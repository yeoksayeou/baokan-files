    Criminal Offenders Must Be Punished
    Today, this newspaper publishes the article "The 'Red and Black List Incident' in Meishan County, Sichuan Province, and its Lessons." This incident reveals that some adjudicators in our People's Courts have adopted an extremely unserious and irresponsible attitude towards the important task entrusted to them by the state and the people: punishing criminals and protecting the people. When sentencing a major case of a counter-revolutionary who murdered people, they may fail to arrest the criminal; and after publicly announcing the verdict, they do not check whether the criminal has been detained; later, when they discover that the criminal has not been detained, they decide to arrest him but forget about it carelessly. This has allowed a counter-revolutionary criminal who murdered two people to remain at large for a long time and even deceive people into granting him the title of model worker. This incident shows that although our People's Courts are law enforcement agencies, some adjudicators do not act according to the law and treat the solemn judgments of the courts as child's play.
    Of course, serious incidents like the "Red and Black List Incident" are rare, but similar phenomena of condoning and fostering crime are not uncommon. Since the beginning of this year, when the central authorities inspected the situation of criminal offenses, they found that the People's Public Security Organs and the People's Courts in some places lacked understanding of the harmfulness of such criminal behavior, and often one-sidedly emphasized education and reform, while neglecting the necessary legal sanctions; some places even merely educated and released, or only sentenced very light sentences, to criminal offenders who repeatedly refused to be reformed, who consistently raped women, defiled young girls, and stole public property. This erroneous practice has fostered the occurrence of criminal offenses, and the fact that many of the criminal offenders captured in various places are habitual offenders who repeatedly refuse to be reformed proves this point. Recently, after exposure and criticism by the People's Public Security Organs and the People's Courts in various places, this erroneous practice has been greatly changed, but it has not been completely corrected, and criminal offenses are still quite serious. Therefore, the public security organs and courts in various places should learn from the "Red and Black List Incident" and thoroughly overcome the erroneous ideas and practices of not acting according to the law.

### 对刑事罪犯必须惩办

    对刑事罪犯必须惩办
    今天本报发表了四川省眉山县的“‘红黑榜事件’及其教训”的文章。从这一事件可以看出，在我们的人民法院中有一些审判人员，对于国家和人民所交付给他们的惩罚犯罪、保护人民的重大任务采取了极其不严肃和不负责任的态度。他们在宣判一件反革命分子杀害人民的重大案件时，可以不把犯人逮捕归案；并且在公开宣布判决以后，也不检查一下犯人是否已经关押起来；以后发现犯人并未被押，决定要扣捕，但又马马虎虎忘掉了。这就使得一个杀害了两条人命的反革命罪犯能够长期逍遥法外，并且骗得劳动模范的称号。这一事件说明：我们的人民法院虽然是执法的机关，但是有些审判人员并不按照法律办事，把法院庄严的判决当成儿戏。
    像“红黑榜事件”这样严重的事件当然是很少有的，但是类似纵容和助长犯罪的现象却不是很少的。今年以来中央有关机关在检查刑事犯罪的情况时，就发现有些地方的人民公安机关和人民法院对于这种犯罪行为的危害性缺乏认识，往往片面地强调教育改造，忽略了应有的法律制裁；有的地方甚至对于屡教不改、一贯强奸妇女、奸淫幼女和盗窃公共财物的刑事犯也只是教育释放，或者仅仅判处很轻的徒刑。这种错误的作法，助长了刑事犯罪的发生，各地所捕获的刑事犯罪分子中有不少是屡教不改的惯犯，就证明了这一点。最近经过各地人民公安机关和人民法院的揭发批判，这种错误的作法虽然已经有了很大的改变，但是也还没有彻底纠正，刑事犯罪行为仍然相当严重。因此各地公安机关和法院应该从“红黑榜事件”中吸取教训，彻底克服那种不按照法律办事的错误思想和作法。
