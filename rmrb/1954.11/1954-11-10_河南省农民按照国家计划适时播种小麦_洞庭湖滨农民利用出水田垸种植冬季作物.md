Farmers in Henan Province, a major winter wheat producing area, have completed sowing over 70 million mu of winter wheat in a timely manner according to state plans. In the low-lying areas of the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province, which were flooded only two months ago, and in the 7 million mu of late autumn land in flood-stricken areas that farmers were most worried about not being able to plant wheat, wheat has now been planted after farmers drained the water and rushed to harvest and plant. Among them, about 60% of the wheat fields were planted early because the Henan Provincial People's Government supplied more than 100 million jin of wheat seeds in a timely manner and issued seed loans of 53 billion yuan.

During the wheat sowing period in Henan Province, the broad masses of farmers carried out a series of technical reforms, such as deep plowing to conserve moisture, uniform and dense planting, selection of improved varieties, seed soaking, and seed dressing. According to statistics from 37 counties in the four special districts of Xuchang, Luoyang, and Xinxiang alone, the area of densely planted wheat this year has expanded more than tenfold compared with last year, and wheat fields using improved varieties and seed soaking and dressing account for more than 50%. The wheat of agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province has mostly been fertilized with base fertilizer. According to statistics from 1.23 million mu of wheat fields in seven counties, including Jiyuan and Huojia, in Xinxiang Special District, more than 800,000 mu have been fertilized with base fertilizer.

Now the wheat seedlings have emerged in various places, and farmers are conducting field inspections and replanting to ensure full emergence. Anyang Special District has universally launched a campaign to inspect blank fields, broken ridges, and insect pests. Thirty-five villages in Anyang County have replanted more than 6,000 mu and eliminated more than 11,000 mu of blank fields, according to statistics. (Wang Haiqing)

The broad masses of farmers in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan are actively using exposed fields and earthen islands to carry out winter cultivation and planting.

In Hanshou County, more than 60,000 laborers are dispatched every day to rush planting. Members of the Wang Zhipan Agricultural Production Cooperative braved the rain to produce, reclaiming more than 270 mu of lakeside wasteland and planting 70 mu of wheat. The Liu Kaihuai Mutual Aid Group in Lianhe Township has planted all 30 mu of drained fields with rapeseed. More than 4,000 farmers in the Fifth District set up sheds on the Xihu wasteland with farm tools and rations to reclaim wasteland and rush planting.

After receiving a large number of rapeseed, wheat, and other seeds from the district supply and marketing cooperative, farmers in Yixin and Fengshu Townships in Yiyang County organized a production commando team of more than 260 people, reclaiming more than 3,700 mu of wasteland and preparing to sow rapeseed and wheat. The Xintian group in Ma Wang Township dispatched more than 70 laborers and 18 head of cattle to plow and rush plant 80 mu of rapeseed, beans, and wheat within three days.

In Taojiang County, more than 60,000 laborers are dispatched every day to rush planting. As of October 13, the county had planted more than 80,000 mu of crops such as rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure. And cultivated 195,800 mu of hardened fields. The planting area of rapeseed and wheat has more than doubled compared with last year. Farmers in the First District also intercropped more than 1,500 mu of rapeseed in fields of buckwheat, broad beans, and wheat.

As of October 25, farmers in the Binhu area had rushed to plant more than 800,000 mu of winter crops. Now, they are still continuing to rush planting on the one hand, and stepping up fertilizer accumulation and application on the other, striving for a bumper harvest of the planted crops next year.

    河南省农民按照国家计划适时播种小麦
    洞庭湖滨农民利用出水田垸种植冬季作物
    冬小麦主要产区的河南省，农民们已按照国家计划适时地种完了七千多万亩冬小麦。两个月以前还是渍水外溢的河南省淮河上游的低洼地带，和受水灾地区农民最担心种不上小麦的七百多万亩晚秋土地，经过农民排水和抢收、抢种，也都种上了小麦。其中，百分之六十左右的麦田，由于河南省人民政府适时地供应了一亿多斤麦种，发放了五百三十亿元种籽贷款，提早完成了种植任务。

    河南省小麦播种期间，广大农民进行了深耕保墒、匀播密植、选用良种、浸种、拌种等一系列的技术改革工作。仅据许昌、洛阳、新乡等四个专区三十七个县的统计，今年密植小麦面积比去年扩大了十几倍，采用优良品种和浸种、拌种的麦田，约占百分之五十以上。全省农业生产合作社的小麦，绝大部分都施了底肥。据新乡专区济源、获嘉等七个县一百二十三万亩麦田的统计，施底肥的达八十多万亩。
    现在各地的麦苗已经出土，农民们正在进行查苗补种，争取全苗。安阳专区普遍开展了查白地、查断垅、查虫害运动。安阳县三十五个村统计已补种六千多亩，消灭白地一万一千多亩。（王海清）

    湖南洞庭湖滨地区的广大农民，正积极利用露出水面的田垸和土洲进行冬耕冬种。
    汉寿县每天出动六万多劳动力，进行抢种。王志藩农业生产合作社的社员们，冒雨生产，开出二百七十多亩湖荒，并种上七十亩小麦。连和乡刘开怀互助组，已把排出的三十亩田全部种上油菜。五区四千多个农民，带着农具、口粮，在西湖荒洲上搭起工棚，开荒抢种。
    益阳县一新、枫树两乡农民得到区供销合作社的大批油菜、小麦等种子后，组织了二百六十多人的生产突击队，开出荒洲三千七百多亩，准备播种油菜和小麦。马王乡新田片组出动七十多个劳动力，十八头耕牛，在三天之内翻耕抢种了八十亩油菜和豆麦。
    桃江县每天出动六万多个劳动力，进行抢种。到十月十三日止，全县已种上油菜、蚕豆、绿肥等作物八万多亩。并耕板田十九万五千八百多亩。油菜和麦子的播种面积均超过去年的一倍以上。一区的农民还在荞麦、蚕豆、小麦的田里间种油菜一千五百多亩。
    截至十月二十五日止，滨湖区农民已抢种八十多万亩冬种作物。现在，他们仍在一面继续抢种，一面加紧积肥、施肥，争取种下的作物明年获得丰收。  （本报湖南记者站）
