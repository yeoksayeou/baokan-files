Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 17th: Commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on Xiamen Island, during lulls in the fighting, vigorously help the island's residents with production labor, air defense, and artillery defense, and bravely rescue victims, receiving unanimous praise from the people.

Since September of this year, commanders and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on Xiamen Island have helped residents build more than 300 various air defense and artillery defense facilities, and bravely rescued 16 residents injured by bombing and shelling by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and extinguished a major fire in a civilian house hit during harassment by Chiang's bandit troops. Reconnaissance companies, artillery command companies, and anti-aircraft machine gun companies of a certain unit, on one occasion, dispatched a total of 170 people who used combat breaks to dig a large air-raid shelter capable of holding more than 200 people for the Xiamen No. 1 Kindergarten in one night, ensuring the safety of the children during harassment by Chiang's bandit troops. On one occasion, when Chiang's bandit planes and artillery frantically bombed and attacked a certain village, Peng Xigui, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit passing through the village, immediately rushed to rescue the victims and their property regardless of his own safety, and unfortunately died after being hit by a bullet. Commanders and soldiers of a certain unit stationed on the front line of the island also used combat gaps to help residents near the garrison harvest crops and cultivate more than ten mu of land, and helped farmers dig more than 300 air defense and artillery holes in the fields, enabling farmers to persist in production.
