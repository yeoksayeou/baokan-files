Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Frontline, 18th. The victory of a certain naval unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in sinking the Chiang bandit "Taiping" warship has greatly encouraged the commanders and fighters of the land, sea, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front. They have expressed their determination to learn from their naval comrades and strive to make greater contributions in the fight against the Chiang bandit troops.

    When the good news reached a certain naval unit that was on patrol duty, the sailors were so happy that they immediately danced and sang on the deck. Zhang Zhaoju, the captain of a certain艇 (tǐng - boat/vessel), said: "This is our role model, and we will strike the Chiang bandit troops hard like them." After hearing the news of this victory, a certain naval unit patrolling on another sea area immediately collectively wrote a letter of congratulations to the naval unit that sank the Chiang bandit "Taiping" warship. The letter said: "You bravely sank the Chiang bandit 'Taiping' warship without suffering any losses yourselves, creating a good example in naval warfare. We will definitely work hard to learn from your combat experience, improve our skills, and resolutely strive to cooperate with the land and air forces to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands." The sailors on another warship also wrote a letter to congratulate the brother unit that sank the "Taiping," saying: "We warmly congratulate you on your victory. We will definitely make full combat preparations and be ready to annihilate the Chiang bandit troops like you."

    The army soldiers guarding a certain outpost island were all excited on the morning of the 14th and ran to the top of the mountain and the outpost positions. While watching the Chiang bandit "Taiping" warship sink to the bottom of the sea, they applauded and cheered excitedly, congratulating the victory of their naval comrades. After hearing the news, the soldiers of a certain unit who were practicing target shooting all expressed that they would learn from their naval comrades, improve their shooting skills, and eliminate more Chiang bandit troops.

    After hearing the news of this victory, a certain air force unit that had shot down Chiang bandit planes many times also wrote a letter to congratulate this naval unit. In the letter, they expressed that they would learn from the combat experience and style of this naval unit and actively cooperate with the land and naval forces to strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

    浙江前线部队欢呼击沉“太平号”军舰捷报
    【新华社浙江前线十八日电】中国人民解放军某海军部队击沉蒋贼“太平号”军舰的胜利，使浙江前线人民解放军陆、海、空军各部队的指挥员和战斗员受到极大的鼓舞，纷纷表示要向海军战友们学习，争取在打击蒋贼军的战斗中建立更大的功勋。
    当捷报传到正在执行巡逻任务的某海军部队时，水兵们高兴得当即在甲板上跳起舞、唱起歌来。某艇艇长张兆举说：“这是我们的学习榜样，我们也要像他们一样地狠狠地打击蒋贼军。”在另一个海面上巡逻的某海军部队听到这个胜利消息后，马上集体给击沉蒋贼“太平号”军舰的海军部队写了一封祝贺信，信上说：“你们英勇地击沉了蒋贼‘太平号’军舰、自己一无损失，创建了海战中的良好范例。我们一定努力学习你们的作战经验，提高技术，坚决为配合陆、空军解放台湾和沿海岛屿而奋斗。”另外一艘军舰上的水兵也写信向击沉“太平号”的兄弟部队祝贺，信中说：“我们热烈祝贺你们的胜利，我们一定充分做好战斗准备，随时准备像你们一样地歼灭蒋贼军。”
    守卫在某前哨岛屿上的陆军战士们，在十四日早晨都兴奋地跑到山头上和前哨阵地上，一面看着蒋贼“太平号”军舰沉入海底，一面兴奋地鼓掌欢呼，祝贺海军战友们的胜利。正在打靶的某部战士们听到这一消息后，都表示要向海军战友学习，提高射击技术，消灭更多的蒋贼军。
    曾经多次击落蒋贼飞机的某空军部队听到这个胜利消息后，也写信向这支海军部队祝贺，他们在信上表示要学习这支海军部队的战斗经验和作风，积极配合陆、海军为解放台湾和沿海岛屿而努力奋斗。
