Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th. The militia in the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province are strengthening patrols and guard posts, actively assisting the People's Liberation Army in defending the coast.

　　Militia patrol posts have been generally established in various coastal areas, and some areas have also established militia coastal defense teams, which patrol the coast at night. Militia in a certain area of Ninghai County have built watch sheds in places close to the sea, taking turns standing guard with guns, watching the movements on the sea day and night. Coastal areas in Yueqing County have organized coastal defense inspection teams with the militia as the backbone, closely monitoring all sabotage activities of the Chiang bandit troops from the sea.

　　The militia in the coastal areas actively capture Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and sea bandits. Militia and fishermen fishing at sea in Ruian County successively captured six sea bandits alive on the waters of Chitou Mountain, Shayuan, etc., seizing six short guns, and won over two sea bandits to surrender. In Xin Zhi Township, Pingyang County, five militiamen discovered a Chiang Kai-shek army sailboat sailing towards Jiucaiyuan, Xin Zhi Township, when they went to sea to fish on the morning of October 22. They immediately went ashore and ran to deliver a message to the local People's Liberation Army coastal defense troops, enabling the troops to defeat an reinforced platoon of Chiang Kai-shek's army in a very short time. The militia of Lipu Township in Sanmen County often patrol the villages at night, and have eliminated one Chiang Kai-shek special agent and one sea bandit each.

    浙江沿海民兵加强巡逻放哨协助守卫海防
    【新华社杭州十八日电】浙江省沿海地区的民兵加强巡逻放哨，积极协助人民解放军守卫海防。
    各沿海地区普遍建立了民兵巡逻哨，有些地区还建立了民兵海防队，在夜间到海边巡逻。宁海县某地民兵，在靠海的地方搭了了望棚，带着枪枝放哨，日夜注视着海上的动静。乐清县沿海地区以民兵为骨干组织起来的海防检查小组，严密地监视着来自海上的蒋贼军的一切破坏活动。
    沿海地区的民兵积极捕捉蒋贼特务和海匪。瑞安县民兵和下海捕鱼的渔民，曾先后在齿头山、沙园等海面上活捉海匪六名，缴获短枪六支，并争取两名海匪投诚。平阳县信智乡有五个民兵在十月二十二日早晨下海捕鱼时，发现有蒋贼军的帆船向信智乡韭菜园方向驶来，他们立即上岸跑步向当地人民解放军海防部队送信，使部队在很短时间内击溃了蒋贼军一个加强排。三门县浬浦乡的民兵夜晚经常在村里巡逻，曾经消灭蒋贼特务和海匪各一人。
