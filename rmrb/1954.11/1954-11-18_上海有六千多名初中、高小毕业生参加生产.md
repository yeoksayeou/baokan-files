    Over Six Thousand Junior and Senior Primary School Graduates in Shanghai Participate in Production
    Since June of this year, more than 6,600 junior and senior primary school graduates in Shanghai have successively taken up production posts. They are mostly distributed in nearly a hundred factories and enterprises in Shanghai's metallurgy, machinery, shipbuilding, chemical, construction, and textile industries, as well as more than ten government agencies and schools. A portion of them have also departed for Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places to participate in economic construction.
    These young students have been absorbed by various units based on the needs of production development and the possible conditions for students to participate in labor production. For example, the No. 2 Factory of the jointly owned Da Long Machinery Plant recently transferred a group of skilled workers to participate in key national construction projects and will continue to train technical personnel for the country in the future. Therefore, in September, it absorbed 55 junior middle school graduates, more than half of whom are prepared to be trained as fourth-grade skilled workers. In addition, the factory is also training 40 apprentices for the state at the same time. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau, due to the increasing number of capital construction tasks, urgently needs to expand its original technical team, and also absorbed a group of young students to participate in the work in early September. Among them, 36 junior middle school graduates were assigned to the design department to learn skills such as drawing, surveying, statistics, and typing. Eighty students are currently studying in training courses and will be trained as hydropower installation workers after a period of practical work. Nearly a hundred young students, after arriving at units such as the jointly owned Mao Chang Refrigeration Company and Yi Feng Enamel Factory, were soon assigned to workshops and offices, which urgently needed young people with a certain level of education to learn technology or take on clerical, archival, statistical, and recording work.

    上海有六千多名初中、高小毕业生参加生产
    今年六月以来，上海市有六千六百多名初中、高小毕业生陆续走上生产岗位。他们大多分布在上海冶金、机械、船舶、化工、建筑、纺织等近百个工厂企业部门和十多个机关、学校，还有一部分出发前往新疆、青海等地参加经济建设。
    这些青年学生都是各单位根据生产发展需要和学生参加劳动生产的可能条件分别吸收的。如公私合营大隆机器厂第二厂最近曾输送一批技术工人参加国家重点建设，今后还将继续为国家培养技术人才，因此在九月间，已吸收了五十五名初中毕业生，其中一半以上准备训练为四级技术工人。此外，厂里还同时为国家代训艺徒四十名。上海市人民政府建筑工程局由于基本建设任务越来越多，原有技术队伍必需大加扩充，也在九月初吸收了一批青年学生参加工作。其中有初中毕业生三十六名分配到设计部门学习绘图、钻探、统计、打字等技能。八十名正在轮训班学习，在经过一定时间实际工作后，将培养成为水电安装工人。将近一百名青年学生在到达公私合营茂昌冷藏公司、益丰搪瓷厂等单位以后，没有多久就被分配到车间、科室去，那里正需要具有一定文化程度的青年来学习技术或担负文书、档案、统计、记录等工作。（新华社）
