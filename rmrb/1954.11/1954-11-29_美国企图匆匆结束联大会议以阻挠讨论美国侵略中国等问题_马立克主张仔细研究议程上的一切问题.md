Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 26th to discuss the work of the Assembly's various committees and the closing date of the current session of the Assembly.

The United States delegation attempted to hastily end the current session, obstructing the General Assembly from conducting careful discussions on important issues such as US aggression against China. This plan by the United States was opposed by the Soviet representative.

Considering the busy work of the various committees, the President of the General Assembly, Van Kleffens, suggested to the General Committee that the closing date of the current session be changed from the originally scheduled December 10th to December 21st. At the same time, he proposed that the two issues raised by the Soviet delegation, "Complaint Regarding the Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the United States Navy for These acts,"  "Complaint Regarding Violation of Freedom of Navigation in Chinese Waters," be transferred from the Political Committee to the Special Political Committee for consideration.

United States Representative Lodge insisted that the current session end on December 10th, advocating that the discussion time for each issue be limited to two days during the general debate on the remaining issues, and that each representative's speech be limited to fifteen minutes. Those attending the meeting understood that this conspiracy by the United States delegation was intended to obstruct discussions on important issues raised by the Soviet delegation and other issues involving the interests of colonial countries. The British representative supported the American suggestion.

Soviet Representative Malik opposed the American suggestion, arguing that all issues on the agenda must be carefully studied. Malik supported the proposal of the President of the General Assembly. He said that as long as the various committees of the General Assembly can complete the discussion of all the issues on their agenda, the Soviet delegation would not object to the General Assembly ending its work on December 21st.

The General Committee meeting ultimately did not make any decision on the closing date of the current session.

    美国企图匆匆结束联大会议以阻挠讨论美国侵略中国等问题
    马立克主张仔细研究议程上的一切问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会二十六日举行会议，讨论大会各委员会的工作和大会本届会议结束的日期。
    美国代表团企图匆匆结束本届会议，阻挠大会对于美国侵略中国等重要问题进行仔细讨论。美国这种打算遭到苏联代表的反对。
    大会主席范克里芬斯考虑到各委员会工作繁忙，在总务委员会上建议把本届会议结束日期自原定的十二月十日改为十二月二十一日，同时把苏联代表团提出的“关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任的控诉”和“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的控诉”这两个问题从政治委员会移交特别政治委员会审议。
    美国代表洛奇坚持要使本届会议在十二月十日结束，主张在就剩下的问题作一般性辩论时，每一个问题讨论的时间只限于两天，在辩论中每个代表的发言只限于十五分钟。出席会议的人都明白，美国代表团的这种阴谋是要阻挠对苏联代表团提出的重要问题以及其他涉及到殖民国家利益的问题进行讨论。英国代表支持美国的建议。
    苏联代表马立克反对美国的建议，主张必须仔细地研究议程上的一切问题。马立克支持大会主席的提议。他说，只要大会各委员会能把它们议程上的全部问题讨论完毕，苏联代表团不反对大会在十二月二十一日结束工作。
    总务委员会会议最后没有就本届会议结束日期采取任何决定。
