    The Soviet Union – A Model for the People of the World
    Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    The 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is approaching. This is not only a major festival for the Soviet people, but also a major festival for the Chinese people and the working people of the world.

    Thirty-seven years ago, the Russian working class, peasants, and soldiers, under the leadership of Lenin's Bolshevik Party, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Tsar and established the world's first state power of the working people. Since then, a new era of the total collapse of world capitalism and the victory of socialism has begun, fundamentally changing the development of human history.

    Before the October Revolution, the lives of the Russian people were also very hard. They were oppressed, exploited, unable to get enough to eat and wear, and the country's economy as a whole was very backward. Its industry was fifty to one hundred years behind other capitalist countries at the time. After the October Revolution, the Soviet working people were able to be masters of their own affairs. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, through heroic and arduous labor, they have built the Soviet Union into the most powerful socialist country in the world, having caught up with and surpassed capitalist countries in both industry and agriculture. It is precisely because of this that the Soviet Union can become a bulwark of world peace, and was able to defeat the German and Japanese fascist countries in the Second World War, rescuing hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia from fascist enslavement. Now, the Soviet people have started moving forward towards the most beautiful realm of human life – communism.

    The October Revolution not only brought freedom and a happy life to the Soviet people, but also pointed out a bright road for the working people and oppressed nations of the world. In the past, no one had ever seen what a socialist society actually looked like; after the October Revolution, the Soviet people built a socialist society with their own hands, turning socialism from a theoretical concept in books into a real society, and proving with facts that the socialist system is the best system in the world today. Since then, more and more people around the world have taken the Soviet Union as an example and firmly followed the Soviet path. Now, from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the East, through the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, to the German Democratic Republic in the West, nearly one billion people in a vast area connected as one have broken free from the chains of capitalism and united into a powerful socialist camp. The struggle of the people in capitalist countries to defend peace and the national liberation struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries under imperialist oppression are also rising day by day. No reactionary force can stop the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism from moving towards victory.

    Our China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has already achieved the victory of the people's revolution, and this victory is inseparable from the October Revolution. Chairman Mao told us that the Chinese people found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The combination of Marxism-Leninism and our country's workers' movement gave birth to the Chinese Communist Party. Only with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party could the Chinese people achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution and have the People's Republic of China, where the people are truly the masters of their own affairs.

    Not only that, after the success

    苏联——全世界人民的榜样
    中苏友好协会副会长  吴玉章
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年纪念日就要来到了。这不但是苏联人民的重大节日，也是我们中国人民和全世界劳动人民的重大节日。
    三十七年以前，俄国的工人阶级、农民和士兵们在列宁的布尔什维克党领导下，推翻了沙皇的反动统治，建立了世界上第一个劳动人民的国家政权。从此，开始了世界资本主义总崩溃和社会主义胜利的新纪元，使人类历史的发展发生了根本的变化。
    十月革命以前，俄国人民的生活也是很苦的，受压迫、受剥削、吃不饱、穿不暖，整个国家的经济也很落后，工业要比当时其他的资本主义国家落后五十年到一百年。十月革命以后，苏联劳动人民能够当家作主了，他们在苏联共产党的领导下，经过英勇艰苦的劳动，已经把苏联建设成为世界上最强大的社会主义国家，无论在工业上或者农业上，都已经赶上并且超过了资本主义国家。正是因为这样，苏联能够成为世界和平的堡垒，能够在第二次世界大战中打败了德国和日本法西斯国家，把欧洲和亚洲的亿万人民从法西斯的奴役下拯救出来。现在，苏联人民又迈开了脚步，向着人类生活最美满的境地——共产主义前进了。
    十月革命不但给苏联人民带来了自由和幸福的生活，同时也给全世界的劳动人民和被压迫民族指出了一条光明大道。在过去，谁也没有看见过社会主义社会究竟是个什么样子；十月革命以后，苏联人民用自己的手建设了一个社会主义社会，把社会主义从书本上的理论变成了现实的社会，用事实证明：社会主义制度是今天世界上最好的制度。从此以后，全世界人民拿苏联作榜样，坚决地走苏联的道路的便愈来愈多了。现在，从东方的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国经过中华人民共和国和苏联到西方的德意志民主共和国，在连成一片的广大的区域上将近有十亿的人民，已经挣脱了资本主义的锁链而团结成为强大的社会主义阵营。资本主义国家里的人民保卫和平的斗争和在帝国主义压迫下的殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放斗争也一天比一天高涨。再也没有什么反动力量能够阻止和平、民主、社会主义的事业走向胜利。
    我们中国，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经取得了人民革命的胜利，这个胜利也是同十月革命分不开的。毛主席告诉我们说：中国人民找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义同我国工人运动相结合，就产生了中国共产党；有了中国共产党的领导，中国人民才取得了中国革命的胜利，才有了真正由人民当家作主的中华人民共和国。
    不但这样，十月革命成功之后，在我国人民革命的整个时期，苏联给予了我们伟大的同情和有力的支援。在中华人民共和国成立之后，苏联又首先同我们建立了外交关系，接着就同我国订立了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，在各方面给了我们伟大的无私的帮助。最近公布的中苏会谈公报，又再一次地给了我们巨大的援助，它对于我们中苏两国兄弟友谊的进一步发展，对于促进我国的社会主义建设，对于巩固亚洲和世界的和平，都将发生极其深远的作用。
    这一切，都说明了苏联是我们中国人民最好的朋友和老师。我们必须更加增进我们中苏两国的友谊，这是我国社会主义建设的重要条件，也是保卫世界和平的重要因素。因此，我们除了和苏联一道加强保卫和平的斗争以外，还要虚心地向苏联学习，学习列宁、斯大林建设社会主义的理论，学习苏联三十七年来的斗争经验和各种成就，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，把我们的国家建设成为一个像苏联一样的伟大的社会主义国家。
