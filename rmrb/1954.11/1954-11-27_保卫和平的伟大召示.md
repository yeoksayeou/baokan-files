    The World Peace Council meeting, which began in Stockholm on November 18, successfully concluded on the 23rd. With the broad participation of representatives from various countries, the meeting discussed various issues related to strengthening and expanding the struggle for peace and unanimously adopted the Appeal to the Peoples of All Countries and various important resolutions and recommendations. These documents and resolutions of the meeting correctly assessed the current situation and clearly defined the course of action for the struggle for peace, issuing an urgent call to the peace-loving people of all countries. This undoubtedly has a very significant encouraging and promoting effect on the current struggle for peace.
    The World Peace Council meeting was held under the following circumstances: the struggle for peace around the world has achieved significant successes, and the end of the Korean and Indochina wars and the rejection of the "European Defense Community" plan have created favorable conditions for peaceful cooperation between countries. However, the American aggressive bloc, disregarding the failures of their war policies, is using every possible means to assemble aggressive military blocs in various parts of the world, trying to revive West German and Japanese militarism, intensifying interference in the internal affairs of various countries, and continuing to pursue a "policy of strength" in preparation for new wars. The struggle between peace and the forces of war is at a very urgent and important juncture. As the World Peace Council meeting pointed out in its appeal for convening a World Peace Congress: "In this world where there are still great opportunities for peace, new dangers have now arisen that may destroy all these opportunities."
    One of the most pressing issues at present is the situation in Europe. This issue is particularly urgent because the American aggressive bloc and its followers, after the rejection of the European Defense Community plan, have made a new decision to revive West German militarism—the London and Paris Agreements. Moreover, the American aggressive bloc and its partners are exerting strong pressure on other European countries, their parliaments, political parties, and social figures to accelerate the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements; under this pressure, some European countries will begin to consider ratifying the London and Paris Agreements from December. The ratification and implementation of the London and Paris Agreements will mean that the people of Europe will once again face the danger of West German revanchism re-invading and provoking a devastating atomic war; it will also mean that the cause of restoring German unity through free elections throughout Germany will be undermined.
    In order to prevent the deterioration of the situation in Europe and to establish a European collective security system, after the Soviet government proposed on October 23 to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the German issue and the establishment of a European collective security system, it proposed on November 13 to convene an all-European conference on November 29 to discuss the issue of a European collective security system. The establishment of a European collective security system will create a solid foundation for peaceful cooperation among all European countries and will eliminate obstacles to the restoration of German unity, thereby promoting a peaceful settlement of the German issue. No country that truly wishes to promote peace in Europe and the world can refuse such a proposal.
    The Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference has been approved and supported by many European countries and the People's Republic of China, and has been supported by peace-loving people around the world. However, the American aggressive bloc and its partners are trying every means to prevent the convening of an all-European conference and openly stated that they will ratify the London and Paris Agreements first and then hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German issue. This is obviously a deception aimed at confusing public opinion in various countries. The peace-loving people of all countries, especially the people of European countries, must resolutely oppose the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements, demand the convening of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, and pave the way for negotiations to restore German unity. The situation in Europe is related to world peace and security; the establishment of a European collective security system will greatly contribute to the consolidation of world peace.
    The current situation in Asia is another pressing issue that attracts worldwide attention. As pointed out in the resolution of the World Peace Council, the tension and unrest in Asia are caused by the war-mongers headed by the American aggressive bloc intensifying the conclusion of war alliances and conventions in Asia, carrying out provocative military adventures, increasingly interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and increasingly rampantly trampling on the people of these countries. The people of Asia deeply realize that the urgent task today is to further intensify the opposition to the evil deeds of the American aggressive bloc, strive to expand and consolidate the peaceful region of Asia, and establish collective peace and security on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    Facts are increasingly proving that the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc headed by the United States poses a great danger to peace in Asia. The United States is eagerly trying to convene a meeting of member states before the "Manila Treaty" has been ratified, in order to create the pretext of so-called "subversive activities" and promote the US's comprehensive plan for intervention and aggression, especially the attempt to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement. Dulles made this very clear when he testified before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 11. This shows how important and urgent it is to thwart the US's conspiracy to use the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc.
    At present, public opinion in Asia and around the world is particularly concerned about the serious situation caused by the US's policy of hostility and aggression towards the People's Republic of China. This is by no means accidental. As is well known, the American aggressive bloc is stepping up its military and financial support for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and flagrantly attempting to conclude a military alliance "treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in order to link up with the Northeast Asian military alliance and the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to form a military encirclement of the People's Republic of China and carry out new military adventures. Therefore, anyone who is truly concerned and willing to ease the situation can clearly see that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is precisely for the purpose of defending peace in Asia and the world; only by forcing the United States to stop its barbaric interference in China's internal affairs and withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other Chinese islands can the crisis lurking in the Taiwan Strait be eliminated and peace in Asia be guaranteed. The World Peace Council's call to "demand an end to foreign interference in China's territory of Taiwan and firmly advocate that the People's Republic of China obtain its due status in the United Nations" is a reflection of the universal demands of millions of people.
    It should be emphasized that the unresolved nature of the Korean issue is increasingly causing concern. The fact that Korea continues to be in a state of division is fundamentally incompatible with the desire of the people of all countries to further ease the international situation and the desire of the Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland. Therefore, the World Peace Council's resolution calling on the people of Asia and the world to "demand the speedy resumption, in accordance with the wishes of the Korean people, of the meeting of relevant countries, with the participation of neutral Asian countries, to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea" will become a goal of the efforts of peace forces in Asia and the world.
    Another major reason for the tension in Asia is the US's policy of reviving Japanese militarism. This is also something that peace-loving people of all countries cannot continue to tolerate. The World Peace Council's call to "oppose the re-militarization of Japan, which threatens peace and security in Asia and the world" fully represents the universal aspirations of millions of ordinary people in Asia.
    In the struggle for peace, a very important task is to demand the realization of disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. The struggle waged by the people of all countries for this goal for several years has not been without effect; fewer and fewer people dare to openly oppose disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The five-nation proposal on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction adopted by the Ninth General Assembly of the United Nations has opened the way for further seeking a positive solution to this major international issue. As long as the countries concerned are sincere and willing to adopt a consultative attitude, it is possible to seek effective solutions in this regard. Discussions on the peaceful use of atomic energy are also welcome. Only by prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war purposes can this tremendous natural force be applied to the purpose of peaceful construction. Therefore, the major powers should first reach an agreement to ban the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and governments of all countries should immediately assume the obligation not to use nuclear weapons under any pretext. However, it is worth pointing out that the ruling groups of Western countries are actively carrying out plans to rearm West Germany, which runs counter to the goals of universal disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Because the result of rearming West Germany will inevitably lead to an intensification of the arms race and increase the military burden on the people of European countries, this responsibility should be borne by those who revive West German militarism.
    The unstable situation in some regions is due to the fact that the American aggressive bloc exerts pressure and interferes in the domestic life of subordinate and semi-subordinate countries around the world, particularly on some of these countries, forcing them to accept enslaving treaties and military alliances. The new colonialism pursued by the American aggressive bloc in Latin America and other regions not only seriously damages the national interests of the people of the countries concerned, but also poses a threat to world peace. People still have fresh memories of the American crime of using violence to overthrow the legitimate government of Guatemala, and recent news shows that the American ruling group is preparing to carry out armed intervention in some other Latin American countries. This situation cannot but arouse the attention and vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world. The struggle of the people of all countries against foreign aggression and for the defense of national independence should receive strong and powerful support from the people of the world.
    The developing international situation requires the people of all countries to take more resolute and forceful actions to defend peace. Peace defenders must further strengthen unity and expand their ranks in order to stop conspiracies that endanger world peace. Therefore, the World Peace Council's decision to convene a large-scale World Peace Congress in the second half of May 1955 with the participation of representatives of all forces and tendencies striving for peace is entirely necessary and appropriate. Such a congress will certainly give new impetus to the world peace movement.
    The documents and resolutions of the World Peace Council meeting are a solemn call to the peace-loving people of all countries. As the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of all countries pointed out: "The people will never let the irreparable happen." The people of all countries will surely warmly respond to the call of the World Peace Council, intensify their struggle to achieve the goals set by the documents and resolutions of the World Peace Council meeting, and advance the movement for peace to a new stage.

### 保卫和平的伟大召示

    保卫和平的伟大召示
    从十一月十八日开始在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平理事会会议，已于二十三日胜利闭幕。会议在各国代表的广泛参加下，讨论了加强和扩大争取和平斗争的各项问题，一致通过了告各国人民书和各项重要的决议和建议。会议的这些文件和决议，正确地估计了当前的局势，明确地规定了争取和平斗争的行动方针，向各国爱好和平的人民发出了迫切的号召。这对于当前争取和平的斗争无疑有着十分重大的鼓舞力量和推动作用。
    世界和平理事会会议是在这样的情况下举行的：全世界争取和平的斗争已取得了重大成就，朝鲜和印度支那战争的结束以及“欧洲防务集团”计划遭到拒绝，都为各国之间的和平合作创造了有利的条件。但是，美国侵略集团却不顾他们的战争政策所遭到的失败，正利用一切可能，在世界各处拼凑侵略性的军事集团，力图复活西德和日本的军国主义，加紧干涉各国内政，继续推行准备新战争的“实力政策”。和平同战争势力的搏斗正处在十分紧迫的重要关头。正如世界和平理事会会议在关于召开世界和平大会的号召书中所指出的：“在这个仍然有着很大的和平机会的世界上，现在产生了可能会把这些机会全部摧毁的新危险。”
    目前的一个最迫切的问题是欧洲的局势。这个问题之所以特别急迫，是因为美国侵略集团及其追随者在欧洲防务集团计划被拒绝之后，又作出了复活西德军国主义的新的决定——伦敦和巴黎协定。并且，美国侵略集团及其伙伴正在对其他欧洲国家、它们的议会、政党和社会人士施用强大的压力，来使各国加速批准伦敦和巴黎协定；在这种压力下，一些欧洲国家从十二月起就要开始考虑批准伦敦和巴黎协定的问题了。伦敦和巴黎协定的批准和实施将意味着欧洲人民重新面对西德复仇主义重行侵略和挑起一场毁灭性的原子战争的危险；同时也意味着使通过举行全德自由选举来恢复德国统一的事业遭到破坏。
    为了防止欧洲局势的恶化，为了建立欧洲集体安全体系，苏联政府在十月二十三日提出举行四国外长会议讨论德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议之后，又于十一月十三日提出了在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议讨论欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议。建立欧洲的集体安全体系将为全体欧洲国家的和平合作创造坚实的基础，并将消除恢复德国统一的障碍，从而促进德国问题的和平解决。任何一个真正愿意促进欧洲和全世界和平的国家是不可能拒绝这样的建议的。
    苏联关于召开全欧会议的建议，已得到欧洲许多国家和中华人民共和国的赞成和支持，和世界爱好和平人士的拥护，但是，美国侵略集团及其伙伴正在想尽办法防止召开全欧会议并公开表示要先批准伦敦和巴黎协定，然后再同苏联就德国问题举行谈判。这显然是一种企图迷惑各国舆论的骗局。各国爱好和平的人民，特别是欧洲国家的人民，必须坚决反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定，要求召开全欧会议来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题，并为恢复德国统一的谈判开辟道路。欧洲的局势关系着世界的和平和安全；欧洲集体安全体系的建立，将大有助于世界和平的巩固。
    目前的亚洲局势，是举世瞩目的另一个迫切问题。正如世界和平理事会决议中所指出的，由于以美国侵略集团为首的战争制造者们加紧在亚洲缔结战争联盟和公约，进行挑衅性的军事冒险，越来越厉害地干涉亚洲国家的内政，越来越猖狂地蹂躏这些国家的人民，就造成了亚洲局势的紧张和不安。亚洲人民深切地认识到，今天的迫切任务，就是要进一步加紧反对美国侵略集团这种罪恶行为，力求扩大和巩固亚洲的和平地区，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上建立集体和平和安全。
    事实越来越清楚地证明，以美国为首的东南亚侵略集团，对亚洲和平具有极大的危害性。美国正迫不及待地要在“马尼拉条约”尚未批准以前就召开成员国的会议，以便制造所谓“颠覆活动”的借口，推行美国全面干涉和侵略计划，其中特别是企图破坏印度支那停战协定。杜勒斯在十一月十一日美国参议院外交委员会作证时，就十分露骨地表明了这一点。这就说明，挫败美国利用东南亚侵略集团进行的阴谋活动，是具有多么重要和迫切的意义了。
    目前亚洲和世界各国公众舆论，特别关切由于美国敌视和侵略中华人民共和国的政策所造成的严重局势。这完全不是偶然的。如所周知，美国侵略集团正在加紧从军事上和财政上支持蒋介石卖国集团，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并悍然企图同蒋介石卖国集团缔结军事同盟“条约”，以便与东北亚军事联盟和东南亚侵略集团联结起来，形成对中华人民共和国的军事包围，进行新的军事冒险。因此，凡是真正关心并愿意缓和局势的人士，都能清楚地看到，中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，正是为了保卫亚洲和世界和平；只有迫使美国停止对中国内政的横暴干涉，把一切武装力量撤出台湾、澎湖列岛和其他中国岛屿，台湾海峡潜伏的危机才能消除，亚洲的和平才能得到保障。世界和平理事会号召“要求结束外国对于中国领土台湾的干涉，坚决主张中华人民共和国取得它在联合国中应有的地位”，这就是千百万人民的普遍要求的反映。
    应该着重指出，朝鲜问题的悬而不决，愈来愈引起人们的关切。目前朝鲜继续陷于分裂的状态，是同各国人民要求进一步缓和国际局势和朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望，根本不相容的。因此，世界和平理事会决议中号召亚洲和世界各国人民起来“要求根据朝鲜人民的愿望，迅速恢复有关国家举行的、并有中立的亚洲国家参加的讨论和平统一朝鲜的会议”，就将成为亚洲和世界和平力量努力的一个目标。
    造成亚洲局势紧张的另一重大原因是美国的复活日本军国主义的政策。这同样是爱好和平的各国人民所不能继续容忍的。世界和平理事会决议中提出的“反对威胁着亚洲和世界和平和安全的日本重新军国主义化”的号召，就充分地代表了亚洲千百万普通人民的普遍愿望。
    在争取和平的斗争中，一个十分重要的任务是要求实现裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。几年以来各国人民为这一目标所进行的斗争，不是没有效果的；敢于公开反对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的人是愈来愈少了。联合国第九届大会通过的关于裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的五国提案，已为进一步谋求积极解决这一重大国际问题开辟了道路。只要有关各国具有诚意，愿意采取协商的态度，是能够在这方面寻求出有效的解决办法的。关于和平应用原子能的讨论，也是值得欢迎的。只有禁止原子能用于战争的目的，才能够把这种巨大的自然力量应用于和平建设的目的。因此，各大国应当首先达成协议，禁止原子武器和氢武器的爆炸试验，各国政府并应该毫无例外地立即承担起不在任何借口下使用核子武器的义务。然而，值得指出的是，西方国家统治集团正在积极进行重新武装西德的计划，这是与普遍裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的目的背道而驰的。因为重新武装西德的结果，势必引起军备竞赛的加剧和增加欧洲各国人民的军费负担，这个责任要由复活西德军国主义的人们来担负。
    由于美国侵略集团在世界各地，特别是对一些附属国和半附属国施加压力和干涉它们的国内生活，强迫它们接受奴役性的条约和军事联盟，就产生了这些地区的不安局势。美国侵略集团在拉丁美洲和其他地区推行的新殖民主义，不仅严重地损害有关国家人民的民族利益，而且成为对世界和平的威胁。人们对于美国以暴力手段颠覆危地马拉合法政府的罪行的记忆犹新，而最近的消息表明美国统治集团又正在准备对另外一些拉丁美洲的国家进行武装干涉。这种情况不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的注意和警惕。一切国家人民反对外国侵略和维护民族独立的斗争，应当受到全世界人民强而有力的支持。
    正在发展的国际局势要求各国人民以加倍坚决和有力的行动来进行维护和平的斗争。和平保卫者必须进一步加强团结和扩大自己的队伍，才能够制止危害世界和平的阴谋。因此，世界和平理事会决定在一九五五年五月下半月召开一次有争取和平的一切力量和各种倾向的代表参加的、规模巨大的世界和平大会，是完全必要的和适宜的。这样一个大会必将给世界和平运动以新的推动力量。
    世界和平理事会会议的各项文件和决议，是对各国爱好和平人民的庄严的号召。正如世界和平理事会告各国人民书中所指出的：“人民决不会让不可挽回的事情发生。”各国人民一定会热烈地响应世界和平理事会的号召，为实现世界和平理事会会议的各项文件和决议所规定的目标而加紧奋斗，把争取和平的运动推进到一个新的阶段。
