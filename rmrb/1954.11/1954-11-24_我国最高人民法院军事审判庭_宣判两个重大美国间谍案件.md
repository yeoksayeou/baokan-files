Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. The Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China recently tried two major criminal cases of American spies carrying out sabotage activities and endangering China's security in our country, and pronounced sentences in open court on the 23rd.

In these two cases, the criminals in the first case were John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau, spy agents of the American Central Intelligence Agency's spy agency stationed in Atsugi, Japan, as well as spy agents Xu Guangzhi, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Yu Guanzhou, Zhang Zaiwen, Luan Hengshan, Zhong Dianxin, Li Junying, and Niu Songlin, a total of eleven people, who were airdropped into mainland China by American spy agencies. The criminals in the second case were John Knox Arnold, a colonel commander of the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" used by the American Central Intelligence Agency to airdrop spy agents, and William Hurl Baumer, a major operations officer of the "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron," as well as the Weidi crew members of the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," Eugene John Weidi, Elmer Fred Luellin, Wallace Lamar Brown, John Woodrow Booker, Howard William Brown, Steve Edward Ziba, Harry Martin Pengjamin, John Walker Thompson, and Daniel Corliss Schmidt, a total of eleven people.

The Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court, in accordance with the law, sentenced these two groups of American spy agents to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment respectively.

John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau are spy agents of the American Central Intelligence Agency. They were successively sent by the American Central Intelligence Agency to work in the spy agency stationed in Atsugi, Japan. In the spring of 1952, Downey personally trained and selected Chinese spy agents and formed the "Wen Team" and the "Shen Team," which were airdropped in Jilin Province and Liaoning Province, China, respectively. In addition, Downey sent the spy Li Junying to be airdropped in Jilin Province, China, to conduct liaison and inspect the activities of the "Wen Team." Downey also personally took an American plane in August 1952 and sneaked into the airspace over Jilin Province, China, to airdrop food and supplies to the airdropped "Wen Team" spy agents. On the evening of November 29 of the same year, he and Fecteau took an American plane and sneaked into the northeastern airspace of China to contact and provide supplies to the spy agents airdropped in China, and attempted to retrieve Li Junying from the air to report the situation. Downey and Fecteau were shot down by the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during this flight and were captured on the spot.

The Chinese spy agents Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Niu Songlin, Luan Hengshan, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Zhong Dianxin, Li Junying, etc., who were airdropped in Jilin Province and Liaoning Province, China, were originally officers of the Chiang bandit army. In 1951, they successively participated in the American "Free China Movement" spy organization in Hong Kong, and received special agent training in Saipan and Chigasaki City, Japan, respectively. Then, they were given weapons and radios, etc., and secretly airdropped into northeastern China by plane. Their mission after being airdropped was to carry out terrorist sabotage, collect our military and economic intelligence, and organize armed riots. The purpose was to prepare to coordinate with the United States to expand its aggression against China. Before these spy agents were sent out, the head of the American Central Intelligence Agency's spy agency stationed in Atsugi, Japan, arrogantly declared to them that he himself would enter China with the American army in the American war of aggression against the People's Republic of China, and called these spy agents "paving the way for the war."

John Knox Arnold is the colonel commander of the American "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing." This wing is a wing that performs espionage missions and serves the American Central Intelligence Agency. The main task of this wing is to airdrop spy agents to China and the Soviet Union, supply spy agents with supplies, and maintain communications. William Hurl Baumer is a major operations officer of the "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron" of the US Far East Air Force. He has flown many times to conduct reconnaissance activities to probe our national defense facilities. On January 12, 1953, Arnold and Baumer led the Weidi crew members belonging to the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" and sneaked into the airspace over Liaoning Province, China, and were shot down by the air defense forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Except for three people who were killed on the spot, the remaining eleven people were all captured by us.

These criminals are the direct executors of the American aggressors' conspiracy to sabotage the People's Republic of China. The crimes they committed directly endanger the security of the People's Republic of China and the cause of peaceful construction.

The Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court, according to the crimes of the American spies, gave them the punishment they deserved in accordance with the law.

    我国最高人民法院军事审判庭
    宣判两个重大美国间谍案件
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭最近审理了两批美国间谍在我国进行阴谋破坏活动，危害我国安全的重大犯罪案件，并于二十三日开庭宣判。
    这两个案件中，第一个案件的罪犯是美国中央情报局驻日本厚木的间谍机关的间谍特务分子约翰·托马斯·唐奈和理查德·乔治·费克图，以及美国间谍机关空投到我国大陆的特务分子许广智、王维藩、王金声、于冠洲、张载文、栾衡山、钟殿馨、李军英、牛松林等共十一名。第二个案件的罪犯是美国中央情报局用以空投间谍特务分子的“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官约翰·诺克斯·阿诺德和“九一战略侦察中队”的少校作战官威廉·赫尔·包莫，以及“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的维地机组人员尤金·约翰·维地、埃尔默·弗雷德·刘维林、华莱斯·拉马尔·布朗、约翰·伍德罗·布克、霍华德·威廉·布朗、斯蒂夫·爱德华·齐巴、哈里·马丁·彭介民、约翰·瓦尔克·汤普逊、丹尼尔·柯里斯·施密特共十一名。
    最高人民法院军事审判庭依法对这两批美国间谍特务分子分别判处死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑。
    约翰·托马斯·唐奈和理查德·乔治·费克图是美国间谍机关中央情报局的间谍分子。他们先后被美国中央情报局派到驻日本厚木间谍机关工作。唐奈在一九五二年春，并亲自训练和挑选了中国籍特务分子，编成“文队”和“沈队”，分别空降在中国吉林省、辽宁省。此外，唐奈又派特务李军英空降在我国吉林省，进行联络和视察“文队”活动情况。唐奈还曾亲自乘美国飞机在一九五二年八月偷入我国吉林省上空，给空降的“文队”特务分子空投粮食和物资。在同年十一月二十九日晚，又同费克图乘美国飞机偷入我国东北领空，联络和接济空投在我国境内的特务分子，并企图把李军英从空中取回汇报情况。唐奈和费克图就在这次飞行中被我中国人民解放军公安部队击落，并当场被我捕获。
  空降在我国吉林省和辽宁省的中国籍特务分子张载文、许广智、于冠洲、牛松林、栾衡山、王维藩、王金声、钟殿馨、李军英等原都是蒋贼军的军官。他们在一九五一年先后在香港参加美国的“自由中国运动”间谍组织，并分别在塞班岛和日本茅崎市受特务训练，然后发给他们武器和电台等，乘飞机秘密空降在中国东北境内。他们空降后的任务是进行恐怖破坏，搜集我军事、经济情报，组织武装暴乱。目的是为了准备策应美国扩大对我国的侵略。在这些特务分子被派出之前，美国中央情报局驻日本厚木间谍机关的负责人曾对他们狂妄地宣称，他本人将要在美国侵略中华人民共和国的大战中随美国军队进入中国，并把这些特务分子称为“大战的铺路者”。
    约翰·诺克斯·阿诺德是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官。这个联队是一个执行间谍任务的联队，为美国间谍机关中央情报局服务。这个联队的主要任务是向中国和苏联空投间谍特务、供给间谍特务补给物资和保持通讯联络。威廉·赫尔·包莫是美国远东空军“九一战略侦察中队”的少校作战官，他曾乘坐飞机多次对我国进行刺探国防设施的侦察活动。一九五三年一月十二日阿诺德和包莫率领属于“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的维地机组人员偷入中国辽宁省境内上空，被中国人民解放军防空部队击落，除三人当时毙命外，其余十一名全部被我捕获。
    这些罪犯是美国侵略者对中华人民共和国进行破坏阴谋的直接执行者。他们所犯的罪行，直接危害了中华人民共和国的安全和和平建设事业。
    最高人民法院军事审判庭根据美国间谍的罪行，依法分别给以他们应得的惩处。
