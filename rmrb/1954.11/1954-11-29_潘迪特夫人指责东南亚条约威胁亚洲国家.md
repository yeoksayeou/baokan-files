    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th. Former President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mrs. Pandit, who is currently visiting Japan, published an article in the Japanese magazine "Women's Public Opinion" stating that the Southeast Asia Treaty is "a threat to the independence of Asian countries." Mrs. Pandit pointed out that the purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty "is not peaceful, but to make the people of Asia (Western countries') tools of war."
    Mrs. Pandit urged Japanese women to "unite with women from other Asian countries to put pressure on their respective governments to agree to adopt peaceful policies."
    Mrs. Pandit also spoke about the damage caused to the Japanese people by American hydrogen bomb tests. She said: "I cannot help but feel angry at those who injure innocent people while testing hydrogen bombs and are not ashamed of themselves. No one, no country, has the right to harm human life casually. When I was in the United States, whenever people asked me my opinion on hydrogen bombs, I always replied: 'You Americans seem to think you can use your hydrogen bombs to intimidate other countries. But this is not possible. What you possess is a force of death. No matter how frequently you can kill masses of people, the masses will continue to live and grow. This is a true force, this is the force of life.'" She expressed her support for the Japanese people's protests against hydrogen bomb tests.

    潘迪特夫人指责东南亚条约威胁亚洲国家
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：正在访问日本的前联合国大会主席、印度潘迪特夫人在日本杂志“妇女公论”上发表文章说：东南亚条约是“对亚洲国家的独立的威胁”。潘迪特夫人指出：东南亚条约的目的“不是和平的，而是要使亚洲人民成为（西方国家的）战争工具”。
    潘迪特夫人敦促日本妇女“同其他亚洲国家的妇女联合起来对她们各自的政府施加压力，使它们同意采取和平政策”。
    潘迪特夫人还谈到美国氢弹试验给日本人民带来的损害。她说：“我对于那些在试验氢弹时伤害无辜的人而自己还不知羞耻的人们不能不感到愤怒。任何人、任何国家都没有随便伤害人命的权利。我在美国时，每当人们问我对氢弹的看法时，我总是回答说：‘你们美国人似乎认为你们能够用你们的氢弹吓倒其他国家。但是这是办不到的。你们拥有的是一种死亡力量。不管你们能够怎样频繁地杀戮群众，群众还是将继续活着和成长。这是一种真正的力量，这是生活力量。’”她表示支持日本人民对氢弹试验提出的抗议。
