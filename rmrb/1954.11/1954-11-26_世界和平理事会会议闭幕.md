Lombardo's concluding remarks elicited a storm of applause.

Subsequently, the World Peace Council meeting was declared closed.

Appeal to the People of All Countries

Just when the world, due to the end of the wars in Korea and Indochina and the rejection of the European Defence Community, was generating hope for détente and resolving disputes among countries, the London and Paris Agreements suddenly confronted the people of all countries with the terrible threat of the revival of the German Wehrmacht. Just when new proposals were put forward that would make it possible for Germany to be reunified, the London and Paris Agreements were about to deal a heavy blow to the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people, satisfy the ambitions of German militarism, and trap Germany and Europe in permanent division.

Just when the progress made by the United Nations on such important issues as disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction was strengthening the hope for peace, the London and Paris Agreements were about to send a signal for an arms race, which would soon become an unbearable burden on everyone.

The ratification of these agreements will not only fail to maintain the possibility of negotiations, but will also create a situation that is full of new dangers to the peace of Europe and the world.

Therefore, the people of all countries face a decisive choice:

Either negotiations with various possibilities of reaching a fair agreement, or arbitrary actions—mainly the rearmament of West Germany and its inclusion in a military bloc, risking the progress made in easing international tensions being reduced to nothing.

The people of all countries must oppose the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements.

The people of all countries must demand the immediate holding of negotiations between the four major powers in order to reunify Germany through free elections and to conclude an Austrian peace treaty.

The people of all countries must demand the immediate holding of negotiations between all European countries—regardless of their political systems—in order to guarantee their security and common prosperity through cooperation between countries.

No government, no parliament has the right to arrange the fate of the people against the will of the people. The people will never allow irreversible things to happen.

They will never allow Germany to rearm, and they will take joint action to open the way to guaranteeing European security and world peace.

Resolution on the Situation in Various Parts of Asia Caused by Foreign Pressure and the System of Blocs and Military Alliances

The World Peace Council meeting studied the situation in Asia and expressed its deep satisfaction with the significant and welcome progress in this region, which contributed to the end of the wars in Korea and Indochina, created conditions for peace in Asia, and helped to ease international tensions. The Geneva Conference was a victory for peaceful forces. The ceasefire in Indochina has meant that for the first time in many years there has been no large-scale war in this region. The joint statement by the Prime Ministers of India and China has concretized the ideal of peaceful coexistence on the basis of the following five principles:

1. Mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty
2. Mutual non-aggression
3. Mutual non-interference in internal affairs
4. Equality and mutual benefit
5. Peaceful coexistence

These principles have been warmly welcomed by the people of Asia and the world, and have been accepted by the governments of Burma, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and the leaders of the Indonesian government. These five principles not only lay the foundation for collective peace and security in Asia, but also provide the basis for peaceful coexistence and friendly relations between all countries if they accept these five principles. These developments have strengthened the solidarity and unity of Asia, and have frustrated the efforts of those who want to "make Asians fight Asians." However, the war-makers are concluding war alliances and covenants, carrying out provocative military adventures, interfering more and more severely in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and trampling more and more unscrupulously on the people of these countries, in an attempt to realize their plans to dominate Asia.

In order to thwart this attempt and ensure peace and security in Asia, the World Peace Council calls on the people of Asia and the world:

1. Expand and consolidate the area of peace in Asia, and establish collective peace and security on the basis of the five principles.
2. Oppose and thwart plans such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the US-Pakistan Pact to create military blocs, make Asians fight Asians, and threaten world peace.
3. Demand an end to foreign domination and interference in all parts of Asia—including Malaya, West Irian (Dutch New Guinea) and Goa—the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from Asian soil; the abolition of all foreign military bases in Asia, and an immediate halt to the dangerous atomic and hydrogen bomb tests that have already had deadly consequences in the Pacific and have poisoned the air and water of Asia with life-destroying elements.
4. Demand an end to foreign interference in Taiwan, Chinese territory, and firmly insist that the People's Republic of China obtain its rightful place in the United Nations.
5. Demand that a meeting of the relevant countries be convened quickly, with the participation of neutral Asian countries, to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea according to the wishes of the Korean people; demand strict observance of the Indochina armistice terms.
6. Oppose the remilitarization of Japan, which threatens peace and security in Asia and the world.

Only in this way can the people of Asian countries consolidate peace, freedom and the opportunity to develop themselves, and contribute to the cause of ensuring world peace.

Resolution on the Situation in Latin America Caused by Foreign Interference in the Internal Affairs of Various Countries

Under the guise of treaties and agreements supposedly aimed at guaranteeing collective security in the Americas, one country alone is constantly strengthening its domination over Latin American countries, and this country's interference in the lives of Latin American countries has become a factor of general insecurity.

The situation currently encountered by Latin American countries is an obstacle to easing international tensions.

These situations are:

Insecurity caused by the policy of war preparations. This policy is manifested in certain treaties and regional agreements that undermine the sovereignty and freedom of Latin American countries, and in foreign interventions such as the recent overthrow of the legitimate government of Guatemala.

Signing bilateral military treaties and regional agreements. These treaties and agreements are intended to promote the political resolutions of the Caracas Conference, incorporate Latin American countries into aggressive blocs, oblige them to devote a large portion of their natural wealth to purely war purposes, and run the risk of dragging them into war in violation of the interests and hopes of all peace-loving people. The enormous and unjustified acceleration of the arms race in Latin American countries is causing great damage to their national economies and the already unstable lives of their people.

Pressure exerted on Latin American countries. This pressure has been manifested many times in the votes of Latin American countries in many international organizations, which has created an obstacle to improving international relations and resolving conflicts and outstanding issues through consultation.

Restricting the freedom of Latin American trade and raw material distribution, with the aim of creating a mandatory market, unilaterally setting prices, and preventing the strengthening of friendly ties with other countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

Restrictions on cultural exchanges with all countries in the world, and pressure exerted on national cultures in order to force national cultures to accept foreign forms.

The people of Latin American countries are fighting to defend their sovereignty and seek the true security of the people of each country and each individual, and in this way they are making an effective contribution to the struggle for peace in the Americas and the world.

The World Peace Council believes that Latin American countries can only achieve prosperity and security by relying on the cooperation of the peoples of the Americas on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

Resolution on the Struggle of Peaceful Forces to Achieve Disarmament and the Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction

Four years ago, the Stockholm Appeal calling for an unconditional ban on atomic weapons was issued.

The movement of people of all countries around this declaration has prevented the use of atomic bombs in Korea and Indochina. The unremitting struggle of the people of all countries has also forced governments to cease military operations in Korea and Indochina.

However, we are now faced with the danger of war again, a danger caused by the accelerated arms race and the continuous development of more destructive weapons of mass destruction.

The will of the people of all countries can and will eliminate this danger once again.

The World Peace Council expresses its satisfaction with the progress made by the United Nations on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. It emphasizes that this achievement was achieved through consultation, thus proving that agreements can be reached through mutual concessions. It was precisely because this method was used that the United Nations was able to unanimously adopt resolutions that opened the way to resolving these issues.

However, the Western countries want to rearm West Germany and bring West Germany into a military bloc through the London and Paris Agreements, which is undermining efforts to achieve disarmament and endangering the achievements that have already been made.

The World Peace Council welcomes the negotiations that are currently underway on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. But it also points out that mankind can only fully use atomic energy for peaceful industrial purposes after it has been banned for military purposes. The World Peace Council believes that it is entirely possible to reach an agreement in this regard and to establish a satisfactory, strict monitoring and supervision system.

The World Peace Council calls on the major powers to redouble their efforts to reach an agreement on these important issues without delay, based on the various proposals currently under discussion. The World Peace Council demands that, before this goal is achieved, the major powers should immediately reach an agreement: to ban all test explosions of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which, given the current level of modern science, can be easily and quickly detected. The World Peace Council firmly demands that governments of all countries, without exception, immediately assume the obligation to never use nuclear weapons under any pretext.

However, these steps are only preliminary emergency measures, and the implementation of these measures should in no way prevent the solution of a major problem: the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction—atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons—and the implementation of universal disarmament. Furthermore, these measures themselves would be a major step towards reaching a broader and more important agreement, and the implementation of these measures could lead to an agreement on the issues of universal disarmament, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of international supervision (including sending inspection teams to various countries).

The World Peace Council firmly demands that the money saved by implementing universal, supervised disarmament be used to improve the living standards of the people of all countries, especially those in economically backward countries.

The World Peace Council calls on the people of all countries around the world to demand universal disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction at all times and in all places. Otherwise, it will be impossible to achieve a peaceful policy.

As long as the people of all countries unite in this sacred struggle and express their desire for peace, mutual understanding and human solidarity to their governments and the United Nations with great determination, their will can and will guarantee the achievement of these goals.

Resolution on the Situation in Dependent and Semi-Dependent Countries Caused by Foreign Pressure and the System of Blocs and Military Alliances

Since its inception, the World Peace Movement has considered the use of violence to keep people in a state of dependency and colonial oppression to be a serious threat to peace.

It has always believed that foreign interference in the internal affairs of the people of semi-dependent countries, incorporating their countries into aggressive treaties, and establishing foreign strategic bases on their territory will exacerbate international tensions.

The London and Paris Agreements are not only a threat to the security of the people of Europe and world peace, but their implementation will have a direct and significant impact on the lives of the people of colonial and dependent countries who have already suffered such arduous, and sometimes even tragic, fates.

The World Peace Council again urges world opinion to pay attention to the threat to peace posed by the situation arising in some dependent and semi-dependent countries. In Malaya, Kenya, and North Africa, there is such a danger: armed conflict may become an open war, which may endanger world peace.

Regarding the Indochina War, the World Peace Movement has stated that it is necessary and possible to end this conflict peacefully. The situation has confirmed our words. The World Peace Council demands that a peaceful solution be found as soon as possible to end the conflict that is currently underway.

In the Near and Middle East, foreign interference in the internal affairs of various countries in various ways, attempting to force them to accept various treaties and military alliances—the Turkish-Pakistani Pact, the Near East Treaty, etc.—has also become a threat to peace.

The World Peace Council declares that relations between all countries, large and small, should be based on respect for the five principles put forward in the joint statements of China and India and China and Burma—principles in line with the Charter of the United Nations.

The World Peace Council believes that ending the armed conflicts currently underway, respecting the independence of the people of all countries, and realizing the national and democratic aspirations of the people of all countries are important factors in easing international tensions.

It calls on world opinion to demand the adoption and application of these principles, which are essential for the security of us all.

Stockholm

Appeal to Convene a World Peace Congress

In this world, where there are still great opportunities for peace, new dangers have now arisen that could destroy all these opportunities.

Only a strong movement of the people of all countries can prevent the world from being divided into hostile blocs, prevent the revival of the armies that have brought us so much misfortune and sorrow, and free mankind from the suffocating arms budgets. Only such a strong movement can guarantee that all countries cooperate for their well-being, their independence and the security of all.

The World Peace Council appeals to all those who are engaged in activities to fight for peace, to every man and woman who longs to be able to live without fear, suspicion and hatred of the people of other countries. It calls on them to unite while there is still time.

It has decided to hold a large-scale World Peace Congress in the second half of May 1955, with the participation of representatives of all forces and tendencies fighting for peace.

Appeal to Commemorate World Cultural Figures

In 1955, the people of all countries will jointly commemorate the anniversaries of the following great representatives of the world's cultural heritage.

Schiller—150th anniversary of his death.

Mickiewicz—100th anniversary of his death.

Montesquieu—20th anniversary of his death.

Andersen—150th anniversary of his birth.

Cervantes—350th anniversary of the publication of "Don Quixote."

Whitman—100th anniversary of the first edition of "Leaves of Grass."

Holding commemorations of cultural figures can help the people of all countries to establish friendly contacts beyond national boundaries, enable them to better understand each other and consolidate peaceful cooperation.

The World Peace Council calls on the people of all countries, writers and artists, scientists, historians and teachers, as well as all cultural institutions and mass organizations, to participate in activities to commemorate these cultural figures.

    龙巴迪的结束语引起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着，世界和平理事会会议宣告闭幕。
    告各国人民书
    正当全世界因为朝鲜和印度支那战争结束以及欧洲防务集团遭到拒绝而产生缓和使各国间不和的争执的希望的时候，伦敦和巴黎协定突然使各国人民面临着德国国防军复活的可怕的威胁。正当提出了使德国有可能重新统一的新建议的时候，伦敦和巴黎协定却要对德国人民的民主和爱国力量施以沉重的打击，却要满足德国军国主义的野心，并使德国和欧洲永远陷于分裂。
    正当联合国在裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器这样重要的问题上取得的进展加强了和平的希望的时候，伦敦和巴黎协定却要发出军备竞赛的信号，而这种竞赛将很快就成为压在每一个人身上的承受不了的负担。
    这些协定的批准不但不能保持谈判的可能性，而且会造成一种对欧洲和全世界的和平充满了新的危险的形势。
    因此，各国人民面临着一个决定性的选择：
    要末是有着达成公平的协议的各种可能性的谈判，要末就是专横的行动——主要就是重新武装西德和使西德加入军事集团，使缓和国际紧张局势方面的进展有化为乌有的危险。
    各国人民必须反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定。
    各国人民必须要求立即举行四大国之间的谈判，以便通过自由选举来重新统一德国，并缔结对奥和约。
    各国人民必须要求立即举行一切欧洲国家——不分政治制度如何——的谈判，以便通过各国合作来保障它们的安全和共同繁荣。
    任何政府、任何议会都无权违反人民的意志来安排人民的命运。人民决不会让不可挽回的事情发生。
    他们决不会让德国重新武装，他们并且将以共同的行动来开辟走向保障欧洲安全和世界和平的道路。

                      斯德哥尔摩
    关于由于外国压力和由于集团和军事联盟的体系而在亚洲各地造成的局势的决议
    世界和平理事会会议研究了亚洲的局势，并对这地区意义重大的和令人欢迎的进展表示深切的满意，这种进展促成了朝鲜和印度支那战争的结束，为亚洲的和平创造了条件，而且有助于缓和国际紧张局势。日内瓦会议是和平力量的一个胜利。印度支那已经实行停火，这使得在这个地区内多年来第一次没有较大规模的战争。印度和中国两国总理的联合声明已使和平共处的理想在下面五项原则的基础上具体化了：
    一、互相尊重领土完整和主权
    二、互不侵犯
    三、互不干涉内政
    四、平等互利
    五、和平共处
    这些原则已经受到亚洲和全世界人民的热烈欢迎，而且已经为缅甸、越南民主共和国和苏联的政府及印度尼西亚的政府领袖们所接受。这五项原则不仅为亚洲的集体和平和安全奠定了基础，而且接受这五项原则，将为一切国家间的和平共处和友好关系提供基础。这些事态的发展已加强了亚洲的团结和一致，使那些希望使“亚洲人打亚洲人”的人们的努力遭到失败。但是，战争制造者们正在缔结战争联盟和公约，进行挑衅性的军事冒险，越来越厉害地干涉亚洲各国的内政，越来越猖狂地蹂躏这些国家的人民，企图实现他们的统治亚洲的计划。
    为了挫败这种企图和确保亚洲的和平和安全，世界和平理事会号召亚洲和世界各国人民：
    一、扩大和巩固亚洲的和平地区，在五项原则的基础上建立集体和平和安全。
    二、反对和挫败东南亚条约组织和美巴协定之类的使亚洲人打亚洲人和威胁世界和平的一切拼凑军事集团的计划。
    三、要求结束外国对亚洲各地——包括马来亚、西伊里安（荷属畿几内亚）和果阿在内——的统治和干涉，从亚洲土地上撤出一切外国军事部队；取消在亚洲的一切外国军事基地，立即停止已经在太平洋上产生了致命后果并且已经用毁灭生命的元素毒化了亚洲的空气和水的危险的原子弹和氢弹试验。
    四、要求结束外国对于中国领土台湾的干涉，坚决主张中华人民共和国取得它在联合国中应有的地位。
    五、要求根据朝鲜人民的愿望，迅速恢复有关国家举行的、并有中立的亚洲国家参加的讨论和平统一朝鲜的会议；要求严格遵守印度支那停战条款。
    六、反对威胁着亚洲和世界和平和安全的日本重新军国主义化。
    只有这样，亚洲各国人民才能巩固和平、自由和得到自己发展的机会，才能对确保世界和平的事业作出贡献。
      一九五四年十一月二十三日
                斯德哥尔摩
    关于由于外国干涉各国内部生活而在拉丁美洲造成的局势的决议
    在据说是要保障美洲集体安全的各种条约和协定的掩盖下，一个国家单独地正在不断加强它对拉丁美洲国家的统治，这个国家对拉丁美洲国家生活的干涉成为普遍不安全的一个因素。
    拉丁美洲国家目前遭遇的情况是一个妨碍缓和国际局势的障碍。
      这些情况是：
    由于备战政策而造成的不安全。这种政策表现在损害拉丁美洲国家主权和自由的某些条约和区域性协定中，并表现在如同最近推翻危地马拉合法政府的那种外国干涉中。
    签订双边军事条约和区域性协定。这些条约和协定是要推进加拉加斯会议的政治决议，并且把拉丁美洲国家并入侵略集团，使它们承担把它们一大部分天然财富用于纯粹的战争目的的义务，并且冒违反和平人民的一切利益和希望把他们拖入战争的危险。拉丁美洲国家的耗费巨大而毫无理由的加紧军备竞赛，给它们的国民经济和已经不稳定的人民生活造成巨大损害。
    对拉丁美洲国家施加的压力。这种压力曾多次表现在拉丁美洲国家在许多国际机构中的投票上面，这样就对改进国际关系和用协商办法解决冲突和悬而未决的问题造成了障碍。
    限制拉丁美洲的贸易和原料分配的自由，目的是要造成一个强制性的市场，由单方面规定价格，并阻止在互利基础上加强同其他国家的友好联系。
    对于同世界上一切国家进行文化交流的限制，以及为了迫使各国文化接受外国的形式而对各国文化所施加的压力。
    拉丁美洲各国人民正在进行斗争以保卫他们的主权和谋求每个国家人民和每个人的真正安全，这样，他们就正在对争取美洲和全世界和平的斗争作出有效的贡献。
    世界和平理事会认为，只有依靠美洲各国人民在平等和相互尊重的基础上的合作，拉丁美洲各国人民才能获得繁荣和安全。
      一九五四年十一月二十三日
                斯德哥尔摩
    关于和平力量为裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器而进行的斗争的决议
    四年前，在斯德哥尔摩发出了要求无条件禁止原子武器的宣言。
    各国人民围绕着这一宣言而进行的运动，阻止了在朝鲜和印度支那使用原子弹。各国人民不屈不挠的奋斗，还迫使政府停止了朝鲜和印度支那的军事行动。
    但是，我们现在又面临着战争的危险了，这是加紧扩军和不断发展破坏力更大的大规模毁灭性武器所造成的危险。
    各国人民的意志能够而且一定会再一次消除这种危险。
    世界和平理事会对联合国在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上取得的进展表示满意。它强调，这一成果是以协商办法取得的，因此证明了能够用互相让步的办法来取得协议。正是由于使用了这一办法，联合国才能一致通过了为解决这些问题打开道路的决议。
    但是，西方国家想要重新武装西德并且借助伦敦和巴黎协定把西德拉入军事集团，这正在破坏为实现裁军而作的努力，并且危害已经取得的成果。
    世界和平理事会欢迎现在正在进行的关于和平应用原子能的谈判。但是它同时指出，只有在禁止了把原子能用于军事方面之后，人类才能充分地把原子能用于和平的工业用途。世界和平理事会相信，在这方面达成协议并且建立令人满意的严格的监察和监督制度，都是完全可能的。
    世界和平理事会号召各大国加倍努力，根据目前在讨论中的各项建议，就这些重要问题毫不拖延地达成协议。世界和平理事会要求，在这个目的还没有达到以前，各大国应立即达成一项协议：禁止进行原子武器和氢武器的一切爆炸试验，在现代科学水平的情况之下，这种爆炸是很容易而且很快就能侦查出来的。世界和平理事会坚决要求，各国政府无例外地立即承担起永远不在任何借口下使用核子武器的义务。
    但是，这些步骤只不过是初步的紧急措施，这些措施的实现丝毫不应当阻止解决一个主要问题：消除一切大规模毁灭性武器——原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器——并且实行普遍裁军。此外，这些措施本身就会是争取达成更广泛、更重要的协议的重大步骤，实行这些措施就能导致在普遍裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭性武器、建立国际监督（包括派遣检查小组到各国去）等问题上取得协议。
    世界和平理事会坚决要求，把实行普遍的、有监督的裁减军备而省下来的费用，用来提高各国人民、特别是经济上落后的国家的人民的生活水平。
    世界和平理事会号召世界各国人民随时随地要求普遍裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。否则，要实现和平政策是不可能的。
    各国人民只要团结起来进行这个神圣的斗争，并且十分坚决地向各国政府和联合国表示自己的争取和平、互相谅解和人类大团结的愿望，他们的意志就可能而且一定能够保证达到这些目的。
       一九五四年十一月二十三日
                斯德哥尔摩
    关于由于外国压力和由于集团和军事联盟的体系在附属国和半附属国所造成的局势的决议
    世界和平运动自从开始以来一直认为，使用暴力使人民处于附属和受殖民压迫的状态是对和平的严重威胁。
    它一直认为，外国干涉半附属国人民的内政，把他们的国家并入侵略性的条约和在它们的领土上建立外国战略基地的行动，会加剧国际紧张局势。
    伦敦和巴黎协定不仅成为对欧洲人民的安全和世界和平的威胁，而且它们的实施会对已经遭受这样艰苦的、有时甚至是悲惨的命运的殖民地和附属国人民的生活产生直接的和重大的影响。
    世界和平理事会再度促请世界舆论注意在一些附属国和半附属国中产生的局势所引起的对和平的威胁。在马来亚、怯尼亚、北非都有这样的危险：武装冲突可能成为公开的战争，可能危及世界和平。
    关于印度支那战争，世界和平运动曾经声明，以和平方式结束这种冲突是必要的和可能的。局势证实了我们的话。世界和平理事会要求，尽速找出和平解决办法，以结束目前在进行中的冲突。
    在中近东，外国以种种方式干涉各国人民的内政，企图强使他们接受种种条约和军事联盟——土巴协定、近东公约等，这也成为对和平的威胁。
    世界和平理事会宣布，大大小小的所有国家之间的关系应以尊重中印和中缅联合声明中提出的五项原则——符合于联合国宪章的原则——为基础。
    世界和平理事会认为，结束目前在进行中的武装冲突、尊重各国人民的独立和实现各国人民的民族的和民主的愿望，是缓和国际紧张局势的重要因素。
    它号召世界舆论要求采取并应用这些对我们大家的安全必不可少的原则。
    一九五四年十一月二十三日
                  斯德哥尔摩
    关于召开世界和平大会的号召书
    在这个仍然有着很大的和平机会的世界上，现在产生了可能会把这些机会全部摧毁的新的危险。
    只有各国人民的强大的运动，才能防止世界被分裂为敌对的集团，才能防止那些曾经给我们带来许多不幸和悲哀的军队复活，才能使人类摆脱压得喘不过气来的军备预算。只有这样一个强大的运动，才能保证一切国家为了它们的福利、它们的独立和大家的安全而进行合作。
    世界和平理事会向一切从事争取和平的活动的人们，向每一个渴望能够不对其他国家人民怀着恐惧、怀疑和仇恨而生活的男女发出号召。它号召他们乘时机还不算太晚的时候团结起来。
    它决定，举行一次有争取和平的一切力量和各种倾向的代表参加的、规模巨大的世界和平大会，大会在一九五五年五月下半月召开。
     一九五四年十一月二十三日
              斯德哥尔摩
    关于纪念世界文化名人的号召书
    在一九五五年，世界各国人民将共同纪念下列的世界文化遗产的伟大代表的纪念日。
    席勒——逝世一百五十周年。
    密克微支——逝世一百周年。
    孟德斯鸠——逝世二百周年。
    安徒生——诞生一百五十周年。
    塞万提斯——“唐吉诃德”出版三百五十周年。
    惠特曼——“草叶集”初版一百周年。
    举行文化名人的纪念，可以帮助世界各国人民超越国界的限制而发生友好的联系，使他们更好地彼此了解和巩固和平合作。
    世界和平理事会号召各国人民、作家和艺术家、科学家、历史学家和教师，以及一切文化机关和群众组织，参加纪念这些文化名人的活动。
