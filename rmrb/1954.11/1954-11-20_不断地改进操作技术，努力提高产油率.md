    Continuously Improve Operating Techniques and Strive to Increase Oil Yield
    Representative of the National People's Congress
    Workshop Director of Siping Oil and Wine Factory, Li Chuanjiang

    The National Oil and Grease Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference, held in Beijing from October 25th to November 3rd, proposed a plan to increase vegetable oil production by 200 million jin in 1955 without increasing raw materials. This is a very glorious task. From our factory's experience, this task can be completed as long as we continuously improve our operating techniques.

    In 1949, the equipment at the Siping Oil and Wine Factory was very old and rudimentary, with only twenty-four manual screw presses, one bean mill, and one steam boiler. These facilities had also been damaged by fire during the war. At that time, our factory could only extract a little over nine jin of oil from every hundred jin of soybeans, but some private oil mills exceeded ten jin. The Party organization and the trade union called on everyone to think of ways to increase the oil yield. Among the employees, some felt that increasing oil yield was too difficult and lacked confidence; others believed that we should first discuss methods to increase oil yield, and then study how to overcome the difficulties. After discussion, we decided that the first step was to use rice straw instead of Ula grass to cover the soybeans, to maintain a certain temperature and moisture. As a result, we extracted an extra four or five liang of oil. We continued to research and found ways to increase the pressure, resulting in an oil yield of ten jin and seven qian, catching up with the private oil mills.

    Under the education of the Party, the administration, and the trade union, the ideological awareness of our workers improved. Many workers joined the Communist Party, many workers joined the Communist Youth League, and I also gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1952. From then on, our enthusiasm for production increased even more. In the labor competition launched in 1952 to welcome "May Day," I suggested that to make the beans "charred on the outside and tender on the inside," we must first ensure that the moisture content of the beans reaches about 8 percent. Implementing this suggestion increased the oil yield to eleven jin, nine liang and seven qian per hundred jin of soybeans (in the Northeast, ten liang equals one jin). But this result was unstable. In order to continue to increase oil yield, we proposed expanding the heated brick bed, expanding the bean sieve, pressing the shriveled beans thinly, and making the surface even. With the efforts of all employees and the support of the leadership, the oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans stabilized at eleven jin and seven liang, then increased to twelve jin and seven liang. Before long, it rose to thirteen jin.

    In 1952, after participating in the technical training class of the former Liaoxi Provincial Trade Union, I became even more aware of the importance of fully utilizing soybeans and realized that if we could extract more oil, it would not only increase revenue for the country, but also allow the people to eat more oil. After returning to the factory, I discussed ways to increase oil yield with my colleagues. We suggested appropriately increasing the workshop temperature and fully softening the soybeans beforehand. The factory director adopted this suggestion, replacing the white lime ceiling of the workshop with a wooden plank ceiling and adding a bean-warming box to fully soften the soybeans. Therefore, the oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans quickly increased to thirteen jin, eight liang and three qian.

    At the first experience exchange conference held in the former Liaoxi Province, which focused on promoting our factory's operating methods, some veteran workers did not believe our record, saying, "I've been pressing oil all my life, and my hair has turned white, but I've never extracted that much!" But we ourselves believed that the oil yield could still be improved. We researched and improved several weak links, such as using Xi'an coal instead of Pinggang coal, because Pinggang coal had a low flame and the bed temperature could not meet the requirements. Using Xi'an coal increased the bed temperature from 70 degrees to 90 degrees, so the soybeans could be fully softened and dehydrated. To maintain the temperature of the soybeans, we also covered the soybeans with burlap bags, thus creating a record of extracting fourteen jin of oil per hundred jin of soybeans.

    However, the oil yield in our factory was still fluctuating, with the lowest being twelve jin, five liang and six qian per hundred jin of soybeans. The main reason was the large fluctuations in the allocation of raw materials and the high moisture content. Just when we were in trouble, workers from a factory in Jiamusi came to our factory to visit. After exchanging experiences, we learned their method of air-drying and sun-drying soybeans, drying more than two thousand jin of soybeans and then putting them on the heated brick bed for softening and dehydration, and the oil yield increased to fourteen jin, two liang and nine qian. At this point, we found a solution to the problem of excessive moisture content in raw materials. Moreover, after the summary and improvement by the superior leading organs, we clearly realized that to increase oil yield, we must: clean the seeds (soybeans), spread them thinly, dry them evenly, set the temperature based on the soybean moisture content, and press lightly and frequently during pressing.

    Has the oil yield reached its peak? No. In 1953, at the advanced experience promotion conference held by the Northeast Local Industry Bureau, according to the laboratory analysis of the Luda Oil Factory using scientific methods, every hundred jin of soybeans contained seventeen and a half jin of oil. We realized that our factory still had great potential. At this conference, we also learned from an oil factory in the former Songjiang Province the experience of softening soybeans with iron plates, because iron plates transfer heat quickly, have high temperatures, and remove moisture from the soybeans quickly. Therefore, we researched and improved the heated brick bed equipment. Because iron plate heated brick beds are costly, to avoid increasing costs, we used cement instead of iron plates. This practice has been promoted in various provinces in the Northeast. At the beginning of this year, we heard that the Goubangzi Oil Factory in Liaoning Province could extract fourteen jin and five liang of oil from every hundred jin of soybeans, so we went to visit and learn. We found that their temperature was more uniform than ours, the time for heating soybeans was one hour longer than ours, and it became easier to extract oil as they went along. We absorbed their experience and changed the heated brick bed for heating soybeans to a two-sided fire, so the oil yield reached fourteen jin, six liang and nine qian. From then on, our oil yield has always been above fourteen jin.

    Continuously increasing oil yield and reducing the residual oil rate in soybean cake is the direction of our oil and grease workers' struggle. In order to further meet the needs of the people's lives and support the liberation of Taiwan, we actively responded to the call of the National Oil and Grease Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference and decided to strive to turn the highest record of extracting fourteen jin, six liang and nine qian of oil from every hundred jin of soybeans into the factory's average oil yield for 1955 (now fourteen jin and seven qian). Our factory's equipment is very backward. If we do not improve technology, the labor intensity will definitely increase after increasing oil yield. We are working with other oil and grease factories in Siping City to study ways to reduce labor intensity and eliminate accidents, move towards small-scale mechanization, and continue to work hard to increase oil yield!

    不断地改进操作技术，努力提高产油率
    全国人民代表大会代表
    四平油酒制造厂车间主任  李川江
    十月二十五日到十一月三日在北京召开的全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会，提出了一九五五年在不增加原料的条件下，增加两亿斤植物油的计划。这是一个非常光荣的任务。从我们工厂的经验来看，只要不断地改进操作技术，这个任务是可以完成的。
    在一九四九年的时候，四平油酒制造厂的设备非常陈旧、简陋，只有二十四台人力螺旋机、一个豆碾、一口汽锅；这些设备在战争中还被火烧过。当时，我们厂每百斤大豆只能出九斤多油，可是有的私营油坊却超出了十斤。党组织和工会号召大家多想办法提高产油率。在职工中，有人觉得多出油困难太多，没信心；也有人认为先不提困难，先谈提高产油率的方法，然后再研究怎样克服困难。大家讨论后，便决定第一步先用稻草代替乌拉草来盖大豆，以使大豆保持一定的温度和水分。结果多出了四、五两油。我们继续研究，设法增加了压力，结果产油率提高到十斤零七钱，赶上私营油坊的产油率了。
    在党、行政和工会的教育下，我们工人的思想觉悟提高了。许多工人加入了共产党，许多工人加入了青年团，我也于一九五二年光荣地加入了中国共产党。从此我们在生产上的劲头就更大了。一九五二年在为迎接“五一”而开展的劳动竞赛中，我提出要使豆子外焦里嫩，必须先使豆子所含水分达到百分之八左右的建议。实行了这个建议，每百斤大豆的产油率便提高到十一斤九两七钱（东北是十两为一斤）。但这个成绩不稳定。为了继续提高产油率，我们又提出了扩大火炕，扩大豆筛，秕子要压得薄，面要匀的建议。在全体职工的努力和领导上的支持下，每百斤大豆的出油率便稳定在十一斤七两，接着又提高到十二斤七两。不多久又提高到十三斤。
    一九五二年，我参加了原辽西省工会技术训练班的学习以后，更加认识了充分利用大豆的重要性，认识了如果能多打油，不仅能给国家增加收入，而且人民还能多吃油。回厂后，我便同厂里的同志们研究提高产油率的办法。我们建议适当提高车间温度，把大豆先行充分软化。厂长采纳了这个建议，便把车间的白灰顶棚换上了板棚，并增添了暖豆箱，使大豆得以充分软化，所以每百斤大豆的产油率很快地提高到十三斤八两三钱。
    在原辽西省召开的第一次以推广我们工厂的操作法为主的经验交流大会上，有些老工人不相信我们的纪录，说：“我打了一辈子油，头发都白了，也没有出过这么多！”但是我们自己却认为产油率还可以提高。我们研究并改进了几个薄弱环节，如用西安煤代替平岗煤，因为平岗煤火苗低，炕温达不到要求，使用西安煤后炕温由七十度提高到九十度，因而大豆能够充分软化和排除水分。为了保持大豆的温度，我们又在大豆上盖上麻袋，这样便创造了每百斤大豆产油十四斤的纪录。
    但是我们工厂的产油率还是忽高忽低的，最低的是每百斤大豆出十二斤五两六钱油。主要原因是原料调拨变动大，水分高。正在为难的时候，佳木斯有一个工厂的职工到我们厂子来参观，经过互相交流经验，我们学会了他们的风吹日晒大豆办法，把二千多斤大豆晒干后再放到炕上软化和排除水分，产油率便提高到十四斤二两九钱。这时我们才算找到了解决原料含水量过多的办法。并且，经过了上级领导机关的总结和提高，明确认识了要提高产油率，必须：籽（大豆）净?薄，干燥均匀，以大豆含水量定温度，压榨时要轻压勤压。
    产油率到顶了吗？没有。一九五三年，在东北地方工业局召开的推广先进经验大会上，据旅大油厂用科学方法化验的结果，每百斤大豆含有十七斤半油。我们认识到我们工厂的潜力还是很大的。在这个大会上，我们又学习了原松江省的一个油脂厂用铁板软化大豆的经验，因为铁板传热快，温度高，大豆的水分也去得快。于是，我们研究改进炕豆设备。由于铁板炕豆成本高，为了不至于提高成本，我们用水泥代替铁板。这个做法，已经在东北各省推广。今年初我们听说辽宁省沟帮子油厂每百斤大豆能出十四斤五两油，便去参观学习，发现他们的温度比我们的均匀，炕大豆的时间也比我们多一小时，而且越出油越省力。我们吸取他们的经验，把炕大豆的火炕改成两面烧火，因此出油率便达到十四斤六两九钱。从这以后，我们的产油率总是在十四斤以上了。
    不断地提高产油率，降低豆饼残油率，是我们油脂工人的奋斗方向。为了进一步满足人民生活的需要，为了支援解放台湾，我们积极响应全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会的号召，决定努力把每百斤大豆出十四斤六两九钱油的最高纪录，变为一九五五年全厂的平均产油率（现在为十四斤零七钱），我们厂的设备很落后，如果不改进技术，提高产油率后劳动强度一定会增加。我们正同四平市其他油脂工厂研究减少劳动强度和消灭事故的办法，向小型机械化的方向前进，继续为提高产油率而努力！
