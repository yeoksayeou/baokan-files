Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th (TASS dispatch): "Izvestia" published an article by Kozhevnikova entitled "Japan's Pressing Issues," commenting on the reaction of the Japanese public to the joint declaration by the Soviet Union and China regarding relations with Japan.

	Kozhevnikova wrote: The Japanese public has been paying close attention to the joint declaration on relations with Japan issued by the Soviet and Chinese governments.

	The reason why the Japanese public is paying so much attention is that the Sino-Soviet joint declaration raises some issues that the broad Japanese public has long been concerned about. Now, nine years after the end of the war, Japan is still in a state of semi-occupation. The United States, taking advantage of its position as a major occupying power, has forced Japan to accept the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and other unequal agreements that force Japan to follow American policies. Facts have proven that this policy is fundamentally against Japan's national interests.

	In this situation, the broad Japanese public is striving to find a way out of the dead end that American policy has led Japan into. American policy is to put Japan in opposition to other Asian countries, especially its neighbors.

	Kozhevnikova pointed out: The Japanese public first saw in the Sino-Soviet joint declaration that the Soviet and Chinese governments are willing to normalize relations with Japan, which is fully in line with the interests of the Japanese people. There is no doubt that the establishment of normal relations between Japan and its neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, will help strengthen peace and security in this region of the world.

	The author continued: All sectors of Japanese society warmly welcomed the willingness expressed by the Soviet and Chinese governments in the joint declaration to establish normal relations with Japan. This proposal is in line with Japan's national interests, as can be seen from the many comments from representatives of all sectors of Japanese society. People of all political views are calling on the government to take this opportunity to improve and normalize relations with the Soviet Union and China.

	The author said: Japan is paying particular attention to the fact that the joint declaration raises the issue of developing broad trade on mutually beneficial terms.

	The issue of foreign trade is of great significance to the Japanese economy, and is therefore a particularly acute issue for Japan today. The United States has effectively prohibited Japan from trading with countries in the democratic camp, especially with China, which has damaged Japan's original trade ties.

	Calls for expanding trade with countries in the democratic camp are rising in Japan. The broad masses of Japanese people recognize that the removal of trade restrictions and the establishment of normal relations with all countries will help revitalize the Japanese economy.

	The author concluded: The reaction of all sectors of Japanese society to the Sino-Soviet joint declaration proves that all sectors of Japanese society are increasingly aware of the need to establish normal relations with neighboring countries and expand trade ties.

    日本的切身问题
    ——苏联“消息报”刊载的文章的摘要
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三十日讯：“消息报”刊载了柯热夫尼科娃的一篇题为“日本的切身问题”的文章，评论日本公众对苏中两国关于对日关系的联合宣言的反应。
    柯热夫尼科娃写道：日本公众一直很注意苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府发表的关于对日关系的联合宣言。
    日本公众之所以如此注意，是因为苏中联合宣言提出了广大日本公众早就关心的一些问题。现在，战争结束已有九年了，日本还是处在半被占领国的地位。美国利用它是一个主要占领国的便利，强迫日本接受了旧金山“和约”、美日“安全条约”以及其他一些迫使日本跟着美国政策走的不平等协定。事实证明，这种政策是根本违反日本的民族利益的。
    在这种情况下，日本广大公众就努力要找到一条出路，走出美国政策把日本引上的绝路。美国的政策是要使日本和亚洲其他国家，特别是和它的近邻处在对立的地位。
    柯热夫尼科娃指出：日本公众在苏中联合宣言中首先看到，苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府是愿意使对日关系正常化的，而这是完全符合于日本人民的利益的。毫无疑问，日本和它的近邻——苏联和中国建立起正常的关系，这将有助于加强世界这一地区的和平和安全。
    作者继续说：日本各界十分热烈欢迎苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府在联合宣言中表示愿意和日本建立正常的关系。这个提议是符合日本民族利益的，这一点从日本社会各界代表的许多评论中就可以看出来。各种政治观点的人都呼吁政府利用这个机会改善同苏联和中华人民共和国的关系并使它正常化。
    作者说：日本特别注意的是，联合宣言提出了在互利的条件下发展广泛贸易的问题。
    对外贸易问题对日本经济具有巨大的意义，因此是日本当前的一个特别尖锐的问题。美国事实上禁止日本同民主阵营国家、首先是同中国进行贸易，这就破坏了日本原先的贸易联系。
    要求扩大同民主阵营国家的贸易的呼声在日本日趋高涨。日本广大各界认识到，取销贸易限制、同一切国家建立正常关系，将有助于复兴日本的经济。
    作者最后说：日本各界对苏中联合宣言的反应证明，日本各界越来越多地认识到必须同邻国建立正常关系和扩大贸易联系。
