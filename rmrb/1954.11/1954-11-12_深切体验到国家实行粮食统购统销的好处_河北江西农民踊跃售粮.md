    Having Deeply Experienced the Benefits of the State's Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain
    Hebei and Jiangxi Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Grain
    [This newspaper dispatch] The broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province have deeply felt the many benefits of the state's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain over the past year. They warmly support the policy of unified purchase and sale and are enthusiastically selling grain to the state.
    In the 1953-1954 grain year, Hebei Province completed 112.4 percent of the state's grain purchase plan. The amount of grain purchased increased by 53.2 percent compared to the previous year before the unified purchase. This has played an important role in supporting the country's construction and consolidating national defense.
    The implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain has guaranteed the needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas, and also guaranteed the grain supply for grain-deficient farmers in vast rural areas and economic crop areas. The amount of grain adjusted by the state in Handan Prefecture reached 69.2 percent of the total annual sales in the area. In order to take care of the lives of cotton farmers, the state also adjusted a portion of refined grain. In the cotton-producing areas of Handan, Xingtai and other six prefectures alone, more than 11 million jin of flour and more than 8.3 million jin of rice were supplied. The state's timely supply of grain to the cotton-producing areas has increased the cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production. This year, the province's cotton field area exceeded the original plan by more than 23 percent.
    Some areas of Hebei Province have suffered varying degrees of disaster. Because the state has a large amount of grain in its control, the people in the disaster areas have received timely rations and seeds supplied by the state. According to incomplete statistics, the disaster areas in Tianjin and Baoding prefectures alone received more than 463 million jin of grain. In addition to being distributed as relief grain, these grains were reasonably supplied to the disaster victims at the local listed price. The Ba County Grain Bureau and the County Cooperative Federation jointly organized large ships to transport grain to nine severely affected villages, supplying more than 2,330 jin of corn flour within three days, ensuring that farmers in the disaster areas had food to eat and strengthening the confidence of the disaster victims in self-reliance through production.
    After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, primary grain markets led by the state were established in various parts of Hebei Province, which not only promptly adjusted surpluses and shortages and ensured the stability of grain prices, but also cut off the connection between farmers and capitalism and promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, the phenomenon of sharp drops in grain prices when new grain was put on the market no longer occurred. Farmers are not afraid of not being able to buy grain, and they don't have to worry about rising grain prices. Li Buyuan, a grain-deficient farmer in Xishangcheng Village, Cheng'an County, Handan Prefecture, bought more than 1,100 jin of grain from the grain department. He said: "Whenever I go to buy grain, it's the same price. It wouldn't work without the unified purchase and sale!" Before the implementation of unified purchase of grain, there were more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province. With the development of the unified purchase of grain, the number has increased to more than 31,000. By the end of September this year, it had developed to more than 71,000. The number of mutual aid teams has also increased a lot. Credit cooperative organizations have also developed greatly.
    This year, the enthusiasm of farmers in Hebei Province for production is very high, and they are enthusiastically selling grain to the state. The farmers in Laozhuangzi Village, Zunhua County, received the banner of "Patriotic Model for Increasing Production and Selling Grain" last year, and this year they are even more motivated to produce. The farmers in the whole village actively used the money from selling surplus grain to buy agricultural tools, livestock, and fertilizer powder, striving to produce more grain to sell to the state. Farmers in Wanggao Township, Third District, Qingyun County, handed over and sold 52,000 jin of grain, of which eight agricultural production cooperatives collectively sold more than 41,600 jin of grain to the state. As of October 27, the grain stored in Hebei Province has reached 94.5 percent of the planned pre-collection and sales.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Various counties in Jiangxi Province have generally convened cadre meetings or party representative meetings, and sent work teams to the countryside to widely publicize the state's policy on the collection of agricultural taxes and the unified purchase and sale of grain, and its great significance. Now the autumn grain collection and unified purchase and sale work has been fully launched. Most areas of the province have begun to assess actual output and calculate and evaluate; in areas with faster progress, grain has already been put into storage.
    In order to do a good job in the propaganda and education of grain collection and unified purchase and sale, the work teams in various parts of Jiangxi Province, after going to the countryside, first convened party and Communist Youth League branch meetings, village people's representatives, grassroots cadres, and activist meetings, conveyed and explained the grain purchase policy and practices, and discussed the major significance of grain collection, purchase, supporting national industrialization, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting disaster areas to restore production. The work teams then divided responsibilities, divided into areas and contracted, and convened mass meetings, women's meetings, agricultural production cooperative member meetings, and mutual aid team member meetings in villages to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization. In the propaganda, the work teams and activists summarized the achievements of the unified purchase and sale of grain last year, helping farmers to understand the various benefits of unified purchase and sale to farmers, and at the same time reviewed the shortcomings of the unified purchase and sale work last year. After repeated publicity, the broad masses of farmers warmly supported the state's policy of collecting agricultural taxes and the unified purchase and sale of grain, and handed over and sold more grain to the state. As of October 26, the province had completed more than 56 percent of this year's grain purchase plan. Many farmers in the province selected good grain to sell to the state. The No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yuantian Township, Yichun County, sold all the grain to the state, which was all full-grained "Nante No." The farmers in Xiangdong District, Pingxiang County, launched a red flag competition for selling grain between groups and groups, villages and villages, and townships and townships, which greatly accelerated the speed of the state's grain purchase.

    深切体验到国家实行粮食统购统销的好处
    河北江西农民踊跃售粮
    【本报讯】河北省广大农民深切感到一年来国家实行粮食统购统销的很多好处，热烈拥护统购统销政策，踊跃售粮给国家。
    河北省在一九五三—一九五四年粮食年度里，完成了国家粮食收购计划百分之一百一十二点四。粮食收购数量比统购前的上一个年度增加了百分之五十三点二。这对支援国家建设事业，巩固国防，起了重要作用。
    实行粮食统购统销，保证了城市和工矿区人民的需要，也保证了广大农村和经济作物地区缺粮农民的粮食供应。邯郸专区由国家调剂的粮食达到全区全年总销量的百分之六十九点二。国家为照顾棉农生活，还调剂了一部分细粮。仅邯郸、邢台等六个专区的产棉区，就供应面粉一千一百多万斤和大米八百三十多万斤。国家及时供应产棉区粮食，提高了棉农的生产积极性。今年全省棉田面积比原计划超过了百分之二十三以上。
    河北省部分地区曾遭受不同程度的灾害，由于国家掌握了大批粮食，灾区人民就及时得到了国家供应的口粮和种籽。据不完全统计，天津、保定两个专区的受灾区，得到供应的粮食就有四亿六千三百多万斤。这些粮食除一部分作救济粮发放外，都按当地牌价合理地供应给灾民。霸县粮食管理局和县合作社联合社，组织大船运粮给九个重灾村，三天内就供应玉米面二千三百三十多斤，保证了灾区农民有粮食吃，坚定了灾民生产自救的信心。
    实行粮食统购统销后，河北省各地建立了由国家领导的初级粮食市场，不仅及时调剂了有无，保证了粮价的稳定，而且切断了农民和资本主义的联系，促进了农村互助合作运动的发展。实行粮食统购统销后，过去新粮上市粮价猛跌的现象已经不再发生了。农民不怕买不到粮食，也不用顾虑粮食涨价了。邯郸专区成安县西商城村缺粮农民李布元，由粮食部门买到一千一百多斤粮食。他说：“什么时候去买粮食，也是那样价格，要不是实行统购统销可不行！”在实行粮食统购以前，河北省共有农业生产合作社一万多个，随着粮食统购工作的开展，发展到三万一千多个，到今年九月底，已发展到七万一千多个。互助组也增加很多。信用合作组织也有很大发展。
    今年，河北省农民的生产积极性十分高涨，踊跃卖粮给国家。遵化县老庄子村的农民，去年得到了“爱国增产售粮模范”锦旗，今年生产劲头更大。全村农民积极把卖余粮的钱买了农具、牲口、肥田粉等，争取多打粮食，卖给国家。庆云县三区王高乡的农民缴粮售粮五万二千斤，其中八个农业生产合作社就集体卖给国家粮食四万一千六百多斤。到十月二十七日止，河北全省入库的粮食，已达预征和缴售计划的百分之九十四点五。
    【本报讯】江西省各县普遍召开了干部会议或党代表会，并派工作组下乡，广泛宣传国家征收公粮和粮食统购统销的政策和重大意义。现在秋粮征收和统购统销工作已经全面展开。全省大部分地区已开始进行摸实产量，计算评定；进度较快的地区，粮食已经入库。
    为了做好粮食征收和统购统销的宣传教育工作，江西省各地的工作组下乡后，首先召开了党、团支部会议，乡人民代表、基层干部和积极分子会议，传达和交代了粮食征购政策和作法，讨论了征粮购粮和支援国家工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区恢复生产的重大意义。工作组接着又分工负责，划片包干，分村召开群众大会、妇女会、农业生产合作社社员会、互助组组员会，广泛进行宣传动员。在宣传中，工作组和积极分子从总结去年粮食统购统销的成绩中，帮助农民认识统购统销对农民的各种好处，同时对去年统购统销工作中的缺点也作了检讨。经过反复宣传后，广大农民热烈拥护国家征收公粮和粮食统购统销政策，纷纷把更多的粮食缴给和卖给国家。到十月二十六日止，全省今年的粮食收购计划已完成百分之五十六以上。全省很多农民在售粮中，都挑选好的粮食卖给国家。宜春县原田乡第一农业生产合作社卖给国家的粮食全是颗粒饱满的“南特号”。萍乡县湘东区的农民开展了组和组、村和村、乡和乡的卖粮红旗竞赛，大大加快了国家购粮速度。
