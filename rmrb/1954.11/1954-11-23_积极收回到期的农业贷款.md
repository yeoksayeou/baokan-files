    Actively Collect Overdue Agricultural Loans
    Wang Jingran

A significant portion of the national bank's agricultural loans are due after the autumn harvest. Timely collection of these overdue agricultural loans can not only withdraw currency, stabilize the market, and support the procurement of agricultural products, but also strengthen the country's agricultural loan funds for the coming year. This year, some regions have suffered severe natural disasters, and in order to support the production of farmers in these disaster areas, the state needs to provide them with loans to help them restore production. Moreover, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations will develop significantly this winter and next spring, and in order to help them expand reproduction, the state also needs to provide them with loans. However, in order to concentrate resources on building heavy industry, it is unlikely that agricultural loans will increase significantly next year. Therefore, actively collecting this year's overdue agricultural loans is an important task in the current rural economy.

There are many favorable conditions for collecting overdue agricultural loans this year. Due to the bumper harvest of agricultural production in most parts of the country this year, the vast majority of farmers who have taken out loans have the ability to repay them. The Sichuan Provincial People's Bank surveyed 488 overdue and due loan households in seven areas with different economic conditions. The survey indicated that 90% of these households, accounting for 91% of the loan amount, have the ability to repay the loans in full. In Ningbo, Jinhua, and other places in Zhejiang Province, a survey of 1,103 households with loans due after the autumn harvest showed that 92% of them, accounting for more than 92% of the loan amount, are able to repay their loans in full. In the barren mountainous areas of Guizhou Province, surveys have shown that the repayment ability of ordinary farmers is generally between 70% and 80%. Secondly, due to the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement and the implementation of credit mutual aid and cooperation work in various places, there are more favorable conditions for recovering overdue loans through these mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

The vast majority of borrowing farmers are positive about repaying national loans. However, some farmers still lack an understanding of the significance of the state recovering loans. For example, some farmers say "loans are like giving away gold" or "money borrowed from the state does not need to be repaid." Obviously, this idea is wrong. It should be made clear to these farmers that when the state concentrates its main forces on large-scale construction, providing a large amount of funds to farmers is to support agricultural production, and it is only right for farmers to repay state agricultural loans during the harvest season. If everyone only cares about their personal and immediate interests, and does not actively repay or defaults on state agricultural loans when they have money, and spends it recklessly, the state will not have agricultural loan funds to circulate, and will not be able to continue to help farmers develop production, which is not good for either the state or the farmers. It should be recognized that our country is a country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Any act that damages the interests of the country is a loss to the interests of the workers and peasants. Conversely, as long as workers and peasants do things that are beneficial to the country, they are also doing things that are beneficial to the workers and peasants. Therefore, the idea that "money borrowed from the state does not need to be repaid" is wrong.

Currently, some places are using local specific materials to calculate several accounts for farmers: the first is to calculate the account of the role of loans. Based on the increase in production and improvement in living standards of the farmers in the village, compared with the past, explain the role of state loans in supporting poor farmers. The second is to calculate the loan burden of the households. Explain how many farm tools can be bought with the loans in the whole area, and how much interest burden can be reduced compared with usurious loans, and how much grain can be bought with this interest. The third is to compare the amount of grain handed in by farmers in the whole area with the accumulated number of agricultural loans, explaining that the state's loans to farmers account for a large proportion of the state's grain income, and the state has done its best to help farmers in production funds, so that farmers understand that actively repaying overdue loans is conducive to the turnover of state funds and is also conducive to the state continuing to support agricultural expansion and reproduction. This inspires farmers to actively repay their loans. After calculating the accounts, many cadres and farmers said: "In the past, we were muddle-headed and squandered the state's money." As a result, they actively repaid their agricultural loans. For example, in the summer loan collection in Gucheng District, Yuxian County, Henan Province, the method of calculating these accounts was adopted, and 83% of the overdue loans were recovered within twenty days. This is a very good example.

In the work of recovering agricultural loans, attention should be paid to mobilizing village cadres and agricultural production cooperatives to play an active leading role. The current situation is that some village and township cadres and some agricultural production cooperatives are not active enough in repaying overdue agricultural loans, and even procrastinate, causing a bad influence among the masses. In the agricultural production cooperatives, the main concern is that they will need to borrow again after repaying the loans, which they see as troublesome. Therefore, some cooperatives with deposits and surplus funds do not repay, and some repay very little. The way to deal with this problem is to first make it clear to the village and township cadres that in the matter of repaying overdue agricultural loans, both cadres and the masses must adhere to the principle of "borrowing and repaying," and no one can be an exception. Of course, for those who have genuine difficulties in repaying, the loans should be extended or deferred, but the masses should be informed to eliminate the mentality of waiting and seeing. For those who deliberately delay, efforts should be made to help supervise and urge repayment through organization and the use of organizational forces. The autumn harvest budget distribution plan made by the agricultural production cooperative must include the repayment plan for overdue agricultural loans. If it is omitted or drawn up too small, it can be suggested that it be supplemented according to the actual situation. If certain agricultural production cooperatives have borrowed too much and are unable to repay, the reasons can be analyzed, such as reduced income due to disasters or excessive debt due to the promotion of chemical fertilizers, new farm tools, etc. When dealing with this, they can be allowed to repay in installments or defer repayment. Conversely, if there are no such reasons, they should not be easily allowed to extend the loan when dealing with it, but should seize the opportunity to recover the loan according to the specific conditions.

In terms of the method of recovering agricultural loans, the "three combinations" method is the most effective. The so-called "three combinations" means promoting the recovery of agricultural loans while promoting the unified purchase and sales of grain and cotton, registering the amount of agricultural loans repaid while registering the sale of grain and cotton, and completing the procedures for repaying agricultural loans while handling the payment for grain and cotton entering the warehouse. Last year, Hunan Province combined the recovery of agricultural loans with procurement, and as a result, more than 90% of the overdue agricultural loans were recovered. In the summer recovery of agricultural loans this year, Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, adopted the "three combinations" method, and the amount of agricultural loans recovered reached 88.4% of the planned amount to be recovered; in Shuyuan District of Wuxi County and Gaoteng District of Yixing, it reached more than 90%. Many farmers believe that this method is: "It saves us the trouble of running around to pay!" Conversely, some places have not closely integrated the work of recovering agricultural loans with the work of unified purchase and procurement, and as a result, the unified purchase has passed, but the work of recovering loans has not kept up. This shows that as long as the propaganda and explanation work is done well, and the work is arranged properly, the work of recovering agricultural loans can definitely be done well.

    积极收回到期的农业贷款
    王静然
    国家银行的农业贷款有一大部分在秋收后到期了。及时收回到期农业贷款，既可起到回笼货币、稳定市场、支持农产品收购的作用，同时也可以增强国家明年农业贷款资金的力量。今年部分地区遭受严重的自然灾害，为了支持灾区农民的生产，需要国家贷款给他们，帮助他们恢复生产；今冬明春农业生产互助合作组织将大量发展，为了帮助他们扩大再生产，也需要国家给他们贷款。但国家为了集中力量建设重工业，明年农业贷款还不可能大量增加。因此，积极收回今年到期农业贷款，是目前农村经济中的一项重要工作。
    今年收回到期农业贷款有着很多有利条件。由于今年全国大部分地区农业生产丰收，极大部分贷款的农民有归还贷款的力量的。四川省人民银行在七个不同经济条件地区调查了逾期、到期贷款四百八十八户，其中有能力全部归还的户数占百分之九十，金额占百分之九十一。浙江省宁波、金华等地调查了秋收后到期贷款一千一百零三户，其中能全部归还贷款的占百分之九十二，金额占百分之九十二以上。在贵州省贫瘠的山区，调查证明一般农民归还贷款能力也在百分之七十至八十。其次，由于各地农业生产互助合作运动的发展及信用互助合作工作的开展，通过这些互助合作组织收回到期贷款，有了更有利的条件。
    极大部分借款的农民对归还国家贷款是积极的。但目前也有一些农民对国家收回贷款的意义仍缺乏认识。如有的农民说“贷款如舍金”，或说“借国家的钱，可以不还”。显然，这种想法是不对的。应该向这些农民讲清楚，当国家集中主要力量进行大规模建设的时候，拿出大批资金贷给农民，是为了扶植农业生产，而当农产品收获的季节，农民归还国家农业贷款原是应该的。如果大家都只顾个人的、眼前的利益，有钱时不积极归还或拖欠国家农业贷款，自己随便胡乱花掉，结果国家就没有农贷资金周转，就无法继续帮助农民发展生产，这对国家和农民都是没有好处的。应该认识，我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的国家，任何损害国家利益的行为，就是工人农民利益的损失，反过来说，工人、农民只要做出了对国家有利的事情，也就是做了对工人、农民有利的事情，所以，那种“借国家的钱，可以不还”的想法是不对的。
    目前有些地方采用当地具体材料向农民算这样几笔账：即第一笔算贷款作用的账。根据本村农民生产增加、生活改善的情况，和过去对比，说明国家贷款对扶持贫困农民的作用。第二笔算贷户负担的账。说明全区贷款能买多少农具，同高利贷对比能减少多少利息负担，这些利息又能买多少粮食。第三笔将全区农民所交公粮折款数同农贷累计数对比，说明国家对农民的贷款占国家公粮收入的比例很大，国家在生产资金上帮助农民已尽了很大力量，使农民了解积极归还到期贷款，就有利于国家资金的周转，也有利于国家继续扶植农业扩大再生产。这样启发农民主动还款。不少干部和农民经过算账后说：“过去糊里糊涂，把国家的钱都糟踏啦。”因而都积极地归还农业贷款。如河南省禹县古城区今年夏季收贷中，采用算这几笔账的办法，在二十天内就完成了收回到期贷款的百分之八十三。这就是很好的例子。
    在收回农业贷款工作中，要注意发动乡村干部和农业生产合作社起积极的带头作用。目前的情况是：有一些村、乡干部和部分的农业生产合作社，对归还到期农业贷款不够积极，甚至拖拉敷衍，在群众中造成不良的影响。在农业生产合作社方面，主要是顾虑还了贷款以后还要借款，认为麻烦。因而有的有存款、余资的也不还，有的归还很少。处理这个问题的办法，首先应该给村、乡干部讲清楚：在归还到期农业贷款问题上，干部和群众都必须本着“有借有还”原则，任何人不能例外。当然对于归还确有困难的，就应予转期或缓期，但应向群众说清楚，以清除等待观望思想；对故意拖延的，则要善于通过组织、运用组织力量帮助督促归还。农业生产合作社作的秋收预算分配方案，必须把到期农业贷款的归还计划列入在内。如果漏列或订得过小的，可建议其根据实际情况予以补作。某些农业生产合作社如果贷款过多而无力归还的，可分析其原因，如由于遭灾收入减少或因推广化学肥料、新式农具等，负债过重等，在处理时，可准予分期、缓期归还。反之，如无这些原因，在处理时即不应轻易准予转期，而应根据具体条件，抓紧收回。
    在收回农贷的方法上，采用“三结合”的办法最为有效。所谓“三结合”，即在宣传统购同时宣传收回农业贷款，进行售粮、售棉登记同时登记归还农业贷款数额，办理粮棉入仓入库付款同时办理归还农业贷款手续。去年湖南省在收回农业贷款时，是结合收购进行的，结果收回了到期农业贷款百分之九十以上。今年夏季收回农业贷款中，江苏省铜山县采用“三结合”的办法，收回农业贷款数额达到计划收回数百分之八十八点四；无锡县墅园区及宜兴高滕区则达百分之九十以上。许多农民认为这种办法是：“交款跑路也免啦，真方便”。相反的是，有些地方由于收回农业贷款工作没有紧密结合统购、收购工作进行，结果统购已过，收贷工作没有跟上。由此可见，只要宣传解释工作作得好，工作布置又得法，收回农业贷款工作就一定可以做好。
