    Sichuan Jiangjin County Achieves Good Re-harvested Rice Harvest
    The re-harvested rice in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, has been harvested with good results. The 72.4 mu of re-harvested rice fields in the Jinzi and four other agricultural production cooperatives in the Thirteenth District yielded 7,490 jin, averaging 103.5 jin per mu. Yuan Liansu, a member of the Gaowu Township mutual aid team in Baisha District, managed the best, with 1.29 mu of re-harvested rice fields yielding 285 jin, averaging 220 jin per mu. This year, the county has over 92,000 mu of re-harvested rice, estimated to produce about 3.5 million jin of rice. After the harvest, farmers in various locations are actively engaging in autumn plowing and sowing. The Diaoshiba Agricultural Production Cooperative immediately plowed the paddy fields after harvesting the re-harvested rice and applied green manure to strive for increased production in the next spring planting.

    四川江津县再生稻收成良好
    四川省江津县的再生稻已收割完毕，收成良好。十三区金紫等五个农业生产合作社七十二亩四分再生稻田，实收七千四百九十斤，每亩平均一百零三斤半。白沙区高屋乡互助组员袁联素经营最好，一亩二分九厘再生稻田实收了二百八十五斤，每亩平均二百二十斤。全县今年再生稻九万二千余亩，约计可产稻谷三百五十万斤。各地农民丰收后积极进行秋耕秋种，刁石坝农业生产合作社收了再生稻后马上犁完板田，下了青草肥料，争取明年大春增产。　（宜华）
