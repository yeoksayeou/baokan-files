    Hebei Province is actively preparing for the upcoming winter farmers' spare-time cultural education campaign. As of now, according to statistics from eighty-seven counties and cities, more than 39,600 winter literacy teachers and township cultural and educational cadres have been trained. With the conclusion of the winter literacy teacher training, the provincial winter literacy campaign is about to begin.
    This year, Hebei Province's winter literacy campaign will build upon last year's winter literacy programs and this year's regular people's schools. Combining it with the development of rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, with village and township cadres, Party members, Youth League members, agricultural production cooperative members, and mutual aid team members as the focus, it will actively mobilize farmers to enroll in schools. It is expected that at least 1.6 million farmers will participate in learning this year. In order to better integrate winter literacy with production, winter literacy organizations will be established separately or jointly in relatively consolidated agricultural production cooperatives this year. In Handan Prefecture, Wu'an, Yongnian and other counties, 363 agricultural production cooperatives have already held winter literacy classes. The province plans to have 50 percent of agricultural production cooperative members participate in winter literacy learning this year. In Shangdu County, Zhangjiakou Prefecture, 45 agricultural production cooperatives have now established winter literacy programs, and this year it is planned to increase this to 169 cooperatives. Currently, the county has equipped 370 teachers for the development of winter literacy programs.
    This year, in addition to requiring students to complete at least one farmer's literacy textbook, reaching "can read, can speak, can write," the winter literacy campaign will continue to conduct in-depth education on the General Line for the students, focusing on educating students on liberating Taiwan, developing mutual aid and cooperation, unified purchase and sale, production for disaster relief, and other current events and policies, in order to raise students' socialist consciousness.

    河北省冬学工作即将展开
    河北省正积极进行今冬农民业余文化教育的准备工作。截至目前为止，据八十七个县市的统计，已集训了三万九千六百多名冬学教师和乡文教干部。随着冬学教师集训的结束，全省冬学工作即将展开。
    今年河北省的冬学将在去年冬学和今年常年民校的基础上，结合农村互助合作组织的发展，以乡村干部、党员、团员、农业生产合作社社员和互助组组员为重点，积极发动农民入学，预计今年全省至少将有一百六十万农民参加学习。为了使冬学能更好地结合生产，今年在比较巩固的农业生产合作社中，将要单独或联合成立冬学组织。邯郸专区的武安、永年等县，目前已经有三百六十三个农业生产合作社举办了冬学。全省今年计划有百分之五十的农业生产合作社社员参加冬学学习。张家口专区的商都县，现在有四十五个农业生产合作社成立了冬学，今年计划增加到一百六十九个社都成立冬学，目前这个县已为冬学的开展配齐了三百七十多名教师。
    今年冬学除要求学员最低限度学完一本农民识字课本，达到“会读、会讲、会写”外，还要向学员继续深入进行总路线教育，着重向学员进行解放台湾、发展互助合作、统购统销、生产救灾及其它时事政策教育，以提高学员的社会主义觉悟。（新华社）
