Title: Why Were Large Quantities of Odd-Sized Timber "Discarded"?

To the Editorial Board:

    In 1952, the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Qingdao sawed off large quantities of odd-sized timber while manufacturing a large number of passenger and freight cars. Among these timbers, many were high-quality red pine planks, but they were "discarded" simply because they were not thick enough (2.5 inches).

    The amount of "waste wood" piled up, creating a messy site, which affected production and could easily cause a fire. This batch of "waste wood" could not be used for carriages, but it was still good material for making furniture. So the factory decided to find private merchants to process it into furniture and sell it to employees. The processing fee was paid with the "waste wood" at a set price. The directives to save wood and the regulations prohibiting the use of raw materials to pay for processing fees were forgotten.

    Private merchants were easily found. Although the factory had many experienced timber workers and technicians, they were not consulted when the contract was signed. The contract stipulated that a small square stool weighing six jin would require 35 jin of wood, and a wardrobe weighing 80 jin (including iron parts) would require 380 to 605 jin of wood. The raw material was several times heavier than the furniture itself. In reality, raw materials only need to be about 20% heavier than the furniture. Some furniture used feet to calculate the amount of material, and the conversion method was six jin per foot (one inch thick, one foot long and wide); however, when unscrupulous merchants sold the wood, it was only 2.2 jin per foot. In addition, private merchants could freely select timber in the lumber yard, and any knots or rotten parts could be cut off on the spot, and unusable parts could be rejected; however, the factory had to bear the "picking labor costs."

    Eleven batches of such contracts were signed one after another, and they were all routinely reviewed by relevant units and approved by leading cadres.

    What were the results of the contract implementation?

    As a result, more than 11,000 pieces of furniture were made, some of which cracked before they were even used and had to be piled up in the warehouse. As a result, the rolling stock factory still "owed" the private merchants a batch of wood, because the people who signed, reviewed, and approved the contract did not calculate how much "waste wood" the factory actually had.

    As a result, in addition to having already sold a large amount of wood, the private merchants' homes were full of high-quality red pine; as a result, some private merchants' wood shops expanded several times because they contracted this furniture-making work.

    As a result, the state lost more than 2 million jin of timber, worth more than 4.5 billion yuan.

    Why did this happen? People are looking forward to their final inspection and handling of this matter.

### 为什么大批零星木材“作废”了？

    为什么大批零星木材“作废”了？编辑同志：
    一九五二年，青岛市四方机车车辆制造厂大量制造客货车辆时锯下了大批零星木材。这些木材中，有很多是质量很好的红松板皮，只是因为不够二寸半厚就“作废”了。
    “废木材”越积越多，乱糟糟堆满了场地，既影响生产，又容易引起火灾。这批“废木材”做车厢用不上了，可是做家具还是上好材料。于是厂里就决定找私商加工做成木器转卖给职工，加工费也用“废木材”作价顶付。至于节约木材的指示和禁止用原料顶加工费的规定，都被丢在脑后了。
    私商很容易地被找来了。尽管厂里有经验的制材工人和技术人员很多，但签订合同时并没有找他们来研究。合同是规定：做一个六市斤重的小方凳用三十五市斤木料，做一个连铁件共重八十市斤的衣橱用三百八十市斤到六百另五市斤木料，毛料比家具重量多上好几倍；实际上，毛料比家具重量多上二成也就够了。有些家具用英尺计算用料，折合方法是六市斤合一英尺（厚一英寸、长宽各一英尺）；但是奸商出卖木料时却是二点二市斤合一英尺。此外，私商可以到木场中去自由挑选木材，有疤节或腐烂的可以当场割去，不成材的可以不要；但是厂方却要负担“挑剔人工费”。
    这样的合同前前后后订了十一批，也都照例地经过有关单位的审核和领导干部的批准。
    合同执行的结果是怎样呢？
    结果，共做了家具一万一千多件，其中有一些家具没有经过使用就破裂了，只得堆在库房里；结果，车辆制造厂还“倒欠”了私商一批木料。因为合同的签订者、审核者和批准者都没有计算厂里的“废木材”究竟有多少。
    结果，私商们除去已经出卖了大量木料外，家里还存满着上好红松；结果，有些私商的木铺，因为承揽了这批做家具的活而扩大了好几倍。
    结果，国家损失了木材二百多万斤，共值人民币四十五亿多元。
    为什么会发生这样的情况呢？人们期待着他们最后的检查和处理。  王荣树　臧鹏
