Shanghai Factories Using Over 100 Tons of Coal Monthly
October Coal Savings Exceed 14,000 Tons
    The work of conserving coal in Shanghai factories using over 100 tons of coal per month has gradually deepened. The total amount of industrial coal saved in October reached more than 14,000 tons, worth more than 4 billion yuan.
    Encouraged by the initial achievements in September, many factory workers have been more actively improving their operations. For example, the stoker workers of the state-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory further improved the double-person mutual-aid coal adding method in October, and established a coal-use responsibility system. Coal consumption decreased by another 10 percent compared with September. The workers of the joint state-private Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory have included coal saving as part of labor competitions and technical innovations. By October, the amount of coal used to produce each bolt of cloth in the factory was reduced by more than 25 percent compared to the past. The work of saving coal in many private factories has also further developed. For example, the workers of the private Zhenfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory actively improved operations in October and promoted the "single-sided coal adding method." Coal consumption decreased from 378 tons in September to 306.8 tons. After the staff of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory repaired the factory's leaking equipment and implemented the thin-coal-layer left-right coal throwing method, the factory saved about 20 percent more coal in October than before. Under the influence of the increase production and frugality campaign, many factories using more than 10 tons of coal per month have also actively carried out coal saving work.

    上海市每月用煤百吨以上的工厂
    十月份节约用煤一万四千多吨
    上海市每月用煤百吨以上的工厂的节约用煤工作，已逐渐深入，十月份节约工业用煤总量已达一万四千多吨，价值四十亿元以上。
    很多厂的工人在九月份取得初步成绩的鼓舞下，更加积极改进操作，如国营上海绢纺厂的司炉工人十月份进一步改进了双人互助加煤法，并建立了用煤责任制，使用煤量较九月份又下降百分之十。公私合营光中染织厂的工人们已把节约用煤订为劳动竞赛和技术革新的内容之一，到十月份，该厂生产每匹布的用煤量，比以前节约百分之二十五以上。很多私营厂的节约用煤工作也有了进一步的发展，如私营震丰染织厂的工人们在十月份积极改进操作，并推行“单边加煤法”，使用煤量由九月份的三七八吨下降到三零六点八吨；大中华橡胶厂的职工检修了厂内漏气设备，并实行了薄煤层左右投煤法后，十月份比以前节约用煤达百分之二十左右。许多个月用煤十吨以上的工厂在增产节约运动的影响下，也积极开展节约用煤工作。
