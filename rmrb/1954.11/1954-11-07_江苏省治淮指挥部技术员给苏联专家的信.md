Letter from a Technician of the Jiangsu Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters to Soviet Experts

Respected Soviet Experts:

    On the occasion of celebrating the 37th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, please allow me to express my warm congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to you.

    I am a young technician who, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, constantly learns from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in my work. I participated in the design and construction of the Sanhe Sluice, the first major gate in the Huai River harnessing project. In the construction of the Sanhe Sluice, I deeply realized the significant role of Soviet advanced experience in China's construction cause. The Huai River harnessing project over the past four years, like other construction undertakings in New China, has been advancing rapidly, and I myself have made progress through constant training. Now I have gradually grown from an ordinary college student into a technical personnel.

    The design of the Sanhe Sluice was carried out in accordance with the Soviet advanced experience – the design of a pileless foundation. It not only saved a large amount of project funds but also greatly shortened the construction time. From design to completion, it took only fourteen months. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in order to decorate the facade of "Guiding the Huai River," they also wanted to build a Sanhe movable dam here according to a set of British and American experience. Not counting the design time, construction alone would take five years.

    During the construction of the Sanhe Sluice, I served as the captain of the steel reinforcement team. Under the leadership of the Party, we learned and promoted the Soviet advanced experience – the assembly line operation method, clarified division of labor, and rationally organized the labor force, so that most workers with low technical skills could learn while doing, and a small number of workers with high technical skills could teach while doing. As a result, everyone quickly mastered the technology, figured out the construction rules, and work efficiency increased by two or three times.

    When reinforcing the steel bars for the bottom plate pier of the Sanhe Sluice, I further realized the importance of learning from Soviet advanced experience. I often took time to read the Soviet "Reinforced Concrete Structure," reading while comparing it with the design of the Sanhe Sluice, and studying with veteran workers like Xiong Keqing, and discovered that the steel bars used for the upstream revetment and the downstream stilling basin of the sluice body were overused. With the consent of the leadership, the spacing of the steel structure on these two foundation projects was increased, and most of the thick steel bars were replaced with thin steel bars. By using this advanced experience alone, more than 35 tons of steel bars were saved.

    Recently, I am conducting surveys and design work for the downstream gravity irrigation experimental area of the Huai River. In my work, I will definitely work harder to learn from Soviet advanced experience and contribute all my strength to the water conservancy cause of New China.

    Wishing the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union lasting forever!

    Song Naicong, Technician of the Jiangsu Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters

    江苏省治淮指挥部技术员给苏联专家的信敬爱的苏联专家：
    在庆祝十月社会主义革命三十七周年的时候，请允许我向你们表示热烈的祝贺和衷心的感激。
    我是一个青年技术员，在中国共产党和毛主席的教导下，在工作中不断地学习苏联的先进经验。我曾参加过治淮工程中的第一大闸三河闸的设计和施工。在建设三河闸的工程中，我深刻地体会到苏联先进经验对我国建设事业的重大作用。四年来的治淮工程，和新中国的其他各项建设事业一样，在突飞猛进，我自己也在不断的锻炼中得到进步。现在我已逐步由一个普通的大学生成长为一个技术人员了。
    三河闸的设计，是按照苏联的先进经验——无桩基础的设计进行的。它不但节约了大批工程经费，而且大大地缩短了施工时间，从设计到施工完毕，一共只用了十四个月的时间。过去国民党反动统治时期，为了装璜“导淮”的门面，也曾想按照英美的一套经验，在这里造什么三河活动坝，设计的时间不算，单施工就得五年。
    在三河闸施工的时候，我担任了钢筋大队的队长。在党的领导下，我们学习和推行了苏联的先进经验——流水作业法，明确分工，合理组织劳动力，使大部分技术水平低的工人边做边学，小部分技术水平高的工人边做边教，结果大家很快掌握了技术，摸到了施工规律，工作效率提高了两三倍。
    在三河闸底板门墩扎钢筋的时候，我进一步认识到学习苏联先进经验的重要意义，常常抽空阅读苏联的“钢筋混凝土结构学”，一边阅读，一边对照三河闸的设计，并和老工人熊克卿等人研究，发现了闸身上游护坦和下游消力塘的钢筋多用了。经领导方面同意，把这两项基础工程上的钢筋结构间距加大，把大部分粗钢筋改用细钢筋，仅运用这一项先进经验，就节约了三十五吨多钢筋。
    最近我正在进行淮河下游自流灌溉试验区的勘查和设计工作。在工作中，我一定更加努力学习苏联先进经验，为新中国的水利事业贡献自己一切的力量。
    敬祝中苏两国伟大的友谊万岁！
    江苏省治淮指挥部技术员　宋乃聪
