The steppe is covered with white snow, and horse-drawn carriages speed across the frozen Hailar River. The pasture grass on the steppe is particularly good this year, with an inch of green still visible under the dried stalks. Large herds of cattle, horses, and sheep are scattered across the winter pastures, quietly grazing.

The Mongolian herdsmen of the Hatanbulag pastoral area in Inner Mongolia have begun a settled nomadic winter life. The yurts in the settlement of the Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative are surrounded by thick white felt. To the north of the four neat yurts are newly built cattle sheds. Near the settlement are piles of sheep grass and animal dung (fuel). Since the establishment of this cooperative, members have continuously received gifts and letters from people all over the country. In the yurts of Huheletai and Sidebu, there are Mao Zedong embroidered portraits and frames presented by the former Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, as well as radios given by the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station. The elderly, women, and children who are not suitable for moving with the livestock are gradually concentrated here. Hardworking women tend to household chores and raise newborn calves and lambs.

On November 19th, the third snowfall came to the steppe. Huheletai and cooperative member Shengde went to the cattle herding group, separated more than fifty calves, and drove them back to the settlement, placing them in the sheds. The sheds are spacious and clean, with dry dung powder spread on the ground, and fodder and clean water provided. The calves, having eaten their fill and drunk their fill, called out, crowded together, and amused each other.

North of the settlement, across the Hailar River, lies a pasture called "Sandanhua" and "Tailetu." Cooperative members Suguer and Wulan led two nomadic groups to graze more than two thousand head of cattle, horses, and fat sheep here. In the morning, after drinking milk tea and smoking a few pipes, the cooperative members rode their horses to drive the cattle and sheep out to graze. Now is the mating season for the sheep. Thirty-eight rams and ewes graze and mate on the pasture. In addition, a small group of Merino crossbred improved sheep is also being bred. Next spring, these sheep will produce a large number of lambs.

The sun has set, and the herdsmen and livestock have returned to the winter camp one after another. The women use ice to boil a pot of clean water, cooking steaming oily milk tea and mutton noodles. After washing their faces, the herdsmen comfortably sit around the stove, chatting and eating dinner. After dinner, some men go out to guard the livestock, while others turn on the radio to listen to news broadcasts and entertainment programs. The women are busy sewing new leather clothes and leather boots for their families, and some are reading Mongolian magazines. The cooperative's herdsmen are thus enjoying their winter life.

    哈坦胡硕草原的冬天
    新华社记者  阿·加那斯弟  石云子
    草原上铺满了白雪，海拉尔河的冰上奔驰着马车。今年草原上的牧草特别好，在干枯了的茎下，现在还显露着一寸高的绿色。大群的牛、马、羊散布在冬季牧场上，静静地吃着草。
    内蒙古哈坦胡硕牧区的蒙族牧民们，开始了定居游牧的冬季生活。胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社定居地的蒙古包，围上了厚厚的白毡子。在整齐的四个蒙古包北面，排列着新建的牛棚。定居地附近，堆着羊草和畜粪（燃料）。这个合作社成立后，社员们曾不断地接到各地人民送给的礼物和信件，在胡和勒泰和斯德布的蒙古包里，挂着原中央人民政府民族事务委员会赠给的毛主席绣像和镜框，还放着内蒙古人民广播电台送给的收音机。不适宜跟着牲畜游动的老人、妇女和儿童，逐渐集中到这里来居住。勤劳的妇女们，一面料理着家务，一面饲养今年新生的小牛和小羊。
    十一月十九日，草原上降第三次雪。胡和勒泰和社员笙德，到牛群游牧组去，分出五十多头小牛，赶回定居地，把它们安置在棚圈里。棚圈又宽敞又清洁，地上垫着干粪末，放着饲草和清水。小牛吃饱了草，喝足了水，就叫着、拥挤着互相逗乐。
    从定居地往北，跨过海拉尔河，有一片名叫“散丹花”和“泰乐图”的牧场。社员苏固尔和乌兰带领两个游牧组，在这里放牧着两千多头大牛、骏马和肥羊。早晨，社员们喝完奶茶，吸几袋烟，就骑上马赶着牛群和羊群出去放牧。现在正是给羊只交配的时期，三十八只种公羊和母绵羊在牧场上一面吃草，一面交配。另外还有一小群美利奴杂种改良羊，也进行着配种。到明年春天，这些羊只将产下大批羔子。
    太阳落下了山，牧民和畜群陆续回到冬营地。妇女们用冰块烧出一锅清水，煮着热气腾腾的带油奶茶和羊肉面。牧民们洗完脸，舒适地围坐在火炉旁，一面闲谈，一面吃晚饭。饭后，男人们有的出去看守牲畜，有的扭开收音机收听新闻广播和文艺节目。妇女们忙着给自己一家人缝制新皮衣和新皮靴，有的阅读着蒙文杂志。合作社的牧民们就这样愉快地过着冬季生活。
