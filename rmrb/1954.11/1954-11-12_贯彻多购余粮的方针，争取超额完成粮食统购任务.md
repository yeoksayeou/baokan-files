    The large-scale autumn grain requisition and unified purchase work has begun nationwide. The central issue at present is to strive to implement the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible, based on needs and possibilities, combined with local realities, and to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's grain unified purchase task.
    As everyone knows, next year will be the third year of our country's first five-year construction plan. Many large construction projects will begin, and the population of cities and industrial and mining areas will inevitably continue to increase. The state advocates increasing the production of cotton and oil crops, and the number of farmers who do not produce grain will also increase. All of this requires the state to supply more grain to meet their needs. This year, some areas of our country have suffered from floods. The state, based on the severity of the disasters in these areas, will reduce or exempt grain purchases, and will also provide a large amount of grain to the farmers who have suffered too much from the disasters to provide relief and sell to them. All of this shows that the need for grain from the state and the people has increased.
    However, our country still lacks sufficient grain reserves and social reserves, which urgently requires the state to master the necessary reserves. This is not only because the main force of grain production in our country is still the very unstable small-scale peasant economy, but also because we cannot completely avoid natural disasters. Without sufficient grain reserves, we cannot guarantee the smooth progress of the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, in the grain policy, in addition to levying a certain amount of agricultural tax, the state must implement the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible. This policy must be implemented this year and must continue to be implemented in the next few years.
    Implementing the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible is not only necessary, but also possible. This year, except for the areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and other parts of the country that have suffered from disasters and reduced production, non-disaster areas, which account for more than 90 percent of the country's cultivated land, have had bumper harvests. According to preliminary estimates, the total grain output of the country has increased compared to last year; however, the state's task of collecting and purchasing grain this year has not increased much compared to the actual amount of grain collected and purchased last year. This means that the increase in grain production this year is large, while the increase in the amount of grain collected and purchased by the state is small. On the basis of increased grain production, it should be entirely possible to purchase some more surplus grain appropriately.
    In recent years, due to the state's policy of rewarding agricultural production and continuous bumper harvests, the state overfulfilled the grain purchase plan by 14.6 percent last year. After overfulfilling the state's grain purchase plan, in addition to farmers' rations, seeds, and feed, there is still a portion of surplus grain in rural areas. In the three months from March to May this year, farmers voluntarily sold about 4 billion catties of surplus grain in the rural grain market under the leadership of the state, indicating that there is still surplus grain in rural areas. Therefore, it is also possible for the state to purchase more surplus grain this year after leaving farmers' rations and necessary feed and seeds.
    There are many favorable conditions for the unified purchase of grain this year. First of all, the leading organs and the vast number of cadres of the Party committees and people's governments at all levels have a general understanding of the production, consumption, surplus, and shortage of grain in rural areas after last year's unified purchase and sale of grain, and have gradually accumulated some experience in their work. This will certainly play a great role in correctly implementing the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible. Secondly, the broad masses of farmers have generally received education on the general task of the transition period, and their socialist consciousness has been greatly improved. The tremendous changes that have taken place in rural areas after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain have vividly educated the broad masses of farmers, making them truly realize the correct relationship between the state and individuals, industry and agriculture, and current and long-term interests. Over the past year, many farmers have gained huge practical benefits from stable grain prices, stable prices of various commodities, and grain sales savings. Farmers have seen particularly clearly that due to the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, not only is the supply in disaster areas guaranteed in the event of such a serious flood this year, but also the grain prices remain stable. Therefore, the people in the disaster areas of Hebei say that the state's unified purchase and sale of grain policy is a life-saving policy, and this is not accidental. Therefore, the enthusiasm of farmers to sell more surplus grain this year is very high. This is a positive and favorable factor in this year's unified purchase of grain. As long as we do a good job in ideological mobilization and fully promote these favorable factors, the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible can be smoothly implemented.
    Some people think that the state's policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible is contradictory to the unified purchase policy. This is incorrect. Of course, under the conditions of a small-scale peasant economy, it is very difficult to fully understand the output, consumption, and feed situations, which makes it a difficult task to achieve consistency between tasks and policies in actual work; however, it is possible to generally understand the output, consumption, and feed situations through practical investigation and research and repeated publicity and education. If we also pay attention to the fact that a portion of surplus grain is left in rural areas after the unified purchase, then we should believe that it is entirely possible to make the tasks consistent with the policies. Therefore, the view that there is a contradiction between the tasks and the policies is incorrect, and it will make us unwilling to carry out many practical tasks diligently and conscientiously in the implementation. It should be known that the state's grain unified purchase policy is the policy of unified purchase of farmers' surplus grain. Therefore, purchasing as much surplus grain as possible from farmers other than rations, seeds, feed, and a portion of mobile grain is a further implementation of the state's grain unified purchase policy.
    In addition, we should also see that due to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, some farmers still need to carry out adjustment and turnover grain sales for production and living needs. In addition to selling this part of grain in the national grain market, they also require the state to purchase it at a certain time, otherwise they will not be able to carry out production and living turnover. In this case, the state should purchase it in order to solve their difficulties. However, we must never be satisfied with this kind of purchase, and we cannot rely on purchasing this kind of grain to complete the unified purchase task, because doing so will excessively purchase turnover and adjustment grain, while the surplus grain in rural areas will be purchased insufficiently. As a result, the sales figures in the sales season will greatly increase, and the rich peasants will take the opportunity to disrupt the market and engage in speculation, promote the development of rural capitalism and spontaneous forces, and put us in a passive position. This must be highly vigilant.
    In order to better implement the policy of purchasing more surplus grain, all localities must fully promote democracy, repeatedly discuss the assigned tasks, and implement the spirit of seeking truth from facts, so that the tasks are more in line with the actual situation of surplus grain. We must oppose the purely task-oriented viewpoint and the practice of mandatory apportionment of tasks, which is completely contrary to the grain purchase policy.
    In order to correctly implement the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible, the current important task is to first seriously convene meetings of village Party members, cadres, and activists after the three-level cadre meetings of counties, districts, and townships have been held. Through these meetings, the state's policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible, its significance, and the working methods for implementing this policy must be repeatedly explained to them, so as to improve their political awareness and policy level. This is the guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the grain unified purchase task. The vast number of rural Party members and cadres are the specific implementers of the grain unified purchase policy, and are the direct guides of the peasant masses, and most of them have surplus grain. The vast majority of them are local people and have extensive connections with families and relatives. As long as they have a correct understanding of the state's policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible, and their awareness and policy level have been improved, they can first take the lead and mobilize relatives and friends to report the actual output and sell the surplus grain in accordance with state regulations, which can drive the broad masses of peasants to enthusiastically sell the surplus grain. Therefore, unblocking the thinking of Party members, League members, and cadres is the key to completing the grain unified purchase task.
    However, we must never underestimate the arduousness and complexity of the work, and we must never think that there are no difficulties in the work. Judging from the recent situation reflected in some three-level cadre meetings, it is precisely because cadres are the key that this year's work is very arduous, very complicated, and has many new difficulties. The main reason is that some cadres cannot realistically report their own and the output of their districts, townships, and villages. Many cadres have a fear of difficulties, either because there have been problems in their work and they have been criticized, or because they are afraid of offending the masses, or (mainly young activists) they cannot be the masters in their families and have been angry at home last year, so they dare not take the lead and are afraid of being ridiculed by others, or they feel that the work is arduous and they are tired of it. In addition, some cadres have blind optimism and impatience. They think that the task will be completed as soon as the abacus rings, and they are unwilling to do arduous work. They have opinions on the farmers in their townships and villages who did not sell their surplus grain well last year, and they feel that there is no way to deal with them, and the task is arduous, so they are impatient. Some people ask the leaders for solutions, saying that they want to rectify these people when they go back. All of these, if not overcome, will directly affect this year's grain unified purchase. Therefore, the responsibility of Party and government leading organs at all levels is to timely unblock the various thoughts existing among Party members, League members, and cadres, help them solve the difficulties in their work, support them, and give them working methods. In addition to appropriately criticizing the shortcomings in the past work that belong to the cadres, all those that belong to the leaders should be borne by the leaders and should not be held responsible for them, so that they can carry out the work happily. Only in this way can we further overcome and defeat the difficulties that may occur in the unified purchase work.
    This year's grain unified purchase work is very arduous, and the time is very tight. It is carried out in conjunction with autumn requisition, unified sales, and other work. According to the experience in last year's unified purchase work, to do these tasks well, we must mobilize the whole Party and go all out to ensure the completion of the task and avoid or minimize deviations. Therefore, this year, we must also mobilize the strength of the whole Party, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, transfer a large number of cadres, go deep into districts and townships to conduct inspections and assist in the work, and timely solve the problems found in the unified purchase, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's grain unified purchase task.

### 贯彻多购余粮的方针，争取超额完成粮食统购任务

    贯彻多购余粮的方针，争取超额完成粮食统购任务
    大规模的秋季粮食征收和统购工作在全国范围内开始了。当前的中心问题，是根据需要和可能、结合当地实际情况，努力贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针，争取完成和超额完成今年度粮食统购的任务。
    大家知道，明年是我们国家第一个五年建设计划的第三年，许多大的建设工程都要动工，城市、工矿区的人口势必继续增加。国家提倡增产棉花和油料作物，不生产粮食的农民也将要增加，这都要求国家有更多的粮食供应他们的需要。今年我国部分地区遭受了水灾，国家根据这些地区的灾情轻重，要减购粮食或免购粮食，而且对受灾过重的农民，还要拿出大批粮食救济他们和卖给他们。所有这一切，都说明国家和人民对粮食的需要量是增大了的。
    但是，我国目前还十分缺乏足够的粮食储备和社会储备，这就迫切要求国家掌握必要的储备。这不仅因为我国当前的粮食生产主要力量还是很不稳定的小农经济，我们还不可能完全避免自然灾害的袭击，如果没有足够的粮食储备，就不能保证国家的社会主义工业化事业的顺利进行。因此，国家在粮食政策中，除了必须征收一定数量的农业税以外，就必须贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针，在今年贯彻这个方针，在今后若干年内还必须继续贯彻这个方针。
    贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针不仅是必要的，并且是可能的。今年全国除长江、淮河两岸和其他部分地区受灾减产以外，占全国耕地面积百分之九十以上的非灾区都已丰收。据初步估计，全国粮食总产量比去年有所增加；但国家今年征粮和购粮的任务，比去年征粮和购粮的实数增加不多。这就是说，今年粮食产量增加的多，而国家征粮购粮数目增加的小。在粮食增产的基础上，适当地多购一些余粮，应该说是完全可能的。
    最近几年以来，由于国家实行奖励农业生产的政策，由于连续几年的丰收，上年度国家超计划百分之十四点六完成粮食收购计划。在超额完成国家购粮计划之后，除掉农民口粮、种籽、饲料以外，农村中还有一部分余粮。在今年的三至五月的三个月内，农民在国家领导的农村粮食市场自动出售的余粮就有四十亿斤左右，说明了农村中仍然是有余粮的。因此，今年在留下农民的口粮和必需的饲料、种籽以外，国家多购一些余粮也是可能的。
    今年统购粮食，存在着许多有利的条件。首先，各级党委和人民政府的领导机关和广大干部，经过上年度的粮食统购统销，已经对农村粮食的产、消、余、缺的情况有了大体上的了解，并在工作中逐步积累了一些经验，这对于我们正确贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针，必会发生极大的作用。其次，广大农民普遍地受到了过渡时期总任务的教育，社会主义觉悟有了很大的提高，粮食统购统销实行以后农村中发生的巨大变化，生动地教育了广大农民，使他们真正认识到国家和个人、工业和农业、目前利益和长远利益的正确关系。一年以来，许多农民从粮食价格稳定、各种物价稳定、售粮储蓄等方面得到巨大的实际利益，农民已经特别看得清楚，由于粮食统购统销的实行，因而在今年水灾如此严重的情况下，灾区不但供应得到保证，而且粮价仍很平稳，所以河北灾区人民说国家的粮食统购统销政策是救命政策，这不是偶然的。因此，今年农民多卖余粮的热情是很高的。这是今年统购粮食中的积极、有利的因素。只要我们认真做好思想动员工作，充分发扬这些有利的因素，那末，尽量多购余粮的方针是完全能够顺利贯彻的。
    有些人以为国家尽量多购余粮的方针和统购政策有矛盾。这是不正确的。当然，在小农经济的状况下，要把产量、消费量、饲料等情况完全摸清楚是很困难的，因而使任务和政策在实际工作中达到一致是一个艰巨的工作；但经过切实的调查研究和反复的宣传教育，大体上摸清产量、消费量、饲料等情况是可能的；如果再注意到统购以后在农村还留有一部分余粮的情况，那末就应该相信使任务同政策一致起来是完全可能的。因此，认为任务和政策有矛盾的看法是不对的，它会使我们在执行中不肯艰苦地切实地去进行许多实际工作。要知道，国家的粮食统购政策，就是统购农民的余粮的政策，因此，尽量多向农民购买扣除口粮、种籽、饲料和一部分机动粮以外所留下的余粮，正是进一步贯彻了国家的粮食统购政策。
    此外，我们还应该看到由于小农经济的特点，有一部分农民为了生产和生活的需要还要进行调剂性和周转性的售粮。这部分粮食，除掉在国家粮食市场出售以外，在一定的时间他们还要求国家收购，否则他们便无法进行生产和生活的周转。在这种情况下，国家为了解决他们的困难是应该收购的。但是绝不能满足于这种收购，不能靠收购这种粮食来完成统购任务，因为这样做会过多地收购了周转性、调剂性的粮食，而农村的余粮则收购不足，结果便会使销售季节中的销售数字大大增加，而富农将乘机扰乱市场进行投机，助长农村资本主义和自发势力的发展，使我们陷于被动。这是必须十分警惕的。
    为了更好地贯彻多购余粮的方针，各地对于分配的任务，一定要充分发扬民主，反复进行讨论，贯彻实事求是的精神，使任务更加符合余粮的实际情况。我们必须反对单纯任务观点和硬性摊派任务的作法，那是完全违反购粮政策的。
    为了正确贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针，当前的重要任务，就是在开过县、区、乡的三级干部会议以后，当统购任务布置到广大农村时，首先认真开好乡村党员干部和积极分子会议。要通过这些会议，把国家尽量多购余粮的方针、意义和贯彻这个方针的工作方式方法，向他们反复交代清楚，提高他们的政治觉悟和政策水平，这是完成和超额完成粮食统购任务的保证。广大农村党员干部是粮食统购政策的具体执行者，是农民群众的直接带路人，且多数就有余粮。他们绝大多数是当地人，和家庭、亲友有着广泛的联系。他们只要对国家尽量多购余粮方针有了正确的认识，觉悟水平和政策水平有了提高，就能首先带头和动员亲友报实产量，按照国家的规定卖出余粮，这就可以带动广大农民群众踊跃地售出余粮。因此，打通党员、团员、干部的思想是完成粮食统购任务的关键。
    但是，我们绝不要低估了工作上的艰苦性和复杂性，也绝不要认为工作中就没有困难了。从最近某些三级干部会议所反映的情况看，正是因为干部是关键，所以今年的工作是十分艰苦十分复杂而又有很多新的困难的。这主要的是有些干部不能切实报出自己的和本区、本乡、本村的产量。有不少干部有畏难情绪，他们或则工作里曾经发生过毛病，曾经受过批评；或则怕得罪群众；或则（主要是青年积极分子）在家庭中不能做主，去年受过家庭的气，以致不敢带头，怕别人讥讽；或者觉得工作艰苦，发生厌倦情绪。另外有些干部有盲目乐观和急躁情绪，他们认为算盘珠一响就完成任务，不愿作艰苦工作。他们对本乡本村去年余粮未很好卖出来的农民有意见，觉得没有办法对付，而任务又艰巨，因此急躁，有些人向领导上要办法，表示回去要整一整这些人。所有这些，如果不加克服就会直接影响今年的粮食统购。因此，各级党政领导机关的责任就在于及时地打通党员、团员、干部中所存在的各种思想，帮助他们解决工作中的困难，撑他们的腰，给他们以工作的办法。过去工作上的缺点，除掉属于干部的必须适当批评以外，凡是属于领导上的应由领导上担当下来，不应要他们负责，使他们愉快地去进行工作。只有这样才能进一步克服和战胜统购工作中可能发生的困难。
    今年的粮食统购工作是十分艰巨的，时间是十分紧迫的。它同秋征、统销等其他工作结合进行。根据去年统购工作中的经验，要做好这些工作，必须全党动员，全力以赴，才能保证完成任务，不出或少出偏差。因此，今年还必须动员全党力量，在各级党委统一领导下，抽调大批干部，深入区、乡，进行检查和帮助工作，及时解决统购中发现的问题，为争取完成和超额完成今年的粮食统购任务而努力。
