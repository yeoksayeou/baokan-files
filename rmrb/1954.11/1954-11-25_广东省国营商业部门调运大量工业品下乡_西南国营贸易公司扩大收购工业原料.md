    Guangdong State-Owned Commercial Departments Transfer Large Quantities of Industrial Goods to the Countryside
    Southwest State-Owned Trading Companies Expand Purchase of Industrial Raw Materials
    The fourth quarter is the season for Guangdong Province to comprehensively implement the unified purchase of grain and the large-scale purchase of agricultural products. State-owned commercial departments have prepared a large amount of industrial products to supply the countryside in coordination with this work. The supply of commodities organized by the state-owned commercial system throughout the province in the fourth quarter will increase by more than 60% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the supply of undershirts and trousers, cotton sweaters and trousers, as well as towels and socks needed by farmers has more than doubled. More than 10,000 tons of goods were shipped from Guangzhou to various parts of the province in October and early November. Now, large quantities of industrial products are still being transferred down to the countryside.
    The Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce dispatched more than 600 cadres from provincial-level state-owned commercial departments to the countryside in mid-November to assist the work of local commercial departments. After arriving in various places, the work teams dispatched by the Department of Commerce will assist local state-owned commercial departments, closely rely on supply and marketing cooperatives, and utilize private retailers and peddlers to do a good job in promoting industrial products, actively purchase agricultural and sideline products, and ensure the completion of the fourth quarter's commodity circulation plan.

    State-owned trading companies in various parts of the Southwest have expanded their purchases of industrial raw materials. In the third quarter of this year, state-owned trading companies purchased more than 79,000 dan of several major industrial raw materials such as hemp, ramie, Chinese gall, raw lacquer, white wax, and sulfur, an increase compared with the same period last year. The fourth quarter purchase plan is more than 138% larger than the same period last year.
    Various parts of the Southwest produce many kinds of industrial raw materials, with more than 50 kinds such as Chinese gall and white wax having relatively large yields. Many of these industrial raw materials can be exported. This year, except for some industrial raw materials that suffered rain damage and reduced production, most industrial raw materials have increased production compared with previous years. In addition to direct purchases, state-owned trading companies have also signed agency purchase contracts with cooperatives in various places to facilitate farmers' sales. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省国营商业部门调运大量工业品下乡
    西南国营贸易公司扩大收购工业原料
    第四季度是广东省全面进行粮食统购和大量收购农产品的季节，国营商业部门为配合这一工作已准备了大量工业品供应农村。全省国营商业系统第四季度组织供应的商品将比去年同期增加百分之六十以上。其中农民需要的卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤以及毛巾和袜子等的供应量都增加一倍以上。十月份和十一月上旬从广州运往全省各地的商品有一万多吨。现在每天仍有大量工业品源源下调。
    广东省人民政府商业厅本月中旬从省级国营商业部门调派六百多干部下乡协助各地商业部门工作。商业厅派出的工作队到达各地后，将协助各地国营商业部门，紧密依靠供销合作社并利用私营零售商和小贩，做好工业品的推销工作，积极收购农产品和副产品，保证完成第四季度的商品流转计划。 （新华社）
    西南各地国营贸易公司扩大收购工业原料。今年第三季度国营贸易公司收购的大麻、苎麻、五棓子、生漆、白蜡和硫磺等几种主要工业原料，比去年同期增加七万九千多担，第四季度收购计划比去年同期扩大百分之一百三十八以上。
    西南各地出产许多种工业原料，产量比较多的有五棓子和白蜡等五十多种。其中有许多工业原料可供输出。今年除部分工业原料遭受雨水损害减产外，大多数工业原料都比往年增产。国营贸易公司除直接收购外，并和各地合作社签订了代购合同，便利农民出售。　（新华社）
