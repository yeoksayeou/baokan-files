    Accepting the Lesson of Blind Glauber's Salt Production

    In August of this year, this newspaper received a letter from Zhao Fulin of the Huaibei Salt Industry Trade Union Propaganda Department, reflecting that last winter, the Huaibei Saltworks assigned the Daipu Institute salt workers the task of producing 3,300 dan of Glauber's salt. The salt workers, recognizing that Glauber's salt had great industrial uses, tried to overcome all difficulties despite lacking experience in its production and overfulfilled the manufacturing of the new product. However, after the Glauber's salt was produced, it was left idle for several months. Despite repeated reports from the salt workers and leading cadres of the Daipu Institute to higher authorities, requesting the Glauber's salt be transferred out as soon as possible, there was still no news of the transfer by August. Over the months, due to wind and rain, more than 2,500 dan of this rush-produced Glauber's salt has been lost. The Huaibei Salt Administration admits that this matter is true. The administration, when arranging the task, had serious bureaucratic work styles, wrongly estimated the market situation, and thus blindly determined the task of producing 300,000 dan of Glauber's salt. After the task was assigned, no technical guidance was provided, and the produced Glauber's salt was mostly substandard, resulting in no sales except for more than 100,000 dan that had already been allocated to Guanghua Chemical Plant. After a long period of wind and rain, about 6,000 dan of this Glauber's salt has been damaged (worth 11,000 yuan per dan). Now the Huaibei Saltworks has accepted this lesson, has concentrated the Glauber's salt scattered and stored under the dikes to strengthen its preservation, and has screened out the mud from the poorer quality Glauber's salt, preparing to find a way to sell it all.

    接受盲目生产芒硝的教训
    今年八月，本报接到淮北盐业工会宣传部赵福林来信反映：去年冬季，淮北盐场分配了大浦所盐工产制芒硝三千三百担的任务，盐工们因为认识到芒硝在工业上有很大用途，虽然没有制硝经验，也设法战胜了一切困难，超额完成了新产品的制造。可是，芒硝制成后，一搁就是几个月，虽经盐工们和大浦所领导干部一再向上级反映，要求早日把芒硝拨运出去，但直到八月份还是没有拨运芒硝的消息。几月来，由于风吹雨打，这批赶制出来的芒硝已经损失两千五百担以上。淮北盐务管理局承认这一事情是确实的，管理局在布置任务时，存在着严重的官僚主义作风，错误的估计市场情况，因而就盲目地确定生产三十万担芒硝的任务。任务分配下去后，又没有进行技术指导，生产出来的芒硝多不合规格，结果除了已经拨交给光华化工厂十多万担外，其余的都找不到销路。经过长时期的风吹雨打，这批芒硝已经损耗六千担左右（每担价值一万一千元）。现在淮北盐场已经接受这个教训，对分散堆存圩下的芒硝，已经集中起来加强保管；对质量较差的芒硝，已筛去泥块，准备设法全部卖出。
