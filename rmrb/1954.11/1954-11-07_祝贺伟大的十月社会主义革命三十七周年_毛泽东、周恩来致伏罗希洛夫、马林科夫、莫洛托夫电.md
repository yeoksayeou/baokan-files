    Congratulations on the 37th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution
    Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai's Telegram to Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Molotov
To Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
To Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
To Comrade Molotov, First Vice-Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:

    On the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to you and, through you, to the great Soviet people and the Soviet government.

    For thirty-seven years, the glorious achievements of the great Soviet people in building a communist society have played an immeasurable role in promoting human progress and safeguarding world peace. Progressive people all over the world are jubilant over the historic victory of the Soviet people and regard the great Soviet Union as a beacon on the road ahead.

    In recent years, the forces defending peace throughout the world, headed by the Soviet Union, have become increasingly strong and developed. More and more people are in favor of peaceful coexistence. War conspiracies to revive German militarism and Japanese militarism are constantly being resolutely opposed by the German people, the Japanese people, and the people of all countries. The struggle against the establishment of aggressive military blocs, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and for universal disarmament is unfolding universally. All this makes us believe that as long as the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persevere in this cause to the end, world peace can be maintained and consolidated.

    The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is playing an increasingly significant role in promoting the common prosperity of the two countries and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. Recent talks between the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev and the Chinese government mark a new development in the great friendship between the two peoples and once again demonstrate the unanimous aspirations and common interests of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union. This friendship will accelerate the socialist construction of the Chinese people and promote the further consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world.

    Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
    November 6, 1954, in Beijing

    祝贺伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年
    毛泽东、周恩来致伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫、莫洛托夫电苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席马林科夫同志：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫同志
    值此伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年之际，我们代表中国人民和中国政府谨向你们并通过你们向伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    三十七年来，伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义社会的事业中所获得的辉煌成就，对于促进人类进步和维护世界和平起了不可估量的作用。全世界进步人类为苏联人民所取得的历史性胜利而欢欣鼓舞，并把伟大苏联当作前进道路上的灯塔。
    最近几年来，以苏联为首的全世界保卫和平的力量日益强大和发展。赞成和平共处的人越来越多。复活德国军国主义和日本军国主义的战争阴谋不断遭受德国人民、日本人民和各国人民的坚决反对。反对建立侵略性的军事集团，要求禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，以及普遍裁减军备的斗争正在普遍展开。这一切使我们相信，只要各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，世界和平就能够保持和巩固。
    中苏两国的伟大同盟对促进两国的共同繁荣和维护远东与世界和平事业日益明显地发挥着极其巨大的作用。最近以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团与中国政府的会谈，标志着两国人民伟大友谊的新发展，并再一次表现了中苏八亿人民的一致愿望和共同利益。这种友谊将加速中国人民的社会主义建设和促进远东及世界和平的更加巩固。
    伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中苏两国永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国主席  毛泽东
    中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长　周恩来
    一九五四年十一月六日于北京
