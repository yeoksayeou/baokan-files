    Greeting the 37th Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Workers in People's Democratic Countries Launch Production Emulation Drives
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] Workers in Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria are greeting the upcoming 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with new labor achievements.
    The Polish coal mining industry has achieved great success in the emulation campaign to greet the October Revolution Day. Nearly sixty mines across the country have exceeded their October production plans. Miners in various places have collectively overproduced more than 300,000 tons of coal in October. Many mines' workers have participated in work shifts dedicated to greeting the October Revolution Day. In the steel industry, workers in steel factories such as "Peace," "Bobrek," and "Kosciuszko" are realizing the emulation pledges made for the October Revolution Day: overproducing hundreds of tons of steel. In the textile industry, the Marchlewski Textile Factory and the "People's Army" Textile Factory in Łódź alone have had more than four thousand employees participate in greeting-the-holiday work shifts in recent days, and they are striving to fulfill their pledge to increase production by tens of thousands of meters of fabric.
    Hungarian textile workers, metalworkers, shipbuilders, and food industry workers are launching production emulation drives. Employees of many industrial enterprises began their greeting-the-holiday work shifts on November 1st. In recent days, news of workers successfully fulfilling their emulation pledges has been constantly pouring in from various places. Oil workers in Zalaegerszeg have overproduced more than 740 tons of liquid fuel for the country. Workers at the Lepte Lak cheese factory exceeded their October plan by producing ten carloads of cheese. Workers at the Budafok Enamelware Factory overproduced a large number of enamelware items.
    Employees of various industrial enterprises in Romania are also successively fulfilling their emulation pledges. In the wave of emulation to greet the holiday, employees of seventy industrial enterprises in the Ploiești region have completed and exceeded their production plans for the first ten months of this year. Oil workers at the Țîrgoviște oil field and workers at the Valia Călugărească sulfuric acid factory recently exceeded their production plans by 500 tons of oil and 2,500 tons of chemical fertilizer, respectively. In addition, workers at the "Kirov" boot factory have saved enough leather to make six hundred pairs of shoes in the emulation campaign.
    The achievements of the emulation campaign in various industrial enterprises in Bulgaria are also remarkable. In the competition, many textile workers have already begun working on the 1955 plan.
