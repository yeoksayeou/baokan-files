    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：最近曾到中国访问的日本左派社会党中央执行委员会主席铃木茂三郎、外交局长佐多忠隆，十月二十七日向左派社会党在东京的国会议员报告他们的访华情况。二十九日，日本左派社会党外交局举行会议，作出决定，确认中国是和平力量，不进行侵略。会议作出的另一项决定说，日本左派社会党要努力恢复日本同中国的邦交。
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：日本国会议员访华团的右派社会党议员，在十月二十八日提出了一份详细的访华报告。报告主张日本应该和中国缔结和约和一项互不侵犯条约。报告并在序言中说：中国并无任何侵略日本的意图，因为那个国家正在集中力量进行和平建设。报告的序言还说：中国的政权越来越巩固。中国的重工业已有许多发展，并且在不久的将来，日本便会有一个强大的工业国家——中国作为它的邻邦。所以，日本对于恢复和中国的关系问题，特别是贸易关系问题，不应采取一种毫不在乎的态度。
