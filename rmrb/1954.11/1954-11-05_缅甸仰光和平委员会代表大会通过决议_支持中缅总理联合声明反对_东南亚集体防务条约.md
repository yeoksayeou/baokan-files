Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 4th—The Representatives' Congress of the Rangoon Peace Committee of Burma was held in the Rangoon City Hall from October 27th to 29th. Over 200 people attended the congress, including representatives from various district branches of the Rangoon Peace Committee, various strata, various people's organizations, as well as well-known Burmese peace activists and heads of peace organizations from various parts of Burma.

    Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, Chairman of the Burmese Council for World Peace, presided over the opening ceremony.

    The three-day congress discussed and adopted the work report on the peace movement in Rangoon County, elected a new executive committee of the Rangoon Peace Committee composed of 28 members including U Swe Pru, and passed resolutions opposing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and supporting the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, and supporting the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    The work report on the peace movement in Rangoon County praised the Five Principles in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, considering them to be the road to peace in Asia and the world. The report denounced the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," considering it to be the United States' deliberate interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries and its maintenance of tension in Asia.

    After the closing of the Congress, the Rangoon Peace Committee also held a mass rally to convey the resolutions of the Congress. These resolutions were unanimously supported by the people who attended the mass rally.
