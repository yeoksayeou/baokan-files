    Commemorating the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Publication of "The Peasant Question in France and Germany"

    Engels' "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," written in 1894, is an important Marxist-Leninist document on the peasant question.
    The peasant question is the question of the working class's revolutionary allies. In the struggle to seize power, the working class must attract the broad masses of peasants to its side and guide them to carry out the revolution together in order to guarantee the victory of the revolution. In the process of building socialism, the working class must lead the peasants, the most numerous class of working people, onto the path of socialism. Only after agriculture, an important but backward economic sector, has undergone socialist transformation can the overall victory of socialist construction be reliably guaranteed.
    The great teachers of the working class, Marx and Engels, never forgot the peasants while leading the working class in its struggle for liberation. Marx once pointed out that the working class revolution must be supported by peasant uprisings. Without this support, "the proletarian revolution's solo performance in all peasant countries would become a dirge." [1] He also pointed out that not only did the working class need the help of the peasants, but the peasants also needed the help of the working class. "Only the downfall of capital can elevate the peasants; only the anti-capitalist government of the proletariat can break the peasants' economic poverty and social degradation" [2].
    Since the peasant question is "the question of the proletariat's allies in the struggle for power" [3], it will be more urgently placed on the historical agenda for concrete resolution only when the working class's seizure of power has become a matter of the near future. Engels' article "The Peasant Question in France and Germany" appeared under such historical conditions.
    The uprising of the French working class in 1871 and the Paris Commune formed after the uprising were the first great attempts by the working class to seize power. Although the heroic attempt of the Paris Commune failed, it left a valuable lesson: the working class must form an alliance with the broad masses of poor peasants in order to achieve the victory of the revolution and maintain that victory. "The Paris Commune opened up the road to realize this alliance for itself, but failed to achieve its goal due to many internal and external reasons." "Without this alliance, democracy is not stable, and socialist transformation cannot be realized" [4].
    So, how should the working class approach the peasants? What kind of appeals can the working class put forward to attract the peasants from the influence of the bourgeoisie? After the working class seizes power, what path should it follow to guide the peasants towards socialism? These were the questions that the workers' parties of Europe had to solve at that time.
    The land program put forward by the French Socialist Party in 1892, as well as the theoretical arguments for this land program, did not correctly solve the above problems. In order to correct the erroneous principles in the French Socialist Party's land program, Engels wrote "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," which was published in the "New Era" magazine in 1894.
    In "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," Engels first pointed out that "peasants are a very important element of the population, production, and political power." In order to prevent the urban and rural bourgeoisie from using lies to "arouse the peasants' suspicion and hatred of socialist workers," and in order to seize power, the working-class party "should first go from the city to the countryside and become a force in the countryside." Engels' outstanding contribution was the use of the Marxist method of class analysis to analyze the class composition of the rural population and its development laws in France and Germany at that time, thereby providing a scientific basis for the working class's correct policy towards the peasants.
    According to land ownership, management, and exploitation relationships, Engels pointed out that rural residents mainly included the following classes: small peasants (i.e., middle peasants), large peasants (i.e., rich peasants), poor peasants, and rural workers. In France, Belgium, and western Germany at that time, small peasants accounted for the vast majority of the rural population. Therefore, "among all the peasants, the small peasant type is the most important, and not only for Western Europe in general." Therefore, the attitude of the working-class party towards the peasants should first be based on its attitude towards the small peasants.
    Engels demonstrated the law that the small peasant economy is bound to perish under capitalist conditions. Taking the changes in the status of peasants before and after the French bourgeois revolution as an example, he pointed out that although the bourgeois revolution freed the peasants from feudal shackles, it immediately put capitalist shackles on them. The economic situation of the peasants is deteriorating day by day. "Taxes, crop failures, family divisions by inheritance, and lawsuits drive the peasants one by one towards usurers; debt is becoming more and more common and more and more burdensome for everyone -- in short, our small peasants, like any residue of an outdated mode of production, are inevitably heading towards destruction. They are the future proletarians."
    What future should the working-class party point out to the increasingly divided and dying small peasants? What slogans should be used to attract the small peasants to its side?
    The French Socialist Party made incorrect answers in its land program. The French Socialist Party regarded the small peasants' pitiful desire to maintain a small piece of land in order to avoid their own destruction under capitalist conditions as the fundamental interest of the peasants. They catered to the small peasants' deep-rooted concept of private ownership, and even believed that after the working class seized power, the small peasants' land private ownership could be maintained perpetually.
    Engels severely criticized this distorted interpretation of Marxism, and creatively put forward the theory and policy of agricultural collectivization.
    Engels pointed out that what socialism requires is that producers control the means of production, not to protect the private land of small peasants and hand over the means of production to individual possession, but to hand over the means of production to the collective possession of producers. Engels argued that producers "can only control the means of production in two forms: either in the form of individual control, which, as a common phenomenon of all producers, has never existed at any time or any place, and is being eliminated day by day by the progress of industry; or in the form of collective control, whose material and spiritual prerequisites have been created by the development of capitalist society itself."
    In this way, Engels, based on the law that the relations of production must be compatible with the nature of the productive forces, scientifically explained that the working-class party can only "put forward the collective ownership of the means of production as the only main goal to be strived for. This is not only the case in industry, where the foundation has already been laid, but also everywhere, that is, in agriculture." The way to realize the collective ownership of the means of production in agriculture is through the path of collectivization, so that the "private production and private ownership of small peasants are transformed into cooperative production and cooperative ownership."
    This path is completely in line with the vital interests of the peasants. Engels wrote: "If you try to protect the small peasants from private property, you are not protecting their freedom, but only protecting a special form of their slavery; this is prolonging their state of being unable to live or die." Only by overthrowing the capitalist system together with the working class can the peasants "unfold a completely different future."
    Engels pointed out that the working-class party must never deceive the peasants with false promises. "It is not in our interest to attract the peasants to our side today in order to let them leave us tomorrow when we cannot fulfill our promises." The working-class party must honestly explain to the peasants that the working class cannot help the peasants avoid bankruptcy and destruction under capitalist conditions. Only after the peasants overthrow the capitalist system together with the working class can they be freed from the backward and poor status of small producers forever with the help of the working-class regime. In this way, the peasants "will understand more and more that even if we promise less and seek salvation in a completely different direction, we are still more reliable people."
    One of Engels' outstanding contributions was to point out in this paper that in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, the principle of voluntariness must be adhered to, and the methods of persuasion, demonstration, and social assistance must be adopted. Engels wrote: "When we have seized state power, we cannot imagine depriving the small peasants by force (whether or not there is compensation is irrelevant), as we have to do with the large landowners. Our task for the small peasants is first of all to transform their private production and private ownership into cooperative production and cooperative ownership, but not by means of coercion, but by providing examples and suggesting social assistance to achieve this goal. At that time, we will of course have sufficient funds to make the small peasants understand the benefits that they should have understood now." Engels taught: "We firmly stand on the side of the small peasants; we will do everything possible to make their fate better, and if they are determined, to make it easier for them to transition to cooperatives, and if they are not yet determined, to give them some time to consider on their own small land."
    While teaching the working class that it must be patient with the small peasants, Engels also pointed out that it must treat the large landowners without hesitation. "Once our party seizes state power, it should simply expropriate the large landowners, just like the industrial factory owners... We will transfer the large territories returned to society in this way, under social supervision, to the rural workers organized into cooperatives who are already cultivating these territories for use." Engels pointed out that the rural proletariat is the most revolutionary class in the countryside, and the working-class party must sow the seeds of socialism among them and attract them to engage in revolutionary struggles.
    In summary, it can be seen that Engels, in his paper "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," had already given principled instructions on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture. These valuable instructions could have greatly helped the development of the European working-class revolutionary movement.
    However, Engels passed away the year after "The Peasant Question in France and Germany" was published. The instructions of Marx and Engels on the peasant question were not valued by the opportunist parties of the Second International. The opportunists of the Second International did not want to lead the working class to seize power and did not believe in the dictatorship of the proletariat, so they would not care about the question of the working class's allies in the revolution.
    Under the historical conditions of imperialism, Lenin revived and developed the ideas of Marx and Engels on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture, and led the Russian working class and peasants to overthrow the rule of the landlords and the bourgeoisie.
    Lenin believed that in the bourgeois revolution, the Russian proletariat should unite with all the peasants to isolate the bourgeoisie in order to overthrow the Tsar and the landlord class. During the socialist revolution, the proletariat should unite with the poor peasants, neutralize the middle peasants, and oppose urban and rural capitalism. In the period of socialist construction after the proletariat seized power, it should rely on the poor and middle peasants to form agreements, and never stop the struggle against the rich peasants. Lenin emphasized that the dictatorship of the proletariat, as a powerful tool for building a socialist society, is a special alliance between the proletariat and the petty-bourgeois laboring masses, especially the peasant laboring masses. Lenin completely stipulated the specific path of gradually guiding the basic masses of peasants to the track of socialist construction through cooperatives. He believed that the cooperative system is an important tool for the dictatorship of the proletariat to transform the small peasant economy and educate the basic masses of peasants in the spirit of socialism.
    After Lenin's death, Stalin continued to develop the theory of the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture. He believed that the socialist transformation of Soviet agriculture was in a more favorable condition than the socialist transformation of Western agriculture discussed by Engels. Soviet peasants were accustomed to political cooperation with the proletariat in the three revolutions, and they gained freedom because of this cooperation, which would promote the economic cooperation between the Soviet working class and the peasants.
    Stalin stipulated and implemented in practice the theory of agricultural collectivization. He elaborated on the specific form of collective farms, demonstrated the policy of restricting rich peasants to eliminating rich peasants, and revealed the significance of agricultural machinery stations for the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    According to the principles of Marx and Engels on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the complete theory of agricultural collectivization of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet peasants to successfully realize agricultural collectivization, and for the first time in human history established advanced socialist large-scale agriculture, thereby laying the foundation for the overall victory of socialism in the Soviet Union.
    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements of socialist construction have once again confirmed the correctness of the principles of Marx and Engels on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, peasants had particularly great significance for the new democratic revolution. After the new democratic revolution, peasants were also a social force worthy of special attention in socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The overthrow of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries mainly depends on the strength of these two classes. From new democracy to socialism, we mainly rely on the alliance of these two classes" [5].
    The Chinese worker-peasant alliance has its own characteristics. In the new democratic revolution, the Chinese Communist Party's policy in the countryside was to rely on the poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction. In the period of transition to socialism, the Chinese Communist Party's policy in the countryside was to rely on the poor peasants (including the new middle peasants), consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, and gradually move from restricting the exploitation of rich peasants to finally eliminating the exploitation of rich peasants.
    The specific path of socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture also has several special features. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been widely developed. The Chinese Communist Party, based on the Marxist-Leninist principles on the socialist transformation of agriculture and summarizing the experience of agricultural production cooperation in our country, stipulated the specific path for further carrying out agricultural collectivization on the basis of private land ownership, that is to say, it is necessary to go through simple temporary mutual aid teams of common labor and permanent mutual aid teams with certain divisions of labor and specialization on the basis of common labor and with certain small amounts of public property, to agricultural production cooperatives with land shares, unified management, and more public property, to more advanced agricultural production cooperatives (that is, collective farms) with completely socialist collective peasant public ownership.
    In the past five years, China's agricultural collectivization has achieved brilliant achievements. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country will definitely be fully realized.
    At a time when the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country is progressing smoothly, deeply understanding Engels' principles on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture is of great practical significance to us.

    纪念“法德农民问题”发表六十周年
    蒋学模
    恩格斯在一八九四年写的“法德农民问题”，是马克思列宁主义关于农民问题的一个重要文献。
    农民问题是工人阶级的革命同盟军问题。在夺取政权的斗争中，工人阶级必须把广大的农民基本群众吸引到自己周围来，引导他们一道去进行革命，才能保证革命的胜利。在建设社会主义的过程中，工人阶级必须把农民这一人数最多的劳动者阶级引上社会主义的道路，只有在农业这一重要而落后的经济部门得到社会主义改造后，社会主义建设的全面胜利也才有可靠的保证。
    工人阶级伟大的导师马克思和恩格斯在领导工人阶级为自己的解放而斗争当中，一刻也没有忘记农民。马克思曾经指出，工人阶级的革命必须获得农民起义的支持，假如没有这种支持，“那末，在一切农民国度中无产阶级的革命底独唱，就会变成哀歌。”〔一〕他也指出，不仅工人阶级需要农民的帮助，农民也需要工人阶级的帮助。“只有资本底倒台，才能提高农民；只有无产者的反资本主义的政府，才能打破农民底经济的贫乏和社会的堕落”〔二〕。
    农民问题既然是“无产阶级在为政权而斗争中的同盟者问题”〔三〕，因此，只有当工人阶级夺取政权已成为最近将来的事情的时候，它才会被更迫切地提到历史日程上来要求具体的解决。恩格斯的“法德农民问题”一文，便是在这样的历史条件下出现的。
    一八七一年法国工人阶级的起义和起义后组成的巴黎公社，是工人阶级夺取政权的第一次伟大的尝试。巴黎公社的英勇尝试虽然失败了，但它留下一个宝贵的经验，那就是：工人阶级要取得革命的胜利和保持这个胜利，就必须与广大的贫苦农民结成联盟。“巴黎公社曾为自己开辟过实现这个联盟的道路，但由于许多内外原因而没有达到目的。”“而没有这个联盟，则民主制就不稳固，社会主义改造就不可能实现”〔四〕。
    那么，工人阶级究竟怎样去接近农民呢？工人阶级究竟可以提出怎样的号召把农民从资产阶级的影响下吸引过来呢？工人阶级在取得政权以后，究竟循着怎样的道路引导农民走向社会主义呢？这些就是当时欧洲各国工人阶级政党必须解决的问题。
    法国社会党一八九二年所提出的土地纲领以及对这一土地纲领的理论论证，并没有能够正确地解决上述这些问题。为了纠正法国社会党的土地纲领中错误的原则，恩格斯写了这一篇“法德农民问题”刊登在一八九四年的“新时代”杂志上。
    恩格斯在“法德农民问题”中首先指出“农民是人口、生产和政治力量底非常重要的要素”，为了不让城乡资产阶级用谎言“挑起农民对社会主义工人的怀疑和憎恨”，为了夺取政权，工人阶级的政党就“应当首先从城市走到乡村，应当成为乡村中的力量”。恩格斯的杰出贡献，是用马克思主义的阶级分析方法，分析了法国和德国当时农村人口的阶级构成及其发展规律，从而为工人阶级对农民的正确政策，提供了科学的基础。
    恩格斯根据土地占有、经营情况和剥削关系，指出农村居民中主要包括着这样几个阶层：小农
  （即中农）、大农（即富农）、贫农和农村工人。在当时的法国、比利时和德国西部，小农占着农村人口中的绝大多数，因此，“在所有的农民当中，小农这一类型是最重要的，而且不仅对于一般西欧才是如此”。所以工人阶级政党对待农民的态度，首先应当以对待小农的态度作为出发点。
    恩格斯论证了小农经济在资本主义条件下必然灭亡的规律。他以法国资产阶级革命前后农民地位的变化为例，指出资产阶级革命虽然为农民解除了封建束缚，但立刻又给农民带上一副资本主义的铐镣。农民在经济方面是每况愈下，“捐税、歉收、遗产继承者之分家、诉讼，将农民一个又一个地驱向高利贷者；负债是一天天地普遍起来，而且对于每个人是一天天地更加沉重，——总之，我们的小农，正如任何过了时的生产方式底残余一样，不可避免地走向着灭亡。他是将来的无产者。”
    工人阶级政党给日益分化并走向灭亡的小农指出怎样的前途，用什么口号把小农吸引到自己周围来呢？
    法国社会党在土地纲领中做出了不正确的答案。法国社会党把小农在资本主义条件下为避免自己灭亡而拼命想保持一小块土地的可怜愿望，当作农民的根本利益。他们迁就小农这种根深柢固的私有观念，甚至认为在工人阶级掌握政权以后，小农的土地私有制也能永恒不变地保持下去。
    恩格斯严厉地批判了这种歪曲马克思主义的说法，并创造地提出了农业合作化的理论和方针。
    恩格斯指出，社会主义所要求的由生产者掌握生产资料，并不是保护小农私有土地，把生产资料交给个人占有，而是要把生产资料交给生产者集体占有。恩格斯论证说，生产者“掌握生产资料仅能有两种形式，——或者是个人掌握底形式，这一形式作为一切生产者共同的现象，无论任何时候和任何地方都未有过，而且它一天天地被工业的进步所排除着；或者是集体掌握底形式，这一形式底物质的和精神的前提已经被资本主义社会底发展本身所造成了。”
    这样，恩格斯就根据生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则，科学地说明了工人阶级的政党，只能把生产资料的集体占有“提出来作为必须争取的唯一的主要目标。这不仅在基础已经打好了的工业方面是如此，而且在所有的地方，也就是说，在农业方面也是如此”。而农业方面生产资料集体所有制产生的途径，便是通过合作化的道路，使小农“私人的生产和私人的所有权变为协作社的生产和协作社的所有权”。
    这一条道路与农民的切身利益是完全符合的。恩格斯写道：“你们企图从私有财产中保护小农，这不是保护他的自由，而仅仅是保护他的奴隶身份底特殊形式而已；这是延长他的求生不成求死不得的状况”。农民只有跟工人阶级一同来推翻资本主义制度，小农面前才能“展开完全不同的前途”。
    恩格斯指出，工人阶级的政党决不能用虚伪的诺言去欺骗农民。“我们的利益决不在于今天就把农民吸引到自己这方面来，以便当我们不能实现自己的诺言时，让他们明天再离开我们。”工人阶级的政党必须向农民老老实实地说明，工人阶级并不能帮助农民在资本主义条件下避免破产和灭亡，农民只有跟工人阶级一道推翻了资本主义制度之后，才能在工人阶级政权的帮助之下永远摆脱小生产者落后与贫穷的地位。这样，农民“就会一天比一天更加懂得：纵然我们许诺的少，完全从另外一个方向去寻找解救，但我们毕竟是一些更加可靠的人”。
    恩格斯的杰出贡献之一，是在这篇论文中指出了在农业的社会主义改造的过程中必须坚持自愿的原则和采取说服、示范和社会帮助的方法。恩格斯写道：“当我们掌握了国家政权的时候，我们根本不能设想用暴力去剥夺小农（有无赔偿是无关重要的），就像我们对于大土地占有者所不得不作的一样。我们对于小农的任务首先是在于：将其私人的生产和私人的所有权变为协作社的生产和协作社的所有权，但决不是使用强迫的手段，而是凭借提供范例和建议社会帮助以达到这一目的。那时候我们当然会有足够的资力，使小农懂得他们现在本来就应该懂得的好处。”恩格斯教导说：“我们是坚决地站在小农方面的；我们将尽一切可能使他们的命运较好些，如果他们下决心的话，就使他们易于过渡到协作社，如果他们还下不了决心的话，就给他们一些时间，让他们在自己的零细土地上考虑一下。”
    恩格斯在教导工人阶级必须耐心地对待小农的时候，同时指出必须毫不客气地对待大地主。“我们的党一掌握了国家政权，它就应该干脆地剥夺大土地占有者，就像剥夺工业厂主一样。……我们要把这样归还给社会的大领地，在社会监督之下，转交给组织到协作社中的而现在已经在这些领地上耕作的农村工人使用。”恩格斯指出，农村无产者是农村中最革命的阶级，工人阶级的政党必须在他们中间撒下社会主义的种子，吸引他们来从事革命斗争。
    综上所述，可知恩格斯在“法德农民问题”这篇论文中，已经对工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造作出了原则性的指示。这些宝贵的指示，本来是可以大大帮助欧洲工人阶级革命运动的发展的。
    但恩格斯在“法德农民问题”发表后的第二年便逝世了。马克思和恩格斯关于农民问题的指示，并没有受到第二国际机会主义政党的重视。第二国际机会主义者是不想引导工人阶级去夺取政权，不相信无产阶级专政的，因而也就不会去关心工人阶级在革命中的同盟军问题。
    在帝国主义的历史条件下，列宁复活了和发展了马克思和恩格斯关于工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造的思想，并领导俄国工人阶级和农民起来推翻地主和资产阶级的统治。
    列宁认为，在资产阶级革命中，俄国无产阶级应该联合全体农民，使资产阶级陷于孤立，以便打倒沙皇和地主阶级。在社会主义革命时期中，无产阶级应该联合贫农、中立中农，反对城乡资本主义。在无产阶级夺取政权以后的社会主义建设时期，应该依靠贫农和中农成立协定，一分钟也不停止反对富农的斗争。列宁着重指出，作为建立社会主义社会的有力工具的无产阶级专政是无产阶级与小资产阶级劳动群众，首先是农民劳动群众的特殊联盟。列宁完整地规定了那种经过合作社逐步引导农民基本群众到社会主义建设轨道上去的具体道路。他认为合作制是无产阶级专政用来改造小农经济和以社会主义精神来教育农民基本群众的重要工具。
    在列宁逝世以后，斯大林继续发挥了工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造的理论。他认为，比起恩格斯所论述的西方农业的社会主义改造来说，苏联农业的社会主义改造具备更有利的条件。苏联农民在三次革命中惯于和无产阶级实行政治合作，并因这种合作而获得自由，这是会促成苏联工人阶级和农民的经济合作的。
    斯大林规定了并在实践上执行了农业集体化的理论。他阐明了集体农庄的具体形式，论证了从限制富农到消灭富农的政策，揭示了农业机器站对农业的社会主义改造的意义。
    根据马克思和恩格斯关于工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造的原理和列宁、斯大林的农业合作化的完整理论，苏联共产党领导苏联农民胜利地实现了农业合作化，在人类历史上第一次建立了先进的社会主义大农业，从而奠定了社会主义在苏联的全面胜利。
    中国人民革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就，又一次证实了马克思和恩格斯关于工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造原理的正确性。在半殖民地半封建的中国，农民对新民主主义革命具有特别重大的意义。在新民主主义革命后，农民在社会主义建设中也是一种值得特别重视的社会力量。毛泽东同志说：“推翻帝国主义与国民党反动派，主要是这两个阶级的力量。由新民主主义到社会主义，主要依靠这两个阶级的联盟”〔五〕。
    中国的工农联盟具有自己的特点。在新民主主义革命中，中国共产党在农村中的政策是依靠贫农、团结中农、有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度。在向社会主义过渡的时期，中国共产党在农村中的政策，是依靠贫农（包括新中农在内）、巩固地团结中农，逐步地由限制富农剥削到最后消灭富农剥削。
    中国农业的社会主义改造的具体道路，也有若干特殊地方。在中华人民共和国成立后，互助合作运动得到广泛的发展。中国共产党又根据马克思列宁主义关于农业的社会主义改造的原理，总结我国农业生产合作的经验，规定了在土地私有制基础上进一步开展农业合作化的具体道路，这就是说，要经过简单的共同劳动的临时互助组和在共同劳动的基础上实行某些分工分业而有某些少量公共财产的常年互助组，到实行土地入股、统一经营而有较多公共财产的农业生产合作社，到实行完全的社会主义的集体农民公有制的更高级的农业生产合作社（也就是集体农庄）。
    这五年来，我国的农业合作化已获得了辉煌的成就。我们相信，在中国共产党的领导下，我国农业的社会主义改造是一定能够完全实现的。
    正当我国农业的社会主义改造顺利进行的时候，深入体会恩格斯的关于工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造的原理，对我们是具有重大的现实意义的。
