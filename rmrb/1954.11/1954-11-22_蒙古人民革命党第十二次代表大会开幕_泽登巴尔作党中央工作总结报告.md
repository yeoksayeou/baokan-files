Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, November 20th: According to TASS, the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party opened in Ulan Bator on November 19th. More than 630 delegates attended the meeting, representing laboring herdsmen, the working class, and intellectuals. In addition, there were many guests – representatives from fraternal communist and workers' parties.

Tsedenbal, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party as the first item on the agenda. At the beginning of his report, Tsedenbal emphasized the growth of the strength of the democratic and socialist camp. He said that the friendship, alliance, and mutual support of our countries are a vivid embodiment of the principles of proletarian internationalism, and they help us victoriously solve the tasks we face. The victory of Soviet communist construction, the achievements of the People's Republic of China and other people's democracies, and the common struggle of democratic countries for peace and friendship among nations have a tremendous impact on the entire course of historical development. The historically rooted and rigorously tested sacred friendship between Mongolia and the Soviet Union has been and continues to be an inexhaustible source, from which the Mongolian people, revived by the revolution, have been drawing vitality to strive for the victory of the motherland's prosperity.

The period since the 11th Congress of the Party has been characterized by further consolidation of the internal situation in the Mongolian People's Republic, the people's democratic regime has been stabilized, and the national economy and culture have been developed. Thanks to the correct leadership and constant care of the Party and the government, with the full fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the material welfare and cultural level of our people have continuously increased, and their political consciousness and creative initiative have continuously improved. The victories achieved by the Mongolian People's Republic in building the foundations of socialism vividly demonstrate the enormous vitality and consolidation of our country and the growing strength of our people's democratic system.

The main sector of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic is animal husbandry. Our Party and government are very concerned and strive to develop animal husbandry and increase the productivity of livestock products. The state has taken a series of measures to further increase the number of livestock of individual herdsmen, herdsmen's production cooperatives, and state-owned ranches. During the first five-year plan period, the number of livestock in the Republic increased by 8.7 percent.

The policy of the Party and the government is: while developing and consolidating the socialist component of agriculture and animal husbandry, at the same time fully support and develop the economy of laboring herdsmen, and restrict and exclude capitalist factors. In implementing its policies, the Party relies on poor herdsmen and strives to consolidate the alliance with middle herdsmen, who constitute the vast majority of rural residents.

In the past period, the socialist component in agriculture, such as herdsmen's production cooperatives, state-owned ranches, and horse-breeding and grass-cutting stations, has achieved great development. The number of herdsmen's production cooperatives increased to twice that of 1948 in 1954, and the number of members tripled.

Tsedenbal emphasized that, in addition to herdsmen's production cooperatives, the socialist transformation of agriculture also stipulates that hundreds of thousands of herdsmen's lives be transformed into a settled form, and development is necessary for establishing a solid feed base.

In his report, Comrade Tsedenbal paid special attention to the development of industry, transportation, and post and telecommunications in the Mongolian People's Republic. He said that with the help of the Soviet Union, a number of new enterprises have been built, including the mining industry equipped with the latest Soviet machinery. The Naushki-Ulan Bator railway, built by the Soviet Union with money and effort, is of extremely important significance to the economy of the Mongolian People's Republic. According to the agreement concluded between the governments of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, a railway from Jining to Ulan Bator will be built, and this railway will be open to traffic in 1955.

The outstanding result of industrial development is the growth of the domestic working class. In the past seven years, the number of factory workers has doubled. Thanks to the care of the Party and the government, the material and cultural living standards of the working people have continuously improved. In 1954, the real wages of employees have increased by 46 percent compared with 1947. As a result of the measures taken in recent times, the direct benefits obtained by herdsmen this year are more than 100 million Tugriks (Mongolian currency). Much work has also been done in health care and national education. Illiteracy among adult residents has been completely eliminated. The number of secondary schools in the country has increased fivefold compared to 1947.

Tsedenbal said that the strength of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party lies in its unbreakable close ties with the broad masses; in its use of Marxist-Leninist theory as a guide to action and reliance on the rich experience and multifaceted assistance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In conclusion, Tsedenbal pointed out in his report that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party faces major tasks: to further develop the economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, especially the main sector—animal husbandry, to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and to develop a culture of national form and socialist content. He said that under the leadership of the long-tested People's Revolutionary Party, and with the growing great fraternal assistance of the powerful Soviet Union, our people will gloriously complete the work plan formulated by the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

The meeting then heard the report of the Inspection Commission.

    蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会开幕
    泽登巴尔作党中央工作总结报告
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社乌兰巴托二十日讯：蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会十一月十九日在乌兰巴托开幕。出席会议的有六百三十余名代表，他们是劳动牧民、工人阶级和知识分子的代表，此外还有许多来宾——各兄弟共产党和工人党派来的代表。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会政治局委员泽登巴尔就第一项议程作了蒙古人民革命党中央委员会的总结报告。泽登巴尔报告的开头着重指出了民主、社会主义阵营力量的增长。他说，我们这些国家的友谊、同盟和互相支持是无产阶级国际主义原则的活生生的体现，它们帮助我们胜利地解决我们面临的任务。苏联共产主义建设的胜利，中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的成就以及民主国家争取和平和各国人民的友谊的共同斗争，对整个历史发展的过程有着巨大的影响。蒙苏两国之间有着历史渊源的、经过严格考验的神圣的友谊，过去和现在一直是一个无穷无尽的源泉，为革命所复兴的蒙古人民一直从这里汲取活力，来争取祖国繁荣的胜利。
    在党的第十一次代表大会以后这段时期的特点是，蒙古人民共和国内部的局势有了进一步的巩固，人民民主政权已经稳固，国民经济和文化得到了发展。由于党和政府在苏联全面的兄弟援助下实行了正确的领导和经常的关怀，我国人民的物质福利和文化水平不断增长，他们的政治觉悟和创造积极性不断提高。蒙古人民共和国在建设社会主义基础方面所获得的胜利，鲜明地证明了我国的巨大的生命力和巩固性，证明了我国人民民主制度不断增长着的力量。
    蒙古人民共和国国民经济的主要部门是畜牧业。我们的党和政府非常关怀尽力发展畜牧业和提高牲畜产品生产率。国家采取了一系列的措施来进一步增加个体牧民、牧民生产合作社和国营牧场的牲畜头数。在第一个五年计划期间，共和国内牲畜头数增加了百分之八点七。
    党和政府的政策是：在发展和巩固农牧业的社会主义成分的情况下，同时全面地支持和发展劳动牧民经济，限制和排挤资本主义因素。党在执行自己的政策时依靠贫苦的牧民，尽力巩固与占乡村居民绝大多数的中等牧民的联盟。
    在过去时期内，牧民生产合作社、国营牧场和牧马割草站等农业中的社会主义成分取得了大大的发展。牧民生产合作社的数目在一九五四年增为一九四八年的两倍，而社员的人数增为三倍。
    泽登巴尔着重说，农业的社会主义改造，除了牧民生产合作社以外，还规定把几十万牧民生活转变为定居的形式，并发展为建立巩固的饲料基地所必要的农业。
    泽登巴尔同志在他的报告中，特别重视蒙古人民共和国的工业、运输业和邮电事业的发展。他说，在苏联的帮助下，建造了好些新的企业，其中包括用苏联最新的机器装备的采矿工业。由苏联出钱出力建筑的纳乌什基—乌兰巴托铁路，对于蒙古人民共和国的经济有着极其重大的意义。依照蒙古人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国三国政府之间缔结的协定，将修建一条从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路，这条铁路将在一九五五年通车。
   工业发展的卓越成果就是国内工人阶级的成长。过去七年中，工厂工人的人数已增加了一倍。由于党和政府的关怀，劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平不断提高。一九五四年职工的实际工资已比一九四七年增加了百分之四十六。由于最近时期所采取的措施的结果，牧民今年获得的直接利益就在一亿图格里克（蒙币）以上。在保健事业和国民教育事业方面也进行了许多工作。成年居民中的文盲已完全消除。国内的中等学校数目增为一九四七年的五倍。
    泽登巴尔说，蒙古人民革命党的力量在于和广大群众牢不可破的紧密联系；在于它以马克思—列宁主义的理论作为行动的指南并依靠苏联共产党的丰富经验和多方面的帮助。
    泽登巴尔在报告中最后指出，蒙古人民革命党面前摆着重大的任务：进一步发展蒙古人民共和国的经济，特别是主要部门——畜牧业，进行农业的社会主义改造和发展民族形式和社会主义内容的文化。他说，我国人民在久经考验的人民革命党的领导下，在强大的苏联的越来越增长的、伟大的兄弟般的援助下，将光荣地完成蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会所拟定的工作计划。
    会议接着听取了检查委员会的报告。
