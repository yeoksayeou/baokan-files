    East China Region's Grain and Cotton Production Exceeds Last Year
    This year, the East China region has experienced a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. The total grain output of the entire region is expected to surpass that of last year. The average yield per unit area of cotton is projected to increase by more than 11% compared to last year, and the total output may approach or reach the state plan.
    This year, some areas of East China suffered unprecedented, severe flooding. The areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, which are high-yield grain-producing regions, were the most severely affected. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the support of the people across the country, the farmers in the disaster areas relied on the strength of organization to finally overcome the floods, rapidly reducing the affected area and greatly mitigating the disaster. In the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu Province, where most crops were lost during the 1931 floods, the Huai River project played a significant role this year, resulting in a large-scale bumper harvest of 12 million mu of rice. In the areas east of the Grand Canal in Gaoyou and Baoying counties, the total rice output exceeded any year since liberation, and the rice output in Xinghua County exceeded the original plan by more than 5 million jin. The Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province, which was once severely affected by waterlogging, still maintained a per-unit area yield of early autumn crops close to last year's level after draining the accumulated water and strengthening field management.
    Farmers in the vast lightly affected and non-disaster areas adopted methods such as utilizing autumn fallow land, expanding the area of replanting, and cultivating regenerating crops to over-produce grain and cotton and compensate for the losses suffered by the disaster areas. Anhui Province cultivated more than 7 million mu of regenerating rice, which can yield 300 million jin of grain. After strengthening field management and other tasks, the farmers in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong Province, are expected to overfulfill the plan for more than 2.3 million mu of cotton, with an estimated average yield of approximately 43 jin of unginned cotton per mu, exceeding the original plan by five to six jin.

    华东区粮食棉花产量超过去年
    今年华东区粮食和棉花丰收。全区粮食的总产量，预计可以超过去年；棉花的平均单位面积产量，预计比去年增加百分之十一多，总产量可以接近或达到国家计划。
    今年华东部分地区遭受百年来未有的特大洪水侵袭。长江和淮河两岸粮食高产量地区，受灾最重。灾区农民在党和政府领导下，在全国人民支援下，依靠组织起来的力量，终于战胜洪水，使灾区受灾面积迅速缩小，灾情大大减轻。在一九三一年洪水时大部庄稼颗粒无收的江苏省北部里下河地区，今年治淮工程发挥了巨大作用，一千二百万亩水稻得到大面积丰收；高邮、宝应等县运河以东地区，水稻总产量超过解放后任何一年，兴化县水稻产量超过原定计划五百多万斤。一度曾受严重内涝的安徽省淮北平原，经排除积水、加强田间管理，二千二百多万亩早秋作物的单位面积产量，仍接近去年水平。
    广大轻灾区和非灾区的农民采取利用秋闲地、扩大复种面积、培植再生作物等办法，超额增产粮棉、弥补灾区所受的损失。安徽全省培植了七百多万亩再生稻，可以收获三亿斤粮食。山东省惠民专区农民在加强田间管理等工作之后，二百三十多万亩棉花可以超额完成计划，每亩棉田预计平均产皮棉四十三斤左右，超过原计划五、六斤。（新华社）
