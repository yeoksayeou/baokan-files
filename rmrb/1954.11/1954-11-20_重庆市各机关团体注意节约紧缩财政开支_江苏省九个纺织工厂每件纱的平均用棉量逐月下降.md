Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th: Chongqing's municipal organs and groups are paying attention to saving and tightening expenditures. Preliminary calculations indicate that they can save the state over 27 billion yuan by the end of this year. The savings items in various organs all pertain to matters that are optional or can be postponed. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau originally requested a subsidy of 26 billion yuan based on its planned operating expenses. After careful budgeting, it reduced non-urgent items such as dormitory construction and equipment purchases. Not only did it no longer require a subsidy, but it also saved 1.8 billion yuan. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau reduced tax expenses by more than 830 million yuan by using existing tax receipts and certificates instead of reprinting them. In addition, it devised various methods to save over 130 million yuan in official expenses.

Many units have opened up sources of savings by improving their work. The Municipal People's Government Health Bureau urged its affiliated medical institutions to collect outstanding fees and strictly controlled appropriations. Relief institutions under the Civil Affairs Bureau actively implemented the principle of production for self-relief, increasing income. Some organs also conducted a reallocation of unused inventory materials, which also reduced a considerable amount of financial expenditure.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th: The average cotton consumption per yarn piece in nine textile factories in Jiangsu Province, including the local state-owned Nanjing Yarn Factory and the jointly owned state-private Nantong Dasheng Textile Company, decreased month by month from 392.8 jin in the first quarter of this year to 387.92 jin in October. Among them, the second factory of the jointly owned state-private Dasheng Textile Company used only 383.92 jin of cotton per yarn piece in the third quarter. Calculated according to the cotton allocation standard of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, this factory saved more than 124,000 jin of raw cotton from January to September.

The quality of cotton yarn in these factories has also improved. The quality of 20-count yarn increased from 76 points in June to 80 points in August. In September, the quality of 14 out of 19 yarn counts improved compared to August. Factory No. 1 of Dasheng Textile Company recently promoted "single-line trial spinning," and the quality of cotton yarn reached the first-class standard, and the cotton consumption was also reduced. The Jiangsu Provincial Textile Industry Administration is preparing to promote this experience.

    重庆市各机关团体注意节约紧缩财政开支
    江苏省九个纺织工厂每件纱的平均用棉量逐月下降
    【新华社重庆十八日电】重庆市各机关、团体注意节约，紧缩开支，初步计算到今年年底可为国家节约二百七十多亿元。各机关节约的项目都是属于可办可不办或可缓办的事情。重庆市人民政府教育局照原来事业费开支的计划要求补助二十六亿元，经过精打细算以后，缩减了不急需的宿舍修建、设备购置等项，不但不再要求补助，还可节约十八亿元。重庆市人民政府税务局利用旧有税票证，不再重新印制等办法，减少了税务费八亿三千多万元，另外还想了各种办法节约公务费一亿三千多万元。
    许多单位从改进工作方面增辟了节约的源泉。市人民政府卫生局督促所属各医疗机构收清了欠费，并严格控制拨款。民政局所属救济机构积极执行生产自救的原则，增加了收入。有的机关还把不使用的库存物资相互进行了一次调拨，也减少了不少财政开支。
    【新华社南京十八日电】江苏省地方国营南京纱厂和公私合营南通大生纺织公司等九个纺织工厂平均每件纱的用棉量，从今年第一季度的三百九十二点八斤逐月下降到十月份的三百八十七点九二斤。其中公私合营大生纺织公司副厂第三季度每件纱只用棉三百八十三点九二斤。按照中国花纱布公司配棉标准计算，这个厂一月到九月共节约原棉十二万四千多斤。
    这些工厂的棉纱质量也提高了。二十支纱从六月份的七十六分逐月提高到八月份的八十分。九月份，十九种纱支中又有十四种纱支的质量比八月份提高。大生纺织公司一厂最近推行“一条线试纺”，棉纱质量达到甲级标准，用棉量也降低了。江苏省纺织工业管理局已准备推广这个经验。
