Zhejiang Coastal Fishermen Prepare to Set Sail
    Fishermen in coastal Zhejiang Province and the Zhoushan Islands are actively preparing to go to sea to catch hairtail. The province plans to produce more than 160 million catties this winter, an increase of 14 percent over last winter's total output.
    This year, more than half of the fishermen in coastal areas of Zhejiang Province have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and the number of fishermen and fishing boats going to sea will increase compared with previous years. Communist Party organizations and people's governments at all levels are very concerned about the winter fishing production of fishermen. Eleven of the sixteen important fishing counties along the coast have established leading departments for fishery production, and navigation marks and storm warning stations have been established in major fishing areas to strengthen safety equipment for going to sea for fishing. In order to help fishermen add and repair fishing boats and fishing nets, the state has allocated tens of billions of yuan in loans to major fishing areas. More than 840 new fishing boats have been built in the province. In addition, the supply of rice, edible oil, fishing nets, ramie, and other production and living necessities to fishermen is also adequately prepared. (Xinhua News Agency)

    浙江省沿海渔民准备出海
    浙江省沿海和舟山群岛渔民正积极准备下海捕捉带鱼。全省计划今冬产量为一亿六千多万斤，总产量将比去冬增加百分之十四。
    今年浙江省沿海地区渔民已有半数以上参加互助合作组织，下海渔民、渔船都将比往年增多。各地共产党组织和人民政府非常关心渔民的冬汛生产。沿海十六个重要渔业县已有十一个县设立了渔业生产的领导部门，主要渔区都建立了航标和暴风警报站，加强了出海捕鱼的安全设备。为帮助渔民添置和修补渔船、渔网，国家拨给主要渔区的贷款有数十亿元。全省新造渔船八百四十多只。此外，供应给渔民的大米、食油、渔网、络麻等生产和生活必需品，也准备得充足。（新华社）
