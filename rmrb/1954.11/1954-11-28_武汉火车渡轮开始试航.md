The large train ferry manufactured by the state-owned Jiangnan Shipyard for the Zhengzhou Railway Administration to support the north-south train crossing of the Yangtze River in Wuhan was launched at the end of September this year. After a month and a half of intense work by the shipyard's workers, it has now been fully completed and officially began its trial voyage on November 23rd. This large ferry was designed and manufactured by the shipyard itself. It is 105 meters long, 10.7 meters wide, has a draft of 1.6 meters, and a displacement of 1,760 tons. This ferry can carry sixteen fully loaded train cars (arranged in two rows). Its entire structure is constructed using a combination of steel plates, rivets, and electric welding, giving it a strong resistance to wind and waves. It can normally navigate in winds up to force six. This ferry will soon sail to Wuhan to transport north-south trains across the river between Wuchang and Hankou. Before the Yangtze River Bridge is open to traffic, it will serve as a bridge connecting materials between the north and south of our country. (Our Shanghai Correspondent Station)

    武汉火车渡轮开始试航
    国营江南造船厂为支援武汉南北火车过江，为郑州铁路管理局制造的火车过江大渡轮在今年九月底下水后，经过该厂职工一个半月来的紧张工作，现已全部完工；并在十一月二十三日正式试航。这艘大渡轮是该厂自行设计和制造的，它的身长一百零五公尺，宽十点七公尺，吃水一点六公尺，船的吨位是一千七百六十吨。这只渡轮可载运满装货物的火车车皮十六节（分两行排列）。它的全部结构都是采用钢板、铆钉、电焊混合法建造的，抗拒风浪能力很强，一般在六级风浪下可正常航行。这只渡轮不久即将开往武汉，在武昌汉口之间运输南北火车过渡。在长江大桥通车以前，它将是沟通我国南北物资的桥梁。  （本报上海记者站）
