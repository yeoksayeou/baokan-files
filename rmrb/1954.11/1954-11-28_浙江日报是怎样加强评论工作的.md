	Zhejiang Daily is How to Strengthen Commentary Work
	Gao Guang
	Strengthening commentary work is an extremely important aspect of improving newspaper content. National newspapers should, of course, regularly publish commentaries with a high level of ideological and political awareness on major domestic and international issues, in accordance with the Party's general line and various policies and resolutions; local newspapers should also gradually aim to publish correct commentaries on various important issues in local practical life and work on a regular basis. Only by conscientiously strengthening commentary work can newspapers improve their ideological and combative nature, better play the role of the Party's mouthpiece, and further strengthen ties with the masses.
	Zhejiang Daily began to pay attention to strengthening commentary work in January of this year. In the previous two or three years, commentary work was one of the weakest links in Zhejiang Daily. Although the editorial department also recognized that commentary is the most important form of newspaper propaganda for Marxism-Leninism, propagating the Party's policies, and guiding practical work, it had a mentality of relying on the Party committee in its guiding ideology, lacked initiative and planning for commentary work, rarely discussed commentary work when discussing propaganda tasks, and rarely formulated systematic commentary plans. As a result, the newspaper's commentary work actually fell into a state of laissez-faire, becoming irregular, unbalanced, and unable to promptly and systematically raise the urgent issues in the lives of the masses and practical work to the level of theory and policy principles for discussion. For example, in the first half of 1953, only 47 commentaries of various forms were published (including 12 editorials), averaging less than eight per month. And among the published commentaries, important aspects such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, supply and marketing cooperatives, fisheries, handicrafts, cadre study, school education, and municipal construction were completely untouched. Many important and urgent issues in social life needed the newspaper to speak out, but the newspaper remained silent, a situation that clearly could not meet the needs of the broad masses of readers. Therefore, many readers criticized the newspaper: "There are too few comments in the newspaper." "Zhejiang Daily is a big reporter, and a big reporter should look like a big reporter."
	The criticism from the broad masses of readers became the driving force for the newspaper to improve its work. After vigorously publicizing the Party's general line in the winter of 1953, the Zhejiang Daily editorial department, under the specific leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, studied how to strengthen commentary work. In the first quarter of this year, a relatively comprehensive and systematic commentary plan was formulated, a strong team of internal and external writers was organized, and everything from the editor-in-chief's office to the various groups took the initiative to strive to complete the plan, and supplemented and revised the plan according to the needs of real life. By persisting in this way, some initial results have been achieved. Taking the situation in the first half of this year as an example, the number of commentaries has greatly increased compared with the past, and has begun to develop in the direction of regularity and balance. In the first half of this year, 183 commentaries of various forms were published (including 33 editorials), averaging one commentary per day. Those items on which the newspaper did not publish commentaries in the first half of 1953 have all published commentaries this year, and many commentaries have been published on some important items. For example, more than 20 articles were published on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in the first half of this year. The strengthening of commentary work is not only reflected in the increase in the number of commentaries, but also in the newspaper's ability to systematically organize commentaries around the current central work and major tasks. The commentaries on rural work have been done relatively well in this regard. In the first half of this year, the newspaper published 16 editorials on rural work based on the leadership intentions of the Party committee and the actual work situation. The main contents of these editorials were: during the publicity of the general line and grain purchase, production can and must be done well at the same time; continue to deeply publicize the general line and improve the production enthusiasm of farmers; patiently educate middle peasants; guide the enthusiasm of the peasant masses to the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation; summarize and promote advanced agricultural production experience, and strive for large-scale production increase; carry out fertilizer accumulation movement to create conditions for striving for agricultural bumper harvest; resolutely implement the policy of "active leadership and steady progress" to ensure the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; conscientiously run state-owned farms; do a good job in rural economic work to support spring plowing production; attach importance to the development of animal husbandry, and mobilize the masses to solve the problem of feed; preventing natural disasters is the central key to striving for a comprehensive agricultural harvest; improve and improve this year's agricultural loan work; conscientiously cultivate agricultural labor models to educate the vast number of farmers to take the socialist road with living examples; actively develop credit cooperation, etc. In addition, a series of commentaries, short commentaries and other forms of commentaries were published on many specific issues surrounding the development of mutual aid and cooperation movement, the promotion of advanced production technology and the prevention and control of natural disasters, and economic work serving spring plowing production. These commentaries on the one hand deepened the influence of the editorials, on the other hand, they were concrete elaborations and supplements to the editorials.
	With the strengthening of commentary work, the guiding role of newspapers in practical work has also been strengthened. For example, in the early stage of publicizing the general line and grain purchase, Zhejiang Daily introduced the experience of basic point townships and published editorials in coordination, and rural work cadres in various places reflected: "With concrete experience and theoretical basis, it is of great help." For example, during the publicity of grain purchase, many areas neglected the leadership of current production, and even squeezed out production work, and some cadres suspected whether production work could be carried out at the same time as grain purchase work. In response to this situation, the newspaper published editorials such as "Winter Production Can and Must Be Done Well at the Same Time During the Publicity of the General Line and Grain Purchase" and "Continue to Deepen the Publicity of the General Line to Improve Farmers' Production Enthusiasm," criticizing the tendency of "putting on the hat of production" and actually neglecting production, so that the cadres who were originally skeptical corrected their understanding and attached importance to doing a good job in production work. For example, when the winter water conservancy work in Zhuji County was in full swing, the deputy county magistrate of Zhuji County immediately convened agricultural and forestry cadres for special research after seeing the newspaper, and notified various districts to promote the development of water conservancy work in the whole county. With the strengthening of commentary work, the connection between newspapers and the masses has also been strengthened. Many readers, especially rural work cadres, reflected: "Reading the commentary of Zhejiang Daily, you can know the intention of the provincial party committee." "We didn't pay attention to some work before, but we paid attention to it when the party newspaper mentioned it." Many county and district cadres carry newspapers with important commentaries with them, learning and doing at the same time.
	The initial improvement of Zhejiang Daily's commentary work is inseparable from the Party committee's strengthening of leadership over this work. During this period, in addition to personally writing editorials for the newspaper, the responsible comrades of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee also gave the editorial department commentary topics, specifically instructed the key points of the commentary, and vigorously organized the newspaper's commentary. Most of the above-mentioned 16 editorials on rural work were written by the provincial party committee with specific contents and entrusted to the newspaper and various departments. The Provincial Party Committee also entrusted the responsible comrades of the Rural Work Department to convene a special meeting, absorbing comrades from the Provincial People's Government Agriculture and Forestry Department, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, People's Bank, Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, Youth League, Women's Federation and other relevant units to study the newspaper's commentary plan for a certain period. The Provincial Finance Committee also held a similar meeting. After the specific instructions of the Party Committee and the joint research of various relevant departments, the newspaper's commentary plan can be formulated more comprehensively and perfectly. Such a commentary plan not only guides the newspaper's commentary work, but also guides the newspaper's entire propaganda activities, and becomes the newspaper's propaganda program in a certain period.
	Of course, the strengthening of Zhejiang Daily's commentary work is also the result of the editorial department's increased awareness of commentary work, overcoming the idea of simply relying on the Party committee and business departments, and giving play to its initiative and enthusiasm. During this period, the editorial department regularly formulated the newspaper's commentary plan on the basis of paying attention to studying the Party committee's intentions and actual work situation, and strived to make the plan comprehensive and balanced, focusing on both the central tasks and the urgent problems in the lives of the masses, and taking into account general work, as far as possible to make the commentary adapt to all aspects of social life. The leading comrades of the editorial department regarded the formulation of the commentary plan and the inspection and supervision of the completion of the commentary plan as a regular and major task of their own. In order to ensure the implementation of the commentary plan, the editorial department vigorously launched and organized the writing force inside and outside the newspaper. Originally, the comrades inside the newspaper and the responsible comrades of the Party committee and government business departments all had a fear of writing commentaries, especially editorials, thinking that this was speaking on behalf of the Party committee, with high requirements and unable to write. In order to overcome this fear, Zhejiang Daily first started from the inside, mobilized the writing force inside the newspaper, and the leading comrades of the editorial department took the lead in writing more, and gradually expanded to group leaders and editors. When the comrades began to write commentaries, the leaders took the initiative to propose topics and main contents, and patiently helped to revise them. These commentaries were adopted and received good feedback from readers, and everyone's confidence and enthusiasm in writing commentaries also increased day by day. Taking the Rural Group as an example, the comrades of this group only wrote five or six commentaries in the first half of 1953, while the more than 60 commentaries on rural work published in the newspaper in the first half of this year were mostly written by themselves. In the process of mobilizing the internal writing force, it is more important to improve everyone's policy and ideological level and writing ability. In this regard, the editorial department has done some work (although not often enough): timely conveying relevant policy instructions and organizing learning; inviting responsible comrades from Party and government leading organs to come to the newspaper to make policy reports; studying the actual situation and policy issues every week with the reporting group as a unit, and determining the topics and contents of the commentary based on the results of the research; conducting organized spare-time language learning; using methods such as "article hospital" and "newspaper inspection" to improve shortcomings in writing; and specially summarizing and checking the writing work of commentaries. While mobilizing the internal forces, Zhejiang Daily also began to pay attention to organizing the external writing forces. As the number of commentaries published in the newspaper increased, the editorial department also planned to invite responsible comrades from various departments to write articles, and the enthusiasm of various departments to write commentaries gradually increased. For example, the Provincial Party Committee Rural Work Department, the Provincial People's Government Agriculture and Forestry Department and other units took the initiative to write commentaries for the newspaper to guide work through the newspaper. The experience of Zhejiang Daily in organizing a commentary writing team shows that as long as the editorial department pays attention to helping everyone improve their understanding of the Party's principles and policies, improve their ability to investigate and study the actual situation, and improve their writing ability in the process of practice, and is good at mobilizing them to write according to the specialties of the comrades of various business departments, the potential power of writing commentaries inside and outside the newspaper can be gradually brought into play.
	Zhejiang Daily's work to strengthen commentary has just begun. Although it has achieved some initial results, there are also some problems. First, the planning of the commentary is not thorough enough, and the themes of the commentary are not diversified enough. Currently, the commentary on ideological work is the weakest. The commentary work on industrial production, basic construction, etc. is also weak. Secondly, the quality of the commentary is not high. Some commentaries still have shortcomings such as generalization and lack of persuasiveness. Again, most of the sources of commentary topics are formulated according to the intentions of the leaders; as for how the editorial department actively discovers problems from in-depth research into actual life and writes commentaries, it has not done enough. These shortcomings still need to be gradually overcome by the Zhejiang Daily editorial department by strengthening the connection with reality and the masses. Only by overcoming these shortcomings can we adhere to the regularization of commentary and continuously improve the quality of commentary, and better play the role of the Party newspaper as the Party's powerful assistant.

     浙江日报是怎样加强评论工作的
    高光
    加强评论工作是改进报纸内容的一个极其重要的方面。全国性的报纸固然应当根据党的总路线和各项政策、决议，对于国内和国际发生的重大问题经常发表具有高度思想政治水平的评论；地方的报纸也应当逐步做到对于当地实际生活和工作中的各种重要问题经常发表正确的评论。只有认真地加强评论工作，报纸才能够提高思想性和战斗性，才能更好地发挥党的喉舌的作用，并进一步密切同群众的联系。
    浙江日报是从今年一月份开始注意加强评论工作的。在这以前的两三年中，评论工作是浙江日报最薄弱的环节之一。编辑部虽然也承认评论是报纸宣传马克思列宁主义、宣传党的政策和指导实际工作的最重要的形式，但在领导思想上却存在着依赖党委的情绪，对评论工作缺乏主动性和计划性，在讨论宣传任务时很少讨论评论工作，也很少制订有系统的评论计划。这样，报纸的评论工作实际上陷于自流状态，不经常，不平衡，不能及时地系统地把群众生活和实际工作中的迫切问题提到理论和政策原则的高度来加以论述。像一九五三年上半年只发表了各种形式的评论四十七篇（其中社论十二篇），平均每个月不到八篇。而在所发表的评论中，对于抗美援朝、农业生产互助合作、供销合作、渔业、手工业、干部学习、学校教育、市政建设等重要方面则完全没有涉及。社会生活中许多重要的和迫切的问题需要报纸发言，但报纸却一言不发，这种情况显然是不能满足广大读者要求的。因此，许多读者向报纸提出了批评：“报纸的言论太少了。”“浙江日报是大报告员，大报告员就要有大报告员的样子。”
    广大读者的批评，成了推动报纸改进工作的动力。一九五三年冬季开始大张旗鼓地宣传党的总路线以后，浙江日报编辑部在中共浙江省委的具体领导下，研究了如何加强评论工作。今年第一季度，制订了比较全面、系统的评论计划，大力组织了社内外的作者队伍，从总编辑办公室到各组都发挥了主动性，努力完成计划，并根据现实生活的需要，补充和修正了计划。这样坚持下来，已经初步收到一些效果。拿今年上半年的情况来说，评论的数量较前大大增加，并且开始向着经常、平衡的方向发展。今年上半年发表了各种形式的评论一百八十三篇（其中社论三十三篇），平均每一天有一篇评论。一九五三年上半年报纸没有发表评论的那些项目，今年都发表了评论，而且对有的重要项目发表的评论很多。如对农业生产互助合作，今年上半年就发表了二十多篇。评论工作的加强不仅表现在评论数量的增加上，而且表现在报纸能够围绕当前的中心工作和重大任务，开始做到有系统地组织评论。在这方面做得比较好的是关于农村工作的评论。今年上半年，报纸就曾根据党委领导意图和实际工作情况，对农村工作发表了十六篇社论。这些社论的主要内容是：在宣传总路线和购粮期间，可以也必须同时搞好生产；继续深入进行总路线宣传，提高农民的生产积极性；耐心地教育中农；把农民群众的积极性引向以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动；总结和推广先进农业生产经验，争取大面积增产；开展积肥运动，为争取农业丰收创造条件；坚决贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，保证互助合作运动的健康发展；切实办好国营农场；做好农村经济工作，支持春耕生产；重视发展养畜业，动员群众解决饲料问题；防治自然灾害是争取农业全面丰收的中心关键；改进和提高今年的农业贷款工作；认真培养农业劳动模范，以活的榜样教育广大农民走社会主义道路；积极发展信用合作等。此外，还围绕着发展互助合作运动，推广先进生产技术和防治自然灾害，以及经济工作为春耕生产服务等方面的许多具体问题，发表了一系列的述评、短评及其他形式的评论。这些评论一方面加深了社论的影响，另一方面又是对于社论的具体阐述和补充。
    随着评论工作的加强，报纸对于实际工作的指导作用也加强了。如在宣传总路线和购粮的初期，浙江日报介绍了基点乡的经验，配合发表了社论，各地农村工作干部都反映：“有了具体经验，又有理论根据，帮助很大。”又如在宣传购粮期间，不少地区忽视了对当前生产的领导，甚至挤掉了生产工作，有些干部怀疑生产工作能否和购粮工作同时进行。报纸针对这种情况，发表了“在宣传总路线和购粮期间可以也必须同时搞好冬季生产”、“继续深入进行总路线宣传，提高农民的生产积极性”等社论，批判了“戴生产帽子”实际上忽视生产的偏向，使原来有怀疑的干部端正了认识，重视搞好生产工作。如当时诸暨县冬修水利工作正是紧张的时候，诸暨县副县长见报后即召集农林干部作了专门研究，并通报各区，推动了全县水利工作的开展。随着评论工作的加强，报纸同群众的联系也加强了。许多读者特别是农村工作干部反映：“看到浙江日报的评论，就可以知道省委的意图了。”“我们对有些工作原来不重视，党报上一提就注意去抓了。”不少县区干部把登有重要评论的报纸随身带着，边学边做。
    浙江日报的评论工作所以能得到初步的改善，是同党委加强对这一工作的领导分不开的。这一时
  期浙江省委负责同志除亲自为报纸撰写社论外，还给编辑部出评论题目，具体指示评论的要点，大力组织报纸的评论。上述农村工作方面的十六篇社论，大部分是省委提出具体内容，责成报社和各部门写成的。省委还曾责成农村工作部负责同志召开专门会议，吸收省人民政府农林厅、供销合作社、人民银行、省委宣传部、青年团、妇联等有关单位的同志参加，来研究报纸一定时期的评论计划。省财委也召开过同样的会议。经过党委的具体指示和各有关部门的共同研究，报纸的评论计划就有可能制订得更加全面和完善。这样的评论计划不仅指导了报纸的评论工作，而且指导了报纸的全部宣传活动，成了报纸在一定时期内的宣传纲领。
    当然，浙江日报评论工作的加强，也是编辑部提高了对评论工作的认识，克服了单纯依赖党委和业务部门的思想，发挥了积极性和主动性的结果。这一时期编辑部曾在注意研究党委意图和实际工作情况的基础上，定期地制订了报纸的评论计划，并力求计划做到全面、均衡，既着重于中心任务和群众生活中的迫切问题，又照顾到一般工作，尽可能做到对社会生活的各方面都有相适应的评论。编辑部领导同志则把制订评论计划和检查、督促评论计划的完成当作自己的一项经常的主要的任务。为了保证评论计划的实现，编辑部大力发动和组织了社内外的写作力量。本来报社内部的同志和党委、政府各业务部门的负责同志中，对于撰写评论特别是社论都存有畏难情绪，认为这是代表党委讲话的，要求高，写不了。为克服这种畏难情绪，浙江日报首先从内部着手，把社内的写作力量发动起来，编辑部各领导同志先带头多写，并逐步扩大到组长、编辑。在同志们开始写评论时，领导方面曾主动提出题目和主要内容，并耐心帮助修改。这些评论被采用了，并得到了读者的良好反映，大家写评论的信心和积极性也就日益提高了。以农村组为例，一九五三年上半年这个组的同志只写了五、六篇述评，而今年上半年报纸上发表的有关农村工作的六十多篇述评，则大都是他们自己写的。在发动内部写作力量的过程中，更重要的是提高大家的政策思想水平和写作能力。在这方面编辑部曾经做了这样一些工作（虽然还不够经常）：及时传达有关的政策指示，组织学习；邀请党政领导机关的负责同志到报社来做政策性的报告；以报道组为单位，每周研究实际情况和政策问题，根据研究的结果确定评论的题目和内容；有组织地进行业余的语文学习；用
  “文章病院”、“报纸检查”等办法来改进写作中的缺点；专门总结和检查评论的写作工作。在发动内部力量的同时，浙江日报也开始注意组织外部的写作力量。由于报纸上发表的评论日益增多，编辑部又有计划地邀请各部门负责同志写稿，各部门撰写评论的积极性也逐渐提高。如省委农村工作部、省人民政府农林厅等单位都主动为报纸撰写评论，通过报纸来指导工作。浙江日报组织评论写作队伍的经验表明，只要编辑部在实践过程中注意帮助大家提高对党的方针政策的理解能力，提高对实际情况的调查研究能力，提高写作能力，并善于根据各业务部门同志的特长来发动他们写作，社内外写作评论的潜在力量是可以逐步发挥起来的。
    浙江日报加强评论的工作刚刚开始，虽然初步收到了一些成效，但也存在着一些问题。首先是评论的计划性还不够周密，评论的题材不够多样化。目前关于思想工作的评论最为薄弱。对于工业生产、基本建设等方面的评论工作也较薄弱。其次是评论的质量不高。有些评论还存在着一般化、说服力不强等缺点。再次，评论题目的来源，大部分还是按照领导意图拟定的；至于编辑部如何主动地从深入研究实际生活中发现问题撰写评论，却做得不够。这些缺点还需要浙江日报编辑部从加强同实际、同群众的联系入手来逐步加以克服。只有克服了这些缺点，才能够坚持评论的经常化和不断提高评论的质量，更好地发挥党报作为党的有力助手的作用。
