To the Editor:

    I am a lover of handicrafts, and I have a particular fondness for ivory carvings. Every time I see ivory carvings of chicks vying to peck at food under the shade of willows, chrysanthemums standing proudly against the frost, the lifelike patriotic poet Qu Yuan, lively and cheerful Young Pioneers, or the magnificent Tiananmen Square, I am always amazed by the magical and superb skills of the ivory carvers. My heart swells with joy, and I feel proud that our country has such skillful and intelligent artisans. But after the joy and pride, I think more about a problem: How can we ensure that the superb skills of these artisans are passed down through the ages, and that our country's precious artistic heritage is further promoted? How can we enable existing artisans to continuously improve their skills and create more exquisite and novel crafts to enrich the cultural life of our people? This is indeed a problem worthy of attention. As far as I know, most of the skilled artisans now are over forty years old, there are very few young people, and their technical level is not high. If this situation continues, in the future, "when people die, their skills will be lost, and unique skills will be lost." Our country's excellent national art tradition of arts and crafts will not be preserved and carried forward. I remember that in July of this year, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives’ "Report on the Third National Handicraft Production Cooperation Conference" published in the People's Daily mentioned that during the most difficult years of the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union, the Party and the Soviet government also took various special measures to protect and develop the people's handicraft industry. The Soviet government once had a special resolution ordering these skilled artisans to be demobilized so that they could continue their creative work. They were given many preferential treatments in terms of food and material supply, and various rare raw materials were allocated to them. At the same time, various craft schools were established. The Soviet spirit of attaching importance to preserving and carrying forward the national art tradition is worth learning from. Although our country is currently carrying out large-scale economic construction, it is impossible to open many craft schools to train a new generation of artisans, but some methods can still be considered. For example, a ivory carving class could be set up in the sculpture department of the Academy of Fine Arts, and highly skilled and well-known artisans could be invited to lecture to young students and impart ivory carving skills. Or, the Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative could appropriately recruit some apprentices, and the cooperative could draw some money from the public accumulation fund to subsidize meals for a period of time (about a year, the apprentices can support themselves), and train them. If the cooperative cannot solve it, can the state consider subsidizing the apprentices' meals? At the same time, in order to enable the existing ivory carvers to further improve their skills, it is also possible to consider allowing them to audit classes at the Central Academy of Fine Arts or other relevant schools to learn some basic principles of sculpture. In short, I think this problem can be solved as long as the relevant departments pay attention.

      Investigation Report by Our Newspaper Reporter

    The opinions raised by reader Zuo Jia on improving the technical level of existing artisans and cultivating a new generation of artisans are worthy of attention. To this end, the reporter conducted investigations and understanding from relevant units such as the Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative, the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, and the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company.

    At present, the Beijing Ivory Carving Production Cooperative is the only organization that produces ivory handicrafts, and it is also the only institution capable of training apprentices. This cooperative was formally established in July 1953. Now there are more than 60 people participating in production in the entire cooperative, most of whom are over 40 years old. There are only 15 young people under 25 years old, and no new apprentices have been recruited since the establishment of the cooperative.

    Can the cooperative recruit some new apprentices for training? According to the reporter’s understanding, because the production of handicrafts takes a long time, the turnover of funds is difficult, and the public accumulation is small, if apprentices are added at present, the cooperative will not be able to solve the apprentices' meals and the master craftsmen's wages. However, cultivating a new generation of artistic talents is indeed a matter of urgency, because ivory carving cannot be learned in a short period of time. Generally, apprentices can only make some crickets and cabbages after four or five years of learning. At present, most of the twenty-odd people in the cooperative who can do chiseling work are master craftsmen with 20 or 30 years of service, and a few are under 40 years old. If someone is unable to work for some reason, production will be immediately affected.

    Based on the above situation, it seems that it is impossible to completely rely on the ivory carving production cooperative to solve the problem of cultivating a new generation of artisans. The relevant authorities must give necessary support and assistance. In the past, the leaders of the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation always believed that the ivory carving production cooperative had too little accumulation to train apprentices, thus showing a passive attitude. In the future, they should proceed from the actual situation and actively help solve this problem. When the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company entrusts the cooperative to process products, it must determine the amount of processing fees according to the art value of the products in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the members to study technology. In terms of improving technology, the Central Academy of Fine Arts has given the ivory carving production cooperative a lot of concrete help in the past, and in the future, it should continue to adhere to the principle of combining art workers and artisans, and actively and regularly provide the ivory carving production cooperative with help so that the artisans' skills can be further improved.

    Finally, it is hoped that the relevant leading organs such as the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives can consider the opinions raised by the readers and jointly negotiate to solve this problem.

### 必须注意培养新一代的手工艺人

专栏：

    必须注意培养新一代的手工艺人编辑同志：
    我是一个手工艺品的爱好者，特别对象牙雕刻的工艺品更有特殊爱好。每次当我看到象牙雕刻的在柳荫下争相啄食的小鸡，独傲霜寒的菊花，栩栩如生的爱国诗人屈原，活泼愉快的少先队员，或是雄伟壮丽的天安门时，常常惊叹于牙雕艺人技术的神奇、高超，内心里禁不住涌起一阵喜悦，为我们祖国有着这样灵巧、智慧的手工艺人而感到骄傲。但是在喜悦和骄傲过后，我还更多地想到一个问题：怎样才能使这些手工艺人的绝技千古流传下去，使我们祖国宝贵的艺术遗产更加发扬光大；怎样使现在已有的手工艺人能够不断提高技术，制作出更精美更新颖的工艺品来，丰富我国人民文化生活的内容。这确是一个值得重视的问题。据我了解，现在一般有技术的手工艺人大多是四十岁以上的，年青的人很少，而且技术水平不高。这种情况如果继续下去，将来就会“人亡艺绝，绝技失传”，我国美术工艺品优秀的民族艺术传统就将无法保存和发扬光大。记得今年七月人民日报上发表的中华全国合作社联合总社“关于第三次全国手工业生产合作会议的报告”中，曾提到苏联在伟大的卫国战争最艰苦的年代，党和苏维埃政府还采取各种特殊措施来保护和发展人民手工艺行业。苏联政府曾经有一个特别决议，令这些手工艺能手退伍，以便继续他们自己的创造性的工作。在粮食和物质供应方面给予了他们很多优待，并拨给他们各种稀有的原料。同时设立了各种工艺学校。苏联这种重视保存和发扬民族艺术传统的精神，很值得我们学习。虽然今天我们国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，不可能开办许多工艺学校来培养新一代的手工艺人，但是有些办法还是可以考虑采用的。比如在美术学院的雕塑系里设一个牙雕班，聘请技术高超的著名手工艺人去给青年学生讲课，传授牙雕技术。或者是由北京市象牙雕刻生产合作社适当招收一些艺徒，由合作社从公积金内抽出一些钱来补贴一个时期的伙食（大约一年光景，艺徒就可以自己维持生活），加以培养。如果合作社不可能解决，国家是否能考虑补贴艺徒伙食？同时，为了使现有的牙雕艺人能更进一步地提高技术，也可以考虑让他们到中央美术学院或其他有关学校去旁听，学习一些基本的雕塑原理。总之，我认为这个问题只要有关部门注意就可以设法解决。
                        北京读者　左嘉
      本报记者的调查报告
    读者左嘉提出的提高现有手工艺人的技术水平和培养新一代的手工艺人的意见是值得重视的。为此，记者特向北京市象牙雕刻生产合作社、北京市手工业生产合作社联合社和北京市特种工艺公司等有关单位进行调查了解。
    目前，北京市象牙雕刻生产合作社是唯一制作象牙手工艺品的组织，也是唯一能够培养艺徒的机构。这个合作社是一九五三年七月正式组成的。现在全社参加生产的共有六十多人，其中大部分是四十岁以上的人，二十五岁以下的青年只有十五人，建社以后没有招收一个新的艺徒。
    合作社能否招收一些新的艺徒加以培养呢？据记者了解，因为制作工艺品的时间较长，资金周转困难，公共积累很少，如果目前增添艺徒，艺徒的伙食和老师傅的工资社里无力解决。但是，培养新一代的艺术人材，也确是刻不容缓的事，因为象牙雕刻不是一朝一夕可以学会的，一般艺徒学了四、五年还只会作一些蝈蝈、白菜之类的东西。目前社里二十几个会做凿活的，大多是已有二、三十年工龄的老师傅，个别的是四十岁以下的人，如有人因故不能工作，生产马上就会受到影响。
    根据以上情况看来，要完全依靠象牙雕刻生产合作社来解决培养新一代的手工艺人的问题是不可能的，有关机关必须给予必要的支持和帮助。北京市手工业生产合作社联合社领导方面过去总认为象牙雕刻生产合作社的积累太少无力培养艺徒，因而表现了消极。今后应从实际情况出发，积极帮助解决这一问题。北京市特种工艺公司，在委托合作社加工时，必须按照产品艺术价值的高低来决定加工费的多少，以鼓励社员钻研技术的积极性。在提高技术方面，中央美术学院过去给了象牙雕刻生产合作社不少具体帮助，今后仍应本着美术工作者和手工艺人相结合的原则，积极地、经常地给象牙雕刻生产合作社以帮助，使手工艺人的技术得到更进一步的提高。
    最后，希望文化部、对外贸易部、中华全国合作总社等有关领导机关，能够考虑一下读者所提意见，共同协商解决这一问题。
