　　More than 1,500 primary school graduates in Xi'an who failed to enter higher education this year have all been properly resettled. Among them, 650 have returned to their original schools to study, 397 have participated in production work, and the remaining students have entered tutoring classes and self-study groups for learning.

　　The city's districts have successively established a total of ten tutoring classes and ten self-study groups, with more than 400 people participating in the study. The content of the study focuses on strengthening ideological education and imparting technical knowledge. In the urban area, the courses include Chinese language, bookkeeping, and abacus calculation, while the suburbs focus on Chinese language and agricultural production knowledge. Each tutoring class and self-study group has teachers who are responsible for teaching and providing guidance. With the enthusiastic help of the teachers, the students can study with peace of mind and conscientiousness. Some of the students participating in tutoring classes and self-study groups have also been absorbed into local social activities. For example, in the Panjia Village self-study group in the Twelfth District, some serve as teachers in amateur schools, and some help reading groups read newspapers. Therefore, they have improved politically and culturally, and at the same time, they have changed their previous mistaken idea that there is no future if they fail to enter school.

    西安未能升学的高小毕业生得到妥善安置
    西安市今年未能升学的一千五百多名高小毕业生已全部获得安置。其中有六百五十人回原校学习，有三百九十七人参加生产工作，其余的学生已分别进入补习班和自学小组进行学习。
    本市各区先后共成立了十个补习班和十个自学小组，参加学习的有四百多人。学习的内容，着重加强思想教育及传授技术知识。在城关区学习的课程有语文、簿记和珠算等，郊区则偏重于语文和农业生产知识。各补习班和自学小组均有教员担任教学和进行辅导，同学们在老师热心的帮助下，都能安心认真地学习。参加补习班和自学小组的学生中，有一部分还被吸收参加了当地的社会活动。如十二区潘家村自学小组，有的担任业余学校的教员，有的帮助读报组读报等，因此他们在政治上和文化上都有了提高，同时，也改变了过去认为考不上学校就没有前途的错误想法。
