Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 23rd: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in response to questions in the People's House of the Indian Parliament on the 22nd, delivered a speech regarding his visit to China.

Referring to his lengthy talks with Chinese leaders, Prime Minister Nehru said: "The topics of discussion were numerous, all of interest to one or both of us. We were both very clear about the differences in the political or economic structures of our two governments and countries, and we did not debate these issues. Starting from this basis, we have a great degree of consensus in our attitude towards various issues and the many domestic and international problems we both face. We discussed these issues frankly, without constraint or reservation. We have found that the differences in our political or economic structures need not hinder cooperation in many areas, especially in our efforts to strive for peace in Asia and the world. Indeed, the basis of our talks was to maintain peace, because we both firmly believe that peace, apart from its many benefits for the whole world, is essential for us to build our two countries.
    "We believe that peace is not a passive avoidance of war, but an active therapeutic means, which, following peace, can free people from fear and suspicion and bring about trust that promotes gradual cooperation."

Nehru said, "I had hoped that after visiting in person and meeting the figures who created the new China, I would gain a deeper understanding. I think in this respect I can say my visit was successful..."

Prime Minister Nehru spoke of his impressions of visiting China, saying, "The tremendous changes that have taken place there in recent years have undoubtedly had a tremendous impact on the vast population of that country. Perhaps the biggest change is the social change, but I also found that the people have deep-rooted ties with the past, and they have not abandoned the great cultural heritage they have always been proud of. I also found that they have a deep and broad friendship with India and the Indian people, which is not only the result of the present – although the present is very important to this friendship – but has a far-reaching foundation."

He continued: "I felt in China – just as I often feel in India – that tremendous changes are taking place on our Asian continent, disrupting the old balance and seeking a new balance. Unless this irresistible fact is recognized, unless there is a full understanding that these historical developments cannot be reversed, it is impossible to understand what is happening in many parts of Asia. Perhaps some of the difficulties in the world today are due to a lack of understanding of this great development in human history."

Nehru added: "Apart from the conflicts that exist in many parts of the world, the main difficulty seems to be widespread fear and reactions to this widespread fear."
    "As we had done previously in New Delhi, we discussed this issue in Beijing, and we agreed that everything possible should be done to eliminate this fear and doubt in people's minds in order to create a more conducive atmosphere for considering and resolving problems. Chinese leaders told me that they were very willing to do so, and I have no doubt that they were sincere, because today's environment, even from the viewpoint of national interest, requires such a course of action. I believe that the 'Five Principles' or the five major foundations – I would like to use this name – that we agreed upon a few months ago seem to provide a solid foundation for friendly exchanges between countries."
    "In my opinion, the Chinese people desire peace and are willing to maintain friendship with other countries, but the environment hinders normal contact and understanding, thereby causing extreme distrust of each other. I believe that to eliminate all obstacles to contact and understanding, we should try to eliminate this mutual distrust. There is already some degree of mutual understanding between India and China, and therefore, on a larger scale, it must be welcomed. It is a step towards peace in Asia or even towards world peace."

The final part of Prime Minister Nehru's speech said: "The Geneva Conference marked a turning point in post-war history. Unfortunately, the Manila Treaty has somewhat undermined the new atmosphere that the Geneva Conference had begun to create. Nevertheless, in recent months there have been many signs that this world atmosphere has improved, and this improvement must be attributed to all the major powers. In short, I would like to say that the political consequences of my visit to China are to deepen the understanding between India and China, to know its claims and what it strives for, and to know that among the tasks facing India and China, many are common, and it is appropriate for them to cooperate to the greatest extent possible."

### 尼赫鲁发表关于访问我国的谈话  认为五项原则为各国和平共处提供了坚实基础

    尼赫鲁发表关于访问我国的谈话
    认为五项原则为各国和平共处提供了坚实基础
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】印度总理尼赫鲁二十二日在印度国会人民院答复问题时，发表关于他访问中国的谈话。
    提到他和中国领袖们的长时间会谈尼赫鲁总理说：“会谈的问题很多，都是我们一方或双方感觉兴趣的问题。我们双方都很清楚地知道我们两个政府和国家的政治或经济结构方面的不同，我们并没有辩论这些问题。从这个基础出发，我们在对待各种不同问题和我们都有的许多国内外问题的态度上有很大程度的一致。我们坦白地，毫无拘束或保留地讨论了这些问题。我们发现，在我们政治或经济结构方面存在的那种不同不一定要妨碍我们在许多方面进行合作，特别是在我们为争取亚洲及世界和平这方面更是如此。的确，我们会谈的基础就是维护和平，因为我们都坚决地认为和平除了它对全世界的种种好处之外，是使我们能够建设我们两个国家所必不可少的东西。
    “我们认为和平并不是消极的避免战争，而是一种积极的治疗的手段，随着和平之后可以使人免于恐惧和猜疑，并且可以带来一些促进逐渐合作的信任。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我曾希望，在我亲自去访问以及会晤那些创造新中国的人物后，我就能得到某种更为深切的了解。我觉得在这一方面我可以说我的访问是成功的……”
    尼赫鲁总理谈到访问中国的印象时说：“那里在最近几年中发生的巨大变化，毫无疑问地已对那个国家的广大人民有着巨大的影响。也许最大的变化是社会方面的变化，但是我也发现人民和过去有根深蒂固的关系，他们并未抛弃他们一向引以为荣的伟大的文化遗产。我还发现他们对印度和印度人民怀有深厚而广泛的友情，这种友情不仅是目前的结果——虽然目前对这种友情也有很大的关系——而是有着深远的基础的。”
    他继续说：“我在中国感到——正像我经常在印度感到的那样——我们亚洲大陆上发生了巨大的变化，它们破坏了旧日的均势，正在寻求新的均势。除非承认这个不可抗拒的事实，除非充分认识到这些历史进展是不能倒转的，否则就不能了解亚洲的许多地方正在发生的事情。或许目前世界上的困难有一些就是由于对人类历史上这种伟大的发展缺少了解所致。”
    尼赫鲁又说：“除开世界许多地方存在的冲突以外，主要的困难似乎是普遍的恐惧和对这种普遍恐惧的反应。”
      “正如我们先前在新德里所做的一样，我们在北京讨论了这个问题，我们一致同意应尽一切办法消除人心中的这种恐惧和疑虑以便造成更加有助于考虑和解决问题的气氛，中国领袖们向我说，他们是很希望这样做的，我毫不怀疑他们说的是真心话，因为今日的环境，即使从民族利益观点出发也是要求采取这种行动方针的。我认为，数月前我们商订的‘五项原则’或五大基础——我愿意用这个名称——看来为国与国之间的友好交往提供了坚实的基础。”
      “据我看来，中国人民都希望和平，愿意和其他国家保持友好，但是环境阻碍了正常的接触和谅解，从而使彼此极不信任。我认为，要消除这一切妨害接触和谅解的障碍，就应该想法消除这种互不信任的情况。印度和中国之间已经有了某种程度的相互谅解，因此，在较大的方面，也必须欢迎它。它是走向亚洲和平或甚至是走向世界和平的一步。”
    尼赫鲁总理谈话的最后部分说：“日内瓦会议标志着战后历史的一个转折点。不幸，马尼拉条约却多少破坏了日内瓦会议所开始产生的那种新的气氛。尽管如此，在最近的几个月中却有了许多迹象表明这种世界气氛已有所改善，这种改善是必须归功于所有各大国的。简言之，我愿意说，我此次访问中国的政治后果是加深了印度和中国之间的谅解，并知道了它的主张以及它所为之而奋斗的东西，并知道，在印中两国所面临的任务中，有许多是共同的，它们在尽可能大的程度上进行合作是适宜的。”
