Hebei Province is actively carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to statistics from eight special districts including Baoding, Tangshan, Cangxian, and Shijiazhuang City as of late October, more than 30,000 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established, with more than 640,000 farm households participating; more than 10,000 other cooperatives are under establishment. During the same period, existing agricultural production cooperatives were also rectified. According to statistics from six special districts including Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, and Xingtai, the number of agricultural production cooperatives after rectification, merger, and expansion decreased by more than 2,400, while the number of participating farm households increased by more than 78 percent.

In terms of methods of rectification and development, various localities generally adopted two approaches: one is that the county and district leadership grasp key points, leading the general situation. For example, in the establishment, review, and rectification of the fifth district of Yongnian County, the key cooperatives grasped by the district party committee took the lead, absorbing the second batch of cadres for rectifying and establishing cooperatives and village cadres to participate, learning while rectifying and establishing. Using this method, 46 new cooperatives were established. The other is to give play to the grassroots leadership role of mutual aid and cooperation networks (stations), with experienced people leading novices. Each station has one person from the district party committee personally responsible for leadership, and regular station meetings are held to guide the work of general cooperatives through the experience of key cooperatives. Donghuadian Township in Quzhou County used this method to rectify and establish 26 new cooperatives.

Due to the development of agricultural production cooperatives and the change in leadership methods, the mutual aid and cooperation networks (stations) in various localities have been reorganized, giving full play to the role of the networks. According to information from 17 counties including Anping, Yuanshi, and Huolu, 324 new mutual aid and cooperation networks (stations) have been established. In many villages and townships in Shenze County, in order to solve the difficult problems of the new cooperatives, eleven temporary cooperative establishment consultation offices were established with the township as the unit, and 73 major problems were solved in ten days, which was well received by the masses. Ding County dispatched a large number of cadres in conjunction with district and township cadres to go deep into villages and cooperatives to specifically help rectify and review old cooperatives. From October 15th to 24th, the county reviewed and rectified a total of 230 cooperatives. After rectification, 124 cooperatives solved the legacy problems of land evaluation and property contribution, 49 cooperatives revised their articles of association and solved some unreasonable problems, which improved the enthusiasm of cooperative members to unite for production, and 41 cooperatives purged 64 households of landlords and rich peasants, purifying the composition of the cooperatives and consolidating their organization.

Most of the Communist Party members in the rural areas of Shunyi County, Hebei Province, have joined agricultural production cooperatives. According to recent statistics, more than 3,690 party members have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 87 percent of the county's agricultural party members. These Communist Party members not only take the lead in joining the cooperatives, but also actively publicize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to the farmers. Therefore, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shunyi County has developed rapidly. In the spring of 1952, only one agricultural production cooperative was established in the county on a trial basis. This autumn, it has developed to more than 1,100. The number of farm households joining the cooperatives reached more than 35,300, accounting for 49 percent of the county's total farm households. Because party members are active, responsible, and selfless in their work, they are generally supported by the masses, and many party members have been elected as leading cadres of the cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,400 party members serve as chairmen, vice-chairmen, directors, and managers in the cooperatives. In addition, many party members have been elected as production team leaders and group leaders.

The Communist Party organizations and party members in rural areas not only lead and organize farmers to join cooperatives, but also actively learn the skills of running cooperatives, leading and helping farmers to run the cooperatives well. (Li Jun Chang Ling)

    河北省积极发展和整顿农业生产合作社
    顺义县农村中的共产党员带动并组织广大农民入社
    河北省互助合作运动正在普遍开展，据保定、唐山、沧县等八个专区和石家庄市截至十月下旬的统计，已新建农业生产合作社三万多个，参加农户六十四万多户；另有一万多个社正在建立中。在同一期间，对旧有农业生产合作社也进行了整顿，据石家庄、天津、邢台等六个专区统计，原有农业生产合作社经整顿合并扩大后，社数较前减少二千四百多个，而入社农户比以前增加了百分之七十八以上。
    各地在整顿和发展的方法上，一般采用了两种办法：一种是，县、区领导上掌握重点，带动一般的领导方法，如永年县五区在建立和审查整顿中，区委掌握的重点社先走一步，吸收第二批整社建社干部和乡村干部参加，边学习、边整顿建立，用这种办法建立了四十六个新社。另一种是，发挥互助合作网（站）的基层领导作用，熟手带新手，每站有区委一人亲自负责领导，定期召开站的会议，通过重点社经验，指导一般社工作。曲周县东花店乡采用这个办法整顿建立了二十六个新社。
    由于农业生产合作社的发展，和领导方法的转变，各地对互助合作网（站）都重新进行了整顿，充分发挥了网的作用。据安平、元氏、获鹿等十七个县了解，新建互助合作网（站）三百二十四个。深泽县不少乡村，为解决新社的疑难问题，以乡为单位建立了十一个临时建社问事处，十天即解答了七十三件较大的问题，深受群众欢迎。定县抽出大批干部结合区、乡干部深入到村社，具体帮助整顿审查旧社，该县从十月十五日到二十四日共审查整顿了二百三十个社，经过整顿一百二十四个社解决了土地评产、农具入社等遗留问题，四十九个社修订了社章，解决了一些不合理问题，提高了社员团结生产的热情，四十一个社清除了地主、富农分子六十四户，纯洁了社的成分，巩固了组织。　（冯英杰）×××
    河北省顺义县农村中的共产党员，大部分都参加了农业生产合作社。据最近统计，入社党员已有三千六百九十多名，占全县农业党员的百分之八十七。这些共产党员，他们不仅自己带头入社，还积极向农民宣传农业生产合作社的优越性。所以顺义县的互助合作运动发展较快。一九五二年春全县只试办了一个农业生产合作社，今年秋天已发展到一千一百多个。入社农户达三万五千三百多户，占全县总农户的百分之四十九。由于党员对工作积极负责、大公无私，普遍受到群众拥护，很多党员被选为社的领导干部。据全县不完全统计，党员在社内当社长、副社长、股长和管理人员的就有二千四百多名。另外还有很多党员当选为生产队长和组长。
    农村中的共产党组织和党员，不仅带动和组织农民入社，还积极学习办社的本领，领导和帮助农民把合作社办好。　（力军　长灵）
