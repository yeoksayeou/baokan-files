Xinhua News Agency report: Democratic parties and organizations in the German Democratic Republic resolutely oppose the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the revival of West German militarism, and warmly welcome the Soviet government's proposal of October 23 regarding the speedy restoration of German unification and the safeguarding of European security.

The Presidium of the Central Standing Committee of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany passed a resolution on the political situation caused by the Soviet government's note and the Paris Agreements, saying: The Soviet Union proposes holding a four-power conference in order to reach an agreement on the peaceful restoration of German unification in a democratic manner, the withdrawal of all occupation forces, the holding of free all-German elections, and all issues related to European collective security. This is a path leading to the true sovereignty and happiness of all the German people. The Paris Agreements, on the other hand, will trap Germany in permanent division, turn West Germany into a territory occupied until 1998, drag West Germany into the Western aggressive bloc system, deprive Germany of the Saar region, and further consolidate American control over Europe. The resolution pointed out that this situation requires Germans to make a clear decision immediately: Germans must reach an agreement among themselves and dedicate all their strength to realizing the Soviet proposals.

The Central Committee of the Free Democratic Party of Germany issued a statement calling on all party members to fight against the Paris Agreements and to realize the Soviet proposals.

Kurtz, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, published an article entitled "All Circles in Germany Warmly Welcome the Soviet Proposal on the Withdrawal of Occupation Forces" in the "Truth" newspaper on October 30. His article emphasized that the working people of West Germany are increasingly feeling that the residence of the occupation forces of the United States, Britain, and France is a heavy burden on them. The article wrote: The people of West Germany have to bear a huge cost of 9.4 billion marks annually for foreign occupation forces, and West German newspapers openly say that in order to equip 500,000 West German soldiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 100 billion marks will be levied, which means that the Bonn authorities want each family in West Germany to bear a debt of about 8,500 marks. Kurtz concluded by writing: The German people are fighting to restore German unification, to conclude a peace treaty, and to withdraw the occupation forces. The German people are very grateful to the Soviet Union for its new initiative aimed at resolving the German issue without delay.

Xinhua News Agency report: The "new" plan to revive German militarism, drafted in London and Paris, has been opposed by the British people and some political figures.

The Joint Committee of Shop Stewards, composed of workers from eleven Lewis Lowes factories in Britain, unanimously passed a resolution opposing the rearmament of West Germany and guaranteeing support for the West German trade unions' demand for a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States, believing that such a conference "can lead to a peaceful resolution of the German issue."

British Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan also published an article not long ago opposing the London Agreement on the rearmament of West Germany, and believing that the British government's promise at the London Conference to station troops in Europe for a long time in order to arm West Germany would be detrimental to Britain. In the article, Bevan pointed out that the financial burden of stationing troops in Europe is very heavy. If Britain asks the United States for assistance, it will be bound by a double obligation: to provide manpower to Europe; and to owe debt to the United States. If it does not seek American aid but relies on its own resources, it will have a serious impact on the British standard of living. The long-term stationing of troops in Europe will also make it impossible to shorten the term of national military service, which will affect Britain's manpower. More importantly, Britain runs the risk of not being able to control a large part of its budget to some extent. Bevan emphasized that the tensions in Europe cannot be eased while the West German army is being built.

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 3rd dispatch: According to a TASS report from Brussels on the 2nd, the National Committee of the Belgian Peace League issued a resolution calling for the rejection of the London Agreement and the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany, and demanding a solution to the German issue through negotiations.

The resolution said: These agreements are particularly dangerous for Belgium, which has suffered twice from German militarism in the past decades. They foreshadow a new increase in Belgium's defense spending.

The resolution pointed out: The recent discussions on disarmament at the United Nations have raised new hopes for reaching an agreement on this issue.

The resolution also said: Only through negotiations is it possible to eliminate the threat of forming a new source of war in the heart of Europe, and only then is it possible to obtain the German reunification that the German people themselves demand and guarantee the security of Germany's neighbors in Europe.

The resolution concluded: The conflicts in Korea and Indochina have been resolved through negotiations under the pressure of world public opinion. We demand that the German issue also be resolved through negotiations between the major powers.

    民主德国、英国、比利时等国广大公众
    反对重新武装西德要求尽速恢复德国统一
    据新华社讯：德意志民主共和国各民主党派和组织坚决反对规定复活西德军国主义的巴黎协定，热烈欢迎苏联政府十月二十三日的照会中提出的关于尽速恢复德国统一和保障欧洲安全的建议。
    德国基督教民主联盟中央常务委员会主席团就苏联政府的照会和巴黎协定所引起的政治形势通过决议说：苏联建议举行四国会议，以便就依照民主的方式和平地恢复德国的统一、撤退一切占领军、举行全德自由选举问题和一切有关欧洲集体安全的问题达成协议。这是一条导向全体德国人民的真正主权和幸福的道路。而巴黎协定将使德国永远陷于分裂，将使西德变成一块直到一九九八年仍被占领的领土，将把西德拖进西方侵略集团体系，把德国的萨尔地区剥夺，使美国对欧洲的控制进一步巩固。决议指出，这种形势要求德国人必须立刻作出明确的决定：德国人之间必须达成协议并为实现苏联的建议而献出全部力量。
    德国自由民主党中央委员会发表声明，号召全体党员为反对巴黎协定和实现苏联的建议而奋斗。
    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯在十月三十日的“真理报”上发表一篇题为“德国各界热烈欢迎苏联提出的关于撤退占领军的建议”的文章。他的文章着重指出：西德的劳动人民越来越深刻地感觉到美、英、法三国占领军的居留是他们的沉重的负担。文章写道：西德人民每年要为外国占领军负担九十四亿马克的庞大费用，西德报刊并且公开地说，为了装备五十万北大西洋公约组织的西德士兵，将要征收一千亿马克，这就是说，波恩当局要西德的每个家庭担负大约八千五百马克的债务。柯伦斯最后写道：德国人民正在为争取恢复德国的统一、争取缔结和约和撤退占领军而斗争。德国人民十分感谢苏联提出的旨在不再拖延地解决德国问题的新倡议。
    据新华社讯：在伦敦和巴黎拟订的复活德国军国主义的“新”计划，受到英国人民和一些政界人士的反对。
    由英国十一个路尔斯·劳埃斯工厂的工人组成的车间代表全英联合委员会一致通过一个决议，反对重新武装西德，并且保证支持西德各工会关于召开苏、法、英、美四国会议的要求，认为这种会议
  “能导致德国问题的和平解决”。
    英国工党左翼领袖比万也在不久以前发表文章，反对重新武装西德的伦敦协定，并且认为英国政府为了要武装西德而在伦敦会议上答应长期驻军欧洲会给英国带来损害。比万在文章里指出：驻军欧洲的财政负担很重。如果英国要求美国援助，它就会受到双重义务的束缚：对欧洲要出人力；对美国又要负债。如果它不求美援而倚靠自己的资源，就会对英国的生活水平有严重影响。长期驻军欧洲还会使得国民兵役期限无法缩短，而影响到英国的人力。而更重要的，是英国有在某种程度上不能控制自己的很大一部分预算的危险。比万强调：在西德军队正在建立起来的时候，欧洲的紧张局势并不能有所缓和。
   【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔二日讯：比利时和平联盟全国委员会发表一项决议，号召拒绝武装西德的伦敦协定和巴黎协定，要求通过谈判来解决德国问题。
    决议说：这些协定对于在过去几十年中两度受德国军国主义祸害的比利时是特别危险的。它们预示比利时的国防费用会有新的增加。
    决议指出：联合国最近举行的关于裁减军备的讨论，使得人们重新希望就这一问题达成协议。
    决议又说：只有通过谈判才有可能消除在欧洲的心脏地带形成一个新的战争策源地的威胁，才有可能获得德国人民自己所要求的德国重新统一和保证欧洲邻国的安全。
    决议最后说：朝鲜和印度支那的冲突已经在世界舆论的压力下，通过谈判得到解决了。我们要求德国问题也通过大国间的谈判得到解决。
