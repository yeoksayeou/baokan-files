    Strive to Master New Technologies
    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory Office
    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is equipped with the most advanced Soviet technology and top-notch Soviet machinery, some of which are the first products of 1954. The product range is extensive, with over 2,000 specifications for cutting tools alone. Precision requirements are extremely strict. For example, the smallest drill bit (a type of product) is thinner than a pig bristle (0.25 mm in diameter), and the tolerance for the most precise gauges cannot exceed one-thousandth of the thickness of a hair (0.00007 mm). Therefore, to master the production of such a precision factory, a high level of technical and managerial expertise is required.

    Our current technical level falls far short of the requirements of this new type of factory. Our workers, technicians, and managers are familiar with old-style machine tools and relatively ordinary products. They feel unfamiliar with the new equipment, new products, new processing methods, and management systems. We have a gauge workshop director with 33 years of experience who can only recognize the names of two machines in the gauge section and has never seen many of the machines. In the beginning, we did not have a single worker who could adjust automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. According to the original design requirements, the average skill level of technical workers in the factory should be 4.5, but in reality, in the drill bit workshop, grades one and two workers account for 80 percent.

    Technical backwardness has become the biggest obstacle to transitioning to normal production. Striving to improve the existing technical level has become the most urgent and critical task for all employees.

    Initially, we had an extremely inadequate understanding of the difficulties and complexities of mastering new technologies. Some comrades believed that once the buildings were built and the machines and workers were in place, production could begin, and planned to produce 93 types of products in the third quarter of this year. Soviet experts advised us that rushing into mass production without mastering the technology would inevitably lead to massive equipment damage and frustrate workers' enthusiasm for mastering new technologies, which would cause serious losses to the country. Facts proved that the experts' advice was absolutely correct. Since we started mastering new production in June, we have encountered many unexpected difficulties. The drill bit workshop, which was the first to begin mastering new production, found that the edges of the first products milled by the automatic milling machine were chipped off and did not look like drill bits at all. The workshop director, engineers, section chiefs, and foremen held countless meetings and studied and adjusted day and night for more than a month before the first semi-automatic milling machine was able to operate normally. Machine tools that Soviet experts could adjust in just a few minutes often took our workers, even engineering and technical personnel, a week to adjust properly. A machine called an "automatic centerless grinder" ground things out of round because the thing being ground was uneven. Just to find this one fault, the workshop director and technicians spent more than ten days. Even now, many machine tool workers still cannot operate the machines.

    The facts of the past few months have told us that new technologies and methods armed with advanced Soviet science are absolutely incompatible with our past backward experience and old habits. To learn the entire new production process, we must abandon the "old experience" that is no longer applicable. However, changing workers' old habits and old methods is a profound process of struggle between new and old ideas, new and old habits, and cannot be done in a day or two. To give a very common example: in existing general machine factories, workers are accustomed to using old-style machine tools. These machine tools do not have a coolant supply system, so workers have no choice but to use a small brush to dip oil from a bowl and smear it on the workpiece. In front of machine tools with automatic oil-pouring cooling equipment, workers still follow their old habits, using a broken bowl to hold oil and cooling it with a smear. Soviet experts were very surprised to see this phenomenon. Why not use excellent automatic equipment but prefer those broken oil bowls? When asked, the workers replied: We can't say ourselves, we're just used to it. After several criticisms, some workers still secretly used them. After two months of education in the tool and repair workshop, repeated criticism from experts and the workshop director, and finally an order confiscating the oil bowls, the old habits were completely overcome.

    The Party's ideological work must repeatedly struggle against all old habits and old ideas. Special attention should be paid to educating veteran workers, because bad old habits and old experiences are deeply rooted in them. In the beginning, workers have not fully mastered new methods and technologies, and on the surface, it seems that new methods and technologies are not as good as the old ones, which makes it easier to foster conservative ideas and empiricism among workers. For example, the efficiency of the automatic cutting machine in the material preparation workshop is twice as high as that of the small hexagonal lathe. At first, the workers were very enthusiastic, thinking that the automatic machine tool was fast and light, but when they started operating it, the lathe was often stuck and unable to move due to unfamiliarity with the technology, and the cutting capacity was only one-tenth of that of the small hexagonal lathe. Some workers suspected and did not want to operate the automatic machine tool. In practice, we use examples to educate workers and prove to them the superiority of the new technology. This kind of education makes it easiest for workers to be convinced and inspires their enthusiasm and confidence in learning new technologies.

    Our cadres are also only familiar with old equipment and old habits and are equally unfamiliar with and lack confidence in mastering new methods and new equipment. When workers doubt new equipment and new methods (especially in order to complete production tasks), they often accommodate and sympathize with workers' conservative emotions. There is such an example in the tool workshop. When workers were making screw milling cutters, the expert suggested using a relieving lathe instead of a screw grinder, and everyone "agreed" at the time. But after the expert left, the workers went to the foreman, and the foreman went to the director, believing that they had always used screw grinders in the past and had never heard of using relieving lathes, and said that they were not sure about using relieving lathes. The director, eager to rush out products, agreed to the workers' use of screw grinders. Some people replace new technologies with handicraft methods and say they are "finding tricks." This delays the time for workers to master new technologies, fragments the process regulations based on the advanced scientific and technological experience of the Soviet Union, and makes it impossible to guarantee quality. We strictly criticized this accommodation of conservative emotions and ideas and commended those cadres who resolutely supported new things.

    The vast majority of workers are very enthusiastic about mastering new technologies. As long as we strengthen their ideological education, they can humbly learn and make rapid progress. In the workshop, we can see three or five workers studying new technologies together everywhere. And many outstanding people have also emerged, such as Zhou Qishu, an adjuster in the drill bit workshop, who was completely ignorant of automatic machine tools at the beginning, but after three months of hard study, he has been able to initially master them independently. Yu Dexiu, a worker in the tool workshop, although his technical level is not high, has mastered the operation of the precision boring machine in a month and a half because he humbly learned from Soviet experts. Wang Enyan, a worker in the forging workshop, worked hard to solve the most difficult welding of small drill bits and won a quality excellence award.

    Currently, factory-wide technical learning is underway. We have Soviet experts in various fields, which is an extremely favorable condition. We have selected excellent technicians and foremen to follow experts to learn in order to train our own new-type technicians. At the same time, we are holding twelve advanced technician training classes and four technical personnel training classes, taught by Soviet experts. The head of the expert team teaches factory management courses to the factory director, Party committee secretary, etc.

    Under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, we are confident that we can raise our current technical level to a new level. (Attached picture)

    努力掌握新技术
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂办公室
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂是以苏联最先进的技术和苏联头等机械设备装备起来的，其中有些设备是一九五四年出品的第一号。产品品种规格繁多，仅刃具的规格即达二千余种。精密度要求极其严格，例如最小的钻头（一种产品）还没有一根猪毛粗（直径零点二五公厘），最精密的量规公差不能超过一根头发粗的千分之一（十万分之七公厘）。因此，要掌握这样一个精密的工厂的生产，就必须具有高度的技术水平和管理水平。
    我们现有的技术水平远远不能满足这个新型工厂的要求。我们的工人、技术人员、管理人员所熟悉的都是一些旧式机床和比较普通的产品，在新的设备、新的产品、新的加工方法和管理制度前面感到很生疏。我们有一位有三十三年工龄的量规车间主任，他在量规工段里只能认出两台机床的名字，很多机床都没见过。在开始的时候，我们没有一位能调整自动机床和半自动机床的工人。按原设计的要求，全厂技术工人的平均水平应为四点五级，但实际上，像钻头车间，一、二级的工人就占百分之八十。
    技术落后已经成为转入正常生产的最大障碍，努力提高现有的技术水平就成为全厂职工当前最迫切最严重的任务了。
    起初，我们对掌握新技术的困难和复杂性的认识是极其不足的，有的同志认为盖好房子，有了机器和工人，就可以投入生产，计划在今年第三季度就出九十三种产品。苏联专家劝我们说：没掌握好技术就急于大量出产品，势必大量破损设备，并挫折工人掌握新技术的热情，这将给国家带来严重的损失。事实证明专家的意见一点不错。我们自六月份开始掌握新生产以来，遇到许多意想不到的困难。最早投入掌握新生产的钻头车间，自动铣床第一次铣出来的产品，边都括掉了，一点不像钻头。车间主任、工程师、工段长、工长不知开了多少会，日日夜夜地研究调整了一个多月，才使第一部半自动铣床正常开动起来。苏联专家只需几分钟就能调整好的机床，我们的工人、甚至工程技术人员往往一个星期都调整不好。一种叫“自动无心磨床”的机器磨出的东西不圆，原因是托磨的东西不平，仅仅为了找这一个毛病，车间主任和技术员就花了十多天时间。直到现在，还有不少机床工人还不能开动。
    几个月来的事实告诉我们：以苏联先进科学武装起来的新技术新方法，跟我们过去落后的经验和老习惯绝不相容；要学习整套新生产，必须抛弃已不适用的“老经验”。但是要改变工人的老习惯和旧方法，却是一个极深刻的新思想同旧思想斗争、新习惯同旧习惯斗争的过程，不是一天两天就能做好的。举一个最普通的例子：在现有的一般机器厂里，工人们都用惯了旧式机床；这种机床没有冷却液供给系统，因此工人不能不用一个小刷子在碗里蘸油涂抹加工物。在具有自动浇油的冷却设备的机床面前，工人们还沿用以往习惯，弄了个破碗盛油，
  一涂一抹进行冷却。苏联专家看到这种现象非常惊奇，为什么有优良的自动设备不用而却偏爱那些破油碗呢？问工人，工人回答：我们自己也说不上，只是一向用惯了。几经批评以后，有的工人还偷偷摸摸着使用。在工具和修配车间教育了两个月，专家、车间主任一再批评，最后并下令没收油碗，才完全克服了旧的习惯。
    党的思想工作必须反复地跟一切旧习惯、旧思想进行斗争。尤其特别注意对老工人进行教育，因为不良的旧习惯、老经验在他们身上是根深蒂固的。在开始的时候，工人还没有完全掌握新的方法和技术，从表面上看，似乎新方法、新技术还不如老的好，这样就更容易助长工人中的保守思想和经验主义的滋长。例如备料车间的自动切料机的效力比小六角车床大一倍，最初工人热情很高，以为自动机床既快又轻巧，但开始操作时，因技术不熟练，车床转转就被卡住不动了，切料能力只及小六角车床的十分之一，有的工人就怀疑，不想操纵自动机床。在实践中，我们就以实例来教育工人，给他们证明新技术的优越性。这种教育最易使工人口服心服，并启发他们学习新技术的热情和信心。
    我们的干部也只熟悉旧设备、旧习惯，对掌握新方法、新设备，同样是陌生的和缺乏信心的。当工人怀疑新设备、新方法（特别是为了完成生产任务）的时候，往往迁就和同情工人的守旧情绪。工具车间就有这样的例子，工人在作螺丝铣刀时，专家建议用铲床而不用螺丝磨床，当时大家都“同意”了。但专家走后工人就找工长，工长找主任，认为过去都是用螺丝磨床，没听说过用铲床，并说用铲床做没有把握，主任为急于赶出产品就同意了工人使用螺丝磨床。有的人以手工业的办法来代替新技术，并说是“找窍门”。这样就推延工人掌握新技术的时间，使以苏联先进科学技术经验为基础的工艺规程变得支离破碎，使质量得不到保证。我们严格批评了这种迁就守旧情绪和思想，表扬那些坚决支持新事物的干部。
    绝大部分工人非常热衷于掌握新技术。只要加强对他们的思想教育，他们就能虚心苦学，进步很快。在车间，我们到处可以看到三个五个的工人在一起研究新技术。而且也出现了许多出色的人物，如钻头车间调整工周启述，开始时对自动机床完全无知，经过三个月的苦心钻研已能初步独立掌握。工具车间工人于德修，技术水平虽然不高，但由于虚心向苏联专家学习，一个半月的时间就掌握了精密镗床的操作。锻工车间工人王恩言艰苦钻研，解决了最难焊接的小钻头的焊接，并且得到了质量优秀奖。
    目前全厂性的技术学习正在进行。我们有各方面的苏联专家，这是极为有利的条件。我们选择了优秀的技术员和工长专门跟随专家学习，以培养自己的新型技师。同时举办十二个高级技工训练班和四个技术人员训练班，由苏联专家教课。由专家组长向厂长、党委书记等讲授工厂管理的课程。
    在苏联专家具体的指导下，我们有信心把我们现有的技术水平提高到一个新的水平上来。（附图片）
