Guangzhou Labor Model Wang Shengbao's Letter to Soviet Workers

Dear Soviet Worker Comrades:

    The Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué has been published. It fully proves that the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been further consolidated, and the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has been further developed.

    Soviet advanced experience has been of great help to me. In the first year after liberation, with the assistance of engineers, I applied Soviet advanced experience and repaired a 15,000-kilowatt turbine in a relatively short period, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Since then, it has aroused my interest in learning from Soviet advanced experience. The year before last, I learned the Soviet combined installation method and repaired a turbine that would have originally taken half a year to repair in 54 days. Under the guidance and encouragement of the Party, and with the assistance of the working masses, I found old materials in the warehouse, pieced them together, and installed a new turbine, ensuring that the people had sufficient electricity and that the production of various factories could proceed normally. When supporting the Zhengzhou Power Plant, Soviet experts gave me many instructions, which made me understand the importance of mobilizing employees to put forward rationalization proposals and made me realize the great responsibility of training young workers.

    As the great October Socialist Revolution Day approaches, we sincerely thank you for your friendly assistance. We are determined to further learn from Soviet advanced experience, ensure safe power generation, strive to reduce coal consumption, carry out labor emulation, and improve labor productivity. We hail the further development of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and we hail the new contributions made by China and the Soviet Union to defend peace.

    Guangzhou Labor Model
    Deputy Director of the Power Plant of the Guangzhou Electric Power Bureau Wang Shengbao

    广州市劳动模范王生保给苏联工人的信亲爱的苏联工人同志：
    中苏会谈公报发表了。它充分证明了中苏两国牢不可破的友谊已更加巩固，中苏两国的密切合作已更加发展了。
    苏联先进经验对我的帮助是很大的。在解放后的第一年，我在工程师的协助下，运用了苏联先进经验，在较短的时间内，把一万五千瓩的透平机修好了，替国家创造了大量的财富。从此就引起我学习苏联先进经验的兴趣。前年我学了苏联的合组安装法，又把一架本来要半年时间才能修好的透平机，用五十四天时间修好了。在党的教导和鼓舞下，在工人群众的协助下，我在仓库里找到旧料，东补西凑，又安装了一部新的透平机，保证了人民有充分的电力使用，各工厂生产能正常进行。在支援郑州发电厂的时候，苏联专家给了我许多指示，使我懂得了发动职工提出合理化建议的重要意义，使我认识到培养青年工人的重大责任。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命节来临的时候，我们衷心地感谢你们的友谊帮助。我们决心进一步学习苏联先进经验，保证安全发电，努力降低煤耗，开展劳动竞赛，提高劳动生产率。我们欢呼中苏两国友好关系的进一步发展，欢呼中苏两国为保卫和平而作出新的贡献。
