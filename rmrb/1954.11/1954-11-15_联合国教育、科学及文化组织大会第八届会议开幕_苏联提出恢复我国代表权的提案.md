Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, November 14th: The eighth session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference opened on the 12th in Montevideo, Uruguay. Representatives from seventy-two countries are participating in the meeting.

The President of the Conference, the head of the Indian delegation, Radhakrishnan, on behalf of the member states, expressed satisfaction with the participation of the Soviet representatives in the work of the organization, because the participation of the Soviet representatives makes this organization more representative. He pointed out that in the recent period, the international situation has improved to a certain extent, as evidenced by the cessation of the Korean War, the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and other issues. He expressed regret that despite some easing of international tensions, the People's Republic of China still does not have a representative participating in the United Nations. He concluded by saying that our task is to end the "Cold War" and ease international tensions.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Stoletov, then spoke, emphasizing the need to resolve the issue of China's representation in UNESCO and its institutions. He pointed out that it is abnormal that the great People's Republic of China, with its long history of culture and playing a major role in solving international problems together with other major powers, still does not have a representative in this organization, and the seat of China's legitimate representative is still occupied by the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been forever spurned by the Chinese people. He pointed out that the correct resolution of the issue of China's representation in this organization would be in the interests of peace-loving people of all countries and in accordance with the principles and standards of international law, and would be a major contribution to the development of international cooperation in science, culture and education.

The Soviet representative then put forward the following proposal: "The Conference, having considered the recommendation of the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics regarding the non-recognition of the credentials of the representatives of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique at the eighth plenary session of the UNESCO General Conference, resolves: to consider the credentials of the representatives of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek clique invalid."

The Soviet proposal was supported by the representatives of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. The Kuomintang elements opposed it. The United States representative moved that the issue of expelling the Kuomintang elements from UNESCO not be discussed at this session. When this issue was put to a vote, the Soviet proposal was defeated by a vote of forty-one to six.

    联合国教育、科学及文化组织大会第八届会议开幕
    苏联提出恢复我国代表权的提案
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚讯：联合国教育、科学及文化组织大会第八届会议十二日在乌拉圭的蒙得维的亚开幕。参加会议的有七十二个国家的代表。
    会议主席、印度代表团团长拉德哈克里希南代表各成员国对苏联代表参加这个组织的工作表示满意，因为苏联代表的参加使这个组织更具有代表性。他指出，在最近一个时期，国际局势有了一定的改进，这表现在朝鲜战争的停止、印度支那问题和其他问题的和平解决上。他表示遗憾说，尽管国际紧张局势有了一些缓和，中华人民共和国仍然没有代表参加联合国。他最后说，我们的任务就是结束“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势。
    苏联代表团团长斯托列托夫接着发言，他强调指出解决中国在教育、科学及文化组织及其机构中的代表权问题的必要性。他指出，拥有悠久的文化、在解决国际问题上同其他大国一道发挥着重大作用的伟大的中华人民共和国在这个组织中还没有代表，中国合法代表的席位仍然被中国人民已永远唾弃的国民党蒋介石集团分子窃据着，这种现象是不正常的。他指出，正确解决中国在这个组织中的代表权问题将符合各国爱好和平人民的利益以及国际法的原则和标准，将是对于发展科学、文化和教育方面的国际合作的重大贡献。
    苏联代表接着提出了以下提案：“会议在考虑了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟代表团提出的关于不承认国民党蒋介石集团代表在联合国教育、科学及文化组织大会第八届全体会议上的证书的建议以后，决议：认为国民党蒋介石集团代表的证书无效。”
    苏联提案得到捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和匈牙利代表的支持。国民党分子反对。美国代表动议在本届会议上不讨论把国民党分子驱逐出联合国教育、科学及文化组织问题。当这个问题交付表决时，苏联提案以四十一票对六票被否决。
