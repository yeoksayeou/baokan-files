Xinxian Special District Achieves Bumper Harvest of Oil Crops

The 570,000 mu of oil crops in Xinxian Special District, Shanxi Province, have generally achieved a bumper harvest, with an average increase of over 19% compared to last year. The sunflowers planted on over 1,600 mu in Daixian County this year are growing very well, with an average yield of 200 jin per mu. The total sunflower production in the county this year is expected to reach over 300,000 jin. Farmers in Xingxian and Hequ counties, who were not accustomed to growing sunflowers in the past, have achieved bumper harvests from the sunflowers they trialed planting this year on the edges of fields and around houses, creating conditions for increasing sunflower planting next year. Currently, the broad masses of farmers are actively threshing and drying various oil crops, preparing to sell them to the state. Daixian and Fanshi counties have already sold over 1.1 million jin of various oil crops to the state. (Ren Ziming)

    忻县专区油料作物丰收
    山西省忻县专区五十七万余亩油料作物普遍丰收。平均比去年增产百分之十九以上。代县今年种的一千六百多亩葵花，生长的十分良好，每亩平均产二百斤。全县今年的葵花总产量可达三十多万斤。兴县、河曲等县农民过去不习惯种葵花，今年利用地边屋旁空地试种的葵花都得到丰收，给明年增种葵花创造了条件。目前，广大农民正在积极打、晒各种油料，准备出售给国家。代县、繁峙两县已卖给国家各种油料一百一十多万斤。  （任子明）
