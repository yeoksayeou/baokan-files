The visit and performances of the Soviet State Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre (referred to as the Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre) to our country opened on the 3rd of this month at the Tianqiao Grand Theatre in Beijing.

The Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre is one of the most prestigious artistic groups in the Soviet Union. During its visit to Beijing, it will successively perform six famous dramas, including the operas "The Storm," "Eugene Onegin," the comic opera "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube," the ballets "Swan Lake," "Notre Dame de Paris," and the fairy tale ballet "Doctor Aybolit." These brilliant performances will have a tremendous educational significance and profound impact on our country's audiences and the musical drama art world.

The opera "The Storm" profoundly depicts the scene of sharp class struggle during the Russian Civil War, revealing the deeply ingrained power of Lenin's thought. The musical songs are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and the lyrical flavor of Russian folk songs.

The above picture is a scene from "The Storm." Peasant representatives come to Lenin seeking the truth, and Lenin warmly receives them.

The picture on the right is a scene from "The Storm." Under the call of the Provincial Committee, the guerrillas, led by Communist Party member Listrat, immediately depart from their village for the dense forest.

The opera "Eugene Onegin" is an opera composed by Tchaikovsky based on the verse novel by the great Russian poet Pushkin. In his work, Pushkin shaped the typical Russian intellectual of the 19th century – the "superfluous man" – during a period when the Russian serf system was nearing its collapse and a new society had not yet been established. In the opera, Tchaikovsky extensively used the melodies of Russian folk love songs, and as the plot develops, the music uses symphonic melodies to profoundly depict the inner activities of the characters.

The above picture is a scene from "Eugene Onegin" at a ball in St. Petersburg.

The opera "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube" is one of the excellent musical works of various nationalities performed by the Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre. The opera tells the story of the Zaporozhets (Ukrainian immigrants) who were forced to move to Turkey as serfs in the 17th century. Because of their loyalty to their motherland, they stubbornly resisted the Turks, and people constantly sneaked back to their country. After many heroic and ingenious struggles, the Zaporozhets finally gained the freedom to return to their motherland completely. The opera's music is permeated with the melodies of Ukrainian folk songs and is full of enthusiasm and healthy humor.

The picture on the left is a scene of the Zaporozhets writing a mocking letter to the Turkish emperor.

The fairy tale ballet "Doctor Aybolit" tells the story of the benevolent Doctor Aybolit, the Young Pioneers Daniechka, Vanechka, and their friends – birds and animals – who succeeded in their arduous struggle against evil. This ballet uses an engaging fairy tale form to show the victory of profound humanitarian ideas, collectivism, comradely love, and friendship over shameful jealousy, selfishness, and misanthropy.

The above picture is a scene from "Doctor Aybolit."

The ballet "Notre Dame de Paris" is adapted from the famous novel by French writer Victor Hugo. Through the story of Esmeralda, a sincere and innocent girl, being sentenced to death, the novel denounces the darkness, terror, and the insidious brutality and licentiousness of priests and the like in the "holy church" of the Middle Ages, and also exposes the frivolousness and egoism of aristocratic figures.

The above picture is a scene from "Notre Dame de Paris."
The ballet "Swan Lake" is a world-famous and outstanding classical Russian ballet, and its music is the work of the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky's genius. The story is based on an ancient legend of the Russian people: the maiden Odette was transformed into a swan by the evil sorcerer Rothbart using magic. But because of her and Prince Siegfried's sincere love, and their fearless self-sacrificing struggle against evil forces, they finally overcome death and evil. Odette regained her human form and began a happy life with Siegfried.

    苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院的演出
    苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院〈简称苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院）来我国的访问演出，本月三日在北京天桥大剧场开幕了。
    苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院是苏联最负有盛誉的艺术团体之一。它要在访问北京期间陆续演出的，有歌剧“暴风雨”、“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”，喜歌剧“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”，巴蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”、“巴黎圣母院”，童话巴蕾舞剧“阿伊波利特医生”等六个著名戏剧。这些光辉的演出，对我国观众和音乐戏剧艺术界，是有巨大的教育意义和深刻的影响的。
    歌剧“暴风雨”，深刻地描画了俄国国内战争时期尖锐的阶级斗争的情景，揭示了深入人心的列宁思想的力量。歌曲音乐洋溢着革命热情和俄国民间歌曲的抒情风味。
    上图是“暴风雨”的一个场面。农民代表为了寻找真理来找列宁，列宁亲切地接待农民。
    右图是“暴风雨”的一个场面。在省委的号召下，以共产党员李斯德拉特为首的游击队立刻从自己的村庄里开向茂密的森林里去。
    歌剧“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”是柴可夫斯基根据俄国伟大诗人普希金的诗体小说编剧和作曲的歌剧。普希金在他的作品里塑造了十九世纪俄国农奴制度接近崩溃、新社会又还未建立起来时期的俄国知识分子——“多余的人”的典型。在歌剧中，柴可夫斯基广泛利用了俄国民间情歌的音调，随着剧情的发展，乐曲用交响式的旋律深刻描写出角色的内心活动。
    上图是“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”在彼得堡舞会上的一个场面。
    左图是“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”中的奥涅金和妲姬雅娜。歌剧“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”是苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院上演的各民族优秀音乐作品之一。歌剧叙述的是十七世纪被强迫迁居到土耳其作农奴的萨坡罗什人（乌克兰移民）因忠于祖国，顽强地反抗土耳其人，不断有人偷渡回国。经过许多英勇、机智的斗争，萨坡罗什人终于得到了全部返回祖国的自由。歌剧的音乐浸透着乌克兰民歌的音调，并充满热情和健康的幽默。
    左图是萨坡罗什人在给土耳其皇帝写嘲笑信的场面。
    童话舞剧“阿伊波利特医生”是叙述仁慈的阿伊波利特医生、少先队员达涅契卡、瓦涅契卡和他们的朋友——飞禽走兽——在反对邪恶的艰苦斗争中获得了成功的故事。这个舞剧用引人入胜的童话形式，显示了深刻的人道主义思想、集体主义、同志爱和友谊对于可耻的嫉妒、利己主义和仇视人类的行为的胜利。
    上图是“阿伊波利特医生”的一个场面。
    舞剧“巴黎圣母院”是根据法国作家雨果的著名小说改编的。小说通过一个真诚纯洁的无辜的少女——爱斯米拉尔达被判处死刑的故事，控诉了中世纪“神圣教堂”里的黑暗、恐怖和神父之类人物的阴险残暴、荒淫无耻，也揭露了贵族阶级人物的轻佻浮薄和利己主义。
    上图是“巴黎圣母院”的一个场面。
  巴蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”是世界著名的俄罗斯最优秀的古典舞剧，它的音乐是俄罗斯伟大作曲家柴可夫斯基的天才作品。故事取材于俄国人民的一个古老的传说：少女奥杰塔被恶魔罗特巴尔特用妖法变成了天鹅。但是由于她和王子齐格弗里德的真诚的爱情，和他们不怕自我牺牲的对于恶势力的斗争，他们终于战胜了死、战胜了恶。奥杰塔恢复了人形，和齐格弗里德开始了欢乐的生活。
