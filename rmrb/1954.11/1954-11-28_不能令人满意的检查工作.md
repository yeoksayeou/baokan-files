    Struggle Against the Phenomenon of Irresponsible Handling of Letters from the People

    Unsatisfactory Inspection Work

    In mid-May of this year, Zheng Tongjie, head of the Planning Section of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation's Transportation Bureau, led a work team (six people) to the Shangrao Repair Factory with the task of inspecting the Shangrao Repair Factory's labor organization adjustment and diesel vehicle quality issues. The work team's first five days at the factory coincided with the factory's employee representative meeting; however, the work team did not seize this good opportunity to understand the situation, only occasionally attending a few meetings. After the meeting, the work team took several diesel vehicles to Nanping, Fujian, claiming to conduct an actual inspection of the quality of the diesel vehicles along the way, but in reality, they did not inquire about the situation from the drivers along the way. After returning, they made a report to the Transportation Bureau that did not fully match the actual situation, thus ending this inspection work that took more than ten days and covered more than a thousand kilometers.

    Readers Xiang Zhen and Chu Fei sent a letter to this newspaper criticizing such an "unsatisfactory" work team. At that time, the readers' letters group of this newspaper asked the Party Branch Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation's Transportation Bureau to check the facts.

    Soon, the Transportation Bureau's Party Branch sent an inspection material from the Supervision Section, reflecting that the work team had done a lot of work: the number of times they participated in the factory's employee representative meeting discussions was still relatively high, and they also inquired about the situation of the diesel vehicles at any time on the way back and forth from Shangrao to Nanping..., therefore this inspection had certain achievements and was still "satisfactory". Finally, the material mentioned the shortcomings of the work team in passing, without conducting any analysis or criticism.

    We then sent this material, along with the reader's letter of criticism, to the Party Branch of the Shangrao Repair Factory for research. The factory's Party Branch organized an inspection team, inquired about the situation from relevant personnel scattered in various places, conducted research at the branch committee meeting, and then gave this newspaper a responsible reply.

    Let's compare the Transportation Bureau's Supervision Section's inspection material with the Shangrao Repair Factory's Party Branch's reply!

    Was the work team's participation in the factory's employee representative meeting discussions relatively high? The reply is: "The work team rarely participated in discussions, only individual comrades (Gao Xu) participated more often."

    Did the work team inquire about the situation of the diesel vehicles at any time on the way back and forth from Shangrao to Nanping? The reply is: "Section Chief Zheng took a diesel vehicle from Shangrao to Jian'ou and did not talk to the driver; when the diesel vehicle arrived at Jian'ou station and the tire leaked and could not drive, Section Chief Zheng did not ask what the reason was, jumped into another gasoline vehicle and rushed to Nanping, and returned to Shangrao on the third day."

    What was the result of the work team's inspection? The reply said: When they left, they talked vaguely about some views on diesel vehicles, some of which did not conform to the actual situation; they were also unwilling to listen to some of the factory comrades' opinions on diesel vehicles.

    In general, "no problems were solved at all".

    The facts are already very clear: the work of the work team was not "satisfactory"; moreover, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation's Transportation Bureau's Party Branch and Supervision Section's inspection of the work team's work was also unsatisfactory.

### 不能令人满意的检查工作

专栏：向不负责处理来信的现象作斗争

    不能令人满意的检查工作
    今年五月中旬，江西省交通厅运输局计划科长郑同杰率领一个工作组（六个人）来到了上饶修理厂，任务是检查上饶修理厂劳动组织的调整问题和柴油车的质量问题。工作组下厂的头五天，正好厂里开职工代表大会；但是工作组并没有抓住这个好机会来了解情况，只是偶尔参加几次会议。会议结束后，工作组分乘几辆柴油车到福建南平去，说是要沿途实际检查柴油车的质量，但实际上沿途并没有向司机了解什么情况。回去以后，他们向运输局作了一个同实际情况不尽相符的汇报，就结束了这次费时十多天、往返一千多公里的检查工作。
    读者向真、除非给本报来信批评了这样一个
  “不能令人满意”的工作组。当时，本报读者来信组就请江西省交通厅运输局党支部书记代为查对事实。
    不久，运输局党支部寄来了监察科的一个检查材料，反映工作组曾做了不少工作：参加厂里职工代表大会讨论的次数还是较多的，在往返上饶、南平的途中也随时查问了柴油车的情况……，因此这次检查有一定成绩，还能“令人满意”。末了，材料里捎带提了一下工作组的缺点，没有进行任何的分析批判。
    我们又把这个材料连同读者的批评信一起寄请上饶修理厂的党支部研究。厂里的党支部组织了一个检查组，向分散在各地的有关人员了解情况，在支委会上进行了研究，然后给了本报一个负责的答复。
    让我们把运输局监察科的检查材料和上饶修理厂党支部的答复比较一下吧！
    工作组参加厂里职工代表大会的讨论次数是较多的吗？答复是：“工作组很少参加讨论，只是个别同志（高旭）参加次数较多。”
    工作组在往返上饶、南平的途中随时了解柴油车的情况吗？答复是：“郑科长从上饶乘柴油车到建瓯，就没找司机谈过话；柴油车到建瓯站轮胎泄气，不能行驶了，郑科长也不问是什么原因，跳上另一辆汽油车就赶往南平去，第三天又回了上饶。”
    工作组检查结果怎样呢？答复中说：他们临走时笼统地谈了一些对柴油车的看法，其中还有一些不符合实际情况的地方；厂里同志对柴油车的一些意见，他们也不愿倾听。
    总的说来，“根本没有解决什么问题”。
    事实已经很明显，工作组的工作是不能“令人满意”的；而且，运输局党支部和监察科对工作组工作情况的检查也是不能令人满意的。
