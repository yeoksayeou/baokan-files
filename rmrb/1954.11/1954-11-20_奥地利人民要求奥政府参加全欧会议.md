Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: According to TASS, the Soviet government's proposal to convene a Pan-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system has generated widespread response among the Austrian people.

    The leading body of the Austrian Democratic League passed a resolution at its meeting on the 16th stating: In view of the current tense international situation, Austria must welcome the method suggested in the Soviet note to reach a genuine and lasting agreement on outstanding European issues, including the German peace treaty and the Austrian peace treaty. The resolution emphasized that the Austrian government should participate in the conference proposed by the Soviet government.

    Peace advocates in Vienna met to discuss the Soviet government's note. Professor Brandweiner, chairman of the Austrian Peace Council, emphasized at the meeting that the London and Paris agreements seriously threaten the security and peace of our country. Austria's vital interests require the Austrian government to accept the Soviet proposal without delay and declare its agreement to participate in the Pan-European conference. "The Austrian People's Voice" emphasized in an editorial that the Soviet proposal has a great impact on European countries. The newspaper said: In the 1930s, Western countries rejected the Soviet proposal to establish a collective security system, hoping that the spearhead of the Hitler regime would point eastward. Austria still feels the consequences of this policy even now. The newspaper pointed out that German militarism is an obstacle to Austria's restoration of full sovereignty; and that major powers reaching a consensus on the issue of a Pan-European collective security system is the only opportunity to resolve the Austrian question.

    奥地利人民要求奥政府参加全欧会议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社报道：苏联政府要求召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议在奥地利人民中间引起了广泛的反响。
    奥地利民主联盟领导机构在十六日举行的会议上通过了一项决议说：鉴于目前国际关系中的紧张局势，奥地利必须欢迎苏联照会中建议的方法，去就欧洲悬而未决的问题，包括对德和约和对奥和约问题在内，达成真正而持久的协议。这项决议着重指出：奥地利政府应参加苏联政府建议的会议。
    维也纳的和平拥护者开会讨论了苏联政府的照会。奥地利和平理事会主席布兰德魏纳教授在会上着重指出：伦敦和巴黎协定严重地威胁着我们国家的安全和和平。奥地利的切身利益要求奥地利政府毫不拖延地接受苏联的建议，并且宣布同意参加全欧会议。“奥地利人民之声报”在社论里着重指出：苏联的建议对欧洲各国影响很大。这家报纸说：在三十年代，西方国家拒绝了苏联的建立集体安全体系的建议，而希望希特勒政权的矛头会指向东方。奥地利甚至现在还感觉到这种政策的后果。这家报纸指出：德国军国主义是奥地利恢复充分主权的障碍；而各大国在全欧集体安全体系问题上得出一致意见，是解决奥地利问题的唯一机会。
