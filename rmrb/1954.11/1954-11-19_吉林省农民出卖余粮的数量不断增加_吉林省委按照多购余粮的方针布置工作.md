    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Farmers in Jilin Province are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state. By November 15th, the province's grain purchasing stations had already purchased 237,430 tons of surplus grain.
    Grain production in seventeen cities and counties in Jilin Province exceeded that of last year. Thirty-one cities and counties suffered from natural disasters such as floods and frost, and their production was less than last year. However, the province's total grain production is still roughly at the same level as last year. Soon after the autumn harvest began, farmers began selling their surplus grain to the state. After Wu Fengqi, chairman of the Shuguang Collective Farm in Hailong County, returned to the farm after attending the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the farm members discussed and decided that all surplus grain, except for agricultural tax, seeds, and rations, would be sold to the state by the farm collectively. The farm has now distributed the corn and has already sold more than 14,000 jin of surplus corn to the state. In Hejia Village, Eleventh District, Yushu County, the "May 1st" and "November 1st" agricultural production cooperatives, which use tractors for cultivation, generally harvested 1,000 to 2,000 jin more grain per mu than the local average. These two agricultural production cooperatives plan to sell 370,000 jin of surplus grain to the state this year. While threshing, the members of the "November 1st" agricultural production cooperative sent the golden soybeans to the state grain station. In five days, they sent 160,000 jin. From October 5th to November 3rd, farmers in Tonghua County sold more than 820 tons of surplus grain to the state, which is one-third more than the amount of grain stored in the same period last year. In Jiutai County, five or six hundred carts go to the grain station to sell surplus grain every day, and farmers sell more than 500 tons of surplus grain every day. From the time the new grain entered the market to November 12th, the county had purchased more than 11,200 tons of surplus grain.
    Due to the enthusiastic sale of surplus grain to the state by the vast number of farmers, the amount of surplus grain purchased by grain stations in various places is increasing day by day. In early October, the province's grain purchasing stations purchased a total of 8,542 tons of surplus grain; in mid-October, they purchased 16,474 tons; in late October, they purchased 31,683 tons. In early November, the province's grain purchase volume increased to 78,250 tons, and on November 15th alone, they purchased 14,801 tons.
    In order to better carry out the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a rural work conference from October 28th to November 4th. In addition to studying winter production and disaster relief, the conference specifically discussed and deployed the unified purchase and sale of grain in the spirit of purchasing more surplus grain. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to do a good job in purchasing more surplus grain on the basis of production relief and implementation of the grain purchase policy. At present, various counties are holding three-level cadre meetings to convey and implement the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Conference.

    吉林省农民出卖余粮的数量不断增加
    吉林省委按照多购余粮的方针布置工作
    【本报讯】吉林省农民正踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。到十一月十五日，全省粮食收购栈已经收购余粮二十三万七千四百三十吨。
    吉林省今年有十七个市、县粮食产量超过去年，三十一个市、县因遭受水、霜等自然灾害，产量不及去年，但全省粮食产量仍大体接近去年的水平。秋收开始不久，农民们就陆续向国家出售余粮。海龙县曙光集体农庄的庄员们，在农庄主席吴凤岐参加第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议回到农庄以后，就讨论决定除农业税、种籽、口粮等外，所剩余粮都由农庄统一卖给国家。现在这个农庄已经分配完苞米，同时已经把一万四千多斤多余的苞米卖给国家。榆树县第十一区何家村用拖拉机耕作的“五一”、“十一”两个农业生产合作社，今年庄稼的收成普遍超过当地一般产量一千斤到两千斤。这两个农业生产合作社计划今年要卖给国家三十七万斤余粮。“十一”农业生产合作社的社员们一边打场，一边把黄澄澄的大豆送到国家粮栈，五天的时间便送出十六万斤。通化县农民从十月五日到十一月三日，已经卖给国家余粮八百二十多吨，比去年同时期粮食入库数量多三分之一。九台县现在每天都有五、六百辆大车到粮栈卖余粮，每天农民出卖的余粮有五百多吨；全县从新粮登市到十一月十二日，已经收购一万一千二百多吨余粮。
    由于广大农民踊跃出卖余粮给国家，各地粮栈收购余粮数量日益增加。十月上旬，全省粮食收购栈共收购余粮八千五百四十二吨，十月中旬收购一万六千四百七十四吨，十月下旬收购三万一千六百八十三吨；十一月上旬，全省购粮数量增加到七万八千二百五十吨，而十一月十五日一天，就收购了一万四千八百零一吨。
    为了更好地做好粮食统购统销工作，中共吉林省委会在十月二十八日到十一月四日召开了农村工作会议。会议除研究了冬季生产和生产救灾等工作外，根据多购余粮的精神，专门讨论和布置了粮食统购统销工作。会议强调必须在生产救灾和贯彻购粮政策的基础上，做好多购余粮的工作。目前，各县正在召开三级干部会议，传达和贯彻省委农村工作会议的精神。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
