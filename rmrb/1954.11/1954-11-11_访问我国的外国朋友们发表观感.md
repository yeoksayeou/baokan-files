    Impressions of Foreign Friends Visiting China
    Delegation of the Japanese Chemical and Petroleum Workers' Union
    The delegation of the Japanese Chemical and Petroleum Workers' Union, led by Asano Shozo, consisting of five members, who came to China at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for a visit and tour, wrote a joint letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to bid farewell before leaving Beijing for the Soviet Union. The letter stated: "In the past ten days or so, we visited various industries and workers' welfare facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang. We express our respect for the great achievements made by China, and we are amazed at the great achievements made by China in such a short period of time after liberation. We are convinced that such achievements were made possible by the victory of the New Democratic Revolution.
    Due to the fact that American imperialists, in violation of the will of the Japanese people, are obstructing the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet returned to normal. We deeply feel that this unnatural state hinders the road to peace. In order to establish world peace, this situation must be changed quickly. We once again recognize that changing this situation is our obligation.
    Now, as we leave China, what we feel in our hearts is the friendship established in this short period of time, as well as the broad-mindedness and compassionate friendship of our Chinese comrades."
    Members of the British Delegation from All Circles
    According to reports in Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po": Three members of the British delegation from all circles visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries—British Labour Member of Parliament Mrs. Barbara Castle, Labour Member of Parliament Charles Royle, and Dr. Derek James, lecturer at University College London—met with reporters in Hong Kong on the 5th to express their impressions of their visit to China.
    Mrs. Castle first spoke about China's friendly wishes towards other countries, saying, "One impression we gained in China is that the new Chinese regime is very stable and willing to establish friendly relations with all countries." She said, "We were all moved by the Chinese government's obvious desire to increase relations with our country. We get the impression that China has a genuine desire to eliminate obstacles in Sino-British relations and further promote relations between China and the UK."
    Mrs. Castle also spoke about the construction achievements of the Chinese people. She said, "The scale of construction in China is very large. We were deeply impressed by the progress they have made in the construction of railways, houses, reservoirs, schools, hospitals, and other aspects."
    MP Royle and Dr. James also told reporters about the progress in China's urban construction, medical equipment, and hygiene. Royle said, "The Chinese people are doing many things that they have never done in their history."
    French Women's Delegation
    The French Women's Delegation, consisting of five members led by Mrs. Marielle Brunhes-Delamarre, president of the French National Movement for the Protection of Children, who came to China at the invitation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, left Beijing for home on October 28.
    Before leaving, the French Women's Delegation sent a letter to Cai Chang, President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. The letter began by saying, "Our Chinese friends patiently answered the countless questions we constantly raised in order to understand the situation, and organized various visits for us. This made us feel so close to each other and enabled us to see the achievements in all aspects with our own eyes."
    The letter continued: "We visited cities, villages, factories, schools, and clinics. The improvement of life in rural areas, the construction of new workers' residential areas, health work, and the large-scale struggle to eliminate illiteracy made us realize the magnitude of the reforms that have been completed and the profound significance of these reforms in seeking happiness for the people. In this lovely and beautiful country, we deeply feel that people are constantly concerned about giving everyone the opportunity to develop his best talents, skills, and physical strength. Everyone can acquire the most modern knowledge, while at the same time striving to respect and promote the heritage of the past.
    "The radiant faces of Chinese children and their kind greetings to us will forever remain in our memory and in our hearts. Their happiness and future are indeed a constant concern of all of China, and all of China is doing its best to take care of them.
    "We know the role that Chinese women play in these efforts and constructions. We came into contact with Chinese women in various jobs, and they reflected the remarkable changes in Chinese women. They are aware of their responsibilities and are enthusiastically completing their tasks."
    The letter concluded: "Throughout our journey, we always heard the Chinese people express their friendship to the French people and their deep desire for peace. This desire inspires the new China to move forward on the road of life with infinite courage and enthusiasm.
    "This meeting with Chinese women has deepened our mutual friendship. Therefore, we hope that in the near future, we will also be able to welcome representatives of Chinese women in France, and we hope that our exchanges can be a prelude to the establishment of friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and France. This will help strengthen the conditions for peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world. This is our deepest wish, because peace is our common well-being."
      Israeli Women Representatives
    Yona Golan and Sonia Lopata, two Israeli women representatives who came to China at the invitation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to visit, left Beijing by plane on the morning of the 4th to return to their country. While in Beijing, they participated in China's National Day celebrations and visited Beijing, Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Before leaving Beijing, they wrote letters to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, expressing their impressions of their visit to China. Yona Golan wrote: "Having the opportunity to visit China, its cities, villages, factories, mines, cultural institutions, schools, nurseries, sanatoriums, museums, historical sites and places of interest, and especially to meet its people, opens up a new perspective for everyone to understand the forces that play a role in human life and the development of human history. For everyone who embraces lofty and simple ideals, peace and friendship between all peoples, and the ideals of happiness and security for all mankind and their children, this is an advanced school.
    We understand that the main goals of the new China are national industrialization and agricultural collectivization.
    We have seen and understood how the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have liberated the enormous productive and creative forces of your great people, who for centuries have suffered from the abominable bondage and enslavement of imperialism and feudalism.
    We had the opportunity to meet your first female driver, Tian Guiying. We know she is the first but not the last. She symbolizes the broad and open road that the new China has opened up for all Chinese women to all production sectors and all forms of creation.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has educated and taught women to take advantage of these opportunities to exert their abilities for the betterment of their motherland and for the happiness of all mankind."
    Yona Golan concluded: "Back in my country, I will do my best to inform people of the great spectacle of China's liberation, and to inform them of the transformation and construction of the new life of the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party.
    The Chinese people are doing peaceful work, so world peace can be maintained."
    Sonia Lopata wrote: "I am honored to be a guest in your fascinating country. Now, six weeks of pleasant sightseeing have passed. I sincerely thank you for your warm hospitality. Everywhere we have visited and traveled, we have clearly seen the care given to mothers and children. Lovely and healthy children can be seen everywhere. We know that children, adults and old people are all learning. It can truly be said that everyone is learning, the whole nation is learning. Only five years ago, Chinese women had no rights and were in a miserable situation, but now this is no longer visible. Women serve as government ministers, town leaders, cooperative heads, middle and high school principals, hospital directors, train drivers, tractor drivers, electrical technicians, and so on. Everywhere, women enjoy equal rights with men. This is the wish of women all over the world. We have seen newly built buildings in Beijing and elsewhere: middle schools, colleges, hospitals, and workers' housing. All of this proves that the cultural and economic well-being of the people is steadily rising. Every honest citizen we have seen exudes an expression of happiness and loveliness, which is unforgettable."
    Sonia Lopata concluded: "Your country is a source of profound wisdom. I thank the All-China Democratic Women's Federation once again for enabling me to draw knowledge from this source of wisdom. I return to my country with the intention of peace and the spirit of creation. I wish you success in your future construction and a happy future for your people, which is a strong guarantee of world peace."
      Australian Women Representatives
    According to Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po": Mrs. Jessie Street, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and an Australian writer, and Miss Lucy Woodcock, an Australian peace representative, who were invited to visit China, expressed their impressions of their visit to China to Hong Kong journalists on October 29 when they passed through Hong Kong on their way back home.
    Mrs. Street said: "The Chinese people are managing their own affairs themselves for the first time in more than a hundred years. This is a big deal, especially when we think of this country having 600 million people, accounting for a quarter of the world's population." She said: "Everyone who hopes for world peace and respects justice must support China in obtaining its due representation in the United Nations."
    Mrs. Street said: "The Chinese people are happy and enthusiastic in their work. They are working closely with the government to improve their living standards." She also said: "I am deeply moved by the women of the new China. They now stand on a completely equal footing with men. In Western countries, women are still discriminated against."
    Miss Woodcock said: In Chinese factories and institutions, women can be seen holding leadership positions, and the status of Chinese women is guaranteed by the state. She also said: "I have visited many schools in Chinese cities and rural areas. From the perspective of my 30 years of experience as a primary school principal, their teaching is very complete."

    访问我国的外国朋友们发表观感
    日本化学石油工会代表团
    应中华全国总工会邀请来我国访问、参观的日本化学石油工会代表团团长浅野正三等五人在离开北京去苏联前夕，曾联名写信向中华全国总工会告别。信中说：“十几天中，我们在北京、上海、沈阳各地参观了各工业及工人的福利情况，我们对中国所取得的伟大的成就表示敬意，同时对中国解放后在很短的时间里取得这样大的成就表示惊奇，我们确信由于新民主主义革命的胜利才取得这样的成就。
    由于美帝国主义者违反日本人民的意志，阻挠中日两国恢复邦交，目前中日邦交尚未恢复正常状态。我们痛切感到这种不自然的状态阻碍着通往和平的道路。为了建立世界和平，必须迅速改变这种现状。我们再一次认识到改变这种现状是我们的义务。
    现在当我们离开中国的时候，我们心中所感受到的是在这短短时间内所建立的友谊以及中国同志们的宽大为怀和充满仁慈的友情。”
    英国各界访华代表团团员
    据香港“大公报”、“文汇报”报道：应中国人民对外文化协会邀请来中国访问的英国各界访华代表团的三位团员——英国议会工党议员巴·卡斯尔夫人、工党议员查·罗伊尔和伦敦大学学院讲师德·詹姆斯博士，五日在香港接见各报记者，发表访问中国的观感。
    卡斯尔夫人首先谈到中国对各国的友好愿望，她说：“我们在中国获得的一个印象是，新中国的政权是非常稳固的，它愿意同各国建立友好关系。”她说：“我们都被中国政府那种明显的增进同我国关系的愿望感动了。我们获得一种印象，就是中国有真正友好的愿望来消除中英关系上的障碍，更进一步促进中英两国之间的关系。”
    卡斯尔夫人还谈到中国人民的建设成就。她说：“中国进行建设的规模是很庞大的。他们在铁路、房屋、水库、学校、医院等各方面的建设中所获得的进展，给予我们很深的印象。”
    罗伊尔议员和詹姆斯博士也向记者讲述了中国城市建设、医疗设备、清洁卫生等方面的进步情况。罗伊尔说：“中国人民正在进行着他们在历史上没有做过的许多事情。”
    法国妇女代表团
    应中华全国民主妇女联合会邀请来我国访问的法国妇女代表团五人由团长、法国保卫儿童全国运动玛丽尔·布伦赫斯—德拉马尔夫人率领在十月二十八日离开北京回国。
    法国妇女代表团行前致函中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，信里首先说：“我们的中国朋友们对我们为了要了解情况而不断提出的无数问题都不嫌其烦地作了解答，并为我们组织了各种参观和访问。这使我们感觉到我们彼此之间如此亲切，并使得我们能亲眼看到各方面的成就。”
    信里接着说：“我们参观了城市、农村、工厂、学校和诊疗所。农村中生活的改善，新工人住宅区的兴建，保健工作，大规模的扫除文盲的斗争等，使我们体会到所完成的改革的巨大，和这些改革所含有的为人民谋幸福的深刻意义。在这个可爱的如此美丽的国家里，我们深深感觉到人们不断关怀着给予每个人以发展他最好的才能、技术和体力的机会，所有的人都能获得最现代化的知识，而同时却设法尊重并发扬过去的遗产。
    “中国儿童光采焕发的面容和他们对我们亲切的招呼将永远留在我们的记忆中，永远留在我们的心中。他们的幸福和前途的确是全中国所不断关心的事，全中国在尽力照顾他们。
   “我们知道中国妇女在这些努力，这些建设中所起的作用。我们同各种工作岗位上的中国妇女接触，她们反映出中国妇女的显著改变，她们意识到她们的责任，正在热情地完成着她们的任务。”
    信里最后说：“在我们的旅程中，我们随时都听到中国人民对法国人民所表示的友情，和他们的深切的和平愿望，这种愿望鼓舞着新中国以无限奋勇的热情在生活的道路上前进。
    “我们这次和中国妇女的会晤更加深了相互间的友谊。因此我们希望在不久的将来，我们也能够在法国欢迎中国妇女的代表，并希望我们间的来往能成为中华人民共和国和法国建立友好关系的前奏。这样，将有助于世界各国和平共处的条件的加强。这是我们最深切的愿望，因为和平是我们共同的福利。”
      以色列妇女代表
    应中华全国民主妇女联合会邀请前来我国参观的以色列妇女代表约纳·戈兰和索尼亚·洛帕塔二人，在四日晨乘飞机离开北京回国。她们在北京时曾参加了我国国庆典礼，并先后在北京、沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、南京、上海和杭州等地参观、访问。在离京前，她们分别写信给中华全国民主妇女联合会，发表访华观感。约纳·戈兰写道：“有机会访问中国，访问它的城市、乡村、工厂、矿山、文化机关、学校、托儿所、休养地、博物馆、历史古迹和名胜，特别是会见它的人民，为每一个人展开了了解在人类生活和人类历史发展中起作用的力量的新的远景。对于每一个怀抱崇高而单纯的理想、和平和各国人民之间的友谊、全人类和他们的孩子的幸福和安全的理想的人说来，这是一个高级的学校。
    我们理解到，新中国的主要目的，是国家工业化和农业集体化。
    我们看见并了解了中国人民在共产党的领导下如何解放了你们伟大人民的巨大的生产和创造的力量，你们伟大的人民几世纪以来曾遭受可恶的帝国主义和封建制度的束缚和奴役。
    我们有机会会见了你们的第一个女司机田桂英，我们知道她是第一个而不是最后一个。她象征着新中国为全体中国妇女开辟了的通往各生产部门、一切创造形式的广阔开敞着的道路。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会教育和教导了妇女们利用这些机会为她们祖国的美好和为全人类的幸福施展她们的能力。”
    约纳·戈兰最后写道：“回到国内，我将尽量告知中国解放的伟大景象，尽量告知毛泽东主席和共产党所领导的中国人民的新生活的转变和建设的情况。
    中国人民正作着和平的工作，因此世界的和平是能够维护的。”
    索尼亚·洛帕塔写道：“我很荣幸能够到你们迷人的国家来作客。现在，六个星期愉快的观光时光过完了。我衷心地感谢你们热诚的款待。在我们所访问过和游历过的一切地方，我们都明显地看到母亲和儿童所受到的关怀。到处都可以看到可爱的健康的儿童。我们知道，儿童、成年人和老年人全都在学习。可以确实地说，所有的人都在学习，整个民族都在学习。不过五年以前，中国妇女还是没有权利，处于悲惨的境况，现在这是再也看不到的事了。妇女当了政府的部长、市镇领导工作人员、合作社负责人、中等和高等学校校长、医院院长、火车司机、拖拉机手、电气技工等等。无论在那里，妇女都和男子享有平等的权利。这正是全世界妇女的愿望。我们在北京和其他各地看到了新盖的大楼房：中学、高等学校、医院、工人住宅。这一切都证明人民的文化和经济福利都在稳步地上升。我们所看到的每一个正直的公民都流露出一种幸福和可爱的表情，令我们很难忘怀。”
    索尼亚·洛帕塔最后写道：“你们的国家是深广的智慧的泉源。我再一次感谢中国民主妇联，感谢它使我得以在这智慧的泉源中汲取知识。我带着和平的意愿和创造的精神回国去。我谨祝你们今后的建设胜利，祝你们人民获得幸福的前途，这也就是世界和平的有力保证。”
      澳大利亚妇女代表
    据香港“大公报”和“文汇报”报道：应邀访问中国的世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、澳大利亚作家杰西·斯崔特夫人和澳大利亚和平代表刘西·伍德库克小姐，十月二十九日途经香港回国时对香港新闻记者发表了这次访问中国的观感。
    斯崔特夫人说：“中国人民自己起来管理自己的事情，这还是百年多来的第一次。这是一件大事，特别是我们想到这个国家具有六亿人口，占了全世界人口四分之一。”她说：“每一个希望世界和平和尊重公理的人，都必须支持中国在联合国中获得应有的代表地位。”
    斯崔特夫人说：“中国人民是愉快的，工作是热情的，他们为提高生活水平而同政府进行紧密合作。”她并说：“新中国妇女令我深为感动。她们现在已经同男子站在完全平等的地位。在西方国家，那里的妇女仍受到歧视。”
    伍德库克小姐说：在中国工厂、机关里，都可以看到担负领导工作的妇女，中国妇女的地位受到了国家的保障。她又说：“我参观了中国许多城市和农村的学校，以我当了三十年小学校长经验的眼光来看，他们的教学是很完善的。”（据新华社讯）
