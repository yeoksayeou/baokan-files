    Words to the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Alar
    ——Second poem of the "First Entry into Qaidam" series
    Li Ji
    Young petroleum geological exploration team members,
    Please dedicate a passionate short song to it;
    Respectable, gray-haired geologists,
    Please offer your most sincere praise to it;
    Good brothers of the Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Kazakh ethnicities,
    When you pass by here pulling camels transporting equipment,
    Please also take off your weathered felt hats,
    And pay sincere respects to these graves!
    Because there is a group of our dearest relatives,
    They are resting here for the sake of us all.
    What they did is more than we can add up,
    They watered our lives today and tomorrow with fresh blood.
    Before the Party that nurtured them,
    They would not feel ashamed at all;
    They did everything a soldier could do,
    They gloriously spent their lives.
    Bitter water soaking the tender seedlings of Coptis chinensis,
    This is a portrayal of their childhood lives.
    When the reactionary flames spread across the land,
    They were the first to take up guns and knives following the red flag.
    It was they who brought the warm sun of Mao Zedong,
    To every city and village shrouded in darkness.
    It was they who, without even drying the blood from their wounds,
    Marched into the Qaidam Basin, which was occupied by bandits.
    At that time, you and I were celebrating the victory,
    But they were rushing on the Kunlun Mountains where snow flew in June.
    At that time, we could already eat a full meal after labor,
    But they were still swallowing frozen, stone-like dry rations.
    It was they who, in the uninhabited Gobi Desert,
    Built fortresses and barracks.
    It was they who, in the place where even weeds did not grow,
    Reclaimed lush vegetable farms.
    Most unforgettable was the battle on the Kunlun Mountains,
    Their entire company got lost in the mountains.
    People had no dry food, horses had no fodder,
    People were even dreaming of touching the water bottle that had been dry for three days.
    Horses, hungry, turned around to bite their own tails,
    People, holding stones in their mouths, were dizzy.
    When a fraternal unit came to rescue them,
    Both people and horses had fainted and fallen to the ground.
    They sacrificed in such battles,
    They were such heroes.
    Shouldn't we give them the highest honor?
    Aren't their names worthy of our eternal respect?
    [Note] Alar, place name, located on the shore of Gas Lake in the northwest of the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai.

    写给阿拉尔革命烈士墓的话
    ——“初进柴达木”组诗之二
    李季
    年轻的石油地质探勘队员呵，
    请你为它献上一只热情的短歌；
    可敬爱的两鬓苍苍的地质师呵，
    请你把最虔诚的颂词献给它；
    回、蒙、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克族的好兄弟，
    当你拉着运送器材的骆驼经过这里，
    也请你脱下你那饱经风霜的毡帽，
    虔诚地向这些坟墓行个礼！
    因为有一群我和你最亲爱的亲人，
    他们为了我们大家而长眠在这里。
    他们所做的，比咱们加起来的还要多，
    他们用鲜血灌溉了我们今天和明天的生活。
    在抚育了他们的党的面前，
    他们一点也不会感到脸红；
    他们做到了一个战士所能做的一切，
    他们光荣地度过了自己的一生。
    苦水里浸泡着一棵棵黄连的嫩苗，
    这就是他们幼年生活的写照。
    当那反动的毒焰弥漫大地的时候，
    是他们最先跟着红旗拿起了枪刀。
    是他们把温暖的毛泽东的太阳，
    送到每一个被夜幕笼罩着的城市、乡村。
    是他们还没有擦干伤口上的血滴，
    就向匪徒盘踞的柴达木盆地进军。
    那时候，我和你都在为胜利狂欢，
    而他们却正在六月飞雪的昆仑山上飞奔。
    那时候，我们在劳动后已经可以吃上一顿饱饭，
    而他们却还在把冰冻的石头般的干粮吞咽。
    是他们在渺无人烟的戈壁滩上，
    修造起了一座座城堡、营房。
    是他们在那连野草都不生长的地方，
    开垦了一片片茂盛的菜蔬农场。
    最难忘在昆仑山上的那次战斗，
    他们整整一连人马在山上迷了路。
    人没有干粮，马没有草料，
    人们连做梦都在摸着那早已干了三天的水壶。
    马呀，饿得回过头来咬自己的尾巴，
    人呀，把石头噙在嘴里，两眼昏花。
    当一支兄弟部队赶来救援他们的时候，
    人和马都已经昏迷地倒在地下。
    他们就是在这样的战斗中牺牲，
    他们就是像这样的英雄。
    难道我们不应当把最高的荣誉给予他们？
    他们的名字，难道不值得我们永远尊敬？
    〔注〕阿拉尔，地名，在青海柴达木盆地西北部的尕斯湖边。
