He pointed out that the appeal from the 8th session of the Supreme People's Assembly had received warm support and approval from all the Korean people, but the Syngman Rhee clique had unreasonably rejected the appeal. He emphasized that the Korean issue must be resolved by the Koreans themselves through consultation. He called on all political parties, social organizations, patriotic figures, and all the people of Korea in South Korea to further struggle for the realization of the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland.
    Subsequently, the participants in the meeting enthusiastically discussed the report on measures to implement the appeal from the 8th session of the Supreme People's Assembly. Kim Won-bong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean People's Republican Party, called on all political parties and social organizations in South Korea to rise up without hesitation and fight to realize the task of peaceful reunification of the Fatherland put forward by the 8th session of the Supreme People's Assembly. He suggested that the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea write letters to members of various political parties and social organizations in South Korea, as well as non-partisan political figures and social figures.
    Ra Seung-kyu, Chairman of the People's Alliance, requested that representatives from North and South Korea immediately conduct negotiations in order to promote the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland. In discussing the announcement by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea guaranteeing the personal safety and freedom of activity of South Korean individuals who come to the North to discuss the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland and to establish contact between North and South Korea, he pointed out that this is another effort by the Republic's government to strive for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland. He demanded that the South Korean authorities also take similar measures to enable contact and exchanges between North and South Korea.
    Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, Jung Sung-yeon, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, and Ding Qixing, Vice Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, also spoke at the meeting.

    讨论关于和平统一朝鲜的措施
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会十一月十九日举行了第三十六次会议，讨论了实施朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议关于和平统一祖国的号召书的措施问题。

    出席会议的还有最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉。
    金昌俊首先在会上作了关于实施最高人民会议第八届会议的号召书的措施的报告。他指出，最高人民会议第八届会议的号召书受到了全朝鲜人民热烈的支持和赞同，但是，李承晚集团却毫无道理地拒绝了这个号召书。他着重指出，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人自己通过协商来取得解决。他号召南朝鲜各政党、社会团体、爱国人士和全朝鲜人民进一步为实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。
    接着，会议的参加者热烈地讨论了实施最高人民会议第八届会议号召书的措施的报告。朝鲜人民共和党中央委员会委员长金元凤号召南朝鲜各政党、社会团体毫不犹疑地起来，为实现最高人民会议第八届会议所提出的和平统一祖国的任务而斗争。他建议以朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的名义写信给南朝鲜各政党、社会团体的成员，以及无党派政界人士和社会人士。
    民众同盟委员长罗承奎要求南北朝鲜的代表立即进行谈判，以便促进祖国的和平统一。他在谈到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所宣布的保证那些到北部来讨论和平统一祖国和在南北朝鲜之间建立接触的南朝鲜人士的人身安全和活动自由时指出，这是共和国政府争取祖国和平统一的又一努力。他要求南朝鲜当局也采取同样的措施，使南北朝鲜进行接触和交往。
    朝鲜天道教青友党中央委员会委员长金达铉、北朝鲜民主党中央委员会副委员长郑圣彦、朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长丁七星等都在会上讲了话。
    最后，会议通过了关于实施最高人民会议第八届会议的号召书的措施的决定。会议还通过了朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会致南朝鲜各政党、社会团体的成员以及无党派的政界人士和社会人士的信件。
