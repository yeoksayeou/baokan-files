    Resolutely Eliminate the Activities of Gangsters and Bandits
    In the past five years, after a series of social reform movements and political movements in our country, and after large-scale education and transformation work, many of the gangsters and bandits left over from the old China have turned over a new leaf and engaged in productive labor and other legitimate occupations; however, there are still some gangsters and bandits who are stubbornly clinging to their errors, refusing education and transformation, and continuing to do evil in society. It is absolutely necessary for the people to demand the resolute elimination of the activities of gangsters and bandits.
    Recently, according to the demands of the masses and relying on the help of the masses, the public security organs of Jiangsu Province completely cracked down on the two major bandit groups, the "Shuihuo Gang" and the "Qiongjiang Xing," which had been disrupting public order in urban and rural areas and committing numerous crimes for decades in the Taihu Lake, Yangtze River, and Longhai Railway areas, and punished them according to law. This is gratifying to the people.
    However, the activities of gangsters and bandits left over from the old China are by no means limited to these; in many other places, we can also find their criminal activities. First of all, there is a group of old gangsters and habitual thieves who are doing evil everywhere. For example, fighting in public places, causing trouble while drunk, destroying public property; stealing, swindling, and robbing state and people's property; molesting, insulting, and raping women; and even killing people to "silence" them, etc. Some of them act alone, and some have formed groups of three to five or even dozens of people to carry out organized activities. Some not only do evil themselves, but also use various despicable means to lure some young people with weak wills onto the path of crime. The "Ai Daocheng Father and Son Stealing Group" in Echeng County, Hubei Province, once recruited more than 70 disciples, most of whom were teenagers and young people. In addition to this group of old gangsters and habitual thieves who refuse to be reformed, there are also some landlord class elements who are unwilling to engage in labor after the land reform, counter-revolutionary elements who escaped the crackdown during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and some former puppet military officers, puppet policemen, puppet constables, and leaders of secret societies who refuse to be reformed. These people have also joined the criminal groups of these gangsters and bandits. These gangster elements harbor insane hatred and hostility towards our country and people, and they do not hesitate to use all despicable and dirty means to disrupt our social order and public security, and to sabotage our various construction undertakings. In addition, there are also a small number of illegal capitalists who are also taking this path. They use money, women, pornographic paintings and calligraphy, and the life of eating, drinking, and playing in obscene entertainment venues to lure employees with weak wills onto the path of gangsters and bandits, or directly buy gangsters and bandits to disrupt social order, steal and destroy state property.
    In order to carry out socialist construction, we need good social order; however, the gangsters and bandits left over from the old China seriously hinder us from establishing good order. For socialist construction, we need all the people to work hard and increase social wealth and state property; but gangsters and bandits are taking advantage of certain weaknesses in some people, pulling them away from labor, and destroying state property and social wealth; we demand that the younger generation develop into people with high civic morality and construction capabilities; but gangsters and bandits are instigating young people to take the wrong path, wanting them to degenerate and become corrupted. All of these things show that the criminal activities of gangsters and bandits directly endanger our great socialist cause.
    The criminal activities of gangsters and bandits also directly help the activities of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who are attempting to restore their rule. They help this group of vile and shameless gangsters in various ways, hoping to use them to disrupt the revolutionary order, and to corrupt some backward elements and those with weak wills in terms of their life consciousness, so that these people can ruin their personality and morality, and embark on the path of selling themselves for bribes and political counter-revolution. And some of these gangster elements, who have lost all sense of shame, are also happy to accept the command and subsidies of those engaged in restoration activities, and completely degenerate into counter-revolutionary elements who directly participate in counter-revolutionary activities by betraying their motherland.
    Obviously, in the period of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation, the struggle between gangster and bandit activities and anti-gangster and anti-bandit activities is not, as some comrades say, an "internal problem of the people," but a life-and-death struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The victory or defeat of this struggle is directly related to the success or failure of the socialist cause. In his essay "How to Organize Competition," Lenin called for "a decisive battle against swindlers, idlers, and hooligans," and called hooligans and swindlers and the overthrown exploiters "the two main parasites nurtured by capitalism," "the two main enemies of socialism," "enemies of the people," and "enemies of the workers," which is the reason for this. Lenin instructed: "These enemies should be specially monitored by the entire people, and when they slightly violate the rules and laws of socialist society, they should be relentlessly punished. Any weakness, any hesitation, any pity in this regard is a great crime against socialism."
    However, many of our state organs and staff members, when dealing with gangster criminals, believe that they have no obvious political motives or political background, or think that their "class background" is not bad and that they have no crimes in their history, so they want to find some reasons to reduce or even exempt them from the punishment they deserve.
    Regarding incidents of insulting and raping women, they often say that they are "minor lifestyle issues" and "personal character issues." Even for those who have committed heinous crimes of raping and abusing underage girls, they are not arrested or detained, or are only "given criticism and education"; even if they are sentenced, it is a light sentence. Those who hold this view do not see that this is a reflection of class struggle and the struggle between the enemy and ourselves, and do not see that this is a reflection of the struggle between two worlds and two systems, but think that it is simply a matter of personal character and life consciousness, and therefore are weak and hesitant in punishment. The result of this will make the people doubt the effectiveness of our laws and our determination to eliminate evil, and doubt whether we are sincerely protecting the people, and therefore it will affect the people's enthusiasm and confidence in the cause of construction. If we do not destroy the remnants of the reactionary system with an iron fist, they will corrode the healthy body like a malignant tumor.
    What we should pay special attention to is that many of these gangsters and bandits have been trained in labor reform once or twice. The people's government taught them production skills and pointed out the path of self-renewal through labor, but they still insist on that decadent lifestyle of not working for food. Therefore, we must use the law to force them into labor production, rather than finding reasons to forgive them. What is especially serious is that the enemy is intensifying the use of gangsters and bandits to sabotage our construction undertakings. Anyone who thinks that gangsters and bandits will disappear on their own in the future and therefore does not take active measures will definitely make mistakes and cause undue harm to the country and the people.
    Therefore, there can only be one conclusion, and that is to relentlessly punish those gangsters and bandits who continue to commit crimes, as Lenin said. Those who should be killed must be killed resolutely, those who should be sentenced to heavy sentences must be sentenced to heavy sentences resolutely, those who should be controlled must be controlled resolutely, and those who should be forced to work must be forced to work resolutely, without the slightest weakness, hesitation, or pity. Only in this way can we effectively combat and even eliminate gangsters and bandits. Of course, for those young people and teenagers who accidentally commit crimes, whose circumstances are not serious, and who are easily corrected through criticism and education because they are instigated by others, workers such as shop assistants and apprentices, or ordinary gangster elements who have only contracted some gangster habits and have no major bad deeds, there should be a distinction in the treatment of them and those habitual offenders, and we should strengthen the work of transforming and educating them.
    Obscene entertainment venues and yellow, pornographic paintings and calligraphy must be resolutely banned.
    At the same time, attention must also be paid to the education of the broad masses of the people. That is, to universally expose the class essence of gangster and bandit activities to the masses of the people, to educate the people to recognize the situation of the struggle between the enemy and ourselves, to recognize the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary classes, so that everyone can become clear-headed and consciously assist the people's government in cracking down on the activities of gangsters and bandits.
    The Party and Youth League organizations, state organs and factories, and schools should automatically stand up and undertake this task. Parents of young people and teenagers should also cooperate with state organs and schools to educate their children so that they can wage a resolute struggle against gangsters and bandits.

### 坚决肃清流氓、盗匪的活动

    坚决 肃清流氓、盗匪的活动
    我国五年来经过一连串的社会改革运动和政治运动，经过大规模的教育和改造工作，已经使旧中国遗留下来的流氓、盗匪有很多人改邪归正，从事生产劳动和其他正当职业；但是也还有一部分流氓、盗匪执迷不悟，拒绝教育和改造，继续在社会上为非作恶。人民群众要求坚决肃清流氓、盗匪的活动，这是完全必要的。
    最近江苏省公安机关根据群众的要求和依靠群众的帮助，将几十年来在太湖、长江和陇海铁路沿线，扰乱城乡治安，犯罪累累的“水火帮”、“穷江行”两大盗匪集团，全部破获，依法惩处，这是大快人心的。
    但是旧中国遗留下来的流氓、盗匪的活动决不只这些；在其他许多地方，我们同样可以发现他们的罪恶活动。首先是有一批老流氓和惯盗到处为非作歹。比如在公共场所打架斗殴，酗酒滋事，毁坏公物；偷窃、诈骗、抢劫国家和人民的财产；调戏、侮辱和强奸妇女；甚至为“灭口”而杀人，等等。他们有的是单独活动，有的还结成三、五人至数十人的集团，进行有组织的活动。有的不仅自己作恶，而且用各种卑鄙手段诱骗一些意志薄弱的青年少年人走上犯罪的道路。湖北省鄂城县有一个“艾道成父子盗窃集团”曾经招收门徒七十多人，其中大部分是十几岁的青年和少年人。在这批拒绝改造的老流氓和惯盗之外，还有在土地改革之后不愿意从事劳动的一部分地主阶级分子，经过镇压反革命运动而没有受到打击的漏网反革命分子以及一些拒绝改造的伪军官、伪警察、伪宪兵和会道门头子等人，也加入了这些流氓、盗匪的犯罪集团。这些流氓分子对我们的国家和人民怀抱着疯狂的仇恨和敌意，不惜用一切卑鄙龌龊的手段来破坏我们的社会秩序和治安，破坏我们的各种建设事业。另外还有少数不法资本家，也在走着这条道路。他们用金钱、女人、淫乱书画和下流娱乐场所的吃喝玩乐生活来勾引意志薄弱的职工走上流氓、盗匪的道路，或者直接收买流氓、盗匪来扰乱社会治安，偷窃和破坏国家财产。
    为了进行社会主义建设，我们需要良好的社会秩序；但是旧中国遗留的流氓、盗匪却严重地妨害着我们建立良好的秩序。为了社会主义建设，我们需要所有的人民奋勇劳动，增加社会财富和国家财产；但流氓、盗匪却在利用一部分人的某些弱点，拉着他们脱离劳动，破坏国家财产和社会财富；我们要求青年一代发展成为具有高尚公民道德和建设能力的人；但流氓、盗匪却在教唆青年人走邪路，要他们堕落腐化。所有这些，都说明流氓、盗匪们的犯罪活动直接危害着我们伟大的社会主义事业。
    流氓、盗匪的犯罪活动，还直接帮助着企图复辟的美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的活动。他们从各方面帮助这批下流无耻的流氓，希望经过他们来破坏革命的秩序，并且从生活意识上腐蚀一部分落伍分子和意志薄弱者，使这些人败坏自己的人格和道德，走上卖身受贿和政治上反革命的道路。而这批丧尽了廉耻心的流氓分子中的若干人，也乐于接受复辟活动者的指挥和津贴，完全堕落成背叛祖国的直接参加反革命活动的反革命分子。
    很明显，在社会主义革命即社会主义改造的时期，流氓、盗匪活动同反流氓、盗匪活动的斗争，并不是像某些同志所说的是“人民内部问题”，而是革命同反革命决死斗争的问题。这一斗争的胜负，直接关系着社会主义事业的成败。列宁在“怎样组织竞赛”的论文中号召“要对骗子、懒汉、流氓决战”，把流氓骗子和被推翻了的剥削者称为“资本主义养育成的两种主要的寄生虫”，“社会主义的两种主要敌人”，“人民公敌”，“劳动者的公敌”，就是这个道理。列宁指示说：“对于这些敌人，应当由全体人民加以特别监视，当他们稍一违犯社会主义社会的规则和法令时，便应无情地加以惩治。在这方面表示任何软弱，任何动摇，任何悯惜，都是对社会主义的莫大罪行。”
    可是，我们有不少的国家机关和工作人员在处理流氓犯罪分子的时候，认为他们没有什么明显的政治目的和政治背景，或者以为他们“成分”不坏，历史上没什么罪恶，就想找出一点什么理由来减轻甚至免除他们应受的惩罚。
    对于侮辱和强奸妇女的事件，他们往往说是
  “生活小节”，“个人品质问题”，甚至对于奸污和摧残了未成年幼女的罪大恶极者，也不捕不押，或仅“给予批评教育”；即使判刑，也是从轻。持这种见解的人，看不见这是阶级斗争和敌我斗争的反映，看不见这是两个世界、两种制度的斗争的反映，而认为是单纯的个人品质问题和生活意识问题，因而在惩罚上软弱动摇。这个结果就会使人民因而怀疑我们法律的效力和除恶的决心，怀疑我们是否真心诚意保护人民，因此也就会影响到人民对建设的事业的热情和信心。如果我们不用钢铁的手把反动制度的余孽摧毁，他们就会像毒瘤一样腐蚀到健康的身体。
    特别值得我们注意的是，现在这些流氓、盗匪中有很多人曾经一次两次的受过劳动改造的训练，人民政府教给他们以生产技能，指给他们以劳动自新的道路，但是他们仍然坚持那种不劳而食的腐朽生活方式。所以我们必须用法律把他们逼到劳动生产中来，而不是找出理由来原谅他们。尤其严重的问题是敌人正在加紧利用流氓、盗匪来破坏我们的建设事业。谁如果以为流氓、盗匪将来会自行消灭，因而不采取积极措施，他就一定要犯错误，使国家和人民遭受不应有的损害。
    因此，结论只能有一个，那就是要像列宁所说的那样，无情地惩治那些继续犯罪的流氓、盗匪，该杀的坚决杀，该判重刑的坚决判重刑，该管制的坚决管制，该强迫劳动的坚决强迫他们劳动，不要有丝毫的软弱、动摇和悯惜。只有这样，才能有效地打击以至消灭流氓、盗匪。当然，对于那些偶然犯罪，情节并不严重、而且是由于受人教唆、容易经过批评教育而改邪归正的青年人和少年人，劳动者如店员、学徒等，或者只是沾染了一些流氓习气，而没有重大劣迹的一般流氓分子，应该在处理上和那些惯犯们有所分别，应该加强对他们的改造、教育工作。
    对于下流的娱乐场所，黄色的淫乱书画，必须坚决加以取缔。
    同时也必须注意到对于广大人民的教育。这就是要求向人民群众普遍揭发流氓、盗匪活动的阶级实质，教育人民认识敌我斗争形势，认识反革命分子和反动阶级的阴谋，使大家头脑清醒起来，自觉地协助人民政府取缔流氓、盗匪的活动。
    党和青年团的组织，国家机关和工厂，学校，都应该自动起来担负这一任务。青年少年的家长们，也应该配合国家机关和学校，教育自己的子弟，使他们和流氓、盗匪作坚决的斗争。
