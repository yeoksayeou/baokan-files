	Guangdong Province's final silkworm cocoon harvest of the year (seven or eight harvests are done annually) has concluded. According to preliminary statistics, the total cocoon production reached approximately over 160,000 dan, a slight increase compared to last year.

	This spring, some farmers, misunderstanding the state's price policies and seeing greater benefits in growing sugarcane compared to mulberry, blindly dug up mulberry trees to plant sugarcane, leading to a 14% decrease in mulberry field area compared to last year. However, after re-educating the farmers on the General Line, they realized the importance of mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing in supporting national industrialization. Simultaneously, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement improved the conditions for silkworm rearing. The state also addressed the production difficulties of some mulberry-cultivating and silkworm-rearing farmers by pre-purchasing cocoons and providing fertilizer loans, which increased their enthusiasm for mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing. The unit yield generally increased compared to last year. The unit area yield of mulberry fields is estimated to have increased by more than 10% compared to last year. On average, each spring white cocoon silkworm egg card produced about 10% more cocoons than the same period last year. In the autumn, 18,000 white cocoon silkworm egg cards produced an average of over 30 jin of cocoons each, about 60% higher than last autumn. The harvest rate of Shaqing cocoon silkworm eggs was less than 50% last year but reached about 70% this year.

	Due to the increase in unit area yield of mulberry fields and the bumper harvest of silkworm cocoons, coupled with the elimination of the free market for silkworm cocoons and raw silk this year, the supply of raw materials for Guangdong's silk industry has been guaranteed.

    广东省今年蚕茧总产量达十六万多担
    广东省今年蚕茧生产的最后一造（每年要生产七、八造）已经结束。据初步统计，蚕茧总产量约达十六万多担，比去年稍有增产。
    今年春，部分农民由于不了解国家价格政策，看到种植甘蔗比种桑有利，就盲目地挖桑改种甘蔗，使今年桑地面积比去年减少了百分之十四。但经过向农民进行总路线的再教育，使他们认识到种桑养蚕对支援国家工业化的重要意义；同时由于互助合作运动的发展，改善了养蚕的条件；国家又通过蚕茧的预购和贷肥，解决了部分养蚕种桑农民生产的困难，提高了农民种桑养蚕积极性，单位产量一般都比去年增加。桑地单位面积产量估计比去年增产一成以上。春季白茧蚕种平均每张产茧比去年同期增产百分之十左右；秋季一万八千张白茧蚕种，平均每张产茧三十斤以上，比去年秋季提高百分之六十左右。沙青茧蚕种去年收获率不到百分之五十，今年则达到百分之七十左右。
    由于桑地单位面积产量的提高和蚕茧的丰收，同时今年取消了蚕茧和土丝的自由市场，就保证了广东省蚕丝工业原料的供应。（本报广东记者站）
