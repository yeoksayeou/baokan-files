People in cultural and academic circles in the capital are paying great attention to the ideological criticism of bourgeois viewpoints in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber."

The joint (expanded) meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association has been held four times consecutively on October 31, November 7, and November 11. At the meeting, heated criticism and discussion were launched on Yu Pingbo's erroneous views on the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and the errors of "Wenyi Bao" in the criticism of "Dream of the Red Chamber" research. The discussion is still ongoing.

In addition to the two symposiums held by the Chinese Department, teachers at Peking University are also planning to hold discussions in the departments of philosophy, history, and Western languages to criticize Yu Pingbo's erroneous views on "Dream of the Red Chamber."

Chinese Department teachers continued their symposium at 3:00 p.m. on the 10th. Those who spoke at the meeting on the 10th included Yang Hui, Zhou Zumo, Wang Li, Wu Zuxiang, Wang Yao, Ji Zhenhuai, Wu Tongbao, Qian Xuexi, Ren Jiyu, Shi Jun, and Tian Changyu. At the symposium, everyone further exposed Yu Pingbo's erroneous views in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and criticized the influence and poisoning of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist viewpoints in the field of classical literature research. Some professors pointed out in their speeches that Yu Pingbo's erroneous views had not attracted attention at Peking University for a long time, which was inseparable from the liberal attitude among teachers towards erroneous ideas. Some people had opinions on Yu Pingbo's research work on weekdays, but never raised them, fearing to tear "sentiment" and not distinguishing right from wrong. From the criticism of Yu Pingbo's erroneous viewpoints, everyone realized that it is very urgent and necessary to study Marxism-Leninism seriously. Many professors also focused on examining the errors of bourgeois idealist viewpoints they had committed in their academic research work, and urgently requested to eliminate the influence of this harm to the revolutionary cause and academic development through this discussion.

After the criticism of "Dream of the Red Chamber" research successively revealed Hu Shi's reactionary philosophy and literary thought, the heads of the teaching and research sections and the head of the philosophy department of Peking University jointly conducted research. Everyone believed that Hu Shi's reactionary subjective idealist "experimentalism" thought not only needs to be eliminated in the literary world, but also should be criticized in philosophy, history, education, archeology, linguistics, and other aspects. Especially at Peking University, criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts is of practical significance. Therefore, it was decided to organize teachers from various majors in the Department of Philosophy to carry out the work of criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary philosophical thoughts, and initially planned to focus on the following three topics: criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary bourgeois ideological methods; criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary social and political thoughts; and criticizing Hu Shi's bourgeois thoughts in the research work of the history of philosophy. And prepare to organize discussions or publish publicly when the research has results.

The Institute of Literature Research of Peking University also recently convened a meeting of all researchers to study and launch a criticism of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist literary thought, and to further improve the research work of the institute. He Qifang, deputy director of the Institute of Literature Research, explained at the meeting the great significance of the criticism of Yu Pingbo's erroneous stance, viewpoints, and methods in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," which was initiated by Li Xifan and Lan Ling and called on everyone to pay attention to by the People's Daily. He said: Yu Pingbo is a researcher at the Institute of Literature Research. Although his articles on "Dream of the Red Chamber" published in recent years are personal amateur activities, the leadership of the institute did not pay attention to the publication of these articles and their impact, and did not discover the problem in time and launch criticism within the institute. This is a serious shortcoming in the work of the institute. He said that we should learn from the shortcomings and errors exposed in this work and gain experience and lessons. He suggested that everyone seriously read the important materials related to this ideological struggle, launch discussions, write articles to participate in the debate, and put forward opinions on improving the work of the research institute. Yu Guanying, Cai Yi, Fan Ning, Luo Dagang, Bian Zhilin, Li Yang, Cao Daoheng and others also spoke at the meeting. Everyone unanimously believed that whether studying Chinese or foreign literature, we must oppose bourgeois idealism and subjectivism, and oppose the viewpoints of "art for art's sake" and that art has nothing to do with politics. In view of the shortcomings of the institute's work, we should pay attention to the current situation of research work at any time and strengthen criticism and self-criticism. The meeting also decided that all researchers of the institute should read and discuss the articles published in the People's Daily and other newspapers and periodicals related to this debate.

The Literary Lecture Institute of the Chinese Writers Association has also taken the criticism of erroneous viewpoints in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber" as the central topic of study since November 1. They plan to spend three weeks studying this. At present, all students and teaching staff are reading the original "Dream of the Red Chamber" and articles criticizing Yu Pingbo's erroneous viewpoints. From next week, they will enter group chats and classroom discussions. They demand that through this study, they will further recognize Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist erroneous viewpoints and methods in the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," so as to establish correct viewpoints and methods for studying classical literary works; at the same time, through criticism and self-criticism, they will examine and eliminate the bourgeois ideology and style they have been infected with, and examine their incorrect attitude towards classical literary heritage.

    重视对“红楼梦”研究中错误观点的批判
    【本报讯】对“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点的思想批判，已引起首都文化界、学术界的极大重视。
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团召开的联席（扩大）会议，已经在十月三十一日、十一月七日、十一月十一日连续举行了四次。会上对俞平伯研究红楼梦的错误观点和“文艺报”在关于“红楼梦”研究的批评问题上的错误，展开了热烈的批评和讨论。现在，讨论会仍在继续进行中。
    北京大学教师们对俞平伯研究“红楼梦”的错误观点的批判，除中文系已进行了两次座谈外，哲学、历史、西语等系也准备进行讨论。
    中文系教师十日下午三时继续举行座谈。在十日会上发言的有：杨晦、周祖谟、王力、吴组缃、王瑶、季镇淮、吴同宝、钱学熙、任继愈、石峻、田昌玉等。在座谈会上，大家进一步揭露了俞平伯在研究“红楼梦”中的错误观点，批判了胡适派资产阶级唯心论观点在古典文学研究领域中的影响和毒害。有的教授在发言中指出，俞平伯的这种错误观点在北京大学长期未引起注意，是跟教师之间对待错误思想的自由主义态度分不开的。有人平日对俞平伯的研究工作，是有意见的，但从来没有提出来，怕撕破“情面”，不去明辨是非。从对俞平伯的错误观点的批判中，大家认识到认真学习马克思列宁主义是非常迫切和必要的。许多教授也着重检讨了自己在学术研究工作中所犯的资产阶级唯心论观点的错误，迫切要求通过这次讨论，肃清这种危害革命事业、危害学术发展的影响。
      “红楼梦”研究的批判中陆续揭发出关于胡适的反动哲学和文学思想后，北京大学哲学系专业各教研室主任和哲学系系主任共同进行了研究，大家认为胡适的反动的主观唯心论的“实验主义”的思想，不但在文学界需要肃清，而且应该在哲学、历史、教育、考古、语言学等方面进行批判。特别在北京大学，对胡适的反动思想进行批判是完全具有现实意义的。因此，决定组织哲学系各专业的教师们进行批判胡适的反动哲学思想的工作，并初步计划准备以下列三题为重点：批判胡适的反动的资产阶级思想方法；批判胡适的反动的社会政治思想；批判在哲学史研究工作中的胡适的资产阶级思想。并准备在研究有结果时组织讨论或公开发表。
    北京大学文学研究所在最近也召开了全所研究人员的会议，研究开展对胡适派的资产阶级唯心论文学思想的批判，并进一步改进全所的研究工作。文学研究所副所长何其芳在会议上说明了由李希凡、蓝翎开始提出、人民日报号召大家重视的对俞平伯研究“红楼梦”的错误立场、观点、方法的批判的重大意义。他说：俞平伯是文学研究所的研究员，他近年来发表的有关“红楼梦”的文章虽然是个人的业余活动，但所内领导上并未注意这些文章的发表及其影响，没有及时发现问题，在所内展开批评。这是所内工作中存在的严重缺点。他说，应该从这一次暴露出来的工作中的缺点和错误取得经验教训。他建议大家认真阅读和这一次思想斗争有关的重要资料，展开讨论，写文章参加论争，并提出改进研究所工作的意见。会上发言的还有余冠英、蔡仪、范宁、罗大冈、卞之琳、力扬、曹道衡等。大家一致认为不论研究中国或外国文学，都必须反对资产阶级的唯心主义和主观主义，反对“为艺术而艺术”、艺术和政治无关的观点，而针对所内工作的缺点，应该随时注意研究工作现状，加强批评和自我批评。会议并决定全所研究人员对人民日报及各报刊所发表的和这一论争有关的文章进行阅读和讨论。
    中国作家协会文学讲习所，也从十一月一日起，把这次对“红楼梦”研究中的错误观点的批判，作为学习的中心课题。他们计划以三周的时间进行这一学习。目前全体学员和教学人员正在阅读
  “红楼梦”原著和有关批评俞平伯的错误观点的文章。从下周起即将进入小组漫谈和课堂讨论。他们要求通过这一次学习，进一步认清俞平伯研究“红楼梦”的资产阶级唯心论的错误观点和方法，从而树立正确的研读古典文学作品的观点和方法；同时也将通过批评和自我批评，检查并清除自己所沾染的资产阶级思想、作风，检查对待古典文学遗产的不正确的态度。
