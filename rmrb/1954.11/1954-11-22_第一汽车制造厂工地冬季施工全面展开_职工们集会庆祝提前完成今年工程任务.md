Winter construction on a massive scale has fully commenced at the First Automobile Factory construction site.

This year's winter construction tasks at the First Automobile Factory construction site are substantial and complex. From November 1st to the end of March next year, the workload is equivalent to 24.1% of this year's factory area construction workload. The construction projects include cast-in-place concrete, bricklaying, various floor surface layers, excavation, backfilling, concrete component hoisting, steel structure hoisting, floor and soil insulation, industrial pipelines, and other engineering.

To ensure the smooth progress of winter construction, the construction site's leadership organized training classes for temperature measurement personnel and technical cadres leading winter construction, starting in mid-October, training a total of 160 grassroots construction management cadres. Various construction sites also conducted technical exchanges on winter construction, studied winter construction regulations, and invited Soviet experts to explain winter construction technical measures, technical safety precautions, and various specific construction methods.

The construction site is now a scene of winter. Workers are wearing cold-proof clothing and gloves. Warm sheds have been erected over the buildings in various work areas, and dump trucks transporting concrete have been equipped with insulation equipment. Heating boilers are being installed and will soon be able to supply heat. Currently, the concrete coming from the mixing station has calcium chloride added to it, and after pouring, it is immediately covered with straw mats to accelerate the concrete's solidification. Many places have also adopted advanced Soviet warm shed methods, electric heating methods, and heat storage methods, and the "freezing method" is used in bricklaying projects.

The cold weather cannot suppress the enthusiasm of the people building the First Automobile Factory. New achievements are constantly emerging. The people of the Third Squad of the Twelfth Team in the foundry construction site exceeded their mold making and installation tasks by 240%, while the Wang Yongde team, which was responsible for transporting earth, completed 132% of their planned task. Workers building the car body pressing workshop embraced large frozen clay chunks that couldn't be scooped with shovels, carrying them with their hands and on their shoulders. Crane operators at the mechanized supply station completed the hoisting of two massive cooling towers, each 40 meters high, ahead of schedule.

The Engineering Company directly under the Architectural Engineering Department, which is responsible for the construction of the First Automobile Factory, held a celebration meeting on the afternoon of the 19th to celebrate the early completion of the 1954 engineering tasks. At the meeting, outstanding units and model teams and groups in the factory construction project over the past year were rewarded.

The recipients of the awards included the construction assembly workshop, the car body pressing workshop, and the concrete mixing plant, a total of three work area units, and seventeen advanced model teams and groups, who received the mobile red banner and pennant awards. These award-winning units played a significant role in completing this year's construction plan. The workers building the car body pressing workshop grasped the importance of plan management in completing their construction tasks, ensuring the monthly overfulfillment of the monthly plan since the start of construction. By October 12th, they had completed 101.2% of the annual plan. The mixing plant ensured the supply of concrete to various work areas, with an attendance rate of 98.1%.

Many model deeds have emerged in this year's factory construction task. The Liu Jingshan model team in the auxiliary workshop created 15 kinds of tools in a year, including an electric plastering machine that increased efficiency by 15 times. Xue Yungao of the motorcycle workshop set a new work area record by laying 4,388 bricks in one day, exceeding the newly established state quota by 134%.

At the meeting, the company leaders reported to all employees, urging everyone to prevent complacency, overcome the difficulties of the severe cold, and strive to complete winter construction tasks ahead of schedule under the comprehensive policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe."

    第一汽车制造厂工地冬季施工全面展开
    职工们集会庆祝提前完成今年工程任务
    规模巨大的冬季施工已在第一汽车制造厂工地全面展开。
    今年第一汽车制造厂工地冬季的施工任务很大，又很复杂，从十一月一日到明年三月底，工程量相当于今年厂区施工工作量的百分之二十四点一。施工项目有就地浇灌混凝土、砌墙、各种地坪面层、挖土、回填土，混凝土构件装吊、钢结构装吊、地坪和土壤保温、工业管道等工程。
    为保证冬季施工的顺利进行，工地的领导机关从十月中旬就举办了测温人员和领导冬季施工的技术干部训练班，先后训练了一百六十多名基层施工管理干部。各工地也进行了冬季施工的技术交流，和学习了冬季施工规则，并请苏联专家讲解冬季施工技术措施、技术保安和各种具体施工方法等。
    施工现场，现在已是一片冬季景象。工人们都穿起了防寒服装，戴起了手套。各工区的建筑物上搭起了暖棚，运输混凝土的自卸汽车也装备起了保温设备。供暖的锅炉正在安装，不日就可供应暖气。现在，搅拌站送出来的混凝土都加上了氯化钙，浇灌后立刻盖起草垫子，以加速混凝土的凝固。许多地方还采用了苏联的先进暖棚法、电热法、蓄热法，在砌砖工程中使用了“冻结法”。
    寒冷的天气，压不倒建设第一汽车制造厂的人们的热情。新的成绩在不断涌现。建设铸工场的十二中队三班的人们，在制做木模和安装任务中超额百分之二百四十完成了任务，抬运土方的王永德小组完成了计划任务的百分之一百三十二。建设车身压制工场的职工，在搬运冻结了的大块粘土中，用铁锹装不上筐，他们就用手抱，用肩膀驮。机械化供应站的起重工，提前完成了高达四十公尺的两座巨大冷却塔的装吊任务。
    担负建设第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司，在十九日下午召开了提前完成一九五四年工程任务的庆祝大会。会上对一年来在建厂工程中的优秀单位和模范班、小组进行了奖励。
    这次受奖的有建筑装配工场、车身压制工场和混凝土搅拌厂三个工区单位，十七个先进模范班组，得到了流动大红旗和锦旗的奖励。这些受奖的单位，在完成今年施工计划中起了很大的作用。建设车身压制工场的职工，在完成施工任务中，抓住了计划管理的重要环节，从开工以来，保证了月计划的月月超额完成。到十月十二日止，他们以百分之一百零一点二完成了全年计划。搅拌厂保证了各工区混凝土的供应，出勤率达到百分之九十八点一。
    在今年建厂任务中，并涌现出许多的模范事迹。辅助工场的刘景山模范小组，一年中创造了十五种工具，其中创造的电动抹灰器就提高效率十五倍。摩托工场的薛云高创造了一天砌砖四千三百八十八块，突破工区最高纪录，超过国家新定额百分之一百三十四。
    在大会上，公司领导人员对全体职工作了报告，要大家防止骄傲自满，克服严寒的困难，在“好、快、省、安全”的全面方针之下，争取提前完成冬季施工任务。（正康　丁水）（附图片）
