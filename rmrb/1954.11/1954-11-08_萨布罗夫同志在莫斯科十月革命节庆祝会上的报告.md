Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS):

    Comrades!
    Today, the Soviet people and the working people of the world are celebrating the thirty-seventh anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in world history—an era of humanity's transition to a life of freedom, peace, and happiness.
    Thirty-seven years ago, the working class of our country, in alliance with the laboring peasantry, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by the genius of mankind, V.I. Lenin, completed the socialist revolution. As a result of the victory of this revolution, the rule of landlords and capitalists was overthrown, and the world's first Soviet socialist state was established. Our people have become the true masters of their own destiny, people who are consciously building a new and free life.
    The great strength and invincibility of the October Socialist Revolution lies in the fact that it enables the working people to fully develop their abilities and fully demonstrate their creative role as the true creators of history. The October Revolution and the establishment of socialism in our country have shown that the great masses of the people play a decisive role in winning the victory over the old world and in building a socialist society.
    The October Revolution is of epoch-making significance not only for our people but also for the people of the world. It has pointed out the path to liberation from imperialist enslavement for the oppressed people of the world. It has established in the consciousness of the working people of all countries the confidence in their strength and the confidence that their cause will surely triumph.
    The idea that the October Revolution raised the banner of peace and pointed out the way out of the First World War will forever remain in the memory of all nations. The first thing the Soviet people did after seizing power was to issue the historic Decree on Peace, drafted by the great Lenin.
    The people of all nationalities in our country, united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, are greeting the thirty-seventh anniversary of the great October Revolution with new developments in our economy and culture. The achievements of the Soviet people inspire the working people of the people's democratic countries, strengthen the unity of the people of all countries, and strengthen the fighting solidarity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace and democracy.
    In the year since the thirty-sixth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people have made new achievements in all aspects of communist construction. These achievements demonstrate that the policy formulated by the Communist Party and the Soviet government based on a deep understanding of the laws of social development aims at further vigorously developing the productive forces of Soviet society and improving the material and cultural welfare of the working people.
    The heroic labor of the Soviet people has ensured the continuous improvement of our socialist industry. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that industrial production should increase by approximately 70 percent in five years. Judging from the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, industrial production will increase by 63 percent from 1950 in four years (1951 to 1954). This means that the Five-Year Plan in industry will be completed ahead of schedule.
    The Five-Year Plan for the volume of freight turnover in railway transportation will also be completed ahead of schedule.
    In the past ten months of 1954, our industry has overfulfilled the state plan. Industrial output in this period of 1954 has increased by more than 12 percent compared with the same period last year.
    The great Lenin formulated the basic principles for building a communist society. He pointed out that heavy industry is the foundation of the socialist economy. Without heavy industry, it is impossible to equip the entire national economy with new, fully modernized technology, nor can we guarantee the independence and autonomy of our motherland. Therefore, our party and the Soviet government have taken measures to rapidly develop the production of metals, electricity, fuels, and machines. In 1954, the total industrial output of the country will increase to 2.8 times that of 1940, while during the same period, the output of heavy industry will increase to 3.4 times.
    The most important condition for the development of various sectors of the national economy is the further electrification of the country. In 1954, electricity production will increase to three times that of 1940. In the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, large hydropower stations such as the Upper Svir, Tsimlyansk, Shirokovskaya, Gorky, Matkozhin, Mingechaur, and part of the Kama Hydropower Station have all generated electricity. The world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the Volga River are under full construction. Hydropower stations on the Angara River, Ob River, and other places are also under construction.
    Based on the achievements in the development of heavy industry and transportation, the Party and the government have formulated a broad plan to increase the production of consumer goods in order to fully meet the growing needs of the working masses in the coming years. This plan has already begun to be implemented this year. In 1954, more than 5.5 billion meters of cotton fabrics will be produced, which is 6 percent more than in 1953 and 43 percent more than in 1950; 242 million meters of woolen fabrics will be produced, which is 17 percent more than in 1953 and 56 percent more than in 1950; and 520 million meters of silk fabrics will be produced, which is 30 percent more than in 1953 and three times more than in 1950. This year, the production of other consumer goods will also be greatly increased.
    The task of the Party and the government is to produce more high-quality industrial products and food.
    Ensuring the rapid development of all sectors of socialist agriculture is the main link in solving the historical task of drastically increasing the production of consumer goods. The resolutions of the September 1953 Plenary Session and the February-March and June 1954 Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulate some necessary and urgent measures to ensure the rapid development of agriculture. The most important measures are: increasing the yield per unit area of all crops, using land and machinery more fully and rationally, reclaiming large areas of fertile virgin and fallow land, increasing grain production, increasing the number of livestock and increasing the productivity of livestock, strengthening the role of machine tractor stations in the development of collective farm production, and striving to develop the production of state farms. Further strengthening collective farms organizationally and economically is of great significance. The implementation of these measures will make it possible to eliminate the backwardness of some sectors in agriculture and animal husbandry in the shortest possible time.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are fighting with unparalleled enthusiasm to realize these measures. More than 150,000 skilled workers, engineers, agronomists, and livestock breeders have voluntarily gone to work in collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in reclamation areas.
    The Soviet government is constantly increasing the supply of machinery to various sectors of agricultural production every year, sending a large number of the latest equipment to collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. In the nine months of 1954 alone, agriculture received 134,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 61,000 trucks, 28,000 grain harvesting combines, more than 19,000 tractor-drawn and self-propelled mowers, 9,000 potato harvesting combines, and a large number of other machines.
    This year, our country has made great achievements in the development of agriculture. In 1954, the total sown area of the country was expanded by 13 percent compared with 1950. This year, the climate in some areas of the country (Southern Ukraine and the Volga River Basin) was unfavorable for crop growth. Nevertheless, due to the implementation of the great plan formulated by the Party and the government to increase yield per unit area and reclaim virgin and fallow land, the total grain harvest in 1954 will still be greater than in 1953. In Western Siberia, the total grain harvest will double that of last year, of which the Altai Territory is almost four times that of last year, and the Kazakh Republic will increase by about 35 percent compared with last year.
    Agricultural laborers have established glorious achievements this year. They have greatly overfulfilled the state plan for reclaiming new land, which is supported by the people of the whole country. The plan for reclaiming virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and the North Caucasus in 1954-1955 was completed by 120 percent this year, reclaiming nearly 17 million hectares of virgin and fallow land, and the plan for sowing crops on virgin and fallow land was completed by 157 percent.
    Based on existing experience and practical possibilities, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have passed a resolution to greatly expand the work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and have put forward a significant task: by 1956, the sown area of newly reclaimed land will increase to 28 million to 30 million hectares, which is about equal to the total sown area of France and Italy.
    Further development of animal husbandry is of great significance to the country. In the past year, the number of livestock of various products has also increased. As everyone knows, on January 1, 1953, the total number of dairy cows in the country was 24.3 million, while on October 1, 1954, the total number of dairy cows had increased to 27.5 million, an increase of more than 3 million, and it will nearly reach the total number of dairy cows before the Patriotic War. In the past year, the total number of cattle, pigs, and sheep privately owned by collective farm members and employees has also increased. However, the urgent interests of the country require all Party and Soviet organizations to pay more attention to the development of animal husbandry.
    It is intolerable that, because the preparations for livestock wintering were unsatisfactory last year, the total number of livestock in collective farms in some areas has not only not increased, but has even decreased in some cases.
    In order to get through the upcoming winter, it is necessary to establish the necessary feed reserves, to fully maintain young livestock, and to increase the productivity of livestock in order to increase the production of meat, oil, milk, wool, and other products necessary for residents.
    The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition that opened this year vividly shows the great strength and vitality of socialist agriculture. The exhibition is a school for the whole people, it promotes the achievements of Soviet agricultural science, promotes the advanced experience of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and promotes the experience of production innovators. We still have many backward collective farms that do not use land well and rationally, and the yield of crops and the productivity of livestock are very low. The great significance of the exhibition lies in the fact that it promotes the advanced working methods of advanced farms, thereby helping to promote these methods in all other collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.
    The achievements in the development of industry and agriculture have led to a further improvement in the material welfare of the working people. The Communist Party and the Soviet government believe that the main task in domestic policy is to maximize the satisfaction of the growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people.
    In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the number of employees in the Soviet national economy has greatly increased, and will increase to 47 million by the end of 1954. At the same time, the real wages of employees will also increase by about 74 percent compared with 1940. If the increase in the state's expenditure on cultural and social welfare for residents is included, the total income of employees has almost doubled during this period. The Soviet government has systematically taken measures to improve the people's living standards, especially in reducing the national retail commodity prices. In the period from 1947 to 1954, the retail prices have been reduced seven times in succession. As a result, the retail prices in 1954 were 56.52 percent lower than in 1947.
    The prices on the collective farm market have decreased by almost three-quarters during the same period, which has greatly increased the people's purchasing power. Therefore, measures must be taken to further expand the volume of commodity circulation and increase the production of consumer goods. The increase in the output of consumer goods has greatly increased the quantity of consumer goods supplied to residents. Compared with 1950, the quantity of retail consumer goods in 1954 has increased as follows: meat products and sugar have increased by about 1.9 times, fish products and animal oil have increased by about 1.6 times, vegetable oil has increased by about 2 times, cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, linen fabrics, and silk fabrics have increased by 66 percent, and furniture has increased by 2.9 times.
    Improving the living conditions of the working people plays a great role in improving the material welfare of the working people. This Five-Year Plan stipulates that the amount of investment in residential construction will increase by about two times compared with the previous Five-Year Plan. And in these four years, the amount of investment in residential construction has increased by 1.8 times. In four years, the total area of newly built houses in state residential construction in cities and villages will reach 86 million square meters. In addition, the total area of new houses built at their own expense by residents of cities and workers' residential areas with the help of state loans will reach 30 million square meters. However, these achievements that have already been made cannot meet our growing needs. The Communist Party and the Soviet government will continue to strive to further improve the living conditions of the working people. The continuous increase in the employee social insurance fund and the social insurance fund for residents also proves the improvement in the living standards of the working people. Due to the general development of the collective farm's public economy, the increase in the purchase and acquisition prices of agricultural products, the reduction in tax amounts, and the cancellation of accumulated debts in the past few years, the actual income of farmers has increased this year.
    Much has also been achieved in improving the cultural level of the Soviet working people. The number of students in primary and secondary schools, secondary technical schools, and universities is increasing year by year. This year, universities enrolled more than 450,000 new freshmen, which is the largest number of students enrolled in the history of our universities.
    The Party and the government tirelessly strive to develop Soviet science, ensure the prosperity of socialist culture, literature, and art, and increase the spiritual wealth of our people.
    Lenin taught us that communism is the result of the conscious transformation activities of the masses of the people. Socialist consciousness accelerates the forward development of Soviet society. Therefore, the Communist Party attaches great importance to the active struggle against the bourgeois ideological remnants and all capitalist vestiges in the consciousness of the Soviet people. Our Soviet literature plays a major role in the communist education of the working people. Its mission is to instill communist ideas into the masses, point out the advanced and progressive things, criticize the backward things, and reflect the interests of the people, the heroism of the people, the spirit of self-sacrifice, and creative efforts. The upcoming Second All-Soviet Writers Congress is a major event in our social life, which will formulate new tasks in order to more effectively develop Soviet literature.
    Whether the tasks set by the Party and the government for further developing industry and agriculture and improving the material welfare and cultural level of the people can be victoriously completed depends on our work, depends on our correct organization of work, and depends on whether we are good at using all our abilities and internal potential. It should be remembered that any resolution, no matter how well formulated, cannot complete the tasks if it is not carried out with active and unremitting struggle.
    The Soviet people welcome the measures taken by the Party and the government to further develop our country's economy with great satisfaction and respond to them with new production enthusiasm. The Party, Soviet, and trade union organizations should lead the creativity of the masses and give play to their creativity, and more widely carry out competition in industry and agriculture to strive to complete the production plan, strive to improve labor productivity and reduce costs, strive to produce high-quality products, and practice strict economy.
    Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system. This principle of Lenin's is known to everyone. V.I. Lenin particularly emphasized the great significance of improving labor productivity for ensuring our country's transition to communism.
    Compared with last year, labor productivity in industry in 1954 has increased by about 7 percent; compared with 1950, it has increased by 33 percent. However, it must be admitted that this rate of increase in labor productivity is not enough. In some industrial sectors, in the construction industry, and in agriculture, a large number of excellent machines have not been fully utilized, not enough has been done in widely adopting the latest scientific and technological achievements, very poor work has been done in correcting the shortcomings in labor and production organization, and advanced experience has been promoted very slowly.
    One of the major shortcomings in industry is that the production of some enterprises is very unbalanced. Many factories do not work rhythmically, and production is very unbalanced in a month. In the first half of the month, the level of work of the enterprise is much lower than in the second half of the month, which has an adverse impact on the improvement of labor productivity in industry.
    The Party and the government believe that the most important task in industry is to ensure that industrial enterprises work more evenly, and to ensure that every factory, mine, and railway completes the production plan.
    Our non-productive expenditures are still very high, the expenses for maintaining management agencies are too large, and there are not a few facts of treating people's property with a non-master attitude and negligently, and not being good at correctly using the potential hidden in socialist production.
    It is necessary to resolutely fight against the shortcomings in work, bravely expose these shortcomings and strive to eliminate them, and be good at overcoming any difficulties. Our strength lies in the fact that we are not afraid to expose and criticize our own shortcomings. Sincerely admitting our shortcomings and eradicating these shortcomings in a timely manner will help to consolidate our Soviet system even more.
    The tasks of further developing the socialist economy require us to strengthen labor discipline, strictly manage the amount of labor and consumption, adhere unswervingly to the principle of distribution according to work, and increase the material interests of employees in order to improve labor productivity and promote the public economy.
    At the same time, it is particularly important for socialist society to correctly allocate labor so that this labor is mainly concentrated in the production sector, namely, factories, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. At present, when the Soviet people are solving the task of continuously improving the people's consumption level, increasing the labor force in the production sector and reducing the labor force in the non-production sector is of great significance. To this end, we are implementing the policy of reducing state organs and simplifying the organization of institutions.
    Following Lenin's principle of managing the country, the Party and the government strive to reduce the expenses of our state organs as much as possible and bring them as close to the masses as possible. The Party and the government are fighting to eradicate bureaucracy, red tape, and other bureaucratic manifestations in our state organs, and are striving to consolidate the connection between all links of the organs and the broad masses of the working people.
    Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, pointed out more than once that the alliance between the working class and the laboring peasants is the foundation for strengthening and consolidating the Soviet system. Lenin believed that the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the peasants is a supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and this principle is the endless source of all our strength in victoriously solving the tasks of communist construction. The various measures taken by the Party and the government to further develop industry and agriculture and improve the people's welfare will make the alliance between the working class and the peasants even more consolidated and enhance the economic and political power of the Soviet state.
    One of the greatest achievements of the October Socialist Revolution is the establishment and consolidation of the multi-ethnic Soviet state. The October Revolution liberated the many nationalities of Russia, freed them from national oppression, and created conditions for the economic, political, and cultural upsurge of all nationalities living in our great motherland. The Party and the Soviet state have consistently implemented the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, thereby promoting the economic and cultural upsurge of all nationalities in our country and uniting all nationalities in our country into a unified, fraternal family. This was particularly clearly demonstrated when the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union celebrated the significant historical day - the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia this year. This is not only a grand festival for the Ukrainian and Russian people, but also a grand festival for the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, united under the banner of proletarian internationalism in an unbreakable friendship.
    Our internal situation is more stable than ever before. All Soviet people are laboring with firm determination for the further prosperity of the socialist motherland. The unity of the people around the Party and the government, the unbreakable unity in spirit and politics, is the guarantee for the Soviet Union's victorious advance along the road of building a communist society.
    Our country's large-scale economic and cultural construction, and the measures consistently taken by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to continuously improve the material welfare of the Soviet people, clearly confirm the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy.
    Due to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, a country has been born for the first time in human history whose domestic and foreign policies are entirely for the interests of the masses of the people, the cause of peace, and the security of the people. The basis of this policy, determined by the great Lenin, is that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist peacefully as long as both sides have the desire to cooperate, are willing to fulfill their obligations, and abide by the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The facts in international relations over the past thirty-seven years have convincingly shown that countries with different social systems can fully carry out mutually beneficial cooperation in economic, political, and cultural aspects. It is entirely possible to carry out such cooperation in the future to benefit the consolidation of peace throughout the world. As long as it depends on the Soviet Union, then it can be said without any doubt that the Soviet Union will continue to establish relations with other countries on the basis of recognizing the above-mentioned principles regarding relations between countries.
    If this effort by the Soviet Union can be responded to by other countries, and they also make the same effort, then the cause of peace can be victorious.
    Striving for peace and international security has always been the basis of the Soviet government's foreign policy. We are deeply convinced that such a policy not only conforms to the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the countries in the democratic camp, but also conforms to the interests of the people of all other countries, large and small.
    However, it would be wrong to regard the Soviet Union's desire for peace as a sign of its weakness. The Soviet state has proved more than once with iron facts that it is capable of defending its interests and security. When needed, the Soviet people are able to take up arms to resist any aggressor to defend themselves. There is no need to repeat those well-known facts. There is no doubt that these facts are well-known not only to our friends, but also to our enemies. Therefore, it cannot but be surprising that some figures in the United States want to deal with the Soviet Union with a so-called "policy of strength." This method has never succeeded in dealing with the Soviet Union. This approach is also foolish because even the enemies of the Soviet Union now admit that the strength of the Soviet Union has been further strengthened, and standing with the Soviet Union to fight for peace is also the great power of Asia - the People's Republic of China, and all the people's democratic countries that have steadily embarked on the road of building socialism and are standing side by side with the Soviet Union at the forefront of the forces of peace and progress. The people of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been advancing victoriously along this road for ten years. In these ten years, the face of these countries has been completely renewed. The victory of the new system has created huge and unprecedented possibilities for the economic and cultural development of the people's democratic countries of Europe. The working people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania, who have embarked on the road of building socialism, have achieved great achievements in their creative work in all their departments.
    The diplomatic position of these countries has undergone a fundamental change, and their role on the international stage has been strengthened. For decades, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been the target of conspiracies and provocations by imperialist countries, and have often been used by them as pawns in their aggressive policies. This situation is gone forever. The people's democratic countries of Europe, which have gained true independence, are actively engaged in the struggle for international peace.
    This October, the progressive forces of Germany solemnly celebrated the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic - a truly democratic and peace-loving country.
    Not only Germany, but also places far away from Germany celebrated this major festival. This is understandable because the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, its economic and political achievements, is a very important factor in the German people's struggle to build their unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, and is an important factor in the struggle for peace and security in Europe and the world.
    The People's Republic of China recently celebrated its fifth anniversary of founding. The establishment of a free and independent People's Republic of China is not only a major event in Chinese history, but also a major event in the history of all mankind. This is a fact of historical significance, and no matter how high an estimate is given to its significance, it will not be excessive. The Soviet people are cheered and inspired by the historically significant achievements of the 600 million fraternal Chinese people, and by their achievements in establishing and consolidating their country's people's democratic system. The great achievements of People's China have already been fixed in legal form in the constitution recently adopted at the National People's Congress - the constitution that declares the principles of building socialism in China.
    The era when foreign imperialists colluded with the decadent Chinese reactionaries to oppress the great Chinese people and prevent them from independently participating in the resolution of international issues is gone forever. No matter how the international reactionaries - first and foremost the American aggression groups - oppose it, the People's Republic of China has firmly appeared on the international stage as a truly great power and a strong factor for peace.
    Unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation link the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union together. For the people of all countries who are advancing along the road opened up by the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union's socialist construction is a source of extremely rich experience.
    The powerful democratic and socialist camp has united 900 million people under its banner, and its unwavering struggle for peace has gained the increasingly widespread sympathy and active support of people from all walks of life in capitalist countries. This is a direct manifestation of the greatest historical transformation of modern times - the fact that the people of all countries are increasingly grasping the cause of peace in their own hands.
    The consistent and purposeful struggle of the forces of peace, led by the Soviet Union, has recently produced some positive results. A dangerous source of war has been cleared up in Korea. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have ended the hostilities in Indochina, which makes it possible to find a final solution to the Indochina issue, taking full account of the legitimate national interests of the people of all countries in Indochina. The achievements of the Geneva Conference have clearly shown that the national liberation movement of the people of the East is invincible, and have shown the growing strength of the peace camp and the effectiveness of the method of resolving outstanding international issues through diplomatic negotiations.
    Recently, the economic and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and other countries have developed considerably, and are continuing to develop, which undoubtedly helps to normalize the overall international situation. Recently, relations between our country and Yugoslavia have improved. Some obstacles that hindered the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have been removed, and steps have been taken to restore trade and establish cultural and other ties. The Yugoslav government has expressed its willingness to cooperate in improving relations with the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet government, it believes that it is in the interests of the people of both countries to seize all opportunities to establish normal and friendly relations. The discord and hostility that have arisen between our two countries in recent years have only benefited the enemies of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and have benefited the enemies of peace. Conversely, cooperation and sincere friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia not only fully conforms to the interests of our two countries, but also conforms to the needs of world peace. The Soviet government will continue to promote the complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in every way, and promote the consolidation of the long-standing friendship between our people and the fraternal Yugoslav people, and hopes to receive full understanding from Yugoslavia in the process of doing so.
    The broad public in various countries increasingly understands and supports the Soviet government's well-known argument that it is possible and necessary to resolve international disputes through agreements among the countries concerned in order to strengthen peace and ensure the free development of all countries.
    The people of the whole world are extremely satisfied with the achievements made in easing international tensions, which has given them greater confidence in their strength and ability to prevent another war and safeguard the cause of peace.
    The Soviet people are convinced that the possibilities for further easing international tensions have not been fully utilized, and only preliminary steps have been taken in this regard. At the same time, we are also clearly aware that the aggressors of some countries have also laid down serious obstacles in this path. These elements are constantly engaging in new conspiracies to prevent the further easing of international tensions, and continue to piece together military blocs aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Such blocs are being established in Europe, Asia, and other regions of the world, and while establishing these blocs, the United States always wants to establish new bases on the territory of other countries thousands of kilometers away from its borders.
    Because strengthening peace, reducing armaments, and banning atomic and hydrogen weapons have become one of the most important and urgent issues, the resolution of these issues can greatly reduce military expenditures and tax burdens
  (this burden has now completely fallen on the working people). This will undoubtedly greatly improve the overall international situation.
    The discovery and use of atomic energy is a great achievement of human genius, and it has opened up broad prospects for the further development of social productive forces. However, as everyone knows, powerful groups in some countries are trying their best to make atomic energy serve war plans. The vital interests of the people of all countries require a strict ban on the use of atomic energy for the destruction and mass slaughter of mankind, and require that this powerful natural force be used entirely for constructive purposes to promote human progress.
    As everyone knows, Soviet science has made outstanding achievements in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and the Soviet atomic power station has begun to generate electricity.
    The Soviet Union is unremittingly striving to ban atomic weapons. Directly related to this position of the Soviet Union is that the Soviet delegation has submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion a draft of the basic provisions of an international convention on banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction and eliminating these weapons from the armaments of all countries, on drastically reducing armaments, and on establishing international supervision to implement these resolutions. The Soviet proposals stipulate
  some specific and practical measures to resolve these issues.
    We can point out with great satisfaction that the Soviet Union's new proposals have been endorsed by the broadest public opinion in the world. But at the same time, it must be admitted that it is not enough to simply issue some statements on the importance of the Soviet government's recent proposals. It is necessary to carry out the struggle more resolutely and actively, to oppose attempts to create new stalemates and artificially hinder the reaching of agreements in resolving these issues, and to oppose attempts to ignore the fact that the opinions of various countries are converging in the negotiations on these important issues.
    It is impossible to seriously negotiate disarmament while at the same time opening the door to the revanchist forces of West Germany to revive German militarism. The people of Europe still have vivid memories of the days of Hitler's bloody rule.
    Judging from the recent developments, the tricks played by the advocates of reviving West German militarism will only arouse the indignation of public opinion, and will not produce any other consequences. In this regard, one cannot ignore the resolutions on the German issue adopted at the unilateral meetings in London and Paris by Western countries.
    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have violated the obligation to jointly prevent the revival of German militarism with the Soviet Union, and have disregarded the wishes of the people of all countries for peace, and have concluded a unilateral agreement with West German militarists and revanchists to restore the West German Wehrmacht. The Paris Agreement, which remilitarizes West Germany, stipulates the establishment of a 500,000-strong West German army in the first phase. However, even now, the Bonn government has made no secret of its plan to establish legions and divisions that are much larger in number than stipulated in the Paris Agreement.
    West Germany's industry - including the Ruhr military industry, which was once the arsenal of Hitler's Germany - has been readjusted to serve West Germany's rearmament. It is by no means accidental that there are a large number of militaristic and fascist books everywhere in West Germany, and these books openly advocate launching another war against Germany's European neighbors. It is these people who were yesterday the organizers of Hitler's war of aggression against France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, who are now wielding more and more power in West Germany.
    Therefore, the London and Paris agreements will turn West Germany into a militarist country. Nor should one ignore the fact that, according to the Paris Agreement, the West German army will be able to possess atomic weapons. In addition, the agreement directly stipulates that work will be carried out in West Germany in the field of atomic research.
    The governments of the capitalist countries of Western Europe have apparently forgotten that arming West Germany would pose a great threat to the people of Europe and even to all mankind, because the rulers of West Germany, who are imbued with militaristic ideas, will soon possess atomic weapons in addition to other types of weapons, and there is no doubt that they will want to use these weapons to achieve their goals of revenge and aggression.
    Some short-sighted political figures in Western Europe are propagating a false argument that the ratification of the London and Paris agreements will increase the chances of the four countries reaching an agreement on the German issue. Only people who have no brains will believe this statement. In reality, the ratification and implementation of the Paris and London agreements will create new obstacles to reaching an agreement on the German issue, will deepen the current division of Germany, and will place the German nation in a state of dismemberment.
    For the sake of European peace and the interests of the German people themselves, it is necessary to immediately restore the unity of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and it is necessary to establish a European collective security system. For this interest, it is also necessary to ensure that no exclusive military bloc is organized with the participation of a remilitarized West Germany, but rather to establish a collective security system in Europe. Such a security system, established on the basis of the joint efforts of all European countries, conforms to the vital interests of the people of all countries in the world, because maintaining European peace plays a decisive role in defending world peace.
    The Soviet people firmly believe that only such a solution to international issues, which soberly estimates the historically significant changes that have taken place in the world, can stand the test of real life. We believe that we should adhere to the principles that can be accepted by and are beneficial to countries with different social systems to resolve some outstanding international issues in Europe and Asia.
    Comrades! The longer the great October Socialist Revolution is away from our time, the more fully and comprehensively its enormous transformative influence on the fate of the entire human history is revealed.
    The glorious thirty-seven-year history of the Soviet state has proven with invincible force the unparalleled superiority of socialism over capitalism; this thirty-seven-year history is a true victory for the all-conquering doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    Our path is correct. There is no force in the world that can stop us from continuing to advance on the correct path. The fraternal Chinese people and the millions of people in the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia are advancing along the path pointed out by the great October Revolution together with us. All progressive mankind warmly sympathizes with our common cause of struggling for peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The Soviet people are rightfully proud of their great historical mission and are full of determination to overcome all obstacles on their path and strive for greater achievements in building communism.
    Long live the victorious banner of the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the great Soviet people - the fighting vanguard of all progressive mankind!
    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which confidently leads our country to communism!
    Long live international peace!

    萨布罗夫同志在莫斯科十月革命节庆祝会上的报告同志们：
    今天苏联人民和全世界劳动人民都在庆祝为世界历史开辟了一个新纪元——使人类过渡到自由、和平和幸福的生活的纪元——的伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。
    三十七年以前，我国的工人阶级同劳动农民结成联盟，在以人类的天才乌·伊·列宁为首的共产党的领导下，完成了社会主义革命。由于这个革命的胜利，推翻了地主和资本家的统治，建立了世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家。我国人民已成为自己命运的真正主人，成为自觉地建立新的自由生活的人。
  十月社会主义革命的伟大力量和不可战胜性在于：它使劳动人民有可能充分发挥他们的能力，充分表现他们作为历史的真正创造者的创造性的作用。十月革命和我国社会主义的建立表明了：在赢得对旧世界的胜利方面，在建立社会主义社会方面，起决定性作用的是伟大的人民群众。
    十月革命不仅对我国人民，而且对全世界人民都具有头等重要的划时代的意义。它已向全世界被压迫人民指出了从帝国主义奴役下解放出来的道路，它已在一切国家的劳动人民的意识中确定了对他们的力量的信心和对他们的事业一定能获得胜利的信心。
    十月革命举起了和平的旗帜，并指出了摆脱第一次世界大战的出路，这种观念永远保留在各国人民的记忆中。苏联人民在取得了政权之后所做的第一件事就是发表了伟大列宁所拟定的具有历史意义的和平法令。
    团结在共产党和苏联政府周围的我国各族人民在我国经济和文化有了新发展的情形下迎接伟大十月革命的三十七周年。苏联人民的成就鼓舞了人民民主国家的劳动人民，加强了世界各国人民的一致，加强了世界各国人民在争取和平和民主的斗争中的战斗团结。
  在十月革命三十六周年之后的一年中，苏联人民在共产主义建设的各个方面都取得了新的成就。这些成就说明：共产党和苏联政府根据对社会发展规律的深刻了解所制定的政策的目的是：进一步大力发展苏维埃社会的生产力并改善劳动人民的物质和文化福利。
    苏联人民的英勇劳动保证了我国社会主义工业的不断提高。第五个五年计划规定，在五年中要使工业产品增加约百分之七十。从执行五年计划的情况来看，在四年中（一九五一年到一九五四年）工业产品将比一九五零年增加百分之六十三。这就是说，工业方面的五年计划将提前完成。
    铁路运输的货物周转量的五年计划也将提前完成。
    在一九五四年的过去十个月中，我国工业已超额完成了国家计划。一九五四年这一时期的工业产量已比去年同一时期增加了百分之十二以上。
    伟大的列宁制定了建设共产主义社会的基本原则，他指出，重工业是社会主义经济的基础的基础，没有重工业就不能以新的、完全现代化的技术装备整个国民经济，也不能保障我们祖国的独立和自主。因此，我们党和苏联政府采取了措施，使金属、电力、燃料、机器的生产得以迅速的发展。一九五四年，全国的工业总产量将增加为一九四零年的二点八倍，而在同一期间，重工业的产量则将增加为三点四倍。
    国民经济各部门发展的最重要的条件就是全国进一步的电气化。一九五四年，电力的生产将增为一九四零年的三倍。在第五个五年计划的头四年中，上斯维尔、齐姆良、石山口、戈莫什、马特科日宁、明格查乌尔等大水电站和卡马水电站的一部分都已发电了。伏尔加河上世界最大的古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站正在全力建设中。安加拉河、鄂毕河和其他地方的水电站也在建设中。
    党和政府根据重工业和运输业发展的成就，制订了一个提高消费品生产的广泛计划，以便在最近几年内充分满足劳动群众日益增长的需要。这个计划今年已开始实施了。一九五四年将生产五十五亿多公尺的棉织品，即比一九五三年多百分之六，比一九五零年多百分之四十三；生产两亿四千二百万公尺毛织品，即比一九五三年多百分之十七，比一九五零年多百分之五十六；并将生产五亿二千万公尺丝织品，即比一九五三年多百分之三十，比一九五零年多三倍。今年，其他消费品的生产也将大大增加。
    党和政府的任务在于要生产更多的质量高的工业品和食品。
    保证社会主义农业各部门得到尽速的发展，是解决急剧增加消费品生产这一历史任务的主要环节。苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议和一九五四年二—三月和六月全体会议的决议规定了一些必需的和迫切的措施，以保证农业的迅速发展。其中最重要的措施是：提高一切农作物的单位面积产量，更加充分和合理地使用土地和机器，开垦大量肥沃的生荒地和熟荒地，增加谷物生产，增加牲畜的头数并提高牲畜的产品生产率，加强机器拖拉机站在发展集体农庄生产中的作用，尽力发展国营农场的生产。进一步在组织上和经济上加强集体农庄具有重大的意义。实行这些措施，就可能在最短时期内消除农业和畜牧业中一些部门的落后现象。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正以无比的热情为实现这些措施而奋斗。有十五万以上的熟练工人、工程师、农艺师和饲畜师已自愿地到开垦地区的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中工作。
    苏联政府每年都在不断增加对农业生产各部门的机器供应，把大量最新式的装备送到集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场去。单在一九五四年九个月内，农业就得到了十三万四千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），六万一千部卡车，二万八千台谷物收割联合机，一万九千多台拖拉机牵引的和自动的割草机，九千台马铃薯收获联合机和大量其他机器。
    今年我国在发展农业方面获得了巨大的成就。一九五四年全国的播种面积比一九五零年扩大了百分之十三。今年，国内有些地区（南乌克兰和伏尔加河流域）的气候不利于农作物的生长。尽管如此，但由于实行了党和政府所制定的提高单位面积产量和开垦生荒地和熟荒地的巨大计划，一九五四年的谷物总收获量仍将多于一九五三年。在西伯利亚西部，粮食总收获量将增为去年的两倍，其中阿尔泰边疆区几乎等于去年的四倍，哈萨克共和国将比去年增加约百分之三十五。
    农业劳动者本年度建立了光荣的功绩。他们大大超额完成了为全国人民拥护的开垦新土地的国家计划。哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索地区一九五四—一九五五年开垦生荒地和熟荒地的计划在今年就完成了百分之一百二十，开垦了将近一千七百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，在生荒地和熟荒地上播种农作物的计划完成了百分之一百五十七。
    共产党和苏联政府根据已有的经验和实际的可能性，通过了大大扩大开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作的决议，提出了一项意义重大的任务：到一九五六年，使新开垦的土地的播种面积增加到两千八百万到三千万公顷，这约等于法国和意大利全部播种面积的总和。
    进一步发展畜牧业对国家有着十分重大的意义。在过去一年中，各种产品牲畜的头数也增加了。大家知道，在一九五三年一月一日，全国的乳牛总数是两千四百三十万头，而一九五四年十月一日乳牛的总头数已增加到两千七百五十万头，即增加了三百万头以上，并且将近达到卫国战争前的乳牛总头数。过去一年中，集体农庄庄员和职工私有的牛、猪和绵羊的总头数也增加了。但是，国家的迫切利益要求所有党和苏维埃组织更加关心畜牧业的发展。
    不能容忍的是，由于去年牲畜的过冬准备工作做得不能令人满意，若干地区集体农庄牲畜的总头数不但没有增加，甚至有些减少。
    为了度过即将来到的冬季，必须建立必要的饲料储备，必须充分保养好幼畜并提高牲畜的产品生产率，以增产肉类、油脂、牛奶、羊毛和其他居民所必需的产品。
    今年开幕的苏联农业展览会鲜明地显示出了社会主义农业的伟大力量和生命力。展览会是全民的学校，它宣传了苏联农业科学的成就，宣传了集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的先进经验以及生产革新者的经验。我们还有不少落后的集体农庄，它们没有很好地和合理地利用土地，农作物的产量和牲畜的产品生产率都很低。展览会的重大意义在于：它宣传了先进农庄的先进工作方法，从而有助于在所有其他的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中推广这些方法。
    工农业发展中的成就使得劳动人民的物质福利有了进一步的提高。共产党和苏联政府认为，国内政策方面主要的任务是：最大限度地满足苏联人民不断增长的物质和文化的需要。
    在五年计划的头四年当中，苏联国民经济中的职工人数大大增加了，到一九五四年年底将增加到四千七百万人。同时职工的实际工资也将比一九四零年大约增加百分之七十四，如果将国家对居民的文化和社会福利方面的开支的增加计算在内，职工的全部收入在这个时期之内几乎增为两倍。苏联政府有计划地采取提高人民生活水平的措施，特别是在降低国家零售商品价格方面，在一九四七年到一九五四年当中，零售品价格已先后降低了七次。因而使一九五四年的零售品价格比一九四七年的要低百分之五十六点五二。
  集体农庄市场上的物价在这同一时期几乎降低了四分之三，这就大大提高了人民的购买力。因此，必须采取措施进一步扩大商品流通量并增加消费品的生产。消费品的产量的提高使为居民供应的消费品的数量大大增加了。一九五四年零售消费品的数量和一九五零年比较，增加情况如下：肉类产品和食糖约增加为一点九倍，鱼类产品和动物油约增加为一点六倍，植物油约增加为两倍，棉织品、毛织品、亚麻织品和丝织品增加了百分之六十六，家具增加为二点九倍。
    改进劳动人民的居住条件对提高劳动人民的物质福利有很大的作用。这一个五年计划规定，对住宅建设的投资额约增加为前一个五年计划的两倍。而在这四年中，住宅建设的投资额已经增为一点八倍。四年中，在各城市和乡村中的国家住宅建设方面，新建的住宅的总面积将达八千六百万平方公尺。此外，各城市和工人住宅区的居民在国家的贷款帮助下自费建造的新住宅总面积将达三千万平方公尺。但是，现已取得的这些成绩还不能满足我们日益增长的需要。共产党和苏联政府将不断地争取进一步改进劳动人民的居住条件。职工社会保险基金和居民的社会保险基金的不断增加也证明了劳动人民群众生活水平的提高。由于集体农庄公有经济的普遍发展、农产品的征购和收购价格的提高、税额的降低和过去几年的积债的取消，今年农民的实际收入增加了。
    在提高苏联劳动人民文化水平方面也做出了不少的成绩。初等和中等学校、中等技术学校以及高等学校的学生人数正在一年年地增加。今年高等学校招收的一年级新生在四十五万人以上，这是我国高等学校有史以来招收学生最多的一次。
    党和政府不倦地努力发展苏联科学，保证社会主义文化、文学和艺术的繁荣，增加我们人民的精神财富。
    列宁教导我们，共产主义是人民群众自觉的改造活动的结果。社会主义意识加速苏维埃社会的向前发展。因此，共产党十分重视对苏联人们的意识中的资产阶级思想残余和一切资本主义遗毒所进行的积极斗争。我们苏维埃文学在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育方面起着重大的作用，它的使命是要把共产主义思想灌输给群众，指示出先进的和进步的东西，抨击落后的事物，反映人民的利益、人民的英雄主义、自我牺牲精神和创造性的努力。即将举行的第二届全苏作家代表大会是我们社会生活中一个重大的事件，它将拟订出新的任务，以便更为有效地发展苏维埃文学。
    党和政府所规定的进一步发展工业、农业和提高人民物质福利和文化水平的任务是否能够胜利地完成，决定于我们的工作，决定于我们对工作的正确组织，决定于我们是否善于使用我们的全部能力和内部潜力。应当记住，任何决议无论制订得多好，要是不为实现它而进行积极的和坚持不懈的斗争，也是不能完成所规定的任务的。
    苏联人民怀着十分满意的心情欢迎党和政府关于进一步发展我国经济的措施，并以新的生产热情来回答它们。党、苏维埃和工会的组织应当领导群众的创造性并发挥他们的创造力，在工业和农业中更广泛地开展竞赛，以争取完成生产计划，争取提高劳动生产率和降低成本，争取生产高质量的产品并厉行节约。
    劳动生产率归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要和最主要的条件。列宁的这一原理是大家都知道的，乌·伊·列宁曾特别强调指出提高劳动生产率对保证我国过渡到共产主义的重大意义。
    和去年比较，一九五四年工业方面的劳动生产率约提高了百分之七；和一九五零年比较，提高了百分之三十三。但是，必须承认，这种劳动生产率的增长速度是不够的。在某些工业部门，在建筑业和农业中，大量优良的机器还没有充分利用，在广泛采用最新的科学和技术成就这方面还做得不够，在纠正劳动和生产组织中的缺点方面做得很差，先进经验推广得很慢。
    工业中的重大缺点之一是：有些企业的生产很不平衡。许多工厂工作没有节奏，在一个月中生产极不平衡。在上半月中，企业工作的水平比下半月低得多，这对于工业中劳动生产率的提高产生了不良的影响。
    党和政府认为，在工业方面最重要的任务是保证各工业企业更均衡地工作，保证每一个工厂、矿井和铁路都完成生产计划。
    我们的非生产开支仍然很多，维持管理机构的开销过于庞大，不以主人翁态度地、疏忽地对待人民财产，不善于正确地使用社会主义生产中蕴藏的潜力，这样的事实并不是少数。
    必须坚决地同工作中的缺点进行斗争，勇敢地揭露出这些缺点并努力消除它们，并善于克服任何困难。我们的力量正在于我们不怕揭露和批评自己的缺点。诚恳地承认自己的缺点和及时地根除这些缺点，将更有助于巩固我们苏维埃制度。
    进一步发展社会主义经济的任务要求我们加强劳动纪律，严格管理劳动量和消费量，坚持不懈地采用按劳取酬的原则并增加工作人员的物质利益，以提高劳动生产率和促进公有经济。
    同时，对于社会主义社会特别重要的是：正确地分配劳动力，使这些劳动力主要地集中在生产部门，即工厂、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中。目前，当苏联人民正在解决不断地提高人民消费水平的任务的时候，增加生产部门内的劳动力和减少非生产部门内的劳动力是有着非常重要的意义的。为此，我们执行了缩减国家机关和简化机构组织的方针。
    党和政府遵循着列宁的管理国家的原则，力求使我们国家机关的开支尽可能减少，使它尽可能接近群众。党和政府正在为根除我们国家机关中的文牍主义、疲沓作风和其他官僚主义的表现而斗争，为巩固机关各环节与广大劳动人民群众的联系而努力。
    苏维埃国家的奠基人列宁不止一次地指出，工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟是加强和巩固苏维埃制度的基础。列宁认为，工人阶级和农民的牢不可破的联盟是无产阶级专政的一个最高原则，这个原则是我们胜利地解决共产主义建设任务的全部力量的无尽泉源。党和政府关于进一步发展工业和农业以及提高人民福利的各项措施将使工人阶级和农民的联盟更加巩固，并提高苏维埃国家的经济和政治威力。
    十月社会主义革命的一个最大的成果是多民族的苏维埃国家的建立和巩固。十月革命解放了俄国的许多民族，使他们摆脱了民族的压迫，并为居住在我们伟大祖国的所有各民族的经济、政治和文化的高涨创造了条件。党和苏维埃国家一贯执行着列宁—斯大林的民族政策，因而使我国各民族的经济和文化获得高涨，使我国各民族团结成为一个统一的兄弟的大家庭。苏联各族人民在今年庆祝具有重要意义的历史性的日子——乌克兰与俄罗斯重新合并三百周年的时候，就特别鲜明地表明了这一点。这不仅是乌克兰和俄罗斯人民的盛大节日，而且也是在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下团结成牢不可破的友谊的苏联各民族人民的盛大节日。
    我国的内部状况比过去任何时候都稳定。全体苏联人民满怀坚定的决心为社会主义祖国的进一步繁荣而劳动。人民在党和政府的周围的团结、在精神上和政治上的牢不可破的团结一致，是使苏联沿着建设共产主义社会道路胜利前进的保证。
    我国的大规模经济和文化建设，共产党和苏联政府一贯采取的目的在于不断提高苏联人民物质福利的措施，明显地证实了苏联的爱好和平的政策。
    由于伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，人类历史上第一次诞生了这样一个国家，它的国内和外交政策完全是为人民群众的利益、和平事业和人民的安全而服务的。伟大的列宁所确定的这种政策的基本原则的基础是：只要双方有合作的愿望，愿意履行所承担的义务并遵守平等和不干涉他国内部事务的原则，社会主义制度和资本主义制度是可以和平共处的。
    过去三十七年中国际关系中的事实令人信服地说明了不同社会制度的国家完全有可能在经济、政治和文化各方面进行互利的合作。今后也完全有可能来进行这种合作以有利于巩固全世界的和平。只要这是取决于苏联的，那末可以毫无疑问地说，苏联今后仍将在承认上述关于国家之间的关系的原则的基础上，和其他国家建立关系。
    如果苏联的这种努力能得到其他国家的响应，它们也作同样的努力，那么和平事业才能取得胜利。
    为和平和国际安全而奋斗向来是苏联政府外交政策的基础。我们深信：这样的政策不仅符合苏联人民和民主阵营各国人民的利益，而且符合一切其他大、小国家的人民的利益。
    但是，要是把苏联要求和平的愿望看成是它软弱的表现，那就错了。苏维埃国家不止一次地以铁的事实证明，它能够保卫自己的利益和安全。一旦需要的时候，苏联人能够拿起武器来抵抗任何侵略者以保卫自己。那些大家都已知道的事实不必重提了，毫无疑问，这些事实不仅为我们的朋友所熟知，而且也为我们的敌人所熟知。因此，美国的一些人物想要以所谓“实力政策”来和苏联打交道，这不能不令人感到奇怪。用这种办法对待苏联从来都没有成功过。这种做法之所以愚蠢，还因为现在就连苏联的敌人也承认，苏联的力量是更加加强了，而且和苏联站在一起为和平而奋斗的还有亚洲的大国——中华人民共和国，以及一切已稳稳地走上了建设社会主义道路并和苏联一起站在和平和进步力量的最前列的并肩前进的各人民民主国家。中欧和东欧各国的人民胜利地沿着这条道路前进已有十年了。在这十年中，这些国家的面貌已焕然一新。新制度的胜利，为欧洲各人民民主国家的经济发展和文化发展创造了巨大的、空前未有的可能性。走上了建设社会主义道路的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，在他们的一切部门的创造性工作中，已取得了巨大的成就。
    这些国家在外交上的地位已经有了根本的改变，它们在国际舞台上的作用增强了。几十年来，中欧和东欧国家一直是帝国主义国家制造阴谋和进行挑衅的目标，并且常常被它们利用来当它们的侵略政策的爪牙。这种情况是一去不复返了。已经得到真正的独立的欧洲人民民主国家正在积极进行争取国际和平的斗争。
    今年十月，德国的进步力量曾隆重地庆祝德意志民主共和国——一个真正民主的、爱好和平的国家——成立五周年纪念日。
    不仅德国、而且远离德国的地方都曾庆祝这个重大的节日。这是可以理解的，因为德意志民主共和国的成立，它在经济和政治方面的成就，是德国人民建立他们的统一、独立、民主、爱好和平的国家的斗争中的一个非常重要的因素，是争取欧洲和世界和平和安全的斗争中的重要因素之一。
    中华人民共和国最近庆祝了它的建国五周年纪念日。自由独立的中华人民共和国的建立不仅是中国历史上的重大事件，同时也是全人类历史上的重大事件。这是一个具有历史意义的事实，它的意义无论给予怎样高的估计都是不会过分的。苏联人民为六亿兄弟般的中国人民的具有历史意义的成就，为他们在建立和巩固他们的国家的人民民主制度方面的成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。人民中国的伟大成就已经在全国人民代表大会会议最近通过的宪法——宣布在中国建设社会主义的原则的宪法——中以法律形式固定下来了。
    外国帝国主义者同腐朽的中国反动派相勾结压迫伟大的中国人民、使他们不能独立地参加国际问题的解决的时代已经一去不复返了。不管国际反动派——首先是美国侵略集团——怎样反对，中华人民共和国已经以真正的大国和强有力的和平因素的身分肯定地出现在国际舞台了。
    牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的合作，使各人民民主国家和苏联联结在一起。对于朝着伟大的十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路前进的各国人民来说，苏联的社会主义建设是极其丰富的经验的源泉。
    强大的民主和社会主义阵营已把九亿人民团结在自己的旗帜之下，它的坚持不渝地争取和平的斗争，获得了资本主义国家各阶层人民越来越广泛的同情和积极的支持。这就是现代最伟大的历史性转变的直接表现——各国人民愈来愈把和平事业掌握在他们自己的手中。
    以苏联为首的和平力量的一贯的、目的鲜明的斗争，近来已产生了一些积极的结果。在朝鲜已清算了一个危险的战争发源地。日内瓦会议的成就已使印度支那的敌对行动终止，这就使得印度支那问题有可能在充分考虑到印度支那各国人民的正当的民族利益的情况下获得最后的解决。日内瓦会议的成就已明白地显示了东方各国人民的民族解放运动是不可战胜的，显示了和平阵营的日益增长的力量以及通过外交谈判来解决悬而未决的国际问题的方法是有效的。
    近来苏联同其他国家的经济和文化关系已经有了相当大的发展，并且继续在发展，这无疑有助于整个国际局势的正常化。最近我国同南斯拉夫的关系已经有了改善。某些阻挠苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系正常化的障碍已经消除，并且已经采取步骤来恢复贸易和建立文化方面以及其他方面的联系。南斯拉夫政府已经表示愿意在改善同苏联的关系方面实行合作。至于苏联政府，它认为利用一切机会来建立正常和友好的关系是符合于两国人民的利益的。最近几年来出现于我们两国之间的不和和敌视只是有利于苏联和南斯拉夫的敌人，有利于和平的敌人。相反地，苏联和南斯拉夫两国人民之间的合作和真诚的友谊不但完全符合于我们两国的利益，并且也符合于世界和平的需要。苏联政府方面将继续用一切方法促进苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系的完全正常化，促进我国人民和兄弟般的南斯拉夫人民之间的悠久友谊的巩固，并且希望在这样做的过程中能得到南斯拉夫方面的充分谅解。
    各国广大公众愈来愈了解和支持苏联政府关于有可能和必要通过有关国家的协议来解决国际争端以加强和平和保证各国的自由发展的著名论点。
    全世界人民对于在缓和国际紧张局势方面获得的成就感到极其满意，这种成就已使他们对自己的力量和防止另一次战争和维护和平事业的能力产生了更大的信心。
    苏联人民深信进一步缓和国际紧张局势的可能性并没有利用净尽，在这方面还只是采取了初步的步骤。同时，我们也清楚地认识到在这个前途中某些国家的侵略分子还布下了严重的障碍。这些分子时时刻刻进行新的阴谋活动，以阻止国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，继续拼凑针对着苏联和各人民民主国家的军事集团。这种集团正在欧洲、亚洲和世界上其他地区建立起来，并且在建立这些集团的同时，美国总是要在离它的边界千万公里以外的其他国家的领土上建立新基地。
    由于加强和平、裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器已成为最重要和最迫切的问题之一，因此，这些问题的解决能够大大减少军事开支和赋税负担
  （这种负担现在已完全落到劳动人民身上）。这无疑还将使整个国际局势得到很大的改善。
    原子能的发现和使用是人类天才的一个伟大成就，它打开了进一步发展社会生产力的广阔前景。然而，大家知道，某些国家的有势力的集团竭力想使原子能为战争计划服务。各国人民的切身利益要求严格禁止把原子能用于毁灭和大规模屠杀人类，要求把这种强有力的自然力量完全用于建设性的目的，用来促进人类的进步。
    大家知道，苏联科学在将原子能用于和平目的方面已取得了卓越的成就，苏联的原子能发电站已开始发电了。
    苏联毫不松懈地在争取禁止原子武器。和苏联的这种立场直接相联的是，苏联代表团已将一个关于禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器并从各国军备中取消这些武器，关于大量裁减军备并为实现这些决议而建立国际监督的国际公约基本条款草案提交联合国大会讨论。苏联的建议规定了
  一些解决这些问题的具体的和实际的措施。
    我们可以很满意地指出，苏联的新建议已得到全世界最广泛的舆论的拥护。但同时不能不承认，目前只发表一些论苏联政府最近建议的重要性的声明还是不够的。必须更加坚决和积极地进行斗争，反对在解决这些问题中制造新僵局和人为地阻碍达成协议的企图，反对打算无视在就这些重要问题所进行的谈判中各国的意见正趋于接近的企图。
    一方面想认真地进行裁减军备的谈判，而同时却在为西德复仇势力打开大门以复活德国军国主义，这也是不成的。欧洲人民对希特勒分子血腥统治的日子还记忆犹新。
    从最近事实发展的情况看来，复活西德军国主义的拥护者所玩弄的花样除了会引起广大舆论的激愤外，再不会产生别的后果。在这方面，不能忽视西方国家在伦敦和巴黎的片面会议上所通过的关于德国问题的决议。
    美、英、法三国政府违背和苏联共同担负的防止德国军国主义复活的义务，并漠视各国人民对和平的愿望，而同西德军国主义者和复仇主义者缔结了恢复西德国防军的片面协定。使西德重新军国主义化的巴黎协定规定在第一阶段建立五十万西德军队。然而即使在现在，波恩政府已毫不掩饰它将建立数量比巴黎协定所规定的多得多的军团和师的计划。
    西德的工业——其中包括曾是希特勒德国的兵工厂的鲁尔军事工业——已经经过重新调整而为西德的重新武装服务。在西德到处都有大量的军国主义和法西斯的书籍，这决不是偶然的，这些书籍公开主张对德国的欧洲邻国发动另一次战争。就是这些昨日还是希特勒发动对法国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的侵略战争的组织者，现在在西德掌握着越来越大的权力。
    因此，伦敦和巴黎两协定会使西德变成一个军国主义国家。也不应该忽视这样一个事实：根据巴黎协定，西德军队能够拥有原子武器。除此以外，协定还直接规定，在西德将展开原子研究方面的工作。
    西欧资本主义国家的政府显然忘记了：武装西德会使欧洲人民以至于全人类受到极大的威胁，因为具有军国主义思想的西德统治者不久以后除了将拥有其他种类的武器以外，还将拥有原子武器，毫无疑问，他们是想要利用这种武器来达到他们的复仇和侵略的目的的。
    西欧的一些眼光短浅的政界人物正在宣传一种错误的论调，说批准伦敦和巴黎协定将会增加四国就德国问题达成协议的机会。只有没有头脑的人才会相信这种说法。实际上，批准和实施巴黎和伦敦两个协定将为达成关于德国问题的协议造成新的障碍，将会加深德国目前的分裂，将使德意志民族处于被肢解的状态。
    为了欧洲和平的利益和德国人民本身的利益，必须立即在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，必须建立起欧洲集体安全体系。为了这种利益，还必须做到不组织有重新军国主义化的西德参加的排他性的军事集团，而是在欧洲建立起集体安全体系。在欧洲各国共同努力的基础上建立起来的这种安全体系是符合于世界各国人民的切身利益的，因为维护欧洲和平对保卫世界和平有决定性的作用。
    苏联人民坚信，只有这样一种清醒地估计到世界上所发生的具有历史意义的变化的解决国际问题的办法，才能通过现实生活的考验。我们认为，我们应该坚持为不同社会制度的国家所能接受并对它们有利的原则，来解决欧洲和亚洲的一些悬而未决的国际问题。
    同志们！伟大的十月社会主义革命距离我们的时期越久，它对整个人类历史命运所起的巨大的改变影响越是更充分和更全面地显示出来。
    苏维埃国家光荣的三十七年历史，以无敌的力量证明了社会主义对资本主义的无比优越性；这三十七年历史是百战百胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的真正胜利。
    我们的道路是正确的。世界上没有一种力量能够阻止我们坚持在正确的道路上前进。兄弟般的中国人民、欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家的千百万人民，同我们一起沿着伟大的十月革命所指出的道路前进。全体进步人类热烈地同情我们争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的共同事业。
    苏联人民理所当然地为他们的伟大的历史使命感到自豪，并且充满决心要克服他们道路上的一切阻碍，争取在建设共产主义中获得更多的成就。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利的旗帜万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民——全体进步人类的战斗先锋队万岁！
    充满信心地把我们国家引向共产主义的苏联共产党万岁！
    国际和平万岁！
