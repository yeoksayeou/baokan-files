    The students of the Hubei Province Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School and its four branches, during this year's flood control struggle in Wuhan, displayed the revolutionary soldiers' perseverance, bravery, and tenacious fighting spirit, and successfully completed the glorious tasks assigned to them by the flood control headquarters.
    When the flood began to rise, severely threatening the lives and property of Wuhan's 1.5 million citizens and the socialist construction of the Wuhan area, the students of the Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School actively responded to the Party's call to "Conquer the flood and ensure safety," and submitted applications to the school leaders, resolutely requesting to participate in the flood control struggle. In the end, a total of 573 people were approved to participate in the flood control commando team. Seriously disabled comrades who had difficulty walking, after repeated persuasion, stayed in the school to support the flood control front line and the security work of the school.
    After this flood control team arrived at the flood control front line, they immediately plunged into intense work. In the work of carrying soil, digging soil, and loading soil, they overcame the difficulties of their physical disabilities, contributed all their strength, and made great achievements. The Fourth Branch alone completed 154 work shifts, totaling 11,649 workdays, completing more than 27,800 cubic meters of earthwork and 776 tons of stonework. The students who participated in the embankment repair project in the Kuaizi Street area of Wuhan City completed 3,000 cubic meters of earthwork in three days. When the Second Branch was engaged in flood control at the Hanyang Railroad Tie Anti-Corrosion Factory, they accepted a reinforcement project of 60 meters long, 30 meters wide, and 70 centimeters high, and completed the task in less than six hours, ensuring the safety of the factory.
    During the flood control struggle, many moving deeds emerged among the revolutionary disabled veterans. Qiu Pengcheng, a third-class disabled veteran who was awarded a first-class merit and was deaf in both ears, worked actively and diligently after joining the flood control battle, and had fainted on the construction site several times. He set new records twice in carrying soil. Once, over a distance of two kilometers, he carried 20 loads of soil (each load weighing more than 50 kilograms) in six hours, traveling a total of 40 kilometers round trip, breaking the highest record for carrying soil on this rugged road by all flood control personnel. Chen Wenping, who lost his right arm, could not carry soil alone, so he carried it with others and rarely rested. Wang Wenyuan's hands developed two large blisters, and he replied to the comrades who asked him to rest with a jingle: "Cannot, cannot, absolutely cannot, the flood is merciless, to overcome the merciless water, fatigue and sweat are minor matters." Even more admirable was Cong Zhiqing, a first-class revolutionary disabled veteran who was awarded a first-class merit. In order to participate in the rescue team, he repeatedly requested his superiors several times a day; the leaders took care of his health and did not agree to let him go, because he had two prosthetic legs, and it was already very difficult to walk normally, let alone dig and carry soil on the muddy construction site. The leaders comforted him, and the comrades dissuaded him, but they could not change his enthusiasm and will to participate in flood control work. On July 19, Cong Zhiqing finally participated in the flood control work. He braved the heavy rain, stepped on the mud, and dug the soil one hoe at a time. Blisters appeared on his hands, but he still composed and sang clappers to encourage everyone. Under his encouragement, people's confidence in overcoming the flood was further enhanced.
    In the flood control work, the revolutionary disabled veterans also actively looked for tricks and thought of ways to continuously improve work efficiency. The students of the First Branch created a new method when loading sacks, which increased work efficiency eight times. The students of the Second Branch created the "sliding board soil pushing method," which could save twenty man-hours per boatload of soil unloaded. Some adjusted the labor organization; originally, it took five people eight minutes to load a truck of soil, but later it only took more than two minutes; unloading a truck of soil by three people was also reduced from eight minutes to about three minutes. This ensured the need for soil at the construction site, and the students also had more adequate rest time.
    While fighting the flood, they organized a harvesting team to support the farmers participating in flood control work. In the hot sun, in rice fields with water up to their waists, they helped the farmers to harvest the rice on time, which was welcomed by the masses of farmers. In Dahe Village, there was an old woman named Granny He whose two sons were on the flood control front line. Her rice was ripe but no one was harvesting it, and she was very anxious. After the harvesting team learned about it, they helped her harvest the rice in two days.
    At the same time, a Lei Feng-style martyr, Yan Zhongliang, emerged in the harvesting team. One day, his harvesting team helped farmer Peng Huabin harvest his rice, loaded the rice onto a small wooden boat, and transported it home. On the way, they suddenly found that the wooden boat was taking on water, and the hull quickly sank more than 30 centimeters. The situation was very critical. The team leader immediately issued an order saying, "Those who can swim, quickly get into the water to reduce the weight of the boat." Yan Zhongliang immediately said, "I can swim." He jumped into the water without even taking off his clothes. Then another comrade, Tang Qinghai, also jumped in. Tang Qinghai found that Yan Zhongliang was flustered in the water and was about to sink, so he called for help from the boat and swam towards Yan Zhongliang to rescue him. Because Tang Qinghai was physically weak and had poor swimming skills, both of them sank into the water together. Tang Qinghai drank a lot of water and was somewhat unconscious. At this critical moment, he felt Yan Zhongliang pushing him up from below… At this time, workers from a construction site released a wooden raft and rescued Tang Qinghai. But Yan Zhongliang never surfaced again. In this way, Yan Zhongliang sacrificed his precious life for the safety of the comrades on the boat and to prevent the loss of the farmers' rice, and to rescue his comrades. This noble quality of revolutionary humanitarianism moved the surrounding masses. Many people shed tears of gratitude and expressed their determination to take practical action to defeat the flood as a memorial to him. The Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters posthumously recognized Comrade Yan Zhongliang as a first-class hero; the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to his wishes before his death, posthumously recognized him as a full member of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The students of the Hubei Province Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School, in the intense flood control struggle, due to their selfless labor, successfully completed their tasks and won new honors. In addition to being commended by the Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters, they also won five unit award flags, including two first-class red flag awards; 45 of them were awarded merits. On the flood control front, they maintained and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Army.

    湖北省革命残废军人学校的学员们获得了新的荣誉
    苏明
    湖北省革命残废军人学校和所属四个分部的全体学员，在今年武汉市的防汛斗争中，发扬革命军人的坚毅、勇敢、顽强的战斗精神，出色地完成了防汛指挥部交给他们的光荣任务。
    当洪水开始上涨、严重地威胁着武汉市一百五十万市民的生命财产和武汉地区社会主义建设的时候，革命残废军人学校的学员积极地响应了党发出的“战胜洪水、确保安全”的号召，纷纷向学校领导递送申请书，坚决要求参加防汛斗争。最后批准参加防汛突击队的共有五百七十三人。行走不便的重残废同志，经过再三说服，留在学校里做支援防汛前线的工作和学校的保卫工作。
    这支防汛大队到达防汛前线以后，立即投入紧张的工作。在挑土、挖土、装土等工作中，他们克服了身体残废的困难，贡献了一切力量，作出了很大的成绩。只第四分部一个单位，就出勤一百五十四次，合一万一千六百四十九个工，完成了二万七千八百多土方工程和七百七十六吨石方工程。参加武汉市筷子街一带培修堤防工程的学员们，用三天的时间完成了三千土方工程。第二分部在汉阳枕木防腐工厂防汛时，接受了六十公尺长、三十公尺宽、七十公分高的加固工程，不到六个钟头就完成任务，确保了工厂的安全。
    在防汛斗争中，革命残废军人中间出现了许多动人的事迹。荣立一等功、双耳失聋的三等甲级革命残废军人邱鹏程，投入防汛战斗以后，一直积极苦干，曾经几次昏倒在工地上。他在挑土工作中两次创造了新纪录。有一次是在两里路的距离内，他用六个钟头挑土二十担（每担一百多斤重），往返共八十里路，打破了在这段崎岖不平的路上所有防汛人员挑土的最高纪录。失掉右臂的陈文平，不能单独挑土，就和别人抬，很少休息。望文元的手，磨起两个大血泡，还用顺口溜答复要他休息的同志们：“不能、不能、万不能，洪水冲来不容情，为了战胜无情水，劳累流汗是小事情。”更使人敬佩的是荣立一等功的一等革命残废军人从志清。为了参加抢险队，他曾一天几次向上级请求；领导上照顾他的身体，不同意他去，因为他是两只假腿，平时走路已经很困难，在泥泞的工地上挖土、挑土，更是不堪设想。领导同志安慰他，同志们劝阻他，都不能改变他参加防汛工作的热情和意志。七月十九日，从志清终于参加了防汛工作。他冒着大雨，踩着泥浆，一镢头一镢头地挖土，手上磨起了泡，但还编唱快板鼓动大家。在他的激励下，人们更加提高了战胜洪水的信心。
    革命残废军人们在防汛工作中还积极地找窍门、想办法，使工作效率不断提高。第一分部的学员们在装麻袋时，创造了新的办法，提高工作效率八倍。第二分部的学员们创造了“滑板推土法”，卸一船土可以节省二十个人工。有的调整了劳动组织，原来五个人装一车土要八分钟，后来只要两分多钟；三人卸一车土也由八分钟减少到三分钟左右。这样就保证了工地泥土的需要，学员们也有了比较充分的休息时间。
    在和洪水斗争的同时，他们组织了抢收队，支援参加防汛工作的农民。在炎热的阳光下，在水深齐腰的稻田里，他们帮助农民按时把稻谷收割完毕，受到农民群众的欢迎。当地大河村有位何婆婆，两个儿子都在防汛前线上，她家的稻子熟了没人收割，心里很焦急；抢收队知道以后，两天之内就帮助她把稻子割完了。
    同时抢收队里出现了罗盛教式的烈士严中良。一天，他那个收割小组帮助农民彭华斌家割完稻子，把稻谷装上小木船运回家去，走在中途，突然发现木船进了水，船身很快下沉一尺多。当时情况十分危急。组长立即发出命令说：“会游水的赶快下水，好减轻船的重量。”严中良马上说：“我会游水。”衣服也顾不得脱就跳下水去。接着另一同志唐清海也跳了下去。唐清海发现严中良在水中手脚忙乱，将要下沉，便一面向船上呼救，一面向严中良泅去抢救。唐清海因为体力不支，水性也差，两人一齐沉入水中。唐清海喝了很多水，有些昏迷，在这紧急关头，他觉得严中良在下面用力把他往上托了一把……。这时某建筑工地的工人放来一付木排，把唐清海救了起来。可是严中良却再也没有浮出水面。就这样，严中良为了船上的同志的安全和农民的稻谷不受损失，为了抢救他的战友，他献出了自己宝贵的生命。这种革命的人道主义的高贵品质，感动了周围的群众。很多人淌下了感激的眼泪，纷纷表示决心用打退洪水的实际行动，作为对他的纪念。武汉市防汛总指挥部追认严中良同志为一等功臣；中共湖北省委员会根据他生前的要求，追认他为中国共产党正式党员。
    湖北省革命残废军人学校的学员们在紧张的防汛斗争中，由于忘我的劳动，出色地完成了任务，获得了新的荣誉。他们除受到武汉市防汛总指挥部的通报表扬之外，还获得单位奖旗五面，内有一等红旗奖两面；他们之中有四十五人立了功，在防汛战线上，他们保持并发扬了人民军队的优良传统。
