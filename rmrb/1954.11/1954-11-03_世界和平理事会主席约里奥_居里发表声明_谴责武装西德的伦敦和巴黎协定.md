    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 2nd. World Peace Council President Frédéric Joliot-Curie issued a statement on October 30 regarding the London and Paris agreements on arming West Germany, stating: The London and Paris agreements seriously threaten peace, and citizens of directly concerned countries should take immediate action, because the governments concluding these agreements intend to approve these agreements at the fastest possible speed before public opinion has fully recognized their dangers.

    Joliot-Curie then pointed out: If national parliaments approve the London and Paris agreements, it is equivalent to supporting the policy of "armed peace" and establishing hostile military blocs, that is, it is equivalent to supporting a policy that can only exacerbate international tensions and increase the risk of new wars.

    The statement pointed out that those who signed the London and Paris agreements were attempting to exacerbate international tensions at a time when they had already greatly eased, and refuted the claim by the governments that signed the agreements that arming West Germany was inevitable. The statement said: The truth is that certain countries want to establish an armed bloc in which the West German leaders, who have never concealed their territorial ambitions, will also participate.

    Joliot-Curie also exposed another "reason" for defending militarization by the Bonn revanchists, namely the so-called "reconciliation" with Germany. Joliot-Curie said: Once the London and Paris agreements are approved, they will be used by those who once supported Hitler's rule, those who should be held responsible for Hitler's rule, and those who have never concealed their desire to launch new crusades in Europe as tools for launching new wars. History has proven that the obligations stipulated in the agreements that prohibit the use of armed forces cannot restrain the actions of these people.

    Joliot-Curie concluded: Now there are all the conditions to accomplish the following tasks: to solve the issue of German unification through peaceful and democratic methods; to establish a collective security system in which all European countries with different economic and social systems can participate; to achieve universal disarmament; to save mankind from the terrible threat of using weapons of mass destruction, and to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes to greatly improve the living conditions of the people.

    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里发表声明
    谴责武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：世界和平理事会主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里十月三十日就武装西德的伦敦协定和巴黎协定发表声明说：伦敦协定和巴黎协定严重地威胁着和平，直接有关国家的公民应该立即行动起来，因为缔结这些协定的政府打算以最大速度在舆论还没有充分认识这些协定的危险性以前，批准这些协定。
    约里奥—居里接着指出：各国议会如果批准伦敦协定和巴黎协定，就等于支持“武装的和平”、建立敌对军事集团的政策，也就是说，等于支持那种只能是加剧国际紧张局势和增加新战争危险的政策。
    声明指出签订伦敦和巴黎协定的人企图在国际紧张局势已大大缓和的时候加剧国际紧张局势，并且驳斥了签订协定的各国政府关于武装西德是不可避免的说法。声明说：真实情况是某些国家要建立一个武装集团，在这个集团中，从来不掩饰自己的领土野心的西德领导人也将参加进去。
    约里奥—居里还揭露了波恩复仇主义者另外一种为军国主义化而辩护的“理由”，这就是所谓和德国“和解”的说法。约里奥—居里说：伦敦和巴黎协定一旦批准，就会被那些过去拥护希特勒统治的人们，那些对希特勒统治应该负责的人们，那些从来不掩饰他们想在欧洲发动新的十字军远征的人们用来作为发动新战争的工具。历史证明：协定所规定的那些不准使用武装力量的义务是约束不了这些人的行动的。
    约里奥—居里最后说：现在有着一切条件完成下列工作：用和平民主的方法解决统一德国的问题；建立经济社会制度不同的欧洲所有国家都能参加的集体安全体系；普遍裁军；使人类免受使用大规模毁灭性武器的可怕的威胁，将原子能用于和平目的，以大大改善人民的生活条件。
