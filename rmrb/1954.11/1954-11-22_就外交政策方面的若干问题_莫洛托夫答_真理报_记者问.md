Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 20th: TASS Moscow, November 20th: The following are the answers given by Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov to several questions on foreign policy issues raised by a "Pravda" reporter:

    Question: What is your opinion of the comments made by foreign newspapers on the Soviet government's note of November 13 regarding the convening of an all-European conference to discuss European collective security issues?

    Answer: As everyone knows, some European countries have already expressed a positive attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal, jointly put forward with the Polish and Czechoslovak governments, to convene an all-European conference to discuss European collective security issues. Other European countries have not yet expressed their attitude towards the proposal to convene this conference.

    As for the attitude of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, they have not yet responded to the Soviet note. However, judging from the statements of officials, the governments of the aforementioned countries have adopted a negative attitude towards this proposal. One gets the impression that the governments of these countries are not only preparing to oppose this proposal, but are also using all means to obstruct the convening of an all-European conference. To this end, strong pressure is being applied to other European countries, their parliaments, political parties, and social figures.

    Judging from the comments published in the newspapers, broad sections of the public in Europe—and not only in Europe—have understood the significance of convening an all-European conference.

    This proposal, regarding the maintenance and strengthening of peace in Europe, aims to prevent certain European countries from opposing other European countries. An all-European conference, where each government can express its opinion and make suggestions on European collective security issues, will not be harmful to any peace-loving country; it can and will certainly promote the consolidation of peace and the easing of international tensions.

    On the other hand, rejecting such an all-European conference can only harm the interests of peace in Europe.

    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France are trying every possible means to prevent the convening of an all-European conference to discuss European collective security. They are trying to get the Paris Agreements ratified as soon as possible, and are unwilling to make efforts to convene such a conference. In this way, they hope to accelerate the remilitarization of West Germany and include it in military blocs such as the "Western European Union" and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    The statements they make insist that the plan to build a 500,000-strong West German army and to drag remilitarized West Germany into military blocs may promote peace in Europe.

    Is it any wonder that no one believes their statements? The vast majority of people have already realized that this is a path leading to the preparation of a new war in Europe, rather than a path leading to the maintenance and consolidation of peace.

    Therefore, if the Paris Agreements on the remilitarization of West Germany are ratified and implemented, and if Germany is dragged into the aforementioned military blocs of Western countries, a new situation will arise in Europe that will aggravate the danger of war. In this case, peace-loving European countries will have to consider new measures to ensure their security. The entire responsibility for intensifying the arms race and increasing the military spending burden on the people of European countries will fall on those who today reject the organization of European collective security and force the people of Western Europe to accept the revival of German militarism, which is plotting a new war for revenge.

    As for the Soviet Union, it believes it is necessary to warn that the Paris Agreements are preparing for a new war in Europe. The organization of European collective security is the only solution that meets the interests of strengthening peace.

    Question: Does the Soviet government believe that it is possible to reach an agreement with other countries on the German question?

    Answer: Yes, it believes this is possible. If all the countries concerned believe that the main urgent task is to restore the unity of Germany, rather than remilitarizing one part or another of Germany, then an agreement can undoubtedly be reached. Needless to say, a unified Germany must never be a militarist country. Germany must be unified into a peace-loving and democratic country. In this case, Germany will participate in the equal family of European nations and will play an important role in organizing European collective security.

    The question today is: Will West Germany become a militarist country as stipulated in the Paris Agreements, or will West Germany, and the whole of Germany, move forward along the path of peace?

    The remilitarization of West Germany would block the road to Germany's restoration of national unity. In contrast, rejecting West German militarization would pave the way for reaching an agreement on the issue of unifying Germany into a single country. If this is the case, there is hope of reaching an agreement on the issue of holding free all-German elections by secret ballot and guaranteeing the democratic rights of the German people.

    At the same time, the Soviet government, as always, believes that the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces from East and West Germany, as the Soviet government has suggested, would greatly help the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany and would help complete the task of restoring German unity.

    Question: Some say that the ratification of the Paris Agreements will not prevent Western countries from negotiating with the Soviet Union on outstanding European issues in the future. What is your opinion on this statement?

    Answer: This statement is an attempt to mislead public opinion. People cannot fail to see that the ratification of the Paris Agreements would seriously complicate the situation in Europe and would undermine the existing possibilities for resolving outstanding European issues, first and foremost the German question.

    The remilitarization of West Germany is incompatible with the restoration of Germany's unity along a peaceful and democratic path.

    Unless the United States, Britain, and France abandon their policy of remilitarizing West Germany and dragging it into military blocs, and turn to the path of ensuring Germany's peaceful development as stipulated in the relevant international agreements, it is meaningless to hold talks on the issue of restoring German unity. This shows how much value there is in the statement that the ratification of the Paris Agreements "will not prevent" Western countries and the Soviet Union from holding talks on outstanding European issues.

    Question: Western newspapers have made statements saying that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference on November 29 sets a time limit within which there is not enough time to prepare for the conference. What is your opinion on these statements?

    Answer: The Soviet government proposed convening an all-European conference on November 29 because it saw that the debate on ratifying the Paris Agreements would be held in December.

    At the same time, it must be recalled that the Soviet government already put forward a draft "All-European Treaty on Ensuring European Collective Security" at the Berlin Conference, and this draft was published nine months ago. As everyone knows, the Soviet government made a proposal four months ago—on July 24—to hold an all-European conference to discuss European collective security issues. The Soviet government only determined the date for convening the conference in its recent note.

    Of course, it is possible to reach an agreement on another date for convening the all-European conference if the debate on ratifying the Paris Agreements is postponed.

    就外交政策方面的若干问题
    莫洛托夫答“真理报”记者问
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：以下是苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫对“真理报”记者所提一些关于外交政策方面的问题的答复：
    问：你对外国报纸就苏联政府十一月十三日关于召开讨论欧洲集体安全问题的全欧会议的照会所发表的评论怎样看法？
    答：大家知道，一些欧洲国家已经对苏联政府同波兰政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府共同提出的召开讨论欧洲集体安全问题的全欧会议的建议表示积极的态度。其他欧洲国家还没有对关于召开这个会议的建议表示态度。
    至于美、英、法三国政府的态度，它们到现在还没有对苏联的照会提出答复。但是从官员们的言论看来，上述国家的政府对这个建议采取了消极的态度。人们得到这样一种印象：这些国家的政府不但正在准备反对这个建议，而且正在利用一切办法阻挠全欧会议的召开。为了这个目的，正在对其他欧洲国家、它们的议会、政党和社会人物施用强大的压力。
    从报纸上发表的评论看来，欧洲——而且不仅是欧洲——的广大阶层的公众已经了解召开全欧会议的意义。
    这个建议在有关维持和加强欧洲和平的问题上，目的在于防止某些欧洲国家反对其他一些欧洲国家。每一国政府可以就欧洲集体安全问题表示意见和提出建议的这样一个全欧会议，对任何爱好和平的国家是不会有什么害处的，它能够而且一定会促进和平的巩固和国际紧张局势的缓和。
    在另一方面，拒绝这样一个全欧会议，只能损害欧洲和平的利益。
    美、英、法三国政府正在想尽办法防止召开讨论欧洲集体安全的全欧会议，力图使巴黎协定尽早获得批准而不愿为召开这样一个会议努力。这样，他们希望加速西德的重新军国主义化并把它包括在像“西欧联盟”和北大西洋集团那样的军事集团中去。
    他们发表的言论硬说建立一支五十万人的西德军队和把重新军国主义化的西德拉进军事集团去的计划可能促进欧洲的和平。
  谁也不相信他们这种说法，这有什么奇怪呢？绝大多数人民已经认识到：这是导向在欧洲准备一个新战争的道路，而不是导向维持和巩固和平的道路。
    因此，如果关于西德重新军国主义化的巴黎协定获得批准并付诸实施，如果德国被拉入了上述西方国家军事集团的话，欧洲将产生一种使战争危险加剧的新局面。在这种情况下，爱好和平的欧洲国家将不得不考虑新措施以保障它们的安全。加紧军备竞赛以及增加欧洲各国人民的军费负担的全部责任，将落在那些今天拒绝欧洲集体安全组织，并强使西欧各国人民接受正在策划新战争以进行报复的德国军国主义的复活的人的身上。
    至于苏联，它认为有必要发出警告：巴黎协定是为欧洲新战争进行准备工作。欧洲集体安全组织是唯一符合加强和平的利益的办法。
    问：苏联政府是否认为同其他国家就德国问题达成协议是可能的？
    答：是的，它认为这是可能的。如果所有有关国家都认为主要的紧急任务是恢复德国的统一，而不是使德国这一部分或那一部分重新军国主义化，那末协议无疑是可以达成的。不用说，一个统一了的德国决不能是一个军国主义国家，德国必须统一成为一个爱好和平的和民主的国家。在这种情况下，德国将参加欧洲各国人民的平等的大家庭，并将在组织欧洲的集体安全方面担当重要的作用。
    今天的问题是：西德将像巴黎协定所规定的那样成为一个军国主义国家呢，还是西德，以及整个德国，将沿着和平的道路向前发展呢？
    西德的重新军国主义化会堵死德国恢复全国统一的道路。与此相反，拒绝西德军国主义化会铺平在把德国统一成为一个统一的国家问题上取得协议的道路。如果是这样情况，就有希望就举行以秘密投票方式进行的全德自由选举问题和保证全德人民的民主权利问题取得协议。
    同时，苏联政府像以往任何时候一样，认为：像苏联政府曾建议的那样立即从东西德撤退占领军，会大大有助于德国两部分的接近并会有助于完成恢复德国统一的任务。
    问：有人说，批准巴黎协定不会妨碍西方国家同苏联将来就欧洲悬而未决问题进行谈判，你对这种说法怎样看法？
    答：这种说法是企图迷惑舆论。人们不会不看到：批准巴黎协定会严重地使欧洲局势复杂起来，并会破坏现在有的解决欧洲悬而未决问题、首先是德国问题的可能性。
    西德的重新军国主义化同德国沿着和平和民主的道路恢复统一是不相容的。
    除非美国、英国和法国放弃它们的使西德重新军国主义化和把它拉入军事集团的政策，并转到像有关的国际协定所规定的那样保证德国和平发展的道路上来，否则举行德国恢复统一问题的会谈是没有意义的。这就说明了硬说批准巴黎协定“将不会妨碍”西方国家和苏联就欧洲悬而未决问题举行会谈的话有多大价值。
    问：西方国家报纸上发表言论，说是苏联提出的在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议的建议规定了一个时限，在这个时限内准备会议是来不及的，你对这些言论怎样看法？
    答：苏联政府建议在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议，是因为看到批准巴黎协定的辩论将在十二月间举行的缘故。
    同时，必须追溯一下，苏联政府已经在柏林会议上提出了关于“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，这个草案在九个月前就已经公布了。大家知道，苏联政府在四个月前——七月二十四日——就提出了举行全欧会议以讨论欧洲集体安全问题的建议。苏联政府在最近的照会中只是确定了召开会议的日期。
    当然，就召开全欧会议的另外的日期达成协议是可能的，如果批准巴黎协定的辩论延期的话。
