State-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory Workers
    Conserve a Great Deal of Metal Materials
    Workers at the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory have come up with many ways to conserve metal materials. In the most recent seven months, the recycling of molten iron filings alone has saved the state 556 tons of pig iron. In addition, much copper filings were smelted into copper ingots. Using the copper scraps from cutting, they are able to supply enough material to manufacture more than twenty additional water tanks for twisting machines, and can also manufacture more than a dozen copper rollers for twisting machines. Furthermore, the workers researched the use of galvanized iron sheets to replace copper materials in the manufacture of leaf springs for twisting machines, and the use of domestically produced high-speed steel blades to replace imported white steel blades. As a result of the large-scale conservation of raw materials and the improvement of product quality, the cost of the factory's main product, the twisting machine, has recently been reduced by about 30% compared to the state plan.

    国营天津纺织机械厂职工
    节约许多金属材料
    国营天津纺织机械厂的职工想出许多办法节约金属材料。在最近七个月中，仅熔炼铁末回收一项，就为国家节约了五百五十六吨生铁，另外把许多铜末熔炼成铜锭。利用剪裁下来的铜边料，能够供给多制造二十多台合股机的水槽使用，还能多制造十几台合股机的铜罗拉。此外，职工们研究出用铁皮镀锌代替铜料制造合股机的叶子板，用国产的锋钢刀代替进口的白钢刀。由于原材料的大量节约和提高产品质量的结果，这个工厂的主要产品合股机的成本最近已比国家计划降低了百分之三十左右。（新华社）
