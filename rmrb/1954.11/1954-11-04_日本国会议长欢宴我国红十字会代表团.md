Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd — The Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan attended a welcome banquet hosted by T堤康次郎, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, and 河井弥八, Speaker of the House of Councillors, at 5 p.m. on the 2nd.

Those attending the banquet included: Japanese Minister of State 正纯安藤, 春江山下, Chairman of the Special Committee for Investigation and Assistance for Repatriation of Overseas Compatriots of the House of Representatives, 均芦田 and 渡楢桥 from the Reform Party, and 一郎矢野, President of the Japan Life Insurance Association, among others.

康次郎堤 delivered the first speech. He expressed his gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross for its efforts in assisting the repatriation of Japanese nationals. He said: There are no normal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Japan at present. However, despite this, a large number of Japanese nationals have been able to return home in a short period of time, which is a manifestation of the spirit of humanitarianism.

李德全, the head of the delegation, said in her speech: The Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan are envoys of the people, and we would like to take this opportunity to express the views of our people. Our people unanimously believe that restoring normal relations between China and Japan, carrying out economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan, enhancing friendship between the two countries, and promoting peaceful coexistence between the two countries are the common aspirations of the people of China and Japan, and are also in line with the interests of peace in Asia and the world. She said: We deeply believe that our common aspirations mentioned above will be realized through the joint efforts of all of you and us.

春江山下 delivered a welcoming speech. She said: China and Japan have a profound relationship in history. The two countries should maintain friendly relations. The smooth resolution of the repatriation of Japanese nationals in China and Japanese war criminals will promote friendly relations between the two countries.

弥八河井 said in his speech: From Japan's point of view, it is necessary to establish peaceful relations between China and Japan as soon as possible, deepen the friendship between the people, and carry out cultural exchanges so that Japan can achieve peace and prosperity. This visit to Japan by the Chinese Red Cross delegation provides a good opportunity for friendly exchanges between China and Japan.

廖承志, the deputy head of the delegation, said: For the sake of peace in Asia, peaceful relations between China and Japan must be established first. This is our country's long-term and fundamental national policy. The question now is how to create opportunities for mutual exchange and understanding, and there are no problems that cannot be solved through friendly exchanges and consultations. We hope to strengthen exchanges between China and Japan.

After the banquet, 正纯安藤 also held a discussion with members of the delegation.
