No Looking Back
Xiang Qian

On March 29th of this year, the second page of the *Shenyang Daily* published an article entitled "Light Industrial Products Must Adapt to National and Civilian Needs," criticizing the State-owned Shenyang Medical Instrument Factory for accumulating a large backlog of products. Subsequently, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, the former Northeast Finance and Economics Committee, the Tiexi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shenyang, and the Northeast Office of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, along with other relevant leading departments, jointly organized a joint inspection team to inspect the factory and help improve its work. The joint inspection team stayed there for nearly three months and discovered that the problems were much more serious than those revealed by the *Shenyang Daily*. For example, the joint inspection team confirmed the *Shenyang Daily*'s revelation that the factory was unwilling to determine product types and quantities according to market needs, and that the surgical knives, scissors, tweezers, and forceps manufactured by the factory were too bulky, and hospitals in Shenyang were unwilling to use them. It was also found that the factory had serious waste in the production process. In the first quarter, the rework rate for sharp surgical scissors was 41.48%, the rework rate for curved, fully-toothed hemostatic forceps was 72.69%, and the rework rate for pliers was 60.25%. The rework rate for the other 23 products was between 10% and 30%. This situation had not improved by June, and the rework rate for many products was still above 50%. Nearly half of the factory's equipment was not used for a long time, and there was also a surplus of labor in various types of work, but the factory entrusted a large number of parts and components to private factories for processing.

The high rework rate was due to the poor quality of semi-finished products. However, after rework, the quality of the finished products was still very poor. Knives, scissors, tweezers, and forceps were not only too bulky, but also poorly made in key parts. For example, the blades of knives and scissors were easily dulled, and hemostatic forceps would "dance" during use, posing a great threat to the lives of patients. The main product - ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machines - had a standard wavelength of 7 meters, but some finished products had a wavelength of 12 meters. The small transformers and wires of this type of electrotherapy machine were not installed properly and emitted a呜呜 sound during use. The examination beds were not wide enough, and patients would fall to the ground when they turned over.

The poor product quality of the Shenyang Medical Instrument Factory has existed for a long time. In the autumn of 1952, when Soviet expert Comrade Leontev came to the factory, he pointed out that products such as tweezers, forceps, and scissors were too bulky and heavy, which were not easy to use and wasted materials. At that time, Comrade Leontev said very sincerely: "China has not yet entered a period of planned large-scale construction. Your factory is close to Anshan and does not feel the lack of steel, and thinks it doesn't matter if you waste some materials. When large-scale construction starts in the future, you will feel that there is not enough steel." It has been almost two years since our country started planned large-scale construction, but Comrade Leontev's opinion has not been taken seriously. At the beginning of this year, when the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry was compiling the annual plan, it considered not letting the factory manufacture ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machines because the quality of the factory's products was not good. At that time, Comrade Li Wenyuan, the factory director, personally went to Beijing and said that he guaranteed the quality would not be lower than that of other factories. But the factory director's guarantee was not fulfilled.

This time, in order to effectively help the factory improve its work, the joint inspection team spent a long time analyzing the reasons for the poor product quality in depth. The analysis concluded that it was mainly due to the weakness of technical management. For example, the factory only had product quality indicators, but no quality standards and tools for measurement. Inspection work was based solely on eyesight. Inspectors often had different requirements for the same product. Some products did not have operating procedures. The sand used for sand casting was only screened once a year, and new sand was used without being mixed, so the quality of the castings was very poor. During operation, no attention was paid to the protection of semi-finished products, and the blades of knives and scissors were damaged after being ground well. The product was originally specified to be nickel-plated for 30 minutes and 40 minutes, but in reality, in order to "catch up with the task," some products were only plated for 20 to 25 minutes. Chromium plating was also not done for the specified time, and in order to speed up the electroplating speed, more products were hung up each time than specified, resulting in uneven coating due to too small a gap, which would fall off after a short period of use.

Due to the lack of a sense of responsibility among product designers, the quality of many products was poor and the specifications were not met, which was often doomed at the time of product design. The dental chair was drawn based on a sample borrowed from the Northeast Medical University, which was not very complicated, but there were many errors in the drawn drawings, and some parts were even unknown where to install. The model drawing of a large tweezer had been changed four times in the production process, and 10,000 tweezers were reworked four times accordingly. The outer groove of the 12-inch electric sterilizer was clearly specified to be 177 mm wide, but the designer mistakenly wrote it as 117 mm wide. What is especially inexcusable is that after the factory entrusted with processing discovered and pointed out this error, the designer still did not correct it. The quality of product design was so poor that even the Production Technology Section responsible for the design did not dare to be responsible, and the workshop often doubted the reliability of the drawings and did not produce according to the drawings. Many product parts were taken to the Production Technology Section for "identification" after they were manufactured.

The poor planning of the production process and the rush to complete tasks at the end of the month were also the reasons for the poor product quality. At the end of March this year, the factory's leading cadres saw that the plan could not be completed, so they mobilized the personnel of the departments to go to the workshop for packaging. These people neither understood the business nor were they in a hurry, so some sterilizer shells were nailed when they were packed, and some parts were dropped. Some people were even so busy that they packed the packaging tools and products together in the box. At this time, quality inspection was even more sloppy, and many unqualified parts were taken for installation as qualified parts. The capitalists who accepted the entrusted processing accurately grasped this law and often came to deliver goods at the end of the month.

Did the leading cadres of the factory not know about the problems that the joint inspection team had discovered? They knew. Although the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, which was responsible for leadership, had not provided enough inspection, supervision and assistance to the factory in the past, the factory's workers had made suggestions more than once, and the comrades of the Northeast Pharmaceutical Company, which was responsible for promoting the factory's products, had also made suggestions more than once. So, what is the key to the factory's long-term tolerance of the existence of poor product quality? Listen to what Comrade Li Wenyuan, the factory director, said and you will understand:

"It is true that our product quality is not good enough. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, during the War of Liberation, and in the revolutionary base areas, weren't bamboo skins used to replace tweezers? What are we using now? What does it matter if the product is a little bigger or smaller, a little longer or shorter?..."

Comrade Li Wenyuan said this in response to others' accusations of the factory's product quality. The root of the problem lies here: they compare themselves with the past and look backwards. Starting from this point of view, they believe that people's requirements for product quality are too harsh, and that people are divorced from the factory's historical situation. They feel that in 1949, the factory could only manufacture simple surgical knives, scissors, tweezers, forceps and other so-called "four major categories"; now it can manufacture ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machines, instrument cabinets, transport vehicles and other large products, and can also manufacture electric water baths, drying ovens, thermostats and other technically complex products. How fast has it developed, what else do you want? As for the backlog of products, that is because the Northeast Pharmaceutical Company is not promoting it well and has nothing to do with product quality. Therefore, when the joint inspection team first arrived at the factory, most of the leading cadres headed by the factory director felt a little wronged and said to the comrades of the inspection team: "Why don't you go to inspect the pharmaceutical company's promotion work?" After the inspection team criticized the shortcomings in the factory's production, some of the factory's leading cadres, such as Chen Yulu, deputy director of the Supervision Office, not only did not feel distressed by the loss of state property, but instead protested this criticism that "reduced the prestige of the leadership" (!). The factory's leading cadres often shouted that there was a shortage of technical personnel, but in April and May this year, when Engineer Wang Xiqi and a technician sent by the Central Ministry of Light Industry to help the factory proposed suggestions for improving quality and helped to draft new product trial production procedures, Li Run堂, the head of the Production Technology Section who was in charge of the factory's technical work, said: "It is difficult to implement," and later simply refused to meet with Engineer Wang, making it impossible for Engineer Wang to work for ten consecutive days.

With the specific help of the joint inspection team, the Shenyang Medical Instrument Factory began to formulate some quality assurance systems, initially strengthened the leadership of technical work, and improved the enterprise's planning management. However, because the factory's leading cadres have not completely eliminated the erroneous view of looking backwards, they are not resolute and conscious enough in implementing various measures to improve quality, so old problems have not been completely overcome, and new problems continue to occur. From January to September this year, except for March, no month was able to complete the state's production plan.

No looking back. Now is the time for the leading cadres of the Shenyang Medical Instrument Factory to thoroughly eliminate erroneous views.

    向后看不得
    向千
    今年三月二十九日，沈阳日报第二版登载了一篇题为“轻工业的产品必须适应国需民用”的文章，批评国营沈阳医疗器械厂积压了大批产品。接着中央轻工业部医药工业管理局和原东北财委、中共沈阳铁西区委员会、中央轻工业部东北办事处等有关领导部门，共同组织一个联合检查组到该厂检查，并帮助改进工作。联合检查组在那里住了将近三个月，发现的问题比沈阳日报揭露的严重得多。例如，联合检查组证实沈阳日报揭露的该厂不愿按照市场需要确定产品品种和数量，该厂制造的外科手术用的刀、剪、镊和钳太笨重，沈阳市的医院都不愿使用等情况。还发现该厂在生产过程中的浪费现象很严重。在第一季度，尖手术剪子的返工率为百分之四十一点四八，弯全齿止血钳的返工率为百分之七十二点六九，皮钳子的返工率为百分之六十点二五，其他二十三种产品的返工率都在百分之十到三十之间。这种情况到六月份还没有好转，许多产品的返工率还在百分之五十以上。该厂将近一半的设备长期未被利用，各工种的劳动力也有剩余，但该厂却把大量的部件、零件委托私营工厂加工。
    返工率高是因为半成品的质量不好。但是返工之后，成品的质量仍然很坏。刀、剪、镊、钳不仅太笨重，而且关键部分都做得不好。如刀子、剪子刃部易钝，止血钳子使用时会“跳舞”，对患病者的生命威胁很大。主要产品——超短波电疗机，标准波长是七公尺，而有的成品波长是十二公尺。这种电疗机的小变压器和电线都安装得不好，使用时发出呜呜的声音。诊察床不够宽，病人一翻身便掉到地上。
    沈阳医疗器械厂产品质量不好的情况很早就存在了。一九五二年秋天，苏联专家列昂节夫同志到该厂时，就指出镊、钳、剪等产品太笨太重，既不好使用，又浪费材料。当时列昂节夫同志非常诚恳地说：“现在中国还没有进入有计划的大规模建设时期，你们工厂距离鞍山又近，还感不到钢材缺乏，认为浪费点材料没关系。将来大规模建设开始了，你们就感到钢材不够了。”我国进行有计划的大规模的建设快两年了，列昂节夫同志的意见还没被重视。今年年初，中央轻工业部医药工业管理局编制年度计划时，就曾经考虑不要该厂制造超短波电疗机，因为该厂制造的质量不好。当时，该厂厂长李文元同志亲自到北京来说，保证质量绝不低于其它工厂。但厂长的保证也没有实现。
    这一次，联合检查组为了切实帮助该厂改进工作，花了很长时间深入分析产品质量不好的原因。分析的结果，认为主要是由于技术管理工作薄弱。例如，这个厂只有产品质量指标，但没有衡量质量的标准和工具，检查工作单凭眼力。检查员对同一件产品的要求，常常前后不一样。有些产品没有操作规程。翻砂用的砂子每年只筛一次，新的砂子没有拌匀就使用，所以铸件的质量很不好。在操作当中，对半成品不注意保护，刀、剪的刃部研磨好了又给碰坏。产品镀镍本来规定三十分钟和四十分钟两种，而实际上为了“赶任务”，有些产品只镀了二十至二十五分钟。镀铬也没有做够规定的时间，并且为了加快电镀速度，每次都超过规定多挂产品，结果因间隔太小，镀层不匀，使用不久便脱落了。
    由于产品设计人员的责任心不强，许多产品的质量不好，规格不合，往往在产品设计的时候就注定了。牙科椅子是根据从东北医科大学借来的一台样品照物描图的，并不算复杂，但绘出来图纸却有不少错误，甚至有些零件不知往那里安装。有一种大镊子的模型图纸，在生产过程中改过四次，一万把镊子也跟着返工四次。十二吋电气消毒器的外槽，明明规定一百七十七公厘宽，设计人员却误写为一百一十七公厘宽。尤其不应该的是，受委托加工的工厂发现并指出这个错误后，设计者仍不改正。产品设计的质量差到连负责设计的生产技术科都不敢负责，车间也常常怀疑图纸的可靠性，不按照图纸生产，不少产品零件都是制造完以后，才拿去请生产技术科“鉴定”。
    生产过程的计划性差，月末赶任务，也是造成产品质量不好的原因。今年三月末，厂的领导干部眼望计划完不成了，就动员科室人员下车间包装。这些人既不懂业务，又匆匆忙忙，所以有的消毒器外壳在装箱时被钉坏了，有的零件给弄掉了。有的人甚至忙得把装箱用的工具和产品一起装进箱子里去。在这个时候，质量检验更马虎，许多不合格的零件也被当作合格的零件拿去安装。接受委托加工的资本家摸准了这个规律，往往到了月末才来交货。
    联合检查组检查出来的问题，难道该厂的领导干部一点也不知道吗？知道的。虽然负领导责任的轻工业部医药工业管理局过去对该厂的检查督促和帮助得不够，但是，该厂工人已经不止一次地提过意见，负责推销该厂产品的东北区医药公司的同志们也不止一次地提过意见了。那末，该厂长期地容忍产品质量低劣的情况存在，关键在哪里呢？听一听厂长李文元同志的话便明白了：
      “我们产品质量不够好是事实。但是，在抗日战争时期，在解放战争时期，在革命根据地，不是用竹皮代替过镊子吗？现在用的是什么呢？产品大点小点、长点短点有什么关系呢？……”
    李文元同志这句话，是为答复别人对该厂产品质量的指责而说的。问题的根源就在这里：他们跟过去比，向后看。他们从这个观点出发，认为人们对产品质量的要求过苛，认为人们是脱离该厂的历史情况的。他们觉得：一九四九年的时候，工厂只能制造简单的外科手术刀、剪、镊、钳等所谓“四大类”；现在已能制造超短波电疗机、器械柜、搬运车等大型产品，还能制造电水浴锅、干燥箱、恒温器等技术较复杂的产品。发展得多快呀，还要求什么呢？至于产品积压，那是因为东北区医药公司推销不力，跟产品质量无关。所以，联合检查组刚到该厂的时候，以厂长为首的大部分领导干部感到有点委屈，对检查组的同志说：“你们为什么不去检查医药公司的推销工作啊？”检查组批评了该厂生产中的缺点以后，该厂部分领导干部，如监察室副主任陈玉禄等同志，不仅不因国家财产遭受损失而痛心，反而抗议这个“降低领导威信”（！）的批评。该厂的领导干部常常喊技术力量不足，但今年四、五月间，中央轻工业部派到该厂帮助工作的汪锡棋工程师和一位技术员，主动提出改进质量的建议，帮助拟出新产品试制程序的时候，该厂领导技术工作的生产技术科科长李润堂说：“碍难实行”，后来干脆不跟汪工程师见面，使汪工程师一连十几天不能进行工作。
    在联合检查组的具体帮助下，沈阳医疗器械厂开始制订了一些保证质量的制度，初步加强了对技术工作的领导和改进了企业的计划管理。但是，因为该厂领导干部并没有完全清除向后看的错误观点，对于贯彻改进质量的各种措施不够坚决和自觉，所以，旧的毛病没有完全克服，新的毛病又不断发生。今年一月到九月，除了三月份外，没有一个月能完成国家的生产计划。
    向后看不得。现在该是沈阳医疗器械厂的领导干部彻底清除错误观点的时候了。
