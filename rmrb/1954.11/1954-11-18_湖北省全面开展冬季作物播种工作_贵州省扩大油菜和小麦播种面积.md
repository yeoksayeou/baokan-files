    Hubei Province has fully launched winter planting work. The province plans to plant over 41 million mu of winter crops, an increase of 8% compared to last year's winter planting area. Among them, the grain area has increased by 6.6%, and the rapeseed area has increased by 44.1%. According to statistics from early November, the area already planted in the province accounts for approximately 60% of the planned area, with the oilseed area accounting for 64% of the planned area.
    Currently, various parts of Hubei Province are strengthening leadership over winter planting work. The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions requiring all counties to expand rapeseed planting area through seedling cultivation and transplantation methods. Huangmei, Guangji, and other nine counties have convened meetings of district party secretaries and district heads, demanding that unified procurement be combined with winter planting to complete winter planting tasks with a concentrated effort. After discovering that 16 disaster-stricken townships in Xianning County had a tendency to emphasize sideline occupations over agriculture, the county specifically convened a meeting of cadres in disaster areas to deploy winter planting production tasks. Recently, varying degrees of drought have occurred in various places, which has seriously affected winter planting production. Cadres in various places are actively leading the masses in fighting drought. Cadres in Tianjing Township, Huangpi County, organized more than 300 people to draw water to irrigate fields and seize the time for plowing and planting. The Party branch of Hebian Township, Yingcheng County, organized more than 100 people to carry water and use soil to plant seeds, and has already rushed to plant more than 1,200 mu.
    In order to assist in the progress of winter planting work, the financial departments of Hubei Province have allocated more than 70 million jin of winter crop seeds and more than 60 million jin of fertilizer.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province are expanding the planting of rapeseed and wheat. Currently, in most areas of the province that are about to complete autumn planting, the planting area of rapeseed and wheat is generally more than 30% larger than last year. In some areas, the rapeseed planting area has even expanded by 70% to 100%. In the past, high-altitude mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas that rarely planted wheat are also widely planting rapeseed and wheat this year.
    During autumn planting, farmers of all ethnic groups have generally improved cultivation techniques and applied more fertilizer. Ethnic minority farmers in the remote Wangmo County mostly changed from broadcasting to spot planting when planting rapeseed and wheat, and applied a large amount of fertilizer. The twelve agricultural production cooperatives in the Miao Autonomous Region of Taijiang County have accumulated 1.34 million jin of manure and grass fertilizer, preparing it for top dressing.

    湖北省全面开展冬季作物播种工作
    贵州省扩大油菜和小麦播种面积
    湖北省已全面开展冬播工作。全省计划冬播作物共四千一百多万亩，比去年冬播面积扩大百分之八。其中粮食面积扩大百分之六点六，油菜面积扩大百分之四十四点一。据十一月上旬统计，全省已经进行冬播的面积占计划面积的百分之六十左右，其中油料面积占计划面积的百分之六十四。
    现在，湖北省各地正在加强对冬播工作的领导。中共襄阳地委发出指示，要求各县以育苗移苗的办法来扩大油菜种植面积。黄梅、广济等九县，已召开区委书记和区长会议，要求统购要结合冬播进行，突击完成冬播任务。咸宁县发现十六个受灾乡有重副业轻农业的偏向后，专门召开了灾区干部会议，布置冬播生产任务。最近，各地发生程度不同的旱象，已严重影响了冬播生产，各地干部正积极领导群众抗旱。黄陂县天井乡干部组织群众三百多人车水灌田，抢耕抢种。应城县河边乡党支部组织群众一百多人，挑水打土点种，已抢种一千二百多亩。
    湖北省财经部门为了协助冬播工作的进行，已拨出七千多万斤冬播作物种籽和六千多万斤肥料。

    贵州省各族农民扩大播种油菜和小麦。目前全省大部即将完成秋种的地区，油菜和小麦的播种面积一般比去年扩大百分之三十以上，有些地区油菜播种面积还扩大了百分之七十到一倍左右。过去很少种植小麦的高寒山区和少数民族地区今年也普遍播种了油菜和小麦。
    各族农民在秋种中，普遍改进了耕作技术，多施了肥料。边远的望谟县少数民族农民，种油菜和小麦时，大部将撒播改为点播，并施了大量肥料。台江县苗族自治区的十二个农业生产合作社，已积粪肥和草肥一百三十四万斤，准备作追肥用。
