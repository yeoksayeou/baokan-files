Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS, the Soviet Peace Committee has recently been receiving letters daily from Soviet patriots across the country. In their letters, they express warm support for the Soviet government's peace policy and its proposals for establishing an all-European collective security system and peacefully resolving the German question. Many letters also protest the London and Paris agreements, which aim to revive German militarism, and resolutely advocate a complete ban on the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Galkin, a teacher from the village of Belotserkovka in the Ukrainian Republic, wrote in his letter: "Humanity does not want a war that plunges the people of all countries into severe poverty and suffering. For the prosperity of their own countries and the improvement of the material conditions of the working people, the people of all countries hope to live and create in a peaceful and friendly environment."

Kucheluk, a member of a collective farm in the Stalinino Oblast, wrote in a letter: "Anyone who wants to live, work, and love should loudly proclaim: Down with the warmongers, strive for world peace!" Kolkin, a member of a collective farm in the Kostroma Oblast of the Russian Federation, reflected the thoughts and feelings of millions of Soviet people in his letter. He said: "Science should serve the progress and peace of mankind. We must not allow the flames of war to rekindle. The road to happiness is broad, and for the sake of our next generation, the people of all countries should strive for this happiness."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS, the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge has held a total of 215,000 lectures and reports throughout the Soviet Union this year, with an audience of over 50 million people. The content of the lectures and reports included: the international situation and the struggles of the people of all countries to defend peace, the role of the Soviet Union in the struggle to ease international tensions, and the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The lecturers and speakers are all famous Soviet scientists, writers, artists, advanced workers in industry and agriculture, and social celebrities.

The Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge has also published many pamphlets to promote the great significance of maintaining peace, expanding friendly ties between the people of all countries, and ensuring international security. Each pamphlet is printed in 150,000 to 200,000 copies.
