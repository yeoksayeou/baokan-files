Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: The U.S. government, in blatant disregard of international law and basic human rights, forcibly abducted twenty-two Polish crew members from the Polish merchant ships "Praca" and "President Gottwald," who were illegally detained by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to the United States on October 27th using a special U.S. Navy aircraft.

The U.S. government attempts to portray this act of political kidnapping as granting the abducted Polish crew members so-called "political asylum." This lie does not absolve the United States of responsibility for this incident or conceal the truth. As everyone knows, since the United States directly assisted the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in hijacking the aforementioned two Polish merchant ships in October of last year and May of this year, special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the direction of the United States, have resorted to various terror tactics to force the illegally imprisoned Polish crew members to betray their country. This despicable conspiracy has been resolutely resisted by the Polish crew members. The U.S. government's blatant abduction of twenty-two Polish crew members to the United States further confirms its direct involvement in the pirate act of hijacking Polish merchant ships on the high seas along with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and contains a shameful political conspiracy.

    美国政府公然蹂躏国际法规和基本人权
    竟把被蒋贼强迫扣留的波兰船员多人劫持到美国去
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国政府公然蹂躏国际法规和基本人权，竟在十月二十七日把被蒋介石卖国集团非法扣留的波兰商船“工作号”和“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的波兰籍船员二十二人，用美国海军专机强行从台湾劫持到美国去。
    美国政府企图把这种政治性绑架的行为说成是给予被绑架的波兰船员以所谓“政治庇护”。这种谎言丝毫不能使美国摆脱对这一事件的责任和掩饰事实的真相。大家知道，自从美国直接帮助蒋介石卖国集团在去年十月和今年五月把上述两艘波兰商船劫夺以来，蒋介石卖国集团的特务分子在美国的指使下，曾采取种种恐怖手段强迫被非法监禁的波兰船员背叛祖国。这种卑鄙的阴谋遭到波兰船员的坚决反抗。美国政府这次公然把波兰船员二十二人劫持到美国去的行为，进一步证实它和蒋介石卖国集团在公海劫夺波兰商船的海盗行为直接有关，并且含藏着可耻的政治阴谋。
