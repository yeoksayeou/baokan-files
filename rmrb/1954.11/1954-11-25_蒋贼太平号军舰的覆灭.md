    The Demise of the Chiang Bandit's "Taiping" Warship
    On November 13th, a drizzle fell on the sea off the coast of Zhejiang. Naval vessels of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were patrolling in the turbulent waves. The sailors' clothes were soaked with rain, and the cold sea wind blew in gusts. But regardless of the cold, the young sailors stood vigilantly on the ships cutting through the waves, carefully observing the sea of their motherland. In the evening, the wind and waves at sea had calmed down. But the sailors maintained their vigilance in defending the motherland's ocean. Around 1:00 AM on the 14th, a combat order from the commander suddenly reached the ships: "A Chiang bandit warship has been spotted between Dachen Island and the Yushan Islands, harassing our waters. Prepare to attack!"
    The battle that the sailors had been waiting for day and night was about to begin, and the ships immediately buzzed with excitement. The sounds of engines, the whirring of machinery, and the sailors' requests for assignments blended into one. The crimes of the Chiang bandit warships in robbing fishing boats and merchant ships at sea, massacring fishermen, and shelling our coastal islands and mainland once again appeared in the sailors' minds. They were determined to use heroic combat to eliminate the Chiang bandit warships that the people of the motherland hated.
    According to military protocol, each ship held a flag-raising ceremony, and the solemn five-star red flag fluttered on the mast. The ships formed a combat formation and bravely advanced in the sea. At this time, the sea wind that had just calmed down picked up again, and large waves crashed one after another, with spray splashing onto the deck and seawater hitting the sailors. Sun Xitian, who was on lookout duty, had seawater flowing from his neck all the way down to his heels. He constantly wiped the seawater from his face and continued to observe the sea. Suddenly, he reported to the commander:
    "A flash of light was spotted on the starboard side!"
    "Strengthen observation!" the commander replied.
    Before long, the sailors saw a long, dark shadow appear on the distant sea. Judging from the shape of the ship, it was the "Taiping" warship of the Chiang bandit navy.
    Our warships continued to advance rapidly towards the Chiang bandit warship. At this time, the sailors could already see the anchor claws on the bow of the Chiang bandit warship. The sailors felt an unspeakable joy in their hearts.
      At 1:30 AM, the commander issued the order to attack the Chiang bandit warship. Each ship immediately formed an attack formation and accelerated forward. They were getting closer and closer to the Chiang bandit warship. Just as the commander issued the command "Ready—Fire!", each ship immediately launched a fierce bombardment of the Chiang bandit warship. After receiving a sudden and fierce blow, the guns on the Chiang bandit warship fired aimlessly.
    Under the continuous and fierce bombardment of the sailors, the Chiang bandit warship was immediately hit. The black smoke rising from the bow enveloped the bridge and conning tower, and the huge columns of water that erupted from both sides of the ship instantly submerged the middle of the hull. At this time, the surviving cannons on the Chiang bandit warship fired even more frantically.
    Our brave sailors safely and quickly reversed course after completing their combat mission. They looked back at the Chiang bandit warship, which was still firing blindly, and said excitedly, "Keep firing! In a little while, you'll sink to the bottom of the sea to feed the fish!"
    After being hit, the Chiang bandit warship drifted on the sea with the tide for more than three hours. At dawn, the commanders and fighters guarding this island excitedly ran to the coast to watch. Facing the rising sun, they watched with joy as the gray silhouette of the Chiang bandit warship sank. In the sea near the Chiang bandit "Taiping" warship, some Chiang bandits were struggling in the waves. A "Tai"-class warship that had come from Dachen Island was desperately towing the "Taiping" warship, which was about to completely sink. Around 7:00 AM, the hull of the Chiang bandit "Taiping" warship sank sharply, and the "Tai"-class warship that was dragging it towards Dachen Island quickly cut the tow cable. The stern of the "Taiping" warship rose high, and the waves quickly submerged the bridge and conning tower. At 7:30 AM, the raging sea swallowed the highest mast of the "Taiping" warship. Thus, this escort destroyer, given by American imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out a treasonous war, was buried in the turbulent ocean by our heroic People's Navy.

    蒋贼太平号军舰的覆灭
    十一月十三日，浙江海面的天空降着蒙蒙细雨。中国人民解放军海军某部队的舰艇在汹涌的海浪中巡逻着。水兵们的衣服都被雨水淋湿了，寒冷的海风阵阵地吹到他们的身上。但是年青的水兵们不顾怎样寒冷，仍然警惕地站在破浪前进的舰艇上，仔细地观察着祖国的海面。晚上，海上的风浪已经平静下来。但水兵们还是保持着守卫祖国海洋的警惕性。到十四日一时许，指挥员的作战命令忽然传到舰艇上：“在大陈岛和渔山列岛之间的海面上，发现蒋贼军舰一艘向我骚扰，准备出击！”
    水兵们日夜盼望着的战斗就要来到了，舰艇上立即沸腾起来。马达声、机器转动声和水兵们要求任务的报告声响成一片。蒋贼军舰在海上抢劫渔船、商轮，屠杀渔民，炮击我沿海岛屿和大陆的罪行，也再次重现在水兵们心头上，他们决心要用英勇的战斗来消灭祖国人民痛恨的蒋贼军舰。
    按照军礼，各舰艇举行了升旗仪式，庄严的五星国旗在旗杆上飘扬着。各舰艇列成战斗队形，在大海中奋勇前进。这时，平息不久的海风又刮起来了，大浪一个接一个地打来，浪花翻上甲板，海水打在水兵们的身上。正在了望的孙锡田，海水从他的脖子一直流到脚跟。他不时地抹去脸上的海水，继续观察着海面。忽然，他向指挥员报告：
    “右舷发现闪了一下火光！”
    “加强观察！”指挥员回答。
    不一会，水兵们便看见在远处海面上出现了一个长长的黑影，从舰形上判断，它就是蒋贼海军的太平号军舰。
    我军舰艇继续迅速地向蒋贼军舰前进。这时，水兵们已经看到了蒋贼军舰舰首上的锚爪了。水兵们心里真是说不出的高兴。
      一时三十分，指挥员发出了向蒋贼军舰攻击的命令。各舰艇立即组成了进攻队形，并加快速度向前驶进。离蒋贼军舰越来越近了。指挥员刚发出了“预备—放！”的口令，各舰艇立即向这艘蒋贼军舰展开了猛烈的轰击。蒋贼军舰受到突然而猛烈的打击以后，舰上的炮毫无目标地轰击起来。
    在水兵们连续不断的猛烈轰击下，这艘蒋贼军舰当即被击中了，舰头部分冒起的黑烟笼罩了驾驶台和舰桥，从舰两旁冲起的巨大的水柱也顿时漫没了舰身中部。这时，蒋贼军舰上残存的大炮更加慌乱地发射着。
    我军勇敢的水兵们在完成战斗任务后安全地迅速反航了。他们回头望着仍在盲目发射着炮火的蒋贼军舰，兴奋地说：“尽管打吧！等一会你就要沉下海底去喂鱼啦！”
    这艘蒋贼军舰被击中后，在海面上顺着潮水飘荡了三个多小时。拂晓时候，守卫在这个海岛上的指挥员、战斗员们都兴奋地跑到海岸上去观望。他们迎着露出海面的朝阳，欢腾地观看着这艘蒋贼军舰正在下沉的灰影。在蒋贼太平号军舰附近的海面上，有些蒋贼军正在浪涛中挣扎着。有一艘从大陈岛赶来的太字号军舰，正在绝望地拖着将要完全下沉的太平号军舰。七时左右，蒋贼太平号军舰舰身急剧下沉了，拖着它向大陈岛爬行的那艘太字号军舰赶忙砍断拖带链索，太平号军舰的舰尾高高地翘了起来，海浪迅速地漫没了驾驶台和舰桥。七时三十分，汹涌的海水吞没了太平号军舰上最高的一根桅杆，这艘由美帝国主义送给蒋介石卖国集团用来进行叛国战争的护航驱逐舰，就这样被我英勇的人民海军给埋葬在波涛汹涌的海洋里了。　（新华社）
