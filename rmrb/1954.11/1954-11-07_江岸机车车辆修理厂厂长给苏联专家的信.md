Letter from the Director of the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to Soviet Experts

Dear Comrade Yaroshenko, Soviet Expert:

    On the occasion of the October Socialist Revolution Day, I extend to you my warm congratulations and heartfelt gratitude. In our country's socialist construction, we feel at every moment the sincere assistance given to us by the great Soviet Union, and the deep, brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Taking the development of our factory over the past year as an example, it is because of your many valuable contributions that we have achieved what we have.

    In the first half of last year, our factory's production was very chaotic, and we failed to meet the state plan for six consecutive months. It was at this time that you came to our factory and pointed out that the key problem was the failure to implement the Ministry of Railways' Directive No. 301, formulated based on advanced Soviet experience and China's actual conditions. You pointed out that we had not strengthened planning management and implemented the system of "three-level management with one leader," which made it impossible to scientifically organize daily production. However, at first, we did not truly grasp the spirit of your suggestion, so we did not implement it well. Later, you explained to me in detail how to implement the Ministry of Railways' directive, strengthen planning management, and implement the "three-level management with one leader" system, and solved many difficult problems for me.

    Dear Comrade Yaroshenko, your patient help finally made me realize that the head of a socialist enterprise must use a scientific method to direct production, and that my past mistake was leading production with a handicraft method. I also realized from this that the suggestions of Soviet experts must be carefully studied, and that only by grasping its spirit can it be accurately implemented. Under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee and the factory Party committee, I, along with all the workers in the factory, earnestly studied your suggestions, resolutely implemented the Ministry of Railways' directive, strengthened planning management and implemented the "three-level management with one leader" system, and carried out a serious struggle against those free and undisciplined habits that were incompatible with the principles of socialist enterprise management.

    Because of the unwavering implementation of your suggestions, our factory's production has made great progress since the third quarter of last year, transforming from chaos to order, from failing to meet the plan every month to completing the plan evenly by ten-day periods, and labor productivity has also increased. The factory is expected to complete 118.1 percent of the annual plan for total output value this year, an increase of 33.9 percent over last year's actual performance; labor productivity is expected to complete 116.2 percent of the annual plan, an increase of 23.8 percent over last year's actual performance. Our factory has therefore gained honor. In the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, our factory successively won the banner of excellence three times in the national railway factory cyclical red banner competition. The Ministry of Railways recently awarded me a "Glorious Railway Worker" medal. Dear expert comrade, the progress and honor of our factory are inseparable from your enthusiastic and sincere help. Sino-Soviet friendship has blossomed brilliantly between us!

    Dear Comrade Yaroshenko, in order to help our factory continue to move forward, you came to our factory again in February of this year and gave us suggestions on rationally organizing construction sites, strengthening systematic production preparation, and promoting technical operation processes, pointing out that the direction of our progress lies in strengthening technical organizational work. In order to enable us to truly understand your suggestions, you introduced to us the advanced experience of the main car workshop in establishing an assembly warehouse at the railway station, even fifteen minutes before you boarded the train to return to Beijing. When we formulated eleven specific technical organizational work plans based on your suggestions, it was the day before you returned to your country for vacation in early July, and you still helped us revise this plan despite your fatigue, and further proposed the suggestion of promoting locomotive assembly line operations. Your serious and responsible attitude is truly worthy of our learning. Recently, we are implementing these eleven plans on the one hand, and continuing to implement the technical responsibility system at all levels stipulated in the Ministry of Railways' directive on the other hand, comprehensively strengthening technical management, improving quality, and reducing costs, in order to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

    Dear Comrade Yaroshenko, I and all the workers in the factory sincerely thank you for your help to our factory, thank the many Soviet expert comrades for their help to our country's economic construction, and thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their multifaceted assistance to our country's socialist construction. The Soviet government's tremendous and sincere assistance has enabled our country to obtain the world's top-notch technical equipment, enabled hundreds and thousands of factory and mine cadres to learn socialist enterprise management knowledge, and enabled countless workers and technicians to master the most advanced technology. These will all accelerate the process of our country's socialist industrialization. I and all the workers in the factory are determined to continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and constantly improve our political and technical level, in order to build our country into a socialist country. Long live the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union!
        Director of Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Jiang Wei

    江岸机车车辆修理厂厂长给苏联专家的信亲爱的苏联专家亚洛申科同志：
    在十月社会主义革命节到来的时候，我谨向您们致以热烈的祝贺和衷心的感谢。在我国社会主义建设中，我们每时每刻都感到伟大的苏联所给予我们的真诚的援助，感到中苏两国人民兄弟般的深厚友谊。就以我们工厂一年多的发展来说，也就是因为得到了您的许多宝贵的帮助。
    去年上半年，我们工厂的生产非常混乱，连续六个月没有完成国家计划。就在这个时候，你来到我们工厂，指出关键问题在于没有贯彻执行铁道部根据苏联先进经验和中国实际情况所制定的三○一号指令，没有加强计划管理和实行三级一长制，以致不能科学地将日常生产组织起来。但是我们最初对您这个建议的精神并没有真正领会，因此执行得很不好。以后您又向我详细讲解怎样贯彻执行铁道部这个指令，加强计划管理和实行三级一长制，并为我解决了许多疑难问题。
    亲爱的亚洛申科同志，您的耐心的帮助，使我终于了解到作为一个社会主义企业的负责人必须用一套科学的方法来指挥生产，而我过去的毛病就在于是以手工业方法领导生产。我也从这里体会到对苏联专家的建议，必须细心钻研，领会了它的精神实质，才能确切地加以贯彻。我在武汉市委和工厂党委的领导下，和全厂职工一道认真学习了您的建议，坚决贯彻铁道部的指令，加强计划管理和实行三级一长制，对那些同社会主义企业管理原则不相容的自由散漫习气进行了严重的斗争。
    由于坚定不移地贯彻了您的建议，我们工厂的生产从去年第三季起，便有了飞跃的进步，由过去的混乱转变为有秩序，由过去月月不能完成计划转变为按旬均衡完成计划，劳动生产率也有了提高。全厂今年预计可以完成总产值年度计划百分之一一八点一，比去年实绩提高百分之三十三点九；劳动生产率预计完成年度计划百分之一一六点二，比去年实绩提高百分之二十三点八。我们工厂因此得到了荣誉。去年下半年和今年第一季，我们工厂在全国铁路工厂循环红旗竞赛中，连续获得了三次优胜红旗。铁道部最近又颁发给我一枚“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章。亲爱的专家同志，我们工厂的进步和荣誉，都是和您的热情真诚的帮助分不开的。中苏友谊在我们之间开出了灿烂的花朵！
    亲爱的亚洛申科同志，为了帮助我们工厂继续前进，您在今年二月又来到了我们工厂，给我们提出了合理组织工地、加强系统的生产准备工作、推行技术作业过程等建议，指出了我们前进的方向是在于加强技术组织工作。为了使我们真正能领会您的建议，您临上车回北京的前十五分钟，还在火车站上给我们介绍主制车间成立组装仓库的先进经验。当我们根据您的建议拟定出十一个具体的技术组织工作方案的时候，正是七月初您回国休假的前一天，您仍然不顾疲倦地帮助我们校订了这个方案，并且进一步提出了推行机车流水作业的建议。您这种认真负责的态度，真值得我们学习。最近，我们正在一方面实施这十一个方案，一方面继续贯彻铁道部指令中所规定的各级技术责任制，全面地加强技术管理，提高质量，降低成本，为完成和超额完成国家计划而努力。
    亲爱的亚洛申科同志，我和全厂职工都诚恳地感谢您对我们工厂的帮助，感谢许多苏联专家同志对我国经济建设的帮助，感谢苏联政府和苏联人民对我国社会主义建设的多方面的援助。苏联政府的巨大的真诚的援助，使我国获得了世界上的头等技术设备，使成百上千的工厂和矿山的干部学会了社会主义企业管理知识，使难以计数的工人和技术人员掌握了最先进的技术。这些都将加速我国社会主义工业化的进行。我和全厂职工都决心继续努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，不断提高自己的政治水平和技术水平，为将我国建设成为一个社会主义国家而努力。中苏兄弟般的友谊万岁！
