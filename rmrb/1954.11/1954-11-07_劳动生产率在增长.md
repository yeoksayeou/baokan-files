    Labor Productivity is Increasing
    By A. Kuzminko, Head of the Combine Team, Mine No. 17, Chistyakovo, Donbas, USSR
    Our mine, like all industrial enterprises in the Donbas, was completely destroyed by the German fascist bandits. With the help of the entire country, the miners restored their beloved enterprise through tenacious labor and quickly raised coal production and labor productivity to pre-war levels. But the Soviet people will not stop at the achievements already made.
    New technical equipment and advanced methods of organizing production have opened up tremendous possibilities for us miners to further increase labor productivity and expand coal production. We have used the "Donbas" coal mining combine in all working faces and adopted the advanced method of organizing production work according to the cycle schedule. However, it should be pointed out that things did not go smoothly when we started to master the combine: the machine was new, and we had no experience in operating the new machine. But these initial setbacks did not prevent the miners from reaching the set goals. We, the machine operators, had to go to the neighboring mines that had successfully used the combine at that time. We persistently learned to master the new technology directly at the working face and in training classes. Our labor and learning produced good results. The coal mining combine was mastered and adopted in all sections of the mine.
    The new machine greatly reduced the labor of the miners, and the new machine took over all the coal mining work—cutting coal, crushing coal, and loading coal into the conveyor. The number of miners working on the working face began to decrease significantly, while coal production increased greatly. The labor productivity of workers has increased significantly.
    The second important condition for greatly increasing labor productivity and expanding coal production is to carry out the work of all working faces and preparation faces in accordance with the cycle schedule. The characteristic of this progressive organization of labor is that all the work of the section is subject to a unified system. Each operation must be completed within the time specified in the chart, and each worker knows very well what work he should complete in each period.
    The improvement of labor productivity also depends largely on the miners' mining knowledge. In our work team and in the sections, great attention is paid to enabling each worker to learn several jobs. In our work team, like many other combine work teams and tunneling work teams, miners have two or three specialties. Everyone in the work team can set up supports in the working face, reinforce the working face, operate the conveyor, and some comrades can even drive the combine. When necessary, one miner can replace another, and one person can perform two or three jobs. The work of enabling miners to learn several similar skills is being carried out both in the theoretical study of the mine study group and in the practice of the work area. After the miners have mastered several skills, it is possible to avoid stagnation, make fuller use of the capacity of machines and components, guarantee the work of the whole team with the work of each miner, and improve the labor productivity of each person.
    While improving the skills of the miners and strictly observing the cycle schedule, we also made better use of the mining machines and improved labor productivity. There are three combine work teams working in our section—Grigory Shcherbinko, Ivan Chaustov, and my work team. We have achieved a machine productivity of 18,500 tons of coal per month. In order to mine so much coal, even with the help of coal mining machines, the number of workers required would be one-half or one times more than the workers in our section now. But, I can frankly say that this is far from our limit. The "Donbas" coal mining combine can and must mine more coal. Now we are launching a competition to ensure that our monthly machine coal production is no less than 20,000 tons. This will guarantee a further increase in the labor productivity of our miners.
    The use of coal mining combines in various working faces and the work in accordance with the cycle schedule on the working faces that have been mined and are being prepared ensures the balanced work of all miners and ensures the continuous overfulfillment of the work plan according to various indicators. During this period, the coal production of our mine has almost doubled, while the total number of staff has only increased by a few people. The reason for this is primarily because labor productivity has increased. Labor productivity has doubled. The indicators of other work have also improved significantly. For example, the cost of mining anthracite has been reduced by 22 percent.
    High labor productivity ensures that miners receive high wages. The average wage of miners has increased by 25 percent during the period of working in the new way.
    Miners working in the combine working face can get two thousand to four thousand rubles a month. Such wages can fully guarantee the wealthy life of the miners. The material well-being and cultural level of our miners, like all Soviet people, are improving year by year.
    Not long ago, our city newspaper reported that in the past two years, the miners of Chistyakovo have purchased nearly 2,000 radios, 2,000 bicycles, nearly 300 motorcycles, dozens of pianos, and more than 1.5 million rubles of furniture in the city's stores alone. The turnover of goods has increased by tens of millions of rubles. Hundreds of miners in the city have bought private cars. Many miners in our mine also have their own cars and motorcycles, and hundreds of families have built private houses with their own savings and national credit loans.
    The miners of our mine are successfully completing the national plan and striving to complete the socialist tasks they have undertaken in the competition. Now, we are welcoming the national holiday—the Great October Revolution Day—by over-producing 20,000 tons of coal beyond the plan.
    In response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to celebrate the October Revolution Day, the miners are launching a socialist competition with new strength to strive for high labor productivity—the basis for further improving the national economy and improving the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people.

    劳动生产率在增长
    苏联顿巴斯齐斯特雅科夫市第十七号矿井康拜因工作班班长
  　阿·库兹明科
    我们的矿井，也像顿巴斯所有的工业企业一样，曾遭到德国法西斯强盗的彻底破坏。矿工们在全国的帮助下，在顽强的劳动中把自己亲爱的企业恢复了起来，并很快地把采煤量和劳动生产率提高到战前的水平。但是苏联人是不会停止在已有的成就上的。
    新的技术设备和先进的组织生产的方法，为我们矿工打开了进一步提高劳动生产率和扩大采煤量的巨大可能性。我们在所有的采掘面里都使用了“顿巴斯”采煤康拜因，并采用了先进的按照循环作业表组织生产工作的方法。但是，应该指出，在我们开始掌握康拜因的时候，事情并不是顺利的：机器是新的，我们没有操纵新机器的经验。但是这些最初的挫折并没有能阻止矿工们去达到既定的目标。我们，机器操使者们，不得不到当时已成功地使用了康拜因的邻近矿井去。我们直接在采掘面、在训练班里坚持地学习掌握新技术。我们的劳动和学习产生了良好的效果。采煤康拜因被掌握了，而且在矿井的各个工段都采用了。
    新机器大大地减轻了矿工的劳动，新的机器承担起了全部采煤工作——截煤、碎煤和把煤装进输送机的工作。在采掘面上工作的矿工开始显著地减少，而采煤量却大大增加了。工人的劳动生产率显著地提高了。
    大大地提高劳动生产率和扩大采煤量的第二个重要条件是使一切采掘面和准备工作面的工作都按照循环作业表来进行。这种进步的组织劳动的特点，就是工段的一切工作都服从于一个统一的制度。每一个操作都要在图表所规定的时间内完成，每一个工人都很清楚地知道他在每一段时间内应当完成的工作。
    劳动生产率的提高也多半取决于工人的矿业知识。在我们的工作班和各工段里，很注意使每个工人都学会几种工作。在我们工作班里，也像其他许多康拜因工作班和巷道掘进工作班一样，矿工们都有两三种专长。工作班的每一个人都能在工作面搭支架，加固采掘面，操使输送机，个别同志并能驾驶康拜因。必要时，一个矿工就可以代替另一个矿工，一个人可以兼任两三种工作。使矿工学会相近的几种本领，这一工作，无论在矿井学习组的理论学习上和在工作地段的实践中，都在进行着。矿工们掌握了几种本领后，就有可能避免停歇现象，更充分地使用机器和机件的能力，用每个矿工的工作保证全班的工作，提高每个人的劳动生产率。
    在提高矿工们的技能和严格地遵守循环作业表进行工作时，我们也更好地使用了采矿机并提高了劳动生产率。在我们工段工作的有三个康拜因工作班——格里哥利·薛兴科、伊万·恰乌斯托夫和我的工作班。我们使机器的生产率达到了每月采煤一万八千五百吨。为了采出这样多的煤，即使借助挖煤机，所需要的工人也要比现在我们工段的工人多二分之一或一倍。但是，我可以坦白地说，这远不是我们的极限。“顿巴斯”采煤康拜因能够而且一定能够开采出更多的煤。现在我们正在展开争取自己的每月机器采煤量不少于二万吨的竞赛。这将保证进一步提高我们矿工的劳动生产率。
    在各个采掘面上采用采煤康拜因，在已开采的和进行准备工作的工作面上按循环作业表进行工作，保证了全体矿工的均衡工作，保证了按照各种指标不断地超额完成工作计划。在这段期间，我们矿井的采煤量几乎增加了一倍，而工作人员总共只增加了几个人。所以做到了这点，首先是因为劳动生产率提高了。劳动生产率已增加了一倍。其他工作的指标也显著地改进了。例如，开采无烟煤的成本已降低了百分之二十二。
    劳动的高度生产率保证使矿工们获得了高额工资。在按新方式工作期间矿工的工资平均增加了百分之二十五。
    在康拜因采掘面工作的矿工，一个月可以得到二千到四千卢布。这样的工资完全可以保证矿工们的富裕生活。我们矿工们的物质福利和文化水平，也像所有的苏联人一样，一年一年地在提高。
    不久以前，我们的市报纸曾报道说，最近两年来，齐斯特雅科沃的矿工只在城内的商店里就买了近两千架收音机、两千辆自行车、近三百辆摩托车、数十架钢琴和一百五十多万卢布的家具。商品的流通额增加了数千万卢布。城内的几百个矿工都买到了私人用的小汽车。我们矿井的许多矿工也都有自己的汽车和摩托车，几百个家庭用自己的储金和国家的信用贷款建造了私人住宅。
    我们矿井的矿工顺利地完成着国家的计划，并努力争取完成自己在竞赛中所担负的社会主义任务。现在，我们正以超计划多开采二万吨煤来迎接全民的节日——伟大的十月革命节。
    矿工们为了响应苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝十月革命节的号召，正以新的力量展开了争取高度劳动生产率——进一步提高国民经济和提高苏联人民物质福利和文化水平的基础的社会主义竞赛。
