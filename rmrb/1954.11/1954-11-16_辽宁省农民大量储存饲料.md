Liaoning Province Farmers Store Large Quantities of Feed

    In order to save grain, the farmers of Liaoning Province are actively collecting and storing various feeds. Dalian City plans to dig 4,000 cellars in the suburbs to store 13,000 tons of pig feed before the ground freezes. By the end of October, more than 3,300 earthen cellars had been completed, and the stored feed can feed 30,000 pigs until April of next year. In addition, 1,000 tons of mountain grass were cut in the entire suburbs. Xinjin County farmers collected more than 42 million jin of various pig feeds during the autumn harvest. After learning from the experience of farmers in the suburbs of Dalian City in making fermented feed, the farmers of E'jia Village in the third district of Tai'an County have made 37 jars of fermented feed in the entire village. The county can collect more than 11 million jin of various agricultural and sideline products during the autumn harvest, which is enough for 10,000 pigs to eat for a year. Women in various places have played a significant role in the collection and storage of feed. More than 30 women in Ping'anbao Village, Qingyuan County, have collected more than 250 sacks of bean leaves and other feeds, which can save 4,000 jin of grain.

    辽宁省农民大量储存饲料
    辽宁省农民为了节省粮食，积极采集和贮备各种饲料。旅大市计划全郊区在上冻前挖四千个窖子，贮存猪食一万三千吨，到十月底已完成三千三百多个土窖贮存工作，贮存的饲料可供三万头猪吃到明年四月。另外全郊区还割了山草一千吨。新金县农民在秋收中收集了各种猪食四千二百多万斤。台安县三区鄂家村农民学习旅大市郊区农民制做发酵饲料经验后，全村已做成发酵饲料三十七缸，全县在秋收中可收集各种农副产物一千一百多万斤，可够一万头猪吃一年。在收集和贮备饲料工作中，各地妇女起了很大作用。清原县平安堡村三十多个妇女已收集豆叶等饲料二百五十多麻袋，可以节省粮食四千斤。
