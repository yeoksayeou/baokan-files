Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 20th: According to TASS, East German Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl made a government statement in the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on the 19th, expressing his willingness to send representatives to the Pan-European Conference to discuss the European collective security system.

    The statement said: The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to Moscow delivered the reply of the government of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet government on the morning of the 19th. The reply stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic, after receiving and studying the note from the Soviet government, came to the following conclusion: the Paris Agreement violates existing international agreements on the German question and seriously violates the fundamental national interests of the German people. If the London and Paris Agreements are implemented, the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis - which is essential for easing tensions in Europe - will become impossible for a long period of time. The government of the German Democratic Republic declares that it is impossible to continue to delay satisfying the urgent demand of all Germans - to reunite their homeland.

    The reply stated: The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that only a collective security system involving all European countries can promote the early reunification of Germany, eliminate the threat of war in Europe, and ease tensions in Europe.

    The reply concluded: The government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the suggestion made in the Soviet government's note of November 13 to convene a meeting on November 29 in Moscow or Paris, attended by all European countries and the United States, with the People's Republic of China participating as an observer, to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to send representatives to the meeting on November 29.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 20th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the government of the People's Republic of Albania replied to the Soviet government on the 18th, expressing its readiness to participate in the conference proposed by the Soviet Union, with representatives from European countries and the United States, and observers from the People's Republic of China, to consider the establishment of a European collective security system.

    The reply stated: The German question is the main issue in the current development of international relations. The solution to the German question is achievable. That is to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The agreements signed in London and Paris on rearming West Germany and enabling West Germany to join aggressive military blocs are direct obstacles to the solution of the German question. They will revive German militarism and seriously threaten the peace and security of the peoples of Europe.

    The reply stated: During the last World War, Albania, like many other European countries, suffered great damage from the Nazi aggressors. The Albanian people and their government are determined to do everything possible to prevent the revival of German militarism and prevent it from endangering peace again.

    The reply believes that the Soviet government's proposal to convene a Pan-European conference and establish a European collective security system is the only path towards strengthening peace and towards international cooperation and international security. The reply also stated that the government of the People's Republic of Albania believes that it is necessary for the People's Republic of China to send an observer to the meeting. It will greatly contribute to the success of the meeting.

    The reply stated: The government of the People's Republic of Albania is satisfied to accept the new suggestion of the Soviet government and thanks it for proposing the extremely important initiative to hold a meeting to consider the establishment of a European collective security system. The Albanian government announces that it is ready to participate in this meeting and will do its best to contribute to the success of the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, November 20th: The government of the Republic of Finland replied to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 19th through the Finnish Embassy in the Soviet Union, expressing its willingness to participate in the conference suggested in the Soviet note.

    The reply stated: "The Finnish government is happy to welcome every initiative and measure aimed at strengthening international peace. Therefore, it can only take a positive attitude towards the convening of the conference suggested by the Soviet government."

    The reply stated: "Regarding the suggestion put forward in the Soviet government's note, namely: to ensure peace in Europe by establishing a Pan-European security system on the basis of participation by all countries, large and small - regardless of their social and political structure - in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, the Finnish government is willing to give it favorable consideration."

    The reply stated: "Based on this point of view, the Finnish government expresses its willingness to participate in the joint conference of invited countries held on the basis described in the previous section."

    民主德国、阿尔巴尼亚和芬兰复照苏联
    表示愿意派代表参加全欧会议
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥十九日在德意志民主共和国人民议院发表政府声明，表示愿意派代表参加讨论欧洲集体安全体系的全欧会议。
    声明说：德意志民主共和国驻莫斯科大使已在十九日上午把德意志民主共和国政府的复照送交苏联政府，复照说，德意志民主共和国政府在收到并研究了苏联政府的照会后，得出了如下的结论：巴黎协定违反了现有的关于德国问题的国际协定，并严重违反了德国人民的根本民族利益。如果伦敦和巴黎协定付诸实施，在民主基础上恢复德国的统一——这对缓和欧洲紧张局势是必不可少的——就会在长时期内成为不可能。德意志民主共和国政府声明，继续迟迟不满足所有德国人的迫切要求——重新统一他们的祖国——是不可能的。
    复照说：德意志民主共和国政府认为，只有由所有欧洲国家参加的集体安全体系才能促进德国早日重归统一，消除欧洲的战争威胁，缓和欧洲的紧张局势。
    复照最后说：德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联政府十一月十三日照会中提出的建议：在十一月二十九日在莫斯科或巴黎召开一个由所有欧洲国家和美国参加、并有中华人民共和国以观察员身份参加的会议来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。德意志民主共和国政府愿意派代表参加十一月二十九日的会议。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社地拉那十九日讯：阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府十八日复照苏联政府，表示准备参加苏联建议召开的有欧洲国家和美国派代表参加、并由中华人民共和国派观察员列席的会议，以考虑建立欧洲集体安全体系问题。
    复照说：德国问题是目前国际关系演变中的主要问题。德国问题的解决是办得到的。这就是建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国。在伦敦和巴黎签订的关于重新武装西德和使西德参加侵略性的军事集团的协定，是阻碍德国问题解决的直接障碍，它们会复活德国军国主义，并且严重地威胁和平和欧洲各国人民的安全。
    复照说：在上次世界大战期间，阿尔巴尼亚同许多其他欧洲国家一样，受到纳粹侵略者的极大损害。阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的政府决心要尽一切努力来防止德国军国主义的复活，防止它再度危害和平。
    复照认为：苏联政府所提出的关于召开一个全欧会议和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议是走向加强和平及走向国际合作和国际安全的唯一道路。复照同时表示：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为，中华人民共和国派遣一位观察员参加会议是必要的。它将大大有助于会议的成功。
    复照说：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府满意地接受苏联政府的新建议，并感谢它提出了举行会议考虑建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的极为重要的倡议。阿尔巴尼亚政府宣布：它准备参加这个会议并将尽其所能为会议的成功作出贡献。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰共和国政府十九日经由芬兰驻苏联公使馆复照苏联外交部，表示愿意参加苏联照会中建议召开的会议。
    复照说：“芬兰政府乐意欢迎每一个旨在加强国际和平的倡议和措施。因此它只能对苏联政府所建议的会议的召开采取积极态度。”
    复照说：“对于苏联政府照会中所提出的建议，即：根据联合国的宗旨和原则，通过在所有大小国家——不论它们的社会和政治结构如何——参加的基础上建立全欧安全体系的办法来确保欧洲的和平，芬兰政府愿意作有利的考虑。”
    复照说：“根据这种观点，芬兰政府表示它愿意参加在前节所述的基础上举行的被邀国家的联合会议。”
