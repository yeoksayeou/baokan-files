Developing rural credit cooperatives is one of the important tasks in the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy. Since the publicity and education of the General Line began last winter, along with the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain and the development of the agricultural production cooperation movement, the rural credit cooperation movement has also developed extensively. According to recent statistics, as of the end of September, there were 70,000 credit cooperatives, 63,000 credit mutual aid groups, and 3,600 credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide. Approximately 22.0 million peasant households have participated. In some counties where credit cooperation has developed well, credit cooperatives are now present in almost every township.

However, considering the current economic situation in rural areas, the development of the credit cooperation movement is still slow. The production cooperation movement is currently in a new period of upswing, with more than 60% of peasant households participating in production mutual aid and cooperation. Supply and marketing cooperation, with the exception of a few regions, has been basically universalized. However, only less than 30% of rural villages nationwide have credit cooperative organizations. Moreover, these credit cooperative organizations are mostly concentrated in a few provinces. In the remaining large areas, approximately 90% of the villages have not yet established such organizations, and usurers continue to cruelly exploit poor peasants. This is extremely detrimental to the socialist transformation of rural areas.

In order to meet the needs of the production cooperation movement, to combat and gradually eliminate usurious exploitation in rural areas, and to continue to consolidate the stability of finance and prices, we should seize the favorable opportunity this winter and next spring to actively complete the development plan of approximately 100,000 credit cooperatives. This would raise the presence of credit cooperatives from the current 30% of the nation's townships to over 50% to 70%. At the same time, we must strengthen the leadership of the existing 70,000 plus credit cooperatives (departments) and the large number of credit mutual aid groups, actively develop deposit and loan businesses, and strive to expand the deposits and shares of credit cooperatives from the current 800 billion yuan to 2 trillion to 2.5 trillion yuan. This is in order to strengthen the financial resources for supporting agricultural production and the production cooperation movement next spring.

To do this work well, what issues must we pay attention to?

(1) Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over credit cooperation while developing the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. This is the primary key to carrying out the credit cooperation movement. This winter and next spring, we must develop 150,000 credit cooperatives and organize more than 70 million peasant households. This means that we must use socialist credit positions to replace capitalist lending positions in a vast area. Without the strong ideological and organizational leadership of the Party, such a large-scale mass movement and socialist transformation work cannot be successfully realized. However, the Party's work in rural areas is currently extremely heavy, with the central task of production mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the urgent tasks of unified purchase of grain and cotton, and production and disaster relief. Therefore, we must closely integrate the central tasks to complete the credit cooperation plan and make credit cooperation a powerful assistant in achieving the central tasks. This is an important lesson learned from various places in the development of the credit cooperation movement over the past six months. Of course, doing only this is not enough. Here, we must also solve two problems: First, under the personal leadership of the Party Committee, good credit cooperation cadre meetings should be held from top to bottom to sum up experience, deploy tasks, and promote the enthusiasm of all cadres in running cooperatives. This is an indispensable and important link in the comprehensive development of the credit cooperation movement. Second, the rural work departments of Party committees at all levels should strengthen the regular leadership of credit cooperation, with dedicated personnel responsible for regularly summarizing and exchanging experiences, solving problems in the work, and conducting in-depth inspections and promotion. Only in this way can we ensure that various places complete certain plans within a certain period of time. In some areas, the credit cooperation movement has not been carried out or has not been carried out well, mostly because there are only general calls and a lack of specific leadership. This lesson is worth remembering well.

(2) To correctly grasp the central link of the credit cooperation movement. Since the spring of this year, the credit cooperation movement has gradually moved towards a comprehensive development stage. A new situation of building cooperatives in batches has emerged in many areas. Credit cooperatives have not only begun to have a wide impact among the masses, but have also become the main form in the credit cooperation movement. Therefore, from a national perspective, actively developing the advanced form of credit cooperatives should be the central link of the current movement. However, in villages where cooperatives cannot be established immediately, credit mutual aid groups should be universally developed first, in order to occupy positions in time, cultivate backbones, and prepare conditions for the development of credit cooperatives. For credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives, due to the increasing number of rural supply and marketing tasks, it is generally appropriate not to emphasize development. Credit departments and credit groups that already have the conditions to transfer to cooperatives should be transferred to credit cooperatives in a timely manner.

Based on this spirit, each region should formulate realistic development plans that are in line with the actual local leadership experience, cadre conditions, mass base, and other specific circumstances. In areas with a good working foundation, more experience, mass demands, and backbones for building cooperatives, credit cooperatives should be rapidly and massively developed, striving to basically realize credit cooperation this winter and next spring. In areas where credit cooperation has developed rapidly but has many problems, it is necessary to consolidate and develop at the same time. Although credit cooperatives have developed less so far, but the cadre force is strong and the masses are more aware, as long as the leadership is strengthened and the backbones are trained, the area can be developed rapidly. We must strive to basically meet the requirement of one cooperative per township within one or two years. In disaster areas and poor mountainous areas, the masses face great difficulties, and usurious exploitation is still very serious. The poor peasants' demand for building cooperatives is also the most urgent. In these areas, we must especially strengthen the leadership of credit cooperation, so that credit cooperation can be universally developed in a relatively short period of time. As for the few areas that were liberated later, or have more ethnic minorities, and have weak cadre forces and work foundations, we should continue to grasp the principle of piloting credit cooperatives while universally developing credit groups.

(3) To actively and massively train cadres. Experience in various places has proven that whether the credit cooperation development plan can be smoothly realized mainly depends on the cadres running the cooperatives. Good cadres can do a good job in business management and correctly carry out credit cooperation business. Therefore, after the cooperative building plan is formulated, cadres should be actively trained. The training object should be party members and League members who have been selected by the masses, have a high prestige among the masses, and are enthusiastic about serving the masses. Currently, there are two relatively successful methods for training cadres in various places: First, the special area or county unit convenes representative meetings or cadre meetings, where leading cadres report on policies and old cooperative cadres report on experience. This can not only cultivate new cadres, but also improve old cadres. Second, old cooperatives take apprentices. Select old cooperatives that are well-run and experienced, take them as the center, delineate a guidance area, organize the masses in the area to observe and study in the old cooperatives, and let the old cooperative cadres help cultivate the backbone of cooperative building. This is a very good method of relying on the masses to educate the masses and using practical experience to cultivate cadres. From the perspective of the situation in various places, the first method is still the main one, and the second method can only be universally adopted in areas where credit cooperation has developed well.

(4) To adhere to the principle of voluntariness and correctly implement the Party's policies. One of the important reasons for the achievements of the credit cooperation movement this year is that the principle of voluntariness was adhered to in developing organizations, so it has been actively supported by the masses. However, in a few areas, there have been phenomena of coercion and commandism in the work, which have hindered the development of the movement. The reasons for the occurrence of coercion and commandism are mainly that policy publicity was insufficient when building cooperatives, the masses' ideological mobilization was not sufficient, and they were eager for quick success; at the same time, the economic difficulties of the masses were not taken care of enough, the shares were set too high, or the masses were forced to deposit money. In addition, a few cooperatives lacked a clear class viewpoint when building cooperatives, and the leadership was stolen by landlords, rich peasants, speculators, or counter-revolutionaries, which distorted the Party's policies. In order to prevent coercion and commandism and ensure the healthy development of the movement: First, we must strengthen the policy education of cadres and the masses, and repeatedly explain the basic tasks of credit cooperation and the principle of voluntary membership. Whether it is when building cooperatives or carrying out business, we must act in accordance with policies. At the same time, we should improve the masses' understanding and inspire the masses' enthusiasm for joining and running cooperatives based on the masses' ideological concerns and specific requirements through specific examples. Second, conscientiously implement the Party's class policy in rural areas. Credit cooperatives are collective capital organizations of the working masses, which serve the masses' production and the development of rural cooperativization. Only poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people can join the cooperative and enjoy the cooperative's loan assistance. Landlords, rich peasants, speculators, and counter-revolutionaries are not allowed to join the cooperative or to be loaned money to them (they may be allowed to deposit money). Third, the shares of credit cooperatives should not be set too high. In general areas, each share should be 10,000 to 30,000 yuan, and in poor areas it should be lower than general areas. One person per household can buy one share (if they voluntarily buy more shares, they can). Poor peasants who have difficulty buying shares can first pay the membership fee, and the shares can be paid in installments or deferred. Deposits must be voluntary by the masses, and no mandatory measures can be taken.

(5) Strengthen the leadership of existing cooperatives and consolidate the gained positions. Running the existing 70,000 plus cooperatives well and setting a good example among the masses can promote the widespread development of the credit cooperation movement. The central task of consolidating existing cooperatives is to enable existing cooperatives to do a good job in business management, strengthen their financial strength, and strengthen their service to the masses' production. Currently, the prestige of some cooperatives among the masses is not high, and they are not consolidated enough, mainly because the business development is not good, and they have not played a big role or have not played a role in supporting the masses' production, and usurers still exploit farmers in many ways. Therefore, consolidating existing cooperatives is also an important task this winter and next spring. Various places should appropriately organize forces to conduct a general inspection of existing cooperatives and systematically solve the problems. From the current experience in various places, the improvement of existing credit cooperation should be carried out from the following aspects:

First, in the current grain and cotton purchase movement, we must actively lead existing credit cooperatives to develop deposit business, strengthen their financial strength; and on this basis, establish a regular business with both deposits and loans, so that they can become powerful organizations for regulating rural funds and supporting the masses' production. In areas with a good working foundation, we can also gradually promote the method of credit cooperatives and production mutual aid and cooperation organizations signing deposit and loan contracts, and we can also focus on trying out the three-link contract of production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation, so that we can support agricultural production cooperation more planned and strengthen the planning of the rural economy.

Second, county and district People's Banks must take practical and effective measures to help credit cooperatives cultivate good accounting personnel and establish a reasonable expenditure system. The training methods are: 1. Special and county sub-branches hold short-term training classes, 2. County and district banks should have full-time accounting cadres who regularly go deep into credit cooperatives for specific guidance and assistance, 3. Designate credit cooperatives with strong accounting personnel to delineate guidance areas and organize accounting of surrounding cooperatives to gather regularly or irregularly to study. Now some cooperatives are already causing some suspicion among the masses and emotional unease among cooperative cadres due to financial chaos and unclear accounts, which has a great impact on the development of business. However, currently the financial accounting of credit cooperatives cannot be required too high. In addition to a few advanced cooperatives with good cadre conditions and large business development that can implement a more scientific accounting system, the accounts of general cooperatives are still advisable to use slightly improved old-style accounts.

Third, at present, a few credit cooperatives have phenomena such as impure composition of leading cadres, or undemocratic work style of leading cadres, and very unsound democratic management systems. These problems should also be solved in a timely manner.

(6) Banks at all levels have an important responsibility in leading rural credit cooperation. If the vast and scattered rural credit cooperative organizations do not have the leadership and help of the national bank in business, they cannot form a unified and powerful rural credit force, and they cannot overcome many difficulties in operation and capital. In order to adapt to the requirements of the great development of credit cooperation, local banks should, under the unified leadership of the Party, list the development of credit cooperation as a regular central task in rural financial work; and should strengthen the organizations and cadres specializing in credit cooperation work, from cultivating cooperative cadres, leading business development, improving the financial accounting system, and capital adjustment and support, to give credit cooperative organizations strong leadership and assistance.

Universally realizing rural credit cooperation, completely eliminating usurious exploitation in rural areas, and mobilizing the huge potential funds in rural areas to serve the completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture is the cause of our entire Party, the common task of all working farmers, and the glorious historical mission of all our rural financial workers. We should all actively contribute our strength in this great cause, strive to overcome difficulties, do our work well, and strive to victoriously complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    发展农村信用合作应注意的几个问题
    中国人民银行农村金融局副局长  王沛霖
    发展农村信用合作，是对小农经济实行社会主义改造的重要工作之一。自从去冬开始总路线的宣传教育，实行粮食统购统销和开展农业生产合作运动以来，农村信用合作运动也有了广泛的发展。据最近统计，全国到九月底止已有信用社七万个、信用互助组六万三千个、供销社的信用部三千六百个。参加的农户约有二千二百余万户。有些信用合作发展较好的县，现在已经接近乡乡有社了。
    但从今天农村的经济情况看来，信用合作运动的发展还是迟缓的。目前生产合作运动正处在新的高涨时期，参加生产互助合作的农户已达到总农户的百分之六十以上；供销合作除少数地区外，基本上已经普遍化了；但有信用合作组织的乡村还不到全国乡村总数的百分之三十，同时这些信用合作组织又大都集中在少数几个省内，其余大部分地区，大约都还有百分之九十左右的乡村没有建立，高利贷者还在残酷地剥削贫苦农民。这对农村的社会主义改造是极不利的。
    为了适应生产合作运动的需要，为了打击和逐步消灭农村的高利贷剥削以及为了继续巩固金融物价的稳定，极应抓紧今冬明春有利时机，积极完成十万个左右信用社的发展计划，使信用社的阵地从现在占全国乡数的百分之三十提高到百分之五十以上至百分之七十；同时要加强对现有的七万多个社
  （部）和大量信用互助组的领导，积极开展存款放款业务，争取使信用社的存款和股金从现有的八千亿元扩大到两万亿元至两万五千亿元，以壮大明春扶植农业生产和支持生产合作运动的资金力量。
    为了作好这个工作，必须注意那些问题呢？
      （一）各级党委在发展农业生产互助合作运动中，同时加强对信用合作的领导，这是开展信用合作运动的首要关键。今冬明春要发展到十五万个信用社，组织起七千万户以上的农民。这就是说，要在广大的地区内用社会主义的信贷阵地去代替资本主义的借贷阵地。这样一个巨大规模的群众运动和社会主义改造工作，没有党在思想上和组织上的坚强领导，是不可能胜利实现的。但目前党在农村的工作是异常繁重的，除了生产互助合作的中心任务外，还有紧张的粮棉统购任务和生产救灾任务，因此，必须紧紧结合中心工作来完成信用合作计划，并使信用合作成为实现中心工作的一个有力助手。这是半年来各地在发展信用合作运动中得到的一个重要经验。当然，仅仅这样做还是很不够的，这里还必须解决两个问题：第一，要在党委亲自领导下自上而下地开好信用合作干部会议，总结经验，布置任务，发扬全体干部的办社积极性，这是全面开展信用合作运动一个不可缺少的重要环节；第二，各级党委的农村工作部要加强对信用合作的经常领导，要有专人负责，经常总结交流经验，解决工作中的问题，并深入检查推动。这样才能保证各地在一定时期内完成一定的计划。有些地区信用合作运动没有开展起来或开展的不好，大都是由于只有一般号召，缺乏具体领导。这个教训是值得很好记取的。
      （二）要正确掌握信用合作运动的中心环节。今年春天以来，信用合作运动已逐步走向全面开展阶段。在许多地区出现了成批建社的新形势。信用合作社不仅在群众中已开始有了广泛的影响，而且已成为信用合作运动中的主要形式。因此，从全国范围来说，积极发展高级形式的信用社应是当前运动的中心环节。但在不能马上建社的乡村，首先应普遍发展信用互助组，以便及时占领阵地，培养骨干，为发展信用社准备条件。对于供销社的信用部，由于农村供销任务日益繁重，一般以不强调发展为宜。现在有不少信用部和信用小组已经具备了转社条件的，应该及时转成信用社。
    根据这一精神，各个地区应按照当地领导经验，干部条件，群众基础等具体情况，因地制宜地制定切合实际的发展计划。在工作基础较好，经验较多，群众有要求，建社有骨干的地区，应迅速地大量地发展信用社，争取在今冬明春基本上实现信用合作化。在信用合作发展较快，但存在问题较多的地区，就须要一面巩固一面发展。信用社目前虽然发展较少，但干部力量强，群众觉悟较高，只要加强了领导，训练好骨干，就可以迅速发展的地区，就要争取在一两年内基本上达到一乡一社的要求。灾区和贫瘠山区，群众困难大，高利贷剥削还很严重，贫苦农民的建社要求也最迫切。这些地区，必须特别加强对信用合作的领导，使信用合作能够在一个较短时间内普遍发展起来。至于少数解放较晚，或民族较多，干部力量和工作基础都较薄弱的地区，应继续掌握一面试办信用社，一面普遍发展信用组的方针。
    （三）要积极大量地训练干部。各地的经验证明，信用合作发展计划能否顺利实现，主要决定于办社干部。干部好就能做好经营管理工作和正确开展信用合作业务。因此，建社计划制定以后，就要积极训练干部。训练的对象应该是经过群众选拔，在群众中有较高威信，热心为群众服务的党、团员积极分子。目前各地训练干部的方法，比较成功的有两种：第一，是以专区或县为单位，召开代表会或干部会，由领导干部报告政策，由老社干部报告经验。这就既可培养新干部，也可提高老干部。第二，由老社带徒弟。选择办得好、经验多的老社，以之为中心，划定辅导区，组织区内群众到老社观摩，并由老社干部帮助培养建社骨干。这是
  一种依靠群众教育群众，用实际经验来培养干部的很好方法。从各地情况看，目前第一种方法还是主要的，第二种方法只在信用合作发展较好的地区，才可以普遍采用。
      （四）要坚持自愿原则，正确执行党的政策。今年信用合作运动取得成绩的重要原因之一，是在发展组织时坚持了自愿原则，所以得到了群众的积极拥护。但也有少数地区在工作中曾经发生过强迫命令现象，使运动的发展受到了阻碍。发生强迫命令的原因主要是在建社时政策宣传不够，群众思想发动不充分，急于求成；同时对群众经济困难照顾不够，股金定的过高，或强制群众存款。还有少数社在建社时阶级观点不明确，被地主、富农、投机商人或反革命分子盗取了领导权，使党的政策被歪曲。为了防止发生强迫命令，保证运动的健康发展：第一，要加强对干部和群众的政策教育，反复说明信用合作的基本任务和入社自愿原则。不论在建社时或开展业务时，必须按照政策办事，同时，应根据群众的思想顾虑和具体要求，通过具体事例来提高群众认识，启发群众的入社和办社积极性。第二，认真贯彻党在农村的阶级政策。信用合作社是劳动群众的集体资金组织，是为群众生产服务，为发展农村合作化服务的，只有贫农、中农和其他劳动人民才能入社和享受社的贷款扶助。地主、富农、投机商人和反革命分子一律不准入社，也不许贷款给他们（可允许他们存款）。第三，信用社的股金不宜定得太高，一般地区每股应以一万元到三万元为宜，贫瘠地区应低于一般地区。一户有一人入一股即可（如自愿多入股者亦可）。贫农入股困难的，可先缴入社费，股金分期或缓期缴纳。存款
  一定要群众自愿，不能采取任何强制办法。
      （五）加强现有社的领导，巩固既得阵地。办好现有的七万多个社，在群众中做好榜样，就可以推动信用合作运动广泛开展。巩固现有社的中心工作，是要使现有社做好经营管理工作，壮大资金力量，和加强为群众生产服务。目前有些社在群众中的威信不高，不够巩固，主要是由于业务发展不好，在扶植群众生产中起的作用不大或没有起到作用，高利贷者仍然多方盘剥农民。所以巩固现有社也是今冬明春一项重要工作。各地都应适当组织力量对现有社普遍进行一次检查，把问题系统地加以解决。从目前各地经验来看，提高现有信用合作应从以下几个方面进行：
    第一，要在目前的粮、棉收购运动中，积极领导现有信用社开展存款业务，壮大资金力量；并在这一基础上建立起有存有贷的经常业务，使它们成为调剂农村资金，扶助群众生产的有力组织。在工作基础较好的地区，还可以逐步推广信用社和生产互助合作组织的订立存贷合同的办法，也可以重点试行生产合作、供销合作、信用合作三大业务的三连环合同，以便能够更有计划的支持农业生产合作化和加强农村经济的计划性。
    第二，县、区人民银行，要采取切实有效的办法，帮助信用社培养好会计人员，建立起合理的开支制度。培养的方法：一、专、县支行召开短期训练班，二、县区银行应有专职会计干部，经常深入信用社具体指导帮助，三、指定会计人员较强的信用社划定辅导区，组织周围社的会计定期或不定期的集中研究学习。现在有些社因财务混乱，账目不清，已开始引起部分群众的怀疑和社干部情绪不安，对开展业务影响很大。但目前对信用社的财务会计还不能要求太高，除少数干部条件好，业务开展大的先进社可以推行比较科学的会计制度以外，一般社的账目，还是以运用略加改良的旧式账为宜。
    第三，目前有少数信用社存在着领导干部成份不纯，或领导干部作风不民主，民主管理制度很不健全等现象。这些问题也应及时加以解决。
      （六）各级银行在领导农村信用合作工作中，负有重要责任。广大的分散的农村信用合作组织，如果在业务上没有国家银行的领导帮助，就不能形成统一的强大的农村信贷力量，就不能克服经营方面和资金方面的许多困难。为了适应信用合作大发展的要求，各地银行都应在党的统一领导下，把发展信用合作列为农村金融工作中经常的中心任务之
  一；并应加强专管信用合作工作的机构和干部，从培养办社骨干，领导开展业务，健全财务会计制度和资金调剂支持等方面，给信用合作组织以大力领导和帮助。
    普遍实现农村信用合作化，彻底消灭农村的高利贷剥削，把农村的巨大潜在资金动员起来为完成农业社会主义改造而服务，这是我们全党的事业，全体劳动农民的共同任务，也是我们全体农村金融工作者光荣的历史使命。我们都应当在这一伟大的事业中积极的贡献出自己的力量，努力克服困难，做好工作，为胜利的完成党所交给我们的任务而奋斗。
