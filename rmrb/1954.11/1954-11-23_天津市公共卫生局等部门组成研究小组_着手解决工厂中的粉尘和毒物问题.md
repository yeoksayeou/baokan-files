The Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, and other departments recently jointly formed a dust and toxin investigation research group. They investigated 103 factories in Tianjin and, based on existing experience, began to address dust and toxin problems that affect workers' health.

　　In the past, when the Tianjin Bicycle Factory used grinding wheels to polish bicycle frames and other parts, a lot of iron filings were emitted, which easily caused sinusitis and tracheitis in workers. Recently, workers in the polishing workshop designed a grinding wheel dust collector with a hood that has a suction effect on the grinding wheel, so the iron filings are sucked and concentrated in a designated place. In the past, the rubber scraping workshop of the Tianjin Rubber Factory No. 3 had a strong gasoline smell in the air, which caused gasoline poisoning and indigestion and other diseases in workers. Worker Wang Jiaqi and technicians designed a gasoline recovery device that recovers the gas after the gasoline evaporates and can be re-condensed into gasoline. This not only ensures fresh air in the workshop, but also recovers a quarter of the original gasoline used, saving 7,650 kilograms of gasoline per year. In the past, the vulcanized cyan workshop of the Tianjin Dyestuff Factory was filled with a lot of dyestuff powder, which irritated the workers' eyes and respiratory organs. The employees installed a filter-type bag dust collector to remove the dust from the workshop.

　　The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions have summarized these effective methods of preventing dust and toxins and are preparing to promote them in factories and enterprises with the same industry or similar production characteristics throughout the city.

    天津市公共卫生局等部门组成研究小组
    着手解决工厂中的粉尘和毒物问题
    天津市人民政府公共卫生局、劳动局、天津市工会联合会等部门，最近联合组成粉尘、毒物调查研究小组，调查了天津市一百零三个工厂，并根据已有的经验着手解决影响工人健康的粉尘和毒物问题。
    天津自行车厂过去用砂轮磨自行车架和其他零件的时候，很多铁末散发出来，易引起工人的鼻窦炎和气管炎。最近，磨光车间的工人设计出一种砂轮吸尘器，在砂轮上安上有抽风作用的罩，铁末便被吸引集中到指定的地方。天津橡胶三厂的刮胶车间，过去空气中有浓厚的汽油味，曾引起工人的汽油中毒和消化不良等疾病。工人王嘉祺和技术人员设计出一种汽油回收的装置，把汽油挥发后的气体收回，并能再凝结成汽油。不仅保证了车间的空气新鲜，而且可以收回原用汽油的四分之一，每年可收回汽油七千六百五十公斤。天津染料厂的硫化青车间，过去飞扬着很多的染料末，刺激工人的眼睛和呼吸器官。职工们装置了一种过滤式布袋吸尘器，吸去了车间的粉尘。
    天津市人民政府公共卫生局和劳动局、天津市工会联合会已把这些防止粉尘、毒物的有效办法加以总结，准备在全市行业相同或生产性质相同的工厂企业中推广。　　（新华社）
