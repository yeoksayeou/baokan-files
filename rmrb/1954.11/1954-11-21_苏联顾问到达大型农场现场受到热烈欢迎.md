Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—Fourteen Soviet advisors, including Nikolenko, the chief advisor and director of the farm; Kruglikov, chief agricultural technician; Gerasimov, chief mechanical engineer; and Baryshnikov, chief accountant, arrived by train on the 19th at Fulitun, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, the temporary location of the preparatory office for the large state-owned grain farm. Stepanenko, a Soviet advisor from our Ministry of Agriculture and state farm management expert, also arrived. Hundreds of local farmers braved the wind and snow to warmly welcome the Soviet advisors at the Fulitun station. The heads of the Party and government of Jixian County also rushed from the county seat to welcome them. After a short rest in Fulitun, the Soviet advisors traveled by car to Xinglong Town, near the site of the large farm, and will then proceed to observe the site.

Of the thirty-five Soviet experts serving as advisors to the large farm, twenty-one are currently staying in Harbin. They are preparing to train our cadres and technicians who will be responsible for the management of the large farm.
