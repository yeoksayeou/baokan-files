    The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia broke the chains of political and national oppression, cleared the obstacles to friendship and fraternal cooperation among all ethnic groups, and laid the foundation for the formation of new socialist nations.

    In the early days of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet government, in its "Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia," declared that there should be no ruling or subordinate nations in the Soviet state, and that all nations should enjoy the right to national self-determination up to the point of national separation.

    It has been thirty-seven years since the establishment of the Soviet regime. Under the Soviet system, formerly oppressed nations have embarked on the road to national prosperity and have made remarkable achievements in developing and consolidating their own state systems, economies, and cultures, thereby greatly enhancing the power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    Based on the policy of equality, friendship, and sincere mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, the Soviet regime has united all Soviet nations into a unified and unbreakable big family. The friendship of all ethnic groups is a great achievement of historical significance and one of the sources of strength and power of the Soviet system. The friendship that arose and was consolidated among all ethnic groups in the common struggle to build socialism in the Soviet Union has withstood all tests and has been further tempered in the flames of the Great Patriotic War. Now, the unbreakable friendship between all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is further developing and consolidating in the common peaceful labor to build a communist society in the Soviet state.

    The combination of the national interests of all ethnic groups and the common and vital interests of all working people in the Soviet state is an important feature of Soviet state-building. The equality of all socialist nations and ethnic minorities is not only enshrined in the Soviet Constitution but also guaranteed by the entire socialist economic system of the Soviet Union.

    Within the fraternal alliance of socialist nations, the powerful strength of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union has developed. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the national economy of the Soviet republics and ethnic autonomous regions has been fundamentally changed. As a result of the thorough implementation of Lenin and Stalin's national policy and the implementation of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, all national republics have ended their previous backwardness and have become prosperous industrial and collectivized agricultural countries. For example, in Kazakhstan, the proportion of industry in the national economy was 6.3 percent in 1920, while during the pre-war Five-Year Plans it had risen to 60 percent. In Uzbekistan, industrial output increased fiftyfold and electricity production increased two hundred and twenty-twofold between 1924 and 1953. The Ukrainian people have made great achievements: in the years after the war, more than 3,000 industrial enterprises were restored and rebuilt in Ukraine, and many new industrial sectors were established, such as the gas industry and brown coal mining. Now, the "Zaporozhstal" plant alone produces more pig iron in one year than all the metallurgical plants in Ukraine produced on the eve of World War I.

    In the Soviet republics, socialist agriculture is developing steadily.

    Even the ethnic minorities living in remote border areas that were extremely backward before the revolution have prospered economically with the help of their Soviet compatriots, greatly improved their material well-being and cultural level, and achieved genuine equality with other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.

    In resolving the national question, the Communist Party and the Soviet government proceeded from the principle of maximizing the satisfaction of the growing material and cultural needs of the entire Soviet society and vigorously developing the productive forces. This concern for the welfare of the working people has had remarkable results. On the basis of the common upsurge of the economy of the entire Soviet Union and the economy of each national republic, the living standards of the working people in the Soviet republics are constantly improving. In the Soviet republics, exploitation of man by man and unemployment have long been eradicated. Every citizen has broad opportunities to exert his strength and use his knowledge and talents. The wages of workers and staff are constantly increasing, and the income of farmers is also increasing day by day. Since World War II, the Soviet Union has reduced the prices of industrial products and food seven times.

    The high level of cultural development is an important characteristic of the Soviet nation. A genuine cultural revolution has been completed in the Soviet state. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, forty-eight ethnic groups that were previously considered very backward have created their own written languages.

    Fundamental changes have also taken place in national education and culture during the Soviet era. This can be clearly illustrated by simply citing some examples from the Soviet republics of Central Asia.

    Before the revolution, only 0.11 percent of the population in Kazakhstan could read and write, but now the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic has long become a completely literate republic. There are about 900 schools in the country, and more than one million school-age children are attending school. In the current territory of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, according to the 1897 census, the number of literate people among the local residents accounted for only 0.7 percent. Now, there are more than 1,200 schools, with 11,000 teachers teaching in them. In Tajikistan, the number of literate people among the residents was previously only 4 percent. Now, there is not a single illiterate person in the republic. There are nearly 3,000 schools. Among the Kyrgyz people of Central Asia, the proportion of literate people was even lower, accounting for only 0.6 percent. Now, there are about 1,600 schools, 10 institutions of higher learning, and 26 secondary technical schools established in the Kyrgyz Republic. The scale of development of higher education in the union republics can also be judged from the following facts. Before the revolution, there was not a single institution of higher learning in Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. However, now, there are a total of about 140 institutions of higher learning in these republics, with about 100,000 students studying in them.

    In the national republics, a new Soviet intelligentsia has grown up. A large number of scientists, social activists, engineers, agronomists, doctors, teachers, and artists have been trained in the process of socialist construction. These cadres have grown up and been trained under the Soviet system, free from the shackles of capitalist exploitation and free from racial, national, and all other forms of oppression.

    Soviet culture, with its national form and socialist content, is developing by leaps and bounds.

    Many ethnic groups that did not even have written languages before the revolution have now created their own national literature. The names of the Kazakh Jambyl, the Tajik Aini, the Dagestani Stalsky, and many other writers are famous not only throughout the Soviet Union but also abroad.

    Soviet science is also booming. Many academies of sciences have been established in the union republics, and they are conducting fruitful research in all fields of knowledge.

    Patriotism and internationalism are the characteristics of the new spiritual face of the socialist nation. The Soviet people love their motherland, but at the same time, they never take a contemptuous attitude towards other ethnic groups. They respect the rights and independence of all ethnic groups, large and small. These principles have been vividly embodied in the mutual assistance and cooperation shown by the Soviet people of all ethnic groups in the years of socialist construction and in the years of defending the motherland from enemy aggression. Now, the Soviet working people participating in communist construction have new and vivid manifestations of vigorous Soviet patriotism every day. This clearly shows the unbreakable and increasingly consolidated friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet people, nurtured by the spirit of proletarian internationalism, always respect the rights and independence of foreign ethnic groups, and are always willing to live in peace and friendship with all nations. This is the inexhaustible source of the increasingly close and consolidated ties between the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving people in the world.

    The multi-ethnic Soviet state has become a fortress of friendship and fraternity among all ethnic groups and a standard-bearer of world peace.

    十月革命给俄国各族人民开辟了走向民族复兴的道路
    格·拉让诺夫
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在俄国打断了政治和民族压迫的锁链，扫清了各族人民的友谊和兄弟般合作的障碍，为社会主义的新的民族的形成奠立了基础。
    在苏维埃政权成立的初期，苏维埃政府在“俄国各族人民权利宣言”中就曾经宣布说：在苏维埃国家中不应有统治的和隶属的民族，所有民族都享有民族自决直到民族分立的权利。
    苏维埃政权自从成立以来已有三十七年了。在苏维埃制度下，从前被压迫的民族已经走上了民族繁荣的道路，在发展和巩固自己的国家制度、经济和文化各方面都获得了显著成就，从而大大地增强了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的威力。
    苏维埃政权在各族人民平等、友爱和真诚互助的政策的基础上，已经把所有苏维埃民族团结在统一的、牢不可破的大家庭里了。各族人民的友谊是具有历史意义的巨大成果，是苏维埃制度的力量和威力底源泉之一。在各族人民为了在苏联建成社会主义的共同斗争中产生和巩固起来的友谊经历了一切考验，并且在伟大卫国战争的火焰中受到更大的锻炼。现在，苏联各族人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，在为了在苏维埃国家内建成共产主义社会而进行的共同和平劳动中更进一步地发展和巩固起来了。
    各族人民的民族利益和苏维埃国家所有劳动人民的共同的切身利益的结合，是苏联进行国家建设的重要特点。所有社会主义的民族和少数民族的平等不仅已在苏联宪法中被固定起来，而且获得了苏联整个社会主义经济制度的保证。
    在社会主义的民族的兄弟联盟内，苏联各族人民的强大力量已经发展起来。自从苏维埃政权成立以来，根本改变了苏联各共和国和各民族州的国民经济。由于彻底实行了列宁、斯大林的民族政策和实行了国家工业化、农业集体化的结果，所有各民族共和国都已终结了先前的落后现象，变成了繁荣的工业和集体化农业的国家。例如，在哈萨克斯坦，国民经济中工业的比重在一九二○年为百分之六点三，而在战前几个五年计划期间则已经提高到百分之六十。在乌兹别克斯坦，从一九二四年到一九五三年之间，工业产量增加到五十倍，电力生产增加到二百二十二倍。乌克兰人民获得了巨大成就：战后几年来，在乌克兰恢复和重建了三千多个工业企业，此外还建立了许多新的工业部门，如瓦斯工业、褐煤开采业等。现在，只是“札坡罗什钢铁”厂一处，一年所生产的铣铁就比第一次世界大战前夜乌克兰所有冶金工厂生产的铣铁还多。
    在苏维埃各共和国内，社会主义的农业在稳固地发展着。
    甚至连居住在革命以前极端落后的辽远边区的少数民族，由于苏维埃国家同胞的帮助已在经济上繁荣起来，大大地提高了自己的物质福利和文化水平，达到了和苏联其他民族真正平等的地位。
    在解决民族问题当中，共产党和苏维埃政府是从为了最大限度地满足整个苏维埃社会日益增长的物质和文化的需要以及大力发展生产力的原则出发的。对劳动人民福利的这种关怀已有了显著的成果。在整个苏联的经济和每一个民族共和国的经济共同高涨的基础上，苏联各共和国劳动人民的生活水平不断地提高。在苏维埃各共和国内，人剥削人的现象和失业现象早已经绝迹了。每个公民都有发挥自己力量、运用自己的知识和才能的广泛机会。工人和职员的工资在不断地提高，同时农民的收入也在日益增加。在第二次世界大战以后，苏联已把工业品和食品的价格减低了七次。
    文化发展的高度水平是苏维埃民族一个重要的特点。在苏维埃国家内已完成了真正的文化革命。自从苏维埃政权成立以来，从前被认为是很落后的四十八个民族已经创造了自己的文字。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，国民教育和文化方面也发生了根本的变化。只要举出中亚细亚苏维埃共和国的一些例子，便可以明显地说明这点。
    革命前，在哈萨克斯坦会读会写的人仅占居民的千分之一点一，而现在，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国早已成为一个完全有文化的共和国了。在该国内约有九百所学校，全部学龄儿童一百多万名都在上学。在现在的土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国境内，根据一八九七年的人口登记来看，在本地居民中，识字的人数仅占百分之零点七，现在，已有一千二百多所学校，有一万一千名教师在其中授课。在塔吉克斯坦，以前居民中识字的人数不过百分之四，现在，在该共和国内已经没有一个文盲了。将近有三千所学校之多。在中亚细亚吉尔吉斯人民中，以前识字人数的比例更低，仅占百分之零点六。现在，吉尔吉斯共和国内设立的学校约达一千六百所，高等学校十所，中等技术专科学校二十六所。从下列的事实中也可以判断出加盟共和国内高等教育的发展规模。革命前在白俄罗斯、亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆、土库曼、乌兹别克斯坦、塔吉克斯坦和哈萨克斯坦连一所高等学校都没有，然而，现在，在这些共和国内总共已有了大约一百四十所高等学校，在其中学习的学生约有十万名。
    在各民族共和国内，新的苏维埃知识分子已经成长起来了。在社会主义建设的过程中培养出了大批的科学家、社会活动家、工程师、农学家、医师、教师和艺术家。这些干部都是在没有资本主义剥削的束缚和没有种族和民族以及其他一切压迫的苏维埃制度的条件下成长和培养起来的。
    民族形式、社会主义内容的苏维埃文化正在飞跃地发展中。
    许多在革命前连文字都没有的民族现在已经创建了自己的民族文学。哈萨克人江布尔、塔吉克人艾尼和达格斯坦人斯塔尔斯基及许多其他作家的名字，不仅在全苏联，而且在国外也是驰名的。
    苏维埃的科学也在蓬勃地发展着。各加盟共和国已设立了许多科学院，它们正对一切的知识领域进行有成效的研究。
    爱国主义和国际主义是社会主义民族新的精神面貌的特征。苏维埃人民热爱自己的祖国，同时他们也绝不会对其他民族采取轻视的态度。他们尊重一切大小民族的权利和独立。这些原则已在苏维埃各族人民在社会主义建设的年月中和在保卫祖国免遭敌人侵略的年月中所表现的互助合作之中活生生地体现了出来。现在，参加共产主义建设的苏联劳动人民每天都有生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义的新的鲜明的表现。在这上面确切地表明着苏联各族人民牢不可破的和日益巩固的友谊。
    由无产阶级国际主义精神培养出来的苏联人民永远尊重外国各族人民的权利和独立，并且永远愿意和一切民族生活在和平和友谊之中，这就是苏联和世界爱好自由的一切人民日益密切和巩固的联系的无穷尽的源泉。
    多民族的苏维埃国家已成为各族人民亲睦友爱的堡垒和全世界和平的旗手。
