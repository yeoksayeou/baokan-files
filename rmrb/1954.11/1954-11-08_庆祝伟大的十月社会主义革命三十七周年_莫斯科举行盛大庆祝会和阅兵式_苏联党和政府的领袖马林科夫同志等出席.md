　　The Bolshoi Theatre was adorned in festive attire.

The theater's hall and stage were magnificently decorated. In the center of the stage hung portraits of Lenin and Stalin, surrounded by flags.

　　Saburov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, delivered a report on the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. His report was punctuated by applause on more than one occasion.

　　A grand festive artistic performance, featuring the Soviet Union's finest artists, followed the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: According to TASS, a grand military parade was held on Red Square in Moscow on November 7th to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

　　On this day, a solemn festive atmosphere enveloped Red Square. The facade of the State Historical Museum was adorned with large gilded characters: "1917" and "1954." The buildings opposite the Kremlin were decorated with bright red flags, green wreaths, giant portraits of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin, and golden slogans:
　　"Forward to the Victory of Communism!"

　　The stands were filled with spectators, including representatives of the working people of Moscow, scientists, writers, actors, collective farm members from the Moscow suburbs, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and members of foreign delegations visiting Moscow.

　　Shortly before ten o'clock in the morning, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government ascended the reviewing stand atop the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum to thunderous applause.

　　At ten o'clock sharp, the military parade commenced. The Minister of Defense of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, rode out of the Spassky Tower gate in an open-top car. Bulganin inspected the Moscow garrison and congratulated them on the anniversary of the October Revolution. The troops responded with a resounding "Hurrah!"

　　After the inspection, Bulganin ascended the reviewing stand and delivered a speech (full text on page four).

　　As Bulganin concluded his speech, a thunderous artillery salute and the solemn Soviet national anthem resounded across Red Square.

　　The march-past began. Leading the way were young drummers. Next, a combined formation of students from the Frunze Military Academy, the Lenin Military-Political Academy, the Academy of Tank and Mechanized Forces, the Military Engineering Academy, and the Air Force Academy, marched across the square bearing banners. Behind them followed students from the military school named after the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. The Soviet border troops, vigilantly guarding the country's frontiers, then passed through the square. Guests in the stands applauded warmly as the youngest participants in the parade—students from the Suvorov Military School in Kalinin and the Nakhimov Naval School in Leningrad—marched past. Spectators also enthusiastically greeted the Kalinin Taman Guards Division, which had repeatedly distinguished itself in the Great Patriotic War.

　　Artillery units then proceeded across Red Square. The artillery units included many large-caliber anti-aircraft guns, rocket launchers, tractors towing heavy artillery, and some cannons never before seen in past parades.

　　The parade on Red Square demonstrated the new achievements of the Soviet Army in improving its combat skills and mastering new technologies and weaponry. The Soviet armed forces now possess everything necessary to fulfill their noble mission—to defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people.

　　Following the military parade, the festive parade of the working people of Moscow began.
