    Jiangxi Province Actively Helps Returning Disaster Victims Rebuild Their Homes
    Anhui Province's Wuhu Special District Disaster-Stricken Masses Launch Sideline Production
    In the Jiangxi Province's areas along the river and around the lakes, governments at all levels are actively helping returning disaster victims rebuild their homes and restore production. Since October, the river and lake floods have receded rapidly, and disaster victims have been returning to their hometowns one after another. To solve the various difficulties faced by returning disaster victims, the people's government has promptly distributed living expenses and house repair subsidies. Jiujiang County promptly issued 411.8 million yuan in housing repair subsidies, helping 1,456 disaster-stricken households build 2,483 thatched huts. In the disaster areas of Yugan County, houses are being built collectively by agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and natural villages. This saves labor, materials, and time, and also frees up a lot of land for expanding vegetable gardens. After rebuilding their homes, the disaster victims are widely developing sideline production according to local conditions. Farmers in the Poyang Lake area, under the slogan of "Only allow the water to recede, don't let the fish run away," are actively fishing, and now they can produce more than 200,000 jin of fresh fish every day. The Jiangxi Provincial Aquatic Products Company has set up purchasing stations in various counties to facilitate farmers' fish sales, and various fishery production cooperatives have also promptly supplied disaster-stricken farmers with the means of production for fishing. The coordinated cooperation of these departments has further encouraged the confidence of disaster-stricken farmers in self-reliance through production. (Our correspondent station in Jiangxi)

    In order to lead the masses to carry out production for self-relief and overcome the famine from multiple aspects, the Party and government organs in Wuhu Special District, Anhui Province, have launched sideline production in accordance with local conditions and without affecting agricultural production. According to preliminary estimates, the entire region has increased its income by more than 130 million yuan through sideline production items such as fishing, digging coal, and crushing stones. At present, various places are still actively organizing and deploying labor to further develop various sideline productions.
    When developing sideline production, all localities have implemented the policy of closely focusing on agricultural production. Jin Yi Township in Dangtu County's quarrying area has adopted a method of combining drainage and replanting with fishing sideline production. Eighty-one disaster-stricken households drained 36 mu of waterlogged fields to a depth of one to two chi in two days and caught more than 1,500 jin of fish and shrimp. This both expanded the autumn planting area and increased sideline income. (Ye Zhenya)

    江西省积极帮助回乡灾民重建家园
    安徽省芜湖专区受灾群众展开副业生产
    江西省沿江滨湖地区，各级人民政府积极帮助回乡灾民重建家园，恢复生产。十月份以来，江、湖洪水迅速退落，灾民已陆续回乡，为了解决回乡灾民各方面的困难，人民政府及时发放了生活、房屋修建补助费。九江县及时发出修建房屋补助费四亿一千一百八十万元，帮助了一千四百五十六户灾民，搭盖了茅屋二千四百八十三栋。在余干县灾区里，以农业生产合作社、互助组、自然村为单位集体修建房屋，这样省工、省料、省时间，同时还空出了很多土地扩种菜园。灾民重建家园后，因地制宜地广泛开展了副业生产。鄱阳湖地区农民，在“只准水退，不许鱼跑”的口号下，积极捕鱼，现在每天可产鲜鱼二十余万斤。江西省水产公司为便利农民售鱼，在各县设立了收购站，各渔业生产合作社也及时供应灾区农民捕鱼的生产资料，这些部门的协同配合，更鼓舞了灾区农民生产自救的信心。               （本报江西记者站）

    安徽省芜湖专区党政机关为了从多方面领导群众进行生产自救，度过灾荒，在不影响农业生产的前提下根据地区情况因地制宜地开展了副业生产。据初步估算全区通过捕鱼、挖土煤、砸石子等项副业生产，已增加收入一亿三千多万元。现在各地还在积极组织和调配劳力，进一步开展各种副业生产。
    在开展副业生产时，各地都贯彻了紧密围绕农业生产的方针，当涂县采石区金义乡采取排涝补种与捕鱼副业相结合的办法，八十一户灾民两天排出一尺至二尺深的积水田三十六亩，捕捉鱼虾一千五百多斤，这样既扩大了秋种面积又增加了副业收入。  （叶镇亚）
