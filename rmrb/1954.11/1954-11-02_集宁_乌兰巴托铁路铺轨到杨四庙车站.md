Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 1st: The railway paving project on the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway within China will be completed this year. The track has now been laid to Yangsimiao Station, 233 kilometers from Jining. It can be laid to Eren Station, near the Chinese border, within this year.

All the staff of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for the construction of this railway, held an engineering meeting in early October to determine specific measures for winter construction, in order to strive to complete 50 percent of the annual workload in the fourth quarter. The workers of the track-laying engineering team proposed to overcome the severe winter on the grassland and lay the rails to Eren. Recently, they have increased the speed of daily track laying from more than two kilometers to more than three kilometers. In order to ensure the planned progress and quality of winter construction, some of the manual track-laying work will be replaced by mechanical construction; relevant units have also signed liaison contracts. The Party Committee, administration, and trade union of the Third Engineering Bureau have jointly organized a track-laying command post, and are now sending cadres to go deep into the site to provide specific assistance.

    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路铺轨到杨四庙车站
    【新华社呼和浩特一日电】集宁—乌兰巴托铁路在我国境内的铺轨工程今年将全部完工。现在已经铺轨到距集宁二百三十三公里的杨四庙车站。年内可以铺到靠近我国边境的二连车站。
    负责修建这段铁路的铁道部第三工程局的全体职工，为了争取在第四季度内完成占全年工程量百分之五十的工程任务，十月初就曾召开工程会议，确定了今年冬季施工的具体措施。钉道工程队的职工们，提出要战胜草原上的寒冬，把钢轨铺到二连去。最近他们已把每天铺轨的速度由两公里多提高到三公里以上。为了保证冬季施工的计划进度和工程质量，一部分原来用手工操作的钉道工作，将改用机械施工；有关单位并签订了联系合同。中共第三工程局党委会和行政、工会等联合组织了铺轨指挥所，现在正派出干部分别深入到现场去进行具体帮助。
