State-owned Lutai Farm responded to the state's call to increase oil crop production this spring. Under the planting principles of not violating the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and field crop rotation, it planted more than 8,600 mu of soybeans and achieved a widespread bumper harvest, creating an advanced example of sowing oil crops on saline-alkali land in Bohai Bay.

The planting of soybeans at Lutai Farm, from plowing and sowing to harvesting, was all done by machine. At the same time, the workers carefully managed the crops, resulting in a yield of 180 jin per mu, exceeding the planned yield by more than 20 percent. The farm is now turning over millions of jin of newly harvested soybeans to the state treasury.

    国营芦台农场大豆丰收
    国营芦台农场今春响应了国家增产油料作物的号召，在不违背农牧结合和大田轮作的种植原则下，种植大豆八千六百余亩，获得普遍丰收，创造了在渤海湾盐碱地上播种油料作物的先进范例。
    芦台农场大豆的种植，从耕、播到收割，全部使用机器操作，同时职工们细心管理，因而使每亩产量达到一百八十斤，超过计划产量百分之二十以上。现在该农场正将新收的数百万斤大豆上缴国库。
