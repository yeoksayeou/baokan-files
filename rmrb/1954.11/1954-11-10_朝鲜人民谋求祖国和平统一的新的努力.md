    New Efforts by the Korean People to Seek Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
    Li Gao
    The unresolved nature of the Korean question is increasingly arousing concern. The continued division of Korea is fundamentally incompatible with the desire of all countries to further ease international tensions and the desire of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has recently made new efforts to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    On October 30, the Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea adopted a letter addressed to the South Korean National Assembly, various political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, and the South Korean people, proposing a conference between North and South Korea to discuss the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the commencement of economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea and other major issues. The letter also proposed that political parties, social organizations, and patriotic figures from all walks of life in North and South Korea should carry out mutual contact and consultation in all aspects to seek countermeasures for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    This appealing call not only demonstrates the consistent position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea but also demonstrates the confidence and strength of the Korean people to solve the problem of peaceful reunification of their motherland themselves.
    Everyone knows that the peaceful reunification of Korea is first and foremost a matter for the Korean people themselves. Therefore, it must and should be resolved by the Koreans themselves. It is the national right of the Korean people and the common desire of all patriotic people in North and South Korea to seek the peaceful reunification of their motherland through internal consultation.
    At the Geneva Conference on the Korean question, when the meeting failed to reach an agreement on the issue of Korean reunification, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed the establishment of an all-Korean committee to formulate measures for establishing and developing economic and cultural relations between North and South Korea to create conditions for bringing North and South Korea closer together. However, this proposal was also unreasonably rejected by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique.
    However, the national desire of the Korean people to rely on themselves to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland cannot be suppressed by any force. This call by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects this desire of the Korean people. The realization of this call will pave the way for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
    In order to promote the rapprochement and consultation between North and South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has adopted an open and aboveboard attitude of reconciliation. The call stated: "In order to discuss the contact between the people of North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, we welcome any form of consultation."
    The call put forward specific measures to create conditions for consultation. The call advocates that North and South Korea should solve issues such as the commencement of economic and cultural exchanges, trade, passage, and correspondence. Political parties, social organizations, and patriotic figures from all walks of life in North and South Korea should have full freedom to contact each other, travel to and from each other, and consult with each other to seek countermeasures for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and create and develop friendly relations between the people of North and South Korea.
    The assertion that the reunification of Korea can only be achieved through the use of force and not through peaceful consultations between North and South Korea is ill-intentioned and unfounded. Although the more than three years of war imposed on the Korean people have created division and hostility between North and South Korea, the Korean people are firmly opposed to "unification by force" and foreign interference. Therefore, it is entirely possible to eliminate these divisions and hostilities as long as necessary measures are taken.
    In the years before the outbreak of the Korean War, a broad and effective consultation movement was launched between the people of North and South Korea to strive for the reunification and independence of the motherland. At that time, the vast majority of political parties, social organizations, and patriotic figures from all walks of life in South Korea responded to and participated in this movement. If the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique had not launched the war, this consultation movement between the people of North and South Korea would have achieved success. Now that the Korean people have tasted the indescribable pain caused by the division of their motherland, it is completely understandable that they are more determined to work for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    Facts have proved that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a powerful pillar for the entire Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Foreign Minister Nam Il stated that all the achievements made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are not only for the people of the northern half of Korea but also for the entire Korean people. All facilities in the northern half of Korea that benefit the people are open to the people of South Korea. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is faithfully serving the interests of the entire Korean people and the cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    It can be asserted that the call of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea will arouse a wide response among the South Korean people and will be supported by every conscientious Korean who hopes that the motherland will achieve peaceful reunification and democratic independence.
    The Chinese people fully support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea and are willing to assist the Korean people in building a peaceful, democratic, unified, and independent country. On September 23 this year, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country, in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, put forward concrete suggestions, advocating that, following the example of the Geneva Conference in resolving the Indochina issue, a conference be held with the participation of Asian neutral countries to re-discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, so as to resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible based on the principle of respecting the national rights of the Korean people and being conducive to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. On October 12, the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union stated in their joint declaration: "The two governments believe that it is necessary to convene a conference on the Korean issue in the near future, with the broad participation of the countries concerned." The declaration pointed out: "The fact that Korea is still divided into two parts violates the natural desire of the Korean people to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Korean state, and this situation is abnormal." This proposal by China and the Soviet Union has received the full support of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    However, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, pursuing the sinister goal of "unification by force," oppose following the path of peaceful consultation to achieve the reunification of Korea. A spokesman for the Syngman Rhee government rashly rejected the call from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on October 29, stating: "We will completely ignore this suggestion from the Communists." The South Korean National Assembly also openly passed a resolution on November 4 stating: "No negotiations between North and South Korea are permitted."
    This attitude of the Syngman Rhee clique is completely contrary to the will of the South Korean people. It is merely implementing the policy of the American aggressor clique to deepen the division of Korea and maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice.
    At the Geneva Conference, the US delegation made it clear that they advocated obliterating the national rights of the Korean people, opposed the Korean people presiding over all-Korean elections themselves, opposed the establishment of economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea; and arbitrarily interrupted the discussion of the Korean issue. In recent months, all the actions of the United States have been aimed at expanding the opposition and hostility between North and South Korea and blocking the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It recklessly expands the Rhee pseudo-army, plots to "disband" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and constantly violates the armistice agreement by shipping reinforcements and combat materials into South Korea and sending armed agents to infiltrate the demilitarized zone and the rear of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to carry out disturbances. It is precisely because of carrying out such a plan that the United States has adopted a lukewarm attitude towards the suggestions put forward by China and the Soviet Union and supported by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding reconvening a conference to discuss the Korean issue. It still insists on its unreasonable position at the Geneva Conference, wanting to use elections "supervised" by the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties, as a precondition for reopening negotiations. This policy of the United States is an obstacle to the efforts of the Korean people to seek the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    However, it is absolutely impossible to obstruct the unification of a country and ignore the natural desire of the heroic nation to build its own peaceful, unified, democratic, and independent country. Is not the shameful failure of the American aggression against the Korean War a powerful proof? The fear of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique of consultations between North and South Korea and the exchanges between the people clearly shows how unpopular their rule in South Korea is. The people of North and South Korea will continue to overcome various obstacles, rebuild and develop the consultations and contacts they carried out before the Korean War, and work together to realize the cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    朝鲜人民谋求祖国和平统一的新的努力
    李高
    朝鲜问题的悬而不决，愈来愈引起人们的关切。目前朝鲜继续陷于分裂的状态，是同各国人民要求进一步缓和国际紧张局势和朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望，根本不相容的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最近为促进朝鲜的和平统一作出了新的努力。
    十月三十日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议通过了致南朝鲜国会、各政党、社会团体、各界人士以及南朝鲜人民的号召书，提议召开南北朝鲜之间的会议来讨论祖国的和平统一以及开始南北朝鲜的经济、文化交流等重大问题。号召书并提议南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体和各阶层爱国人士，从各方面来开展相互的接触和协商，以谋求和平统一祖国的对策。
    这个吸引人心的号召，不但表明了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国争取和平统一朝鲜的一贯立场，而且也显示了朝鲜人民能够自己解决祖国和平统一问题的信心和力量。
    谁也知道，朝鲜的和平统一问题首先是朝鲜人民自己的事情，因此，它必须而且应该由朝鲜人自己来解决。朝鲜人民通过内部的协商来谋求祖国的和平统一，这是朝鲜人民的民族权利，也是南北朝鲜所有爱国人士的共同愿望。
    日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题会议在未能就朝鲜统一问题取得协议时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团曾建议成立一个全朝鲜委员会，来拟订建立和发展南北朝鲜之间的经济文化关系的措施，以创造使南北朝鲜接近的条件。但是，这一建议也被美国和李承晚集团无理拒绝了。
    但是，朝鲜人民依靠自己实现祖国的和平统一的民族愿望，不是任何势力所能压制的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议这一次的号召，正是反映了朝鲜人民的这种愿望；而实现这个号召，就会为和平统一朝鲜开辟途径。
    为了促进南北朝鲜的接近和协商，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面采取了光明磊落的和解态度。号召书中表示：“为了讨论关于南北朝鲜人民的接触和和平统一祖国的问题，我们欢迎任何形式的协商。”
    号召书提出了具体办法，以创造进行协商的条件。号召书主张，南北朝鲜之间应解决开始经济及文化交流、通商、通行、书信来往等问题。南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体和各阶层爱国人士应有充分的自由，互相联络，互相往来，互相接触，以谋求和平统一祖国的对策，创造和发展南北朝鲜人民之间的友谊关系。
    那种硬说朝鲜的统一只能诉诸武力，而不能经由南北朝鲜和平协商的途径来谋求实现的说法，是别有用心的，是毫无根据的。强加在朝鲜人民身上的三年多的战争，虽然已在南北朝鲜之间造成了隔阂和敌视，但朝鲜人民是坚决反对“武力统一”和外国干涉的，因而只要采取必要的措施，消除这些隔阂和敌视是完全可能的。
    早在朝鲜战争发生前的几年中，南北朝鲜人民之间就已开展了广泛的、有效的协商运动，以争取祖国的统一和独立。当时南朝鲜绝大多数政党、社会团体和各阶层爱国人士，都响应和参加了这一运动。如果不是美国和李承晚集团发动了战争，南北朝鲜人民的这种协商运动，是会得到成就的。现在，朝鲜人民备尝了由于祖国的被分割而遭受的难以形容的痛苦，更加坚决地为祖国的和平统一而努力，这是完全可以理解的。
    事实已经证明，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是全朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的有力支柱。南日外务相表示，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所取得的一切成果，不仅是为了朝鲜北半部人民，而且是为了整个朝鲜人民。朝鲜北半部所有造福人民的设施，都向南朝鲜人民敞开着大门。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是忠诚地为全朝鲜人民的利益和祖国的和平统一事业服务的。
    朝鲜最高人民会议的号召，将在南朝鲜人民中引起广泛的反响，得到每一个有良心的、希望祖国获得和平统一和民主独立的朝鲜人的支持，这是可以断言的。
    中国人民完全支持朝鲜人民争取朝鲜和平统一的斗争，愿意协助朝鲜人民建立一个和平、民主、统一和独立的国家。今年九月二十三日，我国周恩来总理兼外交部长在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中，提出了具体的建议，主张仿照日内瓦会议解决印度支那问题的榜样，召开有亚洲中立国家参加的重新讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，以便根据尊重朝鲜人民的民族权利和有利于保障亚洲和世界和平的原则，从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。十月十二日，中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府在其联合宣言中表明：“两国政府认为有必要在最近的将来召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议，由有关各国广泛参加。”宣言指出：“朝鲜至今仍然分裂成为两部分，是违反了朝鲜人民要求建立一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的朝鲜国家的自然愿望的，这种情况，是不正常的。”中苏两国的这个建议，得到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的完全支持。
    但是，美国和李承晚集团追求着“武力统一”的罪恶目的，反对遵循和平协商的途径来使朝鲜达到统一。李承晚政府发言人在十月二十九日就轻率地拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议的号召书，表示：“我们将完全不理会共产党提出的这一建议”。南朝鲜国会在十一月四日也公然通过决议说：“不许可有任何南北朝鲜之间的谈判。”
    李承晚集团的这种态度，是完全违反南朝鲜人民的意志的，它只是在执行美国侵略集团加深朝鲜的分裂，维持朝鲜停战不稳定状态的政策。
    在日内瓦会议上，美国代表团就表明它们主张抹煞朝鲜人民的民族权利，反对朝鲜人民自己主持全朝鲜的选举，反对建立南北朝鲜的经济、文化交流；并蛮横无理地中断了朝鲜问题的讨论。最近几个月来，美国的一切做法，都是为了扩大南北朝鲜的对立和敌视，堵塞和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。它不顾后果地扩充着李伪军，阴谋“解散”中立国监察委员会，不断违反停战协定向南朝鲜运入增援性作战物资和派遣武装特务潜入非军事区和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国后方进行扰乱。正是由于进行着这样的计划，美国对中、苏两国提出的并为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所支持的关于重新召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议的建议，采取冷淡的态度，仍然坚持其在日内瓦会议上的无理立场，要以由交战一方的联合国“监督”选举，作为重开谈判的先决条件。美国的这个政策是朝鲜人民谋求祖国和平统一的努力的障碍。
    但是，阻挠一个国家的统一，无视英雄的民族建立自己的和平、统一、民主和独立的国家的自然愿望，是绝对行不通的。美国侵略朝鲜战争的可耻的失败，不就是有力的证明吗？美国和李承晚集团害怕南北朝鲜的协商和人民之间的来往，清楚地说明他们在南朝鲜的统治是多末的不得人心。南北朝鲜人民将会不断地排除种种障碍，重建和发展他们曾在朝鲜战争以前进行的协商和接触，共同为实现祖国的和平统一事业而努力。
