Promoting acupuncture therapy in Inner Mongolia and the Tibetan areas of Xikang has played a considerable role in the health care of people of all ethnic groups over the past three years.

In August 1952, the Acupuncture Working Group of the Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute of the Central Ministry of Health assisted the Inner Mongolia Ministry of Health in establishing an acupuncture therapy training class, focusing on training forty-six medical cadres from the Inner Mongolia region in acupuncture therapy. In addition, eighty-seven graduates from the sixth term of the Inner Mongolia Health School were trained through short-term crash courses, learning the basic operation methods of acupuncture. After graduation, the trainees of the acupuncture training class were distributed among thirty-five units in the league-level hospitals, health centers, epidemic prevention teams, and sanatoriums in Xing'an League, Jirem League, Hulunbuir League, Chahar League, Ju Ud League, and Xilin Gol League, where they gradually carried out acupuncture medical work. The promotion of acupuncture therapy has relieved many sufferings for the people of Inner Mongolia and has been welcomed by the masses.

Based on the experience of carrying out acupuncture medical work in Inner Mongolia, the Central Ministry of Health, in November 1952, again dispatched an acupuncture working group from the Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute to train acupuncture technical cadres in the Tibetan areas of Xikang, while simultaneously carrying out acupuncture treatment work. In the period of seven months, a total of one hundred and forty-seven trainees were trained in Kangding and Ya'an. The trainees included Han, Tibetan, Hui, and Yi ethnic groups. After graduation, the trainees returned to their work posts and used acupuncture therapy, which was very popular among people of all ethnic groups. According to the outpatient statistics of the three training classes in Kangding and Ya'an, a total of four thousand five hundred and forty-three patients were treated, with nineteen thousand four hundred and fifty initial and follow-up visits. The treatment range included eighty kinds of diseases in eight systems, with diseases of the motor organs, digestive system diseases, nervous system diseases, and gynecological diseases being the most common. Most of these diseases were chronic diseases of many years, with some patients having been ill for several years to decades. After short-term treatment, 95.5% of these patients received benefits.

    根据内蒙地区开展针灸医疗工作的经验，中央卫生部在一九五二年十一月又由针灸疗法实验所抽调一个针灸工作组，在西康藏族地区培养针灸技术干部，同时开展针灸治疗工作。七个月的期间内，在康定和雅安共培养了一百四十七名学员。学员中有汉族、藏族、回族、彝族。学员毕业后回到工作岗位都使用针灸疗法，很受各族人民欢迎。据康定、雅安三期训练班的门诊统计，共接治患者四千五百四十三人，初复诊一万九千四百五十次。治疗范围包括八个系统八十种疾患，其中以运动器官疾病，消化系统疾病，神经系统疾病和妇科疾病为最多。这些疾病多半是多年的慢性疾病，其中有患病期由几年到几十年的，这些疾病经过短期治疗有百分之九十五点五的患者收到了效果。  （徐文生）
