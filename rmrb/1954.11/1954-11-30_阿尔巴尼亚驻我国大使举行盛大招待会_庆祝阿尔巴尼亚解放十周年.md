    Ambassador Nasse's Speech

    Comrade Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, dear comrades and friends!

    I warmly thank you for attending this reception celebrating the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation and extend my welcome to you.

    As the Albanian people celebrate today the tenth anniversary of their liberation from the oppression of the occupiers and domestic feudal bourgeois forces, they recall the centuries of efforts and struggles the Albanian people have waged to restore their homeland and strive for freedom and independence. They remember the blood and sacrifices paid to gain the freedom they enjoy today, and they express their deep gratitude to the glorious Soviet army, which played a decisive role in the liberation of the Albanian people.

    Today, the Albanian people also summarize the achievements of the people's revolution, summarizing the peaceful work they have engaged in over the ten years of the people's rule to build the foundations of socialism for a happy life.

    The Albanian people express their deep gratitude to the working class and laboring peasants, to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, which have wisely led the Albanian people in achieving a series of achievements in political, economic, and cultural fields.

    They express their deep gratitude to the Soviet Union for its great and generous assistance to the Albanian people in the past and present. Soviet assistance is a decisive factor in our country's construction of socialism and defense of our freedom and independence.

    They express their deep gratitude to the People's Republic of China and the People's Democratic countries for their assistance and great contributions to the economic and cultural development of our people. Today, our people once again express their great desire to safeguard world peace, their firm determination to defend peace, and their desire to live in peace with the peace-loving people of other countries.

    Today, our people feel stronger and more powerful than ever because the friendship and brotherly cooperation of the great peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing day by day. The Albanian people hold the People's Republic of China in great respect and sincere love. The Albanian people regard the People's Republic of China as their own powerful, close, and loyal friend, and as an important factor in defending peace in Asia and the world and the progress of mankind.

    The sincere cooperation between our two countries is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, equality between countries, and mutual respect. This sincere cooperation is also based on the great and invincible friendship that unites the people of our two countries, and it is also based on the common ideals and common efforts to build socialism in our two countries.

    The friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people will grow day by day. The Albanian people say: "Our border extends all the way to great China, all the way to the border of the world peace camp." This expresses our people's firm confidence in the great strength of the friendship between our two countries, and the source of this strength is the great friendship that unites the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania with the great friend—the Soviet Union.

    The Albanian people are as delighted with the achievements of the Chinese people as they are with their own achievements, and they sincerely wish the Chinese people new and outstanding achievements. The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the socialist camp and a valuable contribution to maintaining and strengthening world peace.

    Dear comrades and friends, please allow me to raise my glass to the growth of the great and invincible friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people, to the new achievements of the Chinese people in building a great socialist country, to the health and longevity of Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved son of the Chinese people and great leader, and to the health of the Chinese Communist Party and other leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De's Speech

    Dear Ambassador, dear comrades and friends!

    Today is the glorious festival of the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, to extend warm congratulations to the Albanian people and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania.

    Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the support of the People's Democratic countries, the heroic Albanian people have achieved great achievements in political, economic, and cultural fields through arduous struggles and hard work. Over the past ten years, the Albanian government and people have consolidated the people's democratic regime, developed the national economy, and improved the living standards of the people. The glorious achievements of Albania's ten years of construction demonstrate the Albanian people's strength, courage, and high patriotism, and inspire the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction. The Albanian people's noble cause of building their own beautiful life and defending the security of their motherland will always be supported by the Chinese people.

    This year, the two governments exchanged diplomatic envoys, exchanged government delegations for visits, and signed agreements on cultural, technical, and scientific cooperation between the two countries. All of this has further developed and consolidated the fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Chinese and Albanian peoples. I am deeply convinced that the continued development of this friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries will not only promote the socialist construction of our two countries, but also contribute to the cause of world peace.

    Long live the eternal fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Albanian peoples! Long live the world peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union!

    Dear comrades and friends, let us raise our glasses

    For the prosperity of the People's Republic of Albania;

    To the health of Comrade Hoxha, the leader of the Albanian people!

    我热烈地感谢你们参加庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年的招待会，并向你们表示欢迎。
    当阿尔巴尼亚人民今天庆祝他们从占领者和国内封建势力资产阶级压迫下获得解放的十周年的时候，他们想到几世纪来阿尔巴尼亚人民为了恢复国土，争取自由和独立所进行的努力和斗争。他们想到为了获得今天所享有的自由，曾经付出了多少鲜血和牺牲，他们对在阿尔巴尼亚人民解放中起决定性作用的光荣的苏联军队表示深切的感谢。
    今天阿尔巴尼亚人民也总结了人民革命的成果，总结了在人民掌握政权的十年之中他们为了谋求幸福生活建设社会主义基础所从事的和平工作。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民向工人阶级和劳动农民，向英明地领导阿尔巴尼亚人民在政治、经济和文化各方面取得一系列的成就的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府表示深切的谢意。
    他们对苏联过去和现在一直给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大慷慨的帮助，表示深切的谢意，苏联的帮助是我国建设社会主义、保卫我国自由和独立的决定性的因素。
    他们对中华人民共和国和人民民主国家在我国人民的经济和文化发展方面所给予的帮助和巨大的贡献，表示深切的谢意。今天我国人民再一次表示他们维护全世界和平的伟大愿望，保卫和平的坚定决心，以及同其他各国和平人民和平相处的愿望。
    今天我国人民比以往任何时候都感到强大有力，因为以苏联为首的伟大的和平阵营的友谊和兄弟般的合作日益增进。阿尔巴尼亚人民对中华人民共和国怀着巨大的敬意和诚挚的爱戴，阿尔巴尼亚人民把中华人民共和国看作是自己的一个强大、亲近和忠实的朋友，把它看作保卫亚洲和世界和平及人类进步的重要因素。
    我们两国之间的真诚合作，是建立在马克思列宁主义的原则、各国平等以及互相尊重的基础上。这种真诚合作又是以使我们两国人民团结在一起的伟大而不可战胜的友谊为基础的，同时也是以在我们两国内建设社会主义的共同理想和共同努力为基础的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民之间的友谊将日益增进。阿尔巴尼亚人民说：“我们的国境线一直延展到伟大的中国，一直延展到世界和平阵营的边界线。”这表达了我国人民对于我们两国之间友谊的伟大力量的坚定信心，这种力量的泉源是把中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国同伟大的朋友——苏联团结在一起的伟大友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民所取得的成就像对自己所取得的成就一样感到欢欣鼓舞，并衷心祝中国人民获得新的卓越的成就。中国人民的胜利就是社会主义阵营的胜利，也是对维护和加强世界和平的可贵的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，请允许我举杯为阿尔巴尼亚人民同伟大的中国人民之间的伟大而不可战胜的友谊的增进，为中国人民在建设伟大的社会主义国家方面获得新的成就，为中国人民亲爱的儿子、伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的健康和长寿，为中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府其他领导者的健康而干杯。
    朱德副主席的讲话亲爱的大使同志亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年纪念的光辉节日，请允许我代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府致热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在苏联的无私援助下和各人民民主国家的支持下，经过艰苦的斗争和辛勤的劳动，在政治、经济、文化各方面都取得了巨大的成就。十年来，阿尔巴尼亚的政府和人民巩固了人民民主政权，发展了国民经济，提高了人民生活的水平。阿尔巴尼亚十年建设的光辉成就，显示了阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强、勇敢和高度的爱国主义精神，鼓舞了正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民建设自己美好生活和保卫祖国安全的崇高事业，将永远得到中国人民的支持。
    今年两国政府互派了外交使节，互派了政府代表团进行访问，并签订了两国间的文化、技术和科学合作的协定，这一切使得中阿两国人民兄弟般的友谊和亲密合作有了进一步的发展和巩固。我深信，我们两国间这种友好合作关系的继续发展，不但会促进我们两国的社会主义建设，并且有助于世界和平的事业。中阿两国人民永恒的兄弟般的友谊和合作万岁！以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量万岁！
