    The Benefits of Unified Purchase and Supply of Grain for Farmers in Suining Prefecture
    Ji Jie
    Since Suining Prefecture, Sichuan Province, implemented the unified purchase and supply of grain in November last year, the entire area has changed from a situation of importing large quantities of grain every year, ensuring the grain needs of cotton farmers in economic crop areas, and having surplus grain to export to support national industrial construction. At the same time, it has further promoted the socialist transformation of agriculture in the entire area and restricted the growth of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas. Therefore, this measure has won the heartfelt support of the people throughout the area.
    Grain and cotton are the main agricultural products of Suining Prefecture, and cotton production accounts for more than a quarter of the province's cotton production. In the past, the area had insufficient grain and had to import large quantities from other areas. Taking the grain output of the entire area in 1950 as 100, it was 105.6 in 1951, 159 in 1952, and 182 in 1953. However, grain production still could not keep up with the increasing demand. From the perspective of the sales volume of grain by state-owned commercial enterprises in the entire area, rice sales in 1953 increased by 187.54% compared to 1951; wheat sales in 1953 increased by 153.2% compared to 1951. In addition, the proportion of commodity grain in the small-scale peasant economy was very low, and after the improvement of farmers' living standards, they wanted to eat more and store more grain; and the speculation and sabotage of urban and rural capitalists in grain further fueled farmers' reluctance to sell grain. Therefore, extreme discrepancies gradually occurred in the purchase and sale of grain by state-owned commercial departments. This situation of low purchases and high supply became even more prominent in 1953. The state had to use the grain collected as agricultural tax and more grain transferred from other areas to guarantee the needs of the people.
    The basic method proposed by the Party and the government to solve this contradiction is to vigorously develop agricultural cooperativization and improve technology to increase production. But in addition to this, unified purchase and supply must also be implemented in grain circulation to eliminate grain speculation and overcome grain waste. Last winter, due to extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among the broad masses of farmers regarding the Party's general line during the transition period, the socialist consciousness of the farmers was raised, and the broad masses of farmers enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to support the socialist industrialization cause. In September 1953 alone, grain purchases reached 46,360,000 jin, more than one and a half times higher than the same period in 1951. After the implementation of unified purchase, the situation of importing large quantities of grain in the entire area in the past was changed. In addition to self-sufficiency, the entire area also had surplus grain to be transferred out to support national industrial construction. In 1951, excluding private merchant trafficking, the government transferred in 10,590,000 jin of grain from other areas, which increased to 135,670,000 jin in 1952. However, after the state implemented the unified purchase and supply of grain in 1953, the entire area transferred out 89,000,000 jin of grain. Because the state controlled the grain, it guaranteed the supply of cotton farmers in economic crop areas, encouraged the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers, and eliminated the concerns of many cotton farmers who were worried about insufficient grain and wanted to reduce cotton fields. This year, the cotton planting area in the entire area has expanded to 1,060,000 mu, an increase of 15% compared to last year. In addition, this year the entire area transferred out 160,000 jin of wheat and broad bean seeds to the flood-stricken areas in the Yangtze River basin to help the people in the disaster areas restore production. In the past year, grain prices in the entire area have not risen or fallen except for the due seasonal price differences and planned adjustments, and the prices of various commodities have also been stable. These are the benefits that unified purchase and supply have brought to the people of the entire area.
    The price at which the state purchases grain from farmers is reasonable and beneficial to farmers. In 1953, the entire area purchased a total of 140,000,000 jin of grain, and the grain purchase price increased by 8% compared to 1952. In the past, when the free grain market existed, private grain merchants arbitrarily lowered prices after the grain was put on the market. In the most serious cases, the price at which farmers sold grain was 40% lower than the average market price. In the autumn of 1953, when the grain was just put on the market, the price of the Zhouli Grain Company in Anyue County was 480 yuan, while local private merchants illegally purchased from farmers at 430 yuan. According to this calculation, in 1953, farmers in the entire area avoided a loss of 11,420 million yuan. Adding the 8% increase in the state's purchase price, the two items totaled, which is equivalent to increasing the income of farmers in the entire area by 16,790 million yuan in the unified purchase of grain, which could buy 19,444 head of cattle in the area. This fact greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production. After selling their surplus grain, they invested a large amount of surplus funds in production, which promoted the development of agricultural production this year. For example, 78 farmers in the second village of Yufeng Township, Suining County, used more than 70% of the money from selling surplus grain to buy production materials such as oil cake. According to statistics from supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the area, in 1953, the supply of fertilizers and oil cakes to farmers was worth 57.5 billion yuan. In the first half of this year alone, the supply of these production materials increased to 54.6 billion yuan, almost equal to the total value of the whole year last year.
    After the implementation of unified purchase and supply of grain, the broad masses of farmers in the entire area received a profound education on the Party's general line during the transition period, recognized that socialism is the only correct path, and thus strengthened their will to take the socialist road. In recent years, with the development of the rural economy, the spontaneous capitalist forces of farmers have grown to some extent. After many farmers have accumulated some savings, they have gradually begun to hoard grain, lend money at usurious rates, and engage in commercial activities. More than 20 farmers in Penglai Township, Pengxi County, have invested in industry and commerce; some farmers in Zhongjiang County are vying to purchase street houses in towns, and some farmers even do not pay attention to agricultural production and do not actively engage in mutual assistance and cooperation. One-third of the mutual aid teams in Taiji Township, Pengxi County, are disintegrated, and the situation is generally the same in all counties in the area. However, after the unified purchase of grain, a huge change occurred in the social atmosphere. The ideas and behaviors of pursuing personal wealth and taking the capitalist road in rural areas were criticized by social opinion, while engaging in mutual assistance and cooperation became a top honor. Due to this mass base, coupled with the correct leadership of the Party, the mutual assistance and cooperation in rural areas throughout the area not only had new developments in quantity, but also greatly improved in quality. The number of mutual aid teams in the entire area has increased from 80,000 to 100,000, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased from 7 to 1,469. After Hechi Township in Suining County implemented the unified purchase of grain, those farmers who were nostalgic for doing small businesses were criticized by social opinion. Farmer Xiang Jixiang's family has been a cattle dealer for generations. After last year's unified purchase, he saw that it was impossible to make a living by dealing in cattle. After joining the cooperative this year, he reaped a bumper harvest. He said, "I have taken the right path." Zhang Shangxian, director of the third village, said, "After the unified purchase of grain, the mutual aid team is easier to lead." Last year, there was only one agricultural production cooperative in the entire township, and this year seven new cooperatives have been established. The mutual aid teams in the entire township have been merged into 27 joint teams.
    After the unified purchase and supply of grain, rural credit cooperative organizations have developed unprecedentedly. Before the unified purchase of grain last year, there were only two credit cooperatives in the entire area. By the end of October this year, 257 credit cooperatives and 604 credit groups have been developed, with a total of 583,996 members and 100,359 group members, accounting for 48.6% of the total number of farmers in the area. The credit cooperatives and groups have received 13 billion yuan in share capital. In the past year, the credit cooperatives and groups in the entire area have issued more than 7 billion yuan in loans, helping farmers solve their production difficulties and giving a powerful blow to rural usury exploitation. In 1953, there were 48 households lending money at usurious rates in Jinqiao Township, Pengxi County, and 109 households were exploited by usurious loans. After the unified purchase of grain, a credit cooperative was established. In the spring and summer of this year, 67.48 million yuan in loans were issued, and no household in the entire township was lending money at usurious rates or being exploited by usurious loans.
    Due to the great development of agricultural production cooperation and credit cooperation, the trend of class differentiation in rural areas has been greatly weakened. When farmers encounter difficulties, in addition to the various assistance provided by the state, they can also obtain grain supply and advance purchase grain deposits. The development of agricultural mutual assistance cooperation and credit cooperation has also provided favorable conditions for poor farmers to overcome various difficulties. For example, in Suining County from April to October 1953, there were 223 incidents in which some farmers were forced to sell their land due to production and living difficulties, and most of them fell into a state of family bankruptcy, but in the same period this year, no household sold land. According to a survey of two villages in Nanya Township, Suining County, last year there were 55 poor farmers who sold empty granaries and green crops, accounting for 10% of the total number of households, selling a total of 3,600 jin of yellow rice. After one month, the principal and interest were more than 6,390 jin. Among them, 70% of the farmers were forced to sell or pawn their land. This year, the phenomenon of usury and land sales has disappeared in these two villages. It is particularly worth pointing out that after the unified purchase and supply of grain, a new moral atmosphere has been established in rural areas, that is, diligent production, unity and mutual assistance, and taking the road to common prosperity. The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Suining County helped 21 poor households this year. After the unified purchase of grain, 29 poor households in the sixth village of Longqiao Township, Anyue County, participated in the mutual aid team and received everyone's care and help, avoiding bankruptcy.
    The unified purchase and supply of grain cut off the connection between capitalist forces and farmers in terms of grain, effectively restricted the spontaneous capitalist forces of the small-scale peasant economy, stabilized the market, and ensured the steady rise in the living standards of the broad masses of people. At present, 334 grain markets led by the state have been established throughout the area, which is convenient for farmers to adjust surpluses and deficiencies and exchange varieties in terms of grain.
    This year's grain production has increased. Due to the increased enthusiasm of farmers for production and the development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, this year's unified grain purchase work will achieve greater results. During the autumn harvest, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams throughout the area have formulated plans to sell surplus grain to support national industrialization, support disaster areas, and support the liberation of Taiwan. A upsurge of selling more grain to the state has been set off in rural areas. Many farmers have also adopted various methods to save grain in order to sell more surplus grain to the state. By October 12 this year, although the unified purchase had just begun, the state had already purchased 144.48 million jin of yellow rice, reaching the total unified purchase figure for last year. The unified grain purchase work is now continuing.

    粮食统购统销给遂宁专区农民带来的好处
    吉杰
    四川省遂宁专区自去年十一月实行了粮食统购和统销以来，全区改变了历年大量粮食输入的情况，保证了经济作物区棉农的粮食需要，并且有余粮输出支援国家工业建设；同时进一步促进了全区农业社会主义改造，限制了农村资本主义自发势力的滋长。因此，这项措施获得了全区人民的衷心拥护。
    粮食和棉花是遂宁专区主要农产品，棉花产量约占全省棉花产量四分之一以上。历年来本区粮食不足，要从外区大量输入。全区粮食产量以一九五○年为一百，一九五一年是一百零五点六，一九五二年是一百五十九，一九五三年是一百八十二。但是，粮食的生产还是赶不上日益增长的需要。从全区国营商业粮食销售量来看，大米销售量一九五三年比一九五一年增加百分之一百八十七点五四；小麦销售量一九五三年比一九五一年增加百分之一百五十三点二。再加之小农经济商品粮食的比率很低，农民生活水平提高后，要多吃些和多储存些粮食；以及城乡资本主义分子在粮食上的投机捣乱，更助长了农民的惜售心理。因此，国营商业部门在粮食销售与收购方面逐渐发生了极大的差额。这种收购少、供应多的情况，到一九五三年更加突出了。国家只好以征收到的粮食税的粮食和由外区调来更多的粮食来保证人民的需要。
    党和政府提出解决这个矛盾的基本方法，是大力发展农业的合作化和改良技术，以增加生产。但除此之外，还必须在粮食流通方面实行统购统销，以消灭粮食投机，克服粮食浪费。去年冬季由于向广大农民进行了广泛、深入的关于党在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，提高了农民的社会主义觉悟，广大农民热烈拥护国家的粮食政策，踊跃出卖余粮，支援社会主义工业化事业。仅一九五三年九月，粮食收购即达四千六百三十六万斤，比一九五一年同期增加了一倍半以上。实行统购后，改变了全区历年来大量粮食输入的情况，全区粮食除自给以外，还有余粮外调，支援国家工业建设。一九五一年除私商贩运外，政府由外区调进粮食一千零五十九万斤，一九五二年增加到一亿三千五百六十七万斤。但是，一九五三年国家实行粮食统购统销以后，全区却向外调出了八千九百万斤粮食。由于国家掌握了粮食，保证了经济作物区棉农的供应，鼓舞了棉农的生产热情，消除了许多棉农担心粮食不足、想缩小棉田的顾虑。今年全区棉花种植面积扩大到一百零六万亩，比去年增加了百分之十五。此外，今年全区向长江流域水灾区调出了小麦和葫豆种十六万斤，帮助灾区人民恢复生产。一年来全区粮价除了应有的季节差价和有计划的调整以外，没有上涨和下降，各种商品价格也是稳定的。这是统购统销给全区人民带来的好处。
    国家向农民收购粮食的价格是合理的，对农民有利的。一九五三年全区共统购粮食一亿四千万斤，粮食收购价比一九五二年提高了百分之八。在过去粮食自由市场存在的情况下，粮食上市后，私营粮商任意杀价，最严重时农民出卖粮食价格比平均市价低百分之四十。一九五三年秋季粮食刚上市时，安岳县周礼场国营粮食公司牌价是四百八十元，当地私商则以四百三十元向农民盗购。依此推算，一九五三年全区农民就避免了一百一十四亿二千万元的损失，加上国家收购价提高百分之八，两项合计，等于使全区农民在粮食统购中增加了一百六十七亿九千万元的收入，这笔收入在本区可买一万九千四百四十四头耕牛。这一事实大大地鼓励了农民的生产积极性，他们卖出余粮以后，把大量余款投入生产，促进了今年农业生产的发展。如遂宁县玉峰乡二村七十八户农民，把百分之七十以上的出卖余粮的钱，买了油枯等生产资料。据全区供销合作社统计，一九五三年供给农民肥料、油饼等价值五百七十五亿元，仅今年上半年这些生产资料的供应额就增加到五百四十六亿元，几乎和去年全年总值相等。
    实行粮食统购统销以后，全区广大农民受到了党在过渡时期总路线的深刻教育，认清了社会主义是唯一正确的道路，从而坚定了走社会主义道路的意志。几年来，随着农村经济的发展，农民的资本主义自发势力有所增长，不少农民有了一些积蓄以后，就逐渐开始囤粮，放高利贷和兼营商业。蓬溪县蓬莱乡农民向工商业投资的有二十多户；中江县有些农民争购市镇上的街房，甚至有些农民不注意农业生产，不积极搞互助合作。蓬溪县太吉乡有三分之一的互助组是涣散的，全区各县也大体如此。但在粮食统购以后，社会风气就发生了巨大的变化。在农村中贪图个人发财，走资本主义道路的思想、行为，受到社会舆论的批判，而搞互助合作则成为顶荣誉的事情。由于有了这样的群众基础，再加上党的正确领导，就使得全区农村互助合作不但在数量上有新的发展，而且质量也大大提高。全区互助组由八万个发展到十万个，农业生产合作社由七个发展到一千四百六十九个。遂宁县和赤乡实行粮食统购以后，那些留恋做小生意的农民，受到了社会舆论的批评。农民向吉祥家几辈人都是兼做牛贩子，去年统购后他看透了做牛生产是走不通了，今年入社后获得了丰收，他说：“我这条路子算是走对了。”三村村主任张尚贤说：“粮食统购以后，互助组好领导了。”全乡去年只有一个农业生产合作社，今年建立了七个新社，全乡互助组已合并成了二十七个联组。
    粮食统购统销后，农村信用合作组织有了空前的发展。去年粮食统购前全区只有两个信用合作社，到今年十月底，已发展了二百五十七个信用社、六百零四个信用组，共有社员五十八万三千九百九十六户、组员十万零三千五百九十九户，占全区总农户的百分之四十八点六，信用社、组已收到股金一百三十亿元。一年来，全区信用合作社、组共发放贷款七十多亿元，帮助农民解决了生产上的困难，对农村高利贷剥削给了有力的打击。一九五三年蓬溪县金桥乡有四十八户放高利贷，受高利贷剥削的有一百零九户，粮食统购后，建立了信用合作社，今年春夏两季发放了六千七百四十八万元贷款，全乡再没有一户放高利贷或受高利贷剥削的了。
    由于农业生产合作和信用合作的巨大发展，农村阶级分化的趋势大大减弱了。农民遇到困难时，除了国家予以各种帮助外，还可以得到粮食供应和预购粮食订金。而农业互助合作和信用合作的发展，也都给贫困农户提供了克服各种困难的有利条件。如遂宁县一九五三年四月到十月，有些农民碰到生产和生活上的困难被迫出卖土地的事件有二百二十三起，大多数陷于家庭破产的境地，但是今年同一时期，没有一户出卖土地。据遂宁县南垭乡两个村的调查，去年卖空仓和青苗的困难农民有五十五户，占总户数的百分之十，共卖三千六百斤黄谷，一月后到期，还本利六千三百九十多斤。其中有百分之七十的农民被迫出卖或典当了自己的土地。今年这两个村高利贷和出卖土地的现象已经绝迹了。特别值得指出的是，在粮食统购统销后，一种新的道德风气在农村里树立起来，这就是勤劳生产，团结互助，走大家富裕的道路。遂宁县红光农业生产合作社，今年就帮助了二十一户困难户。安岳县龙桥乡六村在粮食统购后有二十九户困难户参加了互助组，得到大家的关怀和帮助，避免了破产。
    粮食统购统销割断了资本主义势力同农民在粮食方面的联系，有力地限制了小农经济的自发资本主义势力，稳定了市场，保证了广大人民生活的稳步上升。现在，全区已建立了由国家领导的粮食市场三百三十四个，便于农民在粮食方面互相调剂有无和交换品种。
    今年粮食增产，由于农民生产积极性的提高，互助合作运动的发展，今年粮食统购工作将获得更大的成绩。秋收的时候，全区各农业生产合作社和互助组纷纷制订了出卖余粮的计划，来支援国家工业化，支援灾区和支援解放台湾。农村中掀起了多卖粮食给国家的热潮。许多农民并采取了各种节省粮食的办法，以便把更多的余粮卖给国家。到今年十月十二日，虽然统购刚刚开始，国家已经收购了一亿四千四百八十万斤黄谷，达到了去年全部统购的数字。现在粮食统购工作正在继续进行着。
