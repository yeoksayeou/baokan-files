The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began establishing credit cooperatives in the second half of 1952 and has now achieved considerable success. By the end of October this year, 724 credit cooperatives had been established throughout the region, and it is planned to increase this to 1,300 by next spring. The Hetao Administrative Region plans to have cooperatives in every township by the end of the year, and the Hulunbuir League plans to achieve this by next spring.

In the process of establishing credit cooperatives, the masses showed great enthusiasm. In areas such as the Chahar League and the Pingdiquan Administrative Region, the masses voluntarily collected shares, built houses, and requested the establishment of cooperatives. Local people's governments trained a large number of cadres to lead the establishment of cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from January to September this year, 2,819 credit cooperative cadres have been trained throughout the region.

The reason why the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen in Inner Mongolia actively participate in credit cooperatives is because they have understood the benefits of credit cooperatives based on the actual conditions in the region. The broad masses of the people believe that credit cooperatives have two major benefits: first, they severely cracked down on usurers. In previous years, there were usury activities in many areas of Inner Mongolia, with monthly interest rates as high as 10% to 15%. After the establishment of credit cooperatives in various regions, various methods were adopted to fight against usurers. For example, satisfying the loan requirements of poor households as much as possible, so that usurers are isolated; if someone is found to have borrowed high-interest loans, loans are quickly given to him so that he can return the loans borrowed at high interest, etc. After adopting these methods in many areas, usurers were finally forced to deposit their remaining money into the state bank. Another benefit of credit cooperatives is that they have helped farmers and herdsmen develop production. According to statistics from only 34 credit cooperatives, the loans they issued in the first half of this year helped members and some poor households purchase 399 head of livestock, 108 carts, 1,651 pieces of agricultural implements, more than 185,300 catties of seeds, more than 11,200 catties of grain, more than 30,700 catties of feed, and more than 277,900 catties of rice straw; in addition, they also helped some farmers and herdsmen solve difficulties in weddings and funerals. Therefore, many farmers and herdsmen call credit cooperatives their "small bank," "big backer," or "chief steward." Wang Zhiyi, a farmer in Dalat Houqi, Hetao Administrative Region, did not have milk to feed his child after the child was born, so he borrowed money from the credit cooperative to buy a dairy cow, and also gave the child a good name: "Xinyong'er" (Credit Son).

### 内蒙古广大人民积极参加信用合作社

    内蒙古广大人民积极参加信用合作社
    内蒙古自治区从一九五二年下半年开始建立信用合作社，现在已经取得不少成绩。到今年十月底，全区已经建立信用合作社七百二十四个，并准备在明年春天发展到一千三百个。河套行政区计划在年底达到乡乡有社，呼伦贝尔盟计划到明年春天达到乡乡有社。
    在建立信用合作社的过程中，群众热情很高。察哈尔盟、平地泉行政区等地的群众纷纷自动收集股金，修盖房屋，请求建社。各地人民政府训练了大批干部，领导开展建社工作。据今年一月到九月份的不完全统计，全区已训练信用合作干部二千八百一十九人。
    内蒙古广大农民、牧民所以积极参加信用合作社，是因为他们根据该区实际情况了解了信用合作社的好处。广大人民都认为信用合作社有两大好处：一是严重地打击了高利贷者。前几年，内蒙古不少地区有高利贷活动，月息高达十分到十五分。各地信用合作社建立以后，就采用各种办法同高利贷者展开斗争。如尽量满足贫困户贷款的要求，使高利贷者陷于孤立；发现有人借了高利贷，就赶紧贷款给他，让他退还用高利借的贷款等。许多地区经过采用这些办法，迫使高利贷者最后不得不把余款存入国家银行。信用合作社的另一个好处是扶助农民、牧民发展了生产。仅据三十四个信用合作社的统计，今年上半年它们发放的贷款，就帮助社员和部分贫苦户购买牲畜三百九十九头、大车一百零八辆、农具一千六百五十一件、种籽十八万五千三百多斤、粮食一万一千二百多斤、饲料三万零七百多斤、稻草二十七万七千九百斤；另外，还帮助部分农民、牧民解决了婚丧中的困难。因此，许多农民、牧民都把信用合作社叫做自己的“小银行”、“大靠山”，或者“总掌柜的”。河套行政区达拉特后旗农民王志义生了小孩没有奶吃，就向信用合作社借款买了一头乳牛，还给小孩取了个好名字：“信用儿”。　（本报内蒙古记者站）
