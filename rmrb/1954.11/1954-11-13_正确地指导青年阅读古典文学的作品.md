    Correctly Guide Young People in Reading Classical Literature Works
    Li Geng
    Literature is an important undertaking in educating the people, especially young people. Our literary circles, especially those engaged in the study of classical literature, do not pay enough attention to the various problems and biases that occur extensively among young people when reading classical literature works. They do not seriously take responsibility for correctly guiding young people. Instead, they allow the reactionary ideas of the Hu Shih faction of the bourgeoisie to gain the upper hand in the field of classical literature research, and allow this kind of thinking to poison young people, influencing some young people to disregard the socio-political content of the works, fostering a tendency to detach themselves from and evade reality. This error is intolerable.
    Among ordinary young people, there are quite a few who like to read classical literary works such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and the News Publication Office estimated that among the books rented and sold by the 2,502 main book stalls in Shanghai that target young people, the above-mentioned types of novels account for 25%. In recent years, because the state publishing house has reprinted these classical masterpieces, and the publishing and literary circles have widely recommended them to young people, the situation where many progressive youths did not read classical literature works in the early days of liberation has greatly changed. Many students, young cadres in government agencies, and young people in the army are now new readers of classical literature works. This situation shows that correctly guiding the reading of classical literature works today is no longer a matter that only concerns a few people, but a mass issue that concerns the broad masses of young people.
    Young people have many questions when reading classical novels. Letters reflecting reading situations and requesting solutions to difficulties account for an average of one-eighth of the letters on literary topics received by the "China Youth Daily" each month; in the "China Youth" magazine, this accounted for 19% in September this year. The letters and articles from young people discussing classical literature works (which actually also reflect situations and problems), totaled 602 pieces in six months in "Literary Study" alone. This does not include the materials from other literary publications. The facts further show that a large number of young people's study of classical literature works urgently requires guidance.
    It is not surprising that a considerable number of young people with low political and cultural levels, simple social life experiences, and a lack of historical knowledge often misunderstand classical literature works after reading them. The literary circles are aware of this situation. Relevant materials, reports, and symposiums have reflected this in many ways. Even publications have publicly reflected this situation. The "Reading Notes" column in the 11th issue of "Literary Gazette" this year, in an article entitled "On the Reading of Classical Literature Works," wrote: "The editorial department has received many articles and letters concerning how to understand and study classical works." The "Editor's Note" in the 13th issue of "Literary Heritage" in the "Guangming Daily" on July 25th also wrote: "What readers urgently need are articles that specifically analyze and evaluate classical literature works from a scientific point of view and guide the reading of classical literature works, and are not very interested in tedious textual research that uses lengthy works to explain a certain annotation, the meaning of a certain word or sentence, or to discuss certain individual minor issues."
    However, little guidance work has been done in this area. As Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling said: "As long as we carefully browse through relevant books and magazines, it will not be difficult to find that truly comprehensive analyses and criticisms of a writer's thoughts or the content of a work using correct viewpoints and methods are very rare, while a large amount of textual research on the author's life and the details of the work are lengthy and repetitive." Dealing with the "large number" of problems existing among the masses with "very little" - that is the reality. Progressive literary workers do not pay attention to this work, do not criticize the repetitive errors, and the old reactionary ideas occupy this position, spreading harmful things to young people from here.
    Introducing "Dream of the Red Chamber" to the broad masses of young readers from the viewpoint and method of bourgeois idealism will not only guide them to pursue some minor details of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and go astray; but will also guide them to escape the political struggle of reality. In today's transitional period of complex and acute class struggle, we cannot assume that there is no possibility of "misleading the younger generation" simply because young people read less of these types of articles than of the classical works themselves. Since it is circulating in society, and since it is circulating among older people and those engaged in cultural and educational work, its bad ideas will influence and erode young people.
    Literary circles have tolerated the bourgeois idealist viewpoint in the study and interpretation of classical literature, and allowed them to distort these works to young people. But young people are dissatisfied with this explanation. The proof of this dissatisfaction is their hundreds of letters, all asking for explanations of the political and social content of the works, demanding that the characters in the book be correctly analyzed from a materialist historical point of view, and demanding solutions to the question of how to learn from classical literature works. Analyzing the questions raised by young people from the materials of "China Youth Daily," "China Youth," and "Literary Study," it can be seen that the nature of the vast majority of the questions is not wrong, and they are asking the literary circles to explain classical literature works from a political and ideological perspective using Marxism-Leninism. Some people, when encountering these types of questions, criticize the youth for this inadequacy and that fault because they contain partial and extreme elements. Of course, young people have inadequacies and faults, and they should be criticized and asked to correct them. For example, pointing out the narrow understanding of the educational role of literature and art that is widespread among young people is completely justified. But we must never ignore the importance of the issues raised by the young masses because of this, and we should positively interpret the meaning of the works. However, this work has been seriously neglected.
    Some progressive literary workers do not actively study and guide the reading of classical literature works, and tolerate the rampant spread of bourgeois ideology in this field. They have certain views: the more common ones are "don't be too hasty" and "it's very difficult, very difficult." In addition, there are also arguments such as "no need to explain, they won't understand when they are young, they will have their own understanding when they grow up." What is often said is "it is still difficult to do today, and I don't want to answer such fundamental and important questions."
    It cannot be said that the saying "don't be too hasty" has no reason. Literary criticism is not a simple task in itself, and to study, especially to completely and correctly interpret classical literature works, and to explain many related issues clearly, it is indeed not a matter of overnight success. It cannot be said that the saying "very difficult" is completely wrong either. Because there are indeed many issues, such as the analysis of the socio-economic conditions at the time of the creation of "Dream of the Red Chamber," that still need to be studied. However, it is not right to excessively emphasize "take your time" and emphasize "difficulties" to the point of affecting the courage to be responsible and the courage to fight.
    So many young people are reading classical literature works, and they have raised so many questions, and they are urgently asking for solutions. Isn't that "urgent" enough? Without guidance, good works have instead produced certain side effects; and bourgeois ideas represented by Yu Pingbo's "Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" are circulating there. Answering more questions first (not requiring everything to be solved), doing more popular analysis and explanations first (not requiring complete conclusions to be given), is not very difficult.
    The classical literature works that are now being reprinted only have publishing instructions, but no preface explaining the content of the works and guiding the readers. This is a big shortcoming. Everyone admits that such a preface is needed, but because of the "difficulty," it is simply not there. We must not overemphasize the difficulties. Conducting research from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, even at the beginning, may inevitably have some omissions or even individual errors due to the lack of materials and knowledge, but it is always better than something with wrong viewpoints and methods. It is also not true that "New Redology" is difficult to criticize. Comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling used their newly forged axes to shatter the bourgeois formalist "New Redology" and basically correctly explained some of the issues in "Dream of the Red Chamber."
    Some of our comrades do not have the courage to launch debates, fearing that they will not be able to reach conclusions, and show weakness and timidity towards so-called "authorities." They have forgotten that the working class should not hesitate or be timid on the ideological struggle front. Some comrades are only afraid that their articles are incomplete, have shortcomings, and will be criticized. Since they cannot write a "conclusion" for a while, they simply do not write, so they do not make mistakes. Being too "cherishing" of oneself results in abandoning one's fighting responsibility.
    It cannot be denied that many comrades are seriously engaged in the research of classical literature, and are solidly laying the foundation. This is extremely necessary. But there are also individual comrades in "research" who, from their methods, are frightened by the bourgeois set of "secret books," "unseen materials," "authorities," "more than thirty years," "detailed textual research efforts," etc., and therefore follow them, also go to abandon the essential and pursue the superficial, also delve into the pile of old papers, and are actually captured.
    It's worth being vigilant! After receiving a profound education from the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," some of our comrades still do not clearly distinguish between the ideas of the working class and the bourgeoisie, and are not sensitive to the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie. Individual party members even support that kind of bourgeois erroneous thinking, or dare not criticize those so-called "authorities." This kind of decadent liberalism is indeed far from the principles of Marxism-Leninism, but is close to the smell of the bourgeoisie. In reviewing, how can we not deeply blame ourselves, how can we not quickly wake up?

    正确地指导青年阅读古典文学的作品
    李庚
    文学是教育人民首先是教育青年的重要事业。我们的文艺界、特别是古典文学研究工作者不重视广大青年在阅读古典文学作品时大量发生的各种问题和偏向，不认真负起正确地指导青年的责任，反而听任胡适派资产阶级的反动思想在古典文学研究工作领域中占了上风，听任这种思想毒害青年，影响有些青年不问作品的社会政治内容，滋长了脱离和逃避现实的倾向。这个错误是不可容忍的。
    一般青年当中，喜欢看“红楼梦”、“水浒”、“三国演义”等古典文学作品的人，本来不少。上海市文化事业管理局和新闻出版处估计：上海全市二千五百零二家主要以青少年为对象的书摊，去年租售的书籍中，上述一类小说要占百分之二十五。近年来，因为国家出版社重版了这些古典名著，出版界、文艺界又向青年广为推荐。解放初期许多进步青年不看古典文学作品的情况，已经大有变化。很多学生、机关青年干部和部队的青年，现在都是古典文学作品的新的读者。这个情形说明：正确地指导阅读古典文学作品，在今天已不是只关系到少数人的事，而是关系到广大青年的群众性的问题了。
    青年在阅读古典小说时疑问很多。反映阅读情况、要求解决疑难的来信，在“中国青年报”，每月平均占文艺方面来信的八分之一；在“中国青年”杂志，以今年九月为例，占百分之十九。青年们讨论古典文学作品的来信来稿（实际也是反映了情况和问题的），仅“文艺学习”一处，六个月中共收到六百零二件。这里还没提到其他文学刊物的材料。事实又说明了：极大数量的青年对古典文学作品的学习，是迫切要求着指导的。
    相当多政治、文化水平不高，社会生活经历简单，历史知识缺乏的青年人，看了古典文学作品，往往发生误解，那是没有什么可以奇怪的。文艺界是知道这种情况的。有关资料、汇报和座谈会都有许多反映。就是刊物上也公开反映了这种情况。“文艺报”今年第十一号的“读稿随谈”栏所载“关于古典文学作品的阅读”一文中写道：“编辑部收到的来稿和信件中，有许多是关于怎样认识和学习古典作品的问题的。”今年七月二十五日“光明日报”“文学遗产”第十三期的“编者的话”中也写道：“读者所急切需要的是以科学观点具体地分析、评介古典文学作品和指导古典文学作品阅读的文章，而对于用长篇大作来解释某一条注释，某一字一句含义或讨论某些个别的小问题的繁琐考证不大感兴趣”。
    但这方面的指导工作却做得很少。正如李希凡、蓝翎两同志所说：“只要我们认真地翻阅一下有关的书刊杂志，将不难发现，真正地运用正确的观点和方法去全面地分析和批评一个作家的思想或一部作品的内容的著作却是微乎其微的，而大量的关于作者身世和作品的细节的考证却是连篇累牍。”以“微乎其微”来对待群众中“大量存在”的问题——事实就是如此。进步的文艺工作者不注意这个工作，不对连篇累牍的错误进行批判，旧有的反动思想观点就占领了这一块阵地，从这里向青年传播着有害的东西。
    用资产阶级唯心论的观点、方法向广大青年读者介绍“红楼梦”，不仅会引导他们去追寻“红楼梦”的一些旁枝末节，走入邪门；而且也会引导他们逃避现实的政治斗争。在国家过渡时期阶级斗争复杂、尖锐的今天，不能因为这类文章比起古典作品本身来，青年看得较少，就以为没有“误人子弟”的可能。它既然在社会上流传，既然在年长的和担任文化、教育工作的人中间流传，它的坏思想就要影响和侵蚀到青年中去。
    文艺界容忍了古典文学研究阐释中的资产阶级唯心论观点，听任他们向青年曲解这些作品。但青年们对这种解释是不满意的。不满意的证据就是他们的成百封来信，都要求解释作品的政治社会内容，要求以唯物的历史观点，正确分析书中人物，要求解决如何向古典文学作品学习的问题。从“中国青年报”、“中国青年”、“文艺学习”的资料来分析青年所提出的问题，可以看出，最大多数的问题的性质是没有错误的，是向文艺界要求从政治上思想上以马克思列宁主义来解释古典文学作品的。有些人遇到这类问题，因为其中包含有片面、偏激的东西，就批评青年这个不够，那个不对。青年当然有不够和不对的地方，应该批评，要求他们改正。譬如指出青年中普遍存在的对文艺教育作用的偏狭的理解，就是完全应该的。但决不能因此就忽视青年群众提出的问题的重要性，应该正面地阐释作品的意义。然而这一工作却被严重地忽视了。
    有些进步的文学工作者不积极去研究和指导阅读古典文学作品，容忍了资产阶级思想在这个领域里泛滥。他们有一定的看法：较普遍的是“不要太急”和“很困难，很不容易”。此外也还有“不必解释，小时看不懂，大了自有体会”的论调。常说的是“今天还很难做到，还不想来回答这样根本的、重大的问题”。
    “不要太急”之说，不能说没有一点道理。文学批评本不是一件简单的工作，要研究特别是要完全正确地解释古典文学作品，讲清楚许多有关的问题，的确非一朝一夕之功。“很困难”之说，也不能说是完全错了。因为的确有许多问题，例如“红楼梦”产生时的社会经济状况分析之类，就还有待于研究。但是过分强调了“慢慢来”，强调了“困难”，以致影响到不敢负责，不勇于战斗，那就不对了。
    这样多的青年在看古典文学作品，又提出了这样多的问题，他们又纷纷急迫地要求解决。难道还不“急”么？没有指导，好作品反而起了某些副作用；而以俞平伯“红楼梦研究”为代表的资产阶级思想又在那里流传。先多答复一些问题（并不是要求什么都解决），先多做一些通俗的分析和解释（并不要求就给完整的定论），那是并不十分困难的。
    现在重印的古典文学作品只有出版说明，没有阐释作品内容，指导读者的序，这是很大的缺点。大家都承认需要这样的序，但因为“困难”只好没有。不能过于夸大困难。以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法来进行研究，即使在开始，因为掌握的材料和知识少，难免有若干疏漏之处，甚至有个别错误，但总比观点、方法都错误了的东西要来得强。说“新红学”不易批判，也不见得。李希凡、蓝翎两同志就以初出炉的斧头，击破了资产阶级形式主义的“新红学”，并基本上正确地讲清了“红楼梦”的某些问题。
    我们有些同志没有勇气发动论争，生怕做不了结论，对所谓“权威”表现得软弱、怯懦。忘了工人阶级在思想斗争战线上，是不应该踌躇不前，畏首畏尾的。有些同志只怕自己文章不完整，有缺点，受批评，一时既写不出“定论”，就率性不写，倒不犯错误。太“珍惜”自己的结果，却是放弃了自己应负的战斗责任。
    不能否认，有很多同志是在认真地从事古典文学的研究工作，扎扎实实在打基础。这是极其需要的。但也有个别在“研究”的同志，从他的方法来看，是被资产阶级那一套“秘本”、“不易见的材料”、“权威”、“三十多年”、“细致的考证功夫”，等等吓住了，因而就跟了他跑，也去舍本逐末，也钻到故纸堆里，实际是被俘掳了。
    值得警惕啊！在受到“武训传”批判深刻的教育之后，我们有些同志对于工人阶级思想和资产阶级的思想界限还划分不清楚，对资产阶级反动思想还是嗅觉不灵。个别党员甚至还去支持那种资产阶级错误思想，或不敢批评那些所谓“权威”。这种腐朽的自由主义，实在离开马克思列宁主义原则很远，却和资产阶级的气味相近。检查起来，我们怎能不深深责备自己，怎能还不赶快警醒起来呢？
