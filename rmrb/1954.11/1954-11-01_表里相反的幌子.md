    A Façade of Contradictory Appearances
    U.S. President Eisenhower has recently made a series of statements regarding U.S. foreign policy. After Eisenhower delivered a speech in New York on the 20th, he gave another talk at a press conference in Washington on the 27th.
    A characteristic of Eisenhower's remarks is that he attempted to conceal the aggressive and war-preparatory nature of U.S. foreign policy, and spent a great deal of effort talking about how the U.S. desires peace. The purpose of making such remarks on the eve of the U.S. congressional elections is clearly to ease the anxieties of ordinary Americans about U.S. foreign policy and to win votes for Republican congressional candidates. At the same time, internationally, it is also to cope with the growing dissatisfaction and opposition of broad sections of the population in capitalist countries towards U.S. foreign policy.
    Although Eisenhower repeatedly spoke emptily of the U.S. "seeking a secure and just peace," when he talked about the actual content of U.S. foreign policy, he advocated the very "policy of strength" of aggression and war preparation that the U.S. is currently pursuing. This shows that Eisenhower's talk about seeking peace is nothing more than a façade of contradictory appearances.
    Eisenhower boasted about the recent record of the U.S. implementing a "policy of strength": signing an agreement in Europe to rearm West Germany within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization system, and signing the Southeast Asia Aggression Group Treaty in Asia. He actually described these as U.S. "efforts to pursue peace," while the nature of these measures, which seriously threaten peace and security in Europe and Asia, has already been recognized by fair-minded public opinion in Europe and Asia.
    Eisenhower hypocritically said that the U.S. "does not want to dominate others," but he immediately proudly talked about the "achievements" of U.S. armed intervention in Guatemala's internal affairs, thereby refuting his original argument.
    Eisenhower said that the U.S. "will keep existing avenues of negotiation open," and that the U.S. "will strive to seek agreements" on issues such as Germany and Korea. However, he openly expressed opposition to any meeting of the Soviet Union, the U.S., Britain, and France at the press conference, which is also a rejection of the recent Soviet proposal to convene a four-power meeting to discuss the German issue and European security issues. On the Korean issue, Eisenhower did not even indicate that the U.S. government would no longer reject the Chinese and Soviet proposals to convene a meeting to discuss the Korean issue soon.
    Eisenhower also continued to promote the U.S.'s so-called proposal to use atomic energy for peaceful needs, but he also said that the U.S. will intensify the atomic arms race. At the same time, Eisenhower repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. "must remain strong," "must maintain sufficient military strength," and other countries that follow the U.S. must also "unite" with the U.S. to strengthen their armed forces in order to maintain "the most powerful military force in history." From this, it can be seen that the Eisenhower government has no intention of abandoning aggression and war as its pursuit. (Xinhua News Agency)

    表里相反的幌子
    美国总统艾森豪威尔最近连续发表关于美国外交政策的言论。艾森豪威尔二十日在纽约发表演说以后，二十七日又在华盛顿记者招待会上发表谈话。
    艾森豪威尔这些言论的一个特点是，企图掩饰美国外交政策的侵略和准备战争的实质，而费了很多力气来谈论美国如何希望和平。在美国国会选举前夕发表这样的言论，其目的显然是想缓和美国普通人民对美国外交政策的不安，而为共和党国会议员候选人骗取选票。同时，对于国外来说，也是为了应付资本主义国家广大阶层对美国外交政策日益增长的不满和反对。
    艾森豪威尔尽管一再空谈美国“寻求的是安稳的公正的和平”，但是他在一谈到美国外交政策的实际内容时，鼓吹的却完全是美国正在实行着的侵略和准备战争的“实力政策”的一套。这就说明了艾森豪威尔关于寻求和平的谈论，不过是一种表里相反的幌子。
    艾森豪威尔吹嘘美国实行“实力政策”最近的记录：在欧洲签订了在北大西洋集团体系内重新武装西德的协议，在亚洲签订了东南亚侵略集团条约。他竟然把这些说成是美国“追求和平的努力”，而这些措施严重威胁欧洲和亚洲和平和安全的性质，是已经为欧洲和亚洲各国公正舆论所公认的。
    艾森豪威尔伪善地说美国“不希望支配别人”，然而他马上得意地谈到美国武装干涉危地马拉内政的“成就”，从而推翻了自己原来的论调。
    艾森豪威尔说美国“将使现有的谈判途径保持洞开”，美国在德国、朝鲜等问题上“将努力寻求协议”。但是，他在记者招待会上却公然表示反对最近举行苏、美、英、法四国的任何会议，这也就是拒绝苏联最近关于召开四国会议来讨论德国问题和欧洲安全问题的建议。在朝鲜问题上，艾森豪威尔甚至没有表明美国政府将不再拒绝中国和苏联关于最近召开讨论朝鲜问题会议的建议。
    艾森豪威尔还继续鼓吹美国的所谓利用原子能为和平需要服务的建议，不过他又说美国将加紧进行原子军备竞赛。同时，艾森豪威尔一再强调，美国“必须保持强大”，“必须维持足够的军事实力”，其他追随美国的国家也必须和美国
  “团结一致”加强武装力量，以保持“历史上最强大的军事力量”。从这里就可以看出，艾森豪威尔政府并没有打算放弃以侵略和战争作为它追求的目标。　（新华社）
