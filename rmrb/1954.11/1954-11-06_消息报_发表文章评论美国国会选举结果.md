Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th. "Izvestia" published an article by Osipov commenting on the results of the US Congressional elections.

The article stated that the beginning stage of this year's election campaign was characterized by a new burst of war hysteria and McCarthyist hysteria. Almost all states have passed special laws supporting the infamous two-party system, making it difficult, even impossible, for independent or progressive candidates to qualify for the election. Shortly before the election, some states generally prohibited the activities of progressive organizations. However, despite this, the rulers of the United States today are still unable to obtain a vote of confidence from the people for their policies. The Washington "Star" said that the 1954 election was characterized by a sense of political dissatisfaction nationwide.

This nationwide political dissatisfaction has led to a decline in Republican influence. It is natural for voters to vote for the opposition party to express their negative attitude towards the ruling party. The defeat suffered by the Republican Party primarily reflects the people's dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's policies, rather than reflecting an increase in the Democratic Party's prestige.

It should be particularly pointed out that the Republican leadership has been striving for favorable results, hoping to rely on this to proclaim that "the people support" their claims, especially in foreign policy.

However, this election shows that the US ruling clique's aggressive policies, which are hostile to the interests of peace-loving people of all countries and the task of ensuring world peace, do not have the support of the American people. The vast majority of American people, whether they went to vote or did not go to vote, are opposed to the political direction taken by the Republican government today in domestic and foreign affairs. The election results have shown that the American people do not support the fascist and aggressive policies being pursued by the US rulers.

    “消息报”发表文章评论美国国会选举结果
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“消息报”刊载了奥西波夫写的一篇文章，评论美国国会选举的结果。
    文章写道，今年的竞选运动的开始阶段的特点是，战争歇斯底里和麦卡锡主义歇斯底里的新的迸发。差不多各州都通过了支持声名狼藉的两党制度的特别法律，使独立的或进步的候选人难以、甚至不可能取得竞选资格。在选举举行之前不久，有些州普遍禁止进步组织的活动。然而，尽管如此，今天美国的统治者还是不能获得人民对他们的政策的信任票。华盛顿“明星报”说，一九五四年的选举的特点是全国范围内都有一种政治上的不满情绪。
    这种全国范围内的政治上的不满情绪已使得共和党影响下降。选民们投票支持反对党，借以表示他们对执政党的消极态度，这是很自然的。共和党遭到的失败首先反映出人民对共和党的政策的不满，而不是反映出民主党声望的增长。
    应当特别指出，共和党领导方面一直在努力争取有利的结果，希望靠这样来扬言“人民支持”他们的主张，特别是外交政策方面的主张。
    然而，这次选举表明，美国统治集团的同爱好和平的各国人民的利益和确保世界和平的任务为敌的侵略政策，得不到美国人民的支持。不论是前往投票的或是没有去投票的绝大多数美国人民，都是反对共和党政府今天在内政和外交方面采取的政治方针的。选举的结果已经表明，美国人民并不支持美国统治者正在实行的法西斯和侵略政策。
