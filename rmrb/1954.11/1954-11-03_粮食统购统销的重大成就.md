The facts of the unified purchase and supply of grain for nearly a year prove that this is an effective measure in our country's current grain production and consumption conditions to ensure people's livelihood and national construction, and it is an important step in realizing the country's general task during the transition period.

The result of the unified purchase and supply of grain is that the state has mastered sufficient grain sources, thereby ensuring supply. Thanks to the enthusiastic response of farmers to the state's call for unified purchase of grain, the state's grain purchase plan was overfulfilled during the grain year from July 1953 to June 1954, reaching 114.6 percent of the original planned grain purchase, equivalent to 1.7 times that of 1952 to 1953. During the same period, domestic market sales of grain also exceeded the original annual sales plan by 111.29 percent. During the same period, the grain inventory at the end of the period increased by 511.27 percent compared with the end-of-period inventory from 1952 to 1953.

Because of this, not only has the imbalance between grain purchase and sales in our country, which began in 1953, been changed, but the state has also obtained a certain amount of grain reserves. Increasing grain reserves is extremely necessary to ensure our country's socialist construction.

The unified purchase and supply of grain guarantees the grain supply in urban industrial and mining areas and economic crop areas. 1954 is the second year of the country's first five-year plan. With the development of economic construction, the population of urban industrial and mining areas has increased again. Due to the needs of national construction, economic crop areas have also expanded to a certain extent. Taking the planting area of oil crops such as peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, flax, and soybeans as an example, it has expanded by about 3 percent this year compared with last year. The increase in the population of urban industrial and mining areas and the expansion of the area of economic crops have directly increased the need for grain. It is conceivable that if the state had not implemented the unified purchase and supply of grain last year and the state did not have sufficient grain, it would be difficult to guarantee the grain supply in these areas, which would have brought extremely adverse effects to national construction. Now, because the state has implemented the unified purchase and supply of grain, this has effectively guaranteed the grain needs of these areas. During the spring plowing and sowing this year, some cotton farmers were afraid that they would not be able to buy grain and planned to reduce the planting of cotton and switch to planting grain. However, because the state generally carried out planned grain supply in the cotton areas, the cotton farmers received the necessary grain and relieved their worries. Therefore, the cotton field area across the country not only did not shrink, but expanded by 6 million mu compared with last year.

The role of the unified purchase and supply of grain in ensuring supply was particularly significant in the case of the unprecedented floods in our country this year. Farmers in disaster areas received timely grain supplies and relief, and no one starved to death. After Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui provinces suffered floods this summer, the state transferred a large amount of grain from Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces, and carried out large-scale adjustments within the provinces to supply the needs of the people in the disaster areas. Taking Hubei Province as an example, according to preliminary statistics in mid-July, the grain transferred and supported by various places was 140.27 million jin. To support the production of these areas, the state also transferred more than 170 million jin of late autumn crop seeds from North China, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and Northwest China. In the grain supply in the disaster areas, the supply units mostly adopted mobile supply and delivery to the countryside. Many people were very satisfied and said: "In the past, no one cared about disasters and famines, but now when disasters occur, rice is delivered to the door." The confidence of farmers in the disaster areas in production for self-rescue and overcoming disasters has been greatly improved. From their own personal experience, they have deeply realized the benefits of the unified purchase and supply of grain.

The unified purchase and supply of grain not only guarantees the supply, but also guarantees the rationality and stability of the supply price. The masses generally reflected: "Since the implementation of planned grain supply, we are not afraid of not being able to buy grain, and we are not afraid of rising grain prices." People call the grain purchase certificate issued by the people's government "three insurances", that is: stable grain prices, no longer worried about price increases is one insurance; no worry about not being able to buy grain, no longer queuing to buy is two insurance; no longer buying adulterated grain from private merchants is three insurance. Farmers in Guanting Township, Changge County, Henan Province, compared the stability of grain prices during the shortage of grain this year with the grain price fluctuations caused by private merchants' speculation last year, and the township's grain-deficient households reduced their losses by 130 million yuan. Especially in areas with major floods this year, grain prices have always been stable. An elderly woman in Yiyang City, Hunan Province, said: "I have lived for more than sixty years and have seen many floods. Except for this year, there has never been a time when rice prices did not rise with the water. The past and the present are really incomparable."

The unified purchase and supply of grain has powerfully promoted the socialist transformation of agriculture. Before the unified purchase and supply of grain, class differentiation began to occur in rural areas. After accumulating grain or other sideline income, some farmers not only hired long-term workers, lent money, and bought land, but also bought green seedlings, hoarded grain, and engaged in speculative business. The sayings "Horses don't get fat without night grass, farmers don't get rich without doing business," "It's easier to get rich in one year as a traveling merchant than in a hundred years as a farmer," and "Buying land is not as good as lending money, lending money is not as good as hoarding grain" were widely popular in rural areas. As a result, some farmers, in order to engage in speculative business, even allowed the millet to turn yellow in the fields without harvesting it; some even sold part of their land and livestock to hoard grain. Because of this, the socialist atmosphere in rural areas was thin, and some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups were dispersed, and some simply broke up.

Since the winter of 1953, due to the widespread publicity and education on the general line of the transition period in rural areas, and the implementation of the unified purchase and supply of grain, the socialist consciousness of farmers has been improved, new changes have taken place in class relations in the vast rural areas, the poor peasants (including the new middle peasants) are excited and active, and have become the backbone of the cooperative movement, the middle peasants are more inclined to socialism, the rich peasants are economically restricted, and politically begin to be isolated. Taking the socialist road has become the center of rural public opinion. The unified purchase and supply of grain, in an important aspect, cut off the connection between farmers and capitalism, eliminated the free grain market, and farmers can not only avoid being exploited by being pressured when selling and paying high prices when buying, but also, by accepting socialist leadership, can produce with peace of mind and are more conducive to the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. During the tense period of unified grain purchase in the spring of 1954, the number of agricultural production cooperatives across the country increased from more than 14,000 to more than 90,000, and by August of this year, it had increased to more than 100,000, and the number of mutual aid groups had also increased significantly. Rural supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and handicraft production cooperation have also developed to varying degrees during this period. After the implementation of unified grain purchase in Shandong Province, 1.6 million farmers successively joined the supply and marketing cooperatives. During the grain purchase period, 1,748 credit cooperatives were established in 39 counties in Hubei Province. This shows that the position and leadership of the socialist economy in rural areas are growing stronger and stronger, which is also conducive to further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

The unified purchase and supply of grain has also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers. The state only purchases the surplus grain of farmers, which farmers will sell sooner or later. The prices of unified purchase and supply by the state are reasonable. The base price of grain purchased in 1953 was about 8 percent higher than that in 1952, and farmers across the country could get about 3 trillion yuan more in benefits. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives also supply farmers with necessary production and living materials at reasonable prices. For example, in the three months from November 1953 to January 1954, the total value of production materials supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives to rural areas exceeded three times that of the same period in 1952. In addition, the "preferential grain sales savings" held by the People's Bank of China in rural areas across the country have also greatly facilitated the accumulation of production funds by farmers. According to statistics at the end of January this year, the grain sales funds deposited by farmers across the country reached more than 2.8 trillion yuan. If this deposit is calculated at an average of three months, it can earn 126 billion yuan in interest, which can buy 100,000 Liberation-style waterwheels. Farmers in Shan County, Henan Province, described the changes brought about by the unified purchase and supply of grain as "seven more," "four fast," and "three less." "Seven more" are: more livestock, more farm tools, more credit, more new houses, more people adding waterwheels for watering, more use of fertilizer, and more production cooperatives. "Four fast" are: fast sales of cloth, chemical fertilizers, building materials, and cart axle pins. "Three less" are: less usury, less land purchase, and less idlers and loafers.

The above facts irrefutably prove that the unified purchase and supply of grain is an important policy of the state during the transition period, and it is an indispensable and important measure. There is no doubt about this. However, it must also be pointed out that the unified purchase and supply of grain is a very heavy and complex task, and it is in its initial stage, with a lack of experience. Therefore, in actual work, many shortcomings have also occurred. The main ones are: in the unified purchase of grain, some places have engaged in some acts of coercion and commandism; at the same time, there have been cases where more was purchased when less should have been purchased and less was purchased when more should have been purchased. In the unified supply, some places have experienced phenomena such as insufficient or excessive supply, and untimely supply; and the supply procedures are too cumbersome, affecting mass production, and causing mass dissatisfaction. In some places, the combination of unified purchase and unified supply is not enough, and they are busy with purchasing and neglect the supply. These shortcomings must be corrected in the future.

This year's large-scale autumn grain unified purchase work has begun. Let us carry forward the achievements in past work, overcome the shortcomings in work, make persistent efforts, and continue to work hard to strive for greater victory in this year's grain unified purchase and supply work.

    粮食统购统销的重大成就
    康伟中
    粮食统购统销工作将近一年来的事实证明：这是我国在目前粮食生产和消费的条件下，保障人民生活和国家建设的行之有效的措施，是实现国家过渡时期总任务的一个重要步骤。
    粮食统购统销的结果，使国家掌握了足够的粮源，从而保证了供应。由于农民热烈响应了国家统购粮食的号召，在一九五三年七月至一九五四年六月的粮食年度内，超额完成了国家粮食的收购计划，达到了原定粮食计划收购数的百分之一一四点六，相当于一九五二年至一九五三年度的一点七倍。同期国内市场销售粮食亦超过全年原定销售计划的百分之一一一点二九。同期期末的粮食库存比一九五二年至一九五三年度期末库存增加了百分之五一一点二七。
    由于这样，不但改变了从一九五三年开始的我国粮食购销不平衡的局面，并且使国家获到了一定的粮食后备。增加粮食后备，对保障我国的社会主义建设是万分必要的。
    粮食统购统销保证了城市工矿区和经济作物地区的粮食供应。一九五四年是国家第一个五年计划建设的第二年，随着经济建设的发展，城市工矿区的人口又有增加。由于国家建设的需要，经济作物区也有了一定的扩大。仅以全国油料作物花生、油菜、芝麻、胡麻、大豆的播种面积来说，今年就比去年大约扩大了百分之三。城市工矿区人口增加和经济作物区面积扩大，这都直接增加了粮食的需要。可以设想，如果国家不在去年实行粮食统购统销，国家不掌握足够的粮食，就很难保证这些地区的粮食供应，这对国家建设就将带来极为不利的影响。现在由于国家实行了粮食统购统销，这就有效地保障了这些地区的粮食需要。今年春耕播种时，有些棉农怕买不到粮食，准备少种棉花，改种粮食，但由于国家在棉区普遍开展了粮食计划供应，棉农得到必需的粮食，解除了他们的顾虑，因而全国棉田面积不但没有缩小，反而比去年扩大了六百万亩。
    粮食统购统销对保障供应的作用，在今年我国遭受近百余年来未有的水灾的情况下，表现得特别显著。各地灾区农民及时得到了粮食供应和救济，没有发生饿死人的现象。今年夏季湖北、湖南和安徽等省遭受水灾后，国家就从四川、广东、广西等省调运了大批粮食，并从各省内部进行了大规模的调剂，供应了灾区人民的需要。拿湖北省来说，到七月中旬初步统计，由各地调拨支援的粮食就有一亿四千零二十七万斤。为支持这些地区的生产，国家又从华北、内蒙古、东北、西北等地调运了晚秋作物种籽一亿七千多万斤。在灾区的粮食供应中，供应单位大都采取了流动供应、送货下乡的办法，许多群众很满意地说：“过去灾荒无人管，现在受灾有米送上门。”灾区农民生产自救和战胜灾荒的信心大大提高了，他们从自己的切身经验中，深深认识到粮食统购统销的好处。
    粮食统购统销不仅保障了供应，并且保证了供应价格的合理和稳定。群众普遍反映：“实行粮食计划供应以来，一不怕买不到粮食，二不怕粮价上涨”。人们把人民政府发的购粮证称为“三保险”，即：粮价稳定，不再担心涨价是一保险；不愁买不到粮，不再排队抢购是二保险；不再买私商掺杂掺次的粮食是三保险。河南省长葛县官亭乡农民，把今年青黄不接时粮价的平稳跟去年由于私商投机造成粮价波动作了对比，全乡缺粮户减少了一亿三千万元的损失。特别是今年水灾较大的地区，粮价始终平稳。湖南省益阳市一个老年妇女说：“我活了六十多岁，涨水看到过多少回，除了今年，没有一次不是米价跟着水一起涨的。过去和现在，真是不能比。”
    粮食统购统销有力地促进了农业的社会主义改造。在粮食统购统销以前，农村阶级开始有了分化，有些农民在积累了粮食或其他副业收入之后，不仅雇长工、放债、买土地，而且买青苗、囤粮食和做投机生意。“马无夜草不肥，农不经商不富”、
  “一年能发江湖客，百年难发种田人”和“买田不如放债，放债不如囤粮”等说法在农村中是广为流行的。结果，有的农民为了做投机生意，竟听任谷子黄在田里不割；有的甚至卖掉一部分土地和耕畜去囤积粮食。由于这样，农村中的社会主义空气稀薄，有些农业生产合作社、互助组涣散了，有的干脆散了伙。
    从一九五三年冬季以来，由于在农村普遍进行了关于过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，并实行了粮食的统购统销，农民的社会主义觉悟提高了，广大农村中的阶级关系有了新的变化，贫农（包括新中农在内）兴奋积极，成为合作化运动的骨干，中农更加倾向社会主义，富农在经济上受到了限制，政治上开始被孤立，走社会主义的道路已成为乡村舆论的中心。而粮食统购统销，更在一个重要方面割断了农民和资本主义的联系，消灭了粮食自由市场，农民不但可以不再吃出卖时被压价、买进时出高价的亏，并且由于接受了社会主义的领导，更可以安心生产，更有利于农村互助合作运动的发展。就在一九五四年春天粮食统购紧张时期，全国农业生产合作社由一万四千多个发展到了九万多个，到今年八月止，已经发展到十万多个，互助组也增加了很多。农村供销合作、信用合作和手工业生产合作在这个期间也有了不同程度的发展。山东省在实行粮食统购以后有一百六十万农民陆续参加了供销合作社，湖北省三十九个县在购粮期间成立了信用合作社一千七百四十八个。这就说明，社会主义经济在农村中的阵地和领导力量是越来越大了，从而也有利于进一步巩固工农联盟。
    粮食统购统销也大大地鼓舞了农民的生产积极性。国家统购的只是农民的余粮，这些余粮，农民迟早是要卖的。国家统购和统销的价格是合理的。一九五三年粮食统购的基价比一九五二年约提高百分之八，全国农民可以多得到三万亿元左右的利益。国营商业和供销合作社还以合理的价格供应农民必需的生产和生活资料，如一九五三年十一月到一九五四年一月的三个月内，全国供销合作社供应农村的生产资料总值超过了一九五二年同期的三倍以上。此外，中国人民银行在全国农村举办的“优待售粮储蓄”，也大大便利了农民积累生产资金。据今年一月底统计，全国农民存入银行的售粮款达二万八千多亿元，这笔存款如按平均三个月计算，可得利息一千二百六十亿元，可买解放式水车十万部。河南省陕县农民形容粮食统购统销带来的变化是“七多”、“四快”、“三少”。“七多”是：牲口多、农具多、信贷多、新房子多、添水车浇地的多、用肥料多、生产合作社增多。“四快”是：布、化学肥料、建筑材料、车脚车轴销的快。“三少”是：高利贷少了、买土地少了、二流子懒汉少了。
    以上事实无可辩驳地证明：粮食统购统销是国家在过渡时期的一项重要政策，是一项不可缺少的重要措施，这是无可怀疑的。但也必须指出，粮食统购统销是一项非常繁重、复杂的工作，且事属初办，经验缺乏，因此，在实际工作中，也曾发生了不少缺点。主要是：在粮食统购中，有些地方发生了一些强迫命令的行为；同时也发生了该少购而多购和该多购而少购的情况。在统销中，有些地方发生了供应过少过多、供应不及时的现象；并且供应手续过于繁琐、影响群众生产，引起群众不满。有些地方统购和统销结合不够，忙于收购而放松了供应。这些缺点都必须在今后加以改正。
    今年大规模秋季粮食统购工作已开始了。让我们发扬过去工作中的成绩，克服工作中的缺点，再接再厉，继续努力，为争取今年的粮食统购统销工作的更大胜利而奋斗。
