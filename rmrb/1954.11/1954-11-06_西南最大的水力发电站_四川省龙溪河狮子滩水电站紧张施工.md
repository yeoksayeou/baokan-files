    The Largest Hydropower Station in Southwest China
    Tense Construction at the Shizitan Hydropower Station on the Longxi River in Sichuan Province

    The largest hydropower station in Southwest China, the Shizitan Hydropower Station on the Longxi River in Sichuan, has now entered the first phase of tense construction.

    The main projects of the Shizitan Hydropower Station include: water diversion tunnels, spillways, drainage culverts, storage plant substations, etc. The excavation of earth and stone for each project is in the hundreds of thousands of cubic meters. The entire project is to be completed in two dry seasons, and it is expected that some electricity can be generated by 1956. After the hydropower station generates electricity, the cost of industrial electricity in industrial areas such as Chongqing will be reduced by about 25% compared to the present.

    The Longxi River Hydropower Station started construction on August 1st this year. Now, light railways, timber processing plants, quarries, compressor plants, and shipping docks have been completed successively in October, and various auxiliary factories have begun production. With the arrival of the dry season, the crucial drainage culvert project is undergoing large-scale concrete pouring. The dam and water diversion tunnel projects also started on November 1st. The entire construction site has entered the first phase of tense construction.

    Participating in this huge construction project are embankment construction teams from the Northeast, workers and engineering technicians from Southwest, East China, and other regions. To strive to "send electricity to factories as soon as possible," they are enthusiastically launching labor competitions and constantly creating new records. The "drilling side-hole blasting method" and "hollow pebble cannon" created by the workers have saved manpower and explosives, improved work efficiency, and enabled many work areas to complete their tasks ahead of schedule.

    西南最大的水力发电站
    四川省龙溪河狮子滩水电站紧张施工
    西南最大的水力发电站——四川龙溪河狮子滩水电站，现已进入第一期紧张施工阶段。
    狮子滩水电站主要工程有：引水隧洞、溢洪道、排水涵洞、贮厂房变电站等。每一项工程开挖的土石方都在数十万方以上。全部工程要在两个枯水季完成，预计到一九五六年就可以发出一部分电来。水电站发电后，将使重庆等地工业区的工业用电的成本，比现在降低百分之二十五左右。
    龙溪河水电站在今年八月一日开工，现在，轻便铁道、木材加工厂、采石厂、压缩机厂和起运码头等工程，在十月份先后竣工，各附属工厂已开始生产。随着枯水季的到来，带有关键性的排水涵洞工程，正在大规模进行水泥浇筑工作。拦河坝、引水隧洞工程也在十一月一日开工。整个工地进入了第一期紧张施工阶段。
    参加这一巨大建设工程的有来自东北的筑堤队，有西南、华东等地区的工人和工程技术人员，他们为争取“早日把电送到工厂”，热烈展开劳动竞赛，不断创造新纪录。工人们创造的“钻边孔爆炸法”和“空心石子炮”，节省了人力、炸药，提高了工作效率，使许多工区的任务提前完成。  （邓中石）
