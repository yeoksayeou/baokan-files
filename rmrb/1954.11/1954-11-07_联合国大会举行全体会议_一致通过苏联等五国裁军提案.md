Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations General Assembly, at its plenary session on the 4th, unanimously adopted the proposal on arms reduction and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction put forward by Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

    The five-nation proposal had already undergone detailed discussion in the Political Committee, so representatives only made brief remarks at the plenary session.

    French representative Moch expressed great satisfaction with the achievements made and hoped for a victorious resolution of the disarmament issue. He said that this hope is based on the fact that this time we are suggesting one path, not two. Another reason for this hope is that everyone understands that the Cold War and the arms race can only lead to a terrible atomic war.

    British representative Dixon also expressed satisfaction with the agreement reached in the Political Committee, while also pointing out the difficulties that still need to be overcome to finally resolve this issue. The British representative suggested that the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission work in London, and he also said that the British government needs some time to study the different viewpoints.

    Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet delegation attaches great importance to the fact that the current draft resolution is put forward in the name of five countries and was unanimously adopted. In addition to provisions of a procedural nature, this draft resolution also includes very important provisions of a political nature. It instructs the Disarmament Commission to again seek extremely important agreements on mutually coordinated proposals for inclusion in a draft international disarmament convention. It instructs the Disarmament Commission to seek acceptable solutions to the disarmament issue. It can be seen that this draft resolution includes guiding instructions on how to proceed with work to complete this important political task.

    Vyshinsky went on to say that, of course, there are many difficulties ahead, but initial progress has been made, and this progress should perhaps be called historic. The Soviet delegation is approaching the tasks before us from a firm position of seeking agreements acceptable to all countries. The Soviet Union has taken some steps to bring differing views on contentious issues closer together. We naturally hope that the representatives of Western countries will also take steps that can promote the achievement of agreements that are in our common interest.

    Representatives from Sweden, India, and the United States also made brief remarks.

    The plenary session then unanimously adopted the resolution on arms reduction and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction put forward by Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The General Assembly also passed a second resolution put forward by the five countries by a vote of fifty-seven in favor and one against (Kuomintang elements), which stipulated that India's proposal should be submitted to the Disarmament Commission for consideration.

    联合国大会举行全体会议
    一致通过苏联等五国裁军提案
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会在四日举行的全体会议上一致通过了加拿大、法国、苏联、英国和美国提出的关于裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的提案。
    五国提案已经在政治委员会经过详细的讨论，因此代表们在全体会议上都只作了简短的发
  言。
    法国代表莫克对已经取得的成果表示十分满意，并希望裁军问题获得胜利的解决。他说，这种希望是以这样一个事实为基础的，就是这一次我们建议的是一条道路，而不是两条道路。抱这种希望的另一理由是，大家都了解冷战和军备竞赛只能导向可怖的原子战争。
    英国代表狄克逊也对在政治委员会达成的协议表示满意，同时也指出了要最后解决这个问题还需要克服的困难。英国代表建议联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦工作，他又说，英国政府需要一定的时间来研究不同的观点。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基指出，苏联代表团十分重视这一个事实，就是目前的决议草案是以五国的名义提出，而且是一致通过的。除了属于程序性质的规定外，这个决议草案还包括十分重要的政治性质的规定。它责成裁军委员会重新设法对相互配合的建议达成极端重要的协议，以便列入一项国际裁军公约草案中。它责成裁军委员会寻求裁军问题的可以接受的解决办法。由此可见，这个决议草案包括了关于如何进行工作以完成这个重要的政治任务的指导性指示。
    维辛斯基接着说，当然前面还有许多困难，但是已得到了初步的进展，这种进展也许应该称为历史性的进展。苏联代表团是从谋求各国都能接受的协议的坚定立场出发来对待我们所面临的任务的。苏联已采取了一些步骤来促使在争论中的问题上的不同观点趋于接近。我们自然盼望西方国家代表们也将采取能够促使达成符合我们的共同利益的协议的步骤。
    瑞典、印度和美国的代表也都作了简短的发言。
    全体会议接着一致通过了加拿大、法国、苏联、英国和美国所提出的关于裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决议。大会并以五十七票赞成，一票反对（国民党分子）通过了这五国提出的第二个决议，其中规定把印度的建议交给裁军委员会审议。
