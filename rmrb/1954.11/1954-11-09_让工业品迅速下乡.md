    Let Industrial Products Rapidly Go to the Countryside

    At present, autumn harvests are successively coming to market. In addition to actively purchasing various agricultural and sideline products in accordance with state plans to fulfill the state's unified purchase and acquisition tasks, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives must also quickly transport industrial products suitable for rural needs to the countryside and make them available to farmers in order to meet the needs of farmers and support the smooth progress of the purchase of agricultural and sideline products.

    This year's work of bringing industrial products to the countryside places particularly important responsibilities on state-owned commercial departments. This is not only because the vast majority of industrial products needed by the broad masses of farmers are controlled by state-owned commercial departments, but also because after the division of business scope between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in urban and rural areas, the industrial products needed by supply and marketing cooperatives are mainly supplied by state-owned commerce. However, the operations of state-owned commerce are still far from keeping up with the needs of work development. In general, the time for bringing industrial products to the countryside this year is a bit late. There have been cases where, just as the peak season began, many commodities were stopped in medium-sized cities and secondary wholesale stations, and were not quickly and promptly transported to wholesale institutions close to sales locations, so that grassroots stores and cooperatives could pick up the goods. For example, in August, the commodities stored by the Zhangjiakou branch of the state-owned department store accounted for 70.95 percent of its inventory, while the commodities stored by the eleven directly affiliated county stores supplied by the Zhangjiakou branch accounted for only 29.05 percent; the commodities stored by the Tangshan branch of the state-owned department store accounted for 63.19 percent of its inventory, while the nine county stores accounted for only 36.81 percent. Although this situation has begun to change, and most commodities have been successively placed in county-level stores, the work of fully utilizing various commercial channels of different economic components to quickly send industrial products to the countryside and supply them to farmers is still not adapting to the current needs of farmers. Furthermore, not enough work has been done to actively introduce and promote various industrial products, especially those with sufficient supply, to the broad masses of farmers in combination with inventory and supply situations, so that these industrial products have not reached the hands of farmers in a timely manner. This is the main obstacle to bringing industrial products to the countryside at present. If this obstacle is not quickly eliminated, it will not only hinder the entry of industrial products into the countryside and affect the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, but also affect the arrangement of industrial production next year.

    The state's investment in rural areas in the fourth quarter of this year is very large, the time is relatively concentrated, and the quantity of industrial products needed by the broad masses of farmers is also very large; after the unified sale of cotton cloth, the need for other industrial products by farmers will inevitably increase. Therefore, vigorously promoting industrial products and meeting the needs of the broad masses of farmers in all aspects can not only effectively support purchasing work, withdraw currency, stabilize prices, expand urban-rural material exchanges, and promote industrial production development, but also further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, resolutely overcoming shortcomings, clearly recognizing the political and economic significance of bringing industrial products to the countryside, quickly organizing the entry of industrial products into the countryside, supplying industrial products to farmers, and meeting the needs of farmers as much as possible have become important tasks for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce.

    In order to expand the entry of industrial products into the countryside, the leading organs of state-owned commercial departments at all levels must currently step up another inspection of the commodity layout, and continue to put commodities that have not yet been decentralized but can be decentralized into grassroots wholesale institutions; and they should urge state-owned grassroots stores and help cooperatives actively purchase goods. In order to do this work well, it is necessary to explain to the leading cadres of state-owned commercial companies that after the division of business scope between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in urban and rural areas, the responsibility of state-owned grassroots wholesale institutions has become increasingly heavy. They should not only help them purchase goods quickly, but also help them solve the problems of insufficient personnel, warehouses, and transportation tools caused by the decentralization of large quantities of commodities. In order to implement the principle of giving priority to supplying industrial products suitable for rural areas to rural areas, all localities should, on the basis of the rural supply work last year, combine new situations and, through specific commodity analysis and calculation, resolutely transfer commodities that meet the needs of farmers (paying attention to their variety, specifications, and quantity) from cities to rural areas in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers.

    In order to expand the promotion of industrial products, it is necessary to conduct a concrete analysis of the commodities. That is to say, for commodities supplied under the state plan, the sales tasks must be completed in accordance with the state's sales plan, and attention should be paid to customers' preferences for the variety, color, and specifications of these commodities, and the organization and supply of the sources of these commodities should be strengthened, and the bureaucracy that may arise in planned supply should be strictly prevented. For commodities with balanced supply and demand and large inventories, we must actively promote and sell them, and we should actively promote and sell new commodities and strengthen the role of guiding consumption. As long as we strengthen the publicity work for new commodities, farmers are willing to buy them. Only in this way can we expand sales and supply farmers with more industrial products. In order to expand the promotion of new commodities, state-owned stores should, together with cooperatives, open more temple fair-style industrial product sales exhibitions in agricultural product distribution markets, where samples of the commodities are displayed to introduce them to farmers. As for the idea that the sales task cannot be completed without three or four kinds of "brand-name" commodities, it is essentially an idea that is irresponsible to the needs of people's lives and irresponsible to production, and it must be quickly corrected.

    The further integration of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is not only the key to doing a good job in the unified purchase and acquisition of agricultural products, but also the key to doing a good job in the supply of materials to rural areas. After the division of business scope between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in urban and rural areas, the industrial products operated by grassroots cooperatives are mostly purchased from state-owned stores; cooperative commerce has completely become the main reliance of state-owned commerce for transporting industrial products to rural areas. In addition to preparing a sufficient supply of commodities for grassroots cooperatives, state-owned stores must also actively help grassroots cooperatives expand the supply of industrial products. In the past few years, the combination of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in the supply of industrial products has gradually become closer. However, after the division of business scope between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce this year, there have been disconnections to varying degrees, which must be quickly improved. As far as state-owned commerce is concerned, leaders at all levels of state-owned commerce must strengthen education for employees, so that they can better rely on cooperatives, strive to meet the purchase requirements of cooperatives in specific business, and help cooperatives expand their operating varieties. Whatever the cooperatives need, state-owned county-level stores must fully supply them, or replenish and allocate them to secondary wholesale stations. Internal exchange meetings between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should be held frequently; more industrial product variety exhibitions should be held to invite cooperative business staff to visit; commodity catalogs should be issued frequently to introduce commodities. As far as supply and marketing cooperatives are concerned, they must also recognize that promoting industrial products is by no means just a matter for state-owned commerce, and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively and proactively purchase goods from state-owned commerce and expand the promotion of industrial products.

    In the current expansion of urban-rural material exchanges, urban retailers and peddlers and traveling vendors between urban and rural areas are still a force. We must organize this force under the contact, guidance, and supervision of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, so that they can serve the expansion of urban-rural material exchanges, and carry out socialist transformation on them through wholesale business. However, at present, some cadres in state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity and importance of this work. Some people are afraid of trouble, and some people put the expansion of sales and the strengthening of the utilization, restriction, and transformation of private retailers and peddlers in urban and rural areas in opposition to each other. These erroneous ideas must also be corrected in a timely manner.

    In order to expand commodity circulation and quickly transport industrial products to the countryside, it is currently necessary to strengthen the development of wholesale business with private merchants and widely convene primary market material exchange meetings with the participation of private merchants under the premise of close integration between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. Only by fully utilizing all commercial forces that can be utilized will it be conducive to the development of socialist transformation and conducive to the expansion of urban-rural material exchanges.

    Party committees at all levels, while vigorously leading the unified purchase and acquisition of agricultural products, must immediately strengthen the leadership of the supply of materials to rural areas, which is the guarantee that industrial products can smoothly and unhinderedly enter the countryside quickly.

    让工业品迅速下乡
    目前秋收作物已陆续登场，国营商业部门和供销合作社除了应该按照国家计划，积极收购各种农产品和副产品，完成国家的统购、收购任务以外，还必须把适合农村需要的工业品迅速输送到农村和农民见面，以满足农民的需要，并支持农产品和副产品收购工作的顺利进行。
    今年的工业品下乡工作，国营商业部门担负着特别重大的责任。这不仅因为广大农民所需要的工业品货源，有极大部分已为国营商业部门掌握；并且因为国营商业和合作社商业就城乡经营范围作了分工之后，供销合作社所需要的工业品，主要是由国营商业调拨供应。但目前国营商业的经营还远赶不上工作发展的需要。今年工业品下乡的时间一般来说是迟了一些。曾经有过这样的情况：正当旺季开始，许多商品被停留在中等城市和二级批发站，没有迅速及时地运送到接近销地的批发机构，以便基层商店和合作社去取货。例如国营百货公司张家口分公司八月份所存的商品占它的库存的百分之七十点九五，而由张家口分公司负责供应的十一个直属县商店所存的商品只占百分之二十九点○五；国营百货公司唐山分公司所存的商品占它的库存百分之六十三点一九，而九个县商店所存的商品只占百分之三十六点八一。现在这种情况虽然开始有了改变，大部分商品已络续放到县级商店，但对充分利用各种不同经济成份的商业沟道，把工业品迅速送到农村，供应到农民手里的工作，还不能适应农民当前的需要；并且对结合库存及货源情况，把各类工业品特别是货源充足的工业品，积极地向广大农民介绍推销的工作也还做得很不够，以致这些工业品没有及时到达农民手里。这是当前工业品下乡的主要障碍。这种障碍，如果不迅速加以消除，不仅要妨碍工业品的下乡，影响农产品和副产品的收购，同时将影响明年工业生产的安排。
    今年第四季度国家在农村的投放数字很大，时间也较集中，广大农民对工业品需要的数量也很大；在棉布统销以后，农民对于其他工业品的需要又必然增加。因此，大力推销工业品，从各个方面来满足广大农民的需要，不仅可以有效地支援收购工作，回笼货币，稳定物价，扩大城乡物资交流，促使工业生产发展，并且也会进一步巩固工农联盟。所以，坚决克服缺点，明确认识工业品下乡的政治意义和经济意义，迅速组织工业品下乡，把工业品供应到农民手里，尽可能满足农民需要，就成为国营商业和合作社商业当前的重要任务。
    为了扩大工业品下乡，国营商业部门各级领导机关目前还必须加紧对商品摆布情况进行一次检查，把目前没有下放而可以下放的商品继续不断地放到基层批发机构中去；并应督促国营基层商店和帮助合作社积极进货。为了做好这一工作，必须向国营商业各公司领导干部说明：国营商业和合作社商业就城乡经营范围分工以后，国营基层批发机构的责任日益加重了，不仅应该帮助它们迅速进货，还必须帮助它们解决因大批商品下放而引起的人员、仓库以及运输工具不足等问题。为了贯彻适合农村的工业品优先供应农村的方针，各地应在去年农村供应工作已有的基础上，结合新的情况，通过具体商品的分析计算，把合乎农民需要的商品（注意它们的品种、规格和数量），坚决从城市调到农村，以满足广大农民的需要。
    为了扩大工业品的推销，必须对商品进行具体的分析。这就是说，对于国家计划供应的商品，必须按照国家的销售计划完成销售任务，并应注意顾客对这些商品的品种、花色、规格的喜好，加强对这些商品货源的组织工作和供应工作，严格防止计划供应中可能产生的官僚主义。对于供求平衡、库存较多的商品，更要积极宣传和推销，并且应该积极宣传和推销新的商品，加强指导消费的作用。只要我们加强新商品的宣传工作，农民是乐意购买的。只有这样，才能扩大销售，才能供应农民更多的工业品。为了扩大新商品的推销，国营商店应同合作社一道，在农产品集散市场，多开庙会式的工业品出售展览会，在这些会上把商品的样品都摆列出来，向农民介绍。至于那种认为没有三、四种“名牌”商品，就不能完成销售任务的思想，实质上是对人民生活需要不负责任、对生产不负责任的思想，必须迅速纠正。
    国营商业和合作社商业的进一步结合，不但是做好农产品统购、收购工作的关键，也是做好农村物资供应工作的关键。在国营商业和合作社商业就经营范围作了城乡分工以后，基层合作社经营的工业品已大部向国营商店进货；合作社商业完全成为国营商业对农村输送工业品的主要依靠。国营商店除了必须准备充足的商品供应基层合作社以外，还必须积极帮助基层合作社展开工业品的供应工作。几年来国营商业和合作社商业在工业品供应工作中，双方的结合逐步密切起来。但今年国营商业和合作社商业就经营范围作了城乡分工后，在不同程度上曾经出现了脱节的现象，这必须迅速改进。就国营商业来说，国营商业各级领导必须加强对职工进行教育，要他们更好地依靠合作社，在具体业务中，努力满足合作社的进货要求，并帮助合作社扩大经营品种。凡是合作社需要的，国营的县级商店必须充分予以供应，或向二级批发站补充调拨。国营商业和合作社商业的内部交流会要经常召开；工业品品种展览会要更多举办，邀请合作社营业员参观；要经常发商品目录，介绍商品。就供销合作社来说，也必须认识，推销工业品决不只是国营商业的事情，供销合作社应积极地主动地向国营商业进货，扩大工业品的推销。
    在目前扩大城乡物资交流中，城市的零售商和城乡之间的小贩、货郎担仍是一个力量。我们必须在国营商业和合作社商业的联系、指导和监督下，把这批力量组织起来，使他们为扩大城乡物资交流服务，并通过批购业务，对他们进行社会主义改造。但目前在国营商业、供销合作社部门的某些干部中，对这一工作的必要性和重要性还认识不够。有些人怕麻烦，有些人把扩大推销和加强对私营零售商和城乡间的小贩的利用、限制、改造对立起来，这些错误思想也必须及时纠正。
    为了扩大商品流通，迅速输送工业品下乡，目前必须在国营商业和合作社商业紧密结合的前提下，加强开展对私商的批购业务，广泛召开吸收私商参加的初级市场物资交流会。只有充分利用一切可以利用的商业力量，这样才有利于社会主义改造事业的发展，有利于城乡物资交流的扩大。
    各级党委在大力领导农产品统购、收购工作的同时，必须立即加强对农村物资供应工作的领导，这是工业品能够通畅无阻地迅速下乡的保证。
