    A Young Man in Qaidam
    ——"First Entry into Qaidam" Poem Series Three
    Li Ji
    In our glorious and brilliant lives,
    There are so many youths cast in gold.
    They swim in the ocean like fish,
    They fly to mountains above the snowline like eagles.
    Like a rocket-propelled grenade just leaving the launcher,
    They rush forward, simple and brave.
    Their enthusiasm can turn steel into juice,
    Their will can transform severe cold into spring.
    You've seen him on yachts on the North Sea,
    His songs have also floated before the Great Goose Pagoda.
    On that night of revelry in Tiananmen Square,
    How many girls praised his dancing.
    I met him in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai,
    At this time, he was already a petroleum geology exploration team member.
    His face has been tanned black, and his hands have become rough,
    He has been working in the basin for a full six months.
    People working in the basin all know him,
    Like in college, he is still the Youth League branch secretary.
    He welcomes us with the unique enthusiasm of a geologist,
    Just like those gray-haired people exploring the mysteries of nature.
    Although he specially added a jacket over his worn work clothes
    to welcome relatives from within the pass;
    However, this navy blue "formal attire" of his
    is also closely connected with this patch and that patch.
    Like a fully armed national defense soldier,
    He carries a barometer and a small compass all day long.
    The dark green backpack and his small hammer,
    Never left his side even when sleeping.
    On the way to explore water sources at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains,
    We confided our thoughts in the jeep:
    There isn't a single person to be seen in the basin as vast as the ocean,
    Because of the lack of water, it's difficult to even see birds and animals for days.
    Every day we have to experience the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter,
    Wearing a leather jacket at midnight, and stripping down to a shirt by noon.
    Having just left Beijing, and immediately coming to the basin,
    He was indeed not used to this outdoor life of climbing mountains all day long.
    It was the majestic Kunlun Mountains that eliminated his fatigue,
    It was the golden oil sand that ignited his enthusiasm.
    The motherland's Qaidam is simply a treasure bowl,
    Working here brings glory and happiness to accompany you.
    Whenever he sits at the small table with a lit candle filling out reports,
    Those figures soaked in the scent of petroleum will make him revel;
    He seems to see rows of footprints on the Gobi,
    And large and thick oil pipelines have already been installed.
    Arduous labor can best temper one's will,
    What supports him is the belief in finding new oil fields for the motherland.
    He has begun to get used to the life of washing dishes and feet with sand,
    And he has also learned to not drink water for a few days and smoke a cigarette for three days.
    Everything he said was so truthful,
    Only one thing he deceived me.
    He said that he had never been sick in the basin,
    The doctor comrade said this was his lie.
    On the day of the detailed survey of the geological structure of the oil sand mountain,
    He insisted on working vigorously until the sun set.
    He lost his way on the sea-like beach,
    Like a wild horse, he slept on the Gobi for one night.
    The pitch-black night, the cold beach,
    Surrounding him was the severe cold below freezing.
    In order to prevent the valuable instruments from being damaged by the cold,
    He took off his cotton coat and wrapped the instruments.
    "That night, the instruments were of course not damaged,
    But we were busy for several days due to his severe cold.
    The young people here are all like this,
    It seems that the instruments are more valuable than their bodies."
    Tomorrow morning, we will leave the basin,
    Tonight, we sleep in a tent together.
    It's already three o'clock, and he hasn't fallen asleep yet,
    He is always tossing and turning on the army bed.
    What is this young heart excited about?
    I couldn't help but continue to chat with him:
    "In a few days, we will return to Beijing,
    Write a letter, and I will definitely deliver it to her."
    "I am in agony over this matter –
    How can so many words be written completely?
    Please give her a few words when you return to Beijing,
    And also tell her about our life.
    "There will definitely be such a day in the future,
    She will revel in two pieces of good news on the same day:
    I will take the express train from the basin back to Beijing;
    We have found a new oil field for the motherland in Qaidam!"

    柴达木一青年
    ——“初进柴达木”组诗之三
    李季
    在我们光辉灿烂的生活里，
    有着多少个黄金铸成的青年。
    他们像鱼一样的在大海里游泳，
    像鹰一样的飞上雪线以上的高山。
    就像刚刚离开弹筒的火箭炮弹，
    他们单纯而又勇敢地飞驰向前。
    他们的热情能使钢铁化成汁液，
    他们的意志会把严寒变为春天。
    在北海的游艇上你曾经见过他，
    他的歌声也曾飘荡在大雁塔前。
    在那狂欢之夜的天安门广场上，
    多少个姑娘曾把他的舞姿赞叹。
    我认识他是在青海的柴达木盆地，
    这时他已是个石油地质探勘队员。
    他的面孔已经晒得黑了，手也变得粗糙，
    他已经在盆地里工作了整整半年。
    在盆地里工作的人们都知道他，
    和在大学时一样，他还是青年团的支部委员。
    他用地质工作者特有的热情来欢迎我们，
    就像那些白发的探索大自然奥秘的人们一般。
    虽然他为了欢迎从关内来的亲人，
    特地在破旧的工作服上加了一件罩衫；
    可是，他的这一件深蓝色的“礼服”，
    却也是这个补绽和那个补绽紧相接连。
    像一个全副武装的国防军的战士，
    他整天地携带着气压表和小罗盘。
    暗绿色的背囊和他的那把小榔头，
    就是在睡觉时也没有离开过他身边。
    在去昆仑山下探测水源的路上，
    我们在吉普车上把心事交谈：
    辽阔得像海洋似的盆地里见不到一个人，
    因为缺水，多少天连个鸟兽也难以看见。
    每一天都要经过春夏秋冬四个季节，
    午夜里穿上皮衣，到中午又脱得只剩一件衬衫。
    刚刚离开北京，一下子就来到盆地里，
    他对这终日爬山的野外生活，的确有些过不惯。
    是那巍峨的昆仑山消除了他的疲劳，
    是那黄金般的油沙把他的热情点燃。
    祖国的柴达木简直是一座聚宝盆啊，
    在这里工作自有光荣和幸福与你作伴。
    每当他坐在点燃着蜡烛的小桌前填写报表，
    那些浸透着石油香味的数目字都会使他狂欢；
    他好像看见了戈壁上一行行的脚印，
    都已经安装起了又粗又大的输油管。
    艰苦的劳动最能把人的意志锻炼，
    支持着他的是为祖国寻找新油田的信念。
    他开始习惯了用沙子洗碗、洗脚的生活，
    也学会了几天不喝水，一根烟吸它三天。
    所有的话，他都说得那样真实，
    只有一件事他却把我欺骗。
    他说在盆地里他从来没有害过病，
    医生同志说这是他的谎言。
    在详查油沙山地质构造的那一天，
    他一股劲地坚持工作到太阳落山。
    在海浪似的沙滩上他迷失了道路，
    像匹野马似的，他在戈壁上睡了一夜晚。
    漆黑的夜幕，冰冷的沙滩，
    包围着他的是冰点以下的严寒。
    为了怕寒冷冻坏了宝贵的仪器，
    他从身上脱下棉衣把仪器包掩。
    “这一夜，仪器当然没有受到损坏，
    我们却为他的重感冒忙碌了好几天。
    这里的年轻人们都是这个样子，
    好像仪器比他们的身体更要值钱。”
    明天一早，我们就要离开盆地，
    夜晚我们睡在一个帐棚里边。
    已经三点钟了，他还没有入睡，
    他总是在行军床上左右翻转。
    这颗年轻的心在为什么激动？
    我不由地又和他继续攀谈：
    “几天之后，我们就要回到北京，
    写封信吧，我一定送到她的手边。”
    “我就是在为这件事情熬煎，——
    这么多的话，怎么能够写得完？
    请你回到北京时给她捎几句话，
    顺便也把我们的生活给她谈谈。
   “将来一定会有那么一天，
    她在同一天里为两个喜讯狂欢：
    我坐着从盆地里开出的快车回到北京；
    我们给祖国在柴达木找到了新的油田！”
