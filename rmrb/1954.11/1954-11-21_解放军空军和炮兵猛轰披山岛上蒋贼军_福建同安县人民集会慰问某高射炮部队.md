Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 20th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and artillery on the Zhejiang front fiercely bombed and shelled the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on Pishan Island.

At noon on the 20th, our People's Air Force mixed squadron fiercely bombed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on Pishan Island. A large number of bombs dropped by our Air Force squadrons all hit the designated bombing targets. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' command post, artillery positions, group fortifications, and ammunition depots in the Shangkanmen area of the island were immediately blasted into a raging inferno.

The sudden and fierce bombing by our Air Force mixed squadron meant that many of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' anti-aircraft weapons did not have time to fire.

After all of our Air Force squadrons safely returned and landed, Chiang Kai-shek's air force took the opportunity to fly over Dachen Island, attempting to retaliate against us. However, when another of our Air Force groups took off to meet them, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' planes hurriedly turned around and fled south.

That evening, our People's Liberation Army artillery units again launched a fierce bombardment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on Pishan Island, which had been severely destroyed.

Pishan Island is located outside Wenzhou Bay in Zhejiang, about one hundred li northeast of Dachen Island. The island has a strategic location. It is a major stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops to blockade the mouth of the Oujiang River and rob ships and merchant ships along the southeastern coast of Zhejiang. The island is garrisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' "Pishan Defense Command" and artillery, pirate, and guerrilla units, totaling about 1,500 people, who frequently harass our coastal mainland. The American intelligence agency "Western Enterprises, Inc." also frequently dispatches Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents from this island to the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang Province to carry out various sabotage and assassination activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: More than 6,000 people from all walks of life in Tong'an County, Fujian Province, held a grand meeting to warmly console a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that shot down and damaged eight Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes and killed Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Battalion Commander Chen Kang in the Tong'an area on November 1st.

When the heroes of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the venue, the entire audience enthusiastically cheered: "Salute to the heroic People's Liberation Army!" "Resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!" The responsible persons of the Party and government organs of Tong'an County delivered a message of consolation to this anti-aircraft artillery unit on behalf of the people of the county at the meeting, and presented the anti-aircraft artillery unit with four banners and many gifts of appreciation.

The representative of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army reported at the meeting the process by which they severely struck the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, and expressed that they would humbly learn, continue to improve tactics and techniques, and strive for greater victories to thank people from all walks of life for their care and consolation.

    解放军空军和炮兵猛轰披山岛上蒋贼军
    福建同安县人民集会慰问某高射炮部队
    【新华社浙江前线二十日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军空军、炮兵猛烈轰炸和炮击披山岛上蒋贼军阵地。
    二十日中午，我人民空军混合机队猛烈轰炸了披山岛上的蒋贼军阵地，我空军机队投下的大量炸弹全部命中了预定轰炸目标，岛上上坎门一带蒋贼军的指挥所、炮兵阵地、集团工事和弹药库等当即被炸得烟火冲天。
    我空军混合机队突然猛烈的轰炸，使岛上蒋贼军的许多高射火器都没来得及发射出火力。
    当我空军机队全部安全返航着陆后，蒋贼空军飞机乘隙飞到大陈岛上空，企图向我进行报复。但当我另一空军机群起飞迎击时，蒋贼军飞机又慌忙调头向南逃去。
    当天黄昏，我人民解放军炮兵部队又向披山岛上受到严重摧毁的蒋贼军阵地进行了猛烈的轰击。
    披山岛在浙江温州湾外，东北距大陈岛约一百华里，岛上地势险峻，是蒋贼军封锁我瓯江口和抢劫浙江东南沿海海船、商船的主要据点。岛上驻有蒋贼军“披山防御司令部”及炮兵、海匪游杂部队共约一千五百多人，经常向我沿海大陆进行骚扰。美国特务机关“西方企业公司”也经常从这个岛上向我浙江省温州地区派遣蒋贼特务，进行各种破坏和暗害活动。
    【新华社福建前线十八日电】福建省同安县各界人民六千多人举行盛会，热烈慰问十一月一日在同安地区击落、击伤蒋贼飞机八架并击毙蒋贼空军上校副大队长陈康的中国人民解放军某高射炮部队。
    当人民解放军某高射炮部队的功臣们进入会场时，全场热烈欢呼：“向英雄的人民解放军致敬！”“坚决支援人民解放军解放台湾！”同安县党、政机关负责人在会上代表全县人民向这支高射炮部队致慰问词，并赠送给这支高射炮部队四面锦旗和许多慰问品。
    人民解放军某高射炮部队的代表在会上报告了他们痛击蒋贼飞机的经过，并表示要虚心学习，继续提高战术、技术，争取更大的胜利来答谢各界人民的关怀和慰问。
