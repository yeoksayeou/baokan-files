The construction tasks for the newly built Jiamusi Sugar Factory have been completed ahead of schedule this year. This project commenced on April 17th this year. Over the past seven months, workers have built a 26-meter-high chimney, boiler room, condenser room, machine repair shop, material warehouse, turbine room, main factory building, as well as residences and canteens, covering a total area of 18,620 square meters. Among them, the construction of the main factory building was completed 40 days ahead of the original schedule. The quality of all projects has basically met the standards stipulated by the state.

From the start of construction to the present, the employees of this construction site have proposed a total of 204 rationalization proposals. In particular, the promotion of various effective advanced experiences has continuously accelerated the construction progress. For example, the concrete workers promoted a cyclical flow operation method, completing their tasks on schedule or ahead of schedule every month. When the door and window project started, the weather was already getting cold. In order to complete the door and window project as soon as possible to facilitate the transition to indoor construction, the carpenters launched a labor competition, improved the labor organization according to their respective strengths, and carried out production and installation simultaneously, completing the entire door and window project two days ahead of schedule.

The workers at this construction site are currently carrying out additional projects to create favorable conditions for the early completion of mechanical equipment installation and handover to production next year.

    佳木斯糖厂今年的建设工程提前完成
    新建佳木斯糖厂今年的施工任务已经提前完成。这个工程在今年四月十七日开工，工人们七个月来共建成了有二十六公尺高的烟囱和锅炉房、凝结器室、机修厂、材料库、涡轮机室、主厂房以及住宅、食堂等，面积共一万八千六百二十平方公尺。其中主厂房今年修建计划提前了四十天完成。各项工程的质量基本上达到了国家规定的标准。
    这个工地的职工们从开工到现在，共提出了二百零四件合理化建议，特别是推广各种行之有效的先进经验，使施工进度不断加速。如混凝土工人推广了循环流水操作法，每月都按期或提前完成任务。在门窗工程开始施工时，天气已经渐渐寒冷，为了提早完成门窗工程以便转入室内施工，木工们展开了劳动竞赛，根据各人的特长改进劳动组织，并且一面制作一面安装，使全部门窗工程提前了两天完成。
    这个工地的工人目前正在进行追加工程，为明年提前完成机械设备安装移交生产创造有利条件。
