Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, November 26th: Zhejiang coastal fishermen are actively assisting the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces in capturing American-Chiang Kai-shek spies attempting to infiltrate the mainland and Chiang Kai-shek bandits harassing the coast.

　　In July of this year, Chiang Kai-shek's "Special Affairs Brigade" spy Ji Depin, under the command of the American spy agency "Western Enterprises Company, Dachen Branch," sailed from Nanji Island, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army, to Datongpan Island in Rui'an County, attempting to take the opportunity to infiltrate the mainland and carry out conspiracy activities. Local fishermen Hong Sanmu, Xu Ritian, and others found his behavior suspicious, so they devised a plan to lure him to drink. After the Chiang Kai-shek spy Ji Depin became drunk, the fishermen captured him and handed him over to the local public security organs.

　　In November of last year, Chiang Kai-shek spies Chen Leyi and Chen Chengmu, under the command of the "Western Enterprises Company, Dachen Branch," infiltrated Yueqing, Wenzhou, and other places to gather intelligence. They boarded a privately owned ship sailing from Wenzhou to Dongtoushan Island and forced the boatman to sail them to Beiji Island, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army. When the ship reached Datongpan Island, the boatman took advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek spy Chen Leyi going ashore to eat, secretly asked a female passenger on the ship to pretend to go ashore to relieve herself, deceived the Chiang Kai-shek bandit spy Chen Chengmu on the ship, and reported to the fishermen on the shore. The fishermen on the island captured the spy Chen Leyi who had landed to eat, and then used the pistol seized from Chen Leyi to arrest Chen Chengmu on the ship. Chen Chengmu opened fire to resist arrest and wounded a fisherman, but the remaining fishermen still used stones, wooden sticks, and other things to attack, and finally arrested the spy Chen Chengmu.

　　Coastal fishermen also actively reported to the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces and local people's governments or led the way to capture American-Chiang Kai-shek spies who had infiltrated the mainland. In September of this year, after the Chiang Kai-shek spy Pan Lingeng infiltrated Wenling County from Pishan Island, the fishermen immediately reported to the township people's government and assisted the coastal defense forces in arresting him. At the end of April of this year, the Sanmen County coastal defense forces and local people also arrested nine Chiang Kai-shek armed spies who had infiltrated the mainland based on reports and assistance from the fishermen.

　　Fishermen have also repeatedly annihilated small groups of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies and Chiang Kai-shek bandits encountered at sea. At the end of 1952, the "Jinshunxing" transport ship in the Haimen area was robbed by Chiang Kai-shek's army while sailing at sea, and the eleven crew members on board were also detained by Chiang Kai-shek's army for more than a month. Later, when Chiang Kai-shek's army used the "Jinshunxing" ship to go to sea to rob other merchant ships, the crew members on the "Jinshunxing" bravely and intelligently eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers on board, sailed back to the mainland, and seized a light machine gun and two pistols. In June of last year, five fishermen from Yanjiang Village in Sanmen County were forced by four Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in a small boat to sail to Jiang'er'ao Island, which was not yet liberated at the time, while fishing at sea at night. When the boat reached the middle of the journey, the fishermen bravely smashed to death a Chiang Kai-shek soldier who boarded the fishing boat, threw another Chiang Kai-shek soldier into the sea, and killed a Chiang Kai-shek soldier on the small boat with the seized weapons. Another Chiang Kai-shek soldier was forced to jump into the sea and drown.

    浙江沿海渔民协助解放军捕捉美蒋特务
     【新华社浙江前线二十六日电】浙江沿海渔民积极协助人民解放军海防部队捕捉企图潜入大陆的美蒋特务和在沿海骚扰的蒋贼海匪。
    今年七月间，受美国特务机关“西方企业公司大陈分公司”指挥的蒋贼“特情大队”特务季德品，从蒋贼军盘踞的南麂岛乘船潜入我瑞安县大铜盘山岛，企图乘机潜入大陆进行阴谋活动。当地渔民洪三姆、徐日田等发觉他形迹可疑，就设计诱他去饮酒，待蒋贼特务季德品酒醉以后，渔民们就把他捉住送交当地公安机关。
    去年十一月间，受“西方企业公司大陈分公司”指挥的蒋贼特务陈乐义、陈成木潜入乐清、温州等地刺探情报后，乘一艘由温州到洞头山岛的私营航船驶到瓯江口，又强迫船老大开船送他们到蒋贼军盘踞的北箕岛。当航船驶到大铜盘山岛时，船老大乘蒋贼特务陈乐义上岸吃饭的机会，暗中让船上的一个女乘客假借上岸小便，瞒过了在船上的蒋匪特务陈成木后就到岸上报告了渔民，岛上渔民捉住了登岸吃饭的特务陈乐义后，又用缴获到陈乐义的手枪到船上逮捕陈成木，陈成木开枪拒捕，并击伤了一个渔民，但其余的渔民仍用石头、木棍等来围攻，终于把特务陈成木逮捕了。
    沿海渔民们还积极地向人民解放军海防部队和当地人民政府报信或领路捕捉潜入大陆的美蒋特务。今年九月间，蒋贼特务潘林更从披山岛潜入温岭县境后，渔民们马上向乡人民政府报告，并协助海防部队把他逮捕了。今年四月底，三门县海防部队和当地人民，也在渔民的报告和协助下逮捕了潜入大陆的九名蒋贼武装特务。
    渔民们还多次消灭了在海上遭遇的小股美蒋特务和蒋贼海匪。一九五二年年底，海门地区运输船“金顺兴号”在海上航行时被蒋贼军劫掠，船上的十一个船工也被蒋贼军扣押了一个多月。后来，当蒋贼军利用“金顺兴号”船出海抢劫其他商船时，
  “金顺兴号”上的船工们勇敢而机智地消灭了船上的蒋贼军，驶回大陆，并缴获轻机枪一挺、手枪两支。去年六月，三门县沿江村的五个渔民夜间在海上捕鱼时被乘坐一只小划子的四名蒋贼军强迫开向当时还没解放的蒋儿岙岛，当船行至中途时，渔民们就奋勇地砸死了登上渔船的一个蒋贼军，把另一个蒋贼军丢进大海里，并用缴获的武器打死了小划子上的一个蒋贼军，另一个蒋贼军也被逼得跳海淹死了。
