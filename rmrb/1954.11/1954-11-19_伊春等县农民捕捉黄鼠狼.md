    Farmers in Yichun and other Counties Capture Weasels
    Farmers in Yichun, Huachuan, Tangyuan and other counties in Heilongjiang Province are organized to go into the mountains to capture weasels. Weasel skin is "yuan pi" [marten skin], and the "yuan pi" produced in Heilongjiang Province has long fur and thick绒毛[downy hair], and is golden in color, which is very famous at home and abroad. In the past, the annual output was more than 400,000 pieces, most of which were exported. In recent years, due to mountain closure for forest cultivation, the number of weasels has greatly increased. This year, in order to expand the production of "yuan pi", the people's governments in mountainous areas have planned to organize farmers to go to the mountains. Local product companies have also fully prepared hunting equipment and medicines, and signed purchase contracts with farmers going to the mountains. The hunting team of more than 500 people in Yichun County captured more than 300 weasels within three days after going to the mountains on November 8, and sold them all to the local product company according to the contract. Now the hunting farmers in the mountainous areas are working hard to capture them. (Niè Xiàotián)

    伊春等县农民捕捉黄鼠狼
    黑龙江省伊春、桦川、汤原等县组织农民上山捕捉黄鼠狼。黄鼠狼皮就是元皮，黑龙江省所产的元皮，毛长绒厚，色泽金黄，国内外都很有名。过去年产四十多万张，大部分出口。近几年来因为封山育林，黄鼠狼数量大增。今年为了扩大元皮生产，山林地区的人民政府有计划地组织农民上山。各地土产公司也充分准备了打猎用具和药品，并和上山农民签订收购合同。伊春县五百多人的打猎队，十一月八日上山后，三天内就捕捉黄鼠狼三百余只，全部按照合同卖给土产公司。现在山林地区的打猎农民正在努力捕捉。　　（聂孝田）
