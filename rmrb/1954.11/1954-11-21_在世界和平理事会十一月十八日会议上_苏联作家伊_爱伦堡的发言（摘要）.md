Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 19th (TASS): At the evening session of the World Peace Council on November 18th, Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg spoke after Jiichiro Matsumoto (Japan).

Ehrenburg said: This is the first time we are working without the hateful sound of gunfire. This is the achievement of all peace defenders.

Naturally, those who pursue a policy of strength have not abandoned their goals. They are trying their best to divide the people and intimidate the people. They have done everything they can. However, there are many things they cannot do now. Can the Manila Treaty obscure the full significance of the Geneva Conference in people's minds? Can the London and Paris Agreements offset the shameful end of the "European Defense Community"? No matter how eloquent and loud those who pursue a policy of strength are, can they drown out the sober voice of the Indian leader? The policy of strength is gradually failing: the policy remains, but the strength is weakening.

The belief that countries with different social systems must coexist peacefully has begun to penetrate the hearts of the most backward citizens in the most politically backward countries. We must not only insist that peaceful coexistence is possible, but also that countries must cooperate to ensure the security of each country and improve the material and cultural standards of mankind.

Talking about the situation in Europe, Ehrenburg said: Those who pursue a policy of strength say that this goal can be achieved by strengthening military blocs, expanding armaments, and especially arming West Germany. However, the final division of Europe into two opposing blocs will not promote cooperation, or even peaceful coexistence, between Eastern and Western countries. In the past, the "Triple Alliance" was aimed at France, Britain, and Russia. Therefore, another group, the "Entente," emerged. Everyone knows the outcome this time. The "Berlin-Tokyo-Rome Axis" led to the Second World War. Western countries are continuing to pursue a policy that inevitably leads Europe to disaster by establishing military blocs. Those countries that establish military blocs against other countries not only refuse to engage in sincere economic and cultural cooperation, but they also preemptively replace friendly negotiations that could resolve existing differences with threats, ultimatum-like notes, and all "cold war" tactics.

Ehrenburg continued, increasing armaments will not ease international tensions. The two are mutually exclusive. However, we see that those who pursue a policy of strength, just after saying at one meeting that they are willing to ease international tensions, immediately hold another meeting saying that armaments must be strengthened, first and foremost by stepping up the arming of the country that not long ago ravaged most European countries with weapons. Arming West Germany and bringing it into a military bloc is not only not a way to promote peaceful coexistence, but it also creates a new situation, a new threat to Europe and the world.

We should support any sensible proposal for disarmament and gradual reduction of national armies, no matter who puts it forward. This is not a long-term goal, but a current task. But is arming West Germany a path towards universal disarmament? Of course not. Édouard Herriot was absolutely right when he told his compatriots that peace cannot be found on the road to war.

We have said it before, and we will say it now: arming West Germany will make German unification impossible. This is clear to everyone. Some French people are afraid to talk about this; they opposed the "European Defense Community" not long ago, but now, with the addition of British spices, they agree to re-cook this clearly uneatable dish. Some French people are like this, while American Senator Flanders openly said: "I don't think rearmament can restore German unity, unless it is through a third world war."

The revival of German militarism threatens the people of all European countries, including the German people. That is why many political figures, such as Bevan, Catholic Democrat Meloni, Ollenhauer, and Belgian parliamentarian Rolin, who cannot be said to sympathize with the German Democratic Republic, also oppose the London Agreement. As for France, the "New York Times" correspondent in Paris described its mood perfectly, saying: "No groom forced to marry at gunpoint has ever been as reluctant as France was this week in agreeing to Germany's entry into the Western military alliance."

Of course, I believe that France can find a way out of the impasse, and its desire for peace will point it in the right direction.

Ehrenburg continued: The Soviet Union has stated that it hopes for German unification, and it has proposed negotiations with the three Western countries and agreed to discuss the West's proposal to hold free elections in Germany. Why hasn't the Soviet Union's proposal been accepted until now? Why do some Radical Socialists in France and some Labour Party members in Britain prefer to arm the SS and rebuild the German Wehrmacht, replaying the tragicomedy that led to the Second World War, rather than consult with their allies who fought against German militarism? They say, "It is difficult to negotiate with the Russians," "The Berlin Conference was disappointing," "It is foolish to waste time on empty talk," "The Russians use conferences for propaganda," but are these serious reasons? Indeed, the Russians could also say: because it is difficult to negotiate with the Americans, we are unwilling to negotiate. However, the Soviet Union still proposes negotiations. And it is not only the Parisians who are disappointed with the Berlin Conference, but also the Muscovites. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union still insists that negotiation is the only sensible way.

The Soviet government proposes convening an all-European conference with the participation of American representatives to discuss the issue of jointly ensuring European security. Each country participating in the conference can propose its own plan, and after discussion, a concrete and acceptable method for all countries attending the conference can be reached.

We can't wait any longer. It is time to demand that all European countries, regardless of the principles guiding their internal affairs, cooperate. Representatives of all European countries can and should reach an agreement on the issue of establishing security.

Now, it is up to the people of all European countries to decide how the governments of various countries respond to the proposals for ensuring the security of various countries and whether they can open an era of true peace. Our organization is meeting at a crucial juncture that may determine the fate of Europe and all mankind. The people of all countries still have time to prevent a major catastrophe. The people of all countries still have time to stop the division of Europe and the new arms race. The people of all countries should not let the shadow of war reappear in the heart of Europe.

We see that the words and deeds of political figures in some countries are inconsistent. On the one hand, they say they want to negotiate and coexist peacefully, while on the other hand, they conclude treaties to restore the German Wehrmacht (France's demon). When it comes to convening peace conferences, they are slow and hesitant. But when it comes to establishing German divisions, they are in a hurry. Perhaps they have lost their self-control, but the people of all countries can still control them.

Please allow me to say a few personal words to end this speech. As a Soviet citizen and Soviet writer, as someone who has experienced two world wars and seen the ashes of Reims and Novgorod, as a European who loves Europe and is loyal to Europe and often repeats Herzen's wonderful words about "the monuments of Europe," in these decisive days, I want to say to all Europeans: we must protect the beautiful things we already have, we must defend the future, we must not let Europe bleed and weep again, we must build peace! Every day is precious. Friends, please think about the oaths we made in this beautiful city before. This declaration we issue from here may save the world from the scourge of atomic war. Our strength was much weaker then, but now the trickle has become a great river, and now world opinion is in agreement with us. But the old enthusiasm must be ignited in the heart, there must be the excitement that existed on the days when the Stockholm Appeal was issued. Do not let the wrong things happen! Defend the road to peace!

### 在世界和平理事会十一月十八日会议上  苏联作家伊·爱伦堡的发言（摘要）

    在世界和平理事会十一月十八日会议上
    苏联作家伊·爱伦堡的发言（摘要）
    【新华社讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩十九日电：在世界和平理事会十一月十八日晚间会议上，苏联作家伊·爱伦堡继松本治一郎（日本）之后发言。
    爱伦堡说：这是我们第一次不在可恶的枪炮声中进行工作。这是全体和平捍卫者的功绩。
    自然，奉行实力政策的人并没有放弃他们的目的。他们正在竭力分裂人民，恐吓人民。凡是他们能作到的，他们都作了。然而，现在已有很多事情他们办不到了。难道马尼拉条约能够在人们的意识中使日内瓦会议的全部意义黯淡起来吗？难道伦敦协定和巴黎协定能够抵消“欧洲防务集团”所遭到的可耻结局吗？那些奉行实力政策的人无论如何健谈，说出多么响亮的话，难道能够淹没印度领袖的清醒的声音吗？实力政策渐渐不灵了：政策依然存在，力量却在削弱。
    不同社会制度的国家必须和平共处，我们这一信念开始深入到政治上最落后的国家最落后的公民的心中了。我们不仅要坚持主张和平共处是可能的，而且主张各国必须进行合作，以保障每个国家的安全，提高人类的物质和文化水平。
    爱伦堡谈到欧洲的局势，他说：奉行实力政策的人说，通过加强军事集团，扩充军备，特别是武装西德等，可以达到目的。但是，把欧洲最后分裂为两个对立的集团是不会促进东方国家和西方国家的合作，甚至和平相处的。过去“三角同盟”的矛头是针对着法国、英国和俄国的。因此便产生了另一个集团“协约国”。大家都知道这一次的结局。“柏林—东京—罗马轴心”产生了第二次世界大战。西方国家正在用建立军事集团的办法，继续奉行始终不变地必然把欧洲引向灾难的政策。那些建立反对其他国家的军事集团的国家不仅拒绝在经济和文化方面进行真诚合作，而且他们事先就用威胁手段、类似最后通牒的照会以及一切“冷战”手段来代替能够解决现存分歧的友好的谈判。
    爱伦堡接着说，用加强武装的办法是不能缓和国际紧张局势的。这两者是互相排斥的。可是，我们看到，奉行实力政策的人刚在一个会上说他们愿意缓和国际紧张局势，马上又举行一个会议，说必须加强军备，首先是加紧武装那个不久前拿着武器蹂躏了大多数欧洲国家的国家。武装西德和把西德拉入军事集团，不仅不能算做是促进和平共处的办法，而且造成了新的局势，造成了对欧洲和全世界的新的威胁。
    我们应当支持任何关于裁减军备、逐步裁减各国军队的明智的建议，无论这种建议是谁提出来的。这不是一个长远的目标，而是当前的任务。但是，难道武装西德是走向普遍裁军的道路吗？当然不是，爱德华·赫里欧说得完全正确，他告诉他的同胞，和平是不能在战争的道路上找到的。
    我们曾经说过，现在我们还要说：武装西德将使德国统一成为不可能。这是谁都清楚的。某些法国人怕谈到这一点，他们不久前反对“欧洲防务集团”，而现在由于加了英国的香料，又同意重新烹调这一盘显然是不能吃的菜。某些法国人是如此，而美国的参议员弗兰德斯却公然说：“我不认为重新武装能恢复德国的统一，除非是打第三次世界大战。”
    复活德国军国主义威胁着欧洲各国人民，包括德国人民在内。这就是为什么像比万、天主教民主党人麦洛尼、奥伦豪尔和比利时议员罗林这样许多根本谈不上同情德意志民主共和国的政治活动家也反对伦敦协定。至于谈到法国，“纽约时报”驻巴黎记者把它的心情刻划得极妙，记者说：“任何一个在枪口下被迫结婚的新郎都没有像法国这一周在表示同意德国进入西方军事联盟时那样的不乐意。”
    当然，我相信：法国可以走出绝路，它的要求和平的愿望将给它指出正确的道路。
    爱伦堡接着说：苏联已经表示，它希望德国统一，它提议和西方三个国家进行谈判并同意讨论西方提出的在德国举行自由选举的建议。为什么直到现在还不接受苏联的建议呢？为什么法国的一些激进社会党人和英国的一些工党人士宁愿去武装党卫军，再建德国国防军，重演导致第二次世界大战的悲喜剧，而不愿意和曾跟德国军国主义作战的自己的同盟者商谈呢？他们说，“和俄国人谈判很困难”，“柏林会议使大家失望”，“把时间浪费在空谈上是愚蠢的”，“俄国人利用会议来进行宣传”，但这些算得上是认真的理由吗？的确，俄国人也可以说：因为和美国人谈判很困难而不愿意谈判。然而，苏联却建议谈判。而对柏林会议失望的不仅是巴黎人，也有莫斯科人。尽管如此，苏联仍主张：谈判是唯一明智的办法。
    苏联政府建议召开一次有美国代表参加的全欧会议来讨论共同保障欧洲安全的问题。每一个参加会议的国家都可以提出自己的计划，经过讨论后得出一种具体的和全体出席会议国家都可接受的办法。
    不能再等待了，是时候了，应该要求全体欧洲国家不问它们指导内政的原则如何而进行合作。全体欧洲国家的代表能够而且应该在确立安全的问题上取得协议。
    现在，各国政府如何答复关于保障各国安全的建议以及是否能打开真正和平的纪元，这都要依靠欧洲各国人民。我们这个组织是在可能决定欧洲的及全人类命运的关头召开会议的。各国人民还来得及防止一次大浩劫。各国人民还来得及制止欧洲的分裂和新的扩军。各国人民不应该让战争的魔影再一次出现在欧洲的心脏。
    我们看到某些国家的政治活动家的言行不一，他们一方面说要谈判与和平共处，而另一方面却缔结恢复德国国防军（法国的恶魔）的条约。当谈到召开和平会议的时候，他们是慢吞吞的。但是，当谈到建立德国师的时候，他们则是急忙忙的。也许，他们已经失去自制的能力了，但是，各国人民还是可以控制他们的。
    请允许我说几句个人的话，结束这次发言。作为一个苏联公民和苏联作家、作为一个经历了两次世界大战和见过里姆和诺夫哥罗德的灰烬的人、作为一个热爱欧洲和忠于欧洲并且经常重复赫尔岑关于“欧洲的古迹”绝妙的话的欧洲人，在这些有决定意义的日子，我要对所有欧洲人说：我们要保护住我们已经有的美好的东西，我们要捍卫将来，我们要不让欧洲再流血流泪，我们要建立和平！每一天都是可贵的。朋友们，请想想我们从前在这美丽的城市所作的誓言。我们从这里发出的这个宣言也许可以使世界免受原子战争的惨祸。那时候我们的力量薄弱得多，而现在细流已经变成大河了，现在全世界的舆论都赞同我们。但是应当在内心燃起旧日的热情，必须有像发表斯德哥尔摩宣言的日子里所有的激动心情。不要让不正确的东西实现！要捍卫和平的道路！
