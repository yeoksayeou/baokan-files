    Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov was a Russian genius scholar and a great materialist thinker. His learning was profound. He was an expert in physics, chemistry, astronomy, geography, geology, minerals, history, and language, and also a painter and poet. He was the first to discover the law of conservation of matter.
    One hundred and ninety-nine years ago, Moscow University was established under his initiative and planning. Under his influence, Moscow University became the first university in Russia to open its doors to the masses and became the center of advanced scientific and democratic thought in 18th-century Russia.
