Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to Western news agencies, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique held two emergency meetings in succession within 24 hours after the sinking of the "Taiping" warship to discuss how to cope with the situation. The military ringleaders of the Chiang bandits also issued emergency orders to the Chiang bandit naval forces, ordering them to be on guard against attacks by the Chinese People's Liberation Army naval forces. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also consulted with its American masters, requesting more military assistance. United Press said that the sinking of the "Taiping" warship was a "shocking action," and this warship was one of the backbones of the Chiang bandit navy. United Press also said that the attack power displayed by the People's Liberation Army naval forces "is making the military authorities in Taiwan increasingly panicked." Associated Press also said that the sinking of the "Taiping" warship was a "major victory" for the People's Liberation Army naval forces, which "took the Kuomintang by surprise." Washington was also very uneasy about this heavy blow suffered by the Chiang bandit navy. According to Reuters, people in Washington said that the sinking of the "Taiping" warship "proves that Communist China now possesses a great naval force." CBS commentator Costello said on the 14th that the increasingly powerful strength of the People's Liberation Army naval forces will certainly constitute a "serious potential threat" to the Chiang bandit navy.

    蒋介石卖国集团表现很惊慌
    【新华社十八日讯】据西方通讯社报道，蒋介石卖国集团在“太平号”军舰被击沉后的二十四小时内，接连举行了两次紧急会议，讨论如何应付这种局势。蒋贼军事头目还对蒋贼海军部队发出紧急命令，要他们提防中国人民解放军海军部队的攻击。同时，蒋介石卖国集团还和它的美国主子商量，要求给予更多的军事援助。合众社说，“太平号”军舰的被击沉是一个“惊人的行动”，这艘军舰是蒋贼海军的骨干之一。合众社还说，人民解放军海军部队显示的攻击力量，“使得台湾的军事当局感到越来越惊慌。”美联社也说，“太平号”军舰的被击沉是人民解放军海军部队的“重大的胜利”，它“使国民党人大吃一惊”。华盛顿方面对蒋贼海军遭到的这一沉重打击也感到非常不安。据路透社报道，华盛顿方面人士表示，“太平号”军舰的被击沉“证明共产党中国现在拥有很大的海军力量”。哥伦比亚广播公司评论员柯斯特洛十四日说，人民解放军海军部队日益强大的力量，肯定会构成对蒋贼海军的
  “严重的潜在威胁”。
