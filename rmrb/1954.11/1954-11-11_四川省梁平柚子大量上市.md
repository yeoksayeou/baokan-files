    A Large Quantity of Liangping Pomelos from Sichuan Province Enter the Market
    Liangping pomelos from Sichuan Province, famous in major cities, have entered the market in large quantities. This year's Liangping pomelos, thanks to the local farmers' efforts in fertilization, pruning, and other work, are generally plump and full of moisture. Each pomelo generally weighs between twenty and thirty taels, with some weighing three to four catties. At present, farmers are enthusiastically selling pomelos, and the Liangping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative can purchase more than 10,000 pomelos every day.
    In order to meet the needs of major cities in a timely manner, the Liangping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has begun to ship pomelos to other places. (Xie Wan Di)

    四川省梁平柚子大量上市
    驰名各大城市的四川省梁平柚子已经大量上市。今年梁平柚子，由于当地农民作好了施肥、整枝等工作，一般都果实饱满，水分充足。每个柚子一般重二十两到三十两，有的重三斤到四斤。目前，农民们正踊跃出售柚子，梁平县供销合作社每天可收购柚子一万多个。
    为了及时供应各大城市的需要，梁平县供销合作社已开始向外调运柚子。　　（谢万弟）
