Comrade Chairman! Dear Comrades and Friends!
	As our country's economy and culture are experiencing a new upsurge, as the strength of the international socialist camp has been further enhanced, and as the national liberation movements in various colonial and dependent countries are constantly growing, the Soviet people are celebrating the thirty-seventh anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
	In an unprecedentedly short historical period, Russia has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial and collective farm country, a country with the most advanced state system and social system in the world—the socialist system.
	Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are confidently advancing on the road of gradual transition from socialism to communism.
	The Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Development Plan stipulates that our socialist motherland should take a big step forward on the road to communism. The economic achievements of the past three and a half years prove that the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan are being successfully completed. In particular, many of the main tasks in the plan can not only be completed, but also be completed ahead of schedule. The Soviet Union's total industrial output in the first half of 1954 increased by 14 percent compared with the same period last year.
	Our country now has full possibility to accomplish the task of rapidly developing those economic sectors directly related to people's consumption on the basis of the achievements of heavy industry.
	In order to ensure the realization of the plan to further improve agriculture, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have allocated a large number of the latest types of machinery to collective farms, machine tractor stations, and Soviet farms, and have transferred cadres to strengthen collective farms. In the first half of 1954 alone, agriculture received 192,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 52,000 trucks, 18,000 grain combine harvesters, and many other machines. There is now no agricultural sector in the Soviet Union where manual labor is not being increasingly replaced by machines.
	More than 150,000 skilled workers, engineers, technicians, agronomists, and other experts have voluntarily gone to the barren and cultivated wasteland areas to actively participate in the reclamation work. This year, about 17 million hectares of barren and cultivated wasteland have been reclaimed throughout the Soviet Union, which is much more than the total wheat sown area of countries such as France, French Morocco, Australia, and Argentina combined.
	On the basis of the upsurge of socialist production, the material welfare of the Soviet people is constantly improving. In the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the real wages of Soviet workers and staff increased by 30 percent, and the total income of workers and staff and the total income of farmers increased by 34 percent at comparable prices. In the post-war years, the Party and the government have reduced the state retail prices of industrial products and food every year. The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates a reduction of 23.5 percent in various retail prices. This task has been overfulfilled in four years; prices have been reduced by more than 25 percent.
	The role of culture, science, and art in our lives is growing. Comprehensively meeting the cultural needs of members of Soviet society is one of the most important tasks of the Soviet state.
	From the first day of its establishment, the Soviet socialist state has consistently fought tirelessly to defend peace and prevent war. The Soviet Union has always established relations with all countries on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will continue to do so in the future.
	As a result of the Soviet Union's victory over German fascism and Japanese militarism, many countries in Europe and Asia have broken away from the capitalist system. A strong socialist democratic camp has formed. This camp now unites more than 900 million people.
	The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are upholding the cause of peace on the international stage and striving to ease the international tensions that the enemies of peace are plotting to create. The armistice in Korea and the armistice in Indochina are major victories for the forces of peace.
	The free people of the democratic camp are widely using the experience of Soviet socialist construction, relying on the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and confidently advancing along the road of socialism.
	The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China are the biggest events in world history after the October Revolution and the victory of the Soviet Great Patriotic War. For five years, the Chinese working people have carried out effective struggles for the development of the national economy and culture, for the industrialization of the country, and for the victory of socialism. A major event in the life of the People's Republic of China was the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, which adopted a people's constitution.
	The People's Republic of China has become a strong country and a great force in the common struggle of freedom-loving people of all countries for international security and world peace.
	Now, every fair-minded person understands clearly that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no important international issue can be resolved; it is equally clear that the United States' aggressive policy towards the People's Republic of China, especially the action of the U.S. armed forces continuing to occupy China's Taiwan Island, will inevitably be defeated.
	The victory of the Chinese people has pushed the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries to a new and higher stage. The old Asia, which used to be the focus of dark oppression and enslavement of the people of all countries by foreign forces, is now gone forever. The people of the East have begun a significant process of revival, which is one of the main characteristics of our time.
	The Soviet people are heartily glad for the various achievements of the People's China, because the consolidation of the People's Republic of China and the growth of its strength is the consolidation of our common strength, that is, the consolidation of the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.
	Since the Chinese people achieved their historic victory, for five years, the relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have been based on close cooperation and are fully in line with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950.
	One of the powerful sources of our strength and invincibility lies in the friendship between the great peoples of our two countries. The stronger our friendship, the more afraid the enemies of peace will be of it, and the faster and more smoothly the development of our two countries will be. This has been confirmed by five years of experience.
	The extremely important documents signed after the talks between the Soviet government delegation and the government of the People's Republic of China on Soviet-Chinese relations and the international situation are a new historical milestone in strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet people and their Chinese brothers. These documents demonstrate the greatest strength of the new socialist relations between the two countries. All peace-loving people around the world welcomed the results of the Soviet-Chinese talks in Beijing with joy, regarding them as a new and significant contribution to the cause of further consolidating peace and security.
	The Soviet Union and the People's China, in close fraternal alliance with all the people's democratic countries, will continue to advance along the road of economic and cultural progress, along the road of strengthening friendly relations and peaceful cooperation with all countries, and along the road of safeguarding world peace and security.
	Long live the thirty-seventh anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution!
	Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China—a powerful factor for world peace! May this friendship and cooperation develop day by day!

### 苏联大使尤金院士的讲话

    苏联大使尤金院士的讲话主席同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    当我国经济和文化正处于新的高涨的情况下，当国际社会主义阵营的力量有了进一步加强和各殖民地及附属国家的民族解放运动不断增长的时候，苏联人民来欢庆伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。
    在一个空前短的历史时期当中，俄国从一个落后的农业国家变成为一个强大的工业的和集体农庄的国家，这个国家具有世界上最先进的国家制度和社会制度——社会主义制度。
    现在，苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正满怀信心地在从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路上迈进着。
    苏联第五个五年发展计划规定要使我们社会主义祖国在走向共产主义的道路上向前迈进一大步。过去三年半的经济成就，证明第五个五年计划的任务正在顺利地完成着。特别是计划中的许多主要的任务不但可以完成，而且能够提前完成。苏联一九五四年上半年工业总产量比去年同时期增加了百分之十四。
    我们国家现在有充分可能在重工业成就的基础上，完成急速发展同人民消费直接有关的那些经济部门这一任务。
    为了保证实现进一步提高农业的计划，共产党和苏联政府拨给集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和苏维埃农场大量的最新型的机器，并调遣干部来加强集体农庄。仅在一九五四年上半年，农业就得到十九万二千台拖拉机（每台按十五匹马力计算），五万二千部载重汽车、一万八千台谷物联合收割机和许多其他机器。苏联现在没有一个农业部门不是被机器日益代替了人工劳动。
    有十五万多熟练工人、工程师、技术人员、农学家和其他专家自愿到生荒地和熟荒地地区，积极参加垦荒工作。今年，全苏联开垦的生荒地和熟荒地约有一千七百万公顷，这比法国、法属摩洛哥、澳大利亚和阿根廷这些国家的小麦播种总面积加在一起还多得多。
    在社会主义生产高涨的基础上，苏联人民的物质福利正在不断地提高。在第五个五年计划的头三年当中，苏联职工的实际工资提高了百分之三十，职工的总收入和农民的总收入按比较价格计算增加了百分之三十四。在战后几年中，党和政府每年都要减低工业品和食品的国营零售价格。第五个五年计划规定减低各种零售价格百分之二十三点五。这个任务在四年时间中即已超额完成；价格减低了百分之二十五以上。
    文化、科学和艺术在我国生活中的作用日益增长。全面地满足苏维埃社会的成员的文化需要，正是苏维埃国家的最重要的任务之一。
    苏维埃社会主义国家从它成立的第一天起，就一直一贯为保卫和平和防止战争而不懈地斗争。苏联一直根据平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则同所有的国家建立关系，今后还是如此。
    苏联战胜德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义的结果，使欧洲和亚洲的许多国家脱离了资本主义体系。强大的社会主义民主阵营形成了。这个阵营现在团结了九万万以上的人口。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家，正在国际舞台上坚持和平事业，力求缓和和平的敌人所阴谋制造的国际紧张局势。朝鲜停战和印度支那停战是和平力量的重大胜利。
    民主阵营的自由人民，正在广泛地利用苏联社会主义建设的经验，依靠苏联的无私的援助，满怀信心地沿着社会主义的道路迈进。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，是十月革命和苏联伟大卫国战争胜利以后世界历史上的最大的事件。五年来，中国劳动人民为了发展国民经济和文化，为了国家的工业化，为了社会主义的胜利，进行了有效的斗争。中华人民共和国生活中的一件大事，就是第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，这次会议通过了一部人民的宪法。
    中华人民共和国已经成了强盛的大国，成为爱好自由的各国人民争取国际安全和世界和平的共同斗争中的伟大力量。
    现在，每一个公平无私的人都清楚：如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，任何一个重要的国际问题都不能够获得解决；同样也清楚：美国对中华人民共和国所采取的侵略政策，尤其是美国武装力量继续霸占中国台湾岛的行动，必然会遭到失败。
    中国人民的胜利把殖民地和半殖民地国家的民族解放运动推向新的、更高的阶段。旧的亚洲原是各国人民遭受外国势力暗无天日的压迫和奴役的焦点，如今已经一去不复返了。东方各国人民开始了具有重要意义的复兴过程，这种过程是我们时代的最主要的特点之一。
    苏联人民为人民中国的各种成就感到衷心的高兴，因为中华人民共和国的巩固及它的力量的增长，就是我们共同的力量的巩固，也就是整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营的巩固。
    自从中国人民获得历史性胜利以后，五年来，苏联和中华人民共和国之间形成的关系，是以密切合作为基础的，是完全符合一九五零年二月十四日所签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约的。
    我们之所以有力量和不可战胜，其中强大源泉之一，就在于我们两国伟大人民之间的友谊。我们的友谊越是坚强，和平的敌人就越害怕它，而我们两个国家的发展也就会更加迅速，更加顺利。这一点已被五年来的经验所证实。
    苏联政府代表团同中华人民共和国政府进行关于苏中关系和国际形势的会谈后所签订的极重要的文件，是加强苏联人民和自己的中国弟兄的友好关系中的新的历史里程碑。这些文件显示了两国之间新的、社会主义关系的最伟大的力量。全世界爱好和平的人民都欢欣鼓舞地欢迎了在北京举行的苏中会谈的结果，把它看成是对进一步巩固和平与安全的事业的新的重大贡献。
    苏联和人民中国同所有人民民主国家在紧密的兄弟般的同盟中，将继续沿着经济与文化进步的道路，沿着加强与各国友好关系及和平合作的道路，沿着维护世界和平与安全的道路前进。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年万岁！
    世界和平的强大因素——苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！祝这种友谊和合作日益发展！
