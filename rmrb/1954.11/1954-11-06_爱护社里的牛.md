    Cherish the Cattle of the Cooperative
   The "Shaanxi Peasant" newspaper prominently published a report on October 21 entitled "The Cooperative's Cattle Are Also Our Own Cattle." This report, through the example of Zhang Fangyin, a member of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong County, not cherishing the cooperative's cattle, and the subsequent discussion among the members about this matter, criticized the erroneous attitude of some agricultural production cooperative members towards public property, and provided an effective method for agricultural production cooperatives to conduct political and ideological work.
    Many peasants joined agricultural production cooperatives with the consciousness and habits of small producers. In the early days of joining the cooperative, and even for a considerable period after joining, they could not correctly understand the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, and did not care enough about collective interests. One specific manifestation of this was not cherishing the cooperative's public property. The situation of Zhang Fangyin's treatment of the cooperative's cattle, as reported by the "Shaanxi Peasant" newspaper, is a prominent example. Zhang Fangyin and two other members of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative carelessly injured a cow's hoof while harrowing. The wound was large, and the cow was immediately unable to work. Afterward, this sick cow was raised in Zhang Fangyin's home. One day, relatives of Zhang Fangyin came riding two animals, and coincidentally, it rained heavily in the afternoon. Seeing the rain, Zhang Fangyin quickly tied his relatives' animals to the manger, and instead pulled the cooperative's sick cow out of the pen to be rained on (originally, Zhang Fangyin's house had two mangers, enough to tie the relatives' two animals together and tie the sick cow separately to the other manger). Zhang Fangyin did this because he felt that "the sick cow belongs to everyone in the cooperative, what's the harm in it suffering a little." As a result, the sick cow was exposed to the rain, and dirty water entered the wound, worsening its condition. The cooperative not only incurred medical expenses, but also delayed the wheat planting time because the cow was unable to work for more than forty days.
      Such cases of not cherishing public property like Zhang Fangyin's were not isolated in the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative. The report said that this cooperative, which had only been established for two months, had not only ruined one cow, but also damaged and lost farm tools worth more than 500,000 yuan. In order to educate everyone to establish a correct attitude towards public property and clarify the relationship between members and the cooperative, the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative Committee held a forum for all members and led everyone to discuss this matter. At the meeting, everyone discussed the principles, calculated the details, and understood the close relationship between the interests of the cooperative and individual interests. Many members not only criticized Zhang Fangyin's wrong behavior in their speeches, but also examined their own mentality of "official oil, thick wick." Zhang Fangyin also made a profound self-criticism to everyone, expressing his determination to correct his mistakes. At the forum, everyone also put forward some specific suggestions on how to cherish public property. The feeding groups, storage groups, and production teams also proposed to launch a competition to cherish draught animals and farm tools. It can be seen that after this discussion, the members' understanding of the relationship between the individual and the cooperative has greatly improved.
    In addition to publishing this report, the "Shaanxi Peasant" newspaper also published an article by Liu Zongxiang, director of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative. In this article entitled "Who is the 'Box Owner'?", Liu Zongxiang criticized the idea of "if something is broken, there is a box owner" among some members with vivid facts and popular language, pointing out that this idea is an invisible wall between the members and the cooperative, and this wall must be torn down in order to consolidate and improve the cooperative.
    Conducting collectivist education for agricultural production cooperative members, helping them correctly understand the relationship between individual interests and the interests of the entire cooperative, the interests of all peasants, and the interests of the state, and improving their socialist consciousness, is a regular and important political task of agricultural production cooperatives, and also a regular and important propaganda content of peasant newspapers. The "Shaanxi Peasant" newspaper's attention to using vivid examples from actual life to educate peasants is worthy of promotion.

### 爱护社里的牛

    爱护社里的牛
   “陕西农民”报在十月二十一日以显著地位刊登了一篇题为“社里的牛，也是自己的牛”的报道。这篇报道通过武功县瓦子腰村前进农业生产合作社社员张方印不爱护社内耕牛，以及社员们对这事展开讨论的事实，批判了某些农业生产合作社社员对待公共财产的错误态度，并提供了农业生产合作社进行政治思想工作的一种有效方式。
    不少农民是带着小生产者的意识和习惯而加入农业生产合作社的。他们在入社之初，甚至入社以后一个相当长的时期内，还不能正确地理解个人利益同集体利益的关系，对集体利益不够关心；这方面的具体表现之一，便是不爱护社内公共财产。“陕西农民”报所报道的张方印对待社内耕牛的情形，就是一个突出的例子。前进农业生产合作社社员张方印等三人，耙地时不小心，把牛蹄子扎破了，伤口很大，牛当时就不能做活。以后这头病牛就喂养在张方印家中。一天张方印家有亲戚骑着两头牲口来了，碰巧下午天下大雨。张方印见下雨，连忙把他亲戚的牲口拴在槽上，反把社里的那头病牛拉出圈外叫淋雨（本来张方印家有两个槽，可以把亲戚的两头牲口拴在一起，把这头病牛单独拴在另一个槽上）。张方印所以这样做，是因为他觉得“病牛是社里众人的，吃些亏怕啥”。结果，这头病牛遭受雨淋，伤口又钻进了脏水，病势加重。社里不仅因此支出一笔医药费用，而且因为这头牛四十多天不能做活，推迟了麦子下种时间。
      像张方印这样不爱护公共财产的情况，在前进农业生产合作社内还不是个别的。报道中说，这个合作社才成立两个月，除使坏了一头牛外，还损坏和丢失了价值五十多万元的大小农具。前进农业生产合作社社务委员会为了教育大家树立对待公共财产的正确态度，明确社员同社的关系，就召开了全体社员座谈会，领导大家就这件事情进行讨论。会上大家讲道理、算细账、明白了合作社的利益和个人利益的密切关系。许多社员在发言中不仅批评了张方印的错误行为，而且联系检查了自己的“官家油、壮捻子”思想。张方印也沉痛地向大家作了检讨，表示决心改过。座谈会上，大家还提出了一些有关爱护公共财产的具体意见。各饲养组、保管组和生产队，并提出要展开爱护耕畜农具的竞赛。可以看出，经过这次讨论，社员们对个人同社的关系的认识已经大大提高了一步。
    “陕西农民”报除刊登这篇报道外，还发表了前进农业生产合作社主任刘宗祥的一篇文章。刘宗祥在这篇题为“‘箱主’是谁？”的文章中，用生动的事实和通俗的语言批判了某些社员中的“打破钩锣有箱主”的思想，指出这种思想就是社员跟社当中的一堵看不见的墙，必须推倒这堵墙，才能使社得到巩固和提高。
    向农业生产合作社社员进行集体主义教育，帮助他们正确地认识个人利益同全社利益、全体农民利益、国家利益的关系，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，这是农业生产合作社的一项经常的重要的政治工作，也是农民报纸的一项经常的重要的宣传内容。“陕西农民”报注意运用实际生活中的生动事例来向农民进行教育，是值得提倡的。
