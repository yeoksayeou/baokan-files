Seven state-owned farms in the suburbs of Beijing have recently been merged into two state-owned farms. The original Wulidian, Nanyuan, Heyi and Xinhua farms have been merged into the Nanjiao (South Suburb) Farm; the original Zhanghua, Bayi, and Xiyuan farms have been merged into the Xijiao (West Suburb) Farm. The Nanjiao Farm will focus on animal husbandry and appropriately develop vegetable planting, while the Xijiao Farm will mainly operate vegetable and fruit production, while also engaging in animal husbandry. After the merger, the various shortcomings in decentralized management can be overcome, and the political leadership work of the farms can be strengthened.

    京郊七个国营农场并成两个
    北京郊区原有的七个国营农场最近已合并为两个国营农场。原五里店、南苑、和义和新华等四个农场合并为南郊农场；原彰化、八一、西苑等三个农场合并为西郊农场。南郊农场将以畜牧为主，适当发展蔬菜种植，西郊农场主要是经营蔬菜、水果，兼营畜牧业。合并以后，可以克服分散经营中的种种缺点，并使农场的政治领导工作加强起来。
