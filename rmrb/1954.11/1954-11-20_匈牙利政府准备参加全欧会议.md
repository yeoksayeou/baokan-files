Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 18th: The Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic announced on the 18th the Hungarian government's reply to the Soviet government, stating that the Hungarian government has accepted the invitation from the Soviet government and is preparing to participate in the conference to be held in Moscow or Paris on November 29th.

The reply stated: The Hungarian people warmly welcome the Soviet proposal on concluding a treaty on European collective security. Considering that the decisive condition for the development of the Hungarian People's Republic is maintaining peace and European security, the Hungarian government particularly values and actively supports all efforts and proposals conducive to the cause of peace.

The reply stated: The lessons of Hungarian history prove that the Germanic desire for domination once hindered the development of Hungarian national independence and national culture for a century, and in recent decades, they have twice plunged Hungary into devastating wars. Considering the danger of the revival of German militarism and the new forced annexation of Austria, which threaten the Hungarian people, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic is striving to establish guarantees to prevent the resurgence of German aggressive conspiracies.

The reply stated: More than five years ago, the Hungarian government concluded treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and other countries out of the desire to prevent new German aggression. If, in addition to these bilateral treaties, a collective security treaty of all European countries is concluded, it will be a new and effective guarantee against the revival of German militarism and the avoidance of military conflicts. The Hungarian government believes that the implementation of the London and Paris agreements will mean the revival of German militarism, increase the danger of new wars, create difficulties in resolving the disputed European issues, especially the German question, and hinder the development of European countries. Peace-loving countries must not stand idly by.

The reply stated: Therefore, the Hungarian government fully agrees with the Soviet proposal. The Hungarian government accepts the invitation from the Soviet government and is preparing to participate in the conference to be held in Moscow or Paris on November 29th. The Hungarian government hopes that the governments of all countries invited to participate in the conference will realize the danger of a German revanchist army armed with atomic weapons, and participate in the conference from the true interests of their own people, promote the success of the conference, and help prevent new wars and establish a European collective security system.

    匈牙利政府准备参加全欧会议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯十八日讯：匈牙利人民共和国外交部新闻处十八日公布了匈牙利政府致苏联政府的复照，匈牙利政府已经接受苏联政府邀请，准备参加十一月二十九日在莫斯科或巴黎召开的会议。
    复照说：匈牙利人民热烈欢迎苏联提出的关于缔结欧洲集体安全条约的建议。鉴于匈牙利人民共和国的发展的决定性条件是保持和平和欧洲安全，匈牙利政府特别重视并积极地支持一切有利于和平事业的努力和建议。
    复照说：匈牙利历史的教训证明，日尔曼人的统治欲望曾在一个世纪中阻碍了匈牙利民族独立和民族文化的发展，而在最近几十年来，他们曾两次把匈牙利推入毁灭性的战争。匈牙利人民共和国政府考虑到恢复威胁匈牙利人民的德国军国主义和新的强制合并奥地利的危险，正力求建立防止德国侵略阴谋再起的保障。
    复照说：五年多以前匈牙利政府同苏联和其他一些国家缔结友好合作互助条约就是出于防止新的德国侵略的愿望。如果在这些双边条约之外，再缔结一个全欧洲国家的集体安全条约，那将是防止德国军国主义复活和避免军事冲突的新的有效保障。匈牙利政府认为，实现伦敦和巴黎协定，将意味着复活德国军国主义，增加新战争的危险，造成解决争论中的欧洲问题首先是德国问题的困难，并妨碍欧洲国家的发展。爱好和平的国家决不能对此旁观。
    复照说：因此，匈牙利政府完全同意苏联的建议，匈牙利政府接受苏联政府的邀请，准备参加十一月二十九日在莫斯科或巴黎召开的会议。匈牙利政府希望，被邀请参加会议的各国政府能意识到以原子武器武装的德国复仇军队的危险性，并从本国人民的真正利益出发而参加会议，促进会议的成功，帮助防止新战争和建立欧洲集体安全体系。
