Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: The workers of the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine had completed the annual coal production plan by November 6th. The total output value exceeded the state plan by 3.62%, the overall labor efficiency increased by 2% compared with the plan, and the cost decreased by more than 6% compared with the plan. The tunneling of the mine's main roadways also completed 97.06% of the annual state plan. In the past ten months, the workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine have increased production and saved nearly 20 billion yuan of wealth for the country.

This year, Pingxiang Coal Mine has vigorously strengthened planning management and implemented the system of one-person responsibility, which has greatly improved the management level of the enterprise. The political and ideological work of the Communist Party branch has also made great progress. It has been relatively successful in deepening political work at the grassroots level and combining political work with economic work, which has played a very good role in ensuring the completion of the production plan. Since the beginning of this year, the mine has also continuously carried out labor competitions. According to statistics from May of this year to the present, the mine's employees have put forward a total of 1,300 rationalization proposals and promoted 34 advanced experiences in stoping and tunneling.

Xinhua News Agency: The drilling work in the Weihe Coalfield in Shaanxi Province is nearing completion this year. From January to October, a total of more than 16,800 meters were drilled, completing 91% of the annual plan. The quality of drilling exceeded the national standards. The average core recovery rate reached 81%, and the coal core recovery rate reached 87%.

Although most of the drilling workers in the Weihe Coalfield joined the work not long ago, their technical level has improved rapidly due to their hard work. Some have already served as machine operators and squad leaders. In the second half of this year, drilling operation plans and sound handover systems have been universally implemented in each drilling rig, and the drilling efficiency has been very good. In the past ten months, the average monthly footage of each drilling rig has reached 146 meters, which greatly exceeds the national standard.

    萍乡煤矿提前完成全年煤炭生产计划
    渭北煤田钻进计划已完成百分之九十一
    【新华社南昌讯】国营萍乡煤矿职工到十一月六日止，已经完成了全年的煤炭生产计划。总产值超过国家计划百分之三点六二，全员效率比计划提高百分之二，成本比计划降低百分之六以上。全矿主要巷道的掘进工作也已完成全年国家计划百分之九十七点零六。十个月来，萍乡煤矿职工已经为国家增产节约了将近两百亿元的财富。
    萍乡煤矿今年大力加强计划管理和推行一长负责制，大大提高了企业的管理水平。中共支部的政治思想工作也有了很大进步，在政治工作深入基层、政治工作和经济工作结合等方面都作得比较成功，对保证生产计划的完成起了很好的作用。今年以来，这个矿还持续地开展了劳动竞赛。据今年五月到目前为止的统计，这个矿的职工共提出了一千三百件合理化建议，并在回采、掘进方面推广了三十四种先进经验。
    据新华社讯：陕西省渭北煤田今年的钻探工作快要完成了。从一月到十月累计钻进一万六千八百多公尺，完成了全年计划的百分之九十一；钻探质量都超过了国家规定的指标，岩芯采取率平均达到百分之八十一，其中煤芯采取率达到百分之八十七。
    渭北煤田的钻探工人，虽然大部分都是参加工作不久，但由于他们努力钻研，技术水平都提高很快，有的已担任机长、班长等职务。今年下半年，各钻机又普遍推行了钻孔作业计划和健全了交接班等制度，钻探效率一直很好。十个月来，每台钻机平均每月进尺达到一百四十六公尺，大大超过了国家规定的标准。
