Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: The "World Knowledge" magazine published on the 20th carries Guo Moruo's answers to questions raised by a reporter from the magazine under the title "How to Promote the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Relations?"

Guo Moruo first pointed out that the main obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations are: the United States is enslaving the Japanese nation, the Japanese state has not yet achieved independence, and the United States is doing its utmost to hinder the restoration of normal Sino-Japanese relations. The American warmongers want to use Japan against China to achieve their goals of aggression in Asia and world hegemony. At the same time, some Japanese people, under the direction of American warmongers, stubbornly adopt a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. The Japanese government disregards the government chosen by the Chinese people—the government of the People's Republic of China—and it is impossible to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Guo Moruo said: To promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, we must eliminate the obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. We know that the Japanese people oppose the American warmongers' aggressive policy of attempting to dominate the world. The United States has brutally violated the Potsdam Proclamation and trampled on the interests of the Japanese people. The Japanese people are making every effort to strive for independence and freedom. We believe that the Japanese people will find sufficient strength in themselves to embark on the road of shaking off their dependence on foreign countries and revitalizing their motherland.

Of course, the Japanese government should also break off relations with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, but it has not yet taken this step, and some Japanese generals are still blatantly supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor to China. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Japanese people should urge the Japanese government to break off relations with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Guo Moruo emphasized: If Sino-Japanese relations are normalized, the two countries can coexist peacefully, not invade each other, respect each other's territorial sovereignty, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs, then it will be difficult for the United States to launch a war in East Asia. As long as the people of China and Japan unite, peace in the Far East can be ensured. Ensuring peace in the Far East is a major contribution to the cause of world peace.

Guo Moruo also answered questions about developing cultural and trade relations between China and Japan. He said: There are various steps to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and we believe that developing cultural and trade relations between the two countries is also an important step. In the past two years, the people of the two countries have done a lot of work and made some achievements in developing cultural and trade relations. It can be seen that it is not impossible to develop this kind of relationship. However, this relationship is now subject to artificial restrictions. We hope that this relationship can be further developed. In the cultural field, cultural workers from both sides should increase mutual exchanges and widely exchange the results of cultural work. In terms of trade, both sides should widely exchange materials needed by each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Guo Moruo then pointed out: The main obstacle to developing this relationship is the American warmongers' policy of blockade and embargo. Because American warmongers are implementing this policy without reason, ships between China and Japan cannot travel smoothly, hindering contact between the people of China and Japan and greatly limiting the mutual exchanges between the two countries in culture and trade. If this unreasonable policy of blockade and embargo is not lifted, it will be difficult to develop cultural and trade relations between the two countries. We are willing to work together with the Japanese people to strive to remove this obstacle created by American warmongers, and we hope that the Japanese people, for their own happiness, will promote the Japanese government to adopt an independent stance and not obediently submit to the control of American warmongers.

Guo Moruo said: Although the relationship between China and Japan has not yet been normalized, thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the two countries, the friendly relations between the people of the two countries have shown good signs. The number of Japanese delegations coming to our country is increasing day by day, especially this year. During our National Day, we invited delegations of parliamentarians from various parties in the Japanese Diet and delegations from cultural and academic circles to visit our country. It can be said that the Chinese people have fully expressed their sincerity in wanting to enhance friendly relations with the Japanese people.

In the past few years, we have done our best to send back Japanese nationals who are willing to return to their country. We will also adopt a humanitarian stance towards Japanese war criminals, treat them leniently, and send them back. These facts have also increased the Japanese people's understanding of us. This time, the Japanese people invited our Red Cross delegation to visit, which is a good start. Our Red Cross delegation was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Japan.

Guo Moruo finally said: Facts have proved that after the Korean Armistice and especially after the Geneva Conference, the world's peace forces have been greatly strengthened, and the American warmongers have become more isolated. Under this situation, it is not in the interest of the Japanese government to continue to follow American policy. The fact that our Red Cross delegation visited Japan itself proves that the strength of the Japanese people is strong and can influence the attitude of the Japanese government.

We hope that more delegations from Japan will come in the future, and we also hope that our people will have more opportunities to visit Japan in the future. This can enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries, and the enhancement of understanding and friendship is of great significance for promoting the normalization of relations between the two countries. It is also of great significance for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

    关于促进中日关系正常化的一些问题
    郭沫若答“世界知识”杂志记者问
    【新华社二十日讯】二十日出版的“世界知识”杂志以“怎样促进中日关系正常化？”为题，刊载了郭沫若答这个杂志记者提出的一些问题。
    郭沫若首先指出，中日关系正常化的主要阻碍是：美国在奴役日本民族，日本国家还没有得到独立，美国竭力阻碍中日关系的恢复正常。美国好战分子想利用日本反对中国，达到它侵略亚洲和独霸世界的目的。同时，日本某些人士在美国好战分子指使之下，也顽梗地采取与中国人民为敌的态度。日本政府无视中国人民所选择的政府——中华人民共和国政府，这就不可能建立两国的外交关系。
    郭沫若说：要促成中日关系正常化，必须消除中日关系正常化的阻碍。我们知道，日本人民是反对美国好战分子企图独霸世界的侵略政策的。美国粗暴地破坏了波茨坦公告，践踏了日本人民的利益。日本人民正以全力来争取独立和自由。我们相信，日本人民会从自己身上找到足够的力量，踏上摆脱依附外国的地位和复兴自己祖国的道路。
    当然，日本政府还应当和蒋介石卖国集团断绝关系，但是现在还没有采取这一步骤，而且日本的一些将军们还在明目张胆地支持蒋介石卖国集团。任何人都知道蒋介石是中国的卖国贼。中国人民一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。日本人民应该促使日本政府和蒋介石卖国集团断绝关系。
    郭沫若强调说：如果中日关系正常化，两国和平共处，互不侵犯，互相尊重领土主权，互不干涉内政，那么，美国要在东亚发动战争就困难了。只要中日两国人民团结起来，远东的和平是可以确保的。远东和平的确保对全世界和平事业有重大贡献。
    郭沫若又答复了关于开展中日两国之间的文化和贸易关系的问题。他说：促进中日关系正常化有种种步骤，我们相信开展两国之间的文化和贸易关系也是一个重要步骤。最近两年来，两国人民在开展文化和贸易关系方面已经做了不少工作，有了一些成就。可见开展这种关系不是不可能的。但是，现在这种关系还受到人为的限制。我们希望这种关系能进一步展开。在文化方面，双方文化工作者应增加互相往来，广泛地交换文化工作的成果。在贸易方面，双方应该在平等互利的基础上，广泛地交换彼此所需要的物资。
    郭沫若接着指出：开展这种关系的主要障碍是美国好战分子的封锁禁运政策。由于美国好战分子毫无理由地执行这种政策，中日两国之间的船舶不能畅通，使中日两国人民之间的接触受到阻碍，使两国在文化和贸易方面的相互来往受到很大的限制。这种不合理的封锁禁运政策如果不撤除，对于发展两国间的文化和贸易关系是有困难的。我们愿意和日本人民共同努力争取撤除美国好战分子所造成的这种障碍，并希望日本人民为了自己的幸福，促进日本政府采取独立的立场，不俯首帖耳地甘受美国好战分子的控制。
    郭沫若说：尽管中日两国之间的关系尚未正常化，但由于两国人民的共同努力，两国人民之间的友好关系已有良好的表现。日本的代表团到我国来的日益增加，特别是今年，在我国国庆节的时候，我们邀请日本国会各党派议员的代表团以及文化学术界的代表团来我国访问。可以说，中国人民已充分表示了愿意和日本人民增进友好关系的诚意。
    几年来，我们先后尽力送回愿意回国的日本侨民。我们对日本战犯，也将采取人道主义的立场，宽大处理，并遣送他们回去。这些事实也增加了日本人民对我们的了解。这次日本人民邀请我国红十字会代表团去访问，是一个良好的开端。我国红十字会代表团在日本受到了各界人士的热烈欢迎。
    郭沫若最后说：事实证明，在朝鲜停战后，特别是在日内瓦会议以后，世界和平力量已大大增强，美国好战分子更加孤立了。在这种形势下，日本政府继续追随美国政策是对它自己不利的。从我国红十字会代表团访日这件事实本身，可以证明日本人民的力量是强大的，可以影响日本政府的态度。
    我们希望日本人民今后更多的派代表团来，我们也希望我国人民今后能够得到更多的访问日本的机会。这样可以增进两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，而了解和友谊的增进对于促进两国之间关系的正常化是有重大的意义的。对于维护远东和世界和平也有重大的意义。
