    Thanks to Soviet Experts for Helping Us Build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    Du Jingyun, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee

    The Hanshui Railway Bridge—an important component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge—is nearing completion. The connecting line from the Yudaimen Station of the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the left bank of the Hanshui Railway Bridge is also ready. Currently, the line engineering work in the Hanyang area is under intense construction, and soon, trains will be able to directly reach the bridgehead construction site of the Yangtze River Bridge.

    Although the main bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge has not yet started construction, in this short period, we have been deeply moved by the meticulous assistance provided by Soviet experts in the entire project of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, as well as in the survey, design, and preparatory construction work for the Yangtze River Bridge.

    The Hanshui Railway Bridge officially commenced construction on November 27, 1953. It is the first permanent double-track bridge built in our country since liberation, designed according to advanced Soviet methods and using mechanized construction. The Hanshui River only has a four-month dry season, with deep water and rapid currents. At that time, the Engineering Bureau had just been established, lacking experience and adequate preparation, while the underwater engineering required completion within one dry season, which was a complex and arduous task. Some engineering technicians expressed little confidence in completing the bridge piers above the water surface during one winter's dry season. Some said, "Building this bridge used to take three years, and now it will take at least two and a half years." Others said, "This project would have used pneumatic caissons in the past, with four piers in deep water, building one pier per year, taking four years to complete." However, under the correct leadership of the higher authorities and the guidance of Soviet experts, all employees worked selflessly, racing against the flood day and night, and overcame various difficulties. We finally completed all the bridge piers above the water surface on May 21 this year. Afterwards, we launched a flood control campaign while simultaneously riveting steel beams, and on September 27, we erected the steel beams. Now the Hanshui Railway Bridge has been fully completed, creating favorable conditions for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge next year. The reason we were able to successfully complete the task in one year, especially the completion of the Hanshui Railway Bridge in less than a year, is mainly due to the Soviet experts who came to the construction site to provide specific guidance, solving many complex problems. The assistance of Soviet experts has also improved our technical level and trained our team.

    Experts nurtured under the education of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union possess a high degree of internationalist spirit, loving the construction cause of the Chinese people as much as they love the construction cause of their own country. When positioning the wooden caisson, Comrade Oniskov worked while ill, and when the doctor asked him to check his temperature, he went to the construction site with the thermometer in his mouth. Experts not only have a selfless work spirit but also have very accurate foresight and planning in their work. Many problems remained unsolved after the construction of the Hanshui Railway Bridge began. For example, the No. 5 pier project required 18-meter steel sheet piles, but the steel sheet piles were ordered from abroad and could not be transported immediately. Therefore, Comrade Oniskov suggested in advance that we prepare a wooden caisson, which ensured that the No. 5 pier was rushed out of the water at a water depth of 24 meters.

    Soviet experts possess superb technology and rich experience, which is worthy of our learning. For example, when water jetting was used to sink piles for the Hanshui Railway Bridge, the progress was very slow because the operation was not skilled, and the effectiveness of the universal pile driver was not understood. They just hit the piles hard, even damaging the pile heads, and only drove 20 to 30 meters per shift. At this time, expert Shaburi came and pointed out that the reason for the slow speed was mainly the insufficient water jet pressure, and the flushing effect was ignored during operation. If the water jet force was greater, driving the piles would be like inserting them into soap. After we tested pile insertion according to the expert's suggestion, the 12-meter pile head sank automatically without being hit, and the overall efficiency increased fourfold. Once, a wooden caisson was being sunk. This wooden caisson was four stories high, 25 meters long, and 12 meters wide. Many engineers said that they had not only never done it themselves but had never even seen it before. However, under the personal guidance of expert Oniskov, the wooden caisson was positioned and sunk according to plan in two days.

    Soviet experts have very strict requirements for project quality. In order to save time, we had neglected quality in some issues. After Comrade Oniskov came to the construction site, he seriously pointed out the importance of ensuring project quality. He told us that for underwater engineering of bridges, there must be sufficient data and reasons to prove the solidity of each part. Capital construction is a project of a hundred years, and no carelessness can be tolerated. In order to find out the load-bearing weight of each pile, he suggested that all the piles that had been driven should be tested again with impact tests to ensure quality. The results of our implementation proved that the expert's opinion was completely correct. When Soviet experts saw that the joints of the wooden caisson were not tight and the caulking was not deep enough, they suggested stopping work for inspection and reinforcement. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, we reinforced the wooden caisson. After the wooden caisson was sunk and positioned, it remained very strong even under the pressure of deep water, and the seams did not leak.

    Soviet experts cherish national property, pay attention to saving funds, and value rationalization proposals, and are always concerned about the safety of workers. As soon as the Hanshui Railway Bridge started construction, we only emphasized racing against the flood to save every minute and second, and the bridge construction section gave whatever was asked for, and the cost accounting idea was not clear, resulting in wasted manpower, nothing to do during the day, overtime at night, and crowded and unreasonable use of machinery. After the Soviet experts discovered this, they pointed out to us that technical workers should always save the country technically. According to the geological conditions on the right bank, expert Shaburi changed to using a hammer to drive piles, saving 228 sections of pipe piles, plus savings in labor and machinery, for a total savings of 2.288 billion yuan. Comrade Oniskov found that the sand and gravel used in the laboratory contained very little mud and could be used directly without washing, saving 250 million yuan in labor costs for 4,470 cubic meters of stone ballast. For example, the Hankou connecting line transported soil by train from 40 li away, unloaded it on one side of the main line, and the workers had to climb a very high slope to carry the soil, resulting in very low work efficiency. At that time, intern Liu Peiliang and foreman Chang Zhiqing suggested laying rails on the main line, with the train running directly on the main line, unloading and spreading the soil on one side while lifting the rails to unload the soil. However, the leadership of the section did not accept this suggestion. After Comrade Oniskov came to the construction site and learned about this situation, he supported the suggestion of laying rails on the main line. After the leadership of the section adopted this suggestion, half of the labor force was saved every day. From the Ren Shou Road to the Zhanggong embankment section alone, 120 million yuan could be saved, and the progress was accelerated.

    Over the past year, under the kind guidance of Soviet experts, our team has been greatly trained and improved from actual work. At present, the main bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge has not yet started construction, and a large number of experts in various fields for building the bridge, led by Comrade Xilin, have arrived one after another. Now the experts are studying the drilling geological conditions of the bridge, doing the construction organization design of the bridge, and making all preparations for the start of the bridge construction. At the same time, in order to facilitate transportation between Hankou and Hanyang, in addition to vigorously completing the earthwork of the railway connecting line, the Hanshui Highway Bridge has also begun to be built under the personal leadership of experts. The workload of the highway bridge is twice that of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, and we strive to complete the main underwater projects in the dry season this winter and next spring to facilitate the start of the trial construction of the bridge piers next year. The tasks ahead are arduous and complex. We must learn from Soviet experts with a down-to-earth attitude, implement the experts' suggestions more carefully, and under the deep care of Soviet experts and the encouragement of the people of the whole country, we firmly believe that we will be able to build a solemn and magnificent bridge on the turbulent Yangtze River.

    感谢苏联专家帮助我们修建武汉长江大桥
    中共武汉长江大桥工程局委员会副书记  杜景云
    汉水铁桥——武汉长江大桥的重要组成部分之一，即将全部完工了。从京汉铁路的玉带门车站到汉水铁桥左岸的联络线也已准备就绪。现在汉阳地区的线路工程正在紧张施工，不久以后，火车就可以直达长江大桥的桥头工地了。
    虽然长江大桥的正桥还没有动工，但在这一段短短的时间里，从汉水铁桥的全部工程中，从长江大桥的勘查设计和准备施工的工作中，苏联专家给我们的无微不至的帮助已使我们深受感动。
    汉水铁桥在一九五三年十一月二十七日正式开工。它是我国解放以来第一座永久性的复线桥，是按照苏联先进方法设计，采取机械化施工的。汉水只有四个月的枯水季节，水深流急。当时工程局才建立，经验不足，准备不够，而水下工程又要求必须在一个枯水季节内完成，这是一件很复杂艰巨的任务。有一些工程技术人员对一个冬季的枯水期将桥墩修出水面表示信心不高。有人说：“修这个桥，过去得三年，现在至少也得二年半。”也有的说：“这工程在以往得用气压沉箱，深水中四个墩，一年修一个墩，要修四年。”但在上级的正确领导，苏联专家的指导下，全体职工忘我劳动，日日夜夜和洪水赛跑，克服了各种困难。我们终于在今年五月二十一日，将全部桥墩修出水面。以后我们一面展开防汛斗争，一面拼铆钢梁，在九月二十七日，将钢梁架好了。现在汉水铁桥已全部完工，为明年修建武汉长江大桥创造了有利条件。一年来所以能胜利完成任务，特别是不到一年内能修成汉水铁桥，主要是由于苏联专家先后亲来工地具体指导，解决了许多复杂问题。苏联专家的帮助，也提高了我们的技术水平，锻炼了我们的队伍。
    在苏联共产党教养下的专家，有高度的国际主义精神，他们热爱中国人民的建设事业和热爱他们祖国的建设事业一样。在木沉井定位时，奥尼斯科夫同志带病工作，医生叫他检查体温，他口里含着体温表去工地。专家不只有忘我的工作精神，并且在工作中有非常准确的预见性和计划性。汉水铁桥在施工开始后，尚有许多问题没有解决。如五号墩工程需要十八公尺钢板桩，但是钢板桩是国外订货，不能马上运来。因此奥尼斯科夫同志事先建议我们准备木沉井，才保证了在二十四公尺深水位的情况下，将五号桥墩抢出了水面。
    苏联专家具有精湛的技术和丰富的经验，值得我们学习。如汉水铁桥射水沉桩开始时，由于操作不熟练，不懂万能打桩机的效能，只是用力打桩，甚至将桩头打坏了，每班仅打二十公尺至三十公尺，进度很慢。这时专家沙布里同志来了，他指出速度慢的原因主要是射水压力不够，操作中忽视了冲水效能，如果射水力量大了，打桩就像把桩往肥皂里插。我们按照专家建议试验插桩后，桩头十二公尺不打自动下沉，整个效率提高四倍。有一次，下沉木沉井。这个木沉井有四层楼高，二十五公尺长，十二公尺宽，许多工程师都说自己不但没做过，根本也没见过。但在专家奥尼斯科夫同志亲自指导下，木沉井两天就按计划定位下沉好了。
    苏联专家对工程质量的要求非常严格，为了抢时间，我们在某些问题上曾忽视了质量。奥尼斯科夫同志来到工地后，就严肃地指出保证工程质量的重要性。他告诉我们，对于桥梁的水下工程，必须要有充分的资料和理由来证明每个部分的坚固性。基本建设是百年大计，不能容忍丝毫马虎。为了查清楚每个桩的承载重，他建议对打好的桩都要再用冲突试验，以保证质量。我们执行结果，证明专家的意见是完全正确的。苏联专家见到木沉井接头不密贴，嵌缝不深，即建议停工检查加固。根据苏联专家建议，我们将木沉井加固。木沉井下沉定位后虽受到深水的压力，仍然十分牢固，缝不漏水。
    苏联专家处处爱惜国家财产，重视节约资金，并重视合理化建议，随时关心工人的安全。汉水铁桥一开工，我们只强调争取一分一秒和洪水赛跑，桥工段要什么给什么，成本核算思想很不明确，造成人员窝工，白天无事干，晚上加班，机具拥挤，使用不合理。苏联专家发现后，向我们指出，技术工作者要随时从技术上为国家节省。专家沙布里同志根据右岸地质情况改用锤击打桩，节省了管桩二百二十八节，再加劳动力和机具方面的节省，共节约二十二亿八千万元。奥尼斯科夫同志化验所用的沙石含泥量很微少，不用再洗可以直接使用，在四千四百七十立公方石碴中，就节省人工费二亿五千万元。又如汉口联络线自四十里以外用火车运土，卸到正线一边，工人担着土要爬很高的坡，工作效率很低。当时实习生刘培良和领工员常之清建议正线铺轨，列车直接走正线，一面卸土摊平，一面起轨卸土。但段的领导方面没有接受这个建议。奥尼斯科夫同志来到工地了解这个情况后，支持正线铺轨的建议。段的领导方面采用了这个建议后，一天节省劳动力二分之一。仅仁寿路至张公堤一段，就可节省一亿二千万元，并加速了进度。
    过去一年来，在苏联专家亲切的指导下，从实际工作上，使我们的队伍得到了很大的锻炼和提高。目前长江大桥正桥还没有开工，以西林同志为首的大批的修建大桥的各种专家都陆续来到了。现在专家正研究大桥钻探地质情况，做大桥的施工组织设计，为大桥开工作一切准备。同时，为沟通汉口、汉阳的交通，除大力完成铁路联络线土方外，并在专家亲自领导下，开始修建汉水公路桥。公路桥比汉水铁桥的工作量要大一倍，争取今冬明春枯水季节要完成水下主要工程，以便利明年争取开始试造大桥桥墩。今后的任务是艰巨复杂的，我们一定以老老实实的态度向苏联专家学习，更认真地贯彻专家的建议，在苏联专家的深切关怀和全国人民的鼓舞下，我们坚信，一定能在波涛奔流的长江上，建设起一座庄严宏丽的大桥来。
