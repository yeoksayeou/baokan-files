The Ministry of Construction Engineering of the People's Republic of China and the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Construction Trade Union jointly instructed all construction units to further carry out the production increase and conservation campaign to ensure the completion or over-completion of the 1954 construction and installation tasks. The instructions stated: As of the end of October, the fourteen key construction units and forty-three key unit projects under the Ministry of Construction Engineering had completed 89.52 percent of the annual plan, and general projects had completed 80.37 percent of the annual plan. Judging from the completion of tasks for key projects, the completion of some multi-year projects is still good. For example, the key projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had completed 91.3 percent of the annual plan by the end of October, the three key projects of the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory had completed more than 99 percent of the annual plan, and the key projects of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory had all been completed. However, the construction tasks for some key projects that started in the second half of this year have been completed very poorly. For example, some key projects only completed 8.51 percent of the annual plan by the end of October, and some key projects only completed 51.39 percent of the annual plan. The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Preparatory Committee of the Construction Trade Union require the administration and trade unions of all units to use the production increase and conservation campaign as an important means to complete this year's various planned targets and promote enterprise management, and to ensure the completion of key projects. In the competition, it is necessary not only to ensure the progress of the project and complete the project tasks, but also to pay special attention to project quality, pay attention to safety, practice strict economy, and complete the task of reducing costs.

    建筑工程部等指示各建筑单位
    保证完成或超额完成今年的任务
    中华人民共和国建筑工程部和中国建筑工会筹备委员会联合指示各建筑单位，进一步开展增产节约竞赛，保证完成或超额完成一九五四年建筑安装任务。指示中说：建筑工程部所属十四个重点建设单位、四十三项重点单位工程，截至十月底止，已完成了年度计划的百分之八十九点五二，一般工程完成年度计划的百分之八十点三七。从重点工程完成任务的情况来看，一些跨年度工程完成任务都还不错，如第一汽车制造厂的重点工程，到十月底已完成年度计划的百分之九十一点三，哈尔滨电表仪器厂三项重点工程已完成年度计划的百分之九十九多，哈尔滨电机厂的重点工程已全部完工。但是，今年后半年开工的一些重点工程，建筑任务完成得很差，如某些重点工程到十月底只完成年度计划的百分之八点五一，有的重点工程只完成年度计划的百分之五十一点三九。建筑工程部和建筑工会筹委会要求各单位的行政和工会，把增产节约竞赛作为完成今年各项计划指标和推进企业管理的重要手段，保证完成重点工程。在竞赛中不但要保证工程进度，完成工程任务，而且要特别注意工程质量，注意安全，厉行节约，完成降低成本的任务。
