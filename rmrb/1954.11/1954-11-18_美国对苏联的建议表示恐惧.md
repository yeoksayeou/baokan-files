Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 17th: TASS, New York, November 16th: A U.S. State Department spokesman told reporters that the State Department had received the Soviet government's note of the 13th and was studying it.

    Associated Press reporter Hightower said that the State Department spokesman had carefully studied the Soviet note published in Moscow, and judging from all indications, the State Department spokesman still held Secretary of State Dulles's opinion: negotiations with the Soviets on major European issues would not be successful until the issue of West Germany's participation in the Atlantic Alliance was finally resolved.

    Hightower speculated on what steps the Soviet Union would take if the United States and other Western countries rejected the Soviet government's proposal. He believes that the Soviet Union would obviously convene a conference in Moscow of countries responding to the Soviet proposal and may conclude some kind of treaty at this conference that might be the Eastern counterpart to the Atlantic Alliance.

    The reaction of American "official sources" is the subject of commentary by other observers who believe that the United States will reject the Soviet proposal. In their conversations, these "official sources" arbitrarily assert that the Soviet note is a "propaganda ploy" whose sole purpose is to divide the "united front" of Western countries and hinder the ratification of the London and Paris agreements. The "New York Times" published a dispatch on the front page entitled "Washington Cool to Soviet Proposal," which pointed out that the United States' earlier rejection of the proposal to hold a four-power conference before the ratification of the Paris agreements "also applies to the currently proposed all-European conference."

    The remarks made by American "official sources" and newspapers leave no doubt that the United States is trying to set the tone for the reactions of other countries and their like-minded people to the recent Soviet proposal. However, dispatches from various European capitals published in many American newspapers reflect an obvious fear that the Soviet proposal to convene an all-European conference would be well received by the public and ruling circles of Western European countries. To this end, "New York Times" reporter Schmidt, in discussing the views of diplomatic officials, said that formally rejecting the Soviet proposal was the easiest thing to do, while dealing with the impact of the Soviet proposal in Europe would be much more difficult.

    美国对苏联的建议表示恐惧
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国国务院的一位发言人告诉记者们说，国务院已经接到苏联政府十三日的照会，并且正在研究这份照会。
    美联社记者海托华说，国务院发言人已经仔细研究过在莫斯科发表的苏联照会，从一切迹象判断，国务院发言人仍然持有国务卿杜勒斯的意见：在西德参加大西洋联盟的问题最后正式解决以前，和苏联人进行欧洲重大问题的谈判不可能获得成功。
    海托华推测如果美国和其他西方国家拒绝苏联政府的建议，苏联将会采取什么步骤。他认为苏联显然会在莫斯科召集一个响应苏联建议的各国的会议，并且可能会在这个会议上缔结某种可能是东方用以和大西洋联盟相抗衡的条约。
    美国“官方人士”的反应是另外一些认为美国将拒绝苏联建议的观察家的评论的主题，这些“官方人士”在谈话里武断苏联的照会是一种“宣传手段”，它的唯一目的是要分化西方国家的“阵线”，阻挠批准伦敦和巴黎协定。“纽约时报”在第一版登载了一条题为“华盛顿对苏联的建议表示冷淡”的电讯，这条电讯指出：美国早先对在批准巴黎协定以前举行四国会议的建议所表示的拒绝，“也适用于目前建议中的全欧会议”。
    美国“官方人士”和报纸发表的言论使人毫不怀疑，美国是在设法为其他国家内和他们志同道合的人们对最近苏联建议的反应定一个调子。但是，登载在许多美国报纸上的来自欧洲各国首都的电讯，反映了一种显而易见的恐惧，唯恐苏联关于召开全欧会议的建议会得到西欧各国公众和统治集团的良好反应。为此，“纽约时报”记者施密特在谈到外交官员的意见时说，正式拒绝苏联的建议是最容易不过的事，而要对付苏联建议在欧洲产生的影响那就困难得多了。
