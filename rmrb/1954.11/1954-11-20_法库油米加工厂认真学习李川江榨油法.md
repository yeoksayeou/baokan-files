Xinhua News Agency:

    The oil extraction workshop of the state-owned Faku County Oil and Rice Processing Plant in Liaoning Province has recently increased the oil yield from every hundred catties of second-grade soybeans to fifteen catties, six taels and three qian, which is about three catties higher than the current general soybean oil yield.

    The workers in this workshop earnestly studied Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction operation method. During the labor emulation drive, they carefully inspected the oil press and bean rolling machine, expanded the drying equipment, and improved the operating techniques. Therefore, since processing the new soybeans, they have changed the previous situation where new soybeans were not easy to yield more oil, and the oil yield has been rising day by day. It is estimated that by the end of the year, they can increase the production of soybean oil for the country by more than 18,000 catties.

    法库油米加工厂认真学习李川江榨油法
    辽宁省法库县地方国营油米加工厂制油车间每百斤二等大豆的出油量最近已提高到十五斤六两三钱，比目前一般的大豆出油量高出三斤左右。
    这个车间的职工认真地学习李川江大豆榨油操作法，在劳动竞赛中又仔细地检修油榨、轧豆机，扩大了干燥设备，改进了操作技术，因此从加工新大豆以来，改变了过去新大豆不容易多出油的情况，出油率逐日上升，估计到年底可给国家增产一万八千多斤豆油。（新华社）
