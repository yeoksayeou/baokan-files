Hunan Province's millions of mu of camellia forests, thanks to sufficient rainfall this year and farmers' attention to cultivation, have yielded abundant camellia seeds. The estimated total output will increase by 30% compared to last year, potentially producing over 500,000 dan of camellia oil.

Currently, camellia seeds are generally mature, and farmers across various regions are actively harvesting them. To increase the harvest yield, many areas have uniformly stipulated harvest dates based on local conditions and strengthened management to prevent premature and rushed harvesting. In Guanshan Township, Pingjiang County, camellia seed production increased by 20% last year compared to the previous year, and this year it is expected to increase again. Farmer Lin Kuixun's five mu of camellia forest yielded 16 dan of camellia seeds last year, and this year he harvested 60 dan. Wang Bojun, a farmer from Xinlong Township, 15th District, Changsha County, only harvested 41 jin of camellia seeds last year. This year, by implementing timely and meticulous harvesting, he collected 105 jin. This year, the camellia seed production of Santang Farm increased by 20% compared to last year.

To further expand the planting area of camellia forests, various regions have paid attention to selecting and retaining superior seeds during harvesting. Changde Prefecture will select and retain more than 200,000 jin of superior seeds for direct seeding and afforestation next year. Farmers in Enxi Township and Shang'enxi Township, Pingjiang, have also selected and retained sufficient superior seeds during harvesting.

    湖南省油茶成熟总产量将比去年增加三成
    湖南省数百万亩油茶林，由于今年雨水充足，农民注意培育，油茶籽结得很多，估计总产量将比去年增产三成，可产茶油五十万担以上。
    现在油茶籽已普遍成熟，各地农民正在积极进行采摘。为了提高收获量，许多地区根据情况分别统一规定采摘日期，并加强管理工作，防止抢摘和早摘。平江县关山乡的油茶籽，去年比前年增产了两成，今年比去年又要增产，农民林蒯勋的五亩油茶林，去年收了十六担茶籽，今年收了六十担。长沙县十五区新隆乡农民王伯俊去年只收了四十一斤油茶籽，今年实行了适时采摘和细收细摘，收了一百零五斤。三塘农场今年的油茶籽，比去年增产了百分之二十。
    为了进一步扩大油茶林的种植面积，各地在采摘中注意了选留良种。常德专区各地将选留良种二十多万斤，准备明年直播造林。平江恩溪乡、上恩溪乡农民在收摘中也选留了足够的良种。
