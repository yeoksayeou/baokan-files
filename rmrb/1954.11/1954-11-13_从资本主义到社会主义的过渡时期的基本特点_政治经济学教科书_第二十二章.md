    The Inevitability of Proletarian Revolution and the Transition Period from Capitalism to Socialism
    The development of the capitalist mode of production and the entire process of class struggle in bourgeois society inevitably lead to the socialist revolution replacing capitalism. As has been shown earlier, in the era of imperialism, the conflict between the growing productive forces and the bourgeois relations of production, which have become fetters on these productive forces, reaches an unprecedented degree of acuteness. The law that relations of production must correspond to the nature of the productive forces requires the elimination of the old bourgeois relations of production and the establishment of new socialist relations of production. From this arises the objective inevitability of proletarian revolution, that is, socialist revolution.
    Due to the opposition between the foundations of bourgeois society and the foundations of socialist society, due to the antagonism between the interests of labor and the interests of capital, the peaceful "growing into" socialism of capitalism, as advocated by the opportunists, is impossible. The transition from capitalism to socialism can only be achieved through proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Due to its economic position, the proletariat is the only class capable of uniting all laborers around itself to overthrow capitalism and achieve socialist victory.
    The proletarian revolution differs in principle from all previous revolutions. The transition from slavery to feudalism and from feudalism to capitalism involved the replacement of one form of private ownership with another, and the replacement of the rule of some exploiters with the rule of other exploiters. Since all exploitative social forms have the same type of foundation—private ownership of the means of production—new economic elements gradually mature within the old mode of production. For example, bourgeois revolutions usually begin when relatively ready-made capitalist economic forms have already grown and matured within the feudal system. The basic task of the bourgeois revolution boils down to the bourgeoisie seizing power and making this power suitable for the existing capitalist economy. Bourgeois revolutions usually end with the seizure of power.
    The aim of the proletarian revolution is to replace private ownership of the means of production with public ownership and to eliminate all forms of exploitation of man by man. It encounters no ready-made socialist economic forms. Socialist elements based on public ownership of the means of production cannot grow within bourgeois society, which is based on private ownership. The task of the proletarian revolution is to establish proletarian state power and build a new socialist economy. The working class's seizure of power is only the beginning of the proletarian revolution, and state power is used as a lever to transform the old economy and organize the new economy.
    Therefore, the replacement of capitalism with the socialist system requires a special transition period, including an entire historical era, in each country. "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." [1]
    The transition period from capitalism to socialism begins with the establishment of proletarian state power and ends with the construction of socialism—the first stage of communist society. During the transition period, in the country that is realizing the proletarian revolution, the old capitalist foundation is eliminated, the new socialist foundation is established, and the development of productive forces necessary for socialist victory is guaranteed. During the transition period, the proletariat should train itself into a force capable of managing the state, building a socialist society, and transforming the petty-bourgeois masses in a socialist spirit.
    Based on the principles of Marx and Engels, Lenin created a complete theory of the transition period from capitalism to socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, arming the working class and all laborers with scientific knowledge of the methods of building socialism.
    The proletarian revolution first won victory in Russia. Russia had a level of capitalist development sufficient to enable the proletarian revolution to achieve victory. At the same time, Russia was the focal point of all the contradictions of imperialism, which greatly promoted the revolutionization of the proletariat and the process of the peasant masses uniting around it. In October 1917, the Russian proletariat, led by the Communist Party and armed with Lenin's theory of socialist revolution, allied with the poor peasants, overthrew the rule of the capitalists and landlords, and established its own dictatorship. The Great October Socialist Revolution, for the first time in human history, opened up the path to socialism and set an example of what the proletarian revolution in any country should fundamentally be like. At the same time, the socialist revolution in every country that has broken away from the imperialist system inevitably has its own characteristics, which are generated by the specific historical conditions of the country's development and the international environment.
    Lenin discovered and scientifically demonstrated the possibility of non-capitalist development for countries that are lagging behind in socio-economic terms under certain historical conditions. After shaking off the shackles of imperialism, these countries, with the help of advanced countries where the proletarian revolution has already won victory, can avoid the long and painful process of capitalist development and gradually embark on the road of building socialism by bypassing the capitalist stage.
    The Dictatorship of the Proletariat is the Tool for Building a Socialist Economy
    Since the task of the proletarian revolution is to eliminate all exploitation, it cannot but destroy the old state machinery aimed at suppressing the working masses. The proletarian revolution gives rise to a new type of state—the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the political superstructure of the dictatorship of the proletariat, there can be no economic liberation of the laborers and no transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat is the state leadership of society by the working class. All previous forms of the state were for the interests of a minority of exploiters to suppress the majority of the exploited. The dictatorship of the proletariat, on the other hand, is for the interests of the majority of laborers to suppress the minority of exploiters.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat is true democracy, representing the vital interests of the laborers. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the laborers become the masters of their own country for the first time in history. While the bourgeois revolution, in consolidating new forms of capitalist exploitation, cannot unite the exploited working masses around the bourgeoisie for a considerable period of time, the proletarian revolution, which eliminates all exploitation, can and should enable these masses to form a long-term alliance with the proletariat. The alliance of the working class and the peasantry, led by the working class and aimed against the exploiting classes, is the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without this alliance, it is impossible to consolidate the proletarian regime and to build a socialist economy.
    The dictatorship of the proletariat is the continuation of the class struggle of the proletariat against domestic exploiters and against the aggressive forces of capitalist encirclement under new conditions and in new forms. "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a persistent struggle—bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative—against the forces and traditions of the old society." [2]
    Corresponding to the tasks of building socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat has three basic aspects. It means that the proletariat uses state power, first, to suppress the exploiters, defend the country, and strengthen its ties with the proletarians of other countries; second, to finally sever the ties of the exploited working masses with the bourgeoisie, consolidate the alliance of the proletariat with these masses, and attract these masses to participate in the cause of socialist construction; and third, to build a new socialist society.
    The political superstructure of the dictatorship of the proletariat arises from the urgent economic need of society to transition from capitalism to socialism. However, once the dictatorship of the proletariat, this tool for building a socialist economy, is born, it itself becomes an extremely great force. It actively promotes the formation and consolidation of its socialist base, ensures the elimination of the old capitalist base, and ensures the victory of socialist economic forms over capitalist economic forms.
    Socialist economic forms cannot arise and develop spontaneously or haphazardly. They arise and develop due to the planned activities of the proletarian state and due to the creative initiative of the working masses.
    The proletarian state can only accomplish its task of establishing a new foundation by relying on the objective economic laws that relations of production must correspond to the nature of the productive forces, and by relying on the new economic laws that arise on the basis of the new economic conditions. The dictatorship of the proletariat guarantees the creation of a higher type of social labor organization than capitalism. This is the mainspring of the strength of the socialist system and its victory over the capitalist system.
    Forms of the proletarian state can vary. "The transition from capitalism to communism is certainly bound to yield a tremendous abundance and variety of political forms, but the essence will inevitably be the same: the dictatorship of the proletariat." [3] This fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism has been fully confirmed by the historical experience of the Soviet Union, which established the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat discovered by Lenin—Soviet power—and subsequently by the historical experience of countries where the dictatorship of the proletariat exists in the form of people's democracy.
    Leadership of the entire process of planned socialist economic construction in the state of proletarian dictatorship belongs to the Communist Party (Workers' Party). These parties, armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the knowledge of the laws of economic development of society, are organizing and guiding the people to solve the tasks of socialist construction.
    Socialist Nationalization
    The development of capitalism makes the socialist socialization of large-scale machine industry, mechanized transportation, banks, etc., economically necessary and possible. Therefore, the proletarian state at the beginning of the transition period implements the nationalization of large capitalist production, thereby depriving capitalists of their economic dominance.
    Socialist nationalization is the revolutionary expropriation of the property of the exploiting classes by the proletarian regime and its transformation into socialist property of the state—property of the whole people. Socialist nationalization leads to the elimination of the basic contradiction of capitalism—the contradiction between the social character of production and the private capitalist form of appropriation.
    Of decisive significance for socialist construction is the nationalization of large-scale industry, which is the leading sector of the national economy. In addition, the nationalization of banks, railway transportation, merchant shipping and post and telecommunications, large commercial enterprises, and foreign trade is implemented. Through the nationalization of banks, the bourgeoisie loses a very important lever for maintaining its economic rule, and the proletarian state obtains a centralized and vast economic institution that, after revolutionary transformation, can be used to build socialism. The nationalization of foreign trade is a necessary condition for ensuring that the country, which is building socialism, is economically independent of the capitalist world.
    Socialist nationalization, first, is the expropriation of the means of production from the capitalists, thereby eliminating the economic rule of the bourgeoisie domestically; second, it lays the economic foundation for the dictatorship of the proletariat and transfers the lifelines of the national economy, namely the leading economic sectors, into the hands of the laborers. The foundation of socialist relations of production, that is, public ownership of the means of production, is established in these sectors.
    In view of the urgent need to eliminate the remnants of serfdom and the remnants of the long-outdated landlord land ownership system, the proletarian state immediately confiscates the land and farms of large landowners, along with draft animals and farm implements. Most of the confiscated land is handed over to the working peasants. Large-scale state-owned agricultural enterprises are organized on a small portion of the confiscated land. One of the most important measures of the socialist revolution is land nationalization, that is, the elimination of private land ownership and the transfer of land to the proletarian state. The question of the form and duration of implementing complete land nationalization is to be resolved by the proletarian regime according to the specific conditions of each country. In Russia, since the tradition of private land ownership among the peasants was not as long as in Western Europe, the Soviet regime implemented complete land nationalization at the beginning of the revolution in accordance with the demands of the peasant masses. Thus, absolute rent ceased to exist. For the first time in history, Soviet peasants received land from the proletarian revolution for free use. In those countries where the private land ownership of small farmers has existed for a long time and where the tradition of private land ownership among the peasants is longer, the working class, after seizing power, does not implement complete land nationalization at the beginning of the revolution. In these countries, only a part of the land confiscated from large landowners is nationalized and becomes state land; most of the confiscated land is privately owned by the peasants. The question of complete land nationalization is practically resolved in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture.
    After destroying the state apparatus of the bourgeoisie, the Great October Socialist Revolution nationalized the means of production and other wealth of landlords and large capitalists in the first few months, expropriating them without any compensation. The Land Decree was promulgated on October 26 (November 8), 1917. The land of landlords, the bourgeoisie, the royal family, churches, and monasteries was confiscated without any compensation. Private land ownership was abolished forever. All land, minerals, forests, and waterways became the property of the state (property of the whole people). The buying and selling of land was prohibited. In addition to the land they had already used before the revolution, the peasants received more than 150 million acres of land for free use, and they no longer had to pay rent to the landlords, no longer paying a total of more than 700 million gold rubles annually for the cost of purchasing land. Land nationalization is the fundamental elimination of the landlord class. It means the complete eradication of the remnants of serfdom. In this way, the socialist revolution completely solved the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution along the way. Land nationalization itself has not yet established socialist relations of production in the countryside, because private management continues on the land that has become the property of the whole people. But it is of great significance for socialist construction. Land nationalization strengthened the economic foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and improved the economic conditions of the working peasants. It later promoted the peasants to embark on the road of socialist development.
    As a transitional measure for the widespread nationalization of capitalist enterprises, and in order to carry out certain adjustments to the activities of these enterprises, the Soviet regime implemented workers' control, that is, the supervision of production, transactions, and finances by all workers of these enterprises. Bank nationalization was implemented in December 1917. The Soviet regime abolished all debts of the Tsarist government and the Provisional Government to foreign and domestic capitalists. The state monopoly of foreign trade was declared, and the import and export of goods were transferred from private hands to state organs. The state monopoly of foreign trade implemented by the Soviet regime is a bulwark, reliably protecting the country from the economic aggression of the imperialists who sought to enslave it and turn it into their colony. Railways and post and telecommunications, maritime and large inland waterway merchant ships became the property of the whole people. The Soviet regime increasingly widely implemented the nationalization of industrial enterprises by means of confiscation without compensation. The nationalization of large enterprises in all industrial sectors was announced in June 1918.
    The nationalization of large-scale industry, banks, transportation, and foreign trade meant that the Soviet regime had destroyed the economic power of the bourgeoisie and grasped the lifelines of the national economy.
    In the nationalized enterprises, capitalist relations of production were replaced by socialist relations of production. The means of production became public property and were no longer capital. The phenomenon of exploitation of man by man was eliminated. A new socialist labor discipline was implemented. Socialist competition was launched among the workers. The principle of socialist production management, which combines one-man management with the creative initiative of the masses, was gradually established.
    In overcoming the resistance of the bourgeoisie and the sabotage and sabotage of bourgeois experts, and in carrying out a tenacious struggle against the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, the Soviet regime began to organize the nationwide statistics and supervision of the production and distribution of products.
    Economic Components and Classes in the Transition Period. The Alliance of the Working Class and the Peasantry
    Due to the nationalization of large-scale industry, transportation, banks, etc., socialist economic components emerged. In addition to the socialist component based on public ownership of the means of production, there also existed components inherited from the past and based on private ownership of the means of production (i.e., economic forms) during the transition period. This means that the economy of the transition period was multi-component.
    As Lenin pointed out, there were the following five economic components in the Soviet Union during the transition period: (1) patriarchal peasant economy, (2) small commodity production, (3) private capitalism, (4) state capitalism, (5) socialist component.
    The patriarchal peasant economy is based on individual labor and is a small, almost entirely natural economy, that is, it produces products mostly for its own consumption.
    Small commodity production is an economy based on individual labor and has a greater degree of connection with the market. This is mostly the middle peasant economy, which produces the main part of commercial grain, as well as the family handicraft economy that does not use hired labor. During a considerable period of time in the transition period, the small commodity component encompassed the majority of the country's residents.
    Representing private capitalism are the most numerous exploiting class—the rich peasants, the owners of non-nationalized, mainly medium and small capitalist industrial enterprises, and merchants. Hired labor is used in capitalist enterprises, labor power is still a commodity, and relations of exploitation and surplus value exist.
    State capitalism mainly existed in the form of concession enterprises leased by the Soviet regime to foreign capitalists and certain state-owned enterprises leased to capitalists. State capitalism under the dictatorship of the proletariat is essentially different from state capitalism under bourgeois rule. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, state capitalism is an economic component strictly limited by the proletarian regime and used by it to fight against the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie and to carry out socialist construction. In the economy of the Soviet Union, state capitalism occupied a very small position.
    The socialist component includes, first of all, the factories, transportation, banks, state farms, commercial enterprises and other enterprises in the hands of the Soviet state, and secondly, cooperatives (consumer cooperatives, supply cooperatives, credit cooperatives, production cooperatives, including their advanced form, collective farms). The foundation of the socialist component is large-scale machine industry. Even at the beginning of the transition period, the socialist component, a higher economic type than all other components, began to play a leading role in the country's economy.
    In the socialist economy, labor power is no longer a commodity, and labor has lost the nature of hired labor, becoming labor for oneself and for one's own society. Surplus value does not exist. The work of nationalized enterprises, within the scope of various departments, and later within the scope of the entire state-owned economy, gradually became planned. Due to the establishment of the socialist ownership of the means of production, the products produced in state-owned enterprises no longer belong to the capitalists, but to the state, that is, to all working people.
    The existence of all these five economic components is not inevitable for every country building socialism. As Lenin taught, and as historical experience now confirms, each country has the following basic socio-economic forms in the transition period from capitalism to socialism: socialism, small commodity production, capitalism. The classes corresponding to these socio-economic forms are: the working class, the petty bourgeoisie (especially the peasants), and the bourgeoisie. The main features of the economic, class relations, and the economic policy basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the transition period are common to all countries, which does not exclude, but rather presupposes, that each country has its own characteristics.
    The position of each class in the transition period has undergone fundamental changes compared to its position under the capitalist system.
    The working class has transformed from an oppressed class under the capitalist system into a ruling class, holding state power and owning the means of production socialized by the state together with all the laborers. The material conditions of the working class are constantly improving, and their cultural level is constantly rising.
    The peasants, that is, the poor and middle peasant masses, have received land from the socialist state, freed themselves from the shackles of the landlords, are not subject to the oppression of the rich peasants, and receive comprehensive economic and cultural assistance. Due to the help of the October Revolution and the Soviet regime, the middle and poor peasants had already produced more than 4 billion poods of grain in the 1926-1927 fiscal year, while before the revolution they only produced 2.5 billion poods annually.
    The small commodity production of the peasants inevitably generates capitalist elements, and the class differentiation of the peasants into poor and rich peasants is taking place. However, the peasant differentiation process in the transition period has a different nature from that under the capitalist system. Under capitalist conditions, the number of poor and rich peasants in the countryside increases day by day, while the number of middle peasants is constantly decreasing, and they go bankrupt in large numbers and supplement the ranks of the poor peasants and the proletariat. In the Soviet Union during the transition period, before the basic peasant masses embarked on the socialist road, the number and proportion of middle peasants increased due to the decrease in the number of poor peasants, that is, due to a part of them rising to the level of middle peasants; however, the scale of the increase in the number of rich peasants was much smaller than under the capitalist system, and the middle peasants became the central figure in agriculture.
    After the October Revolution, as early as 1918, the middle peasants had already occupied a dominant position among the peasants. This happened because the peasants obtained land free of charge, as well as a portion of the livestock and farm implements of the landlords. In 1918, a partial expropriation of the rich peasants was implemented, and 50 million hectares of land were confiscated from the rich peasants and handed over to the poor and middle peasants. In the 1928-1929 fiscal year, among all peasant households, poor peasants accounted for 35 percent, middle peasants accounted for 60 percent, and rich peasants accounted for 4 to 5 percent.
    During the transition period, the Soviet regime was guided by Lenin's following formula in its policy towards the peasants: firmly unite with the middle peasants, rely on the poor peasants, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the rich peasants. Lenin taught that the working class, when leading the peasants, should always distinguish between the two aspects of the peasants—laborers and private owners.
    The middle peasant is, by his nature, dual: as a laborer, he tends towards the proletariat; as a small private owner, he tends towards the bourgeoisie. Both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat strive to win the middle peasant masses over to their side. At the same time, the working class pays attention to the fundamental interests of the peasants as laborers, while the bourgeoisie attempts to use the interests of the peasants as private owners. During the transition period, especially when the peasants still base their survival on private ownership and small commodity production, there are certain non-antagonistic contradictions between the working class and the peasants, such as on the issue of prices and on the issue of tax rates. But these contradictions are not fundamental. On fundamental issues, the interests of the working class and the peasant working masses are consistent: both classes have a vital interest in the elimination of exploitation and the victory of socialism. The foundation of the solid alliance of two fraternal classes—the working class and the peasantry—lies in this.
    The principle of the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, with the working class playing a leading role, is the foundation of socialist construction. The resolution of the Twelfth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stated: "The party's extremely important political task, which determines the entire outcome of the revolution, is to protect and develop the alliance of the working class and the peasantry with the utmost attention and care." [4]
    The solid alliance of the working class and the peasantry is a necessary condition for the correct economic relations between cities and countryside, between industry and agriculture, and is a necessary condition for the upsurge of agriculture and its socialist transformation. Only on the basis of the alliance of the working class and the peasantry can the elimination of capitalist economic forms and the victory of socialism be guaranteed.
    The working class and the peasantry are the basic classes of the transition period.
    The bourgeoisie, which has lost state power and the main means of production, is no longer one of the basic classes of society. Large capitalists and a considerable part of the urban middle bourgeoisie were deprived of the means of production at the beginning of the transition period. But after this, a part of the urban bourgeoisie remained, as well as the rural bourgeoisie—the rich peasants. The bourgeoisie still retained considerable strength for several years during the transition period. This is because the spontaneous generation of capitalist elements from the small commodity economy is inevitable, and it is impossible to replace the capitalist economy with the socialist economy in all economic sectors all at once. Even after losing its rule, the bourgeoisie still retains money and materials to some extent, and maintains contact with a considerable number of old experts. It relies on the support of international capital.
    The basic contradiction of the transition period economy is the contradiction between socialism and capitalism. The former is nascent, but initially weak, and the future belongs to it; the latter is overthrown, but initially strong, has its roots in the small commodity economy, and it is a thing of the past. In all areas of the economic life of the transition period, the struggle between socialism and capitalism unfolds according to the principle of "who will win." On the one hand is the working class and the basic peasant masses, and on the other hand is the bourgeoisie, between whom there is an antagonistic and irreconcilable contradiction. For the transition period, the sharpening of the class struggle of the proletariat and the working masses against the bourgeoisie is lawful, because the resistance of the bourgeoisie strengthens with the development of socialist construction.

    从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的基本特点
    ——“政治经济学教科书”第二十二章
    编者按：苏联国家政治书籍出版局最近出版的“政治经济学教科书”，共包括序言，导言，第一篇、资本主义前的生产方式，第二篇、资本主义的生产方式，第三篇、社会主义的生产方式，结束语等部分，约五十多万字。关于该书的主要内容，本报十月二十三日第三版已译载专文介绍。现在我们为了满足广大读者的迫切需要，特从该书第三篇中选择若干章陆续发表。
    无产阶级革命和从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的必然性
    资本主义生产方式的发展和资产阶级社会中的阶级斗争的整个进程，不可避免地会使社会主义革命地代替资本主义。前面已经表明，在帝国主义时代，成长起来的生产力和已经成为这些生产力的桎梏的资产阶级生产关系之间的冲突，达到空前尖锐的程度。生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则要求消灭旧的资产阶级的生产关系和建立新的社会主义的生产关系。由此就产生无产阶级革命，即社会主义革命的客观必然性。
    由于资产阶级社会基础和社会主义社会基础的对立，由于劳动利益和资本利益的对抗，机会主义者所鼓吹的资本主义的和平“长入”社会主义是不可能的。从资本主义到社会主义的过渡，只有通过无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政才能实现。无产阶级由于自己的经济地位，是能够把一切劳动者团结在自己周围来推翻资本主义和取得社会主义胜利的唯一的阶级。
    无产阶级革命和它以前的一切革命有原则性的区别。从奴隶制度过渡到封建制度和从封建制度过渡到资本主义制度时，都是一种私有制形式被另一种私有制形式所代替，一些剥削者的政权被另一些剥削者的政权所更换。由于一切剥削者的社会形态都具有同一类型的基础——生产资料的私有制，新的经济成分是在旧的生产方式内部逐渐成熟起来的。例如资产阶级革命通常是在比较现成的资本主义经济形式还在封建制度内部就已成长和成熟起来的时候开始的。资产阶级革命的基本任务归结起来是资产阶级夺取政权，使这个政权适合于现存的资本主义经济。资产阶级革命通常以夺取政权而告完成。
    无产阶级革命的目的是以生产资料的公有制代替私有制和消灭一切人剥削人的现象。它遇不到任何现成的社会主义经济形式。以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义成分不能在以私有制为基础的资产阶级社会内部成长起来。无产阶级革命的任务在于建立无产阶级政权，建成新的社会主义的经济。工人阶级取得政权只是无产阶级革命的开始，同时政权是用来改造旧经济和组织新经济的杠杆。
    因此，社会主义制度之代替资本主义制度要求每个国家有一个包括整个历史时代的特殊的过渡时期。“在资本主义社会和共产主义社会之间有一个前者变为后者的革命转变时期。与这个时期相适应的是一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期的国家不能是别的任何东西，只能是无产阶级的革命的专政。”〔一〕
    从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期开始于无产阶级政权的建立，完成于社会主义——共产主义社会的第一阶段——的建成。在过渡时期内，在实现着无产阶级革命的国家里，旧的资本主义的基础被消灭，新的社会主义的基础建立起来，社会主义胜利所必需的生产力的发展获得保证。在过渡时期内，无产阶级应当把自己锻炼成一支能够管理国家、建成社会主义社会并以社会主义精神改造小资产阶级群众的力量。
    列宁以马克思和恩格斯的原理为依据，创立了关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期和无产阶级专政的完整学说，用建成社会主义的方法的科学知识武装了工人阶级，武装了所有的劳动者。
    无产阶级革命首先在俄国获得了胜利。俄国有足以使无产阶级革命取得胜利的资本主义发展水平。同时俄国是帝国主义一切矛盾的集合点，这就大大促进了无产阶级的革命化和农民群众团结在它的周围的过程。一九一七年十月，以共产党为领导的、以列宁的社会主义革命理论武装起来的俄国无产阶级同贫农结成联盟，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了自己的专政。伟大的十月社会主义革命在人类历史上第一次开辟了走向社会主义的道路，树立了一个榜样，表明任何一个国家的无产阶级革命基本上应当是怎样的。同时，每一个脱离了帝国主义体系的国家的社会主义革命必然具有自己的特点，这些特点是由这个国家发展的具体历史条件和国际环境所产生的。
    列宁发现了并科学地论证了在社会经济方面落后的国家在一定历史条件下的非资本主义发展道路的可能性。这些国家在摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁之后，靠着无产阶级革命已经获得胜利的先进国家的帮助，可以避免资本主义发展的漫长而痛苦的过程，并绕过资本主义阶段，逐步走上建设社会主义的道路。
    无产阶级专政是建成社会主义经济的工具
    既然无产阶级革命的任务是消灭一切剥削，它就不能不毁坏旨在压制劳动群众的旧的国家机器。无产阶级革命产生出新型的国家——无产阶级专政。没有无产阶级专政这一政治的上层建筑，就不可能有劳动者的经济上的解放，就不可能从资本主义的生产方式过渡到社会主义的生产方式。
    无产阶级专政是工人阶级对社会实行国家领导。以往一切形式的国家都是为了少数剥削者的利益而压制大多数被剥削者。无产阶级专政则是为了大多数劳动者的利益而压制少数剥削者。
    无产阶级专政是真正的民主，它代表着劳动者的切身利益。在无产阶级专政的条件下，劳动者在历史上第一次成为自己国家的主人。资产阶级革命在巩固新的资本主义的剥削形式时，不能在相当长的时期内把被剥削的劳动群众团结在资产阶级周围，而消灭一切剥削的无产阶级革命却能够而且应当使这些群众同无产阶级结成长期的联盟。以工人阶级为领导的旨在反对剥削阶级的工人阶级同农民的联盟，是无产阶级专政的最高原则。没有这个联盟，就不可能巩固无产阶级政权，就不可能建成社会主义经济。
    无产阶级专政是无产阶级的阶级斗争在反对国内剥削者、反对资本主义包围的侵略势力的新条件下和新形式下的继续。“无产阶级专政就是对旧社会势力及其传统进行顽强的斗争，进行流血的和不流血的、暴力的和和平的、军事的和经济的、教育的和行政的斗争。”〔二〕
    和建成社会主义的任务相适应，无产阶级专政有三个基本的方面。它意味着无产阶级利用政权，第一，来镇压剥削者，保卫国家，加强自己和其他国家的无产者的联系；第二，来最后割断被剥削的劳动群众同资产阶级的联系，巩固无产阶级同这些群众的联盟，吸引这些群众参加社会主义建设事业；第三，来建成新的社会主义社会。
    无产阶级专政这一政治的上层建筑，是由于社会在经济上迫切地需要从资本主义过渡到社会主义而产生的。但是，无产阶级专政这个建成社会主义经济的工具一诞生，它本身就成为一个极其伟大的力量。它积极促使自己的社会主义的基础形成和巩固起来，保证消灭旧的资本主义的基础，保证社会主义的经济形式战胜资本主义的经济形式。
    社会主义经济形式不能自发地、自流地产生和发展。它们是由于无产阶级国家的有计划的活动、由于劳动群众的创造积极性而产生和发展的。
    无产阶级的国家只有依靠生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的客观的经济法则，依靠在新的经济条件的基础上产生的新的经济法则，才能完成自己的建立新基础的任务。无产阶级专政保证创立起比资本主义更高的社会劳动组织类型。社会主义制度的力量及其对资本主义制度的胜利的主要泉源就在于此。
    无产阶级国家的形式可能是各不相同的。“从资本主义过渡到共产主义，当然不能不产生极其丰富的和各种各样的政治形式，但其本质却不免是同一的，这就是无产阶级专政。”〔三〕马克思列宁主义的这一基本原理，已由确立了列宁所发现的无产阶级专政形式——苏维埃政权——的苏联的历史经验，随后又由存在着以人民民主为形式的无产阶级专政的国家的历史经验所完全证实了。
    对有计划的社会主义经济建设的整个过程的领导，在无产阶级专政的国家里是属于共产党（工人党）的。这些以马克思列宁主义的理论、以社会的经济发展法则的知识武装起来的政党，正在组织和指导人民群众去解决社会主义建设的任务。
    社会主义国有化
    资本主义的发展使大机器工业、机械化运输业、银行等等的社会主义社会化在经济上成为必要和可能。因此，无产阶级国家在过渡时期开始时就实行大资本主义生产的国有化，从而剥夺资本家在经济上的统治地位。
    社会主义国有化就是无产阶级政权用革命手段没收剥削阶级的财产并将其变为国家的社会主义的财产——全民的财产。社会主义国有化导致资本主义的基本矛盾——生产的社会性和占有的私人资本主义形式之间的矛盾的消除。
    对社会主义建设具有决定意义的，是作为国民经济主导部门的大工业的国有化。除此以外，还实行银行、铁路运输业、商船和邮电、大的商业企业的国有化，以及对外贸易的国有化。由于银行国有化，资产阶级就失去一个维持它的经济统治的极重要的杠杆，而无产阶级国家则获得一个既集中而又庞大的经济机构，这个机构加以革命改造后，可以用来建设社会主义。对外贸易的国有化是保证正在建设社会主义的国家在经济上不依赖于资本主义世界而独立自主的必要条件。
    社会主义国有化，第一是剥夺资本家的生产资料，从而消灭资产阶级在国内的经济统治；第二是为无产阶级专政打下经济基础，把国民经济命脉即主导的经济部门转到劳动者手中。在这些部门中确立起生产资料公有制这一社会主义生产关系的基础。
    鉴于迫切需要消灭农奴制的残余，消灭早已过时的地主土地占有制的残余，无产阶级国家实行立即没收大土地占有者的土地及其农场，连同耕畜和农具在内。没收来的土地绝大部分都交给劳动农民。在一小部分没收来的土地上则组织起大规模的国营农业企业。社会主义革命的最重要的措施之一就是土地国有化，即消灭土地私有制并把土地转归无产阶级国家所有。实行全部土地国有化的方式和期限的问题要由无产阶级政权根据每个国家的具体条件加以解决。在俄国，由于农民中土地私有制的传统没有西欧那样悠久，苏维埃政权根据农民群众的要求在革命一开始时就实行了全部土地国有化。从而绝对地租就不存在了。苏联农民在历史上第一次从无产阶级革命手中得到土地来无偿使用。在小农的土地私有制长时期存在因而农民中的土地私有制的传统较为悠久的那些国家里，工人阶级掌握了政权以后，并不在革命开始时就实行全部土地国有化。在这些国家中，从大土地所有者那里没收来的土地，只有一部分收归国有，成为国家土地；没收来的土地大部分都归农民私有。全部土地国有化的问题是在农业的社会主义改造的进程中实际地得到解决的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在破坏了资产阶级的国家机构以后，在最初几个月内就把地主和大资本家的生产资料及其他财富国有化，不给任何代价地加以剥夺了。一九一七年十月二十六日（十一月八日）颁布了土地法令。不给任何代价地没收了地主、资产阶级、皇室、教堂和寺院的土地。永远废除了土地私有权。一切土地、矿藏、森林、水流都成了国家的财产（全民的财产）。禁止土地买卖。农民除他们在革命前就已使用的土地外，获得了一亿五千万俄亩以上的土地来无偿使用，他们再不用向地主缴纳地租，每年不再付出总计在七亿金卢布以上的购买土地的费用。土地国有化就是根本消灭地主阶级。它意味着完全根除农奴制的残余。这样，社会主义革命就顺便彻底解决了资产阶级民主革命的任务。土地国有化本身还没有在农村中建立起社会主义的生产关系，因为在已经成为全民财产的土地上继续进行着私人的经营。但它对于社会主义建设有巨大的意义。土地国有化加强了无产阶级专政的经济基础，改善了劳动农民的经济状况。它在后来促使了农民走上社会主义发展的道路。
    作为广泛实行资本主义企业国有化的过渡办法，并为了对这些企业的活动进行一定的调整，苏维埃政权施行了工人监督，即这些企业的全体工作者对生产，交易和财务的监督。一九一七年十二月实行了银行国有化。苏维埃政权废除了沙皇政府和临时政府对外国和本国资本家的一切债务。宣布了对外贸易由国家垄断，商品的输入和输出由私人手里转归国家机关掌握。苏维埃政权实行的对外贸易垄断制是一座壁垒，可靠地保护着国家不受那些力图奴役它，把它变为自己的殖民地的帝国主义者的经济侵略。铁路和邮电、海运和大的内河航运的商船都成了全民的财产。苏维埃政权日益广泛地用不给赎金的没收的办法实行了工业企业的国有化。一九一八年六月宣布了一切工业部门的大企业的国有化。
    大工业、银行、运输业、对外贸易的国有化意味着苏维埃政权摧毁了资产阶级的经济力量并掌握了国民经济命脉。
    在国有化的企业中，资本主义的生产关系被社会主义的生产关系代替了。生产资料成为公共财产，不再是资本了。人剥削人的现象消灭了。新的社会主义的劳动纪律实行起来了。工人中发起了社会主义竞赛。把一长制和群众的创造积极性结合着的社会主义生产管理原则逐渐确立起来了。
    苏维埃政权在克服资产阶级的反抗及资产阶级专家的暗害和怠工时，在和小资产阶级自发势力进行顽强的斗争中，着手组织了产品的生产和分配的全国性的统计和监督。
    过渡时期的经济成分和阶级。工人阶级同农民的联盟
    由于大工业、运输业、银行等等的国有化，产生了社会主义的经济成分。除了以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义成分，在过渡时期还存在着从过去继承下来的、以生产资料私有制为基础的成分
  （即经济形式）。这就是说，过渡时期的经济是多成分的。
    如列宁所指出的，苏联在过渡时期有下列五种经济成分：（一）宗法制的农民经济，（二）小商品生产，（三）私人资本主义，（四）国家资本主义，（五）社会主义成分。
    宗法制的农民经济以个人劳动为基础，是小的差不多是完全的自然经济，就是说，它生产的产品绝大部分是供自己消费的。
    小商品生产是以个人劳动为基础并与市场有较大程度的联系的经济。这多半是生产商品粮食的主要部分的中农经济，以及不使用雇佣劳动的家庭手工业经济。在过渡时期中相当长的一段时间内，小商品成分囊括着全国大多数的居民。
    代表私人资本主义的是一个人数最多的剥削阶级——富农，非国有化的、主要是中小资本主义工业企业的所有者，以及商人。在资本主义企业中使用着雇佣劳动，劳动力仍然是商品，存在着剥削关系和剩余价值。
    国家资本主义存在的形式主要是苏维埃政权租让给外国资本家的租让企业和租给资本家的某些属于国家的企业。无产阶级专政下的国家资本主义和资产阶级统治下的国家资本主义有本质上的差别。在无产阶级专政下，国家资本主义是受无产阶级政权严格限制并被它用来和小资产阶级自发势力进行斗争、用来进行社会主义建设的经济成分。在苏联的经济中，国家资本主义占极小的地位。
    社会主义成分所包括的首先是苏维埃国家手中的工厂、运输业、银行、国营农场、商业企业及其他企业，其次是合作社（消费合作社、供应合作社、信用合作社、生产合作社，包括其高级形式集体农庄在内）。社会主义成分的基础是大机器工业。还在过渡时期开始时，社会主义成分这一比其他一切成分都高的经济类型就开始在国家的经济中起领导作用。
    在社会主义经济中，劳动力不再是商品，劳动失去了雇佣劳动的性质，变成了为自己、为自己的社会的劳动。剩余价值不存在了。国有化企业的工作，在各个部门的范围内，以后又在整个国营经济的范围内，逐渐地走向计划化了。由于生产资料的社会主义所有制的确立，国营企业中生产出来的产品已不归资本家所有，而归国家即归全体劳动人民所有了。
    所有这五种经济成分的存在并非对每个建设社会主义的国家都是不可避免的。如列宁所教导的，也如现在历史经验所证实的，每个国家在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期中都有下列几种基本的社会经济形式：社会主义，小商品生产，资本主义。与这些社会经济形式相适应的阶级是：工人阶级，小资产阶级（特别是农民），资产阶级。过渡时期的经济、阶级关系以及无产阶级专政的经济政策基础的主要特征，对一切国家来说都是共同的，这并不排除每个国家都有自己的特点，相反地，而是以此为前提。
    各阶级在过渡时期的地位同它们在资本主义制度下的地位比起来是有根本变化的。
    工人阶级从资本主义制度下的被压迫阶级变成了统治阶级，掌握着政权，并和全体劳动者一起占有由国家加以社会化的生产资料。工人阶级的物质状况不断改善，他们的文化水平不断提高。
    农民即贫农和中农群众从社会主义国家那里得到土地，摆脱了地主的束缚，不受富农的压迫，得到全面的经济上和文化上的帮助。由于十月革命和苏维埃政权的帮助，中农和贫农在一九二六—一九二七年度就已生产了四十亿普特以上的粮食，而在革命前他们每年只生产二十五亿普特。
    农民的小商品生产不可避免地产生资本主义分子，农民分为贫农和富农的阶级分化在进行着。但是过渡时期的农民分化过程具有不同于资本主义制度下的性质。在资本主义条件下，农村中贫农和富农日益增加，而中农则不断减少，他们大批地破产并补充贫农和无产阶级的队伍。苏联在过渡时期，在基本农民群众走上社会主义道路以前，由于贫农减少，即由于他们一部分上升到中农的水平，中农的人数和比重增长了；可是富农增长的规模却比资本主义制度下小得多，中农成了农业中的中心人物。
    十月革命后，还在一九一八年，中农就已在农民中占了优势。这种情形所以发生，是由于农民无偿地获得了土地，以及一部分地主的牲畜和农具。一九一八年对富农实行部分的剥夺，从富农那里没收来交给贫农和中农的土地有五千万公顷。在一九二八—一九二九年度，在所有农户中贫农占百分之三十五，中农占百分之六十，富农占百分之四到百分之五。
    在过渡时期，苏维埃政权在对待农民的政策上是以列宁的下列公式为指南的：巩固地联合中农，依靠贫农，和富农进行不可调和的斗争。列宁教导说，工人阶级在领导农民时，应当时时刻刻分清农民的两个方面——劳动者和私有者。
    中农按其本性说来是二重的：作为劳动者，他倾向于无产阶级；作为小私有者，他倾向于资产阶级。资产阶级和无产阶级都力图把中农群众争取到自己这方面来。同时，工人阶级注意作为劳动者的农民的根本利益，而资产阶级则企图利用农民的私有者的利益。在过渡时期，特别是在农民还把自己的生存建立在私有制和小商品生产上面的时候，工人阶级和农民之间是有某些非对抗性的矛盾的，例如在价格问题上，在税率问题上。但这些矛盾不是根本的。在根本问题上，工人阶级和农民劳动群众的利益是一致的：两个阶级对于剥削的消灭和社会主义的胜利都有切身的利益关系。两个友爱阶级——工人阶级同农民的巩固联盟的基础就在于此。
    工人阶级起领导作用的工人阶级同农民的联盟的原则，是社会主义建设的基础。俄共（布）第十二次代表大会的决议中说：“决定革命的整个结局的党的极重要的政治任务，就是要极注意地和最细心地保护和发展工人阶级同农民的联盟。”〔四〕
    工人阶级同农民的巩固的联盟是城市和乡村间、工业和农业间的正确经济关系的必要条件，是农业的高涨及其社会主义改造的必要条件。只有在工人阶级同农民的联盟的基础上才能保证资本主义经济形式的消灭和社会主义的胜利。
    工人阶级和农民是过渡时期的基本阶级。
    丧失政权和主要生产资料的资产阶级已经不是社会的基本阶级之一。大资本家和相当大一部分城市中等资产阶级在过渡时期开始时就被剥夺生产资料。但是在这以后还剩下一部分城市资产阶级，以及农村资产阶级——富农。在过渡时期的若干年中资产阶级还保有相当大的力量。这是由于从小商品经济中自发地产生资本主义分子是不可避免的，要一下子就在一切经济部门中以社会主义经济代替资本主义经济是不可能的。资产阶级就在失去自己的统治以后也还在某种程度上保有金钱和物资，同相当多的旧专家保有联系。它依靠国际资本的支持。
    过渡时期经济的基本矛盾是社会主义和资本主义之间的矛盾。前者是新生的，但是开始还弱，未来是属于它的；后者是被推翻的，但是起初还强，在小商品经济中有它的根源，它是过去的东西。在过渡时期的经济生活的一切领域中都按照“谁战胜谁”的原则展开着社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争。一方面是工人阶级和基本农民群众，另一方面是资产阶级，他们之间存在着对抗性的、不可调和的矛盾。在过渡时期，无产阶级国家开始是实行限制和排挤资本主义分子的政策。而以后就是实行完全消灭它们的政策。对于过渡时期来说，无产阶级、劳动群众反对资产阶级的阶级斗争的尖锐化是合乎规律的，因为资产阶级的反抗随着社会主义建设的开展而加强起来。
