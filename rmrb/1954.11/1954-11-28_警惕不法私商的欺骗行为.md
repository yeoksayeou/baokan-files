    Beware of Deceptive Practices by Illegal Private Merchants

    Reader Huang Shaobing writes: In May of this year, the Chengdu Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce, based on public exposure, conducted a comprehensive inspection of private shoe store owners in the city who used deceptive means to solicit orders and then delayed delivery. They were ordered to deliver all outstanding shoe orders by a specific deadline (detailed information was published in the "Letters to the Editor Summary" column on July 3rd). However, Wang Anguo, the owner of the private Jicheng Yong Shoe Store, not only failed to deliver the more than 490 pairs of shoes he owed as scheduled but also continued to engage in deceptive advertising, solicit orders, and embezzle payments. The Chengdu Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce issued several warnings without effect and transferred the facts of his crime to the Chengdu Municipal People's Court for legal processing. In order to uphold national laws and discipline and protect the interests of the people, the Chengdu Municipal People's Court convened a meeting of industrial and commercial households on October 22 this year, publicly sentencing the severely illegal merchant Wang Anguo to five years of imprisonment and ordering him to deliver all shoes to the ordering parties or refund payments within a specified period.

    The above facts illustrate that remaining vigilant, preventing, and punishing the deceptive practices of illegal private merchants is still a problem that requires constant attention in the future.

    警惕不法私商的欺骗行为
    读者黄韶兵来信：本年五月，成都市人民政府工商行政管理局曾根据群众的揭发，对市内私营皮鞋商用欺骗手段承揽订货后拖延不交的行为进行了全面检查，并责令各户限期交清承订的皮鞋（详细情况已在七月三日“读者来信摘要”栏发表）。但是，私营集成永皮鞋店老板王安国户不但不如期交清拖欠的四百九十多双皮鞋，而且还继续进行欺骗宣传，承揽订货，套用货款。成都市工商行政管理局几次提出警告，仍无效果，就将他的犯罪事实移请成都市人民法院依法处理。成都市人民法院为了维护国家法纪，保护人民群众利益，在今年十月二十二日召开工商户大会，公开判处严重不法奸商王安国徒刑五年，并限期向各地订户交清皮鞋或退还货款。
    以上事实说明了时刻提高警惕，防止和惩处不法私商的欺骗行为，仍然是今后要经常注意的问题。
