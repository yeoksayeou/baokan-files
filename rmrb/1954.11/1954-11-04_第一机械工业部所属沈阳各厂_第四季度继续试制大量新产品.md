The First Ministry of Machine Building's Factories in Shenyang
Continue to Trial-Produce a Large Number of New Products in the Fourth Quarter

The factories in Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machine Building will continue to trial-produce a large number of new products in the fourth quarter.

According to statistics from ten units, including Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant and the Second Machine Tool Plant, there are 147 new products being trial-produced in the fourth quarter, including those that continued from the third quarter. These include furnace top relief valves, large cover hammers, drum filters, etc. to support the Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking furnaces, and cylindrical mixers to support the Anshan Iron and Steel's sintering plant; high-voltage explosion-proof oil circuit breakers and complete electrical control equipment for combined coal mining machines for mines; working machine tools for manufacturing machines - new Soviet vertical drills, radial drills, large hexagonal lathes, etc.; as well as large main components trial-produced for the Guanting Reservoir's hydroelectric generators and rubber industry equipment such as light roll crushers, hook roll crushers, single-acting crushers, linked crushers, refining crushers and other rubber mixing equipment.

Many of these new products are designed according to Soviet blueprints and technical standards. As of October, most products have already begun trial production, and some have already been successfully trial-produced. At present, in order to ensure the successful trial production of new products and the completion of the annual new product trial production plan, various factories have actively adopted various effective measures. The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory established detailed rules for the trial production of new products, strengthened the leadership of trial production work, established full-time engineers, and conducted publicity and education work for all employees. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant organized professional meetings to study the trial production work, proposed measures and plans, and designated relevant units to have special personnel responsible for supervision and inspection to ensure the timely completion of tasks. Other units, such as the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Transformer Factory, and Electrical Machinery Factory, have also taken necessary measures.

The employees participating in the trial production of new products have very high production enthusiasm under the slogan of completing the national plan and supporting the liberation of Taiwan. All employees of the trial production section of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory proposed to strive to complete the annual new product trial production plan one month ahead of schedule.

    第一机械工业部所属沈阳各厂
    第四季度继续试制大量新产品
    第一机械工业部所属沈阳各厂、在第四季度继续试制大量新产品。
    据沈阳重型机器厂、第二机床厂等十个单位的统计，在第四季度试制和继续第三季度试制的新产品有一百四十七种。其中有支援鞍钢炼钢炉的炉顶放散阀，大盖重锤、鼓型过滤器等，和支援鞍钢烧结厂的圆筒混合机；有矿山用的高压防爆油断路器和联合采煤机的全套电器控制设备；有制造机器用的工作母机——苏联新式立钻、摇臂钻、大型六角车床等；还有为官厅水库水轮发电机试制的大型主要部件和橡胶工业用的光滚粉破机、勾滚粉碎机、单动粉碎机、联动粉碎机、精炼粉碎机等炼胶设备。
    这些新产品，许多种都是根据苏联图纸和技术标准设计的。在十月份，大部分产品都已经开始试制，有的已经试制成功。目前，各厂为了保证新产品试制成功和完成全年新产品的试制计划，都积极地采取了各种有效措施。沈阳高压开关厂建立了新产品试制细则，加强了试制工作的领导，设立了专职工程师，并向全体职工进行了宣传教育工作。沈阳重型机器厂组织专业会议研究了试制工作，提出了措施计划，并指定有关单位要有专人负责督促检查，保证按时完成任务。其他如沈阳水泵厂，变压器厂，电工机械厂等单位也都采取了必要措施。
    参加新产品试制工作的职工们，在完成国家计划、支援解放台湾的口号下，生产情绪非常高涨。沈阳水泵厂试作工段的全体职工，提出要争取提前一个月完成全年新产品试制计划。
