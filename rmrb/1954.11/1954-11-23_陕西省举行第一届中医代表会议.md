    陕西省举行第一届中医代表会议
    陕西省第一届中医代表会议十一日到十九日在西安举行。
    参加会议的代表总结了陕西省五年来中医工作的成就，检查了各级卫生行政部门在具体贯彻对待中医政策上存在的缺点，以及对待中医采取的歧视、轻视和排斥的粗暴态度。会议认为为使今后全省中医工作提高一步，首先必须切实纠正对待中医中药的错误观点，作好中西医团结工作；同时，中医也必须进一步钻研业务，发扬祖国优良的医学遗产，并学习现代科学知识；今后还应加强中医进修工作，整顿和发展中医联合医疗机构，成立中医学术研究的机构；加强中药的研究和管理工作。
    在会议进行期间，代表们作了临床医学经验的交流和学术报告，并提出了一百四十一件书面的建议和提案。许多代表还在会上贡献出五百一十六个秘方、验方和良方。　　　（新华社）
