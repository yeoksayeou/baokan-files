    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: On the 15th, the Czechoslovakian newspaper "Rudé Právo" published an editorial entitled "The Soviet Note Conforms to the Vital Interests of Our People." The editorial stated: "The Soviet Note emphasizes that the realization of the London and Paris Agreements will damage the possibility of resolving outstanding European issues. The Czechoslovak people, along with all peace-loving people, believe that the London and Paris Agreements must not be realized."
    Many Polish newspapers published editorials on the 15th commenting on the Soviet Note. The "Tribune of the People" editorial was titled "Hold Talks Immediately." The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Note is a major contribution to the struggle against the new plans to split Europe and turn West Germany into a breeding ground for aggression, which is flourishing in Europe. On the 16th, the "Tribune of the People" published another editorial entitled "The Voice of the Polish People," saying: "The Polish people welcome the Soviet proposal because the peaceful settlement of the German question and the prevention of the revival of German militarism are the main issues for the Polish people."
    Romania's "Scînteia" said in its editorial on the 16th, entitled "Collective Security and World and European Peace": "The Soviet government's note is a new and important action by the Soviet Union in its tireless concern for safeguarding world and European security. Its special significance lies in the fact that its purpose is to avoid the revival of German militarism and to avoid the formation of mutually hostile military and political blocs. It points out the possibility of establishing a collective security system on the basis of mutual respect for the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, large and small."
    Hungary's "Szabad Nép" published an editorial on the 15th, pointing out: "Considering the recent events, it will be clear that there is a reason why the date for the meeting proposed in the Soviet Note is so imminent. If the European countries want to do something before the Paris Agreement comes into effect, then there is still time before December to take measures to resolve the unresolved European issues in another way." The editorial pointed out: "As shown in the recent Soviet Note, the Soviet Union still believes that there are ways and possibilities to reach a mutually acceptable solution to the problem in a spirit of mutual consultation. The Hungarian people are very happy to participate in the meeting proposed by the Soviet Union."
    Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" pointed out in its editorial that the Soviet proposal is based on the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy. The editorial said: "The Bulgarian people and government wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's peaceful policy because maintaining and consolidating peace is an urgent task for the Bulgarian people, and it is inextricably linked to the people's democratic system and the country's transition to socialism."

    东欧人民民主国家报纸热烈拥护苏联建议
    据新华社讯：十五日，捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”刊载了题为“苏联照会符合我国人民的切身利益”的社论，社论写道：苏联照会着重指出实现伦敦和巴黎协定将损害解决欧洲悬而未决的问题的可能性，捷克斯洛伐克人民和全体爱好和平的人民一道认为，决不能实现伦敦和巴黎协定。
    波兰许多报纸在十五日发表了评论苏联照会的社论。“人民论坛报”社论的题目是“立刻举行会谈”。社论指出，苏联照会是对于正在欧洲蓬勃展开的反对分裂欧洲、反对把西德变成侵略策源地的新计划的斗争的重大贡献。十六日，“人民论坛报”又以“波兰人民的声音”为题发表社论说：波兰人民欢迎苏联建议，因为和平解决德国问题和防止德国军国主义复活是波兰人民的主要问题。
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”十六日在题为“集体安全和世界及欧洲的和平”的社论中说：苏联政府的照会是苏联不倦地关心保卫世界和欧洲安全的新的和重要的行动，它的特别的意义在于：它的目的是为了避免德国军国主义的复活和避免形成互相敌对的军事和政治集团，它指出了在一切大小国家互相尊重正当权益的基础上建立集体安全体系的可能性。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”十五日发表社论指出：考虑一下最近发生的事件，就会明白苏联照会所建议的会议日期很迫近这一点是有理由的了。如果欧洲各国想要在巴黎协定生效之前有所作为，那末在十二月以前还来得及采取措施以另一条道路解决还没有解决的欧洲问题。社论指出：正如苏联最近一次照会中所表明的，苏联仍旧认为，现在有办法有可能以互相协商的精神来使问题取得双方都能接受的解决。匈牙利人民十分乐于参加苏联建议召开的会议。
    保加利亚的“工人事业报”在社论中指出，苏联的建议的基础是苏联不变的和平外交政策。社论说：保加利亚人民和政府全心支持苏联的和平政策，因为维持和巩固和平是保加利亚人民迫切的任务，它和人民民主制度和国家向社会主义过渡有着不可分的联系。
