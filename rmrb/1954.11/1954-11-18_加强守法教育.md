    Strengthen Education on Law Abiding
    Over the past five years, the Chinese people have been able to effectively consolidate the fruits of their revolutionary victory and continuously achieve new victories in politics, economy, and culture. This is inseparable from the smooth development of the people's legal system construction. Now that our country's fundamental law—the Constitution of the People's Republic of China—has been adopted by the First National People's Congress at its first session, the construction of our country's legal system has entered a new stage. In the future, along with the formulation of our country's constitution, many laws will be formulated to make our country's laws more complete and substantial, so as to effectively guarantee the country's construction and protect the people's rights and interests.
    To build our country into a prosperous, happy, and great socialist country is the common aspiration of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the goal of our country's struggle as stipulated in our country's constitution. In order to prevent us from achieving this great goal, our enemies are constantly strengthening their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Various criminals in society, such as illegal bourgeois elements and rogue bandits, as well as degenerate elements who are hidden in state organs and who violate laws and discipline, are harming our great socialist cause to varying degrees. To ensure that the socialist cause is not harmed or damaged, we must constantly strengthen the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other saboteurs. Revolutionary law is a powerful weapon for carrying out this struggle.
    However, not everyone in our country understands the importance of the people's laws and the revolutionary legal system. Many people are deeply influenced by the traditional habits of the old society and deeply corroded by the ideology of the exploiting classes, so they continue to commit acts that violate the law. Therefore, we must universally strengthen education on law abiding and punish lawbreaking behavior.
    Some people think that the law is only for dealing with the enemy. We are workers and peasants, and it doesn't matter if we break the law a little bit; we won't be punished. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. These people fail to see that, in order for our laws to exert the greatest power in the struggle against enemy sabotage activities and in the struggle against all criminal acts, the people must actively safeguard their own laws and consciously abide by them, so as to ensure that the laws that represent the people's will have inviolable majesty and can be uniformly implemented throughout the country. Counter-revolutionaries and other criminals are able to carry out sabotage activities often because we have some gaps that they can exploit. If the people do not pay attention to abiding by the law, they will give enemies and lawbreakers opportunities. If everyone abides by the law, it will isolate the enemies and criminals, and it will be easier for the state to exert the power of the law and crack down on enemies and all criminals. We must firmly remember Lenin's words: "A slight violation of the law, a slight breach of Soviet order, is already a defect that can be exploited by the enemies of the working people, and can give Kolchak and Denikin a foothold for victory." Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "People who break the law must also be punished, imprisoned, and even executed." This is because any violation of the law is a serious harm to the country and the people and can give the enemy more opportunities for activity.
    Our state organ workers and Communist Party members are generally diligent, conscientious, law-abiding, and wholeheartedly serving the people. But there are indeed some people who think that they have "status," or think that they have had a little "merit" or "hard work" in the past, so they feel that they should be different from the general public. Therefore, they act as if they are special people and regard the law as only for "ordinary people," having little to do with themselves. They think that the Party and the government should allow them some privileges, and that they should be treated leniently if they break the law. Under the control of this kind of thinking, they intentionally or unintentionally commit some acts that violate state laws to varying degrees. For example, violating the arrest and trial system, violating the Marriage Law, violating the administrative system of state organs, and violating public order, etc. They fail to see that this kind of thinking is precisely a reflection of the shameful feudal princely thinking, a reflection of the bourgeois privileged thinking and style. In feudal society, there was a saying that "rites do not extend to the common people, and punishments do not reach the officials." At that time, the country's criminal law and other laws were prepared for the "common people," that is, the ordinary people. The scholar-official class, that is, the ruling class or the pawns of the ruling class, was not subject to any legal constraints. As for the emperor or monarch, he could arbitrarily "bestow" death or any punishment on people. His will and words were the law, and the law naturally had no constraints on him. Those rulers who enforced the law and broke it were the mortal enemies of the people. If we now also know the law and break it, and demand privileges, it is not to elevate ourselves and increase any glory, but to insult ourselves and destroy the glorious title of Communist Party members and state organ workers.
    Article 18 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "All staff members of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and the laws, and strive to serve the people." This is a solemn and sacred law, and it is also the lofty morality and greatest glory of state organ staff members. Article 85 of the Constitution stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal before the law." This means that in our country, no one can fail to abide by the law. The state must not have any connivance towards anyone who violates the law, no matter how high their position is or how great their past contributions were. Conniving with them is destroying the law and harming the people's democratic cause.
    There are also a small number of Communist Party members who think that the Communist Party is the leader of the country, and Communist Party members can be special. As long as they abide by the Party's discipline, they can be a little careless about abiding by state laws and administrative discipline. This kind of thinking is also completely wrong. An important aspect of the Party's discipline is that Party members must abide by state laws and administrative discipline. Therefore, violating state laws and political discipline is also violating Party discipline and harming the Party's interests. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party": "Every Party member should not only abide by the Party's discipline, but also set an example in abiding by all the legal discipline of revolutionary governments and all other revolutionary organizations—such as the discipline of revolutionary armies, revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary career agencies. Every Party member should play an exemplary role in various revolutionary undertakings. We should unify the observance of Party discipline with the observance of revolutionary governments and all revolutionary organizations, and not oppose the two. The Party wants every one of its members to set an example in abiding by the people's revolutionary discipline and the discipline of revolutionary governments and all revolutionary organizations. And every Party member who does not abide by the discipline of revolutionary governments and all revolutionary organizations is not abiding by Party discipline." Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party clearly stipulates that Communist Party members who are subject to criminal penalties for violating state laws will be expelled from the Party.
    The entire working class and other working people must work hard to educate themselves, so that they can become models of abiding by the people's laws and models of abiding by and implementing all the decrees of the people's government; at the same time, they should also set a good example in abiding by labor discipline. Violations of labor discipline must also be dealt with seriously and should never be ignored. Of course, when conducting education on law abiding, we should first emphasize the importance of abiding by the Constitution and the law. Because this is the most important and most fundamental.
    Everyone abides by the Constitution and the law, and everyone is equal before the law. This is the principle of our country's legal system, and no one may destroy it. The more powerful our Constitution and laws are, the more sound our revolutionary legal system is, the more fully guaranteed the people's rights and interests and the country's socialist construction will be. Therefore, with the implementation of our country's Constitution, we must universally strengthen education on law abiding, overcome all thoughts and behaviors in the people, state organ workers, and Communist Party members that are incompatible with the revolutionary legal system, and create a good atmosphere in which everyone abides by the law. This is necessary to protect the vested interests of the people, and it is also necessary to protect the cause of socialist construction and create greater happiness for the people.

    加强守法教育
    我国人民五年来能够有效地巩固自己的革命胜利成果，并且在政治、经济、文化各方面不断地取得新的胜利，这是同人民的法制建设工作的顺利开展分不开的。现在我们国家的根本法——中华人民共和国宪法已经由第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过，我国的法制建设进入了一个新的阶段；今后随着我国宪法的制定，还要制定许多法律，使我国的法律更加完备、更加充实，以便有效地保障国家的建设和保护人民的权益。
    把我们国家建设成为一个繁荣幸福的伟大的社会主义国家，是我国广大人民的共同愿望，也是我国宪法所规定了的我们国家的奋斗目标。我们的敌人为了不让我们达到这一伟大目标，正在不断地加强他们的反革命破坏活动。社会上的各种犯罪分子，如不法资产阶级分子和流氓盗匪分子，以至国家机关中潜藏着的违法乱纪、贪污腐化的蜕化分子也都在不同程度上危害着我们伟大的社会主义事业。我们要保障社会主义事业不受危害和破坏，必须不断地加强对于反革命分子和其他破坏分子的斗争，革命的法律，就是进行这种斗争的有力武器。
    但是在我们国家里并不是每一个人都已经懂得了人民的法律和革命法制的重要意义。有许多人因为受旧社会传统习惯的影响较深，受剥削阶级思想意识的侵蚀较深，所以还不断地发生一些违犯法律的行为。因此，我们必须普遍加强守法的教育，制裁犯法的行为。
    有的人以为：法律只是对付敌人的，我们是工农劳动人民，犯一点法不要紧，不会治罪。这种思想是完全错误的。这些人没有看到，要使我们的法律在反对敌人破坏活动的斗争中，在反对一切犯罪行为的斗争中发挥最大的威力，人民群众就必须积极地维护自己的法律，自觉地遵守自己的法律，以保证表现人民意志的法律具有神圣不可侵犯的威严，能够在全国统一施行。反革命分子和其他犯罪分子能够进行破坏活动，常常是因为我们有一些可供他们利用的空隙。如果人民群众不注意遵守法律，就会给敌人和不法分子以可乘之机。如果人人守法，就孤立了敌人和犯罪分子，就更便于国家发挥法律的威力，打击敌人和一切犯罪分子。我们必须牢牢记住列宁的话：“稍微违反法律，稍微破坏苏维埃秩序，便已经是可以被劳动者的敌人所利用的缺陷，便可以使高尔察克和邓尼金获得胜利的支点。”毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说：“人民犯了法，也要处罚，也要坐班房，也有死刑”。这就是因为任何违犯法律的行为都是对国家和人民的严重危害，都能给敌人增加活动的机会。
    我们的国家机关工作人员和共产党员，一般都是勤勤恳恳、奉公守法，忠心为人民办事的。但是确实也还有一些人，他们自以为有“地位”，或者以为过去有过一点“功劳”或“苦劳”就觉得自己和一般群众应该有所不同，因而俨然以特殊人物自居，把法律看作只是为“普通人”制定的，同自己没有多大关系，以为党和政府应该允许他们有一点什么特权，犯了法也应该包涵一点，从宽处理。在这种思想支配之下，他们就有意无意或轻或重地发生了一些违反国家法律的行为。比如违反逮捕和审判制度、违反婚姻法、违反国家机关的行政制度和违反公共秩序等等。他们没有看到，这种思想正是可耻的封建王侯思想的反映，是资产阶级特权思想作风的反映。封建社会里有所谓“礼不下庶人，刑不上大夫”的说法，那时候国家的刑法和其他法律，都是给“庶人”即老百姓预备的。士大夫阶层，即统治阶级或统治阶级的爪牙是不受什么法律约束的。至于皇帝或君王，更可以随意“赐”人以死罪或任何刑罚，他的意志和言语就是法律，法律对他当然更没有任何约束力了。那些执法犯法的统治者正是人民群众的死敌。如果我们现在也知法犯法，要求特权，那就不是抬高了自己，增加了什么光荣，而正是侮辱了自己，毁坏了共产党员和国家机关工作人员的光荣称号。
    中华人民共和国宪法第十八条规定：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”这是庄严神圣的法律，也是国家机关工作人员的崇高道德和最大光荣。宪法第八十五条规定：“中华人民共和国公民在法律上一律平等。”这就是说，在我们国家，没有任何人可以不遵守法律。国家对于一切违犯法律的人，不管他有多高的地位，过去有过多大功劳，都不能有任何姑息。对他们的姑息，就是对法律的破坏，就是对人民民主事业的危害。
    也还有一小部分共产党员，以为共产党是国家的领导者，共产党员可以特殊一些，只要遵守党的纪律就可以了，对于遵守国家法律和行政纪律则似乎可以马虎一点。这种思想也是完全错误的。党的纪律中的重要一项，是党员必须遵守国家的法律和行政纪律，所以违犯了国法和政纪也就是违犯了党纪，危害了党的利益。刘少奇同志在“论党”中说：“每一个党员，不只是应该遵守党的纪律，而且应该模范地遵守革命政府的一切法纪和一切其他革命组织——如革命的军队、革命的群众团体和革命的事业机关的纪律。每一个党员在各种革命事业中应起模范作用。应该把遵守党纪与遵守革命政府和一切革命组织的纪律，统一起来，而不可把二者对立起来。党就是要自己的每一个党员模范地遵守人民的革命纪律，遵守革命政府与一切革命组织的纪律。而每一个党员如果不遵守革命政府和一切革命组织的纪律，也就是不遵守党纪。”所以中国共产党明确规定：对于因违犯国法而受到刑事处分的共产党员是要开除党籍的。
    全体工人阶级和其他劳动人民都必须努力教育自己，使自己成为遵守人民法律的模范，成为遵守和执行人民政府的一切法令的模范；同时也应该在遵守劳动纪律等方面做出好的榜样来。对于违反劳动纪律的行为也必须予以严肃的处理，决不应该忽视。当然，在进行守法教育的时候，我们应该首先强调遵守宪法和法律的重要性。因为这是最主要的和最根本的。
    人人遵守宪法和法律，人人在法律上一律平等，这是我们国家的法制原则，任何人不得破坏。我们的宪法和法律越有威力，我们的革命法制越加健全，人民的权利和利益、国家的社会主义建设就越有充分保障。因此，随着我国宪法的实施，我们必须普遍加强守法教育，克服人民群众中和国家机关工作人员、共产党员中一切同革命法制相抵触的思想和行为，造成人人守法的优良风气。这是保护人民的既得利益所必需，也是保护社会主义建设事业和为人民创造更大幸福所必需。
