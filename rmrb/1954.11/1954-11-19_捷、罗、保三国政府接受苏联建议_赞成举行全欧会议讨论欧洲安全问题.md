Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 17th: Czechoslovak Premier Viliam Široký delivered a radio address on the 16th, declaring that the Czechoslovak government accepts the Soviet government's proposal.

Široký pointed out that those who uphold the "position of strength" policy and the West German rearmament course are unwilling to consider the lessons of history and the reality after the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community." They are using all their strength and all means to formulate a new plan to replace the "European Defense Community" in the near future. The Paris Agreements have sharpened the situation in Europe and the world again, and it directly threatens the security of the people of European countries. Once the Paris Agreements are realized, the most ferocious enemies of the people of European countries and the German people will once again hold the power of attack.

Široký said that the Czechoslovak people are concerned about their own security and the peace of Europe, and also about the fate of the people of Western European countries, especially the French people. The Czechoslovak people have all the necessary conditions to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland. Czechoslovakia has the powerful Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the People's Republic of China as its allies.

Široký said: The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic solemnly declares that when it comes to the implementation of the West German rearmament agreements, it will reach a consensus with all its allies and friends and take necessary measures together with them to guarantee and consolidate its security. The duty of the people of European countries is to do everything possible to make Europe develop along the road of easing tensions, and the situation of the people of European countries killing each other must never be allowed to appear.

Široký said: The Czechoslovak government has fully supported the Soviet government's proposal on concluding a "Pan-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" from the beginning. The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, representing the will of the Czechoslovak people, wholeheartedly supports and endorses the Soviet proposal to convene a conference including all European countries and the United States willing to participate in Moscow or Paris on November 29 to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The entire Czechoslovak people warmly support the new Soviet proposal, believing that it is a realistic way out of the current complex situation, and a practical road to further easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Europe and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 17th: The Romanian News Agency broadcast the Romanian People's Republic government's response to the Soviet government's note of November 13, agreeing to hold a pan-European conference in Moscow or Paris on November 29 to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.

The response stated that once the London and Paris agreements come into effect, it will inevitably make relations between European countries more strained, accelerate the arms race, and intensify the threat of a new war.

The response said: For forty years, Romania has twice suffered the destructive consequences of establishing aggressive blocs in Europe, and has suffered the disaster of German militarist aggression policy. Therefore, the Government of the Romanian People's Republic considers the issue of maintaining peace and guaranteeing European collective security to be a matter of life and death for the Romanian people and the people of other European countries.

The response pointed out that the Romanian People's Republic government fully agrees that measures should be taken to establish a European collective security system. The Government of the Romanian People's Republic declares that it is prepared to participate in the conference proposed by the Soviet government in its note, including all European countries and the United States willing to participate, to solve the problem of establishing a European collective security system, and believes that it is appropriate for the People's Republic of China to send observers to participate in this conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 18th: Bulgarian newspapers published on the 17th the Bulgarian government's reply to the Soviet government's note of November 13 regarding convening a conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.

The Bulgarian reply stated that the decisions of the London and Paris conferences are a serious threat to European peace. Implementing these decisions makes it impossible to unite Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and the state of opposition between some European countries and other European countries will deepen international tensions and increase the danger of a new European war.

The London and Paris agreements have caused serious unease among the Bulgarian people, who are deeply convinced that the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany and the establishment of a European collective security system are the main conditions for maintaining and consolidating European peace and world peace.

The note declares that the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the Bulgarian people, firmly opposes the London and Paris agreements. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has decided to accept the Soviet government's proposal to hold a conference including all European countries and the United States willing to participate in Moscow or Paris on November 29, 1954, to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria announces that it is ready to participate in this conference.

    捷、罗、保三国政府接受苏联建议
    赞成举行全欧会议讨论欧洲安全问题
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十七日讯：捷克斯洛伐克总理威廉·西罗基十六日发表广播演说，声明捷克斯洛伐克政府接受苏联政府的建议。
    西罗基指出：拥护“实力地位”政策和西德重新军国主义化方针的人不愿意考虑历史的教训和“欧洲防务集团”破产以后的现实。他们用尽一切力量和一切手段，要在最近期内制定一个新的计划来代替“欧洲防务集团”。巴黎协定使欧洲和世界的局势再度尖锐化，它直接威胁欧洲各国人民的安全。一旦巴黎协定得以实现，欧洲各国人民和德国人民的最凶恶的敌人就将又握有攻击的力量。
    西罗基说：捷克斯洛伐克人民关心自身的安全和欧洲的和平，也关心西欧各国人民，特别是法国人民的命运。捷克斯洛伐克人民具有一切必要的条件来保卫自己祖国的独立和自由。捷克斯洛伐克有强大的苏联、各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国作为自己的同盟者。
    西罗基说：捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府郑重声明：当事情涉及到实现西德重新军国主义化协定时，它将同一切盟国和朋友取得一致意见，同它们共同采取必要的措施来保证和巩固自己的安全。欧洲各国人民的职责是尽一切力量使欧洲按着缓和紧张局势的道路发展，决不能让欧洲各国人民互相残杀的局面出现。
    西罗基说：捷克斯洛伐克政府从一开始就完全支持苏联政府的关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表捷克斯洛伐克人民的意志，衷心拥护并支持苏联建议的在十一月二十九日在莫斯科或者巴黎召开一个包括所有愿意参加的欧洲国家及美国的会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。捷克斯洛伐克全体人民热烈拥护苏联的新建议，认为它是一条走出目前复杂局势的现实出路，是一条进一步缓和国际紧张局势、巩固欧洲及世界和平的实际道路。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特十七日讯：罗马尼亚通讯社广播了罗马尼亚人民共和国政府对苏联政府十一月十三日照会的复照，同意十一月二十九日在莫斯科或巴黎举行全欧会议，来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。
    复照表示：伦敦和巴黎协定一旦生效，就会不可避免地使欧洲国家之间的关系更加紧张，使扩军运动加速进行，并且使新战争的威胁加剧。
    复照说：四十年来，罗马尼亚两度承受了在欧洲建立侵略集团的破坏性后果，遭到了德国军国主义侵略政策的灾祸。因此，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府认为维护和平和保障欧洲集体安全的问题是罗马尼亚人民及欧洲其他各国人民生死攸关的问题。
    复照指出：罗马尼亚人民共和国政府完全同意：应当采取措施以建立欧洲集体安全体系。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府声明：它准备参加苏联政府在照会中建议立即召开的、包括所有愿意参加的欧洲国家和美国的、解决建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的会议，并认为中华人民共和国派遣观察员参加这个会议是适宜的。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚报纸在十七日刊载了保加利亚政府对苏联政府十一月十三日关于召开讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的照会致苏联政府的复照。
    保加利亚的复照说：伦敦和巴黎会议的决定是对欧洲和平的严重威胁。实行了这些决定，就不可能在和平和民主的基础上统一德国，而某一些欧洲国家同另一些欧洲国家对立的状态就会使国际紧张局势加深，并且会使欧洲新战争的危险加深。
    伦敦和巴黎协定引起了保加利亚人民的严重不安，保加利亚人民深深相信：建立统一、民主、和平的德国以及建立欧洲集体安全体系，是维护和巩固欧洲和平以及全世界和平的主要条件。
    照会声明：保加利亚人民共和国政府从保加利亚人民的根本利益出发，坚决反对伦敦协定和巴黎协定。保加利亚人民共和国政府决定接受苏联政府的建议：一九五四年十一月二十九日在莫斯科或巴黎举行一个包括一切愿意参加的欧洲国家以及美国的会议，讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题。保加利亚人民共和国政府宣布：它准备参加这个会议。
