    The Relationship Between Agricultural Machinery Tractor Stations and Farmers
    Some readers have inquired: What do agricultural machinery tractor stations do? What are the benefits of using tractors to cultivate land?
    Agricultural machinery tractor stations are socialist enterprises and bases for the state to conduct socialist transformation of agriculture and assist farmers in developing production.
    From 1952 to 1953, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, China experimentally established eleven agricultural machinery tractor stations. With the development of China's industrial construction, more agricultural machinery tractor stations will be established. Through these stations, agriculture can be equipped with mechanized technology, which can ensure the rapid growth of agricultural production levels, promote farmers to learn scientific production technologies, and advance agricultural production along the path of collectivization.
    At present, the basic tasks of China's pilot agricultural machinery tractor stations are as follows: (1) To ensure that the harvest of crops of the agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms they serve continuously increases, and the income of cooperative members and farm members continuously increases. To help farmers create models of agricultural collectivization and scientification from an organizational and technical perspective, to promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives, and to expand socialist education for farmers. (2) To practice strict economy, fully utilize the effectiveness of agricultural machinery and tools, continuously reduce production costs, accumulate experience, and train cadres in order to prepare for the large-scale development of agricultural machinery tractor stations in the future.
    Agricultural machinery tractor stations use agricultural machinery supplied by the state and apply advanced science and technology to carry out mechanical operations for agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in accordance with the provisions of the "production contract." The "production contract" between the agricultural machinery tractor station and the agricultural production cooperative or collective farm is the key to embodying the worker-peasant alliance, promoting the production enthusiasm of agricultural machinery tractor station workers, production cooperative members, and farm members, and ensuring increased crop yields. Therefore, the contract must be discussed and approved by all members of the agricultural production cooperative, all members of the collective farm, and the staff of the agricultural machinery tractor station, and signed with a certain ceremony under the leadership of the local Party and government in accordance with the principle of mutual voluntariness, and reported to the county people's government for the record, so that it can be strictly enforced under the supervision of the government. The production contract generally stipulates: the obligations of the agricultural machinery tractor station; the obligations of the agricultural production cooperative and the collective farm; the method of acceptance of the agricultural machinery tractor station's agricultural work and remuneration, and the responsibilities that both parties should bear in case of breach of contract, etc.
    In the areas where the eleven pilot agricultural machinery tractor stations are located, crop yields and members' incomes have increased. Generally speaking, the land cultivated by tractor stations has increased the average yield per mu by 30 percent. The Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, harvested 860 jin of rice per mu, which was 130 percent higher than the harvest of local farmers. The Hongxing Collective Farm in Beijing produced 160 jin of seed cotton per mu, which was 60 percent higher than local farmers. Each member of the Xinghuo Collective Farm earned 60,000 yuan per labor day, and an average member earned 12 to 13 million yuan a year, with some earning as much as 20 to 30 million yuan. The farm sold 75 percent of its total harvest to the state as commodity grain. The achievements have profoundly educated farmers on the benefits of collectivized mechanized farming and promoted and consolidated the development of the local mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, before the spring plowing in 1953, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm served by the Changzhi Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Shanxi Province had 918 collective households, and many households still had concerns and wanted to withdraw. However, after the autumn harvest, 114 households joined the farm; the Beijing Hongxing Collective Farm also expanded from 63 households to 560 households.
    According to preliminary statistics, there were 76 newly built agricultural machinery tractor stations in 1954. These tractor stations will fully play their due role in the road of agricultural cooperativization and become a powerful lever for promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    农业机器拖拉机站和农民的关系
    有些读者询问：农业机器拖拉机站是干什么的？用拖拉机耕地有什么好处？
    农业机器拖拉机站是社会主义性质的企业，是国家对农业进行社会主义改造和帮助农民发展生产的基地。
    从一九五二年到一九五三年在党和人民政府的领导下，我国试办了十一个农业机器拖拉机站，随着我国工业建设的发展，农业机器拖拉机站将会更多的设立起来，通过它给农业以机械化的技术装备，可以保证农业生产水平的迅速增长，促进农民学习科学的生产技术，使农业生产沿着集体化的道路前进。
    目前，我国试办的农业机器拖拉机站的基本任务有以下两个方面：（一）保证它所服务的农业生产合作社和集体农庄农作物的收获量不断提高，社员和庄员的收入不断增加，从组织上和技术上帮助农民创造农业集体化、科学化的典范，促进农业生产合作社的巩固发展，扩大对农民的社会主义教育。（二）厉行节约，充分发挥机器农具的效能，不断降低生产费用，积累经验，培养干部，为今后农业机器拖拉机站的大量发展做好准备工作。
    农业机器拖拉机站使用国家供给的农业机械，运用先进的科学技术，按照“生产合同”的规定为农业生产合作社和集体农庄进行机械作业。农业机器拖拉机站和农业生产合作社、集体农庄的“生产合同”是体现工农联盟，推动农业机器拖拉机站职工和生产合作社社员、农庄庄员的生产积极性，保证提高农作物产量的关键。因此合同的订定必须由农业生产合作社全体社员、集体农庄全体庄员和农业机器拖拉机站职工大会讨论通过，在当地党和政府领导下举行一定仪式，按照双方自愿原则签订，并报送县人民政府备案，以便在政府监督下，严格遵照执行。生产合同中一般规定：农业机器拖拉机站的义务；农业生产合作社、集体农庄的义务；验收农业机器拖拉机站农事工作的方法和工作报酬，以及违反合同时双方应负的责任等。
    在试办的十一个农业机器拖拉机站的地方，农作物产量和社员收入都有增加，一般说拖拉机站机耕的土地，每亩平均增产百分之三十。黑龙江省桦川县星火集体农庄水稻每亩收八百六十斤，高出当地农民收获量的百分之一百三十。北京市红星集体农庄，每亩产籽棉一百六十斤，高出当地农民百分之六十。星火集体农庄每一庄员每个劳动日的收入达六万元，一个普通庄员一年收入达一千二、三百万元，收入多的达两三千万元。全农庄出售给国家的商品粮占总收获量的百分之七十五。这些成果的获得，深刻地教育农民认识到集体化机械耕作的好处，促进和巩固了当地互助合作运动的发展。如山西省长治农业机器拖拉机站所服务的中苏友好集体农庄一九五三年春耕前有集体农户九百一十八户，有很多户还有顾虑，想退出。但在秋收后，有一百一十四户参加了农庄；北京红星集体农庄也由六十三户扩大为五百六十户。
    一九五四年新建的农业机器拖拉机站，据初步统计已有七十六处。这些拖拉机站在农业合作化的道路上将充分发挥它们应有的作用，成为推进农业社会主义改造的强有力的杠杆。
