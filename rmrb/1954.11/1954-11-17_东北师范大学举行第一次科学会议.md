    Northeast Normal University Holds First Science Conference
    Northeast Normal University held its first science conference from the 4th to the 7th. Attending the conference were teachers, graduate students, and some senior students from Northeast Normal University, as well as teacher representatives from normal colleges and universities in the Northeast region, universities in Changchun, and relevant personnel from scientific research institutions and business departments, totaling more than 1,900 people.
    The conference heard thirty special research papers and experimental and investigation reports. These special studies and reports were selected from the scientific research papers and reports of teachers at Northeast Normal University over the past year or so. At the meeting, attendees engaged in free discussion and serious debate. For example, regarding the report on "The Basic Characteristics of Literary Language," the Chinese Language and Literature Group debated issues such as the concept of literary language. A professor from the Physics Department of Northeast People's University also raised many supplements and questions to a report studying Lenin's theory of matter's guiding significance for modern physics. The conference decided to continue organizing discussions on important issues where debates had not yet concluded.
    Northeast Normal University has determined that combining teaching, combining the reality of middle schools, and combining national construction should be the direction for teachers to conduct scientific research. From the spring of 1953 to September of this year, 98 teachers at Northeast Normal University have completed 92 scientific research topics, and 164 various scientific research projects have now been determined. These scientific research works have played a role in improving teaching quality. The Chinese Language and Literature Department and the History Department have both revised some teaching materials based on the results of scientific research. Research results reported at this conference, such as the "Experiment on Preparing Methane from Sodium Acetate," have also been applied in teaching experiments, changing the past situation of poor experimental results, high costs, and insecurity. Research results such as the "Preliminary Report on Spinach Irrigation Experiment" and "Arthropods in the Coastal Area of Dalian" have also played a certain role in biology teaching and research.

    东北师范大学举行第一次科学会议
    东北师范大学四日到七日举行第一次科学会议。出席这次会议的有东北师范大学的教师、研究生和部分高年级学生，还有东北区各高等师范院校、长春各高等学校的教师代表，以及科学研究机关和业务部门的有关人员共一千九百多人。
    会议听取了三十篇专题研究论文和实验、调查报告。这些专题研究和报告是从东北师范大学教师近一年多来的科学研究论文和报告中选择出来的一部分。会上，到会人员展开了自由的讨论和认真的争辩。如对“文学语言的基本特征”的报告，中国语言文组便辩论了文学语言的概念等问题，东北人民大学物理系教授对一篇研究列宁关于物质的理论对近代物理学的指导意义的报告，也提出了很多补充和质问。会议决定对辩论尚未终结的重要问题继续组织讨论。
    东北师范大学已确定以结合教学、结合中学实际、结合国家建设为教师进行科学研究的方向。从一九五三年春季到今年九月，东北师范大学已有九十八名教师完成了九十二个科学研究题目，目前又确定了一百六十四项各种科学专题的研究计划。这些科学研究工作对提高教学质量已发挥了作用。中国语言文学系和历史系都根据科学研究的结果对部分教材进行修改，这次会上报告的“由醋酸钠制取钾烷的实验”等研究成果，也都在教学实验中应用，并改变了过去实验结果不好、成本高、不安全的情况。“菠菜灌溉试验的初步报告”、“大连沿海的节肢动物”等项研究成果，对生物学的教学和研究工作也都起了一定的作用。　（新华社）
