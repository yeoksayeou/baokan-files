It's Better to Obey the National Plan
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

At first, the He Huaixin family had a lot of opinions about the unified sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton. He Huaixin's sister-in-law said, "How can one zhang one chi of fine cloth be enough to wear? It's more than enough for one garment, but not enough for two!" He Huaixin's father didn't care about how much cloth he wore, but he felt that if the government didn't allow them to buy more grain, it wouldn't be useful to sell more cotton.

Because of this, He Huaixin held several family meetings, calculated carefully, and compared the facts before and after the unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton cloth. As a result, they themselves discarded these ideas.

            ×  ×  ×

Since He Huaixin's father didn't want to sell more cotton to the state because he couldn't buy more grain, let's start by discussing whether the state's implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain is ultimately beneficial or harmful to the He Huaixin family.

The He Huaixin family's most unforgettable experience was eating corn noodles on the first day of the Lunar New Year in 1948. At that time, although the He Huaixin family was a middle-peasant household, their grain yield was low, and cotton only yielded about 100 jin per mu. Every year, they had to use the money from selling cotton to buy back a large amount of food. At that time, the Kuomintang's currency was worthless, and private merchants engaged in speculation, causing grain prices to rise sharply. That year, the family planted 17 mu of land, 10 mu of which were cotton. When the cotton was first harvested, 100 jin of seed cotton could be exchanged for 250 jin of millet. After a few days, it could only be exchanged for 150 jin of millet. After a few more days, He Huaixin's brother carried 100 jin of lint cotton to the city and only sold it for the price of 100 jin of seed cotton, forcing the whole family to eat corn noodles on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Later, when they didn't have enough grain, they had to reluctantly sell their big black donkey. At that time, they calculated that this big black donkey could be exchanged for four shi and five dou of grain, but three days later, when the buyer paid the money, the price of grain had risen by half again.

The cotton farmers' miserable experiences before liberation are endless.

The situation changed after liberation. Thanks to state support and organized production (in the five years since liberation, the state has supplied and lent the mutual aid team that He Huaixin participated in with industrial products such as sprayers, walking plows, waterwheels, fertilizers, and medicines worth a total of 4.6 million yuan), the yield of wheat per mu increased from 170 jin in 1949 to 300 jin in 1952, and the yield of cotton per mu also increased from 130 jin in 1949 to 240 jin in 1952. Last year, He Huaixin's family joined the agricultural production cooperative, and the land yield and actual income increased again. At the same time, prices have stabilized, and the state has stipulated reasonable grain-cotton price ratios. He Huaixin's family plants 10 mu of cotton. Before liberation, each mu yielded 100 jin of seed cotton, and each 100 jin of seed cotton could generally be exchanged for 200 jin of millet. After liberation, 100 jin of seed cotton could be exchanged for 300 jin of millet. In the five years since liberation, 10 mu of cotton have produced approximately 10,000 jin of seed cotton, which is about 10,000 jin more millet than before liberation. In addition, the production of wheat and millet has also increased year after year, and the prices of industrial products have also decreased year after year, which has gradually made the He Huaixin family's life more prosperous.

The He Huaixin family has ten people, nine of whom eat at home regularly (including two children). In the past, the family finances were not transparent. They had a muddled account every year, the brothers and sisters-in-law were wary of each other and had differing opinions. The women didn't know how to save when cooking, and there were always leftovers for one or two people at each meal, which was a great waste. In addition, daughters and daughters-in-law would visit their parents' homes and send gifts back and forth, half openly and half secretly, whoever got the chance would grab it. Therefore, the family's monthly grain consumption was always above 300 jin. After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, the grain supply was rationed. At the same time, the income distribution of the production cooperative was also regular and quantitative, which made the family's finances transparent. Therefore, based on the family's actual income and the state's quantitative grain supply, they democratically arranged the year's consumption and expenditures. This allowed them to plan how much to eat and use each month, and to study how to save when cooking. Now, the family's monthly grain consumption has been reduced to 270 jin, and their living standards are still higher than in the past, and the family has become more harmonious. Therefore, they said, "Unified purchase and sale has unified our family well."

The whole family realized these benefits through discussion. They began to feel closer to the grain unified purchase and sale policy, felt that it was needed by themselves, and found a proper outlet for the money from selling cotton: in addition to the cooperative's unified investment in production, they deposited the unprecedented net surplus of 4.7 million yuan into the credit cooperative.

The sisters-in-law are always worried that they don't have enough clothes to wear. It's best to compare it with the past and show off their current belongings.

In the years before liberation, the whole family only had a few old quilts. After liberation, in 1949, they sold cotton, bought a donkey, bought 2,000 jin of food, added some farm tools, and bought some coal. That year, each adult in the family was given five jin of cotton to weave some coarse cloth, which meant that everyone had a quilt and a few clothes. In 1950 and 1951, they added some large farm tools, and each person was given four jin of cotton, which was all spun. Their bedding and clothes became more substantial. The father made a large cotton robe, and the brothers each made a cotton coat. However, at this time, they still hadn't worn fine cloth. By 1952, they had joined the mutual aid team, production had increased by 20%, they had bought new-style walking plows, carts, and sprayers, borrowed a waterwheel, and also used pens, flashlights, and teacups. Each person had one or two sets of bedding, and each person also had three to five sets of clothes. That year, they also started buying fine cloth. The brothers made suits of fine cloth, and the children were also dressed up in colorful fine cloth. In addition, the men bought rubber-soled shoes, and the women bought towels and fine silk stockings, reducing the amount of homespun cloth used. Therefore, that year, each person was given four jin of cotton, but only two jin were spun, and the woven homespun cloth wasn't even used up. By 1953, they had joined the agricultural production cooperative, and they couldn't finish the distributed grain. They no longer had to use the money from selling cotton to buy food, and their purchasing power increased even more. Not to mention other daily necessities, but in terms of clothing alone, each adult in the family bought a set of woolen underwear, a pair of rubber-soled shoes, and eight chi of fine cloth. The children were dressed up even more beautifully. At this time, each person in the family had two sets of quilts, half coarse cloth and half fine cloth, two to three cotton-padded coats, and five to seven single-layer and lined clothes. Therefore, last year, each person was given three jin of cotton, but they all had a large package left over that hadn't been spun. He Huaixin's sister-in-law spun two jin and wove it into homespun cloth, but it had been kept at the bottom of the chest.

The purchasing power of this family is almost the highest in the whole village, but after such a comparison and calculation, the whole family bought less than ten zhang of fine cloth last year. Each person was given three jin of cotton, but they didn't use it all up. Then, according to the state's supply standards for cotton-producing area farmers in Henan Province, each person gets one zhang and one chi of fine cloth per year, plus eight chi of homespun cloth. For a family of ten, that's eleven zhang of fine cloth, plus eight chi of homespun cloth, which is equivalent to one jin and four liang of cotton. Adding the one jin of reserved cotton stipulated, each person has two jin and four liang of cotton. In this way, the standard of living is obviously only higher than last year, not lower. He Huaixin's sister-in-law said it well: "In our cotton-producing area, there is a saying about clothing: 'New for three years, old for three years, mended and patched for another three years.' Even if we are told to buy as much as possible this year, we won't exceed the supply standard." (Note: Recently, after adjustments, Henan Province cotton-producing areas have been given an additional four chi of fine cloth per person per year, so each person now has a total of one zhang and five chi of fine cloth per year.)

After calculating the accounts and showing off their belongings, the whole family understood the situation and knew what was going on. However, the elderly, especially the women, still have a "wide margin for use" idea. They always want to store a few more jin of cotton and keep a few more sets of clothes by their side. The reason is: who can say that people won't have any misfortunes? For example, if they get sick at some point, they can't spin or sew. It doesn't matter if adults wear good or bad clothes, but children always need to have a few new sets of clothes.

At the family meeting, He Huaixin analyzed and criticized this kind of thinking in his speech. He said: "We have to look further ahead. This kind of thinking of yours is simply because you are afraid that your life won't be guaranteed. But how can we really have a guarantee? I think only by running the agricultural production cooperative well and supporting the development of national industry can our personal lives be truly guaranteed. Let's take our family as an example. Why weren't our finances prosperous in the first few years after liberation, and why did the state rarely supply us with cloth? Why has our life become prosperous in recent years, and why is the state able to supply us with all kinds of cloth and agricultural implements? This is because our cooperative is well-run, production has developed, and we have supported national industrial construction, so we can go from wearing homespun cloth to wearing woolen underwear and fine cloth, and our lives are guaranteed. If the majority of farmers who grow cotton sell their cotton to the state according to the state's purchase plan, and don't allow private merchants to speculate, so that the state can weave more and cheaper fine cloth, then our cooperative can buy sewing machines for the members to sew clothes in the future, so what do you have to worry about? Conversely, if every farmer who grows cotton thinks about storing a few more jin of cotton, it will affect the development of national industry, and we won't be able to wear good cloth. So, our farmers' 'wide margin for use' will cause us to lose big because of small gains, which is detrimental to the country and will make our lives even less secure."

This speech brightened the hearts of the whole family. The whole family agreed, and He Huaixin's brother said this: "The state has arranged our food and clothing for us. All in all, it's better to obey the national plan."

    还是服从国家计划好
    本报记者  吕建中
    贺怀信一家人开头对棉布统销和棉花统购很有意见。贺怀信的嫂嫂说：“一人一丈一尺细布咋穿法？一件衣裳有余，两件衣裳不够！”贺怀信的父亲对穿多少布倒不在意；但他觉得要是政府不叫多买点粮食，棉花卖的再多也没有用处。
    为了这，贺怀信开了几次家庭会，算细账，拿粮食、棉布等统购统销前后的事实做对比，结果，还是由他们自己把自己的这些想法丢掉了。
            ×  ×  ×
    既然贺怀信的父亲因为不能多买点粮食就不想把更多的棉花卖给国家，那么就从国家实行粮食统购统销对贺怀信一家究竟有利还是有害说起吧。
    贺怀信全家人最难忘的是一九四八年吃着玉米面条过大年初一的那件事。那时候，贺怀信家虽是中农户，但，粮食产量低，棉花每亩也只收百来斤，每年总得用卖棉的钱买回大宗食粮。当时国民党的票子不值钱，私商投机倒把，粮价见风长，那年全家十七亩地种了十亩棉花，刚收棉时一百斤籽棉还能换二百五十斤小米，过了没几天就只能换一百五十斤小米了，又过了几天，贺怀信哥哥担了一百斤皮棉到城里只卖上了一百斤籽棉的价，弄得全家吃着玉米面条过了大年初一。后来粮食不够吃，只好忍痛把那头大黑驴卖掉，当时计算着这头大黑驴能换回四石五斗粮食，等到三天后买主付了钱，粮价却又涨了一半。
    解放以前棉农的悲惨遭遇是说不完的。
    解放后情况就变了，由于国家扶持，组织起来生产（解放五年来国家供应和贷给贺怀信参加的互助组喷雾器、步犁、水车、肥料、药械、药剂等工业品共价值四百六十万元），小麦每亩产量由一九四九年一百七十斤递增到一九五二年的三百斤，棉花每亩产量也由一九四九年的一百三十斤递增到一九五二年的二百四十斤；去年贺怀信家参加了农业生产合作社，土地产量和实际收入又有增加。同时，物价稳定了，国家又规定了合理的粮棉比价，贺怀信家种十亩棉花，解放前每亩收一百斤籽棉，每百斤籽棉一般换二百斤小米，解放后一百斤籽棉换三百斤小米，解放五年来十亩棉花大约共产一万斤籽棉，比解放前就多换小米一万斤左右，加上小麦、谷子等也连年增产，工业品价格又逐年下降，这就使贺怀信全家的生活逐渐走向富裕。
    贺怀信全家十口人，长期在家吃饭的九口人
  （内有两个小孩）。过去，家庭经济不公开，一年一笔糊涂账，弟兄、妯娌们互相戒备，互有意见，妇女做饭也不知道节省，每顿饭总是剩下一个至两个人的饭，浪费很大，加上姑娘、媳妇走娘家还来送往，明一半，暗一半，谁得手谁捞一把。因此，全家每月消费的粮食总在三百斤以上。国家实行粮食统购统销以后，粮食供应有了定量，同时生产合作社的收益分配也是定期定量，这就使全家的经济公开了，于是根据一家的实际收入和国家对粮食的定量供应，民主地安排了全年的消费和开支，由此也就计划出每月吃多少，用多少，研究出做饭怎样能够节省。现在全家每月吃粮食减低到二百七十斤，生活水平还比过去高些，家庭也变得和睦起来。因此他们说：“统购统销把咱的家庭统好了。”
    全家人从讨论中认识了这些好处，他们开始对粮食统购统销政策感到亲切，感到为自己所需要了，对卖棉花的钱也找到了正当的出路：除社里统一向生产投资外，他们把今年全家破天荒第一次净余下来的四百七十万元存到信用合作组里去。
                  ×  ×  ×
    妯娌们总是担心衣服不够穿，这最好还是和过去比一比，把现在的家当摆一摆。
    解放前的那些年月里，全家人只有几条旧被子。解放后，一九四九年卖了棉花，买回了一头驴，买了两千斤口粮，再添点农具，买点煤，那年全家每个大人分给五斤棉花，织点粗布，算是每人有了一条被子和几件衣服。一九五○年和一九五一年，再添点大农具，每人分给四斤棉花，也全纺了，穿的盖的又壮实了，父亲做件大棉袍，弟兄们一人一身棉大衣；不过这时候还没有穿上细布。到一九五二年，参加了互助组，生产增加了二成，买了新式步犁、大车、喷雾器，贷了一部水车，也用上了钢笔、手电筒和茶缸，铺的盖的每人总有一两套，穿的每人也有三五身，这年并且开始买细布了，兄弟们做一身细布衣，孩子们也用花色细布打扮起来了，另外男人买了胶底鞋，妇女买了毛巾和细线袜，减少了土布用量，因此这年每人分四斤棉花只纺了二斤，织的粗布也没用完。到一九五三年，参加了农业生产合作社，分的粮食吃不完，再不用拿卖棉花的钱去买食粮了，购买力更加提高，别的日用品不说，光穿的方面，全家每个大人买了一套绒衣，一双胶底鞋，八尺细布，孩子们打扮得更漂亮。这时候，全家每人都有粗细布各半的被子两套，棉衣两身到三身，单衣和夹衣五身到七身，因此去年每人分了三斤棉花都剩下一大包没有纺，贺怀信的嫂嫂纺了二斤，织成粗布，也一直压在箱底下。
    他们这户人家购买力在全村来说，差不多算是最高的了，可是这样一对比，一计算，去年全家买了不到十丈细布；每个人分了三斤棉花也没有用完，那么今年按照国家对河南省产棉区农民的供应标准，每人每年一丈一尺细布，另外还有八尺土布，全家十口人就是十一丈细布，另外八尺土布折成一斤四两棉花，加上规定自留的一斤，每人就有二斤四两棉花了，这样，生活水平显然比去年只高不低。贺怀信的嫂嫂说得好：“咱棉区在穿衣上有句俗话：‘新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补又三年。’今年就是叫咱尽量买，咱也超不过供应标准。”（按：最近经过调整，河南省产棉区每人每年又给增加了四尺细布，这样每人每年共合细布一丈五尺。）
    经过算账，摆家当，全家人都蹬了底，心中有数了。可是老年人，尤其是妇女还有个“宽打窄用”的想法，他们总想在身边多存几斤棉花，多放几套衣服，理由是：人，谁敢说没个七灾八难，比方不定啥时候病了，纺不能纺，做不能做，大人穿好穿坏不说，孩子总得有几身新衣服。
    家庭会议上，贺怀信在发言中分析批判了这种思想，他说：“咱们眼光要看得远些，您们这种想法无非是怕自己的生活没保障，可是究竟怎样才能有保障呢？我想只有把农业生产合作社办好了，支援国家工业发展了，咱个人的生活才会真正有保障。就按咱家来说吧，为啥刚解放那几年，咱的经济不富裕，国家也很少有布匹供应咱呢？为啥这几年咱的生活富裕了，而国家也就能供应咱各种各样的布匹和农具呢？这就是因为咱的合作社办好了，生产发展了，支援了国家工业建设，咱才能由穿土布到穿绒衣，穿细布，生活才有了保障。要是广大农民都按照国家收购计划把棉花卖给国家，不叫私商投机，让国家织出更多更便宜的细布，咱合作社将来还可以买缝衣机给社员缝衣服，那您们还用顾虑啥？反过来，要是种棉的农民每人都想着多存几斤棉花，那就影响了国家工业发展，咱们也就穿不上好布了。这么说，咱农民‘宽打窄用’就会因小失大，对国家不利，反使咱的生活更没保障。”
    这一番话把全家人的心说亮堂了，全家人都同意，贺怀信的哥哥说的这样一句话：“国家把吃的穿的都给咱安排好了，说到归总，还是服从国家计划好。”
