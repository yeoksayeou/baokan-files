Experiences in Learning Michurin's Theory and Soviet Microbiology
Qiu Weifan, Researcher, Institute of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

For the past four years, in the process of learning from advanced Soviet science, I have taken some detours and also gained some experience. Now I would like to talk about some of my experiences in learning.

The Basic Conditions for Learning Advanced Soviet Science

Based on my learning experience over the past four years, the first thing to learn from the Soviet Union is to have a correct attitude towards learning.

In the past, I was educated in capitalism for a long time. Metaphysical ways of thinking and the viewpoints of Mendel-Morganism had stubbornly taken root. Therefore, to make a 180-degree turn from an opposite position, viewpoint, and method is not a simple correction, but a painful transformation.

After liberation, I felt that the Party and the People's Government were right in everything and that everything was good, but the slogan of opposing Mendel-Morganism was somewhat inappropriate. Since my thinking was like this, I regarded Soviet biology as "novel and unorthodox." The main reason why I started reading papers on Soviet biological science was to get a feel for what made Soviet biological science so "different." I spent a lot of time reading the reports and summaries (in English) of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences August 1948 session. After reading it, my thinking was still on the old side. I remember that at the first meeting in Beijing to discuss Michurin's biological science, I was the first to stand up and express my doubts. This shows that if you are not prepared to abandon the old, you cannot accept the new. Later, the slogan of learning Michurin's biological science had a great impact in the scientific community. I felt that I couldn't "get along" if I didn't understand Michurin's theory, so I verbally negated the "chromosome and gene" argument and recited a set of terms from Michurin's biological science. Looking back on this kind of learning now, I think it was a "wearing a coat" approach, hoping to use a new coat to cover up the old content. Obviously, this kind of learning attitude cannot save me from the abyss of metaphysics.

After studying at the North China People's Revolutionary University and the ideological reform movement, I initially corrected my attitude towards learning. But is it possible to learn smoothly after just doing this? According to my experience, no, there are two other indispensable factors to learn from Soviet experience well.

One is regular political theory study. Advanced Soviet science is based on dialectical materialism. Michurin's biological science is the implementation and practice of dialectical materialism in biological science. Without understanding the basic principles of dialectical materialism, it is impossible to learn and understand Michurin's biological science. For example, in the early stages of learning, I couldn't understand why the "gene" theory was said to be metaphysical, and why the "cyclic occurrence theory" was an anti-evolutionary viewpoint. But since I seriously studied dialectical materialism, I realized that if we allow the existence of such unchanging "genes" that are not affected by the external environment, then biological evolution becomes unimaginable. Although the proponents of the cyclic occurrence theory admit that microorganisms have variations, these variations are limited to a cycle of repetition, and they believe that all variations are just a stage in life, and that after passing through these stages, they will ultimately return to their original state. On the surface, they seem to admit variation, but in essence, they are denying variation and denying evolution. In the process of learning and criticizing these viewpoints, the study of dialectical materialism, in terms of the comprehensiveness of analyzing problems, the internal connections of things, and the development of things, has given me great help.

Through the study of Michurin's biological science, the study of political theory has also been consolidated. In the past, I always thought that Marxism-Leninism was only "universally applicable" to social sciences. Through these years of study, I have essentially realized that universal truth is not divided into social sciences and natural sciences. Not only does revolution need the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, but scientific work also needs the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Without this guidance, not only is it impossible to learn, but it is also impossible to learn well, let alone "apply what you have learned."

The other is mastering the Russian language. Learning from the Soviet Union without understanding Russian is passive learning. The limited translated literature cannot meet the needs of scientific research workers. I felt too painful to face such a sea of new knowledge as an "illiterate," so I insisted on learning Russian since 1950. The improvement of my Russian proficiency not only increased with time, but also increased with the improvement of my ideological understanding. Because I was determined and confident in learning from the Soviet Union, the progress was the fastest compared to learning any foreign language in the past. Since I gradually became able to read and translate independently, I have mastered the key to the Soviet treasure house of knowledge.

The Implementation of Michurin's Theory and Creative Darwinism
in Microbiology

"Applying what you have learned" is the first question we must raise when learning any theory or experience. In the process of learning Michurin's theory, I had some questions: Since Michurin's main research object is fruit trees, can these principles and principles that have been successfully applied to fruit trees be applied to microbiology, and how to apply them? How can Academician Lysenko's theory of stage development be implemented in microbiology and plant pathology? Williams proved that soil fertility and formation are inseparable from the role of microorganisms, but how can this theory serve plant pathology?

The presentation of these questions shows that through these studies, we are eager to apply these theories to practical work related to our own profession. However, in these works, there is too little material related to our own profession, especially in plant pathology. Therefore, after understanding these basic biological principles, it is necessary to collect professional materials, that is, to read a large number of professional or closely related papers.

In the early stages, I collected a large number of technical papers to read because they contained many specific methods and were easy to read. However, because my understanding of Michurin's biological science and creative Darwinism was still very superficial, I did not have the ability to use the weapon of dialectical materialism and the basic principles of Michurin-Lysenko's theory to understand the spiritual essence of each paper and to digest its essence to enrich my own way of thinking.

With the increase in Russian reading ability, I began to read discussion and controversial papers. In one year, I finished reading the collection of speeches from the All-Union Conference on Directed Variation and Selection of Microorganisms. After reading the criticisms and debates about these papers, I realized what kind of attitude should be used to evaluate a paper and how to implement the principles and principles of Michurin's biological science into microbiology work.

For example, the issue of the unity of organisms and the environment. Soviet microbiologists have changed the old views of pathology, epidemiology, and agricultural microbiology based on this principle, so that microbiology can better serve the national economy and the people's health.

The old pathological theory believes that a disease is caused by a seemingly unchanging pathogen, but in practice, it is impossible to explain some phenomena according to this view. For example, Somova found that the number of paracolon bacilli was particularly large in the intestines of patients with chronic dysentery, but the course of the disease was not shortened, indicating that E. coli obtained the pathogenicity of the latter after living with Shigella. Kalina found that E. coli changed their antigenic structure in the intestines of patients with typhoid fever and dysentery. There are many such examples. In general, pathogenic microorganisms may change their characteristics through unusual environments or in special microbial communities, and originally non-toxic microorganisms may also become toxic pathogens. Therefore, in identifying pathogens, if we do not start from the unity of microorganisms and their external environment, then many problems cannot be clarified.

There are similar situations in the old epidemiology. For example, it is generally accepted that polluted water sources are the source of typhoid fever epidemics, but typhoid bacilli are not easily isolated from water sources during typhoid fever epidemics. Some people say that typhoid bacilli die soon after entering the water, so how can water become the source of typhoid fever epidemics? From the research of Berloshina, we found that typhoid bacilli can be transformed into some physiologically and pathogenicity different strains in water, and these strains can restore their original state through certain animals. It can be seen that if epidemiologists do not engage in research to reveal the laws of variation of pathogens under natural conditions, then the prevention measures they design will not be completely reliable.

In agricultural microbiology, as is well known, rhizobium powder is widely used to increase the yield of legumes. But this is not the case in some areas of the Soviet Union. According to Litvinov's research, this is because rhizobium has its own specialization to host plants, its own requirements for soil conditions, and its response is different in different microbial communities in different regions. Therefore, applying a kind of rhizobium to different regions and different strains of plants will inevitably lead to different effects.

According to these basic viewpoints, if we examine our research work in plant pathology, we will find that there are many shortcomings. In general terms: First, the laws of variation of pathogens have not been correctly studied so far, so the relationship between pathogens and hosts cannot be well established. For example, many Fusarium or soft rot bacteria lose their pathogenicity soon after they are isolated, so that further research cannot be carried out. There are also many microorganisms that are considered saprophytic in nature that may become epidemic pathogens under certain conditions. For example, black chaff disease on wheat this year. Such problems must be studied from the laws of variation of microorganisms in order to truly solve the problems; Second, the study of the life history of pathogenic microorganisms has not been fully integrated with the external environment. For example, we study wheat rust, and we seem to know which organs rust produces with changes in the environment, and what temperature and humidity it requires; but we do not know what changes occur when these organs pass through the organic conditions of nature. According to the old view, they cannot be changed except for sexual hybridization and unknowable "mutations." Therefore, many problems have arisen in grasping the laws of occurrence of wheat rust, and they have not been well solved so far. Let us think about how the mycelium of rust bacteria can be affected by the latter when it passes through another host or the organism of another variety and changes. Unless we firmly do not accept the viewpoints of Michurin's biology, we have no reason not to study these problems clearly so that we can effectively control the epidemic of wheat rust.

Another example is the issue of the genetic conservatism and variability of microorganisms. Mendel-Morgan's genetics denies directed variation and the inheritance of acquired traits, and clings to the theory of "mutation." I myself used to explain variation phenomena in this way. For example, when I studied *Melanospora pampeana* in the past, I observed that a single-nucleated asexual spore could differentiate (or segregate) into eight different types in its offspring. According to chromosomal genetics, the chromosomes of these offspring should be equal, so how can so many different offspring be produced? Reactionary genetics cannot explain this phenomenon, and it is called "gene mutation." Why "mutation"? I don't know. Later, I found that one of the variants could easily return to its original state in its offspring. At that time, my explanation was "gene reversible" mutation, and I simply explained a biological phenomenon with a chemical formula. This is all because my deeply rooted metaphysical viewpoints led me to the wrong path.

Michurin's genetics clearly pointed out the reasons for this variation phenomenon. First of all, when an organism migrates from its natural environment to an unnatural environment, it will naturally assimilate the latter environment and change. The migration of *Melanospora pampeana* from the parasitic watermelon stem to the artificial culture medium after long-term cultivation is a great change in the environment. This change promotes the instability of its genetic conservatism and changes towards certain laboratory conditions. In the process of change, due to the different degrees of instability, the degree of change, and the degree of consolidation, many different types are formed. Among these types, some can be firmly inherited, some are uncertain and easy to restore to their original state, and some still maintain their original state. If I explain it according to this point of view and derive its laws, then this law can be used to study many other related problems in plant pathology and microbiology. However, the reactionary theory made my work ineffective. I have learned from this that without correct theoretical guidance in research work, nothing will be achieved.

Microorganisms must change in different environments, but this does not mean that microorganisms randomly change into amorphous things. Like higher organisms, microorganisms have their genetic conservatism, which can only be shaken under unusual living conditions. Then, is there a relationship between the instability of microbial genetic conservatism and the individual development and phylogenetic development of microorganisms? According to the research of Loginova and Komarova, microorganisms, like higher plants, are only easily shaken in the young stage of cells, and the younger they are, the easier they are to shake. Other Soviet microbiologists have also pointed out that microorganisms are most easily shaken in the filterable stage. The degree of genetic conservatism is related to the phylogenetic development of microorganisms, so different species of microorganisms have different difficulties and degrees of shaking due to their different phylogenetic developments.

In fact, it is not because microorganisms have less genetic conservatism than higher plants, but because of the small size of microorganisms and the frequent division or reproduction, they can be affected and assimilated by external environmental conditions in a short period of time. We can also observe their variations in a shorter period of time.

Based on these theories, Soviet microbiologists are beginning to create new microorganisms to serve medicine, agriculture, and industry.

In industrial microbiology, the method of cultivation (for example, gradually changing physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the culture) has been used to obtain many microorganisms with higher efficiency in industry; in agricultural microbiology, the method of induced cultivation (or asexual hybridization) has been used to obtain new varieties.

Currently, the Soviet Union is studying in medicine how to make pathogenic microorganisms lose their virulence while maintaining their antigenic structure for the preparation of various live vaccines.

In order to more scientifically change the nature of microorganisms so that microorganisms can be changed according to human will, the problem of stage development of microorganisms has been put on the research agenda in the Soviet Union. Only by mastering the requirements of each stage of development of microorganisms can we change microorganisms more predictably.

Another example is the problem of biological control of plant diseases. Williams pointed out the role of vegetation in soil fertility and also explained the relationship between vegetation and soil microbial communities. This concept has been developed in the Soviet Union to the biological control of plant diseases. Recently, Krasilnikov has a summary report on this work. He said: Since we have determined that there are mutual relationships between microorganisms, then we can also expect the relationship between microbial communities and plant pathogenic bacteria in the soil, the relationship between vegetation and pathogenic bacteria, and the relationship between all fertilizers and pathogenic bacteria.

According to this principle, we can understand why appropriate crop rotation, intercropping, fertilization, and the application of certain microbial antagonistic substances (including bactericidal organisms and antibiotic organisms) can lead to a certain disease prevention effect. If we analyze the various cultivation methods created by the working people of our country for thousands of years according to this principle, I believe that the prevention and control measures of plant pathology will have a huge innovation, and many problems that could not be solved in the past may be solved easily.

From the above analysis, our research work in microbiology is still stuck in the old place. Not to mention the medical aspects, in the agricultural aspects, we have not used the principles of Michurin's biology to create some microorganisms that are conducive to soil fertility and conducive to changing the relationship of soil microorganisms to achieve the purpose of preventing and controlling plant diseases. Such as strong and adaptable nitrifying bacteria; strong and specialized antagonistic microorganisms, etc. In the industrial field, in addition to antibiotic microorganisms such as penicillin and streptomycin, there is not much research and creation of fermentation microorganisms that are of great importance to the national economy. It is not that we cannot create them, but that we lacked correct theoretical guidance in the past.

How to Implement Advanced Scientific Theories into
Research Work

When I started learning advanced Soviet science, I didn't know how to implement it into our own work. Repeating other people's experiments without combining them with our own research materials would not have much practical significance. Through these years of study, I have realized that in order to implement advanced theories into our own work, we must be good at using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. In the early stages of learning, I only paid attention to using the scattered technologies of Soviet science, and did not consider the problem from the basic standpoint and viewpoint. Later, I realized that only by constantly criticizing the past and ongoing research work according to the advanced scientific theoretical viewpoint, exposing the shortcomings, promoting the advantages, and designing new research according to the actual requirements, can we continuously improve our ideological level and combine advanced theories with our work.

In the past two years, we have gradually implemented the principles and principles of Michurin's biological science in our research work. For example, we used the method of cultivation to create microbial antagonists (a kind of actinomycetes), we studied the biological relationship of crop rotation and intercropping in disease prevention, and we are also studying the variation of pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses, under the influence of external organic conditions. We believe that if we fully master these laws, then certain achievements can be obtained in the prevention and control of plant diseases and in the theory of microbial variation. Of course, our learning is still in the "starting" stage, but the existing achievements have strengthened our confidence in learning from the Soviet Union.

    学习米丘林学说及苏联微生物学的体会
    中国科学院真菌植物病理研究室研究员　裘维蕃
    四年来，在学习苏联先进科学的过程中，我走了一些弯路，也取得了一些经验。现在我想谈谈我在学习上的一些体会。
    学习苏联先进科学的基本条件
    根据四年来的学习经验，要学习苏联，首先得有正确的学习态度。
    我过去长期受的是资本主义的教育，形而上学的思想方法，孟德尔—摩尔根主义的观点已经顽固地札下了根，因此从一个相反的立场、观点、方法转一个一百八十度的弯，那不是一个轻描淡写的修正，而是一个痛苦的改造。
    解放后，觉得党和人民政府样样都对，事事都好，只是提出反对孟德尔—摩尔根主义的口号有些不合适。在思想上既然如此，对苏联的生物学便认为是“标新立异”。我所以开始阅读有关苏联生物科学的论文，主要是想摸一摸底，看看苏联生物科学到底“异”在什么地方。我曾花了不少时间读全苏列宁农业科学院一九四八年八月会议的报告和总结（英文本）。读完之后，思想还是站在旧的一边。记得在北京第一次讨论米丘林生物科学的会上，我第一个站立起来表示怀疑。由此可见，不准备放弃旧的，就无法接受新的。后来，学习米丘林生物科学的口号在科学界发生了很大的影响。自己觉得不懂得米丘林学说“吃不开”了，因此我才在口头上否定了“染色体与基因”的论点，搬弄了一套米丘林生物科学上的名词。这样的学习，我现在想来是一种“穿外套”的办法，希望用新的外套来掩盖旧的内容，这样的学习态度显然不能把我从形而上学的深渊中拯救出来。
    经过在华北人民革命大学学习和思想改造运动以后，初步端正了学习态度。但仅仅这样是不是就能一帆风顺地学下去呢？根据我的经验，不能，要好好学习苏联经验，还有两个不可缺少的因素。
    一个是经常的政治理论学习。先进的苏联科学是以辩证唯物主义为思想基础的。米丘林生物科学也就是辩证唯物主义在生物科学中的贯彻和实践。不懂得辩证唯物主义的基本原则，就无法学习和认识米丘林生物科学。譬如在学习的初期，我就无法想通为什么说“基因”学说是形而上学的，而“循环发生论”又是反进化论观点的。但自从认真学习了辩证唯物主义以后，我才体会到如果容许有这样不变的，不受外界环境影响的所谓“基因”的存在，那么生物的进化便成为不可想像的东西了。循环发生论者虽然承认微生物是有变异的，但是这种变异只限于一个循环往复的圈子中，认为一切变异不过是生活中的一个阶段，通过了这些阶段归根到底还是要回复到原状的。表面上看，他们似乎是承认变异了，而实质上正是否定了变异，否定了进化。在学习批判这些观点的过程中，辩证唯物主义的学习，在分析问题的全面性方面、事物的内在的联系方面以及事物的发展方面，给我以极大的帮助。
    通过了米丘林生物科学的学习，同时也巩固了政治理论学习。从前我总以为马克思列宁主义只是放之社会科学则“四海皆准”，通过这几年的学习从实质上认识到普遍的真理是无分社会科学和自然科学的。不只是革命需要马克思列宁主义思想指导，科学工作同样也需要马克思列宁主义的思想指导。没有这种指导，不仅无法学习，而且也不可能学好，更不用说“学以致用”了。
    另一个是掌握俄语。向苏联学习而不懂俄语是被动的学习。有限的翻译文献是不能满足科学研究工作者的需要的。自己感到面对着这样一个新知识的大海，作为一个“文盲”，太痛苦了，因此从一九五○年以后就坚持学习俄文。我的俄语程度的提高，不仅是随着时间而提高，而且是随着自己的思想认识的提高而提高。因为对学习苏联下了决心，有了信心，所以和过去学习任何一种外国语相比，其进步是最快的。自从自己逐渐能独立阅读和翻译以后，才掌握了苏联学库的钥匙。
    米丘林学说及创造性达尔文主义
    在微生物学中的贯彻
    “学以致用”是我们学习任何理论或经验首先要提出来的问题。在学习米丘林学说的过程中，我就产生了一些疑问：如米丘林的主要研究对象是果树，那末这些在果树上应用得很有成效的原理、原则是否能应用到微生物学中去，而且怎样来应用呢？李森科院士的阶段发育学说又如何贯彻到微生物学中以及植物病理学中呢？威廉姆士证明了土壤的肥力和形成及微生物的作用是不可分割的，但是这种学说又如何为植物病理学服务呢？
    这些问题的提出，说明了通过这些学习，急待把这些理论应用到和自己专业有关的实际工作中去。但是在这些著作中，和自己专业相关的，特别是植物病理学方面的材料那是太少了。因此在了解了这些基本的生物学原理以后，就有必要去收集专业的材料，也就是大量阅读专业的或和专业密切相关的论文。
    初期，我大量收集技术性的论文来阅读，原因是其中有许多具体方法，而且易读；但是由于我对米丘林生物科学、创造性达尔文主义的认识还很肤浅，还没有能力运用辩证唯物主义的武器、米丘林—李森科学说的基本原理来体会每一篇论文的精神实质，来消化它的精华以丰富自己的思想方法。
    随着俄文阅读能力的增长，开始阅读讨论性的和争论性的论文。在一年中读完了全苏微生物定向变异及选种会议的发言集。在阅读了关于这些论文的批评和争辩的文章以后，我才认识到应该用怎样的态度去评价一篇论文，和怎样才能把米丘林生物科学的原理、原则贯彻到微生物学工作中去。
    例如生物和环境的统一问题。苏联微生物学家根据这一原理改变了旧的病原学的观点，改变了流行病学的观点，改变了农业微生物学的观点，使微生物学能更好地为国民经济服务，为人民的保健事业服务。
    旧的病原学说认为一种疾病是由一种似乎是不变的病原菌所致的，但在实践中，按照这种观点就无法来解释一些现象。譬如，索莫娃在慢性痢疾患者的肠部，发现副系的数量特别多，而病程并未缩短，说明了大肠杆菌同痢疾杆菌共同生活以后获得了后者的致病力。卡里娜在伤寒病患者和痢疾患者的肠部发现大肠杆菌改变了它们的抗原结构。这样的实例很多。总的说来，病原微生物通过不平常的环境或处于特殊的微生物联合生活中就有可能改变其特性，原来无毒的微生物也可能成为有毒的病原。因此，在鉴定病原方面，如果不从微生物为其外界环境的统一体上出发，那末，许多问题就无法搞清。
    在旧的流行病学方面也有类似的情况。譬如说，一般都承认污染的水源是伤寒流行的源泉，但在伤寒流行期内在水源中却不容易分离出伤寒杆菌。有人说伤寒杆菌在水中不久便死亡了，那末水又怎能成为伤寒流行的源泉呢？我们从柏洛希娜的研究中，发现了伤寒杆菌在水中转变成为一些在生理上、致病力上完全不同的菌种，这些菌种通过了一定的动物又能恢复其原状。由此可见，流行病学家如果不从事于揭发病原菌在自然条件下变异的规律的研究，那末，他们所设计的预防措施将不可能彻底可靠。
    在农业微生物学方面，如所周知，根瘤菌粉是广泛地用来使豆科植物增产的。但在苏联也有一些地区并不是这样。根据李特维诺夫的研究，这是因为根瘤菌有它自己对寄主植物的专化性，有它自己对土壤条件的要求，而且在不同地区的不同的微生物联合生活中，它的反应也是不一样的。因此，把一种根瘤菌应用于不同地区，不同品系的植物上，必然会导致不一样的效果。
    根据这些基本观点来检查一下我们在植物病理学方面的研究工作，就发现存在不少的缺点。从大的方面来讲：一、至今还没有正确地研究病原菌变异的规律，因此不能很好地确立病原和寄主的关系。譬如有许多镰刀菌或软腐病菌分离出来以后，不久便失去它们的致病力，以致无法作进一步的研究。又如有许多在自然界认为是腐生的微生物可能在一定的条件下成为流行的病原菌。例如今年小麦上的黑頴病。诸如此类的问题必须要从微生物的变异规律来加以研究，才能真正解决问题；二、病原微生物生活史的研究还没有全面地和外界环境统一起来。例如我们研究小麦锈菌，对于锈菌随着环境的变化不断产生那些器官，和它要求什么温度和湿度，似乎是知道的了；但是这些器官在通过自然界的有机条件时发生了些什么变化却不知道。按照旧的观点，它们除了有性杂交及不可知的“突变”以外是不可能改变的。因此在掌握小麦锈病发生的规律中发生了许多问题，而且至今也没有很好地解决。我们想一想，当锈病菌的菌丝体通过另一种寄主或另一个品种的有机体时，如何能不受后者的影响而起变异。除非我们坚决不接受米丘林生物学的观点，否则我们就没有理由不把这些问题研究清楚，使我们真正有效地控制小麦锈病的流行。
    又如微生物的遗传保守性及其变异性的问题。孟德尔——摩尔根的遗传学说否定了定向变异，否定了获得性状的遗传，死抱住“突变”论不放。我自己也曾经这样地来解释变异现象。例如过去我研究小黑壳囊菌时，曾观察到一个单核的无性孢子，在它的后代中能分化（或分离）成八种不同的类型。按照染色体的遗传学，这些后代的染色体应该是相等的，那末怎样会产生这样多不同的后代呢？反动遗传学无法解释这种现象，便称之为“基因的突变”。为什么“突变”呢？不知道。后来我又发现其中的一个变系，在其后代中很容易回复原状。那时我的解释是“基因的可逆性”突变，简单地把一个生物学的现象用化学公式来解释了。这都是由于我的根深柢固的形而上学的观点，引导我走向错误的道路。
    米丘林遗传学很明确地指出了这种变异现象的原因。首先，一种生物从它的自然环境迁移到不自然的环境中后，当然会同化后一环境而发生变异。小黑壳囊菌之从寄生的西瓜茎上迁移到人工培养基上，经过长期的培养后，就是一个很大的环境的改变。这种改变促使其遗传保守性动摇，并且向着一定的实验室条件改变。在改变的过程中，由于动摇的程度、改变的程度以及巩固的程度的不同，形成了许多不同的类型。这些类型中，有些能巩固地遗传下去，有些则摇摆不定，容易恢复其原状，另有一些则仍旧保持原状。如果我根据这样的观点来解释而得出其规律，那么这一规律正可以用来研究植物病理学和微生物学中的许多其它与此相关的问题。但是反动的理论，使我的这种工作毫无成效。我由此体会到在研究工作中没有正确的理论指导，将一事无成。
    微生物在不同的环境中必然是要改变的，但这并不等于说微生物随便改变为不定型的东西。微生物同高等有机体一样，有其遗传的保守性，这种保守性只有在对它们不平常的生活条件下才能动摇。那末，微生物遗传保守性的动摇和微生物的个体发育及系统发育又是否有关系呢？根据洛吉诺娃和科玛洛娃的研究，微生物和高等植物一样，只有在细胞幼小的时期才易于动摇，而且愈幼小愈易动摇。苏联的其他微生物学家也指出了，微生物在可滤性阶段其遗传保守性最易动摇。遗传保守性的程度又是和微生物的系统发育相关联，因此不同种的微生物，由于它们系统发育的不同，动摇的难易和程度也有差别。
    事实上并不是因为微生物比高等植物较少遗传保守性，而是由于微生物体积的微小，分裂或繁殖的频繁，因此在较短期内就可能接受外界环境条件的影响而加以同化。我们也就有可能在较短的时期内观察到它们的变异。
    苏联微生物学家根据这些理论，正在开始创造新的微生物，使它们为医药、农业和工业服务。
    在工业微生物学方面，利用教养的方法（例如在培养中逐渐改变物理、化学和生物的条件等）获得了许多在工业上效率更高的微生物；在农业微生物学方面曾利用了诱导培养的方法（或称无性杂交）获得了新的品种。
    目前苏联在医学方面正在研究如何使致病微生物失去其毒力而保持其抗原结构，以作为制备各种活菌苗之用。
    为了要更科学地改变微生物的本质，使微生物能按照人类的意志加以改变，微生物的阶段发育问题，在苏联已经提到研究日程上来了。只有掌握了微生物的各发育阶段的要求，才能更有预见地来改变微生物。
    再如植物病害的生物防治问题。威廉姆士曾指出植被对于土壤肥力的作用，也说明了植被对于土壤微生物群落的关系。这一观念在苏联已经发展到植物病害的生物防治上。最近克拉西尔尼科夫关于这方面的工作有一篇总结性的报告，他说：我们既然确定了微生物有相互之间的关系，那末我们也可以预期微生物群落对土壤中植物致病菌的关系，植被对致病菌的关系，一切肥料对致病菌的关系。
    根据这一原理，就可以理解为什么适当的轮作、间作、施肥以及一定的微生物相克体（包括消菌生物及抗生生物）的施用能导致一定的防病作用。如果我们对我国千余年来劳动人民创造的各种耕作方法，按照这一原理加以分析，我相信，植物病理学的防治措施将有巨大的革新，而许多过去无法解决的问题，也可能迎刃而解了。
    从上面的分析来看，我们的微生物学的研究工作，还停留在老的地方。暂且不谈医学方面，在农业方面我们并没有利用米丘林生物学的原理创造一些有利于土壤肥力，有利于改变土壤微生物关系而达到防治植物病害目的的微生物种。如强力的、有适应性的硝酸化细菌；强力的、有专化性的相克性微生物等。在工业方面，除了青霉素、链霉素一类的抗生微生物外，对国民经济有重大关系的发酵微生物的研究和创造也不多。我们不是不能创造，而是在过去缺少正确的理论指导。
    怎样使先进的科学理论贯彻到
    研究工作中去
    在我开始学习苏联的先进科学时，不知道怎样使它贯彻到我们自己的工作中去。重复人家的试验而不和我们自己的研究材料相结合就没有多大的实际意义了。通过这些年来的学习，认识到要将先进理论贯彻到自己的工作中去，必须要善于利用批评和自我批评的武器。我在学习的初期，只注意搬用苏联科学的零星技术，而没有从基本的立场、观点上来考虑问题。后来才体会到，只有根据先进的科学理论观点，不断地批判过去的以及正在进行的研究工作，揭发缺点，发扬优点，并根据实际的要求设计新的研究，才能不断地提高自己的思想水平，使先进的理论能和自己的工作结合起来。
    这两年来我们在研究工作中已经逐步地贯彻了米丘林生物科学的原理和原则。例如我们用教养的方法创造了微生物相克体（放线菌的一种），我们研究了轮作及间作在防病上的生物关系，我们也在研究致病微生物，包括病毒在外界有机条件影响下的变异。我们相信，如果完全掌握了这些规律，那末在植物病害的防治上以及在微生物变异的理论上都可能获得一定的成就。当然，我们的学习还在“开步走”的阶段，但目前已有的一些成绩却增强了我们学习苏联的信心。
