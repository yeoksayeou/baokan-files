Chiang Kai-shek bandits Rampantly Massacre Our Large Numbers of Fishermen Off the Coast of Fujian

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has recently become even more rampant in carrying out pirate activities off the coast of Fujian, creating new and serious crimes of kidnapping and killing large numbers of our fishermen.

On October 20th, Chiang's navy kidnapped and plundered 236 fishermen and 13 fishing boats from Meihua Town, Changle County, in the Huangqi waters of Lianjiang County. On October 3rd, Chiang's troops kidnapped and plundered 6 fishermen and 1 fishing boat from Dinghai Town, Lianjiang County, in the waters north of Gaodeng Island.

The Chiang bandit troops subjected the fishermen they kidnapped to extremely brutal torture. According to Cheng Zhongchun, a fisherman from Dinghai Town, Lianjiang County, who escaped from Matsu Island, which is occupied by Chiang's bandit troops, after they and six others on the boat were kidnapped to Matsu Island, Chiang's bandit troops forced them to reveal the situation in our coastal areas, but they all remained silent. Then, Chiang's bandit troops subjected them to all kinds of torture. The fisherman Huang Zuokuo was subjected to electric shock by Chiang's bandit troops. Then, Chiang's bandit troops poured nitric acid into his face and nose, and his face and nose immediately rotted. The old fisherman Cheng Zhongchun, who had just recovered from illness, was beaten severely and then forced to raise his hands and kneel on a chair for five hours, fainting several times in a row.

Another fisherman, Cai Yihuo, who recently escaped from Matsu Island, accused that on October 20th, after 236 fishermen who were fishing in the Huangqi waters were kidnapped to Matsu Island by three Chiang bandit warships, they were also subjected to brutal torture. Chiang's bandit troops forced Chen Renmu, Chen Kongle, and 34 others to come out from among the fishermen and forced them to kneel on piles of broken tiles for interrogation one by one. When Chiang's bandit troops interrogated Chen Renmu, they first beat him violently with a gun butt and then stabbed him in the leg with a bayonet, and blood flowed immediately, which was terrible to witness. Chen Kongle was also beaten unconscious by Chiang's bandit troops. Later, Chiang's bandit troops locked the fishermen in caves and interrogated them in shifts for two days and two nights.

After hearing about these atrocities of the Chiang bandits, the fishermen in various coastal areas of Fujian were filled with old and new hatred, and they expressed their determination to avenge their suffering brothers. Xiaxi Township on Chongwu Peninsula in Hui'an County held a general meeting of fishermen to denounce the crimes of the Chiang bandits. The fishermen of Dinghai Town in Lianjiang County and Meihua Town in Changle County were also very angry after hearing the news that their fisherman brothers were kidnapped by the Chiang bandits and suffered torture, and expressed their determination to actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands.

    蒋贼在福建沿海猖狂残害我大批渔民
    蒋介石卖国集团最近更加猖狂地在福建沿海进行海盗活动，造成绑架和残害我大批渔民的新的严重罪行。
    十月二十日，蒋贼海军在连江县黄岐海面绑架和劫夺我长乐县梅花镇渔民二百三十六名、渔船十三艘。在十月三日，蒋贼军在高登屿以北海面绑架和劫夺我连江县定海镇渔民六人、渔船一艘。
    蒋贼军对被他们绑架去的渔民施行了极其残暴的严刑拷打。据从蒋贼军盘踞的马祖岛逃回来的连江县定海镇渔民程忠椿控诉说，他们同船六人被劫上马祖岛以后，蒋贼军强迫他们说出我沿海地区的情况，但他们都闭口不言，接着蒋贼军就对他们施行了种种酷刑。渔民黄作阔被蒋贼军上了电刑。接着蒋贼军又用硝镪水泼到他的脸上和灌进他的鼻孔里，脸和鼻子立刻都腐烂了。患病刚好的老渔民程忠椿被毒打后，又被强迫举起双手在椅子上跪了五小时之久，接连昏倒了好几次。
    最近从马祖岛逃回来的另一个渔民蔡依伙控诉说，十月二十日，正在黄岐海面捕鱼的二百三十六名渔民被蒋贼军三艘舰艇劫到马祖岛后，也备受了残暴的酷刑拷打。蒋贼军迫令陈仁木、陈孔乐等三十六人从渔民中走出来，并强迫他们跪在碎瓦堆上进行逐个拷问。蒋贼军拷问陈仁木时，先用枪托猛打，又用刺刀刺进了他的腿部，当即鲜血直流，惨不忍睹。陈孔乐也被蒋贼军打得晕了过去。后来，蒋贼军又把渔民们关在山洞里进行了两天两夜的轮番拷问。
    福建沿海各地渔民听到蒋贼这些暴行后，旧恨新仇交织一起，纷纷表示要为受难兄弟报仇。惠安县崇武半岛霞西乡曾举行全乡渔民大会，控诉蒋贼罪行。连江县定海镇和长乐县梅花镇的渔民，听到渔民兄弟被蒋贼绑去后受尽毒刑的消息后也都非常愤怒，表示一定要积极支援人民解放军解放台湾和沿海岛屿。　　（新华社）
