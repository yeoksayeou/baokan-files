    The rural work in this winter and next spring is very intense. Party organizations at all levels must continue to mobilize the strength of the entire party, closely integrate with the current central work, and continue to deeply conduct socialist ideological education for farmers. This is the most powerful guarantee for completing the rural work tasks in this winter and next spring.
    Many local Party organizations lack regular leadership in educating farmers. Often there is publicity when a movement comes, and the publicity stops when the movement ends. They rarely summarize the experiences and lessons of a publicity campaign, and rarely check what ideological problems among the masses have been initially resolved after the movement, what ideological doubts have not been resolved, and what new ideological problems have arisen among the farmers as the work progresses. They also fail to deploy regular publicity work based on investigation and research into the ideological situation of the masses. The reason for this situation is that some cadres still do not fully understand the long-term and arduous nature of educating farmers. On the one hand, they overestimate the achievements of the general line propaganda in the past winter and this spring. At the same time, they do not understand the need to repeatedly educate farmers, and they think that the principles of the general line have already been explained to the farmers, and there is nothing new to talk about. This idea is obviously very wrong and dangerous.
    The general line propaganda and education in the past winter and this spring have obviously improved the socialist consciousness of rural cadres and the masses, and promoted the socialist transformation of agriculture. The achievements are great. However, some ideological doubts existing among some farmers about the mutual aid and cooperation movement have not been eliminated. In the guidance of the cooperative movement, although the general policy of active and steady progress has been adopted to promote the healthy development of the movement, the leadership in some counties and districts still ignores different regions and different conditions, and there are still varying degrees of blind optimism and the idea of ​​greed for quantity, greed for size and greed for speed. The mutual aid and cooperation movement has made great progress in the past year. More than 100,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established, and most of them have achieved increased production, showing its superiority. The newly organized cooperatives have basically been consolidated, and only a very few have collapsed. The achievements are great. However, things are not all smooth sailing within many agricultural producers' cooperatives. In some places, rich peasant elements have sneaked in, and the phenomenon of discrimination and exclusion of poor peasants is still very serious, and the work of uniting with middle peasants is not well done. This shows that due to the lack of ideological education, some rural work cadres and farmers have a vague understanding of the Party's complete class line in implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Some cadres also do not realize that agricultural producers' cooperatives are only transitional forms of a semi-socialist nature, and do not understand that organization does not mean the end of socialist ideological education and socialist transformation for farmers, but only the beginning. Some comrades mistakenly believe that with agricultural producers' cooperatives, there is complete socialism; and that members who participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives are socialists. This is a big mistake. The existence of phenomena such as lax labor discipline, failure to cherish public property, and hindering public interests with personal interests in many agricultural producers' cooperatives at present shows that educating and transforming organized farmers, eliminating their individualism, and gradually making them socialist laborers still requires a long period of arduous work.
    On the basis of in-depth socialist ideological education, the planned purchase and planned supply work in rural areas has also achieved great success in the past year and has won the support of the broad masses of people, which is also beyond doubt. But it should also be seen that it is still a very arduous educational task to make rural grassroots cadres and farmers understand the importance of incorporating rural production and consumption into the national plan, and understand the principle of mutual support between workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, cities and villages under the leadership of the working class. Some farmers and some grassroots cadres still have many confused ideas about planned purchase and planned supply, which often cannot be answered, and no one even dares to answer. We must not think that there is nothing to publicize because we have done a lot of publicity and education work. On the contrary, many major issues, even seemingly ordinary issues, require us to continue to carry out in-depth publicity. For farmers, as Lenin said: "Propaganda is of course necessary, and there is no need to be afraid of repeating it again and again, because what seems to us to be repetition may not be repetition for hundreds of thousands of farmers, but the first truth they have discovered." ("Speech at the First Congress of Agricultural Communes and Agricultural Labor Associations") We should understand the important meaning of Lenin's passage and earnestly strengthen the leadership of ideological education work for farmers.
    In the future, what issues should we focus on when publicizing socialist ideas to farmers?
    We must continue to publicize the national socialist industrialization policy, and explain the idea that realizing socialist industrialization and first developing heavy industry is the fundamental interest of the people of the whole country and also the fundamental interest of farmers. In view of the fact that in the past period, our socialist industrialization propaganda to farmers mostly focused on light industry, the relationship between industrialization and farmers' daily life, and the benefits that farmers have already received, while the realization of socialist industrialization is the most fundamental and long-term interest of the country and the people, and the relationship between socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture in the future has not been publicized enough. This situation has led to many farmers having a one-sided understanding of the country's socialist industrialization; to the extent that it affects farmers' attitudes towards the country's major measures in rural areas, and affects the implementation of the country's policies. This must be changed.
    We must continue to publicize the country's construction plan and the idea of ​​obeying the national plan. On this issue, we must avoid the shortcomings in the propaganda in the past period, where there was more propaganda about the beautiful prospects of socialism, and not enough propaganda about the idea that we must work hard and obey the national plan in order to build socialism. We must make farmers understand that implementing planned purchases is not detrimental to farmers, but beneficial to all farmers, and only detrimental to unscrupulous merchants. We must educate farmers to understand that implementing quantitative distribution is the only correct way to ensure reasonable consumption by the people and prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and driving up prices in the situation of supply exceeding demand; we must make farmers understand that the shortage of certain daily consumer goods is not due to the too fast pace of socialist industrialization, but precisely because the country's industry and agriculture are too backward, and it is not that urban people's lives are too good and the supply is too much, but because the production of consumer goods is insufficient. Only by working hard to produce, striving to support national industrialization, and gradually realizing agricultural cooperation can we gradually improve our living standards. Repeatedly explaining these principles to farmers, guiding farmers to establish an overall concept, obeying long-term interests, actively taking the road of cooperation, striving to develop production, saving consumption, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, supporting the country's socialist industrialization, and supporting farmers in disaster areas, and selling all surplus grain to the country is an urgent task in the current rural propaganda.
    We must continue to publicize the country's agricultural cooperation policy, and publicize the Party's systematic class policy of relying on poor peasants (including new middle peasants) in rural areas, firmly uniting with middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating the rich peasant economy. There are still many places where the Party's class policy is not publicized enough, and some places even dare not publicize this policy, which is wrong. It should be known that making farmers understand the Party's policy can greatly encourage and promote the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and middle peasants for socialist construction and socialist transformation, which is more conducive to strengthening the unity of poor and middle peasants, which is more conducive to restricting and isolating rich peasants, and which is more conducive to promoting agricultural cooperation. In the propaganda on the issue of unity between poor and middle peasants, on the one hand, we should make poor and middle peasants understand the principles of mutual help and care, and on the other hand, we must also make them understand that this unity must be established on the basis of actively taking the socialist road, and make them understand that only cooperation and socialism are the common and greatest interests of poor and middle peasants. On the issue of dealing with rich peasants, we should also educate farmers to be vigilant against the influence of rich peasants and their sabotage activities.
    We must also continue to publicize the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. On this issue, we must publicize the mutual support between workers and peasants, industry and agriculture in the struggle for socialist construction and socialist transformation, and also publicize the leading role of the working class; we must publicise that without the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, without the efforts of the entire working class, there would be no socialism, and also publicize that without the efforts of the peasants, the construction of socialism would also be impossible. We should make rural party member cadres and the broad masses of farmers understand the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance, and understand that continuously consolidating and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation for guaranteeing the victory of our socialist cause.
    The above should become some basic ideological content of rural propaganda for a considerable period in the future.
    However, it must be noted that socialist propaganda to farmers cannot be carried out abstractly, but must be carried out continuously through the publicity and explanation of major policies and major tasks in each period. Our major tasks and major policies in rural areas are the task and policy of implementing socialist transformation of agriculture, and educating farmers and implementing socialist transformation are originally an inseparable whole. Only when our socialist propaganda is closely combined with tasks and policies can our propaganda work become concrete, closely combined with reality, have combat effectiveness and regularity, and make this propaganda and education work conducive to the current socialist transformation work, and make our propaganda avoid the problem of empty talk. The combination of theory and practice is the most important law for improving the level of the Party's propaganda work, and we must firmly grasp this law to continuously improve the ideology and combat effectiveness of the Party's propaganda work.
    To carry out socialist ideological education for farmers, we should be good at combining examples and carrying out through farmers' personal experiences. This is a very important experience in the general line propaganda in the past winter and this spring. In the future, in rural propaganda, we should more widely adopt the method of guiding the masses of farmers to start from their personal experiences and feelings, present the situation, evaluate the good and the bad, and summarize the mutual aid and cooperation movement and various unified purchase and sales work in the past year, in order to inspire farmers to conduct self-education and further improve the socialist consciousness of farmers. Through such a summary method, we can guide farmers to correctly analyze the great changes and great victories caused by the implementation of the Party's various policies in all aspects of rural areas, and inspire farmers to recognize that it is precisely because of the implementation of these major policies and measures of agricultural socialist transformation that prices can continue to remain stable, and the supply in rural areas, especially to disaster areas, can be reliably guaranteed, socialist industrialization can advance rapidly, socialist factors in rural areas can be further developed, the capitalist forces in rural areas can be further weakened, farmers' production can have new growth, and life can be initially improved. All this proves that our country and the farmers themselves have benefited, proves that the policies of the Party and the country are completely correct, and are beneficial to farmers in every way without any harm, and any doubts and misunderstandings about these major policies and measures are unfounded. Through such a summary method, we can also guide farmers to correctly understand the temporary difficulties in the victorious advance and the ways to correctly treat these difficulties and overcome these temporary difficulties, and improve the enthusiasm and confidence of the broad masses of farmers in struggling for socialism.
    We must be good at making the masses understand the unity of personal interests and national interests, the unity of current interests and long-term interests through propaganda, and make the masses consciously subordinate personal interests to national interests and subordinate current interests to long-term interests. Our propaganda work often has the problem of one-sidedness. Sometimes our propaganda is prone to only talking about empty grand principles, but failing to connect with the personal interests and current practical problems of the masses, and sometimes it is prone to only focusing on the current personal interests of the masses, but neglecting the propaganda about national interests and long-term interests. Both of these biases are bad, and the latter bias has been more prominent in rural propaganda in the recent period. For example, in publicizing the unified purchase of grain, we only calculate the grain accounts, but neglect the publicity and explanation of the great significance of the unified purchase of grain for ensuring the country's industrialization construction; in publicizing the planned supply of cotton cloth, we only calculate the cotton cloth accounts, but do not explain the fundamental principles of the planned supply of cotton cloth. There are similar situations in other propaganda such as the unified purchase of cotton and mutual aid and cooperation. These situations must be improved.
    The prerequisite for educating farmers is to educate cadres and party members. Because the major policies and tasks of the Party and the government must be completed through the vast number of cadres to publicize to the farmers and lead the farmers. Many places are now convening or preparing to convene meetings of Party cadres at all levels and meetings of Party representatives. Party organizations at all levels should use the meeting to seize the opportunity to conduct ideological education for cadres and party members, improve their socialist consciousness, eliminate their ideological concerns, and clearly explain the working methods, so that they can continue to adhere to the method of education and persuasion to mobilize the broad masses of farmers and successfully complete the various work tasks of socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 必须继续深入地对农民进行社会主义思想宣传

    必须继续深入地对农民进行社会主义思想宣传
    今冬明春的农村工作是十分紧张的。各级党的组织必须继续动员全党的力量，紧紧结合当前中心工作，继续深入地向农民进行社会主义思想教育，这是完成今冬明春农村工作任务的最强有力的保证。
    有许多党的地方组织对教育农民缺乏经常的领导，常常是运动一来就有宣传，运动结束宣传也就停顿。他们很少总结一个宣传运动的经验教训，很少检查一下运动过后群众中那些思想问题已经初步解决了，那些思想疑虑还没有解决，随着工作前进，农民群众中又产生了那些新的思想问题，并根据对群众思想情况的调查研究，来部署经常的宣传工作。产生这种情况的原因，是目前仍然还有一些干部，对教育农民的长期性、艰苦性认识不足。他们一方面过高估计了去冬今春总路线宣传的成绩，同时又不了解必须反复教育农民的道理，自以为总路线的道理都已经向农民讲过了，没有什么新内容可讲了，这种想法，显然是十分错误而且危险的。
    去冬今春的总路线宣传教育显然提高了农村干部与群众的社会主义觉悟，推进了对农业的社会主义改造，成绩是很大的。可是，部分农民中间对互助合作运动所存在的一些思想疑虑并不是已经消除了。在对合作化运动的指导上，一般虽然都采取了积极稳步的方针，使运动健全地向前发展，可是，在某些县区的领导上忽视不同地区、不同条件，仍然存在着不同程度的盲目乐观情绪和贪多贪大贪快的思想。一年来的互助合作运动有了很大的发展，十多万个农业生产合作社，已经成立起来，而且绝大部分都达到了增产，显出它的优越性，新组织的社基本上也都巩固下来了，垮台的是极个别的，成绩是很大的。可是，在许多农业生产合作社内部也并不是万事大吉的。有的地方富农分子混进去了，有的社歧视和排斥贫农的现象也还很严重，也有对团结中农做得不好的。这说明由于思想教育的不足，某些农村工作干部和农民群众，对党在实行农业社会主义改造中的完整的阶级路线认识是模糊的。也有一些干部，并没有认识农业生产合作社还仅仅只是半社会主义性质的过渡形式，不了解组织起来决不是意味着对于农民社会主义思想教育和社会主义改造的结束而只是开始。有些同志错误地以为有了农业生产合作社，就是有了全部的社会主义；参加农业生产合作社的社员就是社会主义者了。这是大错特错的。目前不少的农业生产合作社中劳动纪律松弛、不爱护公共财产、以个人利益妨害公共利益等现象的存在，正是说明教育和改造组织起来的农民，消除他们的个人主义心理，使他们逐步成为社会主义劳动者，还需要进行很长时期的艰苦的工作。
    在深入的社会主义思想教育的基础上，一年来农村中各项计划收购和计划供应工作也取得了很大的成绩，获得广大人民群众的拥护，这也是没有任何疑问的。可是同样应该看到要使农村基层干部和农民都懂得把农村的生产和消费纳入国家计划的重要意义，懂得在工人阶级领导下建立工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村之间的相互支援的道理，仍然是十分艰巨的教育任务。部分农民和某些基层干部中，对计划收购和计划供应还存在许多混乱思想，常常得不到解答，甚至没有人敢解答。我们决不能因为做了许多宣传教育工作，就以为没有什么需要宣传的了。恰恰相反，许多重大的问题甚至于看起来似乎很平常的问题，都正需要我们继续不断地深入地进行宣传。对于农民，正如列宁所说的：“宣传当然是必要的，再三重复是用不着害怕的，因为对于我们似乎是重复，而对于成千成万的农民也许会不是重复，而是他们第一次发现的真理。”（“在农业公社和农业劳动组合第一次代表大会上的演说”）我们应该懂得列宁这段话的重要意义，切实加强对农民的思想教育工作的领导。
    今后，对农民宣传社会主义思想，应该着重那些问题呢？
    我们要继续宣传国家的社会主义工业化方针，说明实现社会主义工业化和首先发展重工业，是全国人民的根本利益，也是农民的根本利益的思想。鉴于过去一个时期，我们对农民所进行的社会主义工业化宣传，多半偏重于轻工业方面，偏重于工业化和农民日常生活的关系方面，偏重于农民已经得到的利益方面，而对于实现社会主义工业化是国家和人民的最根本的利益和长远利益，对于社会主义工业化和今后农业社会主义改造的关系等就宣传得不够。这种情形就造成了许多农民对国家的社会主义工业化发生片面的了解；以至于影响到农民对待国家在农村中的各项重大措施的态度，影响到国家各项政策的贯彻。这是必须加以改变的。
    我们要继续宣传国家的建设计划和服从国家计划的思想。在这个问题上，必须避免过去一个时期宣传中，对社会主义的美好前途宣传得较多，而对于为着建设社会主义就必须艰苦奋斗和服从国家计划的思想则宣传得不够的缺点。要使农民懂得，实行计划收购不是对农民不利，而是对全体农民都有利，只是对奸商不利的。要教育农民懂得，实行定量分配是在供不应求情况下保障人民合理消费，防止奸商囤积抬价的唯一正确办法；要使农民懂得，某些日用消费品供应不足也不是由于社会主义工业化的速度太快，而恰恰是由于国家的工业和农业太落后，也不是城市人民生活太好，供应太多，而是由于消费物资生产量不足，只有努力生产努力支援国家工业化逐步实现农业合作化，才能逐步提高生活水平。反复向农民说清楚这些道理，引导农民树立整体观念，服从长远利益，积极走合作化道路，努力发展生产，节约消费，支援解放台湾，支援国家社会主义工业化，支援灾区农民，把余粮全部卖给国家，这是当前农村宣传中一项急迫的任务。
    我们要继续宣传国家的农业合作化政策，宣传党在农村中依靠贫农（包括新中农在内），巩固地团结中农，限制和逐步消灭富农经济这一系统的阶级政策。现在仍有很多地方对党的这一阶级政策宣传得很不够，有的地方甚至不敢宣传这一政策，这是不对的。应当知道，使农民了解党的这一政策，就可以更大地鼓舞和促进广大贫农和中农对于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的积极性，就更有利于加强贫中农的团结，就更有利于限制和孤立富农，就更有利于推进农业的合作化。在关于贫农和中农团结问题的宣传上，一方面应当使贫农和中农懂得相互帮助和照顾的道理，另一方面也必须使他们了解这种团结必须建立在积极走社会主义道路的基础上，使他们了解唯有合作化和社会主义才是贫农和中农共同的最大利益。在对待富农问题上，还应当教育农民警惕富农的影响以及他们的破坏活动。
    还要继续宣传工农联盟的重要性。在这个问题上既要宣传在为社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗中工人和农民、工业和农业的相互支持，也要宣传工人阶级的领导作用；既要宣传没有工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党的领导，没有全体工人阶级的努力，就没有社会主义，也要宣传没有农民的努力，社会主义的建设也是不可能的。应当使农村党员干部和广大农民了解工农联盟的重大意义，了解不断巩固和加强工农联盟是保证我们社会主义事业胜利的基础。
    以上这些应该成为今后相当时期内农村宣传的一些基本思想内容。
    但是必须注意，对农民的社会主义宣传，不能抽象地来进行，而必须不断地通过每个时期的重大政策和重大任务的宣传解释来进行。我们在农村的重大任务和重大政策，就是对农业实行社会主义改造的任务和政策，教育农民和实行社会主义改造本来是不可分割的整体。只有我们的社会主义宣传同任务政策紧密结合了，我们的宣传工作才能够成为具体的，密切结合实际的，具有战斗性和经常性的宣传，才能使这种宣传教育工作有利于当前社会主义改造工作，才能使我们的宣传避免空洞说教的毛病。理论与实际相结合，是提高党的宣传工作水平的一条最重要的规律，我们必须紧紧掌握这条规律来不断提高党的宣传工作的思想性和战斗性。
    对农民进行社会主义思想教育，应该善于结合实例和通过农民的切身经验来进行，这是去冬今春总路线宣传中的一条很重要的经验。今后在农村宣传中，应当更广泛地采取引导农民群众从切身经验和体会出发，摆情况、评好坏，总结一年来互助合作运动和各项统购统销工作，以启发农民进行自我教育的方法，去进一步提高农民的社会主义觉悟。通过这样的总结方法，就可以引导农民正确地分析由于党的各项政策的实行在农村各方面所引起的巨大变化和巨大的胜利，启发农民认识正是由于这些农业社会主义改造的重大政策措施实行的结果，物价才能继续保持稳定，农村的供应特别是对灾区的供应才有了可靠的保证，社会主义工业化才能迅速前进，农村中社会主义因素才有了进一步发展，农村中的资本主义势力才被进一步削弱，农民的生产才有了新的增长，生活才有初步改善。凡此都证明我们国家和农民自己都得到了好处，证明了党和国家的政策是完全正确的，对农民是有百利而无一害的，任何对这些重大政策措施的怀疑误解是没有根据的。通过这样的总结方法，又可以引导农民正确地认识在胜利前进中的暂时困难和正确对待这些困难、克服这些暂时困难的办法，提高广大农民为社会主义而奋斗的积极性和信心。
    我们要善于通过宣传，使群众认识个人利益和国家利益的一致性，认识目前利益和长远利益的一致性，并使群众自觉地把个人利益服从国家利益，把目前利益服从长远利益。我们的宣传工作常常容易发生片面性的毛病，有时我们的宣传容易流于只讲空洞的大道理，而不能联系群众的个人利益和眼前的实际问题，有时又容易流于只着重群众眼前的个人利益，而忽略了关于国家利益和长远利益的宣传。这两种偏向都是不好的，而后一种偏向，在最近一个时期的农村宣传中表现得比较突出。例如，宣传粮食统购，就只会算粮食账，但忽略了关于粮食统购对保障国家工业化建设的重大意义的宣传解释；宣传棉布计划供应，就只会算棉布账，而不会解释棉布计划供应的根本道理。其他在棉花统购，互助合作宣传中，也都有类似的情形。这些情形是必须改善的。
    教育农民的前提是教育干部和党员。因为党和政府的重大政策和任务，都是要经过广大的干部去向农民宣传和领导农民来完成的。现在许多地方正在召开或正准备召开党的各级干部会议和党的代表会议。各级党的组织都应通过会议，抓紧对干部和党员进行思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，消除他们的思想顾虑，交代清楚工作方法，使他们继续坚持用教育说服的方法，去发动广大农民，胜利地完成农业社会主义改造的各项工作任务。
