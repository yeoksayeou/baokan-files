    Shanghai is actively carrying out industrial hygiene work. At present, most factories have dedicated or specially-contracted hospitals. Health clinics have been established in 523 large factories, and some even have hygiene departments and workshop health stations. In order to solve the medical treatment and healthcare problems of workers in more than 8,000 medium and small factories, 68 joint labor health stations have been established. The total number of doctors in various factories has reached more than 1,100, an increase of five times compared to the pre-liberation period. Many workers have received free medical care. A lot of work has also been done in the area of women workers' health. Currently, all state-owned textile factory female workers use the new method of delivery during childbirth, and more than 90% of female workers in private textile factories also use the new method. Most factories with a large number of female workers have established workshop women's health rooms and have carried out various health care activities. In addition, factories have also established 189 sanatoriums and rest homes for workers, with a total of more than 4,000 beds.
    Since June of this year, in order to systematically reduce common and occupational diseases in factories, the health and epidemic prevention stations in each district have begun to focus on implementing a health supervision system. Starting from the existing conditions of the factories, they are gradually improving food hygiene and cooling equipment, as well as preventing occupational poisoning and other phenomena. In addition to focusing on piloting a reporting system for five occupational diseases—lead, mercury, benzene, aniline, and asphalt—this year, the Municipal Health Bureau has also designated three hospitals to conduct clinical research on occupational diseases and poisoning. In order to strengthen the scientific determination and laboratory work of industrial hygiene, the Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station has established an industrial hygiene testing laboratory equipped with advanced scientific and technological equipment to regularly conduct industrial hygiene laboratory work. Many medical and health experts have participated in industrial hygiene investigation and research. With the development of industrial hygiene work, the health of Shanghai workers has improved, and workers' sick leave is gradually decreasing. For example, the rate of absenteeism due to illness in state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory has decreased by more than half this year compared to the same period last year. At the same time, most factories have also prevented the occurrence of occupational poisoning.

    上海市积极开展工厂卫生工作
    上海市工业卫生工作正在积极开展中。目前，各工厂大都有了专门或特约的医院。在五百二十三个大工厂中都建立了保健室，有的还设有卫生科、车间保健站等。为了解决八千多中、小工厂工人的治病、保健问题，先后建立了六十八个工厂联合劳工保健站。各工厂的医生总数已有一千一百多人，比解放前增加了五倍。许多工人都得到了免费医疗。在女工保健方面也做了很多工作。目前，国营纺织厂女工分娩时已全部用新法接生，私营纺织厂女工采用新法接生的也在百分之九十以上。在女工多的工厂，大部分设立了车间女工卫生室，并展开了多方面的保健工作。此外，各工厂还设有一百八十九个工人疗养所和休养所，共有四千多张床位。
    从今年六月份起，为了有计划地减少工厂中的多发病、职业病，各区的卫生防疫站开始重点推行卫生监督制。从工厂现有条件出发，逐步改善饮食卫生和降温设备，以及防止职业中毒等现象。市卫生局除在今年重点试行了铅、汞、苯、苯胺、沥青五种职业病的报告制度以外，还指定了三个医院，对职业病和中毒现象作临床研究。为了加强工业卫生的科学测定和化验工作，市卫生防疫站已设立了有先进科学技术设备的工业卫生检验室，经常进行工业卫生的化验工作。很多医学卫生专家都参加了工业卫生的调查研究工作。随着工业卫生工作的开展，上海工人的健康状况已有了改善，工人因病请假的正在逐渐减少。如国营上海第一棉纺织厂、国营上海第十九棉纺织厂等厂，今年比去年同期的因病缺勤率，已减少了一半多，同时，大多数工厂也都防止了职业中毒现象的发生。
