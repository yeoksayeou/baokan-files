Hubei Province's embankment closure and dyke restoration projects along the Yangtze River and lakes are proceeding intensely. By the end of October, over ten embankment closure projects, including Shangche Bay in Jianli, the People's Great Dyke in Shishou County, and Wuzhujiao in Qianjiang County, have been successfully completed. In Jingzhou Prefecture, which has the largest task of embankment closure and dyke restoration, 100,000 laborers are working on the dykes every day. In Xiaogan Prefecture, the counties of Hanchuan, Jiayu, and Yunmeng also have 60,000 laborers working on the dykes daily. Most of the breaches in the main and branch dykes and areas of intentional flood diversion throughout the province have been closed off. The materials needed for embankment closure and dyke restoration are being transported to various locations one after another. Construction will begin in full swing across all regions in mid-November.

Because this year's annual repairs involve large-scale projects and heavy tasks, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government determined the guiding principle of "embankment closure and dyke restoration, focusing on reinforcement" for the annual repair work as early as the disaster area work conference in September. Subsequently, they organized trade, cooperative, and transportation departments to serve the dyke repair work.

In order to combine production with disaster relief, all disaster victims in the severely affected areas will be employed on the embankment repairs through a work-for-relief program. The average wage earned by each disaster victim for dyke repair work can sustain not only their own living expenses but also the livelihood of one and a half to two other people. The total government investment in water conservancy projects is close to the sum of investments over the past four years.

After returning to their hometowns in the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province, disaster victims are universally engaged in rebuilding their homes and engaging in production for self-salvation under the leadership of local Party committees.

As disaster victims return to their homes, grain departments are continuously transferring large quantities of grain from all over the province to the disaster areas. Various locations have established more grain supply points and are issuing grain coupons to disaster victims in a timely manner, ensuring that they receive sufficient grain supplies. In order to solve the housing problems of disaster victims, the Provincial Timber Company has organized the transportation of large quantities of timber to the disaster areas. Local supply and marketing cooperatives and trade departments are also actively dealing in bamboo mats, reed mats, reed firewood, and other materials for building houses. In addition, leading agencies in various counties and districts are mobilizing disaster victims to collect local materials, such as cutting thatch for roofing. One district in Echeng County mobilized disaster victims to cut one million jin of thatch; disaster victims from Huangmei County who were relocated to Yangxin County each cut 1,500 jin of thatch, which the government organized ships to help transport, solving the housing problem. Disaster victims from Honghu County who were relocated to Zhongxiang County all brought back large quantities of reed mats. Various locations are providing subsidies averaging 180,000 to 200,000 yuan per household to disaster victims who are unable to repair their homes. By mid-November, the housing problems of most disaster victims had been largely resolved.

While helping disaster victims settle down, various locations are also actively leading the masses in draining water and carrying out winter planting. Tianbao Township in Huangpi County organizes more than 200 people daily, using more than 90 waterwheels to drain water, and has already rushed to plant more than 240 mu of crops. According to statistics in late October, the area of cultivated land that has been drained of water in the province has reached more than five million mu, of which one-third has been rushed to plant various crops.

Jiangsu, Henan, and non-disaster areas of Hubei Province have provided a total of more than 74 million jin of seeds such as wheat, broad beans, and field peas to the disaster areas, of which more than 90% have been transported to the disaster areas. The seed supply problem has been successfully resolved.

In order to strengthen the leadership of work in the disaster areas and promptly identify and solve problems, responsible cadres of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government are going deep into the disaster areas to inspect and assist in the work.

    湖北省沿江滨湖堵口复堤工程紧张进行
    积极帮助回乡灾民重建家园生产自救
    湖北省沿江滨湖各县堵口复堤工程正紧张进行。到十月底止，已有监利的上车湾、石首县的人民大垸、潜江县的五支角等十余处堵口工程胜利完工。堵口复堤工程任务最大的荆州专区每天有十万民工上堤，孝感专区的汉川、嘉鱼、云梦等县每天上堤民工也达六万人。全省各主要干、支堤溃口和主动分洪的地方，大部堵口断流。堵口复堤所需的器材，正陆续向各地调运。本月中旬，各地工程将全面开工。
    由于今年岁修的工程大，任务重，中共湖北省委和省人民政府早在九月份的灾区工作会议上即确定了“堵口复堤、重点加固”的岁修工作方针。接着组织了贸易、合作、交通部门为修堤工作服务。
    为了结合生产救灾，重灾区灾民修堤时将全部实行以工代赈，平均每一个灾民修堤所得的工资，除本人生活费用外，还可维持一个半人到两个人的生活。政府对水利工程投资总数，接近于四年来投资的总和。

    湖北省水灾地区灾民还乡后，在各地党委领导下，普遍进行重建家园和生产自救的活动。
    随着灾民还乡、粮食部门即从全省各地源源向灾区调运大批粮食。各地都增设粮食供应点，及时发给灾民粮票，使灾民及时得到足量的粮食供应。为了解决灾民的住房问题，省木材公司组织大批木材向灾区调运。各地供销合作社、贸易部门也积极经营子篾、芦席、芦柴等盖屋材料。此外，各县、区领导机关都发动灾民就地取材，砍割茅草作为盖屋之用。鄂城县一个区就发动灾民割茅草一百万斤；黄梅县转移在阳新县的灾民，每人都割了一千五百斤茅草，由政府组织船只帮助运输，解决了住屋问题；转移在锺祥县的洪湖县灾民，都带了大批芦席回去。各地对无力修补住屋的灾民，每户平均发给十八万到二十万元的补助费。到十一月中旬止，灾民的住屋问题已大部解决。
    在帮助灾民安家的同时，各地都积极领导群众，进行排水冬播。黄陂县天保乡每天组织二百余人用九十多乘水车排水，已抢种二百四十余亩农作物。十月下旬统计：全省已退出和排出渍水的耕地，已达五百余万亩，其中有三分之一的耕地抢种了各种农作物。
    江苏、河南及湖北省非灾区支援灾区的大、小麦、豌豆、蚕豆等种子共有七千四百余万斤，先后运到灾区的已达百分之九十以上。种子供应问题已顺利解决。
    为了加强灾区工作的领导，及时发现并解决问题，中共湖北省委和省人民政府的负责干部都深入灾区检查和帮助工作。　（本报湖北记者站）
