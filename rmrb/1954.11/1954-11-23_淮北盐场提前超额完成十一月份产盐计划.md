The staff and workers of the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field actively launched autumn sun-drying production. As of November 15th, the entire field had pre-fulfilled and over-fulfilled the November salt production plan by 159.99 percent, with a salt production volume more than eleven times that of the actual total production in November of last year.

In previous years, the Huaibei Salt Field had generally ceased or produced very little salt in November. This year, there was a lot of rain in the summer and autumn, and the salt production situation was not good. All employees responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, broke with convention, and actively engaged in production. This November, short sunshine hours, low evaporation, and low wind speed caused the windmills to turn slowly and made it difficult to pump water, bringing difficulties to production and causing serious drought beaches and niter grid phenomena. In order to adapt to the needs of crystallization and ensure the supply of brine, the entire field universally promoted the "single-line water diversion method" to accelerate the improvement of water quality. Li Qiaofang, an old worker from the Jin Siwei team of the Jixi Institute of the Guanxi Field, promoted the "single-line water diversion method," and the water quality increased by three degrees compared to the original double-line water diversion in one trip. After the Kaitai Institute of the Taipei Field implemented advanced working methods such as the "single-line water diversion method," it not only improved water quality and guaranteed crystallization needs, but also basically eliminated the old brine niter grid phenomenon. In order to solve the water shortage problem, the field organized water-pumping work, and workers' families also participated, and the number of irrigation ponds gradually increased. The cumulative crystallization pond utilization rate reached 46.34 percent. At present, all employees are seizing the last opportunity to strive for salt production and are actively carrying out beach repair and other winter production preparation work.

    淮北盐场提前超额完成十一月份产盐计划
    国营淮北盐场职工积极展开秋晒生产。截至十一月十五日止，全场以百分之一百五十九点九九提前超额完成了十一月份产盐计划，产盐量为去年十一月全月实际产量的十一倍多。
    往年十一月，淮北盐场已大体不产盐或产盐很少。今年夏秋多雨，盐产情况不好，全体职工响应增产节约号召，打破惯例，积极生产。今年十一月因为日照短，蒸发量小，风速小，风车转得慢，打不上水，给生产带来了困难，发生了严重的干旱滩和硝格现象。为了适应结晶需要，保证卤源供应，全场普遍推行了“单线走水法”，以加速提高水质。灌西场济西所晋四圩小组老工人李巧芳推行“单线走水法”，走水一趟就比原来双线走水水质提高三度。台北场开太所实行“单线走水法”等先进工作方法后，不仅提高了水质，保证了结晶需要，还基本上消灭了老卤硝格现象。为解决缺水问题，场内组织了打水的工作，工人家属也参加了，灌池数逐步增加。累计结晶池利用率达百分之四十六点三四。目前，全场职工正抓紧最后时机，争取产盐。并积极进行修滩和其他冬季生产准备工作。（本报江苏记者站）
