    The Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry
    Begins Investigation and Research Work on Traditional Chinese Medicine Production
    [This newspaper dispatch] To strengthen the leadership over the production of traditional Chinese medicine, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Section was recently established under the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, and investigation and research work on the production of traditional Chinese medicine has begun.
    According to the investigation by the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau, the most widely supplied and most demanded traditional Chinese medicines are pills, powders, plasters, medicinal powders, and medicinal wines. According to a survey of several well-known pharmacies across the country, the above-mentioned medicines account for more than 90% of the total output value of the medicines sold. Among the medicines supplied by more than 500 traditional Chinese medicine pharmacies in Beijing and Tianjin, pills, powders, plasters, medicinal powders, and medicinal wines account for about 60%. Most of these medicines are purchased and taken directly by patients, so they are widely used, and there is often a shortage of supply. In state-owned pharmaceutical factories, traditional Chinese medicine preparations account for only 10.9% of the total output value. For this reason, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau decided to start with investigation and research to strengthen the leadership of the production of traditional Chinese medicine, and to determine that the future focus should be on researching pills, powders, plasters, medicinal powders, and medicinal wines. The types of medicines to be manufactured will also be identified and selected from the prescriptions of the above-mentioned medicines first.
    Since the beginning of October, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau has sent working groups to Chengde in northeastern Rehe, Harbin, Shenyang, and other places to conduct focused investigations and study the existing problems in the production, sales, and supply of traditional Chinese medicine. In order to further improve the medical and economic value of crude drugs, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau will begin to extract crude drugs and improve the dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicine.

    轻工业部医药工业管理局
    着手进行关于中药生产的调查研究工作
    【本报讯】为加强对中药生产的领导，轻工业部医药工业管理局最近成立了中药科，着手进行关于中药生产的调查和研究工作。
    据医药工业管理局调查，目前供应面最广、需要量最多的中药是丸、散、膏、丹、药酒等几种药剂。据全国有名的几家药铺的调查，在销售的药品中，上述药剂占总产值的百分之九十以上。北京、天津五百多家中药铺所供应的药品，丸、散、膏、丹、药酒等药剂占百分之六十左右。这些药剂大多由病人直接购服，因此应用范围很广，常发生供应不足的现象。而在国营药厂中，中药制剂只占总产值的百分之十点九。为此，医药工业管理局决定先从调查研究着手，加强对中药生产工作的领导，确定今后以研究丸、散、膏、丹和药酒等药剂为主，制造品种也首先从上述药剂的处方中加以鉴别和选择。
    从十月初开始，医药工业管理局派工作组去东北热河、哈尔滨、沈阳等地，有重点地进行调查，研究目前中药在产销和供应方面存在的问题。为进一步提高生药的医疗和经济价值，医药工业管理局将着手进行提炼生药和改进中药剂型的工作。
