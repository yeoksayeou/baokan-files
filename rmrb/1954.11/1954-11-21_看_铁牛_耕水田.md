    Seeing "Iron Oxen" Cultivating Paddy Fields
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Luo Houren, Ma Zhongming
    On November 6th and 7th, the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station held a production demonstration meeting in Jiumu Township, Changsha County, to support the Jiumu Agricultural Production Cooperative. The weather was clear on both days, and the countryside felt like a festival. People heard that "iron oxen"—tractors—were plowing paddy fields, and farmers from within a radius of dozens of miles came to watch. Members of the Qiaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative in the neighboring township rang the bells at midnight to get up for a meal and arrived early in the morning.
    Around two o'clock in the afternoon, two "iron oxen" arrived. In addition, there were more than ten kinds of new agricultural implements, such as double-wheeled single-share plows, seeders, and harvesters. Hundreds and thousands of farmers and students beat gongs and drums and held red flags to welcome them from three miles away. They saw these things for the first time, both happy and doubtful. They were happy to see "socialism," but they doubted that the "iron oxen" were so heavy that they could only cultivate the dry land in the north and not the paddy fields in the south. Before long, the "iron oxen" began working in the fields amidst everyone's enthusiastic welcome. Originally, these two tractors had rubber tires, and they would sink into the mud as soon as they entered the paddy fields. Later, the workers converted them into iron wheels with single-character teeth, and they could travel and cultivate smoothly in the paddy fields. They saw a person sitting on it, driving it into the fields with a rumbling sound, and the muddy water rustling, and rows of mud were turned over. The "iron ox" could advance, retreat, turn corners, and be nimble in the paddy fields. In less than the time it took to smoke two pipes of tobacco, it had plowed more than one mu. Everyone stared at the "iron ox" in surprise. Eighty-year-old farmer Wu Guangtian didn't have good eyesight, but he insisted on squeezing into the crowd to see what was going on. He measured the depth with his hand and said, "It's more than six inches deep, smooth and slippery. The worker comrades are really capable. No cow in our village can plow this deep." Many young farmers, women, and students also went up and tried driving it twice, and they were even more overjoyed, asking this and that. The commentator told them, "This kind of small tractor can plow, harrow, and cultivate paddy fields. It can cultivate more than three mu in one hour. It is equipped with electric lights, so if you need to catch up with the season, you can also plow at night." How happy they were to hear this! One said, "In the future, we won't have to run behind the cow's ass anymore!" Another said, "We still have to work hard to improve production, socialism cannot be waited for."
    After the farmers watched the "iron ox" plowing the fields, they visited many other new agricultural implements. The members of the agricultural production cooperative were most interested in the threshing machine. The farmers from the mountainous area praised the hand-operated shredder. Most of the shredder is made of wood, which is economical and durable, and can shred more than 600 jin of sweet potatoes per hour, which is fifteen times faster than manual labor.
    The performance of the tractors and these new agricultural implements illuminated the eyes of the farmers like bright lamps. The farmers in the Sixteenth District of Changsha County have a quick verse: "The iron ox is really clever, plows deep, plows well; not afraid of heat, doesn't eat grass; to make socialism come early, machines are indispensable; to make socialism come early, supporting industrialization is most important." Now, the farmers in Changsha County are selling their surplus grain to the state one after another, and the trucks delivering grain are constantly on the road. Every evening, everyone in the village discusses it. Mutual aid groups hold meetings to discuss how to rectify the organization, improve production, and strive to transfer to the cooperative. Many individual farmers are also brewing mutual aid groups to purchase new agricultural implements jointly and resolutely take the road of socialism. Li Shaolin, a member of the Gaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative, had repeatedly wanted to withdraw from the cooperative because he was strong and had good labor. This time, after his wife, Li Shaoyuan, visited the new agricultural implement performance, she decided not to withdraw from the cooperative.

    看“铁牛”耕水田
    新华社记者　罗厚仁　马钟明
    十一月六日和七日，湖南省农业试验场在长沙县九木乡举行支援九木农业生产合作社生产表演大会。这两天，天气晴朗，乡村里像是节日一样。人们听说用“铁牛”——拖拉机犁水田，方圆几十里内的农民都跑来参观。邻乡礄里农业生产合作社的社员们半夜就敲钟起床吃饭，一清早赶到了。
    下午两点多钟的时候，两条“铁牛”来了。另外，还有双轮一铧犁、播种机和收割机等十多种新式农具。成百上千的农民和学生敲起锣鼓打着红旗到三里以外欢迎。他们第一次看见这东西，又喜又疑。喜的是看到了“社会主义”，疑的是“铁牛”身子这样笨重，恐怕只能耕北方的旱地，不能耕南方的水田。不一会，“铁牛”在大家热烈欢迎之下下田干活了。原来这两台拖拉机是橡皮轮子，一下水田就陷进泥里，后来工人把它改装成带一字齿的铁轮后，可以在水田里畅行耕作。只见一个人往上一坐，就轰隆隆地驾着向田里跑，泥水哗啦啦的响起来，一行行的泥巴就翻转了。“铁牛”在水田里可进可退，拐弯抹角，轻巧灵活，不到两袋烟工夫，就耕了一亩多。每个人都望着“铁牛”惊奇。八十岁老农民伍光田眼力不大好，硬要挤进人丛里去看个究竟，他用手测量了一下深度说：“足有六寸多，又平又滑，工人老大哥本领真大，我们乡下哪条牛能耕这样深。”许多青年农民、妇女和学生还上去试开了两趟，更喜得心花怒放，问这问那。讲解员告诉他们：“这种小型拖拉机可以在水田里犁田、耙田、耖田，一点钟能耕三亩多，上面装有电灯，如果要赶季节，晚上也可以犁。”他们听了是多么高兴啊！这个说：“将来我们不要再跟在牛屁股后面跑了！”那个说：“还是要努把力搞好生产才行，社会主义是等不来的。”
    农民看了“铁牛”耕田后，就参观其他许多新式农具。农业生产合作社的社员们对脱粒机最感兴趣。山区来的农民对手摇刨丝机赞赏不已。刨丝机大部分是木料做的，经济耐用，一小时能刨红薯六百多斤，比人力要快十五倍。
    拖拉机和这些新农具的表演，像明灯一样照亮了农民的眼睛。长沙县十六区农民有这样一首快板：“铁牛真正巧，犁得深，犁得好；不怕热，不吃草；要得社会主义早来到，机器真是少不了；要得社会主义早来到，支援工业化最重要”。现在，长沙县的农民纷纷把余粮卖给国家，每天送粮的车络绎于途。一到傍晚，各个屋场都议论起来。互助组开会讨论怎样整顿组织搞好生产争取转社，许多单干农民也在酝酿组织互助组合伙购买新农具，坚决走社会主义的道路。高山农业生产合作社社员李少林因人强劳力好，几次想退社，这次他爱人李少元来参观了新农具表演后，决心不退社了。
