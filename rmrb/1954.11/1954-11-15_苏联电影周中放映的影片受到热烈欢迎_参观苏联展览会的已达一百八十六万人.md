Xinhua News Agency: The "Soviet Film Week," held in 30 cities across China to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, has been warmly welcomed by people everywhere. According to incomplete statistics from 80 cinemas in the first group of 12 cities that started Film Week on the 7th—Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Kunming, and Urumqi—over the course of four to six days, more than 2,300 screenings were held, with an audience of over 2,420,000.

Every film screened during Film Week has been warmly received by audiences. After watching the film "Frontier Post in the Mountains," many military units, workers, engineers, teachers, and students held discussions, expressing their determination to learn from the example of the Soviet border guards. A comrade from a certain unit of the Public Security Forces of the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who traveled from a remote border post to Guangzhou to see "Frontier Post in the Mountains," said: Two months ago, on a dark night with a typhoon of force 12 or higher, Squad Leader Li Yongzhong of the third squad, in a certain border area, captured the Chiang bandit group leader of the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Guangdong Detachment" who was attempting to cross the border. He said: In the film, we see imperialist spies wearing boar-hide shoes, while we have caught bandits and special agents disguised as dogs crossing the border, as well as armed special agents airdropped from American-made planes using parachutes; this tells the soldiers stationed on the border line how vigilantly they must guard their motherland.

Soviet Film Week will also be held in cities such as Changchun and Lanzhou starting from the 15th.

[Xinhua News Agency, 14th] Although the North is already in early winter, people are still enthusiastically visiting the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction every day.

As of the 14th, 402 questions had been raised. In the Industrial Hall and next to the mining and road construction machinery, many engineers, technicians, and students often gather to listen to Soviet experts explain the performance, structure, and operating methods of various machine tools, mining equipment, railway equipment, and road construction machinery. The Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has organized technical personnel to visit the Soviet Exhibition four times. They asked Soviet experts for explanations on-site and held seminars in connection with their work. Pan Zuyou, an engineer at the bureau, had run to many libraries in the past to find an answer on whether the large axles of locomotives could use water and oil, but to no avail. This time, Soviet experts helped him answer this question. The engineers and technicians of the Machine Tool Manufacturing Group of the bureau listened to ten reports from Soviet experts in total, and everyone gained a further understanding of the structure, function, and operating procedures of automatic machine tools.

    苏联电影周中放映的影片受到热烈欢迎
    参观苏联展览会的已达一百八十六万人
    据新华社讯：为庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年而在我国三十个城市举行的“苏联电影周”，受到了各地人民的热烈欢迎。据从七日开始第一批举行电影周的北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、南京、武汉、广州、南宁、昆明、乌鲁木齐等十二个城市的四天至六天的不完全统计，在八十多家电影院共放映了两千三百多场，观众达二百四十二万多人次。
    在电影周中放映的每一部影片，都受到观众热烈欢迎。许多部队和工人、工程师、教员、学生在观看“山中防哨”影片后，都纷纷举行座谈会，表示要学习苏联边防军的榜样。中国人民解放军中南军区公安部队某部一位同志，从遥远的边防赶到广州看了“山中防哨”后说：两个月前的一个刮着十二级以上台风的黑夜，在边防某地三班长李永忠抓住了一个企图越境的所谓“反共救国军粤东支队”的蒋贼小组长。他说：影片中看到的是穿着野猪脚的帝国主义间谍，而我们却在边境上抓到了装着狗样越境的土匪特务以及从美制飞机用降落伞空降的武装特务；这就告诉我们驻守边防线上的战士们，要如何警惕地守卫着自己的祖国。
    自十五日起，在长春、兰州等城市也将举行苏联电影周。
    【新华社十四日讯】虽然北方已是初冬季节，但每天到苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会参观的人依然十分踊跃。到十一月十四日止，参观展览会的观众已达一百八十六万人。天津市、河北、陕西等省和内蒙古自治区的参观者仍继续大批前来参观。
    每天都有参观者走进展览会的经验交流接待室，把工厂或企业里存在的重大问题提给苏联专家，到十四日已提出四百零二个问题。在工业馆和矿山筑路机械旁边，经常围聚着许多工程师、技术工人和学生，听苏联专家讲解各种机床、矿山、铁道设备和筑路机械等机器的性能、构造及操作方法。铁道部机务总局已组织技术人员到苏联展览会参观了四次。他们在现场上请苏联专家讲解，并且联系工作举行了座谈会。该局工程师潘祖佑过去为了机车大轴能不能使用水油，跑了很多图书馆，得不到解答。这次苏联专家帮助他解答了这个问题。该局机床制造组的工程师和技术工人们一共听了苏联专家十次报告，大家对自动机床的构造、作用和操作规程都有了进一步了解。
