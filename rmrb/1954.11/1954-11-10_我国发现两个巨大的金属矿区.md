    Two Huge Metal Mining Areas Discovered in China

    [This newspaper] A certain work team of the Ministry of Geology has successively discovered two large-scale metal mining areas and many mineralized areas in a certain place this year, providing the country with new and important mineral resources.
    In order to meet the needs of national construction and continue to provide reserve resources, a certain work team of the Ministry of Geology expanded the geological survey around a certain mining area. Since the beginning of April, it has successively sent four geological survey teams to conduct surveys along the geotectonic zone where the existing mining area is located for hundreds of kilometers to find new mineral deposits. In the past six months, the survey teams have made great achievements. They first discovered a new mining area with the same type and scale as the existing mining area in the periphery of the mining area, and discovered rare ferrous metal mines in China. At the same time, they have successively discovered many promising mineralized areas, which are worth further supplementary investigation.
    In order to discover the underground treasures of the motherland, the survey team members have been trekking through the mountains and fields where people are rarely seen for many years, braving wind, frost, rain and snow. They often have to climb over high mountains and ridges several thousand meters above sea level, and wade through rivers that are as deep as their waists. Sometimes, they camped in cold valleys, huddled together back-to-back to keep warm, and lit campfires to prevent attacks from wild animals. The survey team that continues to work in a certain mountain is currently facing the threat of severe cold. It often snows there now, and the temperature drops to minus 15 to 20 degrees Celsius, and the stratum has been frozen. But they still insist on carrying out their work, and moved from the valley to the mountain peaks thousands of meters above sea level to shorten the distance between the station and the mine and improve work efficiency.
    The work of the survey team has been supported by the local people of all ethnic groups. People of all ethnic groups enthusiastically helped the survey team to lead the way, transport tents and equipment, presented their treasured "babies" that they have collected for many years, and pointed out the places where "strange stones" grow. One team discovered a very promising mineralized area because farmers gave them mineral specimens.

### 我国发现两个巨大的金属矿区

    我国发现两个巨大的金属矿区
    【本报讯】地质部某工作队今年陆续在某地发现了两个规模庞大的金属矿区和许多矿化地区，为国家找到了新的重要矿产资源。
    地质部某工作队为了满足国家建设的需要，继续提供后备资源，扩大了某矿区外围的地质普查，从四月初开始，相继派出了四个地质普查队，沿现有矿区所在的大地槽构造带，进行绵延数百公里的普查，以找寻新的矿产地。半年来，普查队员们已经作出了很大的成绩。他们在矿区外围首先发现了一个和现有矿区相同类型和规模的新矿区，并发现了目前国内稀有的黑色金属矿。同时，并陆续发现了许多有希望的矿化地区，这些地区都有着进一步补查的价值。
    普查队员们为了发掘祖国的地下宝藏，长年累月地冒着风霜雨雪跋涉在人迹罕到的山野。他们经常要翻过拔海数千公尺的高山峻岭，涉过深及腹部的河流。有时，他们露宿在寒冷的山谷中，背靠背地挤在一起取暖，烧起营火防范野兽的袭击。在某山中继续坚持工作的普查队，目前已遇到严寒的威胁，那里现在经常下雪，温度降低到零下十五度到二十度，地层已经封冻。但他们依然坚持着进行工作，并且由山谷内搬往拔海数千公尺的山头上居住，以缩短驻地与矿山的距离，提高工作效率。
    普查队的工作，受到了当地各族人民的支援。各族人民热情地帮助普查队带路，运输帐篷器材，把珍藏多年的“宝贝”献出来，指点生长着“怪石头”的地方。有一个队，就是由于农民送给他们矿石标本，发现了一个极有希望的矿化地区。
