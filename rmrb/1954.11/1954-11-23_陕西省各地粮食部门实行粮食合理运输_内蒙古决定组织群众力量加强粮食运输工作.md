    Shaanxi Province Grain Departments Implement Rational Grain Transportation
    Inner Mongolia Decides to Organize Mass Strength to Strengthen Grain Transportation Work
    Shaanxi Province grain departments at all levels implemented rational grain transportation, saving the state forty billion yuan in transportation costs from January to October this year.

    Since January this year, grain departments and transportation departments in various parts of Shaanxi have selected and adjusted ten transportation routes successively.  For grain transported from Xunyang and Baihe areas of Ankang Special District to Xi'an, the new route saved more than 580,000 yuan in freight per ton of grain this year.

    During the period of grain requisition and purchase and storage, grain departments in various parts of Shaanxi Province, based on the correct flow direction of grain over the years, concentrated a large amount of dispersed grain in towns and along transportation lines, facilitating the state's dispatching at any time.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to organize mass transportation forces to strengthen the transportation of grain and industrial products. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Autonomous Region People's Government convened a special transportation meeting in early November, arranging transportation work for November and December of this year and the first quarter of next year. In view of the current shortage of transportation capacity and the heavy transportation tasks, and the fact that winter transportation is an important part of the sideline production of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, it was decided to organize farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups to participate in branch line transportation with their ox carts, horse carts and other means of transportation, while state-owned transportation forces mainly undertake trunk line transportation. At present, 16,000 ox carts and horse carts from farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Yikezhao League will participate in transportation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    陕西省各地粮食部门实行粮食合理运输
    内蒙古决定组织群众力量加强粮食运输工作
    陕西省各地粮食部门实行粮食合理运输，今年一到十月份为国家节约运输费用四十亿元。
    今年一月以来，陕西各地粮食部门和运输部门先后选择和调整了十条运输路线。安康专区的洵阳、白河一带运往西安的粮食，今年改用新路线后，每吨粮食节省运费五十八万多元。
    在粮食征、购入库期间，陕西省各地粮食部门根据历年粮食正确的流转方向，把大批分散的粮食集中到城镇和交通沿线，便利国家随时调度。

    内蒙古自治区决定组织群众运输力量，加强粮食和工业品的运输工作。自治区人民政府财政经济委员会十一月上旬召开专门运输会议，安排了十一、十二两个月和明年第一季度的运输工作。根据当前运输力量不足，运输任务繁重，而冬季运输又是自治区各族农民副业生产的重要项目之一的情况，决定组织各族农、牧民的牛车、马车等交通工具参加分支线的运输，国营运输力量主要担负干线的运输。目前伊克昭盟各族农、牧民将有一万六千辆牛车、马车参加运输。　　　（新华社）
