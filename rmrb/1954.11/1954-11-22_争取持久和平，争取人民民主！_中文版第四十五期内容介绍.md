The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 45, 1954, has been published.

The central content of this issue is the celebration of the 37th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. This issue published an editorial entitled "The Banner of the Great October Socialist Revolution is Invincible!" The editorial pointed out that the Soviet people and all progressive humanity are solemnly celebrating the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The victory of the Great October Revolution is the victory of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution. On each anniversary of the October Revolution, all mankind sees more clearly the infinite creativity of the people who have seized power being brought into play in more aspects. This powerful creativity is brilliantly manifested in the tremendous labor achievements of the Soviet people, the builders of communism, and also in the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's material well-being. The great light of the October Revolution has shone all over the world. The principles proclaimed by the October Revolution have now become a huge force inspiring millions of working people to fight selflessly for freedom and happiness. The victory of the October Revolution was a turning point in human history, and a turning point in the world proletarian liberation movement and the national liberation movement of colonies and dependent countries. Under the influence of the October Revolution, communist parties were established in almost all countries of the world. These parties have creatively applied the incomparably rich experience of the Soviet Communist Party and have been tempered into powerful and invincible forces. The world-historic victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the victory of the working people in the people's democratic countries are a great victory for Marxism-Leninism. The communist and workers' parties in capitalist countries are the advocates and organizers of the national united front, and they are uniting the masses of the people in their countries to fight for peace, national independence, and democracy. The editorial concluded: The Great October Socialist Revolution has pointed out the path to happiness and prosperity for all mankind. More than 900 million people are advancing under the banner of the Great October, under the banner of freedom and progress, and under the banner of socialism and peace.
