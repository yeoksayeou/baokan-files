    The suburbs of Beijing have reaped a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, including over 85,000 mu of Chinese cabbage, oilseed rape, and radishes. Among them, 43,000 mu of Chinese cabbage have an average yield of over 10,000 jin per mu. The 97 mu of Chinese cabbage in the Yuanda Agricultural Production Cooperative of Dongran Village Township in Haidian District had an average yield of over 18,700 jin per mu. The Chinese cabbage in the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative of Fengtai District reached a high yield of over 21,300 jin per mu in some areas. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to sell all their vegetables to the state. According to statistics from over 130 agricultural production cooperatives, over 60 million jin of Chinese cabbage alone have been sold to supply and marketing cooperatives.
    In order to ensure a balanced supply of winter vegetables to Beijing, vegetable farmers in the suburbs and supply and marketing cooperatives are currently engaged in the storage of vegetables. It is estimated that over 200 million jin of Chinese cabbage have already been stored. If the stored spinach, radishes, scallions, as well as the successively supplied yangqi celery, greenhouse garlic sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes, and other fresh vegetables are added together, the average monthly vegetable supply from December this year to April next year can reach over 53 million jin.

    北京市郊区秋菜丰收
    北京市郊区八万五千多亩白菜、油菜、萝卜等秋菜丰收。其中四万三千亩白菜，平均每亩产量在一万斤以上。海淀区东冉村乡远大农业生产合作社的九十七亩白菜，每亩平均产量达一万八千七百多斤。丰台区黄土岗乡农业生产合作社的白菜，有的每亩达到二万一千三百多斤的高额产量。绝大部分农业生产合作社都和供销合作社订了合同，把全部蔬菜卖给国家。据一百三十多个农业生产社的统计，卖给供销合作社的白菜就有六千多万斤。
    为了保证对北京市的冬季蔬菜均衡供应，目前郊区种菜农民和供销合作社正在进行蔬菜的贮藏工作。据估计，贮藏的白菜已有二亿多斤。如果把贮藏的菠菜、萝卜、大葱以及陆续供应的阳畦芹菜、温室蒜黄、黄瓜、西红柿等鲜菜都加在一起，从今年十二月到明年四月，平均每月蔬菜上市量可达到五千三百多万斤。　　（新华社）
