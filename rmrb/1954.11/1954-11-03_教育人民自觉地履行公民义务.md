    Educating the people with a high degree of awareness and a positive attitude to fulfill the civic obligations stipulated in our country's constitution – abiding by the constitution and laws, observing labor discipline, maintaining public order, respecting social ethics, cherishing and protecting public property, paying taxes and performing military service in accordance with the law, and defending the motherland – is an important task that the Party and state organs must earnestly carry out after the promulgation of the constitution.

    This educational work is so important because any law and policy of our country can only be implemented and exert the most powerful force in guaranteeing and promoting the country's various undertakings when the broad masses of people truly recognize that it conforms to their own interests, and therefore consciously and strictly abide by and implement it, and actively fight against the few who are unwilling to abide by and unwilling to implement it. Any huge construction plan of the country can only be successfully completed and over-fulfilled when the broad masses of people believe that it is indeed closely linked to their own happiness, and therefore actively participate in it with the attitude of masters, and actively contribute their energy, wisdom, financial resources, and materials.

    The civic obligations of our country have a completely different meaning from the civic obligations of capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, all constitutions, laws, disciplines, and orders are all for maintaining the interests of a very small number of exploiters, maintaining the privileges of a very small number of exploiters, and their enslavement of the broad masses of working people. Our country is completely the opposite. We are a people's democratic country led by the working class. Our constitution, laws, and systems are all formulated by the people in order to suppress enemies, protect themselves, and build their own happy lives. They embody the will and interests of the people, embody the highest morality in human society, and embody the lofty ideals of many great figures in history who represented the people. The people strictly abide by and actively safeguard their own constitution, laws, and systems, and defend their motherland, which is to truly defend their own interests and future. The public property of our country, including the property collectively owned by the working people, is also not used as capital to squeeze and enslave the people, like the public property of capitalist countries (which is essentially still the property of capitalists), but is used to build a socialist society, guarantee the people's material and cultural life, and continuously develop and expand the people's welfare undertakings, and ensure that the people fully enjoy the civic rights stipulated in the constitution, such as the right to work, the right to rest, the right to education, etc. The faster public property develops, the faster the people's happiness grows, and the sooner the socialist society comes. Therefore, cherishing and protecting public property, strictly abiding by labor discipline, actively working, and paying taxes in accordance with the law to increase public property, is also protecting and creating the people's own happiness, and creating a material foundation for socialist society.

    That is to say, in our country, fulfilling civic obligations is completely unified with enjoying civic rights: to enjoy rights, one must fulfill obligations; fulfilling obligations will definitely lead to enjoying rights. The evil political system of capitalist countries, where exploiters enjoy various privileges without fulfilling obligations, and the masses of people are forced to bear all obligations without enjoying any rights, has been destroyed in our country. Precisely because of this, the people of our country can treat civic obligations with the positive attitude of masters.

    In the past five years, the people of our country have shown a high degree of consciousness and initiative in all aspects of abiding by laws and labor discipline, public order, protecting public property, actively working, and paying taxes in accordance with the law to increase public property; they have shown a high degree of self-sacrificing spirit and heroic spirit in the struggle to defend the motherland. People regard this positive attitude of being masters of the country when fulfilling civic obligations as a lofty morality, and regard the opposite attitude as a lack of morality. If someone violates the laws of the country, the masses of people will automatically rise up to report and expose them, as shown in the periods of "suppressing counter-revolutionaries," "land reform," "three-anti," and "five-anti." If someone violates labor discipline and public order, does not respect social ethics, does not cherish public property, is unwilling to pay taxes in accordance with the law, or shows cowardice and fear in defending the motherland, they will definitely be criticized and condemned by the broad masses of people. This revolutionary moral atmosphere also promotes people to regularly and consciously examine their own behavior, examine whether they have fulfilled the obligations that a citizen bears to the country and society, quickly overcome their shortcomings brought from the old era, correct their mistakes, and gradually develop themselves into new people with noble moral qualities.

    This process of change in the people's spiritual life and the construction process of a new moral atmosphere is currently developing and advancing among the people of our country with unprecedented scale and speed, along with the great socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

    But this does not mean that all the people of our country are now able to treat the country and civic obligations with a conscious master attitude. Today, there are still some people who show a not completely conscious attitude in fulfilling civic obligations, only willing to enjoy more rights, but unwilling to fulfill more obligations, and even use various methods to evade their obligations. The phenomenon of tax evasion and even disruption of the state's economic order exists quite commonly in private industrial and commercial enterprises; the phenomenon of violating labor discipline still exists quite seriously among some employees of state-owned enterprises; acts that hinder public order, violate public morality, damage public property, and other behaviors that do not abide by the constitution and laws often occur among government cadres and workers and peasants; the phenomenon of not being active in performing military service and defending the motherland, and only wanting others to contribute their efforts to protect themselves is also not an isolated one; in some cities and villages, criminal offenses such as theft, robbery, and rape of women that disrupt laws and order also occur. All of these are obstacles to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and carrying out socialist construction, and are obstacles to consolidating the people's vested interests and creating a happier life.

    Why are there still these phenomena? This is because:

    First, the general laboring masses have been enduring the reactionary rule of the exploiting class state in the old society, living in a position of being oppressed, enslaved, and having no human rights, living an extremely painful life; although it has been five years since liberation, some people still have the old views of the country to a certain extent, which makes them unable to fully and correctly understand some measures of the country, and they cannot correctly appreciate their new position in the country, and therefore hold a not completely positive attitude towards fulfilling civic obligations. Among them, there are also some people who are deeply influenced by the egoistic ideology of the exploiting class, so they always want others to fulfill more obligations, while they themselves enjoy more rights. They do not see how much damage this attitude will bring to the country, society, and their own long-term interests.

    Second, our country still has exploiting classes. Although they are not in a ruling position, their way of life and ideology of harming others and benefiting themselves cannot but continue to have a certain impact on the working people within a certain range. Some people in the exploiting classes often spread rumors and stir up troubles in order to promote the backward self-serving consciousness of some of the masses. Moreover, they directly use various methods to evade civic obligations, and use the democratic rights of citizens as a means of seeking illegal benefits, using a legal cloak to violate the laws and policies of the country, and some even attempt to disrupt the implementation of the country's economic construction plans.

    Third, the members of the feudal landlord class that has been eliminated still survive as individuals. Before most of them have been completely transformed, they cannot but be forced and reluctantly to abide by revolutionary laws and order and fulfill other civic obligations. Some stubborn and reactionary elements will also combine with the idlers and vagrants left over from the old society, act as a medium for the slanderous propaganda of imperialism, and directly disrupt the laws and order of the country. This is the social root cause of why various criminal activities cannot be eliminated to this day.

    However, because the vast majority of people in our country are patriotic and trust and support their government. Therefore, as long as arduous education is carried out, it will definitely be able to further eliminate the old views of the country and civic obligations that people brought from the old society. Stalin said: "The habits and customs, traditions and prejudices left over from the old society are the most dangerous enemies of socialism... Therefore, to fight against these traditions and habits, to overcome them in all aspects of our work, and finally, to cultivate the new generation in the proletarian socialist spirit - this is the most urgent task of our party. Without the realization of these tasks, the victory of socialism is impossible." (Stalin's Complete Works Volume VI - page 248) Fighting against the traditions and habits left over from the old society, changing people's ideology and consciousness, is in a sense a more arduous long-term struggle than overthrowing the reactionary political rule. But this is necessary for the victory of socialism, and we should not relax the effort just because it is a long-term task.

    With the promulgation of the constitution, we should universally strengthen civic education, so that every citizen can understand the nature and national system of our country, understand the unity of national interests and people's interests, the unity of civic rights and civic obligations, recognize their position as masters of the country, and further enhance their sense of solemn responsibility for the great motherland; at the same time, make every citizen understand that the old views of the country and civic obligations that they inherited from the old society have now become obstacles in their progress, and stumbling blocks to striving for greater happiness and striving for a socialist future, therefore, it is necessary to universally carry out self-criticism and self-education among the masses with a spirit of mutual assistance and mutual love to completely sweep away old ideas and throw away this ideological burden in the progress.

    For the classes that are about to be eliminated and the classes that have been eliminated, they should be told: the only way out is to honestly abide by the people's laws and order, and honestly fulfill their civic obligations. As long as they do this, they will all be able to live and work in peace and contentment, and be taken care of and protected by the country. If they do not do this, they will eventually be spurned by the people.

    The education of citizens must also be combined with refuting the enemy's deceptive propaganda. Our country's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings are advancing rapidly, our people's economic and cultural life are constantly improving and improving, and our citizens' various political rights and economic rights are constantly developing and expanding. We have countless facts to show the purely deceptive nature of the enemy's propaganda. We should widely publicize these facts to the people, explain the historical significance of these facts, and explain the future we are going to, that is, the socialist society, which is the inevitable trend of historical development, where a hundred times happier life is waiting for us. We must make the people truly understand these, so that the enemy's deceptive propaganda is completely shattered.

    The civic obligations clearly stipulated in the constitution are the civic obligations that all citizens of the People's Republic of China must earnestly fulfill. A considerably long period of struggle must be experienced here. This struggle includes the mandatory aspect of the law, but the more fundamental and more frequent aspect is to improve the people's awareness of patriotism and law-abiding through persuasion and education. The laws of our country represent the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people, that is, they fully conform to the interests of the masses of people. Its mandatory nature is based on the enthusiastic support and conscious observance of the vast majority of the masses of people. Therefore, the mandatory aspect of our laws is also based on persuasion and education, based on the common understanding of the necessity and fairness and reasonableness of this coercion by the majority of people, rather than abandoning persuasion and education and implementing simple coercion. However, resolute sanctions must be implemented in accordance with the law against those counter-revolutionary elements, reactionary class elements and rogue elements who deliberately provoke sabotage. The sanctions against these elements are also to protect and improve the patriotic and law-abiding consciousness of the broad masses of people.

### 教育人民自觉地履行公民义务

    教育人民自觉地履行公民义务
    教育人民群众以高度的自觉精神和积极态度来履行我国宪法所规定的公民义务——遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，尊重社会公德，爱护和保卫公共财产，依照法律纳税和服兵役，保卫祖国，这是宪法颁布以后党和国家机关必须切实进行的一项重要工作。
    这一教育工作所以重要，是因为我们国家的任何法律和政策，都只有在广大人民群众真正认识了是符合于自身利益，因而自觉地严格遵守和执行，并且积极地和那些不肯遵守和不肯执行的少数人进行斗争的时候，这些法律和政策才能贯彻实施，才能够在保障和促进国家的各方面事业中发挥最强大的力量。国家的任何巨大的建设计划，也只有在广大人民群众认为它确实和自身的幸福紧密相连，因而以主人翁的姿态积极参加，积极贡献自己的精力、智慧、财力和物力的时候，这些计划才有可能顺利完成和超额完成。
    我们国家的公民义务，和资本主义国家的公民义务有着完全不同的意义。在资本主义国家，所有的宪法、法律、纪律和秩序，统统为了维护极少数剥削者的利益，维护极少数剥削者的特权和他们对广大劳动群众的奴役。我们的国家则完全相反。我们是工人阶级领导的人民民主国家。我们的宪法、法律和制度，都是人民为了镇压敌人、保护自己、建设自己的幸福生活而制定的。它们体现着人民的意志和人民的利益，体现着人类社会中最高尚的道德，体现着历史上代表人民的许多伟大人物的崇高理想。人民严格地遵守和主动地维护自己的宪法、法律和制度，保卫自己的祖国，就是真正保卫自身的利益和前途。我们国家的公共财产，包括劳动人民集体所有的财产在内，也不是像资本主义国家的公共财产（实质上仍是资本家的财产）那样，被用作压榨人民、奴役人民的资本，而是被用来建设社会主义社会，保障人民的物质生活和文化生活，并且不断地发展和扩充人民的福利事业，保证人民充分享受宪法所规定的公民权利，如劳动权、休息权、受教育权，等等。公共财产发展得愈快，人民的幸福也增长得愈快，社会主义社会也就来得愈早。因此，爱护和保卫公共财产，严格遵守劳动纪律、积极劳动、依法纳税以增加公共财产，也就是保护和创造人民自己的幸福，为社会主义社会创造物质的基础。
    这就是说，在我们国家，履行公民义务是和享受公民权利完全统一的：要享权利，就必须尽义务；尽了义务，也就一定能享权利。资本主义国家那种剥削者享有各种特权而不尽义务，人民群众被迫担负一切义务而毫无权利可享的罪恶的政治制度，在我国已经被摧毁了。正因为这样，我国人民就能够用主人翁的积极态度来对待公民的义务。
    五年来，我国人民在遵守法律和劳动纪律、公共秩序、保卫公共财产、积极劳动、依法纳税以增加公共财产等各方面，都已经表现出高度的自觉性和自动性；在保卫祖国的斗争中更表现了高度的自我牺牲精神和英雄气概。人们把履行公民义务时的这种国家主人翁的积极态度当作崇高的道德，而把相反的态度当作缺乏道德的表现。如果有人违犯国家的法律，人民群众就会自动起来检举揭发，像“镇压反革命”、“土地改革”、“三反”、“五反”等时期所表现的那样。如果有人违反了劳动纪律和公共秩序，不尊重社会公德，不爱护公共财产，不愿意依法纳税，或者在保卫祖国中表示怯懦畏缩，他们就一定会受到广大人民群众的批评指责。这种革命的道德风气，同时，也推动人们经常自觉地检查自己的行为，检查自己是否履行了一个公民对于国家社会所担负的义务，迅速地克服着自己从旧时代带来的缺点，改正自己的过错，使自己逐渐地发展成为具有崇高道德品质的新人。
    这种人民精神生活的变革过程和新的道德风气的建设过程，目前正在伴随着伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，以史无前例的规模和速度在我国人民中发展着，前进着。
    但这决不是说，我国所有的人民现在都已经能够用自觉的主人翁的态度来对待国家和对待公民义务了。今天还有一部分的人在履行公民义务上表现出不完全自觉的态度，只愿意多享权利，而不愿意多尽义务，甚至用各种方法来逃避自己的义务。偷漏国税甚至破坏国家经济秩序的现象，在私营工商业中相当普遍地存在着；违反劳动纪律的现象在国营企业的一部分职工中还相当严重地存在着；妨害公共秩序、违反公共道德、损害公共财产以及其他各种不遵守宪法和法律的行为，在机关干部中和工农群众中也往往发生；对服兵役和保卫祖国不积极、光想叫别人出力来保护自己的现象也还不是个别的；在有些城市和乡村，还发生着偷窃、抢劫、强奸妇女等破坏法律和秩序的刑事犯罪现象。所有这些，都是巩固人民民主专政和进行社会主义建设的障碍，都是巩固人民既得利益和创造更幸福的生活的障碍。
    为什么还有这些现象呢？这是因为：
    第一、一般劳动群众在旧社会中一直忍受着剥削阶级国家的反动统治，处在被压迫、被奴役、毫无人权的地位，过着极端痛苦的生活；虽然解放五年了，但是一部分人民群众对于国家的旧的看法还在一定程度上存在着，这就使他们对国家的某些措施不能完全正确地理解，对自己在国家中所处的新地位还不能正确地体会，因而对履行公民义务也抱着不完全积极的态度。其中也有一些人因为受剥削阶级利己主义思想的影响较深，所以总是想让别人多尽义务，而自己则多享权利。他们看不到自己这种态度会给国家社会和自己的长远利益带来多少损害。
    第二、我们国家还有剥削阶级，他们虽然不是处在统治的地位，但是他们那种损人利己的生活方式和思想意识不能不继续在一定范围内对劳动人民发生一定的影响。剥削阶级中的一部分人，还常常散布谣言，拨弄是非，以助长部分群众自私自利的落后意识。而且他们还直接用各种方法逃避公民义务，并利用公民的民主权利当作谋取非法利益的手段，利用合法的外衣来违犯国家的法律和政策，甚至有的还企图破坏国家经济建设计划的实施。
    第三、已被消灭的封建地主阶级的成员还以个人的资格生存着。他们中间的大部分人在没有得到彻底的改造以前，对于遵守革命的法律、秩序和履行其他公民义务不能不是被迫的，不得已的。其中一部分顽固反动的分子，还会和旧社会遗留下来的不务正业、不事生产的流氓分子结合起来，为帝国主义的诽谤宣传做媒介，并直接破坏国家的法律和秩序。这就是各种刑事犯罪活动至今不能消灭的社会根源。
    但是，因为我国最大多数人民是爱国的，是信任和支持自己的政府的。因此，只要进行艰苦的教育就一定能够进一步清除人们从旧社会带来的对于国家和对于公民义务的旧看法。斯大林说过：“由旧社会遗留下来的习性和习惯，传统和偏见，是社会主义的最危险敌人……所以，同这些传统和习性作斗争，在我们工作的一切方面把它们克服，最后，培养新生一代以无产阶级社会主义精神，——这是我党最迫切的任务。不实现这些任务，社会主义胜利是不可能的。”（斯大林全集第六卷—二四八页）和旧社会遗留的传统和习惯作斗争，改变人们的思想意识，在某种意义上说是比推翻反动的政治统治更加艰苦的长期斗争。但这是社会主义的胜利所必需，不应该因为它是长期任务而放松进行。
    随着宪法的颁布，我们应该普遍加强公民教育，使每一个公民都能了解我们国家的性质和国家制度，了解国家利益和人民利益的统一性，公民权利和公民义务的统一性，认识自己的国家主人翁地位，进一步提高自己对于伟大祖国的庄严责任感；同时使每一个公民都了解，他们从旧社会因袭下来的那种对于国家和对于公民义务的旧看法，现在已经成为他们前进中的障碍，成为争取自己更大幸福和争取社会主义前途的绊脚石，因此必须以互助互爱的精神普遍展开群众中的自我批评和自我教育，来彻底扫除旧思想，扔掉前进中的这种思想包袱。
    对于将要被消灭的阶级和已经被消灭的阶级，应该告诉他们：唯一的出路就是老老实实遵守人民的法律和秩序，老老实实履行自己的公民义务。只要他们这样作了，他们就都能够安居乐业，并且受到国家的照顾和法律的保护。如果他们不这样作，他们就会最后遭到人民的唾弃。
    对于公民的教育，还必须和反驳敌人的欺骗宣传结合起来。我国的工农业生产和各方面的建设事业正在飞速前进，我国人民的经济生活和文化生活正在不断地改善和提高，我国公民的各种政治权利和经济权利正在不断地发展和扩充，我们有无数的事实可以说明敌人宣传的纯粹欺骗性质，我们应该向人民广泛宣传这些事实，说明这些事实的历史意义，说明我们将要奔赴的前途，即社会主义社会，乃是历史发展的必然趋势，那儿有更加幸福百倍的生活在迎接着我们。我们要使人民切实了解了这些，使敌人的欺骗宣传彻底被粉碎。
    宪法明文规定了的公民义务，是中华人民共和国所有的公民都必须认真履行的。这里必须经历一个相当长时期的斗争过程。这种斗争包括法律的强制性的一方面，但更基本的和更经常的一方面还是通过说服教育的方式以提高人民群众爱国守法的自觉性。我们的国家的法律，是代表最大多数人民的最大利益的，即完全符合人民群众的利益的，它的强制性是以最大多数人民群众的热烈拥护和自觉遵守为基础的。所以我们的法律的强制性的一面，也是建立在说服教育的基础上，基于大多数人对于这种强制的必要性和公平合理性的共同认识，而不是放弃说服教育工作，实行单纯的强制。但是，对于那些故意进行挑拨破坏的反革命分子、反动阶级分子和流氓分子，则必须依法实行坚决的制裁。对这些分子的制裁，也是为了保护和提高广大人民群众爱国守法的自觉性。
