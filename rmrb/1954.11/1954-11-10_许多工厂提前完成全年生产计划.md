    Many Factories Complete Annual Production Plans Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper] Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint Stock Company, and Baoji Textile Supplies Factory have all completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has completed its total annual production value plan ahead of schedule. The state-owned Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Factory has completed its annual electric motor production plan ahead of schedule.
    In order to strive for the early completion of the annual national production plan, employees of many factories have launched technical innovation movements and labor competitions. Employees of the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint Stock Company proposed many rationalization proposals and improved operating methods during the labor competition. From January to October, employees of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory put forward a total of 292 rationalization proposals, of which 116 have been adopted and implemented, increasing work efficiency by half to ten times. The Baoji Textile Supplies Factory focused on improving quality as a key issue and made many technical improvements. Employees of the Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Factory actively carried out technical innovations and promoted advanced Soviet experience such as high-speed cutting and the Kolesov lathe tool method.
    Some factories pay close attention to reducing costs and saving raw materials. The cost of steel pipes at the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant has been reduced by an average of more than 22 percent per quarter compared with the national plan. According to the state regulations, 1.333 tons of tube billet are required to roll one ton of seamless steel pipe, but now only 1.120 tons are needed. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory has further proposed to increase production and save 13.5 billion yuan for the state by the end of the year.

    许多工厂提前完成全年生产计划
    【本报讯】鞍钢无缝钢管厂、沈阳水泵厂、中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司和宝鸡纺织用品厂都提前完成了全年生产计划。北京农业机械厂提前完成了全年的生产总值计划。国营湘潭电机厂提前完成了全年的电动机生产计划。
    许多工厂职工为争取提前完成全年国家生产计划，曾开展了技术革新运动和劳动竞赛。中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司职工，在劳动竞赛中提出许多合理化建议，改进了操作方法。北京农业机械厂职工，从一月份到十月份共提出合理化建议二百九十二件，其中已采纳实现一百一十六件，提高工作效率半倍到十倍。宝鸡纺织用品厂抓住提高质量这一关键问题，作了许多技术改进。湘潭电机厂职工积极进行技术革新，推广高速切削、科列索夫车刀法等苏联先进经验。
    有些工厂很注意降低成本，节约原材料。鞍钢无缝钢管厂的钢管成本每季度平均比国家计划降低了百分之二十二以上。国家规定轧一吨无缝钢管需用一点三三三吨管坯，现在只需要一点一二零吨就够了。沈阳水泵厂已进一步提出到年底再为国家增产节约一百三十五亿元。
