Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 12th entitled "The Vietnamese People and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are Willing to Establish Relations with France on the Basis of Equality and Mutual Benefit."

The editorial said: As early as when the Geneva Conference had just begun, the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam clearly stated its policy towards France, which was to establish friendly relations between the two countries. Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong also mentioned this issue in his letter to French Prime Minister Mendès-France after the signing of the armistice agreement. President Ho Chi Minh further clarified this issue when answering questions raised by Agence France-Presse reporter Ullmann on November 9th.

The editorial said that the establishment of friendly relations between Vietnam and France is entirely in line with the wishes of the people of both countries. The Mendès-France government and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed the armistice agreement and recognized Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Therefore, the issue of establishing friendly relations between the two countries can and should be brought up for resolution.

The editorial said that the development of the international situation in the past few months has further proved that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully. If both sides have a sincere desire, Vietnam and France have many favorable conditions to establish and develop relations between the two countries.

The editorial pointed out that the implementation of the armistice agreement in the past few months and the policies adopted by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards French nationals and French economic and cultural interests in Vietnam fully demonstrate that the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are sincere and striving to create favorable conditions for the establishment of friendly relations between Vietnam and France.

The editorial then pointed out that the French side has implemented some of the agreement clauses to a certain extent, but it has also committed many serious acts that violate the armistice agreement. For example, the French government signed the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty; the French government is currently condoning colonialists to undermine the armistice agreement, and condoning the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to take inhumane retaliatory measures against Vietnamese people in South Vietnam who participated in the war of resistance; it has abolished the democratic rights of the South Vietnamese people, and continues to force some civilians in the north to withdraw to the south, etc. These activities greatly hinder the implementation of the armistice agreement. These activities are detrimental to France, beneficial to the American imperialists, and will only undermine the friendly relations between Vietnam and France.

The editorial finally pointed out: In order to establish good relations between the two countries in accordance with the wishes of the Vietnamese and French peoples, the French government should immediately abandon its policy of using the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, order an immediate stop to the terrorist acts against the South Vietnamese people, stop forcing Catholics to withdraw to the south, faithfully implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement, and consider the issue of establishing economic and cultural relations between Vietnam and France on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Only in this way will more favorable conditions be created for establishing trust and friendly relations between the two countries, and only in this way will France's interests in Indochina be guaranteed.

    越“人民报”评越法两国建立友好关系问题
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社河内讯：越南“人民报”十二日发表了题为“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府愿意在平等互利的基础上和法国建立关系”的社论。
    社论说：还在日内瓦会议刚刚开始的时候，越南民主共和国政府代表团就清楚地阐明了它对法国的政策就是在两国之间建立友好关系。范文同副总理在停战协定签字以后写给法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯的信中也曾提起这个问题。胡志明主席在十一月九日回答法新社记者乌尔曼所提出的问题时，更清楚地阐明了这个问题。
    社论说，越南和法国之间建立友好关系是完全符合于两国人民的愿望的。孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府和越南民主共和国政府签订了停战协定，并且承认了越南的独立、主权和领土完整。因此，两国建立友好关系的问题可能而且应该提出来加以解决。
    社论说，过去几个月的国际局势的发展进一步证明了有着不同政治制度的国家是可以和平共处的。如果双方都有真诚的愿望的话，越南和法国是有很多有利条件来建立和发展两国之间的关系的。
    社论指出：过去几个月来停战协定的执行和越南民主共和国政府对在越南的法国侨民以及法国的经济和文化利益所采取的政策，充分证明了越南民主共和国人民和政府有诚意并且努力为越南和法国之间建立友好关系而创造有利的条件。
    社论接着指出，法国方面在一定程度上执行了一些协议条款，但它也犯了许多严重破坏停战协定的行为。例如，法国政府签订了侵略性的东南亚条约；法国政府目前正在纵容殖民主义分子破坏停战协定，纵容吴庭艳集团对在南越的参加过抗战的越南人采取惨无人道的报复手段；它废除了南越人民的民主权利，继续强迫北部的若干平民撤到南部去等等。这些活动大大地阻碍了停战协定的执行。这些活动对法国不利，对美帝国主义者有利，并且只会破坏越、法两国之间的友好关系。
    社论最后指出：为了依照越法两国人民的愿望建立两国之间的良好关系，法国政府应当立即放弃它利用吴庭艳集团的政策，下令立即制止对南越人民的恐怖行为，停止强迫天主教徒撤到南部，忠实执行停战协定的一切规定，并考虑在平等互利的原则下建立越南和法国之间的经济和文化关系的问题。只有这样，才会产生更加有利的条件来建立两国之间的信任和友好的关系，只有这样，法国在印度支那的利益才会有保障。
