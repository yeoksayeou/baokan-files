　　Suggestions for Improving the Transportation of Dangerous Goods
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Mingchang of the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the China Pharmaceutical Company has put forward some useful suggestions on how to overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the railway department's transportation of dangerous goods. The Ministry of Railways has seriously handled Comrade Zhang Mingchang's suggestions, sent special personnel to investigate and study this issue, and has begun to solve it. This practice of valuing the opinions of the masses is correct. Now we publish Comrade Zhang Mingchang's letter of suggestion and the reply letter from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways together:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Comrade Zhang Mingchang's Letter of Suggestion
　　Zhang Mingchang of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Pharmaceutical Company writes: In March 1951, the Ministry of Railways promulgated the "Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods," which stipulated the types of dangerous goods and packaging requirements. This is beneficial to ensuring the safety of railway transportation and the interests of consigning units. However, this regulation has many shortcomings: some items that should be in the scope of dangerous goods are not specified in the regulations; some items that are not dangerous goods are listed in the transportation regulations for dangerous goods. For example, sodium sulfate was originally a mild laxative for internal use, but it is defined as a corrosive cargo; the packaging requirements for some dangerous goods in the regulations are divorced from reality, and domestic production units simply cannot meet them. In addition, medicines for medical use and chemical analysis and testing are different from chemical raw materials used in industry. Their quality is higher, generally packaged in small quantities, and the packaging materials are more sophisticated, making them less dangerous; however, the regulations make the same requirements without distinction, which makes the work of our pharmaceutical supply units even more difficult.

　　Taking some of the situations our unit has encountered in consigning medicines to stations under the Shanghai Transportation Branch Bureau of the Shanghai Railway Administration as an example: the picric acid we handle is of chemical purity grade, contains crystal water, and is not very dangerous during transportation, and the quantity required by each user is also very small. However, the Shanghai Transportation Branch Bureau often refuses to transport it, or calculates the freight at the price of a whole car regardless of the amount of goods. The pure nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid that we handle are all packaged in small quantities, using neutral ground-glass stoppered glass bottles as containers, and then sealed tightly with rubber sleeves and white wax, which can already ensure safety, but the Shanghai Transportation Branch Bureau often returns the consigned goods on the grounds that the packaging is not good enough.

　　In addition, some personnel of the Shanghai Transportation Branch Bureau are not familiar with the business of dangerous goods, but they arbitrarily increase the types of dangerous goods and put forward excessively high packaging requirements. For example, some cadres believe that all medicines with the word "acid" in their names are dangerous goods, and zinc sulfate, a raw material for preparing eye drops, is also regarded as a toxic cargo. For example, some time ago, we consigned a batch of 0.5% 666 powder produced by the Shanghai Plant Protection and Agricultural Machinery Factory, the packaging met the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Railways, but it was rejected by the receiving comrades at the station. There is also such an unreasonable phenomenon: some imported materials are transported across the ocean from foreign countries to our seaports, and then transported by train to Shanghai without any problems; but when they are to be transported from Shanghai to various places, they are considered to have packaging that does not meet the requirements and are refused transportation.

　　The Ministry of Railways has promulgated the "Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods" for more than three years, and has never collected opinions from all parties to revise it. I suggest that they quickly send special personnel, together with relevant units, to investigate this issue, and revise practical regulations that can both ensure transportation safety and facilitate the work of consigning units. Before the regulations are revised, some temporary measures should be formulated to solve the existing problems. Railway departments in various localities should also specially equip some technical personnel to master the transportation of dangerous goods, or actively organize on-site work cadres to study this knowledge.

　　Reply from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
　　At present, there are indeed many problems in the railway's transportation of dangerous goods, especially the chaotic situation in the Shanghai area is more serious. The main reason is that the "Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods" promulgated by the Ministry of Railways cannot fully meet the needs of the current situation: many dangerous goods have not been included, making it impossible for the front line to know what to do in their work; regarding packaging specifications, some are relatively general, some are divorced from reality, and at the same time, there is a lack of clear transportation conditions, so that the handling is not uniform in various places. We lack sensitivity to new things and have not promptly supplemented and revised the "Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods" according to the actual situation, so that the chaotic phenomenon in the work has existed for a long time, bringing many difficulties to the work of various consigning departments, which is what we should examine.

　　In order to fundamentally solve the existing problems, the Ministry of Railways sent a working group to Shanghai in mid-July to understand the situation, and formulated the measures for the transportation of imported dangerous goods, the measures for the transportation of chemical reagents and medicines, and the measures for the special acceptance of the transportation of dangerous goods that have not been listed in the "Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods" or whose packaging does not conform to the regulations, and also made preliminary revisions to the packaging requirements that do not conform to the actual possibilities. This working group jointly organized a technical research group with relevant agencies in Shanghai to study the types of dangerous goods, packaging requirements, and mixed loading conditions that should be included in the regulations. After returning to Beijing, a temporary regulation on the transportation of dangerous goods has been drafted, which will be promulgated and implemented after final review. In addition, we will organize the study of on-site staff with the assistance of relevant agencies to familiarize them with business knowledge and do a good job in the transportation of dangerous goods.

### 建议改进危险品的运输工作

专栏：

　　建议改进危险品的运输工作
    编者按：中国医药公司上海采购站张鸣昌同志对如何克服铁路部门在危险品运输工作中的混乱现象，提出了一些有益的建议。铁道部认真地处理了张鸣昌的建议，派出专人对这个问题进行调查研究，并已着手加以解决。这种重视群众意见的做法是正确的。现在我们把张鸣昌同志的建议信和铁道部商务局的答复信一并发表于后：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    张鸣昌同志的建议信
    中国医药公司上海采购供应站张鸣昌来信：一九五一年三月铁道部公布了铁路运输“危险品运送须知”的章则，规定了危险品的品种和包装要求。这对保证铁路运输的安全和托运单位的利益是有好处的。但是，这个章则有着不少缺点：有些应该属于危险品范围的物品，章则中没有规定；有些不是危险品，却被列为危险品的运输章则中。如硫酸钠原是一种内服的轻泻剂，即规定为腐蚀性货物；章则中对某些危险品的包装要求脱离实际，目前国内生产单位根本无法做到。此外，医药用和化学分析检验用的药品同工业中使用的化工原料不同，其品质较高，一般都是小量包装，包装材料比较精细，危险性已很小；而章则中却不加区别地提出了一样的要求，这更使我们药品供应单位的工作增加了不少困难。
    拿我们单位向上海铁路管理局上海运输分局所属车站托运药品工作中所遇到的一些情况作例子：我们经营的苦味酸是化学纯粹规格的，内含结晶水，运输中没什么危险，各使用单位所需的数量也很少。但是上海运输分局经常拒运，或者不论货物多少都按整车计算运价。我们经营的纯粹的硝酸、盐酸和硫酸，都是小量装，用中性的磨砂口玻璃瓶作容器，再用胶套及白蜡严封，已经可以保证安全，但是上海运输分局经常以包装不好为理由退回托运货物。
    此外，上海运输分局某些人员对危险品业务并不熟悉，却在那里随意增加危险品品种，提出过高的包装要求。如有些干部认为凡名称中有“酸”字的药品都是危险品，硫酸锌这种配制眼药水的原料也被看作了毒性货物。又如前些时候我们托运一批上海病虫药械厂出品的千分之五的六六六粉，包装符合农业部和铁道部的规定，却被车站收货同志退运。还有这样一种不合理的现象：某些进口物资远涉重洋从国外运到我国海口，再用火车运到上海，都没发生问题；但是要从上海运到各地时，却被认为包装不合要求而拒运了。
    铁道部公布“危险品运送须知”这个章则已经三年多，从来没有搜集各方面的意见来加以修正。我建议他们迅速派出专人，会同有关单位调查这方面的问题，修订既能保证运输安全、又能利于托运单位工作的切实可行的章则。在章则没有修订以前，应规定一些临时办法解决目前存在的问题。各地铁路部门还应该专门配备一些技术人员来掌握危险品运输工作，或者积极组织现场工作干部学习这方面的知识。
    铁道部商务局的答复
    目前铁路在运送危险品工作中确实存在着很多问题，特别是上海地区混乱情况更为严重。其主要原因是铁道部公布的“危险品运送须知”不能完全适合目前情况的需要：很多危险品未能列入，使现场在工作上无所适从；关于包装规格，有的比较笼统，有的脱离实际，同时并缺乏明确的运送条件，以致各地在办理时不统一。我们对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，没有根据实际情况及时将“危险品运送须知”增补修正，以致工作中混乱现象长期存在，给各托运部门的工作带来很多困难，这是我们应当检讨的。
    为了从根本上解决目前存在的问题，七月中旬铁道部派出工作组到上海去了解情况，拟定了进口危险品运送办法、化学试剂和药剂的运送办法，以及在“危险品运送须知”中未经列载的或与规定包装不符的危险品特别承认运送办法等，同时对不符合于实际可能的包装要求也作了初步的修正。这个工作组在上海和各有关机关共同组织了技术研究小组，研究了应列在规定内的危险品品种、包装要求以及混装条件等。回京后已拟订了危险品运送暂行规则，待最后审核后即可公布施行。此外，我们将在各有关机关的协助下，组织现场工作人员的学习，使他们熟悉业务知识，做好危险品运送工作。
