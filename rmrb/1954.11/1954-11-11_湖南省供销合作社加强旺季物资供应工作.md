Hunan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Strengthen Peak Season Goods Supply Work

    In coordination with the unified grain purchase work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are continuing to actively organize sources of goods, expand inventories, and strengthen the supply of materials to rural areas.

    Beginning in October, supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Hunan Province paid attention to reversing the attitude of some cadres who did not sufficiently value the peak season goods supply work, and strengthened the reserve and supply of goods for the peak season. In early October, grassroots cooperatives in various regions increased their inventories by nearly 4 billion yuan. The Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Linxiang County originally had an inventory of only over 600 million yuan, but recently added goods such as edible salt, sugar, cloth, and kerosene worth a total of 400 million yuan. The Eighth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ningxiang County, after clearing warehouses and conducting inventories, found that inventories were insufficient. It immediately sent cadres to state-owned companies to purchase large quantities of cloth and general merchandise. It also convened a meeting of handicraft industry representatives in the district on October 15 to increase order quantities. In addition, it signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives in neighboring districts, entrusting them with the processing of iron pots and other items. In early October, the Changsha County Supply and Marketing Cooperative accepted goods requisition plans from ten state-owned specialized companies in Changsha City and strengthened the organization of local handicraft sources such as earthen porcelain, umbrellas, and homespun cloth. In addition to replenishing the inventory of various major materials and expanding the variety of general merchandise, the Fourteenth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lianyuan County successively transferred various materials to various retail outlets. It also added two mobile supply teams to make it convenient for farmers to buy what they need after selling grain. In order to supply the materials they had already obtained to the farmers in a timely manner, the Eighth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ningxiang County, in addition to vigorously supplying goods in the original seven supply and marketing stores, also organized five peddlers to deliver goods to grain purchasing points to supply to farmers.

    湖南省供销合作社加强旺季物资供应工作
    湖南省各地供销合作社配合粮食统购工作，继续积极组织货源，扩大库存，加强对农村的物资供应。
    从十月份开始，湖南省许多地区的供销合作社注意扭转了部分干部对旺季物资供应工作重视不够的情绪，加强了旺季物资的储备和供应工作。各地基层合作社在十月上旬就增加了近四十亿元的库存。临湘县第四区供销合作社原来只有六亿多元的库存，最近增加的食盐、食糖、布匹、煤油等货物共值四亿元。宁乡县第八区供销合作社通过清仓排队，发现库存不足，便立刻派干部向国营公司采购了大批布匹、百货，并在十月十五日召开全区手工业代表会议，增加了订货数量，另外还同邻区供销合作社签订合同，委托它们加工铁锅等物品。长沙县供销合作总社在十月上旬同长沙市十个国营专业公司卸接了要货计划，并加强了对当地土瓷、雨伞、土布等手工业货源的组织工作。涟源县第十四区供销合作社除充实各种主要物资的库存，扩大百货经营品种，并先后把各种物资调拨到各门市部外，还增加了两个流动供应组，使农民在卖粮后能够便利地买到他们所需要的东西。宁乡县第八区供销合作社为了及时地把已经掌握的物资供应到农民手里，除在原有七个供销店大力供应外，还组织了五付货郎担，把货物送到粮食收购点去供应给农民。
