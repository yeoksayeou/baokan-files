By November 26th, the editorial department of this newspaper had received a total of 273 submissions regarding the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber," most of which supported the criticisms published in this newspaper. There were few new opinions, but a small number of submissions presented some different viewpoints on the articles by comrades Li Xifan and Lan Ling. This indicates that certain specific issues related to "Dream of the Red Chamber" should continue to be studied and discussed. Below are excerpts from some of the submissions.

"‘Dream of the Red Chamber Research’ Poisoned Me"

Li Feng from the Lanyang Prefecture Organ School in Shandong, wrote in an article titled "'Dream of the Red Chamber Research' Poisoned Me": "When I first read 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' I felt that the tragedy of Bao and Dai was caused by the evil old society, and I hated that man-eating society very much. But after reading 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research,' I stopped thinking about the ideological content of 'Dream of the Red Chamber.' Like Mr. Yu, I spent a lot of time trying to verify the concepts of 'lust' and 'emptiness.' After all that, not only did I not learn anything, but I was led into a maze!" The Chinese Department of Northeast Normal University wrote, "When we first saw 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research,' we were all happy that there was an expert writing a book to guide us in reading classical literature. But after reading it, we were confused. Mr. Yu only interpreted 'Dream of the Red Chamber' as a book for leisure, a book for 'breaking boredom and refreshing the mind, avoiding the world and relieving sorrow.' Then what value does 'Dream of the Red Chamber' have!"

Supporting This Serious Ideological Struggle

Zhang Hua from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said, "After reading the series of articles published in the newspaper criticizing Yu Pingbo's erroneous views, I was very excited. Although I am a chemist, I cannot remain silent. I resolutely oppose Yu Pingbo's erroneous interpretation of 'Dream of the Red Chamber.' I hope that this criticism can sweep away the poisonous gas permeating the study of classical literature." Wen Jiuding from the Zero-Nine-Four-Eight Unit Accelerated Middle School of the People's Liberation Army said: "I am not a specialist in literature, just an ordinary young reader, but I cannot help but care about this serious ideological struggle. Because the erroneous act of distorting our excellent classical literary works with old viewpoints is intolerable to anyone."

Readers Yu Xikun from the Tunxi City Textile Company in Anhui, Wu Daosheng, Ye Yang, Zhang Nanjie from the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, and Yang Jiasheng from the Wuyang Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Henan, all pointed out in their letters that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is an excellent realistic work with a clear anti-feudal tendency. Yu Pingbo ignores the social and historical content it reflects, but instead focuses on things like "a style of resentment without anger," distorting this great realistic tragedy into a naturalistic work. This error must be seriously criticized, otherwise readers will be led astray and will not be able to correctly read classical literary works and learn from them. Yang Jiasheng said in his letter, "The elders who study classical literature should use correct viewpoints to guide us in reading classical literary works. The way Yu Pingbo explains 'Dream of the Red Chamber' will only blur our vision and prevent us from seeing its true face. I strongly agree with criticizing this erroneous viewpoint."

Tang Lan from the Palace Museum, Lu Xinkang and Yu Kangcheng from Fudan University in Shanghai, and others, also sharply pointed out in their submissions that the growth and spread of Yu Pingbo and others' bourgeois viewpoints and methods in the study of classical literature are the consequences of the literary and art circles' disregard and neglect of criticism in the past. They hope that the literary and art circles will be vigilant through this criticism. They hope that literary and art workers will pay attention to this discussion and actively participate in it, so that this discussion can be carried out more deeply and meticulously, thereby establishing the glorious banner of Marxism in the study of classical literature and pushing the study of classical literature into a new stage.

Supporting the Criticism of "Literary Gazette"

Readers expressed enthusiastic support in their letters for the article "Questioning the Editors of 'Literary Gazette'" published in this newspaper. They believe that the "Literary Gazette's" basically negative criticism of the new author Li Zhun's novel "Can't Take That Road" not long ago, as well as the editor's note recently added by the "Literary Gazette" when reprinting Li Xifan and Lan Ling's "Brief Discussion on 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and Others," fully demonstrate that the "Literary Gazette" is treating young authors with a bourgeois aristocratic attitude. It is very necessary to give serious criticism to this ideological style of ignoring "small people" and looking down on new forces. Kong Rizhi from Hengnan County, Hunan, said that this article sounded an alarm for some writers and editors. Xu Yifang from the Trade Union Federation of Xikang Province also wrote, "This article forcefully criticized the erroneous ideological style of some literary and art journal editors and exposed their behavior of obstructing and suppressing new forces. It will surely win the sympathy and support of the broad masses."

The letters also exposed errors similar to those committed by the "Literary Gazette" in other literary and artistic journals or academic magazines. Xiao Xiangyang from the Beijing Film Studio, Zhu Jiayu from Peking University, Wen Ye from Northeast People's University, Kong Xiaohua from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and others, all pointed out in their letters that many newspaper and magazine editorial departments do not value letters and submissions from the masses. Some works by writers or celebrities are naturally worth publishing. However, there are also some works that are empty and meaningless, but they are still selected and published in prominent positions. The works of new authors are rarely selected, and even if they are, they are often placed in insignificant positions. They believe that this shows that these newspapers and magazines are ignoring "small people." Yao Renjie and Chen Enhong from Peking University also proved through their personal experiences how some newspaper and magazine editorial departments nod their heads to celebrities and dare not criticize "authorities." They once wrote an article on "intra-species struggle" in Darwinism and sent it to "Biological Bulletin," but it was returned because their views did not agree with those of a certain "authority." They believe that this is an academic issue and should be open for discussion.

Many readers requested that newspaper and magazine editorial departments treat the submissions of old writers and new writers, as well as those of unknown authors, fairly. Ouyang from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army said, "Why do editorial departments ignore new forces so much? Don't the editors of literary and art journals have a responsibility to cultivate and help new authors? Does the new China's literature and art not need new blood to enrich and strengthen it?" Kong Xiaohua said, "How much energy does it take for us beginners to write an article, and with what great enthusiasm do we send our articles to the editorial department, but what we get is indifference and neglect. Is this right?" Xu Qingbo from Central China Normal College more explicitly proposed that this erroneous behavior must be stopped, because it will stifle the "seedlings" in the field of literature and art, and it will bring harm to the Party's literary and artistic cause.

Readers unanimously demanded that the editorial departments of all newspapers and magazines must learn from the criticism of the "Literary Gazette" and improve their work. Their hopes for us are very earnest. He Kejia from Chaozhou, Guangdong, Liu Lunfu from Central China Normal College, and comrades from the Trade Union Federation of Tai'an County, Shandong, all proposed that in the future, all newspapers and magazines should seriously treat authors, eliminate erroneous ideological styles, and not only shout "cultivate new forces" in words and on paper, but also take practical and serious action.

What Exactly Was the Force That Shook the Foundation of the Feudal System?

Wang Bingyang from the Chinese Department of Nanjing Normal College sent three consecutive letters, expressing different opinions on the articles by Li Xifan and Lan Ling. He believes that Li Xifan and Lan Ling "merely seek the source of populism from within Cao Xueqin's personal spiritual world, without mentioning the progressive historical activities, progressive ideological aspirations, criticism of the feudal system at the time, and exploration of life paths of the people's masses, led by the peasants at the time, and the influence and driving force given to Cao's works." Wang Bingyang believes that the realistic life at that time took the class struggle between the peasants and the landlords as its axis. At that time, only the revolutionary struggle of the peasants was the only historical force that had an impact on the ruling power of the feudal landlord class to make it shake, and the only revolutionary factor that could cause a period of historical transformation.

Wang Bingyang said: "The actual viewpoint expressed by comrades Li and Lan in their discussion essentially inherits the mantle of the vulgar sociology school, which is one of the bourgeois schools. The characteristic of the vulgar sociology school in Chinese literary theory is generally to combine the decadent self-destruction theory of the feudal landlord class with the commercial capital revolution theory, and conduct fragmented textual research on economic consumption phenomena according to the economistic route of commodity-ism, so as to analyze the social background of literary works." He believes that this is wrong.

He also said: "The society reflected in 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' in its essence, is still the society of the night of the feudal system. The fundamental contradiction and fundamental problem at that time can only be the contradiction between the feudal landlord class and the peasants... The progressive, revolutionary, and popular aspects in it can only be the peasants and the working people led by the peasants. As far as the populism of literary works produced in this period is concerned, if it does not draw its source from the revolutionary initiation, revolutionary thoughts and feelings, and aspirations of the peasants and the working people led by the peasants, as well as their hatred and hostility towards the feudal system, then it has no populism at all... Comrades Li and Lan did not place the populism of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' on the progressive and revolutionary aspects of the real fundamental contradiction and fundamental problem. Thus, their actual conclusion is: the simple decadent collapse and death of the feudal landlord class is the source of the populism of 'Dream of the Red Chamber.' This theory is no different from Yu Pingbo's theory."

Wang Bingyang explained: In the era of "Dream of the Red Chamber," capitalism was only budding, and the bourgeoisie had not yet formed a class with an independent line and independent face politically and ideologically. And their commodities and their politics can generally only become an opportunity to promote the landlord class's reaction, decay, and internal strife. Wu Jingzi's "The Scholars," which was produced in the same period as "Dream of the Red Chamber," very realistically and profoundly reflects a part of this situation." He went on to say: "The reason why comrades Li and Lan regard Bao Yu and Dai Yu as capitalist newcomers is based on the premise that the main content of Bao and Dai's democratic thought is the democratic and free thought of striving for individual liberation and freedom of marriage, and this kind of thought can only be bourgeois thought. It cannot be anything else. This is completely wrong. Within feudal society, this is also the thought of the peasants and the working people led by the peasants. This kind of thought of the peasants and the working people led by the peasants has always been much stronger than this kind of thought of the bourgeoisie, and has been put forward in many literary works and folk stories long ago."

Therefore, he believes that "one of the sources of comrades Li and Lan's errors lies in their having an empty concept and rigid dogma that after feudalism passes, it is and can only be capitalism, and they seize this dogma without analyzing the specific historical situation at all... 'After feudal society passes, it is and can only be capitalist society' is precisely the thought of some bourgeois elements now, and it is the ideological weapon that the Chinese bourgeoisie has used to fight against the Chinese proletariat for many years." He believes that this erroneous point of view must be corrected.

Is Jia Baoyu a "Bud of a New Person"?

Regarding the socio-economic structure of the era of "Dream of the Red Chamber," Wu Dakun from Shandong University believes that Li Xifan and Lan Ling's statement in "Critique of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research'" that "Jia Baoyu... is the bud of a new person who is about to appear in the transforming society at that time" is incorrect. When explaining this argument, Li Xifan and Lan Ling said: "After the commodity economy was destroyed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, it had developed to a certain height again by the Qianlong era, especially the development of commercial capital was even more astonishing... At the same time, the frequent contact with foreign goods at this time was also unprecedented (many utensils in the Jia family were foreign goods). It can be seen that this period has already begun to possess some characteristics of the period of primitive accumulation of capitalism... The so-called 'Prosperous Age of Qianlong and Jiaqing' was precisely the era in which the bud of capitalism was conceived. Therefore, the characteristics of the transition period are also displayed in social relations." Wu Dakun believes that the so-called "primitive accumulation of capitalism," according to Marx's definition, is "the historical process of separating the producers from the means of production," "This process transforms the social means of subsistence and means of production into capital on the one hand, and transforms the direct producers into wage laborers on the other hand." ("Capital," Volume 1, page 903) However, the social and economic development process during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty was not such a process. Li and Lan are confusing the development of commodity economy or commercial capital with "primitive accumulation of capitalism."

Wu Dakun quoted what Chairman Mao said: "The process of the emergence and development of Chinese national capitalism is the process of the emergence and development of the Chinese bourgeoisie and proletariat. If some merchants, landlords, and bureaucrats were the predecessors of the Chinese bourgeoisie, then some peasants and handicraft workers were the predecessors of the Chinese proletariat." (Mao Zedong: "Chinese Revolution and Chinese Communist Party") to illustrate the fundamental difference between the process of primitive accumulation of capital in China and the process of primitive accumulation of capital in Western capitalist societies. Wu Dakun said: "In the interior of Chinese feudal society, because commercial capital and usury capital were combined with land capital early, and became a 'trinity,' when it grew out of capitalist factors under the influence of foreign capitalist aggression, its process of primitive accumulation of capital was also completely different from the process of primitive accumulation in the West. Chairman Mao once explained the social nature of China before liberation, saying: 'Since foreign capitalism invaded China and capitalist factors have gradually grown in Chinese society, China has gradually become a colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal society.' (Mao Zedong: 'On New Democracy') This is the different consequence produced by two different 'capital accumulation processes.'"

Wu Dakun believes that the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty were a period of transition from prosperity to decline, but this transition was not due to the emergence of a "primitive accumulation process of capital," but due to the inherent contradictions existing within the Chinese feudal economy that were particularly developed during this period. "Due to the increasing exploitation by the rulers, the development of commercial capital, the prevalence of land annexation, the concentration of land rights, and the loss of land by the vast number of peasants and the unbearable cruel oppression by landlords, merchants, and usurers, they have begun to rise up to resist. We must not forget that the famous 'White Lotus Sect' and 'Heavenly Reason Sect' uprisings in Qing Dynasty occurred precisely during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods."

In addition to excerpting and publishing the above opinions, the editorial department of this newspaper has asked the authors to conduct further exploration and explanation of this issue.

### 对“红楼梦”研究问题的意见

专栏：

    对“红楼梦”研究问题的意见
    到十一月二十六日为止，本报编辑部共接到二百七十三件关于“红楼梦”研究问题的来稿来信，大都支持本报的批评，新的意见不多，但也有少数来稿来信对李希凡、蓝翎两同志的文章提出若干不同的意见。这说明了关于“红楼梦”的某些具体问题还应该继续加以研究和讨论。下面是部分来稿来信的摘要。
    “‘红楼梦研究’毒害了我”
    山东莱阳专区机关学校李锋，在题为“‘红楼梦研究’毒害了我”一文中写道：“我最初阅读‘红楼梦’时，感到宝、黛的悲剧是万恶的旧社会造成的，因而十分痛恨那种吃人的社会，及至看了‘红楼梦研究’后，我不再去思索‘红楼梦’的思想内容是什么，也像俞先生那样，花了很多时间，去印证什么‘色’‘空’观念。搞来搞去，不唯没有学到什么，反而被引到迷魂阵里去了！”东北师范大学中文系如今来信说：“刚看到‘红楼梦研究’时，我们都因有专家著书，指导我们阅读古典文学作品而高兴。可是看完后，我们却迷惑了。俞先生只把‘红楼梦’解释为一部消闲的书，一部‘破闷醒目、避世消愁’的书，那么‘红楼梦’还有什么价值呢！”
    支持这一个严重的思想斗争
    中国科学院张化说，“看了报纸发表的一系列的批评俞平伯错误观点的文章后，我非常激动。虽然我是一个化学工作者，我也不能沉默了。我坚决反对俞平伯对‘红楼梦’所作的错误解释，我希望通过这次批判能扫清弥漫在古典文学研究工作中的毒气。”解放军零九四八部速成中学文九鼎说：
  “我不是专门搞文学的人，只是一个普通的青年读者，但对这一严重的思想斗争，我不能不关心。因为用旧的观点来歪曲我们优秀的古典文学作品的错误事实，是任何人不能容忍的。”
    安徽屯溪市花纱布公司俞希堃、北京外国语学院吴道生、叶阳、章南杰、河南舞阳农业技术推广站杨稼生等读者，在来信中都这样指出：“红楼梦”是一部优秀的现实主义作品，它是具有鲜明的反封建的倾向性的；俞平伯丢开它所反映的社会历史内容不谈，却在什么“怨而不怒的风格”等方面下功夫，将这部伟大的现实主义悲剧，歪曲成一部自然主义作品，这一错误是必须予以严正批判的，否则读者就会被它引入迷途，不可能正确地阅读古典文学作品，从中获得教益了。杨稼生在来信中说，“研究古典文学的先辈们，应该用正确的观点来指导我们阅读古典文学作品。像俞平伯这样解释‘红楼梦’，只会模糊我们的视线，使我们看不清它的真面目。我非常同意对这种错误观点进行批判。”
    故宫博物院唐兰、上海复旦大学陆新康、俞康成等，在他们来稿来信中还尖锐地指出，俞平伯等人的资产阶级观点、方法，在古典文学研究工作中的滋长、蔓延，是过去文艺界对这种错误熟视无睹、忽视批评所造成的后果。他们希望通过这次批判，文艺界能提高警惕；他们希望文艺工作者们都能重视这一讨论，并积极地参加这个讨论，使这个讨论能更深入、更细致地开展，从而在古典文学研究工作中将马克思主义的光辉旗帜树立起来，将古典文学研究工作推入一个新的阶段。
    支持对“文艺报”的批评
    读者在来信中对本报所载“质问‘文艺报’编者”一文，热烈地表示支持。他们认为：不久前，“文艺报”对新作者李准的小说“不能走那一条路”所加的基本否定的批评，以及最近“文艺报”在转载李希凡、蓝翎“关于‘红楼梦简论’及其它”一文所加的编者按语，充分说明了“文艺报”是以资产阶级贵族老爷式态度来对待青年作者。对这种忽视“小人物”、看轻新生力量的思想作风，予以严正的批评，是非常必要的。湖南衡南县孔日知说这篇文章对某些作家和编辑敲了一次警钟。西康省工会联合会胥义方来信中也说：“这篇文章有力地抨击了某些文艺刊物编辑工作者的错误的思想作风，揭露了他们阻拦和压制新生力量的行为，它一定会得到广大群众的同情和支持。”
    来信中也揭露了其它文艺刊物或学术性杂志所犯的与“文艺报”相类似的错误。北京电影制片厂萧向阳、北京大学朱家玉、东北人民大学温野、解放军某部孔小划等，在来信中都提出：不少报刊杂志编辑部不重视群众来信、来稿。作家或名人的有些作品，有些自然是值得刊载的作品。但也有内容空洞、言之无物的，可是仍然被选用，而且被登在显著地位。新作者的作品很少被选用，即是有，也往往被摆在极不重要的地位。他们认为这就可以说明这些报刊杂志是忽视“小人物”的。北京大学姚仁杰、陈恩鸿还通过他们亲身的遭遇，证明某些报刊杂志编辑部如何对名人一概加以点头，如何不敢批评“权威”。他们曾经写了一篇有关达尔文主义中“种内斗争”的文章寄给“生物学通报”，被退回来，退稿的原因就是因为他们的见解与某“权威”的见解不合。他们认为，这是一个学术问题，应该容许展开讨论。
    许多读者要求报刊杂志编辑部公平地对待老作家和新作家以至不知名的作者的来稿。解放军某部欧阳说：“为什么编辑部这样忽视新生力量呢？难道文艺刊物的编者没有责任来培养和帮助新的作者？难道新中国的文学艺术不需要新的血液来充实、壮大吗？”孔小划说：“我们初学写作的人，写一篇文章要费多大的精力，我们是怀着多么大的热情把自己的文章送到编辑部去的，但是我们得到的却是冷淡和漠视，这是应该的吗？”华中师范学院许清波更明确地提出，必须制止这种错误行为，因为它将扼杀文学艺术领域的“青苗”，它将给党的文学艺术事业带来危害。
    读者们一致要求，各报刊杂志编辑部必须从对
  “文艺报”的批评中吸取教训，改进工作。他们对我们的希望是很殷切的。广东潮州何克家、华中师范学院刘伦夫、和山东泰安县工会联合会的同志们都提出，希望今后各报刊杂志都能认真地对待作者，消灭错误的思想作风；不光在口头上、笔尖上喊“培养新生力量”，而且要切实认真地行动起来。
    动摇封建制度基础的力量究竟是什么？
    南京师范学院中文系王冰洋连续寄来三封信，对李希凡、蓝翎的文章提出不同的意见。他认为李希凡、蓝翎“仅仅从曹雪芹个人的精神世界的内部追求人民性的源泉，而没有提到当时以农民为首的人民群众的进步的历史活动、进步的思想愿望、对当时封建制度的批判和仇恨以及对生活道路的探求所给予曹氏著作的影响和推动力量。”王冰洋认为：当时的现实生活是以农民和地主间的阶级斗争为轴心的。在那时候，只有农民的革命斗争，才是唯一有冲击封建地主阶级统治权使其发生动摇的历史力量，才是唯一能够造成历史转变期的革命因素。
    王冰洋说：“李、蓝二位同志在他们的论述中所表现的实际观点，实质上继承了作为资产阶级学派之一的庸俗社会学派的衣钵。中国的文学理论上的庸俗社会学派的特点，一般的就是把封建地主阶级腐朽自亡论和商业资本革命论相结合，按照唯商品主义的经济主义路线进行关于经济消费现象的杂碎考证，据以分析文学作品的社会背景。”他认为这是错误的。
    他又说：“‘红楼梦’所反映的社会，按其实质说来，还是封建制度子夜时期的社会，当时根本矛盾和根本问题，只能是封建地主阶级和农民之间的矛盾。……其中的进步的、革命的、人民的方面，只能是农民以及以农民为首的劳动人民。就产生在这个时期中的文学作品的人民性而论，如果不是从农民以及以农民为首的劳动人民的革命的发动、革命的思想感情和愿望以及他们对于封建制度的憎恨、仇视吸取源泉，那它就根本没有任何人民性之可言。……李、蓝二同志并没有把‘红楼梦’的人民性放置在真正的根本矛盾根本问题的进步的革命的方面。这样，他们的实际结论就是：单纯的封建地主阶级的腐朽崩溃死亡，就是‘红楼梦’的人民性的源泉。这个理论和俞平伯的理论并无不同之点。”
    王冰洋说明：在“红楼梦”时代，资本主义还只是萌芽，资产阶级还没有组成为一个在政治上在思想上有独立路线和独立面貌的阶级。而他们的商品以及他们在政治上，一般的只能成为促进地主阶级反动、腐朽以及内部倾轧的一个契机。和“红楼梦”产生于同一时期的吴敬梓的“儒林外史”，就很真实很深刻地反映了这种情况的一部分。”他接着说：“李、蓝二同志之所以把宝玉黛玉看成资本主义新人，是从这样一点前提出发的：宝、黛的民主思想的主要内容，是争取个性解放、婚姻自由的民主自由思想，而这种思想，只能是资产阶级思想。不能是别的。这是完全错误的。在封建社会内，这也是农民以及以农民为首的劳动人民的思想。农民以及以农民为首的劳动人民的这种思想，一直是比资产阶级的这种思想要坚强得多，并且早就在许多文学作品和民间故事里提出来了。”
    因此，他认为“李、蓝二同志的错误的来源之一就在于他们有着一个封建主义过去以后就是而且只能是资本主义这个空洞概念和死板教条，抓住这个教条，一点也不分析具体的历史情况。……‘封建社会过去以后，就是而且只能是资本主义社会’正是现在某些资产阶级分子的思想，正是若干年来中国资产阶级与中国无产阶级进行斗争的思想武器。”他认为这个错误的观点必须纠正。
    贾宝玉是“新人的萌芽”吗？
    关于“红楼梦”时代的社会经济结构问题，山东大学吴大琨认为李希凡、蓝翎在“评‘红楼梦研究’”一文内所说“贾宝玉……是当时将要转换着的社会中即将出现的新人的萌芽”是不正确的。李希凡、蓝翎在说明这一论点的时候，曾说：“明末清初商品经济遭到破坏后，到了乾隆时代又已发展到一定的高度，尤其是商业资本的发展更是惊人。……同时这时和外国商品接触的频繁也是空前的
  （贾府中许多用具都是外国商品）。可见这个时期已经开始具备了资本主义原始蓄积期的一些特点。……所谓‘乾嘉盛世’就正是资本主义萌芽孕育的时代，因此，在社会关系上也显示出转变期的特点。”吴大琨认为：所谓“资本主义原始蓄积”，依照马克思的定义，就是“生产者与生产资料分离的历史过程”，“这个过程，一方把社会的生活资料及生产资料转化为资本，他方就把直接生产者转化为工资劳动者。”（“资本论”第一卷九○三页）而满清乾嘉时期的社会经济发展过程并不是这样的过程。李、蓝两同志是把商品经济或商品资本的发展，和“资本主义的原始蓄积”混为一谈了。
    吴大琨引用了毛主席所说的“中国民族资本主义发生和发展的过程，就是中国资产阶级和无产阶级发生和发展的过程。如果一部分的商人、地主和官僚是中国资产阶级的前身，那末，一部分的农民和手工业工人就是中国无产阶级的前身了。”（毛泽东：“中国革命和中国共产党”）来说明中国的资本原始蓄积过程与西洋资本主义社会的资本原始蓄积过程的基本不同点。吴大琨说：“在中国的封建社会内部由于商业资本高利贷资本的早与土地资本结合在一起，成为了‘三位一体’的东西，所以当其在外来的资本主义侵略影响下，生长出资本主义因素来的时候，其资本的原始蓄积过程，也就完全与西洋的原始蓄积过程完全不同。毛主席曾说明中国在解放前的社会性质说：‘自外国资本主义侵略中国，中国社会又逐渐地生长了资本主义因素以来，中国已逐渐地变成了一个殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的社会。’（毛泽东：‘新民主主义论’）这就是两种不同的‘资本蓄积过程’所产生的不同后果。”
    吴大琨认为清代的乾嘉时期是由盛趋衰的转变时期，但这转变，却并非由于产生“资本原始蓄积过程”，而是由于存在在中国封建经济内部的固有矛盾在这时期又特别发展了的结果。“由于统治者的榨取日多，商业资本的发展，土地兼并的盛行，地权的集中，广大农民的丧失土地和不堪地主、商人、高利贷者的残酷压迫，已在开始起而反抗。我们不能忘记清代历史上有名的‘白莲教’‘天理教’起义，就正是在乾嘉时期发生的。”
    除摘录以上意见加以发表外，本报编辑部已请作者对这一问题作进一步的探讨和说明。
