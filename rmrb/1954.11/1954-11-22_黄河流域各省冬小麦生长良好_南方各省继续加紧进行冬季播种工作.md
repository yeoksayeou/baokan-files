Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The sowing of winter wheat has ended in the provinces of the Yellow River Basin. The total sown area of ​​winter wheat in the main producing provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu reached more than 220 million mu, completing the state plan. Among them, Shandong Province reached 63.48 million mu, exceeding the plan by 1.56 percent. Wheat seedlings are generally growing well in various places. Southern provinces are still stepping up the sowing of wheat, rapeseed, and green manure crops. Winter sowing in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces has entered the final stage, and it has also started in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces. Jiangsu Province plans to plant 34 million mu of wheat this winter, and more than 27 million mu had been planted by early November. As of November 12, the winter sowing area in Anhui Province had reached more than 51.86 million mu, accounting for 87 percent of the plan. With the support of the state, farmers in some waterlogged areas of Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, and other seven provinces have drained water and sown a total of 70 million mu.

With the advocacy and support of the state, the sowing quality of winter sowing in many areas this year has been significantly improved compared to last year. This is mainly reflected in the expansion of deep plowing and fertilization areas, the increased use of improved varieties and seed soaking by farmers, and the widespread expansion of close planting areas. In Hebei Province, apart from the areas sown after drainage, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields this year is generally more than 10 percent higher than last year. Farmers in Shanxi Province used 17 million jin of disease-resistant and high-yield improved wheat varieties this year. Shandong Province expanded the sown area of ​​improved varieties by another 12 million mu on the basis of 25 million mu last year, accounting for 55 percent of the wheat sown area. In Hebei and Shandong provinces, the close planting area accounted for 20 percent of the wheat field area last year, and 30 percent this year.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China pointed out: Because of good soil moisture, there are fewer seedling shortages in the newly sown wheat fields in northern provinces this year than in previous years. However, due to continuous overcast and rainy weather in the later period, some wheat has been waterlogged and rotted, especially in areas where wheat is sown after drainage; in addition to underground pests and other reasons, the seedling shortage in wheat fields in southern Henan Province generally still reaches 15 percent, and severely reaches more than 30 percent. Wheat fields in northern Henan generally also have a seedling shortage of 10 percent. Some areas in southern provinces have experienced drought since October, which has had a greater impact on winter sowing. Currently, rural work is busy, and many areas have a tendency to relax winter sowing work. Now, time is very tight, and provinces that have not yet completed winter sowing should immediately strengthen leadership and strive to complete this year's winter sowing plan; provinces that have completed winter sowing must also seize the time to lead farmers to continue to check fields and replant seedlings.

### 黄河流域各省冬小麦生长良好  南方各省继续加紧进行冬季播种工作

    黄河流域各省冬小麦生长良好
    南方各省继续加紧进行冬季播种工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】黄河流域各省播种冬小麦已经结束。冬小麦主要产区河南、山东、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃等省播种面积共达到二亿二千多万亩，完成了国家计划。其中山东省播种面积达到六千三百四十八万亩，超过计划百分之一点五六。各地麦苗一般生长良好。南方各省还在继续加紧播种小麦、油菜和绿肥作物。江苏、安徽、湖北、四川等省的冬种都已进入最后阶段，福建、广东、广西等省也已开始。江苏省今冬计划种小麦三千四百万亩，十一月上旬已种二千七百多万亩。截至十一月十二日，安徽省冬种面积已达五千一百八十六万多亩，为计划的百分之八十七。安徽、湖北、湖南、江西、江苏、河南、河北等七省的部分积水地区，农民在国家支援下排水冬种面积共达七千万亩。
    在国家的提倡和支援下，许多地区今年冬种的播种质量比去年有显著的改进。这主要表现在深耕、施肥面积扩大，农民采用良种和浸种拌种的增多，密植面积也普遍扩大了。河北省除排水所种的以外，今年麦田施肥量普遍比去年多百分之十以上。山西省农民今年使用抗病、高产的优良麦种有一千七百万斤。山东省今年良种播种面积在去年二千五百万亩的基础上又扩大了一千二百万亩，共占小麦播种面积的百分之五十五。河北、山东两省密植面积去年占麦田面积的百分之二十，今年占百分之三十。
    中华人民共和国农业部指出：今年北方各省新种麦田因墒好，缺苗现象比往年轻。但后期连绵阴雨，小麦有些受涝霉烂，特别是排水种麦的地方；加以地下虫害等原因，河南省豫南地区麦田缺苗一般仍达到百分之十五，严重的达百分之三十以上。豫北地区麦田一般也缺苗百分之十。南方各省部分地区十月以来发生旱象，对冬种影响较大。目前农村工作较忙，许多地区对冬种工作有放松倾向。现在，时间已很紧迫，还没有完成冬种的各省应即加强领导，争取完成今年的冬种计划；已完成各省也须抓紧时间，领导农民继续查田补苗。
