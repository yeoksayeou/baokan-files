Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 29th: TASS Moscow, November 29th: The European Conference on Guaranteeing European Peace and Security opened in Moscow on the afternoon of November 29th at 3:00 PM.

Participating in the conference were delegations from the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Romanian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of Albania.

Observers from the Government of the People's Republic of China participated in the conference.

The conference was opened by V.M. Molotov, head of the Soviet delegation.

Molotov first expressed that it was regrettable that not all invited countries considered it possible to participate in the discussion of the question of establishing a European collective security system of concern to the European people. He said that under the current circumstances, peace-loving countries could no longer limit themselves to the various measures that had been taken in the past to guarantee peace and their own security. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believed that the conference of European countries to guarantee European peace and collective security should be held by the countries that have now accepted the invitation.

Cyrankiewicz, head of the delegation of the People's Republic of Poland, and Široký, head of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, supported the proposal to hold the conference by the countries that had already arrived. Representatives from the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and the People's Republic of China also agreed to this proposal.

Subsequently, Molotov, head of the Soviet delegation, made a long speech at the conference.

Welcoming them at the Moscow Kiev Railway Station were: First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Molotov, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Gromyko, other officials of the Soviet government, and personnel from the Czechoslovak and Hungarian Embassies in the Soviet Union.

Široký made a speech at the railway station, saying that we came to Moscow with a particularly important mission: to participate in the European conference on discussing European collective security. At present, a strong national patriotic movement has been launched throughout our country. Through this movement, the people express their unconditional support for the Soviet Union's proposals and express extreme indignation and protest against the Paris Accords. The people entrust us to cooperate friendly with the Soviet Union and the delegations of all countries participating in the conference and to do our best to consolidate and strengthen European security and peace. Once the signatories of the Paris Accords approve these accords, our people will do everything possible to strengthen our security.

Hegedüs also made a speech saying: The issues to be discussed at this European conference are of paramount importance to the people of all countries, including the Hungarian people. This conference will contribute to the establishment of a European collective security system, prevent the armament of West Germany and the revival of German militarism. Therefore, this conference will not only be beneficial to the cause of peace in Europe, but also to the cause of peace in the world. Hegedüs expressed that the Hungarian people wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's proposal, because it is a proposal that conforms to the vital interests of the Hungarian people.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: TASS Moscow: The government delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria headed by Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Yugov of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the government delegation of the Romanian People's Republic headed by First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Stoica of the Romanian People's Republic arrived in Moscow on the 28th to attend the conference on discussing guaranteeing European peace and security.

He said: The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria believes that the European conference is being convened at a very important moment, and this conference will be a new and powerful impetus for the struggle of peace-loving people against the London and Paris Accords and for safeguarding the security of the European people. Yugov also said: The Bulgarian people realize that the main condition for winning the struggle for peace and against aggression is the unity of peace-loving countries and the common friendship with the great Soviet Union.

Stoica also delivered a speech, on behalf of the Romanian people and the government of the Romanian People's Republic, he expressed warm respect to the great Soviet people and the Soviet government, and said: The Romanian People's Republic is filled with firm determination to make a positive contribution to the cause of defending peace together with all peace-loving countries. The delegation is deeply convinced that this European conference will make a valuable contribution to the cause of defending peace and guaranteeing European collective security.

    讨论保障欧洲和平和安全问题
    欧洲会议在莫斯科开幕
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议二十九日下午三时在莫斯科开幕。
    参加会议的有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、波兰人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的代表团。

    会议由苏联代表团团长维·米·莫洛托夫主持开幕。
    莫洛托夫首先表示，并不是所有被邀请的国家都认为可以参加关于建立欧洲人民所关心的欧洲集体安全体系的问题的讨论，这是很令人遗憾的。他说，在目前情况之下，爱好和平的国家在保障和平和自身安全的问题上已经不能仅限于采取过去所曾采取过的种种措施，因此，苏联代表团认为，欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和集体安全的会议应该由现在已经接受邀请的国家举行。
    波兰人民共和国代表团团长西伦凯维兹和捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团团长西罗基支持由已经到会的国家举行会议的建议。德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚和中华人民共和国的代表也都同意这项建议。

    赫格居斯也发表谈话说：这次欧洲国家会议上将要讨论的问题对世界各国人民，包括匈牙利人民在内，具有头等重要意义。这次会议将有助于欧洲集体安全体系的建立，将防止西德的武装和德国军国主义的复活，因而这次会议将不仅有利于欧洲的和平事业，而且也有利于世界的和平事业。赫格居斯表示匈牙利人民衷心拥护苏联的建议，因为它是符合匈牙利人民切身利益的建议。
