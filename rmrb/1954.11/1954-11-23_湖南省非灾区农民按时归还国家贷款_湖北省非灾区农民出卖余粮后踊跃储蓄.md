    Hunan Province Non-Disaster Area Farmers Repay National Loans on Time
    Hubei Province Non-Disaster Area Farmers Actively Save After Selling Surplus Grain
    Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in non-disaster areas of Hunan Province, while selling surplus grain, are also repaying national loans. As of early November, they had repaid more than 192 billion yuan in loans to the state, accounting for 70 percent of the loan amount that the Hunan Branch of the People's Bank of China plans to recover this year. Farmers in non-disaster areas are continuing to repay their national loans. Hengyue Township in Hengshan County suffered a mountain flood in June this year. Thanks to timely national loans, the 15 damaged ponds and dams in the township were quickly repaired. This year, the township had a bumper harvest of rice. After selling the surplus grain, the farmers quickly repaid the national loans.
    Xinhua News Agency: In October, when the unified purchase of grain in non-disaster areas of Hubei Province had just begun, farmers deposited 8.2 billion yuan of the money from selling surplus grain in banks. Recently, the unified purchase of grain has been fully launched, and farmers are even more enthusiastic about depositing money in banks. After selling surplus grain, the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxi Township, Changyang County, first saved more than 4 million yuan. Zhang Shenghua, a farmer in Qianjin Township, Hefeng County, used the interest from last year's savings to buy 30 jin of salt, solving his family's salt problem. This year, before the grain purchase in Qianjin Township has even started, he has already planned to sell all 2,800 jin of surplus grain to the state, and deposit most of the proceeds in the bank.

    湖南省非灾区农民按时归还国家贷款
    湖北省非灾区农民出卖余粮后踊跃储蓄
    湖南省非灾区农民一面出售余粮，一面归还国家贷款，到十一月上旬止，已还给国家的贷款有一千九百二十多亿元，占中国人民银行湖南省分行今年计划收回贷款数的百分之七十。现在非灾区农民还在继续归还国家贷款。衡山县横岳乡今年六月间曾遭受山洪侵袭，由于得到国家及时贷款，使乡里十五座被冲坏的塘坝很快修好了，今年全乡水稻丰收，农民们在出售余粮后就迅速还清了国家的贷款。　　　（新华社）
    十月份，湖北省非灾区粮食统购刚刚开始，农民向银行储蓄出售余粮的钱有八十二亿元。近来粮食统购工作已全面展开，农民把钱存入银行的更踊跃了。长阳县芦溪乡红星农业生产合作社出售余粮后，首先储蓄了四百多万元。鹤峰县千金乡农民张盛华今年得到去年的存款利息，买了三十斤食盐，解决了全家的食盐问题，今年千金乡还未开始购粮，他已准备把二千八百斤余粮全部卖给国家，卖粮款绝大部分存到银行去。　　　　（新华社）
