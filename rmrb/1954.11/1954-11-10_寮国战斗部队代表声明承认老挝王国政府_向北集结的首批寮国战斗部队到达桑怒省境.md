Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Vientiane Dispatch:辛卡波, Lao Fighting Units representative to the Lao Joint Armistice Commission, issued the following statement on November 4th: In the spirit of strictly implementing the Geneva Accords and broadly uniting national forces to consolidate peace and realize national unification, the Lao Fighting Units recognize the Royal Lao Government and declare that, in principle, the Lao administrative organs in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces are under the supreme supervision of the Royal Lao Government.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Hanoi Dispatch: Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 6th, commenting on the Lao Fighting Units' statement regarding the recognition of the Royal Lao Government. The commentary is as follows:

Article 14 of the Lao Armistice Agreement stipulates that, pending a political settlement, the Lao combat units should move to the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, where they have complete freedom of passage in a corridor along the Vietnamese-Lao border.

It is well known that Lao resistance fighters, especially the soldiers of the Lao Fighting Units, have always been ardent patriots. They have endured various sacrifices and hardships and have fought for eight or nine years to establish a peaceful, independent, unified, and democratic Laos. Today, peace has been restored, and in order to broadly unite national forces to consolidate peace and realize the unification of Laos, they have recognized the Royal Lao Government and declared that, in principle, the Lao administrative organs of Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces—where the Lao Fighting Units are entitled to be stationed according to Article 14 of the Geneva Accords—are now under the supreme supervision of the Royal Lao Government. This fact once again proves that the soldiers of the Lao Fighting Units love their country and peace, and always put the interests of their country above their own. They are worthy of being the lovable sons of the people of this country and the best citizens of Laos.

People from all walks of life in Laos will inevitably praise this noble attitude. The Vietnamese people also praise this noble attitude. Moreover, the Lao people hope that the Royal Lao Government will clearly recognize its responsibility to the Lao nation in the cause of striving for the peace, independence, and democracy of this country, in order to correctly implement Article 15 of the Lao Armistice Agreement, which stipulates that each party guarantees that it will not take any retaliatory or discriminatory action against any person or group because of their wartime cooperation with the other party, and guarantees their democratic freedoms . Obviously, the Lao people also hope that the Royal Lao Government and the French Federation forces in Laos will take the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of actions that undermine the armistice agreement, such as: air-dropping armed bandits to loot the people in the assembly areas of Phongsaly and Sam Neua, such as the Pang Noi incident in Phongsaly Province; retaliation and massacres against Lao civilians, such as the Soi Chai incident on the border of Vientiane Province on October 19th.

The Vietnamese people sincerely hope that the cooperation between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units will bring good results.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 7th: In accordance with the provisions of the Lao Armistice Agreement, the first batch of Lao Fighting Units assembling from central and southern Laos to the north arrived on the 6th in the assembly area of northern Laos - Sam Neua province.

These northern-bound Lao soldiers are all in high spirits and well-equipped. They are wearing grass-green uniforms made in the liberated areas, carrying sufficient automatic firearms and other weapons, many of which are American-made weapons seized from the French army.

The Lao Fighting Units operating in southern Laos assembled in the Laoyan area of Salavan Province after the ceasefire and began moving north on August 23. During the scorching heat of the season, they crossed countless high mountains and ridges on the Vietnamese-Lao border and trekked more than 700 kilometers, finally arriving at the assembly area in northern Laos. During the transfer process, sometimes encountering days of continuous rain, the soldiers erected tents in the deserted primeval forest, rested briefly, and then continued to advance in the rain. When the food they carried was exhausted, they looked for wild bamboo shoots to satisfy their hunger. In addition to these difficulties, the Lao Fighting Units also overcame various obstacles from the Lao Royal Army and successfully arrived at the assembly area.

According to the armistice agreement, the Lao Fighting Units from all regions will be completely assembled in the two provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua by November 20, that is, within 120 days after the agreement takes effect.

    寮国战斗部队代表声明承认老挝王国政府
    向北集结的首批寮国战斗部队到达桑怒省境
    【新华社七日讯】越南通讯社老挝讯：老挝联合停战委员会寮国战斗部队代表辛卡波在十一月四日发表下列声明：在严格履行日内瓦协定和广泛团结全国力量以巩固和平和实现国家统一的精神下，寮国战斗部队承认老挝王国政府，并宣布，在原则上，丰沙里和桑怒两省的寮国行政机构是在老挝王国政府的最高监督之下。
     【新华社七日讯】越南通讯社六日发表评论，评寮国战斗部队关于承认老挝王国政府的声明。评论如下：
    老挝停战协定第十四条规定，在等待政治解决期间，寮国各战斗单位应转移至桑怒和丰沙里两省，在该两省之间，他们在一条沿越、老边境的走廊上有通行的完全自由。
    众所周知，老挝抗战人士，首先是寮国战斗部队战士，一直是热烈的爱国者。他们遭受了各种牺牲，经历了各种艰难困苦，为了建立一个和平、独立、统一和民主的老挝而进行了八、九年的战斗。今天，和平已经恢复了，为了广泛地团结全国力量来巩固和平和实现老挝的统一，他们已承认了老挝王国政府，并声明：在原则上，丰沙里和桑怒两省——根据日内瓦协定第十四条的规定，寮国战斗单位有权驻在那边——的寮国行政机构现在是在老挝王国政府的最高监督之下。这个事实再一次证明，寮国战斗部队战士热爱祖国和和平，始终把祖国的利益放在他们自己的利益之上。他们不愧为这个国家人民的可爱的儿子和老挝的最优秀的公民。
    老挝各阶层人民必然都称赞这种高尚的态度。越南人民也赞扬这种高尚的态度。而且，老挝人民希望老挝王国政府清楚地认识到在争取这个国家的和平、独立和民主的事业方面，它对老挝国家所负的责任，以正确地实行老挝停战协定第十五条，这一条款规定，每方保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时和另一方合作的活动而采取任何报复或歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。显然，老挝人民还希望王国政府和老挝境内的法兰西联邦部队采取必要措施，防止破坏停战协定行动的再度发生，这些行动有：在丰沙里和桑怒集结区空投武装匪徒抢劫人民，如丰沙里省磅怒事件；对老挝平民进行报复和屠杀，如十月十九日在万象省边界发生的索寨事件。
    越南人民热诚地希望老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的合作将带来良好结果。
    【新华社河内七日电】按照老挝停战协定的规定，从老挝中部、南部向北集结的寮国战斗部队第一批在六日到达老挝北部的集结区——桑怒省境。
    这些北来的寮国战士个个精神饱满，装备精良。他们穿着解放区自制的草绿色军装，带有充足的自动火器和其他武器，其中有不少是从法军方面缴获的美国制造的武器。
    在老挝南部作战的寮国战斗部队，停战后即在沙拉湾省的寮彦地区集结，并于八月二十三日开始向北部转移。在烈日酷暑的季节里，他们翻越了越南—老挝边境的无数高山峻岭，跋涉了七百多公里，终于到达老挝北部的集结地区。在转移过程中，有时遇到霪雨的日子，战士们就在渺无人烟的原始森林中搭起帐篷，稍事休息后即继续冒雨前进。携带的粮食吃完了，他们就寻找野生的竹笋充饥。除了这些困难以外，寮国战斗部队还排除了老挝王国部队的各种阻挠，胜利地到达了集结区。
      依照停战协定，各地的寮国战斗部队将在十一月二十日，即协定生效后的一百二十天内，全部结集到丰沙里和桑怒两省。
