Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 28th: Preparations for the construction of large-scale state-owned grain farms have received enthusiastic support from all quarters.

　　Xinglong Town, near the site of the large-scale farm, is a small town of just over 600 households on the western edge of the wilderness. With the strong support of various parties, the Soviet experts of the land consolidation survey team and more than 100 Chinese personnel assisting them quickly settled down in Xinglong Town and comprehensively, rapidly, and smoothly launched the surveying and investigation of the wasteland. The CPC Hejiang Local Committee and Hejiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office have designated special personnel to organize support work for the construction of large-scale farms. The Ninth District Committee of the CPC Jixian County and the Ninth District People's Government have given all the houses in Xinglong Town to the staff of the large-scale farm for accommodation and office use. The local state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives quickly transported a large number of fresh vegetables, pork, eggs, and other needed items from other places to ensure a constant supply. Ten days ago, when the Soviet experts of the land consolidation survey team first inspected the wasteland, there were only two jeeps; now, more than a dozen trucks and jeeps are dispatched every day. These vehicles were successively allocated by local transportation companies and state-owned farms hundreds of miles away to support the wasteland survey work. Farms such as Shuguang, Jiu San, and Bijia Mountain have all selected drivers and cars to come along.

　　Fulitun, a railway station west of Xinglong Town and closest to the site of the large-scale farm, is where agricultural machinery and equipment donated by the Soviet people are received. Here, houses for Soviet experts and Chinese staff to live and work in, and places to park machines, have now been repaired. Four weeks ago, when the staff responsible for preparing the houses arrived here, they had nothing but a letter of introduction. The local construction workers' union immediately mobilized many workers and began to repair the houses urgently. The director of the Jixian County Local State-Owned Iron Factory led the workers to work day and night to install heating and other equipment in the houses where Soviet experts lived and worked. The local State-owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company also simplified procedures and adequately supplied the materials needed for repairs.

    建设大型农场准备工作得到各方热情支援
    【新华社哈尔滨二十八日电】建设大型国营谷物农场的准备工作得到了各方面的热情支援。
    大型农场场址附近的兴隆镇，是荒草原西边的一个只有六百多户居民的小镇。土地整理考察组的苏联专家和协助他们工作的一百多名我国工作人员，在各方面的有力支援下，很快地在兴隆镇安置下来，全面、迅速、顺利地展开了荒地的勘测调查工作。中共合江地方委员会和合江专署都指定了专人，组织对大型农场建设的支援工作。中共集贤县第九区委员会和第九区人民政府在兴隆镇的房屋，全部让给大型农场工作人员们住宿和办公。当地的国营商店和供销合作社迅速地由外地运来了大量新鲜的蔬菜、猪肉、鸡蛋和其他需用的物品，保证随时供应。十天前，当土地整理考察组的苏联专家第一次察看荒地的时候，还只有两辆吉普车；现在每天出动的大卡车、吉普车已经有十多辆了。这些汽车，都是当地运输公司和几百里外的国营农场先后拨来支援荒地勘察工作的。曙光、九三、笔架山等农场都选派了司机和汽车同来。
    在兴隆镇以西，离大型农场场址最近的一个火车站福利屯，是接收苏联人民赠送的农业机器和设备的地方。在这里，供苏联专家和我国工作人员居住、办公的房屋和停放机器的处所，现在已经修缮完了。四个星期前，负责准备房屋的工作人员来到这里的时候，除了一封介绍信外，什么都没有。当地的建筑工人工会立刻动员许多工人，紧张地开始修缮房屋。集贤县地方国营铁工厂厂长带领工人日夜工作，在苏联专家居住、办公的房屋内安装了暖气等设备。当地国营煤业建筑器材公司也简化手续，充足地供应了修缮需用的材料。
