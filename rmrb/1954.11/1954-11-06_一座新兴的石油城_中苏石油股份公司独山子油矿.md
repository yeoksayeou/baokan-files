    An Emerging Oil City
    — Dushanzi Oil Mine of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company
    Lù Niàn
    On the edge of the Junggar Basin in the northwest of the motherland, near the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, which are covered with snow all year round, lies a light yellow mountain ridge. Steel derricks stand everywhere on the mountain. In the mountain depressions, rows of neat, huge oil storage tanks reflect silver light in the sunlight. Red lead-roofed buildings stretch along the hillside far into the desolate desert. On the crisscrossing roads, cars and tractors run day and night. At night, the lights all over the mountains twinkle like stars in the night sky. This modern city in the Gobi Desert is Dushanzi Oil Mine, one of the largest enterprises of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company.
    When the company was established in October 1950, there were only dozens of dilapidated low houses; the entire mine had only two or three oil wells, and oil extraction was done by using buckets to hoist from the wells, which was inefficient and yielded little. The oil refining methods were also very backward, and the main product was kerosene for lighting. At that time, the newly built and renovated factories in various parts of Xinjiang needed oil, and transportation also needed oil, and the demand was increasing day by day. However, the oil refined by the mine was far from meeting the needs of production and construction. Without machinery and equipment and lacking technical personnel, how could the power resources buried underground be extracted and brought into full play? It was in this most difficult time that the Soviet government extended a helping hand and co-founded the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company with our country, continuously shipping in new equipment and machines, and sending many outstanding technical experts, solving the difficulties of funds and technology. Soon, steel derricks stood at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, which shone with silver light, and drilling work began, marching towards the ancient rock formations. At first, the workers were unfamiliar with the drilling rig and accidents easily happened, but these difficulties were overcome with the help of Soviet experts.
    One cold night in the spring of the year before last, Well No. 44 finally reached the oil layer after more than half a year of intense work. Soviet expert Asdarakhan Nikolai, who led the drilling of this well, had not been home to sleep for a week. That night, he was directing the workers on the platform to complete the final task of oil production - lifting the drill pipe. Because the workers lifting the drill pipe were not skilled, mud suddenly gushed from the wellhead. Comrade Asdarakhan immediately threw off his old sheepskin coat and ran to the platform to try to close the blowout preventer. However, the gas from the bottom of the well, carrying crude oil and mud, roared out of the wellhead like a torrent from a burst dike, rushing to a height of thirty or forty meters. In the darkness, nothing could be seen clearly below the platform, and they had to return to the workroom. The roar of crude oil and gas pierced the quiet night sky. Hearing this sound, Comrade Asdarakhan anxiously said, "How much crude oil will be lost! If this continues for a long time, it will collapse the well." Without waiting for dawn, he ran out to see time and time again. At six o'clock in the morning, Comrade Asdarakhan climbed under the platform again to study solutions. At this time, the Soviet general manager and chief engineer also came and climbed down to the platform. The crude oil and mud spewing from the wellhead hit their faces like a storm. The gas suffocated people's breathing. Soon, they were fainted by the gas, and the workers quickly climbed in and helped them out. After resting for a while, Comrade Asdarakhan climbed in again to work. He thought, "This is the first oil well I have drilled in China, and I must not let it collapse." At nine o'clock in the evening, this young Soviet expert finally overcame the gas and closed the blowout preventer. When he finally climbed out from under the platform, his clothes were soaked with mud and crude oil, his eyes were red and swollen from the gas, and his throat was hoarse, but his face was filled with the joy of victory.
    The selfless labor of Soviet experts inspired the enthusiasm of Chinese workers for learning and work. New technical forces are growing rapidly. In the famous youth drilling team, there is a female diesel engine worker named Aizihan (Uyghur), who was selected as a labor model twice this year on May Day and National Day. When people see her dexterous movements of pressing the button and pulling the throttle lever while working on the well, they would never think that this skilled worker was an illiterate housewife a year ago. For a person without culture and technical knowledge, it takes perseverance and a spirit of overcoming difficulties to learn technology well. In order to learn Russian, she went to bed late and got up early, squeezing out her rest time. As soon as she learned some theory, she immediately took it to the construction site to practice. When she encountered problems, she always asked clearly. With the patient help of Soviet experts, she understood the structure and performance of diesel engines and mastered the operating technology of diesel engines. On the day she was officially promoted to diesel engine worker, she excitedly said, "I never dreamed that women who were not treated as human beings in the old society could master such complex machines in the new society. In order to build the motherland into a socialist society as soon as possible, I must work harder and learn from Soviet experts."
    With the development of drilling work, the oil production is rising rapidly. In order to improve the oil refining rate, the cracking plant was started in the mining area last year. After more than a year of intense work, the cracking plant was officially put into production in May this year. This cracking plant is a completely new and automated factory. In the workshop, you can see the electrically controlled workbench, and the workers stand in front of the table, operating the buttons to control the machines. If something goes wrong with that part, the signal light will immediately report to the master of the machine. But mastering such complex machines is not an easy task. In order to train our country's technical talents, Soviet experts organized a technical training class. At the beginning, Chief Engineer Markriyan squeezed out his rest time to teach the students himself. Workshop Director Mikhailov disassembled each part of the machine for the learners to see, teaching them once and twice. When he didn't understand the language, he gestured and drew sketches, trying every means to teach the learning comrades. In this way, many young students who had just left school became specialized talents who mastered new machines in a short period of time.
    This factory was designed by Soviet experts according to the latest Soviet standards. All kinds of machinery and equipment were shipped from the Soviet Union. Many machines were only made in 1953. For example, the high-temperature and high-pressure turbine centrifugal pump, one of the main machines of the cracking plant, is the latest product of the Soviet Union. The Soviet factory that produced the centrifugal pump also sent an expert to help install it. As soon as this expert arrived in China, he said: "Not only is installation my task, but I must also teach Chinese comrades how to operate and repair it."
    While building a new cracking plant, Dushanzi Oil Mine also improved the production situation of the distillation plant. The distillation plant was originally an old factory, and adding oil and loading finished product tanks were all done manually. Some comrades believed that these equipments were not very useful and it would be better to simply abandon them. Comrade Markriyan firmly opposed this view, believing that it should be refitted to increase its oil refining capacity. As a result, under the guidance of the advanced ideas of Soviet experts, the original equipment was used for three refitting works, and the oil refining capacity was increased twelve times, which was almost as efficient as the new plant.
    The appearance of Dushanzi is becoming more and more lovely day by day. Tall poplar trees have grown on the wide road from the office building to the refinery; the small garden cultivated last year is blooming with bright flowers this year. Hospitals, nurseries, schools, and movie theaters have been established one after another. The forty newly built dormitories this year were completed before National Day. Flat and wide roads have been built on both sides of the dormitory, and small gardens will be cultivated in the middle of the dormitory. Recently, workers are busy moving into the newly built dormitories. Most of the dormitories are also equipped with radios, broadcasting pleasant music and production news from all over the country every day. In a few years, there will be more oil wells, factories and houses here, and millions of trees will be planted, and the entire Dushanzi will become a green garden.
    Dushanzi has grown into a modern oil city. When we see countless vehicles loaded with oil drums, heading towards the golden-red morning sun, galloping on the misty Gobi Desert, transporting gasoline to distant factories and mines, to newly reclaimed collective farms on the grassland, and to the soldiers guarding the Pamir Plateau, we feel unspeakable joy in our hearts. Especially, we cannot help but express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and experts who helped us with the construction.

    一座新兴的石油城
    ——中苏石油股份公司独山子油矿
    陆念
    在祖国西北部准噶尔盆地的边缘，临近终年积雪的天山麓下，有一座浅黄色的山岗。山上到处矗立着钢铁井架。山凹里，一排整齐的巨大的储油罐，在太阳光下闪映着银色的光辉。红色铅皮顶的楼房，沿着山坡，一直伸到远远的荒漠中去。纵横交错的马路上，日日夜夜地奔驰着汽车、拖拉机。夜晚，满山遍地的电灯，像星星在夜空中一样闪烁着。这座戈壁滩上的近代化的城市，就是中苏石油股份公司最大企业之一的独山子油矿。
    一九五○年十月公司成立时，这里只有几十间门窗破烂的矮房子；全矿只有两、三口油井，采油是用桶到井里去吊，效率低、产量少。炼油的方法也很落后，主要的产品是照明用的煤油。当时新疆各地新建和改建的工厂需要油，交通运输也需要油，而需要量一天比一天在增加着。但是矿上提炼出来的油，远远不能满足生产建设的需要。没有机器设备，缺乏技术人才，怎样把埋藏在地下的动力资源采掘出来，发挥它的巨大效用呢？就在这最困难的时候，苏联政府伸出了援助的手，和我国合办了中苏石油股份公司，源源不断地运到了新式的设备和机器，派来了许多优秀的技术专家，解决了资金和技术的困难。不久，在白雪闪着银光的天山脚下，竖起了钢铁井架，开始钻探工作，向古老的岩层进军。起初，工人们对钻机是陌生的，也容易发生事故，但这些困难都在苏联专家帮助下克服了。
    前年春天的一个严寒的夜晚。四十四号井经过半年多的紧张工作后，终于钻到了油层。领导钻这口井的苏联专家阿斯大拉汉·尼古拉同志已经有一个星期没有回家睡觉了。这天夜里，他正在井台上指挥工人完成出油的最后一件工作——提钻杆的时候，因为提钻杆的工人技术不熟练，井口突然冒出泥浆来。阿斯大拉汉同志马上扔掉身上的老羊皮袄，跑到井台下去，想关住防喷器。可是井底的瓦斯带着原油和泥浆，像一条决堤的巨流，从井口呼啸而出，直冲到三、四十公尺的高空。在黑夜里，井台下面一点也看不清楚，他们只得回到工作房去。原油和瓦斯的呼啸声划破了宁静的夜空。阿斯大拉汉同志听到这种声音，焦急地说：“这要损失多少原油！时间长了会冲垮这口井的。”他不等到天明，
  一次又一次地跑出去看。清晨六点钟，阿斯大拉汉同志又爬进井台下，研究处理办法。这时苏方总经理和总工程师都来了，他们也爬到井台下去。井口喷出的原油和泥浆，像狂风暴雨，打在他们的脸上。瓦斯窒息着人们的呼吸。不久，他们就被瓦斯熏昏了，工人赶快爬进去把他们扶出来。休息了一会，阿斯大拉汉同志又爬进去工作。他想：“这是我在中国钻出来的第一口油井，我决不能让它垮了。”晚上九点钟，这位年青的苏联专家终于战胜了瓦斯，关住了防喷器。当他最后一次从井台下爬出来时，泥浆和原油已经浸透了全身衣服，眼睛被瓦斯熏得又红又肿，嗓子都哑了，但在他的脸上洋溢着胜利的喜悦。
    苏联专家忘我的劳动，鼓舞着中国职工学习和工作的热情。新的技术力量在迅速成长。在著名的青年钻井队里，有一位在今年“五一”和国庆节两次被选为劳动模范的女柴油机工艾孜罕（维吾尔族），人们看见她在井上工作时按电钮、拉动油门把手的灵巧动作，决不会想到这样熟练的技术工人，一年前还是一个不识字的家庭妇女。一个没有文化不懂技术的人，要想学好技术是需要毅力和克服困难的精神的。为了学俄文，她迟睡早起，挤出自己的休息时间来。学到一点理论，就立刻带到工地上去实习。遇到了问题，总是要问清楚。在苏联专家的耐心帮助下，她了解了柴油机的构造和性能，掌握了柴油机的操纵技术。当她正式被提升为柴油机工的那一天，她兴奋地说：“做梦也想不到在旧社会不被当人看的妇女，在新社会能够掌握这样复杂的机器。为了把祖国早日建设成社会主义社会，我一定要加倍努力向苏联专家学习。”
    随着钻井工作的开展，采油量在飞速上升着。为了提高炼油率，去年矿区里又开始建立裂化厂。经过一年多来的紧张工作，裂化厂已在今年五月正式投入生产了。这座裂化厂完全是新式的自动化的工厂。在车间里，你可以看到电气操纵的工作台，工人站在台前，操纵电钮指挥机器。如果那一部分出了毛病，信号灯马上会向掌握机器的主人报告。但是要掌握这样复杂的机器，并不是一件容易的事情。苏联专家为了培养我国的技术人才，组织了一个技术学习班。一开始，总工程师马尔克里扬同志就挤出自己的休息时间，亲自给学员讲课。车间主任米哈依诺夫同志把机器的每一零件拆给学习的人看，一遍两遍地教。言语不通他就比手势、画草图，想尽各种办法教会学习的同志。这样，使许多刚出学校不久的青年学生，在短期内就成了掌握新式机器的专门人才。
    这座工厂是苏联专家按苏联最新标准设计出来的。各种机器设备，全部是从苏联运来。很多机器都是一九五三年才制成的。如裂化厂主要机械之一的高温高压透平离心泵，就是苏联最新的出品。生产离心泵的苏联工厂还专门派了一位专家来帮助安装。这位专家一到中国就表示：“不但安装是我的任务，而且还必须教会中国同志操作和修理。”
    在建立新的裂化厂的同时，独山子油矿还改进了蒸馏厂的生产情况。蒸馏厂本来是一间又老又旧的工厂，炼油时加油料、装成品罐，都用人工来进行。有的同志认为这些设备作用不大，不如干脆废弃的好。马尔克里扬同志坚决反对这种意见，认为应该改装它，提高它的炼油量。结果，在苏联专家先进思想的指导下，利用原有设备，进行了三次改装工作，炼油量提高了十二倍，效率和新厂差不多。
    独山子的面貌一天比一天地显得更加可爱了。从办公大楼通向炼油厂的广阔的马路上，已经长起了高大的白杨树；去年才培育起来的小花园，今年开着鲜艳的花朵。医院、托儿所、学校、电影场都先后建立起来了。今年新建的四十栋宿舍，在国庆节前都已完工。宿舍两旁修起了又平坦又广阔的马路，宿舍中间都将培植起小花园来。最近，工人们正忙着搬向新建的宿舍里去。大多数的宿舍还装上了收音机，每天播送着愉快的音乐和各地的生产消息。再过几年，这儿会出现更多的油井、工厂和房舍，也要种上成百万株树木，整个独山子将变成绿化园地。
    独山子已经成长为一座近代化的石油城市了。当我们每天看见无数的车辆载着油桶，迎着金红色的朝霞，奔驰在雾蒙蒙的戈壁滩上，把汽油运送给远方的工厂和矿山时，运送给草原上新开垦的集体农庄时，运送给守卫在帕米尔高原上的战士们时，心里真有说不出的喜悦。尤其是不能不对帮助我们建设的苏联政府和专家们表示衷心的感激。
