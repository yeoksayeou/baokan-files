    Guaranteeing the Smooth Progress of Grain Unified Purchase and Sales
    Lingling County People's Court Sentences Arsonist Deng Zhenzhong to Death
    On September 8th, the Fourth Circuit Tribunal of the Lingling County People's Court in Hunan Province held a mass meeting in Lingjiaotang Township, Sixth District, attended by people from the four neighboring townships. They publicly pronounced judgment on a counter-revolutionary case involving arson to sabotage the unified purchase and sale of grain, a conspiracy to rob grain, and the murder of township cadres.
    The main culprit, Deng Zhenzhong, was a rogue ex-soldier. After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, he incited and colluded with Deng Xinru, Deng Guyu, and Deng Jianjun to carry out sabotage activities. Deng Zhenzhong told them, "We are restricted in how much grain we can buy, so we have to find a way to set fire to houses. When they (referring to cadres and the masses) come out to put out the fire, we'll go and rob the grain." At the same time, Deng and the others also conspired to kill the chairman of the township farmers' association and the secretary of the township people's government, seize guns, and stage an armed riot. Under Deng Zhenzhong's manipulation, the criminals committed arson and sabotage four times in a row from July 1st to 5th. While setting the fires, the criminals also distributed reactionary leaflets twice to intimidate the masses, seriously affecting the over-production campaign in Lingjiaotang Township.
    In order to resolutely crack down on saboteurs, guarantee the implementation of the policy of unified grain purchase and sales, and ensure the smooth progress of the increased production campaign, the Lingling County Public Security Bureau, after cracking the above-mentioned case, filed a public prosecution with the Lingling County People's Court in accordance with the law. The Lingling County People's Court has sentenced the unrepentant criminal Deng Zhenzhong to death and sentenced the criminal Deng Xinru, who colluded in organizing the arson, to ten years in prison. The accomplices Deng Jianjun and Deng Guyu were induced by the main culprit Deng Zhenzhong to participate, and were willing to confess and repent afterwards, so they were treated leniently. Deng Jianjun was released after education, and Deng Guyu was exempted from prosecution. After the above verdicts were read out at the meeting, Deng Zhenzhong was executed on the spot. The masses attending the meeting unanimously supported the people's government's judgment.

    保障粮食统购统销工作顺利进行
    零陵县人民法院判处纵火犯邓振忠死刑
    湖南省零陵县人民法院第四巡回法庭九月八日在六区菱角塘乡举行了邻近四个乡的群众大会，公开宣判了一件纵火破坏粮食统购统销、阴谋抢劫粮食和杀害乡干部的反革命案件。
    首犯邓振忠是一个兵痞流氓，在国家实行粮食统购统销以后，他煽动和勾结邓新孺、邓谷雨、邓建军三人进行破坏活动。邓振忠对他们说：“我们多买粮食都要受限制，得想个办法放火烧屋，等他们（指干部和群众）出来救火时，我们就去抢粮。”同时，邓犯等还阴谋杀害乡农民协会主席和乡人民政府秘书，劫取枪枝，武装暴乱。在邓犯振忠的操纵下，罪犯们于七月一日至五日曾连续四次纵火破坏，在放火的同时，罪犯们又两次散发反动传单，威吓群众，严重地影响了菱角塘乡的超额增产运动。
    为了坚决打击破坏分子，保障粮食统购统销政策的贯彻和增产运动的顺利进行，零陵县公安局破获上述案件后，依法向零陵县人民法院提起公诉。零陵县人民法院已判处怙恶不悛的罪犯邓振忠死刑，判处伙同组织纵火的罪犯邓新孺十年徒刑。从犯邓建军、邓谷雨两人，系首犯邓振忠诱哄参加，事后肯坦白悔过，从宽处理，邓犯建军教育释放，邓犯谷雨免予追究。以上判决在会上宣读后，邓犯振忠当场伏法，到会群众一致拥护人民政府的判决。
