The agricultural technology extension stations in Qinghai Province, using agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as bases, have promoted more than 2,000 new-style walking plows, repaired and re-fitted 1,170 new-style walking plows, and supplied farmers with more than 618,000 jin of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides this year. They also held short-term training courses, enabling 13,500 rural cadres and farmers to learn various techniques.

Now, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government plans to further promote new-style animal-powered farm implements next year, requiring that each agricultural production cooperative in the irrigated areas have one to two double-wheeled double-furrow plows or double-wheeled single-furrow plows next year, and to expand the planting area of improved varieties such as "Biyu Wheat."

    青海省各农业技术推广站工作有成绩
    今年青海省各地农业技术推广站以农业生产合作社、互助组为基点，共推广新式步犁两千多部，修配新式步犁一千一百七十部，供应农民良种、化学肥料、农药等六十一万八千多斤，并举办了短期训练班，使一万三千五百名农村干部和农民学会了各种技术。
    现在，青海省人民政府计划明年进一步推广新式畜力农具，要求作到明年川水地区每个农业生产合作社都有一部到二部双轮双铧犁或双轮单铧犁，并扩大“碧玉麦”等良种的种植面积。　　（新华社）
