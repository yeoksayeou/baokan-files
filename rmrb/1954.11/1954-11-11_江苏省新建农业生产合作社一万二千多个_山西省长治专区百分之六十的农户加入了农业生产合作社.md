Jiangsu Province Establishes Over 12,000 New Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, Sees 60% of Farmers Join Agricultural Production Cooperatives

This autumn, Jiangsu Province has achieved certain successes in the development of agricultural production cooperatives. By the end of October, more than 12,500 new agricultural production cooperatives had been established throughout the province. It is expected that another 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives can be established by the end of November. The establishment work in various regions has been prepared for a long time, and the province has trained more than 66,000 key personnel for establishing cooperatives. Through these key personnel, education has been carried out among the broad masses, and development work has been carried out on the premise of voluntary participation of the masses. While developing new cooperatives, the old cooperatives have also been appropriately expanded, which has promoted the development and improvement of mutual aid teams.

At present, all regions have generally paid attention to the consolidation of newly developed agricultural production cooperatives. The Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred 110 cadres from the entire area to go deep into the new cooperatives to inspect and assist in their work. The Huaiyin Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of the heads of the Production Cooperation Departments of the county committees, requiring them to start with production inspections, establish labor organizations, and formulate production plans for this winter and next spring, and earnestly do a good job in current production work; and to continuously educate the members to improve their socialist consciousness. At the same time, it is required to improve the leadership of the county and district committees, establish organizations for mutual assistance and cooperation in districts and townships, and reorganize and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations through the current unified purchase and sale work.

Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, has achieved great success in developing agricultural production cooperatives before and after the autumn harvest. At present, the number of cooperatives in the region has increased from 4,035 to 7,600. Together with the number of households expanded in the old cooperatives, the proportion of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives to the total number of farmers has increased from 20.2 percent to nearly 60 percent.

Of the original 4,035 agricultural production cooperatives in the region, 85 percent achieved bumper harvests this year. Although more than 400 cooperatives suffered varying degrees of production reduction due to natural disasters or poor management, they generally exceeded the production level of farmers outside the cooperatives in the local area. Under the influence of the increased production of agricultural production cooperatives, the broad masses of farmers actively demanded to take the road of collectivization, and more than 22,000 mutual aid teams and nearly 400,000 farm households have signed up to join the cooperatives one after another.

In order to welcome the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, through various forms of connection between various cooperatives and groups in various productions since the beginning of spring, has planned to cultivate cooperative establishment targets, and formulated plans for developing cooperatives after the autumn harvest from the bottom up, reversing the generalized leadership style of the cadres, and creating fully favorable conditions for the great development of agricultural production cooperatives in terms of ideology, organization, key personnel training and other aspects.

Of the more than 3,560 newly developed agricultural production cooperatives in the region, 2,150 cooperatives have formulated current production plans, divided labor organizations, and generally stipulated labor discipline, and have been collectively involved in production activities such as wheat sowing, autumn plowing, and fertilizer accumulation in an orderly manner.

    江苏省新建农业生产合作社一万二千多个
    山西省长治专区百分之六十的农户加入了农业生产合作社
    今年秋季江苏省发展农业生产合作社的工作已获得一定的成绩。到十月底为止，全省新建立了一万二千五百多个农业生产合作社，预计到十一月底可以继续建立八千个农业生产合作社，各地的建社工作都经过较长时间的准备，全省训练了六万六千多个建社骨干。通过骨干，向广大群众进行了教育，在群众自愿参加的前提下，展开了发展工作。在发展新社的同时，老社也有适当的扩大，并带动了互助组的发展和提高。
    目前各地已普遍注意到新发展的农业生产合作社的巩固问题。中共盐城地委已从全区抽调了一百一十个干部深入新社检查和帮助工作。淮阴地委召开了各县委生产合作部部长会议，要求从检查生产着手，建立劳动组织，订好今冬明春的生产计划，切实做好当前的生产工作；并不断对社员进行教育，提高社会主义觉悟。同时要求改进县区委领导，建立区乡互助合作等的组织，通过目前统购统销工作，整理和提高互助合作组织。

    山西省长治专区秋收前后发展农业生产合作社工作，已获得巨大成绩。目前全区已由四千零三十五个社，发展到七千六百个；连同老社扩大的户数，参加农业生产合作社农户占农户总数的比例，已由百分之二十点二，增加到近百分之六十。
    全区原有四千零三十五个农业生产合作社，今年百分之八十五的社获得丰产，其余四百多个社虽因遭受自然灾害袭击，或因经营管理不好而造成不同程度的减产，但一般也超过当地社外农民的生产水平。在农业生产合作社增产的影响下，广大农民积极要求走合作化的道路，先后报名入社的就有两万二千多个互助组，近四十万农户。
    中共长治地委为迎接农业合作化运动的高潮，在入春以来的各种生产中，通过各种社组之间的联系形式，有计划地培养建社对象，并自下而上的制订了秋后发展社的计划，扭转了干部中一般化的领导作风，从思想上、组织上、骨干培养和训练等各方面，为农业生产合作社大发展创造了充分有利条件。
    全区新发展的三千五百六十多个农业生产合作社，其中有二千一百五十个社已订出当前生产计划，划分了劳动组织，大体规定出劳动纪律，有秩序地集体投入种麦、秋耕、积肥等生产活动。
