    Strengthen the Management and Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine

    Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Chinese medicine are inextricably linked and share a similarly long history. There are numerous varieties of Chinese medicines, and they are backed by centuries of clinical experience. Therefore, they enjoy high prestige among the broad masses of working people in our country. Approximately 80% of the total population in China uses TCM for treatment. Foreign medical circles also attach great importance to Chinese medicinal materials, conduct serious research, and have achieved many results. The remarkable efficacy of many TCMs has not only been proven by long-term clinical experience but also by the conclusions of modern scientific research. For example, it is well known that berberine and Brucea javanica are used to treat dysentery, Quisqualis indica and betel nuts are used to expel parasites, Angelica sinensis and motherwort are used to treat gynecological diseases, and Dichroa febrifuga is used to combat malaria.

    However, our country's health departments and other relevant parties have not paid enough attention to TCM, just like they have not paid enough attention to Chinese medicine. The production, supply, sales, and research of TCM are basically in a state of laissez-faire, and many problems exist. In order to promote the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and improve the level of medical and healthcare work, how to systematically and gradually improve the situation of TCM has become an important issue at present.

    The main problem in the current TCM industry is the continuous soaring of drug prices. According to incomplete statistics of eleven major medicinal materials in Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, if the average price in 1950 is 100, it rose to 143 in 1952 and 356 in 1954. According to a survey of the Tianjin TCM market, from June 1950 to February 1953, among more than 20 major medicinal materials, the prices of 15 types increased by one to six times, four types increased by seven times, and one type each increased by nine, twelve, and eighteen times. This greatly restricts people's ability to purchase and take TCM, which affects the development of Chinese medicine services. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly because there is a lack of necessary planning and guidance for the production of TCM, and a lack of necessary leadership and management for the TCM market. The source of many TCMs has decreased, and the supply cannot meet the demand. A small number of important TCMs are in a state of extreme shortage. Illegal private merchants take the opportunity to manipulate prices and seek exorbitant profits. The phenomenon of substituting inferior products for good ones and fake products for genuine ones is very serious in some valuable drugs. This backward state of the TCM industry is inseparable from the fact that the leading departments concerned despise TCM and do not care about the TCM industry. Strengthening the unified leadership and management of the state over the production and marketing of TCM is the key to overcoming the backwardness and chaos in the TCM industry.

    TCM is divided into two types: cultivated and wild. Wild varieties are mostly produced in remote mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. After farmers were allocated land, their living conditions gradually improved, and fewer people went up the mountains to dig for medicinal herbs. Before liberation, most of the medicinal fields were controlled by landlords. After the land reform, many farmers changed to growing grains on the original medicinal fields because growing medicinal herbs often could not be harvested in the current year, which affected living expenses. The erroneous idea that growing medicinal herbs is an illegitimate production and collecting medicinal herbs is a backward sideline occupation also affected the farmers' enthusiasm for growing and collecting medicinal herbs. More importantly, there is no unified leadership for the production and sales of TCM, and it is left to blind laissez-faire. In response to the above situation, it is very necessary to take effective measures, strengthen planning, and appropriately encourage the planting and collection of medicinal herbs according to needs and possibilities. We should now consider using loans, advance purchases, and other methods to solve the practical difficulties of medicinal farmers; medicinal producing areas should organize the masses to go up the mountains to collect medicinal herbs, and lead forestry workers to use their leisure time to carry out the sideline production of medicinal herb collection under the conditions that do not hinder forest protection and fire prevention work, and protect the interests of medicinal farmers with reasonable purchase prices. Agricultural, forestry, commercial, and other departments should formulate practical and feasible methods based on the actual situation.

    According to surveys of some TCM markets, some TCMs are not in short supply, but prices have still soared, mainly due to the illegal speculation of some private merchants. In the past, there was a lack of special management agencies for TCM, and the China Native Produce Company concurrently operated the business, which was unable to uniformly control the market; the connection between state-owned companies and cooperatives was not close enough, and TCM prices were inconsistent; there were also uncoordinated phenomena in domestic and foreign trade plans; some units often showed a purely profit-seeking capitalist management ideology in their business; some personnel who went out for purchasing and sales did not respect the leadership of local companies enough, and often acted independently, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as competing for purchases and selling off at reduced prices; there were no effective methods for dealing with fake and inferior drugs. All this has created gaps for the speculative activities of a group of illegal elements in private commerce. In order to strengthen the leadership and management of the TCM market, the commercial department is preparing to establish a special TCM management agency and clearly stipulate the management policy, which is very necessary. In the future, it should actively lead and organize the acquisition and supply of TCM, promote the development of TCM production in a planned way, stabilize TCM prices, rationally adjust drug prices on the basis of increased TCM production, and take appropriate measures to prevent the sale of fake and inferior drugs. Doing so is not only necessary but also entirely possible. The stability and reasonableness of drug prices in the Western medicine industry due to strengthened leadership and management over the past few years is a remarkable example.

    In order to improve the academic level and actual curative effect of Chinese medicine, it is necessary to strengthen the scientific research work of TCM. The purpose of studying TCM is to provide a scientific theoretical explanation for the efficacy of TCM so as to better grasp the properties of drugs, ensure the accuracy of prescriptions, and discover new effects from existing drugs in order to enrich the content of pharmacy and improve the level of pharmacy.

    In the past, as a result of the health leading department's neglect of TCM, the scientific research work of TCM, like that of Chinese medicine, lacked a correct guiding principle, research institutions were unsound, research forces were not concentrated, and there were problems with research directions and methods. In the past, research on TCM often did not start from actual curative effects, ignored the characteristics and complexity of TCM prescriptions, and only used simple analysis and testing methods to judge whether it had value, resulting in the rash negation of some TCMs with significant curative effects. This is a concrete manifestation of the erroneous psychology of despising TCM. Some people also separate TCM from Chinese medicine, believing that TCM is worth studying, but Chinese medicine is not worth studying, thus ignoring the importance of studying TCM from the Chinese medicine's methods of using drugs, ignoring the importance of clinical experience, and ignoring the necessity of absorbing Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in research work. They only put effort into test tubes, and as a result, they cannot comprehensively recognize the role and value of TCM. Scientific analysis and testing are completely necessary, but they must be closely combined with clinical experience. First, the value of TCM must be measured based on clinical efficacy. Health authorities and relevant scientific research institutions and medical schools should cooperate closely to carry out this research work, and Chinese and Western medicine practitioners should jointly conduct repeated observation and research, and strive to explore scientific basis; all drugs that have actual curative effects but cannot be analyzed and tested for a while should be retained and should not be arbitrarily denied in order to continue research.

    Strengthening the scientific research work of TCM has a significant role in improving the dosage forms. Improving dosage forms is urgently required by all parties; however, this is a very arduous task, and a very cautious attitude must be adopted; otherwise, the actual curative effect may be affected due to changes in dosage forms. The work of improving dosage forms should be carried out on the basis of scientific research on TCM. We must pay close attention to the complexity of the role of TCM, carefully study the chemical and physical changes that occur in the refining process of TCM, and prudently prepare new types of drugs. This also requires the full cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and other experts. In the past, the health leading department rarely led and supervised this work, and it must be effectively improved.

    In order to strengthen the management and research of TCM, the relevant leading departments must closely cooperate under the unified leadership of the Party, clarify the situation, formulate improvement plans, and earnestly implement them.

    加强对中药的管理和研究工作
    中药跟中医有不可分割的联系，有同样悠久的历史。中药的品种极多，而且有千百年的临床经验的证明，因此，它在我国广大劳动人民中是很有威信的，全国用中药治病的约占总人口百分之八十。外国医学界对我国生药也很重视，认真进行研究，取得了不少成果。许多中药的显著功效，不但为长期的临床经验所证明，而且为现代科学研究的结论所证明。例如黄连素、鸦胆子治痢疾，使君子、槟榔驱虫，当归、益母草治妇科病，常山抗疟等等，是人所共知的。
    但是，我国卫生部门和其他有关方面对于中药，和对于中医一样，没有加以重视，中药的生产、供销和研究等工作基本上处于自流状态，存在着不少问题。为了发扬祖国医药遗产、提高医疗保健工作的水平，如何有计划地逐步改进中药方面的状况，就成为当前的一个重要的问题。
    当前中药业方面的主要问题，集中地表现在药价的不断暴涨上。根据重庆、上海、广州等地十一种主要药材的不完全统计，如一九五○年平均价格为一○○，一九五二年就上涨到一四三，一九五四年上涨到三五六。根据天津中药市场的调查，从一九五○年六月到一九五三年二月，在二十多种主要药材中，药价上涨一倍至六倍的有十五种，上涨七倍的有四种，上涨九倍、十二倍、十八倍的各一种。这就大大限制了人民购服中药的能力，影响了中医业务的发展。这种现象之所以产生，主要是因为对中药的生产工作缺乏应有的计划和指导，对中药市场缺乏必要的领导和管理。不少中药货源减小，供不应求，少数重要中药处于奇缺状态。而不法私商乘机操纵，猎取暴利。某些贵重药品以劣代优、以假代真的现象十分严重。中药业的这种落后状况，是跟各有关领导部门轻视中医药的思想和不关心中药业的态度分不开的。加强国家对中药的生产和供销工作的统一领导和管理，乃是克服中药业的落后、混乱现象的关键所在。
    中药分为家种和野生两种。野生品种大都产于交通不便的偏僻山区，农民分得土地之后，生活状况逐渐改善，上山挖药的逐渐减少。药田在解放前大都为地主所掌握，而土地改革后的农民，因为种药往往不能在当年收获，影响生活费用，在原来的药田上改种谷物的很多。而认为种药是不正当的生产、采药是落后的副业等错误思想，也影响了农民种药、采药的情绪。而更重要的问题是对中药的产销没有统一的领导，任其盲目自流。针对上述情况，根据需要和可能，采取有效措施，加强计划性，适当鼓励种药和采药是非常必要的。现在应该考虑用贷款、预购等办法来解决药农的实际困难；产药区应组织群众上山挖药，领导林业工人在不妨碍护林和防火工作的条件下，利用休闲时间进行采药的副业生产，并用合理的收购价格来保障药农的利益。农、林、商业等部门应根据实际情况，订出切实可行的办法来。
    根据某些中药市场的调查，有些中药并不缺货，而价格同样暴涨，这主要是由于部分私商违法投机倒把的缘故。过去中药方面缺乏专管机构，由中国土产公司兼营业务，无力统一掌握市场；而国营公司和合作社的联系不够密切，中药价格不一致；国内外贸易计划也有不衔接的现象；有些单位又往往在业务上表现出单纯追求利润的资本主义经营思想；有些外出采购推销的人员对当地公司的领导尊重不够，往往各自为政，发生争购、削价脱售等不合理现象；对于假药、劣药也没有规定有效的处理的办法。这一切都给私营商业中的一部分不法分子的投机活动造成空隙。为了加强对中药市场的领导和管理，商业部门正在筹备设立中药专管机构，明确规定经营方针，这是十分必要的，今后应积极领导和组织中药的收购和供销工作，有计划地促进中药生产的发展，稳定中药价格，在中药增产的基础上合理调整药价，并采取妥善办法防止假药、劣药的销行。这样做，非但必要，而且完全可能。西药业由于加强领导和管理的结果，几年来药价稳定合理，就是一个显著的例证。
    为了提高中医的学术水平和实际疗效，必须加强对中药的科学研究工作。研究中药的目的是要使中药的疗效得到科学的理论说明，以便更好地掌握药性，保证处方用药的准确性，并从现有的药物中发现新的效用，以丰富药学内容，提高药学水平。
    过去由于卫生领导部门轻视中医药的结果，中药和中医的科学研究工作一样，没有正确的领导方针，研究机构不健全，研究力量不集中，研究的方针和方法都有问题。过去研究中药往往不从实际疗效出发，忽视中医处方用药的特点和复杂性，只用简单的分析、化验的方法来判断它有无价值，结果对某些有显著疗效的中药，也轻率地加以否定。这是轻视中药的错误心理的具体表现。也有些人把中药同中医截然分开，认为中药值得研究，而中医却不值得研究，因而忽视从中医的用药方法来研究中药的重要性，忽视临床经验的重要性，忽视吸收中医参加研究工作的必要性。他们只在试验管里用功夫，结果就无法全面认识中药的作用和价值。科学的分析和化验是完全必要的，但必须紧紧结合临床经验，首先要根据临床实效来衡量中药的价值。卫生机关和有关的科学研究机构及医药学校应该密切合作，进行这种研究工作，并由中西医共同反复进行观察研究，努力探求科学根据；凡有实际疗效而一时不能分析化验出来的药物，都应加以保留，不应武断地加以否定，以便继续研究。
    加强中药的科学研究工作，对于改进剂型的工作，有重大的作用。改进剂型是各方面所迫切要求的；但这是非常繁重的工作，必须采取十分慎重的态度，否则就容易因剂型的改变而影响实际的疗效。应该在中药的科学研究的基础上进行改进剂型的工作，要十分注意中药作用的复杂性，要仔细研究中药在制炼过程中所发生的化学的和物理的变化，审慎地配制新型药剂。这同样就需要中、西医和其他各方面专家的通力合作。过去卫生领导部门对这项工作很少领导监督，必须切实加以改进。
    为了加强对中药的管理和研究工作，各有关领导部门必须在党的统一领导下紧密配合，弄清情况，订出改进计划，切实执行。
