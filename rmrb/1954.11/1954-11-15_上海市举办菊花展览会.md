    Shanghai Holds Chrysanthemum Exhibition
    The 1954 Shanghai Chrysanthemum Exhibition opened at the People's Park on the 10th. On the first day, there were more than 59,000 visitors.
    This year's Chrysanthemum Exhibition is the largest one Shanghai has ever held. The exhibition includes exhibition halls for various types of chrysanthemums, large-scale chrysanthemums, famous chrysanthemums, chrysanthemum bonsai, a cliff chrysanthemum display area, as well as large chrysanthemum mountains, chrysanthemum pavilions, chrysanthemum towers, chrysanthemum bridges, and various patterns and slogans composed of chrysanthemums. There are more than 60,000 pots of chrysanthemums on display, with over 600 varieties, including more than 300 fine varieties.
    The essence of chrysanthemums is displayed in the Famous Chrysanthemum Exhibition Hall. Some are as fine as silk, some are as round as balls, and some are curled like whiskers. There is the "Green Lotus" that resembles a peony, the "Mandarin Duck" in purple and gold, the beautiful and graceful "Curtain Rolling in the West Wind", and the "Willow Thread," one of the top ten famous varieties in Yangzhou, which can bloom for two months continuously. In the Large-Scale Chrysanthemum Exhibition Hall, the largest standing chrysanthemum in Shanghai is displayed, with 217 chrysanthemums blooming on one stem, displayed like a peacock spreading its tail.
    Many foreign visitors who came to Shanghai also came to appreciate them. They greatly admired the world-famous Chinese chrysanthemums. A Soviet expert wrote in the suggestion book: "The Chinese people love life and flowers, and cherish the growth of flowers, therefore they cherish peace and friendship even more."

    上海市举办菊花展览会
    上海市一九五四年菊花展览会，十日起在人民公园展出。第一天观众有五万九千多人。
    今年的菊花展览会，是上海市历年来规模最大的一次。展览会设有品种菊、大立菊、名菊、菊花盆景等展览廊、悬崖菊布置区以及用菊花布置的大菊山、菊亭、菊塔、菊桥、用菊花组成的各种图案和标语等。展出的菊花共有六万多盆，品种达六百多种，其中精品有三百多种。
    在名菊展览廊里陈列着菊花中的精华。它们细的如丝，圆的如球，卷的如须。有像牡丹的“绿荷”，有紫金双色的“鸳鸯”和美妙多姿的“帘卷西风”，也有扬州十大名种之一的“柳线”，它可以连开两个月。在大立菊展览廊里，陈列着全上海最大的立菊，在它的一根花茎上可开二百十七朵菊花，它像孔雀开屏那样展现在人们眼前。
    许多来上海访问的外宾也来欣赏。他们对世界出名的中国菊花极为赞美。有一位苏联专家在意见簿上写着：中国人民因为热爱生活和花，热爱花的成长，因此也更珍爱和平和友谊。（新华社）
