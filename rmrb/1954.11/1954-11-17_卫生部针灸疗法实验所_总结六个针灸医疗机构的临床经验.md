Ministry of Health Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute
Summarizes Clinical Experience of Six Acupuncture Medical Institutions
(Xinhua News Agency)
The Ministry of Health Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute summarized the clinical experiences of six acupuncture medical institutions in October this year and gained a preliminary understanding of the indications for acupuncture therapy. The six institutions, namely the Ministry of Health Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute, the Acupuncture Clinic of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, the Acupuncture Training Class of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Health Cadre School, the Acupuncture Teacher Training Class of the Central and Southern Region, the Acupuncture Training Class of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Acupuncture Training Class of Xikang Province, have treated a total of more than 8,000 patients with acupuncture therapy over the past few years. There were 213 types of diseases, and acupuncture was effective for 199 types of diseases. The following diseases had the best results: neurasthenia, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, functional headache, facial nerve palsy, sciatica, chronic muscular rheumatism, chronic gastritis, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and frequent and infrequent menstruation. The effective rate (including recovery, significant progress, and progress) for each of the above diseases was above 90%. In addition, although acupuncture therapy is very effective for some diseases, it is not possible to draw preliminary conclusions because the number of treated cases is small or the observation time is short.

Among the more than 8,000 patients treated with acupuncture by these acupuncture medical institutions, most of them were accurately diagnosed using modern scientific testing methods before being treated with acupuncture. During the acupuncture treatment, no other methods were used at the same time. After the end of the treatment, the efficacy was observed for a certain period of time through communication with patients before preliminary conclusions were drawn.

The Ministry of Health Acupuncture Therapy Research Institute will conduct further research on the definitive conclusions regarding the indications for acupuncture therapy.

    卫生部针灸疗法实验所
    总结六个针灸医疗机构的临床经验
    中华人民共和国卫生部针灸疗法实验所在今年十月份总结了六个针灸医疗机构的临床经验，对针灸疗法的适应症有了初步认识。卫生部针灸疗法实验所、北京市人民政府公共卫生局针灸门诊所、中国人民解放军卫生干部学校针灸训练班、中南区针灸师资训练班、内蒙古自治区针灸训练班、西康省针灸训练班等六个机构，几年来用针灸疗法治疗的病人共有八千多名，疾病种类有二百十三种，针灸有效的疾病有一百九十九种，其中效果最好的是下列几种疾病：神经衰弱、慢性风湿性关节炎、官能性头痛、颜面神经麻痹、坐骨神经痛、慢性肌肉风湿症、慢性胃炎、慢性支气管炎、高血压、支气管喘息和频发月经和稀发月经等。上述每种疾病治疗的有效率（包括痊愈、显著进步和进步）都在百分之九十以上。此外虽然有些疾病使用针灸疗法效果很好，但因治疗的病例较少或因观察时间尚短，现在还不能作出初步结论。
    这些针灸医疗机构用针灸治疗的八千多个病人中，大部分病人都用现代科学检验等方法作出确切的诊断，然后用针灸治疗；在针灸治疗的过程中，不同时用其他方法治疗；在结束治疗以后，并通过和病人通讯联络等方法，对疗效进行一定时期的观察，然后才作出初步结论。
    卫生部针灸疗法实验所对针灸疗法适应症的肯定的结论，将作进一步的研究。
