The letter begins: "Based on the requests of visitors to the Chinese Art Exhibition, I am sending this short message in the hope that it can be published in your newspaper." The following is the text of the letter:

Recently, as the people of China and the Soviet Union celebrated this great festival—the 5th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Ulyanovsk Regional Art Museum held the Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of China. The exhibits were selected and transported here by the Soviet Ministry of Culture from the treasures of the Moscow State Museum of Oriental Culture.

The exhibition displays more than 400 pieces of Chinese art with a long history from the 1st century to the present, as well as new Chinese art (paintings, sculptures, ink paintings, porcelain, glassware, embroidery, enamelware, ivory carvings, jade carvings, boxwood carvings, lacquer carvings, etc.).

The purpose of the exhibition is to allow the residents of Ulyanovsk and various districts of the region to appreciate the masterpieces of the talented Chinese people.

From the very first days of the exhibition, the residents of Ulyanovsk have shown great interest in the art of the Chinese people.

On the opening day alone, 1,070 people visited. On Sunday, October 3rd, there were 1,450 visitors, in addition to six children's visiting groups. In the past nine days, there have been 4,294 visitors.

Factories and schools register daily to visit.

Many visitors have written their impressions praising the outstanding creations of the Chinese people in the guestbook.

Several comrades wrote:
      “China is a country with outstanding art. After visiting
    these works, we want to say these few words: the people are
    the creators of art, they have contributed all their energy,
    so they have created these great works." Brotherly greetings to the great Chinese people!

    苏联乌里扬诺夫斯克州艺术博物馆馆长诺·列文金于十月七日给本报寄来一封信，叙述了这个馆在我国建国五周年纪念日举办的“中华人民共和国艺术展览会”的情况。信的开头说：“根据中国艺术展览会参观者的要求，现寄上这篇短讯，希望能在贵报发表”。下面就是这封信的正文：
    最近，当中苏两国人民在庆祝这个伟大的节日——中华人民共和国建国五周年之际，乌里扬诺夫斯克州艺术博物馆举办了中华人民共和国艺术展览会。展览品是由苏联文化部从莫斯科国立东方文化博物馆的珍藏作品之中选出运到此地的。
    展览会上陈列了从一世纪到现代的有悠久历史的中国艺术作品，此外还有新中国的艺术作品，（绘画、雕刻、水墨画、磁器、玻璃器皿、刺绣、珐琅制品、牙雕、玉石雕、黄杨木雕、雕漆等等）共四百余件。
    展览会的目的，是使乌里扬诺夫斯克和本州各区的居民欣赏富有天才的中国人民的杰作。
    从展览会开幕的最初几天起，乌里扬诺夫斯克的居民便对中国人民的艺术作品发生了极大的兴趣。
    开幕当天就有一千零七十人参观。十月三日是星期日，参观者达一千四百五十名，此外还有六个儿童参观团。九天以来已有四千二百九十四名参观者。
    每天都有工厂、学校登记要来参观。
    许多参观者在留言簿上写下了赞扬中国人民杰出创作的感想。
    有几位同志写道：
      “中国是具有优秀艺术的国家。我们参观
    了这些作品以后，想说这样几句话：人民是
    艺术的创造者，他们贡献了自己的全部精
    力，所以才创造出这些伟大的作品。”向伟大的中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼！
