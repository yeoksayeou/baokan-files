Editorial: The Benefits of Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain for Farmers

This year, when unified purchase of grain was implemented in various regions, measures were taken to help farmers summarize the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain, using their personal experiences and visible facts to conduct vivid, specific, and intimate and practical education, further enhancing their socialist awareness, and making them consciously and voluntarily sell surplus grain to the state. Of course, because China is vast and populous, and the conditions in various regions are not entirely the same, farmers have different feelings, and the content and methods of propaganda should be diverse. But the following points are visible to farmers across the country.

A year ago, we said that the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain could guarantee grain supply, stabilize the grain market, and support national industrialization. Facts have proved that this is completely correct.

Our country entered a period of planned economic construction last year. Many new factories have started construction, and many old factories have expanded production. In order to adapt to the needs of industry, the planting area of cash crops has also been expanded accordingly. The increasing industrial population and farmers in cash crop areas all need the state's grain supply. This year, our country suffered a rare flood in a century, and the disaster-stricken people also need the state to provide relief with grain. These three items of increased expenditure will use tens of billions of catties of grain more than in previous years. If unified purchase and sale of grain had not been implemented last year, where would this grain have come from? The market across the country continued to be stable this year, the grain supply in cities and industrial and mining areas was not lacking, and there was no starvation in the disaster areas. Isn't all this due to the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain?

For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have suffered from natural disasters. Once there was a natural disaster, bureaucrats, landlords, and unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the situation and intensified their attacks on farmers, causing them to lose their family property. An elderly farmer, Liu Ditang, in Hanshou County, Hunan, said it well: "During the flood in 1931, the price of rice rose three times a day. At that time, my family had no money to buy rice, and six people went out to flee the famine, resulting in the death of three people. This year, after the embankment collapsed, the government sent rice to our door in large boats. My family of ten bought four months' worth of food at once." It is easy to understand that unscrupulous merchants caused trouble in 1931. But even after liberation, unscrupulous merchants still took advantage of the situation and attacked farmers. Last spring, wheat in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi, suffered from frost damage, and unscrupulous merchants immediately raised the price of wheat by nearly double, causing great difficulties for many farmers. This year, wheat in Yuncheng Prefecture suffered from frost damage again, but the price of wheat did not rise at all. The reason is very simple, because the unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented. This kind of thing exists in every county, every township, and every village. We should help farmers summarize them. This is the most vivid and specific self-education.

A year ago, we said that the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain could promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and weaken the connection between farmers and capitalism. Facts have also proved that this is correct.

When summarizing the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain, many elderly farmers said: "Those who did not engage in proper business in the past have now engaged in proper business." That's right. Let's think about what the situation was like in rural areas before the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain? How many farmers hired long-term laborers, lent money, bought land, mortgaged crops, hoarded grain, and engaged in speculative business? Some people even abandoned their land and sold their land to engage in speculative business. As a result, a few people made money, more people went bankrupt, and many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups disintegrated and broke up. This is what many elderly farmers call "not engaging in proper business." What about this year? Farmers have accepted the propaganda of the state's general task during the transition period, understood the principle that they should not take the capitalist road but should take the socialist road, no longer engage in activities that harm others and benefit themselves, and organize mutual aid and cooperation on a huge scale and at a high speed to develop agricultural production. In the one year up to August this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives across the country increased from more than 10,000 to 100,000, and the number of mutual aid groups increased by hundreds of thousands. The output of the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups exceeded that of individual farmers, some exceeding 30%, 50%, or even 100%. This year, natural disasters across the country were greater than last year, but grain output was higher than last year. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is a very important reason.

The state's implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain not only prevents farmers from using grain to do "improper business," but also effectively protects the interests of farmers. Farmers in the Twelfth District of Yiyang, Hunan, calculated an account: last year, farmers in the entire district sold 4.3 million catties of grain to the state, and each catty was 200 yuan higher than the purchase price of private merchants when new grain was launched in previous years, totaling 860 million yuan more. In the past year, farmers in the entire district purchased 2,088,500 catties of grain from the state, and the price per catty was 400 yuan lower than the selling price of private merchants in 1952, totaling more than 835 million yuan less. The facts of this year have given farmers another profound education and made them more aware of the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain.

A year ago, we said that unified purchase and sale of grain would promote the development of agricultural production. This year, our country's natural disasters were greater than last year, but the total grain output increased compared to last year. This fact fully proves that our statement is correct.

Of course, there are many reasons for promoting the rapid development of agricultural production. One very important reason is that farmers must have funds and a "bottom line" in order to expand reproduction. The state's unified purchase of grain has precisely increased farmers' funds and enriched their "bottom line." First of all, the price set by the state for the unified purchase of grain from farmers is very reasonable. The base price of grain purchased in 1953 was about 8% higher than in 1952, and the farmers across the country therefore received benefits of about 3 trillion yuan. This money can buy more than 2 million waterwheels, or more than 2 million head of livestock. Secondly, although our country's industry is not yet developed and cannot fully supply all the means of production needed by farmers, the state tries its best to supply farmers with more materials within the possible scope. For example, the means of production supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives across the country during the unified purchase of grain from November last year to February this year exceeded more than three times that of the same period last year; this year, it is planned to supply 258,000 new-style farm implements, an increase of 25% compared to last year; and more than 120 million old-style farm implements, an increase of 70% compared to last year. Thirdly, the state's unified purchase and sale of grain has completely changed the old market laws. In the past, farmers with surplus grain sold their surplus grain one after another, and often consumed the grain money in a piecemeal fashion; now, they concentrate on selling grain to the state and buying back a large amount of means of production at one time. According to statistics, the means of production purchased by farmers in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi, in the first half of this year increased by 133% compared to the same period last year. This is a significant example. In the past, grain-deficient farmers often worried about not being able to buy affordable food during the transition period; now, these farmers say: "With the implementation of planned grain supply, we are not afraid of not being able to buy grain, we are not afraid of rising grain prices, and we are not afraid of grain merchants adding fake ingredients and cheating people." They no longer worry about market changes like they used to, and they have the conditions to concentrate on production.

Some people (including some cadres) say: Unified purchase and sale of grain is necessary, but now we buy too much and sell too much. Isn't it a bit wasteful to buy and sell? They advocate implementing unified purchase and sale, but they want to buy less and sell less. This opinion is of course wrong. Our country's grain policy is to buy as much surplus grain as possible and guarantee reasonable supply. This is to buy as much surplus grain from farmers as possible in order to supply the needs of all parties. With the development of the country's industrialization, the population of cities, industrial and mining areas, and cash crop areas will inevitably increase year by year, and the demand for grain will also increase year by year. For a considerable period of time, we still cannot completely avoid the attacks of natural disasters, and the state must always have a batch of grain for disaster relief. Grain-deficient households in rural areas cannot be completely eliminated before the thorough realization of agricultural cooperation, and the state must also guarantee that they have grain to eat. These aspects of expenditure cannot be reduced, therefore, in the next few years, grain must not be sold less, but only reasonably supplied. Since we want to supply reasonably, of course we must try our best to keep the surplus grain in the hands of the state in order to facilitate regulation and supply.

About 200 million people now buy grain from the state, half of whom are urban residents and half of whom are farmers. The government must be responsible to the people of the whole country, and it cannot and should not only care about urban residents and not care about grain-deficient farmers. Moreover, our domestic market is unified. If the cities are managed by the state, and the rural market is allowed to be flooded by capitalism, it will inevitably completely destroy the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, causing chaos in the national market and hindering the promotion of the country's socialist industrialization.

Some farmers say: Unified purchase and sale is really good, but it is too restrictive and inconvenient for us. They want to "sell less and keep more" and "be generous in estimation and economical in use." This kind of statement and practice is obviously also wrong. What is the purpose of "selling less and keeping more" after all? Is it to hoard grain for speculative business and usury? That is going down the capitalist road, which is not only shameful, but also illegal. As for "being generous in estimation and economical in use," it is also an erroneous attitude that does not conform to the country's planned economy. It is true that selling all the surplus grain to the state is somewhat inconvenient for oneself, which means that there is less room for oneself to use it flexibly. However, the state buys surplus grain, and farmers have already retained grain, feed, seeds, and a certain amount of flexible grain in accordance with the state's policy; in this case, even if there are still some temporary difficulties, they are easy to overcome. It must be recognized that our country's industry is still too backward, and actively selling surplus grain to promote the early realization of national industrialization is the fundamental way to overcome this temporary difficulty. If we are intimidated by this difficulty and do not actively sell surplus grain, which reduces the speed of national industrialization, it will inevitably prolong the existing difficulties, or even cause greater difficulties.

When helping farmers summarize the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain and criticizing some erroneous views on unified purchase and sale, we must also distinguish between the correct policy of unified purchase and sale and some shortcomings and errors in last year's work of unified purchase and sale. In last year's work of unified purchase and sale, there were some shortcomings and errors. For example, the amount of unified purchase was too high or too low for some farmers, which was wrong. As for some areas only paying attention to unified purchase and not paying attention to unified sale, and the quantity and variety of grain distributed for unified sale were not completely appropriate, causing dissatisfaction among some farmers, this must be improved and can be improved. It should be recognized that the purpose of unified purchase is for unified sale, to ensure that everyone can eat appropriate grain; as long as the grain in the hands of the state is abundant, it will gradually meet everyone's requirements in terms of the variety and quantity of grain. Some places have also made mistakes of coercion and commandism in the work of unified purchase and sale, which cannot be tolerated. This year, we must strive to overcome and avoid repeating them. The vast number of farmers should actively cooperate with cadres and supervise them so that they do not make such mistakes again.

In this year's grain purchase work, the enthusiasm shown by the vast number of farmers is very high. This is a good phenomenon. But no one should be satisfied with this enthusiasm, and no one should therefore generate any complacency, careless and blindly optimistic emotions. We must, like last year, conduct in-depth ideological education for farmers, starting with summarizing the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain, and further enhance farmers' socialist awareness, so that not only can the state's grain purchase and sale plan be completed, but also lay a solid ideological and material foundation for the upcoming large-scale mutual aid and cooperation movement and next year's agricultural production movement.

    粮食统购统销对农民的好处
    今年各地在统购粮食的时候，都采取帮助农民总结粮食统购统销的好处的办法，用农民的切身经验和看得见的事实，对他们进行生动、具体而又亲切、实际的教育，进一步提高他们的社会主义觉悟，使他们自觉自愿地把余粮卖给国家。当然，由于我国地大人多，各地情况不尽相同，农民的感受也有所不同，宣传的内容和方式应该多种多样。但下面说到的这几点，却是全国农民都看得到的。
    一年以前，我们说，实行粮食的统购统销，可以保证粮食供应，稳定粮食市场，支持国家工业化。事实证明这话是完全对的。
    我们的国家从去年开始进入有计划的经济建设时期。许多新的工厂开工兴建了，许多旧的工厂扩大生产了，为了适应工业的需要，也相应地扩大了经济作物的种植面积。日益增加的工业人口和经济作物地区的农民，都需要国家的粮食供应。今年我国遭受了百年来少有的水灾，受灾人民也需要国家用粮食加以救济。这三项比往年增加的开支，要多用几十亿斤粮食。去年如果不实行统购统销，这笔粮食从那里来？今年全国市场继续平稳，城市和工矿区粮食供应不缺，灾区没有发生饿死人的现象，还不都是粮食统购统销的好处？
    几千年来，我国农民吃尽天灾的苦头。一有天灾，官僚、地主、奸商就乘人之危，加紧向农民进攻，弄得农民倾家荡产。湖南汉寿县老年农民刘棣堂说的好：“一九三一年闹水灾时，米价一天涨三次，那时我家没钱买米，六口人出外逃荒，结果死了三口。今年垸子溃了以后，政府用大船送米上门，我家十口人一次就买到了四个月的口粮。”一九三一年奸商捣乱作怪，那是容易理解的。但就在解放以后，奸商还是乘人之危，向农民进攻。去年春天，山西运城专区小麦遭了冻灾，奸商立时把麦价抬高将近一倍，使许多农民遭到很大困难。今年运城专区小麦又受了冻灾，麦价却一点没涨。原因很简单，就是因为实行了粮食的统购统销。这种事情，每县、每乡、每村都是有的，我们应该帮助农民总结起来，这就是最生动、最具体的自我教育。
    一年以前，我们说，实行粮食统购统销，可以促进互助合作运动的发展，削弱农民和资本主义的联系。事实也证明了这话是对的。
    在总结粮食统购统销的好处的时候，许多老年农民说：“那些过去不务正的人，这一年都务正了。”一点不错。我们想想，在实行粮食统购统销以前，农村中是一种什么情形呢？多少农民雇长工、放债、买土地、典青苗、囤粮食、做投机生意，有的人甚至荒了土地，卖掉土地，去做投机生意。结果，个别的人赚了钱，较多的人破了产，不少农业生产合作社和互助组却涣散了、散伙了。这就是许多老年农民所说的“不务正”。今年呢？农民们接受国家过渡时期总任务的宣传，懂得了不应走资本主义道路，而应走社会主义道路的道理，再不作那损人利己的事情，而以巨大的规模和速度，组织互助合作，发展农业生产。到今年八月的一年时间里，全国的农业生产合作社由一万多个发展到十万个，互助组更增加了几十万个。绝大部分农业生产合作社和互助组的产量都超过单干农民，有的超过百分之三十、五十，甚至百分之百。今年全国自然灾害比去年大，而粮食产量比去年高，互助合作运动的发展，是一个十分重要的原因。
    国家实行粮食统购统销，不仅阻止农民用粮食去作“不务正”的事情，而且有效地保护了农民的利益。湖南益阳十二区农民算了一笔账：去年全区农民卖给国家粮食四百三十万斤，每斤比往年新谷登场时私商的收购价格高二百元，共计多得八亿六千万元。一年来全区农民向国家购买粮食二百零八万八千五百斤，每斤价格比一九五二年私商的出卖价格低四百元，共计少出八亿三千五百多万元。这一年来的事实使农民又受了一次深刻的教育，更加认清粮食统购统销的好处。
    一年以前，我们说，粮食统购统销会促进农业生产的发展。今年我国的自然灾害大过去年，但粮食总产量却比去年增加了。这个事实，完全证明我们的说法是正确的。
    当然，促进农业生产迅速发展的原因是很多的。其中一个很重要的原因，就是农民要有资金，有“底垫”，以便扩大再生产。国家统购粮食，恰恰使农民增加了资金，充实了“底垫”。首先，国家向农民统购粮食，规定的价格是很合理的。一九五三年粮食统购的基价比一九五二年大约提高了百分之八，全国农民因此得到的利益，约有三万亿元左右。用这笔钱买水车，能买二百多万辆；买牲口，能买两百多万头。其次，虽然我们国家的工业还不发达，还不能充分供应农民所需要的一切生产资料，但在可能的范围以内，国家尽量给农民供应更多的物资。例如，全国供销合作社在去年十一月到今年二月统购粮食期间供应的生产资料，超过前年同期的三倍以上；今年计划供应的新式农具有二十五万八千部，比去年增加百分之二十五；旧式农具一亿两千多万件，比去年增加百分之七十。第三，国家统购统销粮食，完全改变了旧的市场规律。在过去，有余粮的农民陆续出售余粮，常常就把粮款零星消耗掉了；现在集中把粮食卖给国家，一次购回大宗的生产资料。据统计，山西运城专区农民今年上半年购买的生产资料，比去年同期增加百分之一百三十三。这就是一个显著的例子。过去，缺粮农民在青黄不接时候，经常发愁买不到价格适当的口粮；现在，这些农民说：“实行粮食计划供应，一不怕买不到粮食，二不怕粮价上涨，三不怕粮商搀假坑人。”他们再不像过去那样耽心市场的变化，他们有条件安心生产了。
    有些人（包括某些干部）说：粮食统购统销是必要的，但现在购得太多，销得又多，一进一出，未免有些浪费。他们主张实行统购统销，但是要少购少销。这个意见当然是错误的。我们国家的粮食政策是尽量多购余粮、保证合理供应的政策。这就是尽可能地把农民的余粮买过来，以便供应各方面的需要。随着国家工业化事业的发展，城市、工矿区、经济作物区的人口势必逐年增加，需要的粮食也要逐年增加。在相当长的时间以内，我们还不能完全避免灾荒的袭击，国家必须随时掌握一批救灾的粮食。农村的缺粮户在农业合作化彻底实现以前，是不可能完全消灭的，国家也要保证他们有粮食吃。这几方面的开支都不能少，因此，在今后若干年内，粮食绝不能少销，而只能合理供应。既然要合理供应，当然要尽量把余粮掌握在国家手里，才能便于调剂供应。
    现在向国家买粮食的约有两亿人口，一半是城市居民，一半是农民。政府要对全国人民负责，不可能也不应该只管城市居民，不管缺粮的农民。而且，我们国内的市场是统一的，如果城市由国家管理，而农村市场任凭资本主义泛滥，势必完全破坏粮食统购统销政策，造成全国市场的混乱，使国家的社会主义工业化事业的推行受到阻力。
    有些农民说：统购统销确实好，只是对我们太拘束，不方便。他们想要“少卖多留”、“宽打窄用”。这种说法和作法，显然也是错误的。“少卖多留”究竟是为什么呢？把粮食囤积起来，做投机生意、放高利贷么？那是走到资本主义路上去了，不仅是可耻的，而且是违法的。至于“宽打窄用”，也是不合乎国家计划经济的错误态度。的确，把余粮都卖给国家，对自己是有一些不方便，这就是少了自己机动使用的余地。但是国家买的是余粮，农民已经按照国家的政策，保留了口粮、饲料、种籽和一定数量的机动粮；在这种情况下，即使还有某些暂时的困难，也是容易克服的了。必须认识：我们国家的工业还太落后，踊跃出售余粮，促使国家工业化早日实现，正是克服这种暂时困难的根本办法。如果被这种困难所吓倒，不积极出售余粮，以致减低国家工业化的速度，就必然使现有的困难拖长，甚至引起更大的困难。
    在帮助农民总结粮食统购统销的好处，批判某些对统购统销的错误看法的时候，还必须把正确的统购统销政策和去年统购统销工作中的某些缺点、错误区别开来。在去年的统购统销工作中，是有某些缺点和错误的。例如：统购数量对某些农户有偏高偏低现象，这是不对的。至于某些地区只注意统购，不注意统销，统销粮食的数量、品种分配不完全恰当，引起某些农民的不满，这是必须改进和可以改进的。应该认识，统购的目的是为了统销，保证大家都能吃到适当的粮食；只要国家掌握的粮食充裕了，是会在粮食的品种、数量方面逐渐满足大家的要求的。某些地方在统购统销工作中也曾发生过强迫命令的错误，这是不能容许的。今年必须力求克服，避免重复发生。广大农民应该积极和干部合作，监督他们不再发生这种错误。
    在今年的粮食统购工作中，广大农民表现的热情是很高的。这是一种好现象。但任何人不应该满足于这种热情，不应该因此产生任何麻痹大意、盲目乐观的情绪。我们必须像去年一样，对农民进行深入的思想教育，从总结粮食统购统销的好处入手，进一步提高农民的社会主义觉悟，不仅使国家的粮食统购统销计划能够完成，而且给即将到来的大规模互助合作运动和明年的农业生产运动，奠定坚实的思想基础和物质基础。
