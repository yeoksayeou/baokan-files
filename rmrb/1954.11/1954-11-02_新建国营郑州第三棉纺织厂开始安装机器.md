    The newly established state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory has begun installing machinery. This textile factory has 100,000 spindles and more than 2,000 looms. Construction began on April 16th of this year, and now the factory buildings and rows of staff dormitories equipped with heating have been completed one after another.
    The machinery installed in the factory is all manufactured in our own country. Some of the machines were successfully trial-produced by the staff of our country's textile industry sector not long ago. These new machines have been greatly improved. The new single-process cotton opener not only occupies less factory space than the old two-process cotton opener, but also requires fewer workers. The new winder has a high speed, capable of rotating 3,000 revolutions per minute; while the old one could only rotate more than 400 revolutions per minute. The new single-process three-roller roving frame is also much better than the general roving frame. Improvements to some machinery and equipment also pay close attention to the safety of workers' labor and the hygiene of the working environment. The carding machine is equipped with a device that can automatically suck out cotton fibers and debris, keeping the workshop clean. (Our newspaper's Henan reporter station)

    新建国营郑州第三棉纺织厂开始安装机器
    国营郑州第三棉纺织厂开始安装机器。这个纺织工厂有十万纱锭和两千多台织布机，在今年四月十六日动工兴建，现在厂房和一座座装有暖气设备的职工宿舍先后建成。
    该厂安装的机器，都是我国自己制造的。有些机器是我国纺织工业部门的职工们在不久以前试制成功的。这些新型机器都有了很大的改进。新型的单程清花机，不但比旧型的二道清花机少占用厂房面积，而且可以少用许多工人。新型的络筒机的速度很快，每分钟能转三千转；而旧型的每分钟只能转四百多转。新型的单程三道粗纱机也比一般粗纱机好得多。有些机器设备的改进，也非常注意工人劳动的安全和工作环境的卫生。梳棉机设有一种设备，它可以自动地把棉花毛和杂物吸出去，保持车间清洁。  （本报河南记者站）
