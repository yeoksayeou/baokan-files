To protect the health of the people in the disaster areas, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has newly made 410,000 cotton-padded clothes for the disaster victims. Cadres throughout the province and the people of Wuhan City have demonstrated a high degree of class friendship by donating over 700,000 cotton-padded clothes to the disaster victims. These cotton-padded clothes have now been distributed to the counties, and in many areas, the clothes have already been distributed to the disaster victims. The disaster victims were very grateful to receive the relief cotton-padded clothes. Disaster victims in Huangpi County said, "The government provides both relief and loans, and now has given us cotton-padded clothes for the winter. Chairman Mao's kindness is truly endless." Xu Deyi, a poor peasant in Jiulong Township, Hanyang County, received a beautiful new cotton-padded coat with a letter of sympathy in the pocket. It turned out that this cotton-padded coat was donated by Sun Changfang, a female worker in Wuhan City. He was deeply moved and said, "Workers and peasants are truly one family, they gave us their beloved cotton-padded clothes." He immediately asked someone to write a thank-you letter to Sun Changfang. Jiulong Township also wrote a letter to the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions in the name of the entire township to express their gratitude. (Report from Hubei Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    湖北省给灾区农民发放棉衣一百多万件
    湖北省人民政府为了保护灾区人民的身体健康，为灾民新做棉衣四十一万件，全省干部和武汉市人民发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，给灾民捐助棉衣七十余万件。现在这些棉衣已经发到县，不少地区已将棉衣发到灾民手里。灾民接到救济的棉衣非常感激。黄陂县灾民说：“政府又是救济，又是贷款，冬天又发了棉衣，毛主席的恩情真是说不完。”汉阳县九龙乡贫农徐德应得到一件漂亮的新棉衣，棉衣的口袋里有封慰问信。原来这件棉衣是武汉市女工孙昌芳捐助的。他深深受了感动，说：“工人和农民真是一家人，他们把心爱的棉衣给了我们。”他马上找人给孙昌芳写了封感谢信。九龙乡还以全乡名义向武汉市工会联合会写信表示感谢。 （本报湖北记者站）
