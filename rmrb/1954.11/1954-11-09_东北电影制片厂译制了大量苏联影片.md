	The Northeast Film Studio has translated ninety-six Soviet feature films and forty animated and science education films in the past five years, playing an important role in Sino-Soviet cultural exchange. The Soviet films dubbed by the Northeast Film Studio, which reflect the noble qualities of the Soviet people and the most beautiful aspects of human life, have been welcomed by the vast number of Chinese audiences after being screened in China. Among them, Soviet films such as "Private Ivan", "A Happy Life", "Lights Shine on the Highland Village", "The Oath", and "Donbas Miners" are particularly loved by the audience. People from all walks of life across the country frequently write letters to the Northeast Film Studio, expressing their excitement after watching Soviet films.
	The Soviet Union not only continuously selects a large number of excellent films for our country to dub, but also helps the development of China's film industry in various ways. As early as the Liberation War period, the Soviet Union provided great assistance to the Chinese people in restoring and establishing the Northeast Film Studio. In the past five years, the Soviet Union has successively sent Soviet film artists' delegations and film engineers to the Northeast Film Studio to systematically introduce the experience of dubbing films.
	All the film translation staff of the Northeast Film Studio believe that dubbing Soviet films is a great honor, and they work with the most enthusiastic and serious attitude. They have continuously improved the quality of dubbed films, and further demanded that the translated language be accurate, popular, and fully express the content and style of the original work.

    东北电影制片厂译制了大量苏联影片
    东北电影制片厂五年来已翻译了九十六部苏联故事影片和四十部动画片、科学教育片，对中苏文化交流起了重要的作用。东北电影制片厂译制的反映苏联人民高尚品质和人类最美好的生活的苏联影片在中国放映后，受到我国广大观众的欢迎。其中如“普通一兵”、“幸福的生活”、“光明照耀到高地村”、“宣誓”、“顿巴斯矿工”等苏联影片，特别为观众所热爱。全国各阶层人民经常给东北电影制片厂写信，表示他们看到苏联影片的兴奋心情。
    苏联不仅不断地选择大量的优秀影片供应我国译制，还从各方面帮助我国电影事业的发展。早在解放战争时期，中国人民在恢复和建立东北电影制片厂时，苏联便给了很大的帮助。五年来苏联先后派苏联电影艺术工作者代表团和电影工程师来到东北电影制片厂，系统地介绍了译制影片的经验。
    东北电影制片厂全体翻译影片工作人员都认为译制苏联影片是极大的光荣，他们以最热情严肃的心情进行工作。不断地提高了译制片的质量，并进一步要求译语准确、通俗，充分表达原作内容和风格。（新华社）
