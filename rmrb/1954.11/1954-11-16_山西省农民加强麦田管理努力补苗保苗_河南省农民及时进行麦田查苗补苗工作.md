Shanxi Farmers Strengthen Wheat Field Management to Strive to Replenish Seedlings and Protect Seedlings
Henan Farmers Timely Conduct Wheat Field Inspection and Seedling Replenishment

    Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province have begun to strengthen field management of winter wheat to protect wheat seedlings and ensure their safe overwintering. Farmers in Zhongyang, Dongyang and other villages in Wanrong County found that some areas in 300 mu of wheat fields were missing seedlings and had broken ridges. They carefully replenished the seedlings. Women and children in Li Weixi's group of the Nan'e Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangyuan County replanted 45 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings in three days. Farmers in Jieyu County cultivated soil around the roots of wheat seedlings, actively eliminated pests, enhanced the frost resistance of seedlings, and formulated wheat protection covenants to organize goose hunting teams to protect wheat seedlings.
    In mid-October, the sowing of more than 17 million mu of winter wheat in Shanxi Province ended. Due to a series of improvements in wheat field preparation and sowing technology, the wheat seedlings after breaking ground grew very strong. Jinan Prefecture, which accounts for 65 percent of the province's total wheat field area, is already a lush green. The missing seedling rate in wheat fields in this prefecture has been reduced from 20 percent last year to 5 to 10 percent this year. Recently, farmers in various places have begun to strengthen wheat field management, which is conducive to further improving the yield per unit area of ​​wheat next year.
    
    Farmers in Henan Province, after planting wheat, also timely conducted seedling inspection and replanting work to ensure full seedlings. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various places took the lead in carrying out seedling inspection and replanting work. For example, the "Mingxing" and "Jinxing" agricultural production cooperatives in Shilipu, District 1, Xinxiang County, dispatched 20 people to replant 200 mu of wheat in four days. In District 8 of Mi County, driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, a total of 686 people were dispatched to carry out replanting. The secretary of the Zhangzhuang CPC branch in District 1 of Tangyin personally led the technicians of three agricultural production cooperatives and 22 members of the seedling replanting team to replant 95 mu in one day using eight seedling replanting machines. In some places, fearing that replanting would be past the season, they carried out transplanting one after another. The transplanted wheat seedlings are as vigorous as the original seedlings. Now, the wheat seedlings throughout the province are generally growing well, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

    山西省农民加强麦田管理努力补苗保苗
    河南省农民及时进行麦田查苗补苗工作
    山西省各地农民开始加强冬小麦的田间管理，保护麦苗安全过冬。万荣县中阳、东阳等村农民发现三百亩麦田里有些地方缺苗断垅，便仔细地把苗补齐。襄垣县南娥乡农业生产合作社李维喜等小组的妇女和儿童，在三天内补种了四十五亩缺苗的麦田。解虞县农民在麦苗的根部培土，积极扑灭虫害，增强幼苗的抗冻能力，并制订护麦公约，组织打雁小组，保护麦苗。
    十月中旬，山西省一千七百多万亩冬小麦播种结束。由于麦田整理和播种技术上有一系列的改进，破土后的麦苗长得都很茁壮。占全省麦田总面积百分之六十五的晋南专区，田野里已一片葱绿。这个专区的麦田缺苗率由去年的百分之二十，减少到今年的百分之五到十。最近各地农民开始加强麦田管理，有利于明年小麦单位面积产量的进一步提高。　　　　（新华社）×××河南省农民在种完小麦后，又及时进行查苗补种工作，以确保全苗。各地农业生产合作社和互助组都带头进行查苗补种工作。如新乡县一区十里铺“明星”、“金星”等农业生产合作社，出动二十人四天补种小麦二百亩。密县八区在互助合作组织带动下，共出动六百八十六人进行补种。汤阴一区张庄中共支部书记亲自带领三个农业生产合作社的技术员、补苗组二十二人，用八部补苗器一天补种九十五亩。有的地方恐怕补种过了季节，纷纷进行移栽，移栽的麦苗与原种的苗一样旺盛。现在全省的小麦幼苗普遍生长良好，已为明年丰收奠定基础。
