    How We Organize Self-Study for Junior High School Graduates Who Failed to Enter Higher Education
    Youth League Hangzhou Municipal Committee Propaganda Department
    Most of the junior high school graduates in Hangzhou who failed to enter higher education this year and are temporarily unable to participate in production have actively and happily participated in various self-study activities, preparing to engage in labor production or continue their education when conditions permit.

    Organizing self-study for junior high school graduates who failed to enter higher education is a new task, involving a wide range of issues and complex problems. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this work. In May of this year, the Party's reporter conducted a widespread publicity campaign among the city's people. The Party Committee also convened meetings with relevant parties to make specific arrangements for this work. Our work plans were also reviewed and approved by the Party Committee.

    In order to gain the support and assistance of all sectors of society, with the approval of the Party Committee, the Hangzhou Municipal Primary and Junior High School Graduates Self-Study Guidance Committee was jointly formed by the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, and relevant mass organizations and social culture and education institutions. Practical experience has shown that this is a very good organizational form. All units attach great importance to this work and have given many guidance and assistance to junior high school graduates studying at home. For example, libraries, cultural centers, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Center have all formulated measures to facilitate the borrowing of books by junior high school graduates; they have also organized reading groups and literature lectures to guide self-study students in reading; the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Science and Technology Popularization Association have also held literature and science lectures for students. Sports fields and other venues are lent to self-study students for sports activities and sports equipment. All of these are important material conditions for organizing self-study activities.

    Our organization of self-study work is based on extensive publicity and education. During the publicity process, we found that parents and students generally lacked confidence in self-study, so we held parent meetings and conducted home visits, focusing on resolving ideological problems in this regard. We also summarized the experience of the Xu Chonghua self-study group, which achieved good results in self-study among last year's junior high school graduates, and organized them to give reports and hold seminars in various schools, providing first-hand accounts for publicity. At the same time, we also published several articles promoting self-study in newspapers. In addition, we widely introduced students to read Wu Yunduo's "Dedicate Everything to the Party" and Li Shiyuan's "I Studied on My Sickbed for Fifteen Years" (published in the Shanghai "Wenhui Daily" on September 12, 1953) and other books and articles, inspiring students to learn from their tenacious spirit of self-study and further enhancing their confidence in self-study.

    The self-study methods of junior high school graduates in Hangzhou are diverse, and the basic organizational forms are cultural tutoring schools and self-study groups. There is one youth cultural tutoring school in the city, with more than 190 junior high school graduates participating in the tutoring school; there are more than 60 self-study groups, with more than 600 junior high school graduates participating. Judging from the situation in the past period, self-study groups are a form worth promoting widely in the future. Self-study groups should generally be organized according to regions. We started by organizing them according to schools, but now we are adjusting them and gradually changing them to be organized according to regions. The learning method of self-study groups is currently mostly listening to the cultural tutoring broadcasts of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station. The work of the group in listening to the broadcast lectures is: 1. Solve the problem of venue and radio; if the group cannot solve it, mobilize social forces to help solve it; 2. Supervise students to study diligently and complete their homework on time; 3. Organize discussions on difficult problems; 4. Organize everyone to correct each other's homework. However, some self-study groups do not listen to cultural broadcast lectures. They stipulate the content of study according to their own conditions and needs, study independently at ordinary times, and gather regularly to discuss and help each other solve difficult problems in individual self-study. Difficult problems that self-study groups cannot solve are asked to teachers in nearby schools. The school is responsible for answering questions from self-study groups.

    We attach great importance to mobilizing and organizing students who are self-studying to actively participate in social work and housework. At present, most junior high school graduates participate in certain social work, mainly social cultural publicity and sanitation work. According to statistics from 54 self-study groups with more than 420 people: 83 people serve as teachers in spare-time schools, more than 180 people have participated in various exhibitions as narrators or receptionists, about 30 people serve as librarians and slide projectionists in cultural centers and Sino-Soviet Friendship Centers, and many people also serve in street work, and participation in housework is even more common. Facts have proved that organizing self-study students to participate in certain social work and housework is of great significance. On the one hand, it can cultivate their mass viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and good qualities of enthusiastically serving the masses. On the other hand, it also exercises their working ability and enriches their practical knowledge. For example, junior high school graduates who participated in the Zhejiang Provincial Technology Innovation Exhibition as narrators understood a lot of production technology knowledge; students who served as teachers in spare-time schools worked very seriously and responsibly, and were generally well received. They also consolidated and improved their knowledge in teaching; those who did residents' work learned some methods of doing mass work, greatly strengthening their mass viewpoint. However, there are also many ideological problems and specific difficulties in their work process, which requires us to pay more attention and care, and strengthen our help and education to them.

    Junior high school graduates have just left school, are not accustomed to independent activities, and will not arrange their own lives, and at the same time they love to play. According to this characteristic, in organizing their self-study, we must pay attention to guiding them to correctly arrange their personal lives and appropriately carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. If we do not care about their lives and do not appropriately meet their cultural activity requirements, they may either feel that self-study life is boring and unsustainable, or they may run around and develop many bad habits. Among the junior high school graduates who did not enter higher education in the previous year, because we did not lead them well and did not care about their lives, individual students were eroded by bourgeois ideology and engaged in degenerate behaviors such as messing around with relationships between men and women, gambling, and stealing. Accepting this lesson, we began to care about their lives this year, guiding self-study students to arrange their work, study, and life well. Our main method is to mobilize them to make plans and conduct regular inspections and supervision within the group. We also use various conditions to carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities: each school has stipulated appropriate measures to allow students from nearby self-study groups to go to the school regularly for ball games; they are also appropriately absorbed into city-wide youth activities; in addition, we also rely on their own creativity and efforts to use various social and natural conditions to carry out diverse activities. Such as organizing outings, mountain climbing, participating in youth rowing teams, visiting exhibitions and museums, watching movies, organizing parties, etc.; finally, we also pay attention to cultivating the collective spirit of unity and friendship of the self-study group, in a group everyone urges each other, encourages each other, so that everyone feels that the group is very kind and warm, and they are willing to talk to the group about any ideological distress, and no one feels lonely. Work has proved that this is also one of the conditions to ensure that the group can persist in learning and obtain good learning results.

    我们是怎样组织未能升学的初中毕业生进行自学的
    青年团杭州市委宣传部
    杭州市今年未能升学又暂时不能参加生产的初中毕业生，大部分都积极愉快地参加了各种自学活动，准备在条件许可时从事劳动生产或继续升学。
    组织未能升学的初中毕业生进行自学是一项新的工作，它牵涉的面很广，问题很复杂。中共杭州市委是十分重视这一工作的。今年五月党的报告员曾向全市人民普遍地进行了一次宣传。党委并曾召集各有关方面举行会议，具体布置了这一工作。我们的工作计划也都是经过党委审查批准的。
    为了争取社会各方面的支持和帮助，经党委批准，由市文教局、团市委、民主青年联合会及各有关群众团体和社会文化宣传教育机构共同组成了杭州市高小、初中毕业生自学指导委员会。实际工作证明这是一种很好的组织形式。各单位都很重视这一工作，给了在家自学的初中毕业生许多指导和帮助。如图书馆、文化馆和中苏友谊馆等都制定了办法，便利初中毕业生借书；它们并组织了读书小组，文学讲座等，指导自学学生阅读；文联、科学技术普及协会等也为同学们举办了文学、科学讲座。体育场等借给自学学生以运动场地和运动器具。所有这些，都是组织自学活动的重要的物质条件。
    我们的组织自学工作是建立在广泛的宣传教育的基础之上的。在宣传过程中，我们发现家长和学生对于自学普遍缺乏信心，于是又召开家长会议，进行家庭访问，着重解决这方面的思想问题。我们也总结了去年初中毕业生当中自学有成绩的徐重华自学小组的经验，并组织他们到各校去做报告、开座谈会，现身说法地进行了宣传，同时在报纸上也发表了几篇宣传自学的文章。另外，我们还普遍地介绍同学们阅读吴运铎的“把一切献给党”和李士媛的“我在病床上自学了十五年”（发表于一九五三年九月十二日上海“文汇报”）等书籍、文章，启发同学们学习他们顽强的自学精神，进一步增强了自学信心。
    杭州市初中毕业生的自学方式是多种多样的，而基本的组织形式是文化补习学校和自学小组。全市有青年文化补习学校一所，参加补习学校学习的初中毕业生有一百九十多人；自学小组六十多个，参加学习的初中毕业生有六百多人。从过去一段时间的情况看来，自学小组是今后值得广泛推广的一种形式。自学小组一般应按照地区组织。我们开始时是按学校组织的，现在正在调整，逐步改为按地区组织。自学小组的学习方式，目前大部分是收听上海人民广播电台的文化补习广播讲座。小组在收听广播讲座中的工作是：一、解决场地和收音机的问题，如小组无法解决，便动员社会力量来帮助解决；二、督促同学认真学习、按时完成作业；三、有疑难问题，组织讨论；四、组织大家互相批改作业。但也有一部分自学小组不是收听文化广播讲座的，他们根据自己的条件和需要规定学习内容，平时分散自学，定期集中讨论，互相帮助解决个人自学中的疑难问题。自学小组不能解决的疑难问题，便问附近学校里的教师。学校负责解答自学小组的问题。
    我们十分重视动员和组织自学的同学积极参加社会工作和家务劳动。目前大部分初中毕业生都参加了一定的社会工作，主要是社会文化宣传和卫生工作。据五十四个自学小组四百二十多人的统计：担任业余学校教师的有八十三人，先后参加各种展览会做讲解或招待工作的有一百八十多人，担任文化馆、中苏友谊馆图书管理员、幻灯放映员的约三十多人，此外许多人还担任了街道工作，参加家务劳动的更普遍了。事实证明，组织自学的学生参加一定的社会工作和家务劳动是有很大意义的，它一方面可以培养他们的群众观点、劳动观点和热心为群众服务的优良品质，另一方面也锻炼了他们的工作能力，丰富了他们的实际知识。比如参加浙江省技术革新展览会做讲解员工作的初中毕业生，懂得了许多生产技术知识；担任业余学校教师的学生，工作都很认真负责，普遍得到好评，他们在教学中也巩固和提高了自己的知识；做居民工作的，学会了一些做群众工作的方法，大大加强了自己的群众观点。但他们在工作过程中的思想问题和具体困难也是很多的，这需要我们多加关心和照顾，加强对他们的帮助和教育。
    初中毕业生刚离开学校，不习惯独立活动，不会安排自己的生活，同时他们又爱玩好动。根据这个特点，在组织他们自学中必须注意指导他们正确地安排个人生活，适当地开展文化娱乐和体育活动。如果不关心他们的生活，不适当满足他们文化活动的要求，他们或者会感到自学生活枯燥乏味，坚持不下去；或者会到处乱跑，染上许多不良的习惯。上届没有升学的初中毕业生中，由于我们没有很好地加以领导，不关心他们的生活，有个别的学生，受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，发生了乱搞男女关系、赌博、偷窃等等堕落行为。接受这个教训，我们今年开始关心他们的生活，指导自学的学生很好地安排工作、学习和生活。我们采用的主要方法是发动他们订立计划和在小组内经常进行检查督促。我们还利用各种条件，开展文化娱乐和体育活动：各校规定了适当的办法，让附近的自学小组的学生定期到校里去进行球类活动；有全市性的青年活动，也适当地吸收他们参加；此外，还依靠他们自己的创造和努力，利用各种社会条件和自然条件，开展多样性的活动。如组织郊游、爬山，参加青年划船队，参观展览会、博物馆，看电影，组织联欢等；最后，我们还注意努力培养自学小组的团结友爱的集体主义精神，在一个小组之内大家互相督促，互相鼓励，使每一个人都感到小组很亲切温暖，自己有什么思想苦闷都愿意和小组谈，没有一个人感到孤单寂寞。工作证明，这也是保证小组能够坚持学习并且获得良好学习效果的条件之一。
