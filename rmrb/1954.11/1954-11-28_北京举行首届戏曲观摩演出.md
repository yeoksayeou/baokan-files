    Beijing Holds First Opera Performance Festival
    The opening ceremony of the First Beijing Opera Performance Festival was held on the 25th. More than 20 professional opera troupes and students from the Beijing Opera School are participating in this performance festival. During the 20-day period, they will perform more than 40 programs of four opera genres: Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Qin Opera, and Quyi Opera. These programs are generally created, adapted, and reorganized by the Beijing opera community in recent years.
    This performance festival has been in preparation for more than half a year. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and the Chinese Academy of Opera have all sent opera staff to help professional opera troupes adapt and reorganize programs, improve performing arts, and stage design. Actors from many opera troupes enthusiastically rehearsed new plays during their rest time after performances. Some small private professional opera troupes also rehearsed new plays reflecting real life to participate in the performance festival. The Performance Festival Committee also established an award committee to conduct evaluations to reward outstanding programs and performers in this performance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京举行首届戏曲观摩演出
    北京市第一届戏曲观摩演出二十五日举行开幕式。参加这次观摩演出的有二十多个职业剧团和北京市戏曲学校的学生，他们将在为时二十天的期间内，演出京剧、评剧、秦腔、曲艺剧四个剧种的四十多个剧目。这些剧目一般都是北京市戏曲界几年来所创作、改编和整理的。
    这次观摩演出经过半年多的筹备，北京市人民政府文化事业管理处、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会和中国戏曲研究院都曾派出戏曲工作人员，帮助职业剧团改编整理剧目、改进表演艺术和舞台设计。许多剧团的演员们利用演剧后休息时间热情地排练新剧。有些小型的民营职业剧团这次也排演了反映现实生活的新剧参加观摩演出。观摩演出委员会并成立了评奖委员会进行评选，以奖励这次演出中的优秀剧目和表演者。　（新华社）
