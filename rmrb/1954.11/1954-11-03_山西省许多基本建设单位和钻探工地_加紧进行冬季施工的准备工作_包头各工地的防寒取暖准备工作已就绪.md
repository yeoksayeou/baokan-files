Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Basic construction units and drilling sites in Shanxi Province that are about to undertake winter construction are stepping up preparations. In the Datong mining area, where the minimum temperature has dropped below zero degrees, the heating pipes have already been installed at the wellhead construction site of No. 3 well in the first mine. Heating boilers, mats, and leather clothes for workers for cold protection at the various drilling sites in the Datong mining area have been fully prepared. Roads have been opened in advance at the sites where drilling rigs are to be installed, and electric pole pits have been dug and the foundations leveled. In the Taiyuan area, which is still a month away from freezing, most of the insulation steam pipes required for the winter installation project of the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant have been installed; Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is compiling a winter construction plan; and the No. 5 Engineering Company directly under North China has established a winter construction preparation committee and has been conducting winter construction training among employees since October 20.
    Shanxi Province's basic construction projects have a larger winter construction task this year than in any previous year. In the Taiyuan area, only the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant implemented winter construction last year. This year, in addition to this plant, there are four important engineering units, including Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. The implementation of winter construction in these projects is an important measure to accelerate progress. After the No. 3 well project of the No. 1 Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau and the restoration project of the Baidong Coal Mine are implemented in winter, they can be put into production in time next year; the riveting and welding workshop and forging workshop of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant can also be put into production next year after winter construction. After these units complete the construction of auxiliary projects this winter, they can concentrate their efforts on the construction of major projects next year.
    In order to overcome the technical and equipment difficulties in winter construction, ensure project quality and prevent waste, the Basic Construction Department of the CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee convened a meeting of responsible party cadres of winter construction units on October 19. The meeting introduced the experiences and lessons of winter construction at the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant and discussed the methods of compiling winter construction budgets and mutual cooperation.
    [Report from this newspaper] Various construction sites in Baotou City have made preparations for winter construction.
    This year, the amount of basic construction projects in Baotou City has increased five times compared to last year, and more than 80% has been completed by the end of October. The entire civil engineering construction of the large-scale state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory (formerly North China Sugar Factory) was completed in mid-October, and machine installation has now begun. Other units that started construction earlier have also completed external projects, and internal painting and electrical installation projects are about to begin. Some dedicated railway and housing construction for factories have already started in October, and some are still preparing to start.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of winter construction, the CPC Baotou Municipal Committee inspected the preparation of various winter construction units in late October, and printed and distributed experience summary materials related to winter construction to organize employees of various units to study. At present, sugar factories, power plants, and some other newly built local state-owned factories that plan to carry out installation projects in winter have compiled the general progress plan and construction organization design draft for winter construction. Foundation projects and open-air installation projects that must be completed before freezing are being concentrated on and intensified. Railways and construction sites that will be constructed in winter have mostly formulated technical measures plans for construction and have made preparations for cold protection, heating, water and electricity supply, and machine protection. Straw bags, mats, etc. are being continuously transported to the site.
    Workers from Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places who came to Baotou this year to participate in construction do not have experience in spending the winter in Inner Mongolia, but after mobilization and cold protection education, and after solving the necessary winter supplies, everyone's work enthusiasm is very high, guaranteeing to complete the winter construction tasks on time.

    山西省许多基本建设单位和钻探工地
    加紧进行冬季施工的准备工作
    包头各工地的防寒取暖准备工作已就绪
    据新华社讯：将要实行冬季施工的山西省基本建设单位和钻探工地，加紧进行冬季施工的准备工作。在最低温度已降到零度以下的大同矿区，一矿三号井井口工地已经安好暖气管。大同矿区各钻探工地防寒用的暖气锅炉、席子和工人穿的皮衣都已准备齐全，将要安装钻机的地方也预先开好了道路，挖好了电杆坑，平好了地基。距结冻还有一个月的太原地区，新建太原第一发电厂冬季安装工程需要的保暖汽管大部分已经安好；太原重型机器厂正在编制冬季施工计划；华北直属第五工程公司已成立起冬季施工准备委员会，并从十月二十日开始在职工中进行冬季施工训练。
    山西省基本建设工程今年冬季施工的任务超过以往任何一年。太原地区去年实行冬季施工的只有新建太原第一发电厂，今年除了这个厂以外，还有太原重型机器厂等四个重要工程单位。这些工程实行冬季施工，是加速进度的重要措施。大同矿务局一矿三号井工程和白洞煤矿的恢复工程实行冬季施工后，就可以在明年及时投入生产；太原重型机器厂铆焊车间、锻压车间经过冬季施工后，也可以在明年投入生产。这些单位在今年冬季完成附属工程的建设以后，明年就可集中力量建设主要工程。
  为了克服冬季施工中的技术、设备等困难，保证工程质量并防止浪费，中共太原市委员会基本建设部在十月十九日召集冬季施工单位党的负责干部开会。会上介绍了新建太原第一发电厂冬季施工的经验教训，并讨论了编制冬季施工预算和互相协作的办法。
    【本报讯】包头市各建设工地已做好冬季施工的准备工作。
    今年包头市基本建设工程量比去年增加五倍，到十月底已完成百分之八十以上。规模巨大的国营包头糖厂（原华北糖厂）全部土木建筑工程已在十月中旬完成，现已开始安装机器。其他开工较早的单位，也都已完成了外部工程，内部粉刷和电气安装工程即将开始。还有一些工厂专用铁路和房屋建筑已在十月份开工，有的还在准备开工。
    为了保证冬季施工的顺利进行，中共包头市委员会在十月下旬检查了各冬季施工单位的准备情况，并印发了有关冬季施工的经验总结材料，组织各单位职工学习。目前，计划在冬季进行安装工程的糖厂、发电厂和其他一些新建地方国营工厂，已把冬季施工的总进度计划和施工组织设计草案编好，必须在结冻前完成的基础工程和露天安装工程，正在集中力量加紧进行。要在冬季施工的铁路和各建设工地，大都制订了施工技术措施计划，并做好了防寒、取暖、水电供应、机器保护等准备工作，草袋、席子等正陆续运入现场。
    今年从上海、广东等地到包头参加建设的工人，没有在内蒙古过冬的经验，但经过动员和防寒教育，并解决冬季必需品后，大家的工作情绪都很高，保证要按时完成冬季施工任务。
