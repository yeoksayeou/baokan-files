    People are Transforming the Barren Valley
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Shenying
    This is an unnamed valley on the Kangzang Plateau, with a cold climate and frost for seven or eight months of the year. In the valley, which is more than twenty miles long, only a few Tibetan families live scattered about. This is the Bamei Village in Qianning County, Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xikang Province. Before liberation, large tracts of land here were barren, and the wilderness was desolate and silent, as if it had been abandoned.

    But, now look at the scene in this valley! The fields have just been harvested, some wheat stalks are still shining in the fields, and some have already been turned over with moist new soil. The Kangqing Highway, its surface whitened by the wheels of vehicles, runs through the valley, and many new buildings have appeared on both sides of the road. Here are the People's Bank of China, the state-owned trading company, and a meteorological observatory that studies the plateau climate; there is also the Qianning Agricultural and Pastoral Experimental Farm. Thousands of straight, thick logs are lined up on both sides of the road, and the sounds of workers sawing wood, using axes, and Tibetans breaking stones echo in the valley. Several nearby brick kilns are emitting thick smoke. Newly erected roofs are being covered with blue tiles; this is a large-scale restaurant that is under construction. It is gradually becoming a new town.

    In recent years, the Autonomous Region People's Government has led the landless and land-poor farmers of Bamei Village to reclaim wasteland, which has brought about fundamental changes in the lives of the Tibetan people. Of the 95 households in Bamei Village, 66 were originally landless or land-poor farmers. Because they have reclaimed wasteland, they have all settled down.

    In 1951, the Autonomous Region People's Government established an agricultural and pastoral experimental farm here, deciding to experiment with some high-quality agricultural and pastoral crops suitable for cold regions. The staff at the farm told me that in their first year here, they used backward Tibetan plows to reclaim wasteland, and sowed seeds like the Tibetans. Today, however, they are using new-style walking plows, seeders, and harvesters. The results of yield per unit area forecasts for this year show that wheat will increase by one and a half times compared to 1951, and highland barley will increase by more than 60 percent compared to 1951. They carefully study the properties of plateau soil and crop varieties, and grasp the laws of plateau climate change, and have successfully experimented with dozens of crops. The "Nanda 2419" wheat, which is cultivated on a large scale this year, can yield more than 600 catties per mu in high-yield land. In a green vegetable garden, you can see many vegetables that have never grown on the plateau before. In the pasture section, you can see that dozens of varieties of pasture grass that have been tested are four or five times higher than the wild pasture grass in the mountains. A kind of Soviet oats grows taller than a person. On the green slopes, flocks of white sheep graze. The Soviet Tsigai sheep introduced from the Chabei Pasture have wool that is dense and fine.

    The agricultural and pastoral experimental farm has greatly attracted the surrounding Tibetan farmers. Tibetan people have asked the agricultural and pastoral farm to exchange for high-quality varieties, and have asked the farm to use new agricultural implements to sow seeds for them. This spring plowing season, the farm exchanged more than 5,000 catties of wheat, highland barley, and pea seeds for the Tibetan people, which have grown luxuriantly in the valley. Now, the agricultural and pastoral farm is preparing tens of thousands of catties of high-quality crop varieties for the Tibetan people.

    Next to the large restaurant under construction is a row of low sheds. This is a temporary restaurant for receiving passing guests. This restaurant welcomes hundreds of cars every day. On a cold night in December 1952, after the Kangzang Highway opened to traffic in Qamdo, I took a vehicle from the transportation corps and arrived at this restaurant late at night. More than 50 vehicles were lined up on the highway in front of the restaurant, and hundreds of people crowded into the restaurant. Cooks were busy cooking rice and stir-frying dishes. Smoke filled the sheds, and the cold wind in the valley kept howling. Now, I listen to the stationmaster describe this delightful scene to me: The new building of more than 1,500 square meters includes a driver's dormitory with about 200 beds, a food department, a bathhouse, two dining halls, and rice storerooms, vegetable storerooms, and vegetable cutting rooms. All of this is with painted glass doors and windows, and will be completed by the end of this year. He also said with great enthusiasm that he plans to build a pig house, a sauce house, and open a vegetable garden in the future.

    The staff at the restaurant have overcome many difficulties in the past to support the troops entering Tibet and the road-building troops. They keep food and dishes constantly available from morning to night, and drivers and passing guests can eat here at any time. In the case of a shortage of vegetables, they can turn a kind of radish into four delicious dishes, and peanuts can be transformed into three or four kinds of dishes. The station's clerk said that the slogan they put forward is "Rice cooked well, dishes fragrant, build Kangzang."

    On the evening of my visit, the restaurant showed the film "The Soviet Red Flag Song and Dance Troupe in Our Country." The working cadres in the valley and many Tibetan men and women came here to watch. The lights illuminated the night, and laughter resounded in the valley.

    人们在改造着荒凉的山谷
    新华社记者  赵慎应
    这是康藏高原上的一个无名山谷，气候寒冷，一年有七、八个月的霜期。在二十多里长的山谷里，只散居着很少的藏族人家。这就是西康省藏族自治区乾宁县的八美村。解放前，这里大块土地荒芜着，荒野冷落沉寂，像被人遗弃了似的。
    但是，现在看看这山谷里的景象吧！刚刚收割过的田野，有的麦桩还在田里发着亮光，有的已经又翻起了润湿的新土。被车轮辗得发白的康青公路从山谷里穿过，公路两旁出现了许多新的建筑物，这里有中国人民银行、国营贸易公司和研究高原气候的气象台；还有乾宁农牧试验场。公路两旁排列着千百根笔直的又粗又长的木料，山谷里响着工人们的锯木声、斧子声和藏民们砸碎石的声音，附近几个砖瓦窑正在冒着浓烟。新架起来的房顶正在铺青瓦，这是在兴建中的一个规模宏大的饭站。这里正逐渐成为一个新的市镇。
    几年来自治区人民政府领导八美村无地缺地的农民开垦荒地，使藏族人民生活上起了根本变化。八美村现有的九十五户人家，有六十六户原来是无地缺地的农民，因开垦了荒地，都安居下来了。
   一九五一年，自治区人民政府在这里设立了一个农牧试验场，决定在这里试验出一些适合高寒地区的优良的农业、牧业作物。场里的工作人员告诉我，他们来到这里的第一年，使用落后的藏犁开垦了荒地，像藏民一样地撒下了种子，而今天他们使用的却是新式步犁、播种机和收割机了。今年农场部分单位面积产量预测的结果，小麦要比一九五一年增加一倍半，青稞比一九五一年增加百分之六十多。他们细心地研究高原土壤和作物品种的性质，掌握着高原气候变化的规律，已经试验成功了几十种作物。今年大面积栽培的“南大二四一九”小麦，丰产地每亩可收到六百多斤。在一片青绿的菜园里，可以看到许多高原上从未生长过的蔬菜。在牧场部分可以看到试种的数十种牧草比山野里的野生牧草要高出四、五倍，一种苏联种的燕麦长得比人还高。绿色的山坡上，牧放着成群的白绵羊。从察北牧场引进来的苏联茨盖种羊，羊毛又密又细。
    农牧试验场大大地吸引了周围的藏族农民。藏民纷纷向农牧场要求调换优良品种，并请场里用新式农具为他们播种。今年春耕时，场里换给藏民的五千多斤小麦、青稞和豌豆种子，播种在山谷中已经丰茂的生长起来。现在，农牧场又为藏民们准备着上万斤的优良作物品种。
    正在兴建中的大饭站旁边，是一排低矮的席棚，这是招待过往客人的临时饭站，这个饭站每天迎接着成百辆汽车。一九五二年十二月一个寒冷的夜间，康藏公路通车昌都后，我曾坐着运输部队的汽车，深夜来到这个饭站，五十多辆汽车横列在饭站前的公路上，几百个人拥在饭站里，炊事员们忙着煮饭炒菜，席棚里烟火弥漫，山谷里的寒风，不停的啸叫着。现在，我听着站长向我描述了这样令人喜悦的情景：一千五百多平方公尺的新建筑，包括着约二百个床位的驾驶员宿舍、一个食品部、一个澡塘、两个饭堂，还有米库、菜库、切菜间等，这一切都是油漆的玻璃门窗，今年年底就可全部建成。他还兴致勃勃地说，将来还准备修一个猪房、一个酱房，辟一个菜园。
    饭站上的工作人员过去曾克服了许多困难，支援了进藏部队和筑路部队。他们一天到晚保持饭菜不断，饭热菜暖，驾驶员和过往客人可以随时到这里吃到饭。在蔬菜缺乏的情况下，他们能把一种萝卜做成四样鲜美的菜，花生米也能变三、四种菜样。站上的事务长说，他们提的口号是“饭熟、菜香，建设康藏。”
    在我访问的当天晚上，饭站放映“苏联红旗歌舞团在我国”电影，山谷里的工作干部和许多男女藏民都来这里观看，灯光照亮了黑夜，欢笑声震响在山谷。
