    Striving for the Establishment of Collective Peace and Security in Asia
    Liu Ningyi, Member of the World Peace Council
    As long as the people of all countries unite and strive together, peace can be guaranteed.
    The international situation in the half-year since the World Peace Council's special meeting in Berlin has further proven this truth.
    If my memory serves me correctly, when we gathered in Berlin in May, the Geneva Conference had been going on for a full month, and the enemies of peace were using all their strength to obstruct and sabotage it, preventing the negotiations on the peaceful reunification of Korea from making an inch of progress. Warmongers were clamoring, "Let's quickly pack up the Geneva stall; the important thing is to start a war bloc in Southeast Asia first."
    As for the "European Army" plan, needless to say, it had to be pushed through no matter what.
    However, the wheels of history did not follow the cleverly arranged path of the warmongers, and the policy of strength once again hit a wall. The Geneva Conference finally reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, and the flames of war that had been burning in Asia for eight years were extinguished.
    Subsequently, the "European Army" plan, which aimed to revive German militarism, was declared bankrupt due to the opposition of people all over the world, especially the French people.
    Generally speaking, the international situation has begun to ease.
    Nevertheless, we should not be satisfied and relaxed because of the achievements we have already made, but should be more vigilant and work harder to further consolidate and expand the cause of defending peace. The signing of the Southeast Asia Treaty, the establishment of the London and Paris Agreements, and the brewing of the US-Chiang military alliance – these recent events indicate that the enemies of peace are not willing to give up and still want to maintain a tense situation and create war. It is of great significance that the World Peace Council is meeting at this time to review and discuss the most urgent issues related to world peace and to seek solutions.
    Regarding Asian issues, our Indian friends have already done a thorough analysis, and what I want to say now is about these issues.
    Everyone admits that the Geneva Conference's agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina has created a new hope for Asian countries and peoples. It not only ended another hot war in Asia but also created favorable conditions for establishing a zone of peace. Asian people are more convinced that, through their own efforts and sincere consultations, they can establish collective peace and security and, on this basis, safeguard national independence and develop their economies and cultures. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, affirmed in the two joint statements by the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma, are a concrete embodiment of this new hope.
    Premier Zhou Enlai of China pointed out in his first speech at the Geneva Conference that "Asian countries should consult with each other and work together to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations." Now, the four words "peaceful coexistence" have developed into the five simple and clear principles, which have received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of Asian people. Peaceful coexistence has become a huge popular force, and its five principles have become the bond of unity among Asian countries and peoples today.
    In June of this year, Premier Zhou Enlai of China visited New Delhi and Rangoon. In October, Prime Minister Nehru of India visited Beijing and met with President Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi. Now, Prime Minister U Nu of Burma will also set off to visit Beijing.
    Chinese government trade delegations went to Indonesia and India, respectively signing the trade protocol and payment agreement between China and Indonesia, and the trade agreement between China and India. The exchange of goods protocol on the implementation of the trade agreement between China and Burma has also been signed in Beijing.
    Among the guests who came to Beijing on October 1st to attend the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to government leaders and famous figures in the cultural and scientific circles from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, there were also parliamentarians and delegations from trade unions, women, youth, culture, and peace movements from Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Japan.
    After a delegation of Japanese Diet members, including representatives from all government and opposition parties in the Japanese Diet, visited China, a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross Society, headed by Ms. Li Dequan, visited Japan and was warmly welcomed by the Japanese people.
    The close contact and frequent exchanges between the governments and peoples of major Asian countries are unprecedented in Asian history. This is by no means accidental. Today, Asian people feel a common threat – war and division. They all have a common demand – peace and cooperation.
    Whether in New Delhi, Rangoon, Beijing, Jakarta, Hanoi, Colombo, Tokyo, or Karachi, all kind-hearted people are enthusiastically talking about collective peace and security.
    Regardless of how different the political systems, religious beliefs, lifestyles, and customs of these Asian countries may be, they share the common understanding that peaceful coexistence can be achieved based on the Five Principles.
    Equally encouraging for all peace-loving people is the joint declaration issued by the Soviet government delegation and the Chinese government during their visit to Beijing for the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The declaration stated that the two countries will continue to base their relations with Asian countries and countries in the Pacific region and other countries on strict adherence to the Five Principles. This opens up broad possibilities for the development of fruitful international cooperation. This shows that China and the Soviet Union are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries based on the Five Principles and are willing that other countries can also coexist peacefully based on the Five Principles.
    The joint declaration of China and the Soviet Union on the Japanese issue sincerely and frankly stated that the two countries are willing to see the Japanese people break away from their status of dependence on foreign countries, embark on the road of national rejuvenation, establish normal relations with other countries, especially with their two major neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, and develop extensive economic and cultural relations. However, the United States is still pursuing a policy of war, actively rearming Japan, supporting Japanese militarism, and dragging Japan into an aggressive bloc, which seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. From the perspective of the vital interests of the Japanese people, we have reason to believe that the principles of peaceful coexistence will be accepted by the Japanese people. The fact that Mr. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, who recently visited our country, stated that he would work to launch a movement to support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is proof of this.
    Precisely because the vital interests and urgent demands of the Asian people are to be free from foreign aggression and to have a guarantee of national independence; to be free from falling into hostile military blocs aimed at creating division and war, and to promote mutual peaceful cooperation; to be free from colonial plunder and enslavement, and to seek economic and cultural development and mutual exchange; the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can fully meet these interests and satisfy these demands. Regardless of the differences in the historical background and specific circumstances of Asian countries, the application of the Five Principles can completely bring peace and security to Asian countries and make them prosper and happy.
    There has been new development in the situation of peace in Asia, but this does not mean that there is no longer a threat of war and aggression in Asia. The US warmongering bloc has constantly attempted to intervene militarily in the new China from three aspects: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina, and to threaten peace in Asia. Now that the flames of war in Korea and Indochina have been extinguished one after another, the United States is intensifying its use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fleeing to Taiwan to expand the harassing and destructive war against the Chinese mainland and coastal islands, and plans to turn Taiwan into a general base for controlling Japan and invading Southeast Asia. The US fleet is still entrenched in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has become a den of traitors and pirates of China. Since 1950, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the support and encouragement of the United States, has carried out 8,220 air raids on the Chinese mainland and intercepted 67 merchant ships from Britain, Denmark, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Panama, Greece, West Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. These pirates have abducted the crew members of Soviet merchant ships to Taiwan and the crew members of Polish merchant ships to the United States. Even US military aircraft alone intruded into the airspace over the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, China, on six occasions on November 7th and 8th, totaling 50 sorties, carrying out armed provocations and once again seriously and openly violating China's airspace. Recently, US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson has been shuttling between Taiwan and Washington, preparing to sign a so-called "mutual security defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to occupy Taiwan forever. If this treaty is signed, it will inevitably make the situation in the Far East more tense and worse.
    Taiwan is Chinese territory, which is an indisputable fact. Liberating Taiwan Province and the coastal islands of China, which are Chinese territories, is China's sovereignty and internal affair.
    Now some people have come up with bizarre ideas such as putting Taiwan under UN "trusteeship", "neutralizing" Taiwan, and making Taiwan an "independent country". These people obliterate the right and wrong of international law, kneel before violence, and seek to maintain temporary "peace" in this way, while in essence legalizing the US occupation of Taiwan, permanently severing Chinese territory and enslaving the Chinese people of Taiwan Province. There is also a most unreasonable argument that the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan Province, is actually called China's "aggression" against Taiwan. From this, people can understand why the United States calls organizing armed overthrow of the legitimate government of Guatemala "defending freedom." This strange definition of calling black white can probably only be found in the dictionary of the US State Department.
    It should be pointed out that the US government's occupation of Taiwan, sheltering of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and carrying out of armed intervention are not only violating China's territorial sovereignty and interfering in China's internal affairs, but also increasing the threat of war in the Far East, intensifying the international situation, and preventing China and other relevant countries from enjoying the benefits of peace. It should be pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's occupation is a conspiracy to provoke a world war as their occupation. This small group of traitors is not only the enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world.
    In order to ease the tense situation and eliminate the threat of war against China, the US government must withdraw all its armed forces from Chinese territory and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The US government must bear full responsibility for a comprehensive conflict in the Far East caused by US interference in China's internal affairs.
    The Chinese people's determination to oppose the US occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs is unshakable. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle to defend world peace.
    The results of the Geneva Conference promoted further relaxation of international tensions. However, the US government and its puppet Syngman Rhee clique adopted a rude and unreasonable attitude of sabotage when discussing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, refusing to conduct consultations and fearing to reach an agreement. Finally, the US government manipulated some countries participating in the conference to issue a so-called "joint declaration," which caused the conference to be interrupted, so that the task of peacefully resolving the Korean issue could not be achieved. The Chinese people believe that it is entirely necessary to resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible under conditions that are conducive to the peaceful reunification of Korea and conducive to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    The Korean issue has not been erased from the agenda of the Geneva Conference. As long as the Korean issue is not resolved, as long as US troops do not withdraw, and as long as the Syngman Rhee clique continues to clamor for "northern expedition", the flames of war in Asia will one day reignite. The resolution of the Indochina issue has already provided a good precedent for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. As long as foreign troops are withdrawn and all-Korean people's elections are held under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the peaceful reunification of Korea can be quickly realized. Resuming the conference on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue as soon as possible is the demand of the Korean people, the demand of the Chinese people, and the common demand of the Asian people.
    The people of Asian countries are closely watching the development of the situation in Indochina after the Geneva Conference. The implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement for four months has generally been good. The Vietnam People's Army has withdrawn from South Vietnam. The soldiers of the resistance forces in Cambodia have completed their demobilization on the spot. Vietnamese volunteers in Cambodia and Laos have withdrawn to Vietnam. However, there are still incidents that undermine the armistice agreement. The US-made "Manila Treaty" placed Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam under the "protection" of the "Southeast Asia Defense Group", which is obviously the greatest destruction of the Geneva Agreement. Moreover, during the French-American negotiations held in Washington in September this year, it was decided to provide American economic and military assistance directly to the member states of the Indochina Federation, and the United States obtained the right to directly train the armed forces of South Vietnam, which means that the US warmongering bloc is actively intensifying military intervention in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. All countries that participated in the Geneva Conference on the restoration of peace in Indochina have an obligation to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Agreement. Therefore, the French people and the Asian people, who have a direct interest in peace in Indochina, cannot allow any acts that undermine the Geneva Agreement.
    Finally, we must seriously point out the greatest harm of the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" to peace in Asia. The signatories of this treaty, in addition to the three Asian countries that have military assistance agreements with the United States, are not Asian countries. Obviously, the organization established under this treaty is only a military alliance of colonial countries. This military alliance supports the US policy of hostility towards China and facilitates the US to invade Asian countries in all aspects. As Prime Minister Nehru said, this is a "sphere of influence manipulated by powerful countries," which makes Asian people hate each other and kill each other. The United States will also use the clause on "preventing subversive activities" to suppress the national independence movements of Asian countries and interfere in their internal affairs. However, it is clear that it is the US warmongering bloc itself that is plotting to create subversive activities in some countries. The United States will also use the clause on "economic measures" to plunder the strategic resources of the Southeast Asian region and enslave the people of this region.
    Recently, the United States is impatiently convening a conference of treaty countries before the countries participating in the treaty have ratified the treaty, in order to strengthen US control over these countries and threaten peace in Asia.
    The United States has already created the aggressive "US-Australia-New Zealand Treaty" and the "US-Philippines Military Assistance Agreement" in Asia, and created the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." Now it is creating the US-Chiang "Mutual Security Defense Treaty" and is preparing to create a "Northeast Asia Alliance" that includes Japan. What we Asian people demand is peaceful coexistence, but what the US warmongering bloc is doing in Asia is war and division, which is extremely contrary to the interests of the Asian people.
    Therefore, our current task is to unite more closely with all peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia, and work together to remove obstacles to establishing and expanding collective peace and security in Asia.
    (1) Stop the United States from continuing to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, oppose any unreasonable interference and obstruction in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, oppose the embargo policy that hinders trade between countries, and stop the piratical looting that undermines the freedom of navigation on the high seas. Restore the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and no longer allow members of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to impersonate representatives of the Chinese people in the United Nations.
    (2) Following the example of the Geneva Conference in resolving the Indochina issue, convene a conference with the participation of Asian neutral countries to resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible based on the principles of respecting the national rights of the Korean people and conducive to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
    (3) Strictly implement all agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina and stop all acts that directly or indirectly undermine the armistice agreement.
    (4) Resolutely oppose the aggressive "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty", oppose the rearmament of Japan and other military bloc plans aimed at creating division and war, and use the power of the peace movement in various countries to prevent the parliaments of relevant countries from passing any aggressive alliance treaties and military agreements.
    (5) Expand the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to Asian countries and countries outside Asia, so as to expand peace zones and establish collective peace and safety, promote the establishment of normal diplomatic relations, development of economic relations, and cultural relations between Asian countries, consolidate and develop mutual friendship among the peoples of Asian countries.
    The peace movement in Asian countries has gained new development. The people of India and Pakistan have done their best in the movement against the US-Pakistan military agreement, the Japanese people in the movement against the US hydrogen bomb test in Bikini, and the people of India, Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon and Korea have worked to promote the armistice in Indochina, and the people of all Asian countries have done their best in the movement against the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." We Chinese people will definitely contribute our greatest strength together with the people of all Asian countries and all peace-loving people in the world to establish collective peace and security in Asia and Europe.
    The Chinese people oppose any attempt to arm West Germany and continue military bloc policies in Europe, as this is a serious threat to peace in Europe and the world. We are willing to give full support to the struggle of the European people against the revival of German militarism and advocating consultations among major powers to resolve the issue of Germany's peaceful reunification. The Chinese people fully agree with and support the Soviet government's note to European countries, the United States, and the People's Republic of China on November 13, believing that convening an all-European conference at this time would be of great benefit to world peace.
    The Chinese people also oppose the ongoing colonial war policies and interference in the internal affairs of weak countries in Africa, Latin America, and other regions. We express our infinite sympathy and lofty respect to the people struggling for peace and national independence in these regions.
    The peace-loving forces of the world have formed a huge torrent, surging everywhere. Let all kind-hearted people unite and persevere in the struggle to ease the current international tensions and welcome our peace force conference next year!
    The mast of the big ship of collective peace and safety is emerging on the horizon. No matter how dangerous the wind and waves are, it cannot stop it from moving forward. Let us warmly applaud it!

    为建立亚洲集体和平和安全而奋斗
    世界和平理事会理事  刘宁一
    只要各国人民团结起来共同争取，和平是能够得到保证的。
    世界和平理事会柏林特别会议以后半年来所产生的国际局势更证明了这个真理。
    假如我的记忆不错，当五月间我们在柏林聚首的时候，日内瓦会议开了整整一个月，和平敌人正用一切力量进行阻挠和破坏，使朝鲜和平统一问题的谈判得不到一寸的进展，好战分子叫嚣着：“赶快把日内瓦的摊子收起吧，要紧的是在东南亚先搞起一个战争集团。”
    至于“欧洲军”计划，那还用说，那是非推行不可的了。
    但是，历史的车轮却并没有按照着好战分子所巧妙安排的路子走，实力政策又一次碰了壁。日内瓦会议终于就印度支那停战问题达成了协议，在亚洲燃烧了八年之久的战火被扑灭了。
    接着，以复活德国军国主义为目的的“欧洲军”计划，也由于全世界人民、特别是法国人民的反对而宣告破产。
    总的说来，国际局势是开始缓和下来了。
    虽然如此，我们仍然不应该因为已得的成就而满足和松懈起来，应该更加警惕和努力，以求得进一步地巩固和扩大保卫和平的事业。东南亚公约的签订，伦敦和巴黎协定的成立，美蒋军事同盟的酝酿，这些最近的事件表示着：和平敌人还不肯罢手，还想继续保持紧张局势，制造战争。世界和平理事会在这个时候开会来审查和讨论当前各项最急迫的有关世界和平的问题，寻求解决的途径，是具有重大意义的。
    在亚洲问题方面，我们的印度朋友已做了深刻的分析，我现在要说的也就是这些问题。
    谁都承认，日内瓦会议就印度支那停战达成协议这一件事，使亚洲国家和人民产生了一种新的希望。它不仅结束了亚洲的另一热战，并且为建立和平地区创造了有利的条件。亚洲人民更加相信，依照他们自己的努力，通过真诚的协商，就可以建立集体和平和安全，并在这一基础上维护民族独立和发展经济、文化。中印、中缅总理的两个联合声明所肯定的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，就是这种新的希望的具体体现。
    我国周恩来总理在日内瓦会议上发表的第一个演说，就已经指出：“亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全”。现在，“和平共处”这四个字发展成为既简单又明确的五项原则，得到亚洲广大人民的热烈支持。和平共处成为一种巨大的人民力量，其五项原则成了当前亚洲国家和人民团结的纽带了。
    今年六月，中国周恩来总理访问新德里和仰光。十月，印度总理尼赫鲁访问了北京，并在河内会见了胡志明主席。现在缅甸总理吴努也将启程访问北京。
    中国政府贸易代表团到了印度尼西亚和印度，分别签订了中国和印度尼西亚的贸易议定书和支付协定、中国和印度的贸易协定。中国和缅甸关于实现贸易协定的换货议定书也已在北京签订了。
    十月一日到北京参加中华人民共和国第五个国庆节的贵宾，除了苏联和其他人民民主国家政府领导人物及文化科学界的著名人士之外，还有印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰和日本等亚洲国家的国会议员和贸易、工会、妇女、青年、文化、和平运动的代表团。
    包括有日本国会所有政府党和反对党代表的日本国会议员访华团到中国以后，接着以李德全女士为首的中国红十字会代表团访问了日本，受到日本人民的热烈欢迎。
    亚洲主要国家的政府和人民彼此之间密切接触、频繁往来这种情况，是过去亚洲历史上所没有的。这绝不是偶然的。在今天，亚洲人民感受到一种共同的威胁——战争和分裂。他们都有一种共同的要求——和平和合作。
    不论是在新德里，在仰光，在北京，在雅加达，在河内，在科伦坡，在东京，在喀喇蚩，一切善良的人们都在热烈地谈论着集体和平和安全。
    不论这些亚洲国家的政治制度、宗教信仰、生活方式和风俗习惯彼此之间有多大的差异，他们对于根据五项原则可以获得和平共处的这一认识是共同的。
    同样为一切爱好和平的人们所欢欣鼓舞的，是苏联政府代表团在中华人民共和国国庆节访问北京期间，同中国政府共同发表的中苏两国联合宣言，宣言声明两国将继续把他们同亚洲国家和太平洋区域的各个国家以及其他国家的关系建立在严格遵守五项原则的基础之上。这样，就为发展有成果的国际合作开辟了广泛的可能。这说明了中苏两国愿意同一切国家根据五项原则和平共处，并愿意其他国家也能够根据五项原则和平共处。
    中苏两国关于日本问题的联合宣言，又诚恳坦率地表示，两国愿意看到日本人民摆脱依附外国的地位，踏上复兴祖国的道路，同其他国家、首先是同中苏两大邻邦建立正常关系，并发展广泛的经济合作和文化关系。但是，美国仍然推行战争政策，积极重新武装日本，扶持日本军国主义，把日本拉入侵略集团，严重威胁亚洲和世界和平。从日本人民的切身利益来说，我们有理由相信和平共处的原则将为日本人民所接受。不久以前到我国访问的日本左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎回国后就表示要为发动一个拥护和平共处五项原则的运动而努力，就是证明。
    正因为亚洲人民的切身利益和迫切要求，是要免于遭受外来侵略，得到民族独立的保证；是要免于堕入以制造分裂和战争为目的的敌对军事集团，促成互相的和平合作；是要免于殖民地掠夺和奴役，求得经济文化的发展和相互交流；和平共处的五项原则恰恰能够完全符合这些利益及满足这些要求。不管亚洲国家的历史背景和具体情况有怎样的差别，五项原则的应用是完全可以带给亚洲各国以和平和安全，并使他们获得繁荣和幸福的。
    亚洲和平的形势有了新的发展，但这并不是说亚洲已没有战争和侵略的威胁了。美国好战集团曾不断企图从台湾、朝鲜和印度支那三个方面来武装干涉新中国，并威胁亚洲和平。现在朝鲜和印度支那的战火已被先后扑灭，美国就更加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团扩大对中国大陆和沿海岛屿的骚扰性和破坏性的战争，并且计划变台湾为控制日本和侵略东南亚的总兵站。美国舰队仍旧盘踞在台湾海峡。台湾已成为中国的叛徒和海盗的巢穴。自一九五零年起，蒋介石卖国集团在美国支持和鼓励下曾空袭我国大陆八二二零架次，曾拦截英国、丹麦、挪威、意大利、荷兰、巴拿马、希腊、西德、波兰和苏联等国的商船六十七艘。这些海盗们曾将苏联商船的船员们劫往台湾，并将波兰共和国商船的船员劫往美国。甚至美国的军用飞机仅在十一月七、八两日就有六批五十架次侵入我国浙江省沿海地区上空，进行武装挑衅，再一次严重地公然侵犯我国领空。最近美国助理国务卿罗伯逊奔走台湾华盛顿之间，正在准备同蒋介石卖国集团签订一个所谓“共同安全防御条约”，企图永远占领台湾。这个条约如果签订的话，势必使远东局势更加紧张、更加恶化。
    台湾是中国的领土，这是不可争辩的事实。解放中国领土的台湾省和中国沿海岛屿，是中国的主权和内政。
    现在有人提出所谓把台湾交联合国“托管”、台湾“中立化”以及使台湾成为“独立国”等等出奇的说法。这些人抹煞国际法的是非，在强暴面前屈膝，这样来企求保持暂时的“和平”，而实质上使美国侵占台湾的行为合法化，永久割裂中国的领土和奴役台湾省的中国人民。还有一种最无理的说法，把中国人民解放他们自己的领土台湾省居然说成中国“侵略”台湾。由此人们可以了解，为什么美国把组织武装推翻危地马拉的合法政府名之为“保卫自由”了。这种说黑成白的奇怪定义，大概只有在美国国务院的字典上才能够查得出来。
    应该指出，美国政府侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，进行武装干涉，不仅是侵犯我国领土主权，干涉我国内政，而且是增加远东战争威胁，紧张国际局势，使中国和其他有关国家不能享受和平利益。应该指出，蒋介石卖国集团是以阴谋挑拨世界大战为他们的职业的，这一小撮卖国贼不仅是中国人民的公敌，而且是亚洲及世界各国爱好和平人民的公敌。
    为了缓和紧张局势和消除对中国的战争威胁，只有美国政府把它的一切武装力量从中国领土撤走，停止对中国内政的干涉。由于美国干涉中国内政而引起远东全面冲突，美国政府是要负全部责任的。
    中国人民反对美国侵占台湾和干涉中国内政的决心，是不可动摇的。中国人民解放台湾的斗争，就是保卫世界和平的斗争。
    日内瓦会议的结果，促进了国际紧张局势的进一步的缓和。但是，美国政府和他的傀儡李承晚集团，在讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的时候却采取了横蛮无理的破坏态度，拒绝进行协商，害怕达成协议。最后，美国政府更操纵参加会议的一部分国家发表了一个所谓“共同宣言”，使会议陷于中断，以致未能实现和平解决朝鲜问题的任务。中国人民认为，在保证有利于朝鲜的和平统一、有利于保障亚洲及世界和平的条件下，从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题是完全必要的。
    日内瓦会议的议程上并没有抹掉朝鲜问题。朝鲜问题一天没有得到解决，美国军队一天不撤退，李承晚集团一天仍然叫嚣“北伐”，亚洲的战争火焰就有一天会重新燃烧起来。印度支那问题的解决已经给了和平解决朝鲜问题一个良好的前例。只要撤退外国军队，在中立国监察委员会监督之下进行全朝鲜人民的选举，就可以迅速地实现朝鲜的和平统一。从速重开和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，这是朝鲜人民的要求，中国人民的要求，也是亚洲人民的共同要求。
    亚洲各国人民正密切注视日内瓦会议后的印度支那情况的发展。印度支那停战协定四个月的执行情况，一般说是良好的。越南人民军已撤离了南越。柬埔寨的抗战部队的战士已完成了就地复员的工作。在柬埔寨及老挝的越南志愿人员已撤回越南。但是，破坏停战协定的事件仍然是有的。美国制造的“马尼拉条约”，把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部划进“东南亚防务集团”的“保护”范围，这显然是对日内瓦协定的最大破坏。而且，今年九月间在华盛顿举行的法美谈判，决定将美国的经济和军事援助直接交给印度支那联邦成员国，美国并取得直接训练越南南部武装部队的权利，这就意味着美国好战集团对于越南南部、老挝和柬埔寨积极加紧军事干涉。所有参加关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议的国家，都负有义务保证日内瓦协定的贯彻。因此，与印度支那的和平有直接利益的法国人民和亚洲人民，是不能允许任何破坏日内瓦协定的行为的。
    最后，我们要严重指出所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”对于亚洲和平的最大危害性。这个条约的签订者除了三个同美国订有军事援助协定的亚洲国家以外，都不是亚洲国家。很显然，根据这个条约建立起来的组织，只是殖民国家的一个军事同盟。这个军事同盟支持美国敌视中国的政策，并且便利美国从各方面来侵略亚洲国家。正像尼赫鲁总理所说的一样，这是一种“由强国来操纵的势力范围”，它使亚洲人民互相仇视，互相残杀。美国还将利用
  “防止颠覆活动”的条款，来镇压亚洲各国的民族独立运动和干涉这些国家的内政。但是，谁都清楚，在某些国家阴谋制造颠覆活动的正是美国好战集团自己。美国还将利用“经济措施”的条款来搜刮东南亚地区的战略资源和奴役这个地区的人民。
    最近美国迫不及待地不等参加条约的国家对于这个条约的批准，就要召开条约国会议，来加强美国对于这些国家的控制和威胁亚洲和平。
    美国已经在亚洲制造了侵略性的“美澳新公约”和“美巴军事援助协定”，又制造了“东南亚集体防务条约”，现在正在制造美蒋“共同安全防御条约”，还准备制造把日本拉在内的“东北亚联盟”。我们亚洲人民所要求的是和平共处，而美国好战集团在亚洲所搞的却是极端违背亚洲人民利益的战争和分裂。
    因此，我们当前的任务是：更紧密地团结亚洲一切爱好和平的国家和人民，共同努力为建立和扩大亚洲集体和平和安全扫除障碍。
    （一）制止美国继续侵占中国的领土台湾，反对采取任何方式对中国人民解放台湾进行无理的干涉和阻挠，反对妨碍各国贸易的禁运政策，并制止破坏公海航行自由的海盗打劫行为，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位和权利，不能再允许蒋介石卖国集团分子在联合国冒充中国人民的代表。
    （二）仿照日内瓦会议解决印度支那问题的榜样，召开有亚洲中立国参加的会议，根据尊重朝鲜人民的民族权利和有利于保障亚洲和世界和平的原则，从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。
    （三）严格执行关于印度支那停战的各项协议，制止直接间接破坏停战协议的一切行为。
    （四）坚决反对侵略性的“东南亚集体防务条约”，反对重新武装日本和其他以制造分裂和战争为目的的军事集团计划，要运用各国和平运动的力量制止有关各国国会通过任何侵略性的同盟条约和军事协定。
    （五）把和平共处的五项原则扩大到亚洲各国和亚洲以外的国家，以扩大和平地区，建立集体和平和安全，推动亚洲国家建立正常的外交关系，发展经济关系及文化关系，巩固和发展亚洲各国人民的相互友谊。
    亚洲国家的和平运动已得到新的发展。印度人民和巴基斯坦人民在反对美巴军事协定的运动上，日本人民在反对美国在比基尼的氢弹试验的运动上，印度、印度尼西亚、日本、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰、朝鲜的人民在促成印度支那的停战的活动上，以及所有亚洲国家的人民在反对“东南亚集体防务条约”的运动上，都尽了最大的努力。我们中国人民一定同亚洲各国人民一道，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民一道，为在亚洲和欧洲建立集体和平和安全而贡献出最大的力量。
    中国人民反对武装西德以及在欧洲继续军事集团政策的任何企图，因为这是对于欧洲及世界和平的严重威胁。我们对于欧洲人民为反对德国军国主义复活和主张大国协商解决德国和平统一问题所进行的斗争，愿以全力支持。中国人民完全同意和支持苏联政府十一月十三日致欧洲各国、美国和中华人民共和国的照会，认为在这个时机召开全欧会议会对于世界和平有极大利益。
    中国人民也反对在非洲、拉丁美洲和其他地区正在进行的殖民主义战争政策和对弱小国家的内政干涉。对于在这些地区内为争取和平和民族独立而斗争的人们，我们表示无限的同情和崇高的敬意。
    全世界爱好和平的力量已经形成了一个巨流，到处汹涌澎湃着。一切善良的人们团结起来，坚持斗争，以便缓和当前国际紧张局势并迎接我们明年的和平力量大会！
    集体和平和安全的大船的桅顶冒出在地平线上了，风浪不论怎样险恶，都不能阻止它前进。让我们热烈鼓掌欢迎它吧！
