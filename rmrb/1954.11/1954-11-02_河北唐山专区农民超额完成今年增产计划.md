Farmers in Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, have exceeded this year's production increase plan by 20.9 percent, with a total increase of one billion jin of grain compared to 1953. In "Jidong Granary" - Leting County, the average yield of various grain crops reached 327 jin per mu; in Fengrun County, the 560,000 mu of corn averaged 481 jin per mu. The special district's 820,000 mu of cotton fields and 1,190,000 mu of peanuts also exceeded the plan, increasing by more than 40 percent compared to 1952, the year with the highest historical yield.

To ensure the realization of this year's grain and cotton production increase plans, the farmers in Tangshan Special District made great efforts. After the beginning of summer, more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 72,000 mutual aid teams in the special district led the vast number of farmers to launch a production increase competition, universally strengthened the later-stage management of crops, and carried out topdressing, soil cultivation, and shallow hoeing on 9,560,000 mu of field crops. Some corn was also artificially pollinated. Farmers in low-lying areas also waged a tenacious struggle against this year's waterlogging disasters. In Funing and Leting counties alone, 1,504 large and small drainage ditches were dug to promptly drain accumulated water and ensure increased agricultural production. During the autumn harvest, farmers in the special district universally adopted the method of careful harvesting and threshing, resulting in an additional harvest of more than 15 million jin of grain.

    河北唐山专区农民超额完成今年增产计划
    河北省唐山专区农民，超额百分之二十点九完成了今年的增产计划，全专区总共比一九五三年增产了十亿斤粮食。“冀东粮仓”——乐亭县，今年各种粮食作物的平均产量达三百二十七斤；丰润县五十六万亩玉蜀黍每亩平均达到四百八十一斤。全专区的八十二万亩棉田、一百一十九万亩花生，也超额完成了计划，比历史上产量最高的一九五二年增产百分之四十以上。
    唐山专区农民，为了保证今年粮、棉增产计划的实现，曾作了很大努力。入夏以后，全专区四千多个农业生产合作社和七万两千多个互助组带动广大农民掀起了增产竞赛，普遍加强了农作物的后期管理，九百五十六万亩大田作物都进行了追肥、培土和浅锄，有些玉米还进行了人工辅助授粉。低洼地区的农民，又同今年的积水灾害进行了顽强的斗争，仅抚宁、乐亭两县就挖大小泄水沟一千五百零四道，及时排除了积水，保证了农业增产。在秋收中，全专区农民普遍采用了精收细打的收获办法，因而又多收了一千五百多万斤粮食。
