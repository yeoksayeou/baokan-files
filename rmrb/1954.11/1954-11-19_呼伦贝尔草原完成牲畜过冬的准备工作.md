    Hulunbuir Grassland Completes Preparations for Livestock Overwintering
    Xinhua News Agency: On November 10th, the Hulunbuir Grassland in northern Inner Mongolia experienced its second snowfall. Herdsmen of various banners (counties) have basically completed winter disaster prevention preparations for livestock and are about to move over one million head of livestock of all sizes into winter pastures to overwinter.
    Since the summer, herdsmen of various banners in the Hulunbuir League have launched a disaster prevention and livestock protection campaign. Throughout the summer and autumn, herdsmen have been leading their livestock on "Aote'er" (nomadic grazing) in pastures with abundant water and grass. The condition of various livestock has surpassed that of last year, with some reaching full膘 (fattened). Herdsmen also widely organized haymaking mutual aid groups, using horse-drawn hay mowers and rakes to store over 240 million catties of fodder, an increase of 40% over last year. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives purchased large quantities of soybean cake, millet, cornmeal, and other miscellaneous grains from agricultural areas to supply herdsmen for supplementary feeding of weak livestock.
    Before winter, herdsmen in various banners built many new livestock sheds. The Solon Banner built 960 warm sheds and more than 3,300 livestock pens; the New Barag Right Banner constructed sheds, pens, and windbreak earth walls this year.

    呼伦贝尔草原完成牲畜过冬的准备工作
    十一月十日，内蒙古北部呼伦贝尔草原上第二次降雪，各旗牧民已基本上完成冬季牲畜防灾准备工作，即将把一百多万头大小牲畜移入冬季牧场过冬。
    呼伦贝尔盟各旗牧民从夏季开始就展开了防灾保畜运动。牧民们在整个夏季和秋季，一直带领牲畜在水草丰盈的牧场上走“敖特尔”（游牧），各种牲畜的膘情都超过了去年，部分牲畜已达到满膘。牧民们还普遍组织打草互助组，使用马拉打草机和搂草机割储了二亿四千多万斤饲草，比去年多储草百分之四十。国营商业部门和供销合作社从农业区购进大量的豆饼、小米和玉米面等杂粮，供应牧民贴喂瘦弱牲畜。
    入冬前，各旗牧民给畜群建造了许多新的畜舍。索伦旗盖暖棚九百六十座、畜圈三千三百多所；新巴尔虎右翼旗，今年修建了棚圈和防风雪用的土墙。　　　（新华社）
