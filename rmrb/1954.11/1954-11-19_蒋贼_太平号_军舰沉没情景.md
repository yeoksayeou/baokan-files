Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 18th -- Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding a certain frontline island personally witnessed the pathetic scene of the Jiang bandit's "Taiping" escort destroyer sinking. The following is their account:

    After dawn on the 14th, on the turbulent sea northeast of Dachen Island, a Jiang bandit warship was towing the gradually sinking "Taiping" escort destroyer, slowly moving south. Beside it, several Jiang bandit warships and gunboats were frantically circling back and forth. At this time, the bow of the "Taiping" had already sunk into the water, and only a little bit of the bridge remained visible on the sea surface. The mast, full of flags, was tilted like the barrel of a half-raised anti-aircraft gun.

    At 7:15 AM, the bridge of the "Taiping" had completely sunk into the sea, and only the top of the mast remained visible on the sea surface. At that time, the Jiang bandit warship towing it towards Dachen Island hurriedly released the iron cable. Once the Jiang bandit "Taiping" warship lost its support, the stern section, which was sticking out of the water, quickly sank into the sea. The panic-stricken Jiang bandits on the ship jumped into the water to escape, and many black dots immediately floated on the surrounding sea. At 7:30 AM, this American-made, 1,430-ton Jiang bandit "Taiping" escort destroyer completely sank to the bottom of the sea.

    At this time, the Jiang bandit troops on the signal station of Dachen Island were still frantically using flag signals, because the Jiang bandit gunboats and barges anchored in the anchorage were all frightened and covered with anti-aircraft camouflage, scurrying around near Dachen Island. It was not until after 10:00 AM that the Jiang bandit troops on Dachen Island gradually calmed down from their panic.

    蒋贼“太平号”军舰沉没情景
    【新华社浙江前线十八日电】守卫在某前哨岛屿上的中国人民解放军战士们亲眼看到了蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰沉没的狼狈景象，下面是他们的叙述。
    十四日天明后，在波涛汹涌的大陈岛东北海面上，有一艘蒋贼军舰拖着逐渐下沉的“太平号”护航驱逐舰，缓慢地向南移动，在它旁边，还有几艘蒋贼军舰和炮艇在慌乱地来回打转。这时，“太平号”的舰头已经沉进水里，驾驶台只剩下一点点痕迹露在海面上，那根挂满旗帜的桅杆，倾斜得好像一门半升起的高射炮的炮筒。
    七时十五分，“太平号”的驾驶台已经全部沉入海里，那根桅杆只剩下一个顶端露在海面上。那时在前面拖着它向大陈岛爬行的那艘蒋贼军舰慌忙地松开了铁索。蒋贼“太平号”军舰一失去依托，翘在水面上的舰尾部分就迅速地沉到大海里去了，舰上惊慌失措的蒋贼军纷纷跳水逃命，周围海面上立即浮起了很多黑点子。七时三十分，这艘美国造的一千四百三十吨的蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰就全部沉入海底了。
    这时大陈岛信号台上的蒋贼军还在慌乱地打着旗语，因为停泊在锚地里的蒋贼军炮艇和驳船，都吓得披上了防空伪装，在大陈岛附近乱窜。直到上午十点多钟，大陈岛上蒋贼军才从慌乱中逐渐沉寂下来。
