    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st] Two hundred thousand working people of Pyongyang held mass rallies in the Central, Eastern, and Western districts on October 31st, warmly supporting the call of the 8th session of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly for a peaceful resolution of the issue of national reunification through consultations between North and South Korea.
    At noon on the 31st, the venues in each district were packed with people. Participating in the mass rallies were workers, suburban farmers, government employees, women, students, cultural and educational workers, artists, scientists, industrialists, merchants, and religious figures. The crowds held aloft huge banners with slogans such as: "The Korean question must be resolved peacefully!" "The Korean people demand to live in a unified and independent land!" "Strive for the reunification and independence of the motherland!" Countless colorful flags waved in the dazzling sunlight. People shouted slogans such as "We must peacefully reunify the motherland!" This loud cry, transmitted through loudspeakers on the streets and alleys, reached every household and resounded throughout the city.
    At the mass rallies in each district, leading cadres of Pyongyang conveyed the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly. The masses responded with thunderous applause and cheers, warmly supporting and endorsing the just proposition of the appeal.
    People from all walks of life who participated in the conference took the stage to speak, expressing their determination to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Kim Bong-rye, a worker at the Pyongyang Textile Factory and a Labor Hero, said at the Eastern District rally: The lives of the people in the northern half of our country are constantly improving, but in the southern half, more than 1.3 million unemployed people are wandering the streets, and the people are groaning in hunger and poverty. We must further strengthen the struggle, work hard to complete and overfulfill the Three-Year Plan for the rehabilitation and development of the national economy after the war, and take practical actions to strive for the early realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    In the past two days, the newspaper poster boards on Pyongyang's main thoroughfares have been particularly crowded, and even women carrying their children to the market to buy groceries have been carefully reading the appeal. In factories, government offices, and schools, "peaceful reunification of the motherland" has become a topic of universal discussion. Parents, wives, and relatives of those who were abducted to South Korea by the American and Li bandit gangs and have not been heard from for more than four years expressed their heartfelt support when they saw or heard the appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly. People said in unison: The appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly expresses the aspirations in their hearts.

    拥护最高人民会议和平统一朝鲜的号召
    平壤市二十万人举行盛大集会
    【新华社平壤一日电】平壤市二十万劳动人民在十月三十一日分别在中区、东区和西区举行群众大会，热烈拥护朝鲜最高人民会议第八届会议关于以南北朝鲜协商方式和平解决祖国统一问题的号召。
    三十一日中午，各区的会场挤得人山人海。参加群众大会的有工人、郊区农民、机关人员、妇女、学生、文化教育工作者、艺术家、科学家、工商界和宗教界人士等。群众的队列里高举着巨幅标语牌，上面写着：“朝鲜问题必须和平解决！”“朝鲜人民要求在统一、独立的国土上生活！”“为争取祖国的统一和独立而斗争！”无数面各色鲜艳的旗帜在夺目的阳光下挥动。人们高呼着“一定要和平统一祖国”等口号。这个宏亮的呼声，通过大街小巷的扩音器，传达到家家户户，响遍了全城。
    在各区的群众大会上，分别由平壤市的负责干部传达了最高人民会议的号召书。群众用雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声，热烈拥护和支持号召书的正义主张。
    参加大会的各阶层人民纷纷登台发言，表示要为实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。平壤纺织工厂工人、劳动英雄金凤礼在东区大会上发言说：我们祖国北半部人民的生活每天都在不断提高，但在南半部有一百三十多万名失业者在街头流浪，人民在饥饿和贫困中呻吟。我们必须进一步加强斗争，努力完成和超额完成战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划，以实际行动争取早日实现祖国的和平统一。
    这两天，平壤市通衢大道的报纸招贴牌前显得格外拥挤，连背着孩子上街买菜的妇女也在那里仔细地阅读着号召书。在工厂、机关和学校里，“和平统一祖国”成了人们一致谈论的话题。那些被美李匪帮掳到南朝鲜去、四年多不通音讯的人的父母、妻子和亲人，在看到或听到最高人民会议号召书时，更是由衷地表示拥护。人们异口同声地说：最高人民会议的号召书表达了自己心坎里的意愿。
