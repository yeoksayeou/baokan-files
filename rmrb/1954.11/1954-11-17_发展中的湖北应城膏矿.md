Developing Plaster Mine in Yingcheng, Hubei
Ji Zhuoru

The Yingcheng Plaster Mine in Hubei Province is currently the largest and best quality gypsum mine in China. The gypsum it produces is white, transparent, solid, delicate, and fibrous, containing 98% calcium sulfate. Gypsum has a wide range of uses, mainly as fertilizer for farmland and as a raw material for cement manufacturing. Other chemical reagents, porcelain, paint coloring, cosmetics, art models, toothpaste, etc., also require it. Yingcheng's gypsum sells well in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and the North China, Northeast, and Southwest regions.

For a hundred years before liberation, bureaucratic capitalists colluded with local bullies, landlords, and feudal foremen to cruelly plunder the mining area, and the miners lived a miserable slave-like life. A miner named Zhou Zao'ya told me that he was forced to be lowered into the well with ropes to drag gypsum from the age of nine. The tunnels underground were very small. The hammer workers used chisels to hammer the gypsum off the working surface, which was less than eight inches high, tied the gypsum to their waists with ropes, and crawled on the ground to transport the gypsum out. Once miners were lowered into the well, they were not allowed to come up for three or four months, or even half a year or a whole year. Zhou Zao'ya also remembers that when he was ten years old, he was lowered into the well on the sixth day of the first lunar month and was not released until the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month; after being up for less than four or five days, he was forced to be lowered into the well again. Because they could not see the sun for a long time underground, the hair on the workers' bodies turned white, and they would faint as soon as they saw the sun when they came up. Underground, the feudal foremen only gave the workers some thin porridge and barley paste to eat every day. When the workers' hair grew long, they had to burn it with fire or cut it with scissors themselves. At night, the workers could only lie naked on the damp rocks for a while. Zhou Zao'ya himself had not had a quilt for fourteen years in a row. If the gypsum production was low on any given day, the feudal foremen would also use various instruments of torture to beat the miners. In this harsh environment, countless miners were deprived of their health and lives.

After liberation, the People's Government acquired three old mines and rescued nearly two thousand employees from harsh working conditions. In order to develop production and thoroughly improve the workers' working conditions, the People's Government has successively closed these three old mines and started the construction of the new mine in a plain north of Yingcheng in 1950. With the development of the country's industrial and agricultural production, the production of the mining area is also constantly improving. Comrade Ye Deting, the secretary of the mining area's Party committee, told me that if the gypsum production in 1952 is taken as 100, this year's production is 260. The production plan for next year is about twice this year's production. In order to fundamentally change the heavy and backward production methods of the mining area for more than a hundred years, Yingcheng Plaster Mine has decided to gradually move towards mechanization. Next year, the main production process of the mining area will gradually be replaced by machines instead of manual labor.

I visited this 178-meter-deep new mine with Chen Xianying, an engineer from the mining area. We went down by steam winch, just like taking an elevator in a big city, and we smoothly reached the bottom of the well in less than a minute. The underground is full of spider web-like tunnels. The main tunnels are two meters high and more than two meters wide. In the wide tunnels, electric lights illuminate the walls. Light rails have been laid in the tunnels, and mine cars are busy coming and going. Four 25-horsepower electric winches hoist gypsum from various working surfaces into the main tunnel, and the miners then send it to the wellhead and transport it to the wellhead by steam winch. The huge ventilator that is being opened keeps the air circulating underground, and people do not feel like they are in the bottom of a well that is nearly two hundred meters deep.

We stopped in front of a gypsum mining workplace and saw a small, exquisite iron thing like a small tank, crawling forward completely automatically along the light rail, using its sharp teeth to gnaw off the hard rock. Engineer Chen introduced to me: This is the first rock cutting machine successfully trial-produced by him and the workers during the technical innovation movement, based on the principle of the Soviet "coal cutting machine" and combined with the characteristics of the mine. According to preliminary identification: the rock cutting machine can replace the operation of twelve hammer workers, and the production is about three times higher than manual production.

The hammer worker Wang Jinlong, who started dragging gypsum in the well at the age of seven, has now become the leader of the rock cutting team. He excitedly pointed to the rock cutting machine and said:
"In the past, we used manual mining, and we could only hit about three square meters a day at most, and we were so tired that our backs ached and our arms were sore. Now, we have rock cutting machines, and the production has changed greatly. In the future, if we use rock cutting machines entirely, that will be even better!"

Under the education of the Party committee of the mining area, the production enthusiasm of the miners has been greatly improved. Before the miners switched to machine production, they put forward many rationalization proposals to improve manual production. The underground assembly line operation method created by the Pan Mu'an advanced team of hammer workers increased work efficiency by 30%; the transportation workshop improved sectional transportation twice, increasing work efficiency by 33%; other methods such as water spraying rock drilling, rapid tunneling, and hollow blasting have also greatly increased work efficiency. The average work efficiency of hammer workers this year is 120% higher than in 1952; the average daily output of the mining area this year is 246% higher than in 1952; if compared with 1950, it is 417% higher. Due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the cost of the gypsum factory in September this year was 54.22% lower than in 1951.

The hard work of the miners has also brought them a happy life. In the past three years, the mining area has spent more than 7.2 billion yuan on employee labor protection, welfare, culture, education, and health. The mining area has built 300 new dormitories for employees, and established sanatoriums, medical stations, cooperatives, bathrooms, canteens (including underground canteens), clubs, employee spare-time schools, and employee children's schools. Of the 283 workers who went to the sanatorium for recuperation, 274 have recovered their health and returned to work. Due to the gradual increase in miners' wages, many miners have bought watches, and some have even bought bicycles, radios, and cameras. More than 670 miners participated in spare-time school studies, and the broadcasting room and blackboard newspaper can often receive submissions from workers; some workers can also write short scripts and perform through their own amateur theater groups. Every noon and afternoon, miners engage in various cultural and recreational activities. Loudspeakers report new people and new things in daily production to everyone and broadcast beautiful and pleasant music. The library and recreation room are full of people reading newspapers and playing poker. On the basketball court, teams organized by the miners themselves often conduct friendly matches.

Currently, the employees of Yingcheng Plaster Mine are actively carrying out labor competitions to increase the production of 13,800 tons of gypsum. Technicians are busy rushing to make blueprints for gradually realizing the mechanization of production in the mining area and improving production equipment. On Shengjiatan, five miles north of the mining area, drilling rigs are exploring new gypsum seams towards the earth's core, which indicates that another mine will be established there.

    发展中的湖北应城膏矿
    纪卓如
    湖北应城膏矿是我国目前产量最大、质量最好的一个石膏矿。它出产的石膏洁白透明、坚实细腻、带有纤维体，内含水硫酸钙百分之九十八。石膏的用途很广，主要是用作农田的肥料和制造水泥的原料，其他化学药剂、瓷器、油漆调色、化妆品、美术模型、牙膏等，也都少不了它。应城的石膏畅销湖北、湖南、江苏、浙江、江西、安徽，以及华北、东北、西南一带。
    解放前的一百年来，官僚资本家勾结着当地的恶霸、地主、封建把头，对矿区进行了残酷的掠夺，矿工们过着悲惨的奴隶式的生活。一位名叫周早伢的矿工告诉我：他从九岁起，就被迫用绳子吊下井去拖石膏。井下的巷道非常矮小，捶工们在不到八公寸高的工作面上，把石膏用凿子一锤一锤地打下来，用绳子把石膏系在自己的腰上，再爬在地上把石膏拖运出去。矿工们一被放下井去，就是三、四个月甚至半年、整年都不准上来。周早伢还记得在他十岁的那年，正月初六吊下井去，一直到腊月二十八才放出来；刚上来不到四、五天，又被迫放下井去了。因为在井下长期不能见到阳光，工人身上的汗毛都变成了白色，上井来一见到太阳就要晕倒。在井下，封建把头每天只给工人一些稀粥和大麦糊子吃。工人们的头发长长了，要自己用火烧或用剪子剪。晚上，工人们只能光着身子歪在潮湿的岩石上睡一下。周早伢自己一连十四年就没有盖过被子。要是有一天石膏出少了，封建把头还要用各种刑具来毒打矿工。在这种恶劣的环境中，无数矿工被夺去了健康和生命。
    解放以后，人民政府收购了三个旧矿井，把近两千名的职工从恶劣的劳动条件下拯救出来。为了发展生产，彻底改善工人劳动条件，人民政府已先后停办了这三个旧井，并从一九五○年开始，在应城北面的一片平原上开建了现在的新矿。随着国家工、农业生产的发展，矿区的生产也在不断提高。矿区党委书记叶德亭同志告诉我：以一九五二年的石膏产量为一百，今年的生产就是二百六十。明年的生产计划约为今年生产的两倍。为了从根本上改变矿区一百多年来笨重、落后的生产方法，应城膏矿已经确定逐步走向机械化。明年，矿区的主要生产过程，将逐步用机器来代替手工作业。
    我随矿区陈显颖工程师参观了这个一百七十八公尺深的新矿井。我们乘蒸汽绞车下去，就像在大城市里坐电梯一样，不要一分钟工夫就平稳地下到了井底。井下布满了蜘蛛网一般的巷道。大巷有两公尺高，两公尺多宽。在宽大的巷道里，电灯照得四壁通明。巷道里都铺上了轻便铁轨，矿车忙碌地来往奔驰。四部二十五马力的电绞车，分别从各个工作面上把石膏绞到大巷里来，矿工们再把它送到井口边，用蒸汽绞车运上井口。正在开放的巨大的抽风机，使井下空气畅通，人们毫不觉得是置身在将近二百公尺的井底。
    我们走到一个开采石膏的工作面前停下，看到了一部小巧玲珑的、像小坦克似的铁家伙，正沿着轻便铁轨完全自动地向前爬行，用它锋利的牙齿啃掉坚硬的岩石。陈工程师向我介绍：这就是在技术革新运动中，他和工人们一道根据苏联“截煤机”的原理，并结合该矿的特点试制成功的第一部割岩机。据初步鉴定：割岩机可以代替十二个捶工的操作，比手工生产约提高了三倍。
    从七岁就开始下井拖石膏的捶工王金龙，现在已经成了割岩组的组长。他兴奋地指着割岩机说：
  “过去我们用手工开采，一天最多能打三平方公尺左右，而且累得腰酸臂痛。现在，我们有了割岩机，生产上大改变了。将来我们全部改用割岩机，那就更好啦！”
    在矿区党委的教育下，矿工们的生产热情大大地提高了。矿工们在没有改用机器生产以前，提出了很多合理化建议来改进手工生产。捶工潘木安先进小组创造的井下流水作业法，提高了工作效率百分之三十；运输车间两次改进分段运输，提高了工作效率百分之三十三；其他如喷水打岩法、快速掘进法、空心爆破法等，也都大大提高了工作效率。捶工今年的平均工作效率比一九五二年提高了百分之一百二十；矿区今年的平均日产量，比一九五二年提高了百分之二百四十六；要是跟一九五○年比较，提高了百分之四百一十七。由于劳动生产率的不断提高，今年九月份的石膏工厂成本，比一九五一年降低了百分之五十四点二二。
    矿工们的辛勤劳动，也为自己带来了幸福的生活。三年多来，矿区光用在职工劳保福利、文教卫生方面的费用，就有七十二亿多元。矿区为职工们新建了三百间宿舍，设立了疗养所、医疗站、合作社、浴室、食堂（还有井下食堂）、俱乐部、职工业余学校、职工子弟学校等。到疗养所休养的二百八十三位工人，已经有二百七十四人恢复了健康，从新回到工作岗位。由于矿工工资的逐步提高，很多矿工都买了手表，还有的自备有脚踏车、收音机和照相机。矿工参加业余学校学习的有六百七十多名，广播室和黑板报经常可以收到工人的稿件；有的工人还可以写简短的剧本，通过自己的业余剧团演出。每到中午和下午，矿工们就进行各种文化娱乐活动。扩音器向大家报告一天生产的新人新事，播送优美动听的音乐。图书室、康乐室坐满了看报和玩扑克的人们。篮球场上，矿工们自己组织的球队时常进行友谊比赛。
    现在，应城膏矿职工正为增产一万三千八百吨石膏而积极开展劳动竞赛。技术员正忙着为逐步实现矿区生产机械化而赶制改进生产设备的蓝图。靠矿区北面五里路的盛家滩上，钻探机正向地心探索新的石膏矿层，它预示着另一座矿井将在那里建立起来。
