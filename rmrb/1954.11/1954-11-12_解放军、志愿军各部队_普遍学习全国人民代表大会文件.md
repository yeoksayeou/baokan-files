In October, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice to the entire army regarding conveying and studying the documents of the NPC session. The notice emphasized that when studying the documents, it is necessary to combine them with the troops' thinking and specific tasks in order to enhance the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of commanders and fighters, promote various tasks, and complete combat missions. According to the notice of the General Political Department, all PLA units universally launched activities to convey and study the documents in October. Representatives to the NPC from various military regions and branches of service have separately reported to the cadres of the various military region organs and units on the situation and documents of the First Session of the First NPC. Tang Liang, Deputy Political Commissar of the East China Military Region, called on commanders and fighters in his report to study the documents diligently, take practical actions to actively strengthen national defense construction, resolutely shoulder the glorious task of defending the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, safeguarding national security and territorial integrity, and resolutely struggle to complete the glorious duty of liberating Taiwan.

In order to enable the broad masses of commanders and fighters to effectively study the various documents, leading cadres of many units in various military regions have personally made study reports to their subordinate units. The Northeast Military Region also compiled popular speaking materials for the soldiers of its subordinate units to study. The Central South Military Region also compiled a collection of documents from the NPC session and distributed it to its subordinate units. The leading organs of many units have allocated films about the First Session of the First NPC, the general election, and the achievements of the motherland's construction over the past five years to be shown to the troops. Many units' wired broadcasting stations have organized various broadcasting programs related to the study. Wall newspapers, blackboards, and big-character posters in various companies have also closely cooperated with the study of various documents to timely exchange the learning experiences and insights of commanders and fighters.
