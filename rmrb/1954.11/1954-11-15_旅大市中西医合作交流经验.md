Experiences in Cooperation and Exchange Between Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine in Lüda City

In recent years, the traditional Chinese medicine cause in Lüda City has greatly developed and has played a significant role in safeguarding people's health. At present, Lüda City has more than 360 traditional Chinese medicine personnel, 161 traditional Chinese medicine doctors, 21 joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics, and 9 branch clinics of joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics. The joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics have played an active role in organizing traditional Chinese medicine consultations, exchanging medical experiences, and signing medical and health care contracts with factories, mines, and enterprises. Last year alone, 170,000 people sought medical treatment at the joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics and branch clinics in Lüda City.

In order to promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and improve the scientific level of traditional Chinese medicine, the Lüda City Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Experience Exchange Group has recently been established. In addition, medical research and medical units in Lüda City are also actively organizing on-the-job personnel to learn from traditional Chinese medicine. Dalian Railway Hospital, Dalian Municipal Hospital, and Lüda Children's Hospital have all invited traditional Chinese medicine doctors for consultations. Teachers and cadres of Dalian Medical College listened to the resolutions of the National Higher Medical Education Conference regarding the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine and the instructions on traditional Chinese medicine, and universally launched discussions. Now, the library of the college has purchased 45 types of traditional Chinese medicine books, 940 volumes, from Beijing, Shanghai and other places.

    旅大市中西医合作交流经验
    旅大市中医医疗事业几年来有很大发展，对保障人民的健康起了很大的作用。现在旅大市共有中医工作人员三百六十余人，中医大夫一百六十一人，中医联合诊所二十一处和中医联合诊所分诊所九处。中医联合诊所在组织中医会诊，互相交流医疗经验，和厂矿企业部门订立医疗保健合同等方面起了积极作用。去年仅在旅大市各中医联合诊所和分诊所求诊的就有十七万人。
    为了发扬祖国医学遗产，提高中医中药科学水平，旅大市中西医经验交流小组已在最近成立。此外，旅大市各医学研究和医疗单位，也积极组织在职人员向中医学习。大连铁路医院、大连市立医院和旅大市儿童医院都邀请中医进行会诊。大连医学院的教师和干部，听了传达全国高等医学教育会议的决议有关对待中医问题的部分和中医中药问题的指示，并普遍展开讨论。现在该院图书馆已从北京、上海等地购到中医中药书籍四十五种，九百四十册。
