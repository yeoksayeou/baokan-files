    Dulles Says in a Secret Senate Meeting that the U.S.-Chiang Aggression Treaty Will Be Reached by the End of the Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] New York Dispatch: The United States, disregarding the opposition of just world opinion and attempting to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, has been revealed by American columnist Allen. It is said that when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reported on the negotiations with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to sign a "Joint Defense Treaty" at a secret meeting of the Senate Far East Affairs Subcommittee on the 10th, he claimed that the negotiations between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique would reach a complete agreement before the end of this year. Dulles also stated that this treaty being planned between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek is roughly in accordance with the military alliances signed between the United States and South Korea, the Philippines, and Japan. This treaty will stipulate that the United States guarantees to assist the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and support the Chiang Kai-shek clique in carrying out wars of aggression against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas.

    杜勒斯在参院一个秘密会议上说
    美蒋侵略条约将在年底达成
    【新华社十六日讯】纽约消息：美国不顾世界正义舆论的反对、力图阻挠中国人民解放台湾的阴谋，已由美国专栏作家艾伦透露出来。据说，美国国务卿杜勒斯十日在参院远东事务小组委员会秘密会议上报告和蒋介石卖国集团谈判签订“共同防御条约”的情况时声称，美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的这项谈判，将会在今年年底以前达成完全的协议。杜勒斯还表示，美蒋之间正在策划的这个条约，大体上按照美国同南朝鲜、菲律宾和日本之间签订的军事同盟。这个条约将规定美国保证协助蒋介石卖国集团阻挠中国人民解放台湾和澎湖列岛，并支持蒋介石集团进行侵犯中国大陆和沿海地区的战争。
