Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (An'gang) many production plants and mines are further launching a labor emulation drive to strive for increased production of large quantities of iron and steel on the basis of fulfilling this year's national plan. The steelmaking plant plans to increase production by 40,000 tons of steel ingots, and the large rolling mill plans to increase production by 10,000 tons of heavy steel rails. On November 10, the cast pipe plant workers completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule. They will further increase production for the country by 8,600 tons of 300-900 mm diameter cast iron pipes, and save 4.5 billion yuan. The Dalizi Iron Mine also completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule on November 8, and proposed a plan to produce 14,000 tons more ore and save 350 million yuan by the end of the year. The morale of the workers in these factories and mines is extremely high. Li Shaokui, Anshan Iron and Steel Plant No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace steelmaking worker, and Anshan City Special Class Labor Model, said at the mobilization meeting of all plant workers: "We have the confidence to complete this glorious task assigned to us by the state. We must do a good job of unity among the three shifts and strive to win a great victory in this competition!" After the meeting, various work sections, teams, furnaces, and offices formulated specific guarantee conditions. At the same time, the workers of each furnace further implemented the Soviet advanced furnace smelting methods, shortened the smelting time and launched a rapid steelmaking movement. From the 1st to the 16th of this month, there were 59 furnaces of rapid steelmaking. (Our correspondent from the Liaoning station)

    鞍钢许多厂矿进一步开展劳动竞赛
    争取增产大量的钢铁和钢材
    鞍钢许多生产厂矿正进一步开展劳动竞赛，争取在完成今年国家计划的基础上，再为国家增产大量的钢铁和钢材。炼钢厂计划增产四万吨钢锭，大型轧钢厂计划增产一万吨重钢轨。铸管厂职工于十一月十日提前完成了全年国家计划，他们要再给国家增产八千六百吨三百至九百公厘大口径铸铁管，并节约四十五亿元。大栗子铁矿也于十一月八日提前完成了全年国家计划，又提出到年底多生产一万四千吨矿石，节约三亿五千万元的计划。这些厂矿的职工情绪极为高涨。鞍钢炼钢厂八号平炉炼钢工、鞍山市特等劳动模范李绍奎，在全厂职工动员会上说：“我们有信心完成国家交给我们的这一光荣任务，一定要作好三班团结，争取在这次竞赛中打一次大胜仗！”会后，各工段班组、各炉及科室都纷纷制订具体保证条件。同时各炉职工并进一步贯彻了苏联的先进炼炉，缩短熔炼时间和开展快速炼钢运动，从本月一日到十六日出现了五十九炉快速炼钢。（本报辽宁记者站）
