Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: According to TASS, southern Italy's Salerno Province experienced flooding in late October. The floods swept many homes in residential areas, along with their inhabitants, into the sea, and some neighborhoods were completely destroyed.

According to the Italian newspaper "Unità": 318 people died in the flood, and 7,230 people were left homeless. According to official government statistics, the losses caused by the flood exceeded 11 million lire.

Due to damaged transportation, some disaster areas were cut off from the outside world. The victims urgently needed food and medicine. However, according to "Avanti!", there was only one hospital in the entire province of Salerno.

The Soviet government is concerned about the natural disaster suffered by the residents of Salerno Province. The Soviet Ambassador to Italy, A.E. Bogomolov, sent a letter to Italian Foreign Minister Martino on the 5th, expressing the Soviet government's deep sympathy to the victims. He also informed Minister Martino that the Executive Committee of the Union of Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies would donate 25,000 rubles to the Italian Red Cross to help the victims.

The World Federation of Trade Unions also decided at the end of October to send 5 million lire to the Italian General Confederation of Labour to help the disaster-stricken residents there.

    苏联人民和世界工联关怀意大利受灾居民
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社讯：意大利南部萨勒诺省十月下旬发生水灾。洪水把居民区的许多住宅连同居民一齐冲进海里，有些街区整个都被洪水冲毁。
    据意大利“团结报”报道：有三百十八个人在这次水灾中死亡，七千二百三十个人无家可归。据政府正式统计，这次水灾造成的损失超过一千一百万里拉。
    由于交通遭受破坏，有些灾区和外界隔绝。灾民迫切地需要粮食和药品。但是，据“前进报”报道，在萨勒诺全省只有一所医院。
    苏联政府关心萨勒诺省居民所遭受的自然灾害。苏联驻意大利大使亚·叶·波戈莫洛夫五日致函意大利外交部长马蒂诺，代表苏联政府对灾民表示深切同情；他同时通知马蒂诺部长：苏联红十字会和红新月会联合会执行委员会给予意大利红十字会二万五千卢布作为援助受害者之用。
    世界工会联合会也曾在十月底决定寄给意大利总工会五百万里拉，以帮助那里受灾的居民。
