Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 9th: Over the past five years, Soviet experts have made over 30,000 major suggestions to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, resolving many key problems. Taking the 111 major suggestions made at the beginning of this year regarding equipment maintenance, strengthening transportation, reducing costs, improving quality, and ensuring safe production as an example, the suggestion to fundamentally改造 (gaizao, transform or remodel) the continuous rolling mill in the primary rolling mill will greatly increase the mill's capacity. The primary rolling mill has only completed the first step of the overall改造 (gaizao, transform or remodel) plan, but steel billet production has already increased by more than 10% compared to last year. The steelmaking plant's successful study of advanced Soviet steelmaking methods has gradually reduced the rate of defective furnaces. In the last month and a half alone, increasing steel production by 30 tons due to reduced furnace failure rates. Major repairs to blast furnaces used to take at least half a year during the puppet Manchukuo period. Last year, by learning the Soviet rapid repair method, the overhaul of Blast Furnace No. 2 was completed in only 34 days, creating trillions of yuan in wealth for the country. Thanks to the outstanding assistance of Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel's production capacity has increased several times compared to the puppet Manchukuo period, and hundreds of new products have also been successfully trial-produced.

    In basic construction, Soviet experts have not only guaranteed the completion of modern large-scale factories such as the Large Rolling Mill and the Second Thin Plate Mill with their superb technology, but have also put forward more than 10,000 suggestions. After implementing many winter construction technical measures proposed by Soviet experts, such as the concrete electric heating method, steam heating method, and heat storage method, the construction speed of Anshan Iron and Steel has accelerated, and large-scale winter construction can also be carried out comprehensively this year. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the level of mechanized and industrialized construction in several major aspects of construction, such as earthwork, concrete, transportation, and metal structures, has reached more than 50% to 95% respectively, which can accelerate the project progress by an average of 30%. Because of the application of Soviet "transferring beams and replacing columns" and "transferring columns and replacing foundations" technologies, the construction periods of the Large Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Pipe Mill, and the Dagushan Mineral Processing Project currently under construction have been shortened and project costs have been reduced.

    Over the past two years, Soviet experts have also made over 8,000 suggestions for the design of various projects. The second and third automated blast furnaces that have already been改造 (gaizao, transformed or remodeled) successfully, as well as other automated blast furnaces that are currently under construction and design, can each produce thousands of tons more pig iron per year because the furnace hearth diameter has been expanded based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. Thickening the refractory brick layer at the bottom of the furnace and changing the furnace hearth cooling wall to a brick-embedded type have also greatly extended the life of the blast furnace.

    苏联专家对鞍钢作出卓越的贡献
    五年来提出三万多件重大建议
    【新华社鞍山九日电】苏联专家五年来共向鞍山钢铁公司提出三万多件重大建议，解决了许多关键问题。单以今年年初提出的有关设备维护、加强运输、降低成本、提高质量、安全生产等方面的一百一十一项重大建议来说，其中，对初轧厂连轧机进行根本性改造的建议就将大大提高初轧机的能力。现在初轧厂只完成整个改造计划的第一步，钢坯产量已比去年提高百分之十以上。炼钢厂学习苏联先进炼炉法成功，使炼炉率逐渐降低，只最近一个半月，就因降低炼炉率增产了三十吨钢。大修高炉，在伪满时至少需要半年时间；去年因学习苏联快速检修法，二号高炉的大修只三十四天就完成了，为国家多创造了千百亿元的财富。由于苏联专家卓越的帮助，鞍钢的生产能力已比伪满时期成倍地增加，几百种的新产品也试制成功了。
    在基本建设施工中，苏联专家不仅以精湛的技术保证了大型轧钢厂、第二薄板厂等现代化巨大工厂的建成，并先后提出了一万多件建议。实行苏联专家提出的混凝土电气加热法、蒸气加热法、蓄热法等许多冬季施工的技术措施以后，鞍钢的建设速度加快了，今年也能够全面地大规模地进行冬季施工了。在苏联专家指导下，施工中土方、混凝土、运输和金属结构等几个主要方面的机械化工厂化施工水平已分别达到百分之五十到九十五以上，平均可加快工程进度百分之三十。因为运用了苏联“托梁换柱”“托柱换基”的技术，大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和今年施工的大孤山选矿工程都缩短了工期，降低了工程费用。
    苏联专家在过去两年多的时间内并对各个工程的设计提出了八千多件建议。已经改建成功的第二座、第三座自动化高炉和正在建设、设计的其他几座自动化高炉，因为根据苏联专家建议扩大了炉缸直径，每个高炉每年就可以多生产几千吨的生铁。把炉底耐火砖层加厚，炉缸冷却壁改成镶砖式，也使高炉寿命大大延长。
