Xinhua News Agency report: The People's Republic of Poland is constantly strengthening and expanding its trade with countries around the world. Poland now maintains trade relations with more than seventy countries. Poland's foreign trade turnover has increased to more than twice its pre-war level.

Poland has very close economic ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the democratic camp. At present, the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries account for more than 70 percent of Poland's foreign trade, with the Soviet Union accounting for 33.5 percent. The Soviet Union supplies the People's Poland with complete sets of equipment and machinery. Poland's Lenin Metallurgical Combine, the Warsaw and Lublin automobile factories, the "Jaworzno-2" power station, and many other enterprises are equipped with Soviet equipment and machinery.

The People's Poland is also constantly expanding its trade with capitalist countries. Recently, the commodity turnover between Poland and Britain, Denmark, Near Eastern countries, Latin American countries, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia has increased.

Since the establishment of the people's democratic government, the composition of Poland's exports has undergone fundamental changes. Before liberation, the export of raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 72 percent of all exports, agricultural products accounted for 22 percent, and industrial products accounted for only 6 percent. At present, machines and equipment account for a large proportion of Poland's exports. Poland exports merchant ships, railway vehicles, machine tools, new agricultural machinery, textiles, and other industrial products every year.

Xinhua News Agency report: Bulgaria's foreign trade is expanding rapidly. This year, Bulgaria's total foreign trade volume has increased to approximately twice that of pre-war 1939. In foreign trade, Bulgaria's trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries accounts for a large proportion. Every year, Bulgaria imports a large amount of machinery and equipment, petroleum products, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and cotton from the Soviet Union; and ships a large amount of tobacco, minerals, light industrial and canned goods, wine, and volatile oils to the Soviet Union. From 1950 to the end of 1953, the goods shipped from the German Democratic Republic to Bulgaria increased about seven times, while the goods shipped from Bulgaria to the German Democratic Republic increased three times. The commodity exchange between Bulgaria and the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Albania is also constantly increasing.

Bulgaria's trade relations with capitalist countries have also developed greatly. It now trades with thirty capitalist countries and has signed trade agreements with many of them. Since 1951, Bulgaria's commodity exchange with capitalist countries has doubled.

Xinhua News Agency report: State-owned farms play a significant role in the agricultural production of the People's Republic of Poland. Currently, there are more than 700 state-owned farms in Poland, with more than 2.6 million hectares of cultivated land. At present, the agricultural products of state-owned farms account for approximately 15 percent of the total agricultural products in the country.

In recent years, the degree of mechanization of state-owned farm work has greatly increased. The mechanization level of basic agricultural work on state-owned farms has reached more than 70 percent. At the end of last year, state-owned farms had approximately 29,000 tractors, more than twice as many as in 1949.

Compared with 1948, the average unit area yield of major grains on state-owned farms has increased by an average of 70 to 80 percent. Animal husbandry is also developing victoriously. Compared with 1948, the number of cattle on state-owned farms has increased more than threefold, including a threefold increase in the number of dairy cows. The number of pigs has increased about fourfold, and the number of sheep has increased threefold.

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Brief news from Eastern European People's Democratic countries: The first turbine of the Zeran thermoelectric power plant in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, has been installed and has begun testing. Soon, factories, public buildings, and residences in Warsaw and the surrounding areas will be able to obtain electricity and heat from this thermoelectric power plant. This thermoelectric power plant will be one of the largest and most modern thermoelectric power plants in Europe. When fully completed, it can supply electricity for lighting in five cities with a population of one million people, and supply hot water to 90,000 residences, approximately 3.3 million cubic meters of public buildings, and approximately 6 million cubic meters of factory buildings. The design of this thermoelectric power plant, as well as most of the machinery and equipment, are provided by the Soviet Union.

The production volume of Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing industry has more than tripled in the past five years. During the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), 65 types of metal-cutting machine tools and 88 types of textile machinery were manufactured. In order to equip agriculture with modern machinery in the shortest possible time, Czechoslovakia has manufactured new types of tractors and potato diggers this year, and has produced flax combines and automatic threshing machines.

Bulgaria's first and largest printing complex has recently been completed in Sofia. Its printing house has a large production capacity and can print eleven kinds of newspapers and thirty-two kinds of magazines. Its architectural design was jointly drafted by Soviet and Bulgarian experts, and the machinery was transported from the Soviet Union. The complex has five floors, with more than five hundred rooms and workers' residences. The courtyard of the complex is built as beautiful as a garden.

Hungary is now able to produce more complex agricultural machines that could not be manufactured in the past, such as crawler tractors and grain combines. In the first half of this year, Hungarian rural areas received 10,600 plows, several times more threshing machines, beet cutting machines, and grape planting tools than in previous years. Hungary plans to mass produce thirty new types of agricultural machines in 1955.

    波、保两国对外贸易迅速发展
    捷、匈等国的机器制造业获得很大成就
    据新华社讯：波兰人民共和国不断加强和扩大同世界各国的贸易。现在，波兰同七十多个国家保持有贸易联系。波兰的对外贸易流转额已增加为战前水平的两倍以上。
    波兰同苏联、中华人民共和国和民主阵营其他国家之间的经济联系十分紧密。现在，在波兰的对外贸易中，苏联和各人民民主国家所占的比重在百分之七十以上，其中苏联就占百分之三十三点五。苏联供给人民波兰以整套的设备和机器。波兰的列宁冶金联合企业、华沙和卢布林的汽车工厂、“雅沃日诺—二号”电力站以及其他许多企业，都是用苏联的设备和机器装备起来的。
    人民波兰还在不断地扩大同资本主义国家之间的贸易。最近波兰和英国、丹麦、近东各国、拉丁美洲各国、印度、巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚之间的商品流转额已经增加了。
    自从人民民主政权建立以来，波兰出口货的构成已起了根本的变化。解放以前，原料和半制成品的输出占全部出口货的百分之七十二，农产品占百分之二十二，工业品只占百分之六。目前在波兰的出口货中，机器和设备已占很大比重。波兰每年都出口航海商船、铁路车辆、机床、新式农业机器、纺织品和其他工业品。
    据新华社讯：保加利亚的对外贸易正在迅速扩大。今年保加利亚的对外贸易总量已约增为战前一九三九年的二倍。在对外贸易中，保加利亚同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易占有很大的比重。每年，保加利亚从苏联输入大量的机器和设备、石油产品、黑色和有色金属、棉花；并运往苏联大量的烟叶、矿石、轻工业和罐头工业制品、酒和挥发油等。从一九五○年到一九五三年年底，德意志民主共和国运入保加利亚的货物已增加为七倍左右，而保加利亚运到德意志民主共和国的货物增加为三倍。保加利亚同中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚之间的商品交换也在不断增加中。
    保加利亚同资本主义国家的贸易关系也有很大发展。现在它已同三十个资本主义国家进行贸易，并和其中许多国家签订有贸易协定。从一九五一年到现在，保加利亚同资本主义国家的商品交换量已增加一倍。
    据新华社讯：国营农场在波兰人民共和国的农业生产中起着重大的作用。目前，波兰共有七百多个国营农场，这些国营农场拥有二百六十多万公顷耕地。现在，国营农场的农产品，约占全国全部农产品的百分之十五。
    最近几年来，国营农场工作的机械化程度大大提高了。国营农场的基本农业工作的机械化水平达到了百分之七十以上。在去年年底，国营农场约有两万九千台拖拉机，增为一九四九年的两倍多。
    和一九四八年相比，国营农场的主要谷物的单位面积产量平均提高了百分之七十到百分之八十。畜牧业也在胜利地发展着。拿目前和一九四八年相比，国营农场牛的头数增加为三倍以上，其中乳牛头数增加为三倍。猪的头数约增为四倍，羊的头数增为三倍。
    【新华社十一日讯】东欧人民民主国家简讯：波兰首都华沙的泽兰电热厂的第一座透平已经安装完毕并开始试验了。不久，华沙和附近地区的工厂、公共建筑物和住宅就可得到这个电热厂供应的电力和热力。这个电热厂将是欧洲最大的和最现代化的电热厂之一。它全部建成后可以供应五个有一百万人口的城市的电灯用电，以热水供给九万间住宅、约三百三十万立方公尺的公共建筑物和约六百万立方公尺的厂房。这个电热厂的设计以及大部分机器和设备都是由苏联供给的。
    捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业的生产量在过去五年中增加了两倍以上。在第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）期间开始制造的金属切削机床有六十五种，纺织机器有八十八种。为了在最短的时期内用现代化的机器装备农业，捷克斯洛伐克今年已制造了新型的拖拉机和马铃薯挖掘机，并生产了亚麻联合机和自动打谷机等。
    保加利亚的第一个最大的印刷联合工厂最近已在索非亚建成了。它的印刷所的生产能力很大，可以印十一种报纸和三十二种杂志。它的建筑设计由苏联和保加利亚的专家们共同拟定，机器是由苏联运来的。这个联合工厂有五层楼，里面有五百多个房间和工人的住所。联合工厂的内院建设得像花园一样美丽。
    匈牙利现在已能生产过去不能制造的履带式拖拉机和谷物联合机等较复杂的农业机器。今年上半年匈牙利农村得到了一万零六百部犁，比往年多几倍的脱粒机、甜菜切割机和种植葡萄用的工具。匈牙利计划在一九五五年大批生产三十种新的农业机器。
