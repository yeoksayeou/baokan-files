Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 22nd — The People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units guarding the Xiamen area held celebration meetings to celebrate the glorious victory of shooting down 14 Chiang bandit planes and damaging 48 Chiang bandit planes in the past two months. It also commended and rewarded 175 people's heroes who performed meritorious services in combat and 12 units that performed collective meritorious services.

Among the people's heroes are commanders, gunners, observers, telephone operators, drivers, cooks, and repairmen. The commanders and fighters of the 4th Company of a certain unit, who were awarded the honorary title of Second-Class Collective Merit Company, fiercely and accurately attacked Chiang bandit planes in combat, creating the example of shooting down two Chiang bandit planes and damaging nine Chiang bandit planes with a small amount of ammunition. The commanders and fighters of the motor vehicle platoon of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, who were awarded the honorary title of Third-Class Collective Merit Platoon, made 282 sorties and drove more than 9,000 kilometers in more than 20 days, braving the artillery fire and aircraft attacks of the Chiang bandit army, and outstandingly completed their transportation tasks. Yuan Shutan, the deputy company commander of the Second Company of a certain unit and a third-class meritorious person, persisted in fighting despite his illness. After the company commander was wounded, he calmly and bravely commanded the troops to fiercely attack the Chiang bandit planes, braving the ground artillery fire and aircraft attacks of the Chiang bandit army, and achieved the glorious record of shooting down two Chiang bandit planes and damaging three Chiang bandit planes in one day. Wang Wenjin, a gunner of the Second Company of a certain unit and a second-class meritorious person, protected the safety of the sight in combat despite the artillery fire of the Chiang bandit army. In one fierce battle, he was wounded in the back, but he still continued to quickly rotate the cannon to meet the Chiang bandit plane, regardless of everything. Xu Shanda, a telephone operator of the Seventh Company of a certain unit and a second-class meritorious person, rescued the telephone squad leader who was wounded by a bullet while connecting the line, braving the artillery fire of the Chiang bandit army. Then, braving the bombing and strafing of the Chiang bandit planes, he repeatedly connected the broken telephone lines, ensuring smooth communication during wartime.
