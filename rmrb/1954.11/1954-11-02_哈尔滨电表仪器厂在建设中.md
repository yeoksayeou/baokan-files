The Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory, our country's first modern, automated electric meter and instrument factory, is being built on the south bank of the Songhua River in Northeast China. Construction began on April 21st of this year, and the civil engineering for Factory Buildings No. 1 and No. 3, the boiler room, the garage, the flammable materials warehouse, and more than ten dormitories in the living area has now been completed. According to the planned schedule, this factory will partially commence production next year and will be fully operational by 1956.

Everyone knows that electricity is very useful. However, electricity is a very mysterious thing; you cannot see it with your eyes, nor can you touch it with your hands. Therefore, it is necessary to use instruments and equipment to measure it, control it, and prevent accidents. For example, if a major electricity user of a hydroelectric power station suddenly stops using electricity, or if a short circuit occurs on an external line (the wire is grounded or two wires touch each other), the power generation equipment will be endangered. If the "overvoltage and undervoltage protection relay" manufactured by the factory in the future is used, the threat to the power generation equipment under the above two conditions can be eliminated in a short time. Also, the electricity generated by the power station must be transmitted through wires. If an accident occurs on a power transmission line hundreds of kilometers long somewhere, affecting safe power transmission, many workers have to be dispatched to check the line for a long time in order to repair it. This factory can produce a "distance protection relay." Using it in conjunction with other switching equipment can automatically stop the power supply on the section of the line where the accident occurred. This not only protects the equipment and the line but also indicates which section of the line is broken, so a few workers can repair it. In the many automated and highly mechanized factories to be built in the future, various voltmeters, frequency meters, power meters, and synchronizers will be needed on the switchboards that control the machines. A large number of automobiles, tractors, and ships to be manufactured in the future will also need to be equipped with odometers, ammeters, fuel gauges, oil pressure gauges, and water temperature gauges. With the development of large-scale machine industry, various factories, mines, and scientific research institutions will establish many laboratories, which will require various precision electrical instruments. Although there are some instrument factories in our country that can produce some electric meters and instruments, they are far from meeting the needs of national construction. Therefore, it is necessary to build such a large-scale factory.

The Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory, which is under construction, was designed with the help of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it will be equipped with advanced Soviet technology. The machinery and equipment in the factory are highly mechanized and automated. Among the thousands of pieces of equipment, there is a machine for making small screws. As long as the workers put the thin steel wire into one end, small screws will drop out of the other end one after another. The quality requirements for the products of this factory are very strict. For example, for an electric meter used in a laboratory, the error in measuring the current must not exceed two parts per thousand. Some parts are very small, and workers have to wear magnifying glasses with 250 to 300 times magnification when processing them. When checking the quality, just like doctors examining bacteria in a hospital, it is impossible to do without a microscope. The method of product configuration is also very advanced. Conveyor belts are used to transfer between processes. Taking the assembly of kilowatt-hour meters as an example, each process must be assembled within 30 seconds. After the first process is completed, the conveyor belt automatically transfers the product to the second process... When it comes to the final process, one exquisite and complete finished product is neatly arranged there. Factory Building No. 2 is a multi-story building, and each floor is connected by elevators for production purposes. Products assembled on the third or second floor can be gently placed on the elevator after inspection and testing, and they can be sent to the finished product warehouse in an orderly manner. This factory is not only exquisitely equipped, but also requires certain control over the air and temperature inside the factory because the processed parts are very precise. The temperature in the assembly workshop of Factory Building No. 2 must be maintained at about 20 degrees Celsius all year round, and the difference between high and low cannot exceed three degrees; the air entering this factory must be filtered; there are also dust removal, spraying, and sprinkling equipment here. According to different production technical requirements, the floors of each workshop have seven types, including oilcloth, sawdust bricks, and ceramic tiles. In order to prevent external noise from entering the factory building, sound insulation equipment is also installed here.

The factory also takes into full consideration the workers' welfare, cultural facilities, and living conditions. Each workshop has a living room. In front of the factory area, there is a large garden of more than 20,000 square meters, planted with various flowers, plants, and trees for the employees to rest in their spare time. More than ten three-story dormitories for employees' families, which began construction this year, have been completed one after another not far from the factory area. This is the living area, which will have family residences, single dormitories, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools for children, clubs, canteens, cooperatives, bathhouses, barber shops, laundries, clinics, etc., which will be built one after another soon.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂在建设中
    文源
    在东北松花江南岸，我国第一座现代化、自动化的电表仪器厂——国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂，从今年四月二十一日开工兴建以来，目前已完成了第一号和第三号厂房、锅炉房、汽车库、易燃材料仓库以及生活区的十余幢宿舍的土木建筑工程。按照预定计划，这座工厂将在明年部分投入生产，到一九五六年可以全部投入生产。
    大家都知道电的功用是很大的。但是，电是一种很奇妙的东西，眼睛看不见，手也不能摸，所以必须用仪器设备来测量它，控制它，防止发生事故。比如有一个水力发电站的主要用电户，突然停止用电，或外面线路发生短路（电线接地或两条电线相碰）的时候，都会使得发电设备发生危险。如果使用了该厂将来制造的“过压和欠压保护继电器”，在上述两种情况之下对发电设备所发生的威胁就可在短时间内消除。又如发电站发出来的电，必须通过电线输送出来，假如一条数百公里长的送电线在某处发生了事故，影响安全送电了，想要把它修理好，就得出动很多工人，用很长的时间去查看线路。在这个工厂里能生产一种“距离保护继电器”，使用它结合其他开关设备，能自动地把出事故的一段线路上的电停止供应，这不但保护了设备及线路，并且也指示出来那一段线路坏了，去几个工人就可以把它修好。将来新建的许多自动化和高度机械化的工厂里，在操纵机器的开关板上面，都需要各种电压表、周波表、功率表、整步器。今后要制造的大量汽车、拖拉机和轮船上面，也都要安装里程表、电流表、汽油量表、油压表、水温表。随着大机器工业的发展，各工厂、矿山和科学研究机关要开办许多实验室，实验室里更需要各种精密的电表仪器。目前我国虽有一些仪表厂，也能生产一些电表仪器，但是远不能满足国家建设上的需要，因此就必须新建这样一座规模巨大的工厂。
    正在建设的哈尔滨电表仪器厂，是苏联帮助我国设计的。因此，它将以苏联先进技术装备起来。厂里的机器设备都是高度机械化和自动化的。在数千台设备中，有一台制造小螺丝钉的机器，只要工人们在这头把细钢丝放进去，小小的螺丝钉就会从那头一个接着一个的掉出来。这个工厂产品的质量要求很严格。像制造给实验室用的一种电表，它测量电流有多么大，误差不得超过千分之二。有的部件非常小，加工时工人们要带上二百五十到三百倍的放大镜，在检查质量的时候，正像医院里医生检查细菌一样，离开了显微镜是不行的。在产品配制的方法上，也是非常先进的。工序之间都是用传送带传递着。以装配瓩时计为例，每道工序必须在三十秒钟以内装配完毕，第一道工序装完了之后，传送带就自动地把制品传送给第二道工序……到末道工序时，就有一台一台精美完整的成品排放在那里了。第二号厂房是多层的建筑物，每层楼之间，都是用电梯把生产联系起来的。三层或二层楼内装配起来的产品，经过检查试验后，只要把它轻轻的放在电梯上，就可以井然有序的送进成品仓库。这座工厂不但设备精巧，由于加工的部件非常精密，连厂内的空气、温度也要加以一定的控制。第二号厂房装配车间的气温要常年保持在摄氏二十度左右，高低不能相差三度；空气进入这个厂房要经过过滤；这里还有吸尘、喷雾、洒水等设备。根据生产技术上不同的要求，各车间的地板有油漆布的、锯末砖的、瓷砖的等七种。为了防止外面的复音传入厂房，这里也都装置有隔音设备。
    这座工厂对工人们的生活福利和文化设施也考虑得十分周到。每个车间都有一个生活室。厂区前面有一座两万多平方公尺的大花园，里面种植着各种花草和树木，供职工业余休息。在离厂区不远的地方，今年开始兴建的十多幢三层楼职工家属宿舍已先后竣工。这里是生活区，将有家属住宅、独身宿舍、托儿所、幼儿园、子弟小学校、俱乐部、食堂、合作社、浴池、理发室、洗衣房、诊疗所等，不久即可陆续建筑起来。
