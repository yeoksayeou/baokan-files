Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Employees
Solve Key Problems in Improving Production Through Technological Innovation

Since the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant launched a mass technological innovation campaign, it has solved some key problems in production. From June to late October, the plant has issued eighteen topics, of which two have been completely resolved, six have been basically resolved, and the rest are being researched and resolved. These topics were determined after analysis and research based on the key problems existing in the workshop operation plan. For example, the first batch of plant-level topics raised the issue of how to improve the quality of Ma Tie "pipe joints." After more than two months of efforts by the Du Kunshan team in the Ma Tie Department of the foundry workshop, they came up with four new operation methods, such as improving the riser position of the sand mold and placing chills, so that all 58 types of Ma Tie "pipe joints" were successfully manufactured. Among them, 15 types passed the water pressure test, and the finished product rate reached more than 87%, an increase of more than 37% compared with June of this year, which can increase production and save more than 18 million yuan for the country throughout the year. Another example is that the average timber yield rate of the plant's timber workshop is less than 40% of the raw wood, and it often suffers from bending, deformation, and other problems, resulting in serious waste. After the timber workshop selected the topic, it brought into play the collective strength, created new timber and blanking methods, and formulated operating procedures, which improved the quality of wood drying, and significantly improved the timber yield rate. According to statistics, it can save 783 cubic meters of wood throughout the year, worth 942.2 million yuan. Others, such as the steel casting workshop, successfully used "wood flour sand" instead of soybean oil as part of the core, and tried to reduce the amount of soybean oil used in the cores that must use soybean oil, which can save more than 303 million yuan.

    在技术革新中解决提高生产的关键问题
    青岛四方机车车辆制造工厂开展群众性的技术革新运动以来，解决了一些生产中的关键问题。从六月份到十月下旬，该厂已发布了课题十八个，完全解决的有两个，基本上解决了的有六个，其余正在研究解决中。这些课题都是根据车间作业计划中存在的关键问题，经过分析研究而确定的。如第一批厂级课题提出了如何提高马铁“管接”的质量问题，经翻砂车间马铁部杜昆山小组两个多月的努力，想出了改良砂型冒口位置和放冷铁等四种新的操作方法，使五十八种马铁“管接”全部制造成功，其中十五种经过水压试验，成品率达到了百分之八十七以上，比今年六月份的成品率提高了百分之三十七以上，全年能为国家增产节约一千八百多万元。又如该厂制材车间成材率平均还不到荒木的百分之四十，并时常发生弯曲、变形等毛病，造成严重的浪费现象。制材车间拔取课题后，发挥了集体力量，创造了新的成材、下料方法，并制定了操作规程，提高了木材干燥质量，使成材率获得显著提高，据统计全年可以节约木材七百八十三立方公尺，价值九亿四千二百多万元。其他如铸钢车间试用“木粉砂”代替豆油作一部分砂芯成功，并在必须利用豆油的砂芯中尽量减少豆油用量，可以节约三亿三百多万元。（李鸿起）
