Zhejiang Huangyan Mandarin Oranges Achieve Bumper Harvest

The Huangyan mandarin oranges of Zhejiang, well-known at home and abroad, have achieved another bumper harvest this year. More than 23,000 mu of dense orange groves on both banks of the Chengjiang River in Huangyan are laden with fruit, and groups of orange-picking teams are active everywhere.

In recent years, Huangyan orange farmers have received assistance from Soviet experts on many occasions, vigorously promoting advanced technologies such as reasonable fertilization, pruning, and pest and disease control, which has greatly increased the yield of mandarin oranges. This year, the total output of mandarin oranges is expected to reach more than 54.8 million jin, an increase of about 40% compared with last year. The orange farmers are striving to sell all the oranges that meet export specifications to the state to support the country's industrial construction.

This year, the state's organized exports of mandarin oranges increased by 70.79% compared with last year. If these mandarin oranges were exchanged for steel, they could be exchanged for more than 13,000 tons. Photo by Xu Yonghui (Draft from Zhejiang Daily)

    浙江省黄岩蜜橘丰收
    畅销国内外的浙江黄岩蜜橘，今年又获丰收。黄岩澄江两岸的二万三千多亩茂密的橘园，挂着累累的橘果，到处活跃着成群结伴的采橘小组。
    几年来，黄岩橘农多次获得苏联专家的帮助，大力推广合理施肥、修枝和防治病虫害等先进技术，使蜜橘的产量有了很大的提高。今年蜜橘的总产量可达五千四百八十余万斤，比去年增加了百分之四十左右。橘农们都争取把适合外销规格的橘子全部卖给国家，支援国家的工业建设。
    今年国家组织出口的蜜橘比去年增加百分之七十点七九。如果用这些蜜橘换取钢材，可以换回一万三千多吨。徐永辉摄（浙江日报稿）
