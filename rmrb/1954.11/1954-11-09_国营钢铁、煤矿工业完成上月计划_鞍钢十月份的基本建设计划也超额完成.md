　　State-owned Iron and Steel and Coal Industries Complete Last Month's Plan
　　Anshan Iron and Steel's Basic Construction Plan for October Also Exceeded
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry exceeded its October production plan. The total output value completed in October was 107.2. The completion of the plan for five major products was as follows: iron ore 102.2, metallurgical coke 101.4, pig iron 106.1, steel 105.3, and steel products 105.7. The production volume of these major products increased compared to the same period last year, with the largest increase exceeding 50%.
　　Since entering the fourth quarter, workers and staff of enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau have actively responded to the call of the Party and the government for increasing production and practicing economy, and have further launched a labor competition. Some enterprises have quickly reversed the poor production situation in the third quarter. The production of open-hearth steel has not been good for half a year, becoming a weak link in production, but after taking a series of measures, there has been an improvement in October. The production of blast furnaces in most enterprises was basically stable in October, and the production level was higher than in September.
　　[Report from this newspaper] Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded its October production plan and basic construction plan. The production plan was exceeded by 9.5%, and the total output value increased by 15.2% compared to September. The basic construction plan was exceeded by 6%.
　　October was the best month for Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of completing the state plan in the first ten months of this year. Sixteen major products, except for rich ore, all exceeded the monthly plan, and the quality also improved compared to September. Among them, sintered ore exceeded the state plan by 5.6%, an increase of 13.9% compared to September, and the first-grade product rate also increased from 55.1% in September to 91%. Pig iron exceeded the state plan by 3.8%, an increase of 29.4% compared to September, and the qualification rate of iron quality in October also increased by 18.7% compared to August. Steel ingots exceeded the state plan by 4.8%, an increase of 6.5% compared to September, and the quality of steel ingots increased by 0.8% compared to September. Steel billets exceeded the state plan by 6%, an increase of 7.2% compared to September, and the quality also met the standards.
　　October was also the best month for Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of completing basic construction tasks in the first ten months of this year. In October, the engineering companies of Anshan Iron and Steel strengthened the implementation of the technical responsibility system, did a good job in technical preparation, and promoted the comprehensive operation plan of construction site directors, launching a labor competition. As a result, work efficiency generally improved. At the same time, the strengthening of cooperation between basic construction and production units also created conditions for exceeding the task. By October, the cumulative progress of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction had reached 81% of the annual plan.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch] National state-owned coal mines exceeded the national coal production plan for October by 2.5%, with mines in the Northeast region exceeding the most, reaching 4.1%. The excess coal produced, if used for power generation, could generate more than 170 million kilowatt-hours.
　　Safety work in coal mines improved to some extent in October. Many units eliminated fatal accidents, and the number of deaths decreased by 65% compared to the same period last year. The key learning of the pilot experience of Ping'an No. 1 Mine, No. 1 Coal Seam in Fuxin, has also achieved results. For example, the No. 4 coal mining section of Ping'an No. 1 Mine, due to conscientious study, focusing on achieving a cycle of one day and one night, strengthened political work and management work, and completed the state plan for October eleven days ahead of schedule. At the same time, the consumption of pit wood, gunpowder, and detonators all decreased universally compared to September.

### 国营钢铁、煤矿工业完成上月计划  鞍钢十月份的基本建设计划也超额完成

    国营钢铁、煤矿工业完成上月计划
    鞍钢十月份的基本建设计划也超额完成
    【本报讯】重工业部钢铁工业管理局超额完成了十月份生产计划。十月份完成总产值一○七·二，五种主要产品完成计划的情况是：铁矿石一○二·二，冶金焦一○一·四，生铁一○六·一，钢一○五·三，钢材一○五·七。这些主要产品的生产量比去年同期都有了提高，最多的提高了百分之五十以上。
    进入第四季度以来，钢铁工业管理局所属企业职工积极响应党和政府关于增产节约的号召，进一步展开了劳动竞赛，一部分企业迅速扭转了第三季度生产情况不好的局面。半年来平炉钢的生产情况都不够好，成为生产中薄弱的一环，但采取一系列的措施后，十月份已有了好转。大多数企业十月份高炉的生产基本上是稳定的，生产水平较九月份提高。
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司十月份生产计划和基本建设计划超额完成。生产计划超额百分之九点五，生产总值比九月份提高了百分之十五点二。基本建设计划超额百分之六。
    十月份是鞍钢今年十个月来完成国家计划情况较好的一个月。十六种主要产品除富矿石外都超额完成了月计划，质量也比九月份提高。其中烧结矿石超过国家计划百分之五点六，比九月份提高百分之十三点九，一级品率也由九月份百分之五十五点一，提高到百分之九十一。生铁超过国家计划百分之三点八，比九月份提高百分之二十九点四，铁的质量，十月份的合格率也比八月份提高百分之十八点七。钢锭超过国家计划百分之四点八，比九月份提高百分之六点五，钢锭质量比九月份提高百分之零点八。钢坯超过国家计划百分之六，比九月份提高百分之七点二，质量也都达到了标准。
    十月份也是鞍钢今年十个月来完成基本建设任务较好的一个月。在十月里，鞍钢各工程公司加强了技术责任制度的实施，做好了技术准备工作，并推行了工地主任综合作业计划，开展了劳动竞赛，因而工作效率普遍提高；同时，由于基本建设和生产单位加强了协作配合，也为超额完成任务创造了条件。到十月止，鞍钢基本建设累计进度已达到全年计划的百分之八十一。
    【新华社八日讯】全国国营煤矿超额百分之二点五完成了十月份的国家产煤计划，其中东北地区各矿超额最多，达百分之四点一。超额生产的煤如果用来发电，约可发出一亿七千万度以上。
    十月份煤矿的安全工作有一定改进，不少单位消灭了死亡事故，死亡人数比去年同期减少百分之六十五。各矿重点学习阜新平安一坑一公尺层试点经验也有了成绩。如平安一坑第四采煤段由于认真学习，以搞好一昼夜一个循环为中心，加强了政治工作和管理工作，提前十一天完成了十月份的国家计划，同时，坑木、火药、雷管的消耗，也都比九月份普遍降低。
