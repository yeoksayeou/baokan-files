    National First Staff and Workers Sports Work Conference Opens
    The National First Staff and Workers Sports Work Conference, jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, opened in Beijing on the 5th.
    The tasks of this conference are: to examine and summarize the staff and workers sports work across the country in recent years, unify thinking, exchange experiences, further strengthen the leadership of staff and workers' sports activities, improve the physical health of staff and workers, and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national construction plan.
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Education Trade Union, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways and President of the China Railway Sports Association, Jiang Guangnai, Minister of Textile Industry, Mao Qihua, Deputy Minister of Labor, Cui Yitian, Deputy Minister of Health, Li Yu, Deputy Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Wang Lin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, Zhang Ze, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and others attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches.
    Lai Ruoyu said in his opening speech: In recent years, under the care of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, staff and workers' sports activities have greatly developed, playing a positive role in enhancing the health of staff and workers and improving labor productivity. He pointed out: Because carrying out staff and workers' sports activities is a new undertaking, both the leadership and the staff and workers still lack sufficient understanding of the great significance of carrying out sports activities. Some people are afraid that engaging in sports activities will hinder production, and some people believe that productive labor can replace sports activities. Lai Ruoyu emphasized: Sports activities are an active method to enhance the physical fitness of staff and workers, are an integral part of communist education, and are an indispensable task of the trade union. He believes that in the future, concrete leadership over staff and workers' sports activities should be strengthened, organizations for managing sports work should be established in trade unions at all levels, groups leading staff and workers' sports should be gradually established on a trial basis in factories and mines and industrial systems where conditions permit, cadres and activists should be vigorously trained, the role of activists should be fully utilized, the understanding of sports activities among all staff and workers should be improved, and more staff and workers should be absorbed to participate in sports activities.
    Liu Ziku, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report, in which he summarized the staff and workers' sports work in recent years and put forward opinions on future work.
    More than 200 people attended and were present at the conference, including the heads of the seven industrial trade unions directly under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the China Railway Sports Association, and the relevant provincial and municipal trade unions, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and the Youth League.

    全国第一次职工体育工作会议开幕
    中华全国总工会和体育运动委员会联合召开的全国第一次职工体育工作会议，五日在北京开幕。
    这次会议的任务是：检查和总结几年来全国职工体育工作，统一思想，交流经验，进一步加强职工体育运动的领导，增进职工身体健康，保证国家建设计划的完成和超额完成。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章、铁道部部长、中国火车头体育协会会长滕代远、纺织工业部部长蒋光鼐、劳动部副部长毛齐华、卫生部副部长崔义田、第一机械工业部副部长黎玉、燃料工业部副部长王林、中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记章泽等都出席了开幕式，并讲了话。
    赖若愚在致开幕词时说：几年来，职工体育运动在毛主席、共产党和人民政府的关怀下，有了很大的发展，对增强职工健康，提高劳动生产率，起了良好的作用。他指出：由于开展职工体育运动是个新的工作，不论领导上或职工群众对开展体育运动的重大意义还有认识不够的地方。有些人怕搞体育运动妨碍生产，有的人认为生产劳动就可以代替体育运动。赖若愚强调指出：体育运动是增强职工体质的积极方法，是共产主义教育的组成部分，是工会不可缺少的工作。他认为今后应加强对职工体育运动的具体领导，在各级工会建立管理体育工作的机构，在有条件的厂矿和产业系统逐步试建领导职工体育的团体，大力培养干部和积极分子，充分发挥积极分子的作用，提高全体职工对体育运动的认识，吸收更广大的职工参加体育运动。
    中华全国总工会书记处书记刘子久做了报告，他总结了几年来的职工体育工作，并提出今后工作的意见。
    出席和列席这次会议的有中华全国总工会直属的七个产业工会、中国火车头体育协会和有关省市工会、体育运动委员会、青年团的负责人共二百多人。  （新华社）
