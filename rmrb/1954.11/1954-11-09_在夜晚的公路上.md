    On the Road at Night
    Shao Yanxiang
    Night descends from the foot of the mountain,
    The whirlwind howls even more fiercely.
    At this moment, songs rise on the highway,
    Three trucks speed along.
    Headlights flicker on and off,
    Across the flat sands, small and large villages flash by.
    Who is disturbing the peace of the night?
    A group of people who never know peace.
    ——Our ages are eighteen, nineteen,
    At most, just a little over twenty;
    A surging sound sings in everyone's heart.
    We have many, many peers,
    Brothers, sisters, closest friends,
    Who have confided in each other with grand dreams,
    While exchanging precious promises.
    Some of them went to the mines,
    Some went to remote villages,
    And some joined the army, navy, and air force,
    Becoming tank soldiers, charging into battle.
    And we are determined to travel thousands of mountains and rivers,
    To awaken the power sleeping in the heart of the earth;
    Even if we toil in the wilderness,
    Even if we travel countless roads;
    East today, west tomorrow,
    Leaving footprints on virgin land;
    Who wouldn't want to see on the ground they've personally touched,
    Chimneys and iron towers standing tall!
    For this, from this place to that place,
    We are like soldiers changing guard.
    Ask the friends in the distance, where are you tonight——
    On duty, or on the road?…

    在夜晚的公路上
    邵燕祥
    夜色从山脚袭来，
    旋风呼啸得更凶。
    这时候公路上扬起了歌声，
    三辆卡车在飞奔。
    车灯灭了又亮了，
    平沙上闪过大小乡村。
    是谁扰乱了夜晚的平静？
    好一群永远不知道平静的人。
    ——我们的年纪十八、十九，
    顶多不过二十挂零；
    有一个汹涌澎湃的声音歌唱在每个人的胸口。
    我们有许多许多的同年，
    兄弟，姐妹，顶亲密的朋友，
    互相倾诉过伟大的梦想，
    在交换宝贵的约言的时候。
    他们有的去到矿井，
    有的走向边远的乡村，
    还有的参加了陆、空、海军，
    当上了坦克兵，冲锋陷阵。
    而我们决心走万水千山，
    去唤醒沉睡在地心的力量；
    哪怕在荒山老林里奔波，
    哪怕在无数条路上来往；
    今天往东，明天往西，
    处女地上留下脚迹；
    谁不愿在亲手抚摸过的地面，
    看烟囱和铁塔高高矗起！
    为了这，从这地方到那地方，
    我们好像士兵在换防。
    问远方的朋友啊今夜在哪里——
    在岗位上，还是在路上？……
