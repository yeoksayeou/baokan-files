    Correctly Implement the Grain Unified Purchase Policy
    Liu Chun
    The experience of implementing the grain unified purchase policy for the past year has proven that, in addition to doing a good job in political and economic work under the direct leadership of the Party, it is also necessary to formulate simple and easy-to-implement grain unified purchase methods in accordance with the state's grain unified purchase policies and regulations, adapting them to local conditions. This is entirely necessary to correctly implement the grain unified purchase policy, simplify procedures, save time, ensure the completion of the grain unified purchase task, and promote the gradual institutionalization of grain unified purchase work.
    In last year's grain unified purchase work, the general approach adopted by various localities was to "investigate farmers' surplus grain, issue task control figures level by level from top to bottom, mobilize farmers to report voluntarily, and combine this with democratic appraisal." This was practical in the initial implementation of grain unified purchase, when the extremely complex situation of grain production, consumption, surplus, and shortage in rural areas was still unclear, and cadres lacked experience. This approach was conducive to educating farmers and completing tasks in a pragmatic manner, adapting to local conditions. In the circumstances of last year, this method had more advantages than disadvantages, and was therefore necessary and correct. However, due to the lack of a specific method to serve as a concrete basis for cadres and farmers to implement the state's grain unified purchase policy, some areas saw politically conscious farmers taking the lead in selling more surplus grain, even selling some of their rations, while more backward people did not sell enough. There was also no specific constraint on rich peasants, resulting in disproportionate burdens. At the same time, the comprehensive appraisal was extensive and cumbersome, slowing down the work and affecting other rural work and agricultural production to some extent. During this year's summer wheat unified purchase, various localities formulated some simpler unified purchase methods based on past experience. Judging from the results of implementation, cadres felt more confident with a specific method, fewer deviations occurred, and farmers felt they understood the bottom line of the policy, dispelling their concerns and encouraging them to sell grain enthusiastically.
    Although the methods formulated by various localities differ in form, they generally grasped the four basic links of verifying output, verifying expenditure standards, stipulating unified purchase rates, and combining with democratic appraisal, which is very necessary.
    Verifying grain output is an important key to correctly implementing the grain unified purchase standard and rationally allocating grain unified purchase tasks. This is a complex task that directly affects the immediate interests of the vast number of farmers and requires appropriate ideological work and necessary organizational work. Based on the experience of assessing output in last year's autumn and this year's summer grain unified purchase: first, it is necessary to educate village cadres to truly understand the grain unified purchase policy, and form appraisal groups or appraisal committees composed of township cadres to assess output conscientiously and realistically. Output determination should be based on actual output, but the method should be as simple and easy to implement as possible. Materials related to the normal agricultural tax output and the output from last year's unified purchase must be fully utilized. In areas where the actual output is largely consistent with the normal output, calculations can be based on the normal output; in areas where the actual output is higher than the normal output, but the difference between the two is roughly the same, it is advisable to calculate by adding a percentage to the normal output; in areas where the actual output and the normal output differ significantly and the difference between the two is irregular, it is necessary to estimate output by dividing the area into zones, but the number of zones should not be too many, the grading should not be too detailed, and especially not calculated household by household. After the method is drafted, it must be submitted to the masses for discussion, approved by the township people's congress, and approved by the people's committee at the next higher level. In this year's summer unified purchase, the authenticity of the output assessment reached about 90% in areas that did this, the masses were satisfied, and the work progressed smoothly; otherwise, it caused dissatisfaction among farmers and the work fell into passivity.
    In order to promote agricultural production and the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and to ensure the completion of the national grain unified purchase task, it is necessary to appropriately stipulate the standards for farmers' rations, seeds, and feed expenditures in accordance with the principle of "unified purchase of surplus grain, not purchasing rations." Since living habits and economic conditions vary from place to place, a uniform standard cannot be rigidly stipulated within a province when stipulating the above standards, but only a controlling general standard can be stipulated. A region or county within a province must, in the spirit of ensuring that farmers have enough to eat and use, combine specific circumstances and refer to the general standards stipulated by the province to make specific provisions in accordance with local conditions. The experience of various localities in calculating the various expenditure standards is: for eating grain, the average per capita consumption of local middle peasants is used to stipulate the average consumption per person, and calculated according to the number of people in each household. For the floating population, rations are left or removed according to their time at home; seed grain is determined according to the number of acres planted and the type of grain, with reference to local farmers' seed retention habits; livestock feed is based on the general feed of local mules, horses, cattle, donkeys, pigs, etc., to determine an average standard, and estimated according to the number of large and small livestock in each household. The calculation time for grain expenditure should be based on the grain harvest season in various places, and calculated on a full-year basis. Because the various expenditure standards are not easy to calculate accurately at present, they must be grasped in the spirit of seeking truth from facts.
    In order to correctly implement the principle of "unified purchase of surplus grain, not purchasing rations," it is also necessary to rationally stipulate the unified purchase rate. The unified purchase rate must both encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, ensure the completion of the grain unified purchase task, and reflect the Party's class line in rural areas. The basic experience of various localities in stipulating the unified purchase rate is: in areas where the difference in per capita land and output is very large, a progressive system must be adopted, that is, according to the different amounts of surplus grain, surplus grain households are divided into several grades, and the unified purchase rate is changed according to the grade. The more surplus grain, the more the unified purchase quantity. In areas where the per capita land and output are roughly the same, a proportional system can be adopted, that is, only one unified purchase rate is stipulated, and surplus grain is purchased proportionally. In grain unified purchase work, when the situation of farmers' grain production, consumption, surplus, and shortage cannot be accurately grasped, in order to avoid affecting farmers' production mood and prevent possible deviations in unified purchase work, it is also necessary to leave a small amount of surplus grain for farmers to dispose of freely or allow them to adjust to the national grain market, which is very necessary for both the state and the farmers. However, the surplus grain left for rich peasants to dispose of freely should not exceed the level of grain retention of local general middle peasants. All unified purchase rates must both ensure the completion of the unified purchase task and prevent deviations such as purchasing too little from those with more surplus and purchasing too much from those with less surplus, squeezing rations. In some areas, the starting point for purchase is too low, or the progressive rate difference is large, and the progressive rate stipulated for farmers with more surplus grain is small, resulting in an unbalanced distribution of tasks and the occurrence of disproportionate burdens, which must be studied and corrected when stipulating the unified purchase rate in the future.
    Unified purchase of farmers' surplus grain is a very complex and meticulous task, and relying solely on the above standards cannot completely solve the problem of rationally allocating grain unified purchase tasks. In order to make up for the shortcomings of the above standards, it is also necessary to supplement it with democratic appraisal. According to past experience, a two-way appraisal method should generally be adopted, that is, after the unified purchase task is calculated and assigned according to the unified purchase method, farmers who have real difficulties can be appraised for reduction or exemption, and those with still a lot of surplus grain can also be appraised for selling more. In this way, for those with less surplus grain, rations will not be squeezed, and for those with more surplus grain, the purpose of purchasing more can also be achieved. The scope of appraisal should be reduced as much as possible. The appraisal committee, composed of Party and League members, activists, and township cadres, is responsible for organizing the masses to carry out the appraisal, striving to achieve basic fairness and rationality.
    Now the autumn grain unified purchase work has begun in various places. We must fully recognize that the grain unified purchase methods that have been stipulated in various places are still crude and incomplete. We must pay attention to constantly accumulating experience in our work and correcting it. We must also see that, with the rapid development of China's agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the source of commercial grain obtained by the state will gradually increase in state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, it is also necessary to gradually formulate practical and feasible grain unified purchase methods for state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives under the principle of encouraging the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and ensuring the completion of the national grain unified purchase task, so that the state's grain unified purchase methods are gradually improved to meet the needs of the gradual institutionalization of grain unified purchase work.

    正确贯彻粮食统购政策
    刘春
    实行粮食统购工作一年来的经验证明，除了在党的直接领导下，做好政治工作和经济工作而外，还必须根据国家的粮食统购政策和法令，因地制宜地规定简便易行的粮食统购办法。这对于正确贯彻粮食统购政策，简化手续，节省时间，保证完成粮食统购任务，以及促进粮食统购工作的逐步制度化，是完全必要的。
    在去年粮食统购工作中，各地一般地是采用“调查农民的余粮，自上而下地逐级颁发任务控制数字，动员农民自报，结合民主评议”的办法。这在初次实行粮食统购，对农村粮食产、消、余、缺的极其复杂的情况还不清楚，干部又缺乏经验的情况下，是切合实际的。这样做既利于教育农民，又利于因地制宜、实事求是的完成任务。在去年那样的情况下，这种办法是利多害少，因而是必要的正确的。但由于没有一个具体的办法，作为干部和农民执行国家粮食统购政策的具体依据，以致有些地区在粮食统购工作中，政治觉悟高的农民带头多卖了余粮，甚至有的卖掉了口粮；较落后的人没有卖足；对富农更没有一个具体的约束，因而就产生了畸轻畸重的现象；同时，又由于全面评议，面大事繁，工作进行较慢，也在一定程度上影响了其他各项农村工作和农业生产。在今年夏季小麦统购期间，各地在过去的经验的基础上，规定了一些比较简便的统购办法。从执行结果来看，干部觉得有了办法，增强了信心，偏向发生得少；农民觉得摸到了政策的底，消除了顾虑，踊跃售粮。
    各地制定的办法，形式虽然不同，但一般都抓住了查实产量、核定开支标准、规定统购率，结合民主评议四个基本环节，这是非常必要的。
    查实粮食产量，是正确贯彻粮食统购标准和合理的分配粮食统购任务的重要关键。这是一项关系着广大农民的直接利益的复杂工作，必须进行适当的思想工作和必要的组织工作。根据去年秋季和今年夏季粮食统购工作中评定产量的经验：首先要教育乡村干部，使他们真正懂得粮食统购政策，并由乡干部组成评议小组或评议委员会，认真地、实事求是地评定产量。定产应以实际产量为根据，但方法须力求简便易行。农业税常年应产量和去年统购中有关产量的材料，必须充分运用。在实产量和应产量大体一致的地区，可依应产量计算；在实产量高于应产量，但两者的差额大小大体一致的地区，则以按应产量加成计算的办法为宜；在实产量与应产量悬殊且两者差额又不规则的地区，则须划片估产，但划片不宜太多，分等不宜过细，尤其不能逐户计算。办法拟定后，须交群众进行讨论，经乡人民代表大会会议通过，由上一级人民委员会批准。今年夏季统购中，凡这样做了的地区，评定产量的真实性都达到百分之九十左右，群众满意，工作进展顺利；反之则引起了农民不满，工作也陷于被动。
    为推动农业生产和农业互助合作运动的发展，并保证完成国家粮食统购任务，必须根据“统购余粮，不购口粮”的原则，适当地规定农民的口粮、种籽、饲料开支的标准。由于各地生活习惯、经济条件不一致，在规定上述标准时，一省之内不能硬性规定一个统一的标准，而只能规定一个控制性的一般标准。省内的一个地区或一个县必须本着保证农民够吃、够用的精神，结合具体情况，参照省规定的一般标准，因地制宜地作具体规定。各地计算各项开支标准的经验是：吃粮，按当地一般中农的消费水平，规定每人平均食用量，依据每一农户在家人口计算，对于流动人口按其在家时间留下或剔出口粮；种籽用粮，按种植亩数、粮种，参照当地农民留种习惯确定；牲畜用粮，根据当地骡、马、牛、驴、猪等的一般用料，确定平均标准，按每一农户现有大、小牲畜数量估算。计算用粮的开支时间，应根据各地的粮食收获季节，以整年计算为宜。对于各项开支标准，因为目前不易确切计算，必须根据实事求是的精神，加以掌握。
    为正确贯彻“统购余粮、不购口粮”的原则，还必须合理地规定统购率。统购率必须既能鼓励农民生产积极性，又能保证粮食统购任务的完成，还能体现党在农村中的阶级路线。各地规定统购率的基本经验是：在每人平均土地和产量差额悬殊的地区，必须采用累进制，即根据余粮多少的不同，将余粮户分为若干等级，依级变更统购率，余粮愈多，则统购数量愈多。在每人平均土地和产量大体一致的地区，则可采用比例制，即只规定一个统购率，按比例计购余粮。在粮食统购工作中，对农民的粮食的产、消、余、缺等情况还不能确切掌握起来的时候，为避免影响农民的生产情绪，防止统购工作中可能发生的偏差，还必须给农民留下少量的余粮，由农民自由支配或准其到国家粮食市场进行调剂，这对国家和农民来说都是十分必要的。但留给富农自由支配的余粮，不能超过当地一般中农留粮水平。一切统购率都要既能保证完成统购任务，又能防止余多购少和余少购多、挤了口粮的偏向。有些地区，规定起购点过低，或累进率级差较大，对余粮多的农户规定的累进率较小，以致任务分配得不平衡，发生畸轻畸重的现象，这些都是必须在今后规定统购率时加以研究修正的。
    统购农民的余粮是一项十分复杂而细致的工作，只依靠上述几种标准，还不能完全解决合理分配粮食统购任务的问题。为弥补上述标准的不足，还须辅之以民主评议。根据过去的经验，一般地应采取两头评议的办法，即统购农户按统购办法计算分配任务后，确有困难的可以评议减免，余粮仍然很多的亦可评议多售。这样，对余粮少的，不致于挤了口粮，对余粮多的，亦可达到多购的目的。评议面应力求缩小。由乡的党团员、积极分子和乡干部组成评议委员会，负责组织群众进行评议，力求达到基本上公平合理。
    现在各地秋季粮食统购工作已经开始了，我们必须充分认识到，各地已经规定的粮食统购办法，仍然是粗率而不完备的。我们必须注意在工作中不断地积累经验，加以修正。也要看到，随着我国农业互助合作运动的迅速发展，国家取得商品粮食的来源将逐渐在国营农场和农业生产合作社中增多起来，因此，还必须在鼓励发展农业生产互助合作和保证完成国家粮食统购任务的原则下，对国营农场和农业生产合作社，逐步制定出切实可行的粮食统购办法，使国家粮食统购办法日臻完备，以适应粮食统购工作逐步制度化的需要。
