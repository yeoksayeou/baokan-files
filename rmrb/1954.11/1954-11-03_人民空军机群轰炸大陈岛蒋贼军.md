Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, November 2nd: Our correspondent reports from the Zhejiang front: On November 1st, the People's Liberation Army Air Force bombed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on Dachen Island. On that day, the skies over eastern Zhejiang were clear and cloudless. Around 11 a.m., the war eagles of our People's Air Force flew into the sky in good order, looking like clusters of rockets, heading straight for the Dachen area. At this time, Dachen Island was deathly still. Near the northeast corner of Dachen Island, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship was moored, and some Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers were walking lazily on the deck.

In the blink of an eye, plumes of smoke suddenly rose from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on the southwest corner of Upper Dachen Island. Then came the sound of exploding bombs. Observers from the coastal defense forces shouted: "Our planes are sending lunch to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits!"

Our air force planes continuously dived and bombed and strafed the ground military targets and naval vessels of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands. As soon as one group of planes flew up, another group dived down. Plumes of black smoke immediately rose from the positions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Upper and Lower Dachen Islands. Fires broke out on the ground and at sea, and the entire Dachen area was immediately engulfed in smoke and fire. Our coastal defense troops cheered: "Bomb them well! Bomb them again!"

After our People's Air Force planes successfully completed their bombing mission, the coastal defense soldiers waved their military caps together, watching the squadrons of war eagles safely return to base.

    人民空军机群轰炸大陈岛蒋贼军
    【新华社浙江前线二日电】本社记者自浙东前线报道：十一月一日，我人民解放军机群轰炸大陈岛蒋贼军。当日上午，浙东天空，晴朗无云。十一时许，我人民空军的战鹰们，秩序井然地飞向天空，它们好像一簇簇火箭，直飞大陈地区上空。这时，大陈岛上死气沉沉，在大陈岛东北角附近的海面上，停泊着一艘蒋贼军舰，军舰甲板上有些蒋贼军士兵在懒散地走动着。
    转眼之后，上大陈岛西南角蒋贼军阵地上突然升起了一团团的烟硝。接着，传来了炸弹的爆炸声。海防部队的观察员们高声喊道：“咱们的飞机给蒋贼军送午饭了！”
    我空军机群连续不断地向上、下大陈岛蒋贼军的地面军事目标和海上舰艇进行俯冲轰炸和扫射，这一群飞机刚飞起来，另一群飞机又接着俯冲下去。上、下大陈岛蒋贼军阵地上立即升起了一团团黑色的烟雾。地上和海上都起火了，整个大陈地区顿时被烟火吞没了。我军海防部队战士们欢呼：“轰得好啊！再炸！”
    当我人民空军机群胜利完成轰炸任务后，海防战士们一齐挥着军帽，目送着一队队安然返航的战鹰。
