The Chinese Academy of Sciences Hosts Metal Research Report Conference

The Metal Research Report Conference, sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was held in Beijing from October 25th to November 3rd. More than 480 scientists, professors, engineers, and other personnel from 95 units, including relevant research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, research institutions of relevant industrial departments, factories, and universities, participated in this report conference. Fifteen Soviet experts working in industrial departments and universities were also invited to participate.

At the opening ceremony, Zhang Jiafu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a report, emphasizing the importance of metal research work and giving important instructions on issues such as linking theory with practice and creative cooperation between scientific research institutions, industrial departments, and universities. Lü Dong, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the People's Republic of China, reported on the development of China's metallurgical industry and existing problems, and put forward hopes and requirements to metallurgical scientists based on the tasks of the metallurgical industry in the future.

Scientific workers from various units presented a total of seventy-six research work reports at the conference, belonging to six aspects: iron and steel smelting and processing, refractory materials, nodular cast iron, non-ferrous metal smelting and processing, mineral processing, metal physics, and material inspection. The report conference was divided into five groups to discuss these reports, carry out free academic debates, evaluate each report, point out the achievements and shortcomings of each report, the direction of further research, and the significance of the research work in the national economy or scientific theory and the possibility of practical promotion and application.

Soviet experts Griguli, Sknohohof, and Zavyriev were invited to give special reports at the meeting, which greatly inspired the representatives. British famous physicist Bernal was also invited to give a report at the meeting.

According to the summary report made by Yan Jici, head of the technical science department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on behalf of the presidium of the report conference, the conference made a resolution. The resolution affirmed the achievements of metal scientific research work in the past five years, the shortcomings existing in metal scientific research work, and pointed out the basic direction of metal scientific research work in the future.

The conference resolved to establish a "Metal Research Work Coordination Committee" and a "Metal Research Work Report Conference Journal Editorial Committee" composed of scientists and leaders from relevant research institutions, universities, and relevant industrial departments, and approved the list of members of the two committees.

    中国科学院主办金属研究工作报告会
    中国科学院主办的金属研究工作报告会十月二十五日至十一月三日在北京举行。参加这次报告会的，有中国科学院有关研究所、各有关产业部门的研究机构、工厂和高等学校等九十五个单位的科学家、教授、工程师和其他人员共四百八十多人。应邀参加报告会的，还有在产业部门和高等学校中工作的苏联专家十五人。
    在开幕式中，中国科学院副院长张稼夫作了报告，他强调了金属研究工作的重要性，并对理论联系实际以及科学研究机关、产业部门和高等学校之间的创造性合作等问题作了重要指示。中华人民共和国重工业部副部长吕东报告了我国冶金工业发展情况和存在的问题，并根据今后冶金工业的任务向冶金科学工作者提出了希望和要求。
    各单位的科学工作者在报告会上提出的研究工作报告共有七十六篇，分属钢铁冶炼及加工、耐火材料、球墨铸铁、有色金属冶炼及加工、选矿、金属物理和材料检验等六个方面。报告会分成五个小组讨论了这些报告，开展了学术上的自由争论，对每个报告作出了评价，指出了每个报告的成绩和缺点、进一步研究的方向，以及该项研究工作在国民经济上或科学理论上的意义和在实际推广应用上的可能性。
    苏联专家格里古里、斯克诺霍道夫和扎维里耶夫应邀在会上作了专题报告，对到会代表有很大启发。英国著名物理学家贝尔纳也应邀在会上作了报告。
    会议根据中国科学院技术科学部门负责人严济慈代表报告会主席团所作的总结报告，作出了决议。决议肯定了五年来金属科学研究工作的成就、金属科学研究工作中存在的缺点，并指出了今后金属科学研究工作的基本方向。
    会议决议成立由有关研究机关、高等学校以及有关产业部门的科学家及领导人员组成“金属研究工作协调委员会”和“金属研究工作报告会会刊编辑委员会”，并通过了两个委员会的委员名单。
