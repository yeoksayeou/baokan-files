    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and many relevant units are earnestly handling the proposals from the First Session of the First Tianjin Municipal People's Congress. The First Session of the First Tianjin Municipal People's Congress received a total of 10,897 proposals, which were consolidated into 1,614 items. After the closing of the meeting, the Municipal People's Government transferred the proposals to relevant departments for handling. After receiving the proposals, the Municipal People's Government Tax Bureau convened a special meeting to specifically arrange the handling of the proposals. The Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Real Estate Management Bureau and other units also formulated proposal handling plans and carried out the handling in a planned manner. Some proposals that could be implemented immediately based on existing conditions were adopted and implemented as much as possible. According to the proposal of Chen Yongcheng, a technician of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, the Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau has begun preparing for the construction of a city-wide electrical testing laboratory. After receiving the reply to his proposal, Chen Yongcheng said happily: "The country respects the people's opinions so much, it's really great."
    Among the proposals, some were criticisms from the people of the government's work and staff. For example, some residents raised concerns about the work style of some cadres in the First District. After this proposal was submitted to the First District People's Government, the First District People's Government immediately sent cadres to visit the proposers, and handed over the proposers' specific opinions to the relevant departments under the First District People's Government for inspection and resolution, which improved the work style of some staff members in these departments.
    For some proposals that were already stipulated in existing laws and regulations and had been dealt with by the government, the relevant units explained the situation to the proposers; some proposals that could not be implemented immediately were also explained to the proposers.

    天津市人民政府认真处理人民代表的提案
    天津市人民政府和许多有关单位，正在认真处理天津市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议提案。天津市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议共收到提案一万零八百九十七件，经整理归纳为一千六百一十四件。会议闭幕后，市人民政府分别将提案转送有关部门负责处理。市人民政府税务局接到提案后，召集了专门会议具体布置提案处理工作。市人民政府工商局、公用局、房地产管理局等单位，还制订了提案处理计划，有步骤地进行处理。有些提案根据现有条件能立即办到的，都尽量采纳照办了。市人民政府公用局根据天津电业局技术员陈涌澄的提案，已开始筹建全市性的电气试验所。陈涌澄接到提案答复后高兴地说：“国家这样尊重人民的意见，真是太好了。”
    在提案中，也有一部分是人民群众对政府工作和工作人员的批评意见。如有些居民对一区部分机关干部的工作作风提出了意见，这一提案交到一区人民政府后，一区人民政府立即派干部访问了提案人，把提案人的具体意见交给一区人民政府所属有关部门检查和解决，改进了这些部门部分工作人员的工作作风。
    有一些提案在现有法令中已有规定的和政府已经处理了的，有关单位向提案人作了说明；一部分不能立即实现的提案，也向提案人作了解释。  （新华社）
