    The Foziling Reservoir project, a part of the Huai River harnessing project, has been successfully completed. On the 5th, a completion ceremony was held at the reservoir site. At 8:00 a.m., more than 10,000 people gathered in front of the reservoir's multiple-arch dam, including the builders of the reservoir, guests from various regions who came specifically to attend the ceremony, and farmers from around Foziling. Bright flags planted along the top of the dam fluttered in the high sky. Construction of the Foziling Reservoir began in January 1952 and was fully completed at the end of October this year. After the completion of this reservoir, it can hold 580 million cubic meters of floodwater, irrigate 700,000 mu of farmland, and generate 9,500 kilowatts of electricity.
    After the commencement of the reservoir's completion ceremony, the flood discharge gate below the multiple-arch dam was opened, and huge water splashes sprayed from the gate. At the same time, the electricity generated from the reservoir illuminated all the colored lights on top of the multiple-arch dam, announcing the birth of the first hydroelectric power station in the Huai River basin. At this moment, a burst of applause erupted from the crowd. As the ceremony came to an end, people, led by the band, walked to the top of the multiple-arch dam, parading along the arc-shaped passage connecting each arch. Here, people could overlook the entire reservoir's scenery.
    In the evening, the lights illuminated by the reservoir's power station decorated the reservoir with brilliance.

    佛子岭水库工程全部完工
    治淮工程中的佛子岭水库工程已经胜利竣工，五日，在水库工地举行了竣工典礼。上午八点钟，水库的建筑者们、专来参加典礼的各地来宾和佛子岭周围的农民共一万多人集合在水库的连拱坝前面。沿着坝顶插起的鲜艳的旗帜，在高空中飘扬。佛子岭水库自一九五二年一月开始建筑，在今年十月底全部完工。这个水库建成后，可拦蓄洪水五亿八千万立方公尺，使七十万亩田地获得灌溉，并可发电九千五百瓩。
    在水库竣工典礼开始后，连拱坝下面的泄水闸门启开，从闸门中喷出巨大的水花；同时，从水库发出的电力，使连拱坝顶上的彩色电灯一齐明亮，宣告淮河流域第一个水力发电站的诞生。这时候，从人群中响起一片掌声。典礼进行到最后，由乐队领着人们走到连拱坝顶上，在一个个拱顶连接起来的弧形通道上沿着坝顶游行。人们在这里可以眺望整个水库的风光。
    晚上，用水库发电站的电力点亮的灯光把水库装饰得辉煌灿烂。
