Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 27th: This year, more than 27,000 outstanding farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have joined the Communist Party of China. Currently, there are more than 47,000 Party members in rural areas of Guizhou Province, and more than 4,600 Communist Party branches have been established, with the number of townships having established branches accounting for 70 percent of the province's total.

This year, Communist Party branches and members in rural areas of Guizhou Province have achieved significant results in leading farmers of all ethnic groups to consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, as well as in striving for increased agricultural production. Since the beginning of spring, under the leadership of the branches and the guidance of Party members, farmers of all ethnic groups in the province have successively established more than 3,500 agricultural producers' cooperatives, enabling more than 260,000 mutual aid teams to be improved and developed. On the basis of the development and consolidation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, Communist Party branches in rural areas of Guizhou Province have also actively cooperated with the People's Government to lead farmers in improving farming techniques and overcoming various natural disasters, thereby increasing the province's total grain output by 7 percent on top of last year's increase. After the Gaoping Township Party Branch in Zunyi County led farmers to establish ten agricultural producers' cooperatives, it ensured increased agricultural production throughout the township. Party members of the Miao Autonomous Region in Lushan County led Miao farmers to establish four agricultural producers' cooperatives this spring, resulting in an increase of more than 29 percent in agricultural production.

Farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province enthusiastically support the leadership of the Communist Party. In many areas, farmers have elected Communist Party members as leaders of agricultural producers' cooperatives or mutual aid teams. Sixty-seven Party members in the thirty-one agricultural producers' cooperatives of the Miao Autonomous Region in Lushan County were elected as members of the cooperative's production management committee, and fifty of these Party members were elected as directors or deputy directors of the cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 26th: In Yunnan Province, more than 5,000 outstanding members of various ethnic minorities have joined the Communist Party of China. Among the Yi, Dai, and Bai ethnic groups in Yunnan Province, there are more than 2,000 Communist Party members.

Most of these Party members were developed this year and are distributed in various work positions throughout the province, with many of them holding leadership positions. There are more than 1,000 ethnic minority Party member cadres at or above the equivalent of district committee members in the province; nearly 100 of them are ethnic minority Party member cadres at the county level or above. Li Guiying, a female Yi Communist Party member who was tempered in the guerrilla war in Yunnan before liberation, was recently elected as a representative to the National People's Congress due to her achievements in ethnic work and the trust of the people. In areas of Yunnan Province where ethnic groups live in mixed communities, many ethnic minority Party members have become the backbone of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many ethnic minority cadres who are active in ethnic work teams in various border regions of the motherland have been tempered in their work, and many have joined the Communist Party. Among the seventeen new Party members accepted by the Luxi County Communist Party organization in August this year, seven were members of ethnic work teams from the Yi, Naxi, Lisu, and Hani ethnic groups. Most of them have worked in the border regions for two or three years and have established close ties with the local people.

    贵州百分之七十乡建立党支部
    云南少数民族优秀分子五千人加入共产党
    【新华社贵阳二十七日电】今年贵州省已有两万七千多个优秀的各族农民参加了中国共产党。目前贵州省农村中已有四万七千多个党员，建立了四千六百多个共产党支部，建立支部的乡占全省总乡数的百分之七十。
    今年贵州省农村中的共产党支部和党员在领导各族农民巩固和发展互助合作组织，以及争取农业增产工作中已经获得了重大成绩。入春以来，在支部领导和党员的带领下，全省各族农民先后建立了三千五百多个农业生产合作社，使二十六万多个互助组得到提高和发展。贵州省农村的共产党支部还在互助合作组织发展和巩固的基础上，配合人民政府积极领导农民改进耕作技术，战胜各种自然灾害，从而使全省粮食产量在去年增产的基础上又增产百分之七。遵义县高坪乡党支部，领导农民建立起十个农业生产合作社后，保证了全乡农业增产。炉山县苗族自治区党员领导苗族农民在今年春天成立了四个农业生产合作社，使得农业生产量增加百分之二十九以上。
    贵州省各族农民都热情拥护共产党的领导，许多地区的农民都推选共产党员当农业生产合作社或互助组的领导人。炉山县苗族自治区三十一个农业生产合作社中的六十七个党员都被选为社的生产管理委员会委员，其中有五十个党员被选为社的正副主任。
    【新华社昆明二十六日电】 云南省各少数民族中，已有五千多个优秀分子加入了中国共产党。云南省境内的彝族、傣族、民家等三种民族中，就有两千多个共产党员。
    这些党员大多是在今年内发展的，他们分布在全省各地各种工作岗位上，其中有许多人担任着领导工作。全省相当于区委委员以上的少数民族党员干部有一千多人；其中县级以上的少数民族党员干部将近有一百人。解放前在云南游击战争中经过锻炼的彝族女共产党员李桂英，由于在民族工作中作出了成绩，得到人民的信任，不久前当选为全国人民代表大会代表。在云南省内地民族杂居地区，有许多少数民族党员已成为农业生产合作社中的骨干。活跃在祖国边疆各地的民族工作队中的少数民族干部，在工作中得到锻炼，有许多人已加入了共产党。潞西县共产党组织今年八月接收的十七名新党员中，有七个是彝族、纳西族、傈僳族、哈尼族的民族工作队队员。他们大多已在边疆工作了两三年，和当地人民建立了密切的联系。
