Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 4th: Japan's Communist Party Central Committee organ, "Akahata," published an editorial on October 25th titled "The Issue of War Criminals in China," calling on the Japanese people to respond to the Sino-Soviet joint declaration on relations with Japan’s principle of peaceful coexistence, to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and to reciprocate China's lenient policy towards former Japanese criminal soldiers.

The editorial stated: Not long ago, four hundred and seventeen former Japanese soldiers who had committed various crimes received amnesty due to the lenient policy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The generous treatment these people received in China is deeply moving.

The editorial quoted the impressions of Kiyotaro Shimizu, a member of the Japanese Peace Delegation, regarding the Chinese people's attitude of hatred towards Japanese militarists and their friendly attitude towards the Japanese people during his visit to China. Kiyotaro Shimizu said: Everyone he visited said, "Japanese militarists are not the same as the Japanese people. The Japanese people are not guilty." He was deeply moved by the Chinese people's sincere friendship towards the Japanese people.

The editorial continued: The emotion felt by Kiyotaro Shimizu is probably unanimously felt by all Japanese who have visited China. When we consider the issue of war criminals in China, this point should not be forgotten under any circumstances. When we think of the enormous losses caused to the Chinese people in the past war of aggression, what should we use to reciprocate China's lenient policy in handling war criminals? This is self-evident.

The editorial finally emphasized: China's lenient policy towards war criminals is a manifestation of great trust in the Japanese people's desire for peace. We must repay this trust. Responding to the call for peaceful coexistence pointed out in the Sino-Soviet joint declaration on relations with Japan, resolutely expressing our determination to defend peace, uniting the strength of the people throughout the country, and preventing the revival of Japanese militarism, this is the way to repay the trust of the Chinese people.

    日本“赤旗报”就日本在华战犯问题发表社论
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”在十月二十五日发表题为“在华战犯问题”的社论，号召日本人民响应中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言的和平共处原则，阻止日本军国主义复活，回答中国对于前日本犯罪军人的宽大政策。
    社论说：不久前，四百一十七名犯有各种罪行的前日本军人，由于中国人民解放军的宽大政策，得到了宽赦。这些人在中国所受的宽大待遇，使人深为感动。
    社论引了日本和平代表团团员清水几太郎在访问中国时中国人民对日本军国主义者的仇恨态度和对日本人民的友好态度的感想。清水几太郎说：他访问的人都说：“日本军国主义者和日本人民不一样。日本人民是没有什么罪过的。”他为中国人民这种对日本人民的真诚友好，深深感动。
    社论接着说：清水几太郎身受的感动恐怕是所有访问过中国的日本人一致感受到的。当我们考虑在华战犯问题时，这一点是无论如何都不应当忘记的。我们一想到过去在侵略战争中给中国人民造成的损失是何等大的时候，我们应当拿什么来回答中国处理战犯的宽大政策呢？这是不说也可以明白的。
    社论最后强调说：中国施于战犯的宽大政策是对日本人民的和平意志的巨大信任的表现。我们必须回报这个信任。响应中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言所指出的和平共处的号召，坚决表示保卫和平的决心，团结全国人民力量，阻止日本军国主义复活，这才是回答中国人民的信任的途径。
