    Passengers Request Emphasis on Newspaper Retail on Trains
    Reader Xiao Guang writes: Newspaper retail is an important form of newspaper distribution. Through retail, newspapers are delivered to readers who cannot subscribe regularly for various reasons, ensuring that people with reading ability and a desire to read newspapers can conveniently purchase them. This is the glorious task of newspaper distributors, and also the task of all departments qualified to act as agents.

    According to public feedback, newspaper retail on railway trains is still a weak link. Selling newspapers on trains started relatively early, but due to the lack of a clear agency policy, passenger demand cannot be met. Some service personnel who also handle newspaper sales often prioritize economic income. They compare newspapers to candies and cigarettes, thinking that newspapers generate less profit, and unsold newspapers would lead to losses, so it's better to order less. Some railway bureaus and train sections are afraid of trouble and simply do not act as agents. Therefore, only some major routes sell newspapers. The number of copies sold not only has not increased for a long time, but even cannot maintain the original number. For example, in the first half of this year, due to train schedule changes and changes in train sections, the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Hankou trains departing from Beijing once stopped selling newspapers. Although they continued to sell newspapers later, the quantity has been greatly reduced.

    Passengers request to see newspapers on trains, and hope that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Railways will promptly consult and make a decision, clarifying the policy of agency sales of newspapers on railways. They also propose formulating measures for agency sales of newspapers on national railways, first requiring that each line that originally sold newspapers should not stop selling or drastically reduce the number of copies sold due to train schedule changes, and then gradually expand to all lines nationwide.

### 乘客要求列车上重视报纸零售

    乘客要求列车上重视报纸零售
    读者晓光来信：报纸的零售工作是发行报纸的一种重要形式。通过零售方式，把报纸送给因种种原因不能定期订阅的读者，让具有读报能力和有读报要求的人都能很方便地买到报纸，这是报纸发行人员的光荣任务，也是一切有条件担任代销工作的部门的任务。
    据群众反映，在铁路的列车上，零售报纸的发行还是一个薄弱的一环。在列车上推销报纸是开始得较早的，但是由于代销方针不够明确，以致不能满足乘客的要求。有些兼管售报的服务员，多从经济收入上作打算，把报纸和糖果纸烟相比，认为赚钱少，卖不光要赔钱，还是少要些好；有些铁路局和列车段有怕麻烦思想，就索性不代销。因此，一直只有一些主要路线上代销报纸。销售份数，不但长期没有增加，甚至不能保持原数，如今年上半年因火车改点，调换了列车段，从北京开出的京沪、京汉车曾一度停止卖报，后来虽然继续办理，但数量已经大大减少。
    乘客们要求在列车上看到报纸，希望邮电部同铁道部迅速进行商洽，并作出决定，明确在铁路上代销报纸的方针。并拟订全国铁路代销报纸的办法，首先要求原来卖报的各线不因火车改点而停止销售或因此而大量减少份数，然后，逐步扩展到全国各线去。
