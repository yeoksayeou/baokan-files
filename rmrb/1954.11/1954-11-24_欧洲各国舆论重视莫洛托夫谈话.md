Xinhua News Agency, Berlin dispatch from TASS: On November 21st, Berlin's democratic newspapers prominently published the full text of V.M. Molotov's answers to questions from a "Pravda" reporter regarding foreign policy issues. "Neues Deutschland" was headlined "V.M. Molotov Says Agreement on Germany is Possible."

West Berlin newspapers, based on reports from bourgeois news agencies, cited Molotov's replies to the "Pravda" reporter. Most newspapers prominently published this news.

The West Berlin "Telegraf" wrote: "Molotov emphasized that talks between the West and the Soviet Union on the issue of German reunification would only be meaningful if the Western countries abandoned their policy of remilitarizing the Federal Republic within the Western military bloc system. The Soviet Foreign Minister refuted the argument that the ratification of the Paris Agreements would not affect future talks."

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd dispatch from TASS, Paris, November 22nd: French public opinion attaches great importance to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's replies to questions from a "Pravda" reporter.

The November 21st "l'Humanité Dimanche" wrote: "In answering questions from a 'Pravda' reporter, Molotov frankly warned the Western countries that the arming of West Germany greatly deepened the danger of war breaking out in Europe. After pointing out this fact, the Soviet Union reiterated its proposal to convene a European conference to conclude a European collective security treaty... What could be more in line with the interests of the French people? The French people should now make their voices heard, especially since Mendès-France did not even seriously read the full text of the Soviet proposal before expressing direct rejection of the Soviet proposal in Washington."

"Le Journal du Dimanche" wrote, "The impression is that Molotov's statement has two purposes: on the one hand, to answer people like Chancellor Adenauer, who emphasize that it is impossible to prepare seriously if a conference is convened on November 29th; on the other hand, to refute the Western countries' argument that there will be ample time to negotiate with Moscow after the two agreements are ratified."

An Agence France-Presse commentator wrote that Molotov's answers to the "Pravda" reporter answered "a fundamental objection of the Western countries to the (Soviet) note of November 13th: that there is not enough time to prepare for a conference to be convened on November 29th." The commentator cited some of Molotov's words, saying: a reunited "Germany will participate in the equal family of European peoples and will play an important role in organizing European collective security," and "the issue of free all-German elections by secret ballot and the guarantee of the democratic rights of the all-German people" is one on which agreement is possible. The commentator pointed out that Molotov's argument is very attractive to "Germans who regard reunifying their homeland as their main goal." The commentator believes that the characteristic of the Soviet position is: Molotov warned that "if the Paris Agreements are ratified, German reunification will be impossible," while saying that "it is possible to reach an agreement on the German issue."

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd dispatch from TASS: Molotov's answers to the "Pravda" reporter on foreign policy issues have aroused widespread reaction in British, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish newspapers.

The British "Times," "Manchester Guardian," and "Scotsman" all published the full text of Molotov's answers to the reporter. The "Times" and the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" published editorials. Both newspapers advocated the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany.

The "Times" rehashed the usual arguments used by bourgeois propaganda organs, attempting to attribute the failure to reach an agreement on the German issue to the Soviet Union.

Observers from the "Daily Express" and the "Financial Times" believe that the British Foreign Office will oppose any delay in considering the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

The major British local newspapers paid particular attention to Molotov's suggestion that if the Western countries postponed considering the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the European Security Conference originally scheduled for November 29th could also be postponed. These newspapers also emphasized Molotov's statement that if the Western countries proceed with their plan to remilitarize West Germany, the peace-loving European countries will have to consider taking new measures to ensure their security.

Many Stockholm morning newspapers prominently summarized Molotov's answers to the reporter. "Dagens Nyheter" was headlined "Moscow's New Action to Strive for a Conference." "Svenska Dagbladet"'s headline pointed out that Molotov had issued "a severe warning, indicating that the Paris Agreements are a threat to peace." Many newspapers emphasized that the Soviet government had stated that as long as the Western countries agree to postpone the discussion of the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the date of the conference to discuss European security issues could be changed.

Norwegian newspapers summarized Molotov's remarks. "Friheten"'s headline was: "Molotov Says: If the Paris Agreements are Approved, the Danger of War in Europe will Increase. If the ratification of the agreement on rearming West Germany is postponed, the conference to discuss European security issues can be postponed." "Aftenposten"'s headline was: "Molotov Makes Another Effort to Prevent the Paris Agreements from Being Realized."

Finnish newspapers prominently published Molotov's answers to the "Pravda" reporter. "Vapaa Sana"'s headline wrote: "The Paris Agreements Prepare for a New War. If these agreements are approved, then the people of Europe will have to consider taking new measures to ensure their security." "Kansan Uutiset" emphasized in its headline that organizing a common security system is the only way to achieve peace in Europe.

    欧洲各国舆论重视莫洛托夫谈话
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社柏林讯：十一月二十一日，柏林各民主报纸都以显著地位登载了维·米·莫洛托夫对“真理报”记者提出的有关外交政策问题的答复全文。“新德意志报”的标题是“维·米·莫洛托夫说，关于德国的协议是可能达成的。”
    西柏林的报纸根据资产阶级通讯社的消息，引述了莫洛托夫答“真理报”记者问。大多数报纸都在显著地位登载了这条消息。
    西柏林“电讯报”写道：“莫洛托夫着重指出，只有西方国家放弃它们在西方军事集团体系内使联邦共和国重新军国主义化的政策，西方和苏联就恢复德国统一问题进行会谈才有意义。苏联外交部长反驳了批准巴黎协定不会影响未来的会谈这种论调。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法国舆论十分重视苏联外交部长莫洛托夫答
  “真理报”记者问。
    二十一日“人道报星期日刊”写道：“莫洛托夫在答‘真理报’记者问时十分坦白地警告西方国家：武装西德大大加深了欧洲爆发战争的危险性。苏联在指出这一事实后，再度重申关于召开欧洲会议以缔结欧洲集体安全协定的建议……还有什么比这个更符合法国人民的利益呢？法国人民现在应当使自己的呼声为别人听到，特别是由于孟戴斯—弗朗斯甚至不认真地念完苏联建议全文就在华盛顿表示直接拒绝苏联的建议”。
    “星期日报”报纸写道，“给人的印象是，莫洛托夫这个声明有两个目的：一方面是答复阿登纳总理之类的人，这些人强调说，如果在十一月二十九日召开会议就不可能认真进行准备；另一方面反驳西方国家的论点，即，认为在两个协定批准后会有充裕的时间和莫斯科进行谈判。”
    法新社评论员写道，莫洛托夫答“真理报”记者问答复了“西方国家反对（苏联）十一月十三日照会的一个基本意见：要在十一月二十九日召开会议是来不及准备的”。评论员援引莫洛托夫答记者问中的一些话，这些话说：重新统一的“德国将参加欧洲各国人民的平等的大家庭，并将在组织欧洲的集体安全方面担当重要的作用”，以及“以秘密投票方式进行的全德自由选举问题和保证全德人民的民主权利问题”是有可能取得协议的。评论员指出，莫洛托夫提出的论点对“把重新统一祖国作为主要目标的德国人”是有很大吸引力的。评论员认为苏联立场的特点是：莫洛托夫警告，“如果批准巴黎协定，德国重新统一就不可能了”，同时说“就德国问题达成协议是可能的”。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社讯：莫洛托夫就外交政策问题答“真理报”记者问引起英国、瑞典、挪威、芬兰报纸的广泛反应。
    英国的“泰晤士报”、“曼彻斯特卫报”、“苏格兰人报”都刊载了莫洛托夫答记者问的全文，
  “泰晤士报”和“每日电讯与晨邮报”发表了社论。这两家报纸主张迅速批准武装西德的巴黎协定。
  “泰晤士报”重新搬出资产阶级宣传机关惯用的论调，企图把没有能够在德国问题上达成协议归咎于苏联。
   “每日快报”和“金融时报”的观察家认为英国外交部将反对任何延迟考虑批准巴黎协定问题的做法。
    英国主要的地方报纸特别注意莫洛托夫所提出的这样的建议：假使西方国家延期考虑批准巴黎协定，原订在十一月二十九日召开的欧洲安全会议也可以延期举行。这些报纸并且强调指出莫洛托夫谈话中的这样一段话：假使西方国家着手执行他们的使西德重新军国主义化的计划的话，爱好和平的欧洲国家将不得不考虑采取新措施以保证它们的安全。
    斯德哥尔摩许多晨报以显著地位摘要刊登了莫洛托夫的答记者问。“每日新闻”的标题是：“莫斯科争取召开会议的新行动”。“晨报”的标题指出，莫洛托夫已作出“严厉的警告，指明巴黎协定是对和平的威胁”。许多报纸强调指出，苏联政府已表示只要西方国家同意延期讨论批准巴黎协定的问题，讨论欧洲安全问题会议的日期是可以改变的。
    挪威各报摘要刊载了莫洛托夫的谈话，“自由报”的标题是：“莫洛托夫说：如果巴黎协定获得批准，欧洲将增加战争的危险。如果延期批准关于重新武装西德的协定，讨论欧洲安全问题的会议是可以延期的。”“晚邮报”的标题是：“莫洛托夫再一次努力不使巴黎协定实现。”
    芬兰的报纸以显著地位登载了莫洛托夫答“真理报”记者问。“自由谈”的标题写道：“巴黎协定为一次新的战争进行准备。如果这些协定得到批准，那么欧洲人民将不得不考虑采取新措施来保证他们的安全。”“劳动人民报”在标题中强调说，组织一个共同安全体系是实现欧洲和平的唯一道路。
