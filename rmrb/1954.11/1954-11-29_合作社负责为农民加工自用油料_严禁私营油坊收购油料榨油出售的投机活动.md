Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently issued a joint directive on organizing the processing of oil crops for farmers' own use, based on the principle of processing oil crops for farmers' own use stipulated in the "Instructions on Mobilizing Farmers to Increase the Production of Oil Crops" issued by the former Government Administration Council on September 19, 1954. This is to facilitate farmers in processing oil crops for their own use and to prevent speculative activities such as private oil mills purchasing oil crops for oil extraction and sale.

The joint directive stipulates that the processing of oil crops for farmers' own use shall be uniformly managed by the supply and marketing cooperatives. The supply and marketing cooperatives should, based on the local conditions of farmers' oil crops for their own use, oil extraction habits, and the season for applying cake fertilizer, organize rural native oil mills in a planned way to facilitate farmers in processing oil crops for their own use. The oil mills of the supply and marketing cooperatives should provide full convenience to farmers in the region to process oil crops for their own use, and allow farmers to exchange oil crops for oil with the cooperative. In areas where the processing capacity of the supply and marketing cooperatives is insufficient, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams' oil mills, and other private oil mills that have been approved by the district and township people's governments should be allowed to accept farmers' oil crops for processing under the supervision of the state-entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives, or farmers should hand over the oil crops to the supply and marketing cooperatives to entrust the above two types of oil mills for processing. In places where there are no supply and marketing cooperative organizations, the local government may conduct supervision.

The directive stipulates that oil mills accepting farmers' processing, except for those of supply and marketing cooperatives, are not allowed to engage in commercial activities such as the purchase and sale of oil crops and oil products. All oil mills that process oil crops for farmers' own use should pay oil and cake according to the original varieties, and should not exchange varieties or withhold oil cake. When farmers voluntarily use a portion of oil crops, oil products, or oil cake to offset processing fees, the supply and marketing cooperatives should purchase them for the needs of local adjustments.

Localities should entrust supply and marketing cooperatives to formulate simple and easy-to-implement management methods for the processing of public and private oil mills, taking the province as a unit. These should include regulations on the reasonable oil yield rate, processing fees, and conversion rate for exchanging materials for oil for various oil crops.

The directive finally pointed out that industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels should strengthen the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives in the processing of oil crops for farmers' own use. Supply and marketing cooperatives should establish necessary supervision and inspection systems for oil mills, and strictly prohibit private oil mills from using the opportunity to process oil crops for farmers to purchase oil crops for oil extraction and sale and other speculative activities, in order to protect the interests of farmers.

    合作社负责为农民加工自用油料
    严禁私营油坊收购油料榨油出售的投机活动
   【新华社二十八日讯】商业部和中华全国供销合作总社，最近根据前政务院一九五四年九月十九日发出的“关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示”中规定的关于农民自用油料加工的原则，发出关于组织农民自用油料加工的联合指示，以便利农民加工自用油料以及防止私营油坊收购油料榨油出售等投机活动。
    联合指示规定，农民自用油料的加工工作，统一由供销合作社负责。供销合作社应根据当地农民自用油料情况、榨油习惯和施用饼肥季节等条件，对农村土榨油坊，有计划地加以组织，便利农民加工自用油料。供销合作社的油坊，应给本地区农民加工自用油料以充分便利，允许农民以油料向合作社换油。在供销合作社加工力量不足的地区，应根据农民的需要，允许经区、乡人民政府批准的农业生产合作社、互助组的油坊和其他私营油坊，在国家委托供销合作社监督下，接受农民加工自用油料，或由农民把油料交供销合作社委托以上两类油坊加工。没有供销合作社机构的地方，可由当地政府进行监督。
    指示规定接受农民加工的油坊，除供销合作社的油坊外，都不准进行油料、油品购销等商业活动。各油坊加工农民自用油料，应按照原来的品种，付油付饼，不得调换品种，或扣留油饼，农民自愿以一部分油料、油品或油饼抵交加工费用时，应由供销合作社收购，以供当地调剂的需要。
    各地应以省为单位委托供销合作社制定简要易行的公私营油坊加工管理办法。其中应包括各种油料合理的出油率、加工费用和以料换油的折合率等的规定。
    指示最后指出，各级工商行政部门应加强供销合作社对农民加工自用油料的领导。供销合作社应对油坊建立必要的监督、检查制度，严格禁止私营油坊利用为农民加工油料的机会收购油料榨油出售等投机活动，以保护农民利益。
