The grassroots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have spread to pastoral areas, rural areas, factories, and mines in Inner Mongolia. In order to extensively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of Inner Mongolia has published more than 40 kinds of books in Mongolian and Chinese, totaling more than 197,000 copies, and purchased more than 4,900 various pictures of Soviet economic construction and 7,600 sets of Mongolian and Chinese wall charts for exhibitions in various places. In Hohhot City alone, more than 260 exhibitions have been held in the past year. In pastoral areas, photo exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union have also been held through gatherings such as the "Nadam" conference. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of Inner Mongolia also invited members of the Chinese peasant delegation to the Soviet Union and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association headquarters delegation to the Soviet Union to introduce the advanced production technologies of Soviet industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and the happy lives of collective farm members.

In order to strengthen cultural exchanges between the people of China and the Soviet Union, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also opened 13 Russian language classes, with 470 students from Mongolian, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups participating in the study. Manzhouli City and Baotou City have also built Sino-Soviet Friendship Palaces and Sino-Soviet Friendship Museums.

A wave of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has been launched among workers in various parts of Inner Mongolia. Workers at the Baotou Flour Mill created the advanced experience of "front flour output" based on Soviet experience, which can increase national production by more than 27.58 billion yuan each year. The Baotou Oil Factory promoted the advanced Soviet experience of "lengthening the fuselage," increasing production efficiency by 50 percent. In the first Nutuke Chahanbulang Gacha of the Urat Front Banner in Ulanqab League, after seeing the happy lives of the Soviet Buryat-Mongolian people in the Sino-Soviet friendship pictures, Mongolian herdsmen realized the benefits of taking the path of collectivization, and they automatically organized three animal husbandry mutual aid groups and a disease prevention and animal protection committee.

    内蒙古中苏友好协会的工作取得成绩
    内蒙古自治区中苏友好协会的基层组织已普及到内蒙古牧区、农村、工厂和矿山。为了广泛地学习苏联先进经验，内蒙古中苏友好协会几年来出版了四十多种蒙、汉文图书十九万七千多册，购制了苏联经济建设各种图片四千九百多张和蒙汉文挂图七千六百套供各地展览。仅呼和浩特市一年来就展览了二百六十多次。在牧业区通过“那达慕”大会等集会，也举办了介绍苏联的图片展览。内蒙古中苏友好协会还邀请访问过苏联的中国农民代表赴苏参观团团员和中苏友好协会总会访苏代表团的团员，分别介绍了苏联工业、农业和牧业的先进生产技术和集体农庄庄员们的幸福生活。
    为加强中苏两国人民之间的文化交流，内蒙古自治区还开办了俄文学校十三个班，有蒙、回、汉等族学员四百七十人参加学习。满洲里市和包头市还建筑了中苏友谊宫和中苏友谊馆。
    在内蒙古各地工人中掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。包头市面粉厂工人根据苏联经验创造了“前路出粉”的先进经验，每年可给国家增产二百七十五亿八千多万元。包头制油厂推广了苏联“加长机身”的先进经验，生产效率提高了百分之五十。在乌兰察布盟乌拉特前旗第一努图克查罕布朗嘎查蒙族牧民，从中苏友好图片上看到苏联布利亚—蒙古民族的幸福生活后，认识到走集体化道路的好处，他们就自动组织了三个畜牧业互助组和一个防疫保畜委员会。（新华社）
