Soviet Science and Technology are the Most Advanced

Advanced Method of Electric Furnace Steelmaking

Recently, Ni. Slobodskikh, a steelworker at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, created an advanced method of electric furnace steelmaking, reducing the charging time for each furnace of steel from 50 minutes to 27 minutes; it also saves 59 minutes of steel melting time; and the tapping time can be advanced by one and a half hours. This method is: when charging scrap steel into the electric furnace, instead of charging it twice as usual, it is charged continuously. When the furnace is half full, the power is turned on, and when the metal has melted and sunk, the power is not turned off, and the furnace is filled with the remaining charge. In this way, the furnace downtime is eliminated, and the charging and melting processes are combined, saving time. Slobodskikh can also work with one less assistant, operated by two people, but the steel produced by the steelmaking furnace can reach 170 percent of the quota.

After Slobodskikh implemented the new method, he could overproduce 331 tons of steel per quarter, saving 10,000 rubles worth of electricity and electrodes.

Slobodskikh's creation attracted the attention of trade union activists in the workshop. They held an experience exchange meeting in the steelmaking department and invited Slobodskikh to introduce his working methods. After comparing the results of the operations, the workshop committee determined the advantages of Slobodskikh's method. Subsequently, the mass production working group committee printed a large number of leaflets to promote it. Steelworkers operating furnaces without mechanized charging have adopted his advanced method.

To date, the entire workshop has produced 8,400 tons more steel than in the same period last year, and has saved an additional 500,000 rubles of state funds.

Maltsev's Tillage Method

Xinhua News Agency.

State farms and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union are widely adopting the new tillage methods created by the famous agricultural innovator Maltsev. The Soviet State Farm Department has decided to promote this tillage method in state farms across the country, using non-moldboard plows to deeply plow one million hectares (15 million *mu*) of fallow land and land for intensive crops in 1954-1955.

In Ukraine, 2,250 collective farms and 175 state farms have already adopted Maltsev's tillage method. Collective farms alone will deeply plow 500,000 hectares of fallow land and autumn-plowed land this autumn using non-moldboard plows. In the Azerbaijan Republic, 500 collective farms have adopted Maltsev's tillage method, and 60,000 hectares of land throughout the republic are being deeply plowed with non-moldboard plows.

Promoting Maltsev's tillage method has great significance for further developing Soviet agriculture and increasing the per-unit-area yield of crops. This tillage method stipulates that fallow land should be deeply plowed to a depth of 40 to 50 centimeters with non-moldboard plows, after which no plowing is needed for three or four consecutive years. Only shallow cultivation and stubble reduction are carried out with disc implements, and a pasture crop rotation system is implemented on the land, rotating pasture, grain, and oil crops. This tillage method can maintain the original layers of each soil layer, eliminate various weeds, reduce damage to the soil structure, and accumulate a large amount of moisture in the soil, thereby increasing soil fertility. Maltsev's tillage method has also made great innovations in the pasture crop rotation system. He criticized the past theory that denied that annual crops could increase soil organic matter and humus, and instead used annual pasture instead of perennial pasture.

    苏联的科学技术是最先进的
    电炉炼钢先进操作法
    斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂炼钢工人尼·斯洛波德斯基赫最近创造了一种电炉炼钢先进操作法，使每炼一炉钢装料时间由五十分钟减为二十七分钟；并使溶钢时间节省五十九分钟；出钢时间能提早一个半小时。这种操作方法是：在向电炉装废钢时不像通常一样分两次装，而是连续不断地装。炉料装满一半即打开电门，当金属已经熔化下沉时，不关闭电门继续将料装满全炉。这样，消灭了炉子停歇现象，并把装料和熔炼两个工序结合起来，节省了时间。斯洛波德斯基赫在工作中还可以少带一个助手，由两个人操作，但炼钢炉出产的钢可以达到定额的百分之一百七十。
    斯洛波德斯基赫实行了新的操作法后，一季可以超额生产三百三十一吨钢，节省价值一万卢布的电力和电极。
    斯洛波德斯基赫的创造引起了车间工会积极分子的注意。他们在炼钢部举行了经验交流会，请斯洛波德斯基赫介绍自己的工作方法。车间委员会在比较了操作结果之后，确定了斯洛波德斯基赫操作方法的优点。随后群众生产工作小组委员会印发了大量的传单加以宣传推广。在装料工作没有机械化的炉子上操作的炼钢工人都已采用了他的先进操作法。
    至今，全车间所生产的钢已比去年同期多八千四百吨，并额外节约了五十万卢布的国家资金。
    马尔采夫的耕作法
    苏联各地国营农场和集体农庄广泛采用著名的农业革新者马尔采夫创造的新耕作方法。苏联国营农场部已决定在全国国营农场普遍推广这种耕作法，在一九五四—一九五五年用不带犁壁的犁深耕一百万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）休闲地和大量播种中耕作物的土地。
    乌克兰现在已有二千二百五十个集体农庄和一百七十五个国营农场采用马尔采夫的耕作法，单是各地集体农庄在今年秋季就要用不带犁壁的犁深耕五十万公顷休闲地和秋耕地。阿塞拜疆共和国采用马尔采夫耕作法的已有五百个集体农庄，全共和国有六万公顷的土地正在用不带犁壁的犁深耕。
    推广马尔采夫耕作法对于进一步发展苏联农业和提高农作物单位面积产量具有巨大的意义。这种耕作法规定，用不带犁壁的犁深耕休闲地四十到五十公分，以后就可以一连三、四年不用再翻耕，只用圆盘农具浅耕减荏，并在土地上实行牧草作物轮种制，轮种牧草、谷物和油料作物。这种耕作方法可以使各层土壤保持原来的层次，消灭各种杂草，减少土壤结构的破坏，并积蓄土壤中的大量水分，从而提高土壤的肥力。马尔采夫的耕作法还对牧草作物轮种制作了很大的革新。他批判了过去否认一年生作物能增加土壤有机物质和腐植质的理论，而采用一年生牧草代替多年生牧草。　（据新华社讯）
