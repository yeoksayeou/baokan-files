Drawing Yongding River Water to Beijing
    Preliminary Design Work Underway

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health Engineering is conducting the preliminary design for the Yongding River water diversion project. This is a trapezoidal channel project approximately nineteen kilometers long. Upon completion, Yongding River water will pass through a one-kilometer-long tunnel, extending eastward past the Eight Great Sites in the Western Hills to Kunming Lake, and then be diverted to factories, water plants, and other locations. In addition to supplying water for the capital's industrial, agricultural irrigation, and domestic use, this channel will also dilute the sewage in the city's moat and provide regular water changes for Beihai Park, Shichahai Lake, and Kunming Lake, maintaining the cleanliness of scenic spots and parks. Two small hydroelectric power stations will be built along the channel to supply some of the capital's electricity.

    In order to smoothly complete this design work, the Ministry of Water Resources Survey and Design Institute of the People's Republic of China also attaches great importance to technical guidance; Soviet experts from the Ministry of Water Resources will specifically guide the implementation of this project. The Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China is also assisting in drilling and researching geological work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    引永定河河水来北京
    初步设计工作正在进行
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局正在进行永定河引水工程的初步设计。这是一条全长约十九公里的梯形渠道工程。完工后，永定河河水将穿过一公里长的隧洞，一直向东经过西山八大处来到昆明湖，再分别引到工厂、自来水厂等处。这条渠道除能供应首都工业用水、农业灌溉和生活用水外，还能稀释护城河的污水，供应北海、什刹海、昆明湖等经常换水；保持风景区和公园的清洁。沿着渠道将要建设两座小型水力发电站，供给首都部分用电。
    为了顺利完成这一设计工作，中华人民共和国水利部勘测设计院也很重视技术指导；水利部的苏联专家将具体指导这一工程的进行。中华人民共和国地质部也正协助钻探和研究地质等工作。（新华社）
