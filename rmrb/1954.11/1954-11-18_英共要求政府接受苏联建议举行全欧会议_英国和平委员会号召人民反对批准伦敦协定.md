    Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: TASS, London, November 16th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 15th. The statement pointed out: The Soviet note "provides a tremendous new opportunity for a lasting and peaceful solution to the European problem. Britain should immediately accept the invitation and use its influence to make the conference a success. This is an alternative to the disastrous policy of rearming Germany, which is currently being pursued by Western European governments."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: According to TASS, London, November 15th: The British Peace Committee issued a statement calling on members of Parliament to vote against the rearmament of Germany during the parliamentary discussions.
    The statement condemned the London Agreements, which permit German rearmament, as betraying the security of Britain and the world, as well as all German peace advocates and the entire German labor movement.
    The statement pointed out: Many members of Parliament are very clear about the meaning of the London Agreements. The present moment is urgent. Every member of Parliament should stand up and speak according to his or her beliefs. Germany should not be rearmed, and everyone who thinks this should say so and vote in favor of it.
    In its statement, the British Peace Committee also issued a call to all political parties, trade union organizations, cooperative organizations, and all peace advocates in factories and rural areas: speak out in the next few days and, collectively or individually, demand that the members of Parliament representing them oppose this measure, which everyone believes poses a terrible danger to Britain and the world.

    英共要求政府接受苏联建议举行全欧会议
    英国和平委员会号召人民反对批准伦敦协定
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦十六日讯：英国共产党执行委员会十五日发表声明。声明指出：苏联照会“为使欧洲问题得到长久的、和平的解决提供了巨大的新机会。英国应当立刻接受邀请，并且利用自己的影响使会议成功。这是西欧各国政府正在奉行的重新武装德国的灾难性政策的替换物。”
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国和平委员会发表声明，要求议员们在议会讨论时投票反对重新武装德国。
    声明斥责准许德国重新武装的伦敦协定出卖英国和全世界的安全，也出卖所有德国的和平拥护者和整个德国的工人运动。
    声明指出：许多议员的心里是很明白伦敦协定的含义的。目前的时刻很紧急。每一个议员都应当挺身而出根据自己的信念发言。德国不应当重新武装起来，每一个有这种想法的人都应当说出这一点来，并投票赞成这一点。
    英国和平委员会在声明中同时向一切政治党派、工会组织、合作社组织以及工厂和城乡各地的全体和平拥护者发出号召：在最近几天内说出自己的话来，并以集体或个人的名义要求代表他们的议员反对这种大家都认为是对英国和世界蕴藏着可怕的危险的措施。
