Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published a commentary on the 10th, commenting on the US appointment of Collins as a special envoy to South Vietnam.

The commentary said: After suffering a crushing defeat at the Geneva Conference, the US imperialists are trying every possible means to sabotage the armistice agreements signed in Geneva. Recently, US President Eisenhower appointed Collins, a US general who participated in the Korean War of aggression, as the US special envoy to South Vietnam. His main task is to implement the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty, step up the establishment of puppet troops, and help Ngo Dinh Diem strengthen his position.

The commentary then described a series of US interventions in Indochina, saying: The US imperialists dragged the French colonialists into the aggressive Southeast Asia Group and included Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam in the so-called protected areas of this group. At the recent Washington Conference, the US imperialists forced the French ruling clique to allow them to directly aid the member states of the Indochina Federation in military, political, and economic aspects. In other words, it is to allow the US imperialists to directly control the Ngo Dinh Diem group and control Cambodia and Laos. The US imperialists helped the French colonialists force some Vietnamese living in North Vietnam to move to the south, and attempted to prevent Vietnam from achieving unification through free general elections.

The commentary continued: At present, the sharp contradictions within the South Vietnamese puppets are caused by the contradictions between French and American imperialists. The increasingly corrupt Ngo Dinh Diem group is deeply resented by the Vietnamese people, and the US imperialists still maintain this traitor in the Bao Dai government in South Vietnam because he is their loyal servant.

The commentary pointed out: The appointment of Collins shows that the US imperialists are more brazenly interfering in the affairs of Indochinese countries and threatening peace in Southeast Asia. However, this also proves that the US imperialists are encountering many difficulties due to the strong opposition of the people to them and the Ngo Dinh Diem group. The contradictions between the French colonialists and the US imperialists are becoming increasingly acute due to the US imperialists' increasingly deep intervention in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The commentary concluded: The Vietnamese people will be more vigilant. They are determined to smash the conspiracies of the US imperialists, the French colonialist elements who sabotage the armistice agreements, and their servant Ngo Dinh Diem gang, and to fight for the French government to earnestly implement the Geneva Accords.

    越南“人民报”评论美国任命柯林斯为驻南越特使
    指责美国干涉印度支那国家事务威胁和平
    【新华社十二日讯】据越南通讯社河内讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”十日发表评论，评美国任命柯林斯为驻南越特使一事。
    评论说：美帝国主义者在日内瓦会议上遭到惨败以后，正在想尽一切可能的办法来破坏在日内瓦签订的停战协定。最近美国总统艾森豪威尔任命柯林斯为美国驻南越特使，他的主要任务就是执行侵略性的东南亚条约，加紧建立傀儡军队，并帮助吴庭艳加强他的地位，柯林斯是一个曾参预朝鲜侵略战争的美国将军。
    评论接着叙述美国一系列的干涉印度支那的行为说：美帝国主义者把法国殖民主义者拖进侵略性的东南亚集团，并把柬埔寨、老挝和南越划入这个集团的所谓保护地区内。在最近的华盛顿会议上，美帝国主义者强迫法国统治集团让他们在军事、政治和经济方面直接援助印度支那的联邦成员国，换言之，就是让美帝国主义者直接控制吴庭艳集团并控制柬埔寨和老挝。美帝国主义者帮助法国殖民主义者强迫若干住在北越的越南人移往南部，并企图阻碍越南通过自由普选实现统一。
    评论又说：目前，南越傀儡中间尖锐的矛盾，是法美帝国主义者之间的矛盾所引起的。越来越腐败的吴庭艳集团为越南人民深恶痛绝，而美帝国主义者仍然把这个卖国贼维持在南越的保大政府里，因为他是他们的忠实奴仆。
    评论指出：任命柯林斯一事表明，美帝国主义者正在更加无耻地干涉印度支那国家的事务，并威胁东南亚的和平。然而，这也证明了美帝国主义者正遭遇到由于人民对他们和吴庭艳集团的强烈反对而引起的许多困难。法国殖民主义者和美帝国主义者之间的矛盾，由于美帝国主义者越来越深地干涉南越、老挝和柬埔寨而越来越尖锐了。
    评论最后说：越南人民将更加提高警惕。他们有决心粉碎美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民主义分子和他们的仆从吴庭艳匪帮的阴谋，并为促使法国政府认真执行日内瓦协定而斗争。
