Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York: At a plenary meeting held on the 4th, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, without discussion or voting, the recommendations of the General Committee to include two items proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda. These two items are: "Complaint regarding the acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the United State Navy for these acts" and "Complaint regarding the violation of freedom of navigation in the seas off China."

The plenary meeting then unanimously adopted, after discussion, a resolution proposed by Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

The plenary meeting then examined the report of the Political Committee on the issue of "collective measures" and adopted, by a majority vote, a resolution stipulating that the Collective Measures Committee should continue its activities. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it, while India and Indonesia abstained.

The plenary meeting also adopted the report and draft resolution of the Special Political Committee on the treatment of people of Indian origin in the Union of South Africa. The adopted resolution expressed the hope that the governments of India, Pakistan, and the Union of South Africa would resolve this issue through direct negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 6th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of "international cooperation in the development of peaceful uses of atomic energy" on the 5th.

The United States representative, Lodge, made a lengthy speech at the meeting. He described the United States' proposal for establishing a so-called international atomic energy agency. Lodge said that the United States government had been negotiating with the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Belgium, the Union of South Africa, and Portugal on the establishment of such an agency.

Lodge said that the plan proposed by the United States delegation stipulated that an international conference should be held in the spring of 1955 to discuss the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to exchange atomic energy information.

A large part of Lodge's speech talked about the possibilities of using atomic energy in various economic sectors, healthcare, and other aspects.

After Lodge's speech, the representatives of the United Kingdom and Canada spoke. The United Kingdom representative, Dixon, spoke in support of the United States' plan, while also pointing out that without the participation of the Soviet Union, the goal of widely using atomic energy for peaceful purposes could not be fully realized.

It is worth noting that none of the speakers mentioned that prohibiting the use of atomic energy as a weapon of mass destruction is the most important task.

    政委会开始讨论原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会在四日举行的全体会议上未经讨论、未经投票就通过了总务委员会的建议，把苏联提出的两个项目列入议程。这两个项目是：“关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任的控诉”和“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的控诉”。
    全体会议接着在讨论后一致通过了加拿大、法国、苏联、英国和美国提出的关于裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决议。
    全体会议然后研究了政治委员会提出的关于“集体措施”问题的报告，并以多数票通过了规定集体措施委员会继续进行活动的决议。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克投票反对，印度和印度尼西亚弃权。
    全体会议并通过了特别政治委员会关于南非联邦境内印度人待遇问题的报告和决议草案。通过的决议表示希望印度、巴基斯坦和南非联邦政府通过直接谈判来解决这个问题。
      【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社纽约六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在五日开始讨论“在发展原子能的和平用途方面的国际合作”问题。
    美国代表洛奇在会上作了长篇的发言。他叙述了美国的关于建立所谓国际原子能机构的建议。洛奇说，美国政府已经同英国、法国、加拿大、澳大利亚、比利时、南非联邦和葡萄牙的政府就建立这种机构的问题进行了谈判。
    洛奇说，美国代表团所提出的计划规定在一九五五年春举行国际会议，以便讨论原子能用于和平目的的问题，并交换原子能情报。
    洛奇的发言中很大一部分谈到把原子能用于经济各部门、保健以及其他各方面的可能性。
    洛奇发言后，英国和加拿大的代表发言。英国代表狄克逊发言支持美国的计划，他同时指出，没有苏联的参加，就不能充分地实现把原子能广泛用于和平用途的目的。
    值得注意的是：任何一个发言人都没有谈到，禁止把原子能用作大规模毁灭性武器是最重要的一个任务。
