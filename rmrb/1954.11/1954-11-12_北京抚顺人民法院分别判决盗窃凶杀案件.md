The Beijing People's Court and the Fushun People's Court recently separately sentenced two cases of theft and homicide. Murderers Liu Sen and Wu Wenkai were sentenced to death and executed immediately.

The murderer Liu Sen, executed in Beijing, had previously participated in the Kuomintang reactionary army. In January 1953, he infiltrated the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory (now the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory) as a blacksmith. He often feigned illness to disrupt labor discipline and stole from the dormitories when workers were at work or out on holidays.

At around 7:00 AM on June 9th this year, Chen Yuqing, a worker and Youth League member at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, returned to the dormitory after studying and saw Liu Sen stealing workers' cloth inside. Chen Yuqing immediately grabbed him and tried to take him to the factory's security department to confess. The thief not only refused to confess but also attacked Chen Yuqing. During the struggle, Liu struck Chen Yuqing's head with an iron kettle, causing him to fall unconscious. Liu then continued to smash Chen Yuqing's head with the iron kettle until the handle broke off. He then smashed him with a wooden stool, breaking two stools in the process. Chen Yuqing died on the spot.

After killing Chen Yuqing, Liu Sen engaged in many activities to eliminate evidence of his crime. However, with the active assistance of the staff and workers of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Beijing Public Security Bureau quickly cracked the murder case, recovered the murder weapon used by Liu, trousers stained with blood, and dozens of stolen items, including bicycles, clothing, watches, pens, Renminbi, and meal tickets. These were all handed over to the Beijing People's Court for sentencing. In the face of conclusive evidence, the thief and murderer Liu Sen had no choice but to confess to all his crimes.

On June 16th, all employees of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory held a meeting to solemnly mourn Chen Yuqing, the Youth League member who resolutely safeguarded revolutionary order and the interests of the people. The Youth League General Branch of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory announced a decision to commend Chen Yuqing at the meeting. The factory director of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, heads of the factory's Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations, and family members of the deceased spoke at the meeting. They called on all employees to raise their revolutionary vigilance, eliminate saboteurs hidden in the ranks of the working class, and resolutely fight against criminal behavior and all crimes that endanger production and disrupt revolutionary order. They unanimously demanded that the People's Court severely punish the murderer Liu Sen.

The Beijing People's Court sentenced the thief and murderer Liu Sen to death on August 31st. With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, he was executed by firing squad on October 6th.

The murderer Wu Wenkai, executed in Fushun, was an unemployed vagrant. He came to Fushun from Hebei Province in March this year and stayed at his aunt's house. His aunt's house was opposite the staff and workers' consumer cooperative of the Fushun Mining Bureau Timber Factory. He discovered that the cooperative's anti-espionage and anti-theft work was very lax, and the day's sales revenue was not turned in until the next day, so he deliberately planned to rob it. On the night of May 20th, while two female shop assistants, Zhao Caifeng and Zhou Yuzhi, were asleep on night duty in the non-staple food department of the cooperative, Wu dug open the corner of the eastern wall of the non-staple food department, sneaked into the room, and stole 8.3 million yuan in cash from a drawer. After the theft, he saw the two female shop assistants sleeping on the bunk and attempted to rape them. Zhao and Zhou woke up and shouted loudly, resisting. Wu then stabbed them to death with a sharp knife.

After this theft and murder case occurred, the Fushun Public Security Bureau and the People's Court and other agencies thoroughly examined the scene and conducted investigations. The murderer Wu Wenkai was captured on the same day. The Fushun People's Court held a public trial and sentenced Wu to death immediately, in accordance with the law. At the same time, relevant departments in Fushun expressed condolences and provided compensation to the families of the two murdered female shop assistants.

The non-staple food department of this cooperative was located in the center of a non-staple food retail market. The building was very weak. A piece of the cement plastering on the corner of the wall of the meat stall had fallen off, and the board underneath could be pried open. The windows were not painted and there were no curtains, so it was possible to see the cooperative counting the sales revenue and where it was placed from across the street. The door of the cooperative only had an upper bolt but no lower bolt, and a piece of glass on the door was broken. By stepping on a higher object, one could reach in and open the bolt. The cooperative's负责人(responsible person) rarely educated employees on protecting public property, and did not promptly supervise the repair of the building or establish and improve anti-espionage, anti-theft, and fire prevention systems. The sales revenue from the day of the theft was placed in a non-secure drawer. When inspecting this theft and murder case, relevant authorities in Fushun believed that the 负责人(responsible person) of the cooperative was ideologically numb and should bear some responsibility. Therefore, the Fushun Cooperative Union has given them a demerit.

    北京抚顺人民法院分别判决盗窃凶杀案件
    北京市人民法院和抚顺市人民法院在最近分别判决了两件盗窃、凶杀案件，杀人犯刘森和吴文凯被判处死刑立即执行。
    北京市处决的杀人犯刘森，过去参加过国民党反动军队，一九五三年一月，混入华北农业机械总厂（现在的北京农业机械厂）作锻工，经常装病破坏劳动纪律，并乘工人们上班或假日外出时在宿舍内进行偷窃。
    今年六月九日上午七点多钟，北京农业机械厂工人、青年团员陈玉清学习完毕回到宿舍时，看见刘森正在宿舍内偷窃工人的布匹，陈玉清当场抓住他，拉他到工厂保卫部门去认罪。这个盗窃犯不但拒不认罪，反而动手攻打陈玉清。在搏斗中，陈玉清被刘犯用铁壶砸伤头部，昏迷倒地。以后刘犯又继续用铁壶猛砸陈玉清的后脑，铁壶的提手被砸掉了，他又用木凳猛砸，两个凳子都砸坏了，陈玉清当即身死。
    刘森杀人以后，又进行了许多消灭罪证的活动，但是本市人民公安机关在北京农业机械厂职工群众的积极协助下，迅速破获了这件凶杀案，起出刘犯杀人时的凶器和染满血迹的裤子，以及他历次偷窃的自行车、衣服、手表、钢笔、人民币、饭票等数十件赃物，一并送交北京市人民法院判处。在确凿的证据面前，盗窃杀人犯刘森不得不供认了他的全部罪行。
    六月十六日，北京农业机械厂全体职工举行了大会，隆重追悼坚决维护革命秩序和人民利益的青年团员陈玉清，青年团北京农业机械厂总支委员会并在会上宣布了表扬陈玉清的决定。北京农业机械厂厂长和该厂党、团、工会组织的负责人及死者家属都在会上讲了话，他们号召全体职工提高革命警惕性，肃清隐藏在工人阶级队伍中的破坏分子，向犯罪行为和一切危害生产、破坏革命秩序的罪行进行坚决的斗争。他们一致要求人民法院严惩杀人犯刘森。
    北京市人民法院于八月三十一日判处盗窃杀人犯刘森死刑，并经最高人民法院批准，已在十月六日执行枪决。
    抚顺市处决的杀人凶犯吴文凯是一个无业游民，今年三月由河北省到抚顺市，寄居在他的姨母家里。他姨母家的房子正在抚顺市矿务局木材厂职工消费合作社的对门。他发现这个合作社的防特、防盗工作很松懈，当天的售货款要第二天才上缴，便蓄意行抢。五月二十日深夜，正当这个合作社副食部的两个女营业员赵彩凤和周玉芝值夜睡熟的时候，吴犯把副食部东边的房角挖开，钻入屋内，从抽屉里偷得现款八百三十万元。盗窃之后，他看见吊铺上睡着两个女营业员，就企图强奸。赵、周两人惊醒后大声喊叫，抵抗，吴犯就用尖刀把她们杀死了。
    这个盗窃、凶杀案件发生后，经过抚顺市公安局和人民法院等机关详细检验现场并进行侦查，当天就捕获了杀人犯吴文凯。抚顺市人民法院召开公审大会，依法将吴犯判处死刑立即执行。同时抚顺市有关部门对两个被害的女营业员的家属进行了慰问和抚恤。
    这个合作社的副食部设在一个副食品零售市场的中心，房子很不坚固，卖肉处的墙脚上抹的水泥掉了一块，底下的板子能够撬开，窗子没有涂颜色，也没有窗帘遮蔽，在街对面就能看清合作社清点货款和货款放置的地方。而合作社的门又只有上插闩，没有下插闩，门上的玻璃破了一块，只要踏着一个较高的东西就能用手拨开门闩，进入屋内。合作社的负责人平日很少对职工进行保卫公共财产的教育，也没有及时督促修补房屋，建立和健全防特、防盗和防火等制度，失盗当天的售货款就放在一个不坚固的抽屉里面。抚顺市有关机关在检查这个盗窃、凶杀案件时，认为这个合作社的负责人思想麻痹，应负一定的责任，因此已由抚顺市合作社联合社给予记过处分。
