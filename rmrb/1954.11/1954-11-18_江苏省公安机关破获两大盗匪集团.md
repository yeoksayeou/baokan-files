The Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Organs, with the close cooperation of the Shanghai and Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Departments, and relying on the broad masses of the people, after careful investigation and pursuit, completely cracked down on the "Water and Fire Gang" and "Poor River Travellers" two major bandit groups, who have disturbed the public order in urban and rural areas along Taihu Lake, the Yangtze River, and the Longhai Railway for decades, committing numerous crimes. Fifty-one bandits, including the ringleaders Zhang A'gen, Xu Wenbin, Wang Qibao, Gu Zonghua, Ji A'san, Pan Jinsheng, and Fan Hongsheng, have all been captured, and the remaining bandits are being pursued and brought to justice one by one. These two bandit groups committed a total of 3,048 cases before and after liberation, of which 14 murder for money cases have been verified. Major theft and robbery cases in more than 60 cities and counties along Taihu Lake, the Yangtze River, and the Longhai Railway were mostly committed by these bandits. At the same time, the authorities also uncovered the remaining members of the special agent bandit organization "China Loyal and Righteous Pacification Army Jiangsu Zhejiang Anhui Hubei Command Headquarters Direct Second Regiment," which had infiltrated these bandit groups and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities using its organization, as well as a number of fugitive landlords and local bullies. Six long and short guns, 165 bullets, 22 forged seals, stamps, and chops of the People's Government and mass organizations, and some forged documents were seized. In addition, some stolen goods and money worth approximately 160 million yuan were recovered. According to statistics from ten counties, after the "Water and Fire Gang" and "Poor River Travellers" two major bandit groups were cracked down, criminal cases in these areas decreased significantly, and social order became more consolidated.

The "Water and Fire Gang" and "Poor River Travellers" were two bandit groups that had been active for a long time and were large in scale, causing profound disasters to the broad masses of the people for decades. Most of the members of these two bandit groups were habitual bandits, habitual thieves, hooligans, and unemployed vagrants. They had a set of barbarous and cruel gang rules and trade rules and other feudal rule methods. Before liberation, the bandit leaders colluded with the Japanese invaders, puppet troops, the reactionary officials and secret service agencies of the Chiang bandits, and the evil landlords, so they dared to commit crimes wantonly. For example, the "Water and Fire Gang" leaders Zhu Wenxiao, Li Jincheng, Wang Qibao, etc., had all accepted appointments from the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits; Li Zhigang, the county magistrate of Danyang under the Chiang bandits, was the backstage supporter of Li Jincheng, the leader of the "Water and Fire Gang." Therefore, there was a saying circulating among the masses: "The Taihu bandits cannot be completely wiped out." After liberation, through the suppression of bandits and the elimination of local bullies, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and various social reforms, the bandit gangs mainly engaged in robbery in the two bandit groups suffered heavy blows; some coerced followers were allocated land in the land reform, have reformed and engaged in production; but some bandit elements adopted decentralized and concealed activities, changed robbery to theft, and dispersed to commit crimes. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries movement, bandit elements took advantage of certain gaps in our work and gradually gathered again. Their methods of activity became more cunning than before, such as using the professions of juggling, collecting old goods, fishing, and repairing bowls as cover, adopting mobile methods of committing crimes in different places and selling stolen goods in different places, establishing fixed liaison points and places for selling stolen goods in towns, land and water terminals in the areas of activity, or colluding with some speculative merchants to provide them with cover and harbour stolen goods, in an attempt to escape government punishment. Due to the participation of some counter-revolutionary elements who had escaped the net, fugitive landlords, and evil bullies after the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries movement, the activities of these two bandit groups were not only theft and fraud, but also privately engraving seals and certificates, fabricating reactionary rumors, robbing the guns of individual cadres and the People's Liberation Army, impersonating military and government personnel to rob and extort, and even attempting to destroy railway traffic and organize reactionary armed forces.

From the facts that have been verified, it can be seen that the activities of the bandits seriously endangered the country's socialist construction cause and the vital interests of the broad masses of the people. The verified cases of theft by the "Water and Fire Gang" and "Poor River Travellers" from state-owned companies, cooperatives, and institutions alone numbered 394; the "Water and Fire Gang" members Zhu Sanxiong and Wang Nangui, captured in Wuxi City alone, stole property worth more than 610 million yuan from state-owned companies and cooperatives. The activities of the bandits also endangered the safety of life and property of the broad masses of the people. According to the confession of Zhang Youhulu, the leader of the "Poor River Travellers," he stole so many chickens in 1951 and 1952 that even two rooms could not hold them all. Xu Niuzi, a member of the "Water and Fire Gang," confessed that he stole more than 20,000 chickens after liberation. As for stealing crops, clothes, and copperware, it is impossible to count. More serious is murder for money: Wang Yuchao, Zhong Yinyao and other leaders of the "Water and Fire Gang" robbed ships on a river in Kongyu Temple, Jiading County, and threw Qian Zhenkun and others into the river to drown them, and even an infant only a few months old on the ship was brutally murdered by the bandits.

However, the People's Government and the people have the power to completely eliminate this batch of bandit elements. In the process of investigating and pursuing the bandits, the people's public security organs received the active support and assistance of the broad masses of the people. When the bandit leaders Wang Qibao and Xu Wenbin went to a tea house in Xiaoximen, Kunshan, they were discovered by Lu Buqing, a member of the local public security committee, who reported it to the police station. After verification, they were arrested according to law. Zhang Mingyou, a resident of Suzhou, discovered bandit elements while going out and immediately made a long-distance phone call to ask the public security organs to pursue them. A hotel employee in Xuzhou Prefecture and a porter in Shanghai took the initiative to assist the government in arresting fugitive bandits after discovering them. The broad masses of boatmen and fishermen along the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake also actively guided the public security personnel when the public security organs were pursuing the bandits, thus enabling the bandits of various gangs to be quickly captured by us.

Currently, thirteen bandits, including the ringleaders Xu Wenbin, Wang Qibao, and Gu Zonghua, have been sentenced to death by the people's courts; habitual criminals Wang Yuncheng, Gao Xiaomei, etc., have been sentenced to life imprisonment; and the remaining criminals have also been dealt with according to law, depending on the severity of their crimes.

    江苏省公安机关破获两大盗匪集团
    江苏省公安机关在上海市和浙江省公安部门的密切配合下，依靠广大群众，经过严密的侦查追剿，将几十年来在太湖、长江沿岸和陇海铁路沿线扰乱城乡治安、作案累累的“水火帮”和“穷江行”两大盗匪集团全部破获，匪首张阿根、徐文彬、王其宝、顾宗华、吉阿三、潘金生、范洪生等五十一名已全部就擒，其余匪徒也被一一追捕归案。这两股盗匪集团在解放前后共作案三千零四十八起，其中谋财害命的案件已查明有十四起，太湖、长江沿岸和陇海铁路沿线六十多个市、县发生的重大偷窃、抢劫案件，大部是这帮匪徒所为。同时又查获了渗入这帮盗匪集团利用其组织继续进行反革命活动的特务匪徒组织“中国忠义靖难军苏浙皖鄂指挥部直属第二团”的漏网分子及逃亡地主、恶霸多人，追缴出长短枪六支、子弹一百六十五发，伪造人民政府和群众团体的关防、条戳、钤记二十二颗，一部分伪造证件。并收缴出部分赃物赃款约值人民币一亿六千万元。根据十个县的统计，在破获了“水火帮”、“穷江行”两大盗匪集团以后，这些地方的刑事案件显著下降，社会治安更加巩固。
    “水火帮”、“穷江行”是两个作恶时间很长、组织庞大的盗匪集团，几十年来给广大人民制造了深重的灾难。这两个盗匪集团的成员多数是惯匪、惯窃、流氓和无业游民，内部有一套野蛮残暴的帮规、行规等封建统治办法。解放前匪首们同日寇伪军和蒋匪的反动官府、特务机关以及恶霸地主都有勾结，所以敢于肆无忌惮地犯罪作案。如“水火帮”头子朱文孝、黎锦城、王其宝等都接受过日寇、蒋匪的委任；蒋匪丹阳县长李志刚就是“水火帮”头子黎锦城的后台。因此，在群众中流传着
  “剿不清的太湖土匪”的谚语。解放后，经过剿匪反霸、镇压反革命运动和各项社会改革工作，两个盗匪集团中以抢劫为主的匪帮受到较重的打击；有一部分胁从分子在土地改革中分到田地，已改邪归正，从事生产；但一部分盗匪分子采取了分散隐蔽的活动方式，变抢为偷，分散作案。在镇压反革命运动以后，盗匪分子利用我们工作中的某些空隙又逐渐聚集起来，活动方式较前更加诡诈，如以玩杂耍、收旧货、捕鱼、补碗等职业作掩护，采取易地作案、易地销赃的流窜办法，在活动地区的城镇、水陆码头建立固定的联络点和销赃处所，或勾结一些投机商人为他们作掩护和窝藏赃物，企图逃避政府的惩罚。由于镇压反革命运动以后有一部分漏网反革命分子、逃亡地主、恶霸参加，这两个盗匪集团的活动不单是盗窃诈骗，而且私刻印信证件，制造反动谣言，劫夺单身干部和解放军的枪支，冒充军政人员抢劫敲诈，甚至企图毁坏铁路交通和组织反动武装。
    从已经查明的事实可以看出，盗匪们的活动严重危害了国家的社会主义建设事业和广大群众的切身利益。单我国营公司、合作社、机关查明的被“水火帮”、“穷江行”盗窃的案件就有三百九十四起；仅无锡市捕获的朱三甥、王南桂等“水火帮”分子，就盗窃了国营公司、合作社价值六亿一千多万元的财物。盗匪们的活动还危害了广大人民生命财产的安全。据“穷江行”匪首张油葫芦供认，他在一九五一、一九五二的两年中，单是偷的鸡就连两间屋也放不下。“水火帮”分子徐牛子自供解放后偷的鸡就有两万多只。至于偷割庄稼、偷衣服、偷铜器等，更是无法统计了。更严重的是谋财害命：“水火帮”头子王玉朝、仲银尧等在嘉定县孔玉庙的一条河上抢劫船只，竟把钱振坤等四人抛到河里淹死，连船上一个刚出生几个月的婴儿，也被匪徒们惨害了。
    但是，人民政府和人民完全有力量彻底肃清这批盗匪分子。人民公安机关在侦查和追捕匪徒们的过程中，得到了广大群众的积极支持和协助，匪首王其宝、徐文彬等到昆山小西门去喝茶时，被该地治安保卫委员陆步清发现，报告了派出所，经查对属实后依法将他们捕获。苏州市居民张明友外出发现盗匪分子，就立即打长途电话请公安机关追捕。徐州专区一客栈职工和上海市一搬运工人发现漏网逃匿的盗匪分子后，主动地协助政府缉捕，长江、太湖沿岸的广大船民、渔民，在公安机关追捕匪徒时，也都积极地为公安人员带路，因而使各帮匪徒迅速地被我捕获。
    现匪首徐文彬、王其宝、顾宗华等十三名已由人民法院判处死刑；惯犯王云成、高小妹等已被判处无期徒刑；其余罪犯也已分别情节轻重，依法作了处理。
