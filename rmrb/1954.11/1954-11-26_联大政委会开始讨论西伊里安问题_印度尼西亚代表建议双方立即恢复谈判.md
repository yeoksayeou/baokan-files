Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 25th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd to begin discussing the West Irian (Western New Guinea) issue.

    In the debate, Indonesian representative Sudjarwo spoke first. He recounted that the Netherlands had previously agreed to the principle that all territories of the former Dutch East Indies should become part of the Republic of Indonesia. He went on to say that at the Round Table Conference in 1949, Indonesia had to agree to Dutch temporary administration of West Irian on the condition that the status of West Irian be resolved through negotiations later. However, the Netherlands restored the colonial system in West Irian and refused to negotiate on the status of the region. Therefore, Indonesia decided to bring the West Irian issue to the United Nations.

    Sudjarwo said that the activities of the Dutch authorities "have plunged the people of West Irian into hardship and a near hopeless situation." The Dutch colonial authorities are building barracks in West Irian that far outnumber schools. They are building naval bases under the pretext of "defending" the region.

    Sudjarwo finally put forward a proposal suggesting that both sides immediately resume negotiations on the political status of West Irian in order to peacefully resolve the issue. The proposal also stipulated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations submit a report on the outcome of the negotiations to the tenth session of the General Assembly.

    Dutch representative van Balluseck then spoke, attempting to defend his government's attitude on the West Irian issue, claiming that Indonesia's attitude made the resumption of negotiations on the West Irian issue "impractical and impossible."

    联大政委会开始讨论西伊里安问题
    印度尼西亚代表建议双方立即恢复谈判
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十三日下午举行会议，开始讨论西伊里安（新畿内亚西部）问题。
    印度尼西亚代表苏加沃在辩论中首先发言。他追述说，荷兰以前曾经同意一个原则，就是：前荷属东印度的全部领土应当成为印度尼西亚共和国的组成部分。他接着说，在一九四九年的圆桌会议上，印度尼西亚曾经不得不以西伊里安的地位问题以后用谈判来解决为条件，同意荷兰临时管理西伊里安。可是，荷兰在西伊里安恢复了殖民制度并且拒绝就这个地区的地位问题进行谈判。因此，印度尼西亚便决定把西伊里安问题提到联合国来。
    苏加沃说，荷兰当局的活动“已经使西伊里安人民陷于困苦和几乎没有希望的处境”。荷兰殖民当局在西伊里安建立着数目远远超过学校的兵营。他们正在以“保卫”这个地区为借口建立海军基地。
    苏加沃最后提出一项提案，建议双方立即恢复关于西伊里安政治地位的谈判，以便和平解决这个问题。这个提案中还规定：联合国秘书长向大会第十届会议提出关于谈判结果的报告。
    荷兰代表巴鲁塞克接着发言，他企图为他的政府在西伊里安问题上所采取的态度辩解，他说什么印度尼西亚的态度使恢复关于西伊里安问题的谈判成为“不实际的和不可能的”。
