Shijingshan District Government Strengthens Service to Industrial Production
Shang Zuowei
Shijingshan District, Beijing, is located between the Jingxi Mining Area and the Haidian and Fengtai Districts, and is divided into one town and thirteen townships. The district has a total of 17,102 households and 69,280 people, with the majority being industrial workers. The main factories are the state-owned Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the power plant, and the local state-owned brick factory. In addition, there is some agriculture and private industry and commerce. The socialist economic component occupies an absolute advantage. In 1953, the total output value of the state-owned iron and steel, power generation, and brick factories accounted for 97.6% of the total output value of the district; the output value of private industry accounted for 1% of the total output value of the district; and the output value of agriculture accounted for 1.4% of the total output value of the district. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce also accounted for a large proportion of commodity trade. In 1953, the total sales of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for 60.7% of the total commercial sales in the district, while the total sales of private commerce accounted for 39.3%. Cultural and educational undertakings are also relatively developed. There is one middle school, twenty-three primary schools, and twenty-six spare-time schools in the district. There are 820 middle school students, of which more than 65% are children of workers and staff; there are 5,851 primary school students, accounting for 89.6% of the school-age children in the district, of which more than 60% are children of workers and staff; and there are 7,970 students in spare-time schools, including 6,714 workers and staff, accounting for more than 84% of the total number of students.

The Shijingshan District government, although it has done some work to restore and develop industrial production in recent years, still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial construction and development, and there are more or less problems in both the administrative policy and various specific tasks. Factory personnel do not pay enough attention to and rely on the district government. Even a situation has occurred in which each goes its own way and is not related to each other. These problems have been gradually resolved since this spring, and work has been improved.

First of all, there is a change in the composition of the government organization. Pure worker households account for about one-half of Shijingshan District, while pure farmer households account for only one-tenth (semi-worker and farmer households are not included). However, in the past, none of the 113 representatives of the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in the district were representatives of factory workers and staff; in the second session of the People's Representatives Conference, only 12 representatives of state-owned factory workers and their families accounted for 11.4% of the total number of representatives, while as many as 64 farmer representatives accounted for 61% of the total number of representatives. Among the 13 members of the District People's Government Committee, there were only two workers and their families, while there were four farmers. The district government organization is not adapted to the class situation in the district. After the general election, this situation has changed. Among the 85 representatives of the first People's Congress, there were 35 state-owned factory workers and their families, accounting for 41% of the total number of representatives, plus the staff of the District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the government, cultural, educational, and medical workers, and transport workers, accounting for 60.3% of the total number of representatives; 23 farmers accounted for 27% of the total number of representatives; and other classes also had a certain number of representatives. This basically fits the characteristics of the Shijingshan industrial area.

In the past, the Shijingshan District government did a very poor job in serving industrial production. Since March 1951, Shijingshan District has convened seven sessions of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles, discussing and resolving 20 major issues in the district; the Consultative Committee has held six meetings, discussing 21 major issues; the Government Committee has held twelve meetings, except for the sixth, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth meetings, which were held jointly with the Consultative Committee, the remaining seven meetings discussed a total of 14 major issues. The People's Representatives Conference of all circles in the district, the Consultative Committee, and the Government Committee have discussed and resolved a total of 55 major issues in the district, of which the most were related to agricultural production, while fewer were directly related to factories and enterprises. At the first meeting of the first People's Congress of Shijingshan District held in June this year, the issue of serving industrial production was emphasized, and it was made clear that in the future, serving industrial production should be the main focus, and agriculture and other work should be done accordingly. Due to the change in administrative policy, many other tasks have also been improved.

In the past, the District People's Government had very little control over the work of the residential areas of workers and staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the power plant. Both the residential areas of the workers and staff of the iron and steel plant and the power plant have family committees. The family committee of the iron and steel plant is under the leadership of the women workers' department of the plant's trade union; the family committee of the power plant is under the leadership of the plant's trade union. The work of the residential areas of workers and staff is mostly handled by the family committees. Because the family committees' management and education of the workers' and staff's families is poor, disputes often occur between neighbors, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and couples, which affects both the unity among the workers and staff and hinders production. In order to strengthen the leadership of the work in the workers' residential areas and streets, the District People's Government has now established four offices in the residential areas of workers and staff such as Beixin'an Town, Pingguoyuan, and Guangningfen in order to improve the work.

In the past, the political education and material preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the power plant were mainly handled by the factories; the District People's Government generally did not intervene in social relief work. Now the District People's Government has strengthened the work of preferential treatment and social relief for the workers and staff and their families in the two plants. The civil affairs section of the District People's Government uniformly manages the work of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers among the workers and staff and their families according to the general families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and carries out political education and preferential treatment. The original political treatment of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the factory is still retained. The material subsidies for the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers among the workers and staff and their families are solved by the District People's Government according to the urban subsidy standards. If some workers' and staff's families have difficulties in life, the factory has already provided subsidies according to various subsidy methods within the factory, but if the living standards are still lower than the minimum living standards of ordinary citizens, the District People's Government will solve the problem according to the urban social relief standards.

The iron and steel and power plants each run a primary school with a total of more than 2,000 students. In the past, the administration of the schools was not under the leadership of the District People's Government, and the District People's Government rarely provided guidance in terms of business. The administrative departments of the factories led the schools, but did not understand the business. In order to strengthen the leadership of teaching and reduce the burden on the factories, the administration and business of the primary schools for the children of workers and staff in the two plants have been taken over by the District People's Government, but they are still the primary schools for the children of workers and staff run by the factories themselves.

The cultural and educational section of the District People's Government has actively solved the problem of literacy education for the workers' and staff's families in the workers' residential areas of the iron and steel plant according to the urban "people teaching people, masses running themselves" policy.

In the past, the environmental sanitation and garbage removal in the workers' residential areas of the iron and steel plant were all the responsibility of the factory, which was a heavy burden. Now, the environmental sanitation within the two plants is still the responsibility of the factory, while the environmental sanitation and garbage removal in the residential areas outside the factory are the responsibility of the District People's Government. The cadres, workers, and equipment originally responsible for this work in the iron and steel plant have been transferred to the District People's Government for management. In the past, there were few sanitation workers in the residential area of the power plant's families (Guangningfen), and they could not take care of it. There was no sanitation team organization in Beixin'an Town; now 21 sanitation workers and 21 garbage trucks have been set up in Guangningfen and Beixin'an Town to remove the long-accumulated garbage. This has strengthened environmental sanitation and is conducive to the health of workers, staff, and residents.

Workers who rent houses account for more than 80% of the total number of tenants in the district. Some landlords have raised rents. The phenomenon of collecting rent in advance is also very serious, and some even collect rent for one year in advance. Some landlords rent out dangerous houses and do not care about repairs, threatening the safety of workers and their families and directly affecting the workers' production mood. In order to solve this unreasonable phenomenon, the District People's Government has now carried out rent adjustment work in one town and four townships including Beixin'an and Gucheng, limiting the unreasonable phenomenon of collecting rent in advance, and mobilizing landlords to repair 104 houses. This work will continue to be carried out throughout the district. This will reduce the economic burden on workers and make rents fair and reasonable.

Public security and judicial work has also been further strengthened. In the past, the public security sub-bureau, the district court, and the factory security departments did not cooperate closely in their work, which created opportunities for bad elements to take advantage of, which affected both social order and production. With the transformation of various tasks, public security work has also been improved. In June, a number of thieves and hooligans were dealt with at mass meetings held in Guangningfen and Jindingjie, and the masses were educated on theft prevention and law-abiding, which had good results. The public security organs have also strengthened traffic management. The iron and steel plant also stipulates that workers are not allowed to enter or leave the factory at night if they do not turn on the lights when riding bicycles.

The adjustment of the members of the district government organization and the results of the improvement of various tasks have reduced the burden on the factories, enabled the factories to concentrate on leading production, and also solved the problems that the masses, especially the workers and staff and their families, urgently demanded to be solved, thus winning the warm support of the broad masses of workers and staff in the factories. Although the factory party and government responsible cadres elected as representatives of the first district people's congress are very busy, they always insisted on attending the meeting during the people's congress meeting. Some representatives said: "In the past, the district government did not serve industrial production enough, but this time it is different." Yang Kui, a people's representative and worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: "When I was elected as a people's representative of the district, the voters raised the issue of repairing the road, but before I could reflect it, the District People's Government put it forward in the work points for the second half of the year. Only the Communist Party and the People's Government can represent the interests of us workers." Xu Shufang, deputy director of the women workers' department of the iron and steel plant and representative, said: "In the future, the establishment of district people's government offices in the workers' and staff's family areas will enable us to regularly educate the families on policies and laws, which is of great benefit to factory production." The District People's Government received strong support from the factories, workers, and their families when carrying out various tasks. The Shijingshan Power Plant instructed the general affairs section to help the District People's Government office solve problems such as housing and food. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant vacated houses for the District People's Government office, and the family committees also took the initiative to introduce the situation. On the day the sanitation team started work, the workers' and staff's families in Guangningfen prepared tea and water to entertain them, and rushed to help the sanitation team load the trucks. The sanitation committee also wrote a letter to the sanitation team to express their gratitude.

The improvement of the work of the Shijingshan District Government has also further strengthened the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, some workers sometimes went to the farmers' fields to pick corn and dig peanuts to eat, infringing on the interests of the farmers and causing dissatisfaction among the farmers. Since 1954, especially after the first meeting of the first district people's congress was held, the relationship between workers and peasants has been further strengthened. Farmers have planted a large number of cash crops, oil crops, and vegetables this year, and the vegetable area alone has increased by more than five times. The supply and marketing cooperative has also signed vegetable supply and marketing contracts with 16 agricultural production cooperatives and one mutual aid group to ensure the supply of workers, staff, and the masses. Liang Gui, director of the Bajiao Township Agricultural Production Cooperative and people's representative, said at the district people's congress meeting: "Our farmers must produce more grain, pay the public grain well, and mobilize the members to sell the surplus grain to the state, expand the area of oil crops and vegetables, and plant fruit trees to support industrial construction." Workers and staff have also actively helped farmers do a good job in production. For example, after the first meeting of the first district people's congress, when the farmers were harvesting wheat, more than 6,000 mu of land in various townships in the district suffered from insect pests. The iron and steel plant and the power plant mobilized more than 3,900 workers, staff, and their families to participate in insect catching, and finally eliminated the insect pests. The farmers said with emotion: "The worker comrades worked all day and helped us fight insects." The farmers in Baimiao Township also wrote a letter of thanks to the iron and steel plant's trade union. The workers and staff said: "The grain we eat is grown by our farmer brothers, and the worker-peasant alliance is a blood-and-sweat alliance!"

The improvement of the work of the Shijingshan District Government has changed all aspects of work in the district. On the basis of the achievements already obtained, the district will continue to strengthen public security, judicial, and procuratorial work, strengthen the publicity and implementation of policies and laws, and study how to expand the state-owned and cooperative commercial network to ensure the supply to workers and staff, etc. The further resolution of these problems will push the work of the government serving industrial production further forward.

    石景山区政权加强为工业生产服务
    尚作为
    北京市石景山区位于京西矿区、海淀、丰台三区之间，分为一镇十三乡。全区共有一万七千一百零二户，六万九千二百八十人，工业人口占多数。主要工厂有国营石景山钢铁厂、发电厂和地方国营制砖厂；此外还有一些农业和私营工商业。社会主义经济成份占绝对优势。一九五三年国营钢铁、发电和制砖三厂生产总值占全区生产总值的百分之九十七点六；私营工业产值占全区生产总值的百分之一；农业产值占全区生产总值的百分之一点四。国营商业和合作社商业在商品贸易中也占很大比重。一九五三年国营商业和合作社商业销货总额占全区商业销货总额的百分之六十点七，私营商业销货总额占百分之三九点三。文化教育事业也比较发达。全区有中学一所，小学二十三所，业余学校二十六所。中学生八百二十人，职工子弟占百分之六十五以上；小学生五千八百五十一人，占全区学龄儿童百分之八十九点六，职工子弟占百分之六十以上；业余学校的学员七千九百七十人，其中有职工六千七百一十四人，占学员总数的百分之八十四以上。
    石景山区的政权机构，几年来虽然为恢复和发展工业生产做了一些工作，但仍赶不上工业建设发展的需要，从施政方针到各种具体工作都或多或少的存在着问题。工厂人员对区政权的重视和依靠也不够。甚至发生各行其是、互不相关的情况。这些问题，自今春以来已逐渐得到解决，工作有了改进。
    首先是政权组织成份的变化。石景山区纯工户约占二分之一，纯农户只占十分之一（半工、农户未计算在内）。但过去第一届区各界人民代表会议的一百一十三名代表中没有一个工厂职工的代表；第二届人民代表会议一百零五名代表中，国营工厂职工及其家属代表仅有十二人，占代表总数的百分之十一点四，而农民代表竟有六十四人，占代表总数的百分之六十一。区人民政府委员会的十三名委员中，职工及其家属只有二人，而农民有四人。区政权组织和该区阶级情况不相适应。普选后，这种情况有了改变。第一届人民代表大会八十五名代表中，国营工厂职工和家属共有三十五名，占代表总数的百分之四十一，加上中共区委、政府的工作人员、文教、医务工作者和运输劳动者，共占代表总数的百分之六十点三；农民二十三名，占代表总数的百分之二十七；其他阶层也有其一定数量的人作代表。这样便基本上适合了石景山工业区的特点。
    过去，石景山区政权为工业生产服务方面作得很差。石景山区自一九五一年三月以来先后召开各界人民代表会议七次，讨论决议全区重大问题二十件；协商委员会开会六次，讨论重大问题二十一件；政府委员会开会十二次，除第六、第八、第九、第十一、第十二等五次是和协商委员会合并召开之外，其余七次共讨论重大问题十四件。区各界人民代表会议、协商委员会、政府委员会共讨论和决议了全区重大问题五十五件，其中有关农业生产的问题为最多，而直接有关工厂企业方面的问题则较少。今年六月份召开的石景山区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，着重讨论了为工业生产服务的问题，明确了今后要以为工业生产服务为主，相应作好农业及其他工作。由于施政方针的转变，其他许多工作也都有了改进。
    石景山钢铁厂及发电厂职工家属住宅区的工作，过去区人民政府管得很少。钢铁厂和发电厂的职工家属住宅区均设有家属委员会。钢铁厂的家属委员会属该厂工会女工部领导；发电厂的家属委员会属该厂工会领导。职工家属住宅区的工作多由家属委员会负责办理。因为家属委员会对职工家属的管理教育较差，邻居婆媳和夫妇之间经常闹纠纷，既影响职工之间的团结，也妨碍生产。为了加强职工住宅区和街道工作的领导，现在区人民政府已分别在北辛安镇、苹果园、广宁坟等职工家属住宅区建立了四个办事处，以求改进工作。
    石景山钢铁厂、发电厂的烈属、军属的政治教育和实物优待，以往主要是由工厂办理；社会救济工作，区人民政府一般也不过问。现在区人民政府已加强了对两厂职工和家属中的优抚工作和社会救济工作。两厂职工家属中烈属、军属工作，区人民政府民政科按一般烈属、军属统一管理，进行政治教育和优待。烈属、军属在工厂原有的政治待遇仍然保留。职工家属中的贫苦烈属、军属的实物补助，则由区人民政府按城市补助标准加以解决。有些职工家属生活困难，工厂已按厂内各种补助办法加以补助，但如生活水平仍低于一般市民最低生活水平，区人民政府就按城市社会救济标准加以解决。
    钢铁、发电两厂各办小学一所，学生共二千多人，过去学校的行政不属区人民政府领导，业务方面，区人民政府也很少指导。工厂行政部门领导学校，但不懂业务。为了加强教学的领导和减轻工厂负担，两厂职工子弟小学的行政和业务均已由区人民政府代管，但仍为工厂自办的职工子弟小学。
    钢铁厂、发电厂工人住宅区中的职工家属的识字教育，区人民政府文教科已按城区组织市民“以民教民、群众自办”的方针积极解决。
    钢铁厂职工住宅区的环境卫生、垃圾运除，过去都由工厂负责，负担很重。现在两厂厂内环境卫生仍由厂方负责，厂外家属住宅区环境卫生、垃圾运除，改由区人民政府负责。原钢铁厂负责这项工作的干部、工人，以及设备等，都移交区人民政府代为管理。过去，发电厂家属住宅区（广宁坟）清洁工人少，照顾不过来，北辛安镇没有清洁队的组织；现在广宁坟和北辛安镇已设立了清洁队员二十一人，垃圾车二十一辆，清除了积存已久的垃圾。这就加强了环境卫生，有利于职工和居民的身体健康。
    全区租房住的工人占房客总数的百分之八十以上。有的房主抬高房租。预收房租现象也相当严重，甚至有的预收一年房租。有的房主出赁危险房屋，不管修缮，威胁工人及其家属的安全，直接影响了工人的生产情绪。为了解决这种不合理的现象，区人民政府现已在北辛安、古城等一镇四乡进行了房租调整工作，限制了预收租金的不合理现象，并动员房主修缮了房屋一百零四间。这项工作并将继续在全区范围内进行。这样就减轻了工人的经济负担，使房租初步达到公平合理。
    公安、司法工作也进一步加强。过去，公安分局、区法院和工厂保卫部门在工作上配合不够密切，给坏分子造成可乘之机，既影响社会秩序又影响生产。随着各项工作的转变，公安工作也有了改进。六月份，在广宁坟、金顶街召开的群众大会上，处理了一批盗窃分子、流氓分子，对群众进行了防盗和守法教育，收效很好。公安机关同时加强了交通管理。钢铁厂也规定职工在夜间骑自行车不点灯一律不准出入工厂。
    区政权组织成员的调整和各项工作的改进的结果，减轻了工厂的负担，使工厂能够集中精力领导生产，同时也解决了群众特别是职工及其家属迫切要求解决的问题，因而获得了工厂广大职工群众的热烈拥护。当选为第一届区人民代表大会代表的工厂党、政负责干部虽然工作很忙，在人民代表大会会议期间，始终坚持出席会议。有的代表说：“过去区政府为工业生产服务不够，这回可不同了。”人民代表、石景山钢铁厂工人杨奎说：“当我被选为区人民代表时，选民就提出修马路的问题，可是没等我反映，区人民政府就在下半年工作要点中提出来了。只有共产党和人民政府才能代表我们工人的利益。”钢铁厂女工部副部长许淑芳代表说：“今后在职工家属区成立区人民政府办事处，就能经常向家属进行政策、法令的教育，这对工厂生产有很大好处。”在区人民政府进行各项工作时，得到了工厂、职工和家属的大力支持。石景山发电厂指示总务科帮助区人民政府办事处解决住房、伙食等问题。石景山钢铁厂给区人民政府办事处腾房子，各家属委员会也主动介绍情况。在清洁队开始工作的那一天，广宁坟的职工家属预备茶水招待，并抢着替清洁队装车，卫生委员会还写信向清洁队表示感谢。
    石景山区政权工作的改进，也进一步加强了工农联盟。过去有些工人有时到农民地里搿玉米，挖花生吃，侵犯农民利益，引起农民不满。一九五四年以来，特别是首届区人民代表大会第一次会议召开以后，进一步密切了工农关系。农民今年大量种植了经济作物、油料作物和蔬菜，仅蔬菜面积即增加了五倍多。供销合作社并和十六个农业生产合作社、一个互助组订立了蔬菜供销合同，以保证职工和群众的供应。八角乡农业生产合作社主任、人民代表梁贵在区人民代表大会会议上说：“我们农民一定多打粮食，把公粮缴好，并动员社员把余粮卖给国家，扩大油料作物和蔬菜面积，栽种果树，支援工业建设。”职工们也积极帮助农民搞好生产。例如首届区人民代表大会第一次会议后，正值农民麦收，全区各乡有六千多亩土地发生虫灾，钢铁厂、发电厂发动了三千九百多名职工和家属参加捕虫，终于消灭了虫灾。农民感动地说：“工人同志们干了一天活还帮助我们打虫子。”白庙乡农民还给钢铁厂工会写了感谢信。工人则表示：“我们吃的粮食是农民兄弟种的，工农是血汗的联盟！”
    石景山区政权工作的改进，使全区各方面工作都发生了变化。在已经获得的成绩的基础上，该区将继续加强公安、司法、检察工作，加强政策、法律的宣传和贯彻，以及研究如何扩大国营和合作社商业网，保证对职工的供应等等。这些问题的进一步解决，就会把政权为工业生产服务的工作再向前推进一步。
