    Surveying Team Members in the Snowy Fields
    Huang Xianya
    In September and October, when people in southern China were still wearing light clothing, the northern border of our motherland was already covered in white snow.

    The newly built Yalin Railway in the Greater Khingan Range of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been open to traffic up to Genhe and is continuing to extend forward.

    The vanguard of the construction of this railway—hundreds of employees from the First Survey and Design Team of the Northeast Design Bureau—are conducting surveys in the Genhe to Dalagou and Yitulihe to Keyihe areas, braving heavy snow. In the mountain valleys where the cold wind howls, white snow pours down in gusts. The surveying team members stand tall, gripping the measuring instruments in their hands, and advance through the silent woods. They never think, "The weather is cold, we can't complete the task," but instead think, "How many kilometers can we survey today?"

    At the construction site, they eat pickled vegetables and salted fish, and live in snow tents. Their legs are their mode of transport during the day, and at night they work as desks to write. Each one is like a being made of iron, never feeling that this kind of life is hard. They also say, "For a happy tomorrow, what does a little hardship today matter!"

    In order to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, the surveying team members have displayed a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm. The third squad of the first geological team had to dig four holes. It was originally planned to take eight days, but they completed it in only three days, ahead of schedule. When worker Song Enfu was digging a pit, water came out from the bottom of the pit, and the shovel couldn't dig up. He scooped sand out by hand in the freezing ice water. Engineer Huang Shoutong used his brains, made many comparative plans, appropriately selected the location of the water source well, shortened the pipeline by one hundred and sixty-four meters, and saved the country 200 million yuan in engineering construction costs.

    雪地里的勘测队员们
    黄显亚
    九、十月里，在祖国的南方，人们还穿着单衣的时候，在祖国的北部边疆已是白雪满地了。
    在内蒙古自治区的大兴安岭新修的牙林线铁路已通车到根河，正继续向前伸延。
    修建这条铁路的先锋队——东北设计分局第一勘测设计总队数百名职工冒着大雪在根河至达拉沟，伊图里河至克一河地带进行勘测。在冷风呼呼的山峪里，白雪一阵阵的扑盖下来，勘测队员们挺起胸膛，紧紧的握住手里的测量仪器，在鸦雀无声的树林里前进。他们从没有想过“天气冷，完不成任务”，而想的是“今天能测多少公里”。
    在工地里，他们吃的是咸菜、咸鱼，住的是雪地帐篷。他们两条腿白天跑路，晚上并着当办公桌写字。一个个像铁打成的，从不感觉这样的生活算苦。他们还说：“为了幸福的明天，今天吃点苦算啥呢！”
    为了支援解放军解放台湾，勘测队员们发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热情。地质一分队三班挖四个孔，原计划要用八天，结果只用三天就提前完成了。工人宋恩福在挖坑时，坑底下出了水，铁锹挖不起来，他就在刺骨的冰水里用手往上捞沙子。工程师黄寿彤开动脑筋，多作比较方案，适当的选择了水源井位置，缩短管路一百六十四公尺，给国家节省工程建筑费用两亿元。
