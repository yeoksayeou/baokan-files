Anshan City Cooperatives Federation
    Reserves Large Quantities of Winter Vegetables for Employees
    The Anshan City Cooperatives Federation has prepared a large quantity of winter vegetables for the city's employees. This year, the city needs to reserve a total of 29.7 million jin of winter vegetables, an increase of more than 14% compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and vegetable farmers in the suburbs actively responded to the government's call and planned to expand the vegetable planting area. This winter, they can supply 11 million jin of stored vegetables. The Anshan City Cooperatives Federation has also purchased 6.3 million jin of vegetables from Tangshan and other places and signed a supply contract for 4.5 million jin of vegetables with Haicheng County, Liaoning Province. This year, the winter vegetable supply work in Anshan City has been fully guaranteed.
    This year, the Anshan City Cooperatives Federation has also strengthened the cold-proofing and insulation of vegetables to ensure that employees throughout the city can eat good vegetables in winter. At present, the city's cooperative system has renovated twelve greenhouses, built ten new greenhouses, and dug twenty-one earth cellars, which can regularly store more than 3 million jin of vegetables. In order to help suburban vegetable farmers do a good job in cold protection when delivering vegetables, the Anshan City Cooperatives Federation has made more than 500 cotton quilts for vegetable farmers to use on vegetable delivery vehicles. Some agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs are also preparing to expand the area of greenhouses. They plan to produce 600,000 jin of fresh vegetables such as kidney beans, cucumbers, and green peppers in winter to meet the needs of employees. (Report from our Anshan reporter station)

    鞍山市合作社联合社
    给职工储备大量冬季蔬菜
    鞍山市合作社联合社已经为全市职工准备了大批冬季食用的蔬菜。今年全市共需要储备二千九百七十万斤冬季食用的蔬菜，比去年增加百分之十四以上。郊区农业生产合作社、互助组和菜农们，积极响应政府的号召，有计划地扩大了蔬菜种植面积，今年冬季可以供应一千一百万斤窖菜。鞍山市合作社联合社还从唐山等地先后购进蔬菜六百三十万斤，并同辽宁省海城县签订了四百五十万斤蔬菜的供应合同。今年鞍山市冬季蔬菜供应工作已经有了充分的保证。
    今年鞍山市合作社联合社还加强了蔬菜防寒保暖工作，保证全市职工在冬季能吃到好菜。目前，全市合作社系统已经整修了十二个暖房，新建了十个暖房，挖了二十一个土窖，可经常储菜三百多万斤。为了帮助郊区菜农在送菜时作好防寒工作，鞍山市合作社联合社做了五百多床棉被，借给菜农在送菜车上使用。郊区一些农业生产合作社也准备扩大温室的面积，他们计划在冬季生产芸豆、黄瓜、青椒等鲜菜六十万斤，供应职工的需要。（本报鞍山记者站）
