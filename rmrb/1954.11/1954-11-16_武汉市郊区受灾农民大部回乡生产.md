Most of the affected farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan have returned to their hometowns and are actively engaged in production and disaster relief.

While the floodwaters were still rising, the Wuhan Municipal Production and Disaster Relief Office sent cadres or telegraphed to Hunan, Shandong, and other places to purchase a large amount of materials for repairing houses, preparing to supply the disaster victims with rebuilding their homes. When the disaster victims began to return home, these materials were distributed to various townships according to the severity of the disaster, with supply stations set up in each area to facilitate farmers' purchases. At the same time, in order to help the disaster victims rebuild their homes and restore production, the People's Bank successively issued more than 3.84 billion yuan in loans for water conservancy, seeds, and other purposes. For disaster victims with difficult living conditions, the government also issued house repair loans and housing material relief.

Many disaster victims were able to budget carefully, overcome difficulties, and avoid borrowing from the government as much as possible in the process of rebuilding their homes. Xu Shouxiang and Chen Siwei, disaster victims in Huiji District, whose houses collapsed, took the initiative to propose changing large houses to smaller ones and using waste materials to overcome difficulties. Chen Xianghui, a disaster victim, voluntarily changed three rooms to two rooms, reducing the amount of loans from the government. The newly established vegetable production cooperative in Moshui Township, Fucheng District, not only repaired houses according to the principle of "large to small, high to low," saving the entire cooperative more than 10 million yuan, but also helped nearby individual farmers and mutual aid groups repair their houses.

Now, the disaster victims who have returned home have actively engaged in production and disaster relief movements. Of the 2,790 mu of land in Fucheng District from which water has receded, most of it has been cultivated except for the land that has not dried out, and more than 1,200 mu has been planted. After the members of the newly established vegetable production cooperative moved back, they have formulated a production increase and conservation plan for the fourth quarter. Members engaged in sideline production have all participated in the dike repair project. In terms of agriculture, the members have converted 10 mu of dry land into vegetable gardens and planted a variety of vegetables.

### 武汉市郊区受灾农民大部回乡生产

    武汉市郊区受灾农民大部回乡生产
    武汉市郊区受灾农民大部分已回到家乡，并积极投入了生产救灾运动。
    当洪水还在上涨的时候，武汉市生产救灾办公室就派出干部或打电报到湖南、山东等地去采购大量修盖房子用的材料，准备供应灾民重建家园。在灾民开始回家的时候，又根据受灾轻重的情况，将这些材料按片设供应站或发到各乡，便利农民购买。同时，人民银行为了帮助灾民重建家园恢复生产，先后发放了水利、种子等贷款三十八亿四千多万元。对生活困难的灾民，政府还发给修屋贷款和房料救济。
    许多灾民在重建家园工作中，都能精打细算，克服困难，尽可能不向政府贷款。惠济区灾民徐寿香、陈四维的房子垮了，他们便主动提出把大房改小房，并利用废料来克服困难；灾民陈祥惠主动将三间房改为两间，少领政府的贷款。福城区墨水乡新建蔬菜生产合作社不但按“大改小、高改矮”的原则修复房子，使全社节省了一千多万元，还帮助附近的单干农民和互助组修好了房子。
    现在回家以后的灾民都已积极投入生产救灾运动。福城区水退出的二千七百九十亩土地，除没有干的以外，大部分都已耕过了，种下的已有一千二百亩以上。新建蔬菜生产合作社社员们搬回去以后，已订出了第四季度增产节约计划，进行副业生产的社员都已参加修堤工程，农业方面，社员们已将十亩旱地改为菜园，种上了多种多样的蔬菜。
