Beijing's basic construction units are actively preparing for winter construction. Preliminary statistics show that there are 56 construction sites in Beijing that will be under construction this winter, with a total construction area of over 500,000 square meters. This is the first large-scale winter construction in Beijing. Currently, all construction sites designated for winter work are equipped with full-time cadres and have drafted preliminary construction organization designs. Some construction sites, such as the Beijing Department Store and the Iron and Steel Institute, have also formulated winter construction progress plans, safety measures plans, operating procedures, and various responsibility systems. Some construction sites have also prepared advanced tools for winter construction, such as "inside scaffolding" and "Malytsev shovels." Many construction sites have also made preparations for cold protection, lighting, and fire prevention during winter construction, purchasing materials such as cotton gloves, cotton shoe covers, and boilers, and have begun building warm sheds. To ensure proper temperature measurement during winter, temperature measurement stations have been established at all construction sites. In addition, some construction sites have been educating employees about winter construction. Employees participating in winter construction have stated, "We must carry the project through to the end!"

    北京市各工地进行冬季施工的准备工作
    北京市基本建设单位积极进行冬季施工的准备工作。据初步统计，北京市今年要在冬季施工的工地共有五十六个，施工面积达五十万多平方公尺。这是北京市第一次大规模地进行冬季施工。现在，已确定冬季施工的工地都配备了专职干部，初步编制了施工组织设计。有的工地如北京市百货大楼、钢铁学院等工地还制定了冬季施工的进度计划、安全措施计划、操作规程及各种责任制度等。有的工地还准备了冬季施工中用的“里脚手”、“马利采夫锹”等先进工具。很多工地还进行了冬季施工中的防寒、照明和消防的准备，购置了棉手套、棉鞋盖、锅炉等器材，并已开始修盖暖棚等。为了做好冬季测温工作，各工地普遍建立了测温站。此外，有一些工地已在职工中进行了冬季施工的教育。参加冬季施工的职工表示：“一定要把工程进行到底！”
