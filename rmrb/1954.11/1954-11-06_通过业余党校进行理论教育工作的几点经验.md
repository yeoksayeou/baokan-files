Several Experiences in Conducting Theoretical Education Work Through Spare-Time Party Schools
The Teaching Affairs Office of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee Spare-Time Party School

The Spare-Time Party School of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee was established in the spring of 1951. It is a full-time institution under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, dedicated to the study of cadres directly under the provincial authorities. The Spare-Time Party School has a Teaching Affairs Office, which is further divided into Theoretical and Cultural Departments, responsible for the theoretical and cultural studies of cadres directly under the provincial authorities, respectively. The Theoretical Department has a total of four full-time cadres, who are in charge of the theoretical study of cadres in the intermediate and primary groups directly under the provincial authorities. Over the past three years, with the strong support of the Provincial Party Committee and the direct leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, the Spare-Time Party School has successively led the on-the-job cadres in studying "Reader on the Chinese Revolution," "Reader on Political Common Sense," "A Brief History of Social Development," "A Concise History of the Chinese Communist Party," "Reader on Common Sense of Economic Construction," and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and has explored some experiences in guiding learning. We have the following experiences in conducting theoretical education work through spare-time party schools:

I. Strengthening Ideological Leadership and Theoretical Guidance

(1) Correcting the attitude of cadres towards theoretical study. Our approach is as follows: Before each study session, we universally collect ideological information through the party branches and study tutors of various organs, conduct key investigations, and concentrate the information for analysis and research to identify and solve common problems. For example, when the primary group students began to study "Reader on Common Sense of Economic Construction," some lacked confidence, and some believed that it was "unrelated to their own work." In response to this situation, we convened a conference of students from organs directly under the province participating in the intermediate and primary groups' theoretical study, where the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee made a mobilization report, explaining the importance of learning. After the meeting, many branches organized chats and discussions to eliminate the main ideological obstacles. For some ideological problems that continued to be discovered later, we promptly reported them to the teachers to facilitate their connection with the text and appropriate criticism. At the same time, we also provided individual assistance through the party branches of various organs.

Difficulties encountered by cadres in their studies must be resolved in a timely manner. If we only generally emphasize the importance of learning while neglecting concrete assistance, we will not achieve the desired results. For example, at the beginning of the study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," because most students lacked historical and geographical knowledge of the Soviet Union, we asked the teacher to give a special lecture on it. The Communist Youth League Provincial Committee branch published a blackboard newspaper with explanations of relevant terms. The Highway Bureau branch held a lecture on Soviet geography, outlining the geographical situation involved in Chapter 9. Before the start of Chapter 9, we also organized reports on Chapters 7 and 8. The Study Office printed and distributed reference materials for the study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," introducing a brief history of the Soviet Union, a sketch map of the Soviet Union, political parties, figures, and a chronology of major events.

(2) Clarifying learning requirements and pointing out the key points of study. Before each chapter of study, we hold a meeting of tutors, where the teachers first elaborate on the requirements and key points of studying this chapter, which is the main aspect of guiding learning. In this way, during preview, the tutors can focus on the key points and guide the students to generally understand the basic spirit of the text. In self-study and discussion, they can also grasp the key issues and avoid aimless groping and reading. At the same time, because the purpose of learning is clear, it not only helps to deepen the understanding of the theoretical issues themselves, but also enables a directed and correct connection with reality.

After the start of the general line study, we also organized a reading report meeting for intermediate group tutors, where the tutors pointed out the learning requirements and key points to the students. In the tutors' reports, they first explained which issues they mainly understood in the study of this section, pointed out the main content of each subsection, and which areas needed to be focused on. Then, they talked about their experiences in learning, combined with their own work and thoughts, and conducted self-examination. This kind of report meeting played a great role in helping everyone deeply understand the content and was generally welcomed. Some party branches of organs also began to do this in their own units, and similarly achieved good results.

(3) Organizing teaching research and guiding tutoring work. Most of the 63 part-time theoretical teachers we hired are leading cadres from various organs. They are busy with work and lack time to prepare lessons. Therefore, we cooperated with the Study Office to provide them with assistance in various aspects, such as compiling and distributing lecture outlines, selecting reference materials, holding teaching research meetings, introducing students' ideological situation, reflecting on learning difficulties, and proposing suggestions for improving lectures. Through these methods, we gradually improved their teaching quality.

In addition, we hired 385 study tutors to conduct activities in 91 party branches. Before the start of classes, we organized them to participate in the tutor training class held by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and held tutor experience exchange meetings and reading report meetings to exchange tutoring and reading experiences.

(4) Checking learning results and conducting tests. Our method of checking learning results is mainly to hold symposiums for activists in learning to understand which issues have not been learned well enough, and to what extent. In this way, on the one hand, we can consolidate the results and increase confidence in learning; on the other hand, we can determine the steps for the next stage of learning. Another method is to go to various organs on study days to participate in discussion meetings and conduct regular tests. Before the tests, we must conduct full ideological mobilization, give a certain amount of time for review, or issue a unified review outline. Then, tests are held separately at the same time. After the tests, democratic grading is conducted. We use lectures or tutor meetings to make up for or explain in depth the common problems in the tests. These methods have played a great role in promoting learning.

II. Grasping Characteristics and Doing a Good Job in Organizational Work

On-the-job cadres' spare-time education has many characteristics and its own special difficulties. First, from the perspective of the students: there are many subjects to study (theory, work, current affairs, culture, and technology, etc.); the study time is fragmented (theoretical study requires the use of spare time in addition to the prescribed study time); the theoretical foundation of cadres varies greatly; the cultural level varies; the work of the students is different and they are distributed in various positions; the mobility of cadres is very high, with often one-third of the cadres directly under the province going to the countryside and factories. From the perspective of guidance: teachers and study tutors are all part-time and highly mobile; the degree of importance attached to theoretical study by the administration of various organs varies, and the leadership methods of the party branches are also different; some branches even abandon management. From the perspective of the study plan, the regular theoretical study plan is sometimes changed due to the insertion of temporary study tasks. These are all special circumstances of spare-time theoretical education. We must fully recognize it, grasp it, and adapt to these characteristics to carry out our work. Facts have proved that if we base our work on it, we can carry it out; if we violate it, our work will stagnate; if we ignore it, our work will be "beaten" and passive.

According to the characteristics of spare-time theoretical education, we pay attention to the following points in organizational work:

(1) Pay attention to the flexibility of the teaching plan. When formulating the teaching plan, leave flexible gaps in the progress, and do not arrange it too full or too rigidly, otherwise the plan will be easily disrupted; when hiring teachers, for the same class, hire "main speakers" and "deputy speakers," if the "main speaker" is temporarily on official business, the "deputy speaker" can replace them; in arranging study time, we must take into account the cadres' rest time.

(2) Solving the study problems of cadres going to the countryside. We solve it from two aspects: on the one hand, we promote a set of practical and feasible methods for leading the study of cadres going to the countryside (establishing a special person in charge system in the branch; establishing a correspondence system; establishing a reporting and inspection system, etc.); on the other hand, we unify make-up lessons, or make up lessons separately. For example, once, due to flood control work, a large number of cadres went out, we recorded the lectures and, when they all came back, we conducted a unified make-up lesson for 600 people.

(3) Implement the "three-in-one" method of leading study. The "three-in-one" leadership method refers to the close cooperation of party branch leadership, administrative support, and study backbone (including tutors) taking the lead. This is a powerful guarantee for the study to be sustained and to achieve great results. However, the Spare-Time Party School must do a lot of organizational work to implement this leadership method. For example, using the method of visiting administrative leaders of organs to make administrative cadres pay attention to theoretical study; participating in the study days of organs to understand the implementation of the study system; investigating key branches and talking with comrades in charge of study in the party branch; paying attention to cultivating study backbones; using the form of symposiums to reflect learning requirements and situations, etc. Of particular importance is appropriate criticism and praise. In the "Study Newsletter," we have praised branches such as the Taxation Bureau and the Communist Youth League Provincial Committee, and have also criticized poorer units such as the Cooperative General Society and the Commerce Department, and promptly encouraged units such as the Provincial Statistics Bureau and the Provincial Native Produce Company with circulars. These have played a role in promoting progress in a certain period. For example, the Cooperative General Society branch, after being criticized, immediately convened a joint meeting and proposed improvement methods, thus changing the past situation.

(4) Cultivating key branches and establishing learning models. We have failed in our work of cultivating key branches. Originally, the plan was to focus on key points, but when we started, we "flew all over the sky," grabbing everywhere and abandoning the key points. The reason for this phenomenon is that, on the one hand, we did not make the greatest determination to persevere; on the other hand, we were not clear about how to specifically cultivate the "point" to lead the "surface." From 1952, we began to understand that we should first grasp the typical examples and establish model study branches in the branches directly under the province. So we cultivated the Provincial Taxation Bureau and the Communist Youth League Provincial Committee branches, and widely introduced the experience of these two branches in leading study through the 1952 Provincial Party Representatives Congress and the 1953 Model Reward Meeting. Later, in each study stage, special personnel were responsible for drawing experience from these two branches for promotion. Now these two branches have become models. Nineteen branches, including the Provincial Department Store Company and the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau, have sent people to study their experience in leading study. Because the Provincial Taxation Bureau has become a model study unit among the branches directly under the province, it has also driven and influenced many county taxation bureaus to become model study units in the county. The main experiences of these two branches have been compiled by us and published in newspapers and periodicals. In addition, we also require each branch to cultivate study models and activists to establish examples. We have rewarded 314 model students.

(5) Strengthening the theoretical and professional study of full-time cadres in the Spare-Time Party School. Our full-time cadres have a very low theoretical level and insufficient work experience. Only by intensifying study and delving into business can we improve the work of the Spare-Time Party School. All full-time cadres participate in the teacher and tutor training classes to listen to lectures, and stipulate a certain amount of time every day to systematically study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism. We have now studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and are starting to study "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" from the beginning. In professional study, in addition to reading instructions, commentaries, and experiences related to cadre study in newspapers and periodicals, we also study theoretical articles related to cadre theoretical study. We also often organize discussions and research on the instructions of higher authorities.

    通过业余党校进行理论教育工作的几点经验
    中共吉林省委业余党校教务处
    中共吉林省委业余党校是在一九五一年春成立的。它是省委领导省直属机关干部学习的专职机构。业余党校设有教务处，在教务处下设理论和文化两部，分别负责省直属机关干部的理论和文化学习。理论部共有专职干部四名，分掌省直属机关中、初级组的干部理论学习。三年来，在省委大力支持下和省委宣传部的直接领导下，业余党校先后领导了在职干部关于“中国革命读本”、“政治常识读本”、“社会发展简史”、中共简史、“经济建设常识读本”以及“联共（布）党史”的学习，并摸索出一些指导学习的经验。通过业余党校进行理论教育工作，我们有以下几点经验：
    一、加强思想领导和理论指导
    （一）端正干部学习理论的态度。我们采取的办法是：在每次学习前，通过各机关党支部和学习辅导员普遍收集思想情况，并作重点调查，将情况集中起来，进行分析研究，找出其中带有普遍性的问题，加以解决。如初级组学员在开始学习“经济建设常识读本”时，有的信心不足，有的认为“同自己业务无关”。针对这种情况，我们召开了省直属机关参加中级组和初级组理论学习的学员大会，会上由省委宣传部部长做了动员报告，说明学习的重要性，会后，许多支部又组织了漫谈和讨论，扫除了主要的思想障碍。对于以后继续发现的一些思想问题，我们随时反映给上课的教员，以便于他们能联系课文，进行适当的批判。同时，还通过各机关支部，进行个别帮助。
    干部在学习中的困难问题，必须及时给予解决。如果只一般的强调学习的重要性，而忽视具体帮助，那是不能收到应得的效果的。如在“联共
  （布）党史”学习开始时，由于大多数学员缺乏苏联的历史地理知识，我们就请上课教员专门讲了一次。团省委支部出刊了有关名词解释的黑板报。公路局支部举办了苏联地理讲座，把第九章所涉及的地理情况，划出了略图。在第九章开课前，我们又组织了七、八两章的报告。学习室印发了“联共
  （布）党史”学习参考资料，介绍了苏联简史、苏联略图、党派、人物和大事记等资料。
    （二）明确学习要求，指出学习重点。我们在每一章学习前召开辅导员会议，教员首先阐述学习这一章的要求和重点，这是指导学习的主要方面。这样在预习中，辅导员能围绕重点，引导学员概括地领会课文的基本精神。在自修和讨论中，也能抓住关键问题，避免了茫无头绪的乱抓乱看。同时由于明确了学习的目的，不但有助于加深理论问题本身的理解，还能有方向的、正确的联系实际。
    在总路线学习开始之后，我们又组织了中级组辅导员读书报告会，由辅导员向学员指出学习要求和重点。在辅导员报告中，首先说明自己在这一部分的学习中，主要弄通了哪几个问题，并指出每小节的主要内容是什么，哪些地方需要着重研究，然后，他们谈到自己在学习中的体会，联系自己的工作和思想，进行检查。这种报告会在帮助大家深入领会内容上，作用很大，受到普遍的欢迎。有些机关党支部也开始在本单位这样做，同样获得了较好的效果。
      （三）组织教学研究、指导辅导工作。我们聘请的六十三名兼职理论教员大多是各机关的领导干部。他们工作繁忙，缺乏备课时间。因此我们同学习室配合，从各方面给予他们以帮助，如编写、印发讲课提要，选定参考材料，开好教学研究会，介绍学员思想情况，反映学习上的疑难问题，提出改进讲课的意见等等，通过这些办法，逐步提高他们的教学质量。
    此外，我们聘有三百八十五名学习辅导员，分别到九十一个党支部去进行活动。在开课前，组织他们参加省委宣传部举办的辅导员训练班，并召开辅导员经验交流会、读书报告会，交流辅导经验和读书经验。
      （四）检查学习效果，进行测验。我们检查学习效果的办法，主要是开学习积极分子座谈会，了解哪些问题学得还不够，不够的程度到底如何。这样，一方面可以巩固效果，提高学习信心，另一方面，为下一步学习确定步骤。再就是在学习日到各机关去参加讨论会，定期进行测验。测验前要进行较充分的思想动员，给一定的复习时间，或发给统一的复习提纲。然后在同一时间内，分头举行测验。测验后进行民主评卷。我们将测验中带有普遍性的问题，通过讲课或辅导员会议进行补课，或深入讲解。这些办法对学习起了很大的推动作用。
    二、掌握特点，做好组织工作
    在职干部的业余教育，有很多特点，也有它特殊的困难。首先从学员方面来看：学习科目多（理论、业务、时事、文化以及技术等）；学习时间零碎（理论学习除规定的学习时间外，均须利用业余时间）；干部理论基础参差不齐；文化程度有高有低；学员业务不同，分布在各种不同岗位上；干部流动性很大，省直属机关干部经常有三分之一下乡下厂。再以指导力量来看：教员，学习辅导员都是兼职的，流动性也很大，各机关行政上对理论学习的重视程度不一，党支部领导方法也不同；甚至还有的支部放弃不管。从学习计划来看，经常的理论学习计划，有时因插进临时的学习任务就要变动。这些都是业余理论教育的特殊情况。我们必须充分认识它，掌握它，适应这些特点进行工作。事实证明：依据它，工作就能开展；违反它，工作就停滞不前；忽视它，工作就要“挨打”、被动。
    根据业余理论教育的特点，我们在组织工作上注意下面几点：
    （一）注意教学计划的灵活性。在制定教学计划时，在进度上留出机动的空隙时间，不可排得过满过死，否则计划就容易被打乱；在聘请教员时，同一堂课，要聘“主讲”“副讲”，“主讲”教员临时公出，可由“副讲”代替；在安排学习时间上，必须照顾干部的休息时间。
    （二）解决下乡干部的学习问题。我们从两个方面来解决，一方面推广一套切实可行的领导下乡干部学习的办法（支部设专人负责制；建立通信制；建立汇报检查制度等）；另一方面统一补课，或分别补课。比如有一次因防汛工作，大批干部外出，我们在讲课时进行录音，当他们都回来之后，进行了一次六百人的统一补课。
   （三）贯彻“三位一体”的领导学习的方法。“三位一体”的领导方法，就是指党支部领导、行政支持、学习骨干（包括辅导员）带头三者密切配合的方法，这是学习所以能坚持，并能获得巨大效果的有力保证。但业余党校必须做许多组织工作，才能贯彻这样的领导方法。例如用访问机关行政领导干部的办法，使行政干部重视理论学习；参加机关的学习日，了解执行学习制度的情况；调查重点支部，和党支部负责学习的同志谈话；注意培养学习骨干；通过座谈会形式来反映学习要求和情况等等。其中尤为重要的是恰如其分的批评与表扬。在“学习通讯”上，我们曾表扬了税务局、团省委等支部，也曾批评了合作总社、商业厅等较差的单位，并用通报及时地鼓励了省统计局、省土产公司等单位。这都在一定时期起了推动的作用。如合作总社支部，经过批评后，立即召集了联席会议，提出了改进的办法，因而改变了过去的情况。
    （四）培养重点支部，树立学习榜样。在培养重点支部工作上，我们曾失败过。原来计划上定下来搞重点，但一做起来就“满天飞”，到处抓，扔了重点。发生这种现象的原因，一方面是没有下最大决心来坚持；一方面对如何具体地培养“点”领导“面”的方法也不明确。从一九五二年起，我们才开始懂得先抓好典型，在省直属机关支部中树立学习模范支部。于是我们培养了省税务局和团省委两个支部，通过一九五二年省直属机关党代表大会和一九五三年奖励模范会，广泛地介绍这两个支部领导学习的经验，以后每个学习阶段也都有专人负责，从这两个支部吸取经验加以推广。现在这两个支部已成为榜样。省百货公司、省森林工业管理局等十九个支部，都曾派人去学习他们领导学习的经验。由于省税务局成为省直属机关支部中的学习模范单位，同时带动和影响许多县税务局，也成为县的学习模范单位。他们这两个支部的主要经验，已由我们整理出来在报刊上发表过。此外，我们并要求各支部培养学习模范和积极分子树立榜样。我们曾奖励了三百一十四名模范学员。
    （五）加强业余党校专职干部的理论学习和业务学习。我们专职干部理论水平很低，工作经验不足，只有加紧学习和钻研业务，才能提高业余党校的工作。专职干部都参加各次教员、辅导员训练班听课，每天规定出一定时间有计划地学习马克思列宁主义的经典著作，现已学习了“毛泽东选集”，并正在从头学习“联共（布）党史”。在业务学习上，除阅读报刊上有关干部学习方面的指示、评论和经验外，还学习一些有关干部理论学习的理论文章。对上级的指示，也经常组织起来进行讨论和研究。
