Anshan City Workers Enthusiastically Save
    The broad masses of workers in Anshan City are actively participating in savings. By the end of October, the savings amount had reached 31 billion yuan, an increase of 117% compared to the end of October last year, and more than 300 times the increase compared to the end of 1949. The number of savings accounts has also increased from more than 1,600 in 1949 to more than 56,000.
    Since the third quarter of last year, the Anshan branch of the People's Bank of China has successively established 42 small savings kiosks at various entrances and exits of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, major factories and mines, collective dormitories, and busy streets and major department stores in the city. At present, there are 59 institutions in the city that accept workers' deposits, making it quite convenient for workers to deposit and withdraw money.
    In order to encourage the broad masses of workers to actively save, the Anshan branch of the People's Bank of China has been conducting "lump-sum withdrawal with prize savings" since July this year. This type of savings can accumulate a large number of scattered funds, with 40,000 yuan per account, and principal repaid in six months. Since July, 40,000 workers have participated in this savings program. By the end of October, the city's savings amount had increased by 13 billion yuan solely due to the implementation of this savings program. (Liaoning Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    鞍山市职工踊跃储蓄
    鞍山市广大职工踊跃参加储蓄。到十月底止，储蓄额已达三百一十亿元，比去年十月底增加了百分之一百一十七，比一九四九年底增加了三百多倍。储蓄户数也由一九四九年的一千六百多户增加到五万六千多户。
    中国人民银行鞍山分行从去年第三季度起，在鞍山钢铁公司的各个出入门、全市主要厂矿和集体宿舍，以及市内繁华街道、大百货商店等地陆续建立了四十二个小型储蓄亭。目前，全市共有五十九个收储职工存款的机构，职工们存款取款相当方便。
    为了鼓励广大职工踊跃储蓄，中国人民银行鞍山分行从今年七月份起举办了“零存整取有奖储蓄”。这种储蓄可以积聚大批零散款项，四万元为一户，六个月还本。从七月份以来，参加这一储蓄的职工已有四万人。到十月底止，仅因开展这一储蓄，就使全市的储蓄额增加了一百三十亿元。  （本报辽宁记者站）
