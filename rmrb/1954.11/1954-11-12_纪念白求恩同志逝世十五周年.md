    Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of Comrade Bethune's Death
    Ye Qingshan
    This year, November 12th, marks the fifteenth anniversary of the death of Comrade Bethune, the great internationalist fighter, the outstanding son of the Canadian people, and the loyal friend of the Chinese people. Sixteen years ago, when the Chinese people were engaged in a difficult War of Resistance Against Japan, this internationalist fighter, who had just returned to his homeland of Canada from the anti-fascist front in Spain, deeply felt that the Chinese people fighting for justice were in urgent need of doctors. He believed that China was a place where he should go and could play a role. In January 1938, he accepted the commission of the Canadian Labor Progressive Party and the American Communist Party, led a joint Canadian and American medical team, crossed the ocean, and came to Yan'an, the center of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, to participate in the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Because of his noble character, excellent work style, and superb medical skills, he made great contributions to the medical and health work in the Liberated Areas. In the extremely difficult material conditions of the combat environment, he established regular hospitals for us, prepared for the establishment of hygiene schools, and helped us rectify medical organizations. Unfortunately, he contracted a virus while rescuing the wounded and died on November 12, 1939.
    Comrade Bethune gave his life for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao said: "What is the spirit of a foreigner who, without any selfish motives, regards the liberation cause of the Chinese people as his own? This is the spirit of internationalism, this is the spirit of communism."
    Comrade Bethune was in China for only a little over a year, but he did a lot of work and gave us profound education. Today, when the people of the whole country are building socialism with full confidence in victory, recalling the deeds of Comrade Bethune, the internationalist who fought and lived with us, we feel greatly encouraged.
    Comrade Bethune arrived in Yan'an in April 1938. Soon, he crossed the Yellow River with the army, passed through the Zhengtai Road blockade line, and arrived in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region far behind enemy lines. On the second day of his arrival in the Border Region, he began his intense work. He was not afraid of fatigue and rarely rested. When there were many wounded and sick, he worked day and night. In the famous Battle of Qihui in Hejian, he worked continuously for three days and three nights until the work was completed before he rested. Sometimes he even forgot to eat and sleep while rescuing the wounded and sick on the front line. He never let the wounded and sick come to him, but went to the wounded and sick himself. He said, "The era when doctors sat at home waiting for patients to knock on the door is over. Revolutionary doctors should run to the patients, and the sooner the better." He always tried his best to give the wounded and sick surgical treatment as soon as possible, not letting go of even a minute or a second. He believed that delaying treatment was a sin. He often told people, "Wounded people with head, abdominal, and chest injuries do not need to register, take them to the operating table immediately." "Whenever a seriously injured person comes, even if I am asleep, wake me up." As long as the wounded and sick needed him, he immediately changed his life routine, and he always thought of the wounded and sick in every way.
    The material conditions in the Liberated Areas were very bad. In the battlefield hospitals of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, in addition to some simple medical equipment brought by Comrade Bethune, many field surgery and patient recuperation necessities were extremely scarce. Comrade Bethune did not relax his work because of this. He overcame all difficulties with his working enthusiasm and hard work; in addition to carefully and accurately performing surgery and diagnosing prescriptions for the wounded and sick, he took time to guide carpenters, blacksmiths, and tinsmiths to do some seemingly rough and tedious work that was closely related to the treatment and recuperation of the wounded and sick. He taught carpenters to make fracture traction frames, renovate beds, and make wooden utensils for auxiliary medical treatment and recuperation; he also guided blacksmiths and tinsmiths to make Thomas splints, tin buckets, medical probes, tweezers, and pliers. He said, "A battlefield surgeon must also be a carpenter, tailor, blacksmith, and barber. With these four skills, he is a good surgeon." In the environment of guerrilla warfare, the medical team had to move with the troops at any time and carry out medical rescue work at any time. However, on the rugged mountain roads with frequent battles, vehicles could not be used, and the transportation of medical equipment and medicines was very difficult. Comrade Bethune created the "Lugouqiao" carrying method according to the new situation, putting the medicines, equipment, and dressings used in medical treatment in an orderly manner on the carrying rack, so that work could begin as soon as the destination was reached. In combat, at a distance of two or three kilometers from the front line, he was still able to perform early surgical treatment of the wounded, which undoubtedly overcame many difficulties.
    Comrade Bethune was a thoracic surgeon of international renown, but he was not arrogant about his outstanding skills. He never regarded scientific knowledge as private property, and he dedicated all his skills and knowledge to the people. Soon after Comrade Bethune arrived in the Border Region, he quickly realized in his practical work that our medical level was not high and there were not enough medical personnel. On the one hand, he actively put forward opinions on establishing hygiene schools and holding training classes. At the same time, he also squeezed time to impart his extensive knowledge and experience to every medical staff member. In such a difficult and busy work situation, he always took out one or two hours every other day to lecture the medical staff. Without textbooks, he sacrificed sleep to write teaching materials under the oil lamp, and then patiently wrote, drew, and lectured on the blackboard. He often told his comrades, "We must learn technology well, because good technology in medicine and surgery can heal the wounded faster."
    Comrade Bethune cared for every wounded and sick person with utmost care. He had to see many patients every day, but for each patient, he first made a detailed understanding, diagnosis, and examination, and then decided on the treatment method, handed it over to reliable doctors and nurses to do, and he would check it several times a day. He would never easily perform surgery on a wounded person whose condition was unclear; if there was any hope of restoring function, he would never easily destroy his function. He loved the wounded and sick, not only in striving not to let a wounded person die, striving not to let a wounded person become disabled, and giving them effective treatment, but also in caring for the daily lives of the wounded and sick. When he found that the weather was getting cold and the wounded had not yet covered themselves with quilts, he gave his quilt to the seriously wounded. He also donated his allowance to the hospital to subsidize the nutrition expenses of the convalescents and transferred the fruits and cigarettes given to him by the hospital to the convalescents. He said, "We must take care of the convalescents, the convalescents must wear good clothes and eat good food."
    Although Comrade Bethune was only in China for a little over a year, his great internationalist spirit, excellent work style, and communist noble character have left a deep impression on me. Chairman Mao taught us to learn from Comrade Bethune very well, and to learn from his spirit of no selfishness or self-interest. To train ourselves to be people who are very beneficial to the people; to become a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from low interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people. On the occasion of commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of Comrade Bethune's death, recalling Comrade Bethune's heroic deeds and revisiting Chairman Mao's teachings, our medical workers should better learn from Comrade Bethune and work harder for the health of the people.

    纪念白求恩同志逝世十五周年
    叶青山
    今年的十一月十二日，是伟大的国际主义战士、加拿大人民的优秀儿子、中国人民的忠实朋友白求恩同志逝世十五周年纪念日。十六年前，正当中国人民进行着艰苦的抗日战争的时候，这位刚从西班牙反法西斯战线上回到自己祖国——加拿大的国际主义战士，深切地感觉到为正义而战的中国人民迫切地需要医生，他认为中国是他应当去而且能发挥作用的地方。他在一九三八年一月接受了加拿大劳工进步党和美国共产党的委托，率领着一个加拿大和美国联合医疗队，远渡重洋，来到中国的抗日战争中心——延安，参加了中国人民的解放事业。由于他的高贵品质、优良的工作作风和卓越的医疗技能，他给解放区的医疗卫生工作作了很大的贡献。在物质条件极端困难的战斗环境里，他为我们建立了正规医院，筹建了卫生学校，并帮助我们整顿了医疗组织。但不幸他为救治伤员感染了病毒，在一九三九年十一月十二日以身殉职。
    白求恩同志为了中国人民的解放事业献出了自己的生命。毛主席说：一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神。
    白求恩同志在中国只有一年多的时间，他作了许多工作，给了我们以深刻的教育。在全国人民满怀着胜利信心建设社会主义的今天，回忆起曾和我们战斗在一起，生活在一起的国际主义者白求恩同志的事迹，我们感到极大的鼓舞。
    白求恩同志是在一九三八年四月到达延安的。不久，便随军渡过黄河，通过正太路封锁线，到达远在敌后的晋察冀边区。就在到达边区的第二天，他便开始了紧张的工作。他不怕劳累，很少休息，遇到伤病员多的时候，他更是夜以继日地工作。在著名的河间齐会战斗中，他连续工作了三天三夜，直到工作完毕，方才休息。有时他还废寝忘食地在火线上抢救伤病员。他从不让伤病员来找自己，而是自己去找伤病员。他说：“医生坐在家里等病人来叩门的时代已经过去了，革命的医生应该跑到病人那里去，而且愈早愈好。”他总是想尽一切办法，尽早地使伤病员得到手术处理，那怕是一分一秒钟也不轻易放过。他认为，延误治疗，这是罪恶。他常常告诉人们说：“凡是头、腹、胸伤的伤员，不需要登记，立刻抬到手术台来。”“凡是重伤员来了，就是我睡了也要叫醒我。”只要伤病员需要他，他立刻改变自己的生活常规，他处处为伤病员着想。
    解放区的物质条件很坏。在晋察冀边区战地医院里，除了白求恩同志带来的一些简单的医疗器械外，许多野战外科和病员疗养的必需器材都是异常缺乏的。白求恩同志并没有因此而放松工作，他凭着他的劳动热情和艰苦的工作来克服一切困难；他除了细心、准确地为伤病员施行手术和诊断处方外，一有空闲，便指导木工、铁匠、锡匠做一些看来粗糙、繁琐，但对伤病员的治疗和疗养有着密切关系的工作。他教导木工做骨折牵引架，装修病床和制作一些辅助医疗和疗养用的木器；他还指导铁匠、锡匠作妥马氏夹板，洋铁水桶、医用探针、镊子、钳子。他说：“一个战地外科医生，同时要是木匠、缝纫匠、铁匠和理发匠，有这四匠，才是个好的外科医生。”在游击战争的环境中，医疗队随时要跟着部队转移，随时要进行医疗救护工作。但是在战斗频繁的崎岖山路上，不能使用车辆，医疗器材和药品的运输十分困难，白求恩同志便根据新的情况创造了“芦沟桥”驮运法，把医疗应用的药品、器械、敷料有秩序地放在驮架上，一到目的地即可开始工作。在战斗中，在距离火线二、三公里的情况下，他仍能对伤员进行早期手术的处理，那无疑地是克服了许多困难的。
    白求恩同志是一位享有国际声誉的胸腔外科专家，但他并没有以自己卓越的技能而自傲，他从没有把科学知识当作私产，他将自己所有的技能和知识献给了人民。白求恩同志到边区不久，在实际工作中，很快地便了解到我们的医疗水平不高，医务人员不够，他一方面积极提出创办卫生学校和举办训练班的意见，同时，还挤时间把他广博的学识和经验传授给每一个医务人员。在那样艰苦而繁忙的工作情况下，他每隔一天总要抽出一两个小时给医务人员讲课。没有课本，他便牺牲睡眠在油灯下编写教材，然后在黑板上不惮其烦地一边写，一边画，一边讲。他常常告诉同志们说：“我们一定要学好技术，因为在医药和外科上的好技术，可以更快医好伤员。”
    白求恩同志对每一个伤病员都是关怀备至的。他每天要看很多的病员，但对每个病员都是先作了详细了解、诊断和检查，然后再决定治疗的办法，交给可靠的医生和护士去作，并且他要一日数次地去检查。他对病情不清楚的伤员，决不轻易施手术；凡是有一点希望可以恢复机能的，他决不轻易地破坏他的机能。他爱护伤员，不仅表现在争取不使一个伤员死亡，争取不让一个伤员残废，给他们以有效的治疗，而且表现在对伤病员的日常生活的关怀上。当他发现天气凉了而伤员还没有盖上棉被子的时候，他就把自己的被子给重伤员盖。他还把自己的津贴捐给医院，贴补休养员的营养费，把医院给他的水果和纸烟转送给休养员。他说：“要爱护休养员，休养员要穿好的，吃好的。”
    白求恩同志在中国虽然仅仅只有一年多的时间，但他那伟大的国际主义精神，优良的工作作风，共产主义的高贵品质都给我以深刻的印象。毛主席教导我们，要我们很好地学习白求恩同志，学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。把自己锻炼成为大有利于人民的人；成为一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。在纪念白求恩同志逝世十五周年的今天，回忆白求恩同志的英雄事迹，重温毛主席的教言，我们医务工作者应当更好地学习白求恩同志，更好地为人民的健康而努力工作。
