    Si Ping Oil and Liquor Factory, Li Chuanjiang's Workshop
    Implementing the Resolutions of the National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference
    The workers in the oil pressing workshop of the Si Ping Oil and Liquor Factory, where Li Chuanjiang works, are actively implementing the resolutions of the National Oil Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference. They have decided to continue to increase the oil extraction rate and increase the production of soybean oil by 130,000 jin for the country from December this year to the end of the third quarter of next year.
    After Li Chuanjiang returned to the factory in early November after attending the meeting in Beijing, he conveyed the resolutions of the meeting to all the workers in the oil pressing workshop the next day. Then, a workshop production meeting was held to study technical measures to continue to increase the oil extraction rate. An inspection team was also established in the workshop to check the workers' implementation of operating procedures and help them master Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction method. In previous years, the amount of oil extracted from soybeans always decreased when new beans came on the market. At this time last year, the maximum oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans was only thirteen jin three liang; but now the oil yield per hundred jin of new soybeans in this workshop has been increased to thirteen jin nine liang four qian, and the residual oil in the soybean cake has also been reduced to 4.26 percent.

    四平油酒制造厂李川江所在的车间
    贯彻全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会决议
    李川江所在的四平油酒制造厂榨油车间的职工们，积极贯彻全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会的决议，他们决定继续提高出油率，从今年十二月起到明年第三季度末，为国家增产十三万斤豆油。
    李川江十一月初在北京开完会回厂以后，第二天起就向榨油车间的全体工人传达这次会议的决议。接着就举行车间生产会议，研究继续提高出油率的技术措施。车间里又成立了检查小组，检查工人执行操作规程的情形，并帮助工人掌握李川江大豆榨油操作法。往年每当新豆上市时，大豆的出油量总要降低，去年这时每百斤大豆最高只出油十三斤三两；但现在这个车间每百斤新大豆的出油量已提高到十三斤九两四钱，豆饼中残存的油也降低到百分之四点二六。　（新华社）
