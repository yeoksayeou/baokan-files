Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: The Ministry of Railways has begun implementing measures this year to gradually carry out technical transformation of existing railways.

Since China entered the period of planned economic construction, the freight burden on railways has been increasing day by day, and the existing transportation capacity cannot keep up with the needs of economic construction. For example, the Sujiatun and Nancang marshalling yards are experiencing vehicle congestion due to the high volume of traffic from north and south, and the equipment capacity cannot fully meet the needs of transport volume, which affects the timely supply of materials.

From January to now, the technical transformation of railways has enhanced the transportation capacity of China's major railway lines to some extent. The entire Beijing-Shenyang line was fully opened to double-track traffic on November 12th. The newly built double-track between Shuangyangdian and Xinmin alone increased the train passing capacity on the Jinzhou to Dahushan section by 88.9 percent, and the train passing capacity between Dahushan and Gaotaishan by more than 66 percent. New double-track railways have been built this year on the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou line from Songlindian to Dingxing, Liangxiang to Liulihe, and Xidaokou to Changxindian. The roadbed engineering has been completed, and most of the track laying has been completed. The section between Songlindian and Dingxing, which is already open to traffic, has increased its train passing capacity by more than 32 percent. Four sections of double-track railway have also been repaired between Anshan and Dalian this year. In addition, passing loops and signal stations have been added to railway trunk lines with particularly heavy traffic this year. The transportation capacity of railways such as the Binzhou (Harbin-Manzhouli) line, Su (Sujiatun)-Fu (Fushun) line, Jinpu line, Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line, Shanghai-Nanjing line, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi line have all been improved as a result. The train passing capacity between Jinhua and Hangzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line has been increased by 30 percent.

In order to increase traffic capacity, many stations have added sidings and extended station tracks. By the end of this year, the total length of sidings added and station tracks extended on railways across the country will be approximately 280 kilometers. Many large stations, although already large in scale, are still crowded. Stations such as Sujiatun near Shenyang, Nancang near Tianjin, as well as Siping, Jinzhou, and Fengtai have all been planned for expansion and renovation. Construction has already begun on Sujiatun Station and Nancang Station.

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: By mid-November, forty-one newly built railway spur lines have been completed across the country. Most of these spur lines are industrial spur lines. They connect newly emerging or previously inaccessible industrial and mining areas with railway trunk lines, using trains instead of trucks and horse-drawn carts to transport various large machines and large quantities of materials to the industrial and mining areas, and to transport products out more quickly.

Some of the spur lines built by the Taiyuan Railway Administration this year were completed on schedule in accordance with the needs of the relevant factory and mine capital construction progress. The early completion of the fifth and sixth sidings of the special railway line leading to the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant ensured the timely transportation of important machinery and equipment and large quantities of building materials for the new plant, saving the plant nearly 100 million yuan per day in transportation costs for trucks and horse-drawn carts. The on-time completion of the special railway line leading to the Xinzhou Kiln of Datong Coal Mine not only ensured that the mine could produce coal immediately after its restoration, but also ensured the timely supply of equipment needed for the reconstruction of the mine.

    铁道部对现有铁路进行技术改造
    铁路运输能力逐步提高
    今年新修的四十一条铁路专用线已完工
    【新华社二十六日讯】铁道部从今年开始采取了对现有铁路逐步进行技术改造的措施。
    我国进入有计划经济建设时期以来，铁路的货运负担一天天加重，现有运输能力赶不上经济建设的需要。如苏家屯和南仓这两个大编组站，就因为南来北往的车太多，设备能力不能完全适应运量需要，以致有时发生车辆拥塞现象，影响了物资的及时供应。
    从今年一月到现在，铁路的技术改造已使我国主要铁路干线的运输能力有所增强。京沈全线在十一月十二日全部实现了双轨通车。仅双羊店到新民间今年新修的双轨通车后，锦州到大虎山这个区段的列车通过能力就增加了百分之八十八点九，大虎山到高台山间列车通过能力增加了百分之六十六多。京汉线北段的松林店到定兴、良乡到琉璃河、西道口到长辛店今年都新修了双轨铁路，路基工程已全部完工，铺轨工程也已完成大半。已经通车的松林店到定兴间，列车通过能力提高了百分之三十二多。鞍山到大连间今年也修复了四个区段的双轨铁路。另外，在运输特别繁忙的铁路干线上，今年还增设了会让站和信号所。滨（哈尔滨）洲（满洲里）线、苏（苏家屯）抚（抚顺）线、津浦线、石太线、沪宁线、浙赣线等铁路的运输能力都因此提高了。浙赣线金华到杭州间的列车通过能力就提高了百分之三十。
    为了增加行车能力，许多车站增设了股道，延长了站线。到今年年底，全国铁路增设的股道和总共延长的站线共约有二百八十公里。许多大车站虽然原有的规模已经很大，但是仍然拥挤不开。沈阳附近的苏家屯、天津附近的南仓，以及四平、锦州、丰台等车站都已计划进行扩建和改建。其中苏家屯站和南仓站已经动工。
    【新华社二十六日讯】到十一月中旬，全国已有四十一条新修的铁路专用线完工了。这些专用线绝大部分都是工业专用线。它们使新兴的或原来交通不便的工矿区和铁路干线联接起来，用火车代替汽车和马车把各种大型机器和大量物资运到工矿区去，把产品更快地运出来。
    太原铁路管理局今年修筑的一些专用线，就是按照有关厂矿基本建设进程的需要按期完工的。通往新建太原第一发电厂专用线的第五、六号股道提前修成后，为这个新建厂及时运输了重要机器设备和大量建筑材料，使这个厂每天节省近一亿元的汽车、马车运输费用。通往大同煤矿忻州窑专用线的按期完成，不但保证这个矿能够在恢复后随即出煤，并使改建矿井所需的器材得到了及时供应。
