Xinhua News Agency report from Bonn: The Bonn authorities, in order to freely implement their policy of re-militarization and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Germany, are intensifying their reactionary suppression of democratic organizations in West Germany, primarily targeting the German Communist Party.

The West German Federal Constitutional Court began hearing the case against the German Communist Party on the 23rd. The main "crime" accused against the German Communist Party is that the German Communist Party published the "German Communist Party Program for Restoring German National Unity" in 1952. This program called for free all-German elections and the restoration of Germany as a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent nation.

The trial of the German Communist Party was prepared over a long period. Even before the trial began, the Adenauer government issued an arrest warrant for the Chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, and imprisoned a number of leaders of the German Communist Party, including Central Committee members Reese, Angerford, Zemke, Redwin, Gamper, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th: People in many regions of East and West Germany are strongly protesting the Bonn authorities' trial of the German Communist Party.

More than 16,000 resolutions and letters have been sent to the West German Federal Constitutional Court, protesting the Bonn authorities' political conspiracy to persecute the German Communist Party.

In the German Democratic Republic, workers, office workers, youth, women, and legal professionals in Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurth, Karl Marx Stadt, Frankfurt an der Oder, and other regions have held rallies to protest the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party.

In West Germany, 10,000 residents of Hamburg held a torchlight demonstration on the evening of the 22nd, with demonstrators chanting: "We want work and bread, not a ban on the German Communist Party." Workers in Bremerhaven held a large demonstration on the first night of the trial, with the masses shouting slogans such as "Banning the German Communist Party will bring war and death." Miners in Darmstadt signed petitions protesting this event. Residents of the Regensburg area sent a delegation composed of trade union and people from all walks of life to the Karlsruhe Court.

Residents of the Kreuzberg district (American sector) of West Berlin held a meeting demanding an immediate halt to the trial of the German Communist Party. In a letter to the West German Federal Constitutional Court, they stated: "We do not want to go down the fatal path that the German people were forced to take after the German Communist Party was banned in Germany in 1933."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th: At the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, West Germany, where the German Communist Party was being tried, Dr. Krüger, the lawyer representing the German Communist Party, read out a statement by Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party. The statement condemned Adenauer's treasonous actions and protested the Adenauer government's order to arrest Reimann and several members of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party because they had drawn up a plan for the peaceful reunification of Germany. The statement pointed out: The German Communist Party represents the hopes and desires of all responsible Germans who are committed to peacefully restoring German unity on a democratic basis. The German Communist Party represents the invincible Marxist-Leninist worldview, and represents the socialist world of tomorrow—a world without war and exploitation of man by man. The German Communist Party is the spokesman for the national will calling for Germans to understand each other and hold free and democratic all-German elections, is a staunch fighter for a collective security system, and is a firm opponent of the London and Paris Accords. The reason the Bonn government is trying the German Communist Party is to suppress all democratic forces in West Germany who oppose the war policy by persecuting the Communist Party.

The trial, which began on the 23rd, is being presided over by former Nazis. The German Communist Party refused to appear in court because the Bonn government forbade the German Communist Party from attending as a legitimate democratic party and restricted the activities of the German Communist Party. Eight prominent lawyers from West Germany and Berlin represented the German Communist Party in court.

Several hours before the trial began, the authorities dispatched a large number of police and water cannon trucks to the vicinity of the court, but still could not prevent the people of West Germany from gathering in groups in the streets near the court, shouting slogans to protest the trial of the German Communist Party. New slogans constantly appeared on the walls of many buildings in Karlsruhe throughout the day: "Defend the German Communist Party!"

    东西德各地人民抗议波恩当局审讯德共
    雷曼发表声明谴责阿登纳的叛国行为
    据新华社讯：波恩消息：波恩当局为了放手执行重新军国主义化的政策、阻挠德国和平统一，正在加紧对西德的民主组织首先是德国共产党采取反动的镇压政策。
    西德联邦宪法法院已经在二十三日开庭审讯德国共产党。对德国共产党提出控诉的主要“罪名”是：德国共产党曾经在一九五二年发表“德国共产党争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领”。这个纲领要求举行全德自由选举和把德国恢复成为一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的独立国家。
    对德国共产党的审讯是经过长期准备的，早在开庭以前，阿登纳政府就颁布了逮捕德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼的命令，并且囚禁了一批德国共产党的领导人，包括中央委员会雷熙、安根福特、泽姆克、莱德温、加姆普弗等。
    据新华社柏林二十六日电：东西德许多地区的人民强烈地抗议波恩当局审讯德国共产党。
    一万六千件以上的决议和信件已经送致西德联邦宪法法院，抗议波恩当局迫害德国共产党的政治阴谋。
    在德意志民主共和国，来比锡、德累斯顿、欧法特、卡尔·马克思斯塔特、奥得河畔的法兰克福等地区的工人、职员、青年、妇女以及法律界人士纷纷举行集会，抗议西德当局对德国共产党的迫害。
    在西德，汉堡一万个居民在二十二日晚上举行火炬示威游行，示威者的口号是：“我们要工作和面包，不要禁止德国共产党”。不来梅港的工人在审讯的第一天晚上举行了大示威，群众高呼“取缔德国共产党就要带来战争和死亡”的口号。达姆斯塔德的矿工纷纷签名抗议这一事件。累根斯堡地区的居民派出了由工会及各界人士组成的代表团赴加尔斯卢合法院去。
    西柏林克罗埃次堡区（美占区）居民集会要求立即停止审讯德国共产党。他们在写给西德联邦宪法法院的信中说道：“我们不愿再走德国人民在一九三三年德国共产党被禁止之后所被迫走过的那条致命的道路。”
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】在西德加尔斯卢合的联邦宪法法院审讯德国共产党的法庭上，代表德国共产党出庭的律师克吕格尔博士宣读了德国共产党主席雷曼的声明。声明谴责阿登纳的叛国行为，抗议阿登纳政府因为雷曼和德国共产党几个中央委员制订和平统一德国的计划就下令逮捕他们。声明指出：德国共产党代表一切致力于在民主基础上和平地恢复德国统一的有责任感的德国人的希望和意愿。德国共产党代表马克思—列宁主义战无不胜的世界观，代表明天社会主义的世界——一个没有战争和人剥削人的世界。德国共产党是要求德国人彼此谅解和举行全德自由民主选举的全民意愿的发言人，是为集体安全体系而斗争的坚决战士，是伦敦协定和巴黎协定的坚决反对者。波恩政府所以要审讯德国共产党，就是因为要用迫害共产党的方法来镇压反对战争政策的西德一切民主力量。
    二十三日开始的审讯是在前纳粹分子主持下进行的。德国共产党拒绝出庭，因为波恩政府禁止德国共产党作为合法的民主政党出席，并且限制德国共产党的活动。来自西德各地和柏林的八个著名律师代表德国共产党出庭。
    当局在审讯开始前好几个小时，就把大批警察和水龙卡车调到法院附近，但是仍然不能阻止西德人民成群结队地聚集在法院附近的街道上，高呼口号抗议审讯德国共产党。加尔斯卢合许多建筑物的墙壁上整天不断地出现新的标语：“保卫德国共产党！”
