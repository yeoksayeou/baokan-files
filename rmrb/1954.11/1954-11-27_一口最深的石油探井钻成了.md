    The deepest oil exploration well in our country was successfully drilled in a certain mining area of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company on November 16th. At 4 p.m. that day, high-quality crude oil gushed from the bottom of the well, and the well was officially put into production. All the staff and workers in the mining area warmly celebrated this victory.

    This exploration well is 2,700 meters deep. It took a total of one year, nine months, and one day from the start of drilling to its commissioning. Complex geological conditions and high-pressure oil, gas, and water layers were encountered during the drilling process. However, under the leadership of the excellent Soviet drilling engineer D.N. Bissonov, these difficulties were overcome one by one, and the drilling task was completed according to the planned schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一口最深的石油探井钻成了
    中苏石油股份公司某矿区在十一月十六日胜利钻成了我国最深的一口石油探井。当日下午四时，质量良好的原油从井底喷出，这口探井就正式投入了生产。矿区全体职工曾热烈庆祝了这一胜利。
    这口探井深达两千七百公尺，从开钻到投入生产，共历时一年九个月零一天。钻探中间曾遇到了复杂的地质，压力很大的油、气和水层，但在优秀的苏联钻井机师德·恩·比松诺夫领导下，这些困难终于一一克服，按照预定计划完成了钻井任务。　　（新华社）
