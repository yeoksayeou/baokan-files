Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 14th: The naval forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front have sunk Chiang Kai-shek's naval ship "Tai Ping."

At 1:30 AM on the 14th, Chiang Kai-shek's naval ship "Tai Ping" harassed our coastal areas of Zhejiang from the Taizhou Bay sea area between Dachen Island and Yushan Islands occupied by Chiang's bandits. Our People's Liberation Army naval forces immediately, with clever, flexible, sudden, and resolute actions, severely damaged this Chiang Kai-shek's ship "Tai Ping." By 7:30 AM, this Chiang Kai-shek's naval ship "Tai Ping" had completely sunk to the bottom of the sea southeast of Tian'ao Island and northeast of Dachen Island.

The "Tai Ping" warship was given to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique by the United States in 1946. It is 289.5 feet long, 35 feet wide, with 6,000 horsepower, a displacement (full load) of 1,430 tons, equipped with three 3-inch caliber, 50-caliber dual-purpose guns, four 40mm anti-aircraft guns, eleven 20mm anti-aircraft guns, and nine depth charge projectors.

From September 3rd to November 3rd, our People's Liberation Army coastal artillery units shelled Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen islands 47 times. During this period, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft carried out numerous criminal bombings of coastal areas in Fujian, but suffered severe blows from our People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units. At the same time, our People's Liberation Army naval gunboats and sailors actively attacked islands such as Baiquan Island and Beigantang Island, inflicting heavy blows on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the islands.

According to statistics, in the past two months, various units of our People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front shot down a total of 21 Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, including 16 F-47s, 1 B-25, and 4 PB-4Ys; damaged 67 Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, including 58 F-47s, 5 PB-4Ys, 2 F-51s, and 2 B-25s. A total of 88 Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft were shot down or damaged. Three Chiang Kai-shek's destroyers were damaged, and one Chiang Kai-shek's gunboat, one transport vessel, and one tugboat were sunk. One Chiang Kai-shek's floating dock was destroyed. Four Chiang Kai-shek's command organs stationed on Jinmen Island, nine artillery positions (companies), and eight other locations were destroyed. Eleven Chiang Kai-shek's artillery pieces and six various warehouses were destroyed.
