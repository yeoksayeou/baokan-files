Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 21st: Shanghai's entire industrial sector is working to save raw materials and promote the use of substitutes. The Raw Materials Conservation Office, established in September by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee in conjunction with the Industrial Production Committee and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, has drawn over 240 full-time and part-time cadres from relevant departments. It has organized fifteen specialized groups covering coal, electricity, cotton, yarn, tobacco leaves, rubber, oils, chemical raw materials, non-ferrous metals, and waste recycling. Currently, the fourth quarter conservation targets for several major raw materials have been drafted, and each specialized group is conducting extensive mobilization and organizational work.

The work of saving coal and electricity has already begun in industries and factories that use large amounts of coal and electricity. From January to September this year, the implementation of rational electricity conservation in hundreds of large factories resulted in the saving of enough electricity to spin 160,000 pieces of yarn or refine 32,000 tons of steel. In September and October this year, the implementation of coal conservation in over 200 factories that use more than 100 tons of coal per month resulted in the saving of over 25,000 tons of coal citywide, enough for power plants to produce over 47.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Currently, the specialized groups are actively promoting new operating methods and organizing exchanges of experience.

The work of saving raw cotton, cotton yarn, tobacco leaves, oils, and rubber has yielded some experience in state-owned factories. From April to October this year, nineteen state-owned cotton mills saved enough raw cotton to weave over 114,500 bolts of cloth. From July to September, seven state-owned and joint state-private cigarette factories saved enough tobacco leaves to produce over 3,460 cases of cigarettes. The experience of state-owned factories has also been tested and promoted in some private factories. Now, the conservation work for these major industrial raw materials will be extended from state-owned factories to joint state-private and private factories in a systematic manner.

The work of conserving chemical raw materials, dyes, copper, non-ferrous metals, and wood, and promoting the use of substitutes, has also been tested and promoted with a focus. Dye production, supply, and user departments have trial-produced and promoted various domestic dyes and substitutes. From October last year to September this year, the city's increased production of domestic dyes was valued at 30 billion yuan. Two hundred and twenty-two types of copper products have been partially or completely replaced with other raw materials.

Since the third quarter of this year, waste recycling has also expanded the variety of recycled materials. In October, cooperatives citywide recycled an average of approximately 145,000 jin of various waste products per day. Currently, publicity and purchasing work are being strengthened among the general public.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has included the work of conserving raw materials and promoting the use of substitutes in its fourth-quarter industrial production work plan and has instructed Party committees at all levels and relevant departments to strengthen their leadership over this work.

    上海全市工业部门节约原材料使用代用品
    【据新华社上海二十一日电】上海全市的工业部门都在进行节约原材料和推广代用品的工作。今年九月间由上海市人民政府财政经济委员会会同工业生产委员会、上海总工会等领导机关联合设立的节约原材料办公室，已先后从各有关部门抽调了二百四十多个专职和兼职的干部，组织了煤、电、棉、纱、烟叶、橡胶、油脂、化工原料、有色金属、废品回收等十五个专业组。目前，几种主要原材料的第四季度节约指标已经拟订，各专业组正在进行广泛的动员和组织工作。
    节约煤和电的工作，早已在用煤、用电较多的行业和工厂中展开。今年一月到九月，在几百个大型工厂中推行合理节约用电的结果，共节约了足供纺制十六万件纱或炼制三万二千吨钢的电。今年九、十两个月，在二百多家每月用煤一百吨以上的工厂中推行节约用煤的结果，全市工业用煤节约了二万五千多吨，足供发电厂生产四千七百多万度电。现在，专业组正在积极推行新的操作法、组织交流经验。
    节约原棉、棉纱、烟叶、油脂、橡胶的工作，在国营工厂中已取得一些经验。十九个国营棉纺织厂从今年四月到十月，节约了足够织十一万四千五百多匹布的原棉。七个国营和公私合营卷烟厂从七月到九月，节约了可以卷制三千四百六十多箱香烟的烟叶。在若干私营厂中，也试验推广了国营厂的经验。现在这一类主要的工业原材料的节约工作，将有步骤地从国营厂扩展到公私合营和私营厂。
    在化工原料、染料、铜料、有色金属、木材等方面的节约和推广代用品工作，也曾有重点地试验、推行。染料生产、供应和使用部门试制、推广了多种国产染料和代用品。从去年十月到今年九月，全市增产国产染料的价值达三百亿元。有二百二十二种铜制品已经部分或全部以其他原料代用。
    废品回收工作，今年第三季度以来也扩大了回收品种。十月份全市合作社平均每天回收各种废品十四万五千斤左右。目前正在加强对一般市民的宣传工作和收购工作。
    中共上海市委员会已将节约原材料和推广代用品的工作列入第四季度的工业生产工作计划，并指示各级党委及有关部门加强对这一工作的领导。
