    The glorious day of the Mongolian people is November 26th. Thirty years ago—on this day in 1924—the Great People's Khural of Mongolia promulgated Mongolia's first constitution, declaring the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. The victory of the Mongolian people against foreign colonialists and domestic secular and monastic feudal lords was finally consolidated in legislative form. From then on, the Mongolian people became the masters of their own country, began to build a people's democratic state, and create a free and happy new life. Undoubtedly, the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution has great international significance.
    For centuries, the Mongolian people, under the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, suffered in pain and darkness. The light of the great October Socialist Revolution illuminated the path of the Mongolian people's struggle. The outstanding sons of the Mongolian people, Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan, founded the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and led the people's armed uprising in 1921, achieving a brilliant victory for the people's revolution. After the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic correctly led the people of the whole country, under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin's theories, and with the fraternal assistance of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, carried out the cause of national construction. Today, the vigorous and energetic Mongolian people are overcoming the backwardness left over from centuries of hard work and are engaged in the glorious cause of building socialism.
    Indeed, the achievements made by the Mongolian People's Republic under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party over the past thirty years are great. Because of the correct implementation of the policy of developing and consolidating the socialist components of animal husbandry, while comprehensively supporting and developing the economy of working herdsmen, and restricting and squeezing out capitalist factors, and because of the adoption of various effective measures, animal husbandry, as the main sector of the national economy, has been greatly developed and the rate of livestock production has been increased. This year, the number of pastoral production cooperatives has doubled compared to 1948, and the number of members has tripled. The number of livestock owned by individual herdsmen, pastoral production cooperatives, and state-owned ranches increased by 8.7 percent during the first five-year plan period. According to the second five-year plan target, it is expected that in 1957, the total number of livestock in the country will reach 27.5 million, ranking first in the world in terms of the number of livestock owned per capita.
    After the victory of the People's Revolution, Mongolia began to establish and develop industry. Now, many modern industries have appeared on the vast grasslands of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1953, the total industrial output value increased by 270 percent compared to 1940. During the second five-year plan period, the level of industrial production will increase by another 46 percent. With the development of industry, Mongolia's emerging working class is also growing stronger. The number of factory workers has doubled in the past seven years.
    With the development of economic construction, the material and cultural living standards of the Mongolian people have also been significantly improved. The real wages in 1954 increased by 46 percent compared to 1947. In the first half of this year, the implementation of measures such as the mandatory sale system for livestock products, the reduction of prices for industrial products and food, and the increase in prices for livestock products have directly brought great benefits to the working people.
    Before the revolution, Mongolia had only one school for the children of bureaucrats. At the beginning of the victory of the revolution, the vast majority of the people were illiterate. Now, Mongolia's national education and cultural undertakings have been widely developed. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated, and Mongolia has its own highest institution of learning—Mongolian State Choibalsan University. Film, drama, literature, radio, and health care are all developing along with economic development.
    These brilliant achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in economic and cultural construction have turned Lenin's immortal theory that backward countries can bypass the stage of capitalist development and move towards socialism with the proletariat assistance of the most advanced countries into a reality of human history.
    The Mongolian people are brave and peace-loving. Since the establishment of the people's regime, the Mongolian people have made many contributions to the cause of world peace and democracy. In 1939, with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the Mongolian people powerfully countered the provocations of Japanese imperialism on the Khalkhin Gol border. During World War II, the Mongolian People's Republic faithfully implemented the 1936 Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Treaty, vigorously supporting the Soviet people who were waging the Great Patriotic War; then, after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, it sent cavalry mechanized units to cooperate with the Soviet Red Army in giving a fatal blow to Japanese imperialism. When American imperialism launched an armed invasion of Korea, the Mongolian people provided the Korean people with moral and material support. In short, from the day of its birth, the Mongolian People's Republic has steadfastly struggled to defend the independence of its motherland and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
    The Chinese and Mongolian peoples, living as neighbors, have a long history of friendship. Although the exchanges between them have been interrupted for decades due to the instigation and alienation of imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries, the people of the two countries have continuously supported and encouraged each other with their own victories and struggles. In the revolutionary struggle, the Mongolian people won victory before our people. Their victory has always been warmly cheered and praised by our people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have also given great sympathy and support to the revolutionary struggle of our people. The Mongolian people fought alongside the Soviet Red Army to strike at Japanese imperialism, which was a great support to our people who were resisting Japanese imperialism at that time. All these facts prove that the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, based on Marxism-Leninism, has grown up in battle and is unbreakable.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the fraternal friendly relations between the two peoples entered a new era. The friendly relations between the two peoples in the political, economic, and cultural fields are growing day by day. In October 1952, during the visit of the Premier Tsedenbal of the Mongolian People's Republic to our country, the "Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement" was signed. As Premier Tsedenbal said: "The 'Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement' signed between our two countries in 1952 has played and is playing an extremely beneficial role for both of our countries. The friendly cooperation between our two countries is expanding and consolidating year by year." In July this year, our Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to visit the Mongolian People's Republic. This visit brought the close and solid friendship between China and Mongolia a step further.
    It should be particularly pointed out that our country, together with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, has agreed to build a railway from Jining in our country to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, and connect it with the railway from Ulaanbaatar to the Soviet Union. This railway, which symbolizes the eternal friendship between the people of the three countries, will not only shorten the geographical distance between us, but also greatly facilitate the mutual support between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, who are jointly building socialism with the assistance of the Soviet Union, thereby accelerating our common progress. This is of great significance for defending peace in Asia and the world.
    Today, as the Mongolian people jubilantly celebrate their great festival, we, with the same joy and excitement, congratulate the Mongolian People's Republic on the great achievements it has made since its founding, and sincerely hope that the Mongolian people will achieve greater achievements in realizing the second five-year plan and in building the cause of socialism, and make even more brilliant contributions in the great struggle to defend world peace.

### 蒙古人民光辉的三十年

    蒙古人民光辉的三十年
    十一月二十六日是蒙古人民光辉的日子。三十年前——一九二四年——的今天，蒙古大人民呼拉尔颁布了蒙古第一部宪法，宣告了蒙古人民共和国的成立。蒙古人民反对外国殖民者、反对国内世俗和寺院封建主的胜利，终于以立法的形式巩固了下来。从此，蒙古人民作了自己国家的主人，开始缔造人民民主制度的国家，创建自由幸福的新生活。无疑地，蒙古人民革命的胜利是有着重大国际意义的。
    几世纪以来，蒙古人民在帝国主义和封建主义的压迫下，辗转于痛苦和黑暗之中。伟大的十月社会主义革命的光芒照亮了蒙古人民斗争的道路，蒙古人民优秀的儿子苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山创建了蒙古人民革命党，并在一九二一年领导了人民的武装起义，取得了人民革命的辉煌胜利。蒙古人民共和国成立之后，蒙古人民革命党和蒙古人民共和国政府正确地领导着全国人民，在列宁、斯大林学说的指导下，在伟大的友邦苏联的兄弟般的援助下，进行了国家建设事业。今天，生气勃勃、精力充沛的蒙古人民，正以自己辛勤的劳动，克服了多世纪遗留下来的落后性，进行着建设社会主义的光荣事业。
    的确，三十余年来，蒙古人民共和国在蒙古人民革命党领导下所取得的成就是伟大的。由于正确地执行了发展和巩固畜牧业的社会主义成分、同时全面地支持和发展劳动牧民经济、限制和排挤资本主义因素这样的政策，由于采取了各种有效的措施，就使作为国民经济主要部门的畜牧业获得了极大的发展、提高了牲畜产品率。今年，牧民生产合作社的数目已增为一九四八年的两倍，社员人数增加了三倍。个体牧民、牧民生产合作社和国营牧场的牲畜头数，在第一个五年计划期间增加了百分之八点七。按照第二个五年计划指标，预期在一九五七年，全国牲畜将达到二千七百五十万头，按人口平均拥有的牲畜头数说，将居世界第一位。
    在人民革命胜利之后，蒙古才开始建立和发展工业，现在，在蒙古人民共和国广阔的草原上已出现了不少的现代化工业。一九五三年，工业总产值比一九四○年增加了百分之二百七十。在第二个五年计划期间，工业生产水平将再增加百分之四十六。随着工业的发展，蒙古新兴的工人阶级也日益壮大了。过去七年中工厂工人数目就已增加了一倍。
    随着经济建设的发展，蒙古人民的物质和文化生活水平也有了显著的提高。一九五四年的实际工资已比一九四七年增加了百分之四十六。今年上半年，所实行的牲畜产品义务交售制、减低工业品和食品价格、提高畜产品价格等措施，又使劳动人民直接得到了巨大的利益。
    革命以前的蒙古只有一所供官僚子弟读书的学校。革命胜利之初，绝大部分人民都是不识字的。现在，蒙古的国民教育和文化事业已有了广泛的发展。文盲已经基本上被消灭了，蒙古已有了自己的最高学府——蒙古国立乔巴山大学。电影、戏剧、文学、广播以及卫生保健事业等，都在随着经济的发展而发展着。
    蒙古人民共和国在经济和文化建设上的这些光辉灿烂的成就，已把列宁关于落后国家在最先进的国家的无产阶级援助下能够越过资本主义的发展阶段而走向社会主义的不朽的学说，变成了人类历史的现实。
    蒙古人民是勇敢而又热爱和平的。在人民政权建立之后，蒙古人民对于世界和平民主事业已作了许多贡献。一九三九年，蒙古人民曾在苏联红军援助下有力地打击了日本帝国主义在哈勒欣河边境的挑衅。第二次世界大战期间，蒙古人民共和国忠实地执行了一九三六年苏蒙互助协定，大力支援正在进行伟大卫国战争的苏联人民；接着，又在苏联对日本宣战后，派出骑兵机械化部队，配合苏联红军给予日本帝国主义以致命的打击。当美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜时，蒙古人民曾给予朝鲜人民以道义和物质的支援。总之，从它诞生的那一天起，蒙古人民共和国就坚定地为捍卫祖国的独立、保卫亚洲和世界的和平而斗争着。
    毗邻而居的中国人民和蒙古人民有着悠久的友谊。虽然数十年来由于帝国主义和中国反动派的挑拨离间，隔断了彼此间的来往，但两国人民却不断地以自己的胜利和斗争互相支援着、鼓舞着。在革命斗争中，蒙古人民先于我国人民获得胜利。他们的胜利一直受到在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的我国人民的热烈欢呼和赞扬。在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，蒙古人民对于我国人民的革命斗争也给予了极大的同情和支持。蒙古人民与苏联红军并肩作战，打击日本帝国主义，对于当时正在进行反抗日本帝国主义侵略的我国人民是一种莫大的支援。所有这些事实都证明：建立在马克思、列宁主义基础上的中蒙两国人民的友谊是在战斗中成长起来的，是牢不可破的。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，两国人民之间兄弟般的友谊关系步入了新时期。两国人民之间在政治、经济、文化方面的友好关系正与日俱增。一九五二年十月，在蒙古人民共和国泽登巴尔总理访问我国时，签订了“中蒙经济及文化合作协定”。正如泽登巴尔总理所说：“我们两国间在一九五二年签订的‘经济及文化合作协定’，已经起了并正在起着对我们两国都是极为有利的作用。我们两国的友好合作，正在一年比一年地扩大和巩固。”今年七月，我国周恩来总理应邀访问了蒙古人民共和国。这次访问使中蒙两国之间亲密牢固的友谊更向前发展了一步。
    应当特别指出的，是我国同苏联和蒙古人民共和国议定修筑从我国集宁通蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托的铁路，并同从乌兰巴托到苏联的铁路接轨。这条象征着三个国家人民之间的永恒的友谊的铁路修成后，不仅缩短我们之间的地理距离，而且将大大便利正在苏联援助下并肩建设社会主义的中蒙两国人民之间的互相支援，从而加快我们共同前进的脚步。这对于捍卫亚洲和世界和平上，是具有重大意义的。
    今天，当蒙古人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝自己的伟大节日的时候，我们怀着同样欢欣鼓舞的心情，来祝贺蒙古人民共和国建国以来所获得的伟大成就，并衷心地期望蒙古人民在实现第二个五年计划，在建设社会主义事业中取得更大的成就，在保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中作出更为光辉的贡献。
