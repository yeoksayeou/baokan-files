    Rapid Development of Credit Cooperative Organizations in Various Parts of Yunnan Province
    Since Yunnan Province held a provincial credit cooperation conference in July, credit cooperative organizations have developed rapidly in various regions. As of the end of October, the number of credit cooperatives throughout the province had increased from 600 to 3,425, with more than 1,727,000 members. They had absorbed 42.039 billion yuan in shares and deposits, and issued 35.498 billion yuan in loans. The number of members increased by 5.4 times, shares and deposits increased by 2.3 times, and the amount of loans accounted for about 50% of the bank loans during the same period. Now, credit cooperatives are established in every township in 36 counties, including Jiangchuan. Generally, the number of households participating in credit cooperatives in each township is about 80% of the eligible households, and in some cases reaches 90%.
    These credit cooperative organizations have made considerable achievements in absorbing idle funds in rural areas, supporting agricultural production, and combating usury. For example, in Jiangchuan County, 70% of the county's more than 1,500 mutual aid teams have received loan support from credit cooperatives, of which 177 mutual aid teams have signed deposit and loan contracts with 26 credit cooperatives. During the spring plowing season this year, usurers in Xipu Township, Yiliang County, took advantage of the difficulties some people had in production or life to engage in usurious activities. The township credit cooperative promptly loaned out 46.42 million yuan to help farmers overcome their difficulties, effectively curbing usurious activities. Before the establishment of credit cooperatives in Yongcheng Township in Huize County and Hezui Township in Hexi County, there were usurious activities. Now, such activities have been basically eliminated.
    At present, various regions have successively summarized the experience of establishing this batch of credit cooperatives, studied the work of consolidation, and are preparing to continue to complete the province's plan to develop credit cooperatives to 4,000 in this winter and next spring on this basis.

    云南省各地信用合作组织发展迅速
    云南省在七月间开过全省信用合作会议以后，各地大量发展了信用合作组织。到十月底止，全省信用合作社由六百个发展到三千四百二十五个，社员已经有一百七十二万七千多人，吸收股金、存款四百二十亿三千九百多万元，放款三百五十四亿九千八百多万元；计社员增加五点四倍，股金和存款增加二点三倍，放款数量约占同期银行贷款百分之五十左右。现在江川等三十六个县已经乡乡有社。各乡参加信用合作社的户数一般都在可入社户数的百分之八十左右，有的达到百分之九十。
    这些信用合作组织在吸收农村闲散资金，支持农业生产，打击高利贷活动等方面已经作出不少成绩。如江川县全县一千五百多个互助组中百分之七十都得到了信用合作社的贷款扶持，其中有一百七十七个互助组同二十六个信用合作社订立了存款和贷款合同。今年春耕期间，宜良县西浦乡有高利贷者趁部分群众生产或生活中有困难，进行高利贷活动，该乡信用合作社及时贷出四千六百四十二万元，帮助农民克服了困难，有力地制止了高利贷活动。会泽县永城乡、河西县河咀乡等地建立信用合作社以前，都有高利贷活动，现在这种活动已经基本上被消灭了。
    目前，各地已经先后总结了建立这一批信用合作社的经验，研究了巩固的工作，并准备在这一基础上，继续完成全省在今冬明春使信用合作社发展到四千个的计划。　（李有让）
