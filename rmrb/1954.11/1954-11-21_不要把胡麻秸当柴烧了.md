    Letter Summary:

    Don't Burn Flax Stalks as Firewood
    A letter from the office of the Yanbei Special District Office of the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative: Every year, many places across the country produce a lot of flax, especially the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi, the Zhangjiakou Special District of Hebei, and the Pingdiquan Administrative Region of Inner Mongolia. In the past, after farmers harvested the flax seeds, they burned the flax stalks as firewood, and no one thought that flax stalks could have great uses. In early September this year, the Ministry of Textile Industry sent people to the Yanbei Special District to conduct processing experiments on flax stalks. The flax stalks were first soaked in water, and then crushed with a millstone or machine. As a result, a lot of fiber could be produced. This fiber can be spun into yarn and woven into sacks or canvas. In order to prevent this useful thing from being wasted, the Ministry of Textile Industry and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have signed a contract with the Yanbei Special District Office of the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative for the purchase of flax fiber. County and grassroots cooperatives have organized processing and procurement. I suggest that all areas that produce large quantities of flax should pay attention to this issue and no longer burn flax stalks as firewood as in the past.

    不要把胡麻秸当柴烧了
    山西省供销合作社雁北专区办事处办公室来信：全国各地每年都要出产很多胡麻，尤其是山西的雁北专区、河北的张家口专区、内蒙的平地泉行政区出产的更多。过去农民们收了胡麻籽以后，就把胡麻秸当柴烧了，谁也没有想到胡麻秸还有很大用处。今年九月初，中央纺织工业部派人来雁北专区把胡麻秸作了加工试验，把胡麻秸先用水沤，再用碾子或机器把它压碎，结果能出很多纤维，这种纤维可以纺成纱，织成麻袋或帆布。为了不使这种有用的东西白白的浪费掉，纺织工业部和全国供销合作总社，已经同山西省供销社雁北专区办事处订了代购胡麻纤维的合同，各县社和基层供销社已经组织加工和收购。我建议凡是大量出产胡麻的地区，都应重视这个问题，再不要像过去一样，把胡麻秸当柴烧了。
