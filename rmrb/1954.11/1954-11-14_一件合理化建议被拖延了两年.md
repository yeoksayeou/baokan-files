Title: A Rationalization Proposal Delayed for Two Years

To the Editor:

　　I am a member of the Communist Youth League and a lathe worker in the Second Mechanical Workshop of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. I want to expose to the Party newspaper the fact that our leading comrades have delayed the final processing of one of my rationalization proposals for two years.

　　In August 1952, our factory launched a labor competition, and the workers actively sought tricks, tapped potentials, and improved production. However, the passenger car fitter group in our workshop, which was responsible for polishing passenger car parts, sometimes failed to complete its tasks because it used manual operation. I came up with a method of using a cloth grinding wheel instead of manual work, and drew a sketch together with its structural principles, and handed it over to the person in charge of the rationalization proposal committee in our workshop. After this suggestion was submitted, it disappeared.

　　Last year, when I went back to Shanghai for the "May Day" holiday, I saw a plating factory using a cloth grinding wheel instead of a file, so I borrowed one and brought it back to the factory and handed it over to the Youth League Committee. Later, the Youth League Committee handed it over to the Party Committee. The Party Committee handed it over to the Technical Improvement Section, which was responsible for the factory's rationalization proposals, for processing. The Technical Improvement Section then transferred the cloth grinding wheel to our workshop director, Wang Mingyuan, asking him to be responsible for the experiment. Because the experimental method was not correct and the effect was not good, Director Wang believed that my suggestion was useless. I requested the Party Committee to take the cloth grinding wheel to the Power Workshop for another experiment, and the Party Committee asked the Youth League Committee to take responsibility for it. Later, Comrade Liu Shixian of the Youth League Committee went with me and another worker to do the experiment again, and the result was very good, and the product inspection was qualified. We handed the written material of the experiment result to the workshop director Wang Mingyuan, asking him to forward it to the Technical Improvement Section. After approval by the Technical Improvement Section, the machine was installed and tested again in early November last year, proving that using a cloth grinding wheel polishing machine to grind copper parts could increase work efficiency by three times, and if grinding iron parts could increase efficiency by more than one time, and the product quality was also guaranteed. I thought that my rationalization proposal would soon be put into effect, but who knew that after more than half a year, the machine was still standing coldly in the corner of the workshop.

　　Why has such a suggestion been backlogged for two years? The reason is that neither the Technical Improvement Section nor the workshop is responsible for purchasing materials (cloth wheels and abrasive). (Editor's note: According to the investigation, the workshop should submit a form to the materials section to request it.) I ask the Party newspaper to support me in fighting against this bureaucratic phenomenon.

　　Report of the Newspaper Reporter's Investigation: It is true that the Second Mechanical Workshop of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory neglected the rationalization proposal of young turner Tang Guohua. According to our understanding, the fundamental reason is that the workshop leaders have a conservative and complacent ideology that is content with the status quo, satisfied with being able to barely complete the production tasks at present, and cannot see the need for work development. It is said that the reason given by the workshop leaders is: Tang Guohua's suggestion is not a key issue and has little effect. In fact, the Second Mechanical Workshop's handling of key issues is still not valued and not timely. On May 23rd this year, worker Wang Zhong proposed adding double tool holders to the double-sided bending plates of the planer's journal box, which could complete eight journal boxes at a time, increasing production efficiency by seven times (originally, only one piece could be planed at a time). This is a weak link in the workshop and a key issue. Unfortunately, this suggestion did not attract the attention and resolution of the workshop leaders.

　　The existence of the above situation is inseparable from the lack of in-depth and specific inspection by the Party and administrative leaders of the factory. The organization of the factory's rationalization proposal committee has long been a mere formality, and the Technical Improvement Section, which is responsible for leading rationalization proposals, is busy, lacks thoroughness, and has not had a clear division of labor with the workshop for a long time, and cannot adhere to the system, so some rationalization proposals are silently buried.

　　The leaders of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory must frequently educate all cadres (especially workshop cadres) to value and cherish the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers through arduous ideological labor.

### 一件合理化建议被拖延了两年

专栏：

　　一件合理化建议被拖延了两年编辑同志：
    我是一个青年团员，是唐山机车车辆修理厂第二机械车间的旋床工人。我要向党报揭发我们领导同志把我的一个合理化建议拖延了两年未作最后处理的事实。
    一九五二年八月，我们厂里展开了劳动竞赛，工人们都积极找窍门、挖潜力，提高生产。可是，我们车间负责客车零件的打光工作的客车钳工组因为是用手工操作，有时却完不成任务。我想出了用布砂轮代替手工的办法，并绘出一张草图，连同它的构造原理一起交给了我们车间合理化建议委员会的负责人。这个建议交上去以后，就没有下落。
    去年“五一”节我回上海去时，看到有一家电镀厂用布砂轮代替锉刀，于是就借了一个布砂轮，带回厂子交给团委会。后来团委会又把它交给党委会。党委交给负责厂里合理化建议工作的技术改进科处理。技术改进科就把布砂轮转交给我们的车间主任王明远，要他负责作试验。因为试验的方法不对头，效果不好，王主任就认为我的建议不中用。我要求党委会把布砂轮再拿到动力车间去试验一次，党委会要团委会负责办理。后来团委会柳世贤同志就同我和另一工人一起去再作试验，结果很好，产品检查合格。我们把试验结果的书面材料，交给车间主任王明远，请他转给技术改进科。经过技术改进科批准后，去年十一月初，才把机器安装起来又进行了一次验试，证明用布砂轮打光机打磨铜活可以使工作效率提高三倍，如果打磨铁活可以提高效率一倍以上，并且产品质量也有保证。我想这下我的合理化建议很快就会发挥作用了，谁知过了半年多，机器仍然冷冰冰地站在车间的角落里。
    为什么这样一个建议竟被积压了两年呢？原来是因为技术改进科和车间都不负责采购材料（布轮和磨砂）。（编者按：据调查按照规定应由车间具单向材料科请领。）我要求党报支持我向这种官僚主义的现象进行斗争。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　唐山机车车辆修理厂　汤国华
    本报记者的调查报告：唐山机车车辆修理厂第二机械车间忽视青年旋工汤国华的合理化建议的事情是真实的。据我们了解，其根本原因是车间领导上存在着安于现状的保守自满思想，满足于目前能够勉强完成生产任务，看不到工作发展的需要。据说车间领导方面的理由是：汤国华的建议不是关键性问题，作用不大。其实，第二机械车间对关建性问题的处理，也仍然是不重视、不及时的。今年五月二十三日，工人王仲提出把刨床轴箱守双面弯板加上双刀架，一次可刨完八块轴箱守，使生产效率提高七倍（原来一次只能刨一块）。这是车间的薄弱环节，是一个关键问题。可惜，这个建议并没有引起车间领导方面的注意和解决。
    上述情况的存在是同该厂党、行政领导缺乏深入具体的检查是分不开的。该厂合理化建议委员会的组织长期流于形式，负责领导合理化建议的技术改进科工作忙乱、不深入，长期来同车间没有明确的分工，不能坚持制度，因而有些合理化建议就无声无息地被埋没下去。
    唐山机车车辆修理厂领导方面必须经常地教育全厂干部（特别是车间干部），重视、爱护工人群众经过艰苦的思想劳动所提出的合理化建议。
