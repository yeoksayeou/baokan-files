Promoting Advanced Rice Farming Techniques and Increased Production Experience
Guangdong Province Organizes Agricultural Observation Group to Observe Chao-Shan Area

[This newspaper reports] The Chao'an and Shantou areas of Guangdong Province are among the regions in our country with relatively advanced rice farming techniques and relatively high yields per unit area. In order to promote the rice farming techniques and increased production experiences of the Chao-Shan area, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government organized a Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Observation Group to observe the Chao-Shan area. The observation group included farmer representatives from the central Guangdong, western Guangdong, and northern Guangdong regions, as well as representatives from relevant agencies. The observation group successively visited the large-scale high-yield rice, rice-bottom sweet potato, and diversified operations of demonstration farms and agricultural production cooperatives in the Chao-Shan area, as well as water conservancy construction, the improvement of mountain pit fields and the utilization of barren hills and wasteland for diversified operations, and animal husbandry production.

Before the observation, farmer representatives generally did not believe that the eastern Guangdong area had "thousand-catty districts" or "thousand-catty townships," and especially did not believe in high yields of 1,500 to 1,600 catties of grain per mu. After on-site observation, the representatives saw the fact of large-scale high-yield rice production with their own eyes. At the same time, they realized that the reasons for obtaining large-scale high yields were that, based on mutual aid and cooperation, they had built good water conservancy, cleared rice roots, and overcome natural disasters such as water, drought, and insects, and adopted a complete set of cultivation techniques of small clumps and dense planting, such as selecting good varieties, cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting, adding fertilizer and deep plowing, rational fertilization, and controlling irrigation and drainage. As a result, they overcame the conservative thinking of "production reaching its peak" and realized that their own regions still had great production potential. For example, Huang Laiyou, deputy director of the Red Lantern Agricultural Production Cooperative in Denglong Township, Zhongshan County, saw that the clump and row spacing of rice in the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Puning County was six inches each, while the clump and row spacing of rice in his own cooperative was as large as one foot and six inches, and he had not adopted techniques such as seed selection, phased topdressing, and phased irrigation and drainage. He realized that there were reasons why others obtained high yields. At the Demonstration Farm in Jieyang County, he learned that the sandy fields yielded more than 700 catties per mu in the early rice season this year, and could reach more than 800 catties in the late rice season. He said: "The soil quality of our sandy area is so good, it's really wasting it. If our farming techniques are as good as here, an annual yield of 2,000 catties per mu is guaranteed." In addition, the representatives saw the achievements of fully utilizing land resources, adapting to local conditions, and carrying out diversified operations, which increased their confidence in expanding the scale of agricultural production cooperatives in the future. In the Kui Tan mountainous area of Huilai County, the representatives saw that the slopes on both sides were planted with pineapples, lychees, persimmons, pears, plums and other fruit trees; at the Demonstration Farm in Jieyang County, the representatives saw sugarcane planted on barren hills. Everyone said that they would also use the barren hills after returning.

During the observation, the representatives saw that the areas with large-scale high yields and relatively successful diversified operations were also areas with a better foundation of mutual aid and cooperation. For example, in the Sixteenth District of Jieyang County, the average yield of rice per mu in the entire district is estimated to reach 1,127 catties this year. There are currently nine agricultural production cooperatives and 1,312 mutual aid groups in the entire district, with a total of 8,012 households, accounting for 60 percent of the total number of households in the district. The representatives further realized that the agricultural production increase campaign must be carried out with mutual aid and cooperation as the center, and realized that cooperativization is the basis and prerequisite for technological reform.

After returning to Guangzhou, the observation group made a summary. Many representatives have initially made plans to improve production techniques and carry out diversified operations in the future. Huang Laiyou, deputy director of the Red Lantern Agricultural Production Cooperative in Denglong Township, Zhongshan County, decided to mobilize the cooperative members to revise next year's production increase plan after returning, and it is estimated that more than 2.3 million catties of grain can be sold to the state.

    推广先进的水稻耕作技术和增产经验
    广东省组织农业观摩团到潮汕地区观摩
    【本报讯】广东省的潮安和汕头地区，是我国水稻耕作技术比较先进、单位面积产量比较高的地区之一。广东省人民政府为了推广潮汕地区的水稻耕作技术和增产经验，组织了广东省农业观摩团到潮汕地区观摩。参加观摩团的有粤中、粤西、粤北三个区的农民代表和各有关机关的代表。观摩团先后参观了潮汕地区示范农场和农业生产合作社的大面积丰产水稻、稻底番薯和多种经营情况、水利建设情况、改良山坑田和利用荒山荒地作多种经营的情况，以及畜牧生产情况。
    观摩前，农民代表普遍不相信粤东区有水稻“千斤区”、“千斤乡”，尤其不相信每亩田会有一千五、六百斤谷的高额产量。经过实地观摩，代表们亲眼看到了水稻大面积丰产的事实，同时认识到获得大面积丰产的原因，是在互助合作的基础上修好水利，挖清稻根，战胜了水、旱、虫等自然灾害，并采用了小科密植的整套栽培技术，如选用良种、培育壮秧、合理密植、加肥深耕、合理施肥、控制排灌水等，因而克服了“生产到顶”的保守思想，认识到自己地区仍有很大的生产潜力。如中山县灯笼乡红灯农业生产合作社副主任黄来有，在普宁县光明农业生产合作社看见禾科的科行距各六寸，而自己社里禾科的科行距则大至一尺六寸，又没有采用选种、分期追肥、分期排灌水等技术，才知道人家获得高额产量是有原因的；在揭阳县示范农场，他了解到沙质田今年早造每亩收七百多斤，晚造可达八百多斤。他说：“我们沙田区的土质那样好，实在屈死了它，如果我们的耕作技术像这里一样好，每亩每年产量两千斤也有保证。”此外，代表们看到当地充分利用地力，因地制宜，进行多种经营的成绩，提高了对今后扩大农业生产合作社的生产规模的信心。在惠来县葵潭山区，代表们看到山坡两旁种满了菠萝、荔枝、柿、梨、梅等果木；在揭阳县示范农场，代表们看到在荒山种植甘蔗。大家都表示回去后也要把荒山利用起来。
    代表们在观摩中，看到凡是大面积丰产、进行多种经营较有成绩的，都是互助合作基础也较好的地区。如揭阳县第十六区，全区水稻每亩平均产量，今年估计可达一千一百二十七斤。全区现有农业生产合作社九个，互助组一千三百一十二个，共八千零一十二户，占全区总户数的百分之六十。代表们进一步认识到必须以互助合作为中心开展农业增产运动，体会到合作化是技术改革的基础和前提。
    观摩团回到广州后，进行了总结。不少代表初步作出了今后改进生产技术、进行多种经营的计划。中山县灯笼乡红灯农业生产合作社副主任黄来有决定回去发动社员修改明年的增产计划，估计可卖给国家二百三十万斤以上的粮食。
