    Soviet Agricultural Experts in China
　  Hua Shu
    On the afternoon of October 31st, at the agricultural hall of the Soviet Exhibition in Beijing, a group of Young Pioneers surrounded a middle-aged farmer, listening to him tell the story of close planting of cotton. It turned out that these children were very interested in the large cotton plants displayed there, but the guide could not satisfy their series of questions. It happened that this fellow villager also came to visit, so he launched into a deep discussion of close planting. I clearly heard him raise his voice and say, "Our cooperative also plants more than 5,000 plants per mu, and we can harvest five or six hundred jin."

    This immediately reminded me of another matter in 1949. It was when the Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko gave a report, and the main audience were agricultural science and technology personnel. When Lysenko talked about the high yield of closely planted cotton in the Soviet Union, which, converted into Chinese units, could reach 1,200 to 1,800 jin per mu, many people suspected that the translation comrade had made a mistake. Because at that time, it was already rare to harvest three or four hundred jin of cotton per mu, and in terms of cultivation techniques, it had never been mentioned that close planting could increase production.

    The theory that was difficult for agricultural workers to accept five years ago has now become the production practice of an ordinary farmer. The assistance given to us by Soviet experts in the past five years has been so great and profound.

    Five years ago, when the first batch of tractors was shipped from the Soviet Union to Beijing, the number of people who knew how to drive them to the fields to cultivate was very limited. When rural propagandists talked to the villagers about agricultural mechanization, some people even said, "Cars need highways, trains need railways, how can tractors cultivate the land?"

    However, with the help of Soviet experts, today we have one hundred and eleven mechanized state farms and one hundred and thirteen machine tractor stations serving organized farmers. Not long ago, Soviet expert Trusov, after specifically understanding the work in some areas, excitedly stated: The shift work quotas achieved by many tractor drivers and the fuel consumption quotas per work unit, in terms of certain brands of tractors and certain types of work, already meet Soviet standards. For example, the tractor load of the Changzhi Tractor Station is 15 horsepower, bearing 408 hectares of land, which is almost the same as the tractor load standard in the southern and central Soviet Union, and the north has not yet reached this standard.

    In recent years, Soviet experts have also provided many unforgettable help in farmland water conservancy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and plant protection.

    Taking locust control work alone, and only taking the situation in Xinjiang in 1953 as an example, there were more than 40 Soviet experts (including agricultural experts, engineers and other relevant personnel) who helped us with the latest medicines and machinery (including 17 aircraft), in an area of more than 800,000 mu, to eliminate the breeding grounds of locusts that had bred for generations. As everyone knows, locusts, in Chinese history, are as serious and frequent a disaster as floods; however, today we have basically eliminated them. When Soviet experts worked in Xinjiang, it was by no means accidental that they were often greeted by mass rallies of tens of thousands of people in that sparsely populated area.

    Although the above-mentioned are only fragments of the work of Soviet agricultural experts in China in the past five years, it can already be seen how huge and far-reaching its influence is.

    In the past short five years, the reason why Soviet agricultural experts have been able to give us so much remarkable help is inseparable from their internationalist spirit and in-depth working style.

    Soviet agricultural experts worked for us under extremely difficult conditions. First of all, because agricultural production is greatly affected by natural conditions, they have little or no knowledge of many crops commonly cultivated in China; they have no knowledge of or have long eliminated many serious plant diseases and insect pests in China; and more importantly, their agricultural production has reached a high degree of mechanization and collectivization, and the scientific and technological applications under such conditions are obviously different from the actual requirements of China's agricultural production, which is dominated by the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, from Lysenko, the first chief advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture who came to China in 1949, to Balekin, who succeeded Lysenko and came to China in 1953, as well as dozens of Soviet experts who came to China one after another in the past five years, the first thing they did when they first arrived in China was to go to the countryside to deeply understand the situation, investigate and research.

    A. Ivanov is one of the famous Michurin scholars in the Soviet Union. He came to China mainly to impart the Michurin theory. However, before giving a formal lecture, he always demanded to conduct an investigation in Central South, East China, North China, and Northeast China first. Therefore, in his subsequent academic lectures, he was able to vividly quote China's local materials and gain the sincere love of the students.

    Soviet expert Obriensky, who came to China in 1954, is an excellent plant pathologist with a deep understanding of grape phylloxera. However, after he came to China, he never mentioned this issue. Later, it was not until he discovered grape phylloxera in Yantai and confirmed it that he took out the large amount of data he had prepared long ago when he gave a report in Qingdao and systematically introduced it to everyone.

    Soviet agricultural experts often go to the countryside, even after they are familiar with the situation in China, they still constantly go to various farms or rural areas, and never consider the quality of personal life. For our agricultural workers, through following the experts to the countryside, they can not only learn advanced science and technology, but also quickly improve in terms of thinking and working methods.

    There was such a thing: In 1953, the working group headed by Valinicha, in the Hubei and Sichuan area, investigated the growth of cold-resistant fruit trees - Yichang oranges, and after a long time, they could not get results. Once they suddenly heard that there was this variety on a certain mountain, which might meet the requirements of the investigation. The problem was that the transportation was too difficult and it was not easy to go. At this time, an old professor and two young cadres in the group bravely requested to be given this task. A week later, they brought back the physical specimens excitedly.

    After the experts looked at them one by one, they asked:

    --What are the climatic conditions there?

    --Oh, there is snow, the snow is very deep, about three inches or more. Unfortunately, there is no meteorological record.

    The experts thought carefully for a while and then asked:

    --So, what other plants are around it?

    This stumped our professor. He had been accustomed to conducting research in isolation for a long time! In his working methods and thinking methods, he thought that since the object of research was only Yichang oranges, then there were already specimens of Yichang oranges here, wasn't that enough? However, he forgot a law of Michurin's biological science: The growth of any plant is affected by the external environment.

    Yu Qibao, the head of the preparatory office of the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute, is one of the well-known cotton crop scholars in China. After working with Soviet expert Titov, who guided the large-scale cotton production in the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang, he said with emotion: "Generally, Chinese experts can only solve one or two 'whys' in specific field work, while Professor Titov can solve a series of 'whys'. We are really too poor in the depth of studying technology." Soviet experts also enlightened and helped our agricultural workers through their practical actions in this way.

    It is worth noting that while helping us learn advanced science and technology, Soviet experts also constantly encourage us to summarize and improve China's inherent technical experience. When the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation visited the Soviet Union in 1953, Academician Lysenko suggested that Chinese biologists should attach importance to the summary of farmers' experience. He believed that "the biological knowledge of the Chinese people, if summarized, will definitely be much richer than the knowledge in existing biological books." On the eve of his return home after his term of office, Lysenko repeatedly encouraged us: "Chinese agricultural technicians should create a set of agricultural techniques for New China." Not long ago, Balekin more specifically suggested to us at the National Agricultural Science and Technology Conference: Establish comprehensive agricultural experiment stations throughout the country to conduct surveys and experiments on local agricultural production, so as to study a set of agricultural technology reform measures that are practically feasible in the local area, such as crop rotation and which crops are suitable for local cultivation.

    In the spring of 1953, A. Ivanov organized the "Michurin Agricultural Plant Breeding and Seed Breeding Training Class" for us. This was the first time that Michurin's seeds were formally sown on the land of China. In the past two years, various major regions and some provinces across the country have successively opened such training classes, and more than 1,300 agricultural technicians have directly received this formal training. And the five kinds of lecture notes of the Michurin lecture class personally compiled by A. Ivanov were distributed more than 150,000 copies within one year, creating the highest record for the distribution of Chinese agricultural science publications.

    We know that Michurin's theory is the specific application of Marxism-Leninism in biological science. The agricultural workers of New China, with the help of Soviet experts with a high degree of internationalist spirit, are beginning to use the weapon of Michurin's theory to carry out the historical work of summarizing and improving farmers' experience. It can be affirmed that this work will achieve brilliant achievements with the unfolding of the socialist transformation movement of agriculture.

    苏联农业专家在中国
　  华恕
    十月三十一日下午，在北京苏联展览会的农业馆，有一群少年先锋队员，围着个中年农民，听他讲棉花密植的故事。原来这些小朋友对那儿所陈列的大棉棵，很感兴趣，可是讲解员又无法满足他们一连串提出的问题，刚巧碰到这位老乡也来参观，便深耕密植地扯开了。我清晰地听见他提高了嗓子在说：“咱们社也是一亩种五千多棵，能收上五、六百斤了。”
    这使我立刻联想起一九四九年的另一回事来。那是苏联农业专家卢森科作报告，主要的听众都是农业科学技术人员。当卢森科讲到苏联密植棉花的高产量，折合中国单位，一亩可达一千二百斤到一千八百斤时，许多人都怀疑是翻译同志给弄错了。因为当时一亩能收三、四百斤花的，已不可多得，而在栽培技术上，更从没提到过密植可以增产。
    五年前为农业工作者们还难于接受的理论，今天已成为一个普通农民的生产实践。五年来苏联专家给我们的帮助，是这样的巨大而深厚。
    五年前，当第一批拖拉机已从苏联运到北京的时候，懂得驾驶着它到田间去耕作的人，还有限得很；当农村宣传员给老乡们讲农业机械化的时候，有的人还说什么“汽车要有公路，火车要有铁道，拖拉机还能耕地？”
    但是，在苏联专家的帮助下，今天我们已经有了一百一十一个机械化的国营农场，一百一十三个为组织起来的农民服务的机器拖拉机站。不久以前，苏联专家特鲁索夫在具体了解了一些地区的工作之后，兴奋地表示：有许多拖拉机手所达到的班次工作定额，和一个工作单位所消耗的燃油定额，在某些牌号的拖拉机及某些工作种类方面，已经符合于苏联的标准了。比如长治拖拉机站的拖拉机负荷十五马力，负担四百○八公顷土地，这几乎同苏联南部和中部拖拉机的负荷标准一样，而北部还达不到这个标准。
    几年来，苏联专家在农田水利、畜牧兽医、植物保护等方面，也给了许多令人难忘的帮助。
    仅仅以治蝗工作来说，也仅仅以一九五三年在新疆这一个地区的情况来说，就有四十多位苏联专家（包括农业专家、工程师及其他有关人员），帮助我们以最新的药械（包括十七架飞机），在八十万亩以上的大面积上，扑灭了滋生了多少世代的蝗虫的巢穴。大家知道，蝗虫在中国历史上，是和洪水一样严重而频繁的灾害；可是，今天我们已把它基本上消灭了。苏联专家在新疆工作的时候，能够经常在那人口稀少的地区，常常受到几万人的大会欢迎，决不是偶然的。
    虽然上面所列举的，只是苏联农业专家在中国五年来工作的片断，但已可以看出它的影响的巨大和深远。
    在过去短短的五年间，苏联农业专家所以能够给我们许多成绩显著的帮助，这是和他们的国际主义精神和深入的工作作风分不开的。
    苏联农业专家是在极其困难的条件下为我们工作的。首先因为农业生产受自然条件的影响很大，有许多中国普遍栽培的庄稼，他们根本没有或者很少；有许多中国十分严重的植物病虫害，他们没有或者早被消灭；而更重要的是他们的农业生产，已达到高度的机械化和集体化，在那样的条件下所运用的科学技术，和小农经济占优势的中国农业生产的实际要求，是有着显然的距离的。因此，从一九四九年第一个来华担任农业部首席顾问的卢森科和继卢森科在一九五三年来华的巴列金，以及五年来先后来华的几十位苏联专家，他们在最初到达中国的时候，头一件事就是到各地农村去深入地了解情况，调查研究。
    阿·伊凡诺夫是苏联有名的米丘林学者之一。他到中国来，主要也就是传授米丘林学说。但是，在正式讲课之前，他一定要求先去中南、华东、华北、东北等地进行一次调查。因此，在他后来所作的学术讲演中，就能够那么生动地引用中国的实地材料，而获得学员们衷心的爱戴。
    一九五四年来华的苏联专家奥卜连斯基，是一位优秀的植物病理学家，他对葡萄根瘤蚜有着高深的研究。可是，他来到中国以后，从不谈及这个问题。后来，直到他在烟台发现了葡萄根瘤蚜，并经过了断定，这才在青岛作报告时，把那早已准备的大批资料拿出来，系统地介绍给大家。
    苏联农业专家是经常下乡的，即使在熟悉了中国情况之后，也还是不断地到各农场或各地农村去，而从不考虑个人生活的好坏。这对于我们的农业工作者来说，通过跟随专家下乡的工作，不但能学习先进的科学技术，而且在思想上和工作方法上，也能很快地提高。
    有过这么一件事：一九五三年，以华林尼差为首的工作团，在湖北、四川一带，调查耐寒果树——宜昌橙的生长情况，许久得不到结果，有一次忽然听说某处山上有这个品种，可能符合调查的要求。问题是交通太困难，不容易去。这时，随团的一位老教授和两个青年干部，勇敢地要求给予他们以这个任务。一星期后，他们兴冲冲地把实物标本带回来了。
    专家一一看过后就问：
    ——那儿的气候条件怎么样？
    ——哦，有雪，雪很深，大约三寸多。可惜没有测候记载。
    专家细细地想了一回，又问：
    ——那么，在它周围的还有些什么植物呢？
    这可把我们的教授难住了。他是长时期习惯于孤立地进行研究的啊！在他工作方法和思想方法上，以为既然要研究的只是宜昌橙，那么，这里已经有了宜昌橙的标本，还不足够了吗？然而，他却忘记了米丘林生物科学的一条规律：任何植物的生长，都是受着外界环境的影响的。
    西北农业科学研究所筹备主任俞启葆，是国内有名的棉作学者之一。他和指导新疆玛纳斯河流域大面积棉花丰产的苏联专家提托夫，在一起工作了一些时间之后，感慨地说：“一般中国的专家，在具体的田间工作上，顶多只能解决一两个‘为什么’，而提托夫教授，却能解决一系列的‘为什么’，我们对钻研技术的深入性实在是太差了。”苏联专家又是这样地通过他的实际行动，来启发和帮助我们的农业工作者的。
    值得注意的是苏联专家在帮助我们学习先进的科学技术的同时，又不断地鼓励我们总结和提高中国固有的技术经验。一九五三年中国科学院代表团赴苏访问时，李森科院士曾建议中国生物学者，应当重视对农民经验的总结，他认为：“中国人民中的生物学知识，如果总结出来，一定会比现有生物学书籍上的知识丰富得多。”卢森科在任满归国的前夕，还一再地鼓励我们：“中国的农业技术人员，应该创造一套新中国的农业技术。”不久以前，巴列金在全国农业科学技术会议上，更具体地向我们建议：在全国各地建立综合性的农业试验站，进行各当地农业生产的调查试验，从而研究出一套在当地切实可行的农业技术改革的措施，如作物换茬以及哪一些作物适合于当地的栽培等。
    一九五三年春天，阿·伊凡诺夫为我们主办了“米丘林农业植物选种及良种繁育训练班”，这是第一次在中国的土地上，正规地播下了米丘林的种子。两年来，全国各个大区和有的省，又先后接着开办了这样的训练班，有一千三百多农业技术人员，直接受到了这一正规的训练。而阿·伊凡诺夫亲自主编的米丘林讲习班的五种讲义，在一年之内，即发行了一十五万多份，创造了中国农业科学出版物发行的最高纪录。
    我们知道，米丘林学说就是马克思列宁主义在生物科学上的具体运用。新中国的农业工作者们，在具有高度国际主义精神的苏联专家的帮助下，正在开始以米丘林学说的武器，进行总结和提高农民经验的历史性的工作。可以肯定，这一工作，将随着农业的社会主义改造运动的展开，获得光辉灿烂的成就。
