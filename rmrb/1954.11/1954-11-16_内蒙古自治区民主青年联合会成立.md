Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 15th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Democratic Youth Federation has been formally established. The first Youth Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was held in Hohhot City from November 5th to 10th. One hundred and forty-nine youth representatives from the Mongolian, Han, Manchu, Hui, Tibetan, Korean, and Oroqen ethnic groups attended the congress. At the meeting, fifty-one members of the first executive committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Democratic Youth Federation were elected. The executive committee then elected Ulgijinaren (Mongolian) as chairman, and Kong Shizhen and three others as vice-chairmen.

    The meeting reviewed and summarized the youth work since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the past seven years, young people of all ethnic groups have played a significant role in promoting national regional autonomy and various construction endeavors. More than 800,000 young people have participated in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral construction. In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia alone, more than 10,000 senior primary school graduates participated in agricultural production in 1954. Mongolian youth labor model and tractor driver Wu En created a record by hauling 215 cubic meters of timber per trip with a single tractor. In pastoral areas, according to statistics from five banners, including Hangjin and Junwang in the Ikezhao League, young people serve as heads of pastoral mutual aid teams. In the New Barag Right Banner of the Hulunbuir League, Jingge, a Mongolian youth model worker in animal husbandry, led a year-round mutual aid team that rationally used labor and made adequate preparations for winter, resulting in continuous increases in the number of livestock for the team members. During the snowstorms in the spring of this year, the team did not lose a single one of its 1,800 livestock, and the livestock breeding rate reached 97.2%.

    The meeting determined that the Inner Mongolia Democratic Youth Federation should, under the leadership of the Communist Party, and with the Chinese New Democratic Youth League as its core, broadly unite and educate young people of all ethnic groups and strata to build the motherland and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
