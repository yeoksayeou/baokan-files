    Letter from the Tang Ruifu Group of Steel Plant 102 to Soviet Workers

    Dear Soviet Worker Comrades:

    The 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution has arrived. All comrades of our group celebrate this common festival of the working people of the world with unparalleled joy, and we wholeheartedly congratulate our Big Brothers.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the kind assistance of Soviet experts, China's steel production has greatly developed. The total output value of our state-owned Steel Plant 102 this year has increased more than twelve times compared to 1950. Soviet experts helped us to increase the volume of electric furnaces, doubling the output of electric furnace steel. In 1954, our electric furnace steel production has increased more than eleven times compared to 1950, and the quality has gradually increased from over thirty percent to over ninety-eight percent. Last year, our group resolutely implemented the advanced experiences suggested by Soviet experts Gimmidov and Zhuyev, such as "high-temperature boiling," "high-temperature furnace patching," "batch addition of iron ore," "automatic slag tapping," and "rapid dephosphorization," which increased production and saved 20.8 billion yuan of wealth for the motherland. This year, Soviet experts Marshchev and others have solved the key problem of "white spots" that have long existed in steel, greatly improving the quality of steel, and at the same time correspondingly improving our steelmaking technology. We deeply realize that without the assistance of our Soviet Big Brothers, there would be no such brilliant achievements.

    In order to thank our Soviet Big Brothers for their assistance, and in order to live up to the expectations of our Big Brothers, we must honestly and diligently learn from our Big Brothers, resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and produce in accordance with the technical operating procedures formulated by the experts, to produce more and better steel for the motherland, and build our country into a great socialist country as soon as possible.

    With the highest respect!

    Tang Ruifu Advanced Group of Steelmaking Workshop, Chongqing State-owned Steel Plant 102

    一零二钢铁厂唐瑞福小组给苏联工人的信亲爱的苏联工人同志：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年纪念日来到了。我们小组的全体同志以无比欢快的心情来庆祝这个全世界劳动人民共同的节日，我们衷心地向老大哥们祝贺。
    最近几年来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在苏联专家的亲切帮助下，我国的钢铁生产有了很大的发展。我们国营一零二钢铁厂的生产总值，今年就比一九五零年增长了十二倍以上。苏联专家帮助我们改大电炉容积，使电炉钢的产量增加一倍。一九五四年我们炼的电炉钢，已比一九五零年增长了十一倍多，质量由百分之三十几逐步提高到百分之九十八以上。去年我们小组坚决贯彻了苏联专家吉米多夫、朱也夫等同志建议的“高温沸腾”、
  “高温补炉”、“分批加铁矿”、“自动流渣”、“快速去高磷”等先进经验后，为祖国增产节约了二百零八亿元的财富。今年，苏联专家马尔歇夫等同志又为我们解决了钢中长期存在“白点”的关键问题，大大提高了钢的质量，同时使我们的炼钢技术也相应地得到提高。我们深切地认识到，没有苏联老大哥的援助，就不会有这样的光辉成就。
    为了感激苏联老大哥的援助，为了不辜负老大哥们的期望，我们要老老实实、勤勤恳恳地向老大哥们学习，坚决贯彻苏联专家的建议，遵照专家制订的技术操作规程生产，为祖国炼出更多更好的钢，早日把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。
    致以崇高的敬意！
    重庆国营一零二钢铁厂炼钢车间唐瑞福先进小组
