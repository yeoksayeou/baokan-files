A Vanguard Force on the Industrial Construction Front
    ——The No. 241 Geological Exploration Team Living on the Grasslands

    With the large-scale development of the motherland's economic construction, the Geological Department's No. 241 Geological Exploration Team and their exploration work on the Inner Mongolia grasslands have greatly developed. The number of workers and cadres has increased, and the mining areas have also expanded. Many new institutions such as tunnel exploration teams, geophysical prospecting teams, mining area geological teams, hydrogeological teams, geological survey teams, surveying teams, laboratories, and ore crushing rooms have been established successively. The No. 241 Geological Exploration Team has become a powerful vanguard force on the industrial construction front.  The photos in this issue, except for those with signatures, are all by Tie Mao, China Youth Daily.

    After the exploration team's exploration, many factories and mines will be built. In order to solve the water supply problem for the factories and mines, the hydrogeological team began water source exploration work in September last year. These team members are measuring the flow rate of water at a hot spring area outside a certain mining area.
    
    This modern geophysical prospecting team possesses a variety of prospecting instruments. These team members are moving the torsion balance instrument to a new measuring point for gravity measurement.
    
    The exploration team has trained a large number of exploration workers for the country. These two female drillers from the Prospecting Engineering Technical School are learning operating techniques under the guidance of technicians.
    
    Well exploration workers are preparing to go down the well to work. The underground treasures of the motherland attract them to enter the heart of the earth.  *Nationalities Pictorial*  Photo by Zhuang Xueben

    These two young women are concentrating on conducting chemical analysis in a well-equipped laboratory.
    
    On a Communist Youth League Day, young people who have dedicated their youth to the motherland's resource exploration事业gathered together to listen to poetry recitations.  *Nationalities Pictorial* Photo by Zhuang Xueben
    
    Playing volleyball in the evening breeze of the grasslands is one of the most interesting sports activities for the team members.
    
    The exploration team also discovered a quartzite deposit in the mining area that can be used as a refractory material. Exploration work has already begun. This is the team members carrying out drilling work for trench exploration.

    工业建设战线上的一支尖兵
    ——生活在草原上的二四一地质勘探队
    随着祖国经济建设大规模的开展，在内蒙古草原上的地质部二四一地质勘探队和他们的勘探工作，有了很大的发展，工人和干部增多了，矿区也扩大了，不少新的机构像洞探队、物理探矿队、矿区地质队、水文地质队、地质普查队、测绘队、化验室、碎矿室等相继建立起来了。二四一地质勘探队已经成为工业建设战线上一支强大的尖兵队伍。　本期照片除署名者外均为中国青年报　铁矛摄

    探队勘探过后，将要建立许多厂矿。为了解决厂矿的供水问题，水文地质队从去年九月就开始了水源勘测工作。这些队员在某矿区以外的温泉地方测验水的流速。
    这一支近代化的物理探矿队，拥有多种探矿仪器。这些队员将扭秤仪器搬到新的测点上进行重力测量。
    勘探队已经为国家培养了大批勘探工作者。这两个从探矿工程技工学校来的女钻工，正在技工的指导下学习操作技术。
    井探工作人员准备下井工作。祖国的地下宝藏吸引着他们走入大地的心脏。   民族画报　庄学本摄

    这两个年青的姑娘在设备相当齐全的化验室里正聚精会神地在进行化验。
    在一个团日里，把青春献给祖国资源勘探事业的青年们围聚在一起，听诗歌朗诵。  民族画报　庄学本摄
    在草原的晚风中打排球，是队员们最感兴趣的一种体育运动。
    勘探队在矿区还发现了一个作耐火材料的石英岩矿床，勘探工作早已开始进行了。这是队员们在进行槽探的打眼工作。
