Fujian Province's 8.3 million mu of single-season late rice has been basically harvested by early November, and yields are generally more than 5% higher than last year. According to estimates from the Longyan Special District, the average yield of the district's 550,000 mu of single-season rice can be increased by 5%, with Longyan, Shanghang, and Wuping counties increasing by 6% to 10%. In the Fu'an Special District, counties such as Xiapu, Fuding, Zhouning, Shouning, and Zherong all saw increases of more than 10%.

The yields of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are higher than those of general farmers. According to a survey in the Seventh District of Yong'an County: the Xin Canghai Agricultural Production Cooperative harvested 146 mu, with an actual yield of 52,200 jin of rice, an increase of 18% compared to last year; temporary mutual aid groups and individual farmers only increased by about 2% compared to last year.

During the autumn harvest, all regions paid attention to improving harvesting methods. In many areas, not only were harvesting tools added and improved, but also "careful harvesting and threshing, more threshing and turning" were done to make a final effort to increase the yield of late rice. According to a survey in Nanping Special District, more than 80% of the areas have improved harvesting methods to varying degrees. In the autumn harvest in Shaxian County, 960,000 jin of grain were harvested more through improving harvesting methods, of which 80,000 jin were harvested from turning over rice straw alone.

    福建省八百多万亩单季晚稻普遍增产
    福建省八百三十万亩单季晚稻，十一月上旬已基本收割完毕，一般都比去年增产了百分之五以上。据龙岩专区估计，全区五十五万亩单季稻平均可增产百分之五，其中龙岩、上杭、武平三县可增产百分之六至十。福安专区的霞浦、福鼎、周宁、寿宁、柘荣等县，增产都在一成以上。
    各地农业生产合作社的产量比一般农民都高。据永安县七区调查：新沧海农业生产合作社收割了一百四十六亩，实产稻谷五万二千二百斤，较去年增产百分之十八；临时互助组和单干农民只比去年增产百分之二左右。
    秋收中，各地都注意到改进收割方法，许多地区，不仅添置和改进了收割工具，而且做到“细收细打，多打多翻”，尽最后努力来提高晚稻收获量。据南平专区调查，有百分之八十以上的地区都在不同程度上改进了收割方法。沙县秋收中在改进收割方法上已经多收粮食九十六万斤，其中仅翻打稻草一项就多收粮食八万斤。
