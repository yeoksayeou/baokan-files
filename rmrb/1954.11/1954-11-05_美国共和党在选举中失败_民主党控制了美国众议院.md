Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th: According to TASS, preliminary results of the election held on November 2nd demonstrate that the ruling Republican Party has failed in the election. According to incomplete materials released at 11:15 PM New York time, Democratic candidates have won 219 seats in the House of Representatives. Republicans have won 179 seats. The results of the House of Representatives elections in another thirty-seven districts have not yet been determined. It appears that the Democratic Party has already obtained a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, thus gaining control of the United States Congress's House of Representatives. The final distribution of Senate seats has not yet been determined. According to available incomplete materials, the Democratic Party holds 46 seats, the Republican Party holds 45 seats, and one seat belongs to Morse, an independent member of Oregon. He stated before the election that he would side with the Democratic senators when voting. The voting results for the remaining four seats have not yet been counted.

In the previous session, the 83rd Congress, the seat distribution was as follows: 49 Republican seats, 46 Democratic seats, and 1 independent seat in the Senate. 219 Republican seats, 215 Democratic seats, and 1 independent seat in the House of Representatives.

Gubernatorial elections were held in thirty-four states, with Democratic candidates elected in eighteen states, Republican candidates elected in twelve states, and the election results in the remaining four states are currently unknown.

The new Congress will take office in January 1955.

It is worth noting that Senator Ferguson, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, who received special support from President Eisenhower during the election, suffered defeat in Michigan. The Associated Press wrote that Ferguson's defeat is a typical example of a trend that has also led to Democratic victories in Senate elections in Kentucky and Nevada.

According to available incomplete materials, Republicans have suffered the greatest defeats in industrial states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Connecticut, and New Jersey, where unemployment has generally increased, prices have continued to rise, and the situation of workers has deteriorated. In the metallurgical district of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and the coal mining areas of this state, where hundreds of thousands of workers are unemployed, the Republican Party failed to win the gubernatorial election in this state for the first time in the last twenty years. Unemployment is particularly severe in the textile, shoemaking, and other industrial centers of New England states, and the Republican Party has also suffered great defeats in these states.

    美国共和党在选举中失败
    民主党控制了美国众议院
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约三日讯：十一月二日举行的选举的初步统计结果证明，当权的共和党在选举中是失败了。根据纽约时间十一时十五分公布的不完全的材料，民主党候选人在众议院得到了二百一十九席。共和党得到一百七十九席。还有三十七个选区的众议员的选举结果没有确定。由此看来，民主党已经在众议院中得到过半数的席位，因而握有对美国国会众议院的控制权。参议院席位的最后分配还没有确定。根据现有的不完全材料看，民主党占四十六席，共和党占四十五席，还有一席属于俄勒冈州的无党派议员莫尔斯。他在选举前曾表示，他在表决时将和民主党参议员站在一边。其余四个席位的投票结果还没有统计出来。
    在前一届，即第八十三届国会中，席位的分配情况如下：参议院中共和党是四十九席，民主党是四十六席，无党派一席。众议院中共和党是二百一十九席，民主党是二百一十五席，无党派一席。
    三十四个州中举行了州长选举，十八个州选举了民主党的候选人，十二个州选举了共和党的候选人，其余四个州的选举结果现在还不知道。
    新的国会将在一九五五年一月就职。
    值得注意的是，在选举时期受到艾森豪威尔总统特别支持的参议院共和党政策委员会主席福格逊，在密执安州遭受失败。美联社写道，福格逊的失败是一个典型例子，说明了一种潮流，这种潮流使得民主党在肯塔基州和内华达州的参议员选举中也得到了胜利。
    根据现有不完全的材料，共和党人在像宾夕法尼亚、密执安、康涅狄格和新泽西这样一些工业州遭到了最大的失败，在这些州里，失业人数普遍增加，物价不断上涨，工人处境日益恶化。在宾夕法尼亚州的冶金区匹兹堡和这个州里的煤矿区，有几十万工人失业，共和党人在最近二十年中，第一次在这个州竞选州长失败。在新英格兰各州的纺织、制鞋业和其他工业中心，失业现象特别严重，在这些州，共和党也遭到了极大的失败。
