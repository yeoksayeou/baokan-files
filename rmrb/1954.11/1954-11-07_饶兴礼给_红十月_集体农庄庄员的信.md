Rao Xingli's Letter to the Members of the "Red October" Collective Farm

To all comrade members of the "Red October" Collective Farm in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR:

    In 1952, I had the opportunity to join the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to the great Soviet Union and witnessed firsthand your communist construction and the great achievements you have made. As the thirty-seventh anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution approaches, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and share with you the changes that have taken place in our agricultural producers' cooperative over the past two years.

    Do you remember? In 1952, when I visited your farm, I told you that our rural land reform had just ended, and our village had just organized an agricultural producers' cooperative with twelve households. After returning from my visit to the Soviet Union, I told everyone what I had seen with my own eyes. Everyone said, "The Soviet countryside is so good, we must catch up!" Our cooperative grew to sixty-nine households by 1954. Now, the autumn crops are on the market again, and our income is much better than that of individual farmers. Many farmers are asking to join the cooperative. In our Wangxiang Township, with more than 500 households, 70 percent of the farmers have joined the cooperatives. What a great transformation! For thousands of years, farmers have only been accustomed to individual production, but now they are beginning to engage in cooperative production in groups.

    Our agricultural producers' cooperative is developing rapidly. In 1952, our cooperative had only one new-style walking plow and two sprayers. This year, we can use water pumps for irrigation and pesticides to control insects. Chemical fertilizers have been applied to the fields. This year's winter plowing is being done with double-wheeled, double-furrow plows manufactured in our country based on Soviet-made animal-drawn farm implements. The industrial products available for daily life are also increasing. In the past, we wore straw sandals or went barefoot in the rain and snow, but now we wear rubber shoes. We used to use clay pots to hold water, but now we use thermos bottles. Everyone has many sets of fine cloth clothes. The cooperative members feel that they are on the right track by following the path of the Soviet farmers, and this is also a benefit brought about by the Soviet Union's assistance in our industrial construction.

    Dear Comrades, you know that it has only been five years since our rural areas were liberated from the reactionary rule and the exploitation of the landlord class. The changes in these five years have surpassed the changes of the past thousands of years. You must know that our country recently held the National People's Congress, passed the first people's constitution in our country's history, and elected our national leaders. Our beloved Comrade Mao Zedong was elected as the Chairman of the People's Republic of China. This major event has made us even more excited and inspired. In the future, we are determined to further learn from you, run agricultural producers' cooperatives well, increase production, and support the country's socialist construction.

    Dear Comrades, please accept our sincere gratitude! Let us work together for world peace and for the construction of our common goals!

    Rao Xingli, Chairman of the Wangxiang Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, Xishui County, Hubei Province

### 饶兴礼给“红十月”集体农庄庄员的信

    饶兴礼给“红十月”集体农庄庄员的信苏联阿塞拜疆加盟共和国“红十月”集体农庄全体庄员同志：
    我曾经在一九五二年参加中国农民代表团到过伟大的苏联，亲眼看到你们进行共产主义建设，并获得了伟大成就。当十月社会主义革命三十七周年到来的时候，我谨向你们致以衷心的祝贺，并把这两年来我们农业生产合作社变化的情况告诉给你们。
    还记得吗？一九五二年，我在你们农庄参观学习时，我曾经告诉过你们，我们农村土地改革才结束，我们乡才组织起一个十二户的农业生产合作社。我在苏联参观回来后，把我亲眼看到的事实告诉大家，大家说，苏联农村那样好，我们也要赶上去啊！我们合作社到一九五四年就发展到六十九户。现在，秋季作物又上场了，我们收入又比单干农民强了许多。许多农民要求入社。我们五百多户的望城乡，已有百分之七十的农民都入社了。这是多大的一个转变啊！农民千百年来，只习惯一家一户单人独马的生产，现在，开始变为成群结队的合作生产了。
    我们的农业生产合作社正在日益向前发展。一九五二年，我们全社只有一部新式步犁，两部喷雾器。今年呢，我们已能用抽水机灌溉，用药械除虫。田里施用了化学肥料。今年冬耕，是用的我国仿照苏联马拉农具制造的双轮双铧犁。生活用的工业品也越来越多了。过去天雨落雪，穿草鞋或打赤脚，现在穿胶鞋；过去用泥罐子装水，现在用热水瓶了。人人都有好多套细布衣服了。社员们感到，这是顺着苏联农民的路走对了，也是苏联帮助我们建设工业所带来的好处。
    亲爱的同志们：你们知道，我们农村从反动统治和地主阶级的压榨下解放过来才五年啊，五年来的变化，超越了过去千百年来的变化。你们一定知道，我们国家最近召开了全国人民代表大会会议，通过了我国有史以来第一个人民的宪法，选举了我们国家领导人员，我们敬爱的毛泽东同志当选为中华人民共和国主席。这件大事，使我们更加兴奋鼓舞，今后，我们决心进一步向你们学习，办好农业生产合作社，提高产量，支援国家社会主义建设。
    亲爱的同志们：请你们接受我们真诚的感谢吧！让我们共同为世界持久和平，为我们共同目标的建设事业努力吧！
    湖北省浠水县望城乡农业生产合作社社长  饶兴礼
