    Refuting the U.S. Smear of "Forced Labor" in Our Country
    Recently, under the instigation of the United States, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented a document to the delegations of various countries attending the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to use our government's "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Labor Reform" as a basis to smear our country as practicing "forced labor." The United States' use of this trick did not begin today. Since 1947, the United States has continuously used various UN conferences to slander the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries for practicing "forced labor," attempting to weaken the growing prestige of these countries among the world's people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States instructed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's representatives and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to carry out this despicable slander against our country. Now, the United States actually says that our country's labor reform regulations for criminals are "evidence" of so-called "forced labor" in China, and wants the United Nations General Assembly to discuss it. This is truly absurd.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the working people became the masters of the country. The fruits of labor belong to the laborers themselves. Our constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to work, and workers have the right to rest and to receive material assistance in old age, sickness, or loss of working ability. Our constitution also stipulates that the state shall take various measures to ensure that citizens and workers enjoy these rights. The broad masses of working people have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their work; they have received great assistance from the state in all aspects of employment, labor insurance, wages, welfare, health, recuperation, and cultural education. In our country, labor has become a glorious thing for all citizens with the ability to work. As for those criminals who endanger the interests of the country and the people, our country adopts a policy of labor reform, so that criminals can develop labor habits, learn production skills, and improve their culture during their period of supervision. In this way, criminals can become new people who can contribute to society after serving their sentences. These labor reform measures have nothing in common with so-called forced labor. The United States' use of our country's implementation of labor reform for criminals as evidence that our country practices "forced labor" is a malicious distortion aimed at confusing the public.
    In fact, it is precisely in the United States that forced labor has reached an alarming scale. In the United States, millions of workers and employees are forced to lose their jobs, and monopoly capitalists use this situation to force the vast majority of other workers to engage in cheap, slave-like labor in order to extract maximum profits. Not only that, but the U.S. government has also enacted many laws that persecute workers' freedom and violate trade union rights. U.S. monopoly capitalists practice medieval-style slave labor on black and foreign immigrant workers in the United States, as well as on workers in South America and elsewhere. If the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions truly wanted to serve the rights and welfare of workers, it would have no reason not to expose this forced labor behavior in the United States, but instead would be an accomplice to it. It is very clear that the United States is instructing the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to do this, not based on any facts, but with ulterior motives. The United States is attempting to use this slander to damage the prestige of the People's Republic of China and incite hatred against the People's Republic of China. However, this attempt by the United States is futile. This kind of rumor and slander by the United States cannot damage the prestige of the People's Republic of China in the slightest; it can only once again expose the dead end of the rumor-mongers and slanderers.

### 驳斥美国诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”

    驳斥美国诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”
    最近国际自由工会联合会在美国指使之下向出席联合国大会第九届会议的各国代表团提出了一个文件，妄图以我国政府颁布的“中华人民共和国劳动改造条例”为依据，诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”。美国使用这种伎俩，不是从今日开始的。自一九四七年以来，美国就不断利用联合国的各种会议诬蔑苏联和各人民民主国家实行“强迫劳动”，妄图借此削弱这些国家在世界人民中日益增长的威信。中华人民共和国成立后，美国即曾指使蒋介石卖国集团代表和国际自由工会联合会对我国进行过这种卑劣的诬蔑。现在，美国居然把我国对罪犯实行的劳动改造条例说成是所谓在中国有了“强迫劳动”的“证据”，要联合国大会来加以讨论。这真是荒谬已极。
    中华人民共和国成立后，劳动人民成了国家的主人。劳动的成果属于劳动者自己所有。我国宪法上规定了公民有劳动的权利，劳动者有休息权，在年老、疾病或丧失劳动能力时有获得物质帮助的权利。我国宪法并且规定国家采取各项措施来保证公民和劳动者享受这些权利。广大劳动人民在劳动中发挥了高度的热情和创造性；无论在劳动就业、劳动保险、工资、福利、卫生、疗养和文化教育等各方面都得到国家的极大帮助。在我国，劳动已成为一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情。至于说对那些危害国家和人民利益的罪犯，我们国家则是采取劳动改造的政策，使罪犯在监管期间养成劳动习惯，学会生产技能，提高文化。这样，罪犯在刑满释放后就可以成为对社会能有所贡献的新人。这些劳动改造的措施，和所谓强迫劳动毫无共同之点。美国以我国对罪犯实行劳动改造的事实作为我国实行“强迫劳动”的证据，完全是混淆视听的恶意歪曲。
    事实上，正是在美国，强迫劳动达到了惊人的规模。在美国，几百万的工人和雇员被迫失去劳动的机会，垄断资本家们就利用这种情况来迫使另外的广大工人群众从事着廉价的奴隶似的劳动，以榨取最大限度的利润。不仅如此，美国政府还制订许多迫害工人自由，侵犯工会权利的法案。美国垄断资本家对于在美国的黑人和外国移民劳动者以及在南美洲和其他各地的劳动者则实行着中世纪式的奴隶劳动。国际自由工会联合会假如真正要为工人权利和福利来服务，就没有理由不去揭发美国这种强迫劳动行为，反而为虎作伥。很显然。美国指使国际自由工会联合会这样做，不是根据什么事实，而是别有用心的。美国企图利用这种诬蔑来损害中华人民共和国的威望，煽动对中华人民共和国的仇视。但是，美国这个企图是徒然的。美国这种造谣诬蔑丝毫也损害不了中华人民共和国的威望，它只能又一次暴露了造谣诬蔑者的穷途末路。
