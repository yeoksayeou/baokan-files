    China Successfully Manufactures Argon Gas
    China can now manufacture pure argon gas, which is used in fluorescent lamps, neon lights, and several radio vacuum tubes. Guo Xingsun, a doctor at the Shanghai Film Studio, successfully researched the method for manufacturing argon gas.
    Guo Xingsun originally wanted to research the self-manufacture of nitrous oxide for medical use (anesthetic for surgery), but he inadvertently discovered that separating argon gas from industrial oxygen was relatively simple. In the autumn of 1951, he began experimenting in his own home during his spare time. After nearly a year of exploration, he solved the key problem of removing nitrogen from argon gas. He tested the produced argon gas in fluorescent lamps and neon lights, proving that the domestically produced argon gas was the same as the imported product. Subsequently, he continued to study the extraction of argon gas using domestic materials, greatly reducing costs. Now, Guo Xingsun has contributed the argon gas manufacturing technology to the country. His complete set of equipment has also been transported to the Nanjing Bulb Factory and put into production in August. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国自制氩气成功
    一种应用在日光灯、霓虹灯和几种无线电真空管中的纯氩气，我国现在已能制造。研究成功制造氩气方法的是上海电影制片厂医师郭星孙。
    郭星孙原想研究自制医药上用的笑气（开刀时麻醉用），无意中发现从工业用的氧气中分离氩气比较简便。一九五一年的秋天，他开始利用业余时间在自己家里进行试验，经过近一年的摸索，解决了把氩气中的氮气除去的关键问题。他把提出的氩气放在日光灯、霓虹灯中实验，证明自制的氩气同进口货一样。接着，他又继续研究利用国产材料提取氩气，使成本大大降低。现在，郭星孙已把氩气制造技术贡献给国家。他的全套设备也已运往南京灯泡厂，并在八月份开始投入生产。　（新华社）
