Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 9th:

U.S. military aircraft, in a total of six batches comprising fifty sorties, intruded into the airspace over the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province on the 7th and 8th for armed provocations, once again seriously violating our country's airspace.

On the 7th, from 08:42 to 08:46, a batch of twelve U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Toumenshan Island, Nantian Island, and an area 20 kilometers east of Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province for armed provocations.

From 11:09 to 11:16, a batch of four U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Sanmen Island, Nantian Island, an area 20 kilometers southeast of Ningbo City, an area 20 kilometers south of Ningbo City, and the vicinity of Xiangshan County in Zhejiang Province for armed provocations.

At 13:39, a batch of twelve U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Nantian Island in Zhejiang Province for armed provocations.

These three batches of U.S. military aircraft that violated our country's airspace all fled in a southeasterly direction over the ocean under interception by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force.

On the 8th, from 10:10 to 10:16, a batch of four U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Tian'ao Island in Zhejiang Province for armed provocations. Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding Tian'ao Island personally witnessed that these four aircraft were propeller-driven and had U.S. Air Force insignias painted on their fuselages.

From 12:36 to 12:50, a batch of twelve U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Yuhuan, Dongtoushan Island, and the vicinity of Songmen in Zhejiang Province for armed provocations.

From 13:00 to 13:04, a batch of six U.S. F-2H type aircraft intruded into the airspace over Dongjishan Island in Zhejiang Province, circled twice, and then intruded into the airspace over Toumenshan Island and Tian'ao Island for armed provocations. Three of them conducted reconnaissance at low altitude. At that time, Liu Youcai, Feng Haihua, Duan Xinglong, and other observers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Tian'ao Island all saw that these six aircraft had U.S. Air Force insignias painted on their fuselages.

These three batches of U.S. military aircraft that violated our country's airspace all fled in a southeasterly direction over the ocean after Chinese People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units opened fire.

The commanders and fighters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force units of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front expressed great indignation at the serious incident of U.S. military aircraft violating our country's airspace. They are now closely monitoring the development of the situation and are highly vigilant, preparing to fiercely strike any U.S. military aircraft that dare to violate our country's airspace at any time.
