    The "Taiwan—Our Motherland's Treasure Island, We Must Liberate It" lecture series, jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Association for Science and Technology Popularization and the Nanjing Branch of the Geographical Society of China, has been well received by the masses. So far, the lecture series has given twenty-seven lectures, with nearly 20,000 listeners. The lecture series explains that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China from the aspects of Taiwan's development history, the composition of its residents, geographical location, and international agreements. It also introduces Taiwan's natural conditions, abundant products and resources, and the suffering of the Taiwanese people under the rule of the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
