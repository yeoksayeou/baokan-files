    Shandong Province Trains Large Numbers of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Cadres
    Henan Province Prepares to Train Agricultural Production Cooperative Technicians
    To meet the needs of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement this winter and next spring, Shandong has trained a large number of mutual aid and cooperation cadres. The Dezhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has trained more than 13,500 people. These cadres include members of the county party committee, secretaries of district committees, township cadres, and presidents of agricultural production cooperatives. The Dezhou Prefectural Committee also plans to conduct a training session in November and December for untrained district-level cadres, key township cadres, and backbone members of newly established cooperatives. The aim is to improve their socialist consciousness, implement the guidelines, class line, and basic policies of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and teach them the methods of leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Changwei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also trained more than 4,700 mutual aid and cooperation cadres. The Propaganda Department of the Changwei Prefectural Committee recently inspected the work of training mutual aid and cooperation cadres and found that some places were not strict in selecting trainees and that the training content was generalized. The Tai'an and Heze Prefectural Committees have also trained a large number of mutual aid and cooperation cadres. (Our Shandong Reporter Station)
    In order to meet the needs of the great development of mutual aid and cooperation in the province, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Henan Provincial People's Government has decided to train 150,000 agricultural production cooperative technicians this winter. This winter and next spring, Henan Province will develop to 50,000 agricultural production cooperatives, so the training of agricultural production cooperative technicians is very important. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Henan Province requires each agricultural production cooperative to train one agricultural technician, one double-铧犁 operator, and one animal husbandry technician, and stipulates the training content. Agricultural technicians mainly study how to increase the yield of local major crops and some technical measures, double-铧犁 operators mainly study the use and repair techniques of double-铧犁, and animal husbandry technicians mainly study the feeding and management of livestock and simple disease prevention methods. Recently, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Henan Province held a meeting of the heads of agricultural technology guidance stations in various special zones, cities, and key counties to study this work in detail.

    山东省各地训练了大批互助合作干部
    河南省准备训练农业生产合作社技术员
    为适应今冬明春互助合作运动发展的需要，山东各地已训练了大批的互助合作干部，中共德州地委就训练了一万三千五百多名。这些干部包括县委委员、区委书记、乡干部和农业生产合作社的社长等。德州地委会还拟在十一、十二两月中，把未经训练的区级干部、乡的主要干部和新办社的骨干分子进行一次训练。要求通过训练来提高他们的社会主义觉悟，贯彻互助合作运动的方针、阶级路线和基本政策；使他们学会领导互助合作运动的方法。中共昌潍地委也训练了互助合作干部四千七百多名。昌潍地委宣传部最近对训练互助合作干部的工作进行了检查，发现有些地方对学员的选择不严，训练内容一般化等问题。泰安、菏泽等地委也训练了大批的互助合作干部。　（本报山东记者站）
    河南省人民政府农林厅为适应全省互助合作大发展的需要，决定在今年冬天训练十五万名农业生产合作社技术员。今冬明春河南省农业生产合作社将发展到五万个，因此训练农业生产合作社技术员的工作十分重要。河南省农林厅要求每个农业生产合作社训练农业技术员、双铧犁手和畜牧技术员各一人，并规定了训练内容。农业技术员主要是学习如何增加当地主要作物的产量和一些技术措施，双铧犁手主要是学习双铧犁的使用方法和修理技术，畜牧技术员主要学习牲畜的饲养管理和简单疫病的防治方法。最近河南省农林厅曾召开各专区、市和重点县农业技术指导站站长会议，详细地研究了这一工作。　（本报河南记者站）
