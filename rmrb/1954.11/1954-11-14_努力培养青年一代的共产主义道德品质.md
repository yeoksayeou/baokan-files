    Strive to Cultivate the Communist Moral Character of the Younger Generation
    With the development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and with the strengthening of the Party's socialist education for youth, the socialist consciousness of China's younger generation has greatly improved. In the struggle for the cause of socialism, they have displayed a high degree of collectivism and labor enthusiasm; on all fronts, new model figures and new activists are constantly emerging, and glorious examples of observing discipline and cherishing public property are appearing.
    In order to further give play to the role of youth in the cause of socialist construction, and in order to cultivate every youth into a useful talent for New China, our Party must continue to strengthen communist moral education for the younger generation.
    Cultivating the communist moral character of the younger generation is a regular educational task, and its central content is to constantly improve the communist consciousness of youth and eliminate the influence of bourgeois decadent ideology on youth. For this purpose, we must help young people to draw clear lines on several important principled issues, distinguish right from wrong, and make them understand what to learn and what to oppose.
    The younger generation should be educated to be good at embodying the spirit of collectivism in daily life and to overcome selfish psychology. China's youth should be collectivists, always concerned about major national affairs, national construction, and the suffering and happiness of the people, rather than egoists who only pay attention to personal life and personal interests. What young people should often consider is not what more to ask from the country, but what they have done for the country today, what they will do for the country tomorrow, how they can do more and better, and how to give play to the spirit of sacrificing oneself for the interests of the country in daily work.
    Love of labor is a characteristic of communist morality. The noble emotion of love and respect for labor should be cultivated in the younger generation, and they should be educated to actively labor, constantly learn and master scientific knowledge, constantly improve labor productivity, and constantly improve work efficiency, overcome the exploiting class's ideas of laziness and contempt for labor, especially contempt for physical labor, and oppose lazy behavior. In the past, our education in this area has mostly focused on workers and peasants, while neglecting young cadres and students in institutions, which is a shortcoming that needs to be corrected urgently.
    The spirit of independent creation should be promoted among young people, and the psychology of dependence and conservatism should be overcome. Lenin quoted Engels as saying: "Our party is a party of innovators, and it is always the youth who most enthusiastically follow the innovators. Our party is a party that fights selflessly against outdated and corrupt phenomena, and it is always the youth who will be the first to fight selflessly." Therefore, we must not only educate young people to humbly learn from their elders, learning the knowledge and experience accumulated by their elders over many years, but also encourage young people to think independently, work independently, act independently, and create boldly. For the activities of young people, what should be seen first is its positive factors, rather than using the attitude of a bourgeois aristocratic master, criticizing this and picking on that, so that they feel worthless and at a loss. We must of course educate young people to be humble and cautious and to try their best to avoid mistakes; but it must be noted that if young people are always afraid of making mistakes, and therefore are hesitant in everything, stick to the rules, only say what others have said, and only do what others have ordered, then it will be difficult to cultivate them into good workers. Unfortunately, judging from the current overall situation of youth, due to our improper education, they generally still appear too restrained, and have not fully expressed the kind of vigorous and lively spirit, which is precisely what our cause needs. Therefore, we should encourage young people's spirit of progress in various ways and methods, and let them independently engage in various creative activities.
    Frugality is the fine tradition and recognized virtue of our people, and the younger generation should be educated to inherit this tradition and oppose extravagance. We also advocate proper enjoyment, which is material and cultural, and its foundation is our own labor. This enjoyment can cultivate young people's noble emotions and fine character, and in turn promote the progress of production, work, and study. As for the bourgeoisie, hedonism is their outlook on life, and enjoyment is the whole of their life, and its foundation is the cruel exploitation of the working people. Because the bourgeoisie is a declining class, they are excessively extravagant, low-level, and vulgar. This enjoyment can only make a vigorous young person lose lofty aspirations, turn their eyes from the boiling struggle to a decadent life, and become a morally corrupt person. Therefore, every young person must be able to clearly distinguish between the way of life of our revolutionaries and the decadent way of life of the bourgeoisie, and not be tempted by the bourgeois way of life.
    The younger generation should be cultivated to have the noble quality of loyalty and honesty, and to oppose the style of deception. Chairman Mao taught us to resolutely guard against exaggeration and resolutely guard against "bragging," "pretending," and "stealing," which should become our motto. Honesty and integrity are qualities we must possess. Under no circumstances, and in front of no one, should we distort the truth or distort the facts for personal gain. That hypocritical philistine habit and the bad habit of reporting good news but not bad news must be rejected.
    These are some of the issues we should pay attention to when conducting communist moral education for the younger generation. It should be known that moral education for the younger generation cannot be carried out in isolation; it must be closely linked with various struggles in society. Because our country is still in a transitional period, the remnants of the old society, especially hooligans, have not been completely eliminated, and they are still harming the physical and mental development of some young people; and the decadent ideology of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois way of life still directly and indirectly affect young people in many aspects, poisoning young people. In this way, some young people have developed selfishness, laziness, and other psychological traits; a small number of young people with weak wills have even been tainted with theft, gambling, playing with and insulting women, and other hooligan bad habits under the inducement of hooligans, and some have even completely embarked on the road of corruption and degeneration. Therefore, in the process of conducting communist moral education for young people, we must also use the power of the government and the power of public opinion to wage a resolute struggle against the remnants of the old society that harm young people. Investigation materials from major cities have proven that the crimes of hooligans poisoning and ravaging young people are serious. The corruption and degeneration of some young people is the direct result of hooligans enticing them. Local governments must, in accordance with established policies, severely crack down on hooligan activities, and carry out publicity against hooligans and hooligan behavior, so that young people can recognize the ugly faces of hooligans and recognize the criminal consequences that hooligan behavior will inevitably cause. Expose the guise by which hooligans deceive and entice young people. This work occupies an important position in the current moral education of young people, and it should be done well in a practical way.
    Investigation materials from major cities have also proven that some capitalists who attempt to resist socialist transformation are using money and pornography to entice young workers in an attempt to corrupt and degenerate them in order to divert the workers' attention and relax supervision over them. At the same time, old book stalls that rent and sell pornographic books and vulgar entertainment venues, which are part of the decadent culture of the bourgeoisie, are still spreading toxins that corrupt the morals of young people. It is necessary to expose the harm these vulgar and vicious things cause to young people, and youth league organizations in various places should, based on the situation in their own regions and units, use typical cases revealed in newspapers to guide young people in necessary discussions (this does not mean that young people should conduct self-criticism), so that young people can recognize the vulgarity and ugliness of bourgeois ideology and raise their vigilance; at the same time, on this basis, conduct communist moral education for them, conduct communist outlook on life education, and inspire them to fight for the great cause of socialism and communism. Local governments should also, after investigation and research, determine plans, and resolutely transform old book stalls and vulgar entertainment venues that rent and sell pornographic books step by step, and block these nests that corrupt the morals of young people; and actively carry out mass cultural entertainment and sports activities, mobilize writers and artists to create lively, interesting, and encouraging works in large quantities, and constantly meet the cultural needs of young people.
    Education for the younger generation is a long-term task, and local party committees should list it as one of their regular tasks. In the process of carrying out this work, special attention should be paid to using the power of the youth league organization, and strengthening specific leadership over the work of the youth league in accordance with the characteristics of young people. In guiding the youth league organization in the process of serving the central work, we must pay attention to the ideological trends of young people at any time, pay attention to the moral behavior of young people, pay attention to the daily life of young people, pay attention to new people and new things among young people, and guide the youth league organization to adopt lively and diverse ways to educate and guide all young people to play a greater role in the cause of national construction.

    努力培养青年一代的共产主义道德品质
    随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展，随着党对青年的社会主义教育的加强，我国青年一代的社会主义觉悟有了很大的提高。在为社会主义事业而进行的斗争中，他们发挥了高度的集体主义精神和劳动热情；在各个战线上，都不断涌现着新的模范人物和新的积极分子，出现着遵守纪律、爱护公共财产的光荣事例。
    为了进一步发挥青年在社会主义建设事业中的作用，为了把每一个青年都培养成为新中国的有用人材，我们党对青年一代的共产主义道德教育必须继续加强。
    培养青年一代的共产主义道德品质，是一项经常性的教育工作，它的中心内容是不断地提高青年的共产主义觉悟，清除资产阶级腐朽思想对青年的影响。为了这一目的，我们必须在几个重要的原则问题上，帮助青年们划清界限，明辨是非，使他们懂得学习什么，反对什么。
    应当教育青年一代善于在日常生活中体现集体主义精神，克服自私心理。我国青年应当是集体主义者，时刻关心天下大事，关心国家建设，关心人民苦乐，而不是那种只注意个人生活，只关心个人利益的利己主义者。青年们应该经常考虑的不是从国家多要些什么，而是今天给国家作了些什么，明天又要给国家作些什么，怎样才能作得更多更好，怎样发挥在日常工作中为国家利益而舍身奋斗的精神。
    热爱劳动是共产主义道德的特征。应当培养青年一代热爱和尊敬劳动的高尚情感，教育他们积极劳动，不断学习和掌握科学知识，不断提高劳动生产率，不断提高工作效率，克服好逸恶劳、轻视劳动特别是轻视体力劳动的剥削阶级思想，反对懒惰行为。过去我们在这方面的教育，多半偏重于工农青年，而对机关青年干部和学生则有所忽视，这是亟应纠正的缺点。
    应当在青年当中提倡独立创造的精神，克服依赖保守的心理。列宁早就援引过恩格斯的话说：“我们党是革新者底党，而最热心地跟随着革新者走的总是青年。我们党是同陈旧腐败的现象舍身奋斗的党，而首先去舍身奋斗的始终会是青年。”因此我们不仅要教育青年虚心地向长辈学习，学习长辈多年积累的知识和经验，而且必须鼓励青年们独立思考，独立工作，独立活动，大胆创造。对于青年人的活动，首先应当看到的是它的积极因素，而不是用资产阶级贵族老爷的态度，这也指责，那也挑剔，以致使他们感到一无是处，左右为难。我们当然要教育青年们虚心谨慎，极力避免错误；但必须注意：如果弄得青年们老是怕犯错误，因而对任何事情都是缩手缩脚，墨守成规，只说别人说过的话，只作别人吩咐的事，那就很难把他们培养成为好的工作者。可惜就目前整个青年状况来看，由于我们教育不得法，他们一般还显得过分拘谨，没有充分表现出那种朝气蓬勃、生龙活虎般的精神，而这种精神却恰恰是我们的事业所需要的。因此，我们应当从各个方面用各种方法鼓励青年们的前进精神，放手让他们独立地从事各种创造性的活动。
    俭朴是我国人民的优良传统，公认的美德，应当教育青年一代继承这种传统，反对奢侈。我们也主张正当的享受，这种享受是物质的，也是文化的，它的基础是我们自己的劳动。这种享受可以培养青年人的高尚情感和优良品格，反过来又推动生产、工作和学习的前进。至于资产阶级，享乐至上是他们的人生观，享受就是他们生活的全部，它的基础是对劳动人民的残酷剥削。由于资产阶级是一个没落的阶级，他们是奢侈无度的，低级的，庸俗的。这种享受只能使一个朝气蓬勃的青年失去远大的志向，把目光从沸腾的斗争转向靡烂的生活，成为道德败坏的人。所以必须让每一个青年都能够清楚地区别我们革命者的生活方式和资产阶级腐朽的生活方式，不为资产阶级生活方式所引诱。
    应当培养青年一代具有忠诚老实的高尚品质，反对欺诈作风。毛主席教导我们力戒虚夸，力戒
  “吹”“装”“偷”，这应该成为我们的座右铭。诚实和正直是我们必须具有的品质。不论在什么情况下面，不论在什么人面前，都不应当为了个人利害歪曲真理，歪曲事实。那种虚伪的市侩习气，报喜不报忧的恶劣作风，都是必须排斥的。
    这就是我们在对青年一代进行共产主义道德教育时所应注意的几个问题。应当知道，对青年一代的道德教育，不能孤立地进行，它必须和社会上各方面的斗争紧密地联系起来。由于我们的国家还处在过渡时期，旧社会的遗毒，特别是流氓还没有清除净尽，还危害着一部分青年的身心发展；而资产阶级的腐朽思想，资产阶级的生活方式，在许多方面还直接间接地影响着青年，毒害着青年。这样，就使一部分青年滋长了自私、懒惰等等心理；少数意志不坚强的青年，更在流氓的引诱下，沾染了偷盗、赌博、玩弄和侮辱妇女以及其他的流氓恶习，有的甚至完全走上了腐化堕落的道路。所以在向青年进行共产主义道德教育的过程中，还必须运用政府的力量，运用社会舆论的力量，同危害青年的旧社会遗毒作坚决斗争。各大城市的调查材料证明，流氓分子毒害和摧残青年的罪恶是严重的。有些青年的腐化堕落，是流氓分子直接勾引的结果。各地政府必须根据既定的政策，严厉打击流氓活动，并开展反对流氓和流氓行为的宣传，使青年们认识流氓的丑恶面目，认识流氓行为必然造成的罪恶结果。揭穿流氓借以欺骗和勾引青年的幌子。这项工作在目前的青年道德教育中占有重要位置，应当切实把它作好。
    各大城市的调查材料也证明，一部分企图抵抗社会主义改造的资本家，为了转移工人的视线，放松对他们的监督，正利用金钱、色情引诱青年工人力图使他们腐化堕落。同时，作为资产阶级颓废文化构成部分的租售黄色书刊的旧书摊和下流娱乐场所，还在散播着败坏青年人道德的毒素。必须揭发这些下流恶毒的东西对青年的毒害，并由各地青年团组织根据本地区、本单位的情况，运用报纸揭露的典型事例，引导青年们进行必要的讨论（这不是说要青年们进行检讨），让青年们认识资产阶级思想的庸俗和丑恶，提高警惕；同时在这样的基础上对他们进行共产主义的道德教育，进行共产主义人生观的教育，启发他们为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业而奋斗。各地政府还应该经过调查研究，确定方案，有步骤地坚决地改造租售黄色书刊的旧书摊和下流娱乐场所，堵塞这些败坏青年道德的巢穴；并且要积极开展群众性的文化娱乐和体育活动，动员作家、艺术家大量地创作生动有趣的、鼓舞青年前进的作品，不断地满足青年们的文化需要。
    对青年一代的教育，是长期的工作，各地党委应当把它列为经常工作之一。在进行这一工作的过程中，要特别注意运用青年团组织的力量，按照青年的特点，加强对青年团工作的具体领导。指导青年团组织在为中心工作服务的过程中，要随时注意青年的思想动态，注意青年的道德行为，注意青年的日常生活，注意青年中的新人新事，并指导青年团组织采取生动活泼、多种多样的方式，教育和引导全体青年在祖国建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
