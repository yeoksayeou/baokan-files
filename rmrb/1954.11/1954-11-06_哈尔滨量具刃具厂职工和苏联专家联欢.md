Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 5th: Workers at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, built with Soviet assistance, held a joint celebration with Soviet experts on the evening of the 4th to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Just over a year ago, this place was still a wilderness. Now, a precision tool manufacturing factory built with the latest Soviet technology has been born.

    Bricklayer Dong Guoliang recalled the moving scene during winter construction when Soviet expert Ivakin braved the severe cold of over minus twenty degrees Celsius to teach workers how to lay bricks in winter on the icy ground. At the meeting, he expressed the workers' heartfelt gratitude for the sincere and selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to China. Hao Letian, a young worker from the milling cutter and reamer workshop, sat closely with the veteran expert Kapekin. It was with the enthusiastic help of this veteran expert that he has now successfully mastered a universal milling machine that can process three pieces at once.

    Expert Kapekin, with his graying hair, excitedly stood up and said that this was the first time he had spent the October Revolution Day in such a friendly country. He said that he must make better use of every minute to teach his skills to Chinese workers.

    The workers also performed a number of wonderful artistic programs at the meeting.

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工和苏联专家联欢
    【新华社哈尔滨五日电】在苏联帮助下建成的哈尔滨量具刃具厂的职工在四日晚上和苏联专家一起联欢，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年。一年多以前，这里还是一片旷野。现今，一座以苏联最新技术建设的精密工具制造厂已经诞生了。
    瓦工董国良回忆起在冬季施工中，苏联专家伊瓦基冒着零下二十多度的严寒在冰天雪地中教导工人学习冬季砌砖法的感人情景。他在会上表达了工人们对苏联给予中国真诚无私的帮助的由衷感谢。铣刀铰刀车间青年工人郝乐天亲密地和老专家卡培金坐在一起。正是在这位老专家的热忱帮助下，他现在已成功地掌握了一次能加工三个活的万能铣床。
    头发斑白的卡培金专家激动地起来说，他是第一次在这样友好的国家中渡过十月革命节。他说他一定要更好地利用每一分钟将他的技术教给中国工人。
    工人们在会上并演出了多项精采的文艺节目。
