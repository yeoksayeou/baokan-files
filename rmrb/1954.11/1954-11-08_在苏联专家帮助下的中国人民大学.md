    Chinese People's University Under the Assistance of Soviet Experts
    Yu Shengqi, Head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Committee of Chinese People's University
    Chinese People's University was born one year after the founding of the People's Republic of China. It inherited the fine traditions of revolutionary education in the old liberated areas, systematically and comprehensively studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and was founded under the direct guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. The purpose of the State Council of the Central People's Government in deciding to establish the Chinese People's University was "to create a socialist university modeled after Soviet universities that meets China's construction needs, in order to correctly and effectively learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology and the theory and practice of socialist construction, and to train specialized personnel in finance, economics, politics, law, and Russian, armed with scientific socialist knowledge and loyal to the cause of the Party and the state, as well as teachers of Marxism-Leninism for universities." Four years of practice have proven that the policy set by the Central Government is entirely correct. We have basically completed the tasks assigned by the Central Government and have achieved certain successes and experiences. Now the undergraduate program of Chinese People's University is divided into nine departments, in addition to ten specialized courses, as well as Marxism-Leninism research classes, preparatory courses, and an affiliated workers' and peasants' accelerated middle school, with a total of over 10,000 teachers, students, and staff. Currently, it has entered a new stage of gradual consolidation and improvement from massive development. We must remember where our blessings come from, and this is inseparable from the sincere and fraternal guidance and assistance of the Soviet experts who came to our school from afar.
    The Soviet experts' assistance to Chinese People's University is multifaceted, and based on the school's continuous development and the gradual improvement of teachers' levels, they have given us many practical and specific scientific guidance.
    In the autumn of 1950, at the beginning of the school's establishment, there was a lack of a large number of teachers and translators. The school leadership, based on the Soviet experience and combined with our actual needs, drew some veteran cadres with considerable qualifications and a large number of revolutionary young intellectuals from all aspects of the school to the teaching and research sections. Under the personal cultivation of Soviet experts, they adopted the two methods of "learning while teaching" and organizing graduate studies, which initially solved the serious difficulty of a lack of teachers; at the same time, in order to enable translators to quickly master their profession, the method of "learning while translating, and asking while translating" was adopted, which solved the problem of a lack of translators. At that time, the main energy of Soviet experts was focused on lecturing to teachers and graduate students, tutoring, and compiling teaching outlines and lecture notes. Later, most of the teachers, with the help and guidance of Soviet experts, after a short period of practical teaching training, initially mastered the basic content of Soviet textbooks and Soviet teaching methods. The main strength of Soviet experts, in addition to continuing to help train graduate students, help and guide teachers and leading cadres to improve their scientific level, also gave specific guidance to teaching methods, compiling teaching materials, and scientific research. From September 1950 to August 1954, a total of 1,158 one-, two-, and three-year political theory and various professional graduate students (including Marxism-Leninism research classes) graduated from our school. Among them, in addition to some who stayed at the school, a total of 767 have successively served as lecturers of Marxism-Leninism theory and various majors, as well as deputy directors of teaching and research sections in 110 universities across the country. This is one of the remarkable achievements of the Soviet experts' earnest teachings and enthusiastic assistance.
    At the beginning of the school's establishment, according to the needs of national construction, the professional settings and training goals of each department and subject were determined, and then teaching plans for each major were formulated on this basis. At that time, Soviet experts helped us formulate teaching plans for each major in the nine departments. These teaching plans were basically based on Soviet professional teaching plans, and considering China's specific circumstances, mainly considering the needs of national construction, the level of teachers and students, and made appropriate changes. The practice of more than 7,000 graduates from undergraduate and specialized courses in various construction posts in the motherland has proven that the teaching plans of our school's various majors are basically correct and meet the requirements of national construction. According to the teaching plans, Soviet experts also helped our school compile teaching outlines and teaching materials for various majors. These teaching outlines and teaching materials are based on Marxist-Leninist theory and contain the valuable experience and latest scientific achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction over the past 30 years. Our teachers have systematically and deeply studied and researched them, and in accordance with the nature and characteristics of various professional sciences, have made them correctly and organically linked with China's reality for teaching, in order to play a greater role in China's socialist construction. According to statistics, from September 1950 to June 1953, Soviet experts personally compiled a total of more than 11.32 million words of teaching plans, teaching outlines, and teaching materials in our school, most of which have been referenced or adopted by universities across the country.
    From the day of its birth, under the suggestion and assistance of Soviet experts, the school leadership established a system of scientific research work and adhered to it. In all teaching and research sections that have Soviet experts, the school designates Soviet experts as scientific instructors to guide scientific research and other teaching work. Over the past four years, the encouragement, guidance, and assistance of Soviet experts to the scientific research work undertaken by our school's teachers have played a tremendous role. At the beginning of the school year in 1950, except for a few people who had the ability to conduct scientific research, the majority of teachers were young and had little scientific research ability and experience. Soviet experts enthusiastically gave our young teachers reports on how to conduct scientific research, and Soviet experts in each teaching and research section often guided our teachers on the specific research methods of each science, so that our teachers initially understood how to start research work. The guidance of Soviet experts did not stop at general theoretical reports, but often encouraged and guided young teachers to train themselves in a down-to-earth manner. In the process of research, from determining the topic, collecting data, drafting outlines, determining basic arguments, and even on how to analyze materials, how to go deep into factories and mines to study practical problems, they gave specific guidance. Soviet experts gave us great help in the direction, theory, and methods of research, so the development of scientific research work in our school was relatively rapid. In the first semester, the number of people participating in scientific research work in our school was 60, and 58 scientific papers were completed; by the fifth academic year, according to the statistics of teachers' scientific research plans, the number of participants was 468, with 411 special topic papers, and the quality of papers also improved significantly every year. Some special topic research can provide certain practical assistance to production departments. All of these are inseparable from the patient and enthusiastic cultivation and guidance of Soviet experts.
      "Teaching should be linked to practice, and Soviet experience should be combined with China's situation" is our school's educational policy. Soviet experts attach great importance to this policy and often suggest that we establish contact with relevant business departments. The school leadership has always attached importance to this point. Initially, the various departments of our school generally only required business departments to provide materials, or invited them to give special reports and solicit their opinions on courses. Later, we gradually transitioned from simply asking business departments for help to actively striving for mutual cooperation, that is, we sent teachers to factories, mines, and enterprise departments according to plan for further study and practice, to study the production situation and existing problems in enterprises, to participate in professional meetings of enterprise departments, and even to establish research groups with enterprise departments, so as to improve the professional level of teachers, and at the same time, we can also put forward some suggestions for improving work to enterprise departments. After two large-scale production practices in our school, our contact with business departments has now moved to a higher stage. Our teachers can find new scientific research topics in the production process of factories, mines, and enterprises, and at the same time, they can combine the needs of production departments to make special reports on certain professional theories, giving certain assistance to business departments, so that the combination of science and production has gradually become closer.
    In order to implement the educational policy, Soviet experts also introduced the experience of Soviet universities in running schools, and helped Chinese People's University establish a teaching organization, clearly stipulating that the teaching and research section is the basic teaching organization of universities. Up to now, 48 teaching and research sections have been established in the school, and the tasks and plans of the teaching and research section work have been stipulated. At the same time, a leadership method that combines the single responsibility system of leadership at all levels with the full promotion of democracy was established. It is clearly stipulated that the president directly leads the department, the department director directly leads the teaching and research section and student study under the department, and the school is divided into the Academic Affairs Department, Research Department, etc., which are responsible for teaching and scientific research, etc. Both the school and department levels have scientific workers' representative meetings, which are democratic consultation institutions under the leadership of the president and department director. All major issues in teaching and scientific research are discussed collectively, extensively listen to the opinions of the masses, and then make resolutions, which are implemented after being approved by the president or department director. In addition, our school also implements the planning and strict inspection system of teaching work. From the new school year last year, the school first issued a plan outline, and each teaching and research section and teacher formulated specific work plans for the semester or academic year based on this, as well as teachers' daily execution plans for teaching. In order to ensure the effective implementation of various plans, our school has established a strict inspection system. In recent years, with the help and guidance of Soviet experts, our school has established systems such as listening to lectures, reporting forms, and strict examinations, which have effectively promoted the implementation of various plans. Finally, our school also established strict teaching discipline. From the beginning, Chinese People's University learned from Soviet experience, emphasizing the organization and discipline of teaching work. Both the Party committee and the administration attached importance to the education of conscious discipline, and opposed the bourgeois free and undisciplined teaching style. Especially after the Soviet experts came to the school, their noble socialist qualities and work attitude educated our school's teachers and students with practical examples, thus further consolidating the conscious labor attitude and learning attitude of our school's teachers and students. In recent years, the teaching discipline of our school has been good. Each semester stipulates that the school starts on September 1st and February 8th, and all teachers and students can arrive at school on time for formal classes. It is truly extremely rare for people to be absent from classes without reason. According to the statistics of the second semester of the 1951 to 1952 academic year, among 262 teachers, only 1.15% were late or missed classes (including one person who missed two hours due to illness, but did not ask for leave before class, and was also considered a violation of labor discipline). The attendance rate of students in the entire school averaged 99.72% over three years (including sick leave), and the average absenteeism rate was 0.02%.
    Soviet experts not only helped Chinese People's University train teachers and graduate students, formulate teaching plans, compile teaching outlines and teaching materials, guide scientific research work, and establish scientific teaching organizations, but also greatly helped the work of the school's Party organization. We have invited Soviet experts several times to introduce the advanced work experience of Party organizations in Soviet universities, and clearly recognized the tasks, working methods, and Party-government relations of Party organizations in Soviet universities. In recent years, the Party organization of Chinese People's University has absorbed the work experience of Party organizations in Soviet universities and followed the provisions of our Party Constitution to establish general branches and branches according to production units. We clearly recognized the important task of the Party organization in universities, which is to closely combine teaching and scientific research work, conduct specific political and ideological education work, and ensure the completion of teaching and scientific research tasks; at the same time, we attached importance to the education of teachers and students in political theory and policies from the beginning, and accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts to conduct formal and systematic political theory education for teachers and cadres in the form of Marxism-Leninism night university. Four years of practice have proven that this method is effective.
    The enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts to Chinese People's University is a concrete manifestation of the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, and the Soviet Union's scientific achievements and the outstanding achievements of the education cause are our brilliant examples. We will definitely learn from the Soviet Union honestly and diligently.

    在苏联专家帮助下的中国人民大学
    中共中国人民大学委员会宣传部长  俞圣祺
    中国人民大学是在中华人民共和国成立后一年诞生的。它是继承了老解放区革命教育的优良传统，系统、全面地学习苏联的先进经验，在苏联专家的直接指导和帮助下创办起来的。中央人民政府政务院决定创办中国人民大学的目的是“为了创办一个以苏联高等学校为榜样的适合于中国建设需要的社会主义性质的大学，以便正确而有效地学习苏联先进科学技术与社会主义建设的理论与实际，培养出以科学的社会主义知识武装起来的忠实于党和国家事业的财经、政法及俄文等方面的专门人材与高等学校的马克思列宁主义的师资”。四年来的实践证明，中央所规定的方针是完全正确的。我们基本完成了中央所交付的任务，获得了一定的成绩和经验。现在中国人民大学本科分为九个系，此外有十个专修科，还有马克思列宁主义研究班、预科以及附设工农速成中学等，共计师生员工达一万余人。目前从大量发展进入了逐步巩固提高的新阶段。饮水思源，这和远离家乡来到我校的苏联专家们的真诚的、兄弟般的指导和帮助是分不开的。
    苏联专家对中国人民大学的帮助是多方面的，而且根据学校的不断发展和教师水平的逐步提高，给了我们许多切实、具体的科学指导。
    一九五○年秋，学校初创，缺乏大批的教师和翻译人员，学校领导方面就以苏联的经验结合我们实际的需要，从学校的各方面抽调出一些条件相当的老干部和大批革命知识青年到教研室中去，在苏联专家的亲手培养下，采用“边学边教”和组织研究生学习的两种方法，初步解决了教师缺乏的严重困难；同时，为使翻译人员能够迅速掌握业务，采用“边学边译，边译边问”的方法，解决了翻译人员的缺乏问题。当时苏联专家的主要精力放在给教师和研究生讲课、辅导以及编写教学大纲和讲义方面。后来，大多数的教师在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，经过短期间的实际教学锻炼，初步掌握了苏联教材的基本内容和苏联教学的方法，苏联专家的主要力量除继续帮助培养研究生，帮助和指导教师及领导骨干提高科学水平外，并对教学方法、编写教材以及科学研究等工作加以具体指导。从一九五○年九月到一九五四年八月，我校的一、二、三年制的政治理论和各种专业研究生（包括马克思列宁主义研究班）共有一千一百五十八人毕业，其中除部分留校外，计有七百六十七人已先后在全国一百一十所高等学校担任马克思列宁主义理论和各种专业的主讲教师以及教研室的正副主任，这便是苏联专家的谆谆教导和热忱帮助的显著成果之一。
    学校创始，根据国家建设的需要，确定各系、科的专业设置和培养目标，然后以此为基础来制订各专业的教学计划。当时苏联专家曾帮助我们制订出九个系的各个专业的教学计划。这些教学计划，基本上是以苏联的专业教学计划为蓝本，并考虑到中国的具体情况，主要是考虑到国家建设的需要、教师和学生的水平，作了适当的变动而订成的。本科、专修科的七千多个毕业生在祖国各个建设岗位上的实践证明，我校的各科专业的教学计划基本上是正确的，是符合国家建设要求的。根据教学计划，苏联专家们还帮助我校编写出各门专业的教学大纲和教材，这些教学大纲和教材都是以马克思列宁主义理论为基础，并包含苏联三十多年来社会主义建设宝贵经验和科学的最新成就。我们的教师都对它进行了系统地、深入地学习和研究，并按照各门专业科学的性质和特点，使其正确地有机地和中国的实际联系起来进行教学，以便对我国社会主义各项建设发挥更大的作用。据统计，一九五○年九月到一九五三年六月，苏联专家在我校亲手编写的教学计划、教学大纲、教材等共计一千一百三十二万余字，其中大部分已为全国各高等学校所参考或采用。
    中国人民大学从诞生之日起，学校领导方面就在苏联专家建议和帮助下，建立了科学研究工作的制度，并坚持下来。凡聘有苏联专家的教研室，都由学校指定苏联专家任科学指导员，指导科学研究及其他教学方面的工作。四年来，苏联专家对我校教师所从事的科学研究工作的鼓励、指导和帮助，起了极大的作用。一九五○年开学时，我校的教师除少数人有科学研究的能力外，绝大部分的教师都是年轻的，谈不到什么科学研究的能力和经验。苏联专家就热忱地给我们年轻的教师作关于如何进行科学研究的报告，各教研室的苏联专家并经常指导我们教师关于各门科学的具体研究方法，使我们的教师初步懂得了怎样着手进行研究工作。苏联专家的指导，不光停留在一般的理论报告上，而且常常鼓励、引导年轻教师脚踏实地去锻炼自己。在研究的过程中，从确定题目、收集资料、拟订提纲、确定基本论点，甚至对如何分析材料，如何深入厂、矿研究实际问题等，都给以具体的指导。苏联专家对研究的方向、理论、方法都给了我们以极大的帮助，因此我校的科学研究工作的开展是比较迅速的。我校第一学期参加科学研究工作的人数是六十人，完成科学论文五十八篇；到第五学年，按教师们的科学研究计划统计，参加的人数是四百六十八人，专题论文四百十一篇，而且每年论文的质量也有显著的提高，有某些专题研究，能够对生产部门有一定的实际帮助。所有这些，都是和苏联专家们耐心、热忱的培养和指导分不开的。
      “教学同实际联系，苏联经验同中国情况相结合”是我校的教育方针。苏联专家很重视这一方针，经常建议我们要和有关业务部门建立联系。这一点，学校的领导方面是一贯重视的。最初，我校各系一般只是要求业务部门供给资料，或请他们作专题报告以及在课程方面征求他们的意见等。后来，就从单纯要求业务部门帮助逐步过渡到积极争取双方面相互合作，即我们按计划派教师到厂矿、企业部门中去进修实习，研究企业中的生产情况和存在的问题，参加企业部门的专业会议，甚至也和企业部门建立研究小组，借此提高教师的业务水平，同时也可给企业部门提出某些改进工作的建议。经过我校两次较大规模的生产实习，目前我们和业务部门的联系，已走向更高的阶段。我们的教师可在厂矿、企业的生产过程中找到新的科学研究的题目，同时，可结合生产部门的需要，作某些专业理论的专题报告，给业务部门一定的帮助，从而使科学和生产的结合逐步密切起来了。
    为了贯彻教育方针，苏联专家还介绍了苏联高等学校办学的经验，帮助中国人民大学建立起教学组织，明确规定了教研室是高等学校的教学基本组织。到目前为止，全校已建立起四十八个教研室，并规定了教研室工作的任务和计划。同时，建立了各级领导机构的单一负责制和充分发扬民主相结合的领导方法。明确规定校长直接领导系，系主任直接领导系属的教研室和学生的学习，校部分设教务部、研究部等，专管教学和科学研究等工作，校和系两级都设有科学工作者代表会议，这是在校长和系主任领导下的民主协议机构。一切教学和科学研究工作上的重大问题，都经过集体的讨论，广泛听取群众的意见，然后作出决议，经校长或系主任批准后，贯彻执行。此外，我校还贯彻了教学工作的计划性和严格的检查制度。我校从去年新学年开始，校部首先发出计划纲要，各教研室和教师就据此制订学期或学年的具体工作计划，以及教师的教学逐日执行计划。为使各种计划切实地实现，我校建立了严密的检查制度。几年来，我校在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，建立了听课、表报以及严格的考试等制度，对各种计划的贯彻起了有效的推动作用。最后，我校还建立了严格的教学纪律。中国人民大学一开始就学习苏联经验，强调教学工作的组织性和纪律性，党委和行政方面都重视自觉纪律的教育，反对资产阶级的自由散漫的教学作风。特别是苏联专家到校后，他们的社会主义高贵品质和劳动态度，以实际的范例来教育着我校的教师和学生，因而更加巩固了我校师生的自觉的劳动态度和学习态度。几年来，我校的教学纪律是良好的。每学期规定九月一日和二月八日开学，全校师生都能准时到校，正式上课，无故缺课的真是极为个别的现象。根据
  一九五一到一九五二学年第二学期的统计，任课教师二百六十二人，迟到、误课的仅占百分之一点一五（内有一人因病误课二小时，但课前未请假，亦作违反劳动纪律）。学生的到课率全校三年总平均为百分之九十九点七二（包括病假在内），每年平均旷课率为万分之二。
    苏联专家们不仅帮助中国人民大学培养教师和研究生，制定教学计划，编写教学大纲和教材，指导科学研究工作以及建立科学的教学组织等，并且对学校党组织的工作也有很大的帮助。我们曾经几次邀请苏联专家介绍过苏联高等学校中党组织的先进工作经验，明确认识了苏联高等学校中党组织的任务、工作方式、党政关系等问题。几年来，中国人民大学党组织是吸取了苏联高等学校党组织的工作经验并遵照我们党章的规定，按生产单位建立总支和支部的。我们明确认识了高等学校中的党组织的重要任务，是要密切结合教学和科学研究工作，进行具体的政治思想教育工作，保证教学和科学研究任务的完成；同时，我们一开始就重视对教师和学生进行政治理论和政策的教育，并接受苏联专家的建议，以马克思列宁主义夜大学的方式，对教师和干部进行正规的、系统的政治理论教育。四年来的实践证明，这种方式是有效的。
    苏联专家们对中国人民大学的热忱的帮助，是苏联人民的国际主义精神的具体表现。苏联的今天就是我们的明天，苏联科学的成就和教育事业的卓绝成绩，就是我们光辉的榜样。我们一定老老实实、勤勤恳恳地向苏联学习。
