Xinhua News Agency, 8th.

    The British delegation from all walks of life, invited by the Chinese People’s Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit China, held a press conference on the afternoon of November 8th. More than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists from the capital attended. The delegation issued the following statement at the meeting:

    The British delegation, representing various sectors of society, accepted the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit China. The purpose was to examine the activities of the Chinese People's Government in various fields and to meet people from all walks of life in China.

    The delegation includes: Members of Parliament, trade union workers, cooperative movement workers, and individuals from the arts, sciences, and education.

    The delegation departed from Britain on October 5th, made a short stay in the Soviet Union, and arrived in Beijing on October 12th, departing China on November 9th.

    During their stay in China, the delegation, as a whole or in groups, met with distinguished representatives from various sectors, including Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as from political, trade union, industrial, agricultural, cultural, educational, medical, municipal, cooperative, scientific, and artistic circles, as well as Christian and Buddhist circles.

    The delegation also visited various factories, universities, research institutions, schools, ethnic minority institutes, trade organizations, public works projects, coal mines, various cultural activity centers, temples, and other religious centers.

    The delegation was deeply impressed by the following facts: the large-scale construction projects visible everywhere; the pride of the Chinese people in everything that has been completed and is underway; the feeling that China now has a strong and efficient central government; the care for children; the new status acquired by women; and the activities of the literary, artistic, scientific, and academic circles with which the delegation came into contact.

    Workers' housing, schools, hospitals, factories, roads, various large-scale civil engineering projects, and flood control projects are being carried out or have been completed on a grand scale. The recovery of factories and mines that were previously out of repair or partially damaged is as astonishing as the new industrial construction and equipment. There is much evidence of the restoration of cultural and historical relics.

    The delegation saw no evidence that China is building or intends to build a war economy. On the contrary, the delegation has a clear impression that China urgently wants to feel secure so that it can continue to develop heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, and resource materials at a faster rate.

    However, like Mr. Attlee, we are convinced that the Chinese government and people have very strong feelings about Taiwan and are determined to recover it sooner or later.

    Considering that individual doubts and misgivings about the various aspects we have seen are bound to exist in a group as diverse as this delegation, nevertheless, we leave China with the knowledge that a strong, dynamic, enthusiastic, and organized people are determined to build a new China, a country that will be able to provide its people with a standard of living that has never been seen in the East.

    This delegation wishes to express its gratitude to the many officials of the Chinese People's Government and other Chinese people, whose assistance and willing cooperation ensured that every reasonable request for investigation made by this delegation was properly met. Special thanks are due to the staff of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, who made excellent arrangements for the delegation's travel of thousands of miles within China, and also to the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing and the British representative in Shanghai responsible for managing British nationals for arranging social gatherings for the delegation.

    This delegation believes that, through the various reports to be made by the members, the British people will be able to better understand the various issues, plans, and achievements of the Chinese people during these times, and the delegation confidently anticipates a friendly and beneficial response.

    This delegation firmly believes that trade between the two countries should be rapidly expanded and should not be restricted by unreasonable embargoes, and that there should be freer movement of people and exchange of information between the two countries, and that coexistence between our different political systems is possible.

    Finally, we believe that, as a result of our visit to China, we have helped many Chinese people to have a clearer understanding and a more friendly understanding of the general views of the British people on current international affairs.

    英国各界访华代表团在京向记者发表声明
    【新华社八日讯】应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请来我国访问的英国各界访华代表团在十一月八日下午举行了记者招待会，出席的有首都的中外记者三十多人。代表团在会上发表声明如下：
    英国各界代表团接受了中国人民对外文化协会的邀请访问中国，其目的是为了考察中国人民政府的各方面的活动，并会见中国各界人士。
    代表团包括：议会议员，工会工作者，合作社运动工作者和艺术、科学、教育界人士。
    代表团在十月五日从英国动身，在苏联作短期停留之后，于十月十二日到达北京，十一月九日离开中国。
    在中国期间，代表团全团或分组会见了包括总理周恩来先生在内的中国政界、工会、工业、农业、文教、医学、市政、合作社、科学和艺术界，基督教和佛教界等各方面的卓著的代表人物。
    代表团并参观了各种工厂、大学、研究机构、学校、民族学院、贸易机关、公用建筑工程、煤矿、各种文化活动中心、寺庙及其他宗教中心。
    代表团对于以下事实获有深刻印象：到处可以看见的大规模的建筑工程；中国人民对于已经完成的以及正在进行的一切引为自豪的心情；中国如今已有了一个强有力的、有效率的中央政府的感觉；对于儿童的关怀；妇女所获得的新地位，以及代表团与之接触的文学、艺术、科学、学术界的活动。
    工人住宅、学校、医院、工厂、道路、各种大规模的土木工程和防汛工程均以极其宏伟的规模进行着或已完成了。过去失修的以及部分遭到破坏的工厂矿山的恢复情况是与新的工业建设和装备同样惊人的。关于文化和历史古物的修葺有很多的证据。
    代表团没有看到中国正在建立或有意图要建立战争经济的证据。相反地，代表团获有清晰的印象认为中国十分迫切地希望感到安全，使它能够以更快的速度继续发展重工业、轻工业、农业以及原料的资源。
    然而，像艾德礼先生一样，我们深信中国政府和人民对于台湾有着非常强烈的情绪，并且决心要在迟早收复它。
    我们考虑到对于我们所看到的各个方面容有个别的怀疑和疑惑，这种情况在一个像本代表团一样的具有多种不同见解的团体中必然会存在的，虽然如此，我们离开中国之时是带着这种认识的：坚强的，有活力的，充满热情并且组织起来了的人民决心要建设一个新的中国，这个国家将能够使它的人民获得东方从来没有过的高度的生活水平。
    本代表团希望宣布其对中国人民政府的很多官员和其他中国人的感谢，由于他们的协助和乐意的合作，本代表团的每一个合理的考察要求都恰当地得到了满足。特别要感谢中国人民对外文化协会的工作人员，他们为代表团在中国境内旅行数千英里作了很好的安排，同时对在北京的英国代办和英国代办驻上海管理英侨的代表为本代表团安排的社交性的会晤表示感谢。
    本代表团相信，通过各团员将要作的各种报告，英国人民将能够更好地了解中国人民在这些时间内的各项问题、计划和成就，本代表团并确信地预期将会得到友好和有益的响应的。
    本代表团坚定地认为，两国之间的贸易应迅速地扩大，不应该受到不合理的禁运所限制，在两国之间应该有更自由的人民的来往和消息的交流，我们的不同的政治制度之间的共处是可能的。
    最后，我们相信由于我们的访问中国，我们协助了许多中国人民对英国人民在当前国际事务上的一般看法有比较清楚的认识及更友好的了解。
