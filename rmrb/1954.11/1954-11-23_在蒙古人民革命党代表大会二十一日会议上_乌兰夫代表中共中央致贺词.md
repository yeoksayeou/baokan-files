Comrades:

    First, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, to extend warm, heartfelt, and fraternal congratulations to the Congress, to the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and to the Mongolian people.

    The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party is convened at a time when the Mongolian people are united as one around the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to strive for the realization of the Second Five-Year Plan. Undoubtedly, this Congress will generate new strength and bring new victories to the socialist construction of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party is the glorious organizer and inspirer of the Mongolian people's revolutionary victory and the construction of the Mongolian nation. Led by the most outstanding sons of the Mongolian people, Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan, and with the selfless and sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, as early as 1921, led the Mongolian people to break free from centuries of suffering and the shackles of slavery, completed the revolution against imperialism and feudalism, making Mongolia the first country in Asia to achieve freedom, independence, and happiness, and making the Mongolian people the masters of their own national destiny.

    The path traversed by the Mongolian People's Republic in the past thirty-three years proves that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party is unswervingly advancing in the direction indicated by Lenin and Stalin. Under the guidance of Lenin-Stalin's doctrine, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has led the Mongolian people to establish, develop, and consolidate the people's democratic state system. The Mongolian people have long had their own constitution and, in accordance with the constitution, have implemented a universal, equal, and direct election system. These developments and achievements in the democratization of the state system of the Mongolian People's Republic ensure that the urban and rural working masses of Mongolia can most actively participate in the management of state affairs, and promote a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative spirit in the struggle to realize socialist construction. In the elections to the Mongolian Great People's Hural held on June 13 this year, 99.95 percent of Mongolian voters participated in the elections, and the candidates of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the non-party alliance received the support of 99.89 percent of the total number of voters. This proves the infinite love and trust of the Mongolian people in the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and proves that the Mongolian people are united as one.

    Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, especially the main sector of the Mongolian national economy—animal husbandry—has been further developed. Other sectors of the Mongolian national economy are also constantly rising, industry is being established and growing, and the ranks of the emerging working class are growing. From 1940 to 1953, the quantity of Mongolian industrial products increased by 270 percent. During the five years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the level of Mongolian industrial production will increase by about 46 percent. Many new factories and enterprises will be established one after another. At the same time, the modernization of Mongolia's transportation network is also developing and improving. All of this shows that the Mongolian people will surely win the victory of socialist construction.

    On the basis of economic development, the material and cultural life of the Mongolian people is also becoming increasingly rich and improved. The national income of the Mongolian People's Republic is increasing day by day, and the retail sales of commodities are constantly expanding. Cultural and educational undertakings have also been widely developed. Illiteracy has been eliminated on the land of the Republic. The new culture with its own national form and socialist content is shining its own brilliance in the cultural garden of progressive mankind.

    Dear comrades, the Chinese people are as jubilant and encouraged as if they were experiencing it themselves about these great developments and brilliant achievements that the Mongolian people have achieved in the past thirty-three years. Like the Mongolian people, we are proud of these developments and achievements, which vividly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the social system of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    The fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples is built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism. In the most difficult days of the Chinese people, in our struggle against Japanese imperialist aggression, and during our decisive battles with reactionary forces at home and abroad, we received sympathy and assistance from Mongolia. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship has been developing and strengthening under completely new conditions. The Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed on October 4, 1952, has brought our two countries closer together. After the completion of the railway from Beijing via Jining to Ulaanbaatar, exchanges between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples will be more convenient and frequent. Both the Mongolian and Chinese peoples are peace-loving and anti-aggression peoples. The Mongolian and Chinese peoples will stand closely with the peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, jointly defending Asian and world peace, building our beautiful socialist future, and resolutely and unremittingly striving to realize our common grand ideals. Our strength is invincible.

    Dear comrades, finally, please allow us to convey the following congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Congress:

    "The 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm and fraternal greetings to the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party!

    The Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, have achieved remarkable accomplishments in developing and consolidating the people's democratic system, promoting the continuous development of all sectors of the national economy, and striving to improve the material and cultural life of the people, and are confidently and resolutely striving to complete the Second Five-Year Plan.

    We warmly and sincerely congratulate the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on achieving new and greater achievements in uniting the Mongolian people and strengthening its own ranks, in striving for the victorious construction of socialist cause and in the struggle to defend world peace.

    Long live the organizer and inspirer of all the victories of the Mongolian People's Revolution—the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party!

    Long live the close and inseparable friendly unity between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet, Chinese, and Mongolian peoples!

                    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"

    在蒙古人民革命党代表大会二十一日会议上
    乌兰夫代表中共中央致贺词亲爱的同志们：
    首先，请允许我代表中国共产党中央委员会和中国人民向大会、向蒙古人民革命党、向蒙古人民致以热烈的、衷心的和兄弟般的祝贺。
    蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会是在蒙古人民举国一致团结在蒙古人民革命党的周围为实现第二个五年计划而奋斗的时候召开的。无疑的，这次大会必将产生新的力量，给蒙古人民共和国的社会主义建设事业带来新的胜利。
    蒙古人民革命党是领导蒙古人民革命获得胜利和建设蒙古国家的光荣的组织者和鼓舞者。以蒙古人民的最优秀的儿子苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山为首，在伟大苏联无私的、真诚的帮助下，蒙古人民革命党早在一九二一年就领导蒙古人民挣脱了几世纪以来的痛苦和奴役的锁链，完成了反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命，使蒙古成为在亚洲第一个获得自由、独立和幸福的国家，并使蒙古人民成为主宰他们自己国家命运的主人。
    三十三年以来，蒙古人民共和国所走过的道路证明，蒙古人民革命党是坚贞不渝地按照列宁—斯大林所指示的方向前进。在列宁—斯大林学说的指导之下，蒙古人民革命党领导蒙古人民建立、发展和巩固了人民民主的国家制度。蒙古人民早已有了自己的宪法，并根据宪法实行了普遍、平等的直接选举制度。蒙古人民共和国在国家制度民主化方面的这些发展和成就保证了蒙古城乡劳动群众能够最积极地参加国家事务的管理，在实现社会主义建设事业的斗争中发扬高度的劳动热情和创造精神。在今年六月十三日举行的蒙古大人民呼拉尔的选举中，蒙古百分之九十九点九五的选民参加了选举，蒙古人民革命党和非党联盟的候选人得到了占选民总数百分之九十九、八九的选票拥护。这就证明蒙古人民对蒙古人民革命党的无限爱戴和信任，证明蒙古人民团结得像一个人一样。
    在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在伟大苏联的兄弟般的帮助下，蒙古人民共和国的国民经济，特别是蒙古国民经济的主要部门—畜牧业有了进一步的发展。蒙古国民经济的其他部门也在不断的高涨，工业正在建立和成长起来，新兴的工人阶级的队伍正在日益壮大。从一九四○年到一九五三年间蒙古工业产品数量增加了百分之二百七十。在第二个五年计划的五年当中，蒙古工业生产水平将要提高约百分之四十六。许多新的工厂和企业将一个接着一个建立起来。与此同时，蒙古交通运输网的现代化也在发展和改善。这一切说明蒙古人民一定能够赢得建设社会主义的胜利。
    在经济发展的基础上，蒙古人民的物质和文化的生活也在日益丰富和提高。蒙古人民共和国的国民收入正在日益增加，商品零售额正在不断扩大。文化教育事业也有了广泛的发展。文盲已经在共和国的土地上消灭。具有蒙古人民自己的民族形式和社会主义内容的新的文化，在进步人类的文化园地里放出它自己的光彩。
    亲爱的同志们，中国人民对蒙古人民三十三年来所获得的这些巨大发展和辉煌成就如同切身感受一样地感到欢欣鼓舞。对于这些发展和成就，我们同蒙古人民一样感到骄傲，这些发展和成就，生动地证明了以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的社会制度的无比优越性。
    蒙古人民和中国人民间的兄弟般的友谊是建筑在马克思、列宁主义的基础之上的，在中国人民最艰苦的日子里，在我们抵抗日本帝国主义侵略的斗争中，在我们同国内外反动势力进行决定性的战斗的期间，我们都从蒙古得到同情和援助。中华人民共和国成立以来，这种友谊正在完全新的条件下发展和加强。一九五二年十月四日签订的中蒙经济及文化合作协定，使我们两国关系更加密切起来，由北京经集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路建成以后，中蒙两国人民的往来将更加便利和频繁。蒙古人民和中国人民都是酷爱和平和反对侵略的人民。中蒙两国人民将紧紧地和以苏联为首的和平民主力量站在一起，共同为捍卫亚洲和世界和平，为建设我们美好的社会主义的未来，为实现我们共同的远大理想而坚决地、不懈地奋斗。我们的力量是不可战胜的。
    亲爱的同志们，最后，请允许我们转达中国共产党中央委员会致大会的下列祝词：
    “蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会：
    中国共产党中央委员会向蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼！
    蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在伟大苏联无私的帮助下，在发展和巩固人民民主制度方面，在促进国民经济一切部门不断发展和努力提高人民的物质和文化生活方面，已获得了卓越的成就，并正在满怀信心地为完成第二个五年计划而坚决地奋斗。
    我们热烈地、衷心地祝贺蒙古人民革命党在团结蒙古人民和壮大自己的队伍的工作中，在争取胜利建设社会主义事业和保卫世界和平的斗争中，获得新的更大的成就。
    蒙古人民革命一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——蒙古人民革命党万岁！
    蒙古人民和中国人民亲密无间的友好团结万岁！
    伟大的苏联、中国和蒙古人民间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
                  中国共产党中央委员会”
                    （新华社乌兰巴托讯）
