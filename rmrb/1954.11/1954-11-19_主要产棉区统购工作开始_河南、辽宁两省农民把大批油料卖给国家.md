Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The unified purchase of cotton has begun in all major cotton-producing areas across the country. This year, the cotton market season is slightly later than last year. The quantity of cotton entering the market gradually increased in most areas from October onwards. According to incomplete statistics, in the sixteen cotton-producing provinces and cities (suburban areas) across the country, the amount of cotton purchased by the state through unified purchase in September and October has reached 88% of the amount purchased during the same period last year. Among them, Sichuan Province, which has completed the unified purchase plan relatively well, has completed 158.7% of the plan; Shaanxi Province has completed 116.6% of the unified purchase plan. Since October, the amount of cotton purchased in various cotton-producing areas across the country has increased rapidly, with an average increase of 7% in mid-October compared to early October, and an average increase of more than two times in late October compared to mid-October.

This year, the cotton harvest in several major cotton-producing areas is good. The yield per unit area is generally higher than originally planned. Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province is expected to increase production by about 11% compared to the original plan. Some areas of Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces generally increased production by about 10% to 20%. The quality of new cotton this year is generally higher than last year. The lint percentage reaches 34% to 37%; the fiber length is mostly above one inch. Many supply and marketing cooperatives, in response to changes in cotton quality this year, have implemented policies of pricing according to quality and paying higher prices for better cotton, which has been welcomed by cotton farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: Henan Province has had a bumper peanut harvest this year, estimated to yield over 124,000 tons of peanut kernels, exceeding the planned output by 20%. The peanut kernels are plump, with a high kernel yield, and the quality is also better than in previous years. Although Xinyang and Nanyang prefectures, which are rich in sesame seeds, suffered varying degrees of flooding this year, farmers, with the help of the local people's government, actively drained waterlogged areas, applied additional fertilizers, and strengthened field management, still achieved a certain harvest. Currently, it is the peak season for oil crops to enter the market in large quantities. From late September to the end of October, the state has purchased 2,982 tons of peanut kernels (including some peanut oil converted) and 16,639 tons of sesame seeds (including some sesame oil converted) in Henan Province.

In order to do a good job in the unified purchase of oil crops, the Henan Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Company has built warehouses with a capacity of 1,000 tons to 500 tons in five key producing areas, including Xinyang and Puyang, and prepared various packaging materials, strengthening storage and management work. The purchased oil crops will be successively transferred to major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and processing factories. The province's October sesame transfer plan has been completed by 148.9%.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th: Farmers in Xinjin, Fuxian, Suizhong and other counties in Liaoning Province, which are major economic crop areas, have begun to sell various oil crops to the state.

Since November, more than 1,500 tons of oil crops have been entering the market in the province every day. Farmers in Shenyang, Suizhong and other places sell more than 400,000 catties of peanuts to the state every day. Suizhong County's October peanut purchase exceeded the plan by 190 tons.

This year, Liaoning Province has had a bumper harvest of oil crops. The output of peanuts, the main product, has increased by more than 60% compared to last year, and the output of sesame has also increased compared to last year. Now farmers are busy picking, sorting, and drying, preparing to sell high-quality oil crops to the state.

    主要产棉区统购工作开始
    河南、辽宁两省农民把大批油料卖给国家
    【新华社十八日讯】全国各主要产棉区棉花统购工作已经开始。今年棉花上市季节比去年稍晚，大部地区进入十月份以来，棉花上市的数量才逐渐增多。据不完全统计，全国十六个产棉省和市（郊区），九、十两个月国家统购的棉花已相当去年同期购棉数量的百分之八十八。其中统购计划完成较好的四川省，已完成计划百分之一百五十八点七；陕西省已完成统购计划的百分之一百一十六点六。十月以来，全国各产棉区收购数量增加很快，十月中旬比上旬平均增加百分之七，下旬比中旬平均增加两倍多。
    今年，几个主要产棉地区的棉花收成情况良好。单位面积产量一般都比原计划提高。河北省邯郸专区预计可比原计划增产百分之十一左右。山东、陕西、河南等省的部分地区一般约增产一成到二成。今年新棉的质量普遍比去年提高。衣分率达百分之三十四到三十七；绒长大都在一英寸以上。不少供销合作社针对今年棉花质量的变化情况，贯彻依质论价、优棉优价政策，受到棉农的欢迎。
    【新华社郑州十八日电】河南省今年花生丰收，估计可以收获花生米十二万四千吨以上，超过计划产量百分之二十。花生颗粒饱满，出仁率大，质量也比往年好。今年盛产芝麻的信阳、南阳专区虽然遭受不同程度的水灾，但后来在当地人民政府帮助下，农民们积极排除渍水、追施肥料，加强田间管理工作等，仍然获得了一定的收成。目前正是油料大量上市季节。从九月下旬到十月底，国家在河南省已收购花生米二千九百八十二吨（一部分花生油折算在内）、芝麻一万六千六百三十九吨（一部分芝麻油折算在内）。
    为了做好油料统购工作，中国油脂公司河南省公司已在信阳、濮阳等五个重点产区兴建容量一千吨到五百吨的仓库，并准备了各种包装用具，加强了储存保管工作。已收购的油料，将陆续向北京、天津等大城市和加工工厂调运。全省十月份芝麻外调计划已完成百分之一百四十八点九。
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】辽宁省主要经济作物地区新金、复县、绥中等县农民，开始向国家出售各种油料。
    十一月以来，全省每天上市的油料作物都在一千五百吨以上。沈阳、绥中等地农民，每天卖给国家的花生都在四十万斤以上。绥中县十月份收购的花生超过计划一百九十吨。
    今年辽宁省的油料作物普遍丰收，主要产品——花生的产量比去年增加百分之六十以上，芝麻的产量也比去年增加。现在农民们正忙着摘拣和晾晒，准备把质量好的油料都卖给国家。
