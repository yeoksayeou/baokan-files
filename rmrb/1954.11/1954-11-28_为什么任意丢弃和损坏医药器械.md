Why Arbitrarily Discard and Damage Medical Equipment

To the Editor:

    The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce recently discovered, during inspection work, that the Xinjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company had a large number of expired and ineffective drugs, and damaged medical equipment. According to preliminary statistics, there were a total of 1,185 items lost, with just microscopes, early-onset estron, Vogulin, and thrombin injection alone accounting for a loss of over 66 million yuan. The loss of drugs and medical equipment is mainly due to improper placement and poor storage. This company has a basement filled with old bottles of medicines and equipment that has not been used for years, yet they constantly complain about insufficient warehouse space, leaving large quantities of drugs exposed to the elements for extended periods, subjected to rain and sun. For example, more than 2,700 boxes of thrombin injection, with "Refrigerated Product" clearly marked on the boxes, were completely deteriorated due to prolonged exposure. Furthermore, items like disinfection trays, hemostatic forceps, surgical scissors, complete sets of surgical instruments, over 3,700 dental drill bits, and over 2,000 needles were originally in good condition, but because they were left unattended in the warehouse, some had rusted and deteriorated.

    This company has an irresponsible attitude towards the handling of damaged and waste products, and they categorize some perfectly good commodities as damaged and waste. Among the 308 types of damaged and waste products inspected, 51 types were perfectly usable. For example, white donkey-hide gelatin and vitamins with complete packaging were simply discarded into the waste pile because the cardboard boxes were slightly soiled. Two microscopes were classified as waste products. One of them was complete, and the other could have been used for teaching experiments with minor repairs, but both met an unfortunate fate.

    We believe that this company's behavior of arbitrarily discarding and damaging valuable state property is intolerable. We hope that through the handling of this incident, they will earnestly improve their leadership and work.

    为什么任意丢弃和损坏医药器械编辑同志：
    新疆省人民政府商业厅最近在检查工作中，发现新疆省医药分公司大批药品变质失效，医疗器械遭到损坏的事情。据初步统计，共损失一千一百八十五种，其中仅显微镜、早发夕安、沃古林和凝血质注射液等四种就损失达六千六百多万元。药品和医疗器械的损失，主要是因为放置不当，保管不善。这个公司有一个地下室，堆放着很多旧瓶药械，几年来不予利用，却经常叫喊仓库不足，把大批药品长期堆放在露天里，任凭雨淋日晒。如二千七百多盒凝血质注射液，箱上明明写着“冷藏品”，经过长期的曝晒，结果全部变质。又如消毒盘、止血钳、手术剪刀、整套的外科器械，三千七百余支牙科钻头，二千多支针头等，原来都是好的，因为搁在仓库里无人过问，以致有些已经生锈变质。
    这个公司在处理残、废品的工作上存在着不负责任的态度，他们把有些完好的商品一律被列成了残、废品。经过检查的三百零八种残、废品中，就有五十一种是完好可用的。如白阿胶、维生素等，包装都是完整的，只是纸盒上有点污损，就被扔到废品堆里。有两架被列为残品的显微镜，其中一架是完整的，另一架只要稍加修理，还可以作为教学实验之用，可是，它们都遭到了不幸的命运。
    我们认为，这个公司这种任意丢弃和损坏国家宝贵财产的行为是不能容忍的，希望他们通过这一事件的处理，切实改进领导，改进工作。  中国医药公司一职员
