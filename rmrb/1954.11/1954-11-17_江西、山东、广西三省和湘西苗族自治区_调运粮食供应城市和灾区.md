Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: In the past four months, Jiangxi Province has transferred more than 400 million jin of rice to disaster areas in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces, as well as to cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Lüda, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This year, in addition to meeting the needs of its own people, Jiangxi Province can transfer 1 billion jin of rice to support other regions. Currently, over 300 rice processing plants across the province are processing grain, and a large number of trucks and ships are daily loaded with grain heading towards the Zhe-Gan and Nan-Xun railway lines.

This year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, farmers in Jiangxi Province launched an increase production and practice economy movement, and fought against severe droughts and floods, ensuring a good harvest of early and mid-season rice in most areas, and a good harvest of late rice as well. The grain output of the Gan-nan Administrative Region and the Fuzhou and Ji'an Special Districts has increased significantly compared to last year. Although some areas in the Shangrao, Nanchang, and Jiujiang Special Districts suffered disasters, their grain output also increased compared to last year. Now, farmers in these areas are selling surplus grain and paying agricultural tax to the state. As of November 10th, farmers across the province had sold over 1.13 billion jin of rice to the state. Farmers in twelve counties in the Ji'an Special District had already delivered all their agricultural tax to the state granaries by the end of October. Guangfeng, Dongxiang, Qianshan, Shangrao, Yushan and other counties have now completed or are nearing completion of their grain requisition and purchase tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th: A large amount of wheat sold to the state by farmers in Shandong Province is being continuously transported to Tianjin, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast. From July to early November this year, the amount of wheat transferred to Tianjin, the Northeast, and other regions was 600 million jin more than the total amount of wheat transferred in the second half of last year.

This year, Shandong Province had a bumper harvest of wheat, with an increase of more than 1.65 billion jin compared to last year. By the end of October, the amount of wheat sold by farmers exceeded the state's wheat purchase plan by 53 percent. The wheat controlled by the state grain departments in Shandong Province, in addition to supplying the province, has more surplus wheat for outward transfer than in previous years. From the beginning of the new wheat purchase, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Grain Department has systematically concentrated wheat dispersed in rural grassroots granaries to storage areas along the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways and coastal ports, in preparation for timely outward transfer.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th: This year is the second year that Guangxi Province has surplus grain for outward transfer. The total amount of surplus grain transferred outward for the whole year has increased by about 57 percent compared to last year, with the amount transferred outward in the fourth quarter increasing significantly compared to the third quarter. The main grain transferred outward is rice, followed by beans and corn. The transfer destinations include major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. The Mongolian people on the Inner Mongolian grasslands and farmers in disaster areas in Hubei and other provinces have also eaten Guangxi rice.

Before liberation, people in Guangxi had to eat grain transported from other places. As a result of the efforts of farmers across the province to increase production after liberation, self-sufficiency was achieved in 1952, and surplus grain was transferred outward in 1953. This year, various grain crops in Guangxi Province have reported bumper harvests. The plan to increase production by 1.8 billion jin of grain is nearing completion. The total grain output has surpassed last year. Tens of thousands of people of various ethnic groups in the province are transporting surplus grain from remote mountainous areas to transportation lines, and then transporting it out by rail and road.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region in Hunan Province has transported more than 1.6 million jin of rice to support the Dongting Lake levee and embankment repair project. This year, the autonomous region's rice output increased by approximately 10 million jin compared to last year, not only reversing the phenomenon of importing grain from other places before liberation, but also having a surplus of grain that can be transferred outward.

    江西、山东、广西三省和湘西苗族自治区
    调运粮食供应城市和灾区
    【新华社南昌十六日电】最近四个月中，江西省调运了四亿多斤大米到江苏、安徽等省灾区和北京、上海、武汉、旅大等城市以及内蒙古自治区。今年江西省生产的粮食除了满足本省人民需要外，还可以调出十亿斤大米支援其他地区。现在全省三百多个大米加工厂正在进行粮食加工，大批汽车和船只每天满载着粮食驶向浙赣、南浔两条铁路线。
    今年，江西省的农民在中国共产党和人民政府领导下展开增产节约运动，和水旱灾害作了严重的斗争，保证了大部分地区早、中稻丰收，晚稻的收成也很好。赣南行政区和抚州、吉安等专区今年粮食产量比去年增加很多。上饶、南昌、九江等三个专区虽然有些地方受了灾害，但粮食产量也比去年增加。现在这些地区的农民正在向国家出卖余粮和缴纳公粮。到十一月十日止，全省农民卖给国家的大米已有十一亿三千多万斤。吉安专区十二个县的农民在十月底已把全部公粮送入国家粮库。广丰、东乡、铅山、上饶、玉山等县现在也已完成或接近完成征粮购粮任务。
      【新华社济南十六日电】山东省农民卖给国家的大量小麦，源源运往天津、内蒙古和东北等地。今年七月至十一月上旬调往天津、东北等地的小麦，比去年下半年调出小麦的总数还多六亿斤。
    今年，山东省的小麦获得大丰收，比去年增产十六亿五千万斤以上。到十月底，农民卖出的小麦超过国家收购小麦计划的百分之五十三。山东省国家粮食部门控制的小麦，除供应本省外，有比往年更多的剩余小麦外调。从开始收购新小麦，山东省人民政府粮食厅就有计划地把分散在农村基层粮仓的小麦，陆续集中到津浦、胶济铁路沿线和沿海港口存储，以备及时向外调运。
    【新华社南宁十六日电】今年是广西省有余粮外运的第二年，全年外运的余粮比去年增加百分之五十七左右，其中第四季度外运数量又比第三季度增加很多。外运的粮食主要是大米，其次是豆类和玉米。调运地区有北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州等大城市。内蒙古草原上的蒙族人民和湖北等省灾区的农民也吃到了广西的大米。
    解放前广西人要吃从外地运来的粮食，解放后全省农民努力增产的结果，一九五二年达到自给，一九五三年有余粮外运。今年广西省各种粮食作物都告丰收。增产十八亿斤粮食的计划接近完成。粮食总产量超过去年。外运余粮的数量也比去年增加。省内成千上万的各族农民把余粮从偏僻的山区运送到交通线上，然后由铁路公路运输出来。
    【新华社长沙十六日电】湖南省湘西苗族自治区已运出一百六十多万斤大米支援修复洞庭湖堤垸工程。今年，自治区的稻谷比去年约增产一千多万斤，不仅改变了解放前由外地输入粮食的现象，还有一批余粮可以外运。
