Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: The Aid Korea and Vietnam Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting in Berlin on the 11th. Several hundred representatives from the district branches of the German Democratic Republic and representatives from West Berlin attended the meeting. The meeting elected a new leadership body of the committee and discussed the work plan. More than eighty people, including Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, were elected as members.

The meeting adopted a letter to the people of the German Democratic Republic. The letter said that since the establishment of the Aid Korea Committee in 1950, a total of 36 million marks in donations and goods in kind have been collected. After the Geneva Conference, this committee was reorganized into the Aid Korea and Vietnam Committee.

Speaking of the fact that the aid to Korea and Vietnam movement embodies internationalism, the letter to the people said: "When we assist the people of Korea and Vietnam, we also mean to thank them. The glorious example of the heroic people of these two countries in the Far East increases our confidence in the struggle to safeguard our nation's right to exist."

After the meeting, forty-three carriages loaded with the second batch of aid to Korea and Vietnam this year—medical equipment, ambulances, agricultural machinery, textiles, etc.—left the station amidst cheers from the masses. The first batch of 60 carriages of aid to Korea this year was shipped in May. These aid supplies were donated by the working people of the German Democratic Republic or voluntarily manufactured in factories through overtime work.

    【新华社柏林十二日电】民主德国全国阵线援助朝鲜和越南委员会十一日在柏林举行会议。参加会议的有德意志民主共和国各专区分会的代表和来自西柏林的代表数百人。会议选举了委员会新的领导机构，并讨论了工作计划。德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼等八十多人当选为委员。
    会议通过了告德意志民主共和国人民书。告人民书说：援朝委员会从一九五零年成立以来，共募集了三千六百万马克捐款和实物。日内瓦会议后，这个委员会改组为援助朝鲜和越南委员会。
    告人民书在谈到援朝、援越运动是国际主义的体现时说：“我们在援助朝鲜和越南人民时，也有对他们感谢的意思。远东这两国英勇人民的光辉榜样增进着我们为保障我国民族生存权利的斗争的信心。”
    会后，装载着今年第二批援助朝鲜和越南的物资——医疗器材、救护车、农业机器和纺织品等——的四十三节车厢在群众的欢呼声中开出了车站。今年第一批援朝物资六十车厢是在五月间运出的。这些援助物资都是德意志民主共和国劳动人民捐献或在工厂中志愿加班制造出来的。
