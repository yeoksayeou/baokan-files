Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd: Heilongjiang Province is making preparations for the year-round development of agricultural production cooperatives. This year, the province's cooperative establishment work will end in mid-November, earlier than in previous years, so that the newly established cooperatives can prepare for unified management and collective production as early as possible for next year. This winter, the number of farm households in Heilongjiang Province participating in agricultural production cooperatives, together with the existing 350,000 agricultural production cooperative members, will reach 35% of the province's total farm households. In early October, the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of rural work ministers from various counties to review the preparations for the major development of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, and determined the above-mentioned development targets and steps.

The province has been conducting preparations for the development of agricultural production cooperatives in a regular, led, planned, and step-by-step manner. It has universally investigated and analyzed the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement from the bottom up, formulated plans for the development of agricultural production cooperatives, and selected and cultivated a group of mutual aid teams as targets for cooperative establishment. At the same time, from the top down, it has strengthened the study of the principles and policies for developing agricultural production cooperatives and the business knowledge of establishing and running cooperatives, and trained a large number of leading cadres. This spring, in the process of establishing cooperatives, various localities adopted the method of "establishing cooperatives while training," cultivating several thousand mutual aid teams as targets for cooperative establishment. By the time of summer hoeing, the number of mutual aid teams for establishing cooperatives had increased to 16,000 to 17,000. They actively learned from the experience of establishing and running cooperatives through mutual aid and cooperation networks, visits, and the signing of contact contracts with existing agricultural production cooperatives. The province made use of production gaps in each season, with county and district party and government leading organs responsible for training more than 68,000 backbone members for cooperative establishment, including those who will serve as directors, accountants, production team leaders of cooperatives, and district and village cadres who lead cooperatives.

In the preparation work for establishing cooperatives, in light of the new situations that occurred in many places, such as competing for cooperative members, concentrating backbone forces, squeezing out poor households, and the collapse of teams after establishing cooperatives, the advanced experience of implementing overall planning for the development of agricultural production cooperatives created by the Huaiqin Village Branch of the Shuangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China was promoted. This not only overcame the above-mentioned phenomena but also laid the foundation for the long-term, planned development of agricultural production.

After summer hoeing, according to the instructions of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, counties established cooperatives in batches as they matured, and a total of more than 6,900 agricultural production cooperatives were established. At the same time, old cooperatives also absorbed a group of new members. These new cooperatives, built after long-term preparation, generally have the characteristics of a good foundation, sufficient preparation, strong backbone, high morale, and good production, and have accumulated preliminary experience for large-scale cooperative establishment after the autumn harvest. Now, the newly established cooperatives and the mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest have done a good job in autumn harvesting, which is an important reason for the fast harvest progress and less grain loss this year. At the same time, they have also carried out preparations for next year's production, such as autumn plowing, seed selection, opening up autumn wasteland, expanding the area cultivated with new-style farm tools, and converting dry land into paddy fields.

    黑龙江省把发展农业合作社作为常年工作
    【新华社哈尔滨三日电】黑龙江省进行常年发展农业生产合作社的准备工作。今年全省建社工作将比往年提前在十一月中旬结束，使新建社及早为明年实行统一经营、集体生产做好准备。今冬黑龙江省参加农业生产合作社的农户，连同现有的三十五万多户农业生产合作社社员，将达到占全省总农户的百分之三十五。十月上旬，中共黑龙江省委员会农村工作部召开了各县农村工作部长会议，检查了秋后农业生产合作社大发展准备工作情况，确定了上述发展指标和步骤。
    全省常年有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行了发展农业生产合作社的准备工作，自下而上普遍地调查、分析了互助合作运动的发展状况，制了发展农业生产合作社的计划，选择、培养了一批互助组为建社对象；同时，自上而下地加强了对发展农业生产合作社方针、政策和建社、办社业务知识的学习，训练了大批领导骨干。今春各地在建社中，采取“边建社边培养”的办法，培养了几千个互助组为建社对象，到夏锄建社时，建社的互助组增加到一万六、七千个。他们通过互助合作网、参观和同原有农业生产合作社订立联系合同等办法，积极学习建社、办社经验。全省利用各季生产空隙，由县、区两级党政领导机关负责训练了六万八千多名建社骨干分子，包括将担任合作社的主任、会计、生产队长和领导合作社的区、村干部。
    在建社准备工作中，还根据很多地方发生了争社员、骨干集中、排挤贫困户、建社垮组等新情况，推广了中共双城县会勤村支部所创造的发展农业生产合作社实行全面规划的先进经验。这样做，不但克服了上述现象，还为长期有计划地发展农业生产打下了基础。
    夏锄后，各县根据中共黑龙江省委的指示，成熟一批建一批，共建成了六千九百多个农业生产合作社，同时老社也吸收了一批新社员。这些经过长期准备而建成的新社，一般都具有基础好、准备充分、骨干强、情绪高和生产好的特点，并为秋后大规模建社积累了初步经验。现在，已建成的新社和准备秋后建社的互助组，秋收工作都做得较好，是今年收割进度快，少损失粮食的一个重要原因。同时他们还进行了秋翻地、选种、开秋荒和扩大新式农具耕作面积、旱田改水田等明年生产的准备工作。
