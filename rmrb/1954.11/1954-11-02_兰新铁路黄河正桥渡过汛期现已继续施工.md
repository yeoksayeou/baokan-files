    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge Overcomes Flood Season and Resumes Construction
    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge, where construction was temporarily halted during the flood season, has safely passed the flood season and resumed construction on October 18th.

    From the start of construction on April 1st to the beginning of the flood season at the end of June, the Yellow River Bridge had completed the foundations of the east and west bridge abutments and the No. 1, 7, and 8 piers, accounting for more than 30% of the total project. Long before the flood season, the bridge builders had made all preparations for flood prevention. In June, they moved the steel beams, bridge decks, wooden boats of the construction pontoon bridge, as well as the machinery and materials on the east and west banks, to safe areas above the flood level. The bridge builders all participated in flood prevention organizations, ready to carry out water rescue at any time. In late June, when the flood came early, the caisson of the No. 6 pier was undergoing steam curing, and the water surface was only half a meter away from the scaffolding of the curing boiler, while the curing work was only one-quarter completed. If the work continued, the boiler might be washed away by the water, causing huge losses to the state; if the work was stopped and the boiler was moved away, this would cause the caisson concrete to shrink due to loss of temperature, affecting the quality of the project. Under these circumstances, they worked while standing on the shaky scaffolding, and berthed a large wooden boat with a load capacity of 50 tons next to the boiler, and assigned a dedicated person to observe the water level. In case of emergency, they would use the barge pole on the wooden boat to lift the boiler away. In this way, they finally managed to complete all the curing work.

    After more than three months of the flood season, the foundations of the piers have all reappeared above the water surface. Although the highest flood level this year reached 1546.5 meters, which was three meters higher than the water level during construction, the construction site did not suffer any losses. At present, the workers are busily setting the rubble stones of the No. 7 pier and pouring part of the concrete, and will launch a full-scale mechanized winter construction. (Xi Sheng)

    兰新铁路黄河正桥渡过汛期现已继续施工
    在洪水期间暂时停止施工的兰新铁路黄河正桥已经安全渡过汛期，并于十月十八日继续施工。
    黄河正桥自四月一日开工至六月底洪水期前，已完成东、西两座桥台及一、七、八号三座桥墩基础等工程，占全部工程的百分之三十以上。早在洪水期前，筑桥工人就做好了防洪的一切准备工作。六月份，他们将施工便桥的钢梁、桥面、木船以及东、西两岸的机具、材料都运至洪水位以上的安全地带。筑桥工人都参加了防洪组织，随时准备进行水上抢险。六月下旬，当洪水提前袭来时，六号桥墩沉井正在进行蒸气养生工作，水面距离养生锅炉的脚手架只有半公尺，而养生工作才进行了四分之一。如继续工作，恐怕锅炉被水冲走，给国家造成巨大损失；如停止工作，把锅炉搬走，这会使沉井混凝土因失温而收缩，影响工程质量。在这种情况下，他们一面站在摇晃不稳的脚手架上工作，一面将载重五十吨的大木船泊在锅炉旁，并指派专人察看水位，情况紧急时，就用木船上的扒杆吊走锅炉。这样，他们终于坚持完成了全部养生工作。
    在三个多月的汛期过后，一座座的桥墩基础都已重新露出水面；虽然今年汛期的最高洪水位达到一五四六点五公尺，比施工期间的水位高出三公尺，但工地上没有遭到任何损失。目前，工人们正在紧张地镶砌七号桥墩的片石和灌注一部分混凝土，并将展开全面的机械化冬季施工。  （西生）
