Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: In order to successfully complete the fourth quarter industrial product promotion task and coordinate with agricultural product procurement, the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly issued emergency instructions on November 17th.

The instructions pointed out: Developing industrial and agricultural production and meeting the needs of the people are the common tasks of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. Therefore, both parties must closely combine, help each other, and cooperate, under the unified leadership of the commercial administrative departments, to give full play to the role of the two commercial systems.

Although the commodity allocation and transportation work of state-owned commercial departments has improved, it still needs to be strengthened. The current urgent task of the cooperatives is to quickly take effective measures to organize commodities to meet consumers. In this regard, grassroots cooperatives must give full play to their existing financial capabilities and actively purchase goods from state-owned companies to expand commodity circulation. In the rural market, in addition to completing their own retail plans, cooperatives must also fully utilize and give play to the enthusiasm of existing private retailers by distributing an appropriate amount of goods to them through distribution and consignment sales. Through wholesale business, private merchants in rural areas will be gradually transformed into socialism, industry by industry. In order to facilitate cooperatives to purchase goods from state-owned companies, in counties where state-owned companies have not established wholesale agencies, cooperatives should actively purchase goods directly from state-owned secondary stations or branch companies according to the laws of commodity circulation, and then the county cooperatives will be responsible for wholesale to local private merchants; in places where state-owned commerce has no secondary stations, they can purchase goods from nearby state-owned commercial operating units.

The instructions said that in order to properly arrange the market, transform private merchants, increase the socialist accumulation of cooperatives, and better serve the members, it is entirely necessary to gradually achieve consistency between cooperative retail prices and state-owned retail prices in the future. When making adjustments, it is necessary to proceed steadily, meticulously, and systematically to gradually change the phenomenon of inverted urban and rural prices of many commodities.

The instructions said that under the principle of state-owned commerce's unified planning and leadership of the market, cooperatives should strengthen wholesale business. They should actively purchase and promote the products of urban and rural individual handicraftsmen and production cooperatives. Cooperatives should actively purchase and promote industrial products that state-owned companies do not operate or supply insufficiently, and actively operate small local products that state-owned specialized companies do not operate or cannot handle.

In order to solve some of the current urban and rural stagnation phenomena, all localities should immediately organize elementary market material exchange meetings, hosted by state-owned commerce and cooperatives, and with the participation of small merchants and vendors, focusing on the promotion of industrial products, handicrafts, and small local products, to better complete the tasks of promotion and procurement.

    商业部和合作总社联合发出紧急指示
    配合收购工作积极推销工业品
    据新华社二十三日讯：商业部和供销合作总社为胜利完成第四季度工业品推销任务，以配合农产品收购，在十一月十七日联合发出紧急指示。
    指示指出：发展工农业生产和满足人民的需要，是国营商业和合作社商业的共同任务。因此，双方必须密切结合，互助合作，在商业行政部门的统一领导下，充分发挥两个商业系统的作用。
    目前国营商业部门的商品调运工作虽已有所改进，但仍需继续加强。合作社当前的迫切任务是要迅速采取有效措施，组织商品和消费者见面。在这方面，基层合作社要充分发挥现有资金能力，积极向国营公司进货，以扩大商品流转。合作社在农村市场上，除完成自己的零售计划外，还必须充分利用和发挥现有私营零售商贩的积极性，通过经销、代销的办法批给他们适当数量的商品。通过批发业务有步骤地、分行分业地对农村私商进行社会主义改造。为便利合作社向国营公司进货，在国营公司未设置批发机构的县，合作社应根据商品流转规律积极向国营二级站或分公司直接进货，再由县合作社负责对当地私商进行批发；在国营商业未设二级站的地方，可向附近的国营商业的经营单位进货。
    指示说，为了便于妥善地安排市场和改造私商，增加合作社社会主义的积累，以便更好地为社员服务，今后逐步做到合作社零售价格和国营零售牌价一致，是完全必要的。在进行调整时，需稳重地、缜密地、有步骤地进行，以逐步改变不少商品城乡价格倒挂的现象。
    指示说，在国营商业统一计划领导市场的原则下，合作社应加强批发业务。对城乡个体手工业者和生产合作社的产品要积极进行收购和推销。国营公司未经营或供应不足的工业品，合作社要积极进行采购和推销，并积极经营国营专业公司不经营或经营不过来的小土产品。
    为解决目前城乡某些阻滞现象，各地应立即组织由国营商业和合作社主持的，吸收小商贩参加的，以推销工业品、手工业品和小土产为主的初级市场物资交流会，更好地完成推销和收购的任务。
