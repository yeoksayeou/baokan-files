    The total output of peanuts across the country's nearly 32 million mu has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest since liberation, with a total output increase of over 41% compared to last year. The average yield per mu has also increased by 37 jin. Currently, peanut harvesting is complete, and they are being successively brought to market. Farmers are enthusiastically selling peanuts to the state.
  The substantial increase in peanut production this year is primarily due to the expansion of the planting area. Many farmers have utilized barren sandy soil, sandy wasteland, or sandy land with low grain crop yields to plant peanuts. According to statistics, the peanut planting area nationwide has expanded by approximately 20.7% compared to last year. Secondly, significant efforts have been made in various regions to improve cultivation techniques. This year, in major peanut-producing areas, over 2 million mu were treated with rhizobium inoculant, more than double the area treated last year. Peanuts treated with rhizobium inoculant generally saw an increase in production of 10% to 15%. In Wendeng and Laiyang prefectures of Shandong Province, the experience of deep plowing, deep hoeing, concentrated application of ditch manure, and ridge-terrace sowing of peanuts has been promoted, yielding good results.

    全国花生总产量比去年增加四成
    【本报讯】全国近三千二百万亩花生，今年获得解放以来未有过的丰收，总产量可比去年增加百分之四十一以上，每亩平均单位面积产量也提高三十七市斤。目前花生已收刨完毕，陆续上市。农民正踊跃把花生卖给国家。
  今年花生大量增产，首先是由于扩大了种植面积。不少农民利用瘠薄的砂性土壤、沙荒或粮食作物产量很低的砂土地种植花生。据统计，全国花生播种面积约比去年扩大了百分之二十点七。其次在改进栽培技术方面，各地也作了不少工作。今年花生主要产区，推广根瘤菌拌种二百多万亩，比去年扩大了两倍多，用根瘤菌拌种的花生，一般都增产百分之十到十五。山东省文登、莱阳等专区，推广了花生深耕深刨、集中施沟粪和打垅台播种的经验，收到了良好效果。
