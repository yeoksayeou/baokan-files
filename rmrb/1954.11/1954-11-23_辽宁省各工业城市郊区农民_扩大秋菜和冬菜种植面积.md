Farmers in Suburban Areas of Industrial Cities in Liaoning Province
Expand Acreage of Autumn and Winter Vegetable Planting

    The cold winter has already descended upon the land of Liaoning Province, but in many greenhouses in the suburbs of industrial cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, and Fuxin, it is as warm as spring. In the greenhouses, cucumbers, green beans, tomatoes, green peppers, chives, garlic sprouts, celery, spinach, and cabbage are growing vigorously. Workers in Anshan have already begun to eat the first batch of tender green chives and garlic sprouts produced in the greenhouses.
    In order to meet the winter vegetable needs of urban workers and people, many state-owned vegetable farms, vegetable production cooperatives, and mutual aid groups have expanded the acreage of autumn and winter vegetable planting. This year, the autumn vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of Anshan has doubled compared to last year, supplying the city with 40 million jin of vegetables; the vegetables prepared for winter consumption have all been stored in cellars, and the greenhouses have also been expanded, which can produce 900,000 jin of vegetables this winter. Shenyang City has newly built and expanded 15,000 square meters of greenhouses, and it is estimated that these greenhouses can produce more than 450,000 jin of vegetables this winter. The various vegetables produced in Dalian City in winter are expected to reach 500,000 jin, more than double that of last year. The Fuxin Mining Bureau Farm also plans to produce more than 50,000 jin of garlic sprouts, chives, tomatoes, etc.
    The winter vegetable production technology in the suburbs of various industrial cities has been improved this year. Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, Fuxin, and other cities have learned from the greenhouse vegetable production experience of Beijing and other cities. Shenyang City did not have fruit and vegetable production in the past, but this year it has also begun trial planting. After learning from Beijing's advanced experience, the Fuxin Mining Bureau Farm plans to use greenhouses to cultivate cucumbers twice this year, requiring the tomatoes to be as large as those grown in summer.
    In order to continuously supply winter vegetables, various cities are actively organizing the storage of autumn vegetables while developing winter vegetable production. According to statistics from sixteen vegetable production cooperatives in Shenyang City, they plan to store more than 3 million jin of various autumn vegetables this year. Anshan City estimates that it can store more than 10 million jin of various vegetables. The autumn vegetables stored in Dalian City and the vegetables produced in winter can basically meet the needs of the entire city this winter and next spring. (Xinhua News Agency)

    辽宁省各工业城市郊区农民
    扩大秋菜和冬菜种植面积
    寒冷的冬天已经降临辽宁省大地，在沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺、阜新等工业城市市郊的许多温室里却和暖如春。在温室中，黄瓜、豆角、西红柿、青椒、韭菜、蒜苗、芹菜、菠菜、白菜正在蓬蓬勃勃地生长。鞍山职工已开始吃到温室内第一批出产的嫩绿的韭菜和蒜苗。
    为满足城市职工和人民冬季蔬菜的需要，许多国营蔬菜农场和蔬菜生产合作社、互助组扩大了秋菜和冬菜种植面积。鞍山市郊今年秋菜播种面积，比去年扩大了一倍，供应城市的蔬菜达四千万斤；准备冬季食用的菜已全部下窖，温室也作了扩建，今冬可生产蔬菜九十万斤。沈阳市新建和扩建了一万五千平方公尺的温室，估计这些温室今冬可以生产四十五万多斤蔬菜。旅大市冬季生产的各种蔬菜，预计可达五十万斤，比去年增加一倍多。阜新矿务局农场也计划生产蒜苗、韭菜、西红柿等五万多斤。
    各工业城市郊区的冬季蔬菜生产技术今年都有改进。沈阳、旅大、抚顺、阜新等市都学习了北京和其他城市的温室蔬菜生产经验。沈阳市过去没有果菜类的生产，今年也开始试种了。阜新矿务局农场学习了北京的先进经验后，今年计划利用温室栽培两次黄瓜，要求西红柿和夏天长的一般大。
    为了不间断地供应冬季蔬菜，目前各城市在发展冬菜生产同时，还积极组织秋菜储藏工作。据沈阳市十六个蔬菜生产合作社统计，今年计划储藏各种秋菜三百多万斤。鞍山市估计可贮藏各种蔬菜一千万斤以上。旅大市储藏的秋菜和冬季生产的蔬菜，基本上可以满足全市今冬明春的需要。（新华社）
