Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th: News from London: The British House of Commons has decided to hold a debate on the "Western European Union" issue on the 17th and 18th. The Churchill government is preparing to ask the House of Commons to approve the Paris Agreements on reviving German militarism and establishing a military bloc that divides Europe and Germany. The Labour Party Parliamentary Group in the House of Commons therefore held secret meetings on the 10th and 11th to discuss its attitude towards the Paris Agreements.

At the beginning of the meeting, Labour leader Attlee spoke first, requesting the meeting to pass a proposal that fully endorsed the Paris Agreements. This proposal was opposed by Bevan, a leader of the Labour Party's left wing, and Member of Parliament Crossman, among others. They argued that a four-power conference should be held to discuss the issue of German reunification before the Paris Agreements came into effect.

The debate at the meeting made the right-wing elements of the Labour Party fear that further discussion would be detrimental to the leadership's policy of supporting the arming of West Germany. They repeatedly attempted to rush the vote in order to hastily end the meeting.

Labour MP George Strauss, proceeding from the need to maintain party unity, suggested that the Labour Party should put forward a "moderate amendment" when the Churchill government asked the House of Commons to approve the Paris Agreements, requiring a four-power conference before the agreements came into effect. This suggestion was rejected by the Labour Party's right-wing elements by a narrow majority of thirty-three votes, but there were still eighty-two votes in favor.

Finally, the Labour Party Parliamentary Group meeting passed the Labour Party leadership's proposal to approve the Paris Agreements by a majority of fifty-two votes. Seventy-two votes were against approving the agreements. Approximately one hundred members of parliament did not participate in the vote. Reuters said: "The Labour Party still has major differences on the issue of rearming West Germany, and this division also extends to the members of the shadow cabinet (the 'shadow cabinet' becomes the formal cabinet once the Labour Party comes to power) itself."

    英国工党议会党团对武装西德问题有分歧
    【新华社十四日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会下院决定在十七日和十八日就“西欧联盟”问题举行辩论。邱吉尔政府准备要求下院批准关于复活德国军国主义、建立分裂欧洲和德国的军事集团的巴黎协定。下院工党议会党团因此在十日和十一日举行了秘密会议，来讨论对巴黎协定的态度。
    工党领袖艾德礼在会议开始时首先发言，要求会议通过完全赞成巴黎协定的建议。这个建议遭到工党左翼领袖比万和议员克罗斯曼等人的反对。他们主张在巴黎协定生效前先举行四国会议来讨论德国统一的问题。
    会议上的争论使得工党右翼分子害怕讨论下去会对领导机构赞成武装西德的政策不利。他们一再企图赶快表决，以便草草结束会议。
    工党议员乔治·斯特劳斯从维护党内团结出发，建议工党应该在邱吉尔政府要求下院批准巴黎协定时提出“温和的修正案”，要求在协定生效前举行四国会议。这个建议被工党右翼分子以三十三票的微弱多数否决了，但是赞成的仍然有八十二票。
    最后，工党议会党团会议以五十二票的多数通过了工党领导机构主张批准巴黎协定的建议。有七十二票反对批准这个协定。有约一百个议员没有参加表决。路透社说：“工党在关于重新武装西德的问题上仍然存在着很大的分歧，这种分歧也扩及在野内阁（工党一旦上台，‘在野内阁’就成为正式内阁）阁员本身。”
