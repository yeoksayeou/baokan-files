In the Hubei Province's Xiaogan Special District, the work of closing breaches and restoring dikes in the counties along the Yangtze River and around the lakes, including Hanchuan, Hanyang, Wuchang, Jiayu, Puqi, Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Huangpi, and Xiaogan, is now being actively carried out. In Hanchuan County, most sections of the main dike of the Han River have emerged from the water, and comprehensive dike restoration is underway, with nearly 60,000 people participating. In Hanyang, the Jitouwan and Caidianzhen areas, which have emerged from the water, are also being repaired. The dike restoration at Jitouwan is 2,000 meters long and requires 60,000 cubic meters of earthwork, of which 20,000 cubic meters have been completed. Other counties have completed the measurement and estimation work for all or most sections of the dikes. In mid-November, the entire district will start construction in full swing, with about 300,000 people participating successively. All counties are actively draining waterlogged farmland and sowing seeds in a timely manner to strive for a bumper harvest next year. (Sun Yijie)
    The returning disaster victims in the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province are actively carrying out a movement to drain waterlogged fields and rush to plant crops. After the disaster victims returned to their hometowns, the local government promptly distributed relief funds and loans, and the supply and marketing cooperatives transferred more than 30 million catties of wheat seeds from other places to help the disaster victims solve the difficulty of seed shortage. Therefore, the disaster victims have a high enthusiasm for draining waterlogged fields and rushing to plant crops, and put forward the slogan of "plant as much as has receded." The eight townships of Luochengwan and Chenggongxiwan in Shishou County joined together to drain 80,000 mu of waterlogged fields, which can be planted with 70,000 mu of wheat. In order to ensure the completion of the winter sowing plan, all the people in Tanshi Township, Jiangling County, launched a drainage movement. Now, the entire special district has closed ten breaches, and drained more than 3.4 million mu of waterlogged fields. More than 2 million mu have been planted with wheat, rapeseed, and other crops. It is expected that the district's winter sowing task of more than 13 million mu will be completed by the end of November.

    湖北省水灾地区努力堵口复堤排水播种
    湖北省孝感专区沿江滨湖的汉川、汉阳、武昌、嘉鱼、蒲圻、云梦、应城、黄陂、孝感等县的堵口复堤工作，现正积极展开。汉川县的汉江干堤大部堤段已退出水面，正在进行全面复堤，上堤人数将近六万。汉阳境内已退出水的矶头湾、蔡甸镇两处也在进行修复，矶头湾处复堤长度达二千公尺，需要土方六万公方，现已完成二万土工公方。其他各县已完成全部堤段或大部堤段的测估工作，十一月中旬，全区即将全面动工，约有三十万人相继参加施工。各县都积极排除农田渍水，及时播种，争取明年丰收。（孙义杰）
    湖北省荆州专区返乡灾民积极开展排渍抢种运动。灾民返乡后，当地政府及时发放了救济款、贷款，供销合作社从外地调运了三千多万斤麦种帮助灾民解决缺种的困难。因此，灾民排渍抢种的情绪很高，提出了“退多少种多少”的口号。石首县罗成垸和陈公西垸八个乡联合起来排出渍田八万亩，可种麦子七万亩。江陵县谭市乡为了保证完成冬播计划，全乡群众开展了排水运动。现在全专区已堵复溃口十处，退出排出渍田三百四十多万亩。并已有二百多万亩播种了麦子、油菜等作物。预计十一月底即可完成全区一千三百多万亩冬播任务。
