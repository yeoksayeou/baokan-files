    Soviet Socialist Agriculture
    Soviet Union, Professor V.M. Rumyantsev
    The great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the regime of landlords and capitalists and established a new, Soviet social system in the country, fundamentally changing the situation of the peasants.

    Before the revolution, 65 percent of individual Russian peasants were poor peasants, and one-third had no land at all. At that time, land-poor and landless peasants were either forced to leave their homes to find work to avoid starvation or endured exploitative rents to rent land from landlords and rich peasants. Before the revolution, there were almost no tractors in Russia. The primitive three-field system, coupled with backward farming methods and animal husbandry, was characteristic of agriculture at the time. This agriculture, which relied entirely on natural forces for its development, suffered from droughts and had very low production.

    The Communist Party was the only political party that fully understood the needs of the Russian working people. It guaranteed the victory of labor over capital and transferred all the wealth of the country into the hands of the working people. The Soviet state handed over 150 million acres of land, previously owned by landlords and capitalists, to the working peasants for their use.

    In the early years of the Soviet regime, the individual small-peasant economy still predominated. This economy could not correctly organize agricultural production, nor could it use advanced agricultural technology, machines, and artificial fertilizers. Under the leadership of their worker-peasant government and the Communist Party, the peasants began to establish the lowest-level cooperative organizations and mutual-aid teams in the first few years after the establishment of the Soviet regime, thereby raising agriculture to a higher stage. Later, in 1929, the peasant masses began to pour into collective farms like a huge wave. Collective farms better combined the individual and public interests of the peasants, opening up broad prospects for the unlimited development of all sectors of agriculture.

    The Soviet peasants advanced towards socialism with confidence. The Soviet state established machine tractor stations with many tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines to serve the collective farms. The Soviet state also established many state-owned agricultural enterprises – state farms – which were huge suppliers of agricultural products. As a result of the industrialization and collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union, the largest and most mechanized socialist agriculture has now been created. Currently, there are a total of 93,000 collective farms, 8,985 machine tractor stations, and 4,857 state farms in the Soviet Union. Each collective farm has an average land area of 5,960 hectares, of which 1,693 hectares are arable land. Each state farm has an average land area of 19,800 hectares, of which 3,100 hectares are arable land.

    In the Soviet Union, about 580 million hectares of land are granted to collective farms for long-term and free use.

    In 1953, the agricultural machinery working in the fields of collective farms and state farms included 1.26 million tractors, 326,000 combine harvesters, 370,000 trucks, and more than 9.5 million other agricultural machines. The mechanization of agriculture in the Soviet Union is developing at an unprecedented rate. In the first half of 1954 alone, agriculture received 92,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 52,000 trucks, 18,000 grain combine harvesters, 15,000 tractor-drawn and self-propelled mowers, and a large number of other agricultural machines.

    The number of agricultural machines is constantly increasing. From 1954 to May 1957, machine tractor stations and state farms will add 500,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 250,000 cultivator tractors.

    These figures are evidence of the enormous potential of Soviet heavy industry. Now, the output of Soviet heavy industry in nine days is equal to the total annual output of Russian industry before the revolution.

    Due to the increase in machinery and equipment, the level of mechanization of agricultural work is also increasing. Compared with 1940, in 1953, the level of mechanization of major tasks in collective farms increased as follows: plowing autumn fallow land increased from 71 percent to 100 percent, autumn sowing increased from 53 percent to 93 percent, and harvesting with combine harvesters increased from 43 percent to 77 percent. The huge increase in the technological equipment of socialist agriculture has created the conditions for complete mechanization, that is, for the complete mechanization of all agricultural work.

    In 1953 alone, agricultural machinery factories in the Soviet Union produced more than 80 types of agricultural machines and tools, including potato harvesting combines for use on hard soil, wide-swath mowers pulled by "DT-54" tractors, silage harvesting combines, and stackers.

    Agriculture in Soviet collective farms has become an agriculture with high technology, productivity, and commodity productivity. The sown area of grain, industrial raw material crops, vegetables, and feed crops has been greatly expanded. Currently, the Soviet Union is sowing 1,673 varieties of grain crops, industrial crops, vegetables, melons, and feed crops. These varieties were all cultivated by Soviet scientists and agricultural innovators.

    The collective farm system guarantees the annual growth of production in all major sectors of agriculture. For example, between 1941 and 1953, the collectively owned livestock of collective farms increased from 54.5 million head to 63 million head. Pigs increased from 27.5 million to 47.6 million, and sheep and goats increased from 91.6 million to 135.9 million.

    The significant increase in the sown area of irrigated agriculture is a great achievement of the collective farm system. Before the October Revolution, the total area of irrigated farmland in the country was about 4 million hectares, which had increased to 6.3 million hectares in 1950. After the huge hydropower stations in Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka generate electricity in 1955-1956, the area of irrigated land will double.

    Along with economic development, the collectively owned property of collective farms has also increased, and the cash and in-kind income of farm members has also increased. In 1953, the cash income of collective farm members increased to 2.4 times that of 1940, and the collective accumulation fund of collective farms increased to 2.5 times. These all illustrate the development and consolidation of collective farms. Compared with 1940, the average real income of collective farm members per capita engaged in agricultural labor in 1953 increased by nearly one time. Due to the new achievements in the development of the collectively owned economy of collective farms, and due to all the measures implemented by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to improve the material interests of collective farms and collective farm members, their real income increased even more in 1954.

    The great strength of collective farm production lies in the fact that it is developed on a reliable scientific basis, because under the conditions of a socialist society, the adoption of all scientific achievements in agricultural production is entirely possible. In solving the tasks facing Soviet agriculture, not only biology and agricultural sciences are used, but also chemistry, physics, technology, and economics.

    The joint efforts of various specialized scientists in the Soviet Union have proved that it is entirely possible to turn barren land into fertile land that continuously increases the production of various crops, and that it is entirely possible to infinitely increase the productivity of animals and plants. Soviet science is closely linked to practice, summarizes the experience of advanced producers, and strives to explore new ways and methods to realize these potentials.

    The work of Comrade Maltsev, an agronomist engaged in scientific research in collective farms, is very important for the further development of socialist agriculture. He proved that under certain conditions, not only perennial crops but also annual crops can improve soil fertility. This made a major correction to the theory of grassland crop rotation in agriculture. He also created more effective cultivation methods, opening up new possibilities for obtaining high and stable yields.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government have greatly enhanced the material and financial guarantees for agriculture and have formulated a broad plan to ensure the smooth resolution of other measures for the nationwide task of further improving socialist agriculture.

    In organizing the rapid improvement of agriculture, the Communist Party and the Soviet government put forward a most important nationwide task, deciding to reclaim 15 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Volga River basin, the Urals, and parts of the North Caucasus to expand the grain sown area. This is equal to half of the total wheat sown area in the United States, or equal to the total wheat sown area of countries that are known as the world's granaries, such as Canada and Argentina. From this, we can see the scale of the reclamation of new land in the southeastern and eastern regions of the Soviet Union in 1954 to 1955.

    The Soviet people are successfully realizing the task of reclaiming virgin and fallow land.

    The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition held in Moscow on August 1 this year extensively reflects the development and achievements of socialist agriculture, and demonstrates the victory of the various policies implemented by the Communist Party in the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture. Those who have obtained the qualifications to participate in the 1954 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition include: 3,110 collective farms, 1,306 state farms, 419 machine tractor stations and specialized technical stations, 3,254 livestock farms, 196 districts, 534 scientific research institutions and experimental institutions, and 134 schools. More than 150,000 advanced producers and agricultural organizers are participants in the exhibition. This fact shows that socialist agriculture is moving forward firmly along the road of progress, and that every collective farm, state farm, and machine tractor station has huge potential for socialist agricultural production that can be brought into play.

    The Soviet people understand their own strength and the correctness of the path they chose in the years of the great October Revolution. They are steadfastly and confidently further improving agriculture, and carrying out constructive work to greatly improve the welfare of the working people and further strengthen the power of the socialist motherland.

    苏联的社会主义农业
    苏联  维·米·鲁米扬采夫教授
    伟大的十月社会主义革命推翻了地主和资本家的政权，在国内建立了新的、苏维埃社会制度后，从根本上改变了农民的状况。
    在革命前，俄国个体农民中有百分之六十五是贫农，三分之一的农民完全没有土地。当时，少地和无地的农民不是迫不得已背井离乡去寻找挣钱的地方以免饿死，便是忍受剥削性的地租去向地主和富农租用土地。革命前，俄国几乎没有拖拉机。原始的三段轮种制，加上落后的耕作方法和落后的畜牧业，是当时农业的特征。这种农业完全依靠自然力来发展，它经受过旱灾，生产量很低。
    共产党是充分了解俄国劳动人民需要的唯一政党，它保证了劳动对资本的胜利，并把国家的一切财富转交到劳动人民的手中。苏维埃国家把先前为地主和资本家所有的一亿五千万俄亩的土地交给劳动农民使用。
    在苏维埃政权最初的年代里，个体小农经济还占着优势。这种经济不可能把农业生产正确地组织起来，也不可能使用先进的农业技术、机器和人造肥料等。在自己的工农政府和共产党的领导下，农民在苏维埃政权成立后的头几年中便开始建立了最低级的合作社组织和共耕社，从而把农业提高到较高的阶段。后来，在一九二九年，农民群众就开始像巨大的浪潮似地涌进集体农庄中来。集体农庄把农民的个人利益和公共利益更好地结合起来，它为无限地发展农业各部门开辟了广阔的远景。
    苏联农民满怀信心地向社会主义前进。苏维埃国家建立了拥有许多拖拉机、收割联合机及其他机器的机器拖拉机站，为集体农庄服务。苏维埃国家还成立了许多国营农业企业——国营农场，它们是农产品的巨大供应者。在苏联实行国家工业化和农业集体化的结果，现在已经创建了规模最大的、机械化程度最高的社会主义农业。目前，苏联总共有九万三千个集体农庄，八千九百八十五个机器拖拉机站，四千八百五十七个国营农场。每个集体农庄土地面积平均为五千九百六十公顷，其中耕地有一千六百九十三公顷，每个国营农场的土地面积平均为一万九千八百公顷，其中耕地有三千一百公顷。
    在苏联，给予集体农庄长期无偿地使用的土地约达五亿八千万公顷。
    一九五三年，在集体农庄和国营农场的田地里耕作的农业机器计有：拖拉机一百二十六万台，收割联合机三十二万六千台，载重汽车三十七万部和其他农业机器九百五十多万部。苏联的农业机械化以空前的速度发展着。仅在一九五四年上半年，农业就得到了九万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），五万二千部载重汽车，一万八千台谷物收割联合机，一万五千台拖拉机牵引的和自动的割草机，以及大量的其他农业机器。
    农业机器的数量正在不断增加。从一九五四年到一九五七年五月，机器拖拉机站和国营农场中将增加五十万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和二十五万台中耕拖拉机。
    这些数字就是苏联重工业所具有的巨大潜力的明证。现在，苏联的重工业每九天的生产量就等于革命前俄国工业的全年产量。
    由于机器设备的增加，农业工作的机械化水平也在提高。和一九四○年相比，一九五三年，集体农庄主要工作的机械化水平增长的情况如下：翻耕秋耕地由百分之七十一提高到百分之一百，秋播由百分之五十三提高到百分之九十三，用收割联合机进行的收割工作由百分之四十三提高到百分之七十七。社会主义农业技术装备的巨大增长为全盘的、即为全部农业工作的完全机械化创造了条件。
    在一九五三年一年内，苏联的农业机器制造厂所生产的各种类型的农业机器和工具有八十多种，其中有在硬性土壤上使用的马铃薯收获联合机，由
  “德特—五十四”式拖拉机牵引的宽幅割草机，青贮饲料收割联合机和推垛机等。
    苏联集体农庄的农业已成为技术、生产力和商品生产率很高的农业。谷物、工业原料作物、蔬菜和饲料作物的播种面积已经大大地扩展了。目前，苏联共播种着一千六百七十三种谷类作物、技术作物、蔬菜、瓜类和饲料作物。这些品种都是由苏联科学家和农业革新家培育出来的。
    集体农庄制度保证了农业一切主要部门生产的逐年增长。例如，在一九四一年到一九五三年间，集体农庄公有牲畜已由五千四百五十万头增加到六千三百万头。猪由二千七百五十万口增加到四千七百六十万口，绵羊和母山羊由九千一百六十万只增加到一亿三千五百九十万只。
    受水灌溉的农业播种面积的显著增加，是集体农庄制度的巨大成就。十月革命前，全国受水灌溉的农田总面积约有四百万公顷，一九五○年就已增加到六百三十万公顷。等到一九五五—一九五六年古比雪夫、斯大林格勒、卡霍夫卡各地的巨大水电站发电后，受水灌溉的土地面积将增加一倍。
    和经济发展同时，集体农庄的公有财产也增加了，农庄庄员们的现金收入和实物收入也随着增加了。一九五三年，集体农庄庄员们的现金收入增加为一九四○年的二点四倍，集体农庄的公积金已增加为二点五倍。这些都说明了集体农庄发展和巩固的情况。和一九四○年相比，按每个从事农业劳动的人计算，一九五三年集体农庄庄员的实际收入平均每人将近增加了一倍。由于发展集体农庄公有经济的新成就，由于共产党和苏联政府为提高集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的物质利益所实行的一切措施，
  一九五四年他们的实际收入就增加得更多了。
    集体农庄生产的伟大力量在于它是在可靠的科学基础上发展的，因为在社会主义社会的条件下，在农业生产中采用科学的一切成就是完全可能的。在解决苏联农业面临的任务方面，不仅运用了生物学和农业科学，而且也运用了化学、物理学、技术和经济学。
    苏联各种专门科学家的共同努力，证明了完全有可能把贫瘠的土地变成不断增产各种农作物的肥沃的良田，证明了完全有可能把动物和植物的生产力无限地提高起来。苏维埃科学密切联系实际，把先进生产者的经验加以总结，并在努力挖掘实现这些潜力的新的途径和方法。
    在集体农庄从事科学研究工作的农学家马尔采夫同志的工作，对进一步发展社会主义农业非常重要。他证明了在一定的条件下不仅多年生作物而且一年生作物也可以提高土壤的肥力。这给农业上的牧草作物轮种制的学说作了重大的修正。他还创造出更有效的耕作方法，为获得高度和稳固的收获量开辟了新的可能性。
    共产党和苏联政府为农业大大增强了物质和资金的保证，制订了保证顺利解决进一步提高社会主义农业的全民任务的其他措施的广泛计划。
    在组织农业的急速提高时，共产党和苏联政府提出一项最重要的全民任务，决定在哈萨克、西伯利亚、伏尔加河流域、乌拉尔等地及北高加索的部分地区开垦一千五百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，以扩大谷物播种面积。这等于美国小麦总播种面积的一半，或者等于加拿大和阿根廷这样一些号称世界谷仓的国家的小麦播种面积的总和。从这一点我们就可以看出苏联一九五四年到一九五五年在东南部和东部地区开垦新地的规模。
    苏联人民在顺利地实现着关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的任务。
    今年八月一日在莫斯科举行的苏联农业展览会，广泛地反映了社会主义农业的发展和成就，表明了共产党在农业社会主义改造的事业中所实行的各项政策的胜利。获得一九五四年苏联农业展览会参加者资格的有：三千一百一十个集体农庄，一千三百零六个国营农场，四百一十九个机器拖拉机站和专门技术站，三千二百五十四个饲畜场，一百九十六个区，五百三十四个科学研究机关和实验机关，一百三十四个学校。有十五万以上的先进生产者和农业组织者是展览会的参加者。这个事实说明了社会主义农业正沿着进步的道路而坚定不移地前进，说明了每个集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站都有着可以发挥的社会主义农业生产的巨大潜力。
    苏联人民理解到自己的力量和在伟大十月革命的岁月中所选择的道路的正确性，他们正坚定不移地、对未来满怀信心地进一步提高农业，为大大改善劳动人民的福利和更加加强社会主义祖国的威力而进行着建设性的工作。（新华社）
