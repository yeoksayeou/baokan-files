The Shanghai Port Authority had exceeded its annual transportation and loading/unloading tasks by 1.23% by November 12th. Currently, all loading and unloading zones are continuing to carry out labor competitions to strive for even greater achievements.

The Shanghai Port Authority improved its quotas in a timely manner, launched labor competitions, and increased the enthusiasm of dockworkers. In January of this year, the average quota per worker per shift for the entire port was only 5.2 tons. After the quota was revised in September (an average increase of 19%), the entire port further launched labor competitions and improved operating techniques. By November, the actual completed quota had increased by 29% compared to January. In just 43 days of the fourth quarter, dockworkers throughout the port improved and created more than 40 new operating methods, increasing work shift efficiency by 11.18% compared to the third quarter. During these 43 days, a total of 132 foreign ships were berthed at Shanghai Port for loading and unloading, of which 116 ships completed their tasks ahead of schedule.

In May of this year, the Shanghai Port Authority conducted safety production education among cadres throughout the bureau, put forward the principle of simultaneous mobilization, inspection, and construction, and, based on relying on the masses of workers, carried out rationalization proposals, enabling cadres and workers to deepen their understanding that production must be safe and safety is for production. All work zones also established a safety duty system. In the fourth quarter, the Port Authority proposed to continue to implement the policy of safe production, organized relevant units to inspect the safety technical measures plan, and decided to equip each work zone with full-time safety personnel to strengthen on-site supervision and inspection. This series of work has improved the safety production situation. For example, the number of work-related injuries in the entire bureau in October decreased by 40.3% compared to April. This played a guarantee role in the early completion of the annual plan.

    上海港务局超额完成全年运输装卸任务
    【本报上海十八日电】上海港务管理局到十一月十二日，已超额百分之一点二三完成全年运输装卸任务。目前各个装卸区正在继续开展劳动竞赛，争取更大的成绩。
    上海港务局适时修改定额，开展劳动竞赛，提高了码头工人的劳动积极性。今年一月份全港每人每工班平均定额仅为五点二吨，经过九月份修改定额（平均提高百分之十九）后，全港进一步开展劳动竞赛，改进操作技术，到了十一月份实际完成的定额已比一月份提高了百分之二十九。仅在第四季度四十三天内，全港码头工人即改进和创造新的操作方法四十多种，使工班效率比第三季度提高了百分之十一点一八。在这四十三天内，停泊在上海港进行装卸的海轮共一百三十二艘次，其中提前完成任务的就有一百十六艘次。
    今年五月间，上海港务局在全局干部中进行了安全生产教育，提出边动员、边检查、边建设的方针，在依靠工人群众的基础上，开展合理化建议，使干部和工人加深了生产必须安全，安全为了生产的认识。各工区并建立了安全值班制度。第四季度港务局提出继续贯彻安全生产的方针，组织有关单位进行了安全技术措施计划的检查，并决定各工区配备专职安全工作人员，加强现场督促和检查。这一系列的工作使安全生产情况有了改善。如十月份全局工伤事故即比四月份减少了百分之四十点三。这对全年计划的提前完成起了保证作用。
