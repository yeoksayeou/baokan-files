    Hebei Province Workers and Cadres Enthusiastically Donate to Flood-stricken People in Disaster Areas
    Factory and mine workers, government cadres, teachers, and urban residents throughout Hebei are actively donating winter clothing and cash to support the people in the flood-stricken areas to restore production and safely get through the winter.
    Workers in factories and mines throughout Hebei Province demonstrated a high degree of mutual aid and friendship in donating winter clothing. Workers at the Huaxin Textile Factory in Tangshan believed that helping farmers in disaster areas through the disaster period was the duty of every worker. In two days, the entire factory donated 2,653 pieces of winter clothing. Female worker Guo Yunxia said, "Farmer brothers supply us with cotton and grain to support factory production; now that they are in difficulty, we must do our best to help them." She alone donated three new wool sweaters. In the factories and mines of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, one could recently hear the words "The disaster of the farmers is our disaster; we must share weal and woe with the farmer brothers in the disaster areas." During working hours, workers brought clothing to donate to disaster victims. Workers in the Ma Wanshui Group of the Longyan Iron Mine donated 27 cotton and wool garments in two days. They also stated: They guarantee to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy in the fourth quarter, and use practical actions to support the compatriots in the disaster areas.
    Government cadres and school teachers also enthusiastically donated their surplus clothing to disaster victims. Cadres from thirty-nine units at the Cangxian Special District level donated more than 4,300 pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks in three days. Cadres in various departments of the Baoding Special District made plans as early as July and August to work hard, economize on expenses, and support disaster victims. Many cadres prepared clothing to donate to disaster victims. As soon as the solicitation of winter clothing began this time, twenty-eight units donated 1,242 pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks. The cadres of the Tangshan Prefectural Grain Bureau not only donated winter clothing, but also wrote letters of condolences to the disaster victims, encouraging them to work hard in production to overcome the famine. Most county teachers held discussions separately, and teachers in Tangxian and Qingyun counties schools have donated 1,214 pieces of various clothing.
    Citizens in Tangshan, Zhangjiakou and other cities have also set off a wave of donations. As of October 21st, residents of the Fourth District of Tangshan City had donated 2,734 pieces of winter clothing. In order to ensure that the victims wear warm and clean clothes, Wu Da Niang and other 46 residents of the Second Street in the district voluntarily organized to dismantle and wash the donated winter clothes. On October 21st alone, they made 43 cotton clothes. Qi Xiuling, a resident of the Second District of Zhangjiakou City, donated her newly made lined clothes to the disaster victims. She said: "The grain we eat is supplied by the farmers. Now that some farmers have suffered natural disasters, we should save money and help them safely through the famine."

    河北工人干部踊跃捐助水灾地区受灾人民
    河北各地厂矿职工、机关干部、教职员和城市居民积极捐献寒衣、现款，支援水灾地区的人民，恢复生产，安全过冬。
    河北省各厂矿的职工在捐献寒衣中，表现了高度的互助友爱精神。唐山市华新纺织工厂的职工，认为帮助灾区农民度过灾期是每个工人的义务。两天的时间，全厂就捐献了两千六百五十三件寒衣。女工郭云霞说：“农民弟兄供给我们棉花和粮食，支援工厂生产；现在他们有困难，我们一定要尽力量帮助他们。”她一个人献出了三件新绒衣。在张家口和宣化两市各厂矿内，近来到处可以听到“农民的灾难就是我们的灾难，我们要和灾区农民弟兄同甘苦，共患难”的话语。上班时，工人们纷纷拿来捐给灾胞的衣服。龙烟铁矿马万水小组的工人，两天的工夫捐献了二十七件棉衣和绒衣。他们还表示：保证完成第四季度的增产节约任务，用实际行动支援灾区同胞。
    机关干部和学校的教职员们也踊跃地把自己多余的衣服捐给灾胞。沧县专区一级三十九个单位的干部，三天内共捐献衣服、鞋袜四千三百多件。保定专区各部门的干部早在七、八月份就作出了努力工作、节约开支、支援灾胞的计划，很多干部都准备了捐给灾胞的衣服。这次一开始募集寒衣，二十八个单位就献出了衣服、鞋袜一千二百四十二件。唐山专署粮食管理局的干部不但捐了寒衣，而且给灾胞写了慰问信，鼓励他们努力生产度荒。大部分县的教职员都分别进行了座谈，唐县和庆云两县学校的教员已捐出了各种衣服一千二百一十四件。
    唐山、张家口等市的市民们也掀起了捐献热潮。唐山市第四区居民到十月二十一日止已捐献了寒衣二千七百三十四件。为了保证灾民穿上暖和整洁的衣服，该区二街居民吴大娘等四十六人自动组织起来拆洗捐献的寒衣，在十月二十一日一天中，她们就做了四十三件棉衣。张家口市第二区居民齐秀玲把自己新做的夹衣捐给灾民。她说：“我们吃的粮食都是农民供给的，现在有些农民受了自然灾害，我们应该省吃俭用，帮助他们安全度过灾荒。”
