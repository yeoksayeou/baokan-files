Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 13th. Employees of the First and Fourth Smelting Plants of the state-owned Shuikoushan Mining Bureau have created a new international record for the quality of fire-refining zinc ingots, reaching "four nines" (meaning a zinc content of 99.99% or more). These "four nines" zinc ingots have been inspected multiple times by the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and many other units, proving that they fully meet the standards for special grade zinc specified by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. The First Smelting Plant is actively preparing to mass-produce "four nines" special grade zinc, and a batch of zinc sand for distilling special grade zinc has already been baked.

"Four nines" zinc is an important raw material for high-grade zinc alloys needed by the defense industry, heavy industry, and medical and chemical instrument industries. In the past, the electrolytic method was generally used to smelt this high-grade zinc. However, the cost of electrolytic zinc smelting is very high, and a large investment is required to build an electrolytic zinc plant, as well as a power plant with a large power generation capacity. The fire smelting method used by the employees of the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau requires simple equipment, uses coal as fuel, and has an overall recovery rate of over 84%, so the cost is lower than that of electrolytic zinc. The success of Shuikoushan Mining Bureau in using fire horizontal retorts to refine high-quality zinc has created valuable experience for fire zinc smelting plants across the country to use existing equipment to mass-produce high-grade zinc ingots.

Before 1951, the zinc ingots produced by the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau contained many impurities such as cadmium and lead, and the products did not sell well. Starting in 1952, they began to find ways to improve quality, but the lead content in the zinc ingots decreased very slowly. Later, after many studies by workers and technicians at the Fourth Smelting Plant, they adopted the chlorination lead removal method of adding salt when roasting zinc sand, and improved the construction of the roasting furnace. Workers such as Sun Guilin also created new operating methods such as "diligent cleaning and quick filing" for the roasting round furnace, which strengthened the oxidation and chlorination during roasting. Finally, in April of last year, they smelted "three nines" (99.9% zinc content) zinc ingots, breaking the conclusion that fire zinc smelting could not reach "three nines". Since the second half of last year, employees of the First and Fourth Smelting Plants of the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau have continued to improve operating tools and methods. When building the roasting furnace, the First Smelting Plant also improved the structure of the furnace, further strengthening the oxidation during roasting. In April of this year, the First and Fourth Smelting Plants finally smelted "four nines" zinc ingots one after another.

### 水口山矿务局冶炼厂职工  创造火力炼锌质量的世界新纪录

    创造火力炼锌质量的世界新纪录
    【新华社长沙十三日电】国营水口山矿务局第一、第四冶炼厂职工创造火力横罐炼锌质量达到“四个九”（即含锌在百分之九九点九九以上）的国际新纪录。这种“四个九”的锌块经过重工业部有色金属工业管理局等许多单位多次检验，证明完全符合重工业部规定的特级锌的标准规格。第一冶炼厂正积极准备大量生产“四个九”的特级锌，一批供蒸馏特级锌用的锌砂，已经烘焙出来。
    “四个九”的锌是国防工业、重工业和医疗、化学仪器工业需要的高级锌合金的重要原料。过去冶炼这种高级锌，一般都要采用电解法。而用电解法炼锌成本很高，建设一个电解锌厂需要很大投资，并且还要配备一个发电量很大的电厂。水口山矿务局职工试验用的火力冶炼方法所需要的设备简单，又是用煤作燃料，总收回率在百分之八十四以上，所以成本比电解锌低廉。水口山矿务局用火力横罐炼制优质锌成功，为我国各地的火力炼锌厂利用原有设备大量生产高级锌块创造了宝贵的经验。
    水口山矿务局在一九五一年以前出产的锌块含镉、铅等杂质很多，产品销路不好。一九五二年起他们开始设法提高质量，但锌块中含铅量降低得很慢。后来第四冶炼厂的工人和技术人员经过多次研究，采用了焙烧锌砂时加食盐的氯化去铅法，并改进了焙烧炉的建筑，工人孙桂林等又创造了焙烧圆炉的“勤清快锉”等新的操作法，加强了焙烧时的氧化和氯化作用，终于在去年四月炼出了“三个九”（含锌百分之九九点九）的锌块，打破了认为火力炼锌不能达到“三个九”的结论。去年下半年以来，水口山矿务局第一、第四冶炼厂职工又继续改进了操作工具和操作方法。第一冶炼厂在建设焙烧炉时，又改进了炉子的结构，进一步加强了焙烧时的氧化作用。今年四月间，第一、第四冶炼厂终于先后炼出了“四个九”的锌块。
