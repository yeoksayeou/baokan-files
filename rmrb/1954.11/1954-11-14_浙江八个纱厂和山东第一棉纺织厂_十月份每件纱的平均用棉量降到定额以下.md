Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th - Since strengthening conservation efforts at the end of September, eight cotton mills in Zhejiang Province reduced their average cotton consumption per yarn piece to 389 catties in October, a decrease of six catties compared to the state's assigned quota. The cotton saved by these factories in one month can be spun into more than a hundred pieces of cotton yarn. The most outstanding achievement was the joint state-private Hangjiang Cotton Mill, where the unit cotton consumption for 21-count yarn in October was reduced by nine catties compared to the quota. Ningbo Wanxin Cotton Mill reduced unit cotton consumption for 6-count yarn by fifteen catties.
	In October, these factories adopted relatively sound technical measures, adding and improving more than ten types of equipment such as airflow plates and collectors to the cotton spinning machinery, greatly reducing flying lint and cotton waste. At the same time, the impurity separators were improved, and more effective fiber was extracted from the cotton waste from the opening and cleaning process. The Chinese Communist Party organizations in each factory played an important role in educating employees about conserving cotton. The CCP Committee of Wanxin Cotton Mill collected examples of waste in the factory and held an exhibition to educate employees. The yarn winding workshop of this factory used to waste more than 1,000 catties of yarn every month. After the case study education, the entire workshop launched mutual criticism. Everyone realized that wasting state property was shameful. From then on, they came up with ways to correct the phenomena of producing too many defective yarns and waste silk. In the past, the maintenance workers of this factory would casually grab a handful of raw cotton to wipe their hands after get off work or cleaning the machine, wasting a lot of cotton. Now that they know that one or two cotton can spin eight hundred meters of yarn, which can weave a pair of socks or a pair of gloves, they have consciously eliminated this wasteful behavior.
	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th - The state-owned Shandong No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which failed to complete its cotton consumption plan in the first six months of this year, has gradually reduced its unit cotton consumption below the quota since entering the third quarter due to strengthened conservation efforts. In October, the average cotton consumption per yarn piece was reduced to 385.53 catties. Comparing the actual cotton consumption with the quota, the factory saved the state 32,507 catties of raw cotton in the third quarter alone.
	Since July, the factory has established a series of raw cotton management systems, incorporating the consumption quotas for each process into the work plan. It also focused on strengthening the work of the opening and cleaning workshop and improved the opening and cleaning machines. Some workers had originally thought that "we cannot save raw cotton if we want to improve quality." This misconception has also gradually changed. In October, the quality of both yarn and cloth reached the planned targets.

### 浙江八个纱厂和山东第一棉纺织厂  十月份每件纱的平均用棉量降到定额以下

    浙江八个纱厂和山东第一棉纺织厂
    十月份每件纱的平均用棉量降到定额以下
    【新华社杭州十三日电】浙江省八个纱厂从九月底加强节约工作以来，十月份每件纱的平均用棉量已降低到三百八十九斤，比国家代纺定额标准减少六斤。这些厂一个月中节约下来的棉花可以纺成一百多件棉纱。成绩最突出的公私合营杭江纱厂，十月份二十一支纱的单位用棉量比定额标准减少了九斤，宁波万信纱厂六支纱的单位用棉量减少了十五斤。
    这些厂在十月份都采取了比较健全的技术措施，在棉纺机械上增添和改进了气流板、集合器等十多种设备，大大减少了飞花和漏花，同时改进了杂质分离器，从清花落棉中提取的有效纤维也增多了。各个厂的中共党组织在教育职工节约用棉方面起了重要的作用，中共万信纱厂党委会曾搜集本厂中浪费的实例举行展览会，向职工进行教育。这个厂摇纱车间原来每个月要浪费一千多斤纱，经过实例教育后，全车间开展了互相批评，人人都认识到浪费国家财富是可耻的，从此都想出办法，纠正了坏纱多、回丝多的现象。这个厂的保全工人以往每逢下班或揩完车后就随手拿一把白花擦手，浪费了许多棉花。现在知道了一两棉花能纺八百公尺长的纱，可织一双袜子或一副手套后，就都自觉地消灭了这种浪费行为。
    【新华社济南十三日电】今年头六个月中都没有完成用棉计划的国营山东第一棉纺织厂，进入第三季度以后，因为加强了节约工作，单位用棉量已逐渐降低到定额以下，十月份每件纱的用棉量平均又降低到三百八十五点五三斤。拿实际用棉量和定额比较，仅第三季度就给国家节约了三万二千五百零七斤原棉。
    这个厂从七月份开始建立了一系列的原棉管理制度，把各工序的消耗定额都编制到作业计划中去；还着重加强了清花车间的工作，改进了清花机。有一部分工人原来认为“要提高质量就不能节约原棉”的错误看法，也逐渐改变了。十月份，纱和布的质量都达到了计划指标。
