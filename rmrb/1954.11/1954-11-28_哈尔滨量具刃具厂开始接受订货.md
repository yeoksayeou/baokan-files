    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Begins Accepting Orders
    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant has successfully trial-produced nearly fifty types of drill bits, taps, dies, reamers, and milling cutters. These successfully trial-produced cutting tools are now being produced in small batches and supplied to machine manufacturing factories in China. Two batches of products have already been sent to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, including small drill bits as thin as matchsticks, which China could not manufacture in the past. Currently, more than 120 factories and enterprises across the country have placed orders with this newly built measuring & cutting tool plant.
    More and more workshops in this plant are now being put into production. Tested and inspected steel is being continuously sent from the metal material warehouse to various workshops. 1.4 mm drill bits and the relatively difficult-to-make 3 mm hand reamers have also been put into production for trial manufacturing.

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂开始接受订货
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂已试制成功了将近五十种规格的钻头丝锥、板牙、铰刀和铣刀。这些试制成功的刃具已经小批生产，开始供应我国机器制造厂使用。给第一汽车制造厂的产品已送出了两批，其中包括我国过去还不能制造的相当火柴杆那么粗的小钻头。目前，全国已有一百二十多个工厂企业向这个新建的量具刃具厂订货。
    这个厂现在有愈来愈多的工部投入了生产。经过化验和检查的钢材，正由金属材料仓库源源地送到各个车间。一点四公厘的钻头和较难做的三公厘的手铰刀，都已投料开始试制了。　（新华社）
