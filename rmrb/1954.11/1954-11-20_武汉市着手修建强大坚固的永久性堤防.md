    Based on the flood control experience this year, Wuhan is planning to build more powerful and solid permanent dike projects, which have recently begun construction. On the Zhanggong Dike in the northern suburbs of Hankou and the Wuqing Dike (Wuchang-Qingshan, along the river northeast of Wuchang), as well as along the Yangtze River and Xiang River (Han River) dikes in Hanyang, a team of more than 20,000 people is cleaning up the original dikes. Hydraulic engineering personnel are working intensively on the design and construction preparations for the various near-term projects to be built this winter and spring. When the water level at Wuhan Customs drops below twenty meters, the various near-term projects can be officially started.
    The goal of Wuhan's dike construction is: the main dikes along the Yangtze River, Xiang River (Han River), and Houhu Lake in the three towns will be gradually raised and thickened on the original basis, so that the elevation of the dike body will reach more than thirty meters; repairing and constructing revetments, waterproof walls, and slope protection projects along the river; Under the Hanyang Yangtze River and Han River dikes, as well as the Wuqing Dike in Wuchang and the Da and Xiao Zhanggong Dikes in Hankou, some roads suitable for national economic construction and dike construction will be built. Wave-proof forests will be widely planted around the dikes, and Qingshan Sluice will be newly built in the dike section, and several large and small culverts and gate equipment will be rebuilt and strengthened. The entire plan must be completed in the next few years. After these projects are completed, Wuhan's dike construction will become an impregnable fortress, ensuring the safety of national construction and the people in the Wuhan area during floods.

    武汉市着手修建强大坚固的永久性堤防
    根据今年防汛经验，武汉市计划修建的更强大和坚固的永久性堤防工程，已在最近着手施工。在汉口北郊张公堤和武（昌）青（青山，在武昌东北沿江）堤上，以及在汉阳沿江、沿河（襄河，即汉水）堤线上，一支由两万多人组成的队伍，正进行着原有堤防的清理工作。水利工程人员在紧张地进行今冬明春所要修筑的各项近期工程的设计和施工准备工作。待武汉关水位降落到二十公尺以下时，各项近期工程就可正式开工。
    武汉市的堤防建设目标是：三镇沿长江、襄河
  （汉水）、后湖的干堤都将在原有基础上逐步加高培厚，使堤身标高都达到三十公尺以上；修整和新建沿江、沿河的驳岸、防水墙和护坡工程；在汉阳沿江、沿河堤防脚下以及武昌的武青堤和汉口的大、小张公堤堤腰，将修建一些适合国家经济建设和堤防建设需用的公路，堤防外围将广植防浪林，堤段中并将新建青山闸、改建和加固若干大、小涵闸和闸口设备。全部计划须今后若干年内才能完成，这些工程完成后，将使武汉的堤防建设成为铜墙铁壁，在洪水期间确保武汉地区国家建设和人民的安全。（新华社）
