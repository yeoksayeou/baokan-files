It is expected that oil tea will have a bumper harvest in the mountainous areas of Jiangxi and Fujian provinces.
Hunan Province farmers expand rapeseed planting area according to national plan.
    The oil tea seed harvesting work of over one million mu of oil tea forests in mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province has basically been completed this year. Some farmers who plant oil tea trees say that this year is the best harvest in many years. The oil tea seed harvest in Shangrao County can reach more than 600,000 jin, more than double the amount of last year. The average oil tea seed production in Yushan County increased by 45% to 50% compared with last year. In Shangkeng, Dakeng, Bankeng, Chetain, and Shatain townships of Suichuan County, oil tea seed production increased by more than 30% compared with last year. According to estimates by the Forestry Department of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, the province's tea oil production this year can reach more than 140,000 dan, equivalent to 1.9 times that of 1950.

    About 200,000 mu of oil tea forests in the mountainous areas of Fujian Province are laden with fruit, and farmers are going up the mountains to harvest them. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have prepared for the purchase and processing of oil tea seeds. It is estimated that the oil tea seeds produced throughout the province this year can produce four million jin of tea oil. The tea oil production in the main producing area of ​​Fuan Special Zone this year can increase by more than 20% compared with last year (about 1.43 million jin).
    In order to further increase tea oil production, the Fujian Provincial People's Government has planned to reclaim and construct 93,000 mu of oil tea forest this winter and next spring. Now, while harvesting oil tea seeds, farmers in various places are selecting good seeds, reclaiming mountain land, and actively cultivating and constructing oil tea forests. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The rapeseed sowing work in Hunan Province is nearing completion of the planned tasks.
    This year, farmers in various parts of Hunan responded to the call of the state with great enthusiasm and expanded the area of ​​rapeseed planting according to the plan. Due to the active sowing by the vast number of farmers, many areas have overfulfilled or nearly completed their planned tasks. For example, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region originally planned to sow 250,000 mu of rapeseed, but has now completed more than 319,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by more than 69,000 mu; the Qianyang Special Zone has sown more than 450,000 mu, approaching the completion of the planned target; the sowing area of ​​Shaoyang Special Zone has reached 84% of the original plan; and the Changde Special Zone has also planted more than 680,000 mu, and is still seizing the time to rush planting in places where it can be planted. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of rapeseed, mutual aid and cooperative organizations have been used as the center to carry out seedling protection and cultivation work. In Huagu Township, Dongkou County, more than 80 people were dispatched in one day to water shade more than 90 mu of rapeseed. Some areas have also stepped up pest control work. Piaoqu Township in Xining First District used "666" pesticide powder to control pests, which timely eliminated the pests and the rapeseed seedlings grew well. (Xu Zhengzhai)

    江西福建两省山区油茶可望丰收
    湖南省农民按照国家计划扩大油菜种植面积
    江西省各山区今年一百多万亩油茶林的油茶籽采收工作已基本完毕。有些地方种植油茶树的农民说：今年是许多年来没有过的好收成。上饶县油茶籽收获量可达六十多万斤，比去年增产一倍以上。玉山县油茶籽平均比去年增产百分之四十五到五十。遂川县上坑、大坑、板坑、车田、沙田等五个乡，油茶籽比去年增产百分之三十以上。据江西省人民政府林业厅估计，今年全省茶油产量可达十四万多担，相当于一九五零年的一点九倍。

    福建省山区约二十万亩油茶林结实累累，农民们正上山采收。各地供销合作社都做好了收购和加工油茶籽的准备工作。据估计：今年全省所产油茶籽，能榨茶油四百万斤。主要产地福安专区今年茶油产量，可比去年（一百四十三万斤左右）增加二成以上。
    为了进一步增产茶油，福建省人民政府已计划在今冬明春垦复和营造油茶林九万三千亩。现在各地农民一面采收油茶籽，一面选留良种，垦辟山地，积极抚育和营造油茶林。　（新华社）
    湖南省油菜播种工作已接近完成计划任务。
    湖南各地农民今年都用极大的热情响应国家号召，按计划扩大了油菜种植面积。由于广大农民积极播种，很多地区已经超额或接近完成了计划任务。如湘西苗族自治区原计划播种油菜二十五万亩，现已完成了三十一万九千多亩，超过原计划六万九千多亩；黔阳专区已播种四十五万多亩，接近完成计划指标；邵阳专区播种面积已达原计划的百分之八十四；常德专区也种了六十八万多亩，能种的地方仍正抓紧抢种。各地为了争取油菜丰收，以互助合作组织为中心，开展了保苗育苗工作。洞口县花古乡一天中出动了八十多人，担水荫油菜九十多亩。有的地区还抓紧进行除虫工作，新宁一区漂曲乡用
  “六六六”药粉除虫，及时消灭了虫害，油菜幼苗生长良好。　　（徐正斋）
