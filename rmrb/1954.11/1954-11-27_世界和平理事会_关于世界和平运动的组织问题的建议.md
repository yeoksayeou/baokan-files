Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, November 25th (TASS dispatch):

    The World Peace Council notes the significant contribution of the peace movement to the recent victories of people in all countries in safeguarding peace.
    The ideas and actions of the world peace movement have produced a far-reaching impact. These ideas and actions have become the basis for the widespread public opinion worldwide demanding peaceful resolution of international disputes. The movement has gained new strength and increasing support, resulting in a significant increase in its influence and prestige.
    At the same time, the importance of the achievements already made and the arduousness of the tasks placed upon us by the international situation place a responsibility on the entire movement to continuously improve its work and working methods.
    In many countries, national movements have proven their ability to initiate actions that can attract people from all walks of life and unite peace forces as widely as possible. As a result, they have established prestige and influence, and because they conform to the desire of the people of each country for peace, their prestige and influence are reflected in the attitudes and opinions of important political and public forces and individuals representing broad sections of public opinion in these countries.
    Although the movement as a whole has strengthened, it should not be overlooked that some organizational problems still exist, such as:
    The movement does not always develop its organization according to the extent of its influence in terms of its ideas and work.
    In some countries, the international actions are not adapted to the specific conditions of these countries, with the result that only abstract goals are put forward, weakening the work.
    Another situation is that, in order to expand the peace front, the movement has abandoned its program of action or simply seeks the support of certain well-known figures or groups, affecting the necessary work among the ordinary people.
    The national committees of certain countries, in terms of their organizational principles, working methods, and arguments, are similar to political organizations, putting forward slogans that are too narrow to attract the attention of people from different social backgrounds or with different political and philosophical beliefs.
    To solve these organizational problems, it is necessary to find ways to implement the resolutions adopted by the World Peace Council at its previous meetings and congresses, and to abide by the principles established by the movement in its five years of working experience.
    The peace movement is a movement that can achieve the broadest unity of peace forces or promote such unity.
    It constantly strives, without distinction or restriction, whether international or domestic, to unite all those who recognize the principle of peaceful coexistence and the settlement of international disputes through consultation. It determines mutually acceptable goals and courses of action through free discussion.
    The peace movement does not seek to monopolize the struggle for peace. It calls on all people and organizations representing peace forces to cooperate with it to ensure the success of the activities it advocates. The broad goals of the peace movement and its ability to launch activities that gain support in every country make it a center of attraction, attracting all those who are willing to contribute to maintaining peace. Therefore, its survival and consolidation are necessary conditions for the development of activities and unity of peace forces. However, the peace movement also declares its readiness to support various actions initiated by whomever, as long as such actions can unite everyone to work together to ease the international situation.
    The peace movement is characterized by taking action. The existence and strength of the peace movement in each country depends on its constantly renewed work, and on uniting all people of goodwill to strive to achieve correct and practical goals that stem from the demands of the international situation and the interests of the nation.
    The movement relies on peace committees organized in the places where people live and work to carry out activities. These committees constantly appeal to public opinion of various tendencies, thus ensuring the broadest unity and maximizing the effectiveness of the actions they take.
    The World Peace Council recommends that the national peace committees use the following suggestions as a guide:
    On various occasions, either in the name of the national committees or through statements by its most prominent activists, state the peace movement's attitude towards various domestic and international events related to easing international tensions. This will demonstrate the independent nature of the peace movement. In this regard, constant attention should also be paid to constantly condemning all actions that create obstacles in the way of easing international tensions, such as: clamoring for war against a certain country, establishing military blocs, refusing consultation, or taking discriminatory actions against the development of economic and cultural relations between countries.
    Use the rich experience of taking joint actions in cooperation with various prominent figures and organizations to strengthen and expand this cooperation, not only with individual figures or representatives of individual organizations, but also with the classes they represent. To achieve this goal, initiate and support actions that can be jointly carried out on a national and international scale.
    Maintain the democratic and broad nature of the movement; establish and rebuild committees so that they can more broadly represent the opinions of all classes to jointly decide on the goals and forms of action; all members of the committees are responsible for formulating and implementing resolutions, and electing committees responsible for convening congresses and representative conferences.
    Seek the best way to develop the regular activities of regional and local peace committees, while not neglecting the links between various tasks: collecting signatures, organizing national referendums, issuing petitions, and even organizing movements to send petition groups; convening meetings in various regions and factories to prepare for larger-scale conferences; holding local and regional gatherings to prepare for national conferences and action days, action weeks, and action months, etc.
    Experience has shown that each committee must constantly pay attention to seeking the working methods that can best promote joint action in each country, and must find and list some arguments and facts to make the goals of the struggle for peace put forward by the World Peace Council more specific, and to closely link these goals with the interests of the residents.
    In addition to political activities, each committee has a constant task, which is to raise the financial resources necessary for the development of work. Due to the nature of this movement, it cannot collect membership fees from the participants of the peace movement.
    Close contact must be maintained with the Secretariat of the World Peace Council and with other national movement organizations in various countries to ensure better cooperation and coordination of their activities worldwide. This contact can be achieved through the following methods: sending representatives to attend meetings of the World Peace Council, disseminating information materials by the Secretariat of the World Peace Council, mutually sending delegations to visit, and exchanging publications, films, and documents. The Secretariat of the World Peace Council, as a permanent body, can assist in promoting this necessary cooperation.
    On this basis, strengthening the peace movement organizationally and solving possible organizational problems is a necessary condition for better developing work, and an effective contribution to the broadest unity of peace forces.

### 世界和平理事会  关于世界和平运动的组织问题的建议

    世界和平理事会
    关于世界和平运动的组织问题的建议
    世界和平理事会注意到，在各国人民最近所取得的维护和平的胜利中，和平运动作出了很大的贡献。
    世界和平运动的思想和行动产生了深远的影响。这些思想和行动成为全世界要求和平解决国际争端的广大舆论的基础。运动得到新的力量的越来越大的支持，结果使得运动的影响和威信大大地提高。
    同时，已取得的成果的重要性以及国际局势所加于我们身上的任务的繁重，使得整个运动有责任不断地改进自己的工作和工作方式。
    在许多国家中，全国性的运动已经证明：它们有能力发起能够吸引各界人民参加的行动，并且把和平力量尽量广泛地团结起来。因此，它们确立了威信和影响，而且由于它们符合各国人民要求和平的愿望，它们的威信和影响从代表这些国家广泛阶层的公众舆论的重要的政治和公众力量以及个人的态度和意见中可以反映出来。
    运动整个说来虽然已经加强，但是不应该不看到，现在还存在着一些组织上的问题，如：
    运动并不是经常根据它的思想和工作拥有多大的影响，来发展自己的组织。
    在一些国家中，没有使国际上采取的行动适应这些国家本国的具体情况，结果就只能是提出一些抽象的目标，削弱了工作。
    另一种情况是，为了扩大和平阵线，运动放弃了自己的行动纲领，或者只是去寻求某些知名人物或团体的支持，而影响了在普通人民中进行必要的工作。
    某些国家的全国性委员会按其组织原则、工作方式和提出论据来说，都近似于政治组织，它们提出过于狭隘的口号，不能引起不同的社会出身或抱有不同的政治和哲学信仰的各阶层人民的注意。
    要解决这些组织问题，就必须设法实现世界和平理事会历届会议和大会所通过的决议，并且遵守运动在五年工作经验当中所确定下来的原则。
    和平运动是能够使和平力量获得最广泛的团结或是促进这种团结的一种运动。
    它经常努力，不加区别和限制，不分国际国内，使一切承认和平共处和用协商方式解决国际争端这条原则的人们团结起来。它通过自由讨论来确定大家都能接受的目的和行动方式。
    和平运动不是要垄断争取和平的斗争。它是号召代表和平力量的所有人士和所有组织来同它合作，以保证它所倡导的活动获得成功。和平运动的目标广泛，而且有能力发动在每一个国家中都获得支持的活动，这就使它成为一个引力中心，吸引着一切愿意出力维护和平的人们。因此，它的生存和巩固是和平力量开展活动和团结一致的必要条件。但是，和平运动同时宣布准备支持不论由谁发起的各种行动，只要这种行动能够团结大家共同致力于缓和国际局势。
    和平运动是以采取行动为它的特色的。每个国家中和平运动的存在和力量取决于它的经常革新的工作，取决于团结所有善良的人们去争取实现那些从国际局势要求出发和民族利益出发的正确和实际的目标。
    运动依靠在人们居住的地点和工作的地点组织起来的和平委员会展开活动。这些委员会不断地向各种倾向的舆论发出号召，因而保证了最广泛的团结，并且使它们所采取的行动收到最大的效果。
    世界和平理事会建议各国和平委员会以下列建议作为方针：
    在各种场合下，或者以各国委员会的名义，或者通过它的最著名的活动家的声明，表明和平运动对同缓和国际紧张局势有关的各种国内和国际事件的态度。这就可以表明和平运动的独立性质。在这方面，还应当时时注意，经常谴责一切在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上造成障碍的行动，例如：叫嚣对某个国家发动战争，建立军事集团，拒绝协商，或对发展各国间经济和文化关系采取歧视行动等。
    利用同各种著名人士和组织合作采取联合行动的丰富经验，来加强和扩大这种合作，不仅要同个别人物或个别组织的代表合作，还要同他们所代表的那些阶层合作。要达到这个目的，就要发起和支持那种可以在全国范围内和国际范围内共同展开的行动。
    维护这个运动的民主性质和广泛性质；建立和重建委员会，使它们可以更加广泛地代表各阶层的意见，以共同来决定行动的目标和形式；委员会的全体委员负责拟定和执行决议，选举负责召开大会和代表大会的委员会。
    寻求一种最好的方式来展开各地区和地方的和平委员会的经常性活动，同时不要忽略各种工作之间的联系：征集签名，组织全民投票，发出请愿书，以至组织派遣请愿团的运动；在各地区和工厂召集会议来筹备规模更大的会议；举行地方和地区的集会来筹备全国会议和行动日、行动周和行动月等。
    经验表明，每个委员会必须经常注意在每个国家中寻求最能促成共同行动的工作方式，必须寻找和列举一些论据和事实使世界和平理事会提出的为和平而斗争的目标更加具体化，并且要使这些目标同居民的利益密切联系起来。
    各委员会除了政治活动外，还有一个经常的任务，就是筹集发展工作所必须的财力，由于这个运动的性质，使它不能向和平运动的参加者收集会费。
    必须同世界和平理事会书记处以及同各国其他全国性运动组织保持紧密联系，以使它们的活动在世界范围内有更好的合作和配合。这种联系可以通过下列办法实现：派代表出席世界和平理事会会议，由世界和平理事会书记处散发消息材料，相互派遣代表团访问，交换出版物、影片和文件。世界和平理事会书记处作为一个常设机构可以协助促进这种必要的合作。
    在这样的基础上，从组织上加强和平运动和解决可能发生的组织问题，便是更好地展开工作的必要条件，便是对最广泛地团结和平力量的一个有效贡献。
