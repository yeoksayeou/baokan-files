    Pay Attention to Doing a Good Job in Material Inventory
    Wang Chongren of the Northwest Regional Company of the China Traffic Electrical Equipment Company writes: Recently, the state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory requested our company to accept their stockpiled materials. From the inventory list provided, it can be seen that the quantity of their stockpiled materials is very large. Of particular note is that among the stockpiled materials are over 9,700 kilograms of bare copper stranded wire, enough to erect a twelve-kilometer-long line. This copper wire is an important material under the unified control of the central government, and our company has been short of this kind of goods from the autumn of 1952 until now, unable to supply the needs of various industrial and mining enterprises. However, such a large amount of copper wire has been stockpiled in the Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory for more than two years.
    The situation of stockpiled bare copper stranded wire illustrates a problem: In order to prevent useful materials in national industry from being stockpiled, all enterprises and departments should regularly pay attention to material inventory work and promptly report unused materials to higher authorities for handling and dispatch.

专栏：来信摘要

    注意做好物资清理工作
    中国交通电工器材公司西北区公司王崇仁来信：最近国营西北第二棉纺织厂要求我公司接收他们的积压物资。从交来的清册中可以看出，他们积压物资的数量是很大的。特别值得注意的是，积压物资中有裸铜绞线共九千七百多公斤，能架设一条十二公里长的线路。这种紫铜线是中央统一掌握的重要物资，我公司从一九五二年秋季到现在就一直缺少这样的货，不能供应各地工矿企业的需要。但是，这样大量的紫铜线却在西北第二棉纺织厂里积压了两年多。
    裸铜绞线积压的情况说明了一个问题：为使国家工业上的有用物资不致积压，各企业部门应该经常注意物资清理工作，及时把不用的物资，报请上级处理调度。
