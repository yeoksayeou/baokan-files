    Guangxi Province's Lingui and Four Other Counties
    Promote "Pig and Cattle Care at the Trough" Work

    Between the summer and autumn of this year, Lingui, Xing'an, Quanxian, Yangshuo, and Yongfu counties in Guangxi Province successively promoted "pig and cattle care at the trough" work in more than forty townships, achieving preliminary results. To do this work well, Xing'an and four other counties organized forty-five veterinarians to establish thirteen veterinary clinics. After farmers sign contracts with the veterinary clinics, they only pay a certain trough insurance fee to the veterinary clinic. In addition to providing free treatment for the sick pigs and cattle of these farmers, the veterinary clinics also regularly guide farmers in the techniques of raising and managing pigs and cattle, and conduct regular health check-ups and immunization injections for pigs and cattle, effectively preventing and reducing diseases and deaths of pigs and cattle, and reducing farmers' livestock disease medical expenses. Therefore, the "pig and cattle care at the trough" work is welcomed by the majority of farmers. To date, nearly 30,000 pigs and cattle in these forty-plus townships have participated in trough insurance. The veterinary clinics have treated more than 2,200 pig and cattle diseases, with a cure rate of over 91 percent. (Li Furong)

    广西省临桂等五县
    推行“猪牛看槽保健”工作
    今年夏秋间，广西省临桂、兴安、全县、阳朔、永福等五县，先后在四十多个乡里推行“猪牛看槽保健”工作，获得初步成绩。为了做好这个工作，兴安等五县组织四十五名兽医，成立了十三个兽医诊所。农民与兽医诊所订立合同后，农民只向兽医诊所交纳一定的槽保费，兽医诊所除免费治疗这些农民的有病猪牛外，还经常指导农民饲养管理猪牛的技术，并定期进行猪牛健康检查和防疫注射，有效地防治和减少猪牛的疾病和死亡，并减轻了农民牲畜疾病医药费，因此，“猪牛看槽保健”工作受到广大农民的欢迎。到目前为止，这四十多个乡已有近三万头猪牛参加槽保。兽医诊所共治疗了二千二百多只猪牛的疾病，治愈率达百分之九十一以上。　（李福荣）
