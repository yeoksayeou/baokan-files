In the Han Chinese areas of Xikang Province, work is gradually being carried out to expand the rapeseed planting area. The Ya'an and Xichang special districts have formulated plans for developing oil crops based on the province's requirement to expand the rapeseed planting area by 30,000 mu, increasing rapeseed production by more than 22,000 dan. In early October, each county in Ya'an Special District successively convened enlarged cadre meetings to specifically study the work of mobilizing farmers to actively expand the rapeseed planting area and complete the oil crop production increase plan. People's representatives meetings in Ya'an, Hanyuan and other counties also specifically adopted resolutions to mobilize farmers throughout the county to make full use of winter fallow land to plant more rapeseed in order to achieve self-sufficiency in cooking oil next year. Tianquan County also called on every farmer in the county to use the edges of fields, ditch edges, and crevices for planting, striving to be self-sufficient in some cooking oil next year. Counties in Xichang Special District have also actively carried out work to expand the production of oil crops. Mianning County has drafted specific measures to mobilize farmers throughout the county to make rational use of the original spring fields and winter fallow fields to plant rapeseed, wheat, and barley crops, to ensure the completion of the plan to expand the rapeseed planting area by 6,500 mu.

Currently, this work of increasing oil crop production is gradually deepening. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives in various regions have formulated specific plans to expand the rapeseed planting area. According to statistics from fourteen agricultural producers' cooperatives in Ya'an, Yingjing, Hanyuan, Huidong, and Mianning counties, a total of 475 mu of rapeseed planting area is planned to be expanded this year. The Nongzheng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Hanyuan County only planted 0.7 mu of rapeseed last year, but this year it has expanded to 27 mu; the Heying Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xichang County did not have the habit of planting rapeseed before, but this year it plans to try planting 168 mu. In addition to taking the lead in expanding the rapeseed planting area, many mutual aid teams in various regions also publicize the significance of planting more rapeseed to the surrounding masses, which greatly encourages the masses' enthusiasm for increasing rapeseed production. According to incomplete statistics from Dahe Township in Tianquan County, Taiping Village in Shizhi Township in Yingjing County, and the first district of Huidong County, a total of 1,600 mu of rapeseed planting area has been expanded this year due to the promotion of mutual aid organizations.

    西康省汉人地区普遍扩大油菜种植面积
    西康省汉人地区逐步展开扩大油菜种植面积的工作。雅安、西昌两专区已分别根据全省扩大油菜种植面积三万亩，共增产油菜籽二万二千余担的要求，订出了发展油料作物的计划。十月上旬，雅安专区各县先后召开了扩大干部会议，具体研究了动员农民积极扩大油菜种植面积，完成油料作物增产计划的工作；雅安、汉源等县人民代表大会会议，还专门作出了动员全县农民尽量利用冬闲田地多种油菜，争取明年食油自给的决议。天全县并号召全县每户农民利用田边地角、沟沿隙地种植，争取明年自给一部食油。西昌专区各县也积极进行了扩大油料作物生产的工作。冕宁县已拟出了具体办法，动员全县农民把原小春田地及冬闲田地分别合理利用，种植油菜和小麦、大麦作物，以保证完成扩大油菜种植面积六千五百亩的计划。
    目前，这一增产油料作物的工作，正逐步深入进行。各地许多农业生产合作社，都订出了扩大油菜种植面积的具体计划。据雅安、荥经、汉源、会东、冕宁五个县十四个农业生产合作社的统计，今年总共计划扩大油菜种植面积四百七十五亩。汉源县农政农业生产合作社，去年只种了七分田的油菜，今年扩大为二十七亩；西昌县合营村农业生产合作社原来没有种油菜的习惯，今年也计划试种一百六十八亩。各地许多互助组除带头扩大油菜种植面积外，还向周围群众宣传多种油菜的意义，因而大大鼓舞了群众增产油菜的积极性。据天全县大河乡、荥经县石滓乡太平村、会东县第一区不完全统计，由于互助组织的带动，今年总共扩大了一千六百亩油菜种植面积。
