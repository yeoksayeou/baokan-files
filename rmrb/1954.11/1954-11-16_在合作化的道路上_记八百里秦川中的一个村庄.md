On the Road to Cooperativization
— A Village in the Eight Hundred Li Qin Chuan
By Our Correspondent Ai Fang

In mid-September, I visited the Liangsi Du Village in Xianyang County, Shaanxi. At this time, the villagers were busy preparing for the autumn harvest and planting, as well as expanding and establishing agricultural production cooperatives.

This is a village of about three hundred households, located on the bank of the Wei River, and is a ferry crossing. There used to be two small temples on the east and west sides of the village, hence the name Liangsi Du (Two Temples Ferry).

The land here is very fertile, a piece of land on the famous and rich Eight Hundred Li Qin Chuan, with crisscrossing canals and abundant production of wheat and cotton. This year's wheat harvest here was unprecedented. In autumn, corn and millet are already ripe and waiting to be harvested; the cotton fields are covered in white flowers, and men and women are picking flowers in the fields from morning till night—everywhere is a scene of harvest again.

The rich and beautiful farmers of Liangsi Du lived extremely poor and harsh lives before liberation (everyone called Liangsi Du “Helao Village” because many people in the village made a living selling Helao noodles). After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, everyone organized and gradually moved towards prosperity.

Here, the Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoguang Cooperative) and its members are at the forefront. Although the Xiaoguang Cooperative previously had only eleven members, it pointed the way for everyone like a flag; everyone, young and old, knew about it. The Xiaoguang Cooperative's crop yield is the highest in the area. Weibin Township (which administers Liangsi Du) is Xianyang County's high-yield township this year, with an average wheat yield of 320 jin per mu, which is no small number. However, the Xiaoguang Cooperative's land averaged more than 370 jin per mu. Although the autumn crops have not yet been harvested and the yield cannot be finally determined, those experienced farmers already have a number in their minds: individual households and mutual aid teams can harvest an average of 300 jin to more than 400 jin of corn per mu, while the Xiaoguang Cooperative can reach an average of 600 jin per mu; individual households and mutual aid teams can harvest an average of more than 60 jin to nearly 70 jin of cotton per mu (seed cotton, the same below), while the Xiaoguang Cooperative can harvest an average of more than 70 jin to nearly 80 jin per mu. Everyone says, "The crops in the cooperative are shiny and oily." The Xiaoguang Cooperative has the strongest vehicles and livestock, and raises the most and fattest pigs. There is a saying here to describe well-to-do middle peasants: "Four Hard Households" — hard land, hard livestock, hard farm tools, and hard labor. But the land, livestock, farm tools, and labor of any "Four Hard Household" or any mutual aid team cannot compare to the hardness of the cooperative.

One day, after dinner, cooperative member Feng Zengwu talked to me at his home about his life for the past half century. According to Feng Zengwu, his family of four, which originally farmed 7.2 mu of land, was bound by three things before liberation (actually more than three, but the three that directly hit him the hardest). First, the Kuomintang conscripted him twice. He didn't go, so he paid money and found someone to take his place, which cost the equivalent of 1,800 jin of wheat twice; second, his father died and he had to pay for the funeral; third, his house was destroyed and he built a small one. From then on, he was burdened with high-interest debts. He said:
"Plus, the land was small, I couldn't afford livestock, so I couldn't accumulate manure, the crops didn't grow well, and the grain I harvested each year was eaten up paying interest. If I paid the interest, there was nothing to eat! I tried all sorts of ways, working long hours for others, selling short-term labor... but it still didn't work..." As he spoke, he waved his hand, as if to indicate that the past was over and there was no need to mention it again.

After liberation, Feng Zengwu was freed from the shackles of usury. He joined a mutual aid team. Although their mutual aid team didn't do very well until he joined the cooperative, their lives were still gradually improving. He said:
"If the family's income could be the same as this year's, things would have been even better a long time ago!" His words were based on facts. This year, during the preliminary wheat harvest distribution of the Xiaoguang Cooperative, he received 1,755 jin of wheat, plus sideline dividends, totaling 440,000 yuan. The wheat income alone was 1,375 jin more than last year when he was in the mutual aid team. This is only part of his total annual income. Now, the estimate of the total annual income of the Xiaoguang Cooperative has been calculated. He and his wife have already worked more than 150 workdays, and it is estimated that they can work 180 workdays throughout the year. Each workday can be divided into about 17,000 yuan. In this way, his labor dividend for the whole year can be about 3 million yuan, plus the land dividend, the whole family can earn about 4 million yuan throughout the year. Converting this money into wheat is nearly 4,000 jin. This is the most Feng Zengwu has ever earned in a year.

It's not just that they got more grain. The cooperative members have a deep understanding of the benefits of unified land management, preliminary division of labor, and collective work. All the cooperative members who used to have livestock say: Farming was difficult in the past! During busy times, people and livestock would go to the fields together and return home together. When the livestock rested, people couldn't rest—they had to push two carts of dirt to cushion the livestock pens, fetch water if there was no water, and get up again and again at night to mix grass and feed the livestock, and couldn't get a good night's sleep. Now, there are dedicated people to feed the livestock, dedicated people to engage in sideline occupations, and everyone is assigned agricultural work. Everyone works with one heart, calmly, happily, and efficiently, and doesn't feel tired. Cooperative members who didn't have livestock in the past say: Farming was difficult in the past! Everything had to be taken care of, seeds, fertilizers... even if we formed a mutual aid team, the problems of livestock and farm tools were solved, but there were still many other problems. After joining the cooperative, the problems that couldn't be solved in the past were all solved.

These facts are really exciting. This spring, when the wheat seedlings of the Xiaoguang Cooperative grew up and it was confirmed that "the wheat in the cooperative is really better," some people went to the Xiaoguang Cooperative and asked to join. Because it was not the time for the Xiaoguang Cooperative to expand, the issue of joining was not resolved. This energy was held back until the village building work team came to the village after the wheat harvest, and those activists were the first to ask to join the cooperative.

Now, the Xiaoguang Cooperative has expanded from the original eleven households to 144 households. At the same time, two new cooperatives have been established, one with 34 households and one with 81 households. In this way, 80% of the households in the village have joined the cooperative.

This is the result of about two months of work. When the village building work team arrived in the village, no matter how eagerly the activists who wanted to join the cooperative were, the cadres of the work team studied the ideological situation of the local farmers and decided to first lead the masses to widely discuss and deliberate on the work of building the cooperative, which took the longest time in the process of building the cooperative. Because everyone's thoughts are uneven. When the Xiaoguang Cooperative was first established last year, some people shook their heads and disapproved. Many people were "waiting and seeing." After watching for a year, they saw the trick; some of those who shook their heads last year have become activists who want to join the cooperative this year. However, there are still many people who, although the request to join the cooperative has taken a step forward, still have to "consider and discuss" before joining.

Since the establishment of the Xiaoguang Cooperative last year, agricultural cooperatives have been a topic of daily discussion. However, at that time, they were talking about cooperatives and talking more about others. Less than a year later, the topic shifted to their own joining the cooperative.

The discussions are heated. They talk about it when working in the fields, and they talk about it when resting. They hold family meetings to discuss and argue... How many people are so excited that they can't sleep at night! Some people think back and forth, and lose sleep due to excessive thinking!

What are they thinking about, and what are the problems? Some old men think:
"If the land is used uniformly, where will people be buried after they die? Besides, if we use tractors in the future, that thing will plow the land, and it used to be a large area. Won't it level the graves?" Some women ask: "If livestock and carts are priced and put into the cooperative, what will happen when we go back to our parents' home? If we join the cooperative and distribute grain according to labor and shares, will we also distribute firewood? If we don't distribute firewood, how will we have firewood to burn?" Some people with a lot of land and farm tools worry about whether the valuation of livestock and farm tools when joining the cooperative will be reasonable? Will they suffer losses after joining the cooperative? Many problems that should not have become problems in the first place have already been solved by the Xiaoguang Cooperative in fact and have been shown to everyone. Due to negligence or "caution," some people still take these as problems to consider before joining the cooperative.

The work team organized representative figures of various types to visit. They visited the old cooperative. They visited the tractor station plowing land for the Xujingzhang Agricultural Cooperative in Douma Township, Xingping County, which is adjacent. When the tractor started to operate on a large area of ​​land, some people measured the depth behind it, and some people specifically looked at what to do when the tractor plowed to the front of the grave. The tractor plowed deep and bypassed the grave, but the land around the grave was plowed very well. Everything was calm and uneventful. When they returned to the village, they said to everyone: "The tractor is good, it looks bulky, but it's very flexible when plowing!" "Look! The land plowed by the tractor is deep and even. How can it not produce more grain!" The original concerns about not being able to go back to their parents' home and about not having firewood to burn were eliminated. Whether it is Xiaoguang Cooperative or Xujingzhang Cooperative, they have all proved that: Farmers with livestock and vehicles will not only not suffer losses by joining the cooperative, but also have many benefits. Everyone joined the cooperative one after another.

The family of well-to-do middle peasant Feng Desheng used to have many concerns. He is now the deputy director of the Second Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative (the original Xiaoguang Cooperative was renamed the First Xiaoguang Agricultural Cooperative after its expansion, and the other two newly established cooperatives are the Second and Third Xiaoguang Agricultural Cooperatives). In the past, he had two big castrated oxen and a cart that everyone called "eight pieces on top and eight pieces below are complete" and "twenty-four heads are not exposed" (that is, the accessories on and under the cart are complete, and the front and rear ends of the cart have twenty-four places that are wrapped in iron). He used to live a hard life. Through the hands of his brothers, his family property gradually increased. He is diligent, going out early and returning late during busy farming seasons, seeing the stars on both ends, and engaging in sideline occupations during slack seasons, and can come up with many ways. He is thrifty, almost stingy. He told me about their family meeting to discuss joining the cooperative. I asked him if he had any concerns before that, and what were they? He said: "How can I not have concerns? Land and livestock used to be treated as lifelines, and I was so worried about them. I had to hand them over to the cooperative. How could I not have any concerns at first?" As he said this, he smiled openly. "That's right," he paused for a while and said: "After thinking about it, it's better to join the cooperative. We can harvest more grain, the valuation of livestock and farm tools is reasonable, and everyone is suitable and good. Someone asked me, 'Why do you want to join the cooperative?' 'What are your conditions for joining the cooperative?' I told him, that's why I want to join the cooperative. That's my condition. …The Communist Party and the People's Government's methods are not wrong, and there is nothing wrong with taking the socialist road!"

These are all things that happened before signing up to join the cooperative. When I left Liangsi Du Village, the three cooperatives had been organized and jointly held an establishment meeting. Because Xiaoguang First Cooperative is large and has many livestock, they couldn't find so many ready-made large houses for feeding livestock, so they were building livestock houses. The three cooperatives have all prepared fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides, and are about to start planting wheat, and have already made preliminary plans for the entire year's production next year. Combining with the formulation of production plans, the supply and marketing cooperative sent people to sign a supply and marketing combination contract for several products with Xiaoguang First Cooperative. The Shaanxi Machine Tractor Station, which is located in Douma Township, Xingping County, also sent people and is discussing and signing contracts for renting tractors for autumn plowing with the three cooperatives separately.

Everyone is excitedly busy working together for a bigger harvest and a richer life next year.

    在合作化的道路上
    ——记八百里秦川中的一个村庄
    本报记者　艾方
    九月中旬，我访问了陕西咸阳县的两寺渡村。这时候，村里的农民们正一面忙着准备秋收秋种，一面忙着扩大和建立农业生产合作社。
    这是个三百来户人家的村庄，座落在渭河岸上，是一个渡口。村的东西两头过去各有一个不大的寺院，因此叫两寺渡。
    这一带的土地很肥沃，是以富饶著名的八百里秦川上的一片土地，渠道纵横，盛产小麦和棉花。今年这里的小麦的收成是过去所没有过的丰收。秋季，玉蜀黍、谷子已经熟了，正待收割；棉田里遍地花白，男男女女从早到晚在地里摘花——到处又是一片丰收景象。
    富饶、美丽的两寺渡的农民，解放前过的是极其贫困的、恶劣的日子（大家都管两寺渡叫餄餎村，因为全村卖餄餎求生活的人很多）。解放以后，在党和人民政府的领导下，大家组织起来，一步步走向富裕。
    这里，晓光农业生产合作社（以下简称晓光社）和它的社员们，走在了大家的最前面。晓光社在这以前虽然也只有十一户社员，但它像一面旗帜一样指着大家的去路；这一带的大人小口没有不知道它的。晓光社的庄稼产量在当地是最高的。渭滨乡（辖两寺渡的乡）是今年咸阳县的丰产乡，平均每亩地产小麦三百二十斤，这是个不小的数目了，可是晓光社的土地平均每亩产量达到了三百七十多斤。秋庄稼虽然还没有收下来，产量不能最后确定，可是那些种地的老手，心里早有个数目了：单干户和互助组的玉蜀黍平均每亩可收三百斤、四百多斤，晓光社的平均每亩可达到六百斤；单干户和互助组的棉花平均每亩能收六十多斤近七十斤（皮花，下同），晓光社的每亩平均可收七十多斤近八十斤。大家都说，“社里的庄稼乌油油像油泼的”。晓光社的车辆、牲口是最强的，养的猪是最多最肥的。这里有一句形容殷实中农的话叫“四硬户”——土地硬、牲口硬、农具硬、劳力硬。可是任何一个四硬户，任何一个互助组的土地、牲口、农具和劳力，也比不上社里的硬。
    一天，社员冯增武吃罢晚饭，在他家里和我谈起他半生的生活。按照冯增武的说法，他这个原来种着七亩二分地的四口之家，解放前被三件事情（其实不止三件，而是他直接感到打击最重的三件）捆住了。第一，是国民党抽壮丁，抽过他两次，他没有去，就出钱、找人，两次出钱折合一千八百斤小麦；第二，是父亲死，送葬；第三，是房子毁了，盖了间小房。从此，他背上了很高利息的债。他说：
  “加上地土少，漂不住个牲口，也就积不下粪，庄稼长不好，一年收下的粮食，吃了就还不上利钱，还上利钱就没啥吃！办法都想尽了，给人家拉长工，卖短工……还是不行……。”说着，他摆一摆手，似乎表示过去的事情已经一章揭过，不必再提。
    解放后冯增武从高利贷的束缚下解脱出来。他参加了互助组。虽说一直到入社前，他们的互助组办的并不很好，但生活仍是渐渐上升的。他说：
  “这几年家里的收入能都和今年收入一样，那光景早就更好了！”他这话是有根据的。今年晓光社麦收预分，他分到了一千七百五十五斤小麦，还有副业分红，共四十四万元。只是小麦的收入，就比去年在互助组的时候多一千三百七十五斤。这只是他全年总收入的一部分。现在晓光社的全年总收入的估算，已经算出来了。他夫妇俩已经做了一百五十多个劳动日，估计全年可做一百八十个劳动日，每个劳动日可以分一万七千元左右，这样，劳动分红，他全年可以分三百万元左右，加上土地分红，全家全年可以收入四百来万元。把这些钱折成麦子，将近四千斤。这是冯增武从来没有过的一年的收入。
    不只是多分了粮食，社员们对统一经营土地、初步分工、集体干活的好处的体会是深刻的。所有过去有牲口的社员都说：过去种地难啊！忙时候，人和牲口一齐下地，一齐回家，牲口休息了，人不能休息——要先推两车子土给牲口垫垫圈，没有水要提水，夜里一次又一次地起来拌草喂牲口，睡不了好觉。现在，有专人喂牲口，有专人搞副业，农作活大家分配好，一个心地干活，心静、痛快、出活，还不显得累。过去没牲口的社员说：过去种地难！样样操持，种子、肥料……就是组成了互助组，牲口、农具问题解决了，别的问题还是很多。入了社，过去解决不了的问题，都解决了。
    这些事实着实挑动人心。今年春天，晓光社的麦苗长起来，“到底还是社里的麦子好”已成定论的时候，有些人就到晓光社去，要求参加进来。因为当时晓光社不是扩大的时机，入社问题没有解决。这股劲一直蹩到麦后建社工作组到村上，那些积极分子就首先要求入社了。
    现在，晓光社已经从原来的十一户扩大到一百四十四户。同时又建立了两个新社，一个三十四户、一个八十一户。这样，全村百分之八十的户数都入了社。
    这是经过了两个月左右工作的结果。当建社工作组到村的时候，尽管要求入社的积极分子如何迫不及待，工作组的干部研究了当地农民的思想状况之后，还是决定首先领导群众广泛展开建社工作的酝酿讨论，这在建社过程中占的时间最长。因为大家的思想是参差不齐的。去年晓光社才建立的时候，有些人就曾摇头，不以为然。很多人在“等一等、看一看”。看了一年，看出名堂来了；去年摇头的，有的变成了今年要求入社的积极分子。但是，还有很多人，虽然入社的要求进了一步，要入社了，还得“考虑考虑，商量商量”。
    自从去年晓光社建立以后，农业社就是大家日常谈论的一个题目。不过那时是谈社，谈别人的多，时间隔了不到一年，话锋转到自己入社的问题上来了。
    谈论是热烈的。在地里干活的时候谈，休息的时候也谈，开家庭会商量、争论，……多少人兴奋得夜间失眠了！有些人思前想后，因思虑过多而失眠了！
    思虑些什么，有些什么问题呢？有的老汉想：
  “地统一使用了，以后人死了往那儿埋？再说，以后要使用拖拉机了，那家伙翻地，过去就是一大片，不把坟头荡平了吗？”有的妇女问：“牲口、大车作价入社了，走娘家怎么办？入了社按劳、按股分粮食，是不是也分柴？不分柴，没柴烧怎么办？”有些土地、农具多的，顾虑入社的牲口、农具折价会不会合理？入社后自己会不会吃亏？许多问题，本来是不应该成为问题的，晓光社事实上也早已解决，并显示给大家看了的。由于疏忽或者是
  “慎重”，在入社之前，有些人仍拿这些作为问题来考虑。
    工作组组织各类型代表性的人物参观。访问老社。他们参观了拖拉机站给临近的兴平县窦马乡许敬章农业社耕地。当拖拉机在大片土地上开动起来的时候，有的人在后面量深度，有的专看拖拉机耕到坟头前怎么办。拖拉机耕的深，绕过坟头，坟头周围的地耕得却很好。一切平静无事。他们回到村里，逢人便说：“拖拉机就是好，看起来笨重，翻起地来却怪灵便哩！”“看！那拖拉机翻的地又深又匀，怎么能不多打粮食！”原来顾虑没法走娘家的，顾虑没柴烧的，顾虑消除了。无论晓光社或者是许敬章社，都同样证明了：有牲口车辆的农民入社不但不吃亏，同样有很多好处。大家纷纷入社了。
    殷实中农冯德升的家庭，就曾经是顾虑很多的。他现在是第二晓光农业生产合作社的副主任（原来的晓光社扩大后改名为第一晓光农业社，其他两个新建社为第二、第三晓光农业社）。过去他有两头大犍牛，一辆大家所说的“上八件下八件齐全”、“二十四头不露”的大车（即车上车下附件齐全，车的前后顶头有二十四处都用铁包了的）。他原来过的也是苦日子，经过他弟兄的手，家当渐渐大了些。他勤劳，农忙的时候，早出晚归，两头见星星，农闲的时候搞副业，会想出很多办法。他节约，近于吝啬。他把他们开家庭会讨论入社的情形，都告诉给我。我问他，在那以前他有没有顾虑，顾虑些什么？他说：“怎么没有顾虑？土地、牲口，过去都当命根子，心系子么，要交到社里去，开始还能没有点顾虑？”说着，他坦然地笑了。“是这样，”他停了一会说：“一考虑，还是入社好，粮食收的多，牲口、农具折价合理，大家都合适、都好。有人问我‘你为啥要入社？’‘有什么条件入社？’我告诉他，我就是为这要入社。这就是我的条件。……共产党和人民政府的办法没有错，走社会主义的路没有错！”
    这都是报名入社之前的事。我离开两寺渡村的时候，三个社已经组织就绪，共同开了成立大会。晓光一社因为社大，牲口多，找不到那么些现成的喂牲口的大房子，正在盖牲口房。三个社都已经准备好了肥料、种子、农药，就要开始种麦，并且已经作出了明年全年生产的初步计划。结合订生产计划，供销合作社派人和晓光一社订立几项产品的供销结合合同。住在兴平县窦马乡的陕西机器拖拉机站也派了人，正和三个社分头商订租用拖拉机秋耕的合同。
    大家共同在为明年更大的丰收和更富裕的生活而兴奋地忙碌着。
