Anshan Iron and Steel Company Refractory Materials Plant and the refractory materials workshops of Tangshan Steel Plant and Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, with the help of Soviet refractory material expert Smirnov, have successfully trial-produced high-alumina bricks using high-bauxite. The quality of the trial products has been repeatedly tested and proven to fully meet the requirements. The results of trial use in steelmaking open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, and steel ladles are very good.

The alumina content of the high-alumina bricks trial-produced by each plant reached 60% to 90%. The refractoriness, compressive strength, resistance to temperature shock, and resistance to steel slag erosion of this high-alumina brick are far superior to ordinary refractory bricks. Using it to build the water jacket part of the combustion port of the steelmaking open-hearth furnace and the furnace wall of the steel billet heating furnace can extend the service life by more than double that of ordinary refractory bricks. Extending the life of the furnace can reduce repair time and increase steel production. In the past, the refractory bricks used by Anshan Iron and Steel Plant and Chongqing 101 Steel Plant for pouring steel were of poor quality, and steel ladles often leaked steel. Since using high-alumina bricks, steel leakage accidents have been reduced or avoided.

Manufacturing high-alumina bricks with high-bauxite has a lower cost and high quality. Due to restrictions on raw material sources and raw material quality, other countries generally use industrial alumina, which is very costly and requires complex operating techniques, as raw material when manufacturing high-alumina bricks. However, China has abundant reserves, high grades, and wide distribution of bauxite, which can be fully utilized. In the past, because China did not know how to use it, much bauxite was abandoned. After Soviet expert Smirnov discovered it, he studied the properties of China's bauxite and considered it a valuable raw material for manufacturing high-alumina bricks. He proposed and guided Tangshan Steel Plant, Anshan Refractory Materials Plant, and other units to conduct trial production, and pointed out the technical direction for manufacturing high-alumina bricks, such as "high-temperature calcination of bauxite clinker" and "fine particle size and high-pressure mechanical forming." Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the employees of Tangshan Steel Plant and other units have successively achieved successful trial production. During the trial production and trial use of high-alumina bricks, the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry also carried out a series of experimental research work to help the smooth progress of the trial production work.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry is further organizing the trial production of high-alumina bricks and preparing to organize mass production in various factories. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 鞍钢和唐山钢厂等试制高铝砖成功

    鞍钢和唐山钢厂等试制高铝砖成功
    鞍山钢铁公司耐火材料厂和唐山钢厂、重庆一零一钢铁厂的耐火材料车间，在苏联耐火材料专家斯米尔诺夫的帮助下，利用高矾土试制高铝砖成功。试制品的质量经多次检验，证明完全达到了要求，在炼钢平炉、电炉上和盛钢桶上试用的结果很好。
    各厂试制的高铝砖所含的氧化铝达到百分之六十到九十。这种高铝砖的耐火度、耐压强度、对温度激变的抵抗性能和对钢渣浸蚀的抵抗性能，比普通的耐火砖优越得多。用它修砌炼钢平炉燃烧口的水套部分和钢胚加热炉的炉壁，使用寿命可以比用普通耐火砖延长一倍以上。延长了炉子的寿命，就可以减少修理时间，提高钢铁的产量。过去鞍钢炼钢厂和重庆一零一钢铁厂浇钢时使用的耐火砖质量不好，盛钢桶经常漏钢。使用高铝砖以后，已经减少或避免了漏钢事故。
    用高矾土制造高铝砖，成本较低而质量很高。别的国家因受原料来源和原料质量的限制，在制造高铝砖时一般都要用成本很高而操作技术复杂的工业氧化铝作原料。而我国却有蕴藏量丰富、品位很高、矿产分布很广的高矾土，可以充分利用。过去因为我国不会利用，许多高矾土都被抛弃了。苏联专家斯米尔诺夫发现以后，研究了我国的高矾土的性能，认为是制造高铝砖的宝贵原料。他提议并指导唐山钢厂、鞍钢耐火材料厂等单位进行试制，并指出采用“高温度煅烧矾土熟料”、“细颗粒度和高压机械成型”等制造高铝砖的技术方向。唐山钢厂等单位的职工在苏联专家的指导下，已先后试制成功。在试制和试用高铝砖期间，中国科学院金属研究所和重工业部钢铁试验所也作了一系列的试验研究工作，帮助了试制工作的顺利进行。
    重工业部正在进一步组织高铝砖的试制工作，并准备组织各厂大量生产。　（新华社）
