Repudiate Dulles's Arrogant Ranting

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a statement at a press conference on November 16, attempting to obliterate our country's sacred sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands with an arrogant and unreasonable tone. He openly stated that the United States would use armed intervention against our country's just actions to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands of our mainland. This arrogant ranting by Dulles once again clearly exposes the ambition of the American aggressor group to continue occupying our country's sacred territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands in order to further implement its aggression against our country. The 600 million Chinese people cannot but express great anger at Dulles's arrogant ranting.

Hostility towards the Chinese people and aggression against the People's Republic of China are important components of the American aggressor group's pursuit of world hegemony and its war and aggression policies aimed at re-escalating the international situation. After the Geneva Conference, the American aggressor group, disregarding the failures of its war and aggression policies, intensified the organization of military blocs in Europe and Asia to create new war crises. At the November 16 press conference, Dulles openly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference on November 29 to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, thereby demonstrating the American aggressor group's determination to coerce its followers in Western Europe to implement the Paris Accords, which would revive West German militarism and intensify the tense situation in Europe. In Asia, Dulles also advocated, in a speech to the U.S. Senate on November 11, that a Southeast Asia military bloc conference should be convened to discuss further suppressing the national liberation movements of Asian countries. Regarding our territory of Taiwan, the United States has continuously strengthened its naval and air forces in Taiwan and along the Chinese coast, increased military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and repeatedly threatened to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Dulles's statement at the November 16 press conference is a prominent manifestation of the American aggressor group's consistent actions of hostility towards the Chinese people.

Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's remnant forces are entirely internal affairs of China. Any foreign forces attempting to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan are a crude interference in China's internal affairs. This is not only absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people but also opposed by all peace-loving people in the world. Precisely because of this, Dulles, in his statement on the 16th, attempted to use the cunning trick of obliterating the Chinese people's sacred sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to create an excuse for the American occupation of Taiwan.

Dulles said that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands "have a special legal status," and that "Japan has given up its rights to these areas it controlled before the war, but these areas have never been transferred to any other country." This is clearly utter nonsense. The historical fact is that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have always been part of Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese surrender terms all repeatedly confirmed that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. The Cairo Declaration of China, the United States, and Great Britain clearly stipulated that the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, should be returned to China. The "United States Relations with China" White Paper, published by the U.S. State Department in August 1949, also stated that "The people of Taiwan, under alien rule for fifty years, welcomed Chinese liberation. During the period of Japanese occupation, the greatest hope of the Taiwanese people was to return to the motherland." In December of the same year, the U.S. State Department's policy directive on Taiwan stated: "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China." Truman's statement regarding Taiwan in January 1950 further explicitly acknowledged: "For the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island." Isn't this clear enough? But Dulles now says that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands have some kind of "special legal status," attempting to fundamentally deny the Chinese people's sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. How absurd is this!

Dulles's reference to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands having some kind of "special legal status" is clearly an attempt to use the illegal San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan, orchestrated by the United States in September 1951, to confuse the public. People know that in this unilateral treaty with Japan, on the one hand, it stipulated that Japan "renounce" control over our territories of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and on the other hand, it deliberately did not clearly stipulate that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands be returned to China, thus leaving a loophole for the United States to further occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The Chinese people saw through this American conspiracy when the United States was unilaterally concluding a treaty with Japan. In his statement issued on August 15, 1951, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai clearly condemned this criminal conspiracy of the United States, stating that the U.S. draft treaty with Japan and the San Francisco conference were illegal. Today, Dulles's attempt to use the corpse of this notorious treaty with Japan to deceive is naturally futile.

Simultaneously with deception and lies, Dulles threatened in a provocative tone that the Chinese people's liberation of their own country's sacred territory of Taiwan "could lead to hostile action with the United States." Not only that, Dulles openly admitted that the United States is closer than ever to concluding a "bilateral mutual security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is to enable the United States to "freely decide" to use force to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, blatantly demonstrating the American aggressors' flagrant attempt to further interfere in China's internal affairs and fix the crime of forcibly occupying Taiwan in treaty form in order to engage in greater military adventures against China.

It is known to the world that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only a public enemy of the Chinese people but also a public enemy of the peace-loving people of the world. This remnant clique, which has been abandoned by the Chinese people, cannot live for a day without the support of American bayonets. Its only profession is to serve as a tool for American aggressors to provoke a new world war. Therefore, the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is precisely to eliminate the danger of Taiwan being used as a hotbed for creating a new war, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. If the American aggressors dare to conclude a "bilateral mutual security treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to stand against the great Chinese people to the end, and disregard the world people's desire for peace, then they must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

It is entirely understandable that various parties are increasingly expressing deep unease about the grave situation created by the American aggression against Taiwan. However, anyone who truly cares about the current situation in Asia and is willing to work to ease the situation in Asia should demand that the American armed forces completely withdraw from Chinese territory and stop the United States from interfering in China's internal affairs. Only in this way is it the only correct way to solve the Taiwan problem and maintain peace. Some people want to find a so-called "way out" through other channels, but there is no such "way out"; all such plans, such as the absurd proposals of so-called "Taiwan neutralization," "UN trusteeship," "independent state of Taiwan," etc., are actually a concession and encouragement to the American policy of aggression.

Today, due to the American occupation of our country's Taiwan and the continued implementation of its policy of aggression against our country, peace and security in Asia are seriously threatened. The Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan is not only to ensure the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty but also to help ease the tense situation in Asia. Any actions by the American aggressor group to obstruct and interfere in our liberation of Taiwan will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan is unwavering; no force in the world can absolutely stop the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

### 斥杜勒斯的狂妄叫嚣

    斥杜勒斯的狂妄叫嚣
    美国国务卿杜勒斯十一月十六日在记者招待会上发表谈话，以横蛮无理的口吻妄图抹煞我国对台湾和澎湖列岛的神圣主权，并公然表示美国要对我国解放台湾、澎湖列岛以及我国大陆沿海岛屿的正义行动进行武装干涉。杜勒斯的这种狂妄叫嚣，再次清楚地暴露了美国侵略集团企图继续霸占我国的神圣领土台湾和澎湖列岛，以进一步实行对我国侵略的野心。六万万中国人民对于杜勒斯的这种狂妄的叫嚣不能不表示极大的愤怒。
    敌视中国人民和对中华人民共和国实行侵略，是美国侵略集团追求世界霸权、重新恶化国际局势的战争政策和侵略政策的重要组成部分。日内瓦会议以后，美国侵略集团不顾它的战争政策和侵略政策所遭受到的失败，在欧洲和亚洲加紧组织军事集团，以制造新的战争危机。杜勒斯在十六日的记者招待会上就公开拒绝苏联关于在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议以讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题的建议，从而表明美国侵略集团决心胁迫其在西欧的追随者实施重新复活西德军国主义的巴黎协定，以加剧欧洲的紧张形势。在亚洲，杜勒斯也在十一月十一日美国参议院的发言中，主张要召开一次东南亚军事集团会议，来商讨进一步镇压亚洲各国的民族解放运动。对于我国领土台湾，美国更不断加强它在台湾和中国沿海的海空军力量，增加对蒋介石残余匪帮的军事援助，并一再扬言要干涉我国解放台湾和澎湖列岛。杜勒斯在十一月十六日记者招待会上的谈话，就是美国侵略集团一贯敌视中国人民的行径的突出的表现。
    台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分。中国人民要解放自己国土台湾、肃清蒋介石卖国集团残余势力，完全是中国的内政问题。任何外国势力要想阻挠中国人民解放台湾，就是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。这不仅是中国人民所绝对不能容许的，也是全世界一切爱好和平人民所反对的。正因为如此，所以杜勒斯在他十六日的谈话中，就想用抹煞中国人民对台湾和澎湖列岛的神圣主权的诡诈手法，来替美国侵占台湾制造借口。
    杜勒斯说，台湾和澎湖列岛“具有一种特殊的法律地位”，“日本已放弃了它对这些它战前所控制的地区的权利，但是这些地区从没有被再转让给任何其他国家。”这显然是一种彻头彻尾的胡说。历史的事实是，台湾和澎湖列岛历来就是中国领土的一部分。开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和日本投降条款，都曾一再确认台湾和澎湖列岛应当归还中国。中美英三国开罗宣言明白规定：日本所窃取于中国的领土，如满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等，应归还中国。一九四九年八月美国国务院发表的“中美关系”白皮书中也说：“台湾人民受异族管辖达五十年，因之欢迎中国解放。于日本占领时期中，台湾人民最大之希望为重归祖国。”同年十二月美国国务院关于台湾的政策宣传指示中又说：“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分”。一九五○年一月杜鲁门关于台湾的声明更确切承认：“过去四年来，美国及其他盟国亦承认中国对该岛行使主权。”难道这还不清楚吗？可是杜勒斯现在却说台湾和澎湖列岛具有什么“特殊的法律地位”，企图根本否认中国人民对台湾和澎湖列岛的主权，这是何等的荒谬啊！
    杜勒斯所指的台湾和澎湖列岛具有什么“特殊的法律地位”，显然是企图搬用一九五一年九月美国在旧金山导演的非法对日和约来混淆听闻的。人们知道：在这个片面对日和约中，一面规定日本“放弃”对我国领土台湾和澎湖列岛的控制，一面又故意不明白规定台湾和澎湖列岛归还中国，这就为美国进一步侵占台湾和澎湖列岛留下后路。中国人民还在美国进行单独缔结对日和约的时候，就看穿了美国的这种阴谋。我国周恩来外长于一九五一年八月十五日发表的声明中，便曾明白地指斥了美国的这种罪恶阴谋，声明美国单独对日和约草案和旧金山会议是非法的。今天，杜勒斯要搬用这具臭名远扬的对日和约的僵尸来进行欺骗，自然是无济于事的。
    与欺骗和撒谎同时，杜勒斯以挑衅的口吻恫吓说：中国人民解放自己的祖国的神圣领土台湾，
  “可能引起与美国的敌对行动。”不仅如此，杜勒斯公开承认，美国比过去任何时候都更接近于同蒋介石卖国集团缔结“共同安全双边条约”，这就是为了使美国可以“自由决定”以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾，露骨地表明了美国侵略者悍然企图进一步干涉中国的内政，把强占台湾的罪行用条约形式固定下来，以便对中国从事更大的军事冒险。
    举世周知蒋介石卖国集团不仅是中国人民的公敌，而且是世界爱好和平人民的公敌。这个被中国人民所唾弃的残余集团，一天也离不开美国的刺刀的支撑，它的唯一的职业，就是作为美国侵略者的工具，挑起新的世界大战。因此，中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，正是为了消除台湾被作为制造新战争的温床的危险，为了保卫远东及世界和平。如果美国侵略者胆敢与蒋介石卖国集团缔结
  “共同安全双边条约”，要同伟大的中国人民作对到底，置世界人民的和平意志于不顾，那就必须承担由此产生的一切严重的后果。
    对美国侵略台湾所造成的这种严重局势，各方日益表示深切的不安，这是完全可以理解的。但是，任何人，如果真正关怀当前的亚洲局势，并愿为缓和亚洲局势而努力，就应该要求美国的武装力量完全撤出中国的领土，制止美国干涉中国内政。只有这样，才是解决台湾问题、维护和平的唯一正确途径。有些人想从别的途径来找寻所谓“出路”，但是，这样的“出路”是不会有的；一切这样的打算，例如所谓“台湾中立化”、“联合国托管”、
  “台湾独立国”等等荒谬主张，实际上都是对美国侵略政策的屈从和鼓励。
    今天，由于美国侵占我国台湾，继续执行侵略我国的政策，亚洲的和平与安全严重地受到威胁。中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，不但是为了保障我国领土主权的完整，并且也有助于缓和亚洲的紧张局势的。美国侵略集团任何阻挠和干涉我国解放台湾的行动，必然会遭到六万万中国人民坚决的反对。中国人民解放台湾的决心是坚定不移的；世界上任何势力都绝对阻挡不住中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。
