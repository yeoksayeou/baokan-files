Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 23rd: According to TASS, the Twelfth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party continued on the 22nd. Tsendiin Duguarsüren, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a report on the directives for the development of the Second Five-Year Plan of the Mongolian People's Republic.

He pointed out that the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan from 1947 to 1952 proved that the Mongolian people had achieved great accomplishments.

The tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan from 1953 to 1957 are to further develop the main sectors of the economy of the Mongolian People's Republic—animal husbandry—while also developing industry, transportation, and postal and telecommunications services, and on this basis, to ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

Tsendiin Duguarsüren said that the Party and the government's policy in agriculture is to strengthen the socialist components and fully support the working herders.

The focus of the Second Five-Year Plan is to develop animal husbandry, increase livestock numbers, and improve the productivity of livestock products, as well as greatly develop other sectors of agriculture. The total state investment in agriculture during the Second Five-Year Plan will increase to approximately seven times that of the First Five-Year Plan.

By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total number of livestock will increase to 27.5 million head, an increase of 20.7 percent compared to 1952, of which the livestock on state-owned farms will triple, the livestock of herding production cooperatives will increase ninefold, and the livestock of individual herders will increase by 10 percent. The directives of the Second Five-Year Plan stipulate that veterinary and animal husbandry work should be thoroughly improved, and feed reserves should be greatly increased.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to ensure that at least 50 percent of the residents' grain needs can be met domestically. The issue of increasing grain production should first be resolved by state-owned farms.

The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that domestic industrial production should be greatly increased on the basis of the continuous development and consolidation of the material and technical foundation of industry. The total industrial investment will increase to 6.6 times that of the First Five-Year Plan. The level of industrial production will increase by 46 percent compared to 1952. The proportion of state-owned industrial production (including cooperative enterprises) in the country's industrial production will increase from 75.2 percent in 1953 to 77.2 percent in 1957.

The production of consumer goods will be greatly increased, and great attention will be paid to the development of the food industry.

In his report, Tsendiin Duguarsüren also emphasized the tasks in terms of commodity circulation, transportation, and postal and telecommunications services. The new Five-Year Plan stipulates that the important industrial products and food products sold to residents should be increased by one and a half to two times. In addition to reducing retail prices of daily necessities and increasing wages for workers, it also stipulates expanding housing and public facilities construction.

The directives attach great importance to the further development of people's health care. The number of domestic doctors will increase by more than two and a half times, while the number of medical stations will double.

In terms of cultural education, the current primary task in the Second Five-Year Plan is to ensure universal primary compulsory education for children in rural areas and to prepare for the implementation of seven-year universal compulsory education in cities. In order to ensure the supply of highly skilled personnel in the national economy sectors, the number of advanced professional talents cultivated in the Republic's institutions of higher learning from 1953 to 1957 will increase to 2.8 times that of the First Five-Year Plan.

The state also plans to open an agricultural college in 1956, as well as other secondary technical schools to train professional talents for the mining industry, food industry, and railway transportation industry.

Tsendiin Duguarsüren concluded by saying that the huge plans for the development of the Mongolian People's Republic formulated by our Party along the path of socialist construction require great effort and a lot of funds to complete. For example, from 1953 to 1957, the total investment in national economic and cultural construction will increase by approximately 2.7 times that of the First Five-Year Plan. Our people, relying on the comprehensive assistance of their brothers and friends—the great Soviet people—and relying on cooperation with the great Chinese people and all countries of the powerful socialist camp, continue to achieve many new glorious victories under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party.

After Tsendiin Duguarsüren's report, the conference began discussions.

    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社乌兰巴托讯：蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会二十二日继续进行。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会政治局委员锡林迪布在会上作了关于蒙古人民共和国发展第二个五年计划的指示的报告。
    他指出，一九四七年到一九五二年第一个五年计划的执行结果证明，蒙古人民获得了巨大的成就。
    从一九五三年到一九五七年的第二个五年计划的任务是：进一步发展蒙古人民共和国经济的主要部门——畜牧业，同时也要发展工业、运输业和邮电事业，并在这个基础上，保证不断提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平。
    锡林迪布说，党和政府在农业方面的政策是：加强社会主义成分，全力支持劳动牧民。
    第二个五年计划的重点是：发展畜牧业，增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜产品的生产率，大大发展农业的其他部门。第二个五年计划时期国家对农业的投资总额将增为第一个五年计划的七倍左右。
    到第二个五年计划结束时，牲畜总头数将增加到二千七百五十万头，比一九五二年增加百分之二十点七，其中国营牧场的牲畜增为三倍，牧民生产合作社的增为九倍，个体牧民的增加百分之十。第二个五年计划的指示规定，彻底改善兽医和饲畜工作，大大增加饲料储备。
    在第二个五年计划中，要保证居民的粮食至少有百分之五十能够自给自足。增加谷物生产的问题首先应该由国营农场来解决。
    第二个五年计划规定，在不断发展和巩固工业物质技术基础的基础上大力增加国内的工业生产。工业投资总额将增为第一个五年计划的六点六倍。工业生产水平将比一九五二年提高百分之四十六。国营工业生产（包括合作社企业）在全国工业生产中的比重将从一九五三年的百分之七十五点二增加到一九五七年的百分之七十七点二。
    消费品的生产将要大大增加，并大力注意食品工业的发展。
    锡林迪布在报告中也着重谈到商品流转、运输和邮电方面的任务。新的五年计划规定使出售给居民的重要工业品和食品增为一倍半到两倍。除降低日用品零售价格和提高职工工资外，同时规定扩大住宅和公用设备建筑。
    指示中十分重视进一步发展人民保健事业。国内医生人数将增为两倍半以上，而医疗站的数目将增为两倍。
    在文化教育方面，第二个五年计划中当前首要的任务是保证农村地区儿童的初级普及义务教育，并准备在城市中实行七年制普及义务教育。为了保证供给国民经济部门中具有高度业务水平的干部，一九五三年到一九五七年在共和国高等学校中培养的高等专业人材将增为第一个五年计划年代的两点八倍。
    国家还打算在一九五六年开办一所农业学院，以及为采矿工业、食品工业和铁路运输业培养专业人材的其他中等技术学校。
    锡林迪布最后说，我们党按社会主义建设的道路拟订的发展蒙古人民共和国的巨大计划，需要用很大努力和很多资金来完成它。例如，一九五三年到一九五七年，在国民经济和文化建设方面的投资总额就约增为第一个五年计划的二点七倍。我们的人民依靠着自己的兄弟和朋友——伟大的苏联人民——的全面帮助，依靠着同伟大的中国人民和强大的社会主义阵营所有国家的合作，在人民革命党的领导下不断获得许多新的光荣的胜利。
    锡林迪布报告后，会议开始了讨论。
