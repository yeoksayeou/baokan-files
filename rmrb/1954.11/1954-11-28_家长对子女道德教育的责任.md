Parents' Responsibility for Children's Moral Education

    Recent survey materials from youth league organizations in various regions and materials published in newspapers and periodicals show that one of the fundamental reasons why a small number of young people and teenagers have become tainted with strong hooliganistic habits, and even embarked on the road of corruption and degeneration, is the inadequacy of family education. In order to plug this loophole, parents should earnestly take on the responsibility of educating their children and use correct viewpoints and methods to cultivate their children's communist moral character.

    In our country, due to changes in social relations and the Party's education of the masses, new family relationships are growing. Many wise parents are very concerned about their children's studies, lives, and moral behavior, and can use correct viewpoints and methods to educate their children. However, not every parent knows their educational responsibility towards their children. Some cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and teachers have abandoned the responsibility of educating their children, and do not care about their children's studies and moral behavior. They believe that since their children have entered school, the responsibility for education can be completely borne by the teachers, and that they are too busy with work to educate their children. The result of this "raising without teaching" is very bad. According to a survey conducted by the Beijing Education Bureau this summer, 133 students in 64 secondary schools were tainted with strong hooliganistic habits. Among these students, the largest number were children from exploiting-class families, totaling 44, followed by children of cadres, technical personnel, and teachers, totaling 33. National functionaries who are parents should pay sufficient attention to this situation.

    Schools have the main responsibility for the communist moral education of the younger generation. However, schools are not the only educational institution; they must have the cooperation of social education, especially family education. Because parents are the child's first teachers, long before the child enters school, family education has already had a profound influence on the child and cultivated certain habits. If family education is inadequate and creates some defects in the child's character, it will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of school education. Even after entering school, family education will continue to have a profound influence on the child. Parents always have an inescapable responsibility to educate their children.

    As for saying that national functionaries are too busy with work and have no time to educate their children, this is just an exaggeration, or rather, just an excuse. National functionaries are indeed very busy with their work; but if they take some time to educate their children, even if they are more responsible cadres, that is entirely possible. "China Youth" once published an article entitled "Talk After the Trial." This article introduced a Soviet engineering economist who, because he "had no time to take care of his child," caused his only son to degenerate into a criminal and was sentenced to twenty years in prison. After the sentence was pronounced, he said with deep regret: "What does it mean to say I had no time to take care of him? Did I have time to play poker with friends, watch football games, and build villas? It's not a matter of not having time; I could have gone to school, I could have talked to my son in detail, but I didn't do it." So it's not a matter of whether there is time, but whether there is a sense of responsibility to educate children, and whether there is a real understanding of the importance of educating children for the future of the country.

    Many parents only pampering spoil their children and do not know how to educate them. They feel that the most ideal life of their children is the most comfortable life, and they try every means to arrange such a life for their children, imperceptibly instilling in their children the idea of ​​avoiding work and seeking pleasure. They even take a completely laissez-faire attitude towards their children's daily behavior, listening to whatever their children say and doing whatever they do, and sometimes even concealing their children's wrong behavior in front of teachers, or even defending their children's wrong behavior. This fosters some children's bad habits of disobeying discipline and being willful. This view and method of treating children is the bourgeois view and method, which is commonplace in bourgeois families; however, some families of other classes, even communist families, are also influenced by bourgeois ideas and use this view and method to educate their children. This has become a common problem in family education.

    Parents should cherish their children very much, but pampering and spoiling are not true cherishing, and can only create various defects in the child's psychology. They should be concerned about their children's health in every way, urge and guide their children to study hard, and cultivate their children's good character. In particular, attention should be paid to cultivating children's labor concepts and labor habits from an early age, and allowing children to engage in labor within their capabilities according to their age characteristics, so that they can become excellent laborers when they grow up. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the children's daily behavior, and the children's communist moral character should be cultivated by means of patient persuasion and subtle influence. If any wrong behavior is found in the children, even if it seems to be not very serious, it should be educated and corrected in time, and attention should be paid to the method of education. Some parents treat their children in a rude way. As soon as their children make a mistake, they scold them loudly, or even beat them severely. This method is completely wrong, it can only hinder the normal development of the child's body and mind, and has no effect on correcting the child's mistakes. Parents should not take this attitude. At the same time, parents should also pay attention to the significant impact of their words and deeds on their children, and check themselves at any time.

    Our country's complex and sharp class struggle during the transition period has also caused some special problems in family relations. Some capitalists who attempt to resist socialist transformation, in order to try their best to win over their children to stand on their side, do not hesitate to take some despicable means, such as providing a large amount of money for their children to squander, and inducing their children to hang out in low-class entertainment venues, so that they gradually degenerate and become corrupted. These evil capitalists should be warned that they cannot poison their children; and their children should be exposed to their conspiracies, and these young people and teenagers should be educated to see and cherish their bright future, treat their families with the correct attitude, strictly draw a line in their thinking with their families, and not be deceived by their families. The educational administrative departments and youth league organizations in various regions should pay attention to this special problem in family education in our country and solve it in their actual work.

    In terms of family education, national functionaries (especially party cadres) who are parents have a particularly important responsibility. This is not only because they are parents and must fulfill their obligation to educate their children; but also because they are national functionaries and have a responsibility to be a model for the masses in all aspects, including family education, and to lead the masses to work together to cultivate the communist moral character of the younger generation. If party members, especially more responsible party cadres, do not fulfill their parental obligations and take a wrong attitude towards their children, the party organization should educate and criticize them and order them to correct their mistakes. We cannot allow party members to have a dual personality, that is, to abide by the communist moral principles only in the office, but to be casual when they return home and become a bad parent.

    It is necessary to strengthen the connection between schools and families, so that family education and school education are closely integrated. Once children enter school, their education must be jointly responsible by the school and the family. The school should understand the students' performance in the family, and the family should understand the children's performance in the school. Because schools are specialized educational institutions and teachers have specialized educational knowledge, schools should actively establish regular and close ties with parents. To give families more help, use the form of parent meetings and home visits, and conduct targeted publicity on educational common sense among parents, guiding parents to be good at using correct viewpoints and methods to educate their children. Parents should respect the school, respect the teachers, take the initiative to visit the school, understand the children's studies and moral behavior, and often tell the school about the children's performance in the family, giving the school active help.

    Caring for children's communist moral education should become the ethos of the new society. This ethos cannot be formed naturally, it depends on the promotion of public opinion. Therefore, newspapers and periodicals should strengthen publicity in this regard, praise the good, criticize the bad, and constantly give parents' thinking a positive influence. In order to help parents master the correct viewpoints and methods of educating their children, more specialized newspapers and periodicals should also appropriately introduce scientific knowledge of educating their children. At present, the average parents in our country lack this knowledge, so this publicity work is even more important.

    From the work of organizing graduates of senior elementary schools and junior high schools to engage in productive labor, various regions have realized the necessity of strengthening family education, and have already done some work; in the recent struggle against the corrosion of bourgeois ideology on young people, there has been a further understanding of this issue. On the basis of this understanding, and according to past experiences and lessons, the work of organizing family education should be carefully checked, and future work plans should be determined, so that family education can closely cooperate with school education and social education, and play a greater role in the communist moral education of the younger generation.

### 家长对子女道德教育的责任

    家长对子女道德教育的责任
    从最近各地青年团组织的调查材料和报刊发表的材料来看，少数青年和少年所以沾染了浓厚的流氓习气，甚至走上腐化堕落的道路，家庭教育的不健全乃是根本原因之一。为了堵塞这个漏洞，家长们应当切实负起教育子女的责任，并运用正确的观点和方法，培养子女的共产主义道德品质。
    在我们的国家里，由于社会关系的变化，由于党对人民群众的教育，新的家庭关系正在成长。许多贤明的父母对子女的学习、生活和道德行为都十分关心，并能运用正确的观点和方法教育子女。但不是每一个家长都知道自己对子女的教育责任。一部分干部、工程技术人员和教职员，放弃了教育子女的责任，对子女的学业和道德行为不闻不问。他们认为，子女既然进入学校，教育的责任就可以完全由教师担当起来，而自己工作很忙，没有功夫教育子女。这种“养而不教”的结果是很不好的。据北京市教育局今年夏季的调查，在六十四所中等学校里面，有一百三十三名学生沾染了浓厚的流氓习气。在这些学生中，以剥削阶级家庭的子女为最多，共四十四名，其次就是干部、技术人员和教职员的子女，共三十三名。作为家长的国家工作人员对于这种情况应当给以足够的注意。
    学校在年轻一代的共产主义道德教育中负有主要责任，然而学校并不是唯一的教育机关，它必须有社会教育特别是家庭教育的配合。因为父母是儿童最初的教师，远在儿童进入学校以前，家庭教育已经给了孩子以深刻的影响，培养了孩子的某些习惯。如果家庭教育不健全，给孩子们的性格造成了一些缺陷，那无疑会给学校教育增加困难。即使在入学以后，家庭教育仍然要给孩子以深刻影响。家长始终有着不能放弃的教育子女的责任。
    至于说国家工作人员因为工作太忙，就没有时间教育子女，这不过是一种夸张的说法，或者说，只是一种借口。国家工作人员的工作确实很忙；但如果抽出一定的时间教育子女，就是比较负责的干部，那也是完全可能的。“中国青年”曾经发表过一篇“审判后的谈话”。这篇文章介绍了一位苏联工程经济学家因为“没有功夫管孩子”，而使他的独生子堕落为凶犯，被判处二十年徒刑。在宣判之后，他痛切地说：“我没有功夫管，这究竟是什么意思呢？难道我跟朋友打扑克，看足球赛，忙着建筑别墅，就有功夫吗？不是什么没有功夫，我本来可以到学校去，可以常常跟儿子详细谈谈，可是我没有这样做。”所以并不是有没有功夫的问题，而是有没有教育子女的责任感的问题，是有没有真正认识教育子女对国家前途的重要性的问题。
    许多家长对子女只是娇养溺爱，不知道教育。他们觉得子女最理想的生活，也就是最安逸的生活，并且想尽一切办法给子女安排这样的生活，无形中给孩子们灌输着好逸恶劳、贪图享受的思想。他们甚至对孩子的日常行为，完全采取放纵的态度，不论孩子们说什么，作什么，都是听之任之，有时还在教师面前掩饰孩子们的错误行为，甚至替自己的孩子的错误行为作辩护。这就助长了有些孩子不守纪律、任性胡为的坏习惯。这种对待子女的观点和方法，是资产阶级的观点和方法，在资产阶级家庭是司空见惯的；然而也有些其他阶级、甚至共产党员的家庭，受了资产阶级思想的影响，同样运用这种观点和方法教育子女。这就成为家庭教育中带有普遍性的问题。
    家长应当十分爱护子女，但娇养溺爱不是真正的爱护，只能给孩子的心理造成种种缺陷。应当处处关心子女的健康，督促和指导子女好好学习，培养子女的优良品德。特别应当注意，从小就要培养孩子们的劳动观念和劳动习惯，按照年龄特点，让孩子们从事力所能及的劳动，以便他们长大成人之后，能够成为优秀的劳动者。同时要特别注意子女的日常行为，用循循善诱、潜移默化的方法，培养孩子的共产主义道德品质。如果发现子女有什么错误行为，即使看来并不太严重的错误行为，也要及时教育纠正，而且应当注意教育方法。有些家长用粗暴的方法对待子女，子女一有错误，轻则大声叱骂，重则饱打一顿。这种方法是完全错误的，它只能妨害孩子的身心的正常发展，对纠正孩子的错误没有效果。家长们是不应该采取这种态度的。同时，家长们还应该注意自己的一言一行对于子女的重大影响，而随时检查自己。
    我国过渡时期的复杂而尖锐的阶级斗争在家庭关系上也引起了一些特殊问题。有些企图抵抗社会主义改造的资本家，为了极力争取自己的子女和他们站在一边，不惜采取一些卑污的手段，例如以大批金钱供子女挥霍，引诱子女到下流娱乐场所鬼混，使他们逐渐堕落腐化。应当警告这些作恶的资本家，他们不能够毒害自己的子女；并且向他们的子女揭穿他们的阴谋，教育这些青年和少年要看到和珍重自己的光明前途，用正确的态度对待家庭，在思想上同家庭严格地划清界限，不要被家庭所欺骗。我国家庭教育中的这一特殊问题，各地教育行政部门和青年团组织应当注意研究，并在实际工作中加以解决。
    在家庭教育方面，作为家长的国家工作人员
  （特别是党员干部）有着特别重大的责任。这不仅因为他们是家长，必须履行家长教育子女的义务；而且因为他们是国家工作人员，有责任在各个方面，当然也包括家庭教育方面，作为人民群众的榜样，并带动人民群众共同为培养年轻一代的共产主义道德品质而努力。如果党员干部，特别是比较负责的党员干部，不履行家长的义务，对子女采取错误态度，党的组织就应当对他们进行教育和批评，并责成他们改正错误。我们不能容许党员有两重性格，即只是在办公室里遵守共产主义的道德原则，而回到家里却随随便便，成为一个坏的家长。
    要加强学校和家庭的联系，使家庭教育和学校教育密切地结合起来。孩子一旦进入学校，他们的教育就要由学校和家庭共同负责。学校应当了解学生在家庭里面的表现，家庭应当了解子女在学校里面的表现。由于学校是专门的教育机关，教师具有专门的教育知识，所以学校应当积极和家长建立经常的密切的联系。给家庭以更多的帮助，运用家长会议、家庭访问的形式，在家长中间有目的地进行关于教育常识的宣传，指导家长善于运用正确的观点和方法教育子女。家长们则应当尊重学校，尊重教师，主动地访问学校，了解子女的学业和道德行为，并把子女在家庭里面的表现经常地告诉学校，给学校以积极的帮助。
    关心子女的共产主义道德教育，应当成为新社会的风气。这种风气不是自然可以形成的，它有赖于社会舆论的推动。因此，报刊应当加强这一方面的宣传，好的表扬，坏的批评，不断给家长的思想以积极的影响。为了帮助家长掌握教育子女的正确观点和方法，比较专门性的报刊，还应当适当地介绍教育子女的科学知识。目前，我国的一般家长都缺乏这种知识，因此这种宣传工作就显得更加重要。
    从组织高小和初中毕业生从事生产劳动的工作中，各地已经认识到加强家庭教育的必要，并且已经作了一些工作；在最近反对资产阶级思想腐蚀青年的斗争中，对这一问题又有了进一步的认识。应当在这种认识的基础上，根据过去的经验教训，把组织家庭教育的工作，认真地作一次检查，确定今后的工作计划，使家庭教育能够密切配合学校教育和社会教育，在年轻一代的共产主义道德教育中，发挥更大的作用。
