Sichuan Province's 110 counties in hilly and mountainous areas have completed the first batch of 60 demonstrative mountain bend ponds in the past two months. Currently, various regions are continuing their efforts to build more, and it is expected that over 10,000 mountain bend ponds will be completed throughout the province before the start of spring plowing next year, which can expand the irrigated area by 2 million mu and turn many single-season fields into double-season fields.

The construction of mountain bend ponds throughout the province began under the guidance of demonstration at each level and driving force at each level. As early as July, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department conducted a trial construction of mountain bend ponds in Xining Township, Suining County, and held a provincial water conservancy work conference on the spot to introduce experience and impart technology. When the construction of ponds began in various places, the water conservancy departments also sent more than 700 water conservancy cadres to help farmers with the planning and specific technical guidance for building mountain bend ponds. Therefore, the pond sites selected in various places are very suitable, and the quality of the completed ponds is also very good.

Mountain bend ponds are built in mountain depressions surrounded by mountains on three sides. People only need to build earth dikes on the gaps in the mountain depressions to block and store mountain torrents into ponds. When using water, the drainage hole is opened, and the pond water irrigates farmland from high to low. When there is too much floodwater, flood discharge channels can also be used to introduce the water into other ditches and rivers to prevent farmland from being flooded. Building mountain bend ponds saves labor, money, and land. For example, for general ponds built in the past, each mu of beneficiary households needed to contribute 30 workdays, and in some places, each mu of beneficiary farmland even bore a cost of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan; moreover, the dikes built for the ponds were shallow and the land area was wide, occupying a lot of land. Now, for each mountain bend pond that can irrigate 200 mu of land, each mu of beneficiary farmland needs to contribute about 10 workdays and 6,000 yuan. Compared with the general ponds that were completely excavated and carried by manpower in the past, the more than 10,000 mountain bend ponds to be built throughout the province this winter and next spring can save 40 million labor days in labor alone, and also save 8,000 mu of land for pond sites. The mobilization of the construction of mountain bend ponds in various places has been deeply welcomed by farmers.

    四川省将在春耕前修成一万多个山弯大塘
    四川省丘陵地区和部分山地的一百一十个县，在近两月内所修的第一批示范性的山弯大塘已有六十个竣工。目前各地仍在努力兴修，预期在明年春耕开始前，全省可完成山弯大塘一万多个，可扩大灌溉面积两百万亩；并能使许多一季田变两季田。
    全省兴修山弯大塘工程，是在逐级示范、层层带动之下开始的。早在七月间，省水利厅就在遂宁县西宁乡试行兴修山弯大塘，并就地召开了全省水利工作会议，介绍经验和传授技术。各地在修塘开始时，水利部门又派出七百多名水利干部，帮助农民进行修筑山弯大塘的规划工作和具体技术指导。因此，各地选择的塘址都很适宜，修好的大塘质量也很好。
    山弯大塘是修筑在三面为山所环抱的山坳处，人们只需在山坳缺口方面筑上土堤，就可将山涧洪水拦蓄成塘。用水时把放水洞打开，塘水就由高到低，灌溉农田；洪水多时还可应用溢洪道把水引入其他沟渠和河溪，防止农田受淹。修筑山弯大塘省工、省钱又省地。比如过去所修的一般塘堰，受水户每亩就需出工三十个，有的地方每亩受益农田竟负担费用五万到六万元；而且修塘扎埂，水浅地宽，占的地面很多。现在每口能灌田两百亩的山弯大塘，每亩受益农田约需出工十个，出钱六千元。全省今冬明春所兴修的一万多个山弯大塘，同过去完全用人工挖挑的一般水塘相比，单是省工一项就可节省四千万个劳动力；并且还能节省塘址土地八千亩。各地在动员兴修山弯大塘时都深受农民欢迎。
