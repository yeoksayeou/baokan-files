Xinhua News Agency, London, November 13th (TASS dispatch): According to newspaper reports: A. Chesters, the former secretary of the British Labour Party's Macclesfield local party organization, has left the Labour Party and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain.

Chesters stated to the press: "I strongly protest the increasing trend of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership making major decisions without consulting party members or disregarding their wishes; I particularly protest the fraudulent means these leaders adopted at the Scarborough Labour Party annual conference to curb forces opposing the rearmament of Germany."

    英国工党一地方组织负责人
    脱离工党加入共产党
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：报纸消息：英国工党马克尔斯菲尔德地方党组织的前书记阿·契斯特尔斯已退出工党，加入了英国共产党。
    契斯特尔斯向报界发表声明说：“我坚决抗议工党右翼领导不征求党员的意见或不顾党员的愿望而通过重大决定这种日益加剧的趋势；我特别抗议这些领导者为了在斯卡巴罗的工党年会上遏止反对重新武装德国的力量而采取的欺诈手段。”
