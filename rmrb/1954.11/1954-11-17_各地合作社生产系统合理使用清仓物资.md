The work of cooperative production systems in various regions across the country in receiving cleared inventory materials from the State Materials Reserve Bureau of the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council basically concluded at the end of October.

The receiving work began in May of this year. Twenty-nine major provinces and cities' cooperative production systems participated in the receiving. The total value of the received materials was approximately 30 billion yuan. Many of these materials were either temporarily unusable or completely unusable. However, some of the materials, after being repaired, could be used for production, especially in supporting and developing the handicraft production industry, where they would be very useful. The cleared inventory materials included power equipment, metal tools, machinery, hardware, electrical equipment, motors, telecommunications equipment, textile equipment, machine parts, chemical raw materials, medical supplies, and general merchandise.

In order to reasonably use these materials, some regions' handicraft production cooperative federations or handicraft bureaus established specialized management agencies—Technical Equipment Management Groups (now renamed Materials and Technology Supply Departments); in regions without specialized management agencies, the local offices of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the provincial and municipal handicraft production cooperative federations (or handicraft bureaus), or the production sections (departments) of supply and marketing or consumer cooperatives organized dedicated personnel to handle this work. The State Materials Reserve Bureau provided assistance.

Currently, cooperative production systems in various regions are rapidly using these materials in production. Jiangsu Province adopted a method of planning and allocating while receiving, compiling and printing a "Materials Catalog" for distribution to allocation areas. Various localities submitted plans for the required varieties based on the catalog, and the provincial federation of cooperatives reviewed and decided on the adjustment and distribution. It has been decided that the first batch of materials will be prioritized for distribution to iron and woodworking production cooperatives in eleven cities and counties, including Nanjing, Xuzhou, Jingjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Yancheng, and specific conditions have been proposed for the planned allocation of cooperatives. Tianjin scientifically classified the received materials for separate processing. Shanxi Province, based on the distribution of materials, handled the materials concentrated in Taiyuan separately; the materials stored in various locations were handled by the local handicraft production cooperative federations. Hebei Province categorized the machines before processing.

Many regions have put repaired materials into production. The Tianjin Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation repaired eighteen water pumps for flood control and drainage; the Henan Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation used the received auto parts to assemble a car worth 500 million yuan for production. Hubei Province cleared out two giant oil presses and is also devising ways to put them into production.

### 各地合作社生产系统合理使用清仓物资

    各地合作社生产系统合理使用清仓物资
    全国各地合作社生产系统接收前中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会国家物资储备局清仓物资的工作，已在十月底基本结束。
    接收工作是在今年五月间开始的。参加接收的单位，有二十九个主要省、市的合作社生产系统。接收物资的总值约为三百亿元。这批物资有很多是一时不能使用或完全不能使用的。但有部分物资加以整修后可用于生产，特别是对扶植和发展手工业生产事业方面，用处很大。清仓物资中有动力设备、金属工具、机械、五金、交电器材、电机、电讯器材、纺织设备、机器零件、化工原料、医药用品和百货等。
    为了合理地使用这批物资，有的地区的手工业生产合作社联合社或手工业管理局设立专门管理的机构——技术设备管理组（现改名物资技术供应处）；在没有设立专门管理机构的地区，由全国合作总社的各地办事处、各省、市手工业生产合作社联合社（或手工业管理局），或供销、消费联合社生产处（科），组织专人负责办理这项工作。国家物资储备局给以协助。
    现在，各地合作社生产系统正迅速地把这些物资用于生产方面。江苏省采取边接收边计划调配的办法，编印了“物资目录”分发给调配地区，各地根据目录提出所需品种的计划，由省合作总社审核后再决定调剂分配。已决定第一批物资有重点地分配给南京、徐州、靖江、常州、无锡、盐城等十一个市、县的铁业及木业生产合作社，并对计划调配的合作社提出具体的条件。天津市将接收物资科学地加以分类，分别处理。山西省根据物资分布的状况，把集中在太原市的物资分别处理；分存在各地的物资，则由当地手工业生产合作社联合社负责处理。河北省把机器加以分类后处理。
    许多地区已将经整修后的物资投入生产。天津市手工业生产合作社联合社曾将十八台水泵加以整修后用于防汛排水；河南省手工业生产合作社联合社将接收的汽车零件，装修成一辆价值五亿元的汽车，用以投入生产。湖北省清理出二台巨型榨油机，也将设法投入生产。
