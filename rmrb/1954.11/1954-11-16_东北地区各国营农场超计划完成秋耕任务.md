Northeast State-Owned Farms Exceed Planned Autumn Cultivation Tasks

    After completing the wheat harvest, the state-owned farms directly under the Northeast State-Owned Farm Bureau shifted their main efforts to autumn cultivation. The grain farms directly under the bureau mobilized more than 170 tractors. Before the ground froze, six larger-scale grain farms cultivated more than 34,000 hectares of autumn land, completing 101.5% of the autumn cultivation plan, the most autumn cultivation work completed in any year.

    The employees of the farms generally recognized the role of doing a good job in autumn cultivation for next year's bumper harvest. Therefore, in the autumn cultivation operations, they all brought their initiative into play, improved efficiency, and ensured quality. The cultivated land of the Jiusan Farm generally reached a depth of more than 23 centimeters. It was also generally connected with nail-tooth harrows to achieve simultaneous plowing and harrowing.

    The soybean harvest was approaching the freezing period. In order to promptly rush the cultivation, each farm reaped, pulled, and cultivated in a timely manner, thus completing the plowing of more than 10,000 hectares of soybean fields in a very short time.

    东北地区各国营农场超计划完成秋耕任务
    东北国营农场管理局直属各农场，在完成麦收任务以后，就以主要力量转入了秋耕作业，直属各谷物农场共出动了拖拉机一百七十余台。结冻以前，六个规模较大的谷物农场，耕秋地三万四千多公顷，完成秋耕计划的百分之一百零一点五，为历年来完成秋耕作业最多的一年。
    各农场的职工们，普遍认识到作好秋耕对明年丰产的作用。因此在秋耕作业中，都发挥积极性，提高了效率，保证了质量。九三农场耕地普遍达到了二十三公分以上的深度。并普遍联结钉齿耙，作到连耕带耙。
    大豆收割时已接近结冻期，为了及时抢耕，各场都随割、随拉、及时抢耕，因而在很短的时间内完成了万余公顷豆田耕翻任务。
