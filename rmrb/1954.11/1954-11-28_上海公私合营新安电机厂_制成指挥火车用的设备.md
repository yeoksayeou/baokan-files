    Shanghai Joint State-Private New An Electric Factory
    Manufactures Equipment for Directing Trains
    On November 19th, the Shanghai Joint State-Private New An Electric Factory successfully trial-produced a "track selection type relay interlocking console" for directing trains entering and leaving stations. This control equipment is fully automated and electrified. It is equipped with a miniaturized railway distribution map of the jurisdiction. After installing this control equipment, only one person is needed to operate it to direct vehicles into and out of the station as desired. In the past, many people were busy waiting for trains to enter and leave the station, having to change traffic lights, switch tracks, and wave red and green flags. Sometimes, a slight oversight could easily cause accidents. Now, with this control equipment, as soon as the button is pressed, different colors immediately appear on the railway distribution map. These different colors indicate where the train is traveling or where it is stopped. Seeing this, the operator can press another button to switch tracks or change signals, directing the train to enter or leave the station along that track. In this way, one person can replace the intense work of more than a hundred people in the past. On the 20th, this control equipment was shipped in its entirety and will soon be installed at a large railway station in the south to direct vehicles.

    上海公私合营新安电机厂
    制成指挥火车用的设备
    上海公私合营新安电机厂在十一月十九日，已经把指挥火车进出站用的“进出选路式继电联锁控制台”试制成功。这台控制设备，全部都是自动化电气化的。它上面装置有缩小了的辖区内铁路分布图。把这台控制设备安装起来，只要一个人操作，就可以如意地指挥车辆进出车站。过去在车站上为了等候火车进出站，需要许多人忙个不休，又要变换红绿灯，又要分轨、又要打红绿旗，有时稍一疏忽还很容易造成事故。现在有了这台控制设备，只要按动电钮，铁路分布图上立即有不同的颜色出现，这些不同的颜色，表示火车行进到什么地方或停在什么地方。看到了这些，操纵的人就可按动另一只电钮，进行分轨或变换信号，指挥火车顺那一条轨道进站或出站。这样一个人就可代替过去一百多个人的紧张工作。二十日，这台控制设备已全部启运，不久就可以安装在南方的一个大火车站上指挥车辆了。
