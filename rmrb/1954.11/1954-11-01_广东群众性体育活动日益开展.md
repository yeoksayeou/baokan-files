    Mass sports activities in Guangdong Province are becoming more and more active.
    Ball games such as basketball, football, and volleyball are increasingly popular among workers, farmers, and students in Guangdong Province. In just a few counties like Zhongshan, Xinhui, Taishan, and Meixian, there are more than 1,200 basketball, football, and volleyball teams. Mass ball game competitions are very active in factories and rural areas. On June 20th of this year alone, more than 140 teams in 16 locations across the province held football matches. Baijiao Township in the Eighth District of Zhongshan County and Shenwan Township in the Second District held two basketball competitions in July and September this year, with more than 150 basketball teams participating. In the province, more than 60% of the employees in 33 factories and mines regularly participate in sports activities. Among middle school students, more than 1,900 sports training groups have been organized, and the students are achieving very good results in their training. Water sports are the most popular activities for the people of Guangdong Province, and they are especially active in the Pearl River Delta region. In Xiaoyin Township, Zhongshan County, hundreds of people practice swimming techniques in the river every day. This year, new swimming pools have been built in Shantou, Chaozhou, Foshan, Shiqi, and Jiangmen. The four swimming pools in Guangzhou City have all been renovated this year, and in these four swimming pools alone, 960,000 people visited for swimming from May to August this year.
