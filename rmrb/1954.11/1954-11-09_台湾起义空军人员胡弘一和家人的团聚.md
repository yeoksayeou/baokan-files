    Hu Hongyi's mother, Hu Jiangui, is a worker at the Hangzhou Welfare Tea Factory. On the morning of October 30th, Hu Jiangui was washing clothes when an old fellow villager, Wang Ren'an, excitedly ran over to her and said, "Your son is back! The newspaper published news that he flew an airplane from Taiwan in an uprising and returned to the motherland." At that time, Hu Jiangui really couldn't believe her ears. She thought: Is this true? At noon, her youngest daughter, Hu Shuqian, who was studying at Hangzhou No. 1 Middle School, returned home and also told her that Hu Hongyi had returned. The mother and daughter were so happy that they didn't even want to eat.

    Hu Jiangui will never forget the situation in which her son was deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In early 1949, Hu Hongyi was studying at Tsinghua Middle School. His father had been ill in bed for two years, and the family was making a living by selling things. In this difficult situation, Chiang Kai-shek's kidnapping of young people to join the reactionary navy occurred, and Hu Hongyi was deceived. Hu Jiangui said, "I shed so many tears for this child at that time. He sent a letter from Taiwan, saying that on the warship from Shanghai to Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek gave them thin porridge with a kerosene smell, and he vomited as soon as he ate it. My heart ached when I found out! Day and night, I hoped that this child could return to my side and do something for the people." After the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan was issued by various democratic parties and people's organizations, Hu Jiangui couldn't restrain herself in any way, and she thought a lot. She knew that the government's policy was: except for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, anyone is allowed to abandon the dark and turn to the light, return to the mainland and reunite with their families, and anyone can receive lenient treatment for meritorious service, redemption of sins, and no past offenses being held against them. She hoped that her son in Taiwan could hear these words and resolutely return to the motherland and his hometown. Now Hu Jiangui's hope has finally become a reality, and her son has flown an airplane from Taiwan in an uprising and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

    On the evening of the 30th, her eldest daughter, Hu Shujuan, who teaches at Liangxian Elementary School in Hangzhou City, ran across half of Hangzhou to see her mother. Although she was already in her thirties, she was so excited by her younger brother Hu Hongyi's patriotic actions that she couldn't control herself. She ran into the house jumping and running. Hu Jiangui excitedly said to her eldest daughter, "Hongyi was able to fly an airplane back to the mainland, which shows that he has patriotic ideas. After Hongyi returns to the mainland, he should serve the people well and do more work." She looked at her eldest daughter, paused, and then said, "But there are still many people like Hongyi who have been deceived by Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. As parents, who doesn't want their sons to come back and reunite? I hope they can all take the path of Hongyi."

    On the morning of November 6th, the local people's government informed Hu Jiangui that her son Hu Hongyi would be returning to Hangzhou from Fujian today. Hu Jiangui couldn't stop smiling when she heard this news. That afternoon, Hu Hongyi arrived by car, and the whole family opened their arms and hugged him tightly, everyone shedding tears of joy. Hu Jiangui said to her son, "Child, you don't know how many tears I shed for you, hoping you would come back day and night; if you didn't come back, I wouldn't be able to close my eyes even when I died!" Hu Hongyi was also very moved when he saw the happy and fulfilling life at home. That day, their whole family was immersed in joy, chatting until late at night.

    台湾起义空军人员胡弘一和家人的团聚
    新华社记者  陈森
    胡弘一的母亲叫胡江圭，是杭州福利茶厂的工人。十月三十日上午，胡江圭正在洗衣服，老同乡汪仁安喜冲冲地跑来对她说：“你的儿子回来了，报纸上登了他驾着一架飞机从台湾起义回到祖国的消息。”当时胡江圭真有点不大相信自己的耳朵，她想：这是真的吗？中午，在杭州市第一中学读书的小女儿胡淑谦回到家里也告诉她说胡弘一回来了。母女俩高兴得连吃饭也不想吃了。
    胡江圭永远忘不了自己的儿子被蒋介石卖国集团骗走的情形。一九四九年初，胡弘一在清华中学读书，他父亲害病躺在床上已经两年，家里靠着变卖东西度日。就在这种困难的情况下，遇上蒋介石拐骗青年参加反动海军，胡弘一就受骗了。胡江圭说：“为了这个孩子，当时我流了多少泪啊。他到台湾曾来过一封信，说在从上海到台湾的兵舰上，蒋介石给他们吃的是带有煤油气味的薄粥，他一吃就吐。我知道了心好酸呀！日日夜夜盼望着这孩子能回到我的身边，为人民做些事情。”当各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言发表以后，胡江圭无论如何克制不住自己，她想得很多。她知道政府的政策是：除蒋贼一人而外，任何人都容许弃暗投明，回到大陆和家人团聚，任何人都可以受到立功赎罪、既往不咎的宽大待遇。她希望在台湾的儿子能够听到这么一段话，毅然回到祖国和自己的家乡来。现在胡江圭的希望终于变成了事实，她的儿子从台湾驾着一架飞机起义回到了祖国的怀抱。
    三十日黄昏，在杭州市两岘小学教书的大女儿胡淑?穿过半个杭州城跑来见母亲。虽然她已是三十多岁的人了，但她为弟弟胡弘一的爱国行动激动得没法控制，她是连跳带跑冲进屋子来的。胡江圭兴奋地对她大女儿说：“弘一能够架着飞机回到祖国大陆，说明他有爱国思想。弘一回到大陆以后，就应该好好地为人民服务，多做些工作。”她看着大女儿，停了一停，又说：“可是还有很多像弘一那样的人被蒋介石骗在台湾，做父母的人，谁不希望自己的儿子回来团聚，我希望他们都能走弘一的路。”
    十一月六日早晨，当地人民政府通知胡江圭，说她的儿子胡弘一今天就要从福建回到杭州来了。胡江圭听到这消息，笑的合不拢嘴来。这天下午，胡弘一乘着汽车来到了，全家人一齐张开了臂膀，把他紧紧地抱了起来，个个都欢喜得流下了热泪。胡江圭对儿子说：“孩子，你不知道我为你流了多少眼泪，日夜盼望你回来；要是你不回来，我死了也不能阖眼呀！”胡弘一看到家里幸福、美满的生活，心中也很感动。这一天，他们全家沉浸在欢乐里，一直畅谈到深夜。
