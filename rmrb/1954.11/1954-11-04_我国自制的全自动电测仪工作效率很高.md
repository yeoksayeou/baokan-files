China's first self-made fully automatic downhole electrical logging instrument has been successfully tested.

Trial use of this self-made fully automatic downhole electrical logging instrument has proven that its work quality not only meets Soviet standards, but also its efficiency is very high. Each time a cable is lowered into a test well, five resistivity curves can be measured, and only two cable runs are needed to complete the logging of a well. In contrast, with the original downhole electrical logging instruments, only two curves could be measured, requiring seven cable runs.

The fully automatic downhole electrical logging instrument was successfully manufactured by Liu Yongnian, an engineer from the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Drilling Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, and other engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers over a period of more than three years. They mainly referred to the structure of the latest Soviet electrical logging instruments for design, and also demonstrated creativity and overcame many difficulties in the manufacturing process. When this set of instruments was manufactured and transported to the Jiuquan Basin for testing, some shortcomings were continuously corrected, and finally it passed the test in mid-September of this year.

Downhole electrical logging instruments are an indispensable and highly precise instrument in petroleum exploration. Whenever an oil exploration well is drilled, a cable connected to this set of instruments is lowered into the well to understand the relevant conditions inside the well. The various curves obtained after electrical logging can indicate the size of the well diameter, the depth of the well bottom, the downhole temperature, and the location of oil and water layers. Therefore, people call it "the eyes of petroleum geologists." (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国自制的全自动电测仪工作效率很高
    我国自制的第一部全自动井下电测仪已经试用成功。
    我国自制的这部全自动井下电测仪经过试用证明，不但工作质量达到了苏联标准，而且效率也很高。每往探井里下一次电缆，可以测量出五条电阻系数曲线，每测一口井只要起下两次电缆就行了；而用原有的井下电测仪器，只能测出两条曲线，要起下七次电缆。
    全自动井下电测仪是由燃料工业部石油管理总局钻探局工程师刘永年和其他工程技术人员、技术工人经过三年多时间制造成功的。他们主要参照苏联最新式的电测仪器的结构来设计，在制造过程中又发挥了创造精神，克服了不少困难。当这套仪器制成运到酒泉盆地试验时，又不断地改正了一些缺点，最后在今年九月中旬试验合格。
    井下电测仪是石油钻探工作中不可缺少的一种非常精密的仪器，每当钻成一口石油探井时，就要把和这套仪器通联的电缆下到井里，来了解井里的有关情况。经电测后得出的各种曲线，能说明井径的大小，井底深度、井下温度、油层和水层位置等情况。所以人们都称它是“石油地质工作者的眼睛。”　（新华社）
