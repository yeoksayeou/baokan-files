    Ministry of Commerce Makes Decision
    Changing Regulations on Staggered Use of Cloth Ration Coupons
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China has decided to change the regulation on the use of cloth ration coupons in two installments for the first coupon year (September 1954 to August 1955). From November 20th, all regions across the country that have already issued the second installment of cloth ration coupons can use them in advance. This means that the two installments of cloth ration coupons issued for the first coupon year can be used at any time from November 20th to the end of August next year. For areas that have not yet printed and issued the second installment of cloth ration coupons, the Ministry of Commerce has instructed the local departments concerned to print and issue them as soon as possible, in order to facilitate people's more planned use of the annual quota of cotton cloth.

    商业部作出决定
    改变购布证分期使用的规定
    【新华社十九日讯】中华人民共和国商业部决定改变购布证第一发票年度（一九五四年九月到一九五五年八月）分两期使用的规定。自十一月二十日起，全国各地凡已有第二期购布证者可以提前使用。这就是说，第一发票年度所发的两期购布证，自十一月二十日起到明年八月底以前，随时都可使用。现在还没有印发第二期购布证的地区，商业部已责成当地有关部门尽快印发，以便利人民更有计划地使用全年定量的棉布。
