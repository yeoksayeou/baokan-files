Observing Victory Through the Observation Mirror
Ma Zhenhua

In the first few days of November, the artillery observation post of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on a certain island at the Zhejiang coastal defense front was crowded with young observers from morning till night. From their observation mirrors, they excitedly observed the chaotic state of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Dachen Island and Yijiangshan Island under the joint attack of our People's Air Force and artillery.

On clear days, observers from this island could clearly see the winding trenches and the activities of the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island. Before being subjected to the joint attacks of our People's Air Force and artillery, Chiang's bandit soldiers were building roads and bunkers on Dachen Island, and cars were running back and forth. At night, one could see the scattered lights from the island. On Sundays, one could even see Chiang’s bandit soldiers washing clothes in the gullies. Chiang’s bandit warships also frequently operated around the island and constantly shelled and harassed our coastal islands and mainland in Zhejiang, robbing fishing boats and merchant ships at sea. But now, all this has become a thing of the past.

On the morning of November 1st, the skies over Zhejiang were clear for thousands of miles, and the sunlight shone on the sea, glittering with dazzling gold. Observer Lin Shengtai looked at Dachen Island through his observation mirror, and saw that Chiang’s bandit soldiers and cars were still moving around as usual, and an ugly Kuomintang flag was also shaking slightly on the flagpole.

At a little after eleven o'clock, the roar of engines came from the air, and squadrons of our People's Air Force bravely flew over Dachen Island. In an instant, towering columns of smoke rose from the positions of the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island, followed by deafening, continuous loud noises—the large number of bombs dropped by the war eagles of our People's Air Force exploded on the positions of Chiang's bandit troops.

At this time, Dachen Island, as seen through the observation mirror, was in complete chaos everywhere. A car was blown over on the road, several Chiang bandit warships, which were originally anchored in the sea off Dachen Island, fled in panic in all directions. After the Chiang bandit military command on Dachen Island was hit, the building caught fire, and black smoke filled the sky over Dachen Island. The Chiang bandit troops carrying the wounded were as flustered as ants whose nests had been dug up. Even the Kuomintang flag on the hillside was blown away without a trace.

At 16:22 on the same day, more than four hours after our People's Air Force bombed Dachen Island, the Chiang bandit barracks on Dachen Island that had been hit were still smoking. At this time, a Chiang bandit seaplane flew in from the south of Dachen Island. As soon as this Chiang bandit plane reached the airspace above Dachen Island, it hurriedly lowered its altitude, preparing to land. However, the Yong-class and Tai-class warships of the Chiang bandits, whose souls had been scattered by the bombing of our People's Air Force, were frightened out of their wits by this Chiang bandit plane. As soon as they heard the sound of the plane, they hurriedly started their engines, fleeing towards the outer sea while firing at the Chiang bandit plane. One Yong-class warship was so panicked that it even fired its main guns at the sky. The Chiang bandit seaplane was hit and hurriedly increased its altitude, helplessly hiding in the high altitude. It was not until the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island sent out a signal that these Chiang bandit warships, which had been firing in panic for twelve minutes, stopped firing.

The farce of self-disturbance by the Chiang bandit navy and air force had just ended when the cannons on a certain island of our People's Liberation Army were aimed at the positions of the Chiang bandit troops on Yijiangshan Island and bombarded them. Our observers skillfully rotated the observation mirrors, and saw a large number of shells continuously exploding on the positions of the Chiang bandit troops on Yijiangshan Island. The thick smoke from the artillery fire enveloped the entire Yijiangshan Island. A Chiang bandit Yong-class warship patrolling near Yijiangshan Island hurriedly turned around, firing sporadically at us while fleeing. Many of the shells fired in a panic by this Chiang bandit warship did not even fly over Yijiangshan Island, which was occupied by the Chiang bandit troops, and exploded in the sea.

After being subjected to the joint attacks of our People's Air Force and artillery, our military observers looked through the observation mirrors from morning to night, but all they could see was: Dachen Island, Yijiangshan Island and other islands had become a dead zone. The roads were empty, without cars or pedestrians. The Chiang bandit soldiers dared not come out to build roads or bunkers. Even the gully where Chiang bandit soldiers used to wash clothes could not see a single person. The Chiang bandit warships were hiding far away in the sea south of Dachen Island and dared not moor together as they had done before. On November 3rd, a Chiang bandit warship boldly returned to the vicinity of Dachen Island, but was still uneasy and changed its anchoring position four times in one day. Some Chiang bandit warships simply dared not show their faces during the day. At night, Dachen Island was even darker, without lights or the signal lights that were often emitted in the past.

The observers of our People's Liberation Army excitedly observed the glorious victory of the joint attack of our People's Air Force and artillery on the Chiang bandit troops through the observation mirrors, and could not restrain their excitement, saying: "This is just the beginning of victory, and even more glorious and greater victories are yet to come!"

    观察镜里看胜利
    马真划
    十一月开头这几天，浙江海防前哨某岛上的中国人民解放军某炮兵观察所里，从早到晚都挤满了年青的观察员们，他们从观察镜里兴奋地观察着大陈岛和一江山岛上蒋贼军受到我人民空军和炮兵的联合打击的狼狈相。
    在天晴的时候，从这个岛上观察员们能够清楚地看见大陈岛上弯弯曲曲的战壕和蒋贼军的活动。在受到我人民空军和炮兵联合打击以前，蒋贼军士兵在大陈岛上修公路，盖地堡，汽车来往地跑着。晚上，可以看到从岛上发出来的点点灯光。星期天，还可以看到蒋贼军士兵在山沟里洗衣服。蒋贼军的舰艇也经常在岛周围活动，并不断地向我浙江沿海岛屿和大陆进行炮击、骚扰，抢劫在海上的渔船和商船。但是现在，这一切都已成为过去了。
    十一月一日上午，浙江海空万里无云，阳光照射在海面上，泛着耀眼的金光。观察员林声泰从观察镜里向大陈岛上望去，只见蒋贼军士兵和汽车仍然和往常一样地来往活动着，有一面丑恶的国民党旗，也在旗杆上微微地抖动着。
    十一点多钟，空中传来了隆隆的马达声，我人民空军的一队队的机群英勇地飞到了大陈岛的上空。顷刻间，大陈岛蒋贼军阵地上腾起了冲天的烟柱，接着就传来了震耳的连续的巨响——我人民空军的战鹰们投下的大量炸弹，都在蒋贼军的阵地上爆炸了。
    这时，出现在观察镜里的大陈岛，到处一片混乱。一辆汽车被炸歪在公路上，几艘原来停泊在大陈岛海面的蒋贼军舰慌乱地东逃西窜，大陈岛上蒋贼军指挥机关中弹以后，房子烧起了大火，黑烟在大陈岛上空弥漫，抬运伤兵的蒋贼军慌乱得就像被掘了窝的蚂蚁一样，在半山坡上的那面国民党旗也被炸得连踪影都看不见了。
    当天十六时二十二分，我人民空军轰炸大陈岛后已经四个多小时了，大陈岛上被炸中的蒋贼军营房还在冒着烟。这时，从大陈岛南面飞来一架蒋贼军的水上飞机，这架蒋贼军飞机一到大陈岛上空，就急忙降低高度，准备降落。但是，被我人民空军轰炸得惊魂未定的蒋贼军永字号和太字号军舰，却被这架蒋贼飞机吓破了胆，一听见飞机声，它们就连忙发动了机器，一面向外海里逃，一面向这架蒋贼飞机开炮射击，有一艘永字号军舰慌得连主炮也对天上射击起来了。那架蒋贼军的水上飞机被打得连忙升高了高度，无可奈何地躲到高空里去。直到大陈岛上蒋贼军发出信号之后，这些恐慌地射击了十二分钟的蒋贼军舰才停止了射击。
    蒋贼海、空军这场自相惊扰的丑剧刚刚结束，我人民解放军某岛上的大炮又对准蒋贼军一江山岛上的阵地轰击了，我军观察员们伶巧地转动着观察镜，只见大量的炮弹连续在一江山岛蒋贼军阵地上爆炸着，炮火掀起的浓烟笼罩了整个一江山岛。正在一江山岛附近巡逻的一艘蒋贼军永字号军舰慌忙调回头，一面逃跑，一面零乱地向我打炮。这艘蒋贼军舰慌慌张张地打出的很多炮弹甚至没有飞过蒋贼军盘踞的一江山岛，就落在海水里爆炸了。
    受到我人民空军和炮兵的联合打击以后，我军观察员们在观察镜上从早晨看到晚上，但是，所能看到的是：大陈岛、一江山岛等岛屿上都变得一片死寂，公路上空荡荡的，没有汽车，也没有行人，蒋贼军士兵不敢出来修公路、盖地堡，就连以前蒋贼军士兵洗衣服的那条山沟里，也看不到半个人影了。蒋贼军的舰艇都老远老远地躲在大陈岛以南的海面上而且也不敢像以前那样挤在一起停泊了。十一月三日，有一艘蒋贼军军舰放大胆子回到大陈岛附近，但还是惶惶不安地在一天当中竟换了四个停泊的位置。有几艘蒋贼军舰索性不敢在白天露面了。一到夜间，大陈岛上更是一片漆黑，不见灯火，也不见昔日经常发出的信号灯光了。
    我人民解放军的观察员们从观察镜里兴奋地观察着我人民空军和炮兵联合打击蒋贼军的光辉胜利，都抑制不住激动的心情说：“这只不过是胜利的开始，更光辉更伟大的胜利还在后面呢！”
