    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 29th: According to TASS, the Presidium of the Polish Academy of Sciences sent a telegram to the scientists of the French Academy of Sciences, calling on them to oppose the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. The telegram said: The rearmament of revanchist German forces is fraught with the danger of a new war breaking out. This danger will first threaten our nation, our culture, our scientific institutions, and our creative scientific work.
    The telegram said: We do not want to fight Germany, but we also do not want Germany to fight France or our country. No one understands the great significance of the peaceful and creative cooperation of all countries in developing science and in seeking the welfare and happiness of mankind better than we do. We are convinced that it is not too late to take measures to stop the developments related to West Germany's remilitarization. The path to peace lies in the conclusion of an all-European agreement guaranteeing collective security. We believe that you, together with the patriotic forces of the French people, will raise your powerful voice against the threat of German remilitarization and against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements.

    波兰科学家呼吁法国科学家反对巴黎协定
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社华沙二十八日讯：波兰科学院主席团拍电报给法国科学院的科学家们，呼吁他们反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定。电报说：复仇主义的德国部队的重新武装充满了爆发新战争的危险。这种危险将首先威胁到我们的民族、我们的文化、我们的科学机关和我们的创造性的科学工作。
    电报说：我们不希望打德国，但是我们也不希望德国来打法国或者打我国。没有人比我们更清楚地了解各国为发展科学，为谋取人类的福利和幸福而进行创造性的和平合作的伟大意义。我们确信，现在采取措施来制止和西德重新军国主义化有关的事态发展还不算太晚。和平的道路在于缔结一项保障集体安全的全欧协定。我们相信，你们将同法国人民的爱国力量一起，发出你们强有力的呼声，反对德国重新军国主义化的威胁，反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定。
