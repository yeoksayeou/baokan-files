    Shanxi Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Supplies Materials to Cooperate with Unified Purchase Work
    To cooperate with the state's unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and to meet the needs of the rapid development of agricultural producers' cooperatives after the autumn harvest, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province are vigorously supplying rural production materials and daily necessities. The third provincial cooperative representatives' conference held in July this year specifically studied and arranged for the material supply work in the second half of this year. After the meeting, in addition to closely cooperating with the agricultural production increase movement and actively carrying out autumn material supply work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions also vigorously prepared winter supply materials. At present, the winter supply materials already in the hands of the Shanxi Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative system are worth more than 1.3 trillion yuan.
    This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province have paid special attention to strengthening the supply of production materials. In July and August, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent purchasing personnel to Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and other places to purchase livestock, and to Tianjin and other places to purchase farm tools and pesticides. Based on the principle of "obtaining materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally," the grassroots cooperatives also organized local blacksmiths, carpenters, oil pressing workshops, and other handicraft workers to manufacture small farm tools and press cake fertilizer. Currently, the production materials already in the hands of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions include 360,000 dan of various cake fertilizers, more than 17,000 head of livestock, various small farm tools worth more than 13 billion yuan, and many other chemical fertilizers and other production materials.
    When supplying materials, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Shanxi Province adopted various methods such as organizing small material exchange meetings and signing supply contracts with organized farmers. Jieyu, Hongzhao, and other counties recently held material exchange meetings. The material exchange meeting held in Jieyu County in early October was attended by eleven grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and the total value of transactions in ten days reached more than 1.47 billion yuan. In some areas of Pinglu and other counties, the business departments have been expanded and sales booths have been added according to actual needs.

    山西省供销合作社供应物资配合统购工作
    配合国家统购粮食、棉花和油料的工作，适应秋后农业生产合作社大发展的需要，山西省各地供销合作社大力供应农村生产资料和生活资料。今年七月间举行的全省第三届合作社代表会议，就对今年下半年的物资供应工作作了具体的研究和安排。会后，各地供销合作社除紧密配合农业增产运动，积极进行了秋季物资供应工作外，还大力准备了冬季供应物资。目前，山西省供销合作社系统已经掌握的冬季供应物资，共值一万三千多亿元。
    山西省各地供销合作社今年特别注意加强了生产资料的供应工作。七、八月间，山西省供销合作社就派采购人员分别到甘肃、内蒙古等地购买牲畜，到天津等地购买农具、农药；各基层合作社也本着“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的原则，组织本地铁匠炉、木匠铺、榨油作坊等手工业者打造小型农具和榨制饼肥。现在各地供销合作社已经掌握的生产资料中，有各种饼肥三十六万市担、牲畜一万七千多头，有价值一百三十多亿元的各种小型农具，还有许多化学肥料等其他的生产资料。
    山西省各地供销合作社在供应物资时，采取了组织小型物资交流会、同组织起来的农民签订供应合同等多种方式。解虞、洪赵等县最近都召开了物资交流会。解虞县十月上旬举行的物资交流会，有十一个基层供销合作社参加，十天成交总值达十四亿七千多万元。平陆等县有些地区还根据实际需要，扩大了门市部，增设了售货摊。
