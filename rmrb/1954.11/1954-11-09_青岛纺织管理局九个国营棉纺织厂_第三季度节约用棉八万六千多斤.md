    Qingdao Textile Bureau's Nine State-Owned Cotton Textile Factories
    Save More Than 86,000 Jin of Cotton in the Third Quarter
    [From Our Own Correspondent] The nine state-owned cotton textile factories under the Qingdao Textile Bureau saved more than 86,000 jin of cotton in the total cotton consumption for major cotton yarn production in the third quarter compared to the original plan, and more than 60,000 jin compared to the actual cotton consumption in the second quarter. If the 86,000 jin of cotton were woven into cloth, it could provide more than 50,000 people with a set of clothes each.
    According to the production characteristics of the third quarter, the employees of various factories under the Qingdao Textile Bureau adopted measures to save cotton: such as strictly controlling workshop temperature, adjusting the mechanical equipment of opening and carding, strengthening the recycling of return flowers and cotton waste, promoting quota management of raw cotton, conscientiously implementing various working methods, and reducing yarn breakage, etc., basically reversing the situation of overspending cotton in the third quarter of previous years, and achieved greater results. When a large amount of inferior cotton began to be used in July, the unified cotton consumption increased by 0.43% compared to June, but after various factories conducted various experiments and research, and took appropriate measures, starting from August, the unified cotton consumption decreased by 0.52% compared to July, and slightly decreased compared to June. In September, due to the better quality of cotton, the unified cotton consumption decreased by another 0.49% compared to August. Comparing September with June, more than 66,000 jin of cotton were saved in one month. At present, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, various factories are vigorously carrying out the work of saving cotton on the premise of ensuring improved quality, and strive to achieve greater results in saving cotton in the fourth quarter.

    青岛纺织管理局九个国营棉纺织厂
    第三季度节约用棉八万六千多斤
    【本报讯】青岛纺织管理局所属九个国营棉纺织厂，第三季度主要棉纱生产的总用棉量，比原订计划节约了八万六千多斤，比第二季度实际用棉量节约了六万多斤。如果把八万六千多斤的棉花织成布，可供五万多人每人做一套衣服。
    青岛纺织管理局各厂职工根据第三季度生产的特点，采取了节约用棉的措施：如严格地掌握车间温度，调整清花和梳棉的机械设备，加强回花落棉的回收工作，推行了原棉定额管理，认真执行各种工作法，减少断头等，基本上扭转了往年第三季度用棉超支的情况，获得了较大的成绩。在七月份开始大量用较差的棉花时，统扯用棉量曾比六月份增加了百分之零点四三，但经过各厂做了各种试验研究，采取了适当的措施后，从八月份开始，统扯用棉量比七月份降低了百分之零点五二，比六月份也略有降低。九月份因棉花质量较好，统扯用棉量又比八月份降低了百分之零点四九。如以九月份和六月份对比，一个月就节约了六万六千多斤棉花。目前，各厂正根据增产节约的精神，在保证提高质量的前提下，大力开展节约用棉的工作，争取第四季度在节约用棉方面取得更大的成绩。
