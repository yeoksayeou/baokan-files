Guangdong Province to Massively Promote New Farm Tools Next Year

The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture held a New Farm Tool Work Conference in late October, deciding to promote 40,000 units of the "May 1st" plow and "May 3rd" plow next year, 1,000 units of double-wheeled double-furrow plows in the plains and drylands, 7,000 rice threshers, and 45,000 sets of paddy field cultivators.

Guangdong Province's promotion of new farm tools began in 1951 with key pilot demonstration work. By the end of September this year, according to incomplete statistics, the province had promoted a total of 2,115 units of "May 1st" paddy field plows and seven-inch walking plows, 60 double-wheeled double-furrow plows, and more than 1,300 rice threshers. These new farm tools have been proven to be superior to old-fashioned farm tools through trials in various places. The "May 1st" paddy field plow can plow one to one and a half inches deeper than the old-fashioned plow, and the work efficiency can be increased by more than 20%. The double-wheeled double-furrow plow is about twice as efficient as the old-fashioned plow when used in dryland. The Wang Hanguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyang County conducted a comparative test of the "May 1st" paddy field plow and the old-fashioned plow on the same field with the same cultivation method for early rice this year. The results showed that the field plowed with the "May 1st" plow yielded 11.3% more per mu than the old-fashioned plow. The "May 1st" plow has been tested on different soils in various places, and the effect is very good. Farmers generally welcome it.

The promotion of new farm tools in various places is first carried out in state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives for pilot demonstrations. During the spring plowing this year, the Yangcun Farm in Boluo County conducted new plow plowing performances for more than 40,000 farmers. In Meixian County, the leading use of the "May 1st" paddy field plow by the farm has led the first batch of newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the county to also use it. Under the leadership of the first agricultural production cooperative in Gutang Township, Meixian County, four mutual aid teams have now also purchased the "May 1st" plow for use.

### 广东省将在明年大量推广新式农具

    广东省将在明年大量推广新式农具
    广东省农业厅在十月下旬召开了新式农具工作会议，决定明年推广“五一”犁和“五三”犁四万部，在平原旱地推广双轮双铧犁一千部，打禾机七千架，水田中耕器四万五千具。
    广东省的新式农具推广工作，从一九五一年就开始进行重点试验示范工作，到今年九月底止，据不完全统计，全省共推广“五一”水田犁和七寸步犁等二千一百一十五部，双轮双铧犁六十部，打禾机一千三百多架。这些新式农具经各地试验证明都比旧式农具优越。“五一”水田犁比旧式犁能深耕一寸到一寸半，工作效率可提高百分之二十以上。双轮双铧犁在旱地使用比旧式犁效率提高二倍左右。揭阳县汪汉国农业生产合作社，今年早稻在同一块田以同样的栽培方法，进行“五一”水田犁与旧式犁比较试验，结果“五一”犁耕的田每亩产量比旧式犁增产百分之十一点三。各地在不同土壤上试用“五一”犁，效果都很好，农民普遍欢迎。
    各地推广新式农具，均首先在国营农场和农业生产合作社进行试验示范。博罗县杨村农场在今年春耕时曾先后向四万多农民群众进行新犁犁地表演。梅县由于农场带头使用“五一”水田犁，带动了该县今年新建立的第一批农业生产合作社也使用了。该县古塘乡在该乡第一农业生产合作社的带动下，现在已有四个互助组也买“五一”犁使用。  （本报广东记者站）
