Xinjiang Province has seen significant development in the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. As of the end of September, 129 agricultural production cooperatives had been established throughout the province, exceeding the original planned number of cooperatives by more than 57 percent. Adding the original ten older cooperatives, there are a total of 139 agricultural production cooperatives.

This year, the establishment of cooperatives in Xinjiang was carried out under the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels. Before establishing the cooperatives, all regions actively carried out preparatory work for establishing cooperatives based on the instructions of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and trained a large number of cadres for establishing cooperatives. During the establishment of cooperatives, all regions widely publicized the Party's general line for the transition period and the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, raised the socialist awareness of the masses, and mobilized the masses to voluntarily join the cooperatives. At the same time, in areas with mixed ethnic groups, special attention was paid to implementing the policy of ethnic unity and taking care of the customs and habits of various ethnic groups when carrying out the work of establishing cooperatives. When dealing with specific issues, in accordance with the principles of both benefiting the growth of socialist factors and increasing the actual income of cooperative members, and benefiting ethnic unity, the members were mobilized to conduct serious discussions and then made reasonable arrangements, thereby further strengthening ethnic unity.

The agricultural production cooperatives established in Xinjiang have, to varying degrees, demonstrated their superiority in production, consolidated the confidence of the members in joining the cooperatives, stimulated the enthusiasm of nearby farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and promoted the development of mutual aid groups. Many agricultural production cooperatives have become the centers of the local mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of farming techniques, setting an example for farmers of all ethnic groups to take the road of collectivization.

At present, various meetings on mutual aid and cooperation are being held in various places to systematically summarize experience, train cadres, and formulate plans for establishing cooperatives in preparation for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

    新疆省秋前建立一百多个农业生产合作社
    新疆各地建立农业生产合作社的工作有了显著发展。截至九月底为止，全省已建立了一百二十九个农业生产合作社，超过原订建社计划百分之五十七强。加上原有的十个老社，共有农业生产合作社一百三十九个。
    今年，新疆各地的建社工作，是在各级党委坚强的领导下进行的。建社前，各地都根据中共中央新疆分局的指示，积极地进行了建社准备工作，训练了大批建社干部。建社中，各地普遍地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线和互助合作政策，提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，发动群众自觉自愿地入社。同时，在民族杂居的地区，进行建社工作时，都特别注意了贯彻民族团结政策，照顾各民族风俗习惯；在处理各项具体问题时，按照既有利于社会主义因素增长、社员实际收入增加，又有利于民族团结的原则，发动社员认真地进行了讨论以后，作了合理的处理，从而进一步加强了民族团结。
    新疆各地建立的农业生产合作社，在生产中，已不同程度地显示出了它的优越性，巩固了社员的入社信心，激发了附近农民参加互助合作的积极性，带动了互助组的发展。许多农业生产合作社已成为当地互助合作运动和改进耕作技术的中心，给各族农民树立了走合作化道路的榜样。
    目前，各地正在召开有关互助合作的各种会议，系统地总结经验，培养干部，制订建社计划，为秋后建社进行准备工作。
