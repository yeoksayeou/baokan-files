Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Washington News: The American aggression clique is attempting to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan with war threats. This sinister plan has been openly exposed by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on the 16th. Dulles said at a press conference that day: if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, it may cause "hostile actions with the United States." Dulles indicated that the United States might expand the scope of aggression and take action to shelter the Dachen Islands, where Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops are entrenched along the Zhejiang coast. He said that although the Dachen Islands are not considered part of Taiwan, "it can be considered as included in the defense of Taiwan." Dulles also stated that negotiations between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on the so-called "mutual defense treaty" are being accelerated. Dulles's continuous issuance of such provocative clamors, attempting to threaten the Chinese people, fully exposes the ferocious face of the American aggression clique, which disregards the righteous condemnation of world public opinion and is determined to forcibly occupy China's territory of Taiwan as its base of aggression.
    In order to cover up the illegal act of the United States' forcible occupation of Chinese territory, Dulles this time did not hesitate to obliterate historical facts and overturn international agreements that the United States had signed, vainly attempting to deny China's inalienable sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. He unreasonably said that after Japan's surrender, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands "have never been transferred to any other country," therefore, these regions "have a special international status." However, everyone knows that whether from a historical perspective, from the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation signed by the United States, or even from statements and talks made by American political representatives, including former President Truman, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are recognized as part of Chinese territory. Moreover, in fact, China accepted the surrender of the Japanese army in Taiwan after Japan's surrender, and the Chinese people in Taiwan have since returned to the embrace of their motherland.
    Dulles's entire speech at the press conference exposed that all the current activities of the American aggression clique are aimed at creating tensions in Asia and the world. He demanded that the member states of the Southeast Asia war group, which was formed not long ago at the Manila Conference, "meet immediately" to implement the U.S. aggression plan under the guise of dealing with so-called "communist subversion." In addition, Dulles openly rejected the Soviet Union's recent proposal to convene an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, without any reason, but simply because convening such a meeting, in his view, was "completely impossible."

    美国侵略集团加紧制造亚洲的紧张局势
    杜勒斯妄图以战争威胁来阻挠我解放台湾
    【新华社十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国侵略集团正企图以战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。这种罪恶打算已经由美国国务卿杜勒斯十六日公然暴露出来。杜勒斯在这一天的记者招待会上说：如果中国人民解放台湾，就可能会引起“和美国的敌对行动”。杜勒斯表示，美国可能扩大侵略的范围，采取行动庇护浙江沿海蒋贼军盘踞的大陈岛。他说，虽然大陈岛并不被人认为是台湾的一部分，“但是它可以被认为是包括在台湾防务中的”。杜勒斯还表示，美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间关于签订所谓“共同防御条约”的谈判正在加紧进行中。杜勒斯接连发出这种妄图威胁中国人民的挑衅性叫嚣，完全暴露了美国侵略集团不顾世界舆论的正义谴责，决心强占中国的领土台湾作为它的侵略基地的凶恶面目。
    为了掩饰美国这种强占中国领土的非法行为，杜勒斯这次不惜抹煞历史事实并且推翻美国曾签过字的国际协定，徒然地企图否认中国对台湾和澎湖列岛的不可剥夺的主权。他蛮横无理地说，在日本投降以后，台湾和澎湖列岛“从来没有被再转让给任何其他国家”，因此，这些地区“具有一种特殊的国际地位”。但是，大家知道，不论从历史上来看，从美国参加签署的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告来看，甚至从美国政治代表人物，包括前总统杜鲁门在内，所发表的声明和谈话来看，台湾和澎湖列岛都是公认的中国领土的一部分。而且，事实上，中国在日本投降后已接受了台湾日军的投降，在台湾的中国人民从那时起就已回到了自己祖国的怀抱。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上的全部谈话暴露了美国侵略集团目前的全部活动都是以在亚洲和全世界制造紧张局势为目的的。他提出要求不久以前在马尼拉会议上组成的东南亚战争集团各成员国“立刻开会”，来执行美国在应付所谓“共产主义颠覆活动”的掩盖下的侵略计划。此外，杜勒斯还公然拒绝苏联最近提出的关于召开讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议的建议，没有任何理由，而只是因为召开这样一个会议在他看来，是“完全不可能的事情。”
