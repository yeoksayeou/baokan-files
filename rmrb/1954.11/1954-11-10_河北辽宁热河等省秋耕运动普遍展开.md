Hebei, Liaoning, Rehe, Shanxi and other provinces have universally launched the autumn cultivation movement. In Hebei Province, as of October 28, according to statistics from 68 counties in seven special districts including Handan, Xingtai, and Tangshan, over 16 million mu of land have been cultivated. The Zhangjiakou Special District has made faster progress, and by the end of October, it had completed 88 percent of the autumn cultivation task, and it can be universally completed once in early November. In the southern part of Liaoning Province, threshing has ended and the transition to autumn cultivation has begun. The central and northern parts are combining careful harvesting and threshing to strive for more cultivation. In places such as Lushun-Dalian, Xinjin, and Fuxian, 6.7 percent of the large fields have been cultivated. In Yixian, Heishan and other places, more than 10,000 hectares have been cultivated. In Rehe Province, as of October 25, Chifeng County had plowed more than 620,000 mu of land, accounting for 61 percent of the county's arable land, including more than 100,000 mu of deep and fine plowing. Zuoyun County, Shanxi Province, which has made rapid progress in autumn cultivation, had cultivated 748,000 mu by October 25, reaching 85 percent of the county's cultivable land area. Minhe, Hualong, Ledu, Huangyuan and other places in Qinghai Province are also actively carrying out autumn cultivation.

Many regions are paying attention to combining autumn cultivation with the cooperative movement. The general branch of the Communist Party of China in Longwan Township, Shunyi County, Hebei Province, has made unified arrangements for cooperative construction and autumn cultivation production, helping agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers in various villages to formulate production plans and rationally organize labor. Farmers in the township carry out autumn cultivation during the day and discuss cooperative construction in the evening, ensuring that cooperative construction and autumn cultivation are not delayed.

All localities also attach great importance to technical guidance in autumn cultivation work, and have promoted a number of walking plows and double-wheeled double-furrow plows. Hebei Province promoted more than 8,000 walking plows and more than 600 double-wheeled double-furrow plows in conjunction with autumn cultivation. When promoting new agricultural tools, methods such as key demonstrations, organized visits, short-term training, and physical object explanations were also adopted to introduce the effectiveness and use techniques of the new agricultural tools. In Cangxian, Tangshan, and Shijiazhuang special districts alone, 640 horse-drawn agricultural implement operators were trained, and more than 50,000 farmers were organized to visit. In the autumn, Liaoning Province has promoted more than 6,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows and Polish single-furrow plows, and more than 5,000 other agricultural tools.

At present, crops in various places have been harvested one after another, and autumn cultivation will be further fully launched.

    河北辽宁热河等省秋耕运动普遍展开
    河北、辽宁、热河和山西等省普遍展开秋耕运动。河北省到十月二十八日止，据邯郸、邢台、唐山等七个专区六十八个县的统计，已耕地一千六百多万亩。张家口专区进展较快，十月底已完成秋耕任务百分之八十八，十一月初可以普遍耕完一遍。辽宁省南部地区已结束打场转入秋耕，中部和北部正结合细收细打争取多耕，旅大、新金、复县等地已有百分之六·七的大田耕完，义县、黑山等地也耕了一万多垧。热河省赤峰县截至十月二十五日的统计，已翻地六十二万多亩，占全县可耕地面积百分之六十一，其中并有十万多亩作到深耕细耕。山西省秋耕进展较快的左云县，到十月二十五日已耕了七十四万八千亩，达全县应耕地面积百分之八十五。青海省的民和、化隆、乐都、湟源等地也都在积极进行秋耕。
    许多地区都注意把秋耕工作和合作化运动结合进行。中共河北省顺义县龙湾乡总支部，把建社工作、秋耕生产作了统一的安排，帮助各村农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民，订出了生产计划，合理组织劳力，全乡农民白天秋耕生产，晚上酝酿建社，做到建社秋耕两不误。
    各地在秋耕工作中，对技术指导也很重视，并推广了一批步犁和双轮双铧犁。河北省结合秋耕共推广步犁八千多部，双轮双铧犁六百多部。在推广新式农具时，还采用了重点示范、组织参观、短期训练、实物讲解等办法，介绍了新农具的效能和使用技术。仅沧县、唐山、石家庄三个专区，就训练了六百四十名马拉农具手，组织五万多农民参观。辽宁省秋季已推广双轮双铧犁、波兰一铧犁六千多部，其他农具五千多部。
    目前各地农作物已先后收割完毕，秋耕工作将进一步全面展开。
