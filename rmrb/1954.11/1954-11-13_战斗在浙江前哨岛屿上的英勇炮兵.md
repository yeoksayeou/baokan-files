    Heroic Artillery Fighting on Zhejiang Outpost Islands
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hua Min
    Recently, this reporter boarded a landing craft and landed on a certain island on the Zhejiang coastal defense front, and visited the heroic artillery warriors of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who fight day and night on this outpost island.
    Looking southeast from this island, one can see a dark mountain standing in the turbulent sea. This is a small island occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Through binoculars, one can clearly see the bunkers and trenches of Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the island winding around the hillside. At night, one can also see the flashing signal lights emanating from there.
    After the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated this small island that I visited this year, this artillery unit and the brother troops stationed on the island heroically engaged in frequent battles with Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Initially, Chiang Kai-shek's troops took advantage of the fact that our army had just entered the island and constantly bombarded and harassed our army. However, this artillery unit struck Chiang Kai-shek's troops harder each time. One morning, when our island troops were building fortifications, Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the island suddenly began shelling our army. The first shell landed on the beach, and the subsequent shells all landed in the water. At this time, the gunners of our island's coastal defense artillery had calmly and quickly turned the huge gun muzzles towards Chiang Kai-shek's artillery positions. Just as the sixth shell from Chiang Kai-shek's troops made its exit sound, our artillery suddenly roared, and groups of shells crossed the sea surface and accurately hit Chiang Kai-shek's artillery positions. The position was immediately blown into a cloud of smoke, and the artillery fortifications were also collapsed. Later, every time Chiang Kai-shek's troops shelled our positions, our coastal defense artillery immediately fired more shells to retaliate fiercely until Chiang Kai-shek's troops could not fire any more shells.
    Under the heavy blows of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense artillery, Chiang Kai-shek's troops cunningly built some fake fortifications on the island they occupied, trying to evade the blows of our coastal defense artillery and dreaming of using this to attract our army's firepower and take the opportunity to attack our coastal defense artillery. However, they still could not hide from the sharp eyes of our coastal defense artillery. Once, just as Chiang Kai-shek's troops stealthily extended the barrel of a cannon from a disguised fortification, our coastal defense artillery immediately launched a fierce bombardment against it, causing Chiang Kai-shek's troops to not dare to shell our positions for several months. However, our coastal defense artillerymen still actively searched for all possible targets to severely strike Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On the evening of August 30, in the dim twilight, artillery observer Xu Jicheng saw from the gun sight that about a company of Chiang Kai-shek's troops was gathering on the island occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The artillery commander immediately ordered a bombardment, and dense shells flew like eyes toward the crowd of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. From the firelight of the shell explosions, one could vaguely see the embarrassed appearance of Chiang Kai-shek's troops being scattered and fleeing by the artillery fire.
    Under the heavy blows of our coastal defense artillery, Chiang Kai-shek's troops were frightened like startled birds. Once, when our engineering troops were using explosives to open up roads, more than a dozen Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who were repairing fortifications were stunned by the continuous explosions. Some ran away, and some lay down on the spot. After a long time, when they did not hear the explosion of shells, they timidly crawled up. But just at this time, our coastal defense artillery really opened fire and bombarded them.
    One morning, several artillery observers of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, carrying gun sights, attempted to observe our army's positions under the cover of morning mist and low woods. However, they were immediately discovered by our coastal defense artillery. Model gunner Jiang Rongguan turned the aiming mirror and said humorously: "Without approval, no random visits are allowed!" Before Chiang Kai-shek's observers could prop up the tripod of the gun sight, Jiang Rongguan immediately opened fire and bombarded them. The Chiang Kai-shek observers were so frightened that they dropped the gun sights and fled desperately.
    After the artillery of Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupying the island was beaten so badly that they did not dare to show their heads, Chiang Kai-shek used warships to bombard our positions from the sea further away, but they could not escape the blows of our coastal defense artillery. At noon on June 1, two warships of Chiang Kai-shek's troops shelled our island positions. At that time, our army commander ordered each artillery piece to immediately bombard Chiang Kai-shek's warships with the most fierce artillery fire. A large number of shells then flew toward the surroundings of Chiang Kai-shek's warships and exploded, and black smoke also rose from the decks of the warships. Seeing that the situation was not good, Chiang Kai-shek's warships hurriedly released a large amount of smoke screen and fled. Then Chiang Kai-shek's planes flew in to attack. At this time, our island's anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft weapons on the People's Navy warships simultaneously launched anti-aircraft fire. A Chiang Kai-shek plane that was diving was immediately hit, and the fuselage fell into the sea with smoke and fire. The remaining Chiang Kai-shek planes were all frightened and fled in all directions.
    The artillery warriors on our island fought heroically day and night on the front line of Zhejiang's coastal defense, continuously and heavily striking Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Since entering November, these heroic artillerymen have repeatedly joined forces with their air force comrades to severely strike Chiang Kai-shek's troops, continuing to destroy many military targets on the island occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and damaging a Yongzi-class warship of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and thus received a commendation from the leading organs of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front.
    Now, these heroic artillery warriors are continuing to guard their posts with high vigilance, ready to meet new combat missions at any time and eliminate more of Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

    战斗在浙江前哨岛屿上的英勇炮兵
    新华社记者　华敏
    最近，记者乘登陆艇登上了浙江海防前线的某岛，访问了日日夜夜英勇地战斗在这个前哨岛屿上的中国人民解放军炮兵勇士们。
    从这个岛上向东南方向望去，可以看到矗立在波涛汹涌的大海中的一座黑黝黝的山岗，这就是蒋贼军盘踞的一个小岛。从望远镜中了望，能够清晰地看到岛上蒋贼军的碉堡和蜿蜒在山腰的战壕，晚上还可以看到从那里发出来的闪烁的信号灯光。
    今年中国人民解放军解放了我所到的这个小岛以后，这支炮兵部队和驻守在岛上的兄弟部队就英勇地和蒋贼军展开了频繁的战斗。起初，蒋贼军趁我军刚进驻岛上不久，曾不断地向我军打炮袭扰。但是，这支炮兵部队却一次比一次沉重地痛击了蒋贼军。有一天上午，我军岛上部队正在做工事，蒋贼军盘踞的岛上突然向我军打起炮来，第一发炮弹落在海滩上，以后的几发都打在海水里。这时，岛上我军海防炮兵的炮手们已沉着而迅速地把巨大的炮口转向了蒋贼军的炮兵阵地。当蒋贼军的第六发炮弹刚响起出口声音时，我们的大炮突然怒吼起来了，成群的炮弹越过海面，准确地打在蒋贼军的炮兵阵地上，这个阵地顿时被炸成一片浓烟，炮工事也被打塌了。后来，蒋贼军每次向我军阵地打炮时，我军海防炮兵也都立刻发射出更多的炮弹，猛烈地进行还击，直到打得蒋贼军发射不出炮弹来。
    在人民解放军海防炮兵的沉重打击下，蒋贼军在它盘踞的岛上狡猾地做了一些假工事，企图逃避我海防炮兵的打击，并且梦想以此吸引我军火力，乘机袭击我海防炮兵。但是，它仍然没有能瞒住我海防炮兵的锐利的眼睛。有一次，蒋贼军鬼鬼祟祟地刚把一门炮的炮筒从伪装的工事里伸出来，我海防炮兵们立即向它进行了猛烈的轰击，打得蒋贼军一连有几个月的时间不敢向我军阵地发炮了。然而，我海防炮兵们仍然积极寻找一切可能找到的目标来痛击蒋贼军。八月三十日傍晚，在暮色苍茫中，炮兵观测员徐继成从炮对镜里看到蒋贼军盘踞的岛上约有一个连正在集合，炮兵指挥员马上下令轰击，密集的炮弹就像长了眼睛似的一齐飞向蒋贼军的人群里。从炮弹爆炸的火光里，可以隐约地看到蒋贼军被炮火打得四散奔逃的狼狈相。
    在我海防炮兵的沉重打击下，蒋贼军已吓得像惊弓之鸟。有一次，当我工兵部队在使用炸药开辟道路时，正在修补工事的十多个蒋贼军被连续的爆炸声吓呆了，有的连忙逃跑，有的就地卧倒，过了许久，听不到炮弹爆炸时，他们才胆怯地爬了起来。但是，就在这时，我海防炮兵真的向他们开炮轰击了。
    有一天早晨，几个蒋贼军的炮兵观测员扛着炮对镜，企图借着朝雾和矮树林的掩蔽来观测我军阵地。但是，立刻就被我海防炮兵发现了，功臣炮手姜荣官一面转动瞄准镜，一面诙谐地说：“没有经过批准，不准随便参观！”当蒋贼军观测员还没有把炮对镜的三角架撑开时，姜荣官马上向他们开炮轰击了，这几个蒋贼军观测员吓得丢下炮对镜，拚命地逃走了。
    盘踞岛上的蒋贼军的炮兵被打得不敢露头以后，蒋贼又用兵舰从较远的海面上来轰击我军阵地，但是也没能逃脱我海防炮兵的打击。六月一日中午，有两艘蒋贼军舰向我岛上阵地打炮。当时，我军指挥员命令各炮立即用最猛烈的炮火向蒋贼军舰轰击，大批的炮弹随即飞向蒋贼军舰周围爆炸起来，军舰甲板上也被轰击得冒起了黑烟。蒋贼军舰见势不妙，慌忙地施放起大量的烟幕逃跑了。接着蒋贼飞机又飞来袭击了。这时，我岛上高射炮火和人民海军舰艇上的高射火器便同时展开了对空射击。有一架正在进行俯冲的蒋贼军飞机当即被击中，机身上冒着烟火坠入海里去了，其余的几架蒋贼飞机都吓得四散逃去。
    我岛上的炮兵勇士们就这样英勇地日日夜夜地战斗在浙江海防最前线上，接连不断地沉重地打击蒋贼军。进入十一月以来，这支英勇的炮兵们又多次地和空军战友们联合痛击了蒋贼军，继续摧毁了蒋贼军所盘踞的岛上的许多军事目标，并击伤了蒋贼军一艘永字号军舰，因而受到了浙江前线中国人民解放军某部领导机关的通报表扬。
    现在，这支英勇的炮兵勇士们正高度警惕地继续守卫在自己的岗位上，准备随时迎接新的战斗任务，更多地消灭蒋贼军。
