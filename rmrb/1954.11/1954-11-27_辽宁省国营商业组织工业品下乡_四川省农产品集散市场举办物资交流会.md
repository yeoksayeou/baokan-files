Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. Liaoning Province's state-owned commercial system's work in organizing industrial products to the countryside has achieved initial results.  In counties such as Tieling, Kaiyuan, and Faku, under the leadership of the county party committees, the People's Bank, Grain Bureau, cooperatives, and state-owned commercial companies organized joint inspection teams to go deep into the districts to help cooperatives with accounting, understand farmers' needs, and overcome the cooperatives' passive waiting mentality. Now, some cooperatives have begun to purchase goods in large quantities, adding some commodities that they had not previously handled. For example, the Daqingduizi Cooperative in Tieling purchased 109 kinds of commodities from the county department store in a single day on November 8th.  With the help of the liaison officer from the Jinxi County Department Store Wholesale Department, the cooperatives in Jinxi County studied the needs of farmers, corrected the price differences of 206 kinds of commodities, and promptly purchased goods worth 100 million yuan. Some city and county state-owned commercial departments have gradually increased their sales after changing their previous "waiting for customers" mentality. The Tieling Department Store Wholesale Department's sales in the first five days of November increased by 70.2 percent compared with the last five days of October.  The Faku County Department Store Wholesale Department's sales in the first ten days of November increased by two times compared with the last ten days of October.

In the work of organizing industrial products to the countryside, many places have adopted the form of industrial and commercial exchange exhibitions or "delivery to the door," which has achieved good results.  Liaoyang City organized a commodity exchange exhibition and dispatched rural work groups to go deep into the countryside to help grassroots cooperatives purchase goods, with a turnover of more than 4 billion yuan.  In November, Kaiyuan County implemented a joint office method for grain, monopoly, cotton yarn, and banking departments, simplifying procurement procedures and enabling grassroots cooperatives to purchase goods in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 26th.  Agricultural product distribution markets in various parts of Sichuan Province are holding materials exchange fairs to coordinate the unified purchase of grain and cotton, and supply farmers with industrial products.  The Leshan Special District has held 214 materials exchange fairs, with a transaction amount of more than 5.8 billion yuan.  Nine counties in the Wenjiang Special District have held industrial product exhibitions in county towns, with a transaction amount of 25.555 billion yuan, and are now being held in various townships.  More than 100 townships in Jiangjin County have held small-scale materials exchange fairs.

The materials exchange fairs held in various places mainly supply industrial products, adopting the method of "simultaneous publicity, exhibition, and supply."  Yijiaba, a remote area in District One of Guanghan County, although it rained during the materials exchange fair, more than 1,000 people came to visit and purchase goods every day, with a transaction volume of more than 7 million yuan.  Many women and elderly people who rarely went to the city in the past bought their favorite items.

    辽宁省国营商业组织工业品下乡
    四川省农产品集散市场举办物资交流会
   【本报沈阳二十六日电】辽宁省国营商业系统组织工业品下乡的工作，初步获得成绩。铁岭、开原、法库等县，在县委领导下，先后由人民银行、粮食局、合作社和国营商业公司等单位组织了联合检查组，深入各区帮助合作社算账，了解农民需要，克服合作社的消极等待思想。现在，有些合作社已经开始大量进货，增添了一些过去没有经营过的商品。如铁岭大青堆子合作社，十一月八日一天就到县百货公司采了一百零九种商品。锦西县合作社由于县百货批发部联络员的帮助，研究了农民的需要，纠正了二百零六种商品的差价，并及时进货一亿元。有的市县国营商业部门，转变了过去“等客上门”的思想后，卖钱额逐渐上升。铁岭百货批发部十一月份头五天较十月份最后五天卖钱增加百分之七十点二。法库县百货批发部十一月上旬较十月下旬卖钱额增加了两倍。
    在组织工业品下乡工作中，许多地方采用工商品交流展览或“送货到门”的形式，收效很好。辽阳市组织了商品交流展览会，并派遣下乡小组深入农村帮助基层合作社进货，成交额达四十多亿元。开原县十一月份实行粮食、专卖、花纱、银行等机关联合办公的办法，简化了采购手续，使基层合作社能及时进货。
    据新华社成都二十六日电：四川省各地农产品集散市场举办物资交流会，配合粮食、棉花的统购，供应农民工业品。乐山专区各地已举办了物资交流会二百一十四次，成交金额达五十八亿多元。温江专区有九个县已在县城内召开了工业品展览会，成交金额为二百五十五亿五千多万元，现正在各乡镇召开。江津县已有一百多个乡镇召开了小型物资交流会。
    各地举办的物资交流会都是以供应工业品为主，采取“边宣传、边展览、边供应”的办法进行。广汉县一区易家坝是一个偏僻的地区，在举办物资交流会期间虽逢下雨，每天到会参观和选购物品的群众也都在千人以上，交易额达七百多万元。许多过去很少进城的妇女、老人都买到了喜爱的物品。
