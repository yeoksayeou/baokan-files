(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th) Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th: On November 9, 1954, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in answering some questions posed to him by Agence France-Presse reporter Bernard Ullmann, stated that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would strictly adhere to the Geneva Accords and tirelessly strive to achieve the reunification of Vietnam. The content of the questions and answers is as follows:

Question 1: Mr. Chairman, what do you consider the best way to establish trust and friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France, and to rebuild a favorable atmosphere between the two countries after this eight-year war?

Answer: I believe the best way is mutual understanding, absolute fidelity, and mutual trust.

Question 2: What is your view on the prospects for economic relations between the two countries?
If French private or official entities were to offer you a loan, would you accept it, and under what conditions?

Answer: The economic relations between our two countries should be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.
This is a matter to be discussed by the relevant parties on both sides.

Question 3: Do you think that Mr. Sainteny's return to Hanoi as the French representative will greatly help restore trust between France and the Democratic Republic?
Do you think it is indispensable for your government to send a corresponding representative to Paris?

Answer: We have known Mr. Sainteny for a long time. I believe he can contribute to restoring trust between our two countries, if our efforts are not hampered by a series of major obstacles.

We have a saying: "There must be give and take, to fulfill each other's wishes," which means that anything must naturally be reciprocal.

Question 4: Do you believe that the situation in South Vietnam will develop in such a way that it will be impossible to wait until the elections that will determine the fate of the entire Vietnam are held in two years?
Are you worried that the current division of Vietnam may continue like the division of Germany and Korea, which were also originally intended to be temporary?

Answer: The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will strictly abide by the Geneva Accords and tirelessly strive to achieve the reunification of our country.
The situation in Vietnam is different from the situations in Korea and Germany.

Question 5: Are you prepared to make any trips outside of Vietnam in the near future?

Answer: I have no such plans at the moment.

Question 6: Do you think it is appropriate for a significant number of French people who left Hanoi on the eve of the People's Army's entry into Hanoi to return?
In which activity sectors would it be most appropriate to have French technicians and businessmen?
Do you intend to invite technicians from China, the Soviet Union, or people's democratic countries to work for the revitalization and development of Vietnam?

Answer: If they return, they will be well received.
Economic activity sectors.
We are currently studying this issue.

Question 7: Do you intend to develop a plan for Vietnam's economic development? Do you think it is possible to create a plan for the entire Vietnam before Vietnam is unified?

Answer: In our time, I believe that all economies must be planned to a greater or lesser extent. A national plan must be formulated by a complete nation.

Question 8: During the Geneva Conference, Mr. Pham Van Dong spoke about the possibility of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam remaining within the French Union. How do you view this possibility from a practical perspective?
Would it be necessary to amend the French Constitution to do so?
Do you think that the current sentiment in both Vietnam and France is prepared to establish organizational links between two such different political systems?

Answer: If both sides have the desire, our two governments can discuss the possibility and conditions for Vietnam's eventual participation in the French Union.
The French Constitution is an internal affair of the French people; it is their business.
I think the sentiment of the Vietnamese people, as well as the French people, is willing to consider this issue because peaceful coexistence between two different political systems is possible.

    胡志明主席答法新社记者问
    【新华社十日讯】越南通讯社河内十日讯：一九五四年十一月九日胡志明主席在答复法新社记者伯纳·乌尔曼向他提出的一些问题时说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府将严格依照日内瓦协定，不倦地为实现越南的统一而努力。问答的内容如下：
    问一：主席先生，你认为建立越南民主共和国和法国之间的信任和友好关系，和在这八年战争之后重建两国之间的有利气氛的最好办法是什么？
    答：我认为最好的办法就是互相谅解，绝对忠实和互相信任。
    问二：你对两国之间经济关系的前景的看法怎样？
    如果法国私人或官方建议给你贷款，你是否接受，根据什么条件接受？
    答：我们两国之间的经济关系应当以平等和互利的原则为基础。
    这是一个要由双方有关方面讨论的问题。
    问三：你是否认为圣德尼先生重返河内任法国代表将在很大程度上有助于恢复法国和民主共和国之间的信任关系？
    你是否认为贵国政府派一位相应代表驻在巴黎是不可缺少的？
    答：我们很早就认识圣德尼先生。我认为他是能够为恢复我们两国之间的信任关系作出贡献的，如果我们的努力不受一系列的重大障碍妨害的话。
    我们有一句俗话是：“有往有来，互遂心愿”，它的意思是：任何一件事自然都必须是相互的。
    问四：你是否相信南越局势会这样发展，以致不可能等到两年之后就要举行决定整个越南命运的选举？
    你是否担心越南目前的分治可能像德国和朝鲜的分治那样持续下去？这种分治原来也只准备是暂时性的。
    答：越南人民和越南民主共和国政府将严格依照日内瓦协定，不倦地为实现我国的统一而努力。
    越南的情况是同朝鲜和德国的情况不同的。
    问五：你是否准备在最近的将来作任何离开越南的旅行？
    答：目前我还没有这种打算。
    问六：你是否认为在人民军进入河内的前夕离开河内的相当大一部分法国人回到河内来是适宜的？
    你认为哪些活动部门里最宜于有法国的技术人员和商人？
    你是否打算请中国、苏联或人民民主国家的技术人员为越南的复兴和发展而工作？
    答：如果他们回来，他们将受到良好的接待。
    经济活动部门。
    现在我们正在研究这个问题。
    问七：你是否打算为越南的经济发展而进行计划？你是否认为在越南获得统一以前就可能为整个越南作出计划？
    答：在我们的时代里，我认为一切经济必须或多或少地加以计划。一个全国性的计划必须由完整的国家来制订。
    问八：在日内瓦会议期间范文同先生曾谈到越南民主共和国留在法兰西联邦范围内的可能性。你怎样从一个实际的角度来看这个可能？
    要这样做是否必须修改法国宪法？
    你是否认为越南和法国两国国内目前的情绪已有所准备，可以建立两个这样不相同的政治制度之间的组织联系？
    答：如果双方有这个愿望的话，我们两国政府可以讨论越南最后参加法兰西联邦的可能和条件。
    法国宪法是法国人民的内政问题，那只是他们的事。
    我想越南人民以及法国人民的情绪是愿意考虑这个问题的，因为两个不同的政治制度和平共处是可能的。
