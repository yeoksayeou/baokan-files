    A new soil testing laboratory has been established in the Yellow River irrigation area of Henan Province. This soil testing laboratory is fully equipped and can analyze fifty soil samples simultaneously. In the past, when the Yellow River irrigation area needed to conduct soil testing, soil samples had to be taken from the local area and sent to the North China Agricultural Science Institute in Beijing. Now, with this equipment, soil can be tested locally, providing timely guidance for irrigation and agricultural production. The establishment of the laboratory will play a certain role in guaranteeing the soil of more than 570,000 mu of farmland in the irrigation area and in transforming more than 100,000 mu of saline-alkali land within the irrigation area.

    引黄灌溉区建立土壤化验室
    河南省引黄灌溉区新建立了一个土壤化验室。这个土壤化验室设备齐全，可以同时作五十个土样分析。过去，引黄灌溉区进行土壤化验时，需要由当地取出土样送到北京华北农业科学研究所去；现在有了这套设备，土壤就可以在当地化验，及时指导灌溉和农业生产。化验室的建立，对保证灌溉区五十七万多亩农田土壤，改造灌溉区内的十余万亩盐碱土地，都有一定作用。（新华社）
