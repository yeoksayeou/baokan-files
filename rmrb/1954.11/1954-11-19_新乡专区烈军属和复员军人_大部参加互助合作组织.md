    Most Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Demobilized Soldiers in Xinxiang Prefecture
    Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations

    In Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, 80 percent of the families of revolutionary martyrs and demobilized soldiers have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After joining the cooperatives, many demobilized soldiers were elected as leading cadres within the cooperatives. In the Eighth District of Jiyuan County, there are forty-six demobilized soldiers, forty-one of whom have joined the cooperatives, and eleven of whom have been elected as chairmen or vice-chairmen. The participation of families of revolutionary martyrs in the cooperatives has fundamentally solved the problems of processing and output in past substitute farming, while also increasing the income of the families of revolutionary martyrs. After Wang Zigong, a family member of a soldier in Nantian Township, Bo'ai County, joined the cooperative, he harvested more than 1,370 extra jin of grain this year compared to last year.

    新乡专区烈军属和复员军人
    大部参加互助合作组织
    河南省新乡专区已有百分之八十的烈军属和复员军人参加了互助合作组织。复员军人入社后，有许多当选为社内领导干部。济源县八区有四十六个复员军人，其中四十一个入了社，有十一个当选为正副社长。烈军属入了社从根本上解决了过去代耕中的加工、产量等问题，同时也增加了烈军属的收入。博爱县南田乡军属王子功入了社后，今年就比去年多收了一千三百七十多斤粮食。（王毕太）
