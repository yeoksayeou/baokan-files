    Baise - A Beautiful Mountain City
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Chen Pengsheng
    Starting from Nanning City, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and traversing countless hills for over 500 li, one arrives at the gateway to the Autonomous Region's "Native Produce Warehouse"—Baise County.
    In Baise City, colorful flowers bloom in front of houses and behind streets. Evergreen trees such as phoenix trees, acacia trees, red eucalyptus, and banyan trees set off the red and white public buildings, making the entire city resemble a park. Sugarcane fields, banana plantations, and bamboo groves on both banks of the Chengbi River encircle the city walls. The Yongse and Baidu highways extend windingly from here towards Nanning and Badu on the border of Guizhou and Guangxi.
    This year, the Baise Special District has achieved bumper harvests of grain, star anise, tung oil, tea oil, cane sugar, and other products. Every day, large quantities of local and special products are transported from all directions by horses and people. Shipping boxes and bamboo baskets destined for various places are piled up like small mountains. State-owned trading companies and cooperative stores attract a constant stream of customers.
    There are now industrial facilities for electricity, ironworking, textiles, rice milling, and papermaking here. This year, more than a dozen state-owned specialized companies have newly established and expanded their organizations here. Joint state-private and private small-scale industries such as oil pressing, metal manufacturing, and woodwork have developed to more than ten. The output of agricultural tools, bamboo ware, and other handicrafts has increased by one to two times compared to before liberation. A joint state-private tap water plant that is under construction will soon be put into operation.
    During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War in 1929, Baise once established a workers' and peasants' democratic government. Later, when the Red Seventh Army went north to resist Japan, the Baise Special District was occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The reactionaries carried out a frenzied massacre of the revolutionary ethnic minority workers and peasants. It was not until the liberation of the Baise Special District in 1949 that this city of disaster was revived.

    百色——美丽的山城
    新华社记者　陈蓬生
    从桂西僮族自治区首府——南宁市乘汽车出发，越过无数的山坡，行程五百多里，就到了自治区“土产仓库”的大门——百色县城。
    百色城里街前屋后，五颜六色的花朵盛开。凤凰、相思、红桉、榕树等常绿树衬托着红白色的公共建筑物，全城像一座公园。澄碧江两岸的甘蔗林、香蕉园、竹丛环抱着城垣。邕色、百渡两条公路，从这里弯弯曲曲伸向南宁和黔桂边境的八渡。
    今年百色专区产的粮食、八角、桐油、茶油、蔗糖等都获得丰收。每天都有大批马驮、人挑的土产品和特产品从四面八方运来。发往各地的货箱、竹篓，堆积得像小山一样。国营贸易公司和合作社门市部吸引着来往不断的顾客。
    现在这里已有电力、铁工、纺织、碾米、造纸等工业设备。今年有十多个国营专业公司在这里新建和扩建了机构，公私合营和私营的榨油、金属制造、木器等小型工业已发展到十多家。农具、竹器等手工业产量比解放前增加一倍到两倍。正在修建的一座公私合营的自来水厂不久就可开工了。
    一九二九年第二次国内革命战争时期，百色曾经一度建立过工农民主政权，后来，红七军北上抗日，百色专区又被国民党反动派占领，反动派对革命的少数民族工农群众实行疯狂的残杀。直到一九四九年百色专区解放后，这座灾难的山城才重新复活起来。
