    The majority of flood victims from the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Dongting and Poyang Lake areas who were relocated during this year's flood season have now returned home. As of now, with the exception of a few flood victims in low-lying areas of Hubei Province who have not yet returned due to standing water, the vast majority of flood victims in the province have returned home. In Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, more than 95% of the flood victims have returned home. In Jiangsu Province, the number of returning flood victims accounts for more than 75% of the total number of relocated flood victims. In Anhui Province, more than half of the flood victims have also returned home.

    To lead the flood victims back home, the aforementioned regions have all established special Flood Victim Return Committees and formulated plans to gradually lead the flood victims back home. Based on the receding floodwaters, flood victims are organized in batches to return home, based on the township, village, or mutual aid cooperative. Relevant departments in various regions have prepared transportation and various living supplies for the returning flood victims. In addition to the cadres who were originally transferred with the flood victims, the people's governments of the flood victims' original areas are responsible for sending cadres to the resettlement areas to greet them and lead them back home. The governments and people of the various resettlement areas are also very concerned about the flood victims. In Hubei Province, the people of Jingmen County set up escort stations along the way to help the flood victims in Jianli County return home. Some areas also held farewell meetings, and many farmers invited the flood victims to eat and carried their luggage for them. Farmers in Beizhen Township, Fifth District of Xianning County, sent 1,895 pieces of "fa gao" made of rice to the flood victims as dry food for the journey, and farmers in Tongcheng County also donated more than a dozen kinds of vegetable seeds such as radishes, cowpeas, and amaranth to the returning flood victims.

    After the flood victims return home, the people's governments in various regions help them solve the difficulties in production and life. Anhui Province has allocated 82 billion yuan in housing subsidies to the disaster areas, and the People's Bank of Anhui Province has issued 100 billion yuan in living loans. The supply and marketing cooperative departments have also transferred 3 million catties of mao bamboo and 1.6 million catties of house siding from other provinces. Fuyang Prefecture purchased a large number of materials from other provinces for the flood victims to build houses, including 250,000 catties of sorghum stalks and 340,000 catties of straw curtains. Fengtai County also allocated 1,704 tents and more than 70,000 reed mats to solve the temporary housing difficulties of the flood victims. To date, according to incomplete statistics from the three prefectures of Fuyang, Lu'an, and Su County and Bengbu City, more than 618,000 houses have been built. In order to help the flood victims get through the winter, Hubei Province promptly transported 1,100,800 cotton-padded clothes donated by urban people and ordered by the government to the disaster areas. Many places have also organized flood victims to use old materials and wood salvaged from the water to solve housing difficulties. Eight miles of the Bazhen township in Huangpi County used this method to solve the housing problems of 490 households. Since September, Jiangxi Province has allocated 19.4 billion yuan in relief funds to the disaster areas. Most of the collapsed houses in the disaster area of ​​Xinjian County have been repaired, and more than 7,800 houses have been repaired in Yugan County.

    After the lives of the flood victims have stabilized, various regions have actively organized the flood victims to engage in production for self-relief, and have promptly issued agricultural loans and transferred seeds to help the affected farmers replant winter crops. In some disaster areas in northern Anhui, 70% of the winter planting task has been completed. The progress of winter plowing and winter planting in some disaster areas in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi is also very fast. Various regions have also universally carried out sideline production under the principle of not affecting agricultural production. Twenty-five townships in Funan County, Anhui Province, have organized flood victims who catch 16,000 catties of fish every day. In Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, the sideline income of organized flood victims has reached 1.68 billion yuan. In Poyang County, it is estimated that the income from organizing flood victims to fish, chop firewood, and transport goods this winter will reach 18.33 billion yuan. The supply and marketing departments in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, have purchased more than 12 million catties of fish from flood victims. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江淮地区转移到外地的灾民大部返乡
    各地人民政府积极帮助灾民重建家园生产自救
    今年防汛期间转移到外地的长江、淮河沿岸和洞庭、鄱阳湖滨地区的灾民，现在已经大部分返乡。截至目前止，湖北省除个别低洼地区灾民因积水未退尚未返乡外，全省绝大部分灾区的灾民已经返乡。湖南、江西两省已有百分之九十五以上的灾民返乡。江苏省返乡灾民占外移灾民总数百分之七十五以上。安徽省也有一半以上的灾民返乡。
    为领导灾民返乡，上述各地都专门成立了灾民返乡委员会，并制订了逐步领导灾民返乡的计划，根据退水情况，以乡、村或互助合作组织为单位，组织灾民分批返乡。各地有关部门分别为返乡灾民准备了交通工具和各种生活资料。灾民返乡时，除原随灾民转移的干部外，都由灾民原籍地区的人民政府负责干部前往安置区迎接并带领一同返乡。各安置地区的政府和人民对灾民也非常关心。湖北省荆门县人民为了帮助监利县灾民返乡，沿途设立护送站，有些地区还举行欢送会，许多农民请灾民吃饭，给灾民挑行李。咸宁县五区北镇乡农民送给灾民用大米做的“发糕”一千八百九十五块作途中干粮，通城县农民还赠给返乡灾民萝卜、豆角、苋菜等十多种蔬菜种籽。
    灾民返乡后，各地人民政府都帮助他们解决生产和生活的困难问题。安徽省已拨发灾区修房补助费八百二十亿元，安徽省人民银行并发放生活贷款一千亿元，供销合作部门也从外省调拨了毛竹三百万斤，房笆一百六十万斤。阜阳专区从外省购买了大批材料，供灾民盖房用，计有秫秸笆二十五万斤，草帘三十四万斤；凤台县还拨下一千七百零四顶帐篷，七万多条芦席，解决灾民临时住房困难。到目前为止，据阜阳、六安、宿县三个专区和蚌埠市不完全统计，已盖好六十一万八千多间房屋。湖北省为帮助灾民过冬，及时地把城市人民捐献和政府订制的一百一十万零八千件棉衣运往灾区。不少地方还组织灾民利用旧料和从水里打捞的木料解决住房困难。黄陂县八埠海乡运用这种办法解决了四百九十户住房问题。江西省九月以来拨给灾区救济款达一百九十四亿元，新建县灾区倒塌的房屋已大部修复，余干县修复的房屋有七千八百多间。
    在灾民生活稳定下来以后，各地又积极组织灾民生产自救，并及时地发放了农业贷款，调运了种籽，帮助受灾农民补种冬季作物。安徽省淮北某些灾区冬种任务已完成百分之七十。湖北、湖南、江西某些灾区冬耕冬种的进度也很快。各地还在不影响农业生产的原则下普遍开展了副业生产。安徽省阜南县二十五个乡组织起来的灾民，每天捕鱼一万六千斤。江西省九江县组织起来的灾民，副业收入已达十六亿八千多万元；鄱阳县组织灾民捕鱼、打柴、运输，预计今冬可收入一百八十三亿三千万元。湖北省孝感专区供销部门，向灾民收购的鱼，已达一千二百多万斤。　（新华社）
