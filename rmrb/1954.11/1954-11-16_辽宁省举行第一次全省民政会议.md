Liaoning Province Holds First Provincial Civil Affairs Conference

Liaoning Province convened its first provincial civil affairs conference to discuss how to strengthen the construction of political power. The conference was held from October 25th to November 3rd.

Based on the new requirements for civil affairs work put forward by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the first provincial civil affairs conference in Liaoning Province focused on studying how to further consolidate the system of People's Congresses, improve work on preferential treatment and relief, and serve socialist construction and socialist transformation. The conference considered that the system of People's Congresses should be further consolidated in the future; the construction of political power in urban and industrial and mining areas should be strengthened; the work of rural political power should be further improved to meet the needs of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; and it was decided to appropriately expand administrative villages and change them to township establishments.

The conference reviewed the implementation of the resolutions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference in various regions. Since the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, civil affairs departments at all levels have further clarified the idea that the political power during the transition period should serve economic construction and socialist transformation. The province has successively conducted investigations and studies in six cities, four mining areas, fourteen small towns, and some streets, and summarized some experiences in serving industrial and mining production. Some urban political power departments criticized the incorrect idea that "it is impossible to serve industrial and mining production without leading industrial and mining production." Cities such as Lüda and Fushun, through the meetings of district people's congresses, discussed and resolved problems in industrial production, as well as problems directly related to industrial production, and actively carried out work to serve industrial and mining production directly or indirectly. Political power departments in small towns have also strengthened their leadership in the transformation of handicrafts and the promotion of the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In rural areas, the connection between basic political power and the masses has been strengthened, and the work efficiency of basic political power has been improved. Twenty-six counties and cities in Liaoning Province conducted investigations in fifty-five villages to study how to strengthen the work of basic political power in response to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At the same time, the province also paid attention to combining various tasks to improve the work of basic political power, making the number of advanced villages in the province greatly increased. According to statistics from 3,049 villages in fourteen counties, the proportion of villages with better leadership and promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation movement after the general election has increased from 23.6 percent to 40.3 percent, and the proportion of weak villages has decreased from 29.8 percent to 10.9 percent.

During the conference, representatives from various regions exchanged experiences in the construction of political power and criticized the erroneous idea of weakening or abolishing village political power held by some rural cadres who believed that "agricultural cooperation has made political power not very useful"; they criticized the wrong practice of not holding meetings of the People's Congress on time and only holding "one-package meetings." The conference pointed out that it is necessary to educate the vast number of cadres to clearly recognize that rural political power is shouldering the arduous and arduous task of transforming the small-peasant economy and organizing the cooperative economy. Production organizations cannot replace political power organizations. Only by fully exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress can the role of the People's Congress be more fully exerted, thereby promoting the cause of socialist transformation.

### 辽宁省举行第一次全省民政会议

    辽宁省举行第一次全省民政会议
    辽宁省召开第一次全省民政会议，讨论如何加强政权建设的问题。会议是在十月二十五日到十一月三日举行的。
    辽宁省第一次全省民政会议根据中华人民共和国宪法对民政工作提出的新的要求，着重研究了如何进一步巩固人民代表大会制度，做好优抚、救济工作，为社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务。会议认为今后应进一步巩固人民代表大会制度；加强城市和工矿地区的政权建设工作；适应互助合作运动发展的需要，进一步改进农村政权工作；并决定将行政村适当扩大，改为乡的建制。
    会议检查了各地执行第二次全国民政会议决议的情况。第二次全国民政会议以后，各级民政部门进一步明确了过渡时期政权为经济建设和社会主义改造服务的思想，全省曾先后在六个市、四个矿区、十四个小城镇和一些街道中进行了调查研究，总结了一些为工矿生产服务的经验。有些城市政权部门批判了“不领导工矿生产无法为工矿生产服务”的不正确思想。旅大、抚顺等市通过区人民代表大会会议，讨论解决了工业生产中的问题，和直接与工业生产有关的问题，并主动地直接或间接地为工矿生产服务开展了工作。小城镇政权部门也加强了对手工业改造和促进城乡物资交流的领导作用。在农村中，加强了基层政权和群众的联系，提高了基层政权的工作效能。辽宁省有二十六个县、市在五十五个村中做了调查，研究了如何适应互助合作运动的发展而相应加强基层政权的工作。同时，全省还注意结合各种任务，改进基层政权的工作，使全省先进村大为增多。据十四个县三千零四十九个村的统计，普选后领导和推动互助合作运动较好的村已由百分之二十三点六上升到百分之四十点三，薄弱村由百分之二十九点八减少到百分之十点九。
    会议期间，各地代表交流了政权建设工作的经验，并批判了某些农村干部认为“农业合作化了，政权没大用处”的削弱或取消村政权的错误思想；批判了不按期召开人民代表大会会议而只开“一揽子会”的错误做法。会议指出，应该教育广大干部明确认识农村政权正负担着改造小农经济、组织合作经济的繁重而艰巨的任务。生产组织不能代替政权组织。只有充分运用了人民代表大会的职权，才能更充分地发挥人民代表大会的作用，进而推进社会主义改造事业。　　（新华社）
