Farmers in Jiangxi and Guangdong Provinces Actively Expand Winter Planting Area

    Jiangxi Province plans a winter planting area of 30 million mu this year, accounting for about 73% of the province's total cultivated land area, an expansion of 81% compared to last year's winter planting area. Among them, grain crops have expanded by 113%, oil crops by 110%, and green manure crops by 59.3%.
    Currently, farmers in various regions are actively carrying out winter plowing and planting. In the areas along the river and near the lake, in order to make up for the losses caused by the disaster, farmers have planted barley, wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and other crops in the fields where the floods have receded. In areas where there is still waterlogging, they are actively draining water and rush-planting. As of October 15th, preliminary statistics from only eight heavily affected counties, including Jiujiang, Pengze, Nanchang, Yongxiu, Yugan, Poyang, Jinxian, and Xinjian, show that more than 400,000 mu of winter crops have been rush-planted. On the basis of doing a good job in winter plowing and planting, farmers are also starting to prepare for next year's spring plowing production.

    Farmers in Guangdong Province are actively expanding the planting area of winter oil crops. The province plans to expand rapeseed from 448,000 mu last year to 874,000 mu. Soybeans will be expanded from 140,000 mu to 300,000 mu, and winter peanuts will be planted on a trial basis on 22,000 mu.
    The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture held a winter plowing work conference in early October to study technical measures for developing winter oil crops, focusing on increasing yield per unit area, and strengthening specific leadership. At present, all regions are seizing the time to deploy the plan layer by layer. The Yuebei area, which has always had the habit of planting rapeseed, will expand to 650,000 mu this year, an increase of 90% compared to last year. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the area have purchased 340,000 jin of rapeseed seeds, which will be allocated to various counties to meet the needs. In Wengyuan County, five agricultural production cooperatives are preparing to sow rapeseed on the harvested sweet potato fields. In the Leizhou Peninsula, which is located in the subtropical zone, many farmers have begun to trial-plant winter peanuts this year. In Qiongdong County on Hainan Island, some farmers who originally planned to plant watermelons on sandy soil have mostly switched to planting peanuts.

    江西广东两省农民积极扩大冬种面积
    江西省今年计划冬种面积三千万亩，占全省耕地总面积百分之七十三左右，较去年冬种面积扩大了百分之八十一。其中粮食作物扩大百分之一百一十三，油料作物扩大百分之一百一十，绿肥作物扩大百分之五十九点三。
    目前各地农民正积极开展冬耕冬种工作，沿江滨湖地区，为了弥补受灾损失，农民们在洪水退出的田地里，已种上了大麦、小麦、油菜、蚕豆等作物，仍有渍水的地区，也在积极排水抢种。截至十月十五日止，仅九江、彭泽、南昌、永修、余干、鄱阳、进贤、新建等八个重灾县的初步统计，已抢种冬季作物四十多万亩。农民们在搞好冬耕冬种的基础上，并着手为明年春耕生产进行准备工作。

    广东省农民积极扩大冬季油料作物种植面积。全省油菜计划从去年四十四万八千亩基础上扩大到八十七万四千亩。大豆从十四万亩扩大到三十万亩，并试种冬季花生二万二千亩。
    广东省农业厅在十月上旬已召开冬耕工作会议，研究发展冬季油料作物的技术措施，着重提高单位面积产量，并加强具体领导，目前各地已抓紧时间逐层布置。向来有种植油菜习惯的粤北区，今年将可扩大到六十五万亩，比去年增加百分之九十，该区供销合作社已购备油菜种籽三十四万斤，分头调配各县供应需要。翁源县有五个农业生产合作社准备在收获了的蕃薯地上播种油菜籽，地处亚热带的雷州半岛，今年有许多农民开始试种冬季花生，海南岛琼东县有些农民原来准备在砂壤土上种植西瓜的，大多改种花生。
