Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Actively Promotes Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows

    The Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative is actively promoting new-style animal-powered farm tools. In the second half of this year, the province plans to promote 2,800 double-wheel double-share plows, of which more than 680 have already been supplied to farmers. In 1955, the province plans to supply 16,500 double-wheel double-share plows and 1,000 double-wheel single-share plows; a contract has already been signed with the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to order 10,000 double-wheel double-share plows.

    To cooperate with the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative is preparing to supply 5,700 double-wheel double-share plows this winter and spring. A comprehensive promotion will be carried out in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin Special Districts, and key promotions will be carried out in the Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nantong Special Districts. Some areas will first conduct typical demonstrations. At present, the Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transferred more than 150 cadres from the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin Special Districts for short-term training, teaching them how to use the double-wheel double-share plows. In addition, full-time cadres have been sent to Jiangdu, Rugao, Jiangning and other places to teach farmers in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams the techniques of using double-wheel double-share plows.

    The double-wheel double-share plows supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are very popular among farmers. When farmers in Wulizhuang, Huaiyin County, used double-wheel double-share plows to cultivate the land, two or three hundred farmers from nearby villages came to visit. Many farmers in the Xuzhou Special District praised the double-wheel double-share plows for being able to plow deeply, plow evenly, save labor, and be stable. Some farmers even call the double-wheel double-share plow a "small tractor." (Lu Jiannian)

    江苏省供销合作社积极推广双轮双铧犁
    江苏省供销合作社积极推广新式畜力农具。今年下半年，全省计划推广双轮双铧犁二千八百部，现已供应到农民手中的有六百八十多部。一九五五年，全省准备供应双轮双铧犁一万六千五百部、双轮一铧犁一千部；现在已经同北京农业机械厂签订了订制一万部双轮双铧犁的合同。
    配合农业生产互助合作运动的开展，江苏省供销合作社准备在今冬明春供应五千七百部双轮双铧犁。徐州、淮阴专区将进行全面推广，扬州、镇江、南通等专区将重点推广，有些地区先进行典型示范。现在，江苏省供销合作社已从徐州、淮阴专区的供销合作社抽调一百五十多名干部，进行了短期训练，教会了双轮双铧犁的使用方法。另外，还派出专职干部到江都、如皋、江宁等地，向农业生产合作社和互助组的农民传授使用双轮双铧犁的技术。
    各地供销合作社供应的双轮双铧犁，很受农民欢迎。淮阴县五里庄农民用双轮双铧犁耕田时，附近乡村来参观的农民有二、三百人。徐州专区许多农民称赞双轮双铧犁能耕得深，耕得平，又省力，又稳当。有些农民还把双轮双铧犁称呼作“小拖拉机”。（鲁建年）
