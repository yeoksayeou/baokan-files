Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 28th. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu visited the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries on the afternoon of the 25th. The day after the visit, U Nu wrote to Yao Zhongming, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, saying: "The breadth and beauty of the exhibits clearly and unmistakably demonstrate the richness of the Chinese people's cultural traditions. The large number of exquisite designs and lovely variety of styles in each exhibition department is a feast for the eyes. What impressed me particularly deeply were some of the porcelains that constituted the most outstanding and unique effect of the exhibition. I think: the ingenuity of their style and the harmony of their colors are unparalleled. The other exhibits, such as ivory carvings, wood carvings, silverware, silk fabrics, carpets and clay models are also ingenious handicrafts, characterized by unconventional designs and exquisite craftsmanship." U Nu concluded: "I have no doubt that such an exhibition will promote cultural exchanges between our two countries."

    缅甸总理吴努参观我国工艺美术展览会
   【新华社二十八日讯】仰光消息：缅甸总理吴努在二十五日下午参观了中国人民对外文化协会主办的中国工艺美术展览会。吴努在参观后第二天写信给中国驻缅甸大使姚仲明说：“展览品的广泛和优美，明确无误地证明了中国人民文化传统的丰富。每一个展览部门的大量精致的设计和可爱的多种多样的花式，对人们都是一种眼福。给我特别深刻印象的是构成展览会中最出色的、独一无二的效果的一些瓷器。我认为：它们的式样的精巧和色彩的调和是无与伦比的。其他的展览品，像象牙雕刻、木刻、银器、丝织品、地毯和泥制模型也是巧妙的手工艺品，它们的特点是不落俗套的设计和精巧的手艺。”吴努最后说：“我不怀疑，这样的展览会将促进我们两国之间的文化交流。”
