    Agricultural Machine Tractor Stations in Henan Province Expand Area of Cultivation
    Guangdong Province Establishes First Agricultural Machine Tractor Station
    The area of land cultivated for farmers by the six agricultural machine tractor stations in Henan Province is rapidly expanding. This autumn, during the wheat sowing season, the tractor stations cultivated over 14,000 mu of land for 35 agricultural producers' cooperatives. They are now under contract to carry out winter plowing on over 16,000 mu of land. The total area cultivated is more than three and a half times greater than the area cultivated during the summer sowing of autumn crops, and more than nine times greater than the area cultivated by the Bo'ai and Xihua agricultural machine tractor stations last autumn.
    These six agricultural machine tractor stations began cultivating land for farmers after they were established last spring and summer. Thousands of farmers came to observe. The farmers summarized five benefits of machine cultivation: deeper plowing, more thorough turning of the soil, smoother harrowing, straighter drilling, and more uniform seedling emergence. Last autumn, the Bo'ai County Tractor Station planted over 1,700 mu of wheat for five agricultural producers' cooperatives, including Shazhuang in Bo'ai County. The average yield per mu was 57 jin higher than that of wheat cultivated by farmers themselves. In particular, the wheat cultivated by tractor in the Gaozhuang agricultural producers' cooperative more than doubled its yield compared to the previous year. After the Xihua County Tractor Station cultivated the land of the first and second agricultural producers' cooperatives in Nanling Township, Xihua County, it saved over 8,000 labor days within half a year. They used these saved labor days to strengthen field management and accumulate fertilizer, which further guaranteed increased production. Seeing these benefits, farmers actively organized agricultural producers' cooperatives and requested cultivation services. Since this spring, more than ten new agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established in villages near the Xihua County Tractor Station. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Guangdong Province has established its first agricultural machine tractor station.
    This station is located in Shalang Township, Shatian District, Zhongshan County. The tractor station has already signed contracts with four surrounding agricultural producers' cooperatives to cultivate 2,000 mu of land. Several other cooperatives are also preparing to request the station to cultivate approximately 3,000 mu of land. Currently, the first batch of three tractors has been delivered and will begin plowing in early December. Next year, this station will cultivate 16,000 mu of land for nearby farmers.
    The purpose of establishing this agricultural machine tractor station in Guangdong Province is to gain experience in using tractors to cultivate paddy fields, in order to develop tractor stations in paddy field areas on a large scale in the future. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南省的农业机器拖拉机站代耕面积扩大
    广东省建立第一个农业机器拖拉机站
    河南省的六个农业机器拖拉机站给农民代耕的土地面积迅速扩大。今秋种麦时，拖拉机站给三十五个农业生产合作社代耕土地一万四千多亩，现在正按代耕合同给一万六千多亩土地进行冬耕。总计代耕面积比夏天播种秋季作物时扩大三倍半多，比去年秋天博爱、西华两个农业机器拖拉机站代耕的土地面积扩大了九倍多。
    这六个农业机器拖拉机站，在去年春天和今年夏天先后建立后，就开始给农民代耕。曾有成千上万的农民跑来参观。农民给机器耕作总结了五条好处：犁的深，翻的透，耙的平，耩的直，苗出的整齐。博爱县拖拉机站去年秋天给博爱县莎庄等五个农业生产合作社种的一千七百多亩小麦，平均每亩比农民自耕的小麦多收五十七斤。其中，高庄农业生产合作社用拖拉机耕种的小麦，比去年增产一倍多。西华县南凌乡第一、第二两个农业生产合作社的土地由西华县拖拉机站代耕后，半年内就节省了八千多个劳动日；他们利用这些节省下来的劳动日，加强田间管理和积肥，使增产更有了保障。农民看到这些好处，就纷纷组织农业生产合作社，要求代耕。西华县拖拉机站附近乡村的农民，今春以来新建了十多个农业生产合作社。　（新华社）
    广东省已建立了第一个农业机器拖拉机站。
    这个站设在中山县沙田区的沙蓢乡。拖拉机站已和周围四个农业生产合作社签订了代耕二千亩田的合同。另外还有几个社也准备请这个站代耕约三千亩田。现在，第一批三架拖拉机已经运到，下月初就可开机犁田。明年这个站将为附近农民代耕一万六千亩田。
    广东省建立这个农业机器拖拉机站的目的，是要取得用拖拉机耕水田的经验，以便今后大规模发展水田地区的拖拉机站。　（新华社）
