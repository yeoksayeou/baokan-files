Many construction sites in Heilongjiang Province are beginning winter construction, utilizing advanced Soviet winter construction experience. The province's investment in winter construction this year is 4.8 times that of last year, and 80% of the projects under winter construction are metal structure projects and reinforced concrete projects. Most of these projects are factory buildings, and winter construction will allow them to be completed half a year earlier. The Third Construction Site of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry began concrete electric heating construction at the end of October. The concrete mixing plant adopted sand and gravel heating and hot water mixing methods to keep the concrete at a temperature of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, and then used insulated trucks to transport it to various construction sites. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the steam-cured precast concrete slabs shortened the natural curing time by more than 26 days. The Eleventh Construction Site of the Northeast Fifth Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction began pouring the first batch of reinforced concrete foundations at the end of October using the heat storage and insulation method in temperatures of minus 5 degrees Celsius. Since November 1, the Northeast Second Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction has started winter construction on more than 20,000 square meters of projects. The bricklayers of various construction units are actively learning advanced Soviet experience such as the frozen bricklaying method and the mortar bedding method. The workers of the Dongshan Shaft of Hegang Coal Mine have completed the construction of heating plants, mortar mixing plants and other insulation projects, and have begun winter construction.

    More than 100 basic construction projects in Lüda City have largely completed preparations for winter construction.
    The First Construction Engineering Company of Lüda City used oil drums to make more than 100 heating stoves, and also prepared many cloth sheds to protect the construction site from wind and snow. Many construction sites under the leadership of this company have completed plumbing and heating projects in advance, so that when severe cold arrives in Lüda, they can start the heating and carry out construction indoors. The Second Construction Engineering Company of Lüda City has prepared the raw materials needed for winter construction and is actively studying the difficulties that may occur in winter construction and ways to overcome them.
    Many other engineering companies and construction sites have organized employees to study advanced experience in winter construction. Units such as Dalian Civil Engineering Company and the First Construction Engineering Company of Lüda City have studied the Soviet "early strength accelerator grouting method". Using this advanced working method can ensure that concrete can be poured in cold weather of minus 10 degrees Celsius in the future. After learning the "fast three-dimensional bricklaying method," the workers at the "March 8th" Square construction site completed the roofing tiles eight days ahead of schedule, preparing conditions for indoor construction in winter.

    黑龙江省许多建筑工地开始冬季施工
    旅大市基本建设单位进行冬季施工的准备工作
    黑龙江省许多建筑工地运用苏联先进冬季施工经验开始冬季施工。该省今年冬季施工的投资额相当于去年的四点八倍，冬季施工的工程中有百分之八十是金属结构工程和钢筋混凝土工程。这些工程大部是厂房建筑，由于进行冬季施工将提前半年完成。重工业部有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司第三工地，已经在十月末开始用混凝土电气加热法施工，混凝土搅拌厂采用了砂石加热和热水搅拌的方法，使混凝土保持二十至三十度的温度，然后用保温汽车运送到各工地。他们在苏联专家的指导下用蒸汽养生法预制的混凝土板，比自然养生时间缩短二十六天多。建筑工程部东北第五工程公司第十一工地，十月末开始用蓄热保温法在零下五度的气温中浇灌了第一批钢筋混凝土基础。建筑工程部东北第二工程公司从十一月一日起，已有二万多平方公尺的工程开始冬季施工，各个施工单位的瓦工们都积极学习苏联的冻结砌砖法、坐浆砌砖法等先进经验。鹤岗煤矿东山竖井的工人们，已经把加热厂、灰浆搅拌厂等保温工程建筑完毕，开始冬季施工。

    旅大市有一百多项基本建设工程已大体上做好了冬季施工的准备工作。
    旅大市第一建筑工程公司利用油桶做了一百多个取暖用的火炉，还准备了许多布棚，给工地挡风雪。属这个公司领导的不少工地，已提前做好了水暖工程，当严寒降临到旅大的时候，就可以生上暖气在室内施工了。旅大市第二建筑工程公司已经把冬季施工需要的原材料准备就绪，并且积极研究在冬季施工中可能发生的困难和克服这些困难的办法。
    还有不少的工程公司和工地组织职工学习了冬季施工的先进经验，大连土建工程公司和旅大市第一建筑工程公司等单位学习了苏联的“早强促凝剂灌浆法”，使用这一先进工作方法，可以保证将来在零下十度的冷天打混凝土。“三八”广场工地的职工们，在学习“快速立体砌砖法”以后，提前八天砌好房盖瓦，给冬季在室内施工准备了条件。
