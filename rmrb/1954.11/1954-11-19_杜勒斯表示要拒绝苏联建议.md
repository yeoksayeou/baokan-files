Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference that the United States is prepared to reject the Soviet proposal to hold a meeting on European security issues on November 29th. Dulles did not present any major arguments to explain the reasons for the U.S. adopting this attitude, confining himself to saying that "holding a meeting in Moscow or Paris in two weeks is simply impossible."

The "New York Times" regards Eisenhower's request to the Senate on the 15th to approve the Paris Accords as the first indication of the U.S. government's rejection of the Soviet proposal. In an editorial entitled "Reply to the Soviet Union," the newspaper said, "President Eisenhower has submitted the Paris Accords to the Senate, requesting the Senate to study them immediately and approve them quickly when it reconvenes in January next year." The newspaper said: In fact, this is the first official response to the recent Soviet proposal.

    杜勒斯表示要拒绝苏联建议
    【新华社十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上表示：美国准备拒绝苏联关于十一月二十九日就全欧安全问题召开会议的建议。杜勒斯没有提出任何重大的论点来说明美国采取这种态度的理由，而仅限于说“两星期内在莫斯科或巴黎开会，是根本不可能的事情。”
    “纽约时报”把艾森豪威尔十五日要求参议院批准巴黎协定一事看作是美国政府拒绝苏联建议的第一个表示。这家报纸在一篇题为“对苏联的答复”的社论中说：“艾森豪威尔总统已将巴黎协定提交参议院，要求参议院立即予以研究并在明年一月再行开会时迅速批准。”这家报纸说：事实上，这是官方对苏联最近建议的第一个答复。
