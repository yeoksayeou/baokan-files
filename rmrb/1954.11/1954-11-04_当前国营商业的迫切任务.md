    The current urgent task of state-owned commercial departments is to concentrate their efforts, seize the opportunity, overcome difficulties, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the fourth quarter plan, and further, to complete the annual plan.
    State-owned commercial departments must do this not only because the implementation of the state-owned commercial plan has not been good since the third quarter of this year, and only two months remain in 1954, making time pressing, but more importantly because the success or failure of the state-owned commercial plan will have a significant impact on all aspects of the national economy and people's lives.
    In order to strive to complete and overfulfill the fourth quarter plan and complete the annual commercial plan, several erroneous ideas currently existing within the state-owned commercial system must be corrected and clarified.
    Some say, "The fewer planned commodities sold, the better," and "It doesn't matter if the plan isn't completed." Regarding commodities not subject to planned supply and with ample inventory, they also believe, "There's no need for active promotion." It must be pointed out that this idea violates the principle of planned supply, is inconsistent with the Party and the People's Government's policy of satisfying the people's needs as much as possible based on the existing production level, and is incompatible with the basic task of state-owned commerce to serve consumers. It will also foster the development of bureaucracy in supply work. Therefore, this is a very harmful idea.
    When the growth rate of people's consumption exceeds the growth rate of consumer goods production, the state implements planned supply for several major materials in order to guarantee the people's basic needs. The sales plan for commodities listed under planned supply is determined for this purpose, based on China's existing production level and people's consumption level. Although, on the one hand, we cannot exceed the total controlled figures of planned supply, because if the supply exceeds the total control plan, it will affect the rational allocation of such commodities to consumers and the arrangement of commodities; but on the other hand, we cannot think that it doesn't matter if the sales plan for planned supply commodities is not completed, because if the sales task cannot be completed according to the plan, the people's basic needs will not be met, and the accelerated circulation of commodities and the accelerated turnover of funds will also be hindered. For planned supply commodities, we should neither exceed the total planned supply control figures nor fail to complete the sales plan. For planned supply commodities, we must complete the sales plan; for commodities that are not subject to planned supply, we should strive to promote them even more. This is the responsible attitude of state-owned commercial work towards consumers, and the correct implementation of the Party and the People's Government's policies.
    Some say, "The plan cannot be completed without famous brands." As a result, many sales personnel in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are only enthusiastic about promoting a few "famous brands" and are not enthusiastic about promoting many other commodities that meet consumer needs. Because of this, many commodities that should not be out of stock are currently out of stock, and many commodities that meet the needs of rural areas and can be organized for large-scale supply have not yet met with farmers. In fact, because Chinese farmers have rarely bought industrial products in the past, what they need is not entirely famous brands, but durable products. Therefore, the "famous brand" mentality existing among commercial personnel must be corrected, the commodities that meet the needs of farmers must be quickly transported to the countryside, and farmers must be informed of new commodities, so as to satisfy the needs of farmers as much as possible. This can not only effectively support the current purchase of agricultural products, but also play a significant role in withdrawing currency, stabilizing prices, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    On the one hand, state-owned commerce must actively promote industrial and agricultural products, actively introduce new commodities to consumers, and guide consumption, so as to facilitate the rational development of production; on the other hand, it should constantly understand the needs of society and the people, reflect consumers' opinions to the production departments, and promote the production departments to improve production and adapt to market needs. Therefore, sales personnel in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must correct the "famous brand" mentality, actively promote and sell new commodities according to inventory and supply, and expand sales. As for some commodities that do have sales difficulties due to the blind development of industrial departments or because the specifications and quality do not meet the needs of the people, state-owned commercial departments should also inform the industrial departments of these situations and make suggestions for improving production, so as to promote the industrial departments to quickly improve production to meet the needs of the market and the people. At the same time, state-owned commerce and cooperatives should do their best to help promote the existing products.
    State-owned commerce now occupies the main part of the domestic market and has become the leading force in national commercial activities. However, the current research of state-owned commerce on the balance of supply and demand of social commodities is far behind the needs of work development; the unified planning and arrangement of commerce of various economic components are not very thorough, which requires state-owned commercial departments to work hard to improve their policy level and work level to meet the growing needs of the country and the people. Now the main part of industrial product wholesalers has been replaced by state-owned commerce. In this case, state-owned commerce must reasonably distribute the commodities it has mastered and the continuous supply of goods to state-owned retail companies, grassroots cooperatives, retail private merchants, and peddlers. This is not only beneficial to completing the state-owned commercial plan and expanding the circulation of social commodities, but also necessary for supporting the development of cooperative commerce and implementing the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private commerce.
    Of course, completing the annual plan of state-owned commerce this year is not without difficulties. The main reason is that the floods in the summer of this year may have a certain impact on the completion of the annual plan; and the current planning of state-owned commerce is still very poor, which also increases some difficulties in completing the original annual plan. But it must be pointed out that the impact of this year's summer floods on the completion of the annual plan is limited to a certain period, a certain region, and a certain extent; and the shortcomings in planning work can only be overcome by strengthening investigation and research in the practice of actively completing the plan.
    What attitude should state-owned commercial workers take towards the state's plan? Should they bow their heads when encountering difficulties? Or should they do their best to overcome difficulties and realize the country's commercial plan? At present, the majority of staff in the state-owned commercial sector are actively trying to find ways, working hard, and are full of confidence and strength in completing the annual commercial plan; but there are also some staff who lack confidence, lack enthusiasm, and even think that "the plan was not completed in the second and third quarters of this year, and it is inevitable that the annual plan cannot be completed"; "Anyway, the plan cannot be completed, and it is useless to work hard." This erroneous idea is the main obstacle to the completion of the annual plan of state-owned commerce. We must remove these obstacles. Everyone knows that the process of realizing the plan is the process of overcoming difficulties. Only bureaucrats and people who lack enthusiasm for socialist construction want to complete the plan without any effort; and people who are truly enthusiastic about socialist construction fully understand that to complete and overfulfill the state's plan requires a tenacious revolutionary spirit.
    Now, the requisition and unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil and the purchase of other agricultural products have been widely carried out. Although some areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers suffered serious floods this year, because non-disaster areas, which account for 93.4 percent of the country's cultivated land area, have had a bumper harvest, it is estimated that the total grain output for the year may still be slightly higher than last year. On the basis of increased agricultural production, the state's purchase of agricultural products in the fourth quarter will increase compared with the same period last year; a large amount of funds will be put into the countryside, and rural purchasing power will grow rapidly, and the need for industrial products will be more urgent; especially this year, the state has implemented planned supply of cotton cloth, and a considerable part of the purchasing power in rural areas will be transferred to purchasing other industrial products. Therefore, the needs of farmers for industrial products this year are not only large in quantity, but also have a significant increase in variety. This poses a major and glorious task for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce.
    All employees of state-owned commercial departments should realize the significant impact of the success or failure of the state-owned commercial plan on national construction and people's lives, see the favorable factors for completing the annual plan, work hard to overcome difficulties, remove ideological obstacles, mobilize potential forces, closely integrate with cooperatives, hold material exchange meetings widely, organize retail private merchants, vigorously promote sales, strive to complete the annual plan; and lay a good foundation for the work in 1955.

### 当前国营商业的迫切任务

    当前国营商业的迫切任务
    国营商业部门当前的迫切任务，就是集中力量，抓紧时机，克服困难，为完成和超额完成第四季度计划，进而为完成全年计划而努力。
    国营商业部门之所以必须这样做，不仅仅因为今年第三季度以来，国营商业计划执行的情况不好，而一九五四年现在只剩下两个月，时间紧迫；更重要的是国营商业计划执行的好坏，对国民经济生活的各个方面都将发生重大的影响。
    为了争取完成和超额完成第四季度计划，完成全年商业计划，目前存在国营商业系统中的几种错误思想必须加以纠正和澄清。
    有人说：“计划供应的商品越少卖越好”，
  “不完成计划不要紧”，对于不属计划供应、库存尚多的商品，也认为“不必积极推销”。必须指出，这种想法是同计划供应的原则相违背的，是同党和人民政府在现有生产水平的基础上尽可能满足人民需要的政策不符合的，是同国营商业为消费者服务的基本任务不相容的。它还会助长在供应工作上的官僚主义的发展。因此，这是十分有害的思想。
    在人民消费增长速度超过消费品生产增长速度的情况下，国家对于几种主要物资实行计划供应，目的就是为了保证人民的基本需要。列为计划供应的商品销售计划，就是为着这个目的，根据我国现有的生产水平和人民消费水平确定的。虽然，在一方面，我们不能超过计划供应的总控制数字，因为如果供应超出了总的控制计划数字，就将影响到这类商品对消费者的合理分配和商品的安排；但另一方面，我们也不能认为不完成计划供应商品的销售计划是不要紧的，因为如果不能按计划完成销售任务，就满足不了人民的基本需要，同时也阻碍了商品的加速流转和资金的加速周转。对于计划供应的商品我们既不应当超过总的计划供应的控制数字，也不应当不完成销售计划。对于计划供应的商品，我们必须完成销售计划；对于不属于计划供应的商品，更应该努力推销。这才是国营商业工作对消费者负责的态度，才是正确地贯彻了党和人民政府的政策。
    有人说：“没有名牌货就不能完成计划”。于是国营商业、合作社商业的许多营业人员，只热心推销少数“名牌货”，不热心推销适合消费者需要的其他许多商品。由于这样，目前就出现了不少不应脱销的商品脱销了，有不少适合农村需要而又能够大量组织供应的商品还没有和农民见面。事实上，我国农民由于过去很少买工业用品，他们所需要的并不完全是名牌货，他们需要的倒是那种结实耐用的产品。所以，必须纠正存在商业人员中的
  “名牌货”思想，把适合农民需要的商品迅速输送到农村，并且向农民宣传新的商品，尽量满足农民的需要。这不仅能够有效地支援当前农产品的收购，并且，对回笼货币、稳定物价、巩固工农联盟也有重大的作用。
    国营商业一方面必须积极推销工农业产品，并积极地向消费者进行介绍新商品的工作，指导消费，以利生产事业合理的发展；另一方面，应该经常了解社会和人民需要，向生产部门反映消费者的意见，促进生产部门改进生产，适应市场需要。因此，国营商业、合作社商业的营业人员必须纠正“名牌货”思想，根据库存和货源情况，积极宣传和推销新的商品，扩大销售量。至于有些商品，确实由于工业部门盲目发展，或因规格、质量不合人民需要而发生销售困难的情况，国营商业部门也应该把这些情况告诉工业部门，并提出改进生产的建议，促进工业部门迅速改进生产，以适合市场和人民的需要。同时国营商业和合作社对现有的产品还要尽力帮助推销。
    现在国营商业已在国内市场占了主要部分，成为全国商业活动的领导力量。但是，目前国营商业对社会商品供求平衡的研究还远赶不上工作发展的需要；对各种不同经济成分的商业统一计划和安排作得很不周到，这就要求国营商业部门努力提高政策水平和工作水平，以适应国家和人民日益增长的需要。现在工业品批发商的主要部分已由国营商业代替，在这种情况下，国营商业就必须把已掌握的商品和源源不断组织来的货源合理地分配给国营零售公司、基层合作社、零售私商、小贩，这不但对于完成国营商业计划、扩大社会商品流转是有利的，并且也是为了扶助合作社商业的发展、贯彻对私营商业的利用、限制和改造的政策所必需的。
    当然，完成今年国营商业的全年计划不是没有困难的，主要由于今年夏季的水灾，对完成全年计划可能有一定的影响；而目前国营商业的计划性还很差，这也给完成原定的全年计划增加了某些困难。但必须指出，今年夏季水灾对完成全年计划的影响只限于一定的时期，一定的地区，一定程度以内；而计划工作中的缺点只有在积极完成计划的实践中加强调查研究才能克服。
    国营商业的工作人员应当用什么样的态度来对待国家的计划呢？是碰到了困难就低头呢？还是尽最大努力来克服困难，实现国家的商业计划呢？目前，国营商业部门的大多数工作人员，正在积极设法，努力工作，对完成全年商业计划是充满信心和力量的；但也有一部分工作人员信心不足，劲头不大，甚至认为“今年二、三季度没有完成计划，全年计划完不成已是无法避免”；“反正计划完不成了，再努力也没办法”。这种错误的想法，是目前国营商业完成全年计划的主要障碍。我们必须扫除这些障碍。谁都知道，实现计划的过程就是克服困难的过程，只有官僚主义者、对社会主义建设缺乏热忱的人才想不化什么力气就能完成计划；而真正热心于社会主义建设的人都充分了解，要完成和超额完成国家的计划需要有顽强的革命精神。
    现在，粮食、棉花、油料的征收和统购以及其他农产品的收购工作已经普遍开展。今年江淮沿岸部分地区虽然遭受严重的水灾，但因占全国耕地面积百分之九十三、四的非灾区已经丰收，估计全年粮食产量仍可能稍高于去年。在农业增产的基础上，第四季度国家收购农产品的数字比去年同期增加；大量资金投放到农村，农村购买力将迅速增长起来，对于工业品的需要也将更为迫切；特别是今年国家实行了棉布计划供应，农村中购买力相当大的一部分将转移到购买其他的工业品上面去。因此，今年农民对于工业品的需要，不仅是数量大，而且品种也会有显著增加。这就给国营商业和合作社商业提出了重大的光荣的任务。
    国营商业部门的全体职工们，应该认识到国营商业计划执行的好坏，对国家建设和人民生活发生的重大影响，看到目前完成全年计划的有利因素，努力克服困难，扫除思想障碍，动员潜在力量，密切和合作社结合，普遍召开物资交流会，组织零售私商，大力推销，努力完成全年计划；并为一九五五年的工作打下一个良好的基础。
