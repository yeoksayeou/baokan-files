Anhui Province Peasants Enthusiastically Pay Public Grain

The autumn agricultural tax collection work in Anhui Province is progressing smoothly. Currently, the total public grain stored in the province has exceeded 1.1 billion jin. In the four special districts of Anqing, Lu'an, Wuhu, and Chuxian, and the cities of Hefei and Bengbu, the amount of public grain stored has reached over 90% of the total amount to be collected. The 26 counties in the three special districts of Huizhou, Fuyang, and Suxian have basically completed key pilot work. Before the full-scale collection began in these areas, many farmers delivered their public grain to the national granaries in advance.

The vast number of peasants in Anhui Province are extremely enthusiastic about paying public grain this year. The peasants in Changshan Township, Xuan County, paid off 430,000 jin of public grain in one day. Farmers in Xinhua Electoral District, Chengbei Township, Wangjiang County, delivered more than 170,000 jin of public grain in two days, leaving no arrears. When Yongming, Shilang and other townships in Qingxi District, Guichi County, were delivering grain on October 28, they suddenly encountered rain. The grain-delivering farmers automatically took off their clothes to cover the grain, ensuring the safe storage of 60,000 jin of public grain. (Wei Ping)

    安徽省农民踊跃缴公粮
    安徽省农业税秋征工作进展顺利，现在全省入库公粮已经在十一亿斤以上。安庆、六安、芜湖、滁县四个专区的四十二个县和合肥、蚌埠等市入库公粮，已达应征总数的百分之九十以上。徽州、阜阳、宿县三个专区的二十六个县已经基本作好重点试办等工作。这些地区在全面开征以前，就有不少农民提前把公粮送入国家粮库。
    安徽省广大农民今年缴纳公粮极为踊跃。宣城县长山乡农民一天就缴完四十三万斤公粮。望江县城北乡新华选区的农民两天送缴公粮十七万多斤，没有留下尾欠。贵池县清溪区永明、石琅等乡在十月二十八日缴粮的时候，突然遇到下雨，送粮农民自动脱下衣服盖在粮食上，保证了六万斤公粮的安全入库。 （卫平）
