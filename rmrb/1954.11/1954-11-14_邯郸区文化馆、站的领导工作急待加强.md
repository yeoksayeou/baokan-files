To the Editor:

Currently, there are fourteen cultural centers and forty-eight cultural stations in Handan District, Hebei Province, with one hundred and fifty-six people participating in the work of these cultural centers and stations. According to statistics, there are now 492 amateur rural opera troupes and 47 clubs in the district, as well as many radio groups, slideshow groups, book groups, art groups, and writing groups. Over the past few years, they have played a certain role in various major political movements, but there are also many problems. These are mainly reflected in the following aspects: 1. The cultural centers and stations in this district and other cultural work (such as theater troupes, film projection teams, etc.) were originally under the unified leadership of the Culture and Education Sections of the county governments. However, since the leadership focus of the Culture and Education Sections was on education work, the leadership of cultural work was inevitably weakened. Since April of last year, most counties have established independent Cultural Affairs Sections, but most of these Cultural Affairs Sections have not lived up to their responsibility of providing leadership. It is understood that twelve counties in this district have established Cultural Affairs Sections, some of which were established last year, but as of now, the heads of the Cultural Affairs Sections in six counties have not yet taken office. In reality, only one staff member is leading all the cultural work in the county. Some Cultural Affairs Sections have heads, but they are unfamiliar with the cultural work's guidelines, policies, and scope of work, and therefore face many difficulties in their work. 2. The Party committees and governments at all levels in this district have not given due attention to the work of cultural centers and stations. They do not regularly and promptly assign tasks, conduct inspections and supervisions, or pay attention to helping cultural work cadres improve their skills. On the contrary, some leaders believe that cultural propaganda work is dispensable and has little effect. Therefore, not only are cadres of the Cultural Affairs Sections of some counties frequently transferred (such as Li Shaozeng of the Wu'an County Cultural Affairs Section and Liu Cunru of the Yongnian County Cultural Affairs Section, who are frequently transferred to do fixed-point village work), but even cadres of the cultural centers are frequently transferred to fixed-point village work. The heads of cultural centers in Feixiang County, Linzhang, and Cheng'an counties often work in theater troupes, which affects the leadership of the cultural centers and stations. Some counties do not pay attention to quality when allocating cadres to cultural centers and stations. For example, Cixian County transferred an old and infirm judge from the court who was unable to cope with his duties to the county cultural center as director, which resulted in the work failing to progress and generated a lot of complaints from comrades. Some cultural station cadres in the districts were assigned to work as clerks and mail clerks in the district government. 3. The original skill level of the cultural center and station cadres was not high, which led to errors and violations of policies in propaganda work, resulting in adverse consequences.

This backward situation in the work of cultural centers and stations cannot continue. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should pay attention to strengthening its leadership over them, systematically improving the skills of the staff of cultural centers and stations, and promptly correcting the situation of randomly transferring cadres from cultural centers and stations.

　　邯郸区文化馆、站的领导工作急待加强
    编辑同志：河北省邯郸专区目前共有文化馆十四处，文化站四十八处，参加文化馆、站工作的有一百五十六人。据统计现在全区有农村业余剧团四九二个、俱乐部四七个，还有很多的收音组、幻灯组、图书组、美术组、创作组等。几年来他们在各次较大的政治运动中是起了一定的作用，但也存在不少的问题。这主要表现在如下几方面：一、该专区的文化馆、站和其它的文化工作（如剧团、电影队等）原来都是由县政府部门的文教科统一领导的，但由于文教科的领导重点是放在教育工作方面，对文化工作的领导不免有所削弱。从去年四月份绝大部分县都单独建立了文化科，但大部分文化科都没有名符其实地担负起领导的责任来。据了解，这个专区已经建立文化科的有十二个县，有些在去年就建立了，但一直到目前为止还有六个县的文化科长没有到职，全县的文化工作实际上还只是一个科员在领导；有些文化科虽然有了科长，但他们对文化工作的方针、政策，业务范围等等都很生疏，因此，工作上也存在着不少的困难。二、这个专区的各级党委和政府对文化馆、站的工作还未作到应有的重视，他们不能经常地及时地交代任务和进行检查督促，并注意帮助文化工作干部水平的提高，相反地有些领导者却认为文化宣传工作可有可无，作用不大。因此，不仅有些县的文化科干部经常被抽调（如武安县文化科李绍曾、永年县文化科刘存儒经常调做固定村的工作），而且连文化馆的干部也经常被调在固定村工作，肥乡县、临漳、成安等县的文化馆长经常到剧团工作，影响了文化馆、站的领导。有些县在给文化馆、站配备干部时也不重视质量，如磁县将一原在法院工作年老多病无力胜任的审判员，调到该县文化馆任馆长，结果工作开展不起来，同志们的意见也很多。有些区的文化站的干部被分配在区政府做文书、收发等工作。三、文化馆、站的干部原有水平不高，致在宣传工作中发生错误，违反了政策，造成了不好的结果。
    文化馆、站工作的这种落后状况不能再继续下去了。中共邯郸地委应该注意加强对它们的领导，有计划地提高文化馆、站工作人员的水平，迅速纠正随便抽调文化馆、站干部的情况。
