The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture recently held a symposium on the research and design of paddy field plows and initially designed three types of paddy field plows.

In mid-September, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture organized four agricultural implement survey and experiment groups, which went to thirty-eight counties in the province to conduct typical surveys of existing agricultural implements, especially paddy field plows, with a focus on specific areas. At the end of October, the survey groups returned to the province one after another, bringing back the masses' opinions on the improvement of paddy field plows and a lot of information related to the research and design of agricultural implements.

In early November, the Department of Agriculture convened a symposium on the research and design of paddy field plows, gathering representatives of workers, farmers, and handicraftsmen, mechanical engineers, professors and experts in agriculture and agricultural implements, and technicians. The Central-South China Agricultural Science Research Institute and relevant provincial departments also sent people to participate in the meeting.

After detailed research and discussion, the meeting initially designed three types of paddy field plows: one is named the "Jiangxi No. 1" plow. This plow is very simple, can plow to a depth of five to six inches, is more stable and easier to handle than the old plow, and can increase work efficiency by more than 30 percent. Another is to shorten the plow beam of the Type 53 plow to make turning easier without affecting the quality of plowing. The third is the "Jiangxi No. 2" plow, which combines the simple structure of the old plow frame with the plowshare and moldboard of the Type 53 plow, and slightly improves the curvature of the plow surface, making it suitable for both paddy fields and dry land.

At present, the Department of Agriculture has manufactured dozens of paddy field plows based on the design plan of the symposium. In late November, it will organize five more experiment groups to conduct regional experiments and appraisals in key rural areas. It is preparing to finalize the design by the end of the year so that it can begin to promote the new type of paddy field plow.

    江西省农业厅等部门研究设计新式水田犁
    江西省农业厅最近召开了水田犁研究设计座谈会，初步设计出三种水田犁。
    江西省农业厅曾在九月中旬组织四个农具调查试验组，分赴省内三十八个县，有重点地进行旧有农具，特别是水田犁的典型调查。十月底各调查组先后回省，带回了群众对水田犁的改进意见和很多有关农具研究设计的资料。
    十一月上旬，农业厅召集了工人，农民及手工业代表，机械工程师，农业、农具的教授、专家和技术人员等，举行了水田犁研究设计座谈会。中南农业科学研究所和省级有关各部门也派人参加了会议。
    会议经过详细的研究讨论，已初步设计出三种类型的水田犁：一种定名为“江西一号”犁，这种犁很简便，能深耕五寸到六寸，较旧犁平稳好扶，可以提高工作效率百分之三十以上。一种是将五三型犁的犁辕改短，使得转弯方便，并不影响耕作质量。一种是“江西二号”犁，这是采取旧犁犁架的简便结构及五三型犁的犁铧，犁壁，综合为一，并将犁面曲线稍加改进，既能适合水田，又能适合旱地。
    目前农业厅已根据座谈会的设计方案，制造数十部水田犁，将在本月下旬再组织五个试验组重点深入农村进行区域试验和鉴定，准备年底初步定型后，即可展开新式水田犁的推广工作。
