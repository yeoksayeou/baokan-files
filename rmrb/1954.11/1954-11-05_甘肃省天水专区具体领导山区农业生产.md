    Gansu Province Tianshui Special District Specifically Leads Agricultural Production in Mountainous Areas
    This year, the Tianshui Special District of Gansu Province implemented a new method of leading agricultural production by zone and category, further promoting the agricultural production increase movement.
    Over ninety percent of the Tianshui Special District is mountainous, with complex geographical conditions and backward agricultural production technology. Crops and harvest seasons vary from district to district. Before spring plowing this year, the Tianshui Commissioner's Office, based on the agricultural production characteristics of each mountainous area, divided the entire special district into more than ten categories of areas, such as arid mountainous areas, high-altitude cold mountainous areas, river valley areas, areas with sorghum as the main crop, and areas with wheat and corn as the main crops. Representative key townships and villages were established in each type of area. Then, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy departments of the Commissioner's Office jointly formed several work groups, stationed in the key townships and villages of each type of area, and carried out agricultural technical guidance and agricultural capital construction centered on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. After making achievements, cadres and farmers from surrounding villages were organized to visit and learn from the key areas. Since the beginning of spring plowing, work groups in various types of areas have used this method to impart techniques such as using new-style farm tools, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, improving crop rotation systems, and soil and water conservation in mountainous areas to the vast number of cadres and farmers.
    After the Tianshui Special District implemented this leadership method, it first overcame the past phenomenon of issuing generalized instructions detached from reality and promoting experience without considering the target. The district and township cadres in various types of areas quickly clarified the main links in leading agricultural production in their respective areas and found the correct direction for increasing production. For example, the Huajialing mountainous area is sparsely populated, the climate is cold, and there are many natural disasters. Due to the lack of fuel, feed, and fertilizer, half of the farmland is not fertilized, and the draft animals are few and thin. Farmers have to dig up grass roots for fuel every day, which directly affects the development of agricultural production. Due to the general leadership methods adopted in the past, the direction of production development in this type of area has not been found for several years, and the "three shortages" problem cannot be solved. This year, after investigation and research by the work group sent to this mountainous area, and based on the results of experiments in the key areas, it was found that the key to agricultural production increase in this area is to implement a grass (sweet clover) field rotation system, because sweet clover is cold-resistant and drought-resistant, which can solve the "three shortages" problem and increase grain production. Now, this mountainous area is universally promoting the grass field rotation system centered on mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Secondly, the implementation of this new leadership method has also promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of cultivation techniques. After visiting the key areas, the cadres from nine counties including Qin'an and Zhuanglang went back, some led mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives to formulate new agricultural production increase plans, and some farmers joined mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives after visiting. This year, the number of farmers in the entire special district using new-style walking plows and implementing seed mixing, seed selection, strip sowing, and full ridge cultivation has also increased compared with previous years.

    甘肃省天水专区具体领导山区农业生产
    甘肃省天水专区今年实行了一种分区分类领导农业生产的新方法，进一步推动了农业增产运动。
    天水专区百分之九十以上是山区，地理情况很复杂，农业生产技术落后，各区农作物及收获季节都不相同。今年春耕前，天水专员公署根据各山区的农业生产特点，把全专区划分成干旱山区、高寒山区、川道区、以高粱为主要农作物区、以小麦、玉米为主要农作物区等十多类地区，在每一类地区建立了有代表性的重点乡、村。然后由专员公署的农、林、牧、水利部门联合组成若干工作组，常驻各类地区的重点乡、村，以互助合作组织为中心，进行农业技术指导和农业基本建设。作出成绩后，再组织周围乡村的干部和农民到重点区去参观学习。自春耕开始以来，各类地区的工作组使用这种方法，向广大干部和农民传授了使用新式农具、防治病虫害、改进轮作制度、山区水土保持等技术。
    天水专区实行这种领导方法后，首先克服了过去脱离实际的发布一般化指示、不看对象的推广经验的现象，各类地区的区乡干部很快明确了领导各该地区农业生产的主要环节，找出正确的增产方向。例如华家岭山区地广人稀，气候寒冷，自然灾害很多，因燃料、饲料、肥料都缺，有一半农田不施肥，耕畜又少又瘦，农民每天要铲草根做燃料，直接影响农业生产的发展。由于过去采取一般化领导方法，几年来始终未找出这类地区发展生产的方向，“三缺”问题不能解决。今年经过派到这个山区的工作组调查研究，并在重点区实验结果，发现这个区农业增产的关键是实行草（草木樨）田轮作制度，因草木樨耐寒耐旱，既能解决“三缺”问题，又能增产粮食。现在这个山区正在以互助合作组织为中心，普遍推广草田轮作制度。其次，实行这种新的领导方法还推动了互助合作运动和耕作技术的改进，秦安、庄浪等九县观摩了重点区的干部回去后，有的就领导互助组或农业生产合作社制订新的农业增产计划，有些农民参观以后就参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。今年全专区使用新式步犁，实行拌种、选种、条播和满垄耕作的农民，也比往年增多。  （新华社）
