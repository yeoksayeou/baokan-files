A Letter from Zeng Wenchang, a Model Worker of Yunnan Province's Industry, to Soviet Workers

Dear Soviet Worker Comrades:

    I am the duty officer of the Gejiu Malage Tin Mine of the Yunnan Tin Industry Company. With the help of Soviet experts, our tin mine's production is increasing day by day. The miners, accepting the experts' advice, have adopted new mining methods, increasing mining efficiency from 2,000 kilograms of tin ore per person per shift to over 4,000 kilograms. We have overfulfilled the state plan every month and reduced costs by 50%. By adopting this new operating method, the mine's working face has been further expanded, and production has become safer. Every worker has personally seen the benefits of learning from Soviet advanced technology and implementing the experts' recommendations, and is working hard to learn and promote this new operating method.

    Although our Gejiu mine is not yet fully mechanized and automated, some mines use various machines supported by you, such as wind drills, electric locomotives, and slag tipping machines, which have freed us from heavy manual labor. What particularly excites the mining workers of our Malage Tin Mine is that the Malage Tin Mine once suffered from resource "poverty," and many people thought there were no more resources underground. In the first half of last year, geological experts sent by you came to our mine for detailed surveys and proved that our mine still contains rich tin deposits. Following the direction they indicated for exploration, we found many resources. Mines that were once considered to be abandoned can now have their lifespan extended by forty years. This is equivalent to finding a new mine for our country and adding a new mine. How can this not cause us to feel boundless gratitude to you and the experts!

    Dear friends, thanks to your friendly assistance, the face of the Gejiu Tin Mine has undergone profound changes. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the lives of our miners were just like the tragic life experienced by the old miner Nie Daolian in your film "Donbass Miners" fifty years ago. Our workers had no personal freedom, and hunger, unemployment, and death constantly threatened us. We spent all day crawling in narrow and small mines, carrying heavy tin ore, and many people got sick as a result, and were even tortured to death. After liberation, that beastly life is gone forever. Today, we have moved from dark and small thatched huts into newly built buildings. Workers' hostels, workers' cultural palaces, spare-time schools, sanatoriums, and recuperation centers are also being built. Our lives have been greatly improved, and workers' families have generally added new clothes and utensils. After work, our group's workers can hear voices broadcast from Moscow and Beijing from the three radios awarded to us by the government and the trade union.

    Dear friends, on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we extend our warm congratulations to you. We are determined to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve labor productivity, and strive to consolidate and develop the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

### 云南省工业劳动模范曾文昌给苏联工人的信

    云南省工业劳动模范曾文昌给苏联工人的信亲爱的苏联工人同志：
    我是云南锡业公司个旧马拉格锡矿的值班主任。我们的锡矿在苏联专家的帮助下，生产一天比一天提高。采矿工人接受了专家的建议，使用了新的采矿方法，采矿效率由过去每人每班采矿砂两千公斤提高到四千公斤以上，月月超额完成了国家计划，并且降低了成本百分之五十。由于采用了这个新的操作方法，矿井的采矿工作面更加扩大，生产更加安全了。每个工人亲眼看到学习苏联先进技术、贯彻专家的建议的好处，都努力学习和推广这个新的操作方法。
    我们个旧矿山，虽然还没有完全机械化、自动化，但有的矿使用了你们支援我们的风镐、电机关车、翻渣机等各种机械，使我们从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来了。特别使我们马拉格锡矿采矿工人感到兴奋的是：马拉格锡矿曾一度闹资源“贫乏”，很多人都以为井下没有资源了。去年上半年，你们派来的地质专家来到我们矿山，进行了详细勘察，证明我们的矿山还埋藏着丰富的锡矿。按照他们所指引的方向进行勘探，我们找到了很多资源。过去认为将废弃的矿井，现在还能够延长四十年的寿命。这就等于给我们国家找到了一个新矿，增加了新矿井。这怎么能不引起我们对你们和专家的无限感激呢！
    亲爱的朋友们，由于你们友谊的帮助，已使个旧锡矿的面貌起了深刻的变化。在国民党反动派的统治时期，我们矿工的生活，正像你们的影片
  “顿巴斯矿工”中老矿工聂道连，在五十年前所遭遇的悲惨生活一样。我们工人没有人身自由，饥饿、失业、死亡随时在威胁我们。我们成天在又狭又小的矿井里，匍匐着运出沉重的矿砂，很多人都因此得到疾病，甚至被折磨死了。解放后，那种牛马般的生活一去不复返了。今天，我们已经从阴暗矮小的茅草屋，搬进了新建的楼房。工人招待所、工人文化宫、业余学校、疗养院、休养所等也正在着手建筑。我们的生活已大大改善，工人家庭都普遍增添了新衣和用具。我们小组的工人，每当工作完毕后，就可从政府和工会奖给我们的三部收音机里，听到莫斯科、北京播出来的声音。
    亲爱的朋友们，在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年到来的时候，我们谨向你们致热烈的祝贺。我们决心进一步学习苏联先进经验，提高劳动生产率，为巩固和发展中苏的伟大友谊而努力。
    云南省工业劳动模范　曾文昌
