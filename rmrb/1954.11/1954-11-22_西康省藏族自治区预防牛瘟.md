The veterinary epidemic prevention personnel in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province are carrying out rinderpest prevention work in various pastoral areas. In September and October, more than 194,600 cattle have been vaccinated in Shiqu, a purely pastoral county, and Dengke, a semi-pastoral county. Cattle that have been vaccinated can be protected from rinderpest for a year and a half.

In order to effectively prevent and gradually eradicate rinderpest in the future, the animal husbandry and veterinary departments of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province have negotiated and formulated joint rinderpest prevention measures this year, exchanging epidemic prevention plans, information, and work experience, and providing mutual support in terms of manpower, medicines, and equipment when necessary.

    西康省藏族自治区预防牛瘟
    西康省藏族自治区的兽疫防治人员正在各牧区进行牛瘟预防工作。九、十两月里，在纯牧区的石渠和半牧区的邓柯两县，已预防注射了十九万四千六百多头牛。经过预防注射的牛，可以在一年半内不发生牛瘟。
    为了今后有效地进一步地防治和逐步扑灭牛瘟，今年西康省藏族自治区和青海省玉树藏族自治区的畜牧兽防部门协商订立牛瘟联合防治办法，互相交换防疫计划、情况和工作经验，必要时并进行人力药械上的互相支援。（新华社）
