Heilongjiang Province Farmers
　　Massive Reserves of Livestock Feed

Heilongjiang farmers are collecting and storing various livestock feeds in large quantities to save grain. According to statistics from thirty-three counties, more than 6.64 billion jin of grass have been cut this year, enough for more than 1.3 million horses to eat for a year. Farmers in Jianguo Village, Longjiang County, have now stored 650,000 jin of feed such as sorghum husks and corn cobs. If these feeds are used to feed horses and pigs, the village can save more than 140,000 jin of grain and 160,000 jin of bran. Farmers in Yuhe Village, Yanshou County, have stored 130,000 jin of feed such as flax chaff and sunflower heads, which can feed more than 480 pigs in the village for four to five months. Mingshui County plans to promote thirteen kinds of feed such as corn stalks and sorghum husks throughout the county to replace grain for feeding livestock, requiring each farmer to save 450 jin of grain, so the county can save nearly 10 million jin of grain.

    黑龙江省农民
    大量储备牲畜饲料
    黑龙江农民为了节省粮食，大量采集和储备各种牲畜饲料。据三十三个县的统计，今年已打了六十六亿四千多万斤草，够一百三十多万匹马吃一年。龙江县建国村农民现已储备了六十五万斤高粮壳、玉米瓤等饲料，如将这些饲料喂马、喂猪，全村即可节省十四万多斤粮食，十六万斤糠。延寿县玉和村农民已储蓄了亚麻糠、向日葵头等饲料十三万斤，可供全村四百八十多头猪吃四五个月。明水县计划在全县推广玉米秸、高粱壳等十三种饲料代替粮食喂牲畜，要求每户农民节省四百五十斤粮食，这样全县即可节省粮食近一千万斤。 （达林）
