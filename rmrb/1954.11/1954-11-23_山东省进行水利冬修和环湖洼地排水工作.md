Shandong Province is Intensively Carrying Out Winter Water Conservancy Construction and Drainage of Low-lying Areas Around Lakes.

This year, Shandong Province has 105 winter water conservancy projects. These include river diversion, dredging, irrigation, and siphonage projects. In addition, there are 252 bridges, culverts, gates, and dams, and 750 slow-water dams. These projects involve a total excavation of 6.96 million cubic meters of earthwork. By the beginning of October, 32 projects had already started. Among them, the earthwork portion of the Zuyang County Nanquan self-flowing irrigation project and other projects have been fully completed, and the foundation portions of the major buildings have also been basically completed.

During the flood season in Shandong, the waterlogged area in low-lying areas was 5.43 million mu. By the end of September, 4.89 million mu had been drained, and wheat was sown in these areas in a timely manner. In the low-lying areas of Dezhou, Liaocheng, Heze, and Jining, another 260,000 mu have been drained to date, and they are also guaranteeing the replanting of winter wheat in these areas. There are still 190,000 mu that have not been drained. Although most of them are low-lying areas around lakes or dead low-lying areas, the local Party and government are still trying their best to drain the accumulated water as soon as possible to strive for planting spring wheat next spring.

    山东省进行水利冬修和环湖洼地排水工作
    山东省紧张进行水利冬修和环湖洼地排水工作。
    今年山东省的水利冬修工程，共有一百零五项。其中包括河流导治、疏浚、灌溉、虹吸引水等工程。此外尚有桥、涵、闸、坝二百五十二座，缓水坝七百五十座。这些工程共挖土方六百九十六万公方。到十月上旬已经开工的工程有三十二项。其中徂阳县南泉自流灌溉等工程的土方部分已全部竣工，各主要建筑物的基础部分也基本结束。
    山东汛期洼地积水面积，有五百四十三万亩。到九月底已排出四百八十九万亩，并在这些地区适时地播种了小麦。德州、聊城、菏泽、济宁地区的洼地积水，到目前为止，又排出二十六万亩，他们并保证在这些地区补种冬小麦。现在未能排除的还有十九万亩，虽多是环湖洼地或死洼地，但当地的党和政府还尽量设法把积水及早排出，争取明春播种春小麦。　　　（本报山东记者站）
