Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 2nd: Prominent Indonesian figures who recently returned from visits to China enthusiastically shared what they witnessed firsthand in People's China.

Professor Priyono, Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Indonesia, told an Antara News Agency reporter, "The moment my foot stepped on the soil of New China, I immediately felt the atmosphere of peace." He said he was deeply moved by the Chinese people's spirit of peaceful construction, their optimistic attitude, and their full confidence in their bright future. Modern buildings, new factories, hospitals, sanatoriums, workers' residences, and government office buildings are springing up everywhere in China. He said that New China's construction is being carried out on a large scale with a spirit of competition, at a high speed and with high quality. In China, hard work is not a disadvantage, but a great honor. For example, in building an art academy in Beijing, both professors and students participated in the project.

Priyono pointed out that in China, robbers, thieves, and even beggars are almost non-existent, which must be the result of the economic and educational systems. He said that Chinese artists, scholars, and writers are highly respected, and their lives are fully guaranteed.

After visiting Anshan, the steel center, and other industrial areas, Priyono's impression was that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is indeed close and sincere, with no suspicion between them. He particularly mentioned that Soviet experts in China have helped China train many specialists in various fields to manage their own industries.

Priyono told "Newspaper" reporters on October 19th that it is natural for China to liberate Taiwan. He pointed out that Taiwan has become a base for the United States to infringe upon the peaceful life of the Chinese people.

Muhammed Said, editor-in-chief of the Medan newspaper "Alert," told the press on October 29th that the government of the People's Republic of China is supported by the Chinese people, and its policies and measures are based on the will of the people, which is why it has achieved so many accomplishments. He added that it is indeed possible to predict that these achievements will continue to develop.

Based on what he saw in China's heavy industry, Said said that the Soviet Union's assistance to China is sincere and selfless.

Dia, editor-in-chief of "Independent Newspaper," said on October 20th that as an Asian, he was very happy to see China's progress. Previously, China was a colonized country, known for corruption, warlordism, and the poverty of its people. Now, all these phenomena have disappeared. He said that the Chinese government is indeed supported by the people.

Dia said that China does not want war. China has vast lands. The Chinese people want to build their motherland. They want peace.

Dia also pointed out that the Chinese people have established their self-confidence. Their spirit of fighting for a bright future has opened the eyes of the people of other Asian countries.

    印度尼西亚著名人士发表访华观感
    【新华社雅加达二日电】刚从中国访问回来的印度尼西亚著名人士热烈地讲述了他们在人民中国亲眼看见的情况。
    印度尼西亚大学文学院院长普里约诺教授对安塔拉通讯社记者说：“我的脚一踏上新中国的土地，我就马上感觉到和平的气氛。”他说，他对于中国人民的和平建设精神、乐观的态度以及对他们的光明前途所怀的充分信心十分感动。现代建筑、新工厂、医院、休养所、工人住宅以及政府机关办公大楼，在中国到处矗立起来了。他说，新中国的建设是以竞赛的精神在大规模的基础上进行的，速度很快，质量很高。在中国，勤劳工作并不是吃亏的，而是一种很大的荣誉。例如，在北京建筑一个艺术学院，教授和学生都参加了这个工程。
    普里约诺指出，在中国，强盗、小偷甚至连乞丐都差不多全没有了，这一定是经济制度以及教育制度所造成的结果。他说，中国艺术家、学者和作家受到很大的尊重，他们的生活得到了充分的保障。
    普里约诺在钢铁中心鞍山和其他工业地区参观后所得的印象是：中苏友谊的确是亲密诚挚的，相互之间一点猜疑都没有。他特别提到，在中国的苏联专家帮助中国训练了许多各方面的专门人材，来管理自己的工业。
    普里约诺在十月十九日告诉“新报”记者说，中国要解放台湾，是很自然的事。他指出：台湾已成为美国用来侵犯中国人民的和平生活的基地。
    棉兰报纸“警惕报”总编辑穆罕默德·赛义德十月二十九日对报界说，中华人民共和国政府是得到中国人民的支持的，它的政策和措施是基于人民的意志的，这就是它所以取得那么多成就的原因。他又说，确实可以这样预言：这些成就将继续发展下去。
    赛义德根据在中国看到的重工业的情况说，苏联对中国的帮助是真诚和无私的。
    “独立报”总编辑迪亚十月二十日说，作为一个亚洲人，他看到中国的进步时感到非常高兴。以前，中国是一个殖民地化的国家，以贪污腐败、军阀割据和人民穷困而出名。现在，所有这些现象已一去不复返了。他说，中国政府的确得到人民的支持。
    迪亚说，中国不要战争。中国有着广大的土地。中国人民要建设他们的祖国。他们要和平。
    迪亚并指出，中国人民已建立了他们的自信心。他们为光明的前途而斗争的精神，使其他亚洲国家人民打开了眼界。
