    Grain Procurement Work in Heilongjiang Province About to Fully Unfold
    Broad Masses of Farmers Actively Sell Surplus Grain to the State
    The grain procurement work in Heilongjiang Province is about to fully unfold, and the broad masses of farmers are increasingly enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state.
    After the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial grain work conference in mid-November, more than 40 cadres were drawn from the Grain Bureau and other relevant departments to form a grain procurement office, headed by Yang Yichen, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, to lead the province's grain procurement work. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is also preparing to transfer more than 200 cadres from provincial-level agencies to assist in carrying out the work in various counties in the near future. In order to implement the spirit of the provincial grain work conference, the counties have been successively holding conferences attended by cadres at the county, district, and village levels, as well as labor models and activists, since November 20th. Before convening the meetings, the counties generally sent out work teams to investigate grain production in typical villages. At the meetings, many counties adopted various vivid and effective methods to conduct in-depth education on the significance of grain procurement and the grain purchase and supply policy. During the conference, Anda County organized a picture exhibition to specifically illustrate the prospects of the national Five-Year Construction Plan and the benefits of unified purchase and sale. Acheng and other counties are preparing to invite agricultural labor models who have visited factories to talk about the significance of selling grain to support national industrial construction. Suihua, Hulan and other counties will commend model figures who actively sold grain last year at the meeting. After these meetings, under the leadership and promotion of the broad masses of cadres and activists, the province's grain procurement work will be enthusiastically launched.
    Since the autumn harvest, the broad masses of farmers throughout the province have begun to sell their surplus grain to the state. The members of 14 agricultural production cooperatives, including Xinfeng, Hongguang, Xingguang, and Fuyuan in the Eighth District of Wuchang County, decided at the beginning of threshing that surplus grain would not be stored in warehouses, but would be sold directly to the state collectively. They have now sold more than one million catties of rice to the state. Farmers in Guangrong Village, the Second District of Hailun County, which won the honorary title of "Grain Selling Model Village" last year, put forward the slogan "Haul quickly, thresh quickly, save grain, sell more grain to the state, and maintain glory" at the beginning of the autumn harvest. Communist Youth League member Gao Lin said: "I will use the grain I grow with my own hands to support national industrial construction and support the liberation of Taiwan." In the four or five days after threshing began, the whole village sold more than 12,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. The "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Bayan County suffered a flood last year. During the summer hoeing period this year, when the members were short of food rations, the government supplied them with more than 10,000 catties of grain to help them carry out summer hoeing in a timely manner, resulting in a bumper harvest. From these facts, the members deeply realized the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain. Gao Tong, the director of the cooperative, said: "If the state had not implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain this year, and controlled the grain, and supplied us with grain in a timely manner, someone would have engaged in grain speculation to exploit us at that critical moment. We have achieved a bumper harvest with the help of the state, and we must sell the surplus grain to the state." All the members decided that, in addition to selling more than 243,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, they would also save 12,000 catties of grain from pig and horse feeding to sell to the state. Now, the amount of surplus grain sold by farmers throughout the province to the state is increasing day by day. From the time autumn grain was put on the market to November 18th, more than 270,000 tons of grain have been purchased in various places.

    黑龙江省征粮购粮工作即将全面展开
    广大农民积极向国家出卖余粮
    黑龙江省征粮购粮工作即将全面展开，广大农民正日益踊跃地向国家出售余粮。
    中共黑龙江省委会在十一月中旬召开全省粮食工作会议以后，从粮食厅等有关部门抽调四十多名干部成立了征粮购粮办公室，由省人民政府副主席杨易辰任主任，领导全省征粮购粮工作。中共黑龙江省委还准备在最近从省级机关抽调二百多名干部派到各县协助开展工作。各县为了贯彻全省粮食工作会议的精神，从十一月二十日起正相继召开县、区、村三级干部和劳动模范、积极分子等参加的会议。各县在召开会议以前，一般都派出工作组，到典型村调查了粮食产量。会议上，许多县采用了各种生动有效的方式，深入地进行关于购粮意义、购粮政策的教育。安达县在会议期间组织了一个图片展览会，用图片来具体说明国家五年建设计划的远景和统购统销的好处。阿城等县准备请参观过工厂的农业劳动模范讲述卖粮对支援国家工业建设的意义。绥化、呼兰等县将在会上表扬去年积极卖粮的模范人物。开过这些会议以后，在广大干部、积极分子的领导、推动下，全省征粮购粮工作即可热烈展开。
    从秋收以来，全省广大农民就开始纷纷向国家出售余粮。五常县第八区新丰、红光、星光、富源等十四个农业生产合作社的社员们，在开始打场的时候，就作出决定：余粮不入仓，直接集体卖给国家。现在他们已经把一百多万斤稻谷卖给国家。去年获得“售粮模范村”光荣称号的海伦县第二区光荣村的农民，在秋收刚开始的时候就提出了“快拉，快打，节约粮食，多向国家卖粮，保持光荣”的口号。青年团员高林说：“我要用亲手种出来的粮食，支援国家工业建设，支援解放台湾。”全村在开始打场以后的四、五天当中，就卖给国家一万二千多斤余粮。巴彦县第三区“五一”农业生产合作社去年遭受了水灾，今年夏锄期间，社员们正缺口粮的时候，政府供应给他们一万多斤粮食，帮助他们及时进行了夏锄，使庄稼获得丰收。社员们从这些事实中，深切体会到粮食统购统销的好处。社主任高桐说：“今年要不是国家实行粮食统购统销，掌握了粮食，及时供应我们吃粮，在那个节骨眼的时候，准会有人搞粮食投机来剥削我们。我们在国家帮助下得到了丰收，一定要把余粮卖给国家。”全体社员决定，除了把二十四万三千多斤余粮卖给国家以外，还要从喂猪、喂马等方面节约一万二千斤粮食卖给国家。现在，全省农民向国家出售余粮的数量一天比一天增加，从秋粮上市到十一月十八日止，各地已收购了二十七万多吨粮食。
