Xinhua News Agency report: In October, sixty-eight state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the capital completed their state production plans. These include the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Jingxi Mining Bureau, Liulihe Cement Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory, Beijing People's Printing Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and other major factories and mines. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant has even completed its annual state production plan ahead of schedule.

The factory competition launched in October by many factories and mines has played a significant role in completing the state production plan. In order to ensure more iron output from the blast furnace, the workers of the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, after completing the repair task of two small blast furnaces ahead of schedule, also completed the task of repairing the cast iron machine, which required forty-eight hours, nine hours ahead of schedule. The workers of the Coking Department, repairing the carbonization chambers of three furnaces, completed the task twenty-one hours and fifty minutes ahead of schedule, and the quality met the standards. Therefore, the main products of the steel plant in October, such as pig iron, coke, and cast pipes, all overfulfilled the state production plan. The five major workshops of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant have created 178 new records exceeding the quota by more than 50%. The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which was newly put into production, not only completed the state production plan for yarn and cloth in October ahead of schedule, but also increased the rate of first-class cloth from the national plan of 98% to 98.89%.

    十月份厂际竞赛获得良好效果
    首都六十八个厂矿完成生产计划
    据新华社讯：十月份首都有六十八个国营和地方国营厂矿完成了国家生产计划。其中包括石景山钢铁厂、京西矿务局、琉璃河水泥厂、石景山发电厂、北京第一棉纺织厂、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、北京人民印刷厂、清河制呢厂等主要厂矿。北京农业机械厂并已提前完成了全年国家生产计划。
    十月份许多厂矿开展厂际竞赛后，对完成国家生产计划起了很大作用。石景山钢铁厂为了保证高炉多出铁，炼铁部工人在提前完成了两座小高炉的检修任务后，又提前九小时完成了需要四十八小时的修理铸铁机的任务。炼焦部工人中修三座炉子的炭化室，提前二十一小时五十分钟完成了任务，且质量都合乎标准。因此，钢铁厂十月份的生铁、焦炭、铸管等主要产品都超额完成了国家生产计划。北京农业机械厂的五个主要车间连创一百七十八件超过定额百分之五十以上的新纪录。新投入生产的国营北京第一棉纺织厂除提前完成了十月份纱、布的国家生产计划外，正布率已由国家计划百分之九十八，提高到百分之九十八点八九。
