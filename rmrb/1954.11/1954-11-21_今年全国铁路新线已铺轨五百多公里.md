Railway projects such as the Jining-Erlian railway, the Fengtai-Shacheng section, and the Yakeshi-Yalin railway have all overfulfilled their plans. By November 10, 514 kilometers of newly built railways had been paved and were open to construction trains. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway had been paved past Qilibu on the 18th, reaching 279 kilometers, and will soon be paved to Wuwei, an important town in Hexi; the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway had been paved past Baolunyuan on the 16th, reaching 300 kilometers; and the Jining-Erlian Railway had been paved past Ulahot Temple on the 18th, reaching 287 kilometers.
    Recently, the New Railway Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways issued instructions, requiring all construction departments to carefully analyze and study the projects yet to be completed, formulate specific measures, meticulously organize forces, and seize the time for winter construction; and particularly pointed out that during the period of intense project work, it is necessary to strictly prevent phenomena such as neglecting quality, disregarding safety, and ignoring costs. At present, all railway construction workers are actively advancing with full confidence to comprehensively fulfill the state plan.

    今年全国铁路新线已铺轨五百多公里
    【本报讯】全国新建铁路工程正在加速进行。进入第四季度以来，各线筑路工人进一步展开劳动竞赛，工作效率大大提高。十月份全国新建铁路施工部门完成月度计划百分之一○○·一，比九月份提高了百分之四七·二，这是今年以来施工情况最好的一个月。据初步统计，到十月底新线工程已完成全年计划的百分之七一·五。十一月份上旬新线施工计划也完成得很好，如集二线、丰沙段、牙林线等铁路工程都超额完成了计划。到十一月十日，今年新建铁路已铺轨并通行工程列车的有五百一十四公里。兰新路在十八日已铺轨过七里堡，到达二百七十九公里处，很快就要铺到河西重要城镇——武威；宝成路南段在十六日已铺轨过宝轮院，到达三百公里处；集二线在十八日已铺轨过乌拉火特庙，到达二百八十七公里处。
    最近铁道部新建铁路工程总局发出指示，要求各施工部门对尚待完成的工程认真分析研究，制定具体措施，周密地组织力量，抓紧进行冬季施工；并特别指出在工程紧张期间要严防忽视质量、轻视安全和不计成本等现象发生。目前，全体筑路职工正满怀信心地为全面完成国家计划而积极前进中。
