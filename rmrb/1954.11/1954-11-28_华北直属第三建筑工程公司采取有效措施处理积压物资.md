    North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company Takes Effective Measures to Handle Overstocked Materials
    A letter from North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company: The short commentary "Overcoming the Phenomenon of Overstocking and Waste of State Materials" published on page two of the People's Daily on October 6th criticized our company's overstocking of materials; this criticism is entirely consistent with the facts. The reason for this situation, as pointed out in the short commentary, is that the leaders of our enterprise only pursued project progress, and the general materials staff also unilaterally emphasized ensuring supply, resulting in a top-down neglect of the planned management of materials and equipment.

    In recent months, although we have taken some measures to dispose of overstocked and defective materials worth more than 1.577 billion yuan, and strengthened the planned management of materials; judging from the overall situation, our attention to this issue is still insufficient, and the phenomenon of overstocking still exists. The People's Daily's criticism is a great impetus for us. We have already organized an overstocked materials disposal team, led personally by responsible cadres, to conduct in-depth inspections of the overstocked materials in the warehouse and formulate disposal plans. We have also convened a materials balance meeting of the company's subordinate work areas, construction sites, warehouses, equipment engineering teams, etc., to handle overstocked materials.

    We have decided to earnestly study advanced Soviet experience, overcome the supply system mentality and capitalist business ideology, so as to improve enterprise management, strengthen planned management, conscientiously grasp planned supply, and strictly implement the material requisition and return system, so as to prevent the phenomenon of overstocking of materials from continuing to occur.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    华北直属第三建筑工程公司采取有效措施处理积压物资
    华北直属第三建筑工程公司来信：十月六日人民日报二版发表了“克服积压和浪费国家物资的现象”的短评，批评了我公司积压材料的现象；这个批评完全合乎事实。造成这种情况的原因，正如短评中指出的，是我们企业领导人员只追求工程进度，一般材料工作人员也是片面强调保证供应，以致自上而下的忽视材料设备的计划管理工作。
    近几个月来，我们虽然已经采取一些措施，处理了价值十五亿七千七百多万元的积压残废材料，加强了材料的计划管理工作；但从整个情况来看，我们对这个问题的重视还是不够的，积压现象仍然存在。人民日报的批评，对我们是个很大的督促。我们已经组织了积压材料处理小组，由负责干部亲自领导，深入仓库现场检查积压材料情况，拟出处理方案。并召开了公司所属各工区、工地、仓库、设备工程队等的物资平衡会议，来处理积压材料。
    我们决定要认真学习苏联先进经验，克服供给制思想和资本主义经营思想，以提高企业管理水平，加强计划管理工作，认真掌握计划供应，严格执行领退料制度，以防止积压物资的现象继续发生。
