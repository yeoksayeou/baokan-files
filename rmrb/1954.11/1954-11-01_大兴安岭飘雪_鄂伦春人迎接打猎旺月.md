    Snow Falls in the Greater Khingan Range
    Oroqen People Welcome the Peak Hunting Month
    In October, snow has fallen for several days in a row in the Greater Khingan Range. The Oroqen hunters of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have prepared their guns, bullets, and gunpowder for winter hunting, welcoming the arrival of the peak hunting month.
    In the deep mountains and dense forests within the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, there are various wild animals such as lynx and squirrels. Every year during the snowfall season, the hunters go to the mountains to hunt wild animals. Thanks to the leadership of the Autonomous Banner People's Government in organizing hunting production, the income of hunters has increased year after year. Last year, the income of hunters throughout the banner from selling animal skins and mountain products increased by more than 12 percent compared to 1952. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大兴安岭飘雪
    鄂伦春人迎接打猎旺月
    十月间，大兴安岭上已接连飘了好几天的雪花，内蒙古自治区鄂伦春自治旗鄂伦春族的猎民们，已准备好冬天打围的枪枝、子弹和火药，迎接打猎旺月的到来。
    在鄂伦春自治旗境内的深山密林中，有猞猁、灰鼠等各种野兽，每年落雪时期，猎民们就到山间追猎野兽。由于自治旗人民政府领导猎民有组织地进行打猎生产，使猎民的收入连年增加。去年全旗猎民出卖兽皮、山货等的收入，就比一九五二年增加了百分之十二多。　（新华社）
