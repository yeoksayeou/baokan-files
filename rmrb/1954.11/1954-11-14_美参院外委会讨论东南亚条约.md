Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th -- TASS Washington, 12th: The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee began public discussions on the Southeast Asia Treaty on the 11th. The US government submitted this treaty to the Senate for approval on the 10th.

    US Secretary of State Dulles first made an informal statement. He stated that the United States is prepared to convene a meeting of countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty, regardless of whether the treaty comes into effect, to discuss ways to combat the "threat of subversive activities" in the region.

    Dulles said that the United States should have "mobile strike forces" in Southeast Asia. He also said that the economic provisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty do not obligate the United States to implement any "large-scale economic assistance" plan.

    Dulles requested that the Senate approve the treaty as quickly as possible. According to him, this treaty is a "major step" for the United States in realizing its Far East policy.

    It is clear from the course of the meeting that the Senate does not intend to approve the Southeast Asia Treaty during the current special session, but to postpone it until the Eighty-Fourth Congress begins its session in January next year.

    In response to questions from senators, Dulles said that "a chaotic situation has been created" in South Vietnam "because South Vietnam does not have an effective government." He said that General Collins' mission there is to make his own recommendations, and "he will take appropriate measures when necessary."

    美参院外委会讨论东南亚条约
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十二日讯：美国参议院外交委员会十一日开始公开讨论东南亚条约，这个条约是美国政府十日提交参议院批准的。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯首先作非正式的发言。他表示：美国准备不等这个条约生效就召开参加东南亚条约的国家的会议，来讨论同这个地区的“颠覆活动威胁”进行斗争的办法。
    杜勒斯说，美国应当在东南亚有“机动的攻击力量”。他还说，东南亚条约的经济方面的条款并没有责成美国要实现某种“大规模经济援助”的计划。
    杜勒斯要求参议院尽速批准这个条约。照他说来，这个条约是美国实现远东政策的一个“重大步骤”。
    从会议的过程中显然可以看出，参议院并不打算在目前的特别会议上批准东南亚公约，而是把这个公约搁到明年一月第八十四届国会开始举行会议时再说。
    杜勒斯在答复参议员的问题时说，在南越“造成了混乱的局势，因为南越没有一个有效能的政府”。他说，柯林斯将军到那里去的使命是提出自己的建议，“必要时他将采取适当的措施”。
