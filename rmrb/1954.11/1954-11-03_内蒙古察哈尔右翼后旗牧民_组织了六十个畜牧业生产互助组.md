Herdsmen in Chahar Right Banner Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia,
    Organized Sixty Livestock Production Mutual Aid Teams
    This year, four hundred and sixty-four Mongolian herdsmen in Chahar Right Banner Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, organized sixty livestock production mutual aid teams. The organized households account for 63.8 percent of the total number of herdsmen households in the banner, and more than one-third of them are year-round mutual aid teams.
    The Chahar Right Banner Rear Banner Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Banner People's Government attached importance to leading the herdsmen in consolidating and developing mutual aid teams, promoted the production enthusiasm of the herdsmen, and solved the problem of lack of manpower and materials. During the lambing season this year, many mutual aid teams implemented the method of taking turns following the herds during the day and taking turns lambing at night. Newborn lambs, pregnant ewes, and large sheep were separated into different pens, and thin pregnant ewes were given extra fodder, which increased the survival rate of young animals. The average survival rate of calves, foals, and lambs in the banner is between 90 and 95 percent. The herdsmen also organized wolf hunting teams to reduce livestock losses. Some herdsmen organized themselves to build dams to irrigate pastures and cultivate high-quality forage. Now, the herdsmen are carrying out winter livestock protection work, and the mutual aid teams are building sheds and preparing feed to ensure the safe wintering of livestock. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古察哈尔右翼后旗牧民
    组织了六十个畜牧业生产互助组
    内蒙古自治区察哈尔右翼后旗的四百六十四户蒙族牧民，今年组织了六十个畜牧业生产互助组，组织起来的牧户已占全旗牧户总数的百分之六十三点八，其中有三分之一多是常年互助组。
    中共察哈尔右翼后旗旗委会和旗人民政府重视领导牧民整顿和发展互助组，发扬了牧民的生产积极性，解决了人力物力缺乏的问题。今年接羔期间，许多互助组实行了白天轮流跟群、夜间轮流接羔的方法，并且将新生的羊羔、怀胎母羊和大羊分别圈开，对瘦弱的怀胎母羊贴喂草料，使幼畜成活率提高。全旗的牛犊、马驹和羊羔的平均成活率都在百分之九十到九十五。牧民们还组织了打狼小组，减少了牲畜损失，一部分牧民组织起来修水坝，用水浇灌牧场，培植优良牧草。现在，牧民们正在进行过冬保畜工作，各互助组在修棚搭圈，准备饲料，保证牲畜安全过冬。　（新华社）
