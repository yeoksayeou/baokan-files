Heilongjiang Province Deploys This Year's Grain Purchase Work
Requires All Regions to Strive to Implement the Policy of Purchasing as Much Surplus Grain as Possible

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial grain work conference from November 4th to 13th to deploy this year's grain purchase tasks. At the meeting, Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Yang Yichen, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, delivered reports respectively. The meeting criticized the partial views and fear of difficulties held by some cadres regarding grain purchase work. The cadres present generally established an overall perspective and strengthened their confidence in overcoming difficulties. On this basis, the meeting studied the grain output of various counties and determined the grain purchase tasks.

The meeting believes that completing this year's grain purchase task is entirely possible. First, the province has basically had a bumper harvest this year, and the total income from crops is no less than last year. Second, the Party's socialist advantage in the countryside has been established, and the socialist consciousness of the peasants has greatly improved. Third, the Party's team for socialist transformation and socialist construction in the countryside has grown stronger and stronger through years of training in various tasks, providing an organizational guarantee for the completion of the task.

Regarding grain purchase methods, the meeting believes that it is necessary to hold meetings of cadres at the county, district, and village levels, to open up cadres' minds, improve understanding, rely on grassroots organizations, conduct in-depth education and mobilization of the masses, accurately assess grain output, and ensure that the assigned tasks are in line with the surplus grain situation, overcoming the purely task-oriented viewpoint and strictly preventing the phenomenon of rigid apportionment. All regions should, based on their actual conditions, strive to implement the policy of purchasing as much surplus grain as possible, and strengthen the close integration of various rural economic tasks. Each county should establish a grain purchase work office to specifically lead this work.

The meeting also discussed and deployed the arrangements for this winter and next spring's work, and how grain purchase work should be combined with other rural economic work.

    黑龙江省部署今年购粮工作
    要求各地努力贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针
    【本报讯】中国共产党黑龙江省委员会在十一月四日到十三日召开了全省粮食工作会议，部署今年购粮任务。会上，中共黑龙江省委书记欧阳钦和省人民政府副主席杨易辰等分别作了报告。会议批判了一部分干部对待购粮工作的局部观点和惧怕困难的心理。到会干部普遍树立了整体观念，增强了克服困难的信心。在这种基础上，会议研究了各县的粮食产量，并确定了购粮任务。
    会议认为，完成今年购粮任务是完全可能的。第一，全省今年基本丰收，农作物总收入不低于去年。第二，党在农村的社会主义优势已经树立起来，农民的社会主义觉悟有了很大的提高。第三，党在农村进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的队伍，经过几年来在各种工作中的锻炼，日益壮大和坚强，给完成任务提供了组织保证。
    在购粮方法上，会议认为，必须开好县、区、村三级干部会议，打通干部思想，提高认识，依靠基层组织，深入教育和发动群众，摸准粮食产量，使布置的任务符合余粮的情况，克服单纯任务观点，严防硬性摊派的现象。各地应根据实际情况，努力贯彻尽量多购余粮的方针，并加强各项农村经济工作的紧密结合。各县要成立征购粮工作办公室，具体领导这一工作。
    会议对今冬明春工作的安排，购粮工作如何结合其他农村经济工作，也作了讨论和部署。
