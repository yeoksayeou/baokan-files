    Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the Liberation of Albania
    Today marks the tenth anniversary of the Albanian people's liberation from fascist enslavement and the rule of domestic reactionary forces. The Chinese people and peace-loving countries and people all over the world are enthusiastically celebrating this glorious day for the Albanian people.
    The Albanian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. In the history of Albania over the past few centuries, there have been epic and heroic deeds of the people resisting foreign bullying and imperialist oppression. Neither the long enslavement of the Turkish Empire, the contention of European powers, nor the barbaric occupation of Italian fascism could stop the Albanian people from fighting for national independence and freedom. During the years of World War II, the Albanian people ignited the flames of national liberation struggle everywhere in the country, demonstrating a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, and winning the sympathy and admiration of progressive mankind all over the world. Under the favorable situation created by the Soviet army's defeat of the German invaders and its advance into the Balkan Peninsula, the Albanian people finally drove out the fascist invading forces and completely liberated their own country.
    The liberation of Albania has opened up a broad path for the Albanian people to build a happy and prosperous life. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people have made tremendous achievements in consolidating the people's democratic system and building socialism.
    On January 11, 1946, Albania declared itself a People's Republic, establishing a people's democratic system based on the alliance of the working class and the working peasants. Then, it passed the first truly democratic constitution in history, consolidating the victorious achievements of the Albanian people in the revolutionary struggle through legislative procedures. After implementing democratic social and economic reforms and completing the restoration of the national economy, the people's regime led the Albanian people to rapidly enter planned economic construction. From 1951, the Albanian people began their first five-year plan aimed at establishing a socialist economic base. In the process of implementing the five-year plan, the Albanian people have made great progress in developing industry and transforming the entire national economy. By the end of 1954, Albania's total industrial output will have increased to 11.4 times that of pre-war levels, approaching the level originally planned to be reached in 1955, and the sown area of agriculture has increased by nearly 70 percent compared to pre-war levels. The output of technical crops needed for the development of light industry has greatly increased. The development of the national economy has brought tremendous changes to the lives of the Albanian people. Today, the Albanian people are living a well-fed, well-clothed, and cultured life.
    These great achievements of the Albanian people have been achieved in the context of forging an unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. In the years since liberation, Albania has established fraternal friendly relations with the countries of the peaceful democratic camp. This relationship fully demonstrates the characteristics of a new type of international relations that has never existed in history, and it is based on the equality of large and small countries, mutual respect for sovereignty, mutual assistance, and sincere cooperation. The existence of the powerful peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's aid to Albania are a guarantee for Albania's smooth socialist construction and an important source of all the victories of the Albanian people. Due to the Soviet Union's selfless material and technical assistance in Albania's economic and cultural construction, and due to the help and support of the entire peaceful democratic camp, the Albanian people have been able to concentrate their efforts on developing those industrial sectors that have favorable conditions in the country. This has enabled Albania's industrial construction to save a large amount of funds, concentrate on the main aspects, and make rapid progress.
    The liberation of Albania, the great achievements of Albania in building socialism, and its deep friendship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are extremely hated by imperialism. Over the years, imperialist aggressors have never stopped threatening and intimidating the Albanian people, and have used all possible means to sabotage Albania, attempting to interrupt Albania's peaceful construction, and even vainly attempting to overthrow the people's regime and turn Albania back into a colony of imperialism. However, the Albanian people have resolutely crushed all the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad. The Albanian people, who have undergone severe trials in the war and won independence and freedom through their own bloody struggle, vigilantly defend the independence and security of their motherland and unswervingly advance towards the goal of socialism. The Albanian people, who have already mastered their own destiny, are not to be underestimated and invincible.
    For ten years, the Albanian people have spared no effort to work with the countries of the peaceful democratic camp to strive for world peace and promote international cooperation. The government and people of the People's Republic of Albania resolutely oppose the policy of the Western imperialist countries headed by the United States to revive German militarism, and wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European collective security system. In its recent reply to the Soviet government, the government of the People's Republic of Albania declared its readiness to participate in the pan-European conference proposed by the Soviet government and will do its utmost to contribute to the success of the conference. In addition, the People's Republic of Albania has repeatedly reiterated its willingness to establish normal relations with its neighbors in the Balkan Peninsula. This effort by the People's Republic of Albania is clearly conducive to easing international tensions and consolidating European peace.
    The Chinese people have always expressed admiration and concern for the brave and hardworking Albanian people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the people of China and Albania has been growing day by day under the common goal of building socialism and defending world peace. In order to further develop friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields, the governments of China and Albania have recently sent ambassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary to each other. In October of this year, the government delegation of the People's Republic of Albania, headed by Foreign Minister B. Shtulla, signed agreements with our government in Beijing on cultural cooperation, technical, and technical scientific cooperation. There is no doubt that in the future, in the struggle for world peace and the happiness of the people, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples in all fields will continue to be strengthened and consolidated.
    On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Albania, I would like to wish our fraternal Albanian people new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace.

    庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚人民从法西斯奴役和本国反动势力统治下解放出来的十周年纪念日。中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，都以兴奋的心情来祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民这个光辉的日子。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民具有光荣的革命传统。在阿尔巴尼亚近几百年来的历史上，充满了人民反抗外族欺凌和帝国主义压迫的史诗般的英勇事迹。无论是土耳其帝国的长期奴役、欧洲列强的争夺或意大利法西斯的野蛮侵占，都没有能够使阿尔巴尼亚人民停止争取民族独立和自由的斗争。在第二次世界大战的年月里，阿尔巴尼亚人民在全国到处燃起了民族解放斗争的火焰，表现出了英勇顽强的战斗精神，获得了全世界进步人类的同情和钦佩。在苏联军队击败德国侵略者进军巴尔干半岛所造成的有利形势下，阿尔巴尼亚人民终于赶走了法西斯侵略军队，完全解放了自己的国土。
    阿尔巴尼亚的解放，为阿尔巴尼亚人民建设幸福美好的生活开辟了广阔的道路。十年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导之下，在巩固人民民主制度和建设社会主义的斗争中已经取得了巨大的成就。
    一九四六年一月十一日，阿尔巴尼亚宣布为人民共和国，确立了以工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟为基础的人民民主制度。接着又通过了历史上第一部真正民主的宪法，以立法的程序巩固了阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命斗争中所取得的胜利成果。人民政权在实行了社会经济的民主改革和完成了国民经济的恢复工作以后，就领导阿尔巴尼亚人民迅速地进入有计划的经济建设。从一九五一年起，阿尔巴尼亚人民开始了以建立社会主义经济基础为目的的第一个五年计划。在执行五年计划的过程中，阿尔巴尼亚人民已在发展工业和改造整个国民经济方面取得了很大的进展。到一九五四年底，阿尔巴尼亚的工业总产量将增加到战前的十一点四倍，接近于五年计划原定在一九五五年达到的水平，农业的播种面积比战前增加了近百分之七十。为发展轻工业所需的技术作物的产量是大大地增加了。国民经济的发展给阿尔巴尼亚人民的生活带来了巨大的变化。今天的阿尔巴尼亚人民正在过着丰衣足食的有文化的生活。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些巨大成就，是在和苏联与人民民主国家结成牢不可破的友谊的情况下获得的。在解放以后的年代里，阿尔巴尼亚与和平民主阵营各国建立起了兄弟般的友好关系。这种关系充分表现出了历史上从未有过的新型国际关系的特点，它是建立在大小国家平等、互相尊重主权、互相帮助与真诚合作的基础之上的。以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营的存在和苏联对阿尔巴尼亚的援助，是阿尔巴尼亚顺利建设社会主义的保证，是阿尔巴尼亚人民取得一切胜利的重要源泉。由于苏联对阿尔巴尼亚的经济与文化建设提供物质上和技术上的无私援助，由于得到整个和平民主阵营的帮助和支持，阿尔巴尼亚人民就能够集中精力去发展那些在本国具有有利条件的工业部门。这就使阿尔巴尼亚的工业建设得以节省大量的资金，而致力于主要方面，并得到迅速的进展。
    阿尔巴尼亚的解放，阿尔巴尼亚在建设社会主义中的巨大成就和它同苏联与人民民主国家的深厚友谊，是帝国主义所极端仇视的。这些年来，帝国主义侵略者从未停止过对阿尔巴尼亚人民进行威胁恫吓，并用一切可能的手段来对阿尔巴尼亚进行破坏活动，企图打断阿尔巴尼亚的和平建设，甚至妄想推翻人民政权，把阿尔巴尼亚重新变为帝国主义的殖民地。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决地粉碎了国内外敌人的一切阴谋。在战争中经过严重考验、以自己的流血斗争取得了独立自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民，警惕地保卫着祖国的独立和安全，坚定不移地向社会主义的目标前进。已经掌握了自己命运的阿尔巴尼亚人民是不可轻侮和不可战胜的。
    十年以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民不遗余力地与和平民主阵营各国一道，为争取世界和平与增进国际合作而斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和人民坚决反对以美国为首的西方帝国主义国家复活德国军国主义的政策，竭力拥护苏联政府关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张。在最近致苏联政府的复照中，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府宣布自己准备参加由苏联政府建议召开的全欧会议，并将尽其所能为会议的成功作出贡献。此外，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国还一再地重申愿意和巴尔干半岛各邻国建立正常的关系。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的这种努力，显然是有助于国际紧张局势的缓和与欧洲和平的巩固的。
    中国人民对于勇敢勤劳的阿尔巴尼亚人民一向表示钦佩和关怀。中华人民共和国成立以后，中阿两国人民的友谊在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的共同目标之下日见增进。为了进一步发展两国在政治、经济和文化方面的友好合作关系，中阿两国政府在最近互相派遣了特命全权大使。今年十月，以贝·什图拉外交部长为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府代表团在北京和我国政府签订了文化合作、技术和技术科学合作的协定。毫无疑问，今后在争取世界和平与人民幸福的斗争中，我们两国人民在各方面的友好合作关系必将不断加强与巩固。
    在欢庆阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年的时候，谨祝我们兄弟般的阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中获得日新月异的成就。
