    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th. Anhui Province plans to establish 30,000 new agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring. The first batch of 8,534 cooperatives have now been basically completed. At the same time, the original agricultural production cooperatives in various places have also been expanded.
    Since late September, more than 29,500 trained county, district, and township cadres and cooperative-building backbone personnel have been carrying out cooperative establishment work in rural areas throughout the province. The advantages shown by the old cooperatives in various places in exceeding production targets and in flood prevention, drainage, land reclamation, and replanting movements have attracted farmers. Farmers in various places are requesting to join and establish cooperatives in large numbers. Farmers in disaster areas, seeing that more than 2,000 agricultural production cooperatives in their areas have worked hard to drain water and replant, and that most of their harvests are still about the same as last year, have stated: "The more we are affected by disasters, the more we must take the socialist road." Farmers in non-disaster areas, seeing that agricultural production cooperatives have increased production by 20 to 30 percent compared to last year, have an even stronger desire to join and establish cooperatives.
    At present, various places are consolidating the newly established cooperatives through current production work. Various places are also summarizing the experiences of the first batch of cooperative establishment and are deploying and carrying out the second batch of cooperative establishment work.
   Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th. Gansu Province has tentatively planned to establish 6,000 new agricultural production cooperatives in batches this winter and next spring. After the plan is realized, the province will have more than 6,500 agricultural production cooperatives, with the number of member households reaching more than 6 percent of the total number of farm households in the province.
    In order to realize this plan, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to Party committees at all levels in agricultural areas twice in September and October, requiring Party committees at all levels to immediately take measures to shift the focus of leadership to the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and to seize the time to train cooperative-building backbone personnel and cooperative-building cadres in batches. While issuing instructions in September, it also dispatched 257 cadres to form working groups to go to ten regions, including Qingyang, Pingliang, Dingxi, Tianshui, Wudu, Jiuquan, Wuwei, Linxia, Xihai Gu, and Gaolan, to help carry out agricultural production movements centered on mutual aid and cooperation. At present, the Chinese Communist Party committees and county committees in various parts of Gansu Province have convened rural work conferences to examine their past leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Secretaries of Party committees at all levels have personally taken the lead in carrying out the work of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    At present, the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives has been completed in many areas of Gansu Province, and the work of establishing cooperatives has already begun in some areas. According to statistics, since the autumn harvest, about 41,600 farm households have registered to join agricultural production cooperatives, more than twice the number of farm households in the original agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest.

    安徽省今年新建八千多个农业合作社
    甘肃省各级党委积极领导建社工作
    【新华社合肥九日电】安徽省今冬明春计划新办农业生产合作社三万个。现在第一批八千五百三十四个社已基本建成。同时，各地原有的农业生产合作社也有扩大。
    九月下旬以来，全省二万九千五百多个经过训练的县、区、乡干部和办社骨干分子，就在全省农村中进行建社、办社工作。各地老社在超额增产和防汛、排涝、开荒、补种运动中所表现出来的长处，吸引了农民，各地农民成批地要求入社、办社。水灾区农民看到当地二千多个农业生产合作社今年努力排涝补种、开荒生产，大部分的收成仍然和去年差不多，他们提出“越受灾，就越是要走社会主义道路。”非灾区农民看到农业生产合作社绝大部分比去年增产了二、三成，要求入社、办社的情绪更加高涨。
    目前各地对已建成的新社正在通过当前的生产作巩固工作。各地并在总结第一批建社经验，布置与开展第二批建社工作。
   【新华社兰州九日电】甘肃省初步计划在今冬明春分批建立六千个新的农业生产合作社。这个计划实现后，全省农业生产合作社将达到六千五百多个，社员户数可达到全省农户总数的百分之六以上。
    为了实现这个计划，中共甘肃省委员会曾在九、十月间两次向农业地区各级党委发出指示，要求各级党委立即采取措施，将领导重心转移到互助合作运动方面来，抓紧时间分批训练建社骨干分子和建社干部。在九月份发出指示的同时，并抽调二百五十七名干部组成工作团，分赴庆阳、平凉、定西、天水、武都、酒泉、武威、临夏、西海固、皋兰等十个地区，帮助开展以互助合作为中心的农业生产运动。现在全省各地中共地委、县委会都已召开了农村工作会议，检查了过去对互助合作运动的领导。各级党委书记已亲自动手领导开展互助合作运动的工作。
    目前甘肃省很多地区的建社准备工作已经作好，部分地区建社工作已经开始。据统计，从秋收后到现在报名参加农业生产合作社的农户约有四万一千六百多户，超过秋收前原有农业生产合作社农户的两倍以上。
