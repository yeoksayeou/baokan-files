Zizhong County Slaughterhouse Uses Pork Bones to Render Oil

The workers of the Zizhong County State-owned Slaughterhouse in Sichuan Province successfully experimented with rendering oil from pork bones during the increase production and practice economy campaign. This experience has been promoted in slaughterhouses throughout the county. Statistics for September show that more than 5,500 jin of oil were rendered from pork bones. According to actual operations, every 100 jin of pork bones yields an average of about 11 jin of oil. The quality of the rendered bone oil is similar to that of ordinary lard and is edible. Moreover, the cost is low, about one-third cheaper per jin than the local market price of lard.

After implementing the rendering of oil from pork bones, the previously discarded pork bones can be utilized in large quantities. The pork bones after rendering can also be made into bone meal needed for agricultural production, reducing a degreasing procedure during bone meal processing and reducing the cost of bone meal.

    资中县屠宰场用猪骨熬油
    四川省资中县公营屠宰场工人在增产节约中，试用猪骨熬油成功。这一经验已在全县屠宰场推广，九月份统计用猪骨熬油五千五百多斤。根据实际操作证明，每一百市斤猪骨，平均出油约十一斤多，熬出的骨油质量和一般猪油相似，可供食用。而且成本低廉，每斤可比猪油的当地市场出售价格便宜三分之一左右。
    实行猪骨熬油以后，过去一向废弃的猪骨可被大量利用，熬过油的猪骨，还可制成农业生产需用的骨粉，为骨粉加工时减少一道脱脂手续，使骨粉成本降低。  （新华社）
