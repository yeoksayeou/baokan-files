Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 11th: Shandong Province has comprehensively launched the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. By the end of October, the province's grain purchases were 241.9 percent of the same period last year. Jining Prefecture, with faster progress, has completed 57 percent of its autumn grain unified purchase plan; Jiaozhou, Tai'an, Linyi, and other prefectures have also completed more than 30 percent of their unified purchase plans. The provincial cotton unified purchase plan for October was nearly completed by the end of October, with 100,000 dan more ginned cotton purchased than in the same period last year. Linyi Prefecture, where peanuts are harvested earlier, has purchased a large amount of peanut kernels, peanut fruit, and peanut oil.

Shandong Province has seen bumper harvests of several major crops this year. According to preliminary statistics, the total output of autumn grain increased by 3,243.3 million jin compared with last year; cotton increased by more than 80 million jin (ginned cotton) compared with last year; and peanuts increased by 760 million jin compared with last year. With some areas in Shandong Province suffering from natural disasters this year, Shandong Province's position in the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops is particularly important. As early as the beginning of September, the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Financial and Economic Committee comprehensively deployed the unified purchase of these three materials. People's governments at all levels successively convened enlarged cadre meetings, mobilizing enormous forces to invest in this work. Before the comprehensive launch of the unified purchase work, 127 counties selected more than 320 townships of different types to conduct pilot projects for unified purchase. Grain departments, state-owned commercial departments, and cooperatives in various regions have made various preparations for unified purchase. Grain storage warehouses and packaging materials needed for storing and transporting cotton and oil have been prepared. Currently, the unified purchase work has begun in the vast rural areas, and cadres are publicizing the great significance of unified purchase to the peasants. Working teams organized by provincial-level organs have gone to various places to help carry out the unified purchase.

    山东全面开始统购粮食棉花油料
    【新华社济南十一日电】山东省粮食、棉花、油料的统购工作已经全面开始。到十月底止，全省收购的粮食为去年同期的百分之二百四十一点九。进度较快的济宁专区已完成秋粮统购计划的百分之五十七；胶州、泰安、临沂等专区也完成统购计划的百分之三十以上。十月份全省的棉花统购计划到十月底已接近完成，比去年同期多收购皮棉十万担。花生收获季节较早的临沂专区，已收购大量花生仁、花生果和花生油。
    山东省今年几种主要农作物都喜庆丰收。据初步统计，秋粮总产量比去年增加三十二亿四千三百万斤；棉花比去年增加八千多万斤（皮棉）；花生比去年增加七亿六千万斤。在今年有些地区农作物受到自然灾害的情况下，山东省在粮食、棉花、油料统购中的地位显得分外重要。早在九月上旬，山东省人民政府财政经济委员会，就全面部署了三种物资的统购工作。各级人民政府相继召开了扩大干部会议，动员巨大力量，投入这一工作。统购工作全面开始前，一百二十七个县选择了三百二十多个不同类型的乡，进行了统购的试点工作。各地粮食部门和国营商业部门以及合作社，进行了统购的各项准备。储粮仓库和储运棉花、油料所需要的封裹器材等都已准备好了。目前，统购工作已在广大农村开始，干部正向农民宣传统购的重大意义。省级机关组织的工作队已分别到各地帮助进行统购。
