Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: In October, on the eve of the nationwide unified grain purchase, farmers sold a large amount of grain to the state. According to preliminary statistics from the national grain department, the purchase of rice increased by 780 million jin compared with the same period last year, the purchase of soybeans increased by about 190% compared with September, and the purchase of miscellaneous grains increased by more than 40% compared with September. Although the national wheat unified purchase plan has been overfulfilled, farmers in wheat-producing areas continued to sell in October. In Shandong Province, where the unified grain purchase work started earlier, the amount of grain purchased by the end of October was 241.9% of the same period last year. In Jiangjin Special District, Sichuan Province, the largest daily purchase during last year's unified grain purchase did not exceed three million jin, but this year it reached nine million jin in one day. In Hubei Province, the unified purchase work in 40% of the non-disaster areas is nearing completion.

This newspaper reports: State-owned commercial departments in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and other cities are rapidly transferring industrial products to the countryside to supply rural needs.

In October, state-owned commerce in Beijing transported more than 2,900 tons of goods from Qianmen Railway Station alone. Many of these goods were processed and purchased according to the needs of rural areas. Recently, the Beijing branch of the China Department Store Corporation specially processed more than 40,000 dozen towels, woolen sweaters, thick socks, etc., for rural areas in Northeast China and Shanxi Province. In October, the Beijing branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation executed the November cotton cloth transfer plan ahead of schedule and transferred an additional batch of high-quality khaki cloth to rural areas. The Beijing branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company increased the number of prepared medicines shipped to rural areas in the fourth quarter from 27 to 33.

In Shanghai, eight state-owned commercial purchasing and supply units, including department stores, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and monopoly products, transferred and supplied various daily-use department stores, fabrics, prepared medicines, dyes, and hardware of all sizes to all parts of the country in October, with a total value increasing by 13.08% compared with the same period last year. In October, several units improved their sales methods and organized visiting sales teams, carrying samples, brochures, and promotional materials such as slides, and went deep into all parts of the country to conduct extensive sales visits using methods such as commodity touring exhibitions, holding forums for salespeople and consumers, and conducting typical rural surveys. Through sales visits, they further clarified the needs of the current peak season market, assisted grassroots stores in various places to replenish their supply of goods, and expanded the sales of industrial products. For example, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Chemical Raw Materials Company expanded the sales of direct dyes through visiting sales, meeting the needs of rural areas for dyeing clothing materials after the planned supply of cotton cloth. To suit the requirements of farmers, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Corporation not only changed most of the original undershirts to fully open-front undershirts, but also designed and produced a new type of open-front, large-sleeved undershirt that is convenient for farmers to work in the fields. These products are very popular among farmers. Sewing machines, which were originally only suitable for urban needs, have been changed to small, exquisite, and easy-to-carry portable types, and are also very popular among herdsmen in Inner Mongolia and Northwest China. In order to actively transport industrial products to the countryside, various purchasing and supply units are actively improving business management, simplifying procedures, and striving for quick loading and quick transportation.

State-owned specialized companies in the Shenyang area are actively organizing industrial products to go to the countryside. On November 4th and 5th, the Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station invited staff from suburban supply and marketing cooperatives to visit commodity samples and signed supply contracts. In addition, it organized four visiting groups to conduct visits in the suburbs and exhibit commodities. The Shenyang branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation held a supply meeting and newly purchased more than a dozen new floral fabrics to supply rural needs. Various specialized companies have prepared a lot of materials for farmers this year, including fox fur hats, rabbit fur hats, various kinds of woolen sweaters and trousers, paper and stationery for farmers to use in winter schools, rubber-tired carts and tires, etc. This year, many products have been improved in quality and specifications according to farmers' opinions.

    国家十月份收购大量粮食
    北京等地迅速调运工业品供应农村需要
   【新华社十二日讯】十月份是全国粮食统购普遍开始的前夕，这个月农民向国家出售了大量粮食。据国家粮食部门初步统计，大米比去年同期多收购七亿八十万斤，大豆的收购量比九月份增加百分之一百九十左右，杂粮比九月份增加百分之四十以上。全国小麦统购计划虽已超额完成，但小麦产区的农民十月份还在继续出售。粮食统购工作开始较早的山东省，到十月底收购的粮食为去年同期的百分之二百四十一点九。四川省江津专区去年粮食统购中，收购最多的一天没有超过三百万斤，今年一天内曾收购九百万斤，湖北省有百分之四十的非灾区统购工作已接近结束。
    【本报讯】北京、上海、沈阳等市国营商业部门，迅速调运工业品下乡供应农村需要。
    北京市国营商业十月份仅由前门车站运出的商品就有二千九百多吨。其中许多商品都是根据农村的需要加工和采购的。中国百货公司北京市公司最近专为东北和山西等地农村加工四万多打毛巾和绒衣、厚线袜子等。中国花纱布公司北京市公司在十月份就提前执行十一月份棉布调运计划，并增调了一批质量高的卡叽布到各地农村去。中国医药公司北京市公司第四季度运往农村的成药由以前的二十七种增加到三十三种。
    上海市百货、医药、化工、专卖等八个国营商业采购供应单位，十月份调拨供应全国各地的各种日用百货、布匹、成药、染料和大小五金，总值比去年同期增加了百分之一三点零八。十月份中，好几个单位都改进了推销方法，曾先后组织访问推销队，携带商品的样品、样本以及说明书、幻灯等宣传材料，深入全国各地，用商品巡回展览、举办销售员和消费者座谈会以及对农村典型调查等方法进行广泛的推销访问。通过推销访问，进一步摸清了当前旺季市场的需要，协助各地基层商店充实货源，扩大了工业品的推销。如中国化工原料公司上海采购供应站通过访问推销，扩大推销了直接染料，满足了棉布计划供应后农村翻染衣料的需要。中国百货公司上海采购供应站为适合农民的要求，不仅把原来的卫生衣大部分改为全开襟的卫生衣，而且还新设计生产了一种开襟大袖便于农民下地工作的卫生衣。这些产品很受农民欢迎。原来仅适合城市需要的缝纫机，改为小巧玲珑、携带方便的手提式之后，也很受内蒙古和西北地区牧民的欢迎。为了积极输送工业品下乡，各采购供应单位积极改善经营管理、简化手续，争取快装快运。
    沈阳地区各国营专业公司积极组织工业品下乡。沈阳百货批发站在十一月四、五两日，邀请市郊供销合作社工作人员参观了商品样品，签订了供应合同；另外还组织了四个访问组，准备深入郊区进行访问，并展览商品。中国花纱布公司沈阳市公司召开了供应会议，新采购了十多种新花布供应农村的需要。各专业公司今年为农民们准备的物资很多，有狐狸皮帽子、兔皮帽子，有各式各样的绒衣、绒裤，有供农民上冬学用的纸张文具，有胶轮大车和轮胎等等，今年有许多产品已根据农民们的意见，改进了质量和规格。
