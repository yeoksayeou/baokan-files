    Northeast Petroleum Third Factory Completes Annual National Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The Northeast Petroleum Third Factory comprehensively overfulfilled the 1954 national plan by the end of October. According to statistics up to the end of October: the total value of production exceeded the total value of the annual national plan by 7.2 percent, labor productivity exceeded the national target by 4 percent, product quality all reached the national standard, the actual cost was 17.4 percent lower than the national target, and the profits turned over to the state exceeded the annual plan by 559 percent.
    Before April of this year, the safety production situation of the Petroleum Third Factory was not very good. The factory leadership learned the lessons from failing to complete the national plan last year and adopted various effective measures. First, they focused on plan management and the implementation of work plans. When issuing work plan targets at the beginning of each month, they proposed key issues for completing tasks and measures to ensure safety, and mobilized workers to carry out technical innovations.
    This year, more than 250 rationalization proposals were adopted and implemented in the entire factory. Among them, the improvement of crude oil equipment increased the processing volume by more than 40 percent; after the cooler was modified, the oil recovery rate increased by 1.5 percent. During this year's overhaul, they promoted decisive advanced experience. For example, during the overhaul of the "Three Major Projects," they promoted the overhaul experience of the Liaoyuan Power Plant, which ensured safety, guaranteed quality, and completed the overhaul task ten days ahead of schedule. They also comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of the "Scientific and Safe Operation Method" from the third quarter, creating a new record of safe production with only one minor injury accident in August, September, and October. These works played a guaranteed role in completing the annual national plan ahead of schedule. (Zhang Ming)

    东北石油三厂提前完成全年国家计划
    东北石油三厂在十月底已经全面超额完成了一九五四年国家计划。截至十月底的统计：生产总值超过全年国家计划总值的百分之七点二，劳动生产率超过国家规定指标的百分之四，产品质量也全部达到国家规定标准，实际成本比国家指标降低了百分之十七点四，上缴国家的利润也超过全年计划的百分之五百五十九。
    在今年四月以前，石油三厂安全生产情况还不太好，厂部领导上接受了去年没有完成国家计划的教训，采取了各种有效措施。首先他们抓紧了计划管理和实现作业计划。在每月初下达作业计划指标时，他们都提出完成任务的关键问题和保证安全的措施计划，发动职工进行技术革新。
    今年在全厂采纳并实现的合理化建议达二百五十多件，其中改进粗溜设备一项提高了处理量百分之四十以上；冷却器改装以后，使收油率增加了百分之一点五。在今年检修过程中，他们推广了有决定性的先进经验。如“三大工程”检修时，推行了辽源发电厂的检修经验，保证了安全，保证了质量，提前十天完成了检修任务。他们还从第三季度开始全面推行了“科学安全运行法”的先进经验，创造了八、九、十月份只有一次微伤事故的安全生产新纪录。这些工作对提前完成全年国家计划起了保证作用。　（张鸣）
