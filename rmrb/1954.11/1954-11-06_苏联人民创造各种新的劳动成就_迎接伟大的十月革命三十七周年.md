Soviet People Create Various New Labor Achievements
    Greeting the 37th Anniversary of the Great October Revolution
    The Labor Enthusiasm of Large Hydropower Station Builders
    The 37th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is approaching, and the labor enthusiasm of the builders of major hydropower stations in the Soviet Union has been even higher these past few days.
    At the construction site of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the construction workers who won the mobile red flag of the Soviet Council of Ministers in the all-Soviet labor competition in the third quarter of this year are enthusiastically launching a competition to complete and overfulfill production tasks these days. As of November 3, dredging workers excavating canals and building dikes had exceeded this year's plan by excavating one million cubic meters of soil. In the competition, the builders of the artificial reservoir "Kuibyshev Sea" have created excellent results, having poured an additional 17,000 cubic meters of concrete beyond the plan in October.
    At the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, operators of dredgers and other earthmoving machines have already completed their annual work plan ahead of schedule. They have excavated more than 8 million cubic meters of soil from the foundation pits of spillway dams, sluices, and canals. The concrete pouring work of the power plant building has been overfulfilled. The stators of four turbines have been installed. Construction workers are now busily assembling a 1,500-meter-long, 40-meter-high metal trestle for transporting concrete.
    News of new labor achievements has also come from the construction sites of the Kakhovka Hydropower Station and the Kama Hydropower Station. Since the beginning of this year, more than 500,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete have been poured at the Kakhovka Hydropower Station construction site, and nearly 5 million cubic meters of soil have been moved. The workers of the Kama Hydropower Station have put the fourth turbine into operation ahead of schedule, and are now striving to test the fifth turbine before the October Revolution Day.

    New Achievements of New Textile Enterprise Builders
    The builders of new textile enterprises throughout the Soviet Union are greeting the great October Revolution Day with new labor achievements.
    The construction workers of the Bryansk United Woolen Mill have completed 180 percent of their annual work quota. They have already built the walls of the main factory buildings, warehouses, and some welfare buildings. The metal frame assembly of other projects is also nearing completion. Now, the construction workers are starting to decorate the weaving workshops. Automatic looms are being shipped in continuously from all over the country. After the Bryansk United Woolen Mill is put into production, it can produce 7 million meters of high-quality woolen fabric annually.
    The construction workers of a woolen factory in the southern suburbs of Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Republic, are engaged in a socialist competition to greet the October Revolution Day. The main factory buildings have been completed, and the final finishing work is now underway. They are preparing to install machines on a production site of about 15,000 square meters. After the factory is completed, it will produce 10 million meters of textiles annually.
    A large-scale cotton textile factory is being built in Kamyshin, near Stalingrad. Hundreds of machines have been installed in the workshops of the first textile factory of the cotton textile factory, and are now being test-run. This textile factory will have 120,000 spindles. The second textile factory is being built at an accelerated pace. After the Kamyshin Cotton Textile Factory is fully completed and put into operation, it can produce one million meters of textiles every day.
    The construction of a large cotton textile factory in Engels City is progressing rapidly. The factory buildings of the third textile factory of this factory are now being built. The assembly of the metal frame of the factory building is nearing completion, and the walls of the factory building have begun to be built. This cotton textile complex will have five factories. Some dormitories have already been built in the workers' residential area near the factory.

    Dozens of Rural Hydropower Stations Begin to Generate Electricity
    On the eve of the October Socialist Revolution Day, dozens of new rural hydropower stations have been completed one after another in the Soviet Union and have begun to generate electricity. Two power stations have recently been built on the Hando River and the Kriti River in the Georgian Republic, and will begin to supply electricity to several mountain villages on the eve of the October Revolution Day. A hydropower station has been built near the village of Yurchinni in Moldavia, and collective farmers' families will begin to use electric lights. The two newly built hydropower stations in the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation have a total generating capacity of 720 kilowatts, which will electrify ten collective farms. In addition, in Ukraine and the Karelo-Finnish Republic, in the Kuban, Stavropol Territory, Leningrad Oblast, and Orel Oblast, hundreds of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms are about to receive electricity supply.
    The Soviet Union has built more than 450 rural power stations this year. Many of these power stations have a generating capacity of 400 to 1,000 kilowatts. Due to the continuous commissioning of new power stations, the electricity generated by collective farm power stations and transformer substations in the Soviet Union is now seven times that before the Patriotic War, and tens of thousands of collective farms have been electrified.

    New Line of Underground Tramway Opens
    The "May First" Station of the Moscow Underground Tramway has been completed on the eve of the October Revolution Day, and the new line from "Izmailovo" Station to "May First" Station has been opened. On October 4, the opening ceremony of the new line was held at the "May First" Station. In the spacious and bright hall of the station, construction workers and representatives of Moscow people's organizations gathered. After the opening ceremony, the guests boarded the carriages of a special light blue express train. The tram slowly left the platform amidst the sound of music.
    The newly completed "May First" Station is the first above-ground station of the Moscow Underground Tramway. The station's ticket hall is beautifully decorated with bronze and marble. Eight tall columns support the elaborately crafted ceiling. The floor of the station platform is paved with patterned tiles, and the walls and cornices are decorated with statues and carvings. The station is equipped with all the comfortable facilities for passengers, and even in the harsh winter, the platform is warm. After the new line is opened, transportation from Izmailovo, a newly emerging residential area, to the center of Moscow will be more convenient. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联人民创造各种新的劳动成就
    迎接伟大的十月革命三十七周年
    大水电站建设者的劳动热情
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年即将到来，苏联各大水电站的建设者的劳动热情这几天来更加高涨。
    在古比雪夫水电站工地上，曾在今年第三季度全苏联劳动竞赛中荣获苏联部长会议流动红旗的建筑工人们，这些天来正热烈地展开争取完成和超额完成生产任务的竞赛。到十一月三日，挖掘运河和修筑堤坝的吸泥机工人，已超过今年的计划挖掘了一百万公方的泥土。在竞赛中，人造水库“古比雪夫海”的建设者们已创造了优异的成绩，他们在十月份超计划多浇灌了一万七千公方的混凝土。
    在斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工地上，吸泥机和其他挖土机器的操使者已经提前完成了一年的工作计划。他们从溢洪道大堤、水闸和运河的基坑中挖去了八百多万公方泥土。电力厂房的浇灌混凝土的工作已经超额完成。有四个涡轮机的固定子已经安装好了。建筑工人们现在正在紧张地装配一座长一千五百公尺、高四十公尺的装运混凝土的金属栈桥。
    卡霍夫卡水电站和卡马水电站工地上也传来了新的劳动成就的消息。从今年年初到现在，卡霍夫卡水电站工地上已经浇灌了五十多万公方钢筋混凝土，移去了将近五百万公方泥土。卡马水电站的工人们已提前使第四台水轮机开始发电，目前正在争取在十月革命节以前试用第五台水轮机。
    新纺织企业建筑者的新成就
    苏联全国各地的新纺织企业的建筑者们正以新的劳动成就来迎接伟大的十月革命节。
    布利安斯克联合制呢厂的建筑工人们已经完成了他们的全年工作定额百分之一百八十。他们已经建筑好了主要厂房的墙壁、仓库和一些福利建筑物。其他工程的金属构架装配工作也即将完工。现在，建筑工人们正开始为织呢车间进行修饰工作。自动织呢机正源源不断地从各地运来。布利安斯克联合制呢厂投入生产后，每年可生产七百万公尺上等呢料。
    白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克南郊的一个制呢工厂的建筑工人们，正在进行迎接十月革命节的社会主义竞赛。工厂的主要厂房已经建成，现在正在进行最后的修饰工作。他们正准备在约一万五千平方公尺的生产场地上安装机器。这个工厂建成后，每年将生产一千万公尺纺织品。
    斯大林格勒附近的卡米新正在建筑一个规模巨大的棉织厂。棉织厂的第一纺织工厂的车间中已经安装了几百部机器，现在正在试车。这个纺织工厂将有十二万个纱锭。第二个纺织工厂正在加速建筑中。卡米新棉织厂全部建成并开工生产后，每天可生产一百万公尺纺织品。
    恩格斯城的一个大型棉织厂的建筑工程正在迅速进行中。现在正在建筑这个工厂的第三纺织厂的厂房。厂房的金属构架的装配工作即将完成，厂房的墙壁已开始建筑。这个棉织联合企业将有五个工厂。工厂附近的工人居住区内已经建成了一些宿舍。
    几十个农村水电站开始发电
    在十月社会主义革命节前夕，苏联又有几十个新的农村水电站陆续建成，并开始发电。在格鲁吉亚共和国的汉多河和克里季河上最近已经建成了两个电力站，在十月革命节前夕将开始向几个山村供应电力。摩尔达维亚的尤尔钦尼村附近已有一个水电站建成，集体农民的家庭将开始有电灯使用。俄罗斯联邦克拉斯诺达边疆区新建的两个水电站，共有七百二十瓩的发电能力，它们将使十个集体农庄电气化。此外，在乌克兰和卡累利阿—芬兰共和国，在库班、斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区、列宁格勒州和奥勒尔州，有几百个集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场即将得到电力的供应。
    苏联今年已建成了四百五十多个农村电力站。其中有许多电力站的发电能力达四百到一千瓩。由于新的电力站的陆续投入生产，现在苏联集体农庄电力站和变压变电所发出的电力，已等于卫国战争前的七倍，几万个集体农庄已经电气化了。
    地下电车道新线路通车
    莫斯科地下电车道的“五一”车站已经在十月革命节前夕竣工，从“伊兹梅尔”车站到“五一”车站的新线路已经通车。十月四日，在“五一”车站上举行了新线路的通车典礼。在车站宽敞明亮的大厅里，聚集了建筑工人和莫斯科人民团体的代表。通车典礼结束后，来宾们登上浅蓝色的特别快车的车厢。电车便在音乐声中缓缓地离开了月台。
    新落成的“五一”车站是莫斯科地下电车道的第一个地上车站。车站的售票大厅用青铜和大理石装饰得十分美丽。有八个高大的柱子支撑着精工制成的天花板。车站月台的地面用花砖砌成，墙壁和墙檐上饰有塑像和雕刻。车站为旅客准备了一切舒适的设备，就是在严寒的冬季，月台上也是温暖的。新线路通车后，从伊兹梅尔这个新兴的住宅区到莫斯科市中心的交通更加方便了。  （据新华社讯）
