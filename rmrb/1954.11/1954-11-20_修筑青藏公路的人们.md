The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and people of all ethnic groups who are building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway have rapidly extended it from Qinghai to Heihe in Tibet.

In the process of building the highway, the construction personnel fought against grasslands, snow mountains, and turbulent currents on the plateau, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. When the highway reached the rapidly flowing Ulan Mulun River, it was necessary to erect a large bridge to cross it. However, in the deserted grasslands, not even an inch of wood could be found. The construction personnel created the method of "diverting water and laying paved water-crossing surfaces," overcoming the difficulty of lacking wood and conquering the river. In the icy, turbulent currents, the construction personnel carried heavy bags of stones, working in the water for more than nine hours every day. Their legs were often chapped from the cold, but they said that no matter how cold the snow water was, it could not freeze their determination to conquer nature, and they persisted in their work. During the construction of the Xue Shui River Bridge, the construction personnel worked in mid-air, climbing up the cliffs along the riverbanks, which were more than 40 meters high, and finally built the bridge. To commemorate this arduous project, they named the bridge the "Tianya Bridge" (Sky Cliff Bridge). Sheng Geng, a Mongolian worker who grew up on the Qinghai grasslands, transported stones back and forth on ice water and gravel to build his hometown. The gravel stuck to his bare feet, and a layer of skin was worn off the soles of his feet, but he still tirelessly fought the ice water and made great contributions.

When there was a shortage of tools, the construction personnel used tent pegs as tools. In the rainstorm, without raincoats, they wore their sheepskin coats inside out to work. When the pickaxes and shovels were worn out, they were re-hammered and used again. Without a charcoal stove to repair tools, the workers used cow dung fires instead. Fourteen construction personnel were left behind to recuperate due to physical weakness, but during their recuperation, they built eight cave dwellings on the hillside, providing comfortable accommodation for those who came later. The medical workers serving the construction personnel not only provided medical treatment but also assisted the construction personnel in building roads. During the construction, the cadres leading the road construction went deep into the construction sites and worked alongside the construction soldiers and workers. For example, Mu Shengzhong, the political commissar of the road construction corps, often braved wind and snow to travel back and forth on the dozens of kilometers of construction lines to help the construction personnel solve difficult problems.

Now, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been opened to traffic to Heihe. On this highway, people are praising the brave and strong road-building heroes.

    修筑青藏公路的人们
    倪潜　格来
    修筑青藏公路的中国人民解放军战士和各民族的民工们，已迅速地把青藏公路从青海修到西藏黑河。
    在修筑公路的过程中，筑路人员在拔海四千公尺以上的高原上，和草原、雪山、激流作斗争。当公路修到流水湍急的乌兰木伦河上的时候，需要架起很大的桥梁才能通过，但在千里无人烟的草原上，连一寸木料也找不到，筑路人员们就创造了“排水分流、填铺过水路面”的办法，克服了缺乏木料的困难，战胜了这条河流。在结着冰块的激流里，筑路人员背着沉重的石袋，每天在水里工作达九个小时以上。他们的腿上常被冻裂了口，但是他们说，雪水再冷，也冻不住我们战胜自然的决心，仍坚持工作。在架设雪水河桥梁的工程中，筑路人员们悬空作业，爬上了沿河两岸四十多公尺高的悬崖上进行工作，终于架好了这座大桥。为了纪念这一艰险的工程，他们就把这座大桥命名为“天崖桥”。生长在青海草原上的蒙族民工生更，为了建设自己的家乡，来往在冰水和碎石上搬运石块，碎石沾在他的光脚上，脚底磨掉了一层皮，但他仍然不懈地和冰水搏斗，立下了大功。
    在缺少工具的时候，筑路人员就用帐篷钉子当工具。在暴风雨中没有雨衣，他们就翻穿着皮袄做工。洋镐圆锹磨秃了，重新锤打以后再用。修理工具没有炭炉，工人们就用牛粪火来代替。有十四个筑路人员因身体弱留在后边休养，但是他们在休养中，在山坡上修了八眼窑洞，使以后来往的人们有了舒适的住处。为筑路人员服务的医务工作者，他们一面进行医疗，一面还协助筑路人员修路。在施工中，领导筑路的干部都深入工地，和筑路战士、工人们一同工作，如筑路总队政治委员慕生忠，经常冒着风雪来往在数十公里长的施工线上，帮助筑路人员解决困难问题。
    现在，青藏公路已通车到了黑河，在这条公路上，人们赞扬着勇敢坚强的筑路英雄们。
