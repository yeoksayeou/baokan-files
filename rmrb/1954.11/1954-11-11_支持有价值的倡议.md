Newspaper Review

	Supporting Valuable Initiatives
	To increase oil production, it is necessary not only to vigorously promote advanced experiences in the oil industry and improve oil extraction rates but also to expand the use of various oil-bearing raw materials and open up new oil sources. In some newspapers, such as Shanghai's "Liberation Daily," people have seen introductions on extracting oil from silkworm pupae and rice bran using the "leaching method." More recently, in the "Qingdao Daily," people have seen reports on extracting oil from leftover vegetable soup and vegetable scraps.

	The "Qingdao Daily" published a news item on October 31st titled "Oil Can Be Extracted from Leftover Vegetable Soup and Vegetable Scraps." The news item introduced a valuable suggestion from craftsman Xu Facheng. Xu Facheng had researched a method for extracting oil from leftover vegetable soup and vegetable scraps and wrote to the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee in July of this year to suggest an experiment. The Qingdao Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee adopted this suggestion and instructed the Qingdao Municipal Cooperative Union to be responsible for further research with Xu Facheng, and introduced six larger cooking units to Xu Facheng to collect vegetable soup and vegetable scraps for experimentation. In nearly two months, Xu Facheng collected more than 40,000 catties of vegetable soup and vegetable scraps, extracting more than 2,300 catties of oil, with an oil extraction rate of about 5%. The quality of the oil was also very good and could be used to make soap and for sizing yarn. Public and private factories in Qingdao were willing to purchase it. The extraction process and equipment are very simple, and the cost is not high. To increase oil production, the Qingdao Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee is now organizing family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and some impoverished citizens with labor capabilities in the city to use this method to extract oil.

	In cities, due to the concentration of population, there are many restaurants, as well as government agencies, organizations, and enterprises, and the amount of leftover food and fruit peels every day is considerable. These things are often discarded as waste. In the past, someone suggested using these leftovers and fruit peels to raise pigs to increase the city's meat supply, but unfortunately, no news of experiments has been seen. The Qingdao Municipal Financial and Economic Committee attached importance to and supported the people's initiative, and craftsman Xu Facheng indeed extracted oil from this "waste" that the country and the people urgently needed, indicating that these "wastes" are indeed very usable, and therefore this initiative is worthy of attention. It is very necessary for newspapers to support and promote his initiative.

### 支持有价值的倡议

    支持有价值的倡议
    为了增加油脂的生产，不仅需要大力推广油脂工业中的先进经验，提高出油率；而且需要扩大利用各种可以制油的原料，开辟新的油源。在有些报纸如上海解放日报上，人们曾经看到关于用“浸出法”从蚕蛹中和米糠中提炼油脂的介绍；在最近的青岛日报上，人们又看到关于剩余菜汤和菜渣炼油的报道。
    青岛日报在十月三十一日发表了一条“剩余菜汤和菜渣可以炼油”的消息。消息中介绍了手工业者徐法成的一个有价值的建议。徐法成曾研究出以剩余菜汤和菜渣提炼油脂的办法，并于今年七月间写信给青岛市人民政府财经委员会建议试验。青岛市人民政府财经委员会采纳了这个意见，责成青岛市合作社联合社负责和徐法成作进一步的研究，并介绍了六个较大的做菜单位让徐法成收集菜汤菜渣作试验。在将近两个月的时间内，徐法成共收集菜汤和菜渣四万多斤，炼出油脂二千三百多斤，出油率达百分之五左右，油的质量也很好，可以用来制肥皂和浆纱，青岛市公、私营工厂都愿意购用。而提炼的过程和设备却很简单，所花费用也不多。青岛市人民政府财经委员会为了增加油脂的生产，现正组织该市烈属军属及部分有劳动力的贫苦市民，采用这种办法来提炼油脂。
    城市中由于人口集中，饭馆以及机关、团体、企业单位很多，每天剩菜剩饭和瓜果皮的数量相当可观。这些东西往往被当作废物抛弃。过去曾经有人提议利用这些剩菜剩饭和瓜果皮来养猪，以增加城市的肉食来源，可惜还没有看到进行试验的消息。青岛市财经委员会重视和支持了人民的倡议，手工业者徐法成果然从这种“废物”中提炼出国家和人民迫切需要的油脂，说明这些“废物”确实大可利用，因而这一倡议是值得重视的。报纸对他的倡议加以支持和推广是很有必要的。　　（珩）
