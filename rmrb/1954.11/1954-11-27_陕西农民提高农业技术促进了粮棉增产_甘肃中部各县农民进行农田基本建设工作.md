    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. This year, Shaanxi Province's agricultural technology has been further improved, ensuring increased production of grain and cotton. Of the more than 24 million mu of wheat in the province's summer harvest, more than 8.76 million mu used improved varieties such as "Bima No. 1," "6028," and "Qitouhong," resulting in an increase of more than 262 million jin of wheat. The 600,000 mu of "Jingsi Cotton" and "517" improved cotton varieties in counties such as Hu and Chang'an yielded an average of 52 to 70 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 16 to 33 percent compared to last year. Local farmer varieties such as "Hongxin Mayazi" corn in Zhouzhi County, "Dajixiang" millet in Zhidan County, and "Chao Laohan" sorghum in Qishan County have also seen increased production.

    One of the important factors in the bumper harvest of more than 4 million mu of cotton fields in the province this year is the increased amount of fertilizer applied. Seventy percent of the more than 340,000 mu of cotton fields in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area were fertilized with base manure, an increase of 10 percent compared to last year. In some areas of counties such as Feng and Zhouzhi, the promotion of green manure in wheat fields has resulted in a 20 to 40 percent increase in wheat production. The agricultural technicians in the Hanzhong Special District passed on techniques such as cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting, applying fertilizer in stages, and preventing lodging, which resulted in a 6 percent increase in the total output of more than 1.3 million mu of rice compared to last year.

    In addition, in the three special districts of Yulin, Suide, and Yan'an, except for the sandy areas, farmers have plowed 70 to 80 percent of the land once in the spring, generally harrowing immediately after plowing, changing the local habit of planting on hard stubble. Farmers in mountainous areas actively build dams and weirs, construct terraced fields, and plant trees to strengthen soil and water conservation. These technical measures have also effectively promoted increased agricultural production.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. Farmers organized in central Gansu Province are carrying out basic farmland construction work to transform nature on more than 10 million mu of cultivated land, including building terraced fields, digging wells, and planting trees. The construction of many medium and small-sized canals and reservoirs that can irrigate dozens to thousands of mu of land, planned for this winter, has already begun. The plan for the seven counties of Gaolan, Huining, etc., to expand the irrigated area by more than 280,000 mu and build more than 160,000 mu of terraced fields this winter will soon be completed.

    The state has allocated more than 60 billion yuan in special funds to support the basic farmland construction work in the central Gansu Province. The Gansu Provincial People's Government has also successively dispatched survey teams, measuring teams, and a large number of technical cadres. Counties, districts, and townships have all formulated long-term and winter-spring construction plans based on local conditions, and have also trained more than 10,000 district and township cadres, agricultural production cooperative chairmen, and mutual aid group leaders to guide farmers in building water conservancy projects, conserving soil and water, and planting trees.

    陕西农民提高农业技术促进了粮棉增产
    甘肃中部各县农民进行农田基本建设工作
   【新华社西安讯】今年陕西省农业技术进一步提高，保证了粮食和棉花的增产。全省夏收的两千四百多万亩麦田中，采用“碧蚂一号”、“六零二八”和“齐头红”等良种的面积有八百七十六万多亩，增产的小麦达二亿六千二百多万斤。户县、长安等县六十万亩“泾斯棉”和“五一七”良种棉花，平均每亩产皮棉五十二斤到七十斤，比去年增产百分之十六到三十三。周至县的“红心马牙”玉米、志丹县的“大吉祥”谷子、岐山县的“晁老汉”高粱等当地农家良种，也都得到增产。
    今年全省四百多万亩棉田丰收的重要因素之一是施肥量增加。泾惠渠灌溉区三十四万多亩棉田有七成上了底粪，比去年增加一成。凤县、周至等县部分地区由于推行了麦田压绿肥的办法，使小麦增产百分之二十到四十。汉中专区的农业技术干部向农民传授的培育壮秧、合理密植、分期施肥、防止倒伏等技术，使一百三十多万亩水稻的总产量比去年高出百分之六。
    此外，榆林、绥德、延安等三个专区除风沙地区外，其余百分之七十到八十的土地，农民在春季都耕翻一次，一般随翻随耱，改变了当地硬茬种地的习惯。各地山区农民积极打坝堰，修梯田，植树造林，加强水土保持工作。这些技术措施，也有效地促进了农业增产。
    【新华社兰州讯】甘肃省中部各县组织起来的农民，正在一千多万亩的耕地上，进行修筑梯田、打井、植树等改造自然的农田基本建设工作。今冬计划修筑的可以灌溉数十亩到数千亩地的许多中、小型渠道和水库已经开工。皋兰、会宁等七县今冬扩大灌溉面积二十八万多亩，修梯田十六万多亩的计划很快就可完成。
    国家为支持甘肃省中部地区农田基本建设工作而拨出的专款达六百多亿元。甘肃省人民政府也先后派出了勘察队、测量队和大批技术干部。各县、区、乡都因地制宜地制订了长期的和今冬明春的建设计划，还训练了一万多个指导农民兴修水利、水土保持、植树造林的区、乡干部和农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长。
