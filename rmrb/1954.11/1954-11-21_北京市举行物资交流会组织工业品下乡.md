    Beijing held a rural and urban materials exchange fair starting on the 16th to organize industrial products for rural areas. In addition to representatives from Beijing's state-owned commercial enterprises, local industries, handicraft production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives, more than 200 representatives from state-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Rehe, Liaoning, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Guangxi, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also participated, many of whom came from grassroots stores and cooperatives.

    On the 17th, after visiting the exhibition hall with nearly 5,000 kinds of products, representatives from various regions began trading. In the one and a half days up to the 18th, transactions worth more than 16.2 billion yuan had already been completed. Representatives from bountiful harvest areas reflected that the purchasing power of farmers there has increased significantly this year. They not only need daily commodities such as wool sweaters, wool pants, bed sheets, rubber shoes, bamboo-shell thermos bottles, socks, and towels, but also handicrafts such as children's clothing, children's hats, and children's toys. Zhang Qingshou, a representative from Anyang Prefecture in Henan Province, which is rich in cotton and tobacco, said: "Last winter, Anyang Prefecture only sold more than 34,000 dozens of socks and more than 2,000 dozens of wool sweaters and pants. This year, the fourth quarter plans to sell nearly 50,000 dozens of socks and more than 6,700 dozens of wool sweaters and pants. In some areas, the demand already exceeds supply." He has already purchased more than 2.8 billion yuan worth of industrial products at the exchange fair and is actively contacting various units to prepare to purchase more than 4 billion yuan worth of industrial products. The conference also actively helped disaster areas to sell sideline products. The straw braid, cloth shoes, willow poles, and reed mats sold from the disaster areas of Tianjin and Cangxian Prefectures in Hebei Province alone were worth 3.1 billion yuan.

    To meet the needs of various regions for industrial products, purchasing and supply stations of China National Department Store in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places have also sent representatives to participate in the conference transaction.

    The Beijing Railway, Insurance, and Banking departments have all set up service teams at the meeting. The railway department has also promised to transport the products traded rapidly. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市举行物资交流会组织工业品下乡
    十六日起，北京市举行城乡物资交流会，组织工业品下乡。参加交流会的除北京市国营商业、地方工业、手工业生产合作社、供销合作社等系统的代表外，还有河北、山西、山东、河南、湖南、热河、辽宁、甘肃、黑龙江、四川、广西和内蒙古自治区等地区的国营商业和合作社代表二百多人，其中不少代表来自基层商店和合作社。
    十七日，各地代表参观了近五千种产品的陈列室后，就开始交易，到十八日的一天半时间内，已成交一百六十二亿多元。来自丰收地区的代表们反映，那里农民的购买力今年有显著提高，他们不但很需要绒衣、绒裤、床单、胶鞋、竹壳暖瓶、袜子、毛巾等日用商品，还需要童装、童帽、儿童玩具等手工业产品。河南省盛产棉花和烟叶的安阳专区的代表张清寿说：去年冬季安阳专区只销了三万四千多打袜子，二千多打绒衣、绒裤；今年第四季度计划销售的袜子近五万打，绒衣、绒裤六千七百多打，现在有些地区已发生供不应求的现象。他在交流会上已购进二十八亿多元的工业品，现正积极和各单位联系，准备再购进四十多亿元的工业品。大会还积极帮助灾区推销副业产品，仅河北省天津、沧县两专区受灾地区推销的草帽辫、布鞋、柳杆和苇箔就值三十一亿元。
    为适应各地对工业品的需要，中国百货公司上海、天津、广州等地的采购供应站也先后派了代表来参加大会交易。
    北京市铁路、保险和银行等部门都在会上设立了服务组。铁路部门还提出保证要把成交的产品迅速运输。　（新华社）
