Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China held a planning work conference from October 15th to November 3rd and determined the national geological work plan tasks for 1955. Based on the mineral reserves already obtained in the past two years and the requirements of the state's First Five-Year Plan for mineral resources, the planned tasks stipulate that in 1955, vigorous general survey work will be carried out to further expand the area of geological exploration, and efforts will be made to accelerate the completion of ongoing exploration projects. Regional geological surveys and geodetic surveys will be carried out with emphasis, geophysical prospecting will be developed, scientific research will be strengthened, and hydrogeological engineering work will be further strengthened. Based on these tasks, the conference formulated control figures for the Ministry of Geology system to compile various engineering plans for 1955, and studied measures to complete these tasks.

The meeting considered that the planned tasks for 1955 are very heavy, and the workload greatly exceeds that of 1954. However, in order to ensure the speed of national industrial development, it is necessary to overcome difficulties, tap potential strength, complete work tasks according to plan, and strive to complete more and greater workloads. The meeting requested that all geological departments, when compiling the 1955 plan, must fully consider the potential strength and favorable factors in all aspects, and widely mobilize the masses so that the plan is based on a solid and advanced foundation. The meeting criticized certain conservative ideas in the preparation of the plan. At the same time, the meeting required that the principle of thrift must be implemented in the compilation and execution of the 1955 plan, financial management must be strengthened, labor productivity must be improved, and the struggle against all kinds of extravagance and waste must be intensified.

    地质部确定一九五五年地质工作计划任务
    【新华社十二日讯】中华人民共和国地质部在十月十五日到十一月三日召开计划工作会议，确定了全国地质工作一九五五年的计划任务。根据过去两年来已获得的矿产储量情况和国家第一个五年计划对矿产资源的要求，计划任务规定一九五五年大力开展普查工作，进一步扩大地质勘探地区，争取加速完成正在进行的勘探项目。并有重点地进行区域地质测量和大地测量，发展地球物理探矿和加强科学研究，进一步加强水文工程地质工作。会议根据这些任务拟订了地质部系统编制一九五五年各项工程计划的控制数字，并研究了完成这些任务的措施。
    会议认为一九五五年计划任务十分繁重，工作量大大超过了一九五四年。但是为了保证国家工业发展速度，必须克服困难，挖掘潜在力量，按计划完成工作任务，并争取完成更多更大的工作量。会议要求各地质部门在编制一九五五年计划中必须充分考虑到各方面的潜在力量和有利因素，广泛发动群众以便使计划建立在切实可靠和先进的基础上。会议批判了编制计划中的某些保守思想。会议同时要求在编制和执行一九五五年计划中，必须贯彻节约的原则，必须加强财务管理工作，提高劳动生产率，和各种铺张浪费现象作斗争。
