The recent sentencing by China's Supreme People's Court of American spies Arnold, Downey, and Fecteau, who infiltrated China by air, to deserved legal sanctions has triggered hysterical howls and denials from the American aggressive bloc.

The cries and denials of the American aggressive bloc are to be expected. Just as the American aggressive bloc is trying its best to slander China for conducting so-called "subversive activities" in Asia, ironclad facts prove that it is the United States itself that is carrying out large-scale subversive activities. This is naturally a matter of great embarrassment.

However, it is not so easy for the American aggressive bloc to deny its crime of sending spies into China.

The American aggressive bloc insists that these two groups of American spies were prisoners of war in the Korean War, so it seems they should be repatriated in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, Arnold's plane was shot down in Liaoning Province, China, and Downey and Fecteau's plane was shot down in Jilin Province, China. How could American planes participating in the Korean War be shot down on Chinese territory? The American aggressive bloc has not been able to provide any explanation for this. Since the American spies were on American planes shot down within Chinese territory, and these spies have admitted that their mission was to come to China to carry out espionage activities, then the claim that these people are prisoners of war from the Korean War is nothing more than a smokescreen to deceive world public opinion.

What kind of "Korean War prisoners of war" are these American spies anyway? The American aggressive bloc obviously cannot explain it itself.

A spokesman for the U.S. Far East Air Force said on the 24th that Arnold's plane did not belong to the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," and that the planes of this wing "never flew over enemy territory" during the Korean War. However, he did not deny that Arnold was the colonel commander of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," nor did he deny that on Arnold's plane that was shot down, all eleven American airmen, except for Baumaugh, were from the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing."

This spokesman could not explain why a plane piloted by personnel from the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" did not belong to this wing; why the planes of this wing, which "never flew over enemy territory," flew over China. He obviously cannot explain how the personnel of this wing, which "never" participated in the Korean War, could become "Korean War prisoners of war"?

Regarding Downey and Fecteau, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement that the two were "civilian personnel employed" by the U.S. Army and that they were "approved passengers" on a plane that had a military contract with the Far East Air Force. They were "on a routine flight from Seoul to Japan."

However, the U.S. Far East Command Headquarters said that it had no files on these two "civilian personnel." Moreover, opening a map shows that both Seoul and Tokyo are south of 38 degrees north latitude, but the plane made a large turn of more than 90 degrees, flying not east but northwest, to Jilin Province, China, north of 42 degrees north latitude. This is another new "error" record for the U.S. Air Force, which is famous for "accidentally" dropping bombs in the Kaesong neutral zone.

Strangely, after this plane "disappeared," according to the United Press, the U.S. side only revealed the names of the pilot and co-pilot, and "for some unexplained reason" did not reveal that Downey and Fecteau were also on the plane. Until now, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the owner of Downey and Fecteau, has refused to comment on the matter of the two men.

These evasive tactics of the American aggressive bloc fully illustrate that Downey and Fecteau are by no means "Korean War prisoners of war," and their true identities and what they were doing when they flew to China are extremely shady.

Obviously, the American aggressive bloc cannot deny its crime of sending spies into China. In this case, what is there to shout about regarding the Chinese government's punishment of these spies according to law?

Is it still a secret to the world that the American aggressive bloc is conducting espionage activities against China? The American "Western Enterprises Company" located in Taiwan and the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the huge American Consulate General in Hong Kong, and the Atsugi spy agency of the American Central Intelligence Agency in Japan are all well-known bases for the United States to conduct espionage activities against China. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson publicly declared on September 18 this year that in the open, the United States will "continue to use strength or military force" and continue to use "trade sanctions" to deal with China. In the dark, the United States has not given up the "hope" that counter-revolutionaries will "liberate" China from the hands of the people's government. Arnold, Downey, Fecteau, and their ilk were captured by the Chinese people in the process of specifically implementing this subversive policy of the American aggressive bloc.

The American aggressive bloc is now shouting that because China has punished American spies, China should not participate in the United Nations. Some warmongers are even clamoring to use force against China. These cries can be used as footnotes to Robertson's words mentioned earlier. They prove how painstakingly the American aggressive bloc is working to antagonize the Chinese people, attempting to create tension in the Far East, overthrow the Chinese people's own government, and restore the counter-revolutionary rule of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in China. Therefore, these cries actually provide circumstantial evidence for the espionage activities carried out by the United States in China. The governments of certain countries are speaking with one voice with the American aggressive bloc, slandering China's action of punishing American spies as "extremely rude." This slander cannot but make people suspect that it has the same purpose as the American aggressive bloc.

The Chinese people are willing to live in peace with any country, but resolutely oppose any aggressive conspiracy against China. The Chinese people's punishment of American spies and exposure of the American aggressive conspiracy is not only to defend the security of the motherland, but also for the interests of peace in the Far East and the world. The American aggressive bloc should now realize from the capture of Arnold and Downey, Fecteau, and their ilk that in the face of the brave and intelligent Chinese people, any open or covert aggressive conspiracy is bound to be shamefully defeated.

### 美国颠覆中国的阴谋不容抵赖

    美国颠覆中国的阴谋不容抵赖
    新华社评论员　江南
    我国最高人民法院最近判处了由空中偷入我国的美国间谍阿诺德和唐奈、费克图等人以应得的法律制裁，这件事引起了美国侵略集团的歇斯底里的叫嚷和抵赖。
    美国侵略集团的叫嚷和抵赖是意料中的事。正当美国侵略集团竭力诬蔑中国在亚洲进行所谓“颠覆活动”的时候，铁的事实却证明了原来是美国自己在进行大规模的颠覆活动。这自然是太丢面子的事情。
    然而美国侵略集团要想抵赖它派遣间谍偷入中国的罪行，却不是那么容易的事情。
    美国侵略集团硬说这两批美国间谍都是朝鲜战争中的战俘，所以好像应该按照朝鲜停战协定将他们遣返。然而阿诺德所乘的飞机是在中国的辽宁省被击落的，唐奈和费克图所乘的飞机是在中国的吉林省被击落的。参加朝鲜战争的美国飞机，怎么会在中国领土上被击落的呢？关于这一点，美国侵略集团却没有能作任何解释。既然是在中国境内被击落的美国飞机上的美国间谍，而且这些间谍已经承认他们的任务就是到中国来进行间谍活动，那末，所谓这些人是朝鲜战争的战俘的说法，只不过是用来欺骗世界舆论的烟幕罢了。
    这些美国间谍究竟算是什么样的“朝鲜战争的战俘”呢？美国侵略集团显然自己也说不出个道理来。
    美国远东空军的发言人在二十四日说，阿诺德所乘的飞机不是属于“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的，而且说这个联队的飞机在朝鲜战争中“从来不曾飞到敌方的领土上空”。但是他并没有否认阿诺德是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官，也没有否认在被击落的阿诺德的飞机上，全部十一名美国空军人员，除了包莫一人以外，其余十个人都是属于“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的。
    这位发言人无法解释为什么由“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的人员驾驶的飞机却不属于这个联队；为什么这个“从来不曾飞到敌方的领土上空”的联队的飞机却飞到了中国上空，他显然无法说明：这个“从来不曾”参加朝鲜战争的联队的人员怎么会成为“朝鲜战争的战俘”？
    关于唐奈和费克图，美国国防部在一个声明里面说，这两人是美国陆军“雇用的文职人员”，他们是在一架与远东空军订有军事合同的飞机上的被
  “核准的乘客”，他们当时“正在作从汉城到日本的例行飞行”。
    但是远东美军总部说，它没有关于这两个“文职人员”的档案。而且打开地图就可以看到，汉城和东京都在北纬三十八度以南，可是这架飞机却转了
  一个九十度以上的大弯，不是向东而是向西北，飞到北纬四十二度以北的中国吉林省来了。这对于以在开城中立区“投错”炸弹出名的美国空军来说，倒又是一项新的“错误”纪录。
    奇怪的是在这架飞机“失踪”以后，据合众社说，美国方面只透露了飞机上驾驶员和副驾驶员的姓名，“为了某些仍未说明的原因”，没有透露这架飞机上还有唐奈和费克图两个人。直到现在，唐奈和费克图的主人美国中央情报局还拒绝对他们两人的事表示意见。
    美国侵略集团的这些遮遮掩掩的手法，充分说明唐奈和费克图两个人根本谈不上是什么“朝鲜战争的战俘”，他们的真实身份和他们飞到中国来干的勾当都是极其见不得人的。
    很明显，美国侵略集团无法抵赖派遣间谍偷入中国的罪行。在这种情况下，对于中国政府根据法律惩办这些间谍，还有什么可以叫嚷的呢？
    美国侵略集团对中国进行间谍活动，对于全世界说来，难道还是什么秘密么？设在蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的台湾和沿海岛屿上的美国的“西方企业公司”，设在香港的庞大的美国总领事馆，设在日本的美国中央情报局的厚木间谍机关，这些都是众所周知的美国对中国进行间谍活动的大本营。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在今年九月十八日还曾经公开宣称：在明的方面美国将“继续以实力或军事实力的态势”、继续以“贸易制裁”来对付中国，在暗的方面，美国并没有放弃这样的“希望”：这就是反革命分子将把中国从人民政权手中“解放”出来。阿诺德、唐奈、费克图之流就是在具体执行美国侵略集团这种颠覆政策的过程中被中国人民捕获的。
    美国侵略集团现在叫嚷说，因为中国惩办了美国间谍，所以中国更不应该参加联合国。某些好战分子甚至叫嚣要对中国使用武力。这些叫嚷都可以作为前面提到过的罗伯逊的话的注脚，它们证明美国侵略集团是如何处心积虑地与中国人民为敌，企图在远东制造紧张局势，推翻中国人民自己的政权，在中国恢复美国和蒋介石卖国集团的反革命统治。因此，这些叫嚷实际上就为美国在中国进行的间谍活动提供了旁证。某些国家的政府和美国侵略集团一鼻孔出气，诬蔑中国惩办美国间谍的行动是
  “非常无礼的”。这种诬蔑不能不使人怀疑它和美国侵略集团抱有同样的目的。
    中国人民愿意和任何国家和平共处，但是坚决反对任何对于中国的侵略阴谋。中国人民惩办美国间谍，揭露美国的侵略阴谋，不仅是为了保卫祖国的安全，也是为了远东和世界和平的利益。美国侵略集团现在应该从阿诺德和唐奈、费克图之流的被捕获认识到，在勇敢而智慧的中国人民面前，任何明的或是暗的侵略阴谋，都必然要遭到可耻的失败。
