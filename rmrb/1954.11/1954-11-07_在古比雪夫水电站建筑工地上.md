    At the Construction Site of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station
    By N. Latsin, Chief Engineer of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau of the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize Winner

    On the banks of the great Russian Volga River, at the Zhiguli Mountains' pass, the Soviet people are carrying out the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, building the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station.

  The construction site and affiliated production enterprises of the "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau" stretch for tens of kilometers. The scale of construction is expanding year by year.

    The thousands of employees of the "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau" have overcome numerous difficulties and have essentially completed one of the most important tasks: creating the conditions for the construction of the massive hydraulic engineering projects, such as the locks, spillway dams, and hydroelectric power station buildings in the upstream and downstream sections. More than 600 kilometers of railways and highways have been laid, connecting the various construction sites and production enterprises. Seven hundred kilometers of power transmission lines have been erected, and dozens of substations and transformers have been established, forming a powerful power system capable of operating a wide variety of machinery.

    In order to complete the large volume of concrete at the construction site and utilize the stone from the local mountains, five powerful gravel factories have been established, capable of producing more than 10,000 cubic meters of stone and gravel per day. The stone produced by these factories is transported by rail and aerial cableways. Currently, there are two aerial cableways, each over six kilometers long, carrying out transportation work. One of these cableways spans the Volga River, connecting the concrete factory on the left bank with the gravel factory on the right bank. Nine concrete manufacturing factories, each capable of producing 2,000 cubic meters of concrete per day, have been established at the construction site, ensuring the supply of the necessary amount of concrete.

    To build the many solid reinforced concrete hydraulic structures of the hydroelectric station, a large number of various metal structures are required. These metal structures are manufactured by two large steel bar processing factories equipped with the latest Soviet welding machines, steel bar bending machines, and other machines. Each of these two factories can process 700 tons of steel bars per day. In addition, there are two specialized factories that manufacture prefabricated reinforced concrete panels for covering the exterior of the buildings.

    In order to ensure continuous construction on the main buildings, the builders have built a cofferdam with a total length of about sixteen kilometers to prevent the water of the Volga River from flowing into the foundation pit. The height of the cofferdam reaches twenty-five meters in some places. The problem of groundwater in the foundation pit is solved by a large-scale, circular deep well drainage system, which uses more than 700 specialized water pumps.

    The builders of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station possess highly productive construction machinery produced in the Soviet Union. More than 2,000 different types of machines, mechanical equipment, and equipment are used at the construction site. We use dredgers with a production efficiency of 1,000 cubic meters per hour, excavators that can dig three cubic meters of earth per time, dump trucks with a load capacity of 25 tons, mobile cranes, cable cranes, tower cranes, large tractors, bulldozers, and scrapers. In order to mechanize the work of transporting concrete to the concrete pouring surface, a viaduct for transporting concrete has been erected, equipped with mobile cranes and vibrating elephant trunks with a lifting capacity of ten tons. Thanks to the abundant machinery and equipment, the degree of mechanization of earthwork and concrete work has reached 98 to 99 percent.

    In the past period, nearly 80 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed on the construction site. More than 2 million cubic meters of concrete have been poured on the hydroelectric power station building, locks, and spillway dam. Nearly 25,000 tons of steel sheet piles have been driven under the cofferdam of the foundation pit and under the foundation of the spillway dam and locks.

    The work of pouring concrete and reinforced concrete, which began in 1953, is currently proceeding at a faster pace on all buildings. This year, the monthly concrete pouring volume has reached 250,000 cubic meters, and sometimes even 263,000 cubic meters. No other construction site in the Soviet Union has been able to achieve such a speed of concrete pouring.

    The outline of the most important project in the hydraulic hub—the hydroelectric power station—is becoming increasingly clear. The foundation floor under the pier of the spillway dam has been completely poured with concrete. Currently, the steel bars, metal facing, the bearing seats on the pier, the protective panels of the pier, the water pipes for power generation, and the walls of the underground part of the hydroelectric power station building are being installed. The steel skeleton of the outer assembly workshop of the hydroelectric power station building has already been erected, and bridge cranes are now being installed for future installation of the water turbines.

    Construction is currently underway on the first batch of buildings to be used in the hydraulic hub—the several navigation locks in the downstream section. In the spring of 1955, the first ships passing through the Volga River will pass through these locks. 500,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete have been poured on these reinforced concrete structures with a design capacity of 600,000 cubic meters. The builders of the locks are installing the bearing seat parts of the lock gates, building the upper part of the lock abutments, and preparing to install the lock gates and rotating machinery.

    The construction of the spillway dam is proceeding smoothly. More than 300,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured on the bottom plate of the downstream revetment and stilling basin, as well as on the stilling basin and the overflow part of the dam.

    Preparations for closing the old riverbed of the Volga River began this summer. This important task will be completed in the summer of 1955.

  The "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau" has done a lot of work in creating good living and housing conditions for the builders. New towns and workers' villages have appeared on the construction site—"Komsomol," "Zhiguli," "Markwash," "Poltava," etc. The total area of these residential areas is close to 400,000 square meters. Seven clubs, two cultural palaces, thirteen middle schools, and many other public life buildings have been built for the staff of the construction site.

    During the past period of project implementation, a strong and well-organized collective has been trained in the "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau." The names of many advanced workers on our construction site have spread throughout the country. These include excavator operators, Communist Party members Mikhail Yevetz and Vasily Krementyev, builders of the Volga-Don Canal, Labor Heroes of Socialism Ivan Yermolenko and Vladimir Myachev, Vasily Skura, Nikolai Borodin. Car drivers Ilya Muzlov and Peter Yusko, as well as many other well-known producers, enjoy honor.

    Due to the high indicators achieved in the work, the Soviet Council of Ministers awarded the mobile red flag to the employees of this hydraulic hub station.

    The hydraulic engineering construction personnel have widely launched a socialist competition to gloriously welcome the 37th anniversary of the Great October Revolution. The advanced employees of the construction site are reporting that they have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. This year, the personnel in charge of hydraulic filling work have achieved a major victory. They completed the earthwork project plan with a scale of more than 2.1 million cubic meters ahead of schedule on October 24.

    The construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station has entered the most important stage of work. Next year, we must put the first water turbines into operation. To this end, we must complete a large amount of concrete building construction work, complete the closure of the old riverbed and the end of the earth dam construction, and carry out complex installation work. With the constant help of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the entire Soviet people, all employees of the "Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Bureau" are gloriously completing the tasks entrusted to them. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is scheduled to supply electricity to our country's industry in 1955.

    在俄罗斯的伟大的伏尔加河两岸，在日古梁山的山口，苏联人执行着苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的指令，正在建筑世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站。
  “古比雪夫水电站建筑工程处”的建筑工地和所属各生产企业绵延达数十公里。建筑规模正在逐年扩大着。
    “古比雪夫水电站建筑工程处”的数千名员工克服了大量困难，他们已基本上完成了最重要的任务之一——为建筑上下流段的几个船闸、溢水坝和水电站厂房等这些巨大水利工程创造了施工的条件。已经铺设了六百多公里的铁路和公路，这些铁路和公路把各建筑工地和生产企业连接起来。已经架设了七百公里的输电线，建立了数十个变电站和变压器，这样就形成一个强有力的、能运转各式各样机器的动力系统。
    为了完成建筑工地上大量的混凝土方，并采用当地山上的石料已建立了五个强大的碎石工厂，每昼夜能产一万多公方的石头和碎石。这些工厂所出产的石料是由铁路和架空索道来运输的。目前已有两条总长达六公里以上的架空索道在进行输送工作。其中的一条索道横跨伏尔加河，把左岸的混凝土工厂同右岸的碎石工厂连接起来。在建筑工地上已建立了九个每昼夜各能生产混凝土达两千公方的混凝土制造工厂，这几个工厂保证了必要数量的混凝土的供应。
    为了建造水电站上许多坚固的钢筋混凝土水工建筑物，需要有大量的各种各样的金属结构。这些金属结构是由装备有苏联最新式的焊接机、钢筋弯曲机和其他机器的两个大型的钢筋加工工厂来制造的。这两个工厂每昼夜各能加工七百吨钢筋。此外为了覆盖建筑物的外部另有两个专门的工厂来制造钢筋混凝土预制板。
    为了在主要建筑物上能进行连续不断的施工，建筑者们已经用土筑起了一道总长度约十六公里的围堰，以防止伏尔加河的水流入基坑。围堰的高度在某些地方达到了二十五公尺高。基坑的地下水问题是由一个大规模的、环形深井排水系统来解决的，这里使用着七百多种专用的水泵。
    古比雪夫水电站的建筑者们拥有苏联出产的高度生产效能的建筑机器。在建筑工地上使用着两千种以上的各种不同的机器、机械和装备。我们使用着每小时生产效率为一千公方的吸泥机、每次能挖三公方土的掘土机、载重二十五吨的自卸卡车、移动起重机、吊索起重机、塔形起重机、大型的拖拉机、推土机、铲土机。为了使运输混凝土到混凝土浇灌面的工作机械化，特架设了运送混凝土的高架桥，在高架桥上装有起重十吨的移动起重机和振动象鼻管。由于拥有丰富的机器设备，土方和混凝土工程的机械化程度达到了百分之九十八到九十九。
    在过去一段时期中，工地上已完成了近八千万公方的土工。在水电站厂房、船闸和溢水坝上，已浇灌了两百多万公方的混凝土。在基坑的围堰下和溢水坝及船闸的基础下，已打入了总重近二万五千吨的钢板桩。
    一九五三年开始的混凝土和钢筋混凝土浇灌工作，目前正以更快的速度在所有建筑物上进行。今年，每月浇灌的混凝土达二十五万公方，有时候甚至达到二十六万三千公方。苏联任何一个建筑工地的混凝土浇灌工作都还没有能达到这样的速度。
    水力枢纽中的最主要工程——水电站的轮廓已越来越明显了。溢水坝上闸墩下的基础底板已完全浇灌了混凝土。目前正在安装着闸墩中的钢筋、金属护面，闸墩上的轴座，闸墩的护面板，发电用的水管及水电站厂房地下部分的墙壁。目前水电站厂房外面装配工场上的钢骨架已经搭起来了，现在正在装置桥形起重机以便将来安装水轮机。
    在水力枢纽第一批使用的建筑物上——即下流段几个通航船闸上，目前正在紧张地进行着施工。一九五五年春季，首批通过伏尔加河的船只将经过这些船闸。在这些钢筋混凝土设计容量为六十万公方的建筑物上已浇灌了五十万公方的钢筋混凝土。水闸的建筑者们正在安装船闸闸门的轴座部分，建造船闸岸壁的上部，并准备安装船闸的闸门和转动机械。
    溢水坝的施工正在顺利进行着。在溢水坝下护堤和静水池的底板上，以及在静水池上和坝的溢流部分已经浇灌了三十万公方以上的混凝土。
    今年夏天已开始了封闭伏尔加河旧河床的准备工作。这一重要任务将在一九五五年夏季完成。
      “古比雪夫水电站建筑工程处”在为建筑者们创造良好的生活和居住条件方面已进行了许多的工作。在建筑工地上已出现了新的市镇和工人村——“青年团”、“日古梁”、“马尔克瓦什”、“波尔塔瓦”等，这些住宅区的总面积已接近四十万平方公尺。已经为工地的工作人员建筑了七个俱乐部，两所文化宫，十三所中学和其他许多公共生活建筑物。
    在过去这段工程进行时期，在“古比雪夫水电站建筑工程处”已经锻炼出了一个坚强的、组织得很好的集体。我们建设工地的许多先进者的名字已传遍全国。这些人有掘土机手、共产党员米哈依尔·叶维茨和华西里·克列缅捷夫，伏尔加河顿河运河的建造者、社会主义劳动英雄伊凡·叶尔莫连科和弗拉季米尔·米亚切夫、华西里·斯古拉、尼古拉·波罗金。汽车司机伊利亚·穆兹洛夫和彼得·尤斯柯以及其他许多著名的生产者都享有荣誉。
    由于工作中所达到的高度指标，苏联部长会议以流动红旗授给了这个水力枢纽站的员工们。
    水利工程建筑人员们已广泛展开了为光荣地迎接伟大十月革命节三十七周年的社会主义竞赛。建筑工地的先进员工们正在报告他们已提前完成年度计划。今年，水力冲填工作的人员取得了重大胜利。他们在十月二十四日就提前完成了规模在二千一百公方以上的土方工程计划。
    古比雪夫水电站的建筑工程已进入了最重要的工作阶段。明年，我们必须使首批水轮机开动起来。为此我们就必须完成大量的混凝土建筑物的施工工作，完成封闭旧河床和结束土坝施工，并进行复杂的安装工作。在苏共中央、苏联政府以及全体苏联人民的经常帮助下，“古比雪夫水电站建筑工程处”的全体员工正在光荣地完成他们所担负的任务。古比雪夫水电站已定于一九五五年供应我国工业的用电。
