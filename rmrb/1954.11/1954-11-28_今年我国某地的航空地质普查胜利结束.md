    This Year’s Aerial Geological Survey in a Certain Area of Our Country Has Victoriously Concluded
    [This newspaper reports] Our country’s aerial geological survey work conducted this year in a certain area has victoriously concluded.
    Using airplanes to find mineral resources—aerial magnetic surveying is an advanced Soviet geological survey method. Last autumn, the Ministry of Geology and the Civil Aviation Administration used airplanes to conduct experiments over a certain mining area that had already been discovered. This year, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Ministry of Geology and the Civil Aviation Administration continued to commence experimental production flights in a certain area, surveying an area of nearly 10,000 square kilometers. This work was victoriously concluded in the early part of this month, obtaining a great deal of valuable geological data, providing important clues for ground prospecting teams and geological mapping. The quality of this year’s work improved by nearly two times compared to last year, laying a good foundation for carrying out large-scale aerial geological surveys in the future.
    Aerial magnetic surveying has many advantages: first, it is fast and saves money. An airplane can survey tens of thousands of square kilometers in a year, which can save the country a lot of manpower and funds; second, airplanes can work in high mountains and places with inconvenient transportation, and are not affected by magnetic objects such as railways and high-voltage lines on the ground. These advantages have been confirmed in this year’s actual work.
    This year’s aerial magnetic surveying work received strong support and assistance from the Party organization and government of a certain area during its preparation and implementation. After the airplane arrived in the work area, it greatly encouraged the people's confidence in building socialism. Old worker Wang Youliang said after visiting the airplane: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are doing a really good job. Airplanes can find minerals buried underground in the sky!" Grain company employee Shen Liancai said: "Our construction is developing so fast that we can already use airplanes to explore for minerals. We must do a good job in grain supply and support you to find more minerals for the country."

    今年我国某地的航空地质普查胜利结束
    【本报讯】今年我国在某地进行的航空地质普查工作已经胜利结束。
    用飞机寻找矿源——航空磁测是苏联先进的地质普查方法。去年秋季地质部和民用航空局用飞机在已发现的某矿区上空进行过试验。今年地质部和民用航空局继续在苏联专家指导下，在某地开始了试验性的生产飞行，勘测面积近一万平方公里。这一工作已经在本月上旬胜利结束，获得了不少宝贵的地质资料，为地面探矿队和地质填图提供了重要线索。今年的工作质量比去年提高了将近二倍，为今后展开大规模的航空地质普查打下了良好的基础。
    航空磁测有许多优点：首先是快和省，一架飞机一年内可普查数万平方公里的面积，能为国家节省大量的人力和经费；其次是高山峻岭和交通不便的地方，用飞机同样可以进行工作，并不受地面带有磁性物体的铁道、高压线等的干扰。这些优点已经在今年的实际工作中得到证实。
    今年航空磁测工作在筹备和进行期间得到了某地党组织和政府的大力支持和帮助。飞机到达工作地区后，大大地鼓舞了人民群众建设社会主义的信心。老工人王有良参观飞机后说：“共产党、毛主席领导得真好，飞机在天上就能找到埋在地下的矿啦！”粮食公司沈连才说：“我们的建设事业发展得真快，已经可以用飞机探矿了。我们一定要做好粮食供应工作，支援你们，为国家多找些矿”。
