    Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, Grain Department Promptly Inspects Newly Stored Grain
    In Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, national grain depots in various localities accepted a batch of new grain in July and August; now, autumn agricultural tax collection and unified grain purchase work have been launched in various localities, and large quantities of grain are continuously entering the warehouses. In order to do a good job in the storage of new grain, grain depots in various localities carried out a general grain survey in mid-to-late October, and, in coordination with the new grain storage work, promptly processed a large batch of grain that was in danger of mildew and rot.
    The method adopted by the grain depots in Nanchang County for this general grain survey was "collecting, inspecting, and processing simultaneously." The Sixth Grain Depot divided its staff into four groups, with one group specializing in grain procurement, while the remaining three groups were responsible for conducting the general grain survey, sun-drying grain that was in danger of mildew and rot, and surveying seed grain. The Eighth Grain Depot formulated specific plans for grain collection and storage, organized storage cadres to inspect stored grain with each other, and carried out the ranking of safe grain and grain in danger of mildew and rot. Through the general survey, the grain depots discovered many problems. For example, the temperature of some grain in the Tenth Grain Depot was as high as 44 degrees Celsius; mildew and rot had already appeared in the Sixth and Seventh Grain Depots. After discovering these situations, the grain depots promptly processed them. The Sixth Grain Depot has already processed more than 477,000 jin of grain that was in danger of mildew and rot. The Eighth Grain Depot used methods such as ventilation and trenching to reduce the temperature and moisture content of the grain; at the same time, it isolated and winnowed grain in each warehouse that was severely infested with insects, and also used various methods to lure and kill grain insects to reduce the degree of insect damage to grain with slight insect infestation.
    In order to further improve grain storage work, many grain depots have improved storage systems and assigned special personnel to inspect grain quality and other tasks. The First Grain Depot proposed to achieve "inspection of all grain" and "prompt handling of discovered problems." The Twelfth Grain Depot stipulated that during the autumn grain storage period, stored grain should be inspected every three days for small issues, every seven days for major issues, and tested every half month. The Sixth Grain Depot also established an inspection system for grain stored on behalf of supply and marketing cooperatives. (Hu Xingye)

    江西省南昌县粮食部门及时检查入库新粮
    江西省南昌县各地国家粮库在七、八月间就接受了一批新粮；现在各地已经展开农业税秋征工作和粮食统购工作，大批粮食正在源源入库。各地粮库为了作好新粮保管工作，在十月中、下旬开展了粮食普查运动，并配合新粮入库工作，及时处理了大批有霉烂危险的粮食。
    南昌县各粮库这次普查粮食的作法是“边收，边查，边处理”。第六粮库把工作人员分成四组，除留下一组专门进行粮食收购工作外，其余三组分别负责普查粮食，整晒有霉烂危险的粮食，普查种籽粮。第八粮库订出了征粮购粮和保管粮食的具体计划，分片组织保管干部互相检查存粮，并进行安全粮食和有霉烂危险的粮食的排队工作。通过普查，各粮库发现了不少问题。如第十粮库的一部分粮食温度高达摄氏四十四度；第六、第七粮库已经出现了霉烂的粮食。各粮库发现这些情况以后，及时进行处理。第六粮库已经处理有霉烂危险的粮食四十七万七千多斤。第八粮库用通风扒沟等办法，降低了粮食的温度和水分；同时把各仓虫害严重的粮食加以隔离和风筛，对虫害轻微的粮食也用各种诱杀仓虫的办法，减轻仓虫为害的程度。
    为了进一步作好粮食保管工作，许多粮库健全了保管制度，指定专人，进行检查粮质等工作。第一粮库提出要作到“有粮必查”和“发现问题，及时处理”。第十二粮库规定在秋粮入库期间，对存粮要作到三天一小查，七天一大查，半月化验一次。第六粮库还建立了对供销合作社代存粮食的检查制度。　　　　　（胡兴业）
