    Guangdong Provincial Fishery Supply and Marketing Cooperative Established
    The Guangdong Provincial Fishery Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established on October 20th.
    Over the past four years, Guangdong Province has established more than 130 fishery production cooperative organizations, with over 222,000 members. The main tasks of these fishery production cooperative organizations are to supply fishing production materials and daily necessities to fishermen members, and to transport and sell fish on their behalf. Especially for fishermen on islands far from the mainland, almost all daily necessities and the transportation and sale of fish rely on the cooperative. From January of last year to September of this year, the cooperative organization in Zhuhai County supplied fishing production materials and daily necessities worth 38 billion yuan to 30,000 fishermen. In the past, these supply and marketing cooperative organizations played a significant role in supporting the restoration of fishery production in the province and promoting the organization of fishermen. After the establishment of the provincial fishery supply and marketing cooperative, it will be able to better serve the fishermen. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省渔业供销合作社成立
    广东省渔业供销合作社在十月二十日成立。
    广东省四年来已建立了一百三十多个渔业生产合作组织，拥有社员二十二万二千多人。这些渔业生产合作组织的主要任务，是供应渔民社员渔业生产资料和生活必需品，并代运代销鱼。尤其是远离大陆的海岛渔民，几乎全部生活必需品和代运代销鱼都依靠合作社。珠海县的合作组织从去年一月到今年九月，就为三万渔民供应了价值三百八十亿元的渔业生产资料和生活必需品。过去这些供销合作组织在支援全省渔业生产的恢复和促进渔民组织起来起了很大的作用。全省渔业供销合作社成立后，将能更好地为渔民服务。　（新华社）
