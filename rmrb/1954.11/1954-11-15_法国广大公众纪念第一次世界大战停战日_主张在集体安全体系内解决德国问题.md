Xinhua News Agency, November 12th, dispatch from Paris via TASS: On the 11th, the French public commemorated the 36th anniversary of the armistice agreement signed with Germany at the end of World War I. The French public commemorated this day under the slogan of strengthening the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany. For example, the French Federation of Veterans and War Invalids, with three million members, called on all citizens to mourn the victims of the two world wars and to oppose the revival of German militarism.

Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, wrote in "L'Humanité": On this day, November 11, 1954, the French people, aware of the threats they face, are protesting the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. The French people are participating in the struggle waged by the working people and democrats of West Germany against Adenauer's policies. Also participating in this struggle is the German Democratic Republic, which firmly opposes the revival of German militarism.

Xinhua News Agency, November 13th, dispatch from Paris via TASS: November 11th marked the 36th anniversary of the signing of the armistice agreement of World War I. On this day, mass demonstrations and memorial services were held in cities and villages throughout France to commemorate the French who sacrificed themselves in the wars against Imperial Germany and Hitler's Germany.

At almost all of these gatherings, the recommendation of the French Veterans Federation was read out, stating: The French Veterans Federation reiterates its opposition to the revival of German militarism in any form. It advocates solving the German question within the framework of a collective security system that would provide the conditions for general, gradual, simultaneous and supervised disarmament. It advocates rejecting all measures that would intensify the arms race, as the arms race would render meaningless negotiations on establishing lasting peace in Europe and the world.

The recommendation of the French Veterans Federation was unanimously adopted at memorial services held in the town hall of the 1st arrondissement of Paris, Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, Villejuif, and other cities and villages.

On the same day, Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the French National Assembly and Mayor of Lyon, received representatives of the French Veterans Federation. The representatives expressed their determination to continue fighting against the remilitarization of West Germany. Herriot expressed his complete agreement with their position, stating that he advocated the conclusion of a collective security treaty.

    法国广大公众纪念第一次世界大战停战日
    主张在集体安全体系内解决德国问题
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：十一日，法国公众纪念第一次世界大战同德国签订停战协定三十六周年。法国公众在加强反对武装西德的斗争的口号下纪念这个日子。例如，拥有三百万会员的法国退伍军人与战争残废者联合会号召全体公民悼念两次世界大战的牺牲者，并反对复活德国军国主义。
    法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛在“人道报”上写道：这一天，一九五四年十一月十一日，法国人民意识到他们面临着的威胁，纷纷表示抗议批准伦敦协定和巴黎协定。法国人民参加西德劳动人民和民主人士所进行的反对阿登纳政策的斗争。参加这一斗争的还有坚决反对复活德国军国主义的德意志民主共和国。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：十一月十一日是第一次世界大战停战协定签订三十六周年纪念日。这一天，法国全国各城市和乡村都举行群众示威和追悼大会，追悼那些在反抗德皇和希特勒德国的战争中牺牲的法国人。
    几乎在所有这些集会上都宣读了法兰西退伍军人联盟的建议，这个建议说：法兰西退伍军人联盟重申：它反对以任何形式复活德国军国主义。它主张在集体安全体系的范围内解决德国问题，这个集体安全体系会提供普遍地、逐步地、同时而有监督地裁减军备的条件。它主张拒绝使军备竞赛加紧的一切措施，因为军备竞赛会使关于在欧洲和全世界建立持久和平的谈判变得毫无意义。
    在巴黎第一区市政厅、圣但尼、奥伯维依耶、维尔尤夫和其他城市及乡村举行的追悼大会上，都一致通过了法兰西退伍军人联盟这个建议。
    同日，法国国民议会荣誉议长、里昂市长赫里欧接见了法兰西退伍军人联盟的代表。代表们表示要继续为反对西德重新军国主义化而斗争。赫里欧表示完全同意他们的立场。他说，他主张缔结集体安全条约。
