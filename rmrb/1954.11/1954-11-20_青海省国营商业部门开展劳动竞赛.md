    青海省国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛
    国营商业部门的增产节约劳动竞赛在青海省也展开了。
    现在正是青海省城乡物资交流的旺季。国营商业部门除大量收购毛皮、羊肠、油脂、油料等农、畜产品外，还收购鹿皮、黄羊皮等新产品和重要药材。到十月底，黄南藏族自治区已收购羊毛六十多万斤。
    为供应首都和大城市的肉食需要，海南藏族自治区到十月下旬已购到羊五万多只。
    中国百货公司青海省公司职工开展劳动竞赛后，十月份超额百分之七点四六完成了计划。配合农产品的收购，组织了农村需要调查访问组。带了三百多种为农民喜爱的冬季商品和库存商品表及第四季度进货目录，到化隆、循化、贵德等地举行小型商品展览会。访问组还和当地贸易支公司、供销合作社职工举行座谈，帮助制订要货计划。经过重新制订的要货计划比原计划共增加十七亿元左右。
