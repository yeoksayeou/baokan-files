    Doing a good job in checking seedlings and replanting wheat is a crucial key to ensuring the wheat harvest next year.
    Because the area of ​​wheat planting after dehydration is large this year, the late autumn ripening is slow in these areas, the wheat planting time is tight, and the sowing quality is generally low. Some areas also encountered drought when sowing, with large clods, uneven sowing, and heavy rain after sowing, causing soil compaction, which affected the emergence of wheat seedlings. In some areas, continuous rain during the wheat harvest season last year resulted in poor ripening and low seed germination rate, which affected full seedling emergence. In addition, there are more underground pests this year than in previous years. Therefore, the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows in wheat fields is common and serious. In the suburbs of Shangqiu County, Henan Province, the general rate of missing seedlings reached 50%. In Fugou County, a survey of 25 mu of wheat fields showed that 14 mu had a missing seedling rate of 70%. In the first district of Xincheng County, Hebei Province, half of the 1,800 mu of wheat fields in six agricultural production cooperatives suffered from mole cricket damage. Similar situations also exist in Shandong and Shanxi provinces. If measures are not taken to remedy this as soon as possible, it will seriously affect wheat production next year. To this end, in addition to focusing on completing the wheat planting task, local leaders must pay close attention to the problem of missing seedlings, promptly organize forces, and deeply mobilize the masses to carry out wheat seedling checking and replanting work. Recently, Anyang County, Henan Province, launched a "four checks and one guarantee" campaign, checking for bare ground, broken rows, large ridges, and insect pests, requiring the rapid replenishment of missing seedlings to ensure full seedling emergence. Shaanxi Province also promptly issued an emergency notice for checking seedlings and replanting. This approach is entirely timely and necessary.
    Based on the experience of various regions in carrying out seedling checking and replanting in previous years, the ideological mobilization work must first be done well. Cadres must go deep into the fields, investigate the situation, grasp the materials, understand the thinking of the masses, and take methods such as accounting and comparison to make the masses realize the important significance of striving for full seedling emergence and reverse the masses' thinking that "70% to 80% counts as full seedling emergence, and sparse plants produce large ears." In Cui Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, District One, Xiong County, Hebei Province, about 5% of the 2,400 mu of wheat fields were missing seedlings. When replanting was initiated, some members thought, "What's the big deal about missing so few seedlings? Replanting is too much trouble." The president used the method of detailed accounting to make the members realize that if the missing seedlings were not replanted, it would be equivalent to planting 120 mu less of wheat fields. This cleared the members' thinking and mobilized replanting, eliminating more than 10,000 large and small broken rows.
    Secondly, the seedling checking and replanting work must be carried out in response to the causes of missing seedlings and adopt different methods according to the specific local conditions: 1. When missing seedlings occur in patches or sections due to uneven sowing, underground pests, or poor seed germination, the same wheat seeds should be used for replanting immediately. If the season is late, the seeds can be sprouted first until the tips of the sprouts are slightly exposed before planting. After emergence, topdressing fertilizer should be applied appropriately at the replanting site to promote uniform growth. 2. If the soil is not compacted, and the seeds are suspended in the air and fail to germinate, the method of rolling and pressing can be used to make the seeds closely contact the soil and promote germination. 3. For water-dehydrated land sown with plow blades, if there is water in the furrows after sowing, do not cover the soil temporarily. Wait until the accumulated water in the furrows seeps down before covering the soil to prevent seed rot. After emergence, hoeing should be done in time to loosen the soil and preserve moisture. 4. For wheat fields where the soil is compacted after sowing due to rain, making it difficult for wheat seedlings to emerge, a hand rake can be used to lightly loosen the surface soil.
    There is a certain time limit for checking seedlings and replanting. All regions must take immediate action to check seedlings and replant to ensure full seedling emergence. In areas where sowing has been completed but seedlings have not yet emerged, vigilance should be heightened and preparations should be made for replanting. In areas where sowing has not yet begun, special attention should be paid to soil preparation, sowing techniques, and pest control. Sowing should be done in a timely manner to strive for full seedling emergence and lay the foundation for increased wheat production next year.

    做好小麦的查苗补苗工作
    争取麦田全苗，是保证明年小麦收成的重要关键。
    由于今年脱水种麦的面积大，这些地区晚秋成熟迟，种麦时间紧，播种质量一般都低；有些地区播种时又遇天旱，坷拉大，种不匀，种后又遇大雨，土壤板结，影响麦苗出土；还有些地区由于去年麦收季节霪雨连绵，成熟不好，麦种发芽率低，影响全苗；加以今年地下害虫亦较往年多，因而麦田缺苗断垅现象普遍而严重。河南商邱县郊区一般缺苗达百分之五十，扶沟县调查二十五亩麦田中有十四亩缺苗达百分之七十。河北新城县一区六个农业生产合作社一千八百多亩麦田中有半数发生蝼蛄虫害；山东、山西等省也有类似情况。如不及早设法补救，将会严重影响明年小麦产量。为此，各地领导上除抓紧完成种麦任务外，必须密切注意缺苗问题，及时组织力量，深入动员群众，开展小麦查苗补种工作。最近河南省安阳县开展了“四查一保”运动，查白地，查断条，查大垅，查虫害，要求迅速补足缺苗，保证全苗；陕西省亦及时发出了查苗补种的紧急通知。这种做法，是完全适时和必要的。
    根据往年各地开展查苗补种的经验，首先必须做好思想发动工作。干部必须深入田间，查明情况，掌握材料，摸清群众思想，采取算账、对比等办法，使群众认识争取全苗的重要意义，扭转群众“七、八成算全苗，稀棵莠大穗”的思想。河北省雄县一区崔村农业生产合作社二千四百亩麦田，缺苗约百分之五左右，当发动补苗时，有些社员认为：“缺这么点怕什么，补苗多麻烦”，社长就用算细账方法，使社员认识到缺苗如果不补齐，就等于少种一百二十亩麦田，这样就打通了社员思想，发动了补种，消灭了大小断垅一万多处。
    其次，查苗补种工作，必须针对缺苗原因，根据当地具体情况采用不同办法：一、因播种不匀、地下害虫咬毁或种子发芽不良成片成段缺苗时，要迅即用同样麦种进行补种。如季节已晚，可先将种子进行催芽，使微露芽尖后再种。出土后要在补苗处适当多施追肥，促使生长整齐一致。二、如因土不塌实，种子悬空落干而未能出芽的，可采用砘压的办法，使种子与土壤密接，促其发芽。三、水脱地用犁刀办法播种的，播种后如沟内有水，可暂时不要盖土，等沟内积水下渗，再行盖土，防止烂种，出苗后要及时锄麦松土保墒。四、播种后遇雨土壤板结的麦田，麦苗不易出土，可用手耙轻轻松表土。
    查苗补种是有一定时间限制的，各地必须立即行动起来查苗补种，保证全苗。在已播种未出苗的地区应提高警惕，作好补种准备；尚未播种地区，尤须注意整地、播种技术及防治害虫等工作，及时下种，争取全苗，为明年小麦增产打下基础。
