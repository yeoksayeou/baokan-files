Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 29th: "L'Humanité" published an article by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, entitled: "Double Efforts to Fight Against Agreements Leading to War and to Strive for the Unity of the Working Class."

　　Thorez first pointed out that in the weeks from Mendès-France's trip to the United States to the National Assembly's vote on the bill to ratify the London and Paris Agreements, the struggle between the forces of peace in France and the forces advocating the revival of German militarism became more acute. Thorez reminded that ratifying the Paris Accords would deepen the danger of war, revive German militarism, and reject joint cooperation to establish an effective European collective security system. Ratifying the Paris Accords is incompatible with any sincere desire to reunify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country, and a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany is in France's interest.

　　Thorez then pointed out that the struggle of the masses played a decisive role in defeating the "European Defence Community" and achieving successes at the Geneva Conference. He wrote: "The French people remember the lessons of history. They especially remember why the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed, and in a few days the French people will celebrate the tenth anniversary of this treaty. The French people know that, precisely because of geographical reasons, the agreement signed by the two peoples is forever needed to contain German militarism."

　　Thorez refuted the absurd claim that the supporters of the Franco-Soviet cooperation policy were trying to undermine the French Union, writing: "Who is undermining the French Union? Is it not the kind of people who are trying to return weapons to the enemy and foreign aggressors, in order to prepare, with their help, to invade allies, to invade the countries with whom we have treaties, who saved us twelve years ago and won the historic victory of Stalingrad?"

　　Thorez also wrote that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference to discuss European security issues "is precisely the conference that the French people hope to convene." He pointed out that even those who used to believe in Mendès-France, those who sympathized with him, have now opened their eyes and expressed unease. These people are voicing that the Prime Minister has gradually become unpopular, and his supporters expect something else from him. France has just gotten rid of the nightmare of the "European Defence Community," and it is not worth tasting the bitter medicine of rearming Germany in disguise.

　　Thorez continued: The French people once again feel the responsibility they have for the fate of the country. The masses have shown a strong will and participated in the movement. "Therefore, we can see that politicians are expressing opposition to the rearmament of Germany one after another. These people's remarks are not simply expressing their personal opinions, but primarily indicating that profound changes have taken place within the social classes and strata they represent."

　　Thorez called on French workers in the Socialist Party to oppose the Paris Accords together with German Social Democrats.

　　Thorez concluded: "Because Communists are true internationalists and genuine defenders of the equal rights of all countries, they defend French interests on all occasions. Based on this great principle, the activists of our Party will spare no effort in the coming difficult days to mobilize the masses of residents in all regions to repel the direct dangers looming over our country and demand that parliamentarians take the necessary actions. Communist activists know that the unity of the working class is of decisive significance for uniting all democratic and national forces, and for uniting people from all social strata who advocate immediately holding negotiations on European security and peace."

    多列士撰文分析重新武装西德的危险
    号召法国人民反对批准巴黎协定
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党总书记多列士的一篇文章，题目是：“加倍努力为反对导致战争的协定和争取工人阶级的团结而奋斗”。
    多列士首先指出，从孟戴斯—弗朗斯到美国去以后到国民议会表决关于批准伦敦和巴黎协定法案之前的几个星期中，法国的和平力量和主张复活德国军国主义的势力之间的斗争更加尖锐了。多列士提醒说：批准巴黎协定，就是加深战争的危险，复活德国军国主义和拒绝共同合作来建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系。批准巴黎协定是和把德国重新统一为一个和平民主国家的任何真诚愿望不相容的，而一个统一、和平、民主的德国是符合法国的利益的。
    多列士接着指出人民群众的斗争在击垮“欧洲防务集团”和在日内瓦会议上取得成绩方面起有决定性的作用。他写道：“法国人民记得历史的教训。他们特别记得为什么要签订法苏互助条约，再过几天法国人民将庆祝这个条约的十周年。法国人民知道，正是因为地理的关系，两国人民所签订的协定是永远需要的，以便制止德国军国主义”。
    多列士驳斥了那种诬蔑法苏合作政策的拥护者仿佛是要破坏法兰西联邦的荒谬说法，他写道：“是谁破坏法兰西联邦呢？难道不是这样的一种人吗？他们力图把武器交还给敌人和外国侵略者，好靠他们的帮助来准备侵略盟友、侵略同我们缔结条约的、在十二年前拯救我们的和获得斯大林格勒历史性胜利的国家。”
    多列士又写道：苏联建议召开的讨论欧洲安全问题的全欧会议“正是法国人民希望召开的会议。”他指出：甚至那些过去相信孟戴斯—弗朗斯的人、那些同情他的人，今天也睁开了眼睛，纷纷表示不安了。那些人士发出呼声说：总理已经渐渐不得人心了，他的支持者期望于他的是别的东西。法国刚刚摆脱了“欧洲防务集团”这个恶梦，又尝到了改头换面的重新武装德国这杯苦酒，这太不值得了。
    多列士继续写道：法国人民再一次感到自己对国家的命运负有的责任。群众表现出强大的意志，参加了运动。“因此，我们可以看到，政治家们一个接着一个地表示反对重新武装德国，这些人的言论不是简单地表现他们个人的意见，而首先是表示出他们所代表的那些社会阶级和阶层内部已经发生了深刻的变动。”
      多列士号召参加社会党的法国工人同德国社会民主党人一起反对巴黎协定。
    多列士最后写道：“因为共产党人是真正的国际主义者，是各国平等权利的真正捍卫者，他们在任何场合下都是保卫法国利益的。根据这一伟大的原则，我们党的积极分子在即将到来的艰苦时日中将不遗余力地动员各地居民群众来击退笼罩着我们国家的直接危险，要求议员们采取必要的行动。共产党的积极分子知道，工人阶级的团结对于团结所有的民主和民族力量、团结主张立即举行关于欧洲安全及和平的谈判的各种观点的各社会阶层人物，是具有决定性意义的。”
