Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society to Japan attended a welcome banquet hosted jointly by the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council on the evening of October 30th.

    The venue was in the hall of the International Kanko Hotel. A large Red Cross flag hung on the front of the hall, with the national flags of China and Japan on either side.

    Those present included Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Kazuyoshi Kasai, Vice President, Ikuo Oyama, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, Masaharu Hatanaka, Secretary-General, Wanzou Uchiyama, Vice President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Yoshitaro Hirano, and other representatives of the three Japanese organizations.

    Also present were Mozaburo Suzuki of the Left-wing Socialist Party, Genjiro Sugiyama and Mitsuru Kono of the Right-wing Socialist Party, Kikujiro Yamaguchi of the Liberal Party, Tokuji Tokonami of the Reform Party, Masanosuke Ikeda of the Japanese Liberal Party, Hisao Kuroda of the Labor Party, Goro Sudo and Kanichi Kawakami of the Japanese Communist Party, and other members of the Japanese Diet from various parties who had visited China, as well as Kogoro Uemura, Vice Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, Kumaichi Yamamoto, Vice Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Tohtaro Fujita, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Minoru Takano, Secretary-General, Ayako Ishigaki, Kaneko Seki, and Yoko Matsuoka, representatives of the cultural community, and Mingqiu Kang and Wenfang Gan, representatives of overseas Chinese in Japan, totaling about 300 people.

    Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, delivered a welcome speech at the meeting. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross Society for its great assistance in repatriating Japanese nationals residing in China. He said: I stated when I was in Beijing last year that I would definitely invite you to Japan. This wish has now been realized, which is truly gratifying.

    Next, Ikuo Oyama, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, delivered a welcome speech, saying: My heart is now filled with indescribable joy. Not only are we happy, but all the Japanese people are happy. This expresses the gratitude of the Japanese people to the Chinese people. The friendship shown by the Chinese government and people to the Japanese people, and the sincere attitude adopted in resolving various difficult issues, are greatly appreciated by the Japanese people. He pointed out: The Japanese people are now fervently demanding world peace and the independence of their country. This demand is growing stronger and stronger. We hope to enjoy independence and democracy in a peaceful world without atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs, and to be friendly with the people of all countries around the world. Therefore, we must unite with the people of Asian countries, especially with the people of New China. In this regard, many hopeful things have happened recently, especially the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru a few months ago, and the joint declaration recently announced by the Chinese and Soviet governments, which have had a profound impact on the Japanese people. He also said: At this time, the delegation has come from afar, fulfilling what we have long awaited and dreamed of. Your visit will undoubtedly further open the road for economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan.

    Wanzou Uchiyama, Vice President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, continued to deliver a welcome speech. He said: The relationship between China and Japan has inseparable flesh-and-blood ties for thousands of years. The feelings of the Japanese people towards China are like those of brothers. Unfortunately, Japan's past war of aggression committed an unforgivable crime. However, the Chinese people have separated the Japanese militarists from the Japanese people and have always extended a hand of friendship to the Japanese people. During the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of China, the Sino-Soviet joint declaration was issued, giving the Japanese people great joy and confidence. The Japanese people are determined to eliminate all obstacles and shake hands with the Chinese people, and the movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has begun.

    Head of Delegation Li Dequan rose amidst thunderous applause to deliver a speech. On behalf of all the members of the delegation, she expressed her heartfelt gratitude for the grand welcome from the three organizations. She said: The friendly exchanges between the peoples and public organizations of China and Japan are constantly deepening the understanding and friendship between the two peoples. In recent years, delegations from Japan representing a very broad range of sectors, such as peace, culture, women, youth, trade, trade unions, and members of the Diet, have successively visited China and introduced the situation of New China to the Japanese people. Today, the visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society is visiting Japan for the first time after the war, bringing the friendship of the Chinese people to Japan. All these visits and exchanges are intertwined with the emotions of the two peoples, and all these visits and exchanges are enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. Li Dequan especially mentioned the assistance of the three Japanese organizations in repatriating overseas Chinese residing in Japan, collecting the remains of Chinese martyrs who were killed by Japanese militarists and sending them back to China, and the Chinese Red Cross Society's assistance in repatriating Japanese nationals, and expressed her deep gratitude to the three Japanese organizations.

    Li Dequan said: Today, what countries need is peace and cooperation, not war and hostility. Friendly exchanges between the people and public organizations of various countries are conducive to understanding and cooperation between countries, especially friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, which are more conducive to the cause of peace in Asia. Therefore, the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation to Japan this time is a very meaningful event, both in enhancing the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and in safeguarding peace in the Far East and Asia.

    Li Dequan emphasized: The Chinese Red Cross Society and the Chinese people have always been very concerned about the Japanese people. We express our respect for the efforts made by the Japanese people in defending peace and opposing war. We would like to take this opportunity to meet with relevant Japanese people's organizations, have cordial conversations, and convey the friendship and concern of the Chinese people to the Japanese people; at the same time, we extend our condolences to the Japanese people who have suffered from war disasters and atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters.

    Li Dequan, after talking about the work of the Chinese Red Cross Society in assisting Japanese nationals residing in China and former Japanese soldiers who had been pardoned for various crimes to return to Japan, said: It is estimated that a batch of Japanese nationals will continue to return to their country by the end of this year or early next year, and we will continue to provide all possible assistance to Japanese nationals who are willing to return to their country in accordance with the "Communique on Negotiating Assistance for the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals." Our delegation has also brought a list of all Japanese war criminals remaining in China, most of whom will soon be leniently dealt with by our government. The Chinese Red Cross Society is willing to take care of and help them as much as possible in the spirit of humanitarianism. In addition, there is a group of Japanese nationals in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam who are willing to return to their country, and the Chinese Red Cross Society is also willing to assist them in returning to their country via Shanghai.

    Those who also delivered speeches at the banquet included Tamaki Uemura, President of the Japanese YWCA, Mozaburo Suzuki, Tohtaro Fujita, Gan Wenfang, etc. Kogoro Uemura, in his speech, especially expressed his desire to promote economic exchanges between Japan and China. He said, "Although the economic relations between Japan and China are currently in an unnatural state, I believe that this state should not continue for long, and it will surely become normal in the near future due to the efforts of most people. I believe that Ms. Li's visit to Japan this time will deepen mutual understanding between Japan and China, promote friendship between Japan and China, and advance economic exchanges."

    The banquet proceeded in a friendly and warm atmosphere throughout. Finally, it ended with shouts of slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples!"

    Japanese people who welcomed the delegation enthusiastically held lanterns and sang welcome songs around the venue and in front of the Imperial Hotel when the delegation returned to their residence, the Imperial Hotel, after the banquet, until late at night.

    日本红十字会、日中友好协会等团体
    欢宴我国红十字会访日代表团
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：中国红十字会访日代表团十月三十日晚出席了日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会三团体共同主办的欢迎宴会。
    会场设在国际观光饭店大厅。大厅正面挂着大红十字旗，两旁悬挂着中日两国国旗。
    到会的有日本红十字会会长岛津忠承、副会长葛西嘉资，日本和平联络会代表大山郁夫，事务局长畑中政春，日中友好协会副会长内山完造、平野义太郎等日本三团体的代表。
    到会的还有左派社会党铃木茂三郎，右派社会党杉山元治郎、河野密，自由党山口喜久一郎，改进党床次德二，日本自由党池田正之辅，劳动党黑田寿男，日本共产党须藤五郎、川上贯一等曾到中国访问的日本各党派国会议员，以及经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎，日本国际贸易促进协会副会长山本熊一，日本工会总评议会主席藤田藤太郎、事务局长高野实，文化界代表石垣绫子、关鉴子、松冈洋子，旅日华侨代表康鸣球、甘文芳等共约三百多人。
    日本红十字会会长岛津忠承在会上致欢迎辞。他对中国红十字会大力协助留华日本侨民回国，表示衷心的谢意。他说：我去年在北京的时候就表示过，一定要邀请诸位到日本来一趟。这个愿望现在已经实现了，这实在是令人高兴的事情。
    接着，日本和平联络会代表大山郁夫致欢迎辞说：现在我的心里充满着不可言喻的欢喜，不但我们欢喜，全日本人民都在欢喜。这表示着日本国民对中国人民的感谢。中国政府和人民向日本国民表示的友谊，以及解决各种困难问题时所采取的诚恳的态度，是日本国民十分感激的。他指出：日本国民现在热烈要求着世界和平和祖国的独立。这个要求是越来越强烈了。我们希望在没有原子弹、氢弹的和平世界里，享受独立民主，同全世界各国人民友好。因此，我们必须同亚洲各国人民团结一起，尤其是同新中国的人民团结起来。在这方面，最近接连地发生了许多使我们满怀希望的事情，尤其是在几个月前，周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理发表的联合声明和最近中苏两国政府公布的联合宣言，给日本国民以很深刻的影响。他又说：正在这个时候，代表团远路而来，使我们等候和梦想已久的事情实现了。你们的访问无疑将更进一步开辟中日两国经济和文化交流的道路。
    日中友好协会副会长内山完造继起致欢迎辞。他说：中国和日本的关系是有着几千年分不开的血肉的联系。日本国民和中国的感情就像兄弟一样。不幸过去日本的侵略战争犯了不可饶恕的罪过。但是，中国人民把日本军阀和日本国民分开看待，一直向日本国民伸着友谊的手。在欢庆中国建国五周年的时候，又发表了中苏联合宣言，给予日本国民莫大的欢欣和信心。日本国民决心排除一切阻碍，和中国人民握手，恢复中日邦交的运动已在开展。
    李德全团长在雷动的掌声中起立致辞。她代表代表团全体人员对三团体的盛大欢迎表示衷心的感谢。她说：中日两国人民和公众团体的友好往来正在不断地加深着两国人民间的了解和友谊。几年来，日本的和平、文化、妇女、青年、贸易、工会和国会议员等代表着极其广泛阶层的代表团先后访问了中国，并把新中国的情况介绍给日本人民。今天中国红十字会访日代表团又在战后第一次访问日本，把中国人民的友谊带到了日本。所有这些访问往来都交织着两国人民的情感，所有这些往来访问都增进着中日两国人民的友谊。李德全特别提到日本三团体协助旅日华侨回国、收殓被日本军国主义者所杀害的中国烈士的遗骨并送回中国以及中国红十字会协助日侨回国的这些事实，并对日本三团体致以深厚的谢意。
    李德全说：今天，各国间所需要的是和平和合作而不是战争和敌视。各国人民和公众团体的友好往来是有利于各国的了解和合作的，特别是中日两国人民间的友好往来，更是有利于亚洲的和平事业。因此，这次中国红十字会代表团的访问日本，无论在增强中日两国人民的友好关系上，或在保卫远东和亚洲的和平上，都是一件很有意义的事情。
    李德全强调说：中国红十字会和中国人民在一起，一向对日本人民十分关怀。对日本人民在保卫和平、反对战争这方面所作的努力表示敬意。我们愿意借此机会同日本各有关人民团体见面，亲切地畅谈，并传达中国人民对日本人民的友谊和关怀；同时向遭到战争灾害、遭受原子弹、氢弹灾害的日本人民致以慰问。
    李德全在谈到中国红十字会协助在中国居住的日本侨民和蒙受宽赦的犯有各种罪行的前日本军人回到日本的工作以后说：估计今年年末或明年初，将有一批日侨继续回国，我们仍会按照“关于商洽协助日侨回国问题的公报”，继续给予愿意回国的日侨以一切可能的协助。我们代表团这次还带来了留在中国的全部日本战犯名单，其中大部分战犯将很快地得到我国政府的宽大处理。中国红十字会愿意本着人道主义精神尽可能地对他们予以照顾和帮助。此外，越南民主共和国境内还有一批日本侨民愿意回国，中国红十字会也愿意协助他们经由上海回国。
    在宴会上致辞的还有日本基督教女青年会会长植村环，铃木茂三郎，藤田藤太郎，甘文芳等。植村甲午郎在致辞时特别表示对于开展日中两国经济交流的愿望。他说：“现在日中两国的经济关系虽处于不自然的状态，但是我认为这种状态不应长久继续，在不久的将来一定会由于大多数人们的努力正常起来。我相信，由于李会长这回访日，一定会加深日中两国的相互了解，促进日中两国间的友好，并使经济交流向前发展。”
    宴会始终在友好和热烈的气氛中进行，最后在高呼“中日两国人民友好万岁！”等口号后结束。
    欢迎代表团的日本群众，在代表团于宴会结束后回住所帝国饭店时，热情地在会场四周和帝国饭店门前手提灯笼高唱欢迎之歌，直至深夜。
