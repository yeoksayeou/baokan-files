Farmers of various ethnic groups in Simao Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, known as the "Granary of Southern Yunnan," are abundant in grain production. The farmers of various ethnic groups in the thirteen original agricultural production cooperatives and two hundred and one newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the six counties of Simao Prefecture, as well as a large number of mutual aid teams, have actively paid public grain after the bumper harvest and have set off a wave of selling surplus grain. At present, according to preliminary statistics, the amount of grain stored in the warehouses of various counties has exceeded two million jin. The Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xintang Township, Pu'er County, increased production by 37% this year, with an average yield of 646 jin per mu. The income of the cooperative members has generally increased, and every household is selling surplus grain. The cooperative sold more than 55,800 jin of surplus grain to the state, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year. Under the impetus of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative, every household in the township held family meetings to carefully calculate and sell more surplus grain. The township sold more than 420,000 jin of surplus grain. The newly established Jiankang Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mojiang County also sold more than 39,000 jin of surplus grain. The Wei Zhenghua Mutual Aid Team in Keli Township, Jinggu County, has a total of sixteen households. Before liberation, only one family barely had enough to eat. This year, the entire team increased production by 31%, fifteen families had enough to eat, and fourteen families sold surplus grain. The whole team sold more than 16,000 jin of surplus grain.

In order to prevent the state from suffering losses, the vast number of farmers actively dried and winnowed the grain to hand over and sell good grain. Members of the Liaoyuan and other agricultural production cooperatives in Pu'er County first ground and ate the sprouted grain, leaving good grain to be handed over to the state. Farmers in Sanjia Village Township, Simao County, guaranteed that the public grain they delivered would be "dry, clean, and full," and guaranteed that "bad grain would not leave the village."

After selling the surplus grain, the farmers actively invested the money they earned from selling grain into production, deposited it in state-owned banks or credit cooperatives, and used it to increase the shares of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. In addition to using part of the money earned from selling grain to buy cattle and make farm tools, the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pu'er County deposited more than 30 million yuan in the bank, accounting for more than 38% of the total proceeds from selling grain. The Pingyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanjia Village Township, Simao County, increased its shares in the supply and marketing cooperative by 1.51 million yuan and deposited 12.9 million yuan in the bank.

Farmers of various ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna are harvesting rice in full swing, preparing to sell a large amount of surplus grain to the state. Dai and Hani farmers in Menghai, Mengzhe, Menghun, Mandu, Yiwu and other places in Xishuangbanna have already sold more than 240,000 jin of soybeans to the state.

    思茅专区和西双版纳各族农民
    踊跃缴纳公粮出卖余粮
    云南省思茅专区各县和西双版纳傣族自治区盛产粮食，西双版纳素有“滇南谷仓”之称。思茅专区内地六个县的十三个原有的农业生产合作社、二百零一个新建的农业生产合作社，以及大批互助组中的各族农民，在丰收以后积极缴纳公粮，并且掀起了出卖余粮的热潮。目前，各县入仓粮食，据初步统计已经有二百多万斤。普洱县新塘乡燎原农业生产合作社今年增产三成七，每亩平均产量达六百四十六斤。社员收入普遍增加，家家户户都出卖余粮。全社卖给国家的余粮有五万五千八百多斤，比去年增加一倍半。在燎原农业生产合作社的带动下，全乡家家开家庭会，精打细算多卖余粮。全乡卖出的余粮有四十二万多斤。墨江县新建的健康第二农业生产合作社也卖出余粮三万九千多斤。景谷县课里乡魏正华互助组一共有十六户，解放前只有一家勉强够吃，今年全组增产三成一，有十五家够吃，十四家卖了余粮。全组卖出的余粮有一万六千多斤。
    广大农民为了使国家不受损失，积极把粮食晒干扬净，缴售好粮。普洱县燎原等农业生产合作社的社员们把出芽谷先碾着吃了，留下好谷子缴给国家。思茅县三家村乡农民保证缴的公粮要“一干、二净、三饱满”，保证“坏粮不出村”。
    农民们卖出余粮后，积极把卖粮得到的钱投入生产，存入国家银行或信用合作社，并用来增加供销合作社和信用合作社的股金。普洱县燎原农业生产合作社除了用一部分卖粮得到的钱买耕牛、制农具以外，存入银行三千多万元，占卖粮所得款项总数的百分之三十八以上。思茅县三家村乡平原农业生产合作社在供销合作社增加股金一百五十一万元，存入银行一千二百九十万元。
    西双版纳各族农民正在紧张收割稻谷，准备把大批余粮卖给国家。版纳孟海、孟遮、孟混、曼埻、易武等地傣族、哈尼族农民，已经卖给国家二十四万多斤黄豆。
