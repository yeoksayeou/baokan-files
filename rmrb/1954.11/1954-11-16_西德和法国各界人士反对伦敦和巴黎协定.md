Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 15th: According to TASS, many prominent figures in West Germany have recently expressed their opposition to the Paris Agreements for arming West Germany, and have called for a four-power conference to negotiate a solution to the German question.

    Dr. Heinemann, Chairman of the All-German People's Party and former Minister of the Interior of the Bonn government, said at the All-German People's Party Congress held in West Berlin that arming West Germany would make the reunification of Germany impossible, and that the only realistic way to restore German unity is through consultation.

    Kuhn, a member of the Bonn Bundestag and a Social Democrat, said at a voters' meeting in Cologne-Buchforst: "A four-power conference is the only opportunity to resolve the German question peacefully."

    Rademacher, a member of the Bonn Bundestag from the Free Democratic Party, advocated consultation between the major powers on the German question. He once said that the time has come to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the issue of unifying East and West Germany.

    Arnold, a former member of the Bundestag from the Center Party, pointed out the dangers of the London and Paris Agreements to Germany. She advocated that representatives from East and West Germany hold all-German talks to prepare for and facilitate the holding of a four-power conference.

  　Mrs. Karl-Oldorf-Oheim, a former member of parliament, said: "The Bundestag and the Federal Government can only meet the demands of the vast majority of the German people for peace, unity and security by urging the three Western powers to agree to convene a four-power conference as soon as possible. Consultation with representatives of the Grotewohl government will only benefit the four-power conference."

    Picard, a female writer from Stuttgart, said that the task of peace-loving people in West Germany is: "To fight to the end against re-militarization, and to persevere in striving to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the two social systems."

    Kaufmann, editor-in-chief of the Dortmund "West German Daily," advocated
  “seriously considering” the Soviet Union’s proposals, believing that studying the Soviet proposals is "the current requirement."

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 14th: According to TASS, former French Prime Minister Paul Boncour published a statement in the weekly "International Forum" opposing the London and Paris Agreements.

    In his statement, Paul Boncour stated that he opposed the London and Paris Agreements just as he had opposed the "European Defense Community" in the past, because these agreements "mean arming Germany, and are nothing more than a facade for such arming."

    The statement said: The conditions for arming Germany stipulated in the Paris Agreements are more dangerous than those stipulated in the "European Defense Community."

    The statement emphasized that Western countries must hold talks with the Soviet Union. The statement said: "I believe this is appropriate. I also believe that such talks are possible on the basis of the coexistence of the two systems."

    西德和法国各界人士反对伦敦和巴黎协定
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十三日讯：西德许多知名人士在最近表示反对武装西德的巴黎协定，要求举行四国会议协商解决德国问题。
    全德人民党主席、前波恩政府内政部长海涅曼博士在西柏林举行的全德人民党党员大会上说，武装西德会使恢复德国统一成为不可能，恢复德国统一的唯一现实的办法是协商。
    波恩联邦议院议员、社会民主党人库恩在科隆—布赫福斯特的选民大会上说：“四国会议是以和平办法来解决德国问题的唯一机会。”
    波恩联邦议院自由民主党议员拉戴马赫主张大国就德国问题进行协商，他曾说，就统一东德和西德的问题和苏联进行谈判的时机已经到来了。
    联邦议院前议员、中央党的阿诺德指出伦敦和巴黎协定对德国的危险，她主张东西德派代表举行全德谈判，以筹备和促成举行四国会议。
  　前国会议员卡尔道夫—欧亥姆夫人说：“联邦议院和联邦政府只有敦促三个西方国家同意迅速召开四国会议，才能满足绝大多数德国人民对和平、统一和安全的要求。和格罗提渥政府的代表协商只会对四国会议有益。”
    斯图加特的女作家比卡德说：西德爱好和平的人们的任务是：“为反对重新军国主义化而奋斗到底，为努力保证两种社会制度的和平共处而坚持到底。”
    多特蒙德“西德日报”的总编辑考夫曼主张
  “认真地对待”苏联的建议，他认为研究苏联的建议是“当前的要求”。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十四日讯：法国前总理保罗—邦古在“国际论坛”周刊上发表声明，反对伦敦和巴黎协定。
    保罗—邦古在声明中表示他像过去反对“欧洲防务集团”那样地反对伦敦和巴黎协定，因为这些协定“意味着武装德国，而且只不过是这种武装的幌子。”
    声明说：巴黎协定所规定的武装德国的条件比“欧洲防务集团”所规定的更加危险。
    声明着重指出西方国家必须同苏联举行会谈。声明说：“我相信这是适当的。我也相信，在两种制度共处的基础上，这种会谈是可能的。”
