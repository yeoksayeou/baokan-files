Xinhua News Agency, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the morning of November 8 to continue discussions on international cooperation in the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

At the beginning of the meeting, US Representative Lodge, on behalf of the delegations of seven countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Union of South Africa), put forward a proposal suggesting that once the International Atomic Energy Agency is established, it should "negotiate an agreement in an appropriate form with the United Nations, similar to the agreements of specialized agencies." The proposal also stipulates that an international technical conference should be convened under the auspices of the United Nations no later than August 1955 to seek ways to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

French Representative Jules Moch then spoke, supporting the US proposal which formed the basis of the above proposal. He acknowledged that full cooperation in the peaceful application of atomic energy can only be achieved after the danger of nuclear war is eliminated, but he said that this cooperation should be established and developed without waiting for this danger to be eliminated. The representatives of Belgium and the Netherlands also supported the above proposal.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky then spoke. Vyshinsky said that the speeches by the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, especially the US representative, could not give a sufficiently clear idea of the plans for international cooperation and international institutions organized for the peaceful application of atomic energy, and some issues needed to be clarified.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the above-mentioned plan differs greatly from the rumored draft measures and the ambitious goals proposed by Eisenhower in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in December 1953. He asked the US representative to explain why the plan currently proposed by the United States has reduced the scale and form of international cooperation in the peaceful application of atomic energy, especially in terms of technical and economic assistance to backward countries, compared with previous proposals.

Vyshinsky asked to know why the current proposal reduces the responsibility of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council? According to the current proposal of the United States and other countries, the International Atomic Energy Agency will become a specialized agency similar to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The US memorandum of March 19 stated definitively that the agency should report to the General Assembly and the Security Council.

Vyshinsky said that Lodge's speech stated that the agency would only carry out part of its work at the beginning, that is, only the work that is suitable for it. Vyshinsky asked to know: what is the exact meaning of these words, which specific parts of the work are to be carried out by this international agency at the beginning, and what does the work that is most suitable for it refer to.

Vyshinsky continued that the Soviet delegation would also like to know whether any measures are planned under this plan to complete such an important task as reducing the "potential destructiveness of the world's atomic stockpile" (also announced by Eisenhower in his speech on December 8 last year)? If such measures are planned, in what way?

Vyshinsky also pointed out that US Representative Lodge and certain other representatives attempted to describe the Soviet Union's attitude on the issue of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy as "basically negative," as a refusal to negotiate on this issue, which is unfounded. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet government has never wanted to make the US first agreeing to the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons or abandon the use of these weapons a condition for participating in the negotiations proposed by the US. The Soviet government only pointed out in its reply to the US government that it would be appropriate to discuss the issue of concluding a solemn and unconditional guarantee not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or any other weapons of mass destruction during the negotiation process. Vyshinsky pointed out that the argument that certain representatives are using this desire expressed by the Soviet government as "evidence" that the Soviet Union refuses or opposes negotiations on the issue of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy has already fallen flat.

The Soviet representative reserves the right to express opinions on the substance of the issues under discussion and on the proposals put forward by this group of countries later.

    联大政委会继续讨论原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题
    维辛斯基发言评论美英等七国提案的内容
   【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十一月八日上午举行会议，继续讨论在发展原子能的和平用途方面的国际合作问题。
    会议开始时，美国代表洛奇以七国代表团（澳大利亚、比利时、加拿大、英国、美国、法国和南非联邦）的名义提出一个提案，建议国际原子能机构一旦成立以后就“同联合国谈判一项适当形式的协议，相仿于专门机构的协议”。这个提案还规定不迟于一九五五年八月在联合国主持下召开一次国际技术会议，以寻求发展原子能的和平用途的办法。
    法国代表儒勒·莫克接着发言。他支持构成上述提案的基础的美国建议。他承认，只有在核子战争的危险消除以后，才能充分做到在和平应用原子能方面进行合作，但是他又说，应当不等这种危险消除就建立和发展这种合作。比利时和荷兰的代表也支持上述提案。
    苏联代表维辛斯基接着发言。维辛斯基说，美、英、法和其他国家的代表、特别是美国代表的发言，不能使人对于为了和平应用原子能而组织的国际合作和国际机构的计划有足够清楚的观念，有些问题需要得到澄清。
    维辛斯基指出，上述计划同早先传闻中的措施方案和艾森豪威尔一九五三年十二月向联合国大会发表演说时所提出的规模巨大的目标，有很大的不同。他要求美国代表解释，为什么美国目前提出的计划，和以前的建议比较起来，缩小了在和平应用原子能方面的国际合作的规模和形式，特别是在对落后国家的技术的和经济的援助方面。
    维辛斯基要求知道，为什么目前的建议中减少了国际原子能机构对联合国大会和安全理事会所负有的责任？根据美国等国目前的提案，国际原子能机构将成为一个类似联合国教育、科学及文化组织的专门机构。而在美国三月十九日的备忘录中曾肯定地说，这个机构应该向大会和安全理事会提出报告。
    维辛斯基说，洛奇的发言中说这个机构一开始的时候将只进行它的工作的一部分，就是只进行适合于它的那种工作。维辛斯基要求知道：这些话的确切意义是什么，这项工作的哪些具体部分是要这个国际机构一开始时进行的，最适合于它的工作指的是什么。
    维辛斯基接着说，苏联代表团还愿意知道，根据这个计划是否打算采取任何措施，来完成像减少“世界原子储藏的潜在毁灭力”（也是艾森豪威尔在去年十二月八日的演说中宣布过的）这样重要的任务？如果打算采取这种措施的话，又用什么方式？
    维辛斯基还指出，美国代表洛奇和某些其他代表企图把苏联在和平使用原子能方面的国际合作的问题上的态度说成“基本上是否定的”，说成是拒绝在这个问题上谈判，这是没有根据的。维辛斯基说，苏联政府从来没有想要把美国先同意苏联的禁止原子武器或者放弃使用这些武器的建议，作为参加美国所建议的谈判的条件。苏联政府只是在答复美国政府的文件中指出，在谈判过程中，讨论一下缔结一个庄严地、无条件地保证不使用原子武器、氢武器或任何其他大规模毁灭性武器的协定的问题，是适当的。维辛斯基指出：某些代表利用苏联政府所表示的这种愿望作为苏联拒绝，或是反对在原子能的和平用途方面的国际合作问题上进行谈判的“证据”，这种论点已经破产。
    苏联代表保留以后就讨论中问题的实质和就这一批国家所提出的提案发表意见的权利。
