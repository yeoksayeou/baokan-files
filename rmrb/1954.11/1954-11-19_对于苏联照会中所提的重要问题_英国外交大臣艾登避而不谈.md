Xinhua News Agency, November 18th dispatch: TASS London, November 17th dispatch: Reuters reports: British Foreign Secretary Eden responded to a question from Opposition Leader Attlee regarding whether the government would issue a statement on the Soviet Union's new proposal to convene an all-European security conference.

Eden replied that the purpose of the Soviet note was to oppose the ratification of the Paris Accords for the rearmament of West Germany.

Eden attempted to make it seem as though the Soviet note contained nothing new. He said: "As the House is aware, the British government's view is that our primary task is to ratify these agreements and put them into effect. We must not allow our attention to be diverted."

Eden then said that he had not discussed the government's views. He said, "I cannot discuss it, but I think it is right to inform the House of our initial reaction."

In this way, Eden avoided a serious analysis of the Soviet note. In particular, he quietly glossed over the part of the note that addressed the consequences of the imminent ratification of the agreements for the rearmament of West Germany. In fact, he repeated the kind of propaganda rhetoric that the Western countries had been using about the Soviet note.
Xinhua News Agency, November 17th dispatch: TASS London, November 16th dispatch: The British bourgeois newspapers all published summaries of the Soviet government's note proposing the convening of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system; only "The Times" published the full text of the note. These newspapers avoided mentioning the part of the Soviet note that stated that if the plans for reviving German militarism formulated at the London and Paris conferences were implemented, the peace-loving people of European countries would be forced to take new measures to ensure their security.

Diplomatic observers and news agencies commented on the Soviet government's note with considerable reservations. However, all observers unanimously pointed out that the Soviet government's latest peace proposal would apparently be rejected by Western countries because the conference proposed by the Soviet Union was in conflict with the London and Paris agreements, as well as with the statements by Western politicians refusing to hold any talks before ratifying these agreements.

The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" said: This note "is clearer than previous notes in aiming to prevent the arming of West Germany." "The Observer" said: Western countries and the Soviet Union have different views on security issues: the West insists on establishing military alliances, while the Communists advocate collective security.

Reuters commentator Stanley Pridell said: London diplomatic circles speculate that the Soviet Union may convene a European security conference in November, even if only countries of the Communist bloc participate. This conference will issue a new call against the arming of West Germany, and Western governments will condemn such a conference, but "this conference may attract the attention of the public."

An editorial in the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" said: The Soviet note also asks neutral countries to participate in the European conference. The Soviet note contains more than just obstructing the ratification of the Paris Treaty and undermining the North Atlantic Alliance. The Soviet government may really want to conclude a collective security treaty including all European countries.

    对于苏联照会中所提的重要问题
    英国外交大臣艾登避而不谈
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社伦敦十七日讯：路透社报道：英国外交大臣艾登回答了反对党领袖艾德礼所问政府是否要就苏联要求召开全欧安全会议的新建议发表声明的问题。
    艾登回答说，苏联照会的目的是在反对批准重新武装西德的巴黎协定。
    艾登企图把事情说得好像苏联照会没有什么新的内容。他说：“如下院所知，英国政府的意见是：我们的首要任务就是批准这些协定并把它们付诸实施。我们决不能让我们的注意力被转移。”
    艾登又说，他没有谈政府的意见。他说，“我不能谈它，但是我认为把我们初步的反应告诉下院是对的。”
    这样，艾登就避过了对苏联照会的认真分析。特别是，他悄悄地略过了照会中谈到迫在眼前的批准重新武装西德的协定一事所包含的后果的那一部分。事实上，他重复了西方国家就苏联照会所进行的那种宣传论调。
      【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十六日讯：英国资产阶级报刊都是摘要登载了苏联政府建议召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的照会，只有“泰晤士报”刊载了照会全文。这些报纸避而不提苏联照会中的这一部分：如果实施伦敦会议和巴黎会议制订的复活德国军国主义的计划，爱好和平的欧洲各国人民就会迫不得已而采取保障安全的新措施。
    外交观察家和通讯社都以相当保留的态度评论苏联政府的照会。可是所有观察家都一致指出：苏联政府最近这次和平建议显然会被西方国家拒绝，因为苏联所建议的会议同伦敦协定和巴黎协定互相抵触，同时也同西方政治家关于拒绝在批准这些协定之前举行任何会谈的声明互相抵触。
      “泰晤士报”的外交记者说：这个照会“比以前的照会更加清楚是为了制止武装西德”。“观察家报”说：西方国家和苏联对安全问题的看法不同：西方坚持建立军事联盟，而共产党主张集体安全。
    路透社评论员斯坦莱·普里德尔说：伦敦外交界人士推测，苏联可能在十一月召开欧洲安全问题会议，即使只有共产主义集团国家参加。这个会议将发出反对武装西德的新的号召，西方国家政府会谴责这样的会议，但是“这个会议可能引起社会人士的注意”。
    “每日电讯与晨邮报”的社论说：苏联的照会还要求中立的国家参加欧洲会议。苏联的照会比要阻挠巴黎条约的批准和搞垮北大西洋联盟还包含着更多的东西。苏联政府也许真的想缔结一个包括一切欧洲国家的集体安全条约。
