Xinhua News Agency, London, November 2nd: A British Conference for the Defense of International Security was held in London on October 31st. The conference was attended by 633 delegates from 339 organizations. The organizations that sent representatives to the conference included: local peace committees, the National Women's Assembly, more than 130 trade union organizations, some local organizations of the Labour Party, many student organizations, cooperative organizations, and other organizations.

    Gordon Schaffer served as chairman of the conference. In his opening remarks, he pointed out that this conference was "the broadest and most representative" gathering of peace advocates in the history of the British peace movement. He said that the purpose of this meeting was not only to strive against policies leading to war, but also to determine to implement policies that can guarantee peace.

    Schaffer pointed out that the principles of good neighborliness and peaceful coexistence are the guarantee of peace and security. To guarantee peace in Europe, it is necessary to smash the American plan to arm West Germany, establish a collective security system, and strive for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament.

    Elton, Chairman of the British Committee for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question, then spoke. He severely criticized the London Agreements and Paris Agreements on arming West Germany. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal in its October 23rd note opened the way for resolving the German question and establishing peace in Europe.

    The famous British atomic scientist, Burhop, emphasized in his speech that the hope of people all over the world for preventing atomic war is growing stronger day by day. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's attitude in the United Nations has made the possibility of reaching an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament greater than ever before.

    The speakers who followed included Municipal Councillor Dixon, Taylor, a representative of workers from the "Hadfields" machine factory (Sheffield), the famous British female social activist Davis, and Firemen's Union Chairman Burns. They all unanimously condemned the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party and the British Trades Union Congress for implementing policies that violate the interests of the British people and support the arming of West Germany.

    The conference passed a number of decisions on the afternoon of October 31st to strengthen the British struggle for peace.

    The resolution on the German question calls on all peace advocates to demand that their parliamentarians oppose the London Agreements on arming West Germany and advocate that the four powers immediately resume negotiations on the German question to ensure that the future Germany is a peaceful country. The memorandum attached to this resolution advocates rejecting the London Agreements and resuming negotiations on the German question. The memorandum says: "It will be too late if the four-power negotiations are delayed until irreversible measures to rearm Germany have already been taken."

    The conference also unanimously passed a declaration on maintaining peace, which stated: Only through joint efforts to reach agreements and cooperation can the problems that divide the world and threaten mankind with war be resolved. Only through the joint action of all countries in the world can the following issues be resolved: prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament; German and European security; a thorough solution to the Korean issue; giving China its rightful place in the United Nations; Asian security; giving the people of colonial and dependent countries fairness and independence in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter; eliminating obstacles to cultural exchange and trade between countries.

    The declaration said: "The peaceful coexistence of all countries requires mutual respect for the rights of all countries in accordance with the standards of action of the Five Principles declared by Prime Ministers Nehru and Zhou Enlai; peaceful coexistence requires everyone to jointly guarantee friendship and mutual understanding, so that all countries receive the same degree of security."

    The declaration said: "We welcome the call of the World Peace Council to launch a new and broad movement to convene a congress of representatives of peace forces from all countries in 1955."

    William Wainwright, Secretary of the British Peace Committee, said in summarizing the achievements of the conference that the conference was a major event in the British struggle to defend peace, and he called on everyone to actively strive to implement the decisions of the conference.

    通过关于德国问题的决议和维护和平宣言
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国保卫国际安全大会十月三十一日在伦敦举行。参加大会的有三百三十九个组织的六百三十三个代表。派代表参加大会的组织有：各地的和平委员会，全国妇女大会，一百三十多个工会组织，工党的一些地方组织，许多学生组织，合作社组织和其他组织。
    戈登·夏菲尔担任大会主席。他在会议开幕时指出：这次大会是英国和平运动历史上“最广泛的、最富有代表性的”一次和平拥护者代表大会。他说：这次会议的目的不仅是要努力反对导致战争的政策方针，而且还决心争取执行能够保障和平的政策。
    夏菲尔指出：睦邻关系和和平共处的原则，是和平和安全的保障。要保障欧洲和平，就必须粉碎武装西德的美国计划，建立集体安全体系，争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备。
    英国和平解决德国问题委员会主席埃尔顿接着讲话。他严厉地抨击了关于武装西德的伦敦协定和巴黎协定。他指出：苏联十月二十三日照会的建议，打开了解决德国问题和建立欧洲和平的道路。
    著名的英国原子科学家柏贺浦在发言中强调说：世界各国人民对防止原子战争的希望一天天加强了。他指出：苏联在联合国的态度，使得就禁止原子武器和裁减军备达成协议的可能比以前任何时候更大了。
    接着发言的有市政委员会委员狄克逊，“夏德罗”机器制造厂（设菲尔德）工人代表泰洛、著名的英国女社会活动家戴维斯、救火员工会主席伯恩斯等人。他们都一致谴责工党和英国职工大会右翼领导执行违反英国人民利益、支持武装西德的政策。
    大会在十月三十一日下午通过了若干加强英国争取和平的斗争的决定。
    关于德国问题的决议号召所有的和平拥护者要求自己的议员反对关于武装西德的伦敦协定，主张四国立即恢复德国问题的谈判，以保证未来的德国是一个和平的国家。附在这个决议中的备忘录主张否决伦敦协定，并恢复关于德国问题的谈判。备忘录说：“如果把四国谈判拖延到已经采取了重新武装德国的不可挽回的措施以后，那就晚了。”
    大会还一致通过了关于维护和平问题的宣言，宣言说：只有共同努力来取得协议和合作，才能解决那些使世界分裂，使人类遭到战争威胁的问题。只有世界各国联合行动起来，才能解决下列一切问题：禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁军；德国和欧洲安全；彻底解决朝鲜问题；给中国在联合国中应有的位置；亚洲安全；依照联合国宪章规定给殖民地和附属国人民以公平和独立；消除各国之间进行文化交流和贸易的障碍。
    宣言说：“各国的和平共处要求根据尼赫鲁和周恩来两位总理所宣布的五项原则的行动标准互相尊重各国的权利；和平共处要求大家共同来保障友谊，互相谅解，使各国得到同样程度的安全。”
    宣言说：“我们欢迎世界和平理事会的号召：展开一个新的广泛的运动，在一九五五年召开各国和平力量代表大会。”
    英国和平委员会书记威廉·温莱特在总结大会成绩时说：大会是英国保卫和平斗争中的一个重大事件，他号召大家积极争取实现大会的决定。
