Xinhua News Agency, Kyoto, November 8th: A "Kyoto Prefectural People's Rally to Welcome the Chinese Red Cross" was held yesterday afternoon with 15,000 people attending.

	The venue was the music hall in Maruyama Park. A huge banner reading "Build a Bridge of Peace Between Tokyo and Beijing" hung on the stage, with the national flags of China and Japan below it. Various flags of labor unions, schools, and Sino-Japanese friendship groups fluttered in the audience. Representatives from hundreds of organizations attended the welcome rally, including the Kyoto Local Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Kyoto Branch of the Japan Farmers' Association, the All-Kyoto Federation of Commerce and Industry Associations, Ritsumeikan University, Higashi Honganji Temple, the YMCA, the Kyoto Regional Women's Federation, the Repatriated Japanese Club, the Cultural Figures Roundtable, Korean residents, and Kyoto film workers, as well as overseas Chinese organizations. At 2:10 PM, as the delegation entered the venue, people raised and waved thousands of Chinese and Japanese national flags towards the stage, and flocks of peace doves flew from the venue into the blue sky, filling the entire venue with a warm and friendly atmosphere.

	After the rally began, Suekawa Hiroshi, Chairman of the Executive Committee for Welcoming the Chinese Red Cross, delivered a welcome speech, saying that China and Japan have had very close relations in culture, economy, and politics since ancient times, especially Kyoto, which has had the most far-reaching cultural exchanges with China since the Heian period, and today more exchanges are needed. He said that China's handling of the issue of Japanese expatriates returning home and the issue of war criminals is full of friendly and magnanimous spirit, and the people of Japan are sincerely grateful. He emphasized that although diplomatic relations between China and Japan are still in a state of non-restoration, the Japanese people, like the Chinese people, sincerely hope for peace and friendship. Therefore, we absolutely cannot tolerate the policy of Asians fighting Asians. He emphasized that the wish of Asians is for Asians to firmly shake hands with each other. Today, in the name of all those participating in the welcome rally, we pledge to bravely work hard for world peace and for the happiness of mankind.

	Suekawa Hiroshi's speech aroused cheers from the entire audience. Li Dequan, the head of the delegation, said in her speech that Sino-Japanese friendship is the common aspiration of the people of China and Japan. This time, as folk envoys, we have brought the Chinese people's sincere friendly wishes and firm determination to the Japanese people. She said that the Chinese people are willing to take steps to establish normal relations with Japan based on the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and advocate developing extensive trade relations and close cultural ties in accordance with mutually beneficial conditions. She pointed out that the Chinese people are deeply aware that only Sino-Japanese friendship can better guarantee peace in the East and the world. We hope that Japan will become a peaceful, independent, democratic, and free country, coexist peacefully with China in the East, exchange what each other has, and prosper together. She finally said that the Chinese people are determined to overcome all difficulties so that normal relations between China and Japan can be established. We believe that Japanese friends also have full confidence in this.

	Li Dequan's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause. After her speech, the conference then read out the list of gifts presented by more than seventy organizations.

	The conference ended at 3:00 PM. Japanese friends sang the songs "Song of Peace" and "Tokyo-Beijing" to bid farewell to the delegation until the delegation left the venue.
Xinhua News Agency, Kyoto, November 8th: The Chinese Red Cross delegation visited Kyoto's famous historical sites on the 7th - Heian Shrine, Nishijin Textile Center, Katsura Imperial Villa, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Higashi Honganji Temple and Nishi Honganji Temple.
