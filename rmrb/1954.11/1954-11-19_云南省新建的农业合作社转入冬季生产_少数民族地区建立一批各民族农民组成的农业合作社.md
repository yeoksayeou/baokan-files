    The more than 4,900 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Yunnan Province have begun to shift to winter production in a planned and orderly manner.

    Since the establishment of these new cooperatives, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions to consolidate and improve them, and Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the new cooperatives. In Yuxi, Qujing, Chuxiong, Mengzi and other regions, as well as in most counties and townships such as Chenggong and Luxi, the method of older cooperatives leading newer ones and convening meetings of cooperative directors and members has been used to guide each cooperative in formulating practical and feasible production plans in accordance with national plans. They have also helped the new cooperatives gradually establish some management systems and improve labor organization. The Xiong Zuneng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qujing County has formulated a more detailed work point system and implemented a small-scale contracting system, which has strengthened the confidence of many members in joining the cooperative and encouraged them to actively participate in production. More than 110 cooperatives in Chengjiang County have exceeded their sowing plans for oil crops. Agricultural production cooperatives that have completed autumn planting have now shifted to winter production activities. The Yipu Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxi County, through summarizing the experiences of autumn harvest and planting, has enabled members to further recognize the superiority of the cooperative. Now the members are repairing ditches, digging ponds, and accumulating fertilizer to prepare for increased production next year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    In areas of Yunnan Province where various ethnic minorities live in mixed or concentrated communities, there are now more than 750 agricultural production cooperatives composed of one or more ethnic groups. Among them, 424 are composed of two or more ethnic groups. Most of these agricultural production cooperatives were established this autumn. These cooperatives all have backbone members from their own ethnic groups. According to statistics from Chuxiong and Dali regions and Kunming City: Among the newly established ethnic minority agricultural production cooperatives this autumn, 1,862 people participated in the cooperative management committees, serving as directors, deputy directors, committee members, and accountants. In the Xinguang Agricultural Production Cooperative jointly organized by Yi and Han farmers in Rongfeng County, 57 percent of the leading cadres above the level of group leader are Yi people. In multi-ethnic cooperatives, members respect each other's ethnic customs. The Wang Santun Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qujing County, which includes both Hui and Han nationalities, stipulates that pigs are not raised within the cooperative, but are raised at home by Han members. In cooperatives with Yi members, ancestral land worship is generally not included in the cooperative activities. Issues such as work evaluation and scoring, and labor allocation, which arise from labor habits, are handled through joint consultation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南省新建的农业合作社转入冬季生产
    少数民族地区建立一批各民族农民组成的农业合作社
    云南省新建立的四千九百多个农业生产合作社，开始有计划有秩序地转入冬季生产。
    这些新社建立以后，中共云南省委员会就发出了巩固提高新社的指示，各级党委都加强了对新社的领导。玉溪、曲靖、楚雄、蒙自等专区和呈贡、泸西等大部分县、乡，都以老社带新社和召开社长、社员会议的办法，引导各社按照国家计划订出切实可行的生产计划；并帮助新社逐步建立一些经营管理制度，健全劳动组织。曲靖县熊祖能农业生产合作社，制订了较详细的工分制度，实行了小包工制，使很多社员坚定了入社信心，积极参加生产。澂江县一百一十多个社，已超额完成了油料作物的播种计划。结束了秋种的农业生产合作社，现在已转入冬季生产活动。泸西县逸圃乡第一农业生产合作社，通过总结秋收秋种经验，使社员对合作社的优越性有了进一步的认识，现在社员们正在修沟、开塘、积肥，为明年增产准备条件。　（新华社）
    云南省内地少数民族杂居和聚居地区，现在已有七百五十多个由一种少数民族或多种民族组成的农业生产合作社。其中有四百二十四个是由两种以上民族组成的。这些农业生产合作社大多是在今秋建立的。这些社都有本民族的骨干。据楚雄、大理两专区和昆明市材料统计：今秋新建的少数民族农业生产合作社中，就有一千八百六十二人参加社务管理委员会，分别担任社长、副社长、社务委员和会计等职务。榕峰县彝族和汉族农民共同组织的新光农业生产合作社，小组长以上领导骨干中，有百分之五十七是彝族。在多民族社里，社员们互相尊重民族习惯，有回、汉两种民族的曲靖县王三屯乡农业生产合作社，规定社内不养猪，由汉族社员自己在家里喂养。有彝族的社，祭祀田地一般都不入社。由于劳动习惯等所产生的评工记分、劳力分配等问题，都共同协商处理。　　（新华社）
