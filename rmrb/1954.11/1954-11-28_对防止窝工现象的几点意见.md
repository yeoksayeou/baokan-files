    Several Suggestions on Preventing Work Stoppage

    Editor's Note: Comrade Yang Defu of the Ministry of Labor has made suggestions to the Ministry of Supervision on preventing work stoppage in the construction industry. After research by the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the suggestions have been accepted. The Ministry of Supervision believes that Comrade Yang Defu's suggestions and the Ministry of Construction Engineering's spirit of accepting mass opinions are both very good, and has sent the relevant materials to this newspaper. They are now published as follows:

  Comrade Yang Defu's Letter of Suggestion

    Although the phenomenon of work stoppage and waste in the construction industry has decreased this year compared to last year, the situation is still very serious. For example, in the Northeast region, there were 41,000 workers idled in the second quarter. In the East China region, the Fifth Construction Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the former East China Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Shanghai Construction Engineering Bureau alone had more than 11,900 workers idled in June. In July, we conducted a survey of eight construction units in Beijing, including the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Engineering Company of the Ministry of Fuel Industry's Hydropower Bureau, the First Construction Engineering Company Directly Under North China, and the Fourth Construction Engineering Company Directly Under North China. According to statistics from March to July alone, more than 610,000 workdays were lost due to work stoppage (including workdays where skilled workers were used as unskilled laborers), and the expenditure on work stoppage amounted to more than 13.18 billion yuan (including wage difference subsidies for skilled workers used as unskilled laborers). Assuming a nationwide survey of all construction units, it can be found that the losses from work stoppage are staggering.

    There are many reasons for work stoppage, some of which are objective and difficult to solve in the short term. However, some shortcomings that exist in our subjective efforts have not been overcome in time, making the phenomenon of work stoppage even more serious. These shortcomings are: First, in order to complete tasks, many construction units often blindly fix and reserve a large number of workers. For example, among the workers in the above-mentioned eight units in Beijing, fixed workers account for 56.3%, reserved workers account for 26.5%, and temporary workers account for only 17.2%. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways does not even have a single temporary worker, and the reservation period for reserved workers is three years, which is also a disguised form of fixed employment. Basic construction projects are very complex and highly variable, and such a large number of fixed and reserved workers will inevitably lead to serious work stoppage and waste. Second, at present, work stoppage costs in construction units are not calculated in the cost, but can be paid from other expenses, which makes work stoppage and waste a "legal" matter, and some leading cadres in some units are complacent about this phenomenon. Third, labor administrative departments have not been able to guarantee the supply of labor needed by construction units in the allocation of construction workers, and the work of adjusting labor between construction units has not been done well enough.

    Based on the above situation, I propose the following three suggestions:

    One, abolish the provisions for reserved workers in construction units. The system of reserved workers was once beneficial to work in the past, but because labor administrative departments have continuously strengthened the allocation of construction workers, and the construction industry mostly adopts the method of hiring temporary workers, the system of reserved workers has no active role; in the future, if labor administrative departments are instructed to further strengthen the allocation of construction workers and ensure the timely supply of labor needed by construction units, the provisions for reserved workers can be abolished.

    Two, the reimbursement system for work stoppage and waste losses in construction units should be improved, and the competent departments should strengthen control and management in this regard, in order to correct the indifferent attitude of some units towards work stoppage and waste, and reduce the loss of national wealth.

    Three, the number of fixed civil engineering workers in construction units should be strictly limited. If it is necessary to increase the number, the labor administrative department should make appropriate adjustments between the units, so as to avoid the continued expansion of fixed workers.

    Reply Letter from the Ministry of Construction Engineering

    Comrade Yang Defu's suggestions on reducing work stoppage and waste are worthy of attention. In addition to notifying our affiliated units to study and summarize the experience of doing a good job in allocation and solving the problem of work stoppage, we have also made the following decisions:

      One, at present, there are many fixed workers in civil engineering in the construction units under our ministry. In general, units shall not increase fixed civil engineering workers without approval; if the existing fixed civil engineering workers in some units cannot meet the needs, they can first be resolved by adjusting between the units of the ministry. The increase of fixed workers in metal structure, electromechanical installation and special trades should also be approved by the ministry.

    Two, according to the characteristics of frequent changes in construction tasks, each unit can appropriately hire temporary workers as needed; however, in order to reduce work stoppage, if the local labor administrative department guarantees the timely supply of temporary workers, the reserved worker system should generally not be adopted in the future.

### 对防止窝工现象的几点意见

    对防止窝工现象的几点意见
    编者按：劳动部杨德福同志向监察部提出了关于防止建筑业中窝工现象的建议。经建筑工程部研究，已接受了这个建议。监察部认为杨德福的建议和建筑工程部接受群众意见的精神都是很好的，特将有关材料寄给本报。现发表如后：
  杨德福同志的建议信
    建筑业中的窝工浪费现象，今年虽较去年减少，但情况仍然很严重。如东北区第二季度窝工四万一千人。华东区仅中央建筑工程部第五建筑工程公司、原华东建筑工程局和上海建筑工程局三个单位六月份窝工就有一万一千九百多人。七月间，我们曾在北京市铁道部第一工程处、燃料工业部水电司工程公司、华北直属第一建筑工程公司、华北直属第四建筑工程公司等八个建筑单位作了一次调查，仅据三月到七月五个月的统计，窝工就达六十一万多个工作日（包括技工代壮工的工作日），开支窝工费共一百三十一亿八千多万元（包括技工代壮工的工资差额补助费）。假定在全国各建筑单位普遍进行一次调查，那么，可以发现窝工浪费的损失是十分惊人的。
    造成窝工的原因很多，其中有些客观原因一时难于解决。但是，由于我们主观上存在的某些缺点没有及时克服，使窝工现象更加严重了。这些缺点是：一、不少建筑单位为了完成任务，往往盲目地大量固定和预约工人。如北京市上述八个单位现有的工人中，固定工人占百分之五十六点三，预约工人占百分之二十六点五，临时工人仅占百分之十七点二。铁道部第一工程处甚至连一个临时工都没有，而且预约工人的预约期限为三年，也成了变相的固定工。基本建设工程是很复杂的，而且变动性很大，这样大量固定和预约工人的做法，必然会造成严重的窝工浪费。二、目前建筑单位中，窝工费不计算在成本费内，可以在其他费用内开支，这就使窝工浪费成了“合法”的事情，某些单位的领导干部也安于这种现象。三、劳动行政部门在建筑工人调配工作中还不能保证供应建筑单位所需的劳动力，在各建筑单位之间调剂劳动力的工作也做得不够好。
    根据以上情况，我提出如下三点建议：
    一、取消建筑单位中预约工人的规定。预约工的制度在过去的情况下对工作曾经是有利的，但由于劳动行政部门对建筑工人调配工作不断地加强，建筑业方面多采用雇临时工的办法，预约工的制度就没有什么积极作用了；今后，如果责成劳动行政部门进一步加强建筑工人调配工作，保证及时供应建筑单位所需的劳动力，预约工人的规定就可以取消。
    二、建筑单位窝工浪费损失的报销制度应加以改进，各主管部门在这方面应加强控制和管理，以纠正某些单位对窝工浪费的漠不关心的态度，减少国家财富的损失。
    三、应严格限制建筑单位的土木固定工人数量，如必须增加时，应由劳动行政部门在各单位之间进行适当调剂，以免固定工人继续扩大。  劳动部　杨德福
    建筑工程部的答复信
    杨德福同志关于减少窝工浪费问题的建议是值得重视的。我们除通知所属各单位研究总结做好调配工作、解决窝工问题的经验外，并作出以下决定：
      一、目前我部所属建筑单位中，土木方面的固定工人较多，各单位不经批准一般不得再增加土木固定工人；如某些单位现有土木固定工人不能满足需要时，可以先在本部各单位之间调剂解决。金属结构、机电安装和特殊工种方面的固定工人，也应该经部批准后才能增加。
    二、根据目前建筑任务经常变动的特点，各单位可以按需要适当雇用临时工人；但为减少窝工，在当地劳动行政部门保证及时供应临时工人的情况下，今后一般不得采用预约工人制度。  建筑工程部
