Delegation members Rotini and Corradini had returned home earlier.

Before their departure, three members of the goodwill delegation of the Indian Federation of Working Journalists, Sanai, Das Gupta, and Ramachandran, issued the following written statement:

"We are leaving in a few hours after a month or so of fruitful travel in this great and historic country. We bid farewell to the Chinese people, especially the Chinese journalists, with great reluctance. The friendship between India and China, two great countries with long-standing civilizations and common interests in peace, has been firmly established, which also signifies the friendship between journalists of the two countries. We have had valuable contacts during our trip and met members of the All-China Journalists Association in several places throughout China. We sincerely hope to maintain these contacts and further strengthen the friendship between journalists of the two countries. Indian journalists, like Chinese journalists, are also participating in the great renaissance that has been underway since gaining freedom and are trying to bring newspapers and the people closer together. We are very honored to have the opportunity to study the work of Chinese newspapers and the great role of Chinese journalists, and to bring back valuable lessons. We are confident that this understanding will be of great value in strengthening friendly ties between the two countries and in achieving the common goals of peace and rejuvenation. We express our sincere gratitude to the All-China Journalists Association for its gracious invitation and its hospitality and excellent arrangements during our trip. We are also grateful to the Chinese people for the warm welcome they gave us wherever we went."
