    Wuhan area is vigorously carrying out embankment construction work.
    In order to ensure that national construction and the people's safety in the Wuhan area are not threatened by floods, Wuhan City is vigorously carrying out embankment construction.
    On the embankment lines along the Yangtze River and rivers in Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang, as well as in the Zhanggong Embankment and Xiaozhanggong Embankment areas, a construction force of more than 20,000 people is working hard on embankment construction with the spirit of fighting flood control.
    Wuhan is located at the confluence of various rivers in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and its terrain is low-lying, often suffering from flood threats. Although Wuhan's embankments have been reinforced and repaired in previous years after liberation and during this year's flood season, there are still many weaknesses. In order to cooperate with industrial construction and the entire urban construction, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the instructions of higher authorities, have formulated the policy and plan for Wuhan's embankment construction. This policy and plan require that within a few years, the embankments of Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang be repaired in a planned manner; the revetments, waterproof walls, and slope protection projects along the rivers be renovated and newly built; riverside avenues on both sides of the Xiang River and riverside avenues in Hanyang be opened up; embankment roads be built within the Wuqing Embankment, Zhanggong Embankment, and Xiaozhanggong Embankment to support the embankments and facilitate transportation; and windbreak forests be planted outside the above-mentioned embankments as permanent wave-dissipating facilities; the Qingshan Sluice be newly built, and the Wutai Sluice and Daijiashan Sluice and other culverts be renovated and reinforced to solve the problem of waterlogging, so as to ensure the safety of national construction and the people in the Wuhan area under any circumstances. Now, various embankment lines are being constructed in accordance with the preliminary engineering plan to ensure that the temporary projects made during this year's flood season are renovated before the next flood season, and the existing embankments are raised and thickened so that they can withstand floods with water levels as high as this year.

    武汉地区大力进行堤防建设工作
    为确保武汉地区的国家建设和人民的安全不受洪水威胁，武汉市正大力进行堤防建设。
    在汉口、武昌和汉阳沿江、沿河的堤防线上以及张公堤和小张公堤一带，两万多人的建设队伍正以防汛的战斗的精神，紧张地进行堤防建设。
    武汉地当长江中游诸水的汇流处，地势低洼，时常遭受洪水的威胁；而武汉的堤防虽经解放后历年来及今年防汛中的培修，仍然存在很多弱点。为了配合工业建设和整个城市建设，中共武汉市委和武汉市人民政府根据上级的指示，制订了武汉市堤防建设的方针和方案。这个方针和方案要求在若干年内，有计划地修好汉口、武昌和汉阳的堤防；修整和新建沿江、沿河的驳岸、防水墙及护坡工程；开辟襄河两岸的沿河大道及汉阳的沿江大道；在武青堤、张公堤、小张公堤内修建堤腰公路，以支撑堤防，便利交通；并在上述各堤外面植防浪林，作为永久性的防浪设备；新建青山闸、改建和加固武泰闸及戴家山闸等涵闸，解决排渍问题；以便在任何情况下都能保证武汉地区的国家建设及人民的安全。现在各个堤防线上正按照初步的工程计划，进行施工，保证在明年汛期以前翻修好今年防汛期中所作的临时工程，加高培厚现有堤防，使之能够抵挡像今年这样高水位的洪水。
