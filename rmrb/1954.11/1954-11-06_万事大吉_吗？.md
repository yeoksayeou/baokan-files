Newspaper Review

	Is Everything "Going Swimmingly"?

	The Shanghai "Labor Daily" published on August 28th a reader's letter entitled "Why is Model Worker Yin Lingdi Feeling Distressed?" and an investigative report by the newspaper's reporter entitled "They Treat Advanced Things with a Bureaucratic Attitude." Using concrete facts, it exposed the problem of leaders at the state-owned Shanghai Light Bulb Factory believing that everything was "going swimmingly" after a model worker was selected, and no longer supporting the model worker's innovation proposals, nor summarizing and promoting the model worker's advanced ideas and experiences.

	Yin Lingdi is a female worker in the sealing workshop of the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory. Because she has always been ahead of others in production, she was selected as a Shanghai Municipal Industrial Model Worker in May this year. However, she was not satisfied with her past achievements. After returning to the factory from the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Model Worker Conference, she wanted to continue to achieve new results in production. However, after more than two months, her production results remained at the same level as before. When she saw in the newspaper that many model workers had made new achievements, she became even more anxious, as she herself said: "Sometimes looking at my model worker medal, I feel: I am very happy to see it, but I feel embarrassed when I think about it." Hasn't Yin Lingdi thought of ways to improve production? No, she has. As early as March of this year, Yin Lingdi and several workers researched a method to enlarge the glass shell neck of the light bulb, which could increase the sealing volume of light bulbs from 3,400 to 3,650 per day. However, the factory leaders treated this suggestion with a cold and irresponsible attitude, neither changing the bulb type nor explaining the reason to Yin Lingdi. Yin Lingdi felt that she could not play the leading, backbone, and bridge role of a model worker, and became increasingly distressed.

	The Shanghai "Labor Daily," after criticizing the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory leaders for not paying attention to cultivating model workers, also conducted education against the erroneous ideological sentiments of some workers in the factory who were jealous of and dissatisfied with the model workers. On September 2nd, the newspaper published an article by young worker Li Songqing, in which he examined his past mistakes of using sarcastic remarks to ridicule Yin Lingdi, fearing that changing the bulb type would require more work, deliberately saying that the change was not good, and being unwilling to learn from Yin Lingdi. On the same day, an article on "Ideological Cultivation" explained that every advanced experience and achievement of a model worker belongs to the collective of the working class. We should not be jealous of model workers, but should humbly learn from their strengths and contribute more to our collective cause.

	This criticism had a practical effect. On September 1st, the Shanghai "Labor Daily" published self-criticisms by the deputy secretary of the general branch of the Communist Party of China in the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory and the chairman of the factory's trade union, expressing their intention to change the simple use of model workers and to attach importance to publicizing and promoting Yin Lingdi's advanced ideas and experiences. On September 15th, the newspaper published a letter from Yin Lingdi saying that the factory leaders not only made a self-criticism after the report was published, but also asked the relevant departments to conduct experiments on the suggestion of changing the glass shell type; the results of the experiment were very good, and the factory administration had decided to formally adopt this suggestion. Young worker Li Songqing, who had made a self-criticism in the newspaper and whose past production performance was relatively poor, has increased the sealing volume of light bulbs to 3,800 per day. Yin Lingdi also made a self-criticism in the letter, stating that she must overcome the shortcomings of feeling distressed when encountering difficulties in the future.

	Similar to the bureaucratic attitude of the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory towards Yin Lingdi, the thinking and practice of believing that everything is "going swimmingly" after selecting a model worker is not an isolated phenomenon in some factories and enterprises. The Shanghai "Labor Daily" pointed out in a commentary on September 1st that factory leaders, especially trade union cadres, should learn a lesson from the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory incident and do a good job in cultivating model workers regularly and systematically.

	This criticism by the Shanghai "Labor Daily" is not only a helpful assistance to the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory, but also has educational significance for other units. (Hu Bingyue)

### “万事大吉”吗？

    “万事大吉”吗？
    八月二十八日的上海“劳动报”，登出了题为“劳模印玲娣为什么发生苦闷？”的读者来信和该报记者所写“他们用官僚主义态度对待先进事物”的调查报告。它以具体的事实，揭发了国营上海灯泡厂领导上评出劳动模范后就“万事大吉”，不再支持劳动模范的革新倡议，也不去总结和推广劳动模范的先进思想、先进经验的问题。
    印玲娣是上海灯泡厂封口工场的女工，由于她在生产上一直走在别人前面，今年五月被评选为上海市工业劳动模范。但她并没有满足于过去的成绩，在参加上海市工业劳动模范大会回厂后，她就想继续在生产上取得新的成绩，可是过了两个多月，她的生产成绩一直停留在过去的水平上。当她在报上看到许多劳动模范都有了新的成绩的时候，就更加着急，正如她自己所说的：“有时望着自己的劳模奖章，就感到：看看真高兴，想想难为情。”是不是印玲娣没有想过办法来提高生产呢？不是的。早在今年三月份，印玲娣就同几个工人一起研究出放大灯泡的玻壳颈的办法，照这个办法，能使灯泡封口量从每天三千四百只提高到三千六百五十只。但是该厂领导上却用冷淡的、不负责任的态度对待这个建议，不改变泡型，也不向印玲娣说明道理。印玲娣感到自己不能起到劳动模范的带头、骨干和桥梁作用，越来越苦闷。
    上海“劳动报”在批评了上海灯泡厂领导上不重视培养劳动模范之后，还针对该厂有些工人对劳动模范忌妒、不服气的错误的思想情绪，进行了教育。九月二日该报发表了青工李松青的一篇文章，对他过去用冷言冷语讽刺印玲娣，怕改变泡型多做生活，就故意说改了不好，以及不愿向印玲娣学习的错误态度作了检查。当天的报上，还在一篇“思想修养”的文章中说明：劳动模范的每一个先进经验和成就，都是属于工人阶级集体的，我们不应该忌妒劳动模范，而应该虚心学习他们的长处，共同为我们的集体事业贡献更大的力量。
    这一批评收到了实际的效果。在九月一日的上海“劳动报”上，中共上海灯泡厂总支委员会副书记和该厂工会主席，都作了检讨，表示要改变对劳动模范的单纯使用观点，重视宣传和推广印玲娣的先进思想和经验。九月十五日该报登出印玲娣的来信说：工厂领导上不但在见报后作了检讨，并且要有关部门对玻壳改型的建议进行了试验；试验的结果很好，工厂行政上已决定正式采用这个建议。曾在报上进行了自我批评、过去生产成绩比较差的青工李松青，已把灯泡封口量提高到每天三千八百只。印玲娣还在信中进行了自我批评，表示今后一定要克服过去遇见困难就产生苦闷的缺点。
    类似上海灯泡厂对待印玲娣的官僚主义态度，评出劳动模范后就认为“万事大吉”的思想和作法，在一些工厂企业中并不是个别的现象。上海“劳动报”在九月一日的评论中就曾指出：工厂领导干部特别是工会干部，都应该从上海灯泡厂的这件事中吸取教训，来经常地、有计划地做好培养劳动模范的工作。
    上海“劳动报”的这一个批评，不仅对上海灯泡厂是一次有益的帮助，并且对于其他单位说来，也有教育意义。  （胡冰岳）
