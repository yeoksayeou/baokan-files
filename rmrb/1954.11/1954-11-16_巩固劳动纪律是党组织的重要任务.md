Consolidating Labor Discipline is an Important Task of the Party Organization
    Pang Jiyun

    Labor discipline is a necessary condition for the normal progress of production and the victorious completion of the production plan. In modern factories, workers are highly concentrated, and each process is closely linked. Without strict labor discipline and highly centralized and unified command, it is difficult for factories to complete the state's production plan.
    The party organization of the factory has an important responsibility for consolidating labor discipline. The labor discipline of China's socialist state-owned enterprises is based on workers' conscious compliance. Although the consolidation of this labor discipline cannot lack the necessary means of administrative punishment, it mainly relies on education. The work of consolidating labor discipline is a kind of political work and an important task of the factory party organization.
    However, some factory party organizations do not recognize this. They believe that consolidating labor discipline is a matter for the trade union and the administration, not a task for the party organization. Some party committees and branches do not pay attention to the state of labor discipline in the factory for a long time, do not educate workers on labor discipline, have not talked with people who seriously violate labor discipline, and do not urge the administration to strictly deal with events that violate labor discipline.
    It is certainly wrong for the factory party organization to view the issue of labor discipline in this way. They have not recognized the importance of consolidating labor discipline for ensuring the completion of the production plan, and have not recognized that consolidating labor discipline is one of the important contents of the party's political work. The basic role of the party in the factory is to ensure the completion of the production plan, but if the workers' labor enthusiasm is not high, and they do not well observe labor discipline, and the party organization does not carry out the necessary political work in this regard, how can the completion of the production plan be guaranteed?
    In China's socialist state-owned enterprises, the main method of consolidating labor discipline is to educate workers, which is determined by the nature of socialist labor discipline.
    The labor discipline of slave society was maintained by clubs and whips, and the labor discipline of capitalism was maintained by the threat of unemployment and hunger. This is because in a society where the exploiting classes are in a dominant position, labor discipline is formulated to safeguard the interests of the exploiting classes, which contradicts the interests of the broad masses of working people. Therefore, the working people are unwilling to abide by this labor discipline and must be forced to abide by it by the exploiting classes.
    In socialist enterprises, the laborers have been freed from the exploiters and are no longer forced to labor by them in order to increase the profits of the exploiters. The labor discipline at this time is only for the needs of working together, for the development of socialist production and the increase of workers' welfare on this basis. Therefore, workers can consciously and voluntarily abide by this labor discipline.
    However, at this time, there will still be a small number of workers who are influenced by the old capitalist ideas, do not recognize that this new labor discipline is different from the previous compulsory discipline, and still look at the new labor discipline with the eyes of the old labor discipline. They cannot immediately develop the habit of consciously abiding by the new labor discipline, and it is not easy to subordinate personal interests to collective interests, so they will still produce acts that undermine labor discipline. It is necessary to educate workers on labor discipline, and it is necessary to consolidate labor discipline mainly through persuasive education.
    Some administrative cadres do not understand or do not actually understand that socialist labor discipline is conscious discipline, and that the main method of consolidating labor discipline is to educate workers. Therefore, when maintaining labor discipline, they do not pay attention to persuasive education, do not rely on the party organization and mass organizations of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and are excessively obsessed with the power of administrative punishment. However, it is impossible to maintain labor discipline for a long time by relying only on administrative punishment, and the effect will not be very great. Some administrative cadres do not pay attention to educating workers on labor discipline at ordinary times, and suddenly one day they publish a long list of punished people on the revealing board in front of the factory director's office, and the workers just pass by the revealing board and glance at it before walking away. When signing an order to give an administrative punishment to a worker who violates labor discipline, some factory directors neglect the education of workers and grassroots administrative responsible cadres, so after his order is issued to the workshop or work section, it is locked in the drawer of the desk by the workshop director or work section chief. It is difficult to make such a notice or order have much impact, and sometimes even the punished person himself does not know.
    Some party cadres and mass organization cadres think that it is not necessary to carry out education, and many workers will naturally abide by labor discipline. This is a manifestation of denying the party's leadership role and worshiping the spontaneous movement of workers. They do not pay attention to labor discipline education for workers, and do not criticize those workers who violate labor discipline. Therefore, they have promoted the development of the wrong thinking of a few workers, making them produce an illusion that the working class is now the master, and now that democracy is talked about, no one can control them. When workers violate labor discipline, some party and mass organization cadres simply complain that the working conditions are not good and that the administration does not solve the problem, and do not criticize the workers' mistakes. The administration gives the necessary and proper punishment to a small number of workers who violate labor discipline, and some party and mass organizations do not support it, and sometimes carry out inappropriate interference. They think that doing so is to stand firm on the position of the working class and protect the interests of the working class. In fact, this is precisely violating the position of the working class and undermining the interests of the working class, because socialist labor discipline and production order are destroyed, and socialist production suffers losses. Where is the position of the working class? Where can the interests of the working class be protected?
    The fundamental issue of consolidating labor discipline is to carry out communist education for workers, so that they treat labor and public property with a communist attitude, and criticize the influence of capitalist ideas on some workers in their attitude towards labor and public property.
    The party organization should educate workers to recognize the meaning of labor in socialist state-owned enterprises. The current task of China's working class is to build a socialist society. Socialist society cannot come about through fantasy, discussion and waiting, but must be created by people through struggle and labor. Our working class is participating in the construction of the great socialist society with its own labor. The building of socialism is built by our workers with every brick and stone, and no matter what they do, each worker's labor is a part of the great socialist construction.
    When a worker recognizes the social significance of his labor, he has communist awareness. At this time, he will be loyal to labor and abide by labor discipline out of his own wish.
    Why do some workers violate labor discipline? It is because they lack communist ideological awareness and are influenced by capitalist ideas. These workers still look at the labor of socialist enterprises with the eyes of looking at labor in capitalist enterprises in the old society, and regard labor as a heavy burden and a means for individuals to make a living. Therefore, they always want to escape labor, undermine labor discipline, and always want to take a little more from the state and do less themselves.
    New workers who have recently been added to the ranks of the working class have retained more non-working class ideological consciousness, and the phenomenon of violating labor discipline is more serious. For a time, they cannot consciously link their fate closely with socialist state-owned enterprises, and maintain a certain connection with small-scale production or the capitalist economy in ideology and life. Some workers regard the factory as a temporary "refuge" or hotel. They often jump from this factory to that factory, specializing in looking for the state's cheapness, or idling and dozing off in state-owned factories during the day, saving their energy, and going to private factories to work overtime at night. Some were originally farmers who came to the factory to "take refuge" when the harvest was bad, and wanted to go home to harvest crops when the autumn harvest was plentiful.
    Some workers often absent themselves from work, bringing significant losses to the enterprise: the production plan is forced to be disrupted, and the production task cannot be completed. What do these people do at home when they are absent from work? Some go to shovel the ground, fish, and plant melons; some go to buy and sell things. They are absent from work to do these things simply because they earn more income than earning wages in the factory. Judging from the reasons for these people's absenteeism, it is because they have been eroded by capitalist ideas.
    Among some young workers who have newly entered the factory, the phenomenon of violating labor discipline is particularly serious. This is because they do not have the habit of labor, have not been tempered by labor life, like to play, and wander around, so that they cannot concentrate on production. Some young workers dance until late at night after work, and of course they do not have the energy to produce well the next day. Being playful and greedy for enjoyment is also an influence of capitalist ideas.
    Therefore, the phenomenon of workers violating labor discipline is a manifestation of the influence of capitalist ideas. To consolidate labor discipline, it is necessary to criticize the influence of capitalist ideas among workers and improve the communist awareness of workers.
    When carrying out labor discipline education, the Party Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Steel Rolling Plant analyzed the various phenomena and ideological reasons for workers violating labor discipline, raised labor discipline education to the level of carrying out communist education for workers, and focused on criticizing the influence of capitalist ideas among workers, so that the labor discipline situation of the factory has been greatly improved.
    Liu Qingge, a worker in the heating section of the plant, had always violated labor discipline. The administrative leaders of the work section believed that there was really no way to deal with him, and the only thing to do was to fire him. Talking with him at the branch did not have much effect at first. He said: "I understand all these principles, but I just feel hot in front of the furnace and don't want to do it." Later, the masses wrote an article criticizing him in a blackboard newspaper. The content of the article was to describe how he had not worked well, did not listen to the foreman's command, slept on the night shift, and was late and left early, causing an accident of steel sticking to the furnace when he was on duty, from studying in a foreign factory to the start of production in this factory. There was a passage at the end of the article: "Liu Qingge, listen to me: don't rely on your big shop, turn around and do a good job quickly. Get rid of capitalist ideas quickly and return to the ranks of the working class." What was the matter with the article's "don't rely on your big shop"? Because Liu Qingge's family ran a big shop, he often boasted to people about how much better he ate at home than in the canteen, and that it didn't matter if he didn't work, etc. It turned out that his family's big shop was the backing for him not working well and often violating labor discipline. This article criticized his capitalist ideas, pointed out that capitalism has no future, cannot be relied on, and awakened his socialist consciousness, thus producing the due effect. After this criticism, Liu Qingge changed and was completely different from before. Not only did he abide by discipline and produce well, but he also actively participated in the propaganda work led by the party, painted propaganda posters, wrote blackboard newspapers, and criticized other workers who did not abide by labor discipline.
    Carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the workers is of great significance for consolidating labor discipline. Labor discipline is consolidated in the struggle between the advanced ideas and the backward ideas of the workers. The work of consolidating labor discipline is the criticism and self-criticism within the workers, the help of advanced workers to backward workers, and the victory of advanced ideas in the working class over backward ideas.
    Discussing a worker's behavior of undermining labor discipline at a workers' meeting or a group meeting, and publicly criticizing people who violate labor discipline in the blackboard newspaper, this is to pull individual discipline-destroying elements into the public eye to be judged by mass opinion, creating an atmosphere for these people so that they cannot continue to act recklessly.
    Specifically criticizing people who violate labor discipline is of great educational significance to everyone, because it is most powerful and easiest for people to accept to educate workers with specific examples of people who violate labor discipline. The workers can get vigilance from them: don't learn from them!
    All the workers of Class C of the Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Steel Rolling Plant held a comrade trial meeting for Zhang Yuying, a worker who often absented himself from work and stole scrap copper, which deeply educated him and everyone. At the trial meeting, many workers spoke, and these speeches showed the thinking and qualities of the working class. Some workers pointed out that there should not be such a person in the working class. If everyone stole like him, the large steel rolling plant would have to close down. Some workers said: "If you have financial difficulties, you should work hard. You can get more if you work more. But you are absent from work, isn't that making your life more difficult! If you don't work hard, you eat well in small restaurants after you get paid, and you steal when you run out of food. This is completely the bourgeois idea of 'no work, no gain'!" One worker interjected: "It's not glorious to eat fat without working!" After Zhang Yuying reported his history and said that he had been a soldier in the puppet Manchurian army, one worker said: "What you do is inseparable from your history. If it were in the old society, I don't know what kind of person you would have become. You might have been able to steal and rob; only in the new society have you been given the opportunity to work. Now that you have made a mistake, everyone is still helping you. In that society, you would have become a gangster; in this society, you have become a worker. Now, you should study hard and thoroughly transform yourself." This analysis is very profound and also very moving. Zhang Yuying expressed at the meeting that he would thoroughly correct himself and thanked everyone for their help. Now Zhang Yuying can work very well.
    In order to consolidate labor discipline, in addition to relying on education, it is also necessary to strengthen administrative management work, strengthen the responsibility system of administrative responsible cadres at all levels, and especially strengthen the responsibility of grassroots cadres.
    The administrative aspect of the factory has a direct responsibility for consolidating labor discipline. It organizes the labor of workers, supervises workers to implement various regulations and labor rules in the factory, and has the right to give administrative punishment to those who violate labor discipline and various regulations.
    The party organization of the factory must pay attention to consolidating the responsibility system of administrative responsible cadres, help the factory director and other administrative responsible cadres at all levels to establish leadership prestige, educate workers to obey the leadership of the factory director and other administrative responsible cadres, and resolutely implement administrative orders. At the same time, help administrative responsible cadres at all levels to be able to truly assume responsibility and have very strict requirements on all personnel in the factory, so that there can be good labor discipline.
    In some factories, administrative management is very lax. No one executes the orders issued by the factory director, and he does not investigate; when accidents occur, they shirk responsibility to each other, and no one can find out who is responsible; for those who violate labor discipline, they are not strictly dealt with, so the labor discipline there is also the most lax.
    The grassroots administrative responsible cadres (mainly the foreman level) are the direct leaders of the workers. They have the closest contact with the workers, directly command the workers to work, and the orders of the factory director and the workshop director must be passed through them to reach the workers. Therefore, they have a great responsibility for consolidating labor discipline. However, some foremen, squad leaders, and team leaders dare not command the workers, and have a mentality of accommodating backward workers. When they see workers violating labor discipline, they do not criticize them in person or report to the superiors, but hide things. Even some squad leaders saw workers sleeping on the night shift, afraid of waking them up, so they gently walked around them. These grassroots cadres have an incorrect idea: only by accommodating the workers can they get everyone's support, and can they lead the workers well; if they are too strict, they will be opposed by everyone, and it will be difficult to lead the workers. Some grassroots cadres who are willing to take responsibility, dare to manage workers and criticize workers' mistakes do encounter some obstacles in their work, but they have not received the support of the higher-level administration and party organization, and they will no longer be responsible in the future.
    The party organization should educate grassroots administrative responsible cadres to conscientiously perform their duties, dare to command and manage workers, not to accommodate backward workers, strictly deal with workers who violate labor discipline, and at the same time give their work active support, so that they have the necessary power in their hands. We stipulate that the foreman is the full authority leader of the production of the work section. If he does not have a little power, how can he become the full authority leader?
    The responsibilities of each foreman formulated by the Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Steel Rolling Plant based on the advanced management experience of Soviet factories stipulate that the foreman has the following powers: (1) issue instructions and orders to the personnel under his command and require them to implement them unconditionally; (2) report to the factory director for approval to promote outstanding workers, transfer or demote incompetent workers; (3) report to the factory director for disciplinary action against workers who violate labor discipline. But it is a pity that the large steel rolling plant itself did not fully implement these duties, and some foremen did not get the power they should have, so their role was not fully played.
    In order to consolidate labor discipline, and also to strengthen the leadership of workers' production, the party organization must educate and support grassroots cadres, so that they can fully play their role in the work of consolidating labor discipline.

### 巩固劳动纪律是党组织的重要任务

    巩固劳动纪律是党组织的重要任务
    庞季云
    劳动纪律是使生产正常进行和保证生产计划胜利完成的必需条件。在近代工厂中，工人很集中，各个工序紧密联系，如果没有严格的劳动纪律和高度集中统一的指挥，工厂就很难完成国家的生产计划。
    工厂的党组织对于巩固劳动纪律负有重要的责任。我国社会主义国营企业的劳动纪律是建立在工人自觉遵守的基础之上的。这种劳动纪律的巩固，虽然也不能缺少必要的行政处分的手段，但是主要地是靠进行教育。巩固劳动纪律的工作是一种政治工作，是工厂党组织的重要任务。
    但是有些工厂的党组织却不是这样认识的。他们认为巩固劳动纪律是工会和行政上的事情，不是党组织的任务。有的党委和支部长期不过问工厂劳动纪律的状况，不向工人进行劳动纪律的教育，没有和严重违反劳动纪律的人谈过话，也不督促行政去严格处理违反劳动纪律的事件。
    工厂党组织这样来看待劳动纪律问题当然是不对的。他们没有认识巩固劳动纪律对于保证生产计划完成的重要性，没有认识巩固劳动纪律是党的政治工作的重要内容之一。党在工厂的基本作用是保证生产计划的完成，但是如果工人的劳动积极性不很高，也不很好地遵守劳动纪律，而党组织又不在这方面进行必要的政治工作，生产计划的完成又如何能得到保证呢？
    在我国的社会主义国营企业中，巩固劳动纪律的主要方法是向工人进行教育，这是由社会主义劳动纪律的性质来决定的。
    奴隶社会的劳动纪律是靠棍棒和皮鞭来维持的，资本主义的劳动纪律是靠失业和饥饿的威胁来维持的。这是因为在剥削阶级占统治地位的社会里，劳动纪律是为了维护剥削阶级的利益而制定的，它与广大劳动群众的利益相矛盾，因此劳动者就不乐意遵守这种劳动纪律，而必须由剥削阶级强制他们去遵守。
    社会主义企业中，劳动者已经摆脱了剥削者，不再为了增加剥削者的利润而被他们强制劳动，这时的劳动纪律只是为了共同工作的需要，为了社会主义生产的发展和在此基础上工人福利的增长而服务的，因此工人就能自觉自愿地去遵守这种劳动纪律。
    但是这时还会有少数工人受了旧的资本主义思想的影响，不认识这种新的劳动纪律已经不同于从前的强制纪律，还用从前看待旧的劳动纪律的眼光去看待新的劳动纪律，一下子还不能养成自觉遵守新的劳动纪律的习惯，不容易以个人利益服从集体的利益，因而还会产生破坏劳动纪律的行为。这就必须向工人进行劳动纪律的教育，必须以说服教育的方法为主来巩固劳动纪律。
    有些行政干部不懂得或者实际上没有懂得社会主义的劳动纪律是自觉的纪律，巩固劳动纪律的主要方法是向工人进行教育，因此在维持劳动纪律时，不重视说服教育，不依靠党的组织和工会、青年团的群众组织，而过分地迷恋于行政处分的力量。但是只靠行政处分来维持劳动纪律是不能持久的，而且效果也不会很大。有的行政干部在平时不注意对工人进行劳动纪律的教育，忽然有一天在厂长办公室门前的揭示牌上公布了一大串被处分者的名单，工人们只从揭示牌前路过瞟了一眼就走过去了。有的厂长在签署给某一违反劳动纪律的工人以行政处分的命令时，忽视了对工人和基层行政负责干部的教育工作，因而他的命令发到车间或工段后，就被车间主任或工段长锁进办公桌的抽屉里去了。要想使这种通告或命令发生多大的影响是困难的，有的甚至连被处分的本人还不知道。
    有些党的干部和群众团体的干部以为不必进行教育，许多工人都会自然而然地遵守劳动纪律，这是一种否认党的领导作用、崇拜工人自发运动的表现。他们不重视对于工人的劳动纪律教育，不批评那些违反劳动纪律的工人，因此就助长了少数工人错误思想的发展，使他们产生一种错觉，以为现在工人阶级是主人翁了，现在讲民主了，谁也不能管他们。工人违反了劳动纪律，有的党和群众团体干部一味埋怨劳动条件不好，行政不解决问题，对工人的错误不加批判。行政上给予少数违反劳动纪律的工人以正当的必要的处分，有的党和群众团体组织不给予支持，有时还进行不适当的干涉。他们以为这样做就是站稳了工人阶级的立场，保护了工人阶级的利益，其实这正是违背了工人阶级的立场，破坏了工人阶级的利益，因为社会主义的劳动纪律和生产秩序遭到破坏，社会主义的生产受到损失，哪里还会有工人阶级的立场？哪里还能保护工人阶级的利益？
    巩固劳动纪律的根本问题是对工人进行共产主义教育，使他们用共产主义的态度去对待劳动和公共财产，批判有些工人在对待劳动和公共财产的态度上所受的资本主义思想的影响。
    党组织应教育工人认识在社会主义国营企业里劳动的意义。我国工人阶级的当前任务是建设社会主义社会，社会主义社会不是靠幻想、谈论和坐等就能来到，而是要人们用斗争和劳动去创造。我们工人阶级正是以自己的劳动去参加伟大的社会主义社会的建设事业。社会主义的大厦就是由我们工人的一砖一石建筑起来的，不管是作什么，每个工人的劳动都是伟大社会主义建设事业中的一部分。
    工人认识了他的劳动所具有的社会意义，就是具有了共产主义的觉悟。这时他就会忠诚劳动，出于心愿地遵守劳动纪律。
    有些工人为什么会违反劳动纪律呢？就是因为他们缺乏共产主义的思想觉悟，受了资本主义思想的影响。这些工人还用旧社会时在资本主义企业中看待劳动的眼光来看待社会主义企业的劳动，把劳动看成沉重的负担、个人迫不得已的谋取生活的手段，于是总想逃避劳动，破坏劳动纪律，总想从国家手里多拿一点，而自己少作一些。
    新近补充到工人阶级队伍中来的新工人，保留了更多的非工人阶级的思想意识，违反劳动纪律的现象更为严重。他们一时还不能将自己的命运自觉地同社会主义的国营企业紧密的联结起来，在思想上和生活上同社会上的小生产或资本主义经济保持
  一定的联系。有的工人是把工厂当作临时的“避难所”或旅店来看待的。他们经常由这一工厂跳到那一工厂，专去寻找国家的便宜，或者白天在国营工厂怠工、打瞌睡，保存着精力，夜间到私营工厂去加班生产。有的原是农民，年景不好时来到工厂“避难”，秋天丰收时就想回家去收庄稼。
    有些工人时常旷工，给企业带来重大的损失：生产计划被迫打乱，不能完成生产任务。这些人旷了工在家里干什么呢？有的去铲地、打鱼、种瓜；有的去买卖东西。他们旷工做这些事只是因为比在工厂挣工资收入多。从这些人旷工的原因来看，是由于他们受了资本主义思想的侵蚀。
    在一些新入工厂的青年工人中，违反劳动纪律的现象特别严重，这是因为他们没有劳动的习惯，没有经过劳动生活的锻炼，喜好玩耍，到处游荡，以致不能聚精会神地进行生产。有的青年工人下班后跳舞跳到深夜，第二天当然没有精力好好生产。好玩，贪图享受，这也是一种资本主义思想的影响。
    所以，工人违反劳动纪律的现象是一种资本主义思想影响的表现，要巩固劳动纪律，必须批判工人中的资本主义思想影响，提高工人的共产主义觉悟。
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂党委会在进行劳动纪律教育时，分析了工人中存在的各种违反劳动纪律的现象和思想原因，把劳动纪律的教育提高到向工人进行共产主义教育的水平，着重批判工人中的资本主义思想影响，使工厂的劳动纪律情况有很大的改善。
    该厂加热工段的工人刘庆阁一贯违反劳动纪律，工段行政领导人认为对他实在没有办法，只有开除了事。支部和他谈话，起初也不生多大效果。他说：“这些道理我全懂，就是在炉前嫌热，不愿意干。”后来群众在一期黑板报上写了一篇批评他的稿子。稿子的内容是叙述他从在外厂学习，直到本厂开工生产，一贯不好好工作，不听班长指挥，夜班睡觉，迟到早退，在他当班时造成钢料沾炉的事故。稿子的结尾有一段话：“刘庆阁，你听言：不要依仗你的大车店，赶快回头好好干。资本主义思想快除掉，回到工人阶级队伍里边。”稿子写的“不要依仗你的大车店”是怎么回事呢？因为刘庆阁家里开着一个大车店，他经常向人吹嘘，他在家里吃的比在食堂怎么好，他不做工也不要紧等等，原来他家里的大车店就是他不好好生产、经常违反劳动纪律的靠山。这篇稿子批判了他的资本主义思想，指出了资本主义没有前途，不能指靠，唤醒了他的社会主义觉悟，因而发生了应有的效果。经过这次批评后，刘庆阁转变了，与从前迥然不同了，不仅遵守纪律，好好生产，而且积极参加党所领导的宣传工作，画宣传画，写黑板报，批评别的不遵守劳动纪律的工人。
    开展工人内部的批评和自我批评，对于巩固劳动纪律有很重要的意义。劳动纪律是在工人的先进思想同落后思想的斗争中巩固起来的，巩固劳动纪律的工作就是工人内部的批评和自我批评，就是先进工人对于落后工人的帮助，就是工人阶级中的先进思想克服落后思想的胜利。
    在工人大会或小组会上讨论一个工人的破坏劳动纪律的行为，在黑板报上公开批评违反劳动纪律的人，这就是把个别破坏纪律的分子拉到大庭广众之下，受群众舆论的裁判，对这些人造成一种气氛，使他们不能继续胡作非为下去。
    具体地批评违反劳动纪律的人，对于大家有极大的教育意义，因为用违反劳动纪律的人的具体事例来教育工人是最有力量的，最容易被人接受的。工人们从他们那里能得到警惕：不能学他们的样子！
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂丙班全体工人对于经常旷工和偷盗废铜的工人张玉英举行了一次同志审判会，使他本人和大家都受到了深刻的教育。在审判会上，有许多工人发言，这些发言表现出了工人阶级的思想和品质。有的工人指出，工人阶级中不应有他这样的人，如果大家都像他这样偷，大型轧钢厂就要关门停工了。有的工人说：“你生活困难，就应好好干活，多劳才能多得，而你又旷工，这不是更使你生活困难么！不好好干活，发了工资又好吃小馆，吃没了就偷，这完全是‘不劳而获’的资产阶级思想！”有一个工人插嘴说：“不干活，吃的再胖也不光荣！”在张玉英报告他的历史说他伪满时当过兵以后，有一个工人说：“你做的事和你的历史是分不开的，如果在旧社会，不知你要变成个什么样的人，偷盗，抢劫，你都可能作得出来；只有在新社会，给了你做工的机会，现在你犯了错误，大家还帮助你。在那个社会，你会成为一个流氓，在这个社会，你就成了工人。现在，你应学好，彻底转变。”这个分析是很深刻的，也是很感动人的。张玉英在会上表示要彻底改正，并感谢大家对他的帮助。现在张玉英已能很好的工作了。
    巩固劳动纪律，除了靠进行教育以外，还必须加强行政管理工作，加强各级行政负责干部的责任制度，特别要加强基层干部的责任。
    工厂的行政方面对于巩固劳动纪律负有直接的责任，它组织工人的劳动，监督工人执行厂内的各种规程和劳动规则，对于违反劳动纪律和各种规程的人有权给予行政处分。
    工厂的党组织必须注意巩固行政负责干部的责任制，帮助厂长和其他各级行政负责干部树立领导威信，教育工人服从厂长和其他行政负责干部的领导，坚决执行行政的命令。同时帮助各级行政负责干部使他们能够真正负起责任，对全厂人员的要求都很严格，这样，才能有良好的劳动纪律。
    有的工厂，行政管理工作很松懈。厂长发下的命令没人执行，他也不追究；发生事故，互相推诿，找不出是谁的责任；对于违反劳动纪律的人，不进行严格处理，因此，那里的劳动纪律就也是最松懈的。
    基层的行政负责干部（主要是工长这一级）是工人的直接领导者，他们和工人联系最密切，直接指挥工人劳动，厂长和车间主任的命令必须经过他们才能下达到工人那里。所以他们对于巩固劳动纪律，有很大的责任。但是有些工长、班长和组长不敢指挥工人，对落后工人存在着迁就的心理。看见工人有违反劳动纪律的行为，他们不当面批评，也不向上级报告，而是把事情隐瞒起来。甚至有的班长在夜班时看见工人睡觉，生怕惊醒了他，就轻轻地绕过他的身旁走开了。这些基层干部有一种不正确的想法：只有对工人迁就，才能得到大家的拥护，才好领导工人；如果太严了，就会遭到大家的反对，就不好领导工人了。有些肯负责任、敢于管理工人和批评工人错误的基层干部，在工作中确实受到一些阻碍，但是也没有得到上级行政和党组织的支持，以后他也就不再负责任了。
    党组织应该教育基层行政负责干部认真执行他们的职责，敢于指挥和管理工人，不要迁就落后的工人，严格处理违反劳动纪律的工人，同时给他们的工作以积极的支持，要使他们手里拥有必要的权力。我们规定工长是本工段生产的全权领导者，如果他没有一点权力，怎能成为全权领导者呢？
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂根据苏联工厂的先进管理经验所拟定的各个工长的职责条例，都规定了工长有这样的权力：（一）向所属人员下达指示和命令，并要求其无条件执行；（二）报告厂长批准，提升优秀的工人，调动或降职不称职的工人；（三）对于违反劳动纪律的工人，报告厂长给以纪律处分。但是可惜大型轧钢厂自己并没有完全执行这些职责条例，有的工长并没有获得他应有的权力，因此他们的作用也没有充分发挥。
    为了巩固劳动纪律，也为了加强对工人生产的领导，党组织必须教育和支持基层干部，使他们能够在巩固劳动纪律的工作中充分发挥作用。
