    Workers of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company Intensify Their Study of Advanced Soviet Experience
    The workers of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company have launched a high tide of studying advanced Soviet experience.
    After the publication of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company convened several meetings in succession to discuss how to complete the new tasks brought about by the transfer of the Soviet shares of the company to our country. The meeting held that it is necessary to seize the time to summarize the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in order to continue to implement and execute it in the future. Now, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, personnel have been specially drawn from various departments to form six summary groups for planning management, technical management, financial and commercial management, shipbuilding, personnel and education. The cadres, workers, technicians and staff of the company, feeling the increase in their responsibilities, are working even harder to learn from Soviet experts. In the shipyard, Soviet expert Comrade Mofedovsky personally taught many electric welding workers the technology of operating automatic welding machines. These days, after work during the day, he often comes to the place where Zhang Hongzeng's group works in the evening to check their production and give technical guidance. In the foundry, Soviet experts have disseminated a large amount of advanced experience such as standard sprues, large sand molding, shower sprues, and centrifugal casting, which has significantly reduced the waste of castings. Now, the cadres and workers of the factory are also further studying and summarizing these experiences, and raising questions that have not been thoroughly understood to ask Soviet experts for advice. The atmosphere of learning advanced Soviet experience is even stronger in various departments. The Economic Planning Section used to have one business study session a week, but now it has been changed to two. In the Valuation Section, people ask Soviet experts for advice more often, and the experts help even more patiently. Soviet expert Gagunov said happily: "I hope you will ask questions immediately, the more questions the better." After the publication of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué, the Party, administrative, and trade union cadres of the Design Section studied and formulated a plan for further learning from Soviet experts. About 70% of the section has a basic understanding of Russian, and they plan to translate some applicable Soviet design materials, on the one hand to learn from Soviet design experience, and on the other hand to improve their Russian proficiency.

    中苏造船公司职工加紧学习苏联先进经验
    中苏造船公司职工掀起了学习苏联先进经验的高潮。
    中苏会谈公报发表以后，中共中苏造船公司委员会连续召开了几次会议，讨论如何完成由于公司的苏联股份移交给我国而带来的新的任务。会议认为：必须抓紧总结苏联的先进经验，以便今后继续贯彻和执行。现在在党委的统一领导下，已由各科室抽调专人，组成计划管理、技术管理、财务和商务管理、造船、人事和教育等六个总结小组。该公司的干部、工人、技术人员和职员由于感到自己责任的加重，都更加紧地向苏联专家学习。在造船厂，苏联专家莫费道夫斯基同志曾经亲自教会了许多电焊工人操纵自动电焊机的技术。这几天，他白天工作之后，还时常在晚上来到张洪增小组工作的地方，检查他们的生产，并给以技术上的指导。在铸造厂，苏联专家曾传播了标准水口、大砂子造型、雨淋水口、离心铸造等大量的先进经验，使铸件废品显著地减少。现在，该厂干部和工人也都在进一步学习并总结这些经验，并把没有彻底了解的问题，提出来向苏联专家请教。各科室学习苏联先进经验的空气更加浓厚了。经济计划科过去每星期有一次业务学习，现在改为两次。在估价科，人们向苏联专家请教的次数更多了，专家们也更耐心地帮助。苏联专家加古诺夫同志高兴地说：“我希望你们有问题马上就问，问题越多越好。”设计科在中苏会谈公报发表以后，党、行政、工会的干部就在一起研究订立了进一步向苏联专家学习的计划。该科已约有百分之七十的人初通俄文，他们计划要翻译一些适用的苏联设计资料，一方面学习苏联的设计经验，另一方面也提高自己的俄文水平。
