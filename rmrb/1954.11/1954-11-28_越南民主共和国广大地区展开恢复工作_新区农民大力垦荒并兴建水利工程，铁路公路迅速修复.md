    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 26th: In the vast areas of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, north of the temporary military demarcation line, work is rapidly progressing to heal the wounds of war and restore farmland, water conservancy systems, and transportation systems.

    Farmers in the newly liberated areas are responding to the government's call and are vigorously reclaiming land abandoned during the war and the no-man's-lands created by the French army. These no-man's-lands are scattered across nearly twenty provinces in the Red River Plain and the Northwest region, totaling over 114,000 hectares. In the fields of the Red River Delta, wisps of white smoke from burning weeds for land reclamation can be seen everywhere. Many places that were barren fields four months ago have now become connected stretches of paddy fields. According to relevant statistics, from the ceasefire to mid-November, more than 11,000 hectares of wasteland have been restored. Including the wasteland that was restored before the ceasefire, the total amounts to 20,000 hectares.

    The work of restoring and rebuilding water conservancy projects has successively unfolded in Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Thai Nguyen, Bac Giang, Ha Dong, Ha Nam, Son Tay and other provinces. Among them, the important water conservancy projects under reconstruction include the Bai Thuong sluice gate on the Chu River in Thanh Hoa Province, the Thac Huong sluice gate on the Cau River in Thai Nguyen Province, and the Lien Mac sluice gate on a tributary of the Red River in Ha Dong Province. At present, many construction sites have been equipped with electric lights, and tens of thousands of people are working day and night on the dams. Convoys of heavy trucks are driving along the highways to the construction sites, continuously transporting steel, timber, and cement. It is reported that the renovation projects of the Lien Son irrigation system in Vinh Phuc Province and the Cau Son irrigation system in Bac Giang Province will commence at the end of November.

    The restoration of the railway and highway trunk lines centered on Hanoi is also actively underway. The Nam Quan railway, connecting Hanoi to the Sino-Vietnamese border, began to be repaired shortly after the liberation of Hanoi. Although this line was dilapidated, overgrown with weeds, and had many winding trenches and iron deer fences, and some roadbeds were completely submerged, Vietnamese engineering teams have basically completed the construction of this 150-kilometer-long roadbed in just one month and will soon begin laying tracks. At the same time, some highway trunk lines connecting Hanoi to the provincial capitals are also being repaired.

    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pays great attention to the restoration and reconstruction work. In addition to allocating huge sums of money for the construction of railways and water conservancy projects, the Republic government has also provided large amounts of funds to help farmers rebuild their homes. Incomplete statistics from October 15 to November 22 show that the government has distributed 6,726 tons of food and seeds to farmers who are reclaiming wasteland. The State Bank of Vietnam has also loaned out 3,400 head of cattle, 1,500 tons of chemical fertilizers, and a large number of agricultural tools. Currently, the work of providing interest-free loans to farmers who lack food, seeds, and agricultural tools is still continuing.

    越南民主共和国广大地区展开恢复工作
    新区农民大力垦荒并兴建水利工程，铁路公路迅速修复
   【新华社河内二十六日电】在越南临时军事分界线以北的越南民主共和国的广大地区内，医治战争创伤和恢复农田水利和运输系统的工作正在迅速进行。
    新解放区农民响应政府的号召，正在大力开垦在战争期间荒废的田地和法军制造的无人区，这种无人区遍及红河平原和西北地区的将近二十个省份，总面积在十一万四千公顷以上。在红河三角洲的原野上，到处可以看到为了开荒而焚烧荒草的缕缕白烟。许多地方在四个月前还是荒凉的田野，现在已变成一片片相连的水田。据有关方面统计，从停战以后到十一月中旬，已经恢复的荒地有一万一千多公顷，连同在停战前已恢复耕种的荒地计算进去，就有两万公顷。
    水利工程的恢复和重建工作在清化、义安、太原、北江、河东、河南、山西等省先后展开。其中正在重建的重要水利工程有：清化省朱江上的沛上水闸、太原省桥河上的拓况水闸和河东省红河支流上的联模水闸。目前许多工地上已装上电灯，成千上万的人日夜在坝上工作。成队的载重卡车沿着公路向工地开去，不断地把钢材、木料和水泥运去。据悉，永福省的联山和北江省的求山灌溉系统的整修工程即将在十一月底动工。
    以河内为中心的铁路和公路干线的恢复工作也在积极进行中。河内通到中—越边境的南关铁路，在河内解放后不久即开始修复。尽管这条线路残破不堪，长满野草，有许多弯曲的壕沟和铁鹿砦，有些路基完全湮没，但是越南工程队已经在短短的一个月里把这条长达一百五十公里的路基基本上修筑完毕，即将开始铺轨。同时，正在修复中的还有河内通往各省省会的一些公路干线。
    越南民主共和国政府对恢复重建工作给以很大的关注。共和国政府除了拨出巨款修建铁路和水利工程外，还以大批款项帮助农民重建家园。仅从十月十五日到十一月二十二日的不完全统计，政府发放给恢复荒地的农民的口粮和种籽已达六千七百二十六吨。越南国家银行也已经贷出了三千四百头耕牛，一千五百吨化学肥料和大批的农具贷款。目前，向缺少口粮、种籽和农具的农民发放无息贷款的工作仍在继续进行。
