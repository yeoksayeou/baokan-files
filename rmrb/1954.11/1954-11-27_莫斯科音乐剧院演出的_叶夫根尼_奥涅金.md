The important position of Pushkin in the history of Russian literature is clearly stated by Gorky: "The founder of great Russian literature." More importantly, "Pushkin was the first to feel that literature is a state undertaking of paramount importance... the poet is the expression of the various emotions and thoughts of the people." Contrary to any "pure art theorists," Pushkin, in his poems, novels, and narrative poems, praised the people's free will, described the life of contemporary society, and created typical characters. In his narrative poem "Boris Godunov," he expressed the idea that the masses are the driving force of history; this narrative poem was brilliantly adapted into an opera by the great composer Mussorgsky. In "Eugene Onegin," he narrates the tragic story of the aristocratic intellectuals of the time who, even if they tried to escape the vulgar life of high society, ultimately accomplished nothing. Another great Russian composer, Tchaikovsky, created an immortal lyric opera based on this narrative poem, which, like "Boris Godunov," became an immortal treasure in the world's musical culture.

"Eugene Onegin," as the poet himself said, is a novel in verse, and also the first Russian novel with a social life theme. In this narrative poem, the poet describes typical characters, their psychological characteristics, and the social reasons for the emergence of these characters, as Belinsky said:
"‘Eugene Onegin’ can be called an encyclopedia of Russian life and a work of the highest degree of national character."

Eugene Onegin can be said to be a typical representative of the aristocratic intellectuals of the 1820s. In the families of exploiters, he was cultivated into a fashionable figure with culture, education, and wit. However, this clever aristocratic son, while participating in the social life of banquets and dances in high society, also saw the class contradictions and various unreasonable phenomena in the social life of the time. On the one hand, he moves among the so-called noble social life, but he also has the idea of not being willing to be mediocre; on the one hand, he pursues the passion of love, but he also sees the unhappiness in hypocritical or mediocre married life; he also tries to bury himself in books to find a way out, but his education and origin make him lack the ability and courage to participate in practical social activities. The narrative poem tells the story of him rejecting the passion of a young girl, and then killing his friend in a duel because of a ridiculous joke; when he meets again the girl he rejected, who is now a noblewoman, he tries to rekindle the past love; but he is finally rejected, and even this fantasy of love is shattered. Through such a story, the character and image of the so-called "superfluous man," an educated and talented but ultimately unsuccessful person, is powerfully portrayed.

Tchaikovsky created exceptionally moving musical images based on this narrative poem. This opera can be said to be the model of Russian and world lyric opera. Like all of Tchaikovsky's works, it is filled with sincere emotion, rich melodies, and perfect orchestration from beginning to end. There are no theatrical dramatic effects throughout, but it can give people a sense of deep emotional infection everywhere.

The great Russian dramatist Stanislavsky made an outstanding stage adaptation of this opera. He first gave the characters flesh and blood, turning them into distinctive figures, deeply explored the psychological activities of the roles, and gave people a highly realistic infection. Whether it is the main characters, Tatyana, Lensky, Onegin, or other roles, such as the nurse, Larina, Olga, Triquet, and Prince Gremin, they all have distinct and different personalities.

In opera performances, because the characters do not use everyday speaking forms, but use recitative, lyric, duet, and chorus musical forms to express the characters' thoughts and feelings, how to have the reality of life in the performance, so that people do not feel that the characters are using singing to describe their emotions, is indeed a very difficult subject. In the past, opera actors often replaced everything with "bel canto," often adopting exaggerated and formulaic movements. However, if actors perform opera with purely natural and living movements, it will inevitably conflict with the requirements of the musical form sung by the characters, and even hinder the correct interpretation of the music.

It should be pointed out that through the creative work of the great theatrical masters Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, fundamental changes have taken place in opera and ballet performance art. The stylized performance methods on the old-style opera stage have been cleared away; on the other hand, through the infinite care and help of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people for musical art, the musical formalism that once appeared on the Soviet opera stage and the naturalistic tendencies in performance that were influenced by it have also been criticized. The Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre, under the guidance of correct principles and correct artistic creation principles, has healthily developed the excellent Russian opera and ballet art tradition, creating a brilliant Soviet opera and ballet school.

From the first scene of the opera, through the duet and quartet, the characters of the landlady Larina's family are completely introduced. In a short chapter, the four characters each sing their own thoughts: Larina and the nurse recall the days gone by and their youth, while the pensive and dignified Tatyana and the innocent and willful Olga form a very touching contrast.

In the next scene, the chorus does not appear, which should be said to be a very clever treatment. It is said that Stanislavsky made this arrangement because the stage was too small for the first performance. However, in our opinion, the non-appearance of the peasants' chorus avoids the embarrassing scene of the peasants meeting the landlady in the original script, making this scene more poetic. We should thank the theater's excellent chorus conductor and outstanding chorus, who, although not appearing on stage, created moving musical images and successfully performed this beautiful music of the peasants' chorus and dance.

Olga's little aria in this scene and the following scene further describe the characters of Tatyana and Olga. Tatyana says:
     "With the singing,
      I fantasize about the distance."
While Olga says:
     "You are always fantasizing,
      And the singing only gives me joy."
In this way, two different character personalities are displayed on the stage.

The quartet and the subsequent scenes introduce the two male protagonists. Onegin, who comes from the big city, is surprised by the pastoral atmosphere of the landlady's manor, but at the same time seems so indifferent. Lensky expresses the complete opposite, expressing his love to Olga in the scene, fully expressing his passionate and excited personality.

In the second scene of the first act, in the dialogue between Tatyana and the nurse, the nurse recounts the scene of her own old-fashioned married life; and Tatyana, the girl who has fallen in love, expresses extreme anxiety and uneasiness; the moving musical image and the moving performance make people seem to foresee the beginning of the tragedy. Then comes the famous letter scene. In this long lyric, the complex psychology of the girl who is tormented in love is deeply described: shyness, fear, expectation, anxiety. The actress Smirnova successfully portrayed the character, her every movement and gesture has a clear purpose, and there is full of emotion in the singing.

The third scene begins with a joyful female chorus, making a contrast and foreshadowing of Tatyana's unfortunate love encounter. The chorus actors did not appear on stage, which minimized the appearance of unnecessary characters, giving this lyric opera a more perfect style. In Onegin's aria scene, the actor Shabinko gave a wonderful performance. He rejected Tatyana's love with a reserved and indifferent tone, and said:
     "If I were willing to spend my life,
      Tied to a trivial family;
      If I had such good luck,
      To be a husband and a father;
      Then, indeed, perhaps except for you,
      I would not seek anything else. ............
      But, believe me,
      Married life will be asceticism for us,
      After a long time, love will be impossible to find."
The actor's left eyebrow often raised upwards, making Onegin's self-esteem and indifference very prominent and moving. The chorus's voice reappeared, their joyful voices further highlighting Tatyana's hurt emotions. It should be said that this is the ingenious arrangement of the great composer.

The first scene of the second act can be said to be a portrayal of the social life of the landlords in the Russian provinces at that time. The treatment of the musical theater makes this genre painting even more moving. There are arrogant junior officers, as well as those garrulous old women, especially the French client Triquet, who sings a purely "salon style" poem "Beautiful Tatyana", which can be said to be a sharp satire on the pretentious and affected fashion music style of the time. Those old women who have nothing to do after eating are discussing this and that. In this way, Onegin's thought of showing courtesy to Olga in mischief was aroused, causing the easily impulsive Lensky to be jealous, so that he had to make a request for a duel with Onegin. The joyful banquet turned into an unpleasant scene. Here, the composer and performers truthfully portrayed the cowardly side of Onegin's character.

The duel scene is the most touching scene. Here, the artist Lushen of the musical theater arranged this set extremely perfectly. It was a winter morning, and the overall color tone already hinted at the arrival of the tragedy.

It must be mentioned here that the stage design of this opera can be said to be one of the typical examples. Using eight Greek-style columns as the basis for the set of each scene except for the duel scene, this makes the set of the whole play have a unified and harmonious tone, and it seems so economical and reasonable.

In the duel scene, there is Lensky's famous aria. The actor Nashayevsky recalled the past and longed for the present with a voice full of emotion. This lyric can be said to be a perfect description of Lensky's character in musical image. The duel began, Lensky was killed, Onegin's frightened expression, as if he himself did not know what he had done.

The third act is the luxurious mansion of Prince Gremin. Onegin returned from abroad, and when he learned that the Duchess was Tatyana, he seemed so lost. And the Prince's quiet lyric showed satisfaction and happiness. The actor Dudrev sang this music with a soft bass. The last low G, the lyrics are: the word "happiness", the soloist perfectly expressed the meaning of the lyrics with such a calm voice.

Then came Onegin's aria. Now, the pensive provincial girl who is already a noblewoman has aroused the love that he once rejected. In the last scene, Tatyana rejected the love of this Onegin, who had no pride left. This "superfluous man" who accomplished nothing, even the love he once rejected, could not get. At the end of the opera, on the stage is the desperate Onegin, with such an excited voice, even the voice he was forced to accept the duel was not so excited, shouting:
     "Shame, heartache,
      Ah! My desperate fate!"
As if this time really touched his heart.

The great classical masters of Russia developed opera and ballet music to such a brilliant level, mainly because from Pushkin onwards, the progressive aristocratic intellectuals and civilian intellectuals of Russia were carrying out patriotic enlightenment movements and democratic activities in various fields of literature and art. And these activities are increasing day by day, and have a wider foundation and scope. Therefore, masters such as Glinka, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov were also produced in musical art. Astonishing achievements have also been made in various fields of musical art. If the great Pushkin attempted to describe the theme of social life in the form of a narrative poem, then Glinka and Mussorgsky were the composers who began to describe the heroes of the people and the theme that the people are the creators of history in the form of opera. In addition to epic operas, Tchaikovsky can be said to be the master who laid the initial foundation and model for lyric opera.

Under the personal guidance of the great theatrical master Stanislavsky, the Moscow Musical Theatre made an insurmountable stage treatment for this exquisite opera. This opera has been performed more than a thousand times, and today it still has a strong fragrance when we look at it. (Attached picture)

    莫斯科音乐剧院演出的“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”
    中国音乐家协会秘书长　赵沨
    普希金在俄国文学史上的重要的地位，高尔基说得很清楚：“伟大的俄罗斯文学的创建者”，更重要的是：“普希金第一个感觉到，文学是一件具有头等重要性的国家事业，……诗人是人民的各种感情和思想的表现者”。和任何“纯艺术论者”相反，普希金在自己的诗篇、小说、长诗中，歌颂了人民的自由的意志，描写了当代社会的生活，创造了典型的人物形象。在他的长诗“波里斯·戈都诺夫”中，表现了人民群众是历史的动力这一思想；这篇长诗由伟大的作曲家莫索尔斯基用歌剧的形式在舞台上作了光辉的处理。在“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”中，叙述了当时的贵族知识分子即使勉力摆脱上流社会的庸俗生活但终于一事无成的悲剧故事；另一个伟大的俄罗斯作曲家柴可夫斯基，根据这篇长诗创作了不朽的抒情歌剧，和“波里斯·戈都诺夫”同样成为世界音乐文化中的不朽的瑰宝。
    “叶夫根尼·奥涅金”长诗，正如诗人自己所说，是一种诗体的长篇小说，同时也是俄罗斯第一部长篇的社会生活题材的小说。在这篇长诗中，诗人描写了典型的人物、他们的心理特征以及所以产生这种人物的社会原因，正如别林斯基所说的：
  “‘叶夫根尼·奥涅金’可以称之为俄国生活的百科全书和最高度的人民性的作品。”
    叶夫根尼·奥涅金可以说是十九世纪二十年代的贵族知识分子的典型代表，在剥削者的家庭中，他被培养成为一个有文化有教养有风趣的时髦人物，但这聪明的贵族公子，在参加上流社会饮宴舞乐的社交生活之余，也看到了当时社会生活中的阶级矛盾和各种不合理现象。他一方面周旋于所谓高尚的社交生活之中，但他也有不甘庸俗的想法；他一方面追逐恋爱的热情，但他也看到了虚伪的或者是平庸的婚姻生活中的不幸；他也企图埋首在书籍中寻找出路，但他的教育和出身使他缺乏参与实际社会活动的能力和勇气。长诗叙述他拒绝一个少女的热情，而又由于荒唐的玩笑在决斗中杀死了自己的朋友；当他重又遇见已经是贵妇人的那个被他拒绝过的少女时，他却又企图重燃过去的恋情；但是他终于被拒绝了，连这一点爱情的幻想也破灭了。通过这样的故事，有力地刻划了所谓“多余的人”、有教养有才能但却一事无成的人的性格和形象。
    柴可夫斯基根据这篇长诗创造了异常动人的音乐形象，这部歌剧可以说是俄罗斯、也是世界抒情歌剧的典范。像柴可夫斯基的全部作品一样，自头至尾充满着真挚的感情，丰富的曲调，完美的管弦乐；通篇没有那种剧场式的戏剧性效果，但到处都可以给人以至情的感染。
    伟大的俄罗斯戏剧家斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基对这个歌剧作了卓越的舞台处理。他首先赋与了剧中人以血肉，使之变成个性鲜明的人物，深刻地发掘了角色的心理活动，给人一种极富真实性的感染。无论是主角妲姬雅娜、连斯基、奥涅金或是其他的角色，如乳母、拉林娜、奥耳迦、特里凯、格烈明侯爵，都有着鲜明的不同性格。
    歌剧的表演，由于人物不用日常的说话形式，而是用朗诵调、抒情调、重唱和合唱的音乐形式来表达人物的思想和感情，因而在表演上如何能具有生活的真实性，令人不感觉到剧中人是用唱歌来描写自己的情感，确是一件非常困难的课题。过去的歌剧演员，常常用“美声”代替了一切，经常采用程式的夸张的动作。但是，如果演员用纯粹自然生活的动作来表演歌剧，便一定和剧中人所咏唱的音乐形式的要求发生矛盾，甚至会妨碍对音乐的正确解释。
    应该指出，通过伟大的戏剧大师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科创造性的工作，使歌剧、舞剧表演艺术发生了根本的变化。旧式歌剧舞台上的程式化的表演方法被清除了；另一方面，通过苏联共产党和苏联人民对音乐艺术的无限关怀和帮助，在苏联歌剧舞台上曾经一度出现过的音乐上的形式主义和由此影响到的表演上的自然主义倾向也被批判了。苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院，就这样在正确方针和正确艺术创作原则的指导下，健康地发展了优秀的俄罗斯歌剧、舞剧艺术传统，创造了一个光辉的苏维埃歌剧、舞剧学派。
    从歌剧的第一场开始，通过二重唱和四重唱，便把女地主拉林娜一家人物的性格完全介绍了出来。在短短的篇章里，四个剧中人各自唱着自己的心思：拉林娜和乳母回忆着一去不来的往日和青春，沉思而端庄的妲姬雅娜和天真任性的奥耳迦的性格形成了很动人的对比。
    接着的一场中，合唱队没有出场，应该说是非常聪明的处理。据说斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基是由于首次演出的舞台太小才作如此处理的。但是，我们看来，农民的合唱队不出场，避免了原来脚本上农民和女地主见面的难堪的场面，使这一场更富有诗的境界。应该感谢剧院的卓越的合唱指挥和出色的合唱团，他们虽没有在台上露面，但却创造了动人的音乐形象，成功地表演了农民的合唱和舞蹈这一场优美的音乐。
    奥耳迦的小咏叹调这一场和紧接着的另一场面，更深一步地对妲姬雅娜和奥耳迦的性格作了描写。妲姬雅娜说：
      “随着歌声，
        我幻想着远方。”而奥耳迦说：
      “你总在幻想，
        而歌声给我的只有欢畅。”就这样，在舞台上展示了两个不同的人物性格。
    四重唱和以后的几场介绍了两位男主角，大城市来的奥涅金惊奇于这位女地主的田庄的田园情调，但同时又显得那么淡漠。连斯基便表现的完全相反，向奥耳迦表示爱情的那一场，充分表现了他的热情而激动的性格。
    第一幕的第二景，在妲姬雅娜和乳母的对话中，乳母叙述着她自己的旧式婚姻生活的情景；而妲姬雅娜，这个陷入爱情中的少女，表现了极度的焦灼和不安；动人的音乐形象和动人的表演，使人好像预感到悲剧的开始。紧接着就是著名的写信的一场，在这个长长的抒情调中，深刻地描写了在爱情中被煎熬的少女的复杂心理，羞怯、恐惧、期望、焦虑。演员斯米尔诺娃成功地刻划了人物，她的每一个动作和手势都有明确的目的，歌声中有着饱满的情感。
    第三景以欢乐的女声合唱开始，为妲姬雅娜不幸的爱情遭遇作出对比和预兆。合唱队的演员没有登场，这使非必要的人物尽少出现，赋与这个抒情歌剧以更完美的风格。在奥涅金的抒情调的一场，演员沙宾柯作了精彩的表演，他用矜持而冷淡的腔调拒绝了妲姬雅娜的爱情，并且说：
      “倘使我愿意把一生，
      拴在烦琐的家庭；
      倘使我有如此的好运，
      能够做丈夫和父亲；
      那么，的确，可能除了你，
      我不会另有所寻。…………
      但是，请相信，
      夫妇生活对我们将是苦行，
      日子久了，爱情就将无法追寻。”演员左眼的眉毛时常向上挑起来，把奥涅金那种自尊而淡漠的情感，表演的非常突出而动人。合唱队的声音又出现了，他们的欢乐的声音，把妲姬雅娜被伤害的情绪更深刻地烘托了出来。应该说，这是伟大的作曲家的匠心的安排。
    第二幕的第一景，可以说是当时俄罗斯的外省的地主们的社会生活的写照，音乐剧院的处理，使这一幅风俗画更加动人。这里有趾高气扬的小军官，也有那些哓舌的老妇人，特别是那法籍清客特里凯，他唱的那首纯粹“沙龙风”的献诗“美丽的妲姬雅娜”，可以说是对那种装腔作势、忸怩作态的当时的时尚乐风的尖刻的讽刺。那些吃饱饭没事干的老妇人们，在议论着这个，议论着那个。就这样，激起了奥涅金向奥耳迦表示殷勤的恶作剧的念头，使容易冲动的连斯基妒火中烧，以致要向奥涅金提起决斗的要求。欢乐的宴会，变成了不快的场面。在这里，作曲家和演出者又那么真实地刻划了奥涅金性格中懦弱的一面。
    决斗的场面，是感人最深的一场，在这里，音乐剧院的艺术家卢申，把这场布景装置的极为完美。是一个冬天的清晨，而在整个色彩的调子上，已经暗示了悲剧的来临。
    在这里必须提起，这部歌剧的舞台装置，可以说是典型的范例之一。用八根希腊式的圆柱，作为除了决斗一场以外的各场布景的基础，这就使全剧的布景具有一种统一而和谐的调子，而且显得那么经济与合理。
    决斗的一场，有连斯基的著名的抒情调，演员那沙耶夫斯基用充满了感情的声音，回忆着过去，想望着目前。这一首抒情调，可以说是连斯基的性格在音乐形象上的完美的描写。决斗开始了，连斯基被打死了，奥涅金的那副惊恐的表情，好像他自己也不晓得他做了些什么。
    第三幕是豪华的格列明侯爵的府第，奥涅金从外国归来，当他知道了侯爵夫人是妲姬雅娜时，他显得是那样茫然。而侯爵的安静的抒情调显示出满足和幸福，演员杜德列夫用柔美的低音歌唱了这首音乐。最后一个低G音，歌词是：“幸福”这个字，独唱家用那么平静的声音，完美地表达了歌词的意义。
    接着是奥涅金的抒情调。现在已经是贵妇人的那个沉思的外省少女使他唤起了自己拒绝过的爱情。最后一场，妲姬雅娜拒绝了这个再也没有半点骄傲的奥涅金的爱情。这个一事无成的“多余的人”，连自己曾经拒绝过的爱情也都不能得到了。歌剧的最后，在舞台上是绝望的奥涅金，用那么激动的声音，连他被迫接受决斗时都没有那么激动的声音，高喊着：
      “耻辱，痛心，
      啊！我的绝望的命运！”好像这一次真的激动了他的心灵。
    俄罗斯的伟大的古典大师们，把歌剧和舞剧音乐，发展到如此辉煌灿烂，这主要是因为从普希金以来，俄国的贵族进步知识分子和平民知识分子，在文学艺术的各个领域中，进行着爱国启蒙运动和民主主义的活动。并且这些活动日益增涨，越来越有更广泛的基础和范围。因而在音乐艺术上也产生了像格林卡、莫索尔斯基、柴可夫斯基、李姆斯基—柯萨可夫等大师们。在音乐艺术的各个领域，也都达到了惊人的成就。如果说伟大的普希金企图用长诗这一形式来描写社会生活的主题，那么，格林卡和莫索尔斯基便是开始用歌剧这一形式描写了人民的英雄和人民是历史创造者这一主题的作曲家。而除了歌剧中史诗型的歌剧外，柴可夫斯基可以说是奠立了抒情歌剧的最初的基础和典范的大师。
    莫斯科音乐剧院在伟大的戏剧大师斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基亲自指导之下，对于这个精美的歌剧作了不可逾越的舞台处理。这个歌剧演出已经一千多次了，而在今天我们看起来，仍然具有着浓郁的芳香。（附图片）
    歌剧“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”的第一幕第三场，奥涅金以冷酷的申斥回答了妲姬雅娜对他的纯真的爱情的表白。
