All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Telegram to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions

To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

    On the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, I, on behalf of the Chinese working people, extend our heartfelt congratulations to you and, through you, to the Soviet workers and people who are advancing confidently towards the victory of communism.

    The Chinese working people are watching with great excitement the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet working people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle to build communism and safeguard world peace. The glorious achievements of the Soviet people in the struggle for the construction of communism and the safeguarding of world peace have greatly encouraged the confidence and courage of the Chinese and the people of the world in their struggle for a better life for mankind, and have strengthened the forces of the peace camp.

    The Chinese workers and all the people will never forget the tremendous and generous assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people, and express our heartfelt gratitude for this assistance. Recently, the joint communiques of the Sino-Soviet talks and the Soviet people's gift to the Chinese people of the machinery and equipment necessary to organize a state-owned grain farm with 20,000 hectares of sowing area are signs of a new development in the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people highly cherish this friendship and assistance from the Soviet government and people, which plays a significant role in enabling our country to gradually transition to a socialist society, and also plays a significant role in safeguarding Asian and world peace.

    Long live the heroic Soviet working class and its glorious trade unions!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    All-China Federation of Trade Unions, October 30, 1954

    全国总工会致全苏工会中央理事会电全苏工会中央理事会：
    欣逢伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年，谨代表中国劳动人民向你们并通过你们向正在满怀信心地向共产主义胜利前进的苏联工人和人民致以衷心的祝贺。
      中国劳动人民以极其兴奋的心情，时刻注视着苏联劳动人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在从事共产主义建设和维护世界和平事业的斗争中，所获得的光辉灿烂的成就。苏联人民在为建设共产主义和维护世界和平的斗争中的辉煌成就极大地鼓舞着中国和全世界人民为争取人类美好生活的斗争信心和勇气，并壮大了和平阵营的力量。
      中国工人和全体人民永远不会忘记苏联政府和人民给予我国的巨大的慷慨的援助，并对这种援助表示衷心的感谢。最近，中苏会谈的各项联合公报和苏联人民赠给中国人民以组织拥有两万公顷播种面积的国营谷物农场所必需的机器和设备，是中苏两国之间伟大友谊的新发展的标志。中国人民非常珍视苏联政府和人民对我们这种友谊和援助，这对于使我国逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，起着重大的作用；对于保卫亚洲和世界和平，也起着重大的作用。
    英勇的苏联工人阶级及其光荣的工会万岁！
    中苏两国人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中华全国总工会　一九五四年十月三十日
