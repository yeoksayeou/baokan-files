Light Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry Exceeds October Production Plan
[Our Newspaper] The Light Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has exceeded its October national production plan. The bureau completed 117.11% of its October total output value plan and 119.15% of its labor productivity plan. The completion of product output was very good, with most products meeting or exceeding their planned targets. Among them, vegetable oil completed 109.43% of the monthly plan, solid soap completed 106.89% of the monthly plan, canned goods completed 113.88% of the monthly plan, milk substitute powder completed 140.97% of the monthly plan, and milk powder completed 130.11% of the monthly plan.

The reasons for the over-fulfillment of production plans for various products, in the case of vegetable oil, were mainly due to the fact that factories increased oil extraction rates, reduced residual oil rates in oil cakes, and reduced machine accidents, thereby increasing operating time. For example, the Shanghai Oil & Fat Factory No. 1 increased the oil extraction rate of rapeseed from 37.3% in September to 38.89% in October. The residual oil rate in rapeseed dry cakes was generally around 6.27% to 6.31% (reaching a minimum of 6.13%), which was lower than the lowest rate of 6.68% in September. The oil extraction rate of rice bran oil at the Shanghai Oil & Fat Factory No. 2 also increased from 11.33% in September to 12.1% in October.

There have also been improvements in product quality. For example, the quality of Umbrella brand soap was poor in the past. Recently, due to the preliminary adoption of physical testing methods for soap, the establishment of interim quality standards and formula management systems, and the revision of operating procedures, as well as the strengthening of semi-finished and finished product inspection, product quality has improved. Shortcomings such as softening and disintegration have been preliminarily overcome, and shrinkage has also improved. After insulation testing, the vast majority of thick-broth pork canned goods meet the standards.

    轻工业管理局超额完成十月份生产计划
    【本报讯】轻工业部轻工业管理局超额完成了十月份国家生产计划。全局完成十月份总产值计划百分之一百一十七点一一，完成劳动生产率计划百分之一百一十九点一五。在产品产量方面，完成的情况非常良好，大多数产品都完成和超额完成了计划。其中植物油完成了月计划的百分之一百零九点四三，固体肥皂完成了月计划的百分之一百零六点八九，罐头完成了月计划的百分之一百一十三点八八，代乳粉完成了月计划的百分之一百四十点九七，奶粉完成了月计划的百分之一百三十点一一。
    各种产品产量能超额完成计划的原因，在植物油方面，主要是由于各厂提高了产油率，降低了饼中残油率，以及减少了机器事故，增加了作业时间。如上海油脂一厂，菜籽产油率由九月份的百分之三十七点三，提高到十月份的百分之三十八点八九，菜籽干饼中残油率一般在百分之六点二七至六点三一左右（最低达到百分之六点一三），比九月份最低的百分之六点六八还要低。上海油脂二厂米糠油的产油率，也由九月份的百分之十一点三三，提高到十月份的百分之十二点一。
    在产品质量方面也有了提高。如伞牌肥皂过去质量不好，最近由于初步采取了肥皂的物理性检验方法，订出了暂行合格标准和配方管理制度，修订了操作规程，加强了半成品及成品检验工作等，使产品质量有了提高，软烂等缺点已初步克服，收缩情况也好转。浓汁猪肉罐头经保温检验，绝大部分都合标准。
