    To all employees of cotton purchasing stations and cotton ginning factories in Beijing:
    Pay Attention to Eliminating Overwintering Cotton Bollworms in Cotton Warehouses
    Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, cotton purchasing stations and cotton ginning factories in Beijing are actively carrying out work to prevent and control overwintering cotton bollworms. In the past, stations and factories achieved good results by spraying 5% DDT solution and other pesticides in cotton storage warehouses to eliminate overwintering cotton bollworms. In order to better kill the overwintering cotton bollworms, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives made arrangements to the purchasing stations and ginning factories before the cotton harvest this year, and the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry also issued promotional materials. After studying, the employees of all stations and factories generally recognized the importance of preventing and controlling overwintering cotton bollworms and actively carried out this work. Before the cotton harvest, each station and factory began spraying the walls and ceilings of the cotton storage warehouses with pesticides. By the end of October, all of the city's more than sixty cotton storage warehouses and two ginning workshops had been sprayed twice, and some warehouses had been sprayed up to three times. To further kill the cotton bollworms, each station and factory plans to spray again once or twice in the near future to completely eliminate the cotton bollworms. (Yao Yong)

    北京市各棉花收购站和轧花厂职工
    注意消灭棉花仓库中的越冬棉花红铃虫
    北京市各棉花收购站和轧花厂在市农林局和供销合作总社领导下，积极开展防治越冬棉花红铃虫工作。过去各站、厂在存花仓库喷射百分之五滴滴涕液等药水，消灭越冬棉花红铃虫，效果很好。为了更好的药杀越冬棉花红铃虫，北京市供销合作总社在今年收花前即向收花站、轧花厂作了布置，市农林局也印发了宣传材料。各站、厂经过学习后，职工们普遍认识到防治越冬棉花红铃虫重要性，积极开展防治越冬棉花红铃虫工作。在收花前各站、厂即开始往存花仓库的墙壁及顶棚上喷药，到十月底全市六十多个存花仓库，和两个轧花车间都喷药两次，个别的仓库喷药到三次。为了进一步药杀红铃虫，各站、厂计划在短期内再喷药一、二次，以彻底消灭红铃虫。   （姚雍）
