    Thanks to the Soviet Union for Helping China Establish Large-Scale Grain Farms
    Liu Peizhi, Director of the State-Owned Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture

    From the very beginning of China's construction of the first batch of state-owned farms, the Soviet government and the Soviet people, with their lofty internationalist spirit and great fraternal friendship, have provided us with all kinds of first-class, latest-style, and modern tractors, agricultural machinery, as well as grain and livestock breeds, and other material and technical assistance; and have selected experienced experts to come to China to help and guide the construction and production work of state-owned farms. It is precisely because of this unparalleled deep friendship and warm care and assistance that our state-owned farms have achieved considerable development in just a few years.

    Now China already has more than one hundred state-owned mechanized farms of various types, fully equipped with modern technology. These farms, due to the widespread adoption of the Soviet Union's advanced agricultural science and technology experience, have begun to show the advantages of large-scale mechanized production; after two years of rectification and improvement, they have basically reversed the situation of low yields, high costs, large waste, and unprofitable operations during the trial period. This batch of farms has accumulated experience and trained cadres for China's further development of the state-owned farm cause in the future, and at the same time has provided a good demonstration for the farmers who are moving towards the road of cooperation in China.

    Just as the Chinese people are gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, and demanding a corresponding development of agricultural production to meet the needs of the country's increasingly developing economic construction, the Soviet government delegation, representing the will of the Soviet people, has again donated a large number of the latest and most diverse agricultural machines to our country, and has selected dozens of experts to help China establish a large-scale grain farm with 300,000 mu of land. How touching is this generous and selfless fraternal assistance from the Soviet people!

    Based on the scientific theories of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people created state-owned farms in the form of large-scale socialist economy, and accumulated rich experience in managing this socialist agricultural enterprise. This valuable experience has a deeper and more vivid meaning for the Chinese people, especially for our state-owned farm workers. After the completion of this large-scale grain farm, it will not only help our existing state-owned farms to further improve their production technology level and management level, but also become the most complete school for us to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In this highly mechanized university, we will systematically learn the experience of establishing and managing such mechanized state-owned farms and organizing large-scale land reclamation, which will have immeasurable significance and effect on the future development of China's agriculture, especially the state-owned farm cause.

    In order to systematically and purposefully learn from the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in establishing large-scale grain farms, we have transferred a large number of administrative leading cadres and technical cadres from existing state-owned farms, military reclamation farms, agricultural colleges, and other regions and relevant departments to work and study with Soviet experts at the farm. In the process of construction and production, we will also continuously organize visits and learning, and widely and deeply publicize and promote the comprehensive and systematic experience of this farm from surveying and design to construction and production, so that the Soviet Union's advanced agricultural technology, especially the experience of reclaiming virgin land and developing state-owned farms on cultivated land, can help improve and develop China's agricultural production under possible conditions.

    The address of this large-scale state-owned grain farm has been selected in the area east of Jiamusi in Northeast China. It is the central area of large and concentrated state-owned wasteland, with fertile soil and flat terrain, which is a good place for large-scale mechanized production. At present, the site survey, land division design, and material preparation are underway, and cadres will be trained in categories during the winter. It is expected that large-scale land reclamation production and basic construction work can be launched next year.

    We Chinese people sincerely thank you for this great friendship. The personnel we have sent to work at the farm will accept this glorious and arduous task with great enthusiasm, and are determined to learn the experience of building farms and organizing large-scale land reclamation in a short period of time with the help of Soviet experts, and to repay the help and care of the Soviet people with practical actions.

    感谢苏联帮助我国建立大型谷物农场
    农业部国营农场管理局局长　刘培植
    从我国建设第一批国营农场的时候起，苏联政府和苏联人民就以崇高的国际主义精神和伟大的兄弟般的友谊，给我们各种头等的、最新式的、现代化的拖拉机、农机具以及谷物、牲畜良种等物质的和技术的援助；并选派了经验丰富的专家来我国帮助和指导国营农场的建场和生产工作。正因为有了这些无比深厚的友谊和热情的关怀和帮助，使我们的国营农场在短短几年中获得了相当的发展。
    现在我国已经有了完全用现代化技术装备起来的、各种类型的国营机械农场一百多个。这些农场由于广泛地采用了苏联先进的农业科学技术经验，已开始显示出大规模机械化生产的优越性；经过两年来的整顿和改进，基本上扭转了试办时期的产量低、成本高、浪费大、经营无利的局面。这批农场已为我国今后进一步发展国营农场事业积累了经验，培养了干部，同时又给我国正向合作化道路前进的农民作了良好的示范。
    正当我国人民为逐步实现国家社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造，要求相应地发展农业生产以适应国家经济建设日益发展的需要的时候，苏联政府代表团代表苏联人民的心意，又赠给我国大批最新的各式各样的农业机器，并选派数十位专家来帮助我国建立一个拥有三十万亩地的大型谷物农场。苏联人民这一慷慨无私的兄弟般的帮助，是何等的令人感动啊！
    苏联人民根据列宁、斯大林的科学理论，创建了大规模的社会主义经济形式的国营农场，并积累了丰富的管理这一社会主义农业企业的经验。这些宝贵的经验，对我国人民，特别是对我们国营农场工作者来说，有着更深长更生动的意义。这座大型谷物农场建成后，不仅可以帮助我们现有的国营农场进一步提高生产技术水平和经营管理水平，而且将成为我们学习苏联先进经验的一所最完整的学校。在这所高度机械化的大学校里，我们将会系统地学到建立和管理这样机械化国营农场和组织大规模开荒的经验，这对于今后我国农业特别是国营农场事业的发展，将有不可估量的意义和作用。
    为了有组织地、有计划地学习苏联建立大型谷物农场的宝贵经验，我们已从现有国营农场、军垦农场、农业院校以及其他地区和有关部门抽调大批行政领导骨干和技术干部，前往该场跟随苏联专家一同工作和学习。在建场生产过程中还将不断地组织参观和学习，并要广泛深入地宣传和推广这个农场从勘测设计直到建场生产的全面系统的经验，使苏联的先进农业技术特别是开垦生荒地和熟荒地建设国营农场的经验，在可能的条件下，能有助于我国农业生产的提高和发展。
    这个大型国营谷物农场的地址已选定在东北佳木斯以东地区。那里是大片的集中的国有荒地的中心地区，土地肥沃，地势平坦，是适于大规模机械化生产的好地方。目前场址勘测、土地区划设计和筹划备料等工作正在开始进行，并将利用冬季分类训练干部。预计明年大规模的开荒生产和基本建设工作即可展开。
    我们中国人民衷心感谢这种伟大的友谊。我们抽派去该场工作的人员，都将以极大的热情接受这个光荣而艰巨的任务，决心在苏联专家的帮助下，在短时间内学会建设农场和组织大规模开荒的经验，以实际行动来答谢苏联人民的帮助和关怀。
