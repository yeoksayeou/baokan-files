Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 19th: All Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops in Laos completely withdrew from Lao territory on the night of November 16th.

　　The Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops, who had gathered in five temporary garrison areas after the ceasefire, began their withdrawal at the end of September according to the routes stipulated in the Lao Joint Ceasefire Commission agreement. Among them, the Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops gathered in the Meng Mai area of ​​Attopeu Province in southern Laos began to withdraw in batches on September 30th, passed through the temporary garrison areas in central Laos, and arrived in Ha Tinh Province in central Vietnam on November 16th; the volunteer troops gathered in the Doulakhom area of ​​Vientiane Province in northern Laos withdrew in two batches on October 3rd and 5th, and returned to Nghe An Province in central Vietnam on November 6th; the volunteer troops gathered in Phongsaly, Ou Tai, and Muang Huar areas in northern Laos withdrew on November 13th and arrived in Lai Chau Province in northwestern Vietnam three days later; the volunteer troops gathered in Muang Liet and Su Hao areas of ​​Xieng Khouang Province in northern Laos withdrew on November 14th and arrived in Thanh Hoa Province in central Vietnam on November 16th; and the volunteer troops gathered in Seno and Boualapha areas in central Laos also withdrew on November 14th and arrived in Ha Tinh Province in central Vietnam on the night of November 16th. So far, all Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops in Laos have withdrawn to Vietnam, three days ahead of the time stipulated in the agreement.

　　The Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops withdrew during the rainy season in Laos. Soldiers often had to climb mountains and cross rivers in heavy rain, or step through knee-deep mud while holding hands. When traveling through uninhabited mountain forests, they ate wild bamboo shoots when their food ran out, and sometimes they had nothing to eat and had to go hungry. In addition, they had to overcome various obstructions and provocations from the French Federal Forces and the Lao Royal Forces along the way. Even under such difficult circumstances, the Vietnamese People's Volunteer Troops persisted day and night. Finally, they completed the withdrawal within the prescribed time limit and fulfilled the ceasefire agreement.

　　Although the French side tried its best to isolate the volunteer troops from the Lao people, always arranging their marching routes in the most remote wilderness, whenever they passed through a slightly populated area, men, women, old and young from far and near would automatically come to see them off, some even carrying freshly cut sugar cane. An elderly woman on the Bolaven Plateau hugged a Vietnamese volunteer soldier tightly, and said with tears in her eyes: You are leaving, but I will always remember who accompanied me to cultivate the land and fertilize it, and who taught my children to read and write. People came to say goodbye to the Vietnamese volunteer troops, repeatedly urging them to send their regards to President Ho Chi Minh and Vietnamese friends. Many old people and women even tied silk threads on the wrists of the soldiers to bless them, according to the Lao people's custom of seeing off their closest relatives.

    越南人民志愿部队全部撤出老挝国境
    【新华社河内十九日电】在老挝的越南人民志愿部队已于十一月十六日夜间全部撤离老挝国境。
    停战后集合在五个临时驻扎地段的越南人民志愿部队，是按照老挝联合停战委员会协议规定的路线从九月底开始撤退的。其中集合在老挝南部阿速坡省孟梅地区的越南人民志愿部队，九月三十日开始分批撤离，经过老挝中部的临时驻扎地段，十一月十六日全部到达越南中部的河静省；集合在老挝北部万象省都拉贡地区的志愿部队，十月三日、五日分两批撤离，十一月六日回到越南中部的义安省；集合在老挝北部丰沙里、乌西、蒙瓦地区的志愿部队十一月十三日撤离，三天后到达越南西北的莱州省；集合在老挝北部桑怒省孟烈、苏好地区的志愿部队十一月十四日撤离，十一月十六日到达越南中部清化省；集合在老挝中部塞诺、布亚拉发的志愿部队也在十一月十四日撤离，十一月十六日夜间到达越南中部的河静省。至此，在老挝的越南人民志愿部队已全部撤回越南，他们撤离老挝比协议规定的时间提早了三天。
    越南人民志愿部队在撤退时正值老挝雨季，战士们常常不得不冒着大雨翻山越岭、游泳过河或手牵手地一步步迈过深及膝盖以上的泥浆。行经荒无人烟的山林地带时，带的粮食吃完了就挖野笋吃，甚至什么吃的东西都没有，只好饿肚子。此外，他们一路上还不得不排除法兰西联邦部队和老挝王国部队的种种阻挠和挑衅行为。就是在这样困难的情况下，越南人民志愿部队夜以继日地坚持行进。终于在规定期限以内完成了撤退，履行了停战协定。
    尽管法方竭力使志愿部队和老挝人民隔离，总是把他们的行军路线安排在最偏僻的荒山野地里，但是每当他们路过有一点人烟的地方，远近的男女老少都自动跑来送行，有的还扛来刚刚砍下的甘蔗。波罗芬高原上一位上了年纪的老婆婆紧紧地抱着越南志愿战士，流着眼泪说：你们走了，但是我永远记得是谁曾陪我一块种地上肥，是谁教会我的儿女们看书识字。人们都来向越南志愿部队道别，一再叮嘱他们代向胡志明主席和越南朋友们问好。很多老人和妇女并且按照老挝人民在给最亲近的人送行时才用的仪式，把丝线拴在战士们的手腕上为他们祝福。
