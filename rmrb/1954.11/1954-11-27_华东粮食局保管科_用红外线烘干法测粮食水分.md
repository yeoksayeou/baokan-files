Huadong Grain Bureau Storage Section
Using Infrared Drying Method to Measure Grain Moisture

    The Huadong Grain Bureau has successfully tested the use of infrared drying method to measure grain moisture, providing an important method for shortening the time required to measure grain moisture.
    Measuring grain moisture is an important task for grain storage departments. Currently, there are two methods commonly used to measure grain moisture: one is using an electric oven, which is very time-consuming, requiring at least six to eight hours to measure one grain sample; the other is using an oil distillation moisture meter, which also takes more than forty minutes per measurement. In order to measure grain moisture more quickly, the cadres of the technical group of the Huadong Grain Bureau Storage Section drew on the Soviet experience of using infrared drying method to measure soil moisture and conducted experiments on using infrared drying method to measure grain moisture. After more than two months of experimentation, they finally succeeded.
    The application of the infrared drying method to measure grain moisture utilizes the thermal effect of infrared rays to rapidly increase the temperature of the grain sample, causing the moisture to evaporate in a relatively short period of time, achieving the purpose of drying. Using the infrared drying method to measure grain moisture can greatly shorten the time required. According to the experiments of the technical group of the Huadong Grain Bureau Storage Section, applying this method to measure grain moisture takes only seven to ten minutes per sample, and the measurement results do not differ much from those obtained using the electric oven drying method.
    The infrared moisture meter has a simple structure, and its cost is cheaper than both electric ovens and oil distillation moisture meters. It also saves more electricity than electric ovens and oil distillation moisture meters. The operation method is also very simple, and this type of meter can be used wherever there is electrical equipment. (Tao Mingpan)

    华东粮食局保管科
    用红外线烘干法测粮食水分
    华东粮食局用红外线烘干法测定粮食水分，已经试验成功，为缩短测定粮食水分的时间提供了一个重要的方法。
    测定粮食水分，是粮食仓储部门的一项重要工作。现在各地普遍应用的测定粮食水分的方法有两种：一种是用电烘箱，这个方法很费时间，每测定一个粮食样品至少需要六小时到八小时；另一种是用油蒸水分测定器，每测定一次也要用四十多分钟。为了能更快地测定粮食水分，华东粮食局保管科技术组的干部吸取苏联以红外线烘干法测定土壤水分的经验，进行了用红外线烘干法测定粮食水分的试验。经过两个多月的试验，终于成功。
    应用红外线烘干法测定粮食水分，是利用红外线的热效应使粮食样品的温度迅速升高，在较短的时间内使水分蒸发，达到干燥的目的。用红外线烘干法测定粮食水分，时间可以大大缩短。根据华东粮食局保管科技术组的试验，应用这个方法来测定粮食水分，每测定一个样品只需要七分到十分钟，而且测定的结果同用电烘箱烘干法没有多大的差异。
    红外线水分测定器构造简单，造价比电烘箱和油蒸水分测定器都便宜，用电也比电烘箱和油蒸水分测定器节省；操作方法也很简易，有电力设备的地方都可应用这种测定器。　　（陶铭盘）
