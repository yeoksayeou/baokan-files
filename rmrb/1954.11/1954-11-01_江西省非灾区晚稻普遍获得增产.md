Late Rice in Non-Disaster Areas of Jiangxi Province Generally Achieves Increased Production

The autumn harvest in Jiangxi Province has concluded. This year, except for disaster areas, late rice generally saw increased production across the province. The highest yield reached 500 jin per mu, generally over 300 jin, and the lowest was 250 jin, an increase of 50-60 jin per mu compared to last year's late rice yield. In Fuzhou Special District, the more than 120,000 mu of late rice already harvested in nine counties all saw increased production compared to last year. According to a survey of late rice yields in five townships of Nancheng County, the average yield increased by 15% compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams had even higher yields. The Daben Agricultural Production Cooperative in Penzhu Township, Suichuan County, Ji'an Special District, has overfulfilled its plan for a 27% increase in production this year. The late rice harvested by Xu Chunlan's mutual aid team in Heqiao Township, Ninggang County, from 3.2 mu of land yielded 1,950 jin of rice, an increase of 33% compared to last year. The late rice of nine peasant households in Tangli Village, Ninth District, Yongxin County, yielded 3,868 jin, an increase of 1,923 jin over the original plan.

The achievement of high yields is mainly due to the broad masses of peasants actively responding to the call of the Party and the People's Government to carry out excess production increase. Since the province-wide campaign for increased production and thrift and disaster relief production was launched in the summer, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to participate in mutual aid and cooperation to improve production has been further heightened. They have generally changed their previous crude cultivation habits for late rice, and have earnestly achieved intensive cultivation and increased fertilization.

Currently, peasants in various localities are planning to sell their surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction and purchase means of production, in order to prepare conditions for next year's production. (Our Jiangxi Reporter Station)

    江西省非灾区晚稻普遍获得增产
    江西省各地秋收工作已经结束。今年全省除灾区外，晚稻普遍增产。最高产量每亩达五百斤，一般三百多斤，最低二百五十斤，较去年晚稻产量每亩增加五、六十斤。抚州专区九个县已收割的十二万多亩晚稻，都比去年增产。据调查南城县五个乡晚稻产量，平均比去年增产百分之十五。农业生产合作社、互助组的产量更高。吉安专区遂川县盆珠乡大盆农业生产合作社今年增产百分之二十七的计划已超额完成。宁冈县河桥乡徐春兰互助组收割的三亩二分田晚稻，收谷一千九百五十斤，较去年增产百分之三十三。永新县九区塘里村九户农民的晚稻，比原计划增产一千九百二十三斤，现收到三千八百六十八斤。
    丰产成绩的获得，主要是广大农民积极响应了党和人民政府开展超额增产的号召。自从夏季全省开展增产节约生产救灾运动以来，广大农民参加互助合作搞好生产的积极性进一步高涨，普遍改变了以往对晚稻粗放的栽培习惯，认真做到了精耕细作，加工加肥。
    现在，各地农民正计划把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设，购买生产资料，为明年生产准备条件。  （本报江西记者站）
