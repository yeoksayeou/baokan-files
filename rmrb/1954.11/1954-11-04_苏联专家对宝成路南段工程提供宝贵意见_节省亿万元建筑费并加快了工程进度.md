Soviet experts provided valuable advanced technology and experience in the design and construction of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. As a result, hundreds of millions of yuan in construction costs were saved, and the project's progress was accelerated.

As early as when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began construction, Soviet experts came to Chengdu. They carefully studied the design documents of the line and put forward many valuable suggestions. Chinese veteran engineers Lan Tian, Guo Yi, and others, based on the advice of Soviet experts, repeatedly studied the characteristics and relevant data of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, made careful calculations, shortened the line by more than 30 kilometers, and reduced more than a dozen large projects, saving the country 1.2 trillion yuan in wealth. Soviet line experts, after in-depth study of the specific conditions of the line, suggested using short slopes for the line's gradient. In this way, on the 118-kilometer line from Chengdu to Mianyang alone, more than 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork and stonework were reduced, saving 1 billion yuan in construction costs.

During the construction process, Soviet experts, regardless of the severe winter cold and summer heat, often went deep into the construction site to check and solve difficulties in construction. The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has crisscrossing rivers and dense streams, and more than 1,300 bridges and culverts need to be built along the entire section, making the project very arduous. However, at the beginning of the construction, the efficiency was not high due to the unreasonable organization of the labor force and the chaotic construction sequence. After on-site investigation, Soviet experts suggested adopting a flow-line operation method in the construction of bridges and culverts. As a result, the efficiency of the main masonry project in bridge and culvert construction increased by 50% to 100%. When building bridges and culverts, the Soviet "sectional masonry method for bridges and culverts" was also promoted, overcoming the phenomenon of cracks in the arch rings of culverts caused by improper design. In the earthwork and stonework projects along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway north of Mianyang, the traditional method of manually drilling holes and blasting mountains was inefficient. After Soviet experts suggested promoting the "large-scale blasting method," the project's progress was greatly accelerated. A team in the 28th Work Zone of the 8th Engineering Section used the large-scale blasting method and blasted 11,000 cubic meters of hard rock in one shot on October 15, saving 300 kilograms of explosives and increasing work efficiency by 14.6 times.

Soviet experts paid special attention to careful calculation and increased production and conservation in construction projects, to achieve the goals of being good, economical, fast, and safe. Once, a Soviet expert discovered that the soil excavated during the construction of bridge piers was being thrown away at will. He immediately suggested that this soil should be used as much as possible for dam filling or approach bridges. The experts often said to Chinese engineering and technical personnel: "Every grain of sand and every stone is the wealth of the motherland!" In the mountainous areas north of Guangyuan, transportation and supply conditions were very difficult. Soviet experts suggested making full use of traffic routes and various effective means of transportation to shorten the transportation mileage. According to this suggestion, a 63-kilometer-long transportation access road was added between Mian County and Lueyang, shortening the material transportation mileage by 318 kilometers. Utilizing the roadbed access road and small steel rail access road instead of the automobile access road in the Lueyang to Huangsha River section, and utilizing the gradually extended train transportation and Jialing River shipping between Chengdu and Lueyang, it is initially estimated that transportation costs can be saved by 30.3 billion yuan.

    苏联专家对宝成路南段工程提供宝贵意见
    节省亿万元建筑费并加快了工程进度
    在修筑宝成铁路南段的设计和施工过程中，苏联专家提供了许多有价值的先进技术和经验。因而，节省了亿万元建筑费，并加快了工程进度。
    早在宝成铁路开工时，苏联专家就来到了成都。他们仔细研究了这条线路的设计文件，提出了不少宝贵意见。我国老工程师蓝田、郭彝等根据苏联专家的意见，反复研究了宝成路的特点和有关资料，精打细算，缩短线路三十多公里，减少了十几处大工程，为国家节约了一万二千亿元的财富。苏联线路专家深入研究了线路的具体情况后，建议把线路坡度改用短坡，这样仅成都到绵阳一百一十八公里线路上，就减少了十三万多土石方工程，节省建筑费用十亿元。
    在施工过程中，苏联专家们不顾冬日严寒和夏季酷暑，经常深入工地检查和解决施工中的困难问题。宝成铁路南段沿线河渠纵横，溪流密布，全段要修建桥涵一千三百多座，工程很艰巨；但在开始施工时，由于劳动力组织不够合理，工序紊乱，效率不高。苏联专家在实地考察后，建议在桥涵施工中采用流水作业法。结果，仅桥涵施工最主要的安砌工程的效率就提高了百分之五十到一百。在修建桥涵时，还推行了苏联“桥涵分节安砌法”，克服了因设计不当引起的涵渠拱圈发生裂纹的现象。宝成铁路绵阳以北沿线的土石方工程中，过去用人工打眼放炮开山，效率很低。苏联专家建议推行“大量爆破法”后，大大加速了工程进度。第八工程段二十八工区的一个小组采用大量爆破法，在十月十五日一炮炸掉坚石一万一千方，节省三百公斤炸药，提高工作效率十四点六倍。
    苏联专家特别关心在建筑工程中精打细算，增产节约，达到好、省、快、安全的目的。有一次，一位苏联专家发现修桥台墩时挖出的泥土被随意抛掷，他立刻建议尽量把这些泥土利用到水坝填方或引桥等地。专家们常对我国工程技术人员说：“一沙一石都是祖国的财富！”在广元以北山区，运输供应条件很困难。苏联专家建议尽量利用通车路线和各种有效交通工具，缩短运输里程。根据这一建议，在沔县到略阳间增建了一条六十三公里长的运输便道，缩短了材料运输里程三百一十八公里。在略阳到黄沙河段利用路基便道和小钢轨便道代替汽车便道，又利用成都到略阳间逐渐延伸的火车运输和嘉陵江船运，初步计算可节约运输费三百零三亿元。　（新华社）
