The Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company – A Crystallization of Sino-Soviet Friendship

The Xinjiang Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company has achieved tremendous development and success in the four years since its establishment. The Soviet shares in this company, along with the Soviet shares in three other joint stock companies, will be completely transferred to our country starting January 1st of next year. By the end of this year, the company's oil extraction volume is expected to increase by more than 26 times compared to 1951, and gasoline production is expected to increase by 51.681 times compared to 1951. These achievements have played a positive role in the restoration and development of our country's economic undertakings.

The Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company has conducted large-scale geological exploration in the past four years. These are many oil wells and exploration wells erected around the mining area within dozens of kilometers. People's Pictorial Manuscript

Every Soviet expert actively helps Chinese workers master advanced production technology. This is the manager of the oil field, Soviet expert Golotov, learning about the production situation of oil wells from technician Turuganbieke (Uyghur). People's Pictorial Manuscript

In the past few years, many model workers have emerged from the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company. Bayakexi (Kazak), a mechanic from the oil field, used gas from crude oil to replace the oil pressure pump and improved the device of the oil pressure tank, saving two oil pumps and two workers. This is Bayakexi introducing the performance of this equipment to workers. People's Pictorial Manuscript

Drilling Team No. 89, led by special-class labor model Wang Bingcheng, created a national drilling record of 230 meters per day on June 24 this year. This is a picture of the workers of Drilling Team No. 89 discussing how to complete their production tasks ahead of schedule. People's Pictorial Manuscript

This pumping unit is drawing crude oil from thousands of meters underground and then transporting it to the refinery through pipelines. People's Pictorial Manuscript

A large-scale automated cracking refinery has officially been put into production. This is a corner of the refinery. Central News Documentary Film Studio Manuscript

    中苏石油股份公司——中苏友谊的结晶
    新疆中苏石油股份公司成立四年以来，获得了巨大的发展和成就。这个公司中的苏联股份将在明年一月一日起连同其他三个股份公司的苏联股份一起全部移交我国。这个公司的石油开采量到今年年底预计较一九五一年可提高二十六倍多，汽油的产量到今年年底预计较一九五一年可提高到五十一点六八一倍。这些成就对恢复和发展我国经济事业起了积极的作用。
    中苏石油股份公司成立四年来，进行了规模巨大的地质勘探。这是矗立在矿区周围几十公里以内的许多油井和探井。人民画报稿
    每一个苏联专家都积极帮助中国工人掌握先进的生产技术。这是油田处经理苏联专家果洛托夫向技师吐鲁干别克（维吾尔族）了解油井的生产情况。                    人民画报稿
    几年来，中苏石油股份公司涌现了不少的模范工作者。油田处机械师巴亚克西（哈萨克族）利用原油中的瓦斯气代替压油泵，改进了压油罐的装置，节省了两台油泵和两名工人。这是巴亚克西正在给工人介绍这种设备性能的情形。                       人民画报稿
    八十九号钻井队在特等劳动模范王炳诚领导下，今年六月二十四日创造了日进二百三十公尺的全国钻井最高纪录。这是八十九号钻井队的工人们正在讨论如何提前完成生产任务的情形。  人民画报稿
    这座抽油机正把原油从数千公尺的地层下汲取出来，然后经过输油管送到炼油厂去。  人民画报稿
    规模宏大的自动化裂化炼油厂已正式投入生产。这是炼油厂的一角。  中央新闻纪录电影制片厂稿
