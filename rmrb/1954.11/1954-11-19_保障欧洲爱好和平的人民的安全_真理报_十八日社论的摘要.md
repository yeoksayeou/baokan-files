Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 18th: “Pravda” published an editorial on the 18th entitled "Safeguarding the Security of Peace-Loving People in Europe."

The editorial first pointed out that the new peaceful steps taken by the Soviet government have aroused warm reactions. This clear proposal requires political figures of all countries to take a positive stand. Those who truly uphold peace and European security agree with and support the Soviet proposal, while the enemies of peace and European security resort to various cunning tricks and dishonorable conspiracies to reject this proposal.

The editorial pointed out that the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia have issued statements, and the governments of Romania and Bulgaria have replied to the Soviet Union, supporting the Soviet proposal to convene an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, and declaring their willingness to participate in this conference.

The editorial pointed out: All those who truly uphold peace and European security warmly welcome the Soviet proposal. Far-sighted politicians in France, Britain, West Germany, and other countries firmly pointed out that the all-European conference proposed by the Soviet government will provide an opportunity for all countries to consider the most important issues of concern to European public opinion. They emphasized that the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the arming of West Germany will not improve relations between European countries, but will make them more difficult, and only the enemies of Europe will be happy with this.

The editorial said: When the enemies of peace and European security have to publicly choose between guaranteeing European security or reviving German militarism, they have to openly state that they are unwilling to stand with the people of Europe against German revanchists, but are willing to stand with German revanchists who dream of launching new bloody marches to the East and West against the people of Europe. It is now clearer than ever that European security and the revival of German militarism are incompatible. Everyone should understand this indisputable truth.

The editorial said: The struggle against the revival of German militarism is not only a struggle for peace and European security, but also a struggle to safeguard the independence of the people of European countries. The Paris Agreements will not consolidate the position of Western European countries, as some figures in France and Britain have said; rather, they will subject their countries to German militarism.

The editorial said: The governments of Western European countries bear a great responsibility. They must show the world whether they are abandoning the dangerous policies they have adopted in London and Paris in favor of European collective security, or whether they will continue to adhere to these policies, reject the Soviet proposal, and not participate in the all-European conference. Their answer to this proposal will either open the road to genuine peaceful cooperation in Europe or exacerbate tensions, which will inevitably worsen relations between European countries and between some countries and others.

The editorial further pointed out that the justifications made by prominent figures in the United States, Britain, and France for their plans to rush to arm West Germany once again clearly showed that the spearhead of the Paris Agreements is aimed at the security of the peace-loving people of Europe. The people of Europe will draw the necessary conclusions from this.

The editorial, after pointing out the determination expressed by the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia to consider taking measures to ensure their national security, said: Peace-loving people of all countries will certainly agree to take measures to safeguard and strengthen security to deal with the revival of German militarism under the insistence of the American aggressive bloc.

The editorial said: The Soviet people have always actively fought for the consolidation of peace and international cooperation, and they firmly support the Soviet government's efforts to safeguard peace and European security. They believe that the people of other European countries will not stand idly by, but will participate in the life-and-death struggle between the defenders of European peace and security and those who revive German militarism. The future of Europe, the future of the people of European countries, will depend on the outcome of this struggle.

### 保障欧洲爱好和平的人民的安全——“真理报”十八日社论的摘要

    保障欧洲爱好和平的人民的安全
    ——“真理报”十八日社论的摘要
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”十八日发表社论，题目是“保障欧洲爱好和平的人民的安全”。
    社论首先指出，苏联政府采取的新的和平步骤引起了热烈的反应。这一明确的建议要求各国的政治人物采取肯定的立场。真正拥护和平和欧洲安全的人都赞同和支持苏联的建议，而和平和欧洲安全的敌人不惜采取种种狡猾的手腕和不名誉的阴谋来拒绝这一建议。
    社论指出，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国政府已经发表声明，罗马尼亚和保加利亚两国政府已经复照苏联，支持苏联关于召开讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议的建议，并声明它们愿意参加这个会议。
    社论指出：一切真正拥护和平和欧洲安全的人都热烈地欢迎苏联的建议。法国、英国、西德和其他国家的目光远大的政界人士坚决指出：苏联政府建议举行的全欧会议，将使各国有机会考虑目前欧洲舆论界所关心的最重要问题。他们强调指出，批准巴黎协定和武装西德不会使欧洲各国之间的关系好转，反而会使得它更加困难，只有欧洲的敌人才欢喜这样。
    社论说：和平和欧洲安全的敌人在一定得在保证欧洲安全或是复活德国军国主义两者之间选择一条道路时，不得不公开地表明，他们不愿意和欧洲人民一起反对德国复仇主义者，而愿意和梦想向东方和西方发动新的流血进军的德国复仇主义者一起来反对欧洲各国人民。现在比过去任何时候都更加明显：欧洲安全和复活德国军国主义是水火不相容的。这一无可置辩的真理每一个人都应该明白。
    社论说：反对复活德国军国主义的斗争，这不仅是争取和平和欧洲安全的斗争，而且是维护欧洲各国人民的独立的斗争。巴黎协定完全不是像法国和英国的某些人物所说的那样，会巩固西欧国家的地位；而是使他们的国家屈服于德国军国主义。
    社论说：西欧各国政府负有重大的责任。它们必须要向全世界表示：它们是放弃它们在伦敦和巴黎采取的危险方针而拥护欧洲集体安全呢，还是仍旧坚持这一方针，拒绝苏联建议，不参加全欧会议。它们对这一建议的答复，不是打开走向欧洲真正和平合作的道路，就是加剧紧张局势，而加剧紧张局势必然会使欧洲各个国家之间和一些国家同另一些国家之间的关系恶化。
    社论又指出：美、英、法三国的显要人物为急忙武装西德的计划所进行的辩护又一次明显地表明了，巴黎协定的矛头是针对着欧洲各国爱好和平的人民的安全的。欧洲各国人民将从此作出必要的结论。
    社论在指出波兰政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府所表示的将考虑采取措施以保障本国安全的决心后说：爱好和平的各国人民一定会赞同采取保障和加强安全的措施，来对付在美国侵略集团坚持下复活的德国军国主义。
    社论说：苏联人民一向为巩固和平与国际合作而积极地斗争，他们坚决支持苏联政府为保障和平与欧洲安全而作的努力。他们相信，欧洲其他国家的人民不会袖手旁观，而会参加欧洲和平与安全的捍卫者和复活德国军国主义的人之间的生死搏斗。欧洲的未来，欧洲各国人民的未来将系于这一斗争的结果。
