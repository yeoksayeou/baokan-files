Let the People of the Capital Eat Cheap and Fresh Vegetables
　　Yi Caoliang's Opinion on Vegetable Supply
　　Editor:
　　I am a staff member engaged in vegetable supply and marketing in Beijing. Here, we often hear reflections from some housewives and purchasing personnel saying that the quality of our vegetables is not good. When they buy a few pounds of vegetables, they have to pick out a large bunch of yellowed leaves, and there are few varieties available, and they often cannot buy what they need. I feel very uneasy when I hear these reflections, because vegetables are something everyone needs and relate to everyone's daily life. If we cannot do a good job in supply and meet the needs of the people's daily lives, how can we be worthy of all the citizens? In order to improve the supply work, I reported the opinions of the masses to the higher authorities, but some people said, "We have spent a lot of effort to ensure that everyone has vegetables to eat, but the masses still complain about the quality. We are losing money every day, do the masses know that?" I am very surprised: Why is the public making loss-making transactions, but the masses are still not satisfied? It is said that the Vegetable Management Department loses money every month, which is absolutely unacceptable. I sincerely suggest that the relevant leaders in Beijing should quickly change the current loss-making situation in the vegetable supply work and let the citizens eat cheap and fresh vegetables.

　　Investigation by the Reader's Letters Group of This Newspaper
　　Generally speaking, the vegetable supply work in Beijing has been very successful. Although there was excessive rainfall between this summer and autumn, and vegetable production decreased, Beijing still ensured the supply of vegetables, which is indeed not an easy task. However, according to readers' reflections and our investigation and understanding, there are indeed some problems in the current vegetable supply work in Beijing that need to be further improved.

　　First of all, we must solve the chaos in management and the phenomenon of business losses. It is true that each vegetable station and distribution point in Beijing is doing loss-making business. According to Comrade Gai Wenlin, Deputy Director of the Vegetable Office, the loss-making phenomenon in vegetable supply is serious. The Vegetable Management Department inspected the business situation of the Guang'anmen, Fuchengmen, and Tianqiao vegetable stations on September 16th. The inspection results showed that these three vegetable stations lost 8 million yuan every day. As for the business situation of the city's more than 120 distribution points, because they did not establish separate accounts for vegetable management, there is still no clue.

　　Secondly, we must improve maintenance and loading and unloading work. Beijing's vegetables are poorly maintained and loaded and unloaded. Taking maintenance work as an example, vegetables should be watered and cooled according to their varieties during storage; however, some comrades emphasize that only by improving equipment, expanding vegetable storage yards, and building cold storage, insulation, and ventilation warehouses can maintenance work be done well. Because adding these equipments requires a large amount of capital and involves urban planning, it is certainly not something that can be done in a short period of time. However, if we pay attention to improvement based on the existing conditions and sign good production and sales contracts, and regard agricultural production cooperatives as "living warehouses," then the vegetable maintenance situation can be improved. There are also problems with the loading and unloading of vegetables. Reporters personally saw staff members loading and unloading cabbages and Chinese cabbages at vegetable stations such as Fuchengmen and Guang'anmen, throwing them as if they were throwing a ball, a distance of ten feet away. As a result, the outer leaves of the cabbage were broken, and if stored for a few days, they would naturally rot. According to reporters, the number of such loading and unloading is also very frequent. From production to sales, from wholesale to retail, loading, loading into baskets, and unloading baskets occur no less than six or seven times, each time leaving a layer of leftover vegetables.

　　Because the maintenance and loading and unloading work has not received due attention, the loss due to spoilage and depreciation is particularly serious. According to the estimate of the Dongsi District Consumer Cooperative in July, the loss due to spoilage and depreciation plus transportation and handling fees accounted for 65.9% of the gross profit in the operation of 450,000 kilograms of vegetables.

　　Thirdly, it is necessary to establish the concept of serving consumers and understand their needs. For example, some time ago, in Beijing, people usually lined up on Saturdays and Sundays to buy chives (because workers and office cadres use chives to make dumpling fillings on Sundays), but chives were often out of stock on Sundays. The shortage of chives was not because the production of chives could not meet the demand, but because of improper scheduling and neglect of investigation and research work. Ji Chengwen, the person in charge of the Guiding Section of the Dongsi District Consumer Cooperative, said, "What's the use of investigating these things? Even if we figure out the details, it won't solve much of a problem." As a result, they have been in a state of blind operation for a long time.

　　Is it necessary to lose money in the vegetable business? According to the investigation of reporters at the Dongdan District Vegetable Supply Station, the loss-making situation of vegetables can be completely avoided. The Dongdan Vegetable Supply Station directly signed a production and sales contract with the Hongguang Vegetable Production Cooperative in Nanyuan District, near Beijing. Since the signing of the production and sales contract, both buyers and sellers have not only saved the 7% handling fee that must be paid for transactions in the market, but also farmers directly deliver vegetables to distribution points, reducing transportation costs by 8 yuan per catty, and the number of loading and unloading has also been reduced from six or seven times to three or four times; Furthermore, because the goods are directly imported from the place of origin, the loss due to spoilage and depreciation caused by storage during storage is reduced, and the freshness of the vegetable quality is maintained. After the Dongdan District Vegetable Station formally fulfilled the production and sales contract, the sales volume gradually expanded due to the strengthening of the transportation and sales plan, from the original daily sales of 15,000 catties to gradually increasing to daily sales of 24,000 to 5,000 catties; in September, they paid more than 20 million yuan in commercial profits to the state in vegetable management. Since October 10th, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office has adjusted the purchase and sale price differences of vegetables, and the loss situation in wholesale operations has changed somewhat. However, the example of Dongdan District is still worth in-depth study and promotion by the leaders of vegetable supply in Beijing.

　　让首都人民吃到便宜新鲜的蔬菜
  　易操良对蔬菜供应的意见编辑同志：
    我是北京市一个做蔬菜供销工作的人员。在我们这里，经常听到一些家庭主妇和采购人员的反映，说我们的蔬菜质量不好，买几斤蔬菜，要拣剔一大把黄菜，而且品种又少，经常买不到需要的东西。我听到这些反映，心里十分不安。因为蔬菜是“百家货”，它关系到每个人的日常生活。我们如果不能做好供应工作，满足人民日常生活的需要，怎样对得起全体市民呢？为了改善供应工作，我把群众的意见向上面反映，有的人却说，“我们花了九牛二虎的力气，保证大家有菜吃，群众还要嫌好嫌丑，我们天天在赔钱，群众知道不知道呢？”我很奇怪：为什么公家做了赔本生意，而群众还不满意呢？据说蔬菜经理部每个月都要赔钱，这是绝对不能容忍下去的。我诚恳地建议北京市有关领导方面迅速改变目前供应蔬菜工作中的赔本状况，并让市民们吃到廉价的新鲜的蔬菜。　　　易操良
  　本报读者来信组的调查
    北京市的蔬菜供应工作，一般的说是做得很有成绩的；虽然今年夏秋之间雨水过多，蔬菜减产，而北京市仍然保证了蔬菜的供应，这确实是一件不容易的事情。但据读者反映和我们调查了解，目前北京市的蔬菜供应工作确实还存在着一些问题，需要进一步的改进。
    首先要解决经营管理上的混乱和营业上的亏损现象。北京市各菜站各分销处的确在做赔本生意。据蔬菜办公室副主任盖文林同志讲，蔬菜供应中的亏损现象是严重的。蔬菜经理部曾检查了广安门、阜城门、天桥三个菜站九月十六日那天的营业情况，检查结果，这三个菜站每天要赔八百万元。至于全市的一百二十多个分销处的营业情况，由于他们没有把蔬菜经营另立帐册，所以至今也没有头绪。
    其次，要改进保养、装卸工作。北京市的蔬菜在保养、装卸方面是做得很差的。拿保养工作来说，蔬菜在停放期间，应该分别品种注意洒水和冷晾；可是有些同志却强调：改善设备，扩大停放菜场，兴建冷藏、保暖、通风等仓库设备才能做好保养工作。因为增添这些设备，需要一笔很大的资金，而且涉及到都市规划，当然不是短时期内所能办到的。但是，如果根据现有条件，注意改进，并订好产销合同，把农业生产合作社当作“活仓库”，那末，蔬菜保养状况是可以改善的。蔬菜的装卸工作也有问题。记者在阜城门、广安门等菜站亲眼看到装卸洋白菜大白菜的工作人员，象扔皮球一样一扔一丈来远，结果白菜外层的叶子摔破了，停放几天，当然就会腐烂了。据记者了解，象这样的装卸次数也是很频繁的，从产到销，从批发到零售，装车、装筐、倒筐不下六、七次，每次都留下一层残菜。
    由于保养、装卸工作没有得到应有的重视，因而腐烂减值的损耗也就显得特别严重。根据东四区消费合作社七月份的估计，在经营四十五万斤蔬菜当中，腐烂减值的损耗加上运输费手续费合计占了毛利的百分之六十五点九。
    其三，要树立为消费者服务的观念，了解消费者的需要。如在前一个时候，北京市每逢星期六、星期日通常有人排一列长队买韭菜（因为工人和机关干部，在星期日用韭菜做饺子馅儿），而星期日的韭菜却常常脱销。韭菜脱销并不是因为韭菜的产量供不应求，而是由于调度不当，忽视调查研究工作。东四区消费合作社组导科的负责人季承文说，调查这些有什么用呢？摸到了底也不能解决多大问题。因而他们长期处于盲目经营的状态中。
    是不是经营蔬菜一定要赔钱呢？据记者在东单区蔬菜供应站的调查了解，蔬菜的赔本状况是完全可以避免的。东单蔬菜供应站曾和京郊南苑区红光蔬菜生产合作社直接订立产销合同，自从订立产销合同以来，买卖双方不仅节省了在市场上成交须交纳百分之七的手续费，而且菜农直接向分销处送菜，运费每斤降低了八元，装卸的次数也由六、七次减少到三、四次；更由于由产地直接进货，减少了蔬菜因停放期间所造成的腐烂减值等损耗，保持了蔬菜质量的新鲜。东单区蔬菜站在正式履行产销合同以后，由于加强了运销计划，销售量日渐扩大，由原来日销一万五千斤，逐渐上升到日销两万四、五千斤；九月份他们在蔬菜经营方面向国家缴纳了两千余万元的商业利润。自十月十日起，北京市供销合作总社调整了蔬菜收售差价，批发经营的亏损情况有了一些改变。不过，东单区的例子，仍值得北京市蔬菜供应领导方面深入研究，加以推广。
