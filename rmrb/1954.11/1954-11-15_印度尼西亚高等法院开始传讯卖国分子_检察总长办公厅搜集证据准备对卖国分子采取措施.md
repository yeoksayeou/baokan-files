Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 13th: TASS Jakarta, November 13th - President Sukarno's speech in Palembang, condemning the treasonous activities of some opposition party leaders, has evoked a wide response across the country. The majority of newspapers and parties have demanded that severe measures be taken against traitors, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang elements in Indonesia, and the subversive activities of agents of colonial countries.

Antara News Agency reported that the High Court, based on the President's speech, has begun summoning leaders and senior officials of some parties who were bought by colonial countries and participated in conspiracies against the republican system and against the Sastroamidjojo government.

The "Independent Daily" editorial wrote that Western countries, in order to achieve their imperialist goals in Indonesia, have bought some leaders and officials. The newspaper emphasized: "However, the Indonesian people, who hope to implement an independent policy and coexist peacefully with the people of all countries, will not be bought."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 14th: According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Prosecutor General's Office has obtained a list of people engaged in treasonous activities as pointed out by President Sukarno. Sukarno recently said that some Indonesians have accepted millions of rupiah in bribes to engage in political activities that serve foreign interests.

Antara News Agency said that these people include senior personnel in the government and various political parties.

Antara News Agency also said that the Prosecutor General's Office is collecting evidence and will take measures to deal with this incident.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 14th: The Indonesian "Independent Daily" commented on November 12th on President Sukarno's speech accusing traitorous elements, saying that the participation of foreigners in the anti-republic activities of some Indonesians is part of their international Cold War activities; these activities aim to overthrow the current government and replace it with a government that will join a bloc hostile to it. In discussing this issue, the "Independent Daily" mentioned the recent statement by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles said that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is incomplete without Indonesia's participation.

The "Independent Daily" said that Dulles's statement is significant when viewed in connection with the new situation in Indonesia, where certain political leaders have become tools exploited by foreign countries, and they are prepared to destroy Indonesia's own right to freely decide policies that are most beneficial to the country.

    印度尼西亚高等法院开始传讯卖国分子
    检察总长办公厅搜集证据准备对卖国分子采取措施
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社雅加达十三日讯：苏加诺总统在巨港发表的谴责一些在野党领导人从事卖国活动的演说在全国引起了广泛的反应。大多数报纸和党派都要求对卖国者、对在印度尼西亚的蒋介石国民党分子和殖民国家的代理人的颠覆活动采取严厉措施。
    安塔拉通讯社报道，高等法院已依据总统的演说而开始传讯一些党派的领导人和高级官员，这些人都是为殖民国家收买并参与反对共和制度、反对沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府的阴谋的人。
      “独立报”社论写道，西方国家为了要在印度尼西亚达到他们帝国主义的目的，收买了一些领导人和官员。报纸强调说：“但是，希望实行独立政策并且和各国人民和平共处的印度尼西亚人民是不会被收买的。”
    【新华社雅加达十四日电】据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚检察总长办公厅已经获得苏加诺总统所指出的从事卖国活动的人的名单。苏加诺最近说过，有些印度尼西亚人已经接受成百万盾的贿赂来从事为外国利益服务的政治活动。
    安塔拉通讯社说，这些人包括有政府和各政党中的高级人员。
    安塔拉通讯社并且说，检察总长办公厅正在搜集证据，并将采取处理这一事件的措施。
    【新华社雅加达十四日电】印度尼西亚“独立报”十二日评论苏加诺总统指责卖国分子活动的演讲说，外国人参加一些印度尼西亚人的反对共和国的活动，是他们进行国际冷战活动的一部分；这些活动的目的是要推翻现政府，而以一个将会参加到敌对集团中的一个集团去的政府来代替现政府。在谈到这一个问题时，“独立报”提到美国国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的声明。杜勒斯说，东南亚条约组织没有印度尼西亚参加是不完整的。
    “独立报”说，如果同印度尼西亚的新形势联系起来看，杜勒斯的声明是意味深长的；在印度尼西亚，某些政治领袖已变成外国利用的工具，他们准备摧毁印度尼西亚自己决定对本国最有利的政策的自由权利。
