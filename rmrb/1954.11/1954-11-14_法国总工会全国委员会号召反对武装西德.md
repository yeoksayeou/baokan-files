Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 13th. The National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor held a meeting on the 9th and 10th.

    French General Confederation of Labor Secretary, Léon Mauvais, delivered a report at the meeting on the struggle for peace and to satisfy the demands of the working people. He sharply criticized the domestic and foreign policies of the Mendès-France government, pointing out that Mendès-France's stance on the budget issue proved that the government did not want to satisfy the legitimate demands of the working people, but wanted to increase military and police spending and guarantee the profits of capitalists.

    Mauvais called for strengthening united action to defeat the London and Paris Agreements. He pointed out: struggles should be launched in various enterprises, institutions, factories, and workshops to encourage people to actively collect signatures for petitions protesting the rearmament of West Germany and demanding that the Four Powers reopen negotiations on the German issue. The working people should send delegations to meet with members of the National Assembly, demanding that they oppose the London and Paris Agreements.

    Mauvais also called for strengthening the unity of action with the working people of the Socialist Party and the working people of other parties and trade union organizations.

    During the discussion of Mauvais' report, the vast majority of people emphasized that it is necessary to simultaneously carry out the struggle to satisfy the basic demands of the working masses and the struggle against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. French General Confederation of Labor General Secretary Le Léap said: Mendès-France sacrificed France's independence and the possibility of improving the living conditions of workers, because the arms race made it impossible to satisfy the demands of the working masses. He called on trade union organizations to more actively participate in the peace movement and to fight for a negotiated settlement of the German issue by the Four Powers.

    A representative of the Liaison Committee of Algerian Trade Unions reported at the meeting on the bloody suppression by French troops of the Algerian people fighting for national independence.

    The meeting passed a resolution on general issues, which pointed out the correctness of the French General Confederation of Labor's policy of striving for peace, disarmament, and opposing the rearmament of West Germany in any form. The resolution emphasized that it is impossible to restore France's economic position and France's independence without satisfying the legitimate demands of the French working people. The resolution stipulates that the guaranteed minimum wage should be 25,166 francs per month.

    The meeting also passed an open letter to the French working people and a resolution on the Algerian situation, and decided to convene the 30th Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor in June next year.

    法国总工会全国委员会号召反对武装西德
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会全国委员会在九日和十日举行会议。
    法国总工会书记利昂·摩维在会上作了关于为和平和满足劳动人民的要求而奋斗的报告。他对孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的内政和外交政策提出了尖锐的指责，指出孟戴斯—弗朗斯在预算问题上采取的立场证明了政府不想满足劳动人民的正当要求，而要增加军队和警察的开支，要保障资本家的利润。
    摩维号召加强一致行动来打倒伦敦和巴黎协定。他指出：应该在各企业、机关、工厂和作坊中展开斗争，争取人民积极为抗议重新武装西德和要求四大国就德国问题重开谈判的请愿书征集签名。劳动人民应该派代表团去见国民议会议员，要求他们反对伦敦协定和巴黎协定。
    摩维还要求增强同社会党劳动人民及其他党派和工会组织的劳动人民的行动一致。
    在讨论摩维的报告时，绝大多数的人都着重指出：必须同时进行争取满足劳动群众的基本要求和反对批准伦敦协定及巴黎协定的斗争。法国总工会总书记勒里普说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯牺牲了法国的独立和改善工人生活条件的可能性，因为军备竞赛使满足劳动群众的要求成为不可能。他要求工会组织更积极地参加和平运动，为争取四大国协商解决德国问题而斗争。
    阿尔及利亚工会联络委员会的代表在会上报告了法国军队对争取民族独立的阿尔及利亚人民的血腥镇压。
    会议就一般问题通过决议，决议指出了法国总工会所执行的争取和平、裁军和反对以任何形式重新武装西德的政策的正确性。决议着重指出：不满足法国劳动人民的正当要求，就不可能恢复法国的经济地位和法国的独立。决议规定有保证的最低工资为每月二万五千一百六十六法郎。
    会议还通过了告法国劳动人民书和关于阿尔及利亚形势的决议，并且决定在明年六月召开法国总工会第三十届代表大会。
