    State-owned Lutai Farm Achieves a Bumper Rice Harvest
    State-owned Lutai Farm is one of China's larger mechanized farms. This year, the farm's more than 16,000 mu of rice paddies, due to the adoption of the Soviet advanced "dry planting and broadcasting method" and strengthened field management, overcame the natural disasters of drought in early summer and excessive rain in late autumn, achieving an average yield of approximately 620 jin of rice per mu.
    The superiority demonstrated by the state-owned Lutai Farm in cultivation has greatly attracted the vast number of farmers around the farm to move towards collective production, enabling the mutual aid and cooperation movement to develop rapidly; enabling farmers to obtain even greater harvests year after year.

    After harvesting the rice, the farm workers drive tractors to carry out autumn plowing in the fields. The state-owned Lutai Farm uses combine harvesters to harvest rice in large areas of paddy fields.
    The farm is learning from the Soviet experience of combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and has purchased more than 300 head of dairy cows from Hailar.
    Farm technicians are visiting the Xiaobeijiangu Agricultural Production Cooperative and helping them solve technical problems.

    国营芦台农场水稻丰收
    国营芦台农场是我国较大的机械农场之一。今年农场的一万六千多亩水稻，由于采用了苏联先进的“旱植播耕种法”和加强了田间管理，战胜了入夏天旱、近秋雨多的自然灾害，获得每亩平均可收稻谷六百二十斤左右的丰收。
    国营芦台农场在耕作上所表现的优越性，大大地吸引着农场周围的广大农民走向集体生产，使得互助合作运动迅速地发展也来；使得农民获得了一年比一年更大的丰收。
