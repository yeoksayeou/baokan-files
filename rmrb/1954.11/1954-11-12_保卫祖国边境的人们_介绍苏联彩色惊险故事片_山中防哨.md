The Soviet color thriller film "Frontier Post in the Mountains" depicts the tense and complex combat life of the Soviet border guards in defending the borders of the Soviet motherland. The film portrays the heroic, resourceful, and tenacious revolutionary heroism displayed by the Soviet border post soldiers in defending the border, while also exposing the plots of imperialist agents and spies infiltrating the Soviet borders to carry out sabotage activities. The struggle depicted in the film is sharp, and the development of the plot is rapid, tense, tortuous, and captivating. Before us unfolds a series of breathtaking scenes: Sergeant Kuleshov and Private Marchenko patrol a narrow mountain road late at night, encounter an earthquake, and are trapped in a cave by falling rocks. The carrier pigeon they release for help is eaten by an eagle, and the horse they send back to deliver a message encounters a tiger, runs to the opposite bank of the river, and is captured by Ismail bandits outside the border; Lieutenant Runin, the commander of the border post, leads the border guards into the mountains to search for Kuleshov and Marchenko. They are forced to have their horses jump over the broken bridge caused by rocks crushing the wooden bridge and a rapid river current. The Ismail bandits, incited by the special agent Stanly, madly drive their horses across the river to invade the Soviet border. Three Soviet border post soldiers bravely, calmly, and accurately fight a fierce battle against enemies dozens of times their number. The dangerous situation when Kuleshov breaks through the enemy's encirclement to deliver a message to the collective farm and is urgently pursued by the enemy; Vera's resourceful and courageous struggle when she encounters the special agent Malau, who has infiltrated the border, on the mountain road home from school; the urgent moment when Sergeant Kuleshov discovers Vera's notebook scattered on the mountain road, climbs down the cliff by means of a rope tied to a horse to save Vera, and the special agent Malau attempts to cut the rope with a knife; Kuleshov, following the footprints left by the special agent on the paper, tracks him down, discovers the startled birds in the ancient tomb, and vigilantly and bravely arrests the special agent, who is then injured by another special agent who has infiltrated the border while being escorted to the border post command. All these scenes make the audience hold their breath. The audience's tense and excited emotions deepen layer by layer with the rapid development of the film's plot. We are worried about the hero's crisis and rejoice in the hero's victory.

Through these scenes of fierce struggle, the film not only shows the enemy's brutality and cunning, but also brilliantly depicts the noble spiritual qualities of the border post soldiers.

Lieutenant Runin, an officer at the border post command, is an experienced young officer. As soon as he arrives at the post, Captain Prokhorov leaves the post to recuperate due to illness. Lieutenant Runin bravely shoulders the responsibility of the entire post. But what a complex environment he faces: surrounded by continuous mountain ranges, the geographical conditions here are very complex, with subtropical climates, mountainous areas with permanent ice and snow, and earthquake zones where mountains often collapse and the earth cracks, with sandstorms and wild animals that often appear in the mountains and reeds along the riverbanks. On the opposite bank of the border river, there is activity and harassment by Ismail bandits, as well as spies and special agents sent by imperialism disguised as "antique investigation teams" who are constantly trying to cross the border illegally. Facing such a complex environment, he calmly, skillfully, and decisively undertakes this arduous task. He inspected the entire post and strictly required the soldiers to be vigilant. When he heard that the duty squad soldiers Shumov and Lagutin reported to him after patrolling that they had found the hoof prints of wild boars in a new place, he decided to strengthen the duty of the "snake-shaped path" nearby based on a precise analysis of the situation. When he was talking with Captain Prokhorov's mother in the room, and the earthquake shook things down in the room, his first thought was not his own safety, but concern for the two soldiers who were patrolling in the mountains. When he led his soldiers on horseback into the mountains to find the lost two soldiers, and encountered a broken bridge, he fearlessly took the lead in having his horse jump over the broken bridge. When he was fighting fiercely with the bandits who were invading the border, he was still afraid that the enemy would take the opportunity to cross the border illegally from the snake-shaped path, so he decided to send someone to deliver a message to the collective farm chairman to have people defend it. Through the description of these actions, the film shows us the image of a resolute, decisive, and highly vigilant young commander.

Sergeant Kuleshov is also vividly depicted. Kuleshov possesses the beautiful qualities of a Soviet soldier: bravery, flexibility, optimism, loyalty to military duty, loyalty to the motherland, and loyalty to the cause of communism. There are many vivid descriptions of Kuleshov in the film. For example, the scene where he trains his horse; the scene where he feeds the sugar he saved to a horse that doesn't belong to him; the dangerous scene where he is pursued by several bandits while carrying out the task of delivering a message to the collective farm chairman; the scene where he follows the footprints left by the special agent on the paper, tracks him down, and discovers the hidden special agent based on the clue of the startled birds flying out of the ancient tomb; and the scene where he is injured in the hospital, and when Marchenko goes to see him, the two decide to continue requesting to serve a second term of military service and never leave the border, all vividly embody his character traits.

The film does not have many scenes depicting Captain Prokhorov's mother, but in her attitude towards her son Prokhorov, towards the newly transferred Lieutenant Runin, and towards his wife Vera, she shows a woman who is resolute, slightly stern, but also kind-hearted.

The film also vividly depicts Lieutenant Runin's wife, Vera. When Vera came to such a remote mountainous area from Moscow with the habit of being pampered, she was not used to it, but under the help and education of Captain Prokhorov's mother, and after the test of practical life, she gradually became stronger and took her place. The brave act she displayed when she encountered an enemy crossing the border illegally on a mountain road, and was willing to sacrifice herself to defend the motherland's border, depicts the image of a pure, brave, and highly patriotic young woman.

After watching the film, we deeply realize that it is precisely because of these noble qualities of the Soviet people and their unparalleled love for their motherland that a solid and unbreakable force has been formed. One cannot help but be convinced that no matter how insidious and cunning the enemy is, all conspiracies and sabotage activities are doomed to fail in the face of the heroic Soviet people. The Soviet border is sacred and inviolable! At the same time, it also makes people firmly believe that there is no force in the world that can stop the brave Soviet people from advancing towards a communist society.

The performance of "Frontier Post in the Mountains" has profound educational significance for the people of our country who are engaged in socialist construction. It tells us that as long as the forces of imperialist aggression exist for one day, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest. At present, both inside and outside our country, imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under the protection of US imperialism are stepping up their efforts to send special agents and spies, constantly looking for opportunities to infiltrate our country and carry out sabotage activities in order to undermine China's revolutionary cause. Therefore, we must learn from the patriotism of the Soviet border guards, heighten our vigilance, and defend the motherland.

    保卫祖国边境的人们
    ——介绍苏联彩色惊险故事片“山中防哨”

    苏联彩色惊险故事片“山中防哨”，是表现苏联边防军保卫苏维埃祖国边境的紧张、复杂的战斗生活的影片。影片一方面描写了苏联边境防哨战士在保卫边境时所表现的英勇、机敏、顽强的革命英雄主义精神，一方面揭露了帝国主义派遣特务间谍潜入苏联国境进行破坏活动的阴谋。影片所描写的斗争是尖锐的，情节的发展是迅速、紧张、曲折、引人入胜的。在我们的面前，展开了一幅幅惊心动魄的画面：中士库烈绍夫和兵士马尔琴科深夜在一条狭窄的山路上巡逻，遇到地震，被滚下来的山石堵在山洞里，他们放出去求援的通讯鸽被老鹰吃掉，他们放回去送信的马路遇老虎，跑到了河对岸，被边境外的依资麦尔匪徒捉去；边境防哨指挥官鲁宁中尉带着边防战士到山里去寻找库烈绍夫和马尔琴科时，因木桥被山石压断，不得不纵马跳过河水急流的断桥；被特务分子斯兼里煽动起来的依资麦尔匪徒疯狂地驱马渡河侵犯苏联国境时，三个苏联边境防哨战士英勇、沉着、准确地迎击多于自己数十倍的敌人的激烈战斗；库烈绍夫冲出敌人包围去集体农庄送信，被敌人紧急追赶时的危险情况；威拉在从学校回家的山路上遇到潜入国境的特务马劳时所进行的机智、英勇的斗争；中士库烈绍夫发现威拉撒在山路上的笔记本，攀着拴在马身上的绳子下悬崖去救威拉时，特务马劳企图用小刀割掉绳子的紧急时刻；库烈绍夫按着特务留在纸上的脚印，跟踪追寻，发现古坟中被惊动的鸟，机警、勇敢地逮捕了特务，把特务解往防哨指挥所时被另一潜入国境的特务打伤。所有这些场面，使人屏住了呼吸。观众紧张激动的感情随着影片情节的迅速发展一层层深入。我们为英雄的危急而提心吊胆，为英雄的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    通过这些激烈斗争的场面，不仅表现了敌人的凶残和狡猾，更出色地表现了边境防哨战士们的崇高的精神品质。
    边境防哨指挥所军官鲁宁中尉，是一个有经验的青年军官，他刚到哨所，上尉普罗赫罗夫即因病离开哨所去休养。整个哨所的责任，鲁宁中尉勇敢地担负了。但是摆在他面前的是一个多么复杂的环境：四周是峰峦绵延的山区，这里地理条件非常复杂，有气候温和的亚热带，有常年冰雪不化的山区，还有那经常山崩地裂的地震区，有大风沙，有在山中、河岸芦苇中经常出没的野兽；国境线的河对岸有依资麦尔匪徒的活动和骚扰，还有帝国主义派遣的间谍、特务分子伪装成“古物考察团”，时刻企图偷越国境。他面临这样一个复杂的环境，沉着、熟练、果敢地担负了这一艰巨任务。他巡视了整个哨所，并严格地要求战士们提高警惕。当他听到勤务组战士舒莫夫和拉古金巡逻回来向他报告在一个新的地方发现了野猪的蹄子印时，他根据对情况的精密分析，决定加强了那儿附近“蛇形小道”的勤务。他和上尉普罗赫罗夫的母亲在房中谈话，地震把房中的东西震落时，他首先想到的不是自己的安全，而是关心着正在山中巡视的两个战士。他带领战士骑马到山中寻找失落的两个战士，路遇断桥时，他毫不畏惧地带头纵马跳过断桥。他同侵犯国境的匪徒进行着激烈的战斗时，他仍怕敌人乘机从蛇形小道偷越国境，而决定派人送信要集体农庄主席带人防守。影片通过这些行动的描写，使我们看见了一个刚毅、坚决、具有高度警惕性的青年指挥官形象。
    中士库烈绍夫也得到了生动的描写。库烈绍夫具有苏联军人勇敢、灵活、乐观、忠于军人职责、忠于祖国、忠于共产主义事业的优美品质。影片关于库烈绍夫有许多镜头的描写是生动的。例如影片描写他训练马的镜头；他把节省下来的沙糖喂不是属于他的马的镜头；他在执行给集体农庄主席送信的任务，路上被数骑匪徒追击的危险镜头；他按着特务留在纸上的脚印，跟踪追寻，根据古坟中飞出被惊起的鸟的线索发现隐藏的特务的镜头；以及他受伤在医院里，马尔琴科去看他时，两个人决定继续请求服第二次兵役，永不离开边境的镜头，都鲜明地体现了他的性格特征。
    影片描写上尉普罗赫罗夫的母亲的镜头并不多，但是她在对待他的儿子普罗赫罗夫、对待新调来的鲁宁中尉和他的妻子威拉的态度上，表现出了一个意志坚决，稍有些严峻，但同时又是心地善良的妇女。
    影片也生动地描写了中尉鲁宁的妻子威拉。威拉带着骄生惯养的习惯从莫斯科来到这样一个偏远的山区时，是不习惯的，但是她在上尉普罗赫罗夫的母亲的帮助教育下，经过实际生活的考验，逐渐坚强起来，并站到了自己的岗位上。当她在山路上遇到了偷越国境的敌人时，所表现的勇于自我牺牲保卫祖国边境时的勇敢行为，描绘出了一个纯洁、英勇、具有高度爱国主义精神的青年妇女的形象。
    看过影片后，我们深深体会到，正是由于苏联人民的这些高尚品质和对祖国无比的热爱，才形成了坚固不可破的力量。不能不令人信服地相信：无论敌人多么阴险、狡猾，一切阴谋破坏活动，在英勇的苏联人民面前都注定要失败，苏联国境是神圣的，不可侵犯的！同时，也令人坚信：世界上没有一种力量能阻挡勇敢的苏联人民向着共产主义社会前进。
    “山中防哨”的上演，对正在进行社会主义建设的我国人民有深刻的教育意义。它告诉我们：只要帝国主义侵略势力存在一天，我们就不能丝毫放松警惕。目前在我国内外，帝国主义和在美帝国主义庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团，为了破坏中国的革命事业，正加紧派遣特务、间谍分子，无时无刻不在伺隙潜入我国进行破坏活动。因此，我们必须学习苏联边防军人的爱国主义精神，提高警惕，保卫祖国。
