The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, crossing the great grasslands of southwestern Qinghai and the Tanggula Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet border, opened to Heihe, a major town in northern Tibet, on November 16th.

The Qinghai-Tibet Highway starts in Xining, Qinghai, and ends in Lhasa, Tibet, with a total length of about 2,000 kilometers, mostly built on the great grasslands at an altitude of 4,500 to 5,400 meters above sea level. The highway crosses the four major tributaries of the Tongtian River and more than a dozen other rivers, traverses nine major mountains including the Kunlun Mountains and the Tanggula Mountains, and passes through areas inhabited by Hui, Mongolian, and Kazakh ethnic groups in places like Dulan. The section of the highway from Xining through Xiangride and Nuomuhong to Golmud had been partially repaired after liberation and was already open to traffic. Construction westward towards Tibet began from Golmud, Qinghai, in June this year. In order to open up the transportation artery between Qinghai and Tibet as soon as possible, the People's Liberation Army troops and people of all ethnic groups participating in the road construction overcame all difficulties. In more than five months, they completed the task of building more than 890 kilometers of road, extending the highway to Heihe.

During the road construction, the soldiers and civilians overcame the shortage of materials and the harsh climate on the desolate grasslands. They built "water-crossing road surfaces" in rivers flowing with ice floes and carried stones from more than ten miles away to fill deep gullies and swamps. Sixty percent of the road builders were commended for their meritorious service.

The Qinghai-Tibet Highway received enthusiastic support from the people of all ethnic groups along the route. When the highway reached the pastoral areas north of Heihe, the herdsmen presented Hada scarves to the road builders to express their gratitude and brought yak butter, beef, and other gifts of appreciation. The people of the Anduo Doma pastoral area organized many yaks to help the road builders transport materials. Currently, the road construction is progressing towards Lhasa according to the planned schedule.

    青藏公路越过青海大草原通车到黑河
    青藏公路越过青海西南部的大草原和青海西藏交界的唐古喇山，在十一月十六日通车到西藏北部的重镇——黑河。
    青藏公路的起点是青海西宁，终点是西藏拉萨，全长约两千公里，大部修筑在拔海四千五百公尺到五千四百公尺的大草原上。公路跨过了通天河的四大支流和其他十多条河流，越过了昆仑山、唐古喇山等九座大山，并经过都兰等地的回、蒙古和哈萨克等民族居住的地区。这条公路从西宁经香日得诺木洪到格尔穆，解放后曾经部分整修，已可通车，今年六月间从青海格尔穆开始向西藏修筑。为了早日打通青海和西藏间的交通动脉，参加筑路的中国人民解放军部队和各族民工，战胜了一切困难，在五个多月的时间内，完成了八百九十多公里的修路任务，把公路修到了黑河。
    在修路中，军工和民工们在漫无人烟的草原上，克服了材料缺乏和气候的困难，他们在流着冰块的河水中修筑“过水路面”，从十多里路以外背运石块填塞深沟和泥沼地。筑路人员有百分之六十的人立了功。
    青藏公路受到沿线各族人民的热烈支援。公路修到黑河北部牧区时，牧民们纷纷向筑路人员献哈达表示感激，并带来酥油、牛肉等慰问品。安多都麻牧区人民组织很多牦牛帮助筑路人员运送物资。现在，筑路工程正按照预定计划向拉萨推进。
