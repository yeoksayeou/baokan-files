    Not a "Small Matter"
    The current policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth has been smoothly implemented with the conscious support of the broad masses. However, before the implementation of unified sales in some areas, there was a phenomenon of panic buying of cotton cloth. It is worth noting that, in addition to a portion of the masses who lacked understanding and had a low level of awareness of the policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, there were also a few Communist Party members and state organ workers who participated in the panic buying. For example, in Guangzhou, some Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and government cadres, after hearing the announcement regarding the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, took the opportunity to snap up cotton cloth, and the actions of a very small number of them were quite egregious in nature.
    This is naturally not a "small matter," but a serious phenomenon that cannot be ignored. The Southern Daily, in conjunction with the local leading organs' inspection of the implementation of the cotton cloth unified purchase and sale policy by Party members and cadres, launched a criticism of this phenomenon.
    On October 12th, the newspaper published an article entitled "Violating the Unified Purchase and Sale Policy is a Concrete Manifestation of Bourgeois Individualism." The article pointed out that the phenomenon of panic buying of cotton cloth concentratedly exposed that some of our Party members, League members, and government cadres still harbor a rather serious bourgeois individualism. These people, in order to seek personal gain and convenience, disregard Party discipline and the discipline of state organs, disregard the impact on the masses, and openly violate the policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth. This article not only criticized the erroneous behavior of those who knowingly violated the policy and participated in the panic buying, but also criticized the erroneous thinking of those who, although they did not participate in the panic buying, expressed dissatisfaction with the unified sale of cotton cloth, "because all these behaviors and thoughts are behaviors and thoughts that only care about personal interests and disregard overall interests." Although the degree may be different, the essence is a manifestation of bourgeois individualism. However, not everyone recognizes the problem in this way. For example, some people see it as a small matter, thinking, "Is it really that serious to rush to buy a few feet of cotton cloth?" This article refuted this argument, clearly pointing out: "The problem is serious." The reason why the problem is serious is not in the few feet of cloth itself, but in the serious harm that the development of this bourgeois individualistic thought poses to the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the serious harm to the Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres themselves.
    Naturally, the phenomenon of panic buying of cotton cloth also exposed the weakness of political and ideological leadership in certain organs' Party organizations, lax discipline, and the tendency for cadres' theoretical and political studies to be divorced from reality. The Southern Daily successively published several articles criticizing and discussing these aspects. These articles raised the issue of enhancing the consciousness of Communist Party members and government cadres in observing discipline and the law, strengthening political and ideological education for Party members and cadres, and continuing to study the general line in depth and repeatedly in conjunction with specific tasks and specific policies.
    The analysis and criticism made by the Southern Daily on the violation of the cotton cloth unified purchase and sale policy by some Party members, League members, and government cadres in Guangzhou is timely and necessary. This kind of analysis and criticism has a certain effect on educating local Party members, cadres, and the broad masses of the people, establishing and consolidating the superiority of socialist thought, strengthening Party discipline, and enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness. However, the newspaper did not cite any specific typical examples in this criticism, which would have made the criticism more sharp and forceful, and this cannot but be a shortcoming, because such examples existed locally.

    不是“小事情”
    这次的棉布统购统销政策，在广大群众的自觉拥护下，得到了顺利的实施。但是有些地方在实行统销前，也发生了抢购棉布的现象。值得注意的是，参加抢购的人，除了一部分对棉布统购统销政策缺乏认识，觉悟程度不高的群众外，还有少数共产党员和国家机关工作人员。例如在广州就有一些共产党员、青年团员和机关干部，在听了关于棉布统购统销的传达之后，乘机抢购棉布，其中有极少数人的所作所为，在性质上是相当恶劣的。
    这自然不是什么“小事情”，而是一种不可忽视的严重现象。南方日报结合着当地领导机关对党员、干部执行棉布统购统销政策情况的检查，对这种现象展开了批判。
    十月十二日，报纸发表了“违反统购统销政策是资产阶级个人主义的具体表现”的文章。文章指出，这次抢购棉布的现象集中地暴露了在我们党员、团员和机关干部中还有一些人存有相当严重的资产阶级个人主义这些人为了贪图个人的利益和方便，就不顾党纪和国家机关的纪律，不顾对群众的影响，公然违反棉布统购统销的政策。这篇文章不仅批判了那些明知故犯、参加抢购的人的错误行为，同时也批判了那些虽然没有参加抢购但对棉布统销表示不满的人的错误思想，“因为所有这些行为和思想，都是只顾个人利益不顾整体利益的行为和思想”，尽管在程度上有所不同，实质上都是资产阶级个人主义的表现。但是，并不是所有的人都像这样来认识问题。例如有人就把这看作小事情，认为“抢先购买几尺棉布问题竟然这样严重吗？”这篇文章反驳了这种论调，明确指出：“问题是严重的”。问题之所以严重，不在于这几尺布本身，而在于这种资产阶级个人主义思想的发展对于社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的严重危害，对于共产党员和革命干部本人的严重危害。
    自然，这次抢购棉布的现象，也暴露了某些机关党的政治思想领导薄弱，纪律松弛，以及干部理论学习和政治学习中的脱离实际的倾向。南方日报陆续发表了几篇文章，对这些方面进行批判和讨论。在这些文章中提出了提高共产党员和机关干部遵纪守法的自觉性的问题，加强对党员和干部的政治思想教育的问题，结合具体任务和具体政策继续深入地反复地学习总路线的问题。
    南方日报对广州部分党员、团员和机关干部违反棉布统购统销政策所进行的分析批判是适时的和必要的。这种分析批判对于教育当地党员、干部和广大人民群众，树立和巩固社会主义思想的优势，加强党的纪律性，提高党的战斗力，有一定的作用。但是，报纸在这次的批判中没有举出任何具体的典型的例子，使得这一批判更为尖锐有力，这不能不是一个缺点，因为这种例子在当地是有的。　（钟　怀）
