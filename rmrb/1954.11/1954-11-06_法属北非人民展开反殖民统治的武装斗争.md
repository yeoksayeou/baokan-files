Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: The situation in French North Africa is tense. In Algeria, which was previously considered relatively calm, a wave of anti-colonial rule has also been set off.

On the night of October 31, more than 30 attacks occurred simultaneously in major cities of Algeria, targeting on-duty police and official institutions. It is reported that these attacks were organized by local nationalist forces. Dozens of people were killed or injured in the attacks.

On the evening of November 1, several French farms and gendarmerie posts were attacked in the province of Oran, Algeria. In the province of Constantine, rebel forces surrounded the large town of Arris and clashed with the army. As of the morning of the 3rd, the situation in Arris was said to remain "serious."

The events in Algeria greatly alarmed the colonial authorities, who adopted harsh suppression measures. The police station carried out arrests after the attacks. According to "l'Humanité," many leaders of the "Algerian Freedom and Victory Party" were arrested on November 2nd. The authorities imposed martial law in the districts of Batna, Khenchela, and Biskra, and carried out large-scale "searches." In the city of Constantine, police teams patrolled the streets with automatic guns, and guards were stationed at bridges and administrative buildings. In addition, the French government rushed three companies of infantry and one battalion of paratroopers to Algeria on November 2nd, and will continue to airlift two more battalions of paratroopers.

The extreme dissatisfaction of the broad masses of residents in Tunisia and Morocco with the colonial authorities is also manifested in the constant armed conflicts and shootings of on-duty police, French officials, and those who cooperate with the colonial authorities.

On November 2, a group of armed Tunisians engaged in a fierce conflict with the army in the Sakiet Sidi Youssef area, resulting in the death of fifteen Tunisians. Prior to this, on October 30 and 31, guerrilla activities took place northeast of Gafsa, Tunisia, and the colonial authorities sent "security" forces to "suppress" them. More than a dozen people were killed in the fighting. In Souk Ahras, "security" forces also clashed with guerrillas.

In Casablanca, Morocco, six people have been killed and twenty-one injured in recent attacks. The colonial authorities have carried out large-scale arrests in Casablanca and other cities in Morocco.

"Le Monde" in Paris revealed that while the French authorities are negotiating with Tunisia on "internal autonomy," they are pursuing a policy of armed suppression in North Africa, especially in Tunisia. "Le Monde" said: It seems that the primary task of the French government in North Africa is to carry out "suppression." The newspaper said in the same report: The French authorities in Tunisia have been carrying out a series of military operations since September 19. According to figures contained in a proposal on the situation in North Africa received by the United Nations on October 26, nearly 230 Tunisians have been killed "in the improper and shocking aggression of the French army" since the French-Tunisian negotiations began in September.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: According to TASS Paris, November 4th: According to Paris newspapers, the three provinces of Algeria are still in a tense situation. The newspapers wrote that about 1,000 Algerian rebel peasants with automatic weapons occupy the Arres mountains. Armed conflicts are also taking place in other areas.

The French authorities continue to take various measures to suppress the national liberation movement of the Algerian people. A large number of reinforcements are heading to Algeria, including paratroopers, gendarmes, and the so-called "Republican Security Force." In addition to towns such as Batna and Khenchela, the authorities are also conducting large-scale searches and arrests in Tebessa and other towns. The city of Tebessa and the large town of Arris have been placed under martial law. A large number of artillery units and tank units are now concentrated in Batna.

According to "Libération," the Algerian democratic newspaper "Liberté" has been ordered to be shut down by the French Governor-General. The French colonial authorities have banned trade union meetings in Constantine.

The French Under-Secretary of the Army, Jacques Chevallier, who is currently in Algeria, said on November 3 that suppressing the uprising in the Arres mountains would take "a lot of manpower and time."

    法属北非人民展开反殖民统治的武装斗争
    【新华社四日讯】法属北非局势紧张。在以前被认为比较平静的阿尔及利亚也掀起了反殖民统治的浪潮。
    十月三十一日深夜，在阿尔及利亚各大城市同时发生了三十多起袭击值岗警察和官方机构所在地的事件。据报道，这些袭击都是由当地的民族主义力量组织的。在袭击中有数十人伤亡。
    一日晚上，阿尔及利亚的阿兰省又发生了法国人的几个农场和宪兵岗哨遭到袭击的事件。在君士坦丁省，起义者的队伍包围了大市镇阿里斯，并和军队发生冲突。直到三日晨，阿里斯的情势据说仍然“严重”。
    在阿尔及利亚发生的事件使殖民当局大为惊慌，他们采取了严厉的镇压措施。警察局在袭击事件后进行了逮捕。据“人道报”报道，十一月二日被逮捕的有“阿尔及利亚自由胜利党”的许多领导人。当局在巴特那、汉塞拉和彼斯克拉各区实行戒严，并进行大规模的“搜查”。在君士坦丁城，警察队扛着自动枪在街上巡逻，各桥头和行政大厦都设置了卫队。此外，法国政府已经在十一月二日赶运三连步兵和一营伞兵到达阿尔及利亚，而且还要继续空运两营伞兵前往。
    突尼斯和摩洛哥广大居民对殖民当局的极度不满，也表现在不断发生的武装冲突和对值岗警察、法国官员以及和殖民当局合作的那些人的射击事件上。
    十一月二日，有一批武装的突尼斯人同军队在沙基特西地乌塞夫地区发生激烈冲突，结果有十五名突尼斯人被杀害。在这以前，十月三十日和三十一日，在突尼斯加弗沙东北有游击队活动，殖民当局派“治安”部队前往“清剿”。在战斗中有十余人死亡。在苏克·阿哈拉斯，“治安”部队同游击队也有冲突。
    在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡，最近几天在袭击事件中被击毙的有六人、击伤的有二十一人。殖民当局在卡萨布兰卡和摩洛哥的其他城市进行了大规模逮捕。
    巴黎“世界报”揭露：法国当局正当在和突尼斯进行关于“内政自治权”的谈判的时候，对北非、特别是对突尼斯采取武装镇压的政策。“世界报”说：看来，法国政府在北非的首要任务是进行“清剿”。这家报纸在同一报道中说：突尼斯的法国当局从九月十九日开始，进行了一连串军事行动。据联合国十月二十六日收到的一次关于北非局势的提案所载数字，自从法国、突尼斯谈判在九月开始以来，已有差不多二百三十名突尼斯人“在法国军队不正当的惊人的侵略中”被杀害。
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：据巴黎报纸消息，阿尔及利亚的三个省仍处在紧张的局势中。报纸写道，约一千名拥有自动武器的阿尔及利亚起义农民占据着阿勒斯山区。其他地区也在发生武装冲突。
    法国当局继续采取各种措施镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动。大批增援部队在开往阿尔及利亚，其中有伞兵部队，宪兵，以及所谓“共和国保安队”。除了巴特那、汉塞拉等城镇外，当局又正在德培萨及其他城镇中进行大规模的搜查和逮捕。德培萨城和一个大镇阿里斯已宣布戒严。大批炮兵部队和坦克部队现在集中在巴特那。
    据“解放报”消息，阿尔及利亚的民主报纸“自由报”已被法国总督下令查封。法国殖民当局禁止了君士坦丁的工会会议。
    现在在阿尔及利亚的法国陆军次长雅克·薛瓦利埃十一月三日说，镇压阿勒斯山区的暴动要化
  “很多人力和时间”。
