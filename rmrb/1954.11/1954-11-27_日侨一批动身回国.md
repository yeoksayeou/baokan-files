    日侨一批动身回国
   【新华社天津二十六日电】愿意回国的在中国的日本侨民和越南红十字会委托中国红十字会协助回国的在越南民主共和国的日侨共六百零四人，于二十六日乘日本轮船“兴安丸”离开塘沽新港回日本。
    这批回国日侨临行前，中国红十字会天津市分会曾在新港码头举行了送别式。回国日侨代表石田敏雄在送别式上说：虽然现在我们要和中国人民分手，但是中日两国人民深厚的关系是牢不可破的。他代表全体回国日侨向中国红十字会天津市分会献旗致敬。来接日侨回国的日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会三团体代表古田诚一郎对中国红十字会协助日本侨民回国表示感谢。接着，中国红十字会天津市分会总干事吴士法致词。他说：日侨在中国和越南民主共和国，同中国人民、越南人民建立了深厚的友谊，希望日侨把这种友谊带回日本。送别式结束后，回国日侨在甲板上频频举手挥帽表示惜别。
