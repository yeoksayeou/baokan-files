Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 23rd. Our frontline reporter reports: Under the continuous bombardment and shelling by our People's Liberation Army, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Yijiangshan Island, and Pishan Island are extremely panicked.

	During the day, there is not a single person to be seen in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' positions on these islands. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops are like frightened birds. As soon as they hear the sound of motors or other noises, they are scared and rush into air-raid shelters. One early morning, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship anchored in Da'ao Bay on Dachen Island started its engine. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit infantry stationed nearby, upon hearing the warship's engine, mistakenly thought it was a plane of our People's Air Force and immediately fell into chaos. Some didn't even bother to put on their shirts and desperately rushed into the air-raid shelters. One night, the wind and waves were very strong, and small reefs at sea were sometimes submerged in the water and sometimes exposed. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, scared out of their wits, mistakenly thought these small reefs were warships of our People's Liberation Army and frantically shelled them. At 7:20 on the 21st, when two Chiang Kai-shek F-47 aircraft flew over the vicinity of Dachen Island, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the island were so frightened that they fled in all directions. Those who did not have time to run hurriedly lay down on the ground. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops' anti-aircraft guns on the island also fired at these two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft from all directions until the two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft flew south.

    在解放军不断轰炸和炮击下
    大陈岛等岛上蒋贼军很惊慌
    【新华社浙江前线二十三日电】本社前线记者报道：在我人民解放军不断轰炸和炮击下，盘踞在大陈岛、渔山列岛、一江山岛和披山岛等岛屿上的蒋贼军十分惊慌。
    白天，这些岛上的蒋贼军阵地上没有一个人影。蒋贼军像惊弓之鸟，他们一听到马达和其他声响，就吓得往防空洞里钻。一天清早，停泊在大陈岛大岙里的蒋贼军舰发动了机器，驻在当地附近的蒋贼军步兵一听到军舰的马达声，又以为是我人民空军的飞机来了，马上混乱起来，有的连上衣也没顾得穿上，拚命地向防空洞里钻。有一天晚上，风浪很大，海上的小礁时而没入水中，时而露出水面。吓破了胆的蒋贼军，却以为这些小礁是我人民解放军的舰艇，就惊慌地对着它们打起炮来。二十一日七时二十分，蒋贼F—47型飞机二架飞到大陈岛附近上空时，岛上的蒋贼军吓得四处乱逃，来不及跑的慌忙卧倒地上。岛上蒋贼军的高射炮也从四处向这两架蒋贼飞机开炮射击，一直打到这两架蒋贼飞机向南飞去为止。
