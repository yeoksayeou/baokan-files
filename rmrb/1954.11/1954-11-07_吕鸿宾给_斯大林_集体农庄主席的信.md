Lü Hongbin's Letter to the Chairman of the "Stalin" Collective Farm
To Comrade Lisgen, Chairman of the "Stalin" Collective Farm, Stavropol Territory, Russian Soviet Republic:

　　The summer of 1952 was the most unforgettable summer of my life. At that time, as a representative of Chinese farmers, I had the honor of visiting your great country and, on May 25th, meeting you and the members of the "Stalin" Collective Farm under your leadership, receiving your warm hospitality. Your enthusiasm still moves me today, two years later. Your magnificent power station on the tributary of the Kuban River, your boundless and abundant wheat fields, constantly inspire my work enthusiasm. Your happy life has also become the driving force for our cooperative members to build a socialist society. As the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution arrives, please accept my warm regards. I wish you and all members of the "Stalin" Collective Farm good health and even greater success in production!

　　Dear Comrade, in the two years since I returned to China, our great motherland has changed greatly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. On the agricultural front, due to the development of mutual aid and cooperation, your advanced experiences have blossomed and borne fruit here. In the autumn of 1952, when our cooperative expanded to 59 households, we experienced some confusion in labor organization and work-point accounting due to our lack of leadership experience. After I returned, I gradually implemented your methods of organizing production and piece-rate wages, based on our actual conditions; the cultivated land was divided into production areas, the labor force was organized into production teams, and the cooperative's cadres were more rationally divided into labor, implementing a system of specific responsibilities. In this way, we quickly overcame the shortcomings of the past. Now our cooperative has expanded to 125 households, and all work is proceeding smoothly. Since the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members has been greatly improved, overcoming certain problems of loafing and waste, and truly achieving equal pay for equal work for men and women, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of women. This year, the labor days performed by female cooperative members accounted for 22.5% of the total agricultural labor in the cooperative.

　　Our cooperative has not only learned from your experience in management and achieved results; we have also increased production by adopting your close planting method in agricultural technology. This year, our 301.5 mu of closely planted wheat achieved a large-scale high yield of 217 jin per mu, more than 45% higher than ordinary wheat fields. We planted 45 mu of cotton using the close planting method on thin mountain land, and some people ridiculed us, saying, "Planting so densely will suffocate the rabbits." However, after overcoming various insect pests and severe droughts, we still harvested an average of more than 110 jin of cotton per mu. Local elderly people said, "This is the first time I've seen such a bumper harvest!" Those who made jokes are now also asking the cooperative members about the close planting method for cotton.

　　Dear Comrade, under the premise of doing a good job in agricultural production, we have also begun to learn your methods of developing diversified economies. This has also increased our income. This year, our 50 pigs raised for their bristles yielded a net profit of nearly 10 million yuan. The income from the carpentry team, transportation team, etc., is more than 20 million yuan. The trees in the newly opened orchard and mulberry garden this year are growing very well. Now that winter is approaching, our cooperative members have put forward the slogan "Turn winter leisure into winter work." In addition to strengthening the management of more than 620 mu of wheat fields and all 500+ mu of fallow land with autumn plowing, we are also vigorously carrying out soil improvement work, transforming more than 100 mu of sandy and sticky land into fertile fields. At the same time, we plan to expand sideline production that is beneficial to agriculture, increasing the number of pigs raised for their bristles by more than 100, building a lime kiln, a flour mill, planting 3,000 more fruit trees and 100 grape trellises, and establishing a small nursery to cultivate 20,000 tree seedlings in order to expand the area of afforestation.

　　We are not only learning from your advanced production experience, but your spirit of patriotism and internationalism, as well as the idea of collectivism, have also had a huge impact on our cooperative members. The cooperative members often say, "In the process of building socialism, Soviet farmers save on food and clothing and set aside a large amount of grain and cotton to support the country's industrial construction; if we want to achieve agricultural mechanization as soon as possible, we must do the same!" Therefore, although some of our crops were affected by disasters this year, the cooperative members still actively sold more than 180,000 jin of grain, part of the cotton, and 54 fat pigs to the state to support the liberation of Taiwan and industrial construction.

　　The cooperative members' idea of "taking the cooperative as their home" is also constantly growing. During the autumn harvest, some cooperative members picked up the fallen bean pods one by one and sent them to the cooperative. The cooperative members also displayed the spirit of unity and fraternity. This spring, several households that had just joined the cooperative and were short of grain were actively lent rice and firewood by the old cooperative members. This summer, some areas of our county suffered hailstorms, and the cooperative members sent a condolence group, bringing various seeds. Tian Zhongting, a household that was short of grain this spring, now has surplus grain to sell. Farmers from disaster-stricken areas also wrote letters saying, "We guarantee to sell tens of thousands of jin of surplus grain to the state!"

　　Dear Comrade Lisgen! Our cooperative members clearly know that the close unity of all the Chinese people is a strong force for our country's socialist construction; the unity of 800 million people in China and the Soviet Union is a bastion for defending world peace. Recently, when I saw the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks in the newspaper, I was truly overjoyed and grateful. This is another great manifestation of the Soviet Union's sincere assistance to our country and the close friendship between our two countries. At the same time, your government delegation also presented us with machines and equipment that can equip a large state-owned grain farm with 300,000 mu of cultivated land. When this news reached our cooperative, the cooperative members were all delighted. Old cooperative member Liu Yi said, "With such a good elder brother, how can we be afraid of failing to build socialism!" With your help, we must work harder to build our country into a great socialist country!

　　With the highest friendly greetings!

　　Lü Hongbin, Director of the Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative of Ju County, Shandong Province

### 吕鸿宾给“斯大林”集体农庄主席的信

    吕鸿宾给“斯大林”集体农庄主席的信苏联俄罗斯共和国斯达夫罗波尔边区“斯大林”集体农庄亲爱的里斯根同志：
    一九五二年的夏天，是我最难忘的一个夏天。那时，我以一个中国农民代表的身份，荣幸地到了你们的伟大的祖国，在五月二十五日那天，会见了你和你所领导的“斯大林”集体农庄的庄员们，受到你们的热诚的招待。你们的热情，一直到两年后的今天，还在感动着我。你们那库班河支流上的雄伟的发电站，你们那一望无际的丰盛的麦田，经常在鼓舞着我的工作热情。你们那幸福的生活，也成了我们社员建设社会主义社会的动力。当伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年到来的时候，请接受我的热烈的敬礼。祝贺你和“斯大林”集体农庄全体庄员们身体健康，生产上获得更大胜利！
    亲爱的同志，我回国后的两年里，我们伟大的祖国，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在苏联大公无私的援助下，又大大地变了样。在农业战线上，由于互助合作的发展，你们的先进经验已在这里开花结果了。一九五二年秋天，我们社扩大到五十九户的时候，由于我们缺乏领导的经验，在劳力组织和记工算账方面，有一个时期有些混乱。我回来后，就把你们组织生产和按件计工的办法，根据我们的实际情况，逐渐试行；把耕地划分了生产区，劳力组成了生产队，社内干部更合理地分了工，实行了专责制。这样，很快就克服了过去的缺点。现在我们的社已扩大到了一百二十五户，各项工作仍能顺利地进行。实行了按件计工的办法以后，大大地提高了社员的劳动积极性，克服了某些窝工浪费的毛病，而且真正作到了男女同工同酬，大大地鼓舞了妇女的劳动热情。女社员们今年做的劳动日，已占全社农业工的百分之二十二点五。
    我们社不单在经营管理上吸取你们的经验，取得了成绩；在农业技术上，采用了你们的密植法，也增加了产量。今年我们密植的三百零一亩半小麦，获得了每亩二百一十七斤的大面积丰产，比一般的麦田多百分之四十五以上。我们在山岭薄地用密植法种了四十五亩棉花，有的人讥笑我们说：“种那么稠，能夹死兔子。”可是，我们在战胜了各种虫灾和严重的旱灾之后，每亩平均还摘了一百一十多斤棉花。当地老年人说：“头一回看见这样的丰收！”那些说俏皮话的人，也在向社员们打听棉花的密植办法了。
    亲爱的同志，我们在搞好农业生产的前提下，也开始学习你们发展多种经济的办法了。这也增加了我们的收入。今年我们放牧的五十头毛猪，纯收益近一千万元。木匠组、运输队等收入在两千万元以上。今年新开辟的果树园和桑树园的树木，生长得很好。现在将要进入冬季了，我们社员提出“变冬闲为冬忙”的口号，除加强六百二十多亩麦田的管理和五百多亩休耕地全部秋耕外，并大力进行改良土壤的工作，要把一百多亩沙土地和粘土地，全部改造成良田。同时计划扩大有利于农业的副业生产，放牧的毛猪再增加一百头以上，设石灰窑一座，粉房一处，再栽果树三千株、葡萄一百架，设小苗圃一个、育树苗两万棵，以便扩大封山造林面积。
    我们不单学习你们的先进生产经验，你们的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，以及集体主义的思想，也在我们社员中发生了巨大的影响。社员们时常这样说：“苏联的农民在建设社会主义的过程中，省吃俭用，省下大批的粮棉支援国家工业建设；我们要想早日实现农业的机械化，也得这样做！”因此，今年我们虽有部分作物受了灾，社员们仍积极把十八万多斤粮食、部分棉花、五十四口肥猪卖给国家，支援解放台湾、支援工业建设。
    社员们“以社为家”的思想，也不断在成长。在收秋中，有的社员把掉下来的豆角，一个个拾起，送到社里去。社员们也发挥了团结友爱的精神。今春有几户才入社的缺粮户，老社员就主动借米借柴给他们。今年夏天我们县部分地区遭受了雹灾，社员就派去了慰问团，送去了各种种籽。今春的缺粮户田中廷现在也有余粮卖了。受灾地区的农民弟
  兄也来信说：“保证把上万斤的余粮卖给国家！”
    亲爱的里斯根同志！我们社员清楚地知道：全
  中国人民的亲密的团结，是我国建设社会主义的雄厚力量；中苏两国八万万人民的团结，是保卫世界持久和平的堡垒。最近当我在报上看到了中苏两国会谈的公报时，我真有说不出来的高兴和感激。这是苏联对我国真诚的援助和我们两国亲密友谊的又一伟大的表现。同时，你们政府代表团又赠送给我们能装备一个拥有三十万亩耕地的大型国营谷物农场的机器和设备。当这个消息传到我们社里时，社员们个个欢欣鼓舞。老社员刘义说：“咱有这样的好大哥，还怕社会主义建设不成吗！”在你们的帮助下，我们要进一步努力，为把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
    此致
    崇高的友谊敬礼！
    山东省莒县爱国农业生产合作社社长  吕鸿宾
