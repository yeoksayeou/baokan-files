Qiqihar Municipal People's Government Grain Bureau began organizing various oil factories to study Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction experience in October, and significant results have been achieved by early November. The average oil yield per hundred catties of soybeans in various oil factories has reached more than fourteen catties, with the highest reaching fifteen catties and two taels (pure oil). According to the state's processing plan for November and December, and based on the state-stipulated target of twelve catties of oil per hundred catties of soybeans, more than 133,000 catties of soybean oil can be produced in these two months.

Before learning Li Chuanjiang's advanced experience, state-owned, joint state-private, and private oil factories in Qiqihar City could only produce an average of eleven catties and five taels and six qian of oil per hundred catties of soybeans from January to September this year. Private oil factories had the lowest oil yield, only ten catties and nine taels and eight qian per hundred catties of soybeans, causing great losses to the state. In order to increase the soybean oil yield, the Grain Bureau organized study tour groups in early October (with technicians and management cadres from state-owned and joint state-private oil factories participating) to visit oil factories in Benxi, Shenyang, and other places, and especially to learn advanced oil extraction methods from Li Chuanjiang in Siping City. Subsequently, the Grain Bureau also transferred production section chiefs, workshop directors, and private oil factory directors from state-owned and joint state-private oil factories for intensive training. After such study, the oil yield of each factory gradually increased, and significant results were achieved by early November. At present, the enthusiasm of workers in various oil factories for learning Li Chuanjiang's advanced experience is generally high, and a production increase and economy drive is being further launched.

    齐齐哈尔各油厂积极学习李川江制油经验
    【本报讯】齐齐哈尔市人民政府粮食局从十月份开始组织各油厂学习李川江制油先进经验，到十一月上旬已取得显著成绩。各油厂每百斤大豆的出油率平均已达到十四斤以上，最高的已达到十五斤二两（纯油）。根据国家十一、十二两个月的加工计划，并按照国家规定的每百斤大豆出油十二斤的指标计算，这两个月可增产豆油十三万三千多斤。
    齐齐哈尔市国营、公私合营和私营油厂没有学习李川江先进经验以前，在今年一至九月份，每百斤大豆平均只能出油十一斤五两六钱，私营油厂出油率最低，每百斤大豆只能出油十斤九两八钱，给国家造成很大的损失。粮食局为了提高大豆出油率，在十月初组织了参观学习小组（有国营和公私合营油厂技术工人和管理干部参加），到本溪、沈阳等地油厂参观，特别是到四平市向李川江学习了先进制油方法。接着，粮食局还抽调了国营和公私合营油厂的生产股长、车间主任，以及私营油厂厂长等集中训练。经过这样学习，各厂出油率逐步提高，到十一月初就取得了显著成绩。目前，各油厂工人学习李川江先进经验的情绪普遍高涨，正进一步展开增产节约竞赛。
