    Over-fulfilling the October Cotton Purchase Plan
    By October 28th, Shaanxi Province had over-fulfilled its October cotton purchase plan by 6.2%. The province's cotton purchase was 25% higher than the same period last year. In October, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Shaanxi Provincial branch sent cadres to key cotton purchase units to inspect and supervise the purchase work. State-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies in various localities closely cooperated with supply and marketing cooperatives to widely publicize the unified cotton purchase policy to farmers, encouraging cotton farmers to sell new cotton in large quantities according to the state plan. After mid-October, the amount of cotton on the market increased daily. During the cotton purchase period, state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies gave priority to meeting the supply and marketing cooperatives' cotton cloth purchase plans and, in light of the actual situation after the cotton cloth supply plan, allocated a certain amount of seasonal commodities to the supply and marketing cooperatives to help them improve their operations and fully complete their sales plans.

    Cotton Purchase Task Nearing Completion
    Suining Prefecture, where cotton production accounts for a quarter of the total in Sichuan Province, had completed 93.6% of its cotton purchase task by October 15th. Lezhi, Santai, Shehong, and Suining counties had already over-fulfilled their tasks.

    The cotton farmers who have reaped a bumper harvest regard "selling patriotic cotton" as a gift to the country's industrialization. The amount of cotton purchased in Suining Prefecture increased from more than 100,000 jin per day in early August to 600,000 to 700,000 jin. In many areas, such as Guihua Township in Suining County, farmers selling cotton lined up in long queues in front of the cotton purchasing stations at dawn. On October 16th alone, cotton farmers in more than a dozen villages in the third district of Pengxi County collectively sold more than 30,000 jin of cotton.

    Now, tens of thousands of dan of cotton are being transported to Chongqing, Hechuan, and other places to supply textile factories for production. (Our Sichuan Reporter Station)

    Taking the Lead in Collective Cotton Sales
    The Xiliang Township Agricultural Production United Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, is composed of seven agricultural production cooperatives. After the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative proposed a collective cotton sales plan to sell 150,000 jin of seed cotton to the state, the other six cooperatives also formulated plans to actively sell cotton in accordance with state regulations.

    When formulating the plans, they estimated the yield and reasonably reserved cotton for their own use. The members of the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative believed that leaving too much cotton unused was a waste, and they all voluntarily reduced the amount of cotton reserved for their own use. Zhu Guang'an, the deputy director, decided not to keep a single jin of cotton and sell it all to the state because he did not need cotton this year. The entire united cooperative planned to collectively sell more than 522,000 jin of seed cotton to the state.

    On the morning of October 20th, these seven agricultural production cooperatives organized 169 people, driving 69 large carts loaded with seed cotton, to the state cotton purchasing station. In the two-li-long procession, they carried the banner of "Xiliang Township Agricultural Production United Cooperative Collective Cotton Sales Team"; the cotton carts were covered with red and green slogans, reading "Save cotton for our own use, strive to sell more cotton to the state," "Produce more and sell more cotton, support the country's socialist industrialization." This time, they sold a total of more than 38,800 jin of seed cotton to the state. The money they got from selling cotton was actively used to expand production or participate in savings. The Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative alone had already used more than 13 million yuan from cotton sales to buy waterwheels. (Liu Peitang, He Ying, etc.)

    Finding Ways to Increase Income and Save Cotton
    The broad masses of cotton farmers in Qingping County, Shandong Province, are adopting various methods to increase income and save cotton, selling more cotton to the state. The Cangshang Zhou Qingtang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the first district and the seven agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangzhuang Township in the third district have formulated a cotton picking pact: "Pick up all the fallen flowers in the field, pick up all the fluff on the calyxes, and keep the cotton bags clean." By doing this alone, the Zhou Qingtang Agricultural Production Cooperative can increase its cotton income by more than 470 jin. The 18 members of the Zhang He Zhuang Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in the third district used inferior cotton or old cotton to make cotton clothes this autumn in order to sell more good cotton to the state. In order to improve the quality of cotton, the Gaozhuang Township General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in the second district of Qingping County organized 16 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 30 year-round mutual aid groups in the township to promote experiences such as pruning empty branches, removing old leaves, pruning group tips, and picking tender peaches. It is estimated that as a result, 24,000 jin of frost-damaged flowers will be turned into white flowers before frost throughout the township. Under the slogan of "pick and dry, pick and sell," the cotton farmers in Gaozhuang Township did not build any cotton stacks at home, and they sent the dried cotton to the cotton collection points as soon as it was harvested. The township has already quickly sold more than 60,000 jin of harvested cotton to the state. According to statistics in early October, the county can purchase more than 100,000 jin of seed cotton every day.

    Ginning Workers Launch Competition
    After the order for planned cotton purchase was announced, the amount of cotton on the market in Henan Province increased significantly. In some areas, the processing work could not keep up, and a large amount of seed cotton was backlogged for a time. Under the leadership of the Party Committee and the government, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels actively organized processing forces. In late September, the province newly organized 7,745 ginning machines. In early October, the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a provincial cotton processing plant conference to exchange advanced processing experience.

    In order to improve processing efficiency, ginning factory workers in various parts of Henan launched a labor competition to ensure "fast ginning, fast packaging, and fast transportation," and to ensure quality, ensure safe production, and prevent accidents. (Yao Funian)

    Adjusting Cloth Coupons
    In early October, the staff of the Southwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company conducted organized adjustment of cloth coupons, so that cloth coupons were used reasonably and better met the needs of all employees of the company for cotton cloth.

    Because each employee's clothing needs are different and each employee's income is different, some employees of the company cannot use up their cloth coupons, and some employees need more cloth coupons. Based on this situation, the company's leadership organized employees to adjust cloth coupons. The company's trade union first explained the significance of adjusting cloth coupons to all employees, so that it could better meet the needs of each employee for cotton cloth and promote the comprehensive completion of the state's cotton cloth supply plan. Each trade union group then organized employees to discuss and calculate carefully, and on the basis of voluntary participation, decided on the number of coupons they would transfer out or transfer in in a realistic manner; finally, in the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, the adjustment was made by means of gifting or borrowing. After reasonable adjustment, the company's cloth coupons were still slightly surplus.

    Preparing Cloth According to Consumer Needs
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the planned cotton cloth supply work, in addition to allocating 350,000 bolts of cotton cloth to various regions in August, the Guangxi Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company recently continued to allocate a batch of cloth of different colors and varieties to various regions according to the different needs of consumers in various regions, further enriching the inventory of grassroots sales units.

    Since the first quarter of this year, the Guangxi Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company system has been conducting business communication network work in a planned manner, and has preliminarily grasped the changes in the needs of consumers in various regions for cotton cloth colors and varieties. After the implementation of unified cotton cloth sales, the Guangxi Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company imported a large number of cotton cloth according to the preferences of consumers in various regions. For example, the amount of deep Shilin cloth imported in September this year increased by 43% compared with the same period last year, flower tribute increased by 79.7%, flower Baji increased by 11.8%, and other items such as khaki, Hwadani, corduroy, and bed sheet cloth also increased. When allocating cloth to various regions, attention was paid to the living habits of the people in various regions. For example, blue khaki, deep Shilin, and Hwadani were transferred to the Pingle mining area, clamped Shilin and blue coarse cloth were transferred to rural areas, white cloth, blue cloth, and Maoqing cloth were transferred to the Baise area to supply ethnic minorities, and Baji and Shilin cloth were transferred to the Qinzhou area to supply fishermen.

    贯彻棉布统购统销和棉花统购的政策
    超额完成十月份购棉计划
    陕西省十月份棉花收购计划，到二十八日就超额百分之六点二完成了。全省收购的棉花比去年同期多了百分之二十五。十月份中国花纱布公司陕西省公司曾陆续派出干部，深入棉花重点收购单位检查和督促收购工作。各地国营花纱布公司密切配合供销合作社，向农民广泛宣传棉花统购政策，鼓励种棉农民们按照国家计划大量出售新棉，十月中旬以后，棉花上市量日益增加。在收购棉花期间，各地国营花纱布公司尽先满足供销合作社的棉布进货计划，并结合棉布计划供应后的实际情况，分配给供销合作社一定数量的季节性商品，帮助供销合作社改进业务，全力完成销售计划。（新华社）
    购棉任务即将完成
    棉产量占四川全省四分之一的遂宁专区，到十月十五日止，已经完成棉花收购任务百分之九十三点六，乐至、三台、射洪、遂宁等县已经超额完成任务。
    获得丰收的棉农们，把“售爱国棉”作为给国家工业化的献礼。遂宁专区棉花收购量，由八月初的每天十万多斤增加到六、七十万斤。在遂宁县桂花乡等许多地区，天刚放亮，卖棉的农民就在棉花收购站的门前排成长长的队伍。十月十六日一天，蓬溪县第三区十几个村的棉农就集体售棉三万多斤。
    现在，成万担的棉花正源源运往重庆、合川等地，供应纺织厂生产。（本报四川记者站）
    带头集体卖棉
    山西省翼城县西梁乡农业生产联合社是由七个农业生产合作社组成的。在吴春安农业生产合作社提出要卖给国家十五万斤籽棉的集体售棉计划以后，其他六个社也都订出计划，按照国家规定踊跃出售棉花。
    在订计划的时候，他们估计了产量，合理地留出了自用棉。吴春安农业生产合作社的社员们认为留的棉花多了，闲放着是一种浪费，都自动减少了留用棉花的数量；副社长朱广安因为今年不需要棉花，决定一斤也不留全部卖给国家。全联社准备集体卖给国家籽棉五十二万二千多斤。
    十月二十日的早晨，这七个农业生产合作社组织一百六十九个人，赶着六十九辆大车，满载着籽棉，送到国家的棉花收购站。在长达二里路的行列里，打着“西梁乡农业生产联合社集体售棉大队”的旗子；装棉车上贴满了红绿标语，写着“节约自用棉，争取把更多的棉花卖给国家”、“多增产多卖棉，支援国家社会主义工业化”。这一次，他们一共卖给国家三万八千八百多斤籽棉。卖棉得到的钱，他们都积极用来扩大生产或参加储蓄。仅吴春安农业生产合作社就已经用一千三百多万元卖棉款买了水车。  （刘培棠、贺英等）
    设法增收和节省棉花
    山东省清平县广大棉农采取各种方法增收和节省棉花，把更多的棉花卖给国家。第一区仓上周庆堂农业生产合作社和第三区相庄乡七个农业生产合作社，制订了“地里落花要拣净，萼上毛眼要拾净，拾棉包里要干净”的拾棉公约。仅周庆堂农业生产合作社这样做以后，就可以增收棉花四百七十多斤。第三区张贺庄先锋农业生产合作社十八户社员，今秋做棉衣都是用的次棉或旧棉，以便卖给国家更多的好棉花。为了提高棉花的质量，中共清平县第二区高庄乡总支委会组织全乡十六个农业生产合作社和三十多个常年互助组推广了剪空枝、打老叶、剪群尖、摘嫩桃等经验，预计全乡将因此有两万四千斤霜后花变成霜前白花。高庄乡棉农在“随收随晒、随拣随卖”的口号下，家中都没搭花垛，收下来晒干就送往收棉点。全乡已经把收下来的六万多斤棉花迅速卖给了国家。据十月上旬统计，全县每天可收购籽棉十万多斤。
    轧花工人展开竞赛
    实行棉花计划收购的命令公布以后，河南省棉花上市量增加很多。有些地区一度出现了加工工作赶不上、籽棉大量积压的现象。各地供销合作社在党委、政府领导下，积极组织加工力量。九月下旬，全省新组织轧花车七千七百四十五部。十月上旬，河南省供销合作总社召开了全省棉花加工厂会议，交流了先进的加工经验。
    为了提高加工效率，河南各地轧花厂工人展开了劳动竞赛，保证“快轧，快打包，快起运”，并要保证质量，保证安全生产，不出事故。  （姚福年）
    调剂购布票
    十月上旬，中国花纱布公司西南区公司的职工们有组织地进行了购布票的调剂工作，使购布票得到了合理的使用，更好地满足了该公司全体职工对棉布的需要。
    由于每个职工对衣着的需要不一样，每个职工的收入不同，该公司有些职工购布票用不完，有的职工需要较多一些的购布票。公司领导方面根据这一情况，组织职工们进行了购布票调剂工作。该公司工会首先向全体职工说明了调剂购布票的意义，这样既能更好地满足每个职工对棉布的需要，又可以促进国家棉布供应计划的全面完成。各工会小组随即组织职工讨论、算细账，在自觉自愿的基础上，实事求是地决定自己调出或调入的数字；最后，本着互助友爱的精神，采取赠送或借用的方式进行调剂。经过合理调剂以后，全公司的购布票还稍有富裕。
    根据消费者需要准备布匹
    中国花纱布公司广西省公司为了保证棉布计划供应工作的顺利进行，除在八月份调拨给各地三十五万匹棉布外，最近继续根据各地消费者不同的需要，调给各地一批不同花色品种的布匹，进一步充实了基层销货单位的库存。
    广西省花纱布公司系统从今年第一季度起，就有计划地开展了业务通讯网的工作，初步摸到了各地消费者对棉布花色品种需要的变化情况。实行棉布统销以后，中国花纱布公司广西省公司根据各地消费者的爱好，调进大批棉布。如今年九月份调进的深士林布，比去年同期增加百分之四十三，花贡呢增加百分之七十九点七，花哔叽增加百分之十一点八，其他如卡其、华达呢、条绒、被单布等也都有所增加。在往各地调拨布匹时，注意照顾了各地人民的生活习惯。如调往平乐工矿区的有蓝卡其、深士林、华达呢，调运农村的有夹士林、蓝粗布，调往百色地区供应少数民族的有白布、蓝布、毛青布，调往钦州地区供应渔民的有哔叽、士林布等。
