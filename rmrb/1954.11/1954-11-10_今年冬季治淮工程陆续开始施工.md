    Winter Huai River Project Construction Commences Sequentially This Year

    Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, November 9th: Winter Huai River projects in various areas along the Huai River will commence sequentially from November 10th. The focus of this winter's Huai River project is to repair riverbank levees and auxiliary structures; and to continue the construction of the unfinished Nanwan Reservoir project, the Nihe Depression flood storage project, the second phase of the Fen River improvement project in the upper reaches, and the Meishan Reservoir project in the middle reaches.

    During this year's flood season, the Huai River was impacted by extraordinarily large floods, resulting in collapses, cracks, and leaks in some riverbank levees; many small culverts and sluices also suffered considerable damage from the floods. These all need to be repaired, reinforced, and strengthened promptly. For this purpose, the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China has allocated special funds amounting to 450 billion yuan. Since September, the Huai River Commission has been leading the Huai River organizations at all levels to carry out preparations for the winter Huai River project. The survey team of 2,300 people sent by the Huai River Commission has completed the measurement of the Wei River levee, the Huaibei levee from Zhengyangguan to Bogang section, the Xifei River levee, and the enclosing dikes of Bengbu and Huainan cities. The key regions in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River have also largely completed the surveying and exploration work for the construction; some units have also prepared construction plans. Steel, wood, oil, cement, and other materials needed for the project are being transported from various places to the construction site; 40 percent of the materials needed for the entire winter project have been delivered. Some of the migrant workers along the Huai River who have signed up to participate in this winter's project have already formed teams and rushed to the construction site.

    今年冬季治淮工程陆续开始施工
    【新华社蚌埠九日电】沿淮各地的冬季治淮工程十一月十日起将先后开工。今年冬季治淮工程重点是修复河岸堤防和附属建筑物；继续修建上游未完工的南湾水库工程、泥河洼地蓄洪工程、汾河第二期整理工程以及中游的梅山水库工程。
    今年汛期内，淮河经特大洪水的冲击，以致某些河岸堤防有塌坡、裂缝、漏水现象；不少小型涵闸也遭受了洪水的相当的破坏。这些都需要及时修复，培实加固。为此，中华人民共和国水利部所拨的专款达四千五百亿元。九月以来，治淮委员会即领导各级治淮机构进行冬季治淮的准备工作。治淮委员会派出的两千三百人的测量队，测完了涡河河堤、正阳关到泊岗段的淮北大堤、西淝河河堤，蚌埠和淮南两市的圈堤。淮河上游河南省各重点专区大体上也已完成了施工的测量、勘查工作；有些单位并已做好施工计划。工程需用的钢料、木料、油料、水泥等正从各地向工地赶运中；整个冬季工程需用的物资已运到百分之四十。淮河沿线报名参加今冬工程的民工，有的已整队赶往工地。
