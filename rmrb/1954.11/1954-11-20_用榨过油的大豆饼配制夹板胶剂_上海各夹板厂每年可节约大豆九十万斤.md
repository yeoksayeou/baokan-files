Shanghai's plywood factories are promoting the method of using soybean cake flour to prepare adhesives. It is estimated that after all state-owned, joint state-private, and private plywood factories in the city fully adopt soybean cake flour for adhesive production, they can save 900,000 jin of soybeans annually. Simultaneously, because the cost of soybean cake flour adhesive is 11,000 yuan lower per 100 jin than soybean adhesive, it can also reduce costs by 99 million yuan annually. In the past, the adhesive used for plywood was always made from soybeans, because the protein in soybeans has viscosity after dissolving. However, soybeans contain a large amount of oil. If it is not refined, it will not only affect the bonding effect and plywood quality, but also waste a lot of valuable oil. Now, using soybean cake flour to make adhesive, because the oil has already been extracted, its moisture resistance and tensile strength are stronger than soybean adhesive. Therefore, it not only reduces costs, but also improves the quality of the plywood.

    用榨过油的大豆饼配制夹板胶剂
    上海各夹板厂每年可节约大豆九十万斤
    上海市各夹板厂正在推广用豆饼粉配制胶剂的方法。估计全市国营、公私合营及私营夹板厂全面使用豆饼粉制胶后，每年可节约大豆九十万斤。同时，由于豆饼粉制胶成本较大豆制胶每百斤低一万一千元，所以，每年又可降低成本九千九百万元。过去胶合夹板用的胶剂一直都是用大豆制成的，因为大豆中的蛋白质溶解后有黏性。但大豆中含有大量油脂，如不经提炼，不仅影响胶合作用和夹板质量，而且也浪费许多宝贵的油料。现在用豆饼粉制胶，由于油脂已经提炼，其抗湿性、拉力等都较大豆制胶为强，因此，不但降低了成本，而且夹板质量也可提高。
