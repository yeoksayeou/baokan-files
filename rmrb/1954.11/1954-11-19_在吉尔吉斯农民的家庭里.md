    In the Home of a Kyrgyz Farmer
    By Li Nan, Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow
    It was almost sunset. We had been traveling in the Kyrgyz mountains for almost a day. The peaks on both sides were covered with snow, and at the foot of the mountains were fields of collective farms being harvested. Herds of grazing livestock frequently blocked our path.

    We left the main road and stopped at a threshing ground. A local comrade who had been traveling with us from Frunze told us, "Maybe the chairman of the collective farm is here. When the crops are being harvested, the chairman usually isn't sitting in the office."

    As this comrade predicted, we met Akesi Tulebekiyev, the chairman of the Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm, at the threshing ground. In accordance with the Kyrgyz custom of greeting people, the chairman placed his left hand on his chest, slightly bowed, and said, "The Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm of Przhevalsk Oblast welcomes guests from afar."

    We explained our purpose and hopes. When he heard that we wanted to understand the life of this collective farm from the perspective of a Kyrgyz collective farmer's family, Tulebekiyev immediately said, "That's much better than me broadly talking about various aspects of the farm. Well then, let's go to the home of Borbas Kenelbayev, or if not, to the home of Arikomar Ashabayev, the principal of the collective farm's school. Both are on the way and very convenient. Ashabayev's family is also a farmer's family."

    So, we went to Kenelbayev's home. The exterior of the house was very new and brightly painted; it could even be described as beautiful. The furnishings inside were exquisite, with electric lights, a radio, and a gramophone. We saw magnificent carpets, various kinds of bedding, and beautiful curtains.

    The Kenelbayev family consists of seven people. Kenelbayev and his wife, along with their second son and granddaughter, were at home. Soon, the eldest son also returned from the fields. Our group filled the entire room.

    We talked with Kenelbayev about when he joined the collective farm and about his life in the past and present. He said, "I joined the collective farm shortly after it was established in 1932. Before, my wife and I were both hired laborers, working for landlords and living a nomadic life." He then told us that after the October Revolution, he was allocated land, two cows, and more than ten sheep. In 1924, he built a house for himself and began to live a settled life.

    Building a house is a big event in the lives of Kyrgyz farmers. In the past, they could only live in tattered tents that barely sheltered them from the wind and rain, wandering everywhere. It was not until 1921 that the farmers near the Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm began to build houses for themselves, and it took more than ten years before there were no more people living in tents. Now, the Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm builds new houses every year. For example, this year alone, one or two dozen farmers are building houses. The newly built houses are, of course, much more beautiful than in the past.

    Talking about building a new house, Kenelbayev told us, "This house I have now was newly built in 1952. The reason is simple: I didn't want to live in the original mud-walled house anymore. If necessary, I only need to save for another two years, and I can build another house like this."

    "So, what is your family's total income?" we asked.

    "Taking this year as an example," the host replied, "So far, I myself have 400 workdays, and the whole family has 1,000 workdays. By the end of this year, our family's workdays will exceed 1,500. This year, each workday will be paid with five kilograms of grain and ten rubles in cash."

    "Don't forget your personal property," the chairman of the farm interjected.

    "We ourselves have a horse, two cows, fifteen sheep, fifty poultry, and an orchard-cum-vegetable garden. The income from these is also considerable, and the family's needs for milk, vegetables, etc. are fully met."

    Kenelbayev's family's annual consumption only accounts for a small portion of their grain income, and the remaining grain is sold to the state and cooperatives. There is also a lot of money left over. When we asked him how he spends this money, he replied:

    "We buy whatever we need." He pointed to a sewing machine in the corner of the room and said, "For example, this machine, I bought it in 1948. Although we don't use it often, it saves us a lot of trouble."

    There were a lot of things in the house. Even the walls were covered with felt carpets, which are the most beloved decorations in Kyrgyz farmers' homes. There were also many books on the bookshelf in the house.

    Kenelbayev was illiterate before the revolution, but now he can read newspapers and general books. His eldest son graduated from tenth grade, participated in the Great Patriotic War, and now works on the farm. The second son is studying at the Tashkent Printing Industry School; he is probably at home now because of the holidays.

    Before the revolution, almost all Kyrgyz farmers were illiterate, but now everyone has the opportunity to study. The Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm has a ten-year school. The chairman of the farm told us that the school has 250 students and 20 teachers. All subjects in the school are taught in the Kyrgyz language.

    Kyrgyz farmers also send their children to universities in Moscow, Tashkent, Frunze, and other places. After a few years, they return to their farms after completing their studies. Speaking of this, the chairman of the farm happily told us, "They all return to their farms. On the one hand, the farm needs all kinds of technical talents now; on the other hand, they are also unwilling to leave their farms and want to live together with their family and friends on the farm."

    The Jiangna Jurdes Collective Farm has a history of more than twenty years. The current chairman of the farm was the secretary of the Communist Youth League organization in those years. He clearly remembers that when the farm was first established, there were only 500 sheep, 100 cows, less than 100 horses, very little land, and no machines at all. The yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) of land was only a little more than two quintals.

    And now, this collective farm has 7,000 hectares of land, 7,000 sheep, nearly 1,000 cows, and nearly 700 horses. The farm has various economic and cultural facilities.

    More than twenty years ago, the farmers of this collective farm named their farm Jiangna Jurdes—New Star. This was not without reason. This new star shines on the Kyrgyz farmers, allowing them to forever get rid of poverty. The great Lenin pointed out this path for the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    After saying goodbye to the host, night had fallen on the way back. One after another, the lights shone from the windows of the Kyrgyz farmers' houses, and the music broadcast by the radio was heard.

    在吉尔吉斯农民的家庭里
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    时间已是将近日落时分。我们在吉尔吉斯的群山中已走了将近一天了。两旁连绵起伏的山顶上覆盖着皑皑的白雪，山脚下是一片片正在进行收获的集体农庄的土地。一群群放牧的牲畜不时阻拦了我们前进的道路。
    我们离开了大路，在一个打谷场上停了下来，从伏龙芝城出发就和我们一道的一个当地同志告诉我们：“也许集体农庄的主席就在这里，当收获庄稼的时候，农庄的主席照例是不会坐在办公室里的。”
    果然不出这位同志的预料，我们在打谷场上遇见了江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄主席阿克式·图列别基耶夫同志。依照吉尔吉斯人向人致意的习惯，这位农庄主席把左手放在胸前，微微倾侧着身子，说道：“普尔热瓦尔斯克州江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄欢迎远方的客人们。”
    我们说明了来意和希望。听说我们想从一家吉尔吉斯集体农民的家庭来了解这个集体农庄的生活时，图列别基耶夫立刻讲道：“这真比我笼统地讲农庄各方面的情况要强得多。那么，我们就到波尔巴式·肯德尔巴耶夫的家里去吧，再不然，到集体农庄中学校长阿里科马尔·阿夏巴耶夫家里去也可以。去这两家都很顺路，很方便。阿夏巴耶夫的家庭也是农民。”
    于是，我们就到了肯德尔巴耶夫的家园。这所房子的外表非常新，油漆得亮堂堂的，简直可以说很漂亮。房子里的陈设都很精致，电灯、收音机、留声机样样都有。我们看见华美的地毡，各色各样的被褥，漂亮的窗帘。
    肯德尔巴耶夫一家共有七口人。肯德尔巴耶夫夫妇同他们的次子和孙女都正在家里。不久，大儿子也从地里回来了。我们这群人就坐满了整整一屋子。
    我们同肯德尔巴耶夫谈起了他什么时候加入集体农庄，以及过去和现在的生活情况。他说：“我是一九三二年集体农庄成立后不久加入农庄的。从前，我和老婆都是雇农，给大地主作工，过着飘泊的生活。”他接着告诉我们，十月革命后，他才分到了土地，两头牛，十多只羊。一九二四年，他才为自己盖了房屋，开始过安定的生活。
    修建房屋在吉尔吉斯农民的生活中是件大事情。过去，他们只能住破烂的几乎不能遮蔽风雨的帐篷，到处流浪。一九二一年，江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄附近的农民才开始为自己盖房屋，过了十多年，才完全没有住帐篷的人。现在，江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄年年都在修建新住宅，比如今年一年就有一、二十家农民在修建房屋。新修的房屋，当然比过去漂亮得多。
    谈到修建新屋，肯德尔巴耶夫对我们说：“我现在这所房屋是一九五二年新修的。原因很简单，就是原来的泥墙房屋不想再住了。如果需要的话，我只要再储蓄两年，又可以再修一座这样的房屋。”
    “那么，你们全家的收入有多少呢？”我们问道。
    “拿今年说吧，”主人回答说，“到现在为止，我自己已有四百个劳动日，全家已有一千个劳动日。到今年年底，我们全家的劳动日会到一千五百个以上。今年每一个劳动日报酬将是五公斤谷物和十卢布现金。”
    “你不要忘记了你的个人财产”，农庄主席插了一句。
    “我们自己有一匹马、两头牛、十五只羊、五十只家禽和一块果园兼菜园。这上面的收入也很可观，而且全家需要的牛奶、蔬菜等等完全足够了。”
    肯德尔巴耶夫家一年的食用只占粮食收入中一小部分，剩余的粮食都卖给国家和合作社。剩下的钱也很多，我们问他怎样花这些钱时，他回答说：
  “需要什么就买什么。”他指给我们看放在屋角落的一架缝纫机说：“例如这部机器，这是我一九四八年买的，虽然我们不经常用它，但却给我们省去了不少麻烦。”
    屋子里的东西真不少，连四周墙壁上都挂着毡毯，这是吉尔吉斯农民家里最喜爱的装饰。屋内书架上也放着许多书籍。
    肯德尔巴耶夫革命前一字不识，现在已经能够阅读报纸和一般书籍了。他的大儿子在十年级中学毕业，参加过卫国战争，现在农庄工作。第二个儿子现在塔什干印刷工业学校读书；现在留在家中，大概是因为假期的缘故。
    革命前，吉尔吉斯农民几乎都不识字，现在每个人都有了学习的机会。江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄有一所十年制学校。农庄主席告诉我们，这个学校有二百五十个学生，二十个教员。学校中一切功课都是用吉尔吉斯语言讲授的。
    吉尔吉斯农民还把自己的子弟送到莫斯科、塔什干、伏龙芝等地的高等学校念书。经过几年以后，他们学成后都回到自己的农庄。谈到这儿，农庄主席愉快地对我们说：“他们都回到自己的农庄来。这一方面是由于农庄现在无论什么技术人才都用得着；二来他们也不愿意离开自己的农庄，都愿意和自己的家人亲友一道在农庄上共同生活。”
    江纳·朱尔德斯集体农庄已有二十多年的历史了。现在的农庄主席是当年共产主义青年团组织的书记，他还清楚地记得农庄初成立时只有五百只羊、一百头牛、不到一百匹马，土地很少，机器根本没有。每公顷（合十五市亩）土地的收成只有两公担多一点。
    而现在呢，这个集体农庄已有七千公顷土地，七千只羊、将近一千头牛和将近七百匹马了。农庄有各种经济的和文化生活的建筑设备。
    二十多年前，这个集体农庄的农民把自己的农庄命名为江纳·朱尔德斯——新的星，这不是没有理由的。这颗新的星照耀着吉尔吉斯农民，使他们永远摆脱贫困的境遇。伟大的列宁给苏联各族人民指出了这条道路。
    辞别了主人，在归途中，夜色已经降临了。一家接着一家，吉尔吉斯农民的窗户上照耀着电灯的光芒，传出了无线电收音机放送的音乐。
