The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1954, No. 43, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Raise the Ideological Level of Education within the Party." The editorial states that the reason why Communist and Workers' Parties are strong and invincible is that they use the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to guide all their activities. Party education is an effective way to arm party members with Marxist-Leninist theory. The task of party education is to help party cadres and all party members grasp the laws of development of human society, to help them profoundly understand the true scientific basis of the policies of Marxist parties; to raise the awareness and political vigilance of party members, to make them ideologically firm and principled, and to enable them to guide their specific work with revolutionary theory; and to constantly explain to party members the lofty goals of the proletarian struggle, and to inspire them to actively and selflessly fight for the cause of the working class and all working people.

The editorial then points out that Communist and Workers' Parties have accumulated rich experience in organizing party education, but there are still some shortcomings. One of the shortcomings of some party organizations of Communist and Workers' Parties in people's democratic countries in educational work is to study Marxist-Leninist theory with a scholastic and dogmatic attitude. Therefore, the Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries believe that their task is to improve the ideological and political level of education within the Party, to spread Marxism-Leninism in a vivid and convincing way, and to always link this work with economic and political tasks, with the international situation, and with the struggle for world peace. The party's education and propaganda work must arm party members to fight against class enemies, and must ruthlessly expose the various hostile "theories" of the bourgeoisie. The education and propaganda work of communist parties in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies must more deeply and vividly explain that communists are the most advanced and resolute fighters for national interests, explain the great significance of striving to further strengthen the ties between the working class and the peasants in these countries; and use concrete examples to explain the essence and significance of striving for the unity of the working class and uniting all progressive forces in the national united front.

This issue contains articles such as "The French People Oppose the Revival of German Militarism" by弗·皮佑, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and "The District Committee—an Important Link in the Party Organization" by 克·茵涅曼, Member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

皮佑's article points out that the vote of the French National Assembly on August 30 to reject the "European Defense Community" treaty clearly showed that the French people would not allow the revival of German militarism in any form. However, after the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, the most important thing for the US State Department was to find another way to revive German militarism in another way. Unfortunately, the French government is still helping the US ruling group achieve this goal and signed the London Agreement. Therefore, in the current struggle against the revival of German militarism and the unity of the working class with all peaceful forces and patriots to achieve victory in this struggle, it is still very important. The article goes on to say that more and more French people believe that what we need first is consultation with the Soviet Union, rather than seeking a way to revive German militarism at all costs. Therefore, favorable conditions exist for rejecting the London Agreement as did the rejection of the "European Defense Community." If we do our best to attract all national forces and patriotic forces to participate in the struggle, the London Agreement will also fail. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第四十三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第四十三期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“提高党内教育的思想水平”为题发表了社论。社论说，共产党和工人党之所以强大而不可战胜，是因为它们用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说来指导它们的一切活动。党内教育就是用马克思列宁主义学说把党员武装起来的有效办法。党内教育的任务是帮助党的干部和全体党员掌握人类社会发展的规律，帮助他们深刻地了解马克思主义政党的政策的真正科学的基础；提高党员的觉悟和政治警惕性，使他们思想坚定而有原则性，使他们善于以革命理论来指导自己的具体工作；不断地向党员阐明无产阶级斗争的崇高目标，并鼓舞他们积极地、忘我地为工人阶级和全体劳动人民的事业而奋斗。
    社论接着指出：共产党和工人党在组织党内教育方面已经积累了丰富的经验，但也还存在着若干缺点。各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党的一些党组织在教育工作中的缺点之一，就是以学究式的、教条主义的态度来学习马克思列宁主义理论。因此，这些国家的共产党和工人党认为自己的任务就是提高党内教育的思想水平和政治水平，以生动而有说服力的方式来传播马克思列宁主义，并使这种工作经常同经济任务和政治任务、同国际形势、同争取世界和平的斗争联系起来。党的教育和宣传工作必须把党员武装起来同阶级敌人作斗争，必须无情地揭穿资产阶级各种各样的敌对“理论”。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的共产主义政党的教育和宣传工作，必须更加深刻和生动地说明共产主义者是为民族利益而斗争的最先进、最坚决的战士，解释在这些国家的情况下争取进一步加强工人阶级和农民的联系的重大意义；用具体事例来解释争取工人阶级的团结、争取把一切进步力量团结在民族统一阵线里的实质和意义。
    这一期刊载的文章有法国共产党中央委员会书记处书记弗·皮佑的“法国人民反对复活德国军国主义”，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员克·茵涅曼的“区委员会——党机构的重要环节”等。
    皮佑的文章指出，八月三十日法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约的投票，明确地表示了法国人民不容许在任何形式下复活德国军国主义。但在法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约以后，美国国务院所最关心的事就是寻找另一条道路，用另一种方式来复活德国军国主义。不幸的是法国政府还在帮助美国统治集团达到这个目的，在伦敦协定上签了字。因此，在目前反对复活德国军国主义的斗争以及工人阶级同一切和平力量和爱国人士为取得这个斗争的胜利而团结一致，还是十分重要的。文章接着说：越来越多的法国人认为，我们所需要的首先是和苏联进行协商，而不是不惜一切代价寻找一种方式来复活德国军国主义。所以，像拒绝“欧洲防务集团”那样拒绝伦敦协定的有利条件是存在着的。如果我们尽最大的力量吸引所有的民族力量和爱国力量参加斗争，伦敦协定是同样会遭到失败的。（新华社）
