Following the implementation of the planned supply of edible oil, the supply of edible oil for the people of Beijing and Tianjin has been guaranteed. Since liberation, with the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the consumption of edible oil products has also increased year by year. In 1953, the annual sales volume of edible oil by state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private commerce in Beijing increased by 122.02 percent compared with 1950; Tianjin's edible oil sales volume in 1953 increased by 78.91 percent compared with 1950. This shows that the growth rate of edible oil consumption is very rapid. In addition, the speculation activities of illegal private oil merchants, such as hoarding, refusing to sell, raising prices, adulterating, and transferring goods to other places, once caused chaos in the edible oil market, and many citizens could not buy oil. After the implementation of the planned supply of edible oil in March this year, the state took control of the oil and fat market, cracked down on the speculative activities of private merchants, and ensured the normal supply of edible oil. Most of Beijing's 56 private oil factories and oil workshops process oil for the state; private oil merchants distribute edible oil for the state. All 337 permanent oil merchants in Tianjin distribute edible oil for the state. At the same time, in order to strengthen the management of the oil and fat market and do a good job in the supply of edible oil, Beijing Oil and Fat Company has established business departments in Xuanwu, Dongsi, and Xisi districts, and established nine supply stations in other districts. Tianjin Oil and Fat Company has established five edible oil supply stores in the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth districts and Tanggu, directly supplying edible oil to state-owned retail companies, cooperatives, and private oil merchants and peddlers. Beijing has also established a industrial oil business department in Qianmen district, specializing in the supply of oil products for industrial production; the municipal oil and fat company uses the method of fixed-point supply and organizing edible oil vendors to deliver oil to the catering industry, so that distributors maintain a certain turnover.

    食油计划供应实施后
    北京、天津的食油供应得到保证
    食油实行计划供应后，北京、天津两市人民的食油供应得到了保证。解放以来，随着人民购买力的不断提高，食用油品的消费量也逐年增加。一九五三年北京市国营商业、合作社、私营商业全年食油销售量比一九五○年增加百分之一百二十二点零二；天津市一九五三年的食油销售量则比一九五○年增加百分之七十八点九一。这说明食油消费量的增长速度是很快的。加上当时不法私营油商的囤积、拒售、抬价、掺假、倒运外流等投机活动，使食油市场一度发生混乱，很多市民买不到油。今年三月实行食油计划供应后，国家掌握了油脂市场，打击了私商的投机活动，保证了食油的正常供应。北京市五十六户私营油厂和油坊，大部分给国家加工；私营油商则为国家经销食油。天津市三百三十七户专营食油的座商，全部为国家经销食油。同时，为加强油脂市场的管理，做好食油供应，北京市油脂公司在宣武、东四、西四三个区设立了营业部，在其他各区成立了九个供应站。天津市油脂公司在四、五、六、八区和塘沽设立了五个食油供应店，直接为国营零售公司、合作社和私营油商、油贩等零售点供应食油。北京市还在前门区设立了工业用油营业部，专门供应工业生产用的油品；市油脂公司用定点供应和组织食油摊贩给饮食业送油的办法，使经销商保持一定的营业额。
