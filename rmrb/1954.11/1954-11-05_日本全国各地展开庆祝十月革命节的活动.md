Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: To express the friendly feelings of the Japanese people toward the Soviet Union, people from all walks of life and organizations in Japan have launched activities across the country to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, and have designated the period from October 21st to November 30th as "Japan-Soviet Friendship Month."

This year's celebration activities in Japan started two or three weeks earlier than last year. The Soviet film evening hosted by the Tokyo Federation of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association began on October 16th. At the first film evening, Japanese House of Representatives member Akira Kazami delivered a speech, saying that the Soviet Union and China have announced to the world their readiness to resume diplomatic relations with Japan. The resumption of diplomatic relations has become a practical issue, and it is the duty of the Japanese nation to contribute to peace in Asia.

The scale of this year's celebration activities is also very large. In Hokkaido, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions, more than half of the prefectures had launched activities by October 18th. Large gatherings of more than 10,000 people will be held in Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya, and other places.

The conferences held during "Japan-Soviet Friendship Month" include the "Peace and Independence Conference," the "Conference to Promote the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China, and Japan and the Soviet Union," and conferences to promote East-West trade. Concerts or evenings of Soviet music and Soviet folk dances will also be held.
