    A Day at the Cotton Purchasing Station
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Song Jie
    November 12th was a clear day. At the break of dawn, the cotton purchasing station of the Yinjiagang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanghe County, Shandong Province, began to bustle with activity. Cotton farmers arrived from all directions with horse-drawn carts, handcarts, and shoulder poles. Before long, the spacious courtyard of the purchasing station was filled with two long rows of large cotton bales. Members of the Zhengjia Village and Zhujia Village agricultural production cooperatives in Wangji Township unloaded the cotton from their carts and hurried back to fetch a second load. Today marked the sixth time that these two agricultural production cooperatives had sold new cotton to the state. This time, they sold a total of 14,400 jin. The cotton they sold was not only plentiful but also clean.
    At noon, the sellers of cotton appeared even more crowded. I followed the grader and inspected more than thirty cotton bales, all of which were marked with the price for the highest grade. The grader, Wang Xiuli, told the reporter about the improvement in cotton quality this year compared to last year: Last year, the medium-grade cotton purchased by the purchasing station in September yielded only 36 jin of lint per 100 jin of seed cotton; by November, most of the cotton purchased was red cotton, yielding only 31 jin of lint per 100 jin of seed cotton. However, this year, they had not received any red cotton so far, and the lint yield per 100 jin of seed cotton had consistently remained around 36 jin, with the highest reaching 37.5 jin. He said, "Such a gratifying phenomenon is the first time I have seen it in my eight years of working as a cotton grader."
    After selling large quantities of cotton, the cotton farmers all went to the department store of the supply and marketing cooperative to select various production and living materials needed for this winter and next spring. The Chen Juqi mutual aid team from Shengjia Village, in preparation for transforming into an agricultural production cooperative this winter, purchased a double-wheeled double-shared plow and a ten-inch walking plow. Many farmers who sold cotton carried thermos bottles, flashlights, and woolen clothing; biscuits, lotus root flour, and apples, which the supply and marketing cooperative rarely sold in the past, also became bestsellers.
    On this day, the branch office of the Yinjiagang Credit Cooperative, located at the cotton purchasing station, was particularly busy, with many farmers coming to deposit their money and repay their loans immediately after selling cotton. In just two hours of staying here, I saw more than forty cotton farmers coming to deposit money. The Zhengjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative deposited all of the remaining 26.13 million yuan, after repaying loans and purchasing some farm tools, into the credit cooperative.
    At six o'clock in the evening, kerosene lamps were lit in the office of the cotton purchasing station. The purchasing staff were settling the accounts for the day. The daily report in the station manager's office recorded that this station, together with its five cotton purchasing teams, had purchased a total of 100,271.4 jin of seed cotton. Station manager Li Fang'an told the reporter, "Although the season for new cotton entering the market was more than ten days later than last year, the amount of cotton purchased up to today has reached more than 3,257,000 jin, an increase of 661,400 jin compared to the same period last year."

### 棉花收购站的一日

    棉花收购站的一日
    新华社记者　宋杰
    十一月十二日是一个天气晴朗的日子。天刚刚亮，山东省商河县殷家巷供销合作社棉花收购站就开始活跃起来。棉农们赶着马车、推着小车、挑着担子从四面八方拥来。不大一会，收购站宽敞的院子里，就摆满了长长的两列大棉花包。王集乡郑家村和朱家村的两个农业生产合作社的社员们，卸下车上的棉花，就又赶忙回去拉第二趟。今天，这两个农业生产合作社都是第六次向国家出售新棉。这一次他们共出售一万四千四百斤。他们出售的棉花不仅数量多，而且又干净。
    中午，卖棉花的人们显得更加拥挤。我随着分级员参观了三十多个棉花包，上面都是写着上等价格。分级员王秀礼向记者介绍了今年棉花质量比去年提高的情况：去年九月份收购站收购的中喷棉花，每百斤籽棉仅能加工出三十六斤皮棉；到十一月份收购的棉花多半都是红花，每百斤籽棉只能出三十一斤皮棉。可是今年直到现在还没有收到过红棉花，每百斤籽棉出皮棉始终在三十六斤上下，最高的出到三十七斤半。他说：“像这样喜人的现象，在我做棉花分级工作的八年来，还是头一次看到。”
    棉农们出售大量的棉花后，都到供销合作社的百货门市部选购今冬明春需用的各种生产和生活资料。绳家村陈聚奇互助组为了今冬转成农业生产合作社，购买了一部双轮双铧犁和一部十吋步犁。许多出售棉花的农民，手里都提着暖水瓶、手电筒和绒衣等；供销合作社过去很少经营的饼干、藕粉和苹果也成了畅销货。
    这一天，殷家巷信用合作社在购棉站设立的门市部显得特别忙碌，很多农民卖完棉花随手就来储蓄和缴还贷款。我仅仅在这里停留了两小时，就看到四十多个棉农前来储蓄。郑家村农业生产合作社出售棉花的金额除缴还贷款和购买一部分农具外，所余二千六百一十三万元全部存到信用合作社。
    晚上六点钟，棉花收购站的办公室里燃起了煤油灯。收购人员正在结算这一天的账目。站长室今天的日报表上记载着：这个站连同所属的五个购棉小组共收购籽棉十万零二千七百一十四斤。李方安站长告诉记者说：“今年新棉上市的季节虽然比去年推迟十多天，但到今天收购的棉花数量已达到三百二十五万七千多斤，比去年同期增加了六十六万一千四百斤。”
