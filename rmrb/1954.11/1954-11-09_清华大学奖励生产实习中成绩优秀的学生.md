Tsinghua University rewarded fifty-seven students who achieved excellent results in their production internships and commended two internship team leaders for their outstanding work.

This summer, more than 2,000 students from Tsinghua University participated in production internships. During the two-month internship, they generally observed discipline and completed their internship tasks. The students who received awards this time demonstrated good performance in completing production tasks, individual assignments, providing rationalization proposals, and improving internship methods. Ni Guangrong, a student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, improved a milling machine fixture for a factory in his individual assignment, reviving a milling machine that had been out of service for a long time. Ma Xueni and Cai Xiusheng, students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, made rationalization proposals to the construction site where they were working, greatly improving the efficiency of the stone crusher. Tian Zhenhai, a student from the Department of Civil Engineering, was rated as an "Excellent Worker" during his internship. The two internship team leaders who were commended were Feng Cheng from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Liu Naiquan from the Department of Electrical Engineering. Feng Cheng's internship team, from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, fourth grade, interned at the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory in Yuci City, Shanxi Province. They not only completed the learning tasks stipulated in the internship syllabus, but also designed twenty-nine sets of fixtures, forty sets of tools and accessories, and nine kinds of technological regulations for the factory. Liu Naiquan's internship team, from the Department of Electrical Engineering, fourth grade, encountered many difficulties during their internship at the Fuxin Power Plant, but they united as one, relied on the workers, and comprehensively completed the internship tasks. All twenty-four students in the team passed the grade technical examination with knowledge equivalent to that of a deputy shift leader, with an average score of 4.3. (Xinhua News Agency)

    清华大学奖励生产实习中成绩优秀的学生
    清华大学奖励五十七名在生产实习中成绩优秀的学生并表扬了两个工作优秀的实习队长。
    今年暑期清华大学参加生产实习的学生有两千多名，在二个多月的实习中，一般都遵守纪律，完成了实习任务。这次受奖的学生在完成生产任务、个人作业、提供合理化建议和改进实习方法等方面都有良好的成绩。机械制造系学生倪光荣在个人作业中替某工厂改进了一个铣床的夹具，使这台停用多时的铣床复活了。水利系学生马学尼、蔡秀升向所在的工地提出合理化建议，使碎石机效率提高很多。土木工程系学生田振海在实习时被评为“优良工作者”。受表扬的两名实习队队长是机械制造系的冯城和电机系的刘乃泉。机械制造系四年级冯城实习小队，在山西省榆次市经纬纺织机械厂实习，不仅完成了实习大纲中所规定的学习任务，并替工厂设计了二十九套夹具、四十套刀具和附件，九种工艺规程。电机系四年级刘乃泉实习小队，在阜新发电厂实习中，遇到很多困难，但他们团结一致，依靠工人，全面地完成了实习任务。全队二十四个学生经过相当副值班长知识水平的工级技术考试，平均成绩达四点三分。  （新华社）
