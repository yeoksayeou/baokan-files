Employees of the Fushun Second Construction Site, under the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, have recently created a new method of formwork support—using angle iron to form a framework. When used in reinforced concrete frame structures, this significantly accelerates construction speed. This new method of formwork support was successfully created through close collaboration between technician Huang Weiguo and engineer Deng Renfeng, with guidance from Soviet experts. They first trialed the angle iron framework on a three-story reinforced concrete frame structure project, completing the engineering task in just sixty hours, compared to the sixteen days it previously took. Subsequently, the Fourth Engineering Company used the angle iron framework on the top five floors of an eight-story building, forty-two meters high, at a construction site in Jilin, completing the pouring of the entire structure of the top five floors of the building in just twenty-four days. These two tests have proven that the new formwork method speeds up construction by 50% to 100% compared to the old method; with skilled labor, work efficiency can be further improved.

The use of angle iron support has the following advantages: First, because angle iron is rigid, it can be connected to the height of several floors at once; by widening the formwork support for the load-bearing beams and using angle iron as diagonal bracing, planks can be laid for pedestrian and operational access, serving as scaffolding. This eliminates the need to erect scaffolding separately. Second, in general, when building multi-story buildings using wooden formwork, the three processes of tying rebar, supporting formwork, and pouring concrete cannot be carried out simultaneously on different floors, nor can these three processes be implemented as an assembly line operation across several floors. With the application of angle iron framework, workers can operate simultaneously on several floors, implementing a three-dimensional parallel assembly line operation, which can greatly shorten the construction period. Third, fifty-centimeter-high standardized templates can be used on the angle iron framework, installed simultaneously with the pouring of concrete, which facilitates layered pouring and tamping, making it less prone to honeycombing, pitted surfaces, and other defects. Fourth, the angle iron framework is also equipped with railings, which can ensure the safety of high-altitude operations.

Editor's Note: Currently, some of our factory construction projects are using factory construction methods (i.e., implementing the prefabrication and installation of structural components), which is faster and more economical than pouring concrete on-site. Therefore, it does not require angle iron frameworks. However, for multi-story reinforced concrete structure projects, we do not yet have sufficient conditions to implement prefabrication and installation methods, so the use of angle iron framework is most appropriate. In addition, the use of angle iron framework requires a large initial investment in steel, and the amount of steel currently produced in our country is not yet abundant, so this method can only be promoted in key projects.

    有色金属工业管理局抚顺第二工地职工
    创造角铁模架大大加快施工速度
    重工业部有色金属工业管理局第四工程公司抚顺第二工地，最近创造出一套新的支模办法——用角铁组成模架，用在钢筋混凝土框架结构工程上，大大加快了施工速度。这种新的支模办法是由技术员黄维国和工程师邓仁风同工人密切合作，并在苏联专家指导下创造成功的。他们首先在一座三层钢筋混凝土框架结构工程上试用角铁模架，只用六十小时就完成了过去需要十六天才能完成的工程任务。接着，第四工程公司又在吉林某工地四十二公尺高的八层楼房的上五层使用了角铁模架，只用了二十四天的时间就将上五层大楼的全部结构浇灌完了。这两次试验证明，采用新支模法比旧法加快施工速度百分之五十至百分之一百；如果工作熟练，工作效率还可以提高。
    使用角铁支模有以下几点好处：一、因为角铁的刚性强，一次可以接上好几层楼的高度；把承托横梁的模架放宽一些，再用角铁作斜撑，铺上木板，就可以行人和操作，当脚手架用。这样就不用再竖立脚手架了。二、一般地建筑数层高的大楼，用木板支模，扎钢筋、支模板、浇灌混凝土三道工序不能在楼上楼下同时进行，也不能把这三道工序在几层楼上下实行流水作业；应用角铁模架，工人可以在几层楼上同时操作，实行立体平行流水作业，这就能大大地缩短工期。三、在角铁模架上可以使用五十公分高的定型模板，在浇灌混凝土的同时进行安装，便于进行分层浇灌和捣固，因而不容易产生蜂窝、麻面等毛病。四、在角铁框架的横梁上还设有栏杆，能保证高空作业的安全。
    编者按：在目前，我国已有一部分厂房工程采用工厂化施工（即实行结构构件的预制安装法），这种办法比在现场浇灌混凝土又快、又省，因此它就不需要角铁模架了。但在多层钢筋混凝土结构工程上，我们还没有充足的条件实行预制安装法，所以它使用角铁模架最适宜。此外，使用角铁模架需要一次投入大批钢材，而我国目前生产的钢材还不很多，所以只能在重点工程上推广此法。
