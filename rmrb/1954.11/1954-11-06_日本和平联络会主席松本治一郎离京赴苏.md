    Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Matsumoto Jiichiro, advisor to the Japanese Socialist Party (Left-wing) and chairman of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, who was invited to visit our country, left Beijing for the Soviet Union by plane on the morning of the 5th.
    The following is Matsumoto Jiichiro's farewell address:
    Dear Chinese friends,
    I am leaving your country tomorrow. Before leaving, I would like to say a few words to express my gratitude.
    This time, I was invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to visit your country. Although I was late and could not attend the glorious National Day celebrations, during the past month or so, I visited Beijing, Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun and Tianjin with the kind hospitality of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and I saw in detail the actual situation of the socialist construction of the new China. During this period, I had the opportunity to have heart-to-heart talks with Premier Zhou Enlai and people from all walks of life who love peace, which is very grateful to me who has the lifelong wish to realize world peace. In particular, I would like to express my respect for Premier Zhou's sincerity in the issue of adjusting relations with Japan.
    Thanks to the great success of the Geneva Conference, Indochina has achieved a ceasefire, and the five principles of peaceful coexistence have been reached between China, India, and Myanmar, proving that all countries in the world, regardless of their ideology and political form, can coexist peacefully. The Japanese people, who were once used as experimental products of American atomic bombs, finally understood the true meaning of the American atomic and hydrogen bomb experiments after the Bikini Island hydrogen bomb experiment. Therefore, their anxiety and anger towards atomic and hydrogen bombs reached their peak. In the signature campaign to ban the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs as weapons of war and to demand that atomic and hydrogen bombs be placed under correct international supervision, the number of signatures has now reached more than 20 million. This is a good example of proving that only by recognizing the truth can righteous resistance be generated.
    At a time when the masses in Japan are enthusiastically calling for peace, the visit to Japan by Ms. Li Dequan and her delegation, which many peace-loving Japanese people have been looking forward to, has been realized; at the same time, the most effective and timely joint declaration between China and the Soviet Union for restoring normal relations between our country and your country and the Soviet Union has been issued; on the other hand, the delegation of members of the National Assembly who recently returned from China is also unanimously calling for the realization of world peace and the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and expressed their efforts to realize it.
    Based on these facts, I believe that in the near future, Japan will be able to restore normal diplomatic relations with countries that truly love peace.
    Tomorrow, I will go to Europe via the Soviet Union to attend the World Peace Council meeting. Before I leave, I would like to state here that I support the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration and vow to make further efforts for the true liberation of Asia and the world peace that follows. I once again express my gratitude to the Chinese friends and comrades, and wish the new China unlimited development and everyone good health.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live world peace!
    Matsumoto Jiichiro, November 4, 1954

### 日本和平联络会主席松本治一郎离京赴苏

    日本和平联络会主席松本治一郎离京赴苏
    【新华社五日讯】应邀来我国访问的日本社会党（左派）顾问、日本和平联络会主席松本治一郎，在五日晨乘飞机离开北京赴苏联。
    下面是松本治一郎的告别词亲爱的中国朋友们：
    明天就要离开贵国了，在临别之前，我简单地说几句话，以表示感谢。
    这次，我应中国人民外交学会的邀请来贵国访问，虽然因为迟到而未能参加光荣的国庆典礼，但是在这一个多月的时间内，在中国人民外交学会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的盛情招待下，我参观了北京、沈阳、鞍山、抚顺和天津等地，详尽地看到了新中国的社会主义建设的实际情况。其间，我能有机会和周恩来总理以及各界爱好和平的人士促膝而谈，对于以实现世界和平为平生愿望的我来说，是非常令我感激的。特别是对于周总理在同日本调整邦交的问题上所表示的诚意，表示敬意。
    由于日内瓦会议的伟大的成功，印度支那获得停战，在中国、印度、缅甸之间达成了五项和平原则的协议，证明了世界各国不论其思想和政治形态如何，是能够和平共处的。过去被当做美国原子弹实验品的日本人，经过了比基尼岛氢弹实验，终于明白了美国实验原子弹和氢弹的真意何在，于是，他们对原子弹和氢弹所表示的不安和愤怒达到了极点。在禁止利用原子弹和氢弹作为战争武器、要求把原子弹和氢弹置于正确的国际监督之下的签名运动中，签名人数现在已达二千万人以上。这是证明只有认清真理才能产生正义的抵抗的很好的例子。
    在日本国内群众热烈要求和平的呼声这样高昂的时候，曾为许多爱好和平的日本人民所翘首盼望的李德全女士一行的访问日本已经实现；同时，对于我国同贵国和苏联恢复正常的邦交关系最有效最合时宜的中苏联合宣言已经发表；另一方面，最近回国的国会议员访华代表团一行也在异口同声地高呼要实现世界和平和恢复日中邦交，并表示为其实现而努力。
    从这些事实看来，我相信在最近的将来，日本一定能和真正爱好和平的国家恢复正常的邦交。
    明天，我将经过苏联前往欧洲出席世界和平理事会会议，在我临行之前，我谨在此表明：我拥护中苏联合宣言，并誓为亚洲的真正解放及其随之而来的世界和平而作进一步的努力。我再一次向中国的诸位朋友和同志表示谢意，并祝新中国无限发展和诸位身体健康。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    松本治一郎  一九五四年十一月四日
