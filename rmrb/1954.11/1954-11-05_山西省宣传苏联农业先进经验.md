Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th. Shanxi Province is currently promoting the achievements and experiences of Soviet agricultural production among cadres and the masses of farmers. Fan Luduan, Deputy Director of the Agriculture Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, who visited the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow, has already given a report to more than 7,000 cadres directly under the province. Eight hundred and twenty-five cadres and model workers in the province have visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing, and they are also introducing the rich content of this exhibition to farmers throughout the province. The visitors' understanding of the advanced Soviet agricultural experience has been applied to the practical work of improving agricultural production. The Agriculture Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government is referring to the advanced Soviet agricultural experience to study how to overcome the shortcomings in past work and to formulate the 1955 agricultural production plan. When the members of the Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County heard Wu Chun'an, winner of the Patriotic Bumper Harvest Golden Star Medal, talk about the tall cotton plants he saw at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing, which could produce 2,000 jin of cotton per mu, they all felt that their current highest record of producing more than 1,000 jin of cotton per mu was far behind the Soviet Union, and that they should learn from the Soviet Union in the future.

Some farmers in Shanxi Province have already deeply realized the superiority of the advanced Soviet agricultural experience from their own experiences. The propaganda and introduction of advanced farmers and rural cadres who had visited the Soviet Union in the past had helped farmers to effectively apply the advanced Soviet agricultural experience and improve their production. The Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, where Li Shunda is located, followed the example of the collective farms in the Siberian mountainous areas of the Soviet Union and made a fifteen-year construction plan. This year, the whole cooperative began to carry out water and soil conservation work to transform the mountainous area, planting more than 70,000 trees and repairing 70 mu of river滩 land. Zhang Ren, the director of the Shanxi Provincial State-owned Jinyuan Mechanical Farm, learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet state-owned farms, developed diversified economy and improved business management. After overcoming the past losses, he began to turn over profits to the state.

    山西省宣传苏联农业先进经验
    【新华社太原四日电】山西省目前正在干部和农民群众中宣传苏联农业生产的成就和经验。曾经去莫斯科参观过苏联农业展览会的山西省人民政府农业厅副厅长范履端，已经向省直属机关的七千多名干部作了报告。全省有八百二十五名干部和劳动模范曾经在北京参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，他们也正在分别向全省农民介绍这个展览会的丰富内容。参观者对于苏联先进农业经验的体会，已经运用到改进农业生产的实际工作中。山西省人民政府农业厅正参照苏联农业先进经验，研究克服过去工作中的缺点，来编制一九五五年农业生产计划。翼城县西梁村农业生产合作社社员们，听到爱国丰产金星奖章获得者吴春安谈到他在北京的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上看到的高大的棉株，每亩能产二千斤棉花时，都觉得他们现在每亩棉田产一千多斤棉花的最高纪录，和苏联还相差很远，今后要好好地向苏联学习。
    山西省有些地区农民已经从亲身的经历中深深体会到苏联农业先进经验的优越性。过去曾经访问过苏联的先进农民和农村干部的宣传和介绍，曾经帮助农民们有成效地运用了苏联农业先进经验，而使自己的生产得到提高。李顺达所在的平顺县西沟乡农林畜牧生产合作社，依照苏联西伯利亚山区集体农庄的榜样，作出十五年建设规划。今年全社开始进行改造山区面貌的水土保持工作，植树七万多株，并修好了七十亩河滩地。山西省国营晋源机械农场场长张仁学习苏联国营农场先进经验，发展多种经济和改善经营管理后，克服了过去赔钱的现象，开始向国家上缴利润。
