    Saluting the Heroic Nation and the Heroic People
    Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    In September 1949—on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China—I had the honor to visit the heroic People's Republic of Albania as a representative of the victorious Chinese people, Chinese youth, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I only stayed in this admirable country for ten days, but the profound internationalist friendship of the Albanian people left me with unforgettable memories. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of the Albanian people, we express our heartfelt congratulations on the glorious achievements made by the People's Republic of Albania in socialist construction over the past ten years! We extend our sincere and lofty respect to the heroic Albanian people and the People's Army, who stand tall in Southeast Europe and defend world peace!
    Albania is a heroic nation. Due to its strategic location and natural resources, it has historically been coveted by foreign invaders. Currently, it is still surrounded and threatened by capitalist countries. However, the Albanian people have never yielded to any aggressor, ruler, threat, suppression, or massacre. The entire history of Albania is an epic of the people's struggle against domestic and foreign enslavers. As early as the fourth century, the Albanian people resisted the rule of the Roman Empire. In the fifteenth century, Turkish troops invaded Albania, and the Albanian people, under the leadership of the national hero Skanderbeg, bravely fought against the Ottoman marauders for twenty-five years and achieved final victory. During World War II, due to the frantic aggression of Fascist Italy and Germany, the Albanian people suffered unprecedented disasters, and the people's resistance struggle became even stronger. Especially after the founding of the Albanian Communist Party (now the Labor Party) in 1941, the strength of the people's struggle grew rapidly under the strong leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha. In 1943, the Albanian People's Liberation Army was formally formed, and it launched a fierce and tenacious battle to strike the Fascists, successfully smashing the occupying forces' "sweeps," containing 250,000 occupying troops, including four German divisions, on its own soil, and inflicting losses of more than 53,000 on the occupying forces. In 1944, the Soviet army inflicted a devastating blow on the Hitler bandit army, liberating Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Under this favorable condition, the Albanian people and the People's Liberation Army completely liberated their own territory on November 29, 1944, and established a people's government. On January 11, 1946, the People's Republic of Albania was formally established. The Albanian people have since won a historic and great victory. Albania is not only a heroic nation in history, but also stands at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace today. After the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania, the imperialists and their lackeys were extremely unwilling. They extremely hated the victory of the Albanian people and regarded the People's Republic of Albania as a "thorn in their side." On the one hand, they openly organized aggressive military alliances aimed at armed attacks on Albania, constantly provoking incidents on the Albanian border with armed forces, and on the other hand, they intensified various espionage activities in every possible way, plotting to subvert the Albanian people's government. The heroic People's Republic of Albania, as a member of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union, vigilantly shattered all the enemy's sinister plots, stood like a granite rock on the Adriatic coast, and made its greatest contribution to the socialist construction of the motherland and to the cause of world peace. Although Albania is thousands of miles away from China, it is a close brother to the Chinese people, sharing weal and woe. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are honored and proud to have such a heroic brotherly country!
    The Albanian people are a heroic people. In the short span of ten years, the Albanian people, with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the support of the people's democratic countries, have carried out selfless labor under the leadership of their beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha. On the ruins of war, they are gradually building an extremely backward semi-feudal agricultural country into an emerging socialist industrialized nation. The Chinese people know that in terms of industry, before liberation, Albania only had some small-scale factories and mines belonging to capitalists. After the two-year plan for developing the national economy from 1949 to 1950, and the five-year plan that began in 1951, Albania has now established new industries belonging to the whole people with modern technical equipment. Not only have huge textile, sugar, timber, cement, cotton ginning, rice milling, tobacco, and glass factories been established, but also new-type oil refineries and coal mining industries have been established. Albania's first hydroelectric power station—the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station—has long been completed, and the huge hydroelectric power station named after Comrade Hoxha will be completed in 1955. In the past, transportation relied almost entirely on livestock, but now four railways and many highways have been built, and trains and automobiles have made Albania's transportation industry developed. At the end of 1954, the total industrial output will increase to 11.4 times the pre-war level of 1938. In terms of agriculture, due to the implementation of land reform, farmers have been allocated more than 172,000 hectares of land, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Before the war, the cultivated area was only 3,000 square kilometers, accounting for about one-tenth of the total area of the country. In 1954, the sown area was 69.7 percent larger than before the war. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the state has established state farms and tractor stations, and agricultural production cooperatives have been organized one after another. Tractors and other agricultural machines have appeared for the first time in the ancient Albanian fields. The socialist proportion in agriculture is rapidly increasing. The government has also taken measures such as agricultural loans and water conservancy projects to help farmers, thus making agricultural production more than 30 percent higher than before the war. With the development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the Albanian working people has also been improved. In 1954, residents received 68 percent more sugar than in 1950, 37.8 percent more meat and fish, 101.1 percent more cotton fabrics, 73 percent more wool fabrics, and 137.3 percent more leather shoes. In terms of education and culture, before liberation, more than 80 percent of the residents in the country were illiterate. Now, a cultural revolution has been carried out. In 1953, universal education was implemented nationwide, and a seven-year compulsory education system is being gradually implemented. In 1938, there were only 643 primary schools, 11 seven-year schools, and secondary schools in the country. In the 1954-1955 academic year, the number of primary schools has increased to 2,140, and the number of seven-year schools and secondary schools has increased to 343. Six universities have been opened. In addition, the first Academy of Sciences in Albanian history, the Agricultural Research Institute, and the Hydrometeorological Institute have been established. Cultural palaces, libraries, and reading rooms have been widely established, and theaters and cinemas have been built in the capital and major cities. In 1953, the number of hospitals was more than six times that of 1938. The state has allocated millions of lek (Albanian currency) for the social insurance and maternal and child health care of employees. The population increase rate rises every year, and the mortality rate decreases every year. In the past five years, Albania has also implemented three price reductions, and the material and cultural life of the people has been greatly improved compared with before the war. With the development and achievements of socialist economic construction, the material and cultural needs of the Albanian people will be satisfied to the greatest extent. The road traveled by heroic Albania in the past ten years is precisely the road of peaceful economic development taken by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The results of the creative labor of the heroic Albanian people once again provide a vivid example for all peace-loving countries and people, and are also a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are building socialism. The Chinese people are deeply moved by the great achievements of the industrious Albanian people in the socialist construction cause over the past ten years, and regard it as their own victory, expressing warm congratulations.
    The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army highly admire the Albanian People's Army. The heroic Albanian People's Army was tempered, grew, and strengthened in the extremely arduous struggle against the German and Italian Fascist bandits, and it was also built up in an environment of vigilantly shattering the provocations and sabotage of imperialists and their lackeys. We deeply know that this heroic army, like the Soviet army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is an army of workers and peasants led by the Communist Party, an army of patriotism and internationalism armed with Marxism-Leninism, and therefore it is a powerful and invincible army. This heroic army is not only the founder of the motherland, the defender and participant of the motherland's peaceful construction, but also the defender of world peace. Due to the complete consistency of this heroic army with the Chinese People's Liberation Army in many places, and because they both stand on the front line of the struggle to defend peace, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are very concerned about the continuous consolidation and improvement of the combat effectiveness of this heroic army, which is of course understandable for the brotherly Albanian people and the People's Army.
    The Albanian people are a peace-loving people. For the past ten years, the People's Republic of Albania has pursued a peaceful foreign policy, actively carried out friendly cooperation with the people of all countries, and has made significant achievements in its efforts to improve relations with its neighbors in Southeast Europe. In particular, the unbreakable friendship and cooperation formed with the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have made heroic Albania a strong fortress of peace in Southeast Europe. Like the Chinese people, the Albanian people have always had a deep friendship with the Soviet people. We have not only shattered the shackles of Fascism and gained liberation with the help of Soviet friendship, but also received generous and selfless assistance from the powerful Soviet Union in our construction cause after liberation. The armies of our two countries are also striving to learn from the example of the Soviet army, and constantly strengthening the construction of modernization and regularization. Our two peoples cherish the brotherly friendship between our common friend—the great Soviet people—as much as we cherish our own eyes.
    The Chinese and Albanian people have always had a deep and sincere friendship. As early as in the difficult revolutionary struggle against Fascism, the fighting Chinese people could not only deeply appreciate the suffering of the Albanian people and infinitely sympathize with the Albanian people's liberation struggle, but also were inspired by the heroic spirit of the Albanian people in resisting aggression. Due to the existence of the Soviet Union and the world-historic victory of the Soviet army over German and Japanese Fascism, and due to the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China, it is even more possible for the Chinese and Albanian people, who are so far away geographically, to feel so close to each other, and our friendship is so deep. This year, our two countries have exchanged ambassadors again, and the friendship between our two countries has become more consolidated and developed. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Albanian people have common ideals, have common great and generous friends, and we are both on the front line of the struggle to defend world peace, advancing towards socialism. Our friendship will be further consolidated and developed, and our just cause will surely triumph.
    We wish the heroic Albanian people new victories in the cause of building socialism and in the cause of striving for peace and international security!

    向英雄的国家和英雄的人民致意
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任  萧华
    一九四九年九月——中华人民共和国成立的前夕，我有机会荣幸地作为胜利了的中国人民、中国青年和中国人民解放军的代表，访问了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。在这个可敬爱的国家里，我仅仅逗留了十天，但阿尔巴尼亚人民深厚的国际主义友情，却使我永怀难忘。际此阿尔巴尼亚人民解放十周年纪念日，我们谨以无比欢欣的心情，对于阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国十年来在社会主义建设中所获得的辉煌成就，表示衷心的祝贺！向雄伟地屹立在东南欧、捍卫着世界和平的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军，遥致亲切而崇高的敬意！
    阿尔巴尼亚是英雄的国家。由于它的战略地位和自然富源，历史上一直为异族侵略者所垂涎。目前，还受到资本主义国家的包围和威胁。但阿尔巴尼亚人民在一切侵略者、统治者威胁、镇压、屠杀的面前，从来没有屈服过。阿尔巴尼亚的全部历史，就是一部人民反抗本国及外国奴役者斗争的可歌可泣的历史。早在第四世纪，阿尔巴尼亚人民曾经反抗过罗马帝国的统治，十五世纪时土耳其的军队侵入阿尔巴尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚人民在民族英雄斯坎德培格领导之下，为了反对奥托曼帝国的流寇，曾经英勇地斗争了二十五年，并获得了最后的胜利。在第二次世界大战期间，由于法西斯意大利和德国的疯狂侵略，阿尔巴尼亚人民曾遭受到空前的灾难，而人民的反抗斗争也就更加强大了。特别是一九四一年阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现称劳动党）成立以后，人民斗争的力量，在共产党和恩维尔·霍查同志坚强的领导之下，更加飞速地壮大和发展起来。一九四三年正式组成了阿尔巴尼亚人民解放军，猛烈地展开了打击法西斯的顽强战斗，胜利地击破了占领军的“扫荡”，在自己的国土上，牵制了二十五万占领军，其中包括四个德国师，并使占领军损失了五万三千多人。一九四四年苏联军队给予希特勒匪军以毁灭性的打击，解放了南斯拉夫和保加利亚。在这个有利条件下，阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民解放军于一九四四年十一月二十九日全部解放了自己的国土，建立了人民政权。一九四六年一月十一日，正式成立了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。阿尔巴尼亚的人民从此获得了历史性的伟大胜利。阿尔巴尼亚不仅在历史上是个英雄的民族，今天也站在保卫世界和平斗争的最前线。当阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国成立以后，帝国主义者及其走狗们是极不甘心的，它们极端仇视阿尔巴尼亚人民的胜利，把阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国视为“眼中之钉”。一面公开组织以武装进攻阿尔巴尼亚为目的的侵略性的军事联盟，不断地以武装力量在阿尔巴尼亚国境寻衅，一面千方百计地加紧进行各种间谍活动，阴谋颠覆阿尔巴尼亚人民政权。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国作为以伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主和社会主义大家庭的一员，警惕地粉碎了敌人的一切罪恶阴谋，像花岗岩石般地屹立在亚得里亚海海滨，为祖国的社会主义建设、为世界和平事业作了自己最大的贡献。阿尔巴尼亚离中国虽有万里之遥，但是和中国人民却是休戚相关、患难相知的亲兄弟，中国人民和中国人民解放军为自己有了这样一个英雄的兄弟之邦，而感到光荣和骄傲！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是英雄的人民。在短短的十年中，阿尔巴尼亚人民在伟大苏联的无私的帮助下，在各人民民主国家的支持下，在自己敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志领导之下，进行了忘我的劳动。在战争的废墟上，正在把一个极为落后的半封建的农业国，逐步建设成为一个新兴的社会主义工业化的国家。中国人民熟悉：在工业方面，解放前，阿尔巴尼亚只有一些规模不大的属于资本家的工厂和矿山。经过一九四九年—一九五○年发展国民经济的两年计划，一九五一年开始实行的五年计划，现在，阿尔巴尼亚已经建立了属于全民所有的具有现代化技术设备的新工业。不仅建立了巨大的纺织、制糖、木材、水泥、轧棉、碾米、烟草、玻璃等工厂，还建立了新型的石油精炼厂和采煤业。阿尔巴尼亚第一个水电站——列宁水电站早已完工，以霍查同志的名字命名的巨大的水力发电站将在一九五五年建成。过去，运输几乎全靠牲畜，现在已筑成四条铁路和许多公路，火车和汽车使阿尔巴尼亚的交通运输业发达起来。一九五四年年底，工业总产量将增为战前一九三八年水平的十一点四倍。在农业方面，由于实行了土地改革，农民分到了十七万二千多公顷的土地，生产积极性大为提高。战前耕地面积只有三千平方公里，约占全国总面积的十分之一。一九五四年播种面积比战前扩大百分之六十九点七。在苏联的援助下，国家建立了国营农场和拖拉机站，农业生产合作社已纷纷组织起来了。在古老的阿尔巴尼亚的田野上第一次出现了拖拉机和其他农业机器。农业中的社会主义比重迅速增加。政府还采取了农业贷款和兴修水利的办法帮助农民，因而使农业生产超过战前百分之三十以上。随着国民经济的发展，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民物质和文化生活也得到了改善。一九五四年居民得到的糖要比一九五○年多百分之六十八，肉类和鱼类多百分之三十七点八，棉织品多一百零一点一，毛织品多百分之七十三，皮鞋多百分之一百三十七点三。在教育和文化方面，解放前国内百分之八十以上的居民是文盲，现在进行了文化革命，一九五三年全国实行了普及教育制，并正在逐步实施七年义务教育制度。一九三八年国内只有六百四十三所小学，十一所七年制学校和中等学校，而在一九五四—一九五五学年，小学的数目已增加到二千一百四十所，七年制学校和中等学校已增加到三百四十三所。开办了六个高等学校。此外还建立了阿尔巴尼亚历史上第一个科学院，建立了农业研究所和水文气象所。文化宫、图书馆、阅览室已普遍建立起来，首都及各大城市还修建了剧院、电影院。一九五三年医院数目为一九三八年的六倍以上。国家拨了数以百万计的里克（阿币）用于职工的社会保险和妇婴保健事业。人口增加率每年上升，死亡率每年下降。最近五年阿尔巴尼亚还实行了三次减低物价，人民的物质文化生活较之战前大大提高了。随着社会主义经济建设的发展和成就，必将使阿尔巴尼亚人民物质和文化的需要得到最大限度的满足。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚十年来所走过的道路，正是苏联和各人民民主国家所走的和平经济发展的道路。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民创造性的劳动的成果，再一次给一切爱好和平的国家和人民提供了一个生动的榜样，对于正在建设社会主义的中国人民，也是一个巨大的鼓舞。中国人民为勤劳的阿尔巴尼亚人民十年来社会主义建设事业的巨大成就而深深地感动，并把它看成是自己的胜利一样，表示热烈地庆祝。
    中国人民和人民解放军十分崇敬阿尔巴尼亚人民军。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军是在抵抗德意法西斯强盗的极其艰苦的斗争中锻炼、成长壮大起来的，也是在警惕地粉碎帝国主义者及其走狗挑衅和破坏的环境中建设起来的。我们深知：这支英雄的军队和苏联军队及中国人民解放军一样，是共产党领导的工农劳动人民的军队，是马克思列宁主义武装起来的爱国主义和国际主义的军队，因而它是强大的不可战胜的军队。这支英雄的军队，不仅是祖国的创建者，是祖国和平建设的保卫者和参加者，而且是世界和平的保卫者。由于这支英雄的军队和中国人民解放军许多地方的完全一致，又都站在保卫和平斗争的前哨上，因而中国人民和中国人民解放军在万里之外十分关切这支英雄的军队战斗力的不断巩固与提高，这对于兄弟般的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军来说，当然是可以理解的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是热爱和平的人民。十年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国奉行着和平外交政策，积极开展同各国人民间的友好合作，并已在努力改善与东南欧各邻国的关系中取得了重大的成就，尤其是和苏联、中国及各人民民主国家间结成的牢不可破的友谊与合作，已使英雄的阿尔巴尼亚成为东南欧一个坚强的和平堡垒。阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民一样，一向同苏联人民有着深厚的友谊，我们不仅都在苏联友谊的帮助之下，粉碎了法西斯的枷锁，获得了解放，而且在解放后的建设事业中，同样都从强大的苏联得到慷慨无私的援助。我们两国的军队，也都正在努力学习着苏联军队的榜样，不断地加强着现代化正规化的建设。我们两国人民都像爱护自己眼珠一样，无限珍贵和我们共同的朋友——伟大苏联人民之间的兄弟般的友谊。
    中、阿两国人民一向就有着深厚的真挚的友谊。远在反抗法西斯的艰苦的革命斗争的年代里，战斗的中国人民不仅能深切地体会到阿尔巴尼亚人民的痛苦，无限地同情阿尔巴尼亚人民的解放斗争，而且受到了阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗侵略的英雄精神的鼓舞。由于苏联的存在和苏军对德日法西斯所取得的具有全世界历史意义的胜利，由于阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国的建立，更有可能使在地理上这样遥远的中、阿两国人民感到是如此的亲近，我们的友情是如此的深厚。今年我们两国又互派了大使，我们两国间的友谊是更加巩固和更加发展了。我们深信：中、阿两国人民有着共同的理想，有着共同的伟大而慷慨的朋友，我们又都是在保卫世界和平斗争的前哨上，向着社会主义前进。我们的友谊必将更进一步地巩固和发展，我们正义的事业是一定会胜利的。
    祝英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义事业中，在争取和平和国际安全的事业中获得新的胜利！
