	While the Greater Khingan Mountains in the north are already covered in white snow, winter on Hainan Island is still a scene of springtime. The island has neither snow nor frost, and is full of green hills and fields, like spring all year round. Workers in the island's sixty-plus coffee plantations are busy picking coffee; the endless coconut groves on the east coast are laden with coconuts. Although the seasons for harvesting pineapples, mangoes, lychees, and longans have passed, strings of bananas still hang from the trees. The Li and Miao people in the Wuzhi Mountains, who love hunting, have begun their activities of hunting deer for velvet antlers.

	Hainan Island is a tropical island in our country. It can be cultivated all year round. This year, the island has once again reaped a bumper harvest. Farmers are wielding their sickles for the autumn harvest. Although many areas of the island have suffered natural disasters, the island's main grain output has still increased by about 20% compared to last year; the yield of more than one million mu of miscellaneous grains has also increased compared to last year.

	Now, the island's winter production activities have begun again. This winter, the Lingao and Fushan state-owned mechanical farms plan to plant another 1,000-plus mu of industrial raw materials such as sisal hemp, citronella grass, and coffee. Since their establishment this spring, these two mechanical farms have planted more than 8,400 mu of crops such as sisal hemp, citronella grass, and coffee. The winter fishing season for coastal fisheries has also arrived. Hundreds of fishing boats in the harbor have set sail again. This is a month earlier than last year. Now, the famous Tokyo Bay, Yulin Bay, and Qizhouyang fishing grounds are bustling with fishing boats. Fishermen are engaged in labor competitions to complete this year's plan to increase fishery production by more than 100,000 dan. The seventeen fishery production cooperatives established this year are very active in the winter fishing season. The eight boats of the Duntougang Fishery Production Cooperative in Changgan County caught more than 30,000 jin of fish in the first eleven days of the winter fishing season, with each fishing boat earning more than 8 million yuan. Salt production on Hainan Island's coast also continues as usual in winter. More than 1,000 salt workers in the two major state-owned salt areas in the southern end of the island, Yulin (Sanya) and Changjiang (Ganen), are also working hard to complete the task of producing 180,000 dan of salt in the fourth quarter.

    海南岛的初冬
    新华社记者  冯子平
    现在北方的兴安岭已经是白雪皑皑了，但海南岛的冬天仍然是一片春色。岛上既不下雪，也不降霜，到处青山绿野，常年如春。岛上六十多个咖啡园的工人正忙着采摘咖啡；东海岸一望无边的椰子林，满结着累累的椰实。菠萝、芒果、荔枝、龙眼、槟榔等虽已过了收获期，但成串的香蕉仍挂满树上。五指山中爱好打猎的黎、苗族人民，开始了打鹿取茸的活动。
    海南岛是我国的一个热带岛屿。一年四季都可耕种。今年岛上又喜丰收。农民正在挥镰秋收。尽管岛上不少地区遭受自然灾害，但全岛主要粮食产量仍然比去年增产二成左右；一百多万亩杂粮也比去年增产。
    现在，岛上的冬季生产活动又开始了，临高、福山两个国营机械农场，今年冬季准备再栽种工业原料剑麻、香茅和咖啡等一千多亩。这两个机械农场今年春天成立以来，已栽种了剑麻、香茅、咖啡等作物八千四百多亩。沿海渔业的冬汛又到了。港内的千百只渔船又出海了。这比起去年来提早了一个月。现在，著名的东京湾、榆林海、七洲洋等渔场上，渔船往来如梭。渔民们正为完成今年增产十多万担的渔产计划而进行劳动竞赛。今年成立的十七个渔业生产合作社，在冬汛生产中显得非常活跃。昌感县墩头港渔业生产合作社八条船，在冬汛开始的十一天中就捕了三万多斤鱼，每条渔船收入八百多万元。海南岛沿海的盐业冬天也照常生产。岛南端的地方国营榆（林）（三）亚、昌（江）感（恩）两大盐区一千多盐工，也正为完成第四季度生产十八万担盐的任务而紧张劳动。
