    Since September 1, the Liaoning Provincial Company of the China Food Company has been purchasing autumn apples in apple-producing areas such as Gaiping and Fuxian counties. As of early November, the quantity purchased exceeded the 1954 annual purchase plan by 16.7 percent, equivalent to 3.3 times the quantity purchased during the same period last year. Liaoning Province has basically completed the 1954 annual apple export plan, with the export quantity approximately 2.7 times the export volume of last year. Among them, the export volume to the Soviet Union exceeded the plan by 3.7 percent, and the export volume to the Mongolian People's Republic exceeded the plan by 8.95 percent. This year, Liaoning Province also transported a large number of apples to various parts of the country. As of early November, more than 2,800 train carriages of apples had been transported by rail to major cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas across the country. (Zhang Wuyan)

    辽宁省苹果出口数量增加
    中国食品公司辽宁省公司从九月一日起在盖平、复县等苹果产区收购秋苹果，到十一月上旬收购的数量，超过一九五四年度收购计划百分之十六点七，等于去年同时期收购数量的三点三倍。辽宁省一九五四年度苹果出口计划已经基本完成，输出数量约等于去年输出量的二点七倍。其中对苏联输出数量超过计划百分之三点七，对蒙古人民共和国输出数量超过计划百分之八点九五。辽宁省今年运往国内各地的苹果也很多。到十一月上旬，经铁路运往全国各大城市、工矿区、林区的苹果，已经有二千八百多车厢。　　（张五彦）
