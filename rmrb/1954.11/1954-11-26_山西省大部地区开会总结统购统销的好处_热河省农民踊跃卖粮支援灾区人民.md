    Most counties in Shanxi Province have successively held expanded cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels to deploy the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and the unified sale of grain. The cadre meetings in each county summarized the benefits of unified purchase and supply. In the past year, the state has supplied the people of Shanxi Province with more than 1.6 billion jin of grain, of which nearly two-thirds was supplied to rural areas. Last April, after wheat in the cash crop areas of southern Shanxi was damaged by frost, grain merchants took the opportunity to speculate, causing the market price of grain to be 23 to 38 percent higher than the state price. Since the implementation of unified grain purchase and supply, grain prices have remained stable this year. Farmers in Quzhai Township, Luan County, used 20 million yuan from selling grain to purchase large quantities of soybean cake, fertilizer, pesticides, farm tools, etc., and invested them in production, resulting in a bumper harvest this year. Cadres in various places also connected the fact that in 1952, when wheat in southern Shanxi suffered from frost damage, the state transferred more than 300 million jin of grain to support the disaster area, and discussed the relationship between unified grain purchase and supporting disaster areas.
    After such discussions, the ideological awareness of the cadres has been greatly improved, and they have expressed their determination to resolutely complete or over fulfill the state's unified purchase tasks. Township cadres in Liangjiayuan Township, Fushan County, initially said that their township could only sell 10,000 jin of surplus grain, but after discussion, they stated that the entire township could sell 80,000 jin of surplus grain.

    When farmers in Rehe Province sold large amounts of surplus grain after this year's bumper harvest, they vividly remembered the state's support during past disasters. Farmers in Chengde, Pingquan, Longhua, Ningcheng, Luanping, Qinglong, Lingyuan, Chaoyang and other counties, at grain sales forums and mass meetings held in villages, recalled that from 1949 to 1951, when they suffered continuous and severe natural disasters, the state transferred large quantities of grain from other places to supply disaster victims, and distributed large amounts of relief grain, money, clothing, hats, shoes, socks, and lent grain and loans to help farmers produce and survive the famine. They all expressed their determination to sell more surplus grain to support the people in the disaster areas. Farmers in Ganggangyingzi Village, Ningcheng County, survived the famine in 1950 by relying on the grain supplied by the state. This year, the whole village had a bumper harvest, and when the farmers learned that some places had suffered disasters, they expressed deep concern. They said: "Things are feared to be reversed, and principles are feared to be overturned. In the past, people rescued us, and now we have a bumper harvest. Isn't it wrong to not sell surplus grain to support the disaster areas?" Now, the farmers in the whole village have recognized the sale of more than 510,000 jin of surplus grain, exceeding last year's grain sales figure by 31.7 percent. In Niangniangmiao Village, Chengde County, 90 percent of the farmers relied on relief grain and loans to survive in 1950. This year, they are very enthusiastic about selling surplus grain to support the disaster areas. Now, they have reported the sale of more than 150,000 jin of surplus grain, and the reported quantity is still increasing.　(Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省大部地区开会总结统购统销的好处
    热河省农民踊跃卖粮支援灾区人民
    山西省绝大部分县已先后开完县、区、乡三级扩大干部会议，布置了粮食、棉花、油料统购和粮食统销工作。各县的干部会议都总结了统购统销的好处。这一年来，国家供应山西省人民十六亿多斤粮食，其中有近三分之二供应农村。去年四月，晋南经济作物区小麦受冻后，粮食商人就乘机投机倒把，使粮食市价高出国家牌价百分之二十三到三十八。自实行粮食统购统销后，今年粮价一直稳定。潞安县璩寨乡农民用卖粮款二千万元，购买大量豆饼、肥料、药剂、农具等，投入生产，使今年的庄稼得到丰收。各地干部还联系一九五二年晋南地区小麦遭受冻灾，国家调粮三亿多斤来支援的事实，讨论了粮食统购和支援灾区的关系。
    经过这样讨论，干部们的思想觉悟大大提高，表示要坚决完成或超额完成国家统购任务。浮山县梁家垣乡的乡干部开始说他们乡只能出卖余粮一万斤，经过讨论，表示全乡可出卖余粮八万斤。

    热河省农民在今年丰收后大量出卖余粮的时候，对过去受灾时国家的支援，记忆犹新。承德、平泉、隆化、宁城、滦平、青龙、凌源、朝阳等县农民，在村中举行的售粮座谈会和群众大会上，回忆起一九四九年到一九五一年连续遭受严重的自然灾害时，国家由外地调来大批粮食供应灾民，并发放大批救济粮、款、衣、帽、鞋、袜和贷粮、贷款帮助农民生产渡荒，他们都表示要多卖余粮支援灾区人民。宁城县岗岗营子村的农民，在一九五零年闹灾荒时靠国家供应粮食才渡过了荒年。今年全村丰收，当农民知道有些地方遭灾时，都表示深切关怀。他们说：事怕颠倒理怕翻，从前人家救济了咱们，现在咱们丰收了，不卖余粮支援灾区，对吗？现在全村农民已认售余粮五十一万多斤，超过去年售粮数字百分之三十一点七。承德县娘娘庙村，一九五零年，有百分之九十的农户依靠救济粮和贷粮过活。今年，他们对出售余粮支援灾区都非常踊跃，现在已报卖余粮十五万多斤，报卖的数量还在继续增加。　（新华社）
