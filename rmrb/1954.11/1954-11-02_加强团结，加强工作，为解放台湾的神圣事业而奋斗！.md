    Strengthen Unity, Intensify Work, and Strive for the Sacred Cause of Liberating Taiwan!
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction
    On August 11, 1954, the Government of the People's Republic of China passed a resolution calling on the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to strengthen their work in all aspects and strive to liberate Taiwan and complete the sacred cause of liberating the Chinese people. On August 22, various democratic parties and people's organizations in China issued a joint declaration, announcing to the world that Taiwan is Chinese territory and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.
    Over the past two months, everyone has seen that the call to liberate Taiwan has received enthusiastic support from the people at home and has become a great material force. Workers and peasants have pledged to actively produce and support the liberation of Taiwan with practical strength. The People's Liberation Army has accepted the mission with unparalleled excitement, ensuring to enhance its combat strength. People from other walks of life have also expressed their willingness to support the liberation of Taiwan with concrete actions and strive for the complete victory of eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    The struggle to liberate Taiwan has also won the deep sympathy and broad support of peace-loving people abroad.
    Why can the struggle to liberate Taiwan receive such widespread support? This is because the struggle to liberate Taiwan is a just cause. A just cause will surely unite the people of the whole country and win the support of all international friends. A just cause, as Chairman Mao Zedong taught us, cannot be broken by any enemy.
    Our people all know and remember: In the hundred years since the Opium War, the Chinese nation has suffered numerous disasters. In foreign relations, our country had actually lost its status as an independent country, and the vast majority of the people lived a very painful life. I am seventy-seven years old this year. I have personally witnessed the corruption and incompetence of the Manchu Qing government and its betrayal of national sovereignty; I have personally witnessed the separatist warlord infighting of the Northern Warlords, which caused China to become fragmented; and I have personally witnessed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's corruption, extortion, initiation of civil war, and massacre of the people during its more than 20 years of rule over mainland China, committing all kinds of evil deeds. In the long years of the past, many advanced figures in the country fought countless struggles against domestic and foreign oppressors in order to save China and change the fate of their country. However, because they did not find the right path, they all failed one after another.
    Only the Chinese Communist Party began to lead the Chinese people in a great people's revolutionary struggle more than thirty years ago, and after achieving a great victory in 1949 and establishing the People's Republic of China, China fundamentally changed its face. In the short span of five years, everyone has seen that the ancient and backward China is being led by the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, with an unprecedented scale and speed, clearing away the filth left over from thousands of years of history, and achieving unprecedented achievements and victories in internal affairs, foreign affairs, military affairs, politics, economy, culture and education. It ended the status of a colony and an appendage under the rule of foreign imperialism and became a truly independent country; it ended the long-standing rule of feudalism; it ended the long-term chaos and realized domestic peace, creating an unprecedented unified situation on the entire mainland of our country; it ended the state of powerlessness of the people in a very wide range and promoted a high degree of democracy; and it started the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, guiding the people of the whole country to march towards the prosperous and happy socialist society.
    Recently, our country convened the First Session of the First National People's Congress, passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and elected new national leaders. Our people's democratic system has been further developed.
    The result of these brilliant achievements is that our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, and the lives of the people are becoming increasingly free and happy.
    However, the American warmongers and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have consistently been enemies of the Chinese people.
    After the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan under the protection of the United States, the evil deeds they have done in collusion with American imperialism are countless. But in general, their evil purpose is to attack China, destroy the peaceful and happy life of the Chinese people, destroy peace in the Far East and the world, and further provoke a world war. This attempt by the American aggressor group has become more obvious and more frenzied after its repeated failures on the two fronts of Korea and Indochina.
    Therefore, the people of the whole country must realize that in order to protect and develop our happy life, consolidate the security of our country, and safeguard the integrity of our country's sacred territory and sovereignty, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. If we do not do so, our great construction cause will be threatened at any time. We absolutely cannot allow this situation to exist.
    At the same time, the people of the whole country also have a desire: the more free and happy our lives are, the more we cannot forget that there are still eight million Chinese people in Taiwan who are still living a miserable and dark life. Similarly, after countless martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves to win the true independence of the country, we can never allow our territory of Taiwan to be occupied by American imperialists.
    The magnificent rivers and mountains of Taiwan, with an area of more than 35,900 square kilometers, are the sacred territory of our country; the eight million people of Taiwan are our beloved compatriots. But this land is still being trampled on by the American warmongers and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique; and the eight million compatriots are still suffering from their oppression and persecution. Can the six hundred million Chinese people who have stood up allow this shameful state to exist? Can we sit idly by and ignore the Taiwan compatriots who are in dire straits? Therefore, the struggle to liberate Taiwan is not only a matter of safeguarding the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty for the Chinese people, but also a sacred responsibility that cannot be shirked for the eight million Taiwan compatriots.
    Taiwan compatriots were enslaved by Japanese imperialists for fifty-one years in the past; but they never succumbed to Japanese imperialists. As early as 1895, when the shameless Manchu Qing rulers ceded Taiwan to Japanese imperialists, all Taiwan compatriots vowed to resist to the death, and compatriots from all over the mainland responded one after another, which I also personally witnessed when I was a student in my youth. Taiwan compatriots also launched the most heroic struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on February 28, 1947, which unfortunately failed due to being isolated and helpless. Now the people of the motherland are determined to liberate Taiwan, determined to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who have committed heinous crimes, and determined to enable the Taiwan compatriots who are under the tyrannical rule of Chiang Kai-shek to return to the embrace of the motherland and jointly enjoy a free and happy life. For Taiwan compatriots, this is a great joy and a major event that is closely related to the fate of Taiwan compatriots.
    Patriotic Taiwan compatriots with revolutionary traditions will surely inherit the glorious revolutionary traditions, promote patriotism, strengthen unity, gather strength, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army.
    Some people feel that the struggle to liberate Taiwan may affect the large-scale economic construction of our country; this idea is obviously wrong. On the contrary, the struggle to liberate Taiwan will help promote and ensure the progress of domestic peaceful construction.
    The reason is very clear. In recent years, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the instigation and assistance of American aggressors, has increasingly carried out harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas, plundering coastal fishermen, robbing and detaining ships from our country and other countries that come to our country for trade, and sending and airdropping spies to our mainland to carry out sabotage work. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, relying on the protection of the US Navy, Army and Air Force and the training of the US "Military Assistance Advisory Group," is still reorganizing its army, clamoring to prepare to attack the mainland, vainly attempting to restore their heinous fascist rule.
    Is it beneficial to domestic construction to allow this situation to continue? Or is it beneficial to domestic construction to liberate Taiwan, completely destroy the lair of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and eliminate the seeds of war? Obviously, it is the latter rather than the former that is beneficial to the progress of domestic construction.
    The practice of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea also vividly provides proof. When the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea began, some people could not help but worry. But the result of the three-year war proved that because the Chinese people overcame various difficulties and carried out heroic struggles, this anti-aggression armed struggle did not cause the stagnation and interruption of our social transformation and economic recovery work. On the contrary, it not only played a great role in promoting the transformation and recovery work in all aspects of our country, but also "greatly inspired the great patriotism and internationalism of our people, infinitely strengthened the spiritual and political unity of our people, significantly improved our country's international status, vigorously expanded the world people's movement against war and in defense of peace, and strengthened the strength and influence of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union" (Premier Zhou Enlai's political report at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference). Therefore, the idea that carrying out the liberation of Taiwan will affect the large-scale construction of our country is completely unfounded.
    Some people say that our country has always advocated peace. We have stopped the Korean War, restored peace in Indochina, and are now liberating Taiwan. Isn't this in conflict with our country's peace policy? Will it cause tension in the international situation?
    Such a view is obviously extremely wrong. Liberating Taiwan is our country's established policy and is not a new issue. From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, it declared that "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China must be responsible for carrying out the people's liberation war to the end, liberating all the territory of China, and completing the cause of unifying China." (Article 2 of the General Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) In June and July 1950, my Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai "Statement on opposing President Truman's statement of June 27 and the US armed aggression against our country," and "Statement to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, and forwarded to the member states of the Security Council regarding the resolution of the United Nations Security Council on the Korean issue," solemnly declared on behalf of my Central People's Government: "The entire people of our country will unite as one and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the US aggressors." "No matter what military obstruction the US government takes, the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan." Now we are emphasizing the task of liberating Taiwan even more strongly, which is completely timely and necessary.
    Our country has always advocated peace, adhered to a peace policy, and opposed war and aggression policies. This is determined by our country's people's democratic system. However, the American imperialists, who harbor a crazy ambition to dominate the world, have not stopped interfering in and aggressing against our country in the five years since the victory of our people's revolution. It has continuously attempted to carry out armed intervention and war threats against the People's Republic of China from the three fronts of Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. It was only through the resolute struggle of the Korean and Chinese people and the Vietnamese people, as well as the peace-loving people of the world, that the US imperialists were forced to cease fire in Korea and promoted the restoration of peace in Indochina. This shows that only struggle can win peace, and that fear of the enemy will only lead to war from foreign aggression. Countless Chinese and foreign historical experiences and lessons have proved this truth. Now, after the ceasefire in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the American aggressor group, in order to create new tensions, has recently stepped up its use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who fled to Taiwan to carry out harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas, attempting to expand armed intervention. Therefore, in order to further ease the international tension, in order to consolidate and expand the peaceful situation created by the ceasefire in Indochina, and in order to implement the peace policy that our government has always followed, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Therefore, the struggle to liberate Taiwan is not only not contrary to our country's consistent peace policy, but is precisely an important step in defending peace and eliminating war. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his foreign policy report: "The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend world peace."
    Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. We absolutely cannot allow the United States to occupy Taiwan and interfere in our liberation of Taiwan. At the same time, we also resolutely oppose absurd proposals such as "neutralizing" Taiwan and "placing it under UN trusteeship." We must liberate Taiwan, and all armed forces and all military personnel of the United States must completely withdraw from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other islands belonging to China.
    We firmly believe that with the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the broad masses of peace-loving people around the world, as long as we can strengthen unity and intensify our work, our struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely overcome all obstacles and achieve final victory.

    加强团结，加强工作，为解放台湾的神圣事业而奋斗！
    中国民主建国会总会常务委员会主任委员　黄炎培
    一九五四年八月十一日，中华人民共和国政府通过决议，号召全国人民和中国人民解放军，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾，完成中国人民的神圣解放事业而奋斗。八月二十二日，中国各民主党派各人民团体发表了联合宣言，向全世界宣告，台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。
    两个多月来，大家都看到，解放台湾的号召，得到了国内人民热烈的拥护，已成为一种伟大的物质的力量。工人农民保证积极生产，以实际力量支援解放台湾，人民解放军以无比兴奋的心情接受任务，保证增强战斗力量，其他各阶层的人民也纷纷表示要以具体行动支援解放台湾，争取消灭蒋介石卖国集团的彻底胜利。
    解放台湾的斗争，也获得了国外爱好和平人民的深厚的同情和广泛的支持。
    为什么解放台湾的斗争能够得到这样广泛的拥护和支持呢？这是由于解放台湾的斗争是正义的事业。正义的事业，就一定能够团结全国人民，并能够得到一切国际朋友的支持。正义的事业，正如毛泽东主席所教导我们的，是任何敌人也攻不破的。
    我国人民都清楚，也都记得：从鸦片战争以后的百余年间，中华民族灾难重重，在对外关系上，当时我国实际上丧失了独立国家的地位，广大人民过着非常痛苦的日子。我今年七十七岁了。我亲眼看到过满清政府的腐败无能和丧权辱国；亲眼看到过北洋军阀的割据内战，把中国造成了四分五裂的局面；更亲眼看到过蒋介石卖国集团在统治中国大陆的二十多年中，贪污腐化，横征暴敛，发动内战，屠杀人民，做尽了人间恶事。在过去的漫长岁月里，国内许多先进人物，为了救中国，为了改变自己国家的命运，曾经对内外的压迫者进行过无数斗争。但是由于他们没有找到正确的道路，都先后的失败了。
    只有中国共产党在三十多年前开始领导中国人民进行伟大的人民革命斗争，在一九四九年取得了伟大的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国以后，中国才根本地改变了它的面貌。在五年的短短时间内，每个人都看到：古老的落后的中国正在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明和正确领导下，以史无前例的规模和速度，廓清了几千年来历史上遗留下来的污垢，并在内政、外交、军事、政治、经济以及文化教育等方面获得了空前的成就和胜利。它结束了在外国帝国主义统治下的殖民地和附属国的地位，成为一个真正独立的国家；结束了年代久远的封建主义的统治；结束了长期的混乱局面，实现了国内和平，造成我国全部大陆空前统一的局面；它在极广泛的范围内结束了人民无权的状况，发扬了高度的民主；它并开始了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，引导全国人民向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前途迈进。
    最近我国召开了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，通过了中华人民共和国宪法，选举了新的国家领导工作人员。我国人民民主制度，获得了更进一步的发展。
    这些辉煌灿烂的成就所带来的结果，是我们的国家日益趋向繁荣强盛，人民的生活日益趋向自由幸福。
    但是，美国好战分子和蒋介石卖国集团，却一贯地和中国人民为敌。
    蒋介石卖国集团在美国庇护下逃到台湾以后，勾结美帝国主义所做的罪恶勾当，真是数不尽，说不完。但总起来说，他们的罪恶的目的就是要进攻中国，破坏中国人民的和平幸福生活，破坏远东和世界的和平，并进而挑起世界大战。美国侵略集团的这种企图，当它在朝鲜、印度支那两个战线上连续遭到失败后，暴露得更加显明，更加疯狂。
    因此，全国人民都必须认识：要保护和发展我们幸福的生活，巩固我们国家的安全，维护我国神圣领土和主权的完整，就一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。不这样做，我们伟大的建设事业，就会随时受到威胁。我们是绝对不能允许这种情况存在的。
    同时，全国人民也都有一种志愿：我们的生活越自由、越幸福，就越不能忘记还有八百万在台湾的中国人民仍然过着悲惨黑暗的日子。同样，在经过无数先烈流血牺牲，争得了国家的真正独立地位之后，也就决不能允许我国领土台湾为美帝国主义者所侵占。
    台湾三万五千九百余平方公里的锦绣河山，是我国的神圣领土；台湾八百万的人民是我们亲爱的同胞。而这块土地现在仍然为美国好战分子和蒋介石卖国集团所践踏；八百万的同胞，也依然受着他们的压迫和残害。站立起来了的六万万中国人民，能够允许这种可耻的状态的存在吗？能够坐视台湾的同胞处在水深火热之中而置之不顾吗？所以解放台湾的斗争，对中国人民来说，不仅是维护国家领土和主权的完整问题，而且是对八百万台湾同胞义不容辞的神圣的责任。
    台湾同胞过去受日本帝国主义者奴役了五十一年；但一直没有向日本帝国主义者屈服过。远在一八九五年无耻的满清统治者把台湾割让给日本帝国主义者的时候，台湾全体同胞誓死反抗，大陆各地同胞纷纷响应，这也是我在青年上学时代亲眼看到的。台湾同胞在一九四七年二月二十八日也曾经对蒋介石卖国集团进行过最英勇的斗争，都不幸地由于孤军无援而失败了。现在祖国人民决心解放台湾，决心消灭罪恶滔天的蒋介石卖国集团，决心使处在蒋介石虐政之下的台湾同胞，能够回到祖国怀抱，共同享受自由幸福的生活。这对台湾同胞说来，是一件天大的喜事，是和台湾同胞休戚相关的大事情。
    爱国的、有革命传统的台湾同胞，一定会继承光荣的革命传统，发扬爱国主义，加强团结，积聚力量，准备迎接人民解放军。
    有人觉得解放台湾的斗争，可能会影响我国大规模经济建设的进行；这种想法显然是错误的。恰恰相反，解放台湾的斗争，将有助于推动并保障国内和平建设的进行。
    理由是很清楚的。几年来，蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略者的指使和援助下，对我国大陆和沿海日益猖獗地进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，劫掠沿海渔民，劫夺并扣留我国及各国前来我国通商的船舶，并派遣和空投特务到我国大陆进行暗害工作。最近蒋介石卖国集团依靠美国海陆空军的庇护和美国“军事援助顾问团”的训练，还在进行整编军队，叫嚣准备进攻大陆，妄想借此恢复它们的万恶的法西斯统治。
    让这种状态继续存在下去，有利于国内建设呢？还是解放台湾，彻底摧毁蒋介石卖国集团的巢穴，消灭了战争的种子，有利于国内的建设呢？显然的，有利于国内建设进行的，是后者而不是前者。
    抗美援朝斗争的实践，也生动地提供了证明。抗美援朝运动开始的时候，有些人不免担心。但是三年战争的结果证明，由于中国人民克服了种种困难，进行英勇的斗争，使这一反侵略的武装斗争，并没有引起我们社会改造和经济恢复工作的停滞和中断，相反地，它不仅对我们国家各方面改造和恢复工作起了伟大的推动作用，而且“大大地激发了我国人民伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，无限地加强了我国人民精神上和政治上的团结，显著地提高了我国的国际地位，有力地扩大了世界人民反对战争保卫和平的运动，并加强了以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营的力量和影响”（周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的政治报告）。因此，认为要进行解放台湾，会影响我国大规模建设的想法，是完全没有根据的。
    有人说，我国一向主张和平。我们使得朝鲜战争停止了，印度支那和平恢复了，又在这时进行解放台湾，岂不是和我国和平政策有冲突了吗？会不会引起国际局势的紧张呢？
    这样的看法显然是极端错误的。解放台湾，是我国已定的方针，并不是新问题。中华人民共和国从成立那一天起，即声明“中华人民共和国中央人民政府必须负责将人民解放战争进行到底，解放中国全部领土，完成统一中国的事业。”（中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领总纲第二条）一九五○年六月和七月间，我周恩来总理兼外交部长“关于反对美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日声明和美国武装侵略我国的声明”，以及“为反对联合国安全理事会关于朝鲜问题的决议事致联合国秘书长赖伊并转安全理事会各会员国的声明”中，曾代表我中央人民政府郑重声明：“我国全体人民，必将万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。”“不管美国政府采取任何军事阻挠，中国人民抱定决心，必将要解放台湾”。现在我们更加强调地提出解放台湾的任务，是完全适时和必要的。
    我国一向主张和平，坚持和平政策，反对战争政策和侵略政策，这是我们国家的人民民主制度决定了的。可是，怀抱着称霸世界的疯狂野心的美国帝国主义者，在我国人民革命胜利后的五年间，却一直没有停止过对我国的干涉和侵略。它不断地企图从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那三个战线上进行对中华人民共和国的武装干涉和战争威胁。经过朝、中人民和越南人民以及世界爱好和平人民的坚决斗争，才迫使美帝国主义在朝鲜停战下来，并促进了印度支那和平的恢复。这就说明，只有斗争才可以赢得和平，而对敌人的畏缩则反会招致外来侵略的战争。无数的中外历史经验教训，都证明了这一真理。现在，朝鲜停战，印度支那恢复和平后，美国侵略集团为了制造新的紧张局势，最近更加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，企图扩大武装干涉。因此，为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，为了巩固和扩大由于印度支那停战而产生的和平局面，为了贯彻我国政府一向遵循的和平政策，就必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。所以，解放台湾的斗争，不仅不与我国一向的和平政策相违背，恰恰是保卫和平，消灭战争的一个重要步骤。正如周恩来总理在外交报告中所指出的：“中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是保卫世界和平的斗争。”
    台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政。我们绝对不能容许美国侵占台湾和干涉我国解放台湾。同时，我们也坚决反对所谓把台湾“中立化”和“交联合国托管”之类的荒谬主张。我们一定要解放台湾，美国的各种武装力量和一切军事人员必须自台湾、澎湖列岛和其他属于中国的岛屿完全撤走。
    我们坚信，有中国共产党和毛主席的正确的领导，有全世界广大爱好和平人民的支援，只要我们能够加强团结，加强工作，我们解放台湾的斗争，就一定能够排除各种阻碍，取得最后的胜利。
