Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 16th: The eight state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao further reduced the amount of cotton used for eight major yarn counts in October compared to the average cotton consumption in the third quarter. This month, they saved a total of over 87,300 jin of raw cotton. The yarn spun and cloth made from this saved cotton could provide enough clothing for over 50,000 people to each make a set of clothes.

In the third quarter of this year, these eight factories had already reversed the past trend of cotton consumption exceeding quotas in the third quarter. In October, workers in each factory further launched a labor competition to improve quality and save cotton. Workers at the Second Cotton Textile Factory separated the waste cotton from the front and rear of the carding machines and recycled it into low-count yarn. After the fine yarn workers at the First Cotton Textile Factory further reduced defective yarn and recycled silk, they saved more than 240 jin of cotton throughout the month. Workers in the blowing room of the Seventh Cotton Textile Factory picked up white cotton when sweeping the floor and even went deep into the "underground passages" to find "underground passage cotton," selecting the cotton with the best fibers. These saving actions ensured a further reduction in cotton consumption in October. The cotton consumption per piece of 21-count and 23-count yarn at the First, Third, and Seventh factories, and 32-count yarn at the Second and Sixth factories, has been reduced to below 390 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 13th: Workers building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway have handed over 4.5 billion yuan in increased production and savings to the state.

Since launching a labor competition focusing on technological innovation in June this year, all road-building workers have put forward many rationalization proposals, greatly improving work efficiency and reducing costs. For example, the adoption of the "pickaxe digging and loading soil method" and the "three-sided soil loading, five-person one-side unloading method" have both improved work efficiency by more than double. In order to increase production and save money, the workers also put forward the slogan of "no stopping work in light rain" and used their spare time to collect cow dung as fuel, saving more than 84,000 jin of coal and more than 100 million yuan in transportation costs.

Currently, the road-building workers are striving to increase production and save another 3 billion yuan for the state on the harsh plateau.

    青岛八个纺织厂十月份节约原棉八万多斤
    修筑青藏公路的职工交给国家增产节约款四十五亿元
    【新华社青岛十六日电】青岛八个国营棉纺织厂十月份八种主要纱支的用棉量又比第三季度的平均用棉量降低，这个月内共计节约了八万七千三百多斤原棉。用这批节约的原棉纺成纱、制成布，可供五万多人每人做一套衣服。
    这八个厂在今年第三季度就已改变了往年第三季度用棉量超过定额的情况。十月份，各厂职工进一步开展了提高质量、节约用棉的劳动竞赛。第二棉纺织厂的职工把梳棉机前车肚和后车肚的落花分开来处理，回用到低支纱去。第一棉纺织厂细纱工人进一步减少了坏纱和回丝后，全月就节约棉花二百四十多斤。第七棉纺织厂清花车间的职工扫地时把白花都拣起来，还深入到“地巷”中搜出“地巷花”，把其中纤维好的棉花选出来。这些节约行动都保证了十月份用棉量的进一步降低。第一、第三和第七三个厂的二十一支和二十三支纱以及第二、第六两个厂的三十二支纱，每一件的用棉量都已降低到三百九十斤以下。
    【新华社西宁十三日电】修筑青藏公路的职工已向国家上交增产节约款四十五亿元。
    全体筑路职工，从今年六月展开以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛以后，提出很多合理化建议，大大提高了工作效率，降低了成本。如采用“镐锄挖装土法”和“三面装土，五人一面卸土法”等，都提高工作效率一倍多。为了增产节约，职工们还提出“小雨不停工”的口号，并利用工余时间拾牛粪作燃料，节省煤八万四千多斤，运费一亿多元。
    现在，筑路职工正在严寒的高原上，争取再给国家增产节约三十亿元。
