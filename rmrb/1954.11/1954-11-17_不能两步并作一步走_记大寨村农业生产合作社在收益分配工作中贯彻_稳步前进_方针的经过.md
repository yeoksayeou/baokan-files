    Cannot Take Two Steps as One
    -- Recording the Dazhai Village Agricultural Production Cooperative's Implementation of the "Steady Advance" Policy in Income Distribution
    Gao Jin, Yu Shan
    The Dazhai Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yuxian County, Shanxi Province, began its trial operation in 1951 and was officially established in the spring of 1952. Over the past four years, the Dazhai cooperative has gradually grown and strengthened, following the "steady advance" policy. It has developed from a small cooperative to a medium-sized cooperative including all 53 households in the village, demonstrating great superiority in production. In the past four years, this cooperative has built 137 mu of beach land, transformed slopes into terraces, and merged small plots into large ones. It has adopted new animal-powered farm tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows and seeders, and improved cultivation techniques. As a result, agricultural output has increased year by year. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the average yield per mu was 110 jin of grain. In 1950, the year before the trial operation of the agricultural cooperative, it was 155 jin. In 1953, despite suffering from natural disasters such as spring frost, summer floods, and autumn drought, it still achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu was 219 jin and 12 liang. This year, it is confident of completing the grain and oil production plan, with a grain yield per mu more than 47 jin higher than last year, an average of 267 jin per mu. Thus, this year's land yield may exceed the land yield of 1950 (the year before the establishment of the cooperative) by 72 (strong) percent; exceeding the pre-war yield by 142.7 (strong) percent.
      A Fierce Debate
    With the continuous growth of output, members had inconsistent demands regarding the remuneration for labor and land in the distribution of income. As early as the beginning of spring plowing this year, Zhang Mofu, a member with little land and strong labor, went to the home of cooperative chairman Zhang Ziquan to express his opinion, saying, "Chairman, will the four-six profit-sharing method of our cooperative change this year? If it doesn't change, I'll propose to withdraw from the cooperative as soon as possible. With my five-foot tall frame, capable of carrying, picking, plowing, and harrowing, I can earn ten or eight shi of grain working as a long-term or short-term laborer, why should I work hard in the cooperative for a year and end up 'wasting effort for nothing'?" New member Zhang Wanqian also suggested: "If it's four-six, a household like mine, with two laborers, working hard all year round, won't earn as much as a household with more land." During the formulation of the cooperative's constitution, the issue of income distribution was discussed the most and argued the most fiercely. Zhang Mofu, Zhang Wanqian, Zhang Zaiyuan, and other members with little land and strong labor advocated for complete remuneration based on labor, simply abolishing land dividends, or at least reducing land dividends. They said: "From spring plowing and sowing to autumn harvest and threshing, which production process can do without labor? The grain income from the land is all earned by labor. It is reasonable to pay entirely according to labor." Zhang Bucheng and other land-rich households argued: "Farmers depend entirely on a piece of land to live. Land is the lifeline. Without land, no matter how capable the labor is, grain cannot grow from stones." Zhang Shoupeng, who had strong labor, immediately retorted, "No need to look far, just compare the four years since our cooperative was established. We engaged in land construction -- improving the soil, transforming mountain slopes into terraces, and turning river beaches into fertile fields. Land that didn't yield anything in the past now yields, and land that yielded little now yields more. What does this depend on if not labor?" Zhang Genhai added, "Last year, we suffered from three disasters. The land within the cooperative in Beigoukou and the land of individual farmer Zhang Maocheng had the same geological conditions, separated only by a boundary. Both suffered from waterlogging. We drained water, supported seedlings, added hoeing, and added fertilizer in a timely manner, yielding 320 jin of grain per mu, while Maocheng's yielded only 130 jin. Does increased production depend on land or labor?" Through fierce debate, and especially with vivid facts presented, Zhang Bucheng and other land-rich households gradually changed their thinking that "land is the lifeline" and realized the principle that "land is dead property, and increased production depends on labor," agreeing to reduce land dividends.
    The Result of Being Eager to Abolish Land Dividends
    After the members with more land agreed to reduce land dividends, the party members and some activists in the cooperative, eager to transition to a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative, proposed the method of "abolishing land dividends and paying entirely according to labor." After this method was proposed, most members with neither too much nor too little land and labor calculated for themselves and believed that abolishing land dividends would neither give them much more nor put them at a disadvantage. So they said, "Let's abolish it then, no matter what, this year will be better than last year." A small number of relatively wealthy middle peasant members, led by Zhang Bucheng, although feeling that their income might decrease after abolishing land dividends, strongly disagreed in their hearts, but they believed that "the general trend is towards the socialist road anyway, sooner or later it's the same," so they didn't object on the surface either. Some elderly members with weak labor had the greatest concerns. They said:
  "Our labor is weak, and we earn few workdays. If land dividends are abolished, how can we get grain? Those with labor will eat their fill, we'll eat half; they'll eat thick porridge, we'll drink thin porridge. Socialism is good, but it's hard to enjoy without labor." Old man Zhang Wanxiang, who was over seventy years old, said: "Alas, I can't carry or pick, and if I don't earn workdays, I won't get grain. I'm about to be buried in the ground, and I'll still have to starve for two days before I die." People like them were a minority in the cooperative, and their opinions did not receive the attention they deserved. As a result, the opinion to abolish land dividends was considered to be agreed upon by everyone, and a resolution was made, deciding that this year's distribution would be entirely based on labor.
    Unexpectedly, after this decision was made, a series of problems quickly occurred within the cooperative. When mobilizing everyone to invest in land and implement sheep grazing on the land, middle peasant Zhang Bucheng proposed not investing and not grazing. His reasoning was: to save grain from grazing in preparation for making a living after the abolition of land dividends. Old man Zhang Wanxiang, fearing that he would "not be able to survive," proposed to withdraw from the cooperative. Old man Zhang Zhenlin, fearing that livestock would also "belong to the collective for nothing" like land, secretly sold his cattle. In short, middle peasant members with more land and elderly members with weak or no labor were either no longer active in production or wanted to withdraw from the cooperative.
      Conditions Must Be Actively Created
    After the problem occurred, it attracted the attention of the party branch. After instructions from the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Yuci Prefectural Committee, the party branch organized all party members and activists to study again the tenth item of the third article of the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" regarding how agricultural cooperatives in their current form can transition to advanced, fully socialist agricultural cooperatives. During the study discussion, party member (cooperative cadre) Zhang Shoupeng said: "The document says that the transition from semi-socialism to complete socialism should not make peasants feel sudden, and we neglected this point. No wonder some middle peasant households said: Abolishing land dividends is good, but you are moving too fast, and we can't keep up." Party member (deputy director) Zhang Genhai said: "Because we were preparing to abolish land dividends, Lin Laohan secretly sold his large castrated bull without telling the cooperative cadres. This shows that the masses' awareness has not been raised, and an early transition is not beneficial to production." Zhang Genjin said: "We often say to implement the class line, rely on the poor peasants, and unite the middle peasants. I think we forgot this principle when we abolished land dividends this year, so middle peasant households have opinions, and some poor households without labor also have opinions." After this discussion, everyone further understood the spirit of "steady progress" and realized that it was wrong to be eager to transition when conditions were not ripe. Zhang Ziquan, deputy secretary of the township branch and director of the cooperative, made a summary speech based on everyone's opinions. He said: "According to the spirit of the document, I think there should be two conditions for abolishing land dividends: one is the economic condition, that is, the cooperative's production must have greater development, and there must be more production avenues, and the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund must also accumulate a lot, so that everyone has work to do all year round, those with more and stronger labor increase their income, and those with less and weaker labor also increase their income, and those cooperative members who lack labor ability can also get enough relief and subsidies from the public welfare fund to guarantee their lives. In this way, people like Zhang Wanxiang will not withdraw from the cooperative. The other is the ideological condition, that is, we must constantly educate the cooperative members and improve everyone's socialist awareness, so that they realize that increasing income depends on the power of collective labor, not on land. In this way, middle peasants will not feel heartache for their 'lifeline' when land dividends are abolished. If we want to move forward, we must move forward without being 'left' or 'right,' and we cannot take two steps as one." The result of the study and discussion improved the understanding of party members and activists and overcame their rash emotions. Finally, the resolution to abolish land dividends was canceled, and the original proportional dividend system was changed to a land quantitative dividend system (ie, fixed rent system).
    Reasonable Distribution, Everyone Satisfied
    In the autumn, through production estimation and calculation, the cooperative's 495 mu of autumn land is expected to yield 132,790 jin of grain this year. Subsidiary income is equivalent to more than 23,500 jin of grain. The total income from both is 156,290 jin of grain. The total workdays in the cooperative are 5,540. The total land assessed yield is 708 shi. The principles of distribution are: 1. Distribute mainly by labor, taking into account reasonable remuneration for land. The specific method is to adopt the "land quantitative dividend system." 2. Support national construction and take care of the needs of cooperative members. The land dividend is set at 35 jin per shi of assessed yield. After deducting land dividends, the total investment in this year's production (livestock, remuneration, fertilizer, feed, seeds, medicines, etc.), 6.5 percent of the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, and administrative management fees from the total income, the remainder is distributed to cooperative members according to workdays. According to this calculation result, each workday receives 11.5 jin of agricultural grain and 4 jin of sideline grain, totaling 15.5 jin per workday. It was also decided to combine the state's unified purchase of several agricultural products, agricultural tax, and the needs of cooperative members in income distribution, adopting the method of "collective sale of surplus grain, unified payment of public grain." The specific approach is to democratically discuss and stipulate the standard of food grain sufficient for each person's livelihood, and calculate and deduct the total amount of food grain required by each household accordingly. From each household's total grain income, after deducting the total amount of food grain required, the amount payable, and the next year's production investment, the remaining grain is sold to the state. After estimating production and formulating a plan, the result is that the income of each cooperative member household has increased compared to last year. Zhang Bucheng, a middle peasant member with more land and general labor (a family of nine, two laborers, and 43.31 mu of land), could earn 5,320 jin if calculated according to the abolition of land dividends, and 6,784 jin if calculated according to the land quantitative dividend method, with land and labor combined. After deducting the burden, the income is 348 jin more than abolishing land dividends, and 960 jin more than last year. Zhang Mofu, a cooperative member with less land and strong labor (a family of two, one strong laborer, and 7.09 mu of land), could earn 3,386 jin if calculated according to the abolition of land dividends, and 3,555 jin if calculated according to the land quantitative dividend method. After deducting the burden, the income is 156 jin less than abolishing land dividends, and 610 jin more than last year. In short, using the quantitative dividend distribution method, the income of poor and middle peasant households has increased, so everyone is satisfied. According to preliminary estimates, the cooperative can sell at least 32,000 jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction.

    不能两步并作一步走
    ——记大寨村农业生产合作社在收益分配工作中贯彻“稳步前进”方针的经过
    高锦　玉山
    山西省榆社县大寨村农业生产合作社是一九五一年开始试办，一九五二年春季正式建立的。四年来，大寨社沿着“稳步前进”的方针，逐步发展壮大，由一个小型社发展成为包括全村五十三户的中型社，在生产上显示了巨大的优越性。四年中，这个社共修滩地一百三十七亩，把坡地修成了梯田，小块地合成大块地；采用了双轮双铧犁、播种机等新式畜力农具，改进了耕作技术。因此，农业产量逐年上升。抗日战争前，每亩土地平均产粮一百一十斤。一九五零年即试办农业社的前一年产一百五十五斤。一九五三年遭受了春冻、夏涝、秋旱等自然灾害，但仍然获得了丰收。每亩平均产二百一十九斤十二两。今年有把握完成粮食和油料生产计划，每亩粮食可比去年增产四十七斤多。即平均每亩产二百六十七斤。这样，今年土地产量可超过一九五零年（办社前一年）土地产量百分之七十二
  （强）；超过战前产量的百分之一百四十二点七
  （强）。
      一场激烈的争论
    随着产量的不断增长，在分配收益的问题上，社员对劳力和土地的报酬有了不一致的要求。还在今年开始春耕的时候，土地少劳力强的社员张磨福就找到社长张志全家里去提意见说：“社长，咱社今年四、六分红的办法变不变？如果不变，咱就趁早提出来要退社。就凭咱这一条五尺高的汉子，能担能挑，会犁会耙，到那儿扛个长工短工，还愁赚不下十石八石粮，何必在社里辛辛苦苦的受一年，到秋后落个‘白给野鸡刨窝’。”新社员张万千也提出意见：“要是四、六分，像俺这户，父子两个劳力，扑腾一年也不如人家地多户收益大。”在制订社章时，对收益分配问题讨论得最多，争吵得最激烈，张磨福、张万千、张在元等土地少劳力强的社员主张完全按劳付酬，干脆取消土地分益，至少也要降低土地分益。他们说：“从春耕播种到秋收打场，那一个生产过程离开劳力能行？土地上收入的粮食都是依靠劳力换来的，完全按劳取酬才合理。”以张补成等为首的地多户则说：“庄稼人全凭着一圪塔土活哩，土地是命根，离开了土地，任凭劳力有多大能耐，也不能从石头上长出谷子来。”劳力强的张寿朋马上反驳他说：“远的不用说，就比咱社办起来这四年吧，咱搞土地建设——改良土壤、把山坡地修成梯田、把河滩变沃野，过去不收的现在收了，过去收的少的现在收多了，这不凭劳力凭什么？”张更孩补充说：“去年三次受灾，北沟口社内土地和个体农民张毛成土地地质一样，只隔一道地界，同样受了涝灾，咱们及时排水扶苗、加锄加肥，每亩收谷三百二十斤，而毛成的只收了一百三十斤，到底增产靠土地还是靠劳力？”通过激烈的争论，特别是活生生的事实摆在面前，张补成等地多户的“地是命根子”的思想逐渐转变，认识到“地是死财产、增产靠劳动”的道理，同意了降低土地分益。
    急于取消土地分益的结果
    土地多的社员们同意了降低土地分益以后，社内党员和一部分积极分子因为急于要求过渡到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社，便提出了“取消土地分益，完全按劳取酬”的办法。这一办法提出后，大部分土地、劳力都不多不少的社员自己算了算账，认为取消了土地分益，既多分不下，也吃不了亏，于是他们说：“取消就取消了吧，不管怎样今年总比去年强。”以张补成为首的一少部分较富裕中农社员，虽然觉着取消土地分益自己收入可能要减少，心里十分不赞成，但他们认为“大势所趋，社会主义的路总得走，迟早一样”，所以表面上也不反对。一些劳力弱的年老社员顾虑最大，他们说：
  “咱劳力弱，劳动日少，取消土地分益，咱哪还能分下粮食。人家有劳力的吃饱肚，咱吃半肚；人家吃稠的，咱喝稀的。社会主义好，没有劳力难享受。”七十多岁的张万祥老汉说：“唉，担不能担，挑不能挑，挣不下劳动日就分不下粮食。快入土的人了，临死还得挨两天饿。”像他们这样的人在社内是少数，他们的意见没有获得应有的重视。结果，取消土地分益的意见算是大家都同意了，便做成了决议，决定今年的分配完全按劳取酬。
    没想到这样决定以后，社内很快发生了一连串的问题。在动员大家对土地投资和实行羊群卧地时，中农张补成提出了不投资不卧地的意见。他的说法是：要省下卧地的粮食，准备取消土地分红后糊口过日子。张万祥老汉怕“活不下去了”，就提出来要退社。张贞林老汉怕牲口也像土地一样“白白归了集体”，偷偷地把牛卖了。总之，土地多的中农社员和老弱无劳力的社员不是生产不积极了，便是想退社。
      必须积极创造条件
    问题发生后，引起了党支部的重视。又经过中共山西省委和榆次地委的指示，党支部组织全体党员和积极分子再次学习了中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中第三条第十项关于现有形式的农业社怎样过渡到高级的完全社会主义的农业社的问题。在学习讨论中，党员（社务干部）张寿朋说：“文件上说，由半社会主义过渡到完全社会主义要使农民感到不突然，咱们就忽略了这一点，怪不得有些中农户说：取消土地分红好是好，就是你们走的太快，我们跟不上。”党员（副社长）张更孩说：“因为准备取消土地分红，林老汉才把他的大犍牛瞒着社干部卖掉了。可见群众觉悟还没有提高，过早过渡对生产是没利的。”张根金说：“咱们时常说贯彻阶级路线，依靠贫农，团结中农，我看咱们今年取消土地分红就是忘了这个原则了，所以中农户有意见，一些无劳力的困难户也有了意见。”经过这一讨论，大家进一步体会到“稳步前进”的精神，认识到条件不成熟，急于过渡是错误的。乡支部副书记、社长张志全根据大家的意见作了总结性的发言，他说：“根据文件精神，我看要取消土地分红要有两方面的条件：一方面是经济的条件，就是要社的生产有了更大的发展，还要生产门路多，公积金、公益金也积累得多，大家一年四季有活干，劳力多的强的增加收入，劳力少的弱的同样也增加收入，那些缺乏劳动能力的社员也能从公益金得到足够的救济和补助，保证他们的生活。这样，像张万祥一样的人就不会退社了。另一方面是思想条件，就是我们必须经常向社员进行教育，提高大家的社会主义觉悟，使他们认识到增加收入是依靠集体劳动的力量，不是依靠土地。这样，取消土地分红，中农们就不会心痛‘命根子’了。我们要前进，必须不‘左’不右地前进，不能两步并作一步走。”学习讨论的结果，提高了党员和积极分子的认识，克服了他们的冒进情绪。最后确定取消土地不分红的决议，把原来的比例分红制改成土地定量分益制（即固定租额制）。
    分配合理，大家满意
    到了秋季，通过估产计算，今年全社的四百九十五亩大秋地，预计可收粮十三万二千七百九十斤。副业收入折粮二万三千五百斤以上。两宗总共收入一十五万六千二百九十斤粮食。全社总劳动日是五千五百四十个。土地总评产是七百零八石。分的原则是：一、以劳力分配为主，兼顾土地的合理报酬，具体办法是采取“土地定量分益制”。二、既要支援国家建设，又要照顾社员需要。土地分益确定为每石评产分三十五斤。总收入扣除了土地分益、本年生产总投资（牲畜、报酬、肥料、饲料、种籽、药剂等）、百分之六点五的公积金和公益金及行政管理费后，其余按劳动日分配给社员。照此计算结果，每个劳动日分农业粮十一斤半，副业粮四斤，合计起来每个劳动日分红十五斤半。又决定在收益分配时要把国家对几种农产品的统购、农业税和社员生活需要三者结合起来处理，采用“余粮集体卖、公粮统一缴”的办法。具体做法是民主讨论规定出每人足够生活的食粮标准，依此计算扣出各户所需食粮总数。从各户的粮食总收入中，扣除所需食粮总数、应缴负担数和明年生产投资以后，其余粮食全部卖给国家。经过估计产量，制定方案，结果每户社员收入比去年有增无减。土地多劳力一般的中农社员张补成（全家九口人，二个劳力，土地四十三亩三分一厘），如按取消土地分红计算，可收入五千三百二十斤，按土地定量分益办法计算，土地劳力两项可收入六千七百八十四斤，除去负担比取消土地分红多收入三百四十八斤，比去年增加收入九百六十斤。土地少劳力强的社员张磨福（全家二口人，一个强劳力、土地七亩九厘），如按取消土地分红算，可收入三千三百八十六斤。按土地定量分益算，收入三千五百五十五斤，除去负担比取消土地分红少收入一百五十六斤，比去年增加六百一十斤。总之，采用定量分益的分配办法，贫、中农社员户户收入增加了，所以大家都满意。全社初步预算至少可卖给国家余粮三万二千斤，支援国家建设。
