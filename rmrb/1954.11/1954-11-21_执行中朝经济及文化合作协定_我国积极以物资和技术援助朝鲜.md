    Implementing the China-North Korea Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement
    China Actively Provides Material and Technical Assistance to North Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th] Since the signing of the China-North Korea Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement on November 23 last year, China has sent goods worth 2892.1 billion RMB to North Korea by the end of October this year, completing 96.4 percent of the annual delivery plan. The aid materials sent include locomotives, freight cars, passenger cars, coal and coking coal, water pumps, electric motors, cement, as well as various types of wood, steel, and a large number of daily necessities and stationery. In the heavy industry sector, workers at steel plants used the pig iron sent by China to manufacture a large number of steel ingots, and used the steel ingots to make various building materials to supply construction sites. Workers at the Hwanghae Iron Works used 4,000 tons of refractory bricks sent by China to complete the restoration of the No. 1 open hearth furnace a month ahead of schedule in June this year. In the light industry sector, workers used machinery and equipment sent by China to build a new enamel factory in Sinuiju with an annual output of more than 2 million enamelware pieces. Various rubber factories use raw materials sent by China to produce various rubber products; for rubber shoes alone, they can produce more than 23,000 pairs every day. In the transportation sector, many train drivers drive locomotives sent by China to launch campaigns for over-quota traction and safe driving for 100,000 kilometers, continuously improving transportation efficiency. Together with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, the Korean People's Army Railway Corps used equipment sent by China to repair 16 bridges including the Dadong River Railway Bridge, and built a new 86-kilometer railway from Palwon (in North Pyongan Province) to Tokchon (in South Pyongan Province).
    Over the past year, China has sent four groups of 278 technicians and technical workers to North Korea to help with reconstruction work. They are distributed among 45 different production units in North Korea's heavy industry, light industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry departments. They introduce technology and experience to North Korean workers, overcome difficulties together with North Korean workers, and actively demonstrate creativity, completing many arduous tasks ahead of schedule. Li Xuliang, a Chinese technician who assisted in the work at the Saenggiryong Kiln Factory, and the Korean workers of the factory jointly renovated Kiln No. 5, which not only reduced the firing time from the original 70 to 80 hours to 39 hours, but also reduced the amount of coal used from the original 15 tons to 5 tons.
    Many factories and mining enterprises in North Korea have technical workers who have returned from internships in China. They apply the technology they learned in China to their own country's reconstruction, and constantly achieve success. Li Peiyi, a technician from the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory who interned at the Shanghai Steel Reed Factory in our country, trial-produced steel reeds, an important part on textile machines. After several months of hard work, he finally succeeded in the trial production on October 8. This is the first time that North Korea has produced steel reeds. Li Peiyi wrote to the workers of the Shanghai Steel Reed Factory, saying: Now, in order to ensure the mass production of steel reeds needed everywhere, the workers in our factory are overfulfilling the daily production plan by 30% every day, and are determined to repay the fraternal assistance of the great Chinese people with practical actions.

    执行中朝经济及文化合作协定
    我国积极以物资和技术援助朝鲜
    【新华社平壤二十日电】从中朝经济及文化合作协定去年十一月二十三日签订后，到今年十月底为止，中国已给朝鲜送来价值二万八千九百二十一亿元人民币的物资，完成了今年度交货计划的百分之九十六点四。在已送来的援助物资中，有机车、货车、客车、煤和焦煤、抽水机、电动机、水泥，还有各种木材、钢材及大量的生活必需品和文具等。在重工业部门，炼钢厂的工人们利用中国送来的铣铁制造了大量钢锭，又用钢锭制造成各种建筑器材，供应建筑工地的需要。黄海制铁所的工人们用中国送来的四千吨耐火砖在今年六月提前一个月完成了第一号平炉的恢复工程。轻工业部门的工人们利用中国送来的机器设备，在新义州新建了年产二百多万件搪瓷器的搪瓷工厂。各橡胶工厂用中国送来的原料生产各种橡胶制品，只胶鞋一项，每天就可以生产二万三千多双。在交通运输部门，许多火车司机驾驶中国送来的机车展开超额牵引和安全行车十万公里的运动，不断地提高着运输效率。朝鲜人民军铁道部队和中国人民志愿军铁道部队一起，利用中国送来的器材修复了大同江铁道大铁桥等十六座桥梁，并新建了一条从八院（在平安北道）到德川（在平安南道）的八十六公里长的铁路。
    一年来，中国先后派遣了四批共二百七十八名技术人员和技术工人到朝鲜来帮助进行恢复建设工作，他们分布在朝鲜重工业、轻工业、化学及建筑材料工业等部门共四十五个不同的生产单位中，把技术和经验介绍给朝鲜工人，和朝鲜工人们一起克服困难，积极发挥创造性，提前完成了许多艰巨任务。到生气岭窑业工厂协助工作的中国技术工人李秀亮等，和这个工厂的朝鲜工人一起改造了五号窑，不但使烧成时间由原来的七十到八十小时缩减到三十九小时，并把用煤量从原来的十五吨减到五吨。
    在朝鲜许多厂矿企业中，都有从中国实习回来的技术工人在工作着。他们把在中国学习到的技术应用到自己祖国的恢复建设事业上，不断取得成就。从我国上海钢筘厂实习回来的平壤纺织机械制造厂技术工人李培益，试制纺织机上的重要零件钢筘，经过几个月的艰苦努力，终于在十月八日试制成功。这是朝鲜第一次制成钢筘。李培益写信给上海钢筘厂工人说：现在我们工厂工人为了保证大量生产各地所需要的钢筘，每天都超额百分之三十完成日产计划，决心以实际行动答谢伟大的中国人民对我们兄弟般的援助。
