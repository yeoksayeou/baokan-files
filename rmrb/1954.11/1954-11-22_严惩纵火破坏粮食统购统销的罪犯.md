Severely Punish Criminals Who Commit Arson and Sabotage the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain

The harvest season for autumn crops has passed, and the planned grain purchase is underway. At the same time, the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth and the planned purchase of cotton have also begun. Therefore, the people's judicial organs and public security organs in various regions should regard safeguarding planned purchases and planned supply as the central task for the most recent period, closely cooperate with local financial and trade departments and cooperatives, and promptly detect and punish all criminals who dare to sabotage planned purchases and planned supply.

Because the unified purchase and sale of grain and other important materials cut off the connection between spontaneous forces in the countryside and urban capitalism in several important aspects, it is detrimental to a small number of speculators, exploiters, and counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, they are bound to continue to carry out various acts of sabotage. The arson case recently uncovered by the Public Security Bureau of Lingling County, Hunan Province, involving the reactionary element Deng Zhenzhong, is a significant example. If we do not take timely measures, such sabotage activities may become more rampant. Last year, when the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, the people's public security organs, people's procuratorates, and people's courts in many places organized joint offices to unify work arrangements and unify the use of forces, achieving good results in combating sabotage activities. The vast majority of county people's courts also dispatched circuit tribunals, going deep into rural areas and regions with more problems, to promptly handle a large number of cases that undermined the state's grain policy. Now we should continue to use and develop the existing experience to do this work better.

When carrying out this work, on the one hand, we must, in accordance with the state's policies and laws and in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and being conscientious and responsible, give all criminals the legal sanctions they deserve; on the other hand, we must also conduct propaganda and education among the masses, pay attention to investigating and refuting various rumors, stabilize people's minds, and prevent counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs from taking advantage of loopholes. This requires the people's public security organs and judicial organs to maintain closer ties with the masses, frequently pay attention to understanding the masses' ideological situation, clearly explain the principles from a positive perspective, and select some typical cases to handle in a high-profile manner, so as to explain the state's policies and laws to the masses, expose the crimes of the criminals, and make various reactionary rumors collapse by themselves.

    严惩纵火破坏粮食统购统销的罪犯
    大秋作物的收获季节已过，粮食计划收购工作正在进行，同时棉布的计划收购和计划供应和棉花的计划收购也已经开始。因而各地人民司法机关和公安机关都应该把保障计划收购和计划供应当作最近一个时期的中心任务，密切配合当地的财经贸易机关和合作社，及时发现和惩治一切敢于破坏计划收购和计划供应的犯罪分子。
    由于粮食及其他重要物资的统购统销，从几个重要方面截断了农村自发势力和城市资本主义的联系，对于少数的投机剥削者和反革命分子不利，因此他们必定要继续进行各种破坏活动。最近湖南省零陵县公安局破获的反动分子邓振忠纵火案，就是一个显著的例子。如果我们不及时采取措施，这种破坏活动就有可能更加猖獗。在去年国家实行粮食统购统销时，许多地方的人民公安机关、人民检察机关和人民法院曾经组织联合办公机构，统一布置工作和统一使用力量，在打击破坏活动上收到良好的效果。绝大多数的县人民法院还派出了巡回法庭，深入农村和问题较多的地区，及时处理了大批破坏国家粮食政策的案件。现在我们应该继续运用并且发扬已有的经验，把这一工作做得更好。
    在进行这一工作时，一方面要根据国家的政策法令，本着实事求是和认真负责的精神，给予一切犯罪分子以应得的法律制裁；另一方面还必须对群众进行宣传教育，注意追查和驳斥各种谣言，安定人心，使反革命分子和破坏分子无隙可乘。这就要求人民公安机关和司法机关更加密切地联系群众，经常注意了解群众的思想情况，从正面讲清道理，并且选择一些典型的案件，大张旗鼓地进行处理，借以向群众交代国家的政策法令，揭露犯罪分子的罪恶，使各种反动的谣言不攻自破。
