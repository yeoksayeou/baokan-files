Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th: According to TASS, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on November 2nd to consider the Soviet Union's request to include two new items on the agenda. These two items are: "Acts of Aggression against the People's of Republic of China and the Responsibility of the US Navy for These Acts" and "Violation of Freedom of Navigation in Chinese Waters." The General Committee had previously considered this issue, at which time the majority of the committee decided to postpone discussion of the matter.

British representative Dixon said that while he still considered the "accusation of acts of aggression" to be an item of the "Cold War," he did not intend to oppose its inclusion on the General Assembly's agenda this time.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky then spoke. He emphasized that the Soviet Union's submission of this issue to the General Assembly was in no way intended to exacerbate the "Cold War." He said that the issue was not the "Cold War," but the need to stop the illegal actions being carried out in the Chinese sea area, establish order and tranquility there, and prevent the recurrence of illegal acts of an aggressive nature, thereby helping to establish good-neighborly relations, peace and tranquility in that region.

He pointed out that there was no reason to associate this item with the "Cold War," which was being waged against the Soviet Union and other countries of the democratic camp, a "Cold War" that the Soviet Union had not participated in, did not participate in now, and would not participate in in the future. Discussing this issue would clarify the actual situation and undoubtedly help resolve outstanding issues and consolidate peace.

The General Committee, without objection, passed the inclusion of the above two items on the General Assembly agenda under the titles "Complaints Regarding Violation of Freedom of Navigation in Chinese Waters" and "Complaints Regarding Acts of Aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the US Navy for These Acts."

The General Committee also decided to submit these issues to the Political Committee for consideration. However, there was also an understanding that if the Political Committee's agenda became too crowded as a result, then these two items would be considered by the Special Political Committee.

    联合国大会总务委员会
    把美国侵略我国问题列入议程
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会十一月二日举行会议，考虑苏联提出的把两个新项目列入议程的要求。这两个项目是：“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”和“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”。总务委员会以前曾经考虑过这个问题，当时委员会的多数决定延迟对这个问题的讨论。
    英国代表狄克逊说，虽然他仍旧认为“对侵略行为的控诉”是“冷战”中的一个项目，但是这一次他不打算再反对把它列入大会议程。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基接着发言。他强调指出，苏联把这个问题提交大会，绝没有加剧“冷战”的意图。他说，问题不是“冷战”，而是有必要制止在中国海区域所进行的非法行动，并在那里确立秩序和安宁，杜绝重新发生具有侵略性质的非法行为的可能性，从而帮助建立那个区域的善邻关系以及和平和安宁。
    他指出，没有理由把这个项目同“冷战”联系起来，冷战是正在对苏联和民主阵营其他国家进行的，苏联过去和现在都没有参加、将来也不会参加这种冷战。讨论这个问题将能弄清楚实际情况，并且无疑将有助于解决悬而未决的问题和巩固和平。
    总务委员会在没有人反对的情况下，通过把上述两个项目以“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的控诉”和“关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任的控诉”为题列入大会议程。
    总务委员会并决定将这些问题提交政治委员会审议。但是同时有这样的谅解：如果政治委员会的议程因此变得过多，那末这两个项目将由特别政治委员会来审议。
