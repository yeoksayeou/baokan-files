    Actively Lead Workers to Strive to Improve Product Quality
    After National People's Congress deputies Wang Chonglun, Meng Tai, and Zhang Mingshan returned to their respective production units, they actively led the workers to strive to overfulfill production tasks and improve product quality.
    Workers in Wang Chonglun's tool workshop all proposed to actively produce, find more tricks, and better learn from Wang Chonglun. The workers hung a huge banner in the workshop stating that they would complete the fourth quarter production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. In October, they had overfulfilled the task by 15%. All the lathe operators in the workshop have also generally mastered the Kolesov tool method, which has a deep cutting depth and a large feed rate, which can double work efficiency.
    When the old hero Meng Tai returned to the iron smelting plant, he was greeted by a series of new production achievements. In the third quarter, the entire plant saved the country more than 3 billion yuan in wealth by reducing scrap iron and Tangma iron. After Meng Tai returned to the factory to participate in production, the enthusiasm of the workers was even higher. On the daily production record sheet, most of the entries were good news, written in red ink, about completing or overfulfilling tasks. On the 23rd, No. 7 blast furnace created a new record since its start-up, with a daily output exceeding the national plan by 20.8%, and the quality was all Grade 1 steel. No. 6 blast furnace, which started producing iron on October 1, completed the October national plan three days and twenty-three hours ahead of schedule and produced more than 3,000 tons of iron for the country.
    After Zhang Mingshan returned to the small rolling mill, he led the workers to strive to improve the quality of steel. Many workers regarded improving the quality of steel as their top priority. Rolling worker Song Xiujia said: "Every defective product we produce will cause a loss to the country." In the past, his group B often produced eight, nine, or even a dozen defective products every day, but now it usually only produces one or two, and sometimes it can go for several shifts without producing any defective products.

### 全国人民代表大会代表王崇伦、孟泰、张明山  积极带动广大职工努力提高产品质量

    全国人民代表大会代表王崇伦、孟泰、张明山
    积极带动广大职工努力提高产品质量
    全国人民代表大会代表王崇伦、孟泰、张明山等回到自己所在的生产单位后，积极带动职工们为超额完成生产任务、提高产品质量而努力。
    王崇伦所在的工具车间的工人，都提出要积极生产、多找窍门，更好地向王崇伦学习。工人们在车间里挂上了提前十五天完成第四季度生产计划的巨幅标语。十月份，他们已超额百分之十五完成了任务。全车间的车工还普遍掌握了科列索夫车刀法，这种车刀法的吃刀量深、送刀量大，能提高工作效率两倍。
    老英雄孟泰一回到炼铁厂，迎接他的是一连串新的生产成就。第三季度内，全厂在减少残铁和唐麻铁方面，为国家节约了三十多亿元的财富。当孟泰回厂参加了生产后，职工们生产的热情更高了，每日生产纪录表上，绝大部分都是用红笔记的完成或超额完成任务的好消息。七号高炉二十三日创造了开工以来的新纪录，日产量超过国家计划百分之二十点八，质量全部为一级制钢铁。十月一日开始出铁的六号高炉，已提前三天零二十三小时完成了十月份国家计划，并为国家多生产了三千多吨铁。
    张明山回到小型轧钢厂后，带动职工为提高钢材质量而努力。许多职工都把提高钢材质量当成了自己头等的任务。压延工人宋秀家说：“我们多出一根废品，就要给国家造成一分损失。”他所在的乙班，过去往往每天要出八、九根甚至十几根废品，现在一般只有一、二根，有时做到一连几班不出废品。　（新华社）
