Soviet Experts Educate Us
Qian Shangzhong, Engineer of the Drilling Team, No. 241 Exploration Team, Geological Department
Li Yuying, Deputy Chief of the Geology Section

Soviet experts have come to Team 241 six times now. Each time they come, they raise our work a step and provide a profound education for all employees.

The geological exploration undertaking of New China is still very young. Most of our team members had never seen a drilling rig before, nor could they recognize ore. We few veteran geological explorers, during the Kuomintang rule, were at most just running around in the field, finding a few stones and writing articles, never conducting detailed exploration of mining areas. Without the help of Soviet experts, it would be simply unimaginable when our exploration work would achieve any results.

Soviet experts' help is meticulous, from exploration design to exploration, to sampling and testing, to writing reports, they all provide detailed opinions. They even think very thoroughly about what a geological record book should look like. We remember most clearly the time on August 27th, when due to the carelessness of a comrade in the motorcade, a car caught fire. The fire was very big at the time, and when Comrade Zafalin saw it, he ran to the fire and shouted, "Quick, quick, quick! Quickly bring all the water trucks to put out the fire!" The fire was quickly extinguished, and Comrade Zafalin kept stamping his feet, feeling very remorseful. He said, "I visited your car room, but I forgot to make fire prevention suggestions, which is really a pity!"

Soviet experts taught us to cherish national property. "Make correct reports in the shortest possible time and with the least amount of money," "Use trench exploration if possible instead of well exploration, and use well exploration if possible instead of tunnel exploration." Last winter, we only cared about making it easier for ourselves to move around inside, and dug the exploration wells and trenches very wide and large. Comrade Chebotarev said, "Doing so is wasteful. The state gives you the task, which means it trusts you. The state gives you money to spend, you should save every penny!"

In the past, in our geological circles, the ideology of "going it alone" was very serious. Geologists didn't care about drilling, and iron miners didn't mine copper. Comrade Korotky taught us: "Geological exploration is a comprehensive work, and everyone should understand and cooperate with each other. Although your task is to explore iron ore, if you find other useful things during the exploration, you should also study them at the same time, otherwise you are being irresponsible to the people!"

Soviet experts also taught us: "People are the most valuable asset," and we must always care about the safety of workers and the lives of workers. As soon as Comrade Droppet arrived, he wanted to visit everywhere to understand the workers' situation in all aspects. He cared about the workers' rest, saying, "Without good rest, there is no good work." When he heard that we only ate two meals a day, he immediately asked us to change to three meals a day. He said, "Eating two meals a day easily causes stomach problems." He ran to the drilling rig room and saw that the ladder was upright, and it was very inconvenient for workers to go up and down, and immediately said, "This ladder is prepared for monkeys." He saw that the flywheel of the diesel engine was not covered, and euphemistically suggested, "If the leaders pay attention to safety issues, the workers do not have to worry about their own safety during production, which is also of great benefit to production."

In the past two years, a total of sixteen Soviet experts have come here, and each expert has left us with hundreds of suggestions before leaving. Our team has printed these suggestions into thick volumes of lectures, which serve as textbooks for all employees. The precious spirit of these suggestions will always be remembered in our hearts and become a force to spur us forward.

### 苏联专家给我们的教育

    苏联专家给我们的教育
    地质部二四一勘探队钻队工程师  钱尚忠
                    地质科副科长  李毓英
    苏联专家到二四一队来，前前后后已经有六次了。来一次就使我们的工作提高一步，给全体职工一次深刻的教育。
    新中国的地质勘探事业还很年轻。我们队里绝大部分同志原先没见过钻机，认不得矿石。我们几个老地质勘探者，在国民党统治时期，顶多不过是跑跑野外，找几块石头写写文章，从来没有对矿区进行过详细勘探。要是没有苏联专家的帮助，简直不能设想我们的勘探工作要到什么时候才能取得一点成绩。
    苏联专家对我们的帮助是无微不至的，从勘探设计到勘探、到采样化验、到编写，都提出详细的意见。连地质记录本应是个什么样子，他们都想得周周到到。我们记得最清楚的一次是在八月二十七日，由于汽车队一位同志的疏忽大意，把一辆汽车烧着了，当时火势很大，札伐陵同志看见了，就跑到火场，大喊：“快快快！快把所有的水车开来救火！”火很快地被扑灭了，札伐陵同志还连连顿足，懊恼不已。他说：“我参观了你们的汽车房，可是我竟忘了提出防火的建议，真是遗憾！”
    苏联专家教育我们要十分爱护国家财产。“要用极短的时间、极少的钱做出正确的报告”，“能用槽探解决的就不要用井探，能用井探解决的就不要用洞探。”去年冬天，我们只顾自己在里面活动起来方便，把探井、探槽挖得很宽很大。切伯乔夫同志说：“这样做是浪费的，国家把任务交给你们，就是表示对你们的信任。国家把钱交给你们花，你们应该节省一个算一个！”
    以前，在我们地质界，“单干”思想十分严重，搞地质的不管钻探，采铁的不采铜。柯罗特基同志就教导我们：“地质勘探是一个综合性的工作，都要互相了解，互相配合。你们的任务虽然是勘探铁矿，可是，在勘探的时候，如果发现其他有用的东西，也要同时进行研究，否则就是对人民不负责任！”
    苏联专家还教导我们：“人是最宝贵的财富”，必须时刻关心工人的安全、工人的生活。德罗裴特同志一来，就要到处参观，了解工人各方面情况。他关心工人的休息，他说：“没有很好的休息就没有很好的工作。”他听说我们每天吃两顿饭，马上就要我们改成吃三顿。他说：“吃两顿容易害胃病。”他跑到钻机房，看见梯子是直立的，工人上下很不方便，马上就说：“这梯子是给猴子预备的。”他看见柴油机的飞轮没安罩子，就委婉地提出：“领导上如果注意保安问题，工人在生产时不必顾虑自己的安全问题，对生产也有很大的好处。”
    两年来，我们这儿一共来过十六位苏联专家，每位专家临走时都给我们留下了几百条建议。我队已把这些建议印成一厚本一厚本的讲义，作为全体职工的学习课本。这些建议的宝贵精神，永远记在我们心里，成为鞭策我们不断前进的力量。
