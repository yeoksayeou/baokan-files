The Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain part of Northeast China shot down a US C-47 aircraft on the night of November 29, 1952, which had deliberately unmarked its craft and intruded into Jilin Province, Northeast China. The incident killed the pilots Norm Schwartz and Bob Snoddy and captured two US citizens, John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau. The People's Public Security Organs and Public Security Forces in Northeast China subsequently captured nine Chinese American special agents, including Zhang Zaiwen, who had been airdropped into Northeast China by Downey et al., and killed Man Zhihui and Wang Huadong. All evidence was seized during the capture and annihilation. After interrogation by the Northeast Public Security Organs, these defendants, along with the evidence, were transferred to this Procuratorate. After examination by the military procurators of this Procuratorate, it was confirmed that John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau were spies of the American Central Intelligence Agency, an American spy agency.

He was a spy of the American Central Intelligence Agency stationed in Japan, airdropped into Northeast China.
The criminal facts of the defendants listed on the right are as follows:
    I. Defendants John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau, on the night of November 29, 1952, flew a C-47 aircraft with deliberately unmarked craft to sneak into Jilin Province, China, to contact and support special agents who had been airdropped into Northeast China, and planned to take away special agent Li Junying, who had been airdropped, to report the situation in order to continue airdropping a large number of special agents into mainland China. The aircraft was discovered and shot down by the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain part of Northeast China. The perpetrators were captured, and evidence such as pistols, telecommunications equipment, maps, parachutes, and equipment for taking special agents were seized.
    Defendant John Thomas Downey not only came to China to airdrop special agents, but also took on the task of training and dispatching special agents to China. In the spring of 1952, Downey, together with another American spy, under the instructions of the person in charge of the Atsugi spy agency of the American Central Intelligence Agency stationed in Japan, selected eight special agents—Li Junying, Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Man Zhihui, Luan Hengshan, Wang Jinsheng, and Wang Donghua—from the Saipan Island spy training institution of the American Central Intelligence Agency. He brought them to a secret training camp set up in Chigasaki City, Japan, where Downey was responsible for conducting airdrop training. In addition, Wang Weifan and radio operators Niu Songlin and Zhong Dianxin were transferred from other spy technology training institutions of the American Central Intelligence Agency. Then, Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Man Zhihui, and Niu Songlin were organized into the "Wen Team," and in July 1952, they were secretly airdropped into Jilin Province, Northeast China, by a C-47 American aircraft. Luan Hengshan, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Wang Donghua, and Zhong Dianxin were organized into the "Shen Team," and in September of the same year, they were dropped into Liaoning Province, Northeast China, by a B-47 American aircraft. In October of the same year, Li Junying was dropped into Jilin Province. In August 1952, the defendant personally flew an American aircraft to sneak into Jilin Province, Northeast China, to airdrop food and supplies to the "Wen Team" airdropped in Jilin Province.
    II. Defendants Zhang Zaiwen and others were originally Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers who participated in the anti-people civil war. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army was defeated, they fled to Hong Kong and were recruited by the American spy organization "Free China Movement" in Hong Kong. Under the guise of being hired by the "Far East Reclamation Company" to work in Guam, the defendants were sent in batches by plane to the American Central Intelligence Agency spy training institutions in Chigasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, and Saipan Island, where they received secret training. The training content mainly included espionage techniques such as assassination, demolition, armed riots, intelligence gathering, and secret communication against China. They were then selected by Downey and sent to the Chigasaki secret training camp for airdrop training, and then issued radios, weapons, etc. They were organized into the "Wen Team" and "Shen Team" respectively, and secretly airdropped into the Laoling mountainous area of Antu County, Jilin Province, and the mountainous area near Longwan, Jingyu County, Jilin Province, in July and September 1952. Defendant Li Junying was airdropped into the Laoling mountainous area of Antu County, Jilin Province, in October of the same year. The defendants were successively captured by the Northeast Public Security Organs and the Public Security Forces of the People's Liberation Army, and various weapons, ammunition, radios, maps, parachutes, forged passports of the People's Liberation Army, disability certificates, passes, and other documents, as well as various tools and a large amount of evidence such as gold and banknotes used for their espionage activities, were seized.
    The tasks assigned to defendants Zhang Zaiwen and others by the American spy agency were to establish an armed spy "base" in Northeast China, hide spy "safe houses," "airdrop sites," and a secret communication line from the "base" to Shenyang; collect information on China's defense facilities, industrial area targets, and meteorological intelligence; rescue intruding American air force personnel who had been shot down; and recruit remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitor group to carry out armed riots. Defendant Li Junying's task was to inspect the activities of the "Wen Team" after landing. Defendants Zhang Zaiwen and others also confessed that the conspiracy aim of the American spy agency in training them and sending them to mainland China to carry out activities was to "coordinate the United States in launching World War III."
    Based on the above facts, it is fully proven that defendants Downey and Fecteau, in order to realize the conspiracy of the American aggressors to expand armed aggression against China and sabotage the people's democratic cause in China, actively recruited, trained, and dispatched special agents to China to carry out sabotage activities, and personally used aircraft to sneak into China to directly carry out espionage activities, seriously endangering China's national security. Defendants Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, Niu Songlin, Luan Hengshan, Wang Weifan, Wang Jinsheng, Zhong Dianxin, and Li Junying colluded with imperialism, betrayed the motherland, and acted as American spies, sabotaging the people's democratic cause of the motherland, which is indeed a serious crime. All defendants in this case have confessed to the above-mentioned crimes due to conclusive evidence. A public prosecution is hereby filed against the eleven defendants, John Thomas Downey et al., requesting that they be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries."
