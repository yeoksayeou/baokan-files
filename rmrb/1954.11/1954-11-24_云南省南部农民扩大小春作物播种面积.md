Farmers of various ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and Simao Special District in Yunnan Province are changing their past habits and expanding the planting area of spring crops.

The Dai farmers in eighty-four villages in Banna Jinghong, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, planted more than 50,000 jin of spring crop seeds. At present, more than 2,900 jin of broad beans and peanuts have been sown in six villages, including Mangnan. In the Menglian Dai, Lahu and Va Autonomous Region, only three villages planted wheat last year, but this year there are eight villages. The county alone has planted more than 4,800 jin of wheat and pea seeds, an increase of three times over last year. The spring sowing area of ​​the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region and the Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous Region has also increased compared with the past. In the six counties of Puer, Mojiang, Jingdong, Simao, Jinggu, and Zhenyuan in Simao Special District, which have already undergone land reform, spring sowing is coming to an end under the drive of mutual assistance and cooperation. The spring sowing area in Jingdong County this year has expanded by more than 43,000 mu compared with last year, and the county alone has planted more than 6,800 mu of rapeseed.

In the process of sowing spring crops, farmers of all ethnic groups have received strong support from the state. The state has lent more than 16,000 jin of spring crop seeds to Banna Jinghong, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region alone. (Our Yunnan Reporter Station)

    云南省南部农民扩大小春作物播种面积
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区和思茅专区的各族农民改变过去的习惯，扩大了小春作物的种植面积。
    西双版纳傣族自治区版纳景洪八十四个寨子的傣族农民，种了小春作物种籽五万多斤。目前芒南等六个寨子下种的蚕豆、花生已有二千九百多斤。孟连县傣族拉祜族佧佤族自治区，去年种小麦的只三个村，今年已有八个村，全县仅麦子、豌豆就种了四千八百多斤种籽，比去年增加了三倍。澜沧拉祜族自治区、江城县哈尼族彝族自治区的小春播种面积也都比过去增加。思茅专区已经土改的普洱、墨江、景东、思茅、景谷、镇沅六个县，在互助合作的带动下，小春播种已快要结束。景东县今年小春播种面积比去年扩大了四万三千多亩，全县仅油菜就种了六千八百多亩。
    在播种小春作物中，各族农民都得到了国家的大力支持，国家仅贷给西双版纳傣族自治区版纳景洪的小春作物种籽就有一万六千多斤。 （本报云南记者站）
