Xinhua News Agency, 18th. According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on the 16th, the Afghan Ambassador to India, Aziz, denied on the 16th that the Afghan government had proposed a "joint defense plan" with Pakistan.

Pakistani Interior Minister Mirza said a few days ago that the suggestion for Afghanistan and Pakistan to conclude a joint defense plan was first proposed by Afghan Foreign Minister Naim during his visit to Karachi last week. Aziz pointed out that these words were "groundless."

Aziz said that the news about the recent visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister published in Pakistani newspapers was "written under instruction." "I can say that Pakistani newspapers and its Interior Minister are trying to confuse the issue."

    阿富汗驻印度大使阿齐兹
    否认阿富汗建议同巴基斯坦订立军事条约
    【新华社十八日讯】据印度报业托辣斯十六日报道，阿富汗驻印度大使阿齐兹十六日否认阿富汗政府曾建议和巴基斯坦订立一项“联合防御计划”。
    巴基斯坦内政部部长米尔扎前几天曾说，阿富汗和巴基斯坦订立联合防御计划的建议是由阿富汗外交大臣纳伊姆在上星期访问喀喇蚩期间首先提出的。阿齐兹指出，这些话是“毫无根据的”。
    阿齐兹说，巴基斯坦报纸上登载的有关阿富汗外交大臣最近的访问的消息是“受指示而写的”。“我可以说，巴基斯坦的报纸和它的内政部部长是设法使问题混乱起来。”
