Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 23rd: According to TASS, Washington: French Prime Minister Mendès France arrived in Washington on the 17th and held talks with U.S. President Eisenhower and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles from the 17th to the 20th. A communiqué was issued at the conclusion of the talks. The communiqué is a vague declaration, providing no specific details about the results of the talks.

The communiqué expressed the joint desire for the “early ratification of the Paris Agreements.” The communiqué noted that Mendès France "looks forward with hope to the prospect of increasingly effective relations between France and Germany... The United States also attaches great importance to this." The communiqué stated that the U.S. Secretary of State gave "serious consideration" to the situation in North Africa.

It can be seen from the communiqué that the Indochina issue was also discussed during the talks. The communiqué "reaffirmed" the "understanding" reached in September on the issues of Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. It is known that the agreement reached between the U.S. and France in September on Indochina stipulates that the United States will provide direct military assistance to the Indochinese countries. World opinion considers this a conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference decisions.

The French Prime Minister's talks in Washington were conducted in secret, and no formal communiqué was issued regarding the content of the talks. However, it can be seen from the materials published in American newspapers that Mendès France went to the United States to discuss a wide range of political, military, and economic issues.

It can also be seen from newspaper reports that on several issues during the talks, Mendès France essentially surrendered to Washington. At the same time, serious differences between the U.S. and France were exposed on other issues.

The Associated Press correspondent in Washington reported: "Well-informed diplomatic sources say that on several issues, Mendès France largely agreed with the American views."

The "New York Times" wrote: "The French Prime Minister's firm support for the London Agreements and the Paris Agreements, and his unwillingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union at least until the agreements have been ratified, has greatly satisfied American officials."

The issue of mutual relations with West Germany was one aspect of the Washington negotiations, as the Paris Agreements make it very likely that West Germany will exert economic and military pressure on France. It is reported that Mendès France obtained assurances from Dulles on the Saar agreement. However, according to the Associated Press correspondent in Washington, "Dulles intends to reject France's request: that the United States guarantee the Franco-German agreement on the Saar in its current form."

Clearly, American diplomats intend to use the Saar issue as a means of exerting pressure on the French government.

As for the Indochina issue, the talks between Mendès France and U.S. government figures once again prove that the United States is increasingly interfering in the internal affairs of the Indochinese countries. The "New York Times" correspondent in Washington wrote: "U.S. officials pointed out that the United States wants to know France's intentions clearly before it can offer guarantees of support for any specific plan." The reporter continued: "Influential American figures declined to comment on Collins' statement." This special representative of the U.S. President in South Vietnam stated that the United States has full responsibility for training the South Vietnamese army.

According to the Associated Press correspondent in Washington, the issues of U.S. financial assistance to the French army in South Vietnam and the functions of the U.S. military advisory group will be resolved in future talks. For now, Dulles and Mendès France have only reached an agreement on supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem government. According to the reporter, this is a "limited concession by Mendès France."

United Press International reported that Dulles made it clear to Mendès France that the United States retains "final decision-making power" regarding the manner in which American weapons are "transferred to...European allies" under the U.S. military aid program. According to UPI reporter Gonzalez, Dulles also pressed Mendès France closely on how American weapons would be used in North Africa.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 23rd: Parisian newspapers have been commenting on the Franco-American talks.

"L'Humanité" wrote: "Mendès France has proven himself to be aligning with American policy. The final communiqué of the Washington talks aims to conceal the fact that Mendès France had to stand on the same side as the United States on all issues—whether it was the Saar issue, the Indochina issue, or the North Africa issue." "L'Humanité" also pointed out that Mendès France went to the United States to "make absolute assurances: that the London and Paris Agreements would be ratified, and that he would reject the Soviet Union's proposals."

"Libération" pointed out that while Mendès France had in fact surrendered to American demands, the U.S. government "politely refused" to satisfy any of the French Prime Minister's requests. The newspaper continued: "Mendès France did not get the dollars he asked for. Not only that, but he also promised Dulles that France would not reduce the expenses it should give to the North Atlantic Group in 1955."

The newspapers also pointed out the existing differences between France and the United States.

"Le Monde" emphasized that the United States is attempting to use the North African national liberation movement to achieve its own goals, forcing France to leave the North African region. The leaders in Washington are conducting a "conspiracy in North Africa that is purely dominated by American strategic, economic, and other considerations." The newspaper also wrote that the Indochina issue caused even sharper divisions between the two countries because the American attempt to exclude France from South Vietnam is even more blatant. Parisian newspapers reported that the United States demanded that Mendès France support the American puppet, Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, in South Vietnam.

Right-wing newspapers did not conceal their disappointment with the results of Mendès France's talks in Washington. "Combat" believed that the communiqué of the talks was "rather disappointing" because it was very vague.

### 法美在华盛顿的会谈结束并发表公报  法国舆论指出法总理对美国的要求投降

    法美在华盛顿的会谈结束并发表公报
    法国舆论指出法总理对美国的要求投降
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯十七日抵达华盛顿后，从十七日到二十日同美国总统艾森豪威尔以及美国国务卿杜勒斯举行会谈，会谈结束时发表了公报。公报是一篇空泛的宣言，对于会谈的结果，没有丝毫具体的说明。
    公报表示：会谈双方关切地希望“及早批准巴黎协定”。公报指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯“满怀希望地瞻望法德两国建立成效日著的关系的前景……对于这一点，美国也是十分重视的”。公报说，美国国务卿对于北非局势问题予以“认真的考虑”。
    从公报中可以看出，会谈中还讨论了印度支那问题。公报指出，双方“重申”了九月在柬埔寨、老挝和南越问题上达到的“谅解”。大家知道，美法两国九月就印度支那问题达成的协议规定美国给予印度支那国家以直接的军事援助。世界舆论认为这是破坏日内瓦会议决定的阴谋。
    法国总理在华盛顿的会谈是秘密进行的，关于会谈的内容，未曾发表过任何正式公报。但是，从美国报纸所发表的材料中可以看出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯到美国去是要广泛讨论政治、军事、经济方面的问题。
    从报纸消息中还可以看出，在会谈的几个问题上，孟戴斯—弗朗斯实质上向华盛顿投降了。同时在另外一些问题上，暴露了美法之间的严重分歧。
    美联社驻华盛顿记者报道说：“消息灵通的外交人士说，在若干问题上，孟戴斯—弗朗斯在很大程度上同意美国的意见。”
      “纽约时报”写道：“法国总理对伦敦协定和巴黎协定作的坚定支持以及他至少在协定没有批准以前不愿意和苏联进行谈判的做法，使美国的官方人物十分满意。”
      和西德的相互关系问题是华盛顿谈判的一个方面，因为巴黎协定使西德极有可能对法国施加经济上和军事上的压力。据报道：孟戴斯—弗朗斯在萨尔协定上从杜勒斯那里取得了保证。可是，据美联社驻华盛顿记者说，“杜勒斯打算拒绝法国的要求：要美国保障目前形式的法德关于萨尔的协定。”
    显然，美国的外交人士打算把萨尔问题当作对法国政府施压力的手段。
    至于印度支那问题，孟戴斯—弗朗斯和美国政府人物的会谈再一次证明，美国是一步紧似一步地干涉印度支那国家的内政。“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者写道：“美国官方人物指出，美国想先明确地知道法国的打算，而后才能提出支持某种具体计划的保证。”记者接着说：“美国有势力的人物拒绝评论柯林斯的声明。”这个美国总统在南越的特派代表在声明中说，美国对训练南越军队负有完全责任。
    据美联社驻华盛顿记者报道，关于美国对南越的法军给以财政上援助以及关于美国军事顾问团的职能问题，要留待以后会谈来解决。现在杜勒斯和孟戴斯—弗朗斯不过在支持吴庭艳政府问题上取得了协议，据记者说，这是“孟戴斯—弗朗斯的有限的让步”。
    合众社报道说，杜勒斯向孟戴斯—弗朗斯明白地说：关于以什么方式把美国武器根据美国军事援助计划“移交给……欧洲盟国”的问题，美国保有
  “最后决定权”。据合众社记者冈萨雷斯写道：杜勒斯还紧紧地追问孟戴斯—弗朗斯：如何在北非利用美国的武器。
      【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：巴黎报纸纷纷评论法美会谈。
      “人道报”写道：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯证明自己是在向美国政策看齐。华盛顿会谈的最后公报目的是在掩饰这样一个事实：孟戴斯—弗朗斯在所有问题上——无论是在萨尔问题、印度支那问题或是北非问题上——都不得不和美国站在同一立场。”“人道报”还指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯到美国去是为了“作出绝对的保证：伦敦和巴黎协定将被批准，他会拒绝苏联的建议”。
    “解放报”指出，当孟戴斯—弗朗斯在事实上已对美国的要求投降的时候，美国政府却“彬彬有礼地拒绝”满足法国总理的任何要求。这家报纸继续写道：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯没有得到他所要求的美元。不但如此，他还答应杜勒斯：法国将不会缩减一九五五年应交给北大西洋集团的费用。”
    各报同时指出了法美之间存在着的分歧。
    “新闻报”强调指出：美国企图利用北非民族解放运动来达到它自己的目的，迫使法国离开北非地区。华盛顿的领袖们正在北非进行一种“纯粹受美国战略、经济和其他方面考虑所支配的阴谋”。这家报纸还写道：印度支那问题引起了两国更加尖锐的分歧，因为美国要把法国排出南越的企图是更加露骨的。巴黎报纸报道：美国要求孟戴斯—弗朗斯支持美国在南越的傀儡吴庭艳总理。
    右翼报纸没有掩饰它们对孟戴斯—弗朗斯在华盛顿会谈的结果感到的失望。“战斗报”认为，会谈公报是“相当使人失望的”，因为它是十分含糊其辞的。
