Shenyang People's Supervision Correspondents Actively Play a Supervisory Role

    Shenyang City's People's Supervision Correspondents have actively played a supervisory role and achieved certain results. The People's Supervision Correspondents of the Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China reflected a total of 51 issues in the third quarter, an increase of 70% compared to the second quarter. They exposed the problem of 48 billion yuan of accumulated funds in the former Northeast Trade Department, accelerating the turnover of funds. The People's Supervision Correspondents of the Small Hardware Store of Shenyang Hardware and Machinery Company discovered that 27 train cars of precision screws were placed in the open air and promptly reported to the higher authorities, avoiding losses. The People's Supervision Correspondents of the state-owned commercial sector exposed the chaotic situation in state-owned commerce, where retail sales were disconnected from wholesale and warehouse work, leading to warehouse backlogs and out-of-stock situations in stores. The People's Supervision Correspondent Group of the 218 Construction Site of the Second Engineering Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau suggested adding iron sheets to the wooden roof model boards, which increased their usage value and saved the state more than 160 million yuan.
