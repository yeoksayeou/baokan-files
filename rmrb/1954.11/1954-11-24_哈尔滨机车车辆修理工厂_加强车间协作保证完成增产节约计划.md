    Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory
    Strengthens Workshop Cooperation to Guarantee Completion of Production Increase and Economization Plan
    The Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory has strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation between workshops and groups to ensure the completion of production plans and plans for increasing production and practicing economy.
    Originally, the factory's processing capacity for new wheel production was insufficient, often affecting the overall completion of the production plan. The factory leadership decided to transfer many of the processing tasks for new wheels, which were originally the responsibility of the rolling stock workshop, to the Li Shuzeng large turning group in the mechanical workshop. The workers of the Li Shuzeng group, recognizing the importance of this work, put forward many suggestions for improving tools and operating methods to increase work efficiency. Turner Zhou Yulin proposed using two tools to process simultaneously, which could increase efficiency by more than double. Turner Meng Qinghui, based on Zhou Yulin's suggestion, made a double tool holder. He originally needed two and a half hours to cut a wheel core, but now it only takes one hour. Li Shuzeng and other turners also improved the cutting tools, thus smoothly solving the wheel processing problem. The factory's boiler workshop also had a long-standing problem of low quality and frequent rework of locomotive boilers, because the electric connecting machine caused the top to bulge and the bottom to concavity when welding smoke tubes. Failure to solve this problem would affect the completion of the production increase and economization plan. Therefore, the electrical workshop mobilized advanced producers among the electrical coil workers and electrical fitters in the entire workshop to jointly form a research group to help solve this problem. In addition, the factory also mobilized advanced producers to solve some key technical operation problems.

    加强车间协作保证完成增产节约计划
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂加强车间、小组的互助协作，保证完成生产计划和增产节约计划。
    这个工厂原来新造车轮的加工力量不够，常常影响生产计划的全面完成。厂的领导方面就决定把原来应由车辆车间担负的许多对新造车轮的加工任务，交给机械车间李树增大镟小组去完成。李树增小组的工人们认识到这个工作的重要性，便提出许多改进工具和操作法的建议，来提高工作效率。镟工周玉林提出用两把刀同时加工的办法，可使效率提高一倍多。镟工孟庆会根据周玉林的意见做了一台双刀刀架，他原来要用两个半小时切一个轮心，现在缩短到一个小时就行了。李树增并和其他镟工一起改进了刃具，这样就顺利解决了车轮加工的问题。这个厂的锅炉车间也长久存在着机车锅炉质量低、返工多的问题，原因是电力接管机在熔接烟管时，上鼓下凹。这个问题不解决就会影响增产节约计划的完成。于是电动车间就发动全车间的电器线圈工、电器钳工中的先进生产者，共同组成一个研究小组，帮助解决了这个问题。另外，厂里还发动先进生产者解决了一些技术操作方面的关键问题。
