    State-owned machinery manufacturing plants in Northeast China carry out production collaboration
    To produce complete sets of equipment for many key projects
    The First Ministry of Machine Building has organized production collaboration among the machinery manufacturing plants in Northeast China to produce complete sets of equipment for many key projects. Before the first quarter of this year, these factories could only collaborate on the production of general parts and semi-finished products. Now, they can collaborate on the production of complete sets of equipment. In the complete set of equipment for the renovation of the third automated blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel, except for some extremely precise automatic control instruments, more than 90 percent of the equipment was produced through mutual collaboration among the factories based on their production characteristics. Dalian Engineering & Mining Vehicle Factory manufactured the weighing car, molten iron ladle car, and slag pot car required for the blast furnace. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant made the molten iron ladle for the molten iron ladle car and the slag pot for the slag pot car. Shenyang Low-Voltage Switchgear Factory also produced electrical control equipment for various cars. The 10,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generating equipment required for the Guanting Reservoir was manufactured in succession through mutual collaboration by many factories in Harbin and Shenyang. The quality of the equipment produced through collaboration by these factories can meet standards.
    The First Ministry of Machine Building's factories in Northeast China have also carried out production collaboration with more than a dozen local state-owned factories. Shenyang High-Voltage Switchgear Factory undertook the production of a large number of electrical control equipment for key projects and was temporarily overwhelmed. It handed over the production of DC distribution panels to the local state-owned Shenyang Electrical Appliance Factory. In this way, it not only met the needs of national construction but also solved the problem of insufficient production tasks for some local state-owned factories. At the same time, because the products are manufactured according to Soviet blueprints, the technical level of local state-owned factories can also be improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北各国营机械制造厂进行生产协作
    为许多重点工程配制了成套的设备
    第一机械工业部在东北的各个机械制造厂进行生产协作，为许多重点工程配制了成套的设备。今年第一季度以前，这些工厂还只能在生产一般部件、半成品时进行协作，现在已能协作配制整套设备了。鞍钢改建第三座自动化高炉的整套设备中，除了部分极精密的自动控制计器外，有百分之九十以上的设备都是各厂根据本厂生产的特点互相协作配成的。大连工矿车辆厂制造了高炉上必需的称量车、铁水车和渣罐车；沈阳重型机器厂给铁水车上做了铁水包，给渣罐车上做了渣罐；沈阳低压开关厂又配制了各种车上的电器控制设备。官厅水库需要的一万瓩水力发电设备，全部是由哈尔滨和沈阳的许多工厂互相协作陆续制造出来的。这些工厂协作生产的设备，质量都能达到标准。
    第一机械工业部在东北的各厂还和当地十几个地方国营工厂进行了生产协作。沈阳高压开关厂承制重点工程的电器控制设备较多，一时忙不过来，就把直流配电盘交给地方国营沈阳电器制造厂做。这样，既能赶上国家建设的需要，也解决了某些地方国营工厂部分生产任务不足的问题，同时，由于产品是根据苏联图纸制造的，地方国营工厂的技术水平还可以提高。　　　（新华社）
