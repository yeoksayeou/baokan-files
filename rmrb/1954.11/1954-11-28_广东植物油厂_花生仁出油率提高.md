    Guangdong Vegetable Oil Factory

    Improved Peanut Kernel Oil Yield

    The local state-owned Guangdong Vegetable Oil Factory, starting from November 3rd, achieved an average oil yield of 44.359 jin per 100 jin of peanut kernels, which is 3.892 jin more than the average daily oil yield in May, when the oil yield was at its highest. Based on this oil yield, it is estimated that an additional 76,750 jin of peanut oil can be extracted by the end of the year.

    This factory, in August, combined a major overhaul of its machinery with a summary of experiences in appropriately slowing down machine speed and extending pressing time to improve oil yield. In mid-October, all the factory workers responded to the call for increased production and economy issued by the higher-level leading organs, and their production enthusiasm was very high. Since resuming production, they have strictly observed operating procedures, thus significantly increasing the oil yield. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东植物油厂
    花生仁出油率提高
    地方国营广东植物油厂从十一月三日起，每百斤花生仁平均出油四十四点三五九斤，比出油率最高的五月份平均每日出油数量还多三点八九二斤。按这个出油率计算：到年底为止，可以多榨出七万六千七百五十斤花生油。
    这个厂在今年八月曾结合机器大检修，总结了适当减慢机器运转速度、延长压榨时间以提高出油率的经验。十月中旬，全厂职工又响应了上级领导机关提出的增产节约的号召，生产情绪很高。他们复工生产以后，严格地遵守操作规程，因而使出油率显著提高。　（新华社）
