The autumn agricultural tax collection and autumn grain unified purchase work in Shandong Province has now fully commenced, and some areas have already begun to deliver grain to warehouses.

Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels in Shandong, a series of cadre meetings were held to specifically explain the policies and methods of autumn grain purchase on the basis of further raising the socialist consciousness of cadres. When cadres went deep into the masses to conduct propaganda, they used methods such as organizing recollection and comparison, and carefully calculating accounts to specifically explain the significance of enthusiastically paying agricultural tax in grain and selling surplus grain. Now, under the slogan of "Supporting the country's socialist industrialization, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting the people in disaster areas," the broad masses of peasants are actively paying agricultural tax in grain and selling surplus grain. Peasants in Maozhuang, First District, Ningyang County, paid all 168,000 jin of their public grain in full within two days, October 21st and 22nd; by October 26th, they had sold more than 180,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The grain sent to the state granary by peasants in Fuli Township, First District, Boxing County, now totals more than 669,000 jin. Before sending the grain to the warehouse, the township widely launched a grain-drying campaign. Peasant Wang Guanmei said: "It is an honor for peasants to sell good grain to the country. Our grain must be thoroughly dried and winnowed to prevent the country from suffering losses." The day before the grain was sent, they winnowed the already dried grain with a dustpan and dried it for another day.

At present, the amount of grain purchased and collected into warehouses in various places is constantly increasing. According to statistics from the four special districts of Tai'an, Jining, Linyi, and Jiaozhou, the amount of grain purchased by the end of October increased by more than two times compared with September.

This year's oil crops in Hebei Province have had a bumper harvest, and peasants in various regions are promptly and enthusiastically selling various oil crops to the state. By the end of October, according to statistics from Zhangjiakou Special District counties and Tong County alone, more than 61.3 million jin of oil crops such as peanuts, flax seeds, and rapeseed had been purchased. Among them, Zhangbei County has completed 75 percent of its fourth-quarter oil crop purchase plan; the total amount of peanuts purchased in Tong County in October increased more than four times compared with the same period last year.

Recently, the amount of oil crops coming onto the market in various places has continued to increase. The daily amount of peanuts coming onto the market in Shulu County has increased from 8,000 jin to 90,000 jin; the daily amount of oil crops purchased in Shangdu County has risen from 250,000 jin in early October to 570,000 jin; Tong County purchased an average of 430,000 jin of peanuts per day in late October, an increase of three times compared with the average daily purchase in early October. Currently, farmers in Zhangjiakou Special District alone sell about 3 million jin of various oil crops to the state every day. In order to facilitate farmers' sales in the face of a large number of oil crops coming onto the market, supply and marketing cooperatives in Xuanhua, Yangyuan, Zhangbei, and other three counties have recently added seven more purchase points.

    山东省广大农民踊跃缴纳公粮出卖余粮
    河北省各地农民把大量油料卖给国家
    山东省农业税秋征和秋季粮食统购工作现已全面展开，有些地区已经开始送粮入库。
    山东各地在各级党委统一领导下，召开了一系列的干部会议，在进一步提高干部社会主义觉悟的基础上，具体交代了秋粮征购的政策和办法。各地干部深入群众进行宣传时，采用组织回忆对比、算细账等办法，具体说明了踊跃缴纳公粮和出卖余粮的意义。现在，广大农民正在“支援国家社会主义工业化，支援解放台湾，支援灾区人民”的口号下，积极缴公粮，卖余粮。宁阳县第一区茅庄农民在十月二十一日和二十二日两天内，就把十六万八千多斤公粮全部缴齐；到十月二十六日，他们卖给国家的余粮有十八万多斤。博兴县第一区伏李乡农民送入国家粮库的粮食，现在已经有六十六万九千多斤。在送粮入库以前，全乡广泛开展了晒粮运动。农民王官美说：“卖好粮食给国家，是农民的光荣。咱们的粮食要千万晒干、簸好，不叫国家受到损失。”在送粮的前一天，他们把早已晒干的粮食用簸箕簸了一遍，并且又晒了一天。
    目前，各地统购和征收入库的粮食，数量不断增加。据泰安、济宁、临沂、胶州四个专区的统计，到十月底止购粮数量比九月份增加两倍以上。

    河北省今年的油料作物获得丰收，各地农民及时把各种油料踊跃卖给国家。到十月底，仅据张家口专区各县和通县的统计，就收购花生、胡麻籽、油菜籽等油料六千一百三十多万斤。其中张北县已经完成第四季度收购油料计划百分之七十五；通县十月份收购花生总量，比去年同期增加了四倍以上。
    最近各地油料上市量不断增加。束鹿县每天的花生上市量，由八千斤增加到九万斤；商都县每天的油料收购量，由十月初的二十五万斤上升到五十七万斤；通县十月下旬平均每天收购花生四十三万斤，比上旬每天收购量增加了三倍。现在，仅张家口专区的农民，每天就卖给国家各种油料三百万斤左右。宣化、阳原、张北等三县的供销合作社在油料大量上市的情况下，为了便利农民出售，最近又增设了收购点七处。　　　　　　（王英民）
