    Comrades! Today we bid farewell to Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky, a loyal son of the Soviet people, an outstanding statesman, and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Soviet legal workers, together with all the people, deeply grieve this significant loss.
    Comrade Vyshinsky dedicated many years of his life, his vigorous energy, and extraordinary talents to practical work in the institutions of the Soviet Ministry of Justice and to resolving issues in Soviet jurisprudence.
    The Party placed Comrade Vyshinsky in important positions in the state apparatus – including the Soviet Ministry of Justice.
    During his work in the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Procurator's Office, and the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Federation, and later as the Procurator General of the Soviet Union, Comrade Vyshinsky consistently demonstrated Bolshevik enthusiasm and meticulousness, love for the great motherland, and hatred for the enemies of the motherland.
    Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky combined his extensive practical activities in the institutions of the Ministry of Justice and other important government departments with particularly rich scientific work in Soviet jurisprudence. Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky received a Stalin Prize for one of his outstanding works in this field.
    Throughout Comrade Vyshinsky's service in the institutions of the Soviet Ministry of Justice, and in his other governmental and diplomatic posts, he earned the respect and love of the staff of the Ministry of Justice, who considered him a man who constantly cared about the practice and science of justice, and who considered him worthy of being called the most outstanding Soviet jurist.
    Comrade Vyshinsky dedicated his entire life and outstanding talents to the cause of building communism in our country and to the struggle for world peace.
    He was a loyal son of the Communist Party, he served his people, his beloved motherland, until his last breath, and he contributed all his energy and knowledge to the work of making the motherland strong and prosperous.
    The glorious life of Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Soviet people.

    在追悼维辛斯基大会上
    苏联司法部长戈尔谢宁的讲话
    同志们！今天我们要和苏联人民的忠实的儿子、杰出的政治家、苏联共产党中央委员会委员安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基同志告别了。
    苏联的法律工作者同全体人民一起为这一重大的损失而深感悲痛。
    维辛斯基同志曾以他一生中的许多年月、他的生气蓬勃的精力和非凡的才能在苏联司法部各机构中从事实际工作和解决苏联法学上的问题。
    党把维辛斯基同志安插在国家机器——包括苏联司法部——中的重要职位上。
    维辛斯基同志在苏联最高法院、最高检察署和俄罗斯联邦人民司法委员部工作期间，以及随后担任苏联检察长期间，始终表现出布尔什维克的热情和一丝不苟的精神，表现出对伟大的祖国的热爱和对祖国的敌人的痛恨。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基把他在司法部各机构和政府的其他重要部门中的广泛的实际活动同他在苏联法学方面的特别丰富的科学工作结合了起来。安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基由于他在这方面的出色著作之一而获得了一项斯大林奖金。
    维辛斯基同志在苏联司法部各机构中服务的整个期间，和他在政府和外交的其他岗位上服务一样，获得了司法部各机构工作人员的尊敬和热爱，他们认为他是一个不断关心司法的实践和科学的人，他们认为他配称为最杰出的苏维埃法学家。
    维辛斯基同志把他整个的一生和卓越的才能，贡献给我国建设共产主义的工作，贡献给争取世界和平的斗争。
    他是共产党的忠实的儿子，他为他的人民、他的亲爱的祖国服务到最后一息，他把他的全部精力和知识贡献给使祖国强大和繁荣的工作。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基的光荣的一生将在苏联人民心中永志不朽。
