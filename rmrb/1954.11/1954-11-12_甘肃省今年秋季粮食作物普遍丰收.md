Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 11th: Gansu Province has achieved a general bumper harvest of autumn grain crops this year. The province's more than 25 million mu of autumn fields are expected to yield an average of over 133 jin per mu, an increase of 10% compared to last year. The autumn harvest has now basically ended throughout the province, and farmers are joyfully calculating their increased income compared to previous years. In the seven counties of Qingyang, Ningxian, Zhengning, and Heshui in the upper reaches of the Jing River, the total output of 2.79 million mu of autumn fields increased by about 20% compared to last year. In the seven counties of Yuzhong, Dingxi, and Huining in the arid mountainous areas of the central region, thanks to the arduous struggle of farmers against natural disasters such as drought, wind, frost, and hail, the average yield per mu of 3.52 million mu of autumn fields increased by more than 47% compared to last year. In the Yinchuan Special District of the northern Yellow River Plain, where autumn fields had already yielded a bumper harvest last year, this year's harvest surpassed last year's, with the highest increase being 90 jin per mu. Autumn fields in the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region, and the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region also yielded bumper harvests. Among them, the average yield per mu of autumn fields in the main agricultural areas of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region reached more than 180 jin, an increase of 49% compared to last year. The autumn harvests of more than 500 agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province were all very good, with most yielding 10% to 40% more than ordinary farmers.

    甘肃省今年秋季粮食作物普遍丰收
    据新华社兰州十一日电：甘肃省今年秋季粮食作物普遍丰收。全省两千五百多万亩秋田，预计每亩平均产量在一百三十三斤以上，比去年增产一成。现在全省秋收已基本结束，农民正喜气洋洋地计算着比往年增多的收入。泾河上游的庆阳、宁县、正宁、合水等七县，二百七十九万亩秋田总产量比去年增加百分之二十左右。中部干旱山区的榆中、定西、会宁等七县，由于农民和旱、风、霜、雹等自然灾害作了艰苦斗争，三百五十二万亩秋田平均每亩比去年增产百分之四十七以上。北部黄河平原银川专区的秋田去年曾经丰收，今年收成又超过去年，最高每亩比去年增产九十斤。西海固回族自治区、河东回族自治区、甘南藏族自治区等地的秋田也都丰收。其中甘南藏族自治区主要农业区的秋田，每亩平均产量达一百八十多斤，比去年增产百分之四十九。全省五百多个农业生产合作社的秋田收成都很好，大多比一般农民多收一成到四成。
