Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company

In the past few years, thanks to the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company has greatly expanded its production capacity and improved its technical level. It has now become a new socialist enterprise capable of building various ships such as oil tankers, passenger ships, barges, tugboats, and offshore work vessels. At the same time, with the vigorous help of Soviet experts, it has cultivated China's own shipbuilding talents. The achievements made by the Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company in recent years embody the Soviet Union's concern and assistance for China's socialist construction and have become a crystallization of the great Sino-Soviet friendship. The Soviet shares in this company, along with the Soviet shares in the other three joint-stock companies, will be completely transferred to China starting from January 1st next year.

    The above picture is a corner of the exterior view of the Dalian Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company.
    This is a 1,200-horsepower ocean-going tugboat, now completed, undergoing sea trials.
    Liu Xianhuan (center), the director of the shipyard, used to be a riveter. Now, he is familiar with a complete set of advanced Soviet shipbuilding operating methods and has initially grasped the practical knowledge of shipbuilding technical guidance and management. This is Liu Xianhuan instructing workers on multi-electrode welding.
    This is the workshop of the mechanical plant of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company. This workshop, like other workshops, is equipped with many new Soviet machines.
    Electric welding is widely used in shipbuilding, replacing rivets, which saves steel plates and rivets, reduces the weight and resistance of ships, and speeds up navigation. This is Liu Zhiguang, a worker in Zhang Hongzeng's electric welding team, and a female apprentice, further studying how to master automatic welding operation.
    The development of design work in recent years shows the growth of the company's shipbuilding technical force. Many design technicians are workers by origin. This is Soviet expert Chekalov, the head of the design department, guiding Chinese intern Yuan Zhongsheng in designing drawings.

    Anchor chains are one of the products produced in large quantities by the shipbuilding company. Tang Liyan (center), a representative to the National People's Congress and a labor model in Dalian-Luda, workers Cheng Yuanqin and Deng Yongchun, with the help of Soviet experts, learned advanced Soviet methods of manufacturing anchor chains and successfully trial-produced various specifications of anchor chains. This is the scene of them studying how to continue to improve product quality.
    After the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué was published, workers and cadres in various departments and workshops responded to the call of the Party committee to summarize advanced Soviet experience and advanced working methods to welcome the new tasks after the company is completely managed by China starting from January 1st next year. This is technician Xu Dianli (right) of the fitter's workshop and Shi Guoqing (center), the advanced team leader of the main engine group, summarizing the advanced experience of turbine steam and searching line work.

    大连中苏造船公司
    大连中苏造船公司在过去几年中，由于苏联全面无私的帮助，大大地扩大了生产能力和提高了技术水平，现在已经成为能够建造油船、客船、驳船、拖船和海上工作船等各种船舶的社会主义的新企业。同时，由于苏联专家的大力帮助，这里已经培养出我国自己的造船业的人材。大连中苏造船公司几年来所取得的成就，体现了苏联对我国社会主义建设事业的关怀和援助，成为中苏伟大友谊的结晶。这个公司中的苏联股份将在明年一月一日起连同其他三个股份公司的苏联股份一起全部移交我国。
    上图是大连中苏造船公司外景的一角。
    这是制造完成的一千二百匹马力的远洋拖轮正在试航。
    造船厂厂长刘宪宦（中），以前是铆工工人，现在已经熟悉了一套完整的苏联先进的造船操作方法，初步掌握了造船的技术指导和管理的实际知识。这是刘宪宦在指导工人多条电焊法。
    这是中苏造船公司机械厂车间。这个车间和其他车间一样，装备着许多苏联的新式机器。
    造船技术上普遍采用了电焊法造船，用电焊代替铆钉，既节省了钢板和铆钉，又减轻了船舶体重和阻力，加快了航行速度。这是张洪增电焊组工人刘志广和女学工在进一步研究如何掌握自动电焊操作法。
    从设计工作几年来的发展可以看出整个公司造船技术力量的成长。很多设计技师都是工人出身的。这是苏联专家、设计科科长切卡洛在指导中国实习生袁忠圣设计图样。
    在造船公司造船台现场研究工作的总工程师、苏联专家里索夫斯基（左）和副总工程师郑于俭。
    锚链是造船公司大量生产的产品之一。全国人民代表大会代表、旅大市劳动模范唐立言（中），工人程远钦和邓永春在苏联专家帮助下，学习苏联先进的制造锚链法，试制各种不同规格的锚链，获得了成功。这是他们正在研究如何继续提高产品质量的情形。
    中苏会谈公报公布后，各科室、车间的工人和干部都响应党委的号召，总结苏联先进经验和先进工作方法，迎接明年一月一日起完全由我国经营后的新任务。这是钳工厂技师徐典礼（右）和主机组先进组长史国庆（中）等在总结轮机汽并找线工作的先进经验。
