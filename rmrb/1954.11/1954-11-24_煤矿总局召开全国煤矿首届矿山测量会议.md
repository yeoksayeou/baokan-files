The Coal Mine Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened the First National Mine Surveying Conference in Tangshan from November 11th to 16th.

The conference pointed out that mine surveying work is the "eyes" of the coal mining industry. Only with accurate survey data and drawings can the study of mine geology and the design of mining and tunneling have a reliable basis. However, for a long time, China's mine surveying work has lagged behind the needs of mine geology, tunneling, and coal mining, resulting in a very unbalanced situation in the three main production links of underground geology, tunneling, and coal mining. Accidents such as water inrush and coal loss occur frequently, causing losses to the state. In order to change this situation, the conference determined that the tasks of mine surveying personnel in coal mines in the future are: to measure the existing mine roadways in a timely and complete manner, draw up mine surveying maps, and check the rationality of coal seam mining and the correctness of tunneling directions; to measure the dynamics of coal reserves, coal production, and losses, participate in the preparation of quarterly and annual production plans, improve the coal recovery rate, and fully tap the production potential of existing mines. For newly built and renovated mines, in addition to providing reliable data on coal reserves and coal seam distribution in a timely manner, surveying personnel should carry out a series of surveying work on wellbore masonry, installation of tank beams, and the direction and position of bottomhole yards and roadways to ensure project speed and improve project quality. At the same time, surveying personnel should regularly observe and study the rock strata movement process above the goaf, protect ground buildings, and ensure safe production in the mine.

The conference decided that in the future, it is necessary to vigorously promote the advanced experience of Soviet mine surveying work and systematically reform the mine surveying work of coal mines nationwide. The conference also put forward requirements to coal mining enterprises at all levels on issues such as establishing and improving specialized surveying agencies, and improving the political ideology and technical level of surveying personnel.

    煤矿总局召开全国煤矿首届矿山测量会议
    燃料工业部煤矿管理总局在十一月十一日到十六日在唐山召开了全国煤矿第一届矿山测量会议。
    会议指出，矿山测量工作是煤矿工业的“眼睛”，只有精确的测量资料和图纸，才能使矿井地质的研究和采掘的设计有可靠的依据。但是，我国的矿山测量工作，长期以来赶不上矿井地质、掘进和采煤的需要，造成井下地质、掘进和采煤三个主要生产环节很不平衡，经常发生透水、丢煤等事故，给国家造成损失。为了改变这种情况，会议确定今后煤矿矿山测量工作人员的任务是：对现有矿井的巷道，要及时完整的测量出来，并绘制成矿山测量图，检查煤层合理开采程度和掘进方向的正确性；测量煤藏量动态、煤的产量和损失，参加编制季度和年度生产计划，提高煤的回采率，充分发挥现有矿井的生产潜力。对新建和改建的矿井，测量工作人员除及时提供煤藏量、煤层分布等可靠资料外，对井筒砌?、安装罐梁和井底车场、巷道的方向和位置等，要进行一系列的测量工作，以保证工程速度和提高工程质量。同时，测量工作人员要经常观测、研究矿井采空区上面的岩层移动过程，保护地面建筑和矿井安全生产。
    会议决定今后要大力推广苏联矿山测量工作的先进经验，有系统地改革全国煤矿的矿山测量工作。会议并就建立和健全测量工作专门机构，提高测量工作人员的政策思想和技术水平等方面的问题，向各级煤矿企业提出了要求。　（新华社）
