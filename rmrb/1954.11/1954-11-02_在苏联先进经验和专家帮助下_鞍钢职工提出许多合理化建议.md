Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 1st: The technical innovation movement at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has made new progress with the help of Soviet advanced experience and Soviet experts. In the third quarter, more than four thousand employees put forward more than three thousand rationalization proposals, which greatly promoted the production of various factories and mines. Based on only two hundred and sixty rationalization proposals, more than 12 billion yuan of wealth can be created for the country.

This year, Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant originally planned to increase production and save 8 billion yuan for the country. However, up to now, through the technical innovation movement, the chemical plant's employees have created more than 10.9 billion yuan of wealth for the country. After learning from Soviet advanced experience, the employees of the refined benzene workshop changed the semi-continuous distillation operation to a continuous operation, which can increase production and save more than 1.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country every year. Workers in the tar workshop, such as Wang Liyan, proposed a plan to recover light oil, which effectively utilizes light oil that was not well used in the past, creating more than 1.8 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year. The birthplace of the technical innovation movement in Anshan Iron and Steel, the small rolling mill, with the help of Soviet experts, has successfully trial-produced 16 cm upright anti-circumferential discs, automatic wire rod delivery machines, and other equipment, moving the mechanization and automation movement another step forward. The proposal of Song Ruiyu and others from the primary rolling mill to increase the steel turning speed, and Guo Deqing's proposal to solve the problem of circulating water in the soaking pit to save burner heads, can increase production and savings by a total of 3.4 billion yuan. Huang Xinghai's Clever Hands Group from the casting pipe plant collectively created an automatic red cloth wrapping machine, increasing work efficiency by 14 times. Chen Fengji, a carpenter from the repair shop of the Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine, created a universal automatic sawing machine, which also increased the work efficiency of carpenters by four to five times.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 1st: With the help of Soviet experts, the old equipment of the primary rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has regained its vitality. The output of this primary rolling mill in the twenty-nine days of October this year was more than the total output of the eight months of 1949. From the primary rolling mill, Anshan Iron and Steel's various rolling mills have received more and better steel billets than before.

The primary rolling mill is an important production department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. A large number of steel ingots from the steelmaking plant must first be rolled into various shapes of steel billets before they can be supplied to various rolling mills. However, because the machinery in this plant is relatively old and the equipment is not balanced, the steel ingots sent from the steelmaking plant are often not completely rolled, while the various rolling mills cannot get enough steel billets. This year, with the help of Soviet experts, the employees of the primary rolling mill have carried out a series of measures focusing on improving the efficiency of the primary rolling mill equipment. For example, the large motor that supplies power to the primary rolling mill has not been overhauled for more than 20 years to avoid affecting the production of various rolling mills. When the temperature is high, the motor often experiences "desoldering" and cannot operate normally. In the past, the only way to deal with this problem was to take the negative approach of reducing power generation. This year, Soviet experts helped the plant improve the motor's ventilation equipment and strengthen maintenance work. The original capacity of the motor has been restored, and the number of accidents has been greatly reduced. Last year, there were a total of 33 "desoldering" incidents, but only seven have occurred so far this year. There are also two continuous rolling mills in the primary rolling mill that are used to roll smaller steel billets. Because the groove shape is too small, many steel billets that should be rolled by it must also be rolled by the primary rolling mill. This year, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the groove shape of one of the continuous rolling mills was enlarged by one-fifth, which doubled the number of steel billets that this continuous rolling mill can roll, greatly reducing the burden on the primary rolling mill. After this series of measures, the rolling capacity of the primary rolling mill has been greatly improved. The average hourly output in the twenty-five days of October this year was 32% higher than the average hourly output for the entire last year.

    在苏联先进经验和专家帮助下
    鞍钢职工提出许多合理化建议
    【新华社鞍山一日电】鞍山钢铁公司的技术革新运动，在苏联先进经验和苏联专家帮助下，又有新的进展。在第三季度内，有四千多职工提出了三千多件合理化建议，大大推进了各厂矿的生产。其中仅以二百六十件合理化建议计算，就可为国家创造一百二十多亿元的财富。
    鞍钢化工总厂职工今年原计划为国家增产节约八十亿元，可是到现在，化工总厂职工通过技术革新运动已为国家创造了一百零九亿元的财富。精苯车间职工学习苏联先进经验，把半连续的蒸馏操作改为连续操作后，每年可以增产节约十七亿元以上的财富。焦油车间工人王立岩等提出回收轻油的建议，把过去没有很好利用的轻油利用起来，每年将为国家创造十八亿元以上的财富。鞍钢技术革新运动的发源地——小型轧钢厂的职工，在苏联专家帮助下，今年又试制成功了十六公分立反围盘、线材成品自动运送机等，使机械化自动化运动又前进了一步。初轧厂宋瑞玉等提高翻钢速度的建议，郭德清的解决均热炉循环水问题以节省烧嘴头的建议，两项共可增产节约达三十四亿元。铸管厂黄兴海窍门小组集体创造自动缠报红机，提高工作效率十四倍。樱桃园铁矿修理车间木工陈凤吉创造万能自动制材车，也使木工的工作效率提高四倍到五倍。
    【新华社鞍山一日电】在苏联专家帮助下，鞍山钢铁公司初轧厂的旧有设备恢复了青春能力。这个初轧厂今年十月份二十九天的产量就比一九四九年八个月的产量总和还要多。从初轧厂里，鞍钢各个轧钢厂得到了比以前更多更好的钢坯。
    初轧厂是鞍山钢铁公司的一个重要的生产部门，每天从炼钢厂出来的大批钢锭，都要先经过它轧成各种形状的钢坯，然后才能供给各个轧钢厂使用。但是这个厂因为机器比较陈旧，设备也不平衡，所以从炼钢厂送来的钢锭往往轧不完，而各个轧钢厂却又得不到足够的钢坯使用。今年在苏联专家的帮助下，初轧厂职工围绕着提高初轧机设备效率的问题进行了一系列的措施。如供给初轧机动力的大型马达，因为避免影响各轧钢厂的生产，已经有二十多年没有大检修了。在温度高时，马达就常常发生“脱焊”现象，不能正常运转。以前对待这个问题只是采取减少发电量的消极方法。今年，苏联专家帮助厂里改善马达的通风设备，加强维护工作，马达的原有能力恢复了，事故也大大地减少了。去年一共发生三十三次“脱焊”现象，今年到现在只发生过七次。初轧厂里还有两部轧制较小的钢坯用的连轧机，这些连轧机因为孔型太小，许多应当由它轧制的钢坯也不得不由初轧机轧。今年根据苏联专家建议，把其中的一部连轧机孔型扩大五分之一，使得这部连轧机能轧制的钢坯增多一倍，大大减轻了初轧机的负担。经过这样一系列的措施，初轧机的轧制能力大大提高，今年十月份二十五天内的每小时的平均产量就比去年全年每小时的平均产量提高了百分之三十二。
