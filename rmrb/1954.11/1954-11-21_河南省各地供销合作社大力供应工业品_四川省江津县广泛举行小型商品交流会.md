Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Henan Province Vigorously Supply Industrial Products
    Small-Scale Commodity Exchange Meetings Widely Held in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province

    The primary markets in various parts of Henan Province are organized mainly by supply and marketing cooperatives to facilitate material exchange, enabling industrial products to rapidly reach the countryside. In coordination with the unified purchase work, Kangcun in Huojia County organized a material exchange conference in late October, with a total transaction value of 579.26 million yuan; state-owned transactions accounted for 7.37 percent, supply and marketing cooperatives accounted for 52.74 percent, and handicraftsmen and private businesses accounted for 39.89 percent. Liuge Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Qingfeng County studied the current tasks of supply and marketing work and the needs of farmers, broke with conservative thinking in management, and jointly established a Material Exchange Committee with the People's Bank of China, the Tax Bureau, and other units to actively carry out publicity and organizational work. From October 23rd to 28th, they organized three material exchange meetings with a total transaction value of 78.47 million yuan, and the recovered currency accounted for 89 percent of the amount put in circulation. In addition, some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas first printed commodity catalogs and distributed them to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and then sent people to participate in the meetings held by these mutual aid and cooperative organizations to help them, starting with production arrangements, to broadly formulate plans for handling the funds obtained from the sale of agricultural products. Finally, both parties signed combined contracts, with the supply and marketing cooperatives supplying goods in installments. This strengthened the planning of both parties and enabled the rational supply of certain commodities in short supply, thereby increasing the enthusiasm of farmers to sell agricultural products. In late October, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the four districts of Suiping County used this method to sign a batch of combined contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, with a total value of 395.8 million yuan.

    In late October and early November, more than 120 market towns in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, held small-scale commodity exchange meetings to actively promote industrial products and meet the needs of farmers. According to the statistics of exchange meetings in ten market towns including Youxi, Lishi, and Zhutuo, the daily turnover reached 475.4 million yuan, which was more than twice that of usual market days. At the exchange meeting on October 28th, the Youxi Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold 328 woolen sweaters, 669 sneakers, 34 thermos bottles and porcelain basins, and 1,111 feet of cotton cloth in one day. In addition, it also sold a large number of socks, towels, wool yarn, and leather shoes. After selling grain, the members of Jian Shuqing Mutual Aid Team in Dianzi Township bought 1.1 million yuan worth of industrial products from the supply and marketing cooperative in one go. They said, "The working class elder brothers have made so many good things for the farmers, we must strive to increase production next year and support the country's industrial construction." In order to meet the needs of farmers as much as possible, many market towns have also organized peddlers to go deep into the countryside to supply goods. (Cheng Yihua, Deng Huansong)

    河南省各地供销合作社大力供应工业品
    四川省江津县广泛举行小型商品交流会
    河南省各地初级市场，以供销合作社为主组织物资交流，使工业品迅速下乡。获嘉县亢村配合统购工作，在十月下旬组织了物资交流大会，成交总值达五亿七千九百二十六万元；其中国营成交比重占百分之七点三七，供销合作社占百分之五十二点七四，手工业者和私营商业占百分之三十九点八九。清丰县柳格供销合作社研究了当前供销工作的任务和农民的需要，打破了经营上的保守思想，同人民银行、税务所等单位联合成立物资交流委员会，积极进行宣传和组织工作。他们从十月二十三日到二十八日，共组织了三次物资交流会，成交总值达七千八百四十七万元，回笼的货币占投放数额的百分之八十九。另外，有些地区的供销合作社事先印出商品目录，分送给农业生产合作社和互助组，然后派人参加这些互助合作组织举行的会议，帮助他们从安排生产入手大体上订出处理出售农产品后所得款项的计划，最后双方签订结合合同，由供销合作社分期供应货物。这样便加强了双方的计划性，并使某些数量不足的商品得到合理的供应，因而提高了农民出售农产品的积极性。遂平县四个区的供销合作社在十月下旬运用这种方法，同农业生产合作社和互助组签订了一批结合合同，总值达三亿九千五百八十万元。　（本报河南记者站）
    十月下旬和十一月上旬，四川省江津县一百二十多个场镇举行了小型商品交流会，积极推销工业品，供应农民的需要。据油溪、李市、朱沱等十个场镇交流会的统计，每天的营业额达四亿七千五百四十万元，比平常赶场的日子增加两倍多。油溪供销合作社在十月二十八日的交流会上，一天卖出绒衣三百二十八件、球鞋六百六十九双、暖水瓶和瓷盆三十四个、棉布一千一百一十一丈，此外还卖出大批袜子、毛巾、毛线和皮鞋等物品。该县店子乡蹇树清互助组的组员们卖粮以后，集体到供销合作社一次买了一百一十万元的工业品。他们说：“工人老大哥给农民做了这样多的好东西，我们要争取明年增产更多的粮食，支援国家工业建设。”为了尽量供应农民的需要，许多场镇还组织货郎担深入乡村供应商品。　（程宜华、邓宦松）
