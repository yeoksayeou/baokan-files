Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent the following note to the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in China on November 20, 1954. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and has the honor to notify that the Government of the People's Republic of China received on November 13, 1954, the Soviet Government's note regarding the convocation of a Pan-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.

The Government of the People's Republic of China considers that the London Agreements and Paris Accords, aimed at reviving West German militarism, are in complete violation of international agreements concerning the German question and are in complete contradiction with the task of consolidating European security and restoring German national unity. It not only violates the interests of the German people, but also the peaceful interests of the people of Europe and the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China firmly opposes the London Agreements and Paris Accords, which seriously threaten European security and world peace.

The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that only the establishment of an effective collective security system based on all European countries can peacefully resolve the German question and guarantee the collective security of Europe. The Soviet Government's proposal to convene a Pan-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system is another major effort to peacefully resolve the German question and guarantee the security of all European countries. The Soviet government's proposal is very timely.

The Government of the People's Republic of China fully endorses the Soviet Government's proposal and is prepared to send representatives to attend the Pan-European conference proposed by the Soviet Government as observers.

	This note to the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

	Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
		November 20, 1954, in Beijing

    我国外交部复照苏联政府
    完全赞成苏联关于召开全欧会议的建议
    并准备派遣代表以观察员身份参加会议
    【新华社二十日讯】中华人民共和国外交部在一九五四年十一月二十日以下项照会送交苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻中国大使馆。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟大使馆致意，并谨通知：中华人民共和国政府于一九五四年十一月十三日收到苏联政府关于为讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题召开全欧会议的照会。
    中华人民共和国政府认为以复活西德军国主义为目的的伦敦协议和巴黎协定完全违反有关德国问题的国际协议，是同巩固欧洲安全，恢复德国国家统一的任务完全背道而驰的。它不仅违背德国人民的利益，而且违背欧洲各国人民和全世界人民的和平利益。中华人民共和国政府坚决反对这个严重威胁欧洲安全和世界和平的伦敦协议和巴黎协定。
    中华人民共和国政府认为：只有建立一个以全体欧洲国家为基础的有效的集体安全体系，才能和平解决德国问题和保障欧洲的集体安全。苏联政府关于召开全欧会议，讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，是为了和平解决德国问题，保障所有欧洲国家的安全的又一次重大努力。苏联政府这一建议是十分适时的。
    中华人民共和国政府完全赞成苏联政府的建议，并准备派遣代表以观察员身份参加苏联政府建议的全欧会议。
