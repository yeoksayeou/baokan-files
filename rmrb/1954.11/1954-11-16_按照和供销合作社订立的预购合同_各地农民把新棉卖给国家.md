Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: Before the unified purchase of cotton began in various cotton-producing areas, farmers sold a portion of their new cotton in September and October according to the cotton advance purchase contracts signed with supply and marketing cooperatives. By the end of October, according to incomplete statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives of twelve provinces and cities, the cotton sold by farmers according to advance purchase contracts accounted for 20.7% of the total advance purchase volume. This batch of new cotton has successively begun to be transported to textile factories. The progress of guiding farmers in clearing advance purchase contracts is uneven. Hebei Province recovered 37.5% of the total advance purchase volume, Henan Province accounted for 19.4%, and Sichuan Province performed the best, having recovered 58.5%. Other areas, such as Shanxi Province, have recovered less.

Before and after cotton sowing this year, the state entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives to sign cotton advance purchase contracts with farmers, paying out more than 350 billion yuan in deposits, which greatly supported this year's cotton production and helped farmers overcome many production and livelihood difficulties. After the new cotton was harvested, farmers felt the benefits of the state's advance purchase of cotton and sold cotton according to the advance purchase contracts. In areas with better clearance of advance purchase contracts, attention was paid to reviewing and verifying advance purchase contracts before the new cotton was harvested, assigning special personnel to be responsible, and binding the signed advance purchase contracts by township and village, according to contract number, into volumes. They went deep into each village to carefully verify the planted acreage, advance purchase quantity, deposit amount received, and contract procedures with the farmers who signed the contracts. Some strengthened the education of cotton farmers on abiding by contracts, using mutual aid and cooperation organizations as a foundation, and convened meetings of contract household representatives, cooperative member representatives, and farmer representatives through village cadres and cooperative directors and supervisors, repeatedly explaining the importance of abiding by contract credit, and detailing the methods and procedures for clearing advance purchase contracts and recovering deposits. They also carried out publicity and education among the vast number of cotton farmers through them.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 15th: Eighty-two agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanghe County, Shandong Province, have decided to sell 675,000 jin of seed cotton in one go according to the state's decree on unified cotton purchase, and have already sold more than 340,000 jin of seed cotton.

This year, the eighty-two agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanghe County planted 5,059 mu of cotton. During the cotton growing season, the Shanghe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative pre-purchased more than 420,000 jin of seed cotton from each agricultural producers' cooperative, and pre-paid a large amount of deposit to the farmers. After receiving the advance deposit, the agricultural producers' cooperatives actively improved cultivation techniques and increased yield per unit area. More than twenty agricultural producers' cooperatives, such as Victory, Progress, and Smooth, purchased new farm implements and double-wheeled double-shared plows, and deep plowing in cotton fields was all more than five inches deep. Each cooperative also purchased insecticides and promptly controlled cotton pests, so that all cotton received a bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that the cotton of the eighty-two agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county can harvest an average of 145 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is 20 to 35 jin more per mu than the cotton of local mutual aid groups and individual farmers. Now, these agricultural producers' cooperatives are selling cotton in accordance with the state's unified purchase method.

    按照和供销合作社订立的预购合同
    各地农民把新棉卖给国家
    【新华社十五日讯】在各产棉区开始棉花统购工作前，九、十月份农民按照和供销合作社订立的棉花预购合同，出卖了一部分新棉。到十月底，据十二个省、市供销合作社的不完全统计，农民按照预购合同出售的棉花占预购总数的百分之二十点七。这批新棉已先后开始运往纺织工厂。领导农民清理预购合同的工作进展的不平衡，河北省收回数占预购总数的百分之三十七点五。河南省占百分之十九点四。四川省完成的最好，已收回百分之五十八点五。其他如山西省等地，收回的较少。
    今年棉花播种前后，国家委托供销合作社和农民订立棉花预购合同，共付出了三千五百多亿元的定金，对今年的棉花生产起了很大支援作用，帮助农民克服了不少生产上和生活上的困难。新棉收摘后，农民感到国家预购棉花的好处，就按照预购合同卖棉。清理预购合同较好的地区，在新棉采摘前，就注意了复查核对预购合同，指定专人负责，把所签订的预购合同，分乡分村，按合同号码，装订成册，深入各村分别和签订合同的农民，详细核对种植亩数、预购数量，领取定金额及合同手续等。有的加强对棉农遵守合同的教育，以互助合作组织为基础，通过乡村干部、合作社理监事召开合同户代表、社员代表和农民代表会议，反复说明遵守合同信用的重要意义，详细交代了清理预购合同收回定金的办法和手续，并通过他们向广大种棉农民进行了宣传和教育。
    【新华社济南十五日电】山东省商河县八十二个农业生产合作社决定按照国家关于棉花统购的法令，一次认售籽棉六十七万五千多斤，现已出售了籽棉三十四万多斤。
    今年，商河县的八十二个农业生产合作社种植了五千零五十九亩棉花。在棉花生长期间，商河县的供销合作社分别向各农业生产合作社预购了四十二万多斤籽棉，预付给农民大量定金。各农业生产合作社得到预付定金以后，积极改进耕作技术，提高单位面积产量。胜利、前进、顺利等二十多个农业生产合作社，购买新式农具和双轮双铧犁，棉田深耕都在五寸以上。各社又购买了杀虫药剂，及时除治了棉花虫害，使今年棉花全部得到丰收。据估计，全县八十二个农业生产合作社的棉花，平均每亩可收籽棉一百四十五斤，比当地互助组和单干农户的棉花每亩多产二十斤到三十五斤。现在，这些农业生产合作社正按照国家统购的办法出卖棉花。
