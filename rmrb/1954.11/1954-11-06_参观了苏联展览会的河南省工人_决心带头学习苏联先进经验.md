    Henan Workers Who Visited the Soviet Exhibition
    Determined to Take the Lead in Learning from Advanced Soviet Experience
    [This newspaper] Workers from the Henan delegation who visited the Soviet Exhibition of Economic and Cultural Achievements, upon returning to their factories, have resolved to take the lead in learning from advanced Soviet experience and improve production. They are very excited to tell their colleagues about the great achievements of Soviet construction they have seen. Yan Qingxiang, foreman of the Fourth Engineering Section of the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company, said, "From the Soviet exhibition, we saw our tomorrow; but how do we strive for this bright future? Only by learning from the Soviet Union." He told everyone: "We can only dig eight cubic meters of soil in a day's work on the construction site; a Soviet driver operating a large crane can dig that much soil in just sixteen minutes. When we do welding work, we always have to hold a mask and use pliers to clamp the welding rod to weld things; but the Soviet Union has an automated machine that only requires a worker to press a button to automatically weld things. We must learn from the Soviet Union and improve our technical level." Sheng Wan, a model worker in Zhengzhou's industry and a fine yarn worker at the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, studied several advanced working methods created by Soviet textile workers when she visited the industrial hall of the Soviet exhibition. After returning to the factory, she and the workers studied and tried out these advanced methods. The results of the trial proved that these advanced methods were far superior to the methods they had used in the past. When they tried a method called "fine yarn replacing coarse yarn twisted bundle method," they were able to guarantee 100% no yarn breakage. Sheng Wan said that she would apply these advanced methods to her work to improve product quality.

    参观了苏联展览会的河南省工人
    决心带头学习苏联先进经验
    【本报讯】参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的河南省参观团中的工人回到所在工厂后，都决心带头学习苏联先进经验，搞好生产。他们非常兴奋地把自己所看到的苏联建设的伟大成就，告诉给自己本单位的职工。河南省建筑工程公司第四工程处工长阎庆祥说：“从苏联展览会上，我们看到了我们的明天；但我们怎样争取这美好的明天呢？只有学习苏联。”他告诉大家：“我们在工地上一个人干一天活，只能挖八立方土；苏联一个司机开动大吊车，只要十六分钟，就能挖这么多土。我们做电焊工作，总是要拿着眼罩，用钳子夹着焊条焊东西；可是苏联有一种自动化的机器，它只由一个工人按下电钮，就可自动地焊东西。我们要学习苏联，提高我们的技术水平。”郑州市工业劳动模范、国营郑州第二棉纺织厂细纱女工盛婉在参观苏联展览会的工业馆时，曾经学习了苏联纺织工人创造的几种先进工作方法。她回到工厂以后，就同工人们一道学习和试用这些先进方法。试用的结果证明：这些先进方法比她们过去所用的方法优越得多。她们在试用一种名叫“细纱换粗纱包捻法”时，能百分之百地保证不断头。盛婉表示要把这些先进方法运用到工作中去，提高产品质量。
