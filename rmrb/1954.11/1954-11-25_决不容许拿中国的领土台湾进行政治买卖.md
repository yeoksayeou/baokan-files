After the U.S. Secretary of State made absurd remarks about the so-called status of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, British Foreign Secretary Eden, on November 19, spoke on a BBC television program about Taiwan and the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, saying, "If we can ease the tensions in these smaller islands, then we may be able to make progress on the Taiwan issue."

Eden's remarks have attracted attention because there have been continuous reports recently that Washington and London are plotting a so-called plan to resolve the Taiwan issue. This so-called plan generally requires that the Chinese people not only refrain from liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but also refrain from liberating the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Instead, the United States would "persuade" the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to "withdraw" from these islands, that is, to preserve the strength of Chiang's bandit troops on these islands so that they would not be completely annihilated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After doing so, the United States would conclude a so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, with the United States guaranteeing the latter's "independence" and "security."

These reports also promote that if the Chinese people abandon the plan to liberate Taiwan, that is, allow the U.S. aggressive bloc to occupy China's territory of Taiwan indefinitely, then, as a so-called "quid pro quo," the United States will "ease" its hostile attitude towards China. It is said that this would somehow ease the tensions in the Far East caused by the U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan.

The background behind these propagations is that the U.S. policy of hostility towards the Chinese people is increasingly met with dissatisfaction around the world; the issue of U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan has been placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly; and, in particular, the world has further recognized that the activities of the U.S. naval and air forces in the Chinese coastal areas are a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. World public opinion, including American public opinion, is increasingly strongly opposed to the war policy of the U.S. aggressive bloc and demands that the U.S. Seventh Fleet withdraw from the Taiwan Strait and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

In this situation, the U.S. aggressive bloc attempts to deceive world public opinion by "persuading" the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to "withdraw" from the coastal islands. The U.S. columnist Alsop brothers said in the "Washington Post" on the 17th that this approach could at least make people feel that the United States is not "eager for war." At the same time, the U.S. aggressive bloc attempts to use the empty promise of "easing" its hostile attitude towards China to win the support of other countries for the U.S.'s absurd plans such as "UN trusteeship of Taiwan," "neutralization of Taiwan," and "independent state of Taiwan."

Obviously, the U.S. aggressive bloc attempts to exploit the world's unease about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and its desire for peace to carry out political blackmail, forcing the world to agree to the permanent U.S. occupation of Taiwan. It is not difficult to understand why the U.S. aggressive bloc is actively planning this plan on the one hand, and frantically clamoring that if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, there will inevitably be a military conflict with the United States on the other.

The U.S. aggressive bloc attempts to present such a situation to the people of the world: To avoid war in the Far East, it is necessary to allow the United States to occupy Taiwan for a long time, and only after this can the U.S. aggressive bloc consider "easing" its hostility towards China, which would seemingly satisfy the wishes of those countries that desire to restore normal trade with China.

This reminds people of the bandits in ancient Chinese novels who extort "tolls." However, can peace in the Far East be bought from the U.S. aggressive bloc by selling China's territory of Taiwan?

The current tension in the Chinese coastal areas is entirely due to the U.S. aggressive bloc's armed occupation of Taiwan. The Chinese people's liberation of the coastal islands, like the liberation of Taiwan, is China's internal affair and has nothing to do with any other country, nor does it constitute an international issue. The only dangerous factor causing tension is the military activities carried out by the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the Chinese coastal areas to assist the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and these activities are based on the U.S. policy of occupying Taiwan.

It is conceivable that if the United States does not abandon this policy of occupying Taiwan, and the U.S. armed forces do not withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, that is, if Taiwan remains a base for the United States to create tension in the Far East and threaten China with war, then the tension in the Taiwan Strait will remain rather than ease. Moreover, the division of the territory of an independent country is in itself an act of aggression, which is an act of creating tension and provoking war.

Therefore, handing Taiwan over to the United States for long-term occupation through methods such as "UN trusteeship of Taiwan" will not bring peace to the Far East, but rather long-term tension and instability to the Far East situation. Obviously, to achieve peace in the Far East, the only way is for the U.S. aggressive forces to withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. Any other method is only intentionally or unintentionally helping the U.S. aggressive bloc to realize its conspiracy to divide China's territory and occupy Taiwan for a long time.

Peace in the Far East cannot be achieved by selling China's territory of Taiwan. Those who are plotting to divide China's territory of Taiwan should remember that this is the 1950s, not the 19th century or the early 20th century. The days when a few Western colonial countries could divide China and decide China's fate are long gone. The Chinese people are fully capable of liberating their own territory of Taiwan, and will never allow anyone to engage in dirty political deals with China's territory of Taiwan.

    决不容许拿中国的领土台湾进行政治买卖
    新华社评论员　江南
    在美国国务卿发表了关于台湾和澎湖列岛的所谓地位问题的荒谬言论之后，十一月十九日，英国外交大臣艾登在英国广播公司的电视节目中谈到被蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的台湾和沿海岛屿时说，“如果我们能缓和这些较小岛屿的紧张局势，那末我们就可能能够在台湾问题上取得进展了。”
    艾登的这些话引起了人们的注意，因为最近不断有消息说，华盛顿和伦敦正在策划一个所谓解决台湾问题的计划。这个所谓计划大体上是要求中国人民不但不要解放台湾和澎湖列岛，甚至也不要解放沿海被蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的岛屿，而由美国去“劝说”蒋介石卖国集团“退出”这些岛屿，也就是说要保全在这些岛屿上蒋贼军的实力，使它不至于被中国人民解放军彻底歼灭。在这样做了以后，美国就和蒋介石卖国集团订立所谓“共同安全防御条约”，由美国来保证后者的“独立”和“安全”。
    这些消息还宣传说，如果中国人民放弃了解放台湾的计划，也就是说允许美国侵略集团无限期侵占中国的领土台湾，那末，作为所谓“交换条件”，美国将“缓和”它对中国的敌视态度。据说，这样一来，好像就会使由于美国武装侵占台湾而引起的远东紧张局势缓和下来。
    在这些宣传后面的背景是：美国敌视中国人民的政策愈来愈遭到全世界的不满；美国武装侵占台湾问题已经提到了联合国大会的议事日程上；特别是全世界进一步认识到了美国海空军在中国沿海的活动是对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁。世界舆论，包括美国的舆论，愈来愈强烈地反对美国侵略集团的战争政策，要求美国第七舰队撤出台湾海峡，停止干涉中国的内政。
    在这种情况下，美国侵略集团企图用“劝说”蒋介石卖国集团“退出”沿海岛屿的办法来欺骗世界舆论。美国专栏作家艾尔索普兄弟在十七日的
  “华盛顿邮报”上就说，这种做法至少可以使人觉得美国并不“渴望战争”。同时，美国侵略集团企图用“缓和”对中国的敌视态度的空头支票，来骗取其他国家对于美国的“联合国托管台湾”、“台湾中立化”、“台湾独立国”之类的荒谬计划的支持。
    很明显，美国侵略集团企图利用全世界对于台湾海峡形势的不安和对于和平的渴望，进行政治上的讹诈，来迫使全世界同意由美国永久侵占台湾。这就不难理解：为什么美国侵略集团一方面积极策划这个计划，一方面又拚命叫嚷，如果中国人民解放台湾，就一定会和美国发生军事冲突。
    美国侵略集团企图在全世界人民面前布置这样一种局面：要想避免在远东发生战争，只有允许美国长期侵占台湾，而且只有在这样以后，美国侵略集团才可以考虑“缓和”对中国的敌视，而这样好像就可以使那些渴望与中国恢复正常贸易的国家满足它们的愿望。
    这使人想起了中国古代小说上那些勒索“买路钱”的强盗。然而，远东的和平是可以用出卖中国的领土台湾的办法向美国侵略集团买得到的吗？
    目前中国沿海紧张局势之所以存在，完全是由于美国侵略集团武装侵占了台湾，中国人民解放沿海岛屿，就和解放台湾一样，是中国的内政，不与任何其它国家相干，也不成其为国际问题。唯一引起紧张局势的危险因素是美国海、空军为了协助蒋介石卖国集团而在中国沿海进行的军事活动，而这些活动是根据美国侵占台湾的政策进行的。
    可以想见，如果美国不放弃这种侵占台湾的政策，美国武装力量不从台湾和台湾海峡撤退，这就是说，台湾仍然是美国在远东制造紧张局势、对中国制造战争威胁的一个基地，那末，台湾海峡的紧张局势就仍然保持而不是缓和下来。况且，分割一个独立的国家的领土，其本身就是一个侵略的行为，就是制造紧张局势和挑拨战争的行为。
    因此，用“联合国托管台湾”之类的办法将台湾交给美国长期侵占，所换来的并不是远东的和平，而是远东局势的长期的紧张和不稳定。显然，要获得远东的和平，只有美国的侵略势力撤出台湾和台湾海峡，任何其他办法都不过是有意无意地帮助美国侵略集团来实现它分割中国领土、长期侵占台湾的阴谋。
    远东和平是不能用出卖中国的领土台湾来取得的。那些策划割裂中国的领土台湾的人应该记得，现在是二十世纪五十年代而不是十九世纪或是二十世纪初期。由少数西方殖民国家来瓜分中国、决定中国命运的日子早就过去了。中国人民完全有力量解放自己的领土台湾，也决不容许任何人拿中国的领土台湾进行肮脏的政治买卖。
