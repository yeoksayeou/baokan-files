The China Food Company Promotes Double-Layer Pig Loading Method to Save Expenses

From October 25th to 27th, the China Food Company held a double-layer pig loading method observation meeting at Zhengding Station in Hebei Province to promote the double-layer pig loading method created by Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province. Participants included cadres from the storage and transportation departments of the China Food Company system in fourteen provincial companies including Heilongjiang, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Shaanxi, representatives from the Beijing and Tianjin Railway Administrations and Fengtai, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan Sub-bureaus of the Ministry of Railways, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Commerce and the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce, totaling 125 attendees.

Li Nansheng, Deputy Manager of the China Food Company, reported at the meeting on the significance of promoting the double-layer pig loading method for increasing production and saving resources. In Hebei Province alone, if single-layer transportation is changed to double-layer transportation in the fourth quarter, with each pig saving more than 3,000 yuan in freight, the state can save 800 million yuan in expenses, and at the same time, more than 1,400 train cars can be saved for other transportation.

At the observation meeting, someone first introduced the structure and cost of the double-layer pig rack, and then actually demonstrated the erection of the rack and loading of pigs. Three sets of racks were used this time, loading a total of 450 pigs. One set was the original double-layer rack from Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, and the other two sets were made by imitating the structure of the Lanxi-style rack, combined with the characteristics of northern pigs that like to run and jump, and the experience gained from three trial runs conducted in Baoding and Dongchangshou, Hebei Province in September.

After observation and discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that the double-layer pig loading method is suitable for promotion nationwide; this is an important part of the China Food Company system's efforts to improve business management and carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Through this observation meeting, the relationship between the food company system and the railway transportation department has also been further strengthened. Some provincial food companies have already put forward plans to promote the double-layer pig loading method. For example, Shandong Province currently has 53 sets of double-layer pig racks, but they are too bulky. Representatives from the province plan to modify them after returning and add another 30 to 40 sets, and it is expected that all transportation can be converted to double-layer transportation next year. Hebei Province is preparing to repair and modify 30 sets of double-layer racks, and make another 80 sets, and first focus on trial transportation and promotion in the Changli area.

    China Food Company's Xuchang branch, with the support and help of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, trialled a three-layer pig loading method on September 27th. A railway car loaded with 210 pigs in three layers, traveled 900 kilometers in five days, and safely arrived at Yongdingmen Station in Beijing without a single death.

    In order to promote this experience, the Henan Provincial Company of China Food Company held a three-layer pig loading method observation meeting at Xuchang Station on October 15th. Participants included representatives from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration and its key stations, the Hankou, Luoyang, and other railway transportation sub-bureaus, the Northwest District, Shaanxi Province, Hubei Province Food Companies, and the branches and municipal companies under the Henan Provincial Food Company, totaling 66 people. At the meeting, it took 28 minutes to erect the rack and load the pigs.

    This observation meeting provided an important way for participating units to carry out increasing production and practicing economy. For example, taking the transportation of pigs from Xuchang to Beijing as an example, the average freight cost per pig is 41,000 yuan for single-layer loading, 27,300 yuan per pig for double-layer, and only 23,400 yuan per pig for three-layer. Three-layer loading can save 17,600 yuan per pig compared to single-layer loading. If Henan Province's fourth-quarter pig transfer task is calculated according to Xuchang to Beijing, a total of 2.992 billion yuan can be saved. Adopting the three-layer pig loading method can also save the country's transportation power and support the country's economic construction. According to Henan Province's fourth-quarter pig transfer task, single-layer loading requires a total of 2,430 railway cars, and fully adopting the three-layer pig loading method can save a total of 1,630 railway cars.

### 中国食品公司推广双层装猪法节约开支

    中国食品公司推广双层装猪法节约开支
    十月二十五日到二十七日，中国食品公司在河北省正定车站举行了毛猪双层装载法观摩大会，推广浙江省兰溪县创造的毛猪双层装载法。参加大会的有中国食品公司系统的黑龙江、河北、湖北、江苏、广西、陕西等十四个省公司储运部门的干部，铁道部系统的北京、天津管理局和丰台、石家庄、太原等分局的代表，商业部和河北省商业厅也派人参加，出席的代表共有一百二十五人。
    中国食品公司副经理李南生在会上报告了推广毛猪双层装载法对增产节约的意义。仅河北省如在第四季度将单层装运改为双层装运，每只猪按节省运费三千余元计算，就可为国家节省开支八亿元，同时可以省出一千四百多个火车皮做其他运输。
    观摩大会上，有人首先介绍了双层装猪架子的构造、成本等，然后实际操演了搭架、装猪。这次用了三套架子，共装了四百五十头毛猪。其中有一套是原浙江省兰溪县的双层架子，两套是仿照兰溪式架子的构造，结合北方毛猪爱跑善跳的特性，以及今年九月份先后在河北省保定、东长寿两处进行三次试运的经验制成的。
    经过观摩、讨论，到会代表一致认为，双层装猪法适于在全国范围内推广；这是中国食品公司系统改善经营管理、开展增产节约的重要内容之一。通过这次观摩大会，也进一步密切了食品公司系统和铁路运输部门的关系。有些省的食品公司已提出了推广双层装猪法的计划。如山东省现有五十三套双层装猪架子，但过于笨重，该省代表计划在回去后加以改装，并再增加三、四十套，预计明年可全部改为双层装运。河北省准备修整改制三十套双层架子，另外再作八十套，首先在昌黎地区重点试运推广。  （彦令）

    中国食品公司许昌分公司九月二十七日在郑州铁路管理局支持、帮助下，试行了三层装猪法。一辆车皮三层共装运了二百一十头毛猪，五天经过九百公里，安全运到北京市永定门车站，没有一头死亡。
    为了推广这一经验，十月十五日，中国食品公司河南省公司在许昌车站举行了三层装猪法观摩大会。参加大会的有郑州铁路管理局及所属各重点站，汉口、洛阳等铁路运输分局，西北区、陕西省、湖北省食品公司，河南省食品公司所属各分、市公司的代表，共计六十六人。会上，搭架子、装猪共用了二十八分钟。
    这次观摩大会为到会单位开展增产节约提供了
  一条重要途径。如以许昌往北京运猪为例，单层装运，平均每头毛猪运费为四万一千元，双层每头二万七千三百元，三层每头仅为二万三千四百元，三层装运比单层装运每头可节约一万七千六百元。河南省第四季度毛猪外调任务，如都按许昌到北京计算，即共可节约二十九亿九千二百万元。采用三层装猪法，还可以为国家节省运输力量，支持国家经济建设。按照河南省第四季度毛猪外调任务，单层装猪，共需火车皮二千四百三十辆，全部采用三层装猪法，共可节省车皮一千六百三十辆。  （杨忠杰）
