    Fight Against the Phenomenon of Irresponsible Handling of Letters
    On May 4, 1953, this newspaper forwarded a reader's letter to the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee of Anhui Province (hereinafter referred to as the Prefectural Committee) (exposing the bureaucratic attitude and retaliatory actions of the Secretary Section Chief of the Fuyang Special District Coal Construction Company), requesting the Prefectural Committee to investigate and handle it, and to reply to this newspaper with the handling situation and results. This letter was followed up eight times, and no response was received from the Prefectural Committee. On July 10, 1954, the Fuyang Commissioner's Office of People's Supervision Department suddenly sent such a reply letter regarding the above issue:
      "People's Daily: Regarding the case of Yang Zaiyin's accusation of bureaucratic attitude and retaliation by the Secretary Section Chief of the Coal Construction Company, which your agency forwarded to the Fuyang Prefectural Committee in 1953, the Commissioner's Office Industry and Commerce Section has now understood and handled it.
    The main reason for the delay in this case is that the accused and relevant personnel have been transferred to work, and it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the issue of retaliation. Therefore, the case has only now been closed. Regarding the bureaucratic attitude of Feng Bin, the Secretary Section Chief of the company, in his work and his love issues, since Feng has made a written self-criticism, the leadership believes that the self-criticism is relatively profound and will not impose administrative sanctions."
  It took fourteen months, after repeated follow-ups and criticisms, to send such a perfunctory reply letter, which is really unsatisfactory. The relevant personnel of the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee and the Fuyang Commissioner's Office are obviously irresponsible and unserious in handling this people's letter. Therefore, we wrote to the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, criticizing the above facts, and requesting him to be responsible for checking and replying to this newspaper regarding the entire handling process of this letter. After receiving the criticism from this newspaper, Comrade Ren Songyun, Secretary of the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee, convened several comrades in charge of handling people's letters, as well as several members of the Prefectural Committee in the agency, the Prefectural Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee, and comrades from the Commissioner's Office of People's Supervision Department, and held four meetings to comprehensively examine the fact that the number of people's letters received by the Prefectural Committee-level agencies had decreased significantly in the past year.
    In order to learn from the lessons, the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee stated in its inspection and self-criticism report that in handling people's letters in the future, it will resolutely adhere to the following points:
    1.  Use the handling of the above-mentioned letter as a lesson, launch discussions from top to bottom, and combine this with reviewing the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals," and conduct criticism and self-criticism in connection with reality, so that staff, especially responsible comrades at all levels and in all units, fully recognize the importance of caring about and listening to the opinions of the people, and clarify that this is the unshirkable responsibility of every public servant; resolutely correct the erroneous attitude of indifference, procrastination, carelessness, and perfunctory treatment of people's letters and visits.
    2.  Strictly stipulate that responsible comrades at all levels personally check the work system for handling people's letters and receiving people's visits on a regular basis, and stipulate that existing accumulated cases should be properly handled before the end of November.
    3.  In order to ensure the regularity of this work, each unit should designate a special person to handle people's letters. The person responsible for this work should have a strong mass perspective, a certain level of policy understanding, and be able to adhere to the truth. At the same time, an effective system of registration, processing, transfer, inspection, follow-up, and regular summarization should be established.
    4.  The Prefectural Committee stipulates that a special person is responsible for this work, and regularly studies and checks this work. It is tentatively scheduled to summarize once a month, and check, discuss, and summarize once a quarter, and requires the County Committees of each county to implement this accordingly.
    The CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee's spirit of improving its work in response to its shortcomings is good, and some of the specific measures taken by the Prefectural Committee in handling people's letters are also correct. The implementation of these regulations will ensure that the connection between the Party and the people is further strengthened.

    It should be pointed out that delayed, perfunctory, formalistic, and unresolved reply letters, and even the long-term disregard of reader letters and repeated follow-up criticism letters from newspapers, are not uncommon. We have some examples of this at hand:
    On May 23, 1953, this newspaper forwarded a reader's letter to the former CPC Fuxian County Committee of Liaodong, reflecting the problem of the Deputy Manager of the county's Coal Construction Company suppressing criticism. This letter was followed up ten times over a period of one year and five months, and no reply has ever been received. There is no need to criticize the bureaucracy of this agency, because they have already lost the basic responsibility of handling people's letters. Otherwise, why is there not a single word of reply?
    On October 17, 1953, this newspaper forwarded a reader's letter to the CPC Xinyang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province (reporting the illegal and undisciplined behavior of the Deputy County Magistrate of Zhengyang County). After six follow-ups over the past year, although corresponding reply letters have been received, how did they reply? They were just using boilerplate phrases like "Not yet verified," "Under investigation," or "Pending study" to "go through the motions."
    On July 21, 1953, this newspaper forwarded a letter to the General Office of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC (accusing Gao Yanxian, Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Commerce, of bureaucracy and suppressing criticism). After five follow-ups over a year and three months, a reply letter was finally sent recently. The reply letter was like this:
      "There are some discrepancies in the severity of the facts reflected by the reader, but in order to educate cadres and improve work, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Supervision Commission decided:
      Gao Yanxian will make a self-criticism at a meeting of section-level cadres in each company under the Department of Commerce.
      This case has also been dealt with."
    What exactly are the discrepancies in the facts reflected by the reader? How did the person being criticized make a self-criticism? And what kind of treatment was given? These are all things that need to be known when handling reader letters, but this reply letter, stamped with the official seal of the agency, did not explain clearly.
    We ask the responsible comrades of the above-mentioned units to check their mass work. At the same time, we hope that all places where mass work is weak will quickly formulate measures to strengthen the handling of people's letters.

### 向不负责处理来信的现象作斗争

    向不负责处理来信的现象作斗争
    一九五三年五月四日，本报转给中共安徽阜阳地方委员会（以下简称地委会）一封读者来信（揭发阜阳专区煤建公司秘书股长官僚主义、打击报复的问题），请地委会调查处理，并将处理情况和结果答复本报。这封信经过八次催办，没有得到地委会的任何答复。一九五四年七月十日，忽然阜阳专署人民监察处就上述问题寄来一个这样的复信：
      “人民日报社：你社于一九五三年转给阜阳地委会关于杨在银检举煤建公司秘书股长官僚主义及打击报复一案，现已经专署工商科了解处理。
    该案延迟到现在的主要原因，是被检举人及有关人员已调工作，其中打击报复的问题难作结论，因此到现在才结案。关于该公司秘书股长冯彬远在工作中官僚主义及其恋爱问题，因冯已作书面检讨，领导上认为检讨较深刻，不予行政处分。”
  拖延了十四个月，经过屡次催办和批评，才寄来一封如此草率的答复信，实在是难以令人满意。中共阜阳地委会和阜阳专署的有关人员，在处理这封人民来信的工作上显然是不负责、不严肃的。为此，我们写信给地委会书记，批评了上述事实，要求他负责检查并答复本报关于这封信件的全部处理经过。中共阜阳地委会书记任松筠同志接到本报的批评后，召集了负责处理人民来信的几位同志，和在机关的几位地委委员、地委纪律检查委员会、专署人民监察处等部门的同志举行了四次会议，全面地检查了最近一年来地委一级机关收到人民来信大量减少的事实。
    为了接受教训，中共阜阳地委会在检查和检讨报告中表示，今后在处理人民来信工作中，要坚决做到如下几点：
    一、要用上述信件的处理为教训，自上而下地展开讨论，并结合温习中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”，联系实际开展批评和自我批评，使工作人员特别是各级和各单位的负责同志充分认识到关心和听取人民群众意见的重要，并明确这是每个人民勤务员义不容辞的职责；坚决纠正对群众来信、来访工作漠不关心、拖拉、马虎、敷衍塞责的错误态度。
    二、严格规定各级负责同志亲自动手，定期检查处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作制度，并规定把现有的积案在十一月底以前妥善地处理完毕。
    三、为了保证这一工作的经常化，各单位确定专人处理人民来信，担任这项工作的人，应有坚强的群众观点，一定的政策水平，并能坚持真理，同时，要建立有效的登记、处理、转办、检查、催办和定期总结的制度。
    四、地委会规定专人分管此项工作，并定期研究检查这项工作，暂定每月小结一次，每季检查讨论总结一次，并要求各县县委会也按此执行。
    中共阜阳地委会这种针对工作缺点改进工作的精神是好的，地委对处理人民来信工作的一些具体措施也是正确的。这些规定的贯彻执行，将会保证党和人民群众的联系进一步的密切。

    应该指出，拖延、草率、形式主义、不解决问题的答复信，甚至对读者信件和报社再三再四催办的批评信件长期置之不理，并不是罕见的事情。在我们手头就有这样的一些例子：
    一九五三年五月二十三日，本报转给前中共辽东复县委员会一件读者来信，反映该县煤建公司副经理压制批评的问题。这封信经过一年零五个月的十次催办，始终没有寄来任何答复。用不着批评这个机关的官僚主义，因为他们已经丧失了处理人民来信的起码的责任。否则，为什么没有只字片语的答复呢？
    一九五三年十月十七日，本报转给中共河南信阳地方委员会一封读者来信（检举正阳县副县长违法乱纪事），经过一年来的六次催办，虽然收到了相应的答复信，但他们是怎样答复的呢？不是“尚未查明”，就是“正在调查”或“尚待研究”的一些“应付公事”的套语。
    一九五三年七月二十一日本报转给中共新疆分局办公厅一封信（控告新疆省商业厅副厅长高燕先官僚主义、压制批评），经过一年又三个月的五次催办，最近才算寄来一封答复信，复信是这样的：
      “读者反映事实的情节轻重有些出入，但为了教育干部、改进工作，新疆省人民监察委员会决定：
      由高燕先在商业厅所属各公司股长级干部会议上作检讨。
      此案亦作了处理。”
    到底读者所反映事实有哪些出入呢？被批评者怎样检讨的？又作了怎样的处理？这些都是在处理读者信件时所需要知道的事情，但，这封盖着机关公章的复信，却没有交代清楚。
    我们要求上述单位的负责同志要检查一下自己的群众工作，同时，希望一切群众工作薄弱的地方，迅速作出加强处理人民来信工作的措施。
