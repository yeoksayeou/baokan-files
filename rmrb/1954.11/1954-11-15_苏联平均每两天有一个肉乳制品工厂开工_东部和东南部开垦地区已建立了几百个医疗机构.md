The amount of meat processed in the first ten months of this year alone was 138 million kilograms more than in the same period last year. In addition, the production of Soviet semi-finished meat products has also greatly increased. Soviet housewives can buy approximately 50 percent more semi-finished products such as chicken, duck, turkey, and goose from food enterprises in various regions than last year. To adapt to the development of meat and dairy product production, the Soviet Union has built more than 30 cold storage facilities equipped with the latest equipment this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to a TASS report: With the vigorous development of reclamation work, the reclaimed areas in the eastern and southeastern Soviet Union have established 130 hospitals and 233 maternity stations. 470 doctors in various specialties and 1,710 secondary medical personnel have gone to work in these areas. The medical institutions in the reclaimed areas are equipped with a large number of medical devices, instruments, mobile clinics, and surgical equipment. Recently, the Kazakh Ministry of Health also transported three sets of mobile X-ray equipment, eight mobile power stations, and laboratories to the reclaimed areas.
    Experts from many Soviet health and medical institutions recently spent several months visiting the main reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan and the Altai Krai, conducting thorough investigations and research into the working and living conditions of the local people. Based on the results of the investigation and research, they have formulated a plan to organize medical services in the reclaimed areas and assist local health and medical institutions in their work. While conducting investigations and research, scientists also participated in consultations on difficult and complex diseases in local medical institutions and used the latest diagnostic and treatment methods. In addition, they gave many public lectures on health and medical issues.
    The Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences attaches great importance to the scientific research and practical activities of scientists in the reclaimed areas. It has now been decided to further organize scientific research and medical service work in the reclaimed areas.

    苏联平均每两天有一个肉乳制品工厂开工
    东部和东南部开垦地区已建立了几百个医疗机构
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：自今年年初以来，苏联已有约一百五十个新建的肉品、香肠、罐头、牛油、干酪等工厂投入生产，平均每两天就有一个肉乳制品工业企业开工。
    今年年初以来苏联肉乳制品工业比去年同期多生产了价值约二十四亿卢布的产品。单是今年头十个月加工的肉类就比去年同期多一亿三千八百万公斤。此外，苏联肉类半制成品的生产也大大增加了，苏联的家庭主妇可以从各地的食品企业中买到比去年约多百分之五十的鸡肉、鸭肉、火鸡肉和鹅肉等的半制成品。为了适应肉乳制品生产的发展，苏联今年已建造了三十多个装有最新式设备的冷藏库。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：随着开垦工作的蓬勃发展，苏联东部和东南部开垦地区已经建立了一百三十所医院和二百三十三个接生站，到这些地区工作的已有四百七十名各科医生和一千七百一十名中等医务工作人员。开垦地区的医疗机构都拥有大量的医疗器械、仪器、诊疗车和手术设备。最近哈萨克卫生部还运送了三套流动的爱克斯光设备、八个流动的发电站和化验室到开垦地区去。
    苏联许多卫生医疗机构的专家最近用了几个月的时间访问了主要开垦地区哈萨克和阿尔泰边疆区，对当地人民的工作和生活条件进行了彻底的调查研究工作。他们已根据调查研究的结果制订了一项在开垦地区组织医疗服务和帮助当地卫生及医疗机构进行工作的计划。科学家们在进行调查研究的同时，还参加了当地医疗机构对疑难病症的会诊，并使用了最新的诊断和医疗方法。此外，他们还作了许多次有关卫生医疗问题的公开讲演。
    苏联医学科学院十分重视科学家们在开垦地区的科学研究工作和实际活动。现已决定在开垦地区进一步组织科学研究和医疗服务工作。
