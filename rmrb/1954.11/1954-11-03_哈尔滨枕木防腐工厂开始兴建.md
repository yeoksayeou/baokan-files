The Harbin Sleeper Preservation Plant, a large-scale, modern sleeper preservation plant, has begun construction. Once completed, this sleeper preservation plant will be able to produce 1.6 million preserved sleepers annually, which will greatly contribute to the development of China's railway transportation. The service life of these preserved sleepers is three to four times longer than that of ordinary sleepers. Once this plant begins production, it will save the country approximately 450 billion yuan annually. The Harbin Sleeper Preservation Plant is designed according to advanced Soviet standards.

    哈尔滨枕木防腐工厂开始兴建
    一座规模巨大的现代化枕木防腐工厂——哈尔滨枕木防腐工厂已经开始兴建。这座枕木防腐工厂建成后，每年可以生产一百六十万根防腐枕木，对于发展我国的铁路运输事业有很大作用。这种防腐枕木的使用年限，比普通枕木长三、四倍。这座工厂开始生产后，每年约可给国家节省四千五百亿元的财富。哈尔滨枕木防腐工厂是按照苏联先进标准设计的。
