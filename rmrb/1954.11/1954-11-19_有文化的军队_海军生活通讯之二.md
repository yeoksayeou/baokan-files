    A Cultured Army
    ——Naval Life Correspondence II
    By Our Reporter Chen Yongjin

    At night, the sea calms down, and the deck of the warship also quiets down. Except for the sailors on watch, everything seems to be asleep.

    About an hour after the watch bell rings, Deputy Captain Chen Renshan asks me to take a look at the crew quarters together.

    We gently climb down the ladder into the crew quarters. The lights in the crew quarters are fitted with red and black cloth covers, emitting a faint glow.

    Some sailors are asleep amidst the whirring sound of the ventilators. Those sailors whose bunks are far from the lights and who are not asleep, some put their heads, some put their feet on the mouths of the ventilators, comfortably caressing their bodies, staring with their eyes, resting, and thinking about something. Those close to the lights are reading, writing diaries, writing poems, writing manuscripts, or practicing calligraphy. Every time the deputy captain walks to the sailors who are already asleep but without blankets, he carefully covers them. Every time he walks to the bunks of the sailors who are studying, he gently calls out to them: Comrades, get some rest early. Those who are studying close their books, or put down their pens, some even smile and say: Can’t sleep! When we walk to a crew quarters on the foredeck, on the third tier of bunks in the right corner of the crew quarters, under a lamp, lies a dark-skinned young man, lying on his side, reading "Water Margin." The deputy captain stands beside him for a long time, but he still doesn't notice, and continues to read. It wasn't until Chen Renshan patted him a second time that he turned around, smiled, and closed the book. This is how I first met the sailor Lin Baoguo. Lin Baoguo is very articulate, he says: "I have a lucky spot; the light is installed above my bunk. This increases my study time." Lin Baoguo's language proficiency has reached the middle school level; his mathematics has reached algebra. However, sailors with Lin Baoguo's level of education are just very ordinary sailors. The sailors' enthusiasm for learning is like hungry cattle rushing into a vegetable garden. Take this ordinary sailor Lin Baoguo as an example, he was a native-born child before joining the army. When he was young, he dreamed of going to elementary school to study, but he couldn't go to school because his family was poor. In the past, whenever he saw someone holding a thick book, he always thought: When will I ever finish reading it! Now he doesn't feel that reading a big book is long at all. In the past, when he was at home, he used to draw on the ground with a small stick to learn to write. Now he has two fountain pens and a large pile of hardcover notebooks, which he can use to write to his heart's content. Lin Baoguo tells me that he doesn't study well, some comrades have already studied trigonometry and geometry. Without culture, one cannot master modern military technology.

    In the crew quarters, each sailor has a small locker. From these small lockers, you can discover the sailors' interest in cultural learning. These sailors' small lockers rarely contain clothes and are mostly filled with books. I visit Chen Xuefeng's small locker, which is next to Lin Baoguo's. There are more than fifty books inside. There are "How to Be a Communist Party Member" and "How to Be a Communist Youth League Member," as well as several books by Chairman Mao and more than a dozen literary books. In addition, there are eight hardcover notebooks. Chen Xuefeng completed the junior high school mathematics course and the high school language course last year. He can write beautiful calligraphy, he writes a diary, and he also loves to write poetry. But he, too, was a native-born child in the past. In those years of hunger, he joined the Kuomintang Navy from his hometown of Fujian. In the Kuomintang Navy, there was no mood to study culture, and one could never get a smile all day long, and it felt dirty as soon as one opened one's eyes. Chen Xuefeng later revolted together with Chen Renshan. After the uprising, Chen Xuefeng also had a short period of doubt. Later, when he fell ill, the political commissar personally went to visit him, and the old soldiers from the army brought him bedpans and chamber pots. He was so moved that he was about to cry. He experienced the feelings of comrades for the first time. But his understanding of the activities of the party branch was still very unclear. Later, the branch invited him to attend a党员大会 (Party Member's Congress) as a non-voting member. At this congress, a soldier questioned the instructor why he was unwilling to attend morning exercises. The instructor admitted his mistake on the spot, and the next day the instructor ran to the playground early. From then on, he gradually gained an understanding of the Party, and he did whatever the Party called for. Especially during the cultural great leap forward, he realized the higher-level instruction that "without a certain level of culture, one cannot quickly master modern weapons, and therefore cannot be a good sailor." Chen Xuefeng's cultural level is improving rapidly. In 1950, he wrote a letter to his long-separated parents for the first time with his own pen. In the letter, he said that the Communist Party had brightened his eyes.

    During my days on the warship, I saw this young man, who worked honestly but didn't like to talk, every day. Later, he allowed me to read his diary and a poem "I Stand Guard on the Ocean." Chen Xuefeng's poems are not only full of a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, but also very beautiful in language. He wrote: "The summer sun makes me sweat profusely, and the winter wind freezes my clothes. I hold my gun tightly to guard our vast coast, letting ships and fishing boats pass by my side. The smiling sailors tell me: they are fully loaded with freshly caught fish, fully loaded with steel bars and iron plates. Hurry up! My ships and fishing boats, don't delay for even a second. Please say hello to the beautiful cities of the motherland, please say hello to the bountiful fields of the motherland. I stand guard on the ocean of the motherland, my heart is closely linked with the hearts of 600 million people, I will never feel lonely, I will never feel alone."

    As long as a cultural worker comes to this warship, he will immediately encounter sailors discussing poetry with him. On this warship, I read nearly a hundred poems by the sailors, all of which were as full of passionate emotions as Chen Xuefeng's poems.

    The sailors here are not only good at writing poetry, but also good at composing music and singing! Many of the tunes sung in the fleet now are composed by the sailors themselves.

    有文化的军队
    ——海军生活通讯之二
    本报记者　陈勇进
    夜里，海面上平静下来，军舰的甲板上也平静下来，除了值更的水兵以外，一切好像都睡熟了。
    大约在敲过更钟一个钟头以后，陈仁珊副舰长约我一同去兵舱里看看。
    我们轻轻地从梯子上爬到兵舱里去。兵舱里的电灯戴上了用红布和黑布做的灯套，放射出微弱的光。
    水兵们有的在通风机呼隆呼隆的声音里睡着了。那床铺离电灯远的又没有睡着的水兵，有的把脑袋、有的把脚放在通风机的口口上，舒适地抚摩着身子，瞪着眼睛，在休息，在想什么。那离电灯近的同志，有的在读书，有的在写日记、写诗、写稿，也有的在练习钢笔字。副舰长每走到那已经睡熟但又没盖被单的水兵那里，就小心翼翼地给水兵们盖好。每走到那正在学习的水兵床铺的时候，就轻轻地喊他们：同志，早点休息吧。那些学习的水兵把书本合上，或把笔放下，有的还笑着说：睡不着呀！当我们走到前甲板上一个兵舱的时候，兵舱右角的一盏电灯下的第三层吊铺上，躺着一个皮肤黝黑的小伙子，他侧身向里，在看“水浒”。副舰长在他的身边站了好久，他还是没有发觉，后来陈仁珊副舰长轻轻地用手拍了拍他，他仍然不动地继续看下去。待陈仁珊第二次拍他的时候，他才回过头来笑了笑把书合上了。这就是我最早认得的水兵林保国。林保国很会说话，他说：“我有个福门头，电灯安在我的床头上了。这样就增加了我的学习时间。”林保国在语文程度上，已经达到了中学水平了；数学已经学到了代数。但是，像林保国这样文化程度的水兵，也仅仅是十分普通的水兵。水兵们的学习情绪，像饥饿的牛儿跑进菜园一样。拿这个普通的水兵林保国来说吧，他未参军前是个土生土长的孩子，他小的时候，曾经梦想着到小学里去念念书，因为家里穷进不了学校。过去他看谁拿着一厚本书，总想着：啥时候才能看完呀！现在他读起那大本头书，一点也不觉得长了。过去在家的时候，他拿着小棍整天在地皮上划着学写字。现在他有两枝钢笔，还有一大堆精装的小本本，可以尽情地写。林保国对我说，他学习得不算好，有的同志已学到三角几何了。没有文化就不能掌握现代化的军事技术。
    在兵舱里，水兵们每人都有个小柜橱。你从这个小柜橱里面可以发觉水兵们对文化学习的兴趣。这些水兵的小柜橱里，很少是衣物而多是书籍。我参观了和林保国紧靠在一块的陈学锋的小柜橱。这里面有五十多本书。有“怎样做一个共产党员”和“怎样做一个青年团员”，还有毛主席的几本著作和十多本文艺书籍。此外还有八个精装的笔记本。陈学锋去年就学完了初级中学的数学课、高中的语文课。他能写一笔漂亮的钢笔字，他写日记，也爱写诗。可是，过去他也是个土生土长的孩子。他在那饥饿的年月里，从他的家乡福建参加了国民党海军。他在国民党的海军里，那里有心情学文化，整天价得不着个笑脸，真是睁开眼睛就觉得肮脏。陈学锋后来和陈仁珊一块儿起义了。起义后，陈学锋也有过一个短时期的疑虑，后来他病了，政委还亲自去问候他，从陆军里来的老战士给他拿尿盆拿屎盆，他那时感动得要哭出来。他第一次体会到同志的情感。但他对党支部的活动认识还很不清楚。后来，支部请他列席参加了一次党员大会，在这次党员大会上，一个战士质问指导员为什么不愿上早操。指导员当场承认了错误，第二天指导员果然老早就跑到操场上去了。从那时起，他对党逐渐有了认识，党号召什么他就干什么。特别是在文化大进军的时候，他认识了上级指示的“没有一定的文化水平，就不能迅速地掌握现代化的武器，因此也就不能做一个好的水兵。”陈学锋的文化水平在飞速地提高着，一九五○年他第一次自己拿着笔给他久别的父母写了封信，他在信上说，共产党使他的眼睛明亮了。
    我留在军舰的日子里，天天看见这个老实工作而不爱讲话的青年。后来他允许我阅读他的日记和一首“我在海洋上站岗”的诗。陈学锋的诗里不仅充满着高度的爱国热忱，语言也是非常美丽的。他这样写道：“夏天的太阳晒得我汗水淋淋，冬天的寒风冻结了我的衣衫。我紧握着枪守卫着我们辽阔的海岸，让轮船和渔船通过我的身边。那向我微笑的海员告诉我：他们满载着刚出海的鱼儿，满载着钢筋和铁板。快些飞奔呀！我的轮船和渔船，可别耽误一分一秒的时间。请给我问好祖国美丽的城市，请给我问好祖国丰收的田园。我在祖国的海洋上站岗，我的心和六万万颗心紧紧相联，我永远不会感到寂寞，我永远感不到孤单。”
    只要是一个文化工作者来到这艘军舰上，他马上会碰到水兵和他讨论诗的问题。我在这艘军舰上，读了水兵们的近百首诗，这些诗都像陈学锋的诗那样充满着热烈的情感。
    这里的水兵们，不但好写诗，还好作曲唱歌哩！现在舰队里唱的曲子，很多是水兵们自己编的。
