Cotton stalk outer skin fiber can be used as a raw material for making sacks after being soaked and washed. The state-owned Zhejiang Jute Textile Factory recently used cotton stalk skin fiber mixed with jute to weave sacks. After a comprehensive economic and technical appraisal, it has been proven that this kind of sack is as durable as sacks woven from pure jute, and the quality meets the standards stipulated by the state. The factory has decided to start mass production of sacks made from cotton stalk skin fiber and jute blend next year, and has decided to purchase cotton stalk skin first in the cotton-producing areas of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.

In the past, cotton stalks were used as firewood. If the outer skin of the new cotton stalks is peeled off, the fiber obtained from washing and peeling the cotton stalks produced in East China, North China, and Central South China alone would be enough to supply seven jute textile factories as large as the Zhejiang Jute Textile Factory for one year.

    棉花秆的纤维可做麻袋
    新收割的棉花秆的外皮经过淹洗以后，它的纤维可以做制造麻袋的原料。国营浙江麻纺织厂最近利用棉秆皮纤维同黄麻混合纺织出麻袋，经过全面的经济和技术鉴定，已证明这种麻袋和纯黄麻织的麻袋一样耐用，质量符合国家规定的标准。这个厂决定从明年开始大批生产用棉秆皮纤维和黄麻混纺的麻袋，并决定先在浙江省和江苏省的产棉区收购棉秆皮。
    棉花秆过去都是作柴烧，如果剥取新棉秆的外皮，单是华东、华北、中南三个地区一年所产棉花秆剥洗以后所得的纤维，足够供给像浙江麻纺织厂那样大的七个麻纺织厂一年之用。　（据新华社讯）
