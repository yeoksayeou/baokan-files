The Kangzang Highway has crossed the last great mountain on the way to Lhasa - Sejila Mountain. At noon on November 10th, cars drove to the western foot of Sejila Mountain amidst cheers. Counting from the eastern foot of the mountain, the length of the highway open to traffic has extended by another thirty kilometers. Now, the distance between the eastern and western sections of the Kangzang Highway is only seventy kilometers. The vast road construction teams are all converging on this new section of the road. Construction has already begun in some areas.

Sejila Mountain lies across the northern bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the Gongbu area, with an elevation of more than 4,400 meters above sea level. Snow and ice began to form on the mountain in September. Road construction soldiers and workers continued to display their spirit of hard work and perseverance, and fully utilized their high-altitude operation experience from the past few years to open up this great mountain. The entire project was completed five days ahead of schedule.

Road construction personnel felled tens of thousands of trees in the primeval forests on the hillside. Soldiers working on the mountaintop worked day and night in the snow, splitting open dozens of meters of high cliffs ahead of schedule. During construction, they also encountered several kilometers of muddy grassland. Road construction soldiers and workers removed the turf, dug out one or two meters of thin mud, filled it with stones, and then paved a wooden raft subgrade with tree trunks. When building the subgrade of a section of muddy land on the western foot of the mountain, on snowy mornings or windy evenings, the road construction soldiers, regardless of the cold, applied anti-freeze ointment on their legs and went down into the thin, icy swamp to work.

All road construction personnel demonstrated a high degree of initiative in the work of opening up this great mountain. Health personnel tried every means to prevent and treat diseases and frostbite. Cooks dug cellars and built warm sheds on the mountain to sprout soybeans and grind tofu, ensuring that meals were prepared well. Drivers responsible for on-site transportation drove day and night on the newly opened subgrade. The Tibetan people in the Gongbu area actively organized animal power to support road construction. Various transport teams busily traveled back and forth on the mountain, transporting large quantities of materials and equipment to the construction site in a timely manner. (Xinhua News Agency)

    康藏公路跨过最后一座大山——色齐拉山
    康藏公路已跨过了西通拉萨的最后一座大山——色齐拉山。十一月十日中午，汽车在人们的欢呼中开到色齐拉山的西边山脚。从山东麓算起，公路通车里程又前伸了三十公里。现在，康藏公路东段和西段间的距离只有七十公里了，浩大的筑路队伍，正全部向这段新线路上集结。有的地区已经开工。
    色齐拉山横互在工布地区雅鲁藏布江北岸，拔海四千四百多公尺，九月间，山上就开始落雪结冰。筑路战士和工人们继续发挥艰苦顽强的战斗精神，并充分运用了几年来的高山作业经验，打通了这座大山，全部工程提前五天完成。
    筑路人员在山坡上的原始森林里，伐掘了几万株树木，在山顶施工的战士们，冒雪昼夜工作，提前劈开了几十公尺高的石崖。在施工中，还遇到几公里的泥沼草地，筑路战士和工人们掀掉草皮，挖除了一、两公尺深的稀泥，填上石头，然后用树干铺好了木排路基。在修筑山西麓的一段泥沼地的路基时，在落雪的清早或刮大风的傍晚，筑路战士们不顾寒冷，在腿上涂上防冻油膏，下到结了薄冰的泥沼里工作。
    全体筑路工作人员在修通这座大山的工作中，都发挥了高度的积极性，卫生人员们想尽各种办法防治疾病和冻伤，炊事员们在山上挖地窖、修暖棚，生豆芽、磨豆腐，保证作好饭菜。负责工地运输的驾驶员们，日夜在新开出的路基上行驶。工布地区的藏族人民积极组织畜力支援筑路，各个运输队紧张地往返在山上山下，把大量物资和料具及时运送到工地。　（新华社）
