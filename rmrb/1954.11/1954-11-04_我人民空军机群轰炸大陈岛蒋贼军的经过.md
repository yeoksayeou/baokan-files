Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 3rd. Our frontline reporter reports: One day in the morning, People's Air Force aircraft formations bombed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on Dachen Island and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit naval vessels anchored near Dachen Island, wave after wave.

	The reporter interviewed a flight group that had just returned victoriously from a combat mission. The combat mission of this flight group was to attack the positions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on the island. When this flight group skimmed over the calm sea and suddenly appeared over Dachen Island, which was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit naval vessels and ground anti-aircraft guns fired in panic. However, the pilots had clearly seen the positions, bunkers, and barracks of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on the island, which were their intended targets.

	This flight group crossed the anti-aircraft fire in batches and bravely swooped down on the two positions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops from low altitude. Wang Yu-feng and Wang En-pu, the leaders of the two lead aircraft, issued bombing orders almost simultaneously. As the pilots pressed the buttons, a large number of bombs poured straight down to the ground, exploding continuously and violently, and the positions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were immediately engulfed in a thick cloud of smoke. Then, another military target under attack—an anti-aircraft gun position of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops that was firing—was immediately silenced by the destructive bombing of this flight group. When this flight group completed its mission and returned, another fraternal flight group immediately flew over Dachen Island and launched a similarly fierce attack on other positions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.

	When this flight group landed safely at the airport, the ground crew rushed to the planes. They enthusiastically helped the pilots out of the cockpits and competed to shake hands warmly with these young air force warriors. The photos taken by the leader's plane clearly showed that in the bombed target area, many barracks of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were left with only broken walls, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were running away in all directions in a smoke-filled courtyard.

    我人民空军机群轰炸大陈岛蒋贼军的经过
    【新华社浙江前线三日电】本社浙江前线记者报道：一日上午，浙江前线我人民空军某部队的机群一批接着一批地轰炸大陈岛上的蒋贼军和停泊在大陈岛附近海面上的蒋贼舰艇。
    记者访问了一个刚刚执行过战斗任务胜利飞回的机群。这个机群的战斗任务是攻击这个岛上的蒋贼军的阵地。当这个机群掠过平静的海面，突然出现在蒋贼军盘踞的大陈岛上空时，蒋贼军舰艇和地面上的高射炮惊慌地射击起来。但是飞行员们已经清楚地看到了岛上蒋贼军的阵地、地堡和营房，这些都是他们预定的攻击目标。
    这个机群分批越过高射炮火，勇猛地从低空掠向蒋贼军的两个阵地。两架领队飞机上的王玉峰和王恩普几乎在同一时间发出了投弹的命令。飞行员们一按电钮，大批炸弹就直向地面泻去，连续猛烈地爆炸开来，蒋贼军阵地立即被一片浓烈的烟雾吞没。接着，被攻击的另一个军事目标——正在射击着的一个蒋贼军的高射炮阵地，也在这个机群的摧毁性的轰炸下立刻沉默了。这个机群完成任务返航时，另一个兄弟机群紧接着飞到了大陈岛的上空，对蒋贼军其它阵地进行同样猛烈的攻击。
    当这一个机群在机场安全着落时，地勤人员都向飞机奔去，他们热情地将飞行员接出座舱，并争着和这一批年青的空军勇士们热烈握手。领队长机所拍的照片上，清楚地显示出，在轰炸过的目标区，蒋贼军的许多营房只剩下了残破的半壁，蒋贼军在硝烟弥漫的一个院里四散奔逃。
