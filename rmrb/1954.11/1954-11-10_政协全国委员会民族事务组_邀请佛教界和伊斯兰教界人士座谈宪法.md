    CPPCC National Committee Ethnic Affairs Group
    Invites Buddhist and Islamic Figures to Discuss the Constitution
    The Ethnic Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) invited figures from the Buddhist and Islamic communities to hold discussions on the Constitution on the 4th and 5th of this month, respectively. Participants in the symposium included CPPCC National Committee members Li Shucheng, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Qiyou, and Ma Jian. Buddhist figures included Xirao Gyatso, Zhao Puchu, and the Tibetan lamas who came to Beijing, including Lincang Living Buddha, Karmapa Living Buddha, Ngawang Jinpa, and Tuden Cuicheng. Islamic figures included Da Powsheng, Ma Zhenwu, Ma Songting, and imams from various mosques in Beijing, totaling over a hundred people.
    The symposium was presided over by Zhu Zaoguan, head of the CPPCC National Committee Ethnic Affairs Group, and Gan Chunlei, the deputy head.
    During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the provisions in the Constitution regarding ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief further inspired the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic minorities and religious circles in our country to build the motherland. Lincang Living Buddha said: Our motherland is now a united, unified, prosperous and strong country. The people of all our ethnic minorities are living a peaceful and happy life, and our freedom of religious belief is guaranteed. This is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership. Ngawang Jinpa said: We must better study and publicize the Constitution, and at the same time, we must further strengthen national unity, consolidate national defense, and safeguard national security. The imams of various mosques in Beijing also spoke freely about their study of ethnic and religious policies. (Xinhua News Agency)
