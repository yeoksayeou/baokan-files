Jiangxi Province and Beijing Municipality to Each Build a New State-Owned Farm

    Jiangxi Province is preparing to build a state-owned mechanized Lefeng Farm, and the basic construction has already begun. Lefeng Farm is located on the alluvial plain of the delta formed by the eastern branch of the Xin River and the Le'an River in Poyang County, with a total area of about 100,000 mu and arable land of 50,000 to 60,000 mu. After the farm is completed, it can produce 20 to 25 million jin of grain and oil crops for the country every year. At the same time, it can also use the lakes, swamps, and hilly areas within the farm to develop animal husbandry, aquaculture, forestry, and other productions. The preparatory work for the Lefeng Farm began in March of this year. Several surveys and measurements were carried out, and relevant hydrological, climatic, and soil data were collected for planning and overall design. Three large reservoirs will also be built to solve the problems of internal waterlogging and irrigation. In mid-October, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened relevant departments to study in detail the supply problems in the construction of the farm. The Provincial Committee also instructed the Nanchang, Fuzhou, and Shangrao Prefectural Committees to dispatch laborers to support the construction of dikes to ensure that the construction project is carried out on schedule. It is estimated that the farm will be largely completed by February next year. (Our Jiangxi Reporter Station)

    The newly built Beijing State-Owned Dongjiao Farm is a diversified operation that combines agriculture and animal husbandry, with dairy cow breeding as the main focus. The farm currently has more than 4,600 mu of land and plans to raise 300 dairy cows and 50 sows, and gradually increase the number of fattening pigs. Agriculture mainly focuses on planting feed crops, followed by grains, cotton, and vegetables. In terms of planning and design, the farm learned from the advanced experience of Soviet state-owned farms. The construction of the cow house should be well-ventilated, bright, heat-resistant, and heat-insulating, meet the physiological requirements of dairy cows, and facilitate operation and management. It is also planned to establish electric wells, water towers, automatic waterers, drinking troughs, electric milking machines, milk refrigeration, medical quarantine, artificial insemination, and other equipment.

    In June of this year, the Rural Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry began to prepare for the construction of the farm. After several months of surveying, planning, and design, it was decided to build gradually year by year and gradually expand production. At present, the farm is carrying out the 1954 cow house and farm building construction project, purchasing and installing machines, establishing organizational structures, and equipping employees; at the same time, it is carrying out part of the greening work in the cow farm area and the administrative area. 176 dairy cows uniformly allocated by the Ministry of Agriculture have also been allocated to the farm. Now, all the employees of the farm are building the farm and starting agricultural and animal husbandry production. All the cultivated land has now been autumn-plowed with tractors. It is expected that the 1954 cow house and farm building construction project will be completed ahead of schedule by the end of November. The entire farm construction project is expected to be completed in 1956.

    江西省和北京市各新建一个国营农场
    江西省筹办的一所国营机械化乐丰农场，基本建设工程已开始动工。乐丰农场位于鄱阳县信河东支与乐安河三角洲的冲积平原上，场地面积总共约十万亩，可耕地有五、六万亩。农场建成后每年可为国家生产二千万至二千五百万斤的粮食和油料作物，同时还可以利用场内湖沼丘陵地带，发展畜牧、水产、林艺等生产。乐丰农场的筹建工作是从今年三月开始的，曾多次进行勘查测量，搜集了有关水文、气候土壤等资料进行规划，作出了总体设计。为了解决内部渍水和灌溉问题，还建立三个大型水库。十月中旬，中共江西省委召集各有关部门详细研究了建场中的供应问题，省委并指示南昌、抚州、上饶等地委抽调民工支援修堤，保证建场工程按时进行。估计该场在明年二月大体即可全部完成。　（本报江西记者站）
    北京市新建国营东郊农场，是一个农、牧结合以饲养乳牛为主的多样经营的农场。农场现有土地四千六百多亩，计划饲养乳牛三百头和母猪五十头，并逐年增养肥猪。农业上主要是种植饲料作物，其次是粮食、棉花、蔬菜等。农场在规划设计方面，学习了苏联国营农场先进经验。牛场房舍的建筑既要通爽明亮、抗热保温、符合乳牛生理要求，又要利于操作管理。并且还计划建立电井、水塔、自动饮水器、饮水槽、电力挤奶器、牛奶冷藏、医疗检疫、人工授精等设备。
    今年六月，中共北京市委农村工作委员会和市农林局就开始筹备建场工作。经过几个月的勘测规划设计，决定分年逐步建设，逐步扩大生产。目前，农场正在进行一九五四年度牛舍及场房建筑工程、采购并安装机器、建立组织机构和配备职工；同时进行牛场区及行政区的一部绿化工作。由农业部统一调拨的一百七十六头乳牛也拨到了农场。现在全场职工正一面建场，一面部分开始了农、牧业生产，全部耕地现已用拖拉机进行了秋耕。预计十一月底即可提前完成一九五四年度的牛舍及场房建筑工程。全部建场工作预计一九五六年完成。
