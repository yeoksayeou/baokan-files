    Recently, a brand-new blueprint for the long-term comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in Xigou Township has been hung on the wall of the Xigou Township People's Government office in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province. This blueprint indicates that this barren mountain valley will become a place of "forests of fruit trees and herds of cattle and sheep" in a few years. The living standards of the farmers will also be higher than they are now.
    This blueprint was formulated by technical cadres sent by the People's Government to Xigou Township this summer, after a long period of surveying the local area, together with the farmers. The blueprint specifically plans the areas in Xigou Township suitable for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. According to this plan, more than 18,000 mu of bare mountain slopes in the township will be closed off for afforestation, and various fruit trees, timber trees, and pasture grasses will be planted; more than 300 mu of fertile river滩 land will be created on more than 500 mu of dry river滩; various fine breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, and bees will also be bred in large numbers. The map also includes a detailed explanation of the annual increase in farmers' income with the annual development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The farmers of Xigou Township said excitedly: Our township has a total area of ​​more than 20,000 mu. In the past, we only focused on the existing cultivated land, which is less than one-tenth of the total area, leaving the remaining nine-tenths of the mountain slopes and river滩 untouched. There is so much potential in this mountain valley! In order to realize this plan to change the face of the mountainous area, the farmers decided to carry out a large-scale river滩 land creation project this winter.

    山西省平顺县西沟乡
    订出全面发展农林畜牧业的远景计划
    最近，山西省平顺县西沟乡乡人民政府办公室的墙壁上，挂起了一张西沟乡农、林、畜牧业全面发展远景规划的崭新的蓝图。这张蓝图标示：这个贫瘠的山沟若干年后将是一个“果木成林、牛羊成群”的地方。农民生活水平也将比现在提高。
    这张蓝图是今年夏季人民政府派到西沟乡的技术干部，在当地进行了长时间的勘察之后和农民们一起制订的。蓝图上分别规划了西沟乡适宜于发展农业、林业和畜牧业的区域。根据这个规划，全乡一万八千多亩光秃山坡要进行封山育林，种植各种果树、木材树和牧草；五百多亩干河滩上要淤起三百亩肥沃的河滩地；各种优良品种的牛、羊、猪、鸡和蜜蜂也要大量繁殖起来。图上还有随着每年农、林、畜牧业的发展，农民收入逐年增长的详细说明。西沟乡农民兴奋地说：咱们全乡面积总共二万多亩大，过去只在不到十分之一的现有耕地上作文章，空着十分之九的山坡和河滩不管，这山沟的文章可大哩。为着实现这个改变山区面貌的规划，农民们决定在今冬就进行大规模淤滩漫地工程。 （新华社）
