Jiangxi Province Rice Processing Plants Strive to Increase Rice Yield
    The staff and workers of the one hundred and twenty-seven rice processing plants directly under the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau have adopted methods such as the "re-screening and cleaning method" to increase the rice yield of paddy rice. Since the beginning of this year, the plants have increased rice production for the state by more than 17.7 million catties. The purity of the rice has also improved compared to the past.
    From the beginning of June last year to now, the staff and workers of these processing plants have put forward more than 390 rationalization proposals and more than 60 relatively important inventions and creations, focusing on improving the rice yield of paddy rice and the purity of rice. Among them, the "re-screening and cleaning method," which has been widely adopted by various plants, can reduce the barnyard grass content in rice by 92% without rework during processing, and can also remove all gravel. In the past, in order to eliminate the large amount of barnyard grass and gravel in rice, some of the processed rice had to be reworked once, so at least four catties would be lost from every hundred catties of rice. The rice that was lost contained a large amount of gravel and barnyard grass, and could only be used as feed or brewing material. Now, not only is this waste phenomenon avoided, but more than one million catties of barnyard grass powder can be milled from the barnyard grass removed from the rice every year for use as a non-staple food.

    江西省大米加工厂努力提高出米率
    江西省人民政府粮食厅直属的一百二十七个大米加工厂的职工们，采用“复筛净谷法”等办法，提高稻谷出米率。今年以来，各厂已为国家增产一千七百七十多万斤大米。米的纯度也比过去提高了。
    从去年六月初到现在，这些加工厂的职工们，围绕着提高稻谷的出米率和提高大米的纯度，提出三百九十多件合理化建议和六十多件比较重要的发明和创造。其中为各厂广泛采用的“复筛净谷法”，可以使稻谷在加工过程中，不用返工就能把大米中的含稗量减少百分之九十二，还能清除全部砂石。过去为了消除大米中的大量稗子和砂石，已加工好的大米有些还要返工一次，这样一百斤大米最少要被溜出四斤。溜出来的大米里面混合着大量的砂石和稗子，只能用做饲料或酿料。现在不仅避免了这种浪费现象，而且每年从大米中清除出来的稗子可碾成一百多万斤稗子粉做为副食品。
