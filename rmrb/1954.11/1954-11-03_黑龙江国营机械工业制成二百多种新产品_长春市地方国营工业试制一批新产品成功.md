The state-owned mechanical industry in Heilongjiang Province has successfully trial-produced more than two hundred kinds of new products. These include various specifications of ball bearings necessary for automobile repair shops and machine tool factories, large Soviet-style vertical milling machines and axle lathes, medium-sized water turbine generators and AC motors, DC induction motors for hydropower generation, carbon electrodes for spectroscopic analysis by mining teams, and electric meters and instruments for precision and automated machines.

Most of these new products are trial-produced according to Soviet product specifications. Many factories overcame difficulties such as insufficient technical equipment conditions during the trial production process. When Harbin Battery Factory was trial-producing carbon electrodes, it lacked equipment and materials. Through the joint research of workers and technicians for two or three months, using various tools and methods for experimentation, they finally succeeded in trial production. When Harbin Ball Bearing Factory was trial-producing small ball bearings, it lacked grinding tools. On the suggestion of Soviet experts, it switched to processing with pig iron rods. The factory also adjusted its production organization, established a special product section separately, and concentrated skilled technicians for trial production, finally completing the orders of more than one hundred factories and enterprises, and ensuring the specifications, varieties, and quality of the new products. Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory adopted a special topic meeting approach, concentrating the wisdom of technicians and workers to solve the major technical key problems in the trial production of vertical milling machines.

Through the work of trial-producing new products, the state-owned mechanical industry in Heilongjiang Province has increased the variety of products, initially opened up sales channels, and at the same time improved management and technical levels. (Xinhua News Agency)

The local state-owned industry in Changchun City has successfully trial-produced 162 new products, of which 82 have begun production according to current supply and marketing possibilities and needs.

The trial production and production of these new products will strongly cooperate with the production and construction of state-owned enterprises. Six factories, including the small hardware factory, the weights and measures factory, and the electrical equipment manufacturing factory, successfully trial-produced 49 kinds of new parts to support the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The 14-meter track scale successfully trial-produced by the Weights and Measures Factory meets the needs of railway transportation departments for measuring large wagons. The scaffolding and "brick baskets" successfully trial-produced by the woodworking production cooperative also ensure the needs of basic construction departments for mechanized construction. Many trial-produced new products are suitable for the needs of farmers. For example, the "Cure-Pig-Quick" successfully trial-produced by the veterinary drug manufacturing factory has a cure rate of 90% and is very popular among farmers.

All factories have formulated trial production plans when trial-producing new products, and have selected outstanding technical workers to form new product trial production groups. Trial production personnel from factories such as the Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory actively studied advanced Soviet technology every week when trial-producing parts for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant; the workers also studied and modified four types of equipment and created seven specialized tools. Four factories, including the Bakelite Factory and the Glass Factory, could not independently manufacture the bicycle lights required by the bicycle factory, so they jointly signed a cooperation agreement on 25 kinds of parts and jointly manufactured the bicycle lights.

Many factories pay attention to the use of waste materials to reduce product costs during the trial production and production of new products. Changchun Furniture Factory used many wood edges and corners from the lumber mill to produce wooden tables, small floors, and small dressing tables; the plywood folding chairs, plywood boxes, and asphalt particleboard products trial-produced by the plywood factory using waste materials have all been successful. These eight new products produced by these factories using waste materials are expected to increase production and save 1.5 billion yuan in wealth for the country throughout the year.

    黑龙江国营机械工业制成二百多种新产品
    长春市地方国营工业试制一批新产品成功
    黑龙江省国营机械工业已试制成功二百多种新产品。其中有汽车修配厂和机床厂等所必需的各种规格的滚珠轴承，有大型的苏联式立式铣床、车轴车床，有供水力发电用的中型水轮发电机以及交流电动机、直流感应电动机，有供采矿队作光谱分析用的碳质电极，还有供精密和自动化机器上用的电表仪器等。
    这些新产品绝大部分是按照苏联产品规格试制的。不少工厂在试制过程中，克服了技术设备条件不足的困难。哈尔滨电池厂试制碳质电极时，没有设备和资料，经工人和技术人员用两三个月时间共同研究，采用各种工具和办法试验，终于试制成功。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂试制小型滚珠轴承时，缺乏研磨工具，经苏联专家建议，改用生铁棒加工。这个厂并调整生产组织，单独成立特殊产品工段，集中熟练技工进行试制，终于完成了一百多个工厂企业的订货，并保证了新产品的规格、品种和质量。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂采取专题会议方式，集中技术人员和工人的智慧，解决了试制立式铣床时重大的技术上的关键问题。
    黑龙江省国营机械工业经过试制新产品的工作，增加了产品品种，初步打开了销路，同时提高了管理水平和技术水平。　（新华社）

    长春市地方国营工业已试制成功了一百六十二种新产品，其中有八十二种已按照当前供销的可能和需要开始生产。
    这些新产品的试制和生产将有力地配合国营企业的生产建设。小五金厂、度量衡厂和电气器材制造厂等六个工厂为支援第一汽车制造厂试制成功的各种新型零件就达四十九种。度量衡厂试制成功的十四公尺轨道衡，满足了铁路运输部门衡量大型车皮的需要。木工业生产合作社试制成功的里脚手架和“砖筐”，也保证了基本建设部门机械化施工的需要。有许多试制生产的新产品是适合于农民需要的。如兽药制造厂试制成功的“治猪灵”，治愈率达百分之九十，就很受农民欢迎。
    各工厂在试制新产品时都制订了试制计划，并抽调优秀技术工人组成新产品试制小组。电气器材制造厂等工厂试制人员在试制第一汽车制造厂的零件时，每周都积极学习苏联先进技术；工人们并研究改装了四种设备，创造了七种专门工具。电木厂、玻璃厂等四个工厂不能单独制造自行车工厂所需的自行车灯，它们就共同签订了关于二十五种部件的协作协议，协同制造了自行车灯。
    许多工厂在试制和生产新产品时，都注意利用废料，降低产品的成本。长春家具厂利用木厂的许多木边、木角生产了木台、小地板、小梳妆台等；胶合板厂利用废材试制的胶合板折椅、胶合板箱和沥青刨花板等产品都已成功。这些工厂利用废料生产的八种新产品，预计全年可为国家增产节约十五亿元的财富。　（新华社）
