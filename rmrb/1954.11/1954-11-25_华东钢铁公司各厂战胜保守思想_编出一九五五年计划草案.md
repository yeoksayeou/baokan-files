    East China Iron and Steel Company Factories Overcome Conservative Thinking
    Compile Draft Plan for 1955
   [Our Newspaper] The draft plans for 1955, including production, labor, cost, supply, major repairs, and technical organizational measures, have been compiled successively in early November by the eight factories affiliated with the East China Iron and Steel Company.
    Next year, the production level of the factories under the East China Iron and Steel Company will be further improved. The draft plan proposes that the total industrial output value will increase by 26.6% compared to the estimated completion figure for this year; the total cost of each factory will also be reduced by more than 60 billion yuan compared to this year; and the quality targets of various products will also be improved compared to this year. In order to meet the needs of national economic construction, each factory will also produce and trial-produce new products such as "shims," "channel steel," "unequal angle steel," and Soviet-style steel window materials next year.
  The factories affiliated with the East China Iron and Steel Company began preparations for compiling next year's plan in early September this year, and all indicators have been repeatedly and carefully calculated, or actual measurements have been carried out in depth in the workshops. For example, the production and scheduling work plan of the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 has been actually measured four or five times, and the labor plan of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 has been precisely calculated according to the work of each person in the labor organization and operation posts. Costs and various expenses have been thoroughly investigated and checked, overcoming many past phenomena of inappropriate apportionments or inflated costs. For example, at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, it was discovered that the wood blocks of the converter steel mold were recorded as 2.5 inches thick, but the actual thickness used was 2 inches. After verification of this item alone, the cost was reduced by more than 600 million yuan.
    When compiling next year's plan, the factories affiliated with the East China Iron and Steel Company encountered obstacles from conservative thinking. Some factory leaders emphasized the difficulties of their factory's outdated equipment and frequent accidents, and were unwilling to accept new production targets. The average advanced quota for smelting each furnace of steel in the open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 in the first half of this year was 4 hours and 58 minutes, but the target proposed by this factory for next year was 5 hours and 10 minutes. After carefully calculating the average advanced quota of each steel plant under its jurisdiction since this year, the East China Iron and Steel Company mobilized the factories to oppose conservative thinking and tap the potential of production. The manager of the East China Iron and Steel Company also went to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 to clear up thinking, and at the same time sent cadres to help the plant calculate detailed accounts and tap potential. The Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also held an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, strictly criticizing the responsible cadres with conservative thinking and correcting the incorrect thinking in the planning process. When formulating the plan, each factory also paid full attention to implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts and absorbing the advanced experience of brother factories. In this way, each factory may be able to complete more tasks next year while reducing investment costs. Now, each factory has shifted to preparations for next year's production.

### 华东钢铁公司各厂战胜保守思想  编出一九五五年计划草案

    华东钢铁公司各厂战胜保守思想
    编出一九五五年计划草案
   【本报讯】华东钢铁公司所属八个厂的一九五五年度生产、劳动、成本、供应、大修理、技术组织措施等计划草案已经在十一月初先后编好。
    明年，华东钢铁公司所属各厂的生产水平将进一步提高。计划草案中拟定：工业生产总值可比今年全年预计完成数字增长百分之二六点六；各厂的总成本也可比今年降低六百多亿元；各种产品质量计划指标比今年也都将提高，为适应国家经济建设需要，各厂明年还将生产和试制“垫板”、“槽钢”、“不等边角钢”、苏联式钢窗料等新产品。
  华东钢铁公司所属各厂从今年九月初就开始进行编制明年计划的准备工作，各项指标都经过反复和仔细的核算，或深入车间进行了实际的测定。如上海钢铁一厂转炉车间的生产和调度工作计划曾经过四、五次的实际测定，上海钢铁三厂的劳动计划按照劳动组织和操作岗位每人的工作进行了精密计算。成本和各项费用大都经过了深入调查和核对，克服了许多过去不适当的摊派或成本虚涨的现象。如在上海钢铁一厂发现转炉钢模的木块，账面上是二吋半厚，但实际用的是二吋厚的，仅这一项经过核对后，就减少成本六亿多元。
    华东钢铁公司所属各厂编制明年计划时，遇到了保守思想的阻碍。有些厂的负责干部强调本厂的设备破旧、事故多等困难，不肯接受新的生产指标。今年上半年上海钢铁一厂平炉每炉钢冶炼时间的平均先进定额是四小时五十八分，而这个厂提出的明年的指标却是五小时零十分。华东钢铁公司详细计算了所属各钢铁厂今年以来的平均先进定额以后，就动员各厂反对保守思想，挖掘生产的潜在能力。华东钢铁公司经理并到上海钢铁一厂去打通思想，同时派干部帮助一厂算细账、挖潜力。中共上海钢铁一厂委员会也召开了党委扩大会议，严格批评了有保守思想的负责干部，纠正了编制计划中的不正确的思想。各厂在订计划时并充分注意了贯彻苏联专家建议和吸取兄弟厂的先进经验。这样，各厂明年可能在减少投资费用的情况下，完成更多的任务。现在，各厂已转入明年的生产准备工作。
