    The First National Conference on Workers' Sports Concluded, Defining a Policy of Actively Leading Workers' Sports Movements

    The First National Conference on Workers' Sports concluded on the 12th. During the conference, the participating representatives successively listened to reports by Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Soviet expert Kirishev, as well as presentations on the experiences of workers' sports work from Beijing, Guangdong, Tangshan, and other provinces and cities, the China Railway Sports Association, the Benxi Sulfide Iron Mine, and the Dongguan Sugar Factory in Guangdong. They also discussed the "Provisional Outline of Measures for Carrying Out Workers' Sports Activities" (draft) and the "Main Points of the 1955 Workers' Sports Program Draft". Finally, Liu Zihui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a concluding speech.

    The conference considered that carrying out workers' sports, improving the health of workers, and enhancing their physical fitness are closely related to promoting socialist construction, the people's lives, and consolidating national defense. It is an important political task. Based on the development of workers' sports across the country, the conference determined that the current policy for workers' sports should be to actively lead and gradually develop. At present, workers' sports in general factories and mines should focus on popularization, while factories and mines with a relatively solid foundation in sports should focus on consolidation and improvement. The conference believes that the central content of the current worker's sports should be to further improve broadcast calisthenics, making it a more extensive and regular mass sports activity; at the same time, attention should also be paid to organizing various sports teams, sports groups, and exercise groups. The focus of developing workers' sports should be placed at the grassroots level.

    The conference determined that in 1955, further efforts should be made to improve the organizational construction of workers' sports. It is necessary to actively cultivate sports work cadres and activists; gradually establish organizations to lead workers' sports; and in industrial trade unions or grassroots factory and mine enterprises with the necessary conditions, workers' sports groups should be established in a prepared and gradual manner; strengthen the planning of work; and overcome the phenomena of no one being responsible and spontaneous development. Regarding the funds for carrying out workers' sports activities, the conference determined that a certain proportion could be allocated from the trade union's cultural and educational funds, and suggested that the administration allocate a certain amount from the factory director's fund as sports activity funds.

    The conference believes that carrying out workers' sports is a widespread mass work that involves all aspects. It must mobilize the masses and the relevant parties must cooperate to do a good job. Therefore, attention should be paid to propaganda and education, adopting methods of attraction and persuasion to make the broad masses of workers and all relevant parties realize the important role of carrying out workers' sports; it is necessary to go deep into the lower levels, do a good job in key areas, and drive the general; the work should also pay attention to being realistic, not only actively leading, but also not deviating from reality.

    全国第一次职工体育工作会议闭幕
    确定了积极领导职工体育运动的方针
    全国第一次职工体育工作会议，已在十二日闭幕。在会议过程中，与会代表陆续听取了中华人民共和国体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠、苏联专家凯里舍夫的报告和北京、广东、唐山等省市、中国火车头体育协会、本溪市硫化铁矿、广东东莞糖厂等单位职工体育工作的经验介绍，并讨论了“关于开展职工体育运动暂行办法纲要”（草稿）和“一九五五年职工体育运动计划要点草案”，最后由中华全国总工会书记处书记刘子久做了总结。
    会议认为，开展职工体育运动，改善职工的健康状况，增强职工的体质，对于推动社会主义建设，对于人民生活，对于巩固国防，有着密切的关系，它是一项重要政治任务。会议根据全国职工体育运动开展的情况，确定当前对职工体育运动应采取积极领导，逐步发展的方针。当前，一般厂矿企业的职工体育运动应以普及为主，在体育运动开展得较有基础的厂矿、企业可着重进行巩固与提高工作。会议认为，当前开展职工体育的中心内容是进一步搞好广播体操，使它成为更广泛、更经常的群众性体育活动；同时，也应注意组织各种运动队、运动小组、锻炼小组。至于开展职工体育运动的重点则应当放在基层。
    会议确定一九五五年应进一步做好职工体育的组织建设工作。要积极地培养体育工作干部和体育活动的积极分子；逐步建立领导职工体育运动的机构；在有条件的产业工会或基层厂矿企业单位，应有准备地、逐步地建立职工体育运动的团体；加强工作的计划性；克服无人负责和自发自流的现象。关于开展职工体育活动的经费，会议确定，可在工会文教费中按一定比例开支，并建议行政从厂长基金中拨付一定数额作为体育活动经费。
    会议认为，开展职工体育运动是具有广泛的群众性的工作，它牵涉到各个方面，必须发动群众，各有关方面共同合作，才能作好。因此，在工作中应注意进行宣传教育，采取吸引和说服的方法，使广大职工及各有关方面认识到开展职工体育运动的重要作用；必须深入下层，搞好重点，带动一般；工作中还要注意掌握实事求是，既要积极领导，又不能脱离实际而发生偏差。（新华社）
