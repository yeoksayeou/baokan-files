Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee concluded its discussion on providing technical assistance to underdeveloped countries on the 24th.

During the discussion, many representatives from economically underdeveloped countries and other speakers pointed out that the United Nations technical assistance program had achieved certain successes, but the program was not effective enough, with funds being spent on many secondary projects and excessive administrative costs.

Soviet representative Morozov said that the Soviet government was very willing to contribute to the national economic development of economically backward countries by all means, and therefore participated in the United Nations technical assistance program. On behalf of the Soviet government, Morozov announced a donation of four million rubles to the United Nations Technical Assistance Fund in 1955.

Morozov pointed out that technical assistance should help strengthen the national economies of backward countries and promote their economic and political independence. However, only 7.3 percent of the total United Nations Technical Assistance Fund was used to develop national industries.

Polish representative Bruzstan said that, as in the past few years, the Polish government remained prepared to provide the necessary financial assistance, experts, and equipment for technical assistance to backward countries.

The committee unanimously adopted a resolution calling on governments to support the United Nations technical assistance program.

    苏联宣布捐款四百万卢布作技术援助基金
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会经济及财政委员会在二十四日结束了关于对落后国家提供技术援助问题的讨论。
    许多经济落后国家的代表和其他发言的代表在讨论中都指出，联合国技术援助计划获得了一定的成就，但是这个计划不够有效，经费都花在许多次要的计划上，而且行政费用太大。
    苏联代表莫罗佐夫说，苏联政府非常愿意用一切方法对经济落后的国家的国民经济发展提供贡献，因此参加了联合国技术援助计划。莫罗佐夫代表苏联政府宣布，在一九五五年捐助四百万卢布充作联合国技术援助基金。
    莫罗佐夫指出，技术援助应当帮助加强落后国家的国民经济，并促进它们的经济和政治的独立。但是联合国技术援助基金总数中只有百分之七点三是用于发展民族工业的。
    波兰代表布鲁兹坦说，波兰政府同过去几年一样，仍然准备提供对落后国家进行技术援助所必需的经费援助、专家和设备。
    委员会一致通过了要求各国政府支持联合国技术援助计划的决议。
