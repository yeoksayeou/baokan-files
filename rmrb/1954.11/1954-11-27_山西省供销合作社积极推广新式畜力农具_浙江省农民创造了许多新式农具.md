With the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers in Shanxi Province are demanding a large supply of new-style animal-drawn farm implements. According to statistics from the Jinan, Changzhi, and Xin County Special Districts, farmers requested more than 3,100 double-wheel double-furrow plows during the autumn plowing season this year. By the end of October, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative had purchased 1,500 double-wheel double-furrow plows from farm implement factories in Northeast China, Beijing, and other places, and some of them have already been supplied to farmers. These double-wheel double-furrow plows have been warmly welcomed by farmers. Jia Chaoxi, a farmer from Beiganquan Township, Pingshun County, said: "I am over sixty years old, and I have never seen such a good plow. It plows the land deeply and evenly, and it also saves animal power and labor. It is really impossible to improve agricultural production without the help of our worker brothers!" When Laojunzhuang Village in Tunliu County was testing the double-wheel double-furrow plow, the village branch of the Chinese Communist Party publicized the prospects of national socialist industrialization to the farmers, promoting the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. Now, the farmers of this village have signed a contract with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, requesting the supply of four double-wheel double-furrow plows and a set of horse-drawn farm implements next year.

The Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a meeting of the heads of the production materials sections of the various special district offices in early November, deciding to actively promote new-style animal-drawn farm implements based on key demonstrations. The province initially plans to promote 20,000 double-wheel double-furrow plows in 1955; the supply targets are mainly state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives in economic crop areas, alkaline areas, and plain areas, and mutual aid groups with better conditions. In addition, the province also plans to supply 200 harvesters, 200 ten-row seeders, 220 five-row seeders, more than 1,300 cultivators, 10,000 new-style walking plows, 5,500 waterwheels, and a batch of rice threshers and grain threshers in 1955. In order to promptly pass on the technology of using new-style animal-drawn farm implements to the broad masses of farmers, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the various special districts have already trained a group of technical cadres in October; many counties also plan to train a group of blacksmiths, carpenters, senior primary school graduates, and technicians from agricultural production cooperatives during the slack farming season.

Farmers in Zhejiang Province have created many new-style farm implements. According to statistics from the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Administration, in the past four and a half months, localities have reported 85 farm implements created by farmers, and even more have been reported to the various special commissioner's offices and county people's governments. These farm implements are mostly created according to the production characteristics of various regions. For example, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou are areas with dense water networks, and waterwheels are very useful. Farmers have added ball bearing plates to the waterwheels, thereby reducing resistance and greatly improving efficiency. In the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang, a large amount of coarse grains are produced, and farmers have created sweet potato shredding machines and corn threshing machines, increasing efficiency by three to four times. In addition, flax peeling machines, sowing machines (mainly for sowing wheat and cotton), harrowing machines, rapeseed threshing machines, as well as animal-powered rice transplanters, and diesel engine-powered double-row dragon bone waterwheels for pumping water have also been created. The use of these new-style farm implements can not only improve efficiency compared to the past, but also reduce labor intensity and save expenses. Now, the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Administration is studying these new-style farm implements in order to further improve them and promote them better to farmers. At the same time, the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Administration is testing the effectiveness of new-style single animal paddy field plows in farms and agricultural production cooperatives in Jinhua, Xindeng, Pinghu, and other counties, and demonstrating and promoting them to farmers. This kind of plow has many advantages and is very popular among farmers.

    山西省供销合作社积极推广新式畜力农具
    浙江省农民创造了许多新式农具
    随着农业生产互助合作组织的发展，山西省农民要求供应大量新式畜力农具。据晋南、长治、忻县三个专区的统计，今年秋耕期间农民就要求供应双轮双铧犁三千一百多部。到十月底止，山西省供销合作社已经从东北、北京等地的农具制造厂买回双轮双铧犁一千五百部，有一部分已经供应到农民手中。这些双轮双铧犁受到农民热烈欢迎。平顺县北甘泉乡农民贾超喜说：“我活了六十多岁，没有看见过这样好的犁。耕起地来又深又平，还能省畜力、省人工。真是要提高农业生产，离不开工人老大哥啊！”屯留县老军庄村在试验双轮双铧犁的时候，由中共村支部向农民宣传了国家社会主义工业化的远景，推动了农业生产互助合作运动的开展。现在这个村的农民已经同供销合作社签订合同，要求明年供应双轮双铧犁四部、马拉农具一套。
    山西省供销合作社在十一月上旬召开各专区办事处生产资料科科长会议，决定在重点示范的基础上，积极推广新式畜力农具。全省初步计划在一九五五年推广双轮双铧犁两万部；供应对象主要是国营农场，经济作物区、碱性地区和平川地区的农业生产合作社和条件较好的互助组。此外，全省在一九五五年还准备供应收割机二百部、十行播种机二百部、五行播种机二百二十部、中耕器一千三百多部、新式步犁一万部、水车五千五百部，以及一批打稻机和脱谷机。为了及时把使用新式畜力农具的技术传授给广大农民，山西省供销合作社和各专区已经在十月份分别训练了一批技术干部；不少县还计划利用农闲季节，训练一批铁匠、木匠、高小毕业生和农业生产合作社的技术员。（梁嘉栋）
    浙江省农民创造了许多新式农具。据省农业机械管理局统计，在最近四个半月中，各地报来农民创造的农具已有八十五件，报到各专署和县人民政府的就更多了。这些农具大都是根据各地区生产特点创造出来的。如杭州、嘉兴、湖州是水网地区，水车的用途很大，农民在水车上配上弹子盘，因而减少了阻力，效率提高了很多。浙南山区地带，大量生产杂粮，农民就创造了蕃薯刨丝机和玉米脱粒机，效率提高三至四倍。此外，还创造了剥麻机、播种机（以播种小麦、棉花为主）、耙田机、油菜脱粒机以及利用畜力的插秧机、用柴油机带动二部龙骨水车抽水等。使用这些新式农具，不仅效率能比过去提高，而且可降低劳动强度，节省开支。现在省农业机械管理局正在研究这些新式农具，以求得进一步改进和更好的向农民推广。同时省农业机械管理局正在金华、新登、平湖等县农场和农业生产合作社，试验新式单畜水田犁的效能，向农民示范推广。这种犁优点很多，很受农民的欢迎。  （本报集体通讯员浙江日报编辑部）
