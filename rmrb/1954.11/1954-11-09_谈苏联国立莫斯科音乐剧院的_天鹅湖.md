    Talking about the "Swan Lake" of the Soviet National Moscow Musical Theater
    Chen Jinqing, Vice President of Beijing Dance School

    In 1876, the Russian genius composer Tchaikovsky completed the music for "Swan Lake." It premiered in Moscow in 1877. In 1895, after being choreographed by Lev Ivanov, this brilliant work gained its life on stage for the first time, conquering and enthralling all audiences in a truly symphonic ballet form, achieving worldwide fame.

    For more than half a century, through the continuous efforts of many artists and ballet choreographers such as A. Gorsky, and genius actors such as Ulanova and Duchenskaya, in exploring and revealing the composer's genius works, their interpretations and performances have become an unshakable model in the performance of "Swan Lake" and one of the treasures in the Soviet art treasury. Anyone who has been to Moscow will never forget Ulanova's performance of "Swan Lake" at the Bolshoi Theatre.

    In 1953, the Soviet National Moscow Musical Theater named after Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko achieved brilliant new achievements with a brand-new libretto performance of "Swan Lake," winning praise from Moscow's art circles. Recently, the Soviet National Moscow Musical Theater brought six precious performances to the Chinese people, one of which is the newly performed "Swan Lake" that we have long yearned for.

    When we in Beijing's literary and art circles watched the rehearsal of their "Swan Lake," many people in the lounge exclaimed in admiration. An old teacher who has been engaged in dance art education for decades once said with emotion:
    "For so many years, I never thought that 'Swan Lake' could be performed like this... Beautiful, so beautiful!" Yes, this is a genius performance. It perfectly reveals the beauty of the soul of Tchaikovsky's work to us. The genius female dancer and actress, Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Bovt, played the roles of Odette, the white swan, and Odile, the daughter of the evil spirit. She brilliantly created these two distinctly different images. Her performance of Odette is so sincere, straightforward, and frank; her performance of Odile fully expresses the dual character of this image. How exciting and expressive are her rapid rotations in the dance!

    "Swan Lake" was originally a folk myth. It describes Prince Siegfried seeing a flock of swans flying in the air while feasting in the wild, and he chases after them. Late at night, by the tranquil lake, the prince sees the flock of swans transform into beautiful maidens, and he falls in love with Odette among them. Odette tells the prince about her plight. She was transformed into a white swan by the evil sorcerer Rothbart's magic, and only loyal love can break the sorcerer's magic on her. The prince makes a vow of love to her. The next day, in the palace, the queen mother holds a grand gathering for the prince to choose a fiancée. Distinguished guests are present, and the evil sorcerer uses magic to transform himself into a knight and brings his daughter Odile, deceiving the prince in various ways, making the prince mistakenly believe that the sorcerer's daughter is Odette. When the sorcerer's trick is fulfilled, and the oath is being sworn, a white swan appears outside the palace. The prince realizes he has been deceived and chases to the lake; he is in pain, regretful, and begs Odette's forgiveness. The evil sorcerer uses magic again to flood the lake, attempting to drown the prince. At this moment, the white swan resolutely throws herself into the lake, sharing weal and woe with the prince. True love destroys the evil sorcerer's magic, and the lovers begin their happy life.

    The outstanding dancers of the Musical Theater—Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Stalin Prize winner Bulmeister and Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Gusev, they firmly grasped the theme of "Swan Lake"—love conquers death, good conquers evil, making the entire ballet more complete; all characters, events, music, and dance are organized under this idea. They ingeniously adapted Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" overture into a prologue. This is a very touching scene. The beautiful music depicts the beautiful and gentle Princess Odette picking flowers by the tranquil lake. When she steps onto the rock to pick them, a pair of large eagle wings stretch down from above and snatch her away. The princess's shawl is left on the rock, and white swans swim across the lake. Adding this prologue provides a cause for the subsequent events and more vividly shows the two contrasting figures—the evil sorcerer and the princess.

    The handling of the first act also gave me many new feelings. How Prince (played by Chiginaze) was before he met the white swan is clearly shown here. He is bored with palace life, he is very melancholy, especially when the palace maids are dancing happily, the prince plays the pipa, and the sorrowful melody interrupts their joyful dance. The mood of this act is very cheerful, the village girls dance, the friends dance, only the prince's mood is almost lonely.

    The second act is based on Ivanov's choreography. This is a very lyrical and beautiful dance, especially the expression of the white swan's mood, her misfortune, her love, and the entire image, which reaches an extremely delicate state. When the white swan first meets the prince, she is somewhat afraid. Gradually, because of the prince's sincerity, the white swan dispels her doubts. Here, from the slow pas de deux expressing the white swan confiding her suffering to the prince, it develops into a passionate love, and the flock of swans all come to congratulate their love. However, the evil sorcerer Rothbart (played by Krein) stands on a high rock, constantly peering at them with hateful eyes, driving the swans back to the lake. When the white swan is about to leave the prince, she is so sad and reluctant to leave, but she has to leave, and the prince clutches a feather left by the white swan and is immersed in pain. Such a series of deep and complex emotions are vividly expressed through Tchaikovsky's music, the image of the swan, and the techniques of ballet, which makes people feel intimately infected and evokes deep sympathy. When the swan appears on the lake again, we cannot help but be saddened and sigh for her misfortune.

    The third act is handled very rigorously and successfully. In this act, the contradiction of the entire ballet is revealed and developed head-on. The directors grasped the key to the contradiction—from the prince's remembering Odette, the queen mother (played by Belge) wanting the prince to choose a fiancée, and the evil sorcerer using magic to deceive the prince, they handled the entire act's plot and dance scenes through these aspects. The directors successfully treated the Spanish dance, Hungarian dance, Mazurka dance, etc., as dances performed by the evil sorcerer's attendants, and they danced so enchantingly and unpredictably. The evil sorcerer's daughter Odile, who appears intermittently, tempts the prince, the lighting on the stage also changes, the music also has a mysterious atmosphere, and the entire stage atmosphere presents the power of the evil sorcerer's rule. In this way, the contradiction of the whole play develops to a very acute degree, and the prince's deception and breach of oath makes us worry, causing a fluctuation in the plot development, and at the same time, various dances are organically organized under one idea, which is the successful new creation of the directors. Some details are also handled very appropriately; for example, the candidate brides are introduced into the palace covered in veils. When the veils are lifted, some are shy, some are reluctant, and some are very hopeful to be selected. This kind of handling makes the characters appear very reasonable and clear.

    The fourth act is the climax of the play. I never thought it would be handled so concisely and movingly. The performance of the three main characters in the play reached the most perfect state. The white swan returns to the lake with a heart full of pain, and the flock of swans comforts her. Out of sympathy and indignation, the flock of swans prevents the prince from approaching the white swan. Even so, the white swan still loves him, forgives him, and has to bid him farewell forever. When the prince is struggling in the water drowned by the evil sorcerer, the white swan resolutely throws herself into the lake to share life and death with the prince, sacrificing herself for love. This kind of handling makes the image of the pure white swan, steadfast in her love, fuller and more sympathetic. The prince is filled with remorse and comes to ask the white swan for forgiveness. When he learns that the loss of love is due to the evil sorcerer's destruction, he bravely rushes to the rock to fight the evil sorcerer, who uses the flooding lake to drown him. The evil sorcerer's actions are very concise and strong from beginning to end. When he spreads his huge black wings, stirring up waves to engulf the kind and enthusiastic people, in order to maintain his rule over Swan Lake, the lake surface is filled with gloomy mist, making us feel the heaviness of evil. But, the victorious brass instruments of the struggle sounded, and Odette, with irresistible love, plunged into the lake—love finally conquered death, and good finally conquered evil—the evil sorcerer's giant wings were broken, burned and collapsed along with the rocks, and submerged in Swan Lake. A loving young couple, due to the destruction of the evil sorcerer, were reborn in the waves and walked towards happiness under the shining morning sun. The dramatic action of this final act developed quickly, concisely, and powerfully, leaving a deep impression on the audience.

    The Musical Theater's "Swan Lake" achieved such great success not without reason. The great playwright Stanislavsky once taught us that the performance of any work must be creative and not imitate others' performances. And he taught us that the performance of any classical work should not arbitrarily alter the writer's original spirit and thought, but should respect the writer's thought and be good at exploring and interpreting it. The artists of the Musical Theater, following Stanislavsky's path, have a sincere love and respect for classical art. Over the years, they have conducted enormous research and exploration of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" score, and have inherited the excellent foundation laid by previous and contemporary dancers for "Swan Lake," and used creative spirit and Stanislavsky's methods to re-handle the music and dance of "Swan Lake." In particular, the third and fourth acts that they changed and the addition of the prologue made the connecting action of the whole play more complete and powerful, which more clearly completed the theme idea; this is inseparable from the teachings of Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko.

    The achievements of Soviet culture and art are unparalleled in the world. This is not only because she has extremely rich and excellent traditions and outstanding artists such as Bulmeister and Gusev, but also because for decades, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have always been concerned about Soviet art and cherished classical art, and have continuously provided help and guidance.

    I believe that the performance of "Swan Lake" in China has not only left us with a very beautiful impression, but also will have a huge impact on the development of dance art in our country. (Attached picture)

    谈苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院的“天鹅湖”
    北京舞蹈学校副校长  陈锦清
    俄罗斯天才的作曲家柴可夫斯基在一八七六年完成了“天鹅湖”的乐曲。一八七七年在莫斯科首次上演。一八九五年经过列夫·伊万诺夫编导，这部光辉的作品才第一次在舞台上获得了它的生命，以真正交响乐化的舞剧形式征服了、倾倒了所有的观众，取得了世界性的声誉。
    半个多世纪以来，经过多少艺术家和舞剧编导阿·戈尔斯基及天才的演员乌兰诺娃和杜琴斯卡娅等不断的努力发掘、揭示作曲家的天才作品，使得他们的解释、演出成为“天鹅湖”演出中不可动摇的典范；成为苏维埃艺术宝库中珍宝之一。任何到过莫斯科的人，都会终生不忘地常常回忆起大剧院乌兰诺娃表演的“天鹅湖”。
    一九五三年，以苏联人民艺术家斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇——丹钦科命名的苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院却以“天鹅湖”崭新的台本演出，获得了光辉灿烂的新的成就，博得莫斯科艺术界的好评。最近，苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院给中国人民带来了六个珍贵的演出节目，其中之一即是我们向往已久的新演出的“天鹅湖”。
    在我们北京文艺界观摩他们“天鹅湖”的彩排的时候，休息室中，曾有多少人啧啧称羡。有一位从事舞蹈艺术教育数十年的老教师曾经感慨地说：
  “多少年啊，我都没想到过‘天鹅湖’可以这样演出的……美，真美！”是的，这是个天才的演出。它完美地向我们揭示了柴可夫斯基的作品灵魂的优美。天才的女舞蹈家和女演员、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员鲍夫特在剧中扮演了白天鹅奥杰塔和恶魔女儿奥吉丽雅两个角色。她出色地创造了这两个截然不同的形象。她演奥杰塔是那样真诚、爽直、坦白；她演的奥吉丽雅，却充分地表现了这一形象的双重性格。她的舞蹈的急速的旋转是多么激动人心、富有表现力！
      “天鹅湖”原来是民间的神话故事。它描写王子齐格弗里德在野外欢宴时见到空中飞过一群天鹅，他追踪而去。深夜，在平静的湖边，王子见到鹅群变成美丽的少女，他爱上了其中的奥杰塔。奥杰塔向王子倾诉了自己的遭遇，她原是被恶魔罗特巴尔特的妖术变成了白天鹅的，只有忠诚的爱情才能解脱恶魔对她所施的妖术。王子对她订下了爱的盟誓。第二天，在宫庭里，母后为王子选择未婚妻而举行盛会，贵宾如云，恶魔用妖法把自己变成骑士，带来自己的女儿奥吉丽雅，用种种方法欺骗王子，使王子误认了恶魔的女儿是奥杰塔。当恶魔的诡计实现了，正举行盟誓时，白天鹅出现在宫庭外面。王子知道受骗，追踪到湖边；他痛苦，失悔，请求奥杰塔的宽恕。恶魔又施妖术使湖水泛滥，企图淹死王子，这时候，白天鹅毅然投湖，同王子共赴患难。坚贞的爱情击毁了恶魔的妖术，相爱的人开始了他们幸福的生活。
    音乐剧院杰出的舞蹈家——俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者布尔梅斯杰尔和俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员古谢夫，他们紧紧地掌握了“天鹅湖”的主题思想——爱战胜了死，善战胜了恶，使整个舞剧更完整；一切人物、事件，音乐、舞蹈都组织在这个意念之下。他们天才地把柴可夫斯基“天鹅湖”的序曲编排成序幕。这是很感人的一场，优美的音乐描绘出美丽温柔的公主奥杰塔在恬静的湖边采花，当她走上石岩去采摘时，从上面伸下一对大鹰长翅，把她攫走了，山岩上留下公主的披巾；湖上游过白天鹅。增添了这场序幕，使以后发生的情节有了前因，也更鲜明地表现出两个对比人物——恶魔和公主。
    第一幕的处理，也使我获得许多新的感受。王子（奇吉纳则饰）在遇到白天鹅之前是怎样一个人物，在这里表现得很清晰。他对宫庭生活厌烦，他很忧郁，特别是宫女们在欢快地跳舞时，王子却弹着琵琶，那哀愁的曲调打断她们的欢舞。这一幕的情调是很快活的，村姑们跳着舞，朋友们跳着舞，只有王子的心情是近乎孤独的。
    第二幕是以伊万诺夫的排演作基础的。这一场非常抒情而优美的舞蹈，特别是表现白天鹅的心境，她的不幸，她的爱情以及整个形象，都达到极细腻的境界。白天鹅刚一见到王子，她有些畏惧，逐渐，由于王子的真诚，使白天鹅消除了疑虑。这里，从徐缓的对舞表现白天鹅向王子倾诉苦情，发展到挚热的恋爱，群鹅都来祝贺他们的爱情。可是恶魔罗特巴尔特（克列英饰）站在高岩上，不时用仇恨的目光窥视他们，把天鹅们赶回到湖面上去。当白天鹅将要离开王子时，她是多么伤心难舍，又不得不离去，王子紧握着一根白天鹅留下的羽毛而沉溺在痛苦中。这样一连串感情很深、很复杂的情节，用柴可夫斯基的音乐、天鹅的形象和巴蕾舞的技巧，表现得淋漓尽致，使人亲切地受到感染，引起人们深切的同情。当天鹅又在湖上出现时，我们不能不为她的不幸而悲伤，叹息。
    第三幕处理得很严密而且非常成功。在这一幕中，整个舞剧的矛盾正面地揭开了，发展了。排演者抓住了矛盾的关键——从王子怀念着奥杰塔、母后（别尔格饰）要王子选择未婚妻、恶魔施用妖术使王子受骗，通过这几方面来处理整幕的情节和舞蹈场面。排演者成功地把西班牙舞、匈牙利舞、玛佐尔卡舞等都处理为恶魔的侍从们跳的，而且跳得这样的妖艳而变幻无常，时隐时现地出现的恶魔的女儿奥吉丽雅诱惑着王子，舞台上的灯光也变了，音乐也带着神秘的气氛，整个舞台气氛呈现出恶魔统治的力量。这样，使全剧的矛盾发展到非常尖锐的程度，由王子的受骗背盟而使我们耽心，在剧情发展上起了跌荡，同时又把各种舞蹈有机地组织在一个意念下，这是排演者成功的新的创造。某些细节也处理得非常恰当；如候选新妇们罩着面纱被引进宫，揭开面纱时，有害羞的，有勉强的，也有很希望被选上的。这样的处理，使人物出现得很合理，很明确。
    第四幕是全剧的高潮，我怎么样也没想到会处理到如此简练动人，对全剧三个主要人物的表现，达到了最完善的境界。白天鹅带着痛苦万状的心情回到湖边，群鹅安慰她，由于同情和义愤，群鹅不让王子接近白天鹅。虽然如此，白天鹅还是爱他，原谅他，又不得不向他永诀。当王子被恶魔淹在水里挣扎时，白天鹅决然地投湖同王子共生死，为爱情而自我牺牲。这样的处理，使纯洁、对爱情坚贞不拔的白天鹅的形象更饱满，更令人同情。王子悔恨交集来请求白天鹅的宽恕。当他知道失去爱情是由于恶魔的破坏时，勇敢地冲上石岩去同恶魔搏斗，恶魔用泛滥的湖水来淹他。恶魔自始至终动作很简练而强烈，当他展开黑色的巨翅，兴风作浪来吞淹善良而热情的人们，以保持他对天鹅湖的统治的时候，湖面上阴雾惨惨，使我们感到邪恶的沉重。但，搏斗的胜利的铜管乐器响了，怀着不可抗拒的爱情的奥杰塔投入湖中——爱终于战胜了死，善终于战胜了恶——恶魔的巨翅折了，同岩石一起焚毁，崩溃，淹没在天鹅湖中。一对热爱着的青年男女，由于恶魔的毁灭，在浪涛中获得新生，在朝阳射照下走向幸福。这最后一幕的戏剧动作发展得快而简明有力，给观众铭刻下极深的印象。
    音乐剧院的“天鹅湖”获得如此巨大的成功不是没有原因的。伟大的戏剧家斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基曾经教导过我们，对于任何作品的演出，必须是创造性的，不要去因袭别人的演出。并且他教导我们对任何古典作品的演出都不应该任意纂改作家原来的精神和思想，应该尊重作家的思想，并善于去挖掘它，解释它。音乐剧院的艺术家们遵循着斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的道路，对古典艺术抱着真挚的热爱和尊敬，多少年来对柴可夫斯基的“天鹅湖”总谱进行了巨大的研究和挖掘，并且继承了前人及当代舞蹈家们为“天鹅湖”所奠定的优秀基础，用创造性的精神和斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的方法来重新处理了“天鹅湖”的音乐和舞蹈。尤其是他们所改动的第三、四幕及增添序幕，使得全剧的贯串动作更完整和有力，这就更明确地完成了主题思想；这是同斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇——丹钦科的教导分不开的。
    苏联文化艺术上的成就在全世界是无与伦比的。这不仅是由于她有着极丰富而优秀的传统和具有卓越的艺术家如布尔梅斯杰尔和古谢夫等，更由于几十年来，苏联共产党和苏联政府经常关心苏维埃艺术和爱护古典艺术，不断地给以帮助和指导。
    我认为，“天鹅湖”在中国的演出，不仅给我们留下了非常美丽的印象，而且在我国舞蹈艺术的发展上，将起巨大的影响。（附图片）
