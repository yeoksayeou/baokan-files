Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 27th: The eastern section of the Kangzang Highway was fully opened to traffic at 1:00 PM on the 24th, six days ahead of schedule. Thus, 1,927 kilometers of the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway, westward from Ya'an, are now open to traffic. On the afternoon of the 24th, a convoy carrying steel materials set off for the bridge construction site on the Nyang River. Bridge workers are working at double speed. Once this bridge is built, vehicles will be able to travel directly from Ya'an to the east bank of the Lhasa River. The Kangzang Highway Construction Headquarters is now preparing for the construction of the Lhasa River Bridge, and the steel for the bridge has been gathered and will soon be transported westward.

    The construction speed of the last phase of the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway, a 70-kilometer stretch, has exceeded all previous records. The work efficiency of workers and road construction soldiers has generally exceeded the quota by more than 100%. The current average work efficiency is more than twice as high as that in 1950.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 27th: After the Qinghai-Tibet Highway opened to traffic to Heihe, Tibet, on the 16th, it advanced more than 150 kilometers towards Lhasa. Now the highway is extending towards the vast grassland south of Tengri Lake, and the advance team of road builders has reached the foot of the Gangqingla Snow Mountain, 80 kilometers away from Lhasa.

    The Tibetan people in the Heihe area have organized a support committee to help the road construction troops transport supplies. A large number of yak teams have been dispatched from various pastoral areas. The people in the agricultural area south of Yangbajing are also actively preparing to welcome the road construction troops.

    The entire Qinghai-Tibet Highway road construction team is highly enthusiastic in their work, encouraged by the slogan "Strive to Open to Traffic to Lhasa by the End of the Year." Soldiers from a certain unit braved the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, erected a bridge over the Heihe River in ten hours, and built a road surface for water crossing in a riverbed that was 1.5 meters deep.

    青藏公路筑路人员争取年底通车到拉萨
   【新华社拉萨二十七日电】康藏公路东段已在二十四日下午一时全段通车，比预定时间提前了六天。至此，康藏公路东段从雅安往西，已有一千九百二十七公里通车。二十四日下午，载运钢材的车队，已开往尼洋河边的架桥工地。桥梁工人正以加倍的速度工作着。这座桥架好后，汽车即可由雅安一直开到拉萨河东岸。现在康藏公路修建司令部正在进行架设拉萨河大桥的准备工作，架桥钢材已经调齐，即将西运。
    康藏公路东段最后一期工程的七十公里线路，工程进展速度超过了历年的纪录，工人和筑路战士的工作效率普遍超过了定额一倍以上，以目前的平均工作效率与一九五零年相比，已高出两倍以上。
   【新华社拉萨二十七日电】青藏公路十六日通车到西藏黑河后，又向拉萨推进了一百五十多公里。现在公路正向腾格里海南部的大草原伸延，筑路先头部队已到达距拉萨八十公里的岗青拉雪山下。
    黑河地区的藏族人民组织了支援委员会，帮助筑路部队运输物资，大批的牦牛队已自各牧区源源出动。羊八井南部农业区的人民，也正在积极进行迎接筑路部队的工作。
    青藏公路全体筑路人员在“争取年底通车拉萨”的口号鼓舞下，劳动热情很高。某部战士冒着零下二十多度的严寒，在十小时内就架起了黑河河上的桥梁，并在水深一公尺五的河床上，修好了过水路面。
