The Development of Native and Special Products in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, is Rapid

    Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province is rich in more than a dozen kinds of native and special products such as hemp, wool, Codonopsis pilosula, and Chinese prickly ash. With the strong support of the state in recent years, these native and special products have greatly developed. Taking hemp production as an example, the total hemp production in the entire special district in 1949 was more than 6.3 million catties. Last year, the total hemp production in the entire special district was more than 22 million catties, an increase of more than two times compared with 1949. In Zhao Township, Pingshun County, only 30 farming households planted Codonopsis pilosula in 1952, with an annual output of more than 4,800 catties. This year, it has increased to 220 households, with an expected output of more than 50,000 catties. In addition to pruning the existing Chinese prickly ash trees, the farmers in Beidanche Township have also newly planted more than 6,000 Chinese prickly ash saplings. The Pingshun County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent cadres to Tunliu, Lucheng and other places to purchase more than 75,000 catties of Codonopsis pilosula seedlings and 10,000 Chinese prickly ash saplings to supply to farmers. Due to the development of native and special product production, farmers are selling more and more native and special products to the state year by year. According to the statistics of the Changzhi Purchasing Station of the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative: last year, the total value of native and special products purchased in the entire district was more than 127 billion yuan, more than six times that of 1950. As of the end of September this year, the value of native and special products purchased in the entire district has reached more than 113 billion yuan, close to the total purchase volume of last year.

    山西省长治专区土产特产发展很快
    山西省长治专区盛产麻、羊毛、党参、花椒等十几种土特产。几年来在国家的大力扶持下，这些土特产已有了很大发展。以麻的生产来说，一九四九年全专区共产麻六百三十多万斤，去年全专区产麻二千二百多万斤，比一九四九年增加二倍多。平顺县赵城乡一九五二年只有三十户农民栽种党参，年产四千八百多斤，今年就增加到二百二十户，可产党参五万多斤。北耽车乡农民除了修剪原有花椒树外，还新栽种了六千余株花椒树秧。平顺县供销合作社还派干部到屯留、潞城等地买了七万五千多斤党参秧、一万株花椒树秧供应农民。由于土特产生产的发展，农民卖给国家的土特产一年比一年增多。据山西省供销合作社长治收购站的统计：去年全区收购土特产的总值一千二百七十多亿元，超过一九五○年六倍多，今年截至九月底统计，全区已收购土特产价值一千一百三十多亿元，接近了去年全年的收购量。
