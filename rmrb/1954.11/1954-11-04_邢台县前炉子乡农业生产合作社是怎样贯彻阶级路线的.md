The Zhangjiaying Village of Qianluzi Township, Xingtai County, firmly implemented the policy of resolutely not allowing rich peasants to join the cooperative before it was consolidated when establishing the agricultural producers' cooperative before the autumn harvest. At that time, some cadres advocated absorbing rich peasants into the cooperative. Other cadres immediately suggested: "Absorbing rich peasants into the cooperative now is like building a house on ice. If the foundation is not well laid, although it may seem habitable now, the house will collapse after the ice melts." As a result, rich peasants were refused entry. They knew that four of the eight agricultural producers' cooperatives in the township's eight villages were newly established before this autumn, and the other four were only one year old. If landlords and rich peasants were allowed to join now, there would be no guarantee to prevent them from causing trouble in the cooperative.

The Party organization of Qianluzi Township also had good experience in relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants. Ma Yuxi, the secretary of the general branch, said: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the land reform, we relied on poor peasants and firmly united with middle peasants. Now that there is peace, some people have become vague on this aspect, feeling that there is no class struggle anymore. In fact, the transition period is quite long, and the class struggle is becoming increasingly complex. It is even more necessary to rely on poor peasants and firmly unite with middle peasants." The general branch committee of this township not only understood this principle but also had profound practical experience. Ma Yuxi said: "The higher-level Party committee often tells us about the class line. We have also truly experienced the need to implement the class line in practice. When we started organizing cooperatives last spring, sixty-three households signed up to join. We felt that we lacked experience and were afraid of messing things up with so many households, so we proposed: those who are willing to wait a year before joining can withdraw first. With this proposal, fifteen households withdrew. We looked and saw that most of them were old middle peasants, and some were relatively wealthy new middle peasants. At this time, we thought: poor peasants were not only the most resolute during the land reform but also the most resolute in joining agricultural producers' cooperatives; middle peasants were hesitant, wanting to join but also fearing losses." They saw that both poor and middle peasants could take the socialist road, but they also saw the differences between them. Liu Zeng'en, a cadre of the Houluzi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in this township, put it well: "Poor peasants have one thought, wholeheartedly wanting to take the socialist road, and are very resolute in joining the cooperative; middle peasants have two thoughts, sometimes wanting to join, sometimes not wanting to join. They feel that joining the cooperative is okay, and not joining is also okay." Why? "Poor peasants have little and poor land, lack livestock and farm tools, and have difficulty producing on their own, so they are very willing to engage in collective production. Furthermore, they know that whether they join the cooperative or not, they rely on labor to eat, so they have no worries." What about middle peasants? "Middle peasants also know that socialism is good, so they want to join the cooperative. However, they also feel that socialism comes slowly and cannot be enjoyed at the time, so they want to work on their own and live a good life themselves." Zhao Jingui, the deputy director of the Houluzi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, said: "The Party's policy is to restrict the exploitation of rich peasants, and the state has also implemented a policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Middle peasants cannot hoard grain either, and the capitalist road has been blocked, so they demand to join the cooperative; but they are also afraid of suffering losses." He cited the example of Gu Laowai, a middle peasant in their village. Gu Laowai's family had no labor force and usually relied on a "head of household," Gu Shoulan, to help with production; now that Gu Shoulan has joined the cooperative, he has difficulty producing on his own and wants to join the cooperative. He also heard that landlords and rich peasants were not allowed to join the cooperative, and thought: if I don't join the cooperative, wouldn't I be standing with the landlords and rich peasants? So he has to join the cooperative even more. But he is always afraid of suffering losses. His family has two livestock and wants to sell one and bring one into the cooperative. Later, the village cadres told him that livestock brought into the cooperative would receive certain compensation, and he could also accumulate manure to sell to the cooperative. Only if the cooperative has livestock and manure can it produce more grain, and he would be able to distribute more. Gu Laowai understood this principle and brought both livestock into the cooperative.

Why is it necessary to unite with middle peasants? In Ma Yuxi's words, it is because: middle peasants are also working farmers who were also exploited and oppressed by landlords in the past. Only when poor and middle peasants unite can their strength be greater, can they fight against rich peasants, and can they improve production.

Based on these practical experiences, they firmly grasped the policy of relying on poor peasants and firmly uniting with middle peasants in organizing and consolidating cooperatives. The township general branch committee once held a meeting and decided that all village branches should work hard to ensure that there were no land sales or begging in their villages. If land sales or begging occurred, it meant that the work of the village branch had not been done well. Therefore, when organizing agricultural producers' cooperatives, poor peasants should be absorbed first, and the cooperatives should be run by relying on poor peasants. Some cadres in Qianluzi Village were unwilling to allow poor peasants to join the cooperative, so the branch held a meeting to discuss "Who should the cooperative rely on?" As a result, everyone agreed that poor peasants should be actively absorbed. Some middle peasants had more land and less labor, and were afraid of suffering losses with poor peasants who had less land and more labor, so the branch held a meeting to unite poor and middle peasants, citing actual examples from the village: Yao Changyou's family had more land and less labor, so they harvested less grain; Wu Qingrui's family had less land and more labor, so they harvested more grain. It was also explained that more labor can produce more fertilizer, grow more vegetables (because this township is very close to Xingtai City), and increase income. The middle peasants understood the principle and were very happy.

They understood the middle peasants' fear of suffering losses, so in addition to enabling middle peasants to increase their income, they also paid attention to appropriately taking care of the interests of middle peasants in terms of livestock and farm tools, and adopted some appropriate transitional measures at the beginning of the cooperative to ensure that middle peasants were satisfied. Large farm tools mostly belonged to middle peasants. The agricultural producers' cooperatives in the villages of this township stipulated that farm tools were privately owned and used collectively, with value maintained and repairs guaranteed. For example, if a farm tool was worth 100,000 yuan, it would be valued and brought into the cooperative. If it was damaged during normal use, the cooperative would be responsible for repairs. If a member wanted to withdraw from the cooperative and the farm tool was only worth 80,000 yuan, the cooperative would return his original farm tool and compensate him with 20,000 yuan. Some middle peasants had rubber-wheeled carts, and the cooperative stipulated that during the busy farming season, carts and horses would work for the cooperative and be paid accordingly. During the slack season, the cart owners could operate transportation on their own. This not only ensured that the cooperative could use the carts and horses but also prevented the cart owners from losing fodder because they could not use their carts and horses during the slack season. Therefore, middle peasants with rubber-wheeled carts were very satisfied.

General Branch Secretary Ma Yuxi also said: "Poor and middle peasants have formed an alliance economically, and they must also form an alliance politically. In material terms, we must take care of the interests of middle peasants, and in political terms, we must also pay attention to uniting middle peasants." Therefore, they selected middle peasants with ability, production experience, and prestige among the masses to serve in certain positions in the cooperative and participate in leadership. Ma Yuxi said: "This can mobilize the general middle peasants. This is beneficial to running the cooperative."

Wu Jingcai, the captain of the third team of the Qianluzi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, was a poor peasant, and Xiao Shicheng, the deputy captain, was a middle peasant. Xiao Shicheng was capable and knew how to arrange work, and work under his leadership was not idle. However, he could not boldly carry out criticism in his leadership work and was too considerate of personal feelings. Gu Qin in their team was not active in work, and the members had opinions and hoped that the captain could criticize him, but Xiao Shicheng always excused him. He said: "He was like that when he worked on his own, that's just his temperament." The members were very dissatisfied. Captain Wu Jingcai was not like this. He was very fair in dealing with matters. No matter who it was, if they did less work or did it poorly, they would definitely have their points deducted. He criticized whoever had shortcomings. Ge Chunfa, the leader of the second team, was a middle peasant and produced very well, but he was afraid of offending people. He was also unwilling to report the shortcomings of the members to the leaders of the cooperative; Hu Jingquan, a member of this team, was a poor peasant, and he was different from Ge Chunfa. He could truthfully report any problems in the team to the leaders of the cooperative. Therefore, the township general branch committee and the leaders of the cooperative had a clear understanding. Although not all middle peasants have such shortcomings, and not all poor peasants have such advantages, generally speaking, there are differences between poor and middle peasants. This is something they often consider when carrying out work and dealing with problems.

After being educated, middle peasants love socialism and are active in production. However, in these agricultural producers' cooperatives with only one year of history, especially those that have just been established, the backward side of middle peasants' thinking is still significantly manifested in production. This is also different from the general poor peasants. "In a newly established cooperative in our village, there is a member named Liu Yunpeng who only wants to plow his own land. He says: I will plow as much as I should, and I will record as many work points as I should, anyway, I am plowing in my own land...." Liu Tongren, the deputy director of the Wangjiaying Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in this township, had just said this when Yang Xizhu, a female member of the Qianluzi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, heard it and interjected: "The one you are talking about must be an old middle peasant, definitely not someone who has been liberated. This is the same as when our village just established a cooperative last year. Our cooperative implemented a contract system, and the old middle peasants Gu Qin and Ren Hua insisted on contracting their own land. They were also willing to apply fertilizer to their own land." Of course, these phenomena are not surprising when people have just joined the cooperative. Liu Shenghe, a middle peasant in Houluzi Village who has been in the cooperative for a year, is still hot and cold in production. When his mind is in the cooperative, he is very happy to work, fast and good, and he also says: "Serving the members, the level of points doesn't matter." But after a few days, his mind goes back home, he is not energetic in his work, and he always says: "This won't work, the points assigned are too low." Sometimes he is very anxious to get work, but he is not anxious to work. Getting the work is to earn points, but sometimes he is very lax in doing it. When he sees that others have work to do and he has no work to do, he finds the team leader to shout: "Do only you do the work?" If he sees that other teams have work to do and his team has no work to do, he also finds the team leader to shout: "Other teams have work to do, and our team has no work to do. In the autumn, they will distribute more things, and we will distribute less things!" Wang Shuzhen, a poor peasant member of the same cooperative, is different from Liu Shenghe. Wang Shuzhen joined the cooperative with one heart, and she works with one spirit.

In order to overcome the hot-and-cold phenomenon in production among some middle peasants, the cooperative constantly educates them with a warm attitude, telling them: if you do not actively take the socialist road, what road will you take? If everyone works together, the cooperative will increase production, which is beneficial to everyone and to the country. The Houluzi Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative has repeatedly spoken at various meetings about the superiority shown by the old cooperatives in Qianluzi Village in production, and the incomes of poor and middle peasants have greatly increased. This year, the Houluzi Village Cooperative also publicly announced the income of each household in the autumn pre-distribution, compared with the individual households, and compared with last year, at the members' meeting, and posted a list. Combining these facts, they explained the truth of socialist transformation of agriculture and pointed out the bright future of socialism to the peasants. Seeing these, the ideologically unstable middle peasants received the most practical education and their spirits were uplifted. The cooperative also plans to have poor peasants help middle peasants and use practical actions to motivate middle peasants. Wang Youfu, a poor peasant member of Qianluzi Village, is responsible for helping Xing Haozhi, a middle peasant member, and educates him with practical examples: Xing Baoyu works well and gets more things distributed; Gu Yunxiang gets fewer things distributed because he does not work actively. Under such education and help, Xing Haozhi, a member who had withdrawn from the cooperative, is now working very well.

Facts have proved that after the middle peasants' thinking is gradually improved and their doubts are gradually dispelled, they are willing to work with the poor peasants to improve the production of the cooperative and take the socialist road together with the poor peasants. The cadres of the Houluzi Village Cooperative once said to Liu Shenghe, a middle peasant: if you still think that working on your own is good, you can withdraw from the cooperative. He replied affirmatively: "No! I will not withdraw from the cooperative! Others are going to socialism, and I cannot fall behind." His production enthusiasm also increased.

Does this township have any shortcomings in implementing the class line? Yes, it does. Some cadres only know how to restrict the exploitation of rich peasants and gradually eliminate the exploitation of rich peasants, but they neglect the issue of relying on poor peasants and firmly uniting with middle peasants, and neglect the relationship between poor and middle peasants, or they have an incomplete and incorrect understanding of relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants. In this township, it is very glorious to mention "liberated households," but it has an inglorious meaning to mention "middle peasants," and even some people do not want others to say that they are middle peasants. This is a misconception.

General Branch Secretary Ma Yuxi finally said: "After the cooperative was established, the cooperative increased production, and the Party's prestige among the masses was further enhanced. Both poor and middle peasants support the Party even more. In the future, as long as the work is done well, the unity of poor and middle peasants will be further strengthened, the enthusiasm for production will be further improved, and the selfish and self-interested thinking of middle peasants will be gradually overcome." At the same time, he also saw the long-term and arduous nature of the socialist transformation, especially the ideological transformation of the peasants. He said: It is not possible to completely overcome the peasants' selfish and self-interested thinking in just a few years. Even poor peasants cannot relax their education.

    邢台县前炉子乡农业生产合作社是怎样贯彻阶级路线的
    杜敬　萧特　王兴汉
    河北省邢台县前炉子乡张家营村在秋收以前建立农业生产合作社时，就坚决执行了在社没有巩固前坚决不让富农入社的政策。当时有个别干部主张吸收富农入社。别的干部马上提出：“现在吸收富农入社，就好像在冰上盖房，根脚打不好，眼下虽说能住人，冰消了以后房子就塌了。”结果拒绝了富农入社。因为他们知道，全乡八个村的八个农业生产合作社，有四个是今年秋前刚刚建立起来的，另外四个也才有一年的历史，如果现在允许地主、富农入社，还没有把握防止他们在社里捣乱。
    前炉子乡党组织在依靠贫农、团结中农方面也有较好的经验。总支书记马玉玺说：“在抗日战争的时候，在土地改革的时候，我们都是依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农。现在和平了，有些人在这一方面就模糊了，觉得没有什么阶级斗争了。其实，过渡时期是相当长的，阶级斗争越来越复杂，更必须依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农。”这个乡的总支委员会不仅懂得这个道理，还有着深刻的实际体验。马玉玺说：“上级党委经常给我们讲阶级路线。我们也真正实际体验到必须贯彻阶级路线。去年春天开始组织社的时候，有六十三户报名入社。我们觉得没有经验，这么多户怕弄不好，就提出：谁愿意等一年再入社，可以先退出去。这样一提，就有十五户退出去了。我们看了看，绝大部分是老中农，还有个别比较富裕的新中农。这时我们就想：贫农不光在土地改革时最坚决，参加农业生产合作社也最坚决；中农就犹豫不定，又想入社，又怕吃亏。”他们看到了贫农和中农都可以走社会主义道路，但也看到了贫农和中农的不同。这乡后炉子村农业生产合作社干部刘增恩说得好：“贫农是一个思想，一心往社会主义道上走，入社很坚决；中农是两个思想，一会想入社，一会又不想入社，他们觉得入社也行，不入社也行。”为什么呢？“贫农土地少、土地薄，缺牲口，少农具，自己生产有困难，很愿意集体生产。再一说，他们知道不入社是靠劳动力吃饭，入了社也是靠劳动力吃饭，所以没有顾虑。”中农怎么样呢？“中农也知道社会主义好，所以想入社。可是他们又觉得社会主义来得慢，当时不能享受，所以又想自己干，自己过好日子。”后炉子村农业生产合作社副社长赵金贵说：“党的政策是限制富农剥削，国家又实行了粮食统购统销政策，中农想囤积粮食也不行了，资本主义的道路已经被堵死了，所以他们要求入社；可是入社又怕吃亏。”他举出本村中农谷老歪做例子。谷老歪家没有劳动力，平时就依靠一个“当家子”谷守兰帮助生产；现在谷守兰入了社，他自己生产有了困难，就想入社。他又听说不许地主、富农入社，就想：自己如果不入社，不就和地主、富农站在一起了吗？所以更得入社了。可是他又总怕自己吃亏。他家有两个牲口，想卖掉一个，带一个入社。后来村干部给他讲，牲口入到社里有一定的报酬，自己还能攒粪卖给社里，社里有牲口有粪才能多打粮食，自己也才能多分。谷老歪明白了这个道理，把两个牲口都入到社里了。
    为什么又必须团结中农呢？用马玉玺的话来说，那就是：中农也是劳动农民，过去也受地主的剥削和压迫，只有贫农和中农团结起来，力量才更大，才能和富农进行斗争，才能把生产搞好。
    就是根据这些实际体验，他们在组织合作社和巩固合作社当中，都紧紧掌握了依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农的政策。乡总支委员会曾经开会决定：各村支部都应当努力工作，做到本村没有卖地的，没有讨饭的。如果发生卖地或讨饭现象；就是村支部的工作没有做好。因此，在组织农业生产合作社的时候，应当首先吸收贫农参加，依靠贫农办社。前炉子村有的干部曾经不愿让贫农入社，支部就开会讨论“办社依靠谁？”结果都同意应当主动吸收贫农。有的中农土地多、劳动力少，和土地少、劳动力多的贫农在一起怕吃亏，支部就召开贫农中农团结会，举出本村的实际例子：姚长有家土地多、劳动力少，打的粮食就少；吴庆瑞家土地少、劳动力多，打的粮食就多。又说明，劳动力多了才能多弄肥料，多种菜（因这个乡离邢台城很近），多增加收入。中农明白了道理，很高兴。
    他们摸透了中农怕吃亏的心理，因此除了使中农也能增加收入外，在牲口、农具等方面都注意适当照顾中农的利益，并在开始办社时采取一些适当的过渡办法，做到使中农满意。大农具多是中农的。这乡各村农业生产合作社都规定农具私有伙用，保值保修。比如某一件农具值十万元，折价入社，平时如有损坏，社里负责修理。社员如要退社时，农具只值八万元了，社里除退还他的原有农具外，再给他补偿两万元。有的中农有胶皮轮大车，社里规定农忙时车马给社做活计算报酬，农闲时由车主自己去经营运输。这样既耽误不了社里使用车马，也免得车主在农闲时因使不开自己的车马而赔草料。因此有胶皮轮大车的中农很满意。
    总支书记马玉玺还说：“贫农和中农在经济上结成了联盟，还得在政治上结成联盟。在物质方面要照顾中农的利益，在政治上也得注意团结中农。”因此，他们就选有办事能力、有生产经验、在群众中有威信的中农担任社里的一定职务，参加领导。马玉玺说：“这样才能把一般中农带动起来。这样对办社有利。”
    前炉子村农业生产合作社第三队队长武景才是个贫农，副队长萧士诚是个中农。萧士诚有能力，会支配活，在他领导下做活不窝工。但是他在领导工作中不能勇敢地开展批评，过于照顾情面。他们队里的谷勤，干活不积极，社员们有意见，希望队长能对他提出批评，而萧士诚却总是原谅他。他说：“人家自己干活的时候也是那样，是那个脾气。”社员们很不满意。队长武景才却不是这样。他处事很公正，不管是谁，干的活少或干的不好，应当减分就一定减分。谁有缺点就批评谁。第二队的组长葛春法是中农，生产很好，就是怕得罪人，社员有缺点他也不愿向社的领导干部汇报；这个组的社员胡景全是贫农，他和葛春法不一样，组里的任何问题都能真实地向社的领导干部汇报。因此，乡的总支委员会和社的领导干部心里都有底。虽然不是所有的中农都有这样的缺点，也不是所有的贫农都有这样的优点，但一般说来，贫农和中农是有区别的。这一点，他们在进行工作和处理问题当中是经常考虑到的。
    中农经过教育以后，是热爱社会主义的，生产也是积极的。但在这些仅有一年历史、特别是刚刚建成的农业生产合作社里，中农思想上的落后的一面还很显著地表现在生产上。这也是和一般贫农有区别的。“我们村一个新建的社，有一个叫刘云鹏的社员，只愿在自己地里犁地，他说：该犁多少我就犁多少，该记几分工就记几分工，反正在我自己地里犁。……”这个乡的王家营村农业生产合作社副社长刘同仁刚说到这里，被前炉子村农业生产合作社妇女社员杨喜珠听见了，她接过来就说：“你说的这一定是一个老中农，一定不是翻身户。这和俺村去年刚成立社的时候一样，俺社实行的是包工制，老中农谷勤、任华，非要自己包自己的地不行，上粪也愿上到自己地里。”刚刚入社，这些现象当然不奇怪。后炉子村入社已经一年的中农刘升河，生产上还是一阵热一阵冷的。他的思想在社里的时候，做起活来很高兴，又快又好，还口口声声地说：“为社员服务，定分高低没关系。”可是过不了几天，他的思想又回了家，干起活来不起劲，还总是说：“这不行，定的分太低。”有时他要活很着急，干活不着急。把活要到手里是为了挣分，干起来却有时很松懈。他一看到别人有活干，自己没活干，就找到组长去嚷：“活只你们干吗？”如果看到别的组有活干，自己组没活干，也找到组长去嚷：“人家组有活，咱们组没活，到了秋后人家多分东西，咱们少分东西！”同一个社的贫农社员王书贞，同刘升河就不一样。王书贞入社是一个心，干起活来也是一个劲。
    为了克服某些中农在生产当中的忽冷忽热现象，社里不断用热情的态度对他们进行教育，告诉他们：如果不积极走社会主义的道路，会走到什么道路上去呢？大家齐心干，社里增了产，对每一个人、对国家都是有好处的。后炉子村农业生产合作社曾经一再在各种会议上讲前炉子村老社在生产中表现出来了优越性，贫农、中农的收入都大大增加。今年后炉子村社又把秋季预分配中各户的收入，和单干户的对比，和去年的对比，在社员大会上当众公布，并列表张贴出去。结合这些事实，讲解对农业进行社会主义改造的道理，给农民指出社会主义的光辉前途。思想不稳定的中农看到这些，受到了最实际的教育，情绪振奋起来。社里还有计划地让贫农去帮助中农，用实际行动去带动中农。前炉子村贫农社员王有富负责帮助中农社员邢好志，用实际例子教育他：邢宝玉劳动得好，分的东西就多；谷云祥因为不积极劳动，分的东西就少。在这样的教育帮助下，邢好志这个曾经退过社的社员，现在劳动很好。
    事实证明，中农的思想逐步提高以后，怀疑逐渐解除以后，是愿意和贫农一起把社的生产搞好，和贫农一起走社会主义道路的。后炉子村社干部曾对中农刘升河说：如果你还觉得单干好，可以退社。他肯定地回答道：“不！我不退社！别人往社会主义走，我也不能落在后边。”他的生产情绪也高了。
    这个乡在贯彻阶级路线方面有缺点没有？有的。有的干部只知道由限制富农剥削到逐渐消灭富农剥削，却忽视依靠贫农和巩固地团结中农，忽视贫农和中农的关系方面的问题，或者对于依靠贫农团结中农还有不完全正确的理解。在这个乡，一提“翻身户”是很光荣的，一提“中农”却有不光荣的意思，甚至有的人不愿让别人说自己是中农。这是一种错觉。
    总支书记马玉玺最后说：“办了社，社里增产了，党在群众中的威信更提高了。无论贫农和中农，都更加拥护党了。今后，只要工作做得好，贫农和中农的团结会进一步加强，生产情绪会更加提高，中农自私自利的思想会逐步克服。”同时他也看到社会主义改造事业特别是对农民进行思想改造的长期性和艰巨性，他说：彻底克服农民的自私自利思想，不是很短几年能够做到的。甚至连贫农在内，也不能放松教育。
