Introduction to Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant
Han Yun Cen, Chief Engineer of Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant

    A Beautiful Factory, Excellent Working Environment

    In Harbin, along the wide Heping Road, you will see an eight-story water tower standing opposite the famous Harbin Flax Factory. To the left of the water tower is an office building, and to the right is a three-story factory building. Not far away, there is a fountain, with three columns of water constantly shooting silver sprays into the air. Walls and fences enclose the water tower, buildings, fountain, and nearby structures. These walls, fences, and buildings are all painted light yellow, inlaid with white patterns. Lush green trees dot the surroundings. In the crisp autumn season, it resembles a beautiful oil painting, attracting thousands of pedestrians. This is the newly built, China’s first factory for manufacturing precision tools – the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant.

    The factory buildings are well-lit. Snow-white walls and reddish-brown floors make the brand-new blue-gray machines stand out. Powerful dust extraction equipment constantly sucks away the dust and debris produced during the production process. A comprehensive ventilation system thoroughly removes some slight smoke and mist from the hot processing workshops. In winter, an excellent warm air system keeps the workshops warm as spring. In the hot processing workshops, specially designed cold air devices continuously send cool air to the work areas, so that workers do not feel hot and tired.

    This factory has four main factory buildings: the measuring tool factory building, the cutting tool factory building, the woodworking factory building, and the tool repair factory building. In order to carry out necessary testing, research, and technical inspection work, the factory has special trial production workshops, metallographic laboratories, chemical laboratories, metrology laboratories, and performance testing stations. These workshops have all started trial production one after another. Steel that has been chemically analyzed and metallographically inspected is flowing steadily from the metal material warehouse into the production workshops along the established production routes. Some products have already come out of the last process, passed performance tests, and been marked with a “qualified” sign. In the near future, thousands of specifications of precision measuring tools and cutting tools will be continuously produced from the ends of each production line. We will see these cutting tools cutting thousands upon thousands of tons of steel in machine manufacturing plants across the country, turning them into machine parts. We will see these measuring tools precisely measuring the machine parts being manufactured during the cutting process, controlling their quality.

    Modern Equipment, Advanced Technological Methods

    This factory can be said to be equipped with the world's first-class machinery. Here, there is the Soviet Union's first machine ever produced, and there are specialized automatic machine tools specially designed and manufactured for us by the Soviet Union. In the drill bit workshop of the cutting tool factory building, more than 60% of the machine tools are automatic or semi-automatic. Working on the adjusted semi-automatic lathe for turning drill bits, the worker only needs to load the workpiece onto the machine tool and press the button. The machine tool will automatically rotate the workpiece, turn it to the required diameter, and cut the specified neck groove and tapered shank. After completing this process, it will automatically return the tool to the starting position, and the machine tool will stop, so that people can remove the completed workpiece and replace it with another one. One person can operate two such machine tools at the same time. As for those automatic machine tools, one person can operate as many as six at the same time. On that kind of machine tool, after adjusting the automatic drill bit milling machine, the worker only loads the turned blanks into the feeding rack batch by batch. The machine tool will automatically send the drill bit blank into the collet, automatically clamp it, and send it into the guide sleeve. Two special milling cutters, under four different rotational and linear movements, automatically mill a helical flute and a land at the same time according to the specifications on the drawing. After this work is completed, the milling cutter will automatically move away from the workpiece, and the drill bit blank will automatically and quickly exit the guide sleeve, rotate 180 degrees, and then automatically send it into the guide sleeve to complete the milling work of the second helical flute and land. After the milled drill bit automatically exits the guide sleeve, it falls into the abdomen of the machine tool. The feeding rack then automatically sends the second blank into the collet for processing. It works continuously in such a cycle, and the completed workpieces are sent out of the abdomen of the machine tool one by one.

    The optical profile grinders in the gauge workshop and the tool workshop can accurately grind the required curves on the templates. During the grinding process, the machine tool's precision optical system magnifies the workpiece fifty times and projects it onto the "screen." The worker manipulates two electric control knobs, and grinds the curve accurately on the template according to the enlarged curve on the "screen," just like tracing a drawing on the designed blueprint.

    In the two workshops of the measuring tool factory building, there are many highly precision machine tools. Those precision coordinate boring machines, gear hobbing machines, screw lathes, etc., are rare or have never existed in China before. There are also various scribing machines that do not look like machine tools, which can accurately scribe scales on measuring tools. The precision screw lathes and scribing machines are equipped with special adjustment devices to eliminate the errors caused by changes in indoor temperature.

    The semi-finished products of cutting tools and measuring tools are heated to a high temperature of 700 to 1200 degrees Celsius during the heat treatment process. However, there are no furnaces in the heat treatment workshop, only many vacuum tubes and induction coils. All heat treatment furnaces are heated by electricity. These electrical devices can "burn" the cold workpiece to a red-hot temperature in a few seconds. Those new high-temperature thermometers with electron tubes automatically and accurately record and control the heat treatment temperature, ensuring the quality of the heat treatment.

    The technological methods adopted in the production process are very advanced. It fully considers how to save expensive high-speed tool steel and improve product quality. For example, drill bits, taps, reamers, and other products generally stipulate the use of the "welded shank method," which can save 54% to 76% of expensive high-speed steel. Adding a "nitriding" process during the heat treatment of high-speed steel cutting tools can increase the surface hardness of the product and increase its cutting life by 30% to 150%.

    Precision Products, Strict Production Rules

    The products of the measuring & cutting tool plant are precision products. The unit of length we use in our daily life is the Shi Chi (Chinese foot). Three Shi Chi are equal to one meter. One-thousandth of a meter is called a millimeter. The unit of measurement in the mechanical manufacturing industry is the millimeter, which is about the diameter of the steel wire of a paper clip. In mechanical manufacturing, there is no absolutely accurate length. For example, when manufacturing a part that is 20 millimeters long, the so-called length of 20 millimeters cannot be without any error at all. Even if the difference is one-hundredth of a millimeter, one-thousandth of a millimeter, or even one ten-thousandth of a millimeter, there will still be a difference. How much difference is allowed is called "tolerance" in the terminology of mechanical manufacturing. The larger the tolerance of a product, the rougher it is, and the smaller the tolerance, the more precise it is. Tolerance represents the manufacturing precision.

    The tolerance requirement for cutting tools with higher precision is eight-thousandths of a millimeter. For example, for a hand reamer with a diameter of three millimeters, the error in its diameter cannot exceed this limit. Such a tolerance is considered relatively precise in mechanical manufacturing. This error is only one-tenth of the thickness of a People's Daily newspaper page. In the manufacture of measuring tools, the precision requirement is often much higher than this, and some are so precise that they cannot be imagined. For example, the length and parallelism errors of some high-grade gauges manufactured in the gauge workshop must not exceed seven ten-thousandths of a millimeter to fifteen ten-thousandths of a millimeter, which is only one-thousandth of the thickness of a People's Daily newspaper page.

    The manufacture of precision measuring tools is very difficult. In the gauge section of the gauge workshop, the indoor walls and ceilings are painted, and the floor is covered with cowhide. People must wear very white clothes to work. People must change shoes as soon as they enter the door. The worker’s hands must be certified by the hospital as non-sweating, because if the workpiece is stained with sweat, it will affect the quality. During production, the workpiece must be supported by cloth. If it is held by hand, the heat on the hand will increase the workpiece by one-thousandth to three-thousandths of a kilometer, while the error requirement for the workpiece's precision is five ten-thousandths of a kilometer. The indoor temperature, humidity, and dust must also be controlled by machines.

    Measuring and evaluating the precision of products is also very difficult, requiring more stringent working conditions and high-level precision measuring instruments. The indoor temperature of the highest-level metrology laboratory of the measuring & cutting tool plant is required to be constantly maintained at 20 degrees Celsius, not more than half a degree or less than half a degree. The relative humidity must be constantly maintained between 40% and 60%. The amount of dust in the indoor air must not exceed 0.0000005 kilograms per cubic meter. While maintaining these conditions, the indoor air must also be exchanged sixteen times per hour to ensure that the staff breathes enough fresh air. The staff here must wear specially prepared clean work clothes and shoes. People entering the room must abide by strict rules to avoid causing changes in working conditions. After the product to be measured is sent to the inspection room, it must wait until its temperature is the same as the indoor temperature before it can be measured, and during the measurement process, it must be prevented from being affected by the body temperature of the staff. The most precise optical wave interference comparator installed in this room has a minimum scale that can represent two ten-thousandths of a millimeter. How fine is this size? Assuming that the thickness of a certain paper can be as thin as two ten-thousandths of a millimeter (which is actually impossible), it would take four to five thousand sheets of this kind of paper stacked together to be as thick as a People's Daily newspaper!

    This is a beautiful factory with an excellent working environment and modern equipment. We must resolutely learn and implement advanced technological methods, ensure the quality of precision products, and only then will we not fail the great and comprehensive assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, and we will also be able to repay the concern and hope of the people of the whole country for us.

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂介绍
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂总工程师  韩云岑
    美丽的工厂，优良的劳动环境
    在哈尔滨，沿着宽阔的和平路走，你会看见在有名的哈尔滨亚麻厂的对面，耸立着一座八层楼的水塔。水塔的左面是一座办公大楼，右面是一座三层楼的厂房。不远处有一个喷水池，三根水柱不断地向空中射着银色的水花。围墙和栅栏把水塔、楼房、水池和附近的建筑物围起来。这些围墙、栅栏和建筑物都粉刷成淡黄色，镶嵌着白色的花纹。周围点缀着茂绿的树木。在秋高气爽的时节，这好像是一幅美丽的油画，吸引着成千成百的行人。这便是新建成的我国第一个制造精密工具的工厂——哈尔滨量具刃具厂。
    这个工厂的厂房内光线很充足。雪白的墙壁，土红色的地面，把簇新的蓝灰色的机器映照得格外分明。强有力的吸尘设备不断地把生产过程中所产生的尘屑吸去。完善的抽风系统把热加工车间的一些轻微的灰烟和气雾吸得干干净净。在冬天，优良的暖风系统使车间温暖如春。在热加工车间里，特别设计的冷风装置不断地把凉爽的空气送到工作地点，使工人们不感觉到炎热和疲倦。
    这个工厂共有四个主要厂房。它们是量具厂房、刃具厂房、木工厂房和工具修理厂房。为了进行必要的试验、研究和技术检查工作，工厂特设有试造车间、金相实验室、化验室、计量试验室和效能试验站。这些车间都已经先后开始试生产了。经过化验和金相检查的钢材，正在顺着既定生产路线，源源地由金属材料仓库流入生产车间。有些产品已经从最后一个工序出来，经过效能试验，挂上
  “合格”的标志。在不久的将来，从各个生产线的末端，将不断地吐出几千种规格的精密的量具和刃具。我们将在全国各地的机器制造厂里，看到这些刃具切削着成千累万吨的钢铁，把它们制成机器零件。看到这些量具在切削过程中，精密地测量着在制造中的机器零件，控制着它们的质量。
  现代化装备，先进的工艺方法
    这个工厂可以说是用世界上第一流的机器装备起来的。这里有苏联出厂编号的第一号机器，有苏联特别为我们设计制造的专用自动机床。在刃具厂房的钻头车间里，有百分之六十以上的机床都是自动的或者半自动的。在调整好的车制钻头的半自动车床上工作，工人只须把工作物装上机床，揿动电钮，机床便自动地转动工作物，把它车削至需要的直径，并且切削出规定的颈沟和斜柄。在完成这一工序后，又自动地让刀具回到开始的位置，机床的动作也停止了，以便人们将完成的工作物取下，换上另一个工作物。这样的机床一人可以同时操作两台。至于那些自动机床，一人可以同时操作六台之多。在那种机床上，把钻头自动铣床调整好以后，工人只把车制的毛坯一批一批地装入送料架，机床便自动地把钻头的毛坯送进卡簧，自动卡紧，送进导套。两把特制的铣刀，在四种不同的旋转和直线运动下，自动地按照图纸的规定同时铣出一个螺旋沟和一个刃背。在这一工作完成后，铣刀便自动地让开工作物，钻头毛坯自动地、快速地退出导套，旋转一百八十度，再自动地送进导套，完成第二个螺旋沟和刃背的铣制工作。铣好的钻头自动退出导套后落入机床的腹部。送料架接着便自动地把第二个毛坯送进卡簧，进行加工。如此循环连续的工作着，完成的工作物一个一个地从机床的腹部送出来。
    量规车间和工具车间的光学曲线磨床可以准确地在样板上磨出需要的曲线。在磨制的过程中，机床的精密的光学系统把工作物放大五十倍投影到“银幕”上。工人操纵着两个电动控制钮，根据“银幕”上放大的曲线，像在设计的图纸上描图一样，在样板上准确地磨出图纸上所规定的曲线。
    在量具厂房的两个车间里，有不少高度精密机床。那些精密的座标镗床、齿轮滚床、螺丝车床等等，都是国内少有或者以前未曾有过的。还有那些外观不像机床的各种刻线机，能精确地在量具上刻出尺度。精密的螺丝车床和刻线机上备有特别的调整装置，可以免除因室内温度的变化所产生的误差。
    刃具和量具的半成品在热处理的过程中被烧到摄氏七百到一千二百多度的高温。但是，在热处理车间里没有炉子，只有许多真空管和感应圈。全部热处理炉子是用电力加热的。这些电力装置能在几秒钟内，把冷的工作物“烧”到赤热的温度。那些具有电子管的新型高温温度表，自动地、准确地记录着和控制着热处理的温度，保证着热处理的质量。
    生产过程中所采用的工艺方法是十分先进的。它充分地考虑了如何节省高贵的高速工具钢和提高产品质量。例如钻头、丝锥、铰刀等产品普遍规定采用“焊柄方法”，可以节约高贵的高速钢百分之五十四到七十六。高速钢刃具在热处理时增加了一个“氮化”工序，可以增加产品的表面硬度，使它的切削寿命提高百分之三十到一百五十。
    精密的产品，严格的生产规律
    量具刃具厂的产品是精密的。我们日常生活用的长度单位是市尺。三市尺等于一公尺。一公尺的千分之一叫公厘。机械制造工业的计量单位是公厘，约等于夹纸的回形针的钢丝的直径。在机械制造方面，没有绝对准确的长度。例如制造一个二十公厘长的零件，所谓二十公厘的长度不可能是一点也不差的。那怕是差百分之一公厘，千分之一公厘，甚至万分之一公厘也是要差的。容许差多少在机械制造上的术语叫“公差”。一个产品的公差愈大就愈粗糙，愈小就愈精密。公差代表制造的精密度。
    刃具精密度要求较高的公差是千分之八公厘。例如一个三公厘直径的手铰刀，它的直径的误差不能超过这个限度。这样的公差在机械制造上算得是比较精密的了，这个误差只有人民日报纸张厚度的十分之一。在量具的制造上，精密度的要求常常比这要高得多，有的精密到不能想像。例如在量规车间制造的某些高级量规的长度和平行度误差不得超过十万分之七公厘到十万分之十五公厘，只有一张人民日报纸张厚度的千分之一。
    精密量具的制造是很困难的。在量规车间的量规工段里，室内墙壁和天花板都是油漆的，地板上铺着牛皮。人们都要穿十分洁白的衣服工作。人们一进门就要换鞋。工人的手必需经过医院证明是不出汗的，因为工作物沾上汗水就会影响质量。生产时工作物必须用布搁着，如果用手拿，那末手上的热度就会使工作物增大千分之一到千分之三公里，而工作物的精密度的误差要求则是万分之五公里。室内的温度、湿度、灰尘也要用机器来控制。
    测量和鉴定产品的精密度也是很困难的，需要更严格的工作条件和高级精密度的测量仪器。量具刃具厂的最高级的计量实验室的室内温度要求经常保持在摄氏表二十度，不能高过半度或低过半度。相对的湿度要经常保持在百分之四十到六十之间。室内空气的含灰尘量每立方公尺不得超过一千万分之五公斤。在保持这些条件的情况下，室内每小时还须换十六次空气，以保证工作人员吸到足够的新鲜空气。在这里的工作人员必须穿着特备的清洁的工作服和鞋子。入室的人员必须遵守严格的规律，以免引起工作条件的改变。受测量的产品被送到检验室后，必须等它的温度跟室内的温度相同时才能测量，而且在测量的过程中，又要防止受工作人员体温的影响。安装在这房间里的最精密的光波干涉比较仪，它的刻度最小可以代表十万分之二公厘。这个尺寸究竟有多细呢？假定有一种纸张的厚度能薄到十万分之二公厘（实际上是不可能的），要四五千张这种纸重叠起来才有一张人民日报那么厚！
    这是一个美丽的具有优良的劳动环境和现代化装备的工厂。我们必须坚决地学习和贯彻先进的工艺方法，保证精密的产品的质量，才不辜负苏联给予我们的伟大的、全面的援助，也才能报答全国人民对我们的关怀和希望。
