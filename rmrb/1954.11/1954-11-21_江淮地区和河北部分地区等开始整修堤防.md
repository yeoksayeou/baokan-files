In the Jianghuai area and parts of Hebei Province, which suffered from severe flooding this year, projects to repair and reinforce river dikes have commenced successively. Nearly one million laborers in Hubei and Hebei provinces have already started working on the dikes. In Hubei Province, the construction of dikes along the Yangtze and Han Rivers is actively underway. Vessels loaded with materials and stones of various sizes are frequently traveling on the Yangtze and Han Rivers. The dike construction project in Wuhan City has also begun. Along the dikes and riverbanks of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang, construction teams of over 20,000 people are working diligently with the fighting spirit of flood prevention, engaging in intense dike construction. In Hunan Province, after the smooth completion of various preparatory tasks, the Dongting Lake dike and polder restoration project has begun in some areas. As the river water levels recede slowly, the laborers are adopting the approach of repairing as they recede, and repairing polders as they recede, actively proceeding with construction. In Jiangxi Province, after the large-scale restoration project of embankments in the areas along the river and around the lake partially commenced, more than 50,000 laborers go to work on the dikes every day. In Hebei Province, by the beginning of November, the dike repair projects on the South Grand Canal, Ziya River, and Hutuo River had completed 1.9 million cubic meters of earthwork.

The State Council is deeply concerned about the work of breaching closures and dike restoration, and helping the flood victims return to their hometowns for production in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hebei provinces, which suffered from floods this year. During the planning process, the Ministry of Water Resources allocated more than 2 trillion yuan of special funds for breaching closures and dike restoration based on the restoration plans of various regions. With the support of the state, the people in various regions have a high enthusiasm for repairing dikes and restoring production. In Hubei Province, in the areas where the breaching closure project was completed by the end of October, more than 7.8 million mu of farmland have been drained, and farmers are busy planting winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed. In Anhui Province, after the breaching closures of Datong Erwei, Tongyiwei, and Tonglewei in Guichi County were completed, nearly 20,000 mu of farmland have been drained, and winter planting was completed six days ahead of schedule. More than 13,000 disaster victims in Tonglewei have returned to their hometowns for production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江淮地区和河北部分地区等开始整修堤防
    今年发生特大洪水的江淮地区和河北省部分地区，整修和加固江河堤防的工程已相继开工。湖北、河北两省已有近百万民工上堤。湖北省长江和汉水的堤防修筑工程，正积极施工。满载着器材和大小块石的船只，频繁地往来在长江和汉水的江面上。武汉市堤防修建工程也已开工。汉口、汉阳和武昌的沿江、沿河的堤防线上，两万多人的建筑队伍，正以防汛的战斗精神，紧张地进行堤防建设。湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程在顺利完成各项准备工作以后，部分地区已开始动工。江河水位下退迟缓，民工们便采取退一块、修一块，退一垸、修一垸的办法，积极施工。江西省沿江滨湖地区大规模的圩堤修复工程局部动工以后，每天就有五万多民工上堤工作。河北省南运河、子牙河、滹沱河等处河堤整修工程，至十一月上旬，已完成土方一百九十万公方。
    国务院对今年遭受水灾的湖北、湖南、安徽、江西和河北等地堵口复堤、帮助灾民回乡生产的工作十分关怀。在筹划过程中，水利部就根据各地修复计划，拨出了堵口复堤专款两万多亿元。各地人民得到国家支持，修复堤防和恢复生产的热情甚高。湖北省在十月底完成堵口工程的地区，已有七百八十多万亩农田排除积水，农民们正忙着播种小麦、油菜等冬种作物。安徽省贵池县大同二圩、同意圩和同乐圩溃口堵复后，已使近二万亩农田排除积水，提前六天完成冬种。同乐圩已有一万三千多灾民回乡生产。　（新华社）
