As the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel develops, Anshan City’s municipal construction has also made great progress this year. By the end of October, 110,000 square meters of asphalt roads and 50,000 square meters of macadam roads had been completed. At the same time, 2,100 meters of underground drainage culverts were completed, solving the drainage problem of rainwater and sewage in the Lishan District and thoroughly improving the environmental sanitation of the area. This year, in the new workers' residential areas of Taiping Village and Workers' Village, more than 800,000 trees have been planted along the roadsides and in squares, and many flowerbeds have been built, and more than 700 streetlights have been installed. In the past, only two narrow crossings and one bridge opening connected the east and west sides of the railway in Anshan city, which was very inconvenient for pedestrian traffic and cargo transportation. In May of this year, the Anshan Municipal People's Government began to build a reinforced concrete bridge from 219 Road in the Tie Dong District and Mao Zedong Road in the Tie Xi District. This bridge is 510 meters long and 18 meters wide. It has been welcomed by the majority of workers and staff, and the government has received more than 400 letters suggesting names for the bridge. This bridge will be completed around the 20th of this month, which will greatly facilitate urban transportation. At present, the construction of a gas storage tower is underway. It can hold 10,000 cubic meters of gas and will be completed next year. At that time, workers and staff in Taiping Village, Workers' Village and other places will be able to use gas.

    鞍山市政建设成绩显著
    随着鞍钢生产建设的发展，今年鞍山市的市政建设也有很大进展。到十月底，已完成了十一万平方公尺的柏油马路和五万平方公尺的碎石马路工程。同时完成了二千一百公尺的下水道暗渠工程，解决了立山区的雨水和污水的排泄问题，彻底改善了该地区的环境卫生。今年在新的工人住宅区太平村、工人村，马路两旁、广场等地栽植了八十多万株树木，并修建了许多花坛，安装了七百多盏路灯。过去连接鞍山市区铁路东、西的只有两条狭窄道口和一个桥洞，行人来往和货物运输很不方便，今年五月间鞍山市人民政府开始修建一座从铁东区的二一九路和铁西区毛泽东路的钢筋混凝土大桥。这座桥长五百一十公尺，宽十八公尺。它受到了广大职工的欢迎，政府曾收到了四百多封为这座桥题名的信件。这座桥，在这个月二十日左右即可竣工，将大大便利市内交通运输。目前，正在开始修建一座煤气贮藏塔。它可容量一万立方公尺的煤气，明年即可完工，那时太平村、工人村等地的职工，将可用上煤气了。（本报辽宁记者站）
