The Liushi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Dingzhai Township, Puyang County, Henan Province, was formed in December of last year. This autumn, it suffered a severe flood, and the morale of the cooperative members was very unstable. In order to reverse the pessimistic mood and mobilize the members to help themselves through production, Zhang Liming (a member of the Chinese Communist Party), the head of the cooperative, and others promptly convened a meeting of Party and Youth League members within the cooperative, calling on everyone to play a key leading role in production and self-help, and to lead the masses to overcome the disaster. Preliminary ideas for organizing sideline production were also studied. Then, a meeting of cooperative members was held. After discussion and research, a production self-help plan was formulated, and various activities were actively carried out separately. Seeing that organization offered a way to overcome disaster, 54 peasant households around the cooperative requested to join the Liushi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, which expanded from the original 17 households to 71 households.

After the expansion of the Liushi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, the sideline production plan was further revised, and sideline activities were carried out more extensively. All 76 laborers in the cooperative were organized into various agricultural and sideline production teams according to their specialties, and agricultural and sideline production was carried out separately. Now, not only is there a lot of income from sideline production, but agricultural production is also doing very well. The original plan was to plant 950 mu of wheat, and by October 10th, 60% had been planted (the remaining part had not yet been sown due to the soft and wet ground at the time). The remarkable achievements in agricultural and sideline production have made the members more deeply aware of the superiority of being organized and strengthened their confidence in helping themselves through production. The members generally believe that overcoming the disaster is not a problem.

    河南省濮阳县六市农业生产合作社
    在和灾荒作斗争中得到巩固和发展
    河南濮阳县丁砦乡六市农业生产合作社是去年十二月组成的，今年秋季遭受了严重的水灾，社员情绪很波动。为了扭转悲观情绪，发动社员生产自救，该社社长张黎明（中共党员）等及时召开了社内党团员会议，号召大家在生产自救中起骨干带头作用，领导群众战胜灾荒。并研究出组织副业生产的初步意见。然后召开社员大会，经过讨论研究，制定了生产自救计划，并分头积极进行各项活动。周围群众看到组织起来有办法战胜灾荒，便有五十四户农民要求参加六市农业生产合作社，该社便由原来的十七户扩大到七十一户。
    六市农业生产合作社扩大后，进一步修订了副业生产计划，副业活动也就更加广泛的开展起来。全社七十六个劳动力，按特长组成各种农、副业小组，分头进行农、副业生产。现在不仅副业方面有了很多收入，农业生产也搞得很好。原计划种麦九百五十亩，到十月十日已种了百分之六十（其余部分因当时地皮湿软，尚未播种）。农副业生产的显著成绩，使社员更深刻的体会到组织起来的优越性，坚定了生产自救的信心，社员们普遍认为战胜灾荒没有问题。
