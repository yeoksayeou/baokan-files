    [This report] According to reports, by the end of the third quarter, 163 construction units in Liaoning Province (excluding Anshan Iron and Steel) had saved 143.9 billion yuan in construction funds. This year, all construction units have attached importance to reducing project costs and have generally formulated plans to reduce costs. In the work of reducing costs, all units pay attention to promoting advanced experience, mobilize workers to carry out technological innovation, and rationally use construction materials. For example, workers at the Second Branch of Fushun Thermal Power Company created a tipping machine to replace manual transportation, increasing labor efficiency by one time; using a sand and gravel machine to replace manual sawing of asbestos cement boards increased efficiency by six times; and using powder grinding to replace asbestos sawdust. These three technological innovations alone saved 69 million yuan by the end of August. Dalian Civil Engineering Company adopted a rational plumbing design, shortened pipeline distances, and used cement pipes instead of black iron pipes, saving 400 million yuan on one plumbing project alone.

    To date, many units have exceeded or met their cost reduction plans on schedule. The Second and Third Companies of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau had reduced project costs by 10.6 billion yuan by early November. Among the construction sites under the two companies, seven sites, including 220 and 221, have exceeded their planned cost reduction targets. The actual reduction in project costs for the First Ministry of Machine Building's project in Fushun has exceeded the plan by 17.2 percent. The Fushun Petroleum Construction and Installation Engineering Company, due to the full use of existing equipment and the promotion of advanced experience, actually saved funds equivalent to 19.3 percent of the total project cost, greatly exceeding the savings target.

    While reducing project costs, all units have paid attention to overcoming the phenomenon of stockpiling construction materials. With the assistance of the Liaoning Provincial Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, 47 construction units have reviewed and reduced their material purchase plans, reducing the value of materials by more than 60 billion yuan. Each unit also mutually adjusted materials worth more than 200 billion yuan. The Shenyang Wire Factory project alone, after investigating inventory materials and carefully calculating accounts, reduced its material purchase plan by 9 billion yuan. The Fushun 301 Factory project disposed of 9 billion yuan of stockpiled materials in September, ensuring the supply of project funds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. In order to support industrial construction, factories, government agencies, stores, and residents in Wuhan are actively conserving electricity. In October, the city saved more than 770,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which can be used to smelt more than 25,000 tons of steel. Due to saving on electricity for lighting alone, the peak night load of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau was reduced by 2,500 kilowatts, which is enough electricity to supply the entire electricity consumption of a factory with 80,000 spindles.

    Wuhan's conservation of electricity for lighting began in early July. To support the drainage of waterlogged areas in the suburbs at that time, Wuhan established a central group for conserving electricity for lighting, leading electricity users throughout the city to replace large light bulbs with small light bulbs, without affecting normal work, study, and life, and strictly prohibiting the use of electric stoves, electric irons, and neon lights, etc.; in the third quarter, more than 1.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved. After the flood control, various agencies strictly managed electricity expenses on the original basis, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce also conducted equipment registration among merchants to prevent the continued waste of electricity. In October, more than 450,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved.

    Starting in September, factories also established central groups for conserving power consumption for production under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Planning Commission, eliminating waste in production power consumption and improving equipment to reduce power consumption. The central group first focused on the joint state-private Shenxin Yarn Factory for measurement. Originally, the Shenxin Yarn Factory allowed the motors to idle during nighttime work stoppages for meals. By stopping the motors, more than 13,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved each month; in addition, improving the friction of the steel wire car's circle bar disk and vertical shaft can save more than 3,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity each month. Because the central group assisted in implementing 15 energy-saving measures, Shenxin Yarn Factory saved more than 60,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in October. The central group also promoted the experience of Shenxin Yarn Factory to factories throughout the city, and, targeting the phenomenon of excessively large transformers and power equipment in various factories, carried out city-wide equipment adjustments, removing 3,000 kilovolt-amperes of transformers and 780 horsepower of motors. In October, a total of more than 320,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved for power. As a result, the costs of the factories were also reduced.

    辽宁一百多个建筑单位节约资金千余亿元
    武汉市十月份节约用电七十七万多度
    【本报讯】辽宁省一百六十三个建筑单位（不包括鞍钢），到第三季度末已节约建设资金一千四百三十九亿元。各建筑单位今年都重视降低工程成本的工作，普遍制定了降低成本的计划。在降低成本工作中，各单位注意推广先进经验，发动工人进行技术革新，合理使用建筑器材。如抚顺火电公司第二分公司工人创造翻斗机，代替了人工运输，提高劳动效率一倍；利用砂石机代替人工锯石绵板，提高效率六倍；采用磨粉加工代替石绵锯沫，仅这三项技术革新，到八月底就节约了六千九百万元。大连土建公司采用合理的水暖设计，缩短管道距离，并用水泥管代替黑铁管，仅在一项水暖工程上就节约了四亿元。
    到目前止，许多单位都超额或按期实现了降低成本的计划。沈阳市建筑工程局第二、第三两公司，到十一月初旬已降低工程成本一百零六亿元。两个公司所属的工地中，有二二○、二二一等七个工地，都超过了预定的降低成本指标。第一机械工业部在抚顺的工程，实际降低工程成本数字已经超过计划百分之十七点二。抚顺石油建筑安装工程公司，由于充分利用工程原有设备和推广先进经验，实际节约资金等于工程总价百分之十九点三，大大超过了节约指标。
    在降低工程成本的同时，各单位都注意克服积压建筑器材的现象。在中国人民建设银行辽宁省分行协助下，有四十七个建筑单位，都审核和削减了购买材料计划，核减材料价值达六百多亿元。各单位并且互相调剂了价值达两千多亿元的器材。仅沈阳电线厂一个工程，经调查库存材料，算细账后，就核减了九十亿元的材料购入计划。抚顺三○一厂工程，九月份处理了九十亿元积压材料，保证了工程资金的供应。
    【本报武汉二十二日电】为了支援工业建设，武汉市工厂、机关、商店和居民积极节约用电。十月份全市节约了七十七万多度电，用这些电可以冶炼两万五千多吨钢。单是因为节约照明用电，武汉冶电业局的夜间高峰负荷降低了二千五百瓩，这些电力足够供应八万纱锭工厂的全部用电。
    武汉市节约照明用电，是从七月初开始的。为了支援当时郊区排除渍水，武汉市成立了节约照明用电中心小组，领导全市用电户在不影响正常工作、学习和生活的原则下，将大灯泡换成小灯泡，并严格禁用电炉、电熨斗和霓虹灯等；在第三季共节约用电一百六十多万度。防汛结束后，各机关即在原有基础上，严格管理用电经费，工商联合会也在商户中进行用电设备登记，防止浪费电的现象继续发生，十月份又节约了四十五万多度电。
    从九月份起，各工厂也在武汉市计划委员会领导下成立了节约动力用电中心小组，消灭生产用电上的浪费现象，并改进设备降低电耗。中心小组首先以公私合营申新纱厂为重点进行测定。申新纱厂原来夜间停工吃饭时还让电动机空转，后来将电动机停下，每月即可节约用电一万三千多度；此外，改善了钢丝车上圈条盘和直立轴的磨擦，每月即可节约三千二百多度电。由于中心小组协助实现了十五项节约用电的措施，申新纱厂十月份便节约用电六万多度。中心小组又将申新纱厂的经验向全市各厂推广，并针对各厂变压器和动力设备过大的现象，进行全市设备调整，拆除了三千千伏的变压器和七百八十马力的电动机，十月份共节约了动力用电三十二万多度。各厂成本也因此降低。
