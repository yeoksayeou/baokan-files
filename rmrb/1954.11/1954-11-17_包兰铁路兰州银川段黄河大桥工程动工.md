Construction Begins on Yellow River Bridge for Baotou-Lanzhou Railway's Lanzhou-Yinchuan Section

[This Newspaper] Report: Construction on the Yellow River Bridge for the Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway began on November 8th. Preparatory work for the 130-li railway construction going north from Lanzhou is also fully underway.

The Yellow River Bridge is the first major project for the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway heading north from Lanzhou. Once completed, this bridge will be one of the largest arch bridges in our country. Before construction began, the winches and generators for bridge building were installed, an overhead cable line was erected across the Yellow River, and gantry cranes for pile driving were also installed. After construction began, bridge builders worked day and night on the surging Yellow River. On November 8th and 9th, positioning piles for the No. 2 pier were driven. Workers are now driving guide piles, and winter construction will begin soon. They will take advantage of the Yellow River's low water season to complete the underwater work of the bridge.

In the preparatory work for road construction, by the end of October, the telecommunications project had completed 42 kilometers of wiring, and nearly 4,000 cubic meters of stone for road construction had been quarried. During the construction of access roads for transporting materials, youth shock brigades in the Third Construction Area launched a labor emulation drive, increasing the planned work rate from 4.35 cubic meters per worker to 8.9 cubic meters, saving the country nearly 100 million yuan. Farmers along the route are actively supporting this road construction project. Farmers have leased nearly 20,000 rooms to construction workers for housing, and more than 2,000 civilian laborers have participated in the road construction preparation project.

    包兰铁路兰州银川段黄河大桥工程动工
    【本报讯】包兰铁路兰（州）银（川）段黄河大桥工程已在十一月八日开工。由兰州北去的一百三十里铁路施工准备工程也全面展开。
    黄河大桥是包兰铁路由兰州北去的第一个重要工程。这座大桥建成后，将是我国最大的拱桥之一。开工前，修桥用的卷扬机、发电机已经装好，黄河上空架起了跨河天线，还装好了打桩用的龙门架。开工后，筑桥工人们在波浪滚滚的黄河面上日夜进行施工。十一月八日、九日两天已打好了二号桥墩的定位桩。现在工人们正在打导桩，不久就要进行冬季施工。他们将趁黄河枯水季节修好大桥的水下工程。
    在筑路的准备工程中，到十月底，电讯工程已经完成四十二公里的架线工作，修路用的石料已经开采了近四千方。在修筑为施工运输材料的便道时，第三工区青年突击队员们展开劳动竞赛，由计划工率每工四点三五方提高到八点九方，为国家增产节约近一亿元。沿线农民积极支援这段修路工程。农民们已租让出近两万间房屋给筑路工人居住，并有两千多名民工参加了筑路准备工程。
