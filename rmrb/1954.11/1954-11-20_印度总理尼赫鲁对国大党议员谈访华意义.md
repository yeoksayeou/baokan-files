Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 19th: According to reports in Delhi newspapers, Indian Prime Minister Nehru elaborated on the historical significance of his visit to China and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India at a meeting of Congress Party members of the Indian Parliament on the 17th. He said that his visit should not be seen as a personal trip with lavish receptions but should be assessed in terms of its impact on Asian history.

Prime Minister Nehru said: What is important is that two Asian countries, which together account for one-third of the world's population, are more closely united. The friendship between these two countries will not only help establish peace in Asia but also help establish peace throughout the world.

Nehru reiterated the importance of the Five Principles expounded in the joint statement issued by him and Premier Zhou Enlai. He said that only on this basis can relations between countries in Asia and other regions develop in the interests of lasting peace.

Referring to the situation in Taiwan, Prime Minister Nehru said that the Chinese people hold a firm attitude on the Taiwan issue. He pointed out that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation have recognized that Taiwan belongs to China.

Nehru also said that he was particularly impressed by the speed of China's progress in national development plans. He was also deeply impressed by the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for the various projects undertaken by the government.

    印度总理尼赫鲁对国大党议员谈访华意义
    【新华社新德里十九日电】据德里报纸报道，印度总理尼赫鲁十七日在印度国会国大党议员的会议上阐述他访问中国以及中国总理周恩来访问印度的历史意义。他说，他的这次访问不应当被看作是受到隆重招待的一次个人旅行，应该从这次访问对亚洲历史的影响方面来估量它的价值。
    尼赫鲁总理说：重要的是拥有世界人口三分之一的两个亚洲国家更紧密地团结在一起了。这两个国家的友谊不仅有助于建立亚洲和平，而且有助于建立全世界的和平。
    尼赫鲁再度强调他和周恩来总理发表的联合声明中所阐述的五项原则的重要性。他说，只有在这个基础上，亚洲和其他地区的国家之间的关系才能按照持久和平的利益发展。
    尼赫鲁总理在谈到台湾的局势时说，中国人民对台湾问题抱强硬态度。他指出，开罗宣言和波茨坦公告已承认台湾属于中国。
    尼赫鲁又说，中国在国家发展计划方面进展的速度给他留下特别深刻的印象。中国人民对于政府进行的各项工程的热情也使他有很深的印象。
