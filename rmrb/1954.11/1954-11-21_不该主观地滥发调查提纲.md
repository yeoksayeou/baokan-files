Reaction to Criticism and Suggestions

    Should Not Subjectively and Indiscriminately Issue Investigation Outlines
    Letter from the CPC Guangyuan Central County Committee of Sichuan Province: We have checked the criticism in the People's Daily on August 16th regarding our issuance of an investigation outline during the spring plowing season, stating that the time limit was tight and the requirements were too high, which hindered production. We believe it is completely appropriate.
    The reason for the aforementioned erroneous facts is mainly that we committed the mistake of subjectivism. At the time, our purpose in issuing this investigation outline was to study how to improve current agricultural production in mountainous areas and the long-term construction of mountainous areas. Therefore, the content was extensive. In terms of method, we originally required that the existing data from each county be collected and systematically organized first, combined with an investigation of one township or one village in conjunction with leading spring plowing production, in order to comprehensively understand the political and economic panorama of the mountainous area. However, we did not consider the actual methods and abilities of cadres in combining work. At the time, when spring plowing began, although we urged all counties to mobilize all cadres to fully lead production, when considering the cadres for investigation in each county, we believed that it would not hinder production if the offices of each county transferred one or two people to collect and organize materials, and we neglected the resulting loss of focus of the key township cadres' leadership energy. When we issued the outline on April 20th requiring the completion of the investigation report by May 20th, we estimated that one month was not short, but we neglected the delay caused by the round-trip time for sending and receiving documents. In short, at that time, we started from subjective wishes and did not carefully consider the objective situation of the cadres in each county at the time, which resulted in the aforementioned errors. This is precisely the consequence of subjectivism. We accept the lessons of this incident and, in future work, first, we must further strengthen our studies and improve our Marxist-Leninist theoretical level to thoroughly overcome subjectivism; second, we must deeply understand the actual situation, carefully study and analyze the current objective situation, and do our work well.

### 不该主观地滥发调查提纲

    不该主观地滥发调查提纲
    中共四川省广元中心县委员会来信：八月十六日人民日报对于我们在春耕中发出调查提纲，时限紧迫，要求过高，以致妨碍生产的批评，经过检查，我们认为完全恰当。
    产生上述错误事实的原因，主要是我们犯了主观主义的毛病。当时我们发出这个调查提纲的目的，是为了研究如何改进当前山区的农业生产和长期建设山区的问题，因而内容广泛。在方法上原要求先就各县现有资料搜集起来系统整理，结合领导春耕生产调查一个乡或一个村的情况，以便全面了解山区政治、经济的全貌。但是没有考虑到干部在结合工作上的实际方法和能力。当时春耕开始，我们虽则督促各县动员全体干部全力领导生产，但在考虑各县调查的干部时，又认为各县办公室抽调一、二人搜集整理材料不会妨碍生产，而忽略了因此所引起的重点乡干部对领导精力的分散所造成的损失。在四月二十日发出提纲要求五月二十日完成调查报告，当时估计一月的时间不短，而忽略了发文路途往返延误时间。总之，当时凭主观愿望出发，没有慎重地考虑当时各县干部的客观情况，以致产生了上述错误，这正是主观主义所造成的后果。我们接受这件事情的教训，在今后工作中，第一、要进一步加强学习，提高我们的马克思列宁主义理论水平，彻底地克服主观主义；第二、深入了解实际，细心研究分析当前的客观情况，做好工作。
