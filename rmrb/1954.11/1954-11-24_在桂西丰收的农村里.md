    In early November, during the busy autumn harvest and planting season, we visited the rural areas on the western border of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Farmers of all ethnic groups were harvesting, plowing, and planting winter crops, creating a scene of intense activity in the fields.

    From Ningming County in the southern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to Mubiang County in the west bordering Yunnan Province, this long border line has undulating hills and small valley plains, inhabited by Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Dai, Han and other ethnic groups. From Ningming, we passed through the "Fanbao Ridge" of the Shiwan Mountain Range, stood on the towering Mutnanguan Mountain, or in Mubian bordering Yunnan, we could see golden rice fields everywhere, lush green wheat seedlings, and autumn buckwheat with white flowers blooming. In the rice fields, farmers of all ethnic groups are harvesting, and some farmers are plowing the rice fields that have just been harvested.

    In the Liqi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the first district of Ningming County, the loudspeaker rings around the entire village every day at dawn. Men carry plows and lead oxen to the fields to plow and plant winter crops, while women carry sickles and baskets to harvest. On moonlit nights, you can still hear the sound of threshing in the fields.

    Farmers of all ethnic groups have once again achieved a bumper harvest this year. Mubiang County has had the best rice harvest this year in decades, with the county producing more than 9 million catties more than last year. According to statistics from 7,233 mutual aid teams in Jingxi County, this year's production increased by 21 to 22 percent compared to last year, and the average production increase of 40 agricultural production cooperatives reached about 52 percent. Individual farmers have also generally achieved bumper harvests. During the harvest, farmers in many areas improved their harvesting techniques, carefully threshed and harvested, and strived to bring every grain home. Mubiang County improved its harvesting techniques and harvested more than 1,489,000 catties of grain throughout the county.

    This year, under the leadership of the Communist Party, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have changed their past habit of not planting winter crops, formulated winter planting plans, and some have already begun winter planting.

    在桂西丰收的农村里
    新华社记者　李益芳　黄义杰
    十一月初，正当秋收下种时节，我们访问了广西省桂西僮族自治区西部边境的农村。各族农民正在收割、翻土和进行冬种，田野里呈现一片紧张的气象。
    从桂西僮族自治区南部的宁明县到西部和云南省接壤的睦边县，在这漫长的边境线上有绵亘起伏的山岗，也有一块块狭小的山谷平原，居住着僮、苗、瑶、傣、汉等各族人民。我们由宁明走过十万大山支脉的“饭包岭”，站在巍峨的睦南关山头，或在和云南接界的睦边，到处都看得见金黄色的稻田，绿油油的麦苗，和正在开放着白花的秋种荞麦。在稻田里，各族农民正在收割，有的农民在刚收完庄稼的稻田里翻土。
    在宁明县第一区的礼舣乡农业生产合作社，每天天刚拂晓，广播筒就在全村周围响起来了。男人们背着犁头，牵着耕牛去田间翻土冬种，妇女们拿着镰刀、挑着箩筐去收割。在有月光的晚上，还听到人们在场子上的打谷声。
    各族农民今年又一次获得了丰收。睦边县今年的稻谷是几十年未有的好收成，全县比去年增产九百多万斤。靖西县据七千二百三十三个互助组的统计，今年比去年增产百分之二十一到二十二，四十个农业生产合作社平均增产达百分之五十二左右。单干农民也普遍得到丰收。在收割中，许多地区的农民改进了收割技术，精打细收，争取颗粒还家，睦边县因改进了收割技术，全县就多收了一百四十八万九千多斤粮食。
    今年各地的农业生产合作社、互助组在共产党组织的领导下，改变过去不冬种的习惯，订出了冬种计划，有的已经开始冬种。
