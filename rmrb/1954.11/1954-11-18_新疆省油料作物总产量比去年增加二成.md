Xinjiang Province's total oilseed crop output this year is expected to reach over 133 million jin, an increase of 20% compared to last year. To complete this year's oilseed crop planting plan, various regions, without reducing grain crops and appropriately expanding cotton fields, have used cultivated land to plant oilseed crops. They also utilized sandy waste, dry land, heavy stubble, and field edges to plant sunflowers, safflower, castor beans, etc., exceeding the planned target by 8.8%. This year, various regions also paid attention to improving cultivation and management techniques for oilseed crops. In the past, flax was often planted continuously for many years, resulting in severe diseases and pests, low yields, and particularly heavy depletion of soil fertility. This year, in addition to changing continuous cropping practices, carefully selecting seeds, sowing early, and strengthening field management, various regions have also switched to planting higher-yielding rapeseed in greater numbers. The province's rapeseed planting area this year increased by more than 45% compared to last year. Regarding sunflower planting, the area not only increased more than twofold compared to last year, but many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams also paid attention to seed selection and field management. This year, major oilseed crop areas have achieved bumper harvests. The total output in Urumqi, Changji, and Yili has exceeded last year's by 40% to 80%, while Hami and Altay have more than doubled last year's output.

    新疆省油料作物总产量比去年增加二成
    新疆省油料作物的总产量今年可达一亿三千三百多万斤，比去年增产百分之二十。为了完成今年油料作物播种计划，各地在不减少粮食作物和适当扩大棉田的情况下，除用熟地种植油料外，并利用沙荒、旱地、重槎及田边等隙地种植向日葵、红花、蓖麻等，超额完成了预定计划百分之八点八。今年各地也注意改进油料作物的栽培管理技术。过去各地种胡麻往往多年连作，因而病虫害严重，产量很低，而且耗费地力特别厉害；今年各地除改变连作、精选种籽，提早播种和加强田间管理等技术措施外，并且还多改种产量高的油菜。全省今年油菜的种植面积比去年扩大了百分之四十五强。各地对向日葵的种植，不仅面积比去年增加了一倍以上，许多农业生产合作社和互助组并注意选种和田间管理工作。今年主要油料作物区都获得了丰产。乌鲁木齐、昌吉、伊犁等地的总产量都超过去年百分之四十至八十，哈密和阿勒泰两地超过去年的一倍以上。
