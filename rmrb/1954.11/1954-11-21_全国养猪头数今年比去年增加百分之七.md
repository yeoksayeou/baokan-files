This year, China's pig raising industry has seen new development. It is estimated that the total number of pigs nationwide will reach 100,360,000, an increase of approximately seven percent compared to last year. Sichuan Province, the largest pig producing area, has increased its pig numbers to over 20,060,000 this year. Guangdong Province has increased to over 8,000,000. Hunan Province has increased to over 6,000,000. Fujian Province has increased to over 2,500,000. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, each farming household has an average of one and a half pigs. The pigs produced in China are mostly sold domestically, with only about two percent being exported. In Jinhua Special District, Zhejiang Province, due to the increase in pigs, the district's pork consumption in the first half of this year increased by 17.6 percent compared to the same period last year. In addition to meeting the needs of the local people and exporting some pigs, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region transported 8,130 pigs and 928,900 catties of pork to cities such as Beijing and Tianjin from January to June 20 this year.

    全国养猪头数今年比去年增加百分之七
    今年我国养猪业有新的发展，预计全国猪只可达到一亿零三十六万头，比去年增加约百分之七。产猪最多的四川省，今年猪只已增加到二千零六万多头。广东省已增加到八百多万头。湖南省已增加到六百多万头。福建省已增加到二百五十多万头。内蒙古自治区平均每个农户有一只半猪。我国出产的猪只，除了大约百分之二强的数目供出口外，绝大部分是内销。浙江省金华专区由于猪的增殖，今年上半年全专区猪肉消费量比去年同期增加了百分之十七点六。内蒙古自治区除供应当地人民需要和部分出口的猪只外，今年一月到六月二十日运销北京、天津等城市的猪只达八千一百三十头、猪肉九十二万八千九百多斤。　（新华社）
