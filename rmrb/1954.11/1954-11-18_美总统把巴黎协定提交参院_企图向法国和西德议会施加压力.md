Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 17th: U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a message to the U.S. Senate on the 15th, requesting the Senate to ratify the protocol on ending the "occupation regime" of West Germany and the protocol on West Germany's accession to the North Atlantic Group, both signed in Paris in October. These are two of the documents concerning the arming of West Germany signed at the Paris conference that need to be submitted to the Senate for ratification. Eisenhower pointed out in his message that after the protocol on ending the "occupation regime" of West Germany comes into effect, the United States, Britain, and France will still retain the right to station troops in West Germany. He said that the purpose of these agreements is to enable West Germany's "military forces to be merged with the military forces of other Atlantic Group countries, so that Germany's contribution of military forces will be developed and used according to common needs." He requested the Senate to take swift action on the issue of ratifying the above two protocols when it convenes in January next year.

News reports indicate that Eisenhower's move is intended to exert pressure on Western European countries, especially the French and West German parliaments, to quickly ratify the Paris Accords.

    美总统把巴黎协定提交参院
    企图向法国和西德议会施加压力
    【新华社十七日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔十五日向美国参议院提出咨文，要求参议院批准十月间在巴黎签订的所谓结束对西德“占领制度”议定书和吸收西德参加北大西洋集团议定书。这是在巴黎会议上签订的关于武装西德的一系列协定中需要提交参议院批准的两个文件。艾森豪威尔在咨文中指出，在所谓结束对西德“占领制度”议定书生效后，美、英、法三国仍保持有在西德驻扎军队的权利。他说，这些协定的目的是使西德的“军事力量将同大西洋集团其他国家的军事力量合并起来，使得德国贡献的军事力量根据共同的需要发展和使用”。他要求参议院在明年一月开会时迅速就批准上述两个议定书问题采取行动。
    消息透露，艾森豪威尔采取这个措施，用意在向西欧国家，特别是法国和西德议会施加压力，要它们迅速批准巴黎协定。
