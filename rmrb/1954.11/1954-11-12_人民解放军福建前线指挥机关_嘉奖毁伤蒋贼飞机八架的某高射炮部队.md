Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, November 11th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front Command issued a commendation order on the 4th to a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit for shooting down two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and damaging six others, and killing Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Squadron Leader Chen Kang, in an air battle on the 1st.

The commendation order pointed out: At 12:45 on the 1st, four batches of Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, totaling fifteen sorties, invaded the airspace over the Tong'an area of Fujian Province to conduct repeated bombings. Our anti-aircraft artillery unit immediately launched a fierce and accurate attack on the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. In the forty-five-minute battle, we achieved significant results with only a small amount of ammunition expended. This air battle resulted in the downing and damaging of more than 53 percent of the total number of attacking Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.

The commendation order pointed out: The main reasons for achieving this significant victory are that this anti-aircraft artillery unit resolutely implemented the orders of its superiors, made full combat preparations in advance, and that all commanders and fighters fought bravely and tenaciously with skillful shooting and command.

The commendation order finally encouraged this anti-aircraft artillery unit to make persistent efforts and strive for even greater victories.
