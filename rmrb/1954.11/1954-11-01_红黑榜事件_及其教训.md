The "Red and Black List Incident" and Its Lessons
	Wang Min, Secretary of the CPC Mei Shan County Committee, Sichuan Province
	In July of this year, the masses in Mei Shan County, Sichuan Province, exposed a "Red and Black List" incident: near a public notice issued by the Mei Shan County People's Court sentencing the counter-revolutionary element, bandit, and murderer Jin Yu-cheng to imprisonment, there was also posted a glorious red list of Jin Yu-cheng being selected as a county agricultural labor model. The red and black lists bore the same person's name, and in fact, it was the same person.

	How did this happen? How did such an absurd event occur?

	Jin Yu-cheng was from Shizi Village, Taihe Township, Second District, Mei Shan County. Before liberation, he killed his younger brother, Jin Lao San; in the early days of liberation, he hid bandits and colluded with habitual bandit Quan Shao-hua and others to kill a farmer in Baima Township, Seventh District of the county. In April 1952, during the land reform, after being accused by the victim's family, the Mei Shan County People's Court sentenced the principal offender Quan Shao-hua to death, and other accomplices were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. At that time, because Jin Yu-cheng confessed the truth of the case, and the case handler at the time, Yu Shu-ying (a retained employee), believed that Jin Yu-cheng was not the principal offender, Jin was allowed to return home on bail before sentencing. However, on April 22 of the same year, when the sentence of two years imprisonment for Jin was formally announced, the court did not summon Jin to court. When Yu Shu-ying was transferred from the court in the same year and handed over the case files, she did not explain to the receiving clerk, Yao Shang-qing, that Jin was not in custody; due to the serious bureaucracy of the leading cadres of the County People's Court, this situation was not corrected for a long time, and Jin remained at large. It was not until November 26, 1953, when Quan Shao-hua was executed by shooting, that the County People's Court discovered that Jin had not been arrested. At that time, although the person in charge of the County People's Court had said that he would send someone to arrest Jin, the court never sent anyone to arrest him, and the person in charge of the court did not continue to investigate afterward.

	During the period of "returning home to produce" and remaining at large, Jin used the complacency of the district and township cadres, pretended to be active in the village, and gained the trust of the leading cadres by deception. The original Deputy District Chief Tao Zhong-hua, who was guiding the work locally, did not go deep into the work or work in a down-to-earth manner. On the surface, he saw that Jin was eloquent and that his wheat yield was relatively high, so he thought "this person is not bad," so that Jin was able to mix into the mutual aid group and eventually steal the leading position of the deputy leader of the mutual aid group. At this time, the masses had reported Jin's evil deeds to Tao Zhong-hua, but he was still not vigilant. Instead, under the control of bourgeois individualism and the pursuit of honors, he violated the conditions indicated by the County Party Committee for the selection of labor models, and regarded Jin as a labor model "object" to "cultivate," wanting to win some "glory" for the work in this area. In March 1953, Tao Zhong-hua was transferred, and Jin continued to be "cultivated" by the current Deputy District Chief Peng Yuan-qing. In October of the same year, the work of selecting labor models began; although Peng Yuan-qing also heard cadres report that Jin had political problems, he subjectively believed that the cadres who reported the situation had "personal opinions" with Jin, and at the same time, he was afraid that "the labor model he cultivated would collapse, and he would lose face." Therefore, he adopted a dishonest attitude and arbitrarily determined that Jin was a wheat bumper harvest model and reported it to the higher authorities. In December of the same year, the county notified each district to report the deeds of labor models. Peng Yuan-qing immediately asked the township clerk to fill in the form and indicated that Jin was "discussed and evaluated by the mass meeting and group meeting..." and reported it. In March of this year, when the county leading organs were reviewing the materials of labor models, they found that the model facts of Jin were not specific and returned them twice in succession, asking the Second District People's Government to send someone to conduct on-the-spot investigations and mobilize the masses to seriously and democratically evaluate. However, they never sent anyone to conduct on-the-spot investigations or organized the masses to hold meetings for discussion. The leaders of the Second District People's Government twice asked the clerks of the District People's Government and Township People's Government to slightly supplement some materials and sent them back to the County People's Government. The county's labor model review committee only focused on reviewing the yield per mu and relaxed the review of the political composition of the labor model himself. In addition, the Deputy Secretary of the Second District Committee and the former District Chief of the Second District, who participated in the review at the time, did not provide Jin Yu-cheng's political situation. As a result, Jin Yu-cheng was mistakenly evaluated as a labor model and attended the county labor model conference.

	In March of this year, after the "honor list" of the counter-revolutionary element Jin Yu-cheng being evaluated as a labor model was posted in various villages, it aroused the surprise and dissatisfaction of the masses in Taihe Township. The masses said: "Jin Yu-cheng falsely reported the acreage and yield!" "Who selected this model!" A rural assessor in Taihe Township, Second District, immediately reported this situation to the County People's Government. The County People's Government then arrested Jin in late April.

	The occurrence of the "Red and Black List incident" has caused serious damage to the work and prestige of the Party and the government. This is the most acute criticism and the most profound education for our county and district leaders. Now the "Red and Black List incident" has been dealt with: the CPC Mei Shan County Committee and relevant cadres have publicly made self-criticisms to the masses; some cadres have been given disciplinary actions within the Party; the counter-revolutionary element Jin Yu-cheng has been arrested and sentenced, and his title of labor model has been revoked, basically reversing the adverse impact. However, the lessons of this incident will be forever remembered in our hearts. The lessons of this incident are:

	1. We must strengthen the revolutionary legal system concept of county and district cadres and improve the understanding of county and district cadres on the complexity and acuteness of class struggle during the transition period. After studying the general task and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, the political consciousness of the county and district cadres has been improved, but due to insufficient understanding of the more complex situation of class struggle during the transition period, and believing that after the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the world would be peaceful from then on, complacency and pacifist ideas have arisen in the work, and revolutionary vigilance has been lost. Coupled with the excessive lack of revolutionary legal system concepts, this has enabled the counter-revolutionary murderer Jin Yu-cheng to be free from legal sanctions for a long time.

	2. We must constantly strengthen the education of cadres, so that cadres can overcome bourgeois individualism and overcome formalism and the pursuit of honors in their work. Rewarding labor models is an important policy of the Party and the People's Government to lead agricultural production, but labor models must be selected by mobilizing the masses in order to encourage the masses to actively produce. When the cadres of the Second District of Mei Shan County implemented this policy, they adopted the method of monopolization and substitution under the control of bourgeois honors. They did not mobilize the masses to identify and recommend labor models, but instead a few cadres drafted the list and reported it to the higher authorities. These cadres, in order to show their personal performance and ask for credit from the higher authorities, did not hesitate to reverse black and white and create false "models." This bad ideological style has caused great losses to the work of the Party and the government. In the past, we used district and township cadres a lot but educated them little. Although most of them are very active and willing to do their work well, their policy level and ideological level have not been improved for a long time, so they have developed a tendency to be divorced from the masses and divorced from politics. Under these circumstances, the occurrence of the "Red and Black List incident" is not surprising.

	3. We must overcome the bureaucratic work style in leadership, conduct in-depth inspections, and strengthen investigation and research. Although the CPC Mei Shan County Committee held three meetings of district committee secretaries and district chiefs during the process of leading the selection of labor models to make arrangements, explaining the conditions of labor models and the steps and methods of selecting models, and emphasizing the principles of verifying production, democratic evaluation, and public recognition by the masses, it did not emphasize the political conditions of labor models enough, so it did not attract everyone's attention. After this work was arranged, the County Party Committee neither conducted in-depth inspections nor specifically helped the district and township cadres to carry out their work. When reviewing labor models, the county-level Party and government leading organs, because they trusted the reports of the lower levels and only looked at the surface production figures, neglected to review the political conditions of the labor models, resulting in the counter-revolutionary elements and murderers deceiving the title of labor model. The Mei Shan County People's Court failed to seriously implement the sentence, detain Jin, and when it later discovered that Jin had not been detained and decided to arrest him, it only made arrangements without checking, causing the criminal Jin Yu-cheng to be at large for a long time. Why did the work of the Mei Shan County People's Court be like this? In addition to the fact that the CPC Mei Shan County Committee failed to seriously supervise and inspect its work, one of the important reasons is that the acting Vice President of the court, Cheng Yuan-qi, was arrogant and complacent in his work, pursued fame and position, was not at ease with his work, was not responsible, and did not seriously implement the instructions of the Party Committee and the judgments of the higher courts, causing damage to the cause of the Party and the people. Bureaucracy and complacency are the root causes of the "Red and Black List incident." In the future, we must resolutely overcome bureaucracy, improve revolutionary vigilance, overcome complacency; conscientiously improve the work style of cadres, conduct in-depth inspections of work, inspect the implementation of the Party's policies among the masses, so that the connection between the Party and the masses will be further strengthened, and strive to complete the great cause of socialist transformation.

    “红黑榜事件”及其教训
    中共四川省眉山县委书记　王敏
    今年七月间，四川省眉山县群众揭发了一件
  “红黑榜”事件：在眉山县人民法院判处反革命分子、土匪、杀人犯金玉成徒刑的布告附近，同时张贴着一张金玉成被选为县农业劳动模范的光荣红榜。红黑两榜写着同一个人的名字，而且事实上也是同一个人。
    这是怎么回事呢？这样荒谬的事件是怎样发生的呢？
    金玉成是眉山县第二区太和乡狮子村人，解放以前曾杀死他的弟弟金老三；解放初期又匿藏土匪，并且串通惯匪权绍华等，杀害了本县第七区白马乡的一个农民。一九五二年四月土地改革时，经被害家属控告，眉山县人民法院把主犯权绍华判处死刑，其他从犯分别判处有期徒刑。当时因为金玉成供认了案件真情，加以当时案件承办人余淑应（留用人员）认为金玉成不是主犯，就让金犯在未宣判前讨保回家。但在同年四月二十二日正式宣布判处金犯有期徒刑两年时，法院并未传金犯到庭。同年余淑应调离法院移交案卷时，并没有向接交人书记员姚尚庆交代金犯不在押的情况；由于县人民法院领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义，对这种情况长期未能纠正，金犯便一直逍遥法外。直到一九五三年十一月二十六日枪决权绍华时，县人民法院才发觉金犯并未逮捕在押。当时县人民法院负责人虽曾说过派人去逮捕金犯，可是法院一直未派人逮捕，法院负责人以后也没有继续追查。
    就在“回家生产”逍遥法外的这段时间，金犯利用区乡干部的麻痹思想，在村里假装积极，骗取领导干部的信任。在当地指导工作的原副区长陶忠华，工作不深入、不踏实，表面上看到金犯能说会道，他的小麦产量也比较高，就认为“这人不错”，以致金犯得以混入互助组，最后并窃取了互助组副组长的领导地位。这时，群众曾向陶忠华反映金犯的恶迹，但他还不警惕，反而在资产阶级个人主义和锦标主义思想支配下，违背县委关于评选劳动模范所指示的条件，把金犯当作劳动模范“对象”来“培养”，想要给本地区工作争点“光彩”。一九五三年三月，陶忠华调走，金犯继由现任副区长彭元清来“培养”。同年十月间，评选劳动模范工作开始；彭元清虽然也听到干部反映金犯政治上有问题，但他主观地认为反映情况的干部和金犯有“私人意见”，同时又怕“自己培养的劳动模范垮了台，自己脸上不光彩”，因而采取了不老实态度，妄自确定金犯为小麦丰产模范，汇报上级。同年十二月间，县通知各区汇报劳动模范事迹，彭元清即叫乡文书填表，并注明金犯是“经过群众会和小组会议讨论评比通过……”，汇报上去。今年三月间，县领导机关在审查劳动模范材料时，发现金犯的模范事实不具体，接连退回两次，要第二区区人民政府派人实地调查，并发动群众认真民主评选。可是，他们却一直未派人去实地调查，也没有组织群众开会讨论。第二区区人民政府领导人两次让区人民政府和乡人民政府的文书稍微补充一点材料，又送回县人民政府。县评模审查委员会在评议劳动模范时，只着重审查田亩产量，放松了对劳动模范本人政治成份的审查，加以当时参加评议的第二区区委副书记和原第二区区长等也没有提供金玉成的政治情况，结果金犯玉成就被错误地评为劳动模范，出席县劳动模范大会了。
    今年三月间，反革命分子金玉成被评为劳动模范的“光荣榜”贴到各村后，引起太和乡群众的惊异和不满。群众说：“金玉成谎报田亩、产量！”“这模范是谁选出来的！”第二区太和乡的一个农村陪审员立即向县人民政府揭发了这一情况。县人民政府于是在四月下旬逮捕了金犯。
    “红黑榜事件”的发生，给党和政府的工作和威信造成严重的损害。这对于我们县区领导是一次最尖锐的批评和最深刻的教育。现在“红黑榜事件”已经处理了：中共眉山县委和有关干部已公开向群众作了检讨；对某些干部已分别给予党纪处分；反革命分子金玉成已扣捕判刑，并撤销了他的劳动模范称号，基本上挽回了不良的影响。但是，这次事件的教训却永远记在我们心里。这一事件的教训是：
    一、必须加强县区干部的革命法制观念，提高县区干部对于过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性的认识。经过总任务的学习和四中全会决议文件的学习，县区干部的政治觉悟有所提高，但是由于对过渡时期阶级斗争更加复杂的形势认识不足，并且以为经过土地改革、镇压反革命之后，天下便从此太平了，因而在工作中产生了麻痹思想和太平观念，丧失了革命警惕性。再加上革命法制观念的过份缺乏，这就使得反革命杀人犯金玉成能够长期不受法律的制裁。
    二、必须经常加强对干部的教育，使干部克服资产阶级个人主义思想，克服工作中的形式主义和锦标主义。奖励劳动模范是党和人民政府领导农业生产的一项重要政策，但劳动模范必须发动群众评选，才能发生鼓励群众积极生产的作用。眉山县第二区干部执行这一政策时，竟在资产阶级锦标主义思想支配下，采取了包办代替的方法。他们不是发动群众鉴别和推选劳动模范，而是由少数干部拟定名单汇报上级。这些干部为了表现个人和向上级邀功，甚至不惜颠倒黑白，制造假“模范”。这种恶劣的思想作风，给党和政府的工作造成了很大损失。过去我们对区乡干部使用多，教育少，他们大多数虽然很积极，愿意把工作做好，但政策水平和思想水平长期得不到提高，所以就产生了脱离群众和脱离政治的倾向。在这种情况下，“红黑榜事件”的发生也就不足为奇了。
    三、必须克服领导上的官僚主义作风，深入检查工作，加强调查研究。中共眉山县委在领导评选劳动模范工作过程中，虽曾三次召开区委书记、区长会议进行布置，说明劳动模范的条件和评选模范的步骤和方法，强调要查实生产，民主评议，群众公认等原则，但是由于对劳动模范的政治条件强调不够，所以没有引起大家的重视。这项工作布置以后，县委既没有深入检查，更没有具体帮助区乡干部进行工作。审查劳动模范时，县级党政领导机关因为轻信下级报告，只看表面生产数字，忽视审查劳动模范的政治条件，结果便使反革命分子、杀人犯骗得劳动模范的称号。眉山县人民法院未能认真执行判决，扣押金犯，并在后来发觉金犯没被扣押而决定逮捕时，又只作布置而不检查，致使罪犯金玉成长期逍遥法外。眉山县人民法院工作为什么会这样呢？除了中共眉山县委未能认真监督和检查其工作以外，重要原因之一是法院代理副院长程远岐在工作中骄傲自满，闹名誉，闹地位，对工作不安心，不负责，不认真执行党委的指示和上级法院的判决，使党和人民的事业遭受损害。官僚主义和骄傲自满情绪，是发生“红黑榜事件”的根本原因。今后我们必须坚决克服官僚主义，提高革命警惕性，克服麻痹思想；切实改进干部工作作风，深入检查工作，检查党的政策在群众中的执行情况，使党同群众的联系进一步密切起来，为完成社会主义改造的伟大事业而努力。
