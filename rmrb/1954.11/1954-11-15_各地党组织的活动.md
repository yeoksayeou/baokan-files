Activities of Party Organizations in Various Regions

    Admitting Outstanding Individuals from Struggles into the Party
    In Anqing Prefecture, Anhui Province, and other areas, 2,679 outstanding individuals were admitted into the Party during flood prevention, increased production, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After joining the Party, their socialist consciousness was further heightened, and they demonstrated high levels of enthusiasm and selflessness in the intense work of flood prevention, increased production, and mutual aid and cooperation. For example, Ma Xiuying, the female deputy head of Yangtaizi Township in Funan County, who joined the Party in August, worked selflessly during flood prevention and was commended by the Funan County Committee and the Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Gui Liangjin, a new Party member of Baiyang Township, Taopo District, Guichi County, always stood at the forefront of every movement. In July of this year, his house was flooded, and his furniture was washed away. When some people wanted to help him salvage his belongings, he thought of the Kuzhufan Sales and Supply Station of the Baiyang Cooperative, more than three miles away, which was also flooded. He immediately led everyone to the supply station to salvage goods, rescuing more than 5,000 catties of rapeseed and green hemp.
      
    Training Cadres for Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Huimin and Jiaozhou Prefectures in Shandong Province are actively training key personnel for establishing cooperatives. Huimin Prefecture began training key personnel for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest. As of mid-October, more than 6,400 key personnel had been trained, including more than 300 veteran cooperative cadres, 6,062 personnel preparing to establish new cooperatives, and some district and township cadres. The Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is currently concentrating on training more than 300 county and district cadres. When these places train key personnel for establishing cooperatives, they not only organize everyone to study documents such as the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives," but also summarize the experience of veteran cooperatives, enabling trainees to clarify the guidelines, policies, and specific methods of establishing cooperatives from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
    
    Timely Commendation of Outstanding Cadres
    On October 18th, the Deng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province issued a circular on the ideological style of cadres in the current cooperative construction work. The circular commended the good work style of Hu Yunting, a cadre from Wangji District. In leading the development of agricultural production cooperatives, Hu Yunting was able to adhere to the Party's policies, pay attention to cultivating key personnel, and patiently persuade and educate farmers with more ideological concerns. Therefore, the cooperative construction work could develop healthily. Zheng Deheng, the organization committee member of the Peiying District Committee, Li Yuting, the secretary, and Liu Chengxiu, the deputy secretary of the Linba District Committee, were also able to go deep among the masses, overcome difficulties, and do a good job in cooperative work. The Deng County Committee pointed out that these comrades should become role models for everyone to learn from. At the same time, it criticized Du Zeyong, a cadre from Peiying District, for not working properly in Kezheng Township, either sleeping or loafing around, which led to many problems in his work. However, he falsely reported to his superiors, saying, "The achievements are commendable, and there are no problems." The Deng County Committee called on all cadres in the county to guard against arrogance and rashness in the favorable situation of the cooperative movement, diligently study, and better complete the task of building cooperatives after the autumn harvest this year.
      
    Strengthening Leadership in Apple Procurement
    Gaiping County in Liaoning Province is the place in Northeast China that produces the most and best apples. This year, when apple procurement began, the county food company's procurement plan was set too low to purchase large quantities of apple farmers' apples. Therefore, apple farmers raised opinions, demanding to expand and accelerate the procurement. After hearing these opinions, the Gaiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized cadres to conduct investigations in the apple-producing areas. They found that the county food company's original procurement plan was indeed set too low. If procurement were carried out according to the original plan, half of the apples in the county would freeze and rot. The County Committee held an enlarged meeting to discuss this matter specifically, suggested that the food company revise the procurement plan, and instructed the head of the County Committee's Financial and Economic Work Department to supervise the progress of this work. At the same time, the County Committee strengthened the political and ideological work of the procurement personnel. When some new staff members underestimated this work, the Party organization and the trade union organized a forum for new and old staff members to allow the veteran staff to introduce how they went from underestimating this work to loving it. The Party organization repeatedly explained to them the political and economic significance of apple procurement. After the procurement personnel's enthusiasm for work improved, the Party organization and the trade union led everyone to carry out labor competitions. The quantity of apples purchased by the food company every day increased significantly compared to before.
      
    Checking the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
    On October 20th, the Industrial Department of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province convened a joint meeting of the secretaries of the Party committees (branches) of various factories to study and check the progress of the increase production and practice economy movement in various factories. At present, only a few units in Kaifeng City have a relatively good increase production and practice economy movement. Most factories have not well understood the spirit and significance of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement this year. Therefore, they have failed to specifically implement the spirit of increase production and practice economy into various tasks. The leadership of the increase production and practice economy movement is not very specific. In addition, due to the impact of the power outage at the Pulin Power Plant, the completion of the plan in early October was very poor. The meeting studied the above situation and believed that all factories must further earnestly study the documents on increase production and practice economy, strengthen technical management, improve planning management, resolutely implement the responsibility system, and strengthen political work in order to promote the development of the increase production and practice economy movement.
    
    Correcting Deviations in Autumn Harvest Distribution Work
    The Heshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province sent inspection teams and accounting instructors to the countryside to inspect and help agricultural production cooperatives correct shortcomings and errors in the autumn harvest distribution. After the Heshun County Committee focused on inspecting and comprehensively reviewing the distribution plans of agricultural production cooperatives, it found that the distribution plans of some cooperatives did not implement the spirit of the distribution policy. The common problems were: inaccurate estimation of crop yields, with various crops being lower than the actual yield; high investment valuation, improper deduction of public accumulation and investment, and failure to re-evaluate or reduce investment based on the severity of the disaster. According to statistics from sixty cooperatives, only seventeen cooperatives had a dividend per labor day higher than the mutual aid team wage (6,000 yuan), and forty-three cooperatives had a dividend lower than the mutual aid team wage. Among them, eight cooperatives had a labor dividend that was less than half of the mutual aid team wage. Therefore, the vast majority of cooperative members were dissatisfied. After analyzing and studying the above situation, the Heshun County Committee proposed corrective measures. In addition to instructing all cooperatives to earnestly implement the distribution policy and correct all deviations and errors, it also sent inspection teams and accounting instructors to the countryside to go deep into various cooperatives to specifically help revise or re-determine the distribution plans, ensuring that the distribution plans of all agricultural production cooperatives were practical and feasible, so that all cooperative members would be satisfied.

    各地党组织的活动
    吸收斗争中的优秀分子入党
    安徽省安庆专区等地，在防汛、增产和互助合作运动中，吸收了二千六百七十九名优秀分子入党。他们入党后，社会主义觉悟更加提高，在紧张的防汛、增产和互助合作工作中，都表现了高度的积极性和大公无私的精神。如八月份入党的阜南县杨台孜乡女副乡长马秀英，在防汛中忘我地工作，曾经受到中共阜阳地委、阜南县委的表扬。贵池县桃坡区白洋乡新党员桂良进，在每次运动中，都是站在战斗的最前列。今年七月，他的房子进了水，家具被水冲走，有些人要帮助他抢救东西，可是他想到三里以外的白洋合作社苦竹畈分销供应站也受到水淹，便马上带着大家到供应站去抢救，共抢救出菜籽和青麻五千多斤。
      训练农业生产合作社的干部
    山东省惠民、胶州等专区正积极训练办社骨干。惠民专区入秋以后就着手训练办社骨干，截至十月中旬止，已经训练了六千四百余名骨干。其中有老社干部三百余人，准备办新社的骨干六千零六十二人，还有部分区乡干部。中共胶州地委现在正集中三百余名县区干部进行训练。这些地方训练办社骨干时，除了组织大家学习了“中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议”、“中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”等文件，还总结了老社办社经验，使参加学习的学员从理论到实际，明确办社的方针、政策和具体作法。
    及时表扬优秀干部
    中共河南邓县县委会于十月十八日就目前建社工作中干部的思想作风问题发出通报。通报表扬了王集区干部胡云廷的好作风。胡云廷在领导发展农业生产合作社的工作中，能够坚持党的政策，注意培养骨干分子，并对思想顾虑较多的农民，进行耐心的说服教育工作。因此，建社工作能健康地向前发展。裴营区委组织委员郑德恒，秘书李玉亭，林扒区区委副书记刘成秀等也都能深入群众，克服困难，做好合作社工作。邓县县委指出：这些同志应该成为大家的学习榜样。同时批评了裴营区区干部杜泽永在科郑乡不好好工作，不是睡觉，便是闲逛，以致工作中的问题很多，但是他却向上级假报告：“成绩可嘉，没有问题”。邓县县委号召全县干部，在合作社运动的顺利形势下，必须戒骄戒躁，刻苦钻研，更好地完成今年秋后建社任务。
      加强对苹果收购工作的领导
    辽宁省盖平县是东北出产苹果最多最好的地方。今年，开始收购苹果时，由于县食品公司收购计划订得过低，不能大量收购果农的苹果，因此果农纷纷提出意见，要求扩大和加速收购。中共盖平县委会听到这些意见后，便组织干部到产果区进行调查，发现县食品公司的原收购计划确实订的太低，如果按原计划收购，全县就会有一半苹果受冻腐烂。县委扩大会议对此作了专门的讨论，建议食品公司重新修改收购计划；并责成县委财经工作部长监督这一工作的进行。县委同时加强了对收购人员的政治思想工作。当有些新的工作人员轻视这个工作时，党组织便和工会组织新老工作人员座谈会，让老工作人员介绍自己如何从轻视这一工作到热爱这一工作。党组织又向他们反复说明收购苹果的政治意义和经济意义。收购人员的工作热情提高以后，党组织和工会又领导大家开展了劳动竞赛。食品公司每天收购苹果的数量比原来大大增加。
      检查增产节约运动
    中共河南开封市委工业部于十月二十日召开了各厂党委（支部）书记联席会议，研究检查了各厂增产节约运动开展情况。目前开封市各厂仅有少数单位增产节约运动的情况较好，多数厂还没有很好地领会今年开展增产节约运动的精神和意义，因此没能把增产节约精神具体地贯彻到各项工作中去，对增产节约运动的领导很不具体，再加以普临电厂停电的影响，因而十月上旬计划完成情况很不好。会议研究了上述情况，认为各厂必须进一步认真地学习增产节约文件，加强技术管理，提高计划管理，坚决贯彻责任制度，加强政治工作，以推动增产节约运动的开展。
    纠正秋收分配工作中的偏差
    中共山西和顺县委曾派检查组和会计辅导员下乡，检查并帮助农业生产合作社纠正秋收分配中的缺点和错误。和顺县委重点检查和普遍审查了农业生产合作社的分配方案后，发现有些社的分配方案没有贯彻分配政策的精神，普遍存在的问题是：对作物产量预估得不确切，各种作物都低于实产量；投资作价高、扣除公共积累和投资不恰当，受灾后也没有根据灾情重评或减退投资；农副业收入分红也不统一不适当。据六十个社的统计，每个劳动日分红高出互助组工资（六千元）的只有十七个，不及互助组工资的有四十三个社，其中有八个社的劳动分红尚不及互助组的工资的一半。因此，极大部分社员都不满意。和顺县委分析研究了上述情况，提出纠正办法后，除指示所有社认真贯彻分配政策，纠正一切偏向和错误外，并派检查组和会计辅导员下乡，深入各社，具体帮助修正或重订分配方案，保证所有农业生产合作社的分配方案订的切实可行，做到全体社员都满意。
