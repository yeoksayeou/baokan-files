    Harvest on the Plateau
    By Our Reporter Liu Shiping

    In September, the rural areas of Yunnan present a scene of abundant harvest everywhere.

    The Sani and Axi farmers living in Guishan and Xishan also celebrate this year's harvest like the farmers in the坝子 (plains).

    In the second half of September, I visited Yizheng Township in the first district of Guishan, Lunan County, Yunnan, and Youzhadi Village in the fifth district of Xishan Yi Autonomous Region, Mile County. Yizheng Township is a township where the Sani people live, and Youzhadi Village is a village where the Axi people live. Anyone who has read the Sani epic "Ashima" and the Axi moon dance, or who has been to that place, knows that the Sani and Axi people are diligent, simple, brave, and enthusiastic people.

    Although the languages of the Sani and Axi people are different, and their costumes are also different; however, they both live on the high and steep plateaus, and they have taken and are taking a common path for the transformation of mountainous agricultural production.

    Both of these places have undergone land reform; in the past two years, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid groups has reached more than 90% of the local farmers. In order to change the soil quality of the red soil in the mountainous area, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers have fixed their cultivated land and gradually learned to process and apply fertilizer. Last year, the crops in Yizheng Township increased by an average of 80% compared with the previous year, becoming a high-yield township in the entire Guishan area. This year, due to the mountain flood disaster, production decreased compared with last year, but it still increased compared with the year before. Youzhadi Village had a better harvest this year than in previous years. The main crop, corn, increased by 15%, and dry rice is expected to increase by 20% to 30%.

    The reason why they were able to transform the mountainous land, which was said to be "ten plantings, nine failures" in the past, is mainly due to the improvement of farming methods, in addition to the ditching and flood discharge carried out over the years.

    The Lunan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has drawn the following conclusion based on the experience of transforming mountainous agricultural production over the past few years: "To achieve the goal of transformation, we must first start with fixing the cultivated land area in order to process and apply fertilizer." Taking Yizheng Township as an example, the township has more than 8,000 mu of cultivated land, the vast majority of which is dry land (only three mu of paddy fields). There are 188 households in the township (of which 143 are Sani). Generally, each household cultivates 40 to 50 mu of land, plus about 100 mu of fallow land. In the past, under long-term feudal exploitation, although they cultivated a lot of land, the farming was extensive. Generally, the land was plowed shallowly, the seeds were sown, and some were hoeed once and some manure was applied, while others were not hoeed at all and no manure was applied, and they just waited for the harvest. In this way, the land became thinner and thinner, which led to the habit of shifting cultivation.

    After the land reform in 1952, Li Guifang, a farmer in Yizheng Township, learned advanced farming methods such as seed selection, seed soaking, and seed mixing. He harvested 430 jin of corn per mu, while another farmer in the same township, because he cultivated a lot of land and could not cultivate intensively, only harvested 99 jin per mu. These vivid examples made them begin to change their past thinking that "if you plant more, it is not enough to eat, and if you plant less, it is even less enough to eat," emphasizing quantity over quality.

    At present, the farmers in Yizheng Township have begun to realize that fixing the cultivated land can concentrate manpower and animal power; only by processing and applying fertilizer on the fixed land can the yield per unit area be increased.

    In the past, whether in the villages of Xishan or Guishan, human manure, cattle and horse manure, and pig manure were thrown in the street or piled in the patio, which affected environmental hygiene and made diseases easy to spread.

    This year, due to the widespread accumulation of fertilizer, not only was there a bumper harvest of grain, but people were also much healthier. According to the comrades in the Xishan Health Center: "This year's fertilizer accumulation is something that has not happened in the past few decades; in this way, the manure has a use. The epidemic in the whole district has also decreased compared with previous years."

    Zhang Shaoxian is a member of the Wang Guoqiang mutual aid group in Youzhadi Village. When talking about the story of accumulating fertilizer, she finds it a little funny herself. Once, she went to the market in Mile County to buy a pottery jar for storing things, but she couldn't find one after running through the whole street. Later, she walked into a family's yard and saw a manure bucket. She quickly ran out, wanting to vomit. After walking fifty or sixty li, when she returned home, she still felt uncomfortable in her heart, and she couldn't even eat that night.

    This year, Zhang Shaoxian saw that the seedlings grown from crops that had not been applied with basal fertilizer and top dressing were yellow, thin, and short; the crops that had been applied with basal fertilizer and top dressing grew green, and she also changed her past view of human manure. This year, she has personally driven a horse to carry manure buckets. Sometimes the manure bucket is not tightly covered, and manure water sprays out of the bucket. She walks along the way, grabbing mud and smearing the manure bucket, and she doesn't feel dirty anymore.

    The first person to build a toilet in Youzhadi Village was Zhang Yuqing of the Wang Guoqiang group. She started building a toilet in 1950. At that time, the whole village only had one toilet in the district government. The farmers were not used to building toilets. The women thought that going to the toilet was smelly and afraid of running into their own family members, which was embarrassing. Zhang Yuqing also had resistance in her mind before building the toilet. In the past, like Zhang Shaoxian, she wanted to vomit when she smelled feces when she entered the city or went to the plain area. After the comrades of the district committee repeatedly educated her, her thinking changed. Later, she used manure water to irrigate hot peppers and cornfields, and as a result, the crops grew very well.

    Now, all 94 households in Youzhadi Village have built toilets.

    The head of another mutual aid group, Lu Yufeng, had visited farms in Kunming and also visited the agricultural production cooperative led by Zhang Huiying, which is famous throughout the province, in Yiliang.

    After Lu Yufeng returned from the visit, he began to advocate composting and using chemical fertilizers in the whole village last year. Their group not only understood the benefits of fertilization, but also learned salt water seed selection and warm water seed soaking. This year, they applied 18 loads of barnyard manure and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer per jia of land (one jia is about equal to three 市亩), and as a result, the yield increased by 30%.

    Due to the improvement of farming techniques and increased yields, the Sani and Axi farmers living in Guishan and Xishan have a very high enthusiasm for production.

    When I left Youzhadi Village, Qi Zhenghua, who was stationed at the agricultural technology promotion station in this village, excitedly said to me: "Just in the 532 jia of land in Youzhadi Village, only 465 jia of land were planted with spring crops in previous years, and the remaining 67 jia of slope land were left barren. This year, in order to respond to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, these 67 jia of land have also been sown with rapeseed."

    According to a survey in 1952, cash crops here accounted for 67% of all crops. This year, in the fifth district of Xishan, every household has planted walnuts. According to Liu Guihua, the head of the Xishan Trade Group: "It is estimated that each household has planted more than 100 walnut trees. The rapeseed procurement task has also been overfulfilled." Preliminary statistics show that this year, 137,216 walnut trees and 2,130 palm trees have been planted in the entire fifth district. Pine nut trees and various fruit trees such as peaches, plums, and pears have also been planted.

### 高原上的丰收

    高原上的丰收
    本报记者　刘时平
    九月间，云南的农村里，到处呈现着丰收的景象。
    住在圭山、西山的撒尼、阿西农民，也和坝子（平川）里的农民一样，欢庆着今年的丰收。
    九月下半月，我曾先后访问了云南路南县圭山第一区的宜政乡，弥勒县彝族自治区西山第五区的油榨地村。宜政乡是撒尼人聚居的乡，油榨地村是阿西人聚居的村。凡是看过撒尼长篇叙事诗“阿诗玛”同阿西跳月，或者到过那个地方的人，都知道撒尼和阿西人都是勤劳、朴素、勇敢、热情的民族。
    撒尼和阿西人的语言虽然不同，服装也有区别；可是，他们都是住在山高坡陡的高原上，他们对于山区农业生产的改造，已经走了并正走着共同的道路。
    这两个地方都已经进行了土地改革；两年来，参加互助组的农户，已达当地农户的百分之九十以上。农民们为了改变山区红色土壤的土质，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，固定了耕地，逐步学会了加工施肥。去年，宜政乡的农作物比前年平均增产了八成，成为全圭山区的丰产乡，今年，因为遭受山洪灾害，比去年减产，但比前年还是增产。油榨地村今年比往年的收成都好，主要农作物苞谷增产一成半，旱稻预计增产二成到三成。
    他们所以能够把过去所谓“十种九不收”的山地改造过来，除了历年来进行了开沟排洪外，主要的是改进了耕作方法。
    中共路南县委会根据几年来改造山区农业生产的经验，得出这样一个结论：“要达到改造的目的，首先必须从固定耕地面积着手，才能做到加工施肥。”以宜政乡为例，全乡有耕地八千多亩，绝大多数是旱地（只有三亩水田），全乡一百八十八户（其中撒尼有一百四十三户），一般的每户种地四十到五十亩，加上轮歇地有一百亩左右。过去长期在封建剥削下，虽然种的地多，但耕作粗放，一般耕种是地犁得浅，犁了地，撒了种，有的锄一道，压点粪，有的连一道也不锄，粪也不压，就等着收割。这样，地越种越薄，就造成了轮歇耕作的习惯。
    宜政乡的农民李桂方，在一九五二年土地改革后，学会了选种、浸种、拌种等先进的耕作方法，一亩苞谷收了四百三十斤，而同乡的另一个农民，因为地种的多，不能精耕细作，每亩只收了九十九斤。这些活生生的事例，使他们开始改变了过去认为“种得多都不够吃，种少了更不够吃”的重量不重质的思想。
    目前，宜政乡的农民，开始认识了固定耕地能够集中人力、畜力；在固定下来的土地上面加工施肥，才能够提高单位面积产量。
    过去，不论是在西山或圭山的乡村里，人粪、牛马粪、猪粪丢在街心或者堆在天井里，影响环境卫生，疾病容易流行。
    今年，由于普遍积肥，不但粮食丰收，人也健康多了。据西山卫生所的同志说：“今年积肥，是过去几十年来没有过的事；这样作，粪便有了用处。全区的流行病也比往年减少了。”
    张绍仙是油榨地村王国强互助组的组员。说起积肥的故事来，她自己还有点好笑。有一次，她到弥勒县城赶街子，想买一个放东西的瓦罐罐，跑了满条街，都没有买到。后来走到一家人的院子里，看到一个粪桶，她赶快跑出来，只想呕吐，走了五、六十里路，回到家后，她的心里还不好过，那天晚上，她连饭都吃不下去。
    今年张绍仙看到没有压底肥、施追肥的庄稼，长出来的苗苗，又黄、又瘦、又矮；压了底肥，又施了追肥的庄稼，就长的绿油油的，也改变了她过去对人粪的看法。今年她已亲自赶着马驮粪桶，有时候粪桶盖不严，粪水从桶中喷出来，她一路走，一路抓泥巴，把粪桶糊起来，也不觉得脏了。
    在油榨地村最早盖厕所的，是王国强组的张玉清。她开始盖厕所是在一九五○年。当时全村只有区政府有一个厕所，农民对盖厕所都不习惯，妇女们认为到厕所又臭，又怕碰见自家人，不好意思。张玉清在盖厕所前，思想上也有抵触。过去她和张绍仙一样，一进城或到平坝区，闻到大粪，就想吐。经过区委会的同志几次三番的教育，她的思想才改变过来。后来她用大粪水浇辣子和苞谷地，结果庄稼长的很好。
    现在，油榨地村九十四户人家，每家都盖了厕所。
    另一个互助组的组长卢玉丰，他曾到昆明参观过农场，也到宜良参观过闻名全省的张惠英领导的农业生产合作社。
    卢玉丰参观回来后，去年开始在全村提倡堆肥，并用化学肥料。他们组不但懂得了施肥的好处，而且学会了盐水选种和温汤浸种。他们今年一架地（一架约合三市亩）压厩肥十八驮，化学肥料三十斤，结果增产了三成。
    由于改进了耕作技术，提高了产量，住在圭山、西山的撒尼、阿西农民生产情绪都很高。
    当我离开油榨地村时，驻在这个村的农业技术推广站的戚正华兴奋地对我说：“光是油榨地村的五百三十二架地，往年种小春的只有四百六十五架地，其余六十七架坡地放荒。今年农民们为了响应共产党和人民政府的号召，这六十七架地，也播种了菜籽。”
    据一九五二年的调查，这里的经济作物，占全部农作物的百分之六十七。今年在西山的第五区，家家户户都栽了核桃。据西山贸易组的组长刘卉华说：“估计每家栽核桃一百棵以上。菜籽的收购任务也超额完成了。”初步统计今年五区全区已栽种核桃树十三万七千二百十六棵，棕树二千一百三十棵。还栽了松子树和桃、李、梨等各种果树。
