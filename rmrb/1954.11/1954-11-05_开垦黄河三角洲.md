    Reclaiming the Yellow River Delta
    The low-lying areas in the Yellow River Delta, which hold water year-round, can be reclaimed into 700,000 mu of fertile farmland. Under the support of the local people's government, 48 agricultural production cooperatives in Kenli and Guangrao counties have sent a large number of people to this area to reclaim wasteland, preparing to expand the cultivated area next year.
    The Yellow River Delta, also known as Da Xiao Gu Dao (Big and Small Lonely Islands), is located at the estuary of the Yellow River, bordering the Bohai Bay to the east, and belongs to Kenli County, Shandong Province. The lower reaches of the Yellow River, after passing through Shandong Province, divide into two rivers east of Shiba Hu (a village in the southern part of Kenli County) and enter the sea. The northern river is called Shenxian Gou, also known as the North Yellow River; the southern river is called Tianshui Gou, also known as the South Yellow River. The large delta formed between the two rivers is called Da Gu Dao (Big Lonely Island). The Tianshui Gou River flows eastward to Jianshe Village and then divides into two rivers entering the sea, with the small delta formed in between called Xiao Gu Dao (Small Lonely Island). The total area of the delta is 760,000 mu. For many years, with the siltation caused by the river's sediment, the topography of the delta has gradually changed. During this year's flood season, the Yellow River water has silted up the upper entrance of Tianshui Gou, and the entire river flows smoothly into the sea through the North Yellow River channel. At present, the southern part of Da Gu Dao and the entire Xiao Gu Dao, which used to be low-lying areas holding water year-round, have dried up and become continuous areas of land that can be reclaimed.
    The Yellow River Delta originally had seventeen villages, with 48,000 mu of land already reclaimed in the past. According to the crop planting situation of the reclamation people in the past two years, the alluvial soil of the delta is suitable for planting soybeans, wheat, cotton, etc. Soybeans yield 160 jin per mu, and cotton yields as high as 300 jin of seed cotton per mu.

### 开垦黄河三角洲

    开垦黄河三角洲
    黄河三角洲里常年储水的低洼地区，可以开垦出七十万亩肥沃耕地。在当地人民政府的扶植下，垦利、广饶两县已有四十八个农业生产合作社派出大批人到这个地区开荒，准备明年扩大耕地面积。
    黄河三角洲，又称大小孤岛，地当黄河入海处，东临渤海湾，属山东省垦利县。黄河下流，经过山东境内，到十八户（垦利县南部一个庄）以东分成两股河水入海。北股河水叫神仙沟，又名北黄河；南股叫甜水沟，又名南黄河。两股河水之间形成大三角洲称大孤岛。甜水沟河水东行到建设村又分成两股入海，中间形成小三角洲称小孤岛。三角洲面积共计七十六万市亩。多少年来，随着河水含泥沙的冲淤，三角洲的地形逐渐改变。今年汛期，黄河水已将甜水沟上口淤塞，整个河水由北黄河道畅流入海。目前，大孤岛南部及小孤岛全部，过去常年储水的低洼地都已干涸，变成连片的可以开垦的土地。
    黄河三角洲，原有十七个村庄，过去即垦地四万八千亩。根据垦民两年来种植农作物的情况来看，三角洲冲积土壤，适于种植大豆、小麦、棉花等。大豆每亩产一百六十斤，棉花每亩产籽棉高达三百斤。         （新华社）
