Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: The Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau's seven construction engineering companies and one specialized installation company had reduced costs by over 169.9 billion yuan by the end of September, accounting for 12.3 percent of the completed project value, of which over 46.7 billion yuan has been initially turned over to the state. This amount of capital, if used for construction, could build over 100 three-story employee dormitories, each with an area of 1,500 square meters.

Their main methods for reducing costs are increasing labor productivity and saving raw materials. After the seven construction engineering companies implemented the piece-rate wage system, workers generally exceeded labor quotas. In the first half of the year, the average production value per worker increased by 93 percent compared to the same period last year. Various construction units also promoted many advanced experiences. Promoting the concrete weight ratio mixing method alone saves about 80 kilograms of cement per cubic meter of concrete. The Second Construction Engineering Company of the city adopted over 100 technical measures to greatly reduce costs. In the Hepingli construction area alone, over 5.7 billion yuan was saved by the end of September. The Fifth Construction Engineering Company of the city organized construction technicians to review and modify design drawings before construction started, saving a lot of steel.

Implementing unified allocation and centralized processing of materials is also one of the important methods to reduce costs. As a result, the processing plants of many companies rationally use raw materials and avoid using long materials for short purposes, large materials for small purposes, and high-quality materials for low-quality purposes. The steel processing plant of the Second Construction Engineering Company of the city used simple machines such as rebar bending machines and rebar cutters, which made the processing time of each ton of rebar exceed the labor quota by 40 percent. The rebar loss rate was also reduced from 10 percent to 3 percent. They also used over 1,700 kilograms of short, scrap rebar ends to make odd ironwork.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Over 180 construction sites in Beijing have workers participating in labor emulation drives, and they have successively reached or exceeded labor quotas. Of the 484 groups in the Seventh Construction Engineering Company of Beijing, 452 groups have reached or exceeded labor quotas. Liu Chou's plastering team of the First Construction Engineering Company directly under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau could only reach 50 percent of the labor quota. In the emulation drive, they adjusted the labor organization and implemented a segmented responsibility system, and now they have reached over 93 percent. Huang Awu, the bricklaying foreman of the Fourth Construction Engineering Company of Beijing, used a "standard platform" to tell the workers how much work to do each day to complete the plan, so that everyone knew what to aim for, thus ensuring the progress and quality of the project. When the workers of the First Construction Area of the Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry were hoisting roof panels, they could only hoist 120 pieces on the first day. Later, they improved the use of the winch and the operation of unloading the panels, and averaged 400 pieces per day, with a maximum of 520 pieces.

In order to further expand the labor emulation drive, the Beijing Committee of the Chinese Construction Trade Union held an enlarged cadre meeting of more than 1,200 people on November 2 to exchange experiences in the emulation drive.

### 北京建筑工程局九个月降低成本千余亿元  全市已有一百八十多个建筑工地的职工展开劳动竞赛

    北京建筑工程局九个月降低成本千余亿元
    全市已有一百八十多个建筑工地的职工展开劳动竞赛
    【新华社七日讯】北京市建筑工程局所属七个建筑工程公司和一个专业安装公司，到九月底已降低成本一千六百九十九亿多元，占完成工程造价的百分之十二点三，其中初步上缴给国家的已有四百六十七亿元。这笔资金如用在建设上，就可以建筑每幢面积一千五百平方公尺的三层职工宿舍一百多幢。
    他们降低成本的主要方法，是提高劳动生产率和节约原材料。七个建筑工程公司推行计件工资制以后，工人们普遍超过劳动定额，今年上半年平均每个工人的生产总值就比去年同期提高了百分之九十三。各建筑单位还推行了许多先进经验，其中光是推行混凝土重量比的配合方法，每一立方公尺的混凝土就能节省水泥八十公斤左右。市第二建筑工程公司采取一百多项技术措施，使成本大大降低，仅和平里工区一处，到九月底就节约了五十七亿多元。市第五建筑工程公司在开工前就组织施工技术人员审查和修改设计图纸，节省了很多钢筋。
    实行材料的统一调配和集中加工，也是降低成本的重要方法之一。很多公司的加工厂都因此合理使用原材料，避免了长材短用、大材小用和优材劣用。市第二建筑工程公司的钢筋加工厂使用拉筋机、断筋器等简单机具，使每吨钢筋的加工时间超过劳动定额百分之四十，钢筋损耗率也由百分之十降低为百分之三，还利用了一千七百多公斤的短废钢筋头做零星铁活。
    据新华社讯：北京市已有一百八十多个建筑工地的职工参加劳动竞赛，并纷纷达到或超过劳动定额。北京市第七建筑工程公司四百八十四个小组中，达到或超过劳动定额的已有四百五十二个小组。华北建筑工程局直属第一建筑工程公司的抹灰工刘丑班原来只能达到劳动定额百分之五十，他们在竞赛中调整劳动组织，实行分段负责制，现在已达到百分之九十三以上。北京市第四建筑工程公司的瓦工工长黄阿五，利用“标准台”告诉工人们每天做多少活就算完成计划，使大家心中有数，因而保证了工程的进度和质量。纺织工业部基本建设局工程公司第一工区的工人在吊屋面板时，第一天只能吊一百二十块，后来改进卷扬机的使用和卸板操作，每天平均吊到四百块，最高达到五百二十块。
    中国建筑工会北京市委员会为使劳动竞赛进一步展开，十一月二日召开了一千二百多人的扩大干部会议，交流了竞赛的经验。
