    Jingjiang Embankment Reinforcement Project Completes Construction Preparations
    Dongting Lake Levee Restoration Project to Fully Commence
    The Jingjiang Embankment reinforcement project has completed construction preparations. By the end of November, civilian laborers from Jiangling, Qianjiang, Jingmen, and Shashi counties and cities will all be on the embankment as planned. Currently, work has partially begun in Shashi and Jiangling. It is expected that 80,000 civilian laborers will participate in construction along the entire line in December. Rice, firewood, and other materials and equipment are being transported to the construction site continuously.
    The Dongting Lake levee restoration project is about to fully commence. The water receded earlier in the South Dongting Lake area, and the pile driving and surveying work is nearing completion. Civilian laborers are arriving at the construction site one after another. Work has partially started in all the polders throughout the area. Among them, the Dazhong polder, a key reclamation area, officially commenced work on the 12th. By the 19th, more than 27,000 civilian laborers had taken to the embankment in the entire area. The West Dongting Lake area and the Datong Lake area are lower in elevation, and there is still water accumulation at the construction sites. The Changde District Headquarters, the Datong Lake Sub-Headquarters, and the counties of Changde Prefecture have successively held cadre meetings to actively prepare for the commencement of work. Currently, Datong Lake has blocked the breach in the Changgu polder, preventing the Ouchi River water from entering and accelerating drainage; along the long levee line, engineering personnel are rushing to survey; and the advance team of civilian laborers are building sheds and clearing earth fields. The West Dongting Lake area is excavating drainage outlets to expedite the draining of accumulated water, while also conducting surveying, clearing the foundations, and other preparatory work. The counties of Changde Prefecture bordering the lake have begun mobilizing civilian laborers, surveying bridges and crossings, and setting up tea stations. It is expected that civilian laborers from all locations will arrive at the construction sites in early next month. (Our Wuhan Reporter Station)

    荆江大堤加固工程完成施工准备工作
    洞庭湖堤垸修复工程即将全面开工
    荆江大堤的加固工程已完成施工准备工作，十一月底江陵、潜江、荆门、沙市等县市民工将按照计划全部上堤。目前沙市、江陵已部分开工。十二月间预计全线将有八万民工参加施工。大米、烧柴和其他物资器材已源源运到工地。
    洞庭湖堤垸修复工程即将全面开工。南洞庭湖区退水较早，打桩放样工作将近完成，民工正陆续到达工地。全区各垸都已部分开工。其中，重点垦区大众垸已于十二日正式开工。到十九日，全区有二万七千多民工上堤。西洞庭湖区和大通湖区地势较低，工地还有积水。常德区指挥部、大通湖分指挥部和常德专区各县先后召开干部会议，积极准备开工。现在，大通湖已堵好长固垸溃口，使藕池河水不能侵入，加速了排水；漫长的堤线上，工程人员正赶紧放样；前站民工在搭盖工棚、清理土场。西洞庭湖区正挖掘放水口，赶排渍水，同时进行放样、清基等准备工作。常德专区滨湖各县已经开始动员民工，并勘察桥梁渡口，设置茶水站。预计各地民工在下月初将全部到达工地。  （本报武汉记者站）
