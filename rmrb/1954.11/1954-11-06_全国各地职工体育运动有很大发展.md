Workers' sports activities have greatly developed throughout the country.

This year, calisthenics has been more widely carried out in factories and mines in various regions. Among the 658 factories and mines in 18 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Lüda, Anshan, Guangzhou, and Guiyang, 471 factories and mines have launched calisthenics, with over 200,000 workers regularly participating. In Zigong City, Sichuan Province, 13 factories and mines with more than 100 people have all started calisthenics. This year, the number of workers participating in sports activities in the national railway system has reached over 520,000, more than five times the number in 1950. Currently, in 303 factories and mines in nine cities including Beijing, Anshan, Benxi, and Guangzhou, there are 2,661 basketball teams, 1,420 volleyball teams, and 224 football teams, with a total of more than 76,000 workers participating in various ball sports. At the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company in Lüda City, there are 47 basketball teams, 40 football teams, 41 volleyball teams, and more than 40 track and field athletes who regularly practice and compete.

This year, cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jinan, Nanjing, Nanchang, and Xi'an have all held workers' sports meets.

After launching mass sports activities in factories and mines in various regions, the number of workers suffering from illness has been greatly reduced. In the first quarter of this year, workers absent from work due to illness at the Benxi Iron and Steel Company accounted for 12 percent of the total absenteeism. By the second quarter, workers absent from work due to illness accounted for less than 1 percent of the total absenteeism. The average attendance rate of workers in the second quarter reached over 97 percent, thus ensuring that the main workshops completed the first half of the year's production tasks 17 days ahead of schedule.

In mass sports activities, many excellent worker athletes have emerged, and workers' sports skills have also improved. At the Second Beijing Workers' Sports Meet held this year, 23 records were broken compared to the previous Beijing Workers' Sports Meet. The football team representing the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company in Lüda City came to Beijing this year to compete and drew with China's famous "August 1st" football team and the Central Institute of Physical Education football team.

    全国各地职工体育运动有很大发展
    全国各地职工体育运动有很大发展。
    今年，广播体操在各地厂矿中已更广泛地开展起来。北京、上海、旅大、鞍山、广州、贵阳等十八个城市的六百五十八个厂矿中，已有四百七十一个厂矿开展了广播体操，经常参加体操的职工达二十万人以上。四川省自贡市有十三个一百人以上的厂矿都开展了广播体操。今年全国铁路系统职工参加体育运动的人数已达五十二万以上，比一九五零年增加五倍多。目前，北京、鞍山、本溪、广州等九个城市三百零三个厂矿中，共有篮球队二千六百六十一队、排球队一千四百二十队、足球队二百二十四队，共有职工七万六千多人参加各项球类运动。在旅大市中苏造船公司，经常练习和比赛的篮球队有四十七个，足球队有四十个，排球队有四十一个，田径运动员有四十多人。
    今年，北京、天津、上海、济南、南京、南昌和西安等城市都开过职工体育运动会。
    各地厂矿开展群众性体育运动以后，职工患病的人数大大减少。本溪钢铁公司今年第一季度全厂因病缺勤的职工占缺勤总人数的百分之十二，到第二季度因病缺勤的还不到缺勤总人数的百分之一，第二季度职工的平均出勤率达到百分之九十七以上，因而，保证了主要车间都能提前十七天完成了上半年的生产任务。
    在群众性体育运动中，出现了不少优秀的工人运动员，职工的运动技术也有了提高。今年北京市举行的第二届工人体育运动大会，就有二十三项成绩打破了北京市上一届工人体育运动大会的纪录。旅大市中苏造船公司的足球代表队，今年到北京来比赛，和我国著名的“八一”足球队和中央体育学院足球队打成平局。  （新华社）
