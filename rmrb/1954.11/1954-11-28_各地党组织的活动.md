	Activities of Party Organizations in Various Localities
	
	Communicating the Resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session to Grassroots Party Organizations
	The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee led the city's Party organizations in thoroughly implementing the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session. The CPC Committees of Beiguan, Nanshi, Dadong and other districts of Shenyang successively convened representative conferences from November 9th to 18th to convey and implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and to review the work of the District Committees. The First Representative Conference of the CPC Nanshi District Committee, under the direct leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee, not only summarized and reviewed the work of the District Committee, but also exchanged experiences in the work of grassroots Party organizations. The conference was filled with an atmosphere of democratic unity and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism from beginning to end.
	The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee also decided that from the fourth quarter of this year to the end of the second quarter of next year, it will use Party days and workers' political education time to conduct in-depth and systematic education on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session for all Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools throughout the city. The Shenyang Municipal Committee has compiled unified teaching materials. Party organizations at all levels have basically hired teachers and arranged teaching schedules. The vast majority of units are actively studying teaching and tutoring work and are specifically formulating teaching plans. Party organizations in units such as the 53 Factory, Northeast Institute of Technology, and Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have already begun their studies.
	
	Timely Criticism of Complacency
	In September, Yunnan Textile Factory focused on implementing the weekly work plan, and progress in completing tasks improved compared to the past. Many workshops developed complacency as a result. After discovering this problem, the CPC Yunnan Textile Factory Committee convened a meeting of all Party member representatives on October 28th to mobilize the entire Party to criticize complacency. Party member representatives all examined problems in their work. For example, one workshop branch secretary originally thought that his workshop's plan was well-written, so when compiling the October plan, he did not accept the administrative leadership's instructions to reduce the speed of the machines, resulting in an unbalanced completion of the 23-count yarn plan in the first and middle ten days of October. Some workshop branches examined the past erroneous thinking of emphasizing their special circumstances and being unwilling to implement the weekly work plan. Some representatives criticized their own complacency after implementing the weekly work plan and completing the plan relatively well, and expressed their intention to use practical actions to lead the masses in striving to complete and overfulfill the state plan. The meeting resolved that in the future, they should continue to deeply study the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and criticize the bourgeois individualistic complacency in order to ensure the completion of the fourth quarter state plan.
	
	Importance Placed on the Education of Labor Models
	On November 13th, the CPC Tianjin Railway Transportation Branch Committee convened a conference of labor models and advanced workers. The meeting revealed that some labor models and advanced workers were developing negative tendencies such as arrogance, bragging, and even failing to conscientiously execute orders or humbly learn from advanced experiences. For example, the driver of a model youth charter group was found sleeping while on duty, resulting in a serious accident of overrunning a signal. The Second Model Shunting Team of the Tianjin Station Operations C shift violated operating procedures, causing a major accident of vehicle collision. Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders who attended the meeting all reviewed their shortcomings in the cultivation and education of labor models, believing that this was the main reason for the complacency of labor models. Some units did not sufficiently recognize the great significance of consolidating and improving the political and ideological level of labor models, and their leadership of this work was generalized, with only arrangements and a lack of inspection. Some units did not have a clear division of labor and system for the cultivation of labor models and did not understand their ideological situation and difficulties in their work. Many labor models and advanced workers examined and criticized their own arrogance at the meeting, and expressed that they would definitely correct their mistakes in the future, closely connect with the masses, and play a leading and backbone role in order to ensure the completion of the production increase and frugality plan. At this meeting, methods for cultivating labor models and advanced workers were formulated, and it was stipulated that the Party Committee should include this work in its agenda and designate one Party Committee member to be responsible for it. The meeting also requested that all units guarantee the time for labor models to study politics and technology.
	
	Strengthening Education for New Party Members
	The CPC Jiang’an District Committee in Wuhan City recently held amateur Party lectures to educate new Party members and activists who were developed in the fight against floods on basic Party knowledge. And taking factories as units, carried out Party lectures with the general line as the content for general Party members who already have basic Party knowledge. Party lectures are closely integrated with the central work, thus improving the socialist consciousness of Party members and promoting production. For example, workers Wu Yuanshu (Party member) of the small packaging department and Chen Daohong (Party member) of the board removal department of Wuhan Match Factory were always unable to complete the production plan in the past. This time, after they studied basic Party knowledge and improved their awareness, they can now complete the plan.
	The Jiang'an District Committee attaches great importance to Party lectures, including them in the District Committee's work plan and stipulating Party lecture days. The District Committee Secretary and members all serve as Party lecture teachers. Many factory Party organizations also include Party lectures as an important work of the Party Committee or branch, and assign special personnel to be responsible for management. The District Committee also leads Party lecture teachers in collective lesson preparation, helping to solve specific difficulties in teaching to improve the quality of lectures.
	
	Strengthening Political Work in the Formulation of Plans
	Under the leadership of the Fushun Municipal Committee, the CPC Fushun Mining Bureau Committee convened a meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of the 13 factories and mines under the Mining Bureau, introducing to everyone the experience of Soviet enterprise Party organizations in political work in the formulation of plans, requiring the strengthening of political work in the formulation of next year's production and financial plans, and changing the phenomenon of conservative plans in the past years. The Mining Bureau Party Committee required each factory and mine Party Committee to send a stronger full-time cadre to participate in the planning committee of each factory and mine, to understand the situation of the planning work from beginning to end, and to help Party and League members participating in the planning work form temporary Party and Communist Youth League branches, and to carry out ideological education work among the planning personnel. Every Party and League member participating in the planning work should formulate guarantee conditions for compiling a good plan, in order to drive the masses to do a good job in planning work. Factory and mine Party organizations should hold various symposiums to grasp the situation and listen to opinions, and mobilize planning personnel to compare the plans of each pithead, mining area, and workshop, launch criticism, and exchange experiences. The factory and mine Party Committee should also lead the trade union to launch rationalization proposals in conjunction with the current labor competition, instruct each branch to organize investigation teams to investigate methods related to increasing production, practicing economy, and ensuring safety, and the factory and mine Party Committee should convene a "Technical Organization Measures Conference" on this basis to mobilize everyone to launch discussions in order to enrich the administrative technical organization measures plan.
	
	Correcting the Impatient and Rash Tendency in Building Cooperatives
	At the end of October, the CPC Jining County Committee in Inner Mongolia convened an enlarged conference of county, district, and township three-level cadres, criticizing the impatient and rash tendency in developing agricultural production cooperatives before and after the autumn harvest, as well as the commandist style of some cadres. In the conference discussion, the Jining County Committee used many facts to illustrate the bad consequences of impatience and rashness to educate cadres. For example, one cooperative in Jianhua Township was established under the impatient mood of the cadres. Not long after the cadres left the village, the peasants withdrew from the cooperative one after another, leaving only 19 households out of 103 members. After analyzing the first batch of newly built and expanded cooperatives, the Jining County Committee decided to strengthen education for farmers who have signed up to join the cooperative but are not firm in their thinking; for farmers with greater concerns, they must be clearly informed of the policies so that they can decide whether to stay or leave based on the principle of voluntariness. The Jining County Committee required that cooperatives that have already set up the framework but have not conducted the "Four Appraisals" should carefully review the requirements of the farmers who joined the cooperative and prudently handle the issue of production materials joining the cooperative; if there are unreasonable points in the "Four Appraisals" that have been carried out, they should be reached reasonably through democratic discussion.

    各地党组织的活动
    向基层党组织传达四中全会决议
    中共沈阳市委领导全市党组织深入贯彻党的七届四中全会决议。中共沈阳市北关、南市、大东等区委员会在十一月九日至十八日先后召开了代表大会，传达和贯彻党的七届四中全会决议，检查区委会的工作。中共南市区委的第一次代表大会在沈阳市委的直接领导下，不但总结和检查了区委会的工作，还交流了党的基层组织工作经验。大会自始至终充满了民主团结的气氛和批评和自我批评的精神。
    中共沈阳市委员会并决定从今年第四季度开始到明年第二季度末，利用党日及工人政治教育的时间，向全市工厂、企业、机关、学校的全体党员、青年团员深入地系统地进行四中全会决议的教育。沈阳市委已经统一编写了教材。各级党组织已基本上聘好了教员，安排好了教学时间。绝大多数单位，正在积极研究教学和辅导工作，并具体制订教学计划。五三工厂、东北工学院、皇姑屯机车车辆修理工厂等单位的党组织已开始学习。
    及时批判骄傲自满情绪
    云南纺织厂九月份重点推行了周作业计划，完成任务情况比过去有了进步。很多车间由此产生了骄傲自满情绪。中共云南纺织厂委员会发现这个问题后，在十月二十八日召开了全厂党员代表会议，发动全党批判骄傲自满情绪。党员代表都检查了自己工作中的问题。如有的车间支部书记原来自以为自己车间的计划已经编得不错，因此，十月份编计划时就没有接受行政领导方面提出的降低车子速度的指示，使十月上、中旬二十三支纱的计划完成得不均衡。有的车间支部检查了过去强调特殊，不愿推行周作业计划的错误思想。有的代表批判自己认为推行周作业计划后，因为完成计划较好而自满的思想，表示要用实际行动带动群众努力完成和超额完成国家计划。会议决议：今后应继续深入学习四中全会决议，批判资产阶级个人主义骄傲自满情绪，以保证完成第四季度国家计划。
    重视对劳动模范的教育
    十一月十三日，中共天津铁路运输分局委员会召开了劳动模范、先进工作者大会。会议中检查出有些劳动模范和先进工作者滋长着骄傲自满、夸耀自己甚至不认真执行命令、不虚心学习先进经验等不良倾向。比如，有一个模范青年包车组的司机长在担任乘务时睡觉，以致发生冒进信号的恶性事故。天津站运转丙班第二模范调车组违章作业，造成车辆冲突的大事故。参加会议的党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部都检讨了自己对劳动模范培养教育不够的缺点，认为这是劳动模范骄傲自满的主要原因。有的单位对于巩固和提高劳动模范的政治思想水平的重大意义认识不足，对这一工作的领导一般化，只有布置，缺少检查。有的单位对劳动模范的培养没有明确的分工和制度，不了解他们的思想情况和工作中的困难。不少劳动模范和先进工作者，在会议上对自己的骄傲情绪作了检查和批判，表示今后一定改正错误，密切联系群众，发挥带头和骨干作用，以保证完成增产节约计划。在这次会议上制订出对劳动模范和先进工作者的培养办法，并规定：党委应该把这一工作列入自己的议事日程，指定党委委员一人负责。会议并要求各单位保证劳动模范的政治技术学习时间。
    加强对新党员的教育
    中共武汉市江岸区委最近举办了业余党课讲座，对在防汛斗争中发展的新党员和积极分子进行党的基本知识教育。并以工厂为单位，向已具有党的基础知识的一般党员进行以总路线为内容的党课教育。党课教育是紧密地结合中心工作进行的，因此，提高了党员社会主义觉悟并推动了生产。如武汉火柴厂小包部工人吴远书（党员）、撤板部工人陈道洪（党员），过去总是完不成生产计划。这次他们学习了党的基本知识，提高了觉悟，现在都能完成计划了。
    江岸区委对党课教育非常重视，把它列入区委的工作计划，并规定了党课日。区委书记、委员都担任了党课教员。很多工厂党组织也把党课教育列为党委或支部的重要工作之一，派专人负责管理。区委还领导党课教员进行集体备课，帮助解决教学中的具体困难，以提高讲课质量。
    加强编制计划中的政治工作
    在抚顺市委领导下，中共抚顺矿务局委员会召集了矿务局所属的十三个厂矿党委书记开会，向大家介绍苏联企业党组织在编制计划中的政治工作经验，要求加强编制明年生产财务计划中的政治工作，改变过去年年计划保守的现象。矿务局党委要求每个厂矿党委派一个较强的专职干部参加各厂矿编制计划委员会，自始至终地了解编制计划工作的情况，帮助参加编制计划工作的党、团员组成临时的党和青年团支部，在编制计划人员中进行思想教育工作。每个参加编制计划工作的党、团员应该订出编好计划的保证条件，以带动群众做好编制计划工作。厂矿党组织应该召开各种座谈会掌握情况听取意见，并发动编制计划人员将各坑口、采区、车间的计划进行评比，展开批评，交流经验。厂矿党委并应领导工会结合当前的劳动竞赛，发动群众提合理化建议，指示各支部组织调查小组，调查有关增加生产、厉行节约和保证安全的办法，厂矿党委在这个基础上召开“技术组织措施大会”，动员大家展开讨论，以充实行政方面的技术组织措施计划。
    纠正建社中的急躁冒进倾向
    中共内蒙古集宁县委在十月底召开了县区乡三级扩大干部会议，批判了秋收前后发展农业生产合作社中的急躁冒进倾向，及部分干部的强迫命令作风。在会议讨论中，集宁县委用许多事实说明急躁冒进的不良后果，以教育干部。比如，建华乡的一个社就是在干部的急躁情绪下建立起来的，建社干部离村不久，农民就纷纷退社，一百零三户社员只剩下十九户了。在分析了第一批新建社和扩建社后，集宁县委决定对已报名入社而思想不坚定的农民要加强教育；对顾虑较大的农民，必须向他们讲清政策，使他们根据自愿原则决定去留。集宁县委要求已搭好架子而没有进行“四评”的社，要细致地审查入社农民的要求，慎重处理生产资料入社问题；已进行过“四评”的社，如果“四评”中有不合理的地方，要经过民主讨论达到合理。
