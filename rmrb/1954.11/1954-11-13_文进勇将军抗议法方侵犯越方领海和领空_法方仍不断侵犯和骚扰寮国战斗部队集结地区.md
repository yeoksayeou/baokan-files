Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, on November 5th, the representative of the Vietnamese People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee in Vietnam sent a memorandum to the representative of the French Union Forces, strongly protesting the French side's violation of the ceasefire agreement and its continuous infringement of Vietnamese airspace and territorial waters in the Ninh Binh and Nam Dinh provinces.

The memorandum pointed out that on October 5th, 14th, and 18th, French military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Nam Dinh Province on three occasions, circling for reconnaissance or using loudspeakers to call on local residents to move south. On October 14th and 15th, French military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Ninh Binh Province on four occasions.

At the same time, French ships also intruded into the territorial waters of the liberated areas. From October 15th to 20th, three French ships approached the sea off Nam Dinh Province. These ships also used loudspeakers on the evening of the 19th to entice residents on the mainland to go to South Vietnam. On October 24th and 25th, for two consecutive days, three other ships sailed near the aforementioned area. On November 1st and 2nd, two French gunboats intruded into the waters off Nam Dinh Province.

The aforementioned military threats seriously infringed upon the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and were serious acts of sabotage of the ceasefire agreement.

These acts, coupled with the French Union Forces' connivance with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in infringing upon the people's lives and democratic freedoms, once again prove that the French Union Forces do not wish to create a favorable atmosphere for the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; on the contrary, they are making the situation more complicated.

The Vietnamese People's Army lodged a strong protest against this sabotage and demanded that the French Union Forces immediately end these infringements.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 11th, French ships and aircraft continue to intrude into the territorial waters and airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. From October 15th to November 8th, another seventeen French ships intruded into the territorial waters of the liberated areas of Nam Dinh and Thai Binh provinces; during the same period, ten French aircraft intruded into the airspace over Lang Son, Ninh Binh, and Hai Duong provinces.

General Wen Jinyong, representative of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, handed a second memorandum to General De Brebisson, representative of the General Command of the French Union Forces, on November 10th, protesting these violations of the ceasefire agreement and infringements upon the territorial sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the French side.

The memorandum stated: We once again lodge a strong protest against these violations of the agreement and demand that the General Command of the French Union Forces immediately respond. We also believe it is necessary to point out that if the aforementioned violations of the agreement continue to occur, the General Command of the French Union Forces must bear full responsibility for any unforeseen events.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, northern Laos, 10th dispatch: The French Union Forces side continues to infringe upon and harass the Lao battle force assembly areas in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces.

On November 4th, armed bandits under French command invaded from Ma Ri Dao and occupied the Wu Nu Airport, seventy kilometers northwest of Phongsaly. On the same day, one hundred armed bandits, under the command of three French officers, looted the Mang Kho area and captured the chairman of the local administrative committee.

Prior to this, on September 26th, one hundred armed bandits under French command invaded Hongmen in Sam Neua Province and attacked the stationing area of the Lao battle forces. On October 4th, the French Union Forces side dispatched five hundred armed bandits, mostly composed of remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gangs, to loot Wu Nu in Phongsaly Province, setting fire to the entire village and killing and wounding civilians.

The above-mentioned acts once again prove that the French Union Forces side has not correctly implemented the ceasefire agreement and is still harassing the Lao battle force assembly areas, attempting to partially occupy Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces. And the recent provocations occurred after the leaders of the Lao battle forces reiterated their desire for peace and expressed their spirit of cooperation, which is even more serious. The French Union Forces side should bear full responsibility for these provocative acts.

    文进勇将军抗议法方侵犯越方领海和领空
    法方仍不断侵犯和骚扰寮国战斗部队集结地区
   【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：十一月五日，驻越南中央联合停战委员会的越南人民军代表送给法兰西联邦部队代表一件备忘录，强硬抗议法方违反停战协定，连续侵犯宁平和南定省地区的越方领空、领海的行为。
    备忘录指出，在十月五日、十四日、十八日，有法军飞机三架次侵入南定省上空盘旋侦察或用广播器叫当地居民南迁。在十月十四日、十五日，有法军飞机四架次侵入宁平省上空。
    同时，法国舰船也侵入解放区的领海。从十月十五日到二十日，有三只法国船驶近南定省的海面，这些船只并在十九日晚用扩音器劝诱大陆上的居民到南越去。十月二十四日和二十五日连续两天，另外又有三只船在前述地区附近行驶。十一月一日和二日，有两艘法国炮艇侵入南定省水面。
    上述的军事威胁行为，严重地侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权，是破坏停战协定的严重行为。
    这些行为，加上法兰西联邦部队纵容吴庭艳集团侵害人民的生命和民主自由，就再次证明法兰西联邦部队并不希望为履行停战协定建立有利气氛，相反却使得局势更加复杂化。
    越南人民军对这种破坏行为提出强硬抗议，并要求法兰西联邦部队立即结束这些侵犯行为。
    【新华社十二日讯】据越南通讯社十一日讯：法方的船舰和飞机继续侵犯越南民主共和国的领海和领空。从十月十五日到十一月八日，又有十七艘法方船舰侵入南定省和太平省解放区的领海；在同一期间，十架法国飞机侵入谅山、宁平和海阳等省的上空。
    越南人民军总司令部代表文进勇将军十一月十日把第二份备忘录交给法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表德布勒比松将军，就法方这些违反停战协定，侵犯越南民主共和国领土主权的行为提出抗议。
    备忘录说：我们再一次对这些违反协定的行为提出强硬抗议，并且要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部立即答复。我们还认为必须指出，如果上述这些违反协定的行为继续发生的话，法兰西联邦部队总司令部必须对任何不测事件承担全部责任。
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社老挝北部十日讯：法兰西联邦部队方面仍在不断侵犯和骚扰丰沙里省和桑怒省寮国战斗部队集结地区。
    十一月四日，法方指挥下的武装匪徒从马里刀进犯，占领了丰沙里西北七十公里的乌怒机场。同日，一百名武装匪徒在三名法国军官的指挥下，抢劫了芒苛地区，捕去了当地行政委员会的主席。
    在此以前，九月二十六日，法方指挥下的一百名武装匪徒曾侵入桑怒省的鸿门，袭击寮国战斗部队的驻地。十月四日，法兰西联邦部队方面派遣了五百名大部分由蒋介石残余匪帮组成的武装匪徒抢劫丰沙里省的乌怒，放火烧了整个村庄，杀死和打伤平民。
    上述行为再一次证明，法兰西联邦部队方面并没有正确地履行停战协定，仍在骚扰寮国战斗部队集结地区，企图部分地占领丰沙里省和桑怒省。而最近的挑衅行为发生在寮国战斗部队领导人重申热望和平和表示合作精神之后，这就更加严重。法兰西联邦部队方面应该对这些挑衅行为负完全责任。
