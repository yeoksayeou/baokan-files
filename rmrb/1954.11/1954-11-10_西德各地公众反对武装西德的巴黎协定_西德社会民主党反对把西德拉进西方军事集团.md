Xinhua News Agency, November 9th: Berlin dispatch: As the date for the Bonn Federal Assembly's debate on the Paris Agreements regarding the arming of West Germany draws nearer, the public in various parts of West Germany is increasingly resolutely demanding the rejection of this conspiracy that endangers the cause of peace and the reunification of Germany.

In West Germany, only one party—the Christian Democratic Union—unconditionally agrees with the agreements that Adenauer signed in Paris. Other parties, to varying degrees, are opposing Adenauer's policies. This fact reflects the growing dissatisfaction of the West German public with the policies of the Bonn Chancellor.

Residents from all walks of life in West Germany are taking action against the militarization of West Germany.

Eight thousand people in Hamburg, under the call of the German Communist Party, held a march to celebrate the Soviet October Socialist Revolution, oppose the London and Paris agreements, and demand the establishment of collective security in Europe and the reunification of Germany. The Heilbronn branch of the West German Food Industry Workers' Union, at its recent meeting, passed a resolution demanding that all party parliamentary groups in the Federal Assembly unanimously reject the Paris agreements. The leadership of the railway workers' union in Kornwestheim (Stuttgart) recently also issued a statement condemning the Paris agreements and supporting sincere negotiations between the peoples of Eastern and Western countries.

A factory committee against conscription has recently been established at the Hanna shear iron factory in Grossenbaum, near Duisburg.

At the Schliepmann factory in Solingen, workers passed a resolution refusing to engage in arms production.

Metalworkers in the Pungartz agricultural machine factory in Munich demanded the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation against re-militarization.

Cadres of the Bremenhafen metalworkers' union called on trade unions in all industries to call for demonstrations against West German re-militarization.

The sentiment against conscription is particularly strong among West German youth. In Solingen, young people have established a preparatory committee against West German re-militarization and against the conscription of West German youth, and they have decided to hold a mass rally against rearmament and against conscription on December 5th. A recent conference of young miners in Düsseldorf also passed a resolution calling on the leadership of the West German Trade Union Federation to intensify action against West German re-militarization and against the recruitment of young people into the new "Bundeswehr". On November 3rd, personnel from the Bonn government's "Blank Department" (War Department) organized a meeting in the waiting room of the Cologne train station to encourage West German youth to join the future fascist mercenary army. At the meeting, many young people spoke out to question the personnel of the "Blank Department" about why West German youth should be sent to their deaths, and they condemned the war preparation policies of the United States and West Germany. Many young people demanded the reunification of Germany in their speeches. Representatives of the "Blank Department" were unable to answer these questions, and they retreated from the meeting in embarrassment amid the protests of the masses.

In addition, two hundred and forty-five prominent figures from West German intellectual circles jointly wrote a letter to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, demanding a solution to the German question through negotiations. Those who signed the letter included painters, teachers, university professors, theater directors, sculptors, pastors, scientists, doctors, engineers, orchestra conductors, and opera singers.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Bonn dispatch: West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, in a radio address in Hamburg on the 4th, pointed out that the Paris Agreements, which pull West Germany into the Western military bloc, carry the danger of exacerbating international tensions.

Ollenhauer said: "We are faced with a situation that has the danger of widening the rift between Germany (East and West Germany) and Europe."

Ollenhauer said: The Paris Agreements continue the policies of Chancellor Adenauer, the aim of which is to make West Germany a permanent state, not脱离 [tuōlí - break away/ be divorced from] the originally stipulated temporary structure.

Prior to giving this speech, Ollenhauer said at a meeting of the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group on the 2nd that the Paris Agreements were in conflict with the reunification of Germany through negotiations. He demanded a discussion of the Soviet note of October 23rd.

The Social Democratic Party, which holds nearly one-third of the seats in the Bonn Federal Assembly, poses a threat that cannot be ignored to the policies of the Adenauer ruling group with its opposition to the London and Paris Agreements.

    西德各地公众反对武装西德的巴黎协定
    西德社会民主党反对把西德拉进西方军事集团
    【新华社九日讯】柏林消息：由于波恩联邦议院辩论关于武装西德的巴黎各项协定的日期愈来愈近，西德各地公众日益坚决地要求拒绝这种危害和平事业和德国的重新统一的阴谋。
    西德只有一个政党——基督教民主联盟——无条件地同意阿登纳在巴黎签订的各项协定。其他政党或多或少地都在反对阿登纳的政策。这一事实反映出西德公众对于波恩总理的政策日益感到不满。
    西德各阶层的居民正在采取行动，反对西德军国主义化。
    汉堡八千人在德国共产党的号召下举行了游行以庆祝苏联十月社会主义革命节，反对伦敦和巴黎协议，并要求建立欧洲的集体安全和重新统一德国。西德食品工业工人工会海尔布隆分会在最近举行的会议上通过了一项决议，要求联邦议院各党派议会党团一致拒绝巴黎协议。柯伦威斯海姆（斯图加特）的铁路工人工会的领导机构最近也发表声明，谴责巴黎协议，赞成在东西方各国人民之间举行真诚的谈判。
    在杜伊斯堡附近的格罗森堡姆的汉那舍铁工厂中最近建立了一个反对征兵的工厂委员会。
    在索林根的施连帕工厂，工人们通过决议，拒绝进行军火生产。
    慕尼黑的旁加兹农业机器工厂中的五金工人要求贯彻执行西德工会联合会第三次代表大会关于反对重新军国主义化的决议。
    不来梅港五金工人工会的干部要求各行各业的工会号召举行反对西德重新军国主义化的示威。
    西德青年反对征兵的情绪特别强烈。在索林根，青年们建立了一个反对西德重新军国主义化和反对征召西德青年入伍的筹备委员会，他们决定在十二月五日举行一次反对重新武装和反对征兵的群众集会。最近在杜塞尔多夫举行的青年矿工会议也通过了一项决议，要求西德工会联合会领导机构加紧行动，反对西德重新军国主义化和反对征募青年参加新的“国防军”。十一月三日，波恩政府“布兰克部”（战争部）的人员在科隆市火车站的候车室中组织了一次劝告西德青年参加未来的法西斯雇佣军的集会，会上，许多青年发言质问“布兰克部”的人员，为什么要让西德青年去送死，他们并且谴责美国和西德的备战政策，许多青年在发言中要求统一德国。“布兰克部”的代表对这些质问无辞以答，他们在群众的抗议声中狼狈地退出会场。
    此外，二百四十五个西德知识界的著名人物联名写信给苏、法、英、美四大国外长，要求通过谈判解决德国问题。在信上署名的有画家、教员、大学教授、剧院导演、雕刻家、牧师、科学家、医生、工程师、乐队指挥和歌剧演员等。
      【新华社八日讯】波恩消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔四日在汉堡发表广播演说，指出把西德拉进西方军事集团的巴黎协定有加剧国际紧张局势的危险。
    奥伦豪尔说：“我们面临着一个有扩大德国
  （东西德之间）和欧洲的裂口的危险的局势”。
    奥伦豪尔说：巴黎协定继续了阿登纳总理的政策，这个政策的目的是使西德成为一个永久性的国家，不脱离原来规定的临时结构的状态。
    在发表这篇演说之前，奥伦豪尔二日在社会民主党议会党团会议上说：巴黎协定是和通过谈判重新统一德国相抵触的。他要求讨论十月二十三日的苏联照会。
    在波恩联邦议院拥有几近三分之一议席的社会民主党对于伦敦和巴黎协定的反对态度，对于阿登纳统治集团的政策，形成了一个不可忽视的威胁。
