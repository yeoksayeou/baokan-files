Hebei Province has been rectifying and improving primary education work since the spring of this year, and it is now basically completed. More than 40,100 primary schools have been systematically rectified and improved, accounting for 91.73 percent of the total number of primary schools. By implementing the Central Committee's policy of controlling the development and consolidating primary education, the tendency of blind development has been overcome. At the same time, key development has been carried out in cities and mining areas, and privately-run primary schools have been promoted, solving the problem of enrollment for some children of workers and peasants.

During the rectification process, 1,700 teachers were promoted to principals or directors of teaching affairs in 151 counties (cities) including Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tongxian, and Dingxian, strengthening school leadership. More than 630 outstanding teachers were also selected and sent to universities for study. 17,000 graduates of normal schools were assigned to primary schools to teach. For teachers with lower levels of competence, leadership was strengthened in in-service training, or they were sent to normal schools for study or given rotational training based on specific circumstances; some were reassigned to other jobs.

After the rectification, grassroots cadres, teachers, and the masses in various localities initially clarified that the central task of the school is teaching, and chaotic phenomena inside and outside the school have been overcome. In teaching, teachers have emphasized lesson preparation. Currently, most teachers in higher primary schools and complete primary schools have lesson plans, and teachers in junior primary schools have teaching notes. A new atmosphere of studying professional skills has also emerged in many areas. Primary school teachers in Shahe County have organized 56 teaching research groups. In order to enhance teaching effectiveness, teachers and students in various places have increased the production of teaching aids. More than 4,100 primary schools in Handan Prefecture have collected and made more than 30,100 teaching aids. Students' academic performance has also improved significantly.

Through this rectification and improvement work, primary school teachers have studied the general task of the country during the transition period and emphasized labor education for students. Through classroom teaching, extracurricular activities, team life, visits, inviting labor models to give speeches, discussions, and cooperating with relevant departments to publicize "labor is glorious" to students' parents and cadres, students' erroneous ideas of despising labor have been reversed. Among the more than 189,000 higher primary school graduates in 128 counties and cities including Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tongxian, and Dingxian, 93.73 percent of those who did not continue their studies or stay in their original schools to study further participated in industrial and agricultural production.

    河北省整顿和改进小学教育
    河北省从今年春季开始整顿和改进小学教育工作，现已基本结束。经过系统整顿、改进的小学共四万一百多个，占小学总数的百分之九十一点七三。由于贯彻了中央对小学教育控制发展、进行巩固的方针，克服了盲目发展的倾向。同时在市、矿区进行了重点发展，提倡民办小学，解决了部分工农子女入学问题。
    在整顿过程中，保定、石家庄、通县、定县等一百五十一个县（市）提拔了教师一千七百多人担任了校长或教导主任，加强了学校领导。还选送了六百三十多名优秀教师到高等学校学习。分配了初师毕业生一万七千名到小学任教学工作。对水平较低不能称职的教师，加强了在职学习的领导，或根据具体情况进入师范学校学习或施行轮训；部分作了转业安置。
    经过整顿，各地基层干部、教师、群众初步明确了学校的中心任务是教学，校内、外的混乱现象克服了。在教学工作上，教师重视了备课。目前高小和完小的大部分教师有课时计划，初小教师有了教学笔记。不少地区还出现了研究业务的新风气。沙河县的小学教师们组织了五十六个教学研究小组。为增强教学效果，各地师生都增制教具。邯郸专区四千一百多个小学，就搜集和自制教具三万一百多件。学生学习成绩也有显著提高。
    通过这次整顿改进工作，小学教师学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务，重视了对学生的劳动教育。通过课堂教学、课外活动、团队生活、参观、邀请劳动模范讲演、座谈讨论，和配合有关部门对学生家长、干部宣传“劳动光荣”，学生轻视劳动的错误思想已有扭转。保定、石家庄、通县、定县等一百二十八个县、市的十八万九千多名高小毕业生，除升学深造和留原校学习的以外，参加工、农业生产的有百分之九十三点七三。　　　　（新华社）
