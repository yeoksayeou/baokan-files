    Since the start of the new academic year, the number of students in Tianjin's six universities has increased to 10,700, a 32.3 percent increase compared to the previous semester. Many of these are students from worker and peasant backgrounds. Among the more than 1,600 new students at Tianjin University, 101 are from worker and peasant backgrounds or graduates of worker-peasant rapid courses.

    After the new students enrolled, the heads of each school introduced the school's situation to them. Nankai University organized symposiums for new and old students, where senior students enthusiastically introduced the nature of their majors and their learning experiences to the new students. The Academic Affairs Office also held a special exchange meeting on first-year teaching experience to improve the quality of first-year teaching in each department. Shortly after the start of the semester, first-year students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tianjin University experienced problems such as excessive study stress. The department office and the Communist Youth League organized fourth-year students to introduce their good methods and experiences in learning to the new students, helping them to overcome difficulties. Tianjin University also established special tutoring classes in mathematics and physics for worker and peasant students. Teachers often used individual tutoring methods to help them overcome learning difficulties. The new students also demonstrated a spirit of unity and mutual assistance. Zhang Yixia, a first-year student in the English Department of Nankai University, was originally a cadre in a government office and encountered many difficulties in her studies. Her classmates Xu Erwei, Wu Bing, and others helped her with her studies, lent her their notes, and sometimes patiently explained things to her.

    天津各高等学校
    积极帮助新生学习
    新学年开始后，天津六所高等学校学生已经增加到一万零七百多人，比上学期增加了百分之三十二点三。其中有不少是工农出身的学生，天津大学的一千六百多名新生中，就有一百零一人是工农出身或工农速成中学毕业的学生。
    新生入学后，各校负责人都向新生介绍了学校的情况。南开大学组织了新老学生座谈会，老学生热情地向新生介绍专业性质和学习经验，教务处还专门召开了一年级教学经验交流会，以提高各系一年级教学质量。天津大学机械工程系一年级学生在开学后不久，曾发生了学习过度紧张等问题，系办公室和青年团就组织四年级学生向新生介绍他们学习上的好方法和体会，帮助新生克服困难。天津大学还特别为工农学生成立了数学和物理补习班，教师们经常用个别辅导的办法帮助他们克服学习上的困难。新生们也发挥了团结互助的精神。南开大学英文专业一年级学生张一侠原来是机关干部，学习上遇到不少困难，她的同学徐尔维、吴冰等就帮助她学习，借笔记给她看，有时还耐心地给她讲解。  （新华社）
