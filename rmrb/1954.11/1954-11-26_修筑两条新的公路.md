    Construction of the highway from Jiaoshui in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, to Yabulai Salt Lake in Alxa League has been officially opened to traffic. Now, large quantities of edible salt are being transported outwards. This highway is 137 kilometers long, and its southern end is connected to the Ganxin Highway and the Lanxin Railway.

    The Yabulai Salt Lake has abundant salt reserves and good quality, mainly supplying the needs of the people of Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. In the past, it was transported by camel, and the annual transportation time was very short, the transportation volume was limited, and the cost was high. Now, cars have replaced camels. Just by using cars, more than twice as much edible salt can be transported out each year. In addition, Alxa League's local products and animal products can also be transported to other places via this highway, and large quantities of industrial products and daily necessities can also be transported to Alxa League.

    Hubei Province is building a highway from Enshi to Lichuan. This highway will pass through high mountains and ridges from Lichuan to Enshi, and then connect with the Badong highway and the Yangtze River shipping through Enshi. Farmers in the mountainous area of Enshi are happily participating in the road construction project, and migrant workers from neighboring Hunan and Sichuan provinces have also come to support. It is expected that the entire line will be officially opened to traffic by the end of January next year.

    The construction of the En(shi)-Li(chuan) highway is a component of the plan to develop the large mountainous area in western Hubei Province. The western Hubei mountainous area is rich in products. In addition to producing rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and oil crops, it also abounds in tung oil, raw lacquer, gallnuts, and various medicinal materials, walnut kernels, mushrooms, and other mountain products. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, this place formed a dead corner in urban-rural material exchanges. According to a survey by the Hubei Provincial Highway Bureau, Lichuan County alone had nearly 20 million jin of "dead corner grain" that could not be transported out in 1952.

    修筑两条新的公路
    甘肃省永昌县窖水到阿拉善旗雅布赖盐池的公路已经正式通车。现在大量食盐正源源向外运输。这条公路全长一百三十七公里，它的南端和甘新公路、兰新铁路相连结。
    雅布赖盐池的盐的蕴藏量丰富，质量也好，主要供应甘、陕两省人民需要。过去用骆驼驮运，每年驮运时间很短，运输量有限，成本又高。现在，汽车代替了骆驼。光是用汽车，每年就可以多运出一倍的食盐。此外，阿拉善旗的土产和畜产品也可经过这条公路向外地运销，大批工业品和生活必需品也能运到阿拉善旗去。　（新华社）
    湖北省正在修建一条从恩施到利川的公路。这条公路将从利川穿过崇山峻岭通往恩施，再经过恩施到巴东的公路和长江航运沟通。恩施山区的农民们欢欣鼓舞地参加了修路工程，湖南、四川两省邻近的民工也赶来支援。预计明年一月底全线可以正式通车。
  恩（施）利（川）公路的兴建，是开发湖北省西部大山区计划中的一个组成部分。鄂西山区物产丰富，除了产稻谷、小麦、杂粮和油料外，还盛产桐油、生漆、五棓子和各种药材、核桃仁、香菌及其他山货。过去苦于交通不便，这里形成城乡物资交流中的死角。据湖北省公路局的调查，利川县仅在一九五二年就有近两千万斤的“死角粮”运不出来。  （新华社）
