To exploit more coal to supply the needs of industrial production, coal mine infrastructure construction is being stepped up.

    Jixi Coal Mine Reconstructing Existing Mines

    Jixi Coal Mine is implementing a large-scale plan to restore and reconstruct its existing mines. Upon completion of this plan, the annual raw coal production of the entire mine, excluding new mines, will increase by approximately 60% compared to the current annual output. The restoration projects for four mines, including Hengshan Mine's Sixth Pit First Incline, Fourth Pit Third Incline, and Mashan Mine's Seventh Pit, and Muling Mine's Eleventh Horizontal Tunnel, which have been abandoned for many years, have commenced. The reconstruction of some of the mines in Hengshan and Didao mines, which began construction this year, is also actively underway.

    The Jixi Coal Mine's restoration and reconstruction plan was determined after a detailed investigation and study of the geological conditions of the existing mines, with the specific assistance of Soviet experts. The investigation proved that not only can the existing producing mines in Jixi greatly extend their coal mining lifespan, but also that many of the abandoned mines still have remaining coal that can continue to be mined.

    Shuangyashan Lingxi Vertical Shaft Nears Completion

    The Shuangyashan Lingxi Vertical Shaft is nearing completion. The ground buildings and installation work required for the vertical shaft have been completed. A group of young production workers has entered the factory buildings and is operating the brand-new large winches, air compressors, and various mechanical equipment together with the construction workers. Underground, the finishing touches are being carried out intensely. Concrete roadways in the pit-bottom yard have been laid with mine car tracks, and electric lights and various signal markers have been installed along the railway lines. The roadway construction in the mining area is also nearing completion. The Shuangyashan Lingxi Vertical Shaft began construction in October 1952, and the entire construction period is only over two years, making it the fastest pair of vertical shafts built in our country.

    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Winter Construction

    The construction project of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine has completed nearly nine-tenths of this year's work, of which 43 projects have been completed and handed over to the production department. The construction focus this year—the coal storage warehouse project—which only started construction in August, had its main concrete portions all poured by November 15th. Recently, the workers have thrown themselves into intense winter construction in the severe cold.

    Since the partial handover of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine to production last year on "July 1st," the uncompleted construction workload still accounted for about two-thirds of the total original design engineering volume. This year's construction investment is approximately equal to seven-tenths of the total construction investment of the past four years. This year's projects are not only large in scale but also relatively complex and arduous. After the completion of these projects, more coal can be produced to supply industrial construction.

    Tongchuan and Other Coal Mines Designing New and Reconstructed Mines

    Northwest State-owned Tongchuan Coal Mine and Gansu Mining Bureau's Aganzhen Coal Mine and Shmengou Coal Mine are preparing to build, reconstruct, and restore nine pairs of mines. After the completion of these mines, the total annual output of various state-owned coal mines in the Northwest will reach about six times this year's output. Currently, the basic construction plan for Tongchuan Coal Mine for next year has been prepared. The design of various projects is being accelerated. The drawings of mine cars and metal headframes required for the construction of mines next year have also been designed and will be handed over to the Northwest Mining Machinery Repair and Assembly Plant for manufacturing. This winter, more than 400 construction workers will participate in winter training. The Northwest Coal Mining Administration also plans to hold a short-term training class, drawing some workers to learn well-digging and the technology of operating various machines to strengthen the construction force.

    Jiaozuo Coal Mine: One Mine Nears Handover to Production

    One of the key coal mine construction projects—Jiaozuo Coal Mine's No. 39 well—is nearing handover to production after a year of restoration. The main underground projects of the mine have all been completed, and roadways totaling more than 4,600 meters in length are densely distributed underground like spiderwebs. The spacious transportation roadways have been laid with neat rails and belt conveyors. The coal mining faces of the first mining area have also been fully opened up. Now, the workers on the ground are working hard to install the machinery for the overpass and coal bunker.

    The entire production process of Jiaozuo Coal Mine's No. 39 well, from coal mining, coal transportation, coal preparation to loading, will be fully mechanized. A large number of excellent workers in this mine are now further studying and mastering the performance and operation methods of the new types of machines. Management cadres are also working hard to familiarize themselves with all aspects of the situation and business, preparing to receive production. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 开采更多的煤供应工业生产需要  煤矿基本建设加紧进行

    开采更多的煤供应工业生产需要
    煤矿基本建设加紧进行
    鸡西煤矿改建现有矿井
    鸡西煤矿正在执行着一项规模很大的恢复和改建现有矿井的计划。这项计划完成后，全矿每年生产的原煤，不包括新建矿井在内，将比现在的年产量增长百分之六十左右。其中，停废了多年的恒山矿六坑一斜、四坑三斜和麻山矿的七坑、穆棱矿的十一号水平洞等四个矿井的恢复工程，已经先后开工。恒山、滴道两矿今年动工改建的一部分矿井，也正在积极施工。
    鸡西煤矿的恢复改建计划是在苏联专家的具体帮助下，详细地调查和研究了现有矿井的地质情况以后确定的。调查证明：鸡西各矿不但现有生产矿井可以大大延长采煤年限，就是那些已经停废了的矿井，也有很多残存的煤可以继续开采。
    双鸭山岭西竖井快建成
    双鸭山岭西竖井快要建成。竖井所需的地面建筑和安装工程都完工了。一批年轻的生产工人已进入厂房，和建设工人们一起操纵着崭新的大绞车、压风机和各种机械设备。在井下，收尾工程正在紧张进行。井底车场的混凝土巷道上已铺设了矿车轨道，安装好了沿铁道线的电灯和各种信号标志。采区的巷道工程也快完工了。双鸭山岭西竖井是一九五二年十月开始建设的，全部建设期只有两年多，是我国建设竖井以来进度最快的一对竖井。
    阜新海州露天矿冬季施工
    阜新海州露天煤矿今年的建设工程已完成了近十分之九，其中有四十三项工程已经完工移交给生产部门。今年八月才开工的建设重点——储煤仓工程，到十一月十五日止，主要部分的混凝土已全部浇灌完毕。近日来，职工们在严寒中投入了紧张的冬季施工。
    海州露天煤矿从去年“七一”部分移交生产后，未完工的建设工程量还占原设计工程量总数的三分之二左右。今年建设投资约等于过去四年建设投资总数的十分之七。今年的工程不仅规模大，而且比较复杂艰巨。这些工程完工后，就可以出更多的煤供应工业建设。
    铜川等煤矿设计新建改建矿井
    西北国营铜川煤矿和甘肃矿务局的阿干镇煤矿、石门沟煤矿正在着手准备新建、改建和恢复九对矿井。这些矿井建设完成后，西北各国营煤矿总的年产量将达到今年的六倍左右。现在，铜川煤矿明年的基本建设计划已经编制好了。各个工程的设计正在加速进行。明年建设矿井需用的矿车和金属井架的图样也已设计出来，将交给西北矿山机械修配厂制造。今冬将有四百多个建设工人参加冬训。西北煤矿管理局还计划举办一个短期训练班，抽调一部分工人学习凿井和操纵各种机械的技术，以增强施工力量。
  焦作煤矿一个矿井快移交生产
  煤矿建设重点工程之一——焦作煤矿三十九号井经过一年的恢复，现在快要移交生产了。矿井下面的主要工程已经全部完成，共长四千六百多公尺的巷道像蜘蛛网似的密布在井下，宽敞的运输巷道已铺上整齐的铁轨和皮带运输机。第一采区的采煤工作面也全部开辟出来了。现在，地面上的工人们正在紧张地进行天桥、煤仓的机械安装工作。
    焦作煤矿三十九号井从采煤、运煤、选煤到装车的整个生产过程将全部机械化。这个矿井的大批优秀工人，现在正进一步学习掌握新型机器的性能和操作方法；管理干部也正在努力熟悉各方面的情况和业务，准备接收生产。（据新华社讯）
