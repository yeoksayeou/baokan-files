The state is transferring grain from the Northeast to support the disaster areas in Anhui. Before December, the state plans to transfer 28,000 tons of sorghum and corn via Tianjia'an to Fengtai and other counties. Employees of water and land transportation departments have proposed "immediate transport upon arrival" and a guarantee of no grain loss during loading and unloading in order to quickly transport these grains to the disaster-stricken rural areas. Employees of the state-owned Anhui Province Huaihe River Shipping Company's Tianjia'an Shipping Office have also dredged the Xudianzui and Liugoukou shoals to ensure normal transportation during the dry season.

    东北调运粮食支援安徽灾区
    国家正从东北调运粮食支援安徽灾区。十二月份以前，国家计划由田家庵转运到凤台等县的高粱和玉米可达两万八千吨。水陆交通部门的员工为把这些粮食迅速运到灾区农村，提出了“随到随运”和装卸时不损失一粒粮的保证。国营安徽省淮河轮船公司田家庵航运办事处的员工，还开挖了许店咀、刘沟口两处浅滩，保证在枯水季节照常运输。（新华社）
