The Third Detachment of the Ministry of Forestry's Forest Survey will complete its survey work in the upper and middle reaches of the Bai Longjiang (White Dragon River) forest area in Gansu Province by the end of November.

The Bai Longjiang forest area is the largest forest area with timber reserves discovered in Gansu Province. The main trees are spruce, fir, and birch, generally more than one chi (foot, approx. 1/3 meter) thick and five or six zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) high, with some more than three chi thick and eight or nine zhang high. The development of this forest area will play a certain role in the country's economic construction.

Since entering the Bai Longjiang forest area, the staff of the Third Detachment of the Forest Survey has displayed a high degree of enthusiasm for labor. The mountains in the forest area are high and dangerous, generally more than 3,000 meters above sea level. In September, snow fell throughout the forest area, and the climate was cold. Due to the inconvenient transportation in the forest area, many difficulties arose in life. The heroic forest surveyors not only overcame these difficulties, but also created more than a dozen new working methods to improve work efficiency. As a result of adopting new working methods, the total average workload of cutting forest compartment lines increased from 86 meters per person per day in May to 274 meters per person per day in September, and tree measurement efficiency also increased threefold.

After the forest survey work in the upper and middle reaches of the Bai Longjiang River began, the local Tibetan people not only continuously supported the survey team staff in terms of living and transportation, but also more than 100 Tibetan youths directly participated in the forest survey work. The Tibetans called the forest surveyors "the team sent by Chairman Mao." The team members established a deep relationship with the Tibetans and received their strong support.

    白龙江林区调查工作将完成
    林业部森林调查第三大队在甘肃白龙江上、中游林区的调查工作，到十一月底，即可全面完成。
    白龙江林区是甘肃已发现的蕴藏木材最大的一个林区，主要树木有云杉、冷杉、桦木等，一般都有一尺多粗、五六丈高，还有三尺多粗、八九丈高的。这个林区开发后，对国家经济建设将起一定的作用。
    森林调查第三大队职工，自进入白龙江林区工作后，发挥了高度的劳动热情。林区的山又高又险，一般都在拔海三千公尺以上，九月，林区普遍落了雪，气候寒冷。由于林区交通不便，生活上也发生了许多困难。英勇的森林调查队员们不仅战胜了这些困难，而且为了提高工作效率，还创造了十多种新的工作方法。由于采用了新的工作方法，伐开林班线测量总平均工程量，由五月份每人每日八十六公尺提高到九月份每人每日二百七十四公尺，测树效率也提高了三倍。
    白龙江上、中游的森林调查工作开始后，当地藏族人民不仅从生活上、运输上不断支援调查队职工，而且还有一百多名藏族青年直接参加了森林调查工作。藏民们把森林调查队员叫“毛主席派来的队伍”。队员们和藏民们建立了深厚的感情，得到了藏民的大力支援。
