Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th dispatch: German democratic newspapers warmly welcome the Soviet government's new note proposing an all-European conference.
	“Neues Deutschland”’s editorial pointed out: The Soviet government's note was also sent to the government of the German Democratic Republic. This is because the German Democratic Republic is an independent European country. The newspaper emphasized that the German people especially welcome the holding of a European countries' conference on the establishment of a European collective security system before the issue of ratifying the London and Paris agreements is discussed in the parliaments of several Western European countries, that is, on November 29, because this is in line with their vital interests. The people of both East and West Germany should actively strive for the convening of the conference.
	The Christian Democratic Union's newspaper “Neue Zeit”’s editorial said: The Soviet government has once again warned that the ratification of the Paris agreements will greatly complicate the situation in Europe and make the solution of European problems, first and foremost the German problem, impossible. The governments of all European countries should recognize their responsibility at this history-making moment.
	The Free Democratic Party’s “Morgenpost” said: The Soviet proposal to convene an all-European conference is in line with the vital interests of every German patriot.
	"Tribune", "National-Zeitung", "Berliner Zeitung", "Junge Welt" and "Bauernecho", etc., also warmly welcomed the Soviet government's note in their editorials.
	According to Xinhua News Agency: Berlin dispatch: West German newspapers published the Soviet government's note proposing an all-European conference with considerable coverage and published commentaries.
	Some newspapers believe that the Soviet proposal cannot be rejected. Hamburg’s “Die Welt” said: “It is clear that the Soviet proposal for negotiations cannot be rejected outright.” “Frankfurter Rundschau” said: The Soviet proposal needs to be given the most serious consideration. The Soviet government has indicated that it wants to hold a European countries’ conference before the Paris agreements are ratified. Germans should not miss the opportunity to hold quick negotiations on the issue of restoring German unification, and no German has the right to agree to reject such negotiations.
	The Social Democratic Party's “Hamburger Echo” said: Moscow's recent diplomatic steps have already aroused "cautious optimism" in small countries. The newspaper pointed out: If the Paris agreements are implemented, the division of Germany will become a fait accompli, and the Eastern Bloc will take new measures to safeguard their security. The consequences of such a situation are self-evident.
	Even the Bonn government coalition’s newspaper “Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung”, published in Heidelberg, believes that negotiations must be held with Moscow, first and foremost to seek an acceptable solution to the German problem, thereby easing tensions in Europe.
	Other newspapers believe that the Soviet note is noteworthy. West Germany’s influential bourgeois newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" said: The Soviet note is a new step in Soviet policy.
	Many West German newspapers that oppose the Soviet proposal for the establishment of a European collective security system also pointed out that serious debate is required before rejecting the Soviet note.

    德国民主报纸欢迎苏联建议举行全欧会议
    许多西德报纸认为不能拒绝苏联建议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国民主报纸热烈地欢迎苏联政府建议召开全欧会议的新照会。
    “新德意志报”的社论指出：苏联政府的照会也送给了德意志民主共和国政府。这是因为德意志民主共和国是一个自主的欧洲国家。报纸着重指出：德国人民特别欢迎在若干西欧国家的议会讨论批准伦敦和巴黎协定的问题以前，也就是在十一月二十九日，举行关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的欧洲国家会议，因为这是符合他们的切身利益的。德国东西两部分的人民应该积极地为会议的召开而努力。
    基督教民主联盟的报纸“新时报”的社论说：苏联政府再一次提出警告说，巴黎协定的批准将使欧洲的局势大大复杂化，并将使欧洲问题，首先是德国问题，不可能解决。一切欧洲国家的政府都应该认识到它们在这个创造历史的时刻的责任。
    自由民主党的“晨报”说：苏联关于召开全欧会议的建议符合于每一个德国爱国者的切身利益。
    “论坛报”、“国民日报”、“柏林日报”、
  “青年世界报”和“农民回声报”等，也在社论中热烈地欢迎苏联政府的照会。
    据新华社讯：柏林消息：西德各报用大量篇幅刊载了苏联政府建议召开全欧会议的照会，并且发表了评论。
    一些报纸认为不能拒绝苏联的建议。汉堡的“世界报”说：“很明显，苏联关于谈判的建议是不能直截了当地拒绝的。”“法兰克福评论”说：苏联的建议需要加以最认真的考虑。苏联政府表明它要在批准巴黎协定以前举行欧洲国家会议。德国人不应该放过就恢复德国统一问题迅速举行谈判的机会，没有一个德国人有权同意拒绝这种谈判。
    社会民主党的“汉堡回声”报说：莫斯科最近的外交步骤已经在小国中引起了“谨慎的乐观情绪”。该报指出：如果巴黎协定付诸实施，德国的分裂就将成为定局，而东方集团就会采取新的措施来维护它们的安全。这样的一种局势会带来什么后果是不言而喻的。
  　甚至在海得尔堡出版的波恩政府联盟的报纸“莱因—尼喀报”都认为：必须同莫斯科举行谈判，首先是求得一个可以接受的解决德国问题的办法，从而缓和欧洲紧张局势。
    其他一些报纸认为苏联的照会值得注意。西德有势力的资产阶级报纸“法兰克福寰球报”说：苏联这个照会是苏联政策中一个新步骤。
    反对苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议的许多西德报纸也指出：必须经过严重的辩论才能拒绝苏联照会。
