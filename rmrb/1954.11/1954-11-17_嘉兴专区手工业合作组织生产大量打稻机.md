    Jiaxing Special District Handicraft Cooperative Organizations Produce Large Numbers of Rice Threshers
    Twenty handicraft production cooperatives in Jiaxing Special District, Zhejiang Province, including the Weitang Ironware Cooperative in Jiashan County and the Tanghui Carpentry Cooperative in Jiaxing County, have manufactured 1,700 inexpensive and practical simple rice threshers, which were supplied to farmers during the autumn harvest.
    Jiaxing Special District is a high-yield rice area in Zhejiang Province. This year, in order to increase the rice yield per unit area, farmers in the entire district converted more than 700,000 mu of early and mid-season rice fields to late-season rice. The time for threshing became concentrated, and farmers urgently needed a supply of rice threshers. Farmers in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Jiashan counties alone needed 1,900 threshers. However, the total number of new-style rice threshers produced by iron factories throughout the province was only 1,200. In order to meet the urgent needs of the farmers, the Jiaxing Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized handicraftsmen to produce this simple rice thresher. Due to the simple handicraft equipment, it was not easy to manufacture rice threshers. Later, Lin Guilong, a member of the Weitang Township Ironware Cooperative in Jiashan, improved and newly manufactured six kinds of production tools, which increased work efficiency by three to six and a half times. The rice threshers made with these new tools were of better quality. In early June, representatives of ironware production cooperatives from the entire district visited Weitang Township to observe and then began to imitate the process. As a result, 1,700 simple rice threshers were manufactured before the late rice harvest. (Xinhua News Agency)

    嘉兴专区手工业合作组织生产大量打稻机
    浙江省嘉兴专区嘉善县魏塘铁器社、嘉兴县塘汇木工社等二十个手工业生产合作组织已制造了一千七百台价廉物美的简式打稻机，在秋收时供给农民。
    嘉兴专区是浙江省水稻高产量地区。今年全区农民为了提高水稻单位面积产量，把原来的七十多万亩早、中稻田改植了晚稻，打稻时间趋于集中，农民们都迫切要求供应打稻机，仅嘉兴、平湖、嘉善三县的农民就需要一千九百台。但全省铁工厂生产的新式打稻机总数不过一千二百台。为了满足农民的迫切需要，嘉兴专区供销合作社即组织手工业者生产这种简式打稻机，由于手工业设备简陋，制造打稻机很不容易，后来嘉善魏塘镇铁器社社员林桂龙改进和新制造了六种生产工具，使工作效率提高三倍到六倍半，用这种新工具制出的打稻机质量较好。六月上旬，全区铁器生产合作组织的代表往魏塘镇参观后，开始仿造，结果在晚稻收获前制成简式打稻机一千七百台。　（新华社）
