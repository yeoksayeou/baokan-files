Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 9th: Xiang People's Congresses were universally convened in various parts of Hunan Province in late October to summarize the benefits of the state's implementation of unified grain purchase and sale. After summarizing, the peasants in the disaster-stricken areas of Dongting Lake were very satisfied with the state's implementation of unified grain purchase and sale. After Wenjia Township in Lixian County suffered a flood this year, the state supplied 360,000 catties of rice to this township at a reasonable price, which made the peasants in the whole township feel at ease to produce at home. Liu Ditang, an elderly peasant in Wenlong Township, Hanshou County, said at the Township People's Congress: "I have experienced several years of major floods and famines, and I have never seen a situation like this year. I remember in 1931 when there was a flood, the price of rice rose three times a day. At that time, my family had no money to buy rice, and six people went out to flee the famine, and three of them died. This year, after the embankment collapsed, the government used large boats to transport rice to our door. My family of ten bought four months' worth of food at once. If the state had not implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, how could the disaster victims be so at ease to produce at home today?"

Many peasants calculated at the meeting the benefits of being free from the exploitation of private merchants after the state implemented unified grain purchase and sale. The peasants in the 12th district of Yiyang County calculated an account at the representative meeting: Last year, the district purchased 4.3 million catties of grain in a unified way, and the price per hundred catties was 20,000 yuan higher than the purchase price of private merchants when new grain was launched in previous years. A total of 860 million yuan was earned more, and the 3,640 grain-selling households in the district earned an average of more than 230,000 yuan per household. A total of 2,088,500 catties of rice were sold in a unified way in the district, and the price per hundred catties was on average 40,000 yuan lower than the selling price of private merchants in the spring of 1952. A total of more than 835 million yuan was exempted from the exploitation of private merchants for the 4,500 unified sales households in the district. Luo Baijun, a peasant in Gonghe Township, Guiyang County, said at the Xiang People's Congress: "I have some surplus grain every year, but in the past, as soon as the autumn harvest came, private merchants would lower the price to purchase it. The money I earned was only enough for pocket money, and there was no way to expand production. Last year, I sold more than 1,000 catties of rice to the state. In addition to buying new clothes for my wife and children, I also bought ammonium sulfate, manure, and farm tools. I invested enough in production, and I harvested more than 1,000 catties of rice this year." Peasants in Zhengfu Township, Xiangtan County, sold surplus grain to the state last year and earned a total of more than 300 million yuan. The peasants in the township bought back more than 300,000 catties of fertilizer, eight head of cattle, and twelve waterwheels, and expanded more than 90 mu of double-cropping rice this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 10th: Peasants in Sichuan Province who have benefited from unified grain purchase and sale are determined to sell more surplus grain to the state this year. In many areas such as Yibin, Neijiang, and Jiangjin prefectures, where unified grain purchase and sale were carried out last year, the surplus grain sold by peasants has increased by about double compared with the same period last year. Before the unified grain purchase last year, Gao Zhengying Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Group in Songfeng Township, Yibin County, had only five household members. After the unified purchase, 15 peasant households saw the goodness of the new path and joined the mutual aid group. During this year, the state also supplied 500 catties of rice to help the members of the group who had difficulties. Therefore, the whole group was particularly motivated to produce, and this year's autumn grain increased by more than 20% compared with last year. In addition to selling the increased 68 shi of yellow grain to the state, the whole group also saved 12,000 catties of grain to sell to the state. During the spring plowing and summer production this year, 45 peasant households in Huaiyuan Township, Gaoxian County, could not plant seedlings, and 19 households lacked grain. Later, the People's Government supplied more than 9,200 catties of grain to Huaiyuan Township, which enabled the peasants in the whole township to produce at ease, and this year they have achieved a bumper harvest. Peasant Zhang Guangming said: "Because the state controls grain, our mountain peasants are no longer exploited by unscrupulous merchants." The peasants in the whole township said that they must sell more surplus grain this year.

Many peasants who had been exploited by private grain merchants in the past felt more deeply the benefits of unified grain purchase and sale. Before the unified grain purchase in Jiyi Township, Junlian County, every time new grain was on the market, private grain merchants would lower the price to buy it; when there was a shortage of grain, they would take the opportunity to raise the price and sell it at a price that was often half as high as the market price. After the implementation of unified purchase and sale last year, private grain merchants had no room for speculation. Because Li Xiaozhen sold grain to the state, he was exempted from the exploitation of private merchants, increased his income, and expanded his production investment this year compared with previous years, and his harvest increased by 10% compared with last year. She said: "If it weren't for unified purchase and sale, where would I get these benefits?" She decided to sell 1,400 catties of surplus grain to the state. Before the unified purchase last year, the 120 poor peasant households in Xinhua Village, Fanshen Township, Nanxi County, were exploited by grain merchants every year. After the implementation of unified grain purchase and sale last year, the state purchased and supplied grain at reasonable prices. Peasant Song Zi'an said: "The situation of cheap autumn and expensive spring, and the rising price of wheat and rice no longer exists, and prices are stable. These are all the benefits of unified grain purchase." Last year, only 43 households in Xinhua Village sold grain to the state, and this year it has increased to more than 100 households. Last year, Mu Zhian, a peasant in Gongli Township, Changning County, sold grain to the state and bought plows, harrows, and fertilizers. His family added new clothes, and he also deposited 300,000 yuan in the bank. This year, he took out some of his savings from the bank and invested it in production, and he achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. He believes that the government's implementation of unified grain purchase and sale is equivalent to increasing the income of peasants and turning dead grain into liquid money. He decided to sell 500 catties more surplus grain this year than last year.

    湖南各地普遍召开乡人民代表会议
    总结粮食统购统销的好处
    四川农民感到统购统销好处决心多卖余粮
    【新华社长沙九日电】湖南省各地在十月下旬普遍召开乡人民代表会议，总结国家实行粮食统购统销的好处。洞庭湖滨水灾地区的农民经过总结，对国家实行粮食统购统销很满意。澧县温家乡今年遭受水灾后，国家供应这个乡三十六万斤大米，而且价格合理，使全乡农民都安心在家生产。汉寿县文龙乡老年农民刘棣堂在乡人民代表会上说：“我经过了几次大水荒年，从没看到像今年这样的情形。记得一九三一年闹水灾时，米价一天涨三次，那时我家因为没钱买米，六口人出外逃荒，结果死了三口。今年垸子溃了以后。政府用大船运米送上门，我家十口人一次就买到了四个月口粮。要不是国家实行了粮食统购统销，今天灾民那能这样安心在家生产。”
    许多农民在会上计算了国家实行粮食统购统销后免受私商中间剥削的好处，益阳县十二区的农民在代表会议上算了一笔账：去年全区统购粮食四百三十万斤，每百斤价格比往年新谷登场时私商的收购价格要高二万元，共多得款八亿六千万元，全区三千六百四十个卖粮户，每户平均多得二十三万多元。全区统销大米二百零八万八千五百斤，每百斤价格比一九五二年春季私商的出卖价格平均低四万元，全区四千五百个统销户，共计免受私商剥削八亿三千五百多万元。桂阳县共和乡农民罗百钧在乡人民代表会上说：“我每年要余一些粮食，但过去一到秋收，私商就压价收购，卖得的钱只够零花，谈不到扩大生产。去年我卖了一千多斤稻谷给国家，除了给老婆、孩子添了新衣外，还买了硫酸錏、大粪和农具，生产本钱下得足，今年又多收了一千多斤谷子。”湘潭县正福乡农民去年卖余粮给国家，共得款三亿多元，全乡农民买回三十多万斤肥料、八头耕牛和十二部水车，今年扩大了双季稻九十多亩。
   【新华社成都十日电】四川省在统购统销中得到好处的农民，今年决心把更多的余粮卖给国家。宜宾、内江、江津等专区许多去年进行了粮食统购统销的地区，农民卖出的余粮已比去年同时期增加一倍左右。宜宾县松峰乡高正英农业生产互助组在去年粮食统购前只有五户组员，统购后，有十五户农民看到新道路好，加入了互助组。这一年内，国家又供应了五百斤大米，扶助有困难的组员。因此全组生产特别有劲，今年的秋粮比去年增产二成多。全组除把增产的六十八石多黄谷卖给国家外，还节约了一万二千斤粮食卖给国家。今年春耕和夏季生产时，高县怀远乡有四十五户农民栽不上秧，有十九户缺粮，后来人民政府供应怀远乡九千二百多斤粮食，使全乡农民都安心生产，今年获得了丰收。农民张光明说：“由于国家掌握粮食，我们山区农民再不受奸商剥削了。”全乡农民表示今年一定要多卖余粮。
    许多过去遭受粮食私商剥削的农民，更深切感受到粮食统购统销的好处。筠连县集义乡在粮食统购前，每到新粮上市，粮食私商就压价收买；到青黄不接的时候，又乘机抬价，往往用高出市场一半的价格卖出。去年实行统购统销后，粮食私商没有进行投机活动的余地了。农民李孝珍由于把粮食卖给国家，免除私商中间剥削，增加了收入，今年生产投资比往年扩大，收成比去年增产一成。她说：
  “要不是统购统销，从那里得到这些好处。”她决定卖给国家一千四百斤余粮。南溪县翻身乡新华村在去年统购前，全村一百二十户家底薄的农民，年年受粮食商人的剥削，去年实行粮食统购统销后，国家用合理价格收购和供应粮食，农民宋子安说：
  “以往秋贱春贵、麦黄米价起的情景现在完全没有了，而且物价稳定，这都是粮食统购带来的好处。”去年新华村只有四十三户卖粮给国家，今年增加到
  一百多户。长宁县公理乡农民牟治安，去年把粮食卖给国家，买了犁头、耙子和肥料，全家添了新衣服，另外还存了三十万元到银行，今年春耕时，他又从银行取出一部分存款投入生产，今年获得了空前丰收。他认为：政府实行粮食统购统销，等于给农民增加了收入，把死粮变成了活钱。他决定今年要比去年多卖五百斤余粮。
