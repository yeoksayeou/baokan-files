　　Several Questions Regarding the Implementation of Compulsory Military Service

Recently, some readers have inquired: Why is compulsory military service being implemented? What are the benefits of implementing compulsory military service? Where do those who wish to volunteer for service go to complete the procedures? Brief answers are as follows:

    I

    Compulsory military service is an advanced military service system and an important measure for building a modern national defense force. During the domestic revolutionary war period, due to the tense war environment and the fact that we did not have a unified national government, we adopted a voluntary military service system, with patriotic youth joining the Chinese People's Liberation Army on a conscious and voluntary basis. The correct implementation of this system guaranteed the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. However, the voluntary military service system only allows a small number of people who volunteer to serve, while the vast majority of people cannot fulfill their military service obligations. If this system is adopted for a long time, the marriage problems of soldiers cannot be resolved in a timely manner, the necessary standing military personnel of the country cannot be reduced, and many specific problems brought about by recruitment and demobilization will be difficult to resolve satisfactorily. In order to meet the needs of modern military construction and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, the voluntary military service system can no longer continue and must be replaced by the new compulsory military service system.

    In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our people's democratic dictatorship has become more and more consolidated, the various ethnic groups in the country have become more united, and various social reforms and economic construction have achieved tremendous success. The patriotic and internationalist political consciousness of the broad masses has been greatly enhanced, the Chinese People's Liberation Army enjoys high prestige among the people, and the militia system in various places has also been established to a certain extent. These are all favorable conditions for our country to implement compulsory military service.

    II

    Compulsory military service has the following advantages: First, from the perspective of consolidating national defense, the implementation of compulsory military service can accumulate a strong reserve of trained soldiers. Once a war breaks out, millions of trained soldiers can be immediately mobilized to the battlefield; second, from the perspective of the thinking of the broad masses and soldiers, the implementation of compulsory military service, with a fixed term of service, can relieve the ideological burden of being a "soldier for life," and the marriage problems and lifelong career problems of soldiers will be resolved in a timely manner; third, from the perspective of military construction, the implementation of compulsory military service can make many systems of the army more reasonable, and a regular military training system can be quickly realized; fourth, from the perspective of national economic expenditure, the implementation of compulsory military service can reduce the number of standing military personnel, save funds, and invest in economic construction; fifth, from the perspective of mass education, the implementation of compulsory military service can enable the vast number of young people of the right age to enjoy the right to learn military skills, improve their political awareness, and strengthen their physical fitness. In the past, many young people who volunteered to join the army, after being tempered and educated in military life, have significantly improved in terms of military knowledge, political awareness, cultural level, and health status. Many people have not only demonstrated the spirit of people's heroism in the struggle against the enemy, but also become backbones and experts in production and construction after demobilization and transfer. Therefore, the implementation of compulsory military service is entirely in line with the interests of the country and the interests of the people.

    III

    Since the former Government Administration Council passed the order on conscripting and replenishing soldiers, many people have written letters expressing their enthusiastic response to the government's call, requesting to enlist, and inquiring about regulations and procedures, fully demonstrating their high degree of enthusiasm for loving the motherland. The specific tasks for this year's conscription and replenishment of soldiers have been assigned by the former Government Administration Council to various provinces, and the provinces will allocate them to various counties and cities according to local conditions. Therefore, matters related to enlistment and registration need to be discussed with local state organs. Anyone who wishes to enlist for service can directly contact the local state administrative organs. If the local state administrative organs have not received the central government's assigned task of conscripting soldiers, then they can wait for the next conscription of soldiers before enlisting.

    Our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the development of work in various places is uneven. The implementation of compulsory military service is a new task that affects every family and every individual, and there is no set of work experience yet. We must adopt a gradual approach based on regional conditions. Therefore, it will still take time to completely replace all active-duty troops. It is wrong for active-duty soldiers to have the idea of waiting for demobilization and a "major reshuffle" because of the implementation of compulsory military service. In addition, it is also wrong for those who enthusiastically request to enlist to feel uneasy about their current jobs, studies, and production if they do not get the opportunity to enlist, which affects their mood.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It is composed of outstanding sons and daughters of the people. It stands closely with the people and serves them wholeheartedly. It is an army that is closely connected to the people and a strong fortress for safeguarding the country's socialist construction. Without the people's army, there would be nothing for the people. Therefore, strengthening the construction of the people's army and fulfilling the obligation of citizens to perform military service is a concrete manifestation of patriotism and socialist political awareness. Citizens who are of the prescribed conscription age: Be prepared at all times to respond to the call of the motherland.

### 关于实行义务兵役制的几个问题

专栏：答读者问

　　关于实行义务兵役制的几个问题
    近来有些读者询问：为什么要实行义务兵役制？实行义务兵役制究竟有哪些好处？志愿服役的人到哪里办理手续？现简复如下：
    一
    义务兵役制是一种先进的兵役制度，是建设现代化国防力量的重要措施。在国内革命战争时期，由于紧张的战争环境，又由于我们没有统一的全国政权，所以我们过去采取了志愿兵役制度，在爱国青年自觉自愿的基础上加入中国人民解放军。这一制度的正确实施，保证了中国人民革命的胜利。但是，志愿兵役制只有少数志愿参军的人服役，而绝大多数人不能尽服兵役的义务，如果长期采用这个制度，战士的婚姻问题不能得到及时解决，国家必需的常备兵员不能减少，还有因募集、复员等带来的许多具体问题也很难得到圆满的解决。为了适应现代化的军事建设的需要，保卫社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，志愿兵役制度已经不能继续下去了，必须以新的义务兵役制来代替。
    中华人民共和国成立五年来，我们的人民民主专政一天比一天巩固了，国内各民族已经更加团结了，各种社会改革和经济建设获得了巨大的成就，广大群众爱国主义和国际主义的政治觉悟已大大提高，中国人民解放军在人民群众中有着高度的威望，各地民兵制度也有了一定的基础，这些都是我国实行义务兵役制的良好条件。
    二
    义务兵役制有以下几点好处：第一、从巩固国防来说，实行义务兵役制可以积蓄强大的经过训练的预备兵员，一旦发生战争，可以立即动员千百万经过训练的兵员投入战场；第二、从广大群众和战士思想来说，实行义务兵役制，有了服役期限，可以解除“辈子兵”的思想负担，战士的婚姻问题和终身职业问题等都会得到及时的解决；第三、从军事建设上来说，实行义务兵役制，可以使军队的许多制度更加合理，正规军事训练制度，可以迅速实现；第四、从国家经济开支上来说，实行义务兵役制，可以减少常备兵员的数量，节省经费，投入经济建设；第五、从群众教育上来说，实行义务兵役制，可以使广大适龄青年享受学习军事技术、提高政治觉悟、锻炼体格增强体质的权利。过去，许多志愿参军的青年，经过了军事生活的锻炼和教养，无论在军事知识、政治觉悟、文化水平、健康状况等方面都有显著的提高，许多人不仅在对敌斗争中表现了人民英雄主义的气概，即使复员转业以后也都是生产建设的骨干和能手，所以，实行义务兵役制是完全符合于国家利益和全国人民的利益的。
    三
    自从前政务院通过了关于征集补充兵员的命令以后，许多人纷纷来信表示热烈响应政府号召，要求应征入伍，并查询条例和手续，充分地表现了爱护祖国的高度热情。关于今年征集补充兵员的具体任务，已由前政务院分配到各省，各省将根据当地具体情况，分配到各县、市，因此，有关应征报到事宜，需与当地地方国家机关接洽。凡是要求应征服役的人，可直接和当地地方国家行政机关接洽，如果当地地方国家行政机关没有领受到中央分配的征集兵员的任务，那么，可以等待下次征集兵员时再行应征。
    我国地区辽阔，人口众多，各地工作发展也不平衡，实行义务兵役制又是关系到每个家庭和每一个人的一件新的工作，还没有一套工作经验，必须根据地区条件，采取逐步推行的方针。因此，要想把现役部队全部轮换完毕，还是需要时间的。如果现役军人因为实行义务兵役制有着等待复员和“大换班”的思想，这是不对的；另外，热忱要求应征的人如果得不到应征机会就不安心于本岗位的工作、学习和生产，而影响情绪也是不对的。
    中国人民解放军是在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的军队，它是人民的优秀儿女组成的，它紧紧地和人民站在一起，全心全意地为人民服务，它是和人民骨肉相连的军队，是保卫国家的社会主义建设事业的坚强堡垒，没有人民的军队，就没有人民的一切，所以加强人民军队的建设，履行公民服兵役的义务，就是爱国主义、社会主义政治觉悟的具体表现。适合规定的征集年龄的公民们：时刻准备着，响应祖国的号召。
