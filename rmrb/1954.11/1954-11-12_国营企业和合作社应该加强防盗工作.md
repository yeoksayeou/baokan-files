    State-owned Enterprises and Cooperatives Should Strengthen Anti-Theft Work

    In the past year or so, theft cases have increased in some areas. In the first half of this year, theft cases in thirteen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Shenyang, Anshan, and Benxi accounted for 83 percent of all criminal cases. The loss of public and private property amounted to more than 15.4 billion yuan, accounting for over 70 percent of the total losses caused by criminal offenses. Among theft cases, a significant proportion involved state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, schools, and government agencies, and the frequency of cases and the loss of property are constantly increasing. This situation is very noteworthy.

    Among the criminals engaged in theft, some are counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries, but more are habitual thieves, rogues, hooligans, and remnants of the former Kuomintang army and government who have not yet been reformed. There are also a few employees, young students, and degenerate workers who have been influenced and lured by the above-mentioned elements. Some of these counter-revolutionaries, reactionaries, habitual thieves, and other bad elements have taken the opportunity to infiltrate our state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and government agencies, wearing employee and worker uniforms, corrupting and enticing our backward workers and employees, especially colluding with social hooligans to steal public property on a large scale from both inside and outside. Particularly serious is that some thieves even murder people in cold blood after their crimes are discovered. The two thieves and murderers recently executed in Beijing and Fushun are two prominent examples. These facts show that if we relax our vigilance against theft, it will not only cause significant losses to public property, but sometimes also endanger the lives of the people.

    However, many staff in state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and government agencies are very careless. They lack the concept of cherishing and protecting public property, believing that "it doesn't matter if we sleep with the door open." Therefore, many enterprises, cooperatives, and government agencies do not pay attention to screening when recruiting personnel, rarely conduct education on preventing spies and anti-theft among their staff, and some even lack necessary duty systems and regulations for the requisition and safekeeping of goods, and the door locking equipment is not complete. This allows thieves to take advantage of loopholes and steal public property at will. The carelessness of the staff of the Fushun City Mining Bureau Timber Factory Employees Consumer Cooperative is by no means an isolated case in state-owned enterprises and cooperatives.

    To effectively prevent theft in the future, in addition to the public security and judicial organs in various places continuing to strengthen the crackdown and punishment of thieves and saboteurs and correct the past tendency of insufficient crackdown and punishment in some areas, it is also necessary to conduct in-depth education for the staff of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and government agencies to establish the concept of cherishing and protecting public property, making them realize that various state-owned enterprises and cooperatives must concentrate their efforts on improving production and management to expand the strength of the socialist economy, and at the same time take effective measures to protect the safety of public property. If we only pay attention to production every day, but do not pay attention to defending production, and do not pay attention to preventing spies and theft, what guarantee will there be for the fruits of everyone's hard work and production if a large amount of state property and cooperative property is stolen or destroyed? How can our socialist construction and socialist transformation be successfully completed? This means that we must not only be good at leading the people in production and construction, but also constantly educate and mobilize the masses to protect our labor achievements. Therefore, all state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, schools, and government agencies should regard cherishing and protecting public property as an important task, and quickly establish and improve working systems for preventing spies, theft, and fire prevention, especially the personnel security work system and the requisition and safekeeping of goods work system. If theft occurs in the future, on the one hand, we must actively investigate and arrest criminals and severely punish them according to law, and on the other hand, we must also earnestly investigate the responsibilities and give necessary disciplinary sanctions to those bureaucratic officials who are indifferent to state property. In the past, many enterprises and cooperatives did not actively investigate or seriously deal with theft cases after they occurred. On the one hand, this made those staff members with a weak sense of responsibility feel that "stealing public property has nothing to do with me," and therefore did not pay attention to strengthening anti-theft work; on the other hand, it made those thieves feel that public property is easy to steal, and no one will investigate after stealing, thus fueling the arrogance of the thieves. This is an extremely bad bureaucratic attitude towards public property and must be resolutely corrected.

### 国营企业和合作社应该加强防盗工作

    国营企业和合作社应该加强防盗工作
    最近一年多来，有些地方盗窃案件较前增加。北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、沈阳、鞍山、本溪等十三个城市今年上半年发生的盗窃案件占各种刑事案件的百分之八十三，公私财物的损失达一百五十四亿多元，占刑事犯罪所造成的损失总数的百分之七十以上。在盗窃案件中，国营企业部门、合作社、学校和机关失盗的案件占了很大的比例，而且案件发生的次数和财物的损失都是不断地增加。这种情况是十分值得注意的。
    在从事盗窃活动的犯罪分子中，有一些是反革命分子和反动分子，更多的是旧社会遗留下来的惯盗、惯窃、地痞、流氓以及尚未得到改造的伪军政人员，也有少数是受上述分子的影响、诱骗而腐化堕落的职工、青年学生和蜕化变质的工作人员。这些反革命分子、反动分子和惯盗、惯窃等坏分子中，有的已经乘机混进了我们的国营企业部门、合作社和机关，穿上职员和工人制服，腐蚀利诱我们的落后的工作人员和落后的职工，特别是勾结拉拢社会上的流氓分子，里应外合地大肆盗窃公共财产。特别严重的是有些盗窃分子在他们的犯罪行为被发觉以后，竟至凶恶地杀害人命。最近北京和抚顺所处决的两个盗窃杀人犯，就是两个突出的例子。这些事实说明，如果我们放松了对于盗窃活动应有的警惕，不仅会造成公共财产的重大损失，有时还会危及人民群众的生命安全。
    但是在国营企业部门、合作社和机关中，有不少工作人员是很麻痹大意的，他们缺乏爱护和保卫公共财产的观念，认为“敞着门睡觉也没有关系”。因此有不少企业部门、合作社和机关在招收人员时不注意审查，平日很少在所属人员中进行防奸反特和防盗的教育，有的甚至连必要的值班制度、物品的领取和保管制度也没有，锁门的用具也不齐全。这就使得盗窃分子有隙可乘，可以随意窃取公共财物。像抚顺市矿务局木材厂职工消费合作社工作人员那样麻痹大意的事情，在国营企业部门和合作社中决不是个别的。
    要在今后有效地防止盗窃活动，除各地公安、司法机关仍须继续加强对盗窃破坏分子的打击惩办，纠正某些地区过去打击不力惩办不力的偏向外，还必须对国营企业部门、合作社和机关工作人员进行深入教育，树立爱护和保卫公共财产的观念，使他们认识，各种国营企业和合作社必须在集中精力改善生产和经营管理工作，以扩大社会主义经济力量的同时，采取有效措施来保护公共财产的安全。如果我们每天只注意生产，不注意保卫生产，不注意防特、防盗，结果把大批国家财产和合作社财产被人偷走了，被人破坏了，试问大家辛辛苦苦劳动生产的成果还有什么保障呢？我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造又怎么能够顺利完成呢？这就是说，我们不仅要善于领导人民群众进行生产建设，而且还要经常教育和动员群众保卫我们的劳动成果。因此一切国营企业部门、合作社和学校、机关都应该把爱护和保卫公共财产当作重要的工作，迅速建立和健全防特、防盗和防火等工作制度，特别是要首先建立和健全人事保卫工作制度和物品的领取和保管工作制度。如果在今后发生了盗窃事件，一方面要积极追查和捉拿犯罪分子，务须依法严惩，同时也要认真地查清责任，给予那些对国家财产漠不关心的官僚主义者以必要的纪律制裁。过去有不少企业部门和合作社在发生失盗事件以后，既不积极追查，也不严肃处理，这一方面使那些责任心不强的工作人员觉得“偷了公家的东西，反正同自己没有关系”，因而不注意加强防盗工作；另一方面，使那些盗窃分子觉得公家的东西好偷，偷了以后也没有人追查，因而助长了盗窃分子的气焰。这是一种对待公共财产的极其恶劣的官僚主义态度，必须坚决纠正。
