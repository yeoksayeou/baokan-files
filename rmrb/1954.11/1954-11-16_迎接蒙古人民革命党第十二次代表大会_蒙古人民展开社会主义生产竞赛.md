Xinhua News Agency, Fifteenth of November, Ulaanbaatar News: To welcome the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to be held on the 18th of this month, the people of Mongolia are enthusiastically launching a socialist production competition and have already achieved remarkable results.

The entire staff of the Stalin Railway Bureau, who initiated this competition, has completed the year's passenger and freight transport plan two months ahead of schedule. The Stalin-named Meat Combine Factory in Ulaanbaatar has completed two years of production tasks in ten months. Akalang and Jiatehu, advanced workers in the factory's affiliated soap-making department, have also manufactured a new soap-cutting machine, which has increased labor productivity by 60 percent and increased the country's revenue by 60,000 Tugriks (Mongolian currency). An advanced team at the No. 10 mine of the Nalaikha Coal Mine completed the year's coal mining plan as early as July 28th. Since the launch of this production competition movement, the team has over-fulfilled the plan by mining more than 2,000 tons of coal. They also expressed their intention to complete the coal mining plan for the first quarter of 1955 in December of this year. A food combine factory in Bayan-Ulgii Province has over-fulfilled the annual production plan by 7.2 percent. The factory's cream production increased by 6.2 percent, while the milk used for oil production was saved by more than 93,000 liters, contributing more than 50,000 Tugriks in profits to the state.

Workers at various state-run ranches have also launched production competitions to welcome the 12th Party Congress. Garsonjamin, a advanced worker and combine harvester at the Inggetolgai State Farm, and Lubusang Bolin have over-fulfilled the harvesting plan by 150 percent. Tractor drivers such as Niyingdaerji and Jiashalang at the Hongduerhan State Farm have cultivated more than 180 hectares of wasteland, over-fulfilling their production tasks.
