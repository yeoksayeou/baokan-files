    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital has implemented the "workshop doctor" system since January this year, which has played a certain role in protecting workers' health and reducing worker absenteeism due to illness. In the third quarter of this year, the number of worker illnesses at the plant decreased by nearly one-third compared to the same period last year, and the number of days of absenteeism decreased by more than one-fifth compared to the same period last year.

    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant divides the workshops into four large workshops, each with an internist serving as the workshop doctor. In addition to being responsible for treating patients from their respective workshops in the hospital's outpatient department and wards, the workshop doctors also regularly go to the site to understand the workers' work environment and labor conditions, and study the causes of worker illnesses. In about half a year, the workshop doctors discovered a total of 238 problems related to worker health, and after submitting them to the workshop leaders and the plant, many problems were resolved. The workshop doctors also lead the health stations in each workshop. Workers can receive preliminary treatment for work-related injuries and general illnesses in the workshop in a timely manner from the health stations. Some minor injuries and illnesses are resolved during the preliminary treatment. This reduces the time it takes for some workers to go back and forth to the outpatient department for treatment, and at the same time alleviates the crowded conditions in the outpatient department. The workshop doctors conduct long-term and systematic observations of the work, thinking, and living habits of patients with chronic diseases, and also frequently visit patients with acute and chronic diseases in the hospital and workers' homes. The workshop doctors conduct health check-ups for workers with a focus, and often carry out a series of preventive work such as health knowledge publicity for workers.

    Since the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant implemented the workshop doctor system, the doctors have all felt that going to the workshop is the most honorable thing, which has changed the complacent mentality of "it is enough to do a good job in clinical practice" in the past. The doctors actively care about the health of the workers. Li Xuezeng, an old worker in the foundry department, used to take frequent sick leave every year due to stomach problems. In addition to patiently treating him, the workshop doctor also advised him to change his habit of not chewing food carefully and eating too quickly. The medical staff at the health station often sent medicine to the site for him to take. After systematic prevention and treatment, his stomach problems, which he had suffered from for more than six years, quickly improved. He has not taken a single day of sick leave this year due to stomach problems.

### 石景山钢铁厂医院实行车间医师制

    石景山钢铁厂医院实行车间医师制
    石景山钢铁厂医院自从今年一月实行车间医师制以来，在保护工人健康、降低工人因病缺勤方面，起了一定的作用。今年第三季度该厂工人发病人数比去年同时期降低了将近三分之一，缺勤的天数比去年同时期减少五分之一以上。
    石景山钢铁厂把各车间分成四个大车间，分别由四个内科医师担任车间医师。车间医师除了在医院门诊部和病房负责治疗自己所辖车间的病人外，每周还定期到现场去了解工人的作业环境和劳动条件，研究工人发病的原因。在约半年的时间中，车间医师共发现了二百三十八件有关工人卫生方面的问题，向车间领导上和厂方提出后，很多问题获得了解决。车间医师并领导每个车间的保健站，工人有了工伤事故和一般疾病可以及时地在车间得到保健站的初步治疗，有些轻微的伤病在初步治疗中就解决了问题。这样，就使一部分工人减少了往返门诊部看病的时间，同时减轻了门诊的拥挤情况。车间医师对慢性病患者的工作、思想情况、生活习惯等都作长期、系统的观察，还经常到医院和职工家中去访视急病和慢性病患者。车间医师有重点地给职工作健康检查，并经常对工人进行卫生常识宣传等一系列的预防工作。
    石景山钢铁厂推行车间医师制以后，医师们都认为下车间是最荣誉的事，改变了过去“做好临床就够了”的自满情绪。医师们主动地关心工人们的健康。铸造部老工人李学增过去每年都因胃病常常休工。车间医师除耐心给他治疗外，并劝告他改变了吃东西不细嚼、贪快的毛病。保健站的医务人员常常送药到现场去给他吃，经过系统地防治，使他的患了六年多的胃病很快好转了。他今年没有因胃病休过一天工。  （新华社）
