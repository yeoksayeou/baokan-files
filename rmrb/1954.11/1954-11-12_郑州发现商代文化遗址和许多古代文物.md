On the extensive basic construction sites in Zhengzhou, many ruins and tombs have been successively discovered. Among them, the Shang Dynasty cultural ruins are the most widely distributed (extending 20 li from east to west and 7 li from north to south). The ancient artifacts buried in the ruins are extremely rich, representing the most valuable historical data for studying ancient Chinese society.

On a construction site outside the South Gate of Zhengzhou, a Shang Dynasty copper smelting site was excavated. Inside, there were "large-mouthed vessels" for smelting copper, molds for casting copper arrowheads and copper spears, etc. Near the construction site of the Henan Provincial People's Government, a Shang Dynasty bone artifact manufacturing site was also discovered. Excavated items included raw materials for bone artifacts, semi-finished products, finished products, and whetstones for grinding bone artifacts. The raw materials for manufacturing bone artifacts included pig bones, deer bones, and human bones. Finished bone artifacts included bone arrowheads and bone hairpins. These extremely valuable discoveries provide important data for the study of the production conditions of Shang Dynasty society in China.

A large number of pottery shards also remain in the Shang Dynasty ruins in Zhengzhou. These pottery shards include *li* tripods, *ding* tripods, and *zun* vessels. Some unearthed oracle bones and a bone fragment engraved with characters are valuable historical materials. In Zhengzhou People's Park, complete Shang Dynasty tomb complexes have also been unearthed. In addition, there are architectural ruins and kiln ruins.

The artifacts unearthed from the upper layer of the Zhengzhou Shang Dynasty cultural ruins are similar to those unearthed from the "Yinxu" site at Xiaotun in Anyang; however, the artifacts unearthed from the middle and lower layers are not entirely the same as those unearthed from "Yinxu." This important difference proves that the Zhengzhou Shang Dynasty cultural ruins may be earlier than the "Yinxu" site at Xiaotun in Anyang. This situation awaits further research by archaeological experts. It is worth noting that the "Longshan Culture" and "Yangshao Culture" have also been discovered in Zhengzhou; and both cultural layers were discovered below the Zhengzhou Shang Dynasty cultural ruins.

Cultural institutions and academia at all levels of the People's Government attach great importance to the discovery of the Zhengzhou Shang Dynasty cultural ruins. The Social Cultural Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Nanjing Museum have all sent responsible cadres and archaeological experts to Zhengzhou to conduct on-site research on this major discovery, and to jointly study and strengthen the work of clearing cultural relics in Zhengzhou with the heads of the cultural departments of Henan Province and Zhengzhou City. The Ministry of Culture has also decided to transfer the East China Cultural Relics Work Team to support the Zhengzhou cultural relics excavation work.

    郑州发现商代文化遗址和许多古代文物
    在郑州市广大的基本建设工地上，先后发现许多遗址墓葬，其中以商代文化遗址分布最广（东西长二十华里，南北宽七华里）。遗址中所埋藏的古代文物非常丰富，是研究我国古代社会的最宝贵的历史资料。
    郑州南关外的工地上，曾发掘出一座商代的炼铜遗址。在这里面，有炼铜用的“大口器”、铸铜箭头及铜矛用的模子等。在河南省人民政府的工地附近，还发现商代制造骨器的地方。出土的有骨器原料、半成品、成品及磨制骨器用的砺石等物。制造骨器的原料，有猪骨、鹿骨、人骨。骨器制成品有骨箭头、骨簪等。这些极有价值的发现，对于我国商代社会生产状况的研究提供了重要的资料。
    郑州的商代遗址中，还遗存着大量的陶片。这些陶片，有陶鬲、鼎、尊等。一些出土的卜骨和一片刻有文字的骨片，都是很有价值的历史资料。在郑州人民公园里，还挖出完整的商代墓葬群。此外还有建筑遗址，窑的遗址。
    郑州的商代文化遗址的上层出土的文物，和安阳小屯“殷墟”出土的文物相似；但是中层和下层出土的文物和“殷墟”出土的文物并不完全相同。这个重要的区别，证明郑州商代文化遗址可能比安阳小屯“殷墟”要早。这种情况，有待考古专家们进一步的研究。值得注意的是，郑州市还曾发现“龙山文化”和“仰韶文化”；而两个文化层都是在郑州商代文化遗址的下面发现的。
    各级人民政府文化机构和学术界很重视郑州商代文化遗址的发现。文化部社会文化事业管理局、中国科学院考古研究所和南京博物院都派出负责干部和考古专家去郑州实地研究这一重大发现，并同河南省、郑州市文化部门负责人共同研究加强郑州清理文物的工作。文化部还决定调华东文物工作队去支援郑州文物发掘工作。
