The National People's Congress representatives from Chongqing's factories and mines are actively participating in the labor competitions that are vigorously underway in their respective factories. National People's Congress representative and Chongqing Special-Class Industrial Labor Model Huang Rongchang went to his woodworking shop to inquire about production on the very day he returned to Chongqing. He learned in detail about the recent production situation of the woodworking shop, discussed machine maintenance with the workers, and revised the conditions for participating in the labor competition. He proposed improving the mechanization of the planing machine to improve the quality of planing, and set the conditions for participating in the competition.

National People's Congress representative Li Bingzhong returned to the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory just as the factory was holding a workers' representative conference and a Communist Youth League members' conference to mobilize the launch of a labor competition. He immediately stated at the meeting that he would take the lead in participating. On his first day back at work, Li Bingzhong achieved excellent results in production. When planing the return pipe of the air compressor, originally one person could only plane seven or eight pieces a day. He sharpened the planer blade, straightened the tool rest, and increased the feed rate by four teeth, planing five pieces in one hour.

National People's Congress representative and Director of Qiangkun Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Boli County, Heilongjiang Province, Deng Guozhang, led the members in launching a competition to increase production and ensure harvests after returning to the village.

After Deng Guozhang returned to the village, the people warmly welcomed him and told him about the changes in the village in recent days: 162 households (out of a total of 168 households in the village) had signed up to join the agricultural production cooperative, and the entire village's land, spanning over twenty li and seven hundred hectares, was now connected into one piece. The newly built houses had increased from twelve to seventeen. Deng Guozhang's confidence in his work was further enhanced by these new changes in the village. On the third day, he conveyed the proceedings of the National People's Congress to the villagers. Deng Guozhang said to everyone during the relay: "We farmers should celebrate the success of the National People's Congress with actions of increasing production and ensuring harvests, and producing more grain to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan." After Deng Guozhang's speech, Yu Dequan, the leader of the first production team of the agricultural production cooperative, immediately challenged the other production teams, guaranteeing careful harvesting in the autumn harvest and increasing grain production by one hundred jin per hectare. More than thirty members of the second production team unanimously responded to the challenge. Subsequently, all six production teams competed to propose their own challenge conditions. Women's Director Liu Shuqing, representing all the women in the village, proposed: not to drop a single corn cob when husking corn, to ensure that both young and old go to the fields to glean crops, and that each woman would glean one hundred jin of grain to support the liberation of Taiwan. Shepherd Zhao Lu was not willing to be left behind, saying, "I will definitely collect good sheep manure, pad the sheepfold well, and drive the sheep slowly, ensuring that I shear more and better wool to sell to the country."

The competition to increase production and ensure harvests was launched enthusiastically in the Qiangkun Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. All production teams in the cooperative were determined to get the "victory flag" in their own hands. On the first day of the competition, the first production team averaged ten more bundles of rice than usual, and some people even created a new record of cutting more than one hundred and forty bundles in a day. The second production team cut cleaner than any previous day. Early snow and autumn rain had brought many difficulties to the autumn harvest, but these difficulties were overcome. The corn cobs in the fields were already covered with ice spurs, but the women were not afraid of freezing their hands and went out early in the morning to husk the corn; the male members, regardless of the water and mud in the rice fields, actively insisted on going to the fields to cut rice. The members in charge of threshing worked all day and still continued to drive the stone roller tirelessly in the evening. In two days, they threshed more than six thousand jin of grain and sold it to the country in a timely manner.

After careful calculations, the farmers of the entire cooperative proposed to increase production by another 35,000 jin of grain during the autumn harvest to celebrate the success of the National People's Congress and support the liberation of Taiwan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    黑龙江省的代表邓国章回村后带领社员开展增产保收竞赛
    回到重庆市各厂矿的全国人民代表大会代表，积极参加厂内正在热烈进行的劳动竞赛。全国人民代表大会代表、重庆市特等工业劳动模范黄荣昌在回到重庆的当天，就到他的木工房询问生产情况。他详细了解了木工房最近的生产情况，并和工人们讨论了机器检修等工作，改订参加劳动竞赛的条件。他提出了把刨木机的机械化程度提高，以提高刨木质量，并订出了参加竞赛的条件。
    全国人民代表大会代表李秉中，回到重庆空气压缩机厂时，正逢着厂内召开职工代表大会及青年团团员大会，动员开展劳动竞赛，他当即在会上表示要积极带头参加。李秉中在回厂工作的第一天，在生产上便有了优异的成绩。在刨空气压缩机的部件回气管时，原来一人每天只能刨七、八个，他磨了刨刀，把刀架端正，走刀加快四个牙，一点钟就刨了五个。

    全国人民代表大会代表、黑龙江省勃利县抢垦村农业生产合作社主任邓国章回村后，带领社员展开增产保收的竞赛。
    邓国章回到村里后，人们都热烈地欢迎他，告诉他这些天来村里的变化情形：全村已有一百六十二户（全村共一百六十八户）农民报名参加了农业生产合作社，全村方圆二十多里七百多垧的土地现在全都连成一片了。新盖起的房子已经从十二所增加到十七所。邓国章听到村里这些新的变化，更加提高了工作信心。第三天，他向全村农民传达了全国人民代表大会开会的经过情形。邓国章在传达时向大家说：“我们农民应该用增产保收、多打粮食的行动庆祝全国人民代表大会会议的成功，生产更多的粮食，支援解放台湾的斗争。”邓国章传达后，农业生产合作社第一生产队队长于德全立即提出以保证在秋收中细割细打，每垧地增产一百斤粮食的条件向各生产队挑战。第二生产队三十多个社员一齐表示应战。接着，六个生产队也都争先提出了自己的应战条件。妇女主任刘淑清代表全村妇女提出：扒苞米时不丢掉一个穗，保证老少都下地拣庄稼，每个妇女要拣一百斤粮食支援解放台湾。放羊的社员赵禄也不甘落在人后，他说：“我一定要起好羊粪，垫好羊圈，放羊赶的慢，保证剪更多更好的羊毛，卖给国家。”
    增产保收的竞赛在抢垦村农业生产合作社火热地开展起来了，全社各生产队都决心把“得胜旗”拿到自己手里。竞赛的头一天，第一生产队平均每个人都比往日多割十捆稻子，有些人还创造了一天割一百四十多捆的新纪录。第二生产队比以往任何一天都割得干净。早雪和秋雨曾给秋收带来许多困难，可是这些困难都被克服了。田地里的苞米棒已经含满冰槎，妇女们都不怕冻手，大清早就出去扒；男社员们不顾稻田里水多泥泞，都踊跃坚持着下地割稻子。负责打场的社员，白天干了一天活，晚间仍然在不停地赶磙子，在两天里他们就打出了六千多斤粮食及时地卖给了国家。
    全社的农民经过精打细算之后，提出了在秋收当中再增产三万五千斤粮食，以庆贺全国人民代表大会会议的成功和支援解放台湾。　（新华社）
