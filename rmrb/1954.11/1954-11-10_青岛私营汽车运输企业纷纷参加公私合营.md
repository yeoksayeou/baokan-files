Qingdao's private automobile transportation industry is relatively developed. According to statistics from June of this year, there are 420 households in the city, with a total of 535 passenger and freight vehicles. After liberation, the local transportation management authorities and state-owned transportation enterprises led the industry to organize six joint operation offices, implementing unified sources of goods, unified freight rates, and unified vehicle dispatch in business, reducing the blindness and chaos in the industry's operations. However, due to the existence of many contradictions in this industry, coupled with the fact that they are all operating in a decentralized manner, the enterprise expenses and family expenses are mixed together, and there are many unreasonable phenomena in the operation, which affects the accumulation of funds and the full发挥 of transportation effectiveness. After the "Five-Anti" movement and the education on the general task of the state's transition period, the car owners have a relatively clear understanding of the policy of socialist transformation. Most of the car owners in the joint operation offices expressed their hope to implement joint public-private ownership.

According to the requirements of the car owners and the needs of the country's economic construction, the Qingdao Transportation Management Bureau decided to first implement joint public-private ownership of a batch of private freight vehicles. In June of this year, it transferred a group of cadres and cooperated with the trade union and private representatives to form the Qingdao Private Automobile Transportation Industry Joint Public-Private Ownership Preparatory Committee. After several months of work, preparations have been completed in terms of the organizational structure of the enterprise, the allocation of public and private personnel, the inventory of assets and valuation, as well as the business location, employee accommodation facilities, etc., and with the approval of the higher authorities, joint public-private ownership was formally implemented on September 1. A total of 114 car owners participated in the joint public-private ownership, investing 203 vehicles and 500 million yuan in cash; the state invested 12 vehicles and 740 million yuan in cash. From the invested vehicles, 60 were transferred to Weifang City to establish the Weifang Joint Public-Private Automobile Transportation Company; 35 were transferred to Yantai to expand the Zhifu Joint Public-Private Automobile Transportation Company; and the remaining 120 vehicles formed the Qingdao Joint Public-Private Transportation Company.

After these automobiles participated in the joint public-private ownership, the transportation forces were all incorporated into the national plan; management and operation have been improved; the vehicles have been repaired in a timely manner, and the appearance has been renewed. The workers' enthusiasm for production has been increased, and they have actively strengthened the maintenance and repair of vehicles, and strived to发挥 the transportation effectiveness of vehicles. In September, the average car-ton-month output of the Qingdao Joint Public-Private Transportation Company reached 1,031 ton-kilometers (most vehicles are used for short-distance transportation in the urban area), an increase of 71 percent compared with the average of 600 ton-kilometers before the joint public-private ownership. Many car owners were also moved by the workers' high production enthusiasm. Some people said: "When transporting salt at Dagang, I used to pull up to nine trips a day at most, but now I pull 17 trips a day. Joint public-private ownership is just good!"

    青岛私营汽车运输企业纷纷参加公私合营
    青岛市私营汽车运输业比较发达，据今年六月份的统计，全市有四百二十户，共有客运、货运汽车五百三十五辆。解放后，当地交通管理机关和国营运输企业，领导该业组织了六个联营处，在业务上实行统一货源、统一运价、统一车辆调度等办法，减少了该业经营中的盲目性和混乱现象。但是由于这一行业还存在着许多矛盾，加以都是分散经营的，企业开支和家庭开支混在一起，经营中存在不少不合理的现象，影响了积累资金和充分发挥运输效能。经过“五反”运动和国家过渡时期总任务的教育，车主们对社会主义改造的政策有了比较明确的认识，各联营处大部分车主表示希望实行公私合营。
    青岛市运输管理机关根据车主的要求和国家经济建设的需要，决定先将一批私营货运汽车实行公私合营，今年六月间即抽调一批干部，配合工会、私方代表组成了青岛市私营汽车运输业公私合营筹备委员会。经过几个月的工作，在企业的组织机构、公私人员的配备、清产估价，以及营业地点、职工食宿设备等方面筹备就绪，并经上级批准，在九月一日正式公私合营。参加公私合营的车主共一百一十四户，投资汽车二百零三辆、现金五亿元；国家投资汽车十二辆、现金七亿四千万元。从投资车辆中调潍坊市六十辆，成立了潍坊公私合营汽车运输公司；调烟台三十五辆，扩大了公私合营芝罘汽车运输公司；其余一百二十辆，组成了公私合营青岛运输公司。
    这些汽车参加公私合营以后，运输力量都纳入了国家计划；经营管理方面已有改进；车辆得到及时的修整，面貌为之一新。工人们生产热情提高，积极加强对车辆的保养和修理，努力发挥车辆的运输效能。九月份公私合营青岛运输公司的汽车车吨月产量，平均达到一千零三十一吨公里（大部车辆在市区短途运输），比公私合营前平均六百吨公里提高百分之七十一。不少车主也被工人们高涨的生产情绪所感动，有的人说：“在大港运食盐，从前一天最多拉九趟，现在一天拉十七趟，公私合营就是好！”  （葛清波　顾传潞）
