    The winter repair project of the lower Yellow River embankment is nearing completion. This year's winter repair project for the lower Yellow River embankment mainly includes the heightening and widening of the Dongping Lake levee, the North Jin levee, and the Qin River levee, the repair of the South Jin levee, and the reinforcement of the Dongming section's dam foundation and the front and rear retaining walls of the levee line. The project requires a total of more than 2 million cubic meters of earthwork. In addition, 200,000 cone penetration tests need to be carried out on the Puyang section of the levee line to eliminate potential hazards. The winter repair project started in mid-October, and by November 13th, construction had begun in various places, with nearly 70,000 migrant workers on the levee. By the 18th, all work in Shandong Province had been completed. The Qin River levee in Henan Province started construction later due to difficulties in obtaining earth, and is expected to be completed in December. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The Huai River Estuary Channel and Hongze Lake in northern Jiangsu Province have begun to store water.

    The main measures for water storage are: 1. Gradually reduce the discharge flow of the Sanhe Sluice; it has now been reduced from 10,000 cubic meters per second to 500 cubic meters per second, so that Hongze Lake can store water as needed. 2. Carry out damming projects in the Huai River Estuary Channel to block and store the water flowing into the Yangtze River. The purpose of storing water is to ensure that major rivers such as the Li Canal in northern Jiangsu can be navigable in winter, guarantee the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and enable the tens of millions of mu of farmland in the Lixiahe area to be irrigated next spring. Currently, the Bi Hu Dam and Fenghuang Dam in the Huai River Estuary Channel have been successfully closed, and the Xinhe Dam and Lanjiang Dam are about to be completed.

    黄河下游堤防冬修工程接近完工
    淮河入江水道和洪泽湖开始蓄水
    黄河下游堤防冬修工程已接近完成。今年黄河下游堤防的冬修工程，主要包括东平湖湖堤、北金堤、沁河堤加高帮宽，南金堤补修，东明段坝基和堤线前后戗加固等工程，共需做土方二百多万公方。另外，濮阳段堤线需再做二十万眼消灭隐患的锥探工程。冬修工程从十月中旬起，到十一月十三日止，各处先后动工，上堤民工近七万名。到十八日，山东省各处先后完工。河南省沁河堤因取土困难，动工较晚，十二月可全部完工。（新华社）
    江苏省北部淮河入江水道和洪泽湖已开始蓄水。
    蓄水的主要措施是：一、把三河闸放水流量逐渐减少，现在已从一万个秒公方减少到五百个秒公方，使洪泽湖按需要蓄水。二、在淮河入江水道方面进行堵坝工程，拦蓄入江水量。蓄水的目的，是使江苏北部里运河等主要河道冬季可以通航，保证城乡物资交流，并使明年春季里下河地区的千万亩农田可以得到灌溉。现在淮河入江水道的壁虎坝、凤凰坝已先后合龙，新河坝、拦江坝即将堵闭完工。
