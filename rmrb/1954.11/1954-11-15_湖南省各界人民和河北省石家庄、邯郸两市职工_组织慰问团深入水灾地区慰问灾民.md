    People from All Walks of Life in Hunan Province and Workers from Shijiazhuang and Handan Cities in Hebei Province
    Organize慰問 Teams to Visit Flood-stricken Areas and Comfort Disaster Victims
    In late October, people from all walks of life in Hunan Province organized慰問 teams to visit flood-stricken areas and comfort disaster victims, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the people in the disaster areas to help themselves through production.
    The Hunan Provincial慰問 Team was jointly formed by the government, the military, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, with a total of more than 200 people including staff. They were divided into groups to conduct key visits in the West Dongting Lake area, the South Dongting Lake area, and the Datong Lake area, expressing the cordial care and sincere greetings of the people from all walks of life to the disaster victims through representatives' meetings, and encouraging the disaster victims to actively engage in production and self-rescue under the leadership of the Party and the government to overcome the disaster.
    The people in the flood-stricken areas were extremely excited about the cordial慰問 from the慰問 team and were determined to repay the care of the people from all walks of life with practical actions of production and self-rescue. Farmers from Baoshi Township in Xiangyin, who won the collective model title in the flood prevention and rescue struggle in Huanghuagang, Xiangyin, prepared to send more than 400 laborers to participate in the work of repairing the breached dikes after receiving慰問. The day after the慰問 team visited Yixin Township in Yiyang County, the township's democratic agricultural production cooperative mobilized many members to start reclaiming wasteland, preparing to sow another 50 mu of rapeseed and other winter crops.

    In late October, workers from Shijiazhuang and Handan cities in Hebei Province organized慰問 teams to visit farmers affected by floods. The Shijiazhuang City Workers'慰問 Team慰問ed disaster victims in Anping and Raoyang counties through methods such as disaster relief meetings, small-scale forums, and individual visits; the Handan City Workers'慰問 Team慰問ed three townships and nine villages and twelve agricultural production cooperatives in the Cangxian Prefecture. The members of the Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Duanjundao Village, Raoyang County, were greatly encouraged after receiving慰問, and completed the 1,250-mu wheat planting plan ahead of schedule, quickly turning to sideline production. The cooperative's house-building team, which originally planned to build six houses in seven days, completed the work three days ahead of schedule. They confidently said to the workers of the慰問 team: "Please go back and tell the worker comrades to rest assured that with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the assistance of the worker brothers, as long as we work hard in production, we will be able to overcome the disaster victoriously." Sun Baozhen, a farmer in Wangguantun Village, Cangxian County, said with great emotion:
  "When farmers suffer from disasters, workers come to慰問 us. It is really a case of workers and farmers being of one heart. I will think of all kinds of ways to overcome the disaster. Next year, I will definitely plant more oil crops and grain crops to supply the country with industrial raw materials and grain." The Li Baorui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xihoutun Village was encouraged by the慰問 and immediately started sideline production.

    湖南省各界人民和河北省石家庄、邯郸两市职工
    组织慰问团深入水灾地区慰问灾民
    湖南省各界人民在十月下旬组织了慰问团，深入水灾地区慰问灾民，大大地鼓舞了灾区人民生产自救的热情。
    湖南省慰问团是由政府、军队、各民主党派、各人民团体联合组成的，全团包括工作人员在内共二百余人。他们分组在西洞庭湖区、南洞庭湖区和大通湖区进行重点访问，通过灾民代表会议向灾民表达各界人民的亲切关怀和热诚的问候，鼓励灾民在党和政府的领导下积极从事生产自救，战胜灾荒。
      水灾地区的人民对慰问团的亲切慰问感到异常兴奋，决心以生产自救的实际行动来答谢各界人民的关怀。曾经在湘阴黄花港防汛抢险斗争中，荣获集体模范称号的包市乡农民受到慰问后，准备抽出四百多个劳动力参加修复溃决的堤垸工作。慰问团访问益阳县一新乡的第二天，乡里民主农业生产合作社就动员了许多社员着手开荒，准备再播种五十亩油菜和其他冬季作物。

    十月下旬，河北省石家庄、邯郸两市职工组织慰问团慰问遭受水灾的农民。石家庄市职工慰问团采用灾民大会、小型座谈、个别访问等方式，慰问了安平、饶阳两县的灾民；邯郸市职工慰问团在沧县专区慰问了三个乡九个村和十二个农业生产合作社。饶阳县段君道村民生农业生产合作社的社员们受到慰问后，热情高涨，提前完成了一千二百五十亩种麦计划，迅速转入副业生产。社里盖房小组原计划七天时间盖六间房子，也提前三天盖好了。他们充满信心地对慰问团的职工说：“请你们回去转告工人同志们，叫他们放心，有共产党、毛主席的领导和工人老大哥的援助，只要努力生产，就能胜利地渡过灾荒。”沧县王官屯村农民孙保珍很感动地说：
  “农民受了灾，工人来慰问，真是工人农民心连心，我要想各种办法渡过灾荒，明年一定多种油料和粮食作物，供给国家工业原料和粮食。”西后屯村李保瑞农业生产合作社受到慰问鼓励，立即开展副业生产。
