Guangdong Province's sugarcane harvesting season has arrived. This year, the total sugarcane planting area in the province is more than 1.1 million mu, an increase of about 230,000 mu compared to last year. Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the sugarcane-producing areas this year, and with the assistance of state pre-purchases, loans, and fertilizer loans, sugarcane farmers have actively strengthened field management of sugarcane fields. As a result, sugarcane in most areas is growing well. The average yield per mu in the province is estimated to reach more than 6,000 jin. In the central Guangdong area, the unit area yield of 540,000 mu of sugarcane is estimated to reach more than 7,000 jin. In Shunde County in this area, nine agricultural production cooperatives have a total of 228 mu of sugarcane land, and the total output will reach more than 2.63 million jin, an increase of more than 60% compared to the total output when working individually last year. The total output of more than 1 million mu of sugarcane in the province will reach more than 70 million dan, an increase of about 40% compared to last year.

Currently, the five major sugar factories under the state-owned Guangdong Sugar Industry Company have started their machines to crush sugarcane. In order to enable the sugar factories to better complete the state's production tasks, the vast number of sugarcane farmers have expressed their guarantee to abide by the state's pre-purchase contracts and supply sugarcane in a timely manner.

    广东省今年甘蔗总产量将比去年增加四成
    广东省甘蔗的收获季节已到。今年全省甘蔗种植面积共一百一十多万亩，比去年增加了二十三万亩左右。由于今年蔗区互助合作运动的发展，和获得国家预购、贷款、贷肥等援助，蔗农积极加强蔗田的田间管理，因而各地甘蔗大部生长良好。全省平均每亩产量估计可达六千斤以上。粤中区的五十四万亩甘蔗，单位面积产量估计可达七千斤以上，该区顺德县九个农业生产合作社共有二百二十八亩蔗地，总产量将达二百六十三万多斤，比去年单干时的总产量增产百分之六十以上。全省一百多万亩甘蔗的总产量将达七千万担以上，约比去年增产百分之四十左右。
    现在，国营广东制糖工业公司所属的五大糖厂已开机榨蔗。广大蔗农为了使各糖厂更好的完成国家生产任务，都纷纷表示保证遵守国家预购合同，及时供应甘蔗。　（本报广东记者站）
