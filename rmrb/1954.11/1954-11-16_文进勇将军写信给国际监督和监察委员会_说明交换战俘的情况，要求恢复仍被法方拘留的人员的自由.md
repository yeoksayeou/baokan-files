Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, on the 14th, Văn Tiến Dũng, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission, sent a letter to the Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission on November 11th, according to the recommendation of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, explaining the situation regarding the exchange of prisoners of war up to now and the number of personnel still detained by the French Federation Forces.

The letter pointed out: Before the conclusion of the Geneva Accords, the Vietnam People's Army had already handed over 546 wounded and sick prisoners of war to the French Federation Forces. From the date the Geneva Accords came into effect until now, the Vietnam People's Army has handed over 12,173 prisoners of war, 587 political prisoners (including one brigadier general and one minister of the Bảo Đại government), and 583 officers to the French Federation Forces. In addition, Vietnamese volunteers and Lao combat troops in Laos have handed over 636 European and African prisoners of war captured in Laos and 39 Cambodian prisoners of war to the French side at Câm Thủy in northern Vietnam-China.

In addition, in the years before the cessation of hostilities, the Vietnam People's Army also repatriated a large number of prisoners of war in accordance with its lenient policy towards prisoners of war. According to incomplete statistics, from 1950 to the present, 4,026 European and African prisoners of war and 100,000 Vietnamese prisoners of war have been released.

Thus, the Vietnam People's Army has released all the prisoners of war and civilians it detained. It has been agreed at the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission that the Vietnam People's Army will continue to search further for the names put forward by the French side in order to reply to the delegation of the French Federation Forces.

Conversely, the French Federation Forces have been plotting to detain the prisoners of war still in their custody. Before the conclusion of the Geneva Accords, the French Federation Forces handed over 325 prisoners of war to the Vietnam People's Army. From the date the Geneva Ceasefire Accords came into effect until now, they have handed over 8,872 prisoners of war, 199 cadres, and 58,034 civilians to the Vietnam People's Army, including some women, elderly people, and children captured by the French army in mopping-up operations. In addition, the French Federation Forces released 109 people at Câm Thủy who were allegedly captured in Laos.

According to the above figures, the French Federation Forces are still detaining 7,107 prisoners of war, all of whom are listed on the list given by the French side to the Vietnam People's Army before August 26, 1954. However, this list does not include the names of many prisoners of war who were captured by the French Federation Forces in the past and are still in detention. From September 1st to November 9th, the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army submitted a list of 3,326 detainees to the delegation of the French Federation Forces, requesting them to investigate and release these detainees.

Recent news reveals that, in addition to those detained in small prisons in various regions, the French Federation Forces are still detaining 453 people in the large prisons on Côn Lôn Island and in the three provinces of Gia Định, Trà Vinh, and Mỹ Tho in South Vietnam. Currently, the French Federation Forces are planning to transform some political prisoners into ordinary criminals in order to avoid transfer. At the same time, the French side is stepping up searches and arrests in the fifth interzone of central Vietnam and in South Vietnam, arresting patriots who participated in the war of resistance in the past.

Văn Tiến Dũng finally pointed out in the letter: After the restoration of peace, some people have been released, some are still in detention, and many others have been arrested and imprisoned. We hope that the International Supervisory and Control Commission will investigate this issue so that those who are still in detention can regain their freedom.

    文进勇将军写信给国际监督和监察委员会
    说明交换战俘的情况，要求恢复仍被法方拘留的人员的自由
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社河内十四日讯：中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表文进勇根据国际监督和监察委员会的建议，在十一月十一日送给国际监督和监察委员会主席一封信，说明直到目前为止关于交换战俘的情况以及仍在法兰西联邦部队拘留下的人员的数目。
    信中指出：越南人民军方面在日内瓦协定缔结以前，已经把五百四十六名伤、病战俘交给法兰西联邦部队。从日内瓦协定生效日起到现在，越南人民军已经把一万二千一百七十三名战俘、五百八十七名政治犯（包括一名准将和保大政府的一名部长）和五百八十三名军官交给法兰西联邦部队。此外，老挝境内的越南志愿人员和寮国战斗部队已在中越北部的岑山把在老挝俘获的六百三十六名欧非籍战俘和三十九名柬埔寨战俘交给法方。
    此外，在停止敌对行动以前的几年内，越南人民军还根据对战俘宽大的政策，遣返了大批战俘。据不完全统计，从一九五零年直到现在，已有四千零二十六名欧非籍战俘和十万名越南籍战俘被释放。
    这样，越南人民军已释放了所拘留的全部战俘和平民。在中央联合停战委员会上已协议，越南人民军仍继续进一步查寻法方所提出的人名，以答复法兰西联邦部队代表团。
    相反地，法兰西联邦部队一直阴谋扣留仍在他们拘留下的战俘。在日内瓦协定缔结之前，法兰西联邦部队交给越南人民军三百二十五名战俘。从日内瓦停战协定生效日起到目前，它们交给越南人民军八千八百七十二名战俘、一百九十九名干部和五万八千零三十四名平民，其中包括法军在扫荡战中俘掳的一些妇女、老人和儿童。此外，法兰西联邦部队在岑山释放了一百零九名据说在老挝俘掳的人。
    根据上述数字，法兰西联邦部队仍扣留着七千一百零七名战俘，这些战俘都列在法方在一九五四年八月二十六日以前交给越南人民军的名单上。但是，这个名单还没有包括过去被法兰西联邦部队俘掳而目前仍在拘留中的许多战俘的名字。越南人民军代表团从九月一日到十一月九日，提出了三千三百二十六名被拘留者的名单，交给了法兰西联邦部队代表，要求他们查出并释放这些被拘留的人。
    最近消息透露，除了那些拘禁在各地区小监狱里的人之外，法兰西联邦部队在昆仑岛，在南越嘉定、茶荣、美萩三省的大监狱中仍扣留着四百五十三人。目前，法兰西联邦部队方面正计划把若干政治犯转化为普通犯人以便逃避移交。同时法方加紧在中越南部第五联区和南越进行搜捕，逮捕过去进行过抗战的爱国者。
    文进勇最后在信中指出：在和平恢复之后，有一些人被释放，有一些人还在拘留中，而另外又有许多人被逮捕下狱。我们希望国际监督和监察委员会将调查这个问题，以便使仍在拘留中的人恢复自由。
