    Hunan Province Dongting Lake Dike and Polder Restoration Project Partially Underway
    The Dongting Lake Dike and Polder Restoration Project in Hunan Province has smoothly completed various preparatory tasks before its commencement, and construction has begun in some areas.
    By the end of October, all levels of lake management organizations had been established, and cadres had been generally assigned. More than 2,000 cadres transferred from provincial-level organs to various locations to assist in lake management work have arrived at their designated locations. The organization of lake management materials and equipment has been basically completed, with approximately 170,000 tons already transported to construction sites, and 77 supply agencies have been established at various construction sites. Telecommunications and medical and health work are also progressing rapidly, with more than 700 kilometers of electric wires erected, and radio stations established in Caowei, Yougang, and Linzikou. More than 1,400 medical and health workers and more than 200 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners from health departments at all levels in the province have also successively taken up their posts. Most of the eight construction site hospitals and fifty-one medical and epidemic prevention stations have been set up according to plan. In terms of engineering surveying and reconnaissance, after round-the-clock work by more than 260 engineering personnel, the reconnaissance work for dike lines, flood channels, breach closures, and gate construction in the three key construction areas of West Dongting Lake, South Dongting Lake, and Datong Lake has been completed, measuring 1,000 kilometers of dike lines and more than 17,000 dike body cross-sections.
    Due to the slow water recession this year, which has affected the overall commencement of work, the current approach is to repair a section as it recedes, and repair a polder as it recedes. Xiangtan Prefecture is taking emergency measures to drain waterlogged areas, opening all river sluices and culverts, and deepening breaches to allow the waterlogged areas within the polders to recede quickly. A small number of polders in various counties that have already been drained of waterlogged areas have begun construction to repair dikes. Some polders in Lixian, Yiyang, Nanxian, and Huarong counties in Changde Prefecture successively commenced work around October 25th. Anxiang, which started construction earlier, had completed more than 467,000 cubic meters of earthwork by the end of October.

    湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程局部动工
    湖南省洞庭湖堤垸修复工程已顺利完成开工前的各项准备工作，部分地区开始兴工。
    到十月底止，各级治湖机构都已先后建立，干部也大致调配齐全。从省级机关调往各地协助治湖工作的二千多名干部已到达指定地点。治湖物资器材已基本上完成了组织工作，运到工地的已达十七万吨左右，并在各工地上设立了七十七个供应机构。电讯和医药卫生工作进展也很迅速，架设了七百多公里的电线，在草尾、酉港、临资口三个地方设立了电台。来自省内各级卫生部门的一千四百多名医务卫生工作人员和二百多名中医人员也陆续走上了工作岗位，八个工地医院和五十一个医疗防疫站大部已按计划设置妥当。工程测量、查勘方面，经过二百六十余名工程人员的昼夜赶工，已完成了西洞庭湖，南洞庭湖和大通湖三个重点工区的堤线洪道、堵口、建闸的查勘工作，测量了一千公里堤线和一万七千多个堤身断面。
    由于今年水退迟缓，影响了全面的开工，目前是采取退一块，修一块；退一垸，修一垸的办法。湘潭专区正采取排放渍水的紧急措施，将河?、涵闸全部打开，溃口挖深，使垸内渍水迅速退去。各县已经放干渍水的少数垸子已开始动工修堤。常德专区澧县、益阳、南县、华容等县部分垸子已于十月二十五日前后陆续开工。开工较早一些的安乡，到十月底止，已修了四十六万七千多土方。
