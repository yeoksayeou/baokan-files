Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: "Pravda" published an article entitled "Deceiving Public Opinion" which discussed the clumsy tricks of the enemies of European security.

    "Pravda" wrote: Those who instigate and support the revival of the revanchist Wehrmacht are still making hypocritical statements, talking about the "defensive nature" of the London and Paris agreements. The most hypocritical among them even say that they were "forced" to conclude these treaties because it was impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on unresolved European issues, primarily the German question. They deliberately conceal the Soviet Union's recent specific proposal: to promptly convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to discuss the most important issues related to European peace and security.

    Neither American diplomats nor their West German allies have enough courage to openly reject the Soviet proposal. They fear the righteous anger of the people of European countries who long for the easing of international tensions, so they are trying every possible means to deceive the public opinion of these countries, using vague promises of reaching agreements with the Soviet Union "in the future" to appease this public opinion. It is precisely for this purpose that they have consistently spread rumors, insisting that the four countries, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, can and should hold negotiations on the German question after the London and Paris agreements are ratified.

    "The Observer" pointed out that those who advocate holding negotiations on the German question after the London and Paris agreements are ratified are trying to convince public opinion that the appearance on the European stage of a West German army of 500,000 men, led by Hitler's generals, will help create a
  "peaceful atmosphere" conducive to resolving outstanding international issues.

    Such absurd arguments and assurances firstly show that their creators deliberately intend to deceive the deluded people of Western European countries.

    Indeed, is it not obvious that after the London and Paris agreements are ratified, West Germany can no longer be considered a peaceful country, and the reunification of Germany will be impossible for a long time to come?

    Moreover, is it not obvious that the arming of West Germany and its participation in the Atlantic bloc clearly violate the Franco-Soviet and Anglo-Soviet treaties of alliance and mutual assistance? In particular, the French government, by taking this step, must bear responsibility for the following two facts: as a result of this policy, France will face its old enemy - German militarism; and it will set itself against the Soviet Union, although the security of both countries requires them to work together to prevent the revival of German militarism.

    Finally, is it not also obvious that the ratification of the London and Paris agreements will severely undermine the plans for arms reduction and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, as well as the proposals put forward by Britain and France and supported by the Soviet government to achieve this goal?

    But it is impossible to propose both universal disarmament and the arming of West Germany! These two actions are incompatible.

    The article continued, saying that the claim by the advocates of reviving the West German Wehrmacht that merging the West German army into the Atlantic bloc would strengthen the security of Western Europe is equally false and misleading.

    In the more than nine years since the end of the war, no one has violated the security of France, Britain, or any other European country. The people of European countries have now realized that the myth of the
  "Soviet threat" spread by American propaganda is pure fabrication. Nevertheless, the ruling groups in Britain and France insist that the reason they agreed to rearm West Germany is to… defend themselves from the
  "Soviet threat" fabricated by the United States!

    More and more Europeans are beginning to realize that the real threat to their security comes precisely from the revanchist West German Wehrmacht that Western countries are now supporting. Only the extremely naive would believe that British and French generals subordinate to the American commander-in-chief of the Atlantic bloc could command the West German Wehrmacht. It is more likely that Hitler's generals, favored by the American military, would force French officers to obey their orders!

    The article continued, saying that it is very clear that the attempt by the American ruling groups and their British and French cronies to avoid negotiations with the Soviet Union on the extremely important issues concerning European security and peace is by no means in the interests of international cooperation.

    They want to avoid equal negotiations at present, so that in the future they can replace such negotiations with their dictatorial commands. They hope to rearm West Germany and make it join the aggressive Atlantic bloc to force the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to submit to their will.

    Such calculations are utterly naive! The Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out that the attempts by the United States and its allies to develop their relations with the Soviet Union "from a position of strength" have always been and will continue to be completely defeated. At present, this policy is even more inappropriate, because now even the enemies of the Soviet Union believe that the Soviet Union is stronger than before, and in the struggle for peace, the greatest Asian country, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries are advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union.

    The article pointed out that the American ruling groups and their Western European cronies do not have the courage to reveal to the world the truth about the London and Paris agreements and the possible consequences of these treaties. By talking about the possibility of holding four-power negotiations "in the future" "after the ratification of the London and Paris agreements," they want to conceal the true nature of this deal made between the most aggressive imperialist groups of the American, British, French, and West German bourgeoisie, a deal directed against the security of the European people, especially against the neighbors of Germany.

    The plotters of these aggressive plans know that they will not achieve their goals if the European people see through their intentions in time and prevent the revival of the West German militarist state. "Pravda" concluded by saying that, therefore, they have to use peace-loving words to cover up their aggressive plans, and have to talk about the possibility of holding "negotiations" on the German question "in the future" and play all kinds of conspiracies and tricks.

    欺骗舆论
    ——“真理报”“观察家”的文章的摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：“真理报”以“欺骗舆论”为题刊载了“观察家”的一篇文章，这篇文章谈到了欧洲安全的敌人的笨拙的花样。
    “真理报”写道：那些鼓动和支持复仇主义的国防军复活的人们到现在还在发表虚伪的言论，谈论伦敦和巴黎协定的“防御性质”。其中最假冒为善的人们还在说，他们是“不得不”缔结这些条约，因为不可能和苏联就争执不决的欧洲问题首先是德国问题的解决达成协议。对于苏联最近提出的具体建议：迅速召开法、英、美、苏四国外长会议以便讨论同欧洲和平和安全有关的最重要的问题，他们故意秘而不宣。
    无论美国外交家还是他们的西德盟友都没有足够的勇气来公开拒绝苏联的建议。他们害怕渴望缓和国际紧张局势的欧洲各国人民的正义的愤怒，因此他们正在千方百计地企图欺骗这些国家的舆论，用“将来”和苏联取得协议的模糊的诺言来平息这种舆论。正是为了达到这个目的，他们一贯地散布谣言，硬说英、法、美、苏四国可以而且应该在伦敦和巴黎协定获得批准后，就德国问题举行谈判。
    “观察家”指出，主张各有关国家在伦敦和巴黎协定得到批准以后再就德国问题举行谈判的人们企图使舆论界相信，一支由希特勒的将军们统率的五十万人的西德陆军出现在欧洲舞台上将有助于在欧洲创造一种有利于悬而未决的国际问题的解决的
  “和平气氛”。
    这种十分荒谬的论据和保证首先就表明了它们的制造者们蓄意欺骗西欧各国的被蒙蔽着的人民。
    的确，在伦敦和巴黎协定得到批准以后，就不能再认为西德是一个和平的国家了，在今后一个长时期内恢复德国统一就不可能了，难道这不是很明显的吗？
    而且，西德的武装和参加大西洋集团显然是违背法苏和英苏同盟互助条约的，难道这不是很明显的吗？特别是，法国政府采取了这种步骤就得对下面的两个事实承担责任：由于这种政策的结果，法国将会面临它的宿敌——德国军国主义；而且它将使它自己和苏联对立起来，虽然这两国的安全要求它们共同努力来防止德国军国主义的复活。
    最后，伦敦和巴黎协定的批准将使裁减军备和禁止核子武器的计划以及英法两国所提出的而且得到苏联政府支持的达到这种目的的建议遭受严重的打击，这难道不也是很明显的吗？
    但是，建议同时实行普遍裁减军备和武装西德，是办不到的！这两种行动是互不相容的。
    文章继续写道，复活西德国防军的鼓吹者们硬说把西德军队合并在大西洋集团内将会加强西欧的安全，这种说法是同样虚伪和错误的。
    在战争结束以来的九年多的时间里，没有任何人侵犯过法国、英国或任何其他欧洲国家的安全。欧洲各国人民现在已经认识到，美国宣传所散布的
  “苏联威胁”的神话纯粹是捏造。尽管如此，英国和法国的统治集团却硬说他们之所以同意重新武装西德是为了……保卫它们自己不受美国捏造出来的
  “苏联威胁”！
    愈来愈多的欧洲人开始认识到，对他们安全的真正威胁恰恰就来自西方国家现在正在扶植的复仇的西德国防军。只有极端幼稚的人才相信从属于大西洋集团的美国总司令的英法将军们能够叫西德国防军听话。如果说得到美国军方宠爱的希特勒将军们会迫使法国军官服从他们的命令的话，那倒还比较可能一些！
    文章继续说，非常明显，美国统治集团和他们的英法伙计们企图避免和苏联举行关于欧洲的安全和和平所系的极为重要的问题的谈判，这种行径绝不是从国际合作的利益出发的。
    他们想在目前避免平等的谈判，以便将来用他们的发号施令来代替这种谈判，他们希望重新武装西德和使它加入侵略性的大西洋集团，来迫使苏联和人民民主国家服从他们的意志。
    这种算盘打得再天真没有了！苏联政府一再指出，美国和它的盟国想从“实力地位出发”来发展它们和苏联的关系的企图过去一向而且将来还要遭到彻底的失败。目前，这种政策是更不恰当了，因为现在甚至苏联的敌人也认为，苏联比以前更强大了，而且在争取和平的斗争中，和苏联并肩前进的有最伟大的亚洲国家——中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家。
    文章指出，美国统治集团和他们的西欧伙计们没有勇气向全世界公众透露伦敦和巴黎协定的真相以及这些条约可能造成的后果。他们谈什么“将来”“在批准伦敦和巴黎协定以后”举行四国谈判的可能性，想这样来掩蔽美国、英国、法国和西德资产阶级的最富侵略性的帝国主义集团间所做的这笔矛头针对着欧洲人民的安全、首先是针对着德国邻国的安全的交易的真正性质。
    这些侵略计划的策划者知道，如果欧洲人民及时看出了他们的意图并阻止西德军国主义国家的复活，他们就达不到他们的目的了。“真理报”最后写道，因此，他们才不得不用爱好和平的词句来掩饰他们的侵略计划，不得不谈什么“将来”就德国问题举行“谈判”的可能性并玩弄各种阴谋和诡计。
