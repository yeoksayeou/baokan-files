    Capital Residents Participate in Voluntary Labor Sunday
    Every Sunday in the capital, thousands upon thousands of staff members from various organizations, students, soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and shop assistants participate in cheerful and lively voluntary labor at numerous construction sites. In the past four and a half months, over 40,000 people in the capital have participated in "Voluntary Labor Sunday." They have collectively excavated and backfilled over 15,000 cubic meters of earth, weeded over 200,000 square meters, and planted over 20,000 trees. (Xinhua News Agency)
