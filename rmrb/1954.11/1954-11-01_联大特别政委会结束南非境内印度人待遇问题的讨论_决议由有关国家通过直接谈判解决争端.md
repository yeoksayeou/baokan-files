Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th: The United Nations Special Political Committee concluded its discussion on the question of the treatment of Indians in the Union of South Africa on October 25th and passed a proposal from eight Latin American countries, according to TASS.

For more than eight years, the United Nations General Assembly has discussed this issue at its various sessions and made decisions. However, the South African government, with the support of certain countries, particularly colonial powers, has consistently refused to recognize the UN's right to do so, insisting that it constitutes interference in its internal affairs. It has also refused to cooperate with the UN "Good Offices" Commission established by the eighth session of the UN General Assembly, leaving the issue unresolved.

During the discussions, many national representatives pointed out the seriousness of the problem, arguing that it violated the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international agreements signed by the governments of India and South Africa on this issue. Others emphasized that the situation of Indians in the Union of South Africa was constantly deteriorating, discrimination against them was intensifying, and the UN should find a way to resolve the problem.

Soviet representative Zarubin stated at a committee meeting that the measures taken by the South African government against Indians within its borders violated the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Furthermore, the current situation to some extent harms friendly relations between the countries in dispute. Zarubin pointed out that discussing this issue and making recommendations undoubtedly fall within the purview of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet delegation believes that the United Nations General Assembly should continue its efforts and take appropriate measures to improve the situation of Indians residing in the Union of South Africa.

The committee passed the proposal of the eight Latin American countries with a majority of forty-seven votes. This proposal expresses the hope that the governments of India, Pakistan, and South Africa will resolve the issue through direct negotiations. The proposal also suggests that the parties concerned invite a government, agency, or individual to assist in resolving the issues between the relevant parties. The proposal recommends that if an agreement is not reached within the next six months, the Secretary-General of the United Nations should appoint a person to achieve the aforementioned purpose, and the Secretary-General will report on the progress of the work to the next session of the United Nations General Assembly. Only the delegation of South Africa voted against the proposal. The delegations of ten countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, abstained.

    联大特别政委会结束南非境内印度人待遇问题的讨论
    决议由有关国家通过直接谈判解决争端
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：联合国特别政治委员会十月二十五日结束了关于南非联邦境内印度人待遇问题的讨论，通过了八个拉丁美洲国家的提案。
    联合国大会八年多来在历次会议上都讨论过这个问题，并作出过决定。但是，由于南非联邦政府在某些国家、特别是殖民国家的支持下，始终拒绝承认联合国有这个权利，硬说这是干涉它的内政，并拒绝同联合国大会第八届会议所设立的联合国“斡旋”委员会合作，使这个问题一直悬而未决。
    在讨论中，许多国家代表指出了这个问题的严重性，认为这是破坏联合国宪章、人权宣言的基本原则和印度及南非联邦两国政府就这个问题签订的国际协定的问题。还有人着重指出，南非联邦境内印度人的状况不断恶化，对他们的歧视日益加深，联合国应当设法解决这个问题。
    苏联代表查鲁宾在委员会的一次会议上发言说，南非联邦政府对境内印度人采取的措施是违反联合国的宗旨和原则的。此外，目前的局势在某种程度上损害着在争执中的国家之间的友好关系。查鲁宾指出，就这个问题加以讨论并提出建议，毫无疑问是在联合国大会的职权范围之内的。苏联代表团认为，联合国大会应当继续努力，并采取相应措施来改善居住在南非联邦的印度人的状况。
    委员会以四十七票的多数通过了八个拉丁美洲国家代表团的提案。这项提案表示希望印度、巴基斯坦和南非联邦的政府通过直接谈判的方式解决这个问题。提案还建议，双方请某一政府、机关或个人来协助解决有关方面之间的问题。提案建议，如果在最近六个月中仍未能达成协议，联合国秘书长应当指定一人来达成上述目的，秘书长将向联合国大会下一次会议报告工作进展情况。投票反对这项提案的只有南非联邦的代表团。英国、法国、比利时、荷兰等十国代表团弃权。
