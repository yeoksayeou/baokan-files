    Anshan Builds Another Gas Storage Tank

    In the steel city of Anshan, a three-story wet gas storage tank is currently under construction. Anshan already has two gas storage tanks with a capacity of 10,000 cubic meters each, supplying gas to more than 11,100 households in Tiedong, Tiexi, and other districts. However, with the rapid development of production and construction, many newly built residences still lack gas installations.

    This newly built gas storage tank is located in Lishan. Once completed, it can supply gas for cooking to more than 13,200 households (nearly 70,000 people) in Ansteel's Taiping Village, Workers' Village, Youhao (Friendship) Street, both sides of Shengli (Victory) Road, and the southern part of Heping (Peace) District. This project began construction in early September, and the entire project will be completed and put into use in 1955. (Qu Liugong)

    鞍山又建一座煤气贮藏塔
    在钢都鞍山，目前正在建造一座三层湿式煤气贮藏塔。现在，鞍山已有两座容量一万立方公尺的煤气贮藏塔，供给着市内铁东、铁西等区一万一千一百多户使用，但随着生产建设的迅速发展，许多新建住宅还缺少煤气装置。
    这座新建的煤气贮藏塔位于立山，修成后可以供给鞍钢太平村、工人村、友好街和胜利路两侧以及和平区南部一万三千二百多户（将近七万人）做饭用的煤气。这项工程已于九月上旬开始施工，全部工程将在一九五五年竣工并开始利用。  （曲六功）
