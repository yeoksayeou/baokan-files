Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on the coastal islands of Zhejiang suffered heavy blows from the People's Liberation Army, the U.S. authorities openly dispatched warships to the waters near Dachen Island to support the panicked Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

According to a report from the U.S. destroyer "Evans" by "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Beighley, the "Evans" and other U.S. destroyers have sailed to patrol near Dachen Island, Zhejiang, in recent days. While en route to Dachen Island, the "Evans" also openly inspected ships from other countries, including a British warship and a British merchant ship. At the same time, foreign news agencies reported that the U.S. naval force in the Taiwan Strait has increased significantly, and U.S. warships are patrolling the Taiwan Strait day and night.

The U.S. authorities are also secretly negotiating with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to sign a so-called "mutual defense treaty." A U.S. State Department spokesperson admitted on November 6th that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson had discussed the issue of signing this so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang bandit "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao, who recently went to the United States for activities. According to the "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, the treaty being planned between the U.S. and Chiang will stipulate that the United States bears the same "obligations" to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as it does to South Korea and Japan. It is very clear that the U.S. authorities are attempting to protect the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique by concluding this aggressive treaty, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and turning Taiwan into a U.S. military base for aggression against China and Asia.

The U.S. authorities are also planning to rapidly provide the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with more military assistance to strengthen the Chiang bandit army's military strength. It is reported that the first batch of F-86 Sabre jet fighters provided by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will be shipped to Taiwan before the end of November. A group of Chiang bandit air force personnel currently receiving Sabre jet fighter pilot training in the United States will also return to Taiwan soon. At the same time, according to Kyodo News, the U.S. Far East Air Force authorities have proposed to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that two Japanese aircraft manufacturing companies—New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Showa Aircraft Industry—repair American-supplied jet fighters for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    美国当局加紧活动阻挠我国解放台湾
    【新华社八日讯】在盘踞浙江沿海岛屿的蒋贼军遭到人民解放军的沉重打击以后，美国当局公开派遣军舰到大陈岛附近海面，给惊慌失措的蒋介石卖国集团撑腰。
    据“纽约先驱论坛报”记者比加兹从美国驱逐舰“伊文斯号”上发出的报道，“伊文斯号”和其他美国驱逐舰已在最近几天内开往浙江沿海的大陈岛附近进行巡逻。“伊文斯号”在开往大陈岛途中还公开盘查其他国家的船只，其中包括一艘英国军舰和一艘英国商船。同时，据外国通讯社报道，台湾海峡内的美国海军力量已经显著增加，美国军舰正在台湾海峡内日夜巡逻。
    美国当局还正在和蒋介石卖国集团秘密谈判签订所谓“共同防御条约”。美国国务院发言人在十一月六日承认，美国国务卿杜勒斯和助理国务卿罗伯逊在过去几天中，同最近去美国进行活动的蒋贼
  “外交部长”叶公超讨论了签订这个所谓“共同防御条约”的问题。据“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者透露，美蒋之间正在策划的这个条约，将规定美国对蒋介石卖国集团负担同对南朝鲜和日本相同的“义务”。十分明显，美国当局企图通过缔结这个侵略条约来庇护蒋介石卖国集团，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，使台湾成为美国侵略中国和亚洲的军事基地。
    美国当局还在计划迅速给予蒋介石卖国集团更多的军事援助，加强蒋贼军的军事力量。有消息说，美国给予蒋介石卖国集团的第一批F—八十六型佩刀式喷气飞机将在十一月底以前运到台湾。目前正在美国受佩刀式喷气飞机驾驶训练的一批蒋贼空军人员也将在最近返回台湾。同时，据共同社报道，美国远东空军当局已经向蒋介石卖国集团提出两家日本飞机制造公司——新三菱重工业公司和昭和飞机工业公司，为蒋介石卖国集团修理美国供给的喷气飞机。
