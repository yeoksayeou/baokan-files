    Liaoning Province's Major Cities Strengthen Planned Grain Supply

    The planning aspect of grain supply has been greatly strengthened in industrial and mining cities in Liaoning Province such as Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, and Fushun, which have implemented planned grain supply. All cities have generally adjusted grain supply points, implementing a system of designated areas and fixed points with purchases made by certificate, preventing private grain merchants from hoarding, speculating, and engaging in profiteering activities, ensuring a rational grain supply for residents. Due to industrial development and population concentration, Shenyang's grain supply in the year after implementing planned grain supply increased by 13.4% compared to the previous year; Anshan increased by 27%; Fushun increased by 28%. Now, the grain supply points not only have sufficient quantities of grain but also a wide variety of types.

    Grain departments try their best to adjust grain types according to people's living habits and various different needs. Shenyang residents prefer sorghum rice, and this type of grain has always been supplied in large quantities in Shenyang; Anshan residents are accustomed to eating corn flour, and the grain department transfers a large amount of corn to Anshan. The grain departments also take good care of units such as hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, and kindergartens, ensuring a full supply of refined grains. There are also specialized outlets for supplying grain to various catering industries.

    Currently, cities like Anshan and Lushun-Dalian are promoting advanced experiences such as the "appointment sales system," which greatly facilitates grain purchases for the masses. Salespersons at grain supply points and supply and marketing cooperatives also frequently go deep into residential groups to understand the consumption habits and difficulties of the masses. Grain hoarding among residents has also been greatly reduced; generally, they buy grain to be consumed in the current month, complying with the state plan.

    Chongqing Municipality Adjusts Citywide Grain Supply Network

    The Grain Administration Bureau of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government has adjusted and reorganized the city's grain supply network. Currently, there are more than 170 state-owned grain stores and grain consignment stores and more than 100 rice processing plants distributed in various residential areas of the city, so that citizens can buy food at nearby grain stores at any time.

    Many of Chongqing's original grain stores and rice processing plants were concentrated in densely populated urban areas. In the years since liberation, the city has expanded towards the suburbs; however, many new urban areas, especially those where working people live, have few grain stores. Some suburban areas do not even have grain stores, making it very inconvenient for residents to buy grain. In July and August of this year, the Municipal People's Government Grain Administration Bureau implemented a "zoning and designation" supply method, forming a citywide grain supply network based on regional conditions, population density, and the grain-buying habits of citizens. Some grain consignment stores and rice processing plants concentrated in one location have been relocated to areas lacking grain stores and rice processing plants with the assistance of the People's Government. Grain stores have also been established in areas that previously had no grain stores, such as Wangye Temple, Huangjia Bridge, and Dafo Duan.

    辽宁省大城市加强粮食供应的计划性
    重庆市调整全市粮食供应网
    辽宁省沈阳、旅大、鞍山、抚顺等工矿城市，在实行粮食计划供应中，计划性大大加强。各城市普遍调整粮食供应点，实行分片定点、凭证购买的办法，防止了私营粮商囤积居奇、投机倒把等活动，保证了居民吃粮的合理供应。由于工业发展，人口集中，沈阳市在实行粮食计划供应的一年中所供应的粮食比前一年增加百分之十三点四；鞍山市增加百分之二十七；抚顺市增加百分之二十八。现在，各个粮食供应点里，不仅粮食的数量充足，品种也很多。
    粮食部门尽量根据人民生活习惯和各种不同需要来调剂粮食。沈阳市居民喜欢吃高粱米，这种粮食在沈阳市一直供应很多；安东市居民习惯吃玉米粉，粮食部门就把大量的玉米调运安东。对医院、疗养院、托儿所、幼儿园等单位，粮食部门照顾得也比较周到，保证充分供应细粮。对各饮食业的用粮也有专门的门市部供应。
    现在鞍山、旅大等城市正在推广“预约售货制”等先进经验，给群众买粮很大方便。粮食供应点和供销合作社的营业员们还经常深入到居民组里去了解群众的消费习惯和困难。居民中囤粮现象也大大减少，一般是当月吃当月买，服从国家计划。

    重庆市人民政府粮食管理局调整和整顿了全市粮食供应网。现在全市已有一百七十多家国营粮食店和粮食代销店、一百多家大米加工厂分布在市内各居民区，市民们随时可在附近的粮食店里买到食粮。
    重庆市原来的许多粮食店和大米加工厂多集中在人口稠密的市中心地区。解放后几年来，城市向郊区扩展了；但不少新的市区特别是劳动人民居住的地区粮食店很少。有的郊区甚至没有粮食店，居民买粮很不方便。今年七、八月间市人民政府粮食管理局实行“划片定点”的供应办法，按地区情况、人口稀密的程度和市民买粮的习惯，组成全市的粮食供应网。有些集中在一地的粮食代销店和大米加工厂，都在人民政府协助下迁移到缺乏粮食店和大米加工厂的地区。过去没有粮食店的王爷庙、黄家桥、大佛段等地区也都设立了粮食店。（新华社）
