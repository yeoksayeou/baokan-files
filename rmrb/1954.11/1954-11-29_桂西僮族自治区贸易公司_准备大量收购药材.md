    Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Trading Company
    Prepares to Purchase Large Quantities of Medicinal Materials

    The state-owned Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Trading Company is currently purchasing and preparing to purchase over a hundred kinds of medicinal materials to supply the needs of various regions. The Autonomous Region Trading Company has dispatched a group of medicinal material specialists to various counties and districts to assist supply and marketing cooperatives in identifying medicinal material specifications, collecting newly discovered medicinal material samples, and guiding farmers of all ethnic groups in collecting and cultivating medicinal materials.

    The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is one of China's main medicinal material producing areas. The amomum villosum, zanthoxylum, uncaria, geckos, pangolin scales, musk, and tienchi ginseng produced here are sold at home and abroad. This year, the amount of medicinal materials collected and cultivated by farmers of all ethnic groups has greatly increased. The output of tienchi ginseng in Mubian, Jingxi and other counties has doubled compared to last year. High-quality amomum villosum and coptis chinensis, and other valuable medicinal materials have recently been discovered in Wuming and the Yao Autonomous Region of Dayao Mountain.

    桂西僮族自治区贸易公司
    准备大量收购药材
    国营桂西僮族自治区贸易公司目前正在收购和准备收购一百多种药材，供应各地需要。自治区贸易公司已派了一批药材专业人员分别到各县、区帮助供销合作社鉴别药材规格，搜集新发现的药材样品，并指导各族农民搜集和种植药材。
    桂西僮族自治区是我国药材主要产地之一，这里出产的砂仁、茶辣、勾藤、蛤蚧、甲片、麝香、田七等药材，行销国内外。今年各族农民采集和种植药材的数量大大增加。睦边、靖西等县田七产量比去年增加一倍。武鸣和大瑶山瑶族自治区等地新近发现了品质很好的春砂仁、鸡爪黄连等贵重药材。（新华社）
