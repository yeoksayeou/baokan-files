To support farmers in Hubei Province in restoring production after the flooding, the people of Wuhan enthusiastically responded to the call of the Wuhan Committee for Supporting Hubei Province Disaster Area Farmers by Donating Winter Clothing, donating over 500,000 items of winter clothing (including cash for winter clothing), which have been transported to Jianli, Mianyang, Jiayu, Echeng, Hanchuan, and other counties. Among those donating winter clothing, the working class took the lead in providing enormous help to the disaster-stricken farmers. They donated a total of 215,806 items of winter clothing and over 15,184,000,000 yuan in cash. Cadres throughout the city also expressed boundless concern for the farmers in the disaster area. Comrade Wu Ruilan, who returned to the motherland from Malaya and is now working at the city's relief branch, donated ten brand-new cotton-padded coats, and included a letter of comfort in a cotton-padded jacket she sewed herself. Among the more than 17,000 items of winter clothing donated by universities and colleges, the new cotton-padded coats were all sewn by students and their families, who also wrote a large number of letters of comfort to express their warm regards to the farmers in the disaster area. The industrial and commercial sectors donated a total of 125,254 items of winter clothing and over 7,110,000,000 yuan in cash. The government will use the cash to help purchase cotton and cloth, which will be given to local women to make cotton-padded clothing. The women were very happy to hear that they were making cotton-padded clothing for the farmers in the disaster area, and they proposed "not wasting a single thread or an inch of cloth," carefully cutting and sewing. Women from 63 streets in the Jianghan, Jiang'an, and Qiaokou districts sewed more than 1,400 additional cotton-padded coats because they paid attention to saving fabric.

    武汉市人民捐献寒衣五十多万件
    为支援湖北省水灾地区的农民恢复生产，武汉市人民热烈响应武汉市支援湖北省灾区农民捐献寒衣委员会的号召，已捐出了五十多万件寒衣（包括寒衣代金），并分别运往监利、沔阳、嘉鱼、鄂城、汉川等县。在捐献寒衣当中，工人群众首先热诚地给了水灾地区农民弟兄巨大的帮助。他们共捐献二十一万五千八百零六件寒衣和一亿五千一百八十四万余元代金。全市干部对水灾区农民也寄以无限的关怀。从马来亚返回祖国现在市救济分会工作的伍瑞兰同志捐出了十件全新的棉衣，并在她亲手缝制的一件棉袄里包了她写的慰问信。在大专学校捐献的一万七千多件寒衣中，新棉衣都是由同学们和职工家属缝的，他们并写了大批的慰问信，向水灾区农民致以亲切的慰问。工商界捐献的寒衣共十二万五千二百五十四件，代金七十一亿一千余万元。代金由政府设法帮助购买棉花和布匹，交居民妇女负责制成棉衣。妇女们听说给水灾区农民做棉衣，非常高兴，大家提出“不浪费一根线、一寸布”，细心地裁剪和缝制。江汉、江岸和硚口三个区六十三条街道的妇女因为注意了节省布料，多缝了一千四百多件棉衣。
