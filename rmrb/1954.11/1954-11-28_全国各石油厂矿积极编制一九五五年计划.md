National petroleum factories and mines are actively compiling the 1955 plan. After the first planning conference of the petroleum industry, various planning organizations were generally established in petroleum factories and mines. In addition to establishing a core group for plan compilation, the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 also established a temporary Party branch and Communist Youth League branch to ensure the smooth progress of the plan compilation work.

The Northwest Yumen Oil Mine has conscientiously revised the civil engineering quota. According to the calculation based on the revised consumption quota of several major materials, a large amount of wealth can be saved for the country next year. For example, the revised quotas for sand, stone, and lime can be reduced by 10% to 20% compared with the current quotas this year; the loss rate of raw wood can also be reduced by 10%. It is estimated that the material cost per square meter of construction area next year can be saved by 45,500 yuan compared with this year. The mileage quota of the transportation brigade has been increased by an average of 10%, and the overhaul man-hour quota can also be reduced by 10%. The crude oil production of Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 6 can exceed the control figure issued by the higher authorities by more than 2%. The production and labor indicators of each workshop of the Southwest Longchang Carbon Black Factory have been discussed and determined. The preliminary audit results show that the output of the first tank of black field can be increased by at least 9% compared with the control figure issued by the higher authorities; the comprehensive carbon black generation rate can be increased by at least 4%.

In order to assist the petroleum enterprises in preparing the plan for next year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Petroleum Administration Bureau have sent a large number of cadres to work in the Northwest, Northeast, East China and other places.

    全国各石油厂矿积极编制一九五五年计划
   【本报讯】全国各石油厂矿正积极编制一九五五年计划。各石油厂矿在石油工业第一届计划会议之后，普遍成立了各种编制计划的机构。东北石油五厂除设立了计划编制的核心组外，还成立了临时党支部、团支部，以保证计划编制工作的顺利进行。
    西北玉门油矿认真修订了土木建筑定额，根据修订后的几项主要材料消耗定额测算，明年可为国家节约大量财富。如修订后的砂子、石头、石灰三项，就可比今年现行定额减少百分之十到百分之二十；元木的损耗率也可以降低百分之十，预计明年每平方公尺建筑面积可比今年节省材料费四万五千五百元。运输大队行驶定额平均提高了百分之十，大修工时定额也可以降低百分之十。东北石油六厂的原油产量可比上级颁发的控制数字超额百分之二以上。西南隆昌碳黑厂各车间的生产指标和劳动指标已经讨论确定，初步审核结果，第一槽黑场产量最少可比上级颁发的控制数字提高百分之九；碳黑综合生成率最少可提高百分之四。
    为了协助各石油企业做好明年计划的编制工作，燃料工业部、石油管理总局已派大批干部分别去西北、东北、华东等地工作。
