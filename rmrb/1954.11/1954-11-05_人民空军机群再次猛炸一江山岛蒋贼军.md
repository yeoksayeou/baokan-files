Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 4th: The People's Liberation Army Air Force units on the Zhejiang Front have once again fiercely bombed Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Yijiangshan Island. At 3:30 PM on the 4th, our People's Air Force flew over the positions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Yijiangshan Island and fiercely concentrated their bombing on the group fortifications in the Dongchang Village, Height 203, and the Central Village area, where Chiang Kai-shek's troops were assembled on the northern half of the island. Although there was a strong wind at the time, more than 95 percent of the bombs dropped by our air force hit their targets. All of the Chiang Kai-shek military targets that suffered devastating bombing caught fire.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 4th: Our frontline reporter reports on the battle progress of the People's Liberation Army artillery bombarding Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Yijiangshan Island:

At 5:00 PM on the 1st, a signal to open fire suddenly rose from the artillery positions of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Immediately, each artillery group began to fiercely bombard Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Yijiangshan Island. Standing at a high point on our position, the reporter looked through binoculars towards Yijiangshan Island across the sea, and saw flashes of fire where the shells landed, with plumes of black smoke soaring into the sky, then spreading out, the large and small peaks of the entire island swallowed by smoke.

On our army's position, the cannons roared non-stop. At a certain artillery position, Deputy Company Commander Liu Zhengfu waved his command flag with his right hand, and each cannon fired fiercely without pause. Telephone operators and messengers repeated the commander's orders, ammunition handlers busily carried shells, and aimers carefully corrected the bombing targets during the brief intervals between shellings. Fu Yinshan, a gunner of a certain artillery unit participating in the bombing of Chiang Kai-shek's troops' positions on Yijiangshan Island, said excitedly while turning the sight, "We will beat Chiang Kai-shek's troops black and blue, and blow up all their bunkers and barracks!" The shells fired from this cannon continuously exploded on the main peak of Yijiangshan, and a raging fire broke out on the main peak. Several barracks of Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the island were also turned into a sea of smoke and fire by hundreds of shells from our army.

At that time, a warship of Chiang Kai-shek's troops sailed from the direction of Dachen Island and frantically fired shells at our army. Our commander immediately ordered the bombardment of Chiang Kai-shek's warship, and a large number of shells flew towards Chiang Kai-shek's warship. The Chiang Kai-shek warship was so frightened that it quickly turned around and fled.

On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Yijiangshan Island, still in shock, suffered an even more severe blow from the People's Liberation Army Air Force. At 2:00 PM, the war eagles of our People's Air Force flew over the island and fiercely bombed the military targets on the island, then fiercely strafed the Chiang Kai-shek's troops' positions that had been set on fire by the bombing. When our Air Force completed its bombing mission and returned victoriously, a raging fire was still burning on the Chiang Kai-shek's troops' positions on Yijiangshan Island.

That night, our artillery units once again fiercely bombarded the Chiang Kai-shek's troops' positions on Yijiangshan Island for an hour, and destroyed the remaining positions of two artillery companies of Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

    人民空军机群再次猛炸一江山岛蒋贼军
    【新华社浙江前线四日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军空军部队再次猛烈轰炸一江山岛蒋贼军。四日下午三时三十分，我人民空军机群飞向一江山岛蒋贼军阵地上空，猛烈地集中轰炸了岛上北半部的蒋贼军集结的东昌村、二零三高地和中心村一带的集团工事。当时虽有大风，但我空军投下的炸弹仍有百分之九十五以上命中目标。受到毁灭性轰炸的蒋贼军军事目标，全部起火。
    【新华社浙江前线四日电】本社前线记者报道我人民解放军炮兵轰击一江山岛上蒋贼军的战斗经过：
    一日下午五时，在人民解放军某部的炮兵阵地上突然升起了开炮的讯号，顿时各个炮群一齐向一江山岛上蒋贼军猛烈地轰击起来。记者站在阵地的高处用望远镜向隔海的一江山岛看去，只见炮弹落下的地方火光迸发，一股股黑色的硝烟直冲天空，接着又弥漫开来，整个岛上的大、小山峰都被烟雾吞没了。
    在我军阵地上，大炮不停地怒吼着。在某一个炮兵阵地上，副连长刘正富右手挥动着指挥旗，各炮不停地猛烈射击着。电话员、传递员复诵着指挥员的命令，弹药手忙碌地搬运着炮弹，瞄准手利用短促的炮击间隙，细心地修正着轰击目标。参加轰击一江山岛蒋贼军阵地的某炮一炮手扶银山，一面转动着瞄准镜，一面兴奋地说：“我们要打得蒋贼军焦头烂额，要把他们的地堡、营房全部炸翻！”这门大炮发射出去的炮弹，不停地在一江山主峰上爆炸，主峰上燃起了熊熊烈火。岛上蒋贼军的几个兵营，也被我军数百发炮弹打成了一片烟火。
    当时，蒋贼军从大陈岛方向驶来了一艘军舰，慌乱地向我军发射炮弹。我军指挥员立即下令向蒋贼军舰轰击，大批炮弹就一齐向蒋贼军舰飞去。蒋贼军舰吓得连忙调头逃走了。
    二日下午，一江山岛上惊魂未定的蒋贼军又受到了我人民解放军空军机群更加严重的打击。下午二时，我人民空军的战鹰们飞到这个岛的上空，对岛上军事目标进行了猛烈的轰炸，接着又向被炸起火的蒋贼军阵地进行了猛烈的扫射。当我空军机群完成轰炸任务胜利返航以后，一江山岛蒋贼军阵地上还在燃烧着大火。
    当天晚上，我炮兵部队再次向一江山岛上的蒋贼军阵地狠狠地轰击了一个小时，又摧毁了蒋贼军残存的两个炮兵连的阵地。
