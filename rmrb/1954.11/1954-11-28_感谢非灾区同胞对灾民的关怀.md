    Thanks to Non-Disaster Area Compatriots for Their Concern for Disaster Victims
    Editor:
    It is an unforgettable event for the people who suffered from the flood to receive the concern and support of compatriots in non-disaster areas. We have repeatedly wanted to tell you about this and tell all those who care about us, but it has been delayed in the tense work of production and disaster relief.
    We thank the peasant brothers in Xianzhong District, Hanshan County, for their kind concern and selfless help. Let us express our feelings through the newspaper!
    When our ranks of disaster victims moved to Hanshan County, we felt a cordial and friendly atmosphere everywhere. Tea stalls were set up in villages of all sizes along the way, there was a temporary medical station every ten miles, and there were also people along the way acting as guides, pointing out the way for us.
    When we arrived in Xianzhong District, someone quickly led us to disperse to various villages, and many people enthusiastically came to help us carry burdens, hold children, and ask about our well-being; they let us live in their own houses, and brought us firewood, rice, and pickles, some even treated us like distinguished guests, inviting us to eat, more intimately than their own families. Because of the hot weather, the people living in Xiaowang Village, Changshan Township, were unwilling to sleep indoors, so the township cadres came to patrol back and forth every night to prevent wild wolves from coming down the mountain to harm the children, and patiently persuaded us to sleep indoors.
    Two women who were pregnant and about to give birth suddenly had children in the middle of the night, and Liu Shanglan, the director of the township women's federation, quickly took out one sheng of rice and five eggs to give to the mothers. Then, the women of the whole village donated two dou of rice, two hundred and thirty eggs, and three jin of brown sugar, and sent them to the two mothers with gongs and drums. They kindly comforted them and said, "We are all one family, it is our responsibility to take care of you." The mothers were very excited and said, "You take care of us so well, it is even better than at home, it is really true that farmers all over the world are one family." Disaster victim Zhou Fuli recalled the scene of the dike breach in 1931 and said that he went from Jiangnan to Jiangbei and became emaciated; the common people were like ants on a hot pot. At that time, the reactionaries didn't care about anything. No one asked if the common people died. Now, the Party and the government are even closer than parents.
    In order to help us solve various difficulties in life and production, the mountainous people gave up more than a thousand houses and took out more than 15,000 jin of firewood. They gave us their own gardens (about 24 mu) to grow vegetables, and took out a lot of seeds; they also allocated several thousand mu of newly reclaimed wasteland, planted late autumn seeds, and handed them over to us for harvesting free of charge. Under the leadership of the CCP Xianzhong District Committee and the Xianzhong District Production Brigade, we organized wasteland management squadrons, teams, and groups by township for production. According to incomplete statistics, the production resulted in more than 400 jin of mung beans, 400 jin of buckwheat, more than 1,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and tens of thousands of jin of potatoes.
    During the autumn plowing and planting season, the local people sent more than 1,000 dan of fertilizer, lent us hundreds of hoes and more than seventy plows and harrows every day, and the county-run animal husbandry station lent more than sixty cattle to help us cultivate the land. In this way, our autumn planting task was successfully completed in a very short period of time. Now, if you stand on the top of Mount Niliguan and look far away, the large area of wasteland has grown with lush green wheat seedlings, and it is estimated that we will be able to harvest 700,000 jin of wheat next year.
    Winter has arrived, and the People's Government has allocated more than 17.5 million yuan in winter clothing subsidies. The sewing workers in Xianzhong Town processed winter clothing for us, reducing the local cotton clothing wage from 18,000 yuan per set to 7,500 yuan. This great selfless friendship makes each of our disaster victims feel sincerely happy and warm.
    The kindness of the compatriots in Xianzhong District is endless. We are prepared to strengthen mutual aid and cooperation in the vigorous development of the production self-rescue movement to respond to their kindness.
    All disaster victims in Dougou District, Wuwei County, Anhui Province

### 感谢非灾区同胞对灾民的关怀

    感谢非灾区同胞对灾民的关怀编辑同志：
    遭受到水灾的人们得到非灾区同胞的关怀和支持，这是一件终身难忘的事情。我们屡次想把这件事告诉你，并告诉一切关怀我们的人们，后来在紧张的生产救灾的工作中延搁下来了。
    感谢含山县仙踪区的农民兄弟对我们的亲切关怀和无私的帮助。让我们通过报纸来表示我们的心意吧！
    当我们灾民的行列转移到含山县境时，我们觉得到处洋溢着亲切友爱的气氛。沿途大小村庄，设立了茶水站，每隔十里路就有一个临时医疗站，沿途还有人做向导，指点我们的去路。
    我们到了仙踪区，很快就有人领导我们分散到各个乡村去，许多群众热情地赶来替我们挑担子、抱小孩、问长问短；他们把自己住的房子让给我们住，把烧草、大米、咸菜拿来给我们，有的还像接待贵宾似地请我们去吃饭，比自家人还亲热。由于天气炎热，住在常山乡小王村的人都不愿睡在屋里，乡干部们每天晚上替我们来回放哨，防止野狼下山来伤害小孩，还耐心地劝说我们睡到屋里去。
    有两个怀孕临月的妇女，在半夜里忽然生孩子了，乡妇联主任刘尚兰连忙拿出了一升米、五个鸡蛋送给产妇。接着全村妇女捐出了大米二斗、鸡蛋二百三十个、红糖三斤，锣鼓喧天地送到两个产妇面前。他们亲切地慰问说：“我们都是一家人，照顾你们是我们的责任。”产妇很激动地说：“你们照顾得这样周到，比在家里还好，真是天下农民是一家。”灾民周伏理回想起一九三一年破圩的情景说，他从江南到江北，人瘦得脱了形；老百姓好比热锅上的蚂蚁。那时反动派什么也不管。老百姓死了也没人问。现在呢，党和政府比父母还亲。
    山区群众为了帮助我们解决生活和生产上的各种困难，让出了一千多间房屋，拿出了烧草一万五千多斤，他们把自己的园地（约有二十四亩）给我们种菜，拿出了很多种籽；还划出了好几千亩刚开垦的荒地，下好了晚秋种籽，无偿地交给我们收割。我们在中共仙踪区委和仙踪区生产大队的领导下，以乡为单位组织了荒山管理中队、分队、小组进行生产，生产的结果，据不完全统计，共收了绿豆四百多斤，荞麦四百斤，山芋一千多斤，马铃薯万把斤。
    在秋耕秋种时，当地群众送来了一千多担肥料，每天借给我们几百把锄头、七十多张犁、耙，县国营畜牧站借给六十多条牛，帮助我们耕地。这样，我们的秋种任务在很短时期内就顺利完成了。现在你若站在?笠关的山头上远远望去，那大片的荒地上已经生长了绿油油的麦苗，估计明年有把握能收七十万斤小麦。
    冬天到了，人民政府拨来了寒衣补助费一千七百五十多万元。仙踪镇的缝纫业工人替我们加工寒衣，按当地棉衣工资每套一万八千元降低到七千五百元。这种伟大的无私的友谊，使我们每个灾民由衷地感到愉快和温暖。
    仙踪区同胞们的恩情是说不完的，我们准备在全力开展生产自救运动中加强互助合作来回答他们的盛意。 安徽省无为县陡沟区全体灾民
