The agricultural production cooperative led by Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en, winners of the Patriotic丰产金星 (Gold Star) Medal, can increase its grain income by an estimated more than 5,000 jin through careful harvesting and threshing.

Now, a vivid picture of meticulous autumn harvesting is presented everywhere in Xigou Township and Chuandi Township. The male and female cooperative members participating in the autumn harvest in the two cooperatives gently cut down the millet and carefully bundle it up, and then carry the bundles full of heavy millet ears to the threshing ground. The inspection team members traveling back and forth in the fields carefully picked up all the lost millet ears. On the threshing ground, young girls and women formed circles and nervously cut the millet ears, carefully flipping and counting them several times with each cut. The millet of the eleven labor groups of the Chuandi Township Agricultural Production Cooperative was threshed one more time. The first and second labor groups threshed out ninety-four jin of millet from fifty-one piles of millet chaff. After the Chidi production team of the Xigou Township Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative finished threshing the millet, they carried out a re-threshing.

On October 12th, Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en, representatives of the National People's Congress, returned to Xigou Township and Chuandi Township and conveyed the situation of the first session of the First National People's Congress to the cooperative members. After the cooperative members learned about the floods that occurred in some areas this year, they all said: "Harvesting a little more grain will reduce the disaster by a bit, and will increase the country's construction power by a bit." They came up with careful harvesting and threshing methods such as lifting the ears to cut the grain, carefully harvesting and handling lightly, and bundling and transporting as they cut. Each labor group divided up responsibility areas for careful harvesting and threshing, and established a reward and punishment system for careful harvesting and threshing, and established inspection teams. They put forward the slogans of clean ground, clean roads, clean threshing grounds, and clean stalks, and launched a competition for careful threshing and harvesting.

At present, the millet of these two agricultural production cooperatives has been completely harvested, and the cooperative members have begun to harvest corn. According to everyone's decision, in order to reduce the loss of corn shelling, all corn is transported in bags to the threshing ground for peeling. (Xinhua News Agency)

    李顺达、郭玉恩领导的农业生产合作社
    在秋收中细收细打可多收粮食五千多斤
    爱国丰产金星奖章获得者李顺达、郭玉恩所领导的农业生产合作社细收细打，预计能增加五千多斤粮食的收入。
    现在，西沟乡和川底乡到处呈现一幅精心秋收的生动图景。两个社参加收秋的男女社员们，轻轻割倒谷子再小心的捆起，然后把挂满沉甸甸谷穗的捆子背到打谷场去。往返在田间的检查组组员，仔细地把丢掉的谷穗都拣了起来。在打谷场上，青年姑娘和妇女们围成圆圈紧张地切谷穗，她们每切一下总要仔细地翻看数次。川底乡农业生产合作社十一个劳动小组的谷子都多打了一次，第一、第二劳动小组在五十一堆谷糠中扬出九十四斤谷子。西沟乡农林畜牧生产合作社池底生产分队碾完谷子后，又进行翻打。
    十月十二日，全国人民代表大会代表李顺达、郭玉恩回到西沟乡和川底乡后，便向本社社员传达了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的情况。当社员们得知今年部分地区发生水灾的情况后，都说：多收一点粮，多减一分灾，就多给国家增加一分建设力量。他们想出提穗割谷、细收轻放、随割随捆随搬运等细收细打办法。各劳动小组划分了细收细打责任区，并订出细收细打奖惩制度，成立了检查组。他们提出地净、道净、场净、秸净的口号，展开细打细收竞赛。
    目前，这两个农业生产合作社的谷子已全部收割完毕，社员们开始收割玉米。按照大家的决定，为了减少玉米脱粒损失，全部玉米都用口袋装运，到场脱皮。　（新华社）
