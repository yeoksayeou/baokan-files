    Under the Comprehensive Assistance of the Soviet Union
    Wang Yintian, Secretary of the CPC Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory Committee

    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory's complete entry into the production phase marks a step forward in the technical level of China's machinery manufacturing industry. This factory was built in just three years from design to completion. Given China's technological backwardness and lack of experience, it would have been impossible to build such a factory in such a short period of time without the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union.

    From the factory's overall layout to equipment manufacturing, product blueprints, various product technical operating procedures, and production organization management design, all were designed with Soviet assistance. The design books and drawings for preliminary design, technical design, organizational design, consumption quotas, etc., alone amount to more than 70,000 pages. These materials provide regulations for organizational structure, management methods, division of labor, operating procedures, and even the specific layout of warehouses, truly meticulous. These designs are concentrated and developed from the advanced experience of the existing tool manufacturing industry in the Soviet Union, and all aspects demonstrate technical advancement. For example, two-millimeter dies and 0.25-millimeter ground-groove high-speed steel drill bits took a considerable amount of time to be produced in batches in the Soviet Union, but with the help of the Soviet Union, our factory expects to produce them in batches next year.

    The use of industrialized and mechanized methods in construction is also the result of the suggestions and specific assistance of experts Ivakin and Dadalinzev. We also dared to break the seasonal restrictions and carry out winter construction in Harbin for the first time under the active advocacy and enthusiastic help of experts. The measuring tool factory building, the three-story office building, and the 44-meter-high central water tower built during the winter construction in 1953 fully met the quality standards and created a good example for winter construction. During the construction process, experts put forward more than 2,600 suggestions from various aspects. Implementing these suggestions has accelerated the progress of the project, ensured the quality of the project, greatly reduced waste, and saved the country's investment. For example, the rapid demolding steam curing method of reinforced concrete suggested by experts shortened the curing period of concrete prefabrication from the original 14 to 28 days to 16 to 24 hours. The woodworking workshop improved equipment according to the experts' suggestions, increasing the production of herringbone flooring from 10 square meters per person per day to 100 square meters. Adopting the suggestion of using paint additives instead of pure paint saved more than 600 million yuan.

    More than 95% of the automated and semi-automated equipment of the measuring and cutting tool factory is supplied by the Soviet Union. In order to ensure that the measuring and cutting tool factory can be put into production as early as possible, the Soviet Union organized more than 50 well-known factories such as the "Red Proletarian Machine Tool Factory" to manufacture equipment. This equipment is technically first-rate. For example, the machine tools for manufacturing drill bits are fully automatically controlled from feeding to clamping, milling grooves, and milling blades. One worker can supervise three machines. Each machine can mill a drill bit in just four minutes. A special vertical milling machine for milling the tail of the drill bit, according to experts, was specially designed for our factory. It can continuously mill 40 drill bits at a time, while ordinary milling machines only mill one at a time. The precision boring machine for manufacturing precision products can achieve a bore distance accuracy of one-thousandth of a millimeter, which is equal to one-twentieth of the thickness of the thinnest cellophane. Among the main machines supplied by the Soviet Union, 43% were first produced in 1953 or 1954. For example, special vertical milling machines, micrometer pads, and grinding machines, etc., are not only new products designed by the Soviet Union, but also the first of the new products. There are also four new automatic screw grinding machines, which are the number one, two, three, and four of the new products. This shows that these machines have not been used in the Soviet Union either. For general auxiliary equipment, the Soviet Union also tries its best to help China manufacture it itself, as long as our country can manufacture it. Some equipment we never even thought of, but the Soviet Union designed it for us. For example, iron filings and used waste oil cut down by machine tools are generally regarded as waste in our existing factories. Now, the Soviet Union has designed a chip crusher and an oil regenerator for us. The chip crusher enables us to send the iron filings that have become "waste" back to the steel plant for remelting into useful steel after crushing and packaging; the oil regenerator enables us to extract useful machine oil from waste oil.

    Although the equipment supplied by the Soviet Union is accompanied by detailed installation instructions, it is impossible to install it well relying only on our current technical level. This also requires a series of assistance from Soviet experts. In January of this year, after expert Kazlov arrived at the factory, he found that the installation position of some machine tools in the die workshop was inappropriate, so he helped design a re-adjustment. In the two months before and after, he had to go to the workshop two or three times almost every day, personally measured with the workers with a tape measure, and personally helped move the machine tools until each process and each machine met the requirements of safety, rationality, sufficient light and neatness and beauty before finalizing the plan. Why did the expert help and guide so tirelessly? The following paragraph from expert Kazlov is an pertinent answer. He said: "If I arrange it myself, it may be arranged in one day, but our purpose is to teach Chinese comrades what they don't know. Now Chinese comrades can arrange machines, this is how our task is completed."

    When the construction and installation project was leaping forward and the direct production preparation work was urgent, production experts from various aspects arrived one after another. They specifically guided the workers to operate in the workshop every day, so that many workers were able to operate machines they had never seen before in just a few months and produce products that meet the design requirements.

    In order to achieve the goal of "China also having a large number of its own experts," experts paid special attention to the technical training of employees. Comrade Kaldelin suggested organizing 200 various technical workers in the factory to learn technology. In order to realize this plan, Soviet experts personally wrote study outlines for lathe workers, explained to the workers, and demonstrated operations for the workers on the more special machine tools that had already started.

    What we will never forget is the working spirit of the experts.

    I remember at the end of May last year, Dadalinzev's first sentence to the factory director after arriving at the construction site from Moscow was: "How is the on-site construction going?" After he understood the general situation from everyone's words, he immediately stood up and said, "Comrade Factory Director, let me go to the site to see!" Everyone present whispered in surprise: "Look, that's how solid the Soviet comrades are." During the construction process, even in the pouring rain, you could see two construction experts on the site. They were wearing grass-colored raincoats and rolling up their trouser legs, sometimes climbing on the steel frame of the high-altitude factory building to check each screw eye; sometimes holding the slippery handrail to go to the deep wells of the upper and lower water pipes. When they climbed to the most dangerous places, translators and employees often sweated for them, but they forgot everything. They often tell people: "Wind and rain cannot stop us. If we wait and see, we will become prisoners of nature!"

    Although expert Ivakin is an old man with gray hair, he still often personally operates and demonstrates on the construction site during winter construction. Once, while he was guiding at the scene, he found that the Lin Hongxun group did not follow the method taught by the experts when building the corner of the wall. He took off his coat and gloves without hesitation and laid bricks himself. The hot air exhaled from his mouth immediately formed white ice on his eyebrows, but he always smiled, explaining and operating, without regard to the cold. The workers said with emotion: "In the old society, you would kowtow a hundred times to the master, and he would still hold something back, but our Soviet elder brother is helping us like this!" But when the vast number of employees thanked him for this great help, he said very modestly: "We should thank the masses of workers. As for me, I am just a drop of water in the ocean. I hope to dedicate all my strength to China's construction, and I also hope to teach all my skills to Chinese comrades, so that the Chinese people have countless experts of their own, even better experts than me."

    在苏联全面的援助下
    中共哈尔滨量具刃具厂委员会书记  王荫田
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的全部进入掌握生产阶段，标志着我国机械制造工业技术水平的向前迈进一步。这个厂从设计到建成，只用三年时间。在我国技术落后、经验缺乏的情况下，如果没有苏联全面的援助，要在这样短的时间内建设这样的工厂，是不可能的。
    从工厂的整体布置到设备制造、产品图纸、各种产品的技术操作规程和生产组织管理设计，都由苏联帮助设计好了。单是初步设计、技术设计、组织设计、消耗定额等设计书和图纸就有七万多页。这些资料对于组织机构、管理方法、分工范围、操作规程以至仓库的具体布置都有规定，真是无微不至。这些设计都是集中了苏联现有的工具制造业先进经验加以发展的，各方面都表现了技术上的先进性。例如二公厘的板牙和零点二五公厘的磨沟高速钢钻头，在苏联，经过相当长时间才正式成批生产，但我们工厂在苏联的帮助下，预计明年就能成批生产。
    在建设中采用工厂化、机械化的方法，也是依瓦基和达达林则夫两位专家的建议和具体帮助的结果。我们也是在专家积极的倡议和热情的帮助下，才敢于打破了季节性的限制，第一次在哈尔滨实行冬季施工。在一九五三年冬季施工中的量具厂房、三层办公大楼与高达四十四公尺的中央水塔，完全合乎质量标准，给冬季施工创造了好的范例。在施工过程中专家从各方面提出二千六百多件建议。我们贯彻了这些建议，就能加速了工程进度，保证了工程的质量，大大减少浪费，节省国家的投资。例如采用专家建议的钢筋混凝土快速脱模蒸气养生法，就使混凝土预制品的养生期由原十四天到二十八天缩短到十六小时至二十四小时。木工车间根据专家建议改进设备，使人字地板制造由一人一天十平方公尺提高到一百平方公尺。采用以油漆掺用剂代替了纯油漆的建议就节省了六亿余元。
    量具刃具厂的自动化和半自动化的设备，百分之九十五以上是苏联供应的。为了保证量具刃具厂能提早投入生产，苏联组织了像“红色无产者机床制造厂”等五十余个有名的工厂来制造设备。这些设备在技术上是头等的。例如制造钻头的机床，从送料到卡料、铣沟、铣刃，全部是自动控制，一个工人可以看管三台。每台机器只要四分钟就可以铣
  一个钻头。铣钻头尾部的一台特殊立式铣床，据专家谈，是为我们工厂专门设计的，它一次可以连续铣四十根钻头，而普通铣床每次只铣一根。制造精密产品的精密镗床，搪孔距离精度能达到千分之一公厘，即等于最薄的玻璃纸薄度的二十分之一。在苏联供给的主要机器中，有百分之四十三是一九五三年或一九五四年才第一次出厂的。如特殊立式铣床、千分垫、研磨机等三十余台精密机床，不但是苏联新设计出来的新产品，并且是新产品中的第一号。还有四台新型的自动螺丝磨床，是新产品的一、二、三、四号。这说明这些机器在苏联也是没有使用过的。一般的辅助设备，凡是我国能制造的，苏联也尽量帮助我国自己制造。有的设备我们连想都未想到，而苏联都给我们设计出来。如机床切削下来的铁屑和用过的废油，在我国现有的工厂里，一般的都被当做废物了。现在，苏联给我们设计了一部切屑破碎机和一部油料再生器。切屑破碎机使我们把已成“废料”的铁屑经过破碎包装后，送回炼钢厂重新炼成有用的钢材；油料再生器使我们能从废油中提出有用的机油。
    苏联供给我们设备，虽都附有详细的安装说明，但只依靠我们现在的技术水平是不可能安装好的。这也要靠苏联专家给以一系列的帮助。今年一月，卡兹洛夫专家到厂后，发现板牙车间部分机床安装的位置不妥当，就帮助设计重新调整。前后两个月的时间内，他差不多每天都要到车间两三次，拿着胶尺亲自同工人一起测量，并亲自动手帮助搬动机床，直到使每一工序、每一机器都符合安全合理，光线充足和整齐美观的要求才定案。专家为什么要这样不厌其烦的帮助和指导呢？专家卡兹洛夫下面一段话就是一个中肯的答复，他说：“假如由我自己排的话，也许一天就排好了，不过我们的目的是教会中国同志不会的东西，现在中国同志会排机器了，这才完成了我们的任务”。
    当建筑安装工程正在飞跃进展，直接的生产准备工作正迫不及待的时候，各方面的生产专家就陆续地到来。他们每天都在车间具体指导工人操作，因而有不少工人，在短短的几个月内能操作从没见过的机器，并能制造出符合于设计要求的产品来。
    专家为了达到“中国也有大量的自己的专家”的目的，特别注意职工的技术培训工作。卡尔德林同志建议在厂里组织二百名各种技术工人学习技术。为了实现这个计划，苏联专家亲自为车工写学习提纲，给工人讲解，并在已开工的比较特殊的机床上为工人示范操作。
    最使我们铭记不忘的，是专家的工作精神。
    记得去年五月末，达达林则夫刚从莫斯科到工地，见厂长的第一句话就是：“现场的施工情况怎样？”当他从大家的话中了解了概况以后，马上立起来，说：“厂长同志，就让我到现场去看吧！”在座的人都惊讶地耳语：“瞧，人家苏联同志就是那么踏实”。在施工过程中，即使大雨滂沱，也会在现场里看到两位建筑专家。他们穿着草色雨衣，撩起裤腿，有时爬在高空厂房的钢架上，检查每个螺丝眼；有时扶着油滑的扶梯到上下水道的深井去。当他们爬在最危险的地方时，翻译人员和职工常常为他们捏一把汗，但是他们却忘了一切。他们常常告诉人们：“风雨是阻挡不了我们的，我们如果等待和观望，那就会做自然的俘虏！”
    专家依瓦基虽已是头发斑白的老人，但在冬季施工中仍经常在工地亲自操作示范。有一次他在现场指导时发现林洪勋小组砌墙拐角时并未按照专家教导的方法做，他便毫不犹豫的脱下大衣，摘下手套，亲自动手砌砖。口里呼出的热气马上就在眉毛上结成了白冰，可是他始终微笑着，一面讲解，一面操作，毫不顾及寒冷。工人感动地说：“在旧社会里向师父磕一百个响头，他还要留一手，咱们苏联老大哥却是这样的帮助咱！”但当广大职工感谢他这种伟大帮助时，他却很谦逊地说：“应该感谢工人群众，至于我仅不过是大海中的一滴水珠。我希望能把自己的一切力量献给中国的建设事业，我也希望把自己的一切本领教给中国同志，使中国人民有无数自己的专家，甚至比我更好的专家。”
