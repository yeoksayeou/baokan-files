    [Dispatch from this newspaper] Workers in factories, mines, transportation, and construction enterprises across the country are comprehensively launching labor competitions and striving to increase production and practice economy. Since entering the fourth quarter, many industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises have mobilized the masses of workers to oppose waste and tap production potential, and have revised their plans for increasing production and practicing economy. According to the preliminary plans of more than 100 factories and transportation enterprises in Tianjin, they will be able to hand over an additional 705 billion yuan to the state this year. Twenty state-owned factories and mines and twenty-eight local state-owned factories and railway transportation units in Heilongjiang Province will increase production and practice economy by more than 1,049 billion yuan for the state by the end of the year. State-owned factories and mines in Guizhou Province have proposed to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 40 billion yuan on the basis of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan. Workers at the State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have proposed to save 850 million yuan in the fourth quarter. Workers in various factories in Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province, are also actively implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and launching labor competitions. In addition to ensuring the comprehensive completion of the fourth quarter plan, they will also strive to overfulfill the task of handing over 825 million yuan in profits.
    In the labor competition, many enterprises have achieved remarkable results. The State-owned Qingdao No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory saved an average of 5.16 jin of cotton per yarn. In October, the oil yield of the Hongche and Dingzha workshops of the State-owned Wuhan Oil Factory exceeded the original planned targets. Without increasing raw materials, the total monthly output of sesame oil increased by 918 jin and rapeseed oil by 6,740 jin. Since the launch of the labor competition, the workers of the Wuhan Public-Private Joint Venture Fuxin Flour Mill have repeatedly broken the flour extraction rate targets. In October, they completed 107.97 percent of the output plan, and saved 56,000 jin of raw wheat for the state. In October, the various cement pipes produced by the Zhongnan Cement Pipe Factory's mechanism saved a total of 61,090 kilograms of cement due to the full implementation of the Soviet advanced proportioning method of weight ratio. The cost was 6.2 percent lower than in September, the compressive strength of the finished product was 70 percent higher than in the past, and the reject rate was reduced to 0.96 percent. The average cotton consumption per yarn at the Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Anda Textile Factory No. 1 has been reduced below the state cotton allocation standard. In September and October, while ensuring the quality of cotton yarn, a total of more than 22,000 jin of raw cotton was saved. In October, the State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory reduced the amount of cotton and yarn used, and improved the hemp rope and bamboo panels used for packing, saving the state 370 million yuan. Workers in the oil extraction workshop of the Faku Local State-owned Oil and Rice Processing Factory in Liaoning Province deeply studied Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction experience in the competition. Since processing new soybeans, the oil yield has been increasing day by day. Now it has increased from 13 jin and 4 liang of oil per 100 jin of soybeans (second-class soybeans) to 15 jin, 6 liang and 3 qian, breaking the state quota and changing the so-called "new soybeans do not produce oil" erroneous perception. By the end of the year, it will increase the production of more than 18,000 jin of soybean oil for the state.
    Workers in construction enterprises across the country have also launched labor competitions, and some construction sites have achieved results in accelerating project progress and saving state investment. Workers at the expansion site of the Shenyang Wire Factory implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in the labor competition, changing the technical design of the reinforcement of the main plant beam frame and the new concrete columns, so that the entire construction project of the main plant can be completed half a year in advance, and the investment can be reduced by more than 30 billion yuan. After the launch of the labor competition in Lushun-Dalian, the efficiency of carpenters increased by an average of 18 percent, and the efficiency of plasterers increased by an average of 21 percent. The workers at the construction sites of the Tangshan Construction Engineering Company attach great importance to saving materials. To date, the company has saved more than 32 billion yuan in construction costs for the state.

    各地厂矿、交通和建筑企业
    广大职工努力增产节约
    【本报讯】各地厂矿、交通和建筑企业职工全面展开劳动竞赛，努力增产节约。进入第四季度以来，许多工矿、交通企业发动职工群众反对浪费现象，挖掘生产潜力，修订了增产节约计划。据天津市一百多个工厂、交通企业的初步计划，今年能多向国家上缴七千零五十亿元；黑龙江省二十个国营厂矿和二十八个地方国营工厂和铁路运输等单位，到年底将给国家增产节约一万零四十九亿多元；贵州省地方国营厂矿提出在全面完成国家计划的基础上，要完成增产节约四百亿元的任务；国营西北第一棉纺织厂职工，提出要在第四季度节约八亿五千万元。江苏省泰州市各工厂职工也积极贯彻增产节约精神，展开劳动竞赛，他们除保证全面完成第四季度计划外，还要争取超额完成八亿二千五百万元的上缴利润。
    各地在劳动竞赛中，已有许多企业取得了显著成绩。国营青岛第七棉纺织厂每件纱平均节约了五点一六斤棉花。在十月份，国营武汉油厂红车和顶榨两个车间的出油率都突破了原定计划指标，在不增加原料的情况下，全月共多产麻油九百一十八斤，菜油六千七百四十多斤。武汉市公私合营福新面粉厂的职工从开展劳动竞赛后，屡次突破出粉率的指标，十月份完成产量计划百分之一百零七点九七，并给国家节约了五万六千斤原麦。中南水泥制管厂机制的各种水泥管，十月份由于全部实行了苏联的重量比的先进配料法，共节省了六万一千零九十公斤水泥，成本比九月份降低了百分之六点二，制成品的耐压力比过去提高百分之七十，废品率降低到百分之零点九六。上海公私合营安达纺织一厂每件纱的平均用棉量，已降低到国家配棉标准以下，九、十两个月在保证棉纱品质的前提下，共节约原棉两万二千多斤。国营西北第一棉纺织厂在十月份降低了用棉和用纱量，改进了打包用的麻绳和竹板，给国家节约了三亿七千万元。辽宁省法库地方国营油米加工厂制油车间工人，在竞赛中深入地学习了李川江榨油经验，从加工新大豆以来，出油率逐日上升，现在已由每百斤大豆（二等豆）出油十三斤四两提高到十五斤六两三钱，突破了国家定额，改变了所谓“新大豆不出油”的错误认识，到年底能给国家增产一万八千多斤豆油。
    各地建筑企业职工也展开了劳动竞赛，有些工地在加速工程进度和节约国家投资方面取得了成绩。沈阳电线厂的扩建工地职工在劳动竞赛中贯彻苏联专家建议，改变了主厂房梁架加固和新建混凝土柱子的技术设计，使主厂房的全部建筑工程可以提前半年完工，并可减少投资三十多亿元。旅大市开展劳动竞赛后，木工的效率平均提高了百分之十八，抹灰工效率平均提高了百分之二十一。唐山市建筑工程公司各工地的工人都很重视节约材料，该公司到目前已给国家节约了三十二亿多元的建筑费用。
