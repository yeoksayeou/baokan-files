Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are enthusiastically selling oilseeds to the state. By October 20th, the region had purchased more than 20,000 tons of oilseeds.
	In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, oilseed crops mature later. However, in the past 20 days, more than 1,000 tons of castor beans have been purchased. The Hetao Administrative Region exceeded its monthly oilseed procurement plan for October in the first half of the month. By October 26th, the Pingdiquan Administrative Region had completed 116% of its October procurement plan. Wudong County had completed more than 81% of its annual procurement task by October 15th. The Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Panzhuang Township, Tumote Banner, sold all of its remaining 7,000+ jin of oilseeds to the state. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the Fifth District of Urad Front Banner, who had signed advance purchase contracts with the state, have all sold their oilseeds to the state according to the contracts, and exceeded their original plans. Under their influence, farmers throughout the region have sold large quantities of flax.
	This year, the broad masses of farmers in Gansu Province enthusiastically responded to the state's call to increase oilseed production. Without affecting the increased production of grain and cotton, they expanded the planting area of oilseed crops by about 40% compared to last year. The Jiuquan Special District planted more than 65,000 mu of flax this year, more than double that of last year. At present, oilseed crops in most areas have been harvested, and the yield per unit area has generally increased compared to last year. In some areas of Yumen County, the average yield of flax reached as high as 260+ jin per mu. It is estimated that the yield per mu in the province this year will increase by about 10.73% compared to last year.
	In the work of procuring oilseeds, all localities widely publicized the significance and methods of the state's monopoly purchase and marketing of oilseeds, and conscientiously implemented the price policy of "grading and pricing". The broad masses of farmers enthusiastically sold oilseeds to support the state's socialist industrialization. Farmers in Huangzui Township, Seventh District of Li County, harvested more than 55,000 jin of rapeseed, and have now sold more than 44,000 jin to the state. They said: In order to support industrial construction and accumulate funds to expand agricultural production, eating a little less oil now will mean more oil to eat in the future. Farmers in Shuangtabao Township, Third District of Anxi County, sold more than 25,000 jin of oilseeds to the state in five days, exceeding the township's oilseed monopoly purchase task. According to incomplete statistics, as of October 15th, the oilseeds purchased throughout the province, including flax seeds, rapeseed, sesame, castor beans, sunflower seeds, peanuts, etc., have reached more than 26 million jin.

    内蒙古和甘肃省农民把大量油料卖给国家
    内蒙古自治区各族农民正踊跃把油料卖给国家。到十月二十日止，全区已收购油料两万多吨。
    内蒙古东部地区油料作物成熟较晚，在最近二十天内也收购了一千多吨蓖麻籽。河套行政区在十月份上半月就超额完成了全月的油料收购计划。平地泉行政区到十月二十六日，已完成十月份收购计划百分之一百一十六；武东县截至十月十五日止，已完成全年收购任务的百分之八十一以上。土默特旗潘庄乡和平农业生产合作社把剩余的七千多斤油料全部卖给了国家。乌拉特前旗第五区同国家签订过预购合同的农业生产合作社和互助组，都已按合同把油料卖给国家，并超过了原来的计划。在他们的影响下，全区农民已卖出大量胡麻。
    今年甘肃省广大农民热烈响应国家增产油料的号召，在不影响粮、棉增产的原则下，比去年扩大油料作物播种面积百分之四十左右。酒泉专区今年播种胡麻六万五千多亩，比去年增加一倍多。目前，大部地区油料作物已经收割完毕，单位面积产量普遍比去年有所增加。玉门县有的地区胡麻产量每亩平均高达二百六十多斤。据估计，今年全省每亩产量比去年提高约百分之十点七三。
    在收购油料的工作中，各地广泛宣传了油料统购统销的意义和办法，认真执行了“分等论价”的价格政策。广大农民踊跃出售油籽，支援国家社会主义工业化。礼县第七区黄咀乡农民共打了菜籽五万五千多斤，现已卖给国家四万四千多斤。他们说：为了支援工业建设，积累资金扩大农业生产，目前少吃点油，将来会有更多的油吃。安西县第三区双塔堡乡农民五天内卖给国家油籽二万五千多斤，超额完成了全乡油料统购任务。据不完全的统计，截至十月十五日，全省收购的油料，包括胡麻籽、菜籽、芝麻、蓖麻籽、葵花籽、花生等，已达二千六百多万斤。
