    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Capital Construction Department Formulates Plan
    to Systematically Learn from Soviet Experts
    Southwest Iron and Steel Company Rewards Employees Who Successfully Implement Expert Advice
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Capital Construction Department has formulated a plan to learn from Soviet experts within the next year so as to independently carry out technical and management work in the construction and installation of ferrous metallurgical enterprises.
    This large-scale cadre training plan was initially drafted at a meeting of business section chiefs and managers of specialized engineering companies on November 3rd, based on the spirit of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Soviet Expert Work Conference, and after reviewing the learning from Soviet experts in various units over the past few years. To implement this plan, each specialized engineering company is organizing experienced engineering and technical personnel to form technical teams to systematically learn from Soviet experts, so as to train them as the core of technical leadership and as technical assistants to managers; organizing various specialized engineering teams to learn advanced Soviet construction methods; and holding lectures on various specialized issues in conjunction with work needs, inviting Soviet experts to give lectures. The meeting also designated special personnel to review and summarize the important experiences in technology and management learned from Soviet experts over the past few years before the end of the year in order to promote them.
    Currently, specialized engineering companies such as electrical installation, mechanical installation, and industrial furnace construction are adopting methods such as holding exhibitions to educate employees, overcome ideological obstacles, and form a mass upsurge of comprehensively learning from advanced Soviet experience.

    Southwest Iron and Steel Company has allocated a sum of money from the manager's fund to reward employees of its Chongqing factories who have achieved success in implementing the advice of Soviet experts, and to further mobilize and organize employees to better learn from Soviet experts.
    Many advanced individuals have emerged in Chongqing's steel plants in the process of learning and implementing the advice of Soviet experts. For example, Zhou Zong, an engineer in the refractory materials workshop of Steel Plant 101, actively collected and prepared materials, asked experts for advice, and promptly organized employees to learn and implement expert advice, improving the work of the refractory workshop. Li Zhenggao, chief foreman of the rolling mill workshop of Steel Plant 102, actively studied the advice of Soviet experts on the role of slab pickling and suggested changing to pickling semi-finished products, greatly improving the quality of steel plates. After implementing the advice of Soviet experts, the kiln firing team of the steelmaking workshop of Steel Plant 102 achieved moisture content in lime below the expert's required standard, which played a certain role in improving the quality of steel. They were all rewarded this time.
    Due to the implementation of Soviet experts' advice, the production technology level of Chongqing's steel plants has been significantly improved. Before September, Steel Plant 101's No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces averaged about six hours per heat, which has been shortened to five hours and eighteen minutes in October. After Steel Plant 102 successfully tested large magnesium sand brick furnace walls, the lifespan of electric furnaces has been extended to more than 166 heats. The monthly operating rate of Steel Plant 104's open-hearth furnaces has increased to over 91%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门订出计划
    向苏联专家进行有系统的学习
    西南钢铁公司奖励贯彻专家建议有成绩的职工
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门已订出在今后的一年时间内，向苏联专家学会独立进行黑色冶金企业建筑安装工程的技术和管理工作的计划。
    这个大规模的培养干部的计划，是基本建设部门根据重工业部苏联专家工作会议的精神，检查了各单位几年来向苏联专家学习的情况以后，在十一月三日召开的各业务处长、各专业工程公司经理会议上初步拟订的。为实现这个计划，各专业工程公司都在组织有经验的工程技术人员成立技术小组，向苏联专家进行有系统的学习，以便把他们培养成为技术领导的核心，充当经理的技术助手；组织各种专业工程队学习苏联先进的施工方法；结合工作需要举办各种专门问题的讲座，请苏联专家讲课。这次会议并指定专人在年底以前，把几年来向苏联专家学到的技术和管理方面的重要经验，加以检查总结，以便推广。
    现在，电气安装、机械安装、工业筑炉等专业工程公司，正采取举办展览会等方式，教育职工，克服思想障碍，以形成群众性的全面学习苏联先进经验的高潮。（新华社）
    西南钢铁公司已从经理基金内拨出一笔奖金，奖励所属重庆各厂贯彻苏联专家建议有成绩的职工，并进一步发动和组织职工更好地向苏联专家学习。
    重庆各钢铁厂在学习和贯彻苏联专家建议中，出现了不少先进人物。如一零一钢铁厂耐火材料车间工程师周宗积极汇集准备资料，提出问题向专家请教，并及时整理专家建议，组织职工学习和贯彻改进了耐火车间的工作。一零二钢铁厂轧钢车间总工长李正高积极钻研苏联专家关于板胚酸洗的作用的建议，并建议改洗半成品，大大提高了钢板质量。一零二钢铁厂炼钢车间烧窑组在贯彻苏联专家建议后，石灰内的含水量达到了专家要求的指标以下，对提高钢的质量起了一定作用。他们这次都受到了奖励。
    重庆各钢铁厂由于贯彻苏联专家建议，生产技术水平显著提高了。一零一钢铁厂的一号和二号平炉九月份以前平均每炼一炉要六小时左右，十月份已缩短到五小时十八分。一零二钢铁厂试验大块镁砂砖炉墙成功后，电炉炉龄已延长到一百六十六炉以上。一零四钢铁厂平炉月作业率已提高到百分之九十一以上。（新华社）
