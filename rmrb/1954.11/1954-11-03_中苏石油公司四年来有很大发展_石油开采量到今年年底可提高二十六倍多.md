    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Chinese and Soviet governments and with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts and the joint efforts of workers of all nationalities, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company has achieved great development in production over the past four years since its establishment. In 1953, drilling footage increased by 4.082 times compared to 1951, and is expected to increase to 4.962 times by the end of this year. In 1953, oil production increased by 24.743 times compared to 1951, and is expected to increase to 26.724 times by the end of this year. In 1953, gasoline production was 34.766 times that of 1951, kerosene was 5.654 times, and diesel was 45.665 times; it is expected that by the end of this year, gasoline production will increase to 51.681 times that of 1951, kerosene will increase to 11.035 times, and diesel will increase to 51.110 times.
    With the development of production, the workforce has continued to expand, and the lives of workers have gradually improved. In 1953, the number of employees increased by 3.640 times compared to 1951, and is expected to increase to 3.968 times this year; in 1953, the total salary of employees increased to 4.787 times compared to 1951, and this year it increased again to 5.106 times. In 1953, the residential area increased to 5.562 times compared to 1951, and is expected to increase to 9.386 times this year. This year, the company also established a nursery and built an open-air cinema, dance floor, and employee club.
    The large-scale automated cracking refinery, which began construction last year, was officially put into production in May of this year. With the increase in refining volume and the improvement in quality, gasoline prices this year have been reduced by 56.7 percent compared to 1951, kerosene prices have been reduced by 77.6 percent, and diesel prices have been reduced by 77.9 percent. This has played a significant role in the economic construction of Xinjiang. Last year, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company also built a general mechanical repair factory. The workshops put into production have all completed their production tasks on a monthly basis. The total value of products from January to August this year increased by 2.08 times compared to last year. In the labor competition to welcome National Day, workers successfully installed a self-made oil tanker on the Mas-type vehicle—a new type of diesel-fueled ten-ton truck—and the quality fully met the standards designed by the Petroleum Administration Bureau.
    Over the past few years, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company has produced many model workers, who have become the driving force for promoting production. Under the leadership of Wang Bingcheng, a special-class labor model, the No. 89 drilling team created a national drilling record of 230 meters per day on June 24th this year. Currently, all drilling teams in the mining area, driven by the youth drilling team led by Wang Bingcheng, are enthusiastically carrying out labor competitions. Bayakexi (Kazak), a mechanic at the oilfield, used the methane gas in crude oil to replace the oil pressure pump, improved the device of the oil pressure tank, and saved two oil pumps and two workers. He Shengyu, a model Communist Youth League member and fitter in the construction and installation section, completed the annual task of making oil tanks in eight months and saved the state materials worth more than 75 million yuan. Nasharkin (Soviet), a diesel engine worker, used a diesel engine for 5,000 consecutive hours without major repairs, exceeding the quota time by nearly two times. The company's aircraft traveled more than 40,000 kilometers, far exceeding the overhaul quota time.
    After the announcement of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, workers of all nationalities expressed their determination to unite closely, learn from Soviet advanced experience more deeply, enhance the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, overfulfill production tasks, and build the company even better. Mula Lifu (Uyghur), a labor model from the construction department, said: "In the past, I could only do some simple work. Since coming to the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company, with the patient help of Soviet experts, I have quickly improved my skills, and now I can make complex parts. To thank the Soviet experts for their help and to consolidate the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, I guarantee to study Soviet advanced technology and experience even harder, and unite all comrades in the group to complete the national production plan."

    中苏石油公司四年来有很大发展
    石油开采量到今年年底可提高二十六倍多
    【本报讯】中苏石油股份公司成立四年来，在中苏两国政府的领导下，在苏联专家的热情帮助和各民族职工共同努力下，生产有了很大的发展。一九五三年钻井进尺比一九五一年提高了四点零八二倍，预计今年年底可提高到四点九六二倍。一九五三年石油的开采量比一九五一年提高了二十四点七四三倍，预计今年年底可提高到二十六点七二四倍。一九五三年汽油的产量为一九五一年的三十四点七六六倍，煤油为五点六五四倍，柴油为四十五点六六五倍；预计今年年底汽油的产量较一九五一年可提高到五十一点六八一倍，煤油可提高到一十一点零三五倍，柴油可提高到五十一点一一零倍。
    随着生产的发展，职工队伍不断扩大，职工生活也逐步得到了改善。一九五三年职工人数较一九五一年提高三点六四零倍，今年可增加到三点九六八倍；一九五三年员工工资总额较一九五一年增加到四点七八七倍，今年又增加到五点一零六倍。一九五三年住宅面积较一九五一年增加到五点五六二倍，预计今年可提高到九点三八六倍。今年公司里又成立了托儿所，新建了露天电影场、跳舞场和职工俱乐部。
    去年动工修筑的规模宏大的自动化裂化炼油厂，已在今年五月正式投入生产。随着炼油量的增加和质量的提高，今年的汽油价格就比一九五一年降低了百分之五十六点七，煤油价格降低了百分之七十七点六，柴油价格降低了百分之七十七点九。这对新疆的经济建设起了不小的作用。 去年中苏石油公司还修建了总机械修理工厂。投入生产的车间，都是按月完成了生产任务。今年一至八月的产品总值就比去年提高了二点零八倍。在迎接国庆节的劳动竞赛中，工人在马斯型车——燃烧柴油载重十吨的新型汽车——安装自制的油槽车成功了，质量完全达到石油管理总局所设计的标准。
    几年来，中苏石油股份公司涌现了不少的模范工作者，他们已成为推进生产的动力。八十九号钻井队在特等劳动模范王炳诚领导下，今年六月二十四日，创造了日进二百三十公尺的全国钻井最高纪录。目前矿区各钻井队在王炳诚领导的青年钻井队的带动下，热烈开展了劳动竞赛。油田处机械师巴亚克西（哈萨克族）利用原油中的瓦斯气代替压油泵，改进了压油罐的装置，节省了两台油泵和两名工人。模范青年团员、建筑安装工段钳工何生玉，八个月就完成了全年制作油罐的任务；并为国家节省材料价值七千五百多万元。柴油机工纳沙尔金（苏方）连续使用柴油机五千小时没有大修，超过定额时间将近两倍。公司的飞机航行了四万多公里，远远超过了大修定额时间。
    在中苏会谈公报公布后，各族职工都纷纷表示要亲密团结，更加深入地学习苏联先进经验，增进中苏两国人民的友谊，超额完成生产任务，把公司建设得更好。建筑处劳动模范木拉立夫（维吾尔族）说：“过去我只能干一些简单的活，自从到中苏石油股份公司后，在苏联专家耐心的帮助下，很快提高了技术，现在我已经能作复杂的零件了。为了感谢苏联专家的帮助，为了巩固中苏友好同盟，我保证更加努力学习苏联先进技术经验，团结全组同志完成国家生产计划。”
