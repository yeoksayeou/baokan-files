Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th - Indonesian newspapers have further published facts about certain colonial countries instigating subversive activities in Indonesia. "Merdeka" reported on the 15th that certain Western countries have allocated a huge sum of 750 million rupiahs for the purpose of overthrowing the current Indonesian government.

"Merdeka" said that these activities organized by Western countries with huge interests in Indonesia are led by some Dutch people, one of whom is the head of a large Dutch enterprise in Indonesia. According to "Merdeka," when the Greater Indonesia Unity Party held its national congress in Solo, this Dutchman was in Solo; at that national congress, some members of the Greater Indonesia Unity Party attempted to forcibly pass resolutions aimed at overthrowing the current cabinet.

"Merdeka" also pointed out that a senior official of an Iranian oil company that once used 100 million US dollars to help overthrow the Mossadegh government in Iran recently came to Indonesia.

"Merdeka" said that among the "utilized people" involved in this conspiracy to overthrow the government, many are former Dutch intelligence personnel; they have infiltrated various government departments and are trying to build relationships with high-ranking Indonesians. They also provide intelligence to the armed bandits in West Java. These bandits have recently intensified their sabotage activities.

"Kompas" said that the High Court is now interrogating two Americans. "Kompas" implied that these two Americans have very close ties with opposition leaders.

Other newspapers reported that imperialists have allocated millions of rupiahs to the Tajuddin Noor group of the Greater Indonesia Unity Party.

These newspapers also reported that agents of Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company and the American New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company are sabotaging transportation in Jakarta and other cities in Indonesia by manipulating gasoline prices.

"The Indonesian Observer" pointed out in an editorial on the 11th that Indonesia's willingness to maintain neutrality has become a thorn in the side of certain countries, which is an open secret. They intend to have other figures in power to drag Indonesia into a camp engaged in the Cold War. To achieve this goal, they use bribery to buy over weak-willed politicians to work for them. In the past three months, they have made various attempts to overthrow the government.

"The Indonesian Observer" said that certain leading figures may become rich because foreign interest groups are keen on using money to influence the political situation in Indonesia. However, they will never achieve their goals in Indonesia. The vast majority of Indonesian people believe that any cheap attempts to win people's hearts are suspicious.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th - At the cabinet reshuffle committee meeting held on the 15th, the Indonesian National People's Party accepted the position of Minister of Land and nominated G. Lakim, chairman of the National People's Party parliamentary group, as Minister of Land. The cabinet will meet on the 17th to approve this appointment. The work of filling the cabinet vacancies has now been completed.

According to officials quoted in the newspapers, the issue of filling the vacancy of the First Deputy Prime Minister was not discussed at the cabinet reshuffle committee meeting on the 15th, which may mean that this position will not be filled by anyone for the time being.

    印度尼西亚报纸揭发帝国主义的颠覆活动
    印度尼西亚内阁补缺工作已经完成
    【新华社雅加达十六日电】印度尼西亚报纸进一步发表了某些殖民国家在印度尼西亚策动颠覆活动的事实。“独立报”十五日报道说，某些西方国家已经拨出了七亿五千万盾的巨款作为推翻印度尼西亚现政府之用。
    “独立报”说，在印度尼西亚有巨大利益的西方国家所组织的这些活动，是由一些荷兰人领导的，其中有一个人是在印度尼西亚的荷兰大企业的负责人。据“独立报”说，当大印度尼西亚统一党在梭罗举行全国代表大会时，这个荷兰人正在梭罗；在那次全国代表大会上，一些大印度尼西亚统一党党员曾试图强行通过目的在于推翻现内阁的决议。
    “独立报”还指出：曾经用一亿美元来帮助推翻伊朗摩萨台政府的伊朗某石油公司的高级人员，不久以前来到印度尼西亚。
    “独立报”说，参与这个推翻政府阴谋的“被利用的人”当中，有许多是以前的荷兰情报处人员；他们渗入到政府各部门，并力图同地位高的印度尼西亚人拉关系。他们并且把情报供给西爪哇的武装匪帮。这些匪帮最近加紧了它们的破坏活动。
    “指南针报”说，高等法院现在正在审问两个美国人。“指南针报”暗示，这两个美国人和反对派的领导者有很密切的联系。
    其他报纸报道，帝国主义者已拨出了数百万盾给大印度尼西亚统一党的塔朱丁·诺尔集团。
    这些报纸并且报道，荷兰皇家壳牌石油公司和美国新泽西—纽约美孚油公司的代理人正在以操纵汽油价格的手段来破坏雅加达和印度尼西亚其他城市的交通。
    “印度尼西亚观察家报”曾在十一日的社论中指出，印度尼西亚愿意保持中立一事已成为某些国家的眼中钉，这已经是一种公开的秘密。它们打算使其他人物执政来把印度尼西亚拉进一个正在从事冷战的阵营。为了达到这个目的，它们采用行贿的办法，收买意志薄弱的政客们为它们效力。在过去三个月中，它们已经作了推翻政府的种种尝试。
    “印度尼西亚观察家报”说，某些首脑分子可能因为外国利益集团热中于用金钱以影响印度尼西亚的政治局势而发财致富。但是，他们永远不能在印度尼西亚达到他们的目的，印度尼西亚的广大人民认为任何廉价的笼络人心的活动都是可疑的。
    【新华社雅加达十六日电】在十五日举行的内阁改组委员会会议上，印度尼西亚国家人民党接受了土地部部长的职位，并提名国家人民党国会党团主席格·拉克任土地部部长。内阁将在十七日开会批准这一任命。内阁补缺工作至此业已完成。
    据报纸刊载的官方人士谈话说，在十五日的内阁改组委员会会议上并没有讨论第一副总理出缺的问题，这可能意味着这一职位目前将不由任何人补缺。
