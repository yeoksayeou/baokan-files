Yangqiao Township Corrects the Deviation of Blindly Expanding Agricultural Cooperatives

    Yangqiao Township in Qianjiang County, Hubei Province, has corrected the deviation of blindly expanding agricultural production cooperatives, bringing the mutual aid and cooperation movement onto a normal path of development. Yangqiao Township is a disaster area. After carrying out production and disaster relief activities centered on mutual aid and cooperation, the masses showed great enthusiasm for taking the socialist road and actively demanded to establish cooperatives. At that time, the Party branch did not grasp the principle of necessity and possibility, only seeing the positive side of the masses' enthusiasm. It blindly expanded the original three cooperatives from 33 households to 249 households, one of which was expanded from 12 households to 188 households; 27 mutual aid teams with more than 240 households were merged into five cooperatives, and 54 individual farmers were absorbed to participate. After discovering this situation, the work team immediately convened a branch meeting to publicize the central government's mutual aid and cooperation policies, and analyzed the mutual aid and cooperation situation in the entire township with the branch committee: The township established cooperatives at the beginning of this year, and cadres generally lacked the ability and experience to lead large cooperatives. Problems were constantly occurring in the current small cooperatives, and more problems would arise after establishing large cooperatives. After understanding these situations, the branch committee members felt that blindly establishing large cooperatives would bring difficulties to the future work of consolidating the cooperatives. Therefore, they publicized the mutual aid and cooperation policies to the masses, and in conjunction with this work, explained the situation and policies to the members of the cooperatives and teams in large meetings, small meetings, and individual conversations. After such explanations, the cadres and the masses agreed to reduce the size of the cooperative's organization. Under the leadership of the work team and the Party branch, it was determined that the original cooperatives should not exceed 30 households at most; mutual aid teams with strong backbones and a good foundation should be converted into cooperatives in batches, and teams that did not meet the conditions for conversion should still carry out mutual aid; temporary mutual aid teams were organized for the more than 50 individual farmers who had joined the cooperatives to prepare for winter sowing and dike repair.

    杨桥乡纠正了盲目扩大农业合作社的偏向
    湖北省潜江县杨桥乡纠正盲目扩大农业生产合作社的偏向，使互助合作运动向着正常的方向发展。杨桥乡是灾区，经过以互助合作为中心开展生产救灾运动后，群众走社会主义道路的热情很高，积极要求办社。当时党支部没有掌握需要与可能的原则，只看见群众情绪好的一面，便盲目地把原有三个社由三十三户扩大到二百四十九户，其中有一个由十二户扩大为一百八十八户；把二十七个互助组的二百四十多户合并为五个社，并吸收单干农民五十四户参加。工作组发现这种情况后，随即召开支部会议宣传中央的互助合作政策，并和支委分析了全乡的互助合作情况：乡里今年初办社，干部普遍缺乏领导大社的能力和经验，目前的小社已不断发生问题，办大社后问题就要更多。支委认识这些情况后，都感到盲目办大社将给今后巩固社的工作带来困难，于是向群众宣传互助合作政策，结合这一工作，在大会、小会和个别交谈中，分别向社员、组员说明情况和政策。经过这样说明，干部、群众都同意缩小社的组织。在工作组和党支部的领导下，确定原有的社最大不超过三十户；骨干强基础好的互助组分批转社，不够转社条件的组仍进行互助；对于已入社的五十余户单干农民，组织临时互助组，迎接冬播和修堤。（本报湖北记者站）
