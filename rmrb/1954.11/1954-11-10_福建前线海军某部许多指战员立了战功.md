Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 9th: A certain naval unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front held a congress of model heroes on November 5th. More than 100 delegates attending the meeting unanimously adopted a resolution to "continue to strengthen military and political training and strive for the victorious liberation of Taiwan."

From January to October this year, this People's Navy unit fought more than 200 battles against the Chiang bandit army, sinking one Chiang bandit naval gunboat, damaging a total of three Chiang bandit naval warships and gunboats, shooting down and damaging three Chiang bandit planes each, destroying two Chiang bandit military artillery positions, capturing 53 Chiang bandit soldiers, and killing or wounding more than 100 Chiang bandit officers and soldiers.

In the course of successfully completing various combat missions, this naval unit produced a total of 364 people's heroes and models, and seven units were awarded collective merits. Zhou Qing, a third-class meritorious person and the leader of a certain gunboat detachment, once commanded two gunboats and sank and damaged one Chiang bandit gunboat each in more than 30 minutes, capturing 24 Chiang bandit soldiers, creating a brilliant example of winning more with less at sea. Wang Jiajin, a second-class meritorious person and gunner of a collectively awarded third-class meritorious gunboat, established meritorious service in a fierce naval battle. At that time, in a critical situation, he stepped forward bravely, calmly directing the light weapons on the艇 to fire at the Chiang bandit gunboat, and quickly eliminated the malfunction of the cannon, damaging a Chiang bandit gunboat. Tao Baorong, a second-class meritorious person and rotating gunner, was wounded in several places on his head, waist, and thighs in a battle, but he still gritted his teeth and persisted in the battle, and finally, with his comrades, bravely damaged a Chiang bandit gunboat and repelled the attack of two Chiang bandit planes.
