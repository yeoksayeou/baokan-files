    Hubei Huanggang Special District's riverside disaster victims and fishermen have launched large-scale fishing activities. Currently, the riverbank damming and fish-trapping project has concluded, blocking off more than twenty lakes including Huangcao, Taibai, and Sanshan, covering an area of approximately 6.5 million mu. The completion of these damming projects has greatly ensured the completion of the special district's fish production plan of over 118.8 million jin. In early October, as the river water gradually receded, disaster victims and fishermen in the riverside lake areas launched fishing activities. According to statistics from nine counties including Huangmei, Qichun, and Xishui, more than 10,300 boats have already gone to the lakes to fish, with nearly 41,000 disaster victims and fishermen participating, averaging more than 258,900 jin of fish caught per day. Wang Xigui, a member of the Xinxing Fishery Production Cooperative in Luhu Township, Qichun County, even caught a large yellow croaker weighing more than 420 jin. Approximately 23,000 fishing boats are currently preparing to go to the lakes, with about 100,000 people participating. It is estimated that the total fish production in the special district this year will increase by about 50% compared to previous years.

    Yangxin, Huanggang, Huangmei, Daye, Guangji, and other counties have also established fishing movement command centers to lead the fishing activities of disaster victims and fishermen. Many counties have convened representative meetings of fishermen and disaster victims to discuss and exchange fishing methods and experiences, and to delineate fishing areas, avoiding past fishing disputes. In order to vigorously purchase and process fresh fish, the special district has also established 87 fresh fish purchasing stations and 15 fish processing factories, thus greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of disaster victims and their confidence in overcoming disasters.

    Zhejiang coastal fishermen are actively preparing to welcome the winter ribbonfish season. This winter, more than 900 newly built fishing boats will go to sea to fish, an increase of 10% compared to the same period last year, with a planned output increase of 26% compared to the same period last year. Forty-two new fishery production cooperatives, twenty-eight credit cooperatives, and three credit departments have been established in the main coastal fishing areas. After Juexi Town, Xiangshan County, established a fishery production cooperative, the number of fishing boats participating in the winter fishing season will double compared to last year. Currently, fishermen are actively repairing boats, mending nets, and formulating production plans, and it is estimated that the cooperative will have an income of about 1 billion yuan during the winter fishing season.

    The Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels in coastal Zhejiang have decided to add two temporary storm warning stations in the main fishing grounds and allocate funds to build five fishery navigation marks to ensure safe navigation. Local People's Banks are issuing large amounts of fishery loans to solve the problem of insufficient funds for fishermen to go to sea during the winter fishing season. State-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in the fishing areas have also prepared a large amount of production and living materials such as rice, cooking oil, fishing nets, and ramie for the fishermen.

    湖北省黄冈专区沿江灾民和渔民努力捕鱼
    浙江省渔民积极准备迎接冬季渔汛
    湖北省黄冈专区沿江灾民和渔民开展了大规模的捕鱼活动。目前沿江堵口下栈拦鱼工程已结束，共堵住黄草、太白、三山等二十多个湖泊，面积约计六百五十多万亩。这些堵口工程的完成，大大保证了全专区一亿一千八百多万斤产鱼计划的完成。十月上旬，江水日益下降，沿江滨湖地区灾民和渔民即开展了捕鱼活动。据黄梅、蕲春、浠水等九县的统计，已下湖进行捕鱼的船只一万零三百多只，参加捕鱼的灾民和渔民将近四万一千多人，每天平均捕到二十五万八千九百多斤鱼，蕲春县吕湖乡新兴渔业生产合作社社员王喜贵还捕到一只重达四百二十多斤的大黄鱼。现正在准备下湖的渔船约有两万三千多只，参加的人数约有十万多人。预计今年全专区产鱼比往年可增产百分之五十左右。
    阳新、黄冈、黄梅、大冶、广济等县还成立了捞捕运动指挥部，来领导灾民和渔民的捕鱼活动。不少的县召开了渔民和灾民代表会议，讨论和交流了捕鱼方法和经验，划分了捕鱼地区，避免了过去捕鱼中的纠纷。为了大力收购和加工鲜鱼，全专区还设立了鲜鱼收购站八十七个，加工鱼厂十五个，因此，大大鼓舞了灾民的生产积极性和战胜灾荒的信心。　（徐浩然）

    浙江沿海渔民积极准备迎接冬季带鱼汛。今冬将有九百多只新造渔船出海捕鱼，比去年同期增加百分之十，计划产量要比去年同期增加百分之二十六。沿海主要渔区新办了四十二个渔业生产合作社，二十八个信用合作社，三个信用部。象山县爵溪镇办了渔业生产合作社后，参加冬汛的渔船将比去年增加两倍，现在渔民们正积极修船补网，制订生产计划，预计冬汛中全社可收入十亿元左右。
    浙江沿海中共各级党委和人民政府，已决定在主要渔场增设两处临时暴风警报站，并拨款建筑渔业航标五座，以保证安全航行。当地人民银行正在发放大量渔业贷款，解决渔民冬汛出海资金不足的困难。渔区国营公司和供销合作社也为渔民准备了大量的米、食油、鱼网、络麻等生产和生活资料。  （本报浙江记者站）
