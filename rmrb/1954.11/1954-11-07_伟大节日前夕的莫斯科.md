    伟大节日前夕的莫斯科
     【新华社莫斯科六日电】伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年的节日已经临近了。这几天来，虽然初冬的寒风已开始在吹动行人的衣袂，但是莫斯科仍然保持着秋天的明媚和温暖。这个伟大的城市现在显得分外庄严美丽。处处的高楼大厦前，都有艺术家和安装工人们在忙碌着。在他们的安装下，一颗颗节日的红星升入天空，一个个庆祝的灯炬放射出光彩。莫斯科盛装起来了。
    红场是节日的中心。在国营百货公司的门前，鲜红的旗帜和苍翠的柏枝交相辉映。在整个建筑物临红场的那一面墙上，装饰着苏联和各加盟共和国的国徽、苏维埃国家的缔造者列宁和他事业的伟大继承者斯大林的画像。一幅红布上写着大字标语：“苏联人民在建设共产主义的斗争中的伟大的鼓舞力量和指导力量——苏联共产党万岁！”历史博物馆和华西里大教堂的建筑物两旁都进行了节日的装饰。红场正在等待着盛大的节日示威游行。
    高尔基街上行人熙熙攘攘。商店都延长了营业时间，橱窗里陈列的都是节日的礼品和纪念这个伟大节日的图画。中央电报局大楼今年节日装饰的主题是伟大的开垦处女地运动。大楼正面安着金色的大字：“开垦新地是全民的事业”。两旁是两万七千盏彩色的电灯照耀着的图景。人们可以在上面看到拖拉机在处女地上行驶，泥土向两旁翻开；一忽儿图景上又变成麦田的景色，微风在摇动着麦穗，联合机在进行收割。……大楼两侧的巨幅红底金字标语说明今年农业战线上的各项伟大成就。
    入夜，节日的灯光照耀着起义广场新建的大厦。这座十多层楼的白石建筑物快要落成了。大楼面前已经开辟了新的花园。在共青团广场上，另一座十多层的高楼也已全部完工。许多新的住宅出现在列宁格勒区、无产阶级区和基辅区。
    莫斯科的劳动人民在各剧院、文化宫、俱乐部举行晚会，欢庆自己的节日。他们根据苏联人的传统，在节日前总结了自己的和平劳动的成果。莫斯科有许多企业提前完成了任务，无数迎接节日竞赛的产品不断从各个工厂运出来。从莫斯科各区和苏联各地生产战线上传来的捷报，雄辩地说明了苏联人民在党和政府的领导下正全力地继续发展着重工业，急速提高日用品工业和农业的生产。节日前夕的莫斯科表达了苏联人民多方面的胜利和莫斯科人的自豪的心情。
