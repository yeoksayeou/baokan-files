Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 2nd: China's petroleum drilling technology has rapidly improved. Petroleum drilling workers are not only able to drill petroleum exploration wells, production wells, or water injection wells as deep as about 1,500 meters, but also able to drill deep exploration wells of more than 2,000 meters. Before liberation, the deepest well drilled in the Northwest region was only 999 meters, but now China has drilled several exploration wells with a depth of more than 2,000 meters, one of which has been drilled to a depth of more than 2,800 meters. The experience in drilling deep wells that China's petroleum drilling department has accumulated will make it possible to find oil in deeply buried oil-bearing structures in the future.

An important reason for the rapid improvement of China's petroleum drilling technology is the relatively comprehensive learning of the Soviet Union's experience in petroleum drilling work. This year, many drilling teams in China's major petroleum exploration areas have universally promoted the Soviet Union's rapid drilling experience, which has greatly improved drilling efficiency. The drilling team led by Zhang Guding in the Jiuquan Basin drilled 1,335.57 meters in one month in August this year; the drilling team led by Zheng Yuhu drilled 234.3 meters in one day in September. Both created new records in the history of China's petroleum drilling. If we look at the average efficiency of all drilling teams, it has also greatly improved. From January to September this year, the average drilling footage per month for one drilling rig was 52.23 meters more than last year, and the quality of the various wells drilled was mostly up to standard.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Workers in various petroleum exploration areas under the Drilling Bureau of the Petroleum Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, are implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and are striving to drill several thousand meters more for the country throughout the year and save 26 billion yuan in investment.

The drilling footage plan from January to September in each exploration area has already been overfulfilled by 4 percent. Now, in order to further achieve this goal of increasing production and practicing economy, the workers in each exploration area have strengthened the development of rationalization proposals and the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions, and are specifically preparing from aspects such as drilling technology measures, mechanical power maintenance, equipment supply, and winter well site insulation. The exploration area where the Jiuquan Drilling Office workers are located is currently a heavier petroleum drilling task area in China. The drilling teams of various drilling rig types here will continue to promote the experience of using "scraper drill bits" in a relatively loose formation. The advantage of this experience is that it can not only increase the drilling speed but also save "roller cone drill bits". The workers of the Jiuquan Drilling Office will also promote the safe drilling experience of drilling deep exploration wells with large drilling rigs under the guidance of Soviet experts, and promote the operating procedures for the use and maintenance of diesel engines. This year, they are expected to save the country 10 billion yuan in wealth. The workers of the drilling team that drilled production oil wells on an oil-bearing structure in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin are tapping potential and striving to drill a total of more than 1,800 meters more for the country throughout the year.

### 我国石油钻探技术水平迅速提高  各石油探区职工提出进一步增产节约目标

    我国石油钻探技术水平迅速提高
    各石油探区职工提出进一步增产节约目标
    【新华社西安二日电】我国石油钻探技术水平迅速提高。石油钻井工人不但已经能够钻凿深达一千五百公尺左右的石油探井、生产井或注水井，并且能够钻凿二千多公尺的深探井。解放前，在西北地区钻凿最深的一口井只有九百九十九公尺，而现在我国钻凿二千多公尺深度的探井就有好几口，其中有一口井已钻到二千八百多公尺深。我国石油钻探部门已经积累起来的钻凿深井的经验，将使得今后在埋藏得很深的储油构造里都能找出石油来。
    我国石油钻探技术水平迅速提高的重要原因，是比较全面地学习了苏联石油钻探工作的经验。今年，我国各主要石油探区的许多钻井队都普遍推广了苏联快速钻进的经验。使钻井效率提高很多。酒泉盆地张固鼎领导的钻井队，在今年八月份的一个月里就钻了一千三百三十五点五七公尺；郑毓衡领导的钻井队，九月份的一天里就钻了二百三十四点三公尺。都创造了我国石油钻井史上的新纪录。如果拿全部钻井队的平均效率来看，也大大提高了。今年一月到九月份一部钻机一个月平均的钻进尺数，要比去年多五十二点二三公尺，而且钻成的各种井，质量大都合格。
    据新华社讯：燃料工业部石油管理总局钻探局所属各石油探区的职工们，贯彻增产节约精神，正在争取全年为国家多钻进几千公尺并节约投资二百六十亿元而努力。
    各探区一月到九月的钻探进尺计划早已超额百分之四完成。现在，各探区职工为了进一步达到这个增产节约的目标，都加强了开展合理化建议和贯彻苏联专家建议的工作，并具体地从钻井技术措施、机械动力保养、器材供应和冬季井场保温等方面进行准备。酒泉钻井处职工所在的探区，是目前我国石油钻探任务较重的探区，这里的各种钻机类型的钻井队，将继续推广在一种较松软的地层中用“刮刀钻头”的经验。这个经验的好处是不但可以提高钻井速度，还可以节省“牙轮钻头”。酒泉钻井处职工还将推广经苏联专家指导的用大型钻机打深探井的安全钻井经验，推广使用和保养柴油机的操作规程。今年，他们预计可为国家节省一百亿元的财富。在陕北盆地的一个储油构造上打生产油井的钻井队的职工们，正在发掘潜力，争取全年总计为国家多钻进一千八百多公尺。
