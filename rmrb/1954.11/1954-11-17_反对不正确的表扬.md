    Oppose Incorrect Praise
    Dong Qian
    The socialist construction cause needs to rely on and develop the enthusiasm and creativity of millions of people. Extensive praise in newspapers is an important means of establishing good examples for everyone to learn from, and inspiring and encouraging the masses to build socialism with enthusiasm and creativity. However, newspapers must be good at correctly using the method of praise. If the newspaper's praise is inappropriate or incorrect, it will not only fail to establish a learning model for the masses, but will also lead the masses in the wrong direction, foster pride and complacency in those praised, and cause serious political losses to the newspaper.
    The vast majority of the examples praised by our newspapers are correct, can be used as learning models for everyone, and have played a huge role in inspiring the masses to actively participate in the socialist construction cause. However, some incorrect or even erroneous praises still appear in our newspapers from time to time, which has resulted in adverse effects. According to recent inspections of some praise reports by the editorial departments of Shenyang Daily, Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, Chongqing Daily, Zhejiang Daily and Shaanxi Peasant Daily, the following incorrect or erroneous praises have been found.
    Some fabricate facts and make something out of nothing. For example, an author named Jiang Ying from Shenjingzi Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City wrote a letter to the Shenyang Daily entitled "Song Chuan'yi Pays Off All Purchased Public Bonds at Once" (see the newspaper on April 13), which was completely fabricated. There is no such person as Song Chuan'yi in Shenjingzi District at all. Four newsletters written by Jiangsu Xinhua Daily reporter Wang Ruoyuan, including "Spring on the Sanhe Sluice Gate" (see the newspaper on April 18 last year), "Braised Fish" (see the newspaper on May 18 last year), "A Wedding on the Sanhe Sluice Gate" (see the newspaper on May 22 last year), and "On the Night of the Wheat Harvest" (see the newspaper on June 26 last year), also had some fabricated plots. Although these newsletters written by Wang Ruoyuan are not completely false reports like Jiang Ying's article, the difference is only in degree, and the error still belongs to fabrication. The characters or deeds fabricated by the author may confuse people who do not know the truth for a while, but they cannot be concealed from the masses in the area, and will create a very bad influence among the masses.
    Some are isolated and one-sided, severing history. For example, Lang Yilin (pen name Ma Lingshan), the editor of the "Commercial Briefs" of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, in his article "Salesman Luo Xiangshu" written for the Chongqing Daily (see the newspaper on July 10), only promoted Luo Xiangshu's "good performance" at a certain time in isolation, without comprehensively considering his history and character; as a result, a person who used to be a landlord and capitalist was written as being from a "poor" family, and even described as a person who had gone through hardships. Some authors learn about the "advantages" of a certain person from the surface or fragmentary plots, and then praise them in isolation and one-sidedly, and attempt to describe the object they have collected as an outstanding "typical example", thus subjectively emphasizing how advanced this person is and how backward others are, or concentrating the achievements of the surrounding masses on this person. The original purpose of newspapers praising advanced figures is to establish role models and encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, but this kind of praise that distorts objective facts can only achieve the opposite effect.
    Still others embellish and exaggerate. For example, when Zhang Huachang, an editor of the Zhejiang Daily, was compiling the news "Six Department Stores and Outlets Newly Built and Expanded in the Province This Year" (see the newspaper on September 5), he embellished it by saying that after the Xiaoshan Department Store "started business, local farmers said one after another: 'It is much more spacious to buy things at the department store.'" But in fact, according to letters from a dozen readers to the newspaper, the newly built outlet of the Xiaoshan Department Store "had not yet dried the paint" and "the ground outside the door had not yet been paved", and it had not "started business" at all. Where did the "farmers saying one after another" come from? This is just an editor who "improved" it a step further by embellishing it. This kind of embellishment, turning eight points into ten points, and exaggerating individual phenomena into overall phenomena, does not only exist among editors, but is also quite common among reporters and correspondents.
    It should be understood that the reasons for improper or erroneous praise are various. Some are because they copy from here and there, and sit back and enjoy the results. For example, Jiang Ying's article "Song Chuan'yi Pays Off All Purchased Public Bonds at Once" was copied from the article "Patriotic Elder Song Chuan'yi Pays Public Bonds in Advance" in the Liaodong Masses Daily on March 9. The newsletters "A Wedding on the Sanhe Sluice Gate," "On the Night of the Wheat Harvest," and "Braised Fish" written by Jiangsu Xinhua Daily reporter Wang Ruoyuan imitated and copied the People's Daily's "Happy Event," "Wheat Harvest Record," and Polevoi's "In the Mist." The only differences are the names, locations, times, and some specific plots. Copying from here and there and sitting back and enjoying the results is a manifestation of bourgeois individualism. For example, Jiang Ying wanted to attract public attention and fraudulently obtain manuscript fees. Wang Ruoyuan wanted to become famous and successful easily. In everyone's criticism of them, it was clearly pointed out that they were using the prestige of the Party newspaper and stealing other people's labor results as tools to display and elevate themselves. Stealing other people's labor results is a kind of exploitative behavior in which the bourgeoisie does not work and reaps the rewards. Therefore, the practice of Jiangsu Xinhua Daily and other newspaper editorial departments to educate all staff members through the criticism of bourgeois individualist ideological styles with universal significance in writing work is undoubtedly timely and correct, and should be advocated and promoted.
    Some are because they are perfunctory and irresponsible, and their work is crude. For example, in an article written by a reporter from the Shaanxi Peasant Daily entitled "Supporting National Construction is Supporting Ourselves" (see the newspaper on July 6), the role of national assistance and worker support to peasants was exaggerated to the point where the wheat yield per mu increased by more than 300 jin, accounting for more than 70% of the average yield of 410 jin per mu. And the education of calculating three accounts for the peasants after they sold their surplus grain was forcibly said to be the reason why the peasants actively sold their surplus grain, just because he perfunctorily completed the task based on fragmentary materials collected at a symposium. Perfunctory and irresponsible, and crude work are manifestations of a boastful and floating style. Like the reporter from the Shaanxi Peasant Daily, when he went to Wengjia Village for an interview, he only spent one day there, hurriedly leaving and returning, and hurriedly wrote the manuscript. He neither went deep among the masses, nor studied and checked the materials, and boasted about how he carefully calculated three accounts for the peasants. People with this kind of ideological style often float in the upper levels in their interview work, and only use ready-made materials such as work summaries and meeting reports to write news reports. Some people even regard this as a "shortcut in interview work." This is a very harmful view and practice, and must be criticized and corrected.
    Still others are because they only rely on subjective assumptions and do not check in many ways. For example, the author of the article "Salesman Luo Xiangshu," Lang Yilin, after listening to Luo Xiangshu's one-sided words and dishonest narration, did not check in many ways, and subjectively assumed that his family was "poor." Zhang Huachang, an editor of the Zhejiang Daily, also only saw the words "completed on August 5" in the original manuscript, and inferred that it would "start business" when published, so he no longer checked and arbitrarily modified it. Only relying on subjective assumptions and not checking in many ways is a manifestation of a self-righteous subjectivist style. This kind of person often speculates arbitrarily, treating superficial phenomena as the essence of things, or only relying on imagination and estimation, treating things that may happen tomorrow as today's reality. Although the self-righteous subjectivist style has been criticized many times among our newspaper staff members and is no longer a common phenomenon, there is still such a style that often acts strangely in some comrades and contributors. They often listen to only one side of the story and believe it, writing as soon as they hear it, without making systematic and thorough research; they send it as soon as they write it, without checking in many ways; the editors also do not seriously study and verify it, and publish it as soon as they edit it. Therefore, this self-righteous subjectivist style still needs to be resolutely opposed now.
    In addition to the reasons mentioned above, not being able to clearly distinguish the boundaries between the description of news newsletters and the exaggeration of literary art in terms of understanding, and not recognizing the truth that praise must be completely correct are also reasons for improper or erroneous praise. Insufficient or incorrect understanding is a matter of ideological level, while copying from here and there, being perfunctory and irresponsible, and making subjective assumptions are issues of ideological style. And these ideological styles are incompatible with the Party's style of being modest and prudent, going deep among the masses, and conducting investigation and research. Therefore, they must be criticized and corrected.
    In order to thoroughly correct these bad ideological styles, newspaper editorial departments must take active and effective measures to strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership. That is, on the one hand, to strengthen the education of ideological style for all staff members and contributors through various forms, and to carry out criticism and self-criticism regularly, so that they recognize that these bad ideological styles are not simply shortcomings or errors in work methods and writing methods, but are issues of impure Party spirit and irresponsible attitudes towards the work of Party newspapers. On the other hand, to specifically stipulate the review system and responsibility system according to the work process, to achieve layer-by-layer responsibility, and to ensure the complete correctness of newspaper praise organizationally. But in order for the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of the editorial department to truly play this role, according to the experience of some newspaper editorial departments, the leading comrades of the editorial department need to discover the bad ideological styles of cadres in a timely manner through business. In this regard, in the past, the leading comrades of some editorial departments were often only satisfied with cadres completing their work tasks, and did not ask much about how they completed them and the effect of completion; some leading comrades paid some attention to this, but always felt that it was a "small problem" and "nothing", and did not raise it to the level of Party spirit and ideological style to criticize and correct it in a timely manner. This not only promoted the development of bad ideological styles and caused unrealistic and exaggerated reports to appear in newspapers, but also hindered newspapers from playing their role as ideological weapons. This should be improved with the earnest attention of the leading comrades of the editorial department.

    反对不正确的表扬
    董谦
    建设社会主义事业需要依靠和发扬千百万群众的积极性和创造性。而在报纸上进行广泛的表扬，正是以优良的范例为大家树立学习的榜样，启发和鼓舞群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性的重要手段。但是报纸必须善于正确运用表扬的方法，如果报纸的表扬不当或者表扬错误，那就不仅不能为群众树立学习的榜样，而且会把群众引导到错误的方向，会助长被表扬者的骄傲自满情绪，还会造成报纸的严重政治损失。
    我们的报纸所表扬的范例中，绝大多数都是正确的，都是可以作为大家的学习榜样，并且在鼓舞群众积极参加社会主义建设事业方面起了巨大的作用。但在我们的报纸上还不时地出现一些不正确的甚至错误的表扬，因而产生了不良的影响。仅据近来沈阳日报、江苏新华日报、重庆日报、浙江日报和陕西农民报编辑部对一些表扬报道的检查，就发现过这样一些不正确的或错误的表扬。
    有的是虚构事实，无中生有。例如，沈阳市郊深井子村有个名叫疆嬴的作者，他写给沈阳日报的“宋传义一次缴完认购的公债款”（见四月十三日该报）来信，就完全是虚构捏造的，在深井子区根本无宋传义这个人。江苏新华日报记者王若渊所写的“三河闸上的春天”（见去年四月十八日该报）、“红烧鱼”（见去年五月十八日该报）、“三河闸上的一件婚事”（见去年五月二十二日该报）、“在麦收的夜间”（见六月二十六日该报）等四篇通讯，其中有一部分情节也是编造的。王若渊所写的这些通讯虽不像疆嬴那篇完全是假的报道，但这只是程度上的不同，其错误仍然属于虚构。被作者虚构的人物或事迹，对于不明真相的人来说，也可能迷惑一时，但对所在地区的群众来说，却是瞒哄不过的，并且会在群众中造成很坏的影响。
    有的是孤立片面，割断历史。例如，重庆市商业局“商业简讯”编辑郎益霖（笔名马陵山），在他写给重庆日报的“营业员罗祥书”（见七月十日该报）一稿中，就只是孤立地宣扬罗祥书一时“表现不错”，而没有全面地考虑他的历史和品质；结果把一个过去就是地主和资本家的人，写成出身
  “清寒”，甚至把他描述成一个历经艰难困苦的人。有些作者从表面上或者片断情节上了解到某一个人的“优点”，就孤立片面地加以表扬，并企图把自己所采写的这种对象描写为出众的“典型”，因而主观地强调这个人物如何先进，别人如何落后，或者把周围群众的成绩，也集中在这个人物的身上。报纸表扬先进人物，原是为了树立榜样，鼓舞群众的积极性和创造性，可是这种歪曲客观事实的表扬，恰恰只能得到相反的效果。
    还有的是添油加醋，夸大渲染。例如，浙江日报编辑张华昌在编写“本省今年新建扩建六个百货商店门市部”（见九月五日该报）消息时，就添油加醋地说，萧山百货商店“开始营业后，当地农民纷纷反映：‘到百货公司买东西宽敞得多了。’”但事实上，据十几位读者向该报写信反映：萧山百货商店新建的门市部“油漆未干”，“门外地面尚未铺平”，根本没有“开始营业”，哪里来的“农民纷纷反映”呢？这不过是编辑用添油加醋的办法把它“提高”了一步。这种添油加醋，把八分说成十分，把个别的现象夸张为整体的现象，并不只是在编辑人员当中存在着，就是在记者、通讯员当中也是相当普遍存在着。
    应当了解，造成表扬不当或表扬错误的原因，是各种各样的。有的是因为东抄西补，坐享其成。如投稿人疆嬴写的“宋传义一次缴完认购的公债款”，就是抄袭的三月九日辽东大众报“爱国老人宋传义提前缴纳公债款”一稿。江苏新华日报记者王若渊采写的“三河闸上的一件婚事”、“在麦收的夜间”、“红烧鱼”等通讯，则是模仿和抄袭人民日报的“喜事”、“麦收记”以及波列伏依的“雾中”。所差别的只是人名、地点、时间和某些具体情节不同。东抄西补，坐享其成，是资产阶级个人主义的一种表现。如疆嬴就是为了哗众取宠，骗取稿费。王若渊则是想轻而易举地成名成家。这在大家对他们的批判中，就都这样明确地指出，是利用党报的威信和偷窃别人的劳动成果，来作为显示个人和抬高个人的工具。而偷窃别人的劳动成果，正是资产阶级不劳而获的一种剥削行为。因此，江苏新华日报等报编辑部通过对采写工作中带有普遍意义的资产阶级个人主义思想作风的批判，来教育全体工作人员的作法，无疑是适时的正确的，应该加以提倡和推广。
    有的是因为敷衍塞责，工作粗糙。如陕西农民报一位记者采写的“支援国家建设就是支援自己”一稿（见七月六日该报），其中所以把国家扶助和工人支援农民的作用，夸大到使每亩小麦增产三百多斤，竟占每亩平均产量四百一十斤的百分之七十以上，并把在农民卖余粮后才向农民进行的算三笔账的教育，硬说成是农民积极卖余粮的原因，就是因为他只凭一次座谈会上收集的片断材料，来敷衍塞责完成任务。敷衍塞责，工作粗糙，是虚夸飘浮作风的一种表现，像陕西农民报这位记者，到翁家庄采访时，就只用了一天的时间，匆匆忙忙而去，匆匆忙忙而回，又匆匆忙忙写成稿件。他既没有深入群众，又没有研究和核对材料，就虚夸怎样给农民细算了三笔账。具有这种思想作风的人，他们在采访工作中往往是飘浮在上层，只凭工作总结、会议汇报等现成材料，来写新闻报道。有些人甚至把这看作是“采访工作中的捷径”。这是非常有害的观点和作法，必须加以批判和纠正。
    还有的是因为仅凭主观臆断，不多方查对。如“营业员罗祥书”一文的作者郎益霖在听了罗祥书片面之词和不老实的口述后，也没多方查对，便主观臆断地说他的家境“清寒”。浙江日报编辑张华昌也只是看到原稿上写有“八月五日完工”的话句，就推断在发表时一定会“开始营业”，便不再去查对，擅自加以修改。仅凭主观臆断，不多方查对，就是自以为是的主观主义作风的一种表现。这种人常常妄自推断，把表面的现象当成事物的本质，或者只凭想像估计，把明天可能发生的事情当作今天的现实。自以为是的主观主义作风在我们报纸工作人员中虽经多次批判，已不是普遍的现象，但在若干同志和投稿人当中还有这样的一种作风经常作怪。他们往往是偏听偏信，听到就写，不作系统的周密的研究；写了就寄，不多方查对；编辑人员也不认真研究核实，编出就登。因此对于这种自以为是的主观主义作风，现在仍然需要坚决反对。
    除上面说的一些原因以外，在认识上辨别不清楚新闻通讯的描写和文学艺术的夸张的界限，没有认识表扬必须完全正确的道理，也是造成表扬不当或表扬错误的原因。认识不够或认识不正确，这是限于思想水平的问题，而东抄西补、敷衍塞责和主观臆断，则是属于思想作风问题。而这些思想作风，都是同党的谦虚谨慎、深入群众、调查研究的作风不相容的，因此，必须加以批评和纠正。
    为要彻底纠正这些不良的思想作风，报纸编辑部必须采取积极有效的措施，加强思想领导和组织领导。这就是，一方面要通过各种形式，对所有工作人员和投稿人加强思想作风的教育，经常开展批评和自我批评，使他们认识这些不良的思想作风，并不简单是工作方法和写作方法上的缺点或错误，而是党性不纯的问题，是对待党报的工作不负责任的问题。另一方面，要根据工作过程，具体规定审查制度和责任制度，做到层层负责，从组织上保证报纸表扬的完全正确。但要使编辑部的思想领导和组织领导真正起到这个作用，根据一些报纸编辑部的体验，那就需要编辑部的领导同志通过业务及时发现干部的不良思想作风。在这方面，过去有些编辑部的领导同志往往只满足于干部完成工作任务，而不大过问怎样完成和完成的效果；有些领导同志虽对此有所注意，但总觉得是“小问题”、“没有什么”，也没提高到党性和思想作风上及时加以批评纠正。这不仅助长了不良思想作风的发展，使表扬失实和夸大渲染的报道在报纸上出现，并且妨碍报纸发挥作为思想武器的作用。这是应该引起编辑部领导同志切实注意改进的。
