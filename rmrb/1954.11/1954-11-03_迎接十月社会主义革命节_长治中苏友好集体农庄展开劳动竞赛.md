Xinhua News Agency Report: To welcome the 37th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the 2nd anniversary of the farm's establishment, the members of the Changzhi China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm are actively engaged in various activities.

The "China-Soviet Friendship Week" activities, scheduled to begin on November 7th, are currently being actively prepared. The entire farm will hold a grand celebration rally, and nine speakers and a large number of propagandists will deliver systematic reports to the farm members, focusing on the communique of the Sino-Soviet talks. A China-Soviet Friendship Exhibition Hall will also be established within the collective farm to display pictures and books introducing Soviet collective farms. In addition, farm members will hold separate symposiums to discuss this year's experience in learning Soviet advanced artificial insemination techniques and adopting Soviet methods of phased mating and feeding of coarse-haired pigs. As a result of learning these advanced techniques and experience, the farm's 1,747 mu of corn increased production by an average of more than 50 jin per mu this year, and more than 100,000 jin of pork were supplied to the state in batches. The symposium will also systematically summarize advanced farming methods such as deep plowing with agricultural machinery and the seed retention system, and the farm members will discuss and formulate specific measures for learning and promoting advanced Soviet agricultural production experience in the future.

In order to welcome the October Revolution Day, the ten production brigades of the entire farm launched a two-week labor competition starting from October 24th. After the farm members' intense labor, the competition goal of striving to overfulfill the autumn harvest by increasing production by 70,000 jin of grain and composting 3,000 mu of corn stalk fertilizer ahead of schedule is nearing completion. Currently, the entire farm is summarizing and awarding labor models. In the labor upsurge to welcome the festival, the tractor drivers who till the collective farm are also working in shifts day and night for autumn plowing. Wang Xinyou, the driver of the Soviet Natzi tractor, who has maintained excellent results for two years, has also joined the Red Star competition with the goal of plowing quickly, plowing well, saving fuel, and ensuring safety after completing the threshing task.

    迎接十月社会主义革命节
    长治中苏友好集体农庄展开劳动竞赛
    据新华社讯：长治中苏友好集体农庄的庄员们正积极展开各种活动，迎接十月社会主义革命三十七周年和建庄两周年。
    将在十一月七日开始的“中苏友好周”活动，目前正在积极准备中。全庄将举行盛大庆祝集会，九个报告员和大批宣传员将以中苏会谈公报为主题，向庄员们作系统报告。集体农庄内还将建立一座中苏友好展览馆，展出介绍苏联集体农庄的图片和书籍。另外，庄员们将分别举行座谈会，座谈今年学习苏联人工授粉先进技术和采用苏联毛猪分期交配和喂养的经验。学习这种先进技术和经验的结果，曾使今年农庄的一千七百四十七亩玉米平均每亩增产五十多斤，分批供给国家十万多斤猪肉。座谈会还要对农业机械深耕和留种地制度等先进耕作方法进行系统的总结，并由庄员们讨论订出今后学习和推广苏联先进农业生产经验的具体措施。
    为了迎接十月革命节，全庄十个生产大队自十月二十四日起开展了为时两周的劳动竞赛。经过庄员们的紧张劳动，争取超额完成秋收中增产七万斤粮食和提前积沤三千亩的玉米秸肥料的竞赛目标，已接近完成。现在，全庄正进行总结和评奖劳动模范。在迎接节日的劳动高潮中，替集体农庄耕作的拖拉机手们也日夜轮班进行秋耕。两年来一直保持优良成绩的苏联纳齐号拖拉机驾驶员王辛有，在完成脱谷任务后，又投入了以耕得快、耕得好、又省油、又安全为目标的红星竞赛。
