Dear fellow workers of the Ukrainian Dneprodzerzhinsk Coking Plant and the Ukrainian Zaporozhye Coking Plant:

    It has been a year since I left you, and I miss you especially during the "May Day" International Labor Day and the October Revolution Day. I think of your great friendship towards us, your patience in teaching and guiding our practice. Because of your help, we received a basic education in enterprise management. We personally experienced how important your advanced experience is to our young country, which is implementing socialist industrialization. It greatly reduced our groping process and accelerated the speed of our socialist industrial construction. After returning to China, with the help of Soviet experts, we adjusted the organizational structure of the entire plant according to the organization of the Soviet coking plant, combined with our current level of employees, and determined the staffing of the workshops. As a result, the potential of the employees was brought into play and labor productivity was improved. In terms of technical management, we revised the post operating procedures and established technical inspection and testing work; in terms of technical innovation, we introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. With the efforts of workers and technicians, the old equipment in the refined benzene workshop was converted into continuous operation, a small tower was added in the tar workshop, and the quality of the washing oil was improved, etc. Recently, a rationalization group has been established to specifically study the automation of furnace door cleaning, and some initial results have been achieved, which are currently being tested.

    The recent publication of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué fully reflects the common aspirations and common interests of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union, and fully demonstrates the strong unity and profound friendship between the two peoples. In the past few years, with the help of Soviet experts, the output of our factory has exceeded the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period, the equipment utilization rate has increased by 1.6 times, and the recovery rate of several important by-products has doubled. These achievements can only be achieved with the help of the Soviet people. Although we have overfulfilled the national plan for January to October this year, we must continue to learn from you, overcome shortcomings, and strive to ensure the completion of the annual plan for this year.

    As we celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we express our heartfelt congratulations to you and thank you for your sincere help to us. We once again express our determination to strengthen our study of the Soviet Union and implement the recommendations of Soviet experts to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the country. We wish you success in your work and good health!

    Zhou Xuancheng, Director of Anshan Iron and Steel Company Chemical Plant

    鞍钢化工总厂厂长给苏联焦化工厂的信敬爱的乌克兰第聂伯捷尔仁斯基焦化工厂和乌克兰萨波罗什焦化工厂全体职工同志：
    离开你们已一年了，每逢“五一”国际劳动节和十月革命节，我就分外地想念你们。我想起你们对我们的伟大的友谊，你们那样耐心地授课和指导我们实习的精神。因为你们的帮助，我们在企业管理方面得到了一次基础的教育。我们亲身体验到，你们的先进经验对正在实行社会主义工业化的我们年青的国家，是多么的重要。它大大减少了我们的摸索过程，加快了我们社会主义工业建设的速度。我们回国后，在苏联专家的帮助下，按照苏联焦化工厂的编制，结合我们现在的职工水平，调整了全厂的组织机构，确定了车间的定员，结果发挥了职工的潜力，提高了劳动生产率。在技术管理方面，我们修订了岗位操作规程，建立了技术检查和检验工作；在技术革新方面，我们介绍了苏联的先进经验，在工人和技术人员的努力下，把精苯车间的旧设备改成了连续式操作，在焦油车间增加了一个小塔，改进了洗涤油的质量等等。最近又成立了一个合理化小组，专门研究炉门清扫自动化问题，也初步得到了一些成绩，现正在进行试验。
    最近中苏会谈公报的发表，充分反映了中苏两国八万万人民的一致的愿望和共同利益，充分显示了两国人民的坚强团结和深厚友谊。几年来，我们的工厂在苏联专家的帮助下，产量已超过了伪满时期的最高水平，设备利用率提高了一点六倍，几种重要的副产品的回收率提高了一倍。这些成果都是在苏联人民的帮助下才能得到的。今年，我们虽然已超额完成了一到十月份的国家计划，我们还必须继续向你们学习，克服缺点，努力保证完成今年全年的计划。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年纪念日来到了，我们向你们表示衷心的祝贺，并感谢你们对我们的真诚的帮助。我们再一次表示要加强学习苏联，贯彻执行苏联专家的建议，来完成国家给我们的光荣任务。祝你们工作顺利，身体健康！
    鞍山钢铁公司化工总厂厂长　周宣城
