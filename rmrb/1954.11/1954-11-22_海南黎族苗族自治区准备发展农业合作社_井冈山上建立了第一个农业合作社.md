    Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region Prepares to Develop Agricultural Cooperatives
    First Agricultural Cooperative Established in Jinggang Mountains
    Guangdong Province's Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region plans to establish 143 agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring, 25 of which are planned to be piloted in villages inhabited by Li farmers in the Wuzhi Mountain area. Currently, more than 900 trained cadres are leading farmers of all ethnic groups in establishing cooperatives.
    Most areas of the autonomous region are revolutionary base areas. The region's more than 500,000 people of all ethnic groups are mainly engaged in agricultural production and have already completed land reform. The autonomous region currently has more than 9,200 permanent and temporary mutual aid groups, and has piloted ten agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers organized account for 53% of the total number of farm households. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The first agricultural production cooperative has been established in the Jinggang Mountains. This cooperative is the "Five Wells" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dajing Township. Recently, the agricultural production cooperative held an inaugural meeting. On this day, more than 200 farmers from various mountainous areas in Suichuan County's Jinggang Mountain area came to participate and visited all members of the cooperative household by household.
    The "Five Wells" Agricultural Production Cooperative was established by the Zou Wenkai and Zou Yungui mutual aid groups in Dajing Township. These two mutual aid groups were established in the autumn of 1951 and have achieved bumper harvests every year since. In the past three years, they have increased production by more than 34,000 catties of grain. Fifteen of the seventeen member households have moved into new houses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    海南黎族苗族自治区准备发展农业合作社
    井冈山上建立了第一个农业合作社
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治区今冬明春准备建立一百四十三个农业生产合作社，其中有二十五个准备在五指山区黎族农民聚居的乡村试办。目前九百多个经过训练的干部，正在领导各族农民建社。
    自治区大部分地区是革命根据地。全区五十多万各族人口主要从事农业生产，并早已先后完成了土地改革。自治区现有九千二百多个常年和临时互助组，并试办了十个农业生产合作社，组织起来的农民占总农户百分之五十三。（新华社）
    井冈山上成立了第一个农业生产合作社。这个合作社是大井乡的“五井”农业生产合作社。最近，这个农业生产合作社举行了成立大会，这一天，遂川县井冈山区有两百多个农民从各个山区里赶来参加，并对这个合作社的全体社员逐户地作了访问。
    “五井”农业生产合作社是由大井乡的邹文楷、邹运桂两个互助组建立起来的。这两个互助组在一九五一年秋天成立，以后每年都得到丰收，三年来共增产了三万四千多斤粮食，十七户组员中就有十五户住上了新房子。（新华社）
