    Zhejiang Province and Wenzhou City People's Courts Hold Sentencing Rally
    A Batch of Chiang Kai-shek's Traitorous Clique of Secret Agents Sentenced
    The Zhejiang Provincial People's Court and the Wenzhou City People's Court held a sentencing rally in Wenzhou City on the 3rd against a group of secret agents from Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique. Among them, the most heinous secret agents Gao Changchun, Jin Shengyuan, Yang Zhifang, Zheng Jiyao, Gao Bochao, and five others were sentenced to death. Xu Dingmei, Xu Suicun, Mao Zhengyuan, and twelve others were sentenced to life imprisonment, fixed-term imprisonment, legal supervision, and deprivation of political rights, respectively.
    More than 1,700 representatives from all walks of life in Wenzhou City attended the sentencing rally. Before the start of the sentencing rally, many people visited the evidence and photos of these counter-revolutionary elements betraying the motherland and opposing the people. Loudspeakers in various streets of Wenzhou City were crowded with people listening to the live recording of the rally.
    The principal offender of this group of counter-revolutionary criminals, Gao Changchun, fled to Dachen Island, which was occupied by Chiang's bandit troops, as early as 1949. He served as the leader of the "Yongjia Detachment of the Zhejiang Southern Column of the Zhejiang People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," a bandit organization, "Zhejiang-Fujian Liaison Commissioner," and intelligence staff officer of the "Independent 42nd Column of the Ministry of National Defense." Under the instructions of the "Dachen Station of the Secrecy Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" and the "Dachen Naval Reconnaissance Group" and other secret service agencies of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, he actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities. In December 1952, after receiving special agent training in the "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Gao Changchun was appointed as the leader of the 5602 underground group. In 1953, he sneaked into Wenzhou City with a radio transmitter, and recruited Yang Zhifang and Jin Shengyuan as telegraphers, and Mao Zhengyuan, Xu Dingmei, and others as informants, continuously sending intelligence to the secret service agencies. He also instructed counter-revolutionary elements Gao Bochao and Jin Shengyuan to secretly carry out activities under the guise of opening the "Heli Umbrella Shop"; in addition, he attempted to send counter-revolutionary element Yang Zhifang to Lishui County to establish a radio station, preparing to expand counter-revolutionary activities.
    The cracking of this group of secret agents was due to the reporting by the people of Wenzhou City and the multiple investigations by the public security organs. When the counter-revolutionary element Gao Changchun sneaked into Wenzhou City in February 1953 and hid at No. 96, Dagaogiao Xia, Xu Xandi, a worker at the Wenzhou branch of the China Tea Company, and Wang Yongcui, a family member of a worker, reported Gao Changchun's suspicious behavior to the local police station. After Gao Changchun was exposed, the counter-revolutionary criminal Jin Shengyuan fled in fear of punishment, but was captured with the help and report of his son, Jin Wenshun.

    浙江省和温州市人民法院举行宣判大会
    判决一批蒋介石卖国集团特务分子
    浙江省人民法院和温州市人民法院三日在温州市举行对一批蒋介石卖国集团特务分子的宣判大会。其中罪大恶极的特务分子高长春、金胜源、杨之芳、郑集尧、高伯超等五人被判处死刑，徐定妹、徐碎存、毛正元等十二人分别判处无期徒刑、有期徒刑、依法管制和剥夺政治权利。
    参加宣判大会的有温州市各界代表一千七百多人。在宣判大会开始以前，很多人都参观了这批反革命分子背叛祖国反对人民的罪证和照片。温州市各个街道上的广播筒前边都挤满了倾听大会实况录音的人群。
    这批反革命罪犯的主犯高长春，在一九四九年即潜逃蒋贼军盘踞的大陈岛，曾任匪“浙江人民反共救国军浙南纵队永嘉支队”支队长、“浙闽联络专员”、“国防部独立第四十二纵队”情报参谋，并在蒋介石卖国集团“国防部保密局大陈站”和“大陈海军侦察组”等特务机关指使下，积极进行反革命活动。一九五二年十二月，高犯长春在蒋介石卖国集团“国防部第二厅”受特务训练后，被委为五六零二潜伏组组长，于一九五三年携带电台一部，潜入温州市，并拉拢杨之芳、金胜源为报务员，毛正元、徐定妹等为情报员，连续向特务机关递送情报。并又指使反革命分子高伯超、金胜源以开设“合力雨伞店”为掩护秘密进行活动；另外又企图派遣反革命分子杨之芳到丽水县建立电台，准备扩大进行反革命活动。
    这批特务的破获是经过温州市人民的检举和公安机关多方侦察才破案的。当反革命分子高长春一九五三年二月潜入温州市，匿居大高桥下九十六号时，附近中国茶业公司温州支公司的工人徐宪弟和工人家属王詠翠就曾向当地派出所反映了高长春的可疑行为。当高长春被破获后，反革命罪犯金胜源即畏罪潜逃，但在他儿子金文舜检举和协助之下缉拿归案。　（新华社）
