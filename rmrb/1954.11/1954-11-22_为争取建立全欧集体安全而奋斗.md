As a member of the World Peace Council, I believe that the current struggle of the people of European countries against the revival of German militarism and for the establishment of European collective security and peace is a matter of paramount importance in the movement to defend world peace. We, the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, are very concerned about this struggle. We live on the same planet, and the peace and security that we need are closely inseparable. Only when the countries of Europe, Asia, and other continents are guaranteed security can the world have lasting peace.

Over the past year or so, the struggle to defend peace has achieved significant victories in both the East and the West.

After the cessation of the Korean War, the flames of war in Indochina were also extinguished. At the same time, China and India, as well as China and Burma, issued joint statements including the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration also reaffirmed these principles. This has pointed out a broad path for establishing collective peace and security among Asian countries and for establishing and expanding peace zones.

In late August of this year, the French National Assembly rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty, completely bankrupting the "European Army" plan that had seriously threatened European peace and security for the past two years. This is not only a victory for the French people but also a victory for the entire Europe and world peace forces.

However, although the forces of war have suffered a serious setback, they are still playing various conspiracies. Shortly after the "European Army" plan went bankrupt, Western countries, through the London and Paris conferences, put another plan for reviving German militarism and creating a new war before the European people.

The London and Paris Agreements are not substantially different from the bankrupt "European Defense Community" treaty, but they add some deceptions and make it easier for the United States to consistently pursue its policy of reviving German militarism.

No one can conceal the fact that no matter what means are used to rearm West Germany and revive German militarism, it contains infinite dangers. It will keep Germany in a long-term state of division, making it impossible for the German people to realize their long-awaited national unity. It will divide Europe into militarily opposed groups, allowing a revanchist West Germany to play a major role in the aggressive bloc, creating tension, and thus deepening the crisis of war. It will bring infinite terror and disaster to the people of Europe. This will not only seriously threaten the peace and security of European countries but also seriously threaten the peace and security of Asia and the entire world.

We, the Chinese people, fully support the struggle of the European people against the London and Paris Agreements. We believe that the people of European countries, especially the French people, like the struggle against the European Army, will certainly be able to achieve victory in the struggle against the London and Paris Agreements.

The US war bloc and its followers are stepping up their blackmail against the people of European countries, attempting to get the London and Paris Agreements approved as soon as possible. They say that only by rearming West Germany and pulling it into the Western European bloc and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will Western countries be safe; only after the London and Paris Agreements are approved can Western countries negotiate with the Soviet Union "from a position of strength." What a shameful deception. They have trotted out the old tune of the Western countries' past instigation of German fascist aggressive forces.

Will the people of Europe not forget the lessons of history? In just forty years, the two world wars in Europe both started with the rise of German militarism. We, the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, still clearly remember that the Western countries' past instigation of the rise of German and Japanese fascist aggressive forces eventually led to World War II, causing the flames of war to spread across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, resulting in incalculable losses to the people in vast areas of the world. If this practice is repeated today, the disaster it will bring to the people of the world will be even more unimaginable.

The road to guaranteeing European peace and security is now open. Earlier this year, at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet government proposed a proposal on concluding an "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security." On the 13th of this month, the Soviet government further sent notes to twenty-three European countries, as well as the United States and the People's Republic of China, regarding an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The Soviet proposal is the most realistic and reasonable step to save Europe from division and war and lead it towards peace and security. The idea of collective security is increasingly gaining the support of people from all over the world. Our Asian countries are advancing on the road to establishing collective peace and security. The Five Principles of the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Joint Declarations have been warmly welcomed by Asian countries and peoples. These five principles are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This proves that peaceful coexistence is entirely possible between countries with different socio-political systems. We believe that it is necessary and possible for Europe to take the same path and establish a collective security system that includes all European countries, large and small, with different socio-political systems.

According to the Soviet proposal, European countries can mutually undertake obligations to resolve all disputes by peaceful means and to use joint actions, including military actions, to stop any threat of aggression. In this way, the unification that the German people long for can be achieved through peaceful consultation, and the security needed by all countries, large and small, can also be guaranteed. This proposal is completely different from the Western countries' unilateral convening of the London and Paris conferences, organizing exclusive military blocs, and creating a long-term division of Germany, thereby bringing serious threats to European peace and security. It should be pointed out that in the recent discussions in the United Nations on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, the five-nation proposal indicated that the opinions of Western countries and the Soviet Union are approaching. However, Western countries, on the one hand, agree to disarmament, and on the other hand, they are arming West Germany, which is completely self-contradictory. If the people of all countries hope that universal disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction will become a reality, they should first smash all conspiracies to rearm West Germany and revive German militarism.

Western countries, including the United States, have no reason to reject the Soviet Union's sincere proposal of the 13th of this month. The people of Western countries should, for the sake of their own vital interests in peaceful life, realize that the Soviet Union's new proposal is an important contribution to their national security and their own happiness, resolutely rise up and force their governments to accept this proposal, so that the all-European conference can be held in Paris or Moscow as scheduled.

We, the Chinese people, fully support the Soviet Union's proposal to convene this historic conference. We, the Chinese people, have a responsibility to maintain world peace and security, so we sincerely welcome the Soviet invitation and are willing to send our representatives to participate in the meeting as observers and are willing to make every effort to promote the success of this meeting on all-European security.

The European people's struggle to defend European peace and security is now at a most critical juncture. We believe that the people of European countries, especially the people of France and Germany, who have the most direct interests in the current struggle, will certainly intensify their mobilization, resolutely carry out the struggle, smash the London and Paris Agreements, demand that their governments participate in the all-European conference, and strive for the success of the establishment of a European collective security system. We, the Chinese people, and the people of Asia, will certainly stand with our peace-loving brothers and sisters in Europe and fight for the common cause of our peace and security until victory.

    为争取建立全欧集体安全而奋斗
    世界和平理事会理事　蔡廷锴
    目前欧洲各国人民为反对德国军国主义复活、争取建立欧洲集体安全和和平而进行的斗争，在保卫世界和平运动中是一件头等重要的事情。我们中国人民和亚洲各国人民非常关心这个斗争。我们生活在同一个地球上，彼此所需要的和平和安全是密切不可分离的。只有当欧洲、亚洲和其他各洲的国家都得到了安全的保障，世界才会有巩固的和平。
    一年多来，保卫和平的斗争在东方和西方都取得了重要的胜利。
    朝鲜战争停止以后，印度支那的战火跟着被扑灭了。同时，中印和中缅发出了包括和平共处五项原则的联合声明，中苏联合宣言也重申了这些原则。这就为亚洲国家间建立集体和平和安全，建立和扩大和平地区，指出了广阔的道路。
    今年八月底，法国国民议会否决了“欧洲防务集团”条约，使两年来严重地威胁着欧洲和平和安全的“欧洲军”计划完全破产了。这不仅是法国人民的胜利，也是整个欧洲和世界和平力量的胜利。
    但是，战争势力虽然受到了严重挫折，它还是在玩弄着各种阴谋花样。“欧洲军”计划破产之后不久，西方国家经过伦敦和巴黎会议，又把一个复活德国军国主义、制造新战争的计划放在欧洲人民面前了。
    伦敦和巴黎协定同破产了的“欧洲防务集团”条约实质上并无不同，只是多加上一些欺骗，更方便于美国所一贯进行的复活德国军国主义的政策。
    谁也掩盖不了这样的事实：不管用什么方式来重新武装西德、复活德国军国主义，都是包含着无限的危险性。它将使德国长久处于分裂的局面，使德国人民所渴望的民族统一无法实现。它将把欧洲分成军事上对立的集团，让一个复仇主义的西德在侵略集团中扮演主要角色，制造紧张局势，从而加深战争的危机。它将带给欧洲人民以无限的恐怖和灾难。这不仅会严重威胁欧洲各国的和平和安全，也将严重威胁亚洲和整个世界的和平和安全。
    欧洲人民反对伦敦和巴黎协定的斗争，我们中国人民是完全支持的。我们相信，欧洲各国人民，特别是法国人民，像反对欧洲军的斗争一样，也一定能够在反对伦敦和巴黎协定的斗争中取得胜利。
    美国战争集团及其追随者正在对欧洲各国人民加紧进行讹诈，企图使伦敦和巴黎协定赶快得到批准。他们说：只有重新武装西德，把它拉入西欧集团和北大西洋公约组织，西方国家才会得到安全；只有把伦敦和巴黎协定批准了之后，西方国家才能在“实力的地位上”同苏联进行谈判。这是多么可耻的欺骗。他们把过去西方国家怂恿德国法西斯侵略势力的一套老调又搬出来了。
    欧洲人民不会忘记历史的教训吧？仅仅四十年间，欧洲两次大战都是从德国军国主义抬头开始的。我们中国人民和亚洲各国人民还清楚地记得，过去西方国家怂恿德国和日本法西斯侵略势力的兴起，终于导致了第二次世界大战，使战火烧遍了欧洲、亚洲、非洲和澳洲，造成了世界广大地区的人民无可估计的损失。今天如果再重复这种做法，它给予全世界人民的灾难，将更不堪设想。
    保障欧洲和平和安全的道路现在是敞开着的。今年初，柏林四国外长会议中，苏联政府曾经提出过一个关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议，本月十三日苏联政府又进一步向欧洲二十三个国家以及美国和中华人民共和国发出了关于讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议的照会。苏联这个建议是当前拯救欧洲免于分裂和战争、使它走向和平和安全的最现实的、最合理的步骤。集体安全的思想愈来愈得到世界各国人民的支持。我们亚洲国家正在建立集体和平和安全的道路上前进。中印、中缅联合声明的五项原则，得到了亚洲国家和人民的热烈欢迎。这五项原则是：互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。这证明着所有社会政治制度不同的国家和平共处是完全可能的。我们认为欧洲有必要并有可能走同样的道路，建立一个包括欧洲一切社会政治制度不同的大小国家的集体安全体系。
    根据苏联的建议，欧洲各国可以互相承担义务，用和平方式解决一切争端，用联合行动，包括军事行动在内，来制止任何侵略威胁。这样就可以通过和平协商的方式，来实现德国人民所渴望的统一，也可以保证大小各国所需要的安全。这个建议同西方国家的片面召开伦敦和巴黎会议，组织排他性的军事集团，造成德国的长期分裂，从而给欧洲的和平和安全带来严重的威胁，是截然不同的。应该指出：最近在联合国关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的讨论中，五国提案表示西方国家和苏联的意见是可以接近的。但是西方国家一方面赞同裁军，另一方面又进行武装西德，这完全是自相矛盾。各国人民如果希望普遍裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器成为事实，首先应当粉碎掉重新武装西德、复活德国军国主义的一切阴谋活动。
    西方国家，包括美国在内，对于苏联本月十三日这个真诚的建议是没有任何理由加以拒绝的。西方国家的人民应该为了自己切身的和平生活的利益，了解到苏联的新建议对于他们的国家安全和他们自己的幸福是一个重要的贡献，坚决起来要求和迫使他们的政府接受这个建议，使全欧会议能够在巴黎或在莫斯科如期举行。
    我们中国人民完全支持苏联召开这个历史性会议的建议。我们中国人民对于维护世界和平和安全负有责任，因此衷心欢迎苏联的邀请，愿意派出他们的代表以观察员身份参加会议，并愿以一切努力来促使这个有关全欧安全的会议获得成功。
    欧洲人民保卫欧洲和平和安全的斗争，现在正处在一个最紧要的关头。我们相信，欧洲各国人民，特别是在目前斗争中有着最直接利害关系的法国和德国人民，一定会加紧地动员起来，坚决地进行斗争，粉碎伦敦和巴黎协定，要求各国政府参加全欧会议，争取建立欧洲集体安全体系的成功。我们中国人民、亚洲人民一定同我们的欧洲各国的爱好和平的兄弟姊妹们站在一起，为我们的和平和安全的共同事业斗争到胜利。
