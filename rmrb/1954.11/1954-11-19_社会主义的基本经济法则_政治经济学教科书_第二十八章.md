    The Nature of Economic Laws Under the Socialist System

    As socialist relations of production replace the old bourgeois relations of production, the capitalist economic laws that manifest the relationship of man exploiting man become ineffective. The law of surplus value, the law of capitalist profit, and the basic economic law of modern capitalism all exit the stage. The general law of capitalist accumulation, the law of competition and anarchy of production, and other laws no longer function. Categories expressing capitalist relations, such as capital, surplus value, capitalist profit, production price, wage labor, and the value of labor power, etc., are no longer applicable.

    With the emergence and development of socialist relations of production, new economic laws such as the basic economic law of socialism, the law of planned (proportional) development of national economy, the law of continuous increase in labor productivity, and the law of distribution according to labor, etc., arise and begin to function on the basis of new economic conditions.

    Since commodity production is retained under the socialist system, the law of value still plays a role in the socialist economy, and the categories associated with it still exist. However, what remains of the old categories is mainly the form, and the content has been fundamentally changed. The old things are not completely abolished, but change their nature to adapt to the new things, retaining only the form; as for the new things, they do not simply eliminate the old things, but penetrate into the old things, changing their nature and functions, while using the old forms to develop and consolidate the new things. The new economic conditions formed by the victory of socialism have changed the nature of commodity production and commodity circulation and limited their scope of action. Under the socialist system, commodity production and commodity circulation exist without the participation of capitalists and serve the socialist economy. The scope of action of the law of value is strictly limited. Money, commerce, and banks are used as tools for socialist construction.

    The development of the socialist mode of production also obeys the economic laws common to all social formations, such as the law that relations of production must be suitable to the nature of the productive forces.

    Socialist economic laws express the relationship of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance among working people free from exploitation, while capitalist economic laws express the increasingly heavy exploitation of labor by capital. The effect of socialist economic laws strengthens the unity of socialist society, leads to the economic prosperity of socialist society and the increase of people's welfare, and creates conditions for a gradual transition to communism; while the effect of economic laws in bourgeois society intensifies class antagonism, leads to the impoverishment of the masses and the decay of the capitalist system, and finally leads to the demise of the capitalist system.

    Socialist economic laws, like the economic laws of any other mode of production, arise and function independently of people's will, that is, they have an objective nature. They cannot be created, formulated, transformed, or abolished by people's will.

    To deny the objective nature of socialist economic laws is to negate the science of socialist political economy, which would make it impossible for socialist society to foresee the course of events in the country's economic life, and impossible to do even the most basic economic leadership work well. Such denial means departing from Marxism and standing on the position of subjective idealism, which will inevitably lead to political adventurism and arbitrary decision-making in economic leadership practice.

    The objective nature of socialist economic laws does not mean that they function as a spontaneous force that rules people, nor does it mean that people seem powerless in the face of economic laws. To idolize economic laws in this way will inevitably lead to the position of spontaneity and spontaneism in socialist construction. This is completely hostile to Marxism-Leninism. Under socialist conditions, because private ownership of the means of production has been replaced by public ownership, the possibility of society's understanding and utilizing the laws of economic development has been greatly expanded.

    Capitalist economic laws pave the way for themselves as a blind and destructive force acting behind the backs of private commodity producers. With the transition to socialism, the anarchy of production disappears, and the economic development of society becomes planned. With the elimination of capitalism and the public ownership of the means of production, people become the masters of their own social and economic relations. After people understand the objective laws, they consciously use these laws to benefit the entire society.

    Engels pointed out that with the transition to socialism, "the laws of their own social action, which have hitherto stood opposed to them as alien laws of nature dominating them, will then be applied by men with complete understanding, and therefore dominated by them. Men's own social organization, which has hitherto stood opposed to them as if arbitrarily imposed by nature and history, will then become the result of their own free action. The objective extraneous forces that have hitherto governed history pass under the control of men themselves. Only from that time will men make their own history fully consciously; only from that time will the social causes set in motion by them have, in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by them." [1] This is where the freedom of recognized necessity lies.

    Under the capitalist system, the bourgeoisie utilizes objective economic laws to the extent that they can understand them, in order to seek their narrow class interests that conflict with the interests of the working masses. Under the socialist system, because the class interests of the proletariat are integrated with the interests of the vast majority of society, economic laws are used to benefit the masses of the people. The interests of the working class and the working people are completely in line with the objective process of social progress leading to the victory of communism. The working class and all working people have a vital interest in understanding and utilizing the laws of economic development.

    It can be seen that the objective nature of socialist economic laws lies in the fact that these laws exist independently of people's will and consciousness; they cannot be abolished or transformed according to people's will; failure to meet the requirements of these laws will inevitably lead to the collapse of the country's economic life. But socialist society can recognize these laws, master them, and use them to benefit itself.

    Socialist economic laws provide the possibility of developing and advancing the socialist economy. To turn this possibility into reality, it is necessary to learn to apply these objective economic laws with complete knowledge. The scientific understanding and correct application of objective economic laws are the basis of the economic policies of the Communist Party and socialist countries. The more fully socialist society understands economic laws, and the more accurately it reflects the requirements of these laws in its practical activities, the more smoothly it will achieve its goals.

    The Main Characteristics of the Basic Economic Law of Socialism

    Marx and Engels foresaw that under the socialist system, the purpose of planned and organized production is to meet the needs of the entire society as well as the needs of each member of society. Lenin developed this Marxist principle. In 1902, he wrote in the draft program of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party that the socialist society replacing the capitalist society is "to ensure full well-being and free all-round development for all members of society." [2] Lenin scientifically demonstrated the ways to increase the welfare of workers under the socialist system, and demonstrated the program of continuously increasing production, developing and applying high technology. Lenin thus revealed the main points of the basic economic law of socialism, which became the basis of the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet regime.

    Stalin gave a comprehensive definition of the basic economic law of socialism based on these key points.

    The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are: "to secure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques." [3]

    The basic economic law of socialism expresses the purpose of socialist production and the means to achieve this purpose.

     The purpose of production is determined by the relations of ownership of the means of production. When the bourgeoisie owns the means of production, production must be carried out to enrich the owners of capital, while the laborers, that is, the vast majority of society, are only raw materials for exploitation. The consumption of laborers is only needed by capitalism in the case of ensuring profits. Therefore, people and their needs cannot be the purpose of production here. When the means of production are owned by the working people and the exploiting classes have been eliminated, production is carried out for the benefit of the laborers, that is, for the benefit of the entire socialist society. Therefore, the fullest satisfaction of the people's growing material and cultural needs becomes the direct purpose of production.

    The purpose to which production is subject is inextricably linked to the means of ensuring that this purpose is achieved. In accordance with the purpose of socialist production—satisfying the growing needs of the laborers—the only means to achieve this purpose is the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.

    The satisfaction of residents' needs depends on the level of productive forces and the existing resources possessed by socialist society. The continuous growth of workers' needs inevitably requires the continuous expansion of production. Without the continuous upsurge of production, it is impossible to ensure the continuous growth of people's consumption. Conversely, the continuous growth of workers' needs and their purchasing power is a necessary condition for production to continue to move forward.

    Under the socialist system, the basic contradiction of capitalism, that is, the contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist private form of ownership, is eliminated. Therefore, socialism fundamentally does not have the antagonism between production and consumption. The basic economic law of socialism creates the possibility of coordinating the ever-increasing purchasing power of residents with the simultaneously growing production. Under the capitalist system, the level of consumption and purchasing power of the masses of the people is extremely low, always lagging behind production and hindering production. Therefore, the economy develops intermittently—from crisis to upsurge, and from upsurge to crisis. Socialist society, due to the continuous increase in people's consumption, will fundamentally not have the crisis of overproduction, and thus it is possible to continuously expand production.

    In socialist society, the contradiction between the level of socialist production reached in each period and the rapidly growing needs of the masses is solved by developing production, which increases the consumption of laborers, increases needs, and the increase in needs leads to the further expansion of production. Therefore, under the socialist system, the constant growth of the people's material and cultural needs is a powerful driving force for the continuous development of production.

    The necessary condition for the continuous growth of socialist production is the priority development of the departments producing the means of production, that is, developing faster than the departments producing consumer goods. The priority development of heavy industry and its heart—the machine-building industry—is the main source of development of the entire socialist national economy and a necessary condition for technological innovation. Without the priority development of heavy industry, which equips, provides machines, fuel, and electricity to all departments of the national economy, it is impossible to systematically expand the production of departments that supply residents with commodities, and it is impossible to ensure that the growing needs of laborers are met. Under the socialist system, the priority development of the production of the means of production is inextricably linked to the growth of people's consumption.

    The continuous growth of socialist production requires constant improvement of production, improvement of production methods, and continuous increase in social labor productivity. This is impossible without constantly improving the technical level of production and replacing outdated technologies with new technologies. Therefore, the development of higher techniques is the basis for the continuous growth and perfection of socialist production.

    Socialist relations of production have opened up unprecedentedly broad development space for technological innovation, while in bourgeois society, technological innovation is limited by the frame of ensuring maximum profit. The unevenness and periodic interruption of technological development are phenomena peculiar to capitalism, while the characteristic of socialism is the continuous improvement of technology in all production departments.

    The higher the technical level, the more resources socialist society has to meet the growing needs of laborers. The socialist economic system makes laborers directly concerned about the improvement of production and the wide application of advanced technology. Conversely, the people's concern for the development of socialist production is a constantly functioning factor in giving full play to the creativity of the broad masses to improve production as much as possible.

    In this way, the purpose of socialist production makes the development of production the own concern of the laborers. This is where the great source of the continuous development of the socialist economy lies.

    The basic economic law plays a decisive role in the socialist economic laws. It determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of socialist production development.

    The Basic Economic Law of Socialism and the Growth of Workers' Welfare

    The basic economic law of socialism manifests the fundamental superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The effect of the basic economic law of modern capitalism increasingly hinders the development of productive forces, increasingly impoverishes the working masses, enslaves and systematically plunders the people of backward countries and colonies, militarizes the economy, and causes bloody wars that kill millions of people. The effect of the basic economic law of socialism leads to a strong upsurge of productive forces, continuously improves the material and cultural living standards of the laborers, increasingly develops a peaceful economy, and increasingly strengthens the peaceful cooperation between peoples of all ethnic groups.

    The Soviet society expands the materials produced in the entire national economy year by year, ensuring that socialist production is continuously developed at a high speed. The industry of the Soviet Union has been developing upward on the basis of the upsurge of peaceful production.

    Compared with the level of 1929, the total industrial output in 1939 was 552 percent in the Soviet Union, 99 percent in the United States, 123 percent in the United Kingdom, and 80 percent in France. Despite the enormous damage suffered by the Soviet national economy during the war, the Soviet pre-war production level was quickly and greatly exceeded. As a result, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1953 was almost 16 times that of 1929. The industrial production of the United States stagnated from 1929 to 1939, and only increased military production and engaged in an arms race afterwards, exceeding the level of 1929 by a little more than double in 1953. The industrial production of the United Kingdom in 1953 only exceeded that of 1929 by 62 percent, and France only exceeded it by 5 percent.

    The continuous growth of socialist production is the solid material basis for continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. In socialist society, the phenomenon of extremely low consumption levels of the masses of the people peculiar to the bourgeois system is eliminated. Under the socialist system, the products created for their labor and used for the personal consumption of laborers are constantly increasing. The products created by social labor and used to expand production and meet the material and cultural needs of laborers are also increasing.

    In the Soviet Union, in accordance with the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, the actual income of residents is constantly growing, and the quantity of consumer goods purchased by residents at increasingly lower prices is constantly increasing.

    The growth of the actual income of Soviet laborers (that is, the income calculated by including price changes) per worker is as follows: workers increased more than two times in 1940 compared with 1913 (including the elimination of unemployment), and farmers increased about two and a half times; in 1952, the income of workers and staff members increased by 68 percent compared with 1940, while the income of farmers increased by about 72 percent. In 1953, the total income of workers, staff members, and farmers increased by another 13 percent compared with 1952.

    The production volume of consumer goods in Soviet large-scale industry, calculated at comparable prices, increased 6.6 times in 1940 compared with 1913, and 13 times in 1953.

    The constantly functioning factors that increase the actual income of Soviet laborers are the Soviet state's extensive free access to various cultural and living facilities, the issuance of pensions, subsidies, scholarships, and the implementation of various preferential measures, etc. There is a social insurance and social security system in the Soviet Union that capitalism cannot have.

    Socialism means the continuous improvement of the working conditions and living conditions of the masses of the people. It transforms the living facilities serving the residents from the means of enriching capitalists to the source of improving people's living standards. Capitalism is making the housing conditions of laborers increasingly worse, forcing them to live in slums, while socialism ensures that the housing conditions of residents are continuously improved. In the Soviet Union, due to the public ownership of basic urban housing and the state's large-scale housing construction, urban slums have been eliminated, and poorly equipped housing is increasingly being replaced by new, well-equipped houses.

    In bourgeois countries, medical care is a private matter, basically controlled by capitalist entrepreneurs, and mostly charged at high prices. Therefore, the broad masses of residents cannot afford to see a doctor. In the Soviet Union, a national and multi-faceted health care system has been established to ensure that residents receive various free treatments.

    Socialism provides great possibilities for improving the laborers culturally and for giving full play to the endless wisdom and talents of the people. Capitalism only educates laborers within the extremely narrow scope required by the interests of capitalist exploitation, while socialism creates conditions to increasingly fully meet the rapidly growing needs of the masses in education, culture, science, and art. Lenin said in 1918: "All the wisdom of mankind, all the creations of human genius, have been used to give a few all the benefits of technology and culture, and to rob the others of even elementary education and development. Now all the marvels of technology, all the achievements of culture, will become the property of the whole people, and never again will man's brain and human genius be used for oppression and exploitation." [4]

    The Soviet Union has adopted extensive measures in cultural construction to ensure that the people's growing cultural needs are met. These measures include implementing free education and improving technology, issuing scholarships to students, systematically expanding the network of schools, cultural and educational institutions, libraries, and clubs, and increasing the circulation of publications, etc.

    The number of people receiving various types of training in the Soviet Union increased from 8 million in 1914 to 49 million in 940 and 57 million in 1952. At the same time, the number of students in middle schools (grades 5 to 10) and secondary technical schools increased from 700,000 in 1914 to 14.8 million in 1940 and 21.4 million in 1953. The number of students in higher education increased from 117,000 in 1914 to 812,000 in 1940 and 1,562,000 in 1953. The number of teachers and lecturers in various schools and the number of child-care workers in children's institutions was more than 2 million in 1953, which is almost ten times that of 1914.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet state, relying on the basic economic law of socialism, implemented a policy of ensuring the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the masses.

    The Economic Role of Socialist Countries

    The objective economic laws that function under the socialist system are recognized and utilized by socialist countries in the practice of communist construction. The success of economic policies depends first and foremost on the correctness with which they actually reflect the requirements of economic laws.

    The nature of socialist countries is determined by the socialist economic foundation. The power of the working people led by the working class is suitable for the socialist economic system and the ownership of the means of production by the working people. The policies of modern bourgeois countries represent the interests of capitalist monopoly organizations and aim to increase their profits, while the policies of socialist countries—the countries of workers and farmers—represent the fundamental and vital interests of the laborers and receive the absolute support of the masses of the people.

    In accordance with the basic economic law of socialism, the main responsibility of socialist countries is to care about the best possible satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the masses of the people. "In domestic policy, our main concern is to continuously and increasingly improve the material welfare of the workers, collective farmers, intellectuals and all the people of the Soviet Union. It is necessary to continuously care about the welfare of the people, care about maximizing the satisfaction of their material and cultural needs, which is the law for our Party and government." [5]

    From the nature of socialist relations of production arises the new and historically unprecedented economic role of socialist countries. The Soviet state is the owner of no less than nine-tenths of the means of production in the country. Due to the public ownership of the means of production, the state can consciously apply these laws to its activities, relying on socialist economic laws, implement planned leadership over the national economy, and perform economic organization functions. Due to the private capitalist ownership of the means of production and the spontaneity of capitalist socio-economic development, bourgeois countries cannot play this role.

    Socialist countries take into account the multi-faceted needs of society and continuously develop and improve production according to these growing needs. Based on the actual conditions—domestic and international conditions—it specifies the specific tasks of economic construction at each stage and determines the direction and speed of national economic development. It not only takes into account past achievements, but also estimates future development trends, and realizes its economic organization functions on the basis of scientific foresight. Advanced social science—Marxism-Leninism—is the theoretical basis for the multi-faceted activities of socialist countries.

    The economic organization and cultural education work of the Soviet state includes all aspects of socialist social life. The Soviet state implements planned leadership and management over state-owned enterprises in all economic sectors. The state and its agencies appoint leaders of state-owned enterprises, companies, and various departments, and supervise their work. The state formulates national economic plans for the whole country: allocates material, human, and financial resources, stipulates the growth rate of social labor productivity, the scale and structure of production, the turnover of domestic and foreign trade, the prices of commodities in state-owned and cooperative commercial businesses, the wage levels of workers and staff members, etc. The Soviet state guides the economic life of collective farms, and through local Soviets, agricultural machinery stations, and agencies elected by agricultural labor unions, it leads collective farms, while taking into account the characteristics of collective farms as cooperative enterprises. The Soviet state uses all means to promote the consolidation of the alliance between the working class and the peasantry and to promote the expansion of economic ties between urban and rural areas.

    The Soviet state ensures that citizens can truly exercise their basic rights, such as the right to work, the right to education, and the right to material security in the event of loss of work ability and old age. It takes a whole set of measures to ensure that there is a rich supply of industrial products and food in the country and to greatly improve the living standards of the laborers. In line with this, the state, relying on the achievements gained in the development of heavy industry, vigorously develops agriculture, the industry producing daily necessities, and Soviet commerce.

    The Soviet state leads all cultural departments, develops national education, trains technical personnel, develops advanced science and art, and applies scientific and technological achievements to production.

    The strength of the Soviet state apparatus lies in its connection with the masses of the people. Due to the essence of the socialist system, centralized and unified state leadership should be combined with local initiative, and specific characteristics of the locality should be taken into account.

    The unity of economic work and political work is the most important principle of state leadership in the economy. "In practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They exist together and function together. Anyone who wants to separate economics and politics in our practical work, to strengthen economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, to strengthen political work at the expense of weakening economic work, will surely end up in a dead end." [6]

    The leadership and organizational force of the Soviet state is the Communist Party, which guides the activities of all state agencies and social organizations of the laborers. The Party issues instructions for the preparation of national economic plans, and formulates major measures in the national economy that are of extreme importance to the whole country. The Party, which is powerful because of its connection with the working masses, mobilizes workers, collective farmers, intellectuals to complete economic and political tasks, educates them, and raises their communist consciousness. The policies of the Communist Party and the socialist state aimed at meeting the new and mature needs of social and economic development play an extremely great progressive role.

    The socialist mode of production develops in the struggle between the new and the old, the nascent and the dying, the progressive and the backward, and in overcoming various contradictions and difficulties. These contradictions are of a non-antagonistic nature, because they are not connected with opposing class interests, and they are overcome in the process of communist construction.

    In socialist society, there are no exploiting classes, but there are still backward elements representing private ownership tendencies and habits that hinder the development of new progressive trends in the socialist economy, there are still thieves of public property, bureaucrats who ignore the needs of the people, and the capitalist remnants in people's consciousness have not yet been completely overcome. The Soviet state led by the Communist Party encourages the initiative of the laborers and supports the progressive trends in all areas of social life. The Soviet state cares to support new shoots, strengthens them, promotes the application and promotion of advanced production methods; it firmly opposes all inertia that hinders the rapid development of socialist production.

    One of the basic forms of the struggle between the old and the new under the socialist system is criticism and self-criticism, which is a powerful driving force for the development of socialist society. Criticism and self-criticism can reveal and eliminate difficulties and shortcomings in work, discover new potentials for accelerating economic development, and thus overcome the contradictions of socialist society on the basis of giving full play to the initiative of the masses of the people.

    The imperialist aggressive bloc is trying to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and is carrying out subversive activities in these countries by organizing assassinations, sabotage, and terror. The antagonistic contradiction between the Soviet Union and the imperialist aggressive forces is manifested here. The existence of the imperialist camp requires the Soviet state to vigorously strengthen the Soviet Union's economic strength and its defense forces.

    The state of workers and farmers is using the superiority of the socialist economic system, following economic laws, to move Soviet society forward along the road to communism.

    Brief Conclusion

    (1) Socialist economic laws are objective laws that are independent of people's will and consciousness. They express the relations of comradely cooperation and socialist mutual assistance among working people free from exploitation. Socialist economic laws do not function as a blind and destructive force. They are recognized and utilized by socialist society. The Communist Party and the socialist state base their economic policies on socialist economic laws.

    (2) The basic economic law of socialism determines all the main aspects and all the main processes of the development of the socialist mode of production, and determines the purpose of socialist production and the means to achieve this purpose. The main characteristics and requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are: to secure the maximum of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society, through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques.

    (3) Under the socialist system, the growth of needs (purchasing power of the masses) is the driving force of socialist production, which pushes socialist production forward. The continuous growth of socialist production is the material basis for continuously improving the people's consumption. The necessary condition for the continuous growth of socialist production is the priority development of the production of the means of production. Socialism guarantees the continuous development of advanced technology, which is necessary for the continuous growth of socialist production that increasingly fully meets the growing needs of laborers.

    (4) The actual income of laborers is continuously improved, in line with the continuous increase of the products belonging to oneself and the products belonging to society. Socialism means the continuous improvement of the working and living conditions of the people. It provides great possibilities for cultural construction, and it turns all the wealth of technology, science, and culture into the property of the whole people.

    (5) The socialist state led by the Communist Party represents the vital interests of the people, and increasingly broadly carries out its economic organization and cultural education work. The socialist mode of production develops in overcoming various contradictions and difficulties. The socialist state relies on the scientific knowledge of objective economic laws, uses these laws, and ensures that new progressive things defeat old things in all fields of the economy, so that society moves forward along the road to communism.

    社会主义的基本经济法则
    ——“政治经济学教科书”第二十八章
    社会主义制度下经济法则的性质
    由于社会主义生产关系代替了旧的资产阶级的生产关系，表现人剥削人的关系的资本主义经济法则便失去效力。剩余价值法则、资本主义利润法则、现代资本主义基本经济法则都退出舞台。资本主义积累的一般法则、竞争和生产无政府状态法则及其他法则不再发生作用。资本、剩余价值、资本利润、生产价格、雇佣劳动、劳动力价值等等表现资本主义关系的范畴已不适用。
    随着社会主义生产关系的产生和发展，在新的经济条件的基础上，社会主义基本经济法则、国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展法则、劳动生产率不断提高的法则、按劳分配法则等等新的经济法则产生并开始发生作用。
    由于社会主义制度下保留着商品生产，因此，价值法则在社会主义经济中仍起作用，与它相联系的范畴仍然存在。然而从旧范畴保留下来的主要是形式，其内容则已根本改变。旧东西并不是被废除干净，而是把自己的本性改变得与新东西相适应，仅仅保留着形式；至于新东西也不是简单地消灭旧东西，而是渗到旧东西里面去，改变旧东西的本性和职能，同时利用旧形式来发展和巩固新东西。由于社会主义胜利而形成的新的经济条件改变了商品生产和商品流通的性质，并限制它们的作用范围。在社会主义制度下，商品生产和商品流通是在没有资本家参加下存在的，是为社会主义经济服务的。价值法则的作用范围受到严格的限制。货币、商业、银行被用为社会主义建设的工具。
    社会主义生产方式的发展也服从一切社会形态所共有的经济法则，例如生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则。
    社会主义经济法则所表现的是不受剥削的工作者间的同志合作和互助的关系，而资本主义经济法则所表现的则是资本对劳动的日益加重的剥削。社会主义经济法则的作用使社会主义社会的统一日益加强，导致社会主义社会经济的繁荣和人民福利的增进，并为逐步过渡到共产主义创造条件；而资产阶级社会的经济法则的作用则使阶级对抗日益尖锐，导致群众的贫困化和资本主义制度的腐朽，最后使资本主义制度灭亡。
    社会主义的经济法则和任何别的生产方式的经济法则一样，是不以人们的意志为转移地产生和发生作用的，就是说，它们具有客观性质。它们不能为人们的意志所创造、制定、改造或废除。
    否认社会主义经济法则的客观性质，就是取消社会主义政治经济学这门科学，就会使社会主义社会没有可能预见国家经济生活中事变的进程，没有可能把哪怕是最起码的经济领导工作做好。这种否认就是脱离马克思主义站在主观唯心主义立场上，它必然会导致政治上的冒险主义，经济领导实践中的专横武断。
    社会主义经济法则的客观性质决不意味着它们是作为一种统治人们的自发力量而起作用的，决不意味着人们在经济法则面前似乎是无能为力的。这样把经济法则偶像化，必然会站到社会主义建设的自流论和自发论的立场上去。这是与马克思列宁主义完全敌对的。在社会主义条件下，由于生产资料私有制已为公有制所代替，社会认识和利用经济发展法则的可能性已大为扩大。
    资本主义经济法则是作为一种背着私人商品生产者起作用的盲目的破坏的力量而为自己开辟道路，随着向社会主义的过渡，生产无政府状态便告消失，社会的经济发展便带有计划性。随着资本主义的消灭和生产资料的公有化，人们成为自己社会经济关系的主人。人们认识了客观法则以后，完全自觉地利用这些法则来为整个社会谋福利。
    恩格斯指出，随着向社会主义的过渡，“人们自己社会行动的法则，直到现在都如同异己的、统治着人们的自然法则一样而与人们相对立，这些法则将被具有完备知识的人们应用，因而将服从他们的统治。人们的社会存在直到现在都好像是自然界和历史自上面强加在人们身上的东西一样而与人们相对立，现在则成为人们自己自由的事情。从来统治着历史的客观的异己力量，现在受着人本身的控制。只有从这时起，人们才开始完全自觉地自己创造自己的历史，只有在这个时候，人们所推动的社会原因才会在很大的程度上和愈来愈大的程度上产生他们所希望的结果”〔一〕。作为被认识了的必然性的自由就在于此。
    在资本主义制度下，资产阶级按其能够认识客观经济法则的程度，利用这些法则来谋取其与劳动群众的利益相抵触的狭隘阶级利益。在社会主义制度下，由于无产阶级的阶级利益与社会上绝大多数人的利益是融合在一起的，因此，经济法则是被用来为人民群众谋福利的。工人阶级和劳动人民的利益完全符合于导向共产主义胜利的社会向前发展的客观进程。工人阶级和全体劳动者对于认识和利用经济发展法则有着切身的利益关系。
    可见社会主义经济法则的客观性质就在于：这些法则是不以人们的意志和意识为转移而存在的；它们不能按人们的意志予以废除或改造；不满足这些法则的要求，必然会导致国家经济生活的瓦解。但是社会主义社会能够认识这些法则，掌握它们，并利用它们来为自己谋福利。
    社会主义经济法则提供了发展并推进社会主义经济的可能性。要把这种可能性变为现实，必须学会以完备的知识应用这些客观经济法则。对客观经济法则的科学认识和正确应用，是共产党和社会主义国家的经济政策的基础。社会主义社会愈是充分地认识经济法则，愈是在自己的实际活动中准确地反映这些法则的要求，它就愈能顺利地达到自己的目的。
    社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点
    马克思和恩格斯预见到，在社会主义制度下，有计划有组织的生产的目的既是满足整个社会的需要，也是满足社会每个成员的需要。列宁发展了这个马克思主义原理，一九○二年他在俄国社会民主工党的纲领草案中写道，社会主义社会代替资本主义社会是“为了保证社会的全体成员得到充分的福利和自由全面的发展”〔二〕。列宁科学地论证了在社会主义制度下增进劳动者的福利的途径，论证了不断增加生产、发展和运用高度技术的纲领。列宁从而揭示了社会主义基本经济法则的要点，这些要点成了共产党和苏维埃政权的政策的基础。
    斯大林根据这些要点对社会主义基本经济法则下了一个全面的定义。
    社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求就是：“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”〔三〕
    在社会主义基本经济法则中，表现了社会主义生产的目的和达到这个目的的手段。
    生产的目的是由生产资料所有制的关系决定的。当生产资料为资产阶级所有时，生产的进行必然是为了资本所有者发财致富，而劳动者，即社会上绝大多数人，则仅是供剥削的原料。劳动者的消费只有在保证取得利润的情形下，才对于资本主义是需要的，因此，人及其需要在这里不能是生产的目的。当生产资料为劳动人民所有，而剥削阶级已被消灭的时候，生产的进行则是为了劳动者的利益，就是说，是为了整个社会主义社会的利益的。因此，最充分地满足人们日益增长的物质和文化的需要就成为生产的直接目的。
    生产所服从的目的是与保证达到这个目的的手段不可分割地联系着的。与社会主义生产的目的——满足劳动者日益增长的需要相适应，达到这个目的的手段只能是在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善。
    居民的需要的满足决定于生产力的水平，决定于社会主义社会所拥有的现有资源。劳动者的需要的不断增长必然要求不断扩大生产。没有生产的不断高涨，要保证人民消费的不断增长是不可能的。反过来，劳动者的需要及其购买力的不断增长，又是生产得以不断前进的必要条件。
    在社会主义制度下，资本主义的基本矛盾，即生产的社会性和资本主义私人占有形式之间的矛盾消灭了。因此，社会主义根本没有生产和消费间的对抗。社会主义基本经济法则创造了可能性，使居民日益增长的购买力与同时增长着的生产协调起来。在资本主义制度下，人民群众的消费和购买力水平极低，总是落后于生产，阻碍生产，因此，经济是间歇地发展的——从危机到高涨，又从高涨到危机。而社会主义社会由于人民消费的不断增加，根本不会有生产过剩的危机，因而有可能不断扩大生产。
    在社会主义社会中，每个时期内社会主义生产达到的水平和群众迅速增长着的需要之间的矛盾，是用发展生产的方法来解决的，这使得劳动者的消费增加，使得需要增长，而需要的增长又引起生产的进一步扩大。所以在社会主义制度下，人民的物质和文化需要的经常增长是生产不断发展的强大动力。
    社会主义生产不断增长的必要条件，是生产生产资料的部门的优先发展，就是说，比出产个人消费品的部门发展得更快。重工业及其心脏——机器制造业的首先发展，是发展整个社会主义国民经济的主要泉源，是技术革新的必要条件。不优先发展以装备、机器、燃料和电力供给国民经济一切部门的重工业，就不可能有系统地扩大供给居民以商品的部门的生产，就不能保证劳动者日益增长的需要得到满足。在社会主义制度下，生产资料生产的优先发展是与人民消费的增长不可分割地联系着的。
    社会主义生产的不断增长要求经常改进生产，改善生产方法，不断提高社会劳动生产率。不经常提高生产的技术水平，不用新的技术代替陈旧的技术，这是办不到的。因此，高度技术的发展是社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的基础。
    社会主义的生产关系给技术革新开辟了前所未有的广阔发展余地，而在资产阶级社会中，技术革新是受保证最大限度利润的框子限制的。资本主义所特有的现象是技术发展上的不平衡和周期性的中断，而社会主义的特征则是技术在一切生产部门中的不断完善。
    技术水平愈高，社会主义社会就拥有更多的资源来满足劳动者日益增长的需要。社会主义经济制度使劳动者直接关心生产的提高，关心先进技术的广泛运用。反过来，人民对社会主义生产发展的关心，又是发挥广大群众尽力改进生产的创造性的经常起作用的因素。
    这样，社会主义生产的目的使得生产的发展成了劳动者自己的切身的事情。社会主义经济不断发展的伟大泉源就在于此。
    基本经济法则在社会主义经济法则中起着决定的作用。它决定着社会主义生产发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程。
    社会主义基本经济法则和劳动者的福利的增长
    社会主义基本经济法则表现着社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的根本的优越性。现代资本主义基本经济法则的作用，使生产力的发展日益受到阻碍，使劳动群众日益贫困，使落后国家和殖民地的人民受到奴役和有系统的掠夺，使经济军事化，引起残杀千百万人的流血战争。社会主义基本经济法则的作用导致生产力的强大的高涨，使劳动者的物质生活和文化生活水平不断提高，使和平经济日益发展，使各族人民间的和平合作日益加强。
    苏维埃社会年年扩大整个国民经济中所生产的物资，保证社会主义生产得到不断的高速度的发展。苏联的工业在和平生产的高涨的基础上一直向上发展。
    一九三九年的工业总产量与一九二九年水平相比较，苏联为百分之五百五十二，美国为百分之九十九，英国为百分之一百二十三，法国为百分之八十。尽管苏联国民经济在战争时期遭到巨大的破坏，苏联战前的生产水平仍是很快就被大大超过了。结果苏联工业的总产量，一九五三年几乎等于一九二九年的十六倍。美国的工业生产在一九二九年到一九三九年是停滞不前的，以后只是由于增加军事生产和进行军备竞争，一九五三年才比一九二九年水平超过一倍多一点。英国的工业生产在一九五三年比一九二九年只超过百分之六十二，法国只超过百分之五。
    社会主义生产的不断增长是不断提高苏联人民物质生活和文化生活水平的坚固物质基础。在社会主义社会中，资产阶级制度所特有的人民群众消费水平极低的现象消灭了。在社会主义制度下，为自己的劳动创造的并用于劳动者个人消费的产品不断地增加着。用社会的劳动创造的并用于扩大生产和满足劳动者的物质和文化需要的产品也在增加着。
    在苏联，与社会主义基本经济法则的要求相适应，居民的实际收入不断增长，居民按日益降低的价格购买的消费品数量不断增加。
    苏联劳动者的实际收入（即把价格变化估计在内而算出的收入），按一个工作者来说，其增长情形如下：工人一九四○年比一九一三年增加二倍多（失业的消灭估计在内），农民大约增加二倍半；一九五二年，工人和职员的收入比一九四○年增加百分之六十八，而农民的收入大约增加百分之七十二。一九五三年，工人、职员和农民的收入总数比一九五二年又增加百分之十三。
    苏联大工业中消费品的生产量，按比较价格计算，与一九一三年相比，一九四○年增加了六点六倍，而一九五三年增加了十三倍。
    使苏联劳动者实际收入增加的经常起作用的因素，是苏维埃国家广泛地使居民免费享受各种文化生活设施，发给养老金、补助金、助学金，实行各种优待办法等等。在苏联存在着资本主义所不能有的社会保险和社会保证制度。
    社会主义意味着人民群众的劳动条件和生活条件的不断改善。它把服务于居民的生活设施由资本家致富的手段变为提高人民生活水平的泉源。资本主义使劳动者的居住状况日益恶化，迫使他们住在贫民窟里，而社会主义则保证居民的居住条件得到不断的改善。在苏联，由于城市基本住宅的公有制和国家的大规模的住宅建设，城市的贫民窟消灭了，而设备简陋的住宅日益为新的设备齐全的房屋所代替。
    在资产阶级国家里，医疗是私人的事情，基本上掌握在资本主义企业家手中，多半收费很高，因此，广大居民群众是看不起病的。在苏联，建立了国家的多方面的保健制度，保证对居民实行各种免费治疗。
    社会主义为从文化上提高劳动者，为发挥人民中无穷无尽的智慧才能，提供了极大的可能性。资本主义只是使劳动者在资本主义剥削利益所需要的极狭小范围内受到教育，而社会主义则是创造条件，以日益充分地满足群众在教育、文化、科学、艺术方面迅速增长的需要。列宁在一九一八年说：“以往全部人类智慧、全部人类天才的创造，只是把技术和文化的一切财富给予一部分人，而剥夺另一部分人最必需的东西——觉醒和发展。现在一切技术奇迹、一切文化成果都成为全民的财产，而且从现在起，人类的智慧和天才永远不会变成强制手段，变成剥削手段。”〔四〕
    苏联在文化建设方面采取了广泛的措施来保证人民日益增长的文化需要得到满足，这些措施就是：实行免费教育和提高技术，发给学生助学金，有步骤地扩大学校、文化教育机关、图书馆和俱乐部网，增加出版物的发行数等等。
    在苏联受各种训练的人，从一九一四年的八百万增加到一九四○年的四千九百万，一九五二年的五千七百万。同时中学（五年级至十年级）和中等技术学校的学生数，从一九一四年的七十万增加到一九四○年的一千四百八十万，一九五三年的二千一百四十万。高等学校学生数从一九一四年的十一万七千增至一九四○年的八十一万二千，一九五三年的一百五十六万二千。各种学校的教师、讲师和儿童机关的教养员的人数一九五三年为二百多万，这几乎等于一九一四年的十倍。
    共产党和苏维埃国家依靠社会主义基本经济法则，实行了保证群众的物质生活和文化生活水平不断提高的政策。
    社会主义国家的经济作用
    在社会主义制度下起作用的客观经济法则，是被社会主义国家在共产主义建设的实践中认识和利用的。经济政策的成功，首先决定于它在实际上反映经济法则的要求的正确程度。
    社会主义国家的性质是由社会主义的经济基础决定的。工人阶级领导的劳动人民的政权是适合于社会主义的经济体系、生产资料的劳动人民所有制的。现代资产阶级国家的政策代表资本主义垄断组织的利益，其目的在增加它们的利润，而社会主义国家——工人和农民的国家的政策，则是代表劳动者的根本的切身的利益，它得到人民群众的绝对支持。
    与社会主义基本经济法则相适应，社会主义国家的主要责任是关心人民群众经常增长的需要得到最好的满足。“在国内政策方面，我们主要关心的就是不断地更加增进工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子和苏联全体人民的物质福利。必须不断地关心人民的福利、关心最大限度地满足他们的物质和文化的需要，对我们党和政府来说，这就是法律。”〔五〕
    从社会主义生产关系的性质中，产生出社会主义国家的新的、历史上空前未有的经济作用。苏维埃国家是不少于全国生产资料十分之九的生产资料的所有者。由于生产资料的公有制，国家有可能依靠社会主义经济法则，自觉地把这些法则运用于自己的活动中，对国民经济实行计划领导，执行经济组织职能。由于生产资料的私人资本主义所有制和资本主义社会经济发展的自发性，资产阶级国家是不能起这种作用的。
    社会主义国家照顾到社会的多方面的需要，并根据这些日益增长的需要不断发展和改进生产。它根据现实的条件——国内条件和国际条件，在每个阶段上规定经济建设的具体任务，定出国民经济发展的方向和速度。它不仅估计到过去的成果，而且估计到未来发展的趋势，在科学预见的基础上实现自己的经济组织职能。先进的社会科学——马克思列宁主义，是社会主义国家多方面活动的理论基础。
    苏维埃国家的经济组织和文化教育的工作，包括社会主义社会生活的各个方面。苏维埃国家对一切经济部门的国营企业实行计划领导和管理。国家及其机关任命国营企业、公司和各个部门的领导者，并监督他们的工作。国家制定全国的国民经济计划：分配物力、人力和财力，规定社会劳动生产率的增长速度、生产的规模和结构、国内外贸易的流转额、国营和合作社营商业的商品价格、工人和职员的工资水平等等。苏维埃国家指导集体农庄的经济生活，并通过地方苏维埃、农业机器站，通过农业劳动组合所选出的机关对集体农庄实行领导，同时照顾到作为合作企业的集体农庄的特点。苏维埃国家用一切办法促进工人阶级同农民的联盟的巩固，促进城市和乡村间的经济联系的扩大。
    苏维埃国家保证公民能真正行使其基本的权利，如劳动权利，受教育的权利，丧失劳动能力和年老的时候获得物质保证的权利。它采取整套的措施来保证国内有丰富的工业品和食品，并大大提高劳动者的生活水平。与此相适应，国家依靠重工业发展上所获得的成就，大力发展农业、生产日用品的工业和苏维埃商业。
    苏维埃国家领导着一切文化部门，发展国民教育，培养技术人才，发展先进的科学和艺术，把科学技术成就运用于生产中。
    苏维埃国家机构的力量在于它与人民群众的联系。由于社会主义制度的本质，集中统一的国家领导应与地方上的主动性结合起来，应具体地照顾到地方的特点。
    经济工作和政治工作的统一，是国家领导经济的最重要的原则。“在实践上，政治和经济是分不开的。它们一同存在，一同起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以减弱政治工作为代价来加强经济工作，或者相反地，以减弱经济工作为代价来加强政治工作，谁就一定会陷入绝境。”〔六〕
    苏维埃国家的领导和组织的力量是共产党，它指导着一切国家机关和劳动者的社会团体的活动。党发出编制国民经济计划的指示，拟定对全国有极重要意义的国民经济方面的重大措施。由于自己同劳动群众的联系而有力量的党，动员工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子完成经济政治任务，教育他们，提高他们的共产主义觉悟。共产党和社会主义国家旨在满足社会经济发展的新的成熟了的需要的政策，起着极伟大的进步的作用。
    社会主义的生产方式是在新的与旧的、新生的与垂死的、进步的与落后的之间的斗争中，在克服各种矛盾和困难中发展的。这些矛盾具有非对抗的性质，因为它们不是与对立的阶级利益联系着的，它们是在共产主义建设的进程中得到克服的。
    在社会主义社会里，没有剥削阶级，但还存在着代表私有制倾向和习惯的、阻碍社会主义经济中新的进步趋势发展的落后分子，还存在着公共财产的盗窃者、忽视人民需要的官僚主义分子，还没有完全克服人们意识中的资本主义残余。共产党所领导的苏维埃国家鼓励劳动者的主动性，对社会生活一切领域中的进步趋势给予支持。苏维埃国家关心地支持新的幼芽，加强它们，促进先进生产方法的应用和推广；它坚决反对妨碍社会主义生产迅速发展的一切惰力。
    社会主义制度下的新旧斗争的基本形式之一是批评和自我批评，它是社会主义社会发展的强大动力。批评和自我批评可以在发挥人民群众的积极性的基础上揭露和消灭工作中的困难和缺点，发现加速经济发展的新的潜力，从而克服社会主义社会的矛盾。
    帝国主义的侵略集团力图发动反对苏联和各人民民主国家的战争，用组织暗害、破坏和恐怖的办法来在这些国家进行颠覆活动。苏联和帝国主义侵略势力之间的对抗性矛盾就表现在这里。帝国主义阵营的存在要求苏维埃国家大力加强苏联的经济实力和它的国防力量。
    工人和农民的国家正利用社会主义经济体系的优越性，遵循着经济法则，使苏维埃社会沿着共产主义道路向前发展。
    简短的结论
      （一）社会主义经济法则是不以人们的意志和意识为转移的客观法则。它们表现着不受剥削的工作者的同志合作和社会主义互助的关系。社会主义经济法则不是作为一种盲目的破坏的力量而起作用，它们被社会主义社会认识和利用。共产党和社会主义国家在自己的经济政策中是以社会主义经济法则为出发点的。
    （二）社会主义基本经济法则决定着社会主义生产方式发展的一切主要方面和一切主要过程，决定着社会主义生产的目的和达到这一目的的手段。社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求是：用在高度技术基础上使生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
      （三）在社会主义制度下，需要（群众的购买力）的增长是社会主义生产的动力，它把社会主义生产向前推进。社会主义生产的不断增长是不断提高人民消费的物质基础。社会主义生产不断增长的必要条件是生产资料生产的优先发展。社会主义保证先进技术得到不断的发展，这种发展是愈来愈充分地满足劳动者日益增长的需要的社会主义生产不断增长所必需的。
    （四）与归自己的产品和归社会的产品的经常增加相适应，劳动者的实际收入得到不断的提高。社会主义意味着人们的劳动条件和生活条件的经常改善。它为文化建设提供极大的可能，它把技术、科学、文化的一切财富变成全民的财产。
    （五）共产党所领导的社会主义国家代表着人民的切身利益，日益广泛地展开自己的经济组织和文化教育的工作。社会主义生产方式是在克服各种矛盾和困难中发展的。社会主义国家依靠客观经济法则的科学知识，利用这些法则，保证新的进步的东西在经济的一切领域内战胜旧的东西，使社会沿着共产主义道路向前发展。
