    The Current Urgent Task of Basic Construction Workers

    With only forty-odd days left until the end of the year, this period should be particularly valuable for the construction units of various industrial basic construction projects. We must strengthen our work in all aspects and strive to complete the 1954 basic construction plan more and better.

    We repeatedly make such requests because the successful completion of the 1954 industrial basic construction plan will not only affect the progress of the project this year, but also affect the arrangement of basic construction work in 1955, and also affect whether the basic tasks of my country's first five-year plan can be successfully completed.

    According to the basic tasks and major indicators of my country's first five-year plan, which have been basically determined, the workload of industrial basic construction is increasing year by year, and the speed of annual growth is also very fast. This is a normal law of development. However, the actual workload of industrial basic construction that we completed in 1953 accounted for only a little more than 12 percent of the total workload of the five years; if the 1954 industrial basic construction plan is fully completed, it will only account for 15 percent of the total workload of the five years; The actual amount in 1953 and the estimated amount in 1954, plus the preliminary calculation of the workload in 1955, the total amount of the three years together will not reach 50 percent of the total workload of the five years. These percentages collectively illustrate one problem: our industrial basic construction tasks are very tight, and 1955 will be the most tense year. Therefore, it must be emphasized that each basic construction unit should complete its annual plan and strive to over fulfill the plan. If the 1954 plan is not completed, and many carry-over projects are added to the workload of 1955, this will make the already very tight basic construction task of 1955 even more tense. If the 1955 plan is not completed, then the implementation of the industrial basic construction tasks in the five-year plan will be in great danger, and it will delay the progress of my country's socialist industrialization, which will be a serious harm to my country's socialist construction cause.

    There are some people who think that the task is too tight and cannot be completed, so it is better to cut the plan early. It should be pointed out that this is a very incorrect and dangerous idea. Yes, we emphasized starting from reality in basic construction in 1953, and mainly opposed the blind and rash advance tendency in the basic construction plan, which was completely in line with the actual situation at the time. But at present, after the basic tasks and main indicators of the five-year plan have been determined, as long as these main indicators are not rash and are based on and reliable, then the fundamental question is not whether the plan can be cut, but how to use the greatest effort to ensure the realization of this plan. Attempts and practices to cut the plan are equivalent to undermining the plan and cannot be tolerated.

    The idea that the 1954 industrial basic construction plan can be completed or not completed is essentially one of the reasons why the plans of many industrial basic construction units are not well completed. For example, the third quarter of each year is the best season for construction, and generally speaking, more work should and can be completed; however, the basic construction plans of the six central industrial ministries and the railway, transportation, postal and telecommunications, forestry, and water conservancy departments in the third quarter of 1954 were not completed well, averaging only about 73 percent of the quarterly plan. Among them, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Water Conservancy did not reach 60 percent of the quarterly plan; The average amount of work completed by these eleven ministries in the third quarter was less than one-fourth of the annual plan (in the third quarter of 1953, these eleven departments actually completed more than 29 percent of the annual plan). As a result, the above-mentioned eleven departments averaged only 60 percent of the annual plan from January to September 1954, and about half of the key projects did not reach 60 percent, and individual construction units only completed about 10 percent of the annual plan. Can the above situation be completely attributed to objective reasons?

    On the one hand, because the completion of the 1954 basic construction plan has a huge impact on 1955 and the five-year plan, and on the other hand, because the basic construction plan in the third quarter of 1954 was not completed well, more than 40 percent of the workload must be completed in the fourth quarter. Therefore, it is necessary to require each industrial basic construction unit to seize the time, strengthen all aspects of the work, and strive for every possibility to complete the 1954 basic construction plan more and better.

    But precisely on this issue, some working cadres and even responsible cadres hold another idea. They think: "There is not much time left, and the conditions are not very good. It is no use catching up. We have to work harder next year to make up for this year's shortcomings." This idea is not based on facts. The workers who built the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have already proved with facts that as long as correct measures are taken, the suggestions of Soviet experts are implemented, and winter construction is implemented, not only will this year's task be successfully completed, but also the engineering work for 1955 can be started.

    According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we should make full use of the winter time for construction. In the mild climate zone of southern my country, winter construction has no impact at all; even in the cold climate of the north, as long as preparations are made, the quality and speed of construction can be guaranteed. The winter construction experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1953 fully confirmed this. Of course, the advanced experience of this kind of winter construction may encounter some difficulties if it is universally promoted in the north. Therefore, the policy of focusing on promotion this year is adopted. All basic construction units with certain conditions, especially key engineering units, should implement winter construction. In this way, we will have more time to use, we can strive to complete the 1954 basic construction plan more, and reduce the workload of carry-over projects to a minimum.

    Not only should each industrial basic construction unit be required to seize every hour to complete the 1954 basic construction plan more, but also it should be required to prepare for the basic construction in 1955, and prepare the necessary drawings, materials, equipment, etc. as soon as possible. For the units that will start construction in 1955, this kind of preparation is even more important, and we must never hold the lucky mentality of "talking about it next year", so as to avoid digging a well only when one is thirsty, delaying the start of construction and postponing the progress of the project.

    Seizing the time, strengthening all aspects of work, completing the 1954 basic construction plan more and better, and preparing for the basic construction in 1955 should be the most urgent task of all basic construction units. We must strive for every possibility to complete this urgent but glorious task.

### 基本建设职工当前的迫切任务

    基本建设职工当前的迫切任务
    现在离开年底只剩四十多天的时间，这一段时间，对各个工业基本建设的施工单位说来，应该是特别宝贵的，必须加强各方面的工作，争取更多地更好地完成一九五四年的基本建设计划。
    我们再三地提出这样的要求，是因为一九五四年工业基本建设计划完成得好坏，不仅影响本年度的工程进度，而且影响一九五五年基本建设工作的安排，也影响到我国第一个五年计划的基本任务能不能顺利完成。
    根据已经基本确定的我国第一个五年计划的基本任务和各项重要指标，工业基本建设的工作量是逐年加大的，每年增长的速度也很快。这是正常的发展规律。而一九五三年我们实际完成的工业基本建设的工作量，不过占五年总工作量的百分之十二多一点；一九五四年的工业基本建设计划如果全部完成了，也不过占五年总工作量的百分之十五；一九五三年的实际和一九五四年的预计，加上现在初步计算的一九五五年的工作量，三年合计在一起也还达不到五年总工作量的百分之五十。这些百分比集中地说明了这样一个问题：我们工业基本建设的任务是十分紧张的，而一九五五年将是最紧张的一年。因此必须强调每个基本建设单位都应该完成它当年的计划，并且要争取超额完成计划。如果一九五四年的计划完不成，留下许多结转工程增加到一九五五年的工作量中间去，这样就要使已经十分紧张的一九五五年的基本建设任务更加紧张。如果一九五五年完不成计划，那么，五年计划中工业基本建设任务的执行就会发生极大的危险，就会拖延我国社会主义工业化的进度，这对我国社会主义建设事业是严重的危害。
    有这样一些人，他们认为任务太紧张了，完不成，不如早点削减计划。应该指出，这是非常不正确的一种想法，也是很危险的一种想法。是的，我们在一九五三年开始，曾经强调基本建设要量力而行，并且主要地反对了基本建设计划中的盲目冒进倾向，这是完全合乎当时的实际情况的。但在目前，当五年计划的基本任务和各项主要指标已经确定下来以后，只要这些主要指标不是冒进的，有根据和可靠的，那么，根本的问题就不是可不可以削减计划的问题，而是如何用最大的努力去保证这个计划的实现。削减计划的企图和作法，就等于破坏计划，是不能容许的。
    认为一九五四年工业基本建设计划可完成可不完成的想法，实质上也是目前许多工业基本建设单位计划完成得不好的一个原因。例如，每年的第三季度是施工最好的季节，一般地说，应该而且可以完成更多的工作量；但一九五四年第三季度中央六个工业部以及铁道、交通、邮电、林业、水利等部门的基本建设计划都完成得很不好，平均只完成季度计划的百分之七十三左右，其中第二机械工业部、铁道部、水利部都没有达到季度计划的百分之六十；这十一个部在第三季度平均完成的工作量，尚不足年计划的四分之一（一九五三年第三季度这十一个部门实际完成全年计划百分之二十九以上）。这样，就使上述十一个部门平均在一九五四年一至九月份只完成全年计划的百分之六十，而且约有一小半的重点工程还达不到百分之六十，个别的工程单位只完成年计划百分之十左右。上述情况，难道可以完全归咎于客观原因吗？
    一方面因为一九五四年基本建设计划的完成与否对一九五五年和五年计划有巨大的影响，另一方面也因为一九五四年第三季度基本建设计划完成得很不好，必须在第四季度完成百分之四十以上的工作量。因此就必须要求每个工业基本建设单位，抓紧时间，加强各个方面的工作，争取每一个可能，更多地更好地完成一九五四年的基本建设计划。
    但恰恰在这个问题上，有一些工作干部甚至是负责干部抱着另一种想法。他们认为：“时间已经不多，条件也不怎么好，再抓紧也没有办法，只好明年再努力补今年的不足吧。”这种想法是没有根据的。建设第一汽车制造厂的职工们，已经用事实证明了：只要采取正确的措施，实行苏联专家的建议，实行冬季施工，就不但能够胜利地完成今年的任务，并且还能够开始进行一九五五年度的工程。
    根据苏联先进的经验，应该充分利用冬季的时间进行施工。在我国南方气候温和的地带，冬季施工完全没有影响；即在气候寒冷的北方，只要准备得好，同样可以保证工程的质量和施工速度。一九五三年鞍山钢铁公司冬季施工的经验完全证实了这一点。当然，这种冬季施工的先进经验，要在北方普遍推行，可能会遇到一些困难，因此，今年采取重点推行的方针。凡是有一定条件的基本建设单位，特别是重点工程的单位，都应该实行冬季施工。这样，我们就有更多的时间可以利用，可以争取更多地完成一九五四年的基本建设计划，把结转工程的工作量减少到最低限度。
    不仅应该要求每个工业基本建设单位争取每一小时来更多地完成一九五四年的基本建设计划，而且还应该要求为一九五五年的基本建设做好准备工作，早日预备好必需的图纸、材料、设备等等。对于一九五五年新开始施工的单位来说，这种准备工作更加重要，绝不能抱着“明年再说”的侥幸心理，以免临渴掘井，拖延开工的时间，推迟工程的进度。
    争取时间，加强各方面的工作，更多地更好地完成一九五四年基本建设计划，并为一九五五年基本建设做好准备工作，应该是所有基本建设单位全体职工当前最迫切的任务。我们要争取一切可能来完成这个紧迫的但是光荣的任务。
