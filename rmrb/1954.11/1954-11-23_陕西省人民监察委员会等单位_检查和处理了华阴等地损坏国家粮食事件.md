    Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee and Other Units
    Investigated and Handled Cases of Damaged State Grain in Huayin and Other Places
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the incident of "Staff members of Huayin and other county railway stations and grain agencies lacking a sense of responsibility, damaging more than 300,000 catties of grain" on August 30th, we successively received letters from Liu Renmin, a soldier from a certain unit of the North China Military Region, Liu Tianqi and Han Weiqi from Gu'an County, Hebei, Caoyuan from Hohhot, Yang Jiming from Wangcheng County, Hunan, and all employees of the Grain Bureau of Heishan County, Liaoning. They unanimously requested relevant authorities to severely punish those who neglected their duties. The following is the handling of this incident.
    The incident of staff members of Huayin and other counties in Shaanxi Province lacking a sense of responsibility and damaging grain was initially exposed by the Xi'an "Masses Daily" on July 10th under the title "The Fate of State Grain." After the exposure, the Party and government leading organs of Shaanxi Province attached great importance to it. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, in coordination with the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial Grain Bureau, the Transportation Department, the Procuratorate, and the Xi'an Railway Transportation Branch, formed three inspection teams. With the help of Party and government organs at all levels in Weinan Prefecture, from July 16th to 29th, they conducted a comprehensive and in-depth investigation of the incident in Huayin, Dali, and various railway stations, and dealt with the relevant derelict personnel separately. The Weinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed the incident and instructed the Party Group of the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department to notify relevant units in their subordinate counties to study the article "The Fate of State Grain" and conducted inspections.
    The results of the investigation by the investigation team were basically consistent with the facts revealed in this newspaper on August 30th. In the grain transported through the five stations of Baqiao, Weinan, Huayin, Xiaying, and Huaxian and the grain stored in the Huayin County Town Purchasing and Marketing Station, a total of more than 1.34 million catties were wet, deteriorated, and moldy. The causes of the accident, in addition to the fact that individual units did have difficulties such as a shortage of personnel and a lack of material conditions, were mainly due to the weak sense of responsibility of the leaders and relevant personnel of Huayin, Huaxian, Baqiao, and other stations and the grain departments of Huayin and other counties, who turned a blind eye to the wetting and molding of state grain (the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Grain Section should also bear some responsibility), causing undue losses to state grain. An Pandou, the station chief of Huaxian Station, simply wanted to compress the vehicle stop time and continue to win the May Red Banner of Excellence. Without considering it, he unloaded four cars of corn from Baqiao under the eaves of the platform at the station. At that time, he did not lay sleepers as required to prevent moisture, nor did he immediately notify the Huaxian Grain Section to collect it. As a result, it rained heavily, wetting 141,000 catties of corn, of which 41,000 catties were severely wet, and 100 catties each sprouted and scattered. In May, Zhang Qingzai, the head of the Dali County Grain Section, subjectively believed that there was a small amount of glutinous rice and many vehicles, so it would be no problem to take them as they arrived. However, he did not expect that it was the summer harvest season, and a large number of vehicles were needed, especially with more rain in summer. He did not prepare for rain prevention in his mind, so 150 bags of the 240,000 catties of glutinous rice transferred from Zhouzhi to Dali in May were wet, of which more than 779 catties were moldy and deteriorated. For example, on February 12 this year, Huayin Station unloaded more than 2.6 million catties of rice transported from Changsha to Huayin on the ground without laying sleepers or covering it, resulting in snow melting and wetting and dry and wet bags mixed together, totaling 5,171 bags being wet. On June 3 this year, the station unloaded 300,000 catties of rice transported from Qishan to Chaoyi on the lowest depression on the south side of the railway for convenience, without taking moisture prevention measures. That night, it rained heavily, and the rice stack was submerged in five inches of accumulated water, causing 230 bags of rice to get wet. The next morning, Wang Wenxuan, the station chief on duty (acting station chief), and others discovered that the grain was soaked in water, but did not immediately notify the Huayin County Grain Section to collect it or mobilize all employees to rescue it. Niu Lvzhong, deputy section chief of the Huayin County Grain Section, also arrived at the scene, but did not actively take rescue measures. More seriously, Niu Lvzhong went back to check and found that the rice should be received by the Chaoyi Grain Section, and believed that it "was none of his business," and did not carry out any rescue. For example, Yu Deshui, the station chief on duty at Baqiao Station, failed to report the vehicle requisition plan, and the grain sections of the three counties (Huaxian, Huayin, Lantian) did not lay sleepers for moisture prevention or cover the grain on the station with tarpaulins, causing 120 bags of peas from Lantian County and 132 bags of corn from Huaxian and Huayin counties to be wetted by rain. Fifty-four bags of grain in the above three counties had partially sprouted. These facts fully demonstrate that some staff members of Huayin and other stations and grain departments lack a high degree of cherishing state grain.
    In order to strengthen the cherishing of state grain and improve the sense of responsibility of all staff members of stations and grain departments, and to educate other state organ staff members, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee has convened a meeting of responsible comrades from relevant units, deciding to give An Pandou, the station chief of Huaxian Station, an administrative demotion, and Yu Deshui, the station chief on duty at Baqiao Station, a demerit; Niu Lvzhong, the deputy section chief of the Huayin County Grain Section, and Wang Wenxuan, the station chief on duty at Huayin Station, were given administrative warnings. Li Weibin, the business clerk of Huayin Station, should also be held responsible for the three grain wetting incidents at Huayin Station, and it was decided to give him a demerit. Wang Lixing, the person in charge of storage and transportation of the Huayin County Grain Section, was the direct handler of the three grain transfers at Huayin Station. He was responsible for the grain wetting accident because he did not inspect the work of the warehouse and station, but his problem had been dealt with administratively in conjunction with other problems, and he will not be punished this time. In addition, Zhang Qingzai, the head of the Dali County Grain Section, and other relevant personnel were ordered to make written self-criticisms. The Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Grain Section has made a written self-criticism and put forward improvement measures such as strengthening ideological education for cadres and strengthening contact with railway departments in the future. Through this incident, the staff members of other subordinate grain departments and relevant stations have also improved their ideological understanding and expressed their willingness to do a good job in the storage and loading and unloading of state grain.

    陕西省人民监察委员会等单位
    检查和处理了华阴等地损坏国家粮食事件
    编者按：本报八月三十日发表了“华阴等县火车站和粮食机关人员缺乏责任心，损坏了三十多万斤粮食”的事件以后，先后收到华北军区某部战士刘仁民、河北固安县刘天启和韩维祺、呼和浩特市草原、湖南望城县杨继明和辽宁黑山县粮食局全体职工的来信，他们一致要求有关机关对失职人员严肃处理。下面是这一事件的处理情况。
    陕西省华阴等县火车站和粮食机关人员缺乏责任心，损坏粮食的事件，最初是由西安“群众日报”于七月十日以“国家粮食的遭遇”为题揭发的。揭发以后，陕西省党、政领导机关极为重视。陕西省人民监察委员会协同中共陕西省委纪律检查委员会、省粮食厅、交通厅、检察署、西安铁路运输分局等单位，组成三个检查组，在渭南专区各级党政机关的帮助下，从七月十六日到二十九日分别到华阴、大荔和铁路各站对这一事件进行了全面和深入的调查，并对有关失职人员分别作了处理。中共渭南地委会对这一事件进行了讨论，责成中共渭南专署党组和地委宣传部通知所属各县有关单位学习“国家粮食的遭遇”一文，并进行了检查。
    调查组调查的结果和本报八月三十日所揭露的事实基本相符。在灞桥、渭南、华阴、下营、华县五个车站所调运的粮食和华阴县城购销站所存的粮食中，水湿、变质和霉坏的共计一百三十四万多斤。造成事故的原因，除个别单位确有人少、物质条件缺乏等困难外，主要是华阴、华县、灞桥等车站和华阴等县粮食部门的领导和有关人员责任心不强，对国家粮食湿损和霉坏熟视无睹（渭南专署粮食科也应负一定责任），致使国家粮食遭受了不应有的损失。华县车站站长安攀斗，就是单纯为了争取压缩车辆停留时间，继续获得五月份优胜红旗，而不加考虑把从灞桥运到华县的四车玉米卸在站台的房檐下，当时没按照规定铺垫枕木，以防潮湿，也没立即通知华县粮食科领取，结果下大雨，水湿了玉米十四万一千斤，其中水湿比较严重的有四万一千斤，发芽和摔撒的各一百斤。五月份，大荔县粮食科科长张庆哉主观认为糯米数量少，车辆多，随到随拿没问题，但没有想到当时正是夏收时节，大量需用车辆，特别是夏季雨多，思想上不作防雨准备，因而使五月份由盩厔调到大荔的二十四万斤糯米，有一百五十包受湿，其中霉坏变质的有七百七十九斤多。又如华阴车站于今年二月十二日把从长沙运去华阴的二百六十多万斤大米卸在地上不垫枕木，也不覆盖，致雪后溶湿及倒包中干湿不分，共水湿了五千一百七十一包。今年六月三日，该站因图方便，又把从岐山运到朝邑的三十万斤大米卸在铁路南边最低凹处，没有作防湿工作，当晚下大雨，大米垛有五寸泡在积水里，使二百三十包大米受湿。第二天早晨，该站值班站长王文轩（代理站长职务）等，发现粮食被水浸湿后，也不立即通知华阴县粮食科领取或动员全体职工抢救。华阴县粮食科副科长牛履中，虽也到了现场，但没积极采取抢救措施，更严重的是牛履中回去查明这项大米应由朝邑粮食科接收，就认为“事不关己”，再没进行抢救。再如灞桥车站值班站长于得水因漏报要车计划，而三个县（华县、华阴、蓝田）的粮食科对上站的部分粮食没垫枕木防湿和覆盖篷布，致使蓝田县的一百二十包豌豆和华县、华阴县的一百三十二包玉米被雨淋湿。上述三个县的粮食中已有五十四包部分生芽。这些事实完全说明了华阴等车站和粮食部门的一些工作人员对国家粮食缺乏高度的爱护精神。
    为了加强车站和粮食部门所有工作人员对国家粮食的爱护，提高责任心，并教育其他国家机关工作人员，陕西省人民监察委员会已召开有关单位负责同志会议，决定给华县车站站长安攀斗以行政上降职处分，给灞桥车站值班站长于得水记过处分；给华阴县粮食科副科长牛履中、华阴车站值班站长王文轩以行政上警告处分。华阴车站商务办事员李维斌对华阴车站三次粮食湿损也应负责任，决定给以记过处分。华阴县粮食科储运负责人王力行，是华阴车站三次调运粮食的直接经办人，因不检查库、站工作，对粮食湿损事故有责任，但他的问题已结合其他问题在行政上作过处理，这次不予处分。此外，并责令大荔县粮食科科长张庆哉和其他有关人员作书面检讨。渭南专署粮食科已作了书面检讨，并提出了今后要加强对干部的思想教育，加强同铁路部门的联系等改进办法。其他所属粮食部门和有关车站的工作人员通过这次事件，也提高了思想认识，都表示要做好国家粮食保管和粮食装卸等工作。
