    Shandong Province Universally Delineates Afforestation Zones and Collects Tree Seeds
    Shandong Province has universally carried out pilot work on forestry zone delineation in mountainous areas. Currently, the four special districts of Jiaozhou, Laiyang, Zibo, and Tai'an have completed the forestry zone delineation of one district or one township. The four special districts of Linyi, Changwei, Wendeng, and Jining are in the process of doing so.
    In order to do this work well, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry made arrangements at the provincial forestry conference in July. Laiwu, Yiyuan, Qixia, and other counties also established county, district, and township three-level forestry zone delineation committees to specifically lead this work. Wendeng and Laiyang special commissioner's offices organized rural economic zone delineation groups to comprehensively conduct rural economic zone delineation, dividing economic crop areas suitable for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry according to the natural conditions of the mountains, so as to enable agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to develop in a balanced and proportional manner. Zhaike Township in Rizhao County, based on the natural conditions of the mountains, divided 2,000 mu of suitable afforestation land into: 1,000 mu for economic forest areas (Chinese tallow tree, Eucommia ulmoides, fruit trees, mulberry trees, etc.), 500 mu for water source protection forest areas, and 500 mu for timber forest areas, with 28,000 trees planted in open spaces. The masses in the township also formulated annual plans for afforestation, seedling cultivation, and tree seed collection, planning to complete all construction from this winter to 1957. (Wang Lin)
    In order to prepare sufficient tree seeds for future afforestation and seedling cultivation, Shandong Province plans to collect more than 1.3 million jin of large-grained tree seeds and more than 700,000 jin of small-grained tree seeds this autumn. In addition to making specific arrangements at the provincial forestry work conference, the province also organized two working groups to go deep into the key seed-producing mountainous areas of Linyi and Tai'an special districts to assist in organizing the masses to collect seeds.
    At present, tree seed collection work has been widely carried out in various places. The Linyi Special District has collected 60,000 jin of acorns and 80,000 jin of tree seeds such as black pine, oriental arborvitae, Ailanthus altissima, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The Tai'an Special District, only in the three counties of Tai'an, Xintai, and Laiwu, has collected more than 40,000 jin of acorns and Ailanthus altissima. Linqu County has also collected more than 16,000 jin of various tree seeds. (Li Xianzhen)

    山东省普遍划分造林区并采集树种
    山东省山区普遍进行了营林区划的试点工作。目前，胶州、莱阳、淄博、泰安四专区均已完成了一个区或一个乡的营林区划，临沂、昌潍、文登、济宁四专区正在进行中。
    为了做好这个工作，山东省农林厅在七月全省林业会议上作了布置，莱芜、沂源、栖霞等县还成立了县、区、乡三级营林区划委员会，具体领导这一工作，文登、莱阳两专署组织了农村经济区划小组，全面的进行农村经济区划，根据山地自然条件划分了宜农、宜林、宜牧等经济作物区，以便使农林牧能够平衡的按比例发展。日照县宅科乡根据山地自然条件，将二千亩宜林地划分为：营造经济林区（乌桕、杜仲、果树、蚕桑等）一千亩，水源防护林区五百亩，用材林区五百亩，隙地植树二万八千株。该乡群众并制订了年度造林、育苗和采树种的计划，计划自今冬开始至一九五七年全部营造完成。（王林）
    山东省为给今后造林、育苗准备充足的树种，计划今年秋季采集大粒树种一百三十多万斤，小粒树种七十多万斤。该省除在全省林业工作会议上作了具体布置外，还组织了两个工作组深入临沂、泰安专区的重点产种山区协助组织群众采种。
    目前各地采集树种工作已广泛开展，临沂专区已采集橡子六万斤，黑松、侧柏、臭椿、洋槐等树种八万斤；泰安专区仅泰安、新泰、莱芜三县即采集了橡子、臭椿等四万余斤；临朐县也采集了各种树种一万六千多斤。　　（李宪臻）
