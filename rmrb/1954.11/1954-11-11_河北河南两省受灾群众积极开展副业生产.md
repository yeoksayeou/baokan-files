The disaster-stricken areas of Hebei and Henan provinces have actively developed sideline production.

Hebei Province has achieved remarkable results in sideline production in disaster areas. According to incomplete statistics from Tianjin, Baoding, Cangxian and other regions, more than 980,000 people are engaged in more than 40 kinds of sideline production activities such as fishing and mat weaving. In the Tianjin area, the daily income from fishing can maintain the minimum living standards of 300,000 people, and disaster victims participating in mat weaving can earn more than 270 million yuan per day. In Baoding area, about 70% of the disaster victims in Xiong County and Anxin County participated in sideline production, among which the daily income of disaster victims in Anxin County can maintain the lives of 130,000 people. In order to save food during the famine, many areas have also launched campaigns to collect grass seeds and wild vegetables. The Tongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qige Village, Hejian County, with 140 households, saves 2,300 jin of grain per month by eating some wild vegetables every day. Since the eleventh district of Wuqiang County launched a savings campaign in September, the daily supply of grain has been reduced by more than 7,000 jin.

In order to help disaster victims carry out sideline production, local state-owned commercial, grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives actively purchase sideline products from disaster victims and supply production and living materials. From October 12th to 19th, Tianjin, Baoding and other four regions transferred more than 4.3 million tons of grain and more than 140,000 tons of coal to the disaster areas in one week. The Cangxian area supply and marketing cooperative dispatched cadres to Qingdao, Xuzhou and other eight cities to purchase raw materials for production and find sales channels for products for disaster victims. The raw materials they purchased and the sales contracts they signed can supply more than 8,000 disaster victims with two months of production, allowing them to earn more than 1.47 billion yuan. Thanks to the strong support of the state and the active development of sideline production by disaster victims, not only has the difficulty of living for disaster victims been solved, but also many houses have been repaired and newly built. More than 18,000 houses have been repaired and newly built in Xiong County, Anxin, Xushui and other counties. In Guzhuang Village, Xiong County, 150 disaster-stricken households were displaced due to the collapse of their houses, and 143 households have now returned to their hometowns to resume production.

The sideline production movement in the disaster areas of Henan Province has gradually unfolded. The eighth district of Suiping County has organized more than 5,000 disaster victims to participate in sideline production such as mat weaving, fishing, and firewood collection, earning more than 110 million yuan in one month. The Jianwan Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huaibin County, in addition to taking care of agricultural production, also extracted 50 laborers to fish, and drove 70% of the disaster victims in the township to participate in sideline production. Many areas also use wasteland and open space to plant vegetables and collect sweet potato leaves for self-rescue. Huaiyang, Yancheng, Lin颍 and other counties have reclaimed more than 12,000 mu of wasteland and planted rapeseed. Disaster victims in Dongming, Zhongmu, Qixian, Xingyang and other five counties have collected more than 180,000 jin of sweet potato leaves and other substitute foods, and the Qiaogou District of Huaibin County has also collected 72,000 jin of dried vegetables and plans to collect more than 400,000 jin of sweet potato leaves and other substitute foods. This will save a batch of grain to overcome the famine.

    河北河南两省受灾群众积极开展副业生产
    河北省灾区副业生产已获得显著成绩。据天津、保定、沧县等专区不完全统计，已有九十八万多人从事捕鱼、编席等四十多种副业生产活动。天津专区每天捕鱼收入可维持三十万人的最低生活，参加编席的灾民每日可收入二亿七千多万元。保定专区雄县和安新两县百分之七十左右的灾民参加了副业生产，其中安新县灾民每天收益可维持十三万人的生活。为了节约渡荒，许多地区还开展了打集草籽、野菜运动。河间县齐各村同心农业生产合作社一百四十户人家，每天掺吃些野菜，一个月可节约粮食二千三百斤，武强县十一区自九月份开展节约运动以来，每天减少供应粮七千余斤。
    为了帮助灾民进行副业生产，各地国营商业、粮食部门和供销合作社积极收购灾民的副业产品，供应生产、生活资料。天津、保定等四个专区从十月十二日至十九日一周内就调往灾区粮食四百三十多万吨，煤炭十四万多吨。沧县专区供销合作社抽派干部分头到青岛、徐州等八个城市，为灾民采购生产原料和寻找产品销路。他们所采办的原料和订立的销售合同，可供八千多灾民生产两个月，可使灾民获利十四亿七千多万元。由于国家的大力支持和灾民积极开展副业生产，不仅解决了灾民生活的困难，还修补和新盖了许多房屋。雄县、安新、徐水等县已修补和新盖了一万八千多间房屋。雄县古庄村曾因房屋倒塌有一百五十户灾民转移他乡，现已回乡生产的有一百四十三户。
　　（徐力之）河南省灾区副业生产运动已逐步展开。遂平县八区已组织五千多灾民参加编席、打鱼、打柴等副业生产，一个月就收入了一亿一千多万元。淮滨县建湾乡农业生产合作社除了照顾农业生产外，还抽出了五十个劳动力打鱼，并带动了全乡百分之七十的灾民参加副业生产。还有不少地区利用荒地、空地栽种蔬菜，和采集红薯叶等来生产自救。淮阳、郾城、临颍等县已开垦荒地一万二千多亩，并种了油菜，东明、中牟、杞县、荥阳等五县灾民采集了十八万多斤红薯叶等代食品，淮滨县桥沟区也采干菜七万二千多斤，并计划再采红薯叶等代食品四十多万斤。这样即可节约一批粮食渡过灾荒。
