    Henan Farmers Begin Winter Agricultural Production

    The broad masses of farmers in Henan Province are currently engaged in winter agricultural production activities such as winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and wheat field management.

    Counties like Anyang, Linxian, Tangyin, and Puyang have held meetings of cadres and model workers at the district level to study winter agricultural production work. Driven by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, farmers in various regions have formulated production plans and invested in winter production. In the Xinxiang region, counties such as Jiyuan, Jixian, Huixian, Fengqiu, and Changyuan have a total of over 1.3 million mu of land for winter plowing, of which more than 540,000 mu have been plowed, accounting for more than 40% of the area to be plowed. Advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams mostly use new-style walking plows for plowing, which improves the quality of cultivation. The Liyuan Guo Qihua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changyuan County uses walking plows for all winter plowing, with a depth of about seven inches.

    Many regions have also launched winter fertilizer accumulation work. Liu Lin Township in the tenth district of Tangyin County plans to accumulate 25,000 dan of smoked fertilizer and apply 4,000 to 4,500 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu to 21,000 mu of winter wheat. They have already cut more than 60,000 jin of grass and put forward the slogan "Compare manure heaps this year, compare harvests next year." In order to promote the healthy growth of wheat, farmers in areas with water conservancy conditions are actively carrying out winter irrigation. In Wuzhi County, more than 40,000 mu of ridged fields have been prepared in the 70,000 mu of irrigated wheat fields in twenty-one townships. Topdressing, weeding, harrowing, and rolling of wheat fields are underway in various places. According to incomplete statistics from Xiuwu, Mi County and other places, 29,000 mu of wheat have been harrowed, 9,000 mu have been topdressed, and more than 2,300 mu have been rolled. Other agricultural infrastructure construction work, such as repairing ditches, ponds, building wells, and afforestation, has also begun. (Wang Haiqing)

    河南省农民开始进行冬季农业生产
    河南省广大农民，现正进行冬耕、积肥及麦田管理等冬季农业生产工作。
    安阳、林县、汤阴、濮阳等县都以区为单位召开了干部、劳动模范等会议，研究了冬季农业生产工作。各地在农业生产合作社、互助组的带动下，广大农民制订生产计划，投入了冬季生产。新乡专区济源、汲县、辉县、封邱、长垣等县，共冬耕地一百三十多万亩，已耕五十四万多亩，占应耕面积百分之四十以上。先进的农业生产合作社、互助组多使用新式步犁耕地，提高了耕作质量。长垣县梨园郭启华农业生产合作社冬耕地全部使用步犁，深耕七寸左右。
    不少地区并开展了冬季积肥工作。汤阴县十区刘林乡计划熏肥二万五千担，在二万一千亩冬小麦中，每亩普施追肥四千至四千五百斤，现已割草六万多斤，并提出“今年大家比粪堆、明年大家比收成”的口号。为了促使小麦发育健壮，有水利条件地区的农民正积极进行扒畦冬浇。武陟县二十一个乡七万多亩水地麦田，已扒好畦四万多亩。麦田施追肥、锄麦、耙麦、碾麦工作，各地都有活动，据修武、密县等地不完全统计，已耙麦二万九千亩，追肥九千亩，碾麦二千三百多亩。其他整修沟渠、塘堰、打井、造林等农业基本建设工作也已开始行动。　（王海清）
