Public medical institutions in Hangzhou have hired TCM doctors to participate in their work. Since the establishment of the TCM and acupuncture departments at the Hangzhou Publicly Funded Medical Prevention Center Outpatient Department, clinical observations of over a thousand cases have shown that TCM and Chinese medicine are significantly effective in treating neurasthenia, muscle and joint rheumatism, habitual headaches, facial nerve palsy, and various types of neuralgia. In order to study the properties of Chinese medicine, the Hangzhou Publicly Funded Medical Prevention Center Outpatient Department has also established a Chinese medicine dispensing section, with dedicated personnel responsible for decocting and purchasing Chinese medicine. Acupuncture doctors are specially invited to participate in treatment at the Zhejiang Hangzhou Sanatorium. Based on long-term clinical observations of over a hundred cases, acupuncture therapy has significant effects on diseases where general medicine is less effective, such as neurasthenia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and muscle and joint rheumatism. The sanatorium's specially invited acupuncture doctor is also researching the use of acupuncture therapy to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, proving that it can alleviate symptoms, stimulate the patient's appetite, increase weight, and promote early recovery of health. Larger hospitals such as the Hangzhou First Hospital have begun to establish connections with TCM, inviting famous TCM doctors to conduct consultations on difficult and complicated cases. Currently, the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Health Bureau is actively preparing to establish a TCM outpatient department, and the Hangzhou First and Second Hospitals are preparing to establish TCM departments, hiring famous TCM doctors to participate in treatment work.

Over 280 people attended, including professors, lecturers, assistant teachers from the college's internal medicine and surgery departments, as well as Western medicine doctors from Hunan Provincial Hospital and Changsha Municipal Hospital.

Since the communication of the resolutions of the National Higher Medical Education Conference in August this year, the teaching staff and physicians of Hunan Medical College have initially recognized the great value of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as the importance of learning TCM and organizing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Many people have requested to understand the history of traditional Chinese medicine and to study and research the medical principles and treatment methods of TCM. Therefore, the pharmacology teaching and research group of the college specially invited Director Li Congfu to give this special report. This report will be completed in three sessions. In the future, the college will continue to invite TCM doctors to give reports on TCM medical principles and drug treatments. (Our newspaper's Hunan reporter station)
