    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 26th: TASS, Jakarta, November 25th: Indonesian newspapers are paying close attention to the West Irian issue. "Merdeka," "Indonesia Torch," "Indonesian News," and other newspapers, when discussing the upcoming UN discussion on the West Irian issue, emphasize that West Irian must be immediately returned to Indonesia because West Irian is Indonesian territory.
    Indonesian Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Tambunan, stated in a statement published in the newspaper: "The return of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia is a national demand."
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 28th: The Indonesian newspaper "Merdeka" published an editorial on the 27th stating that Western countries, which appear neutral on the surface but actually side with the Netherlands, should seriously consider the Indonesian Foreign Minister's remarks about returning West Irian to Indonesia.
    "Merdeka" refutes the Western countries' argument that white people bring "progress" to the colonies. It says that the evils brought to Indonesia by the Netherlands' three hundred and fifty years of rule can be used as a yardstick to measure whether the Netherlands will bring "prosperity" to West Irian. The newspaper emphasizes that Indonesia has made great progress in education and production without Dutch aid since its independence and has established diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with other countries.
    "Merdeka" says that Indonesia wants to change the situation in West Irian and is confident that it has the ability to accomplish this task.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 28th: The Indonesian Central Organization of All Trade Unions called on the 27th to strengthen national unity and strive for the return of West Irian to Indonesia. In a statement, the Central Bureau of the General Federation of Trade Unions stated that West Irian is a matter of national interest, which is a matter of concern to the whole country, not just the workers. Therefore, workers are considering taking broader action with other sectors of society.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 26th: TASS, Jakarta, November 25th: Deputy Speaker of Parliament and leader of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, Katawena, called on the people to strengthen the consistency of their actions for West Irian. He said: "We must achieve the closest possible cooperation between the Communist Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Islamic Party in this country." Katawena denounced the subversive activities carried out by traitors and colonial countries that are hostile to the Republic. He urged the people to be vigilant against the activities of the American New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company and the Dutch Royal Shell Oil Company, which earn hundreds of millions of guilders from Indonesia every year. Katawena emphasized the fact that the Indonesian people have the right to nationalize these companies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 26th: TASS, Jakarta, November 25th: According to Antara News Agency, an uprising against the Dutch occupiers has broken out in Sorong, West Irian. The Dutch authorities have deployed troops in the area. Aircraft are also participating in suppressing the people's actions.

    印度尼西亚舆论要求立即归还西伊里安
    西伊里安的梭弄爆发了反对荷兰占领者的起义
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社雅加达二十五日讯：印度尼西亚的报纸密切注意西伊里安问题。“独立报”、“印度尼西亚火炬报”、“印度尼西亚新闻”以及其他报纸都在论述联合国即将讨论西伊里安问题一事时着重指出，西伊里安必须立即归还印度尼西亚，因为西伊里安是印度尼西亚的领土。
    印度尼西亚国会副议长谭布兰在报纸上发表的声明指出：“西伊里安归还印度尼西亚共和国是民族的要求。”
    【新华社雅加达二十八日电】印度尼西亚“独立报”二十七日发表社论说，表面上以中立姿态出现而实际上和荷兰站在一边的西方国家，应该认真考虑印度尼西亚外交部长关于把西伊里安归还给印度尼西亚的谈话。
    “独立报”驳斥西方国家所谓白种人给殖民地带来“进步”的论调。它说，荷兰的三百五十年统治给印度尼西亚带来的恶果，可以作为衡量荷兰是否会给西伊里安带来“繁荣”的标尺。报纸强调指出：印度尼西亚独立后在没有荷兰援助的情况下在教育和生产方面都有了很大的进展，并且和其他国家建立了外交、经济和文化的关系。
    “独立报”说，印度尼西亚要改变西伊里安的状况，并深信自己有能力来完成这项任务。
    【新华社雅加达二十八日电】印度尼西亚总工会二十七日号召加强民族团结，争取西伊里安归还印度尼西亚。总工会中央局在一项文告中说，西伊里安是关系到民族利益的问题，这是全国，而不仅只是工人所关心的问题。因此，工人们正在考虑同其他的各界人士一起采取更广泛的行动。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社雅加达二十五日讯：国会副议长、印度尼西亚回教联盟党领袖卡塔韦纳塔号召人民为了西伊里安而加强行动的一致性。他说：“我们必须在这个国家的共产党、民族主义政党和回教政党之间尽可能取得最密切的合作。”卡塔韦纳塔斥责卖国贼和敌视这个共和国的殖民国家所进行的颠覆活动。他敦促人民对美国新泽西—纽约美孚油公司和荷兰皇家壳牌石油公司的活动提高警惕，这些公司每年从印度尼西亚赚去成亿盾的金钱，卡塔韦纳塔强调这个事实：印度尼西亚人民有权把这些公司收归国有。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社雅加达二十五日讯：据安塔拉通讯社消息，西伊里安的梭弄已经爆发了反对荷兰占领者的起义。荷兰当局已在这个地区调集了军队。飞机也参加镇压人民的行动。
