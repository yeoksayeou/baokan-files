Workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
Exceed October Construction Plan

    Building on the basis of exceeding the September construction tasks, the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have again completed the October tasks ahead of schedule and beyond the quota. As of October 25, they had completed 101.5% of the monthly plan. The workload of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in October accounted for 15.4% of the annual plan, and many of the projects laid the foundation for winter construction. Therefore, this month was crucial to ensuring the completion of the annual plan. In completing the October tasks, various work areas, factories, and stations actively launched labor competitions, which powerfully promoted the progress of the project. The sixth team of the fifth squadron of the 106th work area exceeded the new quota (doubled the old quota) by 382.9% in the backfilling work. The fourth team also exceeded the quota by 204%. Wang Hetian, the captain of the fifth team, created a tool for scrubbing foamed cement boards, exceeding the task by 191%. After accepting the task of installing wooden floors in living rooms, the Li Shufen team of the 103rd work area created the "prefabrication method" - they joined three floorboards together and prefabricated them into one piece with asphalt, which enabled the floor installation work to exceed the quota by 52% and complete the task two days ahead of schedule. The Jiang Zhaochun team of the 106th work area created a drilling method, which increased the drilling efficiency of the cornice board middle block by more than five times. Xue Yungao, a youth shock worker in the 108th work area, used the sideways and two-handed bricklaying method to create a record of laying an average of 4,388 bricks per day.

    At the critical moment of the October project, the local party committee organized more than 25,000 people to participate in voluntary labor, which played a certain role in completing the October construction plan ahead of schedule and beyond the quota.

    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工
    超额完成十月份施工计划
    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工，在超额完成九月份施工任务的基础上，又提前和超额完成了十月份的任务。到十月二十五日止，他们已完成月度计划的百分之一百零一点五。第一汽车制造厂十月份的工作量占全年计划的百分之十五点四，其中许多项目是为冬季施工打基础，因此这一个月是保证完成全年计划的关键。在完成十月份任务当中，各工区、厂、站积极展开劳动竞赛，有力地推动了工程的进展。一零六工区五中队六小队，在回填土工作中，超过新定额（比旧定额增加一倍）百分之三百八十二点九。四小队也超额完成百分之二百零四。五小队队长王和田创造了刷洗泡沫水泥板的工具，以百分之一百九十一超额完成了任务。一零三工区李树芬小组在接受了生活间镶木地板任务后，创造了“预制操作法”——他们把三块地板并在一起，用沥青预制成一块，使镶地板的工作超过定额百分之五十二，提前两天完成任务。一零六工区蒋兆春小组创造了钻眼法，提高檐口板中坎钻眼效率五倍多。一零八工区青年突击手薛云高运用侧身和双手砌墙法，创造了一天平均砌四千三百八十八块砖的最高纪录。
    在十月份工程紧张的关头，当地党委组织了两万五千多人参加义务劳动，对提前和超额完成十月份施工计划起了一定作用。
