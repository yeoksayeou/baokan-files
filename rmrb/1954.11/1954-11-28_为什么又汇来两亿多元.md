    Why Were Another Two Hundred Million Yuan Remitted?
    A letter from Binglin of the Longshan Mine Pharmaceutical Factory in Changping County, Hebei Province: In April and May of last year, the Central and Southern Branch of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration signed a batch of commodity contracts with our factory. The payment for the goods was 510 million yuan, which was paid in two installments by the Beijing purchasing group of the Central and Southern Branch at that time. In June of last year, our factory received another 255 million yuan from the Central and Southern Branch. We contacted them and the Beijing purchasing group of the Central and Southern Branch, but strangely, no one knew which unit remitted the money. We had to trace it through the bank and found out that the money was remitted from Changsha, Hunan by the Supply and Sales Department of the Central and Southern Branch. We notified the Beijing purchasing group of this situation, and only received a reply this October, saying that "due to insufficient internal communication in our department, the payment was made again. Please remit it back to our department as soon as possible to settle the outstanding account."
    This double-paid payment, after continuous tracking by the receiving unit, surprisingly took more than a year to be clarified. This shows that the chaos in the financial work of the Central and Southern Branch of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration is serious. And from their reply, it seems that they have not taken this double payment incident as an opportunity to examine and improve their work, which is even more unacceptable.

### 为什么又汇来两亿多元

    为什么又汇来两亿多元
    河北省昌平县龙山矿药厂炳麟来信：去年四、五月间，有色金属工业管理局中南分局和我厂订立了一批商品合同。货款五亿一千万元，当时就由中南分局北京采购组分两次付清。去年六月，我厂又收到中南分局寄来二亿五千五百万元的货款。我们先后向他们和中南分局北京采购组联系，但使人奇怪的是谁也不知道这笔款项是那个单位寄出的。我们只得通过银行追查，才知道款子是中南分局供销处从湖南长沙汇出的。我们把这个情况通知北京采购组，今年十月才得到复信，说是“因我处内部联系不够，所以重付，特函请速汇我处以结悬帐”。
    这笔重付的货款经过收款单位的不断追查，居然还过了一年多的时间才查清楚，这说明有色金属工业管理局中南分局财务工作中的混乱情况是严重的。而从他们的复信看，他们并没有通过这次重付货款的事件来检查和改进工作，这更是不应该的。
