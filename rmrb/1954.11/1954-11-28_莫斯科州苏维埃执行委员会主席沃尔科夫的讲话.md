Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th (TASS):

    Comrades! The working people of Moscow City and Oblast express their deep sorrow over the passing of the outstanding statesman and social activist, Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky.

    The name of Comrade Vyshinsky is well-known in our country and throughout the world.

    The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and our people deeply admired his outstanding contributions to the socialist motherland.

    In any position assigned to him by the Party, Comrade Vyshinsky devoted all his strength, knowledge, and talent to faithfully serving his beloved Soviet people.

    We have lost a staunch fighter who fought to implement the Party's and the Soviet government's policy of strengthening the power of the democratic and socialist camp, strengthening friendship between peoples, and consolidating world peace.

    While holding responsible positions in the Soviet government and in the education sector, Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky contributed his abundant energy to the development of national education, culture, and science, and to the training of Soviet intellectuals.

    Comrade Vyshinsky spent many years working in Moscow.

    As early as the first years of the Soviet regime, when he served as the President and professor of Moscow State University, Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky earned the respect and praise of Soviet students and all progressive scientists in the capital through his fruitful activities.

    The working people of Moscow City and Oblast know that Comrade Vyshinsky was an active social activist, a passionate propagandist of Marxist-Leninist ideas, and that he delivered vivid scientific and political reports in various halls of the capital.

    Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky was always respected and trusted by the people. In 1921 and 1922, the workers of Moscow elected Comrade Vyshinsky as a representative to the Moscow Soviet of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies. From 1947 until his death, he was a representative to the Moscow Soviet of Working People's Deputies and actively participated in the work of the Soviet.

    The bright image of Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky will forever be remembered in the hearts of the working people of Moscow City and Oblast.

    同志们！莫斯科市和州的劳动人民对杰出的政治家和社会活动家安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基的逝世表示深切的悲痛。
    维辛斯基同志的名字，在我们国内和全世界都是人们所熟知的。
    共产党、苏联政府和我国人民都极其推崇他对社会主义祖国的杰出贡献。
    维辛斯基同志在党指派给他的任何一个岗位上，都是拿出自己全部的力量、知识和才能为自己亲爱的苏联人民忠心耿耿地服务。
    我们失掉了一位坚贞不屈地为贯彻党和苏联政府的目的在于加强民主和社会主义阵营的威力，加强各国人民之间的友谊，和巩固世界和平的政策而斗争的战士。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基在苏联政府和教育部门担任负责工作时，将他自己充沛的精力贡献给发展国民教育，文化和科学的工作，贡献给培养苏维埃知识分子干部的工作。
    维辛斯基同志一生中，有许多年是在莫斯科工作的。
    早在苏维埃政权的最初几年中，当他担任国立莫斯科大学校长兼教授的职务时，由于安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基的卓有成果的活动，他就赢得了苏联学生和首都的全体进步科学家们的尊敬和称誉。
    莫斯科市和莫斯科州的劳动人民知道，维辛斯基同志是一个积极的社会活动家，是一个马克思—列宁主义思想的热烈宣传家，他曾在首都的各个礼堂中作过生动的科学报告和政治报告。
    安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基一直很受人民的尊敬和信任。一九二一年和一九二二年，莫斯科工人曾选举维辛斯基同志为莫斯科工农兵代表苏维埃中的代表。从一九四七年到他逝世时为止，他是莫斯科劳动人民代表苏维埃中的代表，并且曾积极参加苏维埃的工作。
    莫斯科市和莫斯科州的劳动人民的心中将永远记得安德烈·扬努阿里耶维奇·维辛斯基的光辉形象。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电）
