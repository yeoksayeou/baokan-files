Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 21st: According to Delhi newspapers, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a special weekly program on the BBC on the evening of the 19th, said in response to reporters' questions that the basis of his talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing in October was peace. Prime Minister Nehru said that he firmly believed that the Chinese people adhered to the principles of peaceful coexistence.

Regarding the reporter's question, "Do you think that Chinese leaders not only believe that peaceful coexistence with friendly neighbors is possible, but also peaceful coexistence with countries whose relations with them are not so harmonious at present is possible?" Nehru replied: "Of course, peaceful coexistence with friends is not a problem, because it is inevitable. When you mention peaceful coexistence, you mean peaceful coexistence with those who disagree with you. The meaning of the Chinese leaders is beyond doubt, because they told me definitively and precisely that they hope to coexist peacefully with countries that oppose them, and they are prepared to establish friendly and diplomatic relations with all countries, including those that oppose them."

Regarding the slanderous remarks made by US Secretary of State Dulles recently about China's intentions, Prime Minister Nehru said: "The impression I myself have gained is that in the past few months, the Chinese government has provided much evidence to prove its peaceful intentions. It naturally denies any intention of interference, which is very clear; I do not know of any specific incidents of interference that have occurred anywhere recently."

Nehru said: "I do know that Chinese leaders are eager to establish peaceful relations, and that such peaceful relations can only exist on the basis of non-interference. They recognize this, and they have said, 'We have no intention of interfering internally or externally.'" "As far as I am concerned, I believe their words, because this statement is suitable to the objective situation in Asia, their country, and the world."

Prime Minister Nehru said that only friendly practices can guarantee security. Aggressive practices or practices containing elements of threat or fear on either side could threaten security. He believes that since the Geneva Conference, there has been a shift towards a friendly attitude. Therefore, it is appropriate to proceed further along that path through friendly cooperation and understanding, rather than through any threatening elements.

The reporter asked him whether he advocated resuming the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue. Nehru said that the conference should be reconvened at an appropriate time to discuss the Korean issue.

    尼赫鲁总理答英国广播公司记者问
    表示深信我国坚持和平共处原则
   【新华社新德里二十一日电】据德里报纸报道：印度总理尼赫鲁十九日晚在英国广播公司的每周特别节目中回答记者的问题时说：他十月间在北京和中国领袖们举行的会谈的基础是和平。尼赫鲁总理说，他深信中国人民坚持和平共处的原则。
    对于记者所提出的问题“你是否认为中国领袖们不但认为同友好的邻国和平共处是可能的，而且也认为同目前与他们的关系不太融洽的国家和平共处也是可能的”？尼赫鲁回答说：“当然，同朋友和平共处是不成问题的，因为这是不可避免的。当你提到和平共处时，你的意思是同那些跟你意见不一致的人和平共处。中国领袖们的意思是无可怀疑的，因为他们肯定地和确切地告诉我，他们希望同反对他们的国家和平共处，他们准备同一切国家，包括那些反对他们的国家建立友好关系和外交关系。”
    关于美国国务卿杜勒斯最近谈到中国意图的诽谤性谈话，尼赫鲁总理说：“我自己所得到的印象是，在过去的几个月中，中国政府已经提供了许多证据证明它的和平意图。它自然否认有任何干涉的意愿，这是十分清楚的；我不知道最近在任何地方发生任何具体的干涉事件。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我确实知道，中国领袖们渴望建立和平关系，而这种和平关系只可能在不干涉的基础上存在下去。他们认识到这一点，他们曾说，‘我们毫无从内部或从外部进行干涉的意图。’”“就我来说，我相信他们的话，因为这句话适合亚洲的和他们国家的以及世界的客观情况。”
    尼赫鲁总理说，只有彼此友好的做法才能保证安全。不论那一方的侵略的做法或含有威胁或恐惧成分的做法都可能使安全受到威胁。他认为，自从日内瓦会议以来，已有趋向友好态度的转变。因此，这样做是适当的：通过友好合作和谅解的办法沿着那条道路进一步前进而不要通过任何威胁成分。
    记者问他是否主张恢复关于朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议。尼赫鲁说，这个会议应该在适当的时候重新召开，以讨论朝鲜问题。
