    Heilongjiang Province Suileng Horticultural Experiment Farm Cultivates Cold-Resistant Fruit Trees
    Thanks to the efforts of China's horticultural workers, fruit trees such as apples, grapes, apricots, cherries, and plums are growing well at the Suileng Horticultural Experiment Farm in the cold Heilongjiang Province. More than 188,000 fruit trees cultivated by this experiment farm over the past few years are now facing the test of winter. The large Antonovka apple variety developed by the great biologist Michurin is also being cultivated at this horticultural experiment farm.
    The workers at this horticultural experiment farm, after studying Michurin's theories, grafted grapes onto wild grape roots in 1952, and they bore fruit this year. Sixty dwarf peach trees cultivated using the seedling domestication method to suit the local climate have also yielded hundreds of large, sweet, and palatable peaches this year. Eight four-year-old large apple seedling trees, cultivated using seedling domestication and cross-breeding methods, have not suffered from frost damage in the past few winters and can overwinter without artificial frost protection. Many people who have come to visit this experiment farm from various places have curiously asked: How are the staff here developing the horticultural industry in such a cold place? Some have even requested to be supplied with these cold-resistant seedlings.
    The experiment farm plans to promote the 140,000 small apple seedlings currently being grafted to various state-owned farms, collective farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province next year. These seedlings can be planted on approximately 500 hectares of land. If we calculate 20,000 jin of fruit produced per hectare, these 500 hectares will produce more than 10 million jin of fruit annually in the future, and the people of the whole province can eat almost one jin of such fruit on average. Last year, this experiment farm promoted more than 30,000 cold-resistant fruit trees such as apples and autumn pears to various farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province, and the situation is good. In addition, the amount of fruit supplied by this horticultural experiment farm for local people to eat is also increasing year by year. This year, the total is more than 44,800 jin, which is three times more than last year's output. (Xinhua News Agency)

    黑龙江省绥棱园艺试验场栽培耐寒果树
    由于我国园艺工作者的努力，苹果、葡萄、杏、樱桃、李子等果树，在寒冷的黑龙江省绥棱园艺试验场里生长良好。这个试验场几年来栽培的十八万八千多株果树，现在又在迎接寒冬的考验。伟大的生物学家米丘林育成的安托诺夫卡品种的大苹果，也正在这个园艺试验场中进行栽培。
    这个园艺试验场的工作者，学习了米丘林学说后，在一九五二年用山葡萄根嫁接的葡萄，今年已经结实。用实生驯化方法培育适合于当地气候的六十棵矮生桃，今年也已结了几百个香甜适口的大桃子。用实生驯化和杂交育种等方法培育的耐寒大苹果苗，已有四年生的大苹果实生苗八棵，在过去几个冬天没有受到冻害，并且可以不用人为防寒过冬了。许多从各地到这个试验场来参观的人们，都好奇地问过：这儿的工作人员是怎样在这样寒冷的地方发展着园艺事业的？有些人还要求供给这些耐寒树苗。
    试验场准备在明年把现在嫁接中的十四万棵小苹果苗向省内各个国营农场、集体农庄和农业生产合作社推广。这些树苗大约可栽五百多垧地。如果以每垧地产两万斤果子计算，这五百多垧地将来每年就可以产一千多万斤果子，全省人民差不多平均每人可以吃到一斤这样的果子。这个试验场去年已向省内各个农场和农业生产合作社推广了三万多株苹果、秋果等耐寒果树，情况良好。此外，这个园艺试验场供给本地人民食用的水果量也在逐年增加。今年总计有四万四千八百多斤，比去年的产量多三倍。　（新华社）
