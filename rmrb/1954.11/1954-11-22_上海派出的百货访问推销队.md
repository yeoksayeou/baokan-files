Shanghai Dispatches Department Store Visiting Sales Teams
Zhang Chao

In October, the Shanghai Municipal State-owned Department Store system dispatched fifteen department store visiting sales teams in succession to various parts of the country to carry out the work of sending industrial products to the countryside. Their footprints reached as far north as Heilongjiang, as far west as Urumqi City in Xinjiang Province, and as far south as Yunnan Province, covering seventeen provinces and cities.

They went deep into factories, mines, agricultural production cooperatives, and minority areas to conduct investigations and visits. They found that the people in the vast areas have great purchasing power and are in urgent need of various industrial products. Bicycles have become necessities for the workers of the Fangzi Coal Mine in Shandong Province; alarm clocks were immediately sold out upon arrival in the bountiful countryside of Shanxi Province; mimeograph machines and stationery paper found customers in many agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province; fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands now love cotton knitwear; and Hunan farmers, who mostly bought low-grade wool last year, are beginning to like buying high-grade wool worth more than 200,000 yuan per pound this year. Farmers in Yuzha Zhen, Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, love industrial products produced in Shanghai. Many people said, "The government sent these industrial products here for exhibition and asked for our opinions, which shows how much they care about us!" Even in the flood-stricken areas of Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province, after replanting and striving to increase production, the purchasing power of many families can still be increased by 10% compared to last year.

According to incomplete statistics, by early November, these fifteen department store visiting sales teams had successively visited more than twenty counties and cities, as well as many factories, mines, and rural areas. They have successively completed transactions worth more than 22 billion yuan with various regions, and have further understood the needs of the people in various regions, established contacts with vast areas, and opened up a broad sales market for Shanghai industrial products. Commodities such as soap, matches, and batteries, which once showed signs of oversupply, have now begun to sell well. Based on this situation, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company plans to organize various production units to increase production of commodities worth more than 100 billion yuan in the fourth quarter, on the condition of taking care of raw material supply and without adding equipment and workers, in order to better meet the needs of the people in various regions.

    上海派出的百货访问推销队
    张潮
    十月间，上海市国营百货系统先后派出十五个百货访问推销队，分别到全国各地，开展工业品下乡工作。他们的足迹北到黑龙江，西到新疆省的乌鲁木齐市，南到云南省，遍及十七个省、市。
    他们深入工厂、矿山、农业生产合作社、少数民族地区，进行了调查、访问。他们发现，广大地区的人民都有很大的购买力，迫切需要各种各样的工业品。自行车成了山东省坊子煤矿职工的必需品；闹钟一到山西省丰收的农村，立刻就被买光；油印机和文具纸张在山西省许多农业生产合作社里找到了主顾；舟山群岛的渔民现在都喜爱棉毛针织品；去年多半都买低档毛线的湖南农民，今年开始喜欢购买每磅值二十多万元的高档毛线。江苏省淮阴县渔汫镇的农民热爱上海出产的工业品，许多人说：“政府把这些工业品送到我们这里展览，征求我们的意见，真是太关心我们了！”即使在湖南省衡阳专区的水灾地区，农民们经过补种和努力增产以后，不少人家的购买力还可以比去年提高一成。
    根据不完全的统计，到十一月上旬，这十五个百货访问推销队已经先后访问了二十多个县、市及许多工厂、矿山和农村。他们已经同各地成交了价值二百二十多亿元的商品，并且进一步了解了各地人民的需要，同广大地区建立了联系，为上海工业品开辟了广阔的销路。原来一度呈现供过于求现象的肥皂、火柴、电池等商品，现在已经开始畅销。根据这种情况，中国百货公司上海采购供应站计划在照顾原料供应情况、不增添设备和工人的条件下，组织各生产单位在第四季度内增产价值一千多亿元的商品，以便更好地满足各地人民的需要。
