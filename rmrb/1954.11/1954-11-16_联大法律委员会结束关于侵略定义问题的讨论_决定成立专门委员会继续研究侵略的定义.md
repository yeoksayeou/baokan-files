    Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Legal Committee has concluded its discussion on the definition of aggression. The United States' attempt to have the United Nations indefinitely postpone the work of defining aggression was unsuccessful. The Legal Committee passed a proposal to establish a special committee to continue studying the definition of aggression. Thirty-three countries, including the Soviet Union and France, voted in favor of the proposal, while three countries, including the United States, voted against it, and fourteen countries, including the United Kingdom, abstained.

    The issue raised by the Soviet Union at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has been valued by many countries over the years. The Soviet Union's definition of aggression, proposed in 1953 at the United Nations Special Committee on Defining Aggression, clearly established the principle that any country that initiates a war, regardless of its pretext or motive, should be considered an aggressor. The Soviet Union also, in accordance with the wishes of some Asian, Arab, and Latin American countries, included in the definition of aggression definitions of indirect, economic, and ideological aggression. The United Nations Special Committee on Defining Aggression reported to this session that the majority of countries on the special committee believed that defining aggression was feasible and of great importance for maintaining international peace and security.

    At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the representative of the United States, as in the past, opposed any work to define aggression. The United States fears that once the definition of aggression is determined, it will restrain its own acts of aggression and prevent it from wantonly slandering other countries for engaging in "aggression." However, the US representative's attempt to postpone this work indefinitely did not receive the support of the majority of countries. Many Asian, Arab, and Latin American countries stated at the meeting that they believed it was necessary to define aggression.

    The resolution passed by the Legal Committee stipulates that a special committee should be established to study the various proposals and amendments on the definition of aggression put forward at this session, and to try to reconcile the different views of various countries on the definition of aggression during the discussion, in order to draft a definition of aggression and submit a report to the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    联大法律委员会结束关于侵略定义问题的讨论
    决定成立专门委员会继续研究侵略的定义
    【新华社十五日讯】纽约消息：联合国大会法律委员会已经结束了关于侵略定义问题的讨论。美国想使联合国无限期搁置确定侵略的定义的工作的企图没有能够成功。法律委员会通过了一项提案，决定成立一个专门委员会来继续就侵略的定义进行研究。苏联、法国等三十三个国家对这个提案投赞成票，美国等三个国家投反对票，英国等十四个国家弃权。
    苏联在联合国大会第五届会议上所提出的这个问题，历年来受到许多国家的重视。苏联一九五三年在联合国确定侵略定义问题专门小组委员会上提出的侵略定义，明确地确定了这样的原则：凡是首先发动战争的国家，不论它的借口或动机如何，都应该被视为侵略者。苏联并且按照一些亚洲、阿拉伯和拉丁美洲国家的愿望，使侵略定义中包括了间接的、经济上的和思想上的侵略的定义。联合国确定侵略定义问题专门小组委员会向本届会议报告说，小组委员会的大多数国家认为确定侵略的定义是行得通的，对于维持国际和平和安全是有很大作用的。
    在联合国大会本届会议上，美国的代表和以往一样，反对任何确定侵略定义的工作。美国害怕一旦确定了侵略的定义，将会约束自己的侵略行为，并且使它不能随心所欲地诬蔑别的国家进行“侵略”。但是，美国代表无限期搁置这一工作的企图，没有得到多数国家的支持。不少亚洲、阿拉伯和拉丁美洲的国家都在会上表示认为确定侵略的定义是有必要的。
    法律委员会通过的决议规定要成立一个专门委员会来研究在本届会议上所提出的关于侵略定义的各项提案和修正案，设法调和讨论过程中各国关于侵略的定义的不同观点，以拟出一个侵略的定义的草案，向联合国大会第十一届会议提出报告。
