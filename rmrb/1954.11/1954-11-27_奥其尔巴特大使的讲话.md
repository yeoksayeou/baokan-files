Esteemed Vice-Chairman, dear comrades and friends:
    Today, the entire Mongolian people are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic in our country.
    The establishment of the People's Republic was made possible by the victory of the people's revolution against imperialism and feudalism in 1921, and by the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in the Mongolian people's struggle for democratic reforms.
    After the Mongolian people adopted their first constitution on November 26, 1924, which legally consolidated the achievements of the Mongolian People's Revolution of 1921, they simultaneously became the masters of their own independent, free, and fully sovereign state. Under the glorious leadership of their People's Revolutionary Party and with the fraternal and comprehensive selfless assistance of the Soviet people, they have achieved great successes in the political, economic, and cultural development of their country.
    In close friendship and cooperation with all the people of the democratic camp, the Mongolian people are advancing confidently along the road to socialism.
    Our people highly value and cherish as the apple of our eye the friendship and consolidation with the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of all people's democratic countries.
    The fraternal friendship and economic and cultural cooperation between our people and the great Chinese people are developing and strengthening day by day for the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples. This friendship and cooperation is also conducive to the sacred cause of all peoples defending and consolidating peace and security.
    While joyfully celebrating their glorious festival—the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic—the Mongolian people also sincerely hope that their great neighbor—our fraternal great Chinese people—will achieve further new successes in the cause of socialist construction of their motherland and in the struggle to consolidate peace and security among all nations in the world.
    Long live the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people, which is being increasingly consolidated and developed!
    May the strength and united solidarity of our great family—the entire camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union—be increasingly consolidated and developed!
    Long live world peace! Esteemed Vice-Chairman, dear comrades and friends:
    Please allow me to propose a toast to the further consolidation of the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, to the great Chinese people, to the government of the People's Republic of China, to the Communist Party of China, to the wise leader of the Chinese people, the great friend of the Mongolian people, Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China's health!

    奥其尔巴特大使的讲话尊敬的副主席，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    今天蒙古全体人民正在我们国内庆祝蒙古人民共和国成立三十周年。
    由于一九二一年反对帝国主义和反对封建主义的人民革命得到了胜利，由于蒙古人民革命党正确地领导了蒙古人民进行民主改革的斗争，人民共和国的成立才成为可能。
    蒙古人民在一九二四年十一月二十六日通过了的自己第一个宪法，以法律的形式巩固了一九二一年蒙古人民革命所取得的成果后，同时就完全成为了自己独立、自由、主权完整的国家的主人，并且在自己光荣的人民革命党领导下和苏联人民兄弟般的、全面无私的援助下，在自己国家的政治、经济和文化发展上取得了巨大的成就。
    蒙古人民在与民主阵营全体人民的亲密友好和合作中正满怀信心地沿着走向社会主义的大道向前迈进。
    我们的人民崇高地估计着并像爱护自己眼珠一样地爱护和巩固着自己与伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊。
    我国人民和伟大中国人民兄弟般的友谊和经济、文化上的合作，正一天又一天地为了我们两国人民的繁荣和幸福在不断地发展着和巩固着。这种友谊和合作也有利于各国人民保卫和巩固和平与安全的神圣事业。
    蒙古人民在欢欣地庆祝自己光荣的节日——人民共和国成立三十周年的同时，还衷心地希望自己伟大的邻邦——我们兄弟般的伟大中国人民在为其祖国社会主义建设事业以及为巩固世界各民族之间和平与安全的斗争中取得更进一步的新成就。
    蒙中两国人民之间日益巩固着和发展着的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    祝我们伟大的家庭——以苏联为首的全体和平、民主阵营的力量和一致的团结日益巩固和发展起来！
    世界和平万岁！尊敬的副主席，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    请允许我提议为以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量进一步得到巩固，为伟大的中国人民，为中华人民共和国政府，为中国共产党，为中国人民的英明领袖、蒙古人民的伟大朋友、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的健康干杯！
