Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: The over 63.48 million mu of winter wheat sown by farmers in Shandong Province according to the national plan have emerged completely and vigorously, presenting a lush green scene. Farmers in various places are now actively strengthening winter wheat field management in order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year. In order to prevent wheat seedlings from suffering frost damage, farmers in areas with water conservancy conditions such as along the Xiaofu River and in Huang County and Ye County are preparing to carry out winter irrigation; in areas without water conservancy conditions, farmers also plan to move snow into the wheat fields.
This year, under the impetus and assistance of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the winter wheat sowing in Shandong Province was mostly carried out in a timely manner. The vast majority of wheat fields throughout the province were sown before the Frost's Descent solar term. Before sowing, the state supplied farmers with a large number of double-wheeled double-furrow plows and new-style walking plows, greatly expanding the area of deep plowing of wheat fields. Various localities also mobilized women and children to follow the plows to pick up pests when plowing wheat fields, and the use of pesticides to kill underground pests during sowing was also more common than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: The more than 100,000 mu of farmland in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area of ​​Hubei Province that have receded from flooding have been rushed to plant barley, wheat, peas, and rapeseed. These winter crops are now a lush green.
The farmers in the flood diversion area showed tenacious and heroic spirit in the intense winter ploughing and sowing work. When the floodwaters had just receded, the silt in the fields was very deep and people could not stand on it, so many farmers lay in the fields to sow seeds. Members of the Tongxin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Buhe Township, Jingjiang County, even tied wide wooden boards to their feet to go into the fields to sow seeds. Where the silt was less or the silt was slightly dry, the farmers carried out ploughing and hoeing, working carefully and meticulously. The more than 4,000 mu of fields drained in Dasheng Township were generally ploughed once and harrowed twice. Agricultural production cooperatives such as Wuxing and Hongxing have even achieved two ploughings and three harrowings.
In order to strive for a bumper harvest next year, the farmers in the flood diversion area have also changed their views of “fertile fields after waterlogging” and “fallow land is like resting a horse, no harvest in the fields for three seasons,” and have launched a manure accumulation campaign. Forty-three mutual aid teams in Daguang Township accumulated more than 12,000 dan of manure in one month. Many agricultural production cooperatives also carried out grain selection and mud selection for this year's wheat seeds, and changed the wheat sowing method from broadcasting in the past to row sowing.

    山东省六千多万亩冬小麦出苗齐全
    荆江分洪区农民抢种的冬季作物生长良好
    【新华社济南十九日电】山东省农民按照国家计划播种的六千三百四十八万亩冬小麦，出苗齐全、旺盛，呈现着一片嫩绿色。现在各地农民正积极加强冬季麦田管理，争取明年小麦丰收。为了预防麦苗遭受冻害，孝妇河沿岸和黄县、掖县等有水利条件的地区，农民准备进行冬浇；没有水利条件的地区，农民也打算向麦田里搬雪。
    今年山东省农民在互助合作组织的带动和帮助下，冬小麦播种多很适时。全省绝大部分麦田是在霜降前下种的。播种前，国家供应农民大批双轮双铧犁和新式步犁，使麦田深耕面积大大扩大。各地还在犁翻麦田时发动妇女、儿童跟犁拾害虫，播种时采用农药毒杀地下害虫的也较往年为多。
    据新华社武汉十九日电：湖北省荆江分洪区退水的十多万亩农田，已抢种了大麦、小麦、豌豆和油菜。现在这些冬季作物已是一片葱绿。
    分洪区的农民在紧张地冬耕冬播工作中，表现了顽强的英勇精神。洪水刚退，田中淤泥很深，不能站人，许多农民就在田里卧着撒种。荆江县埠河乡同心农业生产合作社社员，还在脚上绑上宽大的木板下田撒种。淤泥较小或淤泥稍干，农民就进行耕锄，精耕细作。大胜乡出水的四千多亩田，一般都作到了一耕二耙。五星、红星等农业生产合作社并作到了二耕三耙。
    为了争取明年丰收，分洪区农民还改变了“水过田肥”、“歇田如歇马，三季不收在田里”的看法，开展了积肥运动。大光乡四十三个互助组一个月积粪达一万二千多担。许多农业生产合作社对今年的麦种还进行了粒选、泥选，并把麦子的播种方法由过去的撒播改为条播。
