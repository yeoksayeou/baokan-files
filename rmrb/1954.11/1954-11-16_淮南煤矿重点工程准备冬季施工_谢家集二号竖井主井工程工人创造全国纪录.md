    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: Huainan Coal Mine is actively preparing for winter construction of key projects. These winter construction projects include the coal bunker at Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine, ground temporary buildings for the Laishanjii new mine project, and the winch room for the Xiejiachi No. 2 shaft.

    Currently, carpenter and bricklayer teams have been organized at the Laishanjii new mine ground project site. Construction has fully commenced at the sites ready for work. Raincoats, coir coats, rubber boots, rubber shoes, and gloves needed for winter construction have also been purchased. The coal bunker at Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine is entirely a reinforced concrete project. To complete this project in winter, higher authorities have allocated 1 billion yuan as equipment expenses for winter construction. Now, the construction of sheds needed for winter work has begun, and heating equipment will be installed in these sheds.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: The shaft lining project of the Xiejiachi No. 2 shaft has been completed ahead of schedule. The project quality meets standards, no personal accidents occurred during the construction process, and the cost was reduced by about 5% compared to the plan. Another newly built shaft, the Xiejiachi No. 3 shaft, from the start of construction in July to the end of October, advanced more than 9 meters beyond the national plan.

    The Xiejiachi No. 2 shaft began regular cyclical operations in late May. The most labor-intensive work in the shaft construction, such as drilling, blasting, and removing gangue, has been made much faster by the promotion of the Soviet deep-hole blasting method and the use of the Soviet rock grab, which has more than doubled the speed of each blasting and increased the efficiency of gangue removal by nine times. Inspired by advanced Soviet experiences such as prefabricated walls and prefabricated stairs, the engineering and technical personnel of Huainan Coal Mine Construction Company also created a method of prefabricating beam pockets to replace the past method of leaving beam pockets, ensuring the specifications and quality of the shaft walls. Xiejiachi No. 2 shaft has also established regular safety inspections, safety education, and personal safety work record books, and there is also a safety activity day once a week. Due to the continuous improvement of the technical level and labor enthusiasm of the workers, the workers of the Xiejiachi No. 2 shaft main shaft project created a national record of a monthly advance of 38.112 meters of completed shaft in August.

    淮南煤矿重点工程准备冬季施工
    谢家集二号竖井主井工程工人创造全国纪录
    【新华社合肥十五日电】淮南煤矿正积极进行重点工程的冬季施工准备工作。这些冬季施工的工程包括新庄孜煤矿的煤仓、癞山集新井工程的地面临时建筑和谢家集二号竖井的绞车房。
    目前，在癞山集新井的地面工程工地，木工组和瓦工组已经组织好了；具备开工条件的工地上，已开始全面施工了。冬季施工时所需要的雨衣、棕衣、胶靴、胶鞋、手套等也都购置好了。新庄孜煤矿的煤仓全部是钢筋混凝土工程，为了在冬季完成这项工程，上级已拨款十亿元作为冬季施工的设备费用。现在，冬季施工时需要的工棚，已着手建设，这个工棚内将来要装置暖气设备。
    【新华社合肥十五日电】淮南谢家集二号竖井的井筒斫砌工程已提前完成。工程质量合乎标准，施工过程中没有发生人身事故，成本比计划降低了百分之五左右。另一座新建竖井——谢家集三号竖井，从七月开工到十月底止，成井进尺也比国家计划多进了九公尺多。
    谢家集二号竖井从五月下旬开始走上了正规的循环作业。建井工程中费工最多的打眼放炮和出矸子的工作，由于推广苏联深孔爆破法，使用苏联抓岩机，使得每碴炮的进度提高了一倍多，出矸子效率提高了九倍。淮南煤矿建井公司的工程技术人员在苏联预制墙、预制楼梯等先进经验的启发下，还创造了一种预制梁窝的方法以代替过去留梁窝的办法，保证了竖井井壁的规格和质量。谢家集二号竖井还建立了经常性的保安检查、保安教育和个人保安工作记录簿等制度，每星期还有一次安全活动日。由于职工技术水平和劳动热情不断提高，谢家集二号竖井主井工程的工人八月份创造了单行作业月进成井三十八点一一二公尺的全国纪录。
