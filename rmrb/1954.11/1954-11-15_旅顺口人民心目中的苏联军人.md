The Soviet soldiers stationed in the Lüshunkou area, over the past few years, have demonstrated the noble qualities and internationalist spirit of the Soviet people in their interactions with local residents, leaving an unforgettable impression on their hearts.

The fisherman Ding Zuoxin's family in a fishing village often talks about the scene of a Soviet soldier bravely helping his family put out a fire; this Soviet soldier also found a Soviet military doctor to treat Ding Zuoxin's wife's burns. Before Ding Zuoxin's wife recovered, these two Soviet soldiers visited her every day or two to apply medicine and change bandages until her burns were completely healed. Once, villager Ding Xinfa's foot was badly pricked, and he was in so much pain that he couldn't sleep day and night. A young Soviet military doctor, after learning about this, came to treat him every morning and evening, without interruption even on rainy days. During typhoon attacks, a street in the Lüshunkou area experienced strong currents, with floodwaters surging into the low-lying areas in waves. Many local Soviet soldiers braved the danger to repeatedly rescue residents' lives and property. Han Shuhong's six-year-old daughter suddenly fell into the water, and a Soviet soldier rushed into the flood to save the little girl, regardless of his own safety.

The Soviet soldiers also cared for the lives of local residents in various ways. Many Soviet soldiers often helped residents near their station to harvest crops and carry out cultural and recreational activities in their spare time. Some Soviet soldiers even cleaned streets and courtyards and removed garbage with the residents. Some Soviet soldiers cut grass and sent it to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel as firewood in their spare time. These actions of the Soviet soldiers have become popular stories among the residents of the Lüshunkou area. People often sing a song like this: Great friendship, brotherly hearts, mountains cannot block, seas cannot divide...

Many residents of Lüshunkou and their neighbors—the Soviet soldiers and their families—have become close friends. Yuan Guilan, an illiterate woman, initially felt that she was too old and found it difficult to learn to read. Her Soviet neighbor, Rena, often encouraged her to study hard by telling her about her own 70-year-old mother's participation in learning. Under Rena's encouragement, she can now recognize more than a thousand characters. Although Rena has moved away, Yuan Guilan always misses her. Zhang Juying's neighbor, Maria, often helped Zhang Juying in various ways. Zhang Juying lacked confidence in participating in production because she had many children. After Maria learned about this, she constantly introduced her to the glorious examples of mothers with many children participating in labor in the Soviet Union, showed her picture albums, and sometimes helped her take care of her children. Thanks to Maria's help, Zhang Juying actively overcame difficulties and participated in production. Now she has become the leader of a women's group in an agricultural production cooperative.

Now, when the residents of the Lüshunkou area mention the days they spent with the Soviet troops, they all have a feeling of reluctance to part with the Soviet soldiers who will soon be leaving. However, they all feel that this friendship will last forever. An old woman named Wang Yuexiang said: "People are separated, but friendship cannot be separated. The Chinese and Soviet people will always be one family."

    旅顺口人民心目中的苏联军人
    驻旅顺口地区的苏军将士们，几年来和当地居民相处时表现出的苏联人民的高贵品质和国际主义精神，已经在人们心目中留下了永远难忘的印象。
    一个渔村的渔民丁作新一家人常常和人谈起一位苏联军人奋不顾身地帮助他家救火的情景；这位苏联军人并找来一个苏联军医替丁作新的妻子治疗火伤，丁作新的妻子伤愈以前，这两个苏联军人每隔一两天就来看望她，替她上药换药，一直到她的火伤完全痊愈。有一次，村民丁新发的脚扎坏了，痛得日夜不能睡觉，一个年轻的苏联军医知道后，每天早晚都来替他医治，大雨天也没有间断过。在台风袭击的日子里，旅顺口地区曾有一条街道水势很猛，洪水一阵阵地涌进洼地。当地的许多苏联军人都冒着危险，一次又一次地抢救居民的生命和财产。居民韩树洪六岁的小女儿突然掉进了水里，一个苏联战士不顾一切地冲进洪水中救起了这个小女孩。
    苏军将士们还从各个方面关怀着当地居民的生活，许多苏联军人在空闲时常常帮助驻地附近的居民收割庄稼，开展文化娱乐活动，有的苏联军人还和居民一起打扫街道院巷，清除垃圾。有些苏联军人在空闲时割草送给烈属、军属当柴火。苏军将士们这些举动已经在旅顺口地区的居民中传为美谈。人们常唱这样一首歌：伟大的友谊，兄弟般的心，山不能阻挡，海不能分……。
    旅顺口不少居民和他们的邻居——苏军将士们和军官家属已成了亲密的朋友。一个不识字的妇女袁桂兰起先觉得自己年纪大了，识字很困难，她的苏联邻居任娜却常常用自己七十多岁老母亲参加学习的事情鼓励她刻苦学习，在任娜的鼓励下，现在她已经能认识一千多字了，任娜现在虽已搬走，袁桂兰却总是对她念念不忘。妇女张菊英的邻居玛丽雅常常从各方面帮助张菊英。张菊英因为孩子多，对参加生产没有信心，玛丽雅知道后，不断地给她介绍苏联多子女的母亲参加劳动的光辉榜样，给她看画报，有时帮助她照顾孩子。由于玛丽雅的帮助，张菊英积极克服困难参加生产，现在她已经成为一个农业生产合作社的妇女组组长。
    现在，旅顺口地区的居民一提起和苏军相处的日子，对不久将要离开的苏军将士们都有一种依依惜别的心情，但是，他们都觉得这样的友谊是永远存在的，一个名字叫王月香的老大娘说：“人分离了，友谊不能离，中苏人民永远是一家人。”（新华社）
