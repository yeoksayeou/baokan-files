    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Reduce Costs by Over 200 Billion Yuan
    Capital Construction Department Exceeds This Year's Cost Reduction Plan
   [This newspaper's Anshan dispatch on the 24th] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works (Ansteel) has achieved great success in reducing production costs. From January to the end of October, the total cost reduction of various factories and mines amounted to 236.409 billion yuan. The largest reductions were in raw material consumption quotas and workshop expenses. From January to the end of September, raw material consumption quotas were reduced by 101.38 billion yuan, and workshop expenses were reduced by 97.933 billion yuan. The main reasons for the significant achievements in cost reduction are: the majority of workers in various factories and mines, under the education of the general task of the state's transition period, recognized the great significance of cost reduction. While improving equipment and production technology, they implemented accounting supervision systems and economic accounting systems for work teams. For example, the primary rolling mill implemented accounting supervision and work team economic accounting, eliminating unaccounted-for losses and saving the state 11,185 tons of steel billets. The iron smelting plant implemented accounting supervision and work team economic accounting, saving 6,293 tons of manganese ore by using open-hearth slag for iron smelting alone.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has exceeded this year's cost reduction plan by 15 percent. This plan's target is approximately 140 percent higher than last year.
    This year, Ansteel's construction companies have established basic-level economic accounting systems. Economic activity analyses are conducted every quarter and every month, and specific measures and plans for cost reduction are formulated. These plans are strictly implemented from the engineering companies down to the work teams. At the same time, the engineering companies have also held party representative meetings, criticizing the thinking of some cadres who do not pay attention to economic work. As a result, cost reduction has become a concern for everyone on the construction site. One construction site director of the Rolling Mill Construction Engineering Company, who in the past did not enter the finance department's door throughout the year, now goes to the finance department every month to study the cost reduction plan. Losses were previously incurred due to work stoppages, but this year, each work section proactively supplements manpower to each other, reducing labor costs. In the past, materials were discarded everywhere when they were taken out of the warehouse. Now, from the engineering company to the work team, there are dedicated personnel responsible for material management, and every worker also pays attention to the recycling of old materials. The Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company recovered more than 1,900 tons of old bricks, reducing expenses by more than 6 billion yuan. The Electrical Installation Engineering Company implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, saving 2.4 billion yuan in cable and electromagnetic bottle costs by using short materials for short uses.
    Ansteel's engineering companies still have great potential for savings that have not been exploited. The workers on each construction site are working hard to reduce more construction costs for the country by the end of the year.

    鞍钢各厂矿降低成本两千多亿元
    基本建设部门超额完成今年降低成本计划
   【本报鞍山二十四日电】鞍钢生产厂矿降低成本获得很大成绩。从一月到十月底为止，各厂矿降低成本的总数为二千三百六十四亿零九百万元。其中以原材料消费定额的降低和车间经费的节省为最大，从一月到九月底，原材料消耗定额降低一千零一十三亿八千万元，车间经费节约九百七十九亿三千三百万元。各厂矿能够在降低成本方面做出显著的成绩，主要的原因是：大部分厂矿的职工在国家过渡时期总任务的教育下，认识了降低成本的重大意义，在改进设备和提高生产技术的同时，实行了会计监督制度和班组经济核算制度。如初轧厂实行了会计监督和班组经济核算制度，消灭了找不着根据的无头损失，为国家节约了一万一千一百八十五吨钢坯。炼铁厂实行了会计监督和班组经济核算，仅利用平炉废渣炼铁就节省锰矿六千二百九十三吨。
    新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门，已超额百分之十五完成了今年降低成本的计划。这个计划指标约比去年提高百分之一百四十。
    鞍钢各工程公司今年都建立了基层经济核算制，每季、每月都进行一次经济活动分析，制订出具体的降低成本的措施计划。从工程公司一直到小组，都严格地执行这个计划。同时，各工程公司还召开过党代表会议，批判了某些干部不重视经济工作的思想。因而，降低成本在工地上已成为人人关心的工作。轧钢建筑工程公司有一个工地主任过去一年四季不进财务科的门，现在他每月都到财务科去研究一次降低成本的计划。去年曾因窝工带来损失，今年各工段都主动地相互补充人力，减少人工费的开支。过去材料出库遍地丢，现在从工程公司到小组，都有专人负责材料管理，每个工人还注意了回收旧料的工作。工业筑炉工程公司回收旧砖一千九百多吨，就减少了六十多亿元的开支。电气安装工程公司执行苏联专家建议，用短料短用等方法节省了二十四亿元的电缆线、电磁瓶。
    鞍钢各工程公司在节约方面还有很大潜力没有发挥，各工地的职工们正以再接再厉的精神，争取到年底为国家降低更多的建设费用。
