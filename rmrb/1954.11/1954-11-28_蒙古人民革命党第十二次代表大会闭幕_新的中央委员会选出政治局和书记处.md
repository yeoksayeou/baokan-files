    The letter further stated: The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, relying on the increasingly consolidated alliance of the working class and the working herdsmen, constantly learning from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, uniting its ranks, and uniting the broadest masses of the people around itself, is capable of leading our people to socialism.

    The letter concluded: The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, educates the Mongolian working people, and it is determined to continue to do its utmost to safeguard and consolidate world peace and strengthen the powerful camp of democracy and socialism headed by the great Soviet Union.
