Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 16th: The "Pravda" published on the 15th carried a letter from Pierre Goutard in Paris, describing the struggle of French patriots against the remilitarization of West Germany.

Goutard wrote: The aversion to the arming of West Germany, in whatever form it is expressed, continues to be a political factor dominating the entire life of France, shared by the vast majority of French residents. The force that once compelled the rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty continues to strive to achieve the rejection of the Paris Accords.

Goutard pointed out: It is noteworthy that the enemies of international cooperation, after the signing of the Paris Accords, openly stated their refusal to peacefully resolve the German question, saying: West Germany should be armed first, and then negotiations should be held with the Soviet Union. More and more French people are firmly demanding that negotiations on the German question begin immediately, without waiting for the ratification of the Paris Accords. This demand is supported not only by those who oppose the Paris Accords, but also by those who, until recently, supported the Paris Accords, but who now believe that it would be wrong to proceed with the ratification of the accords if the possibility of negotiations with the East has not been fully exhausted. Precisely because of this, Goutard said, the appeal to the people issued by the Executive Committee of the French National Peace Council on October 28 has gained widespread support in these days.

Goutard refuted the argument of so-called "Franco-German economic cooperation" that has emerged since the Paris Conference. He pointed out that for the French petty and middle bourgeoisie, the result of "economic cooperation" with West German militarists will be nothing but bankruptcy and being swallowed up by large monopoly capitalists, not to mention the real threat of war that will envelop all strata of French society once the Paris Accords are implemented.

The French working class knows very well that once France and militarized West Germany sign a so-called "economic agreement," it will mainly mean that German experts will flood French industry, the scope of social subsidies will be reduced, and wages will be lowered to the lowest level.

Goutard, after pointing out that the French Communists will use all their strength to build a united front of the working class and unite national and democratic forces to safeguard the future and peace of France, said: The road to guaranteeing French security is to establish a genuine European collective security system that unites all European countries, regardless of social system. Only by taking this path can France guarantee the French people lasting peace and conditions for independence and progress.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 16th: Calls for the reunification of Germany through negotiations are growing in West German political circles.

Carlo Schmid (Social Democrat), Vice President of the West German Federal Parliament, spoke in Ohlendorf on the 14th, opposing the Bonn government's rearmament under the pretext of the "threat from the East." Schmid called on everyone to recognize and consider the relationship between the rearmament of Germany and the peaceful restoration of German unity, saying: The restoration of German unity can only be achieved if the four occupying powers reach an agreement on the issue of free elections. He also stated that a reunified Germany should refuse to form military alliances with large blocs of countries.

The Soviet government's proposal on the 13th to convene an all-European conference on November 29 to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system has attracted widespread attention from people in the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party. Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer believes that this time Western countries "cannot simply reject the Soviet invitation." A Free Democratic Party member of parliament in Hamburg telegraphed Free Democratic Party Chairman Dehler, urging the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group and government ministers to do their best to ensure that the all-European conference proposed by the Soviet Union is held as scheduled on November 29. Dehler himself also stated that the Soviet note must be considered "seriously and sincerely."

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: According to TASS reports, people in Norway and Denmark are expressing opposition to the rearmament of West Germany.

The trade union of Norway's largest shipyard, "Akers Shipyard," the Bergen City Shipbuilding Workers' Union, the Moss City Construction Workers' Union, the Haugesund Housewives' Association, and other organizations have submitted protests to the Norwegian Parliament. These protests emphasized that the Norwegian people have not forgotten the five years of German occupation, and the parliament must oppose the remilitarization of West Germany, which paves the way for new wars.

The Labour Party youth organization and the women's organization of the Ålesund branch also passed a resolution against arming West Germany.

The Danish newspaper "Land og Folk" publishes daily news about protests from workers, trade union organizations, and cultural workers, as well as news about factory rallies and residents' rallies in various cities.

"Free Denmark" published an article by the prominent radical Viego Nadsen, criticizing the Danish government and the parliamentary majority for their position on the rearmament of West Germany. He said that the Danish parliamentary majority's support for West German remilitarization means supporting a policy that exacerbates international tensions and acknowledging that Denmark cannot act as a sovereign state within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Danish foreign policy is made in Washington and London, and will soon be made in Bonn as well.

    西欧各国人民反对重新武装西德
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十五日“真理报”刊载了皮埃尔·古达德的巴黎来信，信中叙述法国爱国者反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。
    古达德写道：极大多数法国居民无论以那种形式表现出来的对武装西德的仇视，都是继续支配着法国整个生活的政治因素。那种曾经迫使“欧洲防务集团”条约遭到拒绝的力量还在继续为达到拒绝巴黎协定的目的而奋斗。
    古达德指出：值得注意的是，国际合作的敌人在签订了巴黎协定之后就公开表示拒绝和平解决德国问题，他们说：首先应该武装西德，然后再来和苏联谈判。越来越多的法国人都坚决要求现在立刻就德国问题开始谈判，而不等批准巴黎协定。支持这种要求的不仅有反对巴黎协定的人，而且有在不久以前还是拥护巴黎协定的人，他们现在认为：如果同东方进行谈判的可能性还没有完全用尽而就着手批准协定，那是错误的。正因为如此，古达德说：法国全国和平理事会执行委员会十月二十八日的告人民书在这些日子里获得了广泛的支持。
    古达德驳斥了巴黎会议以后出现的一种所谓“法德经济合作”的论调。他指出：对于法国中小资产阶级来说，和西德军国主义者的“经济合作”的结果将不是别的，而是破产和被大垄断资本家吞并，姑且不说一旦巴黎协定实现即将笼罩法国社会各阶级的现实的战争威胁。
    法国工人阶级很清楚地知道：一旦法国和军国主义化的西德签订所谓“经济协定”，那就主要意味着：德国专家布满法国工业，社会补助金的范围将缩小，工资将降低到最低的水平。
    古达德在指出法国共产党员将用全力建立工人阶级的统一战线，团结民族和民主的力量以维护法国的前途与和平后说：保证法国安全的道路是要建立起不分社会制度、联合所有欧洲国家的真正的欧洲集体安全体系。法国只有走这条道路，才能保证法国人民获得持久的和平，获得独立和进步的条件。
    【新华社十六日讯】波恩消息：要求经过谈判来统一德国的呼声在西德政界日益增强着。
    西德联邦议院副主席卡洛·施密特（社会民主党）十四日在奥万道夫发表演说，反对波恩政府以“东方的威胁”作借口来进行重新武装。施密特号召大家认清并考虑重新武装德国同和平恢复德国统一之间的关系，他说：只有四个占领国在举行自由选举的问题上达成协议，恢复德国统一才可能实现。他并且表示：恢复统一后的德国应当拒绝和庞大的国家集团结成军事同盟。
    苏联政府十三日照会提出的关于在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议，引起了社会民主党和自由民主党的人士的广泛注意。社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔认为，这一次西方国家“不可能只是简单地拒绝苏联的邀请”。汉堡的一个自由民主党议员打电报给自由民主党的主席戴勒，要求自由民主党议会党团和政府部长尽力使苏联建议的全欧会议得以在十一月二十九日如期召开。戴勒本人也表示：必须“认真地和诚意地”考虑苏联的照会。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社报道：挪威和丹麦各地人民表示反对重新武装西德。
    挪威全国最大的造船厂“阿格斯造船厂”的工会、卑尔根城造船工人工会、摩斯城建筑工人工会、豪格桑家庭妇女联合会以及其他一些组织都向挪威议会提出了抗议书。这些抗议书强调指出，挪威人民没有忘记德国的五年占领，议会必须反对为新战争开辟道路的西德重新军国主义化。
    工党青年组织和妇女组织阿累桑城支部也通过了反对武装西德的决议。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”每天都刊载关于工人、工会组织和文化工作者的抗议以及关于工厂集会、各城市居民集会抗议的消息。
    “自由丹麦报”发表了著名的激进党人维戈·纳德生的一篇文章，指责丹麦政府和议会多数派在重新武装西德问题上所采取的立场。他说：丹麦议会多数派赞成西德重新军国主义化就是支持一种使国际紧张局势恶化的政策，承认丹麦在北大西洋公约组织中不能以一个主权国家的身份采取行动。丹麦的外交政策是在华盛顿和伦敦制定的，不久也将在波恩制定。
