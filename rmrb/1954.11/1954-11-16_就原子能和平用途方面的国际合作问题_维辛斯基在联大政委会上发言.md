On the Issue of International Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy
Vyshinsky Speaks at the UN Political Committee

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the issue of international cooperation in developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy. At the afternoon meeting on November 12th, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly heard a speech by Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, on the issue of international cooperation in developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

The Soviet representative began his speech by describing the role of Russian and Soviet scientists in the development of nuclear physics and related scientific fields, and the application of atomic energy and radioactive materials in Soviet industry, agriculture, biology, and medicine. Vyshinsky said that the generation of electricity by the Soviet Union's first atomic power station was the most important step in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This world's first atomic power station, with a usable power generation capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, began generating electricity in the Soviet Union on June 27, 1954, and supplied electricity to industry and agriculture. Soviet scientists are currently studying the construction projects of atomic power stations with power generation capacities of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts.

Having every opportunity to produce atomic energy on a large scale, the Soviet state is deeply interested in using this new type of energy only for peaceful purposes, only for the benefit of the people, because this application of atomic energy opens up great prospects for greatly increasing productivity, developing technology and culture, and increasing national wealth, not only for our country, but also for all peace-loving countries that are ready to implement large-scale plans to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Therefore, it is only natural that the Soviet Union firmly advocates using atomic energy only for peaceful purposes, while striving to protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the people of all other countries that care about peace and prevent the danger of a new world war from being threatened.

When Vyshinsky spoke of the pessimistic views in the West that atomic power stations would only be "commercially profitable" after twenty years, he said: on the one hand, the policy of stockpiling nuclear weapons, and on the other hand, commercial considerations and interests related to the fact that using atomic energy for peaceful purposes is currently unprofitable; these two undoubtedly create huge obstacles for Western countries to implement large-scale plans to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet government believes that the international agency dealing with the peaceful uses of atomic energy will only be able to successfully carry out its tasks when it is established on the basis of corresponding agreements between countries and when its power, which is large enough for it to successfully carry out its tasks, is not used to harm the security of this or that country. Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet delegation had asked Lodge for some clarification on the United States' current proposal to reduce the responsibility of this international agency to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Lodge's answer—though evasive—undoubtedly shows that the United States is trying to obstruct the Security Council from participating in the solution of this issue. Mr. Lodge spoke of linking this international agency to the United Nations through an agreement similar to the agreement between the United Nations and the specialized agencies—whose ties with the United Nations General Assembly are very weak, and whose ties with the Security Council are even weaker; this statement is contrary to the principles put forward in the Soviet memorandum of September 22. Vyshinsky reminded the representatives that the resolution unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on January 24, 1946, stipulated that the committee established at that time to consider the issues arising from the discovery of atomic energy should submit its reports and recommendations to the Security Council, and publish these reports and recommendations, unless the Security Council decides otherwise for the sake of peace and security. This resolution stated that the committee should report on its work to the Security Council on all these issues.

Therefore, judging from the aforementioned resolution, there is no doubt about the relationship that must exist between the committee established in 1946 with similar powers and the currently proposed international agency dealing with the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Vyshinsky emphasized the close relationship between the issue of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. In his speech, he stated that several representatives had acknowledged the existence of this relationship in the Political Committee's speeches on this issue.

The head of the Soviet delegation recalled that at the previous session of the General Assembly, these two issues were also considered to be closely related.

He reminded the representatives that when the General Assembly held its first session in January 1946, it unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing a special committee to draft recommendations on controlling atomic energy on the scale necessary for devoting it exclusively to peaceful purposes, and to draft a recommendation for the elimination of atomic weapons from national armaments.

The Soviet representative pointed out that using atomic energy for peaceful purposes not only does not preclude the possibility of stockpiling atomic weapons, but, in some cases, can even promote such stockpiling, which is why the Soviet government insists on taking unconditional measures to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, or taking the first important step towards this goal, unconditionally renouncing the use of such weapons.

Vyshinsky went on to say that we have stated that an agreement between countries to unconditionally renounce the use of atomic weapons as an important step towards completely prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating atomic weapons from national armaments is of paramount importance to the rapid implementation of the various measures proposed in the convention proposed by the Soviet government. At the same time, we stated in our proposal of September 30, 1954, that the implementation of the plans proposed in these recommendations is not conditional on reaching the aforementioned agreement. The Soviet Union also adopts the same position on the issue of participating in international agreements on the peaceful uses of atomic energy and participating in international agencies established for this purpose.

Vyshinsky continued, the Soviet Union warmly supports the proposal to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

The Soviet Union believes that it is also necessary to continue to seek a fundamental solution to the problem of using atomic energy, and without a fundamental solution to this problem, it cannot be guaranteed that atomic energy will not be used to manufacture atomic weapons.

The Soviet government is convinced that the possibility of reaching an agreement on the issue of international cooperation in developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy has absolutely not been fully explored.

However, the Soviet government is deeply convinced that international cooperation in this area can only be effective if it is built on principles that exclude any possibility of using such cooperation to infringe on the legitimate interests of some countries, and that any agreement on international cooperation in developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy should not put any one country or some countries in a privileged position to impose their will on other countries.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the United States' attempt to weaken the ties between the proposed agency and the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council violates these principles. Vyshinsky said that not only that, some of the clauses included in the "Seven-Nation" proposal actually predetermine the nature of this international agency. Although this issue still needs to be considered in the negotiations that the United States has expressed its willingness to conduct with the Soviet Union on issues related to the international agency for organizing the application of atomic energy to peaceful purposes.

We believe that the Seven-Nation proposal must conform to some of the aforementioned facts, and those clauses that actually predetermine the nature of this international agency must be deleted from this proposal.

Vyshinsky drew the Political Committee's attention to the fact that the recommendations made by Mr. Lodge of the United States were a major step backwards from the United States memorandum of March 19, 1954, and President Eisenhower's speech on December 8, 1953, because these recommendations reduced the scale of international cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This is also a step backwards from the plan mentioned in the President's speech to reduce the "potential destructive power of the world's atomic stockpile," and this plan is not mentioned in the current United States recommendations and the Seven-Nation proposal. Moreover, this is also a step backwards from the technical and economic assistance to underdeveloped countries stipulated in the previous recommendations, and this point cannot be found in the recently proposed proposals.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the Soviet Union supports the principle of international cooperation in developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has always firmly advocated, and still firmly advocates, conducting this cooperation and using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

As for the Seven-Nation proposal, the Soviet delegation must point out that it has many major shortcomings: it restricts the number of participants in the international agency and the international convention, and stipulates the establishment of an international agency that is a specialized agency rather than a United Nations agency. This shortcoming hinders the development of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Soviet delegation also believes that many issues related to international cooperation in this area need to be considered in future negotiations between the relevant countries. Our delegation intends to discuss this issue again when the specific recommendations contained in the Seven-Nation proposal are brought up for discussion.

Vyshinsky's speech aroused great interest among representatives, the public, and the press.

After Vyshinsky's speech, U.S. Representative Lodge spoke to attack the principle of great power unanimity.

In the days of discussion from the 9th to the 12th, representatives from many countries spoke. The Swedish representative expressed several major reservations about the Seven-Nation proposal. He supported the Soviet Union's argument in negotiations with the United States on the peaceful uses of atomic energy: to prevent the use of fissile materials for military purposes, there must be some guarantees. He favored closer ties between the UN and the proposed international agency.

The Egyptian representative said that without the participation of the Soviet Union, the entire plan for the peaceful use of atomic energy would not be fully effective.

The South African representative called on all relevant countries to strive for a comprehensive agreement on the issues currently under discussion.

The Danish representative pointed out that the Seven-Nation proposal did not address the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the Danish government and people would welcome a solution to this issue.

The Yugoslav representative emphasized that atomic energy must be used to develop the national economies of underdeveloped countries. He expressed his belief that the hope of reaching an agreement on the issues under discussion had also increased because the committee unanimously adopted the disarmament proposal.

The Syrian representative emphasized more strongly that it is necessary to make a unanimous decision on this issue that can be accepted by all directly relevant parties. He opposed the tendency to completely separate the issue of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes from the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons. He said that the destructive power of atomic energy cannot be forgotten. The Soviet Union's attitude in this regard is entirely understandable. He emphasized that the major powers should work in complete agreement to prevent the possibility of using atomic energy for destructive purposes.

    就原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题
    维辛斯基在联大政委会上发言
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论在发展原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作的问题。在十一月十二日下午会议上联合国大会政治委员会听取了苏联代表团团长维辛斯基关于在发展原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作的问题的发言。
    苏联代表在发言的开头叙述了俄国和苏联科学家在发展核子物理学和有关科学部门方面所起的作用和苏联把原子能和放射性物质应用于工业、农业、生物和医学方面的情况。维辛斯基说，苏联第一个原子能发电站的发电就是把原子能用于和平用途方面的最重要的步骤。这个拥有五千瓩可使用的发电能力的世界上第一个原子能发电站是在一九五四年六月二十七日在苏联开始发电，并把电流供应给工业和农业的。苏联科学家目前正在研究一些发电能力达五万到十万瓩的原子能发电站的建设工程。
    由于拥有大规模生产原子能的一切机会，苏维埃国家深感兴趣的是把这种新型的能只用于和平用途、只用来为人民谋福利，因为原子能的这种应用不仅在我们国家面前，而且还在一切准备执行把原子能用于和平用途的大规模计划的爱好和平的国家的面前，开辟了大大提高生产力、发展技术和文化以及增加国家财富的远景。
    因此，苏联坚决主张只把原子能用于和平用途，同时力求使苏联人民和所有关心和平和防止新世界大战危险的其他各国人民的和平劳动免受威胁，就是十分自然的了。
    维辛斯基谈到西方认为只有经过二十年以后原子能发电站才能“在商业上有利可图”的悲观论调时说：一方面是储存核子武器的政策，一方面是和把原子能用于和平用途在目前无利可图的情况有关的商业考虑和利益，这二者毫无疑问对西方国家实行大规模把原子能用于和平用途的计划造成了巨大的障碍。
    维辛斯基说，苏联政府认为，将在各国间的相应协议的基础上建立的处理把原子能用于和平用途问题的国际机构，只有不把它的大得足以使它能够胜利地执行它的任务的权力同时用来危害这个或那个国家的安全时，它才能胜利地执行任务。维辛斯基指出：苏联代表团曾要求洛奇就美国目前的减少这个国际机构对联合国大会和安全理事会所承担的责任的建议作某种澄清。洛奇的答复——虽然是闪烁其辞的——无疑地表明，美国正在设法阻挠安全理事会参加这个问题的解决。洛奇先生谈到将由一项类似联合国与各专门机构——它们与联合国大会的联系是很弱的，而与安全理事会的联系则更弱——间的协议的那种协议把这个国际机构和联合国联系起来；这种说法是与苏联九月二十二日的备忘录中提出的原则相抵触的。维辛斯基提醒代表们说：联合国大会一九四六年一月二十四日一致通过的决议规定：当时成立的考虑因原子能的发现而产生的问题的委员会应向安全理事会提出它的报告和建议，并把这些报告和建议公开发表，除非安全理事会为了和平与安全的利益而作出相反的决定。这个决议说，这个委员会应就所有这些问题向安全理事会提出它的工作报告。
    因此，从上述决议看来，和一九四六年建立的委员会有着类似职权的委员会同目前提议的处理把原子能用于和平用途问题的国际机构之间必须存在的关系已没有丝毫疑问。
    维辛斯基着重指出把原子能用于和平用途的问题同裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题之间的密切关系。他在他的发言中表示，若干代表在政治委员会关于这个问题的发言中已承认了这种关系的存在。
    苏联代表团团长追述说，在大会上届会议上，这两个问题也被认为是有密切关系的。
    他提醒代表们说，在一九四六年一月大会举行第一届会议时就一致通过了一项决议，授权一个专门委员会来草拟关于在把原子能专用于和平用途所必需的规模上来控制原子能的建议，并草拟一个从国家军备中取消原子武器的建议。
    苏联代表指出，把原子能用于和平用途不但不排斥储存原子武器的可能性，而且，在某种情况下，甚至还能促进这种储存，因此苏联政府才坚持主张采取无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器的措施，或者采取导向这个目标的第一个重要步骤，无条件放弃这种武器的使用的措施。
    维辛斯基接着说，我们已经表示，各国就无条件放弃原子武器的使用，作为走向完全禁止原子武器并从国家军备中取消原子武器的一个重要步骤取得协议，对于迅速执行苏联政府所建议的公约中所提出的各种措施有着极重要的意义。同时我们在我们一九五四年九月三十日的提案中表示，执行这些建议中提出的计划并不以达成上述协议为条件。苏联在关于参加把原子能用于和平用途的国际协议和参加为此目的而成立的国际机构的问题上也是采取同一立场。
    维辛斯基继续说，苏联热烈地赞成把原子能用于和平用途的主张。
    苏联认为同时有必要继续谋求利用原子能问题的根本解决，如果这个问题没有根本解决就不能保证原子能不被用于制造原子武器。
    苏联政府确信，就在发展原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作问题达成协议的可能性绝对没有探寻殆尽。
    但是，苏联政府深信，这方面的国际合作只有建筑在下面这样的原则的基础上才能是有效的。这些原则应该排斥任何利用这种合作去侵犯一些国家的合法利益的可能性，这些原则应该规定任何关于在发展原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作的协议不应该使某一个国家或某一些国家处于一种能够把自己的意志强加于其他国家的特权地位。
    维辛斯基指出，美国力图削弱提议成立的机构同联合国大会和安全理事会之间的联系，这种行动是违反这些原则的。维辛斯基说，不仅如此，“七国”提案包括的一些条款实际上已经预先规定了这个国际机构的性质。虽然这个问题还要在美国已经表示愿意和苏联进行的关于和组织应用原子能于和平用途的国际机构有关的问题的谈判中加以考虑。
    我们认为，必须使七国提案符合于上述的一些事实，而那些实际上预先规定了这个国际机构的性质的条款必须从这个提案中删去。
    维辛斯基提请政治委员会注意这一事实：美国洛奇先生所提出的建议从一九五四年三月十九日的美国备忘录和艾森豪威尔总统在一九五三年十二月八日发表的演说大大地退后了一步，因为这些建议缩小了在把原子能用于和平用途方面的国际合作的规模。这也是从总统的演说中提到的减少“世界原子储藏的潜在毁灭力”的计划退后了一步，而在目前的美国建议和七国提案中没有提到这个计划。而且这也是从以前的建议规定了的对落后国家的技术和经济援助方面退后了一步，最近提出的提案中找不到这一点。
    维辛斯基最后说，苏联支持在发展原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作的原则。苏联一向坚决主张，目前仍然坚决主张进行这种合作和把原子能用于和平目的。
    至于七国提案，苏联代表团必需指出，它有许多重大的缺点：它限制国际机构和国际公约的参加者的数目，并规定建立一个专门机构式的而不是一个联合国机构式的国际机构。这种缺点阻碍了在原子能和平用途方面进行国际合作的发展。苏联代表团还认为同这方面的国际合作有关的许多问题需要在有关国家以后举行谈判时加以考虑。我们代表团打算在七国提案中包含的具体建议提出来讨论时再来谈这个问题。
    维辛斯基的发言引起了代表、公众和报界的很大兴趣。
    在维辛斯基发言后，美国代表洛奇发言攻击大国一致原则。
    在九日至十二日连日讨论中，许多国家代表发言。瑞典代表表示对七国提案有若干重大的保留。他支持苏联在同美国就把原子能用于和平用途进行谈判时所提出的论点：为了防止把可分裂物质用于战争用途，必须要有某种保证。他赞成联合国和建议中的国际机构有更密切的联系。
    埃及代表说，没有苏联参加，把原子能用于和平用途的整个计划就不能充分有效。
    南非代表要求一切有关国家努力就目前讨论的问题取得全面协议。
    丹麦代表指出，七国提案没有涉及裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题，丹麦政府和人民将欢迎这个问题得到解决。
    南斯拉夫代表强调指出必须利用原子能来发展落后国家的国民经济。他表示相信由于委员会一致通过裁军提案，就讨论中的问题达成协议的希望也增加了。
    叙利亚代表更加有力地着重指出，必须就这个问题作出一致的、能使一切直接有关方面接受的决定。他反对将把原子能用于和平用途问题完全和禁止原子武器问题分开的倾向。他说，不能忘记原子能的破坏力量。苏联在这方面的态度是完全可以理解的。他强调大国应该意见完全一致地努力防止把原子能用于破坏用途的可能性。
