    The first session of the second meeting of the People's Representatives of the Henan Mongol Banner, Qinghai Province, was held from October 16th to 21st. The meeting acted on behalf of the People's Congress and formally established the People's Government of the Henan Mongol Autonomous Banner. The meeting elected Zaxi Cairang (female, Mongol) as Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and Guo Shuhua (Han), Langji (Mongol), Laha Cang (Mongol), and Gongbao Zaxi (Mongol) as Vice Chairmen. Thirty-six government members were elected. The meeting also approved a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.
    The representatives attending the meeting conscientiously studied the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and determined the future tasks of the autonomous region.
    When the Autonomous Region People's Government was established, more than 1,500 people held ethnic-style entertainment activities such as horse racing and shooting to celebrate the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government.
    The Henan Mongol Autonomous Banner Autonomous Region is equivalent to a county-level autonomous region, located in southeastern Qinghai Province. The entire autonomous region has a population of more than 12,000, with abundant water and grass, and the people are mainly engaged in animal husbandry production.
    After the establishment of the Henan Mongol Autonomous Banner in Qinghai Province, ethnic regional autonomy governments have now been established in all areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in Qinghai Province. (Xinhua News Agency)
