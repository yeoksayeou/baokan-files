Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 18th: The Tu Li River, Yi Tu Li River, Xi Ni Qi, and Bo Ke Tu four forest industry bureaus in the Greater Khingan Range forest area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have completed their annual timber production plans ahead of schedule. The annual plans for remitted profits and cost reductions were also completed simultaneously. In cost reduction alone, the four forest industry bureaus saved the state 11.69 billion yuan.

The timber production tasks of the four forest industry bureaus account for more than 70% of the production tasks in the Greater Khingan Range forest area. The forestry workers are in high spirits to support the country's economic construction. In the continuous labor emulation drive, the workers of the Yi Tu Li River forest area exceeded the annual plan in the third quarter. This year, over 1,500 workers in these four forest areas launched the first summer logging operation in history during the rainy season in the Greater Khingan Range. They overcame the summer heat of the Greater Khingan Range, creating conditions for completing the annual task. In transportation operations, many new Soviet machines were added this year, and hundreds of workers learned to master the technology of these new machines, playing a significant role.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 18th: Timber felled from the Greater Khingan Range forest area of Inner Mongolia is being shipped southward in large quantities. This timber is mainly used as pit props to support the increased production needs of many coal mines across the country. Coal mines require a large amount of timber as supports underground to ensure safety during production.

Since the beginning of this year, the Greater Khingan Range forest area has supplied various coal mines with thousands of train cars of pit props. In order to meet the needs of increased coal production in winter, the forest area workers have recently formulated a plan to increase the production of pit props. By the end of this year, they will supply more than twice as many pit props to various coal mines as last year. The forest area workers are currently implementing a "zoning and fixed-point" production method to increase timber production and tailor the timber specifications to the different needs of various coal mines. The loading and unloading workers at the Tu Li River forest area storage yard are implementing a "pit prop classification and stacking" method, which has increased the loading capacity. The daily loading capacity per person has increased from 23 cubic meters to 27 cubic meters, enabling a large number of pit props to be transported smoothly.

    大兴安岭林区四个森林工业局
    提前完成全年木材生产计划
    【新华社呼和浩特十八日电】内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区的图里河、伊图里河、西尼其和博克图四个森林工业局，已提前完成了全年木材生产计划。上缴利润和降低成本的全年计划也同时完成。其中仅降低成本一项，四个森林工业局就给国家节省了一百一十六亿九千万元。
    四个森林工业局的木材生产任务占大兴安岭林区生产任务的百分之七十以上。林业工人们为支援祖国经济建设，劳动情绪很高。伊图里河林区的工人们，在持续的劳动竞赛中，第三季度就超额完成了全年计划。这四个林区，今年有一千五百多名工人，在大兴安岭的雨季，展开了历史上第一次的夏季采伐作业，他们战胜了大兴安岭的暑热，为完成全年任务创造了条件。在运搬作业中，今年新增加了许多苏联新机器，几百名工人学会掌握了这些新机器的技术，发挥了很大作用。
    【新华社呼和浩特十八日电】由内蒙古大兴安岭林区砍伐下来的木材，正大批地向南启运。这些木材主要是用作坑木来支援全国许多煤矿的增产需要的。煤矿在进行生产时，矿井下面需要大量木材作为支柱，以保证安全。
    大兴安岭林区今年以来，曾以几千火车皮的坑木源源供应各地煤矿生产。为了满足煤矿冬季增产的需要，林区工人最近又订出了增产坑木的计划。到今年年底，他们为各地煤矿供应的坑木将要比去年增加一倍以上。林区工人们目前正在实行“分区定点”的生产办法，以提高木材产量，并使木材的规格适合于各地煤矿的不同需要。图里河林区贮木场装卸工人们实行“坑木分级归楞”的办法，提高了装车量，每人每天的装车量由二十三立方公尺提高到二十七立方公尺，使大批坑木能够顺利地调运出去。
