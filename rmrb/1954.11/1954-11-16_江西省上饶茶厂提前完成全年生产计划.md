The Raohe Tea Factory of the state-owned Jiangxi Provincial Tea Company has overfulfilled this year's production plan ahead of schedule on October 15th. The output completed 108.94% of the plan, and the output value completed 119.12% of the plan. The factory's processed black tea was completely shipped out of the factory on October 17th.

Since June of this year, the factory has launched a labor competition focusing on technological innovation and has achieved some results. Workers Hu Wenhui, Huang Rongfu, and others collectively researched and improved the semi-automated combined machine, which can save one and a half man-days per day. Labor model Zhu Zhengwang improved the tea outlet of the flat circular sieve machine, increasing production efficiency by more than 11%. Worker Ding Lichao created an automatic scraper for the roller circular sieve machine, which not only replaced manual labor but also increased output by 1,250 catties per day. Technological innovation has brought the factory's labor competition to a new stage, greatly improving labor productivity. This year, the factory used only 3 hours and 42 minutes to produce one dan of tea, which is 23.44% lower than the state quota.

    江西省上饶茶厂提前完成全年生产计划
    国营江西省茶业公司上饶茶厂，已在十月十五日提前超额完成了今年生产计划。产量完成计划百分之一○八·九四，产值完成计划百分之一一九·一二。今年该厂加工的正茶，已于十月十七日全部调运出厂。
    该厂自今年六月份起，展开了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，取得了一些成绩。工人胡文辉、黄荣富等集体研究改进了半自动化的联合机，每天可节省一个半人工。劳动模范朱政旺改进了平式圆筛机的出茶口，提高了生产效率百分之十一强。工人丁利潮在滚筒圆筛机上，创造了一个自动刮筛片，不但代替了手工劳动，每天还可增加产量一千二百五十斤。技术革新使该厂劳动竞赛走向新阶段，大大提高了劳动生产率。该厂今年制一担茶仅合三时四十二分，比较国家定额降低了百分之二三·四四。　　　　　　　　　　　　（章若慎）
