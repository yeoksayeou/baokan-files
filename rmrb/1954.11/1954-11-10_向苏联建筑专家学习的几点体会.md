Some Experiences Learned from Soviet Architectural Experts
Engineer, Central Industrial and Urban Architectural Design Institute, Zhou Yongyuan

The Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai are two magnificent buildings. Their construction was carried out under the personal design of Soviet architects Andreyev, a Stalin Prize winner, architect Gisnova, and structural engineer Gokhman, a Stalin Prize winner, and with the joint efforts of Chinese architects and engineers. These two buildings demonstrate the achievements of the Soviet Union in architectural art and architectural science.

Our Chinese architects and engineers participated in the design work of these two projects and received specific guidance and assistance from Soviet experts. I deeply feel that the experts' design ideas, working methods, and working attitudes are all worth learning from.

In the past, the leadership often instructed us to master the three principles of "good, fast, and economical" in capital construction, whether in design or construction. However, we have never had a deep understanding of this instruction. This time, the experts instructed us, "In structural design, in addition to ensuring that the structure has sufficient strength and stability, we must also consider the interests of the country, master the three principles of saving materials, saving labor, and making construction convenient." The experts' instructions made our understanding of the spirit of "good, fast, and economical" more concrete and clear. In structural design, the "good" principle we mastered, as the experts said, is to ensure that the structure has sufficient strength and stability. However, the experts did not propose this principle in parallel with "economical" and "fast." He made it very clear to us that ensuring the structure's solidity and safety should be the premise of considering design principles.

The experts pointed out that it is necessary to ensure that the structure has "sufficient" strength and stability. Our past understanding of the meaning of "sufficient" was incomplete. Although whether the strength and stability are sufficient needs to be determined based on the designer's technical ability, in the projects we designed in the past, to a large extent, it was due to the designer's conservative thinking, liberalism, and irresponsible attitude towards the interests of the country that a structure was often designed to be overly strong, resulting in a great waste of the country's financial and material resources. For example, we once designed a three-story building project. Some people advocated pile driving, while others believed that pile driving was not enough and the foundation should be designed as reinforced concrete. Some people thought that adding some steel bars to the brick walls would be better. As a result, all the methods that could be thought of were used. When we showed this well-designed drawing to the expert, he thought it was completely unnecessary to do so much processing. Those extra strength would cause a waste of the country's financial and material resources. Due to conservative thinking, we only thought it was "safe" to put it on during design; but we adopted an irresponsible liberal attitude towards state property. What a great lesson this gave us.

When considering the strength and stability of structures, we used to be limited to the strength calculation of individual components such as beams, slabs, and columns, and believed that structural design was mainly the calculation of these components. Apart from this, there was nothing remarkable to do. However, the experts believe that these calculations are only a very small part of the entire structural design work. The main work should be to regard the entire structure as a whole and consider its strength and stability, because if the overall strength and stability of the structure are not enough, then the strength of each component will not be of much use. Because we did not pay attention to the overall strength and stability of the structure in the past, and thought that the soil pressure resistance in Shanghai was very low, it was necessary to drive piles to build higher houses. However, after the experts conducted on-site investigations and research, they pointed out that the soil pressure resistance is low, and building settlement is inevitable. What buildings fear is uneven settlement. We only need to ensure that the building itself has sufficient overall strength and stability to resist uneven settlement. Therefore, in the construction of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai this time, we did not adopt the method of pile driving, but adopted the method of appropriately strengthening the rigidity of the structure. At the same time, the soil pressure resistance was not calculated according to the usual method of 5 to 8 tons per square meter in Shanghai, but according to 12 tons or more per square meter. For example, the central hall used a box foundation. This foundation has great rigidity, and a brick wall load-bearing structure was designed in the two wing parts, and the brick walls were connected vertically and horizontally to increase rigidity, which can avoid uneven settlement, and save materials and labor, and construction is convenient.

Considering the rigidity of the entire structure is not only to resist uneven settlement, but also to resist horizontal wind force. In the past, when considering the wind force impact of high-rise buildings, we often mechanically determined that all the columns and beams of the structure should bear the wind force. The experts believe that this is inappropriate. Because the rigidity of the column is very small, if you want to increase the rigidity of the column, you need to put a lot of steel bars, and the deformation will be very large. He believes that when the impact of wind force is great, it is appropriate to consider using reinforced concrete walls to bear the wind force. For example, in the structure of the central hall of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, which is more than 100 meters high, four reinforced concrete walls were designed using the parts without window and door openings in the four corners, so that the wind force is borne by these four corner walls, and all the remaining columns of the building do not need to consider the impact of wind force. In this way, a lot of steel bars to strengthen the rigidity of the columns were also saved.

From the above examples, we can see that structural design must consider that the structure has sufficient strength and stability. The experts emphasized that saving materials, saving labor, and making construction convenient are the three principles of design work, which is correct. He made it very clear to us that structural design is mainly to use the most economical materials, the least labor, and the most convenient construction methods to achieve the required strength and stability of the structure.

In terms of saving materials, when considering this principle, the experts did not simply consider the amount of materials used, but more importantly, to properly select and use materials from the perspective of the interests of the entire country. The experts believe that our country is in a period of transition, and the current main task is to concentrate efforts to realize national industrialization. Therefore, some materials, such as steel, cement, non-ferrous metals, etc., should be used less or not at all in civil buildings. He believes that some buildings, such as office buildings, dormitories, etc., even if they are seven or eight stories high, should adopt a brick wall load-bearing structure instead of a reinforced concrete frame structure. For example, the copper sheet used in expansion joints is not only needed in industry, but also in national defense. Therefore, in general buildings, other materials should be used instead. In the past, we only knew how to save materials, but we were not clear enough about why we should save materials and from which aspects we should save materials.

Saving labor is one of the characteristics of socialist design thinking. In the design work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, in order to reduce heavy physical labor, the experts used mechanical installation as much as possible under the existing conditions. For example, for the steel tower on the top of the central hall, if we followed our usual construction methods, built scaffolding on the roof, and then installed the various parts of the steel tower on the spot from bottom to top, I don’t know how much labor it would take. According to our existing construction lifting capacity, the experts divided the tower into twenty-three sections, prefabricated them in the factory, and then welded the sections together in the central hall, and also prefabricated the various decorations on the tower in advance. Using simple lifting tools, the entire steel tower was quickly lifted from the hall to the roof.

Considering convenient construction and shortening construction time is also a major principle in socialist design thinking. In the past, the leadership called on us to be "fast", but we did not have a sufficient understanding of the meaning of fast, and even one-sidedly thought that the design should be fast and the drawings should be produced quickly, but we did not consider the more important thing is how to make the construction fast. Even because the design intention was not clear, the dimensions and practices were not clearly explained, the design was fast, but it added a lot of trouble to the construction. For the entire project, it was not only not fast, but slow. In order to facilitate the construction of the steel tower, the Soviet experts spent a lot of time designing the installation frame and the track for fixing the direction of the spire. During the design process of the Soviet Exhibition Center and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, the experts repeatedly pointed out to us that design should pay attention to the significance of convenience for construction. They often tried to unify the beams and columns with similar dimensions that we calculated as much as possible. For example, the longitudinal column spacing of the Soviet Exhibition Center is uniformly 8 meters, and the longitudinal column spacing of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building is uniformly 6 meters, so that the types are reduced as much as possible to avoid trouble in construction.

In order to make us more clearly understand the meaning of design for construction convenience, the experts specifically pointed out that construction drawings are mainly for construction services. Therefore, the drawing methods and dimension notations of all construction drawings must also start from the convenience of construction. For example, the drawings are classified according to the type of work, and the formwork plan is mainly for carpenters. All the dimensions needed by the carpenters are marked on this drawing, so that the carpenters can make the formwork just by looking at this drawing. You don't need to refer to other drawings, and even the pipe holes that need to be reserved on the formwork for the equipment are drawn on this drawing. In the past, we were not clear about the purpose of serving construction. We often did not mark the dimensions that construction needed most, but added the unnecessary dimension instructions. Soviet experts helped us with these extremely small things, and wanted us to care about the convenience of the work of the construction workers.

During this period of work, what makes us deeply feel is not only in design thinking and mastering design principles, we must learn from Soviet experts. Their hard work, creative labor attitude, their realistic working style and their highly responsible spirit are also our good examples.

Experts are never conservative and complacent. They believe that design work is an intellectual labor. Even when dealing with a small matter, they never do things sloppily. They repeatedly think about every problem in order to create a more perfect solution. When dealing with problems, they try their best to solve the problem realistically and in light of the specific situation. In design work, in order to thoroughly understand the situation of a certain problem, they not only understand from the problem itself, but also understand from the surrounding and from the side. In addition to looking at the plan view, they must also look at the sectional view and the elevation view, and sometimes even magnify a part of the details to a scale of one to ten to study. The experience of working with them for several months proves that it is indeed comprehensive to study and solve problems with this working method.

Their highly responsible and responsible spirit at work is even more worthy of our learning. In the past, we often thought that the responsibility of designers was limited to design drawings. As for future poor construction, or the resulting losses to the country, that was the responsibility of the construction party and had nothing to do with the designer. The experts believe that the purpose of design work is to build a good building, not just to produce a set of good-looking drawings. Therefore, designers cannot limit their responsibilities to design drawings. He also wants to help and supervise the construction unit to construct according to the design intention. Their responsible spirit for work is also reflected in their care for the country's financial and material resources. Whenever they find wasteful phenomena in our design, they often make strict criticisms. They often tell us that every worker should not only try to be economical in the part of the work they design, but also criticize when they see wasteful phenomena in the design of others.

The collectivism and overall viewpoint of Soviet experts are also worth learning. When dealing with every problem, they always seek our opinions and pay attention to giving play to everyone's collective strength. After the drawings are sent to the construction site, they also solicit the opinions of the workers in many aspects. The experts' overall viewpoint is prominently manifested in the close cooperation of the three types of work: architecture, structure, and equipment. The experts believe: "The quality of a building cannot be viewed separately from the three aspects of architecture, structure, and equipment. It must be good in all three aspects to be considered good. If one of them is not well designed, then this building cannot be regarded as a good design. No matter how good the other two types of work are designed, it is meaningless." Therefore, these three types of work must always maintain close contact and mutual cooperation.

From the design work of the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai, we deeply feel that the Soviet experts have provided immeasurable assistance to our Chinese architectural engineering and technical staff in architectural art, architectural science, as well as design thinking and technology. Now we would like to express to the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the Soviet experts our determination to earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and constantly improve our technical level and ideological level, so as to better serve the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

    向苏联建筑专家学习的几点体会
    中央工业及城市建筑设计院工程师　周永源
    北京的苏联展览馆和上海的中苏友好大厦，是两座宏伟的建筑物。它们的建筑工程，都是在苏联建筑师、斯大林奖金获得者安得列耶夫，建筑师吉斯诺娃，结构工程师、斯大林奖金获得者郭赫曼亲自设计和在中国的建筑师、工程师共同努力下进行的。这两座建筑物表现出苏联在建筑艺术和建筑科学上的成就。
    我们中国的建筑师和工程师参加了这两项工程的设计工作，得到了苏联专家的具体的指导和帮助。我深深地体会到专家们的设计思想、工作方法和工作态度都是很值得我们学习的。
    过去，领导上经常指示我们，在基本建设中，无论在设计方面，或者在施工方面，都要掌握“又好、又快、又要省”三个原则。但我们对这个指示精神一直体会不深。这次专家指示我们说：“在结构设计中，除了保证结构物有足够的强度和稳定性以外，还必须从国家利益着想，掌握节省材料、节省劳动力和做到使施工方便三个原则。”专家的这个指示，使我们对“好、快、省”的精神的领会更加具体和明确了。在结构设计中，我们所掌握的“好”的原则，正如专家所说的要保证结构物有足够的强度和稳定性。但专家不是把这一原则同“省”、“快”并列提出的。他很明确地告诉我们，要保证结构物有足够的强度和稳定性是结构设计中最起码的标准。保证结构物的坚固安全，应该是考虑设计原则的前提。
    专家指出，要保证结构物有“足够的”强度和稳定性。我们过去对“足够的”意义的体会是不全面的。虽然强度和稳定性的够与不够是需要根据设计者的技术能力来判断决定的，但是在我们过去所设计的工程中，在很大程度上是由于设计者的保守思想、自由主义和对国家利益不负责任的态度，把一个结构物往往设计得过分坚固，因而造成国家的财力物力很大的浪费。举一个例子来说：我们曾经设计过一项三层楼的房屋工程，有人主张打桩，有的人认为打桩还不够，应把基础设计成钢筋混凝土的，有的人认为在砖墙上再加一些钢筋更好一些，结果把所有能想到的办法都用上去了。我们把这个设计好的图样交给专家看了，他认为完全不必要做那末多的处理。那些多余的强度会造成国家财力物力上的浪费。由于保守思想作怪，我们在设计时只认为放上去“保险”一些；而对国家财产就采取了一种不负责任的自由主义态度。这给我们的教训是多么大啊。
    在考虑结构物的强度和稳定性的时候，我们过去常常局限于梁、板、柱等个别构件的强度计算上，认为结构设计主要的就是这些构件的计算工作，除此以外，就没有什么了不起的工作了。但是专家们认为，这些计算工作仅仅是整个结构设计工作中的极小的一部分工作，主要的工作应该是把整个结构物看作一个整体，来考虑它的强度和稳定性，因为假如结构物的整体的强度和稳定性不够，那末每一个构件的强度就没有多大作用。由于我们过去没有注意结构物整体的强度和稳定性，又以为上海土壤的耐压力很低，要造高一些的房子就非打桩不可。但专家实地调查研究以后，指出土壤耐压力低，建筑物沉降是免不了的。建筑物所怕的是不平均的沉降。我们只要做到能使建筑物本身有足够的整体的强度和稳定性，能够抵抗住不平均的沉降，就可以了。所以这次上海中苏友好大厦的建筑，我们没有采取打桩的办法，而是采取适当加强结构物的刚度的办法。同时对土壤耐压力，也没采用上海惯用的每平方公尺五至八吨的计算方法，而按每平方公尺十二吨以上来计算。例如中央大厅，就采用了一个箱型基础。这个基础有很大的刚度，并在两翼部分设计了砖墙承重结构，并把砖墙纵横相连，使刚性加大，可以避免不平均的沉降，而且节省材料和劳力，施工又方便。
    考虑整个结构物的刚性不单是为了抵抗不平均的沉降，同时也为了抵抗水平的风力。我们过去考虑高层建筑的风力影响时，往往机械地确定由结构所有的柱子和梁来承受风力。专家认为这样做是不适当的。因为柱子的刚性很小，要加大柱子的刚性，就要放很多的钢筋，同时变形还会很大。他认为当风力影响很大时，考虑用钢筋混凝土的墙去承受风力是合适的。例如上海中苏友好大厦的高达一百多公尺的中央大厅结构中，就是利用了四角没有窗户门孔的部分，设计了四面钢筋混凝土的墙，使风力都由这四面角墙来承受，建筑物其余所有的柱子，就可以不考虑到风力的影响。这样也就节省了很多加强柱子刚性的钢筋。
    从上述几个例子上，我们可以看出结构设计，是必须要考虑结构物有足够的强度和稳定性的。专家强调节省材料、节省劳动力、使施工方便是设计工作的三个原则，是正确的。他很明确地告诉我们，在结构设计中主要是用最省的材料，最少的劳动力，和最方便的施工方法来达到结构物所要求的强度和稳定性。
    在节省材料方面，专家在考虑这一原则时，并不是单纯地考虑使用材料的数量多少问题，而更重要的，是要从整个国家的利益出发，适当地选择与使用材料。专家认为我们国家正处在过渡时期，目前的主要任务是集中力量实现国家工业化，因而有些材料，像钢、水泥、有色金属等，民用建筑中就应考虑少用或不用。他认为有些建筑物，如办公用楼房、宿舍等，即使有七、八层高，亦应采用砖墙承重的结构，而不应用钢筋混凝土框架结构。又如伸缩缝中所用的铜片，不但工业上需要，国防上也需要，所以在一般的建筑物中，应该用其他材料代替。过去我们只知道节省材料，但对为什么节省材料，从那些方面节省材料，是不够明确的。
    节省劳动力是社会主义设计思想中特点之一。在设计中苏友好大厦的工作中，为了减少繁重的体力劳动，专家尽可能地在现有条件下使用了机械安装。例如中央大厅顶上的钢塔，如果按照我们平常施工办法，在屋顶上搭上脚手架子，然后再把钢塔的各部分由下而上地就地安装起来，不知要多花费多少劳动力。专家们根据我们现有的施工起重能力，把塔分成二十三节，在工厂里预先做好，然后再在中央大厅内把各节焊接起来，把塔上的各种装饰也一起事先做好，利用简单的起重工具，就很快地把整个钢塔自大厅升至屋顶。
    考虑施工方便，缩短施工时间，也是社会主义设计思想中的一个主要原则。过去领导上号召我们要“快”，但我们对快的意义认识不足，甚至只片面地认为设计要快，图纸要出得快，但没有考虑到更重要的是如何使施工快。甚至由于设计意图不明确，尺寸、做法交代不清楚，结果是设计是快了，却给施工添了很多麻烦，对整个工程来说，不仅没做快，反而慢了。苏联专家为了使安装钢塔施工方便，就曾花费了许多时间，设计了安装架子和固定尖塔方向用的轨道。在苏联展览馆和中苏友好大厦的设计过程中，专家们一再向我们指出设计要注意为施工方便的意义，他们常常把我们计算尺寸相近的梁、柱等能统一起来的尽量统一起来。比如苏联展览馆的纵向柱的间距一律采用八公尺，中苏友好大厦纵向柱的间距一律采用六公尺，使种类尽可能减少，以免除施工中的麻烦。
    为了使我们更能明确了解设计为施工方便的意义，专家们特别指出施工图纸主要是为施工服务的。因此一切施工图纸的画法和尺寸的注法，也都要从为施工方便出发。例如图样按工种分类，模板平面图主要是专为木工所用的，所有木工所需要的尺寸都在这图纸上注明，使木工们只要看了这一张图纸就能做出模板来，用不着再去参考旁的图纸，连设备所需要在模板上预留的管子洞也在这张图纸上画好。我们过去对为施工服务的目的是不明确的，往往把施工最需要的尺寸不注明，而把不需要的尺寸说明却加上了。苏联专家从这些极细小的事情上都来帮助我们，要我们关心施工工人们的工作方便。
    在这一段工作中，使我们深深感到的，不单在设计思想和掌握设计原则上，要向苏联专家们学习。他们的刻苦钻研创造性的劳动态度，他们实事求是的工作作风和对工作高度负责的精神，也同样是我们的好榜样。
    专家们决不保守自满。他们认为设计工作，是一种智力劳动。他们即使处理一件细小的事情，也从不草草了事，他们对每一个问题都反复思索，以求创造出更完善的办法去处理。他们处理问题，都尽可能地做到针对具体情况，实事求是地解决问题。在设计工作中，他们为了要彻底了解某一问题的情况，不单从问题本身进行了解，同时从周围，从侧面也进行了解，除了看平面图以外，他们一定还要看剖面图、立面图，有时甚至还要把某一部分的细节放大到十分之一的比例去研究，同他们一起工作几个月来的经验证明，用这样的工作方法去研究解决问题确乎是全面的。
    他们在工作中高度负责和负责到底的精神，更是值得我们学习的。我们过去往往认为设计工作者的责任只限于设计图纸，至于将来施工不良，或因而造成国家的损失，那是施工方面的责任，和设计者无关。专家们认为设计工作的目的是在建造一个好的建筑物，而不是只为了出一套好看的图纸。因之设计工作者就不能把自己的责任只限在设计图纸上。他还要帮助和监督施工单位按照设计意图施工。他们对工作的负责精神，还表现在对国家财力物力的爱护上，每当他们发现我们设计中有浪费现象的时候，往往提出严格的批评。他们常常告诉我们，每一个工作者不但要在本身设计的一部分工作中尽量做到节省，就是看到别人在设计中有浪费现象时，也应该给予批评。
    苏联专家们的集体主义和整体观点，也是值得我们学习的。在处理每一个问题时，他们总是要征求我们的意见，注意发挥大家的集体力量。当图样发到工地后，他们还要多方面地征求工人的意见。专家们的整体观点，突出地表现在建筑、结构、设备三个工种的密切配合上。专家们认为：“一个建筑物的好坏，不能把建筑、结构、设备三者分开来看，一定要三样都好才算好，假如其中有一种设计得不好，那末这个建筑物就不能算作一个好的设计，其余两个工种设计得再好也没有什么意义了”。因此，这三个工种必须经常保持密切的联系和互相配合。
    从北京的苏联展览馆和上海的中苏友好大厦工程的设计工作中，使我们深深感到苏联专家们在建筑艺术上、建筑科学上以及设计思想和技术上，给予我们中国的建筑工程技术工作人员的帮助，是不可限量的。现在我们谨向苏联政府、苏联人民、苏联专家表示，决心努力学习苏联的先进经验，不断提高我们的技术水平与思想水平，以便更好地为祖国的社会主义建设事业服务。
