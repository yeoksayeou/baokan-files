    The Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, held at the end of June this year, summarized the first Five-Year Plan (1948-1953) for the development of the national economy of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    The first long-term construction plan, known by the Czechoslovak working people as the Gottwald Five-Year Plan in memory of their unforgettable leader, Gottwald, was formulated shortly after the working class and working farmers won a complete victory over the reactionaries in February 1948. The purpose of this plan was to transform and build the Czechoslovak national economy according to the principles of socialist industrialization, and to build a strong industrial and raw material base to ensure the strength and independence of the country, the further development of the entire national economy, and the improvement of the people's living standards.

    The first Five-Year Plan period was a period of unprecedented mobilization of people's forces, a period of change for the masses of working farmers, a period of glorious constructive labor and inspiring progress.

    During this period, the class structure of the Czechoslovak economy underwent profound changes. In early 1948, although nationalization had been implemented, the capitalist component still accounted for one-fifth of the entire industry; after the people's victory, it accounted for only one-twentieth of the entire industry. The people's democratic system has also brought about significant changes in rural areas. In 1953, socialist components accounted for 43 percent of the country's cultivated land, while small production accounted for only 32 percent. This proves that in the people's democratic Czechoslovakia, most of the cultivated land has been mastered by those who work on the land. In 1949, there were only 35 unified agricultural cooperatives in the country, while during the Five-Year Plan period, small and middle farmers were organized. In 1954, 47 percent of the country's rural areas had unified agricultural cooperatives. They cultivate 33 percent of the country's cultivated land. During the Five-Year Plan period, trade also underwent major changes. Before 1948, most of the trade was in the hands of capitalists. If the private sector in the total sales of goods accounted for 68.7 percent in 1948, then in 1953, the proportion of socialist components in the total sales of goods had reached 99.5 percent.

    This national mobilization, linked to the concentration of funds in the socialist sector, has brought significant results. It took the bourgeoisie nearly 150 years to reach the industrial level of 1937. In the people's democratic Czechoslovakia, this level was exceeded more than twofold during the first Five-Year Plan period alone. In the last year of the first Five-Year Plan, electricity production increased twofold compared to 1937, brown coal increased by 91 percent, and steel increased by 90 percent. During the Five-Year Plan period, steam turbine production increased by 3.6 times, hydraulic presses increased by two times, household washing machines increased by nearly 19 times, furniture increased by four and a half times, silk fabrics increased by 67 percent, and so on. Significant achievements have also been made in starting the production of aluminum and the mining of pyrite. In this way, the independence of our economy has been consolidated and is no longer dependent on imports.

    Thanks to the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the creative application of the advanced experience of Soviet production innovators, great progress has been made in improving technology and starting the production of new products.

    During the Five-Year Plan period, many new, mainly powerful processing lathes and welding machines were produced, such as: rotary lathes that can process parts with a diameter of up to 5 meters and a weight of up to 120 tons, high-speed cutting lathes that can process parts weighing up to 200 tons and more than 15 meters long, and huge presses with a pressure of 12,000 tons, which can press forgings weighing up to 200 tons. For lifting and digging work, multi-bucket excavators have been designed that can fill a 23 cubic meter car in less than two minutes, replacing the labor of 1,000 people. Many new, highly rationalized machines for the textile industry, complex statistical and computers have also been produced, and mass production of measuring, physical, optical and medical instruments and apparatus has begun. For example, the precision balances produced in our country are first-class in the world.

    Czechoslovakia was one of the most industrially developed countries before World War II. However, its national economy, like the national economy of all capitalist countries, was constantly threatened by crises and recessions. The period of the people's democratic system is a period of economic upsurge. Industrial production in 1953 increased by nearly one and a half times per capita compared to 1937, greatly exceeding Belgium or the Netherlands, and almost twice as much as Italy (per capita). In 1953, Czechoslovakia's coal mining volume per capita ranked ninth in the world, and steel production ranked sixth in the world.

    During the first Five-Year Plan period, the production of means of production increased by about 119 percent, while the production of consumer goods increased by about 80 percent. The rapid growth in the production of means of production has created the preconditions for the development of all other sectors of the national economy and the gradual transformation of small-scale agricultural production into mechanized, large-scale socialist agricultural production.

    The achievements made by the Czechoslovak working class's love of labor and selfless actions fully demonstrate the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's theory of socialist industrialization.

    In agriculture, during the Five-Year Plan period, the total production of crops increased by 12.4 percent, primarily due to increased yields per unit area. For example, grain production increased by 21 percent, and potato production increased by 13 percent. The production of commercial meat has increased as follows since 1948: cattle - 45 percent, pigs - 202 percent; milk production increased by 26 percent. Machine tractor stations plowed 49 percent of the country's cultivated land in 1953 and harvested 35 percent of the country's grain.

    Foreign trade plays a huge role in changing the structure of the Czechoslovak national economy. The total volume of foreign trade increased by one-sixth during the Five-Year Plan period, of which the share of people's democratic countries increased from 32 percent in 1948 to 78 percent in 1953. In Czechoslovakia's export trade, the proportion of machinery in exports is constantly growing. Its proportion in the total export volume increased from 4.5 percent in 1929 to 22.9 percent in 1948, and then to 40 percent in 1953.

    The reason why the national economy was able to have such a comprehensive and rapid upsurge during the first Five-Year Plan period is primarily due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity. For example, labor productivity in the industrial sector alone increased by 60 percent compared to 1948. Pre-war Czechoslovakia often faced the problem of unemployment, while under the people's democratic system, the problem of absorbing labor into industrial production has become an important issue in the rapid advancement of the national economy. Many staff members who were originally in the agricultural and trade sectors have transferred to work in the industrial sector. Many new factories have been built, which guarantee the work of those who relied on begging and wandering abroad in the states that were backward during the capitalist period.

    Construction projects also increased by about 130 percent during the Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, the degree of mechanization of major construction work has been greatly improved. In 1953, 80 percent of the earthmoving work on construction sites was mechanized. The degree of mechanization of concrete mixing work is almost 100 percent. In the past, whenever a huge construction project was completed or entered the winter, construction workers would be cut back, while in 1953, 18 percent of the construction projects throughout the year were carried out in the winter.

    The achievements made by the national economy during the Five-Year Plan period have created the preconditions for simultaneously improving the people's living standards.

    The monetary reform implemented in mid-1953 deprived the remnants of the exploiting classes of their funds. In addition, the rationing system was completely abolished and price reductions were implemented several times. The largest price reduction was on April 1, 1954. The three price reductions implemented in the past year have saved residents 10.7 billion crowns (Czechoslovak currency) throughout the year. The price of living expenses - such as electricity and gas bills, as well as fees in the local transportation system, etc., are now much lower than before the war. Now 97 percent of the country's villages have been electrified. All villages in Czechoslovakia have been equipped with telephones. The mortality rate from infectious diseases has decreased by 43 percent compared to 1948, and by 59 percent compared to 1937. Now there is one doctor for every 760 people, while in 1937 there was one doctor for every 1,218 people.

    The number of primary, secondary and higher education institutions has also increased significantly. During the Five-Year Plan period, more than 20,000 kinds of books were published, with a total circulation of 333 million copies. Literature, film, music, fine arts and architecture have all developed. Czechoslovak science has also had new development. The center of scientific activity is the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, which inherits the progressive legacy of Czech and Slovak scholars for hundreds of years.

    Along with the improvement of living standards and cultural development, the needs of the working people have also grown. And they demand that these needs be better met. Demands for high-quality consumer goods and the development and improvement of public utility services have also increased.

    In a decree issued in September 1953, the Czechoslovak government instructed all working people to more resolutely complete the task of systematically improving the people's living standards on the basis of the achievements already obtained in the transformation and construction of the national economy.

    A strong industrial base provides the possibility of greatly expanding the production of consumer goods and rapidly improving agricultural production - especially livestock production. Short-term plans have been drawn up to increase agricultural production in the next two or three years. This plan will greatly increase the enthusiasm of state farm staff, unified agricultural cooperative members and those who are still individual farmers to this day.

    The effects of this policy are already showing. In the first half of 1954, the quantity of daily necessities sold to the people increased compared to the same period in 1953: textiles increased by 30 percent, shoes and boots - 18 percent; building materials - 100 percent; butter - 44 percent; sugar - 20 percent, and so on. At the same time, the quality of products has been improved and the scope of public utility services has been expanded. The Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party fully affirmed the correctness of the policy implemented by the state when summarizing the achievements, and at the same time sharply and openly criticized the shortcomings that occurred in industry, agriculture, transportation and state administrative organs. It gave instructions for the entire national economic work in 1955.

    The main way to develop the national economy in Czechoslovakia in 1955 is to create the preconditions for further improving the people's living standards by rapidly increasing production and strictly saving. The means of production and consumer goods should have the same growth in 1955. The entire national economy is faced with the task of improving labor productivity, and in achieving this goal, should mainly rely on improving labor organization, better mobilizing the potential of workers in industry, continuing to reduce production expenses by 4 percent, reduce raw material consumption by 5 percent, and reduce fuel and electricity consumption by 10 percent.

    In 1955, the personal consumption level of residents will be improved. The number of completed houses will increase by 20 percent compared to the 1954 plan, health care and cultural work will be further expanded, and the continued construction of schools will be guaranteed.

    Investment will be concentrated on the expansion of fuel, electricity and mineral bases, and a large amount of funds will be guaranteed for the development of agriculture, housing and public utilities.

    Agricultural production, mainly livestock production, will increase significantly. In order to guarantee the upsurge of agricultural production, the degree of mechanization of agriculture will be improved and the supply of artificial fertilizers will be increased.

    Foreign trade will play a significant role in completing the tasks of 1955. The task facing foreign trade is to expand economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and at the same time increase the trade volume with capitalist countries. Czechoslovakia's industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, guarantees to supply high-quality products for foreign trade.

    Completing these huge tasks requires further improving the level of leadership in all national economic sectors and in state organs, implementing the one-leader system in enterprises, and improving the political level of staff members in national economic organs and state organs.

    The Czechoslovak people are carrying out new tasks, and they are determined to overcome all difficulties and guarantee the further proportional development of the national economy, thereby improving their living standards.

    捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的全面高涨
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局候补委员
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国国家计划委员会主席  奥·西穆涅克
    今年六月底举行的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会，对捷克斯洛伐克共和国第一个国民经济发展五年计划（一九四八—一九五三年）作出了总结。
    为纪念自己永志不忘的领袖——哥特瓦尔德而被捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民称为哥特瓦尔德五年计划的第一个长期建设计划，是在工人阶级和劳动农民于一九四八年二月对反动派取得彻底胜利以后不久制订的。这个计划的目的，是按照社会主义工业化的原则来改造和建设捷克斯洛伐克的国民经济，建设强大的工业和原料基地，以保证国家的力量和独立，保证整个国民经济的进一步发展和人民生活水平的提高。
    第一个五年计划时期是人民力量空前动员的时期，是劳动农民群众发生变化的时期，是光荣的建设性劳动和令人鼓舞的时期。
    在这个时期内，捷克斯洛伐克经济的阶级结构发生了深刻的变化。在一九四八年初，虽然实行了国有化，资本主义成分却仍占整个工业的五分之一；而在人民胜利以后，它只占整个工业的二十分之一了。人民民主制度也使农村发生了显著的变化。在一九五三年，社会主义成分已占全国耕地的百分之四十三，而小生产则只占百分之三十二。这证明，在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克，大部分耕地已掌握在那些在土地上劳作着的人们的手里了。一九四九年全国只有三十五个统一农业合作社，而在五年计划时期，小农和中农都已组织起来了。一九五四年，全国百分之四十七的农村都有了统一农业合作社。它们耕作着全国百分之三十三的耕地。在五年计划期间，贸易也发生了重大变化。一九四八年以前贸易的大部分是掌握在资本家手里的。如果商品销售总额中的私营部分在一九四八年占百分之六十八点七的话，那么在一九五三年，社会主义成分在商品销售总额中所占的比重已达百分之九十九点五。
    这种和集中资金于社会主义部门相联系的全国大动员，已带来了重大的结果。资产阶级用了将近一百五十年的时间才达到了一九三七年的工业水平。而在人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克，只在第一个五年计划期间就超过了这个水平一倍以上。在第一个五年计划的最后一年，电力生产较一九三七年增加了两倍，褐煤——百分之九十一；钢材——百分之九十。在五年计划期间，蒸汽透平生产增加了三点六倍，水压机——两倍；家庭用洗衣机——几乎增加了十九倍；家具——四倍半；丝织品——增加了百分之六十七；等等。在开始铝的生产和黄铁矿的开采方面也获得了显著的成就。这样，我国经济的独立获得了巩固，已不依赖进口。
    由于苏联兄弟般的无私援助和创造性地运用苏联生产革新者的先进经验，在改进技术方面也有了很大的进展，并且开始了新产品的生产。
    在五年计划期间，出产了许多新的、主要是强大的加工车床和焊接机器，如：可以加工直径达五公尺、重量达一百二十吨的部件的旋转车床，可以加工重达二百吨、长达十五公尺余的部件的快速切削车床，以及压力达一万二千吨的巨大的压榨机，这种机器可以压榨重达二百吨的锻件。为了起重和挖土的工作，设计了多斗的挖土机，它能够在不到两分钟内装满体积达二十三立方公尺的车厢，代替一千个人的劳动。还出产了许多纺织工业用的、新的高度合理化的机器，复杂的统计与计算机，并开始大量生产测量、物理、光学与医疗器具和仪器，例如，我国出产的精密天平在世界上是第一流的。
    捷克斯洛伐克早在第二次世界大战以前就是工业高度发展的国家之一。但是，它的国民经济和所有资本主义国家的国民经济一样，是经常处在危机和不景气的威胁之下的。人民民主制度的时期是经济高涨的时期。工业生产在一九五三年按人口平均计算比一九三七年增加了近一倍半，大大地超过比利时或荷兰，并且几乎比意大利（按人口平均计算）的工业生产多两倍。一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克的石炭开采量按人口平均计算已占世界的第九位，钢产量占世界第六位。
    在第一个五年计划期间，生产资料的生产大约增加了百分之一百一十九，而日用品的生产则增加了约百分之八十。生产资料生产的迅速增长，为所有其他国民经济部门的发展和把小农生产逐渐改变为机械化的、大规模的社会主义农业生产创造了先决条件。
    捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级的爱好劳动和忘我的行动所获得的成就，充分证明了列宁、斯大林关于社会主义工业化理论的正确性。
    农业方面，在五年计划期间，农作物的生产总量增加了百分之十二点四，这首先是由于提高了单位面积产量。例如，谷物产量提高了百分之二十一，马铃薯产量提高了百分之十三。商品肉类的生产从一九四八年以来增加如下：牛——百分之四十五，猪——百分之二百零二；牛奶产量增加了百分之二十六。机器拖拉机站在一九五三年翻耕了全国百分之四十九的耕地，收割了全国百分之三十五的谷物。
    对外贸易在改变捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的结构方面起着巨大的作用。对外贸易总量在五年计划期间增加了六分之一，其中对人民民主国家的份额从一九四八年的百分之三十二增加到一九五三年的百分之七十八。在捷克斯洛伐克的出口贸易中，机器在输出品中的比重不断增长。它在输出总额中所占的比例，从一九二九年的百分之四点五增加到一九四八年的百分之二十二点九，而到一九五三年则增加到百分之四十。
    国民经济在第一个五年计划期间之所以能有如此全面的迅速的高涨，首先是由于劳动生产率的不断提高。例如，仅仅在工业部门中劳动生产率就比一九四八年增加了百分之六十。战前的捷克斯洛伐克经常面临着失业问题，而在人民民主制度之下，吸收劳动力参加工业生产的问题已经成为在国民经济大踏步前进中的一个重要问题了。许多原来在农业和贸易部门中的工作人员都转入了工业部门工作。已经建设了许多新的工厂，它们保证了在资本主义时期落后的各州里那些靠求乞为生的和流浪国外的人们的工作。
    建筑工程在五年计划期间也增加了约百分之一百三十。同时，主要建筑工作的机械化程度已大大地提高。一九五三年，建筑现场上的运土工作已有百分之八十机械化了。混凝土搅拌工作的机械化程度已几达百分之一百。在从前，每逢一件巨大建筑工程完工或进入冬季时，建筑工人就要被削减，而在一九五三年，全年建筑工程的百分之十八是在冬季施工的。
    国民经济在五年计划时期内所达到的成就，为同时提高人民的生活水平创造了先决条件。
    一九五三年中实行了货币改革，这就剥夺了那些剥削阶级残余分子手中的资金。此外，并完全废除了配给制度并数次实行了减价。其中最大的一次减价是在一九五四年四月一日。在最近一年内实行的三次减价，使居民全年节省了一百零七亿克朗（捷克斯洛伐克货币）。生活费用的价格——例如电力和煤气费以及地方运输系统中的费用等，今天都已比战前低得多了。现在全国乡村的百分之九十七都已电气化了。捷克斯洛伐克所有的村庄都已安装了电话。传染病的死亡率比一九四八年降低了百分之四十三，比一九三七年降低了百分之五十九。现在每七百六十人中有一个医生，而在一九三七年则一千二百一十八个人中才有一个医生。
    初级、中级和高等学校的数目也大大地增加了。在五年计划期间出版了二万种以上的书籍，销行总数达三亿三千三百万册。文学、电影、音乐、美术和建筑都有了发展。捷克斯洛伐克的科学也有了新的发展。科学活动的中心就是继承着捷克和斯洛伐克学者百年来进步遗产的捷克斯洛伐克科学院。
    与生活水平提高和文化发展的同时，劳动人民的需求也增长了。而且他们要求更好地满足这些需求。对于上等质量的消费品和发展与改善公用事业服务的要求也提高了。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府在一九五三年九月发布的法令中指示全体劳动人民，要在国民经济的改造和建设已获得的成就的基础上，更坚决地去完成有步骤地提高人民生活水平的任务。
    强大的工业基础为大大扩大消费品生产和迅速提高农业生产——首先是畜牧业生产提供了可能。已经拟订了在最近两、三年内提高农业生产的短期计划。这个计划将大大提高国营农场工作人员、统一农业合作社社员和那些直到今天为止还是个体农民的积极性。
    这一政策的效果已经显现出来了。在一九五四年上半年内，销售给人民的日用品数量比一九五三年同期增加了：纺织品增加了百分之三十，鞋靴——百分之十八；建筑材料——百分之一百；黄油——百分之四十四；糖——百分之二十，等等。同时也改善了产品的质量与扩大了公用事业的服务范围。捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会在总结成就时完全肯定了国家所实行的这一政策的正确性，同时也尖锐地、公开地批评了在工业、农业、运输和国家行政机构中所发生的缺点。它对一九五五年的整个国民经济工作作出了指示。
    捷克斯洛伐克一九五五年发展国民经济的主要途径是，通过迅速提高生产和严格节约的方法，来为进一步提高人民生活水平创造先决条件。生产资料和消费品在一九五五年内应有同样的增长。整个国民经济都面临着提高劳动生产率的任务，而在达到这一目的上，应主要依靠改善劳动组织，更好地动员工业中工人的潜力，要继续减少生产开支百分之四，减少原料消耗百分之五，减少燃料和电力消耗百分之十。
    一九五五年内将提高居民的个人消费水平。落成的住宅数目将比一九五四年的计划增加百分之二十，将进一步扩大卫生保健和文化工作，保证继续兴建学校。
    投资将集中在燃料、电力和矿产基地的扩展，并为农业、住宅和公用事业的发展保证大量的资金。
    农业生产，主要是畜牧业的生产，将大大增长。为保证农业生产的高涨将提高农业的机械化程度，并增加人工肥料的供应。
    对外贸易在完成一九五五年的任务中将起显著的作用。对外贸易面临的任务是扩大和苏联与人民民主国家的经济合作，同时增加和资本主义国家的贸易额。捷克斯洛伐克的工业、特别是机器制造业，保证为对外贸易供给具有高度质量的生产品。
    完成这些巨大的任务需要进一步提高所有国民经济部门中的和国家机构中的领导工作水平，在企业中实行一长制，并提高国民经济机关和国家机关工作人员的政治水平。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民正在执行着新的任务，他们决心克服一切困难，并保证国民经济进一步按比例发展，从而提高自己的生活水平。
