    Beijing State-Owned Commercial Enterprises Exceed October Sales Plan
    Beijing's state-owned commercial system has exceeded its October sales plan. The city's nineteen state-owned commercial companies achieved an average of 100.71% of their October sales plan.
    In October, the state-owned commercial companies in Beijing successively launched labor competitions, which played a significant role in completing the sales plan. The companies not only expanded sales, but also improved labor efficiency and reduced operating and management expenses. The coal yard of the Dongdan District Business Office of the Beijing Retail Company improved the method of storing coal balls, saving a lot of reed mats. The salespersons of the Chaoyangmen, Guang'anmen, and Yongdingmen outlets of the China Salt Industry Company's Beijing branch systematically contacted users and implemented the method of delivering goods at the station, which not only saved transportation costs, but also reduced many warehouse entry and exit procedures.

    北京市国营商业十月份销售计划超额完成
    北京市国营商业系统十月份的销售计划已超额完成。全市十九个国营商业公司十月份销售计划平均完成百分之一百零点七一。
    十月份，北京市各国营商业公司先后开展了劳动竞赛，这对完成销售计划起了很大作用。各公司不仅扩大了销货额，而且提高了劳动效率，降低了经营管理费用。北京市零售公司东单区营业处煤厂，改进储存煤球的方法，节省了很多苇席。中国盐业公司北京支公司朝阳门、广安门和永定门门市部的营业员，有计划地联系用户，实行车站交货的办法，不仅节省了运输费用，并减少了许多出入仓库的手续。
