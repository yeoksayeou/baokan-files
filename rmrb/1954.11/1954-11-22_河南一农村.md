    A Village in Henan
    Li Zhun
    This village is called Sima Village, located at the foot of Langshan Mountain on the south bank of the Yellow River. According to some elderly people, in the decades before liberation, Cheng'gao County (now merged into Xingyang County) never had a single peaceful day. Warlords, bandits, and landlord militias fought year-round; especially after Japanese imperialism crossed the Yellow River, the disasters suffered by the people here deepened even further. According to them, in those years, people "lived their days on the edge of a knife." After liberation, people's lives underwent fundamental changes. They ended the days of "half a year of bran and vegetable rations." People who had never worn cotton pants even up to the age of eighty began to wear clean, fine cloth clothes. Here, beggars can no longer be seen, nor can idlers. Some feudal customs are gradually being replaced by new customs.
    
    Customs are Changing
    In the past, it was very difficult for an ordinary small household in Sima Village to marry a wife. There was a saying here: "Marrying a wife costs the price of an ox." Therefore, some farmers had to start saving several years in advance in order to marry a wife. But even after the wife entered the door, and even after she had a child, the debts were still not cleared. Like Hou Yongliang's five brothers, marrying four wives left them breathless for half their lives. Marrying off a daughter was the same. Even if the family had little to eat, they had to borrow money and provide a dowry. Now it's different. When Hou Fujiu married a wife and Hou Yuping married off a daughter, they didn't spend even 200,000 yuan. The bride and groom neither sat in a sedan chair nor bowed to heaven and earth. They only put on their favorite clothes, dressed neatly, wore two large red peony flowers, harnessed the agricultural production cooperative's mule, and sat on a large cart. The groom accompanied the bride from the woman's home to the man's home, joyfully talking and laughing along the way, without any restraint. Some brides even got married in the morning and ran out to work in the afternoon.
    
    In the past, small households were most afraid of funerals. The death of an elder was like the sky falling. Large families with many relatives were even more afraid. Distant relatives, close relatives, a carload of women, a pile of children, would come and immediately receive mourning cloth and demand food. Large amounts of cotton were woven into useless mourning cloth that wasn't durable for anything. Especially when a woman died, according to the old customs, the "woman's family" always had to make a scene at the man's house. But in recent years, these customs have also changed. The village peasant association has been able to handle these matters very appropriately. For example, when Hou Wentian's grandmother died, he was afraid that his uncle's family would come to make trouble, saying that the clothes and coffin were not good and would not allow the burial, so he went to the peasant association. The peasant association cadres said, "Bury her. If he makes trouble, we will reason with him." In fact, his uncle's family didn't come to nitpick. Currently, in the countryside around Luoyang, there is a new etiquette for funerals. Relatives who come are not given mourning cloth, but each wears a white paper flower. They don't burn paper horses or incense. The children come to pay their respects, talk about the person's deeds during their lifetime, and remember them. It is simple and the meaning is profound.
    
    In the past, during the Spring Festival, young people were most afraid of kowtowing. The village was large, and the seniority was late. They had to kowtow all day until dark, causing back pain and leg aches. Sometimes, in the snow, they had to kneel down and kowtow when they saw elders. Now they are learning to hold "group greetings" in the district. They neither worship gods nor gamble, but summarize production and then watch the plays performed by their own rural theater troupe.
    
    Breaking Superstition
    Sima Village used to have only an east gate and a west gate; but the land in the village was all south of the village, so sending manure, plowing, harrowing... all had to go around. Everyone felt that a south gate should be opened, but due to the landlord class spreading some superstitious legends, the gate was never opened. After the land reform, the landlords were overthrown. In 1953, the village established an agricultural production cooperative. After a proposal by the cooperative's director, Hou Tongyin, a wide and large south gate was opened on the south village wall, and a ten-mu threshing ground was opened outside the south gate. Now, standing in the village, you can see the fertile land at the foot of the South Mountain. People happily walk from this gate to the fields and carry the distributed grain in from this gate.
    
    In the past, building a house required consulting the almanac, and pasting a "Jiang Taigong is here, all gods retreat" sign on the wall when building a cattle trough. When Hou Linzhi's family built a house, his father was worried. But Hou Linzhi didn't believe in this. Later, Hou Linzhi's father saw that the agricultural production cooperative built so many houses and cattle troughs without consulting the almanac, and his courage grew, so he stopped believing in the almanac.
    
    Last year, this village borrowed liberation-style waterwheels. When digging wells, many old men said, "We dare not dig wells on the east side." Therefore, when digging the first well, many old men hid aside and dared not do it. The young men were not afraid of this, and they picked up hoes and started digging. Later, a large number of liberation-style waterwheels were borrowed, and almost all the land in the village was turned into paddy fields. Many wells were dug, and the elderly no longer felt there was anything wrong.
    
    In addition, there is such an interesting story:
    
    There are many people with the surname Hou in Sima Village. In the past, monkey trainers who entered this village would often be driven away. Therefore, some old monkey trainers knew this rule and detoured outside the village when passing through. This autumn, monkey trainers passed through here again. The children were eager to watch, and someone said, "Let them perform! Our Hou is not this monkey, there are no taboos!" Then they played in the crossroads of the village.
    
      Cultural Life
    Some time ago, I met an old man selling paper, pens, ink, and inkstones in the village primary school. When I talked to him, I learned that he had changed three occupations since liberation. He used to be a feng shui master who looked after graves. After liberation, the landlord class was overthrown, and farmers no longer looked at graves, so his business could not continue. However, he still recognized a few words, so he went to the post office entrance in the town to "write letters for others." He said, "Business was very good at first." Women and farmers in the countryside came to ask him. But in 1953, it didn't work anymore. People in the countryside, whether women or farmers, all carried a pen on their jacket lapels, and they walked past him without even looking at him. There was no way, so he changed to his current occupation - selling paper, pens, ink, and inkstones. He not only sells writing brushes but also sells pens. He said, "Pens are very popular in the countryside now!"
    
    Now, the enthusiasm for learning culture in the countryside is indeed very high. Young women in Sima Village have all attended people's schools. Many people who were illiterate in the past can now read newspapers and write letters. Tang Shulan and Hou Peilan had never attended school for a day, but now they recognize more than 2,000 characters. They write blackboard newspapers every day, and their handwriting is neat and tidy, just like teachers. This township subscribes to more than ten copies of "People's Daily" and "Henan Daily," and more than sixty copies of the farmers' own "Popular Newspaper." To ask how high the farmers' culture is now, I can give an example: When I first arrived in this village, I saw the cooperative director Hou Tongyin speaking to the cooperative members. He used to be an ordinary farmer and was illiterate; but now, whether he talks about agricultural technology, the use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizers, or the performance of various insecticide powders, he is like an agricultural expert. When speaking to the members about socialism, he is principled, specific, and like a veteran cadre who has been tempered for a long time.
    
    The current rural theater troupe is the most popular among the masses. The rural theater troupes of Yuanfang Township and Sima Village are both doing very well. They confiscated the gongs and drums of the shrines and started performing plays themselves. Sometimes they write some new plays themselves. Some are called three-person "crosstalk singing." Although the plot is simple, the content is very fresh, and the language is extremely popular. If they want to perform old plays, they can also choose the repertoire according to their own views.
    
    Sima Village is a village of more than one hundred households, but there are seven blackboard newspapers. These blackboard newspapers write out the important news from the newspapers every day, and also publish a large number of cultural and entertainment materials. The masses have their own editorial team, and the team leader is the old farmer Hou Liujin. Hou Liujin is a master of compiling quick-clappers, and his quick-clapper poems are welcomed by the masses of the whole village. The characteristic of these quick-clapper poems is that they can be closely combined with the current production and become a powerful weapon to promote production. For example, he satirized some selfish members and compiled a quick-clapper called "Let the Points Lead You" (meaning working solely for work points). The beginning is: "×× is not good enough, let the points lead you;..." For example, after the rain cleared, the cotton was not weeded in time, and he compiled "Cotton Complains." The beginning is: "Cotton opens its mouth and sheds tears, the members of the second team listen carefully: These days you didn't come to the ground to see, the weeds are growing too rampant..." Because the blackboard newspaper played a great role among the masses, the masses also compiled quick-clappers for the blackboard newspaper. The cooperative director Hou Tongyin compiled: "Blackboard newspaper, blackboard newspaper, like a mirror reflecting people..."
    
    Farmers like movies very much. Currently, they watch movies once or twice a month. They also have their own slides. If the movie projection team doesn't come for a month, they harness the carts to pick them up. Now the masses can understand the meaning of the movies and can see the good and the bad. An old lady said, "I used to only see people walking, hands moving, and trains running, but now I can see the meaning."
    
      New Women
    Zhang Chaojiang used to beat his wife often, with fists, whips, and hemp ropes. After the establishment of the democratic women's federation after liberation, he dared not beat her again. Now, because agricultural production cooperatives have been established, women can earn work points in labor, and their backs are getting straighter. Ordinary women who were beaten and bullied, now if you ask her, "Does your husband still bully you?" She will proudly say, "He dares! I don't eat his food, I don't wear his clothes, how dare he!"
    
    In the past, women were most afraid of the first and second months of the year. Once the Spring Festival arrived, the men would gamble day and night. If they lost money and drank alcohol, they would go back and beat women, and they might even sell the land. Therefore, every Spring Festival, women were always frightened. They hated the Spring Festival when the earth returned to spring, and they hated the spring when all flowers bloomed.
    
    After liberation, no one knows who released a rumor: "Whoever gambles again will be fined to eat donkey dung eggs." But no one had ever seen such a thing happen. Then the peasant association confiscated the gambling tools and burned them.
    
    Now, it is very common for women to participate in rural leadership work. The Xinlu Agricultural Production Cooperative has five female cooperative directors and female team leaders. Sometimes daughters-in-law have to assign work to their fathers-in-law, and wives have to lead their husbands in their work. At first, everyone was very unaccustomed to it, but now they are used to it. Fathers-in-law can directly call their daughters-in-law by their names to receive tasks. Some old men with long beards who were originally very prestigious in the clan, now if they have a quarrel with others, will naturally ask some young female cadres to resolve it.
    
    Regarding Labor as a Virtue
    Now, the standard for measuring a person in the countryside is mainly whether or not they labor. Taking Sima Village as an example, except for meal times, you rarely encounter idlers when entering the village. Collective labor has become people's habit. In the fields, whether hoeing, plowing, harvesting crops, or picking cotton, they are talking and laughing, regardless of age.
    
    There is a popular saying here called: "Afraid of poking fingers." Now, whoever wants to slack off can only do so at home, because as soon as they come out, someone will be poking their fingers behind them and gossiping about them.
    
    The feudal and backward countryside in people's impressions is now gone forever. Our countryside today has become a new "land of rites and music," and new and simple customs are changing the countryside.

    河南一农村
    李准
    这个村子叫司马村，在黄河南岸的郎山脚下。据一些年纪大的人谈，解放前，几十年间，这成皋县（现已并到荥阳县）就没有平稳过一天。军阀、土匪、地主团队整年打仗；特别是日本帝国主义过了黄河以后，这里人们的灾难就更加深重了。照他们的说法，在那些年代，人们是“在刀子刃上过日月”。解放以后，人们的生活有了根本的改变，他们结束了“糠菜半年粮”的日子，过去长到八十岁没有穿过棉裤的人，也开始穿上了干净的细布衣服。在这里，再看不到乞丐，再看不到游手好闲的人。一些封建的习俗，也逐渐为新的习俗所代替。
    风俗在转变
    过去，司马村一个普通的小户人家要娶个媳妇是很艰难的。这里有一句话是：“娶个媳妇一犋牛钱。”所以，有些农民为了娶媳妇必须在几年前就开始积蓄。可是直到媳妇进了门，甚至都抱了孩子，账还还不清。像侯永亮弟兄五个，娶了四个媳妇就弄得他们半辈子喘不过气来。嫁个闺女也是这样，眼看着家里没什么吃的了，也要借账、陪送嫁妆。现在可不同了，侯福聚娶媳妇时和侯玉平嫁闺女时，他们都没有花到二十万块钱。新郎新娘一不坐花轿，二不拜天地，他们只穿上自己最喜欢的衣服，收拾得干干净净，戴上两朵大红牡丹花，套上农业生产合作社的骡子，坐上大车，新郎陪着新娘由女家到男家，一路上欢天喜地，说说笑笑，毫不拘束。甚至，有的新娘上午结了婚，下午就跑着出去劳动了。
    在过去，小户人家最怕办丧事，死了老人像塌了天。族大、亲戚多更是怕人，远亲戚，近亲戚，来一车妇女，带一堆小孩，一来就得领孝布，就得吃饭。大量的棉花被织成没有用处的孝布，做什么也不耐穿。特别是死了妇女，照老规矩，“娘家人”总要到男家闹一通。但这几年，这些风俗也改变了。村里农民协会已能很恰当地来处理这些事情。如侯文田的奶奶死了，害怕他舅爷家来闹着说衣服不行啦，棺材不行啦，不叫埋葬，他就去找农民协会。农民协会的干部说：“你埋吧。他闹由我们和他说道理。”其实他舅爷家也没来挑剔。目前，在洛阳一带乡下办丧事已有了新的礼仪，来的亲戚，一律不用孝布，每人戴上一朵白纸花，不烧纸马不烧香，儿女们来凭吊一番，说说这人的生前劳动事迹，追念追念，既朴实、意思也深刻。
    以前过春节的时候，年轻人最怕的是叩头。村子大，辈数晚，一天叩头叩到天黑，叩得腰痛腿酸。有时候在大雪地里，见了长辈人也得跪下叩头。现在他们学习区上举行“团拜”。既不敬神也不赌钱，总结总结生产，接着就看自己农村剧团唱的戏。
    破除迷信
    司马村过去只有东门和西门；但村子里的地都在村南，所以送粪、犁地、耙地……都得绕着走。大家都觉得应该开个南寨门，可是由于地主阶级散布了一些迷信传说，寨门一直没有开。土地改革后，地主被打倒了，到一九五三年，村里成立了农业生产合作社，经过社长侯同寅的提议，这才在南寨墙上开了一个又宽又大的南门，又在南寨门外开了个十亩大的打麦场。现在站在村子里就能望见南山下那一片肥美的土地。人们愉快地从这个门走向田野，又从这个门扛进来分到的粮食。
    过去盖房子都要看历书，垒个牛槽也要在墙上贴一张“姜太公在此，诸神退位”。侯林智家盖房子，他爹放心不下。侯林智却不信这一套。后来侯林智爹看见农业生产合作社盖那多房子、垒那多的牛槽也不看历书，自己的胆子才大起来，就不再相信历书了。
    去年这个村贷来解放式水车。在打井的时候，有不少老头说“东边地上不敢打井”。因此在打第一眼井时，许多老头子都躲在一旁不敢动手。小伙子们不怕这一套，拿起镢头就刨。后来解放式水车大量地贷来了，村里差不多的地都变成了水田，打了许多井，老年人也再不觉得有什么不妥了。
    另外，还有这么一段有趣的故事：
    司马村姓侯的多。过去玩猴的如果进这村，往往会讨个没趣被赶走。因此一些老玩猴的都知道这个规矩，经过这村时就绕到村外走。今年秋天玩猴的又由这里过，小孩子们一心要看，不知道谁说了一句：“玩吧！咱们的侯不是这个猴，没有忌讳了！”接着就在村里十字街上玩了起来。
      文化生活
    前些时，我在村里小学校里碰到一个卖纸笔墨砚的老先生。我和他谈起来，知道他解放后换过三种职业。他原来是个看坟地的风水先生。解放后，地主阶级被打倒了，农民不再看坟地，他的生意也就吃不开了。不过他还识几个字，就到镇上的邮局门口给人家“代写书信”。他说，“起初生意很好”，乡里的妇女和农民都来求他。可是到一九五三年不行了。乡里人，不论妇女还是农民，人家袄襟上都带上了一支钢笔，由他跟前走过连理也不理他，没办法，他又换了现在的职业——卖纸笔墨砚。他不但卖毛笔，还卖钢笔。他说：“钢笔现在在乡里可时兴了！”
    现在农村里学文化的热情确实是很高的。司马村的年轻妇女都上了民校。许多过去不识字的人，现在也能读报写信了。唐淑兰和侯培兰原来没上过一天学，目前已识到两千多字。她们每天写黑板报，字写得整整齐齐，就像当过教员似的。这个乡订有十多份“人民日报”和“河南日报”，有六十多份农民自己的“大众报”。要问现在农民的文化有多高，我可以举个例子：我初到这个村时，见到社长侯同寅给社员们讲话。他过去是个普通农民，并不识字；但现在，他无论谈农业技术，讲肥料的氮、磷、钾的使用，或讲各种治虫药粉的性能，都像个农业专家。对社员讲社会主义时，有原则，又具体，又像个久经锻炼的老干部。
    现在的农村剧团，是最受群众欢迎的。袁坊乡和司马村的农村剧团都搞得很好。他们没收了神社的锣鼓乐器，自己就演起戏来。有时候他们自己编些新戏，有的叫作三人“对口唱”，情节虽然简单，内容却很新鲜，语言也极通俗。要演旧戏，他们也能根据自己的看法去选择剧目。
    司马村是个一百多户人家的村庄，可是黑板报就有七块。这些黑板报每天都把报纸上的重要消息写出来，另外还登出大批的文化娱乐材料。群众有自己的编辑组，组长是老农民侯六斤。侯六斤是个编快板的能手，他的快板诗为全村群众所欢迎。这些快板诗的特点是能够同当前的生产紧密结合起来，成为推动生产的有力武器。例如他讽刺一部分自私的社员，编了“让分牵着跑”（专为了工分而干活的意思）的快板。一开头就是：“××不够好，让分牵着跑；……”又如在雨过天晴后，棉花没有及时锄，他编了“棉花诉苦”。开头是：“棉花开言泪汪汪，二队社员听端详：这几天你没到地来看，野草长的太猖狂。……”因为黑板报在群众中起了很大的作用，群众也给黑板报编快板。社长侯同寅编的是：“黑板报，黑板报，好似镜子把人照。……”
    农民对电影十分喜欢。目前，他们每月总要看一两次电影。他们自己还有幻灯。电影放映队如果一个月不来，他们就套起大车去接。现在群众已经能够看出电影里面的意思，并且能看出好坏了。一个老太太说：“我以前只会看人走，手动弹，火车跑，现在能看意思了。”
      新妇女
    张潮江过去常打老婆，用拳头打，用鞭子打，用麻绳打。解放后成立了民主妇女联合会，他不敢再打了。现在因为成立了农业生产合作社，女人们能够在劳动中挣工分，腰杆越发硬了。平常挨打受气的女人，现在你要问她：“你丈夫是不是还欺负你？”她总会骄傲地说：“他敢！没吃他的，没穿他的，他敢咋着！”
    在过去妇女们最怕的是正二月。一到春节，男人们就没明没夜地赌博。他们输了钱，喝了酒，回去就打女人，还保不准要把田地卖出去。所以，每到春节，妇女们总是心惊肉颤的。她们最恨大地回春的春节，最恨万花争妍的春天。
    解放后，不知道谁放出了一股风：“谁再赌博要罚吃驴粪蛋。”可是谁也没见过这样的事情。接着农民协会就把赌具收去烧毁了。
    现在妇女们参加乡村领导工作是极平常的事。新路农业生产合作社就有妇女社长和妇女队长五人。有时候儿媳妇要给老公公分配活，妻子要领导丈夫工作。最初大家很不习惯，现在习惯了，老公公可以直接叫着儿媳妇的名字来领任务。有些原来在族下很有威望的胡子大长的老头，现在如果和别人闹了气，也很自然地去要求一些年纪轻轻的妇女干部来解决了。
    把劳动看成人的美德
    现在在农村衡量一个人的标准，主要是劳动不劳动。就以司马村来看，除了吃饭时候，进到村里很少碰见闲人。集体劳动已经成了人们的习惯，他们（或她们）在田野里，不管锄地、犁地、割庄稼、摘棉花，都是不分老少地说着笑着。
    这里流行一句话叫：“害怕捣指头。”现在谁想偷偷懒，也只能在家里，因为一出来就有人在背后用指头捣着他、议论着他。
    在人们印象中封建落后的农村，现在是一去不复返了。我们今天的农村已变成新的“礼乐之邦”，新的淳朴的风俗正在改变着农村。
