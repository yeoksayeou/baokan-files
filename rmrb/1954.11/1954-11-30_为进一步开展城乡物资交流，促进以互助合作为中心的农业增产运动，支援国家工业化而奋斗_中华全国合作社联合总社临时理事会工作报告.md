Report on the Work of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives
    中華全The All-China Federation of Cooperatives Provisional Council Acting Director Cheng Zihua
    Fellow representatives, esteemed guests:

    It has been exactly four years since the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference established the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in July 1950. I now present to the conference, on behalf of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, a report on the main activities of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives nationwide over the past four years, as well as the guiding principles and tasks that should be adopted in the future, for your examination.

    I. Main Achievements of Supply and Marketing and Consumer Cooperatives in the Past Four Years

    Four years ago, when the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference was convened, China was in the early stage of economic recovery, land reform had just begun in the vast newly liberated areas, and the restoration of the national economy, ravaged by prolonged war and reactionary rule, was also just starting. Adjusting industry and commerce, balancing the national budget, stabilizing prices, and enlivening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, "struggling to fundamentally improve the nation's financial and economic situation" was the serious task then put forward to the Chinese people by the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. At that time, the nation had approximately 20 million cooperative members, mainly distributed in the old liberated areas of Northeast, North, and East China where land reform had been completed. These cooperatives generally played a certain role in the people's economic life, but many cooperatives had not yet embarked on the right track in terms of organizational development and business operations, and lacked necessary systems and methods. This situation was clearly not adapted to the requirements of national economic recovery and development at the time, nor to the needs of the broad masses of the working people.

    The National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference in July 1950, under the direct leadership and assistance of the CCP Central Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, summarized the work of the cooperatives at that time. Based on Chairman Mao's instruction: "The nature of cooperatives is to serve the masses, that is, to think of the masses in everything, to plan for the masses, and to put the interests of the masses first," it clearly pointed out that cooperatives are the economic organizations of the working masses themselves, and that to run cooperatives well, it is necessary to emphasize democratic systems and implement the principle of higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving their members. At the same time, it was pointed out that cooperatives are economic undertakings under the management of the state power led by the working class, and they must conscientiously implement state policies and become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce in organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and in the struggle against speculation by private merchants. Based on these principles, it was stipulated that to run cooperatives well, it is necessary to work according to socialist methods, not capitalist methods. Based on these principles, cooperative societies at all levels should become a mass economic organization with an independent organizational system, independently managing their own affairs and assuming responsibility for their own profits and losses, while also implementing the principle of democratic centralism, with lower-level societies subject to the leadership of higher-level societies. In business operations, they should not only execute certain economic tasks according to the state plan, but also strive to improve business management and gradually implement an economic accounting system. The representative conference at that time emphasized that cooperatives in various regions should be reorganized and developed in accordance with the above principles and methods, and the conference elected a provisional central leadership body for cooperatives nationwide—the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives—to implement unified leadership over cooperatives nationwide.

    From that conference until now, over the past four years, with the recovery and development of the entire national economy, the work of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the state-owned economy, and with the active efforts of all employees at all levels of the cooperative system and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of cooperative members, has achieved great success.

    As of the first quarter of this year, there were 32,265 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, 132,349 retail stores, and 35,056 mobile retail organizations nationwide. There were a total of 164,385,737 members, an increase of more than eightfold compared to 1950. By the end of 1953, the owned capital of cooperative societies at all levels had increased by 19.5 times compared to 1950, and members' share capital had also increased by 10.7 times.

    In 1953, the total volume of commodity supply and sales of cooperatives nationwide increased by 9.9 times compared to 1950. In the first half of 1954, the retail plan was overfulfilled by 10.1 percent, and the procurement plan was overfulfilled by 10.4 percent, both more than double that of the same period in 1953.

    In 1953, the retail sales of cooperatives accounted for 25.73 percent of the total retail sales in the market, accounting for 18.16 percent in cities and 29.69 percent in rural areas. In areas where work developed earlier, cooperatives accounted for 50 to 80 percent of the total retail sales in the rural market, basically occupying the rural market.

    In 1953, in the supply business of cooperatives in rural areas, means of production accounted for 15.9 percent, and means of livelihood accounted for 84.1 percent. Among the means of production supplied to rural areas, commodity fertilizers were mainly supplied in the past. In the past one or two years, the proportion of new and old farm tools, pesticides, and pesticide application equipment has gradually increased, and the operation of livestock and feed has begun.

    In 1953, in the procurement business of cooperatives, procurement on behalf of the state accounted for 75.4 percent. Commodities that the state needs to control, such as grain, cotton, hemp, tobacco, tea, silk, and wool, major industrial raw materials, and export goods, have been completely or mostly purchased through cooperatives. Since the implementation of the planned purchase and supply of grain and oil in late 1953, cooperatives have become the main reliance for the state to carry out this heavy task.

    Over the past four years, due to the tremendous development of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in organization and business, a new type of trade network has been formed that covers all parts of the country, and it has increasingly become an important component of the economic life of the Chinese people. It has played a significant role in the restoration and development of the national economy in recent years, particularly in the restoration and development of agriculture. It has not only become a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices and carrying out the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and not only become an indispensable economic organization for the working people in supplying means of production and livelihood and reducing the exploitation of private merchants, but also consolidated and expanded the leading forces of the socialist economy, narrowed the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas, and promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, thereby helping to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, through the development of work over the past few years, experience has been accumulated, hundreds of thousands of cadres have been trained, and socialist capital accumulation has been increased, laying the foundation for further sound development in the future. All these facts show that the development of our work over the past four years is in line with the spirit of the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and in line with the principles put forward by the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference in 1950.

    But at the same time, it should be pointed out that our work has had many shortcomings and errors in the past four years. The main ones are:

    First, the principle that supply and marketing cooperatives must serve agricultural production was not clear enough, the understanding was not completely consistent, and the implementation was not resolute and forceful enough. In terms of the supply of means of production, the main forces in the past few years have been concentrated on the supply of oil cake and chemical fertilizers, and insufficient attention has been paid to the operation of old-style farm tools and native fertilizers. The operation of new-style farm tools, pesticides, and pesticide application equipment has been overly emphasized as difficult, and the operation has not been active enough. The importance of the system of advance purchase contracts and combined contracts for agricultural products has not been adequately recognized, and systematic summaries and promotions have not been paid attention to. The promotion of the contract system in 1953 once fell into a state of laissez-faire.

    Second, there are varying degrees of capitalist business thinking. They are willing to operate large urban industrial products and large-volume local specialties that have relatively high profits or are relatively easy to operate, but are unwilling to actively operate handicrafts and small local products that have relatively small profits or are difficult to operate, but are needed for the production and life of the vast rural areas. There is a phenomenon of mutual competition for profits, concealment or false reporting of costs, and failure to strictly abide by contract credit between higher-level cooperatives and lower-level cooperatives, and between cooperatives in producing areas and selling areas. At the same time, due to insufficient investigation and research on the needs of the masses and market conditions, there is a great deal of blindness in business operations. There is also serious supply system thinking in management, and no attention is paid to accounting and reasonable accumulation, financial supervision and management is not strict, labor efficiency is low, the proportion of non-production expenses is high, and the safekeeping of property lacks a responsibility system, which affects the reasonable accumulation of cooperatives, and even some cooperatives have losses.

    Third, there is insufficient respect for the leadership of state-owned commerce, and there are antagonistic emotions and a certain degree of decentralism in some work. The most prominent manifestation is that from 1952 to 1953, an industrial product wholesale system that was completely parallel to state-owned commerce regardless of commodity type was once established, which not only affected the unified control of state-owned commerce over the wholesale market, but also hindered the implementation of the policy of cooperatives facing local sources of goods.

    Fourth, democratic management in many areas is very poor; no attention is paid to holding membership meetings or representative meetings, and the council and supervisory committee have not played their due roles; many cadres lack democratic style and a correct service attitude.

    Fifth, political work is neglected, and insufficient attention is paid to improving the political and ideological level of cadres, especially business cadres, and patriotic and collectivist propaganda and education to cooperative members through business is also poorly done.

    All these shortcomings and errors are inseparable from the subjectivism and bureaucratism in the leadership of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. Thanks to the timely and correct instructions and assistance given to us by the CCP Central Committee, these shortcomings and errors have been continuously corrected in recent years; but not all of these shortcomings and errors have been completely corrected in all places and among all cadres. On the contrary, these shortcomings and errors still exist to varying degrees in many places and among many cadres, and we still need to continue to work hard to overcome them.

    II. Basic Tasks of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives During the Transition Period

    Chairman Mao clearly instructed: "From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation is a transition period. The general line and general task of the Party during this transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a considerable period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. This general line is the lighthouse that illuminates all our work. If any work deviates from it, it will make right-leaning or 'left-leaning' errors."

    In order to realize the above-mentioned general task of the country during the transition period, as instructed by Chairman Mao, and in order to build our country into a socialist country, the basic link is to realize the socialist industrialization of the country, and it is necessary to first concentrate the main forces to develop heavy industry. We must recognize the extremely important significance of the country's socialist industrialization centered on the development of heavy industry, and recognize that it is the highest interest of the people of the whole country.

    In order to realize the socialist industrialization of the country, the agricultural economy must have a corresponding development. However, at present, China's agricultural economy is still dominated by a scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy, which not only restricts the improvement of agricultural productivity, but also fosters capitalist spontaneous forces, which contradicts the requirements of the country's planned construction. To overcome the contradiction between the small-scale peasant economy and socialist industrialization, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture through the path of cooperation.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives are one of the three forms of rural cooperation (agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation is the main form), and are mass-based commercial organizations of a socialist nature. They are a bridge for the Party and the government to connect with the broad masses of farmers and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The development in the past few years has shown its important role in the rural economy and the entire national economy. In order to carry out our work better and fully play our due role under the guidance of this lighthouse of the general line, supply and marketing cooperatives should clarify and implement the following three basic tasks during the transition period:

    First, through supply and marketing operations, carry out the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, serve agricultural production, support national industrialization, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance;

    Second, according to national plans and price policies, guide the small-scale peasant economy and individual handicrafts to gradually incorporate into the track of national plans, and promote their socialist transformation through planned supply and marketing operations and the contract system;

    Third, under the leadership of state-owned commercial leading organs, expand organized commodity circulation, lead the rural market, gradually realize the transformation of rural private merchants, replace the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas, and gradually cut off the connection between farmers and urban capitalism.

    The above three basic tasks are closely related and interact with each other. The central link to implement these three basic tasks is to promote the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and serve agricultural production. Only by firmly grasping this central link can we effectively promote the development of rural productivity, on the one hand, help farmers produce more commodity grain, industrial raw materials, export goods, and agricultural and sideline products needed by cities, industrial and mining areas for the state, and on the other hand, increase the purchasing power of farmers and expand the market for industrial products, thereby supporting the country's industrial construction. Only by firmly grasping this central link can supply and marketing cooperatives expand organized and planned exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, victoriously gradually replace the position of capitalist commerce in rural areas, link the scattered small-scale peasant economy and individual handicrafts with national plans, and promote their socialist transformation. All of this is to realize the socialist industrialization of the country and build our country into a socialist country.

    Therefore, cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must have a good grasp of the spirit and essence of these three basic tasks in all their work, establish an overall thinking of socialist construction with national industrialization as the main body, and be good at combining the partial interests, immediate interests of cooperative members, and the highest interests of national industrialization through all business activities and organizational activities. At the same time, we must also proceed from the actual situation in rural areas, and adhere to the principle of being both active and steady in the steps and methods of work, and avoid blind advancement.

    III. Several Major Tasks That Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Must Do Well Under the New Situation of Urban and Rural Markets

    Since China began its planned economic construction in 1953, many new situations have emerged in urban and rural markets, the main point being that many commodities are in short supply, especially consumer goods and agricultural means of production. This is because the state has invested a large amount of funds in economic construction, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas has increased, and the total amount of social wages and farmers' income have increased significantly, which has further increased the purchasing power of urban and rural people on the basis of the increase in recent years. The rate of growth of social purchasing power exceeding the rate of growth of consumer goods and agricultural means of production will be a trend that exists for a considerable period of time. This is the result of the restoration and development of the national economy after the victory of the revolution and the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of working people, and it is also a driving force for the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    The rapid development of socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in recent years, the deep implementation of the propaganda of the general task of the transition period, the implementation of the policy of planned purchase and planned supply, and the high tide of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, all these factors have also caused profound changes in urban and rural markets and rural economy.

    In the situation where many commodities are in short supply and fundamental changes have taken place in urban and rural markets, further expanding the organized and planned circulation of social commodities and continuing to maintain market stability are necessary prerequisites for ensuring the country's economic construction. Therefore, in order to realize its basic tasks during the transition period, supply and marketing cooperatives must adapt to these new situations and requirements that have emerged in the domestic market and rural economy, and focus on doing the following major tasks in business operations:

    First, do a good job of planned purchase and planned supply entrusted by the state, vigorously develop local sources of goods, and further expand the circulation of goods between urban and rural areas.

    According to the preliminary experience implemented in various regions, when performing this important national task, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must first assist the state to accurately determine the production volume and commodity volume of planned purchase materials. According to the state's regulations, they must facilitate farmers as much as possible in all aspects such as inspection, grading, weighing, and payment, and do a good job of warehousing, storage, and transportation. They must do a good job of supplying materials and timely supply farmers with the means of production and livelihood they need, and assist the state in withdrawing currency. Secondly, when undertaking planned supply work, the supply and marketing cooperatives must carefully investigate and meticulously plan the establishment of supply points and the provisions of supply standards and supply methods under the leadership of the local Party committee, government, and state-owned commercial leadership. This is to facilitate mass purchase and prevent the supply surface from being too wide and the supply volume from being too large, so that speculative behavior has no chance to take advantage of. They should also do a good job in the rational allocation and necessary reserve of planned supply materials, prevent artificial shortages and backlogs, and oppose favoritism and dereliction of duty and the bureaucratic style of being irresponsible to the masses. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives must accept the entrustment of the state and do a good job in the grain market under state management without the participation of private merchants, and actively organize the mutual regulation of grain and oil by farmers to solve the supply of raw materials to the food industry and grain and oil processing industry in villages and towns.

    Planned purchase and planned supply can only be limited to a few major commodities. In order to meet the growing production and livelihood needs of the vast rural areas, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must also strengthen general supply and procurement operations, vigorously organize commodity circulation, and revitalize the primary market to further promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In terms of supply operations, in addition to actively assisting state-owned commerce in organizing industrial products to go to the countryside, they should also attach importance to developing local sources of goods and expanding the supply of handicraft products to supplement the shortcomings of modern industrial products. While strengthening the operation of means of production, they must also pay attention to expanding the supply of means of livelihood. Relaxing any aspect is incorrect.

    In terms of procurement operations, in addition to ensuring the completion of the state's procurement plan, they should also actively purchase local and sideline products that farmers need to sell. There are many types of small local products in rural areas, scattered in thousands of households. When concentrated, they can become a considerable quantity, which is an important task for increasing the source of goods, supplying the needs of urban, industrial, and mining areas or exports, and increasing the income of farmers. In the past, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have not done enough in the purchase of small local products, and must be strengthened in the future.

    Second, strengthen the supply of agricultural means of production, carry out the system of advance purchase contracts and combined contracts, and promote agricultural production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

    To do a good job in the supply of means of production such as farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and feed, it is necessary to grasp the changing laws of rural needs based on different situations such as production seasons, economic crop areas, general crop areas, mountainous areas, plains, water fields, dry lands, and the degree of development of mutual aid and cooperation. It is necessary to overcome conservative views and prevent the bias of blind operation. In the organization of sources of goods, we should adopt the policy of mainly taking local materials, local processing, and local supply, supplemented by regional regulation, and rely on the masses in many ways to explore local potential forces.

    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the needs of the vast rural areas for new-style farm tools, large farm tools, large livestock, and pesticides and pesticide application equipment will inevitably increase year by year. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must fully recognize the important significance of operating these means of production for consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation and improving agricultural productivity, closely cooperate with agricultural departments, and actively operate these businesses. There are certain difficulties in operating new-style farm tools and pesticides and pesticide application equipment in the promotion stage, but they must be overcome and can be overcome.

    Regarding the operation of livestock, according to past experience, we should mainly strengthen the leadership and transformation of the local livestock market, and plan to organize farmers to regulate each other. If it is necessary to purchase from remote areas, we should contact the producing areas in advance under the unified organization of higher-level cooperatives and carry out purchases in a planned manner.

    The supply of commodity fertilizers falling short of demand will be a long-term trend. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should cooperate with local Party committees and governments to actively mobilize farmers to accumulate natural fertilizers and vigorously operate native fertilizers. Oil cake and chemical fertilizers should be mainly supplied to industrial raw material crop areas and grain producing areas that already have usage habits, and should not be blindly promoted.

    Implementing the system of advance purchase contracts and combined contracts is an important method of promoting the organization of individual farmers and gradually incorporating agricultural production into the track of national plans. Supply and marketing cooperatives should take agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as the main targets for advance purchase of agricultural products, but appropriate measures can also be taken for individual farmers to implement advance purchase. The deposit for advance purchase should mainly be used to help poor farmers solve production and life difficulties, and average distribution is incorrect. However, when purchasing, we must do a good job of recovering the deposit; failure to pay attention to recovering the deposit will cause losses to state funds, and treating the advance purchase deposit as relief funds is also wrong. Credit advance purchase should be implemented for rich peasants without paying a deposit.

    When supply and marketing cooperatives order agricultural and sideline products from farmers through combined contracts, the types of goods supplied by the contract should generally be mainly agricultural tools and fertilizers, and it must be ensured that the source of goods is guaranteed and that the supply is timely according to the contract. Including too many varieties and attempting to completely fix the commodities that farmers need to buy or sell through contracts has proven to be a failure.

    Whether it is an advance purchase contract or a combined contract, the procedures should be simple and easy to implement, and the contract credit should be carefully fulfilled. In addition to strengthening publicity and education on abiding by contract credit to farmers who have signed contracts, we should also pay attention to helping them overcome difficulties in production and life through daily supply and marketing operations to ensure the smooth realization of the contract.

    Third, actively establish planned supply and sales relationships with handicrafts, increase the source of handicraft products, and promote the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives should support handicraft production in a planned way according to the needs of the state and the people, develop the production of agricultural means of production and urban and rural people's daily necessities, and develop handicraft manufacturing that can be exported.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives should mainly take the method of processing orders for scattered individual handicrafts, planned to supply them with the raw materials they need and purchase their products, help them overcome difficulties in the off-season, and guide them to improve product specifications and quality, and expand product sales. In this way, not only can the supply and marketing cooperatives' source of goods be guaranteed, but also individual handicraftsmen can feel the benefits of combining with the supply and marketing cooperatives, gradually get rid of the exploitation of capitalist commerce and usury, and embark on the road of cooperation.

    For the handicraft production cooperative organizations that have been organized, supply and marketing cooperatives should closely integrate with them and implement contract management under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit to promote their consolidation and development. In the pricing issue, we should adhere to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, disclose costs, and negotiate and set a reasonable distribution ratio of price difference under the principle that production profits should be greater than commercial profits.

    Fourth, strengthen the management of processing enterprises and give full play to their potential production capacity.

    By the end of 1953, there were a total of 11,766 processing enterprises affiliated to cooperatives at all levels nationwide, with 218,000 employees. The total output value in 1953 increased by 5.5 times compared with 1950; of which 1,956 were relatively large-scale, with 138,000 employees and 48,000 horsepower. This is an important force that cannot be ignored both for increasing the total social production and for the development of the business of supply and marketing cooperatives. In the past, we have not paid enough attention to this work, and many processing enterprises have many problems in both production management and enterprise operation.

    In order to further adapt to the needs of agricultural product processing and expand the source of goods supplied to supplement the shortcomings of national industrial production, the council of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must strengthen the leadership and management of subordinate processing enterprises in the future, effectively grasp their production plans under the unified plan of the local financial committee and supervise their implementation; processing enterprises that meet the conditions should implement independent accounting to strengthen enterprise management and give full play to potential production capacity. However, when local areas need to expand or build new processing enterprises, they must carefully formulate plans and submit them to the local financial committee and higher-level cooperatives for review and approval to prevent blind development.

    Fifth, under the unified leadership of the state-owned commercial leading organ, actively lead the primary market and transform private merchants.

    The tremendous changes that have taken place in the rural market after the propaganda of the general task of the transition period and the implementation of the planned purchase and planned supply of grain and oil mainly manifest in the shrinking free market, the proportion of cooperative turnover in the total market turnover rising rapidly, the proportion of private merchants declining sharply, and the necessity of using new socialist exchange channels instead of the old capitalist exchange channels is even more obvious because state-owned commercial organizations' urban-rural exchanges and the vast number of farmers' buying and selling are more dependent on cooperatives. Under this circumstance, it is necessary to make appropriate arrangements for the future of private merchants and correctly and resolutely implement the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming them. Therefore, according to the recent decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, in the future, supply and marketing cooperatives must actively assume the important responsibility of leading the primary market and transforming private merchants under the unified leadership of the state-owned commercial leading organ. When supply and marketing cooperatives consider the development of their own work, they must also consider the overall arrangement of the primary market, and make full use of the favorable conditions of market relationship changes and reorganization, and take the method of advancing on one side, arranging on one side, and advancing one line and arranging one line to carry out socialist transformation of rural private merchants actively and steadily. In addition to a portion that must and can be transferred, private commerce should generally be gradually transformed into various forms of state capitalist commerce; as for some of their members, after transformation, they can also be absorbed as employees of cooperatives.

    Leading the primary market and transforming private merchants is a very arduous task. Cooperative societies at all levels, especially provincial cooperative societies, must strengthen specific guidance to county cooperative societies and grassroots cooperative societies, and strengthen ideological education and policy education for cadres. Matters such as the price policy of the rural market, the arrangement of the proportion of public and private ownership, and the specific policies and methods that should be adopted for various types of private merchants must be subject to the unified leadership of the local Party committee, government, and state-owned commercial leading organ.

    Under the conditions that the business of supply and marketing cooperatives is expanding day by day, the retail network and procurement network are deeply penetrating into various townships and villages, and are gradually replacing private merchants, the role of the original market towns in rural areas has indeed undergone significant changes. However, state-managed grain markets, large cooperative stores, specialized stores, processing enterprises, and the exchange between farmers, handicraft production, etc., are still centered on market towns. Therefore, in the process of leading the primary market and transforming private merchants, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should also pay attention to the construction of rural market towns, and under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, plan to transform market towns from economic strongholds that connect capitalism with rural areas into economic strongholds that connect socialism with rural areas according to the needs of local rural economic development, making them a new hub for urban-rural exchanges, and playing its due role in further organizing rural economic life.

    Sixth, conscientiously implement the state's price policy and assist state-owned commerce in doing a good job in price work.

    In order to assist state-owned commerce in guiding production and consumption in a planned way, stabilizing the market, and transforming private merchants in a situation where many commodities are in short supply, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must conscientiously implement the state's price policy and keep pace with state-owned commerce in price work.

    Regarding the purchase price of agricultural and sideline products, all those that have been specified by state-owned commerce must be strictly observed and purchased at the listed price, and attention should be paid to investigating and studying the production costs of these products, the reaction of farmers to the listed price, and the activities of private merchants; if it is found that the specified listed price is inappropriate, opinions should be actively submitted to state-owned commerce, but the listed price cannot be changed casually. For small local products, handicraft products, and means of production that are not operated or specified by state-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should also carefully study their reasonable parity ratio, carefully propose a purchase price plan, and implement it after reporting it to the local financial committee for approval.

    For the retail price of cooperatives in rural areas, the national price must be strictly implemented for commodities supplied by plan and commodities sold on behalf of state-owned commerce; for other commodities, if there is a state-owned store in the local area, it should be consistent with the national price (except for individual areas where preferential prices for cooperative members cannot be canceled temporarily); if there is no state-owned store in the local area, the retail price can be carefully specified with reference to the prices of state-owned stores in nearby areas and the policy for private merchants, and implemented after reporting it to the local financial committee for approval.

    The method of giving price preferences to cooperative members played a certain role in the early stage of the development of supply and marketing cooperatives and during periods of unstable prices. However, in order to reduce management difficulties, not affect the reasonable accumulation of cooperatives, and facilitate the leadership of the rural market and the arrangement of private merchants, this method should no longer be continued. In areas where the development of cooperative organizations has reached or approached saturation, and the difference between cooperative members and non-members has basically disappeared, this preferential system should be canceled immediately. Even in individual areas where it is still difficult to cancel this preferential system immediately because it is still necessary to develop organizations, we should do a good job of publicity and explanation to cooperative members, reduce preferential varieties, narrow the price difference for non-members, and strive to gradually cancel it in the short term. In order to closely connect cooperative members with the cooperative, distinguish between cooperative members and non-members, we should take measures such as implementing low-price quantitative supply for a few specific commodities or giving priority to cooperative members, as well as appropriate dividends and certain welfare facilities.

    IV. Improve Business Management and Gradually Promote the Economic Accounting System

    Supply and marketing cooperatives are economic undertakings and enterprise organizations, and all the tasks they undertake must be specifically realized through supply and marketing business activities. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp the important link of improving business management and gradually promoting the economic accounting system. At present, the phenomena of great blindness, poor planning and organization, unreasonable labor organization, poor business technology, chaotic assets, high proportion of non-production expenses, and no attention to reasonable accumulation and business losses are serious in the business operations of cooperative societies at all levels. If this is not vigorously reversed, the entire work of supply and marketing cooperatives will be difficult to consolidate and improve in the future.

    First, strengthen investigation and research, strengthen the statistical system, systematically and deeply understand the needs of the masses, market conditions, and the progress of cooperative work, establish the necessary statistical system, and correctly formulate plans on this basis, and conscientiously handle affairs according to the plan, to gradually strengthen planned management and overcome the blindness of business operations.

    Second, improve enterprise management organizations, gradually implement a responsibility system with specialized responsibilities, and change the current situation of excessive administrative personnel, low labor efficiency, and no one being responsible. To achieve this, the current important link in supply business is to implement the "allocation of goods with pricing and physical responsibility system." We should also pay attention to improving trade organization and technology, and establish feasible systems from store setting, commodity sales, procurement, allocation, storage to warehouse management, and constantly study and improve methods to improve business technology.

    In the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, we should strive to improve inspection technology, correctly implement the policy of grading and pricing and preferential pricing for superior grades, and do a good job in inspection, warehousing, and storage in accordance with the principle of facilitating farmers.

    Third, strengthen financial management and accounting. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of business plans, we should strive to accelerate turnover, continuously reduce circulation costs, and increase reasonable accumulation.

    Planned management and economic accounting system are the management system of socialist enterprises. According to the current uneven development of work in various regions, areas with backlog of accounts and chaotic finances should first do a good job of cleaning up and rectification to create conditions for gradually implementing the economic accounting system; areas with existing conditions should first conduct pilot projects and steadily promote it. However, it must be noted that in implementing this management system of socialist enterprises, we must establish a comprehensive accounting perspective and oppose the localist ideology and the purely profit-oriented perspective that undermine policies.

    V. Appropriately Adjust the Organizational Form of Grassroots Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Strengthen the Democratic Management System

    In 1951, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives proposed that the organizational form of rural grassroots cooperatives should be based on the principle of economic zoning and taking into account administrative zoning. Generally, cooperatives should be established with market towns as the center, and in areas with few market towns, large villages can be taken as the center. Some areas have also implemented cooperative establishment based on townships or districts. This organizational form mainly based on economic zoning is in line with the requirements of developing the cooperative business network, organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, stabilizing prices, and fighting against speculative private merchants during the economic recovery period. Now the country has entered a period of planned socialist construction and systematic socialist transformation. In order to facilitate the close integration of production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and planned purchase and planned supply under the unified leadership of the Party committee to realize the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, the organizational form of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should adopt the principle of mainly based on administrative zoning and taking into account economic zoning to facilitate the unified leadership of the Party committee.

    The advantage of establishing cooperative societies with a township or several townships as a unit is that it is convenient for mass democratic supervision and for close integration with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations. However, in order to lead the primary market and transform private merchants, and in order to solve the difficulties of small funds, small business scale, and difficulty in meeting the needs of the masses in establishing cooperative societies with townships as units, areas that have established cooperative societies with townships as units should plan to establish a central cooperative society in large market towns under the leadership of the town Party committee or district Party committee. County cooperative societies can also set up supply and marketing stations in large market towns as needed to strengthen the supply and sales wholesale business of township cooperative societies.

    The advantage of establishing a cooperative society with a district as a unit is that it is convenient to lead the primary market and transform private merchants under the direct leadership of the district Party committee, and at the same time, the funds are concentrated

    为进一步开展城乡物资交流，促进以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，支援国家工业化而奋斗
    ——中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会工作报告
    中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会代主任　程子华各位代表、各位来宾：
    从一九五○年七月全国合作社工作者代表会议成立中华全国合作社联合总社到现在，已经整整四年了。我现在代表全国合作总社临时理事会，向大会报告这四年中间全国供销合作社和消费合作社工作的主要情况和今后应当采取的方针任务，请大会加以审查。
    一、四年来供销、消费合作社工作的主要情况
    四年以前，全国合作社工作者代表会议召开的时候，正当我国经济恢复初期，广大的晚解放区的土地改革刚刚开始进行，经过长期战争破坏和反动统治摧残的国民经济的恢复工作也刚刚开始；调整工商业，平衡国家财政收支，稳定物价，活跃城乡物资交流，“为争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转而斗争”，是当时中国共产党和中央人民政府向全国人民提出的严重任务。那时，全国合作社社员约有两千多万，主要分布在东北、华北和华东已经完成土地改革的老解放区，这些合作社在当时人民经济生活中一般都起了一定的作用，但也有不少合作社在组织建设和业务经营上还没有走上正轨，还缺乏必要的制度和办法。这种情况，显然是不能适应当时国家经济恢复发展的要求和广大劳动人民的需要的。
    一九五○年七月全国合作社工作者代表会议，在中共中央和政务院财政经济委员会直接领导与帮助之下，总结了当时合作社的工作，根据毛主席的指示：“合作社的性质，就是为群众服务，这就是处处要想到群众，为群众打算，把群众的利益放在第一位”，明确指出合作社是劳动群众自己的经济组织，要办好合作社必须强调民主制度，贯彻上级社为下级社服务、基层社为社员服务的方针；同时指出合作社又是在工人阶级领导的国家政权管理之下的经济事业，它必须认真执行国家政策，在组织城乡物资交流及同私商投机行为作斗争中成为国营商业的有力助手。根据这些原则，就规定了要办好合作社必须按照社会主义的办法进行工作，而不能用资本主义的办法。根据这些原则，各级合作社应当成为一个有独立组织系统的群众经济组织，一方面各自独立经营，自负盈亏责任；一方面又贯彻民主集中制原则，下级社服从上级社的领导；在业务经营上不仅要根据国家计划执行一定的经济任务，并应努力改进经营管理，逐步实行经济核算制。当时的代表会议强调指出各地合作社应当按照上述方针和办法进行整理和发展，会议并选出了全国合作社临时的中央领导机关——中华全国合作社联合总社临时理事会，实行对全国合作社的统一领导。
    从那次会议到现在，四年来随着整个国民经济的恢复和发展，供销合作社和消费合作社工作，在中国共产党、人民政府与国营经济的领导扶助之下，在各级社全体职工积极努力和广大社员群众的热忱拥护之下，获得了很大的成就。
    截至今年第一季度，全国共有三二、二六五个基层供销合作社和消费合作社，一三二、三四九个零售店和三五、○五六个流动的零售组织。社员共有一六四、三八五、七三七人，较一九五○年增加了八倍多。到一九五三年底，各级社自有资金较一九五○年增加了十九点五倍，社员股金也增加了十点七倍。
    一九五三年全国合作社的商品供销总额比一九五○年增加了九点九倍。一九五四年上半年零售计划超额完成百分之十点一；收购计划超额完成百分之十点四，都比一九五三年同期增加一倍以上。
    一九五三年全年合作社商品零售占市场零售总额的百分之二十五点七三，在城市占百分之十八点一六，在农村占百分之二十九点六九。在工作发展较早的地区，合作社占农村市场零售总额的百分之五十至八十，已基本上占领了农村市场。
    一九五三年合作社在农村的供应业务中，生产资料占百分之十五点九，生活资料占百分之八十四点一。在供应农村生产资料中，过去主要是商品肥料，最近一、二年来新旧农具、农药、药械的经营比重逐渐有了增加，并开始了牲畜和饲料的经营。
    一九五三年合作社在收购业务中，代国家收购占百分之七十五点四；国家需要掌握的商品，如粮食、棉花、麻、烟、茶、丝和羊毛等主要工业原料和出口物资，已经全部或绝大部分通过合作社收购。一九五三年年底实行粮食、油料的计划收购和计划供应以来，合作社更成为国家进行这一繁重工作的主要依靠。
    四年来，由于供销合作社和消费合作社在组织上和业务上的巨大发展，已形成了一个遍布全国各地的新型贸易网，已日益成为我国人民经济生活中的一个重要组成部分。它对于几年来国民经济的恢复和发展，特别是对于农业的恢复和发展起了显著的作用。它不仅在稳定物价和开展城乡物资交流中成为国营商业的有力助手，不仅在供应生产和生活资料，减除私商中间剥削上成为劳动人民不可缺少的经济组织；并且巩固扩大了社会主义经济的领导力量，缩小了资本主义商业在农村的阵地，促进了农村互助合作运动的发展，从而有助于工农联盟的巩固。同时，经过几年来工作的发展，也积累了经验，培养和锻炼了几十万干部，增加了社会主义的资金积累，为今后更进一步的健全发展打下了基础。所有这些事实，说明了四年来我们工作的发展是符合于中国共产党七届二中全会和七届三中全会决议的精神，符合于一九五○年全国合作社工作者代表会议所提出的方针的。
    但同时应当指出，四年来我们的工作曾发生过不少的缺点和错误。主要地表现在：
    第一，对于供销合作社必须为农业生产服务的方针不够明确，认识上不完全一致，贯彻执行也不够坚决有力。在生产资料供应方面，几年来主要力量集中于油饼和化学肥料的供应，对于旧式农具和土制肥料的经营重视不足，对于新式农具和农药、药械曾过分强调困难，在经营上不够积极。对于农产品的预购合同和结合合同制度的重要意义认识不足，未注意系统总结和推广，一九五三年合同制度的推行曾一度陷于自流状态。
    第二，存在着不同程度的资本主义经营思想，愿意经营那些利润比较高或比较容易经营的大城市工业品和大宗土特产，对于那些利润比较小或经营比较困难，但为广大农村生产、生活所需要的手工业品和小土产则不愿积极经营；上级社和下级社，产地和销地合作社之间有互争利润，隐瞒或虚报成本，不严格遵守合同信用的现象。同时，由于对群众需要和市场情况的调查研究不够，业务经营中的盲目性很大；在经营管理上也存在着严重的供给制思想，不重视核算和合理积累，财务监督管理不严，劳动效率低，非生产开支比例高，以及财物保管缺乏责任制等，因而影响了合作社的合理积累，甚至若干社有赔钱现象。
    第三，对国营商业的领导不够尊重，在若干工作中有对立情绪和某种程度的分散主义。最突出的表现是一九五二年至一九五三年一度建立了同国营商业不分商品种类完全平行的工业品批发系统，这不仅影响了国营商业对于批发市场的统一掌握，并且也阻碍了合作社面向地方货源这个方针的贯彻。
    第四，不少地区的合作社民主管理还很差；不重视举行社员大会或代表大会，理事会监事会没有发挥它们应有的作用；不少干部缺乏民主作风和正确的服务态度。
    第五，忽视政治工作，对于提高干部，特别是业务干部的政治思想水平重视不够，通过业务向社员群众进行爱国主义和集体主义的宣传教育也做得很差。
    所有这些缺点和错误都是和全国合作总社临时理事会领导上的主观主义和官僚主义分不开的。由于中共中央及时地给予我们正确的指示和帮助，几年来这些缺点和错误已经不断地得到纠正；但不是所有这些缺点和错误在一切地方在一切干部中都已完全纠正了，相反地这些缺点和错误在不少的地方和不少的干部中，仍然不同程度地存在着，还需要我们继续努力加以克服。
    二、过渡时期供销合作社的基本任务
    毛主席明确指示：“从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。党在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这条总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔，各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或‘左’倾的错误。”
    为了实现上述毛主席所指示的国家过渡时期的总任务，为了把我国建设成为社会主义国家，其基本环节是实现国家的社会主义工业化，并且必须首先集中主要力量发展重工业。我们必须认识以发展重工业为中心的国家社会主义工业化的极端重要的意义，认识它是全国人民的最高利益。
    为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，农业经济必须有相适应的发展。但目前我国农业经济还是分散的、落后的小农经济占优势，它不仅限制着农业生产力的提高，同时也滋长着资本主义的自发势力，同国家的计划建设的要求相矛盾。要克服小农经济同社会主义工业化的矛盾，就必须通过合作化的道路对农业进行社会主义改造。
    供销合作社是农村合作化的三种形式之一（农业生产互助合作是主要的形式），是社会主义性质的群众性的商业组织，是党和政府联系广大农民和巩固工农联盟的一个桥梁。过去几年来的发展，已经显示出它对农村经济和整个国民经济所起的重要作用。为了在总路线这座灯塔的照耀下更好地进行工作和充分发挥自己的应有作用，供销合作社在过渡时期应该明确并贯彻执行以下三个基本任务：
    第一，通过供销业务，开展城乡物资交流，为农业生产服务，以支援国家工业化，并巩固工农联盟；
    第二，根据国家计划和价格政策，通过有计划的供销业务和合同制度，引导小农经济和个体手工业逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，并促进其社会主义改造；
    第三，在国营商业领导机关的领导下，扩大有组织的商品流转，领导农村市场，逐步实现对农村私商的改造，并代替资本主义商业在农村的阵地，逐步切断农民与城市资本主义的联系。
    以上这三个基本任务是密切联系，互相作用的，贯彻这三个基本任务的中心环节是促进农村互助合作运动的发展，为农业生产服务。只有紧紧掌握这一中心环节，才能够有效地促进农村生产力的发展，一方面帮助农民为国家生产出更多的商品粮食、工业原料、出口物资和城市、工矿区所需要的农业和副业产品，另一方面也就提高农民的购买力，扩大工业品的市场，从而支援国家的工业建设。也只有紧紧掌握这一中心环节，供销合作社才能够扩大有组织有计划的城乡物资交流，胜利地逐步代替资本主义商业在农村的阵地，使分散的小农经济和个体手工业逐步与国家计划联结起来，并促进其社会主义改造。而这一切都是为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，把我国建设成为社会主义的国家。
    因此，各级供销合作社干部必须在一切工作中很好地掌握这三个基本任务的精神和实质，树立以国家工业化为主体的社会主义建设的整体思想，善于通过一切业务活动和组织活动将社员群众的局部利益、眼前利益和国家工业化的最高利益结合起来。同时，也必须从农村的实际情况出发，在工作进行的步骤和方式方法上坚持既积极、又稳步的方针，避免盲目冒进。
    三、在城乡市场新的情况下供销合作社必须做好的几项主要工作
    从一九五三年我国开始有计划的经济建设以来，在城乡市场上出现了许多新的情况，其中主要的一点是许多商品供不应求，特别是消费品和农业生产资料的供不应求。这是因为国家大量资金投入经济建设，城市和工矿区人口增加，社会工资总量和农民收入都有了显著的增加，这就使城乡人民购买力在几年来业已提高的基础上有了进一步的增长。社会购买力增长的速度，超过消费品和农业生产资料生产增长的速度，将是在相当长时期内存在的趋势。这是革命胜利后国民经济恢复发展和广大劳动人民生活提高的结果，对于工农业生产的发展也是一个推动力量。
    几年来社会主义国营商业与合作社商业的迅速发展，过渡时期总任务宣传的深入贯彻，计划收购和计划供应政策的实行，以及农村互助合作运动的高涨，所有这些因素也引起了城乡市场和农村经济深刻的变化。
    在许多商品供不应求和城乡市场发生了根本性变化的情况下，进一步扩大有组织有计划的社会商品流转，继续保持市场稳定，是保证国家经济建设的必要前提。因此，供销合作社要实现它在过渡时期的基本任务，就必须适应国内市场和农村经济所出现的这些新的情况和要求，在业务经营上着重做好以下几项主要工作：
    第一，做好国家委托的计划收购和计划供应，并大力开辟地方货源，进一步扩大城乡商品流转。
    根据各地实行的初步经验，各级供销合作社在执行这一重要的国家任务时，首先要协助国家正确地摸清楚计划收购物资的生产量与商品量，要根据国家的规定，在验收、评级、过秤、付款等各方面尽量便利农民，并做好仓储保管和调运工作，要做好物资供应工作，及时供应农民所需要的生产和生活资料，协助国家回笼货币。其次，在担负计划供应工作时，关于供应点的设置以及供应标准和供应办法的规定，供销合作社必须在当地党委、政府和国营商业领导下，认真调查，缜密计划，既要便利群众购买，又要防止供应面过宽、供应量过大，使投机行为无可乘之机；并应做好计划供应物资的合理调拨与必要储备，防止人为的脱销和积压，反对徇私渎职和对群众不负责任的官僚主义作风。同时，供销合作社还要接受国家委托，做好在国家管理之下的没有私商参加的粮食市场的工作，积极组织农民之间的粮食和油脂、油料的相互调剂，解决对村镇食品业和粮食、油料加工业的原料供应。
    计划收购和计划供应只能限于少数主要商品，为适应广大农村日益增长的生产和生活的需要，各级供销合作社必须同时加强一般的供应业务与收购业务，大力组织商品流转，以活跃初级市场，进一步开展城乡物资交流。在供应业务上除积极协助国营商业组织工业品下乡外，并应重视开辟地方货源，扩大手工业品的供应，以补充现代工业产品之不足。在加强生产资料经营的同时，也须注意扩大生活资料的供应，放松任何一方面都是不对的。
    在收购业务上，除保证完成国家收购计划外，并应积极收购农民需要推销的土副产品。各地农村小土产品种很多，分散在千家万户，集中起来，就可以成为一个可观的数量，无论对于增加货源，供应城市、工矿区人民或出口的需要，以及增加农民的收入方面，都是一个重要的工作。过去各地供销合作社对于小土产的收购做得很不够，今后必须加强。
    第二，加强农业生产资料的供应，开展预购合同与结合合同制，促进以互助合作为中心内容的农业增产运动。
    要做好农具、肥料、籽种、饲料等生产资料的供应，必须根据生产季节，根据经济作物区、一般作物区、山地、平原、水地、旱地，以及互助合作发展程度等等不同的情况，切实掌握农村需要的变化规律，既要克服保守观点，也要防止盲目经营的偏向。在货源的组织上应当采取就地取材、就地加工和就地供应为主，地区调剂为辅的方针，多方面依靠群众，发掘当地潜在力量。
    随着互助合作运动的发展，广大农村对于新式农具、大农具、大牲畜和农药、药械的需要必然逐年增加。各级供销合作社必须充分认识经营这些生产资料对于巩固发展互助合作与提高农业生产力的重要意义，密切配合农业部门，积极经营这些业务。经营新式农具和农药、药械在推广阶段是有一定困难的，但必须努力加以克服，也是可以克服的。
    关于牲畜的经营，根据过去经验，主要应当加强领导和改造当地牲畜市场，有计划地组织农民相互调剂。需要向远地采购的，应当在上级社统一组织之下事先与产地联系，有计划地进行采购。
    商品肥料供不应求将是长期的趋势，各地供销合作社应当配合当地党委、政府积极动员农民积蓄自然肥料，并大力经营土制肥料。油饼、化学肥料应该重点供应工业原料作物区和已有使用习惯的粮产区，不宜盲目推广。
    实行预购合同和结合合同制，是促进个体农民组织起来，同时也是把农业生产逐步纳入国家计划轨道的重要方法之一。供销合作社预购农产品，应以农业生产合作社和互助组为主要对象，但对个体农民也可采取适当的办法，实行预购。预购的定金，应该主要用于帮助贫困农民解决生产和生活上的困难，平均分配是不对的。但在收购时，必须做好收回定金的工作；不注意收回定金，使国家资金受到损失，把预购定金看做救济款，也是错误的。对于富农则应实行信用预购，不付定金。
    供销合作社通过结合合同向农民订购农副产品时，合同供应的商品品种，一般地以农具、肥料等主要生产资料为宜，并须作到货源有把握，保证按照合同规定及时供应。包括品种过多，企图将农民需要购买或出售的商品完全通过合同固定下来，经验证明是失败的。
    无论是预购合同或结合合同，在手续上要做到简便易行，认真履行合同信用。对于订立合同的农民除加强关于遵守合同信用的宣传教育外，并应注意通过日常供销业务，帮助他们克服生产、生活上的困难，以保证合同的顺利实现。
    第三，积极和手工业建立有计划的供销关系，增加手工业品的货源，并促进对手工业的社会主义改造。
    供销合作社扶助手工业生产，应当根据国家和人民的需要，有计划地发展农业生产资料和城乡人民生活用品的生产，发展可供出口的手工艺制造业。
    供销合作社对于分散的个体手工业，主要应当采取加工订货办法，有计划地供应他们所需要的原料和收购他们的产品，帮助他们克服淡季困难，并指导他们改进产品规格质量，扩大产品销路。这样，不仅使供销合作社的货源有了保证，并且可以使个体手工业者感到与供销合作社结合的好处，逐步摆脱资本主义商业和高利贷的剥削，走上合作化道路。
    对已经组织起来的手工业生产合作社组织，供销合作社更应该同它们密切结合，并在互助两利的原则下实行合同经营，以促进其巩固和发展。在作价问题上，应本互助合作精神，公开成本，在生产利润应大于商业利润的原则下，协商订出合理的差价分配比例。
    第四，加强对加工企业的管理，充分发挥它们潜在的生产能力。
    到一九五三年底，全国各级合作社附设的加工企业共有一一、七六六个，职工二十一万八千人，一九五三年生产总值比一九五○年增加五点五倍；其中比较大型的有一、九五六个，职工十三万八千人，动力四万八千匹马力。这无论对于增加社会总生产量和对于供销合作社业务的发展，都是一个不可忽视的重要力量。过去我们对于这一工作重视不足，许多加工企业单位无论在生产管理或企业经营上都存在着不少的问题。
    为了进一步适应农产品加工的需要和扩大供应商品的货源，以补充国家工业生产之不足，今后各级供销合作社理事会必须加强对所属各加工企业单位的领导和管理，在当地财委统一计划之下切实掌握它们的生产计划并监督它们贯彻执行；具备条件的加工企业单位应实行独立核算，以加强企业管理，充分发挥潜在的生产能力。但各地需要扩建或新建加工企业时，则必须慎重制订计划，报经当地财委和上级社审查批准，防止盲目发展。
    第五，在国营商业领导机关统一领导下积极领导初级市场和改造私商。
    在过渡时期总任务的宣传，在实行粮食、油料的计划收购和计划供应以后，农村市场所发生的巨大变化，主要表现在自由市场日益缩小，合作社营业额在市场总营业额中所占比重迅速上升，私商比重急剧下降，国营商业组织城乡交流和广大农民的一买一卖都更加需要依靠合作社，因而用新的社会主义交流渠道代替旧的资本主义交流渠道的必要性是更加明显了。在这种情况之下，就需要对私商的出路有适当的安排，正确地坚决地贯彻国家对他们的利用、限制和改造的政策。因此，根据最近政务院财政经济委员会的决定，今后供销合作社必须在国营商业领导机关的统一领导下，积极担负起领导初级市场和改造私商的重大责任。供销合作社考虑本身的工作发展时，必须同时考虑初级市场的全面安排，充分利用市场关系变化和改组的有利条件，采取一面前进、一面安排和前进一行、安排一行的办法，对农村私商积极地稳步地进行社会主义改造。除一部分必须和可能转业的以外，一般地应逐步把私营商业改造成为各种形式的国家资本主义商业；至于其中某些成员，则经过改造之后，也可以吸收做为合作社的职工。
    领导初级市场和改造私商是一个十分繁重的工作。各级社、特别是省社必须加强对县社和基层社的具体领导，加强对干部的思想教育和政策教育。关于农村市场的价格政策、公私比重的安排以及对各种不同类型的私商所应该采取的具体政策和办法等，必须服从当地党委、政府和国营商业领导机关的统一领导。
    在供销合作社业务日益扩大，零售网与收购网深入各乡各村并逐步代替私商的条件下，农村原有集镇的作用确实起了显著的变化。但是，国家管理的粮食市场，合作社的大型商店、专业商店、加工企业以及农民之间的交换，手工业生产等，都仍是以集镇为中心的。因此，各地供销合作社在领导初级市场和改造私商的过程中，应当同时注意农村集镇的建设工作，在当地党委和政府的领导之下，根据当地农村经济发展的需要，有计划地把集镇由资本主义联系农村的经济据点改造为社会主义联系农村的经济据点，使之成为城乡交流的新的枢纽，在同进一步组织农村经济生活中发挥它应有的作用。
    第六，认真执行国家价格政策、协助国营商业作好物价工作。
    为了协助国营商业在许多商品供不应求的情况下有计划地指导生产和消费，稳定市场和改造私商，各地供销合作社必须认真贯彻国家价格政策，在价格工作上同国营商业步调一致。
    关于农副产品的收购价格，凡国营商业已规定牌价者都必须严格遵守，按牌价收购，并应注意调查研究这些产品的生产成本、农民对牌价的反映和私商的活动；如发现规定的牌价有不当之处，应积极向国营商业提出意见，但不能随便改变牌价。对于国营商业所不经营，不规定牌价的小土产、手工业品和生产资料，各地供销合作社也应认真研究它们的合理比价，慎重提出收购价格方案，报经当地财委批准后实行。
    合作社在农村的零售价格，凡属计划供应的商品和代国营商业销售的商品，必须严格执行国家价格；其他商品，当地如有国营商店，应当同国家牌价取得一致（个别地区一时还不能取消对社员的优待价格者除外）；当地没有国营商店，可参照附近地区国营商店的牌价和对私商的政策慎重规定零售价格，报当地财委核准后实行。
    对于社员实行价格上优待的办法，在供销合作社发展初期和物价不稳定时期，是有它的一定作用的。但为了减少经营管理上的困难，不影响合作社合理的积累和便于领导农村市场、安排私商，这种办法现在就不宜再继续下去了。在合作社组织的发展已经达到或接近饱和点，社员和非社员的区别已经基本上不存在的地区，应当即时取消这种优待制度。就是在还需要发展组织的个别地区，如立即取消这种优待制度还有困难，也应很好地向社员宣传解释，减少优待品种，缩小对非社员的差价，争取在短期内逐步取消。为密切社员同合作社关系，区别社员与非社员，应当采取少数几种特定的商品实行廉价定量供应或给社员以优先权，以及适当分红，举办某些福利设施等办法。
    四、改善经营管理，逐步推行经济核算制
    供销合作社是经济事业和企业组织，它所担负的各项任务都必须通过供销业务活动，才能具体实现。因此就必须抓紧改善经营管理，逐步推行经济核算制这一个重要环节。目前各地各级合作社的业务经营中，盲目性大，计划性和组织性差，劳动组织不合理，经营技术差，资财混乱，非生产开支比例高和不注意合理积累与经营亏损等现象是严重的，如不大力加以扭转，今后整个供销合作社工作是难于巩固和提高的。
    首先，加强调查研究工作，加强统计制度，系统地深入地了解群众需要、市场情况与合作社工作进行情况，建立必要的统计制度，并在这一基础上正确地制订计划，认真按计划办事，以逐步加强计划管理，克服业务经营的盲目性。
    第二，改善企业管理机构，逐步实行专责分工的责任制度，改变目前行政人员过多，劳动效率低和无人负责的状况。要做到这一点，在供应业务上当前的重要环节是实行“拨货计价、实物负责制”。并应注意改进贸易组织与技术，从商店设置、货物销售、采购、调拨、储备到仓库保管各个经营环节都应当订出切实可行的制度，不断研究改进办法，提高经营技术。
    在农业和副业产品收购方面，要努力提高检验技术，正确地贯彻分等论价、优级优价政策，并在便利农民的原则下做好验级、入仓和保管等工作。
    第三，加强财务管理和会计核算。在必须保证完成业务计划的前提下努力加速周转，不断减低流转费用，增加合理积累。
    计划管理和经济核算制是社会主义企业的管理制度，根据目前各地工作发展不平衡的情况，在账表积压、财务混乱的地区应首先做好清理整顿工作，为逐步实行经济核算制创造条件；在已有条件的地区应先行试点，稳步推行。但必须注意：实行这一社会主义企业的经营管理制度，必须树立全面的核算观点，反对破坏政策的本位思想和单纯利润观点。
    五、适当调整基层供销合作社的组织形式，加强民主管理制度
    一九五一年全国合作总社提出农村基层社组织形式应当根据经济区划兼顾行政区划的原则，一般应以集镇为中心进行建社，在集镇稀少的地区，可以大村为中心。有些地区也曾经实行以乡或以区为单位建社。这种主要根据经济区划建社的组织形式是符合于经济恢复时期发展合作社商业网，组织城乡物资交流，稳定物价以及同投机私商作斗争的要求的。现在国家已进入有计划的社会主义建设和有系统的社会主义改造时期，为了便于在党委的统一领导下，使生产合作、供销合作、信用合作和计划收购与计划供应工作四个方面密切结合，以实现对小农经济的改造，基层供销合作社的组织形式应当采取主要根据行政区划，兼顾经济区划的原则，以便于党委的统一领导。
    以乡或几个乡为单位建社的好处，是便于群众民主监督，便于同农业生产互助合作组织密切结合。但为了领导初级市场和改造私商，为了解决以乡为单位建社的资金少、业务规模小和难于满足群众需要的困难，凡是以乡为单位建社的地区，应当有计划地在大集镇上成立中心社，归镇委或区委领导，县社也可以根据需要在大集镇设立供销站，以加强对乡社的供销批发业务。
    以区为单位建社的好处，是便于在区委直接领导下领导初级市场和改造私商，同时资金集中，经营商品种类比较齐全，有利于经济核算；但缺点是不便于群众民主监督。因此，凡以区为单位建社的地区就必须根据群众需要，有计划地在各乡设立分销店，并按乡定期召开社员代表会议，加强商店委员会的工作；或按乡成立分社。
    在地广人稀地区（例如内蒙），也可以按自治县（旗）建社，并根据当地群众需要情况和经济条件，有计划地发展流动供销组织。
    基层社组织形式的调整，各地具体情况不同，不宜强求统一。无论是分建小社或并为大社，都必须经过社员代表大会充分讨论通过后才能实行，绝不能以简单行政命令强制实行。同时，还需要做好账务结算与资财处理工作，并注意不影响业务的正常进行。
    供销合作社是劳动人民自愿联合组织起来的自己的商业组织，它与国营商业不同，正因如此，供销合作社必须充分发挥它的群众性和健全民主管理制度，使供销合作社真正成为党和政府联系广大群众的桥梁，成为对于农民进行集体主义教育的学校，教育他们关心集体利益，积极参加公共经济的管理，从而有助于农业生产互助合作运动的发展。目前供销合作社工作的严重缺点之一，恰恰就在于不少合作社干部对于这一问题的重要意义认识不足，以致许多地区的合作社忽视民主管理，群众性很差；不少合作社的理事会与监事会形同虚设，很少按期举行社员代表大会向社员报告工作、公布账目和通过业务计划；不少合作社干部有脱离群众的官僚主义和强迫命令作风，缺乏正确的服务态度。同时，在业务经营上的盲目性和资本主义经营思想，显然和这一严重缺点也是有密切关系的。供销合作社要充分发挥它的应有作用，胜利地实现它在过渡时期的基本任务，就必须坚决地改变这一严重状况。
    第一，各地供销合作社应以供销合作社章程为中心内容对社员群众进行广泛的深入的关于合作社的宣传教育，使每一社员都能认识合作社是他们自己的商业组织，社员是合作社的主人，应该积极参加对合作社的监督管理，使合作社能够认真按照章程和社员的集体意见办事。
    第二，必须按期召开社员大会或社员代表大会，重大的组织、业务和财务问题必须经过社员大会或代表大会通过，使社员大会或代表大会确实成为合作社的最高权力机关。各级合作社的理、监事会必须按章程由社员大会或代表大会选举产生，并按章程进行改选。理事会必须名符其实，真正起到集体领导的作用。监事会和商店委员会的工作必须加强。任何工作干部凡为社员所不满，代表大会要求撤换者必须坚决撤换。
    第三，社员参加合作社或退社必须坚持自愿原则。
    第四，实行适当的分红制度，加强合作社的文化福利工作，加强对社员的宣传教育，以增进社员对合作社的关心。
    六、关于城市消费合作社的工作
    到一九五三年底全国城市消费合作社共有一、八六八个，零售店一○、二○六个，社员一○、七七二、三九一人。四年来消费合作社在国营商业领导机关的领导和支持之下，在执行主要商品的社会分配任务，反对私商投机和稳定物价的斗争中，对于保护工人阶级和劳动人民的劳动所得，改善他们的生活和巩固他们的生产情绪等方面，是起了重大作用的，已经成为城市劳动人民日常生活中重要的依靠。同时，通过合作社有组织的供应，也使部分分散的消费需要和国家计划联结起来。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于各地党委、政府的正确领导和各级消费合作社干部的辛勤努力。应当指出，全国合作总社几年来对于城市消费合作社的工作是重视不足的，缺乏应有的领导和帮助。
    由于目前国内市场发生若干新的情况，商业战线上的斗争日益复杂，工作任务日益繁重，为了统一步调，便于掌握市场和实现对私商利用、限制和改造的政策，同时也为了进一步加强供销合作社和消费合作社的工作，政务院财政经济委员会根据国营商业同合作社实行城乡分工的原则，决定城市消费合作社工作划归国营商业领导机关直接领导，先从大、中城市开始，逐步实行转移。今后省社和全国总社将集中力量领导供销合作社工作，这样的安排，是完全适合当前形势发展的需要的。
    同时也需要指出，在实行这样分工之后，各地供销合作社仍应根据支援城市供应的方针，以自营的小土产品积极供应城市消费合作社，以补充国营商业货源之不足。
    七、加强政治工作，加强培养和训练干部
    为使合作社的业务工作和组织工作健全发展，保证合作社的基本任务的贯彻实现，做好政治工作是个重要的关键。各级合作社理事会必须把加强政治工作做为推动一切工作的动力，使国家过渡时期的总任务、国家的政策和合作社的基本任务都能密切结合每一项业务活动与组织活动具体地体现出来。
    对于合作社全体职工的政治工作，主要是结合各项工作加强思想政治教育，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，使他们深刻认识他们所担负的每项工作任务对于整个合作社事业以及国家的社会主义建设事业的政治意义，从而高度发挥他们的积极性与创造性，使每一个职工都能有饱满的政治热情，为完成和超额完成任务而全力以赴。
    对于广大社员群众（主要是农民）的政治工作，主要是通过各项具体业务和组织工作，经常有系统地进行关于合作社的教育和国家各项政策的宣传，以提高农民的政治觉悟，动员他们参加对合作社的监督管理，培养他们的集体主义思想和习惯。
    农村私商是供销合作社逐步代替和改造的对象。各级供销合作社在执行这一任务的过程中，也必须对农村私商进行必要的可能的政治工作，使他们正确地了解国家的政策。在把他们改造成为国家资本主义的零售商以后，关于如何继续改造他们的经营管理，如何合理划分供应网，如何防止他们掺杂掺假，反对他们制造黑市，以及如何监督他们遵守经销和代销的各种规章制度等等方面，也还都是不可避免地需要进行经常的和长远的斗争的。特别是将来还要把农村私商从业人员的一部分逐步改造成为合作社的职工，这就要求我们今后必须以更大的努力系统地进行教育训练和思想改造的工作。
    合作社的政治工作与供销业务是密切不可分离的。应当根据国家过渡时期总任务和供销合作社基本任务，结合不同业务，按照不同对象和担负不同职务的工作人员，确定不同的宣传教育内容和方式方法。各级合作社必须在当地党委的统一领导和部署之下，善于按照各个部门的工作性质与任务，动员全体干部力量去加强政治工作。
    现在在全国各级合作社工作的干部有八十七万八千多人，绝大多数是在解放之后才参加工作的，有三十四万工作人员是在一九五二年“三反”之后才参加工作的。我们的干部绝大部分是好的，而且是在积极努力工作。但现有干部的政治水平和业务水平，无论一般干部或领导干部，都还同合作社所担负的艰巨任务不相适应。几年来各级社办的干部学校、训练班共训练过三十八万多人，主要的是会计、统计和农产品检验等一般业务干部，对于基层社主任和各级社领导干部的训练工作做得比较少。今后各省干部学校或训练班应当有计划地抽调基层社和县社的主任参加短期轮训，全国总社的干部学校应着重培养师资和训练各省社处长以上的干部。对于各项专业干部的训练，也应有计划地继续进行。各级合作社理事会都应重视在职干部的政治、业务和文化学习，加强对这一工作的领导。
    对于在几年之内发展起来的这几十万工作干部的庞大队伍，如何有系统地进行审查和管理，保证我们队伍的纯洁，如何在不断加强培养和训练的基础上正确地进行选拔和配备，以充分发挥我们的战斗力量，显然是一个极端重要的工作。各级合作社必须在当地党委的领导下，大力加强这方面的工作。
    八、紧紧依靠党的领导，加强团结，转变我们的领导作风和工作作风，为胜利地实现供销合作社的基本任务而奋斗
    同志们！斯大林教导我们：“当正确路线已经提出来了的时候，当问题已经正确决定了的时候，事业底成功就要取决于组织工作，取决于组织斗争来实现党的路线，取决于正确挑选人材，取决于审查各领导机关决议执行情形”。又指出：“我们经济工作领导者不是‘一般地’领导企业，不是‘从空中’领导企业，而是具体切实地领导企业……要精通工作技术，熟悉工作详情，熟悉‘小事情’”。对于目前各级合作社的领导状况来说，这一指示显然具有十分迫切的现实意义。
    健全各级合作社的领导，转变目前严重存在的官僚主义与主观主义作风，应当紧紧掌握以下几个环节：第一、必须深入地了解下级社，特别是基层社的实际情况；第二、要严格实行责任制度，明确每一个工作部门和每一个干部的职责和具体工作任务，明确执行任务的政策界线；第三、正确地制定计划，并系统地检查计划执行情况，及时发现问题，及时解决问题；第四、重视下级社的经验，认真培养典型，并有系统地进行总结和推广。要做到这些，每一领导干部就必须真正熟悉业务，“熟悉小事情”，“学会管理经济，学会文明经商”（列宁）。同时，并应结合实际认真地学习苏联先进经验。只有如此，才能切实转变我们的领导作风和工作作风，不断地提高我们的工作质量。
    健全各级合作社领导的最根本的关键在于紧紧依靠各级党委的领导，加强请示报告制度，保证党和国家政策的正确贯彻，坚决反对分散主义和本位主义倾向。为了保证合作社基本任务的完成，还必须依靠合作社全体干部，尤其是领导干部的团结一致，必须充分发扬民主，加强批评和自我批评，坚持集体领导制度，一切重要问题都应集思广益，经过会议充分讨论，防止个人决定重大问题的不良倾向。
    同志们！供销合作社已经是这样庞大的经济事业，我们的任务是这样的繁重，我们几年来已经作了的一些工作，但距离党与人民的要求还差得很远，缺点错误还很多。因此，各级合作社必须教育每一个干部谦虚谨慎，防止和反对任何骄傲自满情绪，紧紧依靠党的领导，加强团结，密切联系社员群众，虚心听取群众意见，不断地改正我们工作中的缺点和错误，以忘我的工作精神，忠心耿耿地为贯彻供销合作社在过渡时期的基本任务，支援国家的社会主义工业化而努力奋斗。
