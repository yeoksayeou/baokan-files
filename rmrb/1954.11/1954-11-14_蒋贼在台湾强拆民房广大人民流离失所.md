(Xinhua News Agency, 13th) Under the guise of so-called "military needs" and "eliminating illegal constructions," the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is forcibly demolishing civilian houses throughout Taiwan, forcing tens of thousands of Taiwanese compatriots to be impoverished and displaced.

According to reports from Taiwan and Hong Kong newspapers, in Caoshan, a scenic area in the suburbs of Taipei, where the traitor Chiang Kai-shek resides, many civilian houses have recently been forcibly demolished. The Chiang gang violently drove away over ten thousand poor farmers living there and seized their land to rebuild barracks for the American military. More than two thousand households engaged in small-scale industry and commerce on Roosevelt Road in Taipei have also been labeled "illegal constructions" by the Chiang gang, ordered to be demolished within a time limit, forcing over sixteen thousand residents to "face the serious crisis of bankruptcy and displacement." In Keelung City, fourteen residences belonging to residents such as Lai Ming on Nanrong Road were forcibly demolished by the Chiang gang's Keelung City government under the pretext of "land requisition." Many atrocities of Chiang gang personnel forcibly demolishing civilian houses have also occurred in other towns in Taiwan.

Because the measure of forcibly demolishing civilian houses has met with opposition from residents, the Chiang gang has intensified its efforts and implemented a new measure called "Eliminating Illegal Constructions" in October. It stipulates that each county and city in Taiwan shall form so-called "Illegal Construction Handling Groups" composed of representatives from the Chiang gang's local governments, military, police, gendarmes, and "public opinion representatives" to demolish civilian houses in large numbers using violence. When homeowners avoid the fierce demolition personnel of the Chiang gang, the Chiang gang stipulates that the property in the demolished houses will be seized under the reasons of so-called "unable to return to its owner" and "unable to keep on their behalf for a long time." While carrying out large-scale forced demolition of civilian houses, the Chiang gang also stipulates that "absolutely no new illegal constructions shall be allowed to occur in the future." As a result, hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese compatriots are unable to build new houses elsewhere after their houses are forcibly demolished.

Under the violent measures of the Chiang gang, more and more Taiwanese compatriots have suffered catastrophe. The forced demolition of the house of Su Yulan, a resident of Liyi Street in Taichung City, is a tragic example. Su Yulan is a poor widow raising five minor children, and her simple shack had been built for nine years. But in October, Su Yulan suddenly received a notice from the Chiang gang's Taichung City government, insisting that her house was an "illegal construction" and forcing her to dismantle it quickly and voluntarily. Threatened with bankruptcy, Su Yulan could not help but cry bitterly and went to the Chiang gang's Taichung City government to beg for a postponement of the demolition. However, when she returned home, her house had already been completely demolished by the Chiang gang's Taichung City government personnel and Chiang gang military police, and the six members of the mother and children's family immediately fell into a desperate situation where they could not find food or shelter.

The Chiang gang's extremely vicious forced demolition of civilian houses has aroused public anger among Taiwanese compatriots. Taiwan newspapers reported that although the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique often dispatched large teams of Chiang gang troops, police, and gendarmes when implementing the brutal measure of forcibly demolishing civilian houses, it still inevitably led to "frequent disputes" and caused citizens to "discuss it endlessly."

    蒋贼在台湾强拆民房广大人民流离失所
    【新华社十三日讯】在所谓“军事需要”和“取缔违章建筑”的名义下，蒋介石卖国集团正在台湾各地强拆民房，迫使成千成万台湾同胞破家荡产，流离失所。
    据台湾和香港报纸报道，在卖国贼蒋介石霸居的台北市郊风景区——草山，最近有许多民房被强拆。蒋贼用暴力赶走了在那里的一万多个贫苦的农民，把屋地霸占来改建美军的营房。在台北市罗斯福路经营小本工商业的二千多户房屋，也被蒋贼列为“违章建筑”，限期强令拆除，迫使一万六千多居民“面临破家荡产的严重关头”。基隆市南荣路居民赖明等十四幢住宅，被蒋贼基隆市政府以“征收土地”为名迫令拆除。台湾其他市镇也发生了许多蒋贼人员强拆民房的暴行。
    由于强拆民房的措施受到了居民的反对，蒋贼竟变本加厉地在十月份施行了一个“取缔违章建筑”的新办法，规定台湾各县、市都由蒋贼地方政府、军队、警察、宪兵的代表和“民意代表”等组成所谓“违章建筑处理小组”，用暴力来大量拆除各地民房；当屋主因逃避蒋贼拆屋人员的凶焰而避开时，蒋贼规定以所谓“无法交还其所有人”和“不能代为长久保管”的理由来劫夺被拆除的房屋中的财物。蒋贼在大规模强拆民房的同时，还规定今后“绝对禁止再有新违章建筑发生”，因而成千上万台湾同胞在房屋被强迫拆除后，无法在别的地方另盖房屋栖身。
    在蒋贼的狂暴措施下，愈来愈多的台湾同胞遭到了浩劫。台中市礼仪街居民苏玉兰的家屋被强拆，就是一个悲惨的例子。苏玉兰是一个抚养五个未成年儿女的贫穷寡妇，她的简陋的棚屋盖成已有九年。但在十月间，苏玉兰突然接到蒋贼台中市政府的通知，硬说她的房屋是“违章建筑”，迫令迅速自动拆除。苏玉兰受到破家荡产的威胁，不禁痛哭起来，并到蒋贼台中市政府去苦苦要求暂缓拆屋，然而当她转回家时，房屋却已经被蒋贼台中市政府人员和蒋贼军警全部拆光了，母子六口立即陷入了食宿无着的绝境。
    蒋贼穷凶极恶强拆民房，已引起台湾同胞的公愤。台湾报纸报道，蒋介石卖国集团在执行强拆民房的横暴措施时，虽然经常出动大队蒋贼军队、警察和宪兵，但仍不免“纠纷丛生”，并使市民们
  “议论不已”。
