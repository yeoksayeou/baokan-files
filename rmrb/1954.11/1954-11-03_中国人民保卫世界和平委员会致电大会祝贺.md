The China Peace Committee sends a congratulatory telegram to the Conference:

To the British Peace Committee and to be forwarded to the British Conference for the Defence of International Security:

    At the initiative of the British Peace Committee and peace-loving people from all walks of life in Britain, the British Conference for the Defence of International Security is about to open in London on October 31st. The China Peace Committee, on behalf of the Chinese people, extends heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Conference and all participating representatives.

    In the past few years, the British people have made outstanding contributions to the struggle for the maintenance of world peace. The convening of the British Conference for the Defence of International Security will mark a further effort by the British people for the cause of world peace.

    At present, opposing the rearmament of West Germany in any form, striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany, and demanding disarmament, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of collective peace in Europe, are major issues related to the security of the world, especially Europe, and are also the common peaceful aspirations that the people of Europe and the world demand to realize. We are deeply convinced that on the basis of the increasing unity of the British people for peace and security, this Conference will make new and greater contributions.

    We Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the peace efforts of the British people. Let us wish the Conference complete success in its efforts for lasting peace and universal security in Europe and the world; and we wish that the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and British people in the cause of peace will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    China Peace Committee
    October 25, 1954

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电大会祝贺英国和平委员会并转英国保卫国际安全大会：
    在英国和平委员会和英国各界和平人士倡议之下，英国保卫国际安全大会即将于十月三十一日在伦敦开幕，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会谨代表中国人民，向大会及与会全体代表，致以衷心的祝贺和敬意。
    几年来英国人民在维护世界和平的斗争中曾经作了卓越的贡献，英国保卫国际安全大会的召开将标志着英国人民为世界和平事业而作进一步努力的表现。
    目前反对以任何形式重新武装西德、谋求德国和平统一以及要求裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭性武器和建立欧洲集体和平，是关系世界首先是欧洲安全的重大问题，也是欧洲及世界人民所共同要求实现的和平愿望。我们深信，在英国人民为和平和安全而日益团结的基础上，这次大会定将作出新的、更大的贡献。
    我们中国人民一贯同情和支持英国人民的和平努力，让我们预祝大会在为欧洲及世界的持久和平和普遍安全的努力中获致圆满成功；并祝中英两国人民在和平事业中的友好合作日益巩固和发展。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
