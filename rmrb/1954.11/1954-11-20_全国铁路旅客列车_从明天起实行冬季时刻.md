To adapt to the winter climate and the development of passenger traffic, national railway passenger trains will implement a winter timetable starting at 00:00 on November 21. This timetable change is to further meet the travel needs of the people. According to passenger flow requirements, some lines have increased the number of trains, and some trains have been appropriately extended. For example, in response to the request of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Beijing-Baotou lines 221 and 222 (train numbers changed to 109 and 110) have been extended to Hohhot. To accommodate the relocation of the capital of Jilin Province to Changchun and to meet the needs of general passengers, the express trains 33 and 34 between Beijing and Shenyang have been extended to Changchun. To facilitate passengers transferring to express trains at Tianjin Station (because express trains 11 and 13 from Beijing are often full), a pair of express trains has been added between Tianjin and Shenyang. Since the double-track of the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line has been fully completed, the trains that originally detoured through the Gaoxin and Xinyi lines will now run on the main line (Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line), which can shorten passengers' travel time by two hours.

    全国铁路旅客列车
    从明天起实行冬季时刻
    为适应冬季气候和客流量的发展，全国铁路旅客列车自十一月二十一日零点起实行冬季时刻。此次变点，为进一步满足广大人民乘车便利，根据客流需要，有些线增加了列车次数，并将有的列车适当延长，如接受内蒙古自治区的要求，已将京包线二二一、二次（车次变为一○九、一一○次）延长至呼和浩特；为照顾吉林省会迁移长春和满足一般旅客需要，将北京沈阳间三十三、四次快车延长至长春；为照顾旅客在天津站换乘快车（因北京开十一、十三次快车常满员）的便利增开了天津沈阳间快车一对。由于沈山线的复线已全线修通，原来从高新、新义线绕道的列车改走正线
  （沈山线），可以缩短旅客两小时的乘车时间。
