Comrade Ambassador, dear comrades and friends:

    Today is the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. With extremely joyous feelings, I represent the Chinese people and the Chinese government in extending warm congratulations to you, Comrade Ambassador, and through you to the great Soviet people and the Soviet government.
    The great victory of the October Revolution, achieved by the great Soviet people under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party, fundamentally changed human history. The Soviet Union built the first socialist country in the world, and is now confidently and rapidly advancing towards the most noble ideal of mankind—a communist society. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the great Soviet people on the unparalleled and brilliant achievements they have made in building communism.
    The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy—a policy of firmly safeguarding and consolidating peace, a policy of struggling against the preparation and launching of new wars, a policy of international cooperation and developing affairs with all countries—is completely in line with the interests of the vast majority of people in the world. In recent years, the realization of the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina have gradually eased international tensions, and the Soviet Union's consistent and active efforts have been a major factor. The people of the world are increasingly convinced that the Soviet Union is the strongest bastion for maintaining world peace and human justice.
    The Chinese people cherish the profound friendship with our great ally, the Soviet Union. This profound friendship not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but will also affect the future of mankind. The recent talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union mark a new development in the great friendship between the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, and once again reflect the Soviet government and people’s lofty internationalist concern and assistance for the Chinese people's socialist construction cause. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people. I firmly believe that the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union will play an even greater and inestimable role in promoting the common prosperity of our two countries and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
    Long live the 37th anniversary

    朱德副主席的讲话亲爱的大使同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年纪念，我以极为愉快的心情代表中国人民和中国政府向您，大使同志，并通过您向伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府表示热烈的祝贺。
    伟大的苏联人民，在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下所取得的十月革命的伟大胜利，使人类历史发生了根本的转变。苏联在世界上建成了第一个社会主义国家，目前又正在满怀信心地、大踏步地向着人类最崇高的理想——共产主义社会胜利前进。中国人民热诚地祝贺伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义事业中所获得的无比光辉的成就。
    苏联的和平外交政策——坚定不移地维护和巩固和平的政策，为反对准备和发动新战争而斗争的政策，国际合作和同一切国家发展事务联系的政策，是完全符合于全世界广大人民的利益。近年来朝鲜停战和印度支那和平的实现使国际紧张局势逐渐缓和，苏联的一贯积极努力是一个重大的因素。全世界人民愈益坚信：苏联是维护世界和平与人类正义的最强大的堡垒。
    中国人民异常珍视同伟大盟邦苏联的深厚友谊，这种深厚的友谊，不仅符合中苏两国人民的利益，而且会影响人类的将来。最近中苏两国政府的会谈，更标志着中苏八亿人民的伟大友谊的新发展，再一次体现了苏联政府和人民对中国人民的社会主义建设事业的崇高的国际主义的关怀和援助。我借此机会向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。我深信，中苏两国的伟大同盟，对促进我们两国的共同繁荣和维护远东和世界和平，将更大地发挥着不可估量的作用。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年万岁！
    中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！
    我提议大家举杯为伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义和保卫世界和平事业中的辉煌胜利，为马林科夫同志的健康，为苏联政府和苏联共产党的领袖们的健康干杯！
