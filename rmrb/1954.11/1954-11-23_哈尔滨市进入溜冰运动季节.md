    Harbin Enters Ice Skating Season

    The city of Harbin has entered the ice skating season, and many units are building ice rinks, while ice sports enthusiasts are actively preparing their skates.

    The ice rinks at Harbin's Hongxing and Nangang Stadiums have already started construction, covering a total area of 18,140 square meters. This year, the city also plans to build two new ice rinks in Zhaolin Park and the Daowai residential area. A grandstand with a capacity of over 20,000 spectators and a large ice rink covering an area of over 19,000 square meters are under construction at the Harbin People's Stadium, where the Harbin city-wide ice skating competition will be held. Currently, more than 60 factories, enterprises, organizations, and schools in the city have prepared to build ice rinks.

    In order to meet the needs of the city's residents for winter ice sports, Songjiang Hardware Factory has completed the fourth quarter's ice skate production task in 42 days and plans to increase the production of ice skates by 4,500 pairs.

    The Harbin Municipal Sports Commission, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, in order to vigorously promote ice sports and winter physical exercise, have compiled a "Winter Sports Handbook" and decided to hold winter sports lectures.
