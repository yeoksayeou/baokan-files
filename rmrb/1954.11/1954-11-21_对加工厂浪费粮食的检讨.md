Reaction to Criticism and Suggestions

    Self-Criticism of Food Waste in Processing Plants
    Letter from Tangshan Municipal Grain Bureau: Comrade Chen Qingsheng's criticism of the excessive rice content in bran at our bureau's grain processing plant, which constitutes a waste of national wealth, is entirely correct. The reasons for this error are: Firstly, the leadership harbors a serious capitalist management ideology, focusing narrowly on petty profits and giving little consideration to policy matters. Consequently, when the business and processing sections discovered that the bran contained excessive broken rice and suggested sifting and processing it separately, the processing plant leadership dismissed the idea with excuses such as "processing is difficult" and "the labor cost is not worth it." The responsible department also failed to uphold principles, conduct research and experiments, and instead shirked responsibility.
    Secondly, there is a lack of sound systems. The grain processing plant lacks clearly defined specifications for grain processing, and for a long time, there have been no fixed standards for the indicators and handling of processing by-products, making it difficult to trace responsibility when problems arise.
    In 1953, the processing plant also experienced problems such as regrinding over 600,000 jin of millet, low rice yield, and the waste of over 200,000 jin of sorghum throughout the year. Although we wrote self-criticisms, proposed improvements, and made resolutions, we failed to diligently inspect and supervise, and the resolutions were not fully implemented. At times, we even accommodated the processing plant's shortcomings. For example, from January to July of this year, the rice yield was short by over 50,000 jin according to test samples, and after clearing the accounts, there was still a shortage of over 10,000 jin. However, we did not further investigate the reason for the shortage of rice to improve our work, but instead attempted to write it off.
    The quality of grain work directly affects the country's industrial construction and the people's livelihood. The lessons learned from this incident have made us further realize the significance of our work responsibilities. In the future, we will strengthen our sense of responsibility in our work, establish and improve various systems, clarify division of labor, and assign responsibility at each level to plug loopholes in our work.

### 对加工厂浪费粮食的检讨

    对加工厂浪费粮食的检讨
    唐山市粮食管理局来信：陈庆生同志对我局所属粮米加工厂糠中含米浪费国家财富的批评是完全正确的。产生这个错误的原因是：首先在于领导上有严重的资本主义经营思想，斤斤计较于小利，对政策问题很少考虑。因而当业务、加工两科发现糠含碎米过多，提出过筛后分别处理的意见，加工厂领导方面却用“加工有困难”“不够工钱”等话来搪塞时，主管科也没有坚持原则，进行研究试验，而是用不负责任的态度推出门去了事。
    其次，缺乏健全的制度。加工厂加工粮食的规格没有明确规定，长时期使加工副产品的指标和处理没有一定标准，发生了问题也不好追查责任。
    一九五三年加工厂也曾经发生过六十多万斤小米回碾和出米率低、全年浪费秫米二十多万斤等问题。虽然曾经写过检讨，提出过改进意见，作出过决议，但由于我们没有认真检查督促，决议也没有全面贯彻。有时对加工厂还有迁就思想。如本年一至七月份，按试样出米率亏米五万多斤，清底以后还差一万多斤，但我们并没有进一步追查短米的原因，以改进工作，而是企图设法下账了事。
    粮食工作的好坏，直接影响着国家的工业建设和人民的生活。通过这次事件的教训，使我们更进一步地认识到自己工作责任的重大。今后我们在工作中要加强责任感，要建立和健全各种制度，明确分工，逐级负责，以堵塞工作中的漏洞。
