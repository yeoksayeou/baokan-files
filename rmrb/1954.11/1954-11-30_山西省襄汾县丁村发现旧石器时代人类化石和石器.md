    Shanxi Province, Xiangfen County, Dingcun Discovers Paleolithic Human Fossils and Stone Tools
    From September 22nd to November 12th, the excavation team of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered three fossilized human teeth, more than two thousand stone tools, and over thirty boxes of fossils, including at least twenty-six species of vertebrates, in Dingcun, Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province. This discovery will make a significant contribution to the study of human origins and development, as well as the study of ancient Chinese culture.
    According to research conducted by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Dingcun fossil hominid belonged to primitive humans who lived in the lower reaches of the Fen River before the Loess Period and after the Nihewan Period. Its geological age is roughly the same as that of "Peking Man" discovered in Zhoukoudian near Beijing. After conversion by Yang Zhongjian, director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is believed that these are primitive humans from approximately 150,000 to 600,000 years ago. According to the preliminary observations of anthropologist Wu Rukang, the Dingcun fossil hominid is more advanced than "Peking Man."
    The stone tools used by these humans were made of a type of black igneous rock. According to the preliminary research of Pei Wenzhong, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the stone flake manufacturing method is simple and the forms are very primitive.
    Fossils of rhinoceroses, elephants, cattle, and horses were also discovered alongside these human fossils, indicating that the natural environment in the lower reaches of the Fen River at that time was suitable for human reproduction and habitation.
    The fossil excavation site was discovered by local workers while digging sand. All excavation work was carried out by an excavation team organized by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Currently, scientists are conducting further research on the Dingcun fossil hominid. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省襄汾县丁村发现旧石器时代人类化石和石器
    中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室的发掘队从九月二十二日到十一月十二日在山西省襄汾县丁村发现了三枚人类牙齿的化石和二千多件石器，以及三十多箱包括至少二十六种脊椎动物的化石。这一发现，对于研究人类的起源和发展以及研究中国古代文化将有重要贡献。
    据中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室的研究确定：这个丁村化石人，是属于黄土时期以前和泥河湾时期以后在汾河下流居住的原始人类。它的地质时代，和北京附近周口店所发现的“中国猿人”的时代大致相同。经过中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室主任杨锺健换算结果，认为这是大约十五万年到六十万年前的原始人类。据人类学家吴汝康的初步观察，丁村化石人比“中国猿人”较为进步。
    这种人使用的石器，用一种黑色的火成岩制成。据中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室研究员裴文中的初步研究，认为石片制作方法简单，形式很原始。
    和这种人类化石同时发现的还有犀牛、象、牛和马的化石，说明当时汾河下流的自然环境是适合于人类繁殖生息的。
    化石发掘地点是当地工人在挖砂子时发现的。全部发掘工作都是由中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室组成的发掘队来进行。现在，科学工作者们正对丁村化石人作进一步的研究。 （新华社）
