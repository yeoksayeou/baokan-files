The Second National Conference on Higher Agricultural and Forestry Education, which opened on October 27th, concluded on November 12th.

During the conference, Vice Premiers of the State Council Deng Zihui and Chen Yi, Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, Minister of Forestry Liang Xi, and Vice Minister Li Fanwu all delivered reports to the conference. At the close of the conference, Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng and Vice Ministers Zeng Zhaolun and Liu Aifeng respectively made concluding remarks on the guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural and forestry education, teaching reform and departmental adjustments, and the establishment of farms.

Through more than two weeks of study and discussion, the conference clarified that the guiding principles and tasks of higher agricultural and forestry education are: to follow the general task of the state during the transition period, to serve China's socialist transformation of agriculture and to improve agricultural and forestry productivity to promote the country's socialist industrialization; to cultivate comprehensively developed senior agricultural and forestry scientific and technical personnel and management personnel corresponding to the development of agricultural and forestry production. At the same time, it should assist agricultural and forestry scientific research institutions to solve some important problems in China's agricultural and forestry production process. According to the collectivization and mechanization process of China's agriculture and forestry, the specific tasks of higher agricultural colleges in the next eight to ten years are mainly to train agricultural scientific and technical personnel to serve district technical guidance stations, agricultural production cooperatives, special districts and county farms, and some personnel will work in state-owned farms and scientific research institutions; higher forestry colleges should focus on training scientific and technical personnel needed by state-owned forestry production enterprises. Therefore, in the next eight to ten years, the graduates of higher agricultural and forestry schools will mainly go to the masses to serve semi-socialist and socialist agricultural and forestry production cooperatives. Higher agricultural and forestry students should receive professional and technical education that combines local agricultural and forestry production practices on a broad foundation of scientific knowledge. The conference believes that systematically and comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union and correctly combining it with China's actual situation is the key to gradually improving the quality of teaching in higher agricultural and forestry colleges. The conference pointed out: It is necessary to continue to work hard to learn the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoints and methods, and to learn from the Soviet higher agricultural and forestry education system, content and teaching methods, while paying attention to the actual situation and existing problems of agricultural and forestry production in China today. The conference examined the shortcomings of higher agricultural and forestry education work in neglecting China's agricultural and forestry production experience, and believed that China's agricultural and forestry production has a long history and rich experience, but lacks systematic organization and has not been raised to the level of scientific theory. The correct attitude towards the experience of agricultural and forestry production in the motherland should be to oppose both national inferiority complex that ignores or denies it, and national arrogance that blindly believes that all the experience of agricultural and forestry production in the motherland is good. It is necessary to absorb its essence, discard its dross, and adopt a pragmatic scientific attitude. Good experiences that are beneficial to agricultural and forestry production in China should be summarized and researched in conjunction with scientific research, and carried forward, but outdated or anti-scientific ones should be criticized and abandoned. The conference called on higher agricultural and forestry education workers to first summarize the high-yield experience of today's peasant masses, especially agricultural labor models, and promote it in a timely manner; at the same time, begin to systematically and step-by-step organize the rich historical data of agricultural and forestry production in China.

The conference pointed out that the teachers of national universities, including higher agricultural and forestry colleges, have made great progress in political ideology in recent years, but academic criticism and discussion have not been carried out sufficiently, and the bourgeois ideology in academic thought has not been systematically criticized. The conference believes that carrying out academic criticism and discussion is an effective way to gradually eliminate bourgeois ideology, but it should not be carried out as a movement. It advocates equal and full free debate, opposes authoritative thinking, allows a few people to stick to their own opinions, and opposes subjective arbitrariness. For controversial issues, a pragmatic and truth-loving scientific attitude should be adopted to affirm the truth and abandon the errors, and a climate of academic criticism and free discussion should be established. Bourgeois academic culture should be criticized for its reactionary idealistic ideas, and its scientific technologies and materials that are useful to us should be critically absorbed.

Regarding the issue of higher agricultural and forestry colleges setting up farms, forest farms, and pastures, the conference believed that the basic tasks of school-run practice farms, forest farms, and pastures should be: to be the school's experimental research site; to serve students' teaching practice; and to complete certain production tasks and play a demonstration role in production. The management direction of school farms, in addition to small plots of land for experimental research, its large-scale production should focus on breeding and promoting fine varieties, and gradually implement comprehensive management combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, etc., according to needs and possibilities. The conference also studied the expansion plans for farms, forest farms, pastures, and fish farms of national higher agricultural and forestry colleges and the purchase of agricultural implements. The Ministry of Agriculture agreed, based on possible conditions, to allocate some small state-owned farms to schools for management, and to assist schools and state-owned farms to strengthen contact or sign contracts to meet the needs of teaching and production practice.

The conference also studied the development scale, departmental adjustments, professional settings, and teacher training of various schools in accordance with the national higher agricultural and forestry education's first five-year plan for training cadres. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国高等农林教育会议闭幕
    第二次全国高等农林教育会议在十月二十七日开幕、十一月十二日结束。
    会议进行期间，国务院副总理邓子恢、陈毅、农业部部长廖鲁言、林业部部长梁希、副部长李范五都到会作了报告。会议结束时，高等教育部部长杨秀峰、副部长曾昭抡、刘皑风分别就高等农林教育的方针任务、教学改革和院系调整、农场设置等问题作了总结。
    这次会议经过两个多星期的研究讨论，明确了高等农林教育的方针任务是：遵循着国家在过渡时期的总任务，为我国农业社会主义改造、提高农林业生产力以促进国家社会主义工业化而服务；为发展农林业生产而相应地培养全面发展的高级农林科学技术人材和管理人材。同时，应协助农林科学研究机关来解决我国农林业生产过程中某些重要问题。根据我国农林业集体化、机械化的进程，高等农业院校在今后十年八年内的具体任务，主要是培养区技术指导站、农业生产合作社、专区和县农场服务的农业科学技术人员，部分人将到国营农场和科学研究机关工作；高等林业学院则应以培养国有林业生产企业部门所需要的科学技术人材为主。因此，今后十年八年内高等农林学校的毕业生主要是到群众中去，为半社会主义和社会主义的农林生产合作社服务。高等农林学生应在宽广的科学知识基础上进行结合当地农林生产实际的专业技术教育。会议认为系统地全面地学习苏联正确结合中国实际是高等农林院校逐步提高教学质量的关键。会议指出：要继续努力学习马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，学习苏联高等农林教育制度、内容和教学方法，同时要注意今天中国农林业生产的实际情况和存在的问题。会议检查了高等农林教育工作忽视我国农林业生产经验的缺点，认为我国农林业生产历史悠久，经验丰富，但缺乏系统整理，没有提高到科学理论的水平。对待祖国农林生产经验的正确态度应是既要反对忽视或否定的民族自卑心理，也要防止盲目认为祖国农林生产经验都是好的的民族自傲情绪，必须吸取其精华，去其糟粕，采取实事求是的科学态度。对我国农林业生产有利的好的经验，应该结合科学研究工作总结研究，发扬光大，但对过时的或反科学的则应批判扬弃。会议要求高等农林教育工作者首先总结今天农民群众特别是农业劳动模范的丰产经验，及时推广；同时开始有计划有步骤地整理我国丰富的农林业生产的历史资料。
    会议指出，全国高等学校包括高等农林院校的教师几年来在政治思想上都有很大进步，但对学术批评讨论作得很不够，存在学术思想中的资产阶级思想未受到系统的批判。会议认为开展学术批评和讨论是逐步清除资产阶级思想的有效办法，但不应搞运动，提倡平等地充分地展开自由争论，反对权威思想，允许少数人坚持自己的意见，反对主观武断。对争论的问题，要采取实事求是热爱真理的科学态度，肯定真理，扬弃错误，要树立起学术批判和自由讨论的风气。对资产阶级学术文化应批判其反动的唯心思想，批判地吸收其对我们有用的科学技术和资料。
    关于高等农林院校设置农场、林场、牧场问题，会议认为学校设置实习农场、林场、牧场的基本任务：应是学校实验研究的场所；应为学生进行教学实习服务；应完成一定的生产任务并在生产上起示范作用。学校农场的经营方向，除小块土地供试验研究外，其大面积生产，应以繁育推广良种为主，并根据需要与可能，逐步实行农、林、牧等多样生产结合的综合性的经营。会议并研究了全国高等农林院校农场、林场、牧场、渔场的扩建和农具的添置计划等问题。农业部根据可能条件同意将一些小型国营农场划拨给学校办理，并协助学校和国营农场加强联系或订立合同，以便配合教学和生产实习的需要。
    这次会议还根据全国高等农林教育第一个五年培养干部的计划，研究了各校发展规模、院系调整、专业设置和培养师资等问题。（新华社）
