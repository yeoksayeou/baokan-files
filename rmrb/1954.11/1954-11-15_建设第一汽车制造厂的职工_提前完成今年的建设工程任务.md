Workers Building the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
Complete This Year's Construction Task Ahead of Schedule
[This newspaper's dispatch from the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Fourteenth] The workers building the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant victoriously completed this year's plant construction task on the fourteenth. Starting from the fifteenth, they will begin work on the 1955 tasks.

This year, the amount of work in the factory area of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant was very large, accounting for 45.5% of the entire factory area task, which is more than five times the amount of work completed in the factory area last year. Completing the task 47 days ahead of schedule is not only a victory for this year's plant construction work, but also of decisive significance for completing the entire project as scheduled.

The workers building the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant made great efforts to complete this year's construction tasks. Before September, the progress of the project was not very good. By the end of August, only 54% of the annual plan had been completed. The remaining 46% had to be completed in the four months after September. In order to complete this year's plant construction task, the leading authorities of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant took various emergency measures, the local Party committee provided various strong support, and Soviet experts provided many practical and feasible methods. On the leadership side, the first priority was to focus on plan management and work plans, and to make the completion of daily and ten-day progress plans the central task. The company manager held telephone dispatch meetings every day to solve problems in completing the plan in a timely manner, and went deep into the site to direct the construction site to check the implementation of the plan in a timely manner. Each work area also issued plans on time. Some work areas also made the ten-day work plan a system, and every ten days they had to summarize the completion of the plan and arrange the next ten-day plan. Therefore, the workers had a clear goal for completing the task.

While strengthening plan management, each work area implemented the foreman system, the regional management system, and promoted various advanced management systems such as engineering task lists, and established various administrative responsibility systems. Most units implemented a two-shift system, and key types of work implemented a three-shift system. At the same time, full use was made of mechanized and factory-based construction methods.

In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, labor competitions were carried out between work areas and work sections. In September, the number of people participating in the competition in the twelve units accounted for 65.87% of the total number of employees in the twelve units. The number of people participating in the labor competition in October increased nearly three times compared to June. The development of the labor competition greatly increased the enthusiasm of the workers and effectively promoted the progress of the project. The average labor efficiency in early November reached 125.4% of the quota. Bricklayers who often failed to meet the quota in the past now average 119.5%, and steelworkers average 132%. At the same time, construction was insisted on even in rainy weather.

In the process of completing the task ahead of schedule this year, the suggestions of Soviet experts played a significant role. From January to September of this year, experts put forward 1,953 suggestions and answers to questions, and also helped promote advanced working methods such as "inner scaffolding" and "large building blocks."

Now the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has entered a tense stage of winter construction. Their slogan is to do a good job in winter engineering and strive to over fulfill the construction tasks. In terms of leadership, they are working to summarize the construction experience of the whole year and formulate the 1955 construction organization technical measures plan, as well as preparations for winter training and education.

    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工
    提前完成今年的建设工程任务
    【本报第一汽车制造厂工地十四日电】十四日，建设第一汽车制造厂的职工，胜利地完成了今年的建厂任务。从十五日起他们就开始进行一九五五年的工作了。
    今年第一汽车制造厂的厂区工程量很大，占整个厂区任务的百分之四十五点五，相当于去年完成厂区工作量的五倍多。这次提前四十七天完成任务不仅是今年建厂工作的胜利，而且对如期完成整个工程都有决定性的意义。
    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工为完成今年施工任务作了很大的努力。在九月份以前，工程进度情况并不太好。到八月底，才完成全年计划的百分之五十四。剩下的百分之四十六要在九月以后的四个月当中来完成。为了完成今年的建厂任务，建设第一汽车制造厂的领导机关曾经采取了各种紧急措施，当地党委给予各种有力的支援，苏联专家提供了许多切实可行的方法。在领导机关方面，首先抓紧了计划管理和作业计划，并把完成日、旬进度计划作为中心。公司经理每天召开电话调度会议，及时解决完成计划当中的问题，并深入现场，指挥工地及时检查计划的执行情况。各工区也都按时下达计划。有的工区还把旬作业计划订为制度，每旬都要总结计划完成的情况，并布置下一旬计划。因此职工们有了完成任务的明确目标。
    在加强计划管理的同时，各工区实行了工长制、区域管理制，推行了工程任务单等各种先进管理制度，建立了各种行政责任制度，各单位大都实行了双班制，关键工种实行了三班制。同时充分利用机械化、工厂化的施工方法。
    为了提前完成任务，各工区、各工段之间开展了劳动竞赛。九月份，十二个单位参加竞赛的人数，占十二个单位职工总人数的百分之六十五点八七。十月份参加劳动竞赛的人数较六月份扩大了将近三倍。劳动竞赛的开展，大大提高了职工的积极性，有力地推动了工程进度。十一月上旬的劳动效率平均达到定额的百分之一百二十五点四。过去经常达不到定额的瓦工现在平均达到百分之一百一十九点五，钢筋工平均达到百分之一百三十二。同时坚持了雨天施工。
    在今年提前完成任务的过程中，苏联专家的建议具有重大的作用。今年一至九月份专家先后提出的建议和问题解答一千九百五十三件，还帮助推广了“里脚手”、“大型砌块”等先进工作方法。
    现在第一汽车制造厂工地已进入紧张的冬季施工的阶段。他们的口号是做好冬季工程，更多地争取超额完成施工任务。在领导方面，正着手总结全年施工经验和制订一九五五年施工组织技术措施计划，及冬季训练教育的准备工作。
