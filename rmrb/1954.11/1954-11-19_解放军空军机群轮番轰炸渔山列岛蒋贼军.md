Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 18th—A certain air unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force on the Zhejiang front repeatedly bombarded the Chiang Kai-shek troops' positions on the Yushan Islands on the morning of the 18th. Many bombs hit the Chiang Kai-shek troops' anti-aircraft machine gun positions on North Yushan Island, immediately silencing the Chiang Kai-shek troops' anti-aircraft machine guns. The Chiang Kai-shek troops' camp on North Yushan Island was also hit, causing thick smoke to rise.

When our People's Air Force fleets were repeatedly bombarding the Chiang Kai-shek troops' positions on the Yushan Islands, Chiang Kai-shek's planes flying over the northeast of Dachen Island dared not engage and hurriedly turned south to flee.

Our People's Air Force fleets safely returned to base after successfully completing their bombing mission.

The Yushan Islands are located in the sea about 100 li northeast of Dachen Island and are the northernmost island occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops along the Zhejiang coast. The island is garrisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops' "Yushan Area Headquarters" and more than 1,000 sea bandit guerrilla troops, who frequently rob fishermen and merchant ships in the Sanmen Bay and Xiangshan waters of Zhejiang, and carry out harassment and sabotage activities against our coastal areas. Since our People's Liberation Army successively liberated Toumenshan Island, Tian'ao Island, and Dongji Island southwest of the Yushan Islands in May of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Yushan Islands have become extremely isolated and panic-stricken.

    解放军空军机群轮番轰炸渔山列岛蒋贼军
    【新华社浙江前线十八日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军空军某机队在十八日上午轮番轰炸了盘踞在渔山列岛上的蒋贼军阵地，很多炸弹都命中了北渔山岛蒋贼军的高射机枪阵地，蒋贼军的高射机枪当即被炸得发射不出一发子弹来。北渔山岛上蒋贼军的营地也被炸中，冒起了浓烟。
    当我人民空军机队轮番轰炸渔山列岛上蒋贼军阵地时，正飞到大陈岛东北上空的蒋贼军飞机不敢迎战，慌忙调头向南逃去。
    我人民空军机队在胜利地完成轰炸任务后，全部安全返航。
    渔山列岛在大陈岛东北约一百华里的海上，是蒋贼军盘踞在浙江沿海最北的一个岛屿。岛上驻有蒋贼军“渔山地区司令部”和海匪游杂部队约一千多人，经常在我浙江三门湾和象山海面上抢劫渔民、商船，并向我沿海地区进行骚扰、破坏活动。自今年五月间我人民解放军连续解放了渔山列岛西南的头门山岛、田岙岛和东矶山岛等后，渔山列岛上的蒋贼军极为孤立和恐慌。
