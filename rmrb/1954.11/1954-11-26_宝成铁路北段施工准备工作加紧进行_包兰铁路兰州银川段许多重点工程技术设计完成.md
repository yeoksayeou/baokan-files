    Preparatory Work for the Northern Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is Speeding Up
    Technical Design of Many Key Projects on the Lanzhou-Yinchuan Section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Completed
    The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will begin full-scale construction next spring, and various preparatory tasks are being expedited.
    Freight trains coming from the east along the Longhai Railway are continuously transporting a large number of mechanized construction machines to Baoji, some of which have already been delivered to the site. Various work areas scattered in the deep valleys of the Qinling Mountains are rushing to build temporary houses and sheds. The construction of a transportation network of dozens of kilometers connecting the various work areas has also begun. Automobile roads, tractor roads, and donkey-horse trails have been partially built. The overhead cableway for transporting materials in the high mountainous areas is being designed urgently. A small thermal power plant officially started supplying electricity in mid-November, and this power plant will be expanded in the future. In addition, ancillary enterprises such as communication lines, lumber processing plants, machinery repair plants, brick and lime kilns, and employee living supplies stations have been either completed or are under preparation.
    The labor force required for next year's construction is being actively organized and deployed. More than 20,000 migrant workers had already gone to various work areas by mid-November. Currently, in addition to the personnel from the Sixth Engineering Bureau, the Fourth Engineering Bureau, and the Tunnel Company of the Ministry of Railways being mostly assembled, a large team that participated in the Wushaoling Tunnel project on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been transferred to Baoji and will soon be heading to the construction site.
    1955 will be the most intense year for the construction of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, with approximately half of the total workload to be completed in this year. Moreover, these projects will be carried out in mountainous areas with complex terrain, requiring a great deal of earth and stone excavation and long tunnel boring. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The technical designs for many key projects on the Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway have been completed and will be started successively. Currently, the completed technical designs include 5.4 kilometers to 5.9 kilometers of earthwork and stonework for the roadbed, culvert projects, and key projects such as the external earthwork and stonework and drainage projects for the large tunnels in Qing Shi Wan, Lang She Tou, and Xing Xing Wan.
    After crossing the Yellow River north of Lanzhou, the Lanzhou-Yinchuan section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway enters a mountainous region with extremely complex terrain. In order to complete the detailed surveys and technical designs as soon as possible, the surveying and design personnel of the Third Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways learned the advanced experience of the Soviet "cross-section alignment method" and created methods such as "oblique distance training" and "altitude calculation disk" in the technical innovation campaign, overcoming many difficulties in high mountains and deep valleys, which greatly improved the quality of the detailed survey of this section. For example, the initial survey for earthwork and stonework averaged 200,000 cubic meters per kilometer, but now, including the earthwork and stonework for the station yards, the average is approximately 180,000 cubic meters, a reduction of approximately 20,000 cubic meters per kilometer. The initial survey identified twenty-six tunnels, with a total length of 5,530 meters. Due to new requirements for the seismic zone design and improvements in the slope, the detailed survey changed this to fifteen tunnels, with a total length of 3,900 meters, a reduction of 1,630 meters compared to the initial survey, which will greatly reduce national investment. The preliminary design of this line and the section from Jiaojiawan to Shili Mountain on the Tian-Lan Railway was initially to proceed in parallel. However, after Soviet line experts conducted in-depth on-site investigations, they suggested using a grade separation line to elevate it, which would reduce two tunnels and also reduce the realignment of the Tian-Lan Railway.

    宝成铁路北段施工准备工作加紧进行
    包兰铁路兰州银川段许多重点工程技术设计完成
    宝成铁路北段明年春天就要全面动工，各种施工准备工作正在加紧进行。
    从陇海铁路东面开来的货物列车，正陆续把机械化施工用的大批机械运到宝鸡，有的已运到现场。分布在秦岭山脉重山深谷间的各工区，正赶着盖临时房屋和工棚。联络各工区的几十公里运输网道，也已着手筹建。汽车便道、拖拉机道、驴马道已部分施工，为高崖山地运输用的高架索道，正在赶紧设计。一座小型火力发电厂已在十一月中旬正式送电，这座电厂将来还要扩大。此外，通讯线路、木材加工厂、机械修配厂、砖瓦石灰窑、职工生活品供应站等附属企业，有的已建成，有的也在筹设。
    明年施工所需要劳动力，正在积极组织调配。十一月中旬已有二万多民工前往各工区。现在除了铁道部第六工程局、第四工程局和隧道公司的人员大部调齐外，一个参加过兰新铁路乌鞘岭隧道工程的大队，已调到宝鸡，不久就要开到工地。
    一九五五年是宝成铁路北段施工最紧张的一年，约有占全段工作总量一半的工作量要在这一年做完。而且，这些工程都要在地形复杂的山岳地带进行，要填挖很多土石方，凿很长的隧道。　（新华社）
    包兰铁路兰州银川段许多重点工程已做好技术设计，并将陆续开工。目前已经完成技术设计的有五点四公里到五点九公里的路基土石方、泄水洞工程，和青石湾、狼舌头、猩猩湾等处的大隧道洞外土石方、排水工程等重点工程。
    包兰铁路兰银段由兰州北去跨过黄河后，即进入山岳地区，地形极其复杂。铁道部西北设计分局第三勘测设计总队的勘测人员，为了早日完成定测和技术设计，学习了苏联“横断面选线法”的先进经验，并在技术革新运动中创造“斜距拉练”、
  “高度计算盘”等方法，克服了许多高山深谷的困难，使这段线路的定测质量有很大提高。如土石方工程初测时每公里平均为二十万方，现在连站场土石方在内平均约十八万方，每公里减少了两万方左右；隧道工程初测时是二十六座，共延长五千五百三十公尺，由于地震区的设计又有了新的要求和边坡的改善，定测后改成了十五座，共延长三千九百公尺，比初测时缩短了一千六百三十公尺，将使国家投资量大大减少。这段线路和天兰铁路的焦家湾到十里山初步设计是平行前进，后经苏联线路专家深入现场了解，建议用立体交叉线路提高，这样就可减少两座隧道，并可减少天兰铁路的改线。
