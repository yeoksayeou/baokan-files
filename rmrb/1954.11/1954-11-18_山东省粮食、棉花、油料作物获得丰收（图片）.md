Shandong Province has achieved bumper harvests of several major crops this year. According to preliminary statistics, the total output of autumn grain has increased by 3,243 million catties compared to last year; cotton has increased by over 80 million catties (lint cotton); and peanuts have increased by over 760 million catties compared to last year.

    山东省粮食、棉花、油料作物获得丰收
    山东省今年几种主要农作物都获得丰收。据初步统计，秋粮总产量比去年增加三十二亿四千三百万斤；棉花比去年增加八千多万斤（皮棉）；花生比去年增加七亿六千多万斤。现在，广大农民正踊跃地把粮食、棉花和油料卖给国家，支援国家建设。山东省临沂县大岭村红星第一农业生产合作社的玉米今年获得丰收，每亩平均产量四百斤。这是社里丰收的玉米。大众日报稿　孙保朴摄
