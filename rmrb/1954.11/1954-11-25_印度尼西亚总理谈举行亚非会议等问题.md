Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 24th: Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo delivered a radio address on Radio Republik Indonesia on the 22nd. He said that Indonesia's proposed Asian-African Conference plan has been warmly welcomed by many Asian and African countries and has attracted great attention from Western and Eastern countries.

The Indonesian Prime Minister said that because the whole world is still living in an atmosphere of tension, the language and spirit of peace that will appear at the Asian-African Conference will inevitably attract the attention of the whole world.

The Indonesian Prime Minister said that the five prime ministers of the Colombo Conference countries will meet again informally in Bogor, Indonesia, on December 28 to discuss issues related to holding the Asian-African Conference. He said: For the first time in our history, four prime ministers of neighboring friendly countries will come to Indonesia to discuss constructive efforts on international affairs with the Prime Minister of this Republic, and we hope that this will make a valuable contribution to world peace.

Sastroamidjojo said that the recovery of West Irian is a unanimous demand of the entire nation. This is a common aspiration of the government and the opposition parties. He said that any move to weaken the government would inevitably weaken the government's diplomatic struggle in the United Nations to recover West Irian.

Sastroamidjojo said that the cabinet has overcome the difficult situation it faced in the reorganization. He said that the cabinet continues to exercise its functions and steadfastly implements the political program passed by the parliament.

He emphasized that Indonesia will, as in the past, continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. The purpose of this policy is to consolidate friendship and peace among nations. This policy has the full support of the Indonesian people.

The Indonesian Prime Minister said that the government has decided to complete the work of the general election. He asked the people to support the government in the general election. He said that this general election will bring a peaceful and orderly political life to the country.

    印度尼西亚总理谈举行亚非会议等问题
    【新华社雅加达二十四日电】印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约二十二日在印度尼西亚共和国电台发表广播演说。他说，印度尼西亚所发起的亚非会议的计划受到了许多亚洲和非洲国家的热烈欢迎，并且引起了西方和东方国家很大的注意。
    印度尼西亚总理说，由于整个世界还生活在紧张的空气中，因此，将要在亚非会议出现的和平的语言和精神，必然会引起全世界的注意。
    印度尼西亚总理说，科伦坡会议国家的五位总理将在十二月二十八日再次在印度尼西亚茂物举行非正式的会议，讨论关于举行亚非会议的问题。他说：在我们的历史上将第一次有四位邻近的友好国家的总理来到印度尼西亚同这个共和国的总理商谈有关国际事务的建设性努力问题，我们希望这将对世界和平作出有价值的贡献。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，收回西伊里安是全国一致的要求。这是政府和反对党的共同愿望。他说，任何削弱政府的举动也必然会削弱政府在联合国的争取收回西伊里安的外交斗争。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，内阁已经在改组中克服了它所面对的困难局面。他说，内阁继续行使职权，并且坚定地执行国会所通过的政纲。
