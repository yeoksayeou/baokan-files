Suining Prefecture Intensively Sowing Spring Crops

The sowing of spring crops in Suining Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has entered a critical phase. In general areas, the sown area has reached over 50%, while in Yanting County, the sowing of rapeseed and wheat is nearing completion.

During the autumn sowing, farmers in various areas are producing according to the national plan. The planting area for rapeseed has increased by 8% across the prefecture, and the planting area for improved varieties of "Japanese rapeseed" and wheat "Zhongda 2419" has increased by 520,000 mu compared to last year. For example, in Chengdun, Nanqiang, and Beigu townships of Suining County, 1,715 mu of rapeseed have been planted this year, an increase of 45% compared to last year. Among the 550 mu of rapeseed sown in Nanqiang Township, 88% are the improved variety "Japanese rapeseed". Of the wheat already sown in Yanting County, the improved variety "Zhongda 2419" accounts for 30%.

Currently, in the river valley fields and on the hillside slopes, groups of people are preparing the land and sowing seeds everywhere. The tractor team of the prefectural farm is helping the sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in Hedong Township, Suining County, to plow the land day and night, and the cooperative members are actively sowing seeds. The mutual aid teams of the first village of Huilong Township in Zhongjiang County have adopted the method of assigning individual responsibility to help twenty-eight farming households without labor to sow wheat and rapeseed in a timely manner.

    遂宁专区紧张播种小春作物
    四川省遂宁专区小春作物播种已进入紧张阶段，一般地区播种面积已达百分之五十以上，盐亭县油菜、小麦播种已近结束。
    秋种中，各地农民都根据国家计划进行生产，全区油菜种植面积扩大百分之八，“日本油菜”和小麦“中大二四一九”良种种植面积比去年增加五十二万亩。如遂宁县城敦、南强、北固三个乡今年种油菜一千七百一十五亩，比去年增加百分之四十五。南强乡播种的五百五十亩油菜中，百分之八十八是“日本油菜”良种。盐亭县已种下的小麦，“中大二四一九”良种即占百分之三十。
    目前，在河坝地里，山坡土上，到处都是整地播种的人群。专区农场的拖拉机队，日夜不停地帮助遂宁县河东乡的十六个农业生产合作社翻犁土地，社员们正在积极播种。中江县会龙乡第一村的互助组采取分别包干负责的办法，帮助二十八户无劳动力的农户及时种下了小麦和油菜。
