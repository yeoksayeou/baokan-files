    Building Our Petroleum Base
    Jiao Lire, Deputy Director of Yumen Mining Bureau
    In the past few years, the face of the Yumen Oilfield has been changing with each passing day, and the magnificent outline of the motherland's first petroleum base is becoming increasingly clear before our eyes. We, all the petroleum workers participating in the construction of the Yumen Oilfield, whenever we are happy for the construction achievements of the mining area, are reminded of the sincere assistance given to us by the great Soviet Union.
    In order to help us build the first petroleum base, the Soviet government not only supplied us with a large amount of urgently needed petroleum equipment, but also sent outstanding experts to guide our work. As early as the winter of 1949, Soviet experts braved the bitter cold to come to the desolate Gobi Desert. Over the past five years, they have given us tremendous help, and their high degree of internationalist spirit and superb skills have left an indelible impression on our Chinese petroleum workers.
    For more than ten years in the past, under the management of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Yumen Oilfield also had so-called American "experts" to "help" with the work, but even the drive type of the oilfield here (that is, what force drives the oil to gush out from the bottom of the well) was not clarified. At that time, there was no complete development plan and scientific mining methods at all. They drilled wells and extracted oil indiscriminately, which damaged the oilfield, stopped the oil wells from gushing, and countless amounts of oil, like pearls, were buried underground for a long time.
    In October 1953, the Soviet design team led by Comrade Trafimuk, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, came to the mine to help us formulate an oilfield development plan and solve this most fundamental problem. What kind of oilfield is the Yumen Oilfield after all? Most of our technicians believed that it was gas-driven, and some occasionally mentioned that it was a water-driven oilfield. But no one had sufficient evidence, and no one dared to draw a conclusion.
    After Comrade Trafimuk arrived, he used great courage and enthusiasm to draw a conclusion on the nature of the oilfield. He talked with engineers and workers, conducted investigations in all aspects, and personally studied the topography and oil well conditions of the mining area. After discovering the existence of natural water around the oilfield, he judged that the past oil wells could gush out, on the one hand, by water drive, and on the other hand, by natural gas dissolved in the oil. The vague argument of "either water or gas" was refuted. However, the question of which is more, gas or water, which is the main one, arose again. Comrade Trafimuk further studied the data. He used his extensive theory and rich experience to conduct careful analysis and research, and finally affirmed the water-drive-based oilfield nature. In this way, for the first time in the history of the Yumen Oilfield, the development plan of relying on the power of water to squeeze oil from the ground was affirmed.
    The driving force of natural water is limited, and water injection projects must be built to strengthen the driving effect of underground water. The construction of water injection projects is a very complex task. During World War II, this superb technology was born in the Soviet Union. Comrade Trafimuk, etc., specifically helped us determine the well location arrangement of the water injection wells, initially determined the interface between underground oil and water, and formulated a complete development plan. Hydrological experts Diachkov and Koskin also gave us systematic assistance in the design and construction of water source exploration and ground water injection projects.
    The role of water injection projects is very huge. It is the most economical and scientific method for developing oilfields. It can greatly reduce the construction of production wells and save a lot of national investment; injecting one more drop of water can extract one more drop of oil, and injecting a large amount of water can extract a large amount of oil. After the completion of the water injection project, the daily output of crude oil can be increased by four to five times, the self-spraying life of oil wells can be prolonged, and the final recovery rate can be increased by more than two times, so that the country's resources can be fully exploited. Now, under the guidance and help of Soviet experts, we are confidently carrying out the huge and technically complex water injection project composed of water sources, ground works, and water injection well drilling. We know that the construction of the water injection project will fundamentally change the production face of the Yumen Oilfield, and it is gradually laying a solid technical foundation for us to build the motherland's first petroleum base.
    The help given to us by Soviet experts is multifaceted.
    Thanks to the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts Moseev and Weigelin, all the drilling workers of the Yumen Oilfield have mastered the advanced technology of winter drilling, achieved year-round drilling, and doubled the efficiency of drilling rigs. This is equivalent to doubling the drilling speed. We know that the speed of drilling is one of the determining factors of the development speed of the petroleum industry. Therefore, the mastery of this advanced technology will undoubtedly accelerate the construction speed of the Yumen Oilfield. Now, some of our drilling workers have mastered the experience of drilling 2,800-meter deep wells, which is a major leap in drilling technology. The heavy pressure, fast rotation, and large pump volume rapid drilling method introduced to us by Soviet experts has opened up a broad road for improving our drilling technology. Model drilling teams such as Wang Dengxue and Tian Wenkuan have used these advanced methods to create new national drilling records six times, increasing the daily footage of drilling rigs from 150 meters to 234.3 meters, and the monthly footage of drilling rigs from 500 meters to 1,293 meters. All of this was unimaginable in the past.
    In oil production, Comrade Moseev, etc., helped us establish an organizational structure for zonal well-specific management of oil wells, a professional oil well repair organization, and a set of scientific well-specific quota and well-specific record management methods. The help of Soviet experts in well repair technology is a major revolution in our oil production technology. Now, we can not only initially achieve the normal production of oil wells, but also revive eleven abandoned oil wells that failed to produce oil or got stuck during drilling in the past, so that all oil wells can be put into production, and oil production is gradually becoming standardized.
    Soviet experts often tell us that the primary task of a factory is to complete the national plan, and the production plan is a concentrated expression of the Party and the state's policies. Once, Comrade Moseev found that when we were repairing a certain well, the plan was delayed due to an underestimated pressure leading to a blowout. He was very anxious and stayed on the well site day and night to guide our work. When we finally overcame the difficulties and repaired the well, and increased the well's output to fourteen times, how excited and happy he was! This is how Soviet comrades work with us, sharing hardships and joys. Comrade Moseev also often tells technicians to accurately grasp the oil well situation and conduct in-depth and detailed analysis and research. When he explains problems to workers, no matter how profound the technical theory is, he will do his best to explain it in simple and easy-to-understand terms. Once, when he explained to the oil workers how to use nozzles (devices on the oil pipe mouth to control the oil output and oil-gas ratio) and wax removal to control the oil-gas ratio and oil-gas relationship, he drew figurative pictures and used very simple analogies to explain the principles in an easy-to-understand way.
    In the past few years, in hundreds of thousands of contacts with Soviet experts, we have deeply felt the sincere desire of the Soviet people to help the Chinese people every time. They sincerely hope that our construction talents will grow up as soon as possible, our production plans can be completed ahead of schedule, our industrialization can be realized as soon as possible, and our socialist society can be built as soon as possible.
    We, all the petroleum workers building the Yumen Oilfield, will definitely not live up to this great and sincere friendship.

    建设我们的石油基地
    玉门矿务局副局长　焦力人
    几年来，玉门油矿的面貌日新月异地变化着，祖国第一个石油基地的壮丽轮廓已经愈来愈清晰地出现在我们的眼前了。我们，参加玉门油矿建设的全体石油工作者，每当为矿区的建设成就而高兴时，就联想到伟大的苏联所给予我们真诚的援助。
    为了帮助我们建设第一个石油基地，苏联政府不仅供应了我们大批迫切需要的石油器材，而且派遣了优秀的专家来指导我们工作。还在一九四九年冬季，苏联专家就冒着奇寒来到了荒僻的戈壁滩上。五年来，他们给予了我们以巨大的帮助，他们的高度的国际主义精神和精湛的技能，给我们中国的石油工作者留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    玉门油矿过去十多年在国民党反动派的经营下，虽然也有所谓美国“专家”来“帮助”过工作，但是连这里油田的驱动类型（即石油靠什么力量推动从井底自喷出来），都没弄清楚。当时，根本谈不到完整的开发方案和科学的开采方法，他们乱打井、乱采油，使油田遭到破坏，油井停止自喷，像珍珠般的无数量的油就长久埋在地下了。
    一九五三年十月，苏联科学院通讯院士特拉费姆克同志领导的苏联设计组来到矿上，帮助我们制订了油田开发方案，解决了这个最基本性质的问题。究竟玉门油矿的油田是什么性质的油田呢？我国的技术人员多半认为是气驱，也有人偶尔谈到过是水驱油田。但是谁也没有充分的根据，谁也不敢下结论。
    特拉费姆克同志来到以后，就用极大的魄力和热情，要给油田的性质作出结论。他同工程师和工人谈话，从各方面进行调查，并且亲自研究了矿区的地形和油井情况。他在发现油田周围有天然水存在后，对照资料判断过去的油井能够自喷，一方面靠水驱动，一方面靠溶解在油内的天然气驱动。那种“非水即气”，或者“非气即水”的模糊论调就被驳倒了。可是，究竟气多、水多，何者为主的问题又发生了。特拉费姆克同志进一步研究了资料。他用自己渊博的理论和丰富的经验，作了精心的分析研究，最后肯定了以水驱为主的油田性质。这样，玉门油矿有史以来第一次肯定了依靠水的力量把油从地下挤出来的开发方案。
    天然水的驱动力量是有限的，还要建造注水工程，才能加强地下水的驱动作用。建造注水工程是十分复杂的工作，第二次世界大战中，这种高超的技术才在苏联诞生。特拉费姆克同志等具体帮助我们确定了注水井的井位排列，初步确定了地下油和水的交接线，制定了完整的开发方案。水文专家季亚赤阔夫和柯斯金同志，又在水源探勘和地面注水工程的设计和施工方面，给了我们系统的帮助。
    注水工程的作用是很巨大的。它是最经济、最科学的开发油田的方法。它能大大地减少生产井的建设，大量节约国家投资；多注一滴水就能多采一滴油，大量注水就能大量采油。注水工程完成后，能够使原油日产量提高四倍到五倍，能够使油井自喷年限延长，能够使最终采收率提高二倍以上，这样就能使国家资源充分地被开采出来。现在，我们在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，正满怀信心地进行着由水源、地面工程一直到注水井钻凿所组成规模巨大的、技术复杂的注水工程。我们知道：注水工程的建设，将会使玉门油矿的生产面貌发生根本性质的变化，它正在逐渐为我们建设祖国第一个石油基地打下雄厚的技术基础。
    苏联专家给我们的帮助是多方面的。
    由于苏联专家莫谢耶夫和魏盖林同志的热心帮助，玉门油矿的全体钻井工人掌握了冬季钻井的先进技术，作到了常年钻井，使钻机使用时效提高一倍。这就等于钻井速度加快了一倍。我们知道，钻井速度的快慢是石油事业发展速度的决定因素之一。因此，这项先进技术的掌握，无疑地会加快玉门油矿的建设速度。现在，我们一部分钻井工人已经掌握了钻凿二千八百公尺深井的经验，这在钻井技术上是一大跃进。苏联专家介绍给我们的重压、快转、大泵量的快速钻进方法，为提高我们的钻井技术开辟了宽阔的道路。王登学、田文宽等模范钻井队运用这些先进方法，先后六次创造全国钻井新纪录，钻机日进尺由一五○公尺提高到二三四·三公尺，钻机月进尺由五○○公尺提高到一二九三公尺。所有这些在过去都是不可想像的。
    在采油工作上，莫谢耶夫同志等，帮助我们建立了分区专井专人管理油井的组织机构、油井专业修理机构和一套科学分井定额、分井纪录的管理方法。苏联专家在修井技术上对我们的帮助，是我们采油技术中的重大革命。现在，我们不仅能够初步作到油井的正常生产，而且还复活了过去由于不出油、钻井时卡钻等报废的油井十一口，使所有的油井都能进行生产，采油工作逐步走向正规化。
    苏联专家经常告诉我们：工厂的首要任务是完成国家计划，生产计划是党和国家政策的集中表现。有一次，莫谢耶夫同志发现我们修某号井时，因为压力估计错误引起井喷，延误了修井计划，他非常着急，日夜守在井场上指导我们工作。当我们最后克服困难修好了这口井，并使井产量提高到十四倍时，他又是多么的兴奋和愉快啊！苏联同志就是这样和我们共艰苦共欢乐地工作着。莫谢耶夫同志还经常告诉技术人员要确切掌握油井情况，深入细致地进行分析研究。他给工人讲问题时，不管怎样高深的技术理论，都要用尽一切努力讲得通俗易懂。有一次，他给采油工人们讲解用油嘴（油管口上控制出油量和油气比的装置）和清腊控制油气比和油气关系时，画了形象图，并用非常通俗的譬喻，深入浅出地说明了其中的道理。
    几年来，我们在和苏联专家千百次的接触中，每一次都深切地感觉到苏联人民帮助中国人民的真诚愿望。他们真诚地愿望：我们的建设人才早日成长起来，我们的生产计划能够提前完成，我们的工业化早日实现，我们的社会主义社会早日建成。
    我们建设玉门油矿的全体石油工作者，一定不会辜负这种伟大的、真诚的友谊。
