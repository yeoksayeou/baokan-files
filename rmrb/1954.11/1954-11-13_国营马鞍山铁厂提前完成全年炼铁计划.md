    State-Owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Completes Annual Iron Smelting Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The State-Owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant completed its annual iron smelting plan fifty-six days ahead of schedule. The qualified rate of pig iron quality exceeded the state plan by 0.168 percent, the labor productivity of workers increased significantly compared to the plan, the cost per ton of pig iron was reduced by nearly half compared to the early stage of furnace operation last year, and the financial plan was also completed. Currently, all employees of the plant are continuing their efforts to overfulfill the annual target of increasing production and practicing economy by 33 billion yuan.
    This year, the employees of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, following the suggestions of Soviet experts, improved technical operation methods and promoted advanced Soviet iron smelting experiences such as "furnace top adjustment" and "ore grading and classification into the furnace." As a result, the equipment utilization rate of the iron smelting furnaces was improved, and the average effective volume required for each ton of iron smelted by the six iron smelting furnaces was reduced to 0.8942 cubic meters. Among them, the No. 6 iron smelting furnace even reduced it to 0.619 cubic meters, creating a new national record for daily pig iron production in small iron smelting furnaces.
    After June this year, the employees of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant fought against the worst flood in nearly a century for more than 100 days. Some employees and farmers jointly guarded the Yangtze River embankment, while the remaining employees persisted in production under the slogan of "one person completing the tasks of several people," and overfulfilled the production plans for July and August. After winning the flood control battle, the workers launched a labor competition to increase production and practice economy, which powerfully promoted production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国营马鞍山铁厂提前完成全年炼铁计划
    国营马鞍山铁厂提前五十六天完成全年炼铁计划。生铁质量的合格率超过国家计划百分之零点一六八，工人的劳动生产率比计划有显著提高，每吨生铁的成本费用比去年开炉初期降低将近一半，财务计划也完成了。现在，全厂职工正为超额完成全年增产节约三百三十亿元的目标而继续努力。
    马鞍山铁厂职工今年按照苏联专家建议改进了技术操作方法，推行了“炉顶调剂”和“矿石分级分类入炉”等苏联先进炼铁经验，因此，炼铁炉的设备利用率提高了，六座炼铁炉平均每炼一吨铁所需的有效容积降低到了零点八九四二立方公尺，其中六号炼铁炉并曾降低到零点六一九立方公尺，创造了全国小型炼铁炉日产生铁的新纪录。
    马鞍山铁厂职工在今年六月份以后，曾和近百年来特大洪水斗争了一百多天，一部分职工和农民一起坚守着长江大堤，其余的职工在“一人完成数人任务”的口号下坚持生产，而且超额完成了七八月份的生产计划。工人们在取得防汛斗争的胜利后，便展开了增产节约劳动竞赛，有力地推进了生产。　（新华社）
