Jilin Province Farmers Love Mongolian Horses

    The Jilin Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased more than 2,500 horses from the Mongolian People's Republic, and they have been distributed to nine counties. The first batch of Mongolian horses that arrived are currently pulling new-style farm tools for autumn plowing.

    Farmers greatly love the Mongolian horses, praising them for having "five greats and three goods": great frame, great hooves and legs, great grass opening (esophagus), great eyes, and great chest; good temperament, good at work, and good mouth. Farmers in various counties are vying to buy these draft horses. Some counties in the province used to lack horses. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, more and more people are requesting the use of new-style farm tools. However, cattle and donkeys are inconvenient for pulling new-style farm tools. After the Hongxing Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huai'de County bought new-style farm tools, these new-style farm tools went unused last year because the old cattle and donkeys tripped each other and lacked uniform strength. This year, they purchased five Mongolian horses, solving the difficulty of using new-style farm tools. The Tongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative is harvesting potatoes. In the past, it required three head of cattle plus one donkey. Now, two Mongolian horses can pull it, and they are quick and efficient. The work efficiency is doubled compared to using cattle. Farmers in counties such as Jiaohe and Dunhua who have purchased Mongolian horses are using them to transport grain to the state for sale. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    吉林省农民喜爱蒙古马
    吉林省供销合作社从蒙古人民共和国购进的两千五百多匹马，已先后发到九个县。目前第一批运到的蒙古马正拉着新式农具进行秋耕。
    农民十分喜爱蒙古马，称赞它们有五大三好：骨架大、蹄腿大、草口（食道）大、眼大、前裆大；性格好、干活好、口好。各县农民争购这批耕马。省内有些县份过去缺马，随着互助合作运动的发展，要求使用新式农具者日多，但牛和毛驴拉新式农具很不方便。怀德县红星第三农业生产合作社买到新式农具后，因为老牛和毛驴在一起绊腿、劲头不均，这些新式农具，去年放了一年未使用，今年购进了五匹蒙古马，解决了使用新式农具的困难。同兴农业生产合作社起马铃薯，过去需用三头牛外加一头毛驴，现在用两匹蒙古马便可以拉动，并且行动迅速，工作效率也比用牛提高了一倍。蛟河、敦化等县买到蒙古马的农民，正使用蒙古马驾辕套车运粮食向国家出售。　（据新华社讯）
