Northwest Native Produce Export Company Acquires Wild Hemp

    A large quantity of wild hemp grows in the Hexi area of Gansu Province, the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, and parts of the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River and Kongque River in southern Xinjiang Province in the Northwest region. This wild hemp has high economic value and can be exported. Last year, the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company purchased 1,000 catties of wild hemp in Xinjiang, sent it to the East China textile department for bleaching and trial production, and determined that the average fiber length of the product was more than 2.7 inches, twice as long as cotton fiber. Its fineness is equivalent to 58-count fine wool. It is snow-white and glossy in color and more flexible than ramie. Its tensile strength is stronger than wool and cotton. When blended with silk, wool, and cotton, it can be used to weave high-grade clothing materials such as "Venetian" and other types of broadcloth.

    In order to understand the production and use of wild hemp, in late July this year, the Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company sent cadres to cooperate with the trade company and other relevant departments to conduct a key survey in the producing area of Gansu Province. The trade companies of Xinjiang and Qinghai provinces also conducted preliminary investigations. The investigation found that, except for farmers in some areas of Xinjiang Province who used a small amount of wild hemp to twist ropes, weave sacks, and make fishing nets, the majority of areas in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang only cut wild hemp for firewood. A large number of useful resources are still being discarded and wasted.

    The Northwest Branch of the China Native Produce Export Company has now signed contracts with the Xinjiang Provincial Cooperative for the supply and export of 500 tons of wild hemp and with the Gansu Provincial Trade Company for the export of 300 tons of wild hemp. Currently, they are actively carrying out procurement and organizing exports. (Jia Sixian)

    西北土产出口公司收购野麻
    西北地区甘肃省河西一带、青海省柴达木盆地、新疆省南疆塔里木河及孔雀河中下游的一部分地区都生长大量野麻。这种野麻有很高的经济价值，而且可以出口。中国土产出口公司西北分公司去年在新疆采购野麻一千斤，送经华东纺织部门漂炼试制，判定该产品纤维平均长度在二寸七分以上，比棉花纤维长一倍，细度相当于五十八支细羊毛，色泽雪白光亮，质地柔韧胜过苎麻，拉力强于羊毛和棉花，同丝、羊毛、棉花合纺，可织制“凡立丁”等哔叽一类的高等衣料。
    为了了解野麻生产、使用等情况，今年七月下旬，中国土产出口公司西北分公司派干部配合贸易公司等有关部门，在甘肃省产地作了一次重点调查；新疆、青海两省的贸易公司也分别进行了初步的调查。经调查发现，除新疆省部分地区的农民采用少量野麻捻麻绳、织麻袋、制渔网外，甘肃、青海及新疆大部地区都只把野麻砍作柴烧，大批有用资源仍被废弃和浪费。
    中国土产出口公司西北分公司现在已经分别同新疆省合作社签订了五百吨野麻的供应出口合同，同甘肃省贸易公司签订了三百吨野麻的出口合同。目前，它们正在积极进行收购和组织出口。（贾思贤）
