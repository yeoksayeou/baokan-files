Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing -- Southwest Steel Company's affiliated factories and mines, in the process of compiling the 1955 production and financial plan, paid attention to fully exploring the potential capabilities of the enterprises from aspects such as rationally adjusting existing equipment, improving operating techniques, and improving labor organization. The 101 Steel Plant has a large rolling capacity, but because the current output of steel ingots and the heating capacity of the ingots in the plant cannot meet the needs of rolling steel, the rolling capacity cannot be fully utilized. This time, when compiling the plan, the 101 Steel Plant decided to lengthen the existing ingot heating furnace to increase the heating capacity of the ingots, and decided to further improve the equipment and operation methods of the original open hearth furnace and the newly built large open hearth furnace to increase the output of steel. In order to make full use of the rolling equipment capacity, the 102 Steel Plant has researched a method to rationally adjust the labor organization of the rolling workshop, so that the rolling mill can alternately produce steel billets and steel plates, and improve the utilization rate of the equipment. As a result of this, the output of steel plates in this factory next year will increase by more than 40% compared with this year.

　　When compiling the plan, all factories carefully studied the issues of improving quality, saving raw materials and reducing costs. After careful calculation, and formulating specific measures to reduce the head loss rate of steel billets, reduce raw material consumption, and improve labor productivity, the 102 Steel Plant plans to reduce the production cost next year by 19.5 billion yuan compared with the cost expected to be completed this year. The 101 Steel Plant decided to install a shearing machine in the rolling workshop to replace the method of oxygen cutting steel plates to reduce oxygen costs. It also plans to improve the quality of steel plates next year by more than 2% compared with the standards stipulated by the central government.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th -- The state-owned Shenyang Dye Factory, which was criticized by Premier Zhou Enlai in his "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, has learned from the lessons of the past, actively sought advanced factors, and compiled various indicators for the 1955 production plan.

　　In the past, the plan compiled by this factory was very conservative. In 1953, the profit plan was completed more than five times over, precisely because the plan was conservatively set. Premier Zhou cited this as the most prominent example of conservative planning in his report and criticized it. Although the plan for this factory in 1954 was somewhat improved, it was still far from the actual production capacity, and the surplus workers were not transferred, so the annual plan for this year was completed a lot earlier. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the profits turned over to the state can be increased by 12.9 billion yuan.

　　Learning from the lessons of the past, this factory started preparing for the compilation of the 1955 plan earlier this year. The factory leadership held a meeting of all cadres, first the director reviewed and criticized the conservative thinking in the past compilation of the plan, and proposed that the compilation of the 1955 plan should fully consider advanced factors. Then, many cadres also examined their thinking and work. In order to find out the potential of the enterprise, the factory leadership formed a central group for compiling the plan and went deep into various departments to conduct actual investigations. At present, the compilation of the 1955 plan for this factory has been basically completed. According to the preliminary plan, labor productivity next year will increase by 7% compared with the expected level this year, and costs will be reduced by 6.8% (exceeding the national requirements). The consumption indicators of raw materials have also been reduced. For example, the factory currently needs 340 kg of dinitrochlorobenzene to produce one ton of sulfurized cyan. When compiling the plan for next year, they considered that after implementing the Soviet expert's suggestion of "low-temperature alkali addition" and changing the formula in the future, the consumption quota of this raw material would be reduced, so the plan indicator for next year was set at 323 kg. According to the worker quota in the workshop, the labor and wage section also decided to transfer 66 surplus workers and assign them to work in other departments.

    西南钢铁公司所属厂矿和沈阳染料厂
    积极发掘潜力编制明年生产计划
     【新华社重庆讯】西南钢铁公司所属厂矿在编制一九五五年生产财务计划过程中，注意从合理调整现有设备、改进操作技术和改善劳动组织等方面，充分发掘企业的潜在能力。一零一钢铁厂的轧钢能力很大，但因目前厂内钢锭产量和烘锭能力都不能满足轧钢需要，轧钢能力不能充分发挥。这次在编制计划时，一零一钢铁厂决定把现有的烘钢炉加长，提高烘锭能力，并且决定进一步改进原有平炉和新建大型平炉的设备和操作方法，提高钢的产量。一零二钢铁厂为了充分利用轧钢设备能力，已研究出合理调整轧钢车间劳动组织的办法，使轧钢机能交替地生产钢胚和钢板，提高设备的利用率。这样做的结果，这个厂明年仅钢板产量就要比今年提高百分之四十以上。
    各厂在编制计划时，都认真研究了提高质量、节约原材料和降低成本的问题。一零二钢铁厂经过精打细算，并拟订了减少钢胚断头率、降低原材料消耗、提高劳动生产率等具体办法，计划将明年的生产成本比今年预计完成的成本降低一百九十五亿元。一零一钢铁厂决定在轧制车间安装一部剪刀机代替氧割钢板的方法，减少氧气费用。并计划将明年钢板质量比中央规定指标提高百分之二以上。
   【新华社沈阳二十七日电】周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的“政府工作报告”中曾予以批评的国营沈阳染料厂，今年接受了往年的教训，积极寻找先进因素，编制出一九五五年生产计划的各项指标。
    往年这个厂编制的计划是很保守的。一九五三年完成了利润计划的五倍以上，就是因为计划订得保守。周总理在报告中曾把这件事当作计划保守的最突出的例子举出来加以批判。这个厂一九五四年的计划虽然有一些改进，但仍比实际生产能力差很多，多余的工人也没有抽调，所以今年的全年计划又提前很多日子就完成了。预计到年末还可以超额增加上缴利润一百二十九亿元。
    接受往年的教训，今年这个厂比较早地开始了编制一九五五年计划的准备工作。工厂领导方面曾召开全体干部会议，首先由厂长检讨和批判了过去编制计划中的保守思想，提出编制一九五五年计划时应该充分考虑先进因素。接着，很多干部也检查了思想和工作。为了摸清企业潜力，工厂领导方面组成了一个编制计划的中心组，深入各部门去作实际调查。目前这个厂的一九五五年计划的编制工作已基本完成，根据初步确定的计划，明年的劳动生产率将比今年预计达到的水平提高百分之七，成本降低百分之六点八（超过了国家要求）。原料的消耗指标也降低，例如目前这个厂生产一吨硫化青，需要用三百四十公斤二硝基氯化苯。在编制明年计划时，他们考虑到将来贯彻苏联专家“低温加碱”和改变配方的建议之后，这种原料的消耗定额是会降低的，所以把明年的计划指标订为三百二十三公斤。劳动工资科根据车间的工人定额，也决定将多余的六十六名工人抽调出来，把他们分配到其他部门去工作。
