    Large-Scale Grain Farm Begins Survey and Design Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to reports, the site for the grain farm with 20,000 hectares of cultivated land, which the Soviet Union is helping China to construct, has been determined to be in the Sandaogang area of Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province.
    The land consolidation and survey team dispatched by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture departed from Beijing on the 5th to conduct on-site survey and design work. Zhang Shengsan, Deputy Director of the State Farm Administration Bureau of our Ministry of Agriculture, and Wang Caoli, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, also went along. Thirty-five Soviet advisors who are helping our country build this large-scale grain farm have also arrived in Beijing successively. Our Ministry of Agriculture has prepared tools and various equipment for the survey and is transferring agricultural cadres, tractor drivers, and combine harvester operators for training. Party organizations and government agencies in Jiamusi and Jixian in Heilongjiang Province are also actively supporting the construction of the farm, selecting a site in Fulitun near the farm to receive Soviet machinery, and are repairing various houses.
    The soil in the Sandaogang area is fertile, with a black soil layer mostly over one meter thick, and the thinnest being 80 centimeters. Moreover, the terrain is flat, making reclamation relatively easy. From here east to the Ussuri River, south to the Wanda Mountains, and north to the Songhua River, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million hectares of wasteland available for reclamation. Rainfall here is also abundant, and the frost-free period is around 140 days a year, suitable for growing wheat, soybeans, and corn.

    大型谷物农场开始勘查设计工作
    【本报讯】苏联帮助我国建设的拥有两万公顷播种面积的谷物农场场址，已确定在黑龙江省集贤县三道冈地区。
    苏联农业部特派的土地整理考察组，已于五日由北京出发，到现场进行勘查设计。我农业部国营农场管理总局副局长张省三和黑龙江省农业厅厅长王操犁等也一同前往。帮助我国建设这一大型谷物农场的三十五位苏联顾问，也已陆续到达北京。我农业部已准备好勘查用的工具和各种器材，并正抽调农业干部、拖拉机和联合收割机手等，进行训练。黑龙江省佳木斯、集贤等地党的组织和政府机关也积极支援建场工作，在农场附近福利屯选定了接受苏联机器的地址，并正修理各种房舍。
    三道冈地区土壤肥沃，黑土层大部都在一公尺以上，最薄的也有八十公分。而且地势平坦，开垦比较容易。由此东至乌苏里江，南至完达山脉，北至松花江，估计有二百多万公顷的荒地可供开垦。这里雨量也很充足，全年无霜期在一百四十天左右，适于种植小麦、大豆和玉米。
