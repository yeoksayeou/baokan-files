Dear Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

    Today is the eve of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation. Here in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, we solemnly celebrate this glorious festival of great historical significance for the Albanian people. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to the government of the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people.

    1944 was the most memorable year in the history of the Albanian people. In that year, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and with the Soviet army's victorious advance into the Balkan Peninsula, the Albanian people and the People's Army heroically defeated 70,000 fascist occupation troops, liberated the Albanian capital Tirana on November 17, 1944, and completely liberated their own territory on November 29. From then on, the Albanian people forever ended centuries of enslavement and rule by reactionary forces at home and abroad, established a people's democratic system, and embarked on the glorious path of building a socialist happy life.

    The Albanian people are a diligent and brave people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The long-term oppression of Albania by foreign invaders, and the barbaric invasions by Italian fascists and Nazi Germany, have not been able to subdue the freedom-loving Albanian people in the slightest. On the contrary, the long and arduous struggle has made the Albanian people even stronger. The modern history of Albania is a history of the Albanian people's heroic struggle against imperialist oppression and aggression. The Albanian people, with their glorious revolutionary struggle, have written a brilliant page in the epic of mankind's resistance to darkness and violence and struggle for freedom and liberation.

    In the past, the long-term rule of feudalism and the cruel exploitation of imperialism had caused Albania's productivity to stagnate. The destruction during World War II and the frenzied plunder by the fascist invaders had caused enormous damage to Albania's national economy. Therefore, the difficulties faced by the Albanian people after liberation were serious, and the tasks were arduous. However, the heroic Albanian people not only had the strength to liberate their own country, but also had the strength to build their own motherland. After liberation, the Albanian people, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and fighting spirit, victoriously completed the restoration of the national economy in a short period. The people's government successively carried out a series of social reforms, eliminated feudal land ownership, and implemented the nationalization of industry, mines, transportation, and banks, which opened up broad avenues for the development of productive forces. From 1949, Albania implemented a two-year plan for the development of the national economy. By the end of 1950, Albania's industrial output had greatly increased compared to pre-war levels. From 1951, Albania began its five-year plan for economic construction. The main task of this plan was to accelerate the laying of the initial foundations of a socialist economy, so that Albania would gradually transform from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country by the time the plan was completed.

    Over the years, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, have made great achievements in socialist construction. Many modern new industries have been established in the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan, such as the Stalin Textile Factory, the Lenin Hydropower Station, the "November 8th" Sugar Factory, as well as timber factories, tobacco factories, cotton mills, woolen mills, etc. A huge oil refinery, a cement factory, and the largest hydropower station in the country are currently under construction. These industries and enterprises, which have already been put into production or are under construction, play an extremely important role in Albania's economic construction.

    In agriculture, there has also been great progress. The sown area in 1954 increased by 69.7 percent compared to pre-war levels. Due to the expansion of the sown area and the development of agricultural cooperativization, the output of crops is also increasing day by day. At present, the Albanian Labor Party and the government are actively taking various measures, such as developing water conservancy and irrigation, consolidating and developing state farms, tractor stations, and agricultural production cooperatives, in order to vigorously develop agricultural production and further strengthen the consolidated alliance between the working class and the working peasants.

    With the development of the national economy, the material and cultural living standards of the Albanian people have also improved significantly. There have been three price reductions in the past five years, the real wages of workers and the incomes of peasants have been continuously increasing, and consumer goods for the people have become increasingly abundant. Cultural education and health care have also been greatly developed. Illiteracy is being rapidly eliminated throughout the country, primary compulsory education has been implemented, the number of primary and secondary schools has increased several times, and six institutions of higher learning have been established. In addition, many cultural palaces, libraries, cinemas, hospitals, sanatoriums, and nurseries have been established throughout the country in recent years. Undoubtedly, with the progress of socialist construction, the lives of the Albanian people will become even better.

    Now, the Albanian people are closely united around the Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and are confidently continuing to advance along the road of building socialism. The victory of the Albanian People's Assembly elections in May of this year further reflected the Albanian people's full trust and boundless love for the Party and the government.

    Comrades, friends: The Albanian people have been able to achieve such great achievements in this short period of ten years because the Albanian people have become the masters of their own country, and they have brought their enormous creativity into play in the cause of building their happy lives. Like other people's democratic countries, the achievements of the Albanian people's ten years of construction fully demonstrate the great vitality and superiority of the people's democratic system.

    We know that these brilliant achievements of the Albanian people have been won in complex and arduous struggles against enemies at home and abroad. The Albanian people are peace-loving, but they will never allow anyone to infringe upon or destroy their beautiful lives. While carrying out socialist construction, the Albanian people are constantly waging resolute struggles against the sabotage activities of imperialist conspirators, thereby continuously consolidating the people's democratic system. The Albanian people have demonstrated their unwavering will and heroism in the struggle to build socialism and defend the independence and security of their motherland. The Chinese people express their infinite sympathy and admiration for the just cause of the Albanian people.

    An important factor in the Albanian people's victory and the consolidation of their victory is the close cooperation between the Albanian people and the people of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially the fraternal selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union. The solidarity and cooperation between the Albanian people and the people of other fraternal countries are constantly being consolidated and developed.

    Comrades, friends: There is a long distance from China on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean to Albania on the shore of the Adriatic Sea. But thousands of mountains and rivers cannot block our sincere friendship. The Chinese people have always shown concern and admiration for the heroic Albanian people with their glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. In the common struggle for national and social liberation, the people of China and Albania have always shown sympathy and support for each other. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, China and Albania established friendly diplomatic relations for the first time in history. Over the past five years, under the common goal of defending peace and building socialism, the friendly relations between our two peoples have greatly developed. This year, the governments of China and Albania have exchanged ambassadors. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the government of the People's Republic of Albania sent a government delegation headed by Foreign Minister Behar Shtylla to our country to participate in the National Day celebrations and signed two agreements on Sino-Albanian cultural cooperation and technical and technical-scientific cooperation. Recently, our government also sent a government delegation headed by Vice Premier Li Xiannian to Tirana to participate in the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation. All of these mark the rapid development of the fraternal support and friendly cooperation between China and Albania. We are deeply convinced that with the victorious progress of the cause of socialist construction in our two countries, the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Albania and their cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields will be continuously consolidated and developed. This will not only be conducive to the common prosperity and progress of our two countries, but also help to strengthen the world's peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union.

    Comrades, friends: As we warmly celebrate this glorious festival of the Albanian people here, please allow me once again, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to express our sincere respect and congratulations to the fraternal Albanian people, and to wish the Albanian people even more brilliant achievements in the struggle to develop the national economy, improve the people's living standards, and defend world peace under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party.

    Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Albania!
    Long live the People's Republic of Albania!
    Long live Comrade Hoxha, the leader of the Albanian people!
    Long live the powerful world peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union!

    在北京庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年大会上
    国务院秘书长习仲勋的讲话亲爱的大使同志、各位同志、各位朋友：
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年纪念日的前夕，我们在中华人民共和国的首都北京，隆重地庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民这个具有伟大历史意义的光荣节日。首先，请允许我以中华人民共和国政府和中国人民的名义，向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民致以衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    一九四四年是阿尔巴尼亚人民历史上最值得纪念的一年。这一年，阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军队在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在苏联军队胜利进军巴尔干半岛的形势下，英勇地击败了七万法西斯占领军队，在一九四四年十一月十七日解放了阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那，并在十一月二十九日完全解放了自己的国土。从此，阿尔巴尼亚人民永远结束了国内外反动势力数世纪来的奴役和统治，建立了人民民主制度，走上了建设社会主义幸福生活的光辉大道。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民是勤劳勇敢的人民，他们具有光荣的革命传统，外国侵略者对阿尔巴尼亚的长期压迫，意大利法西斯和纳粹德国对她的野蛮侵略，都丝毫没有能够使爱好自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民屈服，相反地，长期的艰苦斗争把阿尔巴尼亚人民锻炼得更坚强了。阿尔巴尼亚的近代历史，是一部阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗帝国主义压迫和侵略的英勇斗争的历史。阿尔巴尼亚人民以自己的光荣的革命斗争，在人类反抗黑暗和暴力、争取自由和解放的史诗上写下了光辉的一页。
    过去，封建主义的长期统治和帝国主义的残酷剥削，曾经使得阿尔巴尼亚的生产力一直停滞不前。第二次世界大战期间的破坏和法西斯侵略者的疯狂掠夺，又使阿尔巴尼亚的国民经济遭受了巨大的损失。因此，阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放以后所面临的困难是严重的，任务是艰巨的。但是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，不但有力量解放自己的国家，更有力量来建设自己的祖国。解放以后，阿尔巴尼亚人民就以无比的劳动热情和战斗的精神，在短期内胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复。人民政权先后进行了一系列的社会改革，消灭了封建的土地所有制，实行了工业、矿山、交通运输业和银行的国有化，这就为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。从一九四九年起，阿尔巴尼亚实行了发展国民经济的两年计划。到一九五○年底，阿尔巴尼亚的工业产量已比战前大大增加。从一九五一年起，阿尔巴尼亚就开始了经济建设的五年计划。这个计划的主要任务是加速奠定社会主义经济的初步基础，使阿尔巴尼亚在计划完成时，将由一个落后的农业国家逐渐转变为一个工业——农业国家。
    这些年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设中已经取得了巨大的成就。在实施五年计划的过程中建立起了许多现代化的新型工业，如斯大林纺织工厂、列宁水电站、“十一月八日”制糖厂，还有木材厂、烟草厂、轧棉厂、毛织厂等，现在尚在建设着巨大的炼油厂、水泥厂和全国最大的水电站。这些已经投入生产的或正在兴建中的工业和企业，在阿尔巴尼亚的经济建设事业中起着极其重要的作用。
    在农业方面，也有很大的进展，一九五四年播种面积比战前扩大了百分之六十九点七。由于播种面积的扩大，农业合作化事业的发展，农作物的产量也日益增加。目前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府正在积极采取下述各种措施，如发展水利灌溉事业，巩固和发展国营农场、拖拉机站和农业生产合作社等，以大力发展农业生产，并进一步加强工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固联盟。
    随着国民经济的发展，阿尔巴尼亚人民的物质和文化生活水平也已有了显著的提高。最近五年实行了三次减低物价，工人的实际工资和农民的收入不断增加，人民的消费品日益丰足。文化教育和卫生保健事业也大大发展了。全国文盲正在迅速消除中，初级义务教育已经推行，初级和中级学校数目增加了数倍，并已建立了六所高等学校。此外，这些年来全国还建立了许多文化宫、图书馆、电影院、医院、休养所和托儿所。无疑地，随着社会主义建设事业的进展，阿尔巴尼亚人民的生活必将更加美好。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正紧密地团结在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的周围，满怀信心地继续沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。今年五月，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会选举的胜利，更加反映了阿尔巴尼亚人民对党和政府充分的信任和无限的爱戴。
    同志们、朋友们：在这短短十年的时期内，阿尔巴尼亚人民所以能够获得如此巨大的成就，是因为阿尔巴尼亚人民已经成为自己国家的主人，他们在建设自己幸福生活的事业中发挥了巨大的创造力。同其他人民民主国家一样，阿尔巴尼亚人民十年建设的成就，充分地说明了人民民主制度的伟大生命力和它的优越性。
  我们知道，阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些光辉的成就，是在同国内外敌人进行复杂的艰苦斗争中赢得的。阿尔巴尼亚人民是热爱和平的，但他们决不允许任何人对他们美好生活的侵犯和破坏。阿尔巴尼亚人民在进行社会主义建设的同时，不断地同帝国主义阴谋分子的破坏活动进行坚决的斗争，从而使人民民主制度得到不断的巩固。阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设社会主义和保卫祖国独立和安全的斗争中，表现了他们坚定不移的意志和英雄气概。中国人民对于阿尔巴尼亚人民的正义事业表示无限的同情和钦佩。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民取得胜利和巩固胜利的一个重要因素，是阿尔巴尼亚人民同苏联和各人民民主国家人民的亲密合作，特别是苏联给予的兄弟的无私的帮助。阿尔巴尼亚人民同各兄弟国家人民之间的团结和合作，正在不断地巩固和发展中。
    同志们、朋友们：从太平洋西岸的中国到亚得里亚海畔的阿尔巴尼亚有着遥远的距离。但是千山万水不能阻隔我们真诚的友谊。中国人民对于富有光荣革命斗争传统的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民一向表示关怀和敬佩。在争取民族解放和社会解放的共同斗争中，中阿两国人民都曾相互寄予同情和支持。中华人民共和国成立以后，中阿两国在历史上第一次建立了友好的外交关系。五年来，在保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同目标下，我们两国人民的友好关系有了很大的发展。今年，中阿两国政府已互派了大使，在中华人民共和国建国五周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府又派遣了以外交部长贝·什图拉同志为首的政府代表团前来我国参加国庆盛典，并签订了中阿文化合作、技术和技术科学合作的两个协定。最近，我国政府也派遣了以李先念副总理为首的政府代表团前往地拉那参加阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年的庆祝典礼。这些都标志着中阿两国间兄弟般的支持和友好合作关系的迅速发展。我们深信：随着我们两国社会主义建设事业的胜利进展，中阿两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和他们在政治、经济和文化方面的合作必将不断地巩固和发展。这不但有利于我们两国的共同繁荣和进步，并有助于以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的增强。
    同志们、朋友们：当我们在这里热烈地庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民这个光辉的节日之际，请允许我再一次以中华人民共和国政府和中国人民的名义向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民表示热诚的敬意和庆贺，并预祝阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在发展国民经济、提高人民生活水平和保卫世界和平的斗争中获得更加辉煌的成就。
    中阿两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的领袖霍查同志万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的世界和平民主力量万岁！
