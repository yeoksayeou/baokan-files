    The National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children held its 1954 annual meeting in Beijing on the 26th.
    The meeting was presided over by Fu Lianzhang, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children. Secretary-General Kang Keqing delivered a report on child protection work at the meeting. She said that with the progress of national construction, the state has carried out various tasks in protecting children's health, improving children's lives, and enabling children to enjoy education, and has achieved good results. The state is deeply concerned about the birth of babies and the growth of children. In recent years, many professional maternal and child health institutions have been established across the country, and many professionals in maternal and child health work have been trained. New methods of delivery and the promotion of parenting knowledge have been widely promoted in cities and vast rural areas. As a result, the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. The number of nurseries opened for female employees of factories, government agencies, and schools across the country (excluding breastfeeding rooms, street nurseries, and rural baby-holding groups) has increased thirty-fold compared to 1949. Currently, 425,000 children are receiving education in kindergartens across the country, an increase of 226 percent compared to 1946, the highest year before liberation. At the same time, nurseries and kindergartens in many cities have begun to learn from advanced Soviet experience and gradually implement all-round development education in physical, intellectual, moral, and aesthetic education. Now, all elementary schools in the country have opened their doors to the children of workers and peasants, and the number of elementary school students has increased by 117 percent compared to 1946, the highest year before liberation.
    Kang Keqing then spoke about work related to children's recreational activities and welfare facilities. Kang Keqing said that there are now nine newspapers and magazines published for children, and more than 3,000 books (including translated works) available for children to read. By 1953, 26 children's films had been produced and translated nationwide. Some large cities have begun to establish children's palaces, children's homes, children's libraries, children's reading rooms, juvenile science stations, children's theater troupes, puppet theater troupes, and children's cinemas. The Central People's Broadcasting Station and local people's broadcasting stations all have regular children's programs. Every summer, some large cities also hold summer camps for children. For the safety and health of infants and young children during travel, 216 trains across the country are equipped with children's carriages, and 75 stations have mother-and-child waiting rooms.
    In her report, Kang Keqing emphasized that although children's work has achieved certain results, there is still much room for improvement in eliminating the bad habits left over from the old society that harm children's physical and mental health, and in educating children in socialist moral character. Intolerable incidents of abuse and maltreatment of children still occur in some places, and further efforts should be made to improve in the future.
    At the meeting, Kang Keqing also introduced the work of the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children over the past three years and put forward a work plan for 1955. The plan mentioned that many concrete measures should be taken to continue to promote our country's achievements in protecting children to foreign countries. Domestically, all relevant parties should be united to continue to promote the construction of children's welfare undertakings, and further effective measures should be taken to stop various undesirable phenomena left over from the old society that endanger children's physical and mental health.
    The members present at the meeting discussed the report. They unanimously expressed satisfaction with the work of the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children in external propaganda and in promoting children's welfare undertakings at home over the past three years. They made serious criticisms of the undesirable phenomena that still exist in society left over from the old society that endanger children's physical and mental health. Many members made many beneficial suggestions in their speeches on how to further emphasize the physical and mental health of children, how to strengthen communist education for children and strengthen parents' education for children, enrich children's scientific and life knowledge, and improve children's toys. They also expressed that they will further strive for the cause of defending children and defending peace in their respective work positions in the future.
    The vice-chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children, Fu Lianzhang and Wei Que, and committee members in Beijing, Fang Shishan, Shi Liang, Li Bozhao, Li Jiansheng, Shen Zijiu, Lin Qiaozhi, Zhou Huakang, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Lian, Cao Mengjun, Tao Shufan, Peng Zemin, Yang Weiyu, Yang Zhihua, Yang Chongrui, Lei Jieqiong, Zhang Xijun, Zhu Futang, Liu Wang Liming, Liu Qingyang, Secretary-General Kang Keqing and other 50 people attended the annual meeting.

    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会举行年会
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会于二十六日在北京举行一九五四年年会。
    会议由中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会副主席傅连暲主持，秘书长康克清在会上作了有关保护儿童工作的报告。她说：随着国家建设的进展，国家在保护儿童健康、改进儿童生活并使儿童享受教育等方面进行了各种工作，并取得了很好的成绩。国家深切关怀婴儿的出生和儿童的成长。几年来，全国建立了许多妇幼保健专业机构，培养了许多妇幼保健工作方面的专业人员，在全国各城市和广大农村中，普遍推行了新法接生和宣传育儿知识。因此，出生的婴儿死亡率已大大降低。全国为工厂、机关、学校女职工开办的托儿所（不包括哺乳室、街道托儿站和农村抱娃娃组），已比一九四九年增加了三十倍。现在，全国已有四十二万五千个幼儿在幼儿园中受教育，比解放前最高年份的一九四六年增加了百分之二百二十六。同时，许多城市的托儿所、幼儿园已开始学习苏联先进经验，逐步实施体育、智育、德育、美育全面发展的教育。现在，全国所有小学也都为工农子弟打开了大门，小学生在校人数比解放前最高年份的一九四六年增加了百分之一百一十七。
    康克清接着谈到有关儿童文娱活动和福利设施等方面的工作。康克清说：现在，全国已有九种为儿童出版的报刊，三千多种可供儿童阅读的图书（包括翻译作品），到一九五三年为止，全国已制成和翻译儿童影片二十六部。有些大城市开始设立了少年儿童宫、少年之家、儿童图书馆、儿童阅览室、少年科学站、儿童剧团、木偶剧团、儿童电影院等。中央人民广播电台和各地人民广播电台都有固定的儿童节目。每到夏季，若干大城市还为孩子们举办夏令营。为了婴儿和幼儿的旅途安全和健康，目前全国已有二百十六辆列车挂有儿童车厢，有七十五个车站设有母子候车室。
    康克清在报告中强调指出：虽然儿童工作获得了一定的成绩，但在肃清旧社会遗留下来的损害儿童身心健康的不良风气方面，在对儿童进行社会主义道德品质的教育方面，做得还是很不够的，不能容忍的虐待和摧残儿童的事件还在有些地方发生，值得今后进一步努力改进。
    康克清在会上还介绍了中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会三年来的工作情况，并提出了一九五五年的工作计划。计划中提到要采取许多具体办法继续向国外宣传我国保护儿童的成就；在国内要联合各有关方面继续推进儿童福利事业的建设，并进一步采取有效措施制止旧社会遗留下来的危害儿童身心健康的各种不良现象。
    到会委员对报告进行了讨论。他们对中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会三年来在对外宣传方面，和在国内推进儿童福利事业方面的工作，一致表示满意。他们对目前社会上还残存的旧社会遗留的危害儿童身心健康的不良现象进行了严肃的批评。许多委员在发言中对如何更进一步重视儿童身心健康的成长，如何加强对儿童的共产主义教育和加强父母对儿童的教育，丰富儿童的科学和生活知识，改进儿童的玩具等方面提出了许多有益的建议。他们并表示今后要在各自的工作岗位上进一步为保卫儿童、保卫和平的事业而努力。
    出席这次年会的，有中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会副主席傅连暲、韦悫，在京委员方石珊、史良、李伯钊、李健生、沈兹九、林巧稚、周华康、陈其瑗、陈琏、曹孟君、陶淑范、彭泽民、杨卫玉、杨之华、杨崇瑞、雷洁琼、张锡钧、诸福棠、刘王立明、刘清扬、秘书长康克清等五十人。（新华社）
