Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 22nd: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on November 21st in Warsaw: A group of crew members from the Polish merchant ship "Worka," who were hijacked by the Chiang Kai-shek pirates in Taiwan for several months, have, through the efforts of the Polish People's Republic government and the crew members' own resolute struggle, finally seen the light of day again and returned to their homeland with the help of the Swedish Red Cross. This group of crew members issued a statement on October 27th, accusing the Chiang Kai-shek pirates of shameless threats, enticements, and persecution against them under the direct instructions of representatives of American imperialism.

The statement first described how the "Worka" was discovered by U.S. Navy aircraft in early October of last year and subsequently hijacked to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The statement said: From the beginning, our ship was occupied by a powerful team of armed military police. On October 12th of last year, a Chiang Kai-shek colonel boarded the ship to interrogate one of our ship's officers, Lewandowski. At the end of October, they made us put our fingerprints on documents, as if we were criminals; in mid-November, they took our pictures, as if for criminal files.

In January of this year, Liu (transliteration), the deputy head of the Taiwan anti-communist secret police, and Wu (transliteration), the deputy head of the Kaohsiung port secret police, began to board our ship. That was when the interrogations began, starting with our ship's officers. Those responsible for the interrogations had prepared questions. They wanted to know our experiences, families, political views, and attitudes toward religion. They were particularly interested in military matters, weapons, and the names of the units we had served in. Despite various threats and intimidations, we refused to answer certain questions. Some of us who had been to American ports were very familiar with these questions. The same questions had been posed to Polish crew members in New York ports. They also raised other questions to us. For example, they asked one of our crew members, Swierczek, whether he would be willing to have contact with the American ambassador.

The intelligence officers in charge of the interrogation constantly urged us to consider the possibility of seeking asylum and the prospect of getting easy work and high salaries on American ships in the future. Throughout the process, they tried to convince us that a third world war was imminent, tried to make us believe in the power of the United States; and said that if we did not want to die, we should side with the American forces.

In February, after we were forcibly taken to the Naval Headquarters, we were surrounded by some women, and photographers, who had been arranged on the spot, immediately took pictures of us with lightning speed. American officers directed this barbaric action in the same building.

The statement pointed out: Those who persecuted us tried every means to undermine the morale of the crew. The crew members were taken for individual talks and subjected to coercion and enticement. They had tried everything possible to make the crew members believe that there was absolutely no legal way to return to Poland. Anyone who refused to sign an asylum application was to be thrown into a Taiwanese prison.

On April 28th, we began a hunger strike. To deal with this struggle, they sent a group of military police and arrested five crew members. The arrested crew members were taken to the General Staff Headquarters, where they were threatened and attempts were made to make them give up their resistance. Due to our firm stance, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had to set a date, telling us that we should make a final decision within a month.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandits then began to adopt new tactics. They interrogated us again and threatened us. On June 1st, we went on hunger strike again. Their response was to send military police and a prison van. They wanted to divide us into groups and arrest some of us to intimidate the rest of the crew. On the fourth day of the hunger strike, we received official notification that we would be repatriated by the Swedish Red Cross.

The statement concluded: After the decision was made on our repatriation, we took our luggage out of the storage room. We met the crew of the "President Gottwald." We learned that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had tried to destroy the morale of our comrades in the same way they had dealt with us. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits continued to torment us until the end. They kept postponing the date of our departure. They did not allow us to contact the Swedish Red Cross delegation. They wanted to make us believe that everyone had forgotten us. It was not until we went on hunger strike again that they had to completely resolve the issue and agree to our return home.

    波兰商船“工作号”船员回国后发表声明
    控诉美国直接指使蒋匪迫害波兰船员
    【新华社二十二日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙二十一日讯：被台湾蒋介石海盗劫持了好几个月的波兰商船“工作号”的一批船员，经过波兰人民共和国政府的努力和船员自己坚决的斗争，才得重见天日，由瑞典红十字会帮助回到了他们的祖国。这批船员在十月二十七日发表声明，控诉蒋介石海盗在美帝国主义的代表的直接指使下对他们进行的无耻的威胁利诱和迫害。
    声明首先叙述了去年十月初“工作号”在被美国海军飞机发现后随即被蒋介石卖国集团劫持到台湾的经过。声明说：在一开始，我们的船就被一队强有力的武装宪兵所占据。在去年十月十二日，蒋介石的一个上校上船盘问我们船上的一个负责人利凡多夫斯基。在十月底，他们使我们盖了指印，好像我们是罪犯一样；在十一月月中，他们又给我们照了像，好像是作为罪犯档案一样。
    在今年一月间，台湾反共秘密警察的副头子刘
  （译音）某和高雄港的秘密警察的副头子吴（译音）某开始上了我们的船。就在那个时候开始审问了，开始时是审问我们船上的负责人。负责审问的那些人都有准备好了的问题。他们想知道我们的经历、家庭、政治见解以及我们对宗教的态度。他们特别想知道军事方面的情况、武器的情况以及我们曾服役的单位的名称等。尽管各种威胁和恫吓，我们拒绝回答某些问题。我们中间有些到过美国港口的人，都很熟知这些问题。在纽约港口，曾经向波兰船人员提出过同样的问题。他们也向我们提出了另一些问题。例如，他们问我们的一个船员斯维尔切克是否愿意和美国大使进行接触。
    负责审问的特务人员不断地要我们注意到有可能得到避难，将来可以在美国船只上得到轻松的工作和高额薪金。在整个过程中，他们试图使我们相信第三次世界大战已临近，试图使我们相信美国的力量；并说，如果我们不愿意死，我们就应当倒向美军那方面。
    在二月里，在我们被用武力强迫带到海军总司令部后，我们被一些妇女所围绕，事先已在现场布置好的摄影人员当即以闪电般的速度给我们拍照。美国军官就在同一建筑物里指挥这个野蛮的行动。
    声明指出：迫害我们的人想尽一切办法来破坏船员们的气节。船员们被带去进行个别谈话，受到威逼利诱。他们曾经千方百计地试图使船员们相信：绝对没有可能用法律办法回到波兰。凡是不肯在一个避难申请书上签字的人就要被投入台湾的监狱。
    在四月二十八日，我们开始绝食斗争。为了对付这个斗争，他们开来一批宪兵，逮捕了五名船员。被逮捕的船员们被带到了参谋总部，他们在那里受到威胁，设法使他们放弃抵抗。由于我们的坚定态度，蒋介石匪徒不得不规定一个日期，他们告诉我们，我们应当在一个月内作出最后决定。
    蒋介石匪徒接着开始采取新的手法。他们再度审问我们，并加以威胁。六月一日，我们又进行了绝食斗争。他们的答复是派来了宪兵并开来了一辆囚车。他们想把我们分成几组，逮捕了我们中间的一些人，以恐吓其余的船员。绝食斗争进行到第四天，我们接到了将由瑞典红十字会把我们遣返的正式通知。
    声明最后说：对我们的遣返问题作出决定后，我们就从储藏室中取出行李。我们见了“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的船员一面。我们获悉蒋介石匪徒曾试图用对付我们同样的方法来摧毁我们的同志的气节。蒋介石匪徒到最后还要折磨我们。他们一直推迟我们启行的日期。他们不让我们跟瑞典红十字会代表团接触。他们想使我们相信所有的人都把我们遗忘了。一直到我们再次进行绝食斗争，他们才不得不彻底解决这个问题，答应我们回国。
