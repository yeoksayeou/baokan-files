    The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    Clears 70 Billion Yuan Worth of Useful Materials from Idle Inventory

    This year, employees of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have cleared out 70 billion yuan worth of useful materials from accumulated idle inventory.

    Some of these materials were stockpiled due to the practice of "preparing generously and using sparingly," while others were substandard materials. More than 50 tons of round steel piled up in the material warehouse can be used to replace the steel bars lacking on site after being processed and modified by the employees. A large number of short-length iron strips accumulated can be welded together to erect 500 kilometers of communication trunk lines. Employees of the Lanzhou Materials Factory found a way to revive more than 30 damaged flatcars, worth more than 100 million yuan. Employees of the internal combustion engine repair shop assembled ten several-year-old scrapped cars into eight trucks and three large flatbed trucks. Employees of the Beidaobu Materials Factory collected parts for hand-operated concrete mixers from piles of steel parts, equipped them with brackets, and assembled five complete concrete mixers. After being cleared and used, these materials have all been supplied to the needs of railway construction.

    This year, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways held three meetings to deal with accumulated materials, criticizing ideas such as "preparing for any eventuality" and "preparing generously and using sparingly." Material factories, warehouses, engineering sections, and engineering teams also mobilized employees to formulate plans for handling idle materials. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 铁道部第一工程局  从呆滞物资中清理出七百亿元的有用材料

    铁道部第一工程局
    从呆滞物资中清理出七百亿元的有用材料
    铁道部第一工程局职工今年从积压的呆滞材料中清理出价值七百亿元的有用材料。
    这些材料有些是因为“宽打窄用”积压下来的，有些是不合规格的材料。材料库里堆积的五十多吨元钢，经过职工们加工改造以后，可以代替现场缺少的钢筋。积压的大量短尺寸的铁板条，经过焊接后，也可以架设五百公里长的通讯干路。兰州材料厂的职工设法复活了三十多辆残破平车，价值一亿多元。内燃机修配厂的职工把报废了好几年的十多辆汽车，拼装成八辆卡车和三辆大平板车。北道埠材料厂的职工从钢铁零件堆里收集了手摇混凝土搅拌机的零件，配上支架，装配了五台完整的混凝土搅拌机。这些物资经过清理和使用以后，都供应了铁路建设的需要。
    中共铁道部第一工程局委员会今年曾召开三次处理积压物资的会议，批判了“有备无患”、“宽打窄用”等思想。各材料厂、仓库和工程段、工程队也发动职工拟订了处理呆滞材料的计划。（新华社）
