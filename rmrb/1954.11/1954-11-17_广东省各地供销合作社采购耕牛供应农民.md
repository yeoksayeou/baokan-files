Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Guangdong Province are actively engaged in managing cattle to meet the needs of farmers for winter planting and next year's spring plowing. More than 30 counties, including Maoming, Danxian, Deqing, Jieyang, and Nanxiong, bought and sold a total of more than 2,900 head of cattle in the third quarter. The Baoting County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 378 head of cattle in early September, most of which have been supplied to farmers. The Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone sold more than 100 head in mid-September. By the end of September, the Dongfang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative had not only supplied more than 100 head of cattle, but also helped farmers adjust more than 50 head among themselves. In order to solve the problem of cattle supply in the Sha Tin area this winter and next spring, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in early September, assisted supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhongshan, Xinhui, Panyu, Zhuhai, Dongguan and other counties with more Sha Tin to organize working groups and absorbed farmers and veterinarians to purchase cattle in Guangxi Province and Hainan Island. By the end of October, the working group had purchased 2,600 head of cattle. Most of these cattle are bulls, fat and large, suitable for cultivation in Sha Tin.

When organizing the source of cattle, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative widely held cattle exchange meetings. According to preliminary calculations, more than ten counties, including Maoming, Wuchuan, Xinyi, Xinfeng, Dongguan, Deqing, and Xingning, have held cattle exchange meetings. Among them, the fifth, seventh, ninth, twelfth, and eighteenth districts of Maoming County held fifteen cattle exchange meetings in September, with a total of 1,788 head of cattle participating in the exchange, and a total of 500 head were traded. Farmers generally welcomed the supply and marketing cooperatives' vigorous management of cattle.

    广东省各地供销合作社采购耕牛供应农民
    广东省各地供销合作社正积极地经营耕牛，以供应农民冬种和明年春耕的需要。茂名、儋县、德庆、揭阳、南雄等三十多个县，在第三季度买卖的耕牛共有二千九百多头。保亭县供销合作社在九月上旬采购的耕牛就有三百七十八头，绝大部分已供应到农民手里，仅第三区供销合作社在九月中旬就卖了一百多头。东方县供销合作社到九月底，不但供应了一百多头耕牛，还帮助农民互相调剂了五十多头。广东省供销合作总社为了解决沙田地区今冬明春供应耕牛的问题，在九月初协助沙田较多的中山、新会、番禺、珠海、东莞等县的供销合作社组织工作组，并吸收农民和兽医参加，分别到广西省和海南岛采购耕牛。到十月下旬，工作组已收购到耕牛二千六百头。这些耕牛大部分是公牛，又肥又大，适宜于沙田耕作。
    广东省供销合作社组织耕牛货源时，广泛召开了耕牛交流会。据初步计算，已召开耕牛交流会的县份有茂名、吴川、信宜、新丰、东莞、德庆、兴宁等十多个县。其中茂名县第五、七、九、十二、十八等区在九月份召开了十五次耕牛交流会，参加交流的耕牛共一千七百八十八头，成交的共五百头。农民们对供销合作社大力经营耕牛，普遍表示欢迎。
