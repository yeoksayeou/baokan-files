Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: The entire Beijing-Shenyang railway line is now double-tracked. The transport capacity of a double-track railway is much greater than that of a single-track railway. From now on, this particularly busy railway transportation artery can accommodate more trains, and the exchange of goods between within and outside the Shanhaiguan will be even more active.

Originally, only part of the Beijing-Shenyang railway was double-tracked. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has continuously carried out renovations to enhance the throughput capacity of the Beijing-Shenyang line. By 1953, most of the section between Beijing and Shanhaiguan had been double-tracked. The newly built section of double-track railway between Beijing and Fengtai also held a commissioning ceremony on New Year's Day this year. Following this, the bridge erection project of the Luan River Bridge and approximately six kilometers of connecting lines on both ends of the bridge were completed this year. The final section—the 158-kilometer double-track project between Xinmin and Shuangyangdian—commenced on January 4th this year and was fully completed on November 12th.

    京沈全线双轨通车
    【新华社十八日讯】京沈铁路全线双轨通车。双轨铁路的运输通过能力比单轨铁路大得多。从此，在这条特别繁忙的铁路交通干线上，便可以容纳更多的列车通行，关内外的物资交流将更加活跃了。
    北京沈阳之间原来只有一部分是双轨铁路。近几年来铁道部为了增强京沈线的通过能力，不断进行整修。到一九五三年北京山海关之间绝大部分实现了双轨通车。北京丰台之间新修的一段双轨铁路也是今年元旦举行通车典礼的。接着，今年内又完成了滦河大桥的架梁工程和大桥两端约六公里的连络线。最后一段——新民到双羊店间的一百五十八公里双轨工程是今年一月四日开工的，到十一月十二日全部完工。
