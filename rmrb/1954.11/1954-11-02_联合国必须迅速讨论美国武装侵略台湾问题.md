On October 21st, the United Nations General Assembly, based on the recommendations of the General Committee following suggestions from Britain and France, decided to postpone for two weeks the consideration of whether to include on the agenda the two items proposed by the Soviet Union: "Violation of Freedom of Navigation in Chinese Seas" and "Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the U.S. Navy for These Acts."

During the General Committee's discussion of these two issues, U.S. representative Lodge vehemently denied the U.S.'s crime of aggression against Taiwan. Moreover, he put on a brave face, claiming that the U.S. did not object at all to including the issue of U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan on the agenda.

In contrast to Lodge's attitude, the representatives of Britain and France did not deny the fact of U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan. However, they disagreed with discussing the issue now. According to the British representative, it seemed that discussing the issue now would re-tension the situation, which had already eased.

It is quite clear that the U.S. is now in a very isolated position on the Taiwan issue. In opposing the discussion of the Taiwan issue, compared to opposing China's participation in the United Nations, the U.S. obviously has less confidence in gathering enough votes of support. In this situation, if it openly opposes the United Nations' discussion of the Taiwan issue, the U.S. aggressor group will completely expose itself as having a guilty conscience. The U.S. refusal to accept the telegram from Foreign Minister Zhou accusing the U.S. of armed aggression against Taiwan, which was forwarded by the UN Secretariat, has already caused criticism from many countries in the UN, who believe that this shows the U.S. has a "guilty conscience." Having learned this lesson, the U.S. is now adopting a deceptive tactic, which is to put on a brave face in the United Nations, saying it does not object to discussing the U.S.'s armed aggression against Taiwan, while at the same time making various gestures to make the situation in the Taiwan Strait tend towards easing, in order to deceive world opinion, so as to indirectly induce the United Nations not to discuss or to delay the discussion of this very urgent issue.

After Foreign Minister Zhou sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, accusing the United States of armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan, on October 12th, Assistant Secretary of State Walter S. Robertson rushed to Taiwan. The U.S. State Department announced that Robertson's mission was to "discuss current and future U.S. aid plans with Chiang Kai-shek," and Robertson himself said that he "studied the overall situation in the Far East and exchanged views on ways to deal with various problems in the region" in his talks with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. But the American propaganda machine has almost unanimously publicized that Robertson was there to order the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to temporarily stop attacking the Chinese mainland.

At the same time, in order to deal with the Soviet proposal regarding the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's piratical acts of intercepting merchant ships, the American propaganda machine also spread the rumour that American diplomats had asked the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to return the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" "as soon as possible."

But behind these smokescreens, the U.S. aggressor group has not relaxed in the slightest its long-term armed occupation of Taiwan and its use of Taiwan as a springboard for aggression against the Chinese mainland. Following closely behind Robertson, many American generals of the Army, Navy and Air Force have visited Taiwan one after another, including U.S. Air Force Strategic Plans Commander Lindsey, U.S. Pacific Air Force Commander Smith, U.S. Army Chief of Staff for Operations and Training Gavin, U.S. Marine Corps Deputy Commander of the Pacific Command McGrig, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, and Commander of Task Force 72 Kivit. Obviously, these American generals did not go to Taiwan for sightseeing, but to turn Taiwan into a sea and air base for U.S. aggression against China, and to make military deployments on how to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. Pride also announced that the U.S. Seventh Fleet had dispatched a number of aircraft to station on the Dachen Islands off the Chinese coast. This is another serious act of provocation against the Chinese people.

At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is still harassing and attacking the Chinese mainland with aircraft and warships supplied by the United States, and has expanded the scope of harassment from the coast to the interior. Another British merchant ship, the "Jeda," was intercepted by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships on October 15th. The coal belonging to Pakistan on the Japanese merchant ship "Nisshu Maru," which had entered Keelung harbor to avoid the typhoon, was also confiscated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on October 14th. The Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" and the Polish merchant ships "Praca" and "President Gottwald" are still being illegally detained in Taiwan. Large numbers of their crew members are being forcibly detained and sent to the United States. Moreover, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group has declared that it will strengthen this piratical behavior of robbing merchant ships on the high seas in the future.

These facts illustrate the truth of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. Unless the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is eliminated and the American aggressor forces withdraw from Taiwan, the situation here will not ease and peace will be seriously threatened. The claim that discussing the issue of U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan in the United Nations would re-tension the eased situation is not in accordance with the facts. This statement is actually providing an excuse for the U.S. aggressor group, so that it can use this excuse to induce the United Nations not to discuss the issue of U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan.

The recent activities of the U.S. aggressor group in Taiwan illustrate one truth: As long as the American armed forces do not withdraw from Taiwan and its nearby islands, the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and the Far East cannot be eliminated. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly has every responsibility, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to discuss the issue of U.S. armed occupation of Taiwan quickly and without further delay. Since the accused party, the United States, has already claimed that it does not object to including the issue of U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan on the agenda, the United Nations General Assembly has even less reason to delay the discussion of this issue.

    联合国必须迅速讨论美国武装侵略台湾问题
    新华社评论员　江南
    十月二十一日，联合国大会通过了总务委员会根据英国和法国的意见而提出的建议，决定推迟两个星期再考虑是否将苏联提出的“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”和“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”两个项目列入议程的问题。
    在总务委员会讨论这两个问题的时候，美国代表洛奇竭力抵赖美国侵略台湾的罪行，而且装出一副好汉的样子，声称美国完全不反对将美国武装侵略台湾问题列入议程。
    和洛奇的态度正好相反，英国和法国的代表完全不否认美国武装侵略台湾的事实，可是他们不同意现在讨论这个问题。依照英国代表的说法，好像联合国现在讨论这个问题，就会使本来已经缓和下来的局势重新紧张起来。
    可以很清楚地看出，美国在台湾问题上现在处于十分孤立的地位。在反对讨论台湾问题上，比起在反对中国参加联合国的问题上，美国显然更加没有把握来搜罗到足够的票数支持。在这种情况下，如果公然反对联合国讨论台湾问题，美国侵略集团就会完全暴露自己是作贼心虚。美国拒绝接受联合国秘书处转发的周外长控诉美国武装侵略台湾的电报，已经引起了联合国中许多国家的非议，认为这表明美国“内心有疚”。接受了这个教训，美国现在采取了一种欺骗策略，这就是一方面在联合国里硬着头皮表示不反对讨论美国武装侵略台湾问题，另一方面却做出使台湾海峡局势趋向缓和的种种姿态，来欺骗世界舆论，以便通过间接的途径，使联合国不讨论或者拖延讨论这个十分迫切的问题。
    在周外长致电联合国大会主席，控诉美国武装侵略中国领土台湾之后，十月十二日，美国助理国务卿华尔特·斯·罗伯逊就赶到了台湾。美国国务院宣布罗伯逊的任务是去“和蒋介石讨论目前和将来的美国援助计划”，罗伯逊自己也说他在和蒋贼会谈中“研究了整个远东地区的局势，并对应付这个地区的各项问题的方法交换了意见”。但是美国的宣传机器却几乎众口一词地大肆宣传说罗伯逊是去命令蒋介石卖国集团暂时不要攻击中国大陆的。
    同时，为了应付苏联提出的关于蒋介石卖国集团拦劫商船的海盗行为的提案，美国宣传机器还散布空气说，美国外交人员已经要求蒋介石卖国集团“早日”交还苏联的“图阿普斯号”油船。
    但是在这些宣传烟幕后面，美国侵略集团丝毫没有放松它长期武装侵占台湾和以台湾为侵略中国大陆跳板的迹象。紧跟着罗伯逊之后，又有不少美国的陆、海、空军将领先后到台湾进行活动，其中包括美国空军战略计划司令部司令林塞，美国太平洋空军司令史密斯，美国陆军作战训练参谋处处长盖文，美国太平洋司令部海军陆战队副司令麦克格里，美国第七舰队司令普赖德和第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特。很明显，这些美国将军们到台湾去并不是为了游山玩水，而是为了把台湾变成美国侵略中国的海、空军基地，和从军事上部署如何阻挠中国人民解放台湾。普赖德并且宣布，美国第七舰队已经派遣了一批飞机驻在中国沿海的大陈岛上。这是对中国人民的又一个严重的挑衅行为。
    与此同时，蒋介石卖国集团仍然在用美国供给的飞机、军舰骚扰和攻击中国大陆，而且把骚扰的范围从沿海扩大到了内地。又有一艘英国商船“吉达号”在十月十五日遭到了蒋贼军舰的拦劫。因为躲避台风而驶入基隆港的日本商船“日洲丸”上的属于巴基斯坦的煤，也在十月十四日被蒋贼军没收。苏联的“图阿普斯号”油船和波兰商船“工作号”、“哥特瓦尔德总统号”仍然被非法扣留在台湾。它们的船员正在被大批强迫扣留并被送往美国。而且，蒋介石卖国集团宣称，它今后还要加强这种在公海上打劫商船的海盗行为。
    这些事实说明了台湾海峡局势的真相，蒋介石卖国集团不消灭，美国侵略势力不退出台湾，这里的局势就不会缓和下来，和平就受着严重的威胁。所谓联合国讨论美国武装侵略台湾问题会使已经缓和的局势重新紧张起来的说法，是不符事实的。这种说法实际上只是替美国侵略集团提供一个借口，使它可以利用这个借口来诱使联合国不讨论美国武装侵略台湾问题。
    美国侵略集团最近在台湾的活动说明了一个真理：只要美国武装力量不从台湾和它附近的岛屿上撤走，台湾海峡和远东的紧张局势就无法消除。因此，联合国大会完全有责任依照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，迅速而不再拖延地讨论美国武装侵占台湾的问题。既然受到指责的当事国美国已经声称不反对将美国武装侵略台湾的问题列入议程，联合国大会就更加没有任何理由拖延这个问题的讨论了。
