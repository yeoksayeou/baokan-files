Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 15th:

    October was the month with the lowest cotton consumption for Shanghai's nineteen state-owned cotton textile factories this year. Among these nineteen factories, eleven factories reduced their unit cotton consumption compared to the previous month. From the overall average, the cotton used to spin one yarn in October was reduced by 1.38 *jin* compared to the previous month. The state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory, with the lowest cotton consumption, reduced the cotton consumption for spinning one 32-count yarn to 389.46 *jin*. In total, the factories saved 70,200 *jin* of cotton in October compared to September. This amount of cotton can be used to weave 6,500 bolts of cloth.

    According to past practices, cotton consumption tends to increase in September and October because new cotton has not yet entered the market, old cotton is almost used up, and the raw cotton contains more impurities. This year, thanks to the efforts of the factory workers, cotton consumption in September and October not only did not increase but decreased compared to August, while the quality of the yarn remained at the original level, and the product quality of some factories even improved.

    In late September, the factories began to prepare intensively for the fourth quarter's cotton-saving work. On the one hand, the factories summarized the experience of saving cotton in the third quarter and set the saving targets for the fourth quarter; at the same time, the Communist Party organizations in the factories also mobilized the masses of workers to check for waste and study ways to eliminate it. In terms of technical measures, the factories paid special attention to reducing the cotton waste from the doffers of the carding machines in October. This problem was discovered in the third quarter. At that time, it was calculated that if the cotton waste from the doffer of the carding machine increased by 0.5%, nearly two *jin* of cotton would be used more for each yarn. Therefore, in October, the factories paid attention to solving this problem. The Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory experimented with modifying the grid leak bottom of some carding machines into a full mesh leak bottom, and the amount of cotton waste was reduced from 1.37% to 0.77%, while the quality of the cotton sliver was not affected. Other factories installed cotton collectors, and some factories arranged different grades of cotton in order, eliminating confusion during cotton mixing, which played a significant role in saving cotton.

    Currently, the East China Textile Administration Bureau has further strengthened its leadership in the work of saving raw cotton. Cotton-saving groups have been established in the Hudong and Huxi areas, where cotton textile factories are concentrated, with the participation of the heads of the spinning workshops from each factory. The groups hold meetings once or twice a month to specifically summarize and exchange the experiences of saving cotton in various factories.

### 上海国营纺织业十月份节约棉花七万多斤

    上海国营纺织业十月份节约棉花七万多斤
    【新华社上海十五日电】十月份，是上海十九个国营棉纺织厂今年以来用棉量最低的一个月。这十九个厂中，有十一个厂的单位用棉量都比上月降低。从总平均数来看，十月份纺一件纱用的棉花比上月降低了一点三八市斤。用棉量最低的国营上海第十六棉纺织厂纺一件三十二支纱的用棉量已降低到三百八十九点四六市斤。总计各厂在十月份共比九月份节省了七万零二百市斤棉花，用这些棉花可以纺织出六千五百匹布。
    按照往年惯例，九、十月份因新棉没有上市，陈棉将近用完，原棉含杂质较多，用棉量往往上升。今年由于各厂职工努力，九、十两个月的用棉量不仅没有增加，反比八月份减少，而纱的品质仍然保持原有水平，部分厂的产品质量还有提高。
    九月下旬，各厂就开始紧张地准备第四季度节约用棉的工作。各厂一方面总结第三季度节约用棉的经验，订出第四季度的节约指标；同时，各厂中的共产党组织，也发动职工群众检查浪费和研究消灭浪费的办法。在技术措施方面，十月份各厂特别注意了减少梳棉机后车肚的落棉。这个问题是在第三季度中发现的，当时计算了一下，如果梳棉机后车肚落棉量增加百分之零点五，每件纱就要多用将近两斤棉花，因此在十月份各厂都注意解决这个问题。上海第五棉纺织厂试验把一部分梳棉机的炉栅漏底改装为全网眼漏底，落棉量就从百分之一点三七减少到零点七七，而棉条质量并没有受到影响。其他有的厂安装集棉器，有的厂把不同等级的棉花进行排队，消除了混棉时的混乱情况，对节约用棉都起了很大作用。
    目前，华东纺织管理局更加加强了对节约原棉工作的领导。沪东、沪西两个棉纺织厂集中的地区已分别成立了节约用棉小组，由各厂纺部工场长参加。小组每月召开一次到两次会议，专门总结和交流各厂节约用棉的经验。
