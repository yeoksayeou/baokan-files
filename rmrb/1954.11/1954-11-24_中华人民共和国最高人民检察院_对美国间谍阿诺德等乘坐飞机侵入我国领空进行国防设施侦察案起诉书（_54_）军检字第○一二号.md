Indictment Against American Spies Arnold et al. for Intrusion into Our Airspace by Aircraft for Reconnaissance of National Defense Facilities
(54) Jun Jian Zi No. 012

On the evening of January 12, 1953, the Northeast Air Defense Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down an American B-29 aircraft that had sneaked into our country's airspace in Liaoning Province to conduct espionage reconnaissance activities. The wreckage of the aircraft crashed west of Huangwan Village, west of Wulongbei in Andong City. Arnold, Baumer, and ten other Americans on board the aircraft who were carrying out criminal activities were captured in Xinkang Village and Laogugou Village in the Wulongbei District. A portable radio transceiver for ground use and survival equipment, weapons, parachutes, and other criminal tools were seized. After interrogation by our Northeast public security organs, the defendants Arnold et al., along with the evidence and confessions, were transferred to this procuratorate. After inspection by this military prosecutor, it has been confirmed that the aircraft and crew that sneaked into our country were from the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," and the captured Arnold is the colonel commander of this wing. The U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" is a wing performing special missions. It serves the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and is one of the air force wings specifically used to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Its task is to airdrop espionage agents and supply materials to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, and maintain communication with ground espionage agents. This wing was established at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, USA, in July 1951 and was transferred to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines in July 1952. The main purpose of this wing's deployment to the Far East was to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Far East coastal region.

I. JOHN KNOX ARNOLD JR., from Washington, D.C., USA, male, 41 years old. He is the colonel commander of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing." The wing he leads is an air force wing serving the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, specializing in carrying out the sinister activities of airdropping supplies, contacting, and retrieving ground special agents and spies against China and the Soviet Union. It is stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines, using the name of the Air Force and performing "psychological warfare" missions as a cover to the outside world. On January 12, 1953, Arnold led the other defendants on a modified B-29 aircraft, serial number 44-62217, and sneaked into our country to conduct espionage reconnaissance and attempt to carry out sinister activities such as providing supplies and contacting American spies, and was finally captured by us.

II. WILLIAM HURLBAUMER, from Pennsylvania, USA, male, 32 years old. He is the Major Operations Officer of the "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron" of the U.S. Far East Air Force. He has repeatedly used aircraft to carry out reconnaissance activities to probe our national defense facilities. On January 12, 1953, he colluded with Arnold et al. to sneak into our country to conduct espionage reconnaissance and other criminal acts, and was finally captured by us.

III. EUGENE JOHN VAADI, from New York, USA, male, 33 years old. He is the captain pilot of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing." On January 12, 1953, he personally piloted the aircraft, colluded with Arnold et al. to sneak into our country to conduct espionage reconnaissance and other criminal acts, and was finally captured by us.

IV. WALLACE LA-MER BROWN, from Alabama, USA, male, 28 years old, he is the Second Lieutenant co-pilot of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; ELMER FRED LLEWELLYN, from Montana, USA, male, 29 years old, he is the Captain Navigator of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; JOHN WOODROW BUCK, from Tennessee, USA, male, 35 years old, he is the Lieutenant Bombardier of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; HOWARD WILLIAM BROWN, from Wisconsin, USA, male, 32 years old, he is the Staff Sergeant Mechanic of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; STEVE EDWARD KIBA, from Virginia, USA, male, 22 years old, he is the Sergeant Radio Operator of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; HARRY MARTIN BENJAMIN JR., from Minnesota, USA, male, 22 years old, he is the Corporal Left Observer and Jumpmaster of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; DANIEL CHRIS SCHMIDT, from South Dakota, USA, male, 22 years old, he is the Corporal Center Observer of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing"; JOHN WALKER THOMPSON, from Virginia, USA, male, 23 years old, he is the Corporal Right Observer of the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing." The above eight defendants are all crew members of the U.S. B-29 aircraft, serial number 44-62217, because they flew the aircraft and accompanied Arnold et al. to sneak into our country to conduct espionage reconnaissance and other criminal acts, and were finally captured by us.

Comprehensive facts prove that the U.S. "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" is a special air force wing used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to directly endanger the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Before being shot down and captured, the American aircraft and crew that sneaked into our country were assigned by the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" to the "91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron" under the U.S. Far East Air Force Bomber Command at Yokota Air Base in Japan; this squadron specifically targets China and the Soviet Union for reconnaissance. Arnold and Baumer personally led the Vaadi crew to sneak into our country to carry out the sinister espionage reconnaissance activities and attempted to carry out the sinister activities of providing supplies and contacting American spies, directly endangering our national security and undermining our people's democratic cause and peaceful life. A public prosecution is hereby filed, requesting that severe punishment be imposed in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries."

The Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China
The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China

    对美国间谍阿诺德等乘坐飞机侵入我国领空进行国防设施侦察案起诉书
   （54）军检字第○一二号
    中国人民解放军驻东北某防空部队，于一九五三年一月十二日晚在辽宁省境内上空，击落偷入我国境内的美国B—29型进行间谍侦察活动的美国飞机一架；该机残骸坠落在安东市五龙背以西荒湾村的西面；并在五龙背区新康村、老古沟村等地捕获乘坐该机实施犯罪行为的阿诺德、包莫等十一名美国人；缴获地面使用的轻便无线电收发报机一架和野外用的求生用具、武器、降落伞等犯罪用具。被告人阿诺德等经我东北公安机关侦讯后连同罪证及供词移交本检察院。经本军事检察员检察证实：这架偷入我国国境的飞机和机组人员，是属于美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的，捕获的阿诺德就是这个联队的上校司令官。美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”是一个执行特殊任务的联队。它是为美国中央情报局服务的，专门用来对苏联和人民民主国家进行间谍破坏活动的空军联队之一。它的任务，就是向苏联和人民民主国家空投间谍分子和供给使用的补给物资，并和地面间谍分子保持通讯联络。这个联队于一九五一年七月在美国爱达荷州山家空军基地成立，于一九五二年七月调驻菲律宾克拉克空军基地。这个联队的调驻远东，主要就是为的对中华人民共和国和苏联远东滨海地区进行间谍特务破坏活动。
    一、约翰·诺克斯·阿诺德（JOHN KNOXARNOLD JR．），美国华盛顿城人，男，现年四十一岁。他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官。他所领导的这个联队，就是给美国中央情报局服务的专门对中国和苏联进行空投接济、联络和接回地面特务间谍分子等罪恶活动的空军联队，驻于菲律宾克拉克基地，以空军名义和执行“心理作战”任务作为对外的掩护。一九五三年一月十二日，阿诺德率领其他被告人乘坐B—29型机号四四—六二二一七经过改装的飞机，偷入我国境内，进行间谍侦察并企图进行接济和联络美国间谍分子等罪恶活动，终于被我捕获。
    二、威廉·赫尔·包莫（WILLIAM HURLBAUMER），美国宾夕法尼亚州人，男，现年三十二岁。他是美国远东空军“九一战略侦察中队”的少校作战官。曾多次乘用飞机进行刺探我国防设施的侦察活动。一九五三年一月十二日又伙同阿诺德等偷入我国境内进行间谍侦察等犯罪行为，终于被我捕获。
    三、尤金·约翰·维地（EUGENE JOHNVAADI），美国纽约州人，男，现年三十三岁。他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上尉机长。一九五三年一月十二日亲自驾驶飞机，伙同阿诺德等偷入我国境内进行间谍侦察等犯罪行为，终于被我捕获。
    四、华莱斯·拉马尔·布朗（WALLACE LA-MER BROWN），美国亚拉巴马州人，男，现年二十八岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的少尉副驾驶员；埃尔默·弗雷德·刘维林（ELMER FRED LLEWELLYN），美国蒙大拿州人，男，现年二十九岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上尉领航员；约翰·伍德罗·布克（JOHN WOODROW BUCK），美国田纳西州人，男，现年三十五岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的中尉投弹员；霍华德·威廉·布朗（HOWARD WILLIAM BROWN），美国威斯康星州人，男，现年三十二岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上士机械士；斯蒂夫·爱德华·齐巴（STEVE EDWARD KIBA），美国弗吉尼亚州人，男，现年二十二岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的中士报务员；哈里·马丁·彭介民（HARRY MARTIN BENJA-MIN JR．）美国明尼苏达州人，男，现年二十二岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的下士左观察员兼跳伞长；丹尼尔·柯里斯·施密特（DANIEL CHRIS SCHMIDT），美国南达科他州人，男，现年二十二岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的下士中心观察员；约翰·瓦尔克·汤普逊（JOHN WALKER THOMPSON），美国弗吉尼亚州人，男，现年二十三岁，他是美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的下士右观察员。以上八名被告人，都是B—29型机号四四—六二二一七美国飞机的维地机组人员，因为驾驶该机，随同阿诺德等偷入我国国境进行间谍侦察等犯罪行为，终于被我捕获。
    综合上述事实证明：美国“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”是美国中央情报局用来直接危害中华人民共和国和苏联的一个特务空军联队。这个偷入我国境内的美国飞机和机组人员，在击落捕获前，由“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”配属给日本横田空军基地的美国远东空军轰炸机司令部所属的“九一战略侦察中队”；该中队专以中国和苏联为侦察目标。阿诺德与包莫亲率维地机组偷入我国境内进行罪恶的间谍侦察活动，并企图进行接济和联络美国间谍分子等罪恶活动，直接危害我国国家安全，破坏我国人民民主事业和和平生活。特此提起公诉，请按“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”严加惩处。
