    Kalinin on Broadcasting
    Zou Xiaoqing
    The Soviet Communist Party has always attached importance to broadcasting, a modern and powerful tool for propaganda. Lenin once called broadcasting "a newspaper without paper and without distance." Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet broadcasting industry has developed rapidly.
    During the Patriotic War, Kalinin had a conversation with newspaper and radio reporters, which was later published under the title "On Journalists and Communications." In this article, Kalinin correctly explained the enormous role played by newspapers, broadcasting, etc., in propaganda, pointing out the fundamental differences between Soviet newspapers and broadcasting and bourgeois newspapers and broadcasting. He provided a brilliant analysis of the characteristics of broadcasting in particular, and specifically proposed requirements for the content and form of broadcasting.
    Kalinin said: "In modern society, newspapers, broadcasting, and film play a huge role. As tools of propaganda and agitation, they have a great influence on the formation of public opinion." He particularly pointed out: "Compared to newspapers, broadcasting serves far more people." "Broadcasting, in terms of its scale and its mass nature, is probably the most powerful tool of propaganda and agitation."
    Kalinin exposed the nature of bourgeois broadcasting as deceiving the people:
    "Their mission is to praise and embellish the existing social and economic way of life and the various systems suited to this way of life, constantly and with various reasons propagating to the masses the idea that this way of life and these systems are perfectly suited to human nature, and therefore they are 'natural', and this way of life and these systems are the best." In bourgeois broadcasting, "sensational news, interesting episodes, criminal cases, political scandals, and family disputes among prominent figures occupy a very important position," "as a means of attracting listeners, and also as a way of diverting people's attention, so that they do not analyze and understand reality."
    But in front of Soviet broadcasting, "there are more lofty tasks and what I would say are incomparably broader tasks: not to serve individual, small groups of privileged people, but to serve all the people," "to develop, enlighten, and educate the broad masses, and to instill in their minds the noblest and most humane principles of common human life." Soviet broadcasting "strives to make the people accustomed to keenly watching various phenomena in real life, understanding these phenomena, and incorporating these phenomena into the overall track of the lawful development of our Soviet society."
    Kalinin went on to say: But this does not mean that our broadcasting "must become less popular and less interesting, that the communist theory itself must limit their liveliness, their richness, their brilliance, and that their main form must be instructive or sanctimonious narratives. Not at all! On the contrary, it is precisely this attitude, it is precisely Marxism-Leninism that opens up unlimited scope for activity for our journalists and broadcasters, enabling them to engage in inspired creation on the basis of a true understanding of the development of human society."
    Kalinin pointed out: Broadcasting journalists "should have definite ideological viewpoints," "should have Party spirit," and should "learn to express this viewpoint and Party spirit creatively. Every literary essay, communication, and every radio program should be realistic and full of ideological content." "It is necessary to find the relationship between each individual phenomenon and the general phenomenon (the unity of the part and the whole)."
    Kalinin criticized the naturalistic bias in radio writing, opposed the sloganization and formalization of propaganda, and demanded that "individual facts should be described with a very objective attitude, but the impression given by this description... should be to make him understand Party spirit."
    Kalinin criticized the typical communications that "only describe people's material achievements" when introducing advanced figures. He said: "This is not enough. Our lives are gradually becoming more complex, the people are becoming more cultured, and their spiritual demands are also increasing." "It is necessary to express a person along with his psychological aspects, expressing his spiritual experience, his thoughts, his cultural level, his role in society and even in science, his ability to work, while emphasizing that his achievements are not accidental, but the result of his spiritual strength's consistent tension, the result of his conviction that his labor is beneficial to society, I would say, the result of his full of lofty aspirations; that is to say, he understands that his labor is not a simple physical effort, and at the same time it satisfies his spiritual requirements."
    Kalinin made the following demands on reporters: "They should go in and out of various circles of Soviet society, familiar with the urgent issues that these circles are concerned about," "observe and diligently study" local life, and write about the "most noteworthy and most concerned" things in the local area; they should learn from those honest writers, and put "deep feelings and efforts" into "their works." Only in this way can they influence readers and listeners.
    When analyzing the differences between broadcasting and newspapers, Kalinin directly pointed out the basic characteristic that broadcasting is transmitted to listeners through sound.
    "Short comments, essays, and articles, etc., are not read by people, but listened to by people. When you read a newspaper, you usually grasp the most important things and let go of the unimportant things, which is the work of the eyes. But when you listen, then every word, and how the hearing feels it, is very important. If vision is at work when reading, then hearing and the transmitted sound determine the effect when listening. The problem is that the same meaning cannot always be expressed equally effectively for reading and for listening."
    Based on this characteristic, Kalinin required that radio manuscripts "should be written concisely," and be "extremely clear and easy to understand," and also "how to choose forms to make the reports interesting," "the writing work should be very careful, and grammatical errors must be absolutely eliminated." Before broadcasting, "listen to it to see if people will turn off the radio when listening to such a program, or conversely turn on the radio louder so that the program can be heard more clearly and listen to it all the way through." Kalinin said: "Reporters often write about construction, industry, agriculture, and culture in purely documentary language. This is not good. Reporters should make their essays, reports, or articles attractive in form." Efforts should be made to make the audience feel interested, "even arouse their curiosity, so that the audience will not turn off the radio."
    Kalinin then put forward such a task to Soviet broadcasting workers: "The time is ripe for literary creation in broadcasting to have some special forms."
    Kalinin cited some successful examples in Soviet radio programs. A special radio program was held to commemorate the author of "Woe from Wit," Griboyedov. The program was very interesting, "We want to use the lessons of our past history to teach people how to deal with current problems, to teach people to develop noble qualities, to develop their desire for ideality. When introducing them to this writer, we also educate them by the way." The radio program for people who grow vegetable gardens (during the war, many urban residents in the Soviet Union responded to the Party's call to cultivate vacant land to supplement the insufficient supply from rural areas) broadcast many speeches and suggestions, "which met the urgent needs of the broad residents of our cities, and they felt interested in this material. That is to say, we have also found appropriate forms for implementing the Party's line here." The radio program for young people "is not bad. It is necessary to systematically introduce new scientific works, and various inventions and discoveries to our young people. So here, if we invite the best representatives of our scientific and technical fields to speak in front of the microphone, it would be a good thing. ... This matter itself is very interesting, and it will also bring some diversity to radio programs."
    Kalinin advocated that various topics of reviews should be run on the radio. In addition to the existing international reviews, there should also be reviews of local life in various parts of the country, reviews on issues of individual technology, science, literature, art, and national economic sectors, "These reviews should be brief, at most fifteen to twenty minutes," "It does not have to be broadcast every day, but two or three times a month is enough."
    Kalinin also pointed out: "In addition to daily news reports, reviews, and essays, etc., broadcasting also has a dominant aspect like music broadcasting. Usually, people regard the music broadcast on the radio as just a kind of pastime, but in addition, they are invisibly learning how to sing correctly, learning new tunes, cultivating their musical tastes, and improving their musical knowledge."
    Kalinin attached great importance to the connection between broadcasting and the audience. He said: "I feel that although our broadcasting reports many useful news and extensively and detailedly reports to the residents, it seems to be performing routine duties when it works, and has not established a close relationship with the audience." He pointed out that it is not easy to establish this connection, "When you are speaking to a visible audience, you usually look at the people sitting in front of you, try to make contact with them, establish direct mutual influence, and then you will not be indifferent to the audience. If you are not indifferent to the audience, they will not be indifferent to you. The radio audience is completely another matter: here, first, there are many listeners; second, one cannot see anyone. How should one contact such an audience so that they are not indifferent to you, and how can one grab their attention? To do this, every radio journalist must be able to imagine that he has a class of listeners, must be able to 'see' and 'feel' that they are in front of you."
    Kalinin advocated broadcasting letters from the audience, "introducing one's own policies to the audience" on the radio, and soliciting the audience's opinions on arranging programs. He believed that radio programs should meet the needs of the audience. He asked for cultivating radio journalists, radio commentators, radio essay writers, radio sketch writers, and this type of literary radio worker who are popular with the audience and familiar to the audience. He said: "This can help broadcasting and the audience to get closer."
    When learning from the advanced experience of Soviet broadcasting work, Kalinin's instructions are what we should deeply understand!

    加里宁论广播
    邹晓青
    广播这一现代化的有力的宣传工具，一直受到苏联共产党的重视。列宁曾称广播为“不用纸张和没有距离的报纸”。在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联的广播事业一日千里地发展着。
    加里宁在卫国战争时期，曾对报纸记者和广播记者们作过一次谈话，谈话记录后来以“论记者和通讯”为题发表了。在这篇文章里，加里宁曾正确地说明了报纸、广播等在宣传方面所起的巨大作用，指出苏联的报纸、广播和资产阶级的报纸、广播中间的原则区别；特别对广播这一工具的特点作了精辟的分析，并具体地提出了对广播的内容和形式的要求。
    加里宁说：“在现代社会中，报纸、广播和电影，起着极大的作用。作为宣传和鼓动的工具，它们对于人们舆论的形式有着很大的影响。”他特别指出：“和报纸比较起来，广播所服务的人要多得多。”“广播，就它的规模和它的群众性来讲，大概是最有力的宣传鼓动工具了。”
    加里宁揭露资产阶级广播的欺骗人民的本质：
    “它们的使命都是歌颂和粉饰现存的社会经济生活方式以及适合于这种方式的各种制度，经常地并且用种种理由向群众鼓吹一种思想，就是这种方式和这些制度是完全适合于人类的天性，因此它们是‘天然的’，这种方式和这些制度是最好的。”在资产阶级广播里，“耸人听闻的消息、有趣的插曲、刑事案、政治丑闻和显要人物中间的家庭纠纷等等占着很重要的地位”，“作为吸引听众的手段，同时又作为一种转移人们的注意力的方法，使他们不去分析和了解现实。”
    可是在苏联广播面前，“摆着更崇高的任务和我要说是无比广泛的任务：不是为个别的、一小撮特权者的小集团服务，而是为全体人民服务”，“发展、启发和教育广大的群众，在他们的意识中灌输人类共同生活的最高贵和最人道的原则”。苏联广播“极力使人民惯于敏锐地注视着现实生活中的各种现象，了解这些现象，并把这些现象纳入我们苏维埃社会的合乎规律的发展的总轨道”。
    加里宁接着说：但是这绝不是说，我们的广播“必须成为不大通俗和不大有趣，共产主义理论的本身一定要限制它们的活泼生动、它们的丰富多采、它们的鲜明华丽，它们的主要形式必须是教训的或是道貌岸然的叙述。一点也不是！相反地，正是这样的态度，正是马克思列宁主义给我们的新闻工作者和广播工作者打开了无限的活动范围，使他们可以在真正了解人类社会发展的基础上从事有灵感的创作”。
    加里宁指出：广播记者“应该有确定的思想观点”，“应该有党性”，应该“学会创造地表现这种观点和党性。应当使每一篇文艺随笔、通讯和每一个广播节目都是现实主义的，充满了思想内容的”。“应该找出每个个别现象和总的现象的关系
  （部分和整体的统一）”。
    加里宁批判广播稿件写作中那种自然主义的偏向，反对宣传中的标语口号化和公式化，要求“要用非常客观的态度来描写个别事实，但是这篇描写给人的印象……却应该是使他了解党性”。
    加里宁对“只描写人的物质成就”那种介绍先进人物的典型通讯给以批评。他说：“这是不够的，我们的生活逐渐复杂化起来，人民变得更有文化，他们的精神方面的要求也就更多。”“一定要把一个人连他的心理方面都表现出来，表现他的精神体验、他的思想、他的文化程度、他在社会上甚至在科学上所起的作用，他的工作能力，同时强调出他的成就并不是偶然的，而是他的精神力量的一贯地紧张的结果，是他确信他的劳动是有益于社会的信念的结果，我要说，是他的满怀着崇高憧憬的结果；那就是说，他了解他的劳动并不是简单的体力的努力，同时这还满足了他精神的要求。”
    加里宁向记者们提出了这样的要求：“应该出入于苏维埃社会的各种不同的圈子，熟悉这些圈子所关心的那些迫切的问题”，“观察并勤恳地研究”当地的生活，写当地的“最引人注意和最为人关心的事”；应该学习那些诚实的作家，“在自己的著作里”放进“深厚的感情和心血”。这样才能影响读者和听众。
    当分析广播和报纸的不同时，加里宁直捷地指出了广播是用声音来传达给听众的这一基本特点。
  “短评、随笔和文章等等，不是被人家阅读，而是被人家听的。当你看报的时候，普通总是抓住最重要的而放过不重要的，这是眼睛的工作。可是当你听的时候，那么每一个字的声音，以及听觉怎样感受它，都有很大的关系。假如在阅读时是视觉在起作用，那么在听的时候就要由听觉和播送的声音来决定效果。问题是在于：对于阅读和对于收听，绝不是常常能把同一个意思同样有效地表现出来。”
    根据这一特点，加里宁要求广播的稿件“要写得简洁”，做到“极度明白易懂”，还“应该挑选怎样的形式使报道变得有趣”，“编写工作应该是很细心的，必须绝对消灭文法上的错误。在播出之前要“试听一下，看看人们在收听这样的节目时，是不是会关上收音机，或者相反地把收音机开得更响，使节目可以听得更清楚，并且一直把它听完”。加里宁说：“记者往往用纯粹纪录式的文字来写建设、工业、农业和文化等。这样是不行的。记者应该做到使他们的随笔、报道或文章，在形式上都是吸引人的。”应该设法使听众感觉兴趣，“甚至激起他们的好奇心，使听众不会关上收音机”。
    加里宁接着向苏联广播工作者提出了这样一个任务：“广播中的文学创作需要有一些特殊形式的时机已经成熟了。”
    加里宁举出苏联广播节目中一些成功的例子。在纪念“聪明误”的作者格里包耶多夫的时候举办了特别广播节目，节目办得很有趣，“我们要用我们过去的历史的教训来教人怎样处理当前的问题，教人养成高贵的品质，养成他们对思想性的渴望。在向他们介绍这位作家的时候，顺便也就教育了他们”。为种菜园的人办的广播（苏联在战时有许多城市居民响应党的号召，辟隙地种菜，以补农村供应的不足）播送了许多讲话和建议，“是符合我们各城市里广大居民阶层的迫切要求，他们对这种材料感觉兴趣。那就是说，我们在这里也找到了执行党的路线的适当的形式”。对青年的广播节目“办得还不坏。需要有系统地向我们的青年介绍新的科学作品，介绍各种不同的发明和发现。所以在这里如果请我们科学界和技术方面最优秀的代表人物到话筒前来讲话，那是一件并不坏的事情。……这件事本身就是很有趣的，同时也会给广播节目带来一些多样性”。
    加里宁主张广播里要办各种题目的述评，除已有的国际述评外，还要国内各地生活的述评，关于个别技术、科学、文学、艺术和国民经济部门的问题的述评，“这些述评应该是简短的，至多十五到二十分钟”，“不必每天播送，而是每月两三次就够了”。
    加里宁还指出：“广播除了日常的时事报道、述评和随笔等等之外，还有着像音乐广播那样占优势的一面。通常人们把广播中播送的音乐只是作为一种消遣，但是除此之外，他们无形中还学会着怎样正确地唱歌，学会新的曲调，培养自己的音乐趣味，提高本身的音乐知识。”
    加里宁非常重视在广播中与听众的联系。他说：“我觉得，我们的广播虽然报道了许多有益的消息，广泛而详细地向居民作了报道，然而它在工作的时候好像是在执行例行公事，并没有跟听众建立起密切的关系。”他指出建立这种联系并不是很容易的，“当你在对看得见的听众说话的时候，普通你总是望着坐在你面前的人们，设法和他们发生联系，建立直接的相互影响，那时你对听众就不会漠不关心。假如你对听众不是漠不关心，他们对你也不会漠不关心。广播听众就是完全另外一回事：在这里，第一，听众很多；第二，一个人也看不见。应该怎样和这样的听众联系，使他们对你不是漠不关心，和怎样抓住他们的注意力呢？要做到这一点，每个广播记者必须会想像自己有一班听众，必须会‘看见’和‘感到’他们是在你面前”。
    加里宁主张播送听众来信，在广播中“向听众介绍一下自己的方针”，并征求一下听众对于安排节目的意见。他认为办广播节目应该符合听众的需要。他要求培养受听众欢迎、为听众熟悉的广播记者、广播评论员、广播随笔作家、广播小品文作家以及这一类文学广播工作者。他说：“这可以帮助广播和听众更密切地接近起来。”
    在学习苏联广播工作的先进经验的时候，加里宁的这些指示是我们应该深刻体会的！
