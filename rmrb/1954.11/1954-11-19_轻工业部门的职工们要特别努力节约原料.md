The Ministry of Light Industry of the People's Republic of China, the Local Industry Department, the Light Industry Workers' Union Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly convened the National Oil and Fat Industry Advanced Experience Exchange Conference from October 25th to November 3rd. After full discussion and repeated research, the conference believed that the advanced oil extraction technology and experience, mainly the Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method of the Siping Oil and Wine Factory in Jilin Province, should be vigorously promoted in the national oil and fat industry in order to improve the oil yield of raw materials and reduce the residual oil rate in the cake. The conference also set a plan to increase the national output of vegetable oil by 200 million catties in 1955, on the condition of ensuring quality. This is a major event that should attract the attention of all employees in various industrial sectors, especially the light industry production sectors.

Under the condition of ensuring product quality, continuously reducing the consumption of raw materials and rationally utilizing national resources is the regular task of all employees in socialist enterprises. For all employees in the light industry production sectors, striving to conserve raw materials, fully utilizing substitutes, increasing production, and further meeting the needs of the people's lives, and expanding socialist accumulation, is currently the most urgent and important political task.

Light industrial products can be divided into three major categories: food, clothing, and daily necessities. It has the most direct relationship with people's lives. As people's purchasing power increases, they demand more high-quality and inexpensive food and beverages, and more high-quality and inexpensive textiles and daily necessities. China is a large country with a population of 600 million. As long as the consumption level of each person increases a little, the increase in the demand for light industrial products nationwide will be astonishing. If each person eats half a catty more oil per year on average, the national demand will increase by 300 million catties; if each person eats four taels more sugar per year on average, the national demand will increase by 150 million catties; if each person makes one more piece of clothing per year on average, the national demand will increase by 30 to 40 million bolts of cloth. The lives of the broad masses of people will gradually improve with the increasing development of socialist construction and socialist transformation. To meet the growing needs of the people's lives, it is necessary to vigorously develop light industry. However, it is impossible to vigorously develop light industry in the near future. This is because: first, China's original industrial base is weak, and now it is necessary to first concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry, and the development of light industry can only be corresponding and limited. Second, we know that the industrial raw materials for food, clothing, and some daily necessities are all agricultural products. Under the conditions of backward agriculture and industry, it is impossible to greatly increase the production of industrial raw material crops. Without modern agricultural machinery, it is impossible to expand the cultivated area by large-scale land reclamation; without rural collectivization and sufficient chemical fertilizers, it is impossible to greatly increase the yield per unit area. Also, because China's grain production is also limited, it is impossible to increase the production of light industrial raw materials by reducing the area of grain cultivation. At present, the raw materials for light industry cannot meet the needs of the development of light industry, and this situation cannot be completely overcome in the short term. Next year will be the year with the largest construction scale in China's history. According to the needs of people's lives and national construction, light industry must have a certain development. However, this year the production of many cash crops has not been completed as planned due to floods, and the shortage of raw materials for light industry will be even more serious. Therefore, it is an even more important task for employees in the light industry departments to strive to conserve raw materials, explore various raw material resources, and expand the scope of use of substitutes in order to increase the output and new varieties of light industrial products.

Realizing socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization is the fundamental way to solve the contradiction between the development of industry not keeping up with the needs of people's lives and the development of agriculture not keeping up with the development of industry in our country. At present, the state's implementation of planned supply of light industrial products such as grain, edible oil, and cotton cloth, as well as the planned mobilization of farmers to increase cash crops, are all effective measures taken to overcome this contradiction, to ensure the appropriate needs of people's lives, and to stabilize the market. These measures are very necessary and timely, and have won the heartfelt support of the people of the whole country. However, if the employees of the light industry department can vigorously conserve raw materials, and can manufacture more and better quality products than before with the same amount of raw materials, then the planned supply quantity of some industrial products can be appropriately increased. People can get more light industrial products.

The employees of various light industry production departments strive to conserve raw materials, increase production, and can also accumulate a large amount of funds for the country's socialist construction. If the national textile enterprises can reduce the amount of cotton used per yarn by an average of two catties, the cotton saved nationwide throughout the year can spin more than 20,000 yarns. Using these yarns to weave cloth is enough for more than 6 million people to make a set of clothes, and the increased income for the country can build three textile factories with 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. If oil extraction workers can extract an average of one and a half catties more oil from every 100 catties of raw materials, the edible oil increased nationwide in one year is enough for tens of millions of people to eat for a year, which can increase a lot of income for the country. These two examples show that every worker's attention to conservation and overcoming waste is of utmost importance to increasing the country's accumulation. The idea that "individual saving is useless" and "wasting a little is nothing" are wrong and should be overcome.

In the past few years, like other industrial departments, the light industry production departments have made varying degrees of achievements in conserving raw materials and using substitutes due to the gradual improvement of the political consciousness and technical level of the workers, and the gradual improvement of enterprise management. However, the phenomenon of wasting raw materials is still very common, and is even very serious in some enterprises. This is manifested in the fact that manufacturing the same product with the same quality of raw materials, often due to the different technical levels of workers and the different quality of production management, the amount of raw materials consumed by each factory is different, the amount of raw materials consumed by each production team in the same factory is different, and the amount of raw materials consumed in this month is also different from that in the next month. Taking the amount of cotton used per yarn as an example, advanced factories only use 390 catties to 393 catties, but many factories use about 400 catties. In September of this year, the average amount of cotton used per yarn in the factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau was 12 catties more for the highest than the lowest. If we summarize and promote the experience of advanced departments or advanced units, and reduce the amount of raw materials consumed by each factory to the level of the average advanced quota, and each team strives to learn from the advanced team in terms of the amount of raw materials consumed, then the consumption of raw materials will be reduced, and the same amount of raw materials can increase the output of more products. After the Shandong Provincial People's Government Industry Department promoted the advanced experience of Li Chuanjiang oil extraction in various oil factories, an average of one to two catties more oil was produced from every 100 catties of soybeans, two catties more oil was produced from every 100 catties of cottonseed, and four to five catties more oil was produced from every 100 catties of peanuts. Some oil and fat factories in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South China have also had similar results after initially promoting this advanced oil extraction experience.

The potential power of light industry departments to conserve raw materials is very great. After studying the general line, discussing the draft constitution, educating on the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain, edible oil, cotton cloth, and cotton, and studying the documents of the National People's Congress, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been further improved. As long as the Party and trade union organizations explain the significance of conserving raw materials to the workers, as long as the administrative leaders of the enterprise are good at summarizing and promoting advanced technical experience, and correspondingly improve the management of the enterprise, and effectively overcome bureaucracy, the employees of the light industry departments can fully exert their labor enthusiasm and creativity, in order to fully utilize China's resources, strive to conserve raw materials, so as to manufacture more, better, and cheaper products with the same raw materials to supply the needs of the people, and make new contributions to accumulating more funds for national construction.

### 轻工业部门的职工们要特别努力节约原料

    轻工业部门的职工们要特别努力节约原料
    中华人民共和国轻工业部、地方工业部、中华全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会和中华全国供销合作总社，于十月二十五日到十一月三日，联合召开了全国油脂工业先进经验交流大会。经过了充分的讨论和反复的研究，大会认为应在全国油脂工业中，大力推广以吉林省四平油酒制造厂李川江榨油法为主的一些先进榨油技术经验，以便提高原料出油率，降低饼内残油率。大会并订出了在保证质量的条件下，在一九五五年为国家增产植物油脂两亿斤的计划。这是应该引起各个工业部门，尤其是轻工业各生产部门的全体职工们注意的一件大事。
    在保证产品质量的条件下，不断地减少原材料的消耗，合理利用国家资源，是社会主义企业内全体职工的经常任务。对轻工业各生产部门的全体职工来说，努力节约原料，充分利用代用品，增加生产，进一步满足人民生活需要，扩大社会主义积累，更是当前最迫切的一项重大政治任务。
    轻工业的产品，可以分为吃的、穿的和用的三大类。它跟人民生活有着最直接的关系。人民的购买力提高了，就要求更多质好价廉的食品和饮料，要求更多质好价廉的纺织品和日用品。我国是一个有六亿人口的大国，只要每一个人的消费水平提高一点，全国需要增加的轻工业品就很惊人。平均每人每年多吃半斤油，全国就需要增加三亿斤；平均每人每年多吃四两糖，全国就要增加一亿五千万斤；平均每人每年多做一件衣服，全国就要增加三、四千万匹布。广大人民的生活将随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益发展而逐步提高；要满足人民生活日益增长的需要，就要求大力发展轻工业。但是，在今后一定时期内，大力发展轻工业是不可能的。这是因为：第一、我国原有的工业基础薄弱，现在必须首先集中主要力量发展重工业，轻工业的发展只能是相应的和有限度的。第二、我们知道，吃的、穿的和部分用的工业原料，都是农产品。在农业、工业都很落后的条件下，要大大增加工业原料作物的生产是不可能的。因为没有现代农业机械，就不可能大规模垦荒来扩大耕种面积；没有农村的合作化，没有充足的化学肥料，就不可能大大提高单位面积产量。又由于我国粮食的生产也有限，所以不能用减少粮食种植面积的办法来增加轻工业原料的生产。目前轻工业原料不能满足发展轻工业的需要，这种情况在短期内是不能完全克服的。明年是我国有史以来建设规模最大的一年。根据人民生活和国家建设的需要，轻工业必须有一定的发展，但是，今年许多经济作物的生产却因遭受水灾而没有完成计划，轻工业原料不足的情况将更加严重。因此，轻工业部门的职工努力节约原料，发掘各种原料资源，扩大代用品的使用范围，以增加轻工业品的产量和新的品种，就是更加重要的任务了。
    实现社会主义工业化和农业合作化，是解决我国工业发展赶不上人民生活的需要、农业发展又赶不上工业发展这个矛盾的根本道路。目前，国家对粮食、食油、棉布等轻工业品实行计划供应，以及有计划地发动农民增加经济作物等，都是为着克服这个矛盾，为着保证人民生活的适当需要，为着稳定市场而采取的有效措施。这些措施是很必要和适时的，是获得了全国人民的衷心拥护的。但是，如果轻工业部门的职工能够大力节约原料，能够以同样数量的原料，制造出比从前更多的质量更好的产品来，那就可以适当增加若干工业产品的计划供应数量。就可以使人民得到更多的轻工业品。
    轻工业各生产部门的职工们努力节约原料，增加生产，还可以为国家的社会主义建设积累大量的资金。如果全国纺织企业能把每件纱的用棉量平均降低两斤，则全国全年节约的棉花可以纺二万多件纱，用这些纱来织布，足够六百多万人每人做一套衣服，给国家增加的收入可以建设三个具有五万纱锭一千台布机的纺织厂。如果榨油工人能在每一百斤原料中平均多榨出一斤半油，全国一年增加的食油足够数千万人一年的食用，可给国家增加很多收入。这两个例子说明了每一个工人都注意节约，克服浪费，对于增加国家的积累就有着极其重要的意义。那种认为“个人节约没啥用”、“浪费点不算什么”的思想都是错误的，应该克服。
    几年来，轻工业各生产部门也跟其他工业部门一样，由于职工群众的政治觉悟和技术水平的逐步提高，由于企业管理工作的逐步改善，在节约原材料，利用代用品方面有了不同程度的成绩。但是，浪费原料的现象还很普遍，在某些企业里甚至是很严重的。这表现在用一样质量的原料制造一样的产品，往往由于工人技术高低不同、生产管理好坏不同，各个工厂所耗费的原料数量不一样，同一个工厂内各个生产小组所耗费的原料数量不一样，这一个月份跟那一个月份所耗费的原料数量也不一样。以每一件纱的用棉量为例，先进工厂只用三百九十斤到三百九十三斤，不少工厂却用四百斤左右。华东纺织管理局所属各厂今年九月份每件纱平均用棉量，最高的比最低的多十二斤。如果我们通过总结和推广先进部门或先进单位的经验，把各个工厂的原料耗用量降低到平均先进定额的水平，各个小组的原料耗用量都努力向先进小组看齐，那么，原料的消耗量降低，同样数量的原料就可以增加出更多的产品来。山东省人民政府工业厅所属各油厂推行了李川江榨油的先进经验后，平均每一百斤大豆多出一斤到两斤油，每一百斤棉籽多出两斤油，每一百斤花生多出四斤到五斤油。东北、华北、华东、中南等地一些油脂工厂初步推广这个先进榨油经验后也有类似的结果。
    轻工业部门节约原料的潜在力量是很大的。广大的职工群众经过了总路线的学习，经过了关于宪法草案的讨论、关于粮食、食油、棉布、棉花统购统销政策的教育和全国人民代表大会文件的学习，社会主义的觉悟已进一步提高。只要党和工会组织对职工讲清节约原料的意义，只要企业的行政领导善于总结和推广先进的技术经验，并相应地改善企业的管理工作，切实克服官僚主义，轻工业部门的职工们就能充分发挥劳动积极性和创造性，为充分利用我国资源，为努力节约原料，以便用同样的原料制造更多、更好、更便宜的产品以供应人民的需要，并为国家建设积累更多的资金而做出新的贡献。
