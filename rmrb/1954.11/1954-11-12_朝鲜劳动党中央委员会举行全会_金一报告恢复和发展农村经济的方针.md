    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 11th: Pyongyang newspapers published on the 4th the report by Kim Il, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, at the November plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, regarding "The Party's Future Struggle Guidelines for Rapidly Restoring and Developing the Rural Economy."

    Kim Il said: Rapidly restoring and developing the rural economy is one of the important tasks of the Labor Party and the Republic's government. Without the rapid recovery and development of the rural economy, it will be impossible to solve the problem of rapid recovery and development of industry, the future industrialization of Korea, and improving and raising the people's living standards. In his report, Kim Il pointed out that although the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang brought profound disasters to the vast rural areas of North Korea after launching the war, thanks to the rural policies implemented by the Labor Party during the war, millions of working farmers were firmly united around the Party and the government, overcame unprecedented difficulties, uninterruptedly guaranteed spring plowing and autumn harvest, and timely supplied grain needs to the front and rear. The total grain output in 1953 was 2,565,000 tons, a decrease of 230,000 tons compared to 2,795,000 tons in 1949; however, the rice output in 1953 was 1,368,000 tons, an increase of 127,000 tons compared to 1,241,000 tons in 1949. Kim Il said that we can proudly say that our rural economy not only did not regress during the war, but also maintained the level before the war, and new economic systems such as agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned, and provincial-operated farms and ranches have made progress and development.

    When talking about the various tasks for developing the rural economy in North Korea in the future, Kim Il first elaborated on the goals set for the rural economy in the post-war three-year economic plan. Grain output by 1956 should increase by 19 percent compared to 1949, of which rice should increase by 31 percent. There will be corresponding increases in vegetables, fruits, tobacco, and silk. In order to effectively complete the task of developing the rural economy, it is first necessary to reorganize cultivated land, restore land damaged by war and natural disasters, and wasteland, reclaim new land, and vigorously improve the soil and build water conservancy projects.

    Kim Il pointed out that the basic task of striving to increase crop yields is: to expand the cultivated area by more than 50,000 chongbo across the country in 1955, and expand the sown area by 130,000 chongbo compared to 1954. The unit yield per chongbo of paddy fields should be increased to four tons, and dry land to two tons, in order to successfully complete the task of producing more than 3.6 million tons of grain.

    After pointing out the tasks of strengthening and developing animal husbandry, state-owned farms and ranches, and sericulture, Kim Il talked about the policy of further developing the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. He said: From 1954, agricultural production cooperatives were piloted in some areas under the principle of retaining private land and private means of production. In this regard, great achievements have been initially made. Rural areas across the country have organized agricultural production cooperatives under the principle of farmers' voluntary participation. Today, the number of cooperatives has reached more than 7,100, and it is still increasing. Our agricultural production cooperatives have only just stepped into the pilot stage, but it has proven that it has huge advantages over individual farming and shows a broad prospect for developing my country's rural economy and improving farmers' lives.

    In his report, Kim Il also talked about improving the work of agricultural machinery rental stations, strengthening the study of agricultural technology and training technical cadres, and improving the procurement of agricultural products. Finally, Kim Il talked about strengthening the Party's political work in the countryside. He said: The key to whether we can solve the problem of poor farmers in the next two or three years lies in whether we constantly educate the peasants, make them see the superiority of the cooperative economy through reality, and guarantee them various material conditions for transitioning to the cooperative economy.

    Kim Il said: Ensuring the rapid development of industry and agriculture and further seeking the overall upsurge of the national economy is a strong material guarantee for promoting the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会举行全会
    金一报告恢复和发展农村经济的方针
   【新华社平壤十一日电】平壤报纸四日发表了朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会委员金一在劳动党中央委员会十一月全体会议上所做的关于“劳动党为迅速恢复和发展农村经济的今后斗争方针”的报告。
    金一说：迅速恢复和发展农村经济是劳动党和共和国政府的重要任务之一。没有农村经济的迅速恢复和发展，就不能解决迅速恢复和发展工业的问题、朝鲜今后的工业化问题以及改善和提高人民生活问题。金一在报告中指出，尽管美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮在发动战争后给朝鲜北部的广大农村带来了深重灾害，但由于劳动党在战时所实行的农村政策，使数百万劳动农民坚强地团结在党和政府的周围，克服了前所未有的困难，不间断地保障了春耕和秋收，及时供应了前后方的粮食需要。一九五三年的谷物总产量是二百五十六万五千吨，虽然比一九四九年的二百七十九万五千吨减少了二十三万吨；但是一九五三年的稻子产量为一百三十六万八千吨，比一九四九年的一百二十四万一千吨增加了十二万七千吨。金一说，我们可以骄傲地说：我国的农村经济在战争时期不但没有退步，而且保持了战争以前的水平，并且像农业生产合作社、国营和道营农牧场等新的经济体系，都有了进步和发展。
    谈到今后朝鲜北部发展农村经济的各项任务时，金一首先阐述了战后三年经济计划中为农村经济规定的目标。谷物产量到一九五六年要比一九四九年增加百分之十九，其中水稻增加百分之三十一。蔬菜、水果、烟草、蚕丝均有相应的增加。为了有效地完成发展农村经济的任务，首先要整理耕地，恢复遭到战争和自然灾害的土地以及荒芜的耕地，开垦新的土地，并大力改良土壤，兴修水利。
    金一指出争取提高农作物收获量的基本任务是：要在一九五五年在全国扩大耕地面积五万多町步，比一九五四年扩大播种面积十三万町步。水田每町步单位产量提高到四吨，旱田提高到两吨，以便胜利地完成生产三百六十万吨以上谷物的任务。
    金一在指出加强和发展畜牧业，国营农牧场和养蚕业方面的任务后，谈到进一步发展农业互助合作运动的方针。他说：从一九五四年起，在保有私有土地和私有生产工具的原则下，在部分地区试办了农业生产合作社。在这方面，已初步取得了巨大的成绩。各地农村在农民自愿原则下纷纷组织农业生产合作社。今天，只合作社的数目就已达七千一百多个，现在还在继续增加。我国农业生产合作社不过刚踏上试办的阶段，但已证明了它比单干有着巨大的优越性，并显出了发展我国农村经济和提高农民生活的广阔远景。
    金一在报告中还谈到了改进农业机器代耕站和加强研究农业技术及培养技术干部的工作，关于改进农产品的收购工作。最后，金一谈到加强党在农村的政治工作。他说：我们在最近两三年内能否解决贫苦农民问题的关键在于是否对农民不断地进行教育，通过现实使他们看到合作经济的优越性，并给他们保障过渡到合作经济的各项物质条件。
    金一说：保障工农业的迅速发展，进一步谋求人民经济的全面高涨，这就是促进我们祖国和平统一的坚强的物质保证。
