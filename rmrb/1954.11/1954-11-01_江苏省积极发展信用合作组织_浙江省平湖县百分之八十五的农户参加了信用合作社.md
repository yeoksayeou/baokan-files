    Jiangsu Province is actively developing credit cooperative organizations. According to incomplete statistics from the end of September, 1,566 new credit cooperatives, 41 credit departments, and 2,987 credit groups have been established. The newly established credit cooperatives have reached more than half of the province's development plan for this year. These newly established credit cooperative organizations are actively carrying out business activities in conjunction with the current procurement of agricultural products and disaster relief for production. In Tai County, 21 credit cooperatives and 70 credit groups absorbed deposits of over 1 billion yuan in early September, which, after loans were made, were deposited in banks; the Zhenxi Township Credit Cooperative in the Dongshan District of Zhenze County absorbed deposits of over 17 million yuan in cooperation with the ginkgo procurement work alone.
    In order to vigorously develop credit cooperative organizations, Jiangsu Province actively cultivated and trained credit cooperative cadres. The method of training cadres in various places is generally to hold short-term training courses for credit cooperative cadres. After training, many cadres and activists realized the important role of credit cooperative organizations, understood the policy of running cooperatives and groups, and learned some basic knowledge of business. Songjiang, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Huaiyin and other special districts also trained cadres who specifically led the credit cooperative work in counties and districts, taking the special district as a unit. According to statistics from more than 50 counties and cities including Jiangning, Danyang, Wuxi, Kunshan, Nantong, Tai County, Tongshan, and Funing, more than 7,000 backbones for carrying out credit cooperative work had been trained by the end of September. After the first batch of cadre training in Jiangning County, more than 60 new credit cooperatives have been established by the end of September, more than double the original number. In Yixing County, there were only three credit cooperatives at the end of August, and by the end of September, the number had grown to thirty-seven.

    Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, has comprehensively launched the work of developing credit cooperative organizations since June. At present, 38 credit cooperatives and 5 credit departments have been established in 42 townships throughout the county, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounts for more than 85% of the total number of farmers in the county; the number of people participating in the credit cooperative in Xincang Township accounts for 98% of the total number of people who can participate in the township. These credit cooperative organizations have collected more than 1 billion yuan in shares and absorbed 2.05 billion yuan in deposits.
    These credit cooperative organizations have made great achievements in supporting agricultural production and combating usury. In the overproduction campaign in July and August, the eleven credit cooperatives in Xincang District timely lent farmers 830 million yuan in loans for livestock and fertilizers, ensuring the increase in rice production in the entire district. The rice fields of the Wu Yinkui mutual aid group in Wu Shan Village, Xin Gang Township, originally lacked fertilizer, and the rice did not grow well, and some members once wanted to withdraw from the group. The township credit cooperative took the initiative to lend them 3.5 million yuan for fertilizer, and they bought a batch of fertilizer powder, vegetable cakes, bean cakes, and superphosphate, and carried out timely topdressing. Now the average rice yield per mu in the entire group is more than 800 jin. This group is now actively preparing to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. In the past, some households in Xincang Township needed to borrow high-interest loans, and the farmers compared borrowing high-interest loans to "drinking brine when thirsty." After having the credit cooperative, farmers can obtain nine types of loans for agricultural tools, plowing cattle, fertilizer, childbirth, medical treatment, buying food, buying pigs, feed, and funerals, with a monthly interest rate of only 1.5%. The farmers happily said: "With our own 'small bank', we don't have to hold the 'brine bowl' anymore!"

    江苏省积极发展信用合作组织
    浙江省平湖县百分之八十五的农户参加了信用合作社
    江苏省积极发展信用合作组织。据九月底的不完全统计，已新建信用合作社一千五百六十六个，信用部四十一个，信用组二千九百八十七个。新建的信用合作社，已达该省今年发展计划的半数以上。这些新建的信用合作组织，结合当前农产品收购和生产救灾工作，积极展开业务活动。泰县二十一个信用合作社、七十个信用组，在九月上旬吸收的存款，除贷放以外转存银行的有十亿余元；震泽县东山区镇西乡信用合作社，仅配合收购白果工作即吸收存款一千七百余万元。
    为了大力发展信用合作组织，江苏各地积极培养和训练了信用合作干部。各地训练干部的方式，一般都是举办短期的信用合作干部训练班。许多干部和积极分子经过训练以后，认识到信用合作组织的重要作用，懂得了办社办组的方针，并学习到了一些业务上的基本知识。松江、徐州、扬州、淮阴等专区，还以专区为单位，对县、区具体领导信用合作工作的干部进行了训练。据江宁、丹阳、无锡、昆山、南通、泰县、铜山、阜宁等五十多个县、市的统计，到九月底止，已训练开展信用合作工作的骨干七千多人。江宁县在第一批干部训练结束以后，到九月底已新建六十多个信用合作社，比原有的增加一倍以上。宜兴县在八月底只有三个信用合作社，九月底已发展到三十七个。

    浙江省平湖县从六月份起，全面开展了发展信用合作组织的工作。目前，全县四十二个乡已成立三十八个信用合作社和五个信用部，入社农户占全县总农户百分之八十五以上；新仓乡参加信用合作社的人数，占全乡可参加人数的百分之九十八。这些信用合作组织共收纳股金十亿元以上，吸收存款二十亿五千万元。
    这些信用合作组织已经在支持农业生产、打击高利贷等方面作出不少成绩。新仓区十一个信用合作社在七、八月间的超额增产运动中，及时贷给农民牲畜和肥料贷款八亿三千多万元，保证了全区稻谷的增产。新港乡吴山村吴银奎互助组的稻田原来因为缺肥，稻不发棵，部分组员一度曾想退组。该乡信用合作社主动贷给他们三百五十万元肥料款，他们买了一批肥田粉、菜饼、豆饼和过磷酸钙，及时进行追肥，现在全组水稻平均每亩产八百斤以上。这个组现在正积极准备转成农业生产合作社。新仓乡过去有一些户需要借高利贷，农民们把借高利贷比作是“口渴喝盐卤”。有了信用合作社以后，农民可以得到农具、耕牛、肥料、生育、看病、买食粮、买猪、饲料、丧事等九种贷款，月息只有百分之一点五。农民们都高兴地说：“有了我们自己的‘小银行’，就不用再捧‘盐卤钵头’了！”
