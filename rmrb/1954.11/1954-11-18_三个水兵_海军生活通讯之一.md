    Three Sailors
    ——One of Naval Life Communications
    By Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin
    In that hot late August, I arrived at our naval base. At this time, in addition to intense field exercises, the sailors also engaged in a period of current affairs study every day.
    At half past two, the watch bell in the corridor woke the sailors napping in the bunkroom. Then came the "dudu" whistle, and the sailor on watch blew the whistle while shouting: "Study time, study time!" No matter how long the electric fans in the bunkroom rotated, no matter how the ventilators sent in the wind, it was still unbearably hot. All the sailors walked out of the bunkroom onto the deck. On the broad deck, the sailors of the forward main gun occupied the shadows of the turret. They were in this large area of shade, both enjoying the cool and holding discussions.
    The squad leader of the forward main gun, with a smug smile, read an article describing the changes in Heitao Village in Hebei Province after embarking on mutual aid and cooperation. Before the War of Resistance, the twenty-six households in Heitao Village had only seven head of livestock, and the mountain land yielded an average of only eighty-one catties of grain per mu. At that time, except for three families who did not buy grain to eat, the rest lived a life of "bran and vegetables for half a year." Now the village has sixty-seven head of livestock and four hundred and eighty sheep. Since the establishment of mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, the average yield per mu has been three hundred and eighty catties of grain. Of the twenty-six households in the village, the surplus grain of the existing four households is enough to eat for six years, four households can eat for four years, and the rest can eat for two years. In the past, there were no trees on the hills; this year, more than a thousand apple trees have begun to bear fruit, and the income from peaches can match a wheat harvest. The squad leader paused after reading the article. At this time, some sailors lowered their heads as if imagining the beautiful and prosperous Heitao Village; some turned their eyes to the nearby islands; others looked out at the distant ocean, as if wanting to see the boundless waves and any traces of the enemy. The sea breeze gently blew the hatbands behind the sailors' heads.
    "Squad leader, isn't this developing too fast?" asked a young man with a somewhat mischievous look.
    Another dark-faced sailor patted the questioner's head and said, "Isn't it good to develop fast? You don't study hard. A few years ago, the country didn't even have warships! Look at our big fleet of warships. Our country is amazing. I think it won't be fifteen years before we reach socialist society." This speaker was called Lin Baoguo. His clean naval uniform did not hide the appearance of a farmer. He said that he had gone home to see things a while ago, and the changes in the village were really great. Households in the village that used to have nothing to eat now have more than enough.
    These sailors, some said their plains had changed, some said their mountain gullies had changed, some said their fishing grounds had changed, and some said their cities had changed. When it came to talking about the changes in their motherland, the sailors had so much to say. This discussion only stopped after the stalls for eating dinner were set up on the deck. In fact, they were still talking about how things had changed here and were unrecognizable there while eating.
    After dinner, I was enjoying the cool on the deck when I met that sturdy, dark young man, Lin Baoguo, again. He asked me again how Beijing was being built, how the crops in the interior were doing, asking this and that, even the smallest things he asked about. Lin Baoguo said: "Our motherland can't do without a navy. From 1949 to 1950, Chiang Kai-shek's warships were still parked at the mouth of the Yangtze River, blockading our Shanghai. At that time, not only did our maritime transportation have difficulties, but the coastal fishermen could not produce properly. Later, we had airplanes and a navy, and we drove the enemy warships away from our territorial waters. Now the enemy warships dare not face our navy." Lin Baoguo is the rangefinder of the forward main gun. In 1949, he transferred from the People's Liberation Army infantry to the navy. When Lin Baoguo was still a boy, he was a young militiaman in the village. At that time, he carried a homemade gun wrapped in red silk and patrolled the mountains. When he was a few years older, he secretly joined the army and fought all the way from Shandong to Jiangnan. In August 1949, their machine gun company was transferred to the navy. In October, Lin Baoguo came to the warship. He came to the warship, looked at this, looked at that, and that night, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep. He climbed out of the bunkroom, looked at the vast ocean and the lights of the distant city, and listened to the roar of the waves. In the peaceful days on the warship, Lin Baoguo often touched the breech of the cannon, or looked at the anti-aircraft guns, looked at the weapons on the warship, thought about the past homemade guns, and then thought about the future, and grinned secretly at the ocean. He didn't know how many times he had secretly smiled.
    I was sitting on the deck chatting with Lin Baoguo when a tall, thin young man came down from the command platform. His name was Chen Renshan, and he was the deputy captain of this warship. Chen Renshan had a pair of binoculars hanging on his chest. He nodded and smiled at us and said, "What are you talking about!"
    I said: "Just chatting, please sit down!"
    Chen Renshan took off the binoculars from his chest and handed them to me, saying, "Look at how beautiful our country is."
    Indeed, looking at our motherland's land and sea through binoculars, there is a feeling of pride in our beautiful country that cannot be expressed. From Chen Renshan's mouth, I further understood the pride that a sailor feels for his glorious position.
    Chen Renshan is a talkative young man. He told me a lot of new knowledge. Chen Renshan asked me: "How long do you say our coastline is?" He gestured with his hand and said with a smile: "More than 11,000 kilometers." "More than 11,000 kilometers is more than 20,000 li!" He emphasized his tone. Our navy defends our motherland in these more than 20,000 li of waves.
    Chen Renshan pulled me to the command platform to take a good look at the coastline of our motherland through those larger binoculars. At this time, several warships sailed from the distant sea, and speedboats sailed back and forth on the nearby sea. Chen Renshan rotated the large binoculars on the command platform and asked: "When do you say our sailors are happiest?" He pointed to the several warships in the distant sea: "It's when our own warships are sailing in the sea. At that time, the sailors are standing at their battle stations, the waves of the sea are rolling under our feet, the red flag on the warship sets off the blue sky and the dark green sea, the air force is flying in the sky above the warship, the chimneys of the coastal cities are emitting thick smoke, the farmers are cultivating in the fields, and the fishermen are casting their nets in the sea. At this time, tell me, are you excited or not!" Chen Renshan smiled and patted my shoulder and said: "We naval people have the blessing of seeing and the blessing of eating! We can eat apples and pears from the north, and we can also eat oranges and bananas from the south. Have you been to our Taiwan? ... Taiwan is a good place. There are watermelons there all year round, and pineapples are also abundant, and there are bananas everywhere. Taiwan is our 'fruit country' and also our 'land of fish and rice'! Rice in Taiwan can be harvested three times a year. Not only that, but there are also large forests and rich mineral resources, and industry and transportation are very developed. How lovely Taiwan is! How can we allow this lovely territory of our motherland to be occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique for a long time, and become a military base for American aggressors, threatening the safety of our motherland."
    When I was walking on the deck, I often saw a young man climbing up and down the tall forward main mast like a monkey. The top of this forward main mast is at least three stories high from the sea, and it only takes him twelve seconds to climb the mast, up and down. This little sailor, when going down the ladder from the command platform, does not walk down step by step, but puts his legs on the ladder and slides down with a squeak. This little sailor is called Zhang Yongshun, and he is a signalman on the warship. Because the sailors like his bravery and agility, they call him "Little Tiger" because of his short, sturdy stature. Zhang Yongshun was originally a middle school student. When he was in school, the teacher had taught history countless times, telling how the imperialists had attacked China from this port and from that port. The imperialists brought endless pain and war to our Chinese people from the sea. Therefore, Zhang Yongshun was determined to become a sailor, hoping that one day the motherland would establish its own powerful navy to fight back against the imperialists who attacked us from the sea. When Zhang Yongshun signed up to join the army, he filled in three items in the volunteer column of his registration form: first, join the navy; second, join the navy; third, still join the navy. Zhang Yongshun was only fifteen years old at that time, and he was too short to get past the eye. The comrade in charge of the inspection said that he was not eighteen years old; he said that he was indeed eighteen years old. The inspecting comrade saw that his registration form said he was only fifteen years old; he said that in the Kuomintang era, he had underreported his age by three years out of fear of being drafted. After Zhang Yongshun arrived in the navy, he was very brave, often practicing climbing the highest forward main mast. The leadership saw that he was both brave and smart, so they made him a signalman.
    Zhang Yongshun knows that the five-star red flag is the symbol of the motherland, and it must be protected in any dangerous situation. Zhang Yongshun's monthly income is only a little over one hundred thousand yuan, but he bought so many books. Especially "How Steel Was Made," he bought a hardcover edition, and even wrapped the cover with a layer of paper. In fact, this is Zhang Yongshun's respect for Pavel. In Zhang Yongshun's mind, in addition to Pavel, there are also Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao..., the images of these heroes, I don't know how many times they slip through Zhang Yongshun's mind every day. Zhang Yongshun's understanding of his work is: to build a strong navy, one must be able to withstand the most severe tests, so he is not afraid of sea storms, but eager for the arrival of storms, and then to overcome the storms.
    In August of this year, when the fleet was cooperating with the air force in exercises, dark clouds suddenly appeared in the clear sky. The gale reached level ten or higher. The warships swayed in the heavy waves, and the main mast also swayed with the warships. Many sailors vomited and felt dizzy. When Zhang Yongshun was experiencing seasickness, the national flag was blown away from its normal position by the storm. No matter how tilted the main mast was, no matter how fierce the storm was, Zhang Yongshun had to climb up. Little Yongshun climbed to the top of the mast, but still could not reach the national flag that had been blown away from its normal position. He grabbed the horizontal plank at the top of the mast with one hand, his body suspended in the storm in the air. It took him a long time to grab the flag rope and pull the national flag back to its original position. Zhang Yongshun climbed down from the main mast nervously and excitedly, looked up at the bright five-star red flag, smiled, and returned to his combat post.

    三个水兵
    ——海军生活通讯之一
    本报记者　陈勇进
    在那炎热的八月底，我到了我们的海军基地。这时，水兵们除了紧张的实地演习之外，每天还进行一段时事学习。
    两点半钟，走廊下的更钟把兵舱里午睡的水兵敲醒了。接着就是嘟嘟的哨子声，那个值更的水兵一面吹着哨子一面喊着：学习了，学习了。兵舱里的电扇不管怎样长时间地旋转，通风机不管怎样把风送进去，还是热得透不过气来；所有的水兵都从兵舱里走上了甲板。在宽阔的甲板上，前主炮的水兵们把炮塔的阴影都占领了。他们在这大片片阴影里，一面乘凉，一面开讨论会。
    前主炮班的班长带着得意的笑容读着一篇文章，文章的内容，是描写河北省黑碯村在走上互助合作后的变化情形的。抗战前黑碯村二十六户人家只有七头牲口，山地每亩平均才产粮八十一斤。那时，除三家不买粮吃外，其余的都过着糠菜半年粮的生活；现在全村有六十七头牲口，还有四百八十只羊。从有了互助组、农业生产合作社后，平均每亩地产粮三百八十斤。全村二十六户中，现有的余粮够吃六年的四户，能吃四年的四户，其余的都能吃到二年。过去山岗岗上没有树木，今年一千多棵苹果树开始结果了，桃子的收入能顶一个麦收。班长念完这篇文章，稍停了停。这时有的水兵低着头像在想像着那美丽而富饶的黑碯村；有的把眼睛转向附近的岛屿，有的向着海洋的远处了望，像是要望尽万里波涛的海洋，有无敌人的踪影。海风徐徐地吹动着水兵脑后的帽带。
    “班长，这不是发展得太快了吗？”一个样儿有些俏皮的小伙子问。
    另一个面孔黑黑的水兵拍了下那个发问的小伙子的脑袋说：“发展的快了不好吗？你这家伙不好好学习，前几年国家还没军舰哩！你看看咱这一大片片军舰。我们的国家可不得了，我看，等不了十五年就到社会主义社会了。”这个发言的小伙子叫林保国，他那身干净的海军服，却没有掩盖住一个庄稼人的相貌。他说前些时他回家去看了一趟，村里的变化可真大，村子里过去没啥吃的户，现在都有吃有余了。
    这些水兵们，有的说他的平地变了，有的说他的山沟变了，有的说他的渔场变了，有的说他的城市变了。讲起自己祖国的变化来，那些水兵的话儿可实在多。这个讨论会，直到甲板上摆上了吃晚饭的摊摊后才停止了。其实他们一边吃着饭，一边还是谈论着这里变了，那里不认得了的。
    吃过晚饭，我在甲板上乘凉，又碰到那个结实的黑小伙林保国。他又问我北京建设得怎样？内地的庄稼怎样？问这问那，什么小事他都问到了。林保国说：“我们的祖国，没有海军可是不行。一九四九年到一九五○年，蒋介石的军舰还停在长江口封锁我们的上海。那时不仅我们海上的运输有困难，沿海的渔民也不能好好的生产。后来我们有了飞机有了海军，就把敌人的军舰从我们的领海上赶跑了。现在敌人的军舰不敢见我们海军的面了。”林保国是前主炮的标尺手。一九四九年他从人民解放军陆军里转到海军来。林保国还在少年的时候，就在村里当了个小民兵。那时，他扛的土枪上包着块红绸布，满山巡逻。他大了几岁就偷偷地参加了部队，一直从山东打到江南。一九四九年的八月，他们机炮连全部转到海军来了。十月间，林保国来到军舰上。他来到军舰上，看看这，看看那，当天的夜里，他兴奋得睡不着觉，从兵舱里爬出来，看看辽阔的海洋和远处城市的灯火，听听波涛的咆哮。林保国在军舰上的平静的日子里，经常摸摸大炮的炮拴，或看看高射炮，看看军舰上的武器，想想过去的土枪，再想想将来，就咧开嘴对着海洋偷偷地笑，他也不知偷笑过多少次。
    我正和林保国坐在甲板上闲唠，从指挥台上走下一个细高个子的青年人。他叫陈仁珊，是这艘军舰上的副舰长。陈仁珊胸前挂着一付望远镜，他点头向我们笑了笑说：“谈啥啦！”
    我说：“闲扯哩，请坐吧！”
    陈仁珊把他胸前的望远镜摘下来递给我说：“你看看我们的国家美不美。”
    确实，从望远镜里眺望我们祖国的陆地和海洋，真有说不出来的为自己美丽祖国而自豪的感觉。从陈仁珊的口里，我更加了解到一个海军为自己的光荣岗位而引起的自豪。
    陈仁珊是个健谈的青年，他告诉我很多新鲜的知识。陈仁珊问我：“你说我们的海岸线有多长？”他用手比了比笑着说：“一万一千多公里”。“一万一千多公里就是两万多华里呀！”他加重了自己的语气。我们的海军就在这两万多里的波涛里捍卫自己的祖国。
    陈仁珊拉我到指挥台上去，从那几个更大一些的望远镜里好好地看看自己祖国的海岸。这时，从遥远的海面上驶来几艘军舰，汽艇在附近海面上驶来驶去。陈仁珊把指挥台上的大望远镜旋转了一下问道：“你说，我们水兵最高兴的是什么时候？”他用手指了指那远处海洋的几艘军舰：“就是自己的军舰在大海里航行的时候。那时候呀，水兵站在自己的战位上，海的波涛在我们的脚下翻滚，军舰上的红旗衬着蓝天和深绿的海水，空军在军舰的上空飞翔，海岸的城市的烟囱冒着滚滚的浓烟，农民在田野里耕作，渔民在海里撒开了渔网，这时候你说你兴奋不兴奋吧！”陈仁珊笑着拍了我的肩膀一下说：“我们干海军的有眼福还有口福哩！我们能吃到北方的苹果和梨子，也能吃到南方的橘子和香蕉。你到过我们的台湾吗？……台湾可是个好地方，那里一年四季都有西瓜，那里还盛产凤梨，遍地都是香蕉。台湾是我们的‘水果之乡’，还是‘鱼米之乡’哩！台湾的稻子一年可产三季。不仅这些，那里还有大森林和丰富的矿产，工业交通都很发达。台湾是多么的可爱呵！我们怎样能让祖国这块可爱的领土，长期为蒋介石卖国集团所盘踞，成为美国侵略者的军事基地，威胁我们祖国的安全。”
    我在甲板上散步的时候，经常看到一个青年从高高的前主桅上像猴儿一样爬下来，又爬上去。这前主桅的桅顶，离海面至少像三层楼那样高，他爬桅的时间，上下才用十二秒钟。这个小水兵从指挥台下梯子的时候，不是一步一步地走下来，而是把两只腿往梯子上一蹻，吱地一下滑下来。这个小水兵叫张永顺，是军舰上的信号兵。因为水兵们喜欢他的勇敢和敏捷，就凭他那不高的、结实的个儿叫他“小老虎”。张永顺原是个中学的学生，他在学校里的时候，老师讲历史不知讲过多少次，帝国主义者从这个海港上进攻过中国，从那个海港上进攻过中国。帝国主义者从海上给我们中国人民送来了无尽的痛苦和战争。因此张永顺决心当个水兵，想望着祖国有一天建立起自己强大的海军把从海上进攻我们的帝国主义打回去。张永顺报名参军的时候，在他那张登记表的志愿栏里填了三条：第一参加海军，第二参加海军，第三还是参加海军。张永顺那时才十五岁，个儿矮得搪不过眼去。负责检查的同志说他没有十八岁；他说确实是十八岁了。检查的同志看他的登记表才十五岁；他说国民党时代怕抽壮丁少报了三岁。张永顺到了海军后，十分英勇，经常练习着爬那最高的前主桅。领导上看到他又勇敢又聪明，就叫他当了个信号兵。
    张永顺知道五星红旗就是祖国的象征，在任何险恶的情况下，都要把国旗保护好。张永顺每月的收入才十来万元，他却买了那么多的书。特别是“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，他买了精装本不说，封皮还用纸包了一层。其实，这就是张永顺对保尔的崇敬。张永顺的脑子里，除了保尔之外，还有黄继光、罗盛教……，这些英雄们的形象，每天不知要从张永顺的脑子里溜过多少次。张永顺对他自己工作的理解是：要建立一支强大的海军，就要经得起最严重的考验，因而他对海上的风暴不是害怕，而是渴望着风暴的到来，再去战胜风暴。
    今年的八月，舰队配合空军演习的时候，突然晴空里来了乌云。暴风刮到十级以上。军舰在大风浪里摇摆着，主桅也随着军舰摇摆着。很多水兵呕吐头晕。张永顺正在晕船的时候，国旗被暴风雨打得离开了正常的位置。张永顺不管主桅多么倾斜，不管暴风雨来得多么凶猛，他要爬上去。小永顺爬到桅顶上，还是够不着被刮到离开正常位置的国旗，他用一只手抓着桅顶的横板，身子悬在空中的暴风雨里，好久他才抓到了旗绳，把国旗拉到原来的位置上。张永顺紧张而兴奋地从主桅上爬下来，仰着头看了看那鲜明的五星红旗，笑着回到他的战斗岗位上。
