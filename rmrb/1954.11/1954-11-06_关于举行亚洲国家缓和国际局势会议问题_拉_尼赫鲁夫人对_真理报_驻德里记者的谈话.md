(Xinhua News Agency, November 5th) According to TASS Moscow, November 2nd: "Pravda" published a conversation between Madam Rameshwari Nehru, Chairman of the recently established Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian Countries Conference on Easing International Tensions, and a "Pravda" correspondent in Delhi. This Asian countries conference will exchange views on general issues of concern to Asian countries and study ways to ease international tensions and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Madam Rameshwari Nehru said: The decision to convene this peace-promoting conference was adopted based on the suggestions of representatives of various Asian countries at the Stockholm conference on easing international tensions, including representatives from India, China, the Soviet Union, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pakistan, Lebanon, Laos, and Cambodia.

A meeting of these Asian country delegations unanimously adopted a special resolution on convening the Asian countries conference.

Madam Nehru said that, considering the desire of Asian country representatives for the conference to be held in India, the Indian Preparatory Committee proposed holding the conference in Delhi.

Speaking about the purpose of the conference, Madam Rameshwari Nehru said: "This conference will promote closer ties and mutual understanding among the peoples of Asian countries and will facilitate their joint action in the struggle against the threat of war. The people of Asia do not want war. We want to create a peaceful atmosphere and support the idea of resolving conflicts through negotiation. War should be prohibited."

Madam Nehru said: "The conference should discuss political issues such as colonialism and foreign interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries, the issue of the People's Republic of China obtaining its rightful seat in the United Nations, and the prohibition and supervision of weapons of mass destruction." She particularly emphasized that Asian countries should protest against the use of military treaties such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to divide Asia. She said: "We do not want any foreign interference in our affairs through military aid—as in the case of Pakistan—or in any other way."

Madam Nehru also said that the United Nations cannot achieve its goals if a large country like China is excluded from it.

The conference agenda should also include issues such as expanding economic cooperation among Asian countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and strengthening cultural ties among the peoples of Asian countries.

Madam Nehru continued: "We invite all Asian countries to participate in the conference, regardless of their political systems. Invitations have been sent to Japan, China, the Asian republics of the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Burma, Indonesia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, and other countries. The committee has received letters from some prominent activists in Japan, China, Ceylon, and Burma, who support the conference. In Japan, a preparatory committee representing various political viewpoints has been formed."

Madam Nehru then emphasized: "We hope that this conference will have as broad a base and as great a representation as possible. Participants in the conference should be influential figures from various parties. We hope that experts in economics, science, culture, and the arts, social workers, and other figures will participate in the conference."

Madam Nehru concluded by expressing her great hopes for the conference, believing that it will strengthen friendly ties and mutual understanding among Asian countries and expand cooperation, thereby better safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    关于举行亚洲国家缓和国际局势会议问题
    ——拉·尼赫鲁夫人对“真理报”驻德里记者的谈话
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：“真理报”刊载了最近成立的亚洲国家缓和国际紧张局势会议印度筹备委员会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人接见“真理报”驻德里记者的谈话。这个亚洲国家会议将就亚洲各国所关心的一般性的问题交换意见，并研究缓和国际紧张局势和维护亚洲及世界和平的途径。
    拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人说：召开这次有益于和平的会议的决定，是在讨论缓和国际紧张局势的斯德哥尔摩会议上根据各个亚洲国家代表的建议通过的，这里面包括印度、中国、苏联、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、巴基斯坦、黎巴嫩、老挝和柬埔寨的代表。
    这些亚洲国家代表团举行的一次会议一致通过了一项关于召开这个亚洲国家会议的特别决议。
    尼赫鲁夫人说，考虑到亚洲国家代表都希望这次会议在印度举行，所以印度筹备委员会建议这次会议在德里举行。
    谈到这次会议的目的时，拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人说：“这次会议将促进亚洲各国人民的接近和互相了解，并将促成他们在反对战争威胁的斗争中共同行动。亚洲人民不要战争。我们要造成和平的气氛，要支持以协商办法解决互相冲突的思想。战争应该加以禁止。”
    尼赫鲁夫人说：“会议应当讨论像殖民主义和外国干涉亚洲国家内政这样的政治问题，中华人民共和国在联合国中取得它应得的席位的问题，以及禁止和监督大规模毁灭性武器的问题。”她特别着重指出，亚洲各国应当抗议利用像东南亚条约这样的军事条约来分裂亚洲的作法。她说：“我们不愿外国用军事援助——像巴基斯坦的情形那样——或任何其他方式对我国事务进行任何干涉。”
    尼赫鲁夫人还说：如果把中国那样的大国排除在联合国之外，联合国是不可能实现它的目标的。
    会议议程中也应当包括像在平等互利基础上扩大亚洲国家之间的经济合作之类的问题和加强亚洲各国人民之间的文化联系的问题。
    尼赫鲁夫人接着说：“我们邀请所有的亚洲国家参加会议，不管它们的政治制度如何。请柬已向日本、中国、苏联的亚洲各共和国、锡兰、缅甸、印度尼西亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、黎巴嫩及其他国家发出。委员会已收到了日本、中国、锡兰和缅甸的一些卓越活动家的来信，他们支持这个会议。在日本，已组成了一个代表各种政治观点的筹备委员会。”
    尼赫鲁夫人接着着重指出：“我们希望，这次会议有尽可能广泛的基础和尽可能大的代表性。会议的参加者应当是属于各种党派的有影响的人物。我们希望，参加会议的有经济、科学、文化、艺术各部门的专家，有社会工作者以及其他人物。”
    尼赫鲁夫人最后表示她对会议抱有很大的希望，相信会议将会加强亚洲各国的友好联系和互相谅解并扩大合作，使亚洲和世界和平得到更好的保障。
