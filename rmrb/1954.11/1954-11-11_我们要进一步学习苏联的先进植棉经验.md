    We must further learn from the advanced cotton planting experience of the Soviet Union
    Wu Chun'an, Head of Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province
    Xiliang Village is a very good cotton-producing area. I have been planting cotton since I was a child. In the old society, because of the shackles of the conservative idea that "it is difficult to harvest a hundred stones of grain without planting a hundred acres of land," the cotton production in Xiliang Village has never broken through the old "three guarantees" yield (about 30-odd jin of lint per mu). After liberation, we made a great determination to increase cotton production, but because of low technology, the yield was always difficult to increase. In 1951, I learned from the advanced Soviet experience of close planting, and the cotton seedlings per mu increased from 1,600 to more than 4,000, and the seed cotton yield increased to 278 jin. In 1952, I saw pictures of Soviet cotton bumper harvests, and visited Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting expert. Combined with the local situation, I more scientifically improved cotton cultivation techniques. Such as selecting excellent varieties, applying fertilizer reasonably in stages, setting seedlings three times, removing flower buds twice, and watering rationally, frequently, shallowly, and in alternate rows, and using shallow hoeing at both ends and deep hoeing in the middle when cultivating. As a result, five mu of high-yield land produced 1,021 jin of seed cotton per mu, creating a new national record for high-yield cotton production. The advanced Soviet cotton planting experience has been widely used in Xiliang Village for several years, making the village's cotton production exceed that of neighboring villages by 60 to 150 percent every year. In order to support the country's industrial construction, we have sold more than 310,000 jin of cotton to the state in the past three years.
    However, our farmers' acceptance of advanced experience is not very smooth. For example, Sun Qiyun, a 64-year-old man, said at the beginning: "Wu Chun'an is messing around! There is no trick to planting cotton. As long as there is enough manure, the yield can be increased." Therefore, when sowing, he used 130 jin of unfermented cottonseed cake per mu, mixed with dry cotton seeds that had not been soaked, and planted them. As a result, the manure burned the cotton seeds, and even the seedlings did not emerge completely. In order to widely disseminate the Soviet experience, we have continuously used chain demonstrations and other methods to teach the surrounding farmers. Every year, four to five thousand people receive the teaching.
    In October, when I visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing, I saw that Soviet cotton fields could produce more than 2,000 jin per mu, while ours could only produce more than 1,000 jin, which is a big difference. After research, we found that we still have many shortcomings. For example, we removed the small cotton bolls near the main stem of the cotton plant, thinking that they produced little and were useless. This is the opposite of what the Soviets did. Our pruning is also not timely enough. We must correct these shortcomings next year, further learn from the advanced Soviet science and technology, increase cotton production, and support the country's industrial construction.

    我们要进一步学习苏联的先进植棉经验
    山西翼城县西梁村农业生产合作社社长  吴春安
    西梁村是一个很好的产棉区，我从小就种棉。在旧社会里，因为受了“不种百亩田，难收百石粮”的保守思想的束缚，西梁村的棉花一直没有突破老三包的产量（每亩约产皮棉三十多斤）。解放后，我们下了很大决心，要提高棉花产量，但由于技术低，产量总是提不高。一九五一年，我学习了苏联先进的密植经验，每亩棉苗由一千六百株增植到四千多株，籽棉产量随着提高到二百七十八斤。一九五二年，我看到了苏联棉花丰产的画片，又访问了植棉能手曲耀离，结合本地情况，更科学地改进了棉花培植技术。像选用优良品种、分次合理施肥、三次定苗、两次脱花裤，合理地勤浇、浅浇、隔行浇，中耕时采用两头浅锄、中间深锄等办法。结果有五亩丰产地，每亩产籽棉一千零二十一斤，创造了全国棉花高额丰产新纪录。苏联的先进植棉经验，几年来已在西梁村普遍使用，使村内棉花产量每年都超过邻村百分之六十到一百五十以上。为了支援祖国工业建设，三年来我们共已卖给国家三十
  一万多斤棉花。
    但是，我们农民对于先进经验的接受并不是很顺当的，如六十四岁的孙其云老汉当初就说：“吴春安是瞎闹哩！种棉花没啥窍门，只要粪多，产量就能提高。”因此，他在播种时，每亩地使用了一百三十斤没有发酵的棉饼，和没有浸过的干棉籽拌在一起种下去，结果让粪烧坏了棉籽，连苗都没有出全。我们为了广泛传播苏联经验，曾不断采用连环示范等方式向周围农民传授，每年受到传授的群众都有四、五千人。
    十月间，在北京参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会时，我看到苏联棉田每亩能产两千多斤，而我们的只能产一千多斤，相差很远。经过研究，发现我们还有很多缺点，像靠近棉株主干的小棉桃我们就都打掉了，认为产量少，要它没用。这同苏联的做法正相反。我们整枝也还不够及时。这些缺点，我们明年一定要改掉，进一步学习苏联先进的科学技术，提高棉花产量，支援国家工业建设。
