In order to vigorously organize the supply of industrial products to the countryside and meet the needs of farmers, the Tianjin and Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Stations of the China National Department Store jointly organized a trade delegation to carry over 1,900 kinds of seasonal commodities to Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, to promote sales.

The trade delegation held a commodity exhibition in Changzhi starting from November 4th. Through the local government, they invited more than 100 representatives from over 90 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives from Ping順 (Píngshùn), Huguan, Changzi, Wuxiang, and Lucheng counties to attend the exhibition and make purchases. The local department store also supplemented the exhibition with some varieties. From the 4th to the 7th, in just four days, supply and marketing cooperatives from various places selected and purchased more than 500 kinds of commodities, with a total transaction value of 5.917 billion yuan.

At the close of the exhibition, the trade delegation held a discussion with representatives from various grassroots cooperatives. The representatives put forward suggestions for improvement regarding the style and color of绒衣 (róngyī, woolen sweaters/undershirts), and the packaging of biscuits and candies.
