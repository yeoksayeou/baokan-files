    Impressions of Visits to China by Foreign Friends Invited to Visit China

    India-China Friendship Association Delegation
    The delegation of the India-China Friendship Association, led by its head, Mrs. Uma Nehru, left Guangzhou for home via Hong Kong on the 2nd. Mrs. Anasuyya Gyan Chand, a member of the Indian Women's Delegation, also left Guangzhou for home at the same time.
    Before leaving, the delegation issued a written statement, the full text of which is as follows:
    On the eve of our departure from China, the members of our India-China Friendship Association delegation would like to express our warmest and most sincere gratitude for the cordial hospitality we have received from the Chinese people, and in particular to thank the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for inviting us. We know that the hospitality shown to us by the Chinese people is in fact a demonstration to all the people of India, and this hospitality will be the most precious memory of this visit. Our delegation will be happy to convey the great expressions of love and friendship of the Chinese people to all the peoples of our country.
    The friendship between the Indian and Chinese people dates back to ancient times; but today, when some are trying to create divisions between Asian countries, we are pleased and proud to find that the bonds of friendship between the Indian and Chinese peoples are constantly strengthening and providing a reliable basis for cooperation.
    We have been in your country for six weeks. We have visited your cities, villages, factories and mines. We have also visited your hospitals, schools, beautiful nurseries, religious temples, great educational and cultural institutions, and scenic spots and historical sites. We have also collectively and individually held talks and discussions with representatives of your mass organizations and people from all walks of life. At every stage, the itinerary was drawn up according to our wishes. People have patiently answered our specific questions. We would like to express our special gratitude for the thoughtfulness you have shown in arranging our travel plans and for the perfection with which you have taken care of the wishes of each member of our delegation.
    Our delegation was very impressed by the great achievements your country has accomplished in this short period of time. We know that this has been made possible because the Chinese people have creative enthusiasm and understanding, and they are united in building a new social order in their country.
    We know that both China and India need peace in order to complete the huge plans they have drawn up to realize the ideal of a happy and prosperous life for all their people. We are convinced that the Chinese government and people, like our government and people, are eager for peace. However, we know that the peace and security of the Asian people are in danger because some are trying to turn Asian countries into anti-peace strategies like the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    However, we believe that if the Five Principles announced by the Prime Ministers of India and China are widely accepted and cooperated with, they will greatly reduce the danger of war. The fact that India and China have adopted these principles as the basis of their international relations is a valuable contribution to the cause of peace. It will strengthen the forces of goodwill and friendship throughout the world, and make people fully recognize the fact that the legitimate position of the 600 million Chinese people, who are united in supporting their government, can no longer be denied in international institutions. Your Prime Minister's visit to our country, and our Prime Minister's visit to China this time, have been regarded by all peace-loving people everywhere as major events of great historical significance. We firmly believe that the mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of our two countries will pave the way for closer and better understanding between Asian countries in general, and especially between our two countries. The unity of the people of Asian countries is a necessary condition for peace in Asia.
    Finally, our delegation would like to once again express our warm thanks to our friends in the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and through them to the Chinese government and people, for making our six-week visit to China such a rich and enjoyable experience for all of us. We are convinced that the exchange of such friendly delegations can greatly promote understanding between our two countries, and this action should therefore be encouraged. We will do our best to strengthen and deepen the long-standing friendship between India and China, and create a broader basis for the greatest degree of understanding and cooperation between our two countries.
    General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 4th.
    The General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Mr. Tripathi, made the following observations in New Delhi on October 30 regarding his recent visit to China: The status of Chinese workers has been greatly improved. He pointed out: Many workers have been promoted to factory directors, and some of them are women.
    Tripathi said: People are deeply moved by the high level of support the current government receives. Because workers enjoy new prestige, it is generally not considered shameful to engage in manual labor. Free education is implemented at all levels of schools.
    Indian and Indonesian Journalists
    The Indian journalists, Swami Nathan of "Free Press," Bhatia of "Statesman," and the Central Executive Committee Member of the Indonesian Journalists Association, Sialilf Suleiman of Antara News Agency, Aman Nano of "Indonesian News," and Ke Xinmiao of "Java Post," who were invited to visit China by the All-China Journalists Association, have passed through Hong Kong on their way home. According to a report in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Swami Nathan and Suleiman and others made statements to the Hong Kong press on October 30 regarding their impressions of this visit to China.
    Swami Nathan said: "The Chinese people have a sincere desire to live in peace. We have not found the slightest sign of wanting war. They want peace in Asia so that they can complete their plans for the gradual development of the country."
    Swami Nathan said: "During our visit to China, we were able to go anywhere we wanted to go and talk to farmers and workers. We also visited the giant steel plant in Anshan and a shipyard in Dalian. We could enter freely everywhere, and I don't believe that anything like an 'Iron Curtain' exists in China."
    Swami Nathan also said: "The Chinese people we met were all proud of their country's achievements after liberation. They are very satisfied with the current government." He also said: "At the same time, we also saw the remarkable goodwill shown by the Chinese people towards India."
    Suleiman, Aman Nano, and Ke Xinmiao all spoke about the mechanization of Chinese mining and industrial equipment and the happy lives of the Chinese people. They said: What surprised us was the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for construction; everywhere we saw new houses being built, including hospitals, schools, factories, and houses. Ke Xinmiao also said: "Before we came, we did not understand the new China, and even thought that the Chinese people were being oppressed by the Communist Party. In the past month or so, we have seen smiling faces everywhere."
    Head of the Japanese Women's Delegation
    The head of the Japanese Women's Delegation, member of the Japanese House of Representatives, commentator, and president of the Japanese "Women's Times," Ichiko Kamichika, told reporters from Hong Kong newspapers before returning home via Hong Kong, praising the achievements of the Chinese people in construction and the happy lives of Chinese women and children. Ichiko Kamichika said: "Before we came to China, we had heard many reports about the construction there, and at that time we all thought that these were unbelievable miracles and fairy tales. But after visiting China this time, we found that these miracles are all true facts." She said: "The Chinese people, especially women, who are carrying out socialist construction, hope that all countries in the world will coexist peacefully. We feel that this wish is sincere. They said that peace is necessary for the happiness of mothers and children. This is precisely our common wish. We all have children and have tasted the pain of war. We know that there is no happiness without peace."
    Regarding the lives of Chinese women and children, Ichiko Kamichika said: "Chinese women have the same status as men; Chinese children receive very comprehensive care." She also told reporters: "Japanese women hope to establish good friendship with Chinese women. In the past, our connections were severed, but now they have begun to recover. Japanese women have gradually deepened their concern for the situation in China." (Xinhua News Agency)

    应邀访问我国的外国朋友们发表访华观感
    印中友协访华代表团
    印中友好协会访华代表团在团长乌玛·尼赫鲁夫人率领下，二日离广州经香港回国。印度妇女代表团团员阿纳苏雅·吉安·昌德夫人也在同时离广州回国。
    行前，代表团发表了书面声明，声明全文如下：
    我们印中友好协会代表团的团员们在我们离开中国的前夕，愿意对我们受到中国人民的殷勤款待表示我们最热忱和衷心的谢意，并且特别感谢邀请我们的中印友好协会和中国人民对外文化协会。我们知道，中国人民对我们表示的盛情实际上是对全体印度人民表示的，这种盛情将成为我们这次访问的最珍贵的回忆。我们的代表团将乐于把中国人民的友爱和友谊的伟大表示传达给我国的各族人民。
    印度人民和中国人民间的友谊可以追溯到很早的古代；但是在今天，当有人正企图在亚洲国家间制造分裂的时候，使我们感到高兴和骄傲的是：发现印中两国人民间的友谊联系正在不断加强，并为进行合作提供了可靠的基础。
    我们在贵国已有六星期了。我们曾参观了你们的城市、乡村、工厂和矿山。我们也参观了你们的医院、学校、美丽的托儿所、宗教寺院、伟大的教育和文化机关以及名胜古迹。我们也曾集体地和个别地和你们的群众组织的代表们以及你们各界人民举行会谈和讨论。我们在每一阶段的旅行计划都是按照我们的希望拟订的。人们不厌其烦地答复了我们提出的具体问题。我们特别要对于你们在安排我们的旅行计划方面的体贴入微，以及你们照顾我们代表团每一位团员的愿望方面所作到的尽善尽美的程度，表示我们的感激。
    我们代表团对于贵国在这短时间中完成的伟大成就，得到了非常深刻的印象。我们知道，这一点之所以成为可能，乃是由于中国人民具有创造性的热情和了解，他们团结一致地正在他们的国家里建立一个新的社会秩序。
    我们知道，中国和印度都需要和平，以便完成它们为了实现它们全体人民过幸福繁荣的生活的理想而拟定的巨大计划。我们深信中国政府和人民同我们的政府和人民一样渴望和平。但是，我们知道，由于有人正在竭力想使亚洲国家变成像最近的东南亚公约那样的反和平的战略的工具，亚洲人民的和平和安全正处于危险中。
    然而我们相信，如果印度总理和中国总理所宣布的五项原则得到广泛的接受和合作的话，那将能大大减轻发生战争的危险。印度和中国已经把这些原则作为它们国际关系的基础这一事实，是对和平事业的一种很可贵的贡献。它将加强全世界具有诚意和友好态度的力量，并使人们完全承认这一事实：再也不能否定团结一致支持自己的政府的六亿中国人民在国际机构中的正当地位了。你们总理对我国的访问，以及我们总理这次对中国的访问，已被各地所有爱好和平的人们认为是具有重要历史意义的大事，我们深信我们两国总理的互相访问将为一般亚洲国家、特别是我们两国之间的更亲切和更好的谅解铺平道路。亚洲各国人民的团结，是亚洲和平的必要条件。
    最后，我们代表团愿意再度向中印友好协会和中国人民对外文化协会的朋友们表示热烈的感谢，并通过他们向中国政府和人民表示热烈的感谢，感谢他们使我们大家在访问中国的六星期中得到如此丰富而愉快的经验。我们确信互派这种友好代表团能大大促进我们两国之间的谅解，因此应当鼓励这种行动。我们将竭尽全力加强和加深印度和中国之间的悠久的友谊，并为我们两国之间的最大程度的谅解和合作创造一个更广泛的基础。
  　印度全国工会大会总书记
    印度全国工会大会总书记特里帕蒂十月三十日在新德里发表他最近到中国访问的观感说：中国工人的地位已经大大提高。他指出：已经有许多工人提升为厂长，有一些还是妇女。
    特里帕蒂说：人们因目前的政府受到高度的支持而深为感动。由于工人享有新的威信，因此普遍都不认为担任体力劳动有失身份。各级学校都实行免费教育。
    印度和印度尼西亚新闻记者
    应中国新闻工作者联谊会邀请到中国访问的印度记者、“自由新闻”的斯瓦米纳坦、“政治家报”的巴蒂亚，和印度尼西亚记者协会中央执行委员、安塔拉通讯社记者西阿里弗·苏莱曼、“印度尼西亚新闻”编辑阿曼南度、“爪哇邮报”记者柯新淼，已路过香港返国。据香港大公报报道，斯瓦米纳坦和苏莱曼等人十月三十日曾分别向香港报界发表了这次访问中国的观感。
    斯瓦米纳坦说：“中国人民有真诚的愿望要在和平中生活。我们没有发现丝毫想要战争的迹象。他们愿意亚洲有和平，使他们能够完成逐步发展国家的计划。”
    斯瓦米纳坦说：“我们这次访问中国，可以到任何我们想要去的地方去，并且和农民、工人谈了话。我们也参观了鞍山的巨型钢铁厂和大连的一座造船厂。各处我们都可自由进入，我不相信有像‘铁幕’那样的东西存在于中国。”
    斯瓦米纳坦并说：“我们所遇见的中国人，个个都将解放后他们国家的成就引以为傲。他们对于现在的政府是十分满意的。”他又说：“我们同时又看到了中国人民对于印度所表现的了不起的好意。”
    苏莱曼、阿曼南度和柯新淼都谈到中国工矿的机械化设备和中国人民的愉快生活。他们说：使我们惊异的是中国人民那种建设的热忱；到处都看见新屋子在建立起来，其中有医院、学校、工厂，也有住宅。柯新淼并说：“我们未来之前，是不了解新中国的，甚至还以为中国人民受着共产党的压迫。在过去的一个多月中，我们却到处都看见一张张欢笑的脸。”
    日本妇女代表团团长
    日本妇女代表团团长、日本众议院议员、评论家、日本“妇女时报”社社长神近市子在途经香港回国前，曾向香港报纸记者发表谈话，称赞中国人民建设事业的成就和中国妇女、儿童的幸福生活。神近市子说：“在我们未到中国以前，就听说过许多关于那里建设的情况，那时我们都以为这是难以相信的奇迹和神仙故事而已。但是这次到中国访问以后，我们发现这些奇迹都是真正的事实。”她说：“正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民，特别是妇女们，是希望世界各国和平共处的。我们觉得这种愿望是真诚的。她们说，为了母亲和儿童的幸福，和平是必需的。这正是我们的共同愿望。我们也都有儿女，也尝过战争的痛苦，我们知道没有和平就没有幸福。”
    神近市子谈到中国妇女和儿童的生活说：“中国的妇女有和男子完全同样的地位；中国的儿童受到很周全的照顾。”她还告诉记者说：“日本妇女是希望和中国妇女建立良好友谊的。过去我们之间被割断了联系，而现在已经开始恢复了。日本的妇女已逐渐加深她们对中国情况的关怀。”  （据新华社讯）
