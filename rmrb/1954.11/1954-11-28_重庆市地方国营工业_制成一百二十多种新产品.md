    Chongqing Local State-Owned Industries
    Produce More Than 120 New Products

    Chongqing's local industries have successfully trial-produced more than 120 new varieties, new specifications, and new designs of products this year.

    After the Chongqing Gallic Acid Plastics Factory successfully trial-produced phenol-furfural plastic, it is now able to produce delicate products such as light switches and lamp holders, which could not be produced in the past. This factory is also using penta-gallic acid plastic to trial-produce axle bushes for spinning machines, accessories for machine tool wire connectors, and nozzles for fire extinguishers. The Chongqing Machine Iron Factory has successfully trial-produced two types of hydraulic pumps for rural irrigation this year. The Chinese-style fleece shirts and trousers produced by the Chongqing Cotton Weaving Factory this year are very popular among farmers. Now, this factory has temporarily stopped the production of ball shirts and is specializing in producing a batch of Chinese-style fleece shirts and trousers to supply the farmers. The Chongqing Enamel Factory has started manufacturing various spray-painted washbasins and cups this year. The Chongqing Water Pipe Parts Factory has trial-produced various specifications of "valves" using cast iron instead of copper, saving the state 68 tons of mixed copper this year.
