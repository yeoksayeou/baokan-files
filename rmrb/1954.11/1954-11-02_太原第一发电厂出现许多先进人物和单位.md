Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st: Many advanced individuals and advanced units in increasing production and practicing economy have emerged at the newly built Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant. In mid-October, the plant held its third quarterly representative meeting of advanced producers. After evaluation, thirty-one advanced groups, thirteen shifts, one construction team, one functional department, two construction sites, and ninety-one advanced individuals were awarded, including more than seven hundred workers, engineering technicians, and construction management personnel. All advanced units and many advanced individuals formulated new plans for increasing production and practicing economy at the meeting, enthusiastically proposing to compete with each other to ensure the completion of the plant construction task and continue to overcome waste.

The exemplary deeds of advanced producers in increasing production and practicing economy are encouraging all employees to move forward. After the large-scale installation of the boiler installation site’s water-cooled wall shift began, it created and improved 22 construction tools and operating methods, and implemented 16 important suggestions from Soviet experts. As a result, it exceeded the construction task every month and never had a single personal or equipment accident, saving the country 120 million yuan in labor and material costs. Model shift leader and veteran worker Qin Qichang has consistently demonstrated a high sense of responsibility to national construction in his daily work and life. One night in August, a torrential rain suddenly fell on the construction site. Qin Qichang woke up from his sleep and immediately led several workers to the construction site in the rain, covering the cable trenches, which are most afraid of rain, with rainproof equipment, thus ensuring the quality of the project. Technician and cable shift leader Liu Zhenhan recently redesigned a new line when he was responsible for installing the cable from the substation to the main plant building, shortening the line distance. The adoption of this suggestion alone saved cables worth 170 million yuan. This cable shift saved cables and other materials worth more than 800 million yuan in the third quarter. In addition, purchasing agent Liu Xingru insisted on working for several days and nights, strengthening contact with the Taiyuan Brick Factory and supervising transportation work, and timely transported 3.2 million bricks urgently needed for the project to the construction site. He also went deep into the construction site and learned that the timber procurement plan was impractical, and took the initiative to propose reducing the amount of timber procurement, so that 420 million yuan of funds would not be tied up.

    太原第一发电厂出现许多先进人物和单位
    据新华社太原一日电：新建太原第一发电厂出现许多增产节约的先进人物和先进单位。十月中旬，全厂召开第三季度先进生产者代表大会，经过评选并获得奖励的有三十一个先进小组、十三个班、一个施工队、一个职能科、两个工地和九十一个先进人物，共包括工人、工程技术人员和施工管理人员等七百多人。各个先进单位和许多先进人物都在会上制订出了新的增产节约计划，热烈提出要相互竞赛，保证完成建厂任务和继续克服浪费现象。
    先进生产者的增产节约的模范事迹，正在鼓舞着全体职工前进。锅炉安装工地水冷壁班在大规模安装工程开始后，先后创造、改进施工工具和操作方法二十二件，贯彻执行苏联专家重要建议十六条，因而月月超额完成施工任务，从未发生过一次人身和设备事故，为国家节约工料费一亿二千多万元。模范班长、老工人秦其昌在日常工作和生活中一贯表现了对国家建设的高度负责精神。八月的一天深夜，工地上突然下起倾盆大雨，秦其昌从睡梦中惊醒后，立刻带领几个工人冒雨赶到工地，把最怕雨水的电缆沟等用防雨器材盖好，因而保证了工程质量。技术员兼电缆班班长刘振汉最近在负责安装从变电室通往主厂房的电缆时，重新设计了一条新的线路，缩短了线路距离，只此一项建议经领导采纳后就节省电缆价值一亿七千多万元。这个电缆班在第三季中共节约了价值八亿多元的电缆和其他材料。另外，采购员柳星如连续几个昼夜坚持工作，加强同太原市砖厂的联系和监督运输工作，将工程急需的三百二十万块砖及时运到工地。他并深入工地，了解到木材采购计划不切实际，主动提出削减木材采购量，使得四亿二千万元的资金不致积压起来。
