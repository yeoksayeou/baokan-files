Hubei Province Farmers Sell Surplus Grain to Support Disaster Area People's Production
Inner Mongolia's Various Ethnic Groups of Farmers Enthusiastically Pay Agricultural Tax and Sell Surplus Grain

[By Our Newspaper] The grain unified purchase work in Hubei Province has been fully launched, and the broad masses of farmers are actively selling surplus grain to the state. As of October 31, the surplus grain sold by farmers in various regions to the state has reached more than 50 percent of the province's grain unified purchase task. Farmers in Jinjiangkou in Changyang County, Longzhong in Xiangyang County, and Songqiang in Huanggang County, among other townships, have sold more surplus grain than the state's original unified purchase plan. The Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qichun County specially selected 30,000 jin of high-quality "Victory Xian" rice, dried and winnowed it, and sold it to the state to support farmers' production in disaster areas.

Farmers in Hubei Province have a deep understanding of the benefits of the grain unified purchase and supply system over the past year. Xu Yougong, a poor peasant in Lidian Township, Xishui County, found his family in difficulty because of their poverty. Although he received land during the land reform, his life was still relatively difficult. Last autumn, he even planned to sell more than one mu of land to repay debts. After the implementation of the grain unified purchase in Lidian Township, a credit cooperative was established. Xu Yougong could borrow money from the credit cooperative if he needed it, and the state supplied him with grain when he lacked it. This year, grain production increased, and he sold 800 jin of grain to the state in advance, repaid the money to the credit cooperative, and now he has sold another 200 jin of surplus grain to the state, and is actively mobilizing others to sell surplus grain. Zhao Youyuan, a middle peasant in Gunshan Township, Sui County, hid 240 jin of surplus grain last year because he was afraid of showing off his wealth, which resulted in the grain becoming moldy. During the summer grain purchase this year, he listened to the township cadres and sold 400 jin of surplus grain and used the money from the grain sale to buy fertilizer and agricultural tools, which resulted in an increase of seventeen shi of rice in the autumn. He therefore realized that selling surplus grain was turning "dead grain into live money," which was both patriotic and increased production. Now he has sold another 1,800 jin of surplus grain.

At present, the first batch of townships in the province have largely completed the grain unified purchase work, and farmers are actively engaged in winter production. The grain unified purchase work in the second batch of townships is underway.

[By Our Newspaper] Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are enthusiastically paying agricultural tax and selling surplus grain to the state. As of November 10, approximately 400,000 jin of public grain and surplus grain have been stored throughout the province.

From mid-October to early November, most counties and banners in the region held three-level cadre meetings to summarize the grain requisition and purchase work of the previous year, formulate this year's grain requisition and purchase plan, and conscientiously study the policies for levying agricultural taxes and implementing the grain unified purchase and supply system. After the cadres' propaganda and education, the broad masses of farmers realized that actively paying agricultural tax and selling surplus grain is a glorious act to support the country's socialist industrialization, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the people in disaster areas, and their enthusiasm for selling and paying grain is very high. In many places, the amount of surplus grain reported by farmers for sale exceeded the state's original purchase plan. In the famous granary area of Inner Mongolia – the Hetao Administrative Region, the numbers of grain sales reported by farmers in Wuyuan, Linhe and other counties exceeded the state plan by one million to six million jin. When delivering grain, many places organized collective transportation by agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, or natural villages, saving manpower and shortening the time for grain delivery. Naiman Sumu Township in Dalad Banner also formulated a covenant, proposing "No bad grain leaves the village, no bad carts load grain, no inferior livestock pull carts," to ensure the safe storage of grain.

    湖北省农民出卖余粮支援灾区人民生产
    内蒙古各族农民踊跃缴纳公粮出卖余粮
    【本报讯】湖北省粮食统购工作已经全面展开，广大农民积极把余粮卖给国家。截至十月三十一日止，各地农民卖给国家的余粮，已达全省粮食统购任务的百分之五十以上。长阳县津阳口、襄阳县隆中、黄冈县宋墙等乡农民卖出的余粮，都超过了国家原定的统购计划。蕲春县新民农业生产合作社特别选出三万斤“胜利籼”良种稻谷，晒干扬净卖给国家，支持灾区农民生产。
    湖北省农民对一年来粮食统购统销的好处有深切的体会。浠水县里店乡贫农徐有功因为家里底子空，虽然土地改革时分到了田地，生活还比较困难，去年秋天他还曾经打算卖一亩多田还债。里店乡实行粮食统购以后，成立了信用合作社。徐有功缺钱，可以从信用合作社借到；缺粮食，有国家供应。今年粮食增产了，他提前卖给国家八百斤粮食，还了信用合作社的钱，现在又卖给国家二百斤余粮，并且积极动员别人卖余粮。随县磙山乡中农赵友远去年因为怕露富，藏了二百四十斤余粮没有卖，结果这批粮食发了霉。今年夏季统购粮食的时候，他听了乡干部的话，卖了四百斤余粮，并且用卖粮得到的钱买了肥料和农具，结果到秋天增产了十七石稻谷。他因此体会到卖余粮是把“死粮变活钱”，既爱国，又能增产。现在他又卖出了一千八百斤余粮。
    目前，全省第一批乡的粮食统购工作已经大体结束，农民正在积极进行冬季生产。第二批乡的粮食统购工作正在进行中。
    【本报讯】内蒙古自治区各族农民踊跃向国家缴纳公粮，出售余粮。到十一月十日止，全省入库的公粮和余粮已经约有四十万斤。
    从十月中旬到十一月初，全区绝大部分县、旗都召开三级干部会议，总结了去年征粮购粮的工作，制定了今年征粮购粮的方案，并且认真学习了征收农业税的政策和实行粮食统购统销的政策。经过干部宣传教育后，广大农民认识到踊跃缴纳公粮和出卖余粮，是支援国家社会主义工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区人民的光荣行为，售粮和缴粮的热情很高。许多地方农民自报出售的余粮，超过了国家原来的收购计划。内蒙古著名的粮仓区——河套行政区五原、临河等县农民自报售粮的数字，超过国家计划一百万斤到六百万斤。在送粮时，许多地方以农业生产合作社、互助组或自然村为单位，组织集体运送，节省了人力，缩短了缴粮时间。达拉特后旗乃马召乡还订立公约，提出“坏粮不出村，坏车不装粮，劣畜不套车”，保证粮食安全入库。
