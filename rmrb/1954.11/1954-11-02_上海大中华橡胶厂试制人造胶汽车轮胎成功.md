Shanghai Great China Rubber Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Artificial Rubber Car Tires.

    This artificial rubber tire is made from artificial mixed rubber produced using raw materials such as natural gas, calcium carbide, and alcohol. In the process of trial-producing artificial rubber car tires, the factory carried out more than 200 improvements and experiments. After the factory initially succeeded in the trial production in March of this year, it produced six artificial rubber tires. These six tires have been test-driven for several months by the Hangzhou Transportation Company. Except for two tires that had some manufacturing defects and were repaired after being subjected to hard impacts, the remaining four tires have traveled approximately 25,000 kilometers. The successful trial production and mass production of this artificial rubber tire will save the country foreign exchange and further meet the needs of the country's developing transportation industry. At present, the factory is using artificial rubber to trial-produce the cord fabric layer inside the tires, striving to produce car tires that do not use any natural rubber at all.

    上海大中华橡胶厂试制人造胶汽车轮胎成功
    上海大中华橡胶厂试制人造胶汽车轮胎成功。这种人造胶车胎，是利用天燃煤气、电石、酒精等原料制出的人造混合胶制成的。该厂在试制人造胶汽车胎的过程中，曾先后进行了二百多次的改进和试验。今年三月该厂初步试制成功后，就制出了六只人造胶车胎。这六只车胎已经杭州运输公司实地行驶了几个月，其中除有两只在制造技术上有些毛病和受硬伤经过修补外，其余四只都已行驶了二万五千公里左右的路程。这种人造胶车胎的试制成功和大量生产，将可给国家节省外汇，进一步满足国家发展运输事业的需要。目前该厂正利用人造胶试制车胎内的帘布层，争取制出完全不用天然橡胶的汽车轮胎。
