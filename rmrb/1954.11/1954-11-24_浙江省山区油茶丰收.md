    Zhejiang Province Mountainous Areas Achieve Bumper Oil-Tea Harvest
    The mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province, such as Quzhou and Wenzhou, have seen a comprehensive bumper harvest of oil-tea on over 300,000 mu of land. It is estimated that the total output of oil-tea seeds will increase by more than 7 million jin, an increase of about 30% compared to last year, exceeding the oil-tea production increase plan. Before liberation, due to farmers' inability to cultivate, large numbers of oil-tea gardens were abandoned, and oil-tea production declined year by year. After liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the People's Government, farmers strengthened the management of oil-tea gardens, and the yield increased year by year. Last winter and this spring, 60% of the oil-tea gardens in Changshan County were dug and cleared, promoting the vigorous growth of oil-tea trees. This year, the climate was mild and rainfall was abundant, resulting in full and plump oil-tea fruits with sufficient oil content. At present, farmers in various regions have completed the harvesting of oil-tea seeds and are actively selecting and drying them, preparing to sell the oil-tea seeds to the state in a timely manner to support industrial construction.
    In order to further develop oil-tea production, farmers in various regions will comprehensively carry out digging and clearing work this winter. A large number of seeds have also been selected for expanding the planting area and restoring the abandoned oil-tea gardens. (Our Zhejiang Reporter Station)

    浙江省山区油茶丰收
    浙江省衢州、温州等山区三十多万亩油茶获得全面丰收，估计共可增产油茶籽七百万斤以上，比去年增产三成左右，超额完成了油茶增产计划。解放前，由于农民无力培育，油茶园大批荒芜，油茶生产逐年萎缩；解放后在党和人民政府的大力扶植下，农民加强了油茶园的管理，产量逐年提高，去冬今春常山县有百分之六十的油茶园都进行了挖山、铲山工作，促进了油茶树的蓬勃生长。今年气候温和，雨水充足，各地油茶树结实饱满，含油量充足。现在，各地农民已完成了油茶籽的采收工作，正在积极拣、晒，准备及时把油茶籽卖给国家，支援工业建设。
    为了进一步发展油茶生产，各地农民将在今冬全面开展挖山、铲山工作。目前并已选留了大批种籽，以便扩大种植面积，恢复已经荒芜的油茶园。（本报浙江记者站）
