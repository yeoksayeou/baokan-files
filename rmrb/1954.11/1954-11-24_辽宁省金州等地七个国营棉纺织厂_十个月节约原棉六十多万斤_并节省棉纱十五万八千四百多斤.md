The seven state-owned cotton textile factories in Jinzhou, Wafangdian, Yingkou, Dalian, Liaoyang, Jinzhou, Shenyang, and other places in Liaoning Province have saved more than 628,000 jin of raw cotton and 158,400 jin of cotton yarn for the country from the beginning of this year to October. These savings of raw cotton and cotton yarn can be woven into more than 71,800 bolts of cotton cloth, which can provide 493,000 people with a set of clothes each.

In the process of saving raw cotton and cotton yarn, each factory has actively adopted various measures and methods. Dalian Textile Factory, Wafangdian Textile Factory, and Jinzhou Textile Factory, etc., reused 32-count short-staple cotton for the same count yarn on the basis of ensuring quality, and spun broken-seed cotton and relatively short fibers into 6-count and 10-count yarn, which increased the yarn output rate. Jinzhou Textile Factory improved the vertical cotton opener dust rod, reducing the cotton waste rate from 0.85 percent to 0.16 percent. Liaoyang Textile Factory installed collectors on some spinning frames to reduce the scattering of loose fibers in the yarn. Yingkou, Jinzhou, Shenyang, and Jinzhou Textile Factories have basically eliminated the phenomenon of white cotton being mixed into waste materials.

In terms of spinning, each factory has generally promoted systems such as "timed doffing" and "bobbin maintenance" to reduce the production of defective bobbins. Dalian Textile Factory carried out bobbin maintenance, reducing the broken waist yarn caused by collapsed bobbins and steel ring friction, and also reduced yarn breakage. The original output of bad yarn was more than 1,700 per shift, but now it has been reduced to about 200.

In addition, most factories have strengthened the management of raw cotton this year, and conducted tests on various raw cottons by origin, ensuring the improvement of quality and greatly reducing the yarn breakage rate.

Most cotton textile factories have formulated fourth-quarter savings plans. Now, the workers of each factory are taking different measures and striving to save more cotton yarn for the country.

    辽宁省金州等地七个国营棉纺织厂
    十个月节约原棉六十多万斤
    并节省棉纱十五万八千四百多斤
    辽宁省金州、瓦房店、营口、大连、辽阳、锦州、沈阳等地七个国营棉纺织厂，自从今年年初开始节约用棉、用纱以来，到十月份共给国家节省了原棉六十二万八千多斤，棉纱十五万八千四百多斤。用这些节省的原棉和棉纱，能够织成七万一千八百多匹棉布，可以供四十九万三千多人每人做一套衣服。
    在节约原棉和棉纱的过程中，各厂都积极地采取了各种措施和办法。大连纺织厂和瓦房店纺织厂、金州纺织厂等，在保证质量的基础上将三十二支抄斩花回用本支，把破籽棉和比较短的纤维纺织成六支纱和十支纱，提高了出纱率。锦州纺织厂改进了立式开棉机尘棒，落棉率由百分之零点八五降低到零点一六。辽阳纺织厂在部分细纱机上安装了集合器，减少了细纱游离纤维的散头。营口、锦州、沈阳和金州纺织厂都基本上消灭了白花混入下脚的现象。
    在细纱方面，各厂普遍推行了“定时落纱”和“木管检修”等制度，减少了坏管纱的产生。大连纺织厂进行了木管检修，减少了因崩管和钢领磨擦而造成的破腰坏纱，同时也减少了断头，原来每班出坏穗子一千七百多个，现在减少到二百个左右。
    另外，大部分厂今年都加强了原棉的管理，把各种原棉分产地进行试验，保证了质量的提高，使断头率大大的降低。
    各棉纺织厂大都制定了第四季度节约计划。现在各厂职工都采取了不同的措施，努力争取给国家节约更多的棉纱。
