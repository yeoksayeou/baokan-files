Sell More Surplus Grain to the State
    Li Ce, Zhang Guangpu

    Hexiang Township, Suining County, Sichuan Province, had a bumper harvest this year. Preliminary estimates indicate that grain production increased by 10% compared to last year.

    Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain last winter, the face of Hexiang Township has undergone tremendous changes. The farmers of the entire township have recognized that socialism is the only correct path. Even some farmers who were engaged in small businesses have given up their businesses and actively participated in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations. More than eighty mutual aid teams that were on the verge of collapse have reorganized their ranks, and the mutual aid teams in the township have merged into twenty-seven joint teams. The township's first agricultural production cooperative, the Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative, was established, and seven new cooperatives were established before the autumn harvest this year. More than 90% of the farmers in the township have been organized. The farmers' enthusiasm for production has also increased unprecedentedly. The township has built many weirs and reinforced river embankments, and has won the honorary title of a model township for drought resistance and water conservation in the county.

    This year's autumn harvest saw the Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative achieve a bumper harvest in its first year of establishment. Yellow rice increased by 26%, and the yield of sweet potatoes reached more than 2,000 jin per mu. The income of the cooperative members has increased unprecedentedly. Cooperative member Xiang Chengli said that his income this year increased by 12.5% compared to last year. He happily said: "Without participating in the production cooperative, where would so much income come from?" He hadn't raised a single pig in seventeen years, but this year he raised three fat pigs. He decided to sell 1,000 jin of yellow rice to the state. Cooperative member Yi Yinzhou used to be short of fertilizer and seeds every year. During the busy farming season, he had to borrow money to buy rice and vegetables to hire people to work. Last year, he was short of rice for three months, and the whole family only ate sweet potatoes. He said: "This year, after joining the cooperative, the situation is different. This is the benefit of the cooperative." He also decided to sell 1,000 jin of yellow rice to the state. All the cooperative members have made grain sales plans. After the harvest, the cooperative members were busy drying the grain and cleaning it, and they went to the grain purchasing station to sell it to the state. The cooperative members said: "The Communist Party taught us to establish production cooperatives, and the state has helped us increase production. We must actively support the country's industrial construction and sell all the surplus grain to the state."

    The grain sales plan of the Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative was published on the township's blackboard newspaper and introduced at the mutual aid and cooperation joint meeting. It spread throughout the township like a whirlwind. The seven new production cooperatives established this year proposed to learn from the old cooperative, the Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative. Those joint teams preparing to establish cooperatives have also made grain sales plans. Xia Haiqing, a township people's representative, saw the grain sales plan of the Tiantai Cooperative. The next day, he asked his wife and brothers to carry 1,300 jin of surplus grain to the purchasing station and sell it to the state. He also mobilized the joint team he led to sell the surplus grain within three or four days. Many farmers held family meetings to make plans to save grain and sell more grain. Farmer Shu Leyong had just harvested the rice, and the whole family stopped eating sweet potatoes. In this way, his family would eat more than eight dou of yellow rice every month. When discussing grain sales, the whole family decided to mix some sweet potatoes into each meal, which would save two dou of yellow rice every month. When farmer Song Zunian proposed a grain sales plan at home, his mother said: "Why sell so much? Is there enough grain left to eat?" Song Zunian compared the past and present: Before liberation, one year, he borrowed two loads of rice to buy fertilizer, and he had to return five loads after the autumn harvest. He also had to avoid the Kuomintang's conscription and ran around all year round, unable to produce, and the family life was very difficult. He said: "Look at how much better our life is today than before." This moved his mother, and she proposed that the whole family mix some sweet potatoes into each meal, saving two he of rice.

    Farmers no longer have to worry about grain price fluctuations and the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants. They realize that it is better to sell the rice piled up at home to the state and turn dead money into active money. However, some farmers are not clear about the relationship between improving their lives and supporting the country. When the members of the Tiantai Cooperative discussed the grain sales plan, member Ran Junli (a poor peasant with a family of three) harvested 3,000 jin of yellow rice, and he planned to sell only 500 jin. When the cooperative members criticized him, he said: "I have grain, and I want to improve my life first." Cooperative member Xue Lincheng said to him: "We should improve our lives, but we should improve them gradually. If we don't sell the surplus grain to the state, what will we use to support the country's industrial construction?" After Ran Junli left the meeting, he was still thinking: "Life must be improved, and industry must be built." After the cooperative members explained to him again and again, he finally understood: This year, he harvested so much grain because he joined the cooperative. In the future, he will use tractors to cultivate the land, and he will harvest more grain. He decided to sell 1,300 jin of yellow rice to the state. The middle peasant Wu Shixing had a different idea. His grain income increased by 54% this year compared to last year, making him the household with the highest income in the Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative. He thought that he had his own deposits in the state bank; he had everything he needed for farm tools and clothing; and his expenses for oil, salt and other miscellaneous items were not large. What was the use of selling more grain and depositing the money in the bank? In particular, he was worried about what would happen if the harvest was not good next year, and he wanted to sell less surplus grain. His grandson, Wu Zhongcheng, was a member of the Communist Youth League and repeatedly persuaded him. Later, he figured it out and said: "It is not right to only think about myself. Now the cooperative has cattle and fertilizer. The cadres are right, and production will increase next year. Why worry about a bad harvest next year?" Wu Shixing finally decided to sell all the surplus grain to the state and prepared to give the surplus money to the production cooperative as an investment to run the cooperative better. He said: "This is the capital for us farmers to build socialism."

    In addition to using the money from selling grain to repay government loans, buy cloth and add farm implements, more than 70% of the remaining money was deposited in the bank by the farmers, preparing to invest in production next year. In the grain sales, the farmers saw the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative. Members of twelve mutual aid teams are creating conditions for establishing cooperatives. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are buying fertilizer, livestock and farm tools in order to improve production, and they are repairing manure pits and preparing to accumulate a large amount of soil fertilizer to actively expand production.

    The farmers of Hexiang Township, in order to increase grain production and support the country's industrial construction, plunged into the upsurge of autumn plowing and autumn planting as soon as the autumn harvest ended. According to the state plan, the farmers in the township expanded the planting area of wheat and rapeseed by 13% compared to last year. Now, in the fields within a radius of ten miles, there are laboring crowds everywhere. On the slopes and in the fields, the farmers are busy shoveling the ground and planting seeds. The Tiantai Agricultural Production Cooperative mixed more than 300 jin of barley seeds with Ceresan powder and will soon sow them. The harvested paddy fields have been generally plowed twice and harrowed twice. The weeds on the field walls that have not withered are shoveled clean, and the field ridges are reinforced and rammed tightly with a layer of mud, so that thousands of acres of paddy fields along the mountain gullies are storing green autumn water.

    把更多的余粮卖给国家
    李策　张光普
    四川省遂宁县和赤乡今年丰收，初步估计今年粮食比去年增产百分之十。
    自从去年冬季国家实行粮食统购统销以来，和赤乡的面貌有了很大的变化。全乡农民认识了社会主义是唯一正确的道路，连有些兼做小生意的农民都撒手不干了，并且积极地参加了农业生产互助合作组织；几乎要垮台的八十多个互助组重新整顿了自己的队伍，全乡互助组又合并成二十七个联组；乡里的第一个农业生产合作社——天台农业生产社成立了，今年秋收前又建立了七个新社；全乡组织起来的农民已经达到百分之九十以上。农民的生产热情也空前提高，全乡修了很多堰塘和扎河堤，获得了全县抗旱保水模范乡的光荣称号。
    今年秋收，天台农业生产合作社在建立后的第一年就获得了丰收，黄谷增产百分之二十六，红苕每亩地的产量达到两千多斤。社员们的收入空前地增加了。社员向成立今年的收入比去年增加了百分之十二点五。他高兴地说：“不参加生产合作社，那来这么多收入。”他十七年来没喂过一口猪，今年却喂了三口肥猪。他决定卖一千斤黄谷给国家。社员易银洲过去年年都短肥料，少种籽；到了农忙季节，还得借钱买米买菜请人做活；去年还缺三个月的米，全家大小光吃红苕。他说：“今年入了社，光景就两样了，这是合作社的好处。”他也决定卖一千斤黄谷给国家。全体社员都订出了卖粮计划。收获以后，社员们就忙着晒干风净，纷纷挑到购粮站卖给国家。社员们说：“共产党教导我们成立了生产合作社，国家又扶助我们增加了生产，我们要积极支援国家工业建设，要把余粮全部卖给国家。”
    天台农业生产合作社的卖粮计划，在乡的黑板报上登载出来，又在互助合作联席会上作了介绍，一阵风似地就传遍了全乡。今年新建的七个生产合作社提出向老社——天台农业生产合作社看齐。那些准备建社的联组，也都纷纷订出卖粮计划。乡人民代表夏海青看到天台社卖粮计划，第二天，他就叫妻子和兄弟把一千三百斤余粮挑到收购站，卖给了国家；并动员他领导的联组在三四天内卖完了余粮。许多农民召开家庭会议，订出节约粮食多卖粮的办法。农民舒乐雍刚打下谷子，全家就不吃红苕了，这样，他家每月就要吃八斗多黄谷；讨论卖粮时，全家决定每顿饭掺些红苕，每月就能省下两斗黄谷。农民宋祖年在家中提出卖粮计划时，他妈说：“卖哪么多，剩下的粮食还够吃？”宋祖年就把过去和今天的生活比较一下：解放前有一年，他向别人借了两挑谷子买肥料，秋收后就要还五挑；他又要躲避国民党抓兵，整年东奔西走，不能生产，家庭生活非常困难。他说：“你看我们今天生活比以前好多少倍。”感动了他的妈妈，她提出了全家每顿饭掺些红苕，节省两合米。
    农民现在再也不用耽心粮价波动和奸商的剥削了，他们认识到谷子堆在家里不如卖给国家，把死财变成活财。可是有的农民对改善生活和支援国家的关系还弄不清楚。天台社的社员们讨论卖粮计划的时候，社员冉俊立（贫农，全家三口人）收了三千斤黄谷，他计划只能卖五百斤。社员们批评他时，他说：“自己有粮，想先改善一下生活”。社员薛林诚对他说：“我们生活是要改善的，可是应当逐步改善，咱们不把余粮卖给国家，还用什么支援国家工业建设。”冉俊立散会后，脑子里还是打转转：“生活要改善，工业也要建设。”经过社员再三对他解释，他才想透了：今年因为入了社才收这么多粮食，以后用拖拉机耕田，粮食会收的更多些。他决定卖给国家一千三百斤黄谷。中农吴世兴的想法又不同，他今年比去年增加粮食收入百分之五十四，是天台农业生产合作社收入最多的一户。他想，在国家银行有自己的存款；农具和吃穿样样都有；油盐等杂项开销也不大，多卖粮，把钱存到银行有啥用处。特别是顾虑到明年万一收成不好怎么办，想少卖点余粮。他的孙子吴忠诚是个青年团员，反复地劝他，后来他想通了，说：“光替自己想是不对的，现在社内牛也有了，肥料也有了，干部们的话没错，明年还要增产，还用耽心明年收成不好？”吴世兴最后决定把全部余粮卖给国家，并准备把多余的钱交给生产合作社作为投资，把社办得更好。他说：“这是我们农民建设社会主义的本钱。”
    卖粮农民们，除了把卖粮的钱还了政府贷款、买布和添置农具以外，余下的钱百分之七十以上存入银行，准备明年投入生产。在卖粮中农民们又看到农业生产合作社的优越性，有十二个互助组联组的组员们正在创造办社条件。许多农业生产合作社和互助组为把生产搞得更好，都纷纷购买肥料、牲畜和农具，并修理粪坑，准备大量积压土肥，积极扩大生产。
    和赤乡的农民，为着增产更多的粮食支援国家工业建设，秋收刚一结束，他们就又投入秋耕秋种的热潮中。全乡农民按照国家计划比去年扩大了小麦和油菜播种面积百分之十三。现在，在方圆十来里地的田野里，到处是劳动的人群。山坡上，田地里，农民们正忙着铲地下种。天台农业生产合作社用赛力散药粉拌好三百多斤大麦种籽，就快播种了。丰收过的稻田，已普遍翻犁了二犁二耙。田壁上的杂草没有枯萎的就铲得光光的，田坎加固捶紧糊上了一层泥，使沿着山沟的数千亩水田储着绿绿的秋水。
