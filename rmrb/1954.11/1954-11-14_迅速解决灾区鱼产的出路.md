　　Rapidly Resolve the Issue of Fish Products from Disaster Areas
    Editor: The masses in the disaster areas of Anhui Province are undertaking various self-salvation through production efforts, with fish production being very high, becoming a major source of income for the disaster victims. It is estimated that the entire province can organize more than 800,000 people to engage in fishing production this winter and next spring, producing more than 240 million catties of fish, generating a profit of 178.6 billion yuan, enough to feed more than 930,000 people for eight months. In the Funan Prefecture, the three counties of Fengtai, Yingshang, and Huaiyuan along the Huai River have recently been catching an average of more than 570,000 catties of fish per day. In the areas along the Yangtze River, 200,000 to 300,000 catties of fresh fish are brought to market every day. According to experienced veteran fishermen, this year's fish production is historically unprecedented.

    The high fish production is, of course, a gratifying thing, but if the purchase problem is not well resolved, it will still be a serious burden for the disaster victims. Currently, the state-owned aquatic products companies and cooperatives purchase very small amounts each day. According to statistics from the aquatic products company, the highest daily purchase volume in Wuhu is only 150,000 catties, and the lowest is only 70,000 catties; Anqing averages 40,000 to 50,000 catties per day; Bengbu (including fish from Hongze Lake) purchases a maximum of 80,000 to 100,000 catties per day. Such purchase figures fall far short of meeting the needs of fishermen in disaster areas. In addition, the aquatic products companies and cooperatives are unable to sell the fish in a timely manner after purchase, which directly affects the continued purchase work and, of course, the livelihood income of the disaster victims. Fengtai County has produced more than 8.55 million catties of fish, but as of October 19, the cooperative had only purchased more than 50,000 catties. The masses are very dissatisfied with this. In some areas, because the aquatic products companies and cooperatives purchase small quantities and cannot meet the needs of the masses, private merchants seize the opportunity to lower the purchase price, causing the fishermen to suffer great losses. Taking Fengtai County as an example, according to statistics, by mid-October, private merchants had purchased more than 3.7 million catties of fresh fish, at an average price of only 300 to 400 yuan per catty, and they were even unable to sell it. Therefore, rapidly resolving the purchase and sales problem of fish products in our province is an urgent problem to be solved.

    Based on our current production and sales situation, in addition to doing our best to expand sales locally, more than one-third of the fish products must be sold to other provinces. Therefore, we have sent people to major cities to promote sales, but not only have they not been successful, but some provincial and municipal aquatic products companies and cooperatives have even requested that previously signed contracts be cancelled. For example, the sales contract for 500,000 catties of preserved fish signed by the Anhui Aquatic Products Company and the Suzhou Aquatic Products Company of Jiangsu Province is now only acknowledged by the latter for 200,000 catties; the cooperatives in Changshu and Kunshan had ordered 400,000 catties of preserved fish, and the Hunan Provincial Aquatic Products Company had already ordered 95,000 catties, but now both parties are requesting cancellation; the Shandong Provincial Fisheries Union had ordered 500,000 catties of iced fresh fish, but now they do not plan to order it. This increases the difficulty of selling fish products.

    In addition, many difficulties have also arisen in transportation work. Certain transportation departments emphasize the priority of "freight" and the importance and urgency of goods, stubbornly setting aside fresh fish, resulting in the spoilage and deterioration of fresh fish, making it impossible to transport it out. Currently, the Bengbu Railway Station cannot even transport ten pieces of fresh fish (each piece is 100 catties of fresh fish, 40 catties of ice, and an 8-catty basket) per day. There are also problems with ship transportation. Some transportation staff do not proceed from the point of view of disaster relief and emphasize that the transport of fresh fish affects the health of passengers. For example, large ships passing through Wuhu cannot meet the demand for fresh fish transportation. Small boats from Hexian to Wuhu limit the loading of 15 pieces of fresh fish per day, and even if there is space in the cabin, they will not carry it.

    In order to solve the current difficulties in purchasing, transporting, and selling, I suggest:

    1. Supply and marketing units in major cities across the country should vigorously support the sales of fish products from disaster areas. All those who have signed contracts with disaster areas should earnestly fulfill the contracts and quickly sell the fish products from disaster areas to consumers.

    2. Transportation departments should, as much as possible, meet the transportation tools required by disaster areas for the transportation and sales of fish products; and under the condition of adapting to the timely transportation of fresh fish, the railway departments should increase the supply of refrigerated cars. In terms of transportation prices, the principle of saving circulation costs should be adopted, and unified and reasonable management should be achieved as much as possible.

    3. State-owned aquatic products companies and supply and marketing cooperative branches in disaster areas should, under the leadership of local Party and government, strengthen the operation and management of fish products, correctly grasp the market price of fish; and promptly purchase and promptly transport them out; appropriate arrangements should be made for miscellaneous fish that do not meet the specifications for external transportation.

    I believe that doing a good job in the purchase, transportation, and sales of fish products is a political task to support the masses in disaster areas in production and disaster relief. As long as all parties cooperate, the problem of fish purchase, transportation, and sales can be solved.

### 迅速解决灾区鱼产的出路

　　迅速解决灾区鱼产的出路
    编辑同志：安徽省灾区群众在进行各项生产自救工作中，鱼的产量很大，成为灾民的主要收入。估计全省今冬明春可组织八十多万人投入捕鱼生产，可产鱼二亿四千余万斤，获利一千七百八十六亿元，供九十三万余人吃八个月的口粮。阜阳专区沿淮河的凤台、颍上等三个县最近平均每天捕鱼五十七万斤以上。沿江地区每天上市的鲜鱼就有二、三十万斤。据有经验的老渔民谈，今年鱼的产量之大，在历史上是少有的。
    鱼的产量很大当然是可喜的事情，但是收购问题如果不能很好解决，仍然是灾民的严重负担。现在，国营水产公司和合作社每天的收购量很小，据水产公司统计：芜湖每日最高收购量不过十五万斤，最低仅七万斤；安庆每天平均收购四、五万斤；蚌埠（包括洪泽湖的鱼产）每日最多收购八万至十万斤。这样的收购数字远远不能满足灾区渔民的要求。加上水产公司和合作社在收购以后不能及时售出去，这就直接影响到鱼的继续收购工作，当然也就影响到灾民的生活收入。凤台县已产鱼八百五十五万多斤，但到十月十九日止合作社仅收购了五万多斤。群众对此很不满意。有些地区因为水产公司和合作社收购的数量少，不能满足群众的需要，私商乘机杀价收购，使渔民吃了大亏。以凤台县为例，据统计到十月中旬仅私商收购的鲜鱼就有三百七十多万斤，每斤平均仅三、四百元。甚至还卖不出去。因此，迅速解决我省鱼产的收购和销路问题，是当前急待解决的问题。
    根据我们当前的产销情况来看，除了我们尽力设法扩大在本地的销路以外，还有三分之一以上的鱼产品必须向外省推销。因此，我们曾派人到各大城市推销，但是不但没有推销成功，反而有些省市的水产公司和合作社要求把以前所订的合同也撤销。例如，安徽水产公司与江苏省苏州水产公司订立的卤鱼五十万斤的销售合同，现在对方只承认二十万斤；常熟及昆山各合作社订卤鱼四十万斤，湖南省水产公司已订的九万五千斤的销售合同，现对方都要求撤销；山东省渔业联合社订冰鲜五十万斤，现在不打算订购了。这样，增加了鱼产的销售困难。
    此外，在运输工作上也发生了不少困难。某些运输部门强调“货运”的先后次序，轻重缓急，硬把鲜鱼搁在一旁，结果，鲜鱼腐烂变质，运不出去。目前蚌埠车站每天就连十件鲜鱼（每件是一百斤鲜鱼，四十斤冰，八斤篓子）都不能运出。在轮船运输上也有问题，有些运输工作人员不从救灾观点出发，强调装运鲜鱼影响旅客健康。如大轮经过芜湖时就不能满足鲜鱼的装运。和县到芜湖的小轮每日限制装十五件鲜鱼，虽然船舱有空位也不承运。
    为了解决当前收购运销工作中的困难，我建议：
    一、全国各大城市的供销单位大力支援灾区鱼产的销售工作，凡是已经和灾区签订合同的应该认真履行合同，迅速地把灾区鱼产销到消费者手里。
    二、交通运输部门，要尽可能满足灾区对鱼产运销方面所需用的运输工具；并在适应鲜鱼及时外运的情况下，铁道部门要增拨冷藏车皮的供应。在运输的价格方面，应以节省流转费用为原则，尽量得到统一合理的管理。
    三、灾区国营水产公司及供销合作社分支机构在当地党、政领导下，加强对鱼产的经营管理，正确地掌握鱼类的市场价格；并且要及时收购及时外运；对不合外运规格的杂鱼要作适当安排。
    我认为做好鱼产的收购运销工作是支援灾区群众生产救灾的一项政治任务。只要各方面协同合作，鱼的收购、运销问题是可以解决的。
