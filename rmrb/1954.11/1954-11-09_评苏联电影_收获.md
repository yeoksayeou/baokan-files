    Review of the Soviet Film "Harvest"
    Ba Ren
    The film "Harvest" (also known as "The Return of Vasily Bortnikov") is adapted from Nikolaeva's novel "Harvest." Chinese readers greatly admire "Harvest," this famous novel, and will therefore have great interest in the film "Harvest." In particular, this film mainly focuses on the portrayal of the character Vasily Bortnikov, which will have a great educational effect on Chinese audiences. This is because Vasily is such a person: infinitely loyal to the Party's socialist cause, but inherently stubborn, decisive, and overly self-confident, lacking a mass viewpoint, and crude in his style; he is selfless in the collective cause, but regards his wife as a "possession" and "appendage" – old private habits and backward feelings are closely intertwined with his lofty ideals for the socialist cause and his sense of responsibility for moving forward. This character image is precisely a portrayal of the ideological feelings of the awakened peasant class tending towards the advanced working class. The film's emphasis is on dealing with the transformation and transition process of such a character image, which is indeed the best lesson for the Chinese people in a period of national transition. It is very meaningful that the film "Harvest" is being shown during the film week commemorating the October Revolution.
    According to the author of the novel, she had long wanted to write a book about the characters in collective farms. She started many times and often visited collective farms in various Soviet states. She was interested in people, agricultural technology, figures, and the annual reports of collective farms. These travels helped her understand the basic processes of events in collective farms and the countryside, and to understand a main thing: that the achievements of collective farm construction depend entirely on how well the organizational work and the Party work are done. However, after her first draft was written, she found a major flaw in the novel: it did not reflect the significant role of technology in collective farm production, nor did it point out the mark that technology has left on the character of the people in the Soviet countryside today. Thus, she traveled again, visiting agricultural machinery stations in various Soviet states, investigating the actual situation of agricultural machinery stations, and getting to know many tractor drivers, technicians, and engineers. After collecting enough materials, she rewrote the novel.
    According to the author's statement, we can understand that the author attempts to reflect the following theme through the description of the basic processes of some events in collective farms and the portrayal of the characters in the collective farm countryside: that is, the decisive role of the Party's leadership in the construction of the Soviet socialist cause, and the significant impact of industrial technology on agricultural production. And this theme is expressed in a more concentrated form in the film.
    The film adopts the thread of the love entanglement and psychological changes between Vasily, Stepan, and Avdotya from the novel, and intersperses it with the innocent and naive love relationship between the young couple Pavel and Floska. This was originally a basic plot in the novel; but in the novel, there are more threads, more complex descriptions of social relations, and more extensive descriptions of the struggle between decadent private habits and new socialist morality, which are simplified and concentrated in the film. The film seems to focus more on resolving these contradictions to strengthen its political education role. That is, under the correct and strong leadership of the Party, the contradiction between advanced industrial technology and backward agricultural production is resolved, and under the resolution of this contradiction, the contradiction between the beautiful moral qualities of the working people embodied in Avdotya's soul and the decadent private habits embodied in Vasily's soul is also resolved. Therefore, the descriptions of family life and private life, which occupy a considerable amount of space in the novel, are replaced in the film by a large number of descriptions of collective life and public life - district committee activities, tractor station meetings and work, farm production, youth league members' activities, milk farm scenes, etc.; this cannot help but make the audience feel that all personal "entanglements" and all individualistic thoughts and feelings can be overcome and transformed in the collective life of moving forward together. The power of the great collective!
    In emphasizing the Party's leading role, the film replaced some characters in the novel, and the activities of some characters were either expanded or reduced. In the novel, the "May 1st" collective farm is led by the county party secretary Andrei, but he mainly strengthens the leadership of the collective farm through the activities of his wife, Valentina, whom he sent there; the film has been changed to the direct leadership of the district party secretary Cheganov. Cheganov's activities occupy a considerable number of scenes in the film: at the same time, the image of this leader is also quite distinct. He is a leader who is able to do things himself, comprehensively care about the cause, get close to the masses, carefully care for comrades, and have a spirit of adhering to principles. In terms of leadership style, he forms a clear contrast with Vasily. Wherever he appears, he brings vitality and joy to the masses. It should be said that this is an image of a Bolshevik, but also a typical Soviet person. It was he who enabled Vasily to gain ideological and emotional transformation in the advancement of his cause. Although Dagyana, the party branch secretary of the collective farm—who replaces Valentina in the novel—also helped Vasily improve mass relations and gave him the necessary Bolshevik criticism and care, her activities in the film are not very prominent and are abstracted. The Party's transformative role on the working people and its leading force in the construction cause are mainly reflected through the activities of the district party secretary Cheganov.
    The film also particularly emphasizes the importance of creating an industrial culture in agriculture. And the creation of industrial culture is still treated in the film as the material basis for transforming people's old private habits and making them have socialist moral qualities. There are different opinions between Cheganov and the director of the tractor station, Kadaulov, on the development of the collective farm cause. The former advocates establishing a tractor factory, while the latter believes that this question is raised too early, and the urgent need at present is to request the allocation of tractors from the higher authorities. Here, the different views on how to strengthen industrial leadership in agriculture are expressed. Therefore, Cheganov appears to us as a lively character, while the director of the tractor station, Kadaulov, appears to us as a vulgar image. The film also depicts the ignorant image of Vega, who only cares about immediate interests and arbitrarily dismantles combine harvesters for lack of parts. The film also uses the technique of interspersed contrast to reflect the party group meeting of the collective farm on the one hand, and the party member congress of the tractor station workshop on the other; the former mainly criticizes Vasily's mass viewpoint and work style; the latter mainly criticizes the reckless behavior of not having an industrial culture in agricultural production, and emphasizes the importance of industrial technology to agricultural development. Here, the appearance of female engineer Dubgug in the film has a certain suggestive meaning. She is an engineer working in a factory: the leading role of the city in the countryside, the leading role of industry in agriculture, and the leading role of the working class in collective farmers are hinted at in this character. It was she who exposed Vega's arbitrary dismantling of the combine harvester with Kadaulov's permission at the party member congress, and put forward the criticism of not having an industrial culture. It was her criticism that prompted the district party secretary Cheganov to put forward the call to "create an industrial culture in agriculture," and thereby encouraged the masses' confidence in the national construction cause. At the same time, it was also she who checked that the concentric needle configuration of the tractor was not in accordance with scientific standards, causing the tractor to often have accidents and affecting the progress of production, and thereby proved the importance of industrial culture to agricultural production. The farm's cause is advancing under such circumstances.
    The film focuses more on grasping the character of the main characters provided by the novel. These are Vasily Bortnikov and Avdotya. In addition, the young couple Pavel and Floska are also portrayed.
    Avdotya is a typical example of all kind, loving, and broad-minded working women. We have also found this type of person and her advancing power in Gorky's "Mother" in the person of Vlasova; we can also see this typical image among the working women in the Chinese countryside, just as we can find the image of Vasily in our revolutionary ranks. In the film, although we do not see the lively and innocent, proactive, and eager to work attitude of Avdotya in her youth as described in the novel, her gentle, tolerant, selfless spirit of loving labor, and her simple character combined with her great maternal heart are embodied in the film to a considerable extent. Naturally, the complete and reasonable development of her beautiful spiritual qualities only came after she went to the city to attend a livestock training class for a few weeks. Her contact with the vast world of creative labor made her think of the world she was in as a "warm, unsinkable lake" like the one her aunt described in the past. People can swim freely in that lake. This "warm, unsinkable lake"-like world strengthened her good wish of "living according to the truth and working with conscience, everything will be fine," and she no longer fell into the abyss of pain caused by Vasily's "cold treatment." She placed her entire life in the construction of the socialist cause, and finally, because of the remarkable achievements of her creative labor, awakened Vasily's old love for her.
    In dealing with the character of Vasily, the film also portrayed his transformation in the advancement of the common cause, making him capable of taking on the leadership task of the collective farm entrusted to him by the Party, but the film also pointed out that he needs further cultivation. At the end of the film, the district party secretary decided to send him to the leadership training class of the collective farm to study. This not only implies that the Party will give this loyal Bolshevik the leadership knowledge of industrial culture, but also implies that the Party will also make him have complete socialist ideological qualities. In the study, he will not only be further cultivated but also be further transformed.
    The film's description of the activities of Pavel and Floska shows the lively, innocent, brave, straightforward, and constantly demanding to move forward character of the Soviet society's younger generation. Floska's innocent and playful actions and her upright and selfless character are very attractive in the film. She cannot stand the fact that the farm work is not done on time and not according to the system, and she constantly reports to the higher authorities; she eagerly hopes to become a combine harvester captain from a tractor driver, and she has indeed set an example in her work, especially her simple love with Pavel, which is completely integrated with the collective life and completely devoid of the dirty things dominated by personal possessiveness. The film's director seems to focus on describing this point, using it to make a clear contrast with the love life of Vasily and his generation who came from the old society: and this is precisely the direction of the road of life for people in Soviet society. The young new forces are also the main force in opening up new roads of life.
    Although the film only adopts fragments of the novel, its own artistic composition is organic and complete. It is based on the spirit of selfless labor and the atmosphere of active collective life of Soviet society, and it is rich in strong educational effects. I believe that art is not only a simple reflection of life, but more importantly, it makes people recognize life, recognize the essence of life, and recognize the truth of life through it. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze life and criticize life in artistic works; but it is to analyze life and criticize life by means of images. In analyzing life and criticizing life, it is also necessary to reflect what forces are leading life and which direction life is being led to. And this is the political nature of artistic works. Some of our writers or critics have always been immersed in the description of the details of life in artistic works, believing that having rich details of life means having rich artistry. But they do not understand or do not want to understand that the description of the details of life that must be possessed in artistic works should be subordinate to the needs of the artistic composition of the entire work. And the artistic composition of the entire work is organized based on the essential forces of life. What is this essential force of life? In a word, it is political. Life and politics are inseparable, and politics is still the essential force that organizes life. Some people among us even put politics in parentheses in their articles to oppose the importance of describing the details of life, or only emphasize the ordinary life of ordinary people and ignore the most important point in artistic works, which is what force leads the ordinary life of ordinary people. I think this is all a manifestation of viewing the rich reality of life from their own narrow circle of life because they are good at feeling the details of life but not good at feeling the essential forces of life. This is precisely the viewpoint of naturalism or objectivism in literary and artistic thought. But whether it is naturalism or objectivism, in essence, it is a literary and artistic thought based on idealism. The film "Harvest" is obviously not satisfied with the requirements of these people in the "ivory tower," but it is precisely this point that the film "Harvest" has its own unique features.

    评苏联电影“收获”
    巴人
    电影“收获”（一名“华西里·波尔特尼可夫的归来”）是根据尼古拉耶娃的小说“收获”改编的。中国读者非常喜爱“收获”这册著名的小说，因之对电影“收获”也将发生极大的兴趣。特别是这电影主要是集中于华西里·波尔特尼可夫这个人物形象的刻划，对中国的观众将会有很大教育作用。因为华西里是这样一个人物：对党的社会主义事业有无限忠诚，但生性固执、果断、自信甚强，缺乏群众观点，作风粗暴；他对集体事业是大公无私的，但，对自己的妻子却又看作是“占有物”和“附属品”——陈旧的私有习惯和落后感情是跟他对社会主义事业的远大理想和前进的责任感相互密切地纠缠着的。这个人物形象正是觉悟的农民阶级趋向于先进的工人阶级的思想感情的写照。电影的着重点就是处理这样一个人物形象的改造和转变过程，这对处在国家过渡时期的中国人民确实是最好的一课。电影“收获”在为纪念十月革命节举办的电影周演出，那是很有意义的。
    据小说作者告诉我们：她早就想写一本关于集体农庄中的人物的书。她着手过好多次，而且经常到苏联各州的集体农庄上去访问。人哪、农业技术哪、数目字哪、集体农庄的年度报告哪，都使她感到兴趣。这些旅行帮助她明了集体农庄和乡村中一些事件的基本过程，和懂得了一件主要事情：这就是集体农庄建设的成就全靠组织工作和党的工作做得如何而决定的。然而当她初稿写成以后，发现小说里有一个很大的缺点：这就是在她的小说初稿里，没有反映出技术在集体农庄生产中的重大作用，没有指出技术在今日苏联农村人物性格上留下的烙印。这样，她又去旅行，走遍了苏联各州的农业机器站，考察了农业机器站的实际情况，认识了许多拖拉机手、技术员和工程师。搜足了材料以后，她又来改写这部小说。
    按照作者的说法，我们就可以明白：作者是企图通过对集体农庄一些事件的基本过程的描写、对集体农庄乡村中人物性格的刻划，来反映这样一个主题思想的：即在苏联社会主义事业建设中的党的领导的决定作用，和工业技术对农业生产的重大影响。而这一个主题思想，在电影中以更集中的形式给表现出来了。
    电影采取小说中有关华西里、斯特潘和阿芙多蒂亚这三人间的爱情纠葛及其心理变化这一线索，并穿插了巴维尔和弗洛斯卡这一对青年男女的烂漫天真的爱情关系。这本来也是小说中的基本情节；但在小说中还有更多的线索，更复杂的社会关系的描写，和更广泛的陈腐的私有习惯同新的社会主义道德之间的斗争的描写，在电影中是被简化和集中了。电影似乎更着重于这些矛盾的解决，来加强其政治教育的作用。这就是在党的正确和强有力的领导下，解决了先进工业技术和落后的农业生产的矛盾，并在这一矛盾的解决下，也解决了体现在阿芙多蒂亚的灵魂里的那种优美的劳动人民的道德品质和体现在华西里的灵魂里的那种陈腐的私有习惯的矛盾。因之，在小说中占有相当篇幅的家庭生活、私人生活的描写，在电影中却以大量的——区委的活动、拖拉机站的会议和工作，农庄的生产，青年团员的活动，牛奶场的画面等等——集体生活和公共生活的描写来代替了；这不能不使观众发生这样的感觉：一切个人之间的“纠葛”、一切个人主义的思想感情，在共同前进的集体生活中是可以得到克服和改造的。伟大的集体的力量！
    电影在强调党的领导作用方面，把小说中若干人物更换了，若干人物的活动或者被扩大或者被缩小了。在小说中“五一”集体农场是由县委书记安德烈领导的，但他主要是通过他派去的自己的妻子瓦林蒂娜的活动而加强对集体农庄的领导；电影则已改为区委书记切甘诺夫直接的领导。切甘诺夫的活动在电影中占相当多的画面：同时这个领导人物的形象也相当鲜明。他是一个能够亲自动手、全面关心事业、接近群众、细心体贴同志、并有坚持原则精神的领导者的形象。在领导作风方面，他和华西里形成了一个鲜明的对照。凡是他出现的地方，群众就带来了生气和欢乐。应该说，这是布尔什维克的形象，但也是一个普通的苏联人的典型。正是他，使华西里在他的事业的前进中获得了思想感情方面的改造。虽然，集体农庄的党组织书记达吉亚娜——代替小说中瓦林蒂娜出现的——也帮助了华西里改进了群众关系，给予他应有的布尔什维克的批评和关心，但在电影中她的活动是并不很显著的，是被抽象化了的。党对劳动人民的改造作用和对建设事业的领导力量，主要是通过区委书记切甘诺夫的活动而体现出来的。
    电影还特别强调在农业中创造工业文化的重要性。而创造工业文化这件事，在电影中还是把它作为改造人们陈旧的私有习惯而使之具有社会主义的道德品质的物质基础来处理的。切甘诺夫和拖拉机站主任卡达乌洛夫之间对发展集体农庄事业有不同的意见，前者主张要建立个拖拉机工厂，而后者则认为这个问题提得太早，目前迫切需要是向上级请求拨下拖拉机来。这里就表现如何加强工业对农业的领导的不同观点，所以，切甘诺夫在我们面前出现时是个有生气的人物，而拖拉机站主任卡达乌洛夫在我们面前出现时则是一个庸俗的形象。电影也描写了只顾眼前利益、为了零件不够用随便拆卸联合收割机的维嘉的无知的形象。电影还以相互穿插的对照手法，映出了一方面集体农庄的党小组会议，另一方面拖拉机站车间的党员大会；前者主要是批判华西里的群众观点和工作作风的；后者主要是批判在农业生产中没有工业文化的胡乱行为，并强调工业技术对农业发展的重要的。在这里，女工程师杜勃谷在电影中出现，是具有一定的暗示意义的。她是一个在工厂里工作的工程师：城市对农村的领导作用，工业对农业的领导作用，工人阶级对集体农民的领导作用，在这个人物上得到暗示。是她，在党员大会上揭发了维嘉在卡达乌洛夫的允许下，随便拆卸联合机，并提出没有工业文化的批评。是她的批评，使区委书记切甘诺夫提出“在农业中必须创造工业文化”的号召，并由此鼓励了群众对国家建设事业的信心。同时，也是她，检查出了拖拉机的同心针配置不合科学标准，使拖拉机常常发生事故，影响了生产的进行，并由此来证明工业文化对农业生产的重要性。农庄的事业就是在这种情况下前进了。
    电影更着重地掌握了小说所提供的主要人物的性格。这就是华西里·波尔特尼可夫和阿芙多蒂亚。此外，还刻划了巴维尔和弗洛斯卡这一对青年男女。
    阿芙多蒂亚是一切善良的、慈爱的、有宽阔胸怀的劳动妇女的典型，我们在高尔基的“母亲”中的维拉索华的身上也发现过这种典型和她的前进力量；我们也可从中国乡村的劳动妇女中看到这种典型形象，这正和我们在我们革命队伍中能够发现华西里这个形象一样。在电影中，虽然我们看不到在小说中所叙述的阿芙多蒂亚年青时代的活泼而天真、工作积极抢先的姿态，但她那温和、容忍、爱劳动的忘我精神和她那伟大的母性胸怀相结合的单纯性格在电影中是在相当的程度上体现出来的。自然，她所具有的这种优美的精神品质得到完全合理的发展，还是在她到城里上了几个星期的畜牧讲习班以后的事。她接触到广大的创造劳动的世界，使她想到自己所处的世界，正是个和过去姑母所描摹的“不沉的温暖的湖”一样的。人在那湖上是可以自由自在地游泳的。这个“不沉的温暖的湖”似的世界坚定了她那“按真理生活，凭良心工作一切都会好的”的善良愿望，她不再陷在由于华西里的“冷遇”而感到苦痛的深渊里了。她在社会主义事业的建设中寄托了她整个的生命，并且终于因她那创造性的劳动的显著成就，唤醒了华西里对她的旧日爱情。
    电影在处理华西里这个人物时，虽然也刻划了他在共同事业的前进中得到改造，使他担当得起党交给他的集体农庄的领导任务，但电影还指出对他需要进一步培养。电影在结束时，由区委书记决定送他到集体农庄的领导训练班去学习。这不但暗示了党将给这个忠诚的布尔什维克以工业文化的领导知识，并且也在暗示党还将使他具有完全的社会主义的思想品质，在学习中他不但得到进一步培养，并且会得到进一步改造。
    电影关于巴维尔和弗洛斯卡的活动的描写，显示出苏维埃社会青年一代的活泼、天真、勇敢、爽直和不断要求前进的性格。弗洛斯卡那种天真、顽皮的行动，和正直、无私的性格，在电影中是十分吸引人的。她看不惯农庄工作中不按时间，不照制度办事，她不断向上级打报告；她热切期望自己从拖拉机手变成一个联合收割机队长，并且的确在工作中树立了模范，尤其是她跟巴维尔那种纯朴的恋爱，这种爱情是和集体生活完全融为一体的，完全没有为个人占有欲所支配的那种肮脏的东西。电影的编导似乎着力描写这一点，用来和旧社会生活过来的像华西里他们那一代的爱情生活作个鲜明的对照：而这正是苏维埃社会里人们的生活道路的前进方向。年青的新生力量也是开辟新生活道路的主要力量。
    电影虽然仅仅采取小说的片断，但它本身的艺术构成是有机的、完整的。它是以苏维埃社会的充满忘我劳动的精神和活跃的集体生活的气氛作为背景的，它是富有强烈的教育作用的。我以为艺术不仅是单纯地反映生活，更重要的，却是使人借它而认识生活、认识生活的本质，认识生活的真理性。因之，在艺术作品中就必须分析生活、批判生活；但它是用形象的手段来分析生活和批判生活的。它在分析生活和批判生活中还须反映出是什么力量领导着生活，并把生活领导到哪一个方向去。而这，就是艺术作品中的政治性。我们之间有些作家或批评家，一向沈醉于艺术作品的生活细节的描写，认为有丰富的生活细节就有丰富的艺术性。但他们不理解或者不想理解艺术作品中所必须具备的生活细节的描写，是应该服从于整个作品的艺术构成的需要的。而整个作品的艺术构成是以生活的本质力量为依据而组织起来的。这种生活的本质力量是什么呢？一言以蔽之，就是政治性。生活和政治不可分，政治还是组织生活的本质力量。我们之间，有些人在他们的文章中竟把政治性加上一个括号，来和生活细节的描写的重要性对立起来，或者只强调什么普通人的普通生活而忽视是什么力量领导着普通人的普通生活这个在艺术作品中最重要的一点。我以为这都是从他们自己狭隘的生活圈子来看丰富的现实生活的一种表现，因为他们善于感受生活细节，而不善于感受生活的本质力量。这正是文艺思想上自然主义或客观主义的观点。但不论自然主义或客观主义，本质上都是以唯心论为依据的文艺思想。电影“收获”是显然不会满足这些“象牙之塔”里的人们的要求的，但正是这一点，电影“收获”是有独到之处的。
