Across the country, the promotion of Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction method has universally increased oil yield.

In 1952, the local state-owned Shengli Oil Factory in Siping City, Northeast China, saw the emergence of worker Li Chuanjiang's advanced experience in soybean oil extraction, achieving an oil yield of over 14 jin per 100 jin of soybeans, creating the highest record for manual oil pressing in the country. Subsequently, the Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South regions successively promoted this advanced oil extraction experience, universally increasing oil yields. After the full promotion of Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction operation method in the Northeast region, by the second quarter of this year, the average oil yield per 100 jin of raw materials in the region had reached 12.8 jin, with some factories reaching a maximum of 14.9 jin. According to surveys, the average oil yield per 100 jin of raw materials in 1953 increased by more than 1.5 jin compared to 1952. Significant results have also been achieved in some areas of East China, North China, and Central South after promotion. The oil factories under the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry have increased the oil yield of various raw materials, with soybeans generally increasing by 1 to 2 jin, and the most increasing by 3 jin; cottonseed generally increasing oil yield by more than 2 jin; and peanuts increasing by an average of 4 to 5 jin. The rapeseed oil yield in Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu, increased by an average of 4 jin. In the past, the manual pressing of soybeans in Zhejiang Province's oil factories generally yielded 8.5 jin per 100 jin. After promoting Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction experience, the average soybean oil yield in the province has reached 11.49 jin. Currently, according to statistics from nine oil factories in Henan Province, due to the promotion of advanced experience, an additional 480,000 jin of edible oil has been produced for the country.

In oil factories equipped with automatic screw presses, the oil content in the cake has decreased due to the application of the basic principles of this operating method to improve operating procedures. The residual oil rate in peanut cake at Qingdao Oil Factory decreased from 5.93% to below 5%; the residual oil rate in cottonseed cake at the state-owned China Oil and Fat Chemical Factory in Tianjin decreased from over 8% in March to 5.85% in September.

Many cities have promoted the use of cold-pressed (oil extraction methods without baking, steaming, or other heating processes) soybean cake to make tofu and hot-pressed soybean cake to make soy sauce, and have achieved certain results.

The regions that are now using cold-pressed soybean cake to make tofu include Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, as well as major cities in six provinces including Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Gansu, and Zhejiang. Trials in Shanghai have proven that tofu made from cold-pressed soybean cake can be used to make any type of tofu product, and its nutritional value is almost the same as tofu made directly from soybeans. In Shanghai and Beijing alone, the promotion of this experience can save oil and produce 5,200 tons of oil products annually, creating wealth worth over 52 billion yuan for the country.

Since January of this year, Shanghai has been promoting the use of soybean cake instead of soybeans to make soy sauce throughout the city. The quality of the finished product is very good, the same as that made directly from soybeans. Currently, cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Xi'an, as well as some areas in Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, have also successfully conducted trials and have begun to promote it. According to statistics, after using this method, Shanghai and parts of Jiangsu Province alone can save oil and produce more than 1,250 tons of oil products annually.

The China Oil and Fat Company notified the state-owned oil and fat systems in various regions at the end of October to continue promoting these two methods to save oil and increase oil production.

    各地食油厂推广先进经验提高出油率
    许多城市推广节约油料增加油品生产的新方法
    各地推广李川江大豆榨油操作法以后，普遍提高了出油率。
    一九五二年，东北区四平市地方国营胜利油厂中出现了工人李川江大豆榨油的先进经验，每百斤大豆的出油率达到十四斤以上，创造了全国人力榨油率的最高纪录。此后，东北、华北、华东、中南等地区均先后推广了这一先进的榨油经验，普遍提高了出油率。东北区全面推广李川江大豆榨油操作法后，到今年第二季度止，全区平均每百斤原料出油量已达到十二点八斤，有些工厂最高达到十四点九斤。据调查，一九五三年每百斤原料平均出油量比一九五二年提高一点五斤以上。在华东、华北、中南等部分地区推广后，也都获得了显著成绩。山东省工业厅所属各油厂，各种原料出油率都提高了，大豆一般提高了一斤到二斤，最多的提高到三斤；棉籽一般提高出油量二斤以上；花生平均提高了四斤到五斤。江苏盐城专区菜籽出油量平均提高了四斤。浙江省各油厂人力榨大豆过去每百斤出油量一般为八点五斤，推广李川江榨油经验以后，全省大豆出油量平均已达到十一点四九斤。目前据河南省九个油厂的统计，由于推广先进经验，已为国家多产食油四十八万斤。
    在设有自动螺旋机的油厂，由于运用了这一个操作法的基本原理改进了操作方法，饼中含油率均有下降。青岛油厂花生饼残油率由百分之五点九三降到百分之五以下；天津市国营中国油脂化学厂棉饼残油率由三月份的百分之八以上降低到九月份的百分之五点八五。

    许多城市推广用冷榨（不经过烘、蒸等加热过程的榨油方法）豆饼制豆腐、用热榨豆饼制酱油，已获得一定成绩。
    现在已使用冷榨豆饼制豆腐的地区，有上海、北京、天津以及安徽、山东、江苏、山西、甘肃和浙江等六省的主要城市。上海市在试制中证明用冷榨豆饼制成的豆腐，完全可以制作任何豆腐类食品，其营养价值比直接用大豆做的差不多。仅上海、北京两市，在推广这一经验后，每年节约的油料，可生产油品五千二百吨，约可为国家创造财富五百二十多亿元。
    上海市自从今年一月份开始，就在全市推广用豆饼代替大豆制酱油，成品质量很好，同直接用大豆制的一样。现在北京、广州、武汉、西安等城市以及江苏、山东、山西、河北、河南等省的某些地方也已试制成功，并已开始推广。据统计，仅上海市、江苏省部分地区使用这一方法后，每年节省的油料可生产油品一千二百五十多吨。
    中国油脂公司为此在十月底通报各地国营油脂系统，继续推广这两个方法，以节约油料、增加油品生产。
