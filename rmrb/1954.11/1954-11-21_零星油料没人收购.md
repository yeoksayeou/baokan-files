One way to make up for the shortage of oils is to encourage farmers to use vacant land to plant scattered oilseed crops and to pay attention to the purchase of these crops in a timely manner. Since the autumn harvest, the sunflowers planted in various places have had a bumper harvest, but some purchasing units have not paid attention to this part of the oilseed crop. According to reader Zhang Bingqian's letter: "In order to increase oilseed crop production, the Hebei Provincial People's Government provided farmers with a large number of sunflower seeds free of charge, so this year's sunflower seed production has increased unprecedentedly. According to incomplete statistics, Zhangjiakou Prefecture alone planted 132,900 mu, with an estimated average yield of more than 125 jin per mu. Now that the sunflower seeds have been harvested, some farmers took the sunflower seeds to the local supply and marketing cooperative to sell, but the cadres in the cooperative said: 'We have not received a notice from the higher authorities to purchase sunflower seeds!' or 'The purchase price has not been set yet! We will not purchase them for the time being.' Some also said: 'These few sunflower seeds are too small to purchase.' So the farmers reflected one after another: 'The government only called on us to plant, why doesn't it purchase them after we have grown them?'" Reader Xu Guotian wrote: The masses of Taoshang Township, Anyi County, Shanxi Province, planted 8,300 sunflower plants this year using the vacant land on the sides of fields and roads, and it is estimated that more than 1,500 jin can be harvested. Every household has already dried and cleaned them, but they still cannot be sold to this day.

In some places, because sunflower seeds and other oilseeds are not purchased, farmers eat them as snacks. For example, Zhao Butian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuqiao Village, Dongguang County, Hebei Province, planted more than 1,000 sunflower plants this year, and after harvesting them, more than half were eaten. In Beigaozhuang, Nanhe County, 600 farmers planted an average of more than 20 sunflower plants per household, and some households have already eaten all the sunflower seeds. Reader Huang Jinyi wrote: Farmers in Henan Province have increased the planting of castor beans and sunflowers this year, but because no one is purchasing them, some farmers are selling them retail in the market. In the suburbs of Luohe City, I saw a farmer named Chen Youfu carrying two baskets of sunflower seeds to the market for retail sale. He said: "This was planted at the call of the government, but no one is purchasing it after it has been planted. It is too little to squeeze oil ourselves, so we have to sell it retail to eat it."

The phenomenon of oilseed crops not being purchased and even being wasted is obviously detrimental to the country's construction. Tang Rongyi wrote: "The amount of sunflowers wasted in my country over the years is very large. Taking Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, as an example, the county produced about 300,000 jin of sunflower seeds in 1953, while the state only purchased more than 6,000 jin, and almost all of them were wasted. Wuchang City and Shanhe Town, two small towns with a total population of less than 40,000, consumed 200,000 jin." This is a loss. Readers pointed out in their letters: The oil yield of sunflower seeds can reach 40 percent. It can not only be used to make edible oil products and has broad uses in industry, but the state can also use it as a material to exchange for foreign exchange. If it is allowed to be wasted, it will be detrimental to the country and the people.

Commercial departments in various places, especially supply and marketing cooperatives in sunflower seed and castor bean producing areas, must seize the current sunflower seed harvesting season and quickly organize purchases to avoid the continued waste of large amounts of scattered oilseeds.

### 零星油料没人收购

    零星油料没人收购
    鼓励农民利用空地种植零星油料作物，并及时注意对零星油料作物的收购，是弥补油脂不足的办法之一。秋收以来，各地种植的向日葵已经得到丰收，但是有些收购单位对于这一部分油料作物还没有引起重视。据读者张秉谦来信说：“为了增产油料作物，河北省人民政府曾无代价地供给农民大批葵花籽种，因而今年的葵花籽产量空前提高。据不完全统计，仅张家口专区就种植十三万二千九百亩，预计平均每亩可产一百二十五斤以上。现在，葵花籽已经收获起来了，有些农民拿了葵花籽送到当地供销社去卖，社里的干部却说：‘还没有接到上级收购葵花籽的通知呢！’或者说：‘还没有规定好收购价格呢！暂不收购。’也有的说：‘这点点葵花籽太少了，不好收购。’于是农民纷纷反映说：‘政府光号召我们种，种出了为啥不收购呢？’”读者许国天来信说：山西省安邑县陶上乡群众，今年利用田园路边的空地种植葵花八千三百棵，估计可收一千五百多斤，家家早已把它晒干拣净了，可是到现在为止还卖不出去。
    有些地方因为没有收购葵花籽等油料，农民就当作零食吃掉了。如河北省东光县五桥村赵步田农业生产合作社今年种了一千多棵葵花，收了以后，被吃掉一大半。南和县北高庄有六百户农民平均每户种二十多棵，现在有些户已经把葵花籽吃光了。读者黄金益来信：河南省的农民今年增植了不少的蓖麻子和向日葵，因为没有人收购，有的农民就拿到市上零售。在漯河市郊，我看到有个叫陈有富的农民，挑了两筐葵花籽上市零售，他说：“这是政府号召种的，但种了又没有人收购，自己榨油又太少，只好零卖吃掉算了。”
    油料作物无人收购以至浪费的现象，显然对国家建设事业不利。唐荣怡来信说：“历年我国出产的大批向日葵被浪费掉的数量很大，以黑龙江省五常县为例，全县在一九五三年约产葵花籽三十万斤，而国家只收购了六千多斤，几乎全被浪费了。仅五常城和山河镇这两个总共不到四万人口的小城镇，即消费了二十万斤。”这是一个损失。读者来信指出：葵花籽的出油率可达百分之四十，它不仅可以制作食用油品和在工业上有广阔的用途，而且国家还可用它作为换取外汇的物资。如果任其浪费，对国家对人民都是不利的。
    各地商业部门特别是葵花籽、蓖麻子产区的供销合作社，必须抓紧当前葵花籽收获的季节，迅速组织收购，以免大量的零星油料继续遭到浪费。
