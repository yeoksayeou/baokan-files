General Secretary of the Indian National Trade Union Congress

    The General Secretary of the Indian National Trade Union Congress and Indian Member of Parliament, Tripathi, recently returned to India on October 26 after being invited to visit China. Tripathi said that he saw genuine democracy among the Chinese working class.

    Tripathi said that in China, wages are increasing daily, and purchasing power and prices are balanced. He believes that China's land reform and women's liberation are its most remarkable achievements; he said that the government of the People's Republic of China enjoys the strong support of the broad masses of the people.

Indian Women's Delegation

    The Indian women's delegation, headed by Indian Member of Parliament Ammu Swaminathan, returned to India after a four-week visit to China at the invitation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and issued a statement to the press regarding their impressions of their visit to China.

    The statement said: "On October 1st, we attended the solemn review. After the review, we were deeply moved by the joy, spontaneous actions, and enthusiasm of the people participating in the review—workers, students, housewives, cultural circles, education circles, and art groups—representing many aspects of the life of the new Chinese people. The parade itself demonstrates the great strength and courage that has been unleashed in the past few years to build a healthier and happier China."

    The statement, in discussing the liberation of Chinese women, said: "We have all heard about the liberation of Chinese women, and what we have seen in real life fully confirms this situation. We have found in Chinese women a beautiful combination of dignity and beauty, competence and composure, and national pride."

    The statement pointed out that what deeply moved the delegation members was the welfare enjoyed by the Chinese people from childhood to old age—one of the primary concerns of the state—and various health measures, the people's enthusiasm, and a "sense of accomplishment."

    The statement expressed deep gratitude for the warm friendship and hospitality the delegation members received in China and expressed the hope that women in China and India will work to promote the cause of world peace.

Trade Union Delegation of the Britain-China Friendship Association

    The Trade Union Delegation of the Britain-China Friendship association, which was invited by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit China, issued a statement on October 29 in London after returning to London, stating that the delegation was deeply impressed by "the sincere hope of the Chinese people for peace."

    The statement said that the representatives believed that China should get its rightful place in the United Nations.

    The statement talked about the great achievements China has made in economic construction. It pointed out that the scale and speed of construction, the development of industry, and the great progress in production impressed the delegation members deeply. The statement said: "The great progress in production has greatly improved the living standards of Chinese workers and farmers in terms of wages, labor and living conditions, and welfare."

Representative of the Women of the Union of South Africa

    Mollie Fischer, representative of the women of the Union of South Africa and secretary of the South Africa-Soviet Peace and Friendship Association, who was invited by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to attend our National Day celebrations, left Beijing on the 30th to return to her country.

    During her stay in China, Mollie Fischer visited Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou.

    On the eve of her departure from China, she sent a letter to Cai Chang, chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. The letter said:

    During our long journey visiting major cities, we were deeply impressed to see women participating in all aspects of public life. We saw female physicians, female lawyers, female judges, female factory directors, female train drivers, female actors, female trade union leaders; all kinds of careers have been opened up for them. In the factories, we saw young female workers mastering giant machines. In the educational sector, we saw women leading universities and various schools. In agriculture, the productivity of women has been valued. In a vegetable cooperative in Nanjing, the most outstanding member was a 19-year-old girl. In the Hall of Glory of the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace, the number of model female workers was at least equal to the number of male workers, and their ages ranged from teenagers to over fifty years old. Considering that just five years ago, women were still bound by feudal laws and customs, this is truly an amazing achievement. With the complete liberation of women, the special needs of female workers are carefully taken care of. Pregnancy is no longer a terrible thing. Various facilities have been established everywhere for the welfare of mothers and infants. Female workers will no longer be sacrificed due to their gender, which is a stark contrast compared to capitalist countries, where women are exploited as cheap labor. Britain is proud of its decades of parliamentary politics, boasting that it is the "mother of parliaments." As far as I know, Britain has had only one female minister and a very small number of female members of parliament for many years. At the First National People's Congress in China, we saw three female ministers and many female representatives holding senior administrative positions. If proof is needed, then this is proof of the complete equality between men and women in New China.

    For visitors, New China is a miracle. The speed of construction is amazing. Workers do not wait for modern equipment; they use their hands to do the work that can be accelerated by machines tomorrow. Equally astonishing is that national problems are being solved on a broad scale, such as eradicating illiteracy, national health, water management, land reclamation, etc. In just a few years, China has swept away centuries of garbage. Mass education in hygiene and health has been promoted, night schools and crash literacy classes have eradicated illiteracy, many huge reservoirs and canals have been built, the disasters of floods have been eradicated, and tens of thousands of trees have been planted to prevent soil erosion and reclaim wasteland. The People's Government spares no effort in planning and building a happy, healthy, and prosperous New China. Those guests who harbored regret for the old China left New China with great admiration for the new China.

    I left China with deep love and respect for the Chinese people. A new century has been born, and China is taking its rightful place among the world's peace-loving great nations. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese women and wish them greater success in their future tasks. I join them in shouting: "Long live world peace!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    应邀访问我国的外国朋友发表访华观感
    印度全国工会大会总书记
    最近应邀访问中国的印度全国工会大会总书记、印度国会议员特里帕蒂十月二十六日回到印度。特里帕蒂说，他看见中国工人阶级有真正的民主。
    特里帕蒂说，在中国，工资正日益增加，购买力和物价是平衡的。他认为，中国的土地改革和妇女解放是它的最显著的成就；他说，中华人民共和国政府享有广大人民群众的强有力的支持。
    印度妇女代表团
    应中华全国民主妇女联合会的邀请在中国作了四周访问后返回印度的、以印度国会议员安穆·斯瓦米纳坦为首的印度妇女代表团向报界发表关于访华观感的声明。
    声明中说：“在十月一日，我们参观了庄严的检阅，在检阅结束后，我们不禁深深为参加检阅的人民群众——代表着新中国人民生活的许多方面的工人、学生、家庭妇女、文化界、教育界和艺术团体——的欢欣、出于自发的行动和热情所感动。这次游行的本身就表明了在过去几年中为了建设一个更健康、更幸福的中国所发挥出来的伟大力量和魄力。”
    声明在谈到中国妇女的解放时说：“我们都听到过中国妇女解放的情形，而我们在实际生活中所见到的充分证实了这种情况。我们在中国妇女身上发现了尊严和美、能干和镇静及民族自豪感的优美的结合。”
    声明指出：使代表团团员们非常感动的是中国人民从幼年到老年享受到的福利——这是国家关心的主要问题之一——和各种卫生措施、人民的热情以及“事业成就感”。
    声明对代表团团员在中国受到的热情的友谊和殷勤的款待表示深切的感谢，并表示希望中印两国妇女能努力促进世界和平的事业。
    英中友好协会工会代表团
    应中国人民对外文化协会邀请来中国访问的英中友好协会工会代表团，在回到伦敦后，于十月二十九日发表声明说：代表团对于“中国人民真诚希望和平”这一点有着深刻的印象。
    声明说：代表们认为，中国应该得到它在联合国中的正当地位。
    声明谈到中国在经济建设方面所取得的巨大成就。它指出：建设的规模和速度、工业的发展和生产方面的巨大进展，给了代表团人员以很深的印象。声明说：“生产方面的巨大进展已经在工资、劳动和生活条件以及福利事业方面大大提高了中国工人和农民的生活水平。”
    南非联邦妇女代表
    应中华全国民主妇女联合会邀请前来参加我国国庆观礼的南非联邦妇女代表、南非对苏和平友好协会书记莫利·费希尔夫人在三十日离开北京回国。
    莫利·费希尔夫人在我国期间，曾到沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、南京、上海和杭州等地参观访问。
    她在离开中国前夕致函中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅。信里说：
    在我们访问各大城市的长途旅行中，到处都看到妇女们参加各方面公共生活，这给我们很深的印象。我们看到了女医师、女律师、女法官、女厂长、女火车司机、女演员、女工会领导者，各种事业都为她们开了大门。在工厂中我们看见年轻的女工们掌握着巨型的机器。在教育界我们看见了妇女在领导着大学和各种学校。在农业中，妇女的生产力已被重视。在南京的一个蔬菜合作社中，最优秀的社员是一个十九岁的女青年。在上海工人文化宫的光荣厅中，模范女工的数目至少和男工的数目相等，她们的年龄是从十几岁一直到五十多岁。当我们想到在短短的五年前妇女还被封建法律和习俗束缚时，这真是一个惊人的成就。随着妇女们的彻底解放，女工们的特殊要求受到细心的照顾。怀孕再也不是可怕的事了。到处为母婴的福利建立了各种设施。女工再也不会由于性别而受到牺牲，和资本主义国家比较起来，实在是一个强烈的对照，在那些国家里妇女是作为廉价的劳动力而受到剥削的。英国对于他们几十年来的议会政治感到骄傲，吹嘘地说它是“议会之母”。据我所知道，许多年来英国只有一个女大臣，和极少数的女议员。在中国第一届全国人民代表大会上，我们看到有三个女部长和许多担任高级行政职务的女代表。如果需要证明的话，那么这就是新中国男女完全平等的证据。
    对访问者来说，新中国是一个奇迹。建设的速度实在惊人。工人们不等待现代化的设备，他们用双手来干明日能用机器加速完成的工作。同样惊人的是全国性的问题都在广泛的规模上解决了，例如：扫除文盲、国民健康、治水、开荒等问题。在短短的几年中，中国已经扫除了几百年的垃圾。推行了卫生和健康的群众教育，夜校和速成识字班扫除了文盲，建筑了许多巨大的蓄水库和运河，根绝了洪水的灾害，种植了成千成万的树木以防止土壤浸蚀并开垦荒地。人民政府不遗余力地在计划和建立一个幸福、健康、繁荣的新中国。那些怀着惋惜旧中国的心情的来宾都抱着对新中国有极大的敬仰的心情离开了新中国。
    我怀着对于中国人民深挚的友爱和崇敬离开了中国。一个新的世纪诞生了，中国在全世界爱好和平的大国里正在占有它的应得的地位。我谨向中国妇女深致谢意并祝她们在未来的任务中获得更大的成功。我和她们一起高呼：“世界和平万岁！”（据新华社讯）
