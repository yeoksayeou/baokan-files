Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: The national state-owned electric power industry again exceeded its October production plan. The total output value exceeded by 2.5 percent, power generation exceeded by 0.9 percent, and major technical and economic indicators such as coal consumption and plant power consumption rate also exceeded the plan. Due to the reduction in coal consumption, more than 3,500 tons of standard coal were saved; the plant power saved by the power plants themselves, if used for steelmaking, could produce more than 2,700 tons of steel.

    Most electric power units across the country took advantage of the low load period before and after the National Day to generally carry out equipment maintenance and line cleaning, and some power plants also conducted full-load tests on their units, which played an important role in ensuring safe operation and the completion of the production plan.

    The national electric power system is currently actively preparing to meet the peak load periods of this winter and next spring.

    全国国营电力工业超额完成上月生产计划
    【新华社十三日讯】全国国营电力工业又超额完成十月份生产计划。计生产总值超额百分之二点五，发电量超额百分之零点九，主要技术经济指标如煤耗、厂用电率等也都超额完成。由于煤耗降低而节省的标准煤达三千五百多吨；发电厂自己节省下来的厂用电如果用来炼钢，可以炼出二千七百多吨钢。
    全国各地电业单位，大部利用国庆节前后的低负荷期间普遍进行了设备的检修和线路清扫工作，部分发电厂还做了机组的满负荷试验，对保证运行安全和生产计划的完成起了重要的作用。
    全国电业系统目前正在积极做好迎接今年冬季和明年春季电力高峰负荷时期的准备工作。
