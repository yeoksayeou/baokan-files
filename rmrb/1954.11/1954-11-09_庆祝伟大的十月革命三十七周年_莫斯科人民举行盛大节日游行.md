Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: According to TASS, after the military parade on Red Square on November 7th, the working people of Moscow began a grand festival parade.

    The sound of the firm steps of the reviewed troops had just died down when the marching masses poured into Red Square. Cheering, they passed before the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum, paying tribute to Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Pospelov, Suslov, and Shatalin. The leaders of the Party and the government shouted to the paraders: "Long live the unbreakable unity between the Party, the government, and the people!"

    Red Square looked like a colorful carpet, with silk flags, flowers, and banners intertwined. Banners reporting labor achievements were held high above the heads of the paraders. The simple and straightforward numbers on the banners held by steelworkers, textile workers, machine-building workers, food workers, and other workers in Moscow vividly illustrated the achievements of the Soviet people's heroic peaceful construction labor.

    Among the workers' teams from the proletarian district, the workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory led the way. Today was a particularly happy and memorable day for them: thirty years ago, during the parade celebrating the October Revolution, the workers of this factory drove ten trucks at the head of the automobile workers' team. These were the first batch of automobiles made entirely of domestic materials and by the Soviet people themselves. Now, this factory has become a giant in the Soviet machine-building industry, producing powerful trucks, buses, small cars, and various daily necessities. Joining the workers of the Stalin Automobile Factory in the parade were a group of Chinese interns who will participate in the work of China's first automobile factory.

    The teams of workers from Moscow's consumer goods industry and construction industry marched past Red Square with their production achievements. The products of Moscow's textile factories, shoe factories, and other light industrial enterprises are famous throughout the country, and the workers of these enterprises overfulfilled their production plans by 1 billion rubles this year. Thanks to the selfless labor of construction workers, Moscow has built 20 new schools and over-fulfilled the plan by constructing 500,000 square meters of housing in the first ten months of this year.

    The parade continued to pour into Red Square. Among them were famous scientists, writers, actors, artists, teachers, and university students.

    Youth from the reclaimed areas also participated in the festival parade with the people of Moscow. Together with hundreds of thousands of Soviet patriots, they carried out the glorious task put forward by the Party and the government, reclaiming 17 million hectares of new land this year.

    The parade held many propaganda posters and various banners. One banner read the first decree of the Soviet regime—the Decree on Peace. Many banners read peace and friendship.

    The parade held high portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, portraits of the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, and the slogans of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party celebrating the October Revolution.

    The parade held high portraits of the leaders of fraternal countries such as the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    A group of young people held a banner that read: "For the sake of world peace, may the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and India develop and consolidate day by day."

    The working people of Moscow paid tribute to the German peace forces who are opposing the evil plan to turn West Germany into a breeding ground for the Third World War. They also paid tribute to the Japanese people who were heroically fighting for national independence, for the democratic development of their motherland, against the revival of Japanese militar

    庆祝伟大的十月革命三十七周年
    莫斯科人民举行盛大节日游行
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一月七日，在红场上举行的阅兵式结束后，莫斯科劳动人民就开始了盛大的节日游行。
    检阅部队的坚强步伐声刚刚静下来，群众游行的队伍就涌入了红场。他们欢呼着，从列宁斯大林陵墓前走过，向布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、波斯伯洛夫、苏斯洛夫和夏塔林致敬。党和政府的领导人向游行者高呼：“党、政府和人民之间的牢不可破的团结万岁！”
    红场像一幅五颜六色的地毡，丝质的旗帜、鲜花和标语牌交织成一片。报告劳动成绩的横旗高高举在游行者的头上。莫斯科的炼钢工人、纺织工人、机器制造工人、食品工人和其他各业工人所举的标语牌上的朴实简单的数字，鲜明地说明了苏联人民英雄的和平建设劳动的成果。
    在无产阶级区的工人队伍中，走在最前头的是斯大林汽车工厂的工人。今天是他们特别高兴、特别有纪念意义的日子：三十年前，在庆祝十月革命的游行中，这个工厂的工人们驾驶着十辆卡车走在汽车工人队伍的前面。这是第一批全部用国产的材料并由苏联人自己亲手制造出来的汽车。而现在，这个工厂已成为苏联机器制造业中的巨型工厂，生产着马力强大的卡车、公共汽车、小型汽车和各种日用品。和斯大林汽车工厂的工人一起参加游行的还有一批中国实习生，他们将参加中国第一个汽车工厂的工作。
    莫斯科的日用品工业和建筑业工人的队伍带着生产成绩走过红场。莫斯科各纺织工厂、制鞋厂和其他轻工业企业的产品是全国闻名的，这些企业的工人今年超计划生产了价值十亿卢布的各种产品。由于建筑工人的忘我劳动，今年头十个月莫斯科已新建了二十所学校，并超计划建筑了五十万平方公尺的房屋。
    游行队伍不断地涌入红场。其中有著名的科学家、作家、演员、艺术家、教师和高等学校的学生。
    从开垦地区前来的青年也和莫斯科人一起参加节日的游行。他们和成千成万的苏联爱国者一道，执行了党和政府所提出的光荣任务，在今年开垦了
  一千七百万公顷的新地。
    游行队伍举着许多宣传画和各种标语牌。有一块标语牌上写着苏维埃政权的第一个法令——和平法令。许多标语牌上写着和平和友谊。
    游行队伍中高举着马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的画像，高举着苏联共产党和政府领导人的画像，高举着苏联共产党中央委员会庆祝十月革命节的口号。
    游行队伍高举着中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国等兄弟国家的领袖的画像。
    一批青年举着标语牌，上面写着：“为了世界和平的利益，祝苏联和印度两国人民的友谊和合作日益发展和巩固。”
    莫斯科的劳动人民向正在反对把西德变成第三次世界大战的温床的罪恶计划的德国和平力量致敬。他们还向正在英勇地争取民族独立、争取祖国的民主发展、反对日本军国主义复活、反对把日本变成帝国主义在远东的军事跳板的日本人民致敬。
    游行队伍中可以看到各国兄弟共产党和工人党的领袖的画像。
    群众游行历时数小时。走在后面的是运动员的队伍，他们举着鲜艳的锦旗前进。
    莫斯科劳动人民的游行鲜明地证明了苏联人民、共产党和苏联政府的牢不可破的团结一致，证明了苏维埃国家创造力量的蓬勃壮大。
