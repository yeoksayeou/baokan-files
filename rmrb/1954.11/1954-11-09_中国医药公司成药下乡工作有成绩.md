The China National Pharmaceutical Company system has achieved considerable success in its work of delivering prepared medicines to the countryside through state-owned department stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other channels. Currently, 9,962 grassroots cooperatives, 306 county department stores, and 278 trading companies across the country are engaged in the business of prepared medicines. In Hebei Province, 80% of the grassroots cooperatives in counties such as Luanxian, Changli, Leting, and Funing are engaged in the business of prepared medicines. In Guangxi Province, 803 grassroots cooperatives, accounting for 99.1% of the total number of cooperatives, are engaged in the business of prepared medicines. In Shandong Province, 889 grassroots cooperatives have established pharmaceutical retail outlets. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Rizhao County, Shandong Province, and Jixian County, Hebei Province, have even equipped themselves with dozens of doctors who also provide medical treatment. This has appropriately alleviated some of the difficulties of shortage of doctors and medicines in the countryside, enabling many farmers to receive timely treatment for their illnesses. In flood-stricken areas, prepared medicines have played an even more significant role in treating lower limb ulcers, malaria, dysentery, and other diseases.

In carrying out the work of delivering prepared medicines to the countryside, state-owned pharmaceutical companies and health administration departments in many regions have paid attention to training salespersons, solving technical problems in operation. Currently, 2,918 salespersons engaged in the business of prepared medicines have been trained in various localities, promoting the development of the work of department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities in managing prepared medicines.

The quantity of prepared medicines managed by supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities has gradually increased. In 1953, the prepared medicines managed by the national cooperative system accounted for only 2.4% of the total sales of pharmaceutical companies, but in the third quarter of this year, it has risen to 6.98%. The prepared medicines sold by the supply and marketing cooperatives in Wendeng Prefecture, Shandong Province, account for 50% of the total sales of the local pharmaceutical company each month. The quantity of medicines sold by state-owned department stores in various localities is also very large. In provinces such as Sichuan and Jiangsu, the medicines sold by pharmaceutical companies through department stores account for more than 30% of the total sales of pharmaceutical companies. Guangxi Province, according to the principle of division of labor between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives in urban and rural areas, has determined that grassroots cooperatives should purchase goods from local department stores, which has overcome the difficulty of the limited number of pharmaceutical company organizations and promoted the development of the work of delivering prepared medicines to the countryside. At an internal material exchange meeting convened by the Provincial Cooperative Bureau in October, the Guangxi Provincial Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Company assisted them in connecting their plans and signed supply and sales contracts for the fourth quarter, resulting in a transaction of 13.3 billion yuan at one time, of which the experienced prescription medicines approved by the Ministry of Health accounted for more than 60%.

    中国医药公司成药下乡工作有成绩
    中国医药公司系统通过国营百货公司、供销合作社等开展的成药下乡工作，已有不少成绩。目前，全国有九千九百六十二个基层合作社、三百零六个县百货商店及二百七十八个贸易公司已经经营成药。河北省滦县、昌黎、乐亭、抚宁等县已有百分之八十的基层合作社经营成药；广西省已经有八百零三个基层合作社经营成药，占总社数的百分之九十九点一；山东省基层合作社设立医药门市部的有八百八十九处。山东省日照县和河北省冀县的供销合作社还配备了几十个医生兼代治病。这就适当地解决了目前农村缺医少药的一些困难，使不少农民的疾病得到了及时的治疗；在水灾地区，成药对治疗下肢溃疡、疟疾、痢疾等病症起了更加显著的作用。
    在开展成药下乡的工作中，许多地区的国营医药公司和卫生行政部门注意训练了营业员，解决了经营技术上的问题。目前，各地已训练了二千九百一十八名经营成药的营业员，推动了各地百货公司、供销合作社经营成药工作的开展。
    各地供销合作社经营成药的数量逐渐增加。一九五三年全国合作社系统经营的成药，仅占医药公司销货总额的百分之二点四，今年第三季度已上升为占百分之六点九八。山东省文登专区供销合作社每月销售的成药，已占当地医药公司销货总额的百分之五十。各地国营百货公司销售的药品数量也很大。四川、江苏等省医药公司通过百货公司销售的药品，已占医药公司销货总额的百分之三十以上。广西省按国营商业和供销合作社城乡分工的原则，确定基层合作社向当地百货公司进货，这就克服了医药公司机构不普遍的困难，促进了成药下乡工作的开展；十月间在该省合作局召开的一次内部物资交流会上，中国医药公司广西省公司协助他们把计划衔接在一起，并签订了第四季度的供销合同，结果一次成交一百三十三亿元，其中卫生部核定的经验方成药占百分之六十以上。
