    For Socialist Industrialization
    — A Record of the Xingyang County Party Representatives' Meeting Discussing the Work of Unified Purchase and Sales
    Yang Hongtao

    I heard that the scope of unified purchase and sales has expanded this year. Some Party members and cadres in Xingyang County, Henan Province, couldn't understand it. They didn't understand that realizing industrialization is a long and arduous struggle, and even contrasted national construction with personal interests. They had more or less some opinions on the current market situation of supply falling short of demand, and their understanding of the unified purchase and sales policy was insufficient. Dong Yunxing, the secretary of the Chapian Township branch, thought this way: "The transition period will be almost over in three or five years." Therefore, he asked: "The 141 projects have already been supported twice, why should we support them now?" Some people even suspected: "Are we getting further and further away from socialism?" The Party members had these doubts in their hearts, so they couldn't answer the various questions raised by the masses, and they lacked confidence in completing this year's unified purchase and sales task. In response to this situation, the Xingyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of Party representatives to discuss the work of unified purchase and sales.

    Fan Changcun of Zhuchuan Township spoke at the meeting about the difficulties he had in building his family business and the real feeling of bitterness first and then sweetness. In order to build a new cave dwelling, his family had been mobilized by his uncle to save money for the past three years. The whole family lived frugally, without spending a penny of spare money. They only saved more than one million yuan in two years. His family used this money to dig the cave dwelling first, but they didn't have money to enclose the door and couldn't move in yet. Later, the whole family continued to save money to accumulate money until the door was enclosed. Now the whole family has moved into the new cave dwelling, and eating and sleeping are very comfortable. Others also talked about their families' hard lives of saving money for digging wells, building houses, and turning dry land into paddy fields. When everyone compared these things with national industrialization, they realized the hardship and long-term nature of industrial construction, and they also understood the reasons for temporary difficulties. Understanding these principles, everyone's enthusiasm for supporting national construction was increased, and they regarded building socialism as their own responsibility. Someone asked Guo Tianhe, who attended the meeting: "It will take many years to transition to a socialist society, when will we be able to live that life?" Guo Tianhe told him: "Socialism is in our hands. We are engaging in socialism now. If everyone works harder, the socialist society will come sooner."

    Everyone also used the changes in their own production to look at the relationship between industrialization and farmers. Everyone talked about the situation in Chapian Township. Since the year before last, Chapian Township has had seven-inch walking plows, which plow the land deeply and turn the soil smoothly; there are also weeding hoes, and one person using a weeding hoe is equal to the workload of three people using old hoes. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sales last year, the township has added four seven-inch walking plows, four weeding hoes, and seven waterwheels. This year, when planting autumn crops, there were also double-shared plows, and the use of double-shared plows was a further step forward than walking plows. From here, everyone clearly saw that the development of industry step by step gives more and more assistance to agriculture.

    However, when discussing this year's unified purchase and sales of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton, some Party members said: "The road is too narrow." Dong Yunxing talked about his family's living conditions in recent years. His family is in an area with more cotton production. Before liberation, after paying land rent every summer, there was only one stone of fine grain left, and when the trees sprouted in spring, they had to pick "elm money" from the elm trees to eat. When quilting cotton clothes, even black, moldy cotton batting the size of walnuts had to be patched in. He had to borrow clothes from others when he got married. After liberation, he was given land, and his family's living standards greatly improved. Just talking about clothing, he had new cotton clothes, new cotton pants, fine cloth coats, lined and unlined, all of them. At first, he was worried when he heard about the unified purchase and sales of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton. At a group meeting, through recollection and comparison, he realized that his life had greatly improved, but production had not increased so quickly. After the implementation of unified purchase and sales, is the road considered "narrow"? Dong Yunxing said: "The cloth supplied by the state to our family is enough for the whole family to use. Last winter, grain was purchased in a unified way, and the standard of living was not reduced." During the discussion, everyone realized that practicing thrift is beneficial to the development of production. Zhang Laogen, the secretary of the Zhangcun Township Party branch, said: "Our cooperative has a big pig. The members wanted to slaughter it and eat it themselves during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but they didn't think about the fact that the cooperative's waterwheel loan had not been repaid. Later, after discussion, everyone sold the pig to the state, repaid the loan, and supported industrial construction, and the members did not bear interest." Not long ago, this cooperative sold 4,500 jin of seed cotton, and then bought back 7,500 jin of soybean cake and 1,500 jin of bone meal. With fertilizer for wheat planting, they laid the foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year and repaid 6 million yuan of loans. Therefore, everyone realized that they should not only care about the present, but also increase production and practice thrift, and think about the next step in order to develop production and strive for greater prosperity.

    The branch secretaries who attended the meeting all believed that this meeting cleared up confused thoughts, clarified how to follow the socialist road, and also understood that our policies are reasonable. As long as we explain them carefully, the masses will support them; they also checked the reasons why they couldn't vigorously carry out propaganda in the past, mainly because they didn't study the policies well. Shi Xiude said: "Understanding these fundamental principles, we can publicize them to the farmers. In the past, our township always explained the work roughly, and couldn't stand a rebuttal from others; or we would say: 'This is an order, a policy,' or say: 'If you don't understand, go to the district.' That approach is wrong. We can't blame the masses for not understanding, we can only blame ourselves for not studying the policies thoroughly first, and not explaining the policies clearly to the masses. This time, we will use practical examples to publicize them, and patiently educate them, which will definitely raise the awareness of the farmers and complete the task."

    为了社会主义工业化
    ——记荥阳县党代表会议讨论统购统销工作
    杨洪涛
    听说今年统购统销的范围扩大了，河南省荥阳县的一部分党员、干部想不通，他们对实现工业化是个长期艰苦的奋斗过程不了解，甚至把国家建设和个人利益对立起来，对当前市场上出现的供不应求现象或多或少有些意见，对统购统销政策认识不足。插阎乡的支部书记董运兴就这样想：“过渡时期有个三、五年也就差不多了”，因此，他问：“一百四十一项工程已经支援过两次了，为什么现在还要支援呢？”有些人甚至怀疑：“是不是离社会主义越来越远了呢？”党员们心里有着这些疑虑，对于群众提出的各种问题也就解答不了，对于完成今年的统购统销任务信心不足。中共荥阳县委针对这种情况，召开党代表会议讨论统购统销工作。
    竹川乡范长存在会议上谈了他自己兴家立业的困难和先苦后甜的切实感觉。他家为了修个新窑洞，前三年叔父就动员大家节省，全家人省吃俭用，一个闲钱不花，两年才积余了一百多万元。他家用这些钱先打了窑洞，但是没有钱圈门，还不能搬进去。以后全家继续节省来积蓄钱，一直到把门圈起来了。现在全家人搬进了新窑洞，吃饭睡觉都很舒服。别的人也谈起了自己家为打井、盖房、旱地变水田而省吃俭用过艰苦日子的事情。大家用这些事情和国家工业化一比较，就认识到工业化建设的艰苦性和长期性，也明白了暂时受些困难的原因。懂得了这些道理，大家支援国家建设的热情提高了，把建设社会主义当成了自己的责任。有人问参加会议的郭天河：“过渡到社会主义社会还得好多年，咱啥时候才能过上呢？”郭天河就告诉他说：“社会主义就在咱们手里，现在咱们就在闹社会主义，大家努力大些，社会主义社会就来的早些。”
    大家又用自己生产上的变化来看工业化建设和农民的关系。大家谈起插阎乡的情况，从前年起，插阎乡里有了七吋步犁，犁地深，翻垡平；也有了耘锄，一个人使用耘锄等于使旧锄的三个人的工作量。自去年实行统购以来，全乡添了七吋步犁四张，耘锄四部，水车七架。今年种秋时，又有了双铧犁，使用双铧犁比步犁又进了一步。从这里大家很清楚地看到工业一步步的发展给农业的援助也就愈来愈多。
    但是讨论到今年的棉布统购统销和棉花的统购时，有些党员说：“路太窄了。”董运兴就谈了他这家几年的生活情况。他家在产棉较多的地区。解放以前，每年夏季除了缴地租外，只剩下一石多细粮，春天树木发芽时，就得捋榆树上的“榆钱”吃。絮棉衣时，核桃大的黑得发霉的棉套也要补进去。他结婚时还得借人家的衣服。解放以后，分了地，他家的生活水平大大提高，就说穿著吧，新棉衣、新棉裤、细布大衣、夹的、单的，都有了。最初，他听说棉布统购统销和棉花统购时，心里就嘀咕。在一次小组会上，通过回忆对比，他才明白了自己生活已经有了很大提高，但是生产并没有提高得这么快。实行统购统销以后，路算不算“窄”呢？董运兴说：“国家供应咱家的布够全家用了。去冬统购了粮食，生活没降低。”大家在讨论中，认识厉行节约对发展生产是有好处的。张村乡党支部书记张老根说：“俺社里有一条大猪，社员们要在中秋节时杀掉自己吃，就没有想到社里的水车贷款没有还，后来大家一商量就把猪卖给国家，贷款归还了，支援了工业建设，社员也不背利息。”不久前，这个社卖了四千五百斤籽棉，随即买回七千五百斤豆饼和一千五百斤牛骨粉，种麦有了肥料，为明年小麦丰产打下基础，归还了六百万元的贷款。因此，大家认识到不能光顾眼前，要增产节约，为下一步着想，才能发展生产，争取更大富裕。
    参加会议的支部书记们，都认为这次开会清除了糊涂思想，明白了社会主义道路怎样走法，也明白了我们的政策是合情合理的，只要细讲细算，群众就会拥护；也检查了过去不能大力开展宣传的原因，主要是没有好好学习政策。时修德说：“明白了这些根本道理，就能向农民宣传。过去俺乡作工作总是粗粗糙糙地讲一遍，经不起人家反问一句；要不就是说：‘这是命令、政策’，或者说：‘不通了你往区里’。那样作法是不对的。咱不能埋怨群众不通，只怪咱没先把政策学通，没有把政策向群众说清楚。这次回去拿实际事例宣传，耐心教育，就一定会提高农民觉悟完成任务。”
