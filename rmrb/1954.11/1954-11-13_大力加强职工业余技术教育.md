    In the process of restoring and developing industrial production in our country, the production technology level of the working masses is constantly improving. Some machines that China could not manufacture in the past can now be manufactured by ourselves. The number of new industrial products is increasing day by day, providing many necessary equipment for industrial and agricultural construction. At the same time, a large number of skilled workers have been trained, and a technical reserve force has been trained. However, according to the needs of our country's socialist industrialization, our technical level is still quite backward, and our technical strength, whether in terms of quantity, quality, or technical types, is far from meeting the needs of the ever-developing industrial production, basic construction, and transportation. The technical level of a large number of newly trained young skilled workers is still very low, and experienced old skilled workers have also encountered many new difficulties and new problems in mastering modern new technologies and new equipment. This is also an important reason for the current low quality, many accidents, and failure to fully complete national planned targets in industrial production and basic construction.
    In order to adapt to the needs of national production and construction, in addition to strengthening school education and training new specialized technical talents, strengthening on-the-job technical education for workers is one of the important methods to change the current backward technical situation in industrial production, basic construction, and transportation. In the past few years, many factories and mining enterprises have carried out some on-the-job technical education work in different ways and on different scales to solve the key problems and weak links in the current production technology of their enterprises, such as inviting Soviet experts to give technical lessons, popularizing certain advanced experiences, organizing workers to study drawings and technological regulations when trial-producing new products, organizing new and old workers to sign master-apprentice contracts, and holding exhibitions, technical observation performances, technical research conferences, and experience exchange meetings. Enterprises with larger scale and better conditions have established spare-time technical schools, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which once established a spare-time technical university. These different forms of on-the-job technical education have achieved certain results and have improved the technical level of workers to varying degrees, playing a positive role in ensuring the completion of national production and basic construction plans.
    However, there are also many problems in the current on-the-job technical education for workers. Some leading cadres of enterprises do not pay enough attention to this work. They only shout that there is a shortage of technical personnel and reach out to higher authorities for skilled workers and cadres, but they do not cultivate technical strength by strengthening technical education for workers. Although many enterprises have also carried out some on-the-job technical education work, they lack a regular and systematic education and training plan. Many enterprises only pay attention to training general skilled workers, but neglect the work of training senior skilled workers and training excellent skilled workers to become engineering and technical cadres. Some enterprises do not connect with the actual problems in production when carrying out on-the-job technical education, but only talk about empty theoretical knowledge. Some enterprises also do not adopt various forms to carry out on-the-job technical education in a realistic and practical manner according to needs and possibilities, but only simply emphasize standardization and systematization. As a result, either they cannot start it up, or they cannot persist in it even if they start it up. There are also many problems in organizational leadership. Some enterprises are led by administrative leaders, some are led by trade unions, and a few enterprises adopt a division of labor leadership by administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League. Some enterprises are even not responsible for it, forming a free-flowing situation. There are also some problems in the arrangement of teachers, teaching materials, and study time. In short, the current situation of on-the-job technical education for workers is still quite chaotic, and this situation must be improved.
    The on-the-job technical education work of enterprise workers must become a regular, most effective, and important method of cultivating and strengthening technical strength in close combination with production. It is a long-term and regular task of the enterprise departments. At present, the number of new workers in enterprises has increased significantly, production tasks are becoming increasingly heavy, technical requirements are getting higher and higher, and the contradiction of technical backwardness has become increasingly prominent. If we do not quickly and effectively strengthen technical education, it will be impossible to improve the current serious situation of low quality and many accidents, and it will be impossible to produce a large number of new products to support national construction and supply the needs of the people. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, newly built and expanded enterprises need a large number of skilled technicians. Most of these technicians will rely on the support of existing enterprises. If we do not immediately strengthen technical education, it will inevitably affect the start of production of these new enterprises. The urgency of the problem lies here.
    Today, strengthening on-the-job technical education for enterprise workers has very favorable conditions. In the past few years, the management of enterprises has gradually embarked on the track of planned management, and the political awareness and cultural level of the working masses have been improved. Studying technology, improving technology, and mastering modern new technology are their common requirements. Engineering and technical personnel are generally positive about this work. As long as they are mobilized, they will enthusiastically participate. We have gained certain experience in on-the-job technical education in the past, and we also have a certain organizational foundation. Therefore, it is not only necessary but also fully possible to widely carry out and strengthen on-the-job technical education for workers at present.
    What issues should be addressed to strengthen on-the-job technical education for workers?
    First, we must strengthen the organizational leadership of on-the-job technical education for workers and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for this work. The party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in enterprises must attach importance to this work. The party committee meetings should discuss how to do this work well and make corresponding resolutions to conscientiously implement them. In specific work, the technical training courses that are planned to improve workers' scientific and technological theoretical knowledge, solve a major technical problem in production operation, and study the technological regulations of new products and the operating procedures of new equipment should be specifically organized and led by the enterprise administration. Not only should a technical education plan be formulated, the learning progress should be determined, and the learning time should be guaranteed. The phenomenon of excessive meetings in enterprises has not yet been eliminated, and the time for workers' extracurricular activities is often encroached upon. This situation must be corrected. At the same time, the enterprise administration should also solve specific problems such as teachers, teaching materials, teaching tools, teaching places, and education funds, designate special personnel to be responsible, stipulate learning systems, and stipulate the standards for assessing learning results in accordance with professional and technical standards to ensure the implementation of the technical education plan. In on-the-job technical education, we should pay attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, especially the teaching plans, teaching outlines, and teaching materials of the Soviet Union in the training of technicians. The trade union and the Communist Youth League should closely cooperate, do a good job in the ideological mobilization of the masses, ensure that students persist in learning, and should also help teachers improve teaching methods, organize students to exchange learning experiences, educate students to abide by learning discipline, give praise and encouragement to those with excellent teaching results, and report the organization of learning and the ideological situation of workers to the party committee in a timely manner and put forward suggestions for improving teaching. The party committee should check the implementation of the technical education plan at certain meetings.
    For organizing workers to exchange production experience, observe performances, visit exhibitions, discuss technical research issues, give technical lectures, and all other technical publicity work that is sufficient to improve workers' technical level, the trade union should be responsible for specific organizational leadership, and the administration and the Communist Youth League should give strong support and assistance in practical work. The on-the-job technical education for workers in small and medium-sized enterprises scattered in cities should be carried out by the industrial administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues at the municipal level.
    Secondly, the orientation of on-the-job technical education should be clearly stipulated, that is, to combine with production and with the existing problems in current production technology and the technical innovation movement. We advocate doing what we learn. Therefore, on-the-job technical education must face all workers, and should start with popularization, and improve on the basis of popularization. For workers with higher cultural level and technical level, we should focus on training. Enterprises with conditions can run more formal spare-time technical schools to learn general technical basic courses. For professional and technical workers, business learning can be organized according to professional workshops or working sections, or temporary training courses can be held. For the majority of workers, we must conduct various technical education according to the needs of production development, focusing on the key issues and weak links in production, promote effective advanced experience, organize advanced producers of different types of work to report experience, and make technical performances, organize the majority of workers to observe the actual production operations of advanced producers or advanced workshop groups by type of work, and organize mass scientific and technological lectures and exhibitions to introduce relevant technical books and periodicals.
    For workers with a certain technical level, they can also be organized to learn the second technology or learn similar technologies according to the needs of enterprise production development. This not only helps to improve the technical level, but also prepares a sufficient technical reserve force for enterprises without increasing the establishment, which is directly beneficial to production.
    Finally, to carry out on-the-job technical education for workers, we must mobilize social forces and appropriately solve certain specific problems. For example, after workers reach a certain technical level in learning technology, although they cannot be promoted immediately, they must be given necessary encouragement. Some necessary systems should be established in this regard. At the same time, we must try to compile and translate learning books and materials for technicians and engineering and technical personnel in different technical categories to supply the needs of workers in various industrial sectors. In addition to translating Soviet teaching materials, we can also organize some people with practical production experience to compile some easy-to-understand extracurricular technical readings to meet the needs of the majority of workers. The Science Popularization Association and the electro-education department have done a lot of work in popularizing technical science propaganda in the past, and they should also strengthen cooperation in the future, make certain advanced technical operations into movies and show them to workers. This is the most practical and effective education method. Holding popular science and technology exhibitions of different sizes is also very effective, and we must carry them out in a more planned way in the future. In addition, the Academy of Sciences and various industrial, mining and transportation colleges can also consider setting up correspondence departments, under the conditions, to provide engineering and technical personnel and workers in enterprises with help in scientific and technological knowledge and answer the questions they raise. This will not only help combine the teaching and production practice of higher technical schools, but also help on-the-job technical learning for workers, and may make the content of teaching research more abundant.
    Strengthening on-the-job technical education for workers and improving the technical level is an urgent task at present. All relevant departments and enterprises should give full attention to it, check and summarize the experience of on-the-job technical education in their departments in the past few years, earnestly rectify and consolidate the existing various forms of on-the-job technical education work, and determine the plan and direction for carrying out this work in the future, and carry out this work in a down-to-earth manner with a plan and step by step.

    大力加强职工业余技术教育
    我国在恢复和发展工业生产的过程中，职工群众的生产技术水平是在不断地提高着。过去我国不能制造的机器，有些现在已经能够自己制造了。新的工业产品日渐增多，为工农业的建设提供了许多必要的设备。同时也培养了大量的技术工人，训练了技术后备力量。但是，根据我国社会主义工业化事业的需要来看，我们的技术水平还是相当落后的，我们的技术力量无论在数量上、质量上、技术种类上，都远远不能满足日益发展着的工业生产、基本建设和交通运输上的需要。大量新培养的青年技术工人技术水平还很低，有经验的老技术工人在掌握现代化的新技术、新设备方面也遇到了许多新的困难和新的问题。这也是目前工业生产和基本建设中质量低、事故多、不能全面完成国家计划指标的重要原因。
    为了适应国家生产和建设的需要，除了加强学校教育、培养新的专门技术人才以外，加强职工业余技术教育，是改变当前工业生产、基本建设和交通运输业中技术落后状况的重要方法之一。几年来，许多厂矿企业都以不同方式和不同规模进行过一些业余技术教育工作，以解决本企业在当前生产技术上的关键问题和薄弱环节，如请苏联专家讲技术课，推广某种先进经验，试制新产品时组织职工学习图纸和工艺规程，组织新老工人签订师徒合同，以及举办展览会、技术观摩表演会、技术研究会、经验交流会等。规模较大条件较好的企业举办了业余技术学校，如鞍山钢铁公司曾举办了业余技术大学。这些不同方式的业余技术教育，都取得了一定的成绩，在不同程度上提高了职工的技术水平，对保证国家生产和基本建设计划的完成起了积极的作用。
    但是，目前职工业余技术教育工作中也存在着不少问题。有些企业的领导干部对这一工作很不重视，他们光是喊叫技术力量不足，伸手向上级要技术工人和干部，却不从加强职工技术教育方面来培养技术力量。许多企业虽然也进行了一些业余技术教育工作，但缺乏经常的系统的教育培养计划。许多企业只是注意培养一般的技术工人，却放松了培养高级技术工人和培养优秀技术工人成为工程技术干部的工作。有些企业在进行业余技术教育时不联系生产中的实际问题，而只是讲些空洞的理论知识。也有某些企业不根据需要和可能，采取各种形式实事求是地进行业余技术教育，却只单纯地强调正规化和系统化，其结果不是办不起来，就是办起来了不能坚持下去。在组织领导上的问题也不少。有的企业是行政领导，有的企业则由工会领导，有个别企业采取行政、工会、青年团分工领导。有些企业甚至无人负责，形成自流。至于教员、教材、学习时间的安排，也都存在着一些问题。总之，目前职工业余技术教育的情况还是相当混乱的，这种状况必须设法加以改进。
    企业职工的业余技术教育工作，在密切结合生产的情况下，必须成为培养和壮大技术力量的经常的最有效的重要方法，它是企业部门的一项长期的经常的任务。而在目前，企业中新工人大量增加，生产任务日趋繁重，技术要求愈来愈高，技术落后的矛盾已愈来愈突出，我们如果不迅速有效地加强技术教育，就将不可能改善目前质量低、事故多的这种严重情况，就将不可能生产出大量的新产品，以支援国家建设和供应人民的需要。在第一个五年计划期间，新建扩建企业需要大量熟练技工，这些技工大部分将依靠现有企业的支援，我们如果不立即加强技术教育，势必影响这些新建企业的投入生产。问题的迫切性就在这里。
    今天加强企业职工的业余技术教育是有十分有利条件的。几年来企业管理工作已逐渐走上计划管理的轨道，职工群众的政治觉悟和文化水平都已有提高，学习技术、提高技术、掌握现代化的新技术，已是他们的共同要求。工程技术人员对这方面的工作一般的也都是积极的，只要加以动员，他们是会热情地参加的。我们过去已经取得了业余技术教育的一定的经验，也有一定的组织基础。因此，目前广泛开展和加强职工业余技术教育，不仅有必要，也是有充分的可能的。
    加强职工业余技术教育应注意解决那些问题呢？
    首先，必须加强职工业余技术教育的组织领导工作，消除对这一工作无人负责的现象。企业中党的、行政的、工会和青年团的组织必须重视这个工作。在党的会议上应讨论如何做好这个工作，并做出相应的决议，认真贯彻执行。在具体工作中，属于有计划地提高职工科学技术理论知识，解决生产操作上某一重大技术问题，为学习新产品的工艺规程和新设备的操作规程而开办的技术训练班，应由企业行政负责给予具体的组织领导；不仅应制订技术教育计划，确定学习进度，保证学习时间。现在企业中会议过多的现象仍未消除，职工业余活动时间经常被侵占，这种情况必须纠正。同时企业行政还应解决教员、教材、教学工具、教学场所、教育经费等具体问题，指定专人负责，规定学习制度，按照专业技术标准，规定学习成绩考核的标准，以保证技术教育计划的贯彻执行。在业余技术教育上要注意学习苏联先进经验，特别是苏联在技工培养方面的教学计划，教学大纲和教材。工会和青年团应密切配合，做好群众的思想动员工作，保证学员们坚持学习。工会和青年团还应帮助教员改进教学方法，组织学员交流学习经验，教育学员遵守学习纪律，给教学成绩优良的以表扬和鼓励，并向党委及时汇报组织学习情况和职工思想情况，提出改进教学的意见。党委应在一定会议上检查执行技术教育计划的情况。
    对于组织职工交流生产经验，观摩表演，参观展览，座谈技术研究问题，讲演技术课题，以及其他一切足以提高职工技术水平的技术宣传工作，都应该由工会负具体的组织领导责任，行政和青年团应在实际工作中给以大力支持和协助。对城市中分散的小型企业职工的业余技术教育工作应由市一级的工业行政部门、工会和青年团负责进行。
    其次，应该明确规定业余技术教育的方针，这就是和生产相结合，和当前生产技术上存在的问题、技术革新运动相结合。我们提倡做什么学什么。因此，业余技术教育必须面对全体职工，应从普及着手，在普及的基础上提高。对于文化水平和技术水平较高的职工应重点培养，有条件的企业可举办较正规的业余技术学校，学习一般的技术基础课程。对于专业技术工人，可按专业车间或工段组织业务学习，或举办临时训练班。对于广大职工则必须根据生产发展的需要，围绕生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节，进行多种多样的技术教育，推广有成效的先进经验，组织不同工种的先进生产者报告经验，并作技术表演，按工种组织广大工人观摩先进生产者或先进车间小组的实际生产操作，组织群众性的科学技术讲座和展览会，介绍有关的技术书刊。
    对于有一定技术水平的职工，也可以根据企业生产发展的需要，组织他们学习第二种技术，学习性质相近的技术，这不仅有助于技术水平的提高，并为企业在不增加定员的情况下准备了充足的技术后备力量，这是直接有利于生产的。
    最后，开展职工业余技术教育必须动员社会力量，适当地解决某些具体问题。例如职工在学习技术方面达到一定的技术等级水平后，虽然不能马上晋级，也须给以必要的鼓励。在这方面要建立一些必要的制度。同时要设法编译不同技术门类的技工和工程技术人员的学习书刊、材料，以供应各产业部门职工的需要。除翻译苏联教材以外，还可组织一些有实际生产经验的人，编写一些通俗易懂的业余技术读物，以满足广大职工的需要。科学普及协会和电化教育部门过去在普及技术科学的宣传工作上做了许多工作，今后也应加强配合，把某些先进的技术操作拍成电影，给工人放映，这是最实际最有效的教育方法。举办不同规模的普及技术的展览会，也是很有效的，今后要更有计划地进行。另外，科学院和各工矿交通专门学院，在条件具备的情况下，还可以考虑设函授部门，给企业中的工程技术人员和工人以科学技术知识方面的帮助，并解答他们提出的问题。这样既有助于高等技术学校的教学和生产实践相结合，也有助于职工业余技术学习，可能使教学研究的内容更加丰富。
    加强职工的业余技术教育，提高技术水平，是当前一项迫不容缓的任务，各有关部门和企业都应给予充分的重视，检查和总结几年来本部门业余技术教育的经验，切实整顿和巩固现有各种形式的业余技术教育工作，并确定今后进行这个工作的计划和方向，实事求是地有计划有步骤地把这个工作开展起来。
