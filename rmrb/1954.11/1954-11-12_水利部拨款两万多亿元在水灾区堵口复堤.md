The Ministry of Water Resources has determined the policy for repairing breach closures and embankment restoration projects in flood-affected areas and is prepared to allocate over two trillion yuan in special funds for this purpose. Some funds have already begun to be distributed to various locations. The Ministry of Water Resources' policy for constructing breach closures and embankment restoration projects stipulates that this winter and next spring, general embankments will be restored to the standards before the 1954 flood season. Special emphasis will be placed on reinforcing individual embankments (particularly important sections of embankments protecting large areas of farmland and important cities), such as the Jingjiang Dyke in Hubei province in the Yangtze River basin, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Embankment, the left bank of the Han River, the right bank of the Dongjing River, the Wuwei Dyke in Anhui, the Jiangdi Dyke near Nanjing, the important embankments in the Dongting Lake area in Hunan and the Poyang Lake area in Jiangxi, and the northern bank of the Huai River within Anhui province in the Huai River basin, as well as the embankments in the flood storage area, the Qianli Dyke of the Daqing River in Hebei province, the western bank of the Ziya River, and the dike of the Grand Canal.

It is estimated that the length of the embankment lines to be repaired during this round of breach closing and embankment restoration projects is 25,000 kilometers, involving over 300 million cubic meters of earthwork.

The Ministry of Water Resources instructed all regions to strictly control the expenses for breach closure and embankment restoration, use them frugally, and combine them with disaster relief work by providing work as a form of relief. At present, all provinces are formulating plans based on this policy, and some areas have already started work.

    水利部拨款两万多亿元在水灾区堵口复堤
    水利部已确定遭受水灾地区修建堵口复堤工程的方针，并准备拨发堵口复堤专款两万多亿元，部分款项已开始拨发各地。水利部修建堵口复堤工程的方针中规定：今冬明春将一般堤防恢复到一九五四年汛期以前的标准，个别堤防（保护大面积农田和重要城市的特别重要的堤段）如长江流域的湖北荆江大堤、荆江分洪围堤、汉江左堤、东荆河右堤、安徽无为大堤、南京市附近江堤、湖南洞庭湖、江西鄱阳湖地区的重要堤防，和淮河流域的安徽境内的淮河北堤及蓄洪区堤防，河北省的大清河千里堤、子牙河西堤及南运河堤等，要进行重点加固。
    这次堵口复堤工程，估计修复的堤线长度有二万五千公里，土方达三亿多公方。
    水利部指示各地，必须严格控制堵口复堤经费，节约使用，并应结合救灾工作，以工代赈。现在各省正根据这一方针编制计划，有些地区已经陆续动工。
