Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 31st: Since October, state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private textile, cigarette, food, and match factories in Wuhan have saved a lot of industrial raw materials for the country. The cotton consumption of five factories in the textile industry system has decreased significantly. In the first half of October, the average cotton consumption per piece of cotton yarn decreased by 6.71 *jin* compared to January-September. The amount of tobacco leaves consumed per carton of cigarettes in the Universe, Dada, and Nanyang cigarette factories in early and mid-October was lower than the tobacco leaf consumption quota set for the fourth quarter, while maintaining the quality of the cigarettes. During the flood control period in Wuhan, Nanyang Cigarette Factory had used more than 40,000 *jin* of tobacco leaves beyond the plan. Now, the amount of tobacco used per carton of cigarettes is 2.46 *jin* lower than the national standard. It is estimated that the factory will produce more than 160 additional cartons of cigarettes with the tobacco leaves saved in the fourth quarter alone. Now, some workshops in textile factories and cigarette factories are very clean, and the cotton and tobacco leaves that fall on the ground are carefully picked up by the workers. Workers at the Fuxin Flour Mill and Wuhan Oil Mill have increased the output rate of flour and edible oil, and the successful trial use of wheat bran for brewing wine at the Wuhan Winery has also saved a large amount of wheat, sorghum, sesame, and rapeseed.

To save industrial raw materials, the leaders of these factories have conducted ideological education and technical organizational measures on saving raw materials for the employees. Factories such as Hankou No. 1 Textile Company and Nanyang Cigarette Factory have held exhibitions of production increase and saving charts and physical objects. Nanyang Cigarette Factory also organized employees to visit rural areas in the suburbs of Wuhan. In this way, the employees were educated on production increase and saving with concrete examples. Chu Binchang, an engineer at the Wuhan Match Factory, and Wang Fuxing, a worker, jointly improved the brake of the stem cutting machine, which solved the problem of uneven thickness of match stems, thus eliminating the phenomenon that more than 120,000 match stems were wasted every day in the past due to inconsistent specifications.

    武汉轻工业工厂为国家节约很多工业原料
    【新华社武汉三十一日电】武汉市国营、地方国营和公私合营的纺织、卷烟、食品和火柴制造工厂，十月份以来为国家节约了很多工业原料。纺织工业系统五个工厂的用棉量已经显著降低，十月上半月每件棉纱的用棉量平均比一至九月份降低了六点七一市斤；宇宙、大达、南洋等烟厂十月上、中旬每箱香烟耗用的烟叶，都比第四季度规定的烟叶耗用量降低，并且保证了香烟质量。南洋烟厂在武汉市防汛期间耗用的烟叶曾超出计划四万多市斤，现在每箱香烟用烟量比国家规定的标准还降低了二点四六市斤，预计这个厂仅用第四季度所节约的烟叶，就可多生产香烟一百六十多箱。现在，有些纺织工厂和卷烟工厂的部分车间十分洁净，落在地下的棉花、烟叶，都被工人们细心拣扫起来。福新面粉厂和武汉油厂的工人们提高面粉、食油的出品率和武汉酿酒厂试用麸皮酿酒成功等，也节约了大量小麦、高粱、芝麻和菜籽。
    这些工厂的领导上为了节约工业原料，都对职工们进行了节约原料的思想教育和技术组织措施。汉口第一纺织公司、南洋烟厂等工厂举办了增产节约图表、实物展览会，南洋烟厂还组织职工到武汉市郊农村访问。这样，用具体的事例，对职工进行了增产节约教育。武汉火柴厂工程师储宾昌和工人汪福兴等共同改进了切梗机的刹车，解决了火柴梗子粗细不一的问题，从而消除了过去每天有十二万多根火柴梗因规格不一造成浪费的现象。
