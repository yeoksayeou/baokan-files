Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The material well-being of the Soviet people is constantly improving. The real wages and monetary income of Soviet workers and peasants are increasing every year. In 1953, the total income of Soviet workers and farmers, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 13 percent compared to 1952. Due to measures such as raising state purchase prices for agricultural products, the cash income of collective farms increased by 45 percent compared to the past. As a result of continuous price reductions, the current price level in the Soviet Union is more than half of what it was in 1947. Goods that cost 1,000 rubles in 1947 now only cost 433 rubles.

In line with the growth of the people's purchasing power, the supply of daily necessities in the Soviet Union is increasing daily. For example, in the first half of this year, the retail sales of state and cooperative trade organizations increased by 21 percent compared to the same period last year (calculated at comparable prices). The output of consumer industrial products is also constantly increasing. In the first half of 1954, compared with the same period in 1953, wool fabrics increased by 19 percent, and silk fabrics increased by 57 percent. Other cotton fabrics, linen fabrics, and shoes have all greatly increased. In 1954, more than 14 billion rubles were allocated for the construction of food and consumer goods industrial enterprises, while last year's allocation was 7.6 billion rubles. Currently, the construction of food and consumer goods industrial enterprises is underway throughout the Soviet Union.

The improvement of the Soviet people's living conditions day by day is another sign of the improvement of the Soviet people's living standards. In the past few years after the war, residents in cities and workers' residential areas have gained a total of more than 183 million square meters of new housing construction area. In 1954, the state allocated 25.5 billion rubles for housing construction. Moscow will receive 900,000 square meters of new housing construction area this year. Cities and workers' residential areas in the Moscow region will build a total of 780,000 square meters of housing construction area this year.

The Soviet Union's health care system is developing rapidly. In the past three years alone, the number of doctors in the Soviet Ministry of Health system has increased by 30,000, and the number of medical personnel with secondary education has increased by 70,000. There are now a total of nearly 300,000 doctors and nearly 900,000 medical personnel with secondary education in the Soviet Union. There are more than 2,000 sanatoriums, more than 350 summer resorts, and countless rest homes in scenic locations. More than 5 million working people have taken vacations in these areas this year.

    苏联人民的物质福利一天比一天提高
    【新华社莫斯科讯】苏联人民物质福利不断提高。苏联工农业劳动者每年的实际工资和货币收入都在增加。一九五三年苏联职工和农民的总收入，按比较价格计算，比一九五二年增加了百分之十三。由于采取了提高国家收购农产品价格等措施，集体农庄的现金收入比过去增加了百分之四十五。由于不断减低物价的结果，现在苏联的物价水平比一九四七年减低了一半多。一九四七年要一千卢布才能买到的东西，现在只要四百三十三卢布就可以买到。
    和人民的购买力增长相适应，苏联日用品的供应量逐日增加。例如，今年上半年国家和合作社贸易机关的零售额比去年同一时期增加了百分之二十一（按比较价格计算）。日用工业品的产量也不断增加。一九五四年上半年和一九五三年同期相比，毛织品增加了百分之十九，丝织品增加了百分之五十七。其他棉织品、线织品和鞋类都大大增加。一九五四年用于建设食品和日用品工业企业的拨款在一百四十亿卢布以上，而去年的拨款是七十六亿卢布。现在，苏联各地都在进行建设食品工业和日用品工业企业的工作。
    苏联人民的居住条件一天比一天改善，这是苏联人民生活水平提高的又一标志。城市和工人住宅区的居民在战后几年内，共获得了建筑面积达一亿八千三百多万平方公尺的新住宅。一九五四年国家用于房屋建筑的拨款达二百五十五亿卢布。莫斯科市今年将获得建筑面积为九十万平方公尺的新住宅。莫斯科州的城市和工人住宅区今年共建造建筑面积为七十八万平方公尺的住宅。
    苏联的保健事业日益发展。最近三年来，仅苏联卫生部系统的医生就增加了三万人，受过中等教育的医务工作人员增加了七万人。现在苏联总计有将近三十万医生和将近九十万受过中等教育的医务工作人员。在各风景优美的地方共有二千多个疗养院，三百五十多个避暑地区以及无数的休养所。今年在这些地区休养的劳动人民在五百多万人以上。
