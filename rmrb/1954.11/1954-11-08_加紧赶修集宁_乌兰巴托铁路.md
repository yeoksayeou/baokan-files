    Speed Up the Construction of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway
    Jia Huaiji, Acting Director of the Third Engineering Bureau, Newly Built Railway Engineering General Bureau, Ministry of Railways
    The construction of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway is proceeding intensely. In the construction project within our country, Soviet experts have provided us with a great deal of assistance with great concern, from design to construction, and have given us great inspiration in mastering project quality and cost, and establishing the idea of economic accounting. In particular, with the help and guidance of experts, we have comprehensively launched winter construction, greatly reduced the cost of manpower and materials, and bought time, which will enable this railway to be opened to traffic and joint transportation as soon as possible.
    The section of this railway within our country is mostly built on grasslands. The population along the line is sparse, water sources are scarce, the climate is cold, the wind and sand are heavy, and transportation is inconvenient, which has caused many difficulties for the construction of the railway. For example, the various materials required for railway construction and the daily necessities of the workers are rarely available along the line, and most of them have to be transported from afar. Due to the cold climate, according to the old habits, construction cannot be carried out for nearly half a year, so how to carry out winter construction and strive to work twelve months a year is of particular importance to the construction of this road.
    Winter construction is a completely new topic for the employees of the Third Engineering Bureau. Not long after the project started, after the Soviet experts inspected the construction situation, they suggested that one of the important keys to building the Jining-Erlian railway lies in how to organize winter construction. Last September, when winter was approaching, expert Kaplanov gave a detailed report to our bureau's employees on the issue of winter construction. He pointed out that the geological conditions along the Jining-Erlian railway are good, most of the soil is permeable, the quality of winter construction can be guaranteed, and it is entirely possible and necessary to carry out winter construction. He said that the Soviet Union had widely adopted the method of winter construction during the first five-year plan, and the implementation of winter construction at that time relied on the achievements of advanced workers and scientific working methods. While introducing the Soviet Union's experience in winter construction, the experts also put forward extremely specific and comprehensive opinions on the preparation and various technical measures for winter construction based on the progress of the Jining-Erlian project at that time. The expert's report gave us great inspiration, making us realize that only by correctly organizing winter construction can we effectively shorten the construction period and enable the Jining-Erlian railway to be handed over to the state for use as soon as possible. This is of great significance for organizing balanced construction throughout the year, balancing labor, reducing idle work and waste, and saving state property. However, at that time, many employees lacked experience in winter construction, lacked confidence, and had many concerns in their minds, believing that the technical conditions were not sufficient, fearing that the quality could not be guaranteed, and fearing that the cost was too high, etc. In view of this situation, we organized employees to carefully study the reports of Soviet experts, so that everyone could realize the great significance of winter construction in accelerating the country's socialist construction. At the same time, we made specific preparations in engineering technology and employees' cold protection equipment, and focused on organizing employees to try out the operating methods of winter construction, improving operating skills, and creating conditions for winter construction.
    During the winter construction last winter and this spring, the experts constantly gave us guidance and assistance, and with the active efforts of all employees, certain achievements were obtained. For example, in earthwork engineering, the frozen soil blasting method was carried out, and after continuous improvement, an average of 40 cubic meters of frozen soil could be blasted with one shot, and the highest reached 100 cubic meters. In terms of bridge culverts and finished product manufacturing, the "warm bottle method" and the "warm shed method" were promoted, and the "rapid freezing method" was used in house construction. We implemented the experts' suggestions and basically launched a comprehensive winter construction. The severe cold and snow on the grassland did not force us to stop working. Last winter and this spring, a huge amount of work was completed in various projects such as roadbed earthwork and stonework, bridge culverts, houses, ballast laying, and steel rails. Except for some individual projects with shortcomings, most of them met the requirements for use. At the same time, from leading cadres to workers, they learned some experience in winter construction.
    This August, expert Ovkalov Comrade reminded us again that the problem of winter construction is once again in front of us. He pointed out that to do a good job in winter construction, it is necessary to make full preparations in advance. Whether the task of winter construction can be successfully completed also depends on whether the construction project can be correctly selected and the construction method and construction organization can be determined. Under the guidance of expert Ovkalov, we have made relatively full preparations for this year's winter construction. This year's winter construction task is even greater, with 300,000 cubic meters of roadbed earthwork and stonework, 23,000 square meters of houses, 80,000 cubic meters of ballast laying, and 182 kilometers of track laying (including tracks in the station), as well as bridges, culverts, etc., which is seven times larger than the winter project last year.
    In order to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and complete the arduous task of winter construction, the Third Engineering Bureau recently held a political work conference and an engineering conference to carry out ideological mobilization, make a construction plan; and compile winter construction textbooks and winter construction operation methods, and organize cadres and employees to study. Now, various cold-proof and antifreeze materials such as warm sheds, sawdust, stoves, and leather clothes have been mostly prepared, and various departments will enter winter construction one after another. The Engineering Bureau also organized five work groups to assist in the work on site.
    In celebrating the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we deeply appreciate the great help of the Soviet people to us. All employees of our bureau will overcome the difficulties of the severe winter, work hard with high enthusiasm, and seize every minute and second so that the railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar can be opened to traffic as soon as possible, so as to link our country and the great Soviet Union more closely.

    加紧赶修集宁—乌兰巴托铁路
    铁道部新建铁路工程总局第三工程局代理局长  贾怀济
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路修筑工程正在紧张进行。在我国境内的修建工程中，苏联专家以十分关切的心情，从设计到施工给了我们很多帮助，在掌握工程质量和成本，树立经济核算思想方面，给了我们很大的启示。特别是在专家的帮助和指导下，我们全面地展开了冬季施工，大大减少了人力、物力的费用，争取了时间，将使这条铁路能够早日通车联运。
    这条铁路在我国境内的一段，大部分修建在草原上。沿线人烟稀少，水源缺乏，气候寒冷，风沙大，交通运输不便，给铁路的修建造成不少困难。如修筑铁路所需用的各项材料和职工的生活用品，沿线可供利用的很少，大部分都要从远方运来。由于气候寒冷，照旧的习惯，一年中有将近半年不能施工，所以如何进行冬季施工，争取一年工作十二个月，对这条路的修建就有特别重要的意义。
    冬季施工对第三工程局的职工来说，完全是一个新的课题。工程开始不久，当苏联专家考察了施工的情况后，就建议说，修建集二路的重要关键之一，是在于如何组织冬季施工。去年九月，冬季快要来临的时候，专家卡普兰诺夫就冬季施工问题给我局职工作了详尽的报告。他指出，集二路沿线地质条件良好，大部是渗水土壤，冬季施工质量可以保证，进行冬季施工是完全可能和必要的。他说，苏联在第一个五年计划时期，已广泛采用了冬季施工的方法，冬季施工的实施在当时是依靠先进工作者的成就和科学的工作方法来推行的。专家一方面介绍苏联冬季施工的经验，同时又根据集二路当时工程进行的情况，就冬季施工的准备和各项技术措施提出了极为具体周全的意见。专家的报告给我们很大启示，使我们认识到，只有正确地组织冬季施工，才能有效地缩短工期，使集二路能早日交给国家使用。这对常年组织均衡施工，平衡劳动力，减少窝工浪费，节省国家财产都有重大意义。但当时许多职工对冬季施工缺乏经验，信心不足，思想上有很多顾虑，认为技术条件不够，怕不能保证质量，怕成本太高等等。根据这种情况，我们就组织职工认真学习苏联专家的报告，使大家认识到冬季施工对加速国家社会主义建设的重大意义，同时在工程技术及职工防寒设备上都作了具体准备，并有重点地组织职工试行冬季施工的操作方法，提高了操作技术，为进行冬季施工创造了条件。
    在去冬今春冬季施工过程中，专家不断给予我们指导和帮助，经全体职工的积极努力，获得了一定的成绩。如在土方工程上进行冻土爆破法，经过不断改进，一炮平均能炸到冻土四十立方，最高达到一百立方。在桥涵及成品制造方面，推行了“暖瓶法”和“暖棚法”，在房屋建筑上使用了“迅速冻结法”。我们执行了专家的建议，基本上展开了全面的冬季施工。草原上的严寒和风雪都没有迫使我们停止工作。去冬和今春，在路基土石方、桥涵、房屋、铺碴、钢轨等各项工程上，完成了规模巨大的工程。除个别工程存在着缺点外，一般均达到了使用要求。同时，从领导干部到工人都学到了一些冬季施工的经验。
    今年八月，专家奥甫卡洛夫同志又提醒我们说，冬季施工问题又摆在面前了。他指出，要作好冬季施工，必需事前充分做好准备工作，冬季施工的任务能否顺利完成，还决定于是否能正确地选定工程项目，定出施工方法和施工组织。在奥甫卡洛夫专家的指导下，我们对今年的冬季施工作了比较充分的准备。今年冬季施工的任务更大了，计有路基土石方三十万方，房屋两万三千平方公尺，铺道碴八万方，铺轨一百八十二公里（包括站内轨道）还有桥梁、涵管等，比去年冬季的工程大七倍。
    为贯彻执行苏联专家的建议，完成冬季施工的艰巨任务，第三工程局最近召开了政治工作会议和工程会议，进行思想动员，作好施工计划；并编制了冬季施工教材、冬季施工操作方法，组织干部和职工进行学习。现在，暖棚、锯末、火炉、皮衣等各种防寒、防冻材料已大部齐备，各部分将先后进入冬季施工。工程局并组织了五个工作组到现场协助工作。
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年的时候，我们深深感激苏联人民对我们伟大的帮助，我局全体职工将战胜严冬的困难，以高度的热情紧张工作，争取一分一秒的时间，使这条从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路能早日通车，以便把我国和伟大的苏联更加紧密地联系起来。
