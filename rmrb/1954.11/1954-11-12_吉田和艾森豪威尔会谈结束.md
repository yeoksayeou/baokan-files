Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 11th: The talks between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and the heads of the US government, which began in Washington on the 8th, concluded on the 10th. The joint statement issued by Yoshida and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the day the talks ended, although filled with words like "peace" and "freedom," failed to conceal the reality that the United States continues to use Japan as a tool for its aggressive policies in the Far East under these guises.

The joint statement by Yoshida and Eisenhower announced that their governments "will continue to make joint efforts in cooperation with free countries in Asia"; Yoshida also reiterated his government's determination to make "full contributions" to these efforts. Although the joint statement avoided mentioning the specific content of the "efforts" the United States requires of Japan, Yoshida revealed in a speech in New York on the 5th that Japan will continue to assume its "responsibilities in anti-communist defense."

Departing from such a purpose, the representatives of the US and Japanese "governments discussed in detail Japan's economic situation." The joint statement stipulates that Japan must continue to implement the fiscal and financial "austerity" policies that have brought it to the brink of ruin. The communique also stated that the US and Japan have agreed that the US will sell agricultural products to Japan, and one of the uses of the income from the sales will be to support Japan's "defense." According to foreign news agencies, the United States will allow Japan to purchase approximately $100 million worth of surplus US agricultural products in yen. The Associated Press reported that the prices of US surplus grains and cotton are set 20 percent higher than world market prices. Furthermore, the United States will retain a portion of the payments for its military expenditures in Japan.

Another "way out" for the United States to guide the Japanese economy is to have Japan serve the economic plans in the US aggression in Southeast Asia. The communique stated that the talks also discussed "Japan's participation with other free countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia in the economic development of that region." Regarding this issue, Yoshida and US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had previously publicly advocated the necessity of a Southeast Asia "development plan." Dulles also revealed that the United States advocates including countries outside the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in this plan.

Nevertheless, Yoshida failed to obtain the clear "assistance" from the United States that he had hoped for. According to a Reuters report from Washington, US and Japanese officials admitted on the 10th that the US-Japan talks "did not achieve the objective of reaching concrete agreements on measures to alleviate Japan's pressing economic and financial difficulties." The two delegations will continue to hold negotiations in Tokyo and Washington to resolve the following "important issues": the exact amount of surplus agricultural products the United States will sell to Japan and the allocation and use of the payments; increasing the declining US military expenditures in Japan; reducing the disguised occupation fees that Japan pays to the US military next year to be transferred to Japan's expansion of armaments.

### 吉田和艾森豪威尔会谈结束

    吉田和艾森豪威尔会谈结束
    【新华社十一日讯】华盛顿消息：从八日在华盛顿开始举行的日本首相吉田茂和美国政府首脑的会谈，已在十日结束。吉田茂和美国总统艾森豪威尔在会谈结束的当天所发表的联合声明，虽然填满了“和平”和“自由”的字眼，但是并未能掩盖美国在这些外衣之下要继续使日本充当它在远东的侵略政策的工具的实质。
    吉田和艾森豪威尔的联合声明宣布，他们的政府“将在亚洲自由国家的合作下继续进行联合的努力”；吉田并重申了他的政府愿对这些努力提供
  “充分贡献”的决心。尽管联合声明避而不谈美国要求日本“努力”的具体内容，但是，吉田五日在纽约发表谈话时已经透露，日本将继续担负起它在
  “反共防务方面的责任”。
    从这样一个目的出发，美日“两国政府代表详细地讨论了日本的经济情况”。联合声明规定日本必须继续实行已使它山穷水尽的财政金融“紧缩”政策。公报又说，美日两国已商定，美国将以农产品卖给日本，而售卖所得的收入的用途之一将是支持日本的“防御”。据外国通讯社透露，美国将允许日本以日元付款购买价值约一亿美元的美国剩余农产品。美联社说，美国剩余谷物和棉花的价格订得比世界市场价格高百分之二十。并且，美国将保留一部分货款作美国在日本的军事开支。
    美国引导日本经济的另一条“出路”，是要日本为美国侵略东南亚计划中的经济计划服务。公报说，在会谈中还讨论了“日本同南亚和东南亚的其他自由国家一同参加那个地区的经济发展”的问题。关于这个问题，吉田和美国国务卿杜勒斯在这以前都已公开宣传有一个东南亚“开发计划”的必要。杜勒斯并透露，美国主张必须把东南亚条约签字国以外的国家包括在这个计划之内。
    虽然如此，吉田并未能从美国获得如他所期望那样明确的“援助”。据路透社华盛顿消息，美国和日本的官员们十日承认，美日会谈“并未达到这样的目的：就减轻日本迫切的经济和财政困难的一些措施获致具体的协议”。两国代表团将继续在东京和华盛顿举行谈判，以便解决下列一些“重要问题”：美国卖给日本剩余农产品的确切数目和价款的分配与使用；增加正在下降中的美国在日本的军事开支；减少明年度日本付给美军的变相占领费，以移作日本扩充军备之用。
