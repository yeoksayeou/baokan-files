Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Osaka dispatch: On the afternoon of the 9th, a grand rally attended by nearly 40,000 people was held in Osaka to welcome the visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society. Participants included representatives from all walks of life and organizations from Osaka, Kobe, and regions such as Kyushu, Shikoku, and Chugoku.
　　The venue was set up in Osaka's Ogimachi Park. The surrounding area was plastered with slogans such as "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship," "Peace and friendship," "Peaceful coexistence," and "For peace in Asia." Opposite the stage flew the Chinese flag, the Japanese flag, and the Red Cross flag.
　　Participants in the meeting included荒男 Imamura, President of Osaka University and Chairman of the Welcome Committee;菅原昌人 Masato Sugawara, Director of the Osaka Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association; 本庄实 Minoru Honjo, Chairman of the Osaka Peace Liaison Conference; 横手真夫 Masao Yokote, Vice Chairman of the Osaka Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan; 比嘉正子 Masako Higa, President of the Kansai Housewives Federation; 武田义三 Yoshizo Takeda, Mayor of Ikeda City; 八木重太郎 Jotaro Yagi, Chairman of the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly, as well as leaders of local organizations of various political parties.
　　After the meeting began with the national anthem of the People's Republic of China, Imamura荒男 delivered a welcoming speech. He said: The kindness of the Chinese people regarding the return of Japanese expatriates in China and the lenient treatment of war criminals, disaster relief for wind and flood disasters, and Sino-Japanese trade is deeply engraved in our hearts and will never be forgotten. Although China and Japan have not yet restored normal diplomatic relations, China and Japan are direct neighbors and should maintain a mutually supportive relationship. After the war, the Japanese people found themselves in extremely complex and difficult internal and external environments, and most people have a close feeling towards China. We believe that even if the Chinese and Japanese people have differences in political ideologies, they can shake hands and coexist peacefully. There is no doubt about this. In this sense, we hope that this visit will be the beginning of friendly cooperation between China and Japan. His speech was greeted with warm applause.
　　After Imamura荒男's speech, the delegation was presented with flowers.
　　Delegation leader Li Dequan delivered a speech. She said: In order to guarantee and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, Japan and China have a very important responsibility. We believe that developing friendly and cooperative relations between China and Japan is the common wish of the people of both countries. We believe that Sino-Japanese trade has a bright future. We Chinese people are willing to conduct close cultural ties with Japan, and we believe that through cultural exchanges, we will be able to understand each other better. She pointed out: Of course, the road to realizing Sino-Japanese friendship is not without difficulties. There is an external force that hopes that China and Japan will be at odds and hostile to each other in order to profit from it. However, based on our personal experience during this visit to your country, and based on the friendship expressed by Japanese friends to us, we deeply realize that the people of China and Japan will definitely be able to become friendly through their own efforts, and they will definitely be able to overcome this external resistance.
　　Li Dequan's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause from the audience.
　　The conference then featured wonderful song and dance performances prepared by Japanese and Korean friends for the visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Osaka dispatch: On the afternoon of the 9th, Li Dequan, head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, and others attended a symposium of women from all walks of life in Osaka. About 700 representatives from about 50 organizations, including the Kansai Housewives Federation and the Women's Department of the Osaka Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, attended the symposium. At the meeting, Li Dequan answered various questions raised by representatives of various groups regarding the status of Chinese women in political, economic, and cultural life, social activities, and family life. Those present expressed satisfaction with Li Dequan's answers.
　　At the same time, Deputy Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi and others were also invited to attend a symposium with more than 600 representatives from all walks of life and organizations from two prefectures and twenty counties in western Japan. At the meeting, everyone expressed their desire to promote cultural exchange and peaceful friendship between Japan and China. Prior to this, at 9:00 a.m., the delegation also visited the municipal "Yamada Kosaikai" orphanage and nursing home in the suburbs of Osaka, and attended a general meeting of families of Japanese expatriates.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Osaka dispatch: People from the economic circles of the Kansai region hosted a banquet for the visiting delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society at 5:00 p.m. on the 9th.

　　At the meeting, Masao Tajima delivered a welcoming speech, saying: The development of China since its founding is truly astonishing. It can be said that this is entirely the result of the strong will and unyielding efforts of the Chinese people. We express our heartfelt respect for this and wish your country a bright future. At the same time, we believe that as your country's construction progresses, China and Japan can increase economic exchanges with each other. He said: We have very keen hopes for the development of economic exchanges between China and Japan. Recently, among countries all over the world, regardless of political organizations and social systems, the voices of those who believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and demand the promotion of East-West trade are growing stronger. Under these circumstances, Japan also believes that it is necessary to promote trade relations between China and Japan in any case, and this has become the public opinion of the vast majority of economic figures.
　　After delegation leader Li Dequan delivered a reply, deputy delegation leader Liao Chengzhi delivered a speech, saying: We are confident that promoting the gradual progress of Sino-Japanese trade will enable the two countries to carry out economic and trade exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and mutual exchange of needed goods. Sino-Japanese relations are currently in an abnormal state, but our trade and economic exchanges can take various forms, that is, non-governmental forms. He said: We hope that our country's economic and trade delegation can visit Japan, and we also welcome a Japanese economic and trade delegation to visit our country. He finally called for efforts to promote Sino-Japanese economic exchange.

    日本关西地区经济界人士设宴招待中国红十字会代表团
   【新华社十日讯】大阪消息：九日下午六时半，在大阪市举行了近四万人参加的盛大集会，欢迎中国红十字会访日代表团。参加大会的有大阪、神户和来自九州、四国、中国等地区的各阶层各团体的代表。
    会场设在大阪市扇町公园。会场四周贴着“中日友好万岁”、“和平、亲善”、“和平共处”、
  “为了亚洲的和平”等标语。主席台的对面飘扬着中国国旗、日本国旗和红十字旗。
    参加大会的有欢迎委员会会长、大阪大学校长今村荒男，日中友好协会大阪分会理事长菅原昌人，大阪和平联络会议委员长本庄实，日本工会总评议会大阪地方评议会副主席横手真夫，关西主妇联合会会长比嘉正子，池田市市长武田义三，京都府议会议长八木重太郎以及各政党地方组织的负责人。
    大会在中华人民共和国国歌声中开始后，今村荒男致欢迎词。他说：关于在华日侨回国和对战犯的宽大处理，风灾、水灾的赈济以及中日贸易的问题等等，中国给我们日本人民的好意，使我们铭记在心，永远难忘。现在虽然中国和日本还没有恢复正常的国交，可是由于中日两国是直接的近邻，应该保持唇齿相关的互相扶助的关系。战后，日本人民处在极其复杂而困难的内外环境之中，大多数的人们都是对中国抱着亲密的感情的。我们相信中日两国人民即使有政治主义上的不同，也可以互相握手共存共处，这是无可置疑的。在这种意义上，我们希望诸位这次的访问能够成为中日两国友好合作的开端。他的讲话博得热烈的鼓掌。
    今村荒男讲话后，大会向代表团献花。
    李德全团长致词。她说：为了保证和巩固亚洲和世界的和平，日本和中国的责任十分重大。我们相信，发展中日两国的友好合作关系是中日两国人民的共同愿望。我们相信，中日贸易是有光明的前途的。我们中国人民愿意同日本进行密切的文化联系，我们相信通过文化交流，将使我们之间更能相互了解。她指出：当然，实现中日友好的道路并不是没有困难的。有一种外来的阻力，他们希望中日之间不和，并且相互敌视，以便他们从中取利。但是根据我们此次访问贵国的切身体验，根据日本朋友对我们表示的友情，使我们深深体会到，中日两国人民经过自己的努力，是一定能够友好起来的，是一定能够克服这个外来的阻力的。
    李德全团长的讲话一再被全场的掌声打断。
    大会接着演出了日本朋友和朝鲜朋友为中国红十字会访日代表团准备的精采歌舞节目。
   【新华社十日讯】大阪消息：中国红十字会访日代表团团长李德全等九日下午三时，应邀出席了大阪市的各界妇女座谈会。参加座谈会的有关西主妇联合会、日本工会总评议会大阪地方评议会妇女部等约五十个团体的代表共约七百人。会上，李德全团长答复了各团体代表提出关于中国妇女在政治、经济、文化生活中的地位，社会活动和家庭生活等种种问题。到会者对李德全的答问，表示满意。
    同时，廖承志副团长等也应邀出席了西部日本两府二十县各界、各团体代表六百多人的座谈会。会上大家表示了促进日中文化交流与和平友好的愿望。在这以前，上午九时，代表团还曾到大阪郊区参观了市立“山田弘济院”的孤儿院和养老院等，并出席了在外日人家属大会。
   【新华社十日讯】大阪消息：关西地区经济界的人士在九日下午五时设宴招待中国红十字会访日代表团。

    李德全团长致答词后，廖承志副团长致词说：我们确信促进中日贸易的逐步进行，会使两国在平等互利、互通有无的基础上展开经济、贸易交流。中日两国的关系目前还处在不正常的状态中，但是，我们的贸易经济交流可以有各种形式，也就是民间形式。他说：我们希望我国的经济贸易代表团可以访问日本，我们也欢迎日本经济贸易代表团访问我国。他最后要求为促进中日经济交流而努力。
