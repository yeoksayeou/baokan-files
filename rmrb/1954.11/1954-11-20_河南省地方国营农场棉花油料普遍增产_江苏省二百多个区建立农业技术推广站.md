　　Henan Province's Local State-Run Farms Report Universal Increases in Cotton and Oilseed Production
　　Over Two Hundred Districts in Jiangsu Province Establish Agricultural Technology Extension Stations

　　Henan Province's one hundred and thirty-odd local state-run farms overfulfilled their cotton production plan by 32 percent and their oilseed production plan by 13 percent. The cotton from the Anyang Special District farms averaged 223 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding the planned yield by 7 jin. The best cotton from the Shanxian Farm averaged 368 jin of seed cotton per mu, with the entire farm averaging an increase of more than 30 jin of seed cotton per mu. The sesame production from the Linru County Farm increased by 30 percent. The 250 mu of peanuts from the Kaifeng County Farm exceeded the planned yield by 17.6 percent, increased by 50 percent compared to last year, and yielded 20 percent more than the local agricultural producers' cooperatives.

　　In the activities to strive for increased cotton and oilseed production, all farms provided technical guidance and assistance to nearby farmers. The cotton from the Shibei Township Jianyi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xinxiang County increased by more than 20 percent compared to last year. Their 20 mu of high-yield cotton grew almost as well as the cotton from the Xinxiang County Farm. The cooperative members expressed their gratitude for the help from the state-run farm.

　　Jiangsu Province has successively established agricultural technology extension stations in two hundred and forty-four districts. These agricultural technology extension stations all have various professional and technical cadres, and the station directors are concurrently held by the district heads or members of the District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party. Their tasks are to summarize the local farmers' experience in increasing production, promote agricultural science and technology, teach the use of new-style farm tools, cultivate agricultural technical backbones from among the farmers, and guide the accounting work of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

　　The district agricultural technology extension stations in ten counties, including Wuxi, Baoshan, Qingpu, Jianhu, and Sheyang, all held technical training classes during the establishment process. More than 1,500 people participated in the study, including technicians or seed keepers from agricultural producers' cooperatives. The technical personnel of the agricultural technology extension stations taught them techniques such as wheat cultivation, seed selection, seed soaking, and pest and disease control.

    河南省地方国营农场棉花油料普遍增产
    江苏省二百多个区建立农业技术推广站
    河南省一百三十多个地方国营农场的棉花超额百分之三十二、油料超额百分之十三完成了生产计划。安阳专区农场的棉花，平均每亩可产籽棉二百二十三斤，超过计划产量七斤。陕县农场最好的棉花平均每亩可收籽棉三百六十八斤，全场平均每亩可增产籽棉三十多斤。临汝县农场的芝麻增产了三成。开封县农场的二百五十亩花生，超过计划产量百分之十七点六，比去年增产五成，比当地农业生产合作社的收成多百分之二十。
    各农场在争取棉花、油料增产的活动中，都对附近农民进行了技术指导和帮助。新乡县石碑乡建一农业生产合作社的棉花比去年增产二成多，他们的二十亩丰产棉花几乎和新乡县农场的棉花长得一样好，社员对国营农场的帮助表示十分感谢。

    江苏省已有二百四十四个区相继建立了农业技术推广站。这些农业技术推广站都有各种专业技术干部，站长由区长或中共区委会委员兼任。它们的任务是总结当地农民的增产经验，推广农业科学技术，传授新式农具的使用方法，从农民中培养农业技术骨干分子，并指导农业生产合作社的会计工作。
    无锡、宝山、青浦、建湖、射阳等十个县的区农业技术推广站，在建站过程中都举办了技术训练班。参加学习的有一千五百多人，他们是农业生产合作社的技术员或种子保管员。农业技术推广站的技术人员向他们传授小麦栽培、选种、浸种、防治病虫害等技术。　（据新华社讯）
