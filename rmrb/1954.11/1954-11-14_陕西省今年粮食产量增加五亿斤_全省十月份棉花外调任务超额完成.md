    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th: Shaanxi Province has exceeded its grain production plan for this year. It is estimated that the province's total grain output will exceed the plan by more than 9 percent, an increase of 500 million jin compared to last year.
    On the fertile banks of the Wei River, nearly forty counties (cities) have seen farmers actively invest in agricultural production and adopt advanced farming techniques such as improved varieties, rational close planting, and phased fertilization, thus smoothly completing this year's grain increase plan. In the Han River basin of the Ankang Special District, nearly 400,000 mu of paddy fields have seen an average yield increase of about 34 percent compared to last year, thanks to farmers' efforts to strengthen field management. In Bao City County, Hanzhong Special District, more than ten high-yield households have emerged, with an average yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu of their paddy fields. In the grain-deficient and low-yield areas of southern and northern Shaanxi Province, grain production has also been increased this year by adapting to local conditions. In the Shangluo and Suide Special Districts, the yield of potato crops exceeded the plan by nearly 50 percent due to the expansion of planting area. Farmers in sixty-six counties such as Mizhi and Huanglong have promoted rational close planting, generally increasing corn and millet production by more than 10 percent.
    This year, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Shaanxi Province have vividly demonstrated their superiority in grain production increase. Thirty-one agricultural production cooperatives and one collective farm in nine counties, including Longxian and Mei County, achieved an average wheat yield of 348 jin per mu, 124 jin higher than that of ordinary farmers in these nine counties. Ten agricultural production cooperatives in three counties, including Yichuan and Wuqi, achieved 20 to 50 percent higher unit area yields of sorghum, millet, and glutinous millet than local ordinary farmers.
    [This Newspaper] Shaanxi Province completed 101 percent of its October cotton outward transfer task, strongly supporting the production of textile industries in Shanghai and other places.
    In order to transport the new cotton to cotton textile factories in a timely manner, various parts of Shaanxi concentrated many vehicles and ships to transport cotton quickly. Local textile companies and railway departments strengthened their communication, ensuring that cotton was transported as soon as it arrived. Employees of the Fuping County Company of China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation actively sought ways to increase the loading capacity of cotton. In the past, each railway car could only load 17 tons of cotton, but now it can load 19 tons, thus speeding up transportation and saving costs. In October, in addition to more than 13 million jin of new cotton transported to state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in Guanzhong, a total of more than 14 million jin of textile cotton was transported to Shanghai, Sichuan, Hubei, and other places. Most of the cotton transported to various places was sub-superior and medium-grade cotton.

    陕西省今年粮食产量增加五亿斤
    全省十月份棉花外调任务超额完成
    【新华社西安十二日电】陕西省超额完成今年粮食生产计划。据估计：今年全省粮食总产量超过计划百分之九强，比去年增加五亿斤。
    在富饶的渭河两岸，近四十个县（市）的农民积极投资农业生产，并采用优良品种、合理密植、分期施肥等先进耕作技术，因而顺利地完成了今年的粮食增产计划。汉水流域安康专区的近四十万亩稻田，由于农民努力加强田间管理，每亩平均产量比去年提高了百分之三十四左右。汉中专区褒城县还出现了十多个丰产户，他们的稻田平均每亩产一千斤以上。在陕西省南部和北部的缺粮区和粮食低产地区，今年也因地制宜地提高了粮食产量。商雒、绥德等专区的薯类作物，由于扩大了播种面积，产量超过计划近百分之五十。米脂、黄龙等六十六县农民推行合理密植，使玉米、谷子一般都增产百分之十以上。
    今年陕西省农业生产互助合作组织在粮食增产中鲜明地显示了优越性。陇县、郿县等九县的三十一个农业生产合作社和一个集体农庄，小麦产量平均每亩达三百四十八斤，比这九县的一般农户高出一百二十四斤。宜川、吴旗等三县的十个农业生产合作社，高粱、谷子、糜子的单位面积产量比当地一般农户高出百分之二十到百分之五十。
    【本报讯】陕西省十月份棉花外调任务完成了百分之一百零一，有力地支持了上海等地纺织工业的生产。
    陕西各地为了及时把新棉花运到棉纺织厂，集中了许多车辆、船只，迅速运输棉花。各地花纱布公司和铁路部门加强了联系，作到了随到随运。中国花纱布公司富平县公司的职工们积极设法提高棉花装载量，过去一车皮只能装十七吨棉花，现在能装十九吨，因而加快了运输速度，并节省了费用。十月份，全省除运到关中各国营、公私合营棉纺织厂一千三百多万斤新棉外，运往上海、四川、湖北等地的纺织用棉，共有一千四百多万斤。运往各地的棉花，大部分是次上级和中级棉花。
