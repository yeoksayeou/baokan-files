Liaoxi Province's state-owned aquatic products companies and coastal fishermen have achieved a bumper harvest in spring fishing. According to preliminary calculations from five aquatic products companies, the average yield per net is 15 jin, with the highest reaching 50 jin, an increase of nearly tenfold compared to the same period last year (last spring saw a reduction in production due to unfavorable natural conditions). The captured aquatic products are being processed and supplied to meet the needs of urban residents, and are currently being marketed in large quantities.

In order to support the development of fishery production, the Provincial People's Government has issued more than 2 billion yuan in fishery loans, and supply and marketing cooperatives have supplied a large number of cotton yarn and timber for weaving nets and repairing boats, enabling the fishermen to complete various preparations for going to sea in a timely manner. At the same time, through the promotion of the general line, the enthusiasm of fishermen for mutual aid and cooperation has been greatly enhanced. Currently, more than 90 fishery production cooperatives and 145 fishery mutual aid groups have been organized throughout the province.

    辽西省春季鱼产丰收
    辽西省各国营水产公司和沿海渔民，春季下海捕鱼获得丰收。根据五个水产公司的初步计算，平均每张网可生产十五斤，最高的达到五十斤，比去年同一时期增产将近十倍（去年春季因自然条件不好而减产）。捕获的水产品，一部分进行加工，一部分供应城市人民的需要，目前，已大量上市。
    为了扶植渔业生产的发展，该省人民政府发放了二十多亿元渔业贷款，供销合作社供应了大批织网和修船用的棉纱、木料等，使渔民群众及时完成了下海的各项准备工作。同时经过总路线的宣传，大大提高了渔民互助合作的积极性。现在全省已组织起九十多个渔业生产合作社，一百四十五个渔业互助组。
