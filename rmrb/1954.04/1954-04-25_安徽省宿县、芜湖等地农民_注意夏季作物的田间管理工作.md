Farmers in various places in Suxian, Wuhu, Chuxian and other special districts of Anhui Province have strengthened the field management of summer crops during the spring plowing and sowing in order to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops. Farmers in Wangnian Township, Suixi County, Suxian Special District, immediately carried out weeding and topdressing in wheat fields after planting potatoes and sorghum. More than 80% of the township's more than 11,000 mu of wheat have been weeded, and more than 5,000 mu of fields have been topdressed with fertilizer. Gangsi Township, Suxian County, organized hundreds of laborers and semi-laborers to weed wheat fields during spring sowing. During the weeding process, they also organized forces to inspect each weeded field and promptly re-weed if any rough patches were found. Thanks to the importance attached by the leadership and the rational use of labor, the township completed the spring sowing task and weeded more than 5,300 mu of wheat fields. The field management of summer crops in Wuhu Special District this year has also been done well. Summer crops throughout the district have been weeded twice and fertilized twice, and some areas have even reached three to four times. More than 20,000 mu of summer crops in Shenxiang District, Xuancheng County, have been ditched and drained to prevent floods. Recently, red spiders have been found to be harming wheat seedlings in Chuxian, Wuhu and other places. The leading organs in various places attach great importance to this situation and actively organize the masses to catch and kill them. The Wuhu Special District has allocated some powder sprayers and "666" powder to areas where pests have occurred. Buji District in He County has mobilized the masses to eliminate pests.

    安徽省宿县、芜湖等地农民
    注意夏季作物的田间管理工作
    为了保证夏季作物的丰收，安徽省宿县、芜湖、滁县等专区不少地方，在春耕播种工作中，加强了夏季作物的田间管理工作。宿县专区濉溪县王埝乡农民在刚种完马铃薯和高粱后，立即在麦田进行锄草、追肥，全乡一万一千多亩小麦，已有百分之八十锄了草，并有五千多亩田追上了肥料。宿县岗寺乡在春播的时候，另外组织几百个劳动力和半劳动力到麦田锄草；在锄草过程中，又组织力量，对锄过的每块田进行检查，发现粗糙现象，及时补锄。由于领导重视，合理使用劳动力，全乡在完成春播任务的同时，又锄完了五千三百多亩麦田。芜湖专区各地今年夏季作物田间管理工作做得也比较好，全区夏季作物都锄了两次草和追了两次肥，部分地区还达到三次至四次，宣城县沈巷区二万多亩夏季作物，都进行了铲沟沥水，防止涝灾。最近，滁县、芜湖等地先后发现红蜘蛛危害麦苗。各地领导机关对这一情况都很重视，积极组织群众捕打。芜湖专区调拨一部分喷粉器和“六六六”药粉到发生虫害的地区，和县卜集区发动群众扑灭害虫。
