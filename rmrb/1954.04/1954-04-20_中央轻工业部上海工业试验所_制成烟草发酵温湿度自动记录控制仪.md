    Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Ministry of Light Industry
    Manufactures Automatic Recording and Control Instrument for Temperature and Humidity in Tobacco Fermentation

    China's first automatic recording and control instrument for temperature and humidity in tobacco fermentation has been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Ministry of Light Industry.

    Tobacco fermentation is an important process in tobacco processing. In the past, tobacco leaves were often allowed to ferment naturally, which required one to two years and large warehouses. If the advanced Soviet method of artificial tobacco fermentation is adopted, the tobacco leaves can be made to ferment faster under the influence of a certain temperature and humidity, and the entire fermentation process will take less than two weeks. However, this requires automatic control equipment; relying solely on manual adjustment will not yield good results.

    In order to solve this problem, the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central Ministry of Light Industry launched research and trial production work in February of last year. After continuous improvement, the first automatic recording and control instrument for temperature and humidity in tobacco fermentation has been successfully trial-produced.

    The entire set of trial-produced automatic temperature and humidity recording and control instruments can use all domestically produced materials except for two vacuum tubes (made in the Soviet Union). Preliminary trials by the state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 5 have shown good results.

    The successful trial production of the automatic temperature and humidity recording and control instrument is also of great significance to other industrial sectors. This is because, after slight changes in design, this instrument can also be widely used in industries such as food, textile, papermaking, rubber, and printing.

    中央轻工业部上海工业试验所
    制成烟草发酵温湿度自动记录控制仪
    我国第一架烟草发酵温度湿度自动记录控制仪，已在中央人民政府轻工业部上海工业试验所试制成功。
    烟草发酵是烟草加工中一个重要的过程。过去常让烟叶自然发酵，因此需要一两年的时间和大的仓库。如采用苏联的先进方法，进行烟草人工发酵，使烟叶在一定的温度和湿度的影响下，加速发酵作用，整个发酵过程要不了两个星期。可是这要有自动控制设备，如单凭人工调节，不能得到良好的结果。
      中央轻工业部上海工业试验所为了解决这个问题，于去年二月间就展开了研究试制工作，经过不断的改进，第一架烟草发酵温度湿度自动记录控制仪已试制成功。
    试制成的全套温度湿度自动记录控制仪，除真空管二只（苏联出品）外，全部都可采用国产材料。经国营上海卷烟五厂初步试用，效果良好。
    温度湿度自动记录控制仪器的试制成功，对其他工业部门也有重大意义。因为这种仪器略经改变设计后，还可广泛地应用于食品、纺织、造纸、橡胶、印刷等工业。
