    Sichuan Province, Ba County, Jielong Township
    Farmers Help with Preliminary Iron Ore Prospecting
    Last winter, after studying the general line of the state during the transition period, the farmers of Jielong Township, Ba County, Sichuan Province, wrote five letters to the Southwest Geological Bureau of the Central Ministry of Geology reporting ore deposits, and enclosed iron ore maps of an area of 20 square kilometers. This spring, when the Southwest Geological Bureau sent twelve geological team members to conduct preliminary prospecting, the nearby farmers enthusiastically helped to solve difficulties such as housing and food. When cleaning old mine tunnels, some timber was needed, and the township people's government mobilized the farmers to supply it in a timely manner.
    The farmers said: "After studying the general line of the state during the transition period, we understood that iron is needed to manufacture machines and tractors, so that agricultural production can be better improved." According to preliminary prospecting estimates, the iron ore reserves are at least 2 million tons, all of which are rich ore, with an iron content of about 50 percent. In terms of the geological structure of the ore body and the types of ore, it belongs to the same type as the Qijiang Iron Mine, currently the largest iron mine in the Southwest, and is an iron ore area with great development value. Based on this preliminary survey, the Southwest Geological Bureau decided to include the exploration of the Jielong Township iron ore in Ba County in this year's work plan and will send an exploration team to conduct a general survey.

    四川省巴县接龙乡
    农民帮助预查铁矿
    去年冬天，四川省巴县接龙乡农民学习了国家过渡时期的总路线以后，接连给中央地质部西南地质局写了五封报矿信，随信寄来了二十平方公里地区内的铁矿图样。今年春天，西南地质局派出了十二名地质队员前往预查时，附近的农民都热情地帮助解决住房、吃饭等困难，在清理旧矿洞的时候，需要一些木料，乡人民政府发动农民及时供应。
    农民说：“我们学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线以后，明白了有铁才能制造机器，制造拖拉机，才能更好地提高农业生产。”据初步预查估计：这个铁矿蕴藏量至少有二百万吨，全是富矿，含铁在百分之五十左右。在矿层的地质构造和矿石种类方面，和目前西南最大的铁矿——綦江铁矿是属于同一类型的，是一个很有开采价值的铁矿区。西南地质局根据这个预查，决定把勘探巴县接龙乡铁矿的工作列在今年工作计划之内，将要派出勘探队进行普查。　（李策）
