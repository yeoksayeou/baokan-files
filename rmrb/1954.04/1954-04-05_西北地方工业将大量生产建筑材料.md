Northwest China's local industrial enterprises will produce a large number of building materials and industrial equipment this year to meet the needs of capital construction and large-scale industrial production. For example, cement production will increase by nearly 235 percent, and brick production will increase by more than 60 percent. There are also many types of products. For example, the Xi'an Paint Factory produces more than 150 kinds of paints, and the Refractory Materials Factory produces refractory bricks suitable for various types of furnaces.

The products produced by Northwest local industrial enterprises this year are mainly supplied to various capital construction units and major factories and mines in the Northwest region. For example, the cement produced by the Xinjiang Cement Plant this year is mainly supplied to the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company for drilling; the heat-insulating and fire-resistant asbestos pipes, asbestos clothing, gloves, and asbestos boards produced by the Xinhua Asbestos Plant are mainly supplied to the Yumen Oil Mine and the power departments of some large power plants and textile mills in Guanzhong; the various ceramic pipes and cement pipes produced by the Tongchuan Ceramics Factory and Xi'an No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory are mainly supplied to the industrial and cultural areas in the suburbs of Xi'an for the construction of underground sewers; the Xi'an Paint Factory will produce various paints this year to supply Northwest railway units for painting trains and bridges. The yarn tubes produced by the Baoji Yarn Tube Factory are also mainly supplied to the needs of several large textile mills in Guanzhong.

In order to complete the production plan and ensure that these products are delivered to various capital construction sites and factories in a timely manner, many factories have added new equipment, and workers have launched labor competitions, and both output and quality are constantly improving.

    西北地方工业将大量生产建筑材料
    西北区许多地方工业企业，今年将生产大量建筑材料和工业器材，供给基本建设和大工业生产的需要。如水泥的产量将提高将近百分之二百三十五，砖的产量将提高百分之六十以上。各种产品种类也很多。如西安市油漆制造厂生产的各种油漆就有一百五十多种，耐火材料厂生产的有适合各种式样炉子用的耐火砖。
    西北地方工业企业今年生产的产品，主要是供给西北区各基本建设单位和各大厂矿使用。如新疆水泥厂今年生产的水泥，主要是供给中苏石油公司钻井使用；新华石棉厂生产的保暖防火的石棉管子、石棉衣服、手套和石棉板等，主要是供给玉门油矿和关中的一些大发电厂、纺织厂的动力部门使用；铜川陶瓷厂和西安第一砖瓦厂所生产的各种陶瓷管、水泥管，主要是供给西安市郊工业区、文化区修地下水道使用；西安油漆厂今年生产供给西北各铁路单位油漆火车、桥梁使用的各种油漆。宝鸡纱管厂生产的纱管，也主要是供应关中几个大型纺织厂的需要。
    为了完成生产计划，保证及时把这些产品送到各基本建设工地和各工厂，许多工厂增添了新的设备，职工们纷纷展开了劳动竞赛，产量质量都在不断提高中。
