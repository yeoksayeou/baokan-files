Shaanxi Province Promotes Six Agronomic Technique Reforms This Year

In order to better complete this year's agricultural production increase tasks and support national industrial construction, the Third Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Conference focused on summarizing the agronomic techniques for increasing the production of major crops such as grain and cotton in the province over the past few years. In response to the problems that have existed in this area in various regions, it was decided to promote six techniques:

First, deep plowing, early plowing, and timely harrowing to conserve water and preserve moisture, ensuring timely sowing. In many areas of the province, deep plowing has not yet been achieved due to insufficient draft animals and other reasons. In particular, mountainous areas, which account for more than half of the province's cultivated land, mostly plant seeds directly into untilled soil, making it difficult to increase yields. In order to achieve deep plowing, new agricultural tools should be gradually promoted, and it is advocated to organize and pay attention to solving the difficulties of insufficient labor, animals, and agricultural tools.

Second, rational close planting to ensure full seedlings. In strip-sowing areas, the focus is on promoting narrow-row uniform dense planting; in broadcast-sowing areas, gradually switch to strip-sowing; in dibbling areas, shorten the spacing between hills or promote strip-sowing. The amount of seeds sown should be increased according to different conditions such as soil fertility, irrigated land and dry land, variety characteristics, and sowing time. Prevent and overcome the conservative thinking of not wanting to accept close planting, and oppose the practice of blindly increasing the amount of seeds sown for close planting. Timely carry out seedling inspection and replanting to eliminate broken rows and missing seedlings. At present, the seedling deficiency rate of crops in the province is generally between 20% and 30%. If it is reduced to 10% to 20%, grain production can be increased by 10%. If 50% to 70% of the main crops implement rational close planting, production can also be increased by more than 10%.

Third, select fine varieties and promote fine varieties. In order to continuously supply excellent varieties, each farm should select and breed excellent varieties according to the needs of production development, and carry out demonstration propagation in a planned manner. It is advocated that agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams establish seed-retaining plots.

Fourth, strive to accumulate fertilizer, increase the application of base fertilizer, and rationally apply top dressing. Implement the principle of "farm manure as the main source and commercial fertilizer as a supplement" and develop the habit of accumulating fertilizer.

Fifth, build water conservancy projects and irrigate rationally. Promote rational irrigation according to soil moisture and crop needs. At present, irrigated land in the province accounts for less than one-tenth of all cultivated land. This year, the province will build more than 247,000 mu of irrigated land. After completion, it is estimated that it can increase grain production by more than 10 million jin.

Sixth, actively prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests. Implement the principle of "early treatment, treatment when small, and thorough treatment." Strengthen field inspections and eliminate diseases and insect pests in a timely manner. Mountainous areas should also pay attention to preventing and controlling animal and bird pests.

    陕西省今年推广六项耕作技术改革工作
    为了更好地完成今年的农业增产任务，支援国家工业建设，陕西省第三届农业会议上，曾着重总结了全省几年来增产粮食、棉花等主要作物的耕作技术，并针对各地历年来在这方面所存在的问题，决定推广六项技术：
    第一、深耕、早耕、及时耙耱，蓄水保墒，保证适时下种。全省不少地区，由于耕畜不够等原因，还没有做到深耕。特别是占全省耕地面积一半以上的山区，还多是不耕不耙，硬槎下种，很难提高产量。为了做到深耕，要逐步推广新式农具，并提倡组织起来，注意解决劳畜力、农具不足的困难。
    第二、合理密植，保证全苗。在条播地区，以推广窄行匀播密植为主；撒播地区，逐步改为条播；点播地区缩短窝距或推行条播。并应根据土壤肥瘠、水地旱地、品种特性、播种早晚等不同情况，增加播种量。防止与克服不愿接受密植的保守思想，反对盲目密植增加播种量的作法。及时进行查苗、补苗工作，消灭断条缺苗现象。目前全省庄稼的缺苗率一般在百分之二十到三十。如果降低到百分之十到二十，即可增产粮食百分之十。主要的农作物如果有百分之五十到七十实行合理密植，也可增产百分之十以上。
    第三、选用良种，推广良种。为了不断供应优良品种，各农场应根据生产发展需要，选育优良品种，并有计划地进行示范繁殖。提倡各农业生产合作社、互助组设立留种地。
    第四、努力积肥，增施底肥，合理追肥。贯彻“农家肥料为主，商品肥料为辅”的方针，养成积肥习惯。
    第五、兴修水利，合理灌溉。根据土壤水分和作物需要，推行合理灌溉。现在全省水地还不到全部耕地的十分之一。今年全省要修二十四万七千多亩水地，修成后，估计可增产一千多万斤粮食。
    第六、积极防治作物病虫害。贯彻“治早、治小、治了”的方针。加强田间检查，及时消灭病虫害。山区并应注意防治兽害与鸟害。
