International public opinion demands a successful Geneva Conference and criticizes the US for assembling a Southeast Asian aggression bloc
Revealing the Faces of Those Who Sabotage the Geneva Conference
The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "Nhan Dan" recently published a commentary titled "Revealing the Faces of Those Who Sabotage the Geneva Conference," saying: "The Geneva Conference is about to convene. Peace-loving people all over the world, like the people of Asia, are making unremitting efforts to achieve good results at the Geneva Conference and to further ease international tensions. However, the US imperialist ruling group, led by munitions monopolists, is using every means to continue and expand the war of aggression in Indochina, attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference in order to maintain international tensions."
  The commentary exposed a series of facts about the United States' direct intervention in the Indochina War, and pointed out: The US imperialist ruling group recently made slanderous accusations, falsely claiming that the People's Republic of China "interfered" in the Indochina War. This is a robber's trick of shouting "stop thief!" while stealing, with the aim of finding an excuse to further invade Indochina. The commentary asked: "Who allocated 75 percent of the funds for the war of aggression in Indochina? Who, together with the French colonialists, drew up the Navarre military plan aimed at continuing and expanding the war of aggression? Who recently transported hundreds of pilots, technicians, and many aircraft to Indochina? It is the US imperialist interventionists."
    The commentary concluded: "The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, together with the governments of the three countries, have solemnly exposed the actions of the US government in stepping up direct intervention in Indochina before the people of the world. The Vietnamese people will stand with the people of Cambodia and Laos, and continue to fight for national independence, unity, peace, and democracy. We welcome the Geneva Conference and will fight to make it a success. The aggression of the US warmongers and the French warmongers is doomed to failure."
    The United States Challenges the Independence of the Asian People
    Indian newspapers widely condemned the US plan to establish an aggressive military alliance in Southeast Asia.
    "Indian Express" said in an editorial that, in India's view, this planned alliance is "to support the already decadent colonialism in Indochina, and in this respect, it is regrettable." The newspaper said that the talks between Dulles and Eden in London showed that Eden "has had to make great concessions and has gained very little in return."
    "Free Press" commented on the Dulles-Eden agreement on considering the establishment of a military alliance in Southeast Asia, saying: "We believe this is a challenge to the independence and self-esteem of the Asian people."
    The newspaper said: "It seems that they believe that the hopes of the Asian people, the sentiments of the Asian people, must be subject to the demands of great power politics, and that the Asian people have no right to live a life that contradicts the politics of great powers." The newspaper added: "Apart from Thailand—which has always adopted a compliant attitude in its relations with great powers—and the US servant, the Philippines, no Asian country in this vast region is very keen to join a great power alliance."
    Oppose the US Attempt to Launch a New War
    According to a report in the Karachi "Today," the Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, Shamsul Haque, said that he welcomed the holding of the Geneva Conference and believed that it was "an appropriate step" towards resolving the Far East issue and ending the Indochina War. He said that it is necessary for every country to express its concern for safeguarding peace and to resolve disputes with other countries through consultation rather than through threats of atomic weapons.
    Haque accused certain people in the United States, Britain, and France of attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina War. He called on all peace-loving people to thwart attempts to launch a new war and strive to achieve a ban on all types of weapons of mass destruction.
    Haque concluded: "The Geneva Conference must succeed. The Indochina War must be stopped. The United Nations must become an organization of democratic countries, and the first step in this regard is to admit China."
    The Independence of the Indochinese People Should Be Guaranteed
    The Australian "Tribune" emphasized on the 7th: "Dulles's heinous act of demanding the expansion of the Indochina War on the eve of the Geneva Conference clearly shows that Wall Street does not want peace, but wants war."
    The newspaper said: "Now the US warmongers are interfering in Indochina in accordance with their policy of waging a 'Cold War,' intensifying international tensions, and preparing for a Third World War."
    "Tribune" went on to say: Dulles's characterization of the Indochinese people who are fighting against imperialist countries and for freedom as "aggressors" is clearly an unprecedented definition of "aggression." The newspaper pointed out: "The imperialists are now trying to use these words to cover up their own plans for a war of aggression."
    "Tribune" pointed out: Dulles's slanders against the Soviet Union and China are "lies," and the fact is that "not a single Soviet or Chinese soldier is fighting in Indochina." And "the US rulers have said that their aim is to control Asia indefinitely."
    "Tribune" also wrote under the headline "The Indochinese People Do Not Threaten Us": "Dulles is trying to scare the Australian people into supporting his evil plans." The newspaper said: "The Australian people should not be deceived by Dulles's lies," "Australia must not interfere in Indochina." "Peace-loving Australians should demand a peaceful settlement to ensure that the heroic Indochinese people, who are only fighting for freedom and do not threaten others, enjoy independence."
    Do Not Expand the Indochina War
    The Berlin "Daily Review" published an article on the 21st commenting on the Geneva Conference. The article said, "Peace is indivisible," which may be the best explanation of why public opinion around the world is concerned about the upcoming Geneva Conference to discuss Asian issues. The People's Republic of China will participate in this conference, and it will enjoy the same rights as other major powers at the conference. This is another reason that has aroused worldwide concern about the upcoming Geneva Conference.
    The article said: Peace-loving people all over the world believe that the convocation of the Geneva Conference is a victory, but today they should remain vigilant so that the agreement they are demanding is not undermined. The United States is attempting to undermine the possibility of easing international tensions. However, the united front of people around the world demanding the success of the Geneva Conference is growing stronger. The millions of peace-loving people around the world who once demanded an end to the Korean War are now demanding that the fruits of their efforts ripen in Geneva—demanding that a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue be promoted. And they all know that to ensure their security, it is not to expand the Indochina War, but to end the war and resolve the Indochina issue based on the principles of popular freedom and national independence.

### 各国舆论要求开好日内瓦会议抨击美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团

    各国舆论要求开好日内瓦会议抨击美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团
    揭露日内瓦会议破坏者的面目
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近一期以“揭露日内瓦会议的破坏者的面目”为题，发表评论说：“日内瓦会议快要召开了。全世界爱好和平的人民和亚洲人民一样，正在为了使日内瓦会议取得良好的结果，为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，进行不懈的努力。但是，以制造军火的垄断资本家为首的美帝国主义统治集团正在用尽一切手段，来继续并扩大对印度支那的侵略战争，企图破坏日内瓦会议，以保持国际紧张局势。”
  评论揭发了美国一连串的直接干涉印度支那战争的事实，并指出：美帝国主义统治集团最近竟含血喷人、诬蔑中华人民共和国“干涉”印度支那战争，这是一种强盗的伎俩，它一面偷东西，一面喊捉贼，目的是寻找借口以便进一步侵略印度支那。评论问道：“谁拨付侵略印度支那战争费用的百分之七十五？谁和法国殖民者一起拟订了目的在于继续并扩大侵略战争的纳瓦尔军事计划？谁在最近把几百个飞行员、技术员和许多飞机增运到印度支那去？正是美帝国主义干涉者。”
    评论最后指出：“越南、高棉和寮国人民与三国人民的政府曾经在全世界人民面前严正地揭露美国政府加紧直接干涉印度支那的行动。越南人民将与高棉和寮国人民在一起，继续为民族的独立、统一与和平、民主而斗争。我们欢迎日内瓦会议，并将为使日内瓦会议取得良好的结果而斗争。美国战争贩子和法国主战派的侵略注定要失败。”
    美国向亚洲人民的独立挑战
    印度报纸普遍谴责美国打算在东南亚建立侵略军事同盟的计划。
    “印度快报”在社论中说：在印度看来，这个计划中的联盟是“为了支持印度支那的已经腐朽的殖民主义，并且从这方面来说，是令人惋惜的。”该报说：杜勒斯和艾登在伦敦的会谈显示出，艾登“已经不得不作很大的让步，而得到的好处却很少”。
    “自由新闻”在评论杜勒斯、艾登关于考虑在东南亚建立军事同盟的协议时说：“我们认为这是对于亚洲人民的独立和自尊的一种挑战。”
    该报说：“看来他们认为，亚洲人民的希望，亚洲人民的情绪，必须要服从于大国政策的要求，并且认为亚洲人民没有权利过一种和大国政策相矛盾的生活。”该报又说：“除了泰国——它在和大国的关系上始终是采取顺从态度的——和美国的仆从菲律宾之外，在这个广大的地区中是没有一个亚洲国家非常希望参加大国联盟的。”
    反对美国发动新战争的企图
    据喀喇蚩“今天报”报道，全巴基斯坦和平委员会秘书长山萨姆尔·哈伊说，他欢迎日内瓦会议的举行，并认为它是走向解决远东问题和结束印度支那战争的“一个适当的步骤”。他说，目前每个国家有必要表示它对保障和平的关怀，并通过协商、而不是用原子武器威胁来解决与其他国家的争端。
    哈伊指责美、英、法的某些人士企图破坏日内瓦会议和扩大印度支那战争。他号召所有爱好和平的人民粉碎发动新战争的企图，争取实现禁止各种类型的大规模毁灭性武器。
    哈伊最后说：“日内瓦会议必须成功。印度支那战争必须停止。联合国必须成为一个民主国家的组织，而它在这方面的第一个步骤就是接纳中国。”
    应该保证印度支那人民的独立
    澳大利亚“论坛报”七日强调说：“杜勒斯在日内瓦会议前夕要求扩大印度支那战争的罪恶行为，清楚地说明华尔街不希望和平，而希望战争。”
    该报说：“现在美国战争贩子按照他们进行的
  ‘冷战’、加剧国际紧张气氛和准备第三次世界大战的政策，正在干涉印度支那。”
    “论坛报”接着说：杜勒斯把正在为反对帝国主义国家、争取自由而战斗的印度支那人民说成“侵略者”，这显然是一个前所未有的“侵略”定义。该报指出：“帝国主义者现在企图用这些话来掩饰他们自己的侵略战争计划。”
    “论坛报”指出：杜勒斯诬蔑苏联和中国的话是“谎话”，事实是“没有一个苏联和中国兵士在印度支那作战”。而“美国统治者已经说过，他们的目的是要无限期控制亚洲”。
    “论坛报”并在“印度支那人民没有威胁我们”的题目下，写道：“杜勒斯企图吓唬澳大利亚人民，使他们支持他的罪恶计划。”该报说：“澳大利亚人民不要为杜勒斯的谎话所骗”，“澳大利亚决不要干涉印度支那”。“澳大利亚爱好和平的人们应该要求实现和平解决，来保证仅仅为自由而战、并不威胁他人的英勇的印度支那人民享受独立。”
    不要扩大印度支那战争
    柏林“每日评论报”二十一日发表了一篇文章，评论日内瓦会议。文章说，“和平是不可分割的”，这句话可能是世界各地舆论为什么都关心即将举行的讨论亚洲问题的日内瓦会议的最好的解释。这个会议将有中华人民共和国参加，而且它在会上将享有与其他大国同样的权利。这是引起全世界关心即将举行的日内瓦会议的又一个原因。
    文章说：全世界爱好和平的人民认为，日内瓦会议的召开就是一个胜利，但是今天，他们应该保持警惕，以免他们要求达成的协议遭到破坏。美国就正企图破坏国际紧张局势缓和的可能性。但是，世界各国人民要求日内瓦会议成功的联合阵线正在日益加强。全世界曾经要求结束朝鲜战争的千千万万爱好和平的人民现在要求他们的努力所结成的果实在日内瓦成熟——要求促成朝鲜问题的和平解决。他们并且都知道，要使他们的安全得到保证，不是要扩大印度支那战争，而是要结束战争和根据人民自由与民族独立的原则来解决印度支那问题。                      （据新华社讯）
