A Large Number of District and Township People's Representatives in Chongqing Enthusiastically Serve the Masses

The district and township people's representatives elected in the general election in Chongqing pay great attention to the lives of the masses, enthusiastically serve the masses, and play a leading role in various tasks. In the general election in Chongqing, three thousand and forty-six district and township people's representatives were elected. After being elected, they generally strengthened their sense of responsibility as masters of the country and played an active leading role in various tasks. Hu Hanmin, a fitter and People's Representative at the Chongqing Power Plant construction site, noticed a sudden drop in the water level of the sedimentation tank during the recent trial operation of the plant, posing a danger of boiler water shortage and explosion. Knowing this, Hu Hanmin quickly ran to the kitchen, grabbed a bucket, and jumped into the sedimentation tank to bail water. Due to his leadership, surrounding workers and engineers also jumped into the sedimentation tank and scooped water towards the boiler's outlet, ensuring the smooth completion of the trial operation. Luo Guangqian, chairman of the Jinchumen Wharf Committee, became even more active in his work after being elected as a People's Representative. He organized a labor competition among the porters, which improved handling efficiency and ensured that it was "safe, fast, and timely." People's Representatives from Chongqing No. 610 Yarn Factory and Yuxin Textile Factory all conducted thorough investigations when formulating this year's second-quarter production plans and developed advanced production plans. People's Representatives from Xiaoshi Village, Xinxing Township, Fifth District, also helped rectify the township's thirteen temporary mutual aid teams and developed six year-round mutual aid teams. Some year-round mutual aid teams with a better foundation have developed into agricultural producers' cooperatives with the help of the People's Representatives.

People's Representatives in the streets have also done many good things for the masses. People's Representative Li Jiayun, when publicizing the general line, coordinated with the grassroots organizations in the Xuetianwan neighborhood and organized six mobile propaganda teams, including more than two hundred and twenty people, to publicize the general line to the people. Li Jiayun also reorganized the political study classes and newspaper reading groups in the neighborhood. Through these organizations, voters were able to express their opinions in a timely manner. Lu Bixian, a People's Representative from the Twelfth Section of the Guanyinyan Police Station in the First District, recently assisted the families of workers in the section in carrying out the "Five Goods" work (encouraging husbands to produce well, planning their lives well, helping each other and uniting well, educating their children well, and studying well themselves). She visited and explained the meaning of the "Five Goods" to the families of workers almost every day, which has gradually reduced the situations in many workers' families where quarrels often occurred and affected production. The families of workers also regularly participated in the section's current affairs and cultural studies. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆市大批区乡人民代表热心为群众办事
    重庆市在普选中选出的区乡人民代表，非常注意关心群众生活，热心为群众办事，并在各项工作中发挥了带头作用。重庆市在普选中选出了三千零四十六名区乡人民代表，他们当选后普遍加强了当家作主的责任感，在各项工作中起着积极带头作用。建设重庆电力厂的钳工、人民代表胡汉民，在最近该厂试运转时，沉淀池的水位骤降，锅炉有缺水爆炸的危险，胡汉民知道了，赶紧跑进厨房提着水桶跳下沉淀池戽水。由于他的带头，周围的工人、工程师都跳入沉淀池把水向通往锅炉的出水口戽去，保证了试运转的顺利完成。金储门码头委员会主席罗光前在当选为人民代表后，工作更加积极，他组织了搬运工人开展劳动竞赛，使搬运效率提高，做到了“又安全、又快当、又及时”。重庆六一零纱厂、渝新纺织厂的人民代表在制定今年第二季度生产计划时，都深入了解情况，订出了先进的生产计划。第五区新兴乡小石村的人民代表，还帮助该乡十三个临时互助组进行整顿，并发展了六个常年互助组。有些基础较好的常年互助组在人民代表的帮助下，已发展为农业生产合作社。
    街道中的人民代表也为群众办了许多好事。人民代表李嘉芸在宣传总路线时，和学田湾街道中的基层组织联系好，组织了包括二百二十多人的六个流动宣传队，向人民宣传总路线。李嘉芸还把街道中的政治学习班、读报组加以整顿，通过这些组织使选民能够及时反映意见。第一区观音岩派出所第十二段人民代表吕碧仙，最近在段上协助工人家属开展“五好”工作（鼓励丈夫生产好，日子计划好，互助团结好，教养孩子好，自己学习好），差不多每天都要到工人家属家里去拜访和讲解“五好”的意义，使许多工人的家庭过去因为常常发生争吵而影响生产的情形已日渐减少。工人家属们还经常参加了段上的时事、文化学习。　（新华社）
