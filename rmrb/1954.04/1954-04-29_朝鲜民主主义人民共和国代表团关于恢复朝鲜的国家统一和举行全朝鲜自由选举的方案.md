The Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Proposal on Restoring National Unification and Holding Free All-Korea Elections

In order to rapidly restore the national unification of Korea and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state:

(I) It is proposed to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the Republic of Korea:

	A. To hold all-Korea elections for the National Assembly based on the free expression of the will of all Korean residents, in order to form a unified government of Korea.

	B. To prepare for and hold free all-Korea elections for the Korean National Assembly, and to take urgent measures to promote economic and cultural rapprochement between North and South Korea, a Pan-Korean Committee should be formed by representatives from North and South Korea respectively selected by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea. The committee should include representatives from the largest democratic social organizations in North and South Korea.

	C. One of the current tasks of the Pan-Korean Committee should be to draft an all-Korea election law to ensure that elections are truly democratic, held under free conditions excluding foreign interference and pressure from local authorities and terrorist groups on voters. The committee should take necessary measures to guarantee Korean residents freedom of assembly and publication, and the freedom of all citizens within the country, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, gender, or ethnicity, to nominate candidates for legislative bodies.

	D. In order to promote the recovery of the Korean economy, improve the material welfare of the Korean people, and protect and develop its national culture, as an important step in creating the necessary conditions for achieving Korean national unification, the Pan-Korean committee should immediately take measures to establish and develop economic and cultural ties between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, namely: trade, financial settlements, transportation, border relations, freedom of movement and communication for residents, scientific and cultural exchanges, and others.

(II) Deem it necessary for all foreign armed forces to withdraw from Korea within six months.

(III) Deem it necessary for the relevant countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thereby create conditions to promote the speedy completion of the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic nation.

We believe that the implementation of the steps mentioned in our proposal can guarantee a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will simultaneously contribute to guaranteeing peace and security in the Far East and easing tensions in international relations.

    为迅速恢复朝鲜的国家统一，并建立一个统一的、独立的和民主的朝鲜国家：
    （一）向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和大韩民国政府建议：
    甲、在全朝鲜居民表示自由意志的基础上，举行国民议会的全朝鲜选举，以组成朝鲜的统一政府。
    乙、为筹备与举行朝鲜国民议会的全朝鲜自由选举，并采取紧急措施促使南北朝鲜之间的经济及文化的接近，由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和大韩民国国会各自选派的南北朝鲜的代表组成全朝鲜委员会。该委员会应包括南北朝鲜最大的民主的社会团体代表。
    丙、全朝鲜委员会的当前任务之一应该是草拟一个全朝鲜选举法草案，以保证选举得以在排除外国干涉及地方政权当局和恐怖集团对选民施加压力的自由条件下举行的真正民主性。委员会应采取必要措施，以保证朝鲜居民的集会、出版的自由，和国内一切公民不分政治见解、宗教信仰、性别和民族，推选立法机关候选人的自由。
    丁、为促进朝鲜经济的恢复，提高朝鲜人民的物质福利，保护并发展其民族文化，作为创造必要条件以实现朝鲜国家统一的重要步骤，全朝鲜委员会应立即采取措施建立并发展朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的经济及文化联系，即：贸易、财政结算、运输、边境关系、居民的通行和通信自由、科学和文化交流及其他。
    （二）认为有必要使一切外国武装力量，在六个月内撤出朝鲜。
    （三）认为对维护远东和平具有最大关心的相应国家有必要保证朝鲜的和平发展，并从而有必要创造条件以促使尽速完成以和平方式把朝鲜统一成为一个统一的、独立的、民主的国家的任务。
    我们认为在我们的方案中所提到的步骤的实施，能够保证和平解决朝鲜问题。朝鲜问题的和平解决同时将对保障远东的和平与安全以及缓和国际关系中的紧张局势作出贡献。
