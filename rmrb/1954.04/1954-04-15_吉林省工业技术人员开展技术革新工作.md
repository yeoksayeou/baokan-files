Industrial technicians in Jilin Province are conscientiously studying advanced Soviet experiences, closely integrating with workers, and actively carrying out technical innovations. Chen Hanmin, a technician from the installation team of the Northeast Hydropower Engineering Company participating in the construction of the Fengman Hydropower Station, created a hot air generator and a wind turbine under the guidance of Soviet experts and with the support of workers, solving the generator testing problem. Wu Guoxi, a construction worker at the Huadian Water Conservancy Project Office, created an aerial automatic transport machine, reducing the physical labor of workers and increasing work efficiency by seven times. Qin Shiliang, a technician at the state-owned Jilin Paper Mill, created a sand washing machine and a sand screening machine, replacing heavy physical labor with machinery. Technicians in local state-owned industrial departments have also carried out many creative technical reforms. For example, the "New Rural Village" and "Full House Red" toothpastes produced by the Daily Chemical Factory have been researched and improved, and are now high-quality toothpastes.

In the process of carrying out technical innovations, the technicians have had closer contact with the masses of workers, which has promoted the development of technical innovation work. In the past year alone, construction workers in the province, with the cooperation of technicians, have created more than 20 kinds of advanced tools. Since the launch of the General Line study and the promotion of the production innovation movement, workers and technicians in various factories and mines in Jilin City have closely cooperated in carrying out 32 relatively major technical reforms in 43 days. These innovations have played a significant role in reforming outdated equipment, improving working conditions, and transforming manual operations into mechanized production.

    吉林省工业技术人员开展技术革新工作
    吉林省基本建设单位和生产厂矿中的技术人员认真学习苏联先进经验，和工人密切结合，积极进行技术革新。参加丰满水电站建设的东北水电工程公司安装队技术员陈汉民，在苏联专家的指导和工人的支持下，创造了热风器和风力透平机，解决了发电机试验问题；桦甸水利工程处施工员吴国玺创造了空中自动运输机，减轻了工人的体力劳动，提高工作效率七倍。国营吉林造纸厂技术员秦士亮创造了洗沙机和筛沙机，用机械代替了繁重的体力劳动。地方国营工业部门的技术人员也进行了许多创造性的技术改革，如日用化学厂出产的“新农村”和“满堂红”牙膏，经过研究改进，现已成为优等质量的牙膏。
    技术人员们在进行技术革新中，和工人群众有了更密切的联系，这就促进了技术革新工作的开展。去年一年，该省基本建设工人就在技术人员的配合下，创造了二十多种先进工具。自从开展总路线学习、推广生产革新运动以后，在四十三天的时间内，吉林市各厂矿工人和技术人员就密切配合，进行了三十二件比较重大的技术改革。这些革新，对于改革陈旧设备、改善劳动条件、变手工操作为机械化生产都有很大作用。
