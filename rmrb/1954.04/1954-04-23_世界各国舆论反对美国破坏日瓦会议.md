World Public Opinion Opposes U.S. Sabotage of the Geneva Conference
The Closer the Conference Date, the More Shameless the U.S. Clamor
London's "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 20th, condemning the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference. The editorial pointed out that Dulles threatened to refuse a ceasefire in Indochina, refused to hold any real negotiations to seek a peaceful settlement, and threatened never to recognize the People's Government of China.
The editorial stated: The closer the date of the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean and Indochina issues, the more shamelessly the U.S. government announces that it will make the conference fail. U.S. Vice President Nixon, in his speech to the American Newspaper Editors Association, openly refused to negotiate with the Soviet Union and China to resolve the Far East issue, and openly stated that if the French government wanted to abandon the Indochina war, the U.S. government is now prepared to intervene with its own troops and wage the Indochina war.
The "Daily Worker" called on British workers to take concrete measures at this critical time to show the British government their attitude.

The U.S. Wants to Make the Conference End Fruitlessly
Indonesian public opinion condemned the series of conspiracies recently carried out by the United States to sabotage the Geneva Conference.
Jakarta's "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 21st, pointing out that the purpose of the recent U.S. actions is to poison the atmosphere so that the Geneva Conference will end fruitlessly. The United States is attempting to take "joint action" with other countries and issue joint warnings to the People's Republic of China. Its intention is: First, to gather the imperialist forces of Britain, France, and others to frustrate the Vietnamese people's resistance and打击打击 打击 the democratic forces in Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia; Second, to tie Britain, France, and other countries to the U.S. chariot; Third, to use Southeast Asian countries as a base for attacking China.
The newspaper said that the United States is trying to turn Vietnam into a second Korea and seize control of Southeast Asia's resources and manpower.
The newspaper pointed out that the world's peace forces are growing stronger. It forces the warmongers to negotiate initially in Korea, then in Berlin, and now in Geneva. Peace-loving people all hope for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue and hope for the success of the Geneva Conference.
"Dongxing Daily" commented on the 20th on the statement made by U.S. Vice President Nixon about the possible dispatch of U.S. troops to Indochina, saying, "Direct U.S. intervention in Indochina will undermine world peace. The reason why the United States is stepping up its intervention in Indochina is for its own political interests and influence in Southeast Asia."
"Great Indonesia Daily" pointed out on the 20th that the purpose of the United States' recent activities in Europe and Asia is to try to obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference. The newspaper said: "In Asia, the United States is desperately piecing together an anti-communist defense alliance. U.S. officials have even suggested that if France is defeated, the United States should send troops to Indochina. In the United States, it seems that someone is creating public opinion for taking such action." The newspaper then wrote: "Obviously, the Geneva Conference is of great significance. The outcome of the conference will directly affect the status of Indonesia, this Southeast Asian country."

We Must Force Dulles to Negotiate Seriously in Geneva
The U.S. "People's World" published an editorial on the 16th, calling on the American people to stop Dulles' conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina war.
The editorial pointed out that it is clear that Dulles went to Europe to obstruct the possibility of achieving peace in the Far East at any cost, and to maintain the shackles on the Indochinese people at any cost. There is no doubt that Dulles' purpose in this trip is to sabotage the Geneva Conference convened for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and ending the war in Indochina.
The editorial said: Dulles believes that a peaceful settlement of the Indochina war is a disaster, and he wants to use various methods (including direct military intervention by the United States and its allies and expanding the war) to obstruct its realization.
The editorial said: At the same time, it can also be seen that if his plan to obstruct an agreement in Geneva succeeds, he will more stubbornly try to get the United States to enter the war with the consent of Britain and France, and take aggressive action against China.
The overriding importance of the Geneva Conference lies here. Its success can pave the way for peace in the Far East. Its failure may be used by Dulles to advance his conspiracy to ignite the flames of war in the Far East, and perhaps even the world.
The editorial said: Of course, what the American people expect from this conference is exactly the opposite of what Dulles expects. They do not want the United States to be involved in the Indochina war. They do not want another Korean war in Southeast Asia. They are unwilling to sacrifice their children to keep a nation in colonial bondage. They do not want to increase the risk of a world war with hydrogen bombs. If Dulles' interest lies in making the conference fail, peace, for the interests of the American people, requires the American people to help make the conference a success.
The editorial pointed out that the pressure from the British and French people has already forced their governments to at least express some resistance to Dulles' belligerent conspiracies. The pressure from the American people can stop Dulles' plan to join the Indochina war and force him to negotiate seriously in Geneva. If there is such a time when the American people can help reverse the world situation in favor of peace, now is the time. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 世界各国舆论反对美国破坏日瓦会议

    世界各国舆论反对美国破坏日瓦会议
    会期愈近美国的叫嚣愈厚颜无耻
    伦敦“工人日报”二十日发表社论，谴责美国阴谋破坏日内瓦会议。社论指出，杜勒斯扬言要拒绝在印度支那停火、拒绝为谋求和平解决而举行任何真正的谈判，并扬言决不承认中国的人民政府。
    社论说：讨论朝鲜与印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的会期越是临近，美国政府就越是厚颜无耻地宣布要使会议失败。美国副总统尼克松在美国报纸编辑协会上发表的演说中公然拒绝与苏联和中国谈判以解决远东问题，并公开表明，假如法国政府要放弃印度支那战争的话，美国政府现在准备用自己的军队来干涉和进行印度支那战争。
    “工人日报”号召在这个危急的时候英国工人采取具体措施向英国政府表明他们的态度。
    美国要使会议无结果而散
    印尼舆论谴责美国最近进行的破坏日内瓦会议的一系列阴谋活动。
    雅加达“人民日报”二十一日发表的评论指出，美国最近的行动的目的，是要毒化气氛，以使日内瓦会议无结果而散。美国企图使其他国家与它采取“联合行动”，并对中华人民共和国提出联合警告，它的意图是：一、纠集英国、法国等帝国主义势力，来挫败越南人民的抗战与打击东南亚国家——包括印尼在内——的民主力量；二、把英法等国绑在美国的战车上；三、利用东南亚国家作为进攻中国的基地。
    该报说，美国企图把越南变成第二个朝鲜，并且夺取对东南亚资源与人力的控制权。
    该报指出，世界和平力量日益壮大。它迫使战争贩子们不得不最初在朝鲜，后来在柏林，现在在日内瓦举行谈判。爱好和平的人民都希望和平解决印度支那问题、希望日内瓦会议成功。
    “东星报”二十日评论美国副总统尼克松所发表的可能派遣美国军队到印度支那去的声明时说，“美国对印度支那的直接干涉会破坏世界和平。美国所以要加紧干涉印度支那，是为了它自己在东南亚的政治利益和势力。”
    “大印度尼西亚报”二十日指出，美国近来在欧洲和亚洲的活动的目的是企图阻挠日内瓦会议的进行。该报说：“在亚洲，美国正在拚命拼凑反共防御同盟。美国的负责官员甚至建议，如果法国遭到失败，美国就派遣军队到印度支那去。在美国，似乎有人正在为采取这种行动制造舆论。”该报接着写道：“显然，日内瓦会议是具有重大意义的。会议的结果将直接影响到印度尼西亚这个东南亚国家的地位。”
    必须迫使杜勒斯在日内瓦认真谈判
    美国“人民世界报”十六日发表社论，号召美国人民制止杜勒斯破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。
    社论指出，很明显，杜勒斯到欧洲去是为了不惜任何代价阻挠在远东实现和平的可能，并不惜任何代价保持对印度支那人民的束缚。毫无疑问，杜勒斯此行的目的是要破坏为了和平解决朝鲜问题及结束印度支那的战争而召开的日内瓦会议。
    社论说：杜勒斯认为印度支那战争的和平解决是一种灾祸，他要用各种方法（包括美国及其盟国的直接军事干涉和把战争扩大）来阻挠其实现。
    社论说：同时还可以看出，如果他阻挠在日内瓦达成协议的打算得逞的话，他将更加顽固地努力使美国在英国和法国的同意下进入战争，并对中国采取侵略行动。
    日内瓦会议的压倒一切的重要意义就在于此。它的成功可以为远东和平铺平道路。它的失败可能被杜勒斯利用来推进他的在远东、甚至或许在全世界燃起战火的阴谋。
    社论说：当然，美国人民所期望于这个会议的是和杜勒斯的期望正好相反的。他们不要美国卷入印度支那战争。他们不要在东南亚再有一个朝鲜战争。他们不愿意为了使一个民族受到殖民束缚而牺牲他们的子弟。他们不要以氢弹来增加发生世界大战的危险。如果杜勒斯的利益在于使会议失败的话，和平对于美国人民的利益却要求美国人民帮助使会议获得成功。
    社论指出，英法人民的压力已经迫使他们的政府不得不对杜勒斯的好战阴谋至少表示了部分的反抗。美国人民的压力能够制止杜勒斯的加入印度支那战争的计划，并迫使他在日内瓦认真地进行谈判。如果有这么一个时候，美国人民能够帮助扭转世界形势使其有利于和平的话，现在就是这个时候了。（新华社）
