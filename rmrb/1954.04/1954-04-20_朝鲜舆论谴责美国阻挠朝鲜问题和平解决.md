Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: Korean public opinion continues to condemn the United States' conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference and obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The "Minju Choson" newspaper published an editorial on the 18th, pointing out that as the Geneva Conference is about to be held, peace-loving people all over the world are intensifying their struggle to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the US imperialists are unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Instead, they are intensifying their provocative actions, attempting to exacerbate international tensions. The US side will conduct three large-scale military exercises in Korea starting on the 20th. Prior to this, the US side had illegally transported a large number of war materials to equip the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in the Far East, Hull, had conducted a series of conspiratorial activities in South Korea. The United States conducted hydrogen bomb explosion tests in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The United States is also putting pressure on Britain and France. Dulles visited London and Paris, doing everything possible to obstruct the cessation of the war in Indochina and attempting to turn it into a second Korean War.

    The editorial pointed out that the purpose of the United States in creating a series of provocative acts on the eve of the Geneva Conference is to sabotage the Geneva Conference. The editorial emphasized that such provocative acts by the US imperialists will not only fail to intimidate peace-loving people all over the world, but will only arouse their anger and will inevitably be crushed by the powerful forces of peace-loving people all over the world.

    "Rodong Sinmun" pointed out in its editorial on the 18th that recently, the US ruling clique has been frequently and shamelessly creating incidents in Korea that violate the Armistice Agreement, instigating the Syngman Rhee gang to intensify their clamor for a "northward advance," slandering the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, threatening its existence, and attempting to deepen the instability of the Korean armistice, continuing to implement their policy of aggression against Korea. The US ruling clique is also attempting to use the Syngman Rhee gang to sabotage the Geneva Conference and, furthermore, to completely destroy the Korean armistice.

    The editorial wrote: All the Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, denounce the despicable actions taken by the US imperialists and demand that the US side immediately cease these actions. The Korean people have the active support of peace-loving people all over the world. The Korean people are determined to make their utmost efforts to smash all kinds of conspiracies and plans of the US ruling clique, defend the achievements of the Korean armistice, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    朝鲜舆论谴责美国阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜舆论继续谴责美国破坏日内瓦会议、阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的阴谋。
    “民主朝鲜报”十八日发表社论指出：在日内瓦会议行将召开之际，全世界爱好和平人民正为实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而加紧进行着斗争。然而，美帝国主义者却不愿和平解决朝鲜问题，反在加紧进行挑衅行动，力图加剧国际紧张局势。美方要从二十日起在朝鲜举行三次大规模的军事演习。在此以前，美方曾非法运入大批作战物资，用来装备李承晚伪军。远东美军总司令赫尔曾到南朝鲜进行一连串的阴谋活动。美国在太平洋马绍尔群岛曾进行氢弹爆炸试验。美国并对英国和法国施加着压力。杜勒斯访问了伦敦和巴黎，百般阻挠着印度支那战争的停止，并企图把它变为第二个朝鲜战争。
    社论指出：美国在日内瓦会议召开前夕制造一连串挑衅行为的目的就是要破坏日内瓦会议。社论强调说：但是，美帝国主义者的这种挑衅行为不但吓不倒全世界爱好和平的人民，反而只会激起他们的愤怒，并必将被全世界爱好和平人民的强大力量所粉碎。
    “劳动新闻”在十八日的社论中指出：最近，美国统治集团正在朝鲜频繁而无耻地制造着违反停战协定的事件，指使李承晚匪帮加紧叫嚣“向北进军”，中伤中立国监察委员会，威胁着它的存在，企图加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，继续执行对朝鲜的侵略政策。美国统治集团并且企图利用李承晚匪帮来破坏日内瓦会议，进而全面地破坏朝鲜停战。
    社论写道：全体朝鲜人民与全世界爱好和平人民一道，痛斥美帝国主义者所采取的这种卑鄙的行动，都要求美方迅速中止这种行动。朝鲜人民有着全世界爱好和平人民的积极声援。朝鲜人民决心尽最大的努力来粉碎美国统治集团的各种阴谋策划，捍卫朝鲜停战的成果，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。
