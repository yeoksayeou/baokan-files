World's Largest Textile Factory Under Construction
Soviet Union, Qiumakov

    Kamyshin, an ancient Russian city, winds along the high banks of the Volga River, 160 kilometers from Stalingrad.

    The world's largest integrated textile factory is under construction here.

    Our car bypassed the city streets, speeding along the highway, overtaking trucks carrying stones, cement, and bricks. Soon, a vast foundation pit, sheltered from the wind by hills, unfolded before us. The pit was filled with activity and the noise of work. The long arms of tower cranes stretched everywhere, and buildings with dense scaffolding stood tall. A city for the integrated textile factory workers is being built here. It is estimated that it will house 50,000 residents upon completion. Currently, dozens of well-equipped stone houses, clubs, schools, shops, nurseries, kindergartens, bathhouses, and hospitals have been built. This small city has electric lights and radio installations. New trees have been planted in the streets and courtyards of the houses.

    Builders of the integrated factory have come from all corners of the Soviet Union to contribute their labor to this new, massive project in the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    The construction of the textile workers' city continues at a high speed. This year, the city will add another 25,000 square meters of housing space, as well as a new cinema and a cultural palace with a hall that can accommodate 1,000 spectators, a library, a reading room, a gymnasium, and many spaces for amateur art troupes to perform. In addition, plans are in place to build six middle schools, each capable of accommodating 1,000 students, fifteen nurseries, and seventeen kindergartens for the children of textile workers.

    The first floors of these buildings are equipped with shops, cafes, barbershops, and other daily necessities. There is also a sanatorium in the park.

    There will be many plants and flowers in the textile workers' city, and a large forest belt will separate the integrated factory buildings from the residential areas. To the east of the city's suburbs is the Stalingrad Sea, created by the construction of the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station.

    The builders of the integrated textile factory are working simultaneously at various construction sites. Not only is the workers' city growing rapidly, but also various factories such as concrete and woodworking plants are being built further away from the city. A huge production base has been built. Currently, the first textile factory with tens of thousands of spindles is under construction.

    At the construction site of this factory, I met Nikolai Bakharev, the work team leader of the concrete workers, whose team is known for its Stakhanovite-style labor. Nikolai Bakharev came here two years ago without any special skills, hoping only to become an ordinary bricklayer. His ideal was quickly realized. Various training classes to cultivate skilled workers were established at the construction site. After studying bricklaying in the training class, Nikolai Bakharev worked on building houses and used his spare time in the evenings to study concrete work, and he soon became a work team leader.

    Bakharev told me, "There are many girls in my work team from Voronezh. They originally didn't have any special skills, but now they have become very good concrete workers. We have completed more than 150% of our work plan. In order for the country to get the products of our integrated factory faster, we must work even harder. After work every day, we hold short production meetings to discuss work summaries, expose shortcomings, and exchange experiences. These are very helpful to us."

    At the factory's construction site, the young female concrete workers of Raisa Kasyanova's work team are also working excellently. They also came from far away. After a short period of work, they mastered construction techniques and developed a real enthusiasm for the work they do. Kasyanova said, "We have decided not to leave here under any circumstances. We want to build the integrated factory, and we also want to stay in the workshop and become weavers in the future."

    The main force building the integrated factory is young workers. Young men and women operate excavators, bulldozers, and cranes. They also pour concrete and build the walls of buildings. I spoke with many young workers, and they all love their construction projects and plan to permanently connect themselves with the integrated textile factory, hoping to become textile workers. Of course, their ideals will be realized.

    At one construction site, I met Engineer Alexei Sushkin, the director of the integrated factory under construction. He is a short, fifty-year-old man. He is full of energy and moves very quickly. He proudly and excitedly introduced to us the huge textile factory that is being born: "Our integrated textile factory will be the largest textile factory in the world. It has four spinning mills, four weaving mills, and two processing factories. The production capacity of the integrated factory will be one million yards of various fabrics per day. In other words, it will produce enough textiles to sew 150,000 sets of clothes per day. The products produced by this integrated factory each year can circle the Earth's equator seven and a half times.

    These products do not need to be transported far, and can be sold in the southeastern region of the Soviet Union. Because consumers are close to us, we have studied their needs and interests to determine what kind of fabrics to produce and process. Now that people are living more prosperous lives, there is less demand for plain fabrics. People demand better quality and more beautiful textiles. Therefore, we will produce silk, linen, satin, special veils, flannel, velvet, and cotton velvet. Of course, we will also try to tailor the patterns and colors of cotton fabrics to suit consumers' interests."

    The director told me, "The large amount of cotton fiber needed by the integrated textile factory will initially come from Central Asia, and will gradually be replaced by local raw cotton. After the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station is completed, the semi-desert areas along the coast of the Sea of Azov will be irrigated, so cotton can be planted in its vicinity in the future. In this way, the integrated factory will be close to both the source of raw materials and a cheap supply of electricity, and it will not need to transport the finished products far away.

    Various machine manufacturing factories in the Soviet Union have manufactured various machines and equipment for the Kamyshin integrated textile factory. In the future, the entire factory will use the latest machines that have never been used in the textile industry before. Due to the characteristics of textile production, various transportation equipment is needed inside the workshop and between various parts of the factory. Therefore, we will use pneumatic transport, conveyor belts, and transfer machines on a large scale. In the future, the various automated machines in the factory will control complex technical procedures. In the spacious and bright workshops, people will manage the machines, which have freed workers from heavy physical labor."

    Because this enterprise will fully utilize new machines, about a thousand engineers and technicians will be needed in the future. The management office of the integrated factory has decided to send five hundred young men and women from Kamyshin who work in the factory to various technical schools to study. In order to train skilled textile workers, a textile technical school and a factory apprentice school will soon be opened in Kamyshin…

    At night, when I left, the entire construction site was brightly lit. A huge red star—the symbol that the builders of the integrated factory have completed today's plan—shone above the young textile workers' city. I know that the red star will continue to shine tomorrow and in the days to come. The builders of the Kamyshin integrated textile factory are selflessly dedicating all their strength to ensure that this huge textile factory can be put into operation this autumn.

    世界最大的纺织工厂在建设中
    苏联  邱马科夫
    在距离斯大林格勒一百六十公里的伏尔加河右岸的高山上，蜿蜒着俄罗斯的古城卡米新。
    世界上最大的联合纺织工厂正在这里兴建。
    我们的汽车绕过城市的街道，沿着公路疾驶，赶过了载运着石块、水泥和砖的卡车。不久，面前就展开了一个广阔的被山丘挡住了风的基坑。基坑中充满了活动和工作的嘈杂声。塔形起重机的长臂到处伸展，扎着密密层层建筑架的楼房耸立着。这里正建设着联合纺织工厂工人们的城市。估计将来完工时这里要住五万居民。现在，数十所设备完善的石头房屋、俱乐部、学校、商店、托儿所、幼儿园、澡塘和医院已经建筑起来了。这个规模不大的城市有电灯和无线电装置。在街道和房屋的院落里，都新栽了树木。
    联合工厂的建筑者们来自苏维埃国家的各个角落，为的是要把自己的一份劳动投入第五个五年计划中最巨大的一个新的工程中去。
    纺织工人城市的建筑，继续以高速度在进行着。今年这个城市还要增加二万五千平方公尺的住房面积，并且还要建筑一座新电影院和带有能容纳一千观众的大厅、图书馆、阅览室、体育馆和很多供业余艺术剧团活动的场所的文化宫。此外，还计划为纺织工人的子女建筑六所每所能容纳一千学生的中学，十五个托儿所和十七个幼儿园。
    在这些楼房的第一层，配置有商店、咖啡店、理发店和其他日常生活所必要的设施。公园中还设有夜间疗养所。
    在纺织工人的城市里，将有很多种植物和花卉，广大的植林带把联合工厂的建筑物和居住的街区分隔开来。城市迤东近郊是斯大林格勒海，这个海是由于建筑斯大林格勒发电站而产生的。
    联合纺织工厂的建筑者们在各处工地同时施工。迅速成长的不仅是这个工人城市，在距城市较远的地方，也正在建筑着混凝土、木材加工等各种工厂。巨大的生产基地已经建筑起来了。目前这里正在建筑着第一个拥有数万纱锭的纺织工厂。
    在这工厂的建设工地上，我结识了混凝土工人的工作队长尼古拉·巴哈列夫，该工作队以斯大哈诺夫式的劳动著名。两年以前，尼古拉·巴哈列夫来到这里，他还没有任何特殊技能，他只希望能成为一个普通的泥水匠，他的这个理想很快地实现了。在建筑工地上成立了培养熟练工人的各种训练班。尼古拉·巴哈列夫在训练班里学习完泥水匠的课程后，曾担任建筑住宅的工作，并利用晚上的业余时间研究混凝土工人的作业，这样他很快就成了工作队长。
    巴哈列夫对我说：“在我的工作队中，有很多从伏罗聂日来的少女。她们原来都没有任何特殊的技能，但现在却已成为很好的混凝土工人了。我们已经完成了工作计划的百分之一百五十以上。为了使国家能够更快地得到我们联合工厂的产品，我们要更加努力工作。每天下班后，我们就举行简短的生产会议，讨论工作总结，揭发缺点，相互交流经验。这些对我们都是很有帮助的。”
    在工厂的建筑工地上，拉伊斯·卡西雅诺娃工作队的青年混凝土女工们工作得也很出色。她们也是从很远的地方来到这里的。经过了很短时间的工作以后，她们就掌握了建筑技术，并且对自己所从事的工作具有真正的热情。卡西雅诺娃说：“我们决定无论如何不离开这里。我们要建成联合工厂，而且我们还要留在车间里，将来作织布女工。”
    建筑联合工厂的主要是青年工人们。男女青年们操纵着掘土机、铲土机与起重机。他们还浇灌混凝土、建造楼房的墙壁。我同很多青年工人们谈过话，他们都热爱自己的建筑工程，而且打算把自己永远和联合纺织工厂联系起来，希望能成为纺织工人。当然，他们的理想是会实现的。
    在一个建筑工地上，我遇见了这个正在建筑中的联合工厂的厂长阿列克塞·苏什金工程师。他是个身材不高、五十来岁的人。他充满着工作的活力，而且动作是很敏捷的。他自豪而激动地对我们介绍了正在诞生着的这个巨大的纺织工厂：“我们的联合纺织工厂将是世界上最大的纺织工厂。它有四个纺纱厂，四个织布厂，两个加工工厂。联合工厂的生产力量，一昼夜就能生产一百万码的各种布匹。换句话说，一昼夜就能生产可以用来缝制十五万套衣服的纺织品。这个联合工厂将来每年所出产的产品，可以绕地球赤道七周半。
    这些产品不必运到远方，在苏联的东南部地区就能找到销路。因为消费者邻近我们，我们研究了他们的需要和兴趣，确定生产和加工什么样的布匹。现在人民生活得更富裕，那些朴素的布匹销路很少。人们要求质量更好的美观的纺织品。因此我们将生产绸缎、亚麻布、假缎子、特种面纱、法兰绒、天鹅绒和绵质丝绒。当然，在棉织品的花样和色泽方面也要尽量适合消费者的兴趣。”
    这位厂长告诉我说：“联合纺织工厂所需要的大量棉花纤维，开始时将首先从中亚细亚得到，以后逐渐以当地的原棉来代替。在斯大林格勒水电站建成以后，裹海沿岸地区的半沙漠地带将可得到灌溉，因此将来就可以在它邻近地区种植棉花。这样，联合工厂就会处于既接近原料产地，又不必销往远方，而且就近可以取得廉价的电力供应。
    苏联的各个机器制造工厂已为卡米新联合纺织工厂制造了各种机器装备，将来在全厂将采用纺织工业中从未用过的最新式的机器。由于纺织生产的特性，需要车间内部和工厂各部之间的各种运输设备，因此我们将大规模地采用气体运输、传送带和转运机等装置。将来工厂的各种自动化机械将操纵复杂的技术程序。在宽敞而明亮的车间里，人们管理着机器，这些机器已把工人们从沉重的体力劳动中解放出来了。”
    因为这个企业将充分地使用新式机器，所以将来需要一千名左右的工程师和技术人员。联合工厂的管理处已决定将来把在工厂里工作的五百个卡米新的男女青年派往各种技术学校去学习。为了培养熟练的纺织工人，最近将在卡米新开办纺织技术专门学校和工厂艺徒学校……。
    夜晚，当我离开这里时，整个建筑工地已是一片灯火辉煌了。巨大的红星——联合工厂建筑者们今天完成了计划的标志——闪耀在年轻的纺织工人城市的上空。我知道：在明天，在今后的日子里，红星还将照耀着。卡米新联合纺织工厂的建筑者们为了使这个巨大的纺织厂在今年秋季就得以开工，正在忘我地献出他们的一切力量。
