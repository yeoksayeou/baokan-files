    Commentary on Indian Prime Minister Nehru's Statement on the Indochina Issue
    Xinhua News Agency Commentator Jiang Nan
    Prime Minister Nehru's statement on the 24th has undoubtedly attracted the attention of world public opinion. The noteworthy aspect of Nehru's statement lies, first, in his articulation of the just nature of the independence war waged by the people of Indochina. Nehru said: "The conflict in Indochina, in its origin and basic nature, is an anti-colonialist resistance movement, and attempts to deal with this resistance by traditional methods of suppression and divide and rule." The history of the Indochina War clearly tells people that justice is on the side of the people of Indochina, represented by President Ho Chi Minh. Historically, there was the American War of Independence in 1776, and justice was on the side of the American people at that time; there was the French bourgeois revolution in 1789, and justice was on the side of the French people at that time. The war against colonialism waged by the people of Indochina has the same justice as these two wars that occurred in the eighteenth century. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries, sympathize with the people of Indochina. Another noteworthy point in Prime Minister Nehru's statement is his expression of legitimate concerns about American interference and expansion of the Indochina War, as well as aggression in Southeast Asia. Nehru said: "While the decision of the Geneva Conference is a welcome development, developments that cause our concerns and ominous premonitions soon followed. These include: 1. Repeated references to immediate and large-scale retaliation, references to possible attacks on the Chinese mainland, and talk of expanding and intensifying the war in Indochina; 2. Inviting Western countries, ANZUS Pact countries, and certain Asian countries to participate in joint and collective action in Southeast Asia. Prior to this, some remarks had been made that approached assuming protection over Southeast Asian countries or unilaterally declaring a Monroe Doctrine over Southeast Asian countries." The so-called "Monroe Doctrine over Southeast Asian countries" is to turn the entire Southeast Asia into an American colony, which is precisely the hidden purpose that the United States wants to achieve under the slogan of "joint action." Prime Minister Nehru's pointing it out demonstrates political insight.
    Restoring peace in Indochina is the unanimous hope of the people of all countries, including the people of Indochina and the people of France. One of the important tasks of the Geneva Conference is to solve this problem. Now the Indian government, through Prime Minister Nehru, advocates "putting forward the best thinking and effort to prevent this conflict from tending to expand and intensify, and to promote its tendency to lead to a solution," which is welcome. The People's Republic of China dispatched a delegation headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to participate in the Geneva Conference with sincerity. We believe that the common desire and common efforts of the representatives of all countries participating in the Geneva Conference to consolidate peace will provide the possibility of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and restoring peace in Indochina. However, we cannot fail to see that the American representative Dulles, before sitting down to meet, was still shouting about "Communist aggression in Asia." Does he sincerely hope to reach an agreement at the meeting? Now is the time to use consultation to solve problems, not to expand the Indochina War and invade Southeast Asian countries with any "joint action." Isn't that very clear? Consultation is a method for countries with different viewpoints to avoid war and solve problems; it is by no means for a single party or an organization controlled by a single party to act arbitrarily. As for the solution, we believe that as long as there is sincerity, as long as there is consultation, it will be obtained.

    评印度总理尼赫鲁关于印度支那问题的声明
    新华社评论员  江南
    尼赫鲁总理在二十四日发表的声明，毫无疑义是受到世界各国舆论的注意的。尼赫鲁声明中令人注意之处，首先在于他说出了印度支那人民所进行的独立战争的正义性。尼赫鲁说：“印度支那冲突就其起源和基本性质来说，乃是反殖民主义的反抗运动，以及用传统的镇压及分而治之的方法对付这一反抗的企图。”印度支那战争的历史清楚地告诉人们，正义是在以胡志明主席为代表的印度支那人民的方面。历史上曾经发生过一七七六年的美国独立战争，当时，正义是在美国人民方面；曾经发生过一七八九年的法国资产阶级革命，当时，正义是在法国人民方面。印度支那人民所进行的反对殖民主义的战争，是与十八世纪发生的这两个战争有同样的正义性，因而，世界人民特别是亚洲各国人民的同情印度支那人民，是完全可以了解的。尼赫鲁总理声明中另一点令人注意之处，又在于他说出了对于美国干涉和扩大印度支那战争以及侵略东南亚的正当忧虑。尼赫鲁说：“关于日内瓦会议的决定虽是一个受到欢迎的发展，但是引起我们的忧虑和不祥的预感的发展，不久就接踵而至了。其中包括：一、反复地提及立刻的和大规模的报复，提及对中国大陆可能的进攻，以及关于扩大和加紧印度支那战争的言论；二、邀请西方国家、美澳新公约国家和某些亚洲国家参加在东南亚的联合的和集体的行动。在这以前即曾发表过若干言论，这些言论接近于承担对东南亚各国的保护或片面地宣布一种对东南亚各国的门罗主义。”所谓“对东南亚各国的门罗主义”，就是把整个东南亚变为美国的殖民地，这正是美国在“联合行动”的口号下所要达到的不可告人的目的。尼赫鲁总理把它指出来，是有政治眼光的。
    恢复印度支那和平，这是世界各国人民，包括印度支那人民和法国人民在内所一致希望的。日内瓦会议的重要任务之一，正是解决这个问题。现在印度政府经过尼赫鲁总理，主张“拿出最好的思考和努力，以防止这一冲突趋于扩大与加剧而促使其趋于导致解决”，是值得欢迎的。中华人民共和国派遣以周恩来外长为首的代表团参加日内瓦会议，是抱着诚意的。我们相信，参加日内瓦会议的各国代表对巩固和平的共同愿望和共同努力，将会提供和平解决朝鲜问题与恢复印度支那和平的可能。可是，我们不能不看到，美国代表杜勒斯在坐下来开会以前，还在叫喊什么“共产党在亚洲的侵略”，难道他是真心希望在会议上达成协议的么？现在是要用协商的办法来解决问题，而不是用什么“联合行动”来扩大印度支那战争和侵略东南亚各国，难道不是很明白的么？协商是观点不同的国家之间避免战争而解决问题的方法，决不是由单独一方或被单独一方所把持的某种组织来独断独行。至于解决的方案，我们相信，只要有诚意，只要协商，是会得到的。
