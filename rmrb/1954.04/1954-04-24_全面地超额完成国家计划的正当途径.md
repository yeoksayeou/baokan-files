The Correct Path to Comprehensively Overfulfilling the National Plan
Shi Heng

In the first quarter of this year, many enterprises completed the national plan ahead of schedule, reporting their production achievements, which exceeded those of the fourth quarter of last year, to the state and Chairman Mao. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant is one of them. Their output in the first quarter exceeded the national plan by 10.2 percent, an increase of 4.5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year; quality exceeded the national plan by 0.52 percent, an improvement of 0.98 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year; and costs were reduced by more than 6 billion yuan compared to the national plan.

Why was the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant able to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan for the first quarter? First and foremost, it was due to the selfless labor and high socialist consciousness of the plant's employees. This enabled them to persistently struggle every day and every hour with great tenacity to save every minute of time and every one or two shovels of ore. It enabled them to struggle with a persistent spirit of learning to master increasingly complex new technologies. It enabled them, with a spirit of collectivist heroism, to set aside personal interests and strive for a common high level of output. These facts tell us that any enterprise that wants to complete the national plan with excellent results must fully trust the boundless power inherent in the masses, and must be good at mobilizing and guiding this power, entrusting the realization and overfulfillment of the national plan to them.

Of course, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees cannot be formed spontaneously. This requires the strong and in-depth leadership of the Party. The Party organization of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant made great efforts in this regard during the first quarter of this year. The most important thing was to transform general calls and general mobilization arrangements into practical and concrete education and organizational work; to transform the work of a few full-time Party and mass cadres into the work of all Party members and all the masses. They no longer just issued empty calls for the masses to "prevent and overcome complacency," but truly grasped the ideological activities and changes of the masses, launched mass criticism and self-criticism, and the masses themselves rose up to educate themselves. They no longer generally shouted "give play to the Party's supervisory and guaranteeing role," but specifically assigned tasks to each Party member, and used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to supervise each Party member to complete their tasks, truly ensuring that wherever there were difficulties, there were Communist Party members playing a role, and that the Party had strong supervision and guarantees at every important juncture in the completion of the national plan. The experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant tells us that to advance the Party's work in enterprises at present, the key lies in the specificity of leadership, in the depth of the integration of the Party's ideological and political work with the enterprise's economic activities, and in whether all Party members, rather than just a few Party cadres, can be organized to regularly carry out Party work.

Organizing industrial production is a scientific task. Whether it is increasing output, improving quality, or reducing costs, it is impossible to achieve without in-depth and meticulous daily organizational work. The excellent results achieved by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant are inseparable from the improvement of the plant's enterprise management level. Their output exceeded the national plan by 10.2 percent. This figure was accumulated bit by bit from the extraction and exploitation of favorable factors in the compilation and execution of the operation plan for each day, each shift, and each furnace, and by solving all kinds of specific problems through the operation meetings held every week and every day, and the shift handover meetings. Their costs were reduced by more than 6 billion yuan compared to the national requirements. This figure was obtained through the quota control of each furnace and each raw material, as well as economic analysis based on practical results, and the continuous discovery and expansion of advanced factors. Their quality exceeded the national plan by 0.52 percent, which was also inseparable from adhering to weekly technical seminars, constantly improving the technical level of workers, adhering to quality meetings every half month, strictly supervising the implementation of operating procedures, and taking concrete measures to improve quality. The experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant tells us that the more in-depth and meticulous the enterprise management, the more potential will be discovered, and the fewer restrictions will be placed on exploiting potential. And as long as an enterprise insists on continuously improving its management level, production will continue to grow, and this progress is the most solid and reliable.

However, improving management level can only discover and exploit favorable factors, reduce and eliminate unfavorable factors that artificially hinder production. To continuously improve production itself, this requires technology, the need to learn and promote advanced experiences, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. One of the most important reasons for the increase in production and the improvement of quality at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant is that they promoted advanced experience and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in the main and weak links of production. They did not regard this work as an extra task, but as a regular means to complete and overfulfill the national plan. Only when the promotion of advanced experience is integrated with the completion of the national plan in thought and work can the shortcomings of formalism, intermittent and irregular implementation, and the lack of specific organizational work in general calls be avoided.

Finally, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant pays great attention to the wage and bonus system, and pays attention to the combination of national interests and individual interests. In addition to the universal implementation of piece-rate wages, they advocated rapid steelmaking in production, and they implemented a reward system for rapid steelmaking. They needed to promote the experience of rapid turnover of ingot molds, so they implemented a reward system for rapid turnover of ingot molds. This is completely necessary and correct for bringing into play the enthusiasm of employees to promote production.

In summary, we can see that there is nothing mysterious or ingenious about the fact that the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant was able to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan. They simply followed the Party's already instructed and well-known principles: relying on the masses, giving play to the Party's supervisory and guaranteeing role, improving the enterprise management level, promoting advanced experience... taking step by step and doing solid work; they just persisted in unremittingly striving to improve the quality of various tasks in the enterprise on the original basis. There are no traces of crash programs here, no disrupting the next step of work while only caring about the present, and not a single achievement is obtained from speculation, relying on some unstable and temporary favorable factors. The path they are taking is a correct one. Only by following such a path can the continuous improvement of production be built on the most reliable foundation.

Of course, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant is not the only such enterprise. We have many enterprises that are the same as it, or even better than it. If all our enterprises can learn from these advanced enterprises, and these advanced enterprises can continue to strive for greater achievements without pride or complacency, then our process of building socialism will be greatly shortened, and the country's Five-Year Plan may be completed ahead of schedule.

    全面地超额完成国家计划的正当途径
    时恒
    今年第一季度，许多企业都提前完成了国家计划，以高于去年第四季度的生产成绩向国家和毛主席报捷。鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂就是其中的一个，他们第一季度的产量超过了国家计划百分之十点二，比去年第四季度增加了百分之四点五；质量超过了国家计划百分之零点五二，比去年第四季度提高了百分之零点九八；成本比国家计划降低了六十多亿元。
    鞍钢炼钢厂为什么能够全面地超额地完成第一季度的国家计划呢？首先，就是由于炼钢厂职工发挥了忘我劳动和高度的社会主义自觉的精神，因此他们就能以高度的坚韧性每日每时坚持不懈地为争取几分钟的时间和节省一两锹的矿石而斗争，就能以顽强的学习精神为掌握日益复杂的新技术而斗争，就能以集体主义的英雄气概，抛开个人的利益，为获得共同的高额产量而斗争。这些事实告诉我们，任何一个企业要想以优良的成绩完成国家计划，就必须充分相信群众中蕴藏着的这种无限巨大的力量，就必须善于发动和引导这个力量，把国家计划的实现和超额完成寄托在他们身上。
    当然，全体职工群众的积极性，是不可能自发地形成的。这里需要党的坚强的深入的领导。鞍钢炼钢厂的党组织今年第一季度中在这方面作了很大的努力，最主要的是把一般的号召、一般的动员布置变成了切实的具体的教育和组织工作；把少数专职的党群干部的工作变成了全体党员和全体群众的工作。他们不再是空洞地号召群众“防止和克服松劲情绪”，而是真正掌握了群众的思想活动和变化，展开群众性的批评和自我批评发动，群众自己起来教育了自己；他们不再是一般地喊“发挥党的监督保证作用”，而是给每个党员具体地分配任务，并且使用批评和自我批评的武器监督每个党员去完成自己的任务，真正做到了凡是有困难的地方就有共产党员在起作用，在完成国家计划的每一个重要关节上都有着党的强有力的监督和保证。鞍钢炼钢厂的经验告诉我们，要把目前企业中党的工作推进一步，关键就在于领导的具体性，在于党的思想政治工作和企业的经济活动结合的深度，在于能否把全体党员而不是少数党的干部组织起来去经常进行党的工作。
    组织工业生产是一个科学的工作。无论产量的增加、质量的提高、成本的降低，离开深入的细致的日常组织工作都是不可能实现的。鞍钢炼钢厂所以取得了优良的成绩，是和炼钢厂企业管理水平的提高分不开的。他们的产量超过了国家计划百分之十点二，这个数字是从编制和执行每一天每一班每一炉的作业计划中挖掘和发挥有利因素，是通过每一周每一天的作业会议和每一班的交接班会议解决各种各样的具体问题，而一点一点地积累起来的。他们的成本比国家要求降低了六十多亿元，这个数字是通过对每一炉每一种原材料的定额控制，以及根据实践结果进行经济分析，不断发掘和扩大其中的先进因素而得到的。他们的质量超过了国家计划百分之零点五二，也是和坚持每周一次的技术座谈会，不断提高工人的技术水平，坚持每半月一次的质量会议，严格监督操作规程的贯彻和在改善质量方面采取具体措施分不开的。鞍钢炼钢厂的经验告诉我们，企业的管理越深入越细致，潜力也就会发现得越多，发挥潜力所受到的限制也越少。而一个企业只要坚持不断地提高自己的管理水平，生产就会得到不断的增长，而这种进步乃是最巩固、最可靠的。
    但是，管理水平的提高只能发现和发挥有利的因素，减少和消灭人为的阻碍生产的不利因素，要使生产本身得到不断改善，这就需要技术，需要学习和推广先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验。鞍钢炼钢厂生产的提高和质量的改善，极其重要的原因之一就是在生产的主要环节和薄弱环节上推广了先进经验，贯彻了苏联专家的建议。他们不是把这项工作当做一件额外的事情，而是把它当作完成和超额完成国家计划的经常手段。只有在思想上和工作中把推广先进经验和完成国家计划融为一体的时候，推广先进经验中的形式主义、时断时续不能经常、只是一般号召缺乏具体的组织工作等等缺点也才能避免。
    最后，鞍钢炼钢厂十分注意工资奖励制度，注意国家利益和个人利益的结合。除了普遍实行计件工资之外，生产上要提倡快速炼钢，他们就实行了对快速炼钢的奖励制度；需要推广地坑快速周转的经验，他们就实行了地坑快速周转的奖励制度。这对发挥职工的积极性以推进生产，是完全必要的和正确的。
    综上所述，我们可以看出，鞍钢炼钢厂所以能全面地超额地完成了国家计划，并没有什么神秘和玄妙之处，他们只是按照党早已指示过并为大家所熟知的：依靠群众、发挥党的监督保证作用、提高企业管理水平、推广先进经验……一步一步踏踏实实地向前做去；他们只是坚持不懈地努力在原有基础上提高企业中各种工作的质量。这里没有突击的痕迹，没有只顾眼前而打乱下一步的工作，没有一点成绩是从投机取巧、依靠什么不稳定的暂时的有利因素而取得的。他们所走的路是一条正当的路。只有遵循着这样的途径，才可以把生产的持续不断的提高，建筑在最可靠的基础上。
    像鞍钢炼钢厂这样的企业当然不止一个，我们还有很多和它同样的甚至比它还要优秀的企业。如果我们所有的企业都能向这些先进的企业看齐，而这些先进的企业又能不骄傲不自满地继续争取更大的成就，那么，我们建设社会主义的进程就将大大缩短，国家的五年计划就有可能提前完成。
