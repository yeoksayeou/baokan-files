In social history, as in the history of science, there is an important law. Every new system of political life and every new scientific system that scientifically explains the universe, as long as it is truly advanced, will not only successfully solve newly emerging problems, but also solve problems raised at various stages of social or scientific development. Problems that seemed unsolvable to our political and scientific predecessors are often successfully solved by our generation. Of course, our generation has not solved all the problems. Future developments will supplement the endeavors of our generation, present new tasks to society, broaden people's horizons, and ultimately solve the problems that their predecessors faced but did not solve. Every truly progressive system of ideas and institutions has this characteristic: it can solve and more perfectly and accurately explain problems in political life or science that could not be solved before. Problems that Ptolemy could not solve were clarified by Copernicus and Galileo, and what they failed to do was completed by nineteenth-century scholars who created new theories of cosmic development; what nineteenth-century scientists failed to do is being completed by modern science.

We see the same process in the history of political development.

For example, the modern form of democracy established in Britain or France was undoubtedly a significant achievement for the people at the time, a progressive accomplishment. After centuries during which the broad masses of the people were completely unable to participate in political life, the emergence of bourgeois parliamentary democracy was indeed a step forward in the history of political life.

Marxist-Leninists have never denied this significance of bourgeois democracy. For example, Lenin repeatedly pointed out that a bourgeois democratic republic and universal suffrage were a great step forward compared to serfdom, because they made it possible for the working class to achieve such unity and solidarity as they have now.

However, under the capitalist system, many problems that progressive humanity yearned to solve, including some of the most important political problems with truly world-historical significance, remained unresolved.

These most important problems are, first of all: the problem of liberating workers from all exploitation and oppression, the problem of truly, rather than formally, enabling all the people to participate in the management of the state, the problem of relations between nationalities, the problem of the political, spiritual, and ideological unity of society, and the problem of widely disseminating culture, science, and civilization among all the people.

The development of political life in European countries has proceeded in such a way that, as social life transitioned from one form to a higher form, a wider range of masses participated in political life. There is no doubt that after the bourgeois revolutions in Britain, France, and Germany, the political rights of the people were expanded compared to before the revolutions. But what the people yearned for and strived for was very different from what they received. The bourgeois state and bourgeois parliamentary democracy, in their essence and their historical mission, are unable to attract the people to actively and voluntarily participate in the political life of society and the management of the state. Bourgeois democracy has never solved, and cannot solve, this problem.

Modern bourgeois parliamentary democracy finds it even more difficult to achieve some kind of spiritual or political unity among all citizens of society. The reason is obvious: a bourgeois democratic state is one in which there are both exploiting classes and various social groups who control most of the national wealth, and also classes and groups who have only a pair of working hands, knowledge, or meager property. For example, in the United States, everyone knows that more than 50 percent of the national wealth belongs to huge financial oligarchies that account for only about 2-3 percent of the total population. There are fifty million families in the United States, the vast majority of whom are starving and living beyond their means. Obviously, financial giants and working people will never have the same political tasks. Not to mention the irreconcilable contradictions in the interests of people, which stem from life itself and manifest themselves in the political sphere, and are equally evident in the moral and ideological spheres of all these classes and social groups.

Modern bourgeois society has not solved, and cannot solve, the major problem of raising the culture of the entire social mass and introducing the profound principles of science and civilization to all the people. Undoubtedly, the emergence of bourgeois society, the development of capitalist economy and political life in bourgeois states, was a huge impetus to the dissemination of culture, knowledge, and educational principles. But the dissemination of these cultural and civilizational principles only reached the level necessary for bourgeois society to manage the economy and produce commodities.

Bourgeois democracy has never taken any measures to prevent the knowledge accumulated over thousands of years of development from being monopolized and used against the interests of the people. On the contrary, the bourgeois state uses science and technology to oppose the people: to carry out arms races, pursue aggressive policies, oppress the people of other countries, and practice atomic blackmail and power politics.

However, the problems that bourgeois society and bourgeois democracy are unable to solve have been successfully solved by Soviet democracy. This proves that Soviet democracy is a new, higher, more developed and perfect form of political life than bourgeois parliamentarism.

Socialist society effectively solves the problem of truly involving all working people, all citizens of society, in the conscious and active construction of social life, and the problem of the people participating in the management of the state in accordance with the interests of the people.

Almost since the occurrence of property inequality, there have been reactionary views in the world discussing that people have various different missions in society. Aristotle in his "Politics" may have been the most frank and dogmatic in stating this idea. He convinced his disciples that it seemed most suitable for slaves to be slaves, and it was most suitable for slave owners to be slave owners. Since then, almost every generation has had new spokespersons who promoted social inequality among people. Currently, abroad, among the dominant propertied classes, there is a consensus that people from the people cannot manage the country. Here, by the way, the great significance of Soviet democracy lies in its overthrow and crushing of these views. In the Soviet Union, people from the people, workers, working farmers, and intellectuals create new material and spiritual wealth, and it is they who lead this work and manage the country. It can be seen that the Soviet system is the most democratic system for workers, peasants, and intellectuals, that is, for the people.

Under the conditions of bourgeois parliamentary democracy, the majority of adults in the country, that is, the people, have never been able to play much of an important role in the management of the country and the formulation of government policies, and of course, they cannot play a decisive or fundamental role. In bourgeois countries, only the ruling propertied classes can play this role.

The great change in modern political development, the remarkable new experience in national construction, is that for the first time in all political history since the emergence of the state, a society, Soviet society, has been established. As Lenin clearly pointed out, in this society all citizens are attracted to participate, regularly, indispensably, and decisively, in the democratic management of the state.

The reason why this is possible is that the Soviet Union is a socialist state of workers and peasants. Its political foundation is the Soviet of Workers' Representatives, and its economic foundation is the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production and production materials.

Therefore, the entire development of the Soviet state naturally and completely conforms to the interests of the people. It is enough to cite one example to illustrate this: from 1947 to 1952, the Soviet government lowered prices: bread by 61 percent, meat by 58 percent, butter by 63 percent, and sugar by 51 percent. During the same period, the increase in such prices in the United States was: 28 percent, 26 percent, 4 percent and 6 percent; in the United Kingdom: 90 percent, 35 percent, 125 percent and 133 percent; in France: 108 percent, 88 percent, 92 percent and 276 percent. This fact alone shows the decisive superiority of Soviet democracy.

The role of the basic socialist law in continuously improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people is clearly manifested here.

The various measures taken by the Soviet government and the Communist Party in recent times to further improve agriculture and expand the production of industrial products and food more clearly demonstrate the greatness of Soviet democracy.

Soviet democracy has also solved the problem of relations between nationalities. It has, in practice and in law, eliminated inequality between nationalities, and legally affirmed that all nationalities in the country enjoy equal political rights.

The greatness of Soviet democracy lies in the fact that it has mobilized a large amount of material and cultural resources and forces to rapidly and comprehensively improve all backward nationalities and peoples, enabling them to stand in the same ranks as more advanced nationalities and peoples, and exercise their rights to build a new life.

During the Great Patriotic War, the friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union was further tempered and consolidated. At the same time, Soviet democracy also drew new strength from this historical test.

The Soviet state's solution to the national question is one of mankind's greatest social achievements, and in terms of its historical significance, it is the only example of the rapid development of the culture and state of large and small nationalities.

One of the great achievements of Soviet democracy, which has a truly progressive nature, is that this system brilliantly solved the problem of establishing a socialist society that is united in spirit and politics.

The political solidarity of Soviet society is due to the alliance of workers and peasants, which is supported by the united forces of the working class and the peasantry with the Soviet intelligentsia, and it is the backbone of this society. In Soviet society, economic, political, or cultural interests do not conflict, and there are no different social tasks between workers, peasants, and intellectuals. On the contrary, workers, peasants, and intellectuals cooperate closely to build a communist society.

There is no need to elaborate here on the historical path that the Soviet state has gone through before Soviet society was able to achieve political and spiritual unity.

Let us only mention that this unity did not appear in ready-made form immediately after the October Socialist Revolution in 1917. In order to eliminate classes, especially the classes that oppress the people, in order to eradicate the various conditions that give rise to the exploiting classes and make it possible to seize the labor of others, it is necessary for all the people to carry out huge struggles and creative work under the leadership of the Communist Party; it is necessary to overcome the multiple structures of the Soviet economy, unite and build the entire economic life of the country on a unified socialist basis. This is a complex creative process of building a socialist society. Only when the new social system and the new social outline have clearly emerged, only when it is possible to talk about socialism based on the practice, life, and habits of our 200 million people, then did the political and spiritual unity of Soviet society emerge. The establishment of the political and spiritual unity of Soviet society is the greatest achievement of socialist democracy.

This unity is further consolidated by the profound patriotic enthusiasm generated by the elimination of the foundation, phenomena, and consequences of human exploitation, and the loyalty of the people of the new society to their system. Soviet society had already reached such a level of development in the years before World War II, when our country had entered the socialist period and was gradually transitioning to a communist way of life. It was at that time that all Soviet people had achieved not only political but also spiritual unity. It was at that time that the ardent patriotic enthusiasm of the Soviet people became more intense and more widely developed, and the deep and most sincere brotherly friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union was more powerfully manifested. This noble quality, which is unique to people under the new social system, is generated by life and developed in the new system. This quality has been widely disseminated and has become the most profound and extremely important characteristic of Soviet society, Soviet democracy, and Soviet people.

The boundless loyalty of the people of socialist society to their motherland and people; the unconditional, conscious, and sincere obedience to the interests of all the people, the state, and the collective on the basis of the harmonious unity of personal and public interests; the great perseverance held to achieve the established goals; the ability to defend one's noble ideals and correctly understand and overcome difficulties in the struggle against difficulties - all these are the new moral foundations on which the Soviet social system relies. This is the quality of the Soviet people, which is unique to millions of Soviet citizens and sufficient to illustrate the moral face of Soviet society.

Soviet democracy is continuing to further consolidate the political and spiritual unity of Soviet society, and vigorously promote the political and ideological unity of the socialist era. The Soviet Union, with its socialist democratic system, has opened up the road to communism. Under the communist system, all essential differences between mental and physical labor will disappear, and all citizens of society will become highly cultured people with profound knowledge, who are not only mastering modern natural science, but also understanding the science of Marxist-Leninism on the laws of social development, and possessing high culture. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have put forward a task: to widely disseminate modern knowledge and modern culture among the people, in order to finally raise all Soviet people to the level of the most advanced.

The great superiority of Soviet democracy lies in the fact that it takes the struggle for peace and friendship among all nations as one of its main foundations. Soviet democracy is a truly people's democracy, and the people are eager for peace, strive for peace, and fight for peace. Soviet democracy is also the peace of all nations.

Which party, government, and country in history, which political life and democratic system, can put forward such a great historical task to mankind? There has never been such a party, such a government and country, and such a democratic form in human history. The Soviet socialist state, Soviet democracy, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party are the first such party, government, country, and democratic form to appear. Today we may restate Lenin's famous saying: "Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet power is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic." ("Selected Works of Lenin," two-volume collection, Chinese version, Volume II, page 443)

There is no doubt that Soviet democracy is the most advanced political system in the life of the country, a system that is able to solve major social problems, including all those that cannot be solved in other national organizations and various bourgeois democracies.

This is where the historical significance and great power of Soviet democracy lie. The future inevitably belongs to socialist democracy, and can only belong to it. The political and economic development of the European people's democratic countries and the great China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea brilliantly prove this point. Soviet democracy is a guiding light for the working people of these countries to build a new life.

    苏维埃社会主义的民主是最高类型的民主
    苏联院士  格·亚历山大罗夫
    在社会史中，正像在科学史中一样，有一个重要的规律。每一种政治生活的新制度和科学地说明宇宙的科学新体系，只要它是真正先进的，就不仅会成功地解决新发生的问题，而且也能解决社会或科学的各个发展阶段上所提出的问题。我们的政治和科学界的前辈看来无法解决的问题，常常由我们这一代人成功地解决了。当然，我们这一代人也不是解决了所有的问题。未来的发展又会补充我们这一代人的事业，向社会提出新的任务，扩大人们的视野并最后地解决他们的前辈所面临过而未解决的问题。每种真正进步的观点和制度的体系，正是有着这种特点：它能解决和更完善更确切地说明政治生活或科学中前此所未能解决的问题。托勒密无法解决的问题由哥白尼和伽利略阐明了，他们未能做到的又由创立了宇宙发展新理论的十九世纪的学者们完成了，十九世纪科学家们所未能做到的，则由现代科学来完成。
    我们在政治发展史中也看到了同样的过程。
    例如在英国或法国确立过的那种现代的民主形式，无疑地在当时是人民的一项重大的成果，是他们的进步的成就。在多少世纪广大人民群众完全不能过问政治生活之后，资产阶级议会民主制的出现，在政治生活发展史上确是向前迈进了一步。
    马克思列宁主义者从来没有否认过资产阶级民主制的这种意义。例如，列宁曾屡次指出，资产阶级民主共和国和普选权比起农奴制来是一个巨大的进步，因为它们使工人阶级有可能达到像现在这样的联合和团结。
    但是在资本主义制度条件下，进步人类所渴望解决的许多问题，其中包括某些最重大的、有着真正世界历史意义的政治问题，却仍是悬而未决。
    这些最重大的问题首先就是：使劳动者摆脱一切剥削和压迫的问题，使全体人民真正地而不是形式地参加管理国家的问题，民族之间的关系问题，社会的政治、精神和思想的一致问题，在全体人民中广泛传播文化、科学和文明的问题。
    欧洲国家政治生活的发展是以这样的方式进行的：社会生活从一种形式过渡到另一种较高级的形式时，就有较广泛的群众参加政治生活。毫无疑问，在英国、法国和德国资产阶级革命之后，人民的政治权利比革命前扩大了。但是人民所渴望所力争的东西和他们所得到的却大大不同。资产阶级国家和资产阶级议会民主制，从它们的本质和它们的历史使命来说，是不能吸引人民积极地主动地参加社会的政治生活和国家管理的。资产阶级民主制从来不曾、而且也不可能解决这个问题。
    现代资产阶级议会民主制，企图使社会的全体公民在精神上或政治上达到某种一致，是更加困难的。原因很明显：资产阶级民主制国家是这样一种国家，那里既有掌握着大部分国民财富的剥削阶级和各种社会集团，也有只有一双劳动的手、知识或微薄的财产的阶级和集团。譬如在美国，大家知道，那里百分之五十以上的国民财富是属于约占全体居民百分之二——三的巨大的金融寡头的。美国有五千万个家庭，其中绝大部分都在挨饿和过着入不敷出的生活。显然，金融巨子们和劳动人民决不会抱着同样的政治任务的。更不必说，导源于生活本身并在政治领域中显现出来的人们利益的不可调和的矛盾了，这种矛盾在所有这些阶级和社会集团的道德和思想领域中也同样明显地表现了出来。
    现代资产阶级社会没有解决，而且也不可能解决提高整个社会群众文化，把科学和文明的高深原理介绍给全体人民的重大问题。不容置疑，资产阶级社会的产生，资产阶级国家中资本主义经济和政治生活的发展，曾是传播文化、学识和教育原理的一个巨大的推动力。但是这种文化和文明原理的传播仅仅达到了资产阶级社会为管理经济和生产商品所必要的水平。
    资产阶级民主制从未采取任何办法使人们在数千年发展中所积累起来的知识不致被垄断，不致用来反对人民的利益。恰恰相反，资产阶级国家正是利用科学和技术来反对人民：用来实行军备竞赛，推行侵略政策，压迫其它国家人民，实行原子恫吓和实力政策。
    然而资产阶级社会、资产阶级民主制所无力解决的问题，却为苏维埃民主制成功地解决了。这证明了苏维埃民主制是一种全新的、比资产阶级议会制更高级的、更为发展和完善的政治生活形式。
    社会主义社会依据人民利益有效地解决了使全体劳动人民、社会的全体公民真正参加自觉的和积极的建设社会生活的问题，解决了人民参加国家管理的问题。
    几乎是自从发生了财产不平等的时候起，世界上便出现了论述人们在社会中有着各种不同使命的反动观点。亚里士多德在其“政治学”一书中可能是最坦率、最武断地说出了这种观念。他使他的门徒相信：仿佛对奴隶来讲，做奴隶是最适宜的，而对奴隶主来讲，则做奴隶主是最适宜不过的。从那时起，几乎每一代都有宣扬人们的社会不平等的新的代言人。目前，在国外，在那些占统治地位的有产阶级中间流行着一种公论：来自人民的人不能管理国家。这里顺便谈一下，苏维埃民主的伟大意义就在于它推翻并粉碎了这些观点。在苏联，来自人民的人，工人、劳动农民、知识分子创造着新的物质的和精神的财富，也正是他们在领导着这项工作并管理着国家。由此可见，苏维埃制度对于工人、农民、知识分子，也就是说对于人民来说，是最民主的制度。
    在资产阶级议会民主制的条件下，国家的大多数成年人，即人民，对国家的管理和政府政策的制定，从来不能起多少重要的作用，当然更不能起决定性的、基本的作用。在资产阶级国家中，只有居于统治地位的有产阶级才能起这种作用。
    现代政治发展中的伟大变革，国家建设中的卓越的新的经验就是，自从国家产生以来，在全部政治史上第一次建立了这样的社会，苏维埃社会。正如列宁明确指出的，在这个社会中全体公民都被吸引来，经常地、不可缺少地，而且是决定性地参加对国家的民主管理。
    其所以能够这样，是因为苏联是工农社会主义国家。它的政治基础是劳动者代表苏维埃，它的经济基础是社会主义经济体系和生产工具及生产资料的社会主义所有制。
    因此，苏维埃国家的全部发展自然而然完全符合于人民的利益。只要举这样一个例子就足以说明了：从一九四七年到一九五二年，苏联政府降低了物价：面包降低百分之六十一，肉类——百分之五十八，牛油——百分之六十三，糖——百分之五十一。在这同一时期，这类物价的上涨情况在美国是：百分之二十八，百分之二十六，百分之四和百分之六；在英国是：百分之九十，百分之三十五，百分之一百二十五和百分之一百三十三；在法国是：百分之一百零八，百分之八十八，百分之九十二和百分之二百七十六。只从这一事实就可以看出苏维埃民主制的决定意义的优越性。
    社会主义基本法则不断提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平的作用，在这里明显地表现了出来。
    最近时期，苏联政府和共产党为进一步提高农业和扩大工业品和食品的生产所采取的各项措施，更加明显地表现出了苏维埃民主的伟大。
    苏维埃民主制也解决了民族间关系的问题。它在实际上，在立法上消灭了民族间的不平等，以立法手续确认国内所有各民族享有同等的政治权利。
    苏维埃民主的伟大在于，它动员了大量的物质的与文化的资源和力量来迅速地、全面地提高各落后民族和人民，使它们能同比较先进的民族和人民站在一个行列中，运用自己的权利来建设新生活。
    在伟大卫国战争中，苏联各族人民的友谊受到更大的锻炼而且更加巩固了。同时，苏维埃民主制也在这个历史性的考验中汲取了新的力量。
    苏维埃国家对于民族问题的解决，是人类最伟大的社会成果之一，就其历史意义说，是解决使大民族和小民族的文化和国家迅速发展的仅有范例。
    具有真正进步性质的苏维埃民主制的伟大成果之一是，这个制度辉煌地解决了建立在精神上和政治上团结一致的社会主义社会的问题。
    苏维埃社会在政治上的团结一致是由于有工农联盟，这个联盟是被工人阶级和农民阶级同苏维埃知识分子的联合力量所支持的，它是这个社会的骨干。在苏维埃社会中经济、政治或文化利益不相抵触，工人、农民和知识分子之间没有不同的社会任务。恰恰相反，工人、农民和知识分子密切合作以建设共产主义社会。
    在这里无需详述苏维埃社会能够达到政治上和精神上的一致以前，苏维埃国家所经历过的历史道路。
    这里只提一下，这种一致并不是在一九一七年十月社会主义革命以后马上就以现成的形式出现的。为了消灭阶级，首先是消灭压迫人民的阶级，为了铲除产生剥削阶级和使攫夺他人劳动成为可能的各种条件，就需要全体人民在共产党领导下进行巨大的斗争和创造性的工作；需要克服苏联经济的多种结构，在统一的社会主义基础上联合并建设国家的全部经济生活。这是建设社会主义社会的复杂的创造过程。只有新的社会制度、新的社会的轮廓已明显地出现，只有根据我国两亿人口的实践、生活和习惯已经可以谈到社会主义的时候，那时才产生了苏维埃社会的政治上和精神上的一致。苏维埃社会政治和精神的一致的建立，是社会主义民主最伟大的成果。
    由于人剥削人的基础、现象和后果的消灭而产生的深厚的爱国主义热情和新社会的人对自己制度的忠诚，使得这种一致更加巩固了。苏维埃社会在第二次世界大战前几年便已经达到了这样的发展水平，当时我国已进入社会主义时期并正在逐渐向共产主义生活方式过渡。就是在当时全体苏联人才不仅在政治上，而且在精神上已达到了一致。就是在当时，苏维埃人的炽烈的爱国主义热情更加强烈，更加广泛地展开了，苏联各族人民的深厚的和最真挚的兄弟友谊更有力地表现了出来。新社会制度下的人所特有的这种高贵的品质，是由生活中产生的并在新制度中得到了发展，这种品质已普遍地传播开来，并变成了苏维埃社会、苏维埃民主和苏维埃人的最深刻的极重要的特征。
    社会主义社会的人们对自己祖国和人民的无限忠诚；在个人利益和公共利益协调一致的基础上，无条件地、自觉地、真诚地服从全体人民、国家和集体的利益；为达到既定目标所持的伟大的坚忍不拔精神；在与困难作斗争时能捍卫自己的高尚理想并善于正确地理解和克服困难——所有这些都是苏维埃社会制度所依靠的新的道德基础。这就是千百万苏联公民所特有的、足以说明苏维埃社会道德面貌的苏联人的品质。
    苏维埃民主正在继续进一步巩固苏维埃社会政治上和精神上的一致，大力发扬社会主义时代政治和思想的一致。苏联以它的社会主义民主制度开辟了走向共产主义的道路，在共产主义制度下，脑力劳动和体力劳动的一切本质差别都将消失，社会上的全体公民都将成为有高深修养的、既掌握现代自然科学又通晓马克思列宁主义关于社会发展法则的科学的、具有高度文化的人。苏联共产党和苏维埃政府提出了一项任务：就是要在人民中广泛传播现代知识和现代文化，以便最后把全体苏联人民提高到最先进者的水平。
    苏维埃民主的伟大优越性在于它是以争取各族人民的和平与友谊的斗争作为自己的主要基础之一。苏维埃民主是真正人民的民主，而人民在渴望和平、争取和平，为和平而斗争。苏维埃民主也就是各族人民的和平。
    历史上有哪一个政党、政府和国家，有哪一种政治生活和民主制度，能向人类提出这样伟大的历史任务呢？在人类史上还不曾有过这样的政党、这样的政府和国家以及这样的民主形式。苏维埃社会主义国家、苏维埃民主、苏维埃政府和共产党就是第一次出现的这样的党、政府、国家和民主形式。今天我们不妨重述列宁的名言：“无产阶级的民主制比任何资产阶级民主制都要更民主一百万倍；苏维埃政权比最民主的资产阶级共和国都要更民主几百万倍。”（“列宁文选”两卷集，中文版，第二卷四四三页）
    毫无疑问，苏维埃民主制是国家生活中最先进的政治制度，这个制度能够解决重大的社会问题，其中包括所有在其他国家组织中和各种资产阶级民主制所无法解决的问题。
    苏维埃民主制的历史意义和伟大力量就在于此。未来必然属于社会主义民主制，而且也只能属于它。欧洲各人民民主国家以及伟大的中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的政治和经济的发展辉煌地证明了这点。苏维埃民主是这些国家劳动人民建设新生活的指路明灯。
