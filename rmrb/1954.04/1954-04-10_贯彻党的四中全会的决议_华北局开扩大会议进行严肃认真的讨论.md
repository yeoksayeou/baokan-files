Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its entire committee from March 16th to 21st to convey the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting was attended by all members of the North China Bureau, with the participation of the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party committees of Hebei and other provinces and cities, military-level cadres from the North China Military Region and its affiliated units, and senior cadres at or above the deputy ministerial level from North China's first-level organs, totaling sixty-one people.

The meeting listened to the report given by Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau, on the transmission of the resolutions, and engaged in serious and earnest discussions. Liu Xiufeng, Third Deputy Secretary of the North China Bureau, Yang Chengwu, Deputy Commander of the North China Military Region, and the secretaries of various provincial and municipal committees, along with other responsible cadres, spoke at the meeting. The comrades present unanimously and wholeheartedly supported the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the plenary session. The speeches unanimously held that the Central Committee's resolution on strengthening Party unity was completely correct, absolutely necessary, and extremely timely. It greatly enhanced the understanding of the importance of Party unity among senior cadres in the Party organizations and armed forces of the North China region, and raised their vigilance against various statements and actions that harm Party unity. It has become the regulation and standard for all words and deeds of senior cadres in the Party organizations and armed forces of the North China region. The meeting affirmed that the implementation of the plenary session's resolution would be a great victory of historical significance in the Party's ideological and organizational construction. It will certainly greatly enhance and consolidate Party unity, ensuring that our country is built into a great socialist country.

The meeting noted that in a period when class struggle is becoming increasingly tense and complex, imperialists and all counter-revolutionary elements will inevitably try every means to undermine Party unity. Therefore, the meeting particularly emphasized that strict vigilance and inspection must be exercised against any statements or actions that could be exploited by the enemy and are detrimental to Party unity. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out correctly, proceeding from unity, and be prevented and stopped in a timely manner. As for those who intentionally undermine Party unity and engage in sectarian activities within the Party, a merciless struggle must be waged against them, otherwise they will degenerate into despicable bourgeois individualistic careerists, and the bourgeoisie may find their agents within our Party. This poses a great threat to the Party's life—unity—and must be taken seriously.

The meeting was filled with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Self-criticism was carried out regarding the lack of strict implementation of the system of requesting instructions and reporting work, the existence of certain decentralist tendencies, the imperfect democratic life and collective leadership system, and the still relatively strong liberalistic habits, with the so-called phenomenon of "no communication between superiors and subordinates, and no confrontation in the middle" (meaning the inability to develop criticism). The meeting also deeply felt that its revolutionary sense of smell was not high, its revolutionary sensitivity and vigilance were insufficient, and its understanding of the importance of cherishing Party unity was inadequate. The participants also put forward many concrete suggestions for overcoming these shortcomings.

The meeting further pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, organize the entire Party to study, examine one's own work and words and deeds based on the resolutions, and on this basis, promote inner-Party democracy, further carry out criticism and self-criticism, oppose and overcome bourgeois individualistic thoughts and complacency within the Party, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, so as to improve revolutionary vigilance, strictly abide by the principles of collective leadership, and consolidate Party unity. Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted the corresponding resolutions.

    贯彻党的四中全会的决议
    华北局开扩大会议进行严肃认真的讨论
    【新华社八日讯】中共中央华北局在三月十六日到二十一日举行全体委员会扩大会议，传达中共七届四中全会的决议。出席会议的有华北局全体委员，列席的有中共内蒙古分局、中共河北等省、市委正副书记，华北军区和所属各部队军以上干部及华北一级机关副部长以上高级干部共六十一人。
    会议听了华北局第三书记刘澜涛的传达报告，并进行了严肃认真的讨论。会上发言的有华北局第三副书记刘秀峰、华北军区副司令员杨成武，各省、市委书记和其它负责干部多人。到会同志完全一致和衷心地拥护刘少奇同志代表中共中央政治局在七届四中全会上所作的报告和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”。发言中一致认为中共中央关于增强党的团结的决议是完全正确、绝对必要和十分及时的，它大大提高了华北区党的组织和武装部队中高级干部对党的团结的重要性的认识，对各种危害党的团结的言论行动的警惕，并成为华北区党的组织和武装部队中高级干部一切言行的法规和准则。会议肯定地认为，全会决议的贯彻将是党在思想建设、组织建设上具有历史意义的伟大胜利。一定会极大地增强和巩固党的团结，保证把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。
    会议鉴于阶级斗争日趋于紧张化、复杂化的时期，帝国主义和一切反革命分子必然会千方百计地破坏党的团结。因此会议特别强调指出：对于任何可以被敌人利用的不利于党团结的言行必须严加警惕，严格检查，并从团结出发，正确地开展批评和自我批评，加以及时的防止和制止。而对于那种有意破坏党的团结，在党内进行宗派活动的分子，就必须进行无情的斗争，否则他们就会堕落成为卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义野心家，资产阶级就有可能在我们党内找到他们的代理人。这是对党的生命——团结——的一种极大的威胁，必须引起严重警惕。
    会议充满了批评和自我批评的精神，对于在工作中执行请示报告制度不严格，还存在着某些分散主义；民主生活、集体领导制度不健全，自由主义习气还相当浓厚，有所谓“上下无往来，中间不交锋”（批评展不开的意思）的现象等都进行了自我批评。会议也深感革命嗅觉不高，革命的敏感和警惕不够，对珍视党的团结的重要性认识不足。与会者并提出了许多克服这些缺点的具体建议。
    会议进而指出：必须坚决贯彻七届四中全会的决议，组织全党学习，根据决议检查自己的工作和言行，并在此基础上发扬党内民主，进一步开展批评和自我批评，反对和克服党内资产阶级个人主义思想和骄傲自满情绪，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，以提高革命警惕性，严格遵守集体领导的原则，巩固党内团结。最后，会议一致通过了相应的决议。
