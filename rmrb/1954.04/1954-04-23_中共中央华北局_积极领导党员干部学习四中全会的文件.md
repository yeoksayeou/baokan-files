    The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau
    Actively Leads Party Members and Cadres in Studying the Documents of the Fourth Plenary Session
    [This Newspaper] The North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee is strengthening its leadership over the study of the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session. Following the enlarged meeting of the North China Bureau's entire committee, Liu Lantao, the Third Secretary of the North China Bureau, delivered a report on April 2nd and 3rd to more than 1,600 Party members and cadres from North China's level one organizations and groups equivalent to county committee members and above, conveying the resolutions and spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session. This gave everyone a clearer understanding of the essence of the Central Committee's report and resolutions, particularly regarding the importance of strengthening Party unity.
    In order to organize and lead Party members in the North China region to study the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, the North China Bureau established a Study Committee for the Documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, personally presided over by Zhang Panshi, the Fourth Deputy Secretary of the North China Bureau, and including responsible cadres from various departments. Larger units within the North China-level organizations have organized study branches; Party members and cadres who have already heard the reports have also been formed into fifty-five study groups, each led by the head of the department.
    The study time is set at one month to one and a half months. The study plan requires Party members and cadres of each organization and group to express their understanding based on the reports conveyed in the first stage; in the second stage, they will further discuss the reports conveyed in conjunction with reading the documents, in order to further improve their political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance; in the third stage, on the basis of enhancing understanding, they will link with their personal thoughts and work reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conscientiously check and correct various unhealthy phenomena that are not conducive to Party unity, so as to enhance Party spirit and ensure the unshakable unity of the Party's ranks, and ensure the socialist construction cause of our country. The plan stipulates that the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session shall be the main study documents, combined with the general line and "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" for study. The Study Committee also printed important documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao on strengthening Party unity for reference during the study.
    Currently, Party members and cadres in various units are conducting discussions intensively. Many leading cadres go deep into the groups to participate in the discussions. The Study Committee listens to reports and provides guidance in a timely manner.
