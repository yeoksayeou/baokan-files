After Receiving the Gold Star Medal
By Li Shunda, 1952 National Model Worker and Gold Star Medal Winner for Patriotic Production Increase

On February 13th, Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government personally hung the 1952 National Gold Star Medal for Patriotic Production Increase, awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, around my neck at a conference attended by over 1,200 farmer representatives from across the province. This medal brought me unparalleled honor and also encouraged and strengthened my courage and confidence in further improving the cooperative and increasing agricultural production.

When I returned to the county with the medal, the county-wide model worker conference was in session, and the 140 model worker representatives immediately surrounded me, cheering in unison: This is the glory of all our working people! They said: It is unprecedented for working people to wear a Gold Star Medal. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must strive for even greater harvests and support the country's industrialization. When I returned to the village, the cooperative members jumped for joy. Zhang Huize, an old man in his sixties, leaning on his crutch, touched the Gold Star Medal on my chest and said with a smile, "Chairman Mao cherishes the people. In his eyes, the working people are more precious than gold. He is truly the leader of the people!" The other cooperative members also expressed their determination to work harder to strive for even greater production increases.

Our agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry cooperative has expanded from 47 households last year to 199 households, accounting for 72 percent of the total number of households in the township. The cooperative members and I have already discussed that this year, we will make full use of the superior conditions of the large cooperative, strive to increase grain production by 150,000 jin and sell 70,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. In terms of agricultural production, we aim for an average yield of 346 jin of raw grain per mu, an increase of 17 percent compared to last year. In terms of forestry production, we aim to have each person plant and keep alive an average of 13 trees, totaling more than 11,600 trees, sow seeds for afforestation on 200 mu of barren mountains, close off 300 mu of mountains for forest cultivation, and cultivate 1.5 mu of nurseries. In terms of animal husbandry, in addition to raising the existing 570 sheep, we will breed another 300 lambs. The number of large livestock is required to increase from the existing 94 to 115. In order to support agricultural production and increase the income of cooperative members, we also plan to draw a small number of cooperative members to develop sideline production such as oil extraction, transportation, ironwork, and carpentry. After these plans are completed, each cooperative member household will increase their income by about 800 jin of grain compared to last year.

After the Gold Star Medal was awarded, the production enthusiasm of all our cooperative members was particularly high, and we basically completed the spring plowing preparations in early March. In the half-month from March 5th to 20th, 164 male and female laborers worked hard to repair and pad 21 mu of beach land, which can be planted with hemp this year. Planting trees began on March 25th, and in three days, 30,000 locust trees were planted, exceeding the annual plan by two times. Under the leadership of our cooperative, farmers throughout the township are throwing themselves into the spring plowing production competition with unparalleled labor enthusiasm. Everyone is confident that they can sow seeds in a timely manner and ensure full seedling emergence, laying a good foundation for this year's production increase.

    获得金星奖章以后
    一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章获得者　李顺达
    二月十三日，山西省人民政府裴丽生主席在全省一千二百多个农民代表参加的大会上，亲手把中央人民政府农业部颁发的一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章挂在我的胸前。这个奖章，带给了我无比的光荣，也鼓舞和坚定了我进一步办好合作社、提高农业生产的勇气和信心。
    当我带着奖章回到县里的时候，全县劳动模范大会正在举行，一百四十名劳动模范代表，一下就把我围成一团，大家异口同声地欢呼：这是我们全体劳动人民的光荣！他们说：劳动人民挂上金星奖章真是开天辟地以来没有的事情，咱们要在毛主席的领导下，争取更大的丰收，支援国家工业化建设。回到村里时，社员们高兴得跳起来了，六十多岁的张会则老汉，扶着拐杖，摸着我胸前的金星奖章，笑哈哈地说：“毛主席爱护人民，他眼中的劳动人民比黄金还重，真是人民的领袖呀！”其余社员也都表示要更加努力争取更大的丰产。
    我们的农林畜牧生产合作社，已由去年的四十七户扩大到一百九十九户，占全乡总户数百分之七十二。我和社员们已经讨论过，我们今年要大力发挥大社的优越条件，争取增产十五万斤粮食并卖余粮七万斤给国家。在农业生产方面，要求每亩平均产原粮三百四十六斤，比去年增产百分之十七。在林业生产方面，要求每人平均植活十三棵树，共植一万一千六百多株，荒山播种林木二百亩、封山育林三百亩、培养苗圃一亩半。在牧畜方面，除养好现有的五百七十只羊外，再繁殖小羊三百只。大牲畜要求由现有的九十四头增加到一百一十五头。为了支援农业生产和增加社员收入，还准备抽出小部分社员发展榨油、运输、铁工和木工等副业生产。这些计划完成后，全社今年每户社员将比去年增加约八百斤粮食的收入。
    在颁发金星奖章以后，我们全体社员生产热情格外高涨，三月上旬已基本上完成春耕准备工作。在三月五日到二十日半个月中，就有一百六十四个男女劳动力一股劲儿修垫滩地二十一亩，这些地今年就能种上大麻。三月二十五日开始植树，三天时间植洋槐树三万株，超过全年计划两倍。在我们社的带动下，全乡农民正以无比的劳动热情投入春耕生产竞赛运动。大家都有信心做到适时下种，保证全苗，给今年增产打下良好基础。
