In North China, Northeast China, Shanghai, and other places, short-term sports cadre training classes are being held successively to cultivate grassroots sports cadres in a planned way. The short-term sports cadre training class for workers in North China started in early April. More than 50 people, including cadres from trade unions at all levels in North China and sports activists from factories and mines, are participating in the training. The content of their study focuses on sports theory, exercise physiology, basic knowledge of sports hygiene, and working methods for carrying out mass sports activities in factories and mines. In addition, they will also study technical courses such as gymnastics, ball games, and folk sports. The study period is three months. Shanxi Province held a short-term sports cadre training class in January this year, training 43 sports cadres from industrial, coal mining, and other systems. During the training period, everyone also exchanged experiences in carrying out sports activities in factories and mines. A certain ball bearing factory in Liaodong Province, in order to carry out mass sports activities, also held an amateur sports activist training class. The workers from each workshop who participated in the study felt that this was of great help to carrying out gymnastics before and after work throughout the factory. The second phase of the Shanghai Sports Cadre Training Class started in early April. More than 120 trainees are participating in the study, including sports cadres and educated youth from factories, grassroots trade unions, workers' clubs in various districts, the armed forces, government agencies, and various stadiums and gymnasiums. After this study, they will create favorable conditions for further carrying out mass sports activities.
