    An internal materials exchange meeting was recently held in Hefei by supply and marketing cooperatives from sixty-five counties in Anhui Province to adjust surpluses and shortages, organize sources of goods, and vigorously supply farmers with materials for spring plowing. The total transaction volume at the meeting reached 35.4 billion yuan, including more than 420,000 pieces of large and small farm tools. Funan County had a large number of farm tools made of willow branches, and the Chuxian Special District purchased 43,500 pieces in one go. The ploughing machines and carts processed by handicraftsmen from the Linquan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative had originally become slow-selling goods. At the exchange meeting, they found a market for 460 ploughing machines and 500 carts. The 1,600 ox carts and hand-operated waterwheels needed by the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Huaibei area also found a source of supply at the Provincial Cooperative General Society's farm implement processing plant.
