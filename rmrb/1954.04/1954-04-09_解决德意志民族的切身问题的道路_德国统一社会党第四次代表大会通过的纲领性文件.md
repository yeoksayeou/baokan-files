Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 8th: The Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany adopted a programmatic document: "The Road to Solving the Vital Problems of the German Nation." This document sets forth the principles for the struggle of the German working class, working peasants, intellectuals, and all peace-loving Germans to solve the vital problems of the German nation.

The document states that the German people must make the most serious choice in their modern history. The German people cannot escape this choice. They must choose one of two: either submit to the United States and engage in war, or obtain German independence and peace.

Germany is divided into two opposing camps. One is the camp of peace forces, and the other is the camp of war.

The document then points out that Germany's peace-loving forces are striving to achieve a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany, to conclude a peace treaty with relevant countries; to demand that Germany be freed from foreign occupation; to advocate the rapid establishment of a provisional all-German government responsible for preparing and holding free and democratic elections; to hope that West Germany will be exempted from paying reparations and, before the occupation regime is abolished, that occupation costs be reduced to no more than five percent of the national budget; and to dedicate themselves to peaceful cooperation among all European countries and the unity of all European countries within a collective security system. On the other hand, the war forces in West Germany are trying their best to implement the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, which will lead to the long-term division of Germany and turn West Germany into a military base; to advocate that the occupation of West Germany by the United States, Britain, and France be maintained until the end of the 20th century; to hope that undemocratic elections will be held in Germany under the control of the occupying authorities, agreeing that West Germany should continue to pay reparations; to continue to extract more huge occupation costs from the residents of West Germany; they do not want to establish an all-European collective security system, but strive to establish a narrow group of six Western European countries under the guise of the "European Defense Community."

The document continues, the German people must choose one of these two paths, the path of peace and the path of war.

The Socialist Unity Party of Germany was born in a time of deep national disaster. Within its leading bodies and its ranks are strong fighters against militarism, fascism, and war. It fights side by side with all peace-loving people to build a new Germany. Now it declares: the Bonn and Paris Treaties hinder German unification and pave the way for war. For the happiness of the German people, no part of our homeland can join the military alliance of the United States and Britain. If Germany is to live in peace, then the Paris Treaty on the "European Defense Community" and the Bonn "General Treaty" must be abandoned, and the re-militarization of West Germany must be stopped. If Germany is to finally be unified, then the U.S. interference and domination of West Germany, which aims to maintain the division of Germany, must be ended, and the occupation statutes must be abolished. The National Front of Democratic Germany, uniting patriotic and democratic forces, has taken on its historical task in this struggle.

The Soviet Union has pointed out the path to a peaceful solution to the German question and has granted sovereignty to the German Democratic Republic. The independence and autonomy of the German Democratic Republic points out a path for all of Germany and inspires all patriotic forces in West Germany to strengthen their struggle against the Bonn and Paris Treaties. The restoration of German unity can only be achieved through the joint efforts of the German people themselves. The restoration of German unity can only be achieved through democratic means. Therefore, the greatest demand at present remains: Germans should come together! Only in this situation, that is, when Germans approach each other in a free consultation process, when workers in East and West Germany establish contact, and when peasants and intellectuals follow them, can we overcome the danger of war. All good Germans hope to end the artificial division of our nation. Therefore, patriotic people in West Germany must unite and fight resolutely so that the Bonn government can no longer ignore their demands. In this way, the door to consultation can be opened to discuss the vital national issues of the German people; a joint committee composed of representatives from West and East Germany can be established to establish economic and cultural ties; and an agreement can be reached on the establishment of a temporary all-German government.

Regarding the issue of all-German elections, the programmatic document points out that such elections should be held without foreign interference, without pressure from the occupying authorities, and without pressure from West German monopoly capitalists and militarists. In this regard, the document also points out that German patriots should fight with all their strength against militarist propaganda; strive for all-German negotiations to reach agreements on the following issues: determine the number of police in East and West Germany, expand trade between East and West Germany, establish freedom for the sale of humanitarian books, and prohibit the dissemination of books promoting militarist ideas; and strive to reach agreements on the issue of all-German representation and a treaty guaranteeing peace and security for Germany.

The programmatic document points out that the conclusion of an all-European collective security treaty can guarantee peace and security in Europe. The document says that no one has more at stake in an all-European collective security treaty than the German people, because the conclusion of this treaty will enable the two parts of Germany to come closer together and will guarantee Germany's overall neutrality. The document emphasizes that only the Soviet Union has put forward concrete proposals for restoring Germany's unity and independence on a democratic and peaceful basis; and the Western countries, especially the United States, have rejected this proposal. The Soviet Union has given generous assistance to the German Democratic Republic and has allowed this part of Germany to gain sovereignty. The Soviet Union has proposed to West Germany to establish economic and cultural relations and advocates allowing democratic Germany to participate in the United Nations as an equal member. We adhere to the principle of maintaining friendly relations with all countries and peoples, and we actually do so. Since the German Democratic Republic has special friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, it also hopes to develop friendly relations with all capitalist countries, including the United States.

The document then points out: now a truly democratic system has been established in the German Democratic Republic, while in West Germany, the ruling class is suppressing democracy and reviving militarism. The document says: suppressing democracy and reviving militarism are two sides of the same coin, and their goal is nothing more than to prepare for war... The question facing members of the German Social Democratic Party and members of West German trade unions is: do they want to fight to ensure peace? Or are they willing to become victims of the "European Defense Community" and the American war jointly prepared by West German and American militarists? The new situation after the Berlin Four-Power Conference makes it necessary for the German Social Democratic Party to truly change its course and aim at establishing the unity of action of the working class... All measures must be taken to unite the workers in the two parts of Germany, because the maintenance of peace and the future of Germany depend on the cooperation and unity of action of the German working class. Workers' groups—groups of all Social Democratic workers, Communist workers, trade union members, non-party workers, and Christian workers—must confront the militarist groups formed in West Germany under the leadership of the ruling parties in Bonn. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic propose holding all-German negotiations, suggesting that a joint committee composed of representatives from East and West Germany be established to reach an agreement on the issue of establishing a temporary all-German government, whose main task is to prepare for free and democratic all-German elections. These proposals, as well as the proposal on concluding an "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe," are acceptable to every member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and every member of the trade unions in West Germany. We extend a brotherly hand to all members of the Social Democratic Party, members of the trade unions, and members of Christian trade unions to fight together against our common enemy and German militarism.

In the section of the delegates assembly document titled "The German Democratic Republic—A Bastion for the Struggle to Build a New Germany," achievements in industry and agriculture are pointed out, as well as tasks in the economic aspect. It states that the working class, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in alliance with the working peasants, and in cooperation with the intellectuals, has achieved remarkable success in the cause of implementing the Five-Year Plan. In the German Democratic Republic, the foundations of socialism have begun to be established, and this historical task will be completed.

The document also states that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany strives to establish a democratic Germany. The German Democratic Republic defends the interests of the working people of West Germany and the interests of the entire German people, and therefore makes the following demands to West Germany: reduce occupation costs; stop paying reparations; develop domestic trade in Germany, and develop trade with the democratic camp to eliminate unemployment and underemployment; reduce the tax burden on the vast majority of residents, while increasing the profit tax on wealthy households; stop raising prices; give land to settlers and carry out democratic land reform; the 700,000 hectares of land confiscated by the Western occupying authorities for military purposes should be returned to their original owners; improve social insurance; and give women full and equal rights. The document says: We declare that Germans have the right to live freely, but the Bonn and Paris military treaties are threatening their free life. We declare that Germans have ownership rights to their land and all its subsidiary wealth. We declare that Germans have the right to work, but this right does not exist for millions of Germans as a result of Adenauer's pro-American policy. We declare that workers have the right to participate in economic management, and we demand the abolition of the anti-union "Law on the Status of Workers in Enterprises." We declare that the rights to freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and freedom of the press must be restored, freedoms which have been virtually abolished by Adenauer. We declare that the German working people must fight against the extraction of billions of profits by U.S. and British monopoly capital in West German enterprises. We declare that there is a right to unlimited freedom of trade between East and West Germany, a right that does not exist now due to Adenauer's and the Americans' policies. We declare that we will fight to break the "iron curtain" established by the imperialists, who have built this "iron curtain" to undermine the unity of German culture and hinder the consolidation of the connection between the two parts of Germany in science and art.

The document concludes by saying that we rely on the German working class, we rely on the German peasants, and we rely on the representatives of German culture. As long as they unite, they can build a new Germany. In this Germany, no one will conclude military treaties behind the backs of the people; in this Germany, the people decide everything; in this Germany, a democratic system will be realized because the dictatorship of West German monopoly capitalists over economic and political life has been abolished; in this Germany, no one will be unemployed and residents will live in a beautiful environment; this Germany will be free and strong because it is peace-loving and independent; in this Germany, national culture will flourish like a hundred flowers and will be connected with the humanitarian culture of all countries in the world; this Germany will live in peace with all other countries in Europe and have equal rights with them; this Germany will have close friendship with the Soviet Union and the peace camp. Such a Germany can and certainly will one day appear. German workers, peasants, teachers, workers in art and science, German youth, German women and mothers! You are the force that opens up the road to the future. The fate of Germany is in your hands. Nothing can stop your efforts. Give Germany what it needs! Use all your strength to build a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany!

    解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路
    ——德国统一社会党第四次代表大会通过的纲领性文件
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林八日电：德国统一社会党第四次代表大会通过了一个纲领性的文件：“解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路”。这个文件提出了德国工人阶级、劳动农民、知识分子以及所有爱好和平的德国人争取解决德意志民族的切身问题的斗争的原则。
    文件说，德国人民必须做出在他们的现代历史中的最严重的抉择。德国人民不能逃避这个抉择。他们必须二者择其一：或者是屈从于美国和进行战争，或者是获得德国的独立与和平。
    德国被分裂成两个互相对立的阵营。一个是和平力量的阵营，另一个是战争的阵营。
    文件接着指出，德国的爱好和平的力量正在努力争取实现一个统一、民主、和平与独立的德国与有关国家缔结和约；要求使德国摆脱外国的占领；主张尽速成立临时全德政府，负责筹备和举行自由民主的选举；希望西德能免付赔偿费，并在占领制未取消前将占领费减少到不超过国家预算的百分之五；致力于欧洲所有国家的和平合作及欧洲所有国家团结在集体安全体系内。另一方面，西德的战争势力正在竭力设法实现将使德国长期分裂并使西德变成军事基地的波恩条约和巴黎条约；主张将美、英、法三国对西德的占领保持到二十世纪末；希望在占领当局的控制下在德国举行不民主的选举，同意使西德继续偿付赔款；继续在西德居民身上榨取更多的巨额占领费；它们不要建立全欧集体安全体系，而力求在“欧洲防务集团”的幌子下建立西欧六个国家的狭隘的集团。
    文件接着说，德国人民必须在这两条道路，和平与战争的道路之中，选择一条。
    德国统一社会党是诞生在民族灾难深重的时候，在它的领导机构内和它的队伍内有反对军国主义、法西斯主义和战争的坚强的战士，它和全体爱好和平的人民共同为建立一个新德国而并肩斗争，现在它宣布：波恩与巴黎条约阻碍着德国的统一并为战争开辟道路。为了德国人的幸福，我们祖国的任何一部分都不能加入美英的军事同盟。如果德国要和平地生活下去，那末，必须抛弃关于“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约和波恩“一般性条约”，而且必须制止西德重新军国主义化。如果德国最后要统一，那末，就必须结束目的在维持德国分裂状态的美国对西德的干涉和统治，并必须取消占领法规。团结着爱国力量和民主力量的民主德国全国阵线在这一斗争中担当起了自己的历史任务。
    苏联已指出了和平解决德国问题的道路，并给予德意志民主共和国以主权。德意志民主共和国的独立自主，给全德国指出了一条道路，并鼓舞着西德的一切爱国力量为反对波恩与巴黎条约而加强奋斗。恢复德国的统一，只有德国人自己起来共同争取，才能实现。恢复德国的统一，只有通过民主的途径，才能实现。因此，目前最大的要求仍旧是：德国人聚首一堂！只有在这种情况下，即德国人在自由协商过程中互相接近了，德国东西两部的工人建立了联系，而农民和知识分子跟着他们走，我们才能克服战争的危险。所有的善良的德国人都希望结束我们民族的人为的分裂状态。因此，西德的爱国的人们就要团结起来，坚决奋斗，使波恩政府对他们的要求再不能置之不理。这样，就可以打开协商之门，共商德国人的切身的民族问题；就可以成立由西德与东德代表组成的联合委员会，以建立经济和文化联系；就可以就建立临时的全德政府问题达成协议。
    关于全德选举问题，在纲领性的文件中指出，这种选举应在不受外国干涉的情况下举行，应该不受占领当局的压力、不受西德垄断资本家和军国主义者的压力。在这方面，文件并且指出，德国的爱国者应该全力奋斗，反对军国主义宣传；争取举行全德谈判，以就下列各项问题达成协议：确定德国东西两部的警察人数，扩大东德与西德的贸易，确立销售人道主义书籍的自由，禁止传播军国主义思想的书籍；同时争取就全德代表权问题和保证德国和平与安全的和约的问题达成协议。
    纲领性的文件指出，缔结全欧集体安全条约就能保证欧洲的和平与安全。文件说，与全欧集体安全条约利害关系最大的莫过于德国人，因为缔结这个条约，就能使得德国两部分接近，就能保证德国全面的中立。文件着重说，只有苏联提出了在民主与和平的基础上恢复德国统一和独立的具体建议；而西方国家，首先是美国拒绝了这个建议。苏联给予了德意志民主共和国慷慨的帮助，并让德国这一部分得到主权。苏联向西德提议建立经济和文化的关系，并主张允许民主德国参加联合国作为平等的会员。我们像过去一样遵守着和各国人民保持友好关系的原则，并且实际上这样做。德意志民主共和国既然和苏联以及人民民主国家有着特别的友好关系，它也希望和所有资本主义国家发生友好关系，包括美国在内。
    文件中接着指出：现在在德意志民主共和国建立了真正民主的制度，而在西德，统治阶级正在压制民主和复活军国主义。文件中说：压制民主和复活军国主义，是一件事情的两个方面，其目标不外乎都是准备战争……摆在德国社会民主党党员以及西德工会会员面前的问题就是：他们是想为保证和平而斗争呢？还是愿意成为“欧洲防务集团”和西德与美国军国主义者共同准备的美国人的战争的牺牲品呢？柏林四国会议后的新的形势使得德国社会民主党有必要真正地改变方针，而以建立工人阶级的行动一致为方针……必须采取一切措施，以使德国两部分的工人联合起来，因为保持和平和德国的将来有赖于德国工人阶级的合作和行动的一致。必须以工人集团——所有的社会民主党工人、共产党工人、工会会员、无党派工人与基督教工人的集团，与在波恩各执政党的领导下在西德所组成的军国主义集团对抗。德国统一社会党与德意志民主共和国政府建议举行全德谈判，建议由东德和西德代表组成联合委员会以便在成立临时的全德政府这一问题上达成协议，这个政府的主要任务是筹备自由民主的全德选举。这些建议以及关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议是德国统一社会党的每
  一个党员以及西德各工会的每一个会员都可以接受的。我们向所有的社会民主党党员，各工会的会员和基督教工会会员伸出兄弟之手，为反对我们共同的敌人和德国军国主义而共同斗争。
    代表大会文件在以“德意志民主共和国——为建立新德国而斗争的堡垒”为标题的这一部分中，指出工业与农业方面的成就，并指出经济方面的任务，指出，工人阶级在德国统一社会党的领导下，在与劳动农民结成的联盟中，在与知识分子的合作下，在实现五年计划的事业中获得了显著的成就。在德意志民主共和国已开始建立社会主义的基础，并将完成这一历史任务。
    文件中又说到，德国统一社会党争取建立一个民主的德国。德意志民主共和国保卫着西德劳动人民的利益和全德国人民的利益，因而对西德提出下列要求：缩减占领费；停止支付赔偿费；发展德国国内贸易，与民主阵营发展贸易以消灭失业现象和工作日不足现象；降低广大居民的纳税负担，同时提高富户的利润税；制止提高物价；给迁居者以土地并进行民主的土地改革；被西方占领当局没收用作军事目的的七十万公顷土地应归还原主；改进社会保险；给予妇女以完全平等的权利。文件说：我们宣布：德国人有自由生活的权利，然而波恩和巴黎军事条约正威胁着他们的自由生活。我们宣布：德国人对他们的土地及其一切附属财富有占有权。我们宣布：德国人有劳动权，而这一权利，由于阿登纳实行亲美政策的结果，对于成百万的德国人是不存在的。我们宣布：工人有参加经济管理的权利，我们要求废除反工会的“工人在企业中的地位法”。我们宣布：必须恢复集会结社自由、言论与出版自由的权利，这些自由实际上已被阿登纳取消了。我们宣布：德国劳动人民要为反对美英垄断资本在西德企业中榨取亿万的利润而斗争。我们宣布：东西德之间有无限制的贸易自由的权利，而这一权利由于阿登纳和美国人的政策现在是不存在的。我们宣布：为打破帝国主义者建立的“铁幕”而斗争，他们建立这个“铁幕”是为了破坏德国文化的统一和阻碍德国两部分在科学与艺术上的联系得到巩固。
    文件最后说，我们依靠着德国工人阶级，我们依靠着德国农民，我们依靠着德国文化的代表者。只要他们团结起来，就能建立起一个新德国。在这个德国，不会再有人背着人民缔结军事条约；在这个德国，人民决定一切；在这个德国，由于取消了西德的垄断资本独裁者对经济和政治生活的统治而得以实现民主制度；在这个德国，没有人失业而且居民将在美好的环境下生活；这个德国将是自由的和强大的，因为它是爱好和平的和独立的；在这个德国，民族文化将如百花齐放，而且将和世界各国的人道主义文化发生联系；这个德国，将和欧洲所有其他国家和平相处并与它们有着同等的权利；这个德国，将和苏联与和平阵营有着密切的友谊。这样的一个德国能够，而且一定有一天会出现。德国工人、农民、教师、艺术和科学工作者、德国的青年、德国的妇女和母亲们！你们是开辟未来道路的力量。德国的命运就在你们的手中。任何东西都阻挡不了你们的努力。给德国以它所需要的吧！用一切力量来建立一个统一、和平、民主和独立的德国！
