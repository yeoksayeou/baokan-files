Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 18th: Special correspondent report: The US side is moving from obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) to attempting to fundamentally undermine it. A letter from the US Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission, Lacy, on the 15th to the commission, has clearly exposed this intention of the US side. In that letter, he slandered the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the commission, and viciously attacked the commission, saying: "The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has been paralyzed to the extent that it cannot fulfill the obligations it assumed as stated in the Armistice Agreement," asserting that it "will never be able to fulfill all of its obligations in the future." The US side's intensification of sabotage against the NNSC on the eve of the Geneva Conference is by no means accidental. It is part of the US side's all-out effort to create an atmosphere unfavorable to the Geneva Conference and intensify international tensions, with the aim of paralyzing or even overturning the NNSC, so that it can freely violate the Armistice Agreement, further destabilizing the already unstable Korean armistice situation, thereby blocking the road to peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through negotiations at the Geneva Conference.

Such groundless slander, abuse, and attacks on neutral countries invited by both sides to carry out their mission, as Lacy did, are rare in the history of international relations. The reason why this situation has occurred is not only due to the rudeness of the American generals, but mainly because the NNSC is an obstacle to the US side's violations of the Armistice Agreement.

Since the establishment of the NNSC on August 1st last year, the US side's means of resisting the NNSC's supervision work has been to use every possible means to obstruct and restrict the activities of the NNSC inspection teams, making it impossible for the teams to conduct effective inspections in the US side's areas. The Polish and Czechoslovak members have submitted a detailed report to the Military Armistice Commission, which provides a large number of facts in this regard. Just by looking at the minutes of the NNSC meetings, one can see that the NNSC has dealt with accusations against the US side from the NNSC inspection teams stationed at various ports in South Korea at almost every meeting. The US side does not notify the NNSC inspection teams to conduct inspections, prohibits the teams from boarding ships carrying war materials and from leaving the airport runways for inspections, refuses to open boxes containing war materials on the docks, and even prohibited the NNSC inspection teams from entering Incheon port to perform their duties on January 20th and 21st this year. Not only that, the US side has also wantonly carried out personal assaults and insults on the NNSC personnel, such as US personnel beating a Swedish secretary in Daegu, hijacking Polish personnel at Gangneung Airport, and repeatedly insulting and intimidating NNSC personnel.

The US side has also used various methods of concealment and deception to cover up its violations of the Armistice Agreement, such as using the name of disassembled parts and components, and using the method of underreporting imports and overreporting exports to massively import reinforcing war materials. However, these facts have been repeatedly exposed by the NNSC. Recently, the draft agreement on the comprehensive report on the rotation and replacement of both sides in October and November 1953 by the secretariats of the NNSC of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, confirmed that the rotation and replacement of the Korean-Chinese side "complied with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement," while the draft agreement, with more than 90% of its content, commented on the US side's rotation and replacement, listing facts and figures to expose the US side's non-compliance with the NNSC's requirements and violations of the Armistice Agreement.

In order to divert people's attention from the US side's violations of the Armistice Agreement, forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and illegally importing reinforcing war materials, the US side also made five false accusations against the Korean-Chinese side between November last year and February this year, accusing the Korean-Chinese side of detaining prisoners of war and importing reinforcing war materials, requesting the NNSC to send mobile teams to investigate. However, the US side could not provide evidence or specific locations that met the requirements of the Armistice Agreement for dispatching mobile teams, and was therefore rejected by the NNSC. Fair-minded neutral people can see very clearly that these false accusations by the US side are the same deceptive tricks as the US side's slander against the Korean-Chinese side for transporting warplanes into Yizhou Airport in boxes last October. After the mobile team conducted an investigation that time, it proved that the US side's accusations were completely fabricated.

It is precisely because the US side's violations of the Armistice Agreement and the means of obstructing inspections have been repeatedly exposed by the NNSC, and the US side's attempt to reduce the NNSC to its tool has failed, that the US side has become even more exasperated. It has wantonly abused the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the commission, and launched malicious attacks on the NNSC, attempting to sabotage the NNSC and shift the responsibility to others.

Who has tied the hands and feet of the NNSC? Who has made it unable to carry out its tasks smoothly? Those who respect the facts know that it is the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Warsaw, April 17th, Polish Press Agency: The Polish Press Agency has learned from reliable sources that Major General Lacy, the representative of the so-called United Nations Command in the Korean Military Armistice Commission, recently issued a statement shamelessly accusing the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission of their work. These accusations are not in accordance with well-known facts.

The Polish representatives in the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have done everything possible from the beginning to ensure that the Armistice Agreement is observed and to strive for lasting peace in Korea. However, their efforts have been constantly obstructed by those who are intent on maintaining the flames of aggression and igniting new ones.

Those who were once intent on obstructing the realization of the Korean armistice are now, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, doing everything possible to create difficulties and obstruct the reaching of an understanding at the Geneva Conference. They are unscrupulously intensifying international tensions.

Despite the various obstacles ahead, the Polish representatives of the NNSC will uphold the terms of the Armistice Agreement in accordance with the basic principles of Polish policy, and will unswervingly struggle to ensure that the Armistice Agreement is implemented and to maintain peace.

    美方加紧破坏中立国监察委员会
    波兰通讯社斥美方诽谤中立国监察委员会波捷代表
    【新华社开城十八日电】　本社特派记者报道：美方正从阻挠中立国监察委员会工作进而企图根本破坏中立国监察委员会。军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西十五日致该委员会的一封信中，已经明白地暴露出美方的这种用心。他在那封信里诬蔑委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员，并对委员会进行恶毒的攻击说：“中立国监察委员会已瘫痪到不能执行停战协定条款中陈述的它所承担的义务的那种程度”，断言它“今后也决不能履行其所承担的全部义务”。美方在日内瓦会议前夕加紧破坏中立国监察委员会决不是偶然的，这是美方正在全力推行的制造不利于日内瓦会议的气氛、加深国际紧张局势运动中的一部分，目的在于瘫痪甚至推翻中立国监察委员会，使它可以放手违反停战协定，使已经不稳定的朝鲜停战局势更加不稳定，从而堵塞日内瓦会议协商和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。
    像拉西那样对于由双方邀请去执行任务的中立国，毫无根据地进行诬蔑、谩骂、攻击，这在国际关系史上是不多见的。这种情形所以发生并不仅仅是因为美国将军们的粗暴无礼，而主要是因为中立国监察委员会对于美方违反停战协定的行为是一个障碍。
    从中立国监察委员会在去年八月一日成立以来，美方对于中立国监察工作采取的抵制手段就是用一切办法阻挠与限制中立国视察小组的活动，使小组无法在美方地区进行有效视察。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员已经向军事停战委员会提出一份详细的报告，其中提供了大量这方面的事实。只要翻翻中立国监察委员会的会议记录，就可以看到，中立国监察委员会几乎在每次会议上都在处理来自驻南朝鲜各口岸中立国视察小组对美方的指责，美方不通知中立国视察小组进行视察，禁止各小组登上载运作战物资的船只和离开飞机场跑道进行视察，拒绝打开码头上装有作战物资的箱子，甚至在今年一月二十日和二十一日禁止中立国视察小组进入仁川港口执行任务。不仅如此，美方还对中立国人员肆行人身侵犯和人格侮辱，如美方人员在大邱殴打瑞典秘书，在江陵机场劫持波兰人员，并曾一再对中立国人员进行侮辱和恫吓。
    美方也用了种种隐瞒和欺骗中立国的办法，来掩盖它违反停战协定的办法，如用拆散件和零件的名义、用少报运入多报运出的办法，大量运进增援性作战物资，然而，这些事实已为中立国监察委员会一再揭露。最近中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典、瑞士四国的秘书协议的关于一九五三年十月份和十一月份双方轮换和替换的综合报告的审定草案中，就证实了朝中方面的轮换和替换“符合停战协定的规定”，而该审定草案以百分之九十以上的篇幅评论了美方的轮换和替换，列举事实和数字揭露了美方不符合中立国监察委员会要求和违反停战协定的行为。
    美方为了转移人们对于美方违反停战协定强迫扣留朝中战俘和非法运入增援性作战物资的行为的注意，也曾在去年十一月到今年二月之间，五次对朝中方面诬控朝中方面扣留战俘和运进增援性作战物资，要求中立国监察委员会派遣机动小组进行调查。然而，美方却提不出根据，提不出符合停战协定规定的要求派出机动小组的具体地点，因而为中立国监察委员会所拒绝。公正的中立国人士看得很清楚，美方这些诬控和去年十月美方诬蔑朝中方面把作战飞机装箱运入义州机场是同样骗人的戏法。那次机动小组进行调查后，证明美方的指控完全是捏造。
    正因为美方违反停战协定的行为和阻挠视察的手段一再为中立国监察委员会所揭露，而美方企图使中立国监察委员会降为它的工具的阴谋未能得逞，所以美方就更加恼羞成怒了。它就对委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员大肆谩骂，对中立国监察委员会进行别有用心的攻击，企图破坏中立国监察委员会，而把责任转嫁到别人身上。
    谁束缚了中立国监察委员会的手脚？谁使它不能顺利执行任务？尊重事实的人都知道，那就是美国方面。
    【新华社十九日讯】　波兰通讯社华沙十七日讯：波兰通讯社自可靠方面获悉，朝鲜军事停战委员会中的所谓联合国军方面的代表拉西少将最近发表声明，无耻地指责中立国监察委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表的工作，这些指责是不符合于人所共知的事实的。
    朝鲜中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会中的波兰代表从一开始就尽一切力量，使停战协定得到遵守，并争取为朝鲜带来持久的和平。但是，他们的努力不断地遇到那些一心要保持侵略战火和点燃新的战火的人们的阻挠。
    这些曾经一心要阻挠实现朝鲜停战的人们，目前在日内瓦会议前夕，又在千方百计地制造困难，阻挠日内瓦会议达成谅解，他们在不择手段地加剧国际紧张局势。
    尽管前面的道路上有种种障碍，中立国监察委员会的波兰代表还是要本着波兰政策的基本原则来维护停战协定条款，并将坚持不渝地进行斗争，使停战协定得到履行，并维护和平。
