State-Owned Pharmaceutical Companies Actively Organize the Supply of Prepared Medicines to Rural Areas

State-owned pharmaceutical companies in many provinces and cities are actively organizing the supply of prepared medicines to rural areas, which is welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. When the mobile sales team of the Guizhou Provincial Company of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation supplied medicines to the Shiban Shao primary market in Guizhu County, many farmers said: "Your arrival is really good. Some unscrupulous merchants here used to take the opportunity to raise drug prices. When we got sick, we had to buy from them no matter how expensive they were." For example, each bottle of "Wogulin" eye drops was sold by the state-owned company for only 1,650 yuan, while private merchants sold it for 4,000 yuan. Many farmers hope that the sales team can go to the countryside regularly.

When organizing the supply of prepared medicines to rural areas, the Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, and Chongqing provincial and municipal companies of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation paid close attention to relying on supply and marketing cooperatives. The pharmaceutical companies in Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Shandong and other provinces give a 3% discount on wholesale prices when supply and marketing cooperatives purchase medicines. The Shanxi Provincial Company of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and many supply and marketing cooperatives have established a relationship of sending monthly requisition plans every quarter to ensure that supplies are carried out as much as possible in accordance with the requisition plans of the cooperatives. In addition to regularly printing brochures introducing the properties and uses of medicines and sending them to supply and marketing cooperatives, state-owned pharmaceutical companies in many regions also adopt methods such as carrying medicines to the countryside and delivering goods to the door to deepen business relationships with rural areas and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and help grassroots cooperatives formulate requisition plans. The Chongqing State-Owned Pharmaceutical Company, through local supply and marketing cooperatives and pharmacies, supplied approximately 10 million bottles (packages) of prepared medicines to rural areas in the fourth quarter of last year. The state-owned pharmaceutical companies in Xinxiang and Anyang, Henan Province, sent people to nearby rural areas to investigate the local medical equipment situation and the habits of the masses in using prepared medicines. Then, with reference to the seasonal disease patterns, they carefully selected some medicines needed by the local people and made full preparations for the supply.

At present, state-owned pharmaceutical companies in various places are actively strengthening the work of supplying prepared medicines to rural areas, and assisting supply and marketing cooperatives in training cadres who manage medicines. In addition to continuing to supply ordinary medicines, the Gansu Provincial Company of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation will appropriately add midwifery cotton and gauze, as well as bandages for external injuries and general medical equipment.

    国营医药公司积极组织成药下乡
    许多省、市的国营医药公司积极组织成药下乡，受到广大农民的欢迎。中国医药公司贵州省公司的流动推销组到贵筑县石板哨初级市场供应药品时，许多农民说：“你们来得真是好。这里原先有些奸商乘机抬高药价，我们生了病，再贵也得买他们的。”如每支“沃古林”眼药水，国营公司只卖一千六百五十元，私商却要卖四千元。许多农民都希望推销组能经常下乡。
    中国医药公司山东、河北、山西、黑龙江、重庆等省、市公司在组织成药下乡时，都很注意依靠供销合作社。黑龙江、山西、山东等省的医药公司在供销合作社购买药品时，都予以按批发牌价降低百分之三的优待。中国医药公司山西省公司和许多供销合作社建立了每季造送分月要货计划的关系，保证尽量按照合作社要货计划进行供应。许多地区的国营医药公司除经常印制介绍药品性能、用法等说明书，送给供销合作社外，还采取背药下乡、送货上门等办法，深入农村和基层供销合作社建立业务关系，并帮助基层合作社订要货计划。重庆国营医药公司通过各地供销合作社及药房等，于去年第四季度在农村供应的成药达一千万瓶（包）左右。河南省新乡、安阳的国营医药公司都曾派人到附近农村调查了各地医疗设备情况和群众需用成药的习惯等，然后参照季节发病规律，慎重地选择了当地群众需用的一些药品，充分进行了供应的准备。
    目前，各地国营医药公司正积极加强成药下乡工作，并协助供销合作社训练经营药品的干部。中国医药公司甘肃省公司等除继续供应普通药品外，将适当添加接生用药棉和纱布，以及外伤用绷带和一般医用器械等。
