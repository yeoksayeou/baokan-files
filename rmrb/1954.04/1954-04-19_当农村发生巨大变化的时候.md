When Tremendous Changes Occur in the Countryside
By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

Spring plowing began, and the CCP Echeng County Committee of Hubei Province received reports from various districts stating: "Since the publicity of the General Line, the masses' enthusiasm for taking the socialist road has soared to unprecedented levels, with many actively participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and throwing themselves into spring plowing. As early as the second day of the Lunar New Year, the masses began to weed and carry soil in the fields, breaking the habit of 'everyone going to the fields after the fifteenth day of the first month.' Wheat has generally been hoed two to four times, and fertilizer is being actively prepared..." In their reports, the districts rarely mentioned any problems in their work. If this situation had occurred in the past, the County Committee would naturally have been very satisfied; however, after studying the General Line, the County Committee's greatest criticism of its past work was its lack of in-depth and concrete leadership. Now, in order to improve this leadership method, the County Committee does not dare to be blindly optimistic about the positive reports from below, and has decided to investigate the true situation in one or two representative villages to see what is really happening.

The County Committee organized a group of cadres to go to Tiezui Township and Huarong Township in the Third District.

The working group sent to Huarong Township was led by Liu Fengkun, a member of the County Committee.

During the day, the men went to repair the dikes. Comrade Ke Anting from the County Committee working group talked with the mother of poor peasant Liao Chuanjia about the production situation. She said that they had one mu of wheat, on which they applied thirty jin of cake fertilizer last year, and top-dressed once; this year, they applied fifty jin of cake fertilizer and top-dressed twice. Another poor peasant, Liao Kemiao, also said that he had applied more fertilizer to his wheat this year than last year. In the evening, the people who had been repairing the dikes returned, and Ke Anting discussed the production situation with Liao Kesheng (a member of the township government), Liao Qiankun (deputy director of the credit cooperative), Liao Xinwei (a Party member), Liao Chuancai (a township representative), Liao Chuanying, and Liao Donggou (an agricultural group leader). They said that the masses' production enthusiasm was very high, that they had started weeding the wheat as early as the second day of the Lunar New Year, hoeing it a minimum of two times and a maximum of four times, and that everyone had pooled money to buy three hundred dan of night soil in Hankou, but had not been able to find any, so they were now stepping up their efforts to accumulate fertilizer. Ke Anting compared what they had said about the production situation with what he had learned during the day, and the masses' production enthusiasm was indeed good. However, Ke Anting was a careful person, and he delved deeper into the inquiry. He said:

"How is the sale of surplus grain going?"

"Thirty-five out of the forty-two households in this natural village sold surplus grain, selling 9,800 jin and receiving 4.9 million yuan," said Party member Liao Xinwei.

"How many farm tools have you added?"

For a long time, no one spoke. Finally, Liao Xinwei said:

"Two poor peasant households spent 40,000 yuan to buy a plow. There are now seven households lacking draft cattle, and three households have no farm tools at all."

"If you don't add farm tools, are you putting the money in the bank?"

"One poor peasant household has deposited 50,000 yuan."

"How many have joined the credit cooperative?"

"Forty-three shares. Among them, there are five middle peasant households who have not yet paid," said Liao Qiankun, deputy director of the credit cooperative.

"Why haven't they paid?"

"They said, 'Damn it, we're paying money, isn't it just to hire poor peasants?' (meaning: it will be given to hire poor peasants in the future)."

Finally, Ke Anting learned about their mutual aid and cooperation situation: In 1951, there were three mutual aid teams in this village. Because mutual aid was not mutually beneficial, they disbanded in 1952. After this sale of surplus grain, not a single mutual aid team had been established.

Ke Anting studied these situations: Everyone said that the masses' production enthusiasm was very good, but the masses were not adding farm tools, and mutual aid teams could not be established... What was going on? Then, Ke Anting also learned about the ideological situation of the masses at all levels.

There was little land in the village (an average of 1.05 mu per person) and many people. In the past, most of the poor peasants relied on sideline occupations for a living, but now many sideline occupations have been suspended. Ke Anting asked poor peasant Yang Jinghong why he didn't make chopsticks and brushes, and he said: "This time, you couldn't beat me into doing this bourgeois thing." Other poor peasants talked about why they dared not pick lotus roots and vegetables to sell, saying: "Now, who dares to be a spontaneous force!"

Middle peasants expressed various opinions on organizing mutual aid teams: Liao Zhengkun said: "The government calls on us to organize mutual aid, how dare we not participate? I only ask that farm tools not be shared." Liao Kehao said: "If we do it, we can only help each other temporarily, don't help each other for too long." Many people said this: Organizing together is like building a house and laying the foundation, everyone comes to fill the poor pit (i.e., mutual aid is to help hire poor peasants).

Based on these situations, Ke Anting further learned from the masses about their understanding of the General Line and the implementation of planned grain supply. One afternoon, Ke Anting chatted with eight farmers (six poor peasants and two middle peasants) and said:

"Why sell surplus grain?"

"To raise funds for the township's own expenses (i.e., the construction expenses of the township)," said Liao Daguo.

"To participate in the credit cooperative," said another person.

Ke Anting asked:

"What is the General Line?"

Some people shouted:

"Leveling."

"A common pot for everyone."

In order to make the situation comprehensive and accurate, the County Committee working group held a meeting of seventy-four township cadres and activists to study the information they had gathered. Everyone believed that these situations were real, and they had known about them for a long time, but the key was that they could not distinguish what the problems were, so they only reported the good aspects of the masses' production.

Liu Fengkun, a member of the County Committee, considering that the township cadres had problems with their understanding of the General Line, tested everyone, saying:

"How do you publicize the General Line?"

Everyone talked about the content of the publicity:

Some people said: "The General Line is to transform the individual economy into a collective economy. How to transform it? Implement the three major unifications: land, farm tools, and labor are collectivized."

Some people said: "Agriculture changes to industry, and we can get to socialism. There are still difficulties at present, and those who are well-off should help those who are in difficulty; leveling it out can lead to socialism."

Some people said: "Individual farming, doing business, and lending money are all 'spontaneous,' and 'spontaneous' is the capitalist road - an ugly road to death."

From the township cadres' conversation, the comrades of the working group were completely clear: Township cadres and activists had deviations in their understanding of the General Line, which caused the masses to misunderstand the General Line and have various concerns about production.

In order to solve this problem, the comrades of the working group continued to publicize the General Line to township cadres and activists at the meeting: Explaining the spiritual essence of the General Line; explaining specific policies such as mutual aid and cooperation, the rural class line, and the distinction between spontaneous trends and capitalism. Combined with this publicity of principles, they summarized the benefits of the Zhao Zhishan mutual aid team in this township compared to individual farming, and Zhao Zhishan made a report at the meeting, first introducing the achievements of the mutual aid team in the three years since its establishment: The grain harvested each year is 20 to 30 percent higher than that of individual farmers; originally six or seven of the ten households in the whole team had no food or drink, now there is no problem with food and drink; all ten households in the whole team lacked farm tools in the past, now most people have five major farm tools (waterwheel, plow, harrow, rake, and roller). Secondly, he introduced the specific methods by which the mutual aid team had solved problems such as mutual benefit in the past three years. Finally, the Zhao Zhishan mutual aid team exhibited the farm tools they had added in the past three years.

The meeting encouraged many people, and township cadres talked about it one after another: "This time we have clarified the principles: the General Line is not 'leveling' or 'a common pot for everyone', it is to let everyone take the road of getting organized and becoming prosperous together. The Zhao Zhishan mutual aid team is the example we should learn from." Liao Mengkang, a member of the township people's government, and Liao Sihai, a member of the Communist Youth League, said: This time we understand the principles of the General Line, and we can no longer just shout about mutual aid in words like in the past, but stand outside, we must actively participate in mutual aid and lead the masses. After the meeting, seventy-four township cadres and activists, according to the principles of the General Line publicized by the comrades of the working group at the meeting and the benefits of the Zhao Zhishan team's organization, divided up to publicize it among the masses. After hearing their publicity, the masses gradually eliminated their misunderstandings about the General Line and actively threw themselves into production. After clarifying the principles of the General Line, middle peasant Rao Santang excitedly talked to people: "Everyone hates the old road and wants to take the new road, but before I couldn't see through it and didn't dare to take it, now I understand it: the new road is to do a good job of mutual aid and cooperation." He took the initiative to connect five middle and poor peasant households to form a mutual aid team. People who dared not engage in sideline occupations in the past, now that they have heard the demarcation of "spontaneous forces", have restored some legitimate sideline occupations.

In order to launch a spring plowing production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, while continuing to publicize the General Line to the masses, twenty-one township government members and Party and League members took the lead in participating in mutual aid teams. Under their impetus, the township has developed from three mutual aid teams in the past to seven permanent mutual aid teams and seventeen temporary mutual aid teams. In addition, there are more than ten temporary mutual aid teams that are being brewed. The newly established mutual aid teams all learned from the Zhao Zhishan mutual aid team to formulate production plans, and the township government also formulated production plans for the whole township. In order to ensure the completion of the production plan, the whole township carried out pond repair, dam construction, and fertilizer accumulation movements (collecting lake grass, dredging pond mud, accumulating soil manure, etc.). Wheat has been hoed four or five times.

After the County Committee Secretary led a group of cadres to Tiezui Township to understand the situation, they found that after grain purchase and publicity of the General Line, cadres took the lead in participating in mutual aid and cooperation, developing two agricultural production cooperatives and seventy-nine mutual aid teams. However, due to the masses' misunderstanding of the General Line, there were many problems with mutual aid and cooperation. Of the seventy-nine mutual aid teams, thirty-five barely set up a framework without mutual aid content, eighteen were mutual aid without mutual benefit, three were fake mutual aid, and only twenty-three were voluntary mutual aid (including two who blindly studied agricultural production cooperatives and implemented public ownership of the means of production). Based on these situations, they, like the comrades working in Huarong Township, continued to publicize the General Line and clarify various specific policies in the whole township, thus gradually eliminating the ideological obstacles of the masses in production.

After the County Committee understood the situation in Huarong Township and Tiezui Township, it convened a meeting of district committee secretaries. Everyone was asked to first get a grasp of the current rural situation.

After listening to the County Committee's introduction of the situations and problems in Huarong Township and Tiezui Township, and comparing them with the situations in the townships they understood, the district committee secretaries realized that the masses at all levels had varying degrees of misunderstanding of the socialist road, which hindered the progress of spring plowing production. Many people reviewed that their past views on the work in the villages were paralyzed and blindly optimistic.

After the district committee secretaries reached a consensus with the County Committee on the understanding of the rural situation, the County Committee convened an enlarged meeting of district and township cadres to further understand the rural situation in the whole county. Everyone analyzed that the reason for these problems was that some district cadres had not correctly implemented the General Line, and some district cadres themselves had a vague understanding of the General Line. In response to these situations, the County Committee continued to publicize the General Line to district and township cadres: clarifying the principles of the General Line, explaining specific policies such as mutual aid and cooperation, and the rural class line; and Zhao Zhishan, the head of the mutual aid team in Huarong Township, introduced the benefits of their mutual aid team compared to individual farming and the specific methods of implementing the three major principles. District and township cadres all felt that this meeting was of great help to them. They excitedly said: This time, not only did we clarify the principles of the General Line, but we also saw what the Zhao Zhishan mutual aid team looked like on the new road!

At present, in the vast countryside of Echeng County, the movement to continue publicizing the General Line and carrying out spring plowing production centered on mutual aid and cooperation is underway.

    当农村发生巨大变化的时候
    本报记者  古维进
    春耕生产开始，中共湖北省鄂城县委会接到各区的汇报说：“自从宣传总路线以来，群众走社会主义道路的热情空前高涨，纷纷参加互助合作组织，积极投入春耕生产。大年初二群众就开始下田薅草、挑土，打破‘过了正月半，人人下田畈’的习惯。小麦一般锄到二遍至四遍，并积极准备肥料……”各区在汇报中，很少提到工作中有什么问题。这种情况，如果出现在过去，县委自然是很满意的；但是，学习总路线后，县委检查过去工作的最大缺点是工作不深入，缺乏具体领导。现在为了改进这种领导方法，县委对下面反映这样好的情况，不敢盲目乐观，决定研究一二个有代表性的村子的真实情况，看是怎么一回事情。
    县委组织了一批干部到第三区铁嘴乡和华容乡去。
    到华容乡去的工作组，由县委委员刘凤坤带领。
    白天，男人修堤去了，县委工作组同志柯安亭和贫农廖传甲的母亲谈起生产的情形。她说他们有一亩小麦，去年下了三十斤饼肥，追了一次肥；今年下了五十斤饼肥，追了二次肥。另一户贫农廖可苗谈起今年小麦上肥的情形，也说比去年多。晚上，修堤的人回来了，柯安亭和廖可胜（乡政府委员）、廖乾坤（信用合作社副主任）、廖辛未（党员）、廖传财（乡代表）、廖传英、廖东勾（农业小组长）几个人座谈生产情形。他们说，群众的生产情绪很高，大年初二下地薅小麦，顶少的薅二次，多的薅四次，大家曾集资到汉口去购买三百担大粪，没有买到，现在正加紧积肥。柯安亭把他们谈的生产情况和白天了解的生产情况一对照，群众的生产情绪的确是不错的。但是，柯安亭是个细心的人，他把访问深入下去。他说：
    “卖余粮搞得怎样？”
      “这自然村四十二户里有三十五户卖余粮的，卖了九千八百斤，得款四百九十万元。”党员廖辛未说。
      “添置了多少农具？”
    好半天没有人说话，末了，廖辛未说：
      “有二户贫农花了四万元买了一乘犁。现在有七户缺耕牛，有三户完全没有农具。”
      “不添农具，把钱存到银行去了吗？”
      “有一户贫农存了五万元。”
      “入信用合作社的有多少？”
      “四十三股。其中有五户中农还没有给钱呢。”信用合作社副主任廖乾坤说。
      “为什么不给钱？”
      “他们说，见鬼，我们出钱，还不是雇贫农用
  （意思是：将来要归雇贫农）。”
    末了，柯安亭了解他们互助合作的情形：一九五一年这村子有三个互助组，由于互助不互利，一九五二年散了伙，这次售余粮后没有搞起一个互助组。
    柯安亭研究了这些情况：大家都说群众的生产情绪很好，但是，群众不添置农具，互助组搞不起来……这是怎么一回事呢？接着柯安亭又了解各阶层群众的思想情况。
    村里地少（每人平均一亩零五厘地）人多，贫农过去大部分依靠副业为生，现在许多副业停顿了。柯安亭曾问到贫农阳景洪为什么不做筷子和刷帚，他说：“这一回，打死我也不敢做这个资产阶级的事情了。”另一些贫农谈到不敢挑藕、挑菜卖的原因说：“现在，谁敢当自发势力！”
    中农对组织互助组发表了各种意见：廖政坤说：“政府号召组织互助，哪敢不参加，我只要求农具不互助。”廖可好说：“要搞只能临时互助一会，不要互助长了。”不少的人这样说：组织起来像做房子打墙脚一样，大家都来填穷坑（即：互助是为了帮助雇贫农）。
    根据这些情况，柯安亭进一步向群众了解对总路线和粮食实行计划供应后的认识。一天下午，柯安亭和八个农民（六个贫农，二个中农）聊天，说：
      “卖余粮为了什么？”
      “为了给乡自筹经费（即乡村的建设经费）。”廖大国说。
      “为了参加信用合作社。”另一个人说。
    柯安亭问：
      “什么叫总路线？”
    有些人嚷开了：
      “拉平。”
      “大伙家。”
    为了把情况搞得全面、准确，县委工作组召开全乡干部、积极分子七十四人的会议，把了解的情况和大家研究。大家认为这些情况都是实在的，而且早就了解，关键是在于分辨不出这些情况是什么问题，所以就光汇报了群众生产好的一面。
    县委委员刘凤坤考虑到乡干部对总路线的认识有问题，便测验大家说：
      “你们怎样宣传总路线的？”
    大家纷纷谈起宣传的内容：
    有的人说：“总路线是把个体经济变成集体经济。怎样变？实行三大统一：土地、农具、劳力归公。”
    有的人说：“农业变工业，就能到社会主义。现时还有困难，好过的要把困难的拉一把；拉平了就能到社会主义。”
    有的人说：“单干、做生意、放账都是‘自发’，‘自发’即是资本主义道路——一条丑恶的死亡的道路。”
    从乡干部的谈话里，工作组同志完全清楚：乡干部、积极分子对总路线的认识有偏差，因此造成群众对总路线的误解，对生产存在各种顾虑。
    为了解决这个问题，工作组同志在会上给乡干部、积极分子继续宣传总路线：说明总路线的精神实质；说明互助合作、农村阶级路线、自发趋势与资本主义的区别等具体政策。结合这些道理上的宣传，他们总结了本乡赵芝山互助组比单干的好处，并由赵芝山在会上作报告，首先介绍互助组成立三年来的成绩：每年打的粮食比单干农民高百分之二、三十；原来全组十户曾有六、七户没有吃喝的，现在吃喝不成问题；全组十户过去都缺少农具，现在大部分人有五大农具（水车、犁、耙、耖、踩滚）。其次，介绍互助组三年来怎样解决互利等问题的具体办法。末了，赵芝山互助组把三年来增添的农具进行展览。
    会议鼓舞了许多人，乡干部纷纷谈论着：“这一次才把道理搞清楚：总路线不是‘拉平’‘大伙家’，是让大家走组织起来共同富裕的道路。赵芝山互助组就是我们学习的榜样。”乡人民政府委员廖孟康、青年团员廖四海等表示：这次明白总路线的道理，再不能像过去只在口头上叫喊互助，自己却站在门外，必须积极参加互助，把群众带动起来。会后，七十四个乡干部、积极分子根据工作组同志在会上宣传的总路线的道理和赵芝山介绍他们组织起来的好处，分头在群众中宣传。群众听了他们的宣传，逐渐消除对总路线的误解，积极投入生产。中农饶三堂明确了总路线的道理后，兴奋地和人谈着：“谁都痛恨旧道路，愿走新道路，但是以前看不透，不敢走，现在搞清楚了：新道路就是办好互助合作。”他主动串联五户中、贫农成立了互助组。过去不敢搞副业的人，现在听了划清“自发势力”的界限，都把一些正当的副业恢复起来。
    为了掀起以互助合作为中心的春耕生产运动，乡干部在给群众继续宣传总路线的同时，有二十一个乡政府委员和党团员带头参加互助组。在他们的推动下，全乡由过去的三个互助组发展到七个常年互助组和十七个临时互助组，此外，还有十多个临时互助组正在酝酿建立中。新成立的互助组都学习赵芝山互助组订出生产计划，乡政府也制订了全乡的生产计划。为了保证生产计划的完成，全乡进行修塘、筑坝，展开积肥运动（打湖草、捞塘泥、积土粪等）。小麦已薅到四、五遍。
    县委书记带领一批干部到铁嘴乡了解情况后，发现该乡在购粮和宣传总路线后，干部带头参加互助合作，发展二个农业生产合作社，七十九个互助组。但是，由于群众对总路线有误解，互助合作存在许多问题。在七十九个互助组里，勉强搭起架子没有互助的内容的有三十五个，互助不互利的有十八个，假互助的有三个，自愿互助的只有二十三个
  （其中二个盲目学习农业生产合作社实行生产资料归公）。根据这些情况，他们和在华容乡工作的同志一样，在全乡继续宣传总路线和阐明各种具体政策，于是逐渐消除了群众在生产中的思想障碍。
    县委摸清了华容乡和铁嘴乡的情况后，召开区委书记会议。要求大家首先都来把当前的农村情况摸一摸。
    区委书记听了县委介绍华容乡、铁嘴乡的情况和问题，同自己了解的乡的情况对照研究，认识到各阶层群众对走社会主义道路存在各种不同程度的误解，障碍着春耕生产的进展。许多人检讨了过去对村子的工作的看法是麻痹大意，盲目乐观。
    区委书记对农村情况的认识与县委取得一致后，为了进一步了解全县的农村情况，县委召开了区、乡干部扩大会议。大家分析产生这些问题的原因是有些区干部对总路线没有正确地贯彻下去，和有些区干部本身对总路线认识模糊。针对这些情况，县委对区、乡干部继续宣传总路线：讲清总路线的道理，解释互助合作、农村阶级路线等具体政策；并由华容乡互助组长赵芝山介绍他们互助组比单干的好处和实行三大原则的具体方法。区、乡干部都感到这次会议对自己帮助很大。他们兴奋地说：这一回，不仅把总路线的道理弄清楚，还看出赵芝山互助组走新道路的样子！
    目前，鄂城县的广大农村，正在继续宣传总路线，和以互助合作为中心开展春耕生产运动。
