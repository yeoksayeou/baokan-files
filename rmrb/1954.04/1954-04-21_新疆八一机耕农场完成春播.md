    Xinjiang Bayi Mechanized Farm Completes Spring Sowing
    The Bayi Mechanized Farm in Xinjiang Province has now completed its spring sowing tasks in a timely manner. The Bayi Mechanized Farm has more than 50,000 mu of cultivated land, of which spring sowing accounts for two-fifths. This year's spring plowing production work in the farm has been significantly improved compared to previous years. Before spring plowing, the farm compiled a spring plowing work schedule, and appropriately allocated labor and agricultural machinery and tools according to the cultivated area and crop types of each cultivated area. All agricultural machinery and tools were generally inspected, cleaned, or repaired, and all spring-sown crop seeds were treated with medicinal powder. In mid-March, when the accumulated snow had not completely melted, 3,000 mu of land was plowed. After the "ground temperature rose" in late March, sowing began, and all sowing work was completed within seven days. The tractor drivers of the farm gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in the spring plowing, and adopted the compound operation method, so that plowing and harrowing, sowing and compaction were carried out at the same time. In this way, after the seeds are put into the soil, they can absorb the snow moisture and emerge quickly.

    新疆八一机耕农场完成春播
    新疆省八一机耕农场现已及时完成春播任务。八一机耕农场共有五万多亩耕作面积，其中春播面积占五分之二。今年该农场的春耕生产工作，比往年有显著的改进和提高。春耕前，该场编好了春耕工作日程表，根据各耕作区的耕作面积和作物种类的不同，适当调配了劳动力和农机农具，将所有农机农具普遍进行了检查擦洗或修整，并将春播作物的种籽，全部进行了药粉拌种。在三月中旬积雪尚未完全消融时，就犁完了三千亩地。三月下旬“地温上升后，即开始播种，七天之内即完成了全部播种工作。农场的拖拉机手们在春耕中，充分发挥了积极性和创造性，采用了复式作业法，使犁地与耙地、播种与镇压同时进行。这样种籽入土后，可以吸收雪墒，迅速出苗。
