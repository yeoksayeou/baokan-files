Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on April 14th to discuss the establishment of a subcommittee in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 715 of November 28, 1953, and the communiqué of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting of February 18, 1954. Soviet representative Andrei Yan Vyshinsky spoke at the meeting, opposing the British proposal, which suggested that the subcommittee be composed of representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Canada.

Andrei Yan Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union believes that all the countries mentioned in the British proposal should be included in the subcommittee. Vyshinsky pointed out that British representative Dixon did not explain why the subcommittee should only include the countries he mentioned. This one-sided approach to the composition of the subcommittee is not in line with the United Nations General Assembly resolution mentioned in the preamble, nor with the communiqué of the Berlin meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.

Vyshinsky then spoke about the principles that the subcommittee must adhere to, and whether the British delegation's proposal is in line with these principles.

Vyshinsky said that when it comes to principles, we must first and foremost not forget that the most important thing in this matter is: the decisions we reach should be what the United Nations General Assembly, the people of all countries, and all of humanity expect. The solutions to the issues included in the subcommittee's agenda must end the arms race, must ensure that atomic and hydrogen weapons are prohibited, must eliminate the danger of another world war, and must help strengthen peace and international security.

Equally important in this regard is the issue of easing the burden of military spending on the people of all countries, a burden that is suffocating millions of people and preventing many countries from rationally using their resources to meet the needs of the vast majority of the people, to raise their living standards, and to improve the welfare of the people. In short, the issue here is to eliminate the military spending that accompanies the arms race, which is the case in many countries around the world.

Vyshinsky continued, saying that when we say we want to establish a subcommittee of the Disarmament Commission, that's what we mean. What I have said above is already sufficient to illustrate that the subcommittee must bear special responsibility for its activities, and the significance of its activities should not be underestimated.

Therefore, it is clear that countries that have the most at stake in the solution of this issue should be invited to participate in the drafting of a resolution, a resolution that everyone can accept – as stipulated in Resolution 715 passed by the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Does the British proposal, which is supported by the United States, France, and some other representatives, take these circumstances into account and make such considerations? I believe it is correct to give a negative answer to this question.

Although the British delegation's proposal also mentioned the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 715, and also mentioned the communiqué of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting of February 18, 1954, it in fact did not correctly take into account the important principles on which these two documents are based. Resolution 715, from its wording, has at least two provisions that are very important in principle. First, it stipulates that the Disarmament Commission consider whether it is appropriate to form a subcommittee composed of representatives from "primarily concerned states." At the same time, it does not say that the subcommittee should only include members of the Disarmament Commission. The British representative completely ignored this issue when explaining his proposal, and excluded some countries that have the most at stake in the solution of this issue and cannot be ignored in this matter from the subcommittee. Another principled provision stipulated in Article 6 of this resolution is that the subcommittee has the task of seeking mutually acceptable decisions. Not just any decision, but mutually acceptable decisions. Therefore, a decision cannot be reached through some kind of majority, because such a solution may be acceptable to the majority, but not acceptable to the minority, and these minorities have just as much at stake in the solution of this issue and have every right to demand that they be recognized as one of the primarily concerned states.

The British proposal disregards the provisions of the resolution, and I would like to say it more strongly, these are not just provisions, these are instructions from the United Nations General Assembly, because the resolution of November 28, 1953 – including Article 6 – is in fact an instruction given by the United Nations General Assembly to the Disarmament Commission. The importance of this instruction lies in the fact that it is of a mandatory nature. Therefore, the Commission has no right to interpret Article 6 in such a way that it conflicts with the basic principles and spirit of Resolution 715.

I think everything I have just said explains why I believe that the British proposal is an obviously one-sided document, a proposal that is obviously one-sided in nature. This kind of proposal does not help matters. First of all, according to the British proposal, the members of the subcommittee do not include the People's Republic of China, which means that the more than 500 million Chinese people, who play an undeniable role in the issue of disarmament, and the People's Republic of China, one of the legitimate permanent members of the Security Council, cannot send its legitimate representatives to participate in this subcommittee.

Second, the British proposal does not stipulate that the subcommittee should include other "primarily concerned states." I want to mention India and Czechoslovakia. The main task of the Disarmament Commission and the subcommittee is to make decisions on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Is it not obvious that it is very important for a country like India to participate in the work of the subcommittee when studying such decisions?

We firmly believe that allowing such "primarily concerned states" to join the subcommittee will truly comply with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 715 and will comply with the communiqué of the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which mentioned Article 6 of the United Nations General Assembly resolution, and this Article 6 stipulates that "primarily concerned states" should join the subcommittee.

The plan of "mutually acceptable decisions" stipulated in Resolution 715 is not accidental. This means that the resolutions passed by the subcommittee must be agreed upon by all members. Can a subcommittee that does not include representatives from the most relevant countries – the People's Republic of China, India, and Czechoslovakia – produce any such decisions? Their joining the subcommittee would eliminate the main shortcomings of the British proposal – its one-sided nature. This measure will make it entirely possible for the subcommittee to achieve truly unanimous resolutions. This measure will make it truly possible to seek a "mutually acceptable decision."

Therefore, we propose a subcommittee composed of the following countries: the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, France, India, Czechoslovakia, and Canada.

Since the People's Republic of China is one of the legitimate permanent members of the Security Council, and is undoubtedly a country that is primarily concerned with the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, its joining the subcommittee is completely natural and necessary, and should not cause any opposition.

It is equally indisputable that India is one of the countries that is primarily concerned with the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This is so obvious that I don't think it is necessary to present any arguments to prove it.

The right of Czechoslovakia and Canada to participate in the subcommittee is also undeniable. Their participation in the discussion on the issue of atomic weapons is also necessary, and the reasons are the same for both Czechoslovakia and Canada.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the list of members of the subcommittee advocated by the British proposal is one-sided, while we have proposed another list of members, and our proposal can ensure that the subcommittee conducts fruitful work in favorable conditions. We have put forward this plan because we do not want the work of the subcommittee to fall back into repeated generalities, or some one-sided resolutions that will not produce results. The Soviet Union has made such a proposal because this composition will conform to the important tasks that the subcommittee should complete, and will enable this subcommittee established by the Disarmament Commission to solve the problems entrusted to it.

Speaking next, the Danish representative said that the disarmament issue has attracted the attention of the entire Danish public, and everyone's attention is focused on this issue. He supported the British proposal and did not mention the Soviet delegation's proposal at all.

US representative Lodge said that the Soviet proposal was unwise because it advocated allowing representatives from the People's Republic of China to join the subcommittee. He said that "Communist" China is not a member of the United Nations and therefore cannot participate in the Disarmament Commission's subcommittee. He completely failed to mention the other two countries proposed by the Soviet delegation to participate in the subcommittee: India and Czechoslovakia.

French representative Openeau opposed the participation of the People's Republic of China in the work of the subcommittee and echoed the baseless arguments of the US representative. He tried hard to convince people that it was justified to refuse India and Czechoslovakia to participate in the subcommittee, on the grounds that the work of the subcommittee would be more "fruitful" in "meetings with limited membership" than in expanded meetings. He also said that India did not nominate itself at the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to request participation in the proposed subcommittee, nor did it propose the People's Republic of China.

British representative Dixon insisted that the British proposal complied with the United Nations General Assembly Resolution of November 28, 1953, and that adopting the Soviet proposal would "complicate" the work of the subcommittee.

New Zealand representative Munro said that the rules of procedure of the Disarmament Commission stipulate that the subcommittee can only be composed of members of the Disarmament Commission.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky spoke last in the discussion. He pointed out that the arguments against the Soviet delegation's proposal were unfounded and completely untenable.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the rules of procedure that Munro used to support his argument had nothing to do with the issue currently under discussion.

Vyshinsky continued, saying that Lodge was greatly mistaken, and this mistake is completely understandable from the perspective of his fundamental intentions. China has long been a member of the United Nations. The issue now is not at all about admitting China to the United Nations, but about the fact that a guy who no one can consider to be the Chinese people and the legitimate representative of China occupies China's position in the United Nations. Only the representative of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Central People's Government is the only legitimate representative of China. That's the point. Lodge insists on portraying the matter as an issue of admitting China to the United Nations. That's not right, that's not the issue. The issue is that the truly legitimate representative should occupy China's position in the United Nations. You think the current representative is the legitimate representative. But the whole world knows that the only legitimate representative of China is not the representative of Taiwan, but the representative sent by the government that expresses the will of the more than 500 million great Chinese people and is supported by them. Not the representative of the group that fled outside mainland China and entrenched itself on an island seized from the Chinese people with the help of the United States. Therefore, I don't think the issue is that China is not a member of the United Nations. China is a member of the United Nations, and the government of the People's Republic of China and the personnel appointed by this government are the legitimate representatives of China...

Now let me ask those who oppose our proposal and believe that the British proposal is correct, the only correct proposal: Where in Resolution 715 passed by the Eighth United Nations General Assembly on November 28, 1953, does it say which countries or major powers' representatives should make up this subcommittee? You can't find anywhere in the resolution that mentions this. However, you can find another statement (and it's not accidental), that is, the resolution mentions "primarily concerned states." Therefore, one cannot but think that if India is not participating, it is because it cannot be listed as a primarily concerned state. But can this withstand any rebuttal? Is this argument logical? ... Do you hope to achieve goals such as disarmament, ending the arms race, and banning atomic weapons? Are you willing to implement measures that can consolidate peace and consolidate international security? Do you think it can be done even if the Far East and Asia do not participate in this work? Do you think it can be completed and achieve some positive results even if Asian countries do not participate in this work?

I think that if the subcommittee ignores some major countries that account for nearly half of the world's population, and does not consider the opinions of the People's Republic of China with a population of 500 million and India with a population of 360 million, then whether its work will achieve results is highly questionable; if the Disarmament Commission or the subcommittee does not have these countries participating, and does not take into account these countries' and these major powers' armed forces, I also doubt whether the disarmament work will fail, and whether there will be any achievements in reducing armaments, or even in reducing military equipment.

These are unfounded assumptions, and these assumptions can only prove that they only intend to carry out the work of the Disarmament Commission and the entire disarmament work in an exclusive group.

Mr. Openeau said that five countries working will always be more effective than eight or ten countries working. If you reason like this, then can't you say that three countries working will be more effective than five countries working. Then it may be limited to the three Western powers – the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This would allow these three countries to carry out the work themselves, formulate some plans for themselves, without considering the opinions of others, and without considering other conditions. If you reason according to this logic, you might say that in this case, one country working is more effective than three countries working, because one country can completely let go. It doesn't need to consult with anyone, nor does it need to obtain anyone's consent. It can decide everything on its own. This is much simpler than three countries working, much simpler than five countries working, much simpler than ten countries working, and finally, much simpler than the entire United Nations working.

Perhaps the whole thing is like this: one country takes on all the work, it alone issues orders, or the three countries that make up the core of this committee take on all the work, and in fact they take care of everything. It is precisely because of this that I say that such a subcommittee is one-sided, and thus it goes without saying that it will endanger the success of the subcommittee's work.

Openeau said that the reason why the subcommittee does not include India is because India itself did not make a request. Does that mean that the Soviet Union has no right to suggest that India participate? Does that mean that the Soviet Union should only suggest that countries that have made a request participate? Not at all.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying: The Danish representative said that there is currently extreme concern in Denmark about the issue of disarmament and the reduction of armaments. This is completely understandable.

Not only in Denmark, but the whole world is extremely concerned about this matter. This issue has attracted universal attention and is considered to be an issue of special significance. It is especially important to free the work of the subcommittee from officialese, this should be a creative work, and those who can contribute to this work should not only be the countries of the exclusive group that will essentially control this subcommittee, and everyone knows that the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada are this exclusive group of countries. On the contrary, we want to eliminate this exclusive organization, the tendency of an exclusive group, so we propose to establish a subcommittee that is not one-sided.

Therefore, no political or legal reason is sufficient to prevent the adoption of our proposal. Therefore, the Soviet Union insists that the Disarmament Commission should seriously consider the Soviet proposal. We will insist that the countries proposed by the Soviet delegation should participate in the subcommittee, because we are convinced that ignoring the interests of these countries and ignoring the contributions that these countries can make to the work of reducing armaments and the struggle against atomic weapons will cause great losses to this major undertaking. I request the representatives of the Disarmament Commission to seriously consider this proposal, and I represent my government in insisting on this proposal.

### 维辛斯基在裁军委员会提出建议  由苏中美英等八国组成裁军小组

    维辛斯基在裁军委员会提出建议
    由苏中美英等八国组成裁军小组
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十六日电：联合国裁军委员会于四月十四日举行会议，讨论按照联合国大会一九五三年十一月二十八日的决议（第七一五号）以及一九五四年二月十八日柏林四国外长会议的公报成立小组委员会问题。苏联代表安·扬·维辛斯基在会上发言，反对英国的提案，这个提案建议由英国、美国、苏联、法国与加拿大的代表组成一个小组委员会。
    安·扬·维辛斯基说，苏联认为英国提案中提到的所有国家都应该包括在这个小组委员会里面。维辛斯基指出，不过英国代表狄克逊并没有解释为什么小组委员会只应该包括他所提到的国家。这种片面地解决小组委员会成员问题的办法是不符合序言中所提到的联合国大会的决议的，也不符合苏联、美国、英国与法国外长的柏林会议的公报。
    维辛斯基接着谈到小组委员会必须根据的原则，以及英国代表团的建议是否符合这些原则问题。
    维辛斯基说，谈到原则问题的时候，我们首先就不应该忘记，在这个问题上最重要的是：我们所取得的决定应该是联合国大会、各国人民与全人类所期望的，小组委员会的议程中所包括的问题的解决办法，必须结束扩充军备运动、必须确使原子武器与氢武器得到禁止、必须消除另一次世界大战的危险、必须有助于加强和平与国际安全。
    在这方面同等重要的是减轻各国人民的军事开支负担问题，军事开支的负担压得千百万人民喘不过气来，使得许多国家不能合理地利用他们的资源来满足广大人民的需要、来提高人民的生活水平并增进人民的福利；总而言之，这里问题就是要消除随同军备竞赛而来的军事开支，这是世界上好些国家都有的情况。
    维辛斯基继续说，我们说要建立一个裁军委员会小组委员会，意思就是这样。我以上所说的话就已经完全足以说明，小组委员会要为它的活动负特别的责任，对于它的活动的意义是不应低估的。
    因此，显然可见，应该邀请与这个问题的解决最有利害关系的国家参加来拟订一个决议，一个大家可以接受的决议——这是联合国第八届大会所通过的第七一五号决议所规定的。
    英国所提出的、得到美国、法国以及一些其他代表支持的提案考虑到这些情况，作了这样的斟酌吗？我相信对于这个问题给予否定的答复是正确的。
    英国代表团的提案虽然也提到了联合国大会的第七一五号决议，虽然也提到了一九五四年二月十八日柏林四国外长会议的公报，事实上恰恰没有正确地考虑到这两个文件所根据的重要原则。第七一五号决议，从它的条文来看，至少有两项规定在原则上说来是非常重要的。首先它规定裁军委员会考虑由“主要有关国家”代表组成小组委员会是否适宜问题。同时它并没有说小组委员会只应该包括裁军委员会的委员国。英国代表在解释他的提案的时候完全不谈这个问题，而把一些与这个问题的解决最有利害关系、在这个问题上不能被忽视的国家排除在小组委员会以外。这个决议的第六条规定的另外一项原则性的规定是小组委员会有任务谋求大家可以接受的决定。不是随便什么决定，而是大家可以接受的决定。因此不能通过某种多数来得到一个决定，因为这样一个解决办法可能是多数能够接受，但为少数所不能接受的，而这些少数与这个问题的解决同样有利害关系，也有充分的权利要求被承认是主要有关国家之一。
    英国的提案对于决议的规定置之不理，我愿意说得重一点，这不仅是规定，这是联合国大会的指示，因为一九五三年十一月二十八日的决议——包括第六条——事实上是联合国大会给予裁军委员会的指示。这一指示的重要性在于它是训令性质的。因此，委员会没有权利这样来解释第六条，使它与第七一五号决议的基本原则与精神冲突。
    我觉得我刚刚所说的一切说明我有理由认为英国的提案是显然片面的文件，是一种显然具有片面性质的提案。这种提案对事情是没有什么帮助的。首先，按照英国的建议，小组委员会的成员中并没有中华人民共和国，这就是说在裁军问题上有不容抹煞的作用的五亿多中国人民、安全理事会合法的常任理事国之一的中华人民共和国不能派出它的合法的代表参加这个小组委员会。
    第二、英国的提案没有规定小组委员会包括其他“主要有关的国家”在内。我要提的是印度和捷克斯洛伐克。裁军委员会和小组委员会的主要任务是就裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题上作出决定，在小组委员会研究这样的决定时，像印度这样的国家参加工作是很重要的，这难道不是很明显的吗？
    我们坚决认为让这样的“主要有关的国家”加入小组委员会将真正符合于联合国大会第七一五号决议，将符合于柏林外长会议的公报，这个公报提到了联合国大会决议中的第六条，而这第六条又规定应有“主要有关的国家”加入小组委员会。
    第七一五号决议中规定“大家可接受的决定”这样一个方案并不是偶然的。这意味着小组委员会所通过的决议必须得到全体委员的同意。一个不包括最有关的国家——中华人民共和国、印度和捷克斯洛伐克——代表的小组委员会可以产生任何这类的决定吗？它们加入小组委员会，就可以消除英国提案中的主要缺点——片面性质。这种措施将使得小组委员会完全有可能取得真正为全体委员所同意的决议。这种措施将使得真正有可能求得一个“大家可接受的决定”。
    因此，我们建议一个由下列国家组成的小组委员会：苏联、美国、中华人民共和国、英国、法国、印度、捷克斯洛伐克和加拿大。
    由于中华人民共和国是安理会的合法的常任理事国之一，而且无疑是与裁军和禁止原子武器问题主要有关的国家，它加入小组委员会是完全当然的和必要的，并且不应该引起任何反对。
    同样无容争辩的是，印度是与裁军和禁止原子武器主要有关的国家之一。这一点是那么明显，我以为根本没有必要提出任何论点来加以证明。
    捷克斯洛伐克以及加拿大参加小组委员会的权利，也是不可否认的。它们参加关于原子武器问题的讨论也是必要的，其理由无论在捷克斯洛伐克或加拿大来说都是一样的。
    维辛斯基最后说，英国提案所主张的小组委员会的成员名单是片面的，我们则提出了另一个成员名单，我们的主张可以保证小组委员会在有利的条件下进行有成果的工作。我们提出这个方案，也是因为我们不愿使小组委员会的工作又陷于反复重述一般的办法，或是一些不会产生结果的片面决议。苏联提出这样的建议是因为这种组成将符合小组委员会所应该完成的重要任务，并将使裁军委员会所设立的这个小组委员会有可能解决交给它处理的问题。
    接着发言的丹麦代表说，裁军问题引起了丹麦全体公众的注意，大家的注意力都集中在这个问题上。他支持英国的提案，只字不提苏联代表团的建议。
    美国代表洛奇说，苏联的建议是不明智的，因为它主张让中华人民共和国代表加入小组委员会。他说，“共产党”中国不是联合国会员国，因此不能参加裁军委员会的小组委员会。他完全没有提到苏联代表团提议参加小组委员会的其他两国：印度和捷克斯洛伐克。
    法国代表奥培诺反对中华人民共和国参加小组委员会工作，并附和美国代表的毫无根据的论点。他极力想叫人相信，拒绝印度和捷克斯洛伐克参加小组委员会是有道理的，他的理由是小组委员会的工作在“成员有限的会议”上将比在扩大的会议上更有“成果”。他还说，印度在联合国第八届大会上并没有自己提名要求参加建议中的小组委员会，也没有提出中华人民共和国。
    英国代表狄克逊硬说，英国的提案符合联合国大会一九五三年十一月二十八日的决议，通过苏联的提案，就会使小组委员会工作“复杂化”。
    新西兰代表孟罗说，裁军委员会议事规则规定，小组委员会只能由裁军委员会委员组成。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在讨论的最后发言。他指出，反对苏联代表团提案的那些说法没有理由，而且是完全站不住脚的。
    维辛斯基指出，孟罗借以支持自己的论断的议事规则与目前讨论的问题毫无关系。
    维辛斯基接着说，洛奇大大地弄错了，如果从他根本意图来看，这种错误是完全可以理解的。中国老早就是联合国会员国。现在的问题完全不在接纳中国参加联合国这一点，而是在于：一个没有人能认为是中国人民和中国的合法代表的家伙在联合国占据了中国的地位。只有中央人民政府领导下的中华人民共和国的代表才是唯一合法的中国代表。问题就在这里。洛奇硬要把事情说成是接纳中国参加联合国的问题。这是不对的，问题不在这里。问题在于：应由真正合法的代表在联合国中占有中国的位置。你们以为现在的代表是合法的代表。可是全世界都知道，唯一合法的中国代表不是台湾的代表，而是表现五亿余伟大的中国人民的意志，并获得他们的拥护的那个政府所派遣的代表。不是流亡在中国大陆以外，盘踞在借美国之助从中国人民手中夺去的岛上的那个集团的代表。所以，我认为问题并不在于中国不是联合国会员国这一点。中国是联合国会员国，中华人民共和国政府和这个政府所委派的人员是中国的合法代表……。
    现在试问一下反对我们的提案和认为英国的提案是正确的，是唯一正确的提案的人：第八届联合国大会一九五三年十一月二十八日所通过的第七一五号决议中有什么地方说到，是哪些国家或大国的代表应当组成这个小组委员会呢？你们找不到决议里有什么地方提到这样一点。然而你们可以找到另一种说法（而且不是偶然的说法），那就是决议里提到了“主要有关国家”。因此，不能不认为，如果没有印度参加，这是因为它不能被列为主要有关国家。但这难道经得起任何反驳吗？难道这种论断是合乎逻辑的吗？……你们希望达到裁军、终止军备竞赛、禁止原子武器这样一些目的吗？你们愿意实行一些能巩固和平、能巩固国际安全的措施吗？你们以为，即使远东和亚洲不参加这项工作，也能干成的吗？你们认为，即使亚洲国家不参加这项工作，它也可以完成，并获得某些积极的结果吗？
    我想，如果小组委员会忽视几占全世界一半人口的一些大国、不考虑拥有五亿人口的中华人民共和国和拥有三亿六千万人口的印度的意见，那么，它的工作是否会取得结果，就大成问题；如果裁军委员会或小组委员会中没有这些国家参加，不估计到这些国家、这些大国的武装部队，我也怀疑在裁军工作上会不落空，在裁减军备方面、甚至于在缩减军备方面会有所作为。
    这是毫无根据的设想，这些设想只能证明它们只打算在一个排他集团里进行裁军委员会的工作和整个裁军工作。
    奥培诺先生说，五个国家进行工作始终要比八个或者十个国家进行工作有效些。如果这样来推论的话，那末不是可以说三个国家进行工作要比五个国家进行工作更有效呢。这样也许就仅限于三个西方大国了——美国、英国和法国了。这就可以听任它们三个国家自己去进行工作，替自己制定一些什么计划，不必考虑别人的意见，也不必考虑别的条件。如果按照这种逻辑推断，也许可以说，在这种情况下，一个国家进行工作要比三个国家进行工作更为有效，因为一个国家就可以完全放手去干。它既不需要与任何人商量，也不需要征得任何人的同意。它独自可以决定一切。这要比三个国家进行工作简单得多，要比五个国家进行工作简单得多，要比十个国家进行工作简单得多，最后，要比整个联合国进行工作简单得多。
    也许整个事情就是这样：由一个国家担当一切工作，它一个人发号施令，或是由组成这个委员会的核心的三个国家担当一切工作，实际上就由它们来包办全部事情。正因为如此，我才说这样一种小组委员会带有片面性，因而不言而喻地会危及到小组委员会工作的成功。
    奥培诺说，小组委员会之所以不包括印度，是因为印度自己没有提出要求。难道说，因为这样苏联就没有权利建议印度参加吗？难道说，苏联只应该建议那些自己提出要求的国家参加吗？完全不是的。
    维辛斯基最后说道：丹麦代表说，目前在丹麦对裁军和缩减军备问题极其关心。这是完全可以理解的。
    不仅是在丹麦，就是全世界也极其关心这件事。这一问题已引起普遍的注意，并被认为是有特殊意义的问题。尤其重要的是，使小组委员会的工作摆脱官样文章，这应当是一项创造性的工作，能够对这一工作作出贡献的应当不仅是将在实质上把持这一小组委员会的排他集团的国家，大家知道，美国、英国、法国和加拿大就是这个排他的国家集团。相反地，我们要消除这种排他组织，排他集团的倾向，因而我们建议成立一个不带片面性的小组委员会。
    所以说，任何政治上以及法律上的理由，都丝毫不足以阻挠采纳我们的建议。因此苏联要坚持：裁军委员会应认真考虑苏联的建议。我们将坚持：苏联代表团所建议的那些国家应参加小组委员会，因为我们深信：忽视这些国家的利益，忽视这些国家参加裁减军备的工作和反对原子武器斗争所能作出的贡献，将使这一重大事务遭受巨大损失。我请求裁军委员会的代表们认真考虑这一建议，我代表自己政府坚持这一建议。
