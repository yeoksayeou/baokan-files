Theatrical performances across the country will become increasingly active. In cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin, as well as in provinces like Anhui, Sichuan, Henan, Hubei, Guizhou, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, theatrical troupes are currently staging plays that reflect China's real life, such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Forty Years of Wishes," "In the Face of New Things," "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits," "Steel Transportation Soldiers," "People Strive to Go Higher," "Before Wheat Harvest," "Grain," "Red Flag," "Seedlings Compete to Grow," "Moon Bay," and "Women Representatives." Various regions are also performing famous Soviet plays, such as "Julius Fucik," "One Cannot Live Like That," "Dawn Shines on Moscow," and "In the Mid-Twentieth Century." To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of the great Russian playwright Chekhov, the China Youth Art Theater will perform "Three Sisters," and the Beijing People's Art Theater will perform his one-act plays.

Excellent scripts from the "May Fourth" period onwards are also being prepared for staging by theater troupes in various regions. The China Youth Art Theater will perform Xia Yan's "Fascist Bacteria," and the Beijing People's Art Theater will perform Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm."

Theatrical performances for children will also increase. The China Children's Theater Troupe will stage "The Big Gray Wolf," "Be a Good Team Member," and "Young Pioneers and Volunteer Army Uncles."
