    Lambing Season Begins on the Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia
    Mongolian herdsmen living on the Hulunbuir Grassland in the northernmost part of our country are now entering the annual harvest season—lambing—with full confidence. The Hulunbuir Grassland already has more than 1.6 million head of livestock. This year, it plans to breed 640,000 head to support the country's socialist construction. Since last winter, the grassland has experienced heavy snow and cold weather, and the quality of the grass has been poor, resulting in generally weak livestock. In order to successfully complete the task of breeding livestock, the League and the Party and government leading organs of various banners have dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into various Sumu (districts) and settlements to conduct specific supervision. In order to prevent the phenomenon of milk deficiency in ewes due to physical weakness, the League's trade and cooperation departments have transferred 1.5 million jin of soybean cake and other feed to various banners as feed for weak ewes to prevent the death of young livestock due to insufficient milk from ewes. Various banners have held hundreds of training classes on lambing, actively improving methods of protecting young livestock. At the same time, various banners have generally improved the management of livestock sheds. Many Sumu and settlements have launched competition campaigns to do a good job in lambing. (Li Yi)

    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原开始接羔
    居住在我国最北部呼伦贝尔草原上的蒙古牧民，现正满怀信心地进入一年一度的收获节——接羔，呼伦贝尔草原原已拥有牲畜一百六十余万头，今年计划繁殖六十四万头，支援国家的社会主义建设，去冬以来，草原雪大天冷，草质不好，牲畜普遍瘦弱。为了胜利完成繁殖牲畜的任务，盟和各旗的党政领导机关，已调派了大批干部，深入各索木（区）和居民点，具体进行督导，为了防止母畜因体弱而发生的缺奶现象，盟的贸易合作部门，已调运一百五十万斤豆饼及其他饲料至各旗，作为瘦弱母畜的饲料，以免幼畜因母畜奶少发生死亡，各旗都举办了数百人的接羔训练班，积极改进保护幼畜的方法。同时，各旗普遍地改进了牲畜棚圈的管理工作，许多索木和居民点为着做好接羔，已展开竞赛运动。　（李翼）
