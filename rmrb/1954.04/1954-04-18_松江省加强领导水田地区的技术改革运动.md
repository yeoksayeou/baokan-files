To strengthen leadership over work in paddy field areas, the Agriculture Department and Water Conservancy Bureau of Songjiang Province convened a meeting of cadres in late March, including agricultural section chiefs, district heads, directors of water conservancy and irrigation stations, heads of paddy field technology extension stations, and county party committee researchers from across the province's paddy field areas.

The meeting summarized the experience of last year's paddy field work and discussed this year's tasks for technical reform in paddy fields. Last year, about half of the province's approximately 100,000 hectares of paddy fields implemented row sowing, spot sowing, transplanting, and mechanical dry sowing, resulting in a bumper harvest. The total rice production reached over 319,000 tons, an increase of 10.6% compared to 1952, and more than a dozen high-yield paddy field villages emerged, each producing over 10,000 jin of rice per hectare. However, due to the uneven development of cultivation techniques, chaotic irrigation management, and the impact of natural disasters, yields in some areas remained low. To increase the yield per unit area and total output of paddy fields, the meeting decided to continue carrying out the technical reform movement this year, strengthening leadership in low-yield rice areas and areas with both paddy and dry land. The meeting requested that over 70% of the province's paddy fields implement spot sowing, row sowing, appropriate transplanting, and focus on piloting mechanical dry sowing. Advanced areas should basically eliminate broadcast sowing and achieve rational fertilization and deep plowing and fine harrowing to fully utilize the yield-increasing effect of rational close planting. Attention should also be paid to continuous seed selection to improve seed quality. General areas should vigorously promote spot sowing and row sowing, advocate fertilization and deep plowing, and pay attention to creating high-yield models of spot sowing and row sowing in broadcast-sown villages and settlements to set examples. In colder mountainous areas, more early-maturing varieties should be planted. Rational irrigation is universally required to prevent pests, diseases, and disasters.

    松江省加强领导水田地区的技术改革运动
    为了加强对水田地区工作的领导，松江省农业厅和水利局，于三月下旬召开全省水田地区的农业科长、区长、水利灌溉站主任、水田技术推广站站长和县委研究员等干部会议。
    会议总结了去年水田工作的经验，讨论了今年水田技术改革的任务。去年全省约十万垧左右的水田中有二分之一的地区实行了条播、点播、插秧及机械干播，因而获得了丰收，水稻总产量达到三十一万九千余吨，比一九五二年提高了百分之十点六，并出现了十几个每垧产稻一万斤以上的水田丰产村。但由于耕作技术发展的不平衡、灌溉管理的混乱以及自然灾害的侵袭，有些地区收获量仍然很低。为了提高水田单位面积和总产量，会议确定今年继续开展技术改革运动，加强水稻低产地区和水旱田兼作地区的领导，要求全省百分之七十以上水田要实行点播、条播、适当插秧和重点试行机械干播。对先进地区要基本上消灭撒播，做到合理施肥和深耕细耙，以充分发挥合理密植的增产作用，并注意连年选种，提高种子质量。对一般地区要大力推广点播、条播，提倡施肥、深耕，并注意在撒播的村、屯搞好点播、条播的增产典型，树立榜样。在气候较冷的山区要多种早熟品种。普遍要求合理灌溉，防止病虫灾害。
