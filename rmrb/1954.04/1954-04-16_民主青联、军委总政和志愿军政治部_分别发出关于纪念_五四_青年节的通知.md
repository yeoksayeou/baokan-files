The All-China Youth Federation, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers have respectively issued notices on commemorating the "May Fourth" Youth Day.

The All-China Youth Federation stipulated three commemorative methods in its notice.

(1) Continue to conduct propaganda and education on the general line of the state's transition period to youth from all walks of life, and guide them to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call for "good health, good study, and good work." Localities can promote better study and work among youth from all walks of life by publicizing the positive performance of youth from all walks of life in the cause of building the motherland and the enthusiasm of minority youth in building a new life through newspapers and other means. (2) Coordinate with the Youth League's activities to commemorate the "May Fourth" Youth Day and organize youth from all walks of life to actively participate in various lively and educational activities. In these activities, youth from ethnic minorities, industry and commerce, society, religion, technology, and other fields should have more opportunities to contact workers and peasants and spend their festival together. (3) In large and medium-sized cities, small-scale symposiums of youth from all walks of life can be organized based on specific conditions to understand their opinions and requirements.

The notice from the General Political Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission called on the youth of the entire army to carry forward the glorious tradition of "May Fourth," deeply and systematically study the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, and strive to complete regular troop training and other tasks. The notice stated: Units will hold commemorative meetings, report meetings, cultural performances, sports competitions, symposiums of heroic models and meritorious personnel, and photo exhibitions, among other activities, according to their specific circumstances.

The notice from the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers called on all youth in subordinate units to heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, oppose any enemy conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice, and strive for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.
