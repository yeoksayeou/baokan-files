    Transportation Construction in the Mountainous Areas of Shanxi Province
    Wang Zhende, Director of the Transportation Department of the People's Government of Shanxi Province
    As a result of the restoration and opening of transportation, the vast mountainous areas of Shanxi Province, long considered to be "more rocks than people," are gradually being connected with cities.
    Two-thirds of Shanxi Province is mountainous, and many of these mountainous areas are old revolutionary base areas that have made great contributions to the revolution. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people in these mountainous areas personally eliminated the feudal system, established democratic political power, and lived a democratic life, creating favorable conditions for developing production and improving their lives. However, the traffic congestion in the mountainous areas still caused great suffering to the people there. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, it was difficult to transport agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, and special products such as timber, sulfur, mountain goods, peach kernels, and peppercorns out of the mountainous areas; daily necessities and farm tools were difficult to transport in, reducing the income of the local people and affecting the development of production. Even within a county, due to the inconvenience of transportation, coal produced in the third district was not easily transported to the fourth district, with the result that people not far from the coal mine still had to burn expensive coal. Even more, relatives in two neighboring counties had not seen each other for more than ten years because the roads were difficult to travel. There was a ditch beside Zhuangzi Village in Hequ County. Because there was no bridge, it was impossible to cross the ditch whenever there was a flood in summer and autumn. Sometimes people on this side of the ditch carried a bridal sedan chair in the morning to get married on the other side of the ditch, but a flood came in the afternoon, making it impossible to carry the sedan chair across for several days, delaying the auspicious time of the "wedding night." There were also people who went to farm across the ditch and were suddenly blocked by the flood, unable to return home for several days. Many people in the mountains have never seen a horse-drawn cart. In some dangerous road areas, even animals could not easily pass. There was a steep and dangerous slope on the mule track from Dingxiang to Yu County, which made people worry, so it was called "Worry Ridge." From Fanshi in Shanxi to Fuping in Hebei, the mule track of more than forty li had to cross the winding river one hundred and twenty times. Pedestrians who did not want to wade across the river had to cross the "Hand-Climbing Cliff," first crawling through with their heads and then climbing the cliff, often causing falls and injuries. The people called this difficult and dangerous road a "great scourge."
    The Communist Party and the People's Government have always been concerned with relieving the suffering of the people and supporting the development of production. In the "Instructions on Strengthening the Work in Old Revolutionary Base Areas" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on January 28, 1952, it was pointed out that "restoring and opening up transportation is the main key to improving the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas." On April 9 of the same year, the People's Government of Shanxi Province adopted the "Three-Year Construction Plan for Old Revolutionary Base Areas in Shanxi Province," which stipulated that, regarding the restoration and opening of transportation in old revolutionary base areas, in addition to repairing highways, it was also necessary to repair wagon roads, mule tracks, sidewalks, and riverbed roads to ensure smooth transportation in the old revolutionary base areas and to connect them with highways and railways. It also called for the development and full utilization of transportation tools such as iron-wheeled carts, rubber-wheeled carts, handcarts, and pack animals to solve the transportation difficulties in the old revolutionary base areas. According to the above instructions and regulations, the Transportation Department of the People's Government of Shanxi Province has been systematically and gradually carrying out the work of building and restoring transportation in mountainous areas. From the second half of 1952 to 1953, a total of 7.5 billion yuan was invested in building and restoring 24 wagon roads and mule tracks in mountainous areas, with a total length of more than 2,600 li. More than 200 bridges and culverts were built. Cadres and the broad masses of people at all levels of Party and government organizations in most mountainous areas have shown great enthusiasm and concern for road construction and have done their best to support it. When the wagon road from Zuoquan County to Tongyu Town was being built, Shenjiagiao Village, where the construction area was located, had only about 40 households, and workers had great difficulty finding housing. In order to solve the problem of worker housing, local residents voluntarily merged with each other to make room for the workers. They said, "If it weren't for building roads for us, you wouldn't have come here." The township head and the secretary of the township branch of the Chinese Communist Party went to the construction site every night to see what was happening, and if they encountered any difficulties, they would come back and discuss them with the masses to help solve them. When a bridge was being built between Shenjiagiao and Shibao Village, there was a shortage of wood for building the bridge. The township head discussed the matter with everyone, and many people voluntarily cut down their own trees to supply the bridge construction.
    Now, many dangerous roads in the mountainous areas have become safe avenues, bringing unlimited benefits to the people. After the wagon road from Wuzhai to Ningwu Dongzhai was built in 1952, it saved the people of Wuzhai 500 million yuan in charcoal burning costs in one year, and at the same time, timber from the area was transported out, increasing the income of the masses. After the wagon road connecting Sancha with Pianguan, Hequ, and Baode was built, the area's annual output of 5 million jin of sulfur was continuously transported out, and the daily necessities needed by the people could also be transported in, further developing agricultural production. After the wagon road from Jincheng to Tianjing was opened, the iron from Jincheng was transported out, and after the Panwu Road in Wuxiang was repaired, it solved the supply problem in the mountainous area of more than one hundred li east of Wuxiang. After the wagon road from Licheng to Xiangyuan was opened, the price of coal for civilian use dropped from 100 yuan per jin to 70 yuan. After the wagon road from Zuoquan County to Tongyu Town was opened, it solved the fuel difficulties of more than 20,000 farmers along the route. Zuoquan's fourth district alone transported out 200,000 jin of persimmon cakes, 80,000 jin of peanuts, 140,000 jin of peach kernels, 120,000 jin of hemp skins, and a large amount of peppercorns. These things could not be sold in the past due to traffic congestion. After the highway from Xi County to Xiaoyi was renovated, cotton, grain, oil, and a large number of mountain goods, sulfur, and coal from the three counties of Xi County, Yonghe, and Shilou were continuously transported out. Nearly 1,000 coal trucks traveled daily between Xiaoyi City and Duijiuyu Town alone.
    With the restoration and development of transportation, the production enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous areas has soared. The people's praise of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao is truly overwhelming. Some places held Yangko dances to celebrate when a road was built. In the winter of 1952, after the road from Sancha to Pianguan was built, the local people, in order to celebrate the opening of traffic (for wagons), hung a red flag on the first rubber-wheeled cart that arrived, with the words "Pioneer of the Sancha Line Opening." When the horse-drawn cart arrived in Pianguan, it was already dark, but many people still crowded out to see the horse-drawn cart, and the deputy county head personally entertained the horse-drawn cart workers. Now "Worry Ridge is no longer worrying" and "Hand-Climbing Cliff no longer needs climbing," and the masses said, "It really got rid of a great scourge." With transportation more convenient than before, the masses in many places have purchased livestock and repaired carts and horses, preparing to further develop transportation and expand production.

    山西省山区的交通建设
    山西省人民政府交通厅厅长　王振德
    恢复和开辟交通的结果，长久以来被认为是“多见石头少见人”的山西省广大山区，已逐步和城市联接起来了。
    山西全省有三分之二的地区是山区，有许多山区又是对革命有很大贡献的老根据地。山区人民，在共产党领导下，亲手消灭了那里的封建制度，树立了民主政权，过着民主的生活，给发展生产改善生活创造了有利条件。但是山区的交通阻塞，仍然给予山区人民巨大的痛苦。由于交通不便；使山区的农产品粮食、棉花、油料，特产品木材、硫磺、山货、桃仁、花椒等都不易运出来；日用百货，农具等不易运进去，减少了当地人民的收入，也影响着生产的发展。甚至在一个县境内，由于交通不便，三区出产的煤就不容易运到四区去，结果离煤窑不远的人还不得不烧高价的煤。更有这样的情况：两个邻县的亲戚，由于路不好走，十来年没有见过面。河曲县庄子村边有条沟，由于没有桥，每到夏秋期间一遇洪水，就无法过沟，有时沟这边的人上午抬着花轿去沟那边娶亲，下午来了洪水，使花轿好些日子都抬不过来，耽搁了“洞房花烛”的佳期。也有过沟种地的人，突遇洪水阻拦，好几天都回不了家。山区有许多山地的人是从来没有见过马车的。更有一些险路地区，连牲口都不易走过。定襄通往盂县的驮骡路上有一处陡坡险路，使人望而生愁，所以名叫“愁梁”。从山西繁峙到河北阜平之间，四十多里驮骡路就要过一百二十次盘肠河，行人不愿涉水过河，就得过“手扒崖”，先钻过头去再扒崖而过，经常发生跌伤事故。人民把这种艰峻的险路叫做“大害”。
    共产党和人民政府从来就是关心解除人民生活痛苦，扶助人民生产发展的。一九五二年一月二十八日中央人民政府政务院关于“加强老根据地工作的指示”中就曾指出：“恢复与开辟交通，这是改善老根据地人民生活的主要关键”。同年四月九日，山西省人民政府又通过了“山西省老根据地三年建设工作计划”，其中关于恢复与开辟老根据地交通问题规定：除修复公路外，还要修复大车路、驮骡路、人行道、河滩道，做到老根据地交通畅通，和公路线、铁道线联结起来。并以发展和充分利用铁轮马车、胶轮马车、手推车、驮畜等交通工具，解决老根据地交通运输的困难。根据上述指示和规定，山西省人民政府交通厅有计划地逐步地进行了修建和恢复山地交通的工作。从一九五二年后半年到一九五三年共计投资七十五亿元，修建和恢复了山区大车路、驮骡路二十四条，共长约二千六百多里。修建桥涵二百多处。大部山区的各级党、政组织的干部和广大群众，对于修路工作，都表现得十分热情和关心，尽力支援。在修建左权县至桐峪镇的大车路的时候，工区所在地申家峧村，只有四十来户人家，工人住房十分困难，当地居民为了解决工人住房问题，都自动的相互合并，给工人腾住处。他们说：“要不是为了给我们修路，请你们来你们也不会来的。”该乡的乡长和中共乡支部书记，每天晚上必到工地去看看，遇有困难，便回来和群众商量，帮助解决。在修建申家峧至石暴村间的桥梁时，缺乏搭桥木料，乡长便和大家商量这件事，许多群众便自动地将自己的树砍下来供搭桥用。
    现在，山区的好多险路，已经变成了平安大道，带给了人民无限好处。一九五二年五寨到宁武东寨的大车路修好以后，一年就给五寨人民节省了五亿元烧炭费，同时运出当地的木材，给群众增加了收入。三岔通偏关、河曲、保德的大车路修好以后，该地年产五百万斤的硫磺便源源运出，人民需用的日用品也能运进来了，农业生产由此得到进一步发展。晋城到天井的大车路修通以后，运出了晋城的铁，武乡的蟠武路修好以后，解决了武乡东百余里山区供应的问题。黎城到襄垣的大车路修通以后，民间用煤的价格由一百元一斤降到了七十元。左权县到桐峪镇的大车路修通以后，解决了沿线两万多农民的燃料困难，仅左权四区就运出了柿饼二十万斤，花生八万斤，桃仁十四万斤，麻皮十二万斤和大量的花椒，这些东西过去因交通阻塞是没有销路的。隰县至孝义的公路整修好以后，使隰县、永和、石楼三县地区的棉花、粮食、油料以及大量山货硫磺、煤炭等源源运出，仅孝义城到兑九峪镇之间，每日拉煤车就将近一千辆。
    交通恢复和发展了以后，山区人民的生产情绪更是随之高涨。人民对共产党、人民政府和毛主席的歌颂真是欢声载道。有的路一修成，当地群众就开会扭秧歌庆祝。一九五二年冬，三岔到偏关大路修成以后，当地人民为了庆祝通车（大车），还给首先来到的胶轮大车挂了红旗，上写“三岔线通车先锋”。当马车到达偏关时，天已黑尽，很多人仍拥出来看马车，该县副县长还亲自招待了马车工人。现在“愁梁不愁了”“手扒崖不扒了”，群众说“真是除了大害”。交通较前方便，许多地方的群众都纷纷购买牲畜，整顿车马，准备进一步开展运输和扩大生产。
