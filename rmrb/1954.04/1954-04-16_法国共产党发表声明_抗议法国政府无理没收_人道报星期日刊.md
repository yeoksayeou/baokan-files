(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th) According to TASS, the French government authorities ordered the confiscation of the April 11th "l'Humanité Sunday Edition". The confiscated "l'Humanité Sunday Edition" contained an article striving for peace in Vietnam and exposing American interference, entitled "Indochina Bloodshed Has High Prices on the New York Stock Market." The French Communist Party issued a statement in protest to the government.

The "l'Humanité Sunday Edition" also published Zhou Enlai's congratulatory telegram for "l'Humanité's" 50th anniversary, as well as many facts proving West German re-militarization.

"l'Humanité" published an extra edition to protest the French government's confiscation of the "l'Humanité Sunday Edition," with the headline: "'l'Humanité Sunday Edition' Confiscated Because It Spoke the Truth About Dulles' Conspiracy to Expand the Indochina War."

"l'Humanité" called on all French working people to support the Communist Party's newspapers, strengthen unity in the struggle against the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, for peace in Vietnam, and to defend democratic freedom. The newspaper protested the police's barbaric actions, saying, "No unjust means or baton rule can prevent 'l'Humanité' from being the standard-bearer of national independence and peace."

    法国共产党发表声明
    抗议法国政府无理没收“人道报星期日刊”
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国政府当局下令没收了十一日的“人道报星期日刊”。被没收的“人道报星期日刊”上面刊登了一篇争取越南和平、揭露美国干涉的文章，题目是“印度支那流血在纽约股票市场行市很高”。法国共产党为此特发表声明，向政府提出抗议。
    “人道报星期日刊”还刊登了周恩来祝“人道报”创刊五十周年的贺电以及证明西德重新军国主义化的许多事实。
    “人道报”为抗议法国政府没收“人道报星期日刊”而出版了号外，上面刊着这样的通栏标题：“‘人道报星期日刊’被没收，因为它说出了杜勒斯阴谋扩大印度支那战争的真相。”
    “人道报”号召法国所有的劳动人民支持共产党的报纸，在反对波恩条约和巴黎条约、争取越南和平及保卫民主自由的斗争中加强团结。这个报纸抗议警察的蛮横行动说：“任何非正义手段或警棍统治，都不能妨碍‘人道报’成为民族独立与和平的旗手。”
