    The advanced and intermediate-level groups of cadres studying theory in various localities are about to begin studying Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents.
    Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" mainly narrates the major problems encountered and resolved during the period from 1926 to 1929 in the Soviet Union's realization of socialist industrialization. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people restored the national economy destroyed by the war from 1921 to 1925. From 1926, they launched a great struggle for the cause of national socialist industrialization. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the people to overcome enormous difficulties and finally achieved victory in the industrialization policy. Our country, since last year, has entered a stage of planned economic construction and systematic transformation of non-socialist economic components. The most central task of this stage is to gradually realize national socialist industrialization. It can be seen that studying Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents, and researching the extremely rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its struggle to realize national socialist industrialization, is of great significance to us.
    The upcoming study of Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" will be carried out after studying the Party's General Line for the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. This is a good condition, which makes us feel more intimate and easier to understand when studying the theory and experience of Soviet socialist economic construction. Therefore, in organizing and leading this study, all localities should fully estimate this situation and make full use of this favorable condition to make the study more in-depth and effective. To this end, cadres participating in the study should be pointed out that,
  the many important issues described in Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", such as the difficulties in the period of socialist industrialization, the focus on developing heavy industry and relying on internal accumulation to solve the funds for industrialization, the backwardness of agriculture and the policy of agricultural collectivization, the adoption of the first Five-Year Plan and the socialist labor competition, the intensification of class struggle and the necessity of the struggle against agents of hostile classes within the Party, are of extremely important reference significance to us and should be focused on for in-depth study. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully read the original text of Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and related documents, earnestly draw on the knowledge of the laws of socialist economic construction and political struggle from the historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and study it in connection with the actual situation in our country. In this way, we can improve our understanding of the Party's General Line for the transition period. In this way, we can get great help in overcoming the various difficult problems we have encountered and will encounter in the process of industrialization in our country.
    However, precisely because this study is conducted on the basis of studying the Party's General Line for the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, a complacent mood may arise in the minds of cadres, thinking that there is not much to learn from Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". And this complacent mood is very harmful. Indeed, the gains from the study and propaganda of the Party's General Line for the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session are extremely great. It enabled all cadres to initially recognize the transformation of the nature of the revolution in our country and the specific path to building our country into a great socialist country, thereby unifying the thinking of cadres at a new level, and it gave all cadres a new starting point for their work. In this study, the Marxist-Leninist consciousness and combat effectiveness of the cadres have been greatly improved. The entire Party and state work has begun a major transformation and improvement as a result. However, because the time for this study and propaganda is not long, and also because of the insufficient theoretical preparation of the majority of cadres, many cadres' understanding of the Party's General Line for the transition period is still very unsystematic and very in-depth. There are still many problems that have not been resolved in their understanding and thinking. First of all, many cadres' understanding of the extreme importance of socialist industrialization to our country and its difficult and complex nature is very insufficient. The necessity of socialist industrialization for the highest interests of the people of our country, and the necessity of concentrating efforts and saving consumption to develop heavy industry, has not been fully understood or truly understood by many cadres. This is manifested in the fact that they cannot wholeheartedly and happily accept the principle that the improvement of life must be subordinate to the needs of production development; they adopt a negative and passive attitude towards the implementation of planned procurement and planned supply of certain major agricultural products, and therefore they cannot carry out effective persuasion and education on certain erroneous viewpoints existing among the masses of the people. Secondly, many cadres' understanding of the necessity of vigorously overcoming the backwardness of agricultural development and the leading role of the working class in the cause of the worker-peasant alliance is still very unclear. The development of industrialization is bound to put greater and greater demands on agricultural production. Many cadres not only do not have enough understanding and preparation for this point, but some even doubt why they should first concentrate their efforts on developing heavy industry, or doubt whether the speed of industrialization is too fast. In addition, many cadres (more rural work cadres) understanding of the current worker-peasant alliance is still very superficial, or even incorrect. They still do not understand that the purpose and basis of the current worker-peasant alliance is to lead the peasants to establish a socialist society that eliminates classes. The socialist transformation of agriculture cannot be finally completed without the technical foundation provided by modern large-scale industry. Because they do not understand this principle, they often mistakenly and superficially describe the current worker-peasant alliance as a simple "urban-rural mutual assistance," "workers and peasants hand in hand." In this way, they will naturally be unwilling to accept and recognize the leading position of the working class in the cause of the worker-peasant alliance. Obviously, this is completely incorrect. Thirdly, regarding the intensification of class struggle in our country during the transition period, and its inevitable nature of becoming increasingly fierce and complex, there was an almost ignorant state among many cadres before the Fourth Plenary Session. After studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, many cadres have been greatly surprised. However, many cadres' understanding of class struggle is still very superficial. Some cadres turn a blind eye to the actions of certain bourgeois elements who corrupt and buy off workers, and provoke disunity within the working class. Some cadres cannot identify and criticize the fallacies that provoke worker-peasant unity and the erroneous arguments of certain "theories of class struggle mitigation." Some rural work cadres lack a clear understanding of the policy of relying on poor peasants in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The essence of this state is the ambiguity of class stand and the loss of revolutionary vigilance against the inevitable resistance of the overthrown class and the class to be eliminated. In addition, the erroneous view that a very small number of cadres still have, which denies that the capitalist economic components in our country still have a certain positive role, should also be corrected. Fourthly, among many cadres, the understanding of the significance of strengthening the Party's leadership and strengthening the Party's unity and solidarity is still very insufficient. Among them, the serious situation of the lack of political and ideological work, and the extremely dangerous proud mood and serious manifestations of individualism that endanger the Party's unity, have not yet aroused enough attention and profound criticism. In addition to these problems, many cadres' study of the Party's General Line for the transition period is still very incomplete. For example, many cadres in industrial departments do not pay much attention to studying the socialist transformation of agriculture, and some even openly express "no interest"; while cadres engaged in rural work, some only want to study the parts that are related to themselves. Not long ago, the CPC Handan Prefectural Committee conducted a test on the Party's General Line for the transition period in the mutual aid and cooperation meeting. In the answers of sixty-two cadres who participated in the test, in describing the content of the Party's General Line for the transition period, two-thirds of them did not mention the national socialist industrialization; among the twenty-five county-level cadres, ten failed. This very serious phenomenon must not be regarded as an isolated example and ignored. In fact, as long as you conduct an in-depth inspection, you will find that the cadres' study of the Party's General Line for the transition period is not "almost" but much worse. The complacent mood that the study and propaganda of the Party's General Line for the transition period has been "almost" is completely unfounded.
    Therefore, the study of Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" should be carried out seriously with greater effort. It is necessary to guide everyone to further study the theory and experience of Soviet economic construction in this study and in the future study of Chapters Eleven and Twelve of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", and to further clarify the problems that have not been resolved in the study of the Party's General Line for the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session. In this study, the method used in the study of Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" should still be adopted, that is, to study the theory through the study of concrete historical facts, to prevent separating from the concrete historical conditions, and to grasp individual conclusions for isolated study. Because the latter method is actually a completely dogmatic method that violates Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the phenomenon of not reading carefully, talking casually about practical work at discussion meetings, and turning study meetings into work discussion meetings. Because this study method is not "integrating theory with practice", but refusing to study theory in the name of so-called "integrating theory with practice".
    Finally, in carrying out the study of Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", it is necessary to change the serious procrastination that has occurred in the past studies, especially in the studies of many senior groups. Since the Party's General Line for the transition period has already been studied, it is entirely possible to have a faster pace of study of Chapter Ten of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". In the future, we must advocate reading carefully and completing the study schedule on time. In addition, some Party organizations and leading cadres shirk their leadership responsibilities for theoretical study, and some core groups and leading cadres do not study themselves or fail the exams. Strict criticism should be carried out for these phenomena. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the CPC Ningxia Provincial Committee conducted inspections and made announcements on many unhealthy phenomena in the study of certain units at the end of March. The method they adopted is completely correct. In this study, the propaganda departments of the Party committees in various localities must overcome the generalized leadership methods in theoretical education work, must earnestly conduct investigations and studies on the learning and ideological conditions of cadres, and seriously criticize the serious state of pride and complacency of many senior group leaders, who do not study and are actually blindly ignorant of many of the Party's basic policies. Only in this way can the study of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" achieve the greatest effect.

    怎样学习“联共（布）党史”第十章
    ——“学习杂志”一九五四年第五期社论
    各地干部理论学习的高、中级组，即将开始学习“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件了。
    “联共（布）党史”第十章主要是叙述一九二六年到一九二九年期间苏联实现社会主义工业化过程中所遇到的各种重大问题和解决的经过的。苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在一九二一年到一九二五年期间，恢复了被战争破坏的国民经济，从一九二六年起，展开了为国家的社会主义工业化事业的伟大斗争。苏联共产党领导人民克服了极大的困难，终于取得了工业化政策的胜利。而我们的国家，从去年起就进入了有计划的经济建设和对非社会主义经济成分实行有系统的改造的阶段，而这一阶段中最中心的任务，也就是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化。由此可见，学习“联共（布）党史”第十章和有关文件，研究苏联共产党为实现国家的社会主义工业化而斗争的极丰富的经验，对我们是有极大的意义的。
    即将开始进行的“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习，是在学习党在过渡时期的总路线和党的七届四中全会文件之后进行的。这是一个好条件，它使我们在学习苏联社会主义经济建设的理论和经验的时候，会感到更亲切而容易理解。因此，各地在组织和领导这一学习时，应该充分估计到这种情况，并充分利用这一个有利的条件，使学习能更深入、更有效果。为此，应该向参加学习的干部指出，
  “联共（布）党史”第十章所叙述的许多重要的问题，如社会主义工业化时期中的困难，着重发展重工业和依靠内部积累来解决工业化的资金，农业的落后和农业集体化的方针，第一个五年计划的采取和社会主义劳动竞赛，阶级斗争的尖锐化和反对党内敌对阶级代理人斗争的必要性等，对于我们都有着极重要的参考意义，都是应该着重深入学习的。因此，必须认真阅读“联共（布）党史”第十章的原文和有关文件，认真从苏联共产党历史经验中，汲取社会主义经济建设和政治斗争的规律性的知识，并联系我国的实际情况加以研究。这样，就能够使我们对党在过渡时期的总路线的理解提高一步。这样，就能够使我们在克服我国工业化过程中已经遇到和将要遇到的各种困难问题的时候，得到很大的帮助。
    但是，正因为这一学习是在学过党在过渡时期的总路线和四中全会文件的基础上进行的，也可能在干部思想中产生一种认为“联共（布）党史”第十章已没有多少可学的自满情绪。而这种自满情绪是十分有害的。确实，党在过渡时期的总路线和四中全会文件的学习和宣传的收获是极为巨大的，它使全体干部初步认识到我国革命性质的转变，和把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的具体的道路，因而使干部的思想在新的水平上统一了起来，它使全体干部对自己的工作得到了一个新的出发点。在这一学习中，干部的马克思列宁主义的觉悟和战斗性大大提高了。整个党和国家工作已由此开始了重大的转变和改进。可是，由于这一学习和宣传的时间还不长，也由于多数干部理论准备的不足，因此，许多干部对于党在过渡时期的总路线的理解还是很不系统、很不深入的。他们在认识上和思想上还存在着许多问题没有解决。首先，许多干部对于社会主义工业化对我国极重要的意义和它的艰巨复杂的性质，是理解得很不够的。社会主义工业化是我国人民最高利益，以及集中力量、节约消费来发展重工业的必要性，对于许多干部说来，并没有完全理解或真正理解。这就表现在他们对于生活的提高必须服从于生产发展的需要的原则，还不能衷心愉快地接受；他们对于某些主要农产品实行计划收购和计划供应采取消极被动的态度，因而他们对于人民群众中存在的某些错误的观点不能进行有力的说服教育。其次，许多干部对于大力克服农业发展的落后的必要性，对于工农联盟事业中工人阶级的领导作用，还认识得很不明确。工业化事业的发展，必然要对农业生产提出愈来愈大的要求，许多干部对这一点不仅没有足够的理解和准备，有的人甚至还因此怀疑何必首先集中力量发展重工业，或者怀疑工业化的速度是否太快。此外，许多干部（农村工作干部更多一些）对于当前工农联盟的理解，还是极表面的，甚至是不正确的。他们还不理解当前工农联盟的目的和基础，就是领导农民建立消灭阶级的社会主义社会。而农业的社会主义改造，没有现代化大工业提供的技术基础，是不可能最后完成的。由于不懂得这一条原理，他们常常把当前的工农联盟错误而肤浅地说成是简单的“城乡互助”，“工农手拉手”，这样，他们对于工农联盟事业中的工人阶级的领导地位，自然就会不服气、不承认了。显然，这是完全不正确的。第三，关于我国过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐化，和它必然带着日益激烈和复杂的性质，在四中全会以前，在很多干部中间存在着几乎是懵然无知的状态。在学习四中全会文件之后，许多干部已经大吃一惊，但是，许多干部对阶级斗争的认识还十分肤浅。有些干部对于某些资产阶级分子腐化和收买工人、挑拨工人阶级内部团结的行动熟视无睹，有些干部对于挑拨工农团结的谬论和某些“阶级斗争缓和论”的错误论调不能识别、不能批判。有些农村工作干部对于互助合作运动中依靠贫农的方针缺乏明确的认识。这种状态实质上就是阶级立场的模糊，和对已被打倒的阶级和将被消灭的阶级的必然的反抗失去了革命警惕性。另外，在极少数的干部中间还存在着否认当前我国资本主义经济成分还有一定的积极作用的错误观点，也要注意纠正。第四，在许多干部中间，对于增强党的领导作用，增强党的统一、团结的意义，了解得还十分不够，在他们中间，对于缺乏政治思想工作的严重情况，对于危害党的团结的极端危险的骄傲情绪和严重的个人主义的表现，都还没有引起足够的重视和深刻的批评。除了这些问题以外，许多干部对于党在过渡时期的总路线的学习，还是很不全面的。例如许多工业部门中的干部对于学习农业的社会主义改造问题很不重视，有的人甚至公开表示“没有兴趣”；而担任农村工作的干部，有的也只愿学习和自己有关的部分。不久以前，中共邯郸地委曾在互助合作会议中进行关于党在过渡时期的总路线的测验，六十二个参加测验的干部，在叙述党在过渡时期的总路线的内容的答案中，竟有三分之二的人没有提到国家的社会主义工业化；在二十五个县委级干部中间，竟有十个人不及格。中共延庆县委书记认为党的农村工作路线是以贫农为领导。峰峰矿区王凤煤矿党的总支书记把总路线的实质说成“统购统销，稳定物价，灾区不饿死一个人”。这种十分严重的现象，决不能只看作个别的例子而加以忽视。事实上，只要深入检查，就会发现干部对于党在过渡时期的总路线学习的情况并不是“差不多”而是差得很多，那种认为党在过渡时期的总路线的学习和宣传已经“差不多”了的自满情绪，是完全没有根据的。
    因此，对于“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习，应该以更大的努力来认真进行。必须引导大家在这一学习和今后“联共（布）党史”第十一章、第十二章的学习中，进一步学习苏联经济建设的理论和经验，并进一步弄清在学习党在过渡时期的总路线和四中全会文件中未解决的问题。在这一学习中间，仍旧应该采用在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章时所采用的方法，即通过学习具体的历史的事实来学习理论，防止脱离具体的历史条件，抓住个别的结论孤立进行学习的错误方法，因为后面这种方法，实际上就是完全违背马克思列宁主义的教条主义的方法。另一方面，也要反对不认真读书，在讨论会上漫谈实际工作、把学习会变成工作讨论会的现象。因为这种学习方法并不是什么“理论和实际联系”，而是在所谓“理论和实际联系”的名义下面，拒绝学习理论而已。
    最后，在进行“联共（布）党史”第十章的学习时，必须改变过去学习中特别是许多高级组学习中的严重拖沓状态。由于已经学过了党在过渡时期的总路线，所以，对“联共（布）党史”第十章学习进度较快是完全可能的。今后必须提倡认真读书，按时完成学习进度计划。另外有些党的组织和领导干部，推卸对理论学习的领导责任，有些核心组和领导干部自己不进行学习、或考试不及格；对于这些现象，应该进行严格的批评。中共河北省委和中共宁夏省委宣传部在三月底曾对某些单位学习中的许多不健康的现象进行检查并加以通报，他们所采取的这种方法是完全正确的。在这一学习中，各地党委宣传部必须克服在理论教育工作中一般化的领导方法，必须认真进行对干部学习情况和思想情况的调查研究，对于许多高级组的领导干部骄傲自满，不进行学习而实际上对党的很多基本政策盲目无知的严重状态，进行严肃的批评，只有这样，才能使“联共（布）党史”的学习收到最大的效果。
