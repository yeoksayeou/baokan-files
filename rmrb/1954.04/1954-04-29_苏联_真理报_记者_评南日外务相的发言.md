Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 28th: TASS Moscow, April 28th: "Pravda" special correspondents Zhukov, Prishevsky and Rasazkin reported from Geneva that general attention here is focused on the concise, powerful, and well-reasoned speech of Nam Il, the chief representative of the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This speech stood in stark contrast to the empty and inflammatory remarks of the South Korean representative. Even bourgeois observers who studied Nam Il's concrete proposals for restoring Korean national unity and holding all-Korean elections privately admitted on the 27th that only his attitude was in accordance with the requirements of peace and security.

As for the South Korean representative's speech, it was purely dictated by the American propaganda aimed at stirring up war hysteria. His slanderous attacks on the great Chinese people and the heroic Korean patriots—who repelled the attacks of the American aggressors and their allies in a very arduous struggle—once again proved a fact that everyone has long known: the Syngman Rhee gang, forcibly stuffed into South Korea by the American occupation authorities, has nothing in common with the Korean people. It places the interests of the occupiers above everything else.

The difference between Nam Il's speech and such irresponsible and provocative remarks is like day and night. His speech was permeated with deep inner dignity, patriotic conviction, and confidence in his moral superiority. This speech was closely followed by all participants.

The final plan for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question proposed by Nam Il is fully in line with the vital interests of the Korean people and the vital interests of all people who are willing to work for the consolidation of peace and security. This plan first of all takes into account the need to achieve the unification of Korea, which the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been striving to do since its establishment. On the other hand, it is impossible to unify Korea into one country without ensuring Korea's true independence. Therefore, the proposal put forward by the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulating that all foreign armed forces should withdraw from Korean territory within six months will naturally be supported by all peace-loving people.

The "Pravda" reporter continued that some figures active behind the scenes of the Geneva Conference knew that the proposals of the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would arouse widespread interest and sincere sympathy. Therefore, on the evening of the 27th, they tried in every possible way to "manipulate" reporters in an attempt to get the newspapers to distort the proactive efforts of the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These people, who dictate policy to the bourgeois newspapers, told reporters in secret that they should make it seem as if only the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea could guarantee peace in Korea. The source of this "idea" can obviously only be the American diplomatic kitchen. Its knack for fabricating all kinds of absurd lies is well known.

The reporter pointed out that the suggestions put forward by the Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to ensure the democratic nature of a unified Korea are very important. The reporter concluded by saying that only the establishment of a unified, independent and democratic country can guarantee the final peaceful settlement of the Korean question. For all countries that are most concerned about maintaining peace in the Far East, their task is to ensure the peaceful development of Korea in order to create conditions for the early peaceful unification of Korea into an independent and democratic country.

### 苏联“真理报”记者  评南日外务相的发言

    苏联“真理报”记者
    评南日外务相的发言
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：“真理报”特派记者茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金自日内瓦报道，这里的一般的注意力都集中在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团首席代表南日的简洁有力、论据充足的发言。这篇发言和南朝鲜代表的空洞而带煽惑性的发言适成强烈的对照。甚至研究了南日关于恢复朝鲜国家统一和举行全朝鲜选举的具体建议的资产阶级观察家二十七日在私下谈话中也不得不承认，只有他的态度才是符合和平与安全的要求的。
    至于南朝鲜代表的发言，它纯粹是由企图煽起战争歇斯底里的美国宣传的意图所支使的。他对伟大的中国人民和英勇的朝鲜爱国者——他们在非常艰苦的斗争中击退了美国侵略者及其盟国的进攻——的诽谤性攻击，再一次证明了一个大家老早就已知道的事实：由美国占领当局硬塞在南朝鲜的李承晚匪帮，与朝鲜人民毫无共同之处。它把占领者的利益看得高于一切。
    南日的发言和这种不负责的和挑衅性的发言的分别，有如白昼之与黑夜。他的发言贯串着深刻的内在尊严、爱国信念和相信自己在道义上占优势的信心。这个发言受到全体与会者的密切注意。
    南日所提出的最后和平解决朝鲜问题的方案，完全符合朝鲜人民的切身利益，符合一切愿意努力争取巩固和平及安全的人民的切身利益。这个方案首先考虑到必须实现朝鲜的统一，这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府从成立时起就一直在努力做的。另一方面，如果不保证朝鲜的真正独立，那就不可能把朝鲜统一成为一个国家。因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团所提出的规定所有外国武装部队在六个月内撤出朝鲜领土的建议，自然会受到一切爱好和平的人民的支持。
    “真理报”记者继续说，某些在日内瓦会议幕后活动的人物知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的建议将引起普遍的兴趣和真诚的同情，因此他们在二十七日晚上就多方设法“摆布”记者，企图使报纸歪曲朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的主动努力。给资产阶级报纸规定方针的这些人，背地里对记者们说，他们应该把事情说成好像只有中国人民志愿军一方面撤出朝鲜，朝鲜的和平才能有保证。这种“主意”的出处显然只能是美国的外交厨房。它的善于捏造种种无稽谎言是出了名的。
    记者指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团建议保证统一的朝鲜的民主性质，这些建议是非常重要的。记者最后说，只有建立了统一、独立和民主的国家，才能保证朝鲜问题的最后和平解决。对于一切最关怀维持远东和平的国家来说，它们的任务便是保证朝鲜的和平发展，以便创造条件，促使朝鲜早日和平地统一成为一个独立和民主的国家。
