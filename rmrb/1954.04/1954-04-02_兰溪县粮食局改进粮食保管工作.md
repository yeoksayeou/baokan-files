Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Lanxi County Grain Bureau Improves Grain Storage Work
    A letter from the Lanxi County People's Government Grain Bureau, Zhejiang Province: We fully accept the criticism from reader Chai Benying published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on January 20th, regarding our bureau's lack of attention to grain storage work. The reasons for the excessive moisture content in the grain are: we did not adequately educate our inspectors, and many inspectors were not sufficiently proficient in their work, so that when receiving new grain into storage, they did not properly implement the policy of "superior grain, superior price, pricing according to grade"; in addition, a period of continuous rain also increased the difficulty of grain storage. However, the main problem was that we did not promptly process the sorghum rice we purchased with higher moisture content, resulting in unnecessary losses of state assets. After seeing the reader's criticism, we immediately convened a meeting of all cadres from the urban grain depot, examined our work attitude, and conducted thorough criticism of the personnel involved; and relayed this information at the county-wide district grain warehouse director's meeting to raise everyone's awareness. Therefore, the reader's criticism was very helpful in promoting the improvement of grain storage work in our county, especially the staff of the Ma'anxu and Xiaka sub-warehouses in the urban area, who corrected their work attitude and conducted a thorough inspection of the stored grain.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    兰溪县粮食局改进粮食保管工作
    浙江省兰溪县人民政府粮食局来信：一月二十日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者柴本莹对我局不重视粮食保管工作的批评，我们完全接受。造成粮食水分过高的原因是：我们对验货人员教育不够，不少验货员业务不够熟练，以致在接收新粮入库时，没有很好贯彻“优粮优价、分等论价”的政策；加上有一个时期连日阴雨，也增加了粮食保管的困难。但更主要的问题是，我们收购了水分较多的高粱米没有很快进行适当处理，以致造成了国家资财不应有的损失。我们看到读者批评以后，立即召集了城区粮库全体干部座谈，检查了我们的工作态度，对有关人员进行了深刻的批评；并在全县各区粮食仓库主任会议上进行了传达，以引起大家警惕。因此读者的批评对推动我县改进粮食保管工作是很有帮助的，特别是城区马安徐、下卡等分仓的工作人员都因而端正了工作态度，并对存粮作了一次彻底的检查。
