A Powerful Tool for Spreading Scientific Knowledge
—On the Importance of Science Education Films and Their Status in China
Hong Lin, Director of the Science Education Film Studio

    After establishing feature films and newsreels, China's film industry began to establish a new type of film in 1952—science education films.
    Science education films are an important form in the film industry. As early as 1920, Lenin advocated for this type of film and believed that it should have "the nature of an illustrated popular lecture." He demanded "a wider and more systematic use of film for production propaganda." He once wrote to the Supreme National Economic Council and other agencies, asking them to "show the work of the newly invented method of peat hydraulic mining to many party members and masses on film." [Note 1] Following Lenin's instructions, Soviet scientists and filmmakers, through close cooperation, created many excellent Soviet scientific films, which have become the most advanced and brilliant example of world science films. In recent years, the Soviet Union has produced about two hundred popular science and teaching films every year. These films have widely promoted the Soviet Union's new achievements in science and technology, and many films have reached a very high level in artistic expression and technology. For example, the latest "Agricultural News" Issue 9 clearly and meticulously explains the great advantages of the new method of planting potatoes, cabbage, and other crops—the square-cluster planting method. It can mechanize the cultivation of these crops. The promotion of this new method brings great benefits to collective farms because it reduces the labor required for collective farmers to grow these crops. "Pravda," in its commentary, pointed out that such a good film should be sent to every collective farm, state farm, and agricultural machinery station so that all agricultural workers can see it.
    Regarding the important role of popular science films, the late President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Komarov, wrote: "I think this cause is one of the most important causes at the moment. Films can introduce scientific knowledge to the broadest masses of the people. No other method can guarantee such wide dissemination of scientific knowledge. Moreover, after watching these films, you will see that things that are difficult to explain in other ways can be explained very clearly on the screen. Books, pictures, vivid language, and various experiences cannot express things as accurately, clearly, and fascinatingly. Films combine all of these. I would also like to say that popular science films are a prominent example of the combination of art and science." [Note 2]
    Science education films can become assistants to scientific research work, recording the object and process of research most truthfully and accurately on film. The outstanding Soviet scholar Pavlov personally led the filming of "The Structure of the Brain" and "The Nervous System" and other films. The progress of modern film technology has greatly expanded the scope of scientific research films, making it possible to film many phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye with a movie camera.
    Science education films can also be used as tools for teaching and technical training. They enable teachers to use small screens to explain various courses to students, in addition to blackboards, wall charts, and models. The excellent Soviet science films "Automobile Driver Tutorial" and "Tractor Tutorial" have trained millions of people in the Soviet Union to drive cars and tractors. The Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries regularly use films in higher, secondary, primary, and technical schools to assist teaching.
    Due to various limitations in our country, we have not yet started the production of such research films and teaching films (except for the filming of a very small number of films teaching advanced technologies). Our science education films started with popular science films that are closely related to the broad masses of the people. This kind of film is a powerful tool for spreading scientific knowledge. It educates the broad masses of the people on basic scientific knowledge, introduces China's important achievements in science and technology, and explains natural and social phenomena from a materialist point of view.
    Since May 1952, the Central Film Bureau established a science education film creation organization. In that year, a total of thirteen films were shot, including "Eliminating Locusts," "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," and "Advanced Bricklaying Method." The Science Education Film Studio was officially established in February 1953, and nine films such as "Soil and Water Conservation" and "Eradicating Rice Pests—Rice Stem Borers" were successively shot. At present, in addition to this film studio specializing in the production of science education films, the Beijing and Shenyang health education film institutions under the Central Ministry of Health have produced a number of health education films such as "Corneal Transplantation," "Fighting Against Plague," and "Eliminating Flies"; the Agricultural Film Studio under the Central Ministry of Agriculture has produced several agricultural education films such as "Wheat Seed Selection." This year, the Science Education Film Studio of the Central Film Bureau has begun to shoot and prepare to shoot fifteen films such as "Preventing and Controlling Schistosomiasis," "Overcoming High Temperatures in Factories," "Rubber," "Soybean Rhizobia," and "Freshwater Fish Farming" and four newsreels of "Science and Technology." Judging from the production of science education films in China, although China's science education film industry is still in its infancy, it has had a good start. The films have begun to meet the broad audience and have won their love.
    In promoting advanced experience and technology in the industrial sector, films such as "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," "Advanced Bricklaying Method," and "Li Xikui Shunting Method" have been filmed, which can vividly explain the basic spirit of these advanced work methods, using the method of comparing the old and the new to illustrate the superiority of the new methods. In agriculture, films have been produced that focus on eliminating the two major agricultural pests in China—locusts and rice stem borers: "Eliminating Locusts" and "Eradicating Rice Pests—Rice Stem Borers," which tell the audience the life history of locusts and rice stem borers and explain the methods of eliminating these pests, giving people confidence and methods to carry out prevention and control work, so as to reduce the significant losses in grain production caused by insect disasters. The film "Soil and Water Conservation" explains the causes of soil erosion and drought and reduced production in the Loess Plateau area of ​​Northwest China, reflecting the scene of the Yellow River bringing more than 1.2 billion tons of sand and soil every year, causing floods downstream. It also summarizes the various effective methods of soil and water conservation created by the working people and scientific workers in the Northwest, giving people confidence and concrete methods to transform nature and green the Northwest. In terms of preventing diseases and improving people's health, there is the film "Safe Motherhood," which focuses on preventing puerperal fever and postpartum diseases (these two diseases used to take the lives of hundreds of thousands of mothers and infants in China every year), as well as the film "Painless Childbirth," which explains why childbirth used to be painful and why normal childbirth is not painful. In addition, there is the film "Home Electricity Safety," which explains the causes of electric shock, preventive measures, and how to provide first aid after electric shock, the film "Sports and Health," which explains the relationship between regular physical exercise and physical health, the film "Solar and Lunar Eclipses," which explains the natural phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses and breaks superstitious ideas, and the film "Zoo," which introduces the characteristics and habits of various animals in the Beijing Western Suburbs Park.
    These films can conduct materialist education to the audience, explain natural phenomena, disseminate production and life knowledge, and enable the audience to increase their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and cultivate people's love for science. Because these films are closely related to the masses' daily life and production, these films have been warmly welcomed by the past and part of the audience, helping to promote mass disaster resistance activities and spread advanced production methods.
    In addition, it should be mentioned that the existing films have overcome many technical difficulties and filmed some real natural scenes. For example, the real situation of locusts laying eggs was filmed in the "Eliminating Locusts" film, the real scene of the solar and lunar eclipses seen in China in 1953 was recorded in "Solar and Lunar Eclipses," the hatching of stem borer egg masses and the larvae drilling into rice stems were filmed in "Eradicating Rice Pests—Rice Stem Borers," and some animal habits were filmed in "Zoo." It is a great effort to be able to film these real scenes in China's current situation where special effects photography equipment is not perfect.
    Although the science education films produced now have achieved many successes, there are also some important shortcomings and problems that must be solved.
    First of all, the current science education films are still far from meeting the needs of the broad masses in terms of quality and quantity. More than ten films are produced every year, including industry, agriculture, health, astronomy, biology, and other aspects. The quantity and quality cannot meet the needs of the broad masses. At present, China's economic construction is being carried out on a large scale, and there is a lot of knowledge and advanced work experience in production technology that needs to be promoted. At the same time, with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, many agricultural technical problems are constantly being raised. The broad masses of the people demand to learn basic scientific common sense; and as an important tool for popularizing scientific knowledge, the power of film is weak and cannot keep up with the needs of the masses. The main difficulties here are the lack of good scripts and insufficient artistic creation cadres. At present, there are fewer than ten screenwriters in the film studio, and they have all been transferred from actors and feature film screenwriters and other units. Their original level of scientific knowledge is very poor and difficult to improve a lot in a short time. Therefore, the creation time of the script is generally more than half a year, and some are even more than a year. At present, the solution to this problem is to actively enrich the creative staff, and it is necessary to vigorously organize scripts from the scientific community and various business departments. Judging from the recent work of the film studio in organizing scripts, there are indeed many people from all aspects who are enthusiastic about the creation of science education film scripts. For example, the script on meteorological knowledge written by the person in charge of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory and the script on eye protection written by the person in charge of the Eye Hospital are quite rich and accurate in scientific content and expression methods. In the future, filmmakers must further cooperate with scientific workers and relevant business departments to solve the difficulties of lacking scripts. In addition, another important reason for the current insufficient number of science education films is the slow production speed and low labor productivity of the film studio. Last year, the average filming time for each film was more than half a year, and the preparation time and post-production time were very long. This year, the film studio plans to try to divide the filming stage to achieve planned production, strive to release films in a timely manner, and increase production.
    Secondly, judging from the existing science education films, there are still too few films with a high degree of materialist ideology, rich scientific content, high artistic expression ability, and suitable for the level of the general public and easy to understand. Many films do not explain natural phenomena and scientific principles clearly. Sometimes a lot of space is spent, but the principles are still not explained clearly, making people feel very vague in understanding this aspect of knowledge. It should be said that the vagueness that the audience feels when understanding is precisely because the author's (director's, etc.) understanding is vague and their research on scientific knowledge is insufficient. Some films have a messy structure and unclear levels, while the narration seems dry and tasteless, lacking the artistic appeal to attract people. Some films add branches and leaves, design some plots, and make the central content of the film very weak, adding some so-called "moving humanity" from the outside, giving people a feeling of unreal and unsimple, creating a certain degree of plot fiction. The "Decision on Strengthening Film Production Work" of the Government Administration Council points out that "Science education films should explain natural and social phenomena with a materialist world view, and at the same time publicize and promote various scientific and technological knowledge related to the daily life and production of the masses and suitable for the level of the general public." This is our guiding principle for creation and production. By checking the ideological and artistic nature of the films we produce, checking the role of science education films in promoting scientific knowledge, and whether they are suitable for the level of the general public, we are very insufficient and must constantly strive to improve the creative level of science education films.
    China's science education films cannot fully utilize existing film technology to exert the great power of this tool. As Comrade Fedorov, head of the Soviet Film Art Workers Delegation who came to China in 1952, pointed out: "The common shortcoming of Chinese popular science films is that they do not use various methods and techniques of scientific film photography." Of course, this is related to the current equipment conditions of the film studio, but even for the existing equipment, it is still underutilized, and it is not good at using various methods to use animation and models appropriately in the film. Improving technology in this area to meet the special requirements of science education films will be our long-term and important task.
    China's science education film industry has only just begun. In order to make this cause flourish, in addition to the efforts of science film workers, it also requires Chinese scientists and relevant business departments to cooperate and help more fully and closely, and be good at using film, this important tool, to spread scientific knowledge more widely among the masses.

    传播科学知识的有力工具
    ——谈科学教育电影的重要性及其在我国的状况
    科学教育电影制片厂厂长  洪林
    我国人民电影事业，在建立故事片、新闻记录片之后，又自一九五二年开始，建立了一种新的片种——科学教育影片。
    科学教育影片是电影事业中的一种重要形式。早在一九二○年，列宁就提倡这种影片，并认为这种影片应该具有“形象化的通俗演讲底性质”，他要求“更广泛地更有系统地利用电影进行生产宣传”。他曾写信给最高国民经济会议等机关，要“将新发明的泥煤水力开采法的工作情形用电影放映给许多党员群众看”。〔注一〕遵照列宁的指示，苏联科学工作者和电影工作者通过密切的合作，创造了许多优秀的苏联科学影片，它们已成为世界科学电影最先进最辉煌的榜样。近年来，苏联每年制作二百部左右的科学普及片与教学片，这些影片极广泛地宣传了苏联科学技术上的新成就，许多影片在艺术表现和技术上都达到极高的水平。如最近的“农业新闻”第九期，很清楚而细致地说明了种植马铃薯、洋白菜等作物的新方法——方形窝种法的极大优点，它可以使这些作物的培植工作实行机械化，这种新方法的推广，给集体农庄带来极大的好处，因为集体农民减轻了种植这种作物所费的劳动。“真理报”在评论中指出应该把这样好的影片送到每一集体农庄、国营农场和农业机器站，使所有农业工作者看到它。
    关于科学普及电影的重要作用，苏联科学院已故的院长科马诺夫曾写道：“我觉得，这个事业是目前最重要的事业之一。电影可以将科学知识介绍给最广大的人民群众，其他的方法绝不能保证科学知识可以这样广泛地传播。而且，看了这些影片，你就会看出，用别的方式很难说明的东西，在银幕上却可以解说得很清楚。书籍、图画、生动的语言和各种经验，都不能这样正确地、明白地而且引人入胜地表达事物，影片把这一切结合在一起。我还想说，科学普及片是艺术与科学结合的显著例子。”〔注二〕
    科学教育影片，可以成为科学研究工作的助手，把研究的对象和过程最真实而又最准确地记载在胶片上。苏联杰出的学者巴甫洛夫曾亲自领导过拍摄“大脑的构造”“神经系统”等影片。近代电影技术的进步，更大大地开辟了科学研究影片的范围，使得许多肉眼不能见到的现象，能用电影摄影机把它拍摄下来。
    科学教育影片又可以作为教学和技术训练的工具，它使教师们在黑板和挂图、模型之外，能利用小型的银幕，向学生进行各种课程的解说。优秀的苏联科学片“汽车司机教程”、“拖拉机教程”等，曾在苏联训练了成百万人学会开汽车和开拖拉机。苏联和东欧人民民主国家，都经常运用电影在高等、中等、初等和技术学校中来辅助教学。
    我国由于各种条件的限制，目前还未曾开始这一类研究片和教学片的制作（除拍摄很少数的先进技术传授的影片外）。我国的科学教育影片，是从与广大群众有密切联系的科学普及片开始的。这种影片是传播科学知识的有力工具。它向广大人民进行基本科学知识的教育，介绍我国在科学与技术上的重要成就，以唯物主义的观点解释自然现象和社会现象。
    自一九五二年五月，中央电影局建立科学教育影片的创作机构，这一年共拍摄了“消灭飞蝗”“郝建秀工作法”“先进砌砖法”等十三部影片。一九五三年二月科学教育电影制片厂正式成立，又陆续拍摄了“水土保持”“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”等九部影片。目前除了这一专门摄制科学教育电影的制片厂之外，中央卫生部所属北京、沈阳两个卫生教育电影的机构，曾摄制了“角膜移植”“和鼠疫作斗争”“消灭苍蝇”等若干部卫生教育影片；中央农业部所属农业电影社曾摄制“小麦选种”等几部农业教育影片。今年中央电影局科学教育电影制片厂已开始拍摄和准备拍摄的有“防治血吸虫病”“战胜厂房高温”“橡胶”“大豆根瘤菌”“淡水养鱼”等十五部影片和四本“科学与技术”的新闻片。从我国科学教育影片的摄制情况看，我国科学教育电影事业虽还处在草创时期，但它已有了一个良好的开端，影片开始和广大观众见面，并取得了他们的爱护。
    在推广工业部门先进经验和技术方面，曾拍摄了“郝建秀工作法”“先进砌砖法”“李锡奎调车法”等片，都能形象地解说这些先进工作法的基本精神，用新旧对比的手法，说明新方法的优越性。在农业方面，曾拍制了以消灭我国农业上两大主要害虫——飞蝗和三化螟为内容的影片“消灭飞蝗”“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”，将飞蝗、三化螟的生活史告诉观众，并说明扑灭这些害虫的方法，使人们有信心，有办法去进行防治工作，以减少虫灾所造成的粮食生产上的重大损失。影片“水土保持”则说明西北黄土区水土流失、旱荒减产的原因，反映出黄河上流每年带来十二万万吨以上的沙土，造成下流水灾的情景。又综合西北劳动人民和科学工作者所创造出来的保持水土的各项有效办法，给人以改造自然、绿化西北的信心和具体方法。在防止疾病增进人民健康方面，有以预防产褥热和四六风（这两项疾病过去每年曾夺去我国数十万产妇与婴儿的生命）为题材的影片“母子平安”，还有说明过去分娩为什么疼痛，正常分娩为什么不疼痛的影片“无痛分娩”。此外还有说明触电的原因、预防办法和触电后如何急救的影片“家庭用电安全”，有阐述经常进行体育锻炼与身体健康的关系的影片“体育与健康”，有解释日食与月食自然现象，打破迷信思想的影片“日食和月食”，有介绍北京西郊公园中各种动物特性、习惯的影片“动物园”。
    这些影片能向观众进行唯物主义教育，解释自然现象，传播生产和生活知识，观众看后能增进知识，扩展见闻，并能培养人们爱科学的美德。因为这些影片与群众的日常生活和生产有着密切的关系，所以这些影片过去和部分观众见面时，曾受到他们热烈的欢迎，帮助推动了群众性的抗灾害的活动，和传播了先进生产方法等。
    此外，应该提到，在现有的影片中，曾经克服了许多技术上的困难，拍摄了一些真实的自然景象的镜头。如在“消灭飞蝗”影片中拍摄了蝗虫下卵的真实情况，在“日食和月食”中纪录了一九五三年我国所见到的日月食真景，在“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”中拍了螟虫卵块孵化及幼虫钻稻茎，在“动物园”中拍了一些动物的习惯等，在我国目前特技摄影设备不完善的情况下，而能拍摄这些实景是经过很大努力的。
    现在制作的科学教育片虽然有了不少成绩，但也有一些重要的缺点和必须解决的问题。
    首先，目前科学教育片在质量上和数量上距离广大群众的需要还很远。每年制作十余部影片，包括工业、农业、卫生、天文、生物等各个方面，其数量和质量都是不能满足广大群众需要的。现在，我国经济建设正大规模地进行，需要推广的生产技术方面的知识和先进工作经验很多，同时随着农业合作化运动的发展，许多农业技术上的问题又不断地被提出来，广大群众要求学习基本科学常识；而作为普及科学知识重要工具的电影，力量是薄弱的，赶不上群众的需要。这其中主要的困难是缺乏好的剧本与艺术创作干部不足。目前制片厂的编剧人员不足十人，而又都是从演员和故事片的编剧等单位转来，科学知识水平原来很差，短时间内难以提高很多，因而剧本的创作时间，一般都在半年以上，有的且到一年以上。目前解决这一问题的办法，除积极充实创作人员外，就必须大力从科学界及各业务部门中组织剧本。根据制片厂最近组织剧本的工作看来，各方面热心于科学教育电影剧本创作的人确是很多的，如上海气象台负责人所写有关气象知识的剧本，眼科医院负责人所写有关保护眼睛的剧本，在科学内容及表现方法上都相当丰富准确，今后电影工作者必须更进一步与科学工作者和有关业务部门合作，以解决剧本缺少的困难。此外，造成目前科学教育片数量不足的另一重要原因，是制片厂制片速度过慢，劳动生产率低。去年平均每片摄制时间也都在半年以上，其中筹备时间及后期工作时间拖得很长，今年制片厂准备试行划分摄制阶段办法，做到有计划的生产，争取及时出片，增加产量。
    其次，从现有的科学教育片看来，具有高度的唯物主义思想，有丰富科学内容并有较高的艺术表现能力，又能适合于一般群众水平、通俗易懂的影片还太少。许多影片在解释自然现象和科学原理时，交代不清，有时篇幅花费不少，但原理还是没说明白，使人们在领会这一方面的知识上还很模糊。应该说，观众领会时所感到的这种模糊，恰是因为作者（编导等）的理解模糊，对科学知识钻研不够。一些影片结构凌乱，层次不明，而在解说词中则显得枯燥无味，缺少引人入胜的艺术感染力量。有的影片添枝加叶，设计一些情节，把影片的中心内容反弄得十分贫弱，从外加入一些所谓的“动人性”，给人以不真实不朴素之感，造成一定程度的情节虚构。政务院“关于加强电影制片工作的决定”中所指出的：“科学教育片应以唯物主义的世界观解释自然现象和社会现象，同时宣传和推广与群众日常生活和生产有关的，并适合一般群众水平的各种科学和技术知识”，是我们创作和制作的方针，以此检查我们制作的影片的思想性和艺术性，检查科学教育片推广科学知识上的作用，以及是否适合一般群众水平等方面，我们是很不够的，还须不断努力提高科学教育影片的创作水平。
    我国科学教育电影尚不能充分运用现有的电影技术，发挥电影这种工具的巨大力量。正如一九五二年来我国的苏联电影艺术工作者代表团团长费道罗夫同志所指出的：“中国科学普及影片的共同缺点，在于没有运用科学电影摄影的各种方法与手法。”当然，这与目前制片厂设备条件有关，但即是对于现有的设备，亦尚利用不足，不善于利用多种多样的方法把动画和模型在影片中用得恰到好处。改进这一方面的技术，以符合科学教育电影这一类影片的特殊要求，将是我们的长久的重要任务。
    我国的科学教育电影事业仅是才开始，要使这一事业获得蓬勃的发展，除了需要科学电影工作者的努力外，也还需要我国科学工作者和有关的业务部门更充分地、更密切地予以合作和帮助，善于运用电影这一重要工具，将科学知识更广泛地传播到群众当中去。〔注一〕所引列宁的话均见中央电影局艺术委员会编的“党论电影”一书。〔注二〕转引自中央电影局技术委员会出版的“科学教育电影”一书第八页。
