The Geneva Conference, which the people of the world eagerly hoped for, has begun. However, the US authorities' recent series of war cries, sabotage activities, and pressure on its allies France and Britain have intensified. Therefore, people all over the world have to ask: Is the US representative going to Geneva to seek peace or to expand the war?

The US representative to the Geneva Conference, US Secretary of State Dulles, issued a statement upon arriving in Geneva on the 24th, saying that he came to Geneva to carry out a "peace mission." But even in this statement, he was still trying to create an unpeaceful atmosphere and slander the People's Republic of China. What Dulles is actually doing and preparing to do is completely different. According to French newspapers, Dulles recently handed French Prime Minister Laniel and Foreign Minister Bidault a five-point plan formulated by the United States to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the war in Indochina. This plan requires French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Eden to withdraw from the Geneva Conference with Dulles on the fifteenth day of the conference and immediately begin negotiations to sign the Pacific Pact. At the same time, this plan stipulates that France should declare the three regimes in Indochina, now under the influence of the United States and France, to be "completely independent" according to the US's opinion, and sign a Pacific Pact with the participation of these three regimes. After the signing of the Pacific Pact, the signatory countries will immediately send troops to Indochina, commanded by Van Fleet. News from Paris proves that Dulles' activities in Paris in the past few days have been to force Bidault and Eden to act in accordance with the US's plan. Due to disagreements in the talks between the US, British, and French foreign ministers, Dulles' activities did not proceed very smoothly. Therefore, the US authorities are further putting pressure on their allies. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford hurriedly flew from Washington to Paris on the 23rd to "conduct important consultations" with French military authorities. Then, Washington released news on the 24th, saying: "The US Department of Defense has formulated a plan for direct intervention (in the Indochina War) for use," "If the (US) government believes that intervention is necessary, then General O'Daniel, the head of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina, may succeed General Navarre as commander-in-chief." The news also said that the US government will decide whether direct intervention in the Indochina War is appropriate and necessary based on the reports submitted by Dulles from Geneva and Radford from Paris. That is to say, Washington is using "direct intervention" to force France to continue the Indochina War, while in practice it is also stepping up preparations to "take over" the war.

The US authorities' intensified sabotage activities and adventurous policies on the eve of the Geneva Conference have aroused legitimate accusations from international public opinion. The British "Manchester Guardian" pointed out on the 20th: "Dulles does not seem to regard the Geneva Conference as an occasion to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Indochina issue, and other issues, but as an occasion to issue stern warnings to the communists." "From his best motives, he is unwilling to negotiate at the Geneva Conference." A message from Washington by a Kyodo News reporter on the 18th also confirmed: The series of war cries recently issued by US government leaders are preparatory steps for implementing a "tough policy" at the Geneva Conference. The message said: "The United States not only does not hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve concrete results, but instead believes that the conference is an opportunity to ensure the initiative of Cold War diplomacy." Indian Prime Minister Nehru once again solemnly pointed out on the 18th: Although the Geneva Conference "is about to begin discussing the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, war preparations are still continuing. The threat of using new destructive weapons and arbitrarily driving other countries is now present." He pointed out: "This is a strange way to hold negotiations."

The US war group's plan to organize the Pacific aggression group and expand the Indochina War has first aroused the angry condemnation of Asian countries. The "Hindustan Times" pointed out: This "new measure attempting to split Asian countries and provoke greater disputes has seriously endangered peace in Asia." India's "Statesman" said: This is "a new and terrible interference in Asian affairs." India's "Free Press" also pointed out: "This is a challenge to the independence and self-esteem of the Asian people." Myanmar's "Rangoon Daily" wrote that the US's purpose "is to rehearse a new drama according to the Korean War," and due to the US's actions, "Myanmar has been seriously threatened." The "Indonesia News" believes that this is another act of "playing with fire" by the United States, and the newspaper said: Once the Indochina War expands, "the entire Southeast Asia will be directly harmed." The "Ceylon Observer" said: This is "another example of the arrogant diplomatic policy of the US State Department, which, due to its traditional clumsiness, has instead increased suspicion of US territorial ambitions."

The US ruling group's conspiracy to seize France's position in Indochina by expanding its intervention in the Indochina War is arousing increasing suspicion in France. The French "Combat" pointed out in its commentary on the US's plan to organize the Pacific Pact: "For France, this plan is dangerous. This plan may become one of the methods used by the United States to attract some countries that France hopes to keep within the French Federation into the US sphere of influence." "Liberation" also pointed out: "The Pacific Pact will help make Indochina a 'battlefield' under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Pact Organization presided over by the Americans." A Reuters dispatch from Paris stated more clearly: Many right-wing members of the French parliament are "worried that after the United States steps into Indochina, France's last remaining rights there will also be lost." British public opinion is also extremely dissatisfied with the US's attempt to drag Britain into the war once again. The "Daily Herald" said: If Western countries do not insist on implementing a policy of peaceful resolution at the Geneva Conference, it will "cause great anger among the people in Britain. Because what Britain least wants is to expand the Indochina War and involve British troops in it. Britain's vested interest in Indochina is only peace."

US Vice President Nixon's call to send US troops to directly intervene in the Indochina War has also caused panic and unease among some people within the US ruling group. UPI said: This is "because people still have fresh memories of the long list of casualties and the unpopular Korean War." AP reported: McCormick, editor and publisher of the "Chicago Tribune," said: "Nixon's suggestion is close to madness. He talks like a rambling idiot." He said: "No matter what happens, we should not get involved in Indochina." At the same time, Gannett, the publisher of 22 newspapers in New York State and three other states, also warned: "If we get caught in the vortex there (Indochina), it will be worse than Korea."

The US authorities' policy of obstructing the Geneva Conference and expanding the Indochina War is very unpopular. Therefore, Dulles had to verbally express that he came to Geneva to carry out a so-called "peace mission." But is the US authority seeking peace or expanding the war? The world is closely watching Dulles' and the US military and political leaders' future actions.

### 美国是谋求和平，还是扩大战争？

    美国是谋求和平，还是扩大战争？
    新华社评论员　江南
    全世界人民热切希望的日内瓦会议已经开始举行了。但是，美国当局近来所进行的一系列的战争叫嚣、破坏活动以及对它的盟国法国和英国所加的压力，反而更为加紧。因此，全世界人民都要问：美国代表到日内瓦去，究竟是为了谋求和平，还是扩大战争？
    出席日内瓦会议的美国代表、美国国务卿杜勒斯，在二十四日到达日内瓦时发表声明说，他到日内瓦是为了执行“和平使命”。但是就在这个声明中他还在努力制造不和平的气氛，并诬蔑中华人民共和国。杜勒斯实际上正在做的和准备做的，却完全是另一回事。据法国报纸报道，杜勒斯最近曾将美国制定的破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的一个五点计划交给法国总理拉尼埃和外长皮杜尔。这个计划要求法国外长皮杜尔、英国外长艾登在会议第十五天跟着杜勒斯一起退出日内瓦会议，立即进行筹备签订太平洋公约的谈判。同时，这个计划规定法国要按照美国的意见宣布现在美国和法国势力之下的印度支那三个政权“完全独立”，并签订一个有这三个政权参加的太平洋公约。太平洋公约签订之后，缔约国马上就派军队到印度支那，由范佛里特担任统帅。巴黎的消息证明，过去几天中杜勒斯在巴黎进行的活动，正是要迫使皮杜尔和艾登按照美国的这个计划行事。由于在美英法三国外长的会谈中产生了分歧，杜勒斯的活动进行得并不十分顺利。因此，美国当局正在对它的盟国进一步施加压力。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福已在二十三日从华盛顿匆匆飞往巴黎，要和法国军事当局“进行重要的商谈”。接着，华盛顿在二十四日又放出消息说：“美国国防部已经制订了直接干涉
  （印度支那战争）的计划以备使用”，“如果（美国）政府认为干涉是必要的话，那么，美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔将军，就可能继纳瓦尔将军担任总司令。”消息并说，美国政府将根据杜勒斯从日内瓦和雷德福从巴黎提出的报告，决定直接干涉印度支那战争是否适当和必要。这就是说，华盛顿正在用“直接干涉”来使法国把印度支那战争打下去，同时在实际上也在加紧进行“接管”这个战争的准备。
    美国当局在日内瓦会议前夕加紧进行的破坏活动和冒险政策，引起了国际舆论的正当指责。英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”在二十日指出：“杜勒斯似乎并不把日内瓦会议看作是一个寻求朝鲜问题、印度支那问题及其他问题的和平解决的场合，而把它看作是一个向共产党发表严厉警告的场合。”“从他最好的动机出发，他是不愿意在日内瓦会议上进行谈判的。”日本共同社记者十八日从华盛顿发出的消息也证实：美国政府首脑最近发出的一系列战争叫嚣，就是要在日内瓦会议上执行“强硬政策”的准备步骤。这个消息说：“美国不仅不希望日内瓦会议取得具体的成果，并且反而认为会议是一个确保冷战外交主动权的机会。”印度总理尼赫鲁在十八日再一次严正地指出：虽然日内瓦会议“就要开始讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，但是战争准备工作却仍在继续进行。使用新的毁灭性武器和随意驱使其他国家的威胁现在是存在的。”他指出：“这是一种奇怪的举行谈判的方式。”
    美国好战集团企图组织太平洋侵略集团、扩大印度支那战争的计划，首先引起了亚洲国家的愤怒谴责。“印度斯坦时报”指出：这种“企图分裂亚洲国家和挑拨更大纠纷的新措施，已使亚洲的和平遭到严重的危险。”印度的“政治家报”说：这是“对亚洲事务的新的可怕的干涉”。印度的“自由新闻”也指出：“这是对亚洲人民的独立和自尊的一种挑战。”缅甸的“仰光日报”写道：美国的目的“是想按照朝鲜战争来排演一幕新剧”，由于美国的行动，“缅甸已受到了严重的威胁”。“印尼新闻报”认为：这是美国又一次的“玩火”行为，该报并说：印度支那战争一旦扩大，“整个东南亚都将直接受到危害”。“锡兰观察家”报说：这是“美国国务院的蛮横外交政策的另一个例子，这种政策由于它传统的笨拙，反而增加了对美国有领土野心的怀疑。”
    美国统治集团企图通过扩大干涉印度支那战争来夺取法国在印度支那的地位的阴谋，正引起法国越来越大的疑惧。法国“战斗报”在评论美国要组织太平洋公约时指出：“对于法国来说，这种计划是有危险的。这种计划可能成为美国试图把法国希望使其留在法国联邦内的一些国家吸引到美国势力范围所用的方法之一。”“解放报”也指出：“太平洋公约将有助于使印度支那成为在美国人主持之下的太平洋公约组织管辖之下的一个‘战场’。”路透社从巴黎发出的一条消息更明白地说：法国许多右翼议员都“担心美国踏进印度支那之后，将使法国在那里的最后一些权利也将丧失”。英国舆论对于美国企图将英国再一次拖入战争，也表示极为不满。“每日先驱报”说：如果西方国家在日内瓦会议上不坚持执行和平解决的政策的话，在英国“也将会引起人们的极大愤怒。因为英国最不希望的是扩大印度支那战争而把英军卷入其中。英国在印度支那的切身利益只是和平。”
    美国副总统尼克松发出的要派遣美国军队直接干涉印度支那战争的叫嚣，在美国统治集团内部有一些人们中间，也引起了恐慌不安。合众社说：这是“因为人们对长串的伤亡名单和不得人心的朝鲜战争还是记忆犹新的。”美联社报道：“芝加哥论坛报”的编辑兼发行人麦考米克说：“尼克松的建议近乎疯狂。他的谈法就像是一个胡说八道的白痴。”他说：“不管发生什么事，我们都不应该插身于印度支那。”同时，美国纽约州及其他三个州的二十二家报纸的发行人甘内特也警告说：“如果我们卷入那里（印度支那）的漩涡，那会比朝鲜更糟糕。”
    美国当局所执行的阻挠日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的政策，是十分不得人心的。因此，杜勒斯口头上也不得不表示他到日内瓦是要执行所谓
  “和平使命”。但是，美国当局究竟是谋求和平呢，还是要扩大战争？全世界都在密切注视着杜勒斯和美国军政首脑们今后的实际行动。
