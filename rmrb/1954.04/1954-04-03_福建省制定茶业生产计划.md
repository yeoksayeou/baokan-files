Fujian Province Formulates Tea Production Plan

    The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture, based on the current needs of national economic construction and the rising living standards of the people, as well as the actual situation of tea production in the province, has formulated a tea production plan for 1954. The province requires the production of 100,500 dan of raw tea in 1954, the opening up of 55,000 mu of tea gardens, the rejuvenation of 15,000 mu of old tea trees by pruning, and the mobilization of tea farmers to use layering and cutting methods to propagate 12 million excellent tea tree varieties. Select 3,000 dan of seeds from excellent mother plants for promotion and planting. In addition, in order to gradually improve the quality of tea in the province, this year's plan focuses on continuing to promote 380 tea rolling machines and 2,000 baking cages.
    In order to complete the above tasks, the people's governments at all levels in key tea-producing areas, in addition to helping tea farmers solve problems such as production materials and production funds in a timely manner, will also vigorously promote the general line of the transition period and the current tea production policy through tea farmer representative meetings, tea farmer symposiums, tea industry technical personnel training courses, etc., during the tea production season. Exchange production experiences, extensively mobilize the masses to open up tea gardens, improve technology, and increase tea production and quality.
    Secondly, actively and steadily carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement combining agriculture and tea. In the past two or three years, there have been nearly 8,000 mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Fujian Province in four forms: joint sales groups, joint tea making groups, agricultural and tea-combined mutual aid groups, and agricultural and tea production cooperatives. These mutual aid and cooperative organizations have played a significant role in resolving the contradictions between time and labor in current agricultural and tea production, improving cultivation and preliminary processing techniques, increasing the yield and quality of raw tea, saving manpower and material resources required for tea picking, tea making, and tea sales, and facilitating procurement work. This year, under the unified leadership and deployment of the local party committees, all tea-producing areas will further improve this work. In order to promote the development and improvement of the agricultural and tea-combined mutual aid and cooperation movement, governments at all levels and tea production guidance stations must give active support to mutual aid groups and cooperatives, and rely on them to inspire and unite the vast number of tea farmers to develop tea production.

    福建省制定茶业生产计划
    福建省农业厅根据国家当前经济建设和人民生活水平日益提高的需要，以及该省茶业生产的实际情况，制定了一九五四年的茶业生产计划。全省要求一九五四年生产毛茶十万零五千市担，垦辟茶园五万五千市亩，台刈衰老茶树一万五千市亩，发动茶农采用压条、扦插方法繁殖优良茶树品种一千二百万株，选择优良母株采种三千市担，以供推广种植；此外，为逐步改良本省茶叶品质，今年计划重点地继续推广揉茶机三百八十架、焙笼两千个。
    为了完成上述任务，重点茶区各级人民政府除帮助茶农及时解决生产资料与生产资金等问题外，在茶叶生产季节里，并将通过茶农代表会、茶农座谈会、茶业技术人员训练班等等方式，大力宣传过渡时期总路线和当前茶业生产的方针政策，交流生产经验，广泛发动群众垦辟茶园、改进技术、提高茶叶产量和品质。
    其次，积极稳步地开展农茶结合的互助合作运动。近两三年来，福建省已有合伙送售组、联合制茶组、农茶结合互助组与农茶业生产合作社四种形式的互助合作组织近八千个；这些互助合作组织，在解决当前农业与茶业生产的时间与人力的矛盾，改进栽培与初制技术提高毛茶产量与品质，节省采茶、制茶、售茶所需人力物力，便利收购工作等方面都起了很大作用。今年各茶区在当地党委统一领导和布置下，将进一步做好这一工作。为促进农茶结合互助合作运动的发展和提高，各级政府和茶业生产指导所、站，均须给互助组与合作社以积极的支持，并依靠他们来鼓舞和团结广大茶农，发展茶业生产。
