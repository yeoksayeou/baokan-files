    Guangdong Province Achieves Bumper Harvest of Over Two Million Mu of Winter Wheat
    Farmers in Guangdong and Guangxi Begin Selling New Wheat to the State
    [By this paper] Guangdong Province farmers planted 2.1 million mu of wheat last winter, and a widespread bumper harvest has now been achieved, with the provincial average increasing by 10% compared to last year.
    The area sown with wheat in Guangdong Province last winter increased by 300,000 mu compared to the winter of 1952. Many areas that had not previously grown wheat or had grown very little wheat planted wheat or expanded the area sown with wheat last winter, and most achieved a bumper harvest. For example, in 1952, Shixing County only planted 34 mu of wheat, but last winter it expanded to more than 1,600 mu. In Nanhai County, the wheat that was experimentally planted last winter generally yielded 150 jin per mu, with the best reaching 200 jin. In Daqiao Township, Deqing County, the average yield was 250 jin per mu. Farmer Xian A'yong plowed the soil in advance when planting wheat last winter, allowing the soil to fully weather, then prepared the land and sowed the seeds, and applied fertilizer in stages, yielding 700 jin of clean, dry wheat from 1.9 mu of land. Farmers in Longchuan County paid close attention to the management of wheat fields. For example, farmers in Gaoling Township, Tenth District, generally applied fertilizer three to four times during the wheat's growth process, with an average yield of about 100 jin per mu, an increase of about 10% compared to last year.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 4th] Farmers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have begun selling the wheat they harvested this year to the state. In mid-March, the amount of new wheat purchased by state grain departments in Guangdong Province reached more than 7 million jin, an increase of more than double the total amount of wheat purchased in March last year. In late March, the amount of wheat entering the market increased again compared to mid-March. In Meixian, Yue Dong District, the amount entering the market in late March doubled compared to mid-March. The Meixian State Grain Company is now purchasing about 200,000 jin of new wheat every day. State grain departments in various parts of Guangxi Province also began purchasing new wheat around mid-March.
    Although farmers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces lacked the habit and techniques of planting winter wheat in the past, thanks to the assistance provided by the People's Government, the wheat planted in many places can achieve a bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that the average yield of wheat per mu in various counties of Yue Bei District will increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The wheat harvest in Pingnan, Yulin and other counties in Guangxi Province is also better than last year. After selling the new wheat, farmers are actively purchasing the means of production needed for spring plowing and summer daily necessities.

    广东省二百多万亩冬小麦丰收
    广东广西农民开始把新麦卖给国家
    【本报讯】广东省农民去年冬季种植了二百一十万亩小麦，现在普遍得到丰收，全省平均比去年增产一成。
    广东省去冬种麦面积，比一九五二年冬季扩大了三十万亩。很多过去没有种过麦或种麦很少的地区，去冬都种了麦或扩大了种麦面积，并且大部获得丰收。如始兴县一九五二年只种麦三十四亩，去冬扩大了一千六百多亩。南海县去冬试种的小麦，每亩一般都有一百五十斤产量，好的达二百斤。德庆县大桥乡每亩平均收成二百五十斤，农民冼阿咏去冬种麦时提前犁土，使土壤充分风化，然后整地播种，分次施肥，一亩九分田收得净干麦七百市斤。龙川县农民很注意管理麦田，如第十区高岭乡的农民在小麦生长过程中，普遍施肥三次到四次，每亩产量一般有一百斤左右，约比去年增产百分之十。
    【新华社武汉四日电】广东和广西两省的农民已开始把今年收获的小麦卖给国家。三月中旬广东省国家粮食部门收购的新麦达七百多万斤，比去年三月份全月的小麦收购量增加一倍以上。三月下旬小麦的上市量比中旬又增加了。粤东区梅县三月下旬比中旬的上市量增加一倍，现梅县国家粮食公司每日收购的新麦达二十万斤左右。广西省各地国家粮食部门三月中旬前后也都开始收购新麦。
    广东、广西两省农民过去虽缺乏种植冬小麦的习惯和技术，但由于人民政府给予扶助，许多地方种植的小麦今年都可获得丰收。粤北区各县估计今年小麦平均每亩可比去年增产一成到两成。广西省平南、郁林等县小麦的收成也都比去年好。农民们卖出新麦后，正纷纷购买春耕生产需要的生产资料和夏季日用品。
