    Damage to Indonesia from the U.S. "Embargo" Policy
    Zhang Yan
    The U.S. ruling clique's attempt to continue forcing countries to implement the so-called "embargo" policy is being met with increasingly strong opposition from various countries. International opinion believes that developing trade relations between countries not only conforms to the interests of the countries engaged in trade, but also helps to ease international tensions.
    The U.S. "embargo" policy has caused serious damage to Asian countries. Indonesia is one of the countries that has suffered deeply. Recently, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said at the Indonesian Journalists Association: "We have suffered too deeply because of 'adhering to the UN embargo on strategic materials'."
    Indonesia is an agricultural country. Its economic life mainly relies on the production and export of important raw materials such as rubber and tin. Rubber, in particular, is the source of 52% of Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings. Rubber production directly affects the lives of 10% of Indonesia's total population.
    Before World War II, Indonesia's annual rubber production was about 500,000 tons, accounting for 30% of the world's total production; after the war, production increased even more, reaching 800,000 tons in 1951, accounting for about half of the world's total production. In rubber exports, exports in 1950 accounted for 43.4% of the total export value; in 1951, it increased to 50.08%. The increase in rubber exports once turned Indonesia's foreign trade from a deficit to a surplus. However, since being forced by the United States to implement the "embargo," due to the United States manipulating the rubber market and continuously lowering prices, Indonesia's rubber exports began to shrink, and the income from selling rubber also decreased sharply. According to Indonesian official statistics, Indonesia's rubber exports decreased from 633,000 tons from January to October 1952 to more than 586,000 tons in the same period of 1953, and the total export value decreased from 3.999 billion rupiah to 2.692 billion rupiah. This means that Indonesia's rubber exports from January to October last year decreased by 7.4% compared with the same period in 1952, and income decreased by about 32.7%. What is particularly serious is that because more than 70% of Indonesia's rubber production belongs to small-scale private rubber plantations, the damage suffered by the Indonesian people is particularly significant. According to Agence France-Presse's report on November 4, 1953, as a result of the "embargo," 100,000 tons of Indonesian private rubber could not be sold in 1952.
    The damage brought to Indonesia by the U.S. "embargo" policy is not only the shrinking of Indonesia's rubber exports, but also facilitates the plundering of Indonesia by U.S. monopoly capitalists by means of lowering rubber prices. According to statistics from the West Java rubber industry in July last year, before the implementation of the "embargo," the price of Indonesian rubber was about 11 rupiah per kilogram, while after the "embargo," the price in the United States fell to less than 3.5 rupiah (the production cost is about 4 rupiah per kilogram). As a result of such price cuts, Indonesia lost about 2 billion rupiah in foreign exchange in the first quarter of 1953 alone. The heavy blow to Indonesia's economy can be imagined.
    Indonesia has also suffered the same serious damage from the "embargo" in tin production. Before World War II, Indonesia's tin production was second only to Malaya, accounting for about 17% of the world's total production. The output in 1952 reached 36,000 tons, ranking second in the capitalist world. Before the implementation of the "embargo," Indonesia's tin exports were also a major source of foreign exchange income; but after the "embargo," especially after the United States stockpiled a large amount of tin, continuously lowered tin prices, and stopped buying Indonesian tin, Indonesia's tin exports and sales revenue deteriorated.
    In addition, under the manipulation of the United States, the International Sugar Conference last year even passed an absurd resolution, limiting Indonesia's sugar exports to a maximum of 250,000 tons per year. According to this absurd decision, more than 50% of Indonesia's annual sugar production will not be able to be exported. Indonesia's quinine, fiber, and resin and other raw materials have also been greatly affected by the "embargo." According to a report by the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, the total export value in 1953 was significantly lower than in 1952. Since the "embargo," Indonesia's losses in major exports such as rubber, tin, and sugar alone have reached 1 billion U.S. dollars.
    On the one hand, the United States uses "embargoes" and price cuts to打击Indonesia's exports and plunder Indonesia's raw materials, on the other hand, it uses so-called "aid" to dump surplus goods into Indonesia, making U.S. and Japanese goods flood the Indonesian market, seriously打击Indonesia's national industry, and increasing Indonesia's huge trade deficit.
    Under the打击of the U.S. "embargo" policy, Indonesia's foreign trade deficit has been expanding year by year. According to a report by the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, Indonesia's foreign trade deficit reached 1.0016 billion rupiah from January to November 1953. The huge foreign trade deficit has increased Indonesia's budget deficit, causing serious inflation. Last year, although the Indonesian government had taken various measures to increase national income, it still could not exceed 7.6 billion rupiah, while expenditures reached 9.4 billion rupiah.
    The "embargo" policy directly and seriously affects the lives of the Indonesian people. Hundreds of thousands of small rubber producers are bankrupt. The number of unemployed is increasing at an alarming rate. According to statistics from the Indonesian Central Employment Agency, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed in Indonesia has reached 15 million, accounting for about 20% of the country's population; among them, more than 70,000 workers are unemployed due to the rubber industry crisis.
    The Indonesian people have no obligation to endure such heavy damage for the benefit of U.S. monopoly capitalists. The voices of people from all walks of life in Indonesia opposing the U.S. "blockade" and "embargo" policy are rising. Indonesian bourgeois newspapers are also increasingly frequently revealing the dissatisfaction of Indonesian business and industry, such as the "Kompas" which said: "We cannot agree that the United States uses 16 million U.S. dollars in aid to make us lose the markets of Eastern Europe, New China, and Russia, and lose 300 million U.S. dollars a year." The "Sumber" also loudly called: "For the benefit of our country, the government should continue to work hard to find ways to break through the U.S. 'embargo'."
    The Indonesian government sent an economic delegation to conduct trade negotiations with our country, and signed a trade agreement on November 30 last year. The signing of this agreement will help develop normal trade between Indonesia and China on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. National public opinion in Indonesia unanimously believes that trade between the two countries is conducive to the restoration and development of Indonesia's national industry and commerce and the entire economy.

    美国“禁运”政策对印度尼西亚的损害
    张演
    美国统治集团企图继续强迫各国奉行所谓“禁运”政策，正遭到各国日益强烈的反对。各国舆论认为发展各国之间的贸易关系，不但符合进行贸易各国的利益，而且有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    美国的“禁运”政策已经给亚洲国家造成严重的损害。印度尼西亚就是其中受害深重的一个国家。最近印尼总理阿利·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在印尼记者协会上说：由于“遵守了联合国关于战略物资的禁运，我们所受的痛苦实在太深了。”
    印尼是个农业国家。它的经济生活主要依靠出产和输出橡胶和锡等重要原料。特别是橡胶，它是印尼百分之五十二的外汇收入的来源。橡胶生产直接影响着占印尼全国百分之十的人口的生活。
    第二次世界大战前，印尼橡胶每年产量约五十万吨，占世界总产量的百分之三十；战后产量更有增加，一九五一年为八十万吨，约占世界总产量的一半。在橡胶的输出中，一九五○年的输出占全部输出总值的百分之四十三点四；一九五一年增至百分之五十点零八。由于橡胶输出增加，曾使印尼的对外贸易从入超转为出超。但是自被美国强迫实行“禁运”以后，由于美国操纵橡胶市场，不断压低价格，印尼橡胶输出开始萎缩，而出售橡胶的收入也随之大减。据印尼官方的统计数字：印尼橡胶输出从一九五二年一月至十月的六十三万三千吨减少到一九五三年同期间的五十八万六千多吨，而输出总值由三十九亿九千九百万盾减为二十六亿九千二百万盾。这就是说，印尼橡胶去年一月到十月的输出量比一九五二年同期间减少了百分之七点四，收入减少了约百分之三十二点七。尤其严重的是，因为印尼橡胶生产百分之七十以上属于规模较小的民间橡胶园，所以印尼人民所受的损害也就特别重大。据法新社一九五三年十一月四日报道，由于“禁运”的结果，一九五二年的印尼民间橡胶有十万吨无法卖出。
    美国“禁运”政策带给印尼的损害，不仅仅是造成印尼橡胶输出的萎缩，而且便利了美国垄断资本家用压低橡胶价格的手段来掠夺印尼。据西爪哇橡胶业去年七月间的统计，实施“禁运”前，印尼橡胶价格每公斤约值十一盾，而“禁运”后在美国的压价下跌至三盾半以下（生产成本每公斤约四盾）。这样的压价的结果，仅仅在一九五三年第一季度里，已使印尼损失了约合二十亿盾的外汇。印尼在经济上受到的沉重打击是可以想见的。
    印尼在锡的生产方面也蒙受到“禁运”的同样严重的损害。第二次世界大战前，印尼锡的产量仅次于马来亚，约占世界总产量的百分之十七。一九五二年的产量共达三万六千吨，占资本主义世界的第二位。实行“禁运”前，印尼锡的输出也是主要的外汇收入来源之一；但在“禁运”后，特别是在美国大量囤储了锡、不断压低锡价、并停止购买印尼的锡以后，使印尼的锡的输出和售价收入每况愈下。
    此外在美国的操纵之下，去年国际糖业会议竟然通过了荒谬的决议，限制印尼糖的输出量每年最多不得超过二十五万吨。按照这种荒谬的决定，印尼每年生产的糖将有百分之五十以上无法输出。印尼的奎宁、纤维和树脂等原料也受到“禁运”的巨大影响。据印尼中央统计局的报告，一九五三年的输出总值均较一九五二年显著降低。自从“禁运”以来，仅仅在橡胶、锡、糖等主要输出方面，印尼的损失便已达十亿美元。
    美国一方面以“禁运”和压价来打击印尼的输出和掠夺印尼的原料，另一方面又利用所谓“援助”来对印尼大量倾销剩余商品，使美、日货物充斥印尼市场，严重地打击了印尼的民族工业，增大了印尼对外贸易的巨大逆差。
    在美国“禁运”政策的打击下，印尼对外贸易逆差年见扩大。据印尼中央统计局的报告：印尼对外贸易逆差在一九五三年一月到十一月，就达到十亿零一百六十万盾。对外贸易的巨大逆差，使得印尼的预算赤字增加，造成严重的通货膨胀。在去年，印尼政府虽然曾经采取了各种措施以增加国家收入，但仍无法超过七十六亿盾，而支出则达九十四亿盾。
    “禁运”政策直接严重地影响到印尼人民的生活。成千上万的橡胶小生产者陷于破产。失业人数以惊人的速度增加。据印尼中央职业介绍局的统计，印尼全国失业和半失业人数已达一千五百万人，约占全国人口的百分之二十；其中因橡胶业危机而失业的工人便有七万多人。
    印尼人民是没有义务来为美国垄断资本家的利益而使自己忍受这样惨重的损害的。印尼各阶层人民反对美国“封锁”“禁运”政策的呼声正在日益高涨。印尼资产阶级的报纸也日益频繁地流露出印尼工商界人士的不满情绪，如“指南针报”就这样说过：“我们不能赞成美国以一千六百万美元的援助，使我们因此丧失了东欧、新中国和俄国的市场，并因此每年损失三亿美元。”“泉源报”也大声疾呼：“为了我们国家的利益，政府应该继续努力从事找寻突破美国‘禁运’的途径。”
    印尼政府派遣了经济代表团与我国进行贸易谈判，并于去年十一月三十日签订了贸易协定。这一个协定的签订，将有助于发展印尼与中国间的平等互利的正常贸易。印尼全国舆论都一致认为两国的贸易有利于印尼民族工商业和整个经济的恢复和发展。
