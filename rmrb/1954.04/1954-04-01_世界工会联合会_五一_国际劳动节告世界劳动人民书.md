    World Federation of Trade Unions
    “May Day” International Labor Day Letter to the Working People of the World
    Dear Comrades: The 1954 “May Day” International Labor Day is approaching, and the World Federation of Trade Unions extends brotherly greetings to you, to the comrades in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries who are engaged in fierce struggles to protect and fight for their legitimate rights, and to the comrades in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all People's Democratic countries (whose great achievements are consolidating peace and consolidating the belief of the world's working people in the final victory over the exploiters).
    In the capitalist and colonial world, your living conditions have worsened in the past year. Monopoly capitalists pursuing profits have intensified their ruthless exploitation. Poverty, lack of confidence in the future, and unemployment are increasing. Initial signs of a new crisis have emerged in the United States. Economic depression has occurred in many capitalist countries. In the past year, the struggle of the working people to satisfy their social and economic demands has become increasingly offensive. The working people are increasingly strengthening the unity of their actions.
    Men and women workers: Trade unions are the organized force and necessary weapon for improving living conditions, for democracy, national independence, and peace. For your struggle for bread, labor, and a better life to succeed, you must protect and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms. Reactionaries are using the most brutal means to destroy this weapon and seize your rights. The World Federation of Trade Unions deeply sympathizes with the thousands of victims persecuted by the police. The World Federation of Trade Unions pays tribute to the countless glorious fighters who have dedicated their lives to the great cause of the working class.
    The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions adopted a resolution to launch a broad international movement to protect and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms on May 1, 1954. Workers of different political views and belonging to different trade unions: actively participate in the preparation and celebration of "May Day" International Labor Day. We will hold powerful demonstrations on May 1, 1954, showing our unity in striving for a better life, for protecting trade union rights, and for fighting for peace.
    Comrades: The threat of war has not yet been stopped. American imperialists are leading the forces of war and reactionaries, continuing to plot aggression plans. The establishment of the so-called "European Defense Community" and the remilitarization of West Germany ruled by revanchist forces are obstacles to easing international tensions.
    The tenacious actions of the people of all countries have achieved such great achievements as: the Korean armistice, the convening of the Berlin Conference, and the agreement on negotiations for disarmament, and the agreement on holding the Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina. Only through you, through your united action, and through your vigilance, can the plans of the arms dealers be shattered.
    Comrades: Forward! Strive to increase your wages; strive to improve living standards and defend your labor rights; strive for and maintain social insurance. Forward! Defend and fight for trade union freedom and democratic freedoms to block the path of reactionaries and fascism. Demand the abolition of anti-worker and anti-trade union laws, and demand the release of all suppressed worker activists.
    Workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries: Build a broad united front against colonial oppression, defend your rights and your freedom, fight for your national independence, and strive to end colonial enslavement.
    Men and women workers of European countries! Unite! Fight against the ratification of military agreements and prevent the implementation of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty.
    Men and women workers of all countries: Expand and strengthen the unity of action, which is the guarantee of your victory. Strive to restore the unity of international trade unions, and expose those who oppose your unity.
    Comrades: Forward! For a happy life, freedom, peace, and national independence.
    Long live the unity and solidarity of the working people of the world!
    Long live peace!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Long live the festival of international solidarity of the working people, the festival of unity, friendship, and struggle of the working people of the world - the 1954 "May Day" International Labor Day!
                          World Federation of Trade Unions
          Vienna, March 28, 1954

    世界工会联合会
    “五一”国际劳动节告世界劳动人民书
    亲爱的同志们：一九五四年“五一”国际劳动节即将到来，世界工会联合会谨向你们，向在资本主义国家、殖民地和半殖民地国家为保护和争取合法权利而进行激烈斗争的同志们，向苏联、中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家（它们的伟大成就巩固着和平和巩固着世界劳动人民最后战胜剥削者的信念）的同志们，致以兄弟般的敬礼。
    在资本主义和殖民地的世界中，你们的生活条件在最近一年中是更加恶化了。追求利润的垄断资本家加强了残酷的剥削。贫穷、对未来没有信心和失业的情况不断增加着。新危机的初步征兆已在美国显现出来。许多资本主义国家发生经济萧条的现象。在最近一年中，劳动人民为满足自己的社会和经济要求而进行的斗争，越来越具有进攻的性质。劳动人民日益加强他们行动的一致。
    男女劳动者：工会是为改善生活条件、为民主、国家独立与和平而斗争的组织力量和必要武器。你们为面包、劳动和美好的生活而进行的斗争要获得成功，就必须保护和争取工会权利与民主自由。反动派采取最残酷的手段，企图摧毁这种武器和夺取你们的权利。世界工会联合会深为同情数以千计的为警察所迫害的牺牲者。世界工会联合会谨向那些为工人阶级的伟大事业而献出生命的无数光荣战士致敬。
    世界工会第三次代表大会通过一项决议，决定在一九五四年五月一日展开保护和争取工会权利和民主自由的广泛的国际运动。各种不同政见和属于不同工会的劳动者：积极参加准备和庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。我们要在一九五四年五月一日举行强大的示威，显示我们一致为美好的生活、为保护工会权利和争取和平而奋斗。
    同志们：战争的威胁还远没有制止。美国帝国主义者领导着战争力量和反动派，继续策划侵略计划。所谓“欧洲防务集团”的建立和复仇主义力量统治的西德的军国主义化，便是缓和国际紧张局势的障碍。
    各国人民顽强不屈的行动取得了这样巨大的成就，如：朝鲜停战、柏林会议的召开和就进行裁减军备的谈判、就召开日内瓦会议以和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题达成协议。只有靠你们、靠你们的一致行动、靠你们的警惕性，才能粉碎军火商的计划。
    同志们：前进！争取提高你们的工资；争取提高生活水平和保卫你们的劳动权利；争取与维护社会保险。前进！保卫与争取工会自由、民主自由，以堵塞反动派与法西斯主义的道路。要求取消反工人与反工会的法律，要求释放所有被镇压的工人积极分子。
    殖民地与半殖民地国家的劳动者们：建立起广泛阵线，反对殖民压迫，保卫你们的权利和你们的自由，争取你们民族的独立，争取结束殖民地的奴役地位。
    欧洲各国的男女劳动者们！联合起来！为反对批准军事协定而斗争，阻止波恩条约和巴黎条约的实行。
    各国的男女劳动者们：扩大和加强行动的一致，这是你们的胜利的保证。争取恢复国际工会的统一，揭露那些反对你们的统一的人。
    同志们：前进！为了幸福的生活、自由、和平与民族独立。
    全世界劳动人民的统一与团结万岁！
    和平万岁！
    世界工会联合会万岁！
    劳动人民国际大团结的节日、全世界劳动人民统一、友谊与斗争的节日——一九五四年的“五一”国际劳动节万岁！　世界工会联合会
          一九五四年三月二十八日于维也纳
