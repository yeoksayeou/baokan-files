Higher Education Press and Finance & Economics Press
Will be Established in Beijing on May 1st

The nationwide Higher Education Press and Finance & Economics Press are scheduled to be formally established in Beijing on May 1st.

The establishment of these two publishing houses will gradually overcome the current shortage of textbooks for universities and secondary vocational schools, as well as books on finance and economics, initially satisfying the urgent needs of the state and the people.

The Higher Education Press is established by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the General Administration of Publications. Its guiding principle and task are: based on the teaching situation in universities and secondary vocational schools, to vigorously organize social writing and translation forces, and to systematically publish Chinese translations of Soviet university and secondary specialized school textbooks in science, engineering, agriculture, and some social sciences. It will also selectively publish relatively suitable textbooks compiled by various universities in China to meet the needs of the country in training talents for socialist construction.

The Higher Education Press plans to publish more than 200 books from May to December 1954. Among them, there are 180 types of textbooks and reference books for universities in the fields of machinery, aviation, electrical engineering, civil engineering and water conservancy, metallurgy, chemical industry, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy and meteorology, agriculture, forestry and biology, 80 types of lecture notes exchanged among universities, and 22 types of textbooks for secondary technical schools in the fields of machinery, electrical engineering, aviation, metallurgy, and chemical industry.

The Finance & Economics Press is established by several financial and economic departments of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the General Administration of Publications. Its guiding principle and task are: to follow the Party's general line during the transition period, to cooperate with the needs of national economic construction, to organize and cultivate social writing and translation forces, and to compile and publish books related to national economic planning, statistics, accounting, business management, finance, banking, domestic and foreign trade, agricultural economics and production technology, grain, cooperation, meteorology, and general finance and economics, targeting financial and economic cadres with secondary education or above as the main readers. This will strengthen the publicity and education of Marxist-Leninist financial and economic theories, policies, and professional knowledge for financial and economic cadres. At the same time, it will compile and publish some textbooks for higher and secondary schools in the above-mentioned aspects.

The Finance & Economics Press plans to publish more than 240 financial and economic books from May to December 1954. Among them, there are 45 new books on national economic planning, statistics, accounting, business management, trade, and cooperation, 28 new books on finance and banking, 20 new books on agricultural economics, and 150 new books on agricultural technology and textbooks for higher and secondary schools.
