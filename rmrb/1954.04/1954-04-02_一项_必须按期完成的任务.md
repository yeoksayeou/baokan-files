Reader's Letters Abstract:

    A "Must Be Completed on Time" Task

    Reader Zhao Hui and others wrote: The Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration held a meeting last November and assigned a batch of 1954 production tasks to the Kailuan Machinery Repair Factory, including vertical shaft caissons, wellheads, and clamshell cars. At the meeting, Li Ziliang, director of the Capital Construction Department, said, "These tasks are very important and must be completed on time!" The delivery dates for each product were specifically stipulated at that time. Among them, twelve clamshell cars were scheduled to be delivered by the end of January this year, and it was decided to immediately supply the materials. After the meeting, the Capital Construction Department reported the process of assigning this task to He Baisha, director of the Kailuan General Administration. Director He repeatedly instructed the Kailuan Machinery Repair Factory to "complete the task on time, no matter what."

    In this way, the Kailuan Machinery Repair Factory arranged its first quarter production plan for this year according to the instructions from higher authorities last December, deciding that in addition to completing the spring overhaul, the main task in January would be to complete the production of clamshell cars. In January this year, the materials were delayed in arriving. The factory hurriedly called the Capital Construction Department to inquire, and they replied, "These clamshell cars belong to the Mining Company, please ask them for the materials!" The Machinery Repair Factory then asked the Mining Company, and the person in charge of the Mining Company said, "We are the users of the clamshell cars, and the Capital Construction Department should be responsible for the materials." Thus, they shirked responsibility to each other, and no one was willing to take responsibility. Finally, the Machinery Repair Factory wrote three official letters in a row, reporting the situation to He Baisha, director of the General Administration. But all three reports were like a stone sinking into the sea. The date for starting work had arrived, but without materials, the workers could only stare at each other blankly. In mid-January, the materials still had not arrived, and it seemed that the task would not be completed. The workers raised opinions one after another: "You ask us to complete the plan, how can we complete it without materials?" "How can we cook rice without rice?" "The country has entered the second year of the great Five-Year Plan construction, but our factory is still like this!" When will this phenomenon be eliminated? All the workers of the Machinery Repair Factory are eagerly awaiting a reply from the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration.

### 一项“必须按期完成的任务”

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一项“必须按期完成的任务”
    读者赵惠等来信：开滦煤矿总管理处去年十一月开会，给开滦机械制修厂布置了一批一九五四年的生产任务，其中有竖井的井圈、井架子、蛤子车等。会上，基本建设处处长李子良说：“这些任务非常重要，必须按期完成！”当时并具体规定了各项产品的交货日期。其中十二辆蛤子车规定今年一月底交货，并决定立即供给材料。会后，基本建设处又把布置这项任务的经过报告开滦总管理处何白沙主任。何主任又一再指示开滦机械制修厂“无论如何要按期完成任务”。
    这样，开滦机械制修厂去年十二月就按照上级指示，安排今年第一季度生产计划，决定除完成春季检修外，一月份主要是完成蛤子车的生产任务。今年一月，材料迟迟没有到来。该厂急忙用电话催问基本建设处，他们回答说：“这些蛤子车是矿井公司的，请向他们要料！”机械制修厂又问矿井公司，矿井公司的负责人说：“我们是蛤子车的使用者，材料应该由基本建设处负责。”就这样相互推诿，谁也不肯负责。最后，机械制修厂一连写了三件公函，把情况报告给总管理处主任何白沙。但三件报告均如石沉大海。该是开工的日期啦，但没有材料，工人们只好大眼瞪小眼。一月中旬，材料仍然没有到来，任务眼看完不成，工人们纷纷提意见：“叫我们完成计划，没材料怎完成呢？”“没米怎能作饭呢？”“国家进入伟大的五年计划建设的第二年，但我们厂子还是这样！”什么时候才能消灭这种现象呢？机械制修厂的全体工人殷切地盼望着开滦煤矿总管理处的答复。
