Tianjin Medical Community
Successfully Treats Hypertension with Traditional Chinese Medicine Eucommia

    The Tianjin medical community, drawing on the experience of Chinese medicine, has successfully treated hypertension patients with the traditional Chinese medicine Eucommia ulmoides.

    Lu Fengji, a doctor at the clinic of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, was the first in Tianjin to experiment with Eucommia ulmoides for treating hypertension. Starting in November of last year, he used raw Eucommia ulmoides soaked in alcohol to create Eucommia ulmoides tincture, which he used to treat nineteen hypertension patients. The results proved that the function of Eucommia ulmoides surpassed that of common drugs like Luminal and Aminophylline, and it had no side effects.

    Eucommia ulmoides is the bark of a shrub containing gum, produced in Sichuan and other places. In ancient times, Chinese medicine regarded it as an effective sedative for treating headaches, strokes, and other diseases. Soviet physicians Agranovich and Belyaeva published an article in the 1951 issue of "Soviet Medicine" magazine recommending traditional Chinese medicine Eucommia ulmoides as an effective drug for treating hypertension.

    天津医药界
    用中药杜仲治疗高血压成功
    天津市医药界吸取了我国医学的经验，试用中药杜仲治疗高血压病人成功。
    天津首先试用杜仲治疗高血压病的是国营天津纺织机械厂医务室的医生陆凤纪。他从去年十一月开始，曾用生杜仲和酒精泡制成杜仲酊，治疗过十九名高血压病人，结果证明杜仲的功能超过了鲁末那、氨基茶碱等一般的药品，而且没有副作用。
    杜仲为含有树胶的一种灌木树皮，出产在四川等地。在很早以前，我国的医学上便把它当做治疗头痛、中风等疾病有效的镇静剂。苏联医师阿格拉诺维奇和别利雅耶娃在一九五一年“苏联医学”杂志上曾著文推荐中药杜仲是治疗高血压的有效药品。（据新华社讯）
