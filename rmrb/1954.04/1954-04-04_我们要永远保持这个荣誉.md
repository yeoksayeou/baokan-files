    We Must Forever Maintain This Honor
    Guo Yu'en, 1952 National Model Worker Gold Star Medal Winner
    On February 13th of this year, Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, entrusted by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, personally awarded me the 1952 "National Model Worker Gold Star Medal." This is a great joy that I will never forget.
    After the medal was awarded, when I visited factories in Taiyuan, many worker comrades lifted me up and carried me for a long distance, unwilling to put me down. Groups of office staff came to shake my hand and ask for my autograph. The lovely Young Pioneers innocently put red scarves on me. Soon after returning to my village, I received congratulatory letters from the most beloved people of our motherland – the Chinese People's Volunteers from the distant Korean front. All of this makes me feel infinitely honored, and I will work even harder to live up to everyone's expectations of me.
    After the cooperative members saw the Gold Star Medal, their enthusiasm for production increased even more. Everyone expressed that they would resolutely respond to the call of the state and increase the production of more grain, cotton, and oil crops. This year, our cooperative aims to increase the average yield by 50 jin of grain per mu. At present, we are working hard to transport manure, harrow the land, and check seeds and farm tools, and will soon begin sowing.
    According to the principle of "combining agricultural infrastructure construction with production reform" put forward by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, we have decided to repair the two and a half li long dry canals and eighty small canals in the cooperative, and build edges and embankments on the land to conserve water and soil. In addition, we also plan to dig three wells and convert nine mu of land into wheat fields. In forestry, in addition to protecting the more than 5,000 trees planted last year and the sowing on more than 500 mu of barren hills, we also plan to plant another 25,000 trees this year.
    The Gold Star Medal has brought us unparalleled honor. All our cooperative members are determined to further improve the cooperative, ensure increased production year after year, and forever maintain this honor.

    我们要永远保持这个荣誉
    一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章获得者　郭玉恩
    今年二月十三日山西省人民政府裴丽生主席受中央人民政府农业部的委托，亲手发给我一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”，这是我永远难忘的一件大喜事。
    奖章颁发后，我在太原参观工厂时，很多工人同志把我抬起来，抬了很远还不肯放下；机关工作人员一群一群地跑来和我握手，要我签名；可爱的少年先锋队天真地给我挂上了红领巾；回村不久，又收到了祖国人民最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军从遥远的朝鲜前线寄来的祝贺信。这些都使我感到无限的光荣，我也将更加努力，不负大家对我的希望。
    社员们看到金星奖章以后，生产积极性更加高涨。大家都表示：要坚决响应国家号召，增产更多的粮食、棉花和油料作物。今年我们社平均每亩地要增产五十斤粮食。目前，我们正在紧张地送粪、耢耙地、检查种籽、农具等，马上就要开始播种。
    我们根据中共山西省委提出的“农业基本建设与生产改革相结合”的方针，决定将社内两条一里半长的旱渠和八十道小水渠重新修整，在土地上修边垒岸，以保持水土，此外，还准备淘三眼井；垫九亩地并种成麦田。在林业方面，除保护好去年栽植的五千多株树和五百多亩荒山播种外，今年还计划再植树二万五千株。
    金星奖章给我们带来了无比的荣誉，我们全体社员都有决心进一步办好合作社，保证年年增产，永远保持这个荣誉。
