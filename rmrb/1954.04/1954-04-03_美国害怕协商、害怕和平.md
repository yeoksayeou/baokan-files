The date for the Geneva Conference is approaching. Peace-loving people all over the world earnestly hope that this conference can further open the road to international consultation, further ease international tensions, and lead to lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

According to the communiqué of the Berlin Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom on February 18, the Geneva Conference will discuss: (1) "Achieving a peaceful settlement of the Korean question," which clearly states "peaceful settlement," not military settlement; (2) "Restoring peace in Indochina," which clearly states "restoring peace" and not prolonging the war. The Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China are the five countries participating in the Geneva Conference and also participating in the discussion of both issues. This is written in black and white. If we want to use the word "promise," then for Dulles, this is also a promise he made on February 18, 1954, and it should be absolutely true.

However, the US ruling clique is unwilling to see this prospect unfolded by the Geneva Conference. They are clearly dissatisfied with the agreement reached at the Berlin Conference, have been spreading the atmosphere that it is impossible to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference, and now they have gone even further, clamoring about the United States' tough policy and stepping up activities to undermine the Geneva Conference. The United States has not only approved the US-ROK "mutual defense treaty," violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, and transported large quantities of reinforcing weapons into South Korea, actively expanding the ROK puppet army, but also openly assured the Rhee Syngman group that if the Geneva Conference fails to accept the conditions for establishing a dictatorial rule by the Rhee Syngman group in the entire Korean peninsula within ninety days, they will withdraw from the conference. Consequently, the Rhee Syngman group's "resistance" to the Geneva Conference and calls for "marching north" have become rampant. Similarly, the United States is increasingly interfering in the Indochina War, trying its best to induce France to continue fighting, and conspiring to instruct the United States' puppet countries in Asia to provide cannon fodder to expand this war. These activities are clearly all obstacles pre-set by the US ruling clique against the Geneva Conference. And US Secretary of State Dulles is obviously the main character in these conspiracies.

At a press conference on March 14, Dulles groundlessly claimed that the Geneva Conference might be postponed. On March 23, he openly ordered France to continue fighting in Vietnam according to the "Navarre Plan" and to "achieve decisive military results" "a year later"; he made no secret of the fact that the United States' "policy of interfering in the Indochina War "is determined." On March 29, Dulles delivered a speech, clamoring that the "free world" should take "joint action" and "take risks" to pursue the United States' adventurous policy. Dulles' series of shouts did not explain anything else, he only showed that the US government is afraid of consultation, afraid of peace, and afraid of the Geneva Conference. What is so scary about "consultation" and "peace"? But the gentlemen in Washington are almost going crazy with fear.

Dulles' so-called "joint action" is to ask those countries that follow the United States to abandon their own national interests, abandon their independent and autonomous foreign policies, and pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. What will be the result of the so-called "joint action" and what will it give to the governments and people of the countries that follow the United States? The Korean War has already set a precedent. When the Korean armistice was just realized, Dulles immediately gathered all the countries that invaded Korea and issued a provocative so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration," forcing all countries to continue to "consistently" implement the US policy of conspiring with the Rhee Syngman group to undermine the Korean armistice. Now, Dulles has once again shouted out this hawkish voice. But people have long understood that the actual intention of the so-called "joint action" is to use other people's hands and the lives of people from other countries as a way to create tension, prepare to expand the Indochina War, and create profits for American monopoly capitalists.

From Dulles' speech, people cannot find any words about restoring peace in Indochina; it only talks about withdrawing troops on the Korean issue, and only demands the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers without mentioning that the United States should withdraw its troops at the same time. In his speech, Dulles tried his best to create the already bankrupt myth of the so-called "threat" and "danger" of China and the Soviet Union, and re-emphasized the theory that the Southeast Asian region is of "overriding importance" to them, which was recently said by US President Eisenhower, emphasizing that any peaceful solution to the Indochina issue is a "fatal danger" to the United States, to deceive and蒙蔽 the American people and support the adventurous policy of the monopoly capital group.

However, everyone clearly knows that the dangerous factors currently existing in the Far East and the world are precisely Washington's policy of strength. This policy continues to threaten the peace and security of all countries and violates the interests of all countries. People from all social strata in France are widely demanding the restoration of an independent and autonomous foreign policy. They first seek to end the Indochina War to get rid of France's current predicament. Many people in the United Kingdom also hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve results in order to ease international tensions and open up the road for the development of East-West trade.

It is precisely because of this that the US ruling clique deeply feels uneasy and constantly exerts pressure on Britain and France, especially on France, in an attempt to force them to obey the will of the United States. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson also threatened that "French friends and other friends of other countries" must agree with the United States' opinions and never make concessions at the Geneva Conference. Dulles' recent speech once again ordered its allies to "bravely and decisively" "unite" with the United States. Obviously, the ruling groups of these countries are once again facing a test, and peace-loving people all over the world will pay attention to their actions.

Dulles is deliberately hostile to the great People's Republic of China, insisting that the Geneva Conference is not a five-power conference held by the Soviet Union, China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States with the participation of other relevant countries, and falsely accusing that this view was "agreed to" by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Dulles' lies were immediately exposed by the Soviet Foreign Ministry. The Soviet Foreign Ministry said in response to a question from a Pravda reporter: "Mr. Dulles obviously deliberately disregarded the facts that everyone knows when making the above speech." After Dulles exhausted everything to reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, slander the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and falsely accuse China and the Soviet Union of not keeping international "promises," he openly stated that "now the policy of the United States is: not to exchange the actual fulfillment of promises by the United States for the promises of the Communists." It is clear that the United States' attitude towards international consultation will not be of any benefit.

The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have always maintained international agreements, abide by their own promises, and tirelessly strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is a fact that everyone can see. On the contrary, the United States' record of behavior in international relations is the most untrustworthy. Many international agreements after World War II, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement and Proclamation, have been torn up by the United States. The United States has broken its promise of "non-interference in China's internal affairs" countless times, and interfered in China under the guise of Marshall's "mediation"; the United States also openly armed and occupied our country's territory of Taiwan. The process of the Korean armistice negotiations and the implementation of the armistice agreement is especially full of incidents of American perfidy. The United States not only violated the already reached agreement on prisoners of war before the armistice was realized, and condoned the Rhee Syngman group to forcibly detain more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; but also blatantly destroyed the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" after the armistice was realized, and armed and robbed more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who had not been explained. Recently, the United States has violated the provisions of the armistice agreement and shipped reinforcing weapons into South Korea, which has been repeatedly confirmed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In the face of these many irrefutable facts, isn't it clear that Dulles' slander against China and the Soviet Union is ulterior motives? This will have no other effect than to prove his attempt to create an atmosphere of antagonism in international relations.

Dulles is doing his best to create this atmosphere of hostility entirely to cater to the will of the American monopoly capital group. In order to avoid the looming economic crisis and pursue maximum profits from the arms expansion and war preparation movement, they are willing to maintain and exacerbate international tensions at any cost. Recently, American political leaders openly discussed the so-called "New Look" military policy, advocated "atomic attacks," spread war hysteria, and conducted hydrogen bomb explosion tests in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, held naval exercises in the Iwo Jima Islands, and held air force exercises in South Korea. All of these are clearly attempts to poison the international atmosphere on the eve of the Geneva Conference, and use this to intimidate the people of the United States and the Atlantic Group countries, to make them obediently continue to tighten their belts for the United States' war preparation plan.

However, this kind of activity of the US ruling clique to advocate war and undermine the Geneva Conference will only cause its own extreme isolation. All peace-loving forces will see through the United States' intentions, make persistent efforts to resolutely promote the timely and smooth convening of the Geneva Conference, and insist on seeking further easing of international tensions through international consultation.

### 美国害怕协商、害怕和平

    美国害怕协商、害怕和平
    日内瓦会议召开的日期已经临近了。全世界爱好和平的人民都殷切地希望这个会议能够进一步打开国际协商的道路，进一步缓和国际紧张局势，导致远东和世界的持久和平。
    根据二月十八日苏联、美国、法国、英国四国外长柏林会议的公报，日内瓦会议将讨论：（一）“对朝鲜问题取得和平解决”，这里明明写的“和平解决”，而不是武力解决；（二）“恢复印度支那和平问题”，这里明明写的“恢复和平”而不是延长战争；参加日内瓦会议而同时参加两个问题的讨论的是苏联、美国、法国、英国和中华人民共和国五个国家。黑字写在白纸上。如果高兴用“诺言”字样的话，那么，对于杜勒斯来说，这也是他在一九五四年二月十八日许下的诺言，该是千真万确的了吧。
    但是，美国统治集团对于日内瓦会议所展开的这个前景，不愿意看到。他们显然不满意柏林会议所取得的协议，一直在散布日内瓦会议不可能达成协议的空气，现在又更进一步，大嚷起美国的强硬政策，加紧进行破坏日内瓦会议的活动。美国不仅批准了美李“共同防御条约”，违反朝鲜停战协定，把大批增援性武器源源运入南朝鲜，积极扩充李承晚伪军，而且竟公开向李承晚集团提出保证，说什么日内瓦会议在九十天内如果不能接受由李承晚集团在全朝鲜建立独裁统治的条件，他们就要退出会议。随着，李承晚集团对日内瓦会议的“抵制”和“向北进军”的叫嚷也就嚣张起来。同样，美国正日甚一日地干涉印度支那战争，极力诱迫法国继续打下去，并阴谋指使美国在亚洲的傀儡国家提供炮灰来扩大这个战争。这些活动显然都是美国统治集团针对着日内瓦会议而预先设置的重重障碍。而美国国务卿杜勒斯显然是这些阴谋活动中的主要角色。
    杜勒斯在三月十四日记者招待会上，毫无根据地声言日内瓦会议可能延期。他在三月二十三日又公开命令法国按照“纳瓦尔计划”继续在越南作战，并在“一年以后”“取得决定性的军事结果”；他毫不掩饰地说，美国这种干涉印度支那战争的“政策是确定了的”。杜勒斯在三月二十九日又发表演说，大声叫嚷“自由世界”应该采取“联合行动”，“担当风险”，来奉行美国的冒险政策。杜勒斯的这一连串喊叫没有说明别的，他只说明美国政府害怕协商、害怕和平、害怕日内瓦会议。“协商”、“和平”，这有什么可怕的呢？但是华盛顿的老爷们竟怕得快要发疯了。
    杜勒斯的所谓“联合行动”，就是要那些追随美国的各国放弃它们本国的利益，放弃它们的独立自主的外交政策，为美国火中取栗。所谓“联合行动”，会得到什么结果，会给予追随美国的各国政府和各国人民以什么东西，朝鲜战争已经有了先例。在朝鲜停战刚刚实现的时候，杜勒斯又马上纠集所有侵朝国家发表挑衅性的所谓“十六国宣言”，强制各国继续“一致”地执行美国与李承晚集团密谋破坏朝鲜停战的政策。现在，杜勒斯再度喊出了这种好战的声音。可是人们早已懂得，所谓“联合行动”的实际意图，是要假他人之手，以他国人民替死的办法，来制造紧张局势，准备扩大印度支那战争，为美国垄断资本家制造利润。
    从杜勒斯的演说中，人们根本找不到恢复印度支那和平的字句；它对于朝鲜问题也只谈到撤军，并且只是要求撤退中国人民志愿军而不提美国应同时撤兵。杜勒斯在演说中竭力制造早已破产了的所谓中苏两国的“威胁”和“危险”的神话，并重新强调美国总统艾森豪威尔最近所说的东南亚地区对他们有“超越一切的重要性”的论调，强调所谓对印度支那问题的任何和平解决对美国将是“致命的危险”，来欺骗与蒙蔽美国人民，去支持垄断资本集团的冒险政策。
    但是，谁都清楚地知道，目前在远东和全世界存在着的危险因素，正是华盛顿的实力政策。这个政策继续威胁着各国的和平与安全，并违反所有国家的利益。法国各社会阶层人士是广泛地要求恢复独立自主的外交政策的。他们首先谋求结束印度支那战争，以摆脱法国目前所处的困境。英国许多人士也希望日内瓦会议获得成果，以便缓和国际紧张局势，和为发展东西贸易开辟道路。
    正是因为这样，美国统治集团深切地感到不安，并不断对英法、特别是对法国施行压力，企图强迫它们服从美国的意旨。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊也曾虚声恫吓说，“法国朋友和其他国家的朋友”必须同意美国的意见，决不在日内瓦会议上让步。杜勒斯最近的演说又一次发号施令地要它的盟国“勇敢地果断地”和美国“联合起来”。显然，这些国家的统治集团再一次面临着考验，全世界爱好和平的人民将注视他们的行动。
    杜勒斯存心敌视伟大的中华人民共和国，硬说日内瓦会议不是一个由苏联、中国、法国、英国、美国五个国家在其他有关国家参加下举行的五大国会议，并诬赖说这种见解是苏联外长莫洛托夫“同意”的。杜勒斯的谎话，立即被苏联外交部所揭破了，苏联外交部在答真理报记者的问题时说：“杜勒斯先生在作上述演说时，显然是存心不考虑大家都知道的事实的。”杜勒斯在竭尽一切地颠倒黑白、混淆是非、污蔑苏联和中华人民共和国的和平政策，并诬指中苏两国不守国际“诺言”之后，就公然表示“现在美国的政策是：不用美国的实际履行诺言来交换共产党的诺言”。美国对于国际协商采取这样的态度，显然是不会有任何益处的。
    苏联和中华人民共和国一贯维护国际协议，遵守自己的诺言，并为朝鲜停战协定的彻底实现而不懈努力，这是人所共见的事实。相反的，美国在国际关系上的行为纪录，却是最不讲信义的。第二次世界大战后的许多国际协议，如开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦协定和公告，都已被美国撕毁无余。美国曾无数次地背弃它“不干涉中国内政”的诺言，在马歇尔“调处”的掩饰下对中国实行过干涉；美国还公然武装侵占了我国的领土台湾。朝鲜停战谈判和停战协定实施的过程，尤其是充满了美国背信弃义的事件。美国不仅在停战实现之前，违背已达成的关于战俘的协议，纵容李承晚集团强迫扣留了两万七千余名朝中战俘；而且在停战实现之后，又悍然破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，武装劫走了两万一千多名未经解释的朝中战俘。最近美国又破坏停战协定的规定，向南朝鲜运入增援性的武器，这已为中立国监察委员会所一再证实。在这许多无可辩驳的事实面前，杜勒斯对中苏两国的诬蔑是别有用心的，难道还不明白么？这除了证明他企图制造国际关系的敌对气氛之外，是不会有其他作用的。
    杜勒斯竭力制造这种敌对气氛，完全是为了投合美国垄断资本集团的意旨。他们为了避免日益逼近的经济危机，并从扩军备战运动中追逐最大限度的利润，正不惜以任何代价来维持和加剧国际紧张局势。最近美国政治领袖们公开讨论所谓“新面貌”军事政策，鼓吹“原子攻击”，大肆散布战争歇斯底里，并在太平洋马绍尔群岛进行氢弹爆炸试验，在硫磺群岛举行海军演习，在南朝鲜举行空军演习，都显然是企图毒化日内瓦会议前夕的国际空气，并借此恫吓美国和大西洋集团国家的人民，要他们顺从地为美国的备战计划而继续勒紧腰带。
    然而，美国统治集团的这种鼓吹战争和破坏日内瓦会议的活动，只会造成它自己的极端孤立。一切爱好和平的力量，会识破美国的用心，再接再厉地坚决促成日内瓦会议按时顺利的召开，坚持通过国际协商，以求得进一步缓和国际的紧张局势。
