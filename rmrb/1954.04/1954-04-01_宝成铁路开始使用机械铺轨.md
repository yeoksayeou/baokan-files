    Baoji-Chengdu Railway Begins Using Mechanical Track Laying

    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway began using mechanical track laying from Zhongba, Jiangyou on March 15th.

    The workers of the track laying and bridge building team, in order to use mechanical track laying, took time to study diligently and came up with many ways to overcome the difficulties in the initial use of mechanical track laying. During the first test in Bali Zhuang, Chengdu on July 25th last year, because everyone was not familiar with the track frame, the crane did not rotate 180 degrees after lifting, and it took eight minutes to lay a track frame. After track laying to Mianyang, a second test was conducted, but it still took five minutes to lay a track frame. During the third test on February 22nd this year, due to everyone's enthusiastic labor and close cooperation, it only took two minutes to lay and lift a track frame.

    The use of mechanical track laying on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can not only gradually reduce the heavy physical labor of the workers and ensure the quality of the project, but also save a lot of labor. In the past, more than 500 people had to work on site at the same time for track laying, but now only 26 people are needed.

    宝成铁路开始使用机械铺轨
    宝成铁路于三月十五日从江油中坝起，开始使用机械铺轨。
    钉道架桥队的工人们，为了使用机械铺轨，抽出时间认真进行了学习，并想了许多办法克服初次使用机械铺轨中的困难。去年七月二十五日，在成都八里庄初次试验时，由于大家对挂轨框不熟，吊车吊起没转过一百八十度，铺一个轨框要八分钟。铺轨到绵阳后，又进行了第二次试验，但仍要五分钟才能铺好一个轨框。今年二月二十二日第三次试验时，由于大家热情地劳动，紧密地配合，铺吊一个轨框只要两分钟了。
    宝成铁路使用机械铺轨，不仅可逐渐减少工人们笨重的体力劳动，保证工程质量，同时，可节约大量劳动力。以往铺轨要五百多人同时在现场工作，而现在只要二十六个人就行了。
