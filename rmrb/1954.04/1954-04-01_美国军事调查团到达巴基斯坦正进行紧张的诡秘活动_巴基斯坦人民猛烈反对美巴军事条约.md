Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: In order to intensify the transformation of Pakistan into a US military base, a US military investigation group headed by Brigadier General Harry F. Meyers is conducting tense and covert activities in Pakistan. The investigation group arrived in Pakistan on the 22nd.

A United Press International dispatch from Karachi stated that after arriving in Pakistan, the group immediately "visited" Pakistan's Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad and Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, and held preliminary discussions with Pakistani army officers. On the 25th, the group flew to Rawalpindi, the location of the Pakistan Army headquarters, to "investigate the country's military equipment in accordance with Western defense requirements." UPI said that both Pakistani and American officials are "keeping silent" about the group's daily activities.

According to the United States Information Service, the US military investigation group's arrival in Pakistan "is a prelude to formulating the details of a military assistance plan for Pakistan." A UPI dispatch from Washington stated: "Advance personnel from the US military assistance advisory group responsible for supervising the allocation and use of US aid may arrive in Karachi within two or three months to prepare for the implementation of the plan."

According to a Karachi dispatch published by the Indian "Blitz" weekly on the 27th, the hasty arrival of the US military investigation group in Pakistan is related to the extreme panic of the US towards the ruling Muslim League's comprehensive failure in the East Pakistan Constituent Assembly elections. The dispatch stated: The people of Karachi regard the defeat suffered by the Muslim League as a defeat suffered by the US warmongering policy in the hands of the people of East Pakistan. "Blitz" weekly stated: "Although the Americans have felt panic, they still stubbornly refuse to give up their sinister plans against the interests of the Indian and Pakistani people."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: The movement against the US-Pakistan military treaty is vigorously unfolding in Pakistan among a wide range of social strata.

The Executive Committee of the Pakistan Islamic Association recently issued a statement, pointing out that the Pakistani people's concern that the US-Pakistan military treaty would affect their independence is well-founded. The statement said: "Conducting such a transaction will not only cost our country a great price, but will not be accepted by the people under any circumstances."

Pakistani parliamentarian Dutta gave a speech in the Constituent Assembly on the 25th, denouncing the act of accepting US military "aid", believing that this is reversing history and means bringing destruction to Pakistan. He also warned that the United States will control Pakistan's army.

The movement against US aggression is also unfolding in various parts of West Pakistan. Mass rallies protesting the US-Pakistan military treaty have been held in many places, including Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, Lahore and Gujranwala, the capitals of West Punjab Province, and Baghdad-ul-Jadid, the capital of Bahawalpur State, the largest state in West Pakistan. The mass rally in Lahore was held on the 26th. The conference was presided over by Mahmud Ali, chairman of the West Punjab Provincial Organization of the Azad Pakistan Party. Muhammad Shafi, a member of the West Punjab Legislative Assembly, and Kamaruddin, chairman of the West Punjab Muslim League, criticized the US conspiracy at the meeting. Syed Sibte Hassan, a member of the Pakistan Communist Party, pointed out at the meeting that the United States is attempting to bind the "friendly nations" with the so-called Common Security Act, and the US military "aid" to Pakistan is based on this.

At rallies celebrating the victory of the United Front in the East Pakistan elections, calls against the US-Pakistan military treaty were made. United Front leader Bhashani pointed out that "this enslavement treaty pawns our motherland to the US imperialist warmongers." The vice-chancellors, secretaries-general, and student representatives of various colleges and vocational schools under the East Pakistan University, College and Vocational School Federation held a conference in Dhaka on the 20th, vehemently criticizing the US-Pakistan military treaty. The conference requested the leaders of various organizations under the Federation to issue a joint statement condemning the US aggression conspiracy. The conference also decided to establish the East Pakistan Vocational School Students Federation.

    美国军事调查团到达巴基斯坦正进行紧张的诡秘活动
    巴基斯坦人民猛烈反对美巴军事条约
    【新华社三十日讯】为了加紧变巴基斯坦为美国的军事基地，以哈里·弗·麦耶斯准将为首的美国军事调查团正在巴基斯坦进行紧张的诡秘活动。调查团是在二十二日到达巴基斯坦的。
    合众社喀喇蚩消息说：这个调查团到巴基斯坦后即“拜访”了巴基斯坦总督吴拉姆·穆罕默德和总理穆罕默德·阿里。并和巴基斯坦陆军军官进行了初步讨论。二十五日，该团飞往巴基斯坦陆军总部所在地拉瓦尔品第，以“按照西方防御要求来调查这个国家的军事装备”。合众社说：巴基斯坦官员和美国官员都对该团每天的活动“保持缄默”。
    据美国新闻处说，美国军事调查团到巴基斯坦，“是拟订对巴基斯坦军事援助计划的细节的前奏”。合众社从华盛顿发出的消息说：“负责监督美国援助的分配与使用的美国军事援助顾问团中的先行人员可能在两三个月内到达喀喇蚩以准备施行该计划事宜”。
    据印度“闪电”周报二十七日登载的喀喇蚩消息披露，美国军事调查团急急忙忙到达巴基斯坦，和美国对巴基斯坦执政党回教联盟在东巴基斯坦制宪议会选举中全面失败引起的极端恐慌有一定关系。消息说：喀喇蚩的人们把回教联盟所遭受的失败认为是美国好战政策在东巴基斯坦人民手中所遭到的失败。“闪电”周报说：“美国人虽然已感到恐慌，但是仍然固执地不想放弃他们反对印度人民和巴基斯坦人民利益的凶恶计划。”
    据新华社新德里电：巴基斯坦广泛阶层反对美巴军事条约的运动猛烈展开。
    巴基斯坦伊斯兰教协会执行委员会最近发表声明，指出巴基斯坦人民忧虑美巴军事条约影响他们的独立是很有理由的。声明说：“进行这样的交易，不仅会使我国付出极大的代价，而且在任何情况下也不会为人民所接受。”
    巴基斯坦议员杜塔二十五日在制宪议会发表演说，指斥接受美国军事“援助”的行为，认为这是使历史开倒车，是意味着给巴基斯坦带来毁灭。他并警告说，美国将要控制巴基斯坦的军队。
    反对美国侵略阴谋的运动也在西巴基斯坦各地展开。在西北边省省会白沙瓦、西旁遮普省省会拉合尔与古吉兰瓦拉、伊汉，和西巴基斯坦最大的邦——巴哈瓦尔浦尔邦——的首府巴格达—乌尔—加迪德等许多地方，都举行了抗议美巴军事条约的群众大会。拉合尔的群众大会在二十六日举行。大会由自由巴基斯坦党西旁遮普省组织的主席马茂德·阿里主持。西旁遮普省立法会议议员穆罕默德·夏菲、西旁遮普回教联盟主席卡马鲁定等都在会上抨击美国的阴谋。巴基斯坦共产党党员赛义德·西勃蒂·哈桑在大会上指出美国企图以所谓共同安全法来束缚各“友邦”，美国对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”，正是以此为根据的。
    在东巴基斯坦各地举行的庆祝联合阵线选举胜利的集会上，都发出了反对美巴军事条约的呼声。联合阵线的领袖巴沙尼指出“这个奴役条约把我们的祖国押给了美帝国主义战争贩子”。东巴基斯坦的大学、学院与专科学校联合会所属各院校的副校长、秘书长和学生代表二十日在达卡举行大会，猛烈抨击美巴军事条约。大会要求联合会所属各组织的领袖发表联合声明谴责美国的侵略阴谋。大会并决定成立东巴基斯坦专科学校学生联合会。
