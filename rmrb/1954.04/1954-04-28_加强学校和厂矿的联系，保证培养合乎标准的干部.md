    Strengthen the Connection Between Schools and Factories to Ensure the Training of Qualified Cadres
    Hong Ming
    The issue of connections between higher education institutions and technical schools with factories and mines is receiving increasing attention. It should be said that the current situation in this regard is generally not good enough. Both sides feel unnatural and not close enough, and feel that there are still many difficulties in resolving this issue.
    There are many reasons for the above situation. From the school's perspective, not all schools have a deep understanding of the importance of strengthening the connection between schools and factories to implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice. Therefore, some schools do not do enough to collect practical information and the latest technical achievements from factories and mines to enrich teaching content, organize and lead production practice well, and strive for strong assistance from factories and mines. Some schools are only busy arranging classrooms, dormitories, dining halls, and auditoriums, but have not settled on laboratories and practice factories. Some schools do not understand what production practice is all about, how to do it well, and do not carefully study these issues. Often, when it is almost time for practice, they casually send an instructor to take the students to the site, without explaining the practice tasks or methods to them. As a result, after the instructors arrive at the factory or mine, they only care about finding information and looking at the machines, but do not care about the students, thinking that is the responsibility of the factory or mine. These situations cannot but have an impact on the students' thinking.
    From the perspective of factories and mines, there are also many problems. The educational policy of combining theory and practice inherently implies that the theoretical teaching of schools must serve production and must be closely linked to the actual situation of factories and mines. Therefore, it also requires factories and mines to assist schools in implementing this policy together. Determining training goals, formulating teaching plans, and conducting scientific research, especially production practice, all require assistance from factories and mines. In the past, we did not emphasize this enough, nor did we publicize it enough. We only talked about how schools should pay attention to intuitive teaching, how to do a good job in experiments and practices, etc., but rarely mentioned what role factories and mines should play and what work they should do in implementing the new education policy and cultivating new types of technical personnel. This has led some factory and mine cadres to have the view that since cadres are trained in schools, it is the school's business. Factories and mines only manage production, and the tasks are very heavy. Asking factories and mines to assist schools is naturally an "extra burden." Therefore, they do not pay much attention to the connection with schools. If they can push things away, they will. If they cannot push things away, they will just perfunctorily deal with them. For example, some schools raise questions about what kind of work certain cadres do in production positions, and what theoretical knowledge and operational skills they must possess to do these jobs well, and ask the relevant factories and mines to answer them. However, the latter often do not go deep into construction sites and workshops, absorb relevant personnel, and conduct serious research based on the actual production and technical situation to tell the school. Some even push the matter back and forth, and there is no answer for a long time. Even if they barely come up with an answer, its reference value is also questionable. There are also cases where schools repeatedly consult with factories and mines for a piece of information or a practice opportunity, but there is still no result. Finally, the responsible comrades of both sides have to negotiate in person before the problem can be solved.
    It should be admitted that factories and mines do have some specific difficulties. For example, it is not easy to handle the issue of schools requesting data and charts because the secrecy system and secrecy standards are difficult to grasp. Also, too many people and too many times for production practice will increase trouble and affect production. The arrangement of food and lodging, the preparation of tools, materials, and protective equipment also require a lot of time. Moreover, extra attention must be paid to personal safety and machine protection, all of which need to be carefully considered. Especially when factories and mines have tight tasks and few cadres, and there is no special agency or cadre to cooperate with the school, the difficulties are indeed many. Therefore, they are not very willing to accept teachers and students from schools to come to factories and mines for practice, or they have a mentality of coming as little as possible, or preferably not coming at all.
    Under these circumstances, both schools and factories and mines emphasize their own tasks, pay attention to their own difficulties, and hope that the other party will assist and take care of them more. However, they do not pay enough attention to understanding the other party's actual situation, trying to solve the other party's problems, and meeting the other party's requirements. In this way, it is not easy for the two sides to come together, and even if the relationship is established, it is difficult to maintain it. For example, in production practice, schools believe that since it is an organic part of the teaching process and an important link in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, factories and mines should actively assist and ensure that it is done well—accommodate more practice students, let them do more hands-on operations, and send more technicians to explain and guide; even if it affects the completion of production tasks, it is permissible. The choice of practice places is mostly oriented towards large factories and mines or advanced factories and mines. When it comes to hydropower, everyone thinks of Fengman; when it comes to collecting information, everyone wants to see everything and wants everything. They do not consider the strength and actual difficulties of factories and mines enough. Factories and mines, on the other hand, hope to solve some of their own technical problems through production practice, hope that schools will make innovation suggestions, and hope that schools will give more special reports. They do not consider enough whether the school can do it. These are all wrong.
    Finally, the connection between schools and factories and mines is, after all, a new task, and there are not many experiences and methods yet. Some factories and mines do not understand how schools work at all, let alone how to assist them. For example, the set of methods for organizing production practice—formulating practice outlines and practice plans, doing pre-practice preparations, and on-site organization and leadership, writing practice diaries, and making practice reports, etc.—not only many factories and mines have no experience, but even schools are not so familiar with it.
    The above problems should be solved with effective measures. Otherwise, the cause of cultivating new types of technical talents will be seriously affected.
    How to solve these problems? My preliminary opinion is:
    First, schools must clearly recognize that vigorously striving for the assistance and support of factories and mines and taking the initiative to contact factories and mines is the key to doing a good job in teaching. Therefore, it is necessary to have a good understanding and study of the difficulties that are hindering the strengthening of the connection between the two sides, so as to work together with factories and mines to find ways to overcome them and actively create favorable conditions to make the connection between the two sides closer. It should be noted that do not just make demands on factories and mines, but try to provide some help to factories and mines as much as possible. For example, understand and study the production and technical problems of factories and mines; make production practice as beneficial to production as possible (there are already many successful examples in this regard. Some have assisted factories and mines in completing tasks ahead of schedule without reducing the quality of practice, some have discovered production problems and put forward many rationalization proposals, and some have solved certain technical problems); help factory and mine technicians improve their theoretical level and summarize advanced experience, etc. Only in this way can we achieve mutual assistance and benefit, and make our relationship closer.
    Factory and mine cadres must clearly recognize that schools are places for training cadres, and factories and mines are places for using cadres. Whether the cadres trained by schools meet the standards will directly affect the production tasks of factories and mines. The production practice of factories and mines is infinitely rich teaching material. If factories and mines do not provide information and do not pay attention to production practice, the school's teaching will lack vivid content, and the talents cultivated will not meet the specifications. Therefore, for the sake of the country's socialist industrialization, for the sake of the production tasks of the factories and mines themselves, and to ensure the quality of the talents being trained, factories and mines should provide specific assistance to schools and provide schools with various conveniences for carrying out work in their own factories and mines. In particular, production practice should be jointly guaranteed with the school.
    Second, it is not enough to have a clear understanding in thinking. It is also necessary to establish certain systems on relevant issues and appropriately solve some specific difficulties. This will lay a favorable foundation for the close connection between schools and factories and mines. Taking production practice as an example, schools and factories and mines often deal with this matter, so it is necessary to clearly point out in documents such as production practice regulations that this is a common task for both parties and stipulate the responsibilities of both parties, what they should do, and how to do it. In this way, when relevant leading departments deploy the annual tasks of a certain factory or mine, they can take into account the work of accepting production practice. In addition, factories and mines should, according to the situation, consider setting up special institutions to guide production practice, equip full-time or part-time cadres, and prepare a certain budget of funds. The Soviet practice is: if the factory or mine accepts more than fifty teachers and students for practice, it will set up a full-time cadre; part-time personnel will also be given appropriate remuneration as an encouragement. In this way, with people, money, and rules and regulations to follow, plus the attention of the leadership, it will be easy to handle.
    Third, a system for supplying information must be established. At present, the biggest problems in this regard are, first, secrecy, and second, that no one in factories and mines is responsible for collecting and actively providing information to schools. Regarding the former, I believe that as long as the secrecy system is sound and the loopholes in leaking secrets are plugged, all the information necessary for teaching should be provided. For example, the following method can be adopted: the school sends teachers and students to the factory or mine to do a specific practice project, or collect information on a certain teaching material and topic. As long as it is related to it, they can be allowed to see, record, and copy it. However, if it is taken away, whether it is the original manuscript or one's own copy, it must be roughly divided into different degrees of secrecy, approved by a certain institution, or submitted to the school's confidentiality office through the confidentiality system. Of course, the school must also establish and improve the confidentiality agency and confidentiality system to ensure that there is no loss of secrets or leakage of secrets. Regarding the latter, the school should be diligent in raising the content of the required information, often contact factories and mines, plus the attention of the factory and mine's special agencies or full-time or part-time cadres, then it can be largely resolved.
    Fourth, vigorously introduce the specific experiences and practices of close contact, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit between factories and mines and schools. For example, in production practice, since this is a new task and everyone is unfamiliar with it, the work experience and advanced methods of schools and factory and mine leaders in guiding production practice should be introduced in detail so that everyone can learn from it and avoid detours.
    Fifth, schools and factories and mines should try their best to estimate each other's work tasks, help each other, and solve difficulties together. Both sides should not make excessive demands. After each production practice is over, both sides can study which method is beneficial to both sides, so as to promote the good and criticize the bad. This will help the close connection between schools and factories and mines.
    Sixth, establish a contact system. Of course, it is impossible and unnecessary to establish universal connections between all schools in the country and all factories and mines in the country. Connections can be established separately according to the nature of the majors offered by the school and the relevant factories and mines. That is to say, a school can have close contact with one or two corresponding factories and mines. For the school, the factory and mine seems to be acting as a practice factory. For the factory and mine, the school seems to be acting as its own technical research institute. Both sides list the work that should be done in the plan and put forward guarantees. In this way, the school's teaching and scientific research can be combined with the actual situation of factories and mines; factories and mines can make theoretical summaries of practical operational experience and improve technical levels. At present, some schools and factories and mines have signed cooperation contracts, which is worth promoting. Naturally, this work also needs to be carried out under leadership, otherwise, concentrating this connection on a few advanced factories and mines or large factories and mines, making them bear too heavy tasks, will actually become a formality.

    加强学校和厂矿的联系，保证培养合乎标准的干部
    洪明
    高等学校和中等技术学校与厂矿的联系问题，越来越被大家所注意。应该说，这方面的情况目前一般是不够好的，双方都感到不自然，不密切，而且觉得这个问题的解决还有很多困难。
    造成上述情况的原因是多方面的。从学校方面说，对密切学校和厂矿的联系，以贯彻理论和实际相结合的教学方针，并不是所有学校都已有很深刻的认识的。因此，注意搜集厂矿的实际资料及技术上的最新成就来丰富教学内容，很好地组织和领导生产实习工作，争取厂矿的大力协助等，有些学校就做得不够。有的学校只忙着安排教室、寝室以及饭厅、礼堂，但实验室、实习工厂却没有着落。有的学校不大懂得生产实习这一套究竟是怎么一回事，怎样才能做好，而且也不去仔细研究这些问题，往往临到快要实习了，才随便派一位指导教师把学生带到现场，至于实习任务、做法都没有向他们交代清楚。结果指导教师到厂矿后，只顾自己找资料，看机器，却不管学生了，认为那是厂矿的事。这些情形，对学生的思想不能不发生影响。
    从厂矿方面说，也存在着不少问题。理论和实际相结合这一教育方针的本身原来就包含着这样一种意义，即学校的理论教学必须为生产服务，必须密切联系厂矿实际，因而也就要求厂矿协助学校共同贯彻这个方针。像确定培养目标，制订教学计划，进行科学研究工作，尤其是生产实习，无一不需要厂矿方面的协助。过去我们对这一点强调不够，宣传不够。我们只讲学校要如何注意直观教学，如何搞好实验、实习等等，而对于厂矿在贯彻新的教育方针、培养新型技术人才的任务中应起什么作用，应做什么工作，很少提到。这就使某些厂矿干部产生了这样一种看法：干部既在学校里培养，那就是学校的事，厂矿只管生产，而且任务很重，要厂矿协助学校，那自然是有些“额外负担”了。因此不大关心和学校的联系，有事能推就推，不能推就敷衍应付。譬如有的学校提出某种干部在生产岗位上究竟做些什么工作，做好这些工作必须具备那些理论知识和操作技能等问题，要求有关厂矿企业来解答；但后者往往不是深入工地、车间，吸收有关人员，根据现实生产技术情况，认真地加以研究，告诉学校。有的甚至推来推去，很长时间没有答案。即使勉强弄出一个答案，其参考价值也是很成问题的。还有有的学校为了一件资料或一项实习，往往和厂矿再三磋商，还是没有结果，最后不得不由双方负责同志亲自洽谈，问题才得到解决。
    应该承认，厂矿确实存在着一些具体困难。譬如学校索取资料图表，由于保密制度、保密标准很难掌握，就不大容易处理。又如生产实习的人数、次数过多，是会增加麻烦、影响生产的。食宿的安排，工具、材料、保护品的筹办，也是需要花费许多时间的。而且人身安全得格外注意，机器保护也得格外小心，这些都是需要好好考虑的。尤其是厂矿任务很紧，干部很少，没有专门机构和干部来配合学校共同工作，困难也确实很多。因此不大愿意接受学校师生来厂矿实习，或者存在着能少来就少来，最好是不来的心理。
    在这种情形下面，学校和厂矿都有些强调自己本身的任务，注意自己本身的困难，希望对方多协助，多照顾；而体谅对方的实际情况，尽量解决对方的问题，满足对方的要求，就注意得不够。这样双方就不容易凑拢，即使把关系建立起来，也难以持久。譬如生产实习，学校认为既是教学过程中的一个有机组成部分，是学习苏联先进经验的重要环节，那么，厂矿就应该积极协助，保证做好——多容纳实习学生，多让他们动手操作，多派技术人员讲解指导；即使因此而影响生产任务的完成，也是可以允许的。选择实习场所也多半面向大厂矿或先进厂矿，一提到水力发电，谁都想到丰满；一说搜集资料，什么都想看，都想要。不太考虑厂矿的力量和实际困难。厂矿方面则希望通过生产实习来解决自己的某些技术问题，希望学校提出革新建议，希望学校多做些专门报告。至于学校是不是能够办到，就考虑得不够。这都是不对的。
    最后，学校和厂矿的联系，毕竟是一件新的工作，经验、办法还不多。有的厂矿根本不了解学校是怎样进行工作的，当然更不知道怎样来协助。像组织生产实习的一套办法——拟定实习提纲、实习计划，作好事前准备工作以及现场组织领导、写实习日记、作实习报告等等，不仅许多厂矿没有经验，就连学校也不是那么熟悉的。
    以上这些问题，应该采取有效的办法来解决，否则，培养新型技术人才的事业，将会受到严重影响。
    怎样来解决这些问题呢？我的初步意见是：
    一、学校必须明确认识：大力争取厂矿的协助和支持，主动和厂矿联系，是搞好教学的关键。因此要很好地了解和研究有那些困难在阻碍着双方联系的加强，以便和厂矿共同设法克服，积极创造有利条件，使双方的联系密切起来。应该注意，不要只是向厂矿提出要求，要尽可能地给予厂矿一些帮助。比方了解厂矿生产技术上的问题，加以研究；使生产实习尽量有利于生产（在这方面已经有很多成功的例证。有的在不降低实习质量的情况下，协助厂矿提前完成了任务，有的发现了生产上的问题而提出很多合理化建议，有的解决了某些技术问题）；帮助厂矿技术人员提高理论水平，总结先进经验等等。这样才能达到互助两利，使彼此的关系密切起来。
    厂矿干部必须明确认识：学校是培养干部的地方，厂矿是使用干部的地方，学校培养的干部是不是合乎标准，将会直接影响厂矿的生产任务。厂矿的生产实践是无限丰富的教材，如果厂矿不提供资料，不重视生产实习，学校教学就缺乏生动的内容，培养出来的人才就不能合乎规格。因此，为了国家的社会主义工业化，为了厂矿本身的生产任务，为了保证所培养的人才的质量，厂矿应该给学校以具体帮助，给学校在自己厂矿进行工作的各种便利，尤其是生产实习，应该和学校共同保证作好。
    二、仅仅在思想上有了明确的认识是不够的，还必须在有关的问题上定出一定的制度，必须对某些具体困难予以适当解决，这才能为学校和厂矿的密切联系打下有利的基础。拿生产实习来说，学校和厂矿经常在这件事情上打交道，那就需要在生产实习规程这类文件上明确指出，这是双方共同的任务，并规定双方的责任，各自应该做些什么，如何去做。这样，有关领导部门在布置某一厂矿的年度任务时，就可以把接受生产实习这一工作考虑在内。另外，厂矿要根据情况，酌量设置指导生产实习的专门机构，配备专职或兼职干部，编造一定的经费预算。苏联的作法是：厂矿如果接受的实习师生超过了五十人，就设一个专职干部；兼职人员也另给适当的酬劳金，以资鼓励。这样有人、有钱，又有章则制度可循，再加上领导方面的重视，那就好办了。
    三、必须建立供给资料制度。目前在这方面最大的问题，一是保密，一是厂矿无人负责搜集和主动向学校提供资料。关于前者，我认为只要健全保密制度，堵塞了泄密漏洞，则凡是教学上必需的资料，都应供给。譬如可以采用这样一种方法，学校派师生到厂矿去做某一特定实习项目，或搜集某一教材及专题的资料，只要与其有关的，都可以让看，让记，让描。但如带走，则不论是原稿或自己的抄稿，均须大体划分不同的机密程度，经过一定机构批准，或经过保密系统交到学校保密室。当然，学校也必须建立和健全保密机构、保密制度，以保证不致失密、泄密。关于后者，学校要勤于提出所需资料的内容，常和厂矿联系，再加上厂矿的专门机构或专职、兼职干部的注意，那大体就可以解决问题了。
    四、大力介绍厂矿和学校密切联系、互助两利的具体经验及做法。譬如生产实习，既然这是一件新的工作，大家都不熟悉，那就应该详细介绍学校和厂矿领导生产实习的工作经验及先进方法，以便使大家有所取法，少走弯路。
    五、学校和厂矿彼此都应尽量估计到对方的工作任务，要互相协助，有困难共同解决。双方都不要提出过高要求。每一次生产实习结束后，双方都可以研究一下，那一种做法对双方都有利，以推广好的，批评坏的，这会有助于学校和厂矿的密切联系。
    六、建立联系制度。当然，要在全国各学校和全国各厂矿普遍建立联系，那是不可能的，也是不必要的，可根据学校所设专业性质和有关厂矿分别建立。也就是说，一个学校可以和一两个相应的厂矿互相密切联系，对于学校来说，厂矿好像起着实习工厂的作用，对于厂矿来说，学校好像起着自己的技术研究所的作用。双方都把应做的工作列入计划，提出保证。这样学校的教学和科学研究都可以和厂矿的实际结合起来；厂矿可以使实际操作的经验得到理论性的总结，可以提高技术水平。目前有的学校和厂矿已签订合作合同，这是值得推广的。自然，这项工作也需要有领导地来进行，否则，把这种联系集中于少数先进厂矿或大厂矿，使其承担任务过重，实际上会流于形式的。
