International Public Opinion Welcomes the Opening of the Geneva Conference
Negotiated Solutions to Asia's Urgent Problems Are Essential

The Korean "Nodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 26th commenting on the Geneva Conference, saying: Today, the eyes of all peace-loving people around the world are focused on Geneva. The historic conference of the five major powers and other relevant countries, aimed at resolving the most pressing issues in Asia—the Korean issue and the Indochina issue—through negotiation, opens today in Geneva.

The editorial pointed out: The convening of the Geneva Conference shows that it is possible to resolve the Korean issue and the Indochina issue through negotiation. If all countries participating in this conference have the sincerity to ease international tensions and respect the interests of the Asian people, these pressing Asian issues can be reasonably resolved. The editorial emphasized: In particular, the participation of the great Asian country, the People's Republic of China, alongside the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States, will greatly contribute to the peaceful resolution of Asian issues and the easing of international tensions.

The editorial pointed out: The resolution of the Korean issue must conform to the will of the Korean people and must restore peace and unification in Korea on a democratic basis. This is the only reasonable path to resolving the Korean issue. The editorial believes that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is not only in the interests of the Korean people but also of great significance to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. For this reason, peace-loving people all over the world ardently hope that Korea will achieve consolidated peace and are waging a resolute struggle for this. However, the US ruling clique fears peace and attempts to obstruct the easing of tensions in Asia.

The editorial concluded: The Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, expect the Geneva Conference to achieve success.

Those Who Advocate War Will Become Increasingly Isolated

Polish newspapers have been commenting extensively on the Geneva Conference. Newspapers have published editorials and reports from special correspondents stationed in Geneva.

"People's Tribune" said in an editorial: "The Geneva Conference is particularly important because, after the Berlin Conference, it represents a further step in the realization of the principle of negotiation; because, despite attempts to sabotage it, the People's China has finally achieved its rightful status as a world power; and finally, because this conference is discussing issues relating to recently ended and ongoing wars. For this reason, although the Geneva Conference nominally only discusses Far Eastern issues, it actually has a great impact on the overall international situation, on the consolidation of peace, and on the overall development of the struggle to ease international tensions."

"People's Tribune" pointed out that undoubtedly, the forces of aggression, despite their defeats, will continue to use their maximum strength to hinder the realization of peace in the Far East. However, those who advocate a "global strategy" are becoming increasingly isolated, and the voices of the people of all countries calling for a peaceful resolution of international disputes are growing stronger, which enables the conference to play an important role in resolving the tasks it faces. The people of the whole world have the right to hope that those participating in the Geneva Conference will complete their tasks and peacefully resolve the Far Eastern issue.

"Freedom Fighter" wrote in an editorial: "The Geneva Conference will undoubtedly be one of the most important international events since the war." The newspaper wrote, "This conference has a universal importance that goes far beyond the scope of Asian issues." "Undoubtedly, this conference will have an important impact on the normalization of international relations worldwide and on further easing international tensions. Despite the frenzied activities of the aggressive bloc, it seems possible and necessary to conduct negotiations between countries with different social systems and different foreign policy principles. We believe that this will inevitably affect the further expansion of international cultural and trade exchanges and will help to strengthen the common and profound belief of millions of people: that no international dispute cannot be resolved peacefully."

"Voice of Labor" wrote: "In observing the Geneva Conference, we must remember its background, must remember the powerful will of the people of all countries who demand peace, a will that is forcing almost every newspaper in Western Europe, regardless of differing opinions, to oppose the adventurous policies of the United States and to demand an understanding in Geneva—an understanding based on the principle of respecting the sovereignty and independent rights of every country and the principle that no international dispute cannot be resolved peacefully. The door to such an understanding was opened by the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Geneva Conference is the result of this policy."

Welcome China and Soviet Union's Efforts to Safeguard Peace

The Czechoslovakian "Red Rights" published an editorial on the 26th saying, "Peace-loving people see with great satisfaction and pride that the convening of the Geneva Conference itself proves how the wishes of peace-loving humanity have been and are being put into practice, so that disputes in the world can be resolved through international consultation and agreement, rather than through violent actions, wars, and atomic bombs."

The editorial praised the tireless efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all peace forces in the world to achieve a ceasefire in Korea and further ease international tensions. The editorial emphasized that every peace-loving person in the world knows that without the participation of China, with its 500 million people, problems in international relations cannot be truly resolved.

The editorial pointed out that the US monopoly capital group is attempting to disrupt the Geneva Conference and prevent it from proceeding smoothly; they still want to pursue their malicious policy of strength, which has been indignantly condemned by peace-loving humanity.

The editorial concluded: "Our people are striving to establish international friendly relations and hope that disputes in the world can be resolved through consultation and agreement, as the Soviet Union is striving to achieve. Therefore, they wholeheartedly welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference and hope that this conference will achieve victory in the effort to safeguard peace."

People of All Countries Expect Easing of Tensions

All newspapers in the democratic sector of Berlin prominently published on the 25th and 26th the written statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the airport upon his arrival in Geneva, as well as editorials and articles welcoming the opening of the Geneva Conference.

"Daily Review" wrote: "Despite the obstructionist policies pursued by Western countries, especially the United States, the conference of the five major powers was finally able to be held in Geneva, which once again clearly demonstrates the strength of the worldwide peace movement. The great and strong People's Republic of China participated in this conference with the same rights as other major powers. Even if Washington attempts to deny this fact, China's participation still signifies the recognition of China's status as a world power." "Daily Review" also pointed out that the People's Republic of China represents not only its own interests at the Geneva Conference but also the interests of the people of other Asian countries.

"Young World" pointed out that an agreement among the major powers on the peace in Korea and the end of the war in Indochina would help maintain peace throughout the world, as this would ease tense international relations. The newspaper wrote: "We Germans have fervent expectations for the Geneva Conference because the easing of international tensions will help resolve the German issue and various issues of European security."

"Morning Post" commented: "It is only natural that we Germans pay close attention to this conference. Because we know that the resolution of various outstanding issues, especially the easing of international tensions, will have a positive impact on the resolution of the German issue."

"National Daily" said: "The will of the people of all countries can make any undertaking succeed. Their unity in decisive actions can make the Geneva Conference a success."

The Convening of the Conference is a Victory for Peace Forces

Indonesian newspapers welcomed the convening of the Geneva Conference. Jakarta's "People's Daily" said on the 26th that the opening of the Geneva Conference will write an extremely important page in world history. The convening of the Geneva Conference is a victory for peace forces. The newspaper listed some facts to show that the United States had been desperately trying to obstruct the convening of the conference in the past few weeks. The newspaper said that the Indonesian people will closely monitor the progress of the conference and oppose any conspiracy to disrupt the conference. They will do everything possible to defend world peace and avoid another war.

"Indonesia News" published an editorial on the 26th saying: The Geneva Conference will discuss Far Eastern issues related to the overall international situation, among which the most pressing is the Indochina issue. The newspaper said that the resolution of the Indochina issue is inseparable from the peace issue and the anti-colonial system issue facing Asian countries.

"East Star" quoted observers in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, as saying: "The convening of the Geneva Conference will help fulfill the United Nations Charter, which aims to maintain world peace." The observer condemned the US policy, saying: While the whole world is eager to establish lasting peace, the United States is carrying out various threatening and intimidating activities.

    各国舆论欢迎日内瓦会议开幕
    必须协商解决亚洲的迫切问题
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”二十六日发表社论评论日内瓦会议说：今天，全世界爱好和平人民的视线，都集中在日内瓦。以协商的方式解决目前亚洲最迫切的问题——朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的五大国和其他有关国家参加的历史性会议，今天在日内瓦开幕了。
    社论指出：日内瓦会议的召开表明，以协商的方式解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题是可能的。如果参加这个会议的所有国家都具有缓和国际紧张局势和尊重亚洲人民利益的诚意，亚洲的这些迫切问题便可以获得合理的解决。社论强调指出：特别是亚洲的伟大国家中华人民共和国和苏联、法国、英国、美国一起参加这个会议，对亚洲问题的和平解决和国际紧张局势的缓和会有莫大的贡献。
    社论指出：朝鲜问题的解决，必须符合朝鲜人民的意志，必须在民主的基础上恢复朝鲜的和平与统一。这是解决朝鲜问题的唯一的合理的道路。社论认为：朝鲜问题的和平解决不仅符合朝鲜人民的利益，而且对巩固亚洲及世界的和平有着巨大的意义。正因为如此，全世界爱好和平的人民热烈希望朝鲜获得巩固的和平，并为此而进行着坚决的斗争。但是，美国统治集团却害怕和平，企图阻挠亚洲紧张局势的缓和。
    社论最后说：朝鲜人民和世界和平人民一起，期望着日内瓦会议获得成就。
    鼓吹战争的人将越来越孤立
    波兰各报纷纷评论日内瓦会议。各报刊载了社论和驻日内瓦特派记者的报道。
    “人民论坛报”在社论中说：“日内瓦会议之所以特别重要，是因为在柏林会议以后，它在协商原则的实现上又进了一步；是因为尽管有人千方百计地进行破坏，人民中国终于取得了应有的世界大国的地位；最后，还因为这次会议讨论的是关于刚结束的战争和仍在进行的战争的问题。正因为如此，所以日内瓦会议虽然在名义上只讨论远东问题，实际上它对于整个国际局势、对于巩固和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争的总的发展有很大影响。”
    “人民论坛报”指出，无疑的，侵略势力尽管遭到了失败，仍将继续用最大力量来阻挠在远东实现和平。但是，鼓吹“全球战略”的人越来越孤立，各国人民要求和平解决国际争端的呼声越来越强，这就使得会议在解决它所面临的任务中能够发挥重要的作用。全世界人民都有权利希望参加日内瓦会议的人们完成他们的任务，和平解决远东问题。
    “自由战士”报在社论中说：“日内瓦会议无疑将是战后最重要的国际事件之一。”该报写道，“这次会议具有普遍的重要性，其重要性大大超出了亚洲问题的范围。” “无疑的，这次会议对于全世界范围内国际关系的正常化，对于进一步大大缓和国际紧张局势将有重要的影响。尽管侵略集团在疯狂地活动，但是，在社会制度不同、外交政策原则不同的国家之间进行谈判，看来又是可能而且必要的了。我们相信这必然会影响到国际的文化和贸易交流的进一步扩大、必然会有助于加强千百万人民一个共同的深刻信念：任何国际争端是没有不能和平解决的。”
    “劳动之声”报写道：“在注视日内瓦会议的时候，我们必须记住它的背景，必须记住各国人民要求和平的强大意志，这种意志正迫使西欧国家几乎每一种不同意见的报纸反对美国的冒险政策，要求在日内瓦获得谅解——以尊重每一国家的主权和独立权利的原则以及任何国际争端没有不能和平解决的原则为基础的谅解。通向这种谅解的门是苏联和中华人民共和国的和平政策打开的。日内瓦会议就是这种政策的结果。”
    欢迎中苏两国保卫和平的努力
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”二十六日发表社论说，“爱好和平的人民怀着十分满意和骄傲的心情看到，召开日内瓦会议这件事本身就证明，爱好和平的人类的愿望在过去和现在，是在如何地付诸实现，以使世界上的争端可以通过国际协商和协议的方式，而不是通过暴力行动、战争和原子弹而得到解决。”
    社论称赞苏联、中华人民共和国与全世界和平力量为实现朝鲜停战和进一步缓和国际紧张局势而作的不倦努力。社论强调说：世界上每一个爱好和平的人都会知道，如果没有拥有五亿人口的中国参加，国际关系中的问题就不能得到真正的解决。
    社论指出，美国垄断资本集团企图破坏日内瓦会议，使之不能顺利进行，他们仍然想奉行他们的恶意的、为爱好和平的人类所愤慨地谴责了的实力政策。
    社论最后说：“我国人民正在竭力争取建立国际友好关系，并希望世界上的争端可以像苏联所努力争取的那样，通过协商和协议的方式予以解决。因此，他们衷心欢迎日内瓦会议召开，希望这个会议在为争取保卫和平而作的努力中得到胜利。”
    各国人民期望缓和紧张局势
    柏林民主区所有的报纸在二十五日和二十六日都以显著地位刊载周恩来外长抵日内瓦后在机场所发表的书面声明，以及欢迎日内瓦会议开幕的社论与文章。
    “每日评论”写道：“尽管西方国家，尤其是美国，奉行阻挠政策，然而五大国的会议终于得以在日内瓦召开，这又一次清楚地证明了全世界和平运动力量的强大。伟大而强盛的中华人民共和国以和其他大国权利平等的地位参加了这一会议。即使华盛顿企图不承认这件事实，中国的参加仍然表示中国作为一个世界大国的地位得到了承认。”“每日评论”并指出，中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上不仅代表它本国的利益，而且也代表亚洲其他各国人民的利益。
    “青年世界”指出，各大国在有关朝鲜的和平以及结束印度支那战争的问题上达成协议，将会有助于维护全世界的和平，因为这将缓和紧张的国际关系。该报写道：“我们德国人对于日内瓦会议抱着殷切的期望，因为国际紧张关系的缓和将有助于解决德国问题以及欧洲安全的各种问题。”
    “晨报”评论说：“我们德国人密切地注意这一次会议应该说是理所当然的。因为我们知道：各种悬而未决的问题的解决，首先是国际紧张关系的缓和，对于解决德国问题将会发生有利的影响。”
    “国民日报”说：“各国人民的意志能够使任何事业成功。他们在具有决定意义的行动上团结一致，就能使日内瓦会议成功。”
    会议的召开是和平力量的胜利
    印度尼西亚报纸欢迎日内瓦会议的召开。雅加达“人民日报”二十六日说，日内瓦会议的开幕，在世界历史上将写下极重要的一页。召开日内瓦会议是和平力量的胜利。该报列举了一些事实，说明在过去几星期中，美国在拚命阻挠会议的召开。该报说，印尼人民将密切地注视着会议的进展，并反对任何破坏会议的阴谋。他们将尽一切力量来保卫世界和平与避免另外一次战争。
    “印尼新闻报”二十六日发表社论说：日内瓦会议将讨论有关整个国际局势的远东问题，其中最迫切的是印度支那问题。该报说，印度支那问题的解决，是和亚洲国家所面临的和平问题与反对殖民制度问题分不开的。
    “东星报”援引印尼首都雅加达的观察家的话说：“日内瓦会议的召开将有助于履行目的在维护世界和平的联合国宪章。”观察家谴责美国的政策，他说：当全世界渴望建立持久和平之时，美国却在进行种种威胁恫吓性的活动。（据新华社讯）
