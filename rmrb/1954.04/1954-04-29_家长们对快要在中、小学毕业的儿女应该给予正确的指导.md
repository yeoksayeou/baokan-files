Parents Should Give Correct Guidance to Their Children Who Are About to Graduate from Middle and Elementary School
Wei Que

The summer vacation is approaching, and parents are concerned about what their children should do after graduating from elementary and junior high school. Many parents hope that their children can continue their education. This year, some elementary and junior high school graduates will be able to continue their studies; however, due to the limited enrollment quotas in junior high schools, senior high schools, and other secondary schools, it will be impossible for all elementary and junior high school graduates to continue their education for a considerable period of time in the future. To correctly understand this issue, it should be examined from all aspects.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our primary and secondary schools have greatly developed. In 1949, there were more than 24.39 million primary school students, which increased to more than 55 million in 1952, an increase of about 1.3 times. In 1949, there were more than 1.27 million secondary school students, which increased to more than 3.28 million by the end of 1952, an increase of almost 1.6 times. Judging from these figures, secondary schools have developed more than primary schools, which gives elementary school graduates more opportunities to continue their education. At the same time, in order to enable secondary schools, especially junior high schools and senior high schools, to accommodate more students, the People's Government has taken various measures to increase the capacity of schools as much as possible, such as expanding the number of students in each class, increasing the number of classes, implementing a two-shift system, running night middle schools, attaching middle school classes to rural complete primary schools, and maximizing the potential of teachers. However, despite this, it still cannot meet the growing demand for further education from elementary and junior high school graduates year by year. Some parents have asked: Why doesn't the state establish more junior high schools and senior high schools to accommodate all elementary and junior high school graduates?

We must consider this issue from the perspective of the overall task of the country during the transition period. Our motherland is now fighting to realize the country's socialist industrialization. The central link in realizing the country's socialist industrialization is the development of heavy industry. The development of heavy industry requires a lot of funds. Therefore, the development of our schools at all levels, including junior high schools and senior high schools, must have certain limits. Only in this way can it meet the requirements of the country's overall task during the transition period.

Is this approach correct? We can learn by looking at the path taken by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union only implemented elementary compulsory education in rural areas thirteen years after the October Revolution, that is, from 1930, and promoted junior high school compulsory education in cities and industrial and mining areas. As for popularizing junior high school education in rural areas and popularizing senior high school education in cities and industrial and mining areas, it was proposed in 1939 after socialist construction had been completed, and it was not fully realized until 1953.

From this, it seems that the popularization of elementary education and secondary education can only be realized when socialist construction has reached a certain level. That is to say, the implementation of universal education must have a certain level of production as a foundation. In recent years, our production has developed greatly; however, at present, our country is still an agricultural country. If we now demand that all elementary and junior high school graduates be able to continue their education, it is not commensurate with our production development, especially with the basic task of concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry as stipulated in the first five-year plan, and therefore it is impossible.

Some people think that elementary and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education have no future. This view is wrong. Building socialism requires culture. These graduates have a cultural foundation of elementary and junior high school. Participating in production and other construction work is of great help to socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Their future is very broad. Let me give some examples to prove it.

Last year, more than 49,000 elementary school graduates in Liaoxi Province participated in agricultural production. They played a significant role in production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, grain purchase, general election work, and the propaganda of the general task. Many of them have become skilled workers in production; some have also become mutual aid team leaders, accountants, cooperative accountants, etc. Xu Jianchun, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Hou Lü Village, Guoxi District, Yexian County, Shandong Province, is now a well-known labor model in the province. Her example greatly encourages elementary school graduates in rural areas throughout the province and serves as their role model. Some elementary school graduates have also become village cadres or teachers in people's schools, etc. In Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, 66 elementary school graduates were elected as village cadres and people's representatives last year. According to statistics from eleven districts in Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, eleven elementary school graduates last year have become labor models, twenty-six have become village cadres, and one hundred and seventy-four have been hired as teachers in people's schools. In Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, more than 20 elementary school graduates participated in agricultural production: some served as accountants and cashiers for production teams; some served as assistants to tractor drivers; some served as deputy political team leaders, secretaries of the Communist Youth League branch, teachers in people's schools, propagandists, and librarians.

Elementary school graduates in rural areas also spread agricultural science and technology, such as scientific seed selection, advanced farming methods, and the use of pesticides. Farmers reflected: Now that we have literate people, we don’t have to worry about learning advanced experience. Elementary school graduates in rural areas also formed troupes, enlivening cultural and recreational activities in rural areas.

In short, elementary school graduates participating in agricultural production are very popular among farmers, and their progress is also very rapid.

Now let's look at examples of junior high school students participating in industrial production. For example, Xu GuoFan, a female worker in a flax mill, has been promoted to “assistant technician” after two years of hard study, learning many techniques from skilled workers and Soviet experts. She can now operate four machines and do preliminary repair work. She united all 17 workers in the group to participate in the competition, and won the first-class red flag in November last year. Another example is Yan Qiming, a second-level technician in a factory, who improved tools when manufacturing parts, creating "one knife with three heads and nine blades," which increased work efficiency by three times and guaranteed 100% quality. He also promoted high-speed cutting methods and found sixteen tricks in the increase production and saving movement. He was named a labor model in the Northeast region and was elected as a people's representative of the district in the general election. Another factory absorbed 100 junior high school students in 1950. By last year, most of them had become foremen, technicians, dispatchers, inspectors, and construction workers, becoming the backbone of the factory; a few had even become workshop directors.

There are many good examples of elementary and junior high school graduates participating in production and construction. The above are just some of them. From these examples, we can appreciate that their participation in production or other construction work can play a great positive role in improving labor productivity, which is conducive to socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Precisely because of this, their future is very promising.

Based on the above analysis, I hope that parents can correctly guide and help their children who are about to graduate from elementary and junior high school.

First, parents should understand that it is a glorious thing for their children to participate in production or other construction work after graduating from elementary and junior high school. Some parents think that it is “shameful” for their children to participate in production labor, which is wrong. All our means of production and living materials are created by labor. The fields and cities of our great motherland were opened up and built by our ancestors, mainly the working people. The long-standing and brilliant culture of our great motherland is the labor result of our ancestors, especially the working people, over thousands of years. Since the establishment of the people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the working people in our country have been greatly improved, and therefore there have been many inventions in production and many brilliant examples have been created. All of this shows that participating in labor and being workers and farmers is very glorious.

Second, I hope parents can understand that continuing education is just a step from one stage of education to another, not the purpose of education. The purpose of our school education is to cultivate well-rounded new people, to cultivate young people into conscious and active builders of socialist society, and to become defenders of the motherland. In other words, our purpose in educating children and young people is to make them actively participate in socialist construction and defend the motherland.

As for whether a child or young person should transfer from one stage of education to another, it depends not only on personal wishes and admission conditions, but more importantly on the national construction plan. An individual has the conditions for admission, but according to the national construction plan, the number of students enrolled in schools is limited, so many people cannot continue their education. Parents should have a realistic attitude to deal with the issue of their children's further education.

It should be pointed out that children who do not continue their education but participate in production or other construction work can also be cultivated into useful talents for the country in practical work, and can continue to improve their cultural level through spare-time study. National well-known labor models such as Li Shunda and Wang Chonglun have grown up from practical work and spare-time study. We must also see that in the new society, as long as workers and farmers are willing to work hard in production and study hard, and constantly improve their cultural and scientific and technological level, they can also be transformed from ordinary workers and farmers into experts or engineers.

Third, I hope that parents can explain the above points to their children who have failed to continue their education, and encourage and help them to participate in production or other construction work. They should not be blamed for failing the exam. Moreover, they should not exert any pressure before or after the exam, or give their children a mental blow.

If the parents are farmers, they can let their children go home to work in production, promote the agricultural cooperative movement and other rural construction undertakings. Some people, due to their lack of understanding of the importance of agriculture and the bright future of agricultural development, believe that farming is not promising and are unwilling to let their children return home to participate in agricultural production, which is wrong.

According to the provisions of the basic task of the country's first five-year plan, while concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry, agriculture must be developed accordingly. Why? Because in the process of industrial development, we need more food to supply the workers and more raw materials to supply industrial manufacturing. At the same time, people's lives have improved, and more food and industrial products are needed. The future of agricultural development is the future of agricultural collectivization and mechanization. Since agriculture is so important, and the future of agricultural development is so bright and great, why not let children participate in agricultural production?

If the family is in the city, parents can mobilize their children to go to the factory to learn to work if the local factory needs to recruit students. But we must also see that our factory capacity is currently limited and cannot absorb many students for a while. Therefore, if children cannot continue their education or find employment, parents have the responsibility to urge them to study at home and provide them with various conveniences for self-study. At the same time, if possible, parents can also take the lead in organizing the masses to run schools themselves to help the People's Government solve the learning problems of some children and young people.

The state has the responsibility to educate the younger generation. Parents also have the responsibility to educate their children. The common task of the state and parents is to cultivate the younger generation into conscious and active builders of socialist society and defenders of the great motherland. At present, many children have some confused thoughts about the purpose of education and the issues of continuing education and employment. Parents should help schools and the government to strengthen political and ideological education for children, improve their socialist consciousness, overcome the erroneous ideas of despising labor and despising workers and peasants, so that they can recognize the socialist political direction, strengthen patriotism, labor viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, so that they can love the motherland, love labor, and love the people. If it is impossible to continue education after graduation, they should consciously participate in production labor or other construction work in accordance with the national construction plan. If it is impossible to participate in production for a while, they should concentrate on self-study at home and help the family with some things. I believe that the parents of the new generation in New China will accept this new idea and will educate and guide their children well in accordance with this new idea.

    家长们对快要在中、小学毕业的儿女应该给予正确的指导
    韦悫
    暑假快到了，家长们正关心着儿女在高小和初中毕业后应该怎样办的问题。许多家长希望儿女毕业后能够升学。今年也有一部分高小和初中毕业生能够升学；但是由于初中、高中和其它中等学校的招生名额有限，今后在一个相当长的时期内，高小和初中毕业生是不可能全部升学的。要正确认识这个问题，应该从各方面加以考察。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们的小学和中学已经有了很大的发展。一九四九年小学生有二千四百三十九万多人，一九五二年增加到五千五百多万人，增加约一点三倍。一九四九年中等学校学生有一百二十七万多人，一九五二年底增加到三百二十八万多人，增加了差不多一点六倍。从这些数字看来，中等学校发展得比小学还多，这就给予高小毕业生以更多的升学机会。同时，为了使中等学校，特别是初中和高中，能够容纳更多的学生，人民政府已尽可能采取各种办法来增加学校的容量，如扩充每班的名额、增加班次、实行二部制、举办夜中学、在农村完全小学附设中学班、发挥教师潜力等等。但是，尽管如此，仍然不能满足逐年增长的高小和初中毕业生的升学要求。曾经有家长这样问：国家为什么不办更多的初级中学和高级中学来收容所有高小和初中毕业生呢？
    我们要从国家在过渡时期的总任务来考虑这个问题。我们的祖国，现在正在为实现国家的社会主义工业化而斗争。实现国家社会主义工业化的中心环节是发展重工业。发展重工业需要大量的资金，因此，我们各级学校的发展，包括初中和高中的发展，也就须要有一定的限度。只有这样做，才符合国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求。
    这样作对不对呢？只要看看苏联所走过的道路就可以知道了。苏联在十月革命后十三年，即从一九三○年起才在农村实行初等义务教育，在城市和工矿区推行初中义务教育。至于在农村普及初中教育和城市与工矿区普及高中教育，是在社会主义建设已经完成以后的一九三九年提出的，到一九五三年才完全实现。
    这样看来，普及初等教育和中学教育是要在社会主义建设达到一定程度的时候，才可能实现。这就是说，实行普及教育要有一定的生产水平作为基础。几年以来，我们的生产已有很大的发展；但是，目前我国还是一个农业国。如果我们现在要求所有高小和初中毕业生都能够升学，那是和我们的生产发展情况不相称，特别是和第一个五年计划所规定的集中主要力量发展重工业的基本任务不符合的，因而是办不到的。
    有人以为，不能升学的高小和初中毕业生没有前途，这种看法是不对的。建设社会主义需要有文化。这些毕业生有了高小和初中的文化基础，去参加生产和其他建设工作，对于社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，是有很大帮助的。他们的前途是十分广阔的。让我举些例子来证明。
    辽西省去年有四万九千多高小毕业生参加农业生产，他们在生产、互助合作运动、购粮、普选工作、总任务宣传等方面，都起了很大的作用。他们很多成为生产上的能手；有些还当了互助组组长、计账员、合作社会计等等。山东掖县过西区后吕村的女青年团员徐建春现在是全省知名的劳动模范。她的事例给全省农村高小毕业生很大的鼓舞，成为他们的榜样。还有一些高小毕业生已经成为乡村的干部或民校教员等等。山东郓城县去年高小毕业生当了乡村干部和人民代表的就有六十六人。据山东荣城县十一个区的统计，去年的高小毕业生有十一人已成为劳动模范，二十六人做了乡村干部，一百七十四人被聘为民学教师。河北饶阳县五公村有二十多个高小毕业生参加了农业生产：有的当了生产队的会计、出纳；有的当了拖拉机驾驶员的助手；有的做了政治副队长、团支部书记、民校教员、宣传员和图书员。
    高小毕业生在农村还传播了农业科学技术，如科学选种、先进耕作方法、使用杀虫药等。农民反映：这回有了识字的人，我们学习先进经验可就不愁了。农村高小毕业生还成立了剧团，活跃了农村的文化娱乐活动。
    总而言之，高小毕业生参加农业生产，很受农民的欢迎，他们的进步也是很快的。
    现在让我们看看初中生参加工业生产的例子。如某亚麻厂的女工徐国璠，经过了两年的努力学习，向熟练工人和苏联专家学到许多技术，现已升为“助技”，已能掌握四台机器，并能做初步的修理工作。她团结全组十七个工人参加竞赛，去年十一月份得到了一等红旗。又如某厂的二级技工阎启明在制造零件时曾改进了工具，创造了“一刀三头九刃”，提高了工作效率三倍，保证了百分之百的质量。他还推广了高速切削法，并在增产节约运动中，找到了十六个窍门。他被评为东北区劳动模范，普选时被选为区人民代表。还有某厂在一九五○年曾吸收了一百名初中生，到去年大多数已做了工长、技术员、调度员、检查员、施工员，成为该厂的骨干；个别的还当了车间主任。
    高小和初中毕业生参加生产建设的好例子还有很多。这里所列举的只是其中的一些而已。从这些例子看来，我们可以体会到他们参加生产或其它建设工作，对提高劳动生产率能够起很大的积极作用，是有利于社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的。正因为这样，他们的前途是很远大的。
    根据上面的分析，我希望家长们能够正确地指导和帮助快要在高小和初中毕业的儿女。
    第一、家长们要了解，儿女在高小和初中毕业后去参加生产或其它建设工作，是一件光荣的事情。有些家长认为儿女参加生产劳动是“丢人”的事情，这是不对的。我们的一切生产工具和生活资料，都是靠劳动创造出来的。我们伟大祖国的田园和城市，都是我们的祖先，主要是劳动人民，开辟和建设的。我们伟大祖国的悠久的、光辉灿烂的文化是我们的祖先，特别是劳动人民，几千年以来的劳动成果。自从工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权建立以来，我国劳动人民的政治觉悟和生产积极性是大大提高了，因而在生产上有不少的发明，创造了许多光辉的事例。这一切都说明参加劳动，当工人和农民是十分光荣的事。
    第二、希望家长们能够了解，升学只是从一个教育阶段到另一个教育阶段的步骤，而不是教育的目的。我们学校教育的目的是培养全面发展的新人，培养青年成为社会主义社会的自觉的、积极的建设者，成为祖国的保卫者。换句话说，我们教育儿童和青年的目的是为了要他们积极参加社会主义建设，保卫祖国。
    至于一个儿童或青年是否应由一个教育阶段转移到另一个教育阶段，那不单决定于个人的愿望和升学条件，更主要的是决定于国家的建设计划。个人具备升学条件，而按照国家建设计划，学校招生的名额有限，就有很多人不能升学。家长要有实事求是的态度，去对待儿女的升学问题。
    应该指出，儿女不升学而参加生产或其它建设工作，也可以在实际工作中培养成为国家的有用人才，并可通过业余学习继续不断地提高文化水平。全国闻名的李顺达、王崇伦等劳动模范就是从实际工作和业余学习中成长起来的。还要看到一点，就是在新社会里，工人农民只要肯努力生产努力学习，不断提高自己的文化和科学技术水平，他们还可以由普通工农变成专家或工程师的。
    第三、希望家长能对未能升学的儿女，参考上面所讲各点向他们解释，并鼓励和帮助他们参加生产或其它建设工作。切不应因为他们考不取，加以责备。更不应在考试前或考不取后，施以任何压力，给子女精神上以打击。
    家长是种地的，就可以让儿女回家生产。推动农业合作运动和其它农村建设事业。有些人由于不了解农业的重要性和农业发展的光明前途，认为种地没有出息，不愿意儿女回家参加农业生产，这是不对的。
    根据国家第一个五年计划基本任务的规定，在集中主要力量发展重工业的同时，必须相应地发展农业。为什么呢？因为在工业发展的过程中，我们需要更多的粮食来供给工人吃，要有更多的原料来供给工业制造用。同时人民生活改善了，又需要更多的粮食和工业产品。农业发展的前途是农业合作化、机械化的前途。农业既然这样重要，农业发展的前途又这样光明和伟大，为什么不让儿女参加农业生产呢？
    家在城市，如果当地工厂需要招收学生，那家长就可以动员子女去工厂学工。但也要看到目前我们的工厂容量有限，一时还吸收不了许多学生。因此，如果儿女既不能升学，又不能就业，家长就有责任督促他们在家自修，并给他们以自修的种种便利。同时家长如有可能，还可带头组织群众自己办学，以帮助人民政府解决一部分儿女和青少年的学习问题。
    国家负有教育年轻一代的责任。父母同样负有教育儿女的责任。国家和父母的共同任务，就是把年轻一代培养成为社会主义社会的自觉的积极的建设者和伟大祖国的保卫者。当前有很多孩子由于不明白受教育的目的，为着升学和就业问题产生了一些混乱思想。做父母的就应该帮助学校、帮助政府，对孩子们加强政治思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，克服轻视劳动、轻视工农的错误思想，使他们认识社会主义的政治方向，加强爱国主义思想、劳动观点和群众观点，使他们热爱祖国，热爱劳动，热爱人民。在毕业后如不可能升学，就按照国家建设计划，自觉地去参加生产劳动或其他建设工作。如果一时不可能参加生产，就安心在家努力自学，并帮助家庭做些事情。我相信新中国年轻一代的父母，是会接受这一新思想的，并会按照这一新思想来很好地教育和指导自己的孩子的。
