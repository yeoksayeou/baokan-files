    The bloody rule and colonial wars of the French colonialists and their puppet regimes have caused the people in French-occupied Indochina to live a miserable and impoverished life for a long time.
    In order to implement the trick of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," the French aggressors turned all urban and rural areas under their control into cannon fodder supply bases. The Bao Dai puppet regime announced the implementation of "compulsory" military service in June 1953; on April 12 this year, the so-called "wartime cabinet" issued a "general mobilization order" to all Vietnamese men aged 20 to 25. The Lao puppet regime also promulgated a so-called "general mobilization order" in April 1953 to conscript men between the ages of 18 and 35 and reserves into the puppet army to serve as cannon fodder. The Cambodian puppet regime has decided to implement compulsory military service for all Cambodian citizens between the ages of 21 and 35. In addition, in order to supplement the shortage of active troops, the French colonialists even more viciously grabbed men and conscripted laborers everywhere, arresting women and children under the age of fifteen, and even forcibly pulling monks into the puppet army. According to Bao Lu, the puppet prime minister of Bao Dai, the number of people forcibly conscripted into the puppet army in Vietnam has increased from 25,000 in 1949 to 206,000 in 1953. Recently, the Bao Dai puppet regime is preparing to step up the conscription, and plans to increase the puppet army to 550,000 this year.
    In order to further control its occupied areas and attempt to prevent the expansion of people's guerrilla warfare, the French aggressors began to implement "village consolidation" in the spring of 1953 on the edges of the occupied areas and along major transportation routes. "Large communes" were established in areas where the French invading forces could better control, and then the people from the surrounding villages were driven into the "large communes," and fascist "joint guarantee systems" were established. The French aggressors also used barbaric means to destroy the people's houses and crops, razed entire villages to the ground, and then forced the residents to concentrate in concentration camps surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers in order to force the people to join the puppet army or arbitrarily seize their property.
    The French invading forces carried out the "three-all policy" of killing all, burning all, and looting all everywhere, arresting hundreds of civilians and throwing them into the sea; slaughtering entire villages regardless of men, women, old and young; sawing prisoners into pieces of meat with saws, and hanging their heads in the streets for "public display." For example, in central Vietnam, the French invading forces forced many Vietnamese women to stand on the bridge, holding their children, facing the river, and then ordered them to throw their beloved children into the river; those who hesitated slightly were immediately shot dead by the French army. The most barbaric and shameless act was the ravaging of women. In the French-occupied areas, rapes occurred several times a day, and no one was spared from girls to 70-year-old women and even pregnant women. Countless women were gang-raped to death by the French invading forces, including Catholics and nuns. A secret order captured by the Vietnamese People's Army from the headquarters of the French invading forces stipulated that officers at all levels should carry out "collective rape" once a month in order to "boost morale."
    In the colonial war waged by the French invading forces in Indochina, crops were destroyed on a large scale, creating artificial famines. Wherever the French invading forces went, they burned rice fields and food, destroyed agricultural tools, and slaughtered or drove away livestock. When the rainy season came to Vietnam, the French invading forces destroyed the dikes and sluices of the Red River Delta, causing floods to submerge crops. In addition, they dispatched planes to indiscriminately bomb reservoirs and sluices in various places, and strafed and shot at farmers who were repairing them. French officer Chabert, who was captured by the Vietnamese People's Army, confessed: "The French military headquarters ordered the destruction of everything and the transformation of this area into scorched earth. This order was completely carried out. Every house and every hut was burned down. All livestock and poultry were slaughtered. The orchards were destroyed and every tree was cut down. The rice fields and mills were also set on fire. For several days the sky was full of black smoke, and nothing was left except French soldiers." An Austrian, Jogan Zimmerman, who served in the French invading forces and escaped, also said in a conversation:
  "I am a witness to the atrocities of the French occupation army in Indochina. Many special detachments burned villages and massacred all the residents."
    In the French-occupied areas, there were more prisons than schools, and more prisoners than students. On Con Dao Island in southern Vietnam alone, in addition to four large prisons each capable of holding about 1,000 people, there were countless small prisons scattered in the mountain jungles and labor camps. In this dark concentration camp, countless people were tortured to death. However, the education funds allocated by the French colonialists to the French-occupied areas accounted for only 0.5% of the total budget. Many schools were often closed under various pretexts. In Hanoi, tens of thousands of primary school graduates were unable to attend school due to expensive tuition fees and a lack of schools. In many schools in the city, 120 to 130 students were often crowded into a narrow, airless classroom. The illiteracy rate in the French-occupied areas was more than 90% of the population, and the illiteracy rate in the French-occupied areas of Laos was as high as 97%.
    The French colonialists and their lackeys are intensifying their exploitation of the Indochinese people in order to carry out colonial wars. Bao Lu, the puppet prime minister of Bao Dai, shamelessly boasted about the "contribution" of the traitors to the current war budget in Vietnam in a report to the so-called French Federal Conference in early March this year. According to his report, billions of piastres (Indochinese pseudo-currency) have been invested in the dirty colonial war, and another 3.5 billion piastres will be paid for the colonial war this year. For this purpose, the Bao Dai puppet regime has implemented endless exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Since 1953, the so-called "national defense" burden tax, water tax, market tax, etc. have been increased by more than double, and the head tax, livestock tax, land tax, etc. have also been continuously increased. In many cities, in addition to the dozens of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, many new taxes have been established last year under various pretexts: such as road sweeping tax, sewer tax, corridor tax, birth and death tax... and even a "window tax" forcibly levied according to the number of windows opened in the house. Even so, the Bao Dai puppet regime has a huge financial deficit and severe currency inflation. In May 1953, the pseudo-currency was devalued once, taking away about half of the money of the residents of the French-occupied areas. French government officials shamelessly said that the devaluation of the Indochinese pseudo-currency "can greatly reduce France's financial burden and enable France to intensify its operations in Indochina." Due to this devaluation of the pseudo-currency, prices in the French-occupied areas generally soared by 70% in one day; in Hanoi, prices more than doubled. According to statistics, from 1947 to 1953, prices in the French-occupied areas increased by 12 times, while wages increased by less than one time.
    The suffering of workers in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam has deepened under the barbaric persecution and exploitation of the French colonialists. The French colonialists concentrated their efforts to expand military repair factories and other factories directly related to their army, while peaceful industries and handicrafts were destroyed due to the flooding of the market with American and French goods. A large number of workers were collectively laid off, and the number of partially laid-off workers often reached 70% of the total number of workers. The number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, with an average of one in five workers unemployed. In Hanoi alone, half of the 200,000 wage laborers are unemployed. Working workers are overwhelmed by excessive labor, meager wages, and extremely heavy taxes. The French colonialists exploit workers by extending working hours, continuously reducing wages, and using child labor and women's cheap labor on a large scale. Workers are forced to work 12 to 14 hours a day in mines and rubber plantations. Workers are deprived of their basic political rights. Factories are surrounded by barbed wire. Secret agents monitor workers and manage them with barbaric methods. The working people in many cities are forced to wander the streets, and even a small number who build thatched huts to live in cannot find peace. The enemy and puppet authorities often force residents to relocate under the pretext of eviction, and sometimes even set fire to their only houses, creating a tragic situation of displacement.
    In the rural areas occupied by the French, the lives of farmers are extremely miserable. 75% of the arable land belongs to domestic landlords, French colonialists, and churches, while farmers, who account for 90% of the total population, only own 25% of the land, and many farmers have no land to cultivate. According to the 1948 report of the French colonialist official institution "Indochina Modernization Subcommittee," 57% of the majority of farmers in southern Vietnam have no land. Farmers are subjected to cruel exploitation and plunder, and exorbitant taxes and rents are as high as 70% to 80% of farmers' income. High interest rates ranging from 700% to 800% are rampant everywhere. Hungry and bankrupt farmers are fleeing the countryside in large numbers and wandering into cities.
    French colonialists and monopoly capitalists have plundered huge wealth from the people of the Indochinese occupied areas. According to French press materials, the profits of 45 French companies that relied on the "protection" of the French invading forces to rob Indochina in 1950 were 10.1 billion francs, while in 1946 they were only 542 million francs. The profits of Banque de l'Indochine increased by 24% from 1951 to 1952. It is because they made a fortune from the colonial war that they continued the war for a long time against the will of the French people.
    However, the bloody French colonial rule is facing increasing resistance from the people in the occupied areas. The people in the French-occupied areas of Indochina have launched anti-enemy and puppet struggles everywhere, fully supporting the national liberation war, and severely attacking the French and American aggressors and their running dogs. Even reactionary American newspapers and news agencies admit this fact. This proves even more clearly that the French colonial war and American intervention are sinful acts of aggression. Righteous humanity demands that the Geneva Conference should restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people.

    印度支那法国占领区人民的悲惨生活
    周修庆
    法国殖民者及其傀儡政权的血腥统治和殖民战争，使印度支那法国占领区人民长期地过着悲惨和贫困的生活。
    法国侵略者为了实行“用越南人打越南人”的诡计，把它控制下的所有城乡地区都变为炮灰供应地。保大傀儡政权于一九五三年六月宣布实行“义务”兵役制；今年四月十二日，所谓“战时内阁”更对所有二十岁到二十五岁的越南男子发布了“总动员令”。寮国伪政权也在一九五三年四月颁布了在全国各地抓丁的所谓“总动员令”，把十八岁到三十五岁之间的男子和后备队强征到伪军里去充当炮灰。高棉傀儡政权已经决定对年龄在二十一岁到三十五岁之间的一切高棉公民实行强迫军役。此外，法国殖民者为补充现役兵员的不足，更穷凶极恶地到处抓丁拉夫，逮捕妇女和十五岁以下的儿童，甚至把和尚也强拉去当伪军。仅据保大傀儡总理宝禄所承认的，在越南，被强征为伪军的人数，已由一九四九年的二万五千人增加到一九五三年的二十万六千人。最近，保大傀儡政权更准备加紧抓丁，今年要把伪军增加到五十五万人。
    法国侵略者为了进一步控制它的占领区，并企图阻止人民游击战争的扩展，从一九五三年春天开始，在占领区的边沿和交通要道上实行“并村”。在法侵略军较能控制的地区建立“大社”，然后把周围村庄里的老百姓都赶到“大社”里去，并建立法西斯“连环保”。法国侵略者还使用野蛮的手段毁坏人民的住宅和庄稼，把整个村庄夷为平地，然后强迫居民们集中在有铁丝网和了望塔包围的集中营中，以便强迫人民加入伪军，或任意地强占他们的财产。
    法侵略军到处实行杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”，拘捕整百的平民摔在海里；将整个村庄不分男女老少全部杀光；用锯将俘虏锯成肉块，把首级悬挂在市街上“示众”。如在越南中部，法侵略军曾强迫许多越南妇女，抱着自己的孩子，站在桥上，面对着河，然后下令要她们将自己心爱的孩子扔下河去；稍为迟疑的，立即被法军开枪打死。最野蛮无耻的是蹂躏妇女。在法军侵占区里，强奸暴行一日数起，从女孩子到七十岁的老妇人以至怀孕的妇女，都不能幸免。被法侵略军轮奸致死的妇女不可胜计，其中且有天主教徒和修道女。被越南人民军缴获的法侵略军统帅部的一个密令中规定：各级军官每月实行一次“集体强奸”，借以“提高士气”。
    法侵略军在印度支那进行的殖民战争中，大规模毁损庄稼，造成人为的饥馑。法侵略军所到之处，焚毁稻田和粮食，破坏农具，屠杀或拉走牲畜。在越南雨季来到时，法侵略军就破坏红河三角洲的河堤和水闸，造成水灾，以淹没农作物。此外还出动飞机滥炸各地的蓄水池与水闸，并扫射抢修的农民。被越南人民军俘掳的法国军官夏伯特曾供称：“法军司令部下令破坏一切东西，把这一区变成焦土。这个命令完全照办了。每一所房子每一所草屋都被烧了。所有牲畜和家禽都被宰杀了。果园被破坏了，每棵树都被砍倒了。稻田和磨坊也纵火烧毁了。好几天满天都是黑烟，除了法国兵外，什么都不剩了。”一个在法侵略军中服役而逃出来的奥地利人约甘·齐默尔曼在他的一篇谈话中也说：
  “我是印度支那法国占领军的兽行的见证人。许多特种支队焚毁了乡村，屠杀了全体居民。”
    在法占领区里，监狱比学校多，囚犯比学生多。仅在越南南部的昆仑岛上，除了有四个各可容
  一千人左右的大牢狱外，其他散落在山丛海角苦役围场的小牢房，不可胜数。在这个暗无天日的集中营中，不知有多少人被折磨死去。但是学校呢，法国殖民者拨给法占区的教育经费仅占总预算的百分之零点五。许多学校经常被借故封闭。在河内，小学毕业生因学费昂贵和缺少学校就读而失学的数以万计。城市中的许多学校常常是一百二、三十名的学生挤在一间狭窄的密不通风的教室里。法占区中的文盲占人口的百分之九十以上，其中寮国法占区的文盲更高达百分之九十七。
    法国殖民者及其走狗们正变本加厉地搜括印度支那人民，以进行殖民战争。保大傀儡总理宝禄今年三月初在所谓法兰西联邦会议的报告中曾无耻地吹嘘卖国贼对目前侵越战争预算支出的“贡献”。据他的报告，已有数十亿披阿士特（印度支那伪币）被投入了肮脏的殖民战争，今年又要给殖民战争付出三十五亿披阿士特。为此目的，保大傀儡政权实行的苛捐杂税，层出不穷。一九五三年以来，已将所谓“国防”负担税、水税、市场税等增加了一倍多，而人头税、畜牲税、土地税等也不断地增加。在许多城市中，除了名目繁多的几十种苛捐杂税以外，去年更巧立名目设立了许多新税：如扫路税、下水道税、走廊税、出生及死亡税……甚至还有根据住屋开的窗户的多少而强征的“窗户税”。虽然如此，保大傀儡政权财政赤字巨大，通货膨涨剧烈。在一九五三年五月，伪币贬值一次，即把法占区居民的钱掏去了一半左右。法国政府官方人士还厚颜无耻地说，印度支那伪币的贬值“可以大大地减轻法国的财政负担，使得法国能在印度支那加紧作战”。由于这次伪币的贬值，在一天之间，法占区的物价普遍地飞涨了百分之七十；而在河内，物价更涨了一倍多。据统计，自一九四七年到一九五三年，法占区物价上涨了十二倍，而工资则增加不到一倍。
    越南法占区工人在法国殖民者野蛮迫害与剥削下，痛苦日益加深。法国殖民者集中力量来扩充各军械修理厂及其他与其军队有直接关系的工厂，而和平工业、手工业则因美国货和法国货泛滥市场而被摧毁。大批工人被集体解雇，被部分解雇工人的数字往往达工人总数的百分之七十。工人失业的人数日益增加，平均五个工人即有一个失业。单在河内一地，二十万工资劳动者中失业的便占一半。有工作的工人们，因过度的劳动、低微的工资与极重的捐税压得喘不过气来。法国殖民者用延长工作日、不断减低工资和大规模地使用童工和妇女的廉价劳动的办法，来剥削工人。在矿井和橡胶园中每天强迫工人工作十二至十四小时。工人的基本政治权利都被剥夺。工厂四周围着铁丝网。特务监视工人，用野蛮的手段管理工人。许多城市的劳动人民，被迫流落街头，一少部分搭起茅舍来住的也得不到安宁。敌伪当局经常借口驱逼居民迁居，有时竟放火烧毁他们仅有的房子，造成流离失所的惨境。
    在法国占领的农村里，农民们的生活极为悲惨。可耕地的百分之七十五属于国内地主、法国殖民者和教堂，而占总人口百分之九十的农民却仅有百分之二十五的土地，许多农民无地可种。仅据法国殖民者官方机构“印度支那现代化小组委员会”
  一九四八年的报告，在越南南部，就有百分之五十七的大多数农民没有土地。农民受着残酷的剥削和掠夺，苛重的赋税和地租高达农民收入的百分之七十至八十。高达百分之七百到八百的高利贷到处流行。饥饿的、破产的农民大批地逃出乡村，流落城市。
    法国殖民者和垄断资本家却从印度支那占领区人民身上搜括了巨大的财富。根据法国报刊的材料，靠法国侵略军的“保护”来抢劫印度支那的四十五家法国公司一九五零年的利润是一百零一亿法郎，而一九四六年只有五亿四千二百万法郎。东方汇理银行一九五一年至一九五二年的利润增加了百分之二十四。正是由于他们靠殖民战争发了财，就长期违背法国人民的意志继续进行战争。
    但是，血腥的法国殖民统治正在受着占领区人民越来越大的反抗。印度支那法占区人民到处展开了反敌伪斗争，全力支持民族解放战争，给法、美侵略者及其走狗们以严重的打击。连美国反动报纸和通讯社也承认这个事实。这就更清楚地证明了，法国殖民战争和美国的干涉，是罪恶的侵略行为。正义人类都要求日内瓦会议应在尊重印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。
