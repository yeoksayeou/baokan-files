State-owned Agriculture Plays a Demonstrative Role in Spring Plowing
　　
　　Mechanical Farms in the Central-South Region Expand Spring Planting Area
　　The twenty-three state-owned mechanical farms in the Central-South Region are actively carrying out spring plowing. The state-owned mechanical farms in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have begun planting rice and have also planted cash crops such as peanuts and sugarcane. The state-owned mechanical farms in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces are busy selecting seeds, soaking seeds, and preparing rice paddies. The state-owned mechanical farms in Henan Province have harrowed the wheat fields and are preparing to plant cotton and soybeans. The total spring planting area of the state-owned mechanical farms in the Central-South Region this year is equivalent to 277% of last year's. Among the twenty-three farms, eight original farms are actively leveraging their production potential. The fifteen newly built farms and the expanded sections of the May 3rd Farm (formerly Shayang Farm), Datong Lake Farm, and Zhujiang Farm (formerly Wanqingsha Farm) have also begun production. Datong Lake Farm mobilized thirty tractors a day for spring plowing. Under the principle of "building the farm while producing," these newly built and expanded farms began preparing production materials in January and started reclaiming wasteland.
　　
　　More Than One Hundred Farms in Shandong Province Begin Spring Plowing
　　One hundred and fifty-four state-owned farms in Shandong Province have begun spring plowing and production. This year, these farms will produce more than 14 million catties of grain and more than 310,000 catties of ginned cotton for the state. Since the beginning of spring, rainfall has been scarce in Shandong Province. To ensure timely sowing of spring crops, all farms have been harrowing the land early to conserve moisture. More than twenty county farms, such as those in Wucheng, Linqing, and Jinxiang, had generally harrowed the winter-plowed land four to six times by early March. Farms in Jining, Laiwu, and other counties that produce more wheat, as well as the Guangbei Mechanical Farm, have paid attention to strengthening wheat field management. The wheat fields irrigated and harrowed and rolled at the Guangbei Farm have loose topsoil, and the wheat seedlings are growing lush and green. All farms attach great importance to reducing costs and increasing their demonstrative role in spring plowing, and have also formulated plans to help local agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams increase production.
　　
　　Ningxia Province State-owned Lingwu Farm Completes Spring Plowing
　　The state-owned Lingwu Farm in Lingwu County, Ningxia Province, has successfully completed its spring plowing task. Before the start of the spring plowing work, the leadership made specific arrangements for the spring plowing work; the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union also vigorously carried out mobilization and education work. The production enthusiasm of the workers has been high, and each production unit has proposed: to implement the accounting system, reduce costs, improve quality, and ensure safe production. The farm began harrowing on February 28. All three work stations launched a labor red flag competition and harrowed all 8,200-plus mu of farmland in five days. Spring sowing began on March 5, and all 5,260-plus mu of spring crops were sown by the 17th, and the production quality met the standards.
　　
　　Using New Technologies to Help Cooperatives and Mutual Aid Teams
　　Some state-owned farms and newly built agricultural machinery tractor stations in Sichuan Province are using new technologies to help agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams carry out spring plowing effectively. The Zitong County Farm and the Santai County Farm have successively signed technical cooperation contracts or technical assistance contracts with nearby agricultural production cooperatives. The technical cooperation contract signed between the Zitong County Farm and the Beitan Agricultural Production Cooperative stipulates that the farm is responsible for teaching members of the agricultural production cooperative to use walking plows; based on the agricultural production cooperative's experience in high-yield farming and the farm's actual cultivation methods, further apply good rice cultivation techniques such as growing strong seedlings, sparse seedlings and dense planting, and rational fertilization through mutual teaching and learning; the farm is responsible for supplying good seeds to the agricultural production cooperative. The state-owned Pixian Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Sichuan Province has signed spring plowing contracts with the first and second agricultural production cooperatives of Xipu Township and the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hexing Township.
　　
　　Nanyuan Tractor Station Increases Tilled Area
　　The Nanyuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Beijing is plowing for the nearby Red Star Collective Farm and agricultural production cooperatives. Teams have launched challenge competitions and come up with various methods to ensure plowing efficiency and quality. This year, the Nanyuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station has actively improved its management. Each team is assigned fixed responsibilities based on the plowing area, machinery, and personnel, implementing a system of fixed time, quantity, and quality. The total plowing area of the station (including land for farms, collective farms, and agricultural production cooperatives) has more than doubled compared to last year. The area ploughed for collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives has increased more than eight times compared to last year, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives ploughed for has increased from five last year to thirty this year. This year, the fuel consumption of various tractors has decreased, and the cost of plowing per mu has also decreased by 52% compared to last year. The Nanyuan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station is helping the Red Star Collective Farm and the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative train tractor drivers; currently, thirteen people are interning at the station.

    国营农业在春耕中发挥示范作用
    中南区机械农场扩大春播面积
    中南区二十三个国营机械农场正积极进行春耕。在广东、广西两省的各国营机械农场已开始播种水稻，并已种下花生、甘蔗等经济作物。在江西、湖南、湖北等省的各国营机械农场正忙着选种、浸种和整治秧田；在河南省的各国营机械农场已耙完麦地，准备播种棉花、大豆。中南区各国营机械农场今年春播总面积相当于去年的百分之二百七十七。二十三个农场中，八个原有的农场积极发挥生产潜力。新建的十五个农场和五三农场（原沙洋农场）、大通湖农场、珠江农场（原万顷沙农场）的扩建部分也都已开始投入生产。大通湖农场一天出动三十台拖拉机进行春耕。这些新建和扩建的农场，在“边建场、边生产”的方针下，一月份就开始准备生产资料，并动手开垦荒地。
    山东省一百多个农场开始春耕
    山东省一百五十四个国营农场开始春耕生产。这些农场今年将为国家生产一千四百多万斤粮食和三十一万多斤皮棉。入春以来，山东省雨量稀少，各农场为保证春季作物适时播种，都及早进行耙地保墒。武城、临清、金乡等二十多个县农场在三月初就已把冬耕地普遍耙了四遍到六遍。产麦较多的济宁、莱芜等县农场和广北机械农场，都注意加强麦田管理。广北农场经过灌溉和耙、压的麦田，表土松软，麦苗长得一片嫩绿。各农场在春耕中都很重视降低成本和提高示范作用，还制定了帮助当地农业生产合作社和互助组增产的计划。
    宁夏省国营灵武农场春耕完毕
    宁夏省灵武县国营灵武农场已胜利完成春耕任务。春耕工作没有开始以前，领导方面对春耕工作作了具体安排；党、青年团、工会也都大力开展了鼓动和教育工作。职工的生产情绪高涨，各个生产单位都提出：要贯彻核算制度，降低成本，提高质量，保证安全生产。二月二十八日农场开始耙地，全场三个作业站展开了劳动红旗竞赛，在五天内就把八千二百多亩耕地全部耙平了。三月五日开始春播，到十七日五千二百六十多亩春播作物已全部种完，生产质量都达到了标准。
    用新技术帮助合作社和互助组
    四川省部分国营农场和新建的农业机器拖拉机站，正以新的技术帮助农业生产合作社和互助组搞好春耕。梓潼县农场和三台县农场都先后和附近的农业生产合作社签订了技术结合合同或技术互助合同。梓潼县农场和北滩农业生产合作社订立的技术结合合同中，规定农场方面负责教会农业生产合作社社员使用步犁；根据农业生产合作社的丰产经验和农场实际栽培办法，通过互教互学，进一步运用好种壮秧、稀秧密植、合理施肥等水稻栽培技术；农场负责供应良种给农业生产合作社。国营四川省郫县农业机器拖拉机站，已和附近的犀浦乡第一、第二以及合兴乡红光等三个农业生产合作社签订春季代耕合同。
    南苑拖拉机站代耕面积增加
    北京市南苑农业机器拖拉机站正在代附近的红星集体农庄和农业生产合作社进行春耕。各小队间开展了挑战竞赛，想出各种办法保证耕作效率和质量。南苑农业机器拖拉机站今年积极改进了经营管理。各小队按耕作地区、机具、人员分别固定专责，实行定时、定量、定质制。全站代耕总面积
  （包括农场、集体农庄和农业生产合作社的土地）比去年增加一倍以上。给集体农庄和农业生产合作社代耕的面积比去年增加八倍多，给代耕的农业生产合作社也由去年的五个增加到今年的三十个。今年各种拖拉机的耗油量减低了，每亩代耕费也比去年降低百分之五十二。南苑农业机器拖拉机站正帮助红星集体农庄和张郭庄等农业生产合作社培养拖拉机手；目前在站里实习的有十三人。（附图片）
