Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: As the Geneva Conference is about to be held, the United States is once again conducting atomic weapons explosion tests. According to an announcement by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the United States will hold "a series" of atomic weapons tests, the first two hydrogen bomb explosion tests having been conducted on March 1st and 26th respectively in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.

The United States' holding of atomic weapons tests at this time is obviously a renewed attempt to flaunt its already bankrupt "atomic blackmail" and to create a false impression of strength for its precarious "policy of strength" in order to increase its bargaining power at the Geneva Conference. According to United Press International, simultaneously with the U.S. atomic weapons tests, "the Western countries possessing atomic energy—the United States, Britain, Canada, and France—have been holding emergency talks to prepare to bargain with Molotov at the Geneva Conference."

At the same time, in conducting atomic weapons tests, the United States violated the freedom and safety of navigation on the high seas. The March 1st test injured twenty-three people on board the Japanese fishing boat "Fifth Fukuryu Maru," which was sailing near the Marshall Islands. The United States, with utter inhumanity, used this incident to trumpet the "power" of atomic weapons and took the opportunity on the 19th to unilaterally announce the expansion of the "danger zone" prohibiting fishing in the high seas, hindering the freedom of navigation and fishing on the high seas. According to Kyodo News, the new "restricted zone" designated by the United States is "about six times the size of the previous restricted zone, covering a very large area and having a great impact on Japanese offshore fisheries."

The United States' intimidating atomic weapons tests have once again aroused angry protests from people around the world. Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council and former High Commissioner of the French Atomic Energy Commission, pointed out in an opinion published in "Libération" on March 27th that hydrogen bomb tests should be banned immediately. He said: Those who ordered these tests bear a grave responsibility. This kind of thing must not be allowed to continue unchecked. Joliot-Curie also said that what is needed first is the conclusion of a convention prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, which should also prevent tests like those conducted in the Marshall Islands.

Mrs. Pandit, President of the United Nations General Assembly, also issued an appeal in New Delhi on March 29th, calling for an immediate halt to the production of atomic weapons. She said: What is needed now is to create an atmosphere of peace in the world.

The Japanese public, who have profound memories of the U.S. atomic bombings, are extremely angry at the United States' renewed testing of atomic weapons and the injury to Japanese fishermen. They demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, compensation for the losses of Japanese victims, and opposition to the United States' illegal establishment of "restricted zones" on the high seas. Kasuga Masaji, Chairman of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, said in a statement on the 17th that the U.S. atomic weapons tests have endangered the peaceful people of Japan. He said: "We understand the great significance of the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the use of atomic weapons, and we must fight together with the people of the whole country to stop such tests." The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than three million members, issued an appeal on the 23rd to trade unions, peace organizations, and academic groups around the world, "demanding the prohibition of the manufacture of atomic weapons and international control of atomic weapons." Many Japanese peace organizations and other mass organizations have decided to launch a signature campaign demanding a ban on the testing and use of atomic weapons. Japan's various bourgeois political parties, including the ruling Liberal Party, also demand the military prohibition of the use of atomic energy.

Voices opposing U.S. atomic bomb tests are also coming from other countries in the Far East. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated on March 29th that he fully supports the demand to stop atomic weapons tests. Herbert Evatt, former chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and leader of the Australian Labor Party, said that efforts must be stepped up to reach an international agreement to strictly control atomic weapons tests by all countries. The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement pointing out that at a time when the Geneva Conference is about to be held, U.S. imperialism is using hydrogen bombs to threaten the people of the world, fully exposing its sinister plot to undermine world peace.

British public opinion has also universally called for a ban on atomic weapons. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, condemned the U.S. atomic weapons tests, saying: "This is indeed a challenge to all Christians and peace-loving people." He said: "Negotiations aimed at a universal ban on the use of atomic weapons should be resumed immediately." On March 30th, British Labour Party members of Parliament, during Churchill's reply to questions in the House of Commons regarding the U.S. atomic weapons tests, pointed out that the U.S. actions pose a threat to Britain. Former Labour Party Secretary of State for War John Strachey said: "Bombers carrying hydrogen bombs may be taking off from British airfields, so it is very likely to endanger the lives of British men, women, and children." Former Labour Party Minister of Labour Bevan pointed out that the U.S. atomic weapons tests are being conducted in the Pacific Ocean outside of U.S. territory. That evening, thirty-two Labour Party members of Parliament signed a motion calling for an end to further atomic weapons explosions and demanding that the five major powers make recommendations on atomic control and disarmament.

The Austrian Peace Council sent a telegram to the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace, expressing condolences to the victims of the U.S. atomic weapons tests and expressing the determination of the Austrian people to strengthen the struggle to stop weapons of mass destruction.

### 各国人士普遍谴责美国进行原子武器试验  一致要求禁止试验和使用大规模杀人武器

    各国人士普遍谴责美国进行原子武器试验
    一致要求禁止试验和使用大规模杀人武器
    【新华社三十一日讯】在日内瓦会议快要举行的时候，美国又在进行原子武器爆炸的试验。据美国原子能委员会宣布，美国将举行“一系列”的原子武器试验，其中头两次氢弹爆炸试验已先后于三月一日和二十六日在太平洋马绍尔群岛举行。
    美国在这个时候举行原子武器的试验，显然是重新耍弄它的早已破产的“原子讹诈”，为捉襟见肘的“实力政策”虚张声势，以便在日内瓦会议上增加讨价还价的资本。据合众社透露，与美国举行原子武器试验的同时，“西方拥有原子能的国家——美国、英国、加拿大和法国——已在举行紧急会谈，以准备在日内瓦会议上和莫洛托夫讲价钱”。
    同时，美国在进行原子武器试验的时候，违犯公海航行的自由和安全，在三月一日的试验中使航行在马绍尔群岛附近的日本渔船“福龙丸第五号”上的二十三名人员遭到伤害。美国竟毫无人性地利用这一事件大肆吹嘘原子武器的“威力”，并乘机在十九日片面宣布扩大在公海禁止渔业的“危险区域”，妨碍公海的航行和渔业自由。据共同社说，美国规定的新“禁区”，“等于以前禁区的六倍左右，范围非常广大，对于日本远洋渔业影响极大”。
    美国这次的恫吓性的原子武器试验，再度激起世界各国人士愤怒的抗议。世界和平理事会主席、前法国原子能委员会高级专员约里奥—居里三月二十七日在“解放报”发表意见指出，氢弹试验应该立即加以禁止。他说：那些下令进行这些试验的人负有严重的责任。决不能让这种事情肆无忌惮地继续干下去。约里奥—居里又说，首先需要的是缔结一个禁止使用原子武器的公约，该公约应同时制止像在马绍尔群岛进行的那种试验。
    联合国大会主席潘迪特夫人也于三月二十九日在新德里发出呼吁，要求立即停止制造原子武器。她说：目前所需要的是在世界造成和平气氛。
    对美国原子弹轰炸有着深刻记忆的日本公众，对美国再度试验原子武器并伤害了日本渔船人员，感到极大的愤怒。他们要求禁止原子武器、赔偿日本受害者的损失、反对美国非法在公海设立“禁区”。日本共产党中央指导部主席春日正一在十七日发表谈话指出：美国的原子武器试验已经危害了日本的和平人民。他说：“我们理解苏联提出禁止使用原子武器建议的重大意义，一定要和全国人民一道为制止这种试验而奋斗。”拥有三百多万名会员的日本工会总评议会在二十三日向世界各工会、和平组织和学术团体发出呼吁，“要求禁止制造原子武器，并由国际管制原子武器”。日本的许多和平组织和其他群众团体，已决定展开要求禁止试验和使用原子武器的签名运动。日本各资产阶级政党包括执政的自由党在内，也要求在军事上禁止使用原子能。
    反对美国原子弹试验的呼声也从远东其他国家传来。印度总理尼赫鲁三月二十九日表示，他完全赞成停止原子武器试验的要求。曾任联合国原子能委员会第一主席的澳大利亚工党领袖赫伯特·伊瓦特说，必须加紧努力达成一个国际协议，对一切国家试验原子武器加以严格管制。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会发表文告指出，当此日内瓦会议召开之前，美帝国主义竟以氢弹来威胁世界人民，其破坏世界和平的罪恶阴谋已充分暴露。
    英国的舆论也普遍提出禁止原子武器的要求。坎特伯雷教长约翰逊谴责美国的原子武器试验说：
  “这的确是对于所有的基督徒和热爱和平的人们的一种挑战。”他说：“目的在于普遍禁止使用原子武器的谈判应该马上重新开始。”三月三十日，英国工党议员在邱吉尔在下院就美国举行原子武器试验的问题答复质询时，纷纷指出美国的行为对英国的威胁。前工党陆军大臣约翰·斯特拉彻说：“携有氢弹的轰炸机也许是从英国飞机场起飞，因此它很可能危及英国的男女老幼的生命安全。”前工党劳工大臣比万指出，美国原子武器试验是在太平洋上美国领土以外的地方进行的。当晚，三十二名工党议员签署了一项动议，要求制止再进行原子武器爆炸；并要求五大国作出关于原子管制和裁减军备的建议。
    奥地利和平理事会打电报给日本拥护和平委员会，对美国原子武器试验的受害者表示慰问，并表示奥地利人民为加强制止大规模杀人武器而斗争的决心。
