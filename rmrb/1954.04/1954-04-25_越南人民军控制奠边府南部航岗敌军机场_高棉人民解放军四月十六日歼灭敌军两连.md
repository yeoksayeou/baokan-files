    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam People's Army has taken control of the French army's airfield at Hang Keo, a southern stronghold of Dien Bien Phu, and controls most of the Muong Thanh airfield.
    The Hang Keo stronghold in southern Dien Bien Phu is located at a bend in the Nam Youm River. The enemy established a resistance center there, approximately one kilometer long and wide, and used artillery fire to cover Muong Thanh. An airfield was built at this stronghold for transport planes to land.
    Since the beginning of the offensive against the northern defense line of Dien Bien Phu, the People's Army has simultaneously cut off the connection between the enemy forces in Muong Thanh and the enemy forces in Hang Keo in the south. Although the enemy in Hang Keo launched attacks every day, attempting to join up with the enemy in Muong Thanh, each of these attacks was repelled by the People's Army. On April 19th, two enemy companies, under the cover of three tanks, broke out of Hang Keo in three directions, but were forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties. Shortly thereafter, the Vietnam People's Army took control of the enemy's airfield in Hang Keo.
    On the night of April 22nd, the People's Army eliminated the last enemy stronghold west of the Muong Thanh airfield in Dien Bien Phu. Thus, the People's Army controls two-thirds of this airfield.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on April 23rd, the Cambodian Resistance Government issued a communique stating that on April 16th, the Khmer People's Liberation Army ambushed a French military transport convoy on the highway from Siem Reap to Stung Treng, four kilometers from Siem Reap. After half an hour of fighting, they destroyed 14 French vehicles and annihilated the 2nd Company of the 51st French Mobile Group, as well as 50 officers and non-commissioned officers. At the same time, the Khmer People's Liberation Army also annihilated a platoon of reinforcements coming from Siem Reap and destroyed two vehicles. French troops transferred from Stung Treng to reinforce were also ambushed by the Khmer People's Liberation Army, with one enemy platoon being annihilated and three vehicles destroyed.
    In the battles of that day, the Khmer People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of two French companies and destroyed 19 vehicles. This is another major victory for the Khmer People's Liberation Army since the liberation of Yunxai City on April 2nd. Currently, all enemy troops in the area from Stung Treng and the vicinity of Siem Reap to the Vietnamese border have been cleared, and the area from Yunxai, Bo Qiao, and Bo Kan to the vicinity of the Bolaven Plateau in Lower Laos has been liberated.

    越南人民军控制奠边府南部航岗敌军机场
    高棉人民解放军四月十六日歼灭敌军两连
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军已经控制了奠边府南部据点航岗的法军飞机场，并控制了芒清机场的大部。
    奠边府南部据点航岗位于约姆河转弯处，敌军在那里建立了一个长、宽各约一公里的抵抗中心，并以炮火掩护芒清；在这个据点上建立了一个飞机场，以便让运输机降落。
    人民军自开始进攻奠边府北部防线以后，同时即切断奠边府芒清敌军与南部据点航岗敌军的联系。虽然，航岗敌军每天都进行出击，企图与芒清敌军会合；但是敌军的每一次出击都被人民军击退。四月十九日，敌军两个连在三辆坦克掩护下，从航岗分三路向东北突围，但在受到重大伤亡后，被迫撤回。接着不久，越南人民军便控制了航岗敌军的飞机场。
    四月二十二日夜，人民军拔除奠边府敌军芒清机场以西的最后据点。至此，人民军控制了这个机场的三分之二。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社二十三日讯：高棉抗战政府发表公报说，四月十六日，高棉人民解放军在距暹边四公里处，由暹边到上丁的公路上截击一支法军运输队，经过半小时战斗，击毁了法军汽车十四辆，歼灭法军第五十一机动团第二连和五十名军官、军士。同时，高棉人民解放军还歼灭由暹边出来的援军一个排，并击毁汽车二辆。由上丁调来增援的法军也被高棉人民解放军截击，敌军一排被歼灭，汽车三辆被毁。
    在这一天的战斗中，高棉人民解放军共歼灭法军两个连，击毁汽车十九辆。这是高棉人民解放军从四月二日解放云晒城以来的又一次重大胜利。目前，从上丁和暹边附近直到越南边境这一地区所有的敌军都已被肃清，从云晒、波巧和波坎直到下寮的波罗芬高原附近这一块地区都已解放。
