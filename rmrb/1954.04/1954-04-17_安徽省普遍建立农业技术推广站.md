In order to promote agricultural science and technology and help farmers increase production, the Anhui Provincial People's Government is universally establishing agricultural technology extension stations. A total of seven agricultural technology extension institutes have been established in the locations of the various special commissioner's offices, sixty-eight agricultural technology extension stations have been established in the counties, and three branch stations are being piloted in Changhuaiwei District of Fengyang County, Chahua District of Fuyang County, and Chengguan District of Su County. Currently, the agricultural technology extension stations have been equipped with nearly 1,300 agricultural technicians. They will, in accordance with the spirit of "using local materials and promoting locally," summarize the advanced experiences of local farmers, investigate and study the local climate, farming conditions, and habits, promote agricultural science and technology, and cultivate farmer technology backbones to expand the influence of science and technology from point to area. The technology extension stations will, according to the production season, utilize farmers' forums, organize visits, hold short-term training classes, and organize technical guidance networks, etc., to absorb the successful experiences of local people and promote the cultivation, planting, seed selection, fertilizer application, and pest and disease control techniques for local major crops.

In 1953, the province focused on the pilot construction of agricultural technology extension stations in ten counties, including Guoyang and Fuyang, and achieved great success in summarizing local farmers' production experience, promoting scientific farming techniques, or promoting mutual aid and cooperation. After the universal establishment of stations throughout the province this year, it will play a greater role in unleashing the potential power of agricultural production.

    安徽省普遍建立农业技术推广站
    安徽省人民政府为了宣传与推广农业科学技术，帮助农民增产，正在普遍建立农业技术推广站。共计在各专署所在地建立农业技术推广所七处，各县建立农业技术推广站六十八处，并在凤阳县长淮卫区、阜阳县插花区、宿县城关区试办分站三处。现各农业技术推广站已配备了将近一千三百名农业技术人员，他们将根据“就地取材，就地推广”的精神，总结当地农民中的先进经验，调查研究当地的气候、耕作条件和习惯，宣传推广农业科学技术，并培养农民技术骨干，由点到面地扩大科学技术的影响。各技术推广站将根据生产季节，利用老农座谈会、组织参观、举办短期训练班、组织技术指导网等方式，吸取当地群众的成功经验，推广当地主要作物的耕作、栽培、选种、积肥施肥、防治病虫害等科学技术。
    一九五三年该省曾重点试建了涡阳、阜阳等十个县农业技术推广站，在总结当地农民生产经验、推广科学耕作技术或促进互助合作等方面，都取得了很大成绩。今年全省各地普遍建站后，对农业生产潜在力量的发挥，将会起更大的作用。
