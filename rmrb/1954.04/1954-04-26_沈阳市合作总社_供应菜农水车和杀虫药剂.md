    Shenyang City Cooperative Supplies Vegetable Farmers with Water Wheels and Insecticides
    The area sown with vegetables in the suburbs of Shenyang has expanded compared to last year, and the area of irrigated land has also increased. Since the beginning of spring, the city cooperative has delivered the means of production needed by vegetable farmers into their hands. The cooperative ordered enough cement to build one hundred and twenty wells, and purchased eighty Liberation-style water wheels from western Liaoning. At the same time, according to the requirements of vegetable farmers, it also processed forty water wheels in the cooperative's farm tool factory. Before distribution, the water wheels were inspected and tested. One water wheel can pump seven tons of water per hour, irrigating fifteen mu of vegetable gardens, increasing the pumping volume by three to four times compared to the old-fashioned iron bucket water wheels. Some vegetable farmers said: "Now we are not afraid of drought, we will definitely produce fresh and cheap vegetables this year to supply the workers."
    In addition, the cooperative also supplied vegetable farmers in Panjiantai and Baitapu districts with 1.4 million jin of potato seedlings, which can be planted on 10,000 mu of land. There are also pesticides such as "666" powder, rotenone, and Ceresan for pest control, and five hundred sprayers, which are being distributed to the countryside to supply vegetable farmers.

    沈阳市合作总社
    供应菜农水车和杀虫药剂
    沈阳市郊区蔬菜播种面积比去年有了扩大，水浇地也增多了。入春以来，市合作总社已将种菜农民需要的生产资料送到农民手里。该社订购了够打一百二十眼井的水泥，从辽西购进了八十台解放式水车，同时根据菜农要求又在合作社的农具厂加工了四十台水车。在发放前，经过了检查试验，一台水车每小时能抽七吨水，浇十五亩菜园子，比旧式铁斗水车的抽水量提高三、四倍。有的菜农说：这回可不怕天旱了，我们今年一定生产又新鲜又便宜的蔬菜来供应工人。
    另外，合作社还供给潘建台、白塔铺区的菜农一百四十万斤土豆栽子，可栽植一万亩地。还有防治虫害的“六六六”粉、鱼藤精、赛力散等农药，和五百台喷雾器，正陆续下乡供应菜农。
