The Qi Baishi Painting Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, held previews on the 26th and 27th and officially opened on the 28th.

Mr. Qi Baishi is a nationally renowned and internationally acclaimed Chinese painter, currently serving as the Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association and a professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Over the decades, he has created an estimated ten thousand or more Chinese paintings. This exhibition showcases 122 of his works from 1901 to the present, spanning 54 years, including flowers, birds, insects, fish, landscapes, and a few figure paintings.

At 2:30 PM on the 26th, the opening ceremony was held at the Jiangxue Xuan in the Forbidden City. Wu Zuoren, Vice Chairman and Director of the Exhibition Department of the Chinese Artists Association, delivered the opening speech. After introducing Qi Baishi's journey from a woodcarver to an outstanding painter, he said: "Mr. Baishi is full of a sense of justice, loves the motherland, and loves peace. He is diligent in his art, and in recent years, he has enthusiastically participated in the cause of defending peace with his creations, which makes us particularly value him."

Mr. Qi Baishi himself also attended the opening ceremony that day, and many guests shook hands with the old painter to congratulate him.

Leaders of various organizations and groups, international friends, and figures from the literary and artistic circles of the capital who visited the exhibition on the 26th and 27th unanimously praised Mr. Qi Baishi's paintings, believing that his long-term artistic labor has achieved invaluable accomplishments. He absorbed the strengths of traditional Chinese painting and developed and created upon them, forming his unique style. Particularly noteworthy among the exhibited works is the large painting "Hundreds of Flowers and Peace Doves," created in 1952 for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, demonstrating the painter's beautiful wishes for peace.

The exhibition is scheduled to be open until May 18th (closed for three days on April 30th, May 1st, and 2nd). (Xinhua News Agency)
