    CCP Shanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou Provincial Committees Convene Meetings
    Unanimously Endorsing the Fourth Plenary Session Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity
    [This newspaper, Taiyuan, 25th] The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee convened a meeting from April 12th to 17th, attended by over 700 Party member cadres at the county level and above, and at the regimental level and above in the military, to convey and discuss the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session.

    The meeting first heard a report by Comrade Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau, on the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session. This was followed by serious and earnest discussions in groups. Finally, Comrade Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, gave a summary report. All comrades present unanimously endorsed the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Political Bureau to the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Plenary Session. After careful discussions, all comrades present received a very profound political education, and everyone recognized the importance of raising revolutionary vigilance and the dangers of bourgeois individualism, especially complacency.

    Regarding how to convey the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, the meeting believed that it was necessary to further diligently convey and study the documents of the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session, to follow the spirit of the Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, to examine work and one's own ideological style, and to formulate specific measures to overcome shortcomings, correct mistakes, strengthen Party unity, and improve the Party's collective leadership system. The meeting believed that it was necessary to improve the Party's political education work and the theoretical and political study of cadres, so that the attention of leading cadres at all levels could be shifted from being entangled in daily affairs to major international and domestic political issues.

    During the meeting, the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee also made a decision on conscientiously studying and implementing the documents of the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session.
    [This newspaper] The CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee, at an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee from April 5th to 22nd, conveyed and discussed the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session. After hearing a report by Comrade Li Jingquan, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, on the Fourth Plenary Session, and after serious and earnest discussions, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the report of the Central Political Bureau to the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session and the Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity. At the meeting, many comrades, in connection with their own work and thinking, conducted self-criticism of all unhealthy tendencies that hinder Party unity. The meeting believed that to enhance unity, it is necessary to improve the system of collective leadership of the Party committee, hold Party representative conferences and congresses regularly, fully promote democracy, and strengthen Party supervision. The meeting decided to convene a provincial Party representative conference this year to further comprehensively examine the work of the Party and mobilize all Party members to strive for the realization of the Party's general line.
    [This newspaper] The CCP Guizhou Provincial Committee convened an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee from April 8th to 22nd to discuss the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. Two hundred and thirteen Party member cadres above the level of prefectural committee member attended the meeting. After hearing reports by Comrade Su Zhenhua, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, on the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee’s Fourth Plenary Session, and by Comrade Shen Yunpu, Deputy Secretary, on the report conveyed at the Twelfth Enlarged Meeting of the CCP Central Committee's Southwest Bureau, the meeting conducted serious discussions and unanimously passed a resolution endorsing the Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity. In view of the fairly widespread growth of extremely dangerous individualistic pride within the Party in Guizhou, the meeting believed that it is necessary to promote democracy, improve the Party committee system, actively conduct criticism and self-criticism within the Party's organizations at all levels, and struggle to enhance Party unity.

    中共山西、四川、贵州省委分别召开会议
    一致拥护四中全会关于增强党的团结的决议
    【本报太原二十五日电】中共山西省省委会在四月十二日到十七日召开了全省县级以上和军队团党委以上党员干部共七百多人会议，传达和讨论了七届四中全会的决议。
    会议首先听了中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛同志关于七届四中全会决议的传达报告。接着分组进行了严肃认真讨论。最后由中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳同志作了总结报告。全体到会同志一致拥护刘少奇同志代表中央政治局向七届四中全会所作的报告和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”。全体到会同志经过认真的讨论后受到了一次极为深刻的政治教育，大家都认识到提高革命警惕性的重要和认识到资产阶级个人主义，特别是骄傲自满情绪的危险性。
    关于怎样传达四中全会的决议，会议认为必须进一步认真传达与学习七届四中全会的文献，必须遵照关于增强党的团结的决议的精神，开展批评与自我批评，检查工作检查自己的思想作风，并制订出克服缺点、改正错误、增强党的团结与改善党的集体领导制度的具体办法。会议认为必须改进党的政治教育工作和干部的理论政治学习，以便使各级负责干部的注意力能从纠缠于日常事务的状态中转到国际和国内的重大政治问题上去。
    会议期间，中共山西省委又作出了关于认真学习和贯彻执行七届四中全会的文献的决定。
    【本报讯】中共四川省委在四月五日至二十二日的省委扩大会议上，传达和讨论了四中全会文件。会议听了省委书记李井泉同志关于四中全会的传达报告后，经过严肃认真的讨论，一致通过决议，拥护中共中央政治局向七届四中全会的报告和关于增强党的团结的决议。会上，许多同志联系自己的工作和思想，对一切有碍党的团结的不良倾向，进行了自我批评。会议认为增强团结，必须健全党委集体领导制，定期举行党的代表会议和代表大会，充分发扬民主，加强党的监督。会议决定在今年召开一次全省党代表会议，进一步全面检查党的工作和动员全体党员为实现党的总路线而奋斗。
    【本报讯】中共贵州省委四月八日至二十二日召开省委扩大会议，讨论了四中全会决议。出席会议的有地委委员以上党员干部二百一十三人。会议在听了省委书记苏振华同志关于七届四中全会决议和副书记申云浦同志关于中共中央西南局十二次扩大会议传达报告后，进行了认真的讨论，一致通过决议拥护增强党的团结的决议。鉴于贵州党内相当普遍地滋长着极端危险的个人主义骄傲情绪，会议认为必须发扬民主，健全党委制，在党的各级组织内积极进行批评与自我批评，为增强党的团结而斗争。
