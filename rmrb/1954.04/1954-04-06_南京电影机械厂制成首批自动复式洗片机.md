    Nanjing Film Machinery Factory Manufactures First Batch of Automatic Duplex Film Processing Machines
    On March 29th, China's first batch of four automatic duplex film processing machines was manufactured by the state-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory. Film processing machines are used to develop and print film copies. Until now, in China, apart from the 35mm projector copies used in city cinemas that are developed by old-style film processing machines, the 16mm copies used for rural projectors have been mostly developed and printed manually, resulting in low production and poor quality, far from meeting the continuously developing needs of the film industry. Therefore, the Central Film Bureau decided to first manufacture four film processing machines for developing black and white film, entrusting the glorious task of manufacturing the first batch to the state-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory.
    The film processing machine was designed with reference to blueprints from the Soviet Union and other countries. Except for the loading of film, which must be done manually, the rest of the production process is fully automated. The entire production only requires two people to press buttons and direct the entire machine. In addition, it is equipped with a special safety device to prevent the film from breaking or being damaged due to machine failure. It also has a hand-cranked rotating part, so that if there is a power outage during the developing process and it cannot be rotated electrically, it can still be rotated manually instead.
    The participation of these film processing machines in production can change the face of manual developing in the past. In the past, manually developing 16,000 meters of film copies, 16mm projector copies required 10 people to work for eight hours, and 35mm projector copies required 16 hours; while using the automatic duplex film processing machine, only four people working for eight hours can complete it. At the same time, developing with a film processing machine can also guarantee quality, eliminate problems such as broken films, scratched films, stains, and uneven tones caused by manual developing, making the picture uniform in density and clean; and it can also save the country tens of billions of yuan in foreign exchange and reduce costs by about 50%.
    Because this type of film processing machine is a new product, coupled with the heavy workload, the Nanjing Film Machinery Factory encountered many difficulties in the manufacturing process. However, thanks to the workers' display of the wisdom and perseverance of the working class, the difficulties were overcome one by one. For example, worker Xia Yongbin used his brains in the production process, overcame the difficulty of insufficient machine tool load capacity, accelerated the machine's running speed, and improved the tools, increasing production efficiency by one and a half times. Another example is when making bakelite parts, the milling cutter blades could not withstand the high heat of the bakelite during cutting when cutting materials on the milling machine, and four blades were broken in a row, affecting the timely completion of the task. After research by technician Cui Weiji, he used an electric saw tooth blade on the milling machine to replace the milling cutter, and the effect was very good, completing the plan on schedule. More difficulties occurred during the assembly process, and after technicians went to the workshop to study with the workers, the problems were all successfully resolved.

    南京电影机械厂制成首批自动复式洗片机
    我国首批四台自动复式洗片机，在三月二十九日由国营南京电影机械厂制造完成。洗片机是用来洗印电影拷贝的。直到目前，我国电影拷贝，除了城市电影院用的三十五毫米放映机用的拷贝由旧式洗片机洗片外，十六毫米的农村放映机用的拷贝绝大部分是用手工洗印，产量既低，质量又差，远赶不上电影事业不断发展的要求。因而中央电影局决定先行制造四台洗黑白片用的洗片机，将首批制造的光荣任务交给国营南京电影机械厂来完成。
    洗片机是参照苏联和其他国家的图样设计的。它的生产过程除了装片必须用人工外，其他部分全部是自动化。全部生产只要由两个人按动电钮指挥整台机器就行了。此外，还设有特制的安全装置，决不因机器发生事故而拉断或损坏了影片，还装有手摇转动部分，以备在洗印过程中万一停电而不能转动时，仍可用手摇转动来代替电动。
    这批洗片机参加生产，就可改变过去手工洗印的面貌。过去手工洗印一万六千公尺拷贝，十六毫米放映机用的需十人做八小时，三十五毫米放映机用的需十六小时；而用自动复式洗片机洗印，只要四个人做八小时就可完成。同时，用洗片机洗印，还可保证质量，消灭手工洗印所造成的断片子、抓损片子、发生污点，色调不均匀等毛病，使画面的浓淡均匀、清洁；并且又可为国家节省几十亿元外汇，降低成本百分之五十左右。
    由于这种洗片机是新产品，再加上任务繁，南京电影机械厂在制造过程中曾碰到不少困难。但由于职工们发挥了工人阶级的智慧和毅力，困难都一一被克服了。如工人夏永彬在生产过程中开动脑筋，克服了机床负荷能力不足的困难，加速了机器运转速度，改进了工具，使生产效率提高一倍半。又如在做胶木板零件时，在铣床下料，由于铣刀片耐不住胶木在切削中的高热，一连坏了四把，影响任务按期完成，经技术员崔维继研究，用电锯齿片拿到铣床上去，代替铣刀，效果很好，按期完成计划。在装配过程中发生的困难更多，经技术人员下车间与工人一道钻研，问题也都一一顺利解决了。
