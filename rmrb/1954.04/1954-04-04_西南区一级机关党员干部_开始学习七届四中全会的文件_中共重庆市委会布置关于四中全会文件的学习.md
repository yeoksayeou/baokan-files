[This article comes from our Chongqing dispatch on the 3rd] Party member cadres of first-level organs in the Southwest region are gradually beginning to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC has also issued instructions deploying the study of the documents from the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

Following the commencement of study by senior cadres in March, on April 2nd, the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a conference of middle-ranking party member cadres from party and government organs in the Southwest region. Comrade Song Renqiong delivered a report at the meeting on conveying the initiation of the study of the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Based on this report, the Party groups of various organs are leading the study and discussions. The study method emulates that of the enlarged meeting of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, requiring understanding of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution, the undertaking of criticism and self-criticism, and the examination of all kinds of unfavorable phenomena affecting party unity. Organs where unity problems exist should seek a basic resolution through study. Ordinary party member cadres, under the leadership of four directly subordinate party committees, are organized separately for the transmission and study. In addition to the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, the People's Daily editorials "Strengthening Party Unity is the Fundamental Guarantee for Realizing the General Line of the Transition Period" and "Studying the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, Correctly Conducting Criticism and Self-Criticism" will also be studied universally. The Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee requires all cadres participating in the study, in addition to grasping the essence of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution and understanding the importance of party unity from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, the principles of party building, the current situation inside and outside the party, and the realization of the general line of the transition period, to focus on resolving three issues: First, universally examine and criticize the dangerous nature of complacency, and establish a fine style of humility and perseverance; second, recognize that developing inner-party democracy and correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism are norms of party life; and third, fully recognize that strengthening collective leadership and perfecting democratic centralism of the party are the highest organizational principles of the party.

On March 30th, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC issued instructions to party organizations throughout the city regarding the study of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. The instructions pointed out that, in the course of study, the spirit of the documents must be carefully understood and applied to connect with reality and examine thinking. Study and examination should be realistic and based on facts, then raised to the level of thought for analysis and understanding, and self-criticism should be carried out. At the same time, one or two central issues should be resolved thoroughly and centrally based on the situation of each unit. Party committees at all levels should conduct a serious discussion on the problems raised in the study and formulate specific measures to enhance party unity.

    西南区一级机关党员干部
    开始学习七届四中全会的文件
    中共重庆市委会布置关于四中全会文件的学习
    【本报重庆三日电】西南区一级机关干部正逐步开展中国共产党七届四中全会文件的学习。中共重庆市委会也发出指示，布置关于七届四中全会文件的学习。
    继三月份高级干部开始学习后，四月二日，中共中央西南局召开西南区党政机关的中级党员干部大会，宋任穷同志在会上作了关于开始学习七届四中全会文件的传达报告。根据报告，各机关党组正领导学习和讨论。学习方法仿照中共中央西南局扩大会议的办法，要求领会四中全会决议的精神，开展批评与自我批评，检查不利于党的团结的各种不良现象，凡存在有团结问题的机关，应通过学习求得基本解决。一般党员干部以四个直属党委为领导，分别组织传达和学习。学习文件除四中全会的文件外，并普遍学习人民日报的社论：“增强党的团结是实现过渡时期总路线的根本保证”和“学习四中全会决议，正确地开展批评和自我批评”。中共中央西南局要求所有参加学习的干部，在学习中除了要领会四中全会决议的精神实质，从马克思列宁主义的基本原理、党的建设原则、当前党内外情况及实现过渡时期的总路线等方面认识党的团结的重要意义外，应着重解决三个问题：一、普遍检查与批判骄傲情绪的危险性，树立谦虚坚韧的优良作风；二、认识发扬党内民主，正确开展批评与自我批评，是党的日常生活的准则；三、充分认识加强集体领导和健全党的民主集中制，是党的最高组织原则。
    中共重庆市委会三月三十日向全市党组织发出关于学习七届四中全会文件的指示。指示指出：学习中，必须认真领会文件精神，运用文件精神来联系实际，检查思想；学习与检查应实事求是，从事实出发，然后提高到思想上来加以分析认识，开展自我批评。同时，应根据本单位情况，深入集中地解决一两个中心问题。对学习中提出的问题，各级党委都应进行一次认真讨论，订出增强党的团结的具体办法。
