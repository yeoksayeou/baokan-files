They are mostly cadres above the district level in Xinjiang and on-the-job cadres in industrial and mining enterprises; among them, there are 484 Party members of various ethnic groups and 120 members of the Communist Youth League. The main content of the students' study is the Party's general line and general task during the transition period; especially the Party's general task and various policies on ethnic minority issues during the transition period.
