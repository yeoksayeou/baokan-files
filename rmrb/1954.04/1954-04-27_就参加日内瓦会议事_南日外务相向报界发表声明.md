Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 25th, TASS dispatch: The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, issued the following statement to the press on April 25th regarding his participation in the Geneva Conference:

　　The Geneva Conference will open on April 26th; if the conference can peacefully resolve the Korean issue, it will be an important contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the relaxation of international tensions.

　　All the people of Korea and the peace-loving people of all nations around the world hope that the Geneva Conference will yield positive results.

　　The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will do its utmost to help achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is of great importance to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. We are deeply convinced that only through the sincere joint efforts of the representatives of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the People's Republic of China—and other participating countries, can a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue be achieved.

　　I would like to take this opportunity to extend my greetings to the citizens of Geneva and the citizens of Switzerland.
