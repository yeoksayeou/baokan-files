    Workers of Twenty Private Machine Factories in Jianghan District, Wuhan, Complete National Processing Tasks with Quality, Quantity, and on Schedule
    The workers of twenty private factories, large and small, including Xinsheng, Minsheng, and Jianmin, in the machine industry of Jianghan District, Wuhan, completed the national first-quarter processing orders with quality, quantity, on schedule, or ahead of schedule.
    When these private factories began accepting national processing orders at the beginning of last year, due to blind production and poor management, individual factories experienced rework and delays of some or all products every month, which seriously affected the national construction plan. This year, the tasks undertaken by various factories in the first quarter were larger than last year, and the time was even tighter. For example, the Xinsheng Machine Factory was very busy last year making six cement mixers and twenty-five winches. This year, the first-quarter task came down later, and excluding the New Year holidays, it had to complete eight cement mixers and thirty-five winches in thirty-five days. However, under the education of the Party organization in the district's machine industry, the workers of each factory launched a heated competition of challenges and responses within and outside the factories, and the workers' creations continued to emerge. According to preliminary statistics, in ten factories, twenty-five effective rationalization proposals have been tested and applied, greatly improving labor productivity and playing a decisive role in completing the first-quarter processing orders with quality, quantity, and on schedule. In the process of completing the task, accounting and management personnel also played a significant role in improving management, overcoming blindness, and correctly calculating man-hours to reduce costs. For example, in processing 120 tons of four-inch water pipes for the Municipal Hardware and Machinery Company, the Wang Xingtai Sand Casting Factory saved the country 255.525 million yuan by reducing man-hours and reducing the weight of the water pipes.

    武汉市江汉区二十家私营机器工厂职工
    按质按量按期完成了国家加工任务
    武汉市江汉区机器业私营新生、民建等二十家大小工厂，按质、按量、按期或提前完成了国家第一季度加工订货任务。
    这几家私营工厂在去年初开始接受国家加工订货时，由于盲目生产、管理不善，每月都有个别工厂因部分或全部产品返工误期，严重影响了国家建设计划。今年第一季度各厂承接任务比去年更大，时间也更紧。如新生机器厂去年做六部水泥搅拌机，二十五部绞车，还很忙，今年第一季度任务下来较迟，除去新旧年假，必须在三十五天中完成八部水泥搅拌机和三十五部绞车。但是各厂工人在该区机器业党组织的教育下，展开了厂内、厂外挑战应战的热潮，工人们的创造不断地出现。根据初步统计，在十个工厂中，试用有效的合理化建议已达二十五件，大大提高了劳动生产率，对按质、按量、按期完成第一季度加工订货任务，起了决定性的作用。在完成任务的过程中，会计和管理人员在改善管理克服盲目性、正确核算工缴降低成本等方面，也起到很大的作用。如王兴太翻砂厂在为市五金机械公司加工一百二十吨四寸水管中，由于降低了工缴，减轻了水管重量，就为国家节约了二亿五千五百二十五万元。
