The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its Seventh Party Representative Meeting in early March. After hearing the report by Wu Zhipu, Second Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC, on the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, carried out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, reviewed and summarized the work of Henan Province in 1953, and determined the work guidelines and tasks for 1954.

The meeting held that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Henan Provincial Party organization concentrated its efforts in 1953 to organize the transformation from social reform to economic construction on a province-wide scale, and successfully completed the tasks assigned by the state for the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, enabling the socialist and semi-socialist economic components in the province to achieve significant growth. In 1953, the total value of industrial and agricultural production in the province increased by 3.81% compared to 1952; the proportion of industrial output value increased from 11.35% in 1952 to 12.43%. In terms of agricultural production, the total grain output in 1953 increased by 9.3% compared to 1952. At the same time, through extensive and in-depth propaganda and education on the general line, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people has been unprecedentedly enhanced. More than 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives have been developed throughout the province.

The meeting seriously examined the bourgeois individualism of some cadres, as well as subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucratic work styles; it focused on criticizing the tendency of some leading cadres to fear democracy and not dare to carry out criticism and self-criticism due to the growth of a certain degree of pride and complacency. The meeting held that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's ideological construction, strengthen the Party's collective leadership, and fully promote inner-Party democracy under correct political and organizational principles, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and wage a resolute struggle against any erroneous ideas and behaviors that are not conducive to Party unity.

Based on the province's situation, the meeting determined the work tasks for Henan Province in 1954. In terms of industry, it will continue to implement the principle of "basic construction first," conscientiously do a good job in construction, and strive for a balance in construction throughout the year. In terms of agriculture, it will launch a production increase movement centered on the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On the basis of 1953, it will complete the task of increasing grain production by 24 billion jin, cotton by 306 million jin, and other industrial raw materials; and develop 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest, while consolidating and improving them.
