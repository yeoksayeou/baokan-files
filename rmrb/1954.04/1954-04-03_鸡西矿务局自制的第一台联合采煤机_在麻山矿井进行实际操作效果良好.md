The first "Donbas Type I Combined Coal Mining Machine" successfully trial-produced by the Jixi Mining Bureau General Machinery Factory staff on December 20th last year, after a period of preparation, was put into actual operation at the Mashan No. 3 Mine in Jixi on March 3rd of this year. After technical appraisal, the machine's efficiency reached advanced technical standards.

Seeing the actual operation of the combined coal mining machine, the coal miners greatly increased their confidence in realizing the country's socialist industrialization. Zhang Hongliang, the combined coal mining machine driver, said, "In the future, we must study Soviet advanced technology even harder, skillfully master the machine, produce more coal for the motherland, and let the motherland's socialist industrialization arrive sooner!"

    鸡西矿务局自制的第一台联合采煤机
    在麻山矿井进行实际操作效果良好
    去年十二月二十日，鸡西矿务局总机厂职工试制第一台“顿巴斯一型联合采煤机”成功后，经过一个时期的准备工作，鸡西矿山于今年三月三日在麻山三井进行实际操作，经过技术鉴定，机器效能达到了先进技术标准。
    看到联合采煤机实际操作，煤矿工人大大提高了实现国家社会主义工业化的信心。联合采煤机司机张洪亮说：“今后我们更得好好学习苏联先进技术，熟练地掌握机器，多给祖国生产煤炭，让祖国社会主义工业化早日到来！”
