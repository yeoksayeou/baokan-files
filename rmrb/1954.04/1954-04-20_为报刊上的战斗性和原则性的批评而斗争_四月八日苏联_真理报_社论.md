Among the weapons in the Party's arsenal for carrying out criticism and self-criticism, newspapers occupy an important position. Our newspapers synthesize the vast experience of the masses, support all new and advanced things that accelerate the advance of Soviet society along the road of communist construction; our newspapers frequently criticize the shortcomings in the work of Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, enabling self-criticism and criticism from below to be widely展开.

Recently, materials elaborating on Party organs' improvement of work in the spirit of the requirements of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in September and the Plenary Session in February-March have appeared more frequently in newspapers. The newspapers have also criticized the bureaucratic and formalistic leadership methods in leading agriculture.

However, facts prove that not all newspapers have launched a sharp and principled struggle against the shortcomings and errors in economic and cultural construction.

A few days ago, Pravda published serious shortcomings and errors regarding the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper. In the editorial department of this newspaper, a style of treating readers' criticisms with contempt and bureaucracy, which runs counter to the traditional habits of our newspapers, had been established. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, T. Kartashov, fearing to damage his relationship with the leading personnel of the Republic's organizations, made the newspaper avoid criticizing these leading personnel.

After discussing the work of the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper, the Central Committee of the CPSU instructed the Chuvash Party Provincial Committee to pay attention to its unsatisfactory leadership of the newspaper, and proposed to the Provincial Committee to take measures to ensure the improvement of the work of the newspaper's editorial department, and to carry out realistic and principled criticism in the newspaper to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of the Republic's Party, Soviet and economic organizations in leading industry and agriculture.

The primary duty of our newspapers is to synthesize the extremely rich experience of communist construction, to demonstrate the constantly growing creative initiative of the masses with concrete examples and facts, to fight for the promotion of new and advanced things, and at the same time to fire at those bureaucratic, conservative mindsets and stagnant phenomena. Bureaucrats, formalists, and those who only hope to squat in the office, isolate official documents from life, and deviate from the vivid organizational work among the masses must be exposed to the light of day.

The great Lenin demanded that newspapers should launch a realistic, ruthless, and truly revolutionary struggle against the specific representatives of all evils. Unfortunately, we still often encounter some editorial departments and editors who prefer to use weak and smooth words instead of sharp criticism of the shortcomings in the work. It cannot be said that the "Worker's Edge Region" newspaper in Ivanovo Oblast has not written articles on the poor quality of industrial products, nor can it be said that the "Worker's Edge Region" newspaper has not criticized those who manufacture defective products. Articles have been written, criticisms have also been made, but the manuscripts on such issues are often written without enthusiasm and lack profound knowledge.

There are also facts showing that the Party, Soviet organizations, and agricultural organs of the Krasnodar Territory are very slow in carrying out the work of sowing intercrops using the square cluster method, and have not taken necessary measures to increase the yield of maize. At the same time, the "Soviet Kuban" newspaper has not raised this issue in the newspaper.

Of course, sharply raising the issue of a certain shortcoming in the work has nothing in common with loud noises and unnecessary shouting. The Party has warned our newspapers not to be confused by criticism for the sake of criticism, and not to turn criticism into a sensational game. Criticism should help improve leadership, consolidate discipline, and increase the initiative and sense of responsibility of staff.

At present, in our country, a broad, nationwide movement is underway to vigorously increase labor productivity, and to achieve high labor productivity in all industrial enterprises, basic construction units, transportation departments, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and on all fronts of our great communist construction. Our newspapers should deeply publicize the excellent examples of the organization of social labor, resolutely combat conservatism, old-fashioned ideas, mismanagement and waste, and resolutely fight against the shortcomings in the organization of production and the application of technology.

Many of our newspapers, especially those in the large industrial centers of the country, are weak in criticizing backward enterprises, and do not expose the reasons why many enterprises that have not completed national tasks have failed to complete their tasks. This phenomenon cannot be considered normal.

An important task of the newspapers is to expound on ideological work issues. It is the responsibility of the newspapers to use the weapon of criticism to help Party organizations at all levels improve their combat effectiveness in all aspects of the ideological front – Party propaganda, political mobilization, radio, science, literature, drama, film, music, fine arts; and to apply all tools and weapons of ideological education to the cause of communist education of the Soviet people.

Life and experience show that only those newspapers that attract the broad masses of working people to participate in exposing and eliminating the facts of unaccountable phenomena and backwardness in work, and to participate in exposing and eliminating the unhealthy trends of bureaucracy and the accumulated habits of formalism, can achieve great success in the struggle against shortcomings.

It is the responsibility of the Party committees to regularly guide the work of the newspapers, actively support the critical remarks in the newspapers, help the editorial departments of the newspapers to achieve practical results from the published critical articles, and resolutely fight against even the smallest attempts to evade the criticism in the newspapers.

Extensively carrying out principled criticism in newspapers can further enhance the role of newspapers as a powerful ideological weapon of our Party in communist construction. (Translated by Zheng Qimin)

### 为报刊上的战斗性和原则性的批评而斗争——四月八日苏联“真理报”社论

    为报刊上的战斗性和原则性的批评而斗争
    ——四月八日苏联“真理报”社论
    在党为了开展批评与自我批评所拥有的武器库中，报刊占有重要的地位。我们的报刊综合群众的巨大经验，支持一切加速苏维埃社会沿着共产主义建设道路前进的新的先进的事物；我们的报刊对党、苏维埃和经济组织的工作中的缺点经常给予批评，使自我批评和自下而上的批评得以广泛展开。
    近来，在报纸上更加经常地出现了阐述党机关根据苏共中央九月全会和二月—三月全会的要求的精神来改进工作的材料。报纸对于领导农业的文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法也给予了批评。
    但是，事实证明，还不是所有的报刊，都对于经济建设和文化建设工作中的缺点和错误，展开了尖锐的和原则性的斗争。
    前几天，真理报公布了关于“苏维埃楚瓦什”报的严重缺点和错误。在这个报纸的编辑部里，曾建立了与我们报刊的传统习惯背道而驰的，以轻视态度和官僚主义态度来对待读者批评的作风。该报总编辑特·卡尔塔晓夫唯恐破坏了他与共和国各组织的领导人员的关系，因而使报纸回避了对这些领导人员的批评。
    苏共中央在讨论了“苏维埃楚瓦什”报的工作问题之后，曾指示楚瓦什党的州委会注意其对该报的不能令人满意的领导，并向州委会提议，要他们采取措施，保证改进该报编辑部的工作，在报纸上开展实事求是的原则性的批评，以消灭共和国的党、苏维埃和经济组织在领导工业和农业的工作中的缺点。
    我们报刊首要的义务，就是综合共产主义建设的极其丰富的经验，用具体的例子和事实来表现出群众的不断增长着的创造积极性，为推广新的先进的事物而斗争，同时要向那些官僚主义、守旧心理和停滞不前的现象开火。必须把官僚主义者、文牍主义者以及那些只希望蹲在办公室内使公文与生活隔绝，脱离了在群众中的生动组织工作的那些人，都置于光天化日之下。
    伟大的列宁曾要求报纸要同一切恶事的具体代表者，展开实事求是的、无情的和真正革命的斗争。可惜，至今还经常遇到这样的一些编辑部和编辑人员，他们宁愿使用一些软弱无力的圆滑的词句，来代替对工作中的缺点进行锋利的批评。不能说，依万诺夫州“工人边区”报没有撰写过关于工业产品质量低劣的文章，不能说“工人边区”报没有批评过废品制造者。文章是写了，批评是也批评了，但是，关于这类问题的稿件，却常常是写得缺乏热情，缺乏深刻的知识。
    也有这样的事实，克拉斯诺达尔边疆区的党、苏维埃组织和农业机关，对于运用方形簇种法来播种中耕作物的工作，进行得十分缓慢，没有采取必要措施来提高玉蜀黍的收获量，同时“苏维埃库班”报对此问题，也未在报上提出来。
    当然，尖锐提出有关工作中某一缺点的问题，是与大吵大嚷和不必要的叫喊毫无共同之点的。党曾警告我们的报刊，不要迷惑于为批评而批评，不要把批评变成耸人听闻的游戏。批评应当是帮助改进领导，巩固纪律，提高工作人员的积极性和责任感。
    目前，在我们国家里，正开展着广泛的全人民的大力提高劳动生产率的运动，和在各个工业企业，基本建设单位、运输部门、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站以及我们伟大的共产主义建设的一切战线上都能够获得高度的劳动生产率的运动。我们的报刊应当深入地来宣传社会劳动组织的优秀范例，应当坚决的同保守主义、守旧思想、不善于经营和浪费现象作斗争，应当坚决地与在组织生产和运用技术上的缺点作斗争。
    我们的许多报纸，特别是国家的大工业中心的报纸，对于落后企业的批评软弱无力，对于许多未完成国家任务的企业，不去揭露他们未完成任务的原因，这种现象不能认为是正常的。
    报刊的重要任务，是阐述思想工作问题。报刊的责任就是运用批评武器，帮助党的各级组织提高其在思想战线上的一切方面的战斗力——党的宣传、政治鼓动、广播、科学、文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术；把一切思想教育的工具和武器运用到对苏维埃人进行共产主义教育的事业上。
    生活和经验证明，只有那些吸引广大劳动群众参加揭发和消灭工作中的无人负责现象和落后现象的事实，参加揭发和消灭官僚主义的歪风和文牍主义的积习的报纸，才能在和缺点进行斗争中获得巨大的成就。
    党委会的责任就是要经常指导报纸的工作，积极地支持报纸上的批评言论，帮助报纸编辑部使已刊登的批评文章获得实际的效果，同那怕是极小的企图逃避报刊上的批评的现象进行坚决的斗争。
    在报纸上广泛地开展原则性的批评，能更加提高报刊作为我们党在共产主义建设上强大思想武器的作用。　（郑启民译）
