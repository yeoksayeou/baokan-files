The basic-level election work in Liaodong Province, which began in May of last year, was fully completed by mid-March of this year.

During the basic-level election campaign, the people learned to exercise their democratic rights and actively participated in the elections. Over 95% of voters throughout the province participated in the voting, with some villages reaching 100%. On this basis, people's congresses were convened, and new people's governments were elected, further perfecting the people's democratic dictatorship system, consolidating and purifying basic-level power, and reviewing the work of the government and the work style of cadres. In the basic-level election campaign, cadres who were good in nature, worked actively, and maintained close ties with the masses were praised by the masses and re-elected. Those cadres who were good in nature, worked actively, but had some tendencies toward coercion and commandism, made sincere self-criticisms and were re-elected after gaining the understanding of the masses. They deeply felt the honor of serving the people and resolved to work actively, promote a democratic work style, and significantly reduce the phenomenon of coercion and commandism. Those who seriously violated laws and discipline, degenerated, and were class dissidents were eliminated in the election. According to statistics from 1,393 villages in 18 counties (cities), cadres elected as representatives accounted for about 69%, which enabled basic-level power to retain its original backbone and add new blood. During the election campaign, landlords, former rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries tried every means to steal election rights and carry out sabotage activities, but under the strong leadership of Party and government at all levels, democracy was fully promoted, the people earnestly discussed the list of representative candidates, and the enemy's conspiracies were crushed.

Throughout the entire process, all parts of the province implemented the policy of "taking production as the main focus, combining production with universal suffrage work," so that election work and production were organically combined, influencing and promoting each other. While carrying out election work, various localities organized the masses to engage in production according to different production seasons. For example, during the slack farming season, a manure accumulation campaign was launched. During the rainy season, the masses were organized to dig ditches, repair dams, prevent floods and waterlogging, rescue crops, and replant early-maturing crops. In winter, sideline production and the sale of surplus grain were organized. In villages where basic-level elections were conducted in winter, the work teams conducted in-depth propaganda and education on the general line among the masses. The broad masses understood the bright prospects of socialism and the superiority of mutual assistance and cooperation, and a surge of organization was initiated.

In the basic-level elections, Liaodong Province paid attention to strengthening leadership over backward villages. Stronger cadres were sent to these villages to help with the work and earnestly implement the policies. The masses raised their awareness and elected the people they considered satisfactory and necessary as people's representatives and government committee members. Through the elections, village political power organizations with impure elements were reorganized, and degenerated and seriously law-breaking bad elements were eliminated from the village political power. Cadres with generally backward thinking and problems in their work style were given education and were allowed to make deep self-criticisms to the masses. In villages with petty sectarianism, unity education was conducted among the masses. This improved the effectiveness of government work, improved the relationship between cadres and the masses, and strengthened the people's sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. The work in backward villages began to change.

After the conclusion of the basic-level election work, Liaodong Province began to pay attention to the following tasks: (1) Further strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, so as to further exert the active role of basic-level power in production and construction and socialist transformation. Counties and cities should strengthen leadership over basic-level political power, educate cadres to learn democratic leadership methods, clarify responsibilities, overcome the phenomenon of multiple basic-level organizations and cadres holding multiple positions, help hold village people's congresses well, promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and focus on providing in-depth leadership to backward villages in conjunction with regular work. (2) Do a good job in the comprehensive statistical work of population surveys, and properly handle some of the minor issues left over from the elections. (3) Actively prepare for the convening of county and city people's congresses. (4) People's congresses and people's government committees at all levels should be convened according to the system to consolidate them and give full play to their power.

    辽东省基层选举工作全部结束
    辽东省的基层选举工作从去年五月开始，到今年三月中旬已全部完成。
    在基层选举运动中，人民学会了使用民主权利，积极地参加了选举。全省百分之九十五以上的选民都参加了投票，最高的村达百分之百。在此基础上又召开了人民代表大会，选出新的人民政府，使人民民主专政制度更加完备，基层政权更加巩固和纯洁，并检查了政府工作和干部工作作风。在基层选举运动中，那些本质好，工作积极，能密切联系群众的干部受到群众的表扬，继续当选；那些本质好，工作积极，但有些强迫命令作风的干部，做了诚恳的检讨，得到群众的谅解之后也继续当选。他们深深感到为人民服务的光荣，决心积极工作，发扬民主作风，强迫命令现象显著减少。那些严重违法乱纪、蜕化变质的分子和阶级异己分子，则在选举中被剔除出去。据十八个县（市）一千三百九十三个村的统计，干部被选为代表的占百分之六十九左右，这就使基层政权保持了原有骨干，又增加了新的血液。在选举运动中，地主、旧富农以及反革命分子曾千方百计地企图窃取选举权利，进行破坏活动，但在各级党政的坚强领导下，充分地发扬了民主，人民认真地讨论了代表候选人名单，粉碎了敌人的阴谋活动。
    全省各地自始至终都贯彻了“以生产为主，结合生产进行普选工作”的方针，使选举工作与生产有机结合，相互影响，相互推进。各地在选举工作的同时，根据不同的生产季节组织群众进行生产。如在挂锄期间，开展了积肥运动；在雨季组织群众挖壕，修坝，防汛，防涝，抢救庄稼，补种早熟作物等；在冬季组织了副业生产和出售余粮工作。在冬季进行基层选举的各村，工作组曾深入地向群众进行了总路线的宣传教育，广大群众认识了社会主义的光辉远景和互助合作的优越性，掀起了组织起来的热潮。
    在基层选举中，辽东省注意加强了对落后村的领导，各地都派了较强的干部到这些村帮助工作，认真贯彻了政策。群众提高了觉悟，选出自己认为满意和必要的人为人民代表和政府委员。经过选举，改组了成份不纯的村政权组织，剔除了村政权中蜕化变质和严重违法乱纪等坏分子。对一般思想落后，工作作风有毛病的干部给以教育，并让他们向群众作深刻检讨。对闹小宗派的村，向群众进行了团结教育。这样就提高了政府工作效能，改善了干部和群众的关系，加强了人民群众主人翁的责任感，落后村的工作面貌开始改变了。
    在基层选举工作结束后，辽东省开始注意做好以下工作：（一）进一步加强工人阶级思想领导和巩固工农联盟，以便更加发挥基层政权在生产建设和社会主义改造中的积极作用。各县市要加强对基层政权的领导，教育干部学会民主领导方法，明确职责，克服基层组织多、干部兼职多的现象，帮助开好村人民代表大会，促进互助合作运动，结合经常工作重点深入领导落后村。（二）做好人口调查综合统计工作，并对选举中遗留下的一些细小问题进行适当的处理。（三）积极做好召开县、市人民代表大会的准备工作。（四）各级人民代表大会和人民政府委员会要按制度召开，使之巩固，并充分发挥其权力作用。
