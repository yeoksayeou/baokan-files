    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Introduction to the Twelfth Issue of the Chinese Edition

    The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, No. 12, 1954, has been published.

    This issue publishes the results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Comrade Malenkov's speech at the voters' meeting in the Leningrad constituency of Moscow. This issue also publishes an editorial entitled "The Victory of Soviet Socialist Democracy." The editorial points out: The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are a major event in the life of the great Soviet people. This election powerfully demonstrates the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, and the rock-solid unity of the Soviet people around the Communist Party and the Soviet government. Soviet socialist democracy enables the people to fully develop constructive initiative, rich talents, and endless revolutionary energy without any restrictions. The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and all the working people of the Soviet Union have consistent goals and tasks. The Soviet people wholeheartedly support the only correct domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government that have been tested in decades of struggle. The brilliant results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union prove the Soviet people's boundless trust and love for the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The editorial then discusses the deprivation of the people's right to vote in capitalist countries and the selfless struggle of the Communist and Workers' Parties in these countries for the people's democratic rights and freedoms. The editorial concludes: The brilliant, free, and creative life of the Soviet people, their unbreakable unity, and their vigorous patriotism fully demonstrate the invincible power of socialism and democracy.

    Important articles published in this issue include: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev's speech at the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, a summary of the report of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party given by the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, Bierut, at the Second Congress of the Party, and German United Socialist Party Central Committee Chairman and Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl's "The German and Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference," and French Communist Party Secretary Duclos's "The Struggle Against the 'European Defence Community' is the Central Task of the French Communist Party."

    Grotewohl's article points out: Although the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference was unable to reach an agreement on such an important international issue as the German question, the results of this conference should still be considered as entirely positive. This conference marks a major step forward on the road to easing international tensions. The course of the Berlin Conference powerfully tells the German people that only the Soviet Union has put forward a clear plan to solve the German question, while the Western countries have not put forward any plan. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposals on the German question are the only constructive plan for restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, and are a sharp weapon for the German people in their struggle for the fundamental rights of the nation. Grotewohl said: The results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference have opened a new stage in the struggle of the German people. The German people must resolutely and confidently take on their own cause and strive to realize the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference.

    Duclos's article is a summary of his report at the plenary session of the French Communist Party Central Committee on March 5. Duclos emphasized: The struggle to establish peace in Indochina is closely linked to our struggle against the "European Defence Community" treaty, which we must intensify. French Communists must resolutely make the working class take unified action, and unite all honest French people who oppose the revival of German militarism to carry out a massive protest movement. It is the responsibility of every party member to unite with all patriots and actively participate in the signature collection work against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties. Duclos said: Opposition to the "European Defence Community" must become the central issue of our attention. The current struggle requires each of us to fully understand the significance of the battle we are currently waging, which must be won. We must take the necessary measures with the utmost responsibility, give full play to our initiative, and do our utmost to fight to prevent the ratification of the "European Defence Community" treaty.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十二期已经出版。
    本期发表了苏联最高苏维埃的选举结果，和马林科夫同志在莫斯科列宁格勒选区的选民大会上的演说。本期并以“苏维埃社会主义民主的胜利”为题发表社论。社论指出：苏联最高苏维埃的选举是伟大的苏联人民生活中的一件大事。这次选举有力地表现了苏联人民精神上和政治上的牢不可破的团结，表现了苏联人民坚如磐石般地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围。苏维埃社会主义民主，使人民能够不受任何限制地充分发挥建设性的首创精神、丰富的才能、无穷无尽的革命精力。共产党、苏联政府和苏联全体劳动人民有共同一致的目标和任务。苏联人民衷心拥护共产党和苏联政府在几十年的斗争中经过考验的唯一正确的国内政策和外交政策。苏联最高苏维埃选举的辉煌结果，证明了苏联人民无限信任和热爱共产党和苏联政府。社论接着论述了资本主义国家人民选举权利受到剥夺和这些国家的共产党和工人党为人民的民主权利和自由而忘我斗争的情形。社论最后说：苏联人民的辉煌的、自由的和创造的生活，苏联人民的牢不可破的团结和奋发的爱国主义精神，充分地表现了社会主义和民主的战无不胜的力量。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上的讲话，波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席贝鲁特在党第二次代表大会上所作的党中央委员会报告的摘要，德国统一社会党中央委员会主席、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的“德国和柏林外长会议”，法国共产党书记杜克洛的“反对‘欧洲防务集团’的斗争是法国共产党的中心任务”。
    格罗提渥的文章指出：虽然柏林外长会议没有能够在德国问题这样一个重要的国际问题上达成协议，但是，这次会议的结果仍然应该认为是完全有肯定意义的。这次会议标志着在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上跨进了一大步。柏林会议的经过有力地告诉德国人民，只有苏联才提出了解决德国问题的明确的方案，而西方国家并没有提出任何方案。苏联外长莫洛托夫关于德国问题的建议，是在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国统一的唯一建设性方案，是德国人民在争取民族的根本权利的斗争中的锐利武器。格罗提渥说：四国外长会议的结果在德国人民的斗争中展开了一个新的阶段。德国人民必须坚决地、满怀信心地把自己的事业担当起来，为实现苏联代表团在柏林会议上提出的建议而努力。
    杜克洛的文章是他三月五日在法共中央委员会全体会议上的报告摘要。杜克洛着重指出：争取在印度支那建立和平的斗争，是和我们必须加紧进行的反对“欧洲防务集团”条约的斗争密切联系着的。法国共产党人必须坚决地使工人阶级采取统一行动，使一切反对德国军国主义复活的正直法国人团结起来进行声势浩大的抗议运动。每一个党员的责任就是和一切爱国者联合起来，积极参加反对批准波恩和巴黎条约的征集签名工作。杜克洛说：反对“欧洲防务集团”必须成为我们注意的中心问题。当前的斗争要求我们每一个人彻底了解我们目前进行这场必须胜利的战斗的意义。我们必须以最负责的态度采取必要措施，发挥最大的主动性，尽最大力量为阻止批准“欧洲防务集团”条约而斗争。
