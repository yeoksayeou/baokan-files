Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 4th (TASS dispatch) – The Soviet Union's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on March 31 regarding the issue of European collective security has evoked strong reactions in countries around the world.

	United States

American government and press commentary reflects their anxiety and alarm at the reaction to the Soviet collective security plan among people around the world.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson hastily declared that the United States could not accept the Soviet proposal for establishing a European collective security system. This hasty attitude was satirized by foreign newspapers. As fairly pointed out by various newspapers in Western countries, this statement exposed America's panic and fear of embarking on discussions of the Soviet plan. The "New York Times" correspondent in Bonn also expressed anxiety about the possible reactions to the Soviet note in France and West Germany. Regarding this point, the correspondent noted: "Dr. Adenauer has never had fewer opportunities to maneuver than now."

The opponents of the collective security plan, by opposing the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have exposed their true colors, demonstrating that the current form of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an exclusive military bloc with an aggressive nature, its purpose being to oppose the Soviet Union.

	Great Britain

British public opinion has paid particular attention to the Soviet proposal. The disapproval of the U.S. State Department's statement on the Soviet note by all levels of British society is proof of this.

Reuters reported that at the House of Commons meeting on April 1, Labour leader Clement Attlee asked Anthony Eden: Is it not possible to use the Russian note as a basis for negotiations? Labour MP Harold Davies said: If Russia has no peace, then Britain cannot have peace – that is the principle of the European situation. He urged the British government to study the issue of European security seriously and sincerely, "regardless of what other governments say."

The London "Times" wrote in an editorial that the Soviet note "deserves careful study" and criticized the negative attitude taken by the U.S. State Department towards the Soviet note. The "Daily Express" pointed out: "The Russian new note itself is essentially a beneficial development, because this note proves that Russia is avoiding war." The "Yorkshire Post" editorial said that the Soviet note "is right, we need effective cooperation between all European countries to maintain and promote peace."

	France

Many members of the French Parliament strongly condemned attempts to dismiss the Soviet proposal or avoid discussing it. For example, Jacques Soustelle said: "In my opinion, the Soviet note must be studied with a sincere desire to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union has taken a very important step. We should also take a step as a response."

Many bourgeois newspapers in France criticized the U.S. State Department's attitude of refusing to study the Soviet plan. "Le Monde" emphasized that the Soviet Union has agreed to the United States participating in the European collective security system, saying: "Therefore, the balance has been restored, and there is no longer any reason to reject the study of the Soviet proposal in advance. Unfortunately, the U.S. government seems to be taking a different path…" "France-Soir" observer Patina emphasized that the Soviet plan to guarantee collective security "does not conflict with French national interests in any way, and on the contrary. However, American policy is developing in the opposite direction." "L'Humanité" supported the Soviet government's note, pointing out: "Only by establishing a universal collective security system, making it impossible and unnecessary for hostile military blocs to be established, can peace be guaranteed."

	West Germany

The Soviet proposal to establish a collective security system is a way to replace the "European Defense Community." This plan has greatly annoyed the West German ruling clique and the reactionary West German newspapers that are hysterically clamoring to reject the note. However, some West German newspapers emphasized that it seems impossible to simply kick the Soviet note aside.

The "Die Welt," published in Essen, said that after putting forward this proposal, "the Russians have already taken the initiative in international politics." Herbert Wehner, a member of the Social Democratic Party in the Federal Parliament, said, "The West cannot reply to the Soviet note with propagandists alone." On the contrary, methods to guarantee peace must be seriously considered.

	German Democratic Republic

The newspapers of the German Democratic Republic welcomed the Soviet note, regarding it as another step forward by the Soviet Union towards the establishment of a collective security system.

The "Neues Deutschland" emphasized in an editorial commenting on the note that all the reservations made by Western countries at the Berlin Conference have now become invalid. The "National-Zeitung" said in an editorial that the Soviet government's note is very important for the struggle for peace because it once again puts forward specific proposals for easing world tensions. The newspaper said: "The new proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the note are welcomed by all peace forces in Germany because these proposals aim to eliminate the danger of West German remilitarization and bring the two parts of Germany closely together due to the easing of international tensions."

	Italy

The Soviet plan to guarantee collective security has also aroused great interest in other European countries and elsewhere. The hostile comments of right-wing newspapers cannot conceal this interest.

An editorial in the Italian progressive newspaper "Avanti!" said: "The Soviet note is, and will continue to be, a milestone on the arduous road to peace in Europe and the world… This is a decisive step taken by the Soviet Union to lay the foundation for reaching an agreement on the issue of guaranteeing European peace and unity." "La Nazione" published a conversation with Riccardo Lombardi, a member of the Socialist Party, which briefly stated: There are two basic factors that can greatly advance us towards the goal of peace and easing international tensions: First, eliminating the entire aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; once all the countries that participated in the anti-Nazi and anti-fascist war have joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this organization will not be a weapon specifically aimed at countries that have not joined this organization like it is now; second, agreeing to the principle that the United States is not excluded from Europe, but participates in the European collective security system together with the Soviet Union.

	Sweden

The Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" said: "Those who oppose this treaty (the "European Army" treaty – editor) believe that the Soviet note is a document that must be carefully studied."

	Canada

Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson paid considerable attention to the Soviet government's note when he delivered a speech in parliament on April 1. He warned against groundlessly insisting that the Soviet proposal was "insincere." He also suggested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting discuss the Soviet plan.

	India

The "Times of India" said: The United States' negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal "shows the extent to which Western policy is dominated by narrow-minded views, which are unwilling to admit that only by welcoming the Soviet Union to participate in a security system that stipulates obligations and restrictions that are jointly abided by can a practical foundation for peace be established."

	Indonesia

Indonesian newspapers "Indonesia Raya," "Merdeka," and "Suluh Indonesia" all pointed out the important significance of the constructive proposals in the Soviet note.

	Poland

The newspapers of all People's Democratic countries warmly supported the Soviet government's note. Everyone knows that the governments of these countries have expressed their agreement to participate in the "Pan-European Treaty guaranteeing European collective security."

The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" said: "The Soviet government faithfully implements its consistent peace policy, and it never gives up any opportunity to promote the cause of easing international tensions. The Soviet Union's recent note to the governments of the three Western countries is a very important step taken in this regard."

	Romania

The Romanian "Scînteia" pointed out: "The Soviet government's note has proven that as long as there is a sincere desire to reach an agreement for international peace and security, ways can always be found to reconcile different and even opposing opinions."

	Hungary

The Hungarian "Szabad Nép" said: Soviet policy is not to promote contradictions, but to find common ground in order to reach an agreement on this basis.

World opinion's great attention to the Soviet note shows that the plan to establish a collective security system has now been placed on the agenda as one of the most important issues.

    苏联保障全欧集体安全的建议
    在世界各国引起了巨大的反响
    苏联就欧洲集体安全问题在三月三十一日致法英美三国政府的照会，在世界各国引起了巨大反响。
      美　国
    美国政府和美国报刊的言论，反映了他们对苏联的保障集体安全计划在世界各国人民中所引起的反应感到忧虑和惊慌。
    美国国务院的发言人急急忙忙地声明美国不能接受苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。而这种急急忙忙的态度，曾引起外国报纸的讽刺。正如西方各国的各派报纸所公正地指出的，这种声明暴露了美国的惊惶失措和害怕着手讨论苏联计划的态度。“纽约时报”驻波恩记者也对苏联照会在法国和西德可能引起的反应表示焦虑。关于这一点，该记者指出：“阿登纳博士玩弄手腕的机会从来没有像现在这样少。”
    集体安全计划的反对者们反对苏联参加北大西洋公约组织，于是就暴露了自己的真面貌，表明：目前形式的北大西洋公约是一个排他的军事集团，它具有侵略的性质，其目的是反对苏联。
      英　国
    英国的舆论特别注意苏联的建议。英国社会各阶层不赞成美国国务院就苏联照会发表的声明，就是证明。
    路透社报道：在下院四月一日的会议上工党领袖艾德礼问艾登：难道没有可能以俄国的照会作为谈判的基础吗？工党党员哈罗德·戴维斯说：如果俄国没有和平，那么英国也就不能有和平——这就是欧洲局势的原理。他要求英国政府“不管别国政府说什么”，认真诚恳地研究欧洲安全的问题。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”在社论中写道，苏联的照会
  “值得加以仔细的研究”，并批评了美国国务院对苏联照会所采取的否定态度。“每日快报”指出：
  “俄国的新照会本身基本上就是一个有利的发展，因为这个照会证明俄国在避免战争。”“约克郡邮报”社论说，苏联的照会“说得对，我们需要欧洲一切国家进行有效的合作，以维持和促进和平”。
      法　国
    法国议会的许多议员严厉谴责了想抹煞苏联的建议或避免讨论这一建议的企图。例如，雅克·苏斯戴尔说：“在我看来，必须怀着缓和国际紧张局势的诚恳愿望来研究苏联的照会。苏联已经走了很重要的一步。我们也应该走一步作为回答。”
    法国许多资产阶级报纸批评美国国务院拒绝研究苏联的计划的态度。“世界报”强调指出苏联已同意美国参加欧洲集体安全体系，它说：“因此，均衡状态已经恢复了，再也没有任何理由预先拒绝研究苏联的建议了。不幸的是，美国政府似乎在走一条不同的道路……。”“法兰西晚报”观察家帕蒂纳强调指出，苏联的保障集体安全的计划，“与法国的民族利益没有任何抵触，而且正相反。但是，美国的政策却是朝着相反的方向发展。”“人道报”支持苏联政府的照会，它指出：“只有建立一个普遍的集体安全体系，使敌对的军事集团不可能也没有必要成立，和平才能得到保障。”
      西　德
    苏联提出的建立集体安全体系的计划是代替
  “欧洲防务集团”的一个办法，这个计划使西德统治集团以及正在歇斯底里地叫嚣拒绝这个照会的反动西德报纸非常烦恼。不过有些西德报纸着重地说，看来似乎不可能干脆就把苏联照会一脚踢开。
      在埃森出版的“世界报”说，在提出了这个建议后，“俄国人已经在国际政治中取得了主动”。联邦议院社会民主党议员赫伯特·维纳说，“西方不能仅由宣传家来答复苏联的照会”。相反的，必须郑重考虑保障和平的办法。
      德意志民主共和国
    德意志民主共和国的报纸欢迎苏联的照会，认为这是苏联向建立集体安全体系又迈进了一步。
    “新德意志报”在一篇评论照会的社论中着重指出，西方国家在柏林会议上提出的所有保留条件，现在都失效了。“国民日报”在社论中说，苏联政府的照会对于和平斗争是非常重要的，因为其中又提出了缓和世界紧张局势的具体建议。该报说：“苏联在照会中提出的新建议，正受到德国所有和平力量的欢迎，因为这些建议目的在于消除西德重新军国主义化的危险，并使德国的两部分由于国际紧张局势的缓和而紧密地结合起来。”
      意大利
    苏联的保障集体安全的计划也引起了欧洲其他国家与其他地方的热烈兴趣。右翼报纸的含有敌意的评论是不可能把这种兴趣掩饰起来的。
    意大利进步报纸“前进报”的社论说：“苏联的照会是、并且今后也将是通向欧洲与全世界和平的艰巨道路上的旅程碑……这是苏联为了奠定就保证欧洲和平与统一的方法问题达成协议的基础而采取的有决定意义的步骤。”“国家报”刊载了社会党议员理卡多·龙巴迪的一篇谈话，谈话略称：有两个基本因素可以使我们朝着和平与缓和国际紧张局势的目标大大迈进一步，这两个因素就是：一、取消北大西洋公约的整个侵略性质，一旦所有曾参加过反纳粹、反法西斯战争的国家都加入了北大西洋公约，这个组织就不会像现在这样是专门针对着没有参加这个组织的国家的武器了；二、同意这样一个原则，即美国不被排斥于欧洲之外，而和苏联一同参加欧洲集体安全体系。
      瑞　典
    瑞典“晨报”说：“反对这个条约（“欧洲军”条约——编者）的人们认为，苏联的照会是一个必须予以慎重研究的文件。”
      加拿大
    加拿大外交部长皮尔逊四月一日在议会发表演说时，相当重视苏联政府的照会。他警告说，不要毫无根据地硬说苏联的建议“不诚恳”。他并建议北大西洋公约组织理事会会议讨论苏联的计划。
      印　度
      “印度时报”说：美国对于苏联建议的消极态度，“表明西方政策受偏狭观点的支配已经到了怎样的程度，这种观点不愿意承认：只有欢迎苏联参加一个规定共同遵守的义务与限制的安全体系，才能建立和平的实际基础。”
      印度尼西亚
    印尼报纸“印尼新闻报”、“独立报”与“大印度尼西亚报”都指出苏联照会中的建设性建议的重要意义。
      波　兰
    各人民民主国家的报纸都热烈拥护苏联政府的照会，大家都知道这些国家的政府已经表示同意参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”。
    波兰的“人民论坛报”说：“苏联政府忠实执行它的一贯的和平政策，它绝不放弃任何机会来促进缓和国际紧张形势的事业。苏联最近致西方三国政府的照会，是在这一方面采取的非常重要的步骤。”
      罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”指出：“苏联政府的照会已经证明：只要有为了国际和平与安全而达成协议的诚恳愿望，总能找出办法来使得不同甚至相反的意见趋于一致。”
      匈牙利
    匈牙利的“自由人民报”说：苏联的政策不是要促进矛盾，而是要找出共同点来，以便在这个基础上达成协议。
    世界舆论对于苏联照会非常注意，这表明建立集体安全体系的计划，现在已经作为最重要的问题之一而被提到日程上来。
