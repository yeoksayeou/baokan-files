    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd TASS dispatch: The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party adopted a resolution on expanding cotton production in the Turkmen Republic in 1954-1958.

    The resolution points out that thanks to the vigorous assistance of the government and the active labor of collective farmers and machine tractor station workers, the total output of seed cotton in the collective farms of the Turkmen Republic in 1953 exceeded the pre-war level by 45 percent. Many collective farms, due to the skillful use of machinery and the application of advanced working methods and the achievements of agricultural science, harvested an average of three to three and a half tons of cotton per hectare (equivalent to approximately 400 to 466 jin per mu), and even more.

    The resolution then states that the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party attach great importance to the continuous development of cotton planting in Turkmenistan, and have decided to accept the proposal of the Council of Ministers of the Turkmen Republic to increase the Republic's seed cotton production to 400,050 tons in 1955 and to 621,000 tons in 1958. The cotton planting area in Turkmenistan should reach 180,000 hectares in 1955 and 230,000 hectares in 1958. The general cotton yield per hectare will reach 2,250 kilograms in 1955 and 2,700 kilograms in 1958.

    In order to ensure a substantial increase in irrigated land area, the Kara Kum Canal and other water conservancy projects will be built. By 1955, many cotton planting operations will be fully mechanized, including hoeing and pre-planting tillage, as well as fertilization, planting, and inter-tillage. By 1958, the harvesting of unopened cotton bolls will be fully mechanized, and the harvesting of Soviet varieties of opened cotton bolls will be 70 percent mechanized.

    The resolution stipulates that during the period of 1955-1958, ten machine tractor stations equipped with production plants, residences, and cultural and social service institutions should be established in newly reclaimed areas. Large-scale construction work will be carried out on existing machine tractor stations and specialized machine stations in order to provide them with electricity and build repair shops and workshops.

    The resolution assigns important tasks to higher and secondary specialized schools in the Turkmen Republic. The Turkmen Agricultural College should train more experts; many new buildings, laboratories, and dormitories for students and faculty should be built there. Technical schools affiliated with the Turkmen Ministry of Agriculture are increasing their student numbers, and another technical school and an agricultural mechanization school are being established.

    The resolution also stipulates that five new cotton ginning mills should be built in the republic, existing cotton ginning mills should be renovated, and laborious operations in cotton storage stations should be mechanized and electrified.

    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会
    通过关于扩大土库曼棉花生产的决议
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会通过了一项关于在一九五四—一九五八年扩大土库曼共和国棉花生产的决议。
    决议指出：由于政府的大力帮助和集体农民及机器拖拉机站工人的积极劳动，土库曼共和国集体农庄一九五三年的籽棉产量超过了战前水平百分之四十五。许多集体农庄由于熟练地使用机器，应用了先进的工作方法和农业科学的成就，每公顷土地平均收获了三公吨到三公吨半（约合每市亩收四百到四百六十六市斤）的棉花，甚至还要多些。
    决议接着说，苏联部长会议和苏共中央十分重视土库曼植棉工作的不断发展，特决定接受土库曼共和国部长会议的建议，在一九五五年把共和国的籽棉产量增加到四十万零五千吨，到一九五八年增加到六十二万一千吨。一九五五年土库曼的植棉面积应达到十八万公顷，一九五八年达到二十三万公顷。一九五五年每公顷的一般棉产量将达二千二百五十公斤，一九五八年将达二千七百公斤。
    为了保证大大增加灌溉土地面积，卡拉·库姆运河和其他水利工程将要建筑起来。到一九五五年，许多植棉操作将全部机械化，其中包括锄地和植棉前的耕地，以及施肥、种植和中耕等。到一九五八年，未开棉铃的收获工作将全部机械化，苏联品种的开花棉铃的收获工作将有百分之七十机械化。
    决议规定：在一九五五—一九五八年间，要在新开垦的地区建立十个备有生产厂房、住宅以及文化和社会服务机关的机器拖拉机站。现有的机器拖拉机站和专业机器站将进行大规模的建筑工作，以便为它们提供电力，并修建修配厂和车间。
    决议为土库曼共和国的高等和中等专科学校规定了重要的任务。土库曼农业学院要训练更多的专家；那里要建筑许多新的房屋，实验室以及学生和教职员宿舍。土库曼农业部所属的技术学校正在增加学生人数，另一所技术学校和农业机械化学校正在建立中。
    决议还规定在共和国修建五个新的轧花厂，改建现有的轧花厂，并使储棉站的费力操作机械化和电气化。
