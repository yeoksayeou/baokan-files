    Develop the Silkworm Production Industry
    Zhang Weiqi
  　Wen Chunjie
    Silkworm rearing is one of the main sideline productions in China's rural areas. It is a sideline production with low cost, short time, and large income. One shi of fresh cocoons is worth about three and a half shi of rice, equivalent to the income of one and a half to two mu of rice fields. The cocoon harvest season is also the time when the rural areas are short of food, which is of great help in solving the problem of farmers' living and production materials.
    After liberation, thanks to the support of the People's Government, the production of silk and satin has developed considerably. The national cocoon production in 1953 increased by 170 percent compared to 1950; the satin production in 1953 also increased by 144 percent compared to 1950. In the past four years, the cocoons sold by silkworm farmers to state-owned companies nationwide were worth about 2 trillion yuan, which could buy 2.5 billion jin of raw grain. Especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the income from silkworm rearing accounts for almost 40 percent or more of the total income of farmers. Therefore, developing silkworm production is of great significance for increasing farmers' income, improving farmers' lives, and developing the silk industry.
    Silk has many uses. It can not only be woven into beautiful satin, silk fabrics, handkerchiefs, tablecloths, and other supplies or decorations; but also used in industry for electrical wire sheathing, rubber core thread, waterproof fishing nets, and surgical sutures. Therefore, silk sells well at home and abroad. China's silk fabrics have always had a high reputation in the international market. From the perspective of its value, exporting one ton of raw silk can be exchanged for about 94 tons of steel. The total value of silk exported by China in 1953 could be exchanged for a railway as long as the one from Manchuria to Guangzhou.
    Many regions in China have the conditions to develop silkworm rearing. In addition to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Sichuan, and Guangdong, which currently have the largest silk production, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and other provinces were also historically silkworm rearing areas. However, because cadres and the masses in many areas do not have sufficient understanding of the relationship between the development of silkworm production and national industrialization, they have not paid enough attention to the utilization of many mulberry trees, and have not paid attention to fertilizing, pruning, and protecting the existing mulberry trees, which has limited the future development of silkworm rearing to some extent. In order to actively increase silk production in a planned way, rural workers in various places should formulate specific plans for developing silkworm rearing based on the number of mulberry trees, so as to give full play to the production potential. At the same time, they should call on the masses to protect existing mulberry trees, apply fertilizer appropriately, prevent and control pests, and make full use of the edges of houses, roadsides, and high land that cannot be used for planting grain to increase the planting of mulberry trees.
    In order to actively improve the yield and quality of cocoons, it is very important to promote the improvement of silkworm breeds and provide guidance on silkworm rearing techniques. It is hoped that rural workers in various places with silkworm rearing conditions will also include raising good silkworms and producing good cocoons as part of their leadership in rural production work during the silkworm rearing season. Establishing and consolidating mutual aid and cooperation organizations for silkworm rearing, and implementing joint rearing and cultivation, has a great effect on continuously exchanging silkworm rearing experience, improving silkworm rearing techniques, and improving the quality of raw silk. For example, during the silkworm rearing period, paying attention to the comprehensive and thorough disinfection of silkworm rearing rooms and tools, ensuring that mulberry leaves are fresh, feeding frequently and abundantly, removing sand frequently, regulating the temperature, humidity, and light in the silkworm rearing room, improving the silkworm nests, and paying attention to heating in the nests, can all reduce silkworm diseases and mortality rates, increase unit yield, reduce waste cocoons that cannot be reeled, and increase the silk yield of cocoons. In the past, mixed breeding in the same area, or failing to pay attention to heating in the nests, resulted in inconsistent cocoon shapes and sizes, cocoon layer thicknesses, and pupa sizes, which increased multi-layered cocoons, affected the uneven drying of cocoons, and led to variations in the fineness of cocoon silk, reducing the reeling rate and the quality of raw silk. These phenomena deserve our attention and improvement.
    In addition, it is also very important for agricultural and forestry departments and silkworm industry administration bureaus in various places to strengthen the political and ideological leadership and technical guidance of silkworm industry cadres, so that they can work with peace of mind, solve the technical problems they raise in a timely manner, and give full play to the work enthusiasm of silkworm industry cadres. Furthermore, strengthen scientific research on silkworm and mulberry, such as silkworm and mulberry varieties, prevention and control of silkworm and mulberry diseases and insect pests, and improvement of silkworm rearing methods, so that research work can be combined with promotion work.
    China has a long history of silkworm rearing and silk reeling. If we can systematically study, summarize experience, and improve and enhance it, it will be of great significance for the future development of silkworm rearing and the improvement of silk production and quality.

    发展蚕丝生产事业
    张维奇
  　温纯洁
    养蚕，是我国农村主要副业生产之一，是成本较低，时间较短，收益较大的一种副业生产。一市担鲜茧约值三石半米左右，相当于一亩半到两亩稻田的收入，收茧季节又正是农村青黄不接的时候，对解决农民生活资料、生产资料的问题有很大帮助。
    解放后，由于人民政府的扶植，蚕丝及绸缎的生产有了相当发展。全国蚕茧生产一九五三年比一九五○年增加了百分之一百七十；绸缎生产一九五三年比一九五○年也增加了百分之一百四十四。四年来全国蚕农卖给国营公司的蚕茧约值两万亿元，能买二十五亿斤原粮。特别在江苏、浙江一带，养蚕收入几乎占农民全部收入百分之四十以上，因此，发展养蚕生产，对增加农民收入，改善农民生活，和对丝绸工业发展的作用是很大的。
    蚕丝的用途很多，不但可以织成美丽的绸缎、绫罗、手巾、桌毯等用品或装饰品；工业方面的电线包皮、胶皮蕊中线、耐水鱼网和医疗外科用肌肉缝线等，也都是用蚕丝制造的。因此蚕丝在国内外销路很好，我国的绸缎在国际市场上历来有很高的声誉。从其价值上来看，出口一吨生丝约可换九十四吨钢材，一九五三年我国出口丝绸总值就可以换回一条从满洲里到广州这样长的铁路。
    我国很多地区，都有发展养蚕的条件，除现在蚕丝产量最多的江苏、浙江、山东、四川、广东外，安徽、湖北、湖南、山西、新疆等省在历史上也都是养蚕地区。但是，由于许多地区的干部和群众，对发展蚕丝生产与国家工业化的关系没有足够的认识，以致对许多桑树尚未注意利用，使现有的桑树也没有注意施肥，整理和保护，使今后发展养蚕受了一些限制。为了有计划地积极地增加蚕丝生产，各地农村工作者要根据桑树的多少，订出发展养蚕的具体计划，以充分发挥生产潜在力，同时要号召群众保护现有桑树，适度施肥，防治虫害，并尽量利用屋边、路旁，不能种植粮食的高地，增植桑树。
    为了积极提高蚕茧的产量和质量，对改良蚕种的推广，和养蚕技术的指导工作，是非常重要的，希望有养蚕条件的各地农村工作者，在养蚕季节，把养好蚕，结好茧，也作为领导农村生产工作的内容之一。建立和巩固养蚕的互助合作组织，实行共催共育，对不断地交流养蚕经验，改进养蚕技术，提高生丝品质，有很大的作用。例如在养蚕期间，注意蚕室蚕具全面彻底消毒，桑叶要新鲜，多饲多喂，勤除沙，调节养蚕室的温度、湿度和光线，改良蚕簇，注意簇中加温，都可以减少蚕病和死亡率，提高单位产量，减少不能缫丝的下脚茧，增加蚕茧的出丝量。过去在同一地区混杂发种，或者在簇中没有注意加温，致使茧形大小，茧层厚薄，蛹体大小不一，增加了多层茧，影响了烘茧老嫩不匀，茧丝纤度粗细不等，降低了缫丝率和生丝品质，这些现象都值得我们注意和改进。
    还有，各地的农林部门和蚕业管理局加强对蚕业干部政治思想领导和技术领导工作也是很重要的，使他们能够安心工作，及时地解决他们提出来的技术问题，充分发挥蚕业干部的工作积极性。更进一步加强蚕桑科学研究工作，如蚕桑品种，防治蚕桑病虫害，改良养蚕方法等，使研究工作与推广工作结合起来。
    我国养蚕缫丝有悠久的历史，今后如能有系统地研究、总结经验，加以改进提高，对今后发展养蚕和提高丝绸产量、质量是有重大意义的。
