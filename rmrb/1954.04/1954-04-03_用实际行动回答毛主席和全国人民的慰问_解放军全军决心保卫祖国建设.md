    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd April: The national People’s Delegation to Comfort the People’s Liberation Army’s comfort visits to the PLA's various units and services have greatly inspired the PLA commanders, combatants, political workers and logistics staff patriotic enthusiasm. They expressed that they will use practical actions to answer Chairman Mao and the people's comfort and resolutely defend the country's socialist construction.
    After receiving the comfort visits, commanders and fighters of a unit stationed in the Lushun and Dalian areas of the Northeast Military Region immediately wrote more than 1,100 thank-you letters and more than 350 letters of determination to Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland, and representatives of the Comfort Delegation. After receiving the comfort visits, the 2nd Company of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces of the Northeast Military Region held a company-wide oath-taking rally, determined to respond to the people's comfort and love by learning the general line well and strengthening regularization and modernization. Tank soldiers of a certain armored unit wrote in a letter to the Comfort Delegation:
        "The kindness of the people of the motherland to us is higher than the mountains, and Chairman Mao's love for us is deeper than the sea. We must work harder to learn the art of combined arms operations in order to better defend the motherland and respond to the care of our loved ones."  People's Liberation Army coastal defense soldier Zheng Zhenhua wrote in his letter of determination: "When performing the task of guarding the motherland, I will be a hundred times more vigilant. If the enemy dares to invade, I will resolutely eliminate it."
    Chang Qing, a special-class meritorious veteran of the North China Military Region, wrote an article entitled "Determined to be a Soldier Serving Socialism." The article said that he must dedicate himself to improving the cultural level of the troops and further improve work efficiency. Shen Yunfen, a well-known second-class model typist, said that she would continue to increase the number of words she typed and complete her work tasks in a timely and accurate manner. Zhang Huizhong, a model truck driver of the Xinjiang Military Region who created a record of 150,000 kilometers of safe driving, proposed in a letter to the Comfort Delegation that he would increase his safe driving mileage to 200,000 kilometers. Combat heroes Zhang Yingcai, Gu Yongwu, and others from the Southwest Military Region also expressed their determination and gratitude to the representatives of the Comfort Delegation. Their articles and letters said: When we think of the motherland, of socialism, of the factories, mines, railways, schools, and water conservancy projects that are under construction, and of the thriving countryside, our hearts are filled with joy and our determination and confidence in defending and building the border areas are strengthened. Yuan Kezhong, a model worker from a unit of the Tibet Military Region, wrote an article entitled "Soldiers in Lhasa Send Distant Greetings." The article said that every soldier is determined to build Tibet as beautiful as the interior of the motherland. The "Iron Red Second Company" stationed on Hainan Island also wrote to Chairman Mao, saying: We are a people's armed force that you organized during the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan. For twenty-six years, under your leadership, we have advanced from victory to victory. From the 25,000-mile Long March to the People's Liberation War advancing into Hainan, we have successively won the honorary titles of "All-Round Model Company," "Consolidated Unity," "Iron Company," and "Outstanding Company." In recent years, 80 percent of our company's illiterate soldiers have improved to a cultural level above senior primary school; three platoons and eleven squads have won awards for "Excellent Cultural Learning Achievement." There has also been great progress in military studies. We assure you that under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, we will work harder to improve our military skills and political and cultural levels, unite the people of Hainan, build the coastal defenses of the motherland into iron fortresses, and strive to defend the motherland and world peace.
    During these days of comfort visits, a new atmosphere has emerged in the various units of the People's Liberation Army. After receiving the comfort visits, the repairmen of the repair company of a certain armored unit of the North China Military Region put forward the slogan "Love the Motherland, Love the People, Improve Work Efficiency" and completed all the repair tasks originally scheduled to be completed in fifteen days within seven days. Guo Shenghua, a correspondent from a certain unit of the Northwest Military Region, said: "The kind comfort visits of the Comfort Delegation made me feel energetic all over, and I don't feel tired no matter how busy I am at work." He braved wind, rain, and muddy roads, and rode a bicycle for more than 980 kilometers in a total of 80 hours, delivering various documents and letters in a timely manner. The vehicle utilization rate of a certain automobile company in the Xinjiang Military Region increased from 60 percent in the past to 80 percent in the first ten days of March.

    解放军全军决心保卫祖国建设
    【新华社二日讯】全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团对人民解放军各部队、各兵种的慰问，大大鼓舞了人民解放军指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员和后勤工作人员的爱国热情，他们表示要以实际行动回答毛主席和全国人民的慰问，坚决保卫祖国社会主义的建设。
    东北军区驻旅顺、大连地区的某部指挥员、战斗员在受到慰问后，立刻给毛主席、祖国人民和慰问团代表写了一千一百多封感谢信和三百五十多封决心书。东北军区公安部队某部二连在受到慰问后，举行了全连宣誓大会，决心以学好总路线和加强正规化、现代化的建设来答谢人民的慰问和热爱。装甲兵某部的坦克手们写给慰问团的信上说：
  “祖国人民对我们的恩情比山高，毛主席对我们的爱比海深，我们一定要加倍努力学好联合兵种作战的艺术，以更好地保卫祖国来回答亲人们的关怀。”人民解放军海防部队战士郑振华的决心书上写着：“在执行祖国哨兵任务时，我将百倍警惕。如果敌人敢来侵犯，就坚决消灭它。”
    人民解放军华北军区特等功臣常青写了一篇文章，题目是“决心作一个为社会主义服务的兵”，文中说，他一定献身于提高部队文化水平的工作，更加提高工作效率。著名的二级模范、打字员沈蕴芬说，她要继续提高打字的数量，及时、准确地完成工作任务。新疆军区创造安全行车十五万公里纪录的模范汽车驾驶员张会中写给慰问团的信中提出，他要使他的安全行车里程增加到二十万公里。西南军区战斗英雄张英才、顾永武等，也向慰问团代表表示决心和感谢。他们的文章和信中说：我们一想到祖国、想到社会主义，一想到正在修建的厂矿、铁路、学校、水利工程和欣欣向荣的农村，我们的心里就充满了喜悦，就更加增强保卫边疆、建设边疆的决心和信心。西藏军区某部模范工作者袁克忠写了一篇文章，题目是“拉萨的战士致遥远的敬礼”。文中说，我们每个战士都决心把西藏建设得和祖国内地一样的美好。驻守在海南岛的某部“钢铁红二连”也写信给毛主席说：我们是您在湖南秋收暴动时组织起来的一支人民武装。二十六年来，我们在您的领导下，从胜利走向胜利。从二万五千里长征到人民解放战争进军海南，我们先后获得了“全面模范连”、“巩固团结”、“钢铁连”、“优胜连”等光荣称号。近几年来，我们全连占百分之八十的文盲都已提高到高级小学以上的文化程度；三个排、十一个班荣获“文化学习成绩优良”的奖励。在军事学习中也有很大进步。我们向您保证：在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我们要更加努力提高军事素养和政治、文化水平，团结海南人民，把祖国海防建设成钢铁堡垒，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    在这些慰问的日子里，人民解放军各部队中呈现了一片新气象。华北军区装甲兵某部修理连在受到慰问后，修理工们提出“爱祖国、爱人民，提高工作效率”的口号，把原订十五天完成的修理任务在七天内全部完成。西北军区某部通讯员郭生华说：“慰问团对我们的亲切慰问，使我觉得浑身是劲，工作再忙也不觉得累。”他冒着风雨和泥泞的道路，在总计八十小时内骑脚踏车走了九百八十多公里的路程，及时地传送了各种文件和信件。新疆军区某汽车连在三月份头十天中出车率由过去的百分之六十提高到百分之八十。
