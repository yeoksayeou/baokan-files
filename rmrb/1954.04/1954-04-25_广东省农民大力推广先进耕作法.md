Guangdong Farmers Vigorously Promote Advanced Farming Methods

This spring plowing season, farmers in various parts of Guangdong, driven by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, have mostly adopted advanced farming methods such as selecting seeds with yellow mud water or salt water, sowing in improved seedbeds, sparse sowing for seedling cultivation, and close planting of small seedlings, laying the foundation for increased crop yields this year.

In recent years, the fact that various parts of Guangdong have achieved increased production by adopting advanced farming methods has been personally experienced by many farmers. In particular, agricultural production cooperatives, due to the unified management of land and collective labor, have greater strength to carry out agricultural technology reforms. For example, the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lanbian Township, Fourth District, Zhongshan County, this year used 1,200 dan of sandy mud on twelve mu of clay soil and 800 dan of pond mud on ten mu of sandy soil, improving the soil. In Qujiang County, more than 70% of the county used yellow mud water to select seeds, and the agricultural production cooperatives and ninety-nine mutual aid groups in Shixia Township all adopted improved seedbed sowing. In the Fifteenth District of Jieyang County, small-seedling close planting accounted for 30% of the district's paddy fields. The three million mu of sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta, thanks to being organized and vigorously developing soil and fertilizer accumulation, have created conditions for the technical reform of sandy fields, and have generally promoted local advanced farming experiences such as "converting intercropping to continuous cropping" (i.e., changing double-season intercropping rice to double-season continuous cropping rice) and "intensive planting of intercropping" (i.e., conducting appropriate intensive planting on the basis of the original double-season intercropping rice). This year, Xinhui County will have approximately 45,000 mu converted from "intercropping to continuous cropping." This year, Zhongshan County will have 500,000 mu of its 1.1 million mu of sandy fields adopting "intensive planting of intercropping," and it is estimated that this item alone will increase the county's rice production by 500,000 dan this year. The Qunzhong Township Agricultural Production Cooperative's 276.9 mu of sandy fields will all adopt "converting intercropping to continuous cropping" and "intensive planting of intercropping" this year, and it is expected to increase production by 60%. As a result of vigorously developing farmland water conservancy in various places, the conversion from single-season rice to double-season rice and from dry land to paddy fields is even more common.

    广东省农民大力推广先进耕作法
    今年春耕中，广东各地农民在农业生产合作社和互助组带动下，大部都采用了黄坭水或盐水选种、合式秧田播种、疏播育秧、细株密植等先进耕作方法，为今年农作物增产打下基础。
    最近几年来，广东各地采用先进的耕作方法因而获得增产的事实，已为许多农民所亲身体验。特别是农业生产合作社，由于土地的统一经营、集体劳动，就有更大的力量进行农业技术改革工作。如中山县四区揽边乡太阳升农业生产合作社，今年在十二亩黏土田上下了一千二百担沙泥，在十亩沙质田上下了八百担塘泥，改良了土壤。曲江县全县采用黄坭水选种的达百分之七十以上，该县石下乡的农业生产合作社和九十九个互助组，全部采用合式秧田播种。揭阳县十五区采用小株密植的占全区稻田的百分之三十。珠江三角洲上的三百万亩沙田，由于组织起来和大力开展积土肥的结果，为沙田的技术改革工作创造了条件，普遍在原有基础上推广“挣稿改翻耕”（即双季间作稻改为双季连作稻）和“挣稿密植”（即在原来双季间作稻的基础上进行适当密植）等当地先进的耕作经验。新会县今年“挣稿改翻耕”的将有四万五千亩左右。中山县一百一十多万亩沙田，今年采用“挣稿密植”的将达五十万亩，只此一项，估计该县今年即可增产五十万担稻谷。该县群众乡农业生产合作社二百七十六亩九分沙田，今年全部采用“挣稿改翻耕”和“挣稿密植”，预计将增产六成。各地由于大力兴修农田水利的结果，由单季稻改为双季稻、旱田改为水田，更为普遍。　（吴尔祥）
