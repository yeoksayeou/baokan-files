    Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Heavy-Duty Automatic Rock Drill
    The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has successfully trial-produced a Soviet-style heavy-duty automatic rock drill, and testing results show good performance.
    The heavy-duty automatic rock drill successfully trial-produced by the factory is a newest type of mining tool, manufactured according to the latest Soviet design from 1953. The entire trial production of the heavy-duty rock drill was carried out under the guidance of Soviet experts. When the cylinder body's tempering hardness did not meet requirements, Soviet experts personally tempered it. The heavy-duty automatic rock drill can rotate freely up, down, left, and right, and the drilling progress per minute can reach 275 millimeters. The most significant feature of this rock drill is its automatic device, which can be operated by a single worker, greatly reducing the labor of mining workers. This is a major contribution to the exploitation of our country's rich mineral resources.
    The rock drill testing began on March 15th. Veteran worker Wang Changhai aimed the drill bit of the rock drill at a pre-placed large rock, twisted the handle, and opened the air valve. The rock drill immediately rattled, and sparks flew as the drill bit hit the rock. In less than a minute, a deep hole was drilled in the large rock, with very good results. Currently, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory is preparing for small-batch production, and units such as the Northeast Institute of Technology, Southwest Water Conservancy Construction Engineering Office, Chuanjiang Engineering Team, and Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy have already placed orders with the factory.

    沈阳风动工具厂试制重型自动凿岩机成功
    沈阳风动工具厂试制苏式重型自动凿岩机成功，试验结果效能良好。
    该厂试制成功的重型自动凿岩机是一种最新式的采矿工具，是按照苏联一九五三年最新型设计制造的。重型凿岩机整个试制工作都是在苏联专家指导下进行的，当缸体沾火硬度达不到要求时，苏联专家曾亲自动手沾火。重型自动凿岩机可以上下左右任意转动，每分钟的凿岩进度可达二百七十五公厘。这种凿岩机的最大特点是有自动装置，一个工人就可以掌握，能够大大减轻采矿工人的劳动。这对开采祖国的丰富矿藏是一个重大贡献。
    三月十五日开始试验凿岩机。老工人王长海将凿岩机的钎子对准事先放置好的大岩石，把手柄一扭动，打开风门，凿岩机立刻哒哒地响起来，钎子碰在石头上火星直冒，不到一分钟的工夫便在大岩石上凿了一个深洞，效果很好。目前，沈阳风动工具厂正进行小批生产的准备，已有东北工学院、西南水利建设工程处、川江工程队、中南矿冶学院等单位向该厂订货。
