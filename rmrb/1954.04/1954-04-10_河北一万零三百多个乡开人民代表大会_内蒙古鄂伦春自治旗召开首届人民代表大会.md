    People's Congresses Convened in Over Ten Thousand Three Hundred Townships in Hebei
    First People's Congress Convened in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner of Inner Mongolia
    More than ten thousand three hundred and eighty townships in Hebei Province have convened their first People's Congresses. The People's Congresses of various townships have generally made resolutions to consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations for production. Sixty-two townships in eight counties, including Wanquan, Renqiu, Xinle, and Wanxian, have organized nearly four thousand farming households and established one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four mutual aid teams after the elections. In Dongwang Township, Xinle County, there were two agricultural production cooperatives in 1952, but they collapsed due to the township cadres' lack of attention to leadership. The township People's Congress resolved to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the future. After the meeting, People's Representative and Secretary of the CCP Dongwang Township General Branch, Lei Jiuwei, along with other township cadres, led the restoration of the two cooperatives and established six new mutual aid teams.
    The People's Congresses of various townships have also formulated cotton planting plans for their respective townships in accordance with the state plan. Many People's Representatives have gone deep into the masses to publicize the Party's general line during the transition period, making farmers understand the relationship between cotton planting and national industrialization. They are all willing to plant according to the state plan. Farmers in Nan Jiegou Village, Feixiang County, originally planned to plant 840 mu of cotton, but with the promotion of the People's Representatives, they have expanded it to more than 1,260 mu, completing the number required by the state plan. In order to ensure the increased production of cotton and grain, People's Representatives in Gutou Township, Dingxing County, have led farmers to harrow the land three times universally, while also repairing water conservancy facilities and installing waterwheels. Newly elected People's Representatives and township cadres also solve the masses' production problems according to the specific conditions of the area. In some townships, when the wind blows in the spring, sand often buries crops. People's Representatives and township cadres mobilize farmers to dig sand prevention ditches and build windbreak forests to avoid or reduce wind disasters. In four townships, including Nancheng and Chegu in Xinle County, there are many jujube trees, which are one of the main sources of income for local farmers. In the past, cadres did not pay attention to leading farmers in pest control, which reduced production. After the general election, the newly elected People's Representatives and township cadres mobilized more than 14,000 male and female farmers to remove more than 30,000 jin of jujube curculio eggs in more than 17,000 mu of jujube orchards.

    After the conclusion of grassroots elections, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner of Inner Mongolia convened its first People's Congress in early March.
    The people of the entire Banner jubilantly celebrated the convening of the first People's Congress of the Oroqen people. Many representatives and hunters regarded the opening day of the congress as a festival, wearing new clothes and eating good food to express their happiness. Many hunters have taken practical actions such as hunting more and doing a good job in forest protection and fire prevention as gifts to the congress.
    The representatives attending the Banner People's Congress are mainly hunters, and also include workers from agencies, cultural, educational, and health sectors, all of whom are model figures most trusted and loved by the masses.
    The representatives first listened to and discussed the report by the Secretary of the CCP Oroqen Banner Branch on the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period. Everyone expressed that they must actively hunt and produce, and further organize the people of the entire Banner, do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention, and make the Oroqen Autonomous Banner better.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Party's general line during the transition period, the congress reviewed and summarized the work of the Banner People's Government in 1953. After discussion, it affirmed the achievements and pointed out the shortcomings. It elected the head and deputy head of the Banner, ten government committee members, and representatives to attend the People's Congress at the next higher level. Finally, it discussed the various tasks of the Banner in 1954 and passed the following important resolutions:
    1.  In terms of production: Conscientiously grasp the seasonality of main and sideline production, timely supply production and living materials, organize hunters to produce so as to increase income and improve living standards, and strive to achieve a target of total income exceeding that of 1953 by 15%. It was also decided to organize one or two year-round hunting mutual aid teams to cultivate the habit of collective labor among hunters and prepare conditions for the establishment of hunting production cooperatives in the future.
    2.  Forest protection and fire prevention: Continue to implement the principle of "universal forest protection, with fire prevention as the main focus," combine with various central tasks, mobilize and organize the people of the entire Banner to participate in forest protection to ensure that no fires occur in 1954. To this end, it is necessary to continue to carry out in-depth publicity and education work, so that hunters can establish the correct concept that patriotic forest protection is a glorious cause, establish various systems for forest protection and fire prevention, turn these systems into daily living habits, and check and revise fire prevention covenants on the basis of raising mass awareness. The congress also made specific resolutions on cultural, educational, health and other work.

    河北一万零三百多个乡开人民代表大会
    内蒙古鄂伦春自治旗召开首届人民代表大会
    河北省已有一万零三百八十多个乡召开了第一次乡人民代表大会。各乡的人民代表大会一般都作出了巩固发展互助合作组织进行生产的决议。万全、任邱、新乐、完县等八个县的六十二个乡，在选举后组织了近四千个农户，成立了一千七百八十四个互助组。新乐县东汪乡在一九五二年有两个农业生产合作社，因乡干部不注意领导垮了台，乡人民代表大会决议今后要加强对互助合作组织的领导，会后乡人民代表和中共东汪乡总支部书记雷久维以及其他乡干部便领导恢复了两个合作社，还新建了六个互助组。
    各地的乡人民代表大会还根据国家计划，作了本乡的种棉计划。许多人民代表深入群众宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线，使农民明白了种棉和国家工业化的关系，都愿按国家计划种植。肥乡县南借鼓村农民原打算种棉八百四十亩，经过人民代表的推动，已扩大到一千二百六十多亩，完成了国家计划所要求种植的数目。定兴县沟头乡为了保证棉、粮的增产，人民代表已领导农民把地普遍耙了三遍，同时还整修水利和安装了水车。新当选的人民代表和乡干部，还按本地的具体情况解决群众生产上的问题。有些乡每当春季刮风时，沙土常埋坏庄稼，乡人民代表和乡干部便发动农民挖防沙沟，造防风林，以避免或减少风灾。新乐县南城、车固等四个乡枣树很多，是当地农民的主要收入之一，以前干部没注意领导农民除虫，使产量减少。普选后新当选的人民代表和乡干部，发动男女农民一万四千多人，分别在一万七千多亩枣树林里清除了枣步曲虫卵三万多斤。　（新华社）
    内蒙古鄂伦春自治旗在基层选举工作结束以后，三月上旬召开了首届人民代表大会。
    全旗人民都欢欣鼓舞地庆贺鄂伦春人第一次人民代表大会的召开。许多代表和猎民把大会开幕日当作节日，穿新衣，吃好饭，表示心里的快乐。许多猎民都以多打猎或作好护林防火工作的实际行动作为向大会的献礼。
    出席旗人民代表大会的代表以猎民为主，并包括机关和文教卫生等工作者，他们都是最受群众信任和爱戴的模范人物。
    代表们首先听取和讨论了中共鄂伦春旗支部书记关于国家在过渡时期总路线和总任务的报告，大家都表示一定要积极打猎，生产，并进一步把全旗人民组织起来，做好护林防火工作，把鄂伦春自治旗搞得更好。
    大会根据国家过渡时期总路线的精神审查总结了一九五三年旗人民政府的工作，经过讨论，肯定了成绩，指出了缺点。选举了正副旗长，十名政府委员和出席上一级人民代表大会的代表。最后讨论了全旗一九五四年的各项工作，通过了如下几项重要决议：
    一、生产方面：切实掌握主副业生产的季节性，及时供应生产资料和生活资料，组织猎民生产，使能增加收入，改善生活，争取达到总收入比一九五三年超过百分之十五的指标。还决定组织一两个常年打猎互助组，培养猎民集体劳动的习惯，给今后建立打猎生产合作社准备条件。
    二、护林防火工作：继续贯彻“普遍护林、护林以防火为主”的方针，结合各项中心工作，发动和组织全旗人民参加护林，以保证在一九五四年内不发生火灾。为此必须继续深入开展宣传教育工作，使猎民树立起爱国护林是光荣事业的正确观念，建立起护林防火的各项制度，把这些制度变成平时的生活习惯，并在提高群众觉悟的基础上检查和修订防火公约。大会对文教、卫生等工作也作出了具体的决议。　（马良）
