The Soviet Union Greatly Increases the Use of Bacterial Fertilizers This Year

This year, collective farms in the Soviet Union will use bacterial fertilizers on millions of hectares of land. The industrial sector will increase its output of nitrogen-fixing bacterial fertilizers, phosphorus bacterial fertilizers, and Rhizobium powder for agricultural production to about three times that of last year. The use of these bacterial fertilizers can help plants better absorb nitrogen and phosphorus from the air and soil, thereby greatly increasing the yield per unit area of crops. For example, the results of an actual survey by the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences proved that applying phosphorus bacterial fertilizer, worth only one ruble, once per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) of land can increase the average yield of winter wheat and millet by 1.9 quintals (one quintal equals 200 jin), spring wheat by 1.7 quintals, and potatoes by 19.5 quintals. If phosphorus bacterial fertilizer is applied to soil rich in organic compounds, each hectare of land can even increase the yield by 3 to 5 quintals of grain. Nitrogen-fixing bacterial fertilizer is also very useful. After applying this fertilizer, the average yield of grain can be increased by 1 to 2 quintals per hectare, and potatoes and vegetables can be increased by 25 to 50 quintals.

Moscow's Traditional "Children's Book Week"

The traditional "Children's Book Week" opened in Moscow on March 25—the first day of the school spring break. During this week, there will be many reader conferences, children's literature exhibitions, recitation evenings, and meetings between young readers and Soviet writers.

Many writers loved by children came to meet them. Writer B. Polevoi congratulated the children on the start of their school holiday. A. Barto, N. Goncharovskaya, Yu. Yakovlev, and other writers recited excerpts from their unpublished works. The famous novelist V. Kaverin, author of "Two Captains," answered many letters from his readers and talked about the later fates of the characters in his works. Poet E. Dolmatovsky recited some of his poems.

The Glorious Pyongyang is Recovering

In Pyongyang, the democratic capital of Korea, people enthusiastically participate in restoration work. More than 15,000 houses, more than 200 buildings, more than 80 factories, nearly 100 school buildings at all levels, medical institutions, and many cultural facilities have been initially repaired and newly built. Public utilities such as telegraph, telephone, electric lights, water supply equipment, post offices, and bus transportation networks in the city have been basically restored. The foundation projects of Stalin Avenue and Central Square have now been completed. The Moranbong Theater is being rebuilt at an accelerated pace, and the two iron bridges over the Daedong River are also being rushed to completion and can be completed soon. The large-scale International Hotel has now begun construction and a part of it can be completed within this year. Several thousand houses, six hospitals, the Academy of Sciences, a film studio, the Revolutionary Martyrs' Children's College, nurseries and other buildings will also be built this year. Moranbong Park, the stadium, and the parks in various districts will also be restored within the year. In addition, some new parks and stadiums will be established.

Czechoslovakia Reduces Prices

The government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia have adopted a decision to implement the third reduction of state-owned retail prices of consumer goods nationwide from April 1.

The decision pointed out that due to the achievements in industrial production, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs, and in order to further improve the living standards of the working people, it was decided to reduce the retail prices of consumer goods once again. This price reduction involves more than 53,000 items, which can benefit the people of the whole country by 5.6 billion crowns (Czech currency) within a year. In addition, various social service fees will also be reduced, allowing the people to benefit by 280 million crowns within a year.

The decision listed the price reductions for consumer goods. Among them, silk fabrics are reduced by 45 percent, woolen fabrics are reduced by 10 to 33 percent, cotton fabrics are reduced by 12 to 32 percent, knitwear is reduced by 11 to 40 percent, underwear is reduced by 15 to 40 percent, ready-made clothes are reduced by 10 to 30 percent, shoes are reduced by 8.5 to 30 percent, radios are reduced by an average of 24 percent, automobiles are reduced by 17.2 percent, and clocks are reduced by an average of 12 percent.

    苏联今年大量使用细菌肥料
    苏联集体农庄今年有几百万公顷田地将使用细菌肥料，工业部门为农业生产的固氮细菌肥料、磷细菌肥料和根瘤菌粉的产量将增加为去年的三倍左右。使用这些细菌肥料可以帮助植物更好地从空气和土壤中吸收氮素和磷素，从而使农作物的单位面积产量大大提高。例如，全苏列宁农业科学院实际调查的结果证明，每公顷（合十五市亩）土地上一次使用仅值一卢布的磷细菌肥料，冬小麦和黍就平均可以增产一点九公担（一公担合二百市斤），春小麦可以增产一点七公担，马铃薯可以增产十九点五公担。若把磷细菌肥料施在含有丰富的有机化合物的土壤中，每公顷土地甚至可以增产三公担到五公担谷物。固氮细菌肥料的用处也很大。施用这种肥料后，平均每公顷谷物可以增产一公担到二公担，马铃薯和蔬菜可以增产二十五公担到五十公担。
