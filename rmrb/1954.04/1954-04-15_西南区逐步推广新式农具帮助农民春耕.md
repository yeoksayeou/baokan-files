Southwest Region Gradually Promotes New Agricultural Tools to Help Farmers with Spring Plowing

The Southwest Region is promoting new agricultural tools to help farmers with spring plowing. The Southwest Agricultural Tool Factory has already manufactured more than 2,000 new walking plows for various provinces and cities. Another 800-plus units are about to leave the factory. Sichuan Province also purchased more than 3,100 pieces of horse-drawn agricultural implements in North China and other places. These new agricultural tools have been successively distributed to various promotion areas.

New agricultural tools are first demonstrated in state-owned farms and key special districts, county agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid teams, and then gradually promoted. Xikang Province takes Ya'an and Xichang special districts as promotion areas. Sichuan Province has determined Leshan, Wenjiang, Suining, and other special districts as bases, established new agricultural tool stations, and rented new agricultural tools to farmers for use. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Xikang Provincial Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government also held new agricultural tool training classes, where more than 1,200 technical cadres from state-owned farms, district and township production cadres, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid team backbones received technical training. These personnel are now in the countryside providing technical guidance on new agricultural tools. (Reported by our Chongqing correspondent)

    西南区逐步推广新式农具帮助农民春耕
    西南区推广新式农具帮助农民春耕。西南农具厂已为各省市制造新式步犁二千多部。另有八百多部即将出厂，四川省并在华北等地买马拉农具三千一百余件，这些新式农具已陆续分配到各推广地区。
    新式农具首先是在国营农场和重点专区、县农业生产合作社、互助组进行示范，逐步推广。西康省以雅安、西昌两专区为推广区，四川省已确定乐山、温江、遂宁等专区为据点，成立了新式农具站，把新式农具租给农民使用。四川省农林厅、西康省藏族自治区人民政府并举办了新式农具训练班，有一千二百多名国营农场技术干部、区乡生产干部、农业生产合作社和互助组骨干受到技术训练。这批人员现在都到农村进行新式农具的技术指导工作。（本报重庆电）
