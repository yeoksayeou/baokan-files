Xinhua News Agency: A portion of the representatives from the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army visited a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Pamir Plateau. Braving the piercingly cold wind, the delegation representatives held comfort meetings and forums with model heroes, extending deep condolences to the troops and local Party and government organs.

The entire command and combat personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Pamir Plateau expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for their concern. They presented three fox skins they had hunted to the representatives of the delegation, expressing their love for the people of the motherland. Tajik herdsmen also presented wild sheep hunted from the snow-capped mountains to the representatives of the delegation. The troops and local people also held a Buzkashi (goat grabbing) horse racing event attended by more than a thousand people.
