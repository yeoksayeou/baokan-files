Shanghai Datong Iron Factory Improves Enterprise Management After Public-Private Partnership
Completes First Batch of Shapers Twelve Days Ahead of Schedule

    After the Shanghai Datong Iron Factory became a public-private partnership, it completed its first batch of shapers twelve days ahead of schedule, something that had never happened since the factory was founded.
    Before the public-private partnership, the Datong Iron Factory suffered from backward enterprise management systems, a lack of meticulous production planning, and frequent work stoppages due to material shortages and disconnections between workshops. Generally, parts were over-fulfilled in terms of quotas, but complete machines could not be assembled and were always delivered two or three months late, affecting the production of other state-owned enterprises. Since the public-private partnership began on February 1, this phenomenon of "over-fulfilling parts quotas, but delaying the delivery of complete machines" has disappeared. Each work section launched a first-time revision of the production plan, with the revised production plan increasing by 26% compared to the original plan. Each work section also appropriately adjusted labor organization based on specific circumstances, while also focusing on strengthening weak work sections, so that each work section could organically cooperate.
    After the public-private partnership, workers actively completed the state plan with a master's attitude of labor. The scribing group in the second work section improved its operation method, increasing production efficiency threefold. The planer group used to take thirteen hours to plane a "bull head" (machine part), but now it only takes eleven hours. Planer Zhao Pengfei used to be able to plane only one large gear wheel a day, but now he can plane two and a half. At the same time, attendance rates have generally increased.
    Because workers have paid attention to product quality, the quality of this batch of shapers is also unprecedentedly good. In the past, the shapers manufactured by the factory mostly had defects such as oil leaks, and there were also instances of incomplete parts or non-conforming specifications when the machines were packed; now, the workers have improved components such as oil grooves, and the quality of this batch of shapers is all up to standard.

    上海市大同铁工厂公私合营后改进企业管理
    提前十二天完成第一批刨床的生产任务
    上海市大同铁工厂在公私合营后，提前十二天完成了第一批牛头刨床的生产任务，这是该厂建厂以来从未有过的事情。
    大同铁工厂在公私合营以前，由于企业管理制度落后，生产没有周密的计划，经常产生停工待料、车间与车间之间脱节等现象。一般零件都超额完成任务，整部机器却装不出来，总要脱期两三个月才能交货；结果影响其他国营企业的生产。自从二月一日公私合营后，这种“零件超额，整部机器脱期”的现象便不存在了。各工段开展了第一次修订生产计划的运动，修订后的生产计划比原计划提高百分之二十六；各工段并根据具体情况适当地调整了劳动组织，同时还着重加强薄弱工段，使各工段有机地配合起来。
    公私合营后，工人们以主人翁的劳动态度积极地来完成国家计划。第二工段划线小组工人改进了操作法，提高生产效率三倍。龙刨小组过去刨一只“牛头”（机器零件）需要十三个小时，现在只需要十一个小时。刨工赵鹏飞过去一天只能刨一只大牙轮，现在一天能刨两只半。同时，出勤率普遍提高。
    由于工人们重视了产品质量，这批牛头刨床的质量也空前的好。过去，该厂制造的牛头刨床，大多有漏油等缺点，机器装箱时还发生零件不全或不合规格的现象；现在，工人们改进了油槽等部件，这批牛头刨床的质量已全都合乎标准。
