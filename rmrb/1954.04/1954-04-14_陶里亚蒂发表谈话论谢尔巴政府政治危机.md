Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 13th: The Italian Scelba government nearly collapsed again on the 10th during the Lower House vote on the draft budgets of the Ministry of Budget, the Ministry of Treasury, and the Ministry of Finance.

    When the Italian Lower House voted on the draft budgets of the Ministry of Budget and the Ministry of Treasury, they were passed by a majority of only three or four votes. When voting on the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance, only 281 votes were in favor, one vote short of the statutory majority. Ten members of Scelba's Christian Democratic Party voted against it. In this situation, Leone, a Christian Democrat who chaired the meeting, disregarding the opposition of the opposition party members, declared the vote invalid on the pretext that the vote count was "incorrect," and decided to hold another vote on the 12th. The government majority group in the Lower House relied on putting pressure on the Christian Democratic members who voted against on the 10th and hurriedly called back some members who were on Easter holiday in Rome, only to barely pass the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance with 295 votes in the vote on the 12th.

    During the discussion of the draft budgets of the three ministries, members of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the Lower House sharply criticized the government's economic, financial, and tax plans.

    Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti told reporters after the Lower House meeting on the 10th: "The political crisis has begun, and if any members of the government seriously realize what has happened, then they should resign."

    陶里亚蒂发表谈话论谢尔巴政府政治危机
    【新华社十三日讯】罗马消息：意大利谢尔巴政府十日在下院表决预算部、国库部和财政部的预算草案时，差点儿又垮了台。
    意大利下院在表决预算部和国库部的预算草案时，仅以三、四票的多数被通过。在表决财政部预算草案时，赞成的只有二百八十一票，比法定多数差一票，谢尔巴的天主教民主党议员中，有十个议员投了反对票。在这种情况下，担任这次会议主席的天主教民主党人利昂纳不顾反对党议员的反对，竟借口票数计算“不正确”宣布表决无效，并决定在十二日再举行投票。下院的政府多数集团靠了对十日投反对票的天主教民主党议员施行压力，并把一些正在复活节休假中的议员也急忙叫回罗马，才在十二日的投票中勉强地以二百九十五票通过财政部的预算草案。
    下院共产党和社会党议员在讨论三个部的预算草案时，都尖锐地批评了政府的经济、财政和税收计划。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在十日下院会议以后向记者发表谈话时说：“政治危机已开始了，如果政府成员中有人认真地体会到所发生的情况，那么他们就应该辞职了。”
