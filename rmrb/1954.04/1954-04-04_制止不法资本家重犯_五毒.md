    Curbing Illegal Capitalists from Repeating the "Five Evils"

    Editor's Note: We have been continuously receiving letters from readers in various regions exposing the illegal activities of certain private manufacturers. The letters from readers such as Li Jianxun below are just three of them. From many such letters, two issues should be brought to our attention.

    The first issue is that some local people's government industrial and commercial departments, state-owned enterprises, and employees in private enterprises have failed to prevent the attacks of illegal capitalists against the working class. This must be given serious attention. Of course, after the "Five-Anti" movement, especially after the education of the General Line, the thinking and style of many private industrialists and businessmen have been transformed to varying degrees, thus enabling them to settle down to legal operations; however, the facts prove that "in a portion of industrialists and businessmen, not only have the roots of the five evils not been eliminated, but they often seize opportunities to erupt" (Li Weihan). Therefore, we must still be vigilant at all times, strengthen prevention, and any negligence will cause losses to the country and the people. Illegal capitalists have many methods and tricks to attack the working class, and their points of contact are very extensive. Therefore, in addition to the people's governments, state-owned enterprises, and workers and shop assistants in private manufacturers in various regions, the broad masses of the people must also raise their vigilance and work together to build a solid line of defense so that illegal capitalists have no opportunity to take advantage of and no gaps to exploit.

    The second issue is that a few judicial organs, when handling cases of illegal capitalists, excessively measure the size of the cases from an economic point of view, neglecting the political significance of legally sanctioning the "Five Evils" cases of illegal capitalists, thus causing undue delays in the handling of some cases. This tendency to neglect politics will more or less affect the active role of these judicial organs in safeguarding the country's socialist economic construction struggle. Here, the Beijing Municipal People's Court and its subordinate Qianmen District People's Court must be particularly mentioned. Their hesitation and unserious attitude in handling the case of illegal capitalists of the private Beixin Cotton Mill are wrong. The criminal act of the illegal capitalists of the private Beixin Cotton Mill in cutting corners and using rotten cotton to pass off as Grade A medicinal cotton, although the economic loss to the country is not very large, the loss to the business credibility of state-owned enterprises and the health of many patients is incalculable; moreover, the People's Government has long stipulated that the handling of "Five Evils" behavior should follow the principle of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future." It is hoped that the Beijing Municipal People's Court will immediately examine and correct this phenomenon and promptly give the illegal capitalists the punishment they deserve.

    Beijing Private Beixin Cotton Mill Uses Rotten Cotton Mixed with Grade A Absorbent Cotton

    Letter from Li Jianxun of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industrial and Commercial Bureau: The Baoding Branch of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation (hereinafter referred to as Baoding Pharmaceutical Corporation) ordered 4,000 pounds of Grade A absorbent cotton from the Beijing Private Beixin Cotton Mill in July last year, and a contract was signed at that time specifying the quality and specifications. Unexpectedly, in order to obtain high profits, this private cotton mill bought more than 680 catties of rotten cotton from the private Yutai Freight Yard at a price of 1,400 yuan per catty, and after processing, mixed it with Grade A cotton (12,200 yuan per pound) for delivery. Baoding Pharmaceutical Corporation did not inspect it and resold it to hospitals and health clinics in various parts of Hebei Province. Afterwards, the users reported that the cotton was not thoroughly disinfected and contained dust, grass stalks, and impurities, which were harmful to the health of patients. Baoding Pharmaceutical Corporation then transported the remaining 900-plus pounds of cotton back to Beijing on December 28 last year and demanded a refund from the factory. The factory cunningly denied it and refused to accept it. Baoding Pharmaceutical Corporation then filed a lawsuit with the Qianmen District People's Court (where the factory is located) in January.

    After accepting this case, the Qianmen District People's Court of Beijing first thought that the 900-plus pounds of cotton were not worth much, and then failed to reach a conclusion on the question of "is this a civil or criminal case," so it has not been dealt with. After repeated urging from our bureau, they replied, "The problem is not easy to solve, and it has been transferred to the Municipal Court." The Municipal Court also thought that the matter was not big and did not deal with it in a timely manner. As a result, more than 900 pounds of cotton have been left in the Qianmen Railway Station warehouse for more than two months, and its storage fee has reached more than half of its value, causing more losses to the country. To this day, this case has not been dealt with, and the illegal capitalists of the Beixin Cotton Mill are still at large.

    Jian Merchant Hou Dianyou of Wu'an County, Hebei Province, Uses the Name of Health Agencies to Purchase Medicines Through Deception

    Letter from reader Li Xinhai: Hou Dianyou, a businessman from Hedi Village, Eighth District, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, heard in Handan City, Hebei Province at the end of January that the local state-owned pharmaceutical company stipulated that private individuals could not buy more than 50 bottles of "Penicillin," so he wanted to hoard medicines and engage in speculation. He immediately went to the Handan Pharmaceutical Company and, posing as being entrusted by the Seventh District Health Clinic of Wu'an County, bought 500 bottles of penicillin. The salesperson did not ask him for proof and sold him the medicine. Afterwards, someone told the salesperson that Hou Dianyou was a habitual speculator and trickster. The salesperson then hurriedly called the Wu'an Seventh District Health Clinic to verify, and sure enough, they didn't know anything about it.

    Now, the local People's Government is investigating and dealing with this matter.

    Certain Private Manufacturers in Shanghai, Chongqing and Other Places Issue False Ordering Advertisements to Deceive Customers

    Letter from readers Liu Zhongxin and Li Rongxing, Fushun City, Northeast: Last year, the Hangzhou Private Huiluo Leather Shoe Store, the Second Joint Leather Shoe Factory, the Shanghai Private Da Shanghai and Heming Shoe and Hat Company, and the Chongqing Private Xinhua Hat and Shoe Factory and Qunyi Shoe Factory successively sent us advertisements to undertake orders. The advertisements all stated "Guarantee quality, durable, on-time delivery" and the like. Many comrades have remitted money to order leather shoes by mail. As a result, some manufacturers embezzled the payment for goods and delayed the delivery of leather shoes for two or three months; some manufacturers sent leather shoes that had already grown green mold and were about to rot to make up the numbers; some manufacturers cut corners and used pieces of tires to make soles, so that they broke after only a few days of wearing. These manufacturers use false propaganda to deceive customers and defraud them of money, and the local People's Government should punish them.

### 制止不法资本家重犯“五毒”

专栏：读者来信摘要

    制止不法资本家重犯“五毒”
    编者按：我们不断收到各地读者揭露某些私营厂商不法行为的来信。下面发表的李建勋等读者的来信，只是其中的三封。从很多这类来信中看出，有两个问题应该引起我们注意。
    第一个问题是，有一些地方的人民政府工商部门、国营企业、私营企业中的职工，对不法资本家向工人阶级的进攻失于防范。这必须加以严重注意。固然，经过“五反”运动，特别是经过总路线的教育，不少私营工商业者的思想和作风已经获得了不同程度的改造，因而能够安于合法经营了；但是，事实证明，“在一部分工商业者中，五毒劣根不只尚未清除，且经常乘隙发作”（李维汉）。因此，我们仍必须时时提高警惕，加强防范，任何麻痹大意，就会使国家、人民遭到损失。不法资本家向工人阶级进攻的办法、花样是很多的，而且它们的接触面非常广泛。因此，除各地人民政府、国营企业、私营厂商中的工人店员外，广大人民群众都要提高警惕性，协力筑成一条坚固的防线，使不法资本家无机可乘，无孔可入。
    第二个问题是，少数司法机关在处理不法资本家所犯案件时，过多地从经济观点来衡量案件的大小，忽视了对不法资本家“五毒”案件依法制裁的政治意义，因而使有些案件的处理发生了不应有的拖延。这种忽视政治的倾向，就会使这些司法机关在保卫国家社会主义经济建设斗争中的积极作用，或多或少地受到了影响。这里特别要提出北京市人民法院及其所属前门区人民法院。他们在处理私营北新药棉厂不法资本家所犯案件的迟疑和不认真态度是错误的。私营北新药棉厂不法资本家偷工减料、以烂棉花充甲级药棉的罪恶行为，尽管对国家的经济损失不算很大，但对国营企业的经营威信和对许多病人健康方面所造成的损失是无法计算的；何况，人民政府早已规定了对“五毒”行为的处理，应本“过去从宽、今后从严”的原则。希望北京市人民法院立即检查和纠正这种现象，迅速予不法资本家以应得的处分。
    北京私营北新药棉厂用烂棉花混充甲级脱脂棉
    北京市人民政府工商管理局李建勋来信：中国医药公司保定支公司（以下简称保定医药公司）在去年七月间向北京市私营北新药棉厂订购了四千磅甲级脱脂棉，当时曾签订合同注明质量、规格。不料这家私营药棉厂为了获取高额利润，竟以每斤一千四百元的代价从私营裕泰货栈买进烂棉花六百八十多斤，加工后混充甲级棉（每磅一万二千二百元）交货。保定医药公司也不检验，就转卖给了河北省各地医院和卫生所。其后各使用单位纷纷反映这些药棉消毒不净，里面含有灰尘、草棍、杂质，对病人健康有害。保定医药公司便在去年十二月二十八日把剩余的九百多磅药棉运回北京向该厂要求退货。该厂狡猾抵赖，不肯接受。保定医药公司就在一月间向北京市前门区（该厂所在地）人民法院起诉。
    北京市前门区人民法院接受这一案件后，开始则认为九百多磅药棉价值不大，继则在“这是民事、还是刑事案件”的问题上得不出结论，因此一直没有予以处理。经我局再三催促，他们才回答说“问题不好解决，已转给市法院了。”市法院也认为事情不大，也没有及时处理。结果，九百多磅药棉在前门车站仓库里搁了二个多月，它的保管费已达到了本身价值的一半以上，使国家受到了更多的损失。至今，这一案件仍未处理，北新药棉厂的不法资本家仍逍遥法外。
    河北武安县奸商侯殿有假借卫生机关名义套购药品
    读者李鑫海来信：河北武安县八区河底村商人侯殿有，一月底在河北省邯郸市听说当地国营医药公司规定私人购买“盘尼西林”不得超过五十支，就想囤积药品，投机倒把。他立刻到邯郸市医药公司去，假冒受武安县七区卫生所委托，买五百支盘尼西林。营业员也没向他要证明，就把药卖给了他。事后，有人告诉营业员，侯殿有是一贯投机取巧的行商。营业员这才急忙打电话到武安七区卫生所去对证，果真，人家压根儿就不知道。
    现在，当地人民政府正在追查处理这件事。
    上海重庆等地某些私营厂商散发虚伪订货广告欺骗顾客
    东北抚顺市读者刘忠信、李荣兴来信：去年，杭州市私营惠罗皮鞋店、第二联营皮鞋厂，上海市私营大上海、鹤鸣鞋帽公司，重庆市私营新华帽鞋厂、群益制鞋厂，先后给我们单位发来了承揽订货的广告。广告上都写着“保证质量，久穿不坏，定期交货不误”等类字样。不少同志纷纷汇钱函购皮鞋。结果，有的厂商套用货款，拖延了二、三个月才把皮鞋寄来；有的厂商把已经生了绿毛、快要霉烂的皮鞋寄来充数；有的厂商偷工减料，把零碎车胎接起来做鞋底，以致穿到脚上不几天就断了。这些厂商用虚伪宣传来欺骗顾客、诈取钱财，当地人民政府应该予以惩处。
