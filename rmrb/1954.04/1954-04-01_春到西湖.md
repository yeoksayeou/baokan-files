    Spring Comes to West Lake
    The season of warm weather and blossoming flowers has arrived in Hangzhou. The trees along the banks of West Lake are a vibrant green, and the peach blossoms on Solitary Hill are in full bloom. The bright spring scenery of the lake and mountains welcomes visitors.
    This year, West Lake appears even more beautiful than in previous years. The scenic areas along the lake, such as Solitary Hill, Su Causeway, and the Lingyin Temple, have undergone renovations. There are more flowers and trees on Solitary Hill than before. At night, illuminated by numerous streetlights, it resembles a night garden filled with blooming flowers. In the "Viewing Fish at Flower Harbor" park on Su Causeway, the large fish pond project has been completed. Construction of the Peony Garden and Fish Joy Pavilion will continue this year. The long-buried "Cold Spring" at the foot of Flying Peak in Lingyin has also been excavated. Together with the recently renovated Flying Peak stone carvings and Flying Peak Square, it makes the scenery of Lingyin even more tranquil and elegant. The Liuhe Pagoda, facing the Qiantang River, appears even more magnificent after renovation, and visitors can climb the tower for a panoramic view.
    Many beautiful sanatoriums and convalescent homes newly built in West Hill, White Jade Hill, and the Qianjiang district are preparing to welcome model workers and advanced workers for recuperation. The people of Hangzhou have also made many preparations for the arrival of tourists. The pleasure boats on the lake and the hotels on the lakefront have been renovated. Many tea houses along the lake and Hangzhou's famous handicraft factories have prepared world-renowned Longjing tea and silk fabrics and other special products. The Hangzhou Transportation Branch of the Shanghai Railway Administration is also preparing to increase train services during the spring holidays. The Hangzhou Municipal Transportation Department has specifically increased the number of buses to various scenic spots.

    春到西湖
    春暖花开的季节来到了杭州。西湖沿岸的树木已是一片新绿，孤山上的桃花正在盛开。春光明媚的湖光山色迎接着前来的游客。
    今年的西湖显得比往年更加美丽了。沿湖的风景区孤山、苏堤和灵隐等名胜，已经过一番整修。孤山区花木比前更多了。夜晚，在许多路灯照耀下，这里如同一座万花盛开的夜花园。苏堤上的“花港观鱼”公园里，大型鱼池开辟工程已完成了。今年将继续修建牡丹园、鱼乐亭。灵隐飞来峰下久已湮没的“冷泉”也发掘了出来，它和最近经过整理的飞来峰石雕和飞来峰广场，使灵隐的景色显得更加幽美雅致。面临钱塘江的六和塔修建后，景象更加宏伟，在这里，游人可以登楼远眺。
    在西山、白玉山、钱江区新修的许多幢漂亮的休养所和疗养院，正准备迎接前来休养的劳动模范和先进工作者。杭州市的人民也为游客的来临作了许多准备。湖上的游船，湖滨的旅馆，都已整修一新。沿湖许多茶室以及杭州著名的工艺品制造厂已经准备了世界驰名的龙井茶和丝织品等特产品。上海铁路管理局杭州运输分局也准备在春假期间增加列车班次。杭州市的交通机关并专门增加了通往各风景区的公共汽车的车辆。
