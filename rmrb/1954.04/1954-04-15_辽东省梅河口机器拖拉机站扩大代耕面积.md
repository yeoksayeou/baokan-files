The Meihekou Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Hailong County, Liaodong Province, has begun to help local farmers plow the land. This year, the station's substitute farming plan is 1,290 standard "qiang" (converting various operations into the workload of plowing), more than one and a half times that of last year. The service targets include one collective farm, fifteen agricultural production cooperatives, six mutual aid teams, and three local state-owned farms.

The station was established last spring and now has seven tractors, totaling 250 horsepower. In addition, there are three small stations, each with a small tractor, functioning as mechanical farming teams dispatched by the station. Last year, the land cultivated by mechanical substitute farming increased production by an average of 20 percent compared with local farmers, saving farmers' labor and expanding the influence of mechanical farming. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, farmers from various cooperatives and teams held joyous gatherings with the staff of the station. Many cooperative members and team members put on new clothes and brought out the best tea and snacks to entertain the staff of the station. (Fang Qing)

    辽东省梅河口机器拖拉机站扩大代耕面积
    辽东省海龙县梅河口农业机器拖拉机站已开始帮助当地农民翻地。今年该站代耕计划为一千二百九十标准垧（即将各种作业折成翻地作业的工作量），超过去年一倍半。服务对象包括一个集体农庄，十五个农业生产合作社，六个互助组，三个地方国营农场。
    该站是去年春季创办的，现已拥有七台拖拉机，共计二百五十马力。另外还设有三个小站，各有一台小型拖拉机，形同该站派出之机械耕作队。去年凡是机械代耕的土地，平均比当地农民增产百分之二十，并且节省农民劳动力，扩大了机械耕作的影响。今年春耕开始时，各社、组农民们纷纷和站上的人员联欢，有好多社员、组员穿上新衣服，拿出最好的茶点来招待站上的人们。（方青）
