Members of Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative Write to Anshan Iron and Steel Workers
To Learn from the Working Class's Creative Spirit to Improve Agricultural Production

Dear Comrades Meng Tai, Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and all comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:

    Since our mutual delegation visits in February, all our members have been even more concerned about you than before. Recently, from the newspapers and your letters, we learned that the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant have completed the first quarter's national production plan five and eight days ahead of schedule, respectively. Comrades of the steelmaking plant, in addition to completing the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule, have also repeatedly set the highest daily output record since the plant opened three times. In three months, cost reduction alone has saved the country sixty billion yuan. Comrades! We are so happy to see your new achievements in production!

    Your every move is encouraging us to move forward. Our agricultural production cooperative has expanded from forty-seven households to one hundred households, with more than 430 people and 152 hectares of land. In order to support the country's industrial construction, we will produce 1.4 million catties of grain this year and do a good job in sideline production such as pig and chicken raising. This year, we plan to sell 500,000 catties of rice, 70,000 catties of soybeans, and 50,000 catties of other grains to the state. In addition, we will also sell 15,000 catties of pork and 20,000 eggs. At the end of the first quarter, we have sent more than 1,500 carts of manure, all kinds of seeds have undergone two germination tests, and farm tools have been repaired. Other pesticides, firewood, fodder, etc., have been prepared. We have also summarized the achievements of promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience within the cooperative last year in order to further achieve increased production through technology.

    Although we had completed the preparations for spring plowing before the end of March, it is far behind your production achievements. In the future, we should vigorously learn from your spirit of creating wealth for the motherland, strive to improve agricultural production, support industrial construction, and enable our motherland to achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible.

                        The Entire Membership of Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative

    韩恩农业生产合作社社员写信给鞍钢工人
    要学习工人阶级的创造精神提高农业生产
    亲爱的孟泰、张明山、王崇伦和鞍山钢铁公司全体同志们：
    自从二月间我们互派代表进行访问以后，我们全体社员对你们的一切比过去更加关心了。最近从报纸上和你们的来信中，知道大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂已先后提前五天和八天完成了第一季度国家生产计划。炼钢厂的工人同志们，除提前完成第一季度生产计划外，并连续三次创造开厂以来日产量的最高纪录，三个月中，仅降低成本一项，就为国家节省了六十亿元。同志们！当我们看到你们在生产上取得新的成就时，我们是多么的高兴啊！
    你们的一举一动都在鼓舞着我们前进。我们的农业生产合作社已由四十七户扩大到一百户，有四百三十多口人，一百五十二垧土地，我们为了支持国家的工业建设，今年要生产一百四十万斤粮食，并搞好养猪养鸡等副业生产。我们今年计划卖给国家水稻五十万斤、大豆七万斤、其它粮食五万斤。此外，还要卖出一万五千斤猪肉，两万个鸡蛋。在第一季度终了时，我们已送了一千五百多车粪，各种种籽都经过两次发芽试验，农具也进行了修理，其它农药、烧柴、草料等都已准备齐全。我们还总结了去年社内推广肇源丰产经验的成绩，以便进一步做到技术增产。
    我们在三月底以前虽然已做好了春耕准备工作，但和你们的生产成就相比就差得太远了，我们今后当大力学习你们为祖国创造财富的精神，努力提高农业生产，支持工业建设，使我们的祖国早日实现社会主义工业化。
              韩恩农业生产合作社全体社员
