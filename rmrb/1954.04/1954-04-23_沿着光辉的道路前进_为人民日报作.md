	Marching Forward Along the Glorious Road
	-- Written for the People's Daily
	Soviet Writer Yi·Yilina

	A Chinese girl named Zhai Ping (transliteration) wrote a letter from Shanghai to the twelve-year-old son of Gulya Koroleva, saying:

	“After reading the book about your mother – ‘Gulya’s Path’ – like many young Chinese men and women, I was moved by Gulya’s heroism. I decided to take her as my example, to learn to live as brilliantly as she did, to learn the strong will and loyalty to the motherland that she possessed.”

	“To live brilliantly…” How well said!

	When we see how our Communist Youth League members live and work under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and how young Chinese men and women participate in the great creative labor under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we feel how consistent the youth of the two countries are. What mainly binds them together is – the glorious dedication to noble goals, and – tireless creative enthusiasm.

	How happy it is to see Soviet youth and Chinese youth preparing to learn from each other, selflessly exchanging every achievement of their own. In the arduous years of the Great Patriotic War, our youth traveled a noble and glorious road, defending the glory and freedom of their motherland, and fighting for the future of their people and the future of all progressive mankind.

	Gulya Koroleva, like many young men and women, demonstrated true bravery and pure heroism in the battle for the motherland. Gulya dedicated her young and beautiful life to this struggle. But if her life had not been interrupted so early, then the fourth height that Gulya achieved certainly might not have been her last height. (Editor's note: The original name of the book "Gulya's Path" is "The Fourth Height", which refers to the four spiritual heights of courageously overcoming difficulties in Gulya's young life, and she bravely sacrificed herself in the fourth height – the battle with the enemy.) It should be known that great achievements can be accomplished not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceful fields where grain is cultivated and grown, in the factories that produce textiles, in the workshops that produce machines, and on the construction sites where new buildings are rising day by day.

	Gulya dreamed of participating in the magnificent cause of transforming nature. She infinitely loved life and was prepared to step into any difficulty and overcome any obstacle – not just for personal narrow happiness, but for the happiness of everyone, for all mankind on Earth.

	The new generation of Soviet youth that has grown up in the post-war era is also marching along a glorious road.

	Not long ago, a new patriotic undertaking began in our country – the reclamation of virgin and fallow land.

	A series of trains from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Gorky City and other cities carried thousands of young patriots – young men and women – to Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals and other border regions.

	When departing, the young people bid farewell to their hometowns, but there was no sadness or sorrow in this farewell. The young people set off towards the distant future amidst joyful laughter, intimate songs, and youthful passion – to meet difficulties, desolation, and an unpredictable, but undoubtedly bright future. These pioneers of the new land, who responded so enthusiastically to the Party's call, are not afraid of difficulties. They know that they will have to camp according to marching life, but these young people choose their own path in life, not just seeking personal happiness and a comfortable life. These young people fully recognize the full importance of the cause they face and are full of confidence in the complete victory of this cause. Everything can be overcome by people who are inspired by noble tasks. What could be happier than working for a common cause? What's more, this labor will bring rich results to the motherland in the next few years!

	Two years later, we will gain 13 million hectares of newly reclaimed land, which means: the virgin land being reclaimed will be greater than the total area of ​​wheat fields in Australia, Argentina, France and French Morocco. This also means: we will increase more than one billion poods of grain.

	Unreclaimed virgin land must first be reclaimed, and old, abandoned land must also begin a new young life – this is what the young children of our motherland have opened up.

	When we think of the young people who bravely and cheerfully embark on this great cause of labor, we will recall more than twenty years ago some of our Communist Youth League members who voluntarily set off to the Far East and established new cities in the primitive forests and swamp areas; this city was built by the hands of the Youth League members, and out of respect for them, it was given this name: "Komsomolsk-on-Amur". We will also recall the first builders of Magnitogorsk and the huge hydroelectric power station.

	The labor heroism of our youth vividly and clearly proves – noble moral qualities, strength of will, and profound feelings. These can only be cultivated by noble tasks. And Soviet life, like the new China, presents young people with truly solemn topics.

	Young men and women participating in national creative labor – this is a huge investment in the cause of building a happy life, and at the same time, it becomes a magnificent school for young people themselves, where young people learn to apply their knowledge to vivid and practical undertakings.

	The great Marxist-Leninist ideal is currently being realized – about cultivating comprehensively developed people in a communist society, people who connect knowledge and practical activities into an inseparable whole.

	Lenin said: Without the ability to practice, any school or university is worthless.

	Our Soviet readers have found new proof of this Marxist-Leninist doctrine in the Russian translation of Mao Zedong's works.

	Comrade Mao Zedong said: “The question of knowledge is a scientific question, and it cannot tolerate the slightest hypocrisy and pride. What is definitely needed is the opposite – an honest and humble attitude. If you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality.” We read in Mao Zedong's book: “...All fields of social practical life are participated in by social people.”

	In order to become such a social person, a young and unshaped person must be gradually guided into all fields of social practical life. The wider he participates, the more complete and multifaceted his development will be.

	The advanced ranks of young men and women in our country are growing in this way, their solemnity and heroism are combined with the joy of youth and the joy of life. They bravely and tirelessly overcome all difficulties and confidently look to the future – the beautiful future of their own nation, and also to the beautiful future of all other nations who have deep friendship and consistent goals with them.

    沿着光辉的道路前进
    ——为人民日报作
    苏联作家  伊·伊林娜
    一个名叫翟萍（译音）的中国女孩子从上海写信给古丽雅·柯罗廖娃的十二岁的儿子，信里说：
    “当我读过了关于你妈妈的书——‘古丽雅的道路’以后，像许多中国青年男女一样，我被古丽雅的英雄气概所感动了。我决定把她作为自己的榜样，学习她那样光辉地生活，学习她所具备的坚强意志和对祖国的忠诚。”
    “光辉地生活……”这说得多么好啊！
    当看到我们的共青团员们怎样在苏联共产党的领导下生活和工作和中国的青年男女们在中国共产党的领导下参加到伟大的创造性的劳动中去的时候，就会感觉到：两个国家的青年是多么一致啊。主要的，有什么结合着他们，这就是——为了崇高目标的光辉的献身，这就是——不倦的创造性的热诚。
    看到苏联青年和中国青年在怎样准备着互相学习，彼此无私地交流着自己的每一件成绩，是多么高兴啊。在伟大的卫国战争的艰苦年代里，我们的青年走过了一条崇高而光辉的道路，保卫了自己祖国的光荣和自由，为了自己人民的未来和所有进步人类的未来进行了战争。
    古丽雅·柯罗廖娃跟许多青年男女一样，在为了祖国的战斗中表现出真正的勇敢、纯真的英雄主义。古丽雅在这一斗争中献出了自己的年轻美丽的生命。但是假若她的生命中断得不那样早，那么古丽雅所取得的第四高度当然可能就不会是她最后的高度。（编者按：“古丽雅的道路”一书原名“第四高度”，是指在古丽雅的年轻的生命中曾有过四次果敢地克服困难的精神高度，在第四高度——和敌人的战斗中她就英勇地牺牲了。）要知道伟大的功绩不只能够在战场上完成，也可以在那耕种着的、生长着粮食的和平田野间完成，可以在出产着纺织品的厂房中完成，也可以在生产着机器的工场里完成，在逐日增高新建筑的工地上完成。
    古丽雅梦想过，要参加雄壮的、改造自然的事业。她无限地热爱着生命，准备踏入任何困难，克服任何障碍——但不只是为了个人的狭窄的幸福，而是为了大家的幸福，为了地球上所有的人类。
    在战后年代中成长起来的新的苏维埃青年一代，也沿着光辉的道路行进着。
    不久以前在我们的国家开始了新的爱国主义的事业——开垦生荒地和熟荒地。
      一列列火车从莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、高尔基城和其他的城市载着成千的年轻的爱国者——青年和男女——到西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦、到乌拉尔和其他边境上去。
    出发的时候，青年们向故乡告别，但是在这告别中没有悲哀和忧愁。青年们在愉快的嬉笑、亲切的歌声、青年的激情中向着遥远的前程出发——去迎接困难、荒凉和不可预料的、但是无可置疑的美好的未来。这些那么热情地响应党的号召的新土地的开拓者，是不畏惧困难的。他们知道他们将要按照行军生活去露营，但是这些青年选择自己的生活道路，不只求个人幸福和舒适的生活。这些青年充分认识他们所面临的事业的全部重要性，对这一事业的完全胜利充满信心。对被崇高任务所鼓舞的人们来讲，一切都可以克服得了。还有什么比为了共同事业而劳动更快乐的呢？何况这种劳动在最近几年之内就会给祖国带来丰富的成果！
    两年以后我们将要获得一千三百万公顷新垦的土地，这就是说：被开垦的生荒地要大于澳大利亚、阿根廷、法国和法属摩洛哥种麦田地的总和。这也是说：我们要增加十亿多普特的谷物。
    未开垦的生荒地先要开垦，而旧有的荒废了的土地也要开始新的年轻的生命——这是我们祖国年轻的儿女们开辟出来的。
    当想到勇敢愉快地走向这劳动的伟大业绩的青年们的时候，我们就会回想到二十多年前同样志愿出发到远东的我们的一些共青团员们，在原始森林和沼泽地带建立了新的城市；这个城市是由青年团员们亲手建立起来的，为了敬重他们，它得到了这样的名称：“阿穆尔共青城”。我们也会回想起马格尼托哥尔斯克城和巨大的水力发电站的第一批建设者。
    我们青年的劳动英雄主义，生动而又鲜明地证明了——崇高的道德品质、意志的力量和深挚的感情。这是只有高贵的任务才能培养得起来的。而苏联的生活也像新中国一样，给青年们提出了真正庄严的课题。
    青年男女们参加全国创造性的劳动——这是建立幸福生活的事业的巨大投资，同时，这也就成为青年们自己壮丽的学校，在这个学校里青年们学习将自己的知识运用在生动实际的事业中。
    目前正在实现着伟大的马克思列宁主义的理想——关于培养共产主义社会全面发展的人们，把知识和实践活动互相联结成为一个不可分割的整体的人们。
    列宁说过：假若得不到实践的本领，任何学校和大学就一钱不值。
    我们苏联读者由毛泽东著作的俄文译本中，找到这个马克思列宁主义学说的新的论证。
    毛泽东同志说：“知识的问题是一个科学问题，来不得半点的虚伪和骄傲，决定地需要的倒是其反面——诚实和谦逊的态度。你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”我们在毛泽东的书里读到：“……社会实际生活的一切领域都是社会的人所参加的。”
    年青的还没定型的人，为了要成为这样的社会的人，必须逐步引导到社会实际生活的各个领域中去。他参加得越宽广，他的发展就越充分和多方面。
    我们国家青年男女的先进行列就这样生长着，他们的庄严和英勇是与青春的愉快、生活的欢乐相结合着的。他们勇敢而不倦地克服一切困难，并且有信心地注视着未来——自己民族的美丽未来，也注视着和他们有深切友谊和一致目标的所有其他民族的美丽未来。
