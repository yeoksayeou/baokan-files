    Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company
    Decides to Reduce Fares on the Southern Xinjiang Route
    The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company safely overfulfilled the various targets of its first quarter production plan for 1954: flight ton-kilometers reached 112.6 percent of the plan, passengers 115.2 percent, mail 118.9 percent, and cargo 113.8 percent. The flight turnover volume achieved in the first quarter of this year increased by 27.9 percent compared with the same period last year. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company is learning from the advanced experience of Soviet civil aviation and striving to reduce transportation costs. Based on the current conditions, the company has decided to first reduce fares on the Southern Xinjiang route by 23.5 percent starting from May 1.
    This will play a positive role in strengthening material exchange in the Xinjiang region and meeting the cultural needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    中苏民航公司
    决定降低南疆航线运价
    中苏民用航空公司安全地超额完成了一九五四年第一季度生产计划的各项指标：飞行吨公里达到计划的百分之一百一十二点六，旅客百分之一百一十五点二，邮件百分之一百一十八点九，货物百分之一百一十三点八。今年第一季度所达到的飞行周转量比去年同季提高百分之二十七点九。中苏民航公司学习苏联民航先进经验，努力争取降低运输成本。根据现在的条件，该公司决定从五月一日起首先把南疆航线的运价减低百分之二十三点五。
    这对于新疆地区物资交流的加强与满足新疆各族人民文化生活的需要，将起良好的作用。
