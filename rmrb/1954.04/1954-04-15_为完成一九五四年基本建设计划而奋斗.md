    The state's basic construction plan for 1953 has been largely completed. We have built dozens of major projects, and the fixed assets put into use are equivalent to 79 percent of the total investment in basic construction. We have strengthened and trained the technical forces for surveying, design, and construction, and initially become familiar with the objective laws of basic construction. These achievements in basic construction last year are favorable conditions for completing this year's basic construction tasks and an important guarantee for completing the first Five-Year Plan.
    This year's basic construction tasks are even more arduous. The state's investment in basic construction is greater, the proportion of industrial construction, especially key projects, is larger, more projects will be completed and put into production this year, and the number of projects to be surveyed and designed has also increased. Therefore, this year's surveying, design, and construction installation tasks for basic construction are not only large in scale, technically complex, and urgently timed, but also require strengthening geological exploration, transportation construction, urban planning, and other work to coordinate the progress of basic construction in all aspects. At the same time, in order to accelerate the accumulation of funds for socialist construction in our country, the State Planning Commission has proposed to the basic construction departments across the country to reduce construction costs by 8 percent this year, which requires all departments of basic construction to seriously and comprehensively improve management levels, mobilize all employees to practice strict economy, and overcome all phenomena of wasting state funds.
    The various tasks in the 1954 basic construction reflect the further growth of socialist industrial construction in our country this year, and reflect the heavy responsibility of the basic construction departments this year to arrange the progress and pave the way for the first Five-Year Plan. If we do not strive to complete this year's basic construction tasks, it will prevent projects that should be put into production from starting on schedule, it will cause our country's construction undertaking to lose a new source of accumulated funds, it will cause many unfinished projects to be crowded into the last three years of the first Five-Year Plan, and ultimately, it will increase the difficulty of completing the first Five-Year Plan. If we do not strive to complete the preparatory work for many new factories, and the factory sites cannot be determined, resources are not understood, and design data is not complete, these factories will not be able to be designed and constructed on schedule, and the full realization of the first Five-Year Plan will not be possible. If we do not strive to complete the task of reducing construction costs, we will not be able to accumulate more construction funds, which will affect the speed of socialist industrialization. Basic construction workers must fully recognize the great significance of completing the 1954 basic construction plan, must see that every brick, every anchor bolt, and every design drawing is closely related to the country's economic life, to the realization of the first Five-Year Plan, and to the speed of the country's socialist industrialization, and must make greater efforts to complete this year's basic construction plan.
    There are more favorable conditions for completing this year's basic construction plan. This year's basic construction plan was determined earlier than last year, and the plans of various departments are also more practical. We also have the construction experience of last year, and have initially become familiar with the general laws of basic construction. The technical strength of basic construction has also greatly increased last year, and has been initially rectified and tested in construction, and the political and technical levels have been improved. The construction preparation work this year has generally started earlier and is better prepared, which can avoid the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and rushed at the end last year to a certain extent. Therefore, it is possible to complete and over fulfill the basic construction plan for 1954.
    But this does not mean that there are no difficulties in completing the 1954 basic construction plan. There are still many problems in basic construction this year. First of all, some basic construction cadres and workers have blindly complacent and paralyzed thoughts. Some people think: "Last year, there was a lot of idleness and a temporary rush, and the task was completed. It doesn't matter this year"; others think "This year's preparation work is stronger than last year, there is no problem." They do not see that although the construction tasks were completed last year, many losses were caused to the state due to idleness, rush work, and chaotic management, and all these phenomena should not reappear in the construction of 1954. They overestimate last year's construction experience and this year's preparation work achievements, only seeing the favorable side, and not seeing that there are still some problems in the timely arrival of design, equipment and materials in this year's project, and the construction experience and technical strength are still insufficient. They also did not see that the construction structure is more complicated than last year, the technical and complicated projects such as metal structure and mechanical and electrical installation have increased, the proportion of construction preparation work has increased, and many new problems have come. This kind of complacency and paralysis based on one-sided understanding is very harmful, and in some places it has already affected the current construction preparation work. In order to complete this year's basic construction plan, this complacency and paralysis must be overcome.
    Secondly, the disconnection or uncoordinated phenomena between basic construction units and between basic construction work and other aspects, although greatly improved compared to the past, is still a relatively serious problem. In basic construction work, although both parties A and B have their own different responsibilities, they both undertake the country's construction projects from different perspectives; although departments such as planning, geology, design, equipment, and materials all have their own independent businesses, they are only divisions of labor under a unified goal. This department and that department are mutually restrictive and mutually influential. However, some cadres have not yet understood this interrelationship, and there are still departmentalism and local viewpoints. Within the basic construction unit, there is still a phenomenon of each holding its own, waiting and relying, and shirking responsibility; instead of actively and proactively contacting and cooperating with relevant parties. Construction waits for design, design waits for planning, equipment units wait for design drawings to order goods, and design units wait for equipment units to provide equipment data for design. The result of this mutual waiting often delays the time and delays projects that could be started earlier. The connection between basic construction units and other relevant economic departments, especially the relationship with transportation departments, commercial departments, and existing enterprises that undertake equipment and material orders, is also not close enough. Therefore, strengthening the internal cooperation of basic construction units and the cooperation between basic construction units and other aspects, overcoming departmentalism and local viewpoints, and eliminating artificial obstacles are very important to accelerate the speed of basic construction.
    Also, the lack of technical strength is still an outstanding problem in basic construction. Our construction team generally grew up in the construction of housing buildings. Its proportion of work types and technical equipment cannot fully meet the new requirements put forward after the proportion of industrial construction increased this year. Among the 65,000 fixed workers in the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau, ordinary workers and apprentices without technology account for 20,000; the types of technical workers are also extremely unbalanced, and there is an extreme shortage of metal structure, electrical installation, and mechanical installation types that are urgently needed at present. In addition, the types of work in the design department are also extremely unbalanced, and there is also a shortage of technical personnel in some exploration teams in the geological department, especially in the future when the scale of construction is larger, the lack of technical strength will be even more felt. If we cannot prepare for technical strength this year, we will inevitably be caught off guard. Therefore, all departments of basic construction must pay attention to training technical strength this year.
    Finally, there are still many problems in the various management tasks of basic construction. The organizational form of the split between administrative leadership and technical leadership of construction units is still common. The phenomenon that the operation plan cannot guide the construction and the technical leadership is lax is still common. The planning of surveying and design work needs to be further strengthened, and the blind exploration of the geological department is still very serious, which are all major loopholes in the country's construction undertakings. If our management level stagnates at this level, we will not be able to guarantee the progress and quality of the project, let alone guarantee the reduction of construction costs. Therefore, all departments of basic construction must recognize the need to improve the level of management, overcome the blindness, chaos, and waste phenomena in basic construction, and make our construction undertakings develop healthily.
    The successful completion of the 1954 basic construction plan can not only make our country's national economy move forward, and make our country's socialist construction move forward, but also this step is the key to ensuring the progress of construction, and therefore is the most important step in completing the first Five-Year Plan. The staff and workers of all departments of basic construction should give full play to their greater enthusiasm and creativity, and strive to improve their political and technical level, and shoulder the glorious tasks given by the country. The staff and workers of the factories that undertake the ordering of basic construction equipment should ensure that the equipment ordering tasks are completed on schedule. The transportation departments, commercial departments, cultural and artistic departments, public security and defense departments, and all departments related to basic construction should do everything possible to support the basic construction departments in completing the 1954 plan. The people of the whole country should continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, increase production, practice strict economy, and support the country's construction undertakings.

### 为完成一九五四年基本建设计划而奋斗

    为完成一九五四年基本建设计划而奋斗
    一九五三年国家的基本建设计划基本上完成了。我们建成了数十个重大的工程，开始利用的固定资产，相当于基本建设总投资额的百分之七十九，壮大和锻炼了勘察、设计和施工的技术力量，初步熟悉了基本建设的客观规律。去年基本建设的这些成就，是完成今年的基本建设任务的有利条件，是完成第一个五年计划的一个重要保证。
    今年的基本建设任务更加繁重了。国家对基本建设的投资更多了，工业建设的比重、特别是重点工程的比重更大了，今年内要竣工投入生产的工程更多了，要勘察设计的工程项目也增加了。因此，今年基本建设的勘察设计和建筑安装任务不仅规模巨大，技术复杂，期限紧急，而且需要加强地质勘察、交通建设、城市规划等工作，从各方面配合基本建设的进行。同时为了加速我国社会主义建设的资金积累，今年国家计划委员会已向全国基本建设部门提出降低建筑造价百分之八的要求，这就需要基本建设各部门认真地全面提高管理水平，发动全体职工厉行节约，克服一切浪费国家资金的现象。
    一九五四年基本建设中的各项任务，反映了今年我国社会主义工业建设的进一步增长，反映了今年的基本建设部门担负着为第一个五年计划安排进程，铺平道路的繁重责任。如果我们不努力完成今年的基本建设任务，就会使应该投入生产的工程不能按期开工，就会使我国的建设事业丧失了新的积累资金的源泉，就会使许多没有完成的工程拥塞在第一个五年计划的后三年里，最后，就会给第一个五年计划的完成增加困难。如果我们不努力完成许多新建工厂的准备工作，厂址不能确定、资源没有摸清、设计资料不够齐全，这些工厂就无法按期设计，按期建设，第一个五年计划的全部实现就没有可能。如果我们不努力完成降低建筑造价的任务，就无法积累更多的建设资金，就会影响社会主义工业化的速度。基本建设职工们必须充分认识完成一九五四年基本建设计划的重大意义，必须看到每一块砖，每一个地脚螺丝，每一张设计图纸都和国家的经济生活，都和第一个五年计划的实现，都和国家社会主义工业化的速度息息相关地联系在一起，必须以更大的努力来完成今年的基本建设计划。
    完成今年的基本建设计划是具有更多有利条件的。今年的基本建设计划比去年确定得早，各个部门的计划也比较切合实际，我们又有去年一年的建设经验，已经初步熟悉了基本建设的一般规律。基本建设的技术力量在去年也有了很大的增长，并经过初步整顿和施工考验，政治水平和技术水平都有所提高。今年的施工准备工作一般也都动手较早，准备较好，在一定程度上可以避免去年前松后紧的现象。因此，完成和提前完成一九五四年的基本建设计划是可能的。
    但这并不是说完成一九五四年的基本建设计划就没有什么困难了。今年基本建设中的问题还很多。首先，有些基本建设干部和职工存在着盲目自满和麻痹思想。有的认为：“去年窝工很厉害，临时一阵突击，也完成任务了，今年不要紧”；有的认为
  “今年准备工作比去年强，没有问题”。他们看不见去年虽然完成了工程任务，但由于窝工抢工，管理混乱，曾给国家造成许多损失，而所有这些现象是不应该在一九五四年的施工中重现的。他们对去年的建设经验和今年准备工作的成就估计过高了，只看见有利的一面，而没有看到今年工程中设计、设备和材料的按时到达都还有一些问题，施工经验和技术力量都还是不足的。他们也没有看见建筑构造比去年复杂了，金属结构、机电安装等技术性复杂的工程多了，建设准备工作的比重增加了，许多新的问题来了。这种基于片面的认识所产生的自满和麻痹思想，是十分有害的，而且有些地方已经因此影响了当前的施工准备工作。为了完成今年的基本建设计划，必须克服这种自满和麻痹思想。
    其次，基本建设单位内部及基本建设工作和其他方面的脱节或不协调现象，虽然比起过去已大有改进，但仍然是一个比较严重的问题。在基本建设工作中，甲乙双方虽有自己不同的职责，但都是从不同角度承担着国家的建设工程；计划、地质、设计、设备、材料等部门虽都有自己独立的业务，但也只是在统一目标下的分工，这个部门和那个部门是互相制约、互相影响的。可是，现在有一些干部还没有理解这个相互关系，还存在着本位思想、局部观点。在基本建设单位内部，仍然存在着各抱一摊，等待依赖，互相推诿的现象；而不积极地、主动地与有关方面进行联系与协作。施工等待设计，设计等待计划，设备单位等待设计图纸去订货，设计单位又等待设备单位提出设备资料来设计。这种互相等待的结果常常延误了时间，使可以争取早一些开工的工程拖延下去。基本建设单位和其它有关经济部门的联系，特别是和交通运输部门、商业部门以及承制设备和材料订货的现有企业的关系，也还不够密切。因此，加强基本建设单位内部及基本建设单位和其他方面的协作，克服本位主义、局部观点，消除人为的障碍，对加速基本建设的速度，是十分重要的。
    还有，技术力量不足依然是基本建设中的一个突出的问题。我们的施工队伍一般是在承建房屋建筑中壮大起来的。它的工种比例、技术装备还不能完全适应今年工业建设比重增加后所提出的新的要求。东北建筑工程局六万五千名固定工人中，没有技术的普通工人和学徒占两万人；技术工人的工种也极不平衡，目前急迫需要的金属结构、电气安装、机械安装的工种极为缺乏。此外，设计部门的工种也极不平衡，地质部门有些勘探队里的技术人员也是不足的，特别是今后建设的规模更大了，技术力量将更感缺乏。如果今年我们在技术力量上不能有所准备，就必然会仓皇失措。因此，基本建设各部门必须在今年切实注意培养技术力量。
    最后，在基本建设的各项管理工作上，目前也还存在许多问题。施工单位的行政领导和技术领导分裂的组织形式依然是普遍的。作业计划不能指导施工，技术领导松弛的现象还不少。勘察设计工作的计划性尚须进一步加强，地质部门的盲目勘探还很严重，这些都是国家建设事业的大漏洞。如果我们的管理水平停滞在这个水平上，我们就无法保证工程的进度和质量，更无法保证建筑造价的降低。因此，基本建设各部门必须认识提高管理水平，克服基本建设中的盲目混乱和浪费现象，使我们的建设事业健康地向前发展。
    胜利地完成一九五四年的基本建设计划，不仅可以使我国国民经济向前发展一步，使我国的社会主义建设前进一步，而且这一步是保证建设进度的关键，因之是完成第一个五年计划最重要的一步。基本建设各部门的职工们应该发挥更大的积极性和创造性，努力提高自己的政治水平和技术水平，担负起国家给予的光荣任务。承制基本建设设备订货的各厂职工，应该保证如期完成设备订货任务。运输部门、商业部门、文化艺术部门、公安保卫部门及一切与基本建设有关的部门都应该尽一切努力支援基本建设部门完成一九五四年的计划。全国人民应该继续发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，增加生产，厉行节约，支援国家的建设事业。
