    A Person Who Loves to Listen to Reports
    Yuan Shuipai
    This is a person who loves to listen to reports,
    Let me introduce his deeds to you:
    Although his work is listless,
    He never gives up listening to reports.
    Every time the secretary section issues tickets to listen to reports,
    He pays close attention to who has them and who doesn't.
    If he has one, he looks quite extraordinary;
    If he doesn't—"Huh, there's something wrong with the cadre policy!"
    Especially for reports with few tickets,
    He's happy if he has one, angry if he doesn't;
    As for general report meetings,
    Generally, he's not very interested.
    However, he still goes to listen.
    Not only does he listen, but he also dozes off,
    Yawns, coughs,
    And finally, he joins the others in a round of applause.
    Four years since liberation, not a short time,
    He has listened to at least a hundred reports.
    His notebook has gilded characters, labeled "Learning,"
    But after taking notes, he never flips through them again.
    Listening to reports for the sake of listening to reports,
    Only listening and not doing, only talking and not practicing!
    A drawer full of notebooks became a nest for mice,
    Considered his glorious achievement in "fighting" to listen to reports.

    一个爱听报告的人
    袁水拍
    这是一个爱听报告的人，
    让我把他的事迹介绍给你：
    他工作虽则没精打彩，
    听报告却从来不肯放弃。
    秘书科每次发听报告的票，
    谁有谁没有，他十分注意。
    有他，就一脸毕竟不凡的神气；
    没他——“吓，干部政策有问题！”
    特别是票子不多的报告，
    有他就高兴，没他就生气；
    至于一般的报告会，
    一般他不太感兴趣。
    可是，他听还是去听。
    不但听了，而且还打了盹，
    也打了呵欠，也咳了嗽，
    最后，还跟着大伙儿鼓掌一阵。
    解放四年，日子不算少，
    报告少说也听了百来个。
    笔记本烫金字，招牌是“学习”，
    只是记了之后，再也没有翻过。
    为听报告而听报告，
    光听不做，光说不练！
    一抽屉笔记本给老鼠做了窝，
    算是他“争取”听报告的光荣战果。
