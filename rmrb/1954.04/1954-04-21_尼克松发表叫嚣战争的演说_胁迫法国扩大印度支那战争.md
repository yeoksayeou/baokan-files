Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Because the French people and a large segment of French public opinion oppose U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's coercion of France to follow the United States in sabotaging the Geneva Conference and engaging in some kind of Southeast Asia collective defense to expand the Indochina War, U.S. Vice President Nixon delivered a "background" speech at the annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors on the 16th, blatantly threatening France, attempting to prevent it from freely discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference. This speech clearly exposed the American intention to plot the expansion of the Indochina War and the sabotage of the Geneva Conference.

Nixon stated that the United States will strive to oppose the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina. Nixon said that in order to "preserve Indochina," the United States must adopt a "firm attitude." He expressed unease about the growing pressure within France and Britain demanding a negotiated settlement to the Indochina War, and threatened the French and British governments to follow the U.S. policy of destroying any opportunity for agreement at the Geneva Conference. He indicated that if France and Britain adopt an attitude of achieving a ceasefire at the conference, the United States would take a "largely unilateral approach."

He also blatantly stated that the United States would never allow the cessation of the Indochina War, saying that if France does not continue fighting, the United States will send troops, although he acknowledged that this would be a "politically unpopular" decision. Nixon also emphasized that the U.S. policy towards Indochina is: to continue supporting the war with "aid"; to coerce France into granting so-called "independence" to the Indochinese puppets, so that these puppets are completely transformed into American puppets, and to squeeze France out of Indochina; and to use U.S. allies to take "joint action" and expand the Indochina War.

In his speech, Nixon also threatened that the Geneva Conference would have no other result than a stalemate in discussing the Korean peace issue, and the United States would not concede in any way.

After Nixon delivered this war-mongering speech, the U.S. authorities initially kept Nixon's name secret, but newspapers in London and Paris soon revealed that the speaker was Nixon. Therefore, a U.S. State Department spokesman issued a statement on the 17th regarding Nixon's speech. The statement emphasized that Nixon's speech is consistent with the U.S. government's current policy toward Indochina, and with Dulles's policy of clamoring for "joint action" against Indochina. The statement acknowledged that Nixon's statement about "using American troops" "is a possible course of action."

According to U.S. news agencies, Nixon's choice of the current timing to deliver his speech is to blackmail U.S. allies, especially France, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, and to make "psychological preparations" within the United States for direct intervention in the Indochina War.

Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: TASS, New York, April 19th: A faction of the American ruling clique advocating the expansion of the Indochina War believes that, considering the tragic experience of the Korean War, American troops should not be sent to Indochina, but rather the troops of America's allies, especially British troops, should be sent there. According to the Associated Press from Washington: Democratic Senator Douglas (Illinois) proposed on a television program that Nationalist, Australian, and New Zealand troops, as well as the 65,000 British troops currently fighting in Malaya, should be sent to Indochina.
Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Paris, April 17th: "Le Monde" quoted Parisian authorities as reporting that the U.S. government has decided to further supply Indochina with U.S. military aircraft. According to the newspaper, U.S. authorities have once again dispatched a batch of "B-26" bombers to Indochina. In addition, it was decided to quickly compensate for the losses suffered by U.S. aircraft due to the air defense forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to regularly transport various parts needed by U.S. aircraft to Indochina. "Le Monde" then pointed out: For this purpose, the United States has placed its warehouses and bases in the Philippine Islands and Japan at the disposal of the authorities managing the transportation of aviation materials to Indochina. The U.S. military command has dispatched another batch of transport aircraft to Indochina.

### 尼克松发表叫嚣战争的演说  胁迫法国扩大印度支那战争

    尼克松发表叫嚣战争的演说
    胁迫法国扩大印度支那战争
    【新华社十九日讯】由于法国人民和很大一部分法国舆论都反对美国国务卿杜勒斯强逼法国跟随美国破坏日内瓦会议并搞什么东南亚集体防御来扩大印度支那战争，因此，在刚到巴黎和伦敦去向法国及英国政府施加压力的杜勒斯才回到美国以后，美国副总统尼克松十六日又在美国报纸编辑协会年会上发表一篇“背景”演说，露骨地威胁法国，想使它不敢在日内瓦会议中自由讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。这篇演说清楚地暴露了美国阴谋扩大印度支那战争和破坏日内瓦会议的意图。
    尼克松说明，美国将竭力反对在印度支那实现停战。尼克松说，美国为了“保全印度支那”，要采取“坚决的态度”。他对在法国和英国国内日益增强的要求谈判解决印度支那战争的压力表示不安，并威胁法、英政府在日内瓦会议上追随美国的破坏任何协议的机会的政策。他表示，如果法、英在会议上采取获致停战的态度，美国就要采取“在很大的程度上单独采取的态度”。
    他并露骨地表示美国决不容许停止印度支那战争，他说，如果法国不打下去，美国就派军队去，虽然他承认，这将是一个“在政治上不得人心”的决定。尼克松并强调美国对印度支那的政策是：继续以“援助”支持这个战争；胁迫法国给予印度支那傀儡以所谓“独立”，以使这些傀儡完全变成美国的傀儡，并把法国从印度支那挤出去；利用美国的盟国来采取“联合行动”，扩大印度支那战争。
    尼克松在演说中并且威胁着说，日内瓦会议在讨论朝鲜和平问题时，除了僵局之外不会有其他结果，美国无论怎样都不会让步。
    在尼克松发表这篇叫嚣战争的演说以后，美国当局当初秘不宣布尼克松的名字，但是，伦敦和巴黎报纸不久就透露出，这个演说人就是尼克松。于是，美国国务院发言人十七日就尼克松演说发表了声明。声明强调，尼克松的演说是与美国政府目前对印度支那的政策，与杜勒斯叫嚣对印度支那采取
  “联合行动”的政策相符合的。声明承认，尼克松所说“使用美国部队”，“是一种可能的行动方针”。
    据美国通讯社透露，尼克松选择目前时机发表演说，就是要在日内瓦会议前夕大肆讹诈美国的盟国，特别是法国，并在美国国内作直接干预印度支那战争的“心理准备”。
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：主张扩大印度支那战争的美国统治集团中有一部分人认为：考虑到朝鲜战争的悲惨经验，不应派美国军队到印度支那去，而应派美国的盟国的军队、特别是英国的军队到那里去。据美联社华盛顿消息：民主党参议员道格拉斯（伊利诺斯州）在电视节目中提议，派国民党、澳大利亚、新西兰的军队以及现在正在马来亚作战的六万五千名英国军队到印度支那去。
      【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十七日电：“世界报”引巴黎权威人士的话报道：美国政府决定进一步以美国军用飞机供给印度支那。据该报所说，美国当局再次派遣了一批“B—二十六”型轰炸机到印度支那。此外，还决定迅速弥补越南民主共和国防空部队使美国飞机所遭到的损失，并经常运送美国飞机所需要的各种零件到印度支那。“世界报”接着指出：为了这个目的，美国已将它在菲律宾群岛和日本的仓库和基地交给管理运送航空物资到印度支那去的当局支配。美国军事指挥当局又派遣了
  一批运输飞机到印度支那。
