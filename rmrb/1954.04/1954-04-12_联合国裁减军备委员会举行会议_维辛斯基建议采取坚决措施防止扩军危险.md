Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 10th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on April 9th.

    At the beginning of the meeting, the Soviet representative, A.Y. Vyshinsky, made a brief statement on the illegality of the Kuomintang representative serving as chairman of the Disarmament Commission. He said: The Chinese representative to the United Nations should be appointed by the legitimate Chinese government, which, as everyone knows, is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet representative protested against the fact that the Kuomintang clique, which cannot represent China and illegally occupies a seat on the Disarmament Commission, is exercising the functions of the chairman of the Disarmament Commission. The US representative, Lodge, said that the Soviet representative's suggestion to expel the Kuomintang elements seemed unfounded. In answering this question, the Soviet representative reiterated: "The situation where the chairman of the UN Disarmament Commission is not a representative of the legitimate Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is, in any case, without legal basis."
    The Commission adopted the agenda for the meeting proposed by the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. According to this agenda, the Disarmament Commission should resolve the issue of establishing a subcommittee, as stipulated in the UN General Assembly resolution of November 28, 1953. The British representative, Dixon, after citing the Eighth UN General Assembly resolution on disarmament, suggested that the subcommittee be composed of representatives from Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and that the work plan and methods of this subcommittee be determined by the subcommittee itself.
    According to the British suggestion, this subcommittee will conduct secret research and report the results of its work to the Disarmament Commission before July 15 this year. Representatives from the United States, France, Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and Turkey supported the British representative's suggestion.
    The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, said that the Soviet Union has consistently and unswervingly proposed that some decisive measures must be taken to prevent the danger caused by the expansion of armaments, which threatens peace and brings new and more serious disasters to peace-loving peoples and all mankind. Measures must be taken to achieve the above-mentioned goals. The Soviet Union, which has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, has repeatedly proposed and insisted on these measures. For example, it did so at the Eighth UN General Assembly and at the Berlin Conference. The Disarmament Commission has a responsibility to help resolve the long-standing issues.
    Vyshinsky then said that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference specifically pointed out in the second part of its communique that it is necessary to promote a successful solution to the disarmament issue, as stipulated in the UN resolution of November 28, 1953.
    Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the Soviet Union reserves the right to supplement the British proposal after studying it.
    The next meeting is scheduled for April 14.

    联合国裁减军备委员会举行会议
    维辛斯基建议采取坚决措施防止扩军危险
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约十日讯：联合国裁减军备委员会于四月九日举行会议。
    在会议开始时，苏联代表安·扬·维辛斯基就国民党代表担任裁军委员会主席的不合法性作了简短声明。他说：联合国中的中国代表应该由合法的中国政府委派，大家知道，这一政府就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府。苏联代表对不能代表中国而非法占据裁军委员会席位的国民党集团的代表行使裁减军备委员会主席职权一事表示抗议。美国代表洛奇说，苏联代表提出的驱逐国民党分子的意见似乎是没有根据的。苏联代表在回答这一问题时再度说明：“联合国裁军委员会中不是由合法的中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表担任主席，这种情况无论怎样说都是没有合法根据的”。
    委员会通过了英、美、法三国代表提出的会议议程。根据这一议程，裁军委员会应该解决关于建立小组委员会的问题，这是一九五三年十一月二十八日联合国大会决议中所规定的。英国代表狄克逊在引述了第八届联合国大会关于裁军问题的决议后，建议由加拿大、法国、苏联、英国和美国的代表组成小组委员会，这一小组委员会的工作计划及方法由该小组委员会自行决定。
    根据英国的建议，这一小组委员会将进行秘密研究，并在今年七月十五日以前把工作结果报告裁军委员会。美国、法国、加拿大、新西兰、巴西和土耳其的代表支持英国代表的建议。
    苏联代表维辛斯基说，苏联始终一贯和不屈不挠地提出，一定要采取一些坚决的措施以防止由扩充军备所引起的危险，扩充军备威胁着和平，给爱好和平的各国人民及全人类带来新的、更严重的灾难。必须采取一些措施来达到上述目的。始终执行着和平的外交政策的苏联不止一次地提出这些措施并坚持这些措施。例如，它在第八届联合国大会上和柏林会议上就曾这样做过。裁军委员会有责任帮助解决久已成熟的问题。
    维辛斯基接着说，四国外长会议在其公报第二部分中就特别指出，必须促成裁军问题的胜利解决，这是联合国一九五三年十一月二十八日的决议中所规定的。
    维辛斯基最后说，苏联对英国的建议保留权利，在研究这一建议之后再行补充。
    下次会议定于四月十四日举行。
