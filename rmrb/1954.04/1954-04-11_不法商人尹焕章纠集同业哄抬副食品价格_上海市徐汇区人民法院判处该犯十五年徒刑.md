Illegal Merchant Yin Huanzhang Conspired with Colleagues to Hoard and Drive Up Prices of Non-staple Foods
Shanghai Xuhui District People's Court Sentenced the Criminal to Fifteen Years in Prison

Yin Huanzhang, director of the Shanghai Bean Curd Trade Association in Xuhui District and owner of the Dasheng Dried Bean Curd Workshop, abused his authority to conspire with colleagues throughout the district to hoard and drive up the prices of non-staple foods, evade taxes, and, under the pretext of handling "processing," incited vendors to go to the countryside to搶購 soybeans, disrupting market management, and has been punished by law.

Last July, the Shanghai Bean Curd Trade, through industry consultation and approval by the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, stipulated that the selling price of each board of bean curd be 7,500 yuan. Yin Huanzhang, using his authority, summoned more than 30 colleagues in Xuhui District to discuss and secretly raise the price of each board of bean curd to 9,000 yuan. Around last October, before and after the Shanghai Municipality issued the "Order on Guaranteeing the Supply of Edible Oil to the People and Strengthening the Management of the Edible Oil Market," Yin Huanzhang again used the excuse of insufficient raw materials to require vendors to bring their own soybeans to his shop for "processing," otherwise refusing to sell bean curd. Therefore, the vendors bought nearly 3,000 jin of soybeans from farmers in the four suburban areas for Yin Huanzhang at prices twice as high as the market price. Last November, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau conducted year-end audits and found that several bean curd businesses had illegal activities. Yin Huanzhang then convened a meeting of colleagues, privately printed and distributed "Daily Production Reports," stipulated that employees fill them out, attempting to shift the responsibility for tax evasion onto the employees. When the head of a tax payment group confessed their fraudulent behavior, he used the pretext of a dinner to invite seven colleagues to discuss ways to suppress this. When a labor dispute occurred in the Fuxingzhai Bean Curd Shop, he not only did not help mediate, but incited the capitalist to dismantle the motor, threatening the workers with a work stoppage. Based on these illegal activities of Yin, the Shanghai Xuhui District People's Court has sentenced him to fifteen years in prison.

The accomplice, Shen Jigen, is the owner of the Shenyuanxing Bean Curd Shop in Xuhui District. He deliberately lowered the specifications of bean curd, reduced the amount of materials used, and raised the selling price. When Yin Huanzhang engaged in various illegal activities, Shen Jigen actively participated in the conspiracy and resisted taxation. Now the criminal has been sentenced to five years of labor reform and fined 40 million yuan.

    不法商人尹焕章纠集同业哄抬副食品价格
    上海市徐汇区人民法院判处该犯十五年徒刑
    上海市豆腐业同业公会徐汇区主任委员、大生香干作坊老板尹焕章利用职权，纠集全区同业哄抬副食品价格，偷漏税款，并借口办理“加工”，唆使小贩下乡抢购黄豆，破坏市场管理，已受到法律制裁。
    去年七月，上海市豆腐业经同业议定、市工商行政管理局批准，规定每板豆腐卖价为七千五百元。尹焕章竟利用职权，召集徐汇区三十多家同业商议，暗将每板豆腐提高到九千元出售。在去年十月份上海市发布“关于保障人民食油供应和加强食油市场管理的命令”前后，尹焕章又借口原料不足，要小贩们自备黄豆到他店里“加工”，否则拒绝批售豆腐。因此，小贩便以高出市场一倍的价格，到四郊为尹焕章向农民收购黄豆近三千斤。去年十一月，上海市人民政府税务局进行年终查账，发现豆腐业有几家有违法行为，尹焕章又召集同业开会，私自印发“生产日报表”，规定由职工填写，企图把逃税责任推到职工身上。该业有个纳税组组长坦白了他们的舞弊行为，他便以聚餐为名，邀集七家同业商量打击办法。馥兴斋豆腐店发生了劳资纠纷，他不但不帮助调解，反唆使资方拆掉马达，以停工来威胁工人。根据尹犯这些非法行为，上海市徐汇区人民法院已判处他十五年徒刑。
    同犯沈纪根是徐汇区沈源兴豆腐店的老板。他故意降低豆腐规格，减少用料，并高抬售价。尹焕章进行各种非法活动时，沈纪根积极参预同谋，并抗拒税收。现在该犯被判劳动改造五年，罚金四千万元。
