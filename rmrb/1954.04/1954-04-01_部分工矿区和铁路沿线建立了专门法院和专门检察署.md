Following the spirit of the resolution of the Second National Judicial Conference, many judicial organs across the country have selectively piloted the establishment of specialized courts in industrial and mining areas and specialized courts and specialized procuratorates along railway lines. It is reported that the established ones include: specialized courts and specialized procuratorates along the Tianjin Railway Line, Harbin Railway Line, and Beijing Railway Line, and the specialized court along the Gansu Railway Line; in terms of industrial and mining areas: the specialized court of the Yipinglang Industrial and Mining Area in Guangtong County, Yunnan, the specialized court of the Forestry Area of the People's Court of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the specialized court and specialized procuratorate of the Northwest Construction Engineering, the Production Labor Protection Tribunal of the Anshan Municipal People's Court, the Production Labor Protection Tribunal of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal People's Court, and the Labor Protection Tribunal of the Shenyang Municipal People's Court. Preparations are underway to establish them at the Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine, the Zibo Mining Area in Shandong, the Yumen Oil Mine, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant.

After the establishment of these specialized courts (tribunals) and specialized procuratorates, they have already begun to handle a number of cases related to counter-revolutionary sabotage, major corruption and theft, and liability accidents, specifically demonstrating the positive role of judicial work in serving national economic construction and protecting production. After the establishment of the specialized court along the Gansu Railway Line, it sentenced Gao Bingheng and others, escaped counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the railway staff, and interrogated cases such as the accumulation of materials causing significant losses to the state and the violation of operating procedures in load-bearing capacity tests, resulting in worker casualties. The Production Labor Protection Tribunal of the Anshan Municipal People's Court sentenced Dai Changyin, a saboteur who had infiltrated the Electric Repair Factory of the Anshan Iron and Steel Locomotive Plant to carry out sabotage activities. When the Northwest Construction Engineering Specialized Court publicly pronounced the sentence in the case of Ma Tianpeng of the 304 Engineering Team, who seriously violated discipline and disrupted the order of the construction site, workers Yu Jizhong and Huang Lianglao, who had worked with Ma Tianpeng in the past, rushed from the far-away construction site to provide materials to the specialized court. The specialized court along the Tianjin Railway Line publicly tried twelve typical cases at stations such as Xinxiang and Shijiazhuang, respectively, including the case of Bai Fengqi causing a serious accident due to illegal operation and the case of Zhang Zhiying's consistent illegal operation and dereliction of duty. More than 7,500 employees of the Tianjin Railway Administration participated in the public trials, and after participating in the trials, they all recognized the importance of strictly abiding by operating procedures. The Labor Protection Tribunal of the Shenyang Municipal People's Court held a trial conference at the Heavy Machinery Plant on February 23, sentencing Wang Zhiye, a thief who had infiltrated the factory and stolen more than 60 times, stealing grinding wheels, ball bearings, etc., worth more than 15 million yuan, to five years in prison; sentencing Yang Baolin, who frequently disrupted labor discipline, was absent from work for no reason, and stole ball bearings and valuable machine parts 17 times, causing a loss of more than 9 million yuan to the state, to four years in prison; and sentencing worker Liu Xianzhang, who was of poor quality, resented the leadership for not promoting him to be a squad leader, and deliberately sabotaged production, causing four consecutive liability accidents and causing a loss of more than 20 million yuan to the state, to two years in prison; in addition, it also dealt with corruption cases and cases of negligence of duty causing work-related injuries. After the sentencing conference, the emotions of the workers in the entire factory were agitated, expressing their warm support for the court's judgment. After the conference, Yu Haiquan, a worker in the Third Workshop, immediately conveyed the content of the conference to all the workers in the group, and proactively reviewed the mistakes he had made in violating labor discipline in the past. All the workers in the group also made guarantees and re-revised the work plan, adding "guarantee not to violate labor discipline" to the plan. The workers also checked their work and revised the work system in light of the above cases. For example, the laboratory of the factory often had accidents in the past, and it immediately formulated a new work system after the meeting.

Because the employees raised their awareness in the process of participating in judicial activities and further realized that illegal operations and destruction of labor discipline would endanger production and affect the national economic construction cause, which is a violation of the law, they greatly strengthened their patriotic and law-abiding concepts. Some workers in various factories and mines in Yipinglang, Yunnan, had lax labor discipline and did not pay enough attention to safe production. From January to July last year, the entire factory and mine had a total of 404 days of absenteeism. After the specialized court of the industrial and mining area, in conjunction with the management department of the mining area, conducted labor discipline and safety production inspections, carried out legal publicity and education, and punished those who seriously violated labor discipline and cases of death and injury caused by violating safety regulations, the phenomenon of absenteeism was greatly reduced. After the Production Labor Protection Tribunal of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal People's Court publicly tried the case of Tian Wende stealing knitted goods worth more than 10 million yuan at the Lushun-Dalian Knitting Factory, the phenomenon of stealing state property in the factory was rapidly reduced. In July last year, the traffic order on the Anshan Ring City Railway was very chaotic. The Production Labor Protection Tribunal of the Anshan Municipal People's Court gave legal sanctions to lawbreakers who seriously disrupted traffic order and publicly pronounced sentences at the station separately. Since then, the traffic order on the Ring City Railway has been quickly improved.

    部分工矿区和铁路沿线建立了专门法院和专门检察署
    全国各地许多司法机关根据第二届全国司法会议决议的精神，分别有重点地试建了工矿区专门法庭和铁路沿线专门法院、专门检察署。据悉，已建立的，在铁路方面有：天津铁路沿线、哈尔滨铁路沿线、北京铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署，甘肃铁路沿线专门法院；在工矿方面有：云南广通县一平浪工矿区专门法庭、内蒙古自治区人民法院林业区专门法庭、西北区建筑工程专门法庭和专门检察署，鞍山市人民法院生产劳动保护庭、旅大市人民法院生产劳动保护庭和沈阳市人民法院劳动保护庭。正在着手建立的有：唐山开滦煤矿、山东淄博矿区、玉门油矿、太原钢铁厂、重庆钢铁厂等处。
    这些专门法院（庭）和专门检察署建立后，都已开始办理了若干有关反革命破坏和重大的贪污盗窃、责任事故等案件，具体显示了司法工作为国家经济建设服务、保护生产的积极作用。甘肃铁路沿线专门法院成立后，判处了混入铁路职工中的在逃反革命分子郜秉恒等，审讯了积压材料使国家遭受重大损失和试验承载力违反操作规程、造成工人伤亡事故等案件。鞍山市人民法院生产劳动保护庭判处了混入鞍钢机车厂电修厂进行破坏活动的破坏分子戴长印。西北建筑工程专门法庭公开宣判三○四工程队马天鹏严重违反纪律、破坏工地秩序一案时，过去曾和马天鹏在一起工作的工人于继忠、黄梁老等，从很远的工地赶来，向专门法庭提供材料。天津铁路沿线专门法院分别在新乡、石家庄等站公开审判了白凤岐违章作业造成严重事故案和张志英一贯违章作业、玩忽职守案等十二起典型案件。天津铁路管理局有七千五百多职工参加了公开审判，他们在参加审判后，都认识到严格遵守操作规程的重要性。沈阳市人民法院劳动保护庭于二月二十三日深入重型机器厂召开审判大会，判处混入该厂盗窃六十多次，盗走砂轮、滚珠等价值一千五百多万元的盗窃犯王治业五年徒刑；判处经常破坏劳动纪律，无故旷工，并先后盗窃滚珠及贵重机器零件十七次，给国家造成九百多万元损失的杨宝林四年徒刑；判处品质恶劣，曾因不提拔自己当班长怀恨领导，进而故意破坏生产，连续造成四次责任事故，给国家造成两千多万元损失的工人刘显章两年徒刑；此外并处理了贪污案件和玩忽职守造成工伤事故的案件。宣判大会后，全厂工人情绪激昂，表示热烈拥护法院的判决。第三车间工人于海权开完大会回车间后，马上向全组工人进行了传达，主动检讨了过去违犯劳动纪律的错误。全组工人也都提出保证，并重新修订了工作计划，将“保证不违犯劳动纪律”加入计划中。工人们还结合以上案件，检查了自己的工作，修订了工作制度。如该厂化验室过去经常出事故，会后马上拟定了新的工作制度。
    由于职工们在参加司法活动的过程中，提高了觉悟，进一步认识到违章作业，破坏劳动纪律，就会危害生产，影响国家经济建设事业，就是犯法行为，因此，大大加强了爱国守法观念。云南一平浪各厂、矿工人有的劳动纪律松弛，对安全生产重视不够。去年从一月到七月全厂矿共旷工四百零四天。经过工矿区专门法庭结合该矿区管理部门进行劳动纪律和安全生产检查，展开法纪宣传教育，并惩处了严重违反劳动纪律的分子和因违反安全规程造成死伤的案件后，旷工现象大大减少。旅大市人民法院生产劳动保护庭在旅大针织厂公开审判了田文德盗窃价值一千余万元针织品的案件后，该厂盗窃国家财产现象迅速减少。鞍山环市铁路去年七月间交通秩序很混乱，鞍山市人民法院生产劳动保护庭对严重破坏交通秩序的违法分子给以法律处分，并分别在车站公开宣判，从此，环市铁路的交通秩序很快得到改进。
