    Strive to Manufacture More New Products
    Lu Chaoqi
    Strengthening the trial manufacturing and production of new products, and expanding the variety of products in a planned manner, to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives to the greatest extent possible under existing equipment conditions, is one of the important tasks of existing industrial enterprises.
    In the past few years, many industrial enterprises have manufactured many new products according to the needs of national construction and people's lives. Hundreds of important new products were successfully trial-produced last year alone. As a result, our country's construction projects can now obtain large-sized steel materials domestically, railway construction can obtain a large amount of heavy steel rails domestically, and the machine-building industry can obtain seamless steel pipes for boilers and high-speed tool raw materials domestically. As a result, key construction projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company can be armed with domestically-made 20,000 kVA transformers and high-voltage power cables of 10,000 volts or more; our country's newly built hydropower plants can operate with domestically-made power generation equipment; and Shanghai can use 15,000 kVA transformers to build a new power grid, supplying sufficient power for the city's industrial production. The successful manufacture of these new products has not only promoted the progress of our country's industrialization, but also improved the technical level of our country's industrial production, laying a favorable foundation for future development towards higher manufacturing technology levels.
    However, existing industrial products are far from meeting the needs of national construction and people's lives. The 141 projects that the Soviet Union is helping our country build require our machine-building industry to supply 30 to 50 percent of the main and auxiliary equipment. Our country's own construction projects and the transformation of existing enterprises also require the machinery industry to supply a variety of equipment. This year, the state requires the machinery industry sector to supply more than 600 major new products, including complete sets of equipment for thermal power plants, hydropower plants, coking plants, cement plants, paper mills, and non-ferrous metal ore dressing, as well as auxiliary equipment for key construction projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. This year, the state requires the heavy industry sector to successfully trial-produce hundreds of new types of steel, including non-ferrous metal materials and chemical industrial products. At the same time, this year the state also requires the light industry and textile industries to increase the variety of product designs in a planned manner. These new product trial manufacturing plans are an important part of the national plan. This is a task that concerns the speed of our country's industrialization and must be treated with a serious attitude.
    At present, some factories, especially machine-building factories, have stockpiles of products because some products do not meet the needs of the country, or they do not have enough order tasks. On the other hand, the products urgently needed by the country have not been manufactured. As a result, equipment and workers are idle. For these factories, strengthening the trial manufacturing of new products and expanding the variety of products in a planned manner is a way to open up sales channels and fully utilize the potential strength of enterprises.
    The trial manufacturing of new products, especially the trial manufacturing of new means of production, has certain difficulties. This is because most new products are manufactured according to Soviet advanced design standards, the structure is more complex, and the technical requirements are more strict. A certain number of engineering and technical personnel with a certain technical level are needed to design and guide the trial manufacturing, and workers with rich technical experience are needed to trial manufacture. This is one aspect. On the other hand, our country's original industry was underdeveloped, the manufacturing technology was not high, and the equipment was not perfect, which also caused certain difficulties in the manufacturing of new products. However, in order to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives, we must resolutely overcome these difficulties, and these difficulties can also be overcome. For example, when the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant manufactured a heavy-duty crusher for the metallurgical industry last year that crushed 800 tons of ore per hour, there was no sand box suitable for casting a large bed. Chen Fuli, a technical staff member who came from a worker background, came up with the "horizontal type" method for casting; there was no annealing kiln suitable for annealing large parts, so the annealing group workers built a large annealing kiln themselves; there was no equipment for processing the 19-ton "large frame," so the technical staff and workers studied how to overcome the difficulties with five sets of special equipment. When the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant manufactured a 6,000 kW hydro-turbine generator and the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory manufactured a 6,000 kW water turbine, the large parts were cast and processed with the help of fraternal factories. When the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant manufactured Soviet-style large lathes, the main parts were bent and unqualified during processing because the workers' skills were not high. However, the workers conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and adopted new processing methods, which not only overcame the difficulties but also improved the workers' technical level. These facts show that as long as we rely on the combination of workers and engineering and technical personnel and give play to their creativity; as long as we actively obtain the cooperation of fraternal factories; as long as we conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and advanced Soviet experience, we can not only overcome difficulties, but also gradually improve our country's backward technical level through the manufacture of new products.
    Some comrades in some factories believe that the trial manufacturing of new products is troublesome, overemphasize the difficulties in trial manufacturing, and do not actively and positively overcome the difficulties; some comrades unrealistically emphasize production specialization, even singularization, thinking that the trial manufacturing of new products will hinder planned management and disrupt balanced production. Therefore, they are unwilling to accept the task of trial manufacturing new products. Some factory leaders would rather let products that are not suitable for social needs or that are already in oversupply be stockpiled, and would rather let equipment and labor be idle, than accept the task of trial manufacturing new products. Even if they reluctantly accept it, they do not seriously complete it. This kind of thinking is obviously wrong. In order to give full play to the characteristics and equipment capabilities of enterprises, so as to better meet social needs, it is possible and necessary to implement appropriate specialization of labor. However, specialization of labor should also take into account the overall needs. At present, national construction and people's lives require thousands of products, and it is impossible for our country to build a factory for every product. Therefore, one-sidedly emphasizing product singularization is not realistic. It is undeniable that with more product varieties, it will be more complicated to implement planned management and organize balanced production. However, it would be wrong to think that increasing product varieties will hinder planned management and disrupt balanced production. Many factories that produce multiple products, such as the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, which produces 20 or 30 types of products every year, can't they also implement planned management and organize balanced production?
    Many enterprise leading cadres also lack a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of increasing new products, and do not realize that the planned mass production of new products to meet the needs of the ever-growing national economy is a serious economic and political task for existing industries. They believe that the new product trial manufacturing plan is not like the enterprise production plan, which must be completed, but can be completed or not. Therefore, they have relaxed the specific leadership of the new product trial manufacturing work, relaxed the inspection, supervision, and organization work. Some factories assign the task of trial manufacturing new products to the technical department or a few engineering and technical personnel to be responsible for, without organizing all departments and workshops in the factory to cooperate; during the trial manufacturing process, they do not provide solutions when there are no materials, no tools, or insufficient equipment. Some factories squeeze out trial manufacturing work when rushing production tasks, making the trial manufacturing of new products in a state of intermittent, so that the new product trial manufacturing plan cannot be completed on schedule, affecting the progress of the national construction cause. For example, the failure of the original Northeast Electric Engineering No. 15 Factory to complete the new product trial manufacturing plan in a timely manner prevented the Ningxia Power Plant from transmitting electricity in a timely manner and a newly built factory in Northeast China from starting production in a timely manner. Factories that are responsible for the task of trial manufacturing new products should learn from this lesson and effectively strengthen the leadership of the new product trial manufacturing work. The trial manufacturing of new products involves the work of all departments and workshops in the factory, and no department or workshop can complete it alone. Therefore, the factory's leading cadres must organize the forces of all departments to provide unified leadership, and include the materials, tools, equipment, and labor required for the trial manufacturing of new products in the enterprise's operation plan, and put the new product trial manufacturing plan as part of the enterprise plan, placing the new product trial manufacturing plan on a reliable foundation.
    The task of manufacturing new products must be completed by relying on the high enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees. In the past, some factories did not formulate a reward system suitable for the trial manufacturing of new products, and did not explain to the employees the political significance of the trial manufacturing of new products, so that some employees were afraid that the technical complexity and unfamiliarity of the new products would affect their wage income, and were unwilling to undertake the task of trial manufacturing new products. In the future, in addition to formulating a reasonable reward system to ensure the wage income of employees participating in the trial manufacturing, the party organizations and trade union organizations in enterprises must also strengthen political education on manufacturing new products for employees in conjunction with the publicity of the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, so that employees understand the relationship between each new product and the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, thereby consciously improving their skills, overcoming difficulties, and striving to complete the new product manufacturing plan!

    努力制造更多的新产品
    陆超祺
    加强新产品的试制和制造，有计划地扩大产品品种，在现有的设备条件下，最大限度地满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，是现有工业企业的重要任务之一。
    几年来，许多工业企业根据国家建设和人民生活的需要，制造了很多新的产品。去年试制成功的重要的新产品就有数百种之多。结果就使得我国的建设工程可以开始从国内得到大型的钢材，铁路建设可以从国内得到大量的重型钢轨，机器制造工业可以从国内得到锅炉的无缝钢管及高速工具原料。结果也就使鞍山钢铁公司等重点建设工程，能以我国自制的二万仟伏安的变压器、一万伏以上的高压电力电缆来武装自己；我国新建的水力发电厂就能以自制的发电设备来运转；上海市就能以一万五仟伏安的变压器来建设新的电力网，给全市的工业生产供应充足的电力。这些新产品的制造成功，一方面推动了我国工业化事业的进展，另一方面也提高了我国工业生产的技术水平，为今后向更高的制造技术水平发展打下了有利的基础。
    但是，现有的工业产品还远远不能满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项工程，就要求我国机械制造工业供应百分之三十到五十的主要设备和辅助设备。我国自己建设的工程和现有企业的改造，也要求机械工业供应各种各样的设备。今年，国家就需要机械工业部门供应六百多种主要的新产品，其中有火力发电厂、水力发电厂、炼焦厂、水泥厂、造纸厂和有色金属选矿等的成套设备，有鞍山钢铁公司及第一汽车制造厂等重点建设工程的附属设备。今年国家要求重工业部门必须试制成功数百种新的钢材，其中有有色金属材料及化学工业品。同时，今年国家也要求轻工业和纺织工业有计划地增加产品的花色。这些新产品试制计划是国家计划的重要组成部分，这是关系着我国工业化速度的一个任务，必须以严肃的态度来对待它。
    目前有些工厂，特别是机械制造工厂，因有若干产品不适合国家的需要，因而产品积压，或者没有足够的订货任务，而另一方面，国家所急需的产品又没有制造过，结果设备、工人都闲着。对于这些工厂来说，加强新产品试制，有计划地扩大产品品种，更是给产品打开销路，充分发挥企业的潜在力量的途径。
    新产品的试制，特别是生产资料的新产品的试制，是有一定困难的。这是因为大部分新产品都是按照苏联先进的设计标准来制造，构造比较复杂，要求的技术比较严格，需要一定数量的具有一定技术水平的工程技术人员来设计和指导试制，需要具有较丰富的技术经验的工人来试制，这是一方面。另一方面，我国原有的工业不发达，制造技术不高，设备不够完善，也造成了新产品制造中的某些困难。但是，为了满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，我们就必须坚决克服这些困难，这些困难也是可以克服的。例如沈阳重型机器厂去年为冶金工业制造每小时破碎八百吨矿石的重型破碎机时，没有适合于翻铸大床身的砂箱，工人出身的技术人员陈富礼就想出“卧地型”的方法来翻铸；没有适合于焖大部件的焖火窑，焖火组工人便自己砌一个大型的焖火窑；没有加工十九吨重的“大架体”的设备，技术人员和工人便研究出用五套专用设备来克服困难。哈尔滨电机厂制造六千瓩水轮发电机和沈阳高压开关厂制造六千瓩水轮机时，大的部件都是靠兄弟厂帮助铸造和加工的。沈阳第一机床厂制造苏联式大型车床时，因工人技术不高，主要部件加工时弯曲不合格，但工人们认真执行苏联专家建议，采取新的方法加工以后不仅克服了困难，并且也提高了工人的技术水平。这些事实说明了：只要依靠工人和工程技术人员的结合，发挥他们的创造性；只要主动地取得兄弟厂的协作；只要认真地贯彻苏联专家的建议和苏联先进经验，就不仅可以克服困难，并且可以通过新产品的制造，逐步提高我国落后的技术水平。
    有些工厂的同志，认为新产品试制麻烦，过分强调试制中的困难，而不主动地积极地克服困难；有的同志脱离实际地强调生产专业化，甚至单一化，以为试制新产品便会妨碍计划管理，便会破坏均衡生产。于是他们就不愿意接受新产品试制的任务。甚至有的工厂的领导干部宁愿让不适合社会需要的或已经供过于求的产品积压着，宁愿让设备、劳动力闲着，而不愿接受试制新产品的任务，即使勉强地接受了，也不认真地去完成。这种思想显然是错误的。为了充分发挥企业的特长及设备能力，以便更大地满足社会需要，实行适当的专业分工是可以的，也是必要的。但是，专业分工也应照顾整体的需要。目前国家建设及人民生活需要上千上万种产品，我们国家不可能为每一种产品建立一个工厂。因此，片面强调产品单一化是不切合实际的。不可否认，产品品种多了，实行计划管理及组织均衡生产就要复杂一些。但是，如果认为增加产品品种便会妨碍计划管理，便会破坏均衡生产，那就是错误的了。许多多产品生产的工厂，如沈阳重型机器厂每年产品有二、三十种之多，不是也同样可以实行计划管理，组织均衡生产吗？
    还有不少的企业领导干部对增加新产品的严重意义认识不足，没有认识到有计划地大量生产新产品以满足国民经济不断增长的需要，乃是现有工业目前一个严重的经济任务和政治任务。他们认为新产品试制计划并不像企业生产计划一样是必须完成的，而是可以完成也可以不完成的。于是，就放松了新产品试制工作的具体领导，放松了检查督促和组织工作。有些工厂把新产品试制任务交给技术科或者少数工程技术人员去负责，而不组织全厂各科室、车间共同配合；在试制过程中，没有材料，没有工具，或者设备不够时，也不给以解决。有些工厂在赶生产任务时就把试制工作排挤了，使新产品的试制处于时断时续的状态，至使新产品试制计划不能按期完成，影响国家建设事业的进行。例如原东北电工十五厂的新产品试制计划没及时完成，就使宁夏电厂不能及时送电和东北某新建工厂不能及时开工生产。负有新产品试制任务的工厂，应记取这个教训，切实地加强对新产品试制工作的领导。新产品试制是涉及全厂各科室、各车间的工作，绝不是哪一个部门或哪一个车间能单独完成的。因此，工厂的领导干部必须把各部门的力量组织起来统一领导，并把新产品试制所需要的材料、工具、设备及劳动力，都编在企业的作业计划内，把新产品试制计划作为企业计划的一部分，把新产品试制计划放在可靠的基础上。
    新产品的制造任务，是要靠职工群众发挥高度的积极性和创造性才能完成的。过去，有些工厂由于没有制订适合于新产品试制的奖励制度，以及又没有对职工讲清新产品试制的政治意义，至使部分职工怕因新产品的技术复杂、生疏，影响工资收入，而不愿担负新产品试制任务。今后，除了制订合理的奖励制度，以保证参加试制的职工的工资收入外，企业里的党组织、工会组织，还必须结合国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传，对职工加强关于制造新产品的政治教育，使职工懂得每一项新产品与国家的社会主义建设及社会主义改造的关系，从而使他们自觉地提高技术，克服困难，为完成新产品制造计划而奋斗！
