    The lofty honor becomes the motivation to continue moving forward.
    Wu Chun'an, recipient of the 1952 Patriotic Bumper Harvest Gold Star Medal
    On February 13th of this year, Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government awarded me the 1952 Patriotic Bumper Harvest Gold Star Medal and personally pinned it on my chest. This is a great happy event that I will never forget.
    The joyous news spread quickly like the wind. When I returned to the village, as soon as I stepped into my house, seventy or eighty people crowded in, the room was packed. They asked this and that, snatching to look at the Gold Star Medal. Everyone's high spirits were truly indescribable. Xu Huaiyi, who is over sixty years old, said, "I've lived this long, but I never thought that us farmers would have this honor. We must work harder in the future." Cheng Hongdi, the captain of the Second Labor Team, Ma Fengying, the health officer, and others also asked me to take the lead in the joint cooperative. Everyone discussed the following specific methods on the spot in order to further increase production and run the agricultural cooperative well:
    This year, the entire cooperative will plant a total of 407 mu of cotton, and the average yield per mu must increase by 129 jin based on last year's 306 jin, reaching 435 jin per mu, with a total yield of more than 177,000 jin, exceeding last year's by more than 45,000 jin. The entire cooperative will plant a total of 1,061 mu of wheat, and the average yield per mu must increase by 35 jin based on the 1953 yield of 149 jin, reaching 184 jin per mu, for a total yield of more than 195,000 jin, exceeding last year's by more than 64,000 jin. Based on this bumper harvest, this year we will sell 50,000 jin of wheat and more than 170,000 jin of cotton to the state to support national industrial construction. In addition, we will help the surrounding agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to jointly improve production. Currently, the four agricultural cooperatives in the township have formed a joint cooperative committee, with me as the chairman. In the future, we must hold joint cooperative committee meetings on time to exchange experiences, solve problems, and continuously consolidate and improve the agricultural production cooperatives. On the other hand, our cooperative's cadres have studied several times and decided that when convening meetings to formulate production plans, arrange livelihood, and study technology, we will absorb the heads of the mutual aid teams to participate, and the cooperative cadres will divide the work to specifically help the nine mutual aid teams, set an example, and drive the entire township to run all fifty-three mutual aid teams well.
    The bumper harvest achievements and this lofty honor achieved by our Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. All our members are very clear about this truth, and everyone unanimously stated that they will continue to move forward under the leadership of the Party in the future.
    Now, this lofty honor has become a driving force for progress. In particular, the female members have demonstrated unprecedented enthusiasm. Vice-Director Xie Qingzhou (female) recently convened a meeting of all female members to discuss and decide to take on all the processing activities after the cotton is sown, and ensure that they manage it well and exceed the planned output. When weeding the wheat fields and applying topdressing fertilizer, 107 female members participated and launched a labor competition. The original plan was to finish weeding in eight days, but they finished it in only five days.

### 崇高的荣誉变成了继续前进的动力

    崇高的荣誉变成了继续前进的动力
    一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章获得者　吴春安
    今年二月十三日，山西省人民政府裴丽生主席给我颁发了一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章，并亲自把它挂在我的胸前。这是我永远忘记不了的一件大喜事。
    可喜的消息像风一样很快地传遍了各地。当我回到村里时，刚一跨进家门，就拥进了七、八十个人，屋里挤得满腾腾的，他们问这问那，夺来夺去地看金星奖章，大家高涨的情绪真是无法形容。六十多岁的徐怀义说：“我活这大年纪，可没想到咱庄稼人还有这一下，今后可更要好好干哩。”第二劳动队队长程洪弟，卫生股长马凤英等并要我抽出时间把联社领导好。大家当场并讨论出以下具体办法，以便进一步提高生产和办好农业社：
    今年全社共种棉花四百零七亩，每亩平均要在去年三百零六斤的基础上增产一百二十九斤，每亩产量达到四百三十五斤，总产量共达十七万七千多斤，超过去年四万五千多斤。全社共种植小麦一千零六十一亩，每亩平均产量要在一九五三年一百四十九斤的基础上提高三十五斤，达到每亩产一百八十四斤，总共可产小麦十九万五千多斤，超过去年六万四千多斤。在这个丰收基础上，今年要卖给国家小麦五万斤、棉花十七万多斤，支援国家工业建设。此外，并要帮助周围农业生产合作社和互助组，共同搞好生产。现全乡四个农业社已组成了联社委员会，由我担任主任委员，今后一定要按时召开联社委员会议，交流经验，解决问题，不断巩固提高农业生产合作社。另一方面，我们社的干部已经研究了几次，决定在召开制订生产计划、安排生活、研究技术等会议时，吸收互助组长参加，社干部并分工具体帮助九个互助组，做出样子，带动全乡把五十三个互助组都办好。
    我们西梁村农业生产合作社所获得的丰产成绩和这一崇高荣誉，是和共产党和毛主席的领导分不开的。这个道理，我们全体社员都很清楚，大家都一致表示今后要在党的领导下继续前进。
    现在，这一崇高的荣誉已经变成了前进的动力，特别是女社员们发挥了从未有过的积极性，副社长解清周（女）不久前召开全体女社员大会，讨论决定把全部棉花下种后的加工活动都包下来，并保证经营好，超过计划产量。在锄麦田和上追肥时，有一百零七个女社员参加，并展开劳动竞赛，原计划八天锄完，结果只用了五天。
