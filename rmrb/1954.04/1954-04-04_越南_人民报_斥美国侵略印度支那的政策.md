    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 2nd: According to Vietnam News Agency on April 1st, the Vietnamese Labor Party's organ, "People's Daily," published an article discussing the United States' policy of aggression in Indochina. The article pointed out that due to the defeats of the French forces in Gia Lam, Cat Bi, and Dien Bien Phu, the ruling groups in the United States and France have shown anxiety. In the current situation in Indochina, US President Eisenhower can no longer conceal the aggressive nature of his policies. Eisenhower recently spoke about the US policy towards Indochina, saying: The real problem lies in defending the United States. But we cannot understand how US intervention in a war of aggression being waged in a country more than 10,000 kilometers from its borders can defend the United States. Eisenhower also held talks with MacArthur, the former American executioner in Korea, to formulate strategies to disrupt the upcoming Geneva Conference and to aggress against Indochina and other Asian countries.
    The Indochina War is the only large-scale war still going on in the world. The American warmongers who live off war do not want to end the Indochina War. They are doing everything possible to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    The article said: The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos yearn for peace, but they are determined to fight for genuine independence and unification. The people of the world are determined to safeguard lasting peace. The American people also condemn the anti-peace conspiracies of the American ruling clique. If the American warmongers continue to refuse to recognize this fact, they will be isolated and are doomed to failure.

    越南“人民报”斥美国侵略印度支那的政策
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社一日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表文章，论述美国在印度支那的侵略政策。文章指出，由于法军在嘉林、吉碑和奠边府遭到了失败，美国和法国统治集团表现得惴惴不安。在印度支那目前的情况下，美国总统艾森豪威尔再也无法隐瞒他的政策的侵略性质。艾森豪威尔最近谈到美国对印度支那的政策时曾经说：真正的问题在于保卫美国。但是我们不能了解，美国干预在离它的国境一万多公里的国家进行的侵略战争又如何能保卫美国。艾森豪威尔还和过去在朝鲜的美国刽子手麦克阿瑟举行会谈，拟订破坏即将举行的日内瓦会议和侵略印度支那以及其他亚洲国家的战略。
    印度支那战争是世界上现在还在进行的唯一的大规模战争。靠战争吃饭的美国战争贩子不希望结束印度支那战争。他们在千方百计地阻挠恢复印度支那的和平。
    文章说：越南、高棉和寮国人民热望和平，但他们是有决心争取真正的独立与统一的。全世界人民有决心维护持久和平。美国人民也斥责美国统治集团的反对和平的阴谋。假使美国战争贩子仍然拒绝承认这个事实的话，他们将陷于孤立，并注定要遭到失败。
