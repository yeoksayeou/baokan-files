    Construction of the Tugen Section of the Greater Khingan Forest Railway
    Construction of the Tu (Lihli) Gen (He) section of the Greater Khingan Forest Railway has begun. This railway is fifty kilometers long, extending north from Lihli River, passing through winding mountains and boundless forests, crossing grasslands and mudflats. The workers undertaking this project successfully completed the railway construction of the Ku (Du'er) Tu (Lihli) section last year. In order to ensure the smooth construction of the Tugen section railway, they began preparations as early as last year. Now, all kinds of tools and most of the materials have been transported to the construction site. More than 800 road workers in the Second Brigade began the foundation engineering on April 3 in advance and launched a labor competition. Other brigades will also begin construction in full swing in early May.

    大兴安岭图根段森林铁路施工
    大兴安岭图（里河）根（河）段森林铁路已开始修建。这条铁路长达五十公里，从图里河往北，要通过曲折的山岭和无边际的森林，越过草丛和泥滩。承担这个工程任务的职工，在去年曾胜利地完成了库（都尔）图（里河）段的铁路修建工程。他们为了使图根段铁路顺利建成，早在去年就开始进行了准备工作。现在，各种工具和大部材料已运到工地。第二大队八百余名路工，已提前在四月三日开始进行奠基工程，并掀起了劳动竞赛。其他各大队也将在五月初全面开始施工。
