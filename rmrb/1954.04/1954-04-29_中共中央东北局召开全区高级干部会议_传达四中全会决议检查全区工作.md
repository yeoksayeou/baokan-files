Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 27th: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a regional meeting of senior Party cadres from March 26th to April 24th to convey the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and to review the work of the Party in the Northeast region. 517 people attended the meeting, and 190 were designated as observers. Comrade Lin Feng, First Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, presided over the first day of the meeting. First, the participants listened to a report from a responsible comrade of the CPC Central Committee regarding the resolutions and spirit of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

The comrades present unanimously supported the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session on behalf of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session.

This meeting was conducted under the close concern and guidance of the CPC Central Committee and was a meeting of unity and education. The meeting fully promoted intra-Party democracy, adhering to the spirit of "say all you know and say it without reserve" and the policy of "being kind to others and curing the sickness to save the patient," and carried out serious criticism and self-criticism in light of the actual conditions in the Northeast region. A total of 42 people, including members of the Northeast Bureau, representatives of various groups, and individuals, spoke at the meeting.

Those who spoke at the meeting unanimously affirmed the achievements made by the Northeast region in recent years under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee. At the same time, they unanimously and seriously criticized a kind of extremely dangerous complacency that is growing in some cadres of the Party in the Northeast region, especially in some senior cadres. Due to this complacency, they are often unwilling to humbly learn from the good experiences of other regions, inappropriately exaggerate their personal roles, do not focus on publicizing the leadership of the Party and the role of the people, and do not seriously study and resolutely implement certain instructions from the Central Committee. Many comrades' speeches sharply criticized the serious mistakes arising from this complacency and individualism, which have hindered unity, hindered work, and hindered progress. In particular, they severely condemned certain intolerable remarks and actions that undermine Party unity. At the same time, the meeting also pointed out that the serious phenomenon of a lack of democratic life, underdeveloped criticism and self-criticism, and Party collective leadership being reduced to a formality within the Northeast Bureau and certain Party organizations must be quickly corrected in accordance with the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session. The meeting emphasized that all individualism, liberalism, decentralism, and sectarianism are hotbeds that allow the Party to be corroded by bourgeois ideology and create convenient conditions for political careerists to engage in activities. To strengthen Party unity, it is necessary to first eliminate these breeding grounds for bacteria.

After more than 20 days of enthusiastic discussion in large and small meetings, combined with the study of documents and self-reflection, the comrades present felt that their thinking had greatly improved and believed that this meeting was the most practical and vivid major Party lesson. They unanimously agreed that the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session are a victory of great historical significance for our country at the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. It is a decisive key for us to lead the whole Party and the people of the whole country from victory to victory. At the same time, they deeply realized the serious significance of the Central Committee's statement that "the unity of the Party is the life of the Party, and any damage to the unity of the Party is assistance and cooperation for the enemy." They further recognized the profound significance of the statement that "as long as there are individualistic and arrogant people within the Party, as long as such people's individualistic sentiments are not resolutely stopped by the Party, they will step by step haggle over positions, compete for power and profit, engage in factionalism, and develop small group activities within the Party, until they embark on the criminal road of helping the enemy to undermine and split the Party." The comrades who attended the meeting all believed that every Communist Party member must always abide by Comrade Mao Zedong's constant instructions of "humility and prudence" and "avoid arrogance and rashness" to prevent the danger of a Communist Party member degenerating from the noble qualities of wholeheartedly and diligently serving the people to the despicable individualistic quagmire of the bourgeoisie.

In his concluding speech, Comrade Lin Feng called on all Party comrades in the Northeast to earnestly strengthen unity, strengthen Party spirit training, improve political vigilance, be vigilant against various conspiracies and sabotage by class enemies, thoroughly eliminate all bourgeois ideological influences that are detrimental to Party unity, loyally unite around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, implement the spirit of the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session into the life and practical work of the Party, and make a hundredfold effort to do a good job, especially to do a good job in completing the glorious tasks of national construction given to our Northeast region by the Central Committee. He repeatedly emphasized that it is necessary to earnestly do what the Central Committee teaches: "The interests of Party unity are above all else, therefore, the maintenance and consolidation of Party unity should be taken as the standard guiding one's words and actions." We must use this standard to earnestly examine our own thoughts and work in order to achieve the goal of strengthening Party unity.

The meeting finally adopted the important document "Resolution of the Northeast Region Party Senior Cadres Meeting on Safeguarding the Resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session." It put forward corresponding positive suggestions and effective measures to strengthen Party unity and improve Party collective leadership. The resolution stipulates that every senior Party cadre must strictly abide by the Party's democratic centralism and strictly abide by the principle of Party collective leadership. Party organizations at all levels and agencies at all levels should earnestly and fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, and oppose any bad phenomena that suppress democracy and violate Party principles. Any cadre within the Party must, without exception, be subject to the supervision of the Party organization and the people. Party discipline and state laws must be absolutely observed and enforced. The resolution calls on: In order to resolutely implement the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, it is necessary to organize the whole Party to deeply study the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" and related documents in light of reality, and further strengthen Marxist-Leninist education, strengthen the Party's ideological and organizational work, strengthen the combat effectiveness of Party organizations, strengthen the Party's ties with the masses, and rapidly improve the Party's work, and forge ahead courageously to gradually realize the Party's general line in the transition period.

    中共中央东北局召开全区高级干部会议
    传达四中全会决议检查全区工作
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】中共中央东北局在三月二十六日至四月二十四日召开了全区党的高级干部会议，传达了中共七届四中全会的决议，并检查了东北地区党的工作。出席会议的有五百一十七人，指定列席的一百九十人。会议第一天由东北局第一副书记林枫同志主持。首先听取了中共中央负责同志关于党的七届四中全会决议和精神的传达报告。
      到会同志一致地拥护刘少奇同志受中共中央政治局和毛泽东同志委托在七届四中全会上所作的报告，和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”。
    这次会议是在中共中央密切关怀和指导下进行的，是一次团结教育的大会。会议充分发扬了党内民主，本“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神和“与人为善，治病救人”的方针，结合东北地区实际情况，展开了严肃的批评与自我批评。东北局委员、各代表小组、及个人发言者共四十二人。
    会上发言者一致肯定了几年来东北地区在党中央的正确领导下所取得的成绩。同时，一致严肃地批判了在东北地区党的一些干部中，特别是在一些高级干部中，正在滋长起来的一种极端危险的骄傲自满情绪。由于有了这种骄傲自满情绪，就往往不愿意虚心学习其他地区好的经验，不适当地夸大个人的作用，不着重宣传党的领导和人民群众的作用，不认真钻研和坚决贯彻中央的某些指示。会上许多同志的发言尖锐地批评了由于这种骄傲自满情绪和个人主义而产生的一些妨害团结、妨害工作、妨害进步的严重错误。特别是严厉地斥责了某些破坏党的团结的不可容忍的言论和行动。同时，会议也指出：东北局及某些党的组织内，缺乏民主生活、批评与自我批评很不开展、党的集体领导流于形式的严重现象，必须根据党的七届四中全会的决议迅速加以纠正。会议着重指出：一切个人主义、自由主义、分散主义、宗派主义都是使党遭受资产阶级思想腐蚀的温床，给政治野心家造成便利的活动条件，要加强党的团结必须首先消灭这些繁殖细菌的温床。
      经过二十多天的大会小会热烈讨论，并结合文件学习反省，到会同志均感到在思想上大大地提高了一步，并认为这次会议是最实际、最生动的一次大的党课。一致认为党的七届四中全会决议是我们国家处在社会主义革命即社会主义改造阶段中具有重大历史意义的胜利。它是我们把全党和全国人民从胜利引向胜利的一个决定性的关键。同时，深刻认识到中央所指出“党的团结就是党的生命，对于党的团结的任何损害，就是对于敌人的援助和合作。”的严重意义。并进一步认识到“只要党内出现了个人主义的骄傲的人们，只要这种人的个人主义情绪不受到党的坚决的制止，他们就会一步一步地在党内计较地位，争权夺利，拉拉扯扯，发展小集团的活动，直至走上帮助敌人来破坏党分裂党的罪恶道路”的深刻意义。与会同志都认为每个共产党员必须时刻遵守毛泽东同志所经常教导的“谦虚谨慎”、“戒骄戒躁”的指示，防止一个共产党员由满腔热忱地勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的高贵品质堕落到资产阶级的卑鄙的个人主义泥坑里去的危险。
      林枫同志在总结发言中，号召东北全党同志认真加强团结，加强党性锻炼，提高政治警惕性，警惕阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏，彻底肃清一切不利于党的团结的资产阶级思想影响，忠诚地团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的周围，把党的七届四中全会决议的精神贯彻到党的生活中和实际工作中去，百倍努力地做好工作，特别要很好地完成中央所给予我们东北地区的国家建设的光荣任务。他反复强调指出要切实做到中央所教导的：“党的团结的利益高于一切，因此应当把维护和巩固党的团结作为指导自己言论和行动的标准。”要以这个标准切实地来检查自己的思想和工作，达到增强党的团结的目的。
    会议最后通过了“东北地区党的高级干部会议关于维护党的七届四中全会决议的决议”的重要文件。提出了相应的加强党的团结和改进党的集体领导的积极建议和有效措施。决议规定：每个党的高级干部必须严格遵守党的民主集中制，严格遵守党的集体领导的原则。各级党的组织及各级机关均应认真地充分发扬民主，开展自下而上的批评与自我批评，反对任何压制民主的违反党的原则的恶劣现象。党内任何干部必须毫无例外地受到党的组织和人民群众的监督。党纪国法必须绝对遵守和执行。决议号召：为了坚决贯彻党的七届四中全会决议，必须组织全党结合实际，深入学习“关于增强党的团结的决议”和有关文件，并进一步加强马克思、列宁主义的教育，加强党的思想工作和组织工作，加强党的组织的战斗性，加强党与人民群众的联系，把党的工作迅速提高一步，为逐步实现党在过渡时期的总路线而奋勇前进。
