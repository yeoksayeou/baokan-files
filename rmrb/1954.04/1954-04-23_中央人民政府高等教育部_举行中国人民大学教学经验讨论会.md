    Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government
    Holds Teaching Experience Discussion Conference at Renmin University of China
    The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government held a teaching experience discussion conference at Renmin University of China from April 12th to 21st. The conference was held in conjunction with the National Higher Finance and Economics Education Conference. More than 500 people attended the meeting, including presidents and teaching leaders from various types of universities across the country.
    During the conference, Hu Xikui and Zou Lufeng, vice presidents of Renmin University of China, gave experience reports on "Learning from the Soviet Union and Combining with China's Actual Situation," "Experience in Training Worker-Peasant Cadres," and six system-specific reports on the work of the Academic Affairs Department, the leadership work of the departments, the work of the teaching and research sections, and scientific research. The conference also organized representatives to visit the general exhibition hall of Renmin University of China, the Academic Affairs Department, various departments, and teaching and research sections for multiple visits and discussions to further understand the specific situation of the school's teaching in various aspects. The representatives unanimously reflected that this conference systematically reflected the experiences and achievements of Renmin University of China in learning from the Soviet Union in various aspects.
    The conference believes that the achievements of Renmin University of China in vigorously implementing the educational policy of combining teaching with practice and combining Soviet experience with China's actual situation, as stipulated by the Central Government, have universal and practical guiding significance for universities and colleges across the country. The conference summarized the characteristics of Renmin University of China as: (1) Renmin University of China attaches special importance to Marxist-Leninist ideological education, not only giving political theory courses an important position in the teaching plan, but also taking Marxism-Leninism as the foundation of all courses; all other work is also carried out under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought. (2) From the beginning, Renmin University of China has attached great importance to training worker-peasant cadres to become the backbone of the national construction cause, establishing preparatory courses, strengthening the leadership of worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and taking into account the learning characteristics of worker-peasant students in many aspects such as teaching plans and teaching methods. (3) The courses of Renmin University of China, from political theory to finance and economics and political science and law professional textbooks, some are directly taken from Soviet experience, and some are compiled by themselves, which can not only be used for reference by various universities and colleges, but also, universities and colleges can study and use these teaching materials to learn and apply the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to connect with China's actual situation to solve the problem of compiling their own teaching materials. (4) Renmin University of China is oriented towards teaching in all aspects of organization, leadership methods, and work deployment, with teaching as the center and serving teaching. The school's teaching shows strong organization and discipline. In the three years up to 1953, the student attendance rate was 99.72%. Observing labor discipline has become a habit for all teachers and students. (5) Renmin University of China vigorously organizes scientific research work to improve the level of teachers and the quality of teaching. Most of the teachers at Renmin University of China are trained in a short period of time and have heavy teaching tasks. This work can be carried out mainly because the direction is clear and the leadership is firm. (6) Renmin University of China seizes the teaching and research section as the central link in running the school well, through which to carry out teaching, conduct scientific research, train teachers, and improve teachers' political and ideological level. The conference pointed out that the above is the result of Renmin University of China's conscientious study of the Soviet Union, which proves that the school-running spirit and various systems and methods of Soviet universities are all models for us to learn from.
    Before the closing of the conference, President Wu Yuzhang spoke. He elaborated in detail on the important significance of running finance and economics colleges well for the realization of the Party's general line during the transition period, and hoped that everyone would embrace the revolutionary spirit of overcoming difficulties and continue to move forward. Regarding teaching in finance and economics colleges, he emphasized that systematic Marxist-Leninist education should be further strengthened and Soviet experience should be learned. He particularly pointed out that strengthening the Party's leadership and strengthening the unity between Party members and non-Party members are the guarantees for completing teaching tasks.
    At the closing meeting on the 21st, Yang Xiufeng, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, pointed out that the experience of Renmin University of China in learning from the Soviet Union is applicable to other universities and colleges. The view that Renmin University of China has special conditions and that its experience is good but cannot be learned from is incorrect; on the other hand, it is also inappropriate to apply it rigidly without considering the specific conditions. He asked all universities and colleges to adopt it in a planned and step-by-step manner according to their specific conditions, and gradually achieve comprehensive and systematic learning. He said: Renmin University of China's experience in learning from the Soviet Union is a process of constantly overcoming difficulties and creating conditions. The key to its leadership experience lies in resolutely implementing the Central Government's policies, having the correct direction, steady steps, actively overcoming difficulties, and resolutely moving forward.

    中央人民政府高等教育部
    举行中国人民大学教学经验讨论会
    中央人民政府高等教育部在四月十二日到二十一日举行中国人民大学教学经验讨论会，会议是结合全国高等财经教育会议进行的。参加会议的有全国各类高等学校校长和教学领导干部等五百多人。
    会议期间，中国人民大学副校长胡锡奎、邹鲁风等，分别作了“关于学习苏联与中国实际相结合的经验”、“关于培养工农干部的经验”以及关于教务部工作、系的领导工作、教研室工作、科学研究工作等六个系统的经验报告。会议并组织代表们到中国人民大学总展览室、教务部、各系和教研室进行了多次参观和座谈，进一步了解了该校教学上各方面的具体情况。与会代表一致反映这次大会较系统地反映了中国人民大学各方面学习苏联的经验和成就。
    会议认为：中国人民大学大力贯彻中央规定的教学与实际联系、苏联经验与中国情况相结合的教育方针所取得的成就，对全国各高等院校有普遍的、现实的指导意义。会议总结出中国人民大学的特点是：（一）中国人民大学特别重视马克思列宁主义的思想教育，不仅在教学计划中给予政治理论课以重要位置，一切课程都以马克思列宁主义为基础；其他一切工作也都是在马克思列宁主义思想指导下进行的。（二）中国人民大学从开始就很重视培养工农干部成为国家建设事业中的骨干，创办预科，加强工农速成中学的领导，以及在教学计划、教学方法等多方面都照顾到工农学生学习的特点。（三）中国人民大学的各门课程，从政治理论到财经、政法各专业教材，有的是直接取自苏联经验，有的是自己编写，不仅可供各高等学校参考应用，同时，各高等学校还可以在研究和使用这些教材中，学习应用马克思列宁主义的方法联系中国实际的精神，来解决自己教材的编写问题。（四）中国人民大学在组织上、领导方法上、工作布置上各方面都面向教学，一切以教学为中心，为教学服务。该校教学中显示了坚强的组织性和纪律性，截至一九五三年的三年中，学生到课率为百分之九十九点七二。遵守劳动纪律已成为全体师生的习惯。（五）中国人民大学大力组织科学研究工作，借以提高教师水平和教学质量。中国人民大学的教师多是短期培养出来的且教学任务繁重，这一工作得以展开，主要是由于方向明确，领导坚定。（六）中国人民大学抓住教研室作为办好学校的中心环节，通过它来进行教学，开展科学研究，培养师资，提高教师的政治思想水平。会议指出，以上是中国人民大学认真学习苏联的结果，它证明了苏联的高等学校的办学精神和各项制度、办法，都是我们学习的榜样。
    会议闭幕前，吴玉章校长讲话。他详细阐述了办好财经院校对实现党在过渡时期总路线的重要意义，并希望大家抱定克服困难的革命精神，不断前进。对于财经院校教学上，他强调应进一步加强系统的马克思列宁主义的教育，学习苏联经验。他特别提出：加强党的领导，加强党与非党的团结，是完成教学任务的保证。
  在二十一日的闭幕会上，中央人民政府高等教育部副部长杨秀峰指出，中国人民大学学习苏联的经验，对其他高等学校都是适用的。认为中国人民大学条件特殊、经验虽好、但不能学习的看法是不对的；另一方面，不根据具体条件硬搬去应用也不妥当。他要求各院校根据具体情况有计划地有步骤地采用，逐步达到全面地、系统地学习。他说：中国人民大学学习苏联的经验，是不断克服困难创造条件的过程，它的领导经验的关键，在于坚决贯彻中央的方针，方向正确，步骤稳当，积极克服困难，坚决前进。  （新华社）
