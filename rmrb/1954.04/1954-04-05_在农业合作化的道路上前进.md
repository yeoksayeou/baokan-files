    Our Situation Gets Better Year by Year
    Letter from Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda: Chairman Mao instructed that organizing is the "inevitable path for peasants to transform from poverty to prosperity." The peasants of our Xigou Village have been on this path for over ten years, creating today's happy life.
    In 1943, we were allocated land and, in response to Chairman Mao's call, established mutual aid teams. We actively produced on our own land, cultivated meticulously, expanded the land area, improved the land quality, and thus increased production. By 1950, the village's average grain yield was 345 jin per mu. With economic development and improved production conditions, mutual aid teams could no longer meet the needs of further production development, so in the winter of 1951, we established an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative. Although production decreased due to disaster in 1953, the cooperative still averaged 351.5 jin of grain per mu (the best mutual aid team in the neighboring village averaged only 290+ jin per mu, and individual households averaged only 230+ jin per mu).
    As production increased, the income of cooperative members increased, and their lives gradually became prosperous. Take village head Wang Zhouliu, for example; he used to live in a house made of corn stalks and wore ragged clothes year-round. Now, he has more than enough to eat and live in four large stone cave dwellings, wearing nice clothes regularly. There are too many such examples.
    Now our Xigou Village has been designated as Xigou Township, including the three natural villages of Nansai, Chidi, and Xigou, with a total of 276 households in the township. In January of this year, our agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative expanded to about 200 households, accounting for more than 70% of the township's total farm households. Although the expansion of the cooperative has brought us many new problems, we are confident in overcoming the difficulties, running the cooperative well, and fully utilizing its advantages. We guarantee: in agriculture, we will achieve deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, apply more fertilizer, and eliminate missing seedlings; plant according to local conditions, appropriately densely plant, promote fine varieties, and ensure an increase of 50 jin of raw grain per mu, producing a total of more than 540,000 jin of grain for the cooperative. In forestry, we will plant more than 10,000 public fruit trees and timber trees, and afforest 500 mu. In animal husbandry, we will breed 300 lambs, 40 young livestock, and increase the number of pigs by 60. In sideline production, we will rationally use surplus labor, and in addition to carrying out basic land construction, we will also send 23 carpenters, blacksmiths, stonemasons, and plasterers to participate in national basic construction, which can earn 75 million yuan (approximately 20% of agricultural income). Under the condition of comprehensively increasing income, we plan to sell 70,000 jin of surplus grain in 1954 to support national industrial construction.
    We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and continuing to move forward on the road of cooperativization, our lives will get better year by year. We will work actively to strive for the early realization of a happy socialist society.

    Poor Ravine Becomes Rich Ravine
    Letter from Zhang Guichen, Director of the Agricultural Production Cooperative of Tabeiyingzi Village, Eighth District, Kazuo Banner, Rehe Province (written by Jin Guochen on his behalf): Our village is located in a mountain ravine and is one of the famous "Four Poor Ravines" in the banner. In the past, everyone said that no matter how hard you tried in a poor ravine, you couldn't have a good life. However, in 1952, our eight households organized an agricultural production cooperative, and our situation has been getting better day by day. At the beginning, only my family had enough to eat among the eight households, and my old donkey was the only animal power in the entire cooperative. Some people said that we would starve and fall apart. But our eight households united as one, worked hard, and with the support of the government, we achieved a bumper harvest that autumn, with the entire cooperative harvesting 57 shi of grain and picking 3,100 jin of cotton. The lives of the cooperative members immediately improved, and even the most difficult Zhang Guiyu family (with six people) no longer worried about food and clothing. The cooperative members not only managed their own production well but also tried their best to help farmers outside the cooperative. As a result, more people wanted to join the cooperative, and in 1953, our cooperative expanded to 35 households.
    These 35 households live in three natural villages, four and a half li apart; the entire cooperative's 614 mu of land is located on mountain slopes 12 li away. With so many households, living so dispersedly, and the land so fragmented, it was difficult to lead. Therefore, we implemented a system of long-term contracting of land, organizing three agricultural teams and one cotton field team (including sideline occupations) according to the amount of labor and the distance of the land, appropriately allocating agricultural tools, manure, and seeds, and determining the annual output of the land, implementing a system of rewarding overproduction and compensating for unwarranted production reductions. This greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. We also studied the soil properties of all the fields in the cooperative and applied the necessary fertilizers separately. When leaving seedlings, we also implemented appropriate dense planting according to soil quality and fertilization. After the autumn harvest, calculations showed that the entire cooperative had a total income of 179,400 jin of raw grain. In the past, everyone didn't have enough to eat; last year, the entire cooperative sold a full 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Our livestock is no longer just an old donkey but three horses, one mule, nine cows, six donkeys, and 202 sheep. Where did these achievements come from? This is because the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us onto the road of organization, and because of the support of the state and the supply of new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers by the working-class elder brothers.
    After studying the general line, the farmers near our cooperative saw the socialist prospects clearly and saw that our cooperative was harvesting more grain year by year, and more and more people wanted to join the cooperative. The more than 100 farmers in our "Four Poor Ravines" have decided to organize together to form a large cooperative. This year, the entire cooperative will plant 150 mu of cotton, striving to pick 350 jin of seed cotton per mu; 1,550 mu of large fields are planned to produce 340 jin of grain per mu.
    This place, which people used to call a "poor ravine," has established a cooperative in the past two years, and the income of the farmers is no less than that of the farmers in the nearby plains. Now we have also made a five-year plan for raising livestock, planting fruit trees, and raising bees. When the plan is realized, the lives of each of our cooperative members will be greatly improved. Let everyone see! As long as agriculture is cooperativized, "a poor ravine can become a rich ravine!"

    Realized a Thirty-Year Wish
    Letter from reader Wang Zhen: There are over a thousand mu of flat land in Hebei Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, adjacent to a mountain gully. The floods flowing down from the mountain were wasted because there was no irrigation canal, and the crops were often threatened by drought. Thirty years ago, someone proposed building a canal. But in the old society, farmers couldn't even afford to eat and clothe themselves, so where would they get the strength to build a canal! A few years ago, the village organized mutual aid teams, and the members talked about this matter again. But everyone was afraid that building a canal would delay work and occupy their own land, so it didn't happen.
    In January of this year, the mutual aid team led by Jia Shuangqing developed into an agricultural production cooperative of 36 households. The cooperative members discussed it together and felt that the reason they couldn't build a canal in the past was because individual households were scattered and couldn't unite; now that the cooperative has unified leadership and collective land management, building a canal can definitely be done. They calculated the details: after the canal is built, at least 400 mu of land can be irrigated with mountain water; irrigating each mu twice can increase production by at least 30 jin of grain, and 400 mu of land can increase production by 12,000 jin of grain a year. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. From January 24th to 26th, all the cooperative members spent three days building a canal more than two li long. The masses outside the cooperative unanimously reflected: the agricultural cooperative has great power! Things that couldn't be done for more than thirty years were done as soon as the agricultural cooperative was established.

    All Three Members of the Family Have Suitable Jobs
    Letter from Zhao Fengcheng of Xiaojiaohe Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province (written by Wang Engui on his behalf): I am fifty-eight years old this year and am the feeder of the agricultural cooperative in our village. Last spring, I listened to my son and daughter-in-law and signed up to join the agricultural production cooperative. In order to take care of our poor household, the cooperative lent me three shi of grain and 300,000 yuan, which enabled me to pay off my old debts and solve the problem of food for the whole family. I was so happy to receive such help as soon as I joined the cooperative. The director of the cooperative saw that I was old and let me be the livestock feeder, entrusting me with the feeding of the cooperative's ten horses and two cows. At first, everyone was worried that I wouldn't be able to feed them well; but I fed them carefully, and the livestock were well-fed. I was able to raise my work points from six to eight points a day. Sometimes I can also spare time to go to the field to do half a day's work. My son can drive a cart, so the cooperative let him drive a cart. Because my daughter-in-law is pregnant, she was asked to thin the seedlings in the dry land when planting rice. In this way, all three of us adults have work to do.
    After joining the agricultural production cooperative, the situation is very different. Last year, our family of three did a total of 440 workdays, earning 94 shi of grain, which is several times more than my income before joining the cooperative. Now I am determined to take the road of cooperativization. I absolutely cannot spend the money that my family received indiscriminately! First, I will pay off the horse loan from the bank, then buy some clothes, and put all the rest into the supply and marketing cooperative so that the strength of the cooperative will be even greater.

    Even Semi-Disabled People Can Play Their Specialties in Production
    Letter from Wu Gui, a farmer in Chenjiazhuang, Datong County, Shanxi Province (written by Li Tingxuan on his behalf): I have a leg pain disability, and coupled with being weak, I cannot do the heavy work in the fields. Although I was allocated land during the land reform, I had to hire people every year for heavy work such as sending manure, grabbing manure, harvesting, and threshing, and it was still not enough for my family of five to eat.
    In 1952, I joined the mutual aid team. The team exchanged work, and that year I no longer hired workers. I did 170 workdays and earned seven or eight shi more than when I worked alone, and the family's life also improved.
    That winter, I joined the Zhao Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the village. The cooperative knew that I could cultivate the land and assigned me to cultivate the land in the third production team. During the year, I earned 104 workdays just by cultivating the land. In winter, I specialized in grass collection work. In this way, I did 391 workdays throughout the year, with a net income of 47 shi and 8 dou, almost double what I earned in the mutual aid team.
    The facts of the past year have made me deeply feel that the agricultural cooperative is my home; without the agricultural cooperative, I, a semi-disabled person, would not be able to live a good life. So I wholeheartedly work hard for the cooperative. After studying the general line, I sold more than three shi of surplus grain to the state, and I also plan to use the money from selling grain to buy two piglets and one sheep to accumulate more manure for the cooperative. I also plan to buy a cow together with others and put it into the cooperative so that the cooperative can produce better this year.

    Let the Mothers of the Children Work Peacefully in the Fields
    Letter from Wen Renchen, a member of the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Houjia Village, Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province (written by Ding Huaide, Wang Dingming, and five others on his behalf): I am sixty-eight years old this year and am a widowed old woman. This year, I joined the agricultural cooperative, and I am really happy in my heart. Thinking back to my past bitter days, it is really sad. I have no children and no labor force. Although I have a few mu of land, I have no way to take care of it. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries often conscripted soldiers and recruited laborers, and the young men in the village all hid. I had no way to find someone to help me, and the farmland was often covered with grass. In order to live, I had to weed and harvest wheat myself, and often sweat and tears flowed together into the ground. I remember one summer when I was harvesting wheat, I was so tired that my back hurt and my legs ached, and I fainted on the ground. At that time, who would care about my life or death? After liberation, the People's Government took care of me and helped me in various ways, and I finally had a bowl of rice to eat; but because there was no one in the family, production was not good, and life was still difficult. In June last year, the Hou Dongzhi mutual aid team in the village organized a baby-holding team. They saw that I had difficulty farming and asked me to hold babies in their team. They did the work in the fields for me, and everyone rated according to the rules of the team. In this way, my income increased. I was so touched that I didn't know what to say, so I wholeheartedly took good care of the children. I deeply felt that the mutual aid team was good, and working alone was a root of poverty. This time, when the village established an agricultural production cooperative, I boldly asked to join the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, I was busy at home for two or three days and didn't go to the fields to see; when I went to the fields to see, the wheat seedlings were watered with manure. At that time, I laughed and came back. From then on, I realized more clearly that this was the right path pointed out by Chairman Mao. At the meeting to join the cooperative, I expressed my feelings to everyone, that I would be more patient in taking care of the cooperative's babies and let the mothers of the children work peacefully in the fields; and I would also spare time to go to the fields to do some light work. This is also my little effort as an old woman to thank Chairman Mao for his care.

    在农业合作化的道路上前进
    我们的光景一年比一年好
    农业劳动模范李顺达来信：毛主席指示，组织起来是农民“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。我们西沟村的农民在这条道路上走了十来年，创造了今天的幸福生活。
    一九四三年，我们分得了土地，并响应毛主席的号召，成立了互助组。我们在自己土地上积极生产，精耕细作，扩大了土地面积，提高了土地质量，产量就提高了。到一九五○年，全村每亩地平均产粮三百四十五斤。随着经济的发展和生产条件的改善，互助组已不能满足进一步发展生产的要求，于是就在一九五一年冬季成立了农林畜牧生产合作社。一九五三年虽则因灾减产，全社每亩还平均产粮三百五十一斤半（邻村最好的互助组每亩平均只产二百九十余斤，单干户平均每亩只产二百三十多斤）。
    生产提高了，社员的收入增加了，生活就逐渐富裕了。拿村长王周刘来说，原来把玉茭秆子围起来顶屋住，常年穿的是破烂衣裳；现在达到耕一余一，住着四所大石窑，平常穿着好衣服。这样的例子太多了。
    现在我们西沟村已划为西沟乡了，包括南赛、池底、西沟三个自然村，全乡共有二百七十六户。今年一月份我们的农林畜牧生产合作社扩大到二百户左右，占全乡总农户的百分之七十以上。虽然合作社的扩大给我们带来了许多新的问题，但我们有信心克服困难，把合作社办好，充分发挥它的优越性。我们保证：在农业方面，要做到深耕细作，多上肥料，消灭缺苗断垅；因地种植，适当密植，推广优良品种，保证每亩增产五十斤原粮，全社共生产五十四万多斤粮食。在林业方面，要植公有果树和木材树一万多株，造林五百亩。在畜牧方面，要繁殖小羊三百只，繁殖小牲口四十头，增加猪六十口。在副业生产方面，要合理使用剩余劳力，除进行土地基本建设外，还抽出二十三个木工、铁工、石工、泥水工参加国家基本建设，可以得工资七千五百万元（约占农业收入的百分之二十）。在全面增加收入的条件下，我们准备在一九五四年出卖余粮七万斤，来支援国家工业建设。
    我们相信，在党和人民政府的领导下，在合作化的道路上继续前进，我们的光景一年会比一年好过。我们要积极努力，争取幸福的社会主义社会早日实现。
    穷沟变富沟
    热河省喀左旗八区塔贝营子村农业生产合作社主任张桂臣来信（靳国宸代笔）：我们村在山沟沟里，是旗里有名的“四大穷沟”之一。过去大家都说，穷沟里怎样闹也闹不出好生活来。可是，一九五二年我们八户组织了一个农业生产合作社，光景就一天一天好起来。开始时，我们八户里只是我一家够吃，我的一头老驴就是全社唯一的畜力。有些人说，我们饿也得饿散。但我们八户团结一致，使劲干活，再加上政府的扶持，当年秋季就得到丰收，全社打了五十七石粮，摘了三千一百斤棉花。社员们的生活马上改善了，最困难的张桂余家（有六口人）也不再愁吃愁穿了。社员们不但搞好自己的生产，还尽量帮助社外农户。这样一来，要求入社的人就多了，一九五三年，我们社扩大到三十五户。
    这三十五户人家分居在三个自然屯里，相离有四里半地；全社六百一十四亩地，座落在方圆十二里远的山坡上。户数这样多，住的挺分散，土地又零碎，领导起来很困难。于是，我们就实行了土地常年大包工的办法，按劳力多少，土地远近，组织了三个农业队、一个棉田队（包括副业），把农具、粪肥、种籽都作了适当的分配，定出土地的常年产量，实行超产奖励、无故减产包赔的制度。这就大大提高了社员的生产积极性。我们又研究了全社田地的土壤性质，分别施上需要的肥料。留苗时，又按土质和上粪情况实行适当密植。秋收后一计算，全社共收入十七万九千四百斤原粮。过去大伙不够吃，去年全社卖给国家整整一万斤余粮。我们的牲口已经不单是一头老驴，而是三匹马、一头骡子、九条牛、六头驴和二百零两只羊。这些成绩是从哪儿得来的呢？这是因为共产党、毛主席领着我们走上了组织起来的道路，是因为有了国家的支持和工人老大哥供给我们新农具、化学肥料。
    学习了总路线以后，我社附近的农民看清了社会主义的远景，又见到我们社一年比一年多打粮，要求入社的人越来越多了。我们“四大穷沟”的一百多户农民已决定组织到一块，搞一个大社。全社今年种一百五十亩棉花，争取每亩摘三百五十斤籽棉；一千五百五十亩大田，计划每亩产三百四十斤粮食。
    我们这个过去人称为“穷沟”的地方，这二年搞了合作社，农民收入已不比附近平川地农民少。现在我们又作了一个养牲畜、栽果树、养蜜蜂的五年计划。到计划实现时，我们每个社员的生活更将大大改善。让大家看看吧！只要农业合作化了，“穷沟就能变富沟”！
    实现了三十年来的愿望
    读者王臻来信：山西省平顺县河北村有一千多亩川地紧靠着一条山沟。山上流下来的洪水，因为没有灌溉渠而白白流走了，庄稼就时常受到旱灾的威胁。三十年以前，就有人提议修渠。但在旧社会，农民家家户户吃穿都顾不上，那有力量来修渠呢！前几年村里组织了互助组，组员们又谈论起这件事。可是大家都怕修渠误工和占用自己地，因此也就没有搞成。
    今年一月份，贾双庆领导的互助组发展为一个三十六户的农业生产合作社。社员们在一块商量了一下，都觉得过去修不起渠来，是因为一家一户分散经营，合不在一起；现在社里统一领导，集体经营土地，修渠的事一定能办起来。他们算了一下细账：修成渠以后，至少有四百亩土地可浇上山水；一亩浇上两次，最低可增产三十斤粮食，四百亩地一年就可增产一万二千斤粮食。这大大鼓舞了社员们的热情。一月二十四日到二十六日，全体社员用了三天工夫修成了一条二里多长的渠。社外群众一致反映：农业社力量就是大！三十多年办不成的事情，农业社刚成立就办成了。
    爷儿三个都有了合适的工作
    吉林省蛟河县小蛟河村赵凤城来信（王恩贵代笔）：我今年五十八岁啦，是我们村上农业社的饲养员。去年春天，我听了儿子和儿媳妇的话报名参加了农业生产合作社。社里为了照顾我们贫困户，借给我三石粮食和三十万元，使我还去了陈账，又解决了全家的吃粮问题。我刚一入社就得到这样的帮助，真是越想越乐。社主任看我岁数大了，让我当牲畜饲养员，把全社的十匹马二头牛交给我喂养。开始大伙怕我喂养不过来；可是我经心在意地喂养，牲畜饲养的挺胖，记的工也从每天六分增加到八分。有时我还能抽空下地干半天活。我儿子能赶车，社里就让他赶车。儿媳妇因为怀小孩，在栽稻子时就叫她在旱田间苗。这一来俺们三口大人都有活计干。
    参加了农业生产合作社后，光景就大不同了，去年俺爷儿三个一共做了四百四十个劳动日，收入九十四石粮食，等于我入社前收入的好几倍。这下我可认准走合作化这条道了。我家分得的这些钱，我绝对不能胡花！先把银行贷的马钱还了，再添置点穿的，剩下的全部入到供销合作社里去，好使合作社的力量更大。
    半残废人在生产中也发挥了专长
    山西大同县陈家庄农民吴贵来信（李廷选代笔）：我有腿痛的残疾，再加上体弱力衰，做不了地里的笨重营生。土地改革时我虽然分到了土地，但年年送粪、抓粪、收割、打场等重活都得请人，一家五口吃用还是不够。
    一九五二年我参加了互助组。组里换工干活，那年我就没再雇工，自己作了一百七十个工，收入比单干多了七、八石，全家生活也改善了。
    当年冬天，我参加了庄上赵喜顺农业生产合作社。社里知道我能耕地，分配我到生产第三大队去耕地。一年中，光耕地我就挣了一百零四个劳动日。冬季我专作入草工作。这样，全年就作了三百九十一个劳动日，纯收入四十七石八斗，比在互助组时几乎多了一倍。
    一年来的事实，使我深深感到农业社就是我的家；没有农业社，我这半残废人就不能过好时光。所以我一心一意给社里好好做活。学习了总路线以后，我把三石余粮卖给了国家，还计划把卖粮的钱买两只小猪、一只羊，多给社里攒点粪，另外和别人伙买一头牛入到社里，让今年社里生产搞得更好。
    让孩子们的妈妈安心来做庄稼活
    陕西洋县侯家村黎明农业生产合作社社员文仁晨来信（丁怀德、王鼎铭等五人代笔）：我今年六十八岁了，是个孤寡老婆子。年上我加入了农业合作社，心里真高兴。回想起我过去的苦日子来，实在心酸。我没儿没女一个人，没有劳动力，自己虽有几亩地，也没法侍弄。那时国民党反动派经常拉兵要夫，村里年青小伙子都躲走了，我想找人帮忙也没办法，庄稼地里经常盖满了草。为了要生活，我只得自己去锄草、割麦，常常汗水和眼泪一齐往地里流。记得有一年夏天割麦子，我累得腰痛腿酸，昏倒在地上了。那时有谁来管我的死活呢？解放以后，人民政府从各方面来照顾我、帮助我，我总算有碗饭吃了；可是因为家里没有人手，生产搞不好，生活还是感到困难。去年六月间，村里侯东之互助组组织了抱娃娃组。他们看我做庄稼很困难，叫我在他们组里抱娃娃，他们给我干地里活，大家都按组里的规矩评分。这样，我的收入就增加了。我感动得不知说什么好，就尽心尽意地把小孩照管好。我深深地感到互助组就是好，单干到底是个穷根子。这次村里建立农业生产合作社，我大着胆子要求参加了社。入社以后，有两三天我在家里忙着没到地里去看；等我到地里去看时，满地的麦苗都浇上了水粪。当时我就笑回来了。从此，我更清楚地认识到这都是毛主席指的道正。在入社大会上，我向大伙表示了心意，要更耐心地把社里娃娃经管好，让孩子们的妈妈安下心来做庄稼；并且还要抽空到地里干些轻活。这也算是我这个老婆子答谢毛主席关怀的一点心意吧。
