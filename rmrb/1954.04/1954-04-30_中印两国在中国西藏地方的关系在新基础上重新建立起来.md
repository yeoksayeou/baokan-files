    The negotiations between the Chinese government delegation and the Indian government delegation in Beijing regarding the issue of relations between China and India in China's Tibet region have successfully ended. On April 29th, the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India" was signed, and notes were exchanged. The existing situation of Sino-Indian relations in China's Tibet region is a trace left over from the British aggression against China in the past. The Indian government bears no responsibility for this. The privileges enjoyed by the former British government and the old Chinese government based on unequal treaties no longer exist due to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, it is necessary for the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India to establish relations in China's Tibet region on a new basis through consultation. At the beginning of the negotiations, the Chinese and Indian delegations unanimously agreed to conduct negotiations on the issue of Sino-Indian relations in China's Tibet region on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. After full consultation, both sides reached an agreement and concluded the agreement. From then on, Sino-Indian relations in China's Tibet region were re-established on a new basis. In order to enhance friendly relations between China and India, the People's Republic of China has consistently adhered to the policy of good-neighborliness and peaceful coexistence, and has striven to develop trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries. The successful agreement reached in the Sino-Indian negotiations once again proves the deep friendship and desire for friendly cooperation of the Chinese people towards the Indian people. In these negotiations, the Indian government gladly withdrew all its armed guards stationed in Yatung and Gyantse in China's Tibet region, and gladly handed over all its postal, telegraph and telephone enterprises and equipment in China's Tibet region to the Chinese government. This measure taken by the Indian government to respect China's sovereignty is in line with the common interests and traditional friendship of the Chinese and Indian peoples. China and India are two large neighboring countries. For many centuries, there have been traditional and close ties between the Tibetan people of China and the Indian people in terms of economic life, social relations, and transportation. For example, trade between merchants, visits between residents in border areas to visit relatives and friends and conduct small-scale trade, and the cross-border travel of porters and muleteers who specialize in transportation to facilitate trade are very close. This agreement and exchange of letters affirm these traditional and normal relations based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and at the same time stipulate a series of reasonable methods for merchants from both sides to conduct normal trade. All this not only meets the actual needs of the lives of the people of both sides, but also provides favorable conditions for further developing trade between the two sides. The Chinese government correctly implements the policy of freedom of religious belief, and therefore respects the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people. At the same time, it is willing to provide convenience to Indian people who customarily come to China's Tibet region for pilgrimage. Therefore, specific provisions are also made in the agreement regarding the pilgrimage of pilgrims from both sides. During the Sino-Indian negotiations, the imperialists repeatedly spread rumors, saying that the Sino-Indian negotiations were "negotiations that lasted for years without results," attempting to use this to sow discord in Sino-Indian relations and undermine the negotiations. However, facts have proved that, thanks to the sincerity of both the Chinese and Indian governments in resolving the issue and the spirit of friendly consultation, both sides smoothly reached an agreement. The imperialists also attempted to sow discord between the Central People's Government of China and the Tibet local government. However, facts have proved that the Tibet local government warmly supports the negotiations and the agreement signed between the Central People's Government and the Indian government. The facts shattered the imperialists' conspiracies and caused them to fail. The success of the Sino-Indian negotiations and the signing of the agreement, as stated in Premier Zhou Enlai's congratulatory telegram to Prime Minister Nehru, will not only further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, but also fully prove that as long as all countries jointly abide by the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and adopt the method of consultation, any existing international problems can be resolved reasonably. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the successful conclusion of the Sino-Indian negotiations and the signing of the agreement, and firmly believe that the governments and peoples of China and India will work together to implement the agreement, so that the friendly relations between China and India will become more cordial and the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples will develop further.

    中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系在新基础上重新建立起来
    我国政府代表团和印度政府代表团在北京举行的关于中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系问题的谈判，业已顺利结束，并于四月二十九日签订了“中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定”，同时互换了照会。中国和印度在中国西藏地方的关系的现存情况，是英国过去侵略中国的过程中所遗留下来的痕迹。对于这一切，印度政府是没有责任的。过去英国政府和旧中国政府基于不平等条约而产生的特权，由于中华人民共和国的成立，已不复存在了。因此，中华人民共和国和印度共和国在中国西藏地方的关系，就有必要通过协商在新的基础上建立起来。中印两国代表团在这次谈判开始时，就一致同意在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则之下，就中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系问题进行谈判。双方在经过充分的协商之后，获致了协议并缔结了协定。从此，中印两国在中国西藏地方的关系在新的基础上重新建立起来了。中华人民共和国为了增进中印两国之间的友好关系，一贯本着善邻与和平相处的方针，努力发展两国之间的贸易和文化交往。这次中印谈判顺利达成协议，再一次证明中国人民对印度人民的深厚友谊和友好合作的愿望。印度政府在这次谈判中愉快地将其驻在中国西藏地方亚东和江孜的武装卫队全部撤退，并愉快地将其在中国西藏地方的邮政、电报和电话等企业及其设备全部交给我国政府。印度政府这种尊重中国主权的措施是符合中印两国人民共同利益和传统友谊的。中国和印度是两个毗邻的大国，许多世纪以来，我国西藏人民和印度人民之间，无论在经济生活、社会关系及交通来往等方面都有着传统的密切联系。比如双方商人间的贸易，边境地区双方居民来往、探望亲友和进行小额贸易，以及为便利贸易而专门从事运输的背夫、骡夫的过境往返等都很密切。这次协定和换文根据平等互惠原则把这些传统的正常关系加以肯定，同时并对于双方商人进行正常贸易规定了一系列的合理的办法。这一切，不仅符合于双方人民生活的实际需要，而且为更进一步发展双方通商贸易提供了有利的条件。我国政府正确地执行着宗教信仰自由的政策，因而是尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯的。同时，对于习惯上到中国西藏地方朝圣的印度人民也愿予以便利。因此，关于双方香客朝圣事宜，在协定中也作了具体规定。在中印谈判期间，帝国主义者曾一再散布谣言，说什么中印谈判是“穷年累月没有结果的谈判”，企图借此挑拨中印关系，破坏谈判。然而，事实证明，由于中印两国政府都抱着解决问题的诚意和友好协商的精神，双方顺利地达成了协议。帝国主义者还曾企图挑拨我国中央人民政府和西藏地方的关系。然而，事实证明，西藏地方政府热诚拥护我中央人民政府和印度政府间的谈判和所签订的协定。事实粉碎了帝国主义者的阴谋，使他们遭到失败。中印谈判的成功和协定的签订，正如我国周恩来总理致尼赫鲁总理的贺电中所说的，不仅将进一步加强中印两国人民之间的友谊，并且充分证明，只要各国共同遵守互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则，采取协商方式，国际间存在着的任何问题，都可获得合理的解决。中国人民热烈祝贺中印谈判的顺利结束和协定的签订，并且深信中印两国政府和人民将共同努力，执行协定，使中印两国的邦交更加敦睦，中印两国人民的友谊更加发展。
