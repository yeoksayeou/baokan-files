Xinhua News Agency, London, April 19th: The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain concluded on April 19th, according to TASS, London.

    The morning session on the 19th discussed several motions put forward by local Party organizations and unanimously passed resolutions on the textile industry, culture, agriculture, and other issues.

    The Congress put forward the following program for the workers' movement: 1. General wage increases and an immediate 15% wage increase for textile workers; 2. Termination of the government's policy of raising food prices; 3. Abolish purchase tax and reduce business owners' profits to lower the prices of British goods in domestic and foreign markets; 4. Develop trade between East and West, abolish U.S. trade restrictions, and hold trade negotiations with countries in the non-dollar zone; 5. Fully recognize the People's Republic of China and admit the People's Republic of China to the United Nations to promote the establishment of normal trade relations between the People's Republic of China and other countries; 6. Stop the policy of war and the policy of suppressing colonial peoples, thereby laying the foundation for establishing friendly relations and expanding trade between Britain and all other countries within the British Empire.

    The Congress passed a resolution on colonial issues, severely condemning British imperialism's wars in Kenya and Malaya, as well as the reactionary alliance formed by British and American imperialism to strengthen their exploitation of the colonies, an alliance which is turning Britain itself into a semi-colony of American imperialism. The resolution demanded: 1. Immediately stop the war in Malaya; 2. Immediately hold negotiations with the leaders of the Kenyan resistance movement, sign a ceasefire agreement, and release political prisoners; 3. Grant the people of Guyana democratic rights and release the arrested leaders of the People's Progressive Party; 4. Withdraw all British troops from countries under British occupation; 5. Withdraw troops stationed in Northern Ireland to restore the unification of Ireland.

    According to the proposal of the Party Executive Committee, the Congress unanimously passed a special resolution protesting the Home Secretary's refusal to allow representatives of Communist Parties from countries outside the British Empire to continue to participate in the conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of the British Empire scheduled for April 21st to 24th.

    Lochran, Chairman of the Congress Organizing Committee, reported to the Congress that at the secret meeting on the 18th, a new Executive Committee composed of forty people was elected. The newly elected Executive Committee includes: Pollitt, Dutt, Gallacher, Campbell, Gollan, Matthews, Kerrigan, Moffat, Bennett, and Piratin, among others.

    Next, the Congress heard and approved the report of the Credentials Committee. The participants in this Congress included: 617 representatives with voting rights; 42 representatives with speaking rights.

    Finally, Campbell delivered the closing speech. The Congress was then adjourned.
