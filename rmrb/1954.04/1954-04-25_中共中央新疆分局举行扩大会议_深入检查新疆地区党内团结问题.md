Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 24th: The Xinjiang Bureau of the CCP Central Committee held an enlarged meeting from April 8th to 17th to convey the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP and the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, and to deeply examine the issue of Party unity in the Xinjiang region.  The meeting was attended by members of the Xinjiang Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, secretaries and deputy secretaries of the CCP South Xinjiang District Committee, local committees, and the Urumqi Municipal Committee, leading Party member cadres of provincial-level agencies, members of the Xinjiang Military Region Party Committee, and senior officers of the troops.

The meeting successively heard Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Bureau, report on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP, Gao Jinchun, member of the Xinjiang Bureau Committee, report on the spirit of the Enlarged Meeting of the Northwest Bureau, and Saifudin, Fourth Secretary of the Xinjiang Bureau, report on "The Summary of Work in Xinjiang Region in 1953 and the Issue of Party Unity in Xinjiang Region." Based on the above reports and in light of the actual conditions in the Xinjiang region, the meeting conscientiously examined various tasks and the issue of Party unity, and conducted extensive and conscious self-criticism. The conference unanimously supported and expressed its determination to implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP and the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau Committee.

The meeting considered that the Party organizations in the Xinjiang region have been basically united in the past and are so at present. Especially after the second Party Congress was held in the summer of 1952, Party unity was further enhanced, thereby effectively ensuring the successful completion of various tasks, especially land reform. The meeting pointed out that the main problem of Party unity in the Xinjiang region is to strengthen the unity between Han cadres from outside and local ethnic minority cadres, and the unity between senior Han cadres from outside and senior local ethnic minority cadres is the key to Party unity in the Xinjiang region. The meeting emphatically pointed out that the main obstacle to Party unity in the Xinjiang region at present is the vestiges of Han chauvinism and local nationalism in the thinking of some comrades. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to overcome these two erroneous ideological tendencies, especially to continue to emphasize overcoming Han chauvinism. The meeting believed that it is necessary to overcome the bourgeois individualism that is currently growing within the Party, such as arrogance, complacency, considering oneself a meritorious veteran, boasting about achievements, concealing shortcomings, departmentalism, and decentralism, and other erroneous thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement the various measures indicated in the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on Enhancing Party Unity," it is necessary to correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and to follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, "starting from unity, reaching unity through criticism or struggle," and to conscientiously examine and overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors that hinder unity. Party committees at all levels must resolutely implement the system of collective leadership, fully develop inner-Party democracy, and struggle against the phenomenon of suppressing criticism. Every Party member and cadre should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen Party spirit training, strengthen organization and discipline, and further improve the level of ideological awareness, so as to continuously enhance Party unity and ethnic unity, thereby uniting the people of all ethnic groups to strive for the realization of the Party's general line for the transition period and the Party's tasks in ethnic minority areas. The meeting also decided to communicate this to Party organizations and Party member cadres at all levels. Wang Enmao gave a concluding speech at the end of the meeting.

    中共中央新疆分局举行扩大会议
    深入检查新疆地区党内团结问题
    【新华社西安二十四日电】中共中央新疆分局在四月八日到十七日召开扩大会议，传达中共中央七届四中全会和中共中央西北局扩大会议的精神，并深入检查了新疆地区党的团结问题。出席会议的有中共中央新疆分局委员，中共南疆区党委、各地委、乌鲁木齐市委的书记、副书记，省级各机关的党员负责干部，新疆军区党委委员和部队的高级干部。
    会议先后听了新疆分局第一书记王恩茂关于中共七届四中全会精神的传达报告、新疆分局委员会委员高锦纯关于西北局扩大会议精神的传达报告和新疆分局第四书记赛福鼎“关于新疆地区一九五三年工作总结与新疆地区党的团结问题”的报告。会议根据上述报告，结合新疆地区的实际情况，对各项工作和党的团结问题，认真地进行了检查，广泛地、自觉地进行了自我批评。大会一致拥护并表示坚决贯彻中共七届四中全会决议和西北局委员会扩大会议的精神。
    会议认为：新疆地区党的组织过去和现在基本上都是团结的。特别在一九五二年夏季召开第二届党代表会议以后，党的团结得到了进一步的增强，从而有力地保证了各项工作、主要是土地改革工作的胜利完成。会议指出：新疆地区党的团结的主要问题，是加强外来汉族党员干部和本地民族党员干部之间的团结，而外来汉族党员高级干部和本地民族党员高级干部之间的团结，又是新疆地区党的团结的关键。会议着重指出，目前新疆地区党的团结主要障碍是部分同志思想中残存着的大民族主义倾向和地方民族主义情绪，因此，必须继续克服这两种错误的思想倾向，特别是仍要强调克服大民族主义倾向。会议认为必须克服目前在党内滋长着的资产阶级个人主义思想情绪，如骄傲自满、功臣自居、摆老资格、夸耀成绩、隐瞒缺点、本位主义和分散主义等错误的思想和行为。因此，必须坚决贯彻执行中共中央“关于增强党的团结的决议”中所指示的各项办法，必须正确地运用批评与自我批评的武器，遵循党中央和毛主席的指示“从团结出发，经过批评或斗争达到团结的目的”，认真检查和克服上述阻碍团结的缺点和错误。各级党委必须坚决贯彻集体领导制度，充分发扬党内民主，向压制批评的现象作斗争。每个党员干部应该加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，加强党性锻炼，加强组织性和纪律性，进一步提高思想觉悟水平，以不断增强党的团结和民族团结，从而团结各族人民，为实现党的过渡时期的总路线和党在民族地区的任务而奋斗。会议并决定向各级党的组织和党员干部分别进行传达。会议最后由王恩茂作了总结。
