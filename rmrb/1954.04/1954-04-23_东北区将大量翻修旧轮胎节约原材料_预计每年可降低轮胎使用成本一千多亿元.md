The Northeast China Transportation Company has established a factory capable of retreading 12,000 tires and repairing 11,000 tires. The Northeast China Transportation Company, the Northeast Branch of the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau, the Shenyang Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and other departments have already sent more than 7,900 old tires for retreading.

Tires on various vehicles, after wearing out over 20,000 kilometers or suffering from localized bursts, often become unusable. In the past, most of these tires were recycled as waste rubber or cut into shoe soles. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel cut more than 100 tires into shoe soles in 1953. However, according to on-site experiments conducted by the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee at the Seventh Rubber Factory, the wear resistance and tensile strength of retreaded tires exceeded the national standards for new tires, and the adhesion was close to the national requirements for new tires. Each retreaded tire can travel 12,000 to 15,000 kilometers. Retreading tires can also save a lot of raw materials and reduce the cost of tire usage. For example, if a tire is retreaded twice, it can save 16 kilograms of raw rubber, 12 kilograms of cotton yarn, and 2 kilograms of steel wire, reducing usage costs by more than 40 percent. According to the estimated total tire sales in the Northeast, the region needs to retread approximately 90,000 tires annually. If each tire is retreaded twice, it can save more than 1,400 tons of raw rubber, more than 1,000 tons of cotton yarn, and 180 tons of steel wire annually, equivalent to the use of 110,000 new tires, reducing tire usage costs by more than 140 billion yuan.

    东北区将大量翻修旧轮胎节约原材料
    预计每年可降低轮胎使用成本一千多亿元
    东北区运输公司建立了可翻新一万二千条、修补一万一千条轮胎的工厂。东北区运输公司和中央有色金属工业管理局东北分局、中华全国合作社联合总社沈阳批发站、鞍山钢铁公司等部门已送去七千九百余条旧轮胎准备翻修。
    各种车辆的轮胎经过二万公里行程的磨损或因局部爆裂，往往就不能使用了。过去，这些轮胎大部被作为废胶回收了，或割成鞋底。如鞍钢一九五三年即有轮胎一百多条割成鞋底。但据东北财政经济委员会在第七橡胶厂实地试验的结果，证明翻修后轮胎的耐磨力、扯断力都超过国家对新胎所规定的标准，密着力也接近国家对新胎要求的标准，每条翻新后的轮胎可行走一万二千公里到一万五千公里。轮胎翻修还可以节约很多原材料，降低轮胎使用的成本。如一条轮胎翻修两次，则可节约生胶十六公斤，棉纱十二公斤，钢丝二公斤，降低使用成本百分之四十以上。按东北轮胎销售总量估计，全区每年需要翻修的轮胎约有九万条。若各按每条翻修两次计算，每年便可节省生胶一千四百余吨，棉纱一千余吨，钢丝一百八十吨，可顶十一万条新胎使用，降低轮胎使用成本一千四百余亿元。
