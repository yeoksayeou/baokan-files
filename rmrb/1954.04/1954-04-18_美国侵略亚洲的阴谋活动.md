U.S. Intensifies Expansion of Intervention in the Indochina War

As the Geneva Conference approaches, U.S. authorities are stepping up the injection of more military aid into the Indochina battlefield, expanding intervention in the Indochina War. This shows that the U.S. authorities intend to sabotage the efforts of the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina through consultation.

According to Reuters, a U.S. State Department spokesman admitted on the 11th that "some of the U.S. Air Force planes stationed in Europe and the Far East have stopped routine work in order to transport urgently needed supplies to French troops in Indochina." According to UPI, the U.S. Far East Air Force authorities announced on the 15th that they would send a squadron of C-119 Flying Boxcars from Japan to the Philippines "to assist in airlifting supplies to the French Union forces in Indochina." In order to conceal the extent of U.S. expansion of intervention in the Indochina War, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Far East Air Force authorities have kept secret the number of aircraft and air force personnel involved in transporting military aid, as well as the source, quantity, and content of these military materials.

At the same time, according to UPI, the U.S. Far East Air Force authorities have transferred another batch of C-119 transport aircraft to the French authorities in Indochina, and another batch of B-26 bombers have also been shipped from Korea to Indochina.

According to UPI, in order to further interfere in the Indochina War, U.S. authorities have dispatched U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Earle Partridge, who arrived in Saigon on the 14th, "to personally study U.S. military aid to the French forces in Indochina." At the same time, U.S. Air Force Secretary Talbott summoned French Air Force Undersecretary Louis Christiaens to Washington on the 13th to discuss U.S. military aid to the French forces in Indochina. According to Agence France-Presse, Christiaens stated at a press conference held after arriving in Washington that France would beg the United States for the "largest possible number" of B-26 bombers and spare parts. He also revealed that France had requested the United States to supply B-29 heavy bombers last week.

In order to accelerate the war effort in Indochina, General O'Daniel, the former commander of the U.S. First Corps in the Korean War and the commander of the U.S. Pacific Army, who has been appointed as the head of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina, rushed to Saigon on the 15th to take up his new post. According to UPI, O'Daniel will "emphasize" to the French authorities in Indochina the "importance" of intensifying the war in Indochina. Everyone knows that the important purpose of the U.S. authorities in sending O'Daniel to this position is to attempt to take over the training and control of the puppet army, thereby seizing command of the war and further controlling the war in Indochina.

Li Clique Clamors Against Geneva Conference, Calls for Resumption of Korean War

"New York Times" reporter Jordan reported that Syngman Rhee said in a conversation with reporters that he "opposed the Geneva Conference." He put forward two plans to resume the Korean War: first, the troops of all United Nations countries willing to support the South Korean army should immediately resume the war; second, General Van Fleet should supervise the implementation of a large-scale plan, funded by the United States, to build up South Korean ground forces, which would resume the war with the support of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Syngman Rhee said he would present this plan to the U.S. Congress. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    美国侵略亚洲的阴谋活动
    美国加紧扩大干涉印度支那战争
    随着日内瓦会议的迫近，美国当局正在加紧把更多的军事援助投入印度支那战场，扩大干涉印度支那战争。这说明美国当局是要破坏日内瓦会议通过协商恢复印度支那和平的努力。
    据路透社报道，美国国务院发言人十一日承认，“驻在欧洲和远东的美国空军的飞机，已有一部分停止了例行的工作，为了把迫切需要的供应品运给在印度支那的法国部队。”据合众社报道，远东美国空军当局在十五日宣布：将从日本派遣一个中队的C—119型飞行车厢式飞机到菲律宾去，“以协助空运供应品给印度支那的法兰西联邦部队”。为了掩盖美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的程度，美国国务院和远东美国空军当局对运送军事援助的飞机的架数和空军人员的人数，以及这些军事物资的来源、数量和内容都秘而不宣。
    同时，据合众社报道，远东美国空军当局已把另外一批C—119型运输飞机移交给印度支那的法军当局，另外一批B—26型轰炸机也已从朝鲜运到印度支那。
    据合众社报道，为了进一步干涉印度支那战争，美国当局已经派遣美国远东空军司令埃尔·帕特里奇在十四日到达西贡，“亲身研究美国对印度支那的法军的军事援助”。同时，美国空军部长泰尔波特在十三日把法国空军次长路易·克里斯吉安叫到华盛顿去，商讨美国对印度支那法军的军事援助。据法新社报道，克里斯吉安在到达华盛顿后举行的记者招待会上表示，法国将向美国乞求“最大数量的”B—26型轰炸机和修配零件。他还透露，法国已在上星期要求美国供给B—29型重轰炸机。
    为了加紧推动印度支那的战争行动，已被任命为美国驻印度支那“军事援助顾问团”团长的前侵朝美军第一兵团司令、美国太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔，已在十五日匆匆赶到西贡就任新职。据合众社报道，奥丹尼尔将向印度支那的法军当局“强调”在印度支那加紧进行战争的“重要性”。大家知道，美国当局派遣奥丹尼尔担任这个职务的重要目的，就是企图把伪军的训练权和控制权接过去，从而夺取战争的指挥权，进一步控制印度支那的战争。
    李匪叫嚣反对日内瓦会议恢复朝鲜战争
    “纽约时报”记者约旦报道，李承晚在一次与记者谈话时说，他“反对日内瓦会议”。他提出了两个恢复朝鲜战争的计划：第一，由所有愿意支持南朝鲜军队的联合国国家的部队立即恢复战争；第二，由范佛里特将军监督实行一个由美国担负经费的大规模建立南朝鲜地面部队的计划，这支地面部队将在美国海、空军的支持下恢复战争。李承晚说：他将向美国国会提出这个计划。（据新华社讯）
