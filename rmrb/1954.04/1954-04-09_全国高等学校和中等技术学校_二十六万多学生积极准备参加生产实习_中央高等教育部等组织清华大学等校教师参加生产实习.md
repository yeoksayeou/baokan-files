More than 260,000 students from universities and secondary technical schools across the country are actively preparing to participate in production internships, and schools in various regions have generally begun preparations. The number of students interning this year is approximately double that of last year, and the content of the internships is also more complex. More than 79,000 students from universities across the country will participate in internships, and more than 185,000 students from secondary technical schools will participate. Among them, more than 49,000 are from higher industrial schools, and more than 70,000 are from secondary industrial technical schools. In addition to introductory internships, most students will undertake professional production internships and graduation internships. This year marks the first time that professional production internships are being conducted nationwide. Students will directly participate in production operations and practical work in relevant units such as work sections, workshops, farms, and laboratories related to their majors, in the capacity of workers or assistants to junior technicians. They will learn production operations and practical work skills, and apply the professional knowledge they have learned to production work. In this production internship, students' internships will be further integrated with the production and work tasks of factories, mines, and other enterprises. Through this internship, the connection between schools and factories, mines, and other enterprises will be further strengthened.

In mid-March, the Central Production Internship Guidance Committee determined and arranged the allocation plan for the internship locations of students from national higher industrial schools in 1954, continuing to adopt the principles of regionalization, systemization, and resolving issues as locally as possible, arranging for students to intern in factories, mines, and enterprises. Higher industrial schools in East China have identified more than 200 factories, mines, and construction sites within the East China region as internship locations, including industrial enterprises in machinery, power, telecommunications, civil engineering, chemical industry, textile, water conservancy, shipbuilding, aviation, and other fields. In addition, some students will intern in Northeast China, North China, Central South China, and other regions. Other major administrative regions have also determined the internship locations for engineering schools. Many universities and secondary technical schools are now actively preparing for internships. Teachers from relevant teaching and research sections of eight higher engineering colleges in the capital, with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, have initially drafted internship outlines and internship plans. Some teachers from the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing and the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, as well as from the Beijing Railway Institute, have gone to the field to understand the situation or have started internships in advance to better guide student internships. Tianjin University fully launched preparations for internships in mid-March. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the inorganic materials major has formulated an internship outline. The water conservancy improvement major invited Soviet experts to give a report and is translating and preparing to study the Soviet internship outline, and will go to the field in mid-April to prepare. Universities and secondary technical schools in East China, Northeast China, Central South China, Southwest China, and other regions have also designated teachers with teaching experience in relevant departments to formulate internship outlines and internship plans based on the professional teaching plans and actual conditions, and have jointly conducted research and revision of the internship outlines and internship plans with technicians from relevant business departments. When formulating internship outlines and plans, teachers from the Department of Hydrology at Sichuan University went to the hydrological survey stations of the Upper Yangtze Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission to conduct on-site observations, and formulated practical internship plans based on the capacity and equipment of the internship locations. Before the internship, the Department of Mining at Northeast Institute of Technology conducted research with the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Management Bureau, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, and some coal mine and metal mine enterprises on the topics of student graduation designs and the content of graduation internships. Shenyang Agricultural College also jointly researched and formulated internship plans with relevant agricultural production units and agricultural experiment and research departments, requiring students to cooperate with relevant departments to solve some specific problems in agricultural production through technical promotion, production operations, and investigation and research internships, and to consolidate the professional knowledge students have learned. Relevant factories and mines also attach great importance to student internships. Some factories and mines have taken the initiative to understand the school's requirements for internships. The chief engineer of the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant also visited the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University to understand the textbooks that students are learning, and donated hundreds of square meters of drawings and other materials to the school. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of production internships, many schools have established special management institutions or assigned special management personnel to organize students to read relevant documents and supplement various necessary theoretical knowledge. Relevant business departments are also actively assisting in students' internship work, and many business departments have established special management institutions. The Southwest Geological Bureau and more than a dozen factories under the Southwest Office of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government have all established production internship guidance committees. The Upper Yangtze Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has also designated technicians to specifically guide students.

Some schools have already started internships. Fourth-year students from Northeast Institute of Technology and Shenyang Agricultural College have been conducting graduation internships in relevant units in Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Hegang, and other places since February 14th. This time, Shenyang Agricultural College has fourth-year students majoring in agronomy, soil science, horticulture, plant protection, and agricultural economics conducting graduation internships at the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang, the Lüda Horticultural Experiment Farm, and other places.

In order to accumulate production internship experience and assist schools in preparing for internships, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government organized the directors of teaching and research sections and related teachers from Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, and Tongji University, including construction, structure, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, and construction science, to go to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site under the guidance of Soviet experts Sadovich and Ilyichev. They completed the investigation of the project situation, arranged the internship schedule and plan, and revised the internship outline.

From late May to early August this year, more than 1,100 undergraduate and special students from the civil engineering, structural engineering, and architecture departments of Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, and Tongji University, majoring in industrial and civil construction, industrial and civil construction structure, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, and architectural design, will conduct production internships at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site. Among them, more than 600 people will conduct professional production internships, directly participating in the technical leadership work of the project as foremen, foreman assistants, and other junior technicians. The engineering company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government, which is responsible for the basic construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, expressed a warm welcome to the teachers and students of the four schools. The company's manager and chief engineer hope that the interning teachers and students will help them better complete their work tasks. They introduced the overall situation of the project to the teachers who went to the construction site this time, and assisted the teachers in visiting the construction site and construction auxiliary enterprises. With the strong support and assistance of the company's负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge], the teachers successfully completed the investigation of the construction site situation, preliminarily arranged the internship schedule and plan, and revised the internship outline. The teachers also collected problems currently existing in the project in terms of construction management, construction technology, design, and processing plant production for research. Some teachers have initially proposed improvement suggestions for some of the problems. The company also hopes that the school and the construction site will strengthen communication in the future, and requires the school to provide textbooks such as "Construction Technology" and "Construction Organization Plan" for the construction site's reference.

In order to strengthen unified leadership and management of students' internship work, the company and the school have preliminarily established a production internship guidance committee. The company has designated a deputy manager to serve as the chairman of the committee, and appointed the chief engineer and the director of the education department as members. The school has nominated the director of the construction teaching and research section of Tsinghua University as the vice chairman of the committee, and one responsible teacher from each of the other three schools as a member. In order to solve the accommodation problems of the interning teachers and students in a coordinated manner, the company has decided to add temporary dormitories in the temporary projects of each construction area on the construction site for the interning students to live in.
