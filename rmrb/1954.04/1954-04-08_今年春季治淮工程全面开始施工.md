Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 7th. More than 600,000 migrant workers and laborers participating in this spring's Huai River project have arrived at various construction sites one after another, and full spring construction began in late March. The scale of this spring's Huai River project remains large. In total, four reservoirs will be built, twenty-two rivers will be dredged, twenty-five culvert gates will be constructed, eight sections of embankments will be repaired, water conservancy projects will be undertaken in three cotton reclamation areas, over one hundred bridges will be built, and two hundred and fifty village platforms will be built in the flood storage area. In addition to the ongoing construction of the Boshan and Nanwan Reservoirs in Henan Province in the upper reaches, and the Foziling Reservoir in Anhui Province in the middle reaches, a Meishan Reservoir will be built upstream of the Shi River, a tributary of the Huai River in Anhui Province. The river dredging projects mainly involve continuing the dredging of the Hong and Hei Rivers in the upper reaches, and starting the dredging of the Fen River and repairing over sixty dangerous sections along the banks of the Sha River; in the middle reaches, the focus is on continuing the drainage and irrigation project of the Bei Fei River and the dredging of the Quan River, while starting the drainage projects for the Qian, Ni, and Hei Rivers. These projects require a total of more than 63 million cubic meters of earthwork. These projects will play a significant role in improving agricultural production on both sides of the Huai River. For example, before the dredging of the Fen River, the embankments in the upper and middle reaches were incomplete, and the riverbed was almost silted up into flat land, causing frequent floods. After the completion of the first phase of the dredging project this spring, more than one million mu of farmland will directly and indirectly benefit. After the repair of the dangerous sections of the Sha River, over 5.9 million mu of farmland on both sides of the Sha River can reduce the threat of floods during the summer flood season. After the completion of the Bei Fei River drainage and irrigation project this year, 1,100 square kilometers of land in Suixi, Huaiyuan, Suxian, and Wuhe counties in northern Anhui Province will be basically free from internal waterlogging disasters in the event of a heavy rain once every five years in the Huai River basin.

Before the full commencement of this spring's Huai River project, the Huai River Commission and relevant Huai River agencies at all levels made a series of relatively thorough preparations, convened various working meetings, and made specific arrangements for engineering, financial, political, and other work. For example, before the start of the Bei Fei River drainage and irrigation project, the headquarters set up many financial and grain transfer stations along the long construction site, and transferred a large amount of grain, coal, and tools. Before the start of the project, the Fuyang Prefectural Huai River Headquarters concentrated on training more than 800 team leaders of the migrant workers' backbone teams. The Suxian Prefectural Huai River Headquarters sent a large number of cadres to various places to help do a good job in mobilizing and organizing migrant workers.

    今年春季治淮工程全面开始施工
   【新华社蚌埠七日电】参加今春治淮工程的六十多万民工和工人已陆续开到各处工地，三月下旬开始了全面的春季施工。今年春季治淮工程的规模仍然很大。总计要建造四座水库，整理二十二条河道，修建二十五座涵闸，培修八处堤防，兴办三处棉垦区的水利工程，建造一百几十座桥梁，在蓄洪区建筑二百五十处村庄的庄台。今年春季要修建的山谷水库除上游河南省的薄山水库、南湾水库，中游安徽省的佛子岭水库继续施工外，安徽省淮河支流史河的上游将建造一座梅山水库。河道整理工程，上游主要是继续做洪河、黑河的整理工程，并开始整理汾河，修理沙河两岸的六十多处险工；中游主要是继续做北淝河排涝灌溉工程和泉河整理工程，同时开始芡河、泥河、黑河的除涝工程。这些工程仅土工共须做六千三百多万公方。这些工程对提高淮河两岸的农业生产将起着重大作用。如汾河，在整理之前，上游、中游堤防残缺，河床几乎淤积成为平地，经常泛滥成灾，今春完成第一期整理工程后，直接和间接受益的农田有一百多万亩。沙河险工修好之后，在夏汛期间，沙河两岸五百九十多万亩农田就可减轻洪水的威胁。北淝河排涝灌溉工程今年全部完成后，安徽省淮北的濉溪、怀远、宿县、五河等四个县一千一百多平方公里的土地如遇到淮河流域五年一次的暴雨时，可基本上免除内涝灾害。
    今年春季治淮工程全面开工前，治淮委员会和各级治淮机构比较充分地作了一系列的准备工作，召开了各种工作会议，对工程、财务、政治等工作作了具体的部署。如北淝河排涝灌溉工程指挥部开工前在很长的工地上分设了许多财粮转运站，调运了大批粮、煤和工具。阜阳专区治淮指挥部开工前集中训练了八百多名民工基干队的队长。宿县专区治淮指挥部曾派出大批干部分赴各地帮助做好了民工的动员组织工作。
