    In Taishan County, Guangdong Province, a famous hometown of overseas Chinese, a large number of returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese were elected as township people's representatives and members of township people's governments in the grass-roots elections. According to preliminary statistics, in Fengshan, Baishui, Shandie, and other fifty-eight townships alone, 231 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese were elected as people's representatives, and in Wufu, Chongpan, and other thirty-three townships, 78 were elected as members of township people's governments. They have made significant contributions to agricultural production and various other tasks, and have set an example among the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and peasants, earning the trust of the voters. Lin Xinyu, a family member of an overseas Chinese worker who was elected as a people's representative in Baishui Township, Eleventh District, actively participated in the Latoushan Flood Diversion Project in the spring of 1953 and won the honorary title of "Latoushan Flood Diversion Model" in the labor competition. Because of her consistently active work and concern for the interests of the masses, she was elected as a member of the township people's government when the township people's government was established. In this general election campaign, she went deep into the masses to conduct propaganda, and in the general election, she united and motivated the relatives of overseas Chinese to engage in production. Her practical actions, such as building dikes and eliminating insects, enhanced the unity between peasants and the relatives of overseas Chinese, and she was deeply loved and supported by the masses. Mai Lanzi, a relative of overseas Chinese and a people's representative of Dawan Township, actively mobilized four peasant households, including Chen Xiuquan, relatives of overseas Chinese, to participate in mutual aid teams in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and promoted their spring plowing and production preparations, enabling the entire team to accumulate more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer in a very short period of time. The voters said: Mai Lanzi is our good representative, a good example for women, and we all support her.
