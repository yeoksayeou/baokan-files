    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Launches Labor Competition to Welcome "May Day"
    All Workshops in the Plant Enthusiastically Propose Competition Conditions
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] The news of the labor competition initiated by the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace in the Iron Smelting Department of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day has spread throughout the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. All workers enthusiastically expressed their support for the production of the No. 1 Blast Furnace and actively responded to the proposal of the No. 1 Blast Furnace to participate in friendly competition.
    After hearing the news that the No. 1 Blast Furnace had launched a labor competition, the technicians on duty at the No. 2 Blast Furnace, together with the workers, calculated and analyzed the production conditions for April overnight. The conditions they proposed for the challenge are as follows: 1. Complete the April national plan twenty hours ahead of schedule, with a blast furnace utilization coefficient reaching 0.911. 2. Eliminate defective products and ensure that the silicon content fluctuation range of pig iron does not exceed 0.25%, and the sulfur content does not exceed 0.02%. 3. Increase labor productivity by 0.5% and reduce costs. 4. Eliminate work-related injuries and equipment-related accidents, and ensure safe production. The small blast furnace proposed the challenge condition of completing the April production task twenty-four hours ahead of schedule, and they also formulated specific guarantee measures for reducing costs and ensuring safe production.
    The workers of the raw material system of the Iron Smelting Department expressed one after another, "In order to produce more iron, we must ensure that the blast furnace is supplied with sufficient qualified raw materials." Ding Shushen, assistant director of raw materials and workshop model engineer, analyzed the technical data of the raw materials for the past three months in detail and proposed specific challenge conditions together with the workers. The workers of the coking workshop proposed ensuring the completion of the coal blending test work for the second quarter, and ensuring that the average ash content of coke does not exceed 13.8, as a condition for the challenge. The technicians and workers of the General Mechanical Office enthusiastically expressed that they would do a good job in repair work. They said, "We must strongly support them. Repair work will only be done ahead of schedule, not postponed." The workers of the Power Department are actively brewing challenge conditions, and many workers actively expressed that they would definitely support the No. 1 Blast Furnace. Hu Zengtian, a worker at the No. 2 Pumping Station, said, "We will definitely complete the overhaul of the No. 6 pump three days ahead of schedule to support the No. 1 Blast Furnace." The boiler team guarantees sufficient steam for the blast furnace. The workers of the telephone bureau guarantee the timely use of telephones by the blast furnace. In order to support the production of the blast furnace, the line workers guarantee that they will resolutely do a good job in the line maintenance work during the rainy season. In addition, the casting department, transportation department, machine shop and other production units have also actively proposed competition conditions. All the workers are welcoming the "May 1st" International Labor Day with joy and are full of confidence in striving for new victories.
