    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The technical innovation movement is gradually unfolding in factories and mines of the Central-South Region. Recently, Wang Haixiang, the leader of the No. 509 drilling rig team at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine and a national model worker in coal drilling, led workers to actively learn from Wang Chonglun's work spirit. They carefully budgeted, sought shortcuts, tapped potential, and set a plan to complete fifteen months' worth of work in ten months, from March to the end of the year, and strived to complete seventeen months' worth of work. Recently, the mine's employees have put forward 328 rationalization proposals focusing on key production issues, including small automatic loaders, small roadheader coal cutters, automatic pipe connectors, and automatic universal saws. Technicians at the Wangfeng Mine also proposed eighteen technical improvement methods, fifteen of which convert heavy manual labor into mechanized operations, saving more than 11,600 man-days per month and reversing the situation where the Wangfeng Mine had been unable to complete its "efficiency targets" since January. Xu Xingdi, a female spinner at the Yubei Cotton Mill, inspired by Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, can now watch 1,400 spindles, reaching the highest national record, and she can complete a year and a half's task in one year.

    In technical innovation, employees in various regions are constantly paying attention to overcoming weak links. The processing workshop of the Changsha Auto Parts Manufacturing Plant improved its labor productivity, and the output of piston rings increased from 3,000 pieces per day to 6,000 pieces per day. The electroplating workshop could not keep up, becoming a weak link. A young man named Li Qingheng researched and improved the electroplating equipment, semi-mechanizing the electroplating work, increasing the daily plating volume from more than 3,000 pieces to more than 7,000 pieces, quickly solving the problem of unbalanced equipment. The production efficiency of the mining and smelting departments of the Xikuangshan Mining Bureau continued to increase, but the washing and selection workshop could not keep up, and a large amount of ore was backlogged from the stopes, failing to meet the needs of the smelting department. Worker Li Quanben created the "sand-turning trough washing" tool, which allowed two or three people to replace the work of eighty or more people, eliminating the weak link in the entire bureau.

    Employees in various regions have also demonstrated the collectivist spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and jointly completing tasks. Guo Xueyi, a worker at the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, initially held the attitude of "as long as my plan is completed, others have nothing to do with me." Later, after learning Wang Chonglun's spirit of helping others improve tools, he realized that building socialism requires everyone's efforts. In February, he did his best to help Shen Qichang, a worker newly transferred from Shanghai, become familiar with the operation of the Czech milling machine. In the production increase and economy drive competition at the Pulin Power Plant's boiler room, each shift engaged in departmentalism, resulting in some shifts completing their plans while others did not; even when shifts completed their plans, the plant plan was not completed. In the technical innovation movement, workers unanimously expressed that they would use their brains in the future, find loopholes in operations and machines, unite and help each other, and strive to complete the national plan.

    技术革新运动在中南工厂矿山中逐渐展开
    【本报讯】中南区工厂矿山的技术革新运动，正在逐渐开展。最近焦作煤矿钻探队五○九号钻探机机长、全国煤业钻探劳动模范王海祥带领工人积极学习王崇伦的工作精神，精打细算，找窍门，挖潜力，订出从三月到年底十个月完成十五个月工作量的计划，并争取完成十七个月的工作量。该矿职工在最近期间围绕生产关键问题，提出合理化建议三百二十八件，其中有小型自动装车机，小型送道割煤机、自动接捞子管、自动万能锯等。王封矿的技术员也提出十八项技术改进办法，其中十五项是把笨重的体力劳动改变为机械化的，一个月就能节省一万一千六百多个人工，并能扭转王封矿从一月以来一直完不成“效率指标”的局面。豫北纱厂细纱女工许杏娣在王崇伦革新精神鼓舞下，已能看一千四百个锭子，达到全国最高纪录，她一年内能完成一年半的任务。
    各地职工在技术革新中，不断注意克服薄弱环节。长沙汽车配件制造厂加工车间因劳动生产率提高，活塞环的产量由日产三千片提高到六千片，镀电车间赶不上，成了薄弱环节，青年李庆恒就研究改进了镀电设备，使镀电工作半机械化，由日镀三千多片提高到七千多片，迅速地解决了设备不均衡的问题。锡矿山矿务局采矿和冶炼部门生产效率不断增长，而洗选车间赶不上，出窿矿石大量积压，不能满足冶炼部门的需要，工人李泉本创造了“翻砂槽洗”工具，两三个人就可代替八十多人的工作，消除了全局的薄弱环节。
    各地职工还发挥了团结互助、共同完成任务的集体主义思想。开封机械厂工人郭学义起初是抱着“只要自己的计划完成算了，别人与我无关”的态度，后来学习王崇伦帮助别人改进工具的精神，认识到建设社会主义要靠大伙来努力。二月份，他尽力帮助新从上海调来的工人沈其昌熟悉捷式铣床的操作。普临电厂锅炉间工人在增产节约竞赛中，各班闹本位主义，结果这班完成了计划，那班完不成；完成了班计划，完不成厂计划。在技术革新运动中，工人们一致表示今后要开动脑筋，从操作中、机器中找漏洞，团结互助，为完成国家计划而努力。
