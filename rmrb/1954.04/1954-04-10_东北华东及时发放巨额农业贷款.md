    The Northeast Branch of the People's Bank of China will issue over 1,100 billion yuan in agricultural loans this year (including loans issued last year that have not yet been recovered) to help farmers increase production and develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    About half of these loans will be used to help farmers improve agricultural cultivation techniques and purchase production materials such as horse-drawn farm implements, integrated shovel harrows, draft horses, stud horses, ammonium sulfate, and agricultural pesticide equipment. In provinces like Rehe and Liaoxi, which are suitable for building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, loans will be issued for small-scale farmland water conservancy; in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, loans will focus on supporting the development of vegetable and various non-staple food production. In addition, it is planned to issue a certain amount of loans to rural credit cooperatives, herdsmen, fishermen, and rural handicraftsmen.

    Three-quarters of the Northeast region's annual agricultural loans will be issued during the spring plowing season. People's Banks in various parts of the region are now actively carrying out the issuance work. In March, 18 counties in Jilin Province, including Yanji and Hunchun, loaned 4 billion yuan in cash to farmers. The Shenyang City Branch of the People's Bank of China began investigating the situation and issuing loans in the suburbs in early February. By mid-March, it had issued more than 23.6 billion yuan. Farmers who received loans purchased draft animals, waterwheels, and fertilizers in a timely manner for production. Vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang also built greenhouses for cultivating vegetables and dug wells for watering vegetables.

    People's Banks in East China will issue 2,850 billion yuan in agricultural loans this year (including loans issued last year that have not yet been recovered) to support farmers in increasing the production of grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials.

    Since the beginning of spring, People's Banks in various parts of East China have been actively preparing for the issuance of agricultural loans. The Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China sent cadres to the three counties of Shuyang, Jiangning, and Yancheng in February to conduct key investigations into the farmers' needs for loans. The Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China conducted trial loan programs in two base-point townships in Xindeng and Xiaoshan. Now, various places have successively begun issuing agricultural loans. Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces have issued large quantities of wheat fertilizer loans and fishery loans. The issuance of 22 billion yuan in water conservancy loans in Anhui Province has already begun. The 35 million yuan in loans issued by the Linji District of Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, helped more than 850 farmers solve difficulties in production and life. The water conservancy loans issued by Sheyang County helped farmers open many new small rivers, solving the irrigation difficulties of nearly 10,000 mu of paddy fields.

    东北华东及时发放巨额农业贷款
    中国人民银行东北区行今年将发放一万一千余亿元的农业贷款（包括去年贷出尚未收回的贷款），扶助农民增加生产，发展互助合作运动。
    这些贷款，有半数左右将用来帮助农民改进农业耕作技术，添购马拉农具、综合号铲趟机、耕马、种马、硫铵以及农药器械等生产资料。在适于兴修小型农田水利的热河、辽西等省，将发放小型农田水利贷款；在大、中城市和工矿区，贷款着重用来扶持发展蔬菜及各种副食品生产。此外，还计划对农村信用合作社、牧民、渔民、农村手工业者等发放一定数量的贷款。
    东北区全年农业贷款的四分之三要在春耕期间发放，现在该区各地人民银行已积极展开发放工作。吉林省延吉、珲春等十八个县，在三月间已贷给农民四十亿元现款。中国人民银行沈阳市分行在二月初就在郊区一面了解情况，一面进行贷放，到三月中旬，已发放了二十三亿六千多万元。得到贷款的农民，都添购了耕畜、水车、肥料等，及时投入生产；沈阳市郊的种菜农民还修建了培植蔬菜的温室，打了浇菜的水井。
    华东区各地人民银行今年将发放农业贷款二万八千五百亿元（包括去年贷出还没有收回的贷款），以支持农民增产粮食、棉花和其他工业原料。
    入春以来，华东各地人民银行即积极进行了发放农业贷款的准备工作。中国人民银行江苏省分行曾于二月份派干部到沭阳、江宁、盐城三个县重点调查了农民需要贷款的情况；中国人民银行浙江省分行在新登、萧山选择了两个基点乡进行了试放。现在，各地已先后开始发放农业贷款。山东、浙江、江苏等省已发放大批麦肥贷款和渔业贷款；安徽省二百二十亿元水利贷款的发放工作已经开始。江苏省淮安县林集区发放的三千五百多万元贷款，帮助八百五十多户农民解决了生产和生活上的困难；射阳县发放的水利贷款，帮助农民新开了许多小河，解决了近一万亩水田灌溉的困难。
