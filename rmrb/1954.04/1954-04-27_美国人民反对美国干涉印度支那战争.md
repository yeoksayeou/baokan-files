Xinhua News Agency, April 24th dispatch from New York (TASS): A "Workers Daily" reporter reported from Chicago: A conference attended by 12,000 Chicago meatpacking workers passed a resolution denouncing U.S. military measures in Indochina. The reporter reported that despite threats from "Armour Company," "Swift Company," and "Wilson Company" to suspend the workers attending the meeting for a day, the workers still met in the rain. The conference also passed a resolution demanding higher wages.

Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The fact that the American people oppose U.S. intervention in the Indochina War has been proven even in "opinion polls" conducted by institutions controlled by the American bourgeoisie.

The Gallup Poll recently announced after conducting a survey on the Geneva Conference issue: "Our survey consistently shows that public opinion strongly opposes the proposal to send American troops to war."

NBC News commentator Dreier asked listeners a question: "Do you want the United States to intervene in Indochina with armed forces?" asking listeners to express their opinions. It is said that among the 4,600 replies he received, 55.7 percent opposed sending armed forces to Indochina. Among these people, 46.4 percent firmly stated: "No matter what, don't let us get involved in the war."

The American people's strong opposition to U.S. intervention in the Indochina War has made the U.S. ruling group uneasy. They are particularly worried that this may make it difficult for them to deceive the American people into voting for them in the U.S. congressional elections to be held this November. Some American politicians are therefore also opposed to making "rash moves" in an "election year."

    美国人民反对美国干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：“工人日报”记者自芝加哥报道：有一万二千名芝加哥肉类罐头工业工人参加的一个大会，通过了一项决议，斥责美国在印度支那采取的军事措施。记者报道，尽管“阿摩尔公司”、“斯威大特公司”和“威尔逊公司”威胁要停止参加会议的工人们一天的工作，但工人们还是在雨中开会。大会还通过了一个要求提高工资的决议。
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国人民反对美国干涉印度支那战争，这一点即使在美国资产阶级所控制的机构举行的“民意测验”中也得到了证明。
    盖洛普民意测验所最近在就日内瓦会议问题举行调查后宣布：“本所的调查，一贯地说明，舆论是竭力反对派遣美国部队参加战争的主张的。”
    美国全国广播公司新闻评论员德赖尔向听众提出一个问题：“你们希望美国以武装部队在印度支那进行干涉吗”，要求听众表示意见。据说，在他收到的四千六百件答复中，百分之五十五点七反对派武装部队到印度支那去。在这些人当中，百分之四十六点四坚决地表示：“不管怎样，不要让我们卷入战争。”
    美国人民强烈反对美国干涉印度支那战争的情绪使美国统治集团感到不安。他们特别担心的是：这可能使他们在将于今年十一月举行的美国国会选举中难于骗取美国人民的选票。某些美国政客因此也不赞成在“选举年”“轻举妄动”。
