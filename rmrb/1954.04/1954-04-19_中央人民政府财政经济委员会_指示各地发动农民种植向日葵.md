    Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee
    Directs All Regions to Mobilize Farmers to Plant Sunflowers
    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions, requiring all regions to mobilize farmers to expand the scope of sunflower planting.

    The instructions stated: Sunflowers can grow in saline-alkali soil, with a general yield of about 200 jin per mu, and each 100 jin can produce 50 jin of kernels, with an oil content of about 40 percent. Single plants grown on field edges and field heads yield even more. In addition to the seeds being used for oil extraction, the oil residue and crushed stalks of sunflowers can also be used as livestock feed. All regions should mobilize farmers to plant sunflowers in large quantities in vacant land around houses, field heads, field ridges, and ditch edges. Some wasteland north of the Yangtze River that is not suitable for planting grain or cotton can also be planted. During the planting and growing period of sunflowers, all regions should provide guidance on cultivation techniques, and after harvest, the supply and marketing cooperatives should purchase them at reasonable prices.

    The instructions require that when collecting agricultural taxes, the financial departments in all regions should implement the policy of exempting agricultural tax for three years on wasteland cultivated by farmers for planting sunflowers; sunflowers planted on scattered vacant land such as next to houses and field edges should not be included in the scope of taxation. This tax policy must be clearly explained to farmers to encourage their enthusiasm for planting sunflowers.

    中央人民政府财政经济委员会
    指示各地发动农民种植向日葵
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会最近发出指示，要求各地号召农民扩大向日葵种植范围。
    指示说：向日葵在沙碱土上都能生长，一般每亩可收二百斤左右，每百斤可出仁五十斤，含油量约为百分之四十。地边田头上种植的单株，收获量更大。向日葵除种籽可榨油外，油渣和压碎的秸秆并可作为牲畜饲料。各地应发动农民在宅旁空地、地头、田埂和渠边大量种植，长江以北有些不宜种植粮、棉的荒地，也可以种植。各地在向日葵种植和生长期间，要进行栽培技术指导，收获后由供销社按合理价格收购。
    指示要求各地财政部门在征收农业税时，对农民利用荒地种植向日葵，应贯彻开的荒地免纳农业税三年的政策；对利用宅旁地边等零散隙地种植的向日葵，不应列入计征范围。这一税收政策必须向农民交代清楚，以鼓励其种植向日葵的积极性。
