Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government held a basic construction factory director conference to summarize the basic experiences of basic construction work in 1953 and to deploy the guiding principles and tasks for work in 1954.

The conference pointed out that 1953 was the first year of the machine building industry entering large-scale construction. Despite the heavy tasks, weak forces, and lack of experience, the annual basic construction workload completed 100.25 percent of the state plan. Among them, ten key construction units completed 105.32 percent of the plan. Last year, China's machine building industry began the construction of automobile manufacturing plants, measuring tool and cutting tool plants, and large-scale machine tool plants, motor plants, etc. The completion of these factories will play a significant role in China's socialist industrialization. Last year, in order to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks and prepare conditions for future construction, the First Ministry of Machine Building also gathered a large number of design and construction forces, established four design bureaus, one civil engineering design company, seven engineering companies and several engineering offices, two installation companies, and eight exploration teams. The formation of this force was one of the main factors for the First Ministry of Machine Building's successful completion of last year's basic construction tasks. While summarizing the above achievements, the conference also pointed out the shortcomings in the basic construction work in 1953.

The conference, based on the requirements of the state and summarizing the work in 1953, put forward the guiding principles and tasks for basic construction in 1954. The characteristics of the basic construction work of the First Ministry of Machine Building in 1954 are: large investment in factories and enterprises; large amount of installation engineering, and complex installation machines, high quality requirements, and tight schedules; complex structure of construction projects and high technical requirements; urgent requirements for production preparation work before formal commencement of work; and heavy tasks for the preparation of new factories. Therefore, the guiding principle for the basic construction work of the First Ministry of Machine Building this year is to strengthen planning work, focus on key projects, strengthen the installation force, earnestly prepare for production, and assist construction units in implementing the policy of good, fast, and economical construction, in order to complete the annual basic construction tasks. Each factory should formulate a year-round work plan based on this guiding principle and in conjunction with its own specific circumstances.

In order to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks, the conference particularly emphasized the implementation of the policy of focusing on key construction. The conference pointed out that only by ensuring key construction can we realize the guiding principles and tasks of the machine building industry in implementing the general line of the state. Any ideas and requirements that only consider the interests of the unit and ignore the overall interests are wrong. In order to do a good job in basic construction, the conference required that we must first strengthen planning work, do a good job in the long-term plan for basic construction, determine key construction projects, and make a comprehensive overall plan for each construction project, from the preparation of the factory to putting it into production, so that all aspects of the construction work are organized through the overall plan. In addition, annual and quarterly plans, as well as short-term operation plans, should be made to ensure that the work proceeds according to the scheduled progress. Secondly, we must attach great importance to and rely on the leadership of the local committees of the Communist Party of China, pay attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and organize cadres to conduct systematic professional study. Finally, we must improve the ideological nature of our work. In our work, we must establish an overall perspective, promote collaboration, promote collectivism, and resolutely oppose individualism and departmentalism. In addition, in basic construction work, we must also promote thrift, oppose waste, and establish an economic accounting ideology that cherishes public property. In terms of the ideological style of cadres, we must oppose complacency and require cadres to continuously improve their ideological and work levels.

During the conference, the representatives attending the conference listened to the experience introductions made by representatives from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Harbin Motor Plant, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, and other units on the preparation of new factories, production preparation, organization and supervision by Party A, equipment installation, and other work, and conducted discussions.

The conference was held from March 25 to April 6.

    第一机械工业部召开基本建设厂长会议部署今年工作
    决定加强计划工作抓住重点工程
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府第一机械工业部举行基本建设厂长会议，总结了一九五三年基本建设工作的基本经验，部署了一九五四年工作的方针和任务。
    会议指出：一九五三年是机械工业进入大规模建设的第一年，在任务重、力量弱、经验缺乏的情况下，全年基本建设的工作量，完成了国家计划百分之一百点二五。其中十个重点建设单位完成计划百分之一百零五点三二。去年，我国机械工业开始了汽车制造厂、量具刃具厂以及大型的机床厂、电机厂等的建设工作。这些工厂的建成，对我国的社会主义工业化将发挥重大作用。去年，第一机械工业部为保证基本建设任务的完成并为今后的建设准备条件，还集结了大批设计和施工力量，建立了四个设计分局，一个土木建筑设计公司，七个工程公司和若干工程处，两个安装公司和八个勘探队。这批力量的组成，是第一机械工业部胜利完成去年基本建设任务的主要因素之一。会议在总结上述成绩的同时，也指出了一九五三年基本建设工作中的缺点。
    会议根据国家的要求并在总结一九五三年工作的基础上，提出了一九五四年基本建设的方针和任务。一九五四年，第一机械工业部基本建设工作的特点是：工厂企业投资大；安装工程量大，而且安装的机器复杂，质量要求高，时间紧迫；建筑工程的结构复杂，技术要求也高；正式开工以前的生产准备工作要求急；新厂筹备工作任务繁重。因此今年第一机械工业部基本建设工作的方针是加强计划工作，抓住重点工程，壮大安装力量，认真作好生产准备工作，协助施工单位贯彻好、快、省的方针，以完成全年基本建设任务。各厂应根据这一方针，结合本身具体情况制订全年工作计划。
    为保证基本建设任务的完成，会议特别强调贯彻重点建设的方针。会议指出，只有保证重点建设，才能实现机械工业在执行国家总路线中的方针和任务，任何只考虑单位利益，忽视整体利益的思想和要求都是错误的。为做好基本建设工作，会议要求首先必须加强计划工作，做好基本建设的长远计划，确定重点建设项目，对每一建设项目，从建厂筹备工作到投入生产，应作出全面的整体计划，使建设工作的各个环节，通过整体计划被组织起来。另外还应作好年度、季度计划以及短期的作业计划，保证工作按照预定进度进行。其次，必须十分重视和依靠中国共产党地方党委的领导，注意学习苏联先进经验和坚决贯彻苏联专家的建议，并组织干部进行系统的业务学习。最后必须提高工作的思想性。在工作中必须树立整体观点，提倡协作，提倡集体主义，坚决反对个人主义和本位主义。此外，在基本建设工作中还要提倡节约，反对浪费，树立爱护公共财物的经济核算思想。在干部的思想作风上，必须反对骄傲自满，要求干部不断地提高思想和工作水平。
    会议期间，参加会议的代表听取了第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨电机厂、沈阳重型机器厂等单位代表所作关于新厂筹备、生产准备、甲方组织监督、设备安装等工作的经验介绍，并进行了讨论。
    会议是三月二十五日到四月六日举行的。
