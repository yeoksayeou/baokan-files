    Correctly Resolve Problems Arising from the Expansion of Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    Editor's Note: Recently, many readers have written to reflect that, in the work of expanding agricultural production cooperatives, some cadres and members of agricultural production cooperatives are unwilling to accept new members, fearing that an increase in the number of households in the cooperative would make management difficult and affect their income. Some agricultural production cooperatives have even come up with various excuses to restrict the masses from joining. Therefore, many readers have raised the question: will the expansion of agricultural production cooperatives have any impact on the cooperative's management and the income of its members, and how should this problem be solved? We now give a brief reply to this question as follows:

    Expanding agricultural production cooperatives must be carried out confidently under the conditions of production needs, voluntary participation of the masses, and the presence of strong leading cadres. Expanding agricultural production cooperatives under suitable conditions and with confidence will not only have no impact on the cooperative's management and the income of its members, but will also directly benefit the development of agricultural production. Because as agricultural production cooperatives gradually expand, land increases and the labor force also increases. Under such circumstances, it becomes possible to make full use of the land to plant various crops, and to divide labor and industries according to the specialties of the members. This creates favorable conditions for developing and improving agricultural production.

    Here, we take the Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaoshanggou, Second District, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province as an example: When this cooperative was established in 1951, it had 21 households and 298 mu of cultivated land, with an average yield of 225 jin per mu. In the third year, it expanded to 165 households, with 1,256 mu of cultivated land, and the average yield per mu was 270.3 jin, an increase of more than 45 jin compared to the first year. Shi Li, an old member, received 16.5 shi of grain in the first year of joining the cooperative, which increased to 21 shi of grain in the third year. Why did the expansion of the cooperative lead to increased yield and income? Because after the land was consolidated, the original 723 small plots became 246 large plots; this not only eliminated field boundaries and corners, expanding the cultivated area by 28 mu, but also reduced round trips in cultivation, saving more than 1,000 labor days in a year. In the first year of the cooperative's establishment, member Du Changcheng had 30 mu of land divided into 30 plots, planted eight kinds of crops, and harvested 33 shi of grain; later, the cooperative expanded, making it possible to consolidate the land into one piece. That year, 30 mu of land with the same soil quality was all planted with millet, and one crop yielded 73 shi. The members' conclusion after the expansion was "Land consolidation and people's unity, increased yield and labor saving." Secondly, due to the abundance of manpower, there were more favorable conditions for improving cultivation techniques and methods. In 1953, the Wang Jinyun Cooperative used surplus labor to cover 416 mu of sandy land with black and red soil, improving the soil. Each mu of land was cultivated three times and harrowed four times in the first year, and cultivated four times and harrowed five times in the second and third years. Things that could not be done by small cooperatives with limited manpower in the past can now be done because the expanded cooperative has more manpower.

    The above examples show that the expansion of agricultural cooperatives will not affect the income of the original members. Because new members earn remuneration based on their labor and production investment; land is assessed and joined based on soil quality, complexity of operation, and perennial yield; labor is also assessed and scored under the cooperative's unified management according to physical strength and technical skill; and livestock and farm tools are also reasonably compensated. Although old members have accumulated a certain amount of public accumulation funds and public property after several years of operation in the cooperative, this part of the property is not the credit of one person, but the result of the hard work and production efforts of all members under the correct leadership of the Party and the government. When expanding the cooperative, the public accumulation funds accumulated by the old members in the past should belong to the collective ownership of the cooperative. If everyone agrees that members can take away public accumulation funds when withdrawing from the cooperative, the old members still have a share. New members should also pay a share of production funds (such as seeds, fertilizers, feed, cash, etc.) based on their land labor occupation and actual economic ability when joining the cooperative. However, if new members are required to share the past capital accumulation equally and make up the full amount, it will inevitably prevent some poor households from joining. For the continued development of the cooperative cause, we must constantly and timely absorb new members, and we should especially help poor households who want to join, and implement the Party Central Committee's class line of relying on the poor peasants and solid alliance of middle peasants, developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants. If the local masses trust the cooperative and urgently request to join, and some old members are afraid of the entry of difficult households and new members, and refuse difficult households and new members on the pretext of management difficulties and lack of expansion conditions, it is obviously wrong. This not only hinders the continued development and improvement of the cooperative, but also violates the Party's line; because poor peasants actively participate in and support the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Only by relying on the solid alliance of poor peasants and middle peasants, and only by new and old members helping each other and uniting in production, can all members achieve higher production results and more economic benefits, and can the consolidation and development of the cooperative cause be guaranteed.

    Of course, from the perspective of the cooperative's leadership, the cooperative's management may encounter some difficulties when the number of households increases and the land and labor force increase. First of all, with more land, there is a need for more rational and meticulous planning in the use of land; at the same time, with more people, it is necessary to save a large number of labor force, and this labor force must be organized in a planned way and appropriately used for local land infrastructure construction or the development of sideline production. Therefore, whether or not an agricultural production cooperative should be expanded must be determined based on the foundation of the original cooperative and specific conditions. If it can be expanded, it must be expanded. However, before expanding the cooperative, it is necessary to consider whether the cooperative's leading cadres are fair and capable, whether the original cooperative's management foundation is good, whether the cooperative's yield has increased, whether the members' income has increased, and whether the members' emotions are stable; secondly, it is also necessary to analyze whether the farmers who request to join have truly recognized the benefits of the cooperative and request to join. If cooperatives are blindly expanded without considering specific conditions, it will bring difficulties to management, losses to the income of members, and adverse effects on the masses outside the cooperative.

    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, timely attention to absorbing new members and expanding agricultural production cooperatives under suitable conditions is the task of every cooperative cadre. In the expansion work, as long as we adhere to the class line, firmly grasp the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and correctly treat the problems that occur in the expansion and construction of cooperatives, then all problems can be reasonably solved. At present, the expansion and construction work of cooperatives in various places will come to an end and enter spring plowing production. Everyone must pay special attention to giving enthusiastic help to new members, uniting in production, and laying a good foundation for the steady expansion of agricultural production cooperatives in the future.

### 正确解决农业生产合作社扩大中产生的问题

    正确解决农业生产合作社扩大中产生的问题
    编者按：最近有不少读者来信反映，在扩大农业生产合作社的工作中，有部分农业生产合作社的干部和社员不愿意接受新社员入社，他们唯恐合作社的户数增加了，管理起来会有困难，会影响自己的收入。有些农业生产合作社还想出了种种借口来限制群众入社。因此，许多读者提出：农业生产合作社扩大了，对合作社的经营管理和社员的收入究竟有无影响，并询问究竟应该怎样解决这个问题。现在我们对这个问题简复如下：
    扩大农业生产合作社，必须在生产需要，群众自愿和具有坚强领导骨干的条件下，有把握地进行。有条件、有把握地扩大农业生产合作社，不仅对社的经营管理和社员的收入没有影响，而且是直接有利于农业生产的发展。因为农业生产合作社逐渐扩大以后，土地增多了，劳动力也增加了，在这样的情况下，就有可能充分利用地力种植各种作物，按照社员的专长分工分业，这就为发展和提高农业生产创造了有利条件。
    这里我们举山西武乡县二区窑上沟王锦云农业生产合作社为例：这个社在一九五一年建立的时候，全社二十一户，耕地二百九十八亩，每亩平均产量是二百二十五斤。第三年扩大到一百六十五户，耕地一千二百五十六亩，每亩平均产量是二百七十点三斤，比第一年超过了四十五斤多。社员史理老汉入社第一年分到了十六石五斗粮食，第三年增加到二十一石粮食。为什么社扩大了，产量会得到提高、收入会得到增加呢？因为这个社在土地连片以后，原有的七百二十三小块土地变成了二百四十六块大块地；这不仅因为去了地头地角，扩大了耕地面积二十八亩，而且在耕作上减少了来回往返，一年内节省了一千多个劳动日。建社第一年，社员杜长成有三十亩地分成三十片，种了八种作物，收了三十三石粮食；后来社扩大了，有条件将土地连成一片，当年有同样土质的三十亩一片地全种上谷子，一茬就收了七十三石。社员们对扩大后的结论是“土地连片人连心、产量提高又省工。”其次，由于人力充裕，在改良耕作技术、改进耕作方法方面，也就具备了更有利的条件。一九五三年王锦云社利用剩余劳动力，把四百一十六亩沙土地垫上了黑红土，改良了土壤，每一亩地也由第一年耕三遍耙四遍，到第二、三年耕上四遍耙上五遍。过去小社人手少不能办的事情，现在因为社扩大了人手多就能办起来。
    以上的例子可以看出，农业合作社扩大了是不会影响原有社员的收入的。因为新社员入社，是依靠自己的劳动和生产投资来取得报酬的；土地入社是根据土质优劣、经营繁简以及常年产量评产入社的；劳动力也是按照了体力强弱、技术高低在社的统一管理下进行评工记分的；牲口农具方面，也取得合理的报酬。虽说老社员在社内经营了几年，曾积累了一定数量的公积金和公共财产，但是，这部分财产并不是那一个人的功劳，而是全体社员在党和政府的正确领导下刻苦经营、努力生产的结果。在扩社时，对于老社员过去所积累下来的公积金，应属于社的集体所有。如果大家公议退社可带走公积金的话，老社员还是有份的。新社员入社时也应按自己土地劳力占有情况和实际经济能力交纳一份生产资金（如种籽、肥料、饲料、现金等）。但是假若要新社员按照过去资金积累数平均分摊，如数补齐，势必拒绝部分贫困户入社。为了合作事业的继续发展，我们必须经常地适时地吸收新社员，特别对贫困户要求入社的，更应该热忱地帮助，贯彻党中央依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，发展互助合作，限制富农剥削的阶级路线。如果当地群众信任合作社，迫切要求入社，有些老社员怕困难户和新社员入社，而借口管理困难，不具备扩建条件，拒绝困难户和新社员进来，显然是不对的。这不仅阻碍社的继续发展和提高，而且是违犯党的路线的；因为贫农是积极参加和拥护互助合作运动的。只有依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，只有新老社员互相帮助团结生产，才能使全体社员获得更高的生产成绩和更多的经济利益，才能保证合作事业的巩固和发展。
    当然，从合作社的领导来说，在户数增多、土地劳力增加的情况下，社的经营管理可能会碰到一些困难的。首先土地多了，在计划利用土地方面，就要求更加合理更加周密；同时人员一多，必然要节省大批的劳动力，必须有计划地组织这批劳动力，适当地利用于当地土地基本建设或开展副业生产。因此，农业生产合作社应不应该扩大，必须根据原有社的基础和具体条件来决定，可以扩大应该扩大的就一定要扩大。但是在扩大社以前，一定要考虑一下，社的领导干部是不是公道的、能干的，原有社经营管理的基础搞的好不好，社的产量是不是提高了，社员的收入是不是增加了，社员的情绪是不是巩固；其次，还要分析一下，要求入社的农户，是不是真正认识了合作社的好处而要求入社的。如果不看具体条件而盲目扩大合作社，就会给经营管理带来困难，给社员的收入带来损失，给社外群众造成不良影响。
    随着互助合作运动的开展，适时地注意吸收新社员，并有条件地扩大农业生产合作社是每个社干部的任务，在扩建工作中，只要我们坚持阶级路线，紧紧掌握自愿互利的原则，正确地对待在扩社和建社中所发生的问题，那末，一切问题是可以得到合理解决的。目前各地扩社和建社工作将告一段落进入春耕生产，大家必须特别注意对新社员给以热情帮助，团结生产，为今后稳步扩大农业生产作合社打下良好的基础。
