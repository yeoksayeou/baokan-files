On April 4th, Tsinghua University faculty and students joyfully celebrated the forty-third anniversary of the university. On this day, they hosted more than 20,000 Tsinghua University alumni and staff from industrial departments and government organs who came to participate in the anniversary celebration.

Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, Wang Heshou, Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Duan Junyi, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Li Fanyi and Xu Daben, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, Shi Zhiren, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Gao Shiqi, an old alumnus and scientist of Tsinghua University, all came to the university to offer their congratulations. On the 5th, continued guests included Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Union, Huang Jing, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Wang Daohan, Vice Minister, Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, and Luo Yi, Qu Tangliang, and Zhang Ze, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

Among the guests were also more than two hundred international friends.

On the 4th, all the laboratories and exhibition rooms of the seven departments of Tsinghua University were open. The exhibition rooms of each department were crowded with visitors from morning to night. The exhibition room of the Department of Architecture aroused the greatest interest among the guests. Here were displayed various beautiful and colorful designs of houses, schools, sanatoriums, grand theaters, etc., created by the future young architects – the students of the Department of Architecture. A model of a tower crane that was being raised and lowered in front of the Civil Engineering Hall attracted thousands of spectators. In the laboratory, there was also a model of the Erlang Mountain area of the Kangzang Highway, occupying an area of ten square meters. On a concrete flume next to the Water Conservancy Hall, someone was driving a small electric car, which was a flow velocity meter calibration station set up by the Water Conservancy Department. The first water conservancy hub project in our country's institutions of higher learning is about to be completed. The guide pointed to the dam and said to everyone: After the completion of this dam, it can supply 10 to 15 kilowatts of electricity, which can be used by teachers and students of the hydraulic structure major for practice and scientific research. The cooling pool exhibited by the Department of Power Machinery for gas turbines and generator circulating water cooling splashed water like a fountain. The exhibition also included a model of an iron tower for the recently established 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line. The Radio Department exhibited the entire process from transmitter to receiver, demonstrating how sound waves are transmitted to distant places using radio waves, and assembling vacuum systems and electron tube manufacturing procedures. Each department also used pictures and various physical objects to introduce how teachers are working hard to learn from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms, and how to cultivate students to become all-round talents.

At the same time as the visits, symposiums and get-togethers began. Lin Zongtang, an alumnus of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing and a model Communist Party member, gave a report to more than 400 students on his experiences after joining the workforce. Students majoring in highway engineering in the Department of Civil Engineering and staff members of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government gathered happily in the Science Hall, cordially exchanging views on work and study. First-year students also excitedly sang the song of the exploration team. All the teachers of the Hydraulics Teaching and Research Section of Tianjin University, who came specially from Tianjin, held a forum with the teachers of the Water Conservancy Department of Tsinghua University after the visit to exchange experiences in teaching work. Teachers and students of other departments also held discussions with alumni and guests from industrial departments. They hoped to strengthen contact in the future to make theory and practice more closely integrated.

Most of the international friends among the guests were Soviet experts from various universities and industrial departments. After visiting the exhibitions of various departments, a Soviet expert said to the comrade who was receiving him: Under your guidance, I have very interestingly seen the teaching work of Chinese universities, and how people here love science and respect science!

In the afternoon, athletes from Tsinghua University and other universities also performed friendship matches such as football, basketball, and volleyball for the guests. Guests and alumni repeatedly praised the university students of New China: not only are their academic achievements very good, but they are also sports experts.

    清华大学师生欢度四十三周年校庆
    四月四日，清华大学师生欢乐地度过了四十三周年校庆。这一天他们招待了前来参加校庆的清华大学校友和产业部门机关工作人员二万多人。
    中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡，重工业部部长王鹤寿，第一机械工业部副部长段君毅，燃料工业部副部长李范一、徐达本，铁道部副部长石志仁，中国科学院近代物理研究所所长钱三强，清华大学的老校友、科学家高士其等都到校祝贺。五日继续到校的来宾有中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章，第一机械工业部部长黄敬、副部长汪道涵，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部副主任萧华，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记罗毅、区棠亮、章泽等。
    来宾中还有二百多位国际友人。
    四日，清华大学七个系的实验室和展览室全部开放。每个系的展览室里从早到晚拥挤着参观的人群。建筑系的展览室引起了来宾们最大的兴趣，这里展出了未来的青年建筑师们——建筑系的学生所创制的住宅、学校、休养所、大剧院等各种样式优美、色彩鲜艳的图样。土木工程馆门前一座正在升降的塔式起重机模型吸引了成千的观众，实验室里还有占地十平方公尺的康藏公路二郎山山区的模型。在水利馆旁边的一个混凝土的水槽上，有人正驾驶着一个小型的电车，那是水利系设置的流速仪校正站。在我国高等学校里第一次出现的水利枢纽工程就要完工了。讲解员指着水坝对大家说：这座水坝完工以后能供应十到十五瓩的电力，可供水工结构专业的教师和学生进行实习和科学研究。动力机械系展出的供气轮、发电机循环水冷却用的冷却池，像喷水池似的飞溅着水花。展览中还有最近建立的二十二万伏超高压输电线路的铁塔模型。无线电系展览了从发送机到接受机的整个过程，表演声波怎样利用无线电波传播到远处，装真空系统和电子管制造程序。各系还用图片和各种实物介绍了教师们怎样努力学习苏联进行教学改革，以及如何培养学生成为全面发展的人材。
    在参观的同时，座谈会和联欢会开始了。机械制造系的校友、模范共产党员林宗棠向四百多学生作了参加工作以后的体会的报告。土木工程系公路专业的学生和中央人民政府交通部公路总局的工作人员们欢聚在科学馆里，亲切地交谈了工作和学习的情况。一年级学生们还兴奋地唱起了勘探队之歌。特从天津赶来的天津大学水力学教研组全体教师参观以后还和清华大学水利系的教师举行座谈，交换了教学工作的经验。其他各系师生也和校友们、产业部门的来宾座谈，他们希望今后加强联系，使理论和实践更紧密地结合起来。
    来宾中的国际友人多是各高等学校和产业部门的苏联专家。一位苏联专家参观了各系的展览以后，对招待的同志说：在您的引导下，我非常有趣地看到了中国大学的教学工作，这里的人们是如何地爱好科学、尊重科学啊！
    下午，清华大学的运动员们和其他高等学校的运动员还为来宾们表演了足球、篮球、排球等友谊比赛。来宾和校友们不止一次地赞叹着新中国的大学生：不仅学习成绩很好，也是体育运动的能手。
