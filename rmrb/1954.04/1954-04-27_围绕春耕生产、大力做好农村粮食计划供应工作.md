    Focus on Spring Plowing and Production, Vigorously Implement Rural Grain Planned Supply Work
    Zhou Kangmin
    After the planned grain purchase work in rural areas is completed, doing a good job in the planned grain supply work and effectively solving the grain needs of grain-deficient farmers is one of the main tasks of rural work. It is of great significance for improving farmers' production enthusiasm, promoting agricultural production increase, strengthening the ties between the Party and the government and the people, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. At present, in the vast rural areas, the progress and development of grain planned supply work in most areas are normal and healthy, and it has won the enthusiastic support and endorsement of the vast number of farmers. Farmers generally reflect: "If the government hadn't implemented unified purchase and sales, there wouldn't be such stable grain prices in the spring," "Planned supply is good, every household has grain to eat, the government is thinking about the people everywhere." In these areas, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers and their enthusiasm for participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement have also increased.
    However, in a few places, the planned grain supply work is not done well. Either the supply quantity is insufficient, or the supply is not timely, or the restrictions are too strict, etc., so that the food ration problem of grain-deficient households in rural areas cannot be resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. In some places, the work of organizing farmers to adjust grain themselves and exchange varieties for the part of surplus grain still remaining in rural areas after the unified grain purchase has not been given sufficient attention. In addition, in a few places, attention has not been paid to the appropriate supply of grain necessary for cooked food industries, flour mills, and mule and horse inns in towns and villages.
    The main reason why the grain supply work is not done well in a few rural areas is that some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance and arduousness of the rural grain planned supply. They believe that "unified sales are easier than unified purchases," or there is a "rather tight than loose" mentality. Therefore, they have not carried out sufficient organizational and mobilization work for the rural grain supply after the unified grain purchase. On the other hand, it is also because some farmers lack a correct understanding of the state's grain supply policy and adopted the method of "reporting non-shortages as shortages, and reporting small shortages as large shortages" when buying grain from the state, buying more grain. However, the cadres responsible for the grain supply departments did not explain these farmers' ideas, but were worried that the numbers reported by the masses were too large and that they would break the planned targets. They did not dare to boldly publicize the state's grain supply policy: "Truly grain-deficient households can buy the grain they need." These also increased the difficulty of grain supply in these areas. If this kind of thinking and practice of not paying attention to doing a good job in grain supply work is not corrected, it will cause difficulties for future grain planned purchase and planned supply work.
    At present, it is the spring shortage period, and it is particularly important to further improve the planned grain supply work in rural areas. Therefore, state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must seize the opportunity, focus on the central task of spring plowing and production, and conscientiously do a good job in grain supply work. According to the experience of various places, in order to further improve the rural grain planned supply work, attention must be paid to mastering the following working links.
    First, the main key to rural grain planned supply work should first be to solve the grain supply for grain-deficient households in a timely manner. If the original planned supply control target figures in some places are no longer in line with the actual situation, the spirit of seeking truth from facts should be upheld. On the principle of ensuring supply to truly grain-deficient households, those with surpluses should be transferred upwards, and those with shortages should put forward opinions on increasing the figures, and report them to the higher authorities for adjustment. In the setting of supply points, it should be closely combined with the supply and marketing cooperatives, so that it can take into account the grain buying habits of the masses, reasonable circulation to facilitate the masses to buy grain, but also take into account the management of administrative divisions and reduce operating costs. In terms of grain supply methods, it should be combined with spring production work, and according to the general control figures, adopt the method of democratic appraisal to quickly determine the grain shortage quantity of grain-deficient households, issue grain purchase certificates, and designate supply locations. It can be purchased in installments or in one lump sum. In places where grain purchase certificates have already been issued through democratic appraisal, if the quantity appraised for grain-deficient households is insufficient or truly grain-deficient households have not been appraised for supply quantity, they can apply for inspection and adjustment. For some farmers who are not truly grain-deficient, patient explanation and persuasion work must be carried out. Of course, those who deliberately buy more and hoard for speculation should be banned. In short, in order to do a good job in rural grain planned supply work, it is necessary to seek truth from facts, and both prevent the tendency of being too restrictive and complicated procedures, and of deviating from the masses, and prevent the tendency of blindly expanding the supply indefinitely without considering the objects.
    Second, after the end of the planned grain purchase, ordinary rural areas still have different amounts of surplus grain to be sold. The grain companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should pay attention to purchasing these surplus grains in order to adjust the rural supply. For towns and villages, state-owned grain markets should be set up according to the different economic conditions and historical habits of various places. Under the strict supervision and management of the state, farmers and consumers can conduct their own adjustments and variety exchanges. Transaction procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and education of trading personnel should be strengthened. For small amount adjustments and exchanges between varieties in rural areas, as long as they are not sold to grain merchants and speculators, hoarding for speculation, do not interfere, and adjustments can be made within the mutual aid group. Doing a good job in grain adjustment in rural areas can not only solve the grain problem for grain-deficient households, but also reduce the state's supply burden, and also plays a major role in enlivening the rural economy.
    Third, industries such as cooked food, flour mills, and mule and horse inns in towns and villages have a great impact on enlivening the primary market and facilitating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Appropriate grain should also be supplied for these industries. In places where state-owned grain markets have been established, the supply method can be based on the supply and demand situation of the amount of grain on the market, and with approval, they can be allowed to purchase a portion from the market under control; the state can also supply a portion. These industries must be subjected to frequent supervision and inspection to prevent them from speculating and hoarding.
    Fourth, at present, it is the peak season for grain sales in rural areas when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available. In order to ensure the necessary grain supply for grain-deficient households, grain transfer work must also be done well. The inventory strength should be checked and studied and calculated in a timely manner. For problems existing in grain types, regions, and transfers, specific measures and methods should be formulated according to the purchase and sale plans, processing, storage, and other conditions, and the strength should be carefully and appropriately deployed to complete the transfer task on time. For the grain needed in economic crop areas and disaster areas, it should be transferred first. In the process of transfer, the transfer situation should be effectively grasped and studied, the accuracy of the plan should be strengthened, attention should be paid to grasping reasonable transportation routes, avoiding circuitous and opposing transportation, saving the state's transportation strength, and reducing commodity circulation costs, which is of great significance to the country's economic construction.
    Under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, as long as state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives closely rely on the masses and correctly implement policies, they will certainly be able to do a good job in rural grain planned supply work and achieve a comprehensive victory on the grain front.

    围绕春耕生产、大力做好农村粮食计划供应工作
    周康民
    农村中的粮食计划收购工作结束后，做好粮食计划供应工作，切实地解决缺粮农民需要的粮食是农村工作主要任务之一，它对提高农民生产积极性，促进农业增产，密切党和政府与人民的联系和巩固工农联盟有重要的意义。目前广大农村中，大部分地区的粮食计划供应工作的进行和发展是正常的，健康的，获得了广大农民热情的支持和拥护。农民普遍反映：“不是政府实行统购统销，春天那有这样稳的粮价”，“计划供应好，家家有粮吃，政府处处替老百姓打算”。这些地区广大农民的生产积极性和参加互助合作运动的热情也随之高涨。
    但有少数地方，粮食计划供应工作做得不好。不是供应数量不足，就是供应不及时，或限制过严等等，使农村中缺粮户的口粮问题不能得到及时地妥善地解决。有些地方，对粮食统购后农村还留有的部分余粮，组织农民对粮食自行调剂和品种交换的工作还未予以充分注意。还有少数地方，对集镇与农村中的熟食业、粉坊和骡马客店等所必需的粮食，没有注意适当供应。
    少数农村中粮食供应工作做得不好的主要原因，是由于某些干部，对农村粮食计划供应的重要性和艰巨性认识不足，认为：“统销比统购容易”，或者存在“宁紧勿松”的思想，因而对粮食统购后的农村粮食供应，没有进行充分的组织工作和动员工作。另方面，也由于一部分农民，对国家粮食供应政策缺乏正确的认识，在向国家买粮食时，采取了“不缺报缺，缺少报多”的办法，多购粮食；而负责粮食供应部门的干部，却不针对这些农民的思想进行解释，反而顾虑群众自报数字太大和怕突破计划指标，不敢大胆宣传国家的粮食供应政策：“真正缺粮户能够买到所需要的粮食”，这些也增加了这些地区粮食供应的困难。这种不重视做好粮食供应工作的思想和做法，如不加以纠正，会给今后的粮食计划收购与计划供应工作造成困难。
    目前正是春季缺粮时期，进一步做好农村中的粮食计划供应工作，显得特别重要。所以各地国营粮食部门和供销合作社必须抓紧时机，围绕春耕生产这一中心任务，认真地做好粮食供应工作。根据各地经验，要进一步做好农村粮食计划供应工作，必须注意掌握以下几个工作环节。
    第一、农村粮食计划供应工作的主要关键，首先应及时地解决缺粮户的粮食供应。有些地方原计划的供应控制指标数字，在目前已不符合实际情况的，应本实事求是的精神，在保证对真正缺粮户的供应的原则下，有余的上调，不足的提出增加数字的意见，报请上级予以调整。在供应点的设置上，应与供销合作社密切结合，既要照顾群众购粮习惯，合理流转，以便利群众购买，又要照顾到行政区划的管理和降低经营费用。在粮食供应方法上，应结合春季生产工作，根据大体的控制数字，采取民主评议的方式，迅速把缺粮户的缺粮数量确定下来，发购粮证，指定供应地点，可以分期购买或一次购买。在已经民主评议发了购粮证的地方，对缺粮户如所评数量不足或真正缺粮户未评上供应数量，可由本人申请，予以检查调整。对于有些非真正缺粮的农民，须进行耐心的解释和教育说服工作。对于故意多购、囤积居奇者，当然应该予以取缔。总之，为要做好农村粮食计划供应工作，必须实事求是，既要防止限制过严、手续繁杂的脱离群众的偏向，又要防止不看对象，无限制地盲目扩大供应的偏向。
    第二、粮食计划收购结束后，一般农村还有不同数量的余粮需要出售，对这些余粮，粮食公司和供销合作社应注意收购，以调剂农村供应。对集镇应根据各地不同经济情况和历史习惯，设立国家粮食市场，在国家严格监督与管理下，使农民与消费者自行进行调剂和品种交换，成交手续要力求简单化，并加强对交易人员的教育。对于在农村中彼此间以有易无的少量调剂及品种间的交换，只要不是卖给粮商粮贩，囤积投机，就不要干涉，并可在互助组内进行调剂。做好农村粮食的调剂工作，既可解决缺粮户的粮食问题，又可减轻国家供应负担，对活跃农村经济也起了重大的作用。
    第三、集镇与农村中的熟食业、粉坊、骡马客店等行业，对活跃初级市场，便利城乡物资交流有很大影响，这些行业所需粮食亦应适当供应。已建立国家粮食市场的地方，供应的方法可根据粮食上市数量供求情况，经批准有控制地允许其到市场购买一部分；国家也可以供应一部分。对这些行业必须加以经常的监督和检查，以防止其投机和囤积。
    第四、目前正是农村青黄不接粮食销售旺季，为保证对缺粮户必需的粮食供应，还必须做好粮食调运工作。应及时检查与研究计算库存力量，对粮种间、地区间、调运上存在的问题，应根据购销计划、加工、保管等情况，拟订具体措施和办法，将力量予以周密地适当地布置，抓紧按时完成调运任务。对于经济作物区、灾区所需粮食，应先调运。在调运过程中，应切实掌握与研究调运情况，加强计划的准确性，注意掌握合理的运输路线，避免迂回和相向的运输，节约国家运输力量，降低商品流通费用，这对国家经济建设有重大的意义。
    在各级党政机关领导下，国营粮食部门和供销合作社只要密切地依靠群众，正确地贯彻政策，就一定能把农村粮食计划供应工作做好，在粮食战线上取得全面的胜利。
