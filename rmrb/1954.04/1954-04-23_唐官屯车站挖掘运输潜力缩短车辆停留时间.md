Tangguantun Station, Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau, has shortened vehicle turnaround time and unleashed the latent power of transportation. In the first quarter of this year, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau stipulated that the target for Tangguantun Station was an average vehicle turnaround time of eleven hours. Tangguantun Station only used 4.2 hours, excellently completing this target. On average, each vehicle spent 6.8 hours less time at the station. In early April, Tangguantun Station further reduced the turnaround time to only 2.2 hours per vehicle. With reduced turnaround time, vehicles can reach other stations faster to load and unload goods, greatly enhancing transportation capacity.

At the end of last year, Tangguantun Station, under the leadership of duty stationmaster Dong Jiabin, after setting a record of over 700 days without accidents, put forward the slogan "Shorten vehicle turnaround time and enhance transportation capacity." They adopted Soviet experience—the non-detachment operation method—to save time and quickly load and unload goods, preventing vehicles from remaining at the station. Originally, regulations stipulated that vehicles to be unloaded or loaded at the station had to be detached. Now, the Tangguantun Station loading and unloading workers unload the goods without detaching the vehicles. This way, the vehicles no longer stay at the station. In the first quarter of this year, workers used this advanced method to unload 277 vehicles.

The employees of Tangguantun Station also actively utilize transportation capacity to shorten vehicle turnaround time. Once, they loaded a vehicle with goods and waited for a locomotive to pull it away. After waiting for a long time, no locomotive arrived. They heard that a locomotive that was not pulling any vehicles was about to pass through Tangguantun Station. They immediately obtained the approval of the dispatching office and had this locomotive pull the loaded vehicle away. Duty stationmaster Dong Jiabin once proactively sought potential improvements, changing the location of vehicle parking, allowing the locomotive to avoid detours at the station and saving twenty minutes. He also fully utilized the capacity of the tracks, once accommodating an extra train.

In early April this year, Tangguantun Station set a new record of 800 days without accidents. They are determined to further shorten vehicle turnaround time under the condition of safe driving in order to speed up vehicle turnover.

    唐官屯车站挖掘运输潜力缩短车辆停留时间
    天津铁路分局唐官屯车站，缩短了车辆的停留时间，发挥了运输的潜在力量。今年第一季度，天津铁路分局规定唐官屯车站的指标是：每辆车平均在车站停留十一小时。唐官屯车站只用了四点二小时，就出色地完成了这个指标。平均每辆车少停留了六点八小时。四月上旬，唐官屯车站又缩短了停留时间，每辆车只停留了二点二小时。停留时间减少了，车辆就可以更快地到别的车站去装运货物，大大增强了运输力量。
    去年年底，唐官屯车站在值班站长董家彬的领导下，创造了七百多天无事故的纪录以后，提出了“缩短车辆停留时间，增强运输力量”的口号。他们采用苏联经验—不摘车作业法，争取时间，迅速地装货、卸货，使得车辆不停留在车站里。原来规定：在车站上要卸货或装货的车辆，都要甩下来。现在唐官屯车站装卸工人不让车辆甩下来，就把货物卸空了。这样，车辆就不再在车站停留了。今年第一季度，工人们采用这个先进方法，卸了二百七十七车。
    唐官屯车站职工还主动地利用运输能力，来缩短车辆停留时间。有一次，他们装好了一辆车货物，等候机车来拉。等了好半天，还没有机车来。他们听说一台不拉车的机车将要经过唐官屯车站，他们马上征得调度所同意，由这台不拉车的机车把那辆装好货物的车拉走。值班站长董家彬曾经主动地找潜力，改变车辆停放的地方，让机车在车站不绕道，少走了二十分钟时间。他还充分利用股道的能力，曾经多接了一列车。
    今年四月初，唐官屯车站又创造了八百天无事故的纪录。他们决心在安全行车的条件下，进一步缩短车辆停留时间，以便加快车辆的运转。
