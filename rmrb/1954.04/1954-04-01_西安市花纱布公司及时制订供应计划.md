    Xi'an Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company Promptly Formulates Supply Plan
    The Xi'an Municipal Company of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation mobilized all its employees to conscientiously discuss and formulate the commodity circulation plan for the second quarter. They first reviewed the commodity supply situation in the second quarter of last year, studied the needs of urban areas, rural areas, and industrial and mining construction, and the sales patterns of major commodities. Because the urban industrial and mining population has increased this year, and the purchasing power of farmers has generally increased, the sales plan for the second quarter has been expanded compared to the same period last year. At the same time, careful consideration was given to the commodities needed in rural areas. For example, after studying the supply situation of striped cloth and multi-colored serge, an additional 18,000 bolts were added to expand the supply of striped cloth. The cotton cloth sales plan for the second quarter of this year increased by 42.86 percent compared to the same period last year.
    In organizing the supply of goods, in addition to organizing processing and timely allocation in Xi'an and ordering from supply stations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places, for commodities that were in short supply and could not be allocated in time, internal adjustment and exchange methods were adopted to solve the problem of supply and commodity availability. For example, 190 Indanthrene blue cloth is a hot-selling item in Shaanxi, but Gansu has a large inventory, so the Gansu Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company transferred a portion to the Xi'an Municipal Company. The Xi'an Municipal Company then organized a batch of various colors of Yonggu (Everlasting) gabardine, preparing to supply the needs of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai. The company also transferred summer commodities such as printed cloth, poplin, and printed linen yarn in advance, greatly enriching the supply of goods to ensure timely supply of commodities.

    西安市花纱布公司及时制订供应计划
    中国花纱布公司西安市公司，发动全体职工认真讨论制订第二季度的商品流转计划。他们首先检查了去年第二季度商品供应情况，研究了城市、农村与工矿建设的需要和主要商品的销售规律，由于今年城市工矿区人口增加，农民购买力一般有所提高，所以第二季度销售计划比去年同期扩大了。同时对农村需要的商品，也作了周密的考虑，如条格布、杂色哔叽，经过研究货源情况以后，又追加了一万八千匹，扩大了条布的供应。今年第二季度的棉布销售计划比去年同期增加了百分之四十二点八六。
    在组织货源时，除在西安组织加工及时调拨和向上海、天津、青岛等地供应站订货外，对于供应不足而又不能及时调拨来的商品，采取了内部调剂和交换的方法，解决货源和供应问题。如一九○阴丹士林布在陕西是热销货，但甘肃库存却很大，因此甘肃省花纱布公司调给西安市公司一部分。西安市公司则组织了一批各种颜色的永固呢，准备供应新疆、甘肃、青海少数民族的需要。该公司还提前调拨了花布、府绸、花麻纱等夏令商品，大大充实了货源，以保证商品的及时供应。
