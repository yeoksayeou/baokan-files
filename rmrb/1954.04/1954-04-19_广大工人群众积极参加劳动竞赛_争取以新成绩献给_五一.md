The broad masses of workers are actively participating in labor competitions to strive for new achievements to dedicate to "May Day".

    The Competition in Yumen Oil Mine Promotes Production
    Crude Oil, Gasoline, and Kerosene Production Exceeds Plan
    All employees of the Yumen Oil Mine are carrying out a production competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day. The drilling teams in the drilling system have proposed to strive for new records based on the current well depths: 750 meters, 300 meters, 250 meters, and 200 meters for deep exploration wells, respectively, to greet "May Day." Employees in the oil extraction system have proposed to extract 11.8% more crude oil in April than in March while maintaining a certain ratio of natural gas and crude oil. Employees in the oil refining system have proposed to complete the production of various fuels according to the plan, improve the oil refining rate to reduce crude oil consumption, and store hundreds of tons of oil residue. All employees engaged in basic construction projects in the mining area and more than 3,000 migrant workers have expressed their intention to welcome "May Day" with practical actions to accelerate the construction of the mining area.
    During the competition, the production of many production units is very good. As of April 11, daily production plans have been completed or exceeded. On April 11, crude oil production exceeded the plan by 0.84%, gasoline production exceeded the plan by 1.14%, and kerosene production exceeded the plan by 2.17%.

    Employees of Shanghai Refinery Set Competition Targets
    Guarantee the Completion of Expansion Project Quickly and Well
    All employees of the state-owned Shanghai Refinery, which is under expansion, are enthusiastically launching a labor competition to welcome "May Day" Labor Day, ensuring the completion of the factory's expansion project quickly and well.
    On the construction site, since the April construction operation plan arrived at the construction teams, each team has discussed the key issues in the construction, set competition targets for the team, found many ways to complete the targets, and launched a competition. The Xuan Hanwen team, responsible for installing pipes, has carefully studied and set a plan for the following week every week, reviewing the cutting of materials to prevent errors and ensure quality. They are now confident of completing the team plan two days ahead of schedule. The Ma Xinyong team, which installs insulation pipes, can also complete the plan three days ahead of schedule due to the formulation of a weekly plan and the adoption of a parallel operation method. As for the bending pipe team, they have exceeded the plan by 50% every day in the past few days. The machine workshop and assembly workshop, focusing on supporting the construction site, have set competition targets. The machine workshop has established a contact contract with the construction site to ensure the supply of more than 1,000 accessories to the construction site every week. The first week has been completed on schedule, eliminating the phenomenon of supply disconnection. In addition, various departments have also launched competitions.

    Workers of Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory Set Competition Conditions
    Actively Improve Production Technology and Labor Organization
    In order to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day, dozens of production teams in the state-owned Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory have set competition conditions to complete the April production tasks three to seven days ahead of schedule. In the first ten days of April, workers have put forward 150 rationalization proposals. The first team of the punching and shearing section of the electric motor workshop had completed 49% of the entire month's workload by April 10. The red line representing production performance on the personal competition chart of the switch workshop is rising rapidly. On April 10, Liu Guanghan, an old worker in the fitter team, completed the workload equivalent to 18.5 man-hours in 7.5 man-hours. Wang Shigui and Wang Xiusong, workers in the screw team, started working on April 25 on April 11.
    In the competition, the workers actively improved production technology and labor organization by taking Wang Chonglun, a production innovator, as an example. After Luo Wenbo, a young lathe operator in the transformer workshop, changed from single-handed operation to double-handed operation, he can complete three days' tasks every day. After the first team of the tool workshop improved labor organization and operation methods, the production efficiency increased by 50% compared with March. As of April 10, they had completed 45% of the entire month's plan.

    Employees of Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory
    Strive to Better Complete the April Task
    Labor competitions have been widely launched in various workshops of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. Workers have expressed their intention to greet their festival with new achievements in production. Since the locomotive workshop launched the competition to complete the daily work plan, it has now achieved balanced production, and has completed the task of overhauling six locomotives in early April. The employees of the boiler workshop saw that the efficiency of the pneumatic drill for disassembling screw stays in their workshop was not high, which affected the completion of the task. They took the initiative to find ways to use waste materials to create a universal drill stay disassembly device, shortening the number of days of locomotive overhaul in the factory. Employees of the freight car workshop put forward a series of methods to improve production preparation, such as strengthening the labor organization of the dismantling team, equipping leadership to decompose, inspect and order parts in a timely manner; strictly mastering the progress plan and establishing a team leader assignment system to "assign tomorrow's work today" so that everyone has a clear understanding. After Ming Jingxian, a worker in the workshop, implemented this system, he once completed 450% of the quota in one day. The Li Mingshun team of the mechanical workshop also expressed that they would deeply promote the Kovalev work method, etc., and study the comprehensive application of the Unanov universal lathe tool method, striving to complete the April production task ten days ahead of schedule on the basis of executing the daily progress plan and ensuring 100% quality.

    Baoding Twenty-three Local State-owned Factories
    Tap Potential to Improve Labor Productivity
    The broad masses of employees of twenty-three local state-owned factories in Baoding City, Hebei Province, such as the power plant, machinery manufacturing factory, textile factory, and cotton oil factory, are actively welcoming "May Day" International Labor Day, formulating plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and continuing to deepen the labor competition. According to preliminary statistics, the factories will increase production and save (output value) 49.1 billion yuan for the country throughout the year, exceeding the financial task by 10.9 billion yuan.
    When formulating plans, all factories paid attention to tapping the potential of enterprises, maximizing the improvement of labor productivity, and further formulated technical and organizational measures. According to statistics from thirteen factories, 71 measures have been formulated; calculated according to 58 measures that can calculate the effect, more than 20.1 billion yuan can be increased in production and saved throughout the year. All factories also paid attention to reducing raw material consumption, strengthening waste utilization, and increasing by-product income. Now, on the basis of promoting advanced experience, the factories have begun to break through new production quotas. The Shuimen workshop of the Baoding Machinery Manufacturing Factory used to be the weakest production unit, and now most workers can complete the production plan on a daily basis.
