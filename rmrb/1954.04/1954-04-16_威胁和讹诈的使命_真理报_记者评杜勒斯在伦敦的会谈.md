Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th: "Pravda" published an article by its London correspondent, Orekhov, commenting on Dulles' talks in London. The article is titled "Mission of Threats and Blackmail."

Orekhov wrote that US Secretary of State Dulles concluded his two days of talks with the British government in London on April 13th. What did Dulles talk about in London, and what was the reason for his sudden arrival in London? Orekhov answers this question by saying that Washington fears that the Geneva Conference, scheduled to open on April 26th, will promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and an end to the Indochina War, which France, with US assistance, has been waging against the Vietnamese people for seven years. Obviously, ending this war is not in the plans of the US ruling clique.

Orekhov said that not long ago, Dulles, in a speech in Washington, demanded that Britain, France, and the United States jointly issue a statement accusing the People's Republic of China of "interfering in the Indochina War," and demanded that they use provocative threats of so-called "united action" in Asia.

After demanding "united action," the US Senate threatened that if Britain and France did not agree to the demand for "united action," they would lose US aid.

Orekhov said that Dulles' demand for "united action" and the threats issued by the US Senate aroused indignation in Britain. Newspapers openly talked about contradictions between Western allies. This is the reason Dulles went to London; he went to resolve the aforementioned contradictions.

Orekhov continued, Dulles himself said that the mission of his trip to London was to seek peace through strength. However, it turns out that Dulles' mission has nothing in common with the cause of peace. The United States is once again attempting to apply its infamous "position of strength" and blackmail policy—this time targeting Britain. On April 12th, as soon as Dulles began talks with Eden, newspapers reported that the United States was again issuing new threats, saying that if Britain did not agree to the US demand for so-called "united action" against the people of East Asia and Southeast Asia, the United States would stop aid to Britain.

Orekhov discussed the results of the London talks, pointing out that after Dulles' talks with Eden ended, they issued a joint communiqué. From the communiqué, it can be seen that Dulles brought to London a plan to establish a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific similar to the North Atlantic Alliance. According to the US plan, this military alliance should include the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and others. The communiqué also shows that Britain has agreed to discuss the issue of such a military alliance with other relevant countries.

Orekhov pointed out that Britain had long wanted to participate in a Pacific organization modeled on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pieced together by the United States, but each time it was rejected by the United States. It seems that the United States has now determined that the appropriate time has arrived and that concessions should be made in this regard to exchange for Britain's agreement to participate in a conspiracy to use blackmail in international relations on the eve of the Geneva Conference.

At the same time, it is pointed out here that Dulles has been forced to abandon his original proposition and withdraw his request to immediately issue a joint statement on so-called "united action" in the Far East.

From newspaper comments, it can be seen that Britain's opposition to immediately issuing such a joint statement is due to various serious considerations.

Orekhov concluded by saying: It should not be forgotten that the British people, the hundreds of millions of people in Asia, and the people of all countries in the world, place their hopes on the Geneva Conference for the final establishment of peace in Korea and the end of the Indochina War.

    威胁和讹诈的使命
    ——“真理报”记者评杜勒斯在伦敦的会谈
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“真理报”发表了驻伦敦记者奥列霍夫的一篇文章，评论杜勒斯在伦敦的会谈，这篇文章的题目是“威胁和讹诈的使命”。
    奥列霍夫写道，美国国务卿杜勒斯于四月十三日结束了他在伦敦和英国政府举行了两天的会谈。杜勒斯在伦敦谈的是什么，他突然到达伦敦的原因又是什么呢？奥列霍夫回答这个问题说：华盛顿害怕定于四月二十六日开会的日内瓦会议会促成朝鲜问题的和平解决，促成法国在美国帮助下迄今已对越南人民进行了七年的印度支那战争的结束。显然，结束这场战争是不在美国统治集团的计划中的。
    奥列霍夫说：不久以前，杜勒斯在华盛顿发表演说时要求英法和美国共同发表声明，指责中华人民共和国“干涉印度支那战争”，要求它们使用在亚洲采取所谓“联合行动”的挑衅性的威胁手段。
    在要求采取“联合行动”后，美国参议院威胁说，如果英国和法国不同意采取“联合行动”的要求，它们就将失去美国的援助。
    奥列霍夫说，杜勒斯的采取“联合行动”的要求以及美国参议院发出的威胁引起了英国的愤慨。报纸公开谈到西方盟国间的矛盾。这就是杜勒斯到伦敦的原因，他就是为了解决上述矛盾而去的。
    奥列霍夫接着说，杜勒斯自己说他的伦敦之行的使命是以实力来谋取和平。然而事实证明，杜勒斯的使命与和平事业毫无共同之处。美国又一次企图应用它的臭名远扬的“实力地位”和讹诈的政策——这一次的对象是英国。四月十二日，杜勒斯刚一开始和艾登会谈，报纸就报道美国又在发出新的威胁说，如果英国不同意美国的对东亚和东南亚人民采取所谓“联合行动”的要求，美国就要停止对英国的援助。
    奥列霍夫谈到伦敦会谈的结果，他指出：在杜勒斯与艾登会谈结束以后，他们发表了联合公报，从公报中可以看出，杜勒斯把规定在东南亚和太平洋西部建立一个和北大西洋联盟相似的军事联盟的计划带到伦敦去了。依照美国的计划，这种军事联盟应当包括美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾与泰国等。公报又表明，英国已同意与其他有关国家讨论这样一种军事联盟的问题。
    奥列霍夫指出：英国早就想参加由美国拼凑的仿照北大西洋公约组织的太平洋组织，但是每次都被美国拒绝。看来美国现在已经断定适当的时机已经到来，应该在这方面实行让步来换取英国同意参加在日内瓦会议前夕在国际关系中利用讹诈手段的阴谋。
    同时，此间指出，杜勒斯已经被迫放弃原来的主张，撤销了他的要求立即发表一个关于在远东采取所谓“联合行动”的联合声明的建议。
    从报纸的评论可以看出，英国反对立刻发表这样一种联合声明，是由于种种认真的考虑。
    奥列霍夫最后说：不应该忘记，英国人民、亚洲的千百万人民以及世界各国的人民，都把在朝鲜最后建立和平以及结束印度支那战争的希望寄托在日内瓦会议上。
