The Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government
Convened a National Conference on Relief Work for Unemployed Workers

The National Conference on Relief Work for Unemployed Workers recently convened by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government summarized the unemployment relief work of the past four years and further clarified the guiding principles for handling unemployment work in the future.

The meeting held that the achievements in handling unemployment work over the past four years have been significant. This is not only reflected in the timely adoption of methods such as work-for-relief, vocational training, provision of relief, and production for self-salvation to assist a portion of the unemployed, alleviating their living hardships and improving the employment conditions of some of the unemployed, but also in introducing a large number of unemployed people to re-employment, thereby greatly alleviating the severe unemployment phenomenon left over from the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, along with the restoration and development of the national economy. The meeting pointed out that there were also some shortcomings in the past unemployment relief work, such as insufficient attention to production interests in job placement and vocational training, a conciliatory attitude in relief work, and excessively rigid restrictions on labor allocation. These shortcomings have had a certain impact on industrial production and national construction, while also limiting the convenience of employing people in public and private enterprises, narrowing the channels for the unemployed to find jobs on their own, and wasting relief funds. After discussion, the meeting further clarified the understanding that job placement and vocational training must proceed from production and be subordinate to the interests of national construction; relief work must be appropriate and timely under the principle of thrift.

Regarding the guiding principles for labor employment work in the future, the meeting conducted a more detailed discussion. The meeting held that due to the start of the country's first Five-Year Plan, which has driven the development of various economic undertakings, the demand for labor has increased sharply, making it possible for unemployed people who lack the conditions to participate in factory and mining enterprise production to find jobs and means of self-support in other various economic undertakings. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to educate the unemployed to fully exert their initiative in "thinking of ways themselves" and correct the idea of simply relying on the government. The meeting decided that the guiding principles for labor employment work in the future are: in addition to gradually introducing employment based on the needs of national construction, economic development, and the employment conditions of the unemployed, it is also necessary to encourage the unemployed to find jobs and means of self-support on their own; appropriately narrow the scope of unified allocation to expand channels for self-employment. Secondly, necessary technical training should be provided to unemployed youths who have real potential for cultivation, based on production needs. Unemployed people who cannot find jobs and have real difficulties in life should be given appropriate relief according to their individual circumstances.

Finally, the meeting emphasized that the implementation of the above-mentioned guiding principles should be combined with extensive and in-depth propaganda among the unemployed regarding the country's general task during the transition period, so that the unemployed realize that the combination of job placement and self-employment is completely correct under the conditions that the country has begun large-scale economic construction, which is beneficial to the country's production and also of great benefit to the unemployed.

    中央人民政府劳动部
    召开全国失业工人救济工作会议
    中央人民政府劳动部最近召开的全国失业工人救济工作会议，总结了四年来的失业救济工作，并且进一步明确了今后处理失业工作的方针。
    会议认为四年来在处理失业工作上的成绩是很大的。这不但表现在及时地采取以工代赈、转业训练、发放救济、生产自救等方式救济了一部分失业人员，减轻了他们的生活痛苦和提高了一部分失业人员的就业条件，而且还介绍了大批的失业人员重新就业，从而使帝国主义和国民党反动统治遗留下来的严重失业现象，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，到目前有了很大程度的减轻。会议指出：过去在失业工人救济工作中也存在着一些缺点，如介绍就业、转业训练工作上注意生产利益不够，救济工作上有迁就情绪，劳动力调配方面限制得过死过严等。这些缺点，对工业生产和国家建设都起了一定的影响，同时也限制了公私营企业的用人方便，缩小了失业人员的自动就业门路，浪费了救济经费。会议经过讨论，进一步明确认识到介绍就业和转业训练必须从生产出发，服从国家建设利益；在救济工作上必须在节约的原则下做到得当和及时。
    对于今后劳动就业工作的方针问题，会议着重地进行了比较详细讨论。会议认为：由于国家第一个五年计划的开始，带动了各种经济事业的发展，劳动力的需要激剧增加，使缺乏参加厂矿企业生产条件的失业人员，在其他各种经济事业中找到职业和自谋生活出路有了可能。因此，今后必须要教育失业人员充分发挥“自己想办法”的积极性，纠正单纯依赖政府的思想。会议决定今后劳动就业工作的方针是：除根据国家建设，经济发展的需要和失业人员的就业条件逐步介绍就业外，并要鼓励失业人员自找工作自谋生活出路； 适当地缩小统一调配的范围，以扩大自行就业的门路。其次，对确有培养前途的失业青年应根据生产需要，给以必要的技术训练。无法找到职业、生活确实困难的失业人员，应分别情况给以适当救济。
    最后，会议强调指出：上述方针的贯彻执行，应该结合国家在过渡时期的总任务在失业人员中进行广泛深入的宣传，使失业人员认识到介绍就业和自行就业相结合的方针，在国家已经开始大规模经济建设的条件下是完全正确的，对国家的生产有利，对失业人员也有很大的好处。（新华社）
