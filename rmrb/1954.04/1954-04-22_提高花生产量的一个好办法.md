    A Good Way to Increase Peanut Production
    General Bureau of Agricultural Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    Using peanut rhizobium inoculant is the most economical, simple, and effective way to increase peanut yield per unit area. Peanuts are one of China's main oil crops. Peanut kernels have a high oil content, and the by-product of oil extraction, oil cake, is rich in protein and very suitable for feed. Because of the great economic value of this crop, taking effective measures to increase its yield per unit area is a work of great significance.
    Peanuts are leguminous plants, and their roots have many small nodules. Inside the nodules are millions of microorganisms, which are rhizobia. Rhizobia and peanuts have a symbiotic relationship. They can absorb and fix free nitrogen from the air, turning it into nitrogen-containing compounds that peanuts can directly absorb and utilize, helping peanuts grow and develop. Peanut rhizobium inoculant can be produced artificially. Currently, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry are all manufacturing peanut rhizobium inoculant. When peanuts are flowering, selecting plants that are growing vigorously and have large and numerous nodules, digging them up with their roots, removing the leaves, and hanging them in a shady place to dry (they should be stored in a dark, damp, and unventilated place) can also be used as inoculant.
    The method of using peanut rhizobium inoculant is very simple. When sowing peanuts, put three to five qian of rhizobium inoculant in a bowl, add half a jin of water and mix thoroughly, then pour it on fifteen to twenty jin of peanut seeds (shelled) and stir evenly so that each seed is coated with rhizobium inoculant (when using rhizobia saved by farmers themselves, the rhizobia can be picked, ground, and mixed with water before mixing with the seeds, about twenty peanut plants with nodules are needed to mix the seeds for one mu of land). During the mixing process, do not expose the rhizobia to direct sunlight. It is best to sow the mixed seeds immediately to prevent the rhizobium inoculant attached to the seeds from drying out and falling off or dying and becoming ineffective.
    The experience of promoting peanut rhizobium inoculant in recent years has proven that using peanut rhizobium inoculant can generally increase the average yield per mu by 15% or more. For example, the results of demonstration and promotion in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Rehe, and the suburbs of Beijing showed that the average yield per mu increased by 21% in 1951 and 17% in 1952. In 1952, 2,009 mu of peanuts in Dali and Chaoyi counties in Shaanxi Province were inoculated with rhizobia, with an average yield of 242 jin per mu, an increase of 19.4% compared to the local uninoculated peanuts. In the same year, 1,500 mu of peanuts in Fufeng and Mei counties increased their average yield by 18.2% due to inoculation with rhizobia.
    Promoting peanut rhizobium inoculant is a new task, so it is necessary to do a good job of publicity and demonstration for farmers. In 1950, when the Haiyang County People's Government in Shandong Province promoted the use of peanut rhizobium inoculant in coordination with the Jiaodong Agricultural Guidance Institute, the inoculation area expanded year by year and the peanut yield also increased year by year because the farmers were told about the benefits of using peanut rhizobium inoculant and helped demonstration households summarize their experience in increasing production. When the technical cadres of the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute worked in the two key promotion areas of Laiyang and Wendeng, they used methods such as specially invited trials and demonstration comparisons, and educated farmers with local actual production increase facts. In 1953, the area inoculated with rhizobia increased from 100,000 mu in the previous year to 150,000 mu. However, in some areas, because the cadres did not explain the benefits of rhizobium inoculant clearly, farmers mistakenly regarded the rhizobium inoculant as fertilizer, causing great waste.
    In addition, when promoting peanut rhizobium inoculant, it is also necessary to pay attention to the guidance of cultivation techniques. Peanut sowing must be timely, and its suitable germination temperature is about 18 degrees Celsius. In 1953, seed rotting occurred in some areas of Henan Province due to early sowing. Because these seeds were mixed with rhizobia, some farmers mistakenly believed that the rotting was caused by rhizobia. In barren sandy soil, sowing with peanut rhizobium inoculant must be combined with increasing the application of green manure and farm manure. In areas where the soil is deficient in phosphorus, it is also necessary to apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers appropriately, such as plant ash and superphosphate or rock phosphate, bone meal, rice bran, etc. Soil structure should be loose and tight, which is suitable for the reproduction of rhizobia and the growth and development of peanuts. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job of deep plowing and fine harrowing, as well as intertillage and weeding. In areas with irrigation conditions, inoculation and sowing can be done after irrigation to facilitate the invasion of rhizobia into young roots and their growth and reproduction.

    提高花生产量的一个好办法
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
    使用花生根瘤菌拌种剂，是提高花生单位面积产量一种最经济最简便有效的办法。花生是我国主要油料作物的一种，花生籽仁的含油率很高，榨油的副产物油饼并含有丰富的蛋白质，很适宜作饲料。由于这种作物的经济价值大，采取有效措施提高它的单位面积产量，就是一件具有重大意义的工作。
    花生是豆科植物，它的根部生着许多小瘤，小瘤内部有千千万万的微生物，这些微生物就是根瘤菌。根瘤菌和花生是共生关系。它能从空气中摄取固定游离氮素，变为花生可以直接吸收利用的含氮化合物，帮助花生生长发育。花生根瘤菌拌种剂可以用人工培养制造。目前华北农业科学研究所、山东省农业科学研究所、河南农林厅都制造花生根瘤菌拌种剂。在花生开花时，选择生长旺盛、根瘤又大又多的植株，连根掘出，摘去叶子悬在背阴处阴干保存（保存时应放在阴暗潮湿不通风的地方），也能作拌种剂。
    用花生根瘤菌拌种的方法很简单。在花生播种时，把三、五钱根瘤菌拌种剂放在碗里，加半斤清水充分混合，然后倒在十五斤到二十斤花生种子上（剥去外壳的）搅拌均匀，使每粒种子都能沾到根瘤菌拌种剂（用农民自己留储的根瘤菌时，在拌种前可把根瘤菌摘下磨碎加水拌在种上，拌一亩地用的花生种籽约需带有根瘤的花生二十株）。在拌种过程中间，都不要使根瘤菌受到直射阳光，拌好的种籽最好立即进行播种，以免种粒上附着的根瘤菌拌种剂干涸脱落或死亡失效。
    几年来推广花生根瘤菌拌种的经验证明：用花生根瘤菌拌种的，一般每亩平均可增产百分之十五以上。如在河北、山东、河南、陕西、广东、热河和北京郊区示范推广的结果，一九五一年平均每亩增产百分之二十一，一九五二年平均每亩增产百分之十七。陕西省大荔、朝邑两县一九五二年有二千零九亩花生拌了根瘤菌，每亩平均收二百四十二斤，较当地没有拌的增产百分之十九点四，同年扶风、郿县有一千五百亩花生因用根瘤菌拌种，平均每亩增产百分之十八点二。
    推广花生根瘤菌拌种是一项新的工作，因此必须向农民做好宣传和示范工作。一九五○年山东省海阳县人民政府配合胶东农业指导所，在推广使用花生根瘤菌拌种时，由于向农民说明了用花生根瘤菌拌种的好处，并帮助示范户总结了增产经验，因而拌种面积逐年扩大，花生的产量也随着逐年提高。山东省农业科学研究所的技术干部在莱阳、文登两重点推广区工作时，采用特约试验、示范对比等方法，用当地实际增产事实教育农民，一九五三年用根瘤菌拌种的面积由前一年的十万亩增加到了十五万亩。但也有些地区由于干部没有把根瘤菌拌种的好处说清楚，农民错误地把根瘤菌拌种剂当肥料，造成很大的浪费。
    此外，在推广花生根瘤菌拌种时，还必须注意栽培技术的指导。花生播种必须适时，它的适宜的发芽温度为摄氏十八度左右，一九五三年河南省一部分地区因播种过早，曾发生种籽腐烂现象，因为这些种籽拌过根瘤菌，有的农民就误认为腐烂是根瘤菌造成的。在瘠薄的沙土地里，用花生根瘤菌拌种播种，必须和增施草肥厩肥结合进行，在土壤里缺磷的地区同时还需要适当施用磷、钾肥料，如草木灰和过磷酸石灰或磷矿粉、骨粉、糠皮等。土壤结构松紧适宜，才适合根瘤菌的繁殖和花生的生长发育，因此必须做好深耕细耙和中耕锄草等工作。在有灌溉条件地区，可在灌水后拌种播种，便于根瘤菌侵入幼根，生长繁殖。
