Hailong County, Liaoning Province, is vigorously building mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects, and will increase paddy fields by 300 *qing* this year. The Shuguang Collective Farm in Anle Village is adopting the method of damming rivers and diverting water for irrigation, using a maximum of 1,500 man-days and horse-days, plus timber and other materials, totaling 20 million *yuan*. This type of water conservancy can irrigate 45 *qing* of land for planting rice, and the total product value will reach 360 million *yuan*. The collective farm has now prepared the timber and is starting to build the dam. The second type is that the Xing'an Village mutual aid team is using natural water pits. Only a 20-horsepower water pump and digging a 1,000-meter water line, using a total of 1,000 workdays, can irrigate 38 *qing* of paddy fields. The third type is the Zheng Hao mutual aid team in Shancheng Township, which raised 30 million *yuan* from its members to dig a 20-meter-deep well and use the existing power source to pump water with electricity, planning to irrigate 20 *qing* of land. The fourth type is the Honghua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heping Village, which dug out the spring eyes that had been blocked for many years by the village and used its water to irrigate three to four *qing* of rice land. In addition, there is the expansion of the cultivated area of the original paddy fields. In addition to assisting in the purchase of small water pumps and ordering ten Liberation-style waterwheels, the county people's government has also sent all water conservancy engineering technicians to help farmers with surveying and design. It is now at the height of small-scale water conservancy construction, and will be completed one after another at the end of April, ready to sow rice in early May. (Fang Qing)

    辽东省海龙县大力修筑小型水利
    辽东省海龙县正大力修筑群众性的小型水利，今年将增加水田三百垧。安乐村曙光集体农庄采取拦河堵坝、引水灌溉，最多用一千五百个人工和马工，加上木料等共计二千万元。这种水利可浇灌四十五垧土地，播种水稻，产品总值将达三亿六千万元。该集体农庄现已备妥木料，正动工修坝。第二种形式，兴安村互助组利用天然水坑，只要一台二十马力的抽水机，挖一千公尺的水线，共用一千个工，就可以浇三十八垧水田。第三种形式，山城镇郑豪一互助组，由组员集资三千万元，打一眼二十公尺深的井，利用现有电源，用电力抽水，计划浇地二十垧。第四种形式，和平村红华农业生产合作社，把村边堵塞多年的泉眼掏开，用它的水浇三至四垧稻地。此外还有原水田扩大耕种面积。县人民政府除协助购买小型抽水机，订购解放式水车十台外，并派出所有水利工程技术人员帮助农民测量和设计。现在正处于建筑小型水利的高潮，四月末将先后竣工，准备于五月上旬播稻。　（方青）
