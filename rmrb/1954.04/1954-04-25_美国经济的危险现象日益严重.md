    Dangerous Phenomena in the American Economy Are Growing More Serious
    By Felipov, Special Correspondent for the Soviet newspaper "Pravda"
    Recently, some prominent figures in the United States have often said "reassuring" words about the domestic economic situation. The National Association of Manufacturers, bourgeois economists, and the newspapers of American monopoly capital are also stepping up their propaganda of the deceptive claim of the "superiority of the American economy." The purpose of these "optimistic" statements is obvious: it is to eliminate the growing panic caused by the significant deterioration of the American economic situation.
    However, the "reassuring" words cannot dispel the worries of the American people.
    A recent article in "This Week" magazine (Sunday supplement to the "New York Herald Tribune") wrote: "Americans are now more panicked by the depression than ever before... Are we going back to the dark years of the early 1930s, back to queuing for bread and soup in front of the distribution stations, and will there be 12.8 million unemployed again?"
    Just by looking at some of the main specific materials illustrating the economic situation in the United States in the first few months of 1954, one can fully understand why these alarming questions that make the broad masses of the American people uneasy are now being raised.
    1. Industrial Production Continues to Decline
    The most powerful fact illustrating the current economic situation in the United States is the decline in industrial production that began in the summer of 1953.
    The scale and speed of this decline can be judged by the industrial production index officially published by the US Federal Reserve System.
    US Industrial Production Index:
   (1947-1949 = 100)
    July 1953 137
    August 136
    September 133
    October 132
    November 129
    December 126
    January 1954 125
    February 123
    March (according to partial statistics) 120
    It can be seen from this that since August 1953, industrial production in the United States has continued to decline month by month. Even according to official data, from July last year to February 1954, the production index fell by 14 points, or more than 10 percent.
    American newspapers pointed out anxiously that the current rate of production decline is greater than the rate during the economic depression of 1948-1949. The extent of the decline in the production index in the last seven months is equal to the extent of the decline during the entire depression of 1948-1949.
    The spreading production decline has affected all the most important sectors of American industry, although to varying degrees.
    Some official materials recently published in "US News & World Report" reflect the decline in industrial production in twenty-two industrial sectors over six months (from July to December 1953). These figures show that the output of ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industries fell by 20 percent, the output of bituminous coal in the coal mining industry fell by 19 percent, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry fell by 18 percent, the mining industry fell by 14 percent, the machinery manufacturing industry fell by 10 percent, the rubber industry fell by 9 percent, the timber industry fell by 8 percent, the transportation machinery manufacturing industry, including automobiles, fell by 7 percent, the chemical industry fell by 5 percent, and so on.
    In addition to heavy industry sectors, the production of light industry and food industry sectors is also declining significantly. For example, the output of the textile industry has been reduced by 20 percent, the sewing industry and furniture industry have been reduced by 13 percent, the leather-shoe industry has been reduced by 11 percent, the tobacco industry has been reduced by 8 percent, the food industry has been reduced by 6 percent, and so on.
    Despite the beautiful predictions made by American bourgeois economists, expecting that production would increase in March, industrial production continued to decline in March.
    The steel industry, which Americans call the barometer of production, only utilized 73.6 percent of its production capacity in February. The underutilization of steel plants was even more serious in March. In the first two weeks of March, its production capacity was utilized on average about 70 percent. In the week ending March 20, the production capacity utilized by the steel industry was 67.7 percent, while the following week it was only 66.5 percent. According to some materials published in newspapers, the production of the coal mining industry, automobile manufacturing industry, machine tool manufacturing industry, electrical machinery industry, and many other industrial sectors continued to decline in March.
    2. Increasing Difficulties in Selling Goods
    Just recently, some bourgeois economists asserted that the began production decline seemed to be able to sell the large quantities of inventory that had long been piled up in industrial warehouses and trading companies. As of the end of January 1954, the total value of inventories of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers reached 80.7 billion US dollars, which is 3.6 billion US dollars more than a year ago.
    But the problem is not just the amount of inventory. In recent months, due to the sharp increase in unemployment and the decline in residents' purchasing power, the sales volume of goods has also decreased significantly. According to American business newspapers, as a result, the contrast between the amount of inventory and the sales volume of goods has deteriorated sharply.
    According to the materials of the US Department of Commerce, in February 1954, the total amount of commodity inventory of American manufacturers was 1.5 billion US dollars more than a year ago. During the same period, the goods sold by industry to trading organizations decreased by 1.1 billion US dollars compared with February last year. Therefore, the problem of eliminating a large amount of excess commodity inventory is even more difficult for the American economy. American capitalists will have to continue to reduce production continuously in order to alleviate the phenomenon of commodity surplus.
    In recent months, new order sources in some of the most important industrial sectors in the United States have been greatly reduced. "Wall Street and Business Analysis" reported that from June 1953 to January 1954, new orders in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industry decreased by 40 percent, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry decreased by 25 percent, the transportation machinery manufacturing industry decreased by 25 percent, and so on. At the end of 1953, heavy industry received 23 percent fewer orders than at the end of 1952. The magazine emphasized that the rate of decline in new orders is unprecedented. The magazine wrote: "The rate of decrease in new orders in the last few months of 1953 was greater than at any time after the war."
    The situation did not improve at the beginning of this year. For example, in February, the orders received by all processing industry sectors were 2.6 billion US dollars less than the same period last year, while in February this year, undelivered orders were 21.6 billion US dollars less than last year, a decrease of a quarter.
    The rapid increase in the number of unemployed is constantly shrinking the domestic market. For example, according to a recent report in "The New York Times", in the nine weeks of this year, in Detroit, where the number of unemployed has increased sharply, the sales volume of department stores has decreased by more than a quarter.
    In January and February this year, the national retail trade volume in the United States decreased by 4 percent compared with the first half of last year. Trade continued to decline in March. In the four weeks of March, the sales volume of department stores decreased by 11 percent compared with the same period last year.
    Due to the general deterioration of the national economy, the demand for consumer credit has also begun to decline. In January and February, the total amount of consumer credit decreased by 656 million US dollars compared with December last year.
    "Commercial Magazine" wrote: "The decline in consumer credit is mainly caused by the recession in commercial activities and the reduction in the number of employed people and the increase in the number of unemployed... Due to the continuous decrease in the number of employed people and the continuous decrease in income, paying consumer debt has become a particularly heavy burden."
    Due to the continuous impoverishment of the working people and the continuous shrinking of the domestic market, American production is experiencing increasing sales difficulties, and this difficulty is further aggravated by the continuous decrease in American foreign trade. In the past year alone, American commercial exports decreased by 1 billion US dollars, a decrease of 7 percent.
    In the first few months of 1954, the situation of American exporters deteriorated further. In January, they exported 111.1 million US dollars less goods to foreign countries than in the same period last year. According to preliminary materials, the total export volume in February was less than any month in 1953.
    While American industrial production is constantly declining, the crisis phenomenon in American agriculture is also deepening. In 1953, the total income of farmers decreased by 16 percent, and now the total income of farmers has fallen to the lowest level in 30 years. Tens of thousands of small and medium-sized farmers went bankrupt again last year. The intertwining of the crisis phenomenon in agriculture and the recession in industrial production has accelerated the development of the American economic crisis.
    3. The Profits of Monopoly Capital Are Increasing, and the Income of the Working People Is Decreasing
    American monopoly capitalists are trying their best to place the main burden of the approaching economic crisis on the shoulders of the working people. The increasing reduction in production has accelerated the impoverishment of the American working class. According to the statistics of American bourgeois economists, only due to the increase in the number of unemployed and the reduction in the number of working days per week, since mid-summer last year, the total actual wages of American workers and employees (before tax) have decreased by 6 billion US dollars calculated at an annual rate. This figure is undoubtedly greatly reduced. In fact, American workers and employees have lost much more income than this.
    On the other hand, monopoly capitalists continue to extract terrifying huge profits. The vast majority of profits fall into the hands of those large monopoly capitalists who are busy fulfilling the most profitable government military orders.
    In order to pursue maximum profits, American monopoly capitalists continue to drag the American economy onto the road of crazy expansion of armaments. The American reactionary groups attempt to postpone the arrival of the economic crisis and alleviate the destructive effects of the economic crisis by means of huge armament plans, so they try their best to incite war hysteria and do everything possible to aggravate international tensions. However, it has never been as obvious as it is today: the crazy policy of universal militarization of the economy pursued by the American ruling groups not only cannot stop the economic crisis, but on the contrary, it makes the phenomenon of the American economic crisis more acute.

    美国经济的危险现象日益严重
    苏联“真理报”特派记者  费利波夫
    最近美国的一些显要人物常常对国内的经济情况说一些“定心”的话。全国制造商协会、资产阶级经济学家和美国垄断资本的报刊也在加紧宣传“美国经济的优势”这种骗人的说法。这些“乐观”说法的目的是显而易见的：这就是为了消除因美国经济情况的显著恶化而引起的日趋严重的惊慌。
    可是，“定心”话打消不了美国人民的忧虑。
    最近“这一周”杂志（“纽约先驱论坛报”星期日副刊）上刊载的一篇文章写道：“美国人现在由于萧条而产生的惊慌比任何时候都厉害……我们是不是又要回到三十年代初的那种阴暗岁月中去，又要在配给站前排队要面包、要汤，又会有一千二百八十万人失业呢？”
    只要看一下说明美国一九五四年最初几个月的经济情况的一些主要的具体材料，那末就可以完全理解为什么现在会提出使美国广大阶层的人民惴惴不安的这些令人惊心的问题了。
    一、工业生产继续下降
    说明目前美国经济情况的最有力的一个事实就是一九五三年夏季开始以来的工业生产的下降。
    关于这一下降的规模和速度，可以根据美国联邦储备系统管理局官方公布的工业生产指数来判断。
    美国工业生产指数：
   （以一九四七—一九四九年为一百）
    一九五三年七月　一三七
              八月　一三六
              九月　一三三
              十月　一三二
              十一月　一二九
              十二月　一二六
    一九五四年一月　一二五
              二月　一二三
              三月（据部分统计）　一二○
    由此可见，从一九五三年八月开始，美国的工业生产逐月不断下降。即以官方的材料来看，从去年七月到一九五四年二月，生产指数就下降了十四点，即下降了百分之十强。
    美国报纸惴惴不安地指出，目前生产下降的速度要比一九四八—一九四九年经济萧条时期的速度为大。最近七个月中生产指数下降的程度，已等于一九四八—一九四九年整个萧条时期下降的程度。
    蔓延中的生产下降已波及到美国工业中所有最重要的部门，虽然在程度上有所不同。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”不久以前刊载的一些官方材料，反映了二十二个工业部门六个月中（从一九五三年七月起到同年十二月止）工业生产下降的情况。这些数字说明：黑色金属与有色金属冶炼业的产量下降了百分之二十，采煤工业的烟煤产量下降了百分之十九，电力机械制造工业下降了百分之十八，采矿工业下降了百分之十四，机器制造业下降了百分之十，橡胶工业下降了百分之九，木材工业下降了百分之八，运输机器制造业，包括汽车在内下降了百分之七，化学工业下降了百分之五等等。
    除重工业部门以外，轻工业和食品工业部门的生产也在大量地下降。例如，纺织工业的产量缩减了百分之二十，缝纫工业和家具工业缩减了百分之十三，皮革—制鞋工业缩减了百分之十一，烟草工业缩减了百分之八，食品工业缩减了百分之六等等。
    尽管美国资产阶级经济学家作了美丽的预测，期待着生产会在三月份提高，但三月份的工业生产仍然继续下降。
    被美国人称为生产晴雨表的炼钢工业，其生产能力在二月份仅被利用百分之七三点六。三月份各炼钢厂开工不足的情况更为严重。在三月份最初两周其生产能力平均约被利用百分之七十。在三月二十日为止的一周中，炼钢工业被利用的生产能力为百分之六十七点七，而次一周只及百分之六十六点五。根据报纸上刊载的一些材料判断，三月份采煤工业、汽车制造业、母机制造业、电机工业和其他许多工业部门的生产仍在继续下降。
    二、销售商品的困难在增加
    就在不久以前，一些资产阶级的经济学家还断言：开始了的生产下降似乎可以使早已堆积在工业仓库和贸易企业中的大批存货销售出去。截至一九五四年一月底，制造商及批发商和零售商的存货总值达八百零七亿美元，即超过一年前三十六亿美元。
    但是问题还不仅止于存货的数量。最近几个月由于失业人数的剧增以及居民购买力的下降，商品的销售量也大大地减少了。据美国商界的报纸说，由于这样的结果，存货的数量与商品销售量的对比已急剧恶化。
    根据美国商业部的材料，一九五四年二月，美国制造商的商品存货总量比一年以前多十五亿美元。而在同时期内，工业销售给贸易机构的商品比去年二月下降了十一亿美元。因此，消除大量过剩的商品存货这一问题，对于美国经济说来，是更加困难了。美国资本家为了减轻商品过剩的现象，将不得不继续不断地缩减生产。
    最近几个月来，美国一些最重要的工业部门的新的订货来源大大减少了。“华尔街与商业分析”报道，从一九五三年六月到一九五四年一月这个时期内，黑色金属和有色金属冶炼业的新订货减少了百分之四十，电机制造业减少了百分之二十五，运输机器制造业减少了百分之二十五等等。一九五三年底重工业所得到的订货比一九五二年底少百分之二十三。该杂志着重指出，新的订货下降速度之快是空前的。该杂志写道：“在一九五三年的最后几个月内新订货的减少速度比战后任何时候都大。”
    今年年初情况并没有好转。例如在二月，所有加工工业部门所得到的订货比去年同时期少二十六亿美元，而在今年二月，未交货的订货比去年减少了二百一十六亿美元，即减少了四分之一。
    失业人数的迅速增加，使国内市场不断缩小。例如，据“纽约时报”最近报道，在今年的九个星期内，在失业人数急剧增加的底特律，百货公司的销货量减少了四分之一以上。
    在今年一月份和二月份，美国全国的零售贸易量比去年上半年减少了百分之四。三月份贸易仍继续下降。在三月份的四个星期内，百货公司的销货量比去年同时期减少了百分之十一。
    由于全国经济的普遍恶化，消费者信用的需求量也开始下降。在一月和二月份内，消费者信用总额比去年十二月减少了六亿五千六百万美元。
    “商业杂志”写道：“消费者信用的下降首先是由于商业活动的衰退和就业人数的减少以及失业人数的增加而造成的……由于就业人数不断减少，收入不断下降，支付消费者债务便成为特别沉重的负担。”
    由于劳动人民不断贫困化和国内市场不断缩小，美国的生产正经历着日益增长的销售困难，而且由于美国对外贸易不断减少，这种困难更加加重了。仅在去年一年内，美国的商业出口就下降了十亿美元，即下降了百分之七。
    在一九五四年的头几个月内，美国出口商的情况更加恶化。一月份，他们向国外输出的商品比去年同时期减少了一亿一千一百万美元。根据初步材料，二月份的出口总额比一九五三年任何一个月都要少。
    与美国工业生产不断衰退的同时，美国农业中的危机现象也日益深刻化。一九五三年农民的总收入减少了百分之十六，而现在农民的总收入已下降到三十年来最低的水平。去年又有数万个中小农民破产。农业的危机现象和工业生产的衰退相互交错的情况，加速了美国经济危机的发展。
    三、垄断资本的利润日益增长劳动人民的收入日益下降
    美国垄断资本家正在竭力将日益迫近的经济危机的主要负担加在劳动人民的肩上。生产的日益缩减加速了美国工人阶级的贫困化。根据美国资产阶级经济学家的统计，仅由于失业人数的增加和每星期工作日的减少，从去年仲夏起，美国工人和职员的实际工资总额（纳税前）以年率来计算，减少了六十亿美元。这一数字无疑是大大缩小了的。实际上，美国工人和职员损失了比此多得多的收入。
    另一方面，垄断资本家却在继续榨取骇人听闻的巨额利润。极大部分的利润都落到那些忙着履行最有利可图的政府军事订货的大垄断资本家的手中。
    美国垄断资本家为了追求最大限度的利润，继续不断地拖着美国的经济走疯狂的扩张军备的道路。美国反动集团企图借助于庞大的军备计划来推迟经济危机的到来和减轻经济危机的毁灭性的作用，于是他们就竭力煽动战争歇斯底里，千方百计地加剧国际紧张局势。然而从来没有像今天这样明显：美国统治集团所奉行的使经济普遍军事化的疯狂的方针不但不能阻挡经济危机，而且相反，使美国经济危机的现象更加尖锐化。　（新华社）
