Price Reduction Continued for Some Science and Technology Books

To alleviate the burden on readers and further meet the people's needs for science and technology books, the Mechanical Industry Publishing House, the Fuel Industry Publishing House, and the People's Medical Publishing House, with the approval of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, have continued to reduce book prices starting from the first quarter of 1954. Taking the 1953 pricing standards of these three publishing houses as 100, the average price reduction for general books of the Mechanical Industry Publishing House is 14 to 15 percent for 25mo format and 10.8 to 11.6 percent for 32mo format; the average price reduction for general books of the Fuel Industry Publishing House is 11.6 to 18.6 percent for 25mo format and 3.4 to 11.1 percent for 32mo format; and the average price reduction for general books of the People's Medical Publishing House is 11.4 percent for 32mo format.

These three publishing houses publish science and technology books, which are printed in smaller quantities and have higher typesetting and printing costs, resulting in higher costs and therefore higher prices than general political and literary books. The Mechanical Industry Publishing House and the Fuel Industry Publishing House had previously reduced book prices once at the end of 1952 according to the instructions of the Publishing Administration. The People's Medical Publishing House was established on June 1, 1953. After the books originally published by the East China Medical and Health Life Press and the Northeast Medical Book Publishing House were transferred to the People's Medical Publishing House, the average price was reduced by approximately 30 percent in 1953.

    部分科学技术书籍继续降低书价
    为了减轻读者负担，并进一步满足人民对科学技术书籍的需要，机械工业出版社、燃料工业出版社、人民卫生出版社经中央人民政府出版总署批准，已自一九五四年第一季起继续降低书价。如以一九五三年这三个出版社的书籍定价标准为一百，机械工业出版社的一般图书，二十五开本的平均降低书价百分之十四到十五，三十二开本的平均降低书价百分之十点八到十一点六；燃料工业出版社的一般图书，二十五开本的平均降低书价百分之十一点六到十八点六，三十二开本的平均降低书价百分之三点四到十一点一；人民卫生出版社一般图书三十二开本的平均降低书价百分之十一点四。
    这三个出版社出版的都是科学技术书籍，这类书印数较少而排印工价较贵，成本较高，因此定价也高于一般政治和文艺书籍。机械工业出版社和燃料工业出版社在一九五二年底曾根据出版总署的指示，降低过一次书价。人民卫生出版社是在一九五三年六月一日成立的，原由华东医务生活社和东北医学图书出版社出版的图书在移交该社出版后，已在一九五三年平均降低书价百分之三十左右。
