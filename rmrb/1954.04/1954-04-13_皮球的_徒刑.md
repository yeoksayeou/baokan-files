    The Basketball's "Imprisonment"
    Lu Yuan
    The Beijing Department Store has a large backlog of basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls. These balls have been stored in the warehouse for a long time, and some have even begun to grow layers of white mold. Whether basketballs, volleyballs, or soccer balls, they should be flying and bouncing on the sports field, but these unfortunate balls have been inextricably linked to the warehouse since their birth. Now, although the Beijing Department Store has not formally "sentenced" these balls, based on last year's highest sales volume, their "sentence" in the warehouse will probably require two years or more before they can all be "released" to assume the tasks they should be undertaking.
    Last year, with the development of sports, the Beijing Department Store sold more than 25,000 basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls, greatly exceeding the supply of balls in previous years. Because balls sold quickly and in large quantities, the Beijing Department Store raised prices and purchased them in large quantities. The purchase price of a good ball was raised to 300,000 yuan, and the profit on general ball manufacturing increased to 40 percent. This abnormal procurement method stimulated some leather factories to blindly produce balls. Some leather factories that did not originally make balls began to make balls as a sideline because they saw high profits; some leather factories used leather that was not suitable for making balls in order to expand production. In January of last year, there were only nine private factories in Beijing producing balls, but by December, the number had increased to seventeen, and the production of balls had increased by nearly four and a half times.
    Even so, the Beijing Department Store seemed to still feel that it could not meet its own "needs," and purchased more than 12,000 balls from Guangzhou and Tianjin, and imported more than 6,600 balls from abroad. This continuous inflow of goods continued for nearly a year. At the end of last year, during the supply discussion at the national department store system supply conference, it was discovered that the current basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls were "difficult to sell domestically and had no way to be transferred elsewhere." At this time, the person in charge of the Beijing Department Store realized that their "appetite" for purchasing goods was too large.
    Faced with this situation, the Beijing Department Store made a decisive decision: to immediately stop all ball purchases. Making a decision is naturally easy, but 10 billion yuan of capital is tied up in the warehouse, and seventeen leather factories manufacturing balls have fallen into a state of semi-shutdown. One of the tasks of state-owned commerce is to promote the development of industrial production, but the Beijing Department Store has played the opposite role in the ball issue.
    The quality of commercial management not only affects commerce itself, but sometimes also affects the normal development of production. The once-popular balls have resulted in a backlog, which is a typical example.

    皮球的“徒刑”
    陆原
    北京市百货公司积压着一大批篮球、排球和足球。这些皮球在仓库里存放了很久，有的球已开始长上了一层层的白毛。不管是篮球、排球或足球，本来都应当在运动场中飞腾、跳动，可是这批不幸的球，从出世以来，就和仓库结了不解之缘。现在，北京市百货公司虽然还没有对这些球正式“宣判”，但依照去年的最高销售量推算，它们在仓库的“刑期”大概还需两年或更多的时间，然后才可全部“释放”，去担负它们所应担负的任务。
    去年，随着体育运动的开展，北京市百货公司推销了两万五千多个篮、排、足球，大大地超过了历年来皮球的供应量。因为皮球销售得快、销售得多，北京市百货公司就提高价格，大量收购。一个好球的收购价格提高到三十万元，一般制球的利润提高到百分之四十。这种不正常的收购办法，刺激了一些皮革工厂盲目生产皮球。有的皮革工厂本来不制球，看见利润高，就兼制皮球；有的皮革工厂为了扩大生产，把不适合制球的皮张也用来制球。去年一月，北京市生产皮球的私营工厂只有九家，到十二月就增加到十七家，皮球的生产量增加了将近四倍半。
    虽然这样，北京市百货公司好像还觉得不能满足自己的“需要”，又向广州、天津两市购进一万二千多个皮球，从国外进口六千六百多个皮球。这样源源不断地进货，一直继续了将近一年。去年年底，在全国百货系统供应会议上讨论供应的时候，才发现目前篮、排、足球是“自销困难，外调无路”。这时候，北京市百货公司的负责人才感到自己进货的“胃口太大”了。
    面临这种情况，北京市百货公司做出了一个断然的决定：就是立即全部停止收购皮球。做决定自然是容易的，可是，一百亿元的资金积压在仓库内，十七家制造皮球的皮革工厂陷入了半停工状态。国营商业的任务之一是促进工业生产发展，北京市百货公司在皮球问题上恰恰起了个相反的作用。
    商业上经营管理的好坏，不仅影响商业本身，有时还会影响生产的正常发展。畅销的皮球遭致了积压的结果，就是一个典型的例子。
