    The Death of Renowned Chinese Archaeologist Mr. Liang Siyong
    Mr. Liang Siyong, a renowned Chinese archaeologist and Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, passed away in Beijing at 4:40 PM on April 2nd due to years of overwork and unsuccessful treatment. His remains were cremated at the East Suburb People's Cemetery Crematorium on the afternoon of the 5th. Those who attended the memorial service and funeral included Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Vice Presidents Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhang Jiafu, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, and prominent figures in Chinese science and education circles such as Zhang Xiruo, Fan Wenlan, Qian Duansheng, Jian Bozan, Xiang Da, Yin Da, Liu Danian, Qian Sanqiang, Cao Richang, and all staff members of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    Mr. Liang Siyong was born in 1904 in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. He had been engaged in archaeological work for more than twenty years. He led and participated in the excavation of tombs and sites in Houjiazhuang Northwest Gang, Anyang Hougang, Longshan Town in Jinan, and archaeological surveys in Rehe, Heilongjiang, and other places. He wrote many papers and books on archaeology, including "Chengziya," "A Brief Record of the Hougang Excavation," "Xiaotun Longshan and Yangshao," "Neolithic Stone Tools and Pottery Collected from Chabugan Temple in Rehe, Shuangjing in Linxi, and Chifeng," and "Ang'angxi Prehistoric Site."

    Mr. Liang served as the Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1950. He was extremely concerned about and attached great importance to the work of the Institute of Archaeology. Even during his illness, he continued to plan and guide field investigations, excavations, and indoor research work. The achievements and development of archaeological research in China in the years since liberation are inseparable from Mr. Liang's efforts.

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences plans to hold a memorial meeting in the near future and will appoint someone to compile his posthumous works.

    我国著名考古学家梁思永先生逝世
    我国著名考古学家、中国科学院考古研究所副所长梁思永，因积劳成疾，久治无效，不幸于四月二日下午四时四十分在北京逝世。遗体于五日下午在东郊人民公墓火葬场举行火葬。参加吊祭和葬仪的有中国科学院院长郭沫若、副院长李四光、陶孟和、张稼夫、竺可桢、吴有训和我国著名科学、教育界人士张奚若、范文澜、钱端升、翦伯赞、向达、尹达、刘大年、钱三强、曹日昌等及中国科学院考古研究所全体工作人员。
    梁思永先生生于一九○四年，广东省新会县人，从事考古事业已经二十多年。他曾领导和参加河南安阳侯家庄西北岗、安阳后岗、济南龙山镇等墓葬和遗址的发掘工作及热河、黑龙江等处的考古调查工作，写有不少关于考古学的论文、著作。主要的有“城子崖”、“后岗发掘小记”、“小屯龙山与仰韶”、“热河查不干庙林西双井赤峰等处所采集之新石器时代石器与陶片”、“昂昂溪史前遗址”等。
    梁先生于一九五○年担任中国科学院考古研究所副所长，对于中国科学院考古研究所的工作极为关心和重视，在卧病期间，仍不断计划和指导田野调查发掘和室内的研究工作。解放后数年来，中国考古研究工作方面的成就和发展，是和梁先生的努力分不开的。
    中国科学院准备在最近期间举行纪念会，并将指定专人整理他的遗著。
