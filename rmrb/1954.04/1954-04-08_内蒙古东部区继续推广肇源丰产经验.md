The eastern region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region achieved remarkable results last year in promoting the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan (formerly Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner). This year, it will continue to implement the policy of "extensive publicity and focused promotion," carry out a mass technological reform movement, and fulfill and surpass this year's grain production tasks. This year, the eastern region will focus on the experiences that were successfully promoted last year, with agricultural production cooperatives as the center of promotion, planning to extend the area to 10% of the fixed yield land.

Last year, before spring plowing, the eastern region organized cadres and farmers from various places to visit Zhaoyuan for on-site observation. Afterwards, Party and government organs in various regions organized cadres to go to the countryside, combining local high-yield experiences to publicize Zhaoyuan's new farming methods to farmers, enhancing farmers' understanding of agricultural technology. In the spring and summer seasons, various regions trained approximately 106,000 male and female farmers. They learned new farming methods and became the backbone of agricultural technology reform. Various regions also modified more than 50,700 old farm tools. Twenty banners and counties cultivated typical examples of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience and organized farmers to conduct observation and learning, thereby greatly improving the quality of field operations last year.

The promotion of Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience enriched the content of mutual aid and cooperation. At the same time, district and village cadres also began to pay attention to mastering production technology, delving into the production process, and learning to lead production, which was welcomed by farmers. Under the influence of Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, the farming techniques of farmers in various regions have also been significantly improved. For example, they paid attention to protecting seedlings, increasing the number of plants, and increasing the number of hoeing, basically overcoming crude farming methods, and greatly reducing the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows. Therefore, although some areas in the eastern region suffered disasters last year, the total value of grain production increased by 10% compared to 1952.

    内蒙古东部区继续推广肇源丰产经验
    内蒙古自治区东部区去年推广肇源（郭尔罗斯后旗）丰产经验成绩显著，今年将继续贯彻“普遍宣传，重点推广”的方针，开展群众性的技术改革运动，完成和超额完成今年粮食增产任务。今年东部区以去年推广成功的经验为宣传重点，农业生产合作社为推广的中心，计划推广面积占定产地百分之十。
    去年，东部区在备耕前，曾组织各地干部和农民去肇源实地参观，以后各地党政机关又组织干部下乡，结合当地丰产经验向农民宣传了肇源新耕作法，提高了农民对农业技术的认识。各地在春夏两季，训练了约十万六千多名男女农民。他们学会了新耕作法，成了农业技术改革中的骨干。各地并改制旧农具五万零七百余件。有二十个旗、县培养了推广肇源丰产经验的典型，并组织农民进行了观摩学习，因而大大提高了去年的田间作业质量。
    推广肇源丰产经验，充实了互助合作的内容，同时区、村干部也开始注意掌握生产技术，深入生产过程，学会了领导生产，受到农民的欢迎。在肇源丰产经验的影响下，各地农民的耕作技术也有显著改进，如注意了保苗，庄稼的棵数增多，还增加了铲趟的次数，基本上克服了粗糙的耕作方法，缺苗断条现象大大减少。因此，去年东部区的部分地方虽然受到灾害，粮食的增产总值仍比一九五二年增加百分之十。
