Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 28th: TASS, Geneva, April 28th: V.M. Molotov and Bidault held their second meeting at the headquarters of the Soviet delegation at 11:00 a.m. on April 28th. They continued to exchange opinions on the list of countries participating in the Geneva Conference on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. At the last meeting, Bidault proposed that the countries participating in the discussion on the Indochina issue, in addition to the five major powers, should also include the three Indochinese countries - Bao Dai Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Molotov did not object to this view, but he pointed out: the representatives of the other side, namely Democratic Vietnam, should also participate in the discussion, which is only natural. However, Bidault did not express a clear attitude on this issue. The two sides agreed to continue to exchange opinions. At today's meeting, Bidault stated that before an agreement could be reached on the list of countries participating in the discussion on the Indochina issue, the issue of evacuating the wounded from the Dien Bien Phu area must be resolved. Molotov replied that the Soviet delegation agreed that the issue of the wounded should be resolved as soon as possible and advocated that representatives of the countries concerned should meet immediately - in Geneva if necessary - to resolve the above issue as soon as possible. V.M. Molotov pointed out that the Berlin Conference Communiqué did not stipulate any preconditions for determining the participating countries of the conference. The communiqué only pointed out that the countries participating in the conference on the Indochina issue, in addition to the five major powers, should also include other relevant countries, which of course includes the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Bidault said that he would have to go back and consult on this issue.

    莫洛托夫外长与皮杜尔举行第二次会谈
    就参加讨论印度支那问题的国家名单交换意见
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社日内瓦二十八日讯：维·米·莫洛托夫与皮杜尔于四月二十八日上午十一时在苏联代表团本部举行他们的第二次会谈。他们继续就参加日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平问题的讨论的国家名单交换意见。在上次会议上，皮杜尔提出参加会议关于印度支那问题的讨论的国家，除了五大国以外，还有印度支那三个国家——保大越南、寮国和高棉。莫洛托夫并不反对这种意见，但是他指出：另一方，即民主越南的代表也应该参加讨论，这是理所当然的事。但是皮杜尔没有在这个问题上表示明确的态度。双方同意继续交换意见。在今天的会议上，皮杜尔表示，在就参加印度支那问题的讨论的国家名单问题达成协议以前，必须解决撤退奠边府地区伤兵的问题。莫洛托夫回答说：苏联代表团同意伤兵问题尽速解决，并主张有关各国的代表立即开会——假使有必要的话，就在日内瓦开会——以尽早地解决上述问题。维·米·莫洛托夫指出：柏林会议公报没有规定决定会议参加国的任何先决条件。公报仅仅指出，参加关于印度支那问题会议的国家，除了五大国以外，还应该有其他有关国家，其中当然包括越南民主共和国在内。皮杜尔说：在这个问题上他还要回去商量。
