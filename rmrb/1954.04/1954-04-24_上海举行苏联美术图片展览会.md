The "Soviet Art Picture Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the East China Artists Association and the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, opened on April 21st at the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall. The exhibition features over 300 pictures of oil paintings, sculptures, book illustrations, and caricatures. Most of the original works were exhibited at the "All-Soviet Art Exhibition" in 1950, 1951, and 1952, and many are excellent works that have won Stalin Prizes.

The exhibits are divided into two major sections: classical and modern. The classical works include pieces by Russian realist artists of the 16th to 19th centuries, such as Repin, Kramskoi, Surikov, and Shishkin. The modern works include pieces by Gerasimov, Belousov, Zhukov, and Neprintsev. The themes of these works include portraits of leaders and their revolutionary activities, historical events of the Soviet state and the Soviet people's struggle to defend their motherland and peace, the cause of communist construction, and the life of the Soviet people. Also on display are illustrations from Gogol's "The Overcoat," "Dead Souls," and "The Portrait," as well as Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don," and several caricatures. (Xinhua News Agency) Correction: In the second line of the second-to-last paragraph of the editorial "Strictly Abide by the Principle of Collective Leadership" on page one of this newspaper on April 23, "Party Congress" should be deleted.
