Mr. Chairman, esteemed Foreign Ministers:

The Geneva Conference discussing the Korean question has focused the attention of the entire world. The Korean people expect this conference to contribute to a peaceful settlement of the Korean question and therefore attach great importance to it. Undoubtedly, the peaceful adjustment of the Korean question is not only of great significance to Korea but also to the common cause of ensuring peace and security in the Far East and easing tensions in international relations.

The main task of resolving the Korean question is to complete the national reunification of Korea and to create a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state based on peaceful means. Therefore, the Korean people believe that the Geneva Conference will formulate and adopt resolutions that will help transition from armistice to lasting peace and peacefully unify Korea based on democratic principles.

As is well known, Korea has a long history as an independent and sovereign state. The freedom-loving Korean people have defended their national independence and resisted foreign aggression more than once or twice. The Korean people continued their brave struggle for more than forty years against Japanese occupiers for their national liberation and the restoration of their national sovereignty. In 1945, the victory over Japan, achieved thanks to the decisive role of the Soviet army, brought liberation to the Korean people and freed them from the colonial shackles of Japanese imperialism. This is a fact known to the whole world. After liberation, the Korean people took control of their sovereignty and began to build a democratic and nationally independent country. People spontaneously established local democratic organs of power—People's Committees—in every corner of Korea. However, these People's Committees were only able to function normally and implement various democratic reforms in North Korea, where the Soviet army was stationed. In contrast, in South Korea under American occupation, the People's Committees were forced to disband, and the people's basic democratic rights and freedoms were completely deprived. Thus, from the very beginning of liberation, Korea developed in two different directions.

The Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain held in December 1945 was an important step in resolving the Korean question. The resolution on the Korean issue adopted by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference pointed out: "With a view to the re-establishment of Korea as an independent state, the creation of conditions for developing Korea on democratic principles, and the earliest possible liquidation of the evil results of the long Japanese domination in Korea, there shall be set up a provisional Korean democratic government which shall take all necessary steps for developing the industry, transport and agriculture and the national culture of the Korean people." However, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference resolution on the Korean issue, which conformed to the fundamental interests of the Korean people, was not implemented because the US government refused to fulfill its responsibilities under the resolution.

Instead of assisting in the establishment of a democratic Korean provisional government, the American ruling class adopted a line of dividing Korea, conducting illegal South Korean "May 10th Single Election" under police repression. Even the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea had to admit the illegality of this election conducted in South Korea. The commission issued a communique on the results of the election supervision, stating: "This election does not include all of North and South Korea, nor does it include all or most of the existing political parties and social organizations, therefore we are fully aware that it is not a national election." The communique continued, "In some places, the police were in the polling place." Separate elections caused the division of Korea; therefore, the democratic forces in Korea launched a struggle against separate elections everywhere. Political parties and social organizations from North and South Korea, with different political views and ideologies, convened a joint conference of representatives in Pyongyang in April 1948. The conference decided to boycott the "May 10th Single Election" and discussed concrete steps to complete the peaceful unification of Korea on democratic principles.

Based on the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference resolution on the Korean issue, the people of North Korea implemented fundamental democratic reforms. As a result of the land reform, 727,522 households of landless or land-poor farmers were distributed more than one million hectares of land confiscated from Japanese landlords, pro-Japanese elements, and national traitors. Following the land reform, large and medium-sized enterprises, transportation, banks, and post and telecommunications institutions were nationalized. As a result of the implementation of democratic reforms, North Korea's national economy developed rapidly. As a result of the successful completion of the national economic plan, the industrial production level in 1947-1948 already exceeded the level in 1944, and the industrial production level in 1950 increased by 51.4 percent compared to 1944. Great achievements have also been made in rural economy. The total output of the main products—rice and grain—reached 148 percent of that in 1944 in 1949. As a result, North Korea, which had previously felt a shortage of food, made great achievements in solving the food problem in a short period of time. The welfare of the people of North Korea improved year by year, and unemployment was completely eliminated. In North Korea, great achievements have also been made in the development of the national culture of the Korean people. Before liberation, there was not even one university in the North Korean region, but in 1949 there were fifteen universities headed by Kim Il-sung University, and tens of thousands of young men and women were studying at these universities.

The general election involving all the people of North and South Korea, implemented in August 1948, fully demonstrated the indomitable will of the Korean people to strive for the peaceful unification of their motherland on democratic principles. As a result of the election, the highest legislative organ of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—the Supreme People's Assembly—was established, and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established.

In South Korea, on the contrary, anti-democratic elements who had assisted Japanese imperialism in the past, under the protection of the American occupation forces, still dominated political and economic life. No democratic reforms have been implemented in South Korea, and the people's most basic human rights and democratic freedoms have not been guaranteed. The so-called "agricultural land reform" implemented in South Korea failed to improve the lives of farmers. After the implementation of the so-called "agricultural land reform," the land was still in the hands of the landlords, and the farmers were still landless and in poverty. The workers and staff in South Korea suffered cruel exploitation by the factory owners, and unemployment constantly tormented them, their lives were not improved in any way.

In order to end the division of Korea and complete the independence of the motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has proposed three plans for the peaceful unification of Korea. As is well known: the first plan was proposed on June 28, 1949, in the name of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland; the second was proposed as a call from the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland, proposing the idea of peacefully unifying Korea. The third plan, proposed by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 19, 1950, advocated realizing the peaceful unification of the motherland by uniting the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea as a single all-Korean legislative body.

However, the authorities of the Republic of Korea did not respond to the above-mentioned plan of North Korea for the peaceful unification of the motherland, but under the instigation of the United States, attempted to impose their own system on North Korea. The arduous and bloody war of more than three years has brought great trials and difficulties to the Korean people. This war broke out due to foreign interference. The people of the world have already witnessed the barbaric war methods used by the American interventionists and their accomplices against North Korea. The just war of liberation of the fatherland of the Korean people has been supported and sympathized with by all progressive mankind. In the People's Republic of China, the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend the country was widely launched. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army departed for Korea and selflessly assisted the Korean people in their just struggle for freedom and independence. The assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean people is an important guarantee for the Korean people to win victory over foreign armed interventionists.

The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. The Korean armistice opened the way for the peaceful unification of Korea based on democratic principles. It is obvious that the achievement of this goal must be possible only if both sides abide by the terms of the armistice agreement and strive to ensure lasting peace in Korea. But South Korea is clamoring to continue repeating acts of war. The South Korean authorities are increasing their own army, and the United States is violating the armistice agreement by transporting large quantities of military supplies into Korea. Furthermore, the United States and South Korea have signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," which stipulates the stationing of American troops in South Korea and the adoption of other military steps. At the same time, one cannot fail to mention the issue of prisoners of war. All prisoners of war should have returned to their homes in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement to live a peaceful life. However, as many as 48,000 of our captured personnel were illegally detained by the United Nations Command and incorporated into the "South Korean Army" and Chiang Kai-shek's army.

All this does not help the peaceful adjustment of the Korean question. We believe that in order to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War and completely peacefully adjust the Korean question, both sides must take necessary steps.

The presence of foreign troops in Korea will inevitably lead to foreign interference in Korea's internal affairs. Therefore, the withdrawal of foreign troops is one of the important factors in achieving Korea's democratic, peaceful, and unified status.

The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that all foreign troops must be withdrawn within six months. We advocate that the cause of peacefully unifying Korea must be handled by the Koreans themselves, without any foreign interference.

We believe that it is necessary to reach an agreement here on holding a nationwide free election with the participation of all the people of North and South Korea.

The peaceful unification of Korea must be realized by establishing a nationwide democratic unified government representing the entire Korean people. Such a government can only be established through an all-Korean election based on the free will of the Korean people.

We believe that in order to discuss the specific steps for preparing for and conducting democratic elections, it is necessary to convene a joint conference of representatives from North and South Korea, and at this conference, an all-Korean committee should be formed. This committee should implement concrete measures to promote economic and cultural rapprochement between North and South Korea. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is willing to present the following plan for the peaceful adjustment of the Korean question for your discussion.

### 在日内瓦会议四月二十七日会议上  南日外务相的发言

    在日内瓦会议四月二十七日会议上
    南日外务相的发言主席先生：各位外长先生：
    讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议集中了全世界的注意。朝鲜人民期望这次会议将有助于和平解决朝鲜问题，因此赋予它重要意义。毫无疑问的，朝鲜问题的和平调整不仅对朝鲜具有重大意义并对保证远东的和平与安全和缓和国际关系上的紧张局势的共同伟业也具有重大的意义。
    解决朝鲜问题的主要任务是完成朝鲜的民族统一，依据和平方式创建统一、独立、民主的朝鲜国家。因此朝鲜人民相信日内瓦会议会制订并通过将有助于由停战走向稳固的和平及依据民主原则和平统一朝鲜的决议。
    如众所周知，朝鲜有着悠久的独立主权国家的历史。爱好自由的朝鲜人民保卫自己的民族独立，击退外国侵略不只是一两次。朝鲜人民为了自己的民族解放和恢复本国的自主权，反对日本强占者，继续了四十多年的勇敢的斗争。一九四五年，由于苏联军队的决定性作用所取得的对日胜利，给朝鲜人民带来了解放，使他们摆脱了日本帝国主义殖民地羁绊。这是全世界所周知的事实。解放后朝鲜人民掌握了主权，开始建设民主的民族独立国家。在朝鲜的每个角落里人民自动的建立地方民主政权机关——人民委员会。但是这些人民委员会只有在苏联军队驻扎的北朝鲜才得以正常的执行其职司，并实施了各项民主改革。与此相反，美军强占下的南朝鲜，人民委员会被迫解散，人民的起码的民主权利和自由全部被剥夺。从而朝鲜自解放之初即各向着两个不同的道路发展。
    一九四五年十二月在莫斯科召开的苏、美、英三国外长会议是解决朝鲜问题的重要步骤。莫斯科三外长会议所通过的决议指出：“为重建朝鲜成一独立国家，创造各种依据民主原则发展朝鲜之条件，及尽速清除日本在朝鲜长期统治之恶果起见，特设立一临时朝鲜民主政府，该政府须采取各种必要步骤，以发展朝鲜之工业、运输、农业及朝鲜人民之民族文化。”但是，符合于朝鲜人民的根本利益的莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜问题的决议，由于美国政府拒绝执行该决议赋予它的责任而未被实现。
    美国统治阶层采取了分裂朝鲜的路线来代替协助树立民主的朝鲜临时政府，在警察镇压的条件下进行了非法的南朝鲜“五·十单选”。联合国朝鲜临时委员会也不得不承认在南朝鲜进行的这一选举的非法性。该委员会就监督选举结果发表公报称：“此次选举未把北朝鲜和南朝鲜全包括在内，也未包括已存诸政党和社会团体的全部或大部，因此我们充分理会它不是全国性选举。”该公报继续说：“某些地方，警察在投票场内”。单独选举是造成朝鲜分裂的；所以朝鲜的民主力量，在各地展开了反对单独选举的斗争。具有不同的政治见解和思想的南北朝鲜的诸政党和社会团体，在一九四八年四月在平壤召开了代表联席会议。该会议决定抵制“五·十单选”，并讨论了在民主原则上完成朝鲜的和平统一的具体步骤。
    北朝鲜人民根据莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜问题的决议，实施了根本的各种民主改革，实施土地改革的结果，七二七、五二二户无地或少地的农民分得了从日本地主、亲日分子及民族叛徒手里没收的一百万公顷以上的土地。接着土地改革，大、中企业所，交通，银行，邮电机关，被收归国有。实施民主改革的结果，北朝鲜的国民经济有了迅速的发展。由于胜利的完成国民经济计划的结果，早在一九四七—一九四八年的工业生产水平已经超过了一九四四年水平，一九五零年的工业生产水平比一九四四年增加了百分之五十一点四。农村经济方面也取得了巨大成就。主要产物——米、谷的总产量在一九四九年达到一九四四年的百分之一百四十八。其结果，过去感到粮食不足的北朝鲜在短时间内解决粮食问题上取得了巨大成就。北朝鲜人民的福利一年比一年提高，失业现象完全消灭了。在北朝鲜，朝鲜人民的民族文化的发展也取得了巨大的成就。解放前北朝鲜地区连一所大学也没有，但在一九四九年就有以金日成大学为首的十五所大学，数万男女青年在这些大学读书。
    一九四八年八月实施的包括南北朝鲜全体人民的普选，充分表现了朝鲜人民争取在民主原则上和平统一祖国的不屈的意志。选举结果，创设了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的最高立法机关——最高人民会议，建立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。
    在南朝鲜则恰恰相反，过去协助日本帝国主义的反民主分子们在美国占领军的庇护下，仍然统治着政治经济生活。在南朝鲜还未实施任何民主改革，人民的最起码的人权和民主自由没有得到保障。南朝鲜实施的所谓“农地改革”未能改善农民的生活。实施了所谓“农地改革”之后，土地仍然掌握在地主们的手里，农民仍然没有土地而处在穷苦的境地。南朝鲜的工人、职员遭受厂主们的残酷剥削，失业不断折磨着他们，他们的生活没有得到任何改善。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了结束朝鲜的分裂状态，完成祖国独立，曾提出了三次和平统一朝鲜方案。如所周知：第一次方案在一九四九年六月二十八日以祖国统一民主主义战线的名义提出；第二次则作为祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会号召文，提出了和平统一朝鲜的意见。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在一九五零年六月十九日提出的第三次方案，主张以联合朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和大韩民国国会为单一的全朝鲜立法机关的办法，实现祖国的和平统一。
    但是大韩民国政权当局，对于和平统一祖国的北朝鲜的上述方案，未做任何答复，而在美国唆使之下，企图把自己的制度强加于北朝鲜。三年多来的艰苦的流血战争，给朝鲜人民带来了巨大的考验和困难，这个战争是由于外来的干涉而爆发的。全世界人民已经是美国干涉者及其帮凶们对北朝鲜使用的野蛮的战争方法的见证人。朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争受到了一切进步人类的支持与同情。在中华人民共和国，广泛地展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动，中国人民志愿军部队出发到朝鲜，不顾牺牲地援助了朝鲜人民争取自由和独立的正义斗争。中国人民志愿军给朝鲜人民的援助是朝鲜人民对外国武力干涉者取得胜利的重要保证。
    一九五三年七月二十七日签订了朝鲜停战协定，朝鲜停战开辟了依据民主原则和平统一朝鲜的道路。很显然，这一目的的达成，必须由双方遵守停战协定条款并努力保证朝鲜的稳固和平才有可能。但是南朝鲜却叫嚣着要继续重复战争行为。南朝鲜政权当局在增加着自己的军队，美国违反停战协定把大量军火运入朝鲜。并且美国和南朝鲜签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，规定留驻美军在南朝鲜和采取其他军事性步骤。与此同时，不能不提到有关战俘问题。一切战俘本应依照朝鲜停战协定返回家乡过和平生活。但是竟有四万八千名我方被俘人员被联合国军方面非法扣留，编入“韩国军队”和蒋介石军队。
    这一切都无助于和平调整朝鲜问题。我们认为，为了防止朝鲜战争的重起和完全的和平调整朝鲜问题，双方必须采取必要步骤。
    外国军队驻在朝鲜必将造成外国对朝鲜的内政干涉，因此外国军队的撤退是达成朝鲜的民主、和平、统一的重要因素之一。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团认为：必须在六个月以内撤出一切外国军队。我们主张：和平统一朝鲜的事业必须交给朝鲜人自己处理，不得有任何外国的干涉。
    我们认为在这里必须对实行南北朝鲜全体人民参加的全国性自由选举一事取得协议。
    朝鲜的和平统一必须以树立代表全朝鲜人民的全国性的民主统一政府的办法来实现。这种政府只有通过基于朝鲜人民的自由意志的全朝鲜选举才能够树立。
    我们认为，为了讨论筹备并进行民主选举的具体步骤，有必要召开南北朝鲜代表联席会议，并在这个会上应组成全朝鲜委员会。这个委员会应实行确切的措施，以促进南北朝鲜的经济及文化的接近。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团，愿提出和平调整朝鲜问题的下列方案，请各位讨论。
