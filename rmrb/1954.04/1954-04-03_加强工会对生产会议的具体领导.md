Strengthening the Specific Leadership of Trade Unions over Production Meetings
    Shi Dong

In China's planned economic construction, trade union organizations in industrial and mining enterprises bear significant responsibilities. Trade unions must better unite, organize, and educate the working masses, inspire their class consciousness and enthusiasm for production and creativity, and strive to increase labor productivity to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. To accomplish this task, trade union organizations must carry out a great deal of work, and strengthening the leadership of production meetings is one of the important organizational forms for trade union organizations to mobilize and organize the working masses to improve production.

The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions made the following evaluation of production meetings: "Production meetings are the best mass organizational form for carrying out competition movements, promoting advanced experiences, and improving enterprise management. … This mass production meeting should be fixed as a system and made a powerful weapon for organizing mass labor." The fact that production meetings have been promoted in various industrial and mining enterprises over the past few years proves that production meetings are indeed a "powerful weapon for organizing mass labor." In some advanced factories and mines, such as the original China Changchun Railway and other enterprises, production meetings have played a significant role in improving production. Most of these advanced units have now consolidated production meetings as a system. Since last year, after strengthening planned management and establishing responsibility systems, especially after the launch of mass movements to increase production and practice economy, production meetings have also developed to some extent in some industrial and mining enterprises across the country. Some trade union organizations in some areas did not pay attention to production meetings in the past, but now they have started piloting them in key factories and mines, or have made appropriate improvements on the basis of the original production meetings in factories and mines. Most factories and mines in Northeast and North China, and some factories and mines in other regions, have implemented various types of production meetings, including production meetings held in workshops and sections to discuss production plans, product quality, improve labor productivity, and improve working conditions; various professional production meetings held to solve specific key production problems; and various liaison meetings held to unify operations and strengthen coordination, and production meetings held by the same type of work to exchange experiences, etc. In addition to administrative cadres, veteran workers, advanced producers, and technical personnel are the central figures in these production meetings. Although the names and practices of these production meetings vary, and most production meetings are not sound enough and are still in the initial stage, according to the situation of promoting production meetings in various places, it roughly has the following functions:

First, it can inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, solve the key issues of production in each period, and ensure the completion of the state plan. In various factories and mines, there is often such a situation: due to the production innovation of a certain process or the promotion of advanced experience, another process remains at the original level and becomes a weak link, thus a new imbalance appears in production; or due to management shortcomings and unreasonable labor organization, production cannot be connected, hindering the balanced progress of enterprise production; or due to technical difficulties encountered in manufacturing new products. This situation makes key problems that hinder production improvement constantly appear in enterprises. These problems are the central topics of various types of production meetings, and the masses can be organized to discuss and solve these key problems through production meetings. The key problems in production at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' steelmaking plant are solved through professional production meetings. For example, through the "fixed material steelmaking" production meeting, the masses were mobilized to overcome the waste situation of overspending an average of more than 4 billion yuan per month in raw materials in the past. Last September, the average cost of the entire plant was reduced by 1.5 billion yuan. In November last year, the water consumption of Liu Xianghe's team in the Yumen Oilfield exceeded the control number. They found the reason and solved it through the production meeting. The next day, the water consumption was reduced by more than 1,000 kilograms.

Second, the production meeting system can make the work of promoting advanced experience and rationalization proposals planned and regular. The basic problem of labor competition in factories and mines is to promote advanced experience, and the promotion of advanced experience must be carried out purposefully in response to key problems in production, and production meetings are an important method and good organizational form for regularly promoting advanced experience. For example, the workers of the gear group of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant learned and promoted advanced experience through production meetings. Forty-two of the eighty-two types of work in the group used the Kolesov tool method, and thirty-six used the multi-tool multi-blade cutting method, which increased production efficiency by three times. Since April last year, the Beijing People's Printing Factory has promoted 40 advanced experiences that can solve key production problems through production meetings, ensuring the completion of the monthly production plan.

Third, criticism and self-criticism can be carried out regularly from the bottom up through production meetings, so that the leadership of factories and workshops is closely combined with the masses. Because the factory director responsibility system is implemented in enterprises, the leadership is highly centralized. Therefore, it is necessary to fully promote democracy and give play to the supervisory role of the masses, so that the factory director responsibility system is established on a strong mass foundation. Production meetings are one of the best forms for the masses to actively participate in management. It is necessary to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to discuss the production work of the enterprise, analyze shortcomings, and think of ways to overcome shortcomings, so that the connection between the leader and the enterprise management agency and the masses is strengthened, and the leadership can better complete the state plan under the supervision and help of the masses. For example, the production meetings of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' steelmaking plant often carry out criticism and self-criticism. Workers have successively put forward opinions to the leadership on the responsibility system, safe production, and the work style of cadres, which has greatly helped to improve production and improve leadership work. The masses of workers also often receive help from the leadership at the meeting.

Finally, the role of production meetings is also reflected in: it effectively educates the employees, improves their class consciousness, and enables them to participate more actively and consciously in socialist construction. Production meetings also enable trade union organizations to better penetrate the masses, study production problems, get rid of the phenomenon of being busy and passive, and the bureaucratism in their work.

The role of production meetings in improving enterprise production is very significant. However, some trade union cadres and enterprise leaders have not paid enough attention to this advanced production meeting system. Some people express doubts about the role of production meetings, and even believe that promoting production meetings will affect the progress of other work, and put production meetings in opposition to other work. This view is obviously very wrong. Production meetings are not only not contradictory to other work in the enterprise, on the contrary, it is an important guarantee for the implementation of various tasks. The current more common situation is: the form of production meetings is also available in many enterprises, but most of them are only held when the production situation is tight and it is unavoidable. After the problem is solved, the production meeting is thrown aside, and rarely studied and summarized to improve it, let alone as a system to improve it. Some production meetings are held hastily, without sufficient preparation beforehand, and without serious handling afterwards, resulting in formality. Or, because the boundaries between production meetings and other meetings of trade unions and administrations are not clear, the meetings overlap, the content is poor, and the role played is very small. These enterprises must improve production meetings, strengthen leadership, enrich content, and gradually institutionalize production meetings. Before organizing production meetings in various enterprises, the leadership should purposefully convene them in order to solve the key problems in current production, and have detailed and correct meeting minutes and records, as well as specific plans for the implementation of the meeting decisions. Only by making the suggestions of workers at the production meeting truly play a practical effect can the interest of all staff members in the production meeting be improved, and the creativity of enterprise workers can be further promoted. Of course, in order to give better play to the role of production meetings, the improvement of enterprise management, the strengthening of enterprise political and ideological education, and the deepening of labor competition are also directly related to the success of production meetings.

Production meetings should be under the unified leadership of the Party committee and led by the trade union in particular, but it is not the trade union working alone. To hold production meetings well, the constant support of the workshop and the entire factory administration is required. The enterprise administration is not only a participant in production meetings, but also has actual leadership responsibilities for production meetings. Only when the administration and the trade union jointly and uniformly assume the responsibility of organizing production meetings can it be possible to streamline unnecessary repetitive meetings, reduce the number of meetings, shorten the meeting time, and distinguish them from the routine meetings of the administration and trade union, improve the quality of production meetings, and ensure that the meeting resolutions are implemented. In the work of organizing production meetings, trade unions should pay attention to studying and summarizing experiences in order to correct shortcomings and constantly improve and consolidate the production meeting system.

With the development of national industrial construction, the creative enthusiasm of the masses is very high, labor competition in enterprises is deepening, the content of production meetings will be richer, more detailed and specific, and its role will be more important. Therefore, the leading cadres of each enterprise, especially the trade union cadres, must pay attention to this work and practically improve the work of production meetings.

    加强工会对生产会议的具体领导
    史东
    在我国有计划的经济建设中，工矿企业的工会组织担负着重大的责任。工会必须更好地团结、组织和教育工人群众，启发工人群众的阶级觉悟和生产的积极性创造性，努力提高劳动生产率，加速国家的社会主义工业化。为完成这个任务，工会组织必须进行许多工作，而加强生产会议的领导，就是工会组织发动与组织工人群众搞好生产的重要组织形式之一。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会对生产会议曾作了这样的估价：“生产会议是开展竞赛运动、推广先进经验、改进企业管理的最好的群众性的组织形式。……应把这种群众性的生产会议当作一种制度固定下来，使它成为组织群众劳动的有力武器。”几年来各地工矿企业中推行生产会议的事实证明，生产会议确实是“组织群众劳动的有力武器”，在某些先进厂矿中，如原中长铁路等企业中，生产会议对改进生产发挥了很大作用，这些先进单位现在大多已把生产会议成为制度巩固下来了。全国各地若干工矿企业，自去年加强计划管理与建立责任制以后，特别是在群众性的增产节约竞赛开展以后，生产会议也有了某些发展。有些地区的工会组织原来对生产会议不重视，现在已着手在重点厂矿进行试点，或在厂矿原有生产例会的基础上作了适当的提高。东北和华北地区的大部分厂矿，其他地区的部分厂矿都推行了各种不同类型的生产会议，有在车间、工段为了讨论生产计划、产品质量、提高劳动生产率及改善劳动条件等问题而召开的生产会议；有为解决某个生产关键问题而召开的各种专业生产会议；也有为统一操作加强配合而召开的各种联系会议，有同工种为了交流经验而召开的生产会议等等。这些生产会议除行政干部参加外，老工人，先进生产者，技术人员是这些会议的中心人物。尽管这些生产会议的名称不一，作法也不尽相同，而且大多数生产会议还不够健全，还是处在初级阶段，但根据各地推行生产会议的情况，它大致上有如下几个作用：
    第一、能启发群众的积极性，集中群众智慧，解决每一时期的生产关键，保证国家计划的完成。各厂矿企业中常常有这种情形：由于某一工序的生产革新或推广了先进经验，另一工序仍停留在原有水平，而成为薄弱环节，因而生产上出现了新的不平衡现象；或者由于管理上的缺点，劳动组织上的不合理，使生产不能衔接，阻碍了企业生产的均衡进行；或者是由于制造新产品遇到技术上的困难。这种情形使得企业中不断出现阻碍生产提高的关键问题，这些问题，就是各种类型的生产会议的中心议题，通过生产会议就可以组织群众来讨论和解决这些关键问题。鞍钢炼钢厂生产上的关键问题，都是通过专业生产会议解决的。例如通过“定料炼钢”的生产会议，发动群众克服了过去每月原材料平均超支四十亿余元的浪费状况，去年九月全厂成本平均降低了十五亿元。去年十一月份，玉门油矿刘祥和班用水量超过了控制数，他们就通过生产会议找出了原因加以解决，第二天用水量就减低了一千余公斤。
    第二、生产会议制度能使推广先进经验和合理化建议的工作有计划地经常进行。厂矿企业中劳动竞赛的基本问题是推广先进经验，而推广先进经验必须针对生产中的关键问题有目的地进行，而生产会议正是经常推广先进经验的重要方法和良好组织形式。例如大连机床厂齿轮小组的工人群众，通过生产会议学习与推广了先进经验，全组八十二种活中四十二种运用了科列索夫车刀法，三十六种运用了多刀多刃切削法，使生产效率提高了三倍。北京市人民印刷厂从去年四月以来，通过生产会议，推广了四十件能解决生产关键的先进经验，保证了每月生产计划的完成。
    第三、通过生产会议可以经常开展自下而上的批评与自我批评，使工厂和车间的领导与群众密切结合。由于企业中实行厂长负责制，领导是高度集中的，因此就更需要充分地发扬民主，发挥群众的监督作用，使厂长负责制建立在坚强的群众基础上。而生产会议是群众积极参加管理的最好形式之一，它要运用批评与自我批评的武器，讨论企业的生产工作，分析缺点，并想出方法来克服缺点，因而也就使领导者及企业管理机关和群众的联系加强，使领导在群众的监督和帮助下，更好地完成国家计划。如鞍钢炼钢厂的生产会议，经常开展批评与自我批评，工人曾先后对领导上提出了有关责任制度、安全生产、干部工作作风方面的意见，对改进生产和改进领导工作帮助很大，工人群众在会上也经常得到领导上的帮助。
    最后，生产会议的作用还表现在：它实际有效地教育了职工群众，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，使他们能更积极地自觉地参加社会主义建设。生产会议也使工会组织能更好地深入群众，研究生产问题，摆脱忙乱被动现象和工作中的事务主义。
    生产会议对改进企业生产的作用是很大的。但仍然有些工会干部和企业领导同志对这个先进的生产会议制度，还没有引起足够的重视。有些人对生产会议的作用表示怀疑，甚至认为推行生产会议会影响其他工作的进行，把生产会议与其他工作对立起来，这种看法显然是十分错误的。生产会议不仅不和企业中的其他工作矛盾，相反地，它是贯彻各项工作的重要保证。目前较普遍的情况是：许多企业中生产会议的形式也有了，但大部分都是在生产情况紧张，迫不得已时才开，问题解决了，生产会议就扔在一边，很少研究总结，加以提高，更没有作为制度健全起来。有的生产会议开得草率，事先既不作充分准备，事后也不作严肃处理，结果流于形式。或者因生产会议和工会、行政的其他会议划不清界限，以致会议重叠，内容贫乏，所起作用很小。这些企业必须把生产会议提高一步，加强领导，充实内容，使生产会议逐步制度化。各企业在组织生产会议前，领导上应该有目的地为了解决当前生产上的关键问题，有准备的召开，而且要有详细、正确的会议建议记录，以及作出贯彻执行会议决定的具体计划，事后要检查这些决议的执行情况。只有使工人在生产会议上的建议真正发挥了实际效果，才能提高全体工作人员对生产会议的兴趣，促进企业工人创造性更进一步提高。当然，要使生产会议发挥更大的作用，企业管理的改善，企业政治思想教育的加强，劳动竞赛的深入，对开好生产会议也都有直接的关系。
    生产会议应该在党委的统一领导下，由工会负责具体领导，但决不是工会单干，要开好生产会议，需要车间和全厂行政方面的经常支持，企业行政不仅是生产会议的参加者，而且对生产会议也负有实际的领导责任。只有行政和工会共同统一的负起组织生产会议的责任来，才有可能做到精简重复的不必要的会议，减少会议次数，缩短会议时间，并使之与行政、工会的例会区别开，提高生产会议的质量，使会议决议得以贯彻执行。工会在组织生产会议的工作中，应注意研究和总结经验，以便改正缺点，把生产会议制度不断加以提高和巩固。
    随着国家工业建设的发展，群众的创造热情十分高涨，企业中劳动竞赛正日益深入，生产会议的内容也将更加丰富，更加细致和具体，它的作用也将会更加重要。因此，每个企业的领导干部，特别是工会干部，对这一工作必须引起重视，把生产会议的工作切实提高一步。
