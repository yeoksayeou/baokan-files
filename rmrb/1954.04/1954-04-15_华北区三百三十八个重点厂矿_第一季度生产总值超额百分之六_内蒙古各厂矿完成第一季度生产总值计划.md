    Xinhua News Agency Report: The 338 key state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and mines in the North China region exceeded the state plan for the first quarter of this year by 6.25 percent, an increase of 42.77 percent compared to the same period last year. According to statistics from key factories and mines in Beijing and Shanxi Province, the average daily output value in the first quarter increased by 2 to over 6 percent compared to the actual output in the fourth quarter of last year. Twenty-three major products, including pig iron, steel, steel products, electricity, coal, metal-cutting machine tools, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, flour, and paper, all overfulfilled their plans. Among them, several major products with the second-largest output in the country exceeded their quotas: coal by 6.06 percent, pig iron by 6.97 percent, and cotton cloth by 4.35 percent. Many factories and mines also completed their profit delivery plans very well. The state-owned cotton textile industry is expected to deliver over 18.7 billion yuan more in profits than planned for the entire quarter. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant saved 26.3 billion yuan in funds in the first quarter.
    The total output value of key factories and mines in the first quarter has reached 24.76 percent of the annual plan, which indicates that the factories and mines have reversed the phenomenon of being slack at the beginning and strained at the end of the year, creating a good start for the year's production. In the first quarter, due to the timely or early completion of plans by many units, production collaboration among factories and mines became even better. For example, after the Fengfeng, Fujiatan, and Taiyuan Xishan coal mines overfulfilled their production plans, they supplied the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant with sufficient coking coal, ensuring the smooth implementation of the steel production plan. Many industrial, transportation, capital construction departments, and farmers across the country have also obtained many new industrial products from North China. These include various specifications of flat steel for railway bridge projects, eight-ton road rollers for highway construction, four-purpose combination shears and punches, platform cranes, and concrete foam emulsifiers for factory and mine construction projects, roving machines, printing ingot carts, and bobbin transport carts for textile factories, seedling transplanters and five-row seeders for agricultural production, as well as grey mercerized twill, khaki drill, seersucker, and dozens of new patterned fabrics of different colors.
      In order to ensure the implementation of the Central Committee's directive that the production in the first quarter of 1954 should not be lower than the actual level of the fourth quarter of 1953, and to vigorously reverse the phenomenon of being slack at the beginning and strained at the end of the year, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee seized this issue from the first day of this year, issued instructions to Party committees at all levels, requiring all localities to vigorously overcome the complacency and relaxation that arose after the victory of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in 1953, earnestly review and revise the plans for the first quarter, continue to mobilize workers to engage in competition, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the completion of production plans by factories and mines. After the publicity and study of the general line, the socialist ideological consciousness of the workers and staff of various factories and mines has been greatly enhanced, and deeds of technological innovation have continued to emerge. From January 1 to March 16, the electric furnace steelmaking department, thin plate department, and small workshop of the rolling mill department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created 59 new records in hourly output, shift output, daily output, and smelting time; the workers of the electric furnace steelmaking department also created a new national record of smelting a furnace of steel in three hours and fifty-seven minutes in February. The workers and staff of the local state-owned Shanxi Machine Factory established a "Socialist Contribution Book" in the competition, registering their contributions to the country every day. In February alone, there were 69 rationalization proposals and tips. The young workers of 34 larger factories and mines in Beijing enthusiastically studied Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation. The group led by Li Zhenyi, a young lathe operator at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, created and improved 11 special tools, increasing production efficiency by one to five times. Around the Spring Festival holiday, the attendance rate of workers and staff in factories and mines in Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi and other places reached about 95 percent. Most factories in Tianjin completed or overfulfilled their production plans on the first day of resuming production after the Spring Festival holiday.
      [Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui Dispatch] State-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region overfulfilled this year's first-quarter production value plan by 1.44 percent. The plan completed by the entire region in the first quarter of this year exceeded both the plan and the actual completion figure for the fourth quarter of last year by a large margin, accounting for approximately 28.38 percent of this year's annual plan. Among them, the factories in Guisui City overfulfilled the plan ahead of schedule by three days, and the nine factories in Baotou City overfulfilled the plan by 12.43 percent. The figures completed by the nine factories in Baotou City were 8.82 percent higher than the total production value figures completed by the ten factories in the fourth quarter of last year, and 74.1 percent higher than in the first quarter of last year, achieving an unprecedented "all-round success." Among the region's main products, building materials completed 117.38 percent of the plan, hides and furs completed 106.59 percent, and natural mirabilite completed 138.94 percent.

    华北区三百三十八个重点厂矿
    第一季度生产总值超额百分之六
    内蒙古各厂矿完成第一季度生产总值计划
    【本报讯】华北区三百三十八个国营、地方国营和公私合营的重点厂矿，今年第一季度的生产总值超过了国家计划百分之六点二五，比去年同期提高百分之四十二点七七。据北京市和山西省两地重点厂矿的统计，第一季平均日产值比去年第四季实际提高百分之二到百分之六以上。生铁、钢、钢材、电力、煤、金属切削机床、水泥、棉纱、棉布、面粉、纸等二十三种主要产品都超额完成了计划。其中，产量占全国第二位的几种主要产品，煤超额百分之六点零六，生铁超额百分之六点九七，棉布超额百分之四点三五。很多厂矿的上缴利润计划也都完成得很好。国营棉纺织工业全季预计可比计划多缴利润一百八十七亿多元。太原钢铁厂第一季度节约了二百六十三亿元的资金。
    各重点厂矿第一季度总产值已等于全年计划的百分之二十四点七六，这就表明各厂矿已扭转了历年来生产上前松后紧的现象，为全年生产创造了良好的开端。第一季度，由于许多单位按期或提前完成计划，各厂矿之间的生产协作更趋良好。例如峰峰、富家滩、太原西山等煤矿超额完成生产计划后，供应了石景山钢铁厂和太原钢铁厂充足的炼焦煤，保证了钢铁生产计划的顺利执行。全国许多工业、交通运输、基本建设部门和各地农民，也从华北获得了不少新的工业产品。其中有供给铁路桥梁工程用的各种规格的扁钢，修建公路用的八吨压路机，厂矿建设工程用的四用联合剪冲机、平台式起重机和混凝土泡沫乳化器，纺织厂生产用的络经作业车、印花元宝车和筒子运输车，供农业生产用的移苗器和五行播种机，以及灰丝光斜纹布、米黄色华达呢、泡泡纱和几十种不同花色的新花布等。
      为保证实现中央关于一九五四年第一季度生产不低于一九五三年第四季度实际水平的指示，并大力扭转历年来生产前松后紧的现象，中共中央华北局从今年第一天起就抓紧了这个问题，向各级党委发出指示，要求各地大力克服一九五三年增产节约运动胜利后所产生的骄傲自满情绪和年初松一口气的思想，认真地审查和增订了第一季度的计划，继续发动职工进行竞赛，加强了对各厂矿完成生产计划的监督、检查工作。各厂矿职工经过总路线的宣传和学习，社会主义思想觉悟大大提高，技术革新的事迹不断涌现。国营太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部、薄板部和轧钢部小型工场，自一月一日到三月十六日，共创造了时产、班产、日产和冶炼时间的新纪录五十九次；电炉炼钢部职工并在二月份创造了三小时五十七分钟炼一炉钢的全国新纪录。地方国营山西机器厂职工在竞赛中建立了“社会主义贡献簿”，每日登记自己对国家的贡献，只二月份就出现了六十九件合理化建议和窍门，北京市三十四个较大厂矿的青年工人，热烈地学习着王崇伦的革新精神。华北农业机械总厂青年车工李振义领导的小组创造和改进了十一种专用工具，提高生产效率一倍到五倍。在春节假日前后，天津、北京、河北、山西等地厂矿职工出勤率都达到百分之九十五左右。天津市大部分工厂在春节假日后恢复生产的第一天，就完成或超额完成了当天的生产计划。
      【新华社归绥讯】内蒙古自治区国营和地方国营厂矿超额百分之一点四四完成了今年第一季度的生产总值计划。全区今年第一季度完成的计划，比去年第四季度的计划和实际完成数都超过很多，约占今年全年计划百分之二十八点三八。其中归绥市各厂提前三天超额完成了计划，包头市九个厂超额百分之十二点四三完成了计划。包头市九个厂完成的数字，比去年第四季度十个厂完成的生产总值数字还多百分之八点八二，比去年第一季度多百分之七十四点一，获得了空前未有的“满堂红”。全区主要产品中，建筑材料完成计划百分之一百十七点三八，皮毛完成百分之一百零六点五九，天然芒硝完成百分之一百三十八点九四。
