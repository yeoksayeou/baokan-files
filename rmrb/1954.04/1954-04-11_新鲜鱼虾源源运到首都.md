Fresh Fish and Shrimp Continuously Transported to the Capital

Mid-April is the season when sea fish begin to be available in large quantities. Large quantities of fresh yellow croaker, prawns, and various sea fish will be successively transported to Beijing to supply the people of the capital.

The Beijing State-owned Aquatic Products Company (now renamed the Aquatic Products Department of the Municipal Food Company) and the Beijing Cooperative General Agency Meat Wholesale Department are the main markets for fish supply. Since January of this year, they have transported large quantities of freshwater fish such as carp, crucian carp, grass carp, white fish, and silver carp from cities such as Wuxi, Hankou, Wuhu, and Baotou; and large quantities of sea fish such as yellow croaker, mullet, white shrimp, and *?* fish from Qingdao, Yantai, Tanggu, Hangu, and other places. In March alone, more than 1.38 million jin of various sea and freshwater fish were transported in, among which the large carp from Hetao, the fresh crucian carp from Guancun, Fengzhen County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the yellow croaker, prawns, and flounder from Qingdao and Yantai were the most popular among the masses.

With the improvement of people's living standards, the supply of aquatic products is constantly increasing. The average daily supply in the Beijing market in March was more than 55,000 jin, an increase of more than 78 percent compared to the average daily supply in March last year. Since April, although sea fish and prawns have been transported in continuously from various places, the supply is still felt to be insufficient to meet demand.

In the past three days, the Aquatic Products Department of the Beijing Food Company and the Beijing Cooperative General Agency Meat Wholesale Department will transport more than 245,000 jin of yellow croaker and fresh prawns by land and air, and 50,000 jin of Yellow River carp, mandarin fish, and eel. More than 2 million jin of fresh fish and shrimp will be available in April, allowing the people to eat fresh fish and shrimp.

Fish and shrimp are perishable non-staple foods. In order to better regulate the supply in the market, the Aquatic Products Department of the Beijing Food Company dug six ice cellars near Zuo'anmen last winter, storing more than 20 million jin of ice, which is enough for the Aquatic Products Department to use for the whole year. There are also more than 640 square meters of ice cellars that can temporarily store more than 200,000 jin of fish and shrimp. The Municipal Cooperative General Agency Meat Wholesale Department has also built fifteen small fish storage facilities, which can store more than 20,000 jin. In addition, they have also leased cold storage from the newly established state-owned ice factory, preparing to better regulate the supply when fresh fish and shrimp are available in large quantities.

    新鲜鱼虾源源运到首都
    四月中旬，是海鱼开始大量上市的季节，大批新鲜黄花鱼、对虾和各种海鱼将陆续运到北京，供应首都人民食用。
    北京市国营水产公司（现改为市食品公司水产部）和北京市合作总社肉食批发部是鱼类供应的主要市场。从今年一月份以来，他们就从无锡、汉口、芜湖和包头等市运来大批鲤鱼、鲫鱼、青鱼、白鱼和鲢鱼等淡水鱼；又从青岛、烟台、塘沽、汉沽等地运来大批黄花鱼、鮻鱼、白虾和?鱼等海鱼。仅三月份运进的各种海鱼和淡水鱼就有一百三十八万多斤，其中河套的大鲤鱼、内蒙古自治区丰镇县官村的鲜鲫鱼和青岛、烟台的黄花鱼、对虾、比目鱼，最受群众欢迎。
    随着人民生活水平的上升，水产品的供应量不断增长。三月份北京市场每天的平均供应量就有五万五千多斤，比去年三月份每天的供应量增加了百分之七十八以上。四月份以来，虽然各地海鱼、对虾源源运来，但仍感到供不应求。
    最近三天内，北京市食品公司水产部和北京市合作总社肉食批发部将从陆路、航路运来黄花鱼、鲜对虾二十四万五千多斤，黄河鲤鱼和桂鱼、鳝鱼五万斤，四月份就有二百多万斤鲜鱼、虾上市，让人民吃到新鲜鱼、虾。
    鱼虾是较难保管的副食品，为了更好地调剂市场的供应量，北京市食品公司水产部早在去冬就在左安门附近挖了六个冰窖，储存了二千万多斤冰块，足够水产部全年用冰。还有六百四十多平方公尺的冰窖可暂存鱼虾二十多万斤。市合作总社肉食批发部还建筑了十五个小鱼库，可以储存二万斤以上。此外还和地方国营新建制冰厂租赁了冷藏库，准备在鲜鱼虾大量上市时更好地调剂供应。
