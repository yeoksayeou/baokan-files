Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 27th: The "Pravda" published reports by Zhukov, Prishevsky, and Lazakin on the opening of the Geneva Conference on the 26th. The reporters wrote: The circumstances surrounding the beginning of the conference stand in sharp contrast to the movement of spreading pessimism and hysteria, a movement carried out by the American propaganda machine in coordination with the opening of the Geneva Conference. Those observing the development of the Geneva Conference will notice that the American delegation is making every effort to restrain its allies and force them to act entirely in the spirit of the "Cold War."

The reporters continued: Therefore, there is much talk and writing here about the possibility of a fleet of American bombers being sent to Indochina. The facts show that Dulles and some of his West European accomplices are attempting to expand the war in Indochina, rather than being concerned with a peaceful resolution of this war. This attempt is causing increasingly widespread protests. The infamous "American interests in Southeast Asia," repeatedly mentioned by American leaders, have nothing in common with the interests of peace-loving people, and this can no longer be concealed. The reporters wrote: Thus, it is understandable why the American propaganda machine is doing everything possible to spread an atmosphere of hopelessness, uncertainty, and pessimism regarding the Geneva Conference.

The American diplomatic authorities have "decreed" the failure of this conference. From the first day, they have tried to convince the world that the conference cannot achieve anything unless the free nations accept the conditions specified by Dulles. But even Dulles himself would not naively believe that a tone of command would have any effect on free people. The infamous "policy of strength" has failed every time it has been used against the countries of the democratic camp. And there is no reason to believe that it will be any different in the future.

Responsible American officials have clearly stated in their speeches that American diplomacy seeks to obstruct any agreements that could help establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korea by peaceful means, and to quickly restore peace in Indochina while ensuring the freedom and national rights of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Those who are hostile to peace have placed many obstacles in the path of resolving these tasks. However, despite these obstacles, there are also real forces that contribute to the victory of the cause of peace and the security of all nations.

The reporters concluded: The favorable characteristic of the Geneva Conference lies in the fact that representatives of all major powers are participating in the conference for the first time in recent years. This creates an important prerequisite for a smooth discussion of the agenda items. The realization of these prerequisites depends on the efforts made by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference to ease international tensions and consolidate peace.

    “真理报”记者评论日内瓦会议开幕
    指出一切大国的代表首次聚会是会议的有利特点
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：“真理报”刊载了茹科夫、普利歇夫斯基和拉萨金报道二十六日日内瓦会议开幕的消息。记者们写道：会议开始的情况与散布悲观与歇斯底里的运动形成了尖锐的对比，这一运动是美国宣传机构配合日内瓦会议的开幕而进行的。注视日内瓦会议发展经过的人们会注意到，美国代表团是竭尽力量来束缚它的盟国并强迫它们完全按照“冷战”的精神行事的。
    记者们接着写道：因此，此间关于美国轰炸机队可能被派往印度支那的消息大家谈得很多，写得很多。事实说明：杜勒斯及其西欧的一些同谋者是企图扩大印度支那战争，而不是关心这一战争的和平解决，这种企图引起极广泛的人士的日渐增长的抗议。美国领导人物所一再谈到的臭名远扬的“美国在东南亚的利益”，是与爱好和平的各国人民的利益毫无共同之处的，这一点再也掩饰不住了。记者们写道：这样，美国宣传机构为什么尽一切力量就日内瓦会议散布没有前途、没有把握和悲观的气氛，也就可以理解了。
    美国外交当局已“规定了”这次会议的失败，从第一天起他们就竭力想使全世界相信：会议不可能达到任何成就，如果自由国家的人民不接受杜勒斯所指定的条件的话。但是连杜勒斯自己也不会天真地认为：命令的口吻会对自由的人民起什么作用。臭名远扬的“实力政策”每次用于民主阵营国家，都遭到了失败。并且没有任何理由可以认为，今后会不是如此。
    美国的负责人士在自己的言论中清楚地表示，美国的外交力图阻挠达成任何这样的协议：这些协议可以有助于用和平的方法建立一个统一的、独立的、民主的朝鲜，和在保证越南、寮国与高棉人民的自由与民族权利的条件下迅速恢复印度支那的和平。仇视和平的人在解决这些任务的道路上布下了不少障碍。但是，一方面虽有这些障碍，另一方面也存在着有助于和平与各国人民安全事业胜利的现实力量。
    记者们最后写道：日内瓦会议的有利的特点就在于：一切大国的代表近些年来第一次都参加了会议。这样就为顺利地讨论议程上的问题创立了重要的前提。这些前提的实现，要看日内瓦会议的各参加国对缓和国际紧张局势、巩固和平所作的努力如何。
