Under the guidance of our Party Central Committee's policy for the construction of Anshan, and according to the state's plan, we have focused on the following three aspects of work in Anshan in recent years: (1) Constructing new factories and mines. (2) Reconstructing and expanding some factories and mines. Both newly built and rebuilt enterprises are established on new technological foundations. Our task in these newly built and rebuilt enterprises is to quickly master new technologies and new production methods. (3) Running existing enterprises well, maximizing the potential of existing equipment, and increasing labor productivity.

Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) has great potential in terms of existing equipment and labor productivity. For example, due to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the output of Ansteel's original ironmaking and steelmaking furnaces in 1953 increased by 96.8% and 34.9% respectively compared to the puppet Manchukuo period (calculated by utilization coefficient), and labor productivity increased by 67.8% and 89.4% compared to 1950. After various improvements, it can continue to increase. However, in order to unleash the production potential of existing enterprises and increase labor productivity in existing enterprises, it is necessary to further raise the awareness and enthusiasm of all personnel in the enterprise, improve the management and administration of the enterprise, raise the level of production technology, and extensively, deeply, and regularly carry out mass technical innovation movements.

Party organizations and mass organizations should guarantee and supervise the good completion of these two aspects of work, especially the work of carrying out technical innovation, because the technical innovation movement has a broad mass character and the most vivid power. It will promote the improvement of all aspects of work, become an important form of mass participation in management, become an important part of regular labor competitions, and become the best method for increasing labor productivity and reducing costs.

In Ansteel's technical innovation work in the past few years, the technological reforms suggested by Soviet experts have been of immense value. Other major technological reforms have also been achieved successfully through the diligent study of workers and staff under the assistance or inspiration of Soviet experts. Ansteel's technical innovation work, in addition to mastering the new technologies of new plants, includes the following aspects: (1) Improving equipment and tools, reducing physical labor, improving operating conditions, ensuring safe production, overcoming certain imbalances in production, and increasing labor productivity. (2) Implementing new operating methods, unleashing equipment potential, saving time, increasing quotas, and increasing output and quality. In construction and installation enterprises, the Su Changyou bricklaying method, Han Qingchen double-handed slurry application method, pre-installation, rapid welding, etc. have been promoted. In production units, the spaced mining method, furnace top adjustment for blast furnaces, rapid steelmaking, rapid steel rolling, high-speed cutting, and various rapid operations have been promoted. (3) Improving labor organization, rationally organizing labor, so that various types of work and various processes cooperate and coordinate, saving labor, shortening non-production time, and improving product quality. In this regard, various parallel assembly line methods (especially in construction and installation enterprises), division of labor and specialization, and mastery of multiple skills (such as in some maintenance and auxiliary work units) have been promoted.
(4) Adopting new technologies (such as steam blowing for blast furnaces, surface quenching, embedding hard alloys), new production operating processes (such as eliminating pre-furnace steelmaking), and new types of raw materials (such as using low-silicon iron for steelmaking and self-fluxing sintered ore for ironmaking).

From Anshan's experience in carrying out the technical innovation movement, the following four issues should be noted:

I. When technical innovations and advanced experiences first appear, they often fail to attract people's attention, and even encounter great conservative forces and resistance from old habits. Party organizations must express warm welcome to new things in their nascent state, give them strong support and encouragement, help them overcome various difficulties, criticize various conservative ideas that hinder the growth of new things, and resolutely struggle against the bureaucratic style that suppresses innovators, so that they are severely criticized both inside and outside the Party, in order to create a kind of public opinion and influence among the masses. Make innovators respected, welcomed, and supported everywhere; make conservative forces disappear; and make the broad masses of workers and staff recognize that not welcoming innovation is backward, and suppressing and ignoring it is illegal. An important task of the Party organization is to create this environment suitable for the growth of new things, encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and promote and concentrate the creative wisdom of millions of people, which will produce extremely valuable creations.

Secondly, it is not enough to simply have this environment, and this environment cannot be formed immediately. In Anshan, because this aspect of work has not been done well, some units do not warmly welcome innovators' suggestions, and phenomena such as accumulating suggestions without implementation or handling them carelessly have occurred. Some people even adopt an attitude of sarcasm and attack towards innovators, ridiculing worker innovators for wanting to be engineers, "wanting to sit in leather swivel chairs," "wanting to get rich"... thinking that the suggestions made are "nonsense," etc. Many innovators do not get support, often have many concerns, their thinking often fluctuates, and they cannot persist in their research and give up halfway. Several famous innovators in Anshan, such as Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, Li Genyuan, Huang Demao, etc., have all experienced this situation. However, the Party organization promptly discovered these innovators' ideological changes and conducted in-depth and specific education and assistance to them, so that these comrades could get help from the Party when they were in ideological distress, mustered up courage, persevered, and achieved success. It can be imagined that there must be many people whose ideological changes and difficulties encountered were not discovered by the Party organization in time, and who lost their help and support, thus causing their creations to fail or be aborted.

This in-depth ideological education and other aspects of assistance and support should not be accidental or infrequent, but should be organized by Party, mass, and administrative cadres in a planned and organized manner. There should be a certain organization, personnel, and system, as well as providing the necessary conditions and giving innovators spiritual and material guarantees.

II. Zhang Mingshan's "anti-encirclement plate," Wang Chonglun's "universal tool holder," and many other comrades' creations were not created by leadership with planned guidance, but were spontaneous. This spontaneous mass innovation movement is valuable and should be cherished. What they create is very valuable and very much needed, but this spontaneous action should and must be guided towards solving key problems and weak links in the enterprise. Therefore, enterprise leaders should, within a certain period of time, point out the direction of inventions, rationalization proposals to workers and staff, and put forward topics. And it should be included in the enterprise's technical organization measures plan. At present, we are preparing to focus on promoting the improvement of labor organization, new operating methods, and construction mechanization in construction and installation enterprises; focus on promoting mechanization, automation, and new operating methods in mines, transportation, machinery, and steel rolling plants; focus on promoting new operating methods in smelting plants; and adopt new technologies as much as possible in all departments (especially smelting departments). However, these four aspects of work cannot be absolutely separated. For example, the adoption of a certain new technology or improvement of equipment will inevitably be accompanied by the need to improve labor organization and master new operating methods, so that all technological reforms are for the purpose of increasing production, saving resources, and improving quality (including improving safety work). Mines, smelting plants, and primary rolling plants should try their best to increase production and improve quality, steel rolling plants should pay special attention to improving quality and increasing yield, and all departments should practice strict economy. This is the focus of Anshan's technical innovation at present.

Completing the above tasks cannot be achieved by relying solely on the creations and exemplary roles of a few innovators. It is necessary to carry out a mass collective technical innovation movement and rely on the cooperation and coordination of all workers and staff. In particular, it is necessary to mobilize and organize technical personnel to cooperate with veteran workers, conduct collective research, and collective creation. Efforts should be made to raise backward workers to the level of advanced workers, and reducing the role of ordinary workers is incorrect. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the collaboration between workshops, work sections, processes, and workers (attention should be paid to maintenance work sections and maintenance workers) and technical personnel, support and realize the innovative ideas of innovators, and improve the backward, to make comprehensive progress, in order to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan.

III. After the technical innovation movement changes from spontaneous to planned, and from suggestion to implementation, to the generation of huge effects on production, after solving ideological problems and policy problems, the decisive issue is organizational work. One of the administrative leaders of many of Ansteel's factories, mines, and workshops is responsible for leading this work (Party and mass organizations also have dedicated personnel responsible for this work). Special personnel and organizations are set up below, and a rationalization proposal committee is established with the participation of responsible persons from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. At the same time, it is part of the administrative functional organization, in order to cooperate with various functional organizations more conveniently and directly to handle rationalization proposal work. Mass rationalization proposal groups (or technical research groups) have been established in work sections, some have set up special research groups under the committee, and some have voluntarily formed many skill groups under the work section rationalization proposal group. From the company to the factory and workshop, there are certain systems. This ensures that the proposal and adoption of rationalization proposals are organizationally and systematically guaranteed to a certain extent. However, in many units, the work of these organizations is not frequent, and not all of them play a role, especially the lack of inspection and supervision from adoption to trial implementation, from trial implementation to regular implementation and promotion.

Any technical innovation will inevitably lead to a series of changes in operation, organization, management, and ideological habits with new creations. How to make this series of new changes adapt to the smooth development of new creations is a delicate, troublesome, and important task. In the past, we paid attention to the work of adopting workers' rationalization proposals, and paid little attention to the changes caused by the adoption and implementation of these rationalization proposals. As a result, many adopted suggestions have not been tried out for a long time, and some effective suggestions that have been rewarded have not been able to be persisted in and promoted. Therefore, we must not only continuously cultivate and educate innovators, but also do the work of the general workers who implement new technologies and cooperate, and at the same time, we must pay attention to management work (such as operating procedures, staffing, wages, quotas, spare parts... etc.) and other series of work, so that they are adapted to the promotion of new technologies. Party, mass, and administrative organizations should pay greater attention to regularly checking the implementation and promotion of suggestions, discover the reasons why they have not been able to be regularly implemented and promoted, and overcome the difficulties encountered in implementation, because our purpose is not to put forward suggestions but to implement suggestions and produce results in production. The effects produced in production and economics should become a sign of the quality of the technical innovation work.

IV. In the movement, we must focus on implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, learning new Soviet technologies, and strengthening scientific research work. It is very necessary to ask Soviet experts or scientific research institutions to conduct scientific and technological appraisals of some workers' rationalization proposals. Because the scientific and technological level of our workers and staff is not high, the suggestions they put forward often lack a scientific basis, and sometimes they may make mistakes. For example, the workers of the beneficiation plant suggested the "thick material rapid sintering method," while the Soviet experts suggested the "thin material slow sintering method." In fact, both theoretically and practically, the latter method is correct and scientific. Many suggestions need to be scientifically appraised. When Soviet experience is promoted in our enterprises, some require experiments and research, especially major technological reforms that require it, so it is very important to absorb experienced and knowledgeable technical personnel to participate and request the help of scientific institutions.

Anshan's technical innovation movement has just begun, and there are still many problems and shortcomings in the movement that need to be improved and continued to be deepened. We will enthusiastically respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and further carry out this movement so that our production can continuously increase and continuously improve on a higher technical basis to accelerate our country's socialist industrialization.

    开展技术革新运动
    中共鞍山市委书记　韩天石
    在我们党中央对鞍山建设的方针指导下，按照国家的计划，我们几年来在鞍山着重地进行了以下三方面工作：（一）建设新的工厂和矿山。（二）改建和扩建部分厂矿。无论新建和改建的企业都是建立在新的技术基础之上的，我们在这种新建和改建的企业中的任务，就是迅速掌握新技术，新的生产。（三）办好现有的企业，最大限度地发挥现有设备的潜力，提高劳动生产率。
    鞍钢现有设备和劳动生产率是有着很大潜力的，譬如，鞍钢原有的炼铁炉和炼钢炉由于学习了苏联的先进经验，他的产量一九五三年已比伪满时期的水平增加百分之九六·八和百分之三四·九（以利用系数计算），劳动生产率比一九五○年提高百分之六七·八和百分之八九·四，经过各种改进以后还可以继续提高。但是为了发挥现有企业的生产潜力和提高现有企业中的劳动生产率，这就要进一步提高企业全体人员的觉悟和积极性，改进企业的经营管理工作，提高生产技术水平，广泛地深入地经常地开展群众性的技术革新运动。
    党组织和群众团体，就应该保证和监督把这两方面工作做好，特别是把开展技术革新的工作做好，因为技术革新运动带有广泛的群众性，具有最生动的力量，它将促进各方面工作的改善，它将成为群众参加管理的重要形式，成为经常化的劳动竞赛的重要内容，成为提高劳动生产率和降低成本的最好的方法。
    鞍钢过去几年来的技术革新工作中，苏联专家所建议的技术改革的价值极大，其他较大技术改革也多是在苏联专家的帮助或启示下，经过职工努力钻研而获得成功的。鞍钢的技术革新工作，除了掌握新厂的新技术之外，包括以下几个方面：（一）改进设备和工具，减轻体力劳动，改善操作条件，保证安全生产，克服生产当中某些不均衡现象，提高劳动生产率。（二）施行新的操作方法，发挥设备潜力，节约时间，提高定额，提高产量和质量。在建筑安装企业当中推广了苏长有砌砖法，韩庆臣双手蘸浆法、预安装、快速焊接等等，在生产单位推广了间隔式采矿法，高炉的炉顶调剂、快速炼钢、快速轧钢、高速切削及各种快速操作。（三）改进劳动组织，合理的组织劳动，使各种工种各个工序之间协助配合，节约劳动力，缩短非生产时间，提高产品质量。在这方面推广了各种平行流水作业法（特别是在建筑安装企业中），分工专业和掌握多种技术（如在某些检修和辅助工作单位）等等。
  （四）采用新技术（如高炉的蒸汽鼓风、表面淬火、镶硬质合金），新的生产操作过程（如取消预备炉炼钢），新种类的原料（如低矽铁炼钢，自熔性烧结矿炼铁）。
    从鞍山开展技术革新运动的经历来看，有下面四个问题是应该注意的：
    一、技术革新和先进经验刚刚出现的时候，常常不能引起人们的注意，甚而遭到极大的保守力量和旧的习惯势力压制和反抗。党组织必须对于新生的萌芽状态的东西表示热烈欢迎，给以有力的支持和鼓励，帮助其克服各种困难，批判各种阻碍新事物生长的保守思想，坚决地向压制革新者的官僚主义进行斗争，使之受到党内外的严厉的批判，以便在群众中造成一种舆论和影响。使革新者到处受到尊敬、欢迎和支持；使保守力量消声敛迹；使广大职工都能认识不欢迎革新是落后的，压制和置之不理是不合法的。党组织的重要任务就是要造成这种适宜于新的萌芽东西生长的环境，鼓舞群众的积极性和创造性，发扬和集中千百万群众的创造智慧，这样就会产生极有价值的创造。
    其次，单是有了这个环境还是不行，而且这种环境也不可能立即形成起来。在鞍山，由于这方面工作作得并不好，有的单位对革新者的建议并不热烈欢迎，积压不执行或者草率处理的现象都曾发生。甚至有些人对革新者采取讽刺和打击的态度，讥笑工人革新者想当工程师、“想坐皮转椅”、“想发财”……认为所提建议是“瞎扯”等等。很多革新者得不到支持，往往存在许多顾虑，思想常常发生波动，不能坚持钻研，半途而废。鞍山的几位有名的革新者，如张明山、王崇伦、栗根源、黄德茂等都有过这种情况。但党组织及时发觉了这些革新者的思想变化，对他们进行了深入的具体的教育和帮助，使这些同志能在思想苦闷的时候得到党的帮助，鼓起了勇气，坚持不懈，获得了成功。可以设想：一定有不少人，党组织未能及时发觉他们的思想变化和所遇到的困难，对他们失去了帮助和支持，因而使他们的创造失败了或夭折了。
    这种深入的思想教育和其他方面的帮助和支持，不应是偶然的，不经常的，而应是组织党群干部和行政人员有计划有组织地进行这个工作，应有一定的组织、人员和制度，以及给予必要条件，给予革新者以精神和物质上的保证。
    二、张明山的“反围盘”、王崇伦的“万能工具胎”以及其他同志的许多创造并不是领导上有计划让他们创造，而是自发的，这种自发的群众性的革新运动是可贵的和应该珍惜的，他们所创造的东西很有价值，也很需要，但应该而且必须把这种自发行动引向解决企业中的关键问题和薄弱环节。因此，企业领导者就应该在一定时期里面向职工指出创造发明、合理化建议的方向，提出课题。并且应该把它纳入企业中的技术组织措施计划以内。在目前，我们准备在建筑安装企业当中着重推广改进劳动组织、新操作方法和施工机械化；在矿山、运输、机械和轧钢各厂着重推广机械化自动化和新操作方法；在冶炼各厂着重推广新操作方法；在所有各部门应尽可能地采用新技术（特别是冶炼部门），但这四方面的工作是不能绝对分开的，比如由于采用了某种新技术或改进了设备，必然伴随着要改进劳动组织和掌握新的操作方法，使所有的技术改革都是为着增产节约和提高质量（包括改进保安工作）。矿山、冶炼和初轧各厂要尽量地增产和提高质量，轧钢各厂要特别注意提高质量，提高收得率，一切部门都要厉行节约。这是目前鞍山技术革新的重点。
    完成以上的任务，不是只依靠几个革新者的创造和模范作用所能实现的，必须开展群众集体的技术革新运动，依靠全体职工的协作和配合。特别要动员和组织技术人员与老工人合作，集体研究，集体创造，要努力把落后者提高到先进者的水平，减低普通工人的作用是不对的。同时，要动员和组织各车间、各工段、各工序和工人（要注意到检修工段与检修工人）以及技术人员之间的协作，支持和实现革新者的创举，提高落后者，全面进展，以便全面超额完成国家计划。
    三、技术革新运动由自发的变成有计划的，由建议到实现、到生产上产生巨大效果，在解决了思想问题和方针问题之后，决定的问题就是组织工作。鞍钢很多厂矿、车间行政领导者之一负责领导这一工作（党群组织也有专人负责这一工作），下面设有专门人员和组织，成立了有党、行政、工会和青年团负责人参加的合理化建议委员会，同时作为行政职能机构的一部分，以便更方便地更直接地与各职能机构合作处理合理化建议工作。在工段成立了群众性合理化建议小组（或技术研究组），有的在委员会下设立了专题研究小组，有的在工段合理化建议小组下面又自愿组成了许多窍门小组。从公司到工厂、车间都有一定制度。这样就使得合理化建议的提出到采纳得到了一定的组织上和制度上的保证。但在不少单位这些组织的工作并不经常，也不是都起作用的，特别是对于采纳到试行，由试行到经常实行和推广缺乏检查和监督。
    任何一件技术上的革新必然随着新的创举引起一系列的操作上、组织上、管理上以及思想习惯上的变化，怎样使这一系列的新的变化适应新创举的顺利发展，这是一件细致、麻烦、重要的工作。在过去我们注意了采纳工人合理化建议的工作，对这些合理化建议采纳和实行以后所引起的变化很少注意，以致有不少采纳了的建议长期不能试行，有些行之有效的，已经奖励的也没有能够坚持和推广。因此我们不仅要不间断地对革新者进行培养和教育，更要做实行新的技术和配合工作的一般工人的工作，同时要注意到管理工作（比如操作规程、定员、工资、定额、备品……等等）以及其他一系列的工作，都要跟推行新的技术相适应。党群组织和行政组织要以更大的注意力经常检查建议的实行和推广的情况，发现没有能够经常实行和推广的原因，克服实行当中所遇到的困难，因为我们的目的不是提出建议而是实行建议，并且在生产上发生效果。在生产上经济上所产生的效果应当成为实行技术革新工作好坏的标志。
    四、运动当中要着重贯彻苏联专家的建议，学习苏联新技术，并且加强科学研究工作。对于有些职工的合理化建议，请苏联专家或科学研究机关进行科学技术的鉴定，是很必要的。因为我们职工的科学技术水平不高，他们提出的建议常常缺乏科学的根据，有时可能提错。比如选矿厂工人建议“厚料快行烧结法”，而苏联专家建议“薄料慢行烧结法”，实际上和理论上都证明后一种方法是正确的和科学的，很多建议需要作科学鉴定。苏联的经验在我们企业当中推行的时候有的需要进行试验和研究工作，尤其是重大的技术改革更加需要，因而吸收有经验有学识的技术人员参加和请求科学机关的帮助是非常重要的。
    鞍山的技术革新运动刚刚在开始，运动中的问题和缺点还很多，还需要努力改进和继续深入，我们将热烈地响应全国总工会的号召，更进一步开展这一运动，使得我们的生产在更高的技术基础上不断增长和不断完善，来加速我国社会主义工业化。
