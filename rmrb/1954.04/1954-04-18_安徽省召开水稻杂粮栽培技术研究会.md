In order to improve farming techniques and further increase the unit area yield of grain crops, the Anhui Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture recently held separate rice and coarse grain cultivation technology symposiums. Participants in the rice cultivation technology symposium included 369 leading production cadres at all levels from the Wuhu, Anqing, Huizhou, Lu'an, and Chuxian special districts, as well as the cities of Wuhu, Anqing, and Tunxi; technical cadres from agricultural farms, technology extension stations, and stations at all levels; and well-known agricultural production cooperative directors or representatives and experienced old farmers from various places. The rice cultivation technology symposium specifically studied issues such as appropriate close planting of rice, rational fertilization, prevention of lodging, and the promotion of a "three crops a year" system in rice-growing areas. The coarse grain cultivation technology symposium studied yield-increasing techniques for coarse grain crops such as sorghum, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and corn in coarse grain areas, identified key factors for increasing production, and also discussed yield-increasing techniques for oil crops such as sesame and peanuts.

In terms of rice cultivation, the meeting requested that representatives, after returning, seize typical examples, formulate plans, and actively and steadily promote various yield-increasing techniques, requiring agricultural production cooperative directors and mutual aid team leaders to take the lead in order to influence and promote the surrounding masses. At the same time, it is necessary to fight against conservative thinking and boldly experiment and create. In terms of coarse grain cultivation, the meeting called for changing the habit of extensive planting with low yields in the Huaibei and along-the-Huai areas. In the Huaibei and along-the-Huai areas, the proportion of the area cultivated with coarse grain crops is very large. In the future, it is necessary to start with a series of tasks such as deep plowing, fine harrowing, timely sowing, ensuring full stands, increasing fertilizer application, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, in order to increase the unit area yield of coarse grain crops.

    安徽省召开水稻杂粮栽培技术研究会
    为了改进耕作技术，进一步提高粮食作物单位面积产量，安徽省人民政府农业厅最近分别召开了水稻、杂粮栽培技术研究会。参加水稻栽培技术研究会的有芜湖、安庆、徽州、六安、滁县五个专区及芜湖市、安庆市、屯溪市的各级领导生产干部，各级农场、技术推广所、站的技术干部和各地著名的农业生产合作社社长或代表，较好的互助组组长和有经验的老农，共三百六十九人。水稻栽培技术研究会上专门研究了关于水稻适当密植、合理施肥、防止倒伏、在水稻地区推行“一年三熟”制等问题。杂粮栽培技术研究会上研究了杂粮地区的高粱、红芋、大豆、玉米等杂粮作物的增产技术，找出了增产关键，并结合讨论了芝麻、花生等油料作物的增产技术。
    在水稻栽培方面，会议要求代表们回去以后要抓住典型，订好计划，积极稳步地推行各项增产技术，要求农业生产合作社长、互助组长首先带头做起，以影响推动周围群众，同时要向保守思想作斗争，大胆试验和创造。在杂粮栽培方面，会议要求改变淮北和沿淮地区广种薄收的习惯。在淮北及沿淮地区杂粮作物栽培面积的比重很大，今后必须从深耕、细耙，适时播种，保证全苗，增施肥料及防治病虫害等一系列的工作着手，提高杂粮作物的单位面积产量。
