Strengthen Statistical Supervision and Strive to Implement the General Line
Yang Jianbai

I.

Our general line and general task during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the state and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, statistical work must be closely integrated with the socialist construction cause of the state during the transition period under the illumination of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, serving and subordinating to the needs of state management and economic construction.

Socialist economy is a planned economy. To implement a planned economy, a series of organizational work must be carried out. After the victory of the Great October Revolution, Lenin pointed out: We have seized Russia—from the rich to the poor, from the expropriators to the laborers. Now we must effectively implement management and be good at practical organizational work. He said: "Organizing statistics, supervising various large enterprises, transforming the entire national economic organization into a single large machine, into an economic organism that makes hundreds of millions of people act according to a single plan—this is the great organizational task placed on our shoulders." ("Report on War and Peace Issues")

Lenin regarded the seizure of power as the first major event of the proletarian revolution. And when the proletariat had already seized power, Lenin regarded statistics, this weapon of knowledge, as an important weapon for carrying out state management and state supervision.

The people's democratic state established in our country after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution is led by the Chinese working class through the Chinese Communist Party. The basic task of this regime is to lead the national laboring people to thoroughly complete the tasks of the democratic revolution, create conditions, and take steps to gradually eliminate the system of class exploitation and establish a completely socialist society. Therefore, in our country, it is also required to establish national statistics to comprehensively inspect and supervise the development of the national economy, and systematically reflect and study the laws of development of the national economy. That is to say, according to the needs of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to use comprehensive numerical indicators to calculate the development level, development speed, and various economic proportions of our country's national economy; to mark the continuous growth of our country's socialist economy and the various major achievements of our country's advance towards socialism; to reflect the process of restricting and transforming various non-socialist factors; to expose the anarchy and blindness that hinder and undermine socialist construction and the balance of the national economy; and to discover new potential forces that have not been utilized or fully utilized. This is used to check the implementation of the general line in a certain period and promote the further implementation of the general line. These tasks are also the political tasks of the statistical department in the struggle to implement the general line.

II.

The essence of our country's general line in the transition period is to make the socialist ownership of the means of production the sole economic foundation of our country and society. The historical task of this period is to transform our country from a backward agricultural country with underdeveloped industry into an advanced socialist industrialized country with developed industry; to transform the existing capitalist economy and small commodity economy into a socialist economy; and to expand the existing socialist economy so that the socialist economy basically becomes the only economic foundation of our country.

That is to say, during the transition period, the proportion of industry in our country will continue to rise. And among various economic components, socialist factors will continue to grow, until they gain complete dominance in the entire national economy; non-socialist factors will continue to be restricted and transformed, until they are finally eliminated. In order to implement the general line, our party and government must constantly and accurately grasp this law of production and socio-economic development. To reflect these laws depends on statistics. This requires the statistical department to deploy statistical work according to the requirements of the general line, and in general terms:

(1) In order to accurately reflect the development and changes of our country from a backward agricultural country to an advanced industrial country, the statistical department must, in the process of reproduction, calculate the development level and speed of industrial and agricultural production, and further calculate their proportional relationship, through the indicators of total industrial output value and total agricultural output value. For example, at the end of 1952, the output value of modern industry accounted for 28 percent of the total output value of industry and agriculture, which shows that our country is still a backward agricultural country at present, but it can be expected that after several five-year plans, our country can be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country.

Correctly reflecting the development level and proportional relationship of industrial and agricultural production is not only conducive to the coordinated development of industrial and agricultural production, but also a major sign of checking the degree of industrialization, and at the same time, it is the basic starting point for handling all revolutionary problems.

Of course, when observing the economic strength of a country's industry, not only should the total output value indicator be used, but also the output indicator of specific products, especially the calculation of the average production of major products per capita, to specifically observe the level of industrial development, and the speed of industrial development should not be confused with the level of industrial development.

(2) In order to accurately reflect the continuous growth of the socialist economy and the continuous restriction and transformation of the non-socialist economy, the statistical department should use indicators such as "various ownerships occupying the means of production," "total industrial and agricultural output value," "national income," "number of employees," and "commodity turnover" to specifically calculate and mark the changes in the proportion of various economic components and their interrelationships. Especially in the process of reproduction, calculating the proportion of various economic components of industry and agriculture according to the total output value on a regular basis, and calculating the proportion of various economic components of commerce according to sales on a regular basis, is particularly important for checking the continuous rise of the socialist economy and the gradual reduction and even elimination of the capitalist economy.

Stalin said: "What we need is not just any kind of industrialization. The industrialization we need is the industrialization that ensures the socialist form of industry has an increasingly higher advantage over the small commodity form, especially the capitalist form of industry. The characteristic of our country's industrialization is that it is socialist industrialization, which can ensure that the public sector in industry overcomes the private sector, that is, overcomes the small commodity economic sector and the capitalist economic sector." ("Summary Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the 16th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)") Stalin's instruction is completely in line with the actual situation in our country. For example, the proportion of state-owned industrial output value in the total output value of public and private industries has risen from 34 percent in 1949 to 50 percent in 1952. The private industry has dropped from 63 percent in 1949 to 42 percent in 1952. That is to say, although capitalist industry still accounts for a large proportion at present, it is a downward trend, while state-owned industry is developing and growing, and constantly increasing. Undoubtedly, its development must be like what Stalin said when discussing the socialist transformation of the Soviet Union: "Our country is moving towards socialism in a down-to-earth and rapid manner, pushing capitalist components behind and gradually excluding them from the national economy." ("Summary Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)")

(3) In order to meet the needs of implementing a planned economy, the statistical department must comprehensively and systematically study various proportional relationships and strengthen inspection and supervision.

We know that implementing socialist construction and socialist transformation is to rely on the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy to organize economic life.

Because the various departments of the national economy are objectively interconnected and interdependent, we "must make the plans of all production departments strictly consistent, coordinated, and form a unified economic plan." (Lenin: "The Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets") In order to link the entire national economic plan into a whole, so that the various departments of the national economy—industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, as well as culture, education, etc.—can maintain corresponding proportions and balanced development, and eliminate blindness and anarchy in the production and distribution process, it is necessary to comprehensively study the basic proportional relationships of expanded reproduction. And only after conducting this comprehensive analysis can we determine the appropriate proportional relationships of the national economy and conform to the political and economic tasks proposed by the Party and the government during the planning period.

Social production is an endless process of reproduction. All production, distribution, exchange, and consumption are links in the entire production process. In order to formulate an economic plan for expanded reproduction that conforms to objective actual needs, we must first determine the current level of national economic development, material conditions, and technical conditions, comprehensively calculate the needs of all aspects of the entire society, and comprehensively study the existing various proportional relationships, and then determine the direction, tasks, development level, development speed, and proportional relationships of the future national economy based on this. This requires the statistical department to specifically calculate and study the development level and speed of the national economy in the process of reproduction; to calculate and study the growing material and cultural needs of the laboring people; to calculate and study the various proportional relationships between production, distribution, and exchange; to calculate and study the various proportional relationships within each production department; to calculate and study the proportional relationships of regional distribution of production, etc., to provide reliable data for the preparation of plans.

Once the national economic plan has been implemented, it cannot be allowed to run its own course to complete it, but must be realized through organized leadership on the basis of systematic statistics and supervision of its implementation. Therefore, using comprehensive numerical indicators to check the implementation of the plan is the statistical department's regular and unshirkable direct task.

According to the requirements of the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, the task of checking the plan is not just to point out the percentage of completion or non-completion of the plan, but to reveal the reasons for the completion or non-completion of the plan, to reveal and prevent the occurrence of imbalances in the process of plan implementation, to discover untapped or underutilized potential forces, and to carry out an irreconcilable struggle with blindness, anarchy, and departmentalism, in order to accelerate the development of the national economy, complete and overfulfill the plan. Because the socialist economy does not allow imbalances to occur, it adopts a positive balance policy and uses methods of increasing or creating new potentials to compensate for this imbalance. And being content with blindness and anarchy is a reflection of bourgeois ideology and must be resolutely opposed.

III.

According to the above analysis, under the general line and general tasks during the transition period, what are the main tasks of our statistical work?

(1) Vigorously strengthen the statistics of the state-owned economy, with industrial statistics and capital construction statistics as the focus.

The general line is based on socialist industrialization as the main body, but it is also conditional on the corresponding development of agriculture, commerce, transportation, and social, cultural, and educational undertakings, so our statistical work must focus on industrial statistics and capital construction statistics, and correspondingly strengthen the statistics of agricultural production, commodity circulation, transportation, and social, cultural, and educational statistics, establish and improve statistics on material distribution, labor wages, financial costs, etc., in order to demonstrate the major achievements of the continuous growth of socialist factors from all aspects.

The so-called strengthening of the statistics of the state-owned economy should mainly be to establish scientific statistics, strengthen the inspection and supervision of the implementation of national plans. And accumulate regular report data, and after sorting and analysis, determine the guidelines for relevant economic activities and various economic proportional relationships, to provide a strong basis for the preparation of new plans.

The regular and main tasks of industrial and capital construction statistics should be to comprehensively check the implementation of national plans. This inspection must include all enterprises and all units, but it must focus on major enterprises and major projects. This inspection should mainly be carried out in a regular manner based on the short-term reports submitted by enterprises (monthly, ten-day, five-day, or even daily). This inspection should not only be limited to the indicators of industrial output value, output, and total investment in capital construction (which are of course the most important indicators), but should also be carried out comprehensively through indicators such as labor, materials, costs, quality, accidents, and equipment utilization. This inspection should not only be limited to answering the extent to which the plan has been completed, but should also determine which are advanced units, which are backward units, which factors promote or hinder the completion of the plan, and especially to check whether industrial production is developing proportionally according to the plan. For example, whether the means of production and consumer goods, the entire industry and the fuel industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the production of primary departments and the production of secondary auxiliary departments are balanced, and whether they are produced rhythmically and evenly on a daily, ten-day, monthly, and quarterly basis during the production process, etc.

Here, we must especially emphasize the issue of labor productivity and socialist accumulation. Socialism requires higher labor productivity than capitalism. Only by increasing labor productivity can we increase social wealth, increase national income, and increase socialist accumulation, thereby expanding capital construction. Therefore, the statistical department must put labor statistics and financial cost statistics in an important position.

Here, we must also emphasize the statistics of fixed assets and production equipment capacity.

We know that in order to realize socialist industrialization, we must develop productive forces and expand socialist reproduction. This requires, on the one hand, to fully utilize the capacity of existing enterprises, and on the other hand, to build new socialist industries. Only by establishing new industries can our country's industry, transportation, and agriculture be built on a high scientific and technological foundation, and promote our country to reach the level of industrialization at an early date. From this, it can be seen that the scale and speed of capital construction are the main signs determining the process of socialist industrialization. However, the investment amount reflecting the completion of capital construction can only explain the progress of capital construction when compared with the plan, and can only explain the growth and changes of capital construction in various historical periods when compared with various historical periods. Only the indicators of fixed assets and newly added production equipment capacity are the final results of capital construction, so only by checking the plan for the start of utilization of fixed assets and the plan for newly added production equipment capacity, and studying their dynamic series, can we accurately explain the growth and changes of social productive forces. And only by checking the proportional relationship between the growth of total investment, fixed assets, and newly added production equipment capacity in various national economic departments, especially the proportional relationship between the department producing the means of production and the department producing consumer goods, can we accurately explain whether the policy of "developing heavy industry first" has been implemented.

(2) Appropriately conduct surveys of agriculture and handicrafts, and focus on doing a good job in statistical research on the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts.

According to the Party's general line, our country's economic construction not only requires a surge in industrial economy, but also requires a certain degree of growth in agricultural economy. In order to further improve agricultural productivity, the most fundamental task of the Party in the countryside is to educate and promote the masses of peasants to gradually unite and organize, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. The specific path for this gradual socialist transformation of agriculture is the development path from mutual aid groups with socialist sprouts to agricultural production cooperatives with more socialist factors, and then to agricultural production cooperatives with a completely socialist nature.

Accordingly, our agricultural statistical work can no longer provide only general averages of agricultural production like in the past, but must study the development of agricultural production according to different agricultural production organizations, that is, according to different economic types—production cooperatives, perennial mutual aid groups, temporary mutual aid groups, and individual farmers, etc.—to conduct statistics on indicators such as cultivated land, livestock, labor force, and new agricultural tools. Then, combined with typical surveys, estimate their output and output value. Because only this type of survey and statistics can show the development and changes of mutual assistance and cooperation, and can show the continuous growth of socialist factors in the agricultural economy and its superiority. In fact, if our statistical department does not conduct such a survey and statistics, it will not be possible to cooperate with the central task in rural work and meet the needs of the Party and the government in doing a good job in leadership.

In terms of agricultural production statistics, special attention should be paid to the statistics of grain and industrial raw material crops. In addition, attention should also be paid to the survey and statistics of rural commercial grain and pre-purchased agricultural products, to provide a basis for the planned purchase of grain and other agricultural products, thereby overcoming the development of the spontaneous capitalist tendency of peasants.

Secondly, the individual handicraft industry still accounts for a large proportion in our country's national economy. This survey and statistics should mainly be carried out through typical surveys and comprehensive extrapolation methods. In particular, it is necessary to grasp the situation of increase and decrease changes through typical materials, combined with in-depth research in several important industries, to determine which industries can be maintained, which industries need to be developed, and which industries should be abolished. At the same time, it is necessary to collect statistics on the supply, production, and sales of several major products of the handicraft industry, in order to gradually guide the handicraft industry to the road of cooperatives. At the same time, we must focus on studying the development and changes of handicraft cooperation.

The cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts is a major issue related to socialist transformation, so our statistical department must put this statistical research on the important agenda. But it must be noted that for the survey and statistics of the individual economy and the semi-socialist economic forms in the process of transformation, in terms of methods and steps, we must never force orders and rush for success, but must persuade and educate, and move forward steadily.

(3) Strengthen the statistics of capitalist industry and commerce, and focus on studying the development and changes of state capitalist economy.

In order to implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, we must implement statistics and supervision on capitalist industry and commerce.

The characteristic of private capitalism is the pursuit of profit and blind development. If the bourgeoisie's essence of only seeking profit is not appropriately restricted, it will inevitably have a destructive effect on the national economy and the people's livelihood and the country's planned economic construction. Therefore, we must take practical and effective measures to give different restrictions according to the specific circumstances of each region, each period, and various industries in terms of the scope of activities, taxation, market prices, and labor conditions. That is to say, to use its aspects that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and restrict its aspects that are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood. But which are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and which are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, this must be statistically mastered in order to study and decide on various policies and measures to strengthen the leadership of private industry and commerce. From this, it can be seen that in overcoming the blindness and destructiveness of capitalism and gradually guiding it to the track of state capitalism, capitalist industry and commerce statistics are an important weapon, and we must learn and be good at using this weapon.

The first step in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state is to guide private capitalism to the track of state capitalism. State capitalism is a kind of capitalism that we can restrict and stipulate its boundaries. State capitalism under the people's democratic dictatorship in our country is a capitalist economy that is managed by the people's government, connected and cooperated with the socialist state-owned economy in various ways, and supervised by the working class. And capitalism "whether it goes to state large capitalism or goes to socialism, it is taking the same path, and it is passing through the same intermediate station—that is, the so-called 'national statistics and supervision on product production and distribution'." (Lenin: "On the Food Tax") From this, it can be seen that only after transforming private capitalism into state capitalism is it easy to implement statistics and supervision.

But state capitalism in our country has various different forms of advanced, intermediate, and low-level, so different statistical methods should be adopted for different statistical objects. At the same time, it is necessary to study the growth and changes of various different forms of state capitalist economy in order to better realize socialist transformation.

Finally, in order to make statistical work better serve the implementation of the general line, the statistical department must strengthen political and ideological leadership, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and overcome decentralism and formalism in statistical work. This requires close reliance on the leadership of the Party and the government, strengthening the collective leadership within the statistical department, and close contact between the national system and the business system and at all levels. This requires seriously studying the general line and various specific policies, carefully studying the national economic plan and the guidelines and basis for formulating the plan, and systematically learning economic knowledge, business knowledge, and statistical theory. This requires improving the specific practices of statistical work to adapt it to the political and economic tasks it undertakes, overcoming the practice of only engaging in systems, methods, calculation, and summarization, without in-depth inspection of the plan and research on the laws of the national economy (of course, in the initial stage of statistical construction, it is necessary to focus on systems and methods, and statistical work cannot relax on systems, methods, calculation, and summarization at any time). This requires launching ideological struggle against all bad tendencies through criticism and self-criticism, so that statistical work can develop healthily and better serve the realization of the general line.

    加强统计监督为贯彻总路线而奋斗
    杨坚白
    一
    我国在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，就是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。因此，统计工作必须在国家过渡时期的总路线总任务这一灯塔的照耀之下，与国家过渡时期的社会主义建设事业紧密结合，服务于并服从于国家管理和经济建设的需要。
    社会主义经济就是计划经济。而要实行计划经济，就必须进行一系列的组织工作。列宁在伟大的十月革命胜利之后即曾指出：我们已经夺得了俄国——从富人手中夺给穷人，从剥夺者手中夺给劳动者。现在我们就要有成效地实行管理，要善于实际地进行组织工作。他说：“组织统计，监督各巨大企业，把全部国家经济机构变成为一整架大机器，变成为一个使几万万人都遵照一个计划动作的经济机体，——这就是摆在我们肩上的伟大组织任务。”（“关于战争与和平问题的报告”）
    列宁是把夺取政权作为无产阶级革命的第一件大事的。而当无产阶级已经夺取了政权之后，列宁就把统计这一认识武器，作为进行国家管理和国家监督的一个重要武器了。
    我国在新民主主义革命胜利后建立起来的人民民主国家是中国工人阶级通过中国共产党来领导的，这个政权的基本任务就是领导全国劳动人民，彻底完成民主革命的任务，并创设条件，采取步骤，逐步地消灭阶级剥削制度，建立完全的社会主义社会。因而在我们的国家里，也就要求建立国家统计，对国民经济发展实行全面的检查监督，并有系统地反映和研究国民经济的发展法则。也就是说，根据社会主义建设和社会主义改造的需要，必须运用综合数字指标，把我国国民经济的发展水平、发展速度以及各种经济的比例关系计算出来；把我国社会主义经济不断增长以及我国向社会主义前进的各种重大成就标志出来；把各种非社会主义因素被限制和被改造的过程反映出来；把阻碍和破坏社会主义建设和国民经济平衡的无政府状态和盲目现象揭露出来；把未被利用和未被充分利用的新的潜在力量发掘出来。用以检查总路线在一定时期的执行情况，并推动总路线的进一步贯彻。这些任务，也就是统计部门在为贯彻总路线而斗争中的政治任务。二  
  我国在过渡时期的总路线的实质，就是使生产资料的社会主义所有制成为我们国家和社会的唯一经济基础。这个时期的历史任务，就是使我国从工业不发达的落后的农业国变为工业发达的先进的社会主义工业国；就是要把现有的资本主义经济和小商品经济改变为社会主义经济，就是扩大现有的社会主义经济，使社会主义经济基本上成为我国唯一的经济基础。
    这就是说，在过渡时期中，我国的工业比重将是不断上升的。而在各种经济成份中，社会主义因素将不断增长，一直到在整个国民经济中获得完全的统治地位；非社会主义因素将不断受到限制和改造，一直到最后消灭。为了贯彻总路线，我们的党和政府就必须经常地准确地掌握这种生产和社会经济发展的法则。而要反映这些法则就必须有赖于统计。这就要求统计部门，必须按总路线的要求来部署统计工作，从总的方面来说：
    （一）为了准确地反映出我国由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国的发展变化，统计部门就必须在再生产过程中，通过工业总产值和农业总产值的指标，按期计算工业生产和农业生产的发展水平、发展速度，并进而计算其比例关系。例如，我国在一九五二年末，现代化工业产值在工农业生产总值中占百分之二十八，它说明我国在目前仍然是一个落后的农业国，但可以预期，经过几个五年计划之后，我国就可以从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国了。
    正确地反映出工农业生产的发展水平及其比例关系，这不仅可使工农业生产协调发展，而且是检查工业化程度的主要标志，同时也是处理一切革命问题的基本出发点。
    当然，观察一个国家的工业的经济实力时，不仅仅要运用总产值指标，还要运用具体产品的产量指标，特别是要计算按人口平均的主要产品的生产量，来具体观察工业的发展水平，而且不应该把工业发展的速度和工业发展的水平混为一谈。
    （二）为了准确地反映出社会主义经济的不断增长和非社会主义经济的不断受到限制和改造的发展变化，统计部门就要运用“各种所有制占有生产资料”的指标、“工农业总产值”、“国民收入”、“职工人数”和“商品流转额”等指标来具体地计算并标志出各种经济成份的比重变化及其相互关系。特别是在再生产过程中，按期按总产值分别计算工业的和农业的各种经济成份的比重，按期按销售额来计算商业的各种经济成份的比重，这对于检查社会主义经济的不断上升和资本主义经济的逐渐缩小以至消灭的情况尤为重要。
    斯大林说：“我们所需要的并不是随便一种什么工业化。我们所需要的工业化，乃是保证社会主义形式的工业对小商品形式的，尤其是对资本主义形式的工业所占的优势愈益提高的工业化。我国工业化底特点，就在于它是社会主义的工业化，是能保证工业中的公营部分战胜私人经营部分即战胜小商品经济部分和资本主义经济部分的工业化。”（“在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”）斯大林的这一指示，对于我国的现实情况是完全符合的。例如我国国营工业产值在公私工业总产值中所占比重，已由一九四九年的百分之三十四，上升为一九五二年的百分之五十。而私营工业则由一九四九年的百分之六十三，下降为一九五二年的百分之四十二。这就是说，虽然资本主义工业在目前还占很大比重，但它是一种下降趋势，而国营工业则是发展壮大，不断增长的。毫无疑问，它的发展必然是像斯大林在论述苏联的社会主义改造时所说的：“我国是在脚踏实地和很迅速地向着社会主义迈进，把资本主义成份排挤到后面并逐渐从国民经济中排除出去。”（“在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”）
    （三）为了满足实行计划经济的需要，统计部门必须全面地有系统地综合研究各种比例关系，并加强检查监督工作。
    我们知道，实行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，就是要依靠国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则来组织经济生活。
    由于国民经济的各个部门，在客观上都是互相联系，相依为用的，因而我们“必须使所有各生产部门的计划，严格一致，协调发展，并构成一个统一的经济计划”。（列宁：“苏维埃第八次全俄代表大会”）为了要把整个国民经济计划联成整体，使国民经济的各个部门——工业、农业、交通运输业、商业以及文化教育等方面，都能保持相应的比例和平衡发展，消灭在生产和分配过程中的盲目性和无政府状态，这就必须综合研究扩大再生产的各种基本比例关系。而且也只有进行了这种全面分析之后，才能规定出国民经济的恰当的比例关系，而符合于党和政府在计划期所提出的政治经济任务。
    社会生产是一种循环无已的再生产过程。所有生产、分配、交换、消费等都是整个生产过程的一个环节。为了要拟制符合于客观实际需要的扩大再生产的经济计划，首先就要确定现存的国民经济发展水平、物质条件、技术条件，全面地计算全社会的各个方面的需要，综合地研究现存的各种比例关系，然后才能据以确定未来的国民经济的方向、任务和发展水平、发展速度、比例关系。这就要求统计部门要在再生产过程中，具体地计算和研究国民经济的发展水平、发展速度；计算和研究劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化需要；计算和研究生产、分配、交换之间的各种比例关系；计算和研究各生产部门内部的各种比例关系；计算和研究生产地域性分布的比例关系等等，为编制计划提供可靠的资料。
    国民经济计划既经付诸实施之后，它不可能是任其自流的来完成的，而是要在有系统的统计和监督其执行的基础上，通过有组织的领导来实现的。因此，运用综合数字指标，检查计划执行情况，乃是统计部门经常的责无旁贷的直接任务。
    根据国民经济有计划的按比例的发展法则的要求，检查计划的任务，并不是指出了计划完成未完成的百分比就算完事，而是要揭发计划完成未完成的原因，揭发和防止在计划执行过程中的不平衡现象的发生，发掘未被利用或未被充分利用的潜在力量，并与盲目性、无政府状态和本位主义进行不调和的斗争，以便加速国民经济的发展、完成和超额完成计划。因为社会主义经济是不允许有不平衡的现象发生的，它是采取积极平衡的方针，用增加或创造新的潜力的方法来弥补这种不平衡的。而安于盲目性和无政府状态则是资产阶级思想的反映，必须坚决反对。三    根据上面的分析，在过渡时期的总路线、总任务之下，我们统计工作的主要任务是什么呢？
    （一）大力加强国营经济统计，并以工业统计和基本建设统计为重点。
    总路线是以社会主义工业化为主体的，但它又是以农业、商业、交通运输业和社会文教事业等的相应的发展为条件的，因而我们的统计工作必须以工业统计和基本建设统计为重点，并相应地加强农业生产、商品流转、交通运输及社会文教等统计，建立和改进物资分配、劳动工资、财务成本等统计，以便从各个方面表现出社会主义因素不断增长的重大成就。
    所谓加强国营经济的统计，主要的应是建立科学统计，加强对国家计划执行情况的检查监督。并把经常的报表资料积累起来，经过整理分析，确定有关经济活动的方针和各种经济的比例关系，为编制新的计划提供有力的依据。
    工业和基本建设统计的经常的主要任务应是全面地检查国家计划的执行情况。这种检查，必须是包括所有企业、所有单位的，但它又必须是以主要企业和主要工程为重点的。这种检查，主要应是根据企业所提出的短期报表（按月、按旬、按五日、甚至是按日的）以经常的方式进行。这种检查，不能只局限于工业的产值、产量和基本建设的投资总额指标（这当然是最主要的指标），而且要通过劳动、物资、成本、质量、事故、设备运用等指标来进行全面的检查。这种检查，不应只限于回答计划完成到什么程度，而是要判明哪些是先进单位，哪些是落后单位，哪些因素助长或阻碍了计划完成，特别是要检查工业生产是否按计划规定按比例的发展。例如生产资料与消费资料，整个工业与燃料工业、机器制造工业，首要部门的生产与次要的辅助部门的生产是否平衡，以及在生产过程中是否按日、按旬、按月、按季有节奏地均衡地生产等等。
    在这里，必须特别强调一下劳动生产率和社会主义积累的问题。社会主义需要有比资本主义更高的劳动生产率。惟有提高劳动生产率，才能增加社会财富，增加国民收入，增加社会主义积累，从而扩大基本建设，因而统计部门必须把劳动统计、财务成本统计放到重要的位置。
    在这里，还必须强调一下固定资产和生产设备能力的统计问题。
    我们知道，为了实现社会主义工业化，必须发展生产力，扩大社会主义再生产。这就一方面要充分发挥现有企业的能力，而另一方面又要建设社会主义的新工业。只有建立了新工业，才能使我国的工业、运输业和农业建立在高度的科学技术的基础上面，并促使我国早日达到工业化的水平。由此可见，基本建设的规模和速度，是决定着社会主义工业化进程的主要标志。但反映基本建设完成量的投资额，当它与计划对比时，只能说明基本建设的进度，当它与各个历史时期对比时，仅能说明基本建设在各个时期的增长变化。惟有固定资产和新增生产设备能力的指标，才是基本建设的最终结果，因而惟有检查固定资产的开始利用计划和新增生产设备能力的计划，并研究其动态数列才能准确地说明社会生产力的增长变化。也惟有检查投资总额、固定资产和新增生产设备能力的增长在各个国民经济部门的比例关系，特别是在生产生产资料部门和生产消费资料部门的比例关系，才能准确地说明“首先发展重工业”的方针是否得到贯彻。
    （二）适当地进行农业和手工业的调查，并着重做好农业和手工业合作化的统计研究。
    根据党的总路线，我国的经济建设不但要求工业经济的高涨，而且要求农业经济要有一定程度的增长。为了进一步提高农业生产力，党在农村中最根本的任务就是去教育和促进农民群众逐步联合组织起来，逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。这种对农业逐步实现社会主义改造的具体道路，就是由具有社会主义萌芽的互助组，到具有更多社会主义因素的农业生产合作社，再到完全的社会主义性质的农业生产合作社的发展道路。
    据此，我们的农业统计工作，不能再像过去那样，仅仅提供笼统的农业生产的平均数，而是要按不同的农业生产组织来研究农业生产的发展，亦即按不同的经济类型——生产合作社、常年互助组、临时互助组和个体农民等等——来进行耕地、牲畜、劳动力、新农具等指标的统计。然后结合以典型调查，估算其产量、产值。因为只有这种分类型的调查统计，才能看出互助合作的发展变化，才能看出农业经济中社会主义因素的不断增长及其优越性。事实上，如果我们统计部门不进行这样的调查统计，也就不可能在农村工作方面配合中心任务，满足党和政府在做好领导工作方面的需要。
    在农业生产统计方面，应特别注意粮食和工业原料作物的统计。此外，还应注意农村商品粮和预购农产品的调查统计，给有计划收购粮食和其他农产品提供依据，从而克服农民自发的资本主义倾向的发展。
    其次，个体手工业在我国国民经济中仍占很大比重。这种调查统计主要应采取典型调查、全面推算的方法来进行。特别是要通过典型材料，结合若干重要行业的深入研究，以掌握其增减变化情况，确定那些行业可以维持，那些行业需要发展，那些行业应该取消。同时应统计手工业的若干主要产品的供、产、销情况，以便逐步把手工业生产引导到合作社的道路上来。同时要着重研究手工业合作化的发展变化。
    农业和手工业的合作化，是有关社会主义改造的重大问题，因而我们统计部门必须把这一统计研究，提到重要的日程上来。但必须注意：对于个体经济和在改造过程中的半社会主义经济形式的调查统计，在方式上和步骤上决不能强迫命令，急于求成，而是要说服教育，稳步前进。
    （三）加强对资本主义工商业的统计，并着重研究国家资本主义经济的发展变化。
    为了贯彻对资本主义工商业的利用、限制、改造政策，我们必须对资本主义工商业实行统计和监督。
    私人资本主义的特点就是追求利润，盲目发展。资产阶级这种唯利是图的本质，如不予以适当的限制，必然对国计民生和国家有计划的经济建设发生破坏作用。因而我们必须在活动范围方面，在税收方面，在市场价格方面，在劳动条件方面，依各地区、各时期、各种行业的具体情况，采取切实有效的办法，予以不同的限制。也就是说，要利用其有利于国计民生的方面，限制其不利于国计民生的方面。但究竟那些是有利于国计民生的，那些是不利于国计民生的，这就必须经过统计，掌握情况，以便据以研究与决定各种政策措施，来加强对私营工商业的领导。由此可见，在克服资本主义的盲目性和破坏性，并逐步把它引导到国家资本主义轨道中来这一工作上，资本主义工商业统计是一个重要武器，我们必须学会并善于使用这个武器。
    国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的第一个步骤，就是把私人资本主义引导到国家资本主义的轨道上来。国家资本主义就是我们能够加以限制，并规定它的界限的一种资本主义。在我国人民民主专政政权下的国家资本主义，就是在人民政府管理下、用各种方式与社会主义国营经济联系和合作的，受工人阶级监督的资本主义经济。而且资本主义“无论走向国家大资本主义或走向社会主义，都是走的同一条道路，都是经过同一个中间站口——即所谓‘对产品生产与分配上实行全民统计与监督’”。（列宁：“论粮食税”）由此可见，也惟有把私人资本主义转变为国家资本主义之后，才便于实行统计和监督。
    但我国的国家资本主义是具有高级、中级和低级的各种不同形式的，因而对于不同的统计对象，应采取不同的统计方法。同时还必须研究国家资本主义经济的各种不同形式的增长变化，以便更好地实现社会主义的改造。
    最后，为了使统计工作更好地为贯彻总路线服务，统计部门必须加强政治思想领导，开展批评与自我批评，克服统计工作中的分散主义和形式主义。这就必须紧密地依靠党、政府的领导，加强统计部门内部的集体领导，密切国家系统与业务系统及其各级之间的联系。这就必须认真学习总路线及各种具体政策，细致地研究国民经济计划及制定计划的方针和根据，有系统地学习经济知识、业务知识和统计理论。这就必须改进统计工作的具体做法，使之适应于它所负担的政治经济任务，克服那种只搞制度、方法、计算汇总，而不深入检查计划、研究国民经济规律的做法（当然，在统计建设的初期，着重搞制度方法是必须的，而且统计工作到任何时候也不能放松制度、方法、计算汇总）。这就必须对一切不良倾向，通过批评与自我批评展开思想斗争，使统计工作得到健康发展，更好地为实现总路线而服务。
