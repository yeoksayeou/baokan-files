    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 6th: In early February, when the Gobi Desert was still covered in wind and snow, many of the production wells planned for drilling this year at the Yumen Oilfield had already begun. Now, two new wells have been completed and put into production. Black crude oil gushes through pipelines from nearly 1,000 meters deep underground, pumping steadily to the oil selection station.
    This year, the Yumen Oilfield plans to produce one and a half times the amount of crude oil compared to last year. In addition to supplying the oilfield's own refinery, it will also supply the needs of certain other refineries in our country. Such a crude oil production plan cannot be met by relying solely on existing production wells; it is necessary to accelerate the drilling of many new wells to complete it.
    In January and February, when the northern foothills of the Qilian Mountains were at their coldest, the Yumen Oilfield began the construction of new wells. The civil engineering construction team quickly leveled the well sites and built roads leading to them. Seven-and-a-half-ton self-unloading trucks and rattling tractors transported equipment to the well sites day and night. Installation workers braved gales and heavy snow to erect drilling derricks over 30 meters high on time, and complete sets of oil selection stations and ground equipment for the new wells were also installed. To complete the drilling plan ahead of schedule, the drilling workers implemented a rapid drilling method. The drilling team led by labor model Liang Wende created a new national record of drilling 194.41 meters on February 28th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 5th: The petroleum exploration work in the Sichuan Basin has received strong support from a large amount of important equipment from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries. More than 1,000 tons of equipment were shipped from the Soviet Union, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries to Sichuan last year. More than 2,500 tons of equipment will be shipped this year, and all of this equipment will arrive in Sichuan in April.
    The equipment supplied to our country by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries includes large-scale deep well drilling rigs for drilling thousands of meters, automated new-style electrical measuring instruments, complete combined operation machines for oil testing, well workover rigs, well washing machines, and valuable instruments such as gravity survey instruments, magnetic survey instruments, and seismic survey instruments. These important equipment play a great role in helping our country improve the quality of petroleum exploration and accelerate the speed of exploration in the Sichuan Basin. Last year, because the petroleum exploration personnel in the Sichuan Basin had gravity survey instruments, magnetic survey instruments, seismic survey instruments, and other important instruments, they were able to use advanced geophysical exploration methods such as gravity, magnetic, and seismic methods in conjunction with surface geological surveys, making the survey work more thorough, reliable, and accurate. The high-speed drilling rigs supplied to our country by the Soviet Union and Romania have very fast drilling speeds. Last year, the drilling speed of a petroleum exploration well in the Sichuan Basin was greatly accelerated due to the use of a Romanian drilling rig, creating a new record of drilling 52.14 feet in one day.

### 玉门油矿加速钻凿新油井提高原油产量  四川石油勘探工作得到兄弟国家大力支援

    玉门油矿加速钻凿新油井提高原油产量
    四川石油勘探工作得到兄弟国家大力支援
    【新华社玉门六日电】　二月初旬，戈壁滩上还是风雪漫天的时候，玉门油矿今年计划钻凿的生产井很多已经开钻。现在，已经有两口新井钻凿完成，并且投入了生产。黑色的原油通过油管，从近一千公尺的地层深处，突突地喷送到选油站。
    今年，玉门油矿计划生产的原油为去年的一倍半，除供给本矿炼油厂使用外，还要供给我国其他某些炼油厂的需要。这样的原油计划产量，如果依靠现有生产井已经不够，必须加速钻凿很多新井才能完成。
    一、二月间，正当祁连山北麓最冷的时候，玉门油矿就开始了新井的建设工程。土木建筑工程队迅速平好井场，修好通往井场的公路；载重七吨半的自动卸货卡车、轧轧响的拖拉机，日夜不断地往井场上运送器材；安装工人们冒着狂风大雪，按时架起了三十多公尺高的钻塔，配合新井用的选油站和地面设备也一套一套的安装起来。为提前完成钻井计划，钻井工人们都实行了快速钻进法。劳动模范梁文德领导的钻井队，在二月二十八日创造了钻进一百九十四点四一公尺的全国最高新纪录。
    【新华社成都五日电】　四川盆地的石油勘探工作得到苏联和人民民主国家大批重要器材的支援。从苏联、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国等国家运到四川的器材，去年就有一千吨以上。今年还将运来两千五百多吨器材，这些器材将在四月份内全部到达四川。
    苏联和人民民主国家供应我国的器材中，包括钻数千公尺的大型深井钻探机、自动化的新式电测仪、试油用的完整的联合作业机、通井机、洗井机和重力探测仪、磁力探测仪、地震探测仪等贵重仪器。这些重要器材对帮助我国提高四川盆地的石油勘探质量和加快勘探速度起了很大作用。去年，四川盆地的石油勘探人员们，因为有了重力探测仪、磁力探测仪、地震探测仪等重要仪器，才有可能运用重力、磁力、地震等地球物理的先进探测法配合地面地质调查，使调查工作做得更为深入和确实可靠。苏联和罗马尼亚供应我国的高速钻探机，钻进速度都很快。去年，四川盆地的一座石油探井因为运用罗马尼亚钻机大大加快了钻进速度，并创造了一天钻进五十二点一四尺的最新纪录。
