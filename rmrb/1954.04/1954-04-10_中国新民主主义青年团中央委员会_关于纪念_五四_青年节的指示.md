The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
Instruction on Commemorating "May Fourth" Youth Day
April 8, 1954

This year marks the 35th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, the 5th anniversary of the birth of the China New Democratic Youth League, which inherits the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, and the second year of our great motherland's entry into planned construction.

Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of the Party and the country during the transition period to the people of the whole country, the youth and members of the League throughout the country have received a profound education, their socialist consciousness has been generally enhanced, and their labor enthusiasm for building the motherland has been widely aroused. The China New Democratic Youth League, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, must fully recognize the important responsibility brought to it by the general line, better unite the youth of the whole country, and cultivate them into staunch fighters striving to realize socialism. This requires us to mobilize the entire League and lead the youth of the whole country to respond to Chairman Mao's call of "good health, good study, and good work," exercise, study scientific knowledge, improve their political level, strengthen their concept of labor, better inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the youth to fight for socialism, give play to their initiative in daily labor, support their pioneering behavior, and lead the youth to always be at the forefront of the struggle.

In order to commemorate this year's "May Fourth" Youth Day, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League requires the League organizations in various regions to do the following tasks well:

First, earnestly guide League members and youth to greet their festival with practical actions. League organizations in factories, mines, and enterprises should mobilize all League members and lead young workers to participate in socialist labor competitions with greater labor enthusiasm and more conscious labor discipline, extensively launch technical innovation movements, create new production records, save more raw materials, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the country's production plans. League organizations in rural areas should mobilize all League members and lead rural youth to firmly establish the idea of loving agricultural labor, vigorously attract high school and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their studies to invest in agricultural production, do everything possible to improve agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and mutual aid groups, do a good job in spring plowing and production, extensively carry out the study of agricultural technology and cultural and scientific knowledge, and strive to complete this year's agricultural production tasks. League organizations in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army should mobilize all League members and lead the youth of the entire army to greatly develop the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, actively improve their military skills and political and cultural level, cultivate themselves into outstanding soldiers with both wisdom and courage and a strong physique, and vigilantly defend the socialist construction of the motherland. League organizations in schools should mobilize all League members and lead all students to consciously abide by discipline, strive for better academic achievements, respect the working people, establish a labor perspective, cultivate labor habits, and prepare to work better for the motherland. League organizations in state organs should mobilize all League members and lead young staff members of the organs to further cultivate the noble quality of serving the people diligently and conscientiously, greatly give play to their initiative and creativity in their work, and strive to improve their work and improve work efficiency. That is to say, the vast number of young people in all work positions should strive to dedicate their new creations and new progress to their festival.

Second, systematically publicize the work achievements of young people in various positions since the Second National Congress of the Youth League. Since the Second National Congress of the Youth League, the entire League, under the leadership of the Party, has guided the youth of our country to contribute great strength in participating in the labor of building a new life, and has cultivated many young advanced producers and young hero role models in various fields. League organizations in various regions should use Party newspapers, League newspapers, radio stations, and other propaganda agencies to publicize the positive performance of the Youth League in various tasks of building the motherland, publicize the Youth League's work experience in various aspects, and especially publicize advanced figures and advanced deeds among young people. Through this kind of publicity, encourage young people to study and work more vigorously. At the same time, enable the work of the Youth League to gain more understanding and help from all sectors of society.

Third, hold planned meetings of young advanced producers and young advanced workers. Such meetings should be held in cities at the city level or separately by enterprises and organs, and can also be held in counties with suitable conditions. At such meetings, responsible comrades of the Party and government are requested to make reports to the conference based on the country's construction and local conditions, combined with the problems among young people, put forward appropriate requirements to the youth, instruct them on the direction and methods of their efforts, and at the same time, the League organizations can preparedly commend and reward a group of advanced figures. This is an effective way to educate the masses with vivid examples.

Fourth, the League's grassroots organizations should carry out educational activities. On "May Fourth" Youth Day, various vivid and flexible methods can be used to carry out commemorative activities together with the youth, such as heart-to-heart talks with the theme of "What have I done for the motherland," or forums where elders tell revolutionary stories. In addition, before "May Fourth" Youth Day, under the condition of not hindering production, work, and study, some visits, picture exhibitions, meetings with combat heroes and labor models, and various cultural and sports activities can also be organized purposefully, and young people in various positions can be organized to write letters to each other.

The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League requires League committees in various regions to make practical and feasible plans and implement them after receiving this instruction.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于纪念“五四”青年节的指示
    一九五四年四月八日
    今年是“五四”运动三十五周年，是继承“五四”光荣革命传统的中国新民主主义青年团诞生五周年，是我们伟大祖国进入有计划建设的第二年。
    自从党中央和毛主席向全国人民提出党和国家在过渡时期的总路线后，全国青年和团员受到了一次深刻的教育，社会主义觉悟普遍提高，建设祖国的劳动热情广泛高涨。具有光荣革命传统的中国新民主主义青年团，要充分认识到总路线给自己带来的重大责任，更好地团结全国青年，培养他们成为实现社会主义而奋斗的坚强战士。这就要求我们动员全团并带动全国青年响应毛主席的“身体好，学习好，工作好”的号召，锻炼身体，学习科学知识，提高政治水平，加强劳动观念，更好地鼓舞青年为社会主义而斗争的爱国主义热情，发挥他们在日常劳动中的积极性，支持他们的首创行为，带领青年始终走在斗争的前头。
    为着纪念今年“五四”青年节，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会要求全国各地团的组织做好以下几项工作：
    一、认真引导团员和青年以实际行动迎接自己的节日。工厂矿山企业的团组织要动员全体团员并带动青年职工，以更高的劳动热情和更自觉的劳动纪律，参加社会主义劳动竞赛，广泛地展开技术革新运动，创造新的生产纪录，节约更多的原料，为完成和超额完成国家的生产计划而斗争。农村的团组织要动员全体团员并带动农村青年，牢固地树立热爱农业劳动的思想，大力吸引不能升学的高小和初中毕业生投到农业生产中去，尽一切力量去搞好农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社和互助组，做好春耕生产工作，广泛地开展农业技术和文化科学知识的学习，为完成今年的农业生产任务而奋斗。中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军中的团组织要动员全体团员并带动全军青年，大大地发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，积极提高自己的军事技术和政治文化水平，把自己培养成为智勇兼备、体魄健壮的优秀战士，警惕地捍卫祖国的社会主义建设。学校的团组织要动员全体团员并带动全体学生自觉地遵守纪律，争取更优良的学习成绩，尊重劳动人民，树立劳动观点，培养劳动习惯，准备更好地为祖国劳动。国家机关的团组织要动员全体团员并带动机关青年工作人员，更进一步地培养勤勤恳恳的为人民服务的高贵品质，大大地发挥工作中的主动性和创造性，为改进工作和提高工作效率而斗争。这就是说，一切工作岗位上的广大青年，都要力求用自己的新创造和新进步来给自己的节日献礼。
    二、系统地宣传青年团第二次全国代表大会以来各个岗位上的青年的工作成绩。自从青年团第二次全国代表大会以来，全团在党的领导下，引导着我国青年，在参加建设新生活的劳动中，贡献了很大的力量，并在各方面培养出了许许多多青年先进生产者和青年英雄模范人物。各地团的组织要运用党报、团报、电台等宣传机构，宣传青年团在建设祖国各项工作中的积极表现，宣传青年团在各方面的工作经验，特别是宣传青年中的先进人物和先进事迹。通过这种宣传，鼓舞青年更加生气勃勃地去学习和工作。同时，使青年团的工作得到社会各方面更多的了解和帮助。
    三、有计划地召开青年先进生产者和青年先进工作者会议。这种会议，在城市中以市或分别以企业、机关等为单位举行，在有条件的县也可以召开。在这种会议上，请党政负责同志根据国家建设和当地的情况，结合青年中的问题，向大会作报告，对青年提出适当要求，指示他们努力的方向和办法，同时团的组织可以有准备地表扬和奖励一批先进人物，这是用生动的榜样来教育群众的一种有效形式。
    四、团的基层组织要开展有教育意义的活动。在“五四”青年节可运用各种生动灵活的方式，和青年一道进行纪念活动，如以“我为祖国做了什么”为主题的谈心会，或请长辈讲革命故事的座谈会等。此外，在“五四”青年节前，在不妨碍生产、工作和学习的条件下，还可以有目的地组织一些参观，图片展览，同战斗英雄、劳动模范见面和各种文化体育活动，组织各种岗位上的青年相互写信。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会要求各地团委在接到这一指示后，作出切实可行的计划，加以贯彻。
