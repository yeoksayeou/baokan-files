Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 20th: The "Democratic Korea" published an article on the 18th entitled "The International Prestige of the People's Republic of China is Increasing Day by Day," written by Zhu Huangxie, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Cheondoist Chongu Party.

The article wrote: The economic and political achievements of the People's Republic of China have increasingly enhanced its international status, making it a powerful guarantee for peace in Asia and the world. In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have actively participated in international life and vigorously promoted the cause of world peace. In particular, during the three-year-long Korean War, the great Chinese people and the heroic Korean people worked together to make tremendous contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. Today, the People's Republic of China is one of the major countries on the international stage. All sensible people in the world know that no major issues concerning the safeguarding of international peace and security can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Many capitalist countries have already recognized the People's Republic of China. The call for respecting the status of the People's Republic of China as one of the five major powers is growing louder, especially among the people of Asia.

The article condemned the U.S. imperialists' absurd policies and actions of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, and pointed out that the arrogant actions of the U.S. ruling clique cannot stop the prosperous development of the People's China and cannot "isolate" the People's China. The United States' hostile behavior towards the People's Republic of China will only further isolate the United States itself.

Referring to the Geneva Conference, the article pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique, which is afraid of peace and unwilling to ease international tensions, is blatantly engaged in conspiracies to undermine the Geneva Conference, spreading unfounded slanders against the People's Republic of China in an attempt to diminish the role of the People's Republic of China on the international stage. However, despite this, the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is still increasing day by day.

The article said that the Korean people must further strengthen their internationalist solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people, which is forged in blood. The Korean people feel infinite satisfaction and pride that the People's Republic of China, as one of the five major powers, is participating in the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue.

The international status of the People's Republic of China today, its strength, and its peaceful policies, give world opinion, especially Asian opinion, greater expectations for its role at the Geneva Conference. The peaceful policies of the People's Republic of China, which are warmly supported and endorsed by peace-loving people all over the world, will make tremendous contributions to the cause of maintaining and consolidating world peace.

    中华人民共和国国际威望日益提高
    ——“民主朝鲜报”发表的文章的摘要
    【新华社平壤二十日电】“民主朝鲜报”十八日刊登了一篇题为“中华人民共和国国际威望日益提高”的文章，作者是北朝鲜天道教青友党中央委员会副委员长朱晃燮。
    文章写道：中华人民共和国在经济和政治上所取得的成就，使中华人民共和国的国际地位越来越提高，成为亚洲及世界和平的强有力的保障之一。中国人民在中华人民共和国成立以后的四年多时期里，积极地参加国际生活，有力地推进了世界和平事业。特别是在三年多的朝鲜战争中，伟大的中国人民和英雄的朝鲜人民一起，对亚洲及世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。今天，中华人民共和国是国际舞台上的大国之一。世界上一切有见识的人们都知道，没有中华人民共和国参加是解决不了任何有关保障国际和平和安全的重大问题的。许多资本主义国家都已承认中华人民共和国。要求尊重中华人民共和国的五大国之一的地位的呼声日益高涨，特别是在亚洲人民之中。
    文章谴责美帝国主义者敌视中华人民共和国的荒谬政策和行动，并指出，美国统治集团的狂妄行动，阻挡不住人民中国的兴隆发展，“孤立”不了人民中国。美国对中华人民共和国的敌对行为，只能进一步使美国自己孤立。
    文章在谈到日内瓦会议时指出：害怕和平、不愿意缓和国际紧张局势的美国统治集团，为了破坏日内瓦会议，正在露骨地进行着阴谋策划，在对中华人民共和国散布毫无根据的中伤，企图缩小中华人民共和国在国际舞台上的作用。但是，尽管如此，中华人民共和国的国际威望仍在日益提高着。
    文章说，朝鲜人民要进一步加强与兄弟般的中国人民的以鲜血结成的国际主义团结。朝鲜人民对于中华人民共和国作为五大国之一参加日内瓦会议讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，感到无限的满意与骄傲。
    中华人民共和国今天所处的国际地位和它的强大力量及和平政策，使世界舆论特别是亚洲舆论对于它在日内瓦会议上的作用怀着更大的期望。受着全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持与声援的中华人民共和国的和平政策，将对维护与巩固世界和平的事业作出巨大的贡献。
