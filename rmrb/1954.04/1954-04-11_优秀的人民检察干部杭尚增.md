    Excellent People's Procurator, Hang Shangzeng
    Gao Xuan
    Hang Shangzeng, Deputy Director of the First Division of the People's Procuratorate of Shaanxi Province, is a staunch fighter, infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause, and constantly fighting to safeguard the revolutionary legal system.

    In early 1950, shortly after the establishment of the People's Procuratorate of Shaanxi Province, Hang Shangzeng was transferred to work there. Like he had done in other previous positions, he earnestly devoted himself to studying the work, diligently learning, learning while doing in practice, constantly summarizing experience, and improving his professional level. He quickly developed himself into a staunch fighter who could wield the weapon of people's procuracy to fight against illegal phenomena. Because of his relatively outstanding achievements in his work, he was awarded the honorary titles of Model Communist Party Member and Model Worker.

    In September 1950, Hang Shangzeng led an inspection team to inspect the Shaanxi Provincial Prison together with relevant agencies. Because of his conscientiousness and responsibility, he discovered that imprisoned counter-revolutionaries Han Zipei, Kang Qiang, and other five major criminals (all with blood debts) were organizing prisoners to collude with outside bandits in a conspiracy to riot. Through his repeated interrogation, thorough investigation, and verification of materials, he quickly clarified the entire case, thwarted the counter-revolutionaries' conspiracy, and brought the ringleaders, Han, Kang, and others, to justice under the people's law. The timely handling of this case greatly promoted the improvement of prison work in the Northwest region at that time. When Hang Shangzeng was doing this work, he was still unfamiliar with the work, but he was able to study diligently and work hard, so he quickly improved himself.

    Hang Shangzeng can often combine procuratorial work with the central work of the Party. When Shaanxi Province carried out land reform from 1950 to 1951, Hang Shangzeng gained an important experience in the process of participating in this work: the development of procuratorial work needs to be closely combined with the central work at that time and place, and the smooth progress of the central work should be guaranteed from the procuratorial work. When he participated in the land reform in Shiquan County, Shaanxi Province, he found that the peasants' fighting spirit was not full. It turned out that the illegal landlords Mei Xianyin and Hou Guangyuan were destroying the land reform decrees and wantonly transferring property. Hang Shangzeng seized this key, verified the materials of the illegal landlords, and the procuratorate, on behalf of the state, filed a public prosecution against Mei and Hou's illegal activities to the People's Court. The People's Court punished the two illegal landlords with the law and returned all the transferred property to the peasants. Such a timely and powerful punishment of illegal landlords encouraged the peasants' fighting spirit, guaranteed the progress of land reform, and publicized the functions and tasks of the procuratorial organs through living examples.

    Hang Shangzeng often encountered various difficulties and obstacles in his struggle against illegal phenomena, but he was able to adhere to principles in the face of difficulties. In 1952, when Hang Shangzeng led a work group to Chang'an County to review the wrongly arrested and wrongly judged cases of the "Ma Nanzhuang Robbery Case" and the "Yinggou Village Robbery Case," individual cadres of the Chang'an County Public Security Bureau mistakenly thought that the work group was there to find fault and adopted an antagonistic attitude. Hang Shangzeng closely relied on the local Party and government leading organs, united the local cadres, talked to the cadres of the Public Security Bureau repeatedly, and sincerely worked with them. On the other hand, he and the work group members went deep into the villages where the incidents occurred to investigate the materials. After obtaining conclusive evidence, he used the facts to persuade and educate the local cadres, and finally reached a consensus, found that fourteen people had been wrongly judged, implemented the policies of the People's Government, and reversed the adverse effects; at the same time, he united and educated the local working cadres. At the end of the work, Zou Shaohua, deputy director of the Chang'an County Public Security Bureau, said: "This time you came to solve the problems that we had for several years. These two months are equivalent to going to school for two years."

    In his work, Hang Shangzeng has always adhered to the mass line of in-depth investigation and repeated verification. He has never easily drawn conclusions on cases based on one-sided reflections and materials, but based on the existing materials, analyzed and studied, discovered clues, and went deep into verification until the truth came out. When he was investigating the "Three Evils of Tielu" case in Tielu Town, Lintong County (the three evils were the three major tyrants of the town, Han Yuzhang, Han Bingsen, and Zhang Yangzai), he first went deep into the masses, carefully investigated, and found that the three criminals had killed more than 120 revolutionary cadres and innocent people before liberation. After liberation, the criminals opened a teahouse in Xi'an City as a cover to engage in drug production and trafficking. Based on these criminal facts, Hang Shangzeng suspected that the "three evils" might have current counter-revolutionary activities, so he continued to investigate and uncovered the "Tianshun Army" case personally planned by the Han bandits, captured 34 bandits, and seized seven rifles and pistols, eleven grenades, and seventy-nine special agent certificates. When the county held a mass public trial to deal with this case in a big way, more than 10,000 people from nearby came to participate. The County People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution according to law, and the People's Court sentenced the "three evils" to death, avenging the people's blood feuds and winning the enthusiastic support of the masses.

    Last year, the country began planned economic construction. In order to ensure the smooth progress of production and construction, the focus of the work of the First Division of the People's Procuratorate of Shaanxi Province, which Hang Shangzeng was responsible for, shifted to industrial and mining enterprises. In the face of this new and complex task, Hang Shangzeng did not bow his head, but still adhered to the principle of "learning if you don't understand." He led a work group to the factory for four months, not only learned the general knowledge of factory and mining production, but also gained preliminary experience on how procuratorial work can take root in factories and mines, providing favorable conditions for carrying out procuratorial work in factories and mines in the future.

    Hang Shangzeng was born into a poor peasant family. At the age of thirteen, he worked as a laborer and herded sheep for the landlord, suffering all kinds of oppression from the landlord. In 1935, at the age of sixteen, he joined the revolutionary work. Since joining the revolution for more than ten years, due to his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause, he has been able to respect leaders, rely on the organization, maintain close ties with the masses, sincerely unite with comrades, and correctly implement policies in whatever position he has been in. Therefore, he has been awarded the honorary titles of model and hero several times. In 1943, Hang Shangzeng was elected as a labor hero in the Great Production Movement in Yan'an; in 1948, he was elected as a combat hero in the Yan'an Prefectural Armed Work Team; in 1949, he was elected as a model Communist Party member at the Yan'an County Party Congress and won the award of "Close Ties with the Masses"; in August 1952, he was re-elected as a model Communist Party member in the People's Procuratorate of Shaanxi Province; in the same year, he was elected as a model worker. In 1953, he became an outstanding people's procuratorial worker in the Northwest Region.

    优秀的人民检察干部杭尚增
    高宣
    陕西省人民检察署第一处副处长杭尚增，是一个对革命事业无限忠诚的、不断为保障革命法制而斗争的坚强战士。
    一九五零年初，陕西省人民检察署设立不久，杭尚增就调到署里工作。他像已往在其他工作岗位上一样，老老实实地埋头钻研业务，努力学习，在实践中边学边做，不断总结经验，提高业务水平，很快地把自己锻炼成能够掌握人民检察这一武器与违法现象作斗争的坚强战士。由于他在工作中有比较显著的成绩，曾经获得了模范共产党员和模范工作者的光荣称号。
    一九五零年九月杭尚增带了检查工作小组会同有关机关检查陕西省监狱时，由于他认真负责，在那里发现了在押反革命分子韩子佩、康强等五要犯
  （都有血债）组织监犯勾结外匪阴谋暴乱的事件，经过他反复侦讯、严密调查和证实材料，很快就查清了全部案情，击破了反革命分子的阴谋，使组织暴乱的韩、康等五首犯受到人民法律的制裁。这一案件的及时处理对当时西北区监所工作的改进起了很大的推动作用。杭尚增在做这一工作时，业务还很生疏，但他能够刻苦地学习，辛勤地坚持工作，所以很快地提高了自己。
    杭尚增能够经常结合党的中心工作开展检察业务。一九五零年到一九五一年陕西省进行土地改革时，杭尚增在参加这一工作的过程中摸索到了一条重要经验：检察工作的开展需要紧密结合当时当地的中心工作，并应从检察工作方面保证中心工作的顺利进行。他在陕西石泉县参加土地改革时，发现农民斗争情绪不饱满，原来是由于不法地主梅宪银、侯光源破坏土地改革法令，肆意转移财物。杭尚增便抓住这一关键，将不法地主的材料核实，由检察署代表国家对梅、侯两人的不法行为向人民法庭提起公诉。人民法庭给两名不法地主以法律制裁，并将所转移的财物一律退还农民。这样及时有力地惩治了不法地主，就鼓舞了农民的斗争情绪，保证了土地改革工作的进行；并通过活人活事宣传了检察机关的职权和任务。
    杭尚增在和违法现象作斗争时，经常遇到各种困难和阻碍，但他都能够在困难面前坚持原则。一九五二年，杭尚增带领工作组到长安县检察错捕、错判的“马南庄抢劫案”和“营沟村抢劫案”时，长安县公安局有个别干部错误地以为工作组是来找岔子，抱着对立的态度。杭尚增紧密地依靠当地党政领导机关，团结当地干部，三番五次找公安局的干部谈话，并诚恳地和他们一起工作。另一方面，他和工作组人员都深入到肇事的村庄调查材料。在获得确凿的证据以后，他才用事实去说服教育当地干部，终于取得了一致的意见，查明错判十四人，贯彻了人民政府的政策，挽回了不良影响；而同时也团结教育了当地工作干部。工作结束时，长安县公安局副局长邹绍华说：“你们这次来给我们解决了几年的问题，这两个月时间等于上两年学校。”
    杭尚增在工作中，一贯坚持深入调查，反复对证的群众路线的工作方法，他从没有依据片面的反映和材料轻易地对案件作结论，而是根据已有材料，分析研究，发现线索，深入核对，直到水落石出才作肯定。他在检察临潼县铁炉镇的“铁炉三害”案时（三害是该镇的三大恶霸韩圉璋、韩秉森、张仰哉），首先深入群众，仔细调查，查清了三犯在解放前曾杀害革命干部和无辜群众一百二十余人。解放后，该犯等在西安市开设茶馆作掩护，从事制毒贩毒。杭尚增根据这些罪恶事实，怀疑“三害”或有现行反革命活动，便继续侦查，结果破获了韩匪亲手策划的“天顺军”案，捕获匪犯三十四名，缴获长短枪七支，手榴弹十一颗，特务证七十九张。当该县召开群众公审大会大张旗鼓地处理这一案件时，附近一万余群众赶来参加，由县人民检察署依法提起公诉，人民法院判决了“三害”死刑，给群众报了血海深仇，获得了群众热烈拥护。
    去年国家开始了计划经济建设，为了保障生产建设的顺利进行，杭尚增负责的陕西省人民检察署第一处的工作重点转向工矿企业。在这一新的复杂的任务面前，杭尚增并未低头，仍然坚持了“不懂就学”的原则。他率领工作组下厂四个月，不仅学到了厂矿生产的一般知识，而且对于检察工作如何在厂矿扎根也取得了初步经验，为今后在厂矿开展检察工作提供了有利条件。
    杭尚增出身于贫苦的农民家庭，十三岁时就给地主揽工、放羊，受尽地主的压迫。一九三五年十六岁时参加了革命工作。参加革命十几年以来，由于对革命事业的无限忠诚，他无论在那一工作岗位上，都能尊重领导、依靠组织、密切联系群众，诚恳地团结同志，正确地贯彻政策，因此曾先后数次获得了模范和英雄的光荣称号。一九四三年杭尚增在延安大生产运动中当选为劳动英雄；一九四八年在延属分区武工队当选为战斗英雄；一九四九年在中共延安县党代表大会上当选为模范共产党员，荣获“密切联系群众”的奖状；一九五二年八月在陕西省人民检察署再度被选为模范共产党员；同年被选为模范工作者。一九五三年他成为西北区优秀的人民检察工作者。
