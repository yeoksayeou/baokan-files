    Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant Workers Launch Competition to Greet "May Day"
    Changchun City Federation of Trade Unions Holds Radio Rally to Mobilize Workers to Further Develop Competition
    All the workers of the newly built Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant in Shanxi Province have enthusiastically launched a labor competition to greet the "May 1st" International Labor Day.
    Since the launch of the conservation movement in late February, waste in construction has been greatly reduced. At the same time, systems such as shift handover, drawing explanation, and regional management have been established, thereby strengthening construction management, and the workers' enthusiasm for labor has also been increasing.
    Beginning in April, the focus shifted to a labor competition centered on improving efficiency and saving funds. The plant has a large civil construction task in April. The amount of concrete pouring alone is equivalent to the total workload of the past few months. At the same time, it is also necessary to complete more than 70 percent of the installation preparation work. According to the requirements of the task, the plant mobilized workers in late March to discuss the April construction plan, and mobilized workers to consolidate existing achievements on the basis of the conservation movement, launch a labor competition, and greet the "May 1st" International Labor Day. Now, all units and groups have set competition plans and signed collective contracts, and various groups, teams, and functional departments have launched a heated labor competition. Bricklayers have broken through state quotas in the competition. The Dang Hongfa team at the boiler construction site implemented a flow-line operation method when calibrating the water-cooled wall, creating a new record of correcting 99 pipes per day, saving more than 300 man-days and saving materials worth more than 3.5 million yuan. The Gao Fushou team improved operating techniques when cutting pipes, increasing efficiency by two times and saving 6.36 million yuan. The installation workers organized a support team of more than 100 people to support the concrete workers. After three or four days of practical operation, they have learned to pour concrete. The Wang Fengcai concrete squadron maintained the excellent tradition of winter construction and continuously created new records, greatly improving the labor efficiency of concrete pouring, and creating a new record of pouring 108 cubic meters of concrete per shift. The victory of Wang Fengcai's squadron encouraged the concrete workers throughout the construction site, and the construction efficiency of the Third Concrete Squadron has been continuously improved in recent days. They put forward the slogan that the day shift should exceed the Wang Fengcai squadron, and the night shift should catch up with the Wang Fengcai squadron. Everyone is full of confidence and determined to complete the April construction task and strive to start installation in May, dedicating new labor achievements to the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

    The Changchun City Federation of Trade Unions responded to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and held a city-wide radio rally on April 12 to further launch a labor competition in the industrial, transportation, and other departments. More than 40 people, including labor models and trade union cadres, participated in the radio conference. All grassroots units organized workers to listen to the broadcast. Model units—Changchun Railway Locomotive Depot, model team—the Six-Corner Team, and labor model Song Tieshan, among others, spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to strive to create new achievements in the competition. The Changchun Railway Locomotive Depot proposed to further carry out the 500-kilometer full-load and over-axle movement, and over-fulfill the monthly plan in April as a gift to the "May 1st" Labor Day; Song Tieshan guaranteed to complete the task five days ahead of schedule in April, and to create a "sliding iron two-wheel motor" to dedicate to the "May 1st" Labor Day; The Six-Corner Team will complete the monthly task two days ahead of schedule in April, and automate all No. 5 and No. 6 corners, striving to complete the installation before "May 1st" Labor Day. Labor model Zhao Guodong and others also put forward competition conditions.
    During the conference, more than 40 reports of victory, challenges and responses, pledges, and guarantees were received from various units. (Hua Kefu)

    太原电热厂职工开展竞赛迎接“五一”
    长春市工会举行广播大会动员职工进一步开展竞赛
    山西新建太原电热厂全体职工，热烈展开劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    该厂自二月下旬展开节约运动以来，施工中的浪费现象已大为减少，同时，还建立了交接班制、讲解图纸和区域管理等制度，从而加强了施工管理，职工的劳动积极性也日益高涨起来。
    四月份开始，就转入了以提高效率、节约资金为中心内容的劳动竞赛。该厂四月份的土木建筑施工任务很大，只浇注混凝土一项，就相当过去几个月的总工作量，同时还要完成百分之七十以上的安装准备工作。该厂根据任务要求，在三月下旬就动员职工讨论了四月份的施工计划，并发动职工在节约运动的基础上，巩固已有成绩，展开劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”国际劳动节。现在各单位和小组都已订好竞赛计划，并签订了集体合同，各组、各队和职能部门已展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。砌砖工人在竞赛中突破了国家定额。锅炉工地党洪发小组在校正水冷壁时，实行了流水作业法，创造了每日校正管子九十九根的新纪录，节省人工三百多个，节省材料价值三百五十多万元。高福寿小组在割管子时，改进了操作技术，提高效率两倍，节约六百三十六万元。安装工人们组织了一个百余人的支援队，支援混凝土工人，经过三、四天的实际操作，已学会浇注混凝土。王凤才混凝土中队保持了冬季施工的优良传统，连创新纪录，使打混凝土的劳动效率大大提高，曾创造了每班浇注混凝土一百零八立方公尺的最高新纪录。王凤才中队的胜利，鼓舞了全工地的混凝土工人，混凝土三中队的施工效率连日来不断提高。他们提出日班要超过王凤才中队，夜班要赶上王凤才中队的口号。大家信心饱满，决心完成四月份的施工任务，争取五月份开始安装，把新的劳动成就献给“五一”国际劳动节。

    长春市工会联合会响应中华全国总工会的号召，在四月十二日举行了全市工业、交通运输等部门进一步开展劳动竞赛的广播大会。参加广播会的有劳动模范、工会干部等四十余人，各基层单位都组织职工收听了广播。会上有模范单位——长春铁路机务段、模范小组——六角小组和劳动模范宋铁珊等讲话，一致表示要在竞赛中争取创造新的成绩。长春铁路机务段提出要进一步开展满载超轴五百公里运动，在四月份超额完成全月计划，作为献给“五一”劳动节的礼物；宋铁珊保证四月份提前五天完成任务，并要创造一个“滑铁两轮电动机”向“五一”劳动节献礼；六角小组要在四月份提前两天完成全月任务，并使五号六角全部做到自动化，争取“五一”劳动节前安装完毕。劳动模范赵国栋等也都提出了竞赛条件。
    大会进行中间，收到了各单位的捷报、挑战和应战书、决心书、保证书等四十多份。（华可桴）
