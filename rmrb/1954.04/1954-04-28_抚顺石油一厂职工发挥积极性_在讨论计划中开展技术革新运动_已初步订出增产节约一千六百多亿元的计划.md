    Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 Workers Display Enthusiasm
    Carry Out Technical Innovation Movement During Plan Discussion
    Initially Draft Plan to Increase Production and Save More Than 160 Billion Yuan
    While discussing the national plan, workers at Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 1 launched a technical innovation movement. In the past half-month, workers have put forward many suggestions for technical innovation. The paraffin wax workshop alone submitted 46 rationalization proposals in just one week. Zhang Shushan, the head of the sweating team in the workshop, after repeated research, changed the past two sweatings to one sweating, increasing the sweating processing volume by more than one-third, and the quality fully meets national requirements. Subsequently, technician Hai Deyan studied mixing a portion of No. 2 light oil with a low freezing point (indicating a low wax content) with cold-pressed oil that has already been processed once, without processing it. This experiment has been successful, which not only reduces the dewaxing process but also produces more light oil. This single suggestion can create a wealth of more than 5.69 billion yuan for the country annually. These significant suggestions have fundamentally solved the problem of insufficient equipment capacity in the paraffin wax workshop. The East Crude Oil Workshop put forward more than 200 technical innovation suggestions in just over ten days regarding changing equipment, improving technical operation methods, and safety measures.
    In the technical innovation movement, the workers of Petroleum Plant No. 1 promoted the spirit of collectivism. The cracking team of the gasoline workshop had to burn 12 tons of residual oil every day, but the gas generated elsewhere was wasted. After worker team leader Zhang Benlian raised this issue within the team, all the workers had a heated discussion and finally proposed modifying four gas-burning "big nozzles" to utilize all the previously discarded gas. In this way, at least more than 400 million yuan can be saved each year. Zhang Peilu, technician of the West Distillation Workshop, and technicians Zhou Hao and Huang Shiyu, etc., jointly researched and improved some of the existing equipment in the workshop, increasing the processing volume by more than 33%.
    While discussing the plan and carrying out technical innovations, Petroleum Plant No. 1 also firmly grasped the important link of consolidating and promoting advanced experience. During this plan discussion, the gasoline workshop, based on the suggestion of Soviet expert Petrov to add an atmospheric evaporation tower, sent people to Petroleum Plant No. 7 to practice. They have now begun the design and other preparatory work for adding an atmospheric tower. It is estimated that after production starts in June, the gasoline yield can be increased by more than 2%; the operating cycle can be increased from the current 28 days to 40 days; and the currently large amount of accumulated petroleum coke can be made into fuel oil or road oil. This reform will bring about a major change in the production of the gasoline workshop. This year, in addition to completing the national plan, the workshop can also increase production and save 16 billion yuan more for the country.
    Petroleum Plant No. 1's discussion of the national plan with a spirit of technical innovation has greatly promoted current production. In early April, all the plant's main products overfulfilled the plan. With the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement, in addition to ensuring the completion of the national production tasks this year, the plant has initially drafted a plan to create another 163.3 billion yuan in increased production and savings for the country.

    抚顺石油一厂职工发挥积极性
    在讨论计划中开展技术革新运动
    已初步订出增产节约一千六百多亿元的计划
    抚顺石油一厂职工在讨论国家计划中，开展了技术革新运动。半个月来，职工们已提出了许多技术革新方面的建议。石蜡车间仅在一个星期内就提出了四十六项合理化建议。该车间发汗班长张树山，经过多次的钻研，把过去的两次发汗改为一次发汗，使发汗处理量提高三分之一以上，质量也完全合乎国家要求。随后技术人员海德俨又研究把一部分凝固点低（表示含蜡分少）的二号轻油，不经过处理就和已经处理过一次的冷榨油混合起来，这一试验已经成功，不仅减少了脱蜡过程，还可以多产轻质油，仅这一项建议每年即可为国家创造出五十六亿九千余万元的财富。这些重大的建议基本上解决了石蜡车间设备能力不足的问题。东原油车间在十几天里就提出了二百多件关于改变设备，改进技术操作方法和安全措施等方面的技术革新建议。
    石油一厂职工在技术革新运动中，发扬了集体主义精神。汽油车间裂化班每天要烧十二吨残油，可是在另一个地方所发生出的瓦斯都白白跑掉了。工人小组长张本连把这个问题在组内提出来以后，全组工人就展开了热烈的讨论，最后提出改装四个烧瓦斯的“大咀”，把过去扔掉的瓦斯全部利用起来。这样每年最低可以节省四亿多元。西蒸溜车间技师张培禄、技术员周浩与黄士玉等共同研究，改进了该车间的一部分旧有设备，使处理量提高百分之三十三以上。
    石油一厂在讨论计划与进行技术革新的同时，也紧紧抓住了巩固与推广先进经验这一重要环节。汽油车间在这次讨论计划中，根据苏联专家别特洛夫关于增设常压蒸发塔的建议，派人到石油七厂去实习，现在已开始进行增设常压塔的设计等准备工作，预计从六月份开始生产以后，可以使汽油收率提高百分之二以上；运转周期可以从现在的二十八天，增加到四十天；还可把目前大量积压的油焦制成燃料油或铺路油。这一改革，将使汽油车间在生产上起重大的变化。今年该车间除完成国家计划外，还可以多给国家增产节约一百六十亿元。
    石油一厂以技术革新精神讨论国家计划，对当前生产起了极大的推动作用。四月上旬全厂主要产品均超额完成了计划。随着技术革新运动的蓬勃开展，该厂今年除保证完成国家生产任务外，已初步订出了再为国家创造一千六百三十三亿元的增产节约计划。  （佟汀）
