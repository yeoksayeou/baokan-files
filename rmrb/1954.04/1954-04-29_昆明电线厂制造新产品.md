    Kunming Electric Wire Factory began small-scale production of more than ten new products in April, including mobile cables and paper-wrapped flat copper bars, to support mine construction. Among the new products produced by the factory, mobile cable is a type of power transmission equipment specifically for mines. This type of cable is wear-resistant and ensures it will not be crushed by rocks. Motor-driven mechanical equipment used in mines, such as drilling machines, combined coal mining machines, and ventilation fans in mine shafts, all require it to transmit power.

    昆明电线厂制造新产品
    昆明电线厂四月份开始小批生产移动式电缆、纸包扁铜牌等十几种新产品，支援矿山建设。该厂生产的新产品中，移动式电缆是一种矿山专用的输电设备，这种电缆能够耐磨擦，并能保证不被石头压坏，矿山上用的钻探机、矿井中的联合采煤机、通风机等用马达传动的机械设备，都必须用它输送电力。
