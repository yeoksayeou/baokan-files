    Rectify and Improve Existing Handicraft Production Cooperatives
    Since the convening of the Provincial Handicraft Representatives Conference in January 1953, Hubei Province has demarcated the boundaries between the three different relationships of master-apprentice, employer-employee, and labor-capital, giving play to the production enthusiasm of handicraftsmen, and handicraft production has developed considerably. Through the study of the general line, the awareness of handicraftsmen has been improved, and they universally demand to be organized. There are currently 213 handicraft production cooperatives in the province. The production efficiency and product quality of many handicraft production cooperatives have improved. However, due to lack of experience and leadership, some handicraft production cooperatives still have some shortcomings, mainly: low awareness of members, lack of backbones within the cooperatives, unclear tasks and purposes of running the cooperatives, rough and shoddy production, and serious capitalist tendencies in management; some violated the principle of voluntary mutual benefit during the establishment of the cooperatives, and the democratic management and other systems within the cooperatives are unsound. In order to strengthen the leadership of the province's handicraft industry to implement socialist transformation, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial handicraft work conference in February and March this year, and determined that the focus of handicraft work in the first half of this year (April, May, and June) should be on rectifying and improving existing handicraft production cooperatives; counties without handicraft production cooperatives should select promising industries to conduct key trials, learn from experience, and create conditions for the establishment of handicraft production cooperatives in the second half of the year.
    Criticize Capitalist Ideology and Improve Business Management
    Handicraft production cooperative members in various parts of Heilongjiang Province have universally examined capitalist business ideology and improved their socialist awareness in the active study of the general line. For example, Wang Shilin, a member of the Tailai County Iron Industry Production Cooperative, said: "I used to have capitalist business ideas and was unwilling to accept orders from supply and marketing cooperatives because I thought that signing contracts would result in selling for less money, which was not cost-effective. Now I realize that the source of our raw materials and the sales of our products can only be guaranteed through the supply and marketing cooperatives, and our cooperative can be run well and can meet the material needs of agricultural production in a timely manner." The members of the handicraft production cooperatives in Fuyu County examined the idea of emphasizing quantity over quality and purely pursuing profit in production last year, and made a resolution to improve quality. After studying the general line and criticizing capitalist business ideas, the handicraft production cooperatives in various places further closely integrated with the supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Suihua, Fuyu, Gannan, Baicheng, Qing'an and other counties signed production and marketing combination contracts with handicraft production cooperatives in the first quarter. Many handicraft production cooperatives, under the leadership of the local county party committees and county joint cooperatives, also conducted product quality appraisals and formulated plans to improve quality.
    Organize Handicraftsmen to Produce Farm Tools to Support Spring Ploughing
    Many counties in Yunnan Province recently convened handicraft representative meetings to publicize the general line to handicraftsmen, mobilizing them to actively produce farm tools needed for spring ploughing production to support agricultural production. When publicizing the general line to handicraftsmen, various localities guided handicraftsmen to draw a clear line between labor and exploitation, and pointed out the blindness and fragility of handicraft production through specific recollections and comparisons, so as to improve the socialist awareness of handicraftsmen; at the same time, they guided handicraftsmen to see the needs of production, especially guiding them to pay attention to the fact that farmers need more and more farm tools every day, and mobilized handicraftsmen to actively organize and take the road of cooperation, so as to produce more and better farm tools for farmers. Now, many handicraftsmen in various counties voluntarily approach supply and marketing cooperatives to sign processing contracts for the production of farm tools. For example, handicraftsmen in Qujing County signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative at the representative meeting to process 19,176 pieces of large and small farm tools, including waterwheels, hoes, plowshares, harrow teeth, and ox carts. After the handicraft representative meeting, handicraftsmen in Xuanwei County signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to process more than 854,000 pieces of iron, bamboo, wood and other farm tools.
    Actively Manufacture Various Parts for Large Industries
    Fifty-two handicraft production cooperatives in Shanghai actively manufacture parts for large industries and produce consumer goods for the people. Among the fifty-two handicraft production cooperatives, three hardware production cooperatives produce a large number of steel windows, car headlights, coolers, maintenance boxes and various machine parts for Shanghai and industrial sectors and basic construction sectors every month. The electrical wire reels, fitter's tables, heavy-duty wooden frames produced by eight carpentry production cooperatives, and the safety belts produced by leather production cooperatives are directly supplied to the needs of state-owned industries. The Shanghai Iron Bed and Vehicle Production Cooperative produced 22,500 iron beds and 1,000 pieces of medical equipment last year, some of which were sold to the Northeast, Xinjiang and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. These production cooperatives have received loan support from the National Bank and preferential treatment from state-owned commercial departments in terms of raw material supply and finished product sales, and their production has developed extremely rapidly.
    Conscientiously Implement Processing and Ordering Contracts to Ensure Quality
    Wuhan City has 70 handicraft production cooperatives, including 12 major industries such as ironware, woodenware, hardware electroplating, rattan and bamboo mattresses, sewing, knitting, weaving, dyeing, toothbrushes, shell buttons, food, and leather making. In the first quarter of this year, 58 handicraft production cooperatives accepted processing orders from basic construction and state-owned trade agencies with a total value of more than 26 billion yuan. Most of the handicraft production cooperatives, due to their conscientious implementation of processing and ordering contracts, timely delivery of goods, and guaranteed quality and specifications of products, have been praised by many processing units. Now, processing and ordering units have put forward suggestions for improvement on many products, requiring handicraft production cooperatives to further strengthen the product inspection system. These opinions have effectively helped many handicraft production cooperatives in Wuhan City to improve their business and have greatly strengthened the confidence of the members in running the production cooperatives better.
    Organize and Sever Ties with Capitalism
    The Tianjin Male Carpet Production Cooperative organized 36 carpet production groups to carry out processing and production by distributing raw materials, collecting finished products, and organizing processing. A total of more than 140 handicraftsmen participated in these groups. Most of them originally processed for private carpet firms, suffered layers of exploitation economically, and their production was very abnormal, often falling into a state of shutdown and semi-shutdown. After they were organized to process for the cooperative, they severed ties with capitalism, and production gradually became normal; the wages of general handicraftsmen have more than doubled compared with the past, and the quality of products has also been significantly improved, which shows the superiority of individual handicraftsmen embarking on the road of cooperation. For example, the 13 handicraftsmen who participated in the Chen Qinglin and Jiao Xingren groups often only had half the work before they were organized, and half of them were idle, and each person could only earn more than 100,000 yuan a month, which was not enough to maintain their lives. Now, each person can earn about 400,000 yuan a month.
    Add New Machines and Equipment to Improve Production Efficiency
    Among the 81 handicraft production cooperatives in Shenyang City, about half of the cooperatives used the public accumulation fund accumulated last year to add new machines and equipment, and the production process partially replaced heavy manual labor with machines. The national machinery industry manufactured presses for the Shenyang Iron Products Production Cooperative to replace the large hammers they used to swing by hand; and manufactured spinning machines for the miscellaneous spinning and silk thread industry cooperative to replace their hand-cranked spinning wheels. Due to the development of the national power industry, many cumbersome manual labor in Shenyang's handicraft industry can also be operated by electricity. The production efficiency of the production cooperatives that have added new equipment has been greatly improved, and the cost has also been reduced. In the past, manual spinning of silk thread required four people to spin six kilograms a day. After the change to mechanical production, two people can spin nine kilograms a day.

    积极稳步领导手工业实行社会主义改造
    整顿提高现有手工业生产合作社
    湖北省从一九五三年一月召开全省手工业代表会议以后，各地划清了师徒、雇佣、劳资这三种不同关系的界限，发挥了手工业者的生产积极性，手工业生产有了相当发展。通过总路线学习，手工业者的觉悟都有所提高，普遍要求组织起来。全省现有手工业生产合作社二百一十三个。许多手工业生产合作社生产效率和产品质量都有提高。但是由于缺乏经验，缺乏领导，有些手工业生产合作社还存在一些缺点，主要是：社员觉悟不高，社内缺乏骨干，办社的任务和目的不明确，生产中粗制滥造，经营上资本主义倾向严重；有的在建社时违背了自愿互利的原则，社内民主管理等制度不健全。为了加强领导全省手工业实行社会主义改造，中共湖北省委会今年二、三月间召开了全省手工业工作会议，确定今年上半年（四、五、六月份）的手工业工作以整顿和提高现有手工业生产合作社为主；没有手工业生产合作社的县，应选择前途大的行业，重点试办，吸取经验，为下半年建立手工业生产合作社创造条件。
  批判资本主义思想改善经营管理
    黑龙江省各地手工业生产合作社社员在积极学习总路线当中，普遍检查了资本主义经营思想，提高了社会主义觉悟。例如泰来县铁业生产合作社社员王世林说：“我过去有资本主义经营思想，不愿意接受供销合作社订货，认为订合同少卖钱，不上算。现在认识到了我们的原料来源和产品销路，只有通过供销合作社才能得到保证，我们的合作社才能办好，才能及时供应农业生产的物质需要。”富裕县各手工业生产合作社的社员们检查出去年在生产上有重数量不重质量、单纯营利的思想，并作出提高质量的决议。学习总路线和批判资本主义经营思想以后，各地手工业生产合作社更进一步和供销合作社密切结合起来。绥化、富裕、甘南、白城、庆安等县手工业生产合作社在第一季度里都和供销合作社签订了产销结合合同。很多手工业生产合作社并在当地县委和县联社领导下进行了产品质量鉴定，制订出了改进质量的计划。
  组织手工业者生产农具支持春耕
    云南省许多县最近召开了手工业代表会，向手工业者宣传总路线，动员手工业者积极生产春耕生产所需农具，支持农业生产。在向手工业者宣传总路线时，各地引导手工业者划清了劳动与剥削的界限，并通过具体的回忆对比，指出手工业生产的盲目性和脆弱性，提高手工业者的社会主义觉悟；同时，引导手工业者看见生产的需要，特别引导他们注意农民需要农具一天比一天增多的事实，动员手工业者积极组织起来，走合作化的道路，为农民生产更多更好的农具。现在，各县许多手工业者自动找供销合作社订立生产农具的加工合同。如曲靖县手工业者在代表会上和供销合作社订立了加工大小农具一万九千一百七十六件的合同，其中包括水车、锄头、犁头、耙齿、牛车等农具。宣威县手工业者在手工业代表会后，和供销合作社订立了加工八十五万四千多件铁、竹、木等农具的合同。
  积极为大工业制造各种零件
    上海市五十二个手工业生产合作社积极为大工业制造零件和生产人民生活用品。在五十二个手工业生产合作社中，三个五金生产合作社每月为上海以及工业部门和基本建设部门生产大批钢窗、汽车大前灯、冷却器、保养箱以及各种机器零件。八个木器生产合作社所生产的电线木盘、钳工桌、负重木架以及皮革生产合作社生产的保安带等，都直接供应国营工业的需要。上海铁床车具生产合作社在去年一年内生产了二万二千五百张铁床、一千件医疗器械，其中部分产品运销东北、新疆和内蒙古自治区。这些生产合作社得到国家银行的贷款支持和国营商业部门在原料供给、成品推销上所给予的优待，生产发展极为迅速。
  认真执行加工订货合同保证质量
    武汉市现有七十个手工业生产合作社，包括铁器、木器、五金电镀、藤篾棕床、缝纫、针织、织布、漂染、牙刷、贝扣、食品、制革等十二种主要行业。今年第一季度有五十八个手工业生产合作社接受基本建设和国营贸易机关等部门加工订货总值达二百六十亿元以上。大部分手工业生产合作社，由于认真执行加工订货合同、按期交货，保证了产品的质量和规格，受到许多加工单位的赞扬。现在加工订货单位对许多产品提出了改进的意见，要求手工业生产合作社进一步加强产品检验制度。这些意见有力地帮助了武汉市许多手工业生产合作社改进他们的业务，并且大大加强了社员们更加办好生产合作社的信心。
  组织起来割断与资本主义的联系
    天津市男工地毯生产合作社，用发原料、收成品、组织加工的办法，组织了三十六个地毯生产小组进行加工生产。参加这些小组的共有一百四十多个手工业者，他们原来绝大部分给私营地毯行加工，经济上遭受层层剥削，生产很不正常，经常陷于停工及半停工状态。他们组织起来给合作社加工后，割断了与资本主义的联系，生产已逐渐正常；一般手工业者的工资都比原来增加一倍以上，产品质量也有显著改进，表现了个体手工业走上合作化道路的优越性。如参加陈清林、徼兴仁小组的十三个手工业者，在没组织起来以前，经常是一半有活干，一半闲着，每人一个月只能得十几万元工资，不够维持生活。现在，每人每月能收入工资四十万元左右。
  添置新式机器设备提高生产效率
    沈阳市八十一个手工业生产合作社中，约有半数的社用去年积累的公积金添置了新式机器设备，生产过程部分用机器代替了繁重的体力劳动。国家机械工业为沈阳铁制品生产合作社制造了压力机，代替了他们手抡的大锤；为杂纺、丝线业合作社制造了纺纱机，代替了他们的手摇纺车。由于国家电力工业的发展，也使沈阳市手工业中过去许多笨重的手工劳动能够用电力操作。添置了新式设备的生产合作社，生产效率都大大提高，成本也降低了。过去手工纺丝线，四个人一天纺六斤，改为机械生产后，两个人一天能纺九斤。
