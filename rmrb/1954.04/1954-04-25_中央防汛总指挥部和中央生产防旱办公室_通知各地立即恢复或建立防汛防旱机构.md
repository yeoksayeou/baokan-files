    The Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Central Drought Prevention Office
    Notify All Localities to Immediately Restore or Establish Flood and Drought Control Organizations
    The Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Central Drought Prevention Office have issued a notice to all localities to immediately restore and establish flood and drought control organizations. The notice stated: Currently, some regions have already entered the flood season, and others are approaching it. At the same time, spring plowing has begun in all areas. Strengthening flood and drought control work is of great significance for ensuring this year's agricultural production. Therefore, all regions and river basins should immediately restore and establish flood and drought control organizations. Based on past experience, some regions have unified the two tasks of flood and drought control under one leading body, while others have separate organizations responsible for each. A few regions have only drought control organizations. This year, each region can consider and decide on its own based on its specific circumstances. However, it is important to note that these two aspects of work should be closely linked to avoid inconsistent steps or neglecting one in favor of the other. As for the flood control work for the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River, it will continue to be handled according to past practices.

    中央防汛总指挥部和中央生产防旱办公室
    通知各地立即恢复或建立防汛防旱机构
    中央防汛总指挥部、中央生产防旱办公室，通知各地立即恢复或建立防汛防旱机构。通知说：目前部分地区已进入汛期，有的地区已迫近汛期，同时各地春耕都已开始，加强防汛防旱工作，对于保障今年农业生产有着重要的意义。因此，各地区各流域应立即恢复和建立防汛和防旱机构。根据过去的经验，有的地区将防汛和防旱两项工作统一于一个领导机构，有的分由两个机构掌握，也有个别地区只有防旱机构。今年，各地区可斟酌具体情况，自行考虑决定。但必须注意，这两方面的工作应密切联系起来，避免步调不一或顾此失彼。至于黄河、淮河和长江的防汛工作，仍照过去办法办理。
