Shanxi Province has recently experienced drought conditions in many cotton-producing counties due to scarce rainfall and frequent, strong winds. To ensure the timely sowing of four million mu of cotton fields across the province, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture has issued a notice to local agricultural leadership organs to immediately strengthen efforts in conserving soil moisture, preventing drought, and seizing the opportunity to sow.

When mobilizing cotton farmers to rush sow while there is still moisture in the soil, they encountered the common thought among cotton farmers of waiting for rain and the fear that early planting would result in cold soil and poor seedling emergence. The Zhang Zhiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sudian Village, Wenxi County, Jinan, had completely prepared for sowing all 235 mu of cotton fields by April 6th. However, when the resident cadre proposed at the cooperative committee meeting that, given the scarcity of rain and insufficient soil moisture this year, they should advance the sowing schedule to take advantage of the moisture, many cooperative members disagreed with early planting. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams had prepared their cotton fields, but due to these ideological obstacles, they hesitated to sow early.

Agricultural leadership organs in cotton-producing areas, following the instructions of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture, immediately mobilized cotton farmers to seize the opportunity to sow early while there was still moisture in the soil. The Yuxiang County agricultural leadership organs dispatched a work team to start with the Chen Baihu Agricultural Production Cooperative, conducting education on "Man can conquer nature" and combining it with the transmission of advanced scientific and technological experience to overcome the cotton farmers' complacency and concerns. When specifically carrying out this work, they publicized the significance and conditions for early cotton sowing while seizing the moisture; on the other hand, they worked with cadres from the agricultural extension technology station to lead cooperative members in testing soil temperatures in the fields. After testing, it was found that the soil temperature in the cotton fields had risen to 15 degrees Celsius (generally, germination and growth are possible when the soil temperature reaches 12 degrees Celsius), thus proving that the claim of cold soil was not factual. At the same time, the work team, based on the experience of local high-yield cotton farmers, used vivid facts to illustrate the benefits of early cotton planting. After these efforts, all members of the cooperative unanimously recognized that timely early cotton planting could both increase yields and greatly reduce frost-damaged cotton. In this way, they completed the sowing of all 179 mu of cotton fields in the cooperative in six days. At the same time, under their leadership, the cotton field sowing work in the whole village was also advanced a step.

After criticizing and overcoming complacency, the movement to seize the opportunity and plant cotton early in cotton-producing areas throughout the province unfolded successively. After the Yuncheng Special District reversed the farmers' idea of waiting for rain and launched a drought-resistant sowing movement, the Qu Yaoli and Xi Zhanggeng agricultural production cooperatives in Jie County had sown more than 900 mu of cotton fields by April 12th. Xi Zhanggeng Township also launched a cotton field sowing competition between cooperatives. The Zhang Zhiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sudian Village, Wenxi County, sowed more than 50 mu of cotton fields in three and a half days. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the cotton field sowing work in various townships of Ruicheng County also successively launched a movement to seize the opportunity and sow cotton. At present, the cotton field sowing work in Yuncheng and Linfen Special Districts has been fully launched, and some townships and villages in the Jinzhong Yuci Special District have also begun to sow cotton. Everyone must ensure that the four million mu of cotton fields throughout the province are sown in a timely manner.

### 山西省农民积极抗旱抢种棉田

    山西省农民积极抗旱抢种棉田
    山西省近来由于雨少风多风大，产棉地区许多县已呈干旱现象。山西省人民政府农业厅为保证全省四百万亩棉田适时下种，特通知各地农业领导机关要立即加强保墒防旱抢墒下种工作。
    在发动棉农抢墒下种时，碰到棉农们普遍存在着等雨思想和怕早种地凉苗出不来的思想顾虑。晋南闻喜县苏店村张智清农业生产合作社在四月六日前就把全社二百三十五亩棉田的下种准备工作完全做好了，但当住村干部在社务委员会上提出今年雨少墒不足应提前抢墒下种的建议时，许多社员都不同意提早种棉。许多农业生产合作社和互助组的农民虽然都整好了棉田，但因为有这些思想阻碍着，迟迟不肯早下种。
    产棉区各地农业领导机关根据省人民政府农业厅的指示，立即动员棉农提前抢墒下种。虞乡县农业领导机关派工作组先从陈百虎农业生产合作社着手，进行“人定胜天”的教育，并结合进行传授先进的科学技术经验，以克服棉农的麻痹思想和顾虑。在具体进行这些工作时，他们一方面宣传抢墒早种棉花的意义和条件；另一方面又同农业推广技术站的干部率领社员们到地里去试验地温。经试验后知道棉田地温已增高到十五度（一般地温到十二度就可发芽生长），这样就证明地凉的说法是不合乎事实的。同时工作组又根据当地丰产棉农的经验，用活的事实说明早种棉花的好处。经过这些工作后，这个社的全体社员一致认识到适时早种棉花既能增加产量，又能大大减少霜后花。这样在六天时间里，他们就把全社的一百七十九亩棉田全部播种完毕了。同时在他们的带头下，全村的棉田播种工作也提早了一步。
    经过批判和克服麻痹思想后，全省产棉区抢墒早种棉花的运动就先后展开了。运城专区各县扭转农民等雨思想展开抗旱播种运动后，解县曲耀离、西张耿等五个农业生产合作社到四月十二日已播种棉田九百多亩。西张耿乡还展开了社与社之间的棉田播种竞赛。闻喜县苏店村张智清农业生产合作社三天半时间内即下种棉田五十多亩。芮城县各乡的棉田播种工作在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，也先后展开了抢墒播种棉花的运动。目前运城专区和临汾专区的棉田播种工作都已全面展开了，晋中榆次专区也有部分乡、村开始下种棉花，大家要保证把全省的四百万亩棉田适时播种上。
