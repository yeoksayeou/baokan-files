Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 17th: Liu Yunsheng, a young planer at the Yunnan Iron Factory, learned from Wang Chonglun's spirit of technical innovation and completed his annual production task in three months and two days.

　　Liu Yunsheng is a member of the Communist Youth League. In the first quarter of this year, he was assigned the task of processing a large number of parts such as "hexagonal bars" and "table slots". According to the old method, "hexagonal bars" had to be planed one side at a time on a planer, which was too slow. Seeing an idle milling machine in the workshop, he wanted to learn from Wang Chonglun's experience and install three-sided milling cutters on the milling machine to process these parts. His initiative was supported by the factory administration and the Party organization. With the help of technicians and veteran workers, it took several days to make the three-sided milling cutters. However, the experiment failed three times in a row. Later, based on the technician's suggestion, the advanced Soviet experience of co-directional cutting was adopted, and the experiment finally succeeded, increasing the processing efficiency of "hexagonal bars" by four times compared to the original, and the product quality also fully met the specifications. On this basis, Liu Yunsheng also proposed the suggestion of operating three machines (two planers and one milling machine) simultaneously to process parts. This suggestion was also realized with the help and support of workers. Liu Yunsheng actively learned Wang Chonglun's spirit of technical innovation in this way, continuously improving labor productivity, and on April 3, completed the production task equivalent to the whole year, calculated according to work-hour quotas.

　　Liu Yunsheng's deeds have greatly promoted the spirit of technical innovation of Wang Chonglun among the workers in Kunming City. Under his influence, Yang Zhongsheng, a member of the Yunnan Iron Factory Communist Youth League, completed two months of work in twenty days in March. Li Shaozhong, a young worker at the Kunming Drilling Machine Repair Factory, also completed his monthly task in seven and a half days.

　　Last year, Liu Yunsheng was commended by the factory's Communist Youth League leadership for his outstanding production achievements. In the increase production and practice economy campaign last year, he actively learned from the experience of the young turner Wei Yuxi in shortening auxiliary working hours, which enabled his production to exceed the quota by 60 percent, and he overfulfilled the production plan every month.

    云南铁工厂刨工刘云生发挥革新精神
    用三个月零两天时间完成全年生产任务
    【新华社昆明十七日电】　云南铁工厂青年刨工刘云生学习王崇伦技术革新精神，以三个月零两天时间完成今年全年的生产任务。
    刘云生是青年团员。今年第一季度，他担任大批“六角条”、“台槽”等零件的加工任务。按照旧的作法，“六角条”要在刨床上一面一面地刨，效率太慢。他看见车间里闲放着一台铣床，就想学习王崇伦的经验在铣床上安上三面滚刀，加工这些零件。他的创议得到了工厂行政和党组织方面的支持。在技术员和老工人帮助下，花了几天时间，三面滚刀做成了。但在试验中，曾接连失败了三次，后来根据技术员建议采用了苏联先进经验——同向切削法，终于试验成功，使“六角条”加工效率比原来提高了四倍，产品质量也完全合乎规格。在这
  一基础上，刘云生又提出同时开动三部机器（两部刨床、一部铣床）加工零件的建议。这个建议在工人帮助、支持下也实现了。刘云生就这样积极学习王崇伦技术革新精神，不断提高劳动生产率，在四月三日，按工时定额计算完成了相当于今年全年的生产任务。
  刘云生的事迹，对昆明市职工学习王崇伦技术革新精神起了很大的推动作用。在他的影响下，云南铁工厂青年团员杨忠胜，三月份以二十天时间完成了两个月的工作量。昆明钻机修造厂青年工人李绍忠也用七天半时间完成了全月任务。
    去年，刘云生就曾因突出的生产成绩受到厂里青年团领导方面的表扬。他在去年增产节约运动中，积极学习青年车工韦玉玺缩短辅助工时的经验，使生产超过定额百分之六十，月月超额完成了生产计划。
