    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Automated Thin Plate Rolling Mill Starts Partial Trial Run
    [This Newspaper Reported] Our country's first automated thin plate rolling mill has entered the stage of completion and acceptance, and partial projects have begun trial runs with electricity. On March 26, Electromagnetic Station No. 1 began a trial run of power transmission, distributing power to 15 Soviet-style motors, driving the shear to idle for four hours. The trial run results proved that the project quality was good.
    On this day, the Anshan Iron and Steel Rolling Construction Engineering Company held a mobilization meeting, requesting that the following tasks be done well: First, carry out mass quality inspections, be responsible for the project to the end, discover problems early and solve them quickly, and ensure excellent quality; Second, in the trial run, comply with quality operating procedures, trial run operating procedures, and safety regulations, and prevent slack thinking; Third, obey leadership and listen to expert advice; Fourth, implement the division of labor and responsibility system, cooperate closely, and prevent omissions.
    Employees of various construction units launched challenge competitions at the meeting. The challenge condition of the Mechanical Installation Fifth Team was: resolutely implement expert advice, do a good job of quality review, not let a single screw be missed, and do a good job of defense and security. The Electrical Installation Fourth Work Area, in responding to the challenge, proposed to ensure trial run adjustments according to the completion plan, and test run the motor one day before the trial run; and proposed four disciplines and eight points to note. Other units, such as the Metal Structure Second Team, also put forward guarantee conditions.
    At the meeting, the Party Committee Secretary of the company asked all employees to give full play to their enthusiasm, strengthen labor discipline, implement the idea of being responsible for project quality to the end, strive for the early completion of the thin plate factory, and called on Party and League members to take the lead.
    Currently, Electromagnetic Stations No. 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are preparing for trial runs. The employees are enthusiastically launching labor competitions, working selflessly for the early commissioning of the country's first thin plate rolling mill.

    鞍钢自动化薄板轧制厂局部试车
    【本报讯】我国第一座自动化薄板轧制厂已进入竣工验收阶段，局部工程已开始通电试车。三月二十六日，一号电磁站开始进行授电试车，它把电源分别送到十五台苏联式马达上，带动着剪断机空转了四小时，试运转结果证明工程质量良好。
    这一天，鞍钢轧钢建筑工程公司召开了动员大会，要求做好以下几项工作：一、开展群众性的质量大检查，对工程负责到底，及早发现问题迅速解决，保证优等质量；二、在试车中要遵守质量操作规程、试车操作规程和安全规程，防止松劲思想；三、服从领导，听从专家建议；四、贯彻分工专责制，密切配合，防止发生漏项现象。
    各施工单位职工在会上展开了挑战竞赛。机械安装第五队挑战条件是：坚决贯彻专家建议，做好质量复查工作，不让一个螺丝钉漏掉，并做好保卫和保安工作。电气安装四工区在应战时提出，要保证按竣工计划试车调整，在试车前一天将马达试转好；并提出四项纪律八项注意。其他如金属结构二队等单位也都提出了保证条件。
    会上，公司党委书记要求全体职工发挥积极性，加强劳动纪律，贯彻对工程质量负责到底的思想，争取薄板厂早日竣工，并号召党、团员起带头作用。
    目前，三、五、六、八、九号电磁站正在做试车准备工作。职工们热烈地展开了劳动竞赛，正为祖国第一座薄板轧制厂早日投入生产而忘我地工作着。
