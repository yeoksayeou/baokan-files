    Concentrating the Good Experiences of Each Cooperative and Popularizing Them Universally
    ——The Experience of Spring Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Meetings Held in Various Counties of Hebei Province
    Li Kai
    In order to further strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, mobilize various agricultural production cooperatives to complete spring plowing and production tasks, and consolidate the organization of agricultural production cooperatives, the Chinese Communist Party committees of more than 140 counties in Hebei Province successively convened mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings from late February to late March. At these meetings, experiences were exchanged, problems related to leadership, business management, and material supply of agricultural production cooperatives were centrally resolved, and the class line of the Party's work in rural areas was discussed in light of the actual situation. Generally, these meetings were relatively successful.
    Judging from the experience of various localities in holding this meeting, to hold a successful mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the specific situation and problems of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in advance, so that the leadership's thinking is clear and there is a clear understanding of the situation.
    Various counties adopted the methods of general understanding and typical investigation to classify and rank all agricultural production cooperatives in the county, clarify the situation, and grasp the problems. Generally, before the meeting, counties organized three to four work groups, headed by leading cadres, to conduct巡回inspections in various districts, and made specific analyses of the situation of each cooperative based on the materials they had掌握. The results of the inspection were: most cooperatives can be consolidated and can be run well, but there are also many problems that must be solved. The main ones are: (1) The Party's class line in rural work has not been thoroughly implemented, and many of the backbones of the cooperatives lack a clear class viewpoint. Some thought that rich peasants could write accounts and had good production conditions, so they absorbed rich peasants into the cooperatives; some thought that poor peasants had thin land and no farm tools, and joining the cooperatives was to "get a piece of the action," so they excluded and discriminated against them; some also reduced the prices of middle peasants' livestock and farm tools when assessing their value for the cooperatives, infringing on the interests of the middle peasants; and there also appeared many cooperatives with only middle peasants or only poor peasants participating. (2) The management方針of some cooperatives is incorrect, attaching importance to sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture, and relying on public loans to set up large stalls. They did not have enough understanding of the great potential in agriculture, and did not seek ways to increase production in agriculture. Some cooperatives did not formulate production plans; some cooperatives did订the plan but it was also formalistic, and they were not sure whether production could be increased, so the members were worried that their income could not be increased and their morale was unstable. In terms of labor organization, some cooperatives still used the old ways of mutual aid teams, assigning work temporarily, evaluating work temporarily, and recording work, which caused a relatively serious waste of labor. (3) After a large number of new cooperatives were developed, the cadres of the new cooperatives were very enthusiastic, but lacked experience in running cooperatives. When they encountered problems, they could not solve them, and their morale was low. (4) The material supply work could not keep up, and the combination of the three types of cooperatives was not done well. Some members lacked food and production materials, and could not produce well.
    Before holding the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, it is also necessary to do a good job of cultivating typical examples. The CCP Central Committee's decision on developing agricultural production cooperatives pointed out: "Party committees at all levels should make regular convening of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings and agricultural technology meetings, as well as various座谈会and other forms, an important method of educating the masses and cadres. The main content of the representative meeting should be to exchange experience…conduct ideological and political education, mobilize to complete tasks, and thereby promote the development of agricultural mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives." Exchanging experience is the main content of convening a representative meeting, so you cannot just have leaders talking and the masses listening; you must use the method of concentrating the experience of the masses to educate the masses. In order to achieve purposeful exchange of experience with leadership, it is necessary to do a good job of cultivating typical examples. The counties of Hebei Province selected ten to twenty typical examples before the meeting to carry out cultivation work. These typical examples were all selected based on the problems to be solved by the meeting. One method is to send people to the cooperative to cultivate based on the daily understanding of the situation; another method is to discover typical examples and cultivate them at any time during the meeting by presenting the situation and asking questions. These typical examples cannot be required to be good in all aspects, as long as they have something that everyone can learn from in one aspect. Several typical examples added together can relatively fully exchange experiences in various aspects.
    At the mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings in various counties, the reports made by the leadership were relatively brief and clear, and the main effort was put on organizing typical speeches. First concentrate on several typical speeches to solve a problem; after the report, organize the attending representatives to discuss in light of the actual situation of their own cooperatives. Using this method, generally speaking, the problems are solved thoroughly.
    After the reports of the leading comrades and the speeches of the typical figures, the representatives further clearly understood the Party's class line in rural work. The representative of a cooperative in Dayangzhuang, Li County, said in his typical speech: Their cooperative was not警惕enough against exploiters, and absorbed rich peasants into the cooperative; after the rich peasants joined the cooperative, they挑拨社within the cooperative in many ways, exploited the poor members, and almost brought the cooperative down. They clearly realized: if they are not cleaned out, the cooperative cannot be consolidated. This vivid fact raised the class警觉of the attending representatives. After discussion, everyone determined to use the method of recollection and comparison to enlighten the consciousness of the members,清洗the rich peasants, exploiters, and other reactionaries, and maintain the organizational purity of the cooperative. Regarding the issue of relying on the solid alliance of poor peasants and middle peasants, after a typical report was made at the representative meeting in Xingtai County, the representatives launched a heated discussion. Cui Zhiqi of Beiyangtong Village said: "I used to think that poor peasants were bottomless pits, and we stipulated that the farm tools and livestock to be worth at least 3 million yuan to join the cooperative, and if they were not enough, they should not join the cooperative. This is really losing our position. I will definitely talk to the poor peasants when I go back, and as long as they are willing to join the cooperative, I will absorb them." Some representatives also检讨the deviation of their cooperative in infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and they will solve the problem of unreasonable prices of livestock and farm tools when joining the cooperative after going back. If there are middle peasants and poor peasants organizing cooperatives separately in a village, they can temporarily remain unchanged, but they must stipulate reasonable prices,互调farm tools and labor, and strengthen contact to consolidate the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants.
    In terms of business management, after typical speeches and group discussions at the county level, it was more clearly recognized that doing a good job in agricultural production, increasing yields, and increasing the income of members were important keys to consolidating and improving the cooperative. At the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting in Xingtai County, representative Wang Wanzao introduced the experience and lessons of their cooperative. Last year, their cooperative thought that "agriculture had no big development," and operated a large number of businesses and sideline occupations. Of the 62 laborers in the cooperative, 43 were drawn out to operate commercial stores, run merchants, and other businesses, as well as oil mills, flower mills, and other sideline occupations. The hemp cakes from the oil mill were not施to the fields, and laborers were drawn out to sell charcoal when weeding; as a result, crops were reduced, members' thinking was chaotic, and 23 households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. After studying the general line, the direction of progress was clarified, and it was determined to focus on agriculture. Fifty acres of land have been修整, and it is estimated that more than 10,000 catties of peanuts can be increased; they also plan to repair 200 acres of land, repair 100 acres of梯田, and turn 30 acres of dry land into paddy fields in five years. The members all supported this operating方針, and the cooperative was consolidated.
    At the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting in Ba County, representative Li Yaobin introduced the lesson of their cooperative relying on national loans, blindly investing, increasing production but not increasing income. Representative Wang Chengxu said after listening to this speech: "Originally, our cooperative planned to borrow 10 million yuan to set up a big stall; this time it has educated me. If not, I don't know what it would have turned out in the fall." Many cooperative representatives corrected the idea of blind investment. The idea of精打细算was established. The 24 cooperatives in the fifth district originally planned to borrow 103 million yuan, which was reduced to 56.9 million yuan.
    On the basis of clarifying the operating方針and drawing a clear line with capitalism, the leadership of each county further guided the representatives to find ways to increase production in agriculture. Chen Rui, representative of the Chen Rui cooperative in Mancheng County, said that according to their own conditions, their cooperative found nine ways to increase production, such as digging wells to expand paddy fields, improving soil, and improving technology, which can increase production by more than 12,000 catties of grain compared to the original plan; each of the 16 households in the cooperative can increase production by 771 catties of grain. His typical report promoted all the representatives to find experience, find lessons, and find ways to increase production, which made everyone increase their confidence in running the cooperative. At the representative meeting in Ba County, Sun Shoushan and other cooperatives introduced the method of订计划and counting三笔账. Their method is: according to the soil quality and the national planting plan, determine the number of acres to be sown, and then discuss the conditions for increasing fertilizer, intensive cultivation, and water conservancy irrigation for various crops according to the conditions of the cooperative, and determine the production increase figures for various crops. In this way, the national plan and the conditions of the cooperative are linked together, and the members feel that the production increase plan can be realized. According to this approach, the representatives all plan to go back and mobilize the members to revise the plan. They said: "I didn't know the way before, but now I have found the way to increase production."
    In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, the labor use problem was studied at the representative meetings in various counties. In addition to properly dividing the farming team (or group), the labor day calculation problem was also discussed and resolved particularly carefully. Generally, the cooperatives have determined to change the past method of calculating work when helping each other, and promote the temporary contract work system or the seasonal contract work system; cooperatives with a foundation try out the year-round contract work system or the contract work and output system. For example, at the representative meeting in Raoyang County, after the representatives of Geng Changsuo and other cooperatives introduced their contract work experience, the representatives realized that contract work is in line with the principle of distribution according to work, and summarized five major benefits. (The five major benefits are: 1. After the contract work, whoever does more work gets more work points, which can promote the lazy to become diligent and the diligent to become more diligent; 2. After the contract work, the members can enhance their initiative and overcome the phenomenon of窝工; 3. It can reduce the trouble of the cadres in the cooperative assigning farm work and evaluating and recording work, so that they can carefully consider the various important issues in the cooperative; 4. After the contract work, semi-laborers can be more easily used reasonably; 5. After the contract work, under the principle of not affecting the production of the cooperative, their own odd jobs can be handled more flexibly.) The representatives all seriously learned the method of contract work.
    In terms of the leadership method of the cooperative, after each county introduced typical experiences, many problems were also solved. The representatives realized that the rural Party organizations should strengthen the leadership of the cooperative; the cooperative should rely on the Party organizations to run the cooperative well. In villages and townships with many cooperatives, mutual aid and cooperation committees and mutual aid and cooperation networks should be established. At the representative meetings in various counties, typical experiences in establishing mutual aid and cooperation committees and mutual aid and cooperation networks were introduced. The 128 cooperative representatives in Ba County jointly decided to establish 11 mutual aid and cooperation networks. The representatives said: "With this organization, it will be much easier to deal with difficulties." After introducing the typical experience, the representatives also realized the necessity of conducting political and ideological education for the members frequently, and learned some methods of conducting political and ideological education. At the representative meeting in Xingtai County, after discussion, everyone concentrated the experiences of the three cooperatives that did a better job in political work, and believed that there are three good methods that can be adopted: one is to cultivate various typical examples, establish banners, and adhere to long-term positive education; one is to conduct different education according to the different ideological characteristics of different people; one is to combine the actual situation and use comparison methods to conduct education. Representative Li Sanmei said: "Our cooperative was established in the spring of 1952, and the members have never been of one mind. At that time, I thought that if production increased in the fall, they would not talk nonsense and make trouble, but what happened? After production increased, two households still withdrew from the cooperative. This time, I have found the root cause of the problem, which is that we have not paid attention to political work."
    Tang County, Wangdu, Jianguo, Anguo, Raoyang and other counties had made material preparations to support agricultural production cooperatives before holding the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting. During the meeting, according to the requirements of the representatives, they organized supply and marketing cooperatives and production cooperatives to sign joint supply and sales contracts to solve the difficulties in living and production of various cooperatives. The Raoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and local grain and banking departments signed joint contracts with 21 cooperatives respectively, supplying grain, production materials, etc. to farmers worth more than 85 million yuan, and selling agricultural products worth more than 330 million yuan to these cooperatives. The Jianguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the bank抽38 cadres, led by the director and the president, to participate in the group discussions of the meeting, understand the specific requirements of each cooperative, and provide appropriate and necessary support after analysis. The county supply and marketing cooperative signed contracts with 177 cooperatives respectively, supplying a total value of 2.6 billion yuan, and also signed consignment sales contracts for sideline products. The County People's Bank granted loans of more than 1.05 billion yuan for farm tools and livestock at the meeting. Some cooperatives in Raoyang County were originally afraid of not having enough grain to plant peanuts and cotton, but after signing the contract, their morale was very high. They said: "If there is ice, there is no worry about not being able to化出 water." They revised the original plan and planned to plant more cotton and peanuts. The representatives of Jianguo County reflected that the difficulties of lacking production materials and living materials have been solved, and there are also ways to feed livestock and pigs. They must run the cooperative well when they go back.
    The shortcomings of the mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings held in various counties in Hebei Province are mainly that they neglected the leadership of the mutual aid groups, and the meeting did not specifically study and exchange experiences in带动mutual aid groups and办好mutual aid groups. In addition, some counties did not抓紧enough on the work of supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft production cooperatives, and failed to make the work of these economic departments better combined with agricultural production cooperatives. These are all things that should be improved in the future.

    把各个社的好经验集中起来普遍推广
    ——河北省各县春季召开互助合作代表会议的经验
    李凯
    河北省一百四十多个县的中共县委会，为进一步加强对互助合作运动的领导，动员各个农业生产合作社完成春耕生产任务，巩固农业生产合作社的组织，在二月下旬到三月下旬，先后召开了互助合作代表会议。在这些会议上，交流了经验，集中地解决了农业生产合作社的领导、经营管理和物资供应问题，并结合实际情况讨论了党在农村工作中的阶级路线。会议一般的都开得比较成功。
    从各地召开这次会议的经验来看，要开好互助合作代表会议，必须事先全面地了解互助合作运动的具体情况和问题，做到领导思想明确，心中有数。
    各县采用普遍了解、典型调查的方法，将全县的农业生产合作社分类排队，摸清了情况，抓住了问题。一般县份在会前都以主要干部为首，组织三个到四个工作组，到各区巡回检查，并根据日常掌握的材料，把各个社的情况作了具体分析。检查的结果是：一般的社大都可以巩固下去，并且可以办好，但也有许多问题必须解决。主要的是：（一）党在农村工作中的阶级路线贯彻得不够，许多社的骨干缺乏明确的阶级观点。有的认为富农会写账，生产条件好，吸收富农入社；有的认为贫农地薄无农具，入社是“捞一把”，对他们排斥歧视；也有的把中农的牲口、农具压低价格作价归社，侵犯了中农利益；还出现了不少只有中农参加的社和只有贫农参加的社。（二）有些社的经营方针不正确，重视副业轻视农业，依赖公家贷款摆大摊子。他们对农业上的巨大潜力认识不足，没有在农业上多方找寻增产门路。有的社没有制定生产计划；有的社虽订了计划但也是形式主义的，实际上能否增产，却心中无数，社员耽心不能增加收入，情绪不稳定。在劳力组织方面，有些社仍沿用互助组的一套，临时派工、临时评工、记工，造成比较严重的窝工现象。（三）新社大量发展后，新社干部工作热情很高，但缺乏办社的经验，遇到问题没法解决，情绪就低落了。（四）物资供应工作跟不上，三种合作社的结合工作没做好，有的社员缺粮食，缺生产资料，不能好好生产。
    在开互助合作代表会以前，还要做好培养典型的工作。中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出：“各级党委应该把定期召集各级的农业互助合作代表会议和农业技术会议以及各种座谈会等形式做为教育群众和干部的一种重要方法。代表会议的主要内容应是交流经验……进行思想政策的教育，动员完成任务，并从而促进农业互助组和农业生产合作社的发展。”交流经验既是召开代表会的主要内容，开代表会的时候，就不能光是领导讲群众听；而必须采用集中群众的经验教育群众的方法。为做到有领导有目的地交流经验，就必须做好培养典型的工作。河北省各县在会前都选择了十个到二十个的典型进行了培养工作。这些典型都是根据会议所要解决的问题来选择的。一种办法是根据日常了解的情况，派人到社进行培养；一种办法是在会议进行中，通过摆情况提问题，随时发现典型进行培养。对于这些典型，不能要求各方面都好，只要在某一个方面有可供大家学习的地方就行。几个典型加起来，就可以比较充分地交流各方面的经验了。
    在各县的互助合作代表会议上，领导方面做的报告都比较简要、明确，而把主要力量放在组织典型发言方面。先集中几个典型发言来解决一个问题；报告后，再组织到会代表联系本社实际情况进行讨论。用这种办法，一般地说，问题都解决得比较透。
    经过领导同志报告和典型人物发言，代表们进一步明确地了解了党在农村工作中的阶级路线。蠡县大杨庄的一个社的代表做典型发言时，谈到：他们社里对剥削分子警惕不够，吸收富农入了社；富农入社以后，多方挑拨社内的团结，剥削贫苦社员，差点把社弄垮。他们清楚地认识了：不清洗他们，社就不能巩固。这个生动的事实，提高了到会代表们的阶级警觉。大家经过讨论，确定要用回忆对比的方法启发社员的觉悟，清洗富农剥削分子以及其他反动分子，保持社的组织上的纯洁。关于依靠贫农与中农的巩固联盟的问题，在邢台县的代表会上，作了典型报告以后，代表们展开了热烈的讨论。北杨桐村崔志起说：“原先以为贫农是填不满的穷坑，我们规定入社的农具、牲口起码要值三百万元，不够就不要入社，这真是失掉立场的做法。回去一定找贫农谈，只要他们愿入社，就把他们吸收进来。”也有的代表检讨了他们社里侵犯中农利益的偏向，回去后要解决入社牲口、农具代价不合理的问题。一个村里有中农、贫农分别组织合作社的，可暂不变动，但要规定合理代价，互相调剂农具、劳力，加强联系，以巩固贫农和中农的团结。
    在经营管理方面，各县经过大会典型发言和小组讨论，更明确地认识了搞好农业生产，提高产量，增加社员收入，是巩固社和提高社的重要关键。在邢台县的互助合作代表会议上，由代表王万藻介绍了他们社的经验教训。他们这个社去年认为“农业没大发展头”，大量地经营商业、副业，社里共六十二个劳力，抽出四十三个劳力经营开店、跑行商等商业和油坊、花坊等副业，油坊的麻饼不往地里施，锄苗时把劳力抽出来贩卖木炭；结果，庄稼减产，社员思想混乱，二十三户要退社。经过学习总路线，明确了前进的方向，确定以农业为主。已经修整了五十亩地，估计可增产花生一万多斤；他们还计划在五年内修地二百亩、修梯田一百亩，旱田变水田三十亩。对这种经营方针，社员都很拥护，社也就巩固了。
    在霸县的互助合作代表会议上，代表李耀彬介绍了他们社依赖国家贷款，盲目投资，增加了生产却不能增加收入的教训。代表王成续听了这个发言以后说：“原来我社打算贷一千万元的款摆个大摊子；这回可教育了我。若不，秋后不知道会弄成什么样子。”很多社的代表都纠正了盲目投资的思想。树立了精打细算的思想。五区二十四个社原计划贷款一亿零三百万元，缩小到五千六百九十万元。
    在明确经营方针、和资本主义划清界限的基础上，各县领导方面都进一步引导代表们找农业上的增产门路。满城县陈瑞社的代表谈，他们社根据本身的条件，找出打井扩大水田、改良土壤、提高技术等九种增产方法，比原计划可多增产一万二千多斤粮食；全社十六户，每户可增产七百七十一斤粮食。他的典型报告，推动了所有代表找经验、找教训、找增产门路，使大家提高了办社的信心。霸县的代表会议上，由孙寿山等社介绍了订计划和算三笔账的办法。他们的办法是：根据土质和国家种植计划，确定出播种亩数，再根据社的条件，讨论出各种作物增肥、精耕细作、水利灌溉等条件，确定各种作物增产数字。这样，就把国家计划和本社条件联系起来了，社员们也感到增产计划有把握实现。代表们根据这种做法，都打算回去发动社员修订计划，他们说：“以前不摸门，现在摸到增产门路了。”
    为了保证实现增产计划，各个县的代表会上都研究了劳力使用的问题。除了要把耕作队（或组）划分妥当以外，还特别仔细地讨论和解决了劳动日的计算问题。一般的社都确定要改变过去互助时的计工方法，推行临时包工制或季节包工制；有基础的社，试行常年包工或包工包产制。如饶阳县的代表会议上，由耿长锁等社的代表介绍了包工经验后，代表们认识到包工符合按劳取酬的原则，总结出五大好处。（五大好处是：一、包工后谁做的活多，谁多得工数，可促使懒的变勤、勤的更勤；二、包工后社员可增强主动性，克服窝工现象；三、可减少社内干部分配农活和评分记工的麻烦，使他们能够精心考虑社里的各种重要问题；四、包工后半劳力可以更便于合理使用；五、包工以后，在不影响社的生产的原则下，可以比较灵活地处理自己的零活。）代表们都认真地学习了包工的办法。
    在社的领导方法方面，各县介绍了典型经验以后，也解决了不少问题。代表们认识到了：农村党的组织要加强对社的领导；社要依靠党的组织把社办好。社多的村和乡，要建立互助合作委员会和互助合作网。各县的代表会上，都介绍了建立互助合作委员会和互助合作网的典型经验。霸县一百二十八个社的代表，共同商定建立十一个互助合作网。代表们说：“有了这个组织，遇到困难就好办多了。”介绍了典型经验以后，代表们也认识到了经常向社员进行政治思想教育的必要，学会了一些进行政治思想教育的方法。在邢台县的代表会上，经过讨论，大家把政治工作做得较好的三个社的经验集中起来，认为有三种好方法可以采用：一种是培养各种典型，树立旗帜，坚持长期的正面教育；一种是根据不同人的思想特点，进行不同的教育；一种是结合实际用对比方法进行教育。代表李三美说：“我们的社从一九五二年春建立起来，社员总不一个心眼。那时我想，秋后增了产，他们就不乱说乱闹了，结果呢？增了产还是有两户退了社。这回可找到病根了，病根就在我们没有注意政治工作。”
    唐县、望都、建国、安国、饶阳等县，在开互助合作代表会议以前就做好了支持农业生产合作社进行生产的物质准备工作。在会议进行中，又根据代表们的要求，组织供销社和生产合作社，订立了供应和推销的结合合同，解决了各个社生活、生产上的困难。饶阳县供销合作社及当地粮食、银行部门，和二十一个社分别订立了结合合同，供应给农民的粮食、生产资料等总值达八千五百多万元，给这些社推销的农产品总值达三亿三千多万元。建国县供销合作社和银行，抽出三十八个干部，由主任和行长带领，参加会议的小组讨论，了解各个社的具体要求，经过分析给以恰当的必要的支持。县供销社和一百七十七个社分别订立了合同，供应总值达二十六亿元，还订立了副业产品代销合同。县人民银行在会上贷出农具、牲畜等贷款十亿五千多万元。饶阳县有的社原来怕多种花生、棉花以后没粮吃，订了合同以后情绪很高。他们说：“有冰就不愁化不出水来。”修改了原来的计划，打算多种棉花、花生。建国县的代表们反映：这一下，缺生产资料、生活资料的困难解决了，喂牲口、喂猪也有了办法，回去一定要把社办好。
    河北省各县召开的互助合作代表会议的缺点，主要是忽视了对互助组的领导，会上没有具体地研究和交流带动互助组、办好互助组的经验。另外，有些县份对于供销合作社、信用合作社、手工业生产合作社的工作，抓得不够紧，没有能使这些经济部门的工作，更好地与农业生产合作社结合起来。这些都是应当在以后注意改进的。
