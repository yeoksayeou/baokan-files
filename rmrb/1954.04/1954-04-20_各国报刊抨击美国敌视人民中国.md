Foreign Newspapers Criticize U.S. Hostility Towards People's China
    U.S. "Embargo" Policy Suffers Defeat

    "Pravda" correspondent in Beijing, M. Domogatskikh, published an article entitled "The U.S. Policy of Economic Discrimination Against China."

    Domogatskikh wrote: Ignoring reality, the U.S. ruling circles are still clinging to the bankrupt "policy of strength." One aspect of this policy is the desperate attempt to impose economic discrimination against People's China. It is for this purpose that the U.S. hastily forced the UN General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution imposing an economic blockade against China.

    The policy of economic discrimination against China has aroused strong opposition from countries that have suffered serious difficulties due to the arbitrary policies of the United States. This policy has had a particularly disastrous impact on the economies of countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia, which have historically had close economic and cultural ties with the great Chinese people. The arbitrary policies adopted by the U.S. in international trade have had an adverse impact on the economies of countries that have succumbed to this policy.

    Domogatskikh cited Malaya, Indonesia, and Japan as examples to illustrate that business people in these countries believe that normal trade relations with China must be established. For example, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Aiichiro Fujiyama, said in a recent speech that developing trade relations with China is beneficial to Japan. He also said that this relationship is developing. In 1953, the total volume of imports and exports in Sino-Japanese trade increased compared to 1952. The reporter pointed out: This shows that the U.S. "embargo" policy has not been supported by most Japanese companies.

    The article said: The trade relations between the People's Republic of China and other countries are based on mutual benefit and do not have any unacceptable conditions attached. It is for this reason that these trade relations have been supported by the business communities of countries that trade with China. As a result, regardless of U.S. obstruction, China is still doing business with countries such as India, Pakistan, Burma, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Finland, Egypt, and Chile.

    Domogatskikh concluded: The U.S. "policy of strength" – of which economic discrimination against democratic countries is one manifestation – runs counter to the national interests of all countries and will inevitably suffer repeated defeats. The mastermind behind the economic blockade against China has failed to isolate China, and has in fact severely damaged the economic interests of those capitalist countries that are prohibited by the U.S. from trading with China.

  The Enemies of People's China are the Enemies of Peace

    A recent issue of "New Times" magazine published an article entitled "The Enemies of People's China are the Enemies of Peace."

    Author Ilyushkin pointed out that the U.S. aggressive policy is the main obstacle on the road to consolidating lasting peace in Asia. He wrote: Establishing new military springboards south of the border of the People's Republic of China, and then provoking People's China with military actions, this is the current "action plan" of the aggressors. It is worth noting that the U.S. aggressive bloc is putting forward this new plan precisely now, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, which is preparing to resolve the issues of Indochina and Korea by peaceful means.

    The author emphasized: Attempting to undermine the Geneva Conference in advance, and stifling the confidence of people of all countries in the possibility of easing international tensions and guaranteeing lasting peace, this is the vile aim of the new conspiracy of the enemies of peace.

    The author continued: The U.S. policy aimed at aggression against China has aroused widespread dissatisfaction in India and other Asian countries committed to defending the right to pursue a policy of national independence. The U.S. instigated the convening of an "anti-communist" conference in Seoul in an attempt to assemble a military bloc of aggressive Asian countries, but this attempt has in fact gone bankrupt. On the eve of the Geneva Conference, widespread public opinion and even officials in some Western countries in Asia are increasingly firmly advocating the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. World public opinion widely hopes that the Geneva Conference can end this intolerable situation—that the great People's Republic of China is denied participation in international organizations, while its place is illegally occupied by Kuomintang elements.

    The author further pointed out: The growing dissatisfaction with the U.S. policy of ignoring People's China has caused unease among the U.S. ruling circles. In early March, U.S. Congressman McCormack expressed his concern in the House of Representatives that the United States' increasing isolation on the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations made him feel "alarmed." However, despite the obvious bankruptcy of the policy of ignoring People's China, the reactionary warmongers in the United States are still clinging to this policy, attempting to obstruct the easing of international tensions with various new tricks. These enemies of peace have threatened to "resolutely oppose" the demand for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations in Geneva.

    The author concluded: The People's Republic of China's policy is to transform Asia from a source of war into a reliable fortress of international peace, and therefore this policy is universally supported. The people demand an end to the despicable policy of ignoring the legitimate rights of People's China. To safeguard and consolidate world peace, it is necessary to abandon this policy.

  Provocations Against China Are Bound to Fail

    The Czechoslovak "Red Right" newspaper published a commentary on April 15, condemning the U.S. policy of aggression against China. The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' intensification of provocations and threats of aggression against the People's Republic of China on the eve of the Geneva Conference is a direct violation of the wishes of the people of all countries.

    The commentary said that peace-loving people of all countries are increasingly aware that only with cooperation with the great China can peace in the Far East be guaranteed. Hundreds of millions of people around the world hope that the Geneva Conference will be successful.

    The commentary concluded: "In the face of hundreds of millions of people, the U.S. war policy against the People's China and against peace in Korea and Indochina is suffering one failure after another. The people of all countries believe that if U.S. aggressors attempt to create a repeat of the intervention in Korea, then the greatest failure awaits them."

  It is the United States, Not China, That is Engaging in Aggression

    The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial on April 16 entitled "A Challenge to Asia," vehemently criticizing the U.S. attempt to expand the Indochina War and oppose the People's Republic of China through "joint action."

    The editorial said that this U.S. approach will not be supported by the people of Asia. The U.S. is unwilling to accept the economic consequences of peace, and it has no sincerity towards the Geneva Conference. The editorial pointed out that the U.S. hopes to coerce other countries to participate in the Indochina War, as it did in Korea.

    The editorial refuted the U.S. slanders that China is "interfering" in the Indochina War, saying: "For the vast majority of millions of Asians who are not communists, if there are any aggressors besides the French in Indochina, then this aggressor seems to be the United States, not China. The U.S. policy towards Indochina is an improved and strengthened version of the U.S. policy in Korea. There, the U.S. acted as if it was controlling the United Nations, and in the United Nations, the majority vote was often not obtained in an honorable manner. The facts that China is said to be an aggressor, the United Nations' resolution on joint action, and the absolute acquiescence to Syngman Rhee's warmongering all show that it is the United States, not China, that is engaging in aggression."

    The editorial said that China—one of the legitimate great powers in the United Nations—has been blocked by the United States from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations organization. It has been deprived of its legitimate status because the U.S. wants to act recklessly in the world.

    The editorial said: "Dulles hopes that some of Asia's economically dependent or politically subservient countries will fight against China. But many people believe that the Chinese people are peace-loving, determined, and well-organized, and their strength has increased the strength of the people of other Asian countries."

### 各国报刊抨击美国敌视人民中国

    各国报刊抨击美国敌视人民中国
    美国“禁运”政策遭到失败
    “真理报”驻北京记者麦·多莫加茨基赫发表了一篇题为“美国对中国的经济歧视政策”的文章。
    多莫加茨基赫写道：美国统治集团不顾现实，现在还在死死抱住早就破了产的“实力政策”。这种政策的一个方面，是拼命设法对人民中国实行经济歧视。正是为了这个目的，美国才迫使联合国大会匆匆通过了一项对中国实行经济封锁的非法决议。
    在经济方面对中国采取的歧视政策，引起了由于美国的专横政策而遭到了严重困难的国家的强烈反对。这种政策对远东和东南亚国家的经济产生了特别具有灾难性的影响，这些国家在历史上是与伟大的中国人民有着密切的经济和文化关系的。美国在国际贸易方面所采取的专横政策，对那些屈从这种政策的国家的经济产生了不利的影响。
    多莫加茨基赫举出马来亚、印度尼西亚和日本为例来说明这些国家的商界人士都认为必须与中国建立正常的贸易关系。例如，日本通商产业相爱知在最近发表的演说中就说，与中国发展贸易关系对日本是有利的。他又说，这种关系正在发展着。在一九五三年，中日贸易的进出口总额比一九五二年增多。记者指出：这就说明，美国的“禁运”政策并没有得到大部分日本企业公司的支持。
    文章说：中华人民共和国与其他国家之间的贸易关系，是以互利为基础的，并不附有任何不能接受的条件。正是为了这个缘故，这种贸易关系得到了与中国贸易的国家的商界的拥护。结果，不管美国如何阻挠，中国还是在与印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、瑞典、英国、芬兰、埃及和智利等国做生意。
    多莫加茨基赫最后说：美国的“实力政策”——对民主阵营国家的经济歧视是它的表现之一——是与所有国家的民族利益背道而驰的，并且不可避免地会遭到不断的失败。对中国实行经济封锁的主使人并未能把中国孤立起来，实际上倒是严重地损害了那些被美国禁止与中国贸易的资本主义国家的经济利益。
  人民中国的敌人是和平的敌人
    最近一期的“新时代”杂志发表了一篇文章，题目是“人民中国的敌人就是和平的敌人”。
    作者伊留歇金指出：美国的侵略政策是建立亚洲巩固与持久和平的道路上的主要障碍。他写道：在中华人民共和国国界以南建立新的军事跳板，然后以军事行动对人民中国挑衅，这就是侵略者当前的“行动计划”。值得注意的是：美国侵略集团恰恰在现在、在准备以和平方法解决印度支那问题和朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议召开的前夕，提出这种新的计划。
    作者强调说：力图事先破坏日内瓦会议，扼杀各国人民对于有可能缓和国际紧张局势并保障持久和平的信心，这就是和平的敌人新的阴谋的卑鄙目的。
    作者接着说：美国旨在侵略中国的政策，引起印度以及其他致力于维护执行民族独立政策的权利的亚洲国家普遍的不满。美国曾策动在汉城召开
  “反共”会议，以拼凑侵略性的亚洲各国的军事集团，然而这种企图实际上已经破产了。在日内瓦会议前夕，广泛的舆论以及亚洲甚至一些西方国家的官方人士，越来越坚决地主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。世界广泛的舆论希望，日内瓦会议能结束这种不能容忍的状况——伟大的中华人民共和国被拒绝参加国际组织，而它的位置却被国民党分子非法占据。
    作者接着指出：对于美国无视人民中国的政策的越来越大的不满，引起美国统治集团的不安。三月初，美国议员麦考马克就曾在众议院担心地说，美国在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中合法权利的问题上的日益孤立，使他感到“惊慌”。然而，尽管无视人民中国的政策已经显然破产，美国反动的好战分子仍然死抱住这一政策，企图用种种新的诡计阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。这些和平的敌人扬言将在日内瓦“坚决反对”恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利的要求。
    作者最后写道：中华人民共和国的政策是要把亚洲由战争的策源地变为国际和平的可靠的堡垒，因此，这个政策得到普遍的拥护。人民要求终止执行忽视人民中国合法权利的卑鄙政策。要保障并巩固世界和平，就必需放弃这一政策。
  对中国进行挑衅必然失败
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”四月十五日发表评论，谴责美国对中国的侵略政策。评论指出，美帝国主义者在日内瓦会议开会前夕加紧对中华人民共和国进行挑衅和侵略威胁，是直接违反各国人民的愿望的。
    评论说，爱好和平的各国人民日益清楚地认识到，只有与伟大的中国合作，远东的和平才有保障。全世界数以亿计的人民希望日内瓦会议获得成功。
    评论最后说：“在数以亿计的人民面前，美国的反对人民中国、反对朝鲜和印度支那和平的战争政策遭到一个接连一个的失败。各国人民相信，美国侵略者如果企图制造一个干涉朝鲜政策的翻版，那末，最大的失败在等着他们。”
  进行侵略的是美国而不是中国
    印度“国民先驱报”四月十六日以“对亚洲的挑战”为题发表社论，猛烈抨击美国企图通过“联合行动”，扩大印度支那战争和反对中华人民共和国。
    社论说，美国这种做法不会得到亚洲人民的拥护。美国不愿意接受和平的经济后果，它对日内瓦会议没有诚意。社论指出，美国希望像在朝鲜那样，胁迫其它国家参加印度支那战争。
    社论驳斥美国污蔑中国“干涉”印度支那战争的谰言说：“对于大多数不是共产党的千百万亚洲人来说，如果除了在印度支那的法国以外还有侵略者的话，那么这个侵略者似乎就是美国，而不是中国。美国对印度支那的政策就是改进了的、而且更加强了的美国在朝鲜的政策。在那里，美国的所作所为好像它是在控制着联合国，而在联合国内，多数票经常不是以光荣的方法取得的。把中国说成是侵略者、联合国的联合行动的决议、以及绝对默许李承晚的好战行为等事实，都表明了进行侵略的正是美国而不是中国。”
    社论说，中国——联合国中合法的大国之一——受到了美国的阻挠，不能取得它在联合国组织中的合法席位。它之所以被剥夺其合法地位，是因为美国想肆无忌惮地在世界上横行。
    社论说：“杜勒斯希望（美国在）亚洲的一些经济上的附属国或政治上的仆从国去和中国作战。但有许多人认为，中国人民酷爱和平、有决心和有良好的组织，他们的力量使得其他亚洲国家的人民增加了力量。”　（新华社）
