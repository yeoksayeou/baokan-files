    Songjiang Province Labor Bureau, Health Department and Other Departments Organize Joint Work Group to Inspect Safety and Health Preparations for Key Projects
    The Songjiang Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau, Health Department, Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and other relevant departments organized a joint work group and went to key projects in Jiamusi City, Hegang Coal Mine, and other places to inspect the safety and health preparations before construction.
    Judging from the inspection, all basic construction units have fully launched safety and health preparations before construction. Jiamusi City held four meetings in March to inspect the safety and health preparations of various basic construction units before construction. Jiamusi City Engineering Company, which contracted the Jiamusi Sugar Factory project, formulated a safety and health measures plan while formulating the construction organization, design, and construction operation plan. It also organized security guards and material handlers to carefully inspect scaffolding poles and planks. During the inspection, it was found that 40% of the scaffolding poles did not meet the specifications, and they are now actively making up for it. More than 70% of various labor protection supplies during construction, such as safety belts, work clothes, and shoulder pads, have been prepared. Party A of Jiamusi Sugar Factory has actively started inspecting foreign orders. The Northeast Textile Bureau Engineering Company has sent people to construction sites in Mudanjiang, Acheng, Hulan, and Jiamusi to inspect safety and health preparations. All kinds of protective equipment needed for construction this year have been included in the construction plan. The Mudanjiang City Engineering Company learned from the lessons of two major accidents caused by insufficient safety equipment last year. Before construction, it established a security section and established technical security groups in each engineering team; it also transferred nineteen experienced old workers to serve as full-time security guards. Recently, the company has transferred forty-four security guards, material handlers, and scaffolding workers to go deep into various construction sites to inspect scaffolding poles, planks, and various tools to ensure safe commencement of construction this year.

    松江省劳动局卫生厅等部门组织联合工作组
    检查重点工程的安全卫生准备工作
    松江省人民政府劳动局、卫生厅、省工会等有关部门组织联合工作组，分赴佳木斯市、鹤岗煤矿等重点工程，检查施工前的安全卫生准备工作。
    从检查情况看来，目前各基本建设单位已经全面展开了施工前的安全卫生准备工作。佳木斯市在三月份先后召开了四次会议，检查了各基本建设施工单位施工前的安全卫生准备工作。承包佳木斯糖厂工程的佳木斯市工程公司，在制订施工组织、设计和施工作业计划同时，就制订了安全卫生措施计划。并组织了保安员、材料员，认真检查了脚手杆、脚手板。在检查中，发现有百分之四十的脚手杆不合规格，现正积极补救。施工中的各种劳动防护用品：如安全带、工作服和垫肩等已准备好百分之七十以上。佳木斯糖厂甲方已积极着手检查国外订货。东北纺织局工程公司已派人分赴牡丹江、阿城、呼兰和佳木斯等工地检查安全卫生准备工作。并将今年施工所需要的各种防护用具，全部订入施工计划之内。牡丹江市工程公司接受去年因安全设备不够而造成的两次重大事故的教训，在施工前建立了保安科，在各工程队建立了技术保安小组；并抽调了十九名有经验的老工人担任专职保安员。最近公司又抽调了四十四名保安员、材料员、绑架子工，深入各工地检查脚手杆、脚手板及各项工具，以保证今年安全开工。　（蓝　天）
