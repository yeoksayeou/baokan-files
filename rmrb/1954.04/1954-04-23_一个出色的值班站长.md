    An Outstanding Station Master on Duty
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    April 9, 1954, marked the 803rd day without accidents at Tangguantun Station. The station master on duty, Dong Jiabin, stood on the platform, a train having just passed. He silently watched the platform, the tracks, and the signals. He felt a special excitement, like a soldier who had won a battle.

    Tangguantun Station is a small station, without electric lights, only a long, low building housing the passenger waiting room, the station master's office, and the office. At night, the station is pitch black, and if it weren't for the flickering oil lamp in the hand of the station master on duty, you wouldn't even realize it was a station.

    "Don't think that just because this is a small station, whether or not there are accidents doesn't matter!" Dong Jiabin often said earnestly to all the station's staff:
    "But it is also a section of the Jinpu Railway! More than fifty trains pass through here every day. Passengers traveling from Beijing to Shanghai, and mechanical equipment being transported from Shanghai to the Northeast, all pass through here. If even one train has a problem here, the entire Jinpu Railway's trains cannot run smoothly. The year before last, I saw a train have an accident at a small station—Lianzheng Station. The carriages derailed, and the ore inside spilled all over the ground. Many trains had to stop and wait until that train resumed running before they could proceed."

    But preventing accidents is indeed not easy. If you stand at Tangguantun Station for ten minutes, you will see trains entering and leaving the station one after another. These trains coming and going all require Dong Jiabin's hard work. He has to direct the switchmen to accurately operate the switches, allowing the trains to enter the designated tracks; he has to notify the cargo handlers and station attendants to promptly receive and dispatch goods and passengers; he has to listen for notifications from the dispatching office and neighboring stations—what time, what kind of train will enter the station; he also has to tell neighboring stations what time, what kind of train will be coming; he also has to check the tracks, switches, platforms, water towers, signals, and train order exchange devices, etc., to see if there are any problems. When he does so much work, he cannot say a wrong word or a wrong number, he cannot issue a wrong order, he cannot neglect even a small matter. Otherwise, accidents will invade like enemies.

    Dong Jiabin will always remember this day—January 28, 1952. On this day, the station master on duty, Wen Heyi, dispatched a train and sat comfortably by the stove in the office, preparing to rest for a while. He said to Dong Jiabin with a smile, "Old Dong, we've successfully completed our task today, there's nothing more to do..." As he spoke, he stretched. Suddenly, the telephone rang, and a voice came from the phone: "Hello, Tangguantun Station! Why did you send the train without completing the train dispatching and return procedures?" Wen Heyi hadn't personally checked and had forgotten to complete the dispatching procedures. This was considered a serious accident. Because without completing the train dispatching and return procedures, the dispatched train could collide with a train on the way, causing a train derailment.

    "Since January 28, 1952," Dong Jiabin told me, "we haven't had another accident until today."
    "How did you manage to avoid accidents?"

    He didn't answer me directly. Later, I learned about the facts of how he prevented accidents from others.

    Everyone at Tangguantun Station knows that Old Dong is a serious person when it comes to work. When he gives train operation instructions to the switchmen, he often says, "Did you hear clearly? Repeat it again!" The switchman would say, "Yes, I heard clearly." Dong Jiabin didn't think "my responsibility is over" after hearing this reply; he would still go to the tracks to check. There was one time when a train was about to arrive, and he notified the switchman, "Attention, switch to the first track!" After a while, the switchman reported to him: "Station Master Dong, I have already switched the track." "Is it the first track?" "Yes," the switchman replied with confidence. Dong Jiabin put down the telephone and walked out of the office, opened the entrance signal, and carefully looked at the tracks. Based on his experience, he felt that the track switched this time didn't seem quite right. To prevent any possibility, he signaled to the switch house in the distance, indicating again the meaning of "switch to the first track." The switchman saw the signal and quickly returned the same signal, indicating that it was the first track. Dong Jiabin was still not reassured and signaled again. When the switchman saw Station Master Dong signaling again, he felt that there must be a problem, so he looked at the switch and realized that he had mistakenly switched the switch to the second track. The switchman urgently corrected the mistake, saying, "If Station Master Dong hadn't checked carefully, the train would have entered the second track, and it would have overturned the vehicles on the second track."

    Late at night, Dong Jiabin sat alone in the station house, under the oil lamp, constantly recording the changes in train operation at every moment on paper. After the train departed, the station immediately became quiet. Dong Jiabin still watched the telephone. He thought about the great responsibility of the station master on duty and the honor of the station not having an accident for more than eight hundred days. Sometimes, he wanted to close his eyes for a moment, but he immediately stood up and walked around the station house, or ran to the washbasin to wash his face. In his memory, there has never been the shameful act of "sleeping on duty." Jinghai Station used to have frequent accidents because someone slept during the night shift. The station master on duty at that station was transferred away, and the superiors wanted Dong Jiabin to replace his work. After Dong Jiabin went there, Jinghai Station truly changed, no one slept on the night shift, and no accidents occurred.

    When Dong Jiabin was on duty, he liked to check the station equipment that he was already very familiar with, as if he didn't trust his own eyesight, and he always wanted to operate them himself. He would test the signals several times a day, wanting to find some problems in the signals. Some station masters on duty didn't test them much, thinking, "Anyway, it's mechanized, even if you don't test it, it will still show the signal." Dong Jiabin didn't think that way, he said, "Although it can automatically show the signal, it is still made of iron after all. Iron will contract in winter and expand in summer. When it rains, it will rust. If you don't test it, you won't discover its changes, and you will suffer. If it has changed, and you want to switch to the green light, but it happens to show a light that is neither red nor green. At this time, the driver comes with the train, and when he sees this unclear light, he has to stop. This will cause an unwarranted stop accident. Many stations have suffered this loss." Dong Jiabin didn't allow any loopholes in his own work, nor did he allow others to have loopholes. He often said that if others have accidents, the country also suffers losses. The station master on duty at Machang Station once notified Tangguantun Station to prepare to receive the train. Dong Jiabin received this notification, thought about it, and suddenly remembered that Machang Station had not yet completed the train operation procedures. He was extremely anxious, as if he had made a mistake himself, and quickly picked up the telephone and called Machang Station: "Attention! Machang Station! You haven't completed the procedures, how can you ask us to receive the train? That won't do!..." When the station attendant at Machang Station received this call, he was so frightened that he shouted: "Wait a minute, I'll go ask the station master to see if he has completed the procedures." Not long after, Machang Station called again, apologizing and saying: "Thank you, Station Master Dong, for helping us avoid an accident. We are now completing the procedures for you." Dong Jiabin regarded the station as his own home, the place where he worked, studied, and lived. When he was off duty, he was unwilling to leave the station. Although he could receive twelve privately used free train tickets a year, he had only used one in more than a year. He was afraid that the station's work would go wrong. Once, during his off-duty time, he walked around the station and found that the station's switch was switched incorrectly, he immediately shouted: "The switch is wrong!" People in the station heard it and immediately corrected the switch. During his days off, he had prevented others' accidents four times.

    Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, he has never been late by a minute. In his view, directing train operation work requires the same accuracy as a clock. His every move at work is meticulous, serious, and accurate. For more than two years, his notifications and his orders have not been wrong. His serious attitude towards work has become a habit. He once summarized his work experience in preventing accidents into the famous "Eight-Item Work System for Train Operation" in Tianjin Railway. Many small station masters on duty use this system to direct train operation work, and they have also reduced train operation accidents. Due to his exemplary deeds, he has been named a model worker in Tianjin.

    一个出色的值班站长
    本报记者　陈迹
    一九五四年四月九日，是唐官屯车站不出事故的第八百零三天。值班站长董家彬站在站台上，一列火车已经过去了，他还默默地看着站台、线路和信号机。好像一个战士打了胜仗一样，他怀着一种特别激动的心情。
    唐官屯车站是个小车站，没有电灯，只有一幢长方形的矮房子，里面却安排着旅客候车室、站长室和办公室。在夜晚，车站是漆黑的，要不是值班站长手里摇幌着的油灯闪闪发光，你真不会发现这是车站哩。
    “你不要以为这是个小车站，出不出事故，算不得什么！”董家彬常常向全站职工很认真地说：
  “但是，它也是津浦铁路的一节肠子呀！每天从这里要走过五十多趟列车。从北京到上海去的旅客，从上海运往东北去的机械设备，都要经过这里。只要一趟列车在这儿出了毛病，整个津浦铁路的列车就不能顺顺当当地走动了。我在前年看见一趟列车在一个小车站——连镇车站出了事故，车厢脱离了轨道，车里的矿石哗哗地翻在地上。许多列车都只好停车，等到这趟车恢复运行以后，才能前进。”
    但要不出事故，的确也不容易。你站在唐官屯车站上，等上十多分钟，就会看见火车一会儿进站了，一会儿又出站了。这些进进出出的列车，都要董家彬付出辛苦的劳动。他要指挥扳道员，准确地扳动道岔，让列车进入指定的线路；他要通知货物员、站务员，及时地接送货物和旅客；他要听候调度所和邻近车站的通知——什么时刻，什么样的列车要进入车站；他也要告诉邻近车站，什么时刻，什么样的列车就要来了；他还要看看线路、道岔、站台、给水机、信号机和车牌授受机等各种车站设备，是不是有毛病。他做这样许多工作的时候，不能说错一句话、一个数字，不能发错一个命令，不能疏忽一件小事。否则，事故就会像敌人一样侵袭进来。
    董家彬永远记得这一天——一九五二年一月二十八日。在这一天里，值班站长温合义送出了一列车，舒舒服服地坐在办公室的火炉旁边，准备休息一下。他笑嘻嘻地跟董家彬说：“老董，今天胜利完成任务，没有什么事了。……”说着，他舒展了一下身子。忽然，电话铃响了，电话里传出了声音：“喂，唐官屯车站！你们为什么不办理行车的折返手续，就把列车开来了？”温合义没有亲自检查，忘记了办理行车的手续。这算是一个严重的事故。因为不办理行车的折返手续，开出的列车可能撞上中途的列车，发生列车颠覆事故。
      “自从一九五二年一月二十八日这一天起，”董家彬向我说道：“一直到今天，我们再没有出过事故。”
      “你们怎样做到不出事故的呢？”
    他没有直接答复我，后来，我从别人的口里，知道了他怎样防止事故的事实。
    唐官屯车站的人没有一个不知道：老董这个人，办事认真。他给扳道员传达行车指示的时候，常说：“听清楚了吗？你再回说一遍！”扳道员说：“是了，听清楚了。”董家彬听了这个答复，并不以为“我的责任完了”，他还到线路上去看。有
  一次，列车快开来了，他通知扳道员：“注意，扳第一股道！”过了一会，扳道员向他报告：“董站长，我已经扳好道了。”“是第一股道吗？”“是的。”扳道员很有把握地答道。董家彬放下电话机，走出办公室，拉开了进站的信号灯，又仔细地瞧瞧线路。凭他的经验，他觉得这一次扳的股道有些不大对头。为了防止万一，他向远远的扳道房打了手势，再度表示要“扳第一股道”的意思。扳道员看了手势，迅速回了同样的手势，说明扳的是第一股道。董家彬还不放心，又打了手势。扳道员看见董站长又打手势，感到这里面一定有问题，于是看了看道岔，才发现自己错误地把道岔扳到第二股道去了。扳道员紧急地改正了错误，连说：“要不是董站长仔细检查，列车开进了第二股道，准会撞翻第二股道上的车辆。”
    深夜里，董家彬一个人坐在站房里，在油灯下，不停地在纸上记载着每时每刻发生的行车变化的情况。列车开出去了，车站立刻肃静了。董家彬还守望着电话机。他想着值班站长的重大的责任，想着车站八百多天不出事故的荣誉。有时候，他也想要闭一下眼睛；但他立刻站起来，在站房里走动一下，或者跑到洗脸盆前面洗洗头。在他的记忆里，还从来没有过“值班时睡觉”的丑事。静海车站过去因为有人值夜班时睡觉，常常出事故。这个车站的值班站长被调走了，上级要董家彬去代替他的工作。董家彬去了之后，静海车站果真变了，没有人在上夜班时睡觉，也没有发生事故。
    董家彬上了班，喜欢检查他已经非常熟悉的车站设备，他好像不相信自己眼力似地总要亲自动动它们。他一天要试验好几遍信号机，想要从信号机里找出些毛病来。有些值班站长不大试验它，觉得：“反正它是机械化的，不试验，它也会显出信号。”董家彬可不这样想，他说：“虽然它能够自动地显出信号，但它毕竟是铁做的。铁这个东西，在冬天它会收缩，在夏天它会伸胀。下了雨，它又会生锈。你不试验它，发现不了它的变化，你就会吃亏。如果，它有了变化，你想要扳绿灯，它却偏偏显出个不红不绿的灯光。这时候，司机开来列车，看见这个不清楚的灯光，就不能不停车。这样就造成无故的停车事故。许多车站就吃过这个苦头。”董家彬不容许自己工作出一点漏洞，也不容许别人出漏洞。他常说，别人出事故，也是国家受损失。马厂车站值班站长曾经通知唐官屯车站准备接车。董家彬得到这个通知，想了想，忽然记起马厂车站还没有办理行车的手续，他急坏了，好像自己做错了工作似地，赶紧拿起电话，叫唤马厂车站：“注意！马厂车站！你们还没有办理手续，怎么就叫我们接车呢？这不行呀！……”马厂车站站务员接到这个电话，吓得直叫：“等一等，我去问站长，看办了手续没有。”没多久，马厂车站又来电话，抱歉地说：“谢谢你们董站长，帮助我们避免了事故。现在我们向你们办理手续。”董家彬把车站看成是自己的家，自己工作、学习和生活的地方。他歇班的时候，不愿意离开车站。他一年虽然可以领取十二张私用免费的火车票，但他一年多只用过一张。他生怕车站的工作出差错。有一次在他歇班的时间，他在车站的周围走来走去，发现车站的道岔扳错了，他立刻叫喊：“道岔错了！”车站里的人听见了，马上改正了道岔。他在歇班的日子里，曾经防止了别人的四次事故。
    一年三百六十五天，他没有迟到过一分钟。在他看来，指挥行车工作，要求要像钟表一样的准确。他在工作中一举一动都是细致、认真和准确的。两年多来，他的通知，他的命令，没有一个是错误的。他认真工作的态度，已经成了习惯。他曾经把他防止事故的工作经验，总结成为天津铁路有名的“行车八项工作制度”。许多小车站值班站长按照这个制度，指挥行车工作，也都减少了行车事故。由于他的模范事迹，他已被评为天津市的劳动模范。
