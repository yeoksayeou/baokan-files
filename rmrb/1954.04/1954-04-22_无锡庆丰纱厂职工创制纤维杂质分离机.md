Workers at the private Qingfeng Yarn Factory in Wuxi City, including technicians Li Jiamou, Cai Zengming, and workers Dai Abing and Fan Jingen, demonstrated the spirit of technical innovation and successfully created a fiber impurity separator. This provides an effective solution for cotton textile factories to utilize chopped cotton waste on a large scale and reduce the consumption of raw cotton.

This machine has a very high impurity removal efficiency. It can reduce the impurity content of cotton waste from seven percent to below one percent after impurity removal. It can also ensure that the cotton fibers in the cotton waste are not damaged, maintaining their original tensile strength and ensuring the quality of the cotton yarn. At the same time, the fiber impurity separator also has high production efficiency, with one machine capable of processing more than 1,000 pounds of cotton waste per day. In this way, it is possible to utilize cotton waste on a large scale for spinning yarn and weaving cloth without reducing its use value. Taking Qingfeng Yarn Factory as an example, it can save 480,000 jin of cotton per year. This cotton can be spun into more than 1,200 pieces of yarn and woven into 48,000 bolts of cloth.

    无锡庆丰纱厂职工创制纤维杂质分离机
    无锡市私营庆丰纱厂技术人员李嘉谋、蔡增明和工人戴阿炳、范金根等发挥技术革新精神，创制纤维杂质分离机成功。这对棉纺织厂大量利用斩抄花，降低原棉的消耗量提供了有效的办法。
    这部机器的除杂效能很高，可使下脚花中百分之七的含杂率，经过除杂后降低到百分之一以下；并可使花衣纤维不受损伤，保持原有拉力，保证棉纱质量。同时，纤维杂质分离机的生产效率也很高，一部机器每天可处理一千多磅下脚花。这样，就能够在不降低使用价值的原则下，大量利用下脚花来纺纱和织布，单以庆丰纱厂来计算，每年就可以节省四十八万斤棉花，这些棉花可以纺出一千二百多件纱，织成四万八千匹布。
