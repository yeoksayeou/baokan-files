Farmers in the Shawan area of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, have launched a spring afforestation and reforestation campaign to eliminate wind and sand disasters and ensure bumper harvests. According to preliminary statistics, 3,687 mu of forest have been planted and more than 2.3 million trees have been planted in the Shawan area. Many farmers are also planting trees on their own land, field edges, roadsides, and around villages. For example, farmers in Hongshan Township, Fifth District of Dali, have planted more than 50,000 trees. In order to solve the need for seedlings for future afforestation, in addition to mobilizing the masses to cultivate seedlings sporadically, the Shawan Afforestation Station has cultivated more than 10 mu of fruit seedlings in the state-owned nursery, and also plans to entrust the masses to cultivate more than 500 mu of seedlings. At present, it is looking for seedling cultivation targets and signing contracts. (Liu Zhennan)

    陕西省沙苑地区农民
    开展春季造林育林工作
    陕西省关中沙苑地区农民，为了消灭风沙灾害，保障农田丰收，开展了春季造林育林工作。据初步统计沙苑地区已造林三千六百八十七亩，植树二百三十多万株。还有许多农民在自己地头田畔、路旁村边植树，大荔五区洪善乡农民就植树五万多株。为了解决今后造林所需苗木，除发动群众零星育苗外，沙苑造林站在国营苗圃培育果苗十多亩，还计划委托群众育苗五百多亩，目前正在物色育苗对象和订立合同。　（刘振南）
