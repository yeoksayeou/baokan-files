On the eve of "May Day," Beijing is already showing a distinct festive atmosphere everywhere.

Spring has decorated Beijing so beautifully. The magnificent Tiananmen Square, the symbol of the motherland's peace and victory that hundreds of millions of hearts yearn for, glows with solemn and magnificent radiance under the spring sunshine. The two huge slogans and six grandstands installed on the vermilion palace walls have been repainted. The dazzling lighting equipment embedded in the solemn national emblem of the People's Republic of China on the Tiananmen Gate tower, the three hundred and twenty spotlights spanning Tiananmen Square, and the many loudspeakers distributed throughout the square have all been installed. Huge oil portraits of the revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and a huge oil portrait of Chairman Mao are being installed. Along the wide, tree-lined avenues of East and West Chang'an Street, the green trees are lush, and the spring is strong. On the central islands, the green grass has become a carpet, and the roadside gardens are in full bloom with lilacs. Hardworking gardeners are carefully planting various fruit trees, shrubs, and flowers to green the capital in parks, squares, and tree-lined avenues. Gardeners at Zhongshan Park have also specially cultivated dozens of pots of large, rich pink peonies, peach blossoms, begonias, and fragrant magnolias, all in bud, for the "May Day" Tiananmen reviewing stand.

Workers in major factories and construction sites in Beijing are enthusiastically launching labor competitions. All employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have enthusiastically plunged into the climax of the "May Day" labor competition. Employees of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Center construction area are guaranteeing to complete the iron tower project at the highest part of the central hall of the exhibition hall before "May Day," and to install a large, radiant red star on the gilded top of the iron tower as a "May Day" gift. Employees of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are enthusiastically launching a production competition in the same trade and have completed the assembly task of universal milling machines for April ahead of schedule.

The city's workers will form a huge procession of over 100,000 people to participate in the holiday parade. Employees of various factories and mines are rushing to produce various production charts and models to show the great achievements they have created in realizing national industrialization in the first year of the country's first five-year plan. Beijing railway workers have made models of locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, bridges, tunnels, etc., and rushed to produce huge charts such as the progress chart of traffic mileage. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has produced four huge charts to illustrate the plant's over-fulfillment of the production of pig iron, coke, cast pipes, and toluene in the first quarter of this year. Employees of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are making models of universal milling machines, and the Beijing People's Machinery Plant is also rushing to make models of tower cranes. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant has produced models of rocker harvesters and double-wheel double-share plows, and has specially produced a huge chart showing the cost reduction and price reduction of the No. 22 step plow produced by the plant.

The Central Ministry of Light Industry has prepared large models of cigarettes, beer, rubber, medicine, etc., indicating that the light industry sector is creating more products to meet the growing needs of the people's lives.

This year, the capital's business community has also prepared six large charts to illustrate the production improvement of private industrial and commercial enterprises after embarking on the road of state capitalism. After the joint state-private ownership of the Beijing Green Treasure Fountain Pen Factory, production increased by 45%. After accepting state processing orders, the production volume of the Beijing Private Tongyi Water Pump Factory and the Chuqi Paper Mill increased significantly.

The young students of various schools in Beijing are welcoming this fighting festival with even more fiery enthusiasm. They have prepared huge slogan paintings for learning from the Soviet Union and huge models for implementing "good health, good study, and good work," as well as models for various professional studies, to express their ambition to accelerate learning and prepare to participate in the country's socialist construction. The flowers of unlimited hope in the new China—the happy children of the Chinese Young Pioneers—will bring thousands of peace doves and thousands of colored balloons to Tiananmen Square to add to the happiness, peace, and beautiful scenery of the festival.
