Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced in the Council of States on April 22nd that India would not allow US Air Force planes to carry French troops over Indian territory.

In the Council of States, a question was raised requesting attention to the news that the US Air Force had been using its planes to carry French troops to the Indochina battlefield. The questioner said that India is located on this route, and it is very likely that American planes will violate its airspace or fly over Indian territory, and therefore wanted to know what actions the Indian government intends to take or has already taken in this matter.

Nehru replied that the Indian government's policy "for the past five or six years has been not to allow any foreign troops to pass through India, whether by flying over or by other means."

Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: TASS, Paris, April 22nd: Agence France-Presse reported: As a result of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's decision not to allow planes carrying reinforcements from the French Union forces to Indochina to fly over Indian territory, the French command is facing new problems that are apparently difficult to solve. If the planes cannot land in Ceylon, they can take another route south of India, using Diego Garcia Island in the Chagos Archipelago as a stopover. However, according to Agence France-Presse, there probably will not be an airfield on this archipelago capable of accommodating "Douglas C-124" transport planes. Therefore, the only remaining route is via the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, passing through New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, Guam, and Manila, with a total length of 26,000 kilometers, while the route via India is only 12,000 kilometers.

### 印度总理尼赫鲁宣布  印度不许美国空军载运法军飞越印度国境

    印度总理尼赫鲁宣布
    印度不许美国空军载运法军飞越印度国境
    【新华社二十三日讯】据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁四月二十二日在联邦院宣布印度不允许美国空军飞机载运法国军队飞越印度国境。
    在联邦院中，有人提出问题，要求注意美国空军已经用它们的飞机载运法国军队到印度支那战场去的消息。提出问题的人说，印度位于这条路上，美国飞机很有可能侵犯领空或是飞过印度的领土，因而希望知道印度政府对此事拟采取或已经采取了什么行动。
    尼赫鲁回答说：印度政府的政策“过去五六年来一向是不许任何外国军队通过印度，不论是从空中飞越或用其他方法通过”。
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：据法新社报道：由于印度总理尼赫鲁决定不允许空运前往印度支那增援的法兰西联邦部队的飞机飞越印度国境，法国司令部面临着新的问题，这个问题显然很难解决。假如飞机不能在锡兰着陆，还可以另外取道印度以南的航线，以查哥斯群岛第亚哥加西亚岛为中途降落站。然而，据法新社说，在这群岛上，大概不会有能够容纳“道格拉斯C—124”型运输机降落的飞机场。因此，余下的航线只有一条，那就是取道大西洋和太平洋，这条航线途经纽约、旧金山、檀香山、关岛和马尼拉，全长两万六千公里，而途经印度的航线只有一万二千公里。
