A Rural Teacher in the Mouth of a Farmer
Shan Chuan, Wang Dexing

Do you know Shancheyu? It's in Luonan County, southern Shaanxi. This valley is thirty li long, leading directly to the foot of the Qinling Mountains, with cliffs and peaks on both sides, and cobblestones everywhere on the road. In the past, there was a ballad that said:

	Walking into Shancheyu, every step treads on stones,
	I'm not afraid of stones, but grain and money cause woes.

At that time, we farmers couldn't even get enough corn mush to eat, let alone learn to read. None of the eighty-seven households in the entire valley were literate.

After liberation, the People's Government cared about the farmers in the mountainous areas and set up a primary school in an empty house in the valley. This was really a great joy! The old people smacked their lips and said: Since ancient times, our people in the valley have wielded sickles and carried shoulder poles, and have tasted the bitterness of illiteracy. From now on, we must all let our children go to school. But strangely, the teachers who were invited all complained that the mountains were high, the slopes were steep, and there were too many stones. They were not used to drinking corn mush and left the valley after living for only a few days.

In the spring of 1952, another primary school teacher came to the valley. His name was Wang Huamin, about forty years old, of medium build, wearing a pair of hemp shoes and leggings, and a coarse cloth jacket and trousers. As soon as he arrived in the valley, he didn't mind the conditions. He carried water, swept the floor, and cooked his own meals. Looking at his appearance, he was no different from the people in the mountains. At that time, I wondered in my heart: He is a good person, but I don't know how his knowledge is? Can he teach the children well?

One day, I had to go to Tongguan City. As I passed the school gate, I heard Teacher Wang teaching a lesson, with a loud and low voice:

	Good children, good children, don't step on the crops when you walk,
	Don't burn corn stalks or steal melons, and don't waste bean pods for nothing.

Then I heard him explain to the students: "The crops are all planted by our uncles and elders. They don't know how much hard work it took. We must never waste them..." As I listened, I suddenly remembered something that happened not long ago. Wu Jinbao, an old man in our valley, had an only son named Yangwa, twelve years old, who had been spoiled since childhood. When he returned home from school, he didn't like to move. When Teacher Wang learned about this, he went to Wu Jinbao twice, regardless of the high mountains and long roads. He said: "You can't spoil Yangwa too much. He can't do heavy work, so he should learn to sweep the yard and pick up firewood." He often said to Yangwa: "You should work hard. When a person is born into society, is it better to be a labor model or a lazy person?" Later, Yangwa did whatever he saw when he returned home and listened very well.

In the summer of the year when Teacher Wang first entered the valley, he was strolling in the wild one day when he saw two members of Zhang Jinming's mutual aid team arguing. He went over to ask and learned that the reason for the argument was that the team's work points had not been calculated clearly. After helping to calm the argument, he said to Zhang Jinming: "This is all because you don't know how to record work points and calculate accounts. I'll help you from now on!"

From then on, two new account books were added to Teacher Wang's desk, which was full of students' homework books. Every day, as soon as it got dark, Zhang Jinming would come to him; he would help him record the accounts neatly and settle them every ten days or half a month.

Once, after finishing recording the accounts, he asked Zhang Jinming: "What do you think it takes to be a good team leader?"

  "Do you even need to ask?" Zhang Jinming replied without thinking:
  "As long as you get up early, are diligent, and tell people to go up the mountain to dig, that's right."
  "That won't work, that's far from enough! In my opinion, to be a good team leader, you must first be able to give everyone ideas and find ways to make the land produce more grain and turn our poor valley into a rich valley. This requires learning good methods from others."

Zhang Jinming was a young man and jumped up and said, "That's right! That's clear now, I must study hard in the future. Can you teach us to learn to read?"

Teacher Wang said: "Don't rush, there are many illiterate people in our valley. It would be great to set up a people's school."

Teacher Wang later discussed it with the village chief and established a people's school in August of that year. More than thirty people signed up. I also participated in the study. He taught the children during the day and the adults at night. His work was busy enough. But he! He was both hardworking and patient, and wholeheartedly taught the children and adults well.

Because the people in the valley had not studied, they were really not used to recognizing characters at first. They always forgot things. Picking up a pen felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. I thought: I am almost thirty years old, it doesn't matter if I learn or not, and I wanted to retreat.

It's strange, I didn't go to the people's school for two nights, but Teacher Wang came to my door.

At dusk, the valley was foggy, and Teacher Wang came to the eaves of my house with a lantern. Before entering the door, he asked me, "Why haven't you come these past two days? Do you think the way I teach is stupid?"

My face turned red and I hurriedly argued, "No, no. It's just that my brain is not working and I can't remember."

He smiled and said, "Learning to read can't be rushed, take your time. As long as you put in the effort, an iron rod can be ground into a needle. No one comes out of their mother's womb knowing how to read." He patted me on the shoulder and said, "You are only thirty years old, and you have a long life ahead of you. As long as you are willing to work hard, I guarantee that I will teach you well."

He talked about the benefits of learning to read for a while and then left in a hurry. I looked at his back and couldn't say a word for a long time. I thought: What is he doing this for? He ran six miles to call me, isn't it all for my own good!

At first, everyone's enthusiasm for learning was not great, and Teacher Wang knew this too, but he was not discouraged. He tried to find a way to teach everyone. Soon, he bought a few new opera scripts and sang and explained them at the same time. Slowly, everyone had confidence again. In less than half a year, I learned a few sections of opera lyrics and also recognized more than two hundred new characters.

Teacher Wang stayed in our valley for two years, carrying water and cooking his own meals every day, working hard day and night, and never mentioned leaving the valley. He not only taught the children to write and calculate and be diligent and thrifty, but also taught us farmers to become cultured people. Take Zhang Jinming as an example. In the past, he didn't know a single character, but now he can write down the names of everyone in the valley and no longer has to worry about recording work points and calculating accounts for the team. There is also Li Changshi, who used to not be able to make a figure eight with his hands, but this year, strangely enough, he wrote a couplet on his own door for the Spring Festival. The upper line was "Work hard to produce a good life", and the lower line was "Mutual aid and cooperation to produce more grain". In the past, no one could recognize official documents from the township, but now all eight mutual aid teams have subscribed to the "Shaanxi Peasant News", and people are reading it with a rustling sound.

Teacher Wang's contributions are numerous. Last year, when the People's Government purchased grain, he used his spare time to go from house to house, publicizing the general line everywhere, so that everyone could see clearly. Usually, he was also very concerned about the affairs of the valley. Whoever wanted to write a note or a military family member wanted to write a letter, as long as someone asked him, even if it was during mealtime, he would put down his bowl.

Why doesn't he dislike this remote place? Why is he so helpful and helpful to everyone? I think this is because he likes the people in our valley. He only looks forward and doesn't look back.

Last winter, when the school was about to go on vacation, people were worried that the superiors would transfer him to another place. The villagers discussed and wrote a letter to the township People's Government, asking them not to transfer Teacher Wang and to keep him in the valley to teach forever. When he learned about this, he came to us one day and said, "After studying the general line, I am even clearer in my heart. Our mountain valley can also establish agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives and move towards socialism step by step. At that time, the people who will be the directors and accountants of the cooperative, and the agricultural technicians... may all be the students of today! As long as the work needs it, I want to be with everyone forever."

How far-sighted Teacher Wang is!

    一个农民口里的乡村教师
    山川　王德兴
    你知道善车峪吗？它在陕南的雒南县境内。这条峪道长三十里，直通秦岭山下，两旁是悬崖高峰，道上到处是鹅卵石。从前，有段歌谣说：
        走进善车峪，步步踏石头，
        石头我不怕，粮款叫人愁。
    那时节，咱庄稼人连顿包谷糊都喝不饱，更谈不上学文化了。全峪八十七户人家没有一个识字的。
    解放以后，人民政府关心山区农民，利用峪里的一座空房设立了一所小学校。这真是一件大喜事！老人们咂咂嘴说：自古以来，咱峪里人耍镰弄扁担，都尝过不识字的苦处，今后都得叫娃娃去念书。可怪，请来的教师一个个嫌这里山高坡陡石头多，不习惯喝包谷糊，住不了多少日子就出峪了。
    一九五二年春天，峪里又来了个小学教师。他叫王化民，年纪有四十上下，中等身材，脚上穿着一双麻鞋，裹着绑腿，穿一身粗布袄裤。他一到峪，不嫌长短，自己担水、扫地、做饭，看他那副神气跟山里人不相上下。当时，我心里捉摸着：人倒是个好人，不知学问怎么样？能不能把娃娃教好？
    有一天，我有事去潼关城，路过学校门口，听到王老师正在教课哩，高一声、低一句的：
    好娃娃，好娃娃，走路不能踏庄稼，
    不烧包谷不偷瓜，豆荚不能白糟踏。
    又听他向学生讲解说：“庄稼全由咱伯叔们种下的，不知费了多大辛苦，咱们绝不能胡浪费。……”我听着听着，猛然记起了不久前发生的一件事。我们峪里吴进宝老汉，有个独子叫羊娃，十二岁，从小骄生惯养，从学校回到家里就不爱动弹。这事叫王老师晓得了，他不顾山高路远，亲自找吴进宝两次，他说：“对羊娃，不能太溺爱，他重活做不了，扫院、拾柴该让他学着做。”他又常对羊娃说：“你该好好劳动哩，一个人生在社会上，当个劳动模范好，还是当个懒汉好？”后来，羊娃回到家里见啥做啥，满听话的。
    王老师刚进峪的那年夏季，有一天他在野外蹓跶，看见峪里张金明互助组的两个组员在争吵。他前去一问，知道争吵的原因是组里的工账没有算清楚。他帮着平息了口角以后，对张金明说：“这都吃亏在不会记工算账，往后我帮你们好啦！”
    从这以后，王老师的那只堆满学生作业本的桌子上，新添了两本账簿子。每天天一黑，张金明就来找他；他就帮助把账记得整整齐齐的，每隔十天半月，还要结算一次。
    有一次在记完了账以后，他问张金明：“你说该怎样才能当个好组长？”
      “那还用你问？”张金明毫不考虑地回答：
  “只要起的早，腿勤些，叫人上山挖地就对了。”
      “这不行，差得远呢！依我看，当个好组长首先要能给大伙出主意，想办法，叫地里多打粮，把咱这穷峪变富峪。这就得学习人家的好办法。”
    张金明是个年轻小伙，跳起来说：“对！可亮清了，我今后要好好学习。你能教咱学文化吗？”
    王老师说：“甭忙，咱峪里不识字的人多着哩，成立个民校看多好。”
    王老师后来跟村长研究好了，就在那年八月成立了民校，报名的有三十多个。我也参加了学习。他白日教娃娃，黑里教大人，工作也够忙的。可是他呀，嘿！既能吃苦，又耐烦，实心实意把娃娃、大人都教好。
    峪里的人因没念过书，刚开始认字真不习惯，总是丢东忘西，提起笔像有千斤重。我想：咱是近三十岁的人了，学不学没啥相干，心想打“退堂鼓”。
    你说怪不怪，我两晚上没去民校，王老师却上门找来了。
    黄昏，峪里雾气腾腾，王老师提了个灯笼来到我家房檐下，没进门他就问我：“这两天怎么不来？是不是嫌我教的法子笨？”
    我脸上直发烧，忙分辩：“不是，不是。怪咱脑筋不灵醒，认不进去。”
    他笑了笑说：“学文化不能性急，慢慢来。只要工夫深，铁杵磨成针，谁从娘肚子出来就能认得字。”他拍着我的肩膀又说：“你才三十岁的人，往后日子还长哩。只要肯下苦工，我管保叫你学好。”
    他又讲了一阵学文化的好处，就匆匆忙忙地走了。我看着他的背影，半天说不出话来。我想：人家是为的啥呢？跑了六里路来叫咱，还不是为咱好！
    开始大伙的学习劲头不大，王老师也晓得这一点，可是他不灰心，想法寻窍道要教会大家。不久，他买了几册新戏本，一边唱，一边讲。慢慢地大伙又有了信心。没过半年，我学会几段戏词，也认会了二百多个生字。
    王老师在我们峪里停了两年，每天自己担水做饭，没明没黑地苦干，从来没提过出峪的话。他不光把娃娃们教得个个能写能算，做活勤俭，还把我们庄稼汉也教成有文化的人了。就拿张金明来说吧。过去他一字不识，如今能写下全峪人的名字，再也不愁组里记工算账的事了。还有李长世，过去双手划不成八字，今年可怪，春节时给自己家门上写了副对联，上联是“努力生产光景好”，下联是
  “互助合作多打粮”。过去，乡里来了公文没人会认，如今八个互助组都订了“陕西农民报”，人们念起来哗哗哗的。
    王老师的功劳多得很。去年，人民政府统购粮食时，他一有闲空，东家门出，西家门进，到处宣传总路线，使大伙心明眼亮。平常，他对峪里的事儿也挺关心。谁要写个条条啦，军属要写封信啦，只要有人请他，就是在吃饭的时候，他也会把碗撩下。
    他为啥不嫌这里偏僻？他为啥那么替众人出力办事？我看，这是因为他喜欢俺峪里人，他只往前走，不往后看。
    去年冬天，学校快放假的时候，人们都耽心着，怕上级把他调到别地方去。乡亲们商量好，给乡人民政府写了一封信，要求不要调走王老师，永远留他在峪里教书。这事给他知道了，有一天走来对我们说：“学习了总路线，我心里更豁亮了。咱这山沟沟也能成立农林牧生产合作社，一步步走向社会主义。那时候，当社长、会计的，当农业技术人员的……说不定尽是现在的学生娃哩！只要工作需要，我要和大家永远在一起。”
    王老师的眼光看得多么远啊！
