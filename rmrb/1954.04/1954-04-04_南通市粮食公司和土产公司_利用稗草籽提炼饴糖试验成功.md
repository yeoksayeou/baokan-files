Nantong City Grain Company and Native Produce Company
Successfully Experiment with Refining Maltose from Barnyard Grass Seeds

The Nantong City Grain Company and Native Produce Company of Jiangsu Province, acting on the suggestion of Zhang Yongshan, a worker at the private Dalongxie Sugar Workshop, successfully experimented with refining maltose from barnyard grass seeds. Mass production began on March 6th.

Barnyard grass seeds, also known as "San Grass Seeds," are the seeds of a wild crop mixed in with rice. In the past, large quantities of barnyard grass seeds accumulated in rice mills were either used to fill "wasteland ponds" or thrown into rivers.

This March, the Nantong Native Produce Company has already used nearly 40,000 jin of barnyard grass seeds to produce maltose. On average, 100 jin of barnyard grass seeds can produce 70 jin of maltose, which is 8 percent higher than the sugar yield from broken rice. After trial use by relevant departments, the first batch of maltose proved to be of excellent quality, with bright color, and its taste was even sweeter and fresher than maltose made from broken rice.

According to statistics from the Nantong City Grain Company, based on the city's rice processing figures for this year, it is estimated that 280,000 jin of barnyard grass seeds can be collected this year. If the entire province can collect and utilize all barnyard grass seeds in the future, it is estimated that millions of jin of maltose can be produced annually, which will add a significant amount of wealth to the country.

The method and process for processing barnyard grass seeds into maltose are the same as the method for processing ordinary broken rice into maltose, and no additional equipment is required.

    南通市粮食公司和土产公司
    利用稗草籽提炼饴糖试验成功
    江苏省南通市粮食公司及土产公司接受私营大隆协制糖作坊工人张永山的建议，利用稗草籽提炼饴糖成功，三月六日起已开始大量生产。
    稗草籽，又名“糁草籽”，是夹杂在稻谷中的一种野生作物的种籽。过去机米厂里积存下来的大量稗草籽不是被用于填“荒塘”便是被抛到河里去。
    今年三月里，南通土产公司已先后利用了近四万斤稗草籽制饴糖。平均每百斤稗草籽可产饴糖七十斤，比碎米的产糖率高百分之八。第一批饴糖经有关部门试用后，证明质量优良，色泽鲜艳，其味还比碎米饴糖甜美新鲜。
    据南通市粮食公司统计，以该市今年加工稻谷的数字推算，估计今年可聚集稗草籽二十八万斤；今后全省如能把全部稗草籽聚集起来加以利用，估计每年可产饴糖数百万斤，将为国家增加一笔很大的财富。
    稗草籽加工饴糖的方法和过程与普通碎米加工饴糖的办法相同，不需要添置设备。
