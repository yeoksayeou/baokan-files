Reporting Upwards for Reimbursement Versus Handling Independently
　　Xu Gongran
　　A document issued by the Hubei Province Qichun County Cooperative traveled through three levels of government—county, special district, and province—and seven processing agencies. From September of last year to February of this year, it traveled back and forth for one hundred and fifty-three days, but the problem has not been resolved.
　　In the first half of last year, the Qichun County Cooperative, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, purchased a batch of non-staple food—dried radish slices. In addition to what was submitted, there were more than 3,900 catties that did not meet the requirements and could not be handed over. At that time, the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee stipulated that the non-standard parts could be sold locally, and if they could not be sold at the purchase price, the price difference from selling at a reduced price could be reported for resolution. In accordance with the instructions, the Qichun County Cooperative promoted the sale of the radish slices.
　　Subsequently, in September of last year, the Qichun County Cooperative wrote a document to the County Financial and Economic Committee, requesting a resolution for the loss of over seven million yuan. Thus, the document's journey began.
　　After receiving this document, the Qichun County Financial and Economic Committee forwarded it to the Huanggang Special District Financial and Economic Committee; the Huanggang Special District Financial and Economic Committee sent the document to the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee. The Cooperation and Trade Section of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee then forwarded it to the Provincial Cooperative Affairs Bureau. The document was held up in the Cooperative Affairs Bureau for forty-three days, and on November 3rd, it was returned to the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee along with a letter, stating that this work was directly arranged by the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee. The document returned to the Cooperation and Trade Section. The section chief, seeing that the task was directly assigned to the Provincial Local Trade Company and the Cooperative, and that the Cooperative could settle with the Local Trade Company, which would then report for reimbursement, sent the document to the Provincial Local Trade Company. The document was held up in the Provincial Local Trade Company for sixty-nine days, and on February 11th of this year, it was handed over to the Administrative Finance Section of the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance. The Finance Section's opinion was: "Reduce the price for sale, no reimbursement will be given, please resolve it yourself." The document was then transferred through the Provincial Local Trade Company back to the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee. On February 13th, the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee transferred the document from the Qichun County Financial and Economic Committee and the correspondence handling this document together to the Huanggang Special District Financial and Economic Committee, writing in the letter: "...Regarding the problem of the Qichun County Cooperative under your district incurring losses in purchasing radish slices, you should handle it yourself."
　　This document, which traveled back and forth for one hundred and fifty-three days, thus ended its journey. However, the Qichun County Cooperative's loss is still an unsolved case.

    向上报销和自行处理
  　徐公然
    湖北省蕲春县合作社发出了一件公文，经过县、专区、省三级政府和七个处理机关，从去年九月到今年二月，往返旅行了一百五十三天，但问题还没有得到解决。
    去年上半年，蕲春县合作社依照省财政经济委员会的指示，收购了一批副食品——萝卜片，除上交之外，还有三千九百多斤因为不合要求，交不上去。当时，省财政经济委员会曾规定：不合规格的部分，可以就地出售，如不能按购价出售者，降价出售的差额可以上报解决。依照指示，蕲春县合作社就把萝卜片推销出去。
    接着，蕲春县合作社就在去年九月向县财政经济委员会写了一件公文，请求解决亏损的七百多万元的款项。于是，公文旅行就此开始。
    蕲春县财政经济委员会在接到这件公文后，就转给黄冈专区财政经济委员会；黄冈专区财政经济委员会把公文送给了省财政经济委员会。省财政经济委员会合作贸易科就批转给省合作事业管理局，公文在合作事业管理局扣压了四十三天，到十一月三日又连信带公文退给了省财政经济委员会，理由是这项工作是省财政经济委员会直接布置的。文件又回到了合作贸易科，科长一看这个任务是直接布置给省地方贸易公司和合作社的，合作社可向地方贸易公司结算，由省地方贸易公司上报报销，就把公文又送到省地方贸易公司。公文又在省地方贸易公司压了六十九天，到今年二月十一日又交给了湖北省财政厅行政财务科，财务科的处理意见是：“减价出售，不予报销，请自行解决”。就把公文经省地方贸易公司再转到省财政经济委员会。二月十三日省财政经济委员会就把蕲春县财政经济委员会的公文及处理这一公文的便函一起转给了黄冈专区财政经济委员会，信上写着：“……关于你区所属蕲春县合作社收购萝卜片赔本的问题，应由你们自行处理。”
    这件往返旅行一百五十三天的公文，至此结束了它的旅程。可是蕲春县合作社亏损的款子，至今还是件悬案。
