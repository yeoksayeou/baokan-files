The Disaster of American "Aid"
    Wu Fei

    In Turkey, under American "aid," the income of the people is decreasing, while prices are increasing. Even the "New Istanbul Newspaper" has to admit this fact, saying, "The price of goods is so high that it is a miracle that people can live here." Because the price of goods is too high and they cannot survive, many people are forced to sell their sons and daughters, and human traffickers are openly active. The "Republic Newspaper" frankly says: "Everywhere in Turkey, you can encounter unfortunate mothers selling their children..."
    The peasants, whose lives were already very difficult, have seen hundreds of thousands more go bankrupt as a result of the US forcing Turkey to reduce its exports of tobacco and cotton. According to the "Evening News," "The vast majority of Turkish farmers are forced to leave their homes and go to the cities to make a living." All of this is the disaster that the so-called American "aid" has brought to the Turkish people. Not long ago, the magazine "Today Bulgaria" published the following cartoon, which very well illustrates the attitude of the Turkish people towards American "aid."

　　美国“援助”的灾难
    吴非
    在美国“援助”下的土耳其，人民的收入越来越少，而物价却越来越高，这一事实连“新伊斯坦布尔报”也不得不承认了，该报说“物价昂贵达到了如此程度：人们能够在这里生活简直是一种奇迹。”由于物价昂贵，无法生活，不少的人被迫卖儿鬻女，人口贩子在公开活动。“共和国报”直率地说：“在土耳其到处都可以遇到出卖子女的不幸的母亲……”
    本来生活十分困苦的农民，因为美国强迫土耳其减少烟草和棉花出口的结果，又有几十万农民破产了。据“晚报”报道：“绝大多数的土耳其农民被迫背井离乡到城市去谋生。”所有这些，都是美国的所谓“援助”给土耳其人民带来的灾难。不久之前“今日保加利亚”杂志上刊载了如下一幅漫画，这幅漫画极好地说明了土耳其人民对美国“援助”的态度。
