    朝鲜访华团代表在成都
    慰问了黄继光烈士的母亲
    据新华社讯：朝鲜人民访华代表团和朝鲜人民军协奏团，在副团长李永镐和李东英率领下，十一日上午在成都慰问了黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝。
    黄妈妈热情地招待了这些英雄人民的使者。代表团向黄妈妈献了鲜花。李永镐副团长向黄妈妈致慰问词。他说：“我们朝鲜人民永远不会忘记您的儿子所建立的永垂不朽的丰功伟绩，它将和中国人民志愿军建立的功勋一起，永被传颂，千秋万代。”黄妈妈也感激地说：“我在家里常常想见英雄的朝鲜人民，想见英勇的朝鲜人民军的英雄战士们。今天你们来了，我心里万分高兴。”贵宾们围住黄妈妈坐下来，问长问短像一家人似的谈着话。代表团团员、朝鲜人民军军官、“共和国英雄”张贤化把一枚金日成纪念章佩戴在黄妈妈胸前。代表们一个个热烈地和黄妈妈握手、拥抱，临别时依依不舍。
