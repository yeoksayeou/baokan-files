The Most Lovable People's Liberation Army

Saving Warehouse Materials from Fire

On January 27th this year, at around 5:00 PM, the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed near a certain railway station had just started dinner when a sharp fire alarm sounded, "Woo! Woo!"

The deputy company commander immediately assembled the troops and rushed to put out the fire. It turned out that the department store's warehouse nearby was on fire. Workers from several nearby factories also arrived one after another.

At this time, the fire was already raging, and flames were spewing from the warehouse windows, curling towards the roof, and tiles on the eaves were flying everywhere. A worker tried to rush into the warehouse to rescue things but was pushed back by the flames. Seeing this, soldier Chen Zhenshan was very worried. He thought: We save every piece of paper and every ounce of material to accumulate funds for national construction; how can we just watch the state's property being destroyed by fire! He gritted his teeth and plunged into the warehouse despite the flames. In the smoke, he saw that many materials had not yet been burned. He immediately picked up a large box and walked out. Following Chen Zhenshan, many soldiers plunged into the flames to rescue materials. At this time, workers from a certain factory brought over a fire engine. The soldiers took basins and buckets to add water to the fire engine. The workers, holding the nozzle of the water hose, shouted: "Comrades, wherever you go, the water will support you there, guaranteeing to follow you!" Chen Zhenshan's body caught fire, and squad leader Liu Dingzhang pulled him out, put out the fire with water, and sprayed him all over to wet him; he immediately plunged back into the fire to rescue dye barrels. Soon, his cotton clothes were dried again, half of his face was burned, and he suddenly fainted in the fire. The deputy company commander quickly rescued him, but when Chen Zhenshan regained consciousness, he got up and rushed to the warehouse again, continuously rescuing two bundles of cloth, and then he carried a large bucket of dye outwards, when he was suddenly knocked down by the fire. When people rescued him, he had completely lost consciousness.

The selfless and heroic actions of the PLA soldiers encouraged everyone to work even harder to rescue the materials. During the tense moment, the main beam suddenly "crashed" down, blocking the warehouse door. Machine gunner Tian Yongchang immediately went to drag the beam away. At this time, a large piece of the roof collapsed again, hitting his arm. He endured the pain and still pulled the beam outwards. With the help of his comrades, he finally dragged the beam out and opened the passage. Tian Yongchang immediately plunged back into the fire to rescue materials. At this time, bundles of paper caught fire, so he rolled on the paper bundles with his body to put out the fire, and then carried the paper out bundle by bundle. Soon, dozens of bundles of paper were rescued from the fire. Then he went to rescue cloth until he fainted in the warehouse. When the workers quickly rescued him, he was still shouting in a coma: "Comrades, there's still more inside!"

In this way, after rescuing for more than three hours, the fire was finally extinguished, rescuing a large number of materials for the country. At this time, the cotton clothes of the soldiers of the Fourth Company were all burnt black, and everyone's face was burned red and black. But everyone's face showed a pleasant smile.

Excellent Shooter

December, the fierce north wind rolled up the sky-covering sand and dust, covering the entire training ground of a certain PLA unit like a layer of clouds. Seen from a distance, one could vaguely see the figure of a soldier on the training ground, tightly gripping a light machine gun with both hands, sometimes lying down, sometimes standing up, sometimes kneeling... In that overwhelming dust and piercing cold wind, he practiced attentively as if nothing had happened.

This soldier, named Tong Minglu, is a machine gunner in the Fifth Squad of the First Company of a certain PLA unit. In 1953, he was awarded a third-class merit for his excellent training performance. Last year, when he studied the Party's general line for the transition period, he worked even harder in both study and practice. Once, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch said to him: "Xiao Tong! You practice even more diligently than before!" He replied: "Since I learned the general line, it seems that socialism is right in front of me. If I don't quickly master my weapons and learn my skills well, how can I protect socialist construction well!"

In January of this year, a sore the size of a bowl suddenly grew under Tong Minglu's armpit. He thought: "This is really bad luck, isn't this deliberately preventing me from participating in training?" The squad leader knew that he had a sore and told him to rest well at home every time before going to the training ground to practice. But when the squad leader led the team to the training ground, Tong Minglu also followed behind. The squad leader asked him to go back, but he asked in a firm and sincere tone: "Squad leader, let me stand aside and see how other comrades practice, it's also beneficial!" The squad leader saw that he asked so sincerely, so he had to agree to him. His hands didn't practice, but his eyes didn't rest. He carefully observed and studied every soldier's action.

As soon as his sore healed, the company called on the shooters to exercise their arm strength and do the "gun-raising" action. Although Tong Minglu's body had not fully recovered, he insisted on exercising. Finally, his arm strength became very strong. He could skillfully and correctly continuously raise the light machine gun eighty times. The soldiers in the company praised him for his "good arm strength."

One day in February, the regiment conducted a shooter assessment. When the commander called his name, Tong Minglu excitedly carried the light machine gun and stepped onto the shooting platform. The shooting team leader issued the order. He skillfully pulled the bolt, loaded the bullets, and aimed at the "human head target" one hundred meters away. With the sound of "Da, da, da!" three single-shot bursts, the bullets hit the target one by one, without any mistakes, and every action was completely correct.

As he exited the firing line, the commander came over and shook Tong Minglu's hand tightly, encouraging him: "Remember: To defend the socialist construction of the motherland, continue to work hard and train yourself to become a more excellent shooter." Back in the squad, the comrades also congratulated him on his achievements.

    最可爱的中国人民解放军
    火中抢救仓库物资
    今年一月二十七日下午五时许，驻某车站附近的中国人民解放军某部四连刚刚开饭，突然传来“呜！呜！”一阵尖锐的火警笛声。
    副连长马上集合队伍，赶去救火，原来是附近的百货公司仓库失火了。附近几个工厂的工人也先后赶到。
    这时火势已大，火舌从仓库的窗户里喷出来，卷向房顶，房檐上的瓦烧得四处奔飞。一个工人想扑进仓库去抢救东西，一下就被大火顶了出来。战士陈振山看见这种情况，非常着急。他想：我们一张纸、一两米地节约，为国家建设积累资金；怎么能眼看着国家的财产被火烧毁呢！他一咬牙就冒着大火扑进了仓库。在烟雾中，他看见有许多物资还没有被烧着，他随即搬起一口大箱子向外走。紧跟着陈振山很多战士都扑进火焰中去抢救物资。这时某工厂的工人抬来了一架救火机。战士们又拿着盆子、水桶向救火机内添水。工人同志掌握着水龙带龙头，高喊着：“同志们到那里，水龙支援到那里，保证跟着同志们！”陈振山身上着了火，被班长刘定章一把拉出来，用水把火扑灭，并把他的全身喷湿；他立刻又钻进火里去抢救染料筒。很快，他的棉衣又被烤干了，半个脸被烧伤了，突然晕倒在火里。副连长急忙把他救护出来，但当陈振山清醒过来时，他爬起来又扑到仓库里去连续抢救出二捆布，然后他又扛着一大桶染料往外走，这时一下被火扑倒了。当人们把他救出来时，他已完全失去了知觉。
    解放军战士这种忘我舍身的英勇行动，鼓舞着大家更加奋勇地进行抢救。正在紧张的当儿忽然大梁“哗啦”一声落了下来，把仓库门口堵住了。机枪班战士田永昌立即去拖大梁，这时房顶又塌下来一大块，砸在他的胳膊上，他忍着痛，还是把大梁往外拉，在同志们的帮助下，终于把大梁拖了出来，打开了通道。田永昌立刻又钻进火里去抢救。这时纸捆燃烧起来了，他就用身子把纸捆上的火滚灭，然后一捆一捆地把纸背了出来。不一会，几十捆纸也从火中抢救了出来。接着他又去抢救布匹，直到他晕倒在仓库里。当工人迅速把他救了出来时，他在昏迷中还在喊着：“同志们，里边还有呀！”
    就这样抢救了三个多钟头，终于扑灭了大火，为国家抢救出大批物资。这时，四连的战士们个个身上的棉衣烧得黑糊糊的，个个脸上被火烧得一块红、一块黑。但每个人的脸上却都流露着愉快的微笑。

    优秀的射击手
    十二月，凛冽的北风卷来了遮天蔽日的沙土，把解放军某部的整个教练场，笼罩得就像盖上了一层云雾一样。从远处望去，隐约地可以看见教练场上一个战士的身影，两手紧握着一挺轻机枪，一会儿卧倒，一会儿立起，一会儿跪下……在那漫天的尘沙和刺骨的寒风中，若无其事地、聚精会神地坚持操练。
    这个战士叫佟明禄，是解放军某部一连五班的机枪射手。一九五三年，他因为训练成绩优秀立过三等功。去年他学习党在过渡时期的总路线时，学习和操练都更努力了。有一次，青年团支部书记跟他说：“小佟！你比从前练得可更勤了！”他回答说：“自从我学了总路线后，好像社会主义就在我眼前似的，我不赶快练熟了武器，把本领学好，哪能保卫好社会主义建设呢！”
    今年一月，佟明禄腋窝下突然长了一个碗口大的疮，他想：“这可真倒霉，这不是存心不叫我参加操练吗？”班长知道他生了疮，每次到教练场去操练以前，都嘱咐他在家里好好休息。可是等班长带队到了教练场，佟明禄也在后头跟来了。班长让他回去，他以坚决而又恳切的口吻要求说：“班长，让我站在一边，看看别的同志怎样操练，也有好处呵！”班长看他要求得这样诚恳，就只好答应他。他的手不操练了，眼睛可没闲着。他用心地观摩和学习着每一个战士的动作。
    他的疮刚刚好，就赶上连里号召射手们锻炼臂力，做“举枪”动作。虽然佟明禄的身体还没完全复元，但他坚持锻炼，终于，他的臂力练得很大了。他能熟练、正确地连续举起轻机枪八十下，同连的战士都称赞他“好臂力”。
    二月里的一天，团里进行射手鉴定，当首长一叫他的名字，佟明禄兴奋地提着轻机枪，登上了射击台；射击组长发出口令，只见他在射击台上，熟练地拉开枪机，装上子弹，瞄好在一百公尺地方的“人头靶”。随着“哒、哒、哒！”三下单发射击的响声，子弹即一颗一颗地命中了靶，一点也没有失误，而且每项动作也都完全正确。
    在他退出了射击线时，首长过来紧握起佟明禄的手，勉励他说：“记住：为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，要继续努力，把自己锻炼成为一个更优秀的射击手。”回到班里，同志们也都纷纷祝贺他的成绩。  （周  抗）
