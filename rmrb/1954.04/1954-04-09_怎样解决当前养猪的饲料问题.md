How to Solve the Current Pig Feed Problem
Li Shihao, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Zhejiang Provincial People's Government

Editor's note: Currently, many regions are feeling a shortage of pig feed. The various methods for solving the pig feed problem provided in this article are very good and can be used for reference in various places. In addition, the method of feeding pigs with bean cake is not mentioned in this article. At present, farmers in many areas like to use bean cake as fertilizer. If this fertilizer application habit can be changed, and bean cake can be used as feed to accumulate more manure, and manure can be used on the land, this will solve the fertilizer problem and increase pig feed.

At present, pig feed is generally felt to be insufficient in Zhejiang Province. The most important reason for this situation is that since liberation, Zhejiang Province has achieved consecutive years of agricultural bumper harvests, farmers have increased their funds for raising pigs, and the People's Government has vigorously promoted pig raising and appropriately increased the price of pork, which has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs. The number of pigs in Zhejiang Province reached 3,320,904 in 1953, an increase of 19.4 percent over 1952. However, the production of feed has not adapted to the increase in pigs, thus creating a disconnect in the supply of pig feed.

In addition, under the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the precision of rice milling has been reduced, the bran yield has decreased, and farmers lack enough rice bran for raising pigs, which is also one of the reasons for the lack of pig feed.

The basic way to solve the current shortage of pig feed is to increase the production of grain and feed. In 1953, Zhejiang Province produced a total of 2,810,800,000 jin of barley, corn, sweet potatoes, and soybeans. If production can be increased by 10 percent on this basis, it can increase production by 281,080,000 jin. If calculated based on an average of 400 jin of refined feed needed per pig per year, it can solve the refined feed needed by 2 million pigs in four months. Secondly, more succulent feed and green feed should be planted. For example, last year, the Jinhua Prefectural Farm planted more than 50 mu of carrots, and the Chun'an County Farm used 18 mu of winter fallow land to plant carrots, etc., which solved the difficulty of insufficient feed. Therefore, if we can actively increase the production of grain and feed crops, the pig feed problem can be solved.

Now, the experience and methods of increasing pig feed are introduced as follows:

First, seize the opportunity to cultivate spring flower crops (Zhejiang farmers call small spring crops such as broad beans, peas, rape, and wheat "spring flowers," and green manure crops such as purple cloud clover and wild peas "grass seeds" - editor). Currently, spring flowers are in the growing season. If we can seize the time to drain and fertilize, we can increase the yield per unit area. In the past, counties in the Jinhua Prefecture planted barley, and counties in the Jiaxing Prefecture planted broad beans, mostly used to feed pigs. If these crops can be increased in production, they can increase part of the pig feed. Grass seeds are also a good feed, not only nutritious but also high in yield. Fresh grass seeds can be used as feed, and can also be dried and stored as dry feed. The weather has been cold this year, and grass seeds are growing relatively slowly. If we seize the opportunity to apply quick-acting fertilizers such as fertilizer powder and human manure to promote the rapid growth of grass seeds, it is possible to increase production by 400 to 500 jin per mu. Zhejiang Province has a total of 9.8 million mu of grass seed fields. If each mu increases production by 500 jin, the total is 4.9 billion jin. Calculating 5 jin of grass seeds as equivalent to 1 jin of refined feed, it can solve the feed needed by 2 million pigs in five months.

Second, use winter fallow land and land after carrot harvest to plant potatoes. Potatoes are the earliest maturing crop, and can be harvested in May and June. The highest yield per mu can reach 1,000 jin, and generally 400 to 500 jin can be harvested. They can be eaten and used to feed pigs. It is now the sowing season, and we should seize the time to sow in large quantities. In addition, planting pumpkins and beans on wasteland or the edges of fields and corners of houses can also be used as feed.

Third, collect light grains and make rice bran. Select the husks under the windmill, winnow away the empty husks, leave the light grains, and grind them into rice bran for use as feed. According to the inspection by Li Hexing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangdu Township, Linhai County, 30 jin of light grains can be selected from 100 jin of husks, which can be ground into 21 jin of rice bran. If various places can collect light grains well, it is also a way to supplement the shortage of refined feed.

Fourth, adopt the sweet potato vine regeneration method of cutting vines. The method of feeding pigs with sweet potato vines is widely used in various places. If the production of sweet potato vines can be increased, the supply of feed for pigs can be increased. The masses in Linhai, Wenling, Xianju and other counties use the sweet potato vine regeneration method. Each fen of land can harvest 800 jin within two months. Sweet potato land specially used for cutting vines is cut once every half month. After cutting, quick-acting topdressing fertilizer is applied, and it can be cut again after half a month. This can be continued for several months. Feeding a pig only requires two fen of land to solve the feed supply in one season.

Fifth, use wild plants such as wild grass, wild vegetables, and aquatic plants to feed pigs. If various regions can collect wild vegetables and aquatic plants and appropriately mix them with refined feed, the amount of refined feed used can be reduced. Linhai County's Yangdu Township's specific time arrangement for using wild vegetables and aquatic plants is as follows: January to February, sweet potato vines and sweet potato residue; March to April, grass seeds, water hyacinth, and field shepherd's purse; May to June, grass seeds, water celery, artemisia selengensis, and red hyacinth; July to September, pickled grass seeds, taro stalks, radish vegetables, and scolopendra hyacinth; October to December, dried sweet potatoes, taro stalks, radish vegetables, various wild grasses, and scolopendra hyacinth.

Sixth, improve feeding management methods, pay attention to the combination of refined and coarse feed, and appropriately allocate feed in stages, which can save refined feed. For example, Yu Yueqin, a breeder at Chun'an County Farm, achieved stage feeding and rational feed allocation, saving 32% to 47% of refined feed. Cai Azhi in Qiandong Township, Jinhua County, raised two pigs, using a total of 739 jin of rice bran in eight months, averaging 1.5 jin of rice bran per pig per day. Piglets eat bran residue, carrots, distiller's grains, and tofu residue; when they weigh more than 50 jin, they are given as much aquatic grass, wild vegetables, and water chestnut plates as possible, with only a small amount of rice bran; when fattening pigs, they are given rice bran, distiller's grains, and bran, etc. Attention is paid to staged feeding, combining refined and coarse feeds, and less refined feed is used.

Seventh, use by-products of water mills, brewing, etc. Try to use by-products such as tofu residue, distiller's grains, sugar residue, and sauce residue to feed pigs as refined feed for pigs. There are many water mills and brewing industries in various places, and some by-products can be collected to feed pigs. However, do not use rotten by-products to feed pigs, because rotten by-products can cause gastrointestinal diseases in pigs.

Eighth, use substitutes. For example, dry and grind the corn cobs after threshing, mix them into the feed to feed pigs, which can offset part of the refined feed. Although the nutritional components of corn cobs have not been analyzed, the Andong Food Factory in Northeast China used corn cobs to brew wine, and the quality was not inferior to the wine made from grain, which shows that it contains quite a few nutrients. Therefore, various places can also use corn cobs as feed.

The above experiences and methods can be promoted and adopted by various regions in light of their specific conditions. In addition to making efforts to increase grain production and plant more feed crops based on their own possible conditions, state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives should also drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers to actively overcome difficulties, work hard to increase grain production, and plant more feed crops, to achieve the goal of developing agricultural production and solving feed difficulties, and raising pigs well.

Finally, in continuing to implement the propaganda and education of the general line and leading the development of production and mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places, in addition to patiently explaining the policy boundaries to the masses to eliminate the ideological concerns of some of the masses, the farmers should also be educated to realize that pigs are not only the main items for improving people's lives, but also important export materials. Pork can be exchanged for steel plates and machines. Raising more pigs can support the country's socialist industrialization construction. Pig manure is also a very good fertilizer.

    怎样解决当前养猪的饲料问题
    浙江省人民政府农林厅副厅长　李士豪
    编者按：目前许多地区都感到猪的饲料不足，本文提供的各种解决猪饲料的办法都很好，可供各地参考。另外，用豆饼喂猪的办法，本文没有提到。目前有不少地区的农民喜欢用豆饼作肥料，如能改变这种施肥习惯，用豆饼作饲料，多积厩肥，用厩肥上地，这样既能解决肥料问题，又能增加猪的饲料。
    目前浙江省养猪的饲料，普遍感到不足。造成这种情况的原因，最主要的是解放以来，浙江省连年获得了农业丰收，农民增加了养猪的资金，再加上人民政府大力提倡养猪，适当地提高了猪肉的价格，因而大大地刺激了群众养猪的积极性。浙江省养猪头数在一九五三年达到了三百三十二万九百零四头，比一九五二年增加了百分之一九点四。但是，饲料的生产却没有与猪的增殖相适应，因此造成猪饲料供应脱节的现象。
    另外，在增产节约的号召下，降低了机米的精度，出糠率减低，农民养猪缺少足够的粞糠，也是造成猪饲料缺乏的原因之一。
    解决当前猪饲料不足的基本办法是要增产粮食和饲料。一九五三年浙江省共生产大麦、玉米、甘薯、黄豆二十八亿一千零八十万斤，如能在这一基础上增产一成，就可以增产二亿八千一百零八万斤，如按每头猪每年平均需要精料四百斤计算，便可解决二百万头猪在四个月内所需要的精料。其次要多种多汁饲料及青饲料。如去年金华专署农场种胡萝卜五十余亩，淳安县农场利用冬闲田十八亩，种上胡萝卜等，就解决了饲料不足的困难。因此，如果能积极增产粮食和饲料作物，猪的饲料问题是可以解决的。
    现在，把增加猪饲料的经验和办法介绍如下：
    第一、抓紧培育春花草子（浙江农民把小春作物如蚕豆、豌豆、油菜、小麦等叫春花，把绿肥作物如紫云英、野豌豆等叫草子——编者）。目前春花正当生长时期，如能抓紧时间，排水追肥，可以增加单位面积产量。过去金华专区各县种植大麦，嘉兴专区各县种植蚕豆，多用来喂猪，这些作物如能增产，可以增加一部分猪的饲料。草子也是很好的饲料，不仅营养好，产量高，新鲜的可作为饲料，而且可以晒干贮存，作为干饲料。今年天气寒冷，草子生长比较迟，目前如抓紧施用肥田粉、人粪尿等速效肥料，促使草子迅速生长，则每亩增产四、五百斤是可能的。浙江省共有草子田九百八十万亩，如每亩增产五百斤，共为四十九亿斤，以五斤草子折合一斤精料计算，就可以解决二百万头猪在五个月内所需要的饲料。
    第二、利用冬闲地及胡萝卜收获后的土地，种植马铃薯。马铃薯是一种成熟期最早的作物，五、六月间即可收取。产量每亩最高可达一千斤，一般可收四、五百斤。既可食用，又可喂猪。目前正是播种时期，应争取时间，大量播种。此外，利用荒地或田边屋角，多种南瓜豆类，也可充作饲料。
    第三、收集秕谷，制成粞糠。挑选风车肚下的谷壳，扬去空壳，留下秕谷，打成粞糠，作为饲料。据临海县洋渡乡李和兴农业生产合作社检查，
  一百斤谷壳，可选出秕谷三十斤，能打成粞糠二十
  一斤。各地如能很好地收集秕谷，也是补助精料不足的一个办法。
    第四、采取甘薯藤再生割藤法。甘薯藤饲猪的办法，各地用得很普遍，如能增产甘薯藤，可以增加供应猪的饲料。临海、温岭、仙居等县的群众用甘薯藤再生办法，每一分地在两个月之内能割取八百斤。专门用来割藤的甘薯地，每半月割藤一次，割取后，即施速效追肥，半月后，又可割取。如此继续，可割几个月。饲养一头猪，只需二分地就可解决一个季节内的饲料的供应。
    　第五、利用野生植物如野草、野菜、水草等喂猪。各地区如能捞拔野菜、水草，适当配合精料，可以减少精料的用量。临海县洋渡乡利用野菜、水草的具体时间安排如下：一月到二月，甘薯藤、甘薯渣；三月到四月，草子、水漂、田荠；五月到六月，草子、水芹菜、雅条菜、红漂；七月到九月，腌渍草子、芋头秆、萝卜菜类、蜈蚣漂；十月到十二月，甘薯干、芋头秆、萝卜菜、各种野草、蜈蚣漂。
    第六、改善饲养管理方法，注意配合精粗料，分期适当配料，可以节省精料。如淳安县农场饲养员余越琴做到分期饲养，合理配料，节省了精料百分之三十二到百分之四十七。金华县乾东乡蔡阿芝养猪二头，八个月内共用粞糠七百三十九斤，平均每头每日用粞糠一斤半。小猪吃糠糟、胡萝卜、酒糟、豆腐渣等；到五十斤以上尽量给吃水草、野菜、菱角盘等，仅给小量粞糠；等养肥猪时再给吃粞糠、酒糟、麸皮等。注意分期饲养，精粗料配合，精料用得比较少。
    第七、利用水作、酿造等副产品。尽量利用豆腐渣、酒糟、糖渣、酱渣等副产品饲猪，作为猪的精料。各地水作业、酿造业很多，可以收集一些副产品饲猪。但不能用已经腐烂的副产品喂猪，因为腐烂了的副产品，猪吃下去要害肠胃病。
    第八、利用代用品。如将脱粒后的玉米心子晒干磨碎，掺和到饲料中喂猪，可抵一部分精饲料。玉米心子的营养分虽然没有分析过，但东北安东食品厂曾将玉米心子用来酿酒，质量并不次于用粮食做的酒，这就说明其中所含的营养分并不少。因此，各地也可以用玉米心子作饲料。
    以上的一些经验和办法，各地都可以根据本地区的具体情况，因地制宜地来推广采用。国营农场、农业生产合作社除应该首先根据本身的可能条件，努力增产粮食，多种饲料作物外，并应带动互助组和单干农民来积极克服困难，努力增产粮食，多种饲料作物，达到既发展农业生产，又解决饲料困难，把猪养好的目的。
    最后，各地在继续贯彻总路线的宣传教育，领导开展生产和互助合作运动中，除应耐心地把政策界限向群众讲清楚，消除部分群众的思想顾虑外，并应教育农民认识到猪不仅是改善人民生活的主要物品，而且是重要的外销物资，猪肉可以换钢板和机器，多养猪可以支援国家的社会主义工业化建设；猪的粪便也是一种很好的肥料。
