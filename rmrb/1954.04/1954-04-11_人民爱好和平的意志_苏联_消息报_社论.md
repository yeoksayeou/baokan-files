The determination of the people to further ease international tensions and consolidate world peace is growing stronger day by day. This indomitable will of the people is vividly reflected in the resolutions adopted by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council at its Vienna meeting from March 28th to 30th. These resolutions are: the resolution of the Standing Committee; the letter to the peoples of Europe; and the declaration on atomic weapons.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council was convened under the realistic conditions of easing international tensions. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the convening of the four foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin in January this year are undoubtedly victories for the people of all countries in their struggle for peace and against aggression and the forces of war.

The Berlin Conference convincingly demonstrated that contentious issues can be resolved peacefully through consultation to find mutually acceptable solutions. The issue of arms reduction was also re-discussed at the Berlin Conference. An agreement was reached to convene a conference in Geneva on April 26, with the participation of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, to study the two most acute issues in Asia—the Korean issue and the Indochina issue.

The resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out that the Geneva Conference could and must be an important step towards easing international tensions and reducing armaments. The appeal from Vienna by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to further ease tensions in Europe and Asia is very timely, because in recent months, the advocates of the "strength" policy have been increasingly using atomic and hydrogen weapons to intimidate. They openly threaten to use these weapons against peace-loving people. In Europe, aggressive blocs are committed to piecing together the so-called "European Defense Community," which will remove the restraints on German militarism and is the main obstacle to a peaceful solution of European problems. World public opinion clearly sees today that this militaristic approach will revive the former hotbed of aggression in Central Europe; establish exclusive military blocs of certain countries in opposition to other European countries; and rekindle the new flames of war. Aggressive blocs have intensified their interference in the war in Indochina, attempting to expand the war against the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Imperialist countries are exerting pressure on Latin America, the Middle East, and Near East countries in an attempt to intimidate the people of these countries. The militarization of Japan, the establishment of American military bases in Spain, and the coercion of Pakistan to conclude military agreements that endanger its national sovereignty and the security of India—all of this proves an attempt to confront the people with a fait accompli of renewed tensions in international relations.

However, as emphasized in the resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, public opinion will not allow the results of the efforts of all countries to strive for peace to be threatened by such actions. The calculations of the aggressive blocs have been disrupted: the threat of using atomic and hydrogen bombs has not frightened or passive the peace-loving people, but has instead aroused their growing dissatisfaction and strengthened their determination to fight for the prohibition of these weapons. About 500 million people worldwide have signed the Stockholm Appeal calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons. Now the people of the whole world support this demand. On this point, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has once again mentioned that declaring atomic warfare illegal is not only necessary but also possible. The people of all countries must immediately demand that their governments conclude agreements to prohibit all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, and should advocate the establishment of an international system of investigation and supervision.

A shared sense of responsibility for safeguarding peace makes the people of Europe more united. They have personally experienced the devastating consequences of the two world wars. They are increasingly firmly opposed to the path of dividing Europe into several mutually hostile military blocs, and they understand that this path contains fatal threats for them. As the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council emphasized: the people of Europe can take another path, which is to establish a collective security for European countries, based on respect for national independence, in accordance with the wishes of the people of all European countries, and based on the spirit of universal disarmament, not controlled by any one country. The European collective security system proposed by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference can ensure the success of this path. Despite the various obstacles created by the enemies of international cooperation, the idea of establishing a consolidated European collective security system is penetrating into the hearts of millions of people. The Soviet Union's proposal to ensure peace in Europe has received active support from the governments of many countries and widespread support from world public opinion. They understand that although European countries have different social systems, they have a common interest in safeguarding peace in Europe. All sincere peace advocates warmly welcome the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States on March 31, because they see in this note yet another convincing proof of the Soviet Union's sincerity in striving for peace and its determination to overcome obstacles to ensuring European collective security. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out that today, the responsibility of every man and woman in Europe is clear: to smash the "European Defense Community," eliminate war, and guarantee peace in Europe.

The action program of the forces of peace in easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Asia is also very clear. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council said that public opinion can have a decisive impact on the Geneva Conference. The first five-power conference with the participation of other relevant countries can reach an agreement on the issue of universal security in the Far East. This security can be guaranteed as long as relations between all Asian countries are normalized, the independence of all countries is recognized, and security is guaranteed.

Korea should be unified peacefully, and Korea should be able to freely decide its own destiny after the withdrawal of foreign troops. An immediate ceasefire must be achieved in Indochina so that negotiations can begin between France and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—this is the demand of the peace-loving people of the world.

The resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council reflect the true will of all people who cherish peace and the security of all countries. It is precisely for this reason that the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council have received the support of all countries. The specific program drafted in Vienna for the struggle to further ease international tensions is in the interests of the people around the world, in the interests of all nations, and in the interests of people with various political views and engaged in various professions. The Soviet people, together with all peace-loving people, warmly support the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The Soviet government, expressing the will of the Soviet people, is making every effort to promote the easing of international tensions, ensure European collective security, consolidate peace in Asia, and develop fruitful economic and cultural cooperation between countries. The Soviet Union was, and still is, a strong fortress for the people of all countries against war and for world peace.

### 人民爱好和平的意志——苏联“消息报”社论

    人民爱好和平的意志
    ——苏联“消息报”社论
    人民争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平的决心在一天天加强。人民的这种不屈不挠的意志，在世界和平理事会常务委员会三月二十八日—三十日维也纳会议所通过的决议中，有了新的鲜明的反映，这些决议就是：常务委员会的决议；致欧洲各国人民书；关于原子武器的宣言。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会是在国际紧张局势已有了缓和的现实条件下召开的。朝鲜停战协定的签订和今年一月苏、美、英、法四国外长柏林会议的召开，无疑都是各国人民在争取和平和反对侵略与战争势力的斗争中的胜利。
    柏林会议令人信服地表明：各项争执问题都是可以用协商的方式找到大家都可接受的和平解决的办法。裁减军备的问题也在柏林会议上重新进行了讨论。会议达成了下列协议：四月二十六日召开有苏联、美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国及其他有关国家参加的日内瓦会议，以研究亚洲形势的两个最尖锐的问题——朝鲜问题与印度支那问题。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议中指出：日内瓦会议可能是也必须是走向缓和国际紧张局势和裁减军备的一个重要步骤。世界和平理事会常务委员会从维也纳所发出的争取进一步缓和欧洲和亚洲的紧张局势的号召，是很适合时宜的，因为近几个月来，“实力”政策的鼓吹者们越来越频繁地以原子武器和氢武器进行恫吓。他们公开威胁要用这些武器来反对爱好和平的人民。在欧洲，侵略集团致力于拼凑所谓“欧洲防务集团”，这个集团将解除对德国军国主义的约束，并且是和平解决欧洲问题的主要障碍。世界舆论今天明显地看出：这种军国主义的方针将使欧洲中部以前的侵略温床复活；建立某些国家的排他军事集团，以与另外一些欧洲国家对立；并使战争的新火焰重新燃烧起来。侵略集团变本加厉地干涉在印度支那的战争，企图扩大反对越南、寮国和高棉人民的战争。帝国主义国家对拉丁美洲、中、近东各国施加压力，以图恐吓这些国家的人民。使日本军国主义化、在西班牙建立美国的军事基地、强迫巴基斯坦缔结危害该国民族主权和印度的安全的军事协定，——这一切都证明了一个企图：要使人民面对国际关系又趋尖锐化的既成事实。
    然而，正如世界和平理事会常务委员会决议中所强调的，舆论是不会让各国人民努力争取和平的结果受到这一类行动的威胁的。侵略集团的算盘打乱了：使用原子武器和氢弹的威胁，并没有使爱好和平的人们害怕和消极，反而引起他们日益增长的不满，加强他们为禁止这些武器而斗争的决心。全世界约有五亿人曾在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。现在全世界的人民都赞成这个要求。关于这点，世界和平理事会常务委员会已再一次提到：宣布原子战争为非法，不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。各国人民必须立刻要求他们的政府缔结协定，禁止各种大规模毁灭性的武器，应当力主建立国际调查和监督的制度。
    对保卫和平的共同的责任感使欧洲人民越加团结。他们亲身体验到两次世界大战的毁灭性的后果。他们越来越坚持地反对分裂欧洲为几个相互仇视的军事集团这一条道路，他们懂得，这条道路对他们蕴藏着致命的威胁。正如世界和平理事会常务委员会所着重指出的：欧洲人民可以走另一条道路，这就是根据尊重民族独立的精神，符合欧洲各国人民自己的愿望，并根据普遍裁减军备的精神，建立不受任何一个国家控制的欧洲各国集体安全的道路。苏联在柏林四外长会议上建议的欧洲集体安全体系可以确保这条道路的成功。尽管国际合作的敌人制造种种的障碍，建立巩固的欧洲集体安全体系的主张正在深入到成百万人民的内心。苏联确保欧洲和平的建议已经获得许多国家政府的积极支持，也获得世界舆论的广泛支持。他们懂得，欧洲各国尽管社会制度不同，但在保卫欧洲和平方面它们有着共同的利益。所有真诚的和平拥护者都热烈地欢迎苏联政府三月三十一日致法、英、美三国政府的照会，因为他们看到这个照会又一次令人信服地证明了苏联争取和平的诚意，证明了它克服保障欧洲集体安全的障碍的决心。世界和平理事会常务委员会指出，今天，欧洲每一个男人和女人的责任是明确的：粉碎“欧洲防务集团”，消灭战争，保证欧洲和平。
    和平力量在缓和国际紧张局势和巩固亚洲和平方面的行动纲领也是很明确的。世界和平理事会常务委员会说，舆论可以对日内瓦会议发生决定性的影响。在有其他有关国家参加下的第一次五大国会议，是可以就远东的普遍安全问题获致协议的。只要所有亚洲各国关系正常化，这种安全是可能得到保证的，各国的独立应当得到承认，安全应当得到保证。
    应当以和平方法使朝鲜获得统一，朝鲜应当在外国军队撤退之后有可能自由决定自己的命运。在印度支那必须立即停火，使法国和越南民主共和国之间能开始进行谈判——这是世界爱好和平的人民的要求。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议反映了所有珍视和平与各国安全的人民的真正意志。正因为如此，世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议才受到各国的支持。在维也纳草拟的为进一步缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的具体纲领符合世界各地人民的利益，符合所有民族的利益，符合抱着各种政治观点和从事各种职业的人们的利益。苏联人民和所有爱好和平的人民一起热烈拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会的决议。苏联政府表示苏联人民的意志，正在竭力促进缓和国际紧张局势、保障欧洲集体安全、巩固亚洲和平以及发展各国之间有成果的经济和文化合作。苏联以前是，现在仍旧是各国人民反对战争和争取世界和平的坚强堡垒。
