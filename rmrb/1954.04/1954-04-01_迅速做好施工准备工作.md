Last year's experience tells us that in basic construction, the work of construction preparation is an arduous and complex organizational task. Poor preparation work is often an important reason for chaos at construction sites, work stoppages, wasted man-hours, materials being moved around unnecessarily, large amounts of wasted funds, and disruption of balanced construction. Therefore, further improving the preparation work for basic construction projects, especially key projects, is of great significance for completing the 1954 basic construction tasks.

The planning and design work for basic construction in 1954 started earlier and the quality has also improved compared to last year. Most construction units of various ministries and provinces/cities have also learned from last year's experience and paid attention to the preparation work as early as the end of 1953. Some units also inspected the preparation work for key projects in January and February. Generally speaking, the preparation work in 1954 has begun to improve compared to 1953. At present, most construction units have preliminary designs and technical designs for their main projects, and some even have a portion of construction drawings. Construction organization designs have also been carried out, and some major projects can start half a month to a month earlier than last year, creating conditions for balanced organization of construction. The main building materials (cement, timber, ordinary construction steel, etc.) and general locally supplied building materials (bricks, tiles, sand, stone) of many units can meet the needs of the first phase of construction. Some units have paid attention to the inspection of material quality, strengthening the chemical analysis and physical testing of materials. Several major pieces of equipment have also found manufacturing units. Most construction units and construction management departments have rectified their organizations, streamlined their institutions, and improved the ideological and political awareness of technical personnel, staff, and fixed workers through winter training. They have purified the construction teams and, based on the 1954 tasks, have prioritized projects while ensuring key projects, and have initially balanced construction forces. These are all improvements compared to 1953.

Can we say that the preparation work for basic construction in 1954 has been done very well and that we can relax our preparation work? Of course not. According to inspections by some units, the preparation work of several units is still very poor. Even in units where the work has been done well, there are still many problems in the preparation work that urgently need to be further resolved. Some cadres in construction units and construction companies have a blind sense of complacency. They believe that the construction area this year is smaller than last year, there is experience in civil engineering construction, professional companies are responsible for installation, Soviet experts provide technical guidance, preparation work started early this year, and there are no material problems. Or, they think they are "key" units, and if the preparation is a little lacking, various departments will strongly support them. Or, they believe that the construction projects they are involved in are continuing from winter construction and that there is no need for preparation work. Therefore, they adopt a relaxed or wait-and-see passive attitude towards preparation work. This kind of thinking is obviously harmful.

There are many problems that urgently need to be solved in the preparation work for 1954. For example, the designs of some units have been delayed. Although some designs can be produced in time, there are many omissions or inconsistencies in many places. Some foreign design drawings lack translation capacity, or the drawings arrive late due to late submission of materials. These all affect the start of the construction organization design, or delay the time. If there is a lack of sufficient estimation and proper arrangements for these situations, it will affect the progress of construction. For example, in terms of material preparation, some units have not received enough steel and cement, especially small quantities of diverse materials and special materials, which have not received enough attention from construction units, and have not even been thoroughly checked. They are unclear about the situation and no one is in charge. Even for materials that can be obtained, the quality and specifications of many do not meet the requirements. At the same time, due to the uneven progress of the project plan, there are major problems with the quarterly balance of materials. The materials needed in the second and third quarters are large, but production cannot fully supply them. These problems should also be further specifically resolved. For example, in terms of equipment, many foreign drawings for equipment have not arrived or have not been designed, so the specifications and models are unknown and orders cannot be placed. The delivery dates of some foreign equipment are not in line with the construction plan. In particular, many units have not fully figured out the number and specifications of the equipment they need, how much has arrived, how much is missing, which needs to be repaired, and which needs to be replenished with accessories. As for the coordination of basic construction with urban planning, there are also many problems. Some construction units cannot determine the address because the urban plan has not been finalized. Some units have not yet carried out surveying, demolition, immigration, and relocation of graves. The engineering construction of some units conflicts with urban planning, affecting the progress of preparation work.

Therefore, there should be no blind complacency about the preparation work for this year's basic construction. We must specifically recognize the arduousness and complexity of this year's basic construction tasks, and recognize that this year's basic construction of factory buildings, installation of mechanical equipment, industrial pipelines, and other workloads and construction scale are much larger and more complex than last year, with high technical quality requirements. Moreover, several types of projects often need to be carried out simultaneously on the same construction site. If there is no overall consideration and research on equipment and materials, construction organization, and construction procedures, or if they are not properly resolved, it will cause confusion in the construction process. At the same time, in order to overcome the phenomenon of wasting state funds and to improve the management level of construction enterprises, construction and installation costs must be vigorously reduced this year. This task is very arduous. Therefore, the sentiment of overestimating the work achievements and accumulated experience of 1953, as well as overestimating the current preparation work, is incorrect and harmful, and must be overcome. We must conscientiously study the problems in the preparation work and actively and specifically resolve them.

In order to better complete the basic construction tasks of 1954, the leading organs of various ministries and regions, as well as all construction units and construction companies, should quickly carry out the following specific tasks:

First, do a good job of technical preparation before construction. First of all, we should thoroughly understand the design situation and concentrate the main design force on key project designs, in order to strive for early commencement. For minor projects such as sewers, pipelines, roads, and ancillary facilities, standard designs should be used as much as possible, or appropriate measures should be taken in the design process to shorten the design time. In order to avoid hasty phenomena in the design due to rushing for time, special attention should be paid to strengthening the liaison, cooperation, and collaboration between relevant departments in the design work, strengthening the intermediate review of the design, and organizing construction technicians to participate in the review. This can avoid or reduce errors and enable construction technicians to familiarize themselves with the design, making it easier to guide construction. For projects with foreign designs, the translation capacity of drawings should be strengthened, and technicians and technical personnel should be organized to study and familiarize themselves with their technical requirements, quality, and operating methods, and to study and formulate organizational measures and technical measures to ensure quality.

Second, do a good job of construction organization design, which is one of the main links in the construction preparation work. All construction units should make construction organization designs as much as possible. Some units whose technical designs are later should also make a more detailed general construction plan based on the preliminary design, in order to facilitate the construction site layout. When conditions permit, a more complete construction organization design should be added. The preparation of the construction organization design should facilitate the realization of balanced construction and the use of advanced operating methods and parallel flow construction methods, in order to accelerate the project progress and reduce costs in all aspects. After the construction organization design is completed, the construction unit must quickly organize employees to study it separately, put forward revision opinions, and study and formulate measures to ensure implementation.

Third, organize forces to understand the needs of materials and equipment, and assign special personnel to be responsible for solving them. For some materials that cannot be solved, design departments should be immediately studied to find other materials to replace them. Individual units that must design and construct at the same time for special reasons should contact the design department and, as far as possible, put forward the quantity and specifications of the main materials first, and use existing inventory materials as much as possible in the design to reduce backlog. After receiving building materials, all construction units should quickly organize chemical analysis and physical testing. For materials that do not meet the project requirements, adjustments should be made quickly, so as not to affect the project progress due to substandard materials.

Fourth, establish a regional management system and strengthen the administrative responsibility system at the grassroots level, and carefully select and train commanders of grassroots construction units. In particular, those units whose construction organizations have not been rectified during winter training should pay more attention to doing a good job in this area before formally starting construction.

Fifth, local party committees and government agencies should strengthen their leadership over basic construction projects, thoroughly inspect the preparation situation, and organize and urge the relevant forces to help construction units solve problems such as manpower, materials, transportation, urban planning, land purchase, immigration, and relocation of graves. The relevant central departments should pay special attention to the coordination and collaboration of the new factory's surveying, equipment manufacturing, power supply, dedicated lines, and other related aspects. In short, we must actively do a good job of construction preparation and lay the foundation for ensuring the completion of the 1954 construction tasks.

    迅速做好施工准备工作
    去年的经验告诉我们，在基本建设中，施工准备工作是一项艰巨的复杂的组织工作。施工准备工作作得不好，常常是造成施工现场混乱，停工、窝工，材料搬来搬去，大量浪费资金和破坏均衡施工的重要原因。因此，进一步改进基本建设工程特别是重点工程的施工准备工作，对完成一九五四年基本建设任务，有着重要的意义。
    一九五四年基本建设的计划工作和设计工作，时间比去年提前，质量也有改进；各部和各省市的多数建设单位，也吸取了去年的经验，在一九五三年底即注意了施工准备工作，某些单位并在一、二月份对重点工程的施工准备工作进行了检查，一般地说，一九五四年的施工准备工作比一九五三年已开始有所改进。目前，大部分建设单位的主要工程已有了初步设计和技术设计，有的已有了一部分施工图，并进行了施工组织设计，某些主要工程已能比去年提早半个月到一个月开工，同时，为均衡地组织施工创造了条件；许多单位的主要建筑材料（水泥、木材、普通建筑钢材等）和一般地方供应的建筑材料（砖、瓦、砂、石）已能满足第一期开工的需要，有的单位已重视了材料质量的检验工作，加强了对材料的化学分析和物理试验工作，若干主要设备也已找到承制单位；大多数施工单位和施工管理部门，通过冬训整顿了组织，精简了机构，提高了技术人员、职员和固定工人的思想政治觉悟，纯洁了建筑队伍，并根据一九五四年的任务，在保证重点工程原则下，进行了工程排队，初步平衡了施工力量。这些，都是比一九五三年进步的地方。
    是不是可以说，一九五四年基本建设施工准备工作已经作得很好，可以放松准备工作了呢？当然不是的。根据某些单位的检查来看，至今也还有若干单位的准备工作做得很差；即使工作做得较好的单位，在施工准备工作中，也还存在着很多急待进一步予以解决的问题。有些建设单位和施工单位的干部，存在着一种盲目的自满情绪。他们认为今年的建筑面积比去年少，土木建筑工程已有经验，安装有专业公司负责，技术上有苏联专家指导，今年准备工作早，材料没问题；或者认为自己是“重点”单位，准备差一点各部门也会大力支援；或者认为自己所在的建筑工程，是接着冬季施工继续进行的，不必要作施工准备工作。于是，他们采取放松或等待的消极态度来对待施工准备工作，这种思想，显然是有害的。
    一九五四年施工准备工作急需解决的问题很多。例如有些单位的设计推迟了；有些设计虽能赶出，但不少地方有漏项或不相衔接；有些国外设计图纸的翻译力量不够，或由于资料交得较晚，图纸到达时间推迟。这些都影响到施工组织设计不能开始或要推迟时间，如果对这些情况缺乏足够的估计和妥善的安排，就会影响施工的进行。又如在材料准备上，某些单位所需要的钢材、水泥还没有得到足够供应，特别是品种多、数量少的零星材料和特殊材料，还没有引起建设单位的足够重视，甚至还没有进行详细的清查，表现心中无数，更无专人负责；即已可以取得的材料，质量与规格还有很多与要求不相符合的，同时，由于工程进度计划不均衡，材料的季度平衡还有很大问题，第二季、三季需要的材料多，但生产不能充分供应。这些问题，也应该进一步具体加以解决。再如在设备方面，很多设备的国外图纸未到或没有设计出来，不知道规格型号，不能进行订货；某些国外设备的交货日期和建设计划进度配合不起来；特别是不少单位对自己需要的设备数量、规格已到多少，缺多少，那些需要检修，那些需要补充配件等情况，还没有充分摸清。至于基本建设与城市规划的配合，问题也不少。有的建设单位由于城市规划未定还没法确定地址；有的单位勘测、拆除、移民、迁坟等工作还未进行；有些单位的工程建设和城市规划发生矛盾，影响着准备工作的进行。
    因此，对于今年基本建设的准备工作不能有任何盲目自满的情绪。我们必须具体认识今年基本建设任务的艰巨性与复杂性，认识到今年基本建设的厂房建设、机械设备安装、工业管道等工作量和建设规模都要比去年大得多，复杂得多，技术质量要求很高，而且往往有几种工程要在同一工地上同时进行施工，如果对设备材料、施工组织、施工程序没有通盘考虑和通盘研究，或不妥善加以解决，就会造成施工过程中的混乱现象。同时，为了克服浪费国家资金的现象，为了提高建筑企业的管理水平，今年必须大力降低建筑安装造价。这个任务是很艰巨的。因此，那种过高估计一九五三年工作成绩和已取得的经验，以及过高估计目前准备工作的情绪是不对的，是有害的，必须加以克服，并切实研究准备工作中的问题，积极地具体地给以解决。
    为了更好地完成一九五四年的基本建设任务，各部各地领导机关和所有建设单位以及施工单位，应该迅速作好以下几项具体工作：
    第一，做好施工前的技术准备。首先应深入摸清设计情况，并把主要设计力量集中在重点工程设计上，以便争取提早开工；对次要工程如上下水道、管路、道路、附属设施等；应尽可能采用标准设计，或在设计程序上采取适当措施，缩短设计时间。为了避免设计因赶时间而发生草率的现象，应特别注意加强设计工作中有关部门间的联系、配合和协作，加强设计的中间审核及组织施工技术人员参加审核，这样既可避免或减少错误，又可使施工技术人员熟悉设计，便于指导施工。对国外设计的项目，应加强图纸的翻译力量，并组织技术工人和技术人员学习、熟悉其技术要求、质量及操作方法，研究并制定保证质量的组织措施和技术措施。
    第二，作好施工组织设计，这是施工准备工作的主要环节之一。一切施工单位都应尽可能地作出施工组织设计，某些单位技术设计较晚，亦应先根据初步设计作出一个较详细的施工总平面图，以便于施工现场布置，待有条件时，再补编较完整的施工组织设计；小的建设单位，最低限度亦应作出施工总平面图。编制施工组织设计，应尽量便于实现均衡施工及采用先进操作方法和平行流水作业的施工方法，以便从各方面加速工程进度和降低造价。施工组织设计完成以后，必须迅速由施工单位组织职工分头进行学习，提出修正意见，研究并制定保证执行的措施。
    第三，组织力量，摸清材料和设备的需要情况，指定专人负责解决。某些不能解决的材料，应立即和设计部门研究寻找其他材料代替。个别因特殊原因必须边设计边施工的单位，应和设计部门联系，尽可能地先把主要材料的数量、规格提出来，并在设计时，尽可能利用现有库存的材料，以减少积压。所有施工单位在收到建筑材料之后，应迅速组织化学分析和物理试验，对于不适合工程要求的材料应很快进行调整，以免因为材料不合规格而影响工程进度。
    第四，建立区域管理制和加强基层的行政责任制，认真地选拔和培养基层施工单位的指挥人员。特别那些在冬训中施工组织没有经过整顿的单位，在正式开工之前，更应注意做好这方面的工作。
    第五，各地党委和政府机关应加强对基本建设工程的领导，深入地检查施工准备情况，并组织和督促有关方面的力量，帮助建设单位解决人力、材料、运输工具、城市规划、购地、移民、迁坟等问题。中央各有关部门，应特别注意各新建厂的勘测、设备制造、电力供应、专用线等有关方面的配合协作。总之，必须积极地把施工准备工作做好，为保证一九五四年建设任务的完成打下基础。
