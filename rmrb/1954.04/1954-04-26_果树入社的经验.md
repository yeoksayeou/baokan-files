Experiences in Fruit Tree Entry into the Cooperative

　　Problems Arise When Fruit Trees Don't Join the Cooperative

　　Wangguanrentun Village in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, has many fruit trees. Out of 186 households in the village, more than 90 have fruit trees, and more than 20 rely on income from fruit trees as their main source of livelihood. In normal years, the ratio of agricultural income to fruit tree income for the whole village is 2:1. Because fruit trees account for a large proportion of income, the questions of "whether fruit trees should join the cooperative" and "how to distribute profits after joining" became special issues that had to be resolved in the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives in this village.

　　In the spring of 1952, when the Li Qing Agricultural Cooperative was first established in this village, none of the six cooperative members had fruit trees, so there were no fruit tree issues. By the time the cooperative expanded in the autumn, 11 of the 24 new members had fruit trees, totaling more than 70 trees. Yan Long relied entirely on fruit trees for a living and had no land. However, when the new members joined the cooperative, people followed the old rules from the spring when the cooperative was first established, and no one mentioned the fruit tree issue. Problems arose after the land, livestock, and farm tools were all entered into the cooperative. Members without fruit trees said, "They (referring to those with fruit trees) are only half a person in the cooperative, and it's unreliable to work with them." Members with fruit trees said, "Cooperation is good, but it's also adding trouble. We have to worry about both the cooperative (referring to the land) and the home (referring to the fruit trees), worrying about both sides." The production team leader, Wang Shirong, also began to doubt whether the cooperative could be run well. Once, he said at a cooperative affairs meeting: "This cooperative will not be good in the future. People are half-hearted, with one foot in two boats. Like Yan Long, who doesn't cultivate any land and relies entirely on fruit trees, he will definitely put aside the cooperative's work to tend to his fruit trees first when planting begins next spring. The cooperative will have to wait until he's free to expect him to work. Doesn't this agricultural cooperative become a 'labor-selling cooperative'? Isn't unified management just empty talk? Take me, for example. I have both land and fruit trees. I'm a Communist Party member and a cooperative cadre. It's wrong to neglect the cooperative when I'm busy, but I can't neglect my home either. As a result, both sides are delayed. Moreover, fruit trees grow on the land. The land has joined the cooperative, but the fruit trees haven't. This thing has nothing to do with everyone, so everyone won't cherish it. Wasting a few fruits is a small matter, but the trees may be damaged. So, even though I've joined the cooperative, my heart is still outside the cooperative."

　　Obviously, in a region with such diverse economic activities as Wangguanrentun Village, purely agricultural cooperation would not work. Therefore, at this meeting, everyone decided to include fruit trees in the cooperative as well.

　　How Fruit Trees Should Join the Cooperative

　　Everyone decided to include fruit trees in the cooperative, but how should they do it? At the meeting to study this issue, the production group leader, Ren Youqing, said: "The way land enters, fruit trees should enter the same way. Land has a fixed rent, and fruit trees should also have a fixed rent." Before he could finish speaking, Wang Shirong rejected this idea. Wang Shirong said: "Land has yield, but fruit trees don't have a fixed yield. Fruit trees have good years and bad years. Good years have a lot of fruit, and bad years have little fruit. Fruit trees also come in different ages and change every year. Old ones yield less and less each year, and young ones yield more and more each year. There's no standard for yield, so how can you set a fixed rent? There are also small trees that only require labor but don't bear fruit. How much rent should be set for them?" Wang Shirong's words made everyone understand that fruit trees and land were two different things and could not be treated the same way. Setting a fixed rent was not feasible. After research, it was finally decided to adopt the method of profit sharing based on shares. How should the profit-sharing ratio be determined? The cooperative cadres discussed it with the members. Those with fruit trees wanted an "two-eight" split (cooperative 20%, trees 80%), and those without fruit trees wanted an "equal" split (cooperative 50%, trees 50%). The cooperative cadres used a compromise method, setting it at a "four-six" split (cooperative 40%, trees 60%). As soon as this happened, those with fruit trees were up in arms. Yan Long protested the loudest, saying: "My trees yield 5,000 catties in a good year and 4,000 catties in a bad year, requiring only about 50 laborers. Even if I hired people at the highest wage rate, 1,000 catties of fruit would be enough. But if the cooperative splits it 'four-six' with me, I'll only get 2,000 catties in a good year. Cooperation is not as good as working alone." Li Pu also had fruit trees, but he didn't protest as fiercely. His trees were "dry plum" trees, requiring a lot of labor but yielding very little. A "four-six" split wasn't a loss for him. But he didn't say it openly and secretly helped Yan Long because Yan Long's protests led to higher profit sharing for fruit trees, which he could also benefit from. Seeing that the "four-six" split was not working, the cooperative cadres carelessly changed it to a "three-seven" split (cooperative 30%, trees 70%). Those without fruit trees protested again. They said: "Fruit trees are most vulnerable (fruit trees are most vulnerable to wind, frost, hail, and insects). Don't talk about years without disaster, but if we encounter a disaster year, aren't we working for nothing?" Ren Youqing, who didn't have fruit trees, used Li Pu as an example, saying: "His trees yield at most 1,000 catties in a good year and 700 catties in a bad year, and he needs 20 of our laborers. With a 'three-seven' split, we'll only get 200 catties of fruit in a bad year, averaging only ten catties per laborer. If we were to work for him for a short period, he would have to give us at least 20 catties of fruit per laborer. Aren't we clearly suffering a big loss? If we encounter a disaster year, those of us without fruit trees will be working for them for nothing."

　　The "four-six" split and the "three-seven" split didn't work, and the cooperative cadres were at a loss. The cooperative director, Li Qing, went to ask the higher authorities for a solution. The district and county leaders told him: "This issue is a new issue, and there are no good experiences anywhere. You must promote democracy, rely on everyone, and create methods based on the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit." After Li Qing returned, he sought opinions from people with fruit trees on one hand and from people without fruit trees on the other hand. Gradually, he understood a principle, which was that since the labor and yield of fruit trees were inconsistent, the profit-sharing ratio could not be forcibly unified. Therefore, rigidly stipulating "four-six" or "three-seven" would not solve the problem. After he explained this principle at the cadre meeting, everyone's hearts suddenly lit up. Wang Shirong said: "That's right, mutual assistance and cooperation must be voluntary and mutually beneficial. The 'four-six' and 'three-seven' splits didn't work because some benefited and some suffered, failing to achieve mutual benefit. To achieve mutual benefit, the profit-sharing ratio must be determined according to the actual situation of each family's fruit trees. Those with trees that require less labor and yield more should get a larger share, and those with trees that require more labor and yield less should let the cooperative get a larger share. Small trees that only require labor but don't bear fruit should not join the cooperative. Anyway, those small trees don't require much labor and won't delay the cooperative's work. If small trees insist on joining the cooperative, the tree owner should compensate the cooperative with labor." His opinion was approved by everyone. But everyone felt that there were still problems with implementing this opinion, because fruit trees change every year from growth to old age. Large trees that now yield a lot and require little labor will become trees that require more labor and yield less as they get older. Conversely, small trees that now require more labor and yield less will become large trees that require less labor and yield more as they grow. If the profit-sharing ratio is evaluated according to the actual situation of each family's fruit trees this year, what should be done when the situation changes in the future? After everyone's further research, it was finally decided that the fruit tree profit-sharing ratio would be evaluated according to the actual situation of each family's fruit trees and stipulated to be evaluated once a year. Only then was the problem solved. (Since 1954, it has been changed to once every two years because the natural growth law of fruit trees in this village is two years as a cycle, that is, one good year and one bad year. The evaluation method is to first evaluate how many fruits are produced in total in two years, and then calculate the average number each year.)

　　In March of the spring of 1953, when the fruit trees had already begun to sprout, all the cooperative members elected Li Qing and two others as evaluation representatives. Combined with the tree owners' self-reports, they went to each family's fruit trees to evaluate how many fruits could be produced and how much labor was needed in the current year. After calculating the approximate numbers of labor and yield, everyone discussed what standard to use to determine the profit-sharing ratio of each household's fruit trees. Cooperative members without fruit trees said: "Anyway, the amount we get for working on fruit trees shouldn't be less than the amount we get for working on agriculture." Cooperative members with fruit trees said: "Anyway, we shouldn't get less than we would if we worked alone outside the cooperative." Based on these two opinions, the cooperative decided to use the profit-sharing standard for agricultural workdays (calculated based on the agricultural production plan for the current year) as the profit-sharing standard for fruit tree labor. (Editor's note: It is not entirely appropriate to stipulate that the remuneration for general agricultural labor should be the standard for fruit tree labor because fruit tree labor is a relatively complex technical labor, and the value produced by fruit tree labor is greater than the value produced by general agricultural labor. Therefore, the labor remuneration should be stipulated to be slightly higher.) For example, Yan Long's fruit trees could yield 5,000 catties of fruit, requiring 52 laborers. According to the profit-sharing standard for agricultural workdays, each workday can be divided into grain equivalent to 20 catties of fruit. Therefore, the labor remuneration from fruit trees should be 52 (number of workdays) multiplied by 20 (number of fruits that should be divided per workday), which equals 1,040 catties of fruit. In addition, because the production costs of fertilizer, medicine, and machinery are uniformly paid by the cooperative after unified management of fruit trees, this cost is worth about 600 catties of fruit and should be uniformly repaid from the tree owner's fruit tree income. In this way, the labor remuneration and the repayment of costs amount to about 1,700 catties of fruit, which is the number that the cooperative should receive. The remaining 3,300 catties of fruit belong entirely to Yan Long himself. According to this calculation, the distribution ratio is 34% for the cooperative and 66% for the tree owner, Yan Long. Using the same method, it was calculated that Li Pu's fruit trees should be divided as follows: the cooperative should receive 40%, and the tree owner, Li Pu, should receive 60%. The total average distribution ratio for all the fruit trees in the cooperative was 37% for the cooperative and 63% for the tree owners. This is called the method of calculating the distribution ratio based on cost accounting. This method was unanimously agreed upon by cooperative members with and without fruit trees because those with fruit trees saw how much labor the cooperative used on the fruit trees and how many fruits they received, knowing that they were not suffering any losses. Those without fruit trees saw that they could get the same remuneration for working on fruit trees as for agricultural labor and that they were not wasting their efforts, so everyone was very satisfied. Some cooperative members without fruit trees were afraid that they would suffer losses if the profit sharing was reduced after the fruit trees suffered disasters. The cooperative, with the consent of the cooperative members with fruit trees, decided that the tree owner would bear the part of the reduced harvest due to disasters. Under normal circumstances, labor remuneration would not be reduced due to disasters, but in the case of special crop failures that affected the tree owner's life, the labor remuneration would be less, and the tree owner would repay it in the following year.

　　Many Benefits of Fruit Trees Joining the Cooperative

　　From the production process of the past year from last spring to now, it can be seen that there are many benefits to fruit tree cooperation:

　　First, fruit tree production has increased. Managing fruit trees is a relatively complex technical job. Cooperative member Yan Jinbao's fruit trees only yielded 50 catties of fruit in 1952 due to poor technology when fruit trees were managed separately. After cooperative management in 1953, the cooperative sent Ren Zhengqing, Ren Yaoqing, Zhang Zhong, Li Pu, Yan Long, and others with better technology to manage the fruit trees of each household in a unified way. As a result, Yan Jinbao's fruit trees yielded 400 catties of fruit, which is eight times the yield when managed separately. Managing fruit trees is also a flexible job. When managed separately, there was always no work to do when it was slack, and it was too busy to handle when it was busy. If one step was delayed, ten steps could not catch up. Cooperative management has overcome this difficulty, thus ensuring timely fertilization and weeding, making the fruit trees flourish with lush branches and leaves, abundant fruits, and promoting early maturity. Pests are the deadly enemy of fruit trees, occurring at least twice a year. In 1951, when the Luo insect (also known as the Yellow Tiger) occurred, Yan Long was short-handed and could not hire people at the time. He was delayed for two days, and as a result, the insects bit the fruit trees into red sticks. Although it was a good year, he only produced 1,500 catties of fruit. After cooperative management, there were more people and hands, and it was easier to use insecticidal drugs and machinery, so pests were extinguished as soon as they occurred. Last year, despite the fierce insects, Yan Long's fruit trees still yielded more than 4,570 catties of fruit (slightly less than planned), which is three times more than in 1951. Cooperative management can also solve the difficulties of insufficient production materials for each household, which also has a great impact on increasing fruit tree production. In addition, because fruits mature at different times (sun-facing ones mature early, and shade-facing ones mature late), in the past, it was not worth selling ten or eight catties of fruit that were ripe in each household, so they would not be picked, which not only affected the ripening of the fruits on the shade-facing side but also caused the loss of ripe fruits falling to the ground and rotting. After cooperative management, picking as much as is ripe avoids this loss. The above conditions have promoted the increase in fruit tree production. In 1951, each household produced a total of 5,000 catties of fruit (disaster in a good year). In 1952, each household produced a total of 8,600 catties of fruit (bad year). In 1953, after cooperation, each household's fruit trees produced a total of more than 11,000 catties of fruit (disaster in a good year), an increase of 100% over 1951 and nearly one-third over 1952.

　　Second, the potential labor force has been brought into play. In the past, farmers who mainly relied on fruit tree income were always busy regardless of day and night, and idle days were spent doing nothing. After cooperation, the agricultural cooperative used their idle labor for agricultural production. Yan Long only worked 40 labor days in the past, but last year he worked more than 100 labor days. His wife also worked more than 40 labor days. At the same time, there are many odd jobs in fruit trees. After cooperation, women and auxiliary laborers found a way to participate in production, replacing a large number of male laborers and putting them into agricultural production.

　　Third, the speculation of unscrupulous merchants has been restricted, and farmers have been spared from the exploitation of usury. The so-called "nineteen out of ten are not in hand, and disasters occur every year" means that fruit trees are prone to disasters and crop failures. Farmers who manage fruit trees have no choice but to rely on high-interest loans to survive once they encounter severe crop failures. In years without disasters, when the fruits are ripe, farmers are anxious to sell them, and unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to bargain and buy them, and farmers have no choice but to suffer losses. Fruit tree cooperation can not only overcome and reduce disasters, changing the situation of "nineteen out of ten not in hand," but also receive assistance from agriculture even if fruit trees suffer disasters and crop failures. Conversely, agricultural disasters can also be compensated by fruit trees. Moreover, fruits can be sold in a planned manner instead of being sold separately in the past, which will greatly restrict the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants.

　　Finally, because the fruit tree cooperation problem has been solved, the Li Qing Agricultural Production Cooperative has not only been consolidated but also expanded. Farmers in this village who have fruit trees but have not joined the cooperative have seen that joining the cooperative will not only not suffer losses but also be beneficial, and they all demand to join the cooperative. Last year in December, all but two of the more than 90 farmers in the village with fruit trees demanded to join the cooperative, of which 60 households have been approved to join the cooperative. This has laid the foundation for the comprehensive collectivization of Wangguanrentun Village with its diversified economy. At the same time, it has also increased the members' interest in operating fruit trees. Last year, the members cultivated 150 new fruit trees.

　　The Fruit Tree Profit-Sharing Ratio Still Needs to Be Gradually Improved

　　The method of solving the fruit tree entry problem by the Li Qing Cooperative is not bad, but the current distribution ratio for fruit tree entry is that the means of production (fruit trees) get a larger share, and labor gets a smaller share, which is obviously not reasonable enough. This unreasonable situation needs to be gradually changed in the future with the gradual increase in production.

　　In fact, the Li Qing Cooperative has already made some changes this year because agricultural production has increased more than in 1952, so the profit sharing for labor days has also increased more than in 1952. In 1952, the profit sharing for each labor day was 6,000 yuan in equivalent value. In 1953, the profit sharing for each labor day was 8,500 yuan in equivalent value. Therefore, the fruit tree labor profit sharing, which is based on the profit-sharing standard for agricultural labor days, has also increased. Last year, the fruit tree labor profit sharing was calculated at 20 catties of fruit per work point, and this year, it is calculated at 25 catties of fruit per work point. As a result, the average distribution ratio for all the fruit trees in the cooperative has changed from 37% for the cooperative to 39% for the cooperative, that is, the labor profit sharing has increased by 0.2% compared with last year. The proportion of labor profit sharing may increase to more than 40% next year. Will the cooperative members with fruit trees feel that they are suffering losses and be dissatisfied with the increase in labor profit sharing? According to Li Qing's experience, he believes that they will not because this change is gradual and changes with the increase in production. The cooperative members with fruit trees are both the owners of the fruit trees and the laborers. Their income depends not only on fruit trees but also on labor. With the gradual increase in the amount of labor profit sharing each year, although their income from fruit trees has decreased, their income from labor has greatly increased, so their total income will not only not decrease but also increase. For example, Yan Long not only received a lot of fruit last year but also received more than 1,200 catties of grain from labor, which is more than half of his income in previous years. Therefore, Yan Long was still very satisfied when the evaluation decided that the fruit tree profit-sharing ratio would be slightly reduced this year compared with last year. In this way, with the gradual increase in production each year, the fruit tree profit-sharing ratio can gradually become reasonable.

    果树入社的经验
    姚文锦　赵瑞
    果树不入社发生了问题
    山西省阳高县王官人屯村果树很多，全村一百八十六家农户中就有九十多家有果树，有二十多家以果树收入为主要生活来源。平常年景，全村农业收入和果树收入的比例是农二果一。因为果树在收入中占很大比重，所以这个村在发展农业生产合作社的工作当中，“果树入不入社”“入了社怎样分红”等就成了必须解决的特殊问题。
    一九五二年春，这个村李清农业社初建的时候，参加农业社的六户社员都没有果树，还不发生果树问题。到秋天扩大社的时候，新加入社的二十四户新社员中，有十一户有果树共七十多株，新社员阎龙全靠果树过活，没一亩土地。但在新社员入社的时候，人们还是按照春天初建社时的老规矩办事，谁也没提果树问题。等到土地、牲畜、农具都入社以后，问题就发生了。没果树的社员说：“他们（指有果树的）只算社里的半个人，跟他们合伴实在靠不住。”有果树的社员说：“合作好是好，就是添上麻烦了，又顾社（指土地）又顾家（指果树），两头操心。”生产队长王世荣对合作社能否办好也发生了怀疑，有一次，他在社务会议上说：“往后这个社可闹不好啦，人们净三心二意的，一脚踏着两只船。像阎龙一亩地没种，全靠果树，明年开春种地时，保险他会丢下社里的营生先去作务他的果树，社里指望他做活就得等他闲下来的时候。农业社这不成了‘卖工社’了吗？统一经营还不是一句空话？就说我吧，我有地也有果树，我是共产党员，又是社干部，忙的时候不顾社里不对，不顾家里不行，结果两头都得受耽搁。并且果树又长在地上，地入了社果树没入社，这东西跟大伙没相干，大伙就不会爱护。糟塌几个果子是小事，说不定树木也要受损伤哩。所以，别看我人是入社了，心还在社外哩。”
    显然，在王官人屯村这样一个多种经济的地区办社，单纯农业合作是不行的。因此，在这次会议上大家决定把果树也入到社里。
    果树怎样入社
    大家决定把果树入到社里了，但怎样入呢？在研究这个问题的会议上，生产组长任有清说：“土地怎样入，果树也怎样入。土地是死租，果树也做上死租。”没等他说完，王世荣就把这个意见顶回去了，王世荣说：“土地有产量，果树没有一定产量，果树一年大班一年小班，大班下货多，小班下货少，产量不一。果树还分老小，年年要起变化。老的一年比一年下货少，小的一年比一年下货多。产量没个标准，凭啥来做死租？还有些光用工不结果子的小树哩，你说这该作多少死租？”王世荣这一说，大家都明白了果树、土地是两回事，不能用一样的办法去处理，做死租是行不通的。经过研究，最后决定采用入股分红的办法。怎样确定分红比例呢？社干部们跟社员一商量，有果树的要“二八”分（社二树八），没果树的要“对成”分（社五树五）。社干部便用了个折中的办法，订为“四六”分配（社四树六）。这么一来，有果树的可闹翻天啦。阎龙吵的最凶，他说：“我的树大班年下五千斤，小班年下四千斤，用工不过五十来个，就说掏上特等工钱雇人吧，有一千斤果子也满够了。可是社里跟我“四六”一分，大班年就分我二千斤，合作还抵不住我单干呢。”李普也有果树，但他吵的不凶。原来他的树是“干枝梅”，用工挺多，下货挺少，“四六”分并不吃亏。但他明处不说，背后也帮阎龙的腔，因为阎龙一吵，果树分红提高了，他也能跟上沾光。社干部看到“四六”分行不通了，又马里马虎地改为“三七”分（社三树七）。没果树的又闹开啦。他们说：“果树不比闹养种（果树最经不起风、霜、雹、虫），没灾不要说，要碰上个灾年，咱们不等于白受了吗？”没果树的任有清拿李普做比方说：“他的树大班年顶多下一千，小班年顶多下七百，他得用咱二十多个工。按‘三七’一分，小班年咱们才分他二百来斤果子，一个工只平均十斤。假如给他打短卖工，一个工他总得给咱二十斤果子。咱这不是明明吃了大亏了？要碰上灾年，咱们这伙没果树的更是白白给他们劳动了。”
    “四六”分、“三七”分都不成，社干部们没主意了，社主任李清就去向上级要办法。区县领导干部对他说：“这问题是个新问题，哪里也没好经验。你们要发扬民主，依靠大家，根据自愿互利的原则创造办法。”李清回来后一面向有果树的人征求意见，一面向没果树的人征求意见。这样一来，慢慢地他就搞通了一个道理，就是：果树用工、下货既不一致，分红比例就不能强求划一，所以死板地规定“四六”、“三七”是解决不了问题的。他把这个道理在干部会议上说清楚以后，大家一下子心就亮了。王世荣说：“对啦，搞互助合作要自愿互利，‘四六’‘三七’行不通就是因为有的沾光、有的吃亏，没做到互利。要互利就得按各家果树的实际情况来定分红比例。用工少下货多的，树主就多分些，用工多下货少的，社里就多分些，光用工不下货的顶小树最好别入社，反正那些顶小树也用不了多少工，耽搁不了社里的营生。如果顶小树硬要入社，树主就应该给社补工。”他这个意见得到了大家的赞成。但根据这个意见办事大家觉得也还有问题，因为果树从生长到老死年年要起变化，现在下货多用工少的大树一年比一年老了，就变成用工多下货少的树了，反之，现在用工多下货少的小树一年比一年大了，就变成用工少而下货多的大树了。今年根据各家果树的实际情况评出分红比重来，往后情况变了又该怎么办呢？经过大家再次研究，最后确定果树分红比例按各家果树的实际情况来评定，并规定一年评一次，这才算解决了问题。（从一九五四年起又改为二年评一次。因为这村果树自然生长的规律是二年算一个周期，即一年大班、一年小班。评的办法是先评出二年内共下多少果子，然后再算出每年的平均数字。）
    一九五三年春三月，果树已经开始发芽，全体社员就推选出李清等三人为评议代表，结合树主自报，到各家果树下评议，看本年度到底能下多少果子、需工多少。用工和下货的大体数字算出来以后，大家又来讨论按什么标准来确定各户果树的分红比例的问题。没果树的社员说：“反正我们在果树上劳动分到的不比在农业上劳动分得的少就行了。”有果树的社员说：“反正我们不比在社外单干落的少就行了。”根据这两方面的意见，社里就确定以农业劳动日的分红标准（根据本年度农业生产计划算出的）为果树的劳动分红标准。（编者按：规定以一般农业劳动报酬作为果树劳动报酬的标准，是不完全妥当的。因为果树劳动是一种比较复杂的技术劳动，果树劳动生产的价值比一般农业劳动生产的价值要大，因此，劳动报酬应规定得略高一些。）比如阎龙的果树能下果子五千斤，需工五十二个。根据农业劳动日的分红标准计算，每个劳动日可分折合二十斤果子的粮食。所以劳动应从果树上分到五十二（劳动日数）乘二十（每个劳动日应分红数）等于一千零四十斤果子的报酬。此外，因为果树统一经营以后，肥料、药械等生产垫本统一由社支付，这笔垫本约值果子六百斤，应从树主的果树收入中统一偿还。这样，劳动报酬和垫本偿还两宗约合果子一千七百斤，这就是社里应分到的数字。其余三千三百斤果子全归阎龙本人。依此算出的分配比例为社里分三点四成，树主阎龙分六点六成。又用同样的办法算出李普的果树是：社里应分四成，树主李普应分六成。总计全社果树的平均分配比例为社里分三点七成，树主分六点三成。这叫做根据工本核算、计算分配比重的办法。这个办法获得了有、无果树社员的一致同意。因为有果树的看到了社里在果树上用多少工，分多少果子，知道自己毫不吃亏，没果树的看到自己在果树上劳动，能取得跟农业劳动一样的报酬，没有白花工夫，所以大家都很满意。有些没果树的社员怕果树遭灾后分红少了吃亏，社里又征得有果树社员的同意，确定：遭灾的歉收部分由树主负担，在一般情况下劳动不因遭灾而减低报酬；但因特殊歉收而影响到树主生活时，劳动报酬少些，等树主下年再补还。
    果树入社好处多
    从去春到现在一年来的生产过程中，可以看出果树合作的好处很多：
    一、果树增产了。经营果树是个比较复杂的技术活，社员阎进保在果树分散经营时因技术太差，一九五二年他的果树才下了五十斤果子。一九五三年合作经营之后，社里派较有技术的任正清、任耀清、张忠、李普、阎龙等人统一管理各家果树，结果阎进保的果树就下了四百斤果子，等于分散经营时产量的八倍。经营果树又是个松紧活，分散经营时老是松时没活干，紧时忙不过来，耽搁上一步，十步也赶不上。合作经营后克服了这个困难，因而做到施肥、锄草及时，使果树枝叶茂盛，果繁个大，还促进了早熟。虫害是果树的死敌，每年顶少发生两次。一九五一年罗虫（又叫黄老虎）发生时，阎龙因人少力单，当时又雇不出人来，耽搁了两天，结果虫子把果树咬成个红棍，那年虽是个大班年，他才下了一千五百斤果子。合作经营后人多手快，又便于使用除虫药械，所以虫害刚一发生就被扑灭下去。去年尽管虫子闹得凶，阎龙的果树还下了四千五百七十多斤果子（比原计划稍有减产），比一九五一年多产了两倍。合作经营又能解决各家生产资料不足的困难，这对果树增产也有很大作用。另外，由于果子成熟迟早不一（朝阳早熟，背阴迟熟），过去谁家熟上个十斤八斤的也不值得卖，不往下摘，结果既影响了背阴面果子的成熟，又造成熟透的果子堕地腐烂的损失。合作经营后熟多少摘多少就避免了这种损失。以上各种条件，促成了果树的增产。一九五一年各家共下果子五千来斤（大班年遭灾），一九五二年各家共下果子八千六百斤
  （小班年），一九五三年合作后各家果树共下果子达到一万一千多斤（大班年有灾），比一九五一年增产一倍，比一九五二年增产将近三分之一。
    二、发挥了劳动的潜在力量。过去以果树收入为主的农民老是忙时不分明黑，闲时白磨日头。合作后农业社就把他们的闲工用于农业生产上了。阎龙过去全年才做四十个工，去年就做了一百多个。他女人还做了四十多个。同时果树零活多，合作后又给妇女和辅助劳力找到了参加生产的出路，替换出大批男劳力投入农业生产。
    三、限制了奸商的投机活动，使农民避免了受高利贷的剥削。所谓“十九不到手，灾害年年有”，这是说果树容易遭灾歉收。经营果树的农民一旦遇到严重的歉收，就不得不依靠借高利贷过活。在没有灾害的年头，当果子熟了的时候，农民急着要卖，奸商乘机杀价收买，农民也只好吃亏。果树合作后不但可以战胜和减轻灾害，改变了“十九不到手”的情况，而且即使果树遭灾歉收也会从农业上得到援助。反过来，农业遭灾也可从果树得到弥补。而且，果子可以由过去的分散出售变为有计划的出售，就会大大限制了奸商的投机活动。
    最后，由于果树合作问题得到解决，李清农业生产合作社不仅巩固了而且也扩大了。这个村未入社而有果树的农民，看到果树入社后，不但不吃亏而且有利，都要求入社。去年十二月全村九十多家有果树的农民，除两户外全都要求入社，其中六十户已被批准入社。这就给多种经济的王官人屯村奠定了全面合作化的基础，同时也提高了社员经营果树的兴趣，去年社员们又新培植了一百五十株果树。
    果树分红比例还须逐步加以改进
    李清社解决果树入社问题的办法还不错，但是目前果树入社的分配比例是生产资料（果树）分得多，劳动分得少，这显然还不够合理。这种不合理的情况需要在今后随着生产的逐步提高而逐步加以改变。
    实际上今年李清社已有了一些改变，因为去年农业生产比一九五二年增加了，因而劳动日分红也比一九五二年增加了。一九五二年每个劳动日分红折款六千元，一九五三年每个劳动日分红折款八千五百元。所以，以农业劳动日的分红标准为标准的果树劳动分红也增加了。去年果树劳动分红是以每个工分二十斤果子计算的，今年每个工就以分二十五斤果子计算了。这样一来，今年全社果树平均分配比例也就由社分三点七改变为社分三点九，即劳动分红比去年提高了零点二。到明年劳动分红比重还可能提高到四成以上。劳动分红增加了，有果树的社员会不会感到吃亏而不满意呢？根据李清的体验，他认为不会的，因为这种改变是逐步的，是随着生产的增加而改变的。而有果树的社员一方面是果树的占有者，同时又是劳动者，他们的收入不光依靠果树，也依靠劳动。随着劳动分红数量的逐年增加，他们虽然从果树上的收入减少了，但在劳动方面的收入却大大增加了，所以他们的全部收入不但不会减少，而且会有增加。比如阎龙，他去年除了分到好多果子外，还从劳动上分到一千二百多斤粮食，比往年收入增加了半倍多，所以今年在评议决定果树分红比去年略有降低时，阎龙还是十分满意的。这样，跟着生产的逐年增加，果树分红比例就可逐步趋于合理了。
