Hebei Province's People's Supervisory Committees at all levels, in collaboration with relevant agencies, conducted comprehensive inspections of grain storage work throughout the province in late February, lasting from five to ten days, effectively promoting the grain storage work across Hebei Province.

During the final stage of grain procurement, the Hebei Provincial Supervisory Committee discovered numerous problems in grain storage work. It promptly sought approval from Party and government leading organs and, together with relevant departments such as the Grain Bureau and Finance Bureau, conducted in-depth investigations and research in key areas. At the same time, it notified its subordinate special district, city, and county supervisory committees to conduct comprehensive inspections. The inspections revealed that although no major accidents had occurred in Hebei Province's grain storage work due to the attention of Party and government leaders and the efforts of all comrades in the grain departments, there were indeed many problems. If these were not promptly and conscientiously resolved, a significant portion of the grain would be difficult to get through the rainy season. For example, the moisture content of the new grain was generally between 13% and 14% (a few reached 18% to 20%), and the grain temperature was 3 to 5 degrees Celsius (some reached 8 to 15 degrees Celsius). According to statistics from the Dingxian Special District, 74% of the district's total inventory was more or less beyond safe levels. Moreover, as the weather warmed up, all types of grain temperatures were rising. The corn stored in the Rulin Warehouse in Yutian County was inspected earlier at 0 to 3 degrees Celsius, but this time it had risen to 5 degrees Celsius. Warehouse conditions were generally poor, and most of the storage cadres were newly transferred from various departments, lacking technical skills and experience. Furthermore, due to a lack of ideological guidance, some cadres harbored negative emotions and did not work actively.

The inspections of grain storage work by supervisory committees at all levels in Hebei Province were generally carried out in cooperation with grain, finance, cooperative, public security, personnel, and industry and commerce departments. Their approach was to correct problems while inspecting, pay attention to soliciting the opinions of the inspected units, and jointly study improvement measures. They paid attention to helping the inspected units solve specific difficulties, or reported them to local leading organs or requested higher-level organs to find solutions. This made the inspected units feel that the inspection team was there to help them improve their work, and therefore sincerely provided various situations, assisting the inspection team in smoothly completing the inspection task in a short period of time. During the inspection process, many units not only exposed and criticized certain erroneous ideas at any time and put forward serious handling opinions on individual serious dereliction of duty, but also disseminated advanced experience, commended good people and deeds, and set examples at any time. Some county supervisory committees also cooperated with the Grain Bureau to convene a meeting of all grain warehouse cadres, conducted a political mobilization on "storing the people's grain well," and achieved great results. Li Jiuchen, a cadre of the Wuji County Grain Bureau, said: "In the past, I underestimated the storage work. This meeting made me realize that storing the people's grain well is a glorious task." Storekeeper Wang Zhihua said: "Treating inspection work as a regular task is the only way to avoid damaging the people's grain." Some special districts and county supervisory committees also comprehensively summarized the situation in various places and warehouses, understood the amount of grain in storage, the distribution of grain depots, moisture content, temperature, insect infestation, mold, various equipment, and cadre conditions, analyzed the main problems currently existing, and put forward improvement opinions, which were reported to the Party and government leading organs for reference, arousing everyone's attention to grain storage work and powerfully promoting grain storage work throughout the province. It also laid the foundation for further supervision and inspection of grain storage work. Now, the grain work departments in many special districts and counties in Hebei Province often actively provide the supervisory organs with information on grain storage, greatly facilitating the supervisory committee's supervision and inspection of grain work.

    河北省各级监委协同有关机关  普遍检查全省粮食保管工作
    河北省各级人民监察委员会在二月中、下旬先后在全省范围内对粮食保管工作进行了五天至十天的普遍检查，对全省粮食保管工作起了推动作用。
    河北省监委在购粮工作末期，发现粮食保管工作中存在着不少问题，随即报请党、政领导机关批准，会同粮食厅、财政厅等有关部门深入重点进行调查研究；同时通知所属各专区、市、县监委进行普遍检查。检查中发现河北省的粮食保管工作虽然由于党政领导的重视和粮食部门全体同志的努力，尚未发生大的事故，但问题确也不少，如不迅速认真解决，很大一部分粮食就很难渡过雨季。如新粮水分一般在百分之十三到十四（少数有达百分之十八至二十的），粮温三度到五度（有的到八度至十五度）。据定县专区统计，占全区库存百分之七十四的粮食或多或少地超出了安全水平。而且由于气候渐暖，各类粮温正在上升。玉田县儒林仓库所存玉米，前期检查为零度至三度，此次检查已上升到五度。仓库条件一般很差，保管干部又多是新从各部门抽调来的，无技术，缺经验，并且由于缺乏思想领导，有些干部还存有消极情绪，不积极工作。
    河北省各级监委对粮食保管工作的检查，一般都是与粮食、财政、合作社、公安、人事、工商等部门合作进行的。他们的做法是边检查、边纠正，注意征询被检查单位的意见，共同研究改进办法。对被检查单位遇到的具体困难，注意帮助解决，或反映给当地领导机关或报请更上一级机关设法解决。这样就使被检查单位感到检查组是来帮助他们改进工作的，因而诚恳地供给各种情况，协助检查组在短时期内顺利完成了检查任务。不少单位在检查过程中，除对某些错误思想随时进行揭发批判，对个别严重失职行为提出严肃的处理意见外，还随时传播先进经验，通报表扬好人好事，树立榜样。有些县监委并协同粮食局召开了全体粮食仓库干部会议，进行了“保管好人民粮食”的政治动员，收到了很大的效果。无极县粮食局干部李九臣说：“过去我对保管工作是轻视的，这次会议使我认识到保管好人民的粮食是一件光荣的任务。”保管员王志华说：“把检查工作当成经常任务，才能不损坏人民的粮食。”有些专区和县的监委还全面综合了各地、各库情况，了解了存粮数量、粮库分布地区、水分、温度、生虫、霉烂、各种设备与干部条件等情况，分析了当前存在的主要问题，提出了改进意见，报告给党政领导机关参考，引起大家对粮食保管工作的注意，有力地推动了全省粮食保管工作，也为进一步监督检查粮食保管工作打下了基础。现在河北省不少专区和县的粮食工作部门经常主动地向监察机关供给粮食保管情况，大大地便利了监委对粮食工作的监督检查。
