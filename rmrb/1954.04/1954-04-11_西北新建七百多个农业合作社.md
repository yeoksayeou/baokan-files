In the past winter and spring, Party committees at all levels in the Northwest region, in accordance with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's principle of "active leadership, steady progress," launched the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. As of the end of March, the region had established 786 new cooperatives (405 in Shaanxi, 208 in Gansu, 66 in Ningxia, 41 in Qinghai, 59 in Xinjiang, and 7 in Xi'an). Including the existing ones from last year, the total reached 1,095 (excluding over 200 cooperatives spontaneously established by the masses). It is estimated that by the summer harvest, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region will increase to over 1,200. In the agricultural areas of Northwest China, except for some counties in Xinjiang, generally each county has one or two to four or five agricultural production cooperatives. Individual counties in the new districts have as many as thirty (such as Pingluo in Ningxia and Wuwei in Gansu). The size of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives varies from place to place. In northern Shaanxi, the average is about ten households per cooperative, in Guanzhong, the average is about twenty-six households, in Ningxia and Qinghai, about fifteen households, and in southern Shaanxi and most parts of Gansu, the average is about twenty households. In Shaanxi and Gansu, there are thirteen newly established agricultural production cooperatives with fifty to over one hundred households. While establishing new cooperatives, all localities have also carried out rectification work on the old cooperatives, addressed some issues in the distribution of income, improved the internal management system of the cooperatives, and arranged winter and spring production work based on the production of last year. After rectification, the general cooperatives were more consolidated than before, and some cooperatives also expanded. The expanded old cooperatives in Shaanxi accounted for one-quarter of the original number of cooperatives. According to statistics from some cooperatives in Ningxia and Shaanxi, the number of member households increased by 30% to 40% to 60% to 70% compared with the original, and a few cooperatives expanded four or five times.

The establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in various places has promoted the development of mutual aid teams. The number of households participating in mutual aid teams has generally increased in various regions. Some mutual aid teams have expanded, some temporary mutual aid teams have been upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams have also been established in some villages without mutual aid teams. According to a survey of two townships in Nanzheng, the number of households participating in mutual aid teams increased by 18% to 58% compared with the original. Among them, Sanhuang Township, due to the establishment of three agricultural production cooperatives, led the organized farmers in the whole township to increase from 52% of the total households last year to 82%. In Ledu County, Qinghai, the number of teams increased from 190 last year to 465. In Yongning, Ningxia, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid teams increased from more than 50% of the total households last year to more than 70%. In Ningshuo, 69 temporary mutual aid teams were upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams. Dongyu Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, was originally a blank village, but 44 mutual aid teams were established this spring.

The members of the newly established and rectified cooperatives are all in high spirits and are paying close attention to production. After the Spring Festival, the cooperatives immediately seized the time to repair and assemble farm tools, prepare feed, seeds, and deliver manure for spring plowing. They have now successively been swept into the upsurge of spring plowing. However, due to the lack of production management experience in the newly established cooperatives, some cooperatives (especially large cooperatives) have poor labor organization and waste of labor occurs. This should be quickly brought to the attention of all localities, strengthen leadership, do a good job in production, produce more grain, and increase the income of cooperative members to consolidate and improve the newly established agricultural production cooperatives.

    西北新建七百多个农业合作社
    去冬今春，西北区各级党委根据中共中央“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，开展了建立农业生产合作社工作。截至三月底止，全区已办起新社七百八十六个（计陕西四百零五个，甘肃二百零八个，宁夏六十六个，青海四十一个，新疆五十九个，西安市七个），连去年原有的共达一千零九十五个（群众自办的二百多个社除外）。预计到夏收前，全区农业生产合作社可增到一千二百多个。西北农业地区，除新疆部分县外，一般每县都有农业生产合作社一、两个到四、五个，新区个别县有达到三十多个的（如宁夏平罗、甘肃武威）。新建立的农业生产合作社的规模大小，各地不同，陕北每社平均十户左右，关中平均二十六户左右，宁夏、青海十五户左右，陕南和甘肃大部地区平均二十户左右。陕西和甘肃新建的农业生产合作社五十户到一百多户的共有十三个。在建立新社的同时，各地都对旧社进行了整顿工作，处理了收益分配中的若干问题，改进了社内经营管理制度，并在总结去年生产的基础上安排了冬、春两季的生产工作。经过整顿后，一般的社较前更加巩固了，有些社也扩大了。陕西扩大的旧社占原有社数四分之一。据宁夏、陕西一部分社的统计，社员户数比原来扩大百分之三、四十到六、七十，少数社有扩大到四、五倍的。
    各地农业生产合作社的建立，带动了互助组的发展，一般地区参加互助组的户数都有增加，有些互助组扩大了，有些临时互助组提高为常年互助组，有些没有互助组的村庄也建立了互助组。据南郑两个乡调查，参加互助组的户数比原有的增加百分之十八到五十八，其中三皇乡因办起了三个农业生产合作社，带动全乡组织起来的农户，由去年占总户数百分之五十二增加到八十二；青海乐都县由去年一百九十个组增加到四百六十五个组；宁夏永宁四个乡参加互助组的农户由去年占总户数百分之五十多增加到百分之七十以上；宁朔有六十九个临时互助组提高为常年互助组；陕西省长安县东余村原来是个空白村，今春建立了四十四个互助组。
    新办和经过整理的社，社员情绪都很高涨，对生产抓得很紧。各社在春节后，即抓紧修配农具，准备饲料、籽种及送粪等备耕工作。现已先后卷入了春耕生产热潮。但由于初建起来的社，缺少生产管理经验，有些社（特别是大社）劳动组织不好，发生窝工浪费现象，应引起各地迅速注意，加强领导，做好生产，多打粮食，增加社员收入，以巩固提高新建的农业生产合作社。  （西北记者站）
