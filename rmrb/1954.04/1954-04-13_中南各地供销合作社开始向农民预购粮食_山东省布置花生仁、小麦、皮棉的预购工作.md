Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th – Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Central South region have begun or are preparing to pre-purchase grain from farmers. In Hubei Province, supply and marketing cooperatives in various areas began pre-purchasing wheat selectively in early April. Xishui and Xiaogan counties, which started pre-purchasing wheat earlier, have already concluded the pre-purchase phase in some townships. Henan Province is currently deploying the pre-purchase of wheat. The pre-purchase of early rice in all provinces of the region will begin in May. According to this year's regional grain pre-purchase plan, the state will pay farmers 500 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits. The grain pre-purchase contracts signed between local supply and marketing cooperatives and farmers stipulate that the price of pre-purchased grain will be calculated based on the reasonable price at the time of delivery by farmers, and the pre-paid deposit will not accrue interest. This year, the main targets of the state's grain pre-purchase are agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Individual farmers who have difficulties in production and life can also sign pre-purchase contracts with the cooperatives.

Currently, it is the spring plowing season. In Xishui County, Hubei Province, farmers in five agricultural production cooperatives and thirty-four mutual aid groups in the fourth district immediately ordered more than 150,000 jin of cake fertilizer, more than 2,500 jin of ammonium sulfate, and more than 360 pieces of large and small farm tools from the district supply and marketing cooperative after receiving the state pre-purchase grain deposit. In Luoyang County, Henan Province, twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives signed purchase and sales contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives in early March, stipulating that the agricultural production cooperatives would pre-sell 250,000 jin of surplus grain throughout the year, order more than 140,000 jin of fertilizer, more than 1,000 pieces of various farm tools, and 27 head of livestock. After pre-selling wheat, the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huanggang County, Hubei Province, the supply and marketing cooperative, according to the needs of the production cooperative, guaranteed to supply them with more than 5,000 jin of cottonseed cake, rapeseed cake, and chemical fertilizers in April and May to support their spring plowing and inter-tillage fertilization.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th – The Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, entrusted by the state, is about to start pre-purchasing agricultural products such as peanut kernels, wheat, and cotton lint from farmers. Shandong Province occupies an important position in China in the production of peanut kernels and wheat, and cotton production is also very high. Shandong Province is the focus of the state's pre-purchase of these agricultural products this year. The pre-paid deposits for peanut kernels and cotton lint before the sowing of peanuts and cotton will reach 347 billion yuan.

The Shandong Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee held a special meeting in early April to specifically deploy the pre-purchase work based on the situation in various regions of Shandong. The meeting emphasized that when paying pre-purchase deposits, consideration should be given to individual disaster areas and some farmers who have difficulties in production and life. At this meeting, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce and the Grain Department respectively signed contracts with the Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation and the Shandong Branch of the People's Bank of China for the pre-purchase of agricultural products and the allocation of funds. After the meeting, three work groups were dispatched to Dezhou, Changwei, and Laiyang prefectures to conduct pilot pre-purchase work for cotton, wheat, and peanuts.

    山东省布置花生仁、小麦、皮棉的预购工作
    【新华社武汉十二日电】中南区各地供销合作社已开始或正在准备向农民预购粮食。湖北省各地供销合作社在四月初就有重点地开始预购小麦。开始预购小麦较早的浠水、孝感两县的个别乡已结束预购阶段。河南省目前正在布置预购小麦。全区各省预购早稻将在五月份开始。根据今年全区预购粮食的计划，国家将付给农民预购订金五千亿元。各地供销合作社和农民订的预购粮食合同规定：预购粮食的价格按农民送交时的合理价格计算，而且预付的定金都不计利息。今年国家预购粮食的主要对象是农业生产合作社和互助组。生产上和生活上有困难的个体农民，也可以和合作社订立预购合同。
    现在正值春耕季节，湖北省浠水县四区五个农业生产合作社、三十四个互助组的农民在得到国家预购粮食的订金后，立刻就向区供销合作社订购了饼肥十五万多斤、硫酸錏两千五百多斤，大小农具三百六十多件。河南省洛阳县有二十六个农业生产合作社在三月初就和供销合作社订了购销合同，规定农业生产合作社全年预售余粮二十五万斤、订购肥料十四万多斤、各种农具一千多件、牲口二十七头。湖北省黄冈县曙光农业生产合作社在预售小麦后，供销合作社根据生产合作社的需要，保证在四、五两月供应他们棉饼、菜籽饼、化学肥料五千多斤，支援他们春耕和中耕施肥。
    【新华社济南十二日电】山东省供销合作总社接受国家委托，即将开始向农民预购花生仁、小麦、皮棉等农产品。山东省花生仁和小麦的产量在我国都占着重要地位，棉花产量也很多。山东省是今年国家预购这几种农产品的重点。在花生和棉花播种前，供销合作社预付的花生仁、皮棉的订金将达三千四百七十亿元。
    山东省人民政府财政经济委员会曾在四月上旬召开专门会议，根据山东各地区的情况具体布置了预购工作。会议强调在预付预购订金时，要照顾到个别灾区和部分生产上和生活上有困难的农民。在这次会议上，山东省人民政府商业厅和粮食厅已分别和山东省合作总社、中国人民银行山东省分行签订了预购农产品和资金调拨的合同。会后派出三个工作组到德州、昌潍、莱阳三个专区作棉花、小麦、花生预购试点工作。
