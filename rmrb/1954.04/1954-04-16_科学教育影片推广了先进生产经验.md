Science education films in our country have completed the production of twenty-three films from 1952 to 1953. Some of the completed twenty-three films have been screened in various places and have been warmly welcomed by the audience, playing a certain role in promoting advanced production experience, disseminating scientific knowledge, and so on.

After the screening of the film introducing Su Changyou's "Advanced Bricklaying Method" at construction sites in Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang and other places, the workers were greatly encouraged and continuously created new records. A construction site outside Dananmen in Taiyuan once launched a red flag competition to overfulfill the team production plan, but the percentage of overfulfillment only reached 10 percent, and there were many deviations. After the film was screened here, the workers, led by bricklayer Mo Yongfang, universally implemented Su Changyou's method of squeezing mortar with both hands to lay bricks, and production was generally overfulfilled. Mo Yongfang's team overfulfilled the production plan by 210 percent, and other teams overfulfilled by an average of 110 percent. After this film was screened at a construction site in Shijiazhuang, Zhao Shutian's team organized an experiment according to Su Changyou's bricklaying method and increased the average daily bricklaying from 2,500 bricks to more than 4,000 bricks. Comrades from the Xi'an 203 Engineering Team also knew that the advanced bricklaying method was good in the past. They also used it when building large walls and foundation projects, but they couldn't do anything when they encountered projects with complex shapes and many doors and windows. The most difficult problem they felt was how to organize labor to meet the requirements of the project. After watching the film, the workers automatically thought of allocating manpower, changing working methods, and overcoming the chaos on the site. The workers happily said, "We are also 'screening a movie'."

After the construction workers at the Seventh Construction Site of the First Engineering Department of the Second Ministry of Machine Building watched "Advanced Bricklaying Method," they held a discussion. Old worker Sun Shutang said: "Although I have learned advanced experience in the past, I have never really believed it. I always thought that as long as you work hard, that's enough, and what advanced experience is not as good as my old set of methods that I’m used to. After watching the movie, I realized that my thinking was too conservative. Su Changyou's new method is not only fast, but also of good quality, and the labor is also reasonably allocated, and apprentices are quickly trained. The movie compares the new and old bricklaying methods, and the difference is really like heaven and earth." He said that he would learn advanced experience in the future and find tricks in production to improve production tools and operating methods.

After the film "Deep Plowing Increases Production" was screened in some rural areas, it was welcomed by farmers. After this film was screened in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, many farmers learned how to use the seven-inch walking plow. In the past, many farmers in Gaobeidian in the suburbs of Beijing bought new walking plows but did not know how to use them. Therefore, some people said that the new plows were not as good as the old plows. Some people wanted to learn how to use the new plows, but there was nowhere to learn. The screening of the film made many people understand how to use the new plows and know the benefits of using the new walking plows.

"Safe Use of Electricity at Home" was also welcomed by workers after it was screened in some factories. Zhou Hongcai, the propaganda and education officer of the Qinghe Woolen Mill Trade Union, reflected: "This film has greatly promoted production safety. In the past, workers did not pay much attention to electricity in production, but now many people pay attention to it and actively publicize it to others." An electrician said: "In the past, everyone did not pay attention to the danger of electricity, which caused a lot of trouble for our work. We couldn't convince them no matter how hard we tried. After many people watched the film, they knew to pay attention to safe use of electricity. Some people saw that other people's plugs were broken and advised them to replace them with new ones." Many people who knew little about electricity no longer touched electrical appliances indiscriminately. Some people have already paid attention to not putting wet towels on electric wires and no longer tying iron wires to electric wires.

When "Eliminating Locusts" was screened in Xinjiang, locusts were seriously harming crops. Farmers had used "666" powder to poison locusts, but because the method was improper, it was not very effective. After watching the film, they improved the method of mixing the medicine, and more than 90 percent of the locusts were eliminated. After this film was screened in locust plague areas such as Shandong, Anhui, and Hebei, farmers learned many methods of locust control from the film, which played an active role in the local farmers' locust control work.

After "Safe Motherhood" was screened in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, many women realized that new methods of childbirth were better than old methods. A woman surnamed Lin in the fifth district of the county had given birth to several children, none of whom survived. In the past, she always thought that it was destined that she would not have children. After watching the film, she realized: "These were all delivered to death by the old midwives. In the future, I must use new methods of delivery." The rural midwives in Suihua County were also educated after watching this film. Some have realized that new methods of childbirth can protect the safety of mothers and children, and are actively learning new methods of childbirth. Old ladies and young mothers in Gaobeidian in the suburbs of Beijing also liked to watch this film very much. After watching it, they said: "New methods of childbirth are better than old methods of childbirth. Children don't get convulsions, and adults don't get sick."

After watching the science education films, the audience also actively and caringly pointed out the shortcomings of some films. For example, some viewers in Jiangsu believe that the film "How to Produce High-Yield Cotton" talks too much about industrial fertilizers and too little about natural fertilizers, which underestimates the current situation that industrial fertilizers in our country are still in short supply and should encourage farmers to accumulate more crude fertilizers. Some places in some films are not easy for people to understand. For example, in "Safe Motherhood," when bacteria enter the baby's body, the baby on the screen turns black, which is not easy to understand or is misunderstood. It should be stated that the bacteria enter the blood and multiply.

### 科学教育影片推广了先进生产经验

    科学教育影片推广了先进生产经验
    我国的科学教育影片从一九五二年到一九五三年，已摄制完成二十三部。已完成的二十三部影片有的已在各地放映，受到观众的热烈欢迎，对于推广先进生产经验、传播科学知识等，起了一定的作用。
    介绍苏长有的“先进砌砖法”影片在太原、石家庄等建筑工地放映后，工人们受到巨大的鼓舞，连续创造了新纪录。太原大南门外某工地曾发动过超额完成小组生产计划的红旗竞赛运动，但超额的成数仅达百分之十，而且发生过不少偏差；影片在这里放映后，工人们在瓦工莫永芳的带动下，普遍实行苏长有双手挤浆砌砖法，生产普遍超额。莫永芳小组超额完成生产计划百分之二百一十，其他各组平均超额百分之一百一十。此片在石家庄某工地放映后，赵书田小组照苏长有的砌砖法组织起来试验，就由每日平均砌砖二千五百块增到四千块以上。西安二○三工程队的同志过去也都知道先进砌砖法好，他们砌大墙和基础工程时也用过，但遇到造型复杂、门窗多的工程就没办法了。他们感到最困难的问题是如何组织劳力适应工程的要求。看了影片后，工人们自动想法调配人力，改变工作方法，克服了现场的紊乱现象。工人们高兴地说：“我们也在映电影了。”
    中央第二机械工业部第一工程处第七工地上的建筑工人看过“先进砌砖法”后，举行了一次座谈。老工人孙书堂说：“过去我虽然也学过先进经验，但我总不很相信，总以为干活有劲就行，什么先进经验不先进经验，不如我的老一套作法顺手。看了电影后，我才知道我的思想太保守。苏长有创造的新方法砌得又快，质量又好，劳动力又搭配得合理，又很快培养了徒工。电影把新旧砌砖法一比较，真是相差天地。”他表示以后要学先进经验，并在生产中找窍门，改进生产工具和操作方法。
      “深耕增产”影片在某些农村放映后，受到农民的欢迎。此片在河南新乡专区映出后，不少农民学会了使用七吋步犁。北京郊区高碑店许多农民过去买了新式步犁不会使用，因此有人说新犁不如旧犁好；有的人想学使用新犁的方法，但无处去学，影片的放映，使不少人明白了使用新犁的方法，知道用新式步犁的好处。
    “家庭安全用电”在某些工厂放映后，也受到工人们的欢迎。清河制呢厂工会宣教干事周宏才反映：“这部影片对生产安全起了很大的推动作用。过去工人们在生产中用电很不注意，现在许多人注意了，而且主动向别人宣传。”有一位电气工人说：“过去大家都不注意电的危险，给我们工作上造成很多麻烦，我们磨破了嘴也说不服他们；许多人看了影片后，知道注意安全用电了，有的人看到别人的插头坏了，劝他另换一个。”不少对电一知半解的人，不再乱摸乱动有电的器物了；有些人已经注意不再把湿毛巾搭在电线上，不再把铁丝拴到电线上了。
      “消灭飞蝗”在新疆映出时，当地正有蝗虫严重地伤害着庄稼，农民曾用“六六六”药粉毒杀蝗虫，但因用法不当，见效不大；看过影片后，他们改进了配药方法，百分之九十以上的蝗虫被消灭。此片在山东、安徽、河北等蝗灾区放映后，农民们从影片中学会了许多灭蝗方法，对当地农民灭蝗工作起了积极的推动作用。
    “母子平安”在黑龙江省绥化县放映后，许多妇女认识到新法接生比旧法接生好。该县五区有位姓林的妇女，曾经生了好几个小孩，都没有活；过去她总认为这是命里注定没有孩子，看完影片后才认识到：“这都是叫旧的产婆给接死的，今后生小孩一定用新法接生”。绥化县的农村产婆看完这部影片后，也受到了教育，有些已认识到新法接生可以保护母子平安，积极学习新法接生。北京郊区高碑店的老太太和年青的妈妈也都很喜欢看这部影片。她们看后说：“新法接生就是比旧法接生好，小孩不抽四六风，大人也不得病。”
    观众看完科学教育片后，也积极地、关心地指出了某些影片的缺点。如“怎样丰产棉花”一片，江苏有些观众认为，对工业肥料说得太多，天然肥料说得太少，这对目前我国工业肥料尚供不应求，应鼓励农民多积粗肥的情况是估计不足的。有些影片的某些地方不易让人看懂，如“母子平安”中表现细菌进入婴儿身体后，画面上的婴儿便全身发黑，使人不易理解，或理解错了；应该表明细菌是进入血液中繁殖起来的。
