Short Commentary:

    The vivid facts of transportation construction in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province over the past two years prove that restoring and opening up transportation lines is indeed a key issue in developing mountainous area production and improving the lives of the people in these areas. Party and government leading organs and all cadres in mountainous areas should enthusiastically and actively care about the construction of transportation in these areas. This is an important issue for concretely benefiting the people and eliminating their ills, closely linking the Party and the People's Government with the masses in mountainous areas, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    However, good things cannot be accomplished all at once. The current guiding principle for developing transportation in mountainous areas should combine the need to solve the current difficulties in the lives of the masses with the requirements of long-term construction in these areas. First, main transportation lines in the mountainous areas, such as highways, cart roads, mule tracks, footpaths, and waterways, should be repaired in a planned and gradual manner, so that mountainous areas and cities can be initially connected. Our country is currently concentrating its main forces on industrial construction, and it is not yet possible to invest a large amount of funds in the construction of transportation in mountainous areas. Therefore, the construction of transportation in mountainous areas should be carried out mainly by mobilizing the voluntary labor of the masses in the mountainous areas, supplemented by state funding. Moreover, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and attach importance to the use of existing conditions. The construction of transportation in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province over the past two years has not cost much money, but it has solved many problems. This experience is worth learning.

    While carrying out transportation construction, it is necessary to make full use of all possible means of transportation, such as carts, handcarts, pack animals, rafts, etc., and to help the masses in the mountainous areas to add these means of transportation in order to develop the transportation industry in the mountainous areas. It is also necessary to establish transshipment stations accordingly, and to organize transportation work to facilitate the sale of local products and the supply of production materials and consumer goods needed by the people in the mountainous areas. Only in this way can it help develop production in mountainous areas and truly achieve the goal of improving the lives of the people in these areas.

    It must be emphasized that the construction of transportation in mountainous areas is primarily for the purpose of developing production in mountainous areas in order to gradually improve the lives of the people in these areas. Therefore, when mobilizing the masses in mountainous areas to carry out transportation construction, it must not affect the normal production of the masses in these areas, especially for larger-scale projects that require more labor, it should be avoided during the busy farming season. When mobilizing the masses to build roads, attention should first be paid to practical results, and efficient organizational methods should be adopted to minimize wasted work time and maximize efficiency. Absolutely avoid pursuing grand and ostentatious forms that waste manpower. At the same time, when mobilizing the masses to build roads, coercive orders are absolutely not allowed, so as not to spoil good things.

    有计划地逐步地发展山区交通
    两年来山西省山区交通建设的生动事实，证明恢复与开辟交通线确是发展山区生产和改善山区人民生活的一个关键问题。各地山区的党政领导机关及全体干部，都应该热情地积极地关心山区的交通建设。这是具体地为人民兴利除弊，密切党和人民政府与山区人民群众的联系，巩固工农联盟的一个重要问题。
    但好事是一下办不完的。目前发展山区交通的方针，应使解决群众当前生活困难与山区长期建设的要求相结合，首先有计划地逐步地修好山区的交通干线如公路、大车路、驮骡路、人行道及河道等。使山区和城市初步连接起来。我们国家正在集中主要力量进行工业建设，目前尚不能投放大量资金去建设山区交通。因此，山区交通建设就应以发动山区群众义务劳动为主，国家出资为辅的办法进行。并且要因地制宜就地取材，重视利用原有条件。山西省两年来的山区交通建设，化钱不多，解决问题不少，这个经验是值得学习的。
    在进行交通建设的同时，要充分利用当地一切可能利用的交通工具如大车、手推车、驮畜、船筏等，并扶助山区群众添置这些交通工具，以发展山区运输业。还要相应地建立转运货站，把运输工作加以组织，以利推销土产和供应山区人民所需要的生产资料和生活资料。如此，才能有助于发展山区生产，真正达到改善山区人民生活的目的。
    必须着重指出：建设山区交通，首先是为了发展山区生产以逐步改善山区人民的生活。因之，在发动山区群众进行交通建设时，绝不能影响山区群众的正常生产，特别是规模较大需民工较多的工程，更应力求避免在农忙期间进行。在发动群众修路时，首先应注意实际效果，要采取精悍的效率高的组织方法，以便少误工多办事。绝不可追求轰轰烈烈浩浩荡荡的铺张形式，以免浪费人力。同时，在发动群众修路时，绝不允许有强迫命令的行为，以免把好事办坏。
