Sichuan Dujiangyan Neijiang Irrigation Area
Annual Maintenance Project Completed, Water Released

Following the completion of the annual maintenance project in the Dujiangyan Neijiang Irrigation Area in the West Sichuan Plain, water was released on April 1st. The water, drawn from the Min River in Guanxian County, flows through more than 2,700 large and small canals, irrigating over three million mu of fertile land in fourteen counties and cities, including Wenjiang, Pixian, and Chengdu. This year, the annual maintenance project involved over 40,000 cubic meters of earth and stonework, converting many water diversion dams of the main canals into semi-permanent structures. The Puyang River, which connects to the Guan Canal, was also widened, and the dikes and riverbed of the Baitiao River were reinforced and deepened. As a result, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 100,000 mu compared to last year.

    四川都江堰内江灌区
    岁修工程完成已开堰放水
    川西平原都江堰内江灌区的岁修工程完成后，在四月一日开堰放水。水从灌县岷江引出，经过二千七百多道大小干渠，灌溉温江、郫县、成都等十四县、市的三百多万亩良田。今年，岁修工程做了土、石工四万多市方，使主要干渠的很多湃水坝改为半永久性工程，连接官渠堰的蒲阳河也加宽了，还加固和淘深了柏条河的堤岸和河床。因此，灌区比去年扩大了十万多亩。
