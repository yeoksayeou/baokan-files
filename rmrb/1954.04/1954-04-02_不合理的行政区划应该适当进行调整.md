    Unreasonable Administrative Divisions Should Be Appropriately Adjusted

    A letter from Xiong Weiyi and more than seventy others in Guangjia Township, Tongjiang County, Sichuan Province: Guangjia Township, Tongjiang County, is the northernmost township in Sichuan Province, 480 li from Tongjiang County. It is even further from the location of the Da County Commissioner's Office, nearly 1,000 li, and the road is rugged. Therefore, it is very difficult for the Tongjiang County People's Government to lead the work in our township. County and district cadres rarely come to our township, and it is very inconvenient for our township cadres to go to the city for meetings. For example, Zhang Guoquan, the secretary of the Youth League branch in our township, once went to the city for a meeting, traveling a total of 960 li round trip, selling 12 jin of gastrodia elata and a pig to pay for travel expenses, which caused a big quarrel with his family. Zhang Deyuan, Bai Guiying, Li Fude, and others also incurred debts because of going to the city for meetings. Now many cadres are afraid of going to the city for meetings.

    Our township is only 150 li from Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, and the road is easy to travel. If Guangjia Township is placed under the leadership of Nanzheng County, it would be beneficial to the work. We have reflected this opinion to the county, and the county also agreed to place our township under the leadership of Nanzheng County. However, because this issue involves the administrative division between Sichuan Province and Shaanxi Province, as well as between the Southwest Great Administrative Region and the Northwest Great Administrative Region, it cannot be resolved quickly. We request the civil affairs departments of the above-mentioned regions to consider this issue and resolve our difficulties as soon as possible.

    Editor's Note: The request of the masses in Guangjia Township, Tongjiang County, is worthy of attention. At present, there are a small number of villages and townships that are located in remote areas, and the county and district leading organs rarely pay attention to them, so that many problems cannot be resolved in a timely manner, work is difficult to carry out, and they are gradually lagging behind. This situation should be prevented. The Administrative Department of the Central People's Government has asked the Civil Affairs Department of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government to study the administrative division issue of Guangjia Township and consult with the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government to handle it. It is hoped that the civil affairs departments of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces will consider and make reasonable adjustments based on historical conditions, geographical conditions, and the opinions of the masses. If it is not possible to adjust at present, the Tongjiang County People's Government should also strengthen its leadership over the township and solve the difficulties of the township cadres in attending meetings in the county, in order to facilitate the work.

### 不合理的行政区划应该适当进行调整

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不合理的行政区划应该适当进行调整
    四川省通江县广家乡熊维义等七十多人来信：通江县广家乡是四川省最北的一个乡，距通江县城有四百八十里路，距达县专署所在地更远，将近千里，并且路途崎岖。所以通江县人民政府领导我乡工作很困难。县区干部很少来我乡，我乡干部要进城开会也十分不便。例如我乡青年团支部书记张国全有一次进城开会，往返共走九百六十里路，卖掉十二斤天麻和一头猪作路费，家里的人因而和他大吵了一架。张德元、白桂英、李富德等也都因进城开会而欠了债。现在有很多干部都怕进城开会。
    我乡距陕西省南郑县只有一百五十里路，路也好走；如果把广家乡划归南郑县领导，对工作是有好处的。我们曾经将这个意见反映到县，县里也同意将我乡划归南郑县领导，但是因为这个问题牵涉到四川省和陕西省之间以及西南大行政区和西北大行政区之间的行政区划问题，所以不能很快得到解决。我们要求上述地区的民政部门考虑这个问题，早日解决我们的困难。编者按：通江县广家乡群众的要求，是值得重视的。目前有少数乡村，因为地处偏僻，县区领导机关很少过问，以致很多问题不能及时解决，工作难以开展，而逐渐处于落后状态。这种情况是应该注意防止的。广家乡的行政区划问题，中央人民政府内务部已请四川省人民政府民政厅研究，并与陕西省人民政府会商处理。希望四川、陕西两省民政厅根据历史情况、地理条件和群众意见来考虑加以合理调整；如果目前尚不可能调整，通江县人民政府也应加强对该乡的领导，解决该乡干部去县开会的困难，以利工作的进行。
