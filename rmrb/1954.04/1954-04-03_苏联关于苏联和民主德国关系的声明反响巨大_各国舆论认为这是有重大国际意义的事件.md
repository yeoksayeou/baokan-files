Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st dispatch from TASS: The Soviet government's declaration on establishing relations with the German Democratic Republic (GDR) like those with other sovereign states has been met with fair appraisal by newspapers and the public in various countries around the world, who believe it to be an event of great international significance.

The Soviet government's statement received a wide response in Germany.

"Neues Deutschland" wrote: "The Soviet government not only grants the German Democratic Republic the right to decide its internal and foreign affairs, but also the right to decide its relations with West Germany. This is of great significance to the German people." "Berliner Zeitung Abendausgabe" pointed out: "The Soviet Union's granting of sovereignty to the German Democratic Republic demonstrates the Soviet Union's continued efforts to restore German unity." "Berliner Zeitung Abendausgabe" compared the Soviet government's statement with the decision of the Western High Commissioners regarding the military clauses supplementing the Bonn Constitution, pointing out that this decision "did not affect the rule established by the Western countries based on enslaving occupation regulations."

Many West German newspapers have also reached the same conclusion.

For example, the bourgeois newspaper "Weser-Kurier," published in Bremen, commented that after the Soviet Union took friendly actions toward the German people, the residents of West Germany could not help but see the different positions of the German Democratic Republic and the Bonn state. The newspaper wrote: "On the one hand, there is a free German Democratic Republic, and on the other hand, there is a federal republic supervised by Western countries." The "Volksstimme," published in Stuttgart, wrote: "The German Democratic Republic has obtained all the freedoms of a sovereign state because it has fulfilled all the obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement."

The U.S. State Department was disturbed by the impact of the Soviet government's statement. U.S. High Commissioner to Germany Conant hastily issued a so-called statement that the United States hoped to give West Germany "sovereignty," which reflected this unease. The "New York Times" said: Conant's remarks illustrate that Western countries have to admit the profound impression created by the Soviet government's statement among the West German public.

Some American journalists, considering the existence of the occupation regime imposed on West Germany, had to admit that the German Democratic Republic had the right to freely resolve its own affairs. For example, "New York Times" Berlin correspondent Sulzberger wrote: The sovereignty given to the German Democratic Republic by the Soviet government's statement is more than what "Britain, France, and the United States have given to the Bonn regime."

British newspapers also acknowledged the facts mentioned above. Reuters, commenting on the Soviet government's statement, pointed out that East Germany has obtained sovereignty, while West Germany remains bound by the modified occupation regulations.

In France, some newspapers commented on the international impact of the new nature of relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. For example, "France Soir" assumed that the Soviet government's statement might "force the world to recognize the German Democratic Republic." The newspaper said that the German Democratic Republic should be able to participate in conferences discussing German issues.

The fact that the German Democratic Republic's prestige is increasing among the entire German population has greatly disturbed the ruling groups in the United States, Britain, and France. American and Bonn propagandists, in order to weaken the impact of this statement on the West German public, are distorting the substance of this document, insisting that the German Democratic Republic's attainment of sovereignty "will deepen the division of Germany."

The democratic newspapers of Western European countries and the newspapers of people's democratic countries all welcomed the Soviet government's statement on relations with the German Democratic Republic.

The Italian "Avanti!" said that the Soviet decision "is a new contribution to the solution of European problems." The French "L'Humanité," in an editorial, emphasized that the Soviet government's decision is in line with the Soviet Union's consistent and firm policy of peace and friendship with the German people.

The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" said: "From the perspective of strengthening the democratic forces in Germany, safeguarding the security of Europe, and the interests of Germany's neighbors – including the Polish people – the Soviet government's statement is an extremely important document."

The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" welcomed the Soviet government's statement, saying that it creates more favorable conditions for solving the German problem. The Romanian "Scînteia" pointed out "the great significance of the Soviet statement for the peace and security of the European people." The Hungarian "Szabad Nép" said that the Soviet government's statement marks the beginning of a new stage in the history of the German Democratic Republic.

    苏联关于苏联和民主德国关系的声明反响巨大
    各国舆论认为这是有重大国际意义的事件
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府关于与德意志民主共和国建立像与其他主权国一样的关系的声明，得到了世界各国报纸和公众的公正的评价，认为这是一件具有重大国际意义的事件。
    苏联政府声明在德国得到广泛的反应。
    “新德意志报”写道：“苏联政府不但给予了德意志民主共和国决定它的内政和外交事务的权利，而且给予了决定与西德的关系的权利。这一点对于德国人民具有非常巨大的意义。”“柏林日报晚刊”指出：“苏联给予德意志民主共和国主权，这就表明苏联在继续不断地为恢复德国统一而努力。”“柏林日报晚刊”把苏联政府的声明和西方国家高级专员关于波恩宪法补充军事条款的决定作了一个比较，指出这一决定“并没触动西方国家根据奴役性的占领法规所建立的统治。”
    西德的许多报纸也得出了同样的结论。
    例如，在不来梅出版的资产阶级报纸“威悉快报”评论道，在苏联对德国人作出了友好的行动之后，西德的居民就不能不看出德意志民主共和国和波恩国家所处的不同的地位。该报写道：“一方面是一个自由的德意志民主共和国，另一方面是一个受西方国家监督的联邦共和国。”在斯图加特出版的“人民之声报”写道：“德意志民主共和国由于履行了波茨坦协定所规定的全部义务，得到了一个主权国家的全部自由。”
    美国国务院对于苏联政府的声明所起的影响感到不安，美国驻德国高级专员康南特匆匆发表的一篇所谓美国希望给西德以“主权”的谈话便反映了这种不安。“纽约时报”说：康南特的谈话说明西方国家不得不承认苏联政府的声明在西德公众中间造成的深刻印象。
    某些美国记者们由于考虑到强加在西德身上的占领政权的存在，不得不承认德意志民主共和国是有权自由解决它自己的事务的。譬如“纽约时报”驻柏林记者苏利梵写道：苏联政府的声明所给予德意志民主共和国的主权比“英国、法国和美国给予波恩政权”的要多些。
    英国报纸也承认上面提到的事实。路透社就苏联政府声明发表评论时指出：东德已经获得了主权，而西德仍然受着修改过的占领法规的束缚。
    在法国，某些报纸评论了苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系的新的性质对国际的影响。例如，“法兰西晚报”假定说，苏联政府的声明可能“迫使世界各国承认德意志民主共和国”。该报说，德意志民主共和国应该能够参加讨论德国问题的会议。
    德意志民主共和国在整个德国居民中的威望日益提高的事实，使美国、英国和法国统治集团大为不安。美国和波恩宣传家为了想削弱这个声明对西德公众的影响，正歪曲这个文件的实质，硬说德意志民主共和国的得到主权，“将加深德国的分裂”。
    西欧各国的民主报纸以及人民民主国家的报纸，都欢迎苏联政府关于和德意志民主共和国关系的声明。
    意大利的“前进报”说，苏联的决定“对于解决欧洲问题是一个新的贡献”。法国的“人道报”在社论里着重指出：苏联政府的决定，是与苏联一贯奉行的与德国人民和平友好的坚定政策一脉相承的。
    波兰“人民论坛报”说：“从加强德国的民主力量、保障全欧的安全以及德国的邻国——包括波兰人民在内——的利益的观点来看，苏联政府的声明是一个极其重要的文件。”
    保加利亚“工人事业报”欢迎苏联政府的声明：说它为解决德国问题创造了更有利的条件。罗马尼亚“火花报”指出了“苏联的声明对欧洲人民的和平与安全的重大意义”。匈牙利的“自由人民报”说，苏联政府的声明是德意志民主共和国历史上的一个新阶段的开始。
