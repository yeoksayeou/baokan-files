The Beijing Municipal Department Stores Company and the Municipal Cooperative General Office, and other units, are vigorously preparing materials to supply the capital's working people for a happy "May Day" celebration.

The clothing departments of Beijing Municipal Department Store Company's various outlets, in addition to preparing a large number of blue uniforms for workers to wear, are now preparing a batch of gray uniforms, which will be supplied successively before "May Day." The quality of these uniforms is mostly twill, gabardine, or khaki. A large number of brightly colored floral fabrics, plaid shirts, and skirts, as well as more plain blue cloth skirts, have begun to be supplied or shipped in, so that girls can dress beautifully for the parade during the festival. The children's clothing department has prepared a large number of white shirts for middle-sized and small children, so that Young Pioneers can wear clean team uniforms and tie bright red scarves to cheer and sing to their hearts' content in Tiananmen Square. In addition, some plain striped poplin shirts are also prepared to meet customer needs. In addition to the daily supply of work shoes, sneakers, and leather shoes, the shoe department has also added a new batch of large and small White Rabbit shoes and rayon, Yonggu Ni, and corduroy women's casual shoes. In addition, a large number of men's and women's socks are being shipped in.

The Clothing Management Department of Beijing Municipal Cooperative General Office put forward the slogan to various sewing production cooperatives in early April: "Let the working people of the capital wear new clothes to welcome 'May Day.'" The division of labor method was adopted in various production cooperatives, which greatly improved production efficiency. The highest of these has increased production by 20%. At the same time, because workers paid attention to saving clothing materials in tailoring, the cost of each set of uniforms was reduced by 5,000 to 7,000 yuan. Now, the average daily outward transfer of uniforms to various district federations of cooperatives and department stores is more than 2,200 sets, more than 280 pieces of children's clothing, and 9,000 shirts. Among the floral fabric women's shirts, the Polish-style worker-peasant-soldier floral fabric shirts are the most popular. A portion of cloth made of Cloth made of "克罗丁" (Keluoding, could be translated as "Croydon Cloth") has also been added to the uniforms.

In terms of food supply, the Beijing Municipal Department Store Company is continuously shipping in a large number of canned fruits and meats from Shanghai and Tianjin. Biscuits and soft candies purchased from Shanghai are being loaded and shipped, and some of them have arrived. This year's preparation of various breads, pastries, and cakes is one to two times more than the usual supply, and some are even more. The Fruit Management Department of Beijing Municipal Cooperative General Office stored a large number of apples, oranges, and pears in ice cellars as early as March. A large number of sugar cane and water chestnuts have also been stored, and bananas and pears are currently being shipped in from various places.

In addition, the Beijing Municipal Food Company has prepared 150,000 jin of eggs, more than 400,000 jin of fresh fish and shrimp, and a batch of beef, mutton, and pork to supply during "May Day" and the two days before the festival.

    北京市国营商业部门和合作社
    大力准备物资供应人民欢度“五一”节的需要
    北京市百货、食品公司和市合作总社等单位，正大力准备物资，供应首都劳动人民欢度“五一”节。
    北京市百货公司各门市部的服装部除了准备大量蓝色制服供应工人们穿着外，最近正准备一批灰色制服，即将在“五一”节前陆续供应。这些制服的质量大部为斜纹和华达呢或卡其布。大批艳丽的花布、格布衬衣和裙子，还有较素静的蓝布裙子已开始供应或运进，让姑娘们在节日打扮得漂漂亮亮去游行。童装部准备了大批中人、小人穿的白衬衫，好让少年先锋队员们穿上洁白的队服，打了鲜红的领巾到天安门广场尽情的欢呼、歌唱，此外还准备一部分素静的条格府绸衬衣供应顾客需要。鞋子部除了日常供应的工作鞋、球鞋、皮鞋外，还新添了一批大、小白力士鞋和罗缎、永固呢、灯芯绒女便鞋。另外还有大批男女袜套正源源运进。
    北京市合作总社服装经理部在四月初旬就向各缝纫生产社提出：要让首都劳动人民穿上新衣迎接“五一”节的口号，在各生产社采用分业作业法，使生产效率大大提高，其中最高的有提高生产量百分之二十的。同时因为工人们在裁剪上注意节约衣料，使每套制服能降低成本五千至七千元。现在每天源源外调各区联社及百货公司的制服平均就有二千二百多套，童装二百八十多件，衬衣九千件，花布女式衬衣以波兰式工农兵花布衬衣最受欢迎。制服中还增加了一部分克罗丁布的。
    在食品供应上，北京市百货公司正从上海、天津陆续运进大批水果和肉类罐头，从上海购进的饼干、软糖都在装车起运，其中一批已运到。今年准备各种面包、点心和蛋糕的数量，都比平日供应量增加一至二倍，个别的增加得更多。北京市合作总社水果经理部早在三月份就在冰窖内储藏大量苹果、橘子和梨。还储存了大批甘蔗和荸荠，目前正从各地源源运来香蕉和梨。
    另外，北京市食品公司准备了十五万斤鸡蛋、四十多万斤鲜鱼鲜虾和一批牛、羊、猪肉，在“五一”节及节前两天内供应。
