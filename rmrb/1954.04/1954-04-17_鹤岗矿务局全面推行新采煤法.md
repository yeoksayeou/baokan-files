    Hegang Mining Bureau Fully Implements New Coal Mining Methods
    In order to tap the potential of existing mines and fully utilize underground resources, the Northeast Coal Mining Administration's Hegang Mining Bureau is comprehensively improving coal mining methods.
    Through years of production reform, the Hegang Mining Bureau has fundamentally eliminated the old high-incidence and residual pillar coal mining methods and has implemented mechanized production. In 1953, the proportion of mechanized coal mining faces in the bureau reached 91 percent, and the efficiency per worker increased to 3.09 tons. However, last year's recovery rate was only 54.5 percent, resulting in a loss of nearly 200,000 tons of coal. In order to change this situation, the bureau conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the National Coal Mine Conference and the recommendations of Soviet experts, and decided to comprehensively improve coal mining methods this year, promoting coal mining methods such as wooden board and metal mesh false roofs, water-sand filling, and the mining of thin coal seams above 0.6 meters. After the full implementation of these new coal mining methods, the overall recovery rate will increase to 84 percent, the average lifespan of the bureau's mines can be extended by five to six years, an increase of more than 11 million tons in extraction is expected, and good conditions can be created for safe production and full mechanization.
    At the beginning of this year, the bureau conducted ideological mobilization for improving coal mining methods and formulated a draft plan for improving coal mining methods, making specific arrangements. Pilot projects began in March, with the implementation of wooden board false roofs and metal mesh, one-time high extraction and other coal mining methods in Nanshan Education Pit and Three Pits, Xingshan First Pit, and Dongshan First Pit. The coal mining team led by national model worker Lü Wenping in the Nanshan Education Pit began implementing the wooden board false roof coal mining method on March 5th. After 13 days of trial implementation, initial success has been achieved. From the 18th, the team has been able to achieve one cycle per day and night, carrying out production rhythmically, and the recovery rate in March has increased to 78.3 percent. Currently, all employees of the bureau are working hard to fully implement the new coal mining methods.

    鹤岗矿务局全面推行新采煤法
    东北煤矿管理局鹤岗矿务局为挖掘现有矿井潜在能力，充分利用地下资源，正全面改进采煤方法。
    鹤岗矿务局经过几年来的生产改革，已根本上消灭了高发式、残柱式的旧采煤方法，推行了机械化生产。一九五三年该局机械化采煤场子的比重已达百分之九十一，每工效率提高到三点零九吨。但是去年的回采率仅达百分之五十四点五，损失煤近二十万吨。为改变这种状况，该局认真贯彻了全国煤矿会议的决议和苏联专家的建议，决定在今年全面改进采煤方法，推行木板和金属网假顶、水砂充填等采煤方法和开采零点六公尺以上的薄煤层。这些新采煤法全部实行后，全局回采率将提高到百分之八十四，全局矿井平均可延长寿命五、六年，将增加一千一百多万吨以上的采出量，并可为安全生产和全面机械化创造良好的条件。
    今年初，该局就进行改进采煤方法的思想动员，并制订了采煤方法改进草案，作出了具体措施。三月份开始试点，先后在南山教育坑和三坑、兴山一坑、东山一坑推行了木板假顶和金属网、一次采高等采煤法。南山教育坑全国劳动模范吕文平领导的采煤班，从三月五日开始实行木板假顶采煤法，经十三天的试行，已获得初步成功。该班从十八日起便做到了一昼夜一循环，有节奏地进行生产，三月份的回采率已提高到百分之七十八点三。目前全局职工正为全面推行新采煤法而努力。
