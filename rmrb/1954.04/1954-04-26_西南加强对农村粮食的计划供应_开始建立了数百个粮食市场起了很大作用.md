    (Our Chongqing dispatch of the 24th) Grain departments in Southwest China are strengthening the planned grain supply to rural areas. In the first quarter of this year, the state's grain supply to rural areas in Southwest China accounted for 30.89% of the total supply to both urban and rural areas, basically meeting the needs of the rural population and ensuring spring plowing. Various regions, in conjunction with the overall task of education, have widely publicized the grain planning policy, organized investigations, established grain supply points based on the actual grain situation in rural areas, democratically assessed and issued grain purchase certificates, and supplied grain to households in need according to fixed quotas. During spring plowing, Zizhong County in Sichuan Province reissued grain purchase certificates to farmers who had been missed in previous assessments and those currently in need of grain, appropriately expanding the supply scope. It also allocated a large amount of grain as loans to farmers lacking money and grain, and provided relief to the elderly, weak, disabled, and widowed who were short of grain. The strengthening of rural grain supply work has clarified some of the vague understanding of the state's grain policy among some of the masses, strengthened the relationship between the Party, the People's Government, and the farmers, and further enhanced the farmers' enthusiasm for production. After Liangfeng Township, Zone One, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province improved its grain supply, all sixty-one mutual aid teams in the township became active, with dozens of waterwheels irrigating the fields all day long, and sixteen ponds and dams were repaired or newly built. In Jianyang County, the trend of shrinking cotton fields has begun to reverse due to the sufficient supply of grain to cotton farmers; in Wu'ai Village, Qunli Township, cotton fields have expanded by 5.98% compared to last year. In order to further meet the grain needs of grain-deficient households in rural areas, various places in Southwest China have begun to establish a number of state-owned grain markets. Nanchong Prefecture in Sichuan Province now has 470 state-owned grain markets. In order to strengthen market management, each county has transferred cadres to strengthen the market management organizations. After the establishment of the state-owned grain markets, the amount of grain entering the market has gradually increased. In Wenming Township, Duyun County, Guizhou, only sporadic grain was available before, but since the establishment of the grain market in March, the first market session had 2,000 catties of grain, and the second session increased to 3,000 catties, which has played a significant role in regulating the surplus grain in rural areas.

    西南加强对农村粮食的计划供应
    开始建立了数百个粮食市场起了很大作用
    【本报重庆二十四日电】西南各地粮食部门加强农村粮食计划供应工作。今年第一季度国家供应西南农村的粮食，即占城乡供应总量的百分之三十点八九，基本上满足了农村需粮人口的需要，保证了春耕。各地结合总任务教育对粮食计划政策作了广泛宣传，并组织力量进行了调查，根据农村粮食的实际情况，设立粮食供应点，民主评议发给购粮证，定量供应了需粮户的粮食。春耕中，四川省又对过去由于漏评和当前需粮的农户补发了购粮证，适当扩大了供应面，并拨出大量粮食贷给无钱缺粮的农民，对缺粮的老弱残废者进行了救济。农村粮食供应工作的加强，澄清了部分群众对国家粮食政策的一些模糊认识，密切了党、人民政府和农民的关系，进一步提高了农民的生产积极性。四川省资中县一区凉风乡作好粮食供应后，全乡六十一个互助组都活跃起来，整天几十架水车车水灌田，并整修、新修塘堰十六口。简阳县由于充分供应了棉农的粮食，缩小棉田的趋势已开始扭转，群力乡五爱村棉田较去年扩大百分之五点九八。为进一步满足农村缺粮户的粮食需要，西南各地已开始建立一批国家粮食市场。四川省南充专区现已有国家粮食市场四百七十个，为加强市场管理，各县并抽调干部充实市场管理机构。国家粮食市场建立后，上市粮食逐渐增多。贵州都匀县文明乡原来只有零星粮食上市，自三月建立粮食市场后，上市粮食第一场就有二千斤，第二场增至三千斤，对农村余粮调剂起了很大作用。
