    Cheering Under the Qilian Mountains
    March 4th. The Qilian Mountains were still covered in white snow. All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed here rejoiced. They gathered from all directions, standing on both sides of the Gansu-Qinghai Highway, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their loved ones.
    This is where Gansu and Qinghai meet. The soldiers had already given a new look to an iron bridge here. Various patterns decorated both ends of the bridge, with a couplet pasted at the eastern end: "Arch erected on the Gansu-Qinghai Road, welcoming loved ones under the Qilian Mountains." From here to the barracks' location, a total of seven arches were set up, each with a large plaque reading: "Welcome the National People's Delegation to Visit the People's Liberation Army." Along many sections of the highway, nearly two hundred red and green slogans welcoming the delegation were posted. These were all carefully made by the soldiers. Before dawn today, they hung colorful balls and lanterns on the arches and re-swept the highway.
    Now, they all stood here, waiting with pleasant and eager hearts for the arrival of their loved ones.
    "They're here! They're here!" In front of the procession, thunderous applause and slogans rang out from the head of the bridge. Several dazzling decorated vehicles slowly approached the welcoming crowd.
    "Comrades, good health!" The representatives shouted after getting out of the vehicles. This was the voice of the people of the motherland, the voice of Chairman Mao! It was like an electric current, quickly passing through the bodies of the soldiers, exciting the heart of every soldier.
    "Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!"
    "Comrades, you've worked hard!"
    "Serve the people!"
    The soldiers surged towards the representatives like a tide, shaking hands tightly and embracing affectionately. Bunches of flowers were presented to the representatives, and colored paper flew into the sky like colorful petals, landing on the representatives' heads, bodies, and vehicles.
    As the leaders of the troops accompanied the representatives through the welcoming ranks, slogans, applause, gongs, drums, and firecrackers rose and fell, shaking the snow-covered valleys and drowning out the sound of the rushing torrents under the bridge. The soldiers raised flowers and shouted loudly: "Thank you to the people of the whole country and Chairman Mao for your kind care and sincere greetings!" "Strengthen learning, and strive to build a strong national defense army to defend the socialist construction of the motherland..."
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Pu Jinglin, Zhu Fangtai)
　　"Protect You, Dear Mother!"
    On February 19th, the delegation arrived at the Political Department of the Henan Military Region. An old woman in the delegation was warmly welcomed by everyone. The name of this old woman was Wang Xiuluan, a model of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and also a model worker. Her eldest son died in the battle to liberate the Southwest, and then she sent her second son to the army. Therefore, the soldiers affectionately called her "Mother of the People's Soldiers."
    That day, as soon as she finished speaking, Jiang Taizhen quickly ran back to the dormitory, took out his citation for merit, and respectfully presented it to Old Woman Wang, saying excitedly: "I have neither a father nor a mother, and there is no place to send the citation for merit I have earned twice. Just now, when you were speaking, the more I listened, the more it sounded like the voice of my own mother. I want to dedicate these two citations for merit to you, to the representatives of the people of the whole country, which is also dedicated to my own mother! I also want to guarantee to my mother, to the people of the whole country, and to the Party and Chairman Mao: I will spare no effort and life to protect you!"

　　A Gift from the Coastal Defense Soldiers
    Here is a solid coastal defense position guarded by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. On March 16th, the coastal defense soldiers stationed here gave the delegation that came here to express their regards a live ammunition combat shooting exercise on the yellow sand-covered beach.
    At 10:30, a red signal flare rose into the air, and the commander issued a battle order. A squad from a machine gun company of a certain unit began combat shooting. "Bang, bang..." Wherever the bullets went, the dummy targets fell one by one. The telephonist immediately brought good news: "Report to the commander, all three targets and twelve dummy targets were hit!" Now, a green signal flare has risen again. The fifth squad of a certain unit also began combat shooting. In six minutes, they charged through several trenches about 1,000 meters deep, hitting all six targets and twelve dummy targets, each target hitting more than three bullets. Then, live ammunition exercises with mortars also began, all hitting the target with every shot.
    Tan Yubao, the deputy head of the delegation, and Li Minghao and Li Bogang, the deputy heads of the delegation, couldn't help applauding and cheering after seeing the soldiers' skilled movements and accurate shooting through binoculars. Obviously, they were all proud to have such soldiers guarding the coastal defense of the motherland! The soldiers also felt the greatest glory because they reported their learning achievements to Chairman Mao's envoys. Wang Shoucheng, the squad leader of the fifth squad of a certain unit, held up a dummy chest target with six bullets hitting it and presented it to Tan Yubao, the deputy head of the delegation. All the soldiers in their squad wrote their determination on another target and handed it over to the delegation to take to Chairman Mao. The target reads: "If any enemy dares to invade the territory of the motherland and destroy our great socialist construction, we will, like today, hit every bullet on their heads!" Tan Yubao, the deputy head of the delegation, took over the gift from the soldiers, raised it high and said: "You are the most outstanding sons of the people of the motherland, with you here, we can build with peace of mind!"
    At this time, the comrades of the delegation and the soldiers embraced and lifted the soldiers up. Wang Yuexiang, an old mother of a model martyr, said to the machine gun shooter Chen Youfeng: "I will tell your training achievements to the mothers of the motherland, and ask them to always remember you and support you!"

    慰问解放军代表团在各地
　　祁连山下的欢腾
    三月四日。祁连山还笼罩着皑皑的白雪。驻在这里的中国人民解放军某部的全体指挥员战斗员们欢腾起来了。他们从四面八方汇集起来，站在甘青公路的两旁，殷切地盼望着亲人到来。
    这里是甘肃、青海交界的地方。这里的一座铁桥早被战士们换上了新装。桥的两头镶着各种花边，东头贴着一幅对联：“甘青路上扎彩门，祁连山下迎亲人。”从这里，到营房的驻地共布置了七个彩门，上面都挂着“迎接全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团”的巨幅匾额。沿着公路的许多地方，贴着近二百条欢迎慰问团的红绿色标语。这些，都是战士们精心制成的。今天天还未明，他们又在彩门上挂上了彩球、花灯，重新打扫了公路。
    现在，他们都站在这里，怀着愉快而又急切的心情，等待着亲人到来。
    “来了！来了！”队伍的前面，桥头上响起了雷动的掌声和口号声。几辆眩目的彩车徐徐地驶近了欢迎的人群。
    “同志们身体健康！”代表们下车后喊叫着。这是祖国人民的声音，毛主席的声音！它好象电流一样，迅速地穿过了战士的身上，激动着每一个战士的心。
    “毛主席、朱总司令身体健康！”
    “同志们辛苦了！”
    “为人民服务！”
    战士们象潮水般地向代表涌去，紧紧地握手，亲热地拥抱。一束束的鲜花送到了代表的手里，彩纸象五彩缤纷的花瓣一样飞向天空，又落在代表们头上、身上、车上。
    部队的首长陪同代表们通过欢迎的行列时，口号声，掌声，锣鼓声，鞭炮声，此起彼伏，它震撼着冰雪覆盖的山谷，淹没了桥下急流奔腾的声音。战士们举起鲜花，高声呼喊着：“感谢全国人民和毛主席对我们亲切的关怀和挚诚的慰问！”“加强学习，为建设强大的国防军，保卫祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗……”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（蒲景林　祝方泰）
　　“保卫您啊，亲爱的母亲！”
    二月十九日，慰问团到了河南军区政治部。代表团中的一位老大娘受到了大家热烈欢迎。这位老大娘的名字叫王秀鸾，是拥军优属模范，也是劳动模范。她的大儿子在解放西南的战役中牺牲了，接着，她又把自己的二儿子送到了部队。因此，战士们都亲昵地称她为“子弟兵的母亲”。
    这天，她刚讲完话，蒋泰贞就飞快地跑回宿舍里，把自己的立功喜报拿出来，恭恭敬敬地送到了王老大娘的手里，激动地说：“我没有了父亲，也没有了母亲，两次立功的喜报都没有地方寄。刚才，你在讲话时，我越听越象我亲生母亲的声音，我要把这两张立功喜报献给你，献给全国人民的代表，也就是献给了我亲生的母亲！我还要向母亲，向全国人民，向党和毛主席保证：我要不惜自己的精力和生命，来保卫你们！”

　　海防战士的献礼
    这里是解放军某部守卫着的坚固海防阵地。三月十六日，驻在这里的海防战士，在黄砂弥漫的海滩上，给到这里进行慰问的代表团举行了实弹战斗射击演习。
    十时三十分，红色信号弹腾空而起，指挥员发出了战斗的命令。某部机关枪连的一个班，开始了战斗射击。“啪，啪……”子弹到处，人靶一个个地倒了下去。电话员立即传来了捷报：“报告指挥员同志，三个目标十二个人靶全部命中！”现在，绿色信号弹又升起了。某部第五班也开始了战斗射击。六分钟里，他们冲击了一千公尺左右纵深的数道堑壕，全部命中六个目标十二个人靶，每个靶都命中三发以上的子弹。接着，迫击炮实弹演习也开始了，都是百发百中。
    慰问团的谭余保副总团长，李明灏、李伯刚副团长，从望远镜里看到战士们纯熟的动作和准备的射击，都不由得鼓掌欢呼起来。显然，他们都因为有这样的战士守卫着祖国的海防而感到骄傲！战士们也因为给毛主席的使者汇报了学习成绩，而感到最大光荣。某部五班班长王守成，高举着一个命中六发子弹的人胸靶，献给了谭余保副总团长。他们全班战士又在另一个靶上写下了自己的决心，交慰问团带给毛主席。靶上写着：“如果任何敌人敢来侵犯祖国领土，破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设，我们就象今天这样，把每发子弹都打在他们的头上！”谭余保副总团长，接过来战士的献礼，把它高高举起说：“你们是祖国人民最优秀的儿子，有了你们在这里，我们就可以放心建设了！”
    这时，代表团的同志和战士们拥抱起来了，把战士们抬起来了。模范烈属王月香老妈妈，对机枪射手陈有峰说：“我要把你们的练兵成绩，都告诉给祖国的母亲们，叫她们永远记着你们，支援你们！”
