    Experiences and Problems in Promoting New Technologies
    Shao Xianghua, Chief of Technology Department and Chief Engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel

    Over the past few years, Anshan Iron and Steel has adopted a series of new technologies in its production process.
    For example, according to the original production process under the puppet Manchurian regime, iron smelting mainly used rich ore as raw material. In addition, poor ore was made into so-called artificial rich ore by means of sintering and pelletizing, which accounted for only a small portion of the iron smelting raw materials. Because they believed that blast furnaces could not operate smoothly with too much sintered ore, and they also believed that the pig iron smelted from Anshan's raw materials could not have low silicon content, they adopted the British and German duplex process for steelmaking. In addition to open-hearth furnaces, the steelmaking plant also built many pre-refining furnaces with structures very similar to open-hearth furnaces, mainly to pre-treat the molten iron before it entered the open-hearth furnace to remove excess silicon. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, such indirect operations are completely unnecessary. Under the advice and specific guidance of Soviet experts, we made major reforms to the operating methods at all stages of the entire production process, not only smelting steelmaking pig iron that met the standards for direct entry into the open-hearth furnace, but also greatly increasing production.
    New methods were also adopted in sintering, which greatly increased the output of the sintering machine and also increased the alkalinity of the sintered ore. Due to the successful smelting of standard steelmaking pig iron, the original pre-refining furnace duplex operation method used in the steelmaking plant lost its significance, allowing the original pre-refining furnace to be transformed into a steelmaking open-hearth furnace, thereby increasing the total hearth area of the open-hearth furnace by 56 percent. These facts tell us that adopting new technical operations in the smelting system is the most important way to increase production.
    In rolling steel and other mechanical processing departments, technological innovation mainly utilized methods of improving tools. Here, the anti-encircling disk created by Comrade Zhang Mingshan, as well as many important creations by Comrades Li Genyuan, Wang Chonglun and others that emerged in the mechanicalization movement under the call of the Party, were all created from the rich practical production experience of the operating workers. These tool improvements have played a very significant role in increasing production in Anshan Iron and Steel's mechanical processing plants.
    In order to meet the ever-increasing requirements for product quality, all producers must strictly abide by the various rules in production activities, such as technical regulations (operating procedures) and production culture (cleanliness system). In the early days of Anshan Iron and Steel's recovery of production, many product quality defects were caused by failure to comply with these basic rules. Under the circumstances at that time, the main issues were to strengthen education and establish necessary management systems, such as inspection systems and reward and punishment systems. These problems still exist at present; but after a general management system has been established and basically implemented, further improvement of quality requires improvement in the operating technology itself. There are also many examples of this in Anshan Iron and Steel. For example, when manufacturing high-grade steel, the original steelmaking technology was not sufficient to guarantee the required quality, and the operation must be fundamentally changed to ensure the high purity of the finished product. Another example is that due to the intensification of operations in steel plants, the quality requirements for refractory materials are constantly increasing, so new technologies also need to be adopted in the manufacture of refractory materials. For us, these are all new technologies.
    Another situation in which new technologies are adopted is in new factories. The seamless steel pipe plant and large-scale rolling steel plant of Anshan Iron and Steel were all equipped with the latest Soviet designs. The construction and installation of these factories were completed in a very short period of time, as a result of the adoption of many new technologies. In terms of the production process, the content of new technologies in these factories is also very rich. In order to master these new technologies, in addition to mainly relying on the direct guidance of Soviet commissioning experts and sending personnel to the Soviet Union for study, some equipment was also used to determine specific operating conditions through a series of experiments conducted by ourselves.
    The process by which Anshan Iron and Steel has mastered new technologies over the past few years is actually a process of learning from the Soviet Union. The majority of the new technologies mentioned above are the Soviet methods that have been completed with the help of Soviet experts.
    However, new technologies themselves are often not mechanical and immutable, and can be implemented in any condition. Instead, they need to be tested or researched according to the raw materials, equipment, and other conditions of different regions or factories in order to find and master the most suitable specific implementation methods. It is particularly worth pointing out that in the process of experimenting, researching, and mastering new technologies, many difficulties are often encountered, including partial or temporary failures. Only through persistent research and improvement can success be achieved in the end. For example, last year we had two blast furnaces shut down for repairs. In the past, high material level shutdown method was used, the main disadvantage of which was that it took a long time and arduous labor to dig out a large amount of material from the furnace, seriously delaying production. Last year, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and tried the low material level shutdown method. In addition to simplifying operations and saving labor, the most significant advantage of this new shutdown method is shortening the furnace shutdown and repair time. However, when we tried this method for the first time, due to lack of experience, an accident occurred during the shutdown process. When another blast furnace was shut down, we learned from the experience and lessons of the first time and mastered this new shutdown method. Our experience is that any technological innovation may go through a period of unsuccessful stage before it can be finally completed, because it cannot rely on the original experience and the new experience cannot be mastered immediately, and it is not possible to succeed in one fell swoop.
    The following example illustrates systematic research on new technologies: In the trial production of blast furnace bricks, we spent several months researching the entire production process, aiming at our raw material and equipment conditions, to find the most appropriate temperature and ingredient composition, etc., to meet the quality requirements of the new specifications. Another example is the trial production of new specification fishplates, which also went through a series of experiments and research in the laboratory and existing equipment on site to find new heat treatment conditions.
    In order to strengthen the mastery of new technologies, Anshan Iron and Steel established a special organization for metallurgical research in the Central Laboratory, and expanded the work of chemical and refractory materials laboratories from product inspection to focusing on research and experimentation. Experience has proved that this is very helpful for promoting new technologies. Some new technology research and experiments, in addition to our internal forces, also need to cooperate with scientific research institutions and universities. For example, the above-mentioned research on blast furnace bricks was completed with the strong participation of the Institute of Metals of the Academy of Sciences.
    In addition, the organizational leadership for research and adoption of new technologies should have clear purpose and planning. We are not doing new technologies for the sake of new technologies; but learn, research and implement new technologies based on the problems existing in the production process. We learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After the annual and quarterly production tasks are determined, each factory and mine must formulate a technical organization measures plan, which is a concrete action plan to ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the state plan. When formulating this plan, we should identify the main problems in production and formulate various measures to solve these problems. In addition to organizational or other measures, the content of the technical organization measures plan is mainly a plan to master new technologies and promote new technologies, including the transformation or supplementation of certain equipment.
    In addition to this, plans are also prepared in advance for the technical research work carried out throughout the company, and then carried out according to the plan. All technical organization measures plans and research and experiment plans are reviewed and approved by the production manager, and major ones are submitted to the Ministry of Heavy Industry for approval. Through these methods, we are gradually increasing the planning and purposefulness of promoting new technologies in order to serve the improvement of production more concentratedly and effectively.
    Anshan Iron and Steel also has many problems in promoting new technologies. Experience has proved that the joint cooperation of engineering and technical personnel and employees is very necessary in the process of factories mastering new technologies. At present, there is still a relative lack of engineering and technical personnel with theoretical knowledge and practical experience, the strength of organizing new technology research and experiments in all departments is still insufficient, some people often consider individuals or their own units too much, the collective spirit of unity and mutual assistance is not enough, especially the combination with the masses of workers is not close enough, so it is often impossible to obtain complete experience in time, delaying the mastery of new technologies. In addition, conservative habits often play a certain hindering role in the process of implementing new technologies. Therefore, improving the political and professional level of engineering and technical personnel and employees and strengthening the combination of labor and technology are very necessary conditions for further promoting new technologies.
    Promoting new technologies on existing equipment is sometimes limited by equipment conditions that cannot be resolved for a while. For example, high-pressure blast furnace operation is a very effective measure to increase the production capacity of blast furnaces and reduce coke consumption. This new technology has achieved very successful experience in the Soviet Union, but because the blower must supply higher pressure wind to realize this operation, and the furnace body and gas system must also have a structure suitable for high pressure, many blast furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel cannot be adopted immediately at present and can only be considered for adoption in the future when renovating and overhauling blast furnaces. Soviet experts told us that before each equipment is shut down for repair, necessary and possible modifications should be considered in advance to create conditions for adopting new technologies. This is also what Anshan Iron and Steel will further implement in the future.

    推行新技术的经验和问题
    鞍钢技术处处长总工程师　邵象华
    鞍钢几年来的生产过程中，采用了一系列新的技术。
    例如，按伪满原有的生产过程，炼铁主要用富矿石为原料，另外，用烧结和团矿的方法将贫矿石制成所谓人造富矿，作为炼铁原料的一小半。因为他们认为高炉用过多的烧结矿石是不能顺利操作的，还认为用鞍山的原料炼出来的生铁含矽不能低，因此炼钢采用了英国和德国的二重法，炼钢厂除平炉外还建造了许多构造与平炉极为相似的预炼炉，主要用以将铁水在进平炉以前预先处理一遍，除去所含的过剩的矽。根据苏联的先进经验，这样的间接操作完全是不必要的。在苏联专家们的建议和具体指导下，我们在整个生产过程的各阶段对操作方法先后作了重大的改革，不但炼出了合乎直接进平炉标准的炼钢生铁，而且产量大为提高。
    在烧结方面也采用了新的方法，使烧结机的产量大为提高，同时还提高了烧结矿的碱度。由于标准炼钢生铁的制炼成功，炼钢厂原用的预炼炉二重操作法就失去了意义，而使原有的预炼炉可以改造为炼钢平炉，从而增大平炉总炉底面积达百分之五十六。这些事实告诉我们：在冶炼系统中，采用新的技术操作乃是提高生产的最重要的途径。
    在轧钢和其他机械加工的各部门中，技术革新主要是利用了改进工具的方法。在这里，张明山同志所创造的反围盘以及其后在党的号召下展开机械化运动中所出现的栗根源、王崇伦等同志许多重要的创造，都是由操作工人丰富的实际生产经验中创造出来的。这些工具上的改进，对于鞍钢的机械加工各厂提高生产起了极显著的作用。
    为了满足对产品质量不断提高的要求，所有的生产者还必须严格遵守生产活动中的各项规则，如技术规程（操作规程）生产文化（整洁制度）等。在鞍钢恢复生产的初期，有许多产品质量上的缺陷是由于未能遵守这些基本规则而造成的。在当时的情况下，主要的问题是加强教育，建立必要的管理制度，如检查制度、奖惩制度等。这些问题在目前依然也是存在的；但在一般的管理制度已经建立而且基本上贯彻之后，进一步地提高质量就要求在操作技术本身有所提高。在这方面，鞍钢也有不少的例子。如制造高级钢材的时候，原有的炼钢技术就不足以保证所需的质量，必须根本改变操作以保证成品的高度纯净了。又如钢铁工厂由于操作的强化，对于耐火材料的质量要求不断提高，因此在耐火材料的制造上也需要采用新技术。对我们来说，这些都是新技术。
    采用新技术的另一种情况是新的工厂。鞍钢的无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂，全部设备是苏联的最新设计，这些工厂在很短时间内施工和安装完成，是采用了许多新技术的结果。在生产过程上，这些工厂中新技术的内容也非常丰富。为了掌握这些新技术，我们除了主要依靠苏联开工专家的直接指导和派遣人员到苏联去学习外，也有一部分设备是由自己进行了一系列试验来确定具体操作条件的。
    鞍钢几年来掌握新技术的过程，实际上也就是学习苏联的过程。前面所述的许多新技术，极大部分就都是在苏联专家的帮助下采用的苏联已经完成的方法。
    但是，新技术本身往往并不是机械的，一成不变的，在任何条件下都能搬来就实行的。而是需要根据不同地区或工厂的原料、设备、及其他条件作必要的试验或研究，才能找出并掌握最适宜的具体实行方法。特别值得指出的是在新技术的试验研究及掌握过程中，经常会遇到不少困难，包括局部的或暂时的失败，只有经过坚持的研究改进，最后才达成功。例如去年我们曾经有两个高炉停炉进行修理。以往停炉都采用高料线停炉法，其主要缺点是从炉内扒出大量材料需要很长的时间和繁重的劳动，严重地耽误了生产。去年我们学习苏联的先进经验，试行低料线停炉法。这种新的停炉法除了简化操作和节省劳动力之外，最重大的优点是缩短炉子停修时间。但是，我们在第一次试用此法时，由于缺乏经验，在停炉过程中曾造成了事故。到另一高炉停炉时，接受了第一次的经验教训才掌握了这种新的停炉方法。我们的体会是：任何技术上的革新，由于不能依靠原有的经验，而新的经验又不能立即掌握，所以都可能经过一段不顺利的阶段才能最后完成，并不是一举就能成功的。
    新技术的系统研究工作，可以举下面的例子：在高炉砖的试制中，针对我们的原料及设备条件，我们曾以几个月的时间进行了整个生产过程的研究，才找出了最适当的温度和配料成分等等，达到了新规格要求的质量。又如新规格鱼尾板的试制，也是经过试验室的和现场已有设备中的一系列试验研究，才找到了新的热处理条件。
    为了加强对新技术的掌握，鞍钢在中央试验室中成立了冶金研究的专门机构，并将化工、耐火材料等试验室的工作从产品检验扩展到以研究试验为重点。经验证明，这样做对于推行新技术是很有作用的。有些新技术的研究试验，除了我们内部的力量以外，还需要和科学研究机关及高等学校合作。例如上述高炉砖的研究，就是在科学院金属研究所的大力参加之下完成的。
    此外，对于研究、采用新技术的组织领导，应该有明确的目的性和计划性。我们不是为新技术而新技术；而是根据生产过程中所存在的问题来学习、研究和贯彻新技术。我们学习苏联的先进经验，各厂矿在年度和季度的生产任务确定以后要制订技术组织措施计划，也就是保证完成或超额完成国家计划的具体行动计划。制订这个计划时，应找出生产中的主要问题，订出解决这些问题的各项措施。除了组织上的或其他方面的措施以外，技术组织措施计划的内容主要是掌握新技术和推行新技术的计划，其中包括若干设备的改造或补充。
    除此以外，对于全公司范围内所进行的技术研究工作，也预先编制计划，然后按计划进行。所有的技术组织措施计划以及研究试验计划，都经过生产经理的审查批准，重大的并呈请重工业部批准。经过这些方法，我们正在逐渐地增大推行新技术的计划性和目的性，以便更集中更有效地为提高生产服务。
    鞍钢在推行新技术方面也还存在着不少问题。经验证明，在工厂掌握新技术的过程中，工程技术人员和职工的共同合作是非常必要的。目前具有理论修养和实际经验的工程技术人员还比较缺乏，在所有部门组织新技术研究试验的力量仍感不足，一部分人员对个人或本单位的考虑往往过多，团结互助的集体主义观念不够，尤其是与工人群众的结合不够密切，因此往往不能及时取得完整的经验，使新技术的掌握受到拖延。此外在贯彻新技术的过程中，守旧的习惯也往往起着一定的阻碍作用。因此提高工程技术人员和职工的政治业务水平，加强劳动与技术的结合，是进一步推行新技术非常必要的条件。
    在原有的设备上推行新技术，有时也受到一时不能解决的设备条件的限制。例如高压鼓风操作，是提高高炉生产能力、降低焦炭消耗很有效的措施。这项新技术在苏联已取得很成功的经验，但由于实现这种操作必须鼓风机能供给较高压力的风，炉体和瓦斯系统也必须有适应高压的构造，所以鞍钢的许多高炉在目前还不能立即采用，必须在今后改建和大修高炉时，才能考虑采用。苏联专家告诉我们，在每一项设备停工修理以前，都应该预先考虑作必要与可能的修改，为采用新技术创造条件。这一点也是鞍钢要在今后进一步贯彻的。
