    Preliminary Experiences of Yumen Mining Bureau in Organizing Production Internships for Students from Various Schools
    Yumen Mining Bureau Personnel Department
    From 1951 to 1953, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 792 college students came to our mine for internships. During these years, our mine has been continuously improving the organization and leadership, and political and ideological education for the intern students. The internship results of the students have also improved year by year. Now we are sharing some preliminary experiences.
    First, let's talk about organization and leadership. In the summer of 1951, a total of 169 students came to our mine for internships. According to the instructions of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, we formed an internship guidance committee composed of heads of various units to preside over the internship work. However, due to the large organization and numerous members, it was difficult to convene meetings; and the heads of various units were too busy with their work to take on specific tasks, so this committee could not play an effective leadership role. In 1952, we changed the organizational form and formed an internship guidance group composed of the heads of various units related to the internship work, relevant comrades from the Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League, and comrades doing specific work, with a deputy director serving as the group leader; internship guidance subgroups were formed in each factory and team, with the deputy factory director in charge of personnel management serving as the subgroup leader. The main responsibilities of the internship guidance group are: 1. Contacting the General Bureau and various colleges and universities, receiving intern students to the mine, and assigning them to relevant units for internships according to the internship content; 2. Providing security education, confidentiality education, and political and ideological education to the intern students, and being responsible for taking care of the intern students' food and lodging; 3. Reviewing and approving internship plans, and supervising and inspecting the work of the internship guidance subgroups in each factory and team; 4. Being responsible for solving major problems that cannot be solved by the factories and teams during the internship. The main responsibilities of the guidance subgroups in each factory and team are: 1. Working with relevant personnel of the internship guidance group and internship teachers to formulate internship plans, which are implemented after being approved by the guidance group; 2. Taking direct leadership and organizational responsibility for the intern students' on-site internships, and carrying out specific security, confidentiality, and labor discipline education in conjunction with the on-site situation, mobilizing the technical cadres and workers of the unit to actively assist and promote the internship work, and organizing various special reports to correct the shortcomings and biases in the internship work in a timely manner to ensure the completion of the internship plan; 3. Organizing forums for intern students and labor models or veteran workers, and being responsible for the intern students' ideological summaries and evaluations.
    In this way, there are relatively sound production internship leadership organizations from the bureau to the factories and teams, and the scope of responsibilities of these organizations is also relatively clear. Therefore, from the first day the intern students arrive at the mine, their internship and life problems are arranged, and there are dedicated people responsible for their ideological leadership, so the internship work can be completed smoothly.
    Like other tasks, leadership's attention is the basic guarantee for doing a good job in internships. The leadership of the Yumen Mining Bureau pays more attention to the work of college students coming to the mine for internships. The mine's leadership has opened up the thinking of factory and team leaders from all aspects, and has been closely monitoring and inspecting the internship work. From the perspective of each factory and team, the success or failure of the internship is mostly determined by whether the leaders of each unit attach importance to the internship work. For example, when the leadership of the oil production plant started the internship work last year, they immediately convened relevant cadres and veteran masters from the entire plant to mobilize them. The head of the internship guidance subgroup clarified the importance of the internship work at the meeting, emphasizing that the intern students are the future fresh troops on our petroleum industrial front. We must regard the internship work as a major and glorious political task and complete it in the same way as the production tasks. After several ideological mobilizations, the entire plant, from top to bottom, paid more attention to the internship. Although the production tasks were tight at the time, the responsible comrades in the plant were generally able to give special reports to the intern students and answer questions on time according to the internship schedule. Therefore, the students' internship results were also better. For example, out of the 26 students from the Department of Petroleum Engineering of Tsinghua University who interned at the oil production plant, 22 scored 5 points and 4 scored 4 points in the final exam. The leadership of the drilling department also attached great importance to the internship work, so the students' internship results were also better. The drilling department divided the intern students into four groups and used the group rotation method to guide the internship, which significantly improved the efficiency of the internship. However, the leadership of the oil refining plant did not pay enough attention to the internship work. Individual technical office leaders and technical cadres in the plant regarded the internship work as a troublesome matter and adopted a perfunctory attitude. Last year, intern students from Lanzhou University asked them to give a special report. The engineers kept pushing it back and finally let a technician who had been in the oil refining plant for less than a year give two reports, which the intern students were very dissatisfied with. During the internship, the plant's leadership lacked necessary care for the intern students, especially technical guidance. Therefore, the intern students' grades in this plant were generally not good.
    Leadership's attention also includes the leadership personally solving some important specific problems. For example, last year, the number of employees in our mine increased sharply, and the construction of dormitories could not keep up with the needs for a while. Many comrades who had been transferred to civilian work lived in mobile houses. Whether the dormitory problem could be solved became a practical problem for whether the intern students could come to the mine. The internship guidance group specifically discussed this issue and decided to temporarily not allocate part of the newly built employee dormitories to the mine's employees, but to allocate more than 20 rooms for the intern students to live in, which ensured that the intern students could come to the mine for internships on time. During the internship, because the tasks of production and capital construction were tight and the transportation vehicles were not enough, sometimes the intern students did not have a car to go to the site, or they did not have a car to come back after arriving at the site, so the transportation problem became a serious problem. After several studies by the deputy director, the head of the personnel department, and the leaders of relevant units, this problem was largely resolved.
    Formulating a practical internship plan is one of the keys to ensuring internship results. The process of formulating the internship plan in our mine is: the technical education section of the personnel department assists the personnel section (shares) of the unit where the intern students are located, according to the different purposes and requirements of each school, combined with the situation of our mine, consults with the comrades leading the internship in the school, and drafts it after full research, then submits it to the engineer for supplementary revisions, and finally submits it to the bureau guidance group through the factory and team guidance subgroup for approval. These plans are generally feasible. However, because some intern students have excessive demands, the plans often cannot be implemented. For example, some intern students require completing an internship plan that others can only complete in one and a half months in more than ten days; there are also situations where, although there are only two or three intern students, they must ask the leaders to give many reports, or they must ask the highest technical cadres to give reports. When these excessive demands are not met, some intern students' emotions become unstable, and their internship results are greatly affected.
    It is very important to do a good job in political and ideological education for intern students. This work should be carried out in the school before the intern students leave, and after they arrive at the mine, the mine's leadership should also carry it out. These two aspects cannot be neglected.
    In our mine, the work in this area is generally carried out after the intern students arrive at the mine. Leaders and cadres such as the bureau director and the head of the personnel department give reports on "The Prospects for the Development of the Motherland's Petroleum Industry," "Introduction to the Mine's History and Current Situation," "Safety and Confidentiality Issues," and "Introduction to Past Internship Experiences and Matters Needing Attention During the Internship," and organize the intern students to discuss in groups and formulate internship agreements and group internship discipline. During the internship, life review meetings are also held regularly, and political and current affairs studies are organized.
    Generally speaking, colleges and universities pay more attention to the organization and education work for students before they come to the mine. The first batch of intern students from North China had a higher level of awareness and were better organized. They actively participated in the installation project of the cracking and refining plant, carrying pipes, lifting machines, and working with the workers. In 1952, the intern students from Tianjin University had strong leadership and good organizational discipline; and they were able to care about the mine's production and actively participate in the factory's work and various activities. The above-mentioned students have gained a lot from their internships, and their internship reports have become one of the most popular reference materials for students who come to our mine for internships and for our mine's technical cadres. Most of the intern students who came to the mine in the summer of 1953 were better, and their internship results were also great.
    However, in the past, a small number of intern students, due to insufficient political and ideological education before coming to the mine, lacked a correct understanding of the motherland's petroleum industry and internship work, and had lax organizational discipline. They caused many problems during the internship and caused a lot of losses. For example, in 1952, individual intern students from a school in Shanghai disobeyed the guidance of on-site personnel, resulting in a serious accident: a fellow ironworker's leg was broken, and intern student Wang Jimo was also seriously injured (the mine was also responsible for this incident and has been dealt with afterwards). Some intern students made trouble because the mine's employee mess hall did not have rice, and even resolutely refused to join the mess hall, cooking their own food in small pots; some intern students disliked the old sheepskin issued to them for being smelly and hung it outside the house to be exposed to the wind and rain. This gave the worker comrades a very bad impression. Our living conditions here are naturally worse than in the city. Currently, the mine is relatively short of houses, and the workers work hard and live in dormitories that are not very good; but some intern students complain that the houses are small and crowded, and make trouble. Even in 1953, there were still individual intern students who complained that life was too hard and demanded that they only intern for six hours a day. They did not study when they arrived at the construction site, but sat idly by the wellhead.
    In addition, there is a relatively common phenomenon among intern students of not paying enough attention to production. For example, some intern students do not consider the difficulties of the production unit and insist on disassembling the machine themselves; some intern students want to change the operation to see what happens without permission, and secretly do it, causing abnormal production; some intern students mechanically adhere to their own internship plans regardless of the urgency of the production task. These all make the production department feel difficult. But as long as attention is paid to their political and ideological education, they will be able to correct these shortcomings.
    According to our experience, it is very helpful for the internship to have intern students and workers become one, establish relationships, teach and learn from each other through cultural and recreational activities, sports, and forums. After the workers and students are familiar with each other, the workers can generally explain the practical knowledge of production to the intern students enthusiastically and patiently; some workers do not leave work when it is time to get off work and must finish explaining to the students, and some even draw sketches back in the dormitory and send them to the intern students' dormitories. In addition to humbly learning from the workers, many intern students also gave the veteran masters some production theories and helped the workers carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. As a result of this mutual help and mutual learning, the students' problems, especially practical problems, were solved in a timely manner, making the internship more in-depth; the workers also improved in terms of theory. When the intern students from the Department of Petroleum Engineering of Tsinghua University left last year, some exchanged photos with the workers and left mailing addresses, and they maintained contact with each other for a considerable period of time afterwards.
    In recent years, our mine has begun to explore some experiences due to its emphasis on internship work. However, due to busy production tasks and a shortage of skilled technical cadres, the specific help given to the intern students is not enough. Because the production situation is not stable enough, the implementation of the internship plan sometimes has to be changed. In particular, some factories and teams do not do a good enough job in giving special reports, answering questions, and providing necessary reference materials, and often cannot meet the requirements of the intern students. Our care for the internship work is also not comprehensive enough. Generally speaking, better care is given to large batches of students coming to the mine and students coming to the mine in the summer, while poorer care is given to individual students coming to the mine and students coming to the mine at ordinary times. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the internship plans formulated for them are not specific and detailed enough, and the on-site organization and leadership are also poor. In addition, the cooperation between the labor union, the Communist Youth League, and the administration in the internship work is not good enough, and they have not been able to better integrate the intern students with the workers through some necessary activities in a timely manner. We will strive to improve these shortcomings in future internship work.

    玉门矿务局组织各校学生进行生产实习的初步经验
    玉门矿务局人事处
    从一九五一年到一九五三年，先后来本矿实习的高等学校学生，根据不完全的统计，共有七百九十二人。在这几年当中，本矿对实习同学的组织领导、政治思想教育等工作，不断改进着。实习同学的实习成绩也年年有所提高。现在我们把一些初步经验介绍出来。
    首先谈一下组织、领导问题。一九五一年暑期来本矿实习的同学共一百六十九人。我们遵照中央燃料工业部石油管理总局的指示，由各单位负责人组成了实习指导委员会，主持实习工作。但是，由于组织庞大，委员众多，召集会议困难；而各单位负责人又因工作太忙，实际上不能担任具体工作，所以这个委员会不能发挥有效的领导作用。一九五二年我们便改变了组织形式，由和实习工作有关的各单位负责人，党、工会和青年团的有关同志以及作具体工作的同志组成了实习指导组，由副局长一人担任组长；在各厂、队组成实习指导小组，由管理人事工作的副厂长担任小组长。实习指导组的主要职责是：一、和总局及各院校联系，接受实习同学来矿，并按实习内容分配他们到有关单位实习；二、对实习同学进行保密教育、安全教育及政治思想教育，并负责照顾实习同学的食宿等问题；三、审查和批准实习计划，并督促和检查各厂、队实习指导小组的工作；四、负责解决实习中各厂、队所不能解决的重大问题。各厂、队指导小组的主要职责是：一、协同实习指导组的有关人员和实习领导教师制订实习计划，经指导组批准后执行；二、对实习同学现场实习负直接领导和组织之责，结合现场情况进行具体的保安、保密及劳动纪律的教育，动员本单位技术干部和工人积极协助和推动实习工作，并组织各种专题报告，及时纠正实习工作中的缺点和偏向，以保证实习计划的完成；三、组织实习同学和劳动模范或老工人座谈会，负责实习同学的思想总结及鉴定等工作。
    这样，由局到厂、队都有了比较健全的生产实习领导机构，这些机构的职责范围也比较明确。所以从实习同学到矿的第一天起，他们的实习和生活问题就都有人安排，也有专人来负责对于他们的思想领导，实习工作也就能够顺利完成了。
    正如其他各项工作一样，领导重视是搞好实习工作的基本保证。玉门矿务局的领导方面对于高等学校学生来矿实习的工作是比较重视的。矿的领导方面曾从各方面打通厂、队领导人员的思想，并抓紧对实习工作的督促和检查。从各厂、队看，实习成绩的好坏，也多半决定于各单位领导人员的是否重视实习工作。例如去年采油厂的领导方面在实习工作开始时，即召集全厂有关干部和老师傅进行动员，由实习指导小组长在会上讲清了实习工作的重要性，着重指出：实习同学是我们石油工业战线上未来的生力军。我们必须把实习工作看作是重大的光荣的政治任务，同生产任务一样地来完成它。经过几次思想动员，全厂从上到下都比较重视实习，虽然当时生产任务很紧，一般仍能按照实习日程，由厂里的负责同志按时给实习同学作专题报告，解答问题。因此学生实习的成绩也较好。如清华大学石油工程系在采油厂实习的二十六人，在最后考试中二十二人得五分，四人得四分。钻井处的领导方面也较重视实习工作，因此学生的实习成绩也较好。钻井处把实习同学分为四组，利用小组轮回制的方法指导实习，显著地提高了实习的效率。但是炼油厂的领导方面对实习工作就不够重视，厂里的个别技术室的领导人员和技术干部，把实习工作看作是麻烦的事，采取敷衍了事的态度。去年兰州大学实习同学要求他们作专题报告，工程师一推再推，最后让刚到炼油厂不到一年的技术员作了两次报告，实习同学们很不满意。在实习中，厂的领导方面对于实习同学也缺少必要的照顾，尤其是缺乏技术上的指导。因此在这个厂，实习同学的成绩一般都不够好。
    领导重视，还包括领导方面亲自解决一些重要的具体问题。例如，去年本矿职工人数激增，宿舍建筑一时赶不上需要，很多转业来的同志都住在活动房子里。当时宿舍问题能否解决，就成了实习同学能否来矿的一个实际问题。实习指导组专门讨论了这个问题，决定将新建的职工宿舍的一部分暂时不分配给本矿职工，拨出二十多间供实习同学住宿，这才保证了实习同学能够按时来矿实习。在实习过程中，因为生产和基本建设的任务紧，运输车辆不够用，有时候实习同学没有车子去现场，或到了现场没有车子可以回来，交通问题又成了一个严重问题。经过副局长、人事处长和有关单位的领导同志几次研究，这个问题才大体上得到了解决。
    制订切合实际的实习计划，是保证实习成绩的关键之一。本矿实习计划的制订过程是：由人事处技术教育科协助实习同学所在单位的人事科（股），按照各学校不同的目的和要求，结合本矿情况，会同学校领导实习的同志，经充分研究，拟定出来，然后交工程师补充修改，最后再经厂队指导小组送局指导组批准。这些计划，一般都是切实可行的。但也因为有部分实习同学要求过高，使计划常常无法执行。如有的实习同学要求在十多天里面完成别人一个半月才能完成的实习计划；也有这样的情形，虽然只有两三个实习同学，却一定要领导同志给作很多报告，或是一定要最高技术干部作报告。在这些过高的要求得不到满足时，有些实习同学的情绪就不太安定，因而实习成绩也大受影响。
    对实习同学做好政治思想教育工作，是十分重要的。这项工作在实习同学出发以前要在学校进行，到矿以后，矿的领导方面也要进行。这两方面不可偏废。
    本矿在这方面的工作，一般是在实习同学到矿后，由局长、人事处长等领导干部，作关于“祖国石油工业发展的远景”、“本矿沿革及目前情况介绍”、“安全保密问题”、“介绍过去实习经验及实习中应注意的事项”等报告，并组织实习同学分组讨论，制订实习公约、小组实习纪律等。在实习过程中，还定期地举行生活检讨会，并组织政治及时事学习。
    高等学校对学生来矿以前的组织和教育工作，总的说来，都是比较注意的。最初来的华北区的实习同学，觉悟程度较高，组织也较好，他们主动地参加了裂炼厂的安装工程，扛管子，抬机器，和工人一块儿劳动。一九五二年天津大学来的实习同学，因为领导力量很强，实习同学的组织性纪律性都比较好；并且能够关心矿上的生产，主动地参加工厂的工作和各项活动。上述这些同学在实习中都有很大的收获，他们的实习报告，成为以后来本矿实习的同学及本矿技术干部所最欢迎的参考资料之一。一九五三年暑期来矿的实习同学，绝大部分都较好，实习成绩也很大。
    但过去也有少数实习同学，由于来矿前的政治思想教育不够，他们对祖国的石油事业和实习工作都缺乏正确的认识，组织纪律松懈，在实习中出了很多问题，造成了不少的损失。例如一九五二年上海某校的个别实习同学，不服从现场人员指导，以致造成了严重事故：把一个铁工同志的腿折断，实习同学王继谟也受了重伤（这一事件矿上也有责任，事后已作处理）。有的实习同学因矿上职工伙食团没有大米吃而闹情绪，甚至坚决不入伙食团，自己用小锅作饭吃；有的实习同学嫌发给的老羊皮臭，挂在房外任风吹雨打。这都给工人同志以很不好的影响。我们这里的生活条件比起城市来自然要差，目前矿上的房子是比较缺的，工人们辛勤劳动，住的宿舍也不太好；而有些实习同学却嫌房子小，住得拥挤，闹情绪。直到一九五三年，还有个别实习同学嫌生活太苦，要求每天只实习六小时，他们到了工地也不学习，却闲坐在井架旁边。
    另外，实习同学比较普遍地存在着不太关心生产的现象。例如：有的实习同学不考虑生产单位的困难，非要自己拆卸机器不可；有的实习同学为了想改变一下操作看看，竟不得允许，就暗自动手，造成生产不正常的现象；有的实习同学不顾生产任务紧急，机械地坚持自己的实习计划。这些都使生产部门感到困难。但只要注意对他们的政治思想教育，他们是能够改正这些缺点的。
    据我们的体会，通过文化娱乐、体育、座谈会等活动，使实习同学和工人打成一片，建立感情，互教互学，对实习是有很大帮助的。工人们和同学们互相熟悉了以后，工人们大都能热情和耐心地给实习同学讲解生产方面的实际知识；有的工人到了点还不下班，一定要给同学们讲完，有的回到宿舍里还画好草图送到实习同学宿舍。不少实习同学除了虚心地向工人学习，也给老师傅们讲些生产理论，并帮助工人们开展文化娱乐和体育活动等。这样互相帮助、互相学习的结果，同学们的问题，特别是实际问题得到了及时的解决，使实习更深入了一步；工人在理论方面也有所提高。去年清华大学石油工程系实习同学临走时有的还和工人交换像片，留下通信地址，后来在相当长的时间内，彼此还保持着联系。
    几年来，本矿由于比较重视实习工作，开始摸索到一些经验。但由于生产任务忙，熟练的技术干部较少，所以对实习同学的具体帮助是不够的。由于生产情况不够平稳，实习计划的执行有时也不得不改变。特别是有些厂、队，在作专题报告、解答问题以及供给必要的参考资料等方面，都做得不够好，常常不能满足实习同学的要求。我们对实习工作照顾得也不够全面。一般说来，对大批来矿和暑期来矿的实习同学照顾较好，对个别来矿和平时来矿的实习同学照顾较差。这主要表现在给他们制订的实习计划不够具体和细致，现场组织领导也较差。此外，工会、青年团和行政在实习工作上的配合还不够好，没有能够及时地通过一些必要的活动，使实习同学更好地和工人结合起来。这些缺点，我们当在今后的实习工作中努力改进。
