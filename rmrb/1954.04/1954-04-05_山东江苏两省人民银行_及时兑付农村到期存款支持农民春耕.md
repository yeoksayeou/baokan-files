    Shandong and Jiangsu Provincial People's Banks
    Timely Cash Rural Deposits to Support Farmers' Spring Planting
    The spring planting season has arrived. People's Banks in Shandong and Jiangsu are adopting various convenient methods to cash deposits made by farmers after selling surplus grain, supporting them in timely spring planting. On one hand, the People's Banks in these two provinces are actively improving counter services in various branches and business offices, simplifying cashing procedures; on the other hand, they are also organizing cadres to go to the countryside for mobile cashing, or adopting methods such as "assigned responsibility for specific areas" and "delivering money to the door"; many areas also entrust rural supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to cash on their behalf. Generally, farmers in various places can withdraw their deposits in time for production. In Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, many farmers have already bought fertilizer with their deposits and applied topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields; some farmers have already used newly purchased cattle with their deposits for spring planting. The People's Bank's simple payment methods have also dispelled the concerns of some farmers who originally believed that "depositing is easy but withdrawing is difficult." Therefore, some farmers have deposited money that they do not need temporarily back into the bank. Beiluo Village in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, recently cashed over 2 million yuan in deposits, and the masses deposited over 1 million yuan back into the bank.

    山东江苏两省人民银行
    及时兑付农村到期存款支持农民春耕
    春耕生产季节到了，山东和江苏各地的人民银行采用各种便利的方法，兑付农民卖余粮后储蓄的款子，支持他们及时进行春耕。这两个省的人民银行一方面积极改善各支行、营业所的柜面服务工作，简化兑付手续；另一方面还组织干部下乡，流动兑付，或者采取“分片包干”、“送款上门”的办法付款；许多地区还委托农村供销合作社和信用合作社代为兑付。各地农民一般都能及时取出存款投入生产。江苏省昆山县不少农民已把存款买了肥田粉，在麦田施了追肥；有些农民在春耕中已使上了用存款新买的耕牛。人民银行简便的付款方法，也打破了部分农民原来认为“存款容易取款难”的思想顾虑，因此，有些农民又把暂时不用的钱存入银行。山东省海阳县北洛村最近兑付了二百多万元存款，群众又存入银行一百多万元。
