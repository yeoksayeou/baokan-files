Xinhua News Agency Report: In the first quarter of 1954, Shanghai's state-owned textile factories achieved new levels of production. The average output of yarn and cloth from nineteen state-owned cotton mills set a new record in the history of Shanghai's textile industry. As of March 25th, the average unit output of cotton yarn (per thousand spindles per hour) reached 64.02 pounds, an increase of 5.4 pounds compared to the average unit output last year; the average unit output of cotton cloth (per machine per hour) reached more than 5 yards. Judging from the current production situation, the yarn and cloth output of these factories in the first quarter of this year can exceed the plan, roughly approaching the level of the fourth quarter of last year, and producing more than 7,000 more bales of yarn and more than 7 million meters of cloth than in the same quarter last year. The output of state-owned woolen mills and silk factories can also exceed the plan. The output of spring clothing materials such as gabardine, serge, flannel, and ladies' suiting exceeded the plan by more than 40,000 meters. Coarse and fine woolen yarn production exceeded the plan by nearly 18,000 kilograms. Silk clothing materials such as "Flower Paris," plain soft satin, "Liuxiang Crepe," and "Yanlaihong" increased by a maximum of over 59 percent more than planned.

In the first quarter of this year, in addition to striving to trial-produce new varieties and create new patterns, the workers and staff of Shanghai's state-owned textile factories also paid attention to using substitutes to save raw materials. For example, the Ninth and Twelfth Cotton Textile Factories learned from Soviet experience and used sodium silicate (water glass) as a desizing agent, reducing the sizing rate of cotton cloth. The amount of dry flour used per bolt of cloth was 39.3 percent less than that of ordinary sizing. After this method was promoted in various factories under the East China Textile Industry Administration Bureau, it could save 62,000 bags of flour a year, and at the same time save 370,000 jin of oil. In this way, the bureau can reduce costs by about 4.15 billion yuan each year. The issue of saving cotton has also attracted the attention of various factories. Last year, the Fourth Cotton Textile Factory averaged 389 jin of cotton per bale of yarn, 5.5 jin less than the average factory. The cotton consumption of the Sixteenth Cotton Textile Factory was also relatively low. The Technical Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau has absorbed the experience of various factories and formulated technical measures to save cotton. Saving cotton and reducing costs will become one of the central tasks of Shanghai's textile industry in the second quarter.

    上海国营纺织工业首季生产达到新水平
    据新华社讯：一九五四年第一季，上海国营纺织厂的生产达到了新的水平。十九个国营棉纺织厂的纱和布的平均产量创造了上海纺织工业史上的新纪录。截至三月二十五日止，棉纱平均单位产量（每千锭时）已达六十四点零二磅，比去年平均单位产量增加五点四磅；棉布平均单位产量（每台时）已达五码以上。根据目前的生产情形看来，今年第一季这些厂的纱、布产量都可以超过计划，大致接近去年第四季的水平，比去年同季将多生产七千多件纱，七百多万公尺布。国营毛纺厂、丝绸厂的产量也都可以超过计划。华达呢、哔叽、法兰绒、女色呢等春季衣料超过计划四万多公尺，粗细绒线比计划多生产近一万八千公斤，花巴黎、素软缎、留香绉、雁来红等丝质衣料，增产最多的超过计划百分之五十九。
    今年第一季中，上海国营纺织工厂的职工除努力试制新品种、创造新花样外，还注意采用代用品节约原料。如第九和第十二棉纺织厂学习苏联经验，用矽酸钠（水玻璃）作为浆料分解剂，降低棉布上浆率，每匹布的干面粉用量比普通浆要节省百分之三十九点三。这个方法在华东纺织工业管理局所属各厂推广后，一年可以节约面粉六万二千袋，同时可以节约油脂三十七万斤。这样，全局每年可以降低成本四十一亿五千万元左右。节约用棉的问题也引起各厂的注意。第四棉纺织厂去年全年平均每件纱用棉三百八十九斤，比一般厂少五斤半。第十六棉纺织厂的用棉量也比较低。华东纺织管理局技术处已吸收各厂经验，制订出节约用棉的技术措施。节约用棉、降低成本将成为上海纺织工业第二季的中心工作之一。
