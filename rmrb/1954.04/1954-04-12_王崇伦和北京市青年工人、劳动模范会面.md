Xinhua News Agency Report:

	Wang Chonglun, a nationally renowned young technical innovator, met with more than 4,000 young workers and model workers in Beijing's Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 11th, introducing his experience in continuously researching and improving technology and increasing labor productivity.
	When Wang Chonglun appeared on the stage, the entire venue erupted in applause. Many Youth League members, model workers, and advanced producers listened to the report while comparing Wang Chonglun's deeds to their own work. Kong Xiangyun, a hoist operator from the Steelmaking Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and a Youth League member, thought of his past research on improving the furnace top charging at the blast furnace when he heard that Wang Chonglun used broken bricks as models to study improved tools during his evening rest time. He felt that he did not have Wang Chonglun's spirit of overcoming difficulties. After Wang Chonglun's report, he told the propaganda committee member of the Youth League branch of his workshop who came with him: After returning to the factory, I will definitely continue to research and strive to successfully develop an automatic device for the furnace top charging.
	After Wang Chonglun's report, Wang Zhenlong, a lathe operator from the Beijing Automobile Parts Factory and a Youth League member who created a rolling cutter tool that increased efficiency more than tenfold by learning from Wang Chonglun, presented a rolling cutter he recently trial-produced to this person who is leading the way ahead of time, expressing his gratitude for the inspiration his deeds gave him. Following this, Liu Shimei, a national model worker in the textile industry and a young female worker from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, and Gong Caiyuan, a young labor model from the Xinhua Printing Factory, spoke on behalf of the city's young workers. They all expressed that they must continue to learn from Wang Chonglun's pioneering and innovative spirit, further improve labor productivity, and overfulfill this year's national production plan.
	Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, spoke at the meeting. He encouraged the young workers, saying that as long as they "make up their minds, defeat difficulties, think of all means, and learn modestly," they can transform from an ordinary worker into an advanced producer. He called on all young workers in Beijing to work hard to learn from Wang Chonglun, to train themselves to be people who are ahead of time, and to make greater contributions to the country's socialist construction.
	This meeting was jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

    王崇伦和北京市青年工人、劳动模范会面
    据新华社讯：全国闻名的青年技术革新者王崇伦十一日上午在首都中山公园和北京市四千多青年工人、劳动模范会面，介绍了他不断地研究改进技术，提高劳动生产率的经过。
    当王崇伦在讲台上出现时，全场掌声四起。许多青年团员、劳动模范和先进生产者一面听报告，一面就用王崇伦的事迹对照检查自己的工作。石景山钢铁厂炼铁部卷扬机司机、青年团员孔祥云当听到王崇伦在晚上休息时间用碎砖块当模型研究改进工具的时候，就想到自己过去研究改进高炉炉顶布料的事。他感到自己没有像王崇伦那样的克服困难的精神。在王崇伦报告后，他向同来的车间青年团总支宣教委员表示：回厂后一定继续研究，努力把炉顶布料的自动设备研究成功。
    在王崇伦报告后，因学习王崇伦而创造了滚刀工具提高效率十倍多的北京汽车配件厂镟工、青年团员汪振龙，把自己最近试制成功的一把滚刀送给了这位带头走在时间前面的人，表示感谢他的事迹对自己的鼓舞。接着，全国纺织工业劳动模范、清河制呢厂青年女工刘世梅和新华印刷厂青年劳动模范贡才元，代表全市青年工人讲话。他们都表示一定要继续学习王崇伦的首创革新精神，进一步提高劳动生产率，超额地完成今年的国家生产计划。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在会上讲了话。他勉励青年工人们说，只要能“下定决心，打倒困难，想尽办法，虚心学习”，就能由一个普通工人变为先进生产者。他号召北京市全体青年工人要努力学习王崇伦，把自己锻炼成为一个走在时间前面的人，给祖国社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    这次会见大会，是由青年团北京市委员会和北京市总工会联合举办的。
