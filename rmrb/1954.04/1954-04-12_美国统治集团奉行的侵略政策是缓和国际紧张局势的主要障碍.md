Soviet "Izvestia"

    Soviet "Izvestia" published an article by V. Kudryavtsev on the US aggression plan against Indochina. The article stated: The Geneva Conference, scheduled to be held on April 26, is charged with the task of restoring peace and national rights to the people of Indochina. Whether this task can be accomplished depends to a large extent on the attitude of France and the United States. The United States is intensifying its interference in the affairs of Indochina.

    Kudryavtsev wrote: The facts show that the US rulers are pursuing an aggressive policy and are trying every means to worsen the situation in Indochina, prolong the hostilities in Indochina, and even expand the war to other regions of Southeast Asia. This is evidenced by the fact that the United States increased its military assistance to the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina after the end of the Berlin Conference.

    Kudryavtsev continued: In the United States, "psychological" preparations have begun to facilitate the US's intensified military intervention in the Indochina war. Secretary of State Dulles is the one who is issuing orders. In his speech at the Overseas Press Club in New York on March 29, he called for "united action" against the people of Indochina. In effect, Dulles threatened to repeat the Korean adventure and carry out US armed intervention under the banner of the "United Nations." At the hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on April 5 regarding the new appropriations for the "Common Security Program," Dulles delivered a similarly hostile speech against the people of Indochina and the people of China. The US President expressed support for Dulles's proposals in a press conference speech and in a later radio address. Kudryavtsev continued: In order to "confirm" his war cries, Dulles adopted an argument he fabricated out of thin air: that the People's Republic of China was "interfering" in the Indochina war.

    The accusation against the People's Republic of China is false and fabricated, which is quite obvious, and the aggressive purpose of this accusation is so clear that even countries that have always supported the United States have rejected this statement.

    The United States is slandering the People's China, while it itself has long interfered in the Indochina war. It intends to use this war to realize its aggressive conspiracy against Asia, to suppress the struggle of the people of Indochina for freedom and national independence.

    Kudryavtsev pointed out: Dulles, who speaks for US monopoly capital, is a deadly enemy of all national liberation movements, because national liberation movements threaten the huge profits that the Rockefellers, Morgans, and Du Ponts derive from colonial plunder. The US ruling clique is leading all colonial countries against the struggle of the people of colonies and dependent countries for freedom and independence.

    The US's adventurous attempt to expand the Indochina war has caused unease among all countries concerned about a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

    Comments from foreign newspapers show that Dulles's remarks about possible "united action" in Indochina should be regarded as a call to expand the war against the people of Indochina. "United action" is just a sign to cover up the US's aggressive activities.

    These facts educate the people of all countries, making them aware that the aggressive policy of the US ruling clique is the main obstacle to establishing peace in Southeast Asia, thereby further easing international tensions.

North Korean "Rodong Sinmun"

    The editorial published by "Rodong Sinmun" on the 10th pointed out: The US ruling clique, fearing the solution of pressing Asian issues and the easing of international tensions, is trying every means to obstruct the Geneva Conference. The US ruling clique openly stated that if the Geneva Conference cannot "unify" Korea within ninety days according to Syngman Rhee's unreasonable demands, the representatives of the United States and Syngman Rhee will withdraw from the conference together. Under the command and encouragement of the United States, the Syngman Rhee gang has massively threatened to "march north." The US ruling clique is also continuing to create incidents that violate the armistice agreement, leaving the Korean armistice in an unstable state. At the same time, the US ruling clique is increasingly blatantly interfering in the war in Indochina. Recently, the United States conducted a hydrogen bomb explosion test in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean and large-scale military exercises on Iwo Jima and in South Korea. The purpose of these actions by the US ruling clique is to maintain and deepen international tensions, thereby hindering the Geneva Conference from achieving success. The editorial then pointed out: The Korean people and the people of the world must maintain a high degree of vigilance against these actions of the US ruling clique and strive for a peaceful resolution of pressing Asian issues at the Geneva Conference.

Hungarian "Free People's Newspaper"

    The Hungarian "Free People's Newspaper" published a short commentary on the 7th, condemning Dulles's remarks to the House Foreign Affairs Committee calling for expanded interference in the Indochina war.

    The newspaper said: Dulles's speech on April 5 leaves no doubt that the United States is accelerating the pace of its war policy before the Geneva Conference convenes, wanting to expand the war in Indochina. Dulles emphasized that there is "no reason to doubt" the "soundness" of the Navarre Plan. He also shouted that it is necessary to take so-called "united action," which means open American interference in the Indochina war. In order to find a reason for interfering in Indochina, Dulles said that "the Chinese have participated in" the Indochina war. However, the purpose of this "accusation" is nothing more than to decorate the actions of interfering in Indochina and "internationalizing" the Indochina war as appropriate in the eyes of the people of Indochina and the American people. However, this clearly exposes the US's attempt to disrupt the Geneva Conference and intensify international tensions.

US "Daily Worker"

    The US "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 6th, criticizing Dulles for attempting to turn the Indochina war into a second Korean War. The editorial pointed out, "The White House and Dulles know—and this is what annoys them the most—that the American public will no longer tolerate another Korean War today." They are trying to confront the American people with a big "deception" on the issue of the Indochina war.

    The editorial pointed out that the so-called "strategic need" for Indochina is a preposterous excuse by imperialists. "Indochina belongs to the people of Indochina, not to French banks, nor to Dulles and his Wall Street partners who seek profitable investments in cheap labor, oil, tin, and rubber."

    The editorial said that Dulles is conspiring to arrange another Korean War, so that "the munitions trusts can get many contracts to deal with the mountains of military waste that are now almost bursting the walls of the warehouses, and once again to intimidate the country, using McCarthy's persecution methods to deal with those who dare to ask for peace for the United States and its many families."

    The editorial concluded, "This plan to participate step by step in the aggression against Indochina is something that every American must now strongly protest. We should tell Washington: We don't want to be involved in this very undemocratic war anymore. We want a ceasefire there, as Vietnam has suggested. We hope that the Geneva Conference on April 26 will reach a ceasefire."

Indian "Free Press"

    The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on April 7, pointing out that just as Asia was hoping for the Geneva Conference to succeed, the United States was coercing its allies to issue a so-called "joint statement" of interference in the Indochina war. The purpose of this statement "is to undermine the Geneva Conference. They do this in an attempt to poison the atmosphere on the eve of the April 26 meeting." The editorial said: In recent days, Indian newspapers have expressed deep concern about a series of actions taken by the US government since the end of the Berlin Conference, because these actions seriously violate the wishes of all peace-loving people regarding the easing of international tensions.

"Hindustan Times"

    The Indian "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on April 9, saying: Dulles went to great lengths to explain the US's actions to interfere in Indochina. He said that the US's assistance to Indochina "is to help the legitimate government maintain itself." The editorial refuted this argument, saying: In the eyes of Asian public opinion, "The movement led by Dr. Ho Chi Minh is a true national revolution against French rule in Indochina, and US aid to France is no different from aiding French imperialism and binding the people with colonial chains."

### 美国统治集团奉行的侵略政策是缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍

    美国统治集团奉行的侵略政策是缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍
    苏联“消息报”
    苏联“消息报”刊载了弗·库德里雅夫采夫写的关于美国对印度支那的侵略计划的文章。文章说：将在四月二十六日举行的日内瓦会议负有恢复印度支那人民的和平与民族权利的任务。这任务能否完成，在很大程度上决定于法国与美国的态度。美国正在变本加厉地干涉印度支那的事务。
    库德里雅夫采夫写道：事实说明，美国的统治者奉行着侵略政策，正在想尽办法使得印度支那的形势恶化、延长印度支那的敌对行动，甚至把战争扩大到东南亚的其他地区去。美国在柏林会议结束以后就增加了给予印度支那法国远征军的军事援助，这一事实就证明了这一点。
    库德里雅夫采夫继续说：在美国已经开始了便于美国加紧对印度支那战争进行军事干涉的“心理”准备。发号施令的就是国务卿杜勒斯，他在三月二十九日在纽约海外记者俱乐部演说中，要求对印度支那人民采取“联合行动”。实际上是，杜勒斯威胁要重复朝鲜的冒险，在“联合国”的旗帜下进行美国的武装干涉。在四月五日众议院外交委员会讨论“共同安全计划”的新拨款时，杜勒斯发表了一篇同样的敌视印度支那人民与中国人民的演说。对于杜勒斯的建议，美国总统在一次记者招待会上发表的演说中，以及后来的广播演说中都表示支持。库德里雅夫采夫继续说：杜勒斯为了“证实”他的战争叫嚣，采用了一个他凭空捏造出来的中华人民共和国“干涉”印度支那战争的论点。
    对中华人民共和国的指责是虚假和捏造的，这一点十分明显，而这种指责的侵略目的也十分清楚，以致连一向支持美国的国家也唾弃这种说法。
    美国对人民中国进行诽谤，而它自己在很久以前就已经干涉了印度支那战争。它打算利用这个战争来实现它对亚洲的侵略阴谋，来镇压印度支那人民争取自由与民族独立的斗争。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出：代表美国垄断资本说话的杜勒斯是一切民族解放运动的死敌，因为民族解放运动威胁到洛克菲勒、摩根与杜邦之流依靠殖民掠夺所得到的巨额利润。美国统治集团正在领导所有殖民国家来反对殖民地与附属国人民争取自由与独立的斗争。
    美国想扩大印度支那战争的冒险企图已经引起了所有关心和平解决印度支那问题的国家的不安。
    外国报纸的评论说明：杜勒斯所发表的可能在印度支那采取“联合行动”的言论，应该被认为是扩大对印度支那人民的战争的叫嚣。“联合行动”不过是掩饰美国的侵略活动的一块招牌而已。
    这些事实教育了各国人民，使得他们知道了美国统治集团的侵略政策是建立东南亚和平从而使国际紧张局势进一步缓和的主要障碍。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    “劳动新闻”十日发表的社论指出：美国统治集团害怕亚洲迫切问题的解决和国际紧张局势的缓和，正在想尽办法来阻挠日内瓦会议。美国统治集团公开声称，如果日内瓦会议在九十天以内不能按照李承晚的无理要求“统一”朝鲜，美国和李承晚的代表将一起退出会议。在美国的指挥和鼓励下，李承晚匪帮大肆威胁要“向北进军”。美国统治集团还继续制造违反停战协定的事件，使朝鲜停战处于不稳定状态。同时，美国统治集团越来越露骨地干涉印度支那的战争。最近，美国又在太平洋的马绍尔群岛举行氢弹爆炸试验，在硫黄岛和南朝鲜举行大规模的军事演习。美国统治集团这些行动的目的，是要保持和加深国际紧张局势，借以阻挠日内瓦会议获得成就。社论接着指出：朝鲜人民和全世界人民对美国统治集团的这些行动要保持高度的警惕，努力争取在日内瓦会议上和平解决亚洲的迫切问题。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”
    匈牙利“自由人民报”七日发表短评，谴责杜勒斯在美国众议院外交委员会上叫嚣扩大干涉印度支那战争的言论。
    该报说：杜勒斯四月五日的讲话使人无可怀疑地认定，美国在日内瓦会议召开以前，正竭力加速推行它的战争政策的步调，要想扩大印度支那战争。杜勒斯强调：“没有理由怀疑”纳瓦尔计划的“健全”。他还叫喊，必须采取意味着美国人公开干涉印度支那战争的所谓“联合行动”。为了替干涉印度支那找寻理由，杜勒斯说什么“中国人参加了”印度支那战争。然而，这种“指责”的目的，不过是要在印度支那人民与美国人民面前，把干涉印度支那和使印度支那战争“国际化”的行动，装璜得仿佛是适当的。但是，这却使美国想捣乱日内瓦会议、想加剧国际紧张局势的企图清楚地暴露出来了。
    美国“工人日报”
    美国“工人日报”六日发表社论，斥责杜勒斯企图把印度支那战争变成第二个朝鲜战争。社论指出，“白宫与杜勒斯知道——这也正是使他们觉得最懊恼的地方——今天美国公众不会再容忍另一个朝鲜战争了。”他们正在企图使美国人民在印度支那战争问题上面临一个大“骗局”。
    社论指出，所谓对印度支那的“战略需要”的说法是帝国主义者狂妄的借口。“印度支那属于印度支那人民，不属于法国银行，也不属于杜勒斯与他的寻求廉价劳动力和石油、锡与橡胶方面的有利可图的投资的华尔街伙伴。”
    社论说，杜勒斯正阴谋安排另一次朝鲜战争，使“军火托辣斯得到许多合同，来打发现在都快把仓库的墙壁胀破了的、堆积如山的军用废物，再一次地来恐吓全国，以麦卡锡的迫害方法来对付那些敢为美国以及它的许多家庭要求和平的人。”
    社论最后说，“这种打算一步一步地参加对印度支那的侵略的做法正是每一个美国人现在必须强烈抗议的。我们应该告诉华盛顿说：我们不要再牵连到这个非常反民主的战争里去了。我们希望像越南所建议的那样在那里停火。我们希望四月二十六日日内瓦会议达成停战。”
      印度“自由报”
    印度“自由报”四月七日发表社论指出，正当亚洲盼望日内瓦会议获得成功的时候，美国却在胁迫它的盟国发表干涉印度支那战争的所谓“联合声明”。这个声明的目的“是要破坏日内瓦会议。他们这样做，是企图在四月二十六日会议召开前夕毒化气氛”。社论说：近几天来，印度报纸对美国政府在柏林会议结束以来的一系列的举动深表忧虑，因为这些举动严重地违反了所有爱好和平人民关于缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。
      “印度斯坦时报”
    印度“印度斯坦时报”四月九日发表社论说：杜勒斯费尽心机解释美国干涉印度支那的举动，他说，美国援助印度支那“是帮助合法的政府维持下去”，社论驳斥这个论点说：在亚洲舆论看来，“胡志明博士领导的运动是反对法国统治印度支那的真正的民族革命，而美国援助法国是与援助法国帝国主义和用殖民锁链来束缚人民没有什么差别的”。
