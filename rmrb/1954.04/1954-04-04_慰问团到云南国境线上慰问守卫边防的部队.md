Xinhua News Agency Report:

    On March 25th, the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army arrived on the border south of the Honghe River in Yunnan Province to慰问 the border defense troops. The border guards stationed on the border line, filled with great joy, erected arches and set up many reception stations along the 160-li mountain post road to welcome their loved ones. Many Dai, Yi, and Hani youths and elders from remote villages also gathered in groups to welcome the representatives sent by Chairman Mao along with the border defense troops. The delegation held a慰问 conference on March 26th, at which Qi Wei, deputy head of the First General Sub-Delegation (Volunteer Army), extended cordial慰问 to the soldiers stationed on the border. Zhu Youlin, head of a certain unit, spoke on behalf of the border defense troops, thanking Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for their concern, and expressed their determination to live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland and to guard the socialist construction of the motherland with hundredfold vigilance. The delegation representatives organized a symposium for heroes and model workers in the border areas, and visited various companies and local residents in the continuous fog and rain for days. The representatives also visited three Hani families of volunteer soldiers. The art troupe of the delegation also worked tirelessly to perform慰问 shows for the soldiers in every company.
    On March 29th, the delegation comforted the famous "Red Seventh Company" of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the border south of the Honghe River in Yunnan. The "Red Seventh Company" is a heroic company that was born in Jinggangshan in 1927. It participated in the Long March and in the establishment of the Taiyue and Zhongtiao Mountain Anti-Japanese Democratic Base Areas. During the Liberation War, it also participated in the famous Huaihai and Crossing-the-Yangtze campaigns. After the liberation of the mainland, they have been undertaking the sacred task of defending the motherland's border. On March 29th, Tian Han, a representative of the delegation and a playwright, and Xu Dehua, a second-class meritorious volunteer soldier, arrived at the "Red Seventh Company" to convey Chairman Mao's and the people of the whole country's concern and慰问. Zhang Hongli, the political instructor of the "Red Seventh Company," read aloud to the representatives the letter written to Chairman Mao by the entire company, and led the soldiers to swear to the representatives: We will resolutely defend the security of the motherland and defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    据新华社讯：三月二十五日，全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到达云南省红河以南的国境线上，慰问边防部队。驻守在国境线上的边防战士怀着极大的喜悦，在长达一百六十里的山间驿路上扎起牌坊，设置了许多招待站，迎接亲人。许多偏远村寨的傣族、彝族和哈尼族的男女青年和老人也成群结队地赶来和边防部队一道欢迎毛主席派来的代表。慰问团在三月二十六日举行了慰问大会，会上第一总分团（志愿军）副团长齐威向驻守边疆的战士致亲切的慰问。某部首长朱尤林代表边防部队答谢毛主席和全国人民的关怀，表示决不辜负祖国人民的期望，要百倍警惕地保卫祖国的社会主义的建设。慰问团代表在边疆组织了英雄模范座谈会，并连日在不断的雾雨中翻山涉水，向各个连队与当地居民进行了慰问。代表们还慰问了三位哈尼族的志愿军家族。慰问团的文艺工作团也不辞劳苦地到每一个班里向战士们作慰问演出。
    三月二十九日，慰问团慰问了驻守在云南边疆红河以南国境线上的人民解放军某部著名的“红七连”。“红七连”是一九二七年诞生在井冈山上的一支英雄连队，曾经参加过长征，参加过建立太岳、中条山抗日民主根据地，在解放战争中又参加了名震中外的淮海和渡江战役。全国大陆解放后，他们又一直担负了保卫祖国边疆的神圣任务。三月二十九日，慰问团代表、戏剧家田汉和志愿军二等功臣徐德华到了“红七连”，传达了毛主席和全国人民的关怀和慰问。“红七连”的政治指导员张洪礼在代表们面前朗读了全连写给毛主席的信，并带领战士们向代表们宣誓：坚决保卫祖国的安全，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
