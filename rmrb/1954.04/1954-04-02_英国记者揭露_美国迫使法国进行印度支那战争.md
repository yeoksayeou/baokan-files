    British Journalist Reveals
    The United States Forced France to Wage the Indochina War
    [Xinhua News Agency] British journalist Green, who recently visited Indochina, wrote in the "Sunday Times" that there are now far more Americans in Indochina than in 1951 and 1952. Green said: "Obviously, they are there to protect their investments. ... I once expressed my opinion to a representative of the American economic delegation: France's participation in this war may be nearing its end. He replied: No, they can't do that, if they do, they have to pay us back the money. He said the amount was about several billion dollars."

    英国记者揭露
    美国迫使法国进行印度支那战争
    【新华社讯】不久以前到过印度支那的英国记者格林在“星期日泰晤士报”上写道，现在在印度支那的美国人要比一九五一年和一九五二年多得多了。格林说：“显然，他们在那儿是为了保护自己的投资。……我曾经对美国经济代表团的一个代表表示过我的看法：法国人参加这个战争可能接近尾声了。他回答说：不然，他们不能那样干，他们如果那样干的话，就得还我们的钱。他说这笔款子约有数十亿美元。”
