At present, all counties have opened one to two training courses in succession. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-eight counties including Changji, Kuche, Yutian, Yanqi, and Huocheng, more than 2,200 mutual aid team leaders have been trained.
    After studying, the trainees' policy level and leadership ability have been greatly improved, strengthening their confidence in consolidating and improving mutual aid teams.
    Now, the mutual aid team leader training courses in various places have ended one after another. A large number of mutual aid team leaders who have completed their studies have returned to their respective townships. Under the leadership of cadres, they are combining spring plowing production to rectify and develop mutual aid teams, and vigorously carry out the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    新疆省培养了大批互助组的领导骨干
    新疆省各地从去年冬季起，在党委的领导下，开办了互助组长等训练班，吸收共产党和青年团农村支部书记、委员，党、团员，区、乡、村干部，临时、常年互助组长，劳动模范，互助组积极分子等进行学习。目前各县都已先后开办了一期到两期训练班。据昌吉、库车、于阗、焉耆、霍城等二十八个县的不完全统计，已训练了两千二百多名互助组领导骨干。
    经过学习，学员们的政策水平和领导能力有了很大提高，加强了巩固和提高互助组的信心。
    现在各地互助组长训练班都已先后结束。经过学习的大批互助组领导骨干，已返回各乡，在干部的领导下，结合春耕生产整顿和发展互助组，大力开展农业生产互助合作运动。
