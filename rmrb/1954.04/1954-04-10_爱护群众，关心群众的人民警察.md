People's Police Who Love and Care for the Masses

Rescuing an Old Man from an Ice Hole

On the afternoon of December 13th last year, Lü Chongzhang, a household registration police officer and member of the Communist Youth League from the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, was investigating household registrations in Dongyuzhuang when he suddenly saw a large group of people running eastward in a panic. Thinking something must have happened, he quickly followed the crowd.

The crowd ran to the edge of a large water pit, where a group of people was already gathered, anxiously watching and shouting, interspersed with hoarse cries for help. Lü Chongzhang squeezed through the crowd and saw an old man trapped in the middle of the pit, which was covered with a thin layer of ice. He was clutching the edge of the ice with both hands, the icy water already up to his neck, and he looked like he was about to sink to the bottom. People on the bank were anxiously stomping their feet and shouting, "The water is so deep, and the ice isn't strong enough, how can we save him?"

It turned out that the old man was Zhao Yushan, who lived in the Shizi Hutong of Dongyuzhuang. That afternoon, he was passing by the large water pit and wanted to take a shortcut across the ice. Unexpectedly, the ice was too thin, and he fell through with a "plop" as soon as he reached the middle. The elderly man, both frozen and frightened, was trembling with both hands, and his face had turned pale. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't climb out.

Lü Chongzhang was also very anxious when he saw this situation and wanted to rush to the ice hole to save the old man immediately; but he also considered that the ice was so thin that he might fall in himself before he could reach him. But if he didn't go, the old man's life would be in danger. Could a people's police officer, a member of the Communist Youth League, stand by and watch the people drown? Thinking of this, he resolutely walked towards the ice hole.

He had only taken a few steps when the ice began to crack loudly. The people on the shore shouted in surprise, "Don't go! You'll fall in too!" But Lü Chongzhang seemed not to hear and continued to walk forward step by step. As he approached the ice hole, the ice could no longer support him, and suddenly a large chunk collapsed with a "crunch." He quickly rolled to the side on the ice, but it was too late, and he fell into the ice hole with a "plop."

At this critical moment, fortunately, Lü Chongzhang quickly grabbed the rope and wooden sticks thrown down by the people on the bank and did not sink to the bottom. He grabbed the rope and climbed onto the ice. Although his whole body was soaked with ice water and he was shivering with cold, he immediately handed the wooden stick to the old man because the old man was still in danger. But the old man's hands were frozen stiff and he couldn't grasp the wooden stick for a long time. "Climb forward, closer to the old man!" Lü Chongzhang ordered himself. But at this time, the danger of the ice collapsing was even greater, and there was a constant "crack, crack" sound all around. Lü Chongzhang couldn't stand up, so he continued to crawl towards the old man. His selfless and courageous actions deeply moved the people on the shore. A citizen named Guo San also crawled across the ice to help him rescue the old man.

When Lü Chongzhang was pulled ashore by the people on the bank, although his whole body was shivering with cold and his arms were cut by the ice, he smiled when he saw the people helping the old man home. Some of the people around him hurriedly took off their clothes, and some took off their shoes, asking him to change out of his wet clothes and shoes. Everyone said, "The people's police really serve the people!" Soon, the rescued old man recovered his health and personally went to the police station to visit Lü Chongzhang. He held Lü Chongzhang's hand and said gratefully, "If it weren't for you saving me, my old life would have been over."

Lü Chongzhang's heroic act of saving others at his own expense became a force driving other people's police to serve the people. At the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau's commendation and celebration meeting held not long ago, he won the honorary title of first-class meritorious police officer.

"You Saved My Child's Life!"

One night in 1953, a strong wind was blowing. Wang Yiru, a police officer from the Sipailou Police Station in Nanjing City, was suffering from a severe cold, headache, and high fever. He had not eaten dinner and was lying in bed.

It was 11 o'clock at night, and people had already gone to bed. The on-duty police officer, Li Zhongyuan, suddenly shouted, "There's a fire at Da Shi Qiao!" When Wang Yiru heard the shout, he struggled to get out of bed, but his head was spinning, and his legs were weak, so he had to sit down again. At this time, he thought, "The Da Shi Qiao area is a shantytown. With such a strong wind tonight and such dry weather, how dangerous it would be if a fire broke out! The people's police must protect the safety of the people's lives and property, and we must hurry. One more person going, arriving one minute earlier, will be beneficial to extinguishing the fire." So he gritted his teeth and stood up, rushing to the fire scene.

When Wang Yiru ran to the fire scene, he had just picked up a bucket to put out the fire when he suddenly heard a woman crying loudly, "The child is still inside the house, please save him! Please save him!" He immediately dropped the bucket and rushed into the house, which was filled with thick smoke and raging fire. He couldn't see anything inside. The thick smoke choked him, making it difficult to breathe, and the strong firelight made it impossible to open his eyes. He could only hear the faint crying of the child. He lunged in the direction of the child's cries and finally rescued the child. Just as he handed the child over to the crying mother, he saw an old man in his seventies next to him, his clothes soaked, his face covered in mud, and shivering with cold. Wang Yiru immediately helped the old man to a nearby resident's home, drew a basin of hot water for him to wash his face, and took off his own clothes for him to put on. The old man said with tears in his eyes, "Only the People's Government led by the Communist Party has such good people!"

It was already past 1:00 a.m. when Wang Yiru settled the old man. The fire had been extinguished. To prevent any further accidents in the fire area, he took some enthusiastic activists from the masses to inspect the fire scene. At this time, the masses realized that his face was pale, and there was a hole burned in his hat. The masses were deeply moved when they learned that he was ill and insisted that he go back to rest, promising to do a good job of inspecting the fire scene. Due to the repeated urging of the masses, he returned to the police station. The next day, his illness worsened. The mother of the rescued child specially ran to see him and said gratefully, "You saved my child's life!" After several days of treatment, Wang Yiru recovered his health. Because of his love for the people, his concern for the safety of the masses' lives, and his loyalty to the people's police work, he was deeply loved by the masses, so he won the honorary title of first-class meritorious police officer at the recent Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau's commendation meeting.

"The Public Security Officer Saved Two Lives in My Family!"

Zhang Peifu, a public security officer of the Chengguan District People's Government in Guangling County, Shanxi Province, is a Communist Party member and a demobilized soldier. Last November, he went to Shahe Village to work on grain unified purchase and lived in the courtyard of a villager named Liu Bingheng. At 2:00 a.m. on the 18th, he was awakened by the noisy sounds outside. Mixed with the voices of the people was Liu Bingheng's shouting, "Help! Help!" The dog was also barking madly. Zhang Peifu immediately got up, put on his clothes, and ran outside. Because he ran out of the house too quickly, he didn't pay attention and was bitten in the leg by the dog barking madly next to the door. But he couldn't care about the pain and ran in one breath to the side of a well surrounded by people. People were watching the well, some were calling for help, and some were sighing. After a while, Liu Bingheng慌慌张张地搬来一个梯子. But the ladder was too short to reach the well, which was more than three zhang deep. Liu Bingheng cried in despair. At this time, Zhang Peifu already knew that someone from Liu Bingheng's family had fallen into the well. He didn't have time to say much to people, so he squeezed to the wellhead, took off his shoes and socks, ignored the wound on his leg, and mustered his strength to step on the not-very-firm stone crevices in the well ring, and went down step by step. The icy cold water stung his feet, and he was shivering with cold all over. He gritted his teeth and went down until he was next to the well water, his feet firmly planted, and then he groped with his hands, and immediately touched a woman's hair. Zhang Peifu was afraid that she would drink more water, so he grabbed her hair and lifted her upper body. At this time, the people above dropped the rope, and Zhang Peifu quickly tied it around her waist, and the people above immediately pulled her up. But when she was rescued, she had already lost consciousness. Zhang Peifu immediately ran to the county hospital to ask for a doctor to perform emergency treatment, and she gradually woke up. People saw Zhang Peifu risking his life to go down the well to save people, and after coming up, he wore wet clothes, ignoring the pain of the wound on his leg, and ran to the county to find a doctor, and they were all moved and said, "Comrade Zhang is really our good public security cadre!"

It turned out that the rescued woman was Liu Bingheng's wife, who was four months pregnant. Liu Bingheng said gratefully, "The public security officer saved two lives in my family!" The next day, the news of Zhang Peifu going down the well to save people spread throughout Shahe Village, and people came in groups to visit him at Liu Bingheng's home.

    爱护群众，关心群众的人民警察
    从冰窟窿里救出老大爷
    去年十二月十三日下午，天津市公安局户籍民警、青年团员吕崇章正在东于庄调查户口，忽然看见一大群人慌慌张张地往东跑。他想一定是出了什么事，就随着人群很快地跑去。
    大家跑到一个大水坑边，那里早围了一群人，都在焦急地望着、喊叫着，中间还夹杂着嘶哑的呼救声。吕崇章急忙从人缝里钻进去，看见结着薄冰的坑中间陷着一个老人。他两只手紧抓着薄冰的边缘，冰水已淹到他的脖颈，眼看就要沉下水底。坑边上的人们都急得跺着脚嚷：“水这么深，冰又不结实，可怎么去救他呢？”
    原来这个老大爷叫赵玉山，在东于庄十字胡同居住。这天下午，他经过大水坑时，想抄近路从冰面上走过去。不料冰层太薄，他刚走到中间，便扑通一声陷下去了。上了年纪的人连冻带吓，两手直哆嗦，脸色都发青了，无论怎样也爬不上来。
    吕崇章看了这情景，也很着急，想马上跑到冰窟窿旁去救这个老人；但又考虑到冰这么薄，恐怕走不到那儿自己也要陷下去。要不去救呢，眼看这个老人就有生命危险，难道一个人民警察、青年团员能看着老百姓被淹死而袖手旁观吗？他想到这里，就坚决向冰窟窿走去。
    他刚走了几步，冰就“嘎叭”、“嘎叭”地直响。岸上的人们都吃惊地大声喊：“别走啦，你也要陷下去了！”但吕崇章就像没有听见一样，仍然一步一步地向前走去。当他快走近冰窟窿的时候，冰再也支撑不住了，突然“嘎吱”一声又塌下去了一大块。他急忙顺势向旁边冰上一滚，但已经来不及了，“扑通”一声也陷进了冰窟窿。
    在这万分紧急的时候，幸好吕崇章很快地抓住了坑边上人们抛下来的绳子和木棍，没有沉底。他抓住绳子爬到了冰面上。虽然冰水湿透了全身，冷得刺骨；但因老人还没有脱险，他立刻把木棍递给老大爷。可是老人的手冻僵了，半天也抓不住木棍。“再往前爬，离老大爷更近些！”吕崇章命令着自己。但这时冰面塌陷的危险更大了，四周一个劲的
  “嘎叭”、“嘎叭”地响，吕崇章不能站起来，就继续向老大爷爬去。他的这种奋不顾身的英勇行动，深深地感动了岸上的人们，有个叫郭三的市民，也从冰上爬了过去，帮助他把这个老人救上来了。
    吕崇章同志被坑边上的人们拉上岸时，虽然全身冻得发抖，手臂也被冰凌割破了，但他看着人们把老大爷扶回家去了，脸上露出了笑容。周围的人们，有的赶忙脱下自己的衣服，有的脱下自己的鞋子，要他换下湿的衣服和鞋子。大家都说：“人民警察真是给人民办事的！”不久，这个被救的老大爷恢复了健康，亲自到派出所去看望吕崇章，他拉着吕崇章的手感激地说：“要不是你搭救我，我这一条老命就完了。”
    吕崇章同志的这种舍己救人的英勇行为，成了推动其他人民警察为人民服务的力量。在前不久天津市人民政府公安局举行的表扬模范和庆功大会上，他荣获了一等功民警的光荣称号。
    “孩子的命是你救活的！”
    一九五三年的一个夜晚，刮着大风。南京市四牌楼派出所的民警王宜儒正患着重伤风，头痛，发高热，晚饭也没有吃，就躺在床上了。
    深夜十一时了，人们都已安歇。值班民警李仲源突然大喊：“大石桥失火了！”王宜儒听到喊声，就从床上挣扎着爬起来，但头直发晕，两腿直发酸，只得又坐下来。这时，他想：“大石桥一带是棚户区，今晚风这样大，天气这样干燥，火烧起来该多么危险！人民警察要保卫人民生命财产安全，要赶快去。多去一个人，早到一分钟，对消灭火灾都是有利的。”于是他咬着牙站起来，向火场奔去。
    王宜儒跑到火场，刚拿起水桶要去救火，忽然听到一个妇女大声哭喊：“小孩还在屋里，快去救命啊！快去救命啊！”他立刻丢掉水桶，冲进吐着浓烟烈火的屋子里。里面什么也看不见，浓烟呛得他呼吸困难，强烈的火光耀得睁不开眼，只能听到微弱的小孩的哭声。他朝着小孩哭的方向扑去，终于把小孩救了出来。刚把孩子交给了哭喊着的妈妈，他又看到旁边一个七十多岁的老大爷衣服湿淋淋的，满脸污泥，冻得直发抖。王宜儒马上又把老大爷扶到附近的居民家里，打了一盆热水给他洗脸，把自己的衣服脱下来给他穿上。老大爷流着眼泪说：“只有共产党领导的人民政府，才有这样的好人！”
    王宜儒把老大爷安置好，已是深夜一时多了，火已经救灭。为了火灾区不再发生意外，他又带着一些群众积极分子去检查火场。这时群众才发觉他的脸色发白，帽子上烧了一个洞。群众知道他正在害病后，都深受感动，一致要他回去休息，并提出保证：一定做好火场检查工作。由于群众一再催促，他才回到了派出所。第二天，他的病重了。被救孩子的母亲特地跑去看他，很感激地说：“孩子的命是你救活的！”经过几天的治疗，王宜儒才恢复了健康。由于他热爱人民，关心群众的生命安全，忠诚于人民警察工作，深得群众爱戴，所以他在最近南京市人民政府公安局召开的功臣模范大会上荣获了一等功民警的光荣称号。　（葛涤）
    “公安员救活了我家两条命！”
    山西省广灵县城关区人民政府公安员张培福是共产党员、复员转业军人。去年十一月，他到沙河村搞粮食统购工作，住在老乡刘炳恒的院里。十八日深夜两点钟的时候，他被外面的嘈杂声音吵醒了，人声里混杂着刘炳恒的喊叫声：“快救人啊！快救人啊！”狗也狂吠着。张培福马上起来，披上衣服往外面跑。因为出屋门时跑得太急，没有注意，被正在门旁狂吠的狗咬破了腿。但他也顾不得疼痛，一口气就跑到被人群围着的一口井的旁边。人们注视着井里，有的在呼救，有的在叹息。不一会，刘炳恒慌慌张张地搬来一个梯子。但梯子太短，够不着三丈多深的井。刘炳恒绝望地哭了。这时，张培福已经知道是刘炳恒家的人掉进井里去了。他来不及和人多说，就挤到井口，脱下鞋袜，不顾腿上的伤口，鼓足气力踏着井圈内不很牢固的石头缝，一步一步地下去。冰冷的水刺痛脚掌，冷得浑身直打战。他咬紧了牙，一直下到挨着井水的地方，脚踩稳了，就用手去摸索，一下摸到一个女人的头发。张培福怕她再喝水，就抓紧头发，把她的上半身提起。这时，井上的人们丢下了绳子，张培福赶紧用绳缚住了她的腰部，上面的人立即把她拉了上去。但她被救上来时已经失去知觉，张培福又立即跑到县医院请来医生，进行急救，她才逐渐苏醒过来。人们眼见张培福冒着生命危险下井救人，上来后又穿着湿衣服，不顾腿上伤口的疼痛，跑到县里找医生，都感动地说：“张同志真是咱们的好公安干部啊！”
    原来，这个被救的妇女是刘炳恒的妻子，已怀孕四个月。刘炳恒感激地说：“公安员救了我家两条命！”第二天，张培福下井救人的事传遍了沙河村，人们都成群集伙地到刘炳恒家来看望他。
