The Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Government Delegation of the Republic of India, from December 31, 1953 to April 29, 1954, conducted negotiations on the relationship between China and India in the Tibet region of China in an atmosphere of harmony and understanding, and have now successfully concluded. Today, we signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India" and exchanged notes.

The above-mentioned agreement and exchanged notes between China and India were reached through full consultation under the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Therefore, they are in the interests of the people of both countries. At the same time, both sides held the sincerity of friendly consultation during the negotiations, which fully demonstrates the friendly relations between China and India. The signing of this agreement has laid a new foundation for the relations between the two countries in the Tibet region of China. On this new foundation, we believe that the trade relations and cultural exchanges between the Tibet region of China and India will be further developed, and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries will deepen day by day.

At the same time, the success of this Sino-Indian negotiation once again proves that as long as all countries jointly abide by the above-mentioned principles and adopt the method of consultation, any existing problems between countries can be reasonably resolved.

China and India are two large countries in Asia bordering each other. The people of China and India are peace-loving people, and the unity of the people of China and India is of great significance for consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

Let the people of our two countries unite more closely and make greater efforts for the cause of peace!

Gentlemen of the Indian delegation, first of all, the spirit of cooperation of Ambassador R.K. Nehru, the head of the delegation, enabled this negotiation to reach an agreement smoothly. I myself and on behalf of the Chinese delegation express my heartfelt thanks to them.

Ambassador and gentlemen of the Indian delegation, please allow me to warmly congratulate the achievement of this negotiation and the signing of this agreement here.
