"Reinforcements"? Or "Casualties"?
	Wu Fei

On the eve of the Geneva Conference, French warmongers continue to send batches of French youth to the "dirty" war of aggression against Indochina. This is the American strategy: France provides the manpower, and the United States provides the money, to block the road to restoring peace in Indochina.

On April 17th, in order to fill the huge losses suffered by the French army at Dien Bien Phu, the French authorities rushed a battalion of paratroopers from the country to Indochina and airdropped them into Dien Bien Phu, which was besieged by the Vietnamese People's Army.

However, according to a report by the Associated Press, some of these "paratroopers" had not received any parachute training at all. Therefore, when parachuting down, "some people fell into barbed wire and other obstacles and broke their legs," and some "sprained or broke their ankles," and "these people have arrived at the already overcrowded underground hospital." The Associated Press also quoted a French official in Hanoi, in what was either an attempt at self-deprecation or self-praise: "It is the first time in the history of the French army that any number of people without parachuting experience have jumped in a combat parachute jump."

As everyone knows, it is by no means the first time that the French aggressor troops trapped in Dien Bien Phu have been severely attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army. The American and French news agencies have also had to admit that the French army has suffered heavy losses, and the number of casualties has soared, "The underground hospital in Dien Bien Phu is already full of wounded."

Therefore, the French authorities could not wait to airdrop another battalion of "reinforcements" to Dien Bien Phu, but as soon as the "reinforcements" fell from the air to the ground, some of them became "casualties."

This is a small "tragedy." This tragedy vividly shows that the French warmongers still disregard the national interests of France and the expectations of French mothers and wives, and still disregard the calls of people of all countries for the restoration of peace in Indochina, using the lives of French youth to serve the American strategy. People cannot help but ask, what price can this kind of "service" bring to France?

There is only one answer: It loses both "sovereignty" and "soldiers"!

### “援兵”？还是“伤兵”？

    “援兵”？还是“伤兵”？
    吴非
    日内瓦会议的前夕，法国好战分子继续把法国青年一批一批地投到侵略印度支那这个“肮脏”的战争中去。这就是美国的战略：法国出人，美国出钱，来堵死恢复印度支那和平的道路。
    四月十七日，为了填补法军在奠边府遭到的惨重损失，法国当局又从国内把伞兵一营赶运到印度支那并空降到被越南人民军围困的奠边府。
    但是，据合众社报道，原来这批“伞兵”中有一些根本没有受过跳伞训练。因此，当跳伞降落时，“有些人落在铁丝网和其他障碍物中跌断了腿”，有些人“扭伤或折断了脚踝”，“这些人已到了已经拥挤不堪的地下医院”。合众社并引用了河内法国官员的不知是解嘲还是自夸的话：“在一次作战跳伞中有任何数目的没有跳伞经验的人跳下来，在法国陆军的历史上还是第一次。”
    大家知道，困守奠边府的法国侵略军遭到越南人民军的痛击却早已不是第一次，美、法通讯社也不得不承认，法军损失惨重，伤亡人数激增，“奠边府地下医院中已挤满了伤员”。
    因此，法国当局才迫不及待地向奠边府再空投一营“援兵”，但是，“援兵”刚从空中落到地下，就有一部分变成“伤兵”了。
    这是一出小小的“悲剧”。这出悲剧生动地表明：法国的好战分子仍然不顾法国的民族利益和法国母亲、妻子的期望，仍然不顾各国人民要求恢复印度支那和平的呼声，拿着法国青年的生命去为美国的战略效劳。人们不禁要问，这种“效劳”能给法国带来什么代价呢？
    答案只有一个：赔了“主权”又“折兵”！
