    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow, TASS reports: The Soviet people warmly welcome the decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to further reduce state retail prices for food and manufactured goods. After the radio broadcast the news of the price reduction, meetings were held in factories, government offices, and collective farms to discuss the decision.

    In Moscow, Potapov, a foreman at the Ilyich factory, said at a factory meeting: The decision to reduce prices once again shows that our country is becoming richer and stronger year by year, and our lives are getting better and better. All the measures taken by our country are aimed at improving the cultural and material well-being of the people. Gorshkov, a foreman at the "Dynamo" factory, said: The Soviet people are the creators of their own happiness. The more we produce, the stronger our country becomes, and the richer our lives will be. Kholina, a female worker at the Red Rose Silk Weaving Factory, said: I am very happy that the price of silk fabrics has been reduced, which will make our beautiful silks more marketable, and Soviet women will be able to dress even more beautifully. In Leningrad, Kozlovsky, a worker at the Nevsky Machine Factory, said: The governments of capitalist countries are concerned with stepping up the arms race, increasing taxes, and raising the prices of daily necessities. Our Soviet country is concerned with raising the living standards of the people. Voltanov, a fitter at the Ordzhonikidze Machine Building Plant in Tbilisi, said at a workers' meeting: My family is getting richer year by year. Thanks to successive price reductions since 1947, we can now buy more than two rubles worth of food and industrial products for one ruble.

    Soviet collective farmers warmly welcome the decision to reduce prices again. Kuzmenkov, a member of the "Red Dawn" collective farm in the Smolensk region, said: The further reduction of prices shows that the task set by the Party and the government to improve the material well-being of the people is being implemented.

    [Xinhua News Agency, April 2] TASS reports: The decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to reduce state retail prices for food and manufactured goods for the seventh time since the war will give the Soviet people at least 20 billion rubles in direct benefits from state-owned and cooperative trading systems in one year. The benefits derived from the reduction of prices in collective farm markets are not included. The net benefit to the Soviet people from the previous six price reductions is more than 380 billion rubles. In the past four years, due to the reduction of state retail prices, the wages of Soviet workers and staff and the income of collective farmers have increased by 60 percent.

    The systematic reduction of prices shows the Soviet government's constant concern for increasing the people's income. In addition to reducing prices, the Soviet people can also receive various allowances and subsidies from the employee social insurance fund, pensions from the social security fund, and can also enter sanatoriums, rest homes and other welfare institutions free of charge or at low cost, as well as free medical care, free vocational and professional training, and scholarship benefits. Last year, the Soviet people received 195 billion rubles in benefits from the state budget, which was 48 billion rubles more than in 1952. All these benefits have greatly increased the actual income of the working people.

    The increase in the purchasing power of the Soviet working people has expanded the sales of daily necessities, and Soviet trade has continued to develop. Last year, the Soviet people bought 21 percent more goods than in 1952. In 1940, the sales of daily necessities accounted for 36.9 percent of the total sales, and in 1953 this proportion increased to 45.3 percent. Among them, silk fabrics increased by 45 percent, leather shoes increased by 29 percent, clocks and watches increased by 38 percent, radios increased by 32 percent, and motorcycles increased by 55 percent. This year, the national trading system will sell twice as many goods as in 1940. In the first three months of this year, the Soviet Union has opened approximately 2,500 new stores, and more than 8,000 stores will be opened by the beginning of next year. The distribution network of collective farm markets in cities is also developing. In the next two years, 500 new collective farm markets will be built. The Soviet trade staff will complete the tasks stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule this year.

    苏联人民热烈欢迎再次减低物价
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民热烈欢迎苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于再次减低食品和制成品国家零售价格的决定。当电台广播了减低物价的消息后，各地的工厂、机关和集体农庄中纷纷举行集会，讨论这个决定。
    在莫斯科，伊里奇工厂领班波塔波夫在工厂举行的集会上说：再一次减低物价的决定，表明了我们的国家一年比一年富强，我们的生活越来越美好。我们国家所采取的一切措施的目的都是增进人民的文化和物质福利。“狄纳莫”工厂的领班戈尔什科夫说：苏联人民是自己的幸福的创造者，我们生产的东西愈多，我们的国家愈强大，我们的生活就愈富裕。红玫瑰丝织厂的女工霍里娜说：我很高兴丝织品的价格减低，这将使我们织出来的美丽的丝绸的销路更大了，苏联妇女将穿得更漂亮了。在列宁格勒，湼夫斯基机器工厂的工人科兹洛夫斯基说：资本主义国家的政府所关心的是加紧扩军备战、增加税收、提高日用品的价格。而我们苏维埃国家所关心的是提高人民的生活水平。第比利斯奥尔忠尼启则机器制造厂的钳工沃尔坦诺夫在工人大会上说：我的家庭一年比一年富裕。由于一九四七年以来历次减低物价，我们今天能用一个卢布买到两个卢布以上的食品和工业品。
    苏联集体农民热烈欢迎关于再次减低物价的决定。斯摩棱斯克州“红色曙光”集体农庄庄员库兹缅科夫说：再次减低物价说明：党和政府所规定的增进人民物质福利的任务正在执行中。
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会颁布的战后第七次减低食品和制成品的国家零售价格的决定，将使苏联人民在一年内从国营和合作社贸易系统中得到至少二百亿卢布的直接利益，由集体农庄市场的价格减低而得到的利益还不计算在内。苏联人民在过去六次减低物价中净得的利益在三千八百亿卢布以上。在过去四年中，由于国家零售价格的降低，苏联工人、职员的工资和集体农民的收入共增加了百分之六十。
    有系统地减低物价说明了苏联政府对于提高人民收入的不断关怀。除了减低物价以外，苏联人民还可从职工社会保险基金项下领取各种津贴和补助费，从社会赡养基金中领取养老金，还可以免费或低费进疗养院、休养所及其他福利机关，还有免费医疗、免费受职业和专业训练，以及奖学金等利益。去年苏联人民从国家预算中得到的利益达一千九百五十亿卢布，即比一九五二年得到的利益多四百八十亿卢布。这一切利益使劳动人民的实际收入大大增加了。
    苏联劳动人民购买力的提高，使日用品销售量扩大，苏维埃贸易不断发展。去年苏联人民购买的货物比一九五二年多百分之二十一。一九四零年苏联日用品销售额占销售总额的百分之三十六点九，一九五三年这个比例增加到百分之四十五点三。其中丝织品增加了百分之四十五，皮鞋增加了百分之二十九，钟表增加了百分之三十八，无线电收音机增加了百分之三十二，机器脚踏车增加了百分之五十五。今年国家贸易系统将销售比一九四零年多一倍的货物。在今年头三个月中，苏联已开设了约二千五百个新商店，到明年年初还将开设八千多个商店。城市中的集体农庄市场的分布网也正在发展。在今后两年中，新建的集体农庄市场将达五百个。苏联的贸易工作人员将在今年提前完成第五个五年计划（一九五一——一九五五年）所规定的任务。
