    中共重庆市委扩大会议讨论四中全会文件
    【本报重庆十二日电】中共重庆市委会从三月三十日到四月三日召开了扩大会议，讨论七届四中全会的文件。出席会议的有市委委员和相当于地委书记以上干部四十七人。会议依照中共中央西南局第十二次扩大会议传达七届四中全会决议精神，进行了认真的讨论。会议一致认为：重庆市党的组织的情况，正如中央指出的，基本上是团结一致的，这种团结是建立在党中央和毛主席正确的政治路线和组织路线的基础上的，因而在中共中央西南局的直接领导下，在重庆解放以来的各项工作中能获得一定的成绩。到会同志还对个人的工作、思想作了检查。不少同志检查了自己的骄傲自满情绪、分散主义、本位主义、自由主义。他们都认识到这些都是不利于党的团结的资产阶级的个人主义思想。通过学习四中全会决议，到会同志的政治觉悟进一步提高，一致表示将在今后工作中，努力克服个人在思想上、工作上存在的这些缺点和错误，进一步增强党的团结，做好党的工作。
    会议认为今后必须深入贯彻七届四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”，凡不利于党的团结的言论和行动必须改正；必须强调党的集体领导，反对本位主义、分散主义，健全各级党委制度；必须在党内正确地经常地开展批评与自我批评，以维护党的团结和革命利益。
