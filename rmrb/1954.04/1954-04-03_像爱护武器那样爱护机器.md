Cherish Machines Like Weapons
　　Gao Wei

　　(I)
　　In May 1952, Jin Wanfu began his formal oiling work at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' primary rolling mill.

　　On his first day at work, he walked through the rolling mill workshop, carefully "measuring" all the major rolling equipment. Seeing the red-hot steel billets rolled out by the rolling mill, he thought to himself, "How great would it be if our country had more such large rolling mills!" He wanted to take a good look at the rolling mill, but as soon as he stepped forward, he felt a soft, sticky sensation under his feet. He bent down to look and saw the floor around the machine was covered in grease, and the machine itself was covered with a thick layer of dust. He frowned and said, "How did it get so dirty?"

　　Oiler Lei Zhenyou was standing nearby, and Jin Wanfu asked, "Why isn't the dust on the machine swept away?"
　　"It's impossible to sweep clean! One layer is swept off, and another falls."
　　"If it falls, we sweep it. That's better than not sweeping at all!"
　　"Then there'd be no time to do anything else." Lei Zhenyou said coldly, turning his face away. But Jin Wanfu continued, "If it's not swept clean, the dust will get inside the machine." Before Jin Wanfu could finish speaking, Lei Zhenyou became impatient, turned around, and said, "What's the big deal about a little dust on such a big machine? And you're so concerned about a little oil spilled in such a big factory!"

　　"Comrade! That's not the right way to think!" Jin Wanfu said patiently, "If the dust on the machine is never swept, a little will fall in today, and a little will fall in tomorrow. Over time, won't the machine wear out?" Jin Wanfu pointed to the steel press and said, "If it breaks down, what will we use to roll steel? And without steel, how can we build industry?"

　　In the first few days of his job, Jin Wanfu would lecture any worker he saw not taking care of the machines. Some workers grumbled about him behind his back:
　　"That guy just likes to mind other people's business!"

　　(II)
　　Jin Wanfu is forty-one years old this year. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, he worked as a sorting worker in the primary rolling mill. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he returned home to farm. After liberation, he joined the People's Liberation Army in 1948, and in 1951, he volunteered to go to Korea to fight in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In the army, his leaders repeatedly taught him to "cherish his guns as he would cherish his own eyes." He had been a machine gunner and personally experienced the importance of taking care of weapons in battle. Therefore, in his spare time, he would disassemble, inspect, repair, and oil his machine gun. Later, he worked in technical arms, and because he took care of various machines and protected transportation equipment, he was commended for his meritorious service. Since returning to the primary rolling mill from the Korean front, he has regarded production equipment as the same as weapons. Therefore, when the leadership assigned him to do oiling work, he was very happy.

　　In the oiling team, Jin Wanfu discovered that some workers looked down on the job. Some workers did not oil on time or sweep the dust off the machines. He felt that this caused great damage to the machines. Therefore, in addition to working actively himself, he took the initiative to unite the workers and educate them on how to do their jobs well.

　　Wang Youshun, a worker in the oiling team, asked the leadership to transfer him to another job. When the leadership refused, he took it out on his work, loafing in the room while others were working outside. Jin Wanfu said to him, "Every job in the factory is important. Without us oilers, the machines won't turn, and how can the production workers produce?" Jin Wanfu explained the principles to him several times, and his thinking gradually cleared up, but he still wasn't very enthusiastic at work. After further investigation, Jin Wanfu found out that Wang Youshun also had some grievances against the team leader. Therefore, Jin Wanfu helped the team leader and Wang Youshun exchange opinions. From then on, Wang Youshun felt better and became more active in his work.

　　(III)
　　The production competition in the rolling workshop became more intense day by day. The red-hot steel billets rolled out by the rolling mill ran automatically one after another on the roller table towards the shearing machine and the continuous rolling mill…

　　The workers in the rolling team thought of nothing but hoping that the soaking pit would send steel ingots quickly, the faster the better!

　　One day, Jin Wanfu came in through the door with his lunchbox. People knew he was coming to take over his shift. But instead of going to the rest room to change into his work clothes, he walked back and forth beside the continuous rolling mill and the shearing machine, looking at this and then looking at that.

　　As soon as he walked up to the rolling mill, he stopped immediately. After listening for a while, he hurriedly ran to a rolling worker and said, "Something's wrong! Why is there a 'bang, bang' noise in the gear case? There's probably a problem!"
　　"What could be wrong? We didn't hear anything."
　　"You've been working for a shift, and you still haven't heard it?"
　　"You're not in charge, but you're sure timid!"
　　"This is a machine; we can't be careless!" Before the worker could respond, Jin Wanfu ran to find the duty foreman, Yang Chunlin. "It might be because the steel ingot is too hard!" Director Yang was not worried.

　　Jin Wanfu was very anxious. He thought, "If this rolling mill breaks down, forget about the competition, we won't even be able to complete our task." So he suggested to Director Yang, "We should check it. If this thing breaks down and can't be repaired right away, that would be terrible!" Director Yang then walked up to the rolling mill and, after listening, heard the 'bang, bang' noise inside. Director Yang asked them to try rolling a softer steel ingot, but it still made the same noise. Director Yang contacted the leadership, and people from the company also came. They inspected everything but couldn't find anything wrong, so they continued to roll steel.

　　But Jin Wanfu believed that there must be a problem, or it wouldn't make such a sound. Therefore, he said to Director Yang, "If there's nothing wrong here, we should check somewhere else. There must be something wrong somewhere!" Director Yang and the technicians went to check the rolling mill again and found that the resin bearing pad of the rolling mill was faulty. They immediately repaired it, preventing an accident from occurring with the rolling mill. Everyone admired Jin Wanfu's spirit of caring for the machines. Some workers praised him, "There are very few oilers like you!"

　　(IV)
　　In his work, Jin Wanfu always carried a dry oil bucket and walked back and forth around the machines, checking each oil cup one by one. If there was too much oil, he would adjust it; if there was too little, he would add more. In his shift, the oil in every oil cup on the machines was always just right. In addition, he often paid attention to protecting the equipment. If he noticed something wrong, he would immediately report it to the leadership.

　　One day last summer, the weather was very hot. He had just finished oiling and was wiping his sweat when he saw blue smoke coming from a screw in the rolling mill. He immediately reported it to the leadership. After some discussion, they concluded that the screw was too hot and couldn't hold the oil. The very dry oil would melt as soon as it was applied, and the oil in the gear case was bubbling. Based on this situation, they had to keep oiling it, or they would have to stop production. To keep oiling it, someone had to stand on the machine and oil it constantly. But the surface of the machine was over 60 degrees Celsius. How could anyone stand there for too long? Everyone was in a dilemma. Jin Wanfu said to everyone, "You guys hand me the oil from below, and I'll pour it from above. We can't just watch the rolling mill have an accident!" After he went up, his sweat quickly soaked through his thick canvas clothes. But he didn't care about that and insisted on pouring dry oil into the gear case. After five or six hours, it got dark, the weather cooled down a bit, and the oil in the screw stopped melting. When Jin Wanfu came down, he had difficulty even breathing, and his clothes were as if they had been soaked in water. He didn't take off his soaking clothes and lay down on a bench. Workers and workshop cadres all came to comfort him. Jin Wanfu smiled and said to everyone, "It's nothing. This is our responsibility as oilers!"

    像爱护武器那样爱护机器
  　高伟
        （一）
    一九五二年五月，金万福到鞍钢初轧厂开始正式做浇油工作。
    第一天上班，他就走遍了轧钢车间，对各种主要轧钢设备都用心“端量”了一番。他看到轧钢机轧出来的红通通的钢坯，心里想道：“咱们国家多有几个这样大的轧钢厂该多么好啊！”他要到轧钢机跟前好好看看，刚一迈步，便觉得脚底下稀软胶黏，弯腰一看，机器跟前铺满了黄油，再瞧瞧机器上，也盖着很厚的灰，他皱起眉头说：“怎么弄得这样脏呢？”
    浇油工雷振有在旁边站着，金万福就问：“机器上的灰为什么不扫一扫呢？”“那还扫得净！扫一层落一层。”“它落一层咱们扫一层，总比不扫强啊！”“那就不用干别的了。”雷振有冷淡地说完，就掉过脸去。但金万福还继续说：“要是不扫净，灰都钻进机器里去了。”还没等金万福说完，雷振有就不耐烦了，回过头来说：“这么大的机器掉点灰怕什么？这么大的工厂洒点油你又看到眼里去了！”
    “同志！你这样想就不对了！”金万福耐心地说：“机器上的灰总不扫，今天落进一点；明天落进一点，天长日久，机器不就磨坏了吗？”金万福指一指压钢机又说：“它要坏了再用什么轧钢材，要没有钢材怎么建设工业呢？”
    金万福刚刚上班这几天，一看到不爱护机器的工人就要讲两句道理。有的工人就在背地里叨咕他：
    “这个人就好管闲事！”
        （二）
    金万福今年四十一岁了。伪满时他就在初轧厂做整理工，国民党反动统治时期他回家种庄稼。解放后，一九四八年他参加了人民解放军，一九五一年又志愿赴朝参加抗美援朝的斗争。在军队里的时候，领导上一再教导他“爱护枪枝要像爱护自己的眼睛一样”。他当过机枪射手，亲身体验到爱护武器在战斗中的重要，因此他有一点闲工夫就把机枪卸下来检查、修理、擦油。后来他做技术兵种工作，因为他爱护各种机器，保护交通设备，曾立过功。自从他由朝鲜前线回到初轧厂以后，把生产设备看作和武器一样，因此领导上分配他做浇油工作时，他非常高兴。
    金万福在浇油班里，发现有些工人看不起这个工作，有的工人不按时浇油，不扫机器上的灰尘，他觉得这样对机器造成很大的损失。于是他除了自己积极工作，就主动地团结工人，教育他们搞好工作。
    浇油班工人王有顺，要求领导上调动工作。领导上不允许，他就在工作上找气，人家在外边工作，他就在屋里闲着。金万福就对他说：“工厂里每一项工作都重要，没有咱们浇油的，机器不转，生产工人怎能生产呢？”金万福向他讲几次道理，他的思想才逐渐地通了，但他在工作时还不大起劲。金万福又一了解，原来王有顺对班长还有些意见。于是金万福又帮助班长和王有顺两人交换了意见。从这以后，王有顺的心情痛快了，工作也积极起来。
        （三）
    压延车间生产竞赛一天比一天地紧张起来了。压延机轧出来的红通通的钢坯，一块接着一块在辊道上自动地跑向剪断机、连轧机……
    压延班的工人们什么也不想，一心只盼均热炉快点送钢锭，越快越好！
    有一天，金万福夹着饭盒从门口进来，人们一看便知道他是来接班的。可是他没有到休息室去换作业服，就到连轧机、剪断机的旁边来回走着，看看这个又看看那个。
    他刚走到压延机跟前，便立刻停下了。听了一会，他急忙跑到一个压延工人跟前说：“不好，牙轮包子里怎么乓啦乓啦直响，恐怕有问题！”
      “能有什么，我们怎么没听到？”
    “你们干了一班啦，还没有听到？”
      “你不管事，胆子可倒小！”
      “这是机器，可不能马马虎虎！”金万福还没等那个工人再答腔就跑去找值班主任杨春林。“可能是钢锭硬的关系！”杨主任也不着急。
    金万福可急坏了，他想：“这压延机要坏了，别说竞赛呀，就是任务也完不成。”于是他向杨主任建议：“应当检查检查，要是这个东西坏了，现在不能马上修理好，那可就糟啦！”杨主任于是走到压延机跟前，一听果然里面乓啦乓啦直响。杨主任叫轧一块较软一些的钢锭试试，但仍然那样响。杨主任和领导方面一联系，公司也来了人，检查一气并没检查出什么毛病，仍然继续轧钢。
    可是金万福认为这里一定有问题，不然不能响出这样的声音。因此他对杨主任说：“这个地方没有毛病，应当到别的地方检查检查，准是有有毛病的地方！”杨主任和技术员又到轧钢机去检查，当时发现了轧钢机的树脂瓦出了毛病，马上进行修理，避免了轧钢机发生事故。金万福这种关心机器的精神，大家很佩服，有的工人夸奖他：“像你这样的浇油工真少有啊！”（四）
    金万福在工作中总是提着干油桶在机器上来回走着，按个检查油壶，油多的就调整调整，油少的就再浇上点，在他这个班里，机器上的每个油壶里的油，总是不多也不少。此外，他还经常注意保护设备，如果看出点毛病，马上向领导上报告。
    去年夏天有一天天气十分炎热，他刚浇完油，用手巾擦汗，就看到轧钢机中螺丝冒蓝烟。他立刻报告了领导上，大家一研究，是中螺丝太热，挂不住油，很干的油一浇上，马上就化了，牙轮盘里的油直冒泡。根据这一情况，必须紧跟着浇油才可以，不然就要停止生产。要想紧跟着浇油，必须有个专人在机器上站着浇，但是机器表面上足有六十多度的温度，怎能站得时间太长呢？大家正在为难，金万福对大家说：“你们在下边给我递油，我在上边浇，咱们不能瞅着轧钢机出事故！”他上去以后不一会，汗水就浸透了很厚的帆布衣裳。但他不管这些，坚持往牙轮盘里浇干油。五、六个小时以后，天黑了，凉了一些，中螺丝的油再不化了。金万福下来时，连喘气都觉得困难，衣裳就像从水里涝出来似的。他没有脱掉水淋淋的衣裳，就躺在板凳上。工人、车间干部都来慰问他。金万福笑着对大家说：“没什么，这是我们浇油工人的责任！”
