    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge Main Bridge Project Officially Begins Construction
    [This newspaper report] The main bridge project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge officially commenced construction on April 1st.
    The main bridge project of the Yellow River Bridge is very arduous, with most of the foundation work to be carried out in the turbulent currents of the Yellow River, several dozen feet deep. From February this year, the bridge team's workers actively prepared for the start of construction. In order to complete the preparatory work as soon as possible, the workers actively put forward rationalization proposals, changing the originally designed pontoon bridge to a wooden trestle bridge, solving the difficulty of lacking iron "pontoons." Workers worked in three shifts day and night in the climate of fourteen or fifteen degrees below zero. They overcame the difficulties of rapid water flow and used six days to drive all the trestle bridge piles into the riverbed. Shipbuilders who came from Hankou to support the Yellow River Bridge project actively carried out competitions in their work, saving more than seven hundred workdays when manufacturing four large wooden boats of fifty tons and twenty-five tons.
    At the groundbreaking ceremony held on April 1st, worker representative Xia Quanpeng and labor model Chen Zhong, on behalf of all the workers, expressed their determination to pay attention to safety, ensure quality, and successfully complete the bridge construction task.

    兰新铁路黄河大桥正桥工程正式开工
    【本报讯】兰新铁路黄河大桥正桥工程在四月一日正式开工。
    黄河大桥正桥工程非常艰巨，大部基础工作要在数丈深的黄河激流中进行。从今年二月起，桥工队的职工们积极进行了开工准备。为了早日完成准备工作，职工们积极提出合理化建议，把原来设计的浮桥改为木便桥，解决了缺乏铁“浮鲸”的困难。工人们在零下十四、五度的气候里，分成三班日夜工作。他们克服了水流湍急的困难，用六天的时间把便桥的桩子都打进河底。从汉口来支援黄河大桥工程的造船工人在工作中积极开展竞赛，制造四只五十吨和二十五吨的大木船时，节省了七百多个工。
    在四月一日举行的开工典礼上，职工代表夏佺鹏和劳动模范陈中代表全体职工表示决心，要注意安全，保证质量，良好地完成大桥修建任务。
