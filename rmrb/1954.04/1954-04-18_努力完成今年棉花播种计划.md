    Strive to Fulfill This Year's Cotton Planting Plan
    Zang Chengyao
    According to the state plan, this year, in areas suitable for cotton planting, it is required not only to universally increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields but also to expand the cotton field area to a certain extent compared to 1953. According to the inspection of various regions, the Party organizations and governments in cotton-producing areas attach great importance to cotton planting and have confidence in fulfilling the cotton planting plan. However, it cannot be denied that to finally complete the cotton planting plan, there are still many difficulties, and much work must be done. The trend of reducing cotton fields in some areas has not been completely overcome, and the masses' cotton planting plans are still far from meeting the requirements of the state plan. Some farmers, although they have made plans to expand cotton fields, are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, preparing to plant more if it rains and less if it doesn't. The cotton planting season has arrived, and whether this year's cotton planting plan can be completed is at a critical juncture. Therefore, cadres in all cotton-producing areas must urgently mobilize to lead the masses in doing a good job in cotton planting and strive to complete this year's cotton planting task according to the state plan.

    Based on the experience of the previous stage of work and the existing problems in the current cotton planting work, what work should cadres in cotton-producing areas do well?

    I. To complete this year's cotton planting task according to the state plan, specific and meticulous organizational work must be carried out. There is a perception that hinders cadres from conducting specific and meticulous organizational mobilization work among the masses. This is because some cadres do not fully recognize the importance and difficulty of expanding cotton fields this year and underestimate the spontaneous reduction trend among the masses. They believe that small-scale peasant economy still accounts for a large proportion, and it is inevitable to use coercion and command when persuading and mobilizing the masses to expand cotton fields according to the state plan. Therefore, in leading cotton planting work, they only make general appeals to farmers or count the number of cotton planting households, without providing specific guidance on farmers' cotton planting plans, and consider villages that cannot complete the cotton planting plan as helpless. This understanding and practice are obviously wrong. This is another deviation that has arisen after opposing coercion and command. This deviation is to abandon leadership and regard the legitimate work that should be carried out among farmers as coercion and command. They do not understand that as long as it is not forcibly apportioning tasks to farmers or forcing them to plant, but carrying out arduous and in-depth persuasion and mobilization work and specific and meticulous organizational work to make farmers' cotton planting plans conform to the state plan, this is not only not coercion and command, but also precisely the political work that we must carry out. This approach is completely feasible. For example, the spring plowing inspection group composed of 150 people, including the Minister of Propaganda of the Xia County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, went deep into the countryside to publicize policies, overcame the trend of local farmers reducing cotton fields. Agricultural production cooperatives and many individual farmers have revised their original plans and expanded their cotton fields. According to the statistics of Hengyu, Miaocun, and 17 agricultural cooperatives and 3 mutual aid teams in Dahou, Nandali, etc., the cotton planting plan has been expanded by 14.4% compared with last year. The Zeng Guangfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shen County, Shandong Province, planted 100 mu of cotton in 1953, and originally planned to plant only 50 mu of cotton this year. After hearing that the government required expanding the cotton planting area, the cooperative members automatically increased the cotton fields to 116 mu and publicized it at the mass meeting, thus driving the whole village to increase the cotton planting area according to the state plan.

    Some people also believe that since grain production is the primary task of agricultural production in our country, we should promote more grain planting in any region, regardless of the region or situation, and therefore dare not vigorously organize the masses to expand cotton fields in cotton-producing areas. This understanding is also one-sided. Of course, grain is an indispensable thing for the people, and increasing grain production nationwide can never be relaxed at any time. However, cotton is the raw material for industrial production and an important material for people's daily use. In order to adapt to the development of the textile industry and meet the rapidly growing needs of the people for cotton fabrics and cotton, it is also necessary to plan and appropriately expand a part of the cotton field area in areas suitable for cotton planting. Although expanding the cotton field area occupies some grain fields, the total grain output can still be increased by actively increasing the yield per unit area of grain. Therefore, in areas suitable for cotton planting, emphasizing the expansion of cotton fields, increasing cotton production, and supporting industrial construction according to the state's plan is a task of equal importance to increasing grain production.

    Because the wheat fields increased and the cotton fields decreased last year, it is indeed difficult for individual suitable cotton-producing areas to complete this year's cotton planting task. For example, in Lingbao County, Henan Province, the special area assigned a cotton planting task of 291,000 mu, but in reality, only 273,000 mu can be completed. This requires allowing areas with the conditions to over-fulfill the cotton planting task to over-fulfill it, in order to supplement the deficiencies in these areas and ensure the completion of the cotton planting task according to the state plan. The method of regional adjustment proposed by Hebei Province is a suitable measure.

    II. Conscientiously do a good job in the supply of means of production and means of livelihood in cotton-producing areas, and solve the actual difficulties of cotton farmers. In some cotton-producing areas, because cotton fields are relatively concentrated, some farmers have always lacked grain. In these areas, doing a good job in grain supply in a timely manner has become an important link in whether the cotton planting task can be completed. In Jiajiazhuang Township, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, due to the specific organization of grain supply, not only did the 159 grain-deficient households who bought grain feel at ease in expanding cotton fields, but also dispelled the ideological concerns of many farmers who were not short of grain. Therefore, after conducting specific mobilization in the whole township in conjunction with grain supply work, the cotton planting plan of the farmers in the whole township was expanded from 1,230 mu last year to 2,720 mu.

    The agricultural leading organs, supply and marketing cooperative departments, and farmers in various cotton-producing areas have made certain preparations for cotton seeds, fertilizers, and pest control machinery. From the quantity point of view, cotton seeds are already sufficient, but the quality is not high. Therefore, it is very necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out grain selection, guide cotton farmers to appropriately increase the amount of sowing, and, if possible, reserve as much cotton seed as possible. In terms of fertilizer, in addition to mobilizing the masses to develop fertilizer sources, increase fertilizer accumulation, and implement the policy of using self-accumulated farmyard manure as the mainstay, the supply of commercial fertilizers must also be done well. At present, the reluctance of supply and marketing cooperative departments to sell fine fertilizer in some areas should be overcome urgently. For example, in some areas, the masses urgently need fertilizer, but the sales volume of supply and marketing cooperatives only accounts for 10% to 20% of the prepared fertilizer. Therefore, the fertilizer supply work should be done in a timely manner to dispel the masses' concerns that the yield cannot be guaranteed without fine fertilizer. Attention should be paid to checking the specifications and quality of pest control machinery and medicines. Areas where the preparation of medicines and machinery is insufficient must seize the time and prepare them as early as possible, and strengthen the guidance of the technology for using medicines and machinery.

    III. To ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan, we must also do a good job in cotton planting technical guidance, so as to ensure that one mu is planted and one mu is guaranteed, and reduce the abandonment of cotton fields. This not only guarantees the harvested area of cotton fields, but especially lays the foundation for increasing the yield per unit area. In areas where cotton suffered disasters in 1953, areas where cotton yields were not high in the past, and newly developed cotton planting areas, farmers lack cotton planting technology and have concerns about expanding cotton fields. Although cotton farmers in these areas know that planting cotton is beneficial, they are not sure about increasing cotton yields and are afraid that the result of planting cotton will be losing both cotton and grain. Therefore, strengthening the guidance of cotton planting technology is even more important in these areas. This year, Jiangxi Province, in addition to running training courses to impart technology, still regards the old cotton-producing areas as the focus in the allocation of technical cadres, and also separates a part of the technical personnel to strengthen the technical guidance in the new cotton-producing areas; Hubei Province, based on the results of the investigation and research on the low-yield cotton-producing areas in the northern part of the province last year, formulated the "Hubei Northern Cotton-Producing Area Production Increase Plan," equipped cadres, set key points, and strengthened the cotton planting technical leadership in this cotton-producing area; In addition to continuing to work hard to increase the output of irrigated cotton areas this year, Shaanxi Province has also strengthened technical guidance in dryland cotton areas. These measures are of great significance for striving to comprehensively increase cotton production.

    In addition, although the soil moisture in the northern cotton-producing areas is better than in previous years this year, there is still drought in some areas. According to the inspection in early March, only in Handan, Quzhou, Guangping, Qinghe, and other counties in Hebei Province, there are more than 200,000 mu of land with insufficient soil moisture. Especially since mid-March, there has been little rain and a lot of wind, and the land where harrowing to preserve moisture has not been done well, the land where spring plowing is late, and the light sandy land have run off the moisture very seriously, and some topsoil has dried two or three fingers again. However, some rural cadres blindly believe that the soil moisture is sufficient this year and there is no problem with planting. Therefore, the leading organs in these areas must promptly check the soil moisture of cotton fields, correct the statement that there is no problem with the soil moisture of some cotton fields, vigorously carry out harrowing to preserve soil moisture, and organize the masses to rush to sow while there is moisture, not only to ensure timely sowing and complete the cotton planting plan, but also to ensure good emergence and lay the foundation for increasing the yield per unit area.

    努力完成今年棉花播种计划
    臧成耀
    按照国家计划，在适宜种植棉花的地区，今年不仅要求普遍提高棉田单位面积产量，而且要求比一九五三年扩大一定的棉田面积。根据各地检查的情况来看，各棉区的党的组织和政府对种棉都很重视，对完成种棉计划也有信心，但是不能否认，要最后完成棉花播种计划，还有许多困难，还必须努力做好许多工作。有些地区缩减棉田的趋势还没有完全克服，群众的植棉计划和国家计划要求还有距离。有些农民虽然订了扩大棉田的计划，但仍抱着观望态度，准备下雨就多种，不下雨就少种。棉花播种季节已到，能否完成今年的棉花播种计划，目前就是决定关头，因此，各产棉区的干部必须紧急动员起来，领导群众做好种棉工作，努力争取按照国家计划完成今年的棉花播种任务。
    根据上一阶段的工作经验，和目前种棉工作中存在的问题，棉区干部应该做好那些工作呢？
    一、要按照国家计划完成今年的棉花播种任务，必须进行具体的细致的组织工作。有一种认识在阻碍着干部向群众进行具体细致的组织动员工作，这就是有些干部对今年扩大棉田的重要性和艰巨性认识不足，对群众自流缩减趋势估计不够。他们认为目前小农经济占很大比重，说服动员群众按照国家的计划扩大棉田，难免强迫命令。因而在领导种棉工作中只向农民进行一般号召，或按户统计一下植棉数字，对农民订种棉计划不进行具体领导，对不能完成种棉计划的村庄，认为是无可奈何的事情。这种认识和做法显然是错误的。这是在反对强迫命令以后产生的另一种偏向。这种偏向就是放弃领导，把应当向农民进行的正当工作也看成是强迫命令。不了解只要不是向农民强迫摊派字数，强迫下种而是向农民进行艰苦深入的说服动员工作和具体、细致的组织工作，使农民的种棉计划和国家计划相符合，这不仅不是强迫命令，而且正是我们必须进行的政治工作。这种作法是完全可行的。如中共山西省夏县县委宣传部长等一百五十人组成的春耕检查小组，深入农村宣传政策后，克服了当地农民缩减棉田的趋势，农业生产合作社以及很多个体农民都修改了原来的计划，扩大了棉田。据恒峪、苗村两村及大候、南大里等十七个农业社和三个互助组的统计，植棉计划比去年扩大了百分之十四点四。山东莘县曾广福农业生产合作社，一九五三年植棉一百亩，今年原计划只种棉五十亩。他们听到政府要求扩大植棉面积后，社员们就自动把棉田增种到一百一十六亩，并在群众大会上进行了宣传，因而带动了全村按照国家计划增加植棉面积。
    还有一些人，认为既然粮食生产是我国农业生产的首要任务，就应不分地区，不分情况，在任何地区都宣传多种粮食，因而也不敢在棉区大力组织群众扩大棉田。这种认识也是片面的。当然粮食是人民一日不可缺少的东西，在全国范围内提高粮食生产量是任何时候也不能放松的。但是棉花是工业生产的原料和人民日用的重要物资，为了适应纺织工业的发展和满足人民对棉织品和棉花迅速增长的需要，在适宜植棉的地区有计划地适当地扩大一部分棉田面积，也是必要的。扩大棉田面积虽然占了一些粮田，但由于积极提高粮食单位面积产量，粮食总产量还是可以增加的。因此在宜棉地区按照国家的计划强调宣传扩大棉田，增产棉花，支援工业建设，这是和增产粮食同等重要的任务。
    由于去年麦田增多，棉田减少，个别宜棉地区要完成今年的植棉任务确有困难。如河南省灵宝县，专区分配植棉任务为二十九万一千亩，实际上只能完成二十七万三千亩。这就需要在有条件超额完成植棉任务的地区准许其超额完成，以补充这些地区的不足，来保证按照国家计划完成种棉任务。河北省提出地区调整的办法是一种适宜的措施。
    二、切实作好棉区的生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，解决棉农的实际困难。有的棉区因为棉田比较集中，有些农户一向缺少粮食。在这种地区及时作好粮食供应工作，就成为能否完成植棉任务的重要环节。山西省汾阳县贾家庄乡，由于具体组织了粮食供应工作，不但使买到粮食的一百五十九户缺粮户安心扩大棉田，并且还解除了许多不缺粮的农民的思想顾虑，因而全乡结合粮食供应工作进行具体动员后，全乡农民的种棉计划由去年的一千二百三十亩扩大到二千七百二十亩。
    各棉区的农业领导机关、供销合作部门以及农民群众对棉种、肥料和治虫药械，都有了一定的准备。棉种从数量上看已经够用，但质量不高。因此大力发动群众进行粒选，指导棉农适当增加播种量，并在可能情况下，尽量多储备一些棉种，都是十分必要的。肥料方面，除应发动群众开辟肥源，增积肥料，贯彻以施用农家自积肥料为主的方针外，对商品肥料的供应工作，也必须做好。目前某些地区供销合作部门对细肥的惜售思想急应克服。如有的地区群众需肥迫切，但供销合作社的出售量只占到已准备肥料数量的百分之十至二十。因此，应及时作好肥料供应工作，解除群众怕没有细肥不能保证产量的顾虑。对防治病虫药械的规格和质量要注意检查，药械准备不足的地区须抓紧时间及早准备，并加强对药械使用技术的指导工作。
    三、要保证完成种棉计划，还必须做好植棉技术指导工作，作到种一亩保一亩，减少废弃棉田。这样不仅保证了棉田的收获面积，特别是为提高单位面积产量打下了基础。一九五三年棉花受灾的地区，过去棉花产量不高的地区和新发展植棉的地区，农民群众缺乏植棉技术，对扩大棉田有顾虑。这些地区的棉农虽然知道种棉花有利，但对提高棉花产量没把握，怕种棉花的结果是棉花粮食两丢。因此，加强植棉技术的指导工作，在这些地区就更显得重要。江西省今年除办训练班传授技术外，在技术干部的配备上，老棉区仍作为重点，并分出一部分技术人员加强新棉区的技术指导；湖北省针对去年在本省北部低产棉区调查研究的结果，制订了“鄂北棉区增产方案”，配备干部，设置重点，加强了对这一棉区的种棉技术领导；陕西省今年除继续努力提高灌溉棉区的产量外，对旱地棉区也加强了技术指导工作，这些措施对争取全面地提高棉花产量是有重要意义的。
    另外，今年北方棉区虽然土壤墒情比往年好，但部分地区仍有干旱现象，根据三月上旬的检查，河北省仅邯郸、曲周、广平、清河等县就有二十多万亩土地墒情不足。尤其是三月中旬以来，雨少风多，耙地保墒工作没有做好的地，春耕迟的地和轻沙地跑墒很严重，有的表土又干了两三指。但是某些乡村干部却盲目地认为今年土墒足，种植没有问题。因此，这些地区的领导机关必须及时检查棉田墒情，纠正某些棉田墒土没有问题的说法，大力开展耙地保墒工作，并组织群众抢墒播种，不但要保证及时播种，完成棉花播种计划，还要保证出苗良好，给提高单位面积产量打下基础。
