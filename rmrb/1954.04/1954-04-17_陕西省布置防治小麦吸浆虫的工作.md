Shaanxi Province's Wei River valley has suffered from wheat blossom midge damage for years, and in recent years, it has also been discovered in the Han River area of southern Shaanxi. Last year, according to statistics from twenty-two counties and cities, the affected wheat field area reached over 1.4 million mu, with a general loss rate of about 15%. This year, according to key inspections in various parts of Guanzhong, the situation of underground larvae is more serious than last year. Due to the warm winter last year and the abundant rain and snow this spring, which are suitable for the survival of pests, the emergence period of larvae this year will also be five or six days earlier than last year, with the peak period around April 20th. Last year, various parts of the province achieved great success in preventing and controlling wheat blossom midge, but because they started two or three days late, they still suffered certain losses. For this reason, the Party and government leaders of the province decided to start prevention and control earlier. After the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued an emergency notice on April 3 regarding preparations for paying attention to inspection and prevention and control of wheat blossom midge, on the 9th, it cooperated with the Provincial Finance Committee and the Rural Work Department of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee and other units to form a provincial headquarters for the prevention and control of wheat blossom midge. Han Zhao'e, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, was appointed as the director of the committee. Su Zichen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and two others were appointed as deputy directors, to uniformly direct the province's prevention and control work. The headquarters has dispatched cadres to Chang'an, Lantian, and Zhouzhi, three key demonstration prevention and control counties, to assist in the work. Counties that have historically suffered from severe blossom midge disasters have also successively established pest control headquarters. Xingping and other counties have launched extensive publicity and mobilization work for the prevention and control of blossom midge. The Provincial Federation of Cooperatives has transferred 1.25 million jin of 0.5% "666" powder to 23 counties and cities in Guanzhong and some areas in southern Shaanxi as early as possible to supply the masses for prevention and control. The Provincial Pesticide Processing Plant is organizing forces to rush to produce "666" powder.

After the deployment of prevention and control preparation work, the agricultural technology guidance stations in various places have also raised their vigilance and continuously carried out pest forecasting and reporting. Since the supply of pesticides and machinery cannot yet meet the needs, various places are vigorously promoting the effective use of dry soft nets, hand-held dry net clips, and continuing to make their own airplane-style and curtain-frame-style powder spreaders, which were effective last year.

    陕西省布置防治小麦吸浆虫的工作
    陕西省渭河流域，历年都受到小麦吸浆虫的危害，近年陕南汉水一带也有发现。去年据二十二个县、市的统计，被害麦田面积约达一百四十多万亩，损失率一般约在百分之十五左右。今年根据关中各地的重点检查，潜伏地下的幼虫情况比去年严重。由于去冬天暖，今春雨雪较多，适宜于害虫的生存，今年幼虫出土期也将比去年提前五、六天，即在四月二十日左右为盛发期。去年该省各地对防治小麦吸浆虫虽取得很大成绩，但因为动手迟了两三天，仍受到一定的损失。为此，该省党政领导方面，决定提早防治。省农林厅于本月三日发出了关于注意检查和防治小麦吸浆虫准备工作的紧急通知后，九日，即配合省财委及中共陕西省委会农村工作部等单位，组成了全省防治小麦吸浆虫指挥部。由省人民政府副主席韩兆鹗任主任委员。省农林厅副厅长苏资琛等三人任副主任委员，统一指挥全省防治工作。指挥部已抽调干部分赴长安、蓝田、盩厔三个重点示范防治县协助工作。凡是历年吸浆虫灾害严重的县份，亦相继成立了防虫指挥部。兴平等县展开了防治吸浆虫的广泛宣传动员工作。省合作社联合社已将千分之五的“六六六”药粉一百二十五万斤及早调运到了关中二十三县、市及陕南部分地区，以供应群众防治之用。省农药加工厂正组织力量，赶制“六六六”药粉。
    在防治准备工作布置以后，各地农业技术指导站，也都提高警惕，连续进行虫害测报。由于药械还不能满足需要，故各地大量推广去年行之有效的拉用干软网、手执干网夹和继续自制飞机式、帘架式撒粉器等。
