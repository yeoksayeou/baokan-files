Most Livestock in the Ili Special District Safely Transferred to Spring Pastures

Under the leadership and assistance of Party and government organs, people of all ethnic groups in the Ili Special District of Xinjiang have now basically overcome the snow disaster. The majority of livestock have been safely transferred to spring pastures, and various female animals have begun to give birth widely.

Last winter, the snowfall in various parts of the Ili Special District was heavier than in previous years. After the beginning of spring this year, the climate was erratic, with heavy snowfalls occurring one after another. Much of the pasture grass was covered by accumulated snow, seriously threatening the safety of livestock. In addition to instructing the work teams already dispatched to various counties to strengthen their leadership in disaster relief work, the CPC Ili District Committee and the Ili Special Administrative Office also sent responsible cadres such as Kuerban Ali, Deputy Commissioner of the Ili Special Administrative Office, to Nilek, Bole, Wenquan, Tekes, Zhaosu and other counties to provide specific guidance for disaster relief work. Party and government leaders in counties primarily engaged in animal husbandry have made spring animal husbandry production and leading the masses to overcome natural disasters the overriding central task at present. Wenquan County established a "Temporary Office for Protecting Livestock Safety" to specifically guide disaster relief work; and organized five work teams to go deep into various pastures to conduct livestock protection and disaster prevention education for the broad masses of herdsmen. At the same time, some pastureland was appropriately allocated to herdsmen who lacked grazing for their livestock. Veterinary cadres also actively treated various livestock diseases for the masses, and gave preventive injections to some strong livestock. As a result, more than 190,000 livestock in Wenquan County did not suffer major losses. The salt sales branches in Tekes and Jinghe counties promptly supplied herdsmen with more than 113,000 jin of tax-free salt, which enhanced the cold resistance of disaster-stricken livestock. The People's Banks in Tekes and Gongliu counties issued more than 230 million yuan in livestock protection loans, helping herdsmen solve the difficulties of lacking grass for their livestock, so that more than 300,000 livestock in the two counties did not suffer major losses. The Fifth District of Xinyuan County mobilized the masses to help each other by borrowing and lending grass and fodder, and more than 10,000 bundles of grass were mutually borrowed and lent. Jinghe County also mobilized herdsmen to organize thirteen wolf-hunting teams to prevent wolf hazards in the spring. Now the weather has gradually turned warmer, most of the accumulated snow has melted, and green grass has sprouted. After vigorous rescue efforts, the masses of herdsmen in the entire district have basically overcome the snow disaster. Most of the livestock herds in Wenquan, Tekes and other counties have been transferred to spring pastures.

    伊犁专区大部牲畜安全转入春季牧场
    新疆伊犁专区各族牧民在党政机关的领导和帮助下，现已基本上战胜了雪灾。大部分牲畜已安全转入春季牧场，各种母畜已开始普遍产羔。
    去年冬季，伊犁专区各地降雪较往年都多，今年入春以后，气候变化无常，先后降落大雪，牧草多被积雪封盖，牲畜的安全受到严重的威胁。中共伊犁地委及伊犁专署除指示已派往各县的工作组加强领导救灾工作外，伊犁专署副专员库尔班阿里等负责干部分赴尼勒克、博乐、温泉、特克斯、昭苏等县具体指导救灾工作。以畜牧业为主的县的党政领导把春季畜牧业生产及领导群众战胜自然灾害作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。温泉县成立了“保护牲畜安全临时办公室”，专门负责指导救灾工作；并组织了五个工作组，深入各牧场，向广大牧民进行保畜防灾教育。同时，适当地给缺少牲畜吃草的牧民调剂了一部分草场。兽医干部也积极给群众医治各种牲畜疾病，并给一部分长得壮实的牲畜进行了预防注射。因此，温泉县十九万多头牲畜没有受到大的损失。特克斯、精河两县盐务分销处及时给牧民供应了免税盐十一万三千多斤，使受灾牲畜增强了防寒抵抗力。特克斯、巩留两县人民银行发放了二亿三千多万元保畜贷款，帮助牧民解决了牲畜缺草的困难，使两县三十多万头牲畜没受大的损失。新源县五区发动群众互助互借草料，互助互借的草就有一万多捆。精河县还发动牧民组织了十三个打狼小组，防止春季狼害。现在天气已渐转暖，积雪多已融化，青草也已发芽。经过大力抢救，全区牧民群众已基本上战胜了雪灾。温泉、特克斯等县大部分畜群都已转入了春季牧场。
