Throughout the rural areas of Northwest China, spring ploughing is now in full swing. In the "Eight Hundred Li Qinchuan" of Shaanxi's Guanzhong region, most wheat fields have been hoed for the first time. Farmers in the rice-growing areas along the Han River in southern Shaanxi are preparing paddy fields and carrying out spring irrigation. In northern Shaanxi, spring wheat and barley are being sown. Cotton farmers are also preparing cotton fields and beginning sowing. In Ningxia Province, 70 percent of spring wheat sowing has been completed, while Gansu and Qinghai have also begun sowing in the river valley areas. In Xinjiang Province, herders are actively engaged in spring production, with herdsmen in Manas County beginning spring pasturing and intensively carrying out lambing and rearing work.

This year, all regions emphasize promoting advanced experience and improving farming techniques during spring ploughing. The 5.32 million mu of spring wheat sown throughout the region are universally treated with "Ceresan" seed dressing. In Chenggu area of southern Shaanxi, wheat and rice yields have been affected in recent years due to seedling shortages, lodging, and diseases and pests. The local Qixing Agricultural Technology Guidance Station has decided to focus this year on teaching techniques such as close planting in paddy fields, preventing lodging, and rational fertilization for rice, and on preventing pests, frost, and lodging for wheat. The Yongle Agricultural Technology Guidance Station is focusing its guidance on the Pangjia Village Mutual Aid Group. All 220 mu of winter wheat in the group have been harrowed once and have been applied with 1,030 jin of chemical fertilizer and 1,900+ jin of ash, and 830 jin of selected cotton seeds. The party and government leadership in Zhouzhi County also learn from Comrade Ren Guodong's experience, grasp the leadership of spring ploughing production, and improve spring ploughing operations. The county started spring ploughing five to ten days earlier than in previous years. The area of wheat fields with topdressing has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Most of the land of the county's three agricultural production cooperatives has been ploughed one to three inches deeper than last year.

People's governments at all levels in various regions have also strengthened a series of economic measures during spring ploughing to solve the actual difficulties of farmers in various aspects. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have promptly supplied production materials such as farm tools, draught animals, and fertilizers. Since last year, they have supplied farmers with more than 5,880 head of livestock, and 170 tons of "Ceresan" are being successively delivered to rural areas in various provinces. The Gansu Provincial Grain Bureau and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry have supplied all 1.2 million jin of the three fine wheat varieties, "No. 96", "No. 774", and "Yupin", to farmers. Since last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied farmers with more than 900,000 pieces of farm tools of all sizes, such as hoe-knives, chain knives, and plowshares. The Ningxia Provincial Cooperative has supplied farmers with 500,000 jin of rapeseed cake from its reserves. People's Banks at all levels have also actively issued agricultural loans to help farmers solve difficulties in production. As of March 20, according to incomplete statistics, more than 14 billion yuan in agricultural loans have been issued throughout the region. Credit cooperative organizations in various regions have also promptly carried out business activities.

    西北各地农村全面展开春耕工作
    【本报讯】西北各地农村已全面展开春耕生产工作。陕西关中地区的“八百里秦川”的麦地上，大部麦田已锄过头遍；南部汉水两岸水稻区的农民，正在整理稻田和进行春灌工作；陕北地区开始播种春小麦和大麦；棉区农民也正在整理棉田和开始播种。宁夏省春麦播种已完成百分之七十，甘肃和青海川地也开始播种。新疆省各地牧民正在积极进行春季生产，玛纳斯县牧民开始春牧，并紧张进行接羔育羔工作。
    今年春耕中，各地都重视推广先进经验和改进耕作技术。全区播种的五百三十二万亩春小麦，普遍都使用“赛力散”药剂拌种。陕南城固一带的小麦和稻子，几年来因为缺苗、倒伏和病、虫灾害而影响产量的提高，该地的七星农业技术指导站，即决定今年以传授稻田密植、防止倒伏和合理施肥等技术为主，小麦以防虫、防霜、防倒伏为主。永乐农业技术指导站，重点指导的庞家村互助联组，全组二百二十亩冬麦，已全部耱过一遍，并分别上了一千零三十斤化学肥料和一千九百多斤草木灰，粒选棉种八百三十斤。盩厔县党政领导方面还学习任国栋同志的经验，抓紧春耕生产领导，改进春耕作业，全县比往年提前五天到十天开始春耕生产，施追肥的麦田比去年增加百分之十以上，全县三个农业生产合作社的土地，大部分比去年深耕一寸到三寸。
    各地各级人民政府，在春耕中也加强了一系列的经济工作，替农民解决各方面的实际困难。各地供销合作社，及时地供应了农具、耕畜和肥料等生产资料。他们从去年以来，已供应给农民五千八百八十多头牲口，一百七十吨“赛力散”正陆续送到各省农村。甘肃省粮食厅和农林厅将“九十六号”、“七七四”、“玉皮”三种小麦优良品种一百二十万斤，全数供应农民。新疆省供销合作社自去年以来已供应农民砍土镘、链刀、犁铧等大小农具九十多万件。宁夏省社已将储备的五十万斤油渣供应给农民。各级人民银行也积极发放农贷，帮助农民解决生产中的困难。截至三月二十日，据不完全统计，全区已发放农业贷款一百四十多亿元。各地信用合作组织，也及时开展了业务活动。
