    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 24th: State-owned commercial and cooperative commercial departments in the Central-South region have established an annual processing and ordering plan.
    It has been decided that the total value of processing and ordering in various locations throughout the region this year will increase by more than two times compared to last year; among them, the processing and ordering of rural production materials will increase the most, with cake fertilizer increasing by about ten times and agricultural tools increasing by about twenty times.
    This year, about two-thirds of the commodities managed by state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises in the region are processed and ordered locally, and half of these products can be delivered from factories and supplied to the market in the first half of the year. Commodities needed for summer in the region, such as cloth, undershirts, and vests, have already begun to be allocated and supplied in the first quarter. In terms of production materials, according to incomplete statistics from cooperatives in some areas of the Central-South region, six to seven million pieces of agricultural tools have been supplied since the beginning of this year.
    Currently, provinces and cities in the Central-South region are preparing to establish an agency to uniformly manage processing and ordering. State-owned commercial departments in Guangzhou and Wuhan have respectively conducted product inspections of private industries engaged in processing and ordering. Many industries among private enterprises in Wuhan have gradually achieved the completion of the state's processing tasks in terms of quality, quantity, and on time.

    中南区商业部门订出全年加工订货计划
    【新华社武汉二十四日电】中南区国营商业和合作社商业已订出全年加工订货的计划。
    决定今年全区在各地加工订货的总值比去年增加两倍多；其中比去年增加最多的是农村生产资料的加工订货，饼肥约增加十多倍，农具约增加二十倍。
    今年全区国营商业和合作社商业经营的商品中有三分之二左右是在当地加工订货的，这些产品有一半在上半年就可出厂供应市场。全区夏令需要的布匹、汗衫、背心等商品在第一季度就已开始调拨供应了。生产资料方面，据中南区部分地区合作社的不完全统计，今年以来，已供应农具六、七百万件。
    目前，中南区各省、市正准备筹备一个统一管理加工订货的机构。广州、武汉两市国营商业部门已分别对加工订货的私营工业进行产品检查。武汉市私营企业中有不少行业已逐步做到按质、按量、按期完成国家的加工任务。
