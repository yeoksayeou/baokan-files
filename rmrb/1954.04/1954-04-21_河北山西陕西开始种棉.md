    Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi Begin Planting Cotton
    Farmers in many areas of Hebei Province are now actively planting cotton. Various localities have strengthened their leadership over cotton planting. Party and government leaders in Wu'an County first went to key villages to sum up the farmers' experience in drought-resistant planting, and then sent 125 cadres to the countryside to widely impart knowledge and lead the farmers in drought-resistant cotton planting. Bangjun Township in Ji County held a symposium of experienced farmers to sum up their cotton planting experience, and then organized 180 propagandists to widely publicize it to the farmers, quickly mobilizing them and creating a cotton planting upsurge. Some areas are seizing the moisture to plant while also developing water conservancy projects to prepare for watering and spot planting. For example, Daming County has led farmers to dig 451 earthen wells and prepared many water transportation tools. In Ningjin County, the Second District is mobilizing farmers to plant early in areas where the soil moisture is good but may be lost, and at the same time mobilizing farmers to dig wells and buy water carts to prepare for drought-resistant spot planting.
    After two rainfalls on April 6th and 14th, the soil in most areas of Baoding Prefecture had enough moisture for planting. The CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee drew 157 cadres from various agencies of the prefecture, led by seven members of the Prefectural Committee, to inspect and promote cotton planting in six key counties, including Dingxing, Xushui, and Qingyuan.
    In Shanxi Province, more than 700 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Yuncheng Prefecture are leading the broad masses of farmers in carrying out drought-resistant cotton planting. Since March, the rainfall in the area has been extremely scarce. In early April, the dry soil in the cotton fields of various counties generally reached more than one inch. Farmers generally had the idea of waiting for rain and were not actively taking action to seize the moisture to plant. After the CPC Yuncheng Prefectural Committee and the Yuncheng Prefectural Administrative Office issued an emergency notice to various counties on April 5th to reverse the farmers' idea of waiting for rain and launch a drought-resistant planting campaign, the agricultural producers' cooperatives in various counties were the first to respond to this call and promoted the drought-resistant cotton planting work with their active actions. Within a week, five agricultural producers' cooperatives, including Qu Yaoli and Xi Zhanggeng in Jie County, planted more than 900 mu of cotton fields. The Xiaozhangwu Agricultural Cooperative mobilized 68 men and women laborers to plant 100 mu on April 10th. The cotton field planting work in various townships of Ruicheng has begun under the leadership of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams.
    Farmers in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi have also begun planting cotton. In the Jinghui irrigated cotton area, the first spring irrigation of about 10,000 mu of cotton fields in late March has been mostly planted. The Jinghui Cotton Planting Station of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Experiment General Station began planting on April 9th. Farmers in Wugong, Hua County, Chaoyi, Xianyang and other places are also working intensively on cotton planting.

    河北山西陕西开始种棉
    河北省不少地区的农民，现正积极播种棉花。各地加强了对种棉的领导。武安县党、政领导干部先分头深入重点乡村，总结农民抗旱播种的经验，然后派出一百二十五名干部下乡普遍传授，领导农民抗旱种棉。蓟县邦均镇召开了老农座谈会，总结了农民种棉的经验，然后组织一百八十名宣传员向农民广泛宣传，很快把农民发动起来，造成种棉热潮。有些地区一面抢墒播种，一面开展水利，准备浇水点种。如大名县已领导农民挖好四百五十一眼土井，并准备了好些运水工具。宁津县二区对现在墒土较好但可能跑墒的地，发动农民及早播种，同时发动农民打井、买水车，准备抗旱点种。
    保定专区各县在四月六日、十四日落了两次雨，一般地区都接上了湿土，正适合播种。中共保定地委从专区各机关抽调一百五十七名干部，由七个地委委员带领分赴定兴、徐水、清苑等六个重点县检查并推动种棉工作。
    山西省运城专区七百多个农业生产合作社带动广大农民展开棉田抗旱播种工作。该区三月份以来，雨量奇缺。四月初旬，各县棉田干土一般达一寸以上。农民普遍存在等雨思想，不积极动手抢墒播种。中共运城地委、运城专署四月五日紧急通知各县扭转农民等雨思想、展开抗旱播种运动后，各县农业生产合作社首先响应了这一号召，并以他们的积极行动推动了棉田的抗旱播种工作。解县曲耀离、西张耿等五个农业生产合作社在一个星期以内就播种棉田九百余亩。小张坞农业社六十八个男女劳力一齐动手，四月十日一天即抢墒下种一百亩。芮城各乡的棉田播种工作在农业社与互助组带动下，都已开始。
    陕西关中地区农民也开始播种棉花。泾惠灌溉棉区，三月下旬第一次春灌棉田约一万余亩，已大都下种。陕西省农事试验总场泾惠植棉作业站四月九日已开始下种。武功、华县、朝邑、咸阳等地农民也都正在紧张进行棉花播种工作。
