Shanghai Suburbs Increase Planting of Famous Vegetables
    City Residents Can Sample Early

The farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai have increased the planting of many famous vegetables this year. Shanghai residents will be able to eat "Wuxi Water Bamboo Shoots," "Yixing Taro," "Shandong Chinese Cabbage," "Ningbo Radish," and "Sichuan Preserved Vegetables" produced in the city's suburbs this year. At the same time, residents can also taste fresh vegetables such as "Dwarf Red Gold" tomatoes earlier. In previous years, "Dwarf Red Gold" tomatoes were not available until after June 1st, but this year they can be sampled around mid-May; common vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, winter melons, cowpeas, and Chinese cabbage can also be available a week earlier and can be supplied until "Frost's Descent." Soon, Shanghai residents will also be able to eat delicious fruits such as watermelons, peaches, strawberries, and grapes, which suburban farmers have begun to trial and expand planting this year.

    上海郊区增植许多著名菜蔬
    全市人民可以提早尝新
    上海市郊区的农民们今年增植了许多著名菜蔬。上海市民今年将可吃到该市郊区出产的“无锡茭白”、“宜兴芋艿”、“山东黄芽菜”、“宁波萝卜”和“四川榨菜”。同时，市民们还可提前吃到“矮红金”蕃茄等新鲜蔬菜。往年，“矮红金”蕃茄要在六月一日以后才能上市，而今年在五月半左右便可尝新了；一般的蕃茄、茄子、冬瓜、豇豆和大白菜等家常菜蔬，也可提前一星期上市，并可一直供应到“霜降”。不久以后，上海市民们还可吃到今年郊区农民开始试种和扩种的西瓜、桃子、草莓和葡萄等鲜美可口的水果。
