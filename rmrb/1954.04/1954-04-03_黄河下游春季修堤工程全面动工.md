    The spring dyke repair project in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has fully commenced. This year's dyke repair project in the lower Yellow River includes 9.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than 173,000 cubic meters of stonework, more than 4.764 million kilograms of willow materials, more than 1.19 million trees to be planted, more than 5.784 million square meters of grass to be planted, and more than 5 million dike probes. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, the repair and defense agencies at all levels in Henan and Shandong provinces have successively started work in late February to mid-March, in conjunction with spring production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Before the start of work, each section made proper arrangements for agricultural production. The Shandong Yellow River Conservancy Bureau allocated more than 6.8 billion yuan in advance to solve the difficulties faced by the dike repair workers in purchasing tools and in production and life after leaving their homes. The equipment department also purchased more than 400 rubber-tired carts for the contracting teams in various places. After the propaganda and education of the general line, more than 50,000 farmers along the river formed contracting teams to participate in the dyke repair. After the start of work, labor competitions were successively carried out in various sections, and operation methods were improved, which increased the efficiency of the project. The Yellow River engineering teams have also piloted the method of linked contracts and assembly line operations, and the quality of stonework has been greatly improved. In order to go deep into the construction site to strengthen construction management and exchange work experience, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Shandong and Henan Provincial River Affairs Bureaus have separately organized engineering inspection teams to go deep into the construction site for inspection, and specifically help backward sections improve their work, in order to achieve balanced development of the entire project.

    黄河下游春季修堤工程全面动工
    黄河下游春季修堤工程已全面开工。今年黄河下游修堤工程，包括土方工程九百六十万公方，石方工程十七万三千多公方，柳料工程四百七十六万四千多公斤，植树一百一十九万多株，植草五百七十八万四千多平方公尺，锥探大堤五百多万眼。河南、山东两省各级修防机关在当地党委统一领导下，结合春季生产及互助合作运动已在二月下旬至三月中旬先后分别开工。各工段在开工前对农业生产都做了妥善安排，山东黄河河务局为解决修河民工置办修河工具和离家后的生产生活上的困难，预先拨出了六十八亿余万元，器材部门并为各地包工队购置了四百多辆胶轮车。沿河农民经过总路线的宣传教育后，有五万多农民组成包工队参加修堤。开工后，各工段先后开展了劳动竞赛，改进了操作方法。提高了工程效率。黄河各工程队并试行了联系合同和流水作业法，石方工程质量有了很大的提高。为了深入工地加强施工管理和交流工作经验，黄河水利委员会和山东、河南两省河务局都分别组织了工程检查组深入工地进行检查，并具体帮助落后工段改进工作，以求整个工程平衡发展。　（徐思敬）
