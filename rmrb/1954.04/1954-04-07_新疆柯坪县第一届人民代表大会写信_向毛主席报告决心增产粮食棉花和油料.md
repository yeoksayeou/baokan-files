The First People's Congress of Keping County, Xinjiang, Writes a Letter
Reporting to Chairman Mao Their Determination to Increase Grain, Cotton, and Oil Production

Respected Chairman Mao:

We, representing all the people of Keping County, Xinjiang Province, extend our highest respect to you. Under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and drove out the imperialist elements, thus liberating ourselves. We have carried out a series of social reform movements, including rent reduction and anti-hegemony, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, and have actively engaged in the work of restoring and developing production, and developing mutual aid and cooperation. We are producing more grain year by year, far exceeding the pre-liberation level; the lives of the people throughout the county have also improved accordingly.

Last winter and this spring, our county conducted grassroots elections. On February 18th of this year, the first People's Congress of our county, democratically elected by the people of the whole county, opened. This is an unprecedentedly happy event for the people of our county, a common happy event for the people of the whole country, and a glorious victory for the national policy of the Chinese Communist Party and you.

We, all the people's representatives, listened to and reviewed the work report of the county people's government for the past three years with a serious and responsible attitude, listened to the report of the secretary of the CPC county committee on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, discussed and approved the 1954 production plan, and elected the county head and members of the county people's government for this term. We have exercised the people's democratic rights on behalf of the people of the whole county and organized the people's political power. The people throughout the county deeply know that without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, we would not be able to obtain today's democratic rights and happy life. The facts tell us that we must resolutely follow the Chinese Communist Party and you.

The general line has illuminated our vision and clarified the path forward for us. We are resolutely following the direction you have indicated and forging ahead courageously. This year, our county plans to produce more than 7.3 million jin of various grains, with a unit area yield increase of 4.73 percent compared to last year; produce more than 25,000 jin of ginned cotton, with a unit area yield increase of 8.5 percent compared to last year; produce more than 38,000 jin of oil crops, with a unit area yield increase of 3.53 percent compared to last year; livestock production is to increase by more than 15 percent compared to last year; in addition, we must protect existing trees and plant an average of three more trees per person within one year. In order to accomplish this plan, we have resolved to further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in accordance with the methods you have indicated, strive to organize 40 percent of the county's farmers, of which 10 percent of the organized farmers will participate in year-round mutual aid teams, and establish an agricultural production cooperative in the second half of the year, gradually embarking on the road of agricultural collectivization. At the same time, we must improve farming methods, promote new agricultural tools, and exchange production experiences. Last year, our county's farmers sold more than 300,000 jin of grain to the state, and this year we plan to sell more grain to the state to support national economic construction. We will never waste our various agricultural, livestock, and sideline income from last year, but will first use it to purchase farming cattle and agricultural tools to expand reproduction, and appropriately improve our lives. We will deposit surplus funds in the bank or purchase public bonds to help the state accumulate construction funds.

We and the people of the whole county deeply realize that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, we will certainly be able to mobilize the people of the whole county to work actively and victoriously complete all our tasks, and together with the people of the whole country, enable the motherland to realize socialism at an early date.

We and the people of the whole county wish you—our wise leader—good health and longevity!

The First People's Congress of Keping County, Xinjiang Province

    新疆柯坪县第一届人民代表大会写信
    向毛主席报告决心增产粮食棉花和油料敬爱的毛主席：
    我们代表新疆省柯坪县全体人民向您致崇高的敬意。在您和中国共产党的领导下，新疆各族人民与全国人民一道，打倒了国民党反动派的黑暗统治，赶走了帝国主义分子，使自己得到了解放。我们进行了减租反霸、镇压反革命、土地改革一系列的社会改革运动，积极进行恢复和发展生产的工作，开展互助合作。我们打的粮食一年比一年多了，远远超过了解放前的水平；全县人民的生活也随着改善了。
    去冬今春，我县进行了基层选举。今年二月十八日，由全县人民民主选出的我县第一次人民代表大会开幕了。这是我县人民有史以来从未有过的一件大喜事，是全国人民一件共同的喜事，是中国共产党和您的民族政策的辉煌胜利。
    我们全体人民代表，以严肃负责的态度，听取并审查了县人民政府三年来的工作报告，听取了中共县委书记关于国家过渡时期总路线总任务的报告，讨论并通过了一九五四年生产计划，选举了这一届的县长和县人民政府委员。我们代表全县人民行使了人民的民主权利，组织了人民的政权机构。全县人民都深切地知道，没有中国共产党和您的领导，我们就不能得到今天的民主权利与幸福生活。事实告诉我们，必须坚决跟着中国共产党和您走。
    总路线照亮了我们的眼界，照清了我们前进的道路。我们坚决遵循着您所指示的方向奋勇前进。我县今年计划生产各种粮食七百三十余万市斤，单位面积产量要比去年提高百分之四点七三；生产皮棉二万五千市斤以上，单位面积产量要比去年增加百分之八点五；生产油料作物三万八千市斤以上，单位面积产量比去年增加百分之三点五三；牧畜业要比去年增产百分之十五以上；此外，还要保护现有树木，并在一年内每人平均再植树三株。为了完成这个计划，我们决议遵照您所指示的办法，进一步展开互助合作运动，争取组织起来的农户达到全县农户的百分之四十，其中参加常年互助组的农户要达到组织起来的农户的百分之十，下半年建立一个农业生产合作社，逐步走上农业合作化的道路。同时，我们要改进耕作法，推广新式农具，交流生产经验。去年我们全县农民卖给国家三十多万斤粮食，今年我们准备卖给国家更多的粮食，来支援国家经济建设。我们决不浪费去年的农牧副业各项收入，要首先用于添购耕畜农具以扩大再生产，并适当地改善生活，多余的款项存入银行，或认购公债，以帮助国家积累建设资金。
    我们和全县人民深深地体会到：有了中国共产党和您的领导，我们一定能够带动全县人民积极努力，胜利地完成我们的一切任务，并和全国人民一起使祖国早日实现社会主义。
    我们和全县人民祝您——我们英明的领袖身体健康，万寿无疆！
      新疆省柯坪县第一届人民代表大会
