Youth in Major Cities Across the Country Actively Prepare to Welcome "May Fourth"

This year marks the 35th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement and the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Youth in major cities across the country are actively preparing to commemorate this youth festival.

The Northeast Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will jointly hold a Northeast and Shenyang Youth Commemoration "May Fourth" radio conference and a week-long youth special program with the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Youth League. The broadcast will feature reports from youth role models Wei Yuxi, Hu Zhaosen, Ma Minghe, Lü Genze, and combat heroes from the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, recounting their deeds in building and defending the motherland. The radio conference will mobilize all League members and youth to better learn from the innovation spirit of young advanced producers like Wang Chonglun and strive to build the motherland. On the occasion of the "May Fourth" Youth Day, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Youth League will hold report meetings and commemorative evening parties, and organize various circles of youth for get-togethers and garden parties.

The Shanghai Heavy Industry Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will convene a meeting of more than a thousand young worker activists to commend a group of young advanced producers and call on everyone to further learn Wang Chonglun's spirit of creation and innovation and devote themselves to regular labor competitions. A city-wide youth representative get-together evening party will be held on the evening of the festival. More than a thousand students from Fudan University will hold a bonfire party with the theme of "Youths Should Contribute Everything to Socialism"; at the meeting, a swearing-in ceremony for new League members will also be held.

The youth of Tianjin are currently preparing for the festival's garden party and get-together activities. During these activities, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Youth League will organize meetings between youth role models and young people. In addition, the "Exhibition Introducing Advanced Young People," which publicizes the exemplary deeds of advanced youth in various aspects of the city, will also open on "May Fourth."

Youth in many factories, schools, organizations, and groups in Wuhan are actively rehearsing various literary and artistic programs in preparation for participating in the city-wide youth entertainment get-together evening party. Outstanding Youth League members who were commended at the recent Wuhan Municipal Youth League Congress will also meet with the vast number of young people in the city on the "May Fourth" commemoration day. The Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the Youth League will also organize a youth garden party for 25,000 people around "May Fourth."

In Chongqing, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Youth League held a "Youth Lecture" introducing the history of the "May Fourth" Movement. Representatives of all sectors of youth in Chongqing will also hold a forum to commemorate the "May Fourth" Youth Day before the festival. The Southwest Working Committee of the Youth League, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, and other units will also invite responsible comrades from the CCP Party Committee to give reports to the youth.

Youth in most factories, construction sites, schools, and organizations in Xi'an have formulated specific plans to commemorate "May Fourth." More than 600 Youth League members of the Dahua Textile Factory are now checking the advantages and disadvantages of production in April and formulating specific methods to ensure the completion of the May work plan in order to welcome their festival with practical actions. Many Hui youths are actively preparing to participate in the Hui youth ball games, singing competitions, and entertainment evening parties held by the Xi'an Hui Cultural Center during the festival. Around "May Fourth," youths from all ethnic groups and sectors in Xi'an will hold various forums and report meetings, and will invite industrial and agricultural labor models and combat heroes to participate. The city-wide youth garden party and sports performance meeting are also being actively prepared. (Xinhua News Agency)
