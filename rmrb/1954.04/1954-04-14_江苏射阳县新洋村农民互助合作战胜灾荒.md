The wheat in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, suffered from spring snow and cold currents last spring, and autumn crops were hit by drought and floods, resulting in a significant reduction in crop yields throughout the county. Yangwan Township was one of the worst-hit townships in Sheyang County, and New Yang Village was the worst-hit village in Yangwan Township. New Yang Village has 226 households with a population of 1,026. Last autumn's crops were reduced by 75%, and no household in the village was unaffected by the disaster.

After the poor autumn harvest last year, the masses in New Yang Village generally felt pessimistic and disappointed. Six of the eight mutual aid teams in the village stopped functioning, and even the relatively well-managed Hua Wengui mutual aid team asked the township head for a certificate to flee the famine. At this time, township cadres, aiming at "self-reliance in production and sticking to the local area," used the fact that disaster victims who had fled the famine in the past not only suffered but also failed to solve their livelihood problems to educate the disaster victims, pointing out that fleeing the famine was not a good solution and that the only way out was to engage in self-reliance in production locally. The township cadres also used the example of the Chen Dehua mutual aid team to illustrate the benefits of mutual aid and cooperative production for self-reliance. For example, during the drought, the Chen Dehua mutual aid team opened up the silt ditch that had not been opened for more than ten years, irrigating 43 mu of land. Everyone said: if it were not for mutual aid and cooperation, it would not have been opened for another ten years. In this way, the masses further recognized the possibility of overcoming natural disasters by organizing themselves, basically clarified the confused thoughts, reversed the pessimistic mood, and strengthened their confidence in self-reliance in production. The village quickly set off a production upsurge of fighting drought, protecting seedlings, and replanting, organized 38 waterwheels, more than 100 people to take turns drawing water, and replanted drought-resistant grains, transplanted old seedlings, and planted buckwheat, so that the general cultivated land still achieved 25% of the harvest. Because the Chen Dehua mutual aid team had a good foundation for mutual assistance and strong disaster resistance, the effect of drawing water, saving seedlings, and protecting seedlings exceeded the original individual households and temporary mutual aid teams, so it obtained more than 40% of the harvest. The whole village also sowed radishes, sweet potatoes, and vegetables; organized more than 30 people to collect more than 100 dan of Suaeda salsa seeds (substitute food); and organized several groups to engage in various sideline productions, earning more than 1.2 million yuan in September alone. The result of this mutual aid production not only made it entirely possible to overcome natural disasters, but also enabled the masses to realize the benefits of being organized from the facts. The Chen Dehua mutual aid team also formulated a plan for self-reliance in production, using the 630,000 yuan of relief funds issued by the government to the eight households in the team and the 650,000 yuan invested by other team members as production funds, rented more than 40 mu of firewood beach land to produce reed stalks (raw materials for weaving mats), and organized more than 40 people to weave mats. After a winter of active production, all team members, in addition to obtaining the means of living needed before this year's wheat harvest, also accumulated 5 million yuan as funds for spring plowing and production.

Because the masses recognized the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation in the process of self-reliance in production, and were educated by the general line, the masses in the village unanimously requested to be further organized. Now the original eight groups in the village have been restored and consolidated, and eight new mutual aid teams have been developed. At present, except for seven landlord and rich peasant households, only eight households have not joined the mutual aid team. In mid-December of last year, the village fully launched a self-reliance production campaign, which solved the difficulties in production and life for 53 households with labor but no funds; the 19 poor households with no labor and no funds also solved the difficulties in production and life because they participated in the mutual aid team. For example, Xia Shouquan, 56, and Chen Xiu, 9, and other six people, after joining the mutual aid team, did some light work such as bundling firewood and scraping firewood, and each person could get an income of about 2,000 yuan per day.

    江苏射阳县新洋村农民互助合作战胜灾荒
    江苏省射阳县去年春季小麦遭受春雪、寒流的袭击，秋季作物又遭到旱灾和水灾的侵害，全县农作物严重减产。洋湾乡是射阳县的重灾乡之一，新洋村是洋湾乡的重灾村。新洋村有二百二十六户，一千零二十六人。去年秋季作物减产百分之七十五，全村没有一家不是受灾户。
    去年秋收减产，新洋村群众普遍存在着悲观失望的情绪。全村八个互助组停顿了六个，连搞得较好的花文桂互助组也向乡长要求发给证明信外出逃荒。这时，乡干部针对这种情况，本着“生产自救、就地坚持”的方针，运用过去有的灾民外出逃荒不但受苦而且不能解决生活问题的事实，普遍地向灾民进行了教育，指出逃荒不是好办法，唯一的出路只有就地生产自救。乡干部并用陈德华互助组的事实，说明互助合作生产自救的好处。如当天旱时，陈德华互助组开通了十几年没有开通过的淤泥沟，使四十三亩田得到灌溉。大家都说：若不是互助合作，再有十年也开不通。这样，群众就进一步认识到组织起来战胜自然灾害的可能性，基本上澄清了混乱思想，扭转了悲观情绪，坚定了生产自救的信心。全村很快掀起了抗旱、保苗、改种的生产热潮，组织了三十八部水车，一百多人轮流车水，并改种旱谷，栽老秧，种荞麦，因而一般耕地还得到了二成五的收成。陈德华互助组因为互助基础好，抗灾力强，车水、救苗、保苗的效果都超过了原来的单干户和临时互助组，因而获得了四成以上的收成。全村还播种了萝卜、山芋、青菜；组织了三十多人收集盐蒿种子（代食品）一百多石；组织了几个组搞各种副业生产，仅九月份一个月就获利一百二十多万元。这样互助生产的结果，不仅完全有可能战胜灾荒，而且也使群众从事实中体会到组织起来的好处。陈德华互助组更订立了生产自救的计划，用政府发给该组八户的救济款六十三万元及其他组员投资的六十五万元作为生产资金，租了四十多亩柴滩地生产芦柴（织席的原料），组织起四十多人织席。经过一冬的积极生产，全体组员除能得到今年麦收前所需的生活资料外，还积下了五百万元作为春耕生产的资金。
    由于在生产自救过程中群众认识到互助合作的优越性，加之受到总路线的宣传教育，该村群众一致要求进一步组织起来。现在全村原有的八个组已经过恢复整顿，并新发展了八个互助组。目前除七户地主、富农外，只有八户没有参加互助组。去年十二月中旬该村全面展开了生产自救运动，解决了五十三户有劳动力无资金者在生产和生活上的困难；无劳动力、无资金的十九户困难户，也因为参加互助组而解决了生产和生活上的困难。如五十六岁的夏守权、九岁的陈秀等六人参加互助组后，做些捆柴、刮柴等轻劳动，每天每人可得到二千元左右的收入。　　（朱炯）
