The "Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition," sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, has been open in Beijing since April 15th. As of April 22nd, it has been visited by over 15,000 people. Visitors include labor models, advanced workers, engineering and technical personnel, and Party, government, trade union, and Youth League cadres from North China, Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and other regions, as well as government employees, students, and soldiers.

Representatives from various regions have gained a lot of inspiration from the exhibition. Representatives from Baoding, Handan, Shanxi, and other places are preparing to promote or test several technical innovation experiences that are applicable to their own units. Some handicraft workers, who previously thought that their work had no tricks to be found, were inspired by the creations of carpenters and bricklayers in the exhibits, and thus their creativity was awakened. Some people who previously thought that their factories were all new equipment and there was no need to improve anything, now saw that the equipment in Anshan Iron and Steel Works was newer than their own, but it greatly improved labor productivity after being improved, thus breaking conservative ideas. Some factories and mines in the past only paid attention to mobilizing veteran workers and technicians, and did not pay attention to young workers, thinking that their level was low and they could not achieve anything. After seeing that many creations were made by young workers at this exhibition, they began to change their views on young workers. Some technicians in the past did not believe in the creative wisdom of workers. After seeing that the vast majority of inventions and creations on display were made by workers, they solved the ideological problem of underestimating workers.

After visiting, soldiers, cadres, and students wrote down many observations. A soldier named Liu Hongrun wrote in the opinion book: "We have finished watching the great creations of the working class with great respect. These will forever encourage our fighting will and strengthen our determination to defend the motherland." Steel Institute students Li Wei'yi and Song Lisheng wrote: "This fully demonstrates the infinite wisdom of the working class and points out the brilliant prospects for the development of China's steel industry, strengthening our determination to dedicate ourselves to the steel industry." Xiao Kuanquan of the North China Electric Power Bureau wrote in the opinion book: "The technical innovation movement is a major event in the process of building socialism. We must turn this spirit of innovation into a driving force for the entire Chinese people to build socialism."

    “鞍钢技术革新展览会”给参观者极大启发
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会主办的“鞍钢技术革新展览会”从四月十五日在北京开幕以来，到二十二日为止，前往参观的已达一万五千多人。参观的人有来自华北、西北、内蒙古等地的劳动模范、先进工人、工程技术人员及党、政、工、团的干部，有机关干部、学生和战士等。
    各地参观代表从展览会中得到很多启发。保定、邯郸、山西等地代表均准备推广或试验若干种适用于本单位的技术革新经验。有些手工业工人过去认为自己的工作无窍门可找，这次看到展品中也有木工、瓦工的创造，因而启发了自己的创造性。有些人过去认为自己厂子都是新设备，用不着再改进什么了，现在看到鞍钢的设备比自己厂子里的还新，但经改进后大大提高了劳动生产率，因而打破了保守思想。也有些厂矿过去只注意发动老工人和技术人员，对于青年工人则不注意，认为他们水平低，搞不出什么来。这次看到许多创造都是青年工人搞成的，开始改变了对青工的看法。有些技术人员过去不相信工人的创造智慧，这次看到会上绝大部分发明创造都是工人搞出来的，因此解决了轻视工人的思想问题。
    战士、干部和学生参观后，写下了许多条观感。一位名叫刘鸿润的战士在意见簿上写道：“我们以十分崇敬的心情看完了工人阶级的伟大创造，这些将永远鼓舞着我们的战斗意志，加强了保卫祖国的决心。”钢铁学院学生李慰饴、宋丽生写道：“这充分显示了工人阶级的无穷智慧，并指出了我国钢铁工业发展的光辉远景，坚定了我们献身钢铁事业的决心。”华北电业局肖宽全在意见簿上这样写着：“技术革新运动是建设社会主义过程中的一件大事，我们要把这种革新精神变成我国全体人民建设社会主义的动力。”
