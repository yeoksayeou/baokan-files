Guizhou Province is How Publicizing the General Line to Ethnic Minorities
By our reporter Ji Xichen

    The ethnic minority compatriots living in the Miao Mountains and along the banks of the Qingshui and Dan Rivers, upon hearing that the country was implementing the general line, some were so happy that they specially went to the county and district people's governments to inquire about how the ethnic minorities should implement the general line.

    In general areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, the publicity of the general line focused on the general task proposed by the Chinese Communist Party on the national question during the transition period. This general task is: to consolidate the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and jointly build the big family of the motherland; to guarantee equality in all rights for all nationalities within the unified big family of the motherland, and to implement national regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all nationalities, to gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities between nationalities left over by history, to enable backward nationalities to join the ranks of advanced nationalities, and to gradually transition to a socialist society.

    To discuss this major issue, the Miao Autonomous Region People's Government of Lushan County convened the People's Government Committee and People's Representative Conference of the Autonomous Region at all levels; and the minority areas of Leishan County, which had not yet established autonomous regions, convened representative conferences or consultative conferences of all ethnic groups and all sectors from top to bottom at each level for discussion. Connecting their own experiences, the representatives of various nationalities, from the establishment of national regional autonomy, land reform, the organization of mutual aid and cooperation, the development of production, government loans of grain and funds, the distribution of free agricultural implements, relief grain, and relief winter clothing; from the series of facts that state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives supplied various daily necessities at low prices and purchased various local specialties at preferential prices, deeply realized that every measure and every reform of the Party and the People's Government for the ethnic minorities was "the staircase built by Chairman Mao for us to move towards happiness." Before liberation, about 100,000 ethnic minorities in Lushan County had 50% of the population digging and eating "fern roots" on the mountains every spring. Now, not only does each person have an average of 577 kilograms of grain per year, but they can also eat an average of 17 kilograms of pork (excluding suicide). In the past, because they could not get salt, adults had to soak white stones in bowls to coax crying children. Now, each person can eat an average of more than ten kilograms of salt a year. In the past, farmers could only exchange 50 kilograms of salt for 100 kilograms of baked tobacco. Now they can exchange 234 kilograms of salt. In the past, buying a bolt of white cloth required 1,480 kilograms of rice. Now, the price of cloth has been reduced by more than half compared to the past. Each person can wear more than two zhang of cloth a year, and every household has sewn new clothes. More than 9,700 children of workers and peasants who had never attended school are now entering ethnic schools, which have increased sevenfold compared to 1950. In the past four years, more than 100,000 ethnic minority compatriots have received free medical care. The representatives recognized the help given by the motherland to the ethnic minorities with the facts they saw in real life. After comparison, calculation, and discussion, the thinking of the representatives of various nationalities and leaders was generally improved, the direction of progress was clarified, and they realized that the ethnic minorities had gained these benefits due to the victory of the Party's general line, due to the development of industry in the motherland, and due to the increase of socialist factors in the country. In this way, the specific content of the general line was combined with the vital interests of the ethnic minorities, further clarifying the reason and necessity for implementing the general line, and expressing infinite love and trust for Chairman Mao and the Party's general line, praising Chairman Mao as "the sun on cloudy days," "the rain on dry days," and "the parents of all nationalities," saying that the general line is "Chairman Mao lighting a lamp in our hearts, making both big and small roads bright!"

    After discussion, not only did the ethnic minorities love the construction of the motherland more, but they also saw the prospects of the various nationalities in the great socialist motherland in the future. They were full of confidence and unanimously supported the Party's general line during the transition period. A Miao representative said: "Hei! Jiu ge su, nai na hai jiao ge hei!" (meaning: This is the best road, we must take the new road!)

    To publicize the general line to ethnic minorities, it is necessary to use various appropriate national forms to deeply integrate patriotism and socialist education into the ethnic minority masses. Among the national forms, what is decisive is to carry out propaganda through ethnic minority cadres using their own languages. Comrade Jiang Qingrong (Miao nationality), deputy secretary of the Wanchao District Committee of the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, organized nine Party members, eighteen League members, and thirty-six propagandists from the ethnic minorities into seven ethnic propaganda teams while working in Daba Township, and publicized to the masses from village to village in their own languages for more than half a month, according to the characteristics of the ethnic minorities. They connected the liberation of the ethnic minorities, the current construction of the autonomous region, and the joint construction of the socialist motherland to carry out propaganda to the masses, so that all men, women, and children in the township were universally educated in patriotism and socialism. When the masses understood that supporting the construction of the motherland was also accelerating the construction of their own ethnic minorities, and that selling surplus grain was patriotism and helping to develop industry, the masses automatically launched a wave of selling "glorious grain" and "patriotic grain," selling more than 172,000 kilograms of surplus grain in five days. In addition, many places also used ethnic festivals such as "eating Guzang" (ancestor worship), "eating new" (celebrating harvest), and "dancing flower," and the "naozhai" and "naojia" forms of daily natural gatherings of the masses to convene "elderly meetings," "women's meetings," and "family meetings" respectively. In many places in Lushan Kairi District, the opportunity of "dancing Lusheng" and "rocking Malang" for young men and women was also used to incorporate the content of the country's implementation of socialist industrialization, the organization of mutual aid and cooperation in areas with conditions, and the current central work into the most popular songs of the Miao masses, which had a great effect on carrying out socialist education in conjunction with the daily life of the masses.

    At first, some people misunderstood the socialist industrialization of the motherland. They thought, how can we know about industrialization when we can't see factories and machines here, and we can't see electric lights and telephones? Later, the cadres linked the current examples and guided the masses to educate themselves on the benefits of the country's socialist industrialization to the ethnic minorities based on their own experiences. The ethnic minorities living in Maoping Township on Leigong Mountain had to "slash and burn" because of the lack of cattle and farm tools, and women had to use their feet as plows to cultivate the land. In the past, 92 households did not know how to use cattle to plow the land. Now the People's Government has loaned 66 cattle to help them buy, and also distributed more than 320 free agricultural implements. Under the education of the cadres, the masses gradually learned to use cattle to plow the land, so that the backward production methods have been initially changed. The masses realized where the farm implements came from by associating with them. If the working class brothers did not produce steel and manufacture agricultural implements, "wouldn't we still have to step on the mud with our feet!" Production Committee member Li Zhenglin said: "What we Miao people didn't have in the past, we have now. What was poor in the past is now rich. What was backward in the past is now advanced. If the country hadn't developed industry, how could our production and life have such a big change!"

    The masses deeply realized the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation from calculating the increase in agricultural production, and realized that only by carrying out agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation can the ethnic minorities get rid of poverty and become rich together. The model mutual aid group of Zhang Mingliang in the southwest district of Lushan County (consisting of 11 ethnic minority households, including 8 Miao households) had a total income of economic crops and food crops equivalent to 97,900 kilograms of rice in 1953, an increase of 53% compared to 63,900 kilograms in 1952, and an increase of 127% compared to 1951. Because the mutual aid group constantly improved cultivation, the average yield per mu of the whole group reached 705 kilograms (9 mu yielded 1,047 kilograms). As agricultural production increased, the purchasing power per capita of the whole group increased from 72,000 yuan in 1951 to 215,000 yuan in 1953. Eight of the eleven poor and hired peasants have now all risen to the level of middle peasants. Group member Wu Shiqing said to people: "When I pick up the rice bowl, I think of Chairman Mao. When I carry the grain on my shoulders, I think of the mutual aid group. Whoever wants to live a good life should take the road of mutual aid and cooperation!" After studying the general line, 42 ethnic minority households from Zhang Mingliang's mutual aid group and two other perennial mutual aid groups voluntarily formed the "Dashanlin Agricultural Production Cooperative." When the news that they planned to increase grain production by 120,000 kilograms in 1954 compared to last year (equivalent to more than 60,000 kilograms of economic crops) reached various places in Lushan, the masses were all excited and said: "Follow Zhang Mingliang, he is taking the road to socialism!"

    Under the publicity and encouragement of the general line, the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and expand production was unprecedentedly high, and they started preparing for spring plowing ahead of schedule. Lushan County, based on the inherent "exchange labor" habit of the ethnic minorities, united the "work leaders" ("work leaders" are natural leaders who lead production in Miao customs), village elders, and village leaders, relied on production activists, and started from the local ethnic characteristics to overcome the tendencies of being impetuous, rash, and compulsory, and cautiously and steadily developed mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In one year, 1,515 mutual aid groups were established, and the organized farmers reached 53% of the total number of households. The ethnic minorities in Leishan County never had the habit of winter plowing, and never sowed wheat. Last year, they winter-plowed more than 3 million mu of paddy fields, sowed more than 20,000 mu of wheat, and also repaired nearly 1 million mu of field ridges. After repairing various ditches and ponds, nearly 3,000 mu of sloping land have been transformed into terraced fields, and dry fields have been transformed into paddy fields. More than 10,000 farmers have burned an average of 700 kilograms of plant ash per household, and fertilizer has been generally increased. In Baode Township, Xianglou Township and other places, the masses have sent 50% of the fertilizer to the ground before and after the Spring Festival and started sowing potatoes and baked tobacco.

    After the propaganda of the general line, the unity of nationalities has been further strengthened, thus solving problems that could not be solved well in the past. Within the Miao nationality in Datang Township, the third district of Leishan County, disputes often arose in the past due to the selection of "work leaders." When publicizing the general line, the cadres of the area led the masses to combine the inspection of national policies and convened a consultative conference. After three days of discussion, Wang Shagao and Wang Qirong were elected as "work leaders," strengthening the internal unity of the nationality. Jin Wanglong of Zhan Diao Village said: "Now we will not have any more disputes. In the old society, I don't know how many lawsuits we would have to file!" In Longtouhe Village, Kaili, Lushan County, after liberation, farmers of all ethnic groups organized mutual aid groups together and helped each other develop production, which not only enhanced the unity among ethnic minorities, but also further enhanced the friendship with the Han people, and recognized the advanced role and leadership role of the Han nationality in building the big family of the motherland. Miao Pan Zhiying said: "What industrial products we use, which one is not made by the Han working class brothers? Without the help of the Han nationality, how could we Miao people have today's happiness!" Therefore, they also followed the example of the Han nationality in actively helping and taking care of other ethnic minorities living in the village. Recently, an agricultural production cooperative including three ethnic components was established in the village. At the celebration of the establishment of the cooperative, an ethnic minority farmer said: "Our nationalities must unite as one and take the socialist road."

    贵州省是怎样向少数民族宣传总路线的
    本报记者　纪希晨
    居住在苗岭山脉间和清水江、丹江两岸的少数民族同胞，听到国家实行总路线了，有些人高兴得特地跑到县区人民政府询问少数民族怎样实行总路线。
    在一般少数民族聚居的地方，宣传总路线时，都着重宣传了过渡时期中国共产党在民族问题方面所提出的总任务。这个总任务是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间的事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。
    为讨论这件大事，炉山县苗族自治区人民政府，召开了自治区各级人民政府委员会和人民代表会议；而尚未建立自治区的雷山县少数民族聚居区，则自上而下，层层召开了各族各界代表会议或协商会议，进行讨论。各民族代表联系本民族的切身经验，从建立民族区域自治，土地改革，组织互助合作，发展生产，政府贷粮贷款，发放无偿农具、救济粮、救济寒衣；从国营商业、供销合作社廉价供应各种生活必需品，优价收购各种土特产品的一系列事实中，深切认识到党和人民政府对少数民族的每一措施，每一改革，都是“毛主席给我们搭起的走向幸福的楼梯”。解放前，炉山县十万左右少数民族，每年春天都有百分之五十的人口到山上挖吃“蕨巴根”，现在不仅每人每年平均有五百七十七斤粮食，而且还能平均吃上猪肉十七斤（自杀自食不在内）。过去因为吃不到盐巴，孩子哭闹时，大人不得不把白石头泡到碗中去欺哄哭闹着的孩子，现在每人一年都可平均吃到十几斤盐巴了。解放前，农民卖一百斤烤烟只能换盐五十斤，现在能换盐二百三十四斤。过去，买一匹白布需米一千四百八十斤，现在布价比过去减低一半多，每人一年平均可穿布两丈多，家家户户都缝了新衣服。从来没有上过学的工农子弟，现在有九千七百多人进入民族学校，学校比一九五○年增加了七倍。受到免费医疗的少数民族同胞，四年来达十万余人。代表们以现实生活中亲眼看到的事实，认识到祖国大家庭给少数民族的帮助。经过对比算账讨论，各族代表和领袖人物，思想普遍得到提高，明确了前进的方向，认识了少数民族所以得到这些利益是由于党的总路线的胜利，是由于祖国发展了工业，是由于国家社会主义因素的增涨。这样，便把总路线的具体内容，和少数民族的切身利益结合了起来，使大家进一步明确了贯彻执行总路线的道理与必要，对毛主席、对党的总路线表现无限的热爱和信任，称颂毛主席是“阴天的太阳”、“旱天的雨”、“各民族的父母亲”，说总路线是“毛主席在我们心上点起一盏灯，大路小路亮通通！”
    经过讨论，不仅使少数民族更加热爱祖国大家庭的建设事业，而且看到了各民族在将来伟大社会主义祖国大家庭中的远景，他们充满了信心，一致拥护党在过渡时期的总路线。苗族代表说：“嘿?！玖格素，乃那海胶格嘿！”（意思是说：这是一条最好的道路，我们一定要走新道路！）
    向少数民族宣传总路线，必须通过各种适当的民族形式，才能使爱国主义与社会主义教育深入到少数民族群众中去。民族形式中，具有决定意义的是通过少数民族干部运用少数民族自己的语言去进行宣传。中共炉山县万潮区区委副书记姜庆荣同志（苗族），在大坝乡工作时根据少数民族特点，将少数民族中的九个党员、十八个团员和三十六个宣传员，组织成七个民族宣传队，用本民族语言，挨村挨户地向群众宣传了半个多月。他们把少数民族的解放、当前自治区的建设，和共同建设社会主义祖国大家庭联系起来向群众进行宣传，使全乡男女老少，普遍受到了爱国主义和社会主义教育。当群众明白了支援祖国建设也就是加速少数民族自己的建设，卖余粮就是爱国、就是帮助发展工业的时候，群众自动掀起售“光荣粮”、“爱国粮”的热潮，五天之内售出余粮十七万二千余斤。此外，许多地方还利用“吃牯藏”（祭祖）、“吃新”（庆丰收）、“跳花”等民族节日，利用群众每日自然聚会的“闹寨”、“闹家”形式，分别召开“老年会”、“妇女会”和“家庭会议”。炉山凯里区不少地方，还利用男女青年的“跳籚笙”、“摇马郎”的机会，把国家实行社会主义工业化、有条件的地区组织互助合作和当前的中心工作等内容，编入苗族群众最流行的歌曲中，对结合群众日常生活进行社会主义教育，收到很大效果。
    对于祖国的社会主义工业化，起初有些人存有误解。他们认为我们这里看不到工厂和机器，也看不到电灯和电话，怎能知道工业化呀？后来，干部联系当前实例，引导群众根据自己切身体验，教育群众认识国家社会主义工业化对少数民族的好处。住在雷公山上茅坪乡的少数民族，过去因为缺乏耕牛、农具，不得不“刀耕火种”，不得不让妇女用脚当犁耙来耕田，九十二户人家过去全不会用耕牛犁田。现在人民政府贷款帮助买耕牛六十六条，还发放各种无偿农具三百二十多件；在干部教育下群众逐渐学会用牛耕田，使落后的生产方法初步得到改变。群众由联想农具从何而来，认识到如果不是工人老大哥生产钢铁，制造农具，“我们还不是要两只脚踩泥巴！”生产委员李正林说：“我们苗家过去没有的，现在有了，过去贫穷的，现在富裕了，过去落后的，现在进步了，如果不是国家发展了工业，我们的生产和生活那会有这样大的变化！”
    群众从算农业增产账中，深切体会到互助合作的优越性，认识到只有开展农业生产互助合作，才能使少数民族摆脱贫困，共同富裕。炉山县西南区丰产模范张明亮互助组（共十一户少数民族，内八户苗族）。一九五三年经济作物和粮食作物总收入合水稻九万七千九百斤，较一九五二年六万三千九百斤增加百分之五十三，比一九五一年增产了百分之一百二十七。由于互助组不断改进耕作，全组每亩平均产量达七百零五斤，（有九亩产量达一千零四十七斤）随着农业产量增加，全组每口人的购买力，已由一九五一年的七万二千元，提高到一九五三年的二十一万五千元。十一户中的八户贫雇农，现在已全部上升为中农。组员吴世清对人说：“我端起饭碗就想起毛主席，谷子挑在肩上就想起互助组。谁想日子过的好，谁就要走互助合作这条路！”经过学习总路线，现在张明亮互助组和其他两个常年互助组的四十二户少数民族，自愿组成了“大山林农业生产合作社”。当他们计划一九五四年比去年再增产粮食十二万斤的消息，（经济作物折合六万余斤）传到炉山各地的时候，群众都振奋的说：“跟着张明亮走吧，他走的就是到社会主义的路啊！”
    在总路线的宣传鼓舞下，群众参加互助合作运动和扩大生产的积极性空前高涨，纷纷提前进行春耕准备工作。炉山县根据少数民族中固有的“换活路”的习惯，团结“活路头”（“活路头”是苗族风俗习惯中，领导生产的自然领袖）、乡老、寨老，依靠生产积极分子，从当地民族特点出发，及时克服急躁冒进和强迫命令的倾向，慎重稳步地发展互助合作组织；一年来建立互助组一千五百一十五个，组织起来的农户已达总户数的百分之五十三。雷山县少数民族从来没有冬耕习惯，也从不播种小麦，去年冬耕三百多万亩水田，播种小麦两万余亩，另外并整修了将近一百万亩的田坎。在补修兴修各种水沟堰塘后，已有近三千亩坡土变梯田，干田变水田。一万多农户每家都平均烧草木灰七百斤，普遍增加了肥料，报德乡、响楼乡等地群众，春节前后已把百分之五十的肥料送到地中，开始播种马铃薯、烤烟。
      经过总路线的宣传，进一步加强了民族团结，从而解决了过去未能很好解决的问题。雷山县第三区大塘乡苗族内部，过去曾因“活路头”的人选问题时常引起纠纷。宣传总路线时，该地干部领导群众结合检查民族政策，召开了的协商会议，经过三天讨论，选举王沙高和王其荣任“活路头”，加强了民族内部的团结。斩刁村金望龙说：“这下子我们可不会再起纠纷了。要在旧社会，不知要打多少官司呢！”炉山县凯里龙头河村，解放后各族农民在共同组织互助组，相互帮助发展生产中，不仅增强了少数民族间的团结，而且也进一步增强了与汉族人民的友谊，认识了汉族在建设祖国的大家庭中的先进作用与领导作用。苗族潘志英说：“我们用的工业品，那一样不是汉族工人老大哥给制造的？如果没有汉族的帮助，我们苗家那会有今天的幸福！”因而对于居住村内的其他少数民族，也多仿照汉族对他们的榜样，采取积极帮助和主动照顾的态度。最近该村成立了一个包括三个民族成分的农业生产合作社。在庆祝合作社成立时，一个少数民族农民说：“我们各民族一定要团结一心，走社会主义的大路。”
