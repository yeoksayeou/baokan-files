    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 1st, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, recently sent a telegram congratulating the People's Army, local People's Army units, militias, and guerrillas who performed meritorious service in the spring offensive in South Vietnam.

    The congratulatory telegram stated that in the first three months of this year, while the People's Army achieved victories on all fronts in North and Central Vietnam, you actively conducted guerrilla warfare and launched political offensives against the enemy in South Vietnam, removing and forcing the enemy to withdraw from more than 300 strongholds and watchtowers, and severely threatening the enemy's land and water transportation, causing the enemy to suffer great losses. The victories you have achieved on the battlefields in the eastern and western regions of South Vietnam, especially in the provinces of Ben Tre and My Tho, demonstrate the fighting spirit and significant progress of our South Vietnamese military and civilians. These victories greatly encourage the cadres and soldiers of the People's Army on other fronts – especially Dien Bien Phu and Highway 5.

    In conclusion, General Vo Nguyen Giap, on behalf of the General Headquarters of the People's Army, extended warm congratulations to all the soldiers in South Vietnam and called on them to work hard to consolidate and expand the guerrilla zones and guerrilla bases, accelerate the establishment of people's armed forces, and strive for new victories.

    越南人民军总司令武元甲电贺南越春季作战有功部队
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社一日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军最近电贺春季在南越作战有功的人民军、人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队。
    贺电说，在今年头三个月中，和人民军在北越、中越各战线上获得胜利同时，你们在南越积极地进行了游击战并对敌军展开政治攻势，拔除和迫使敌人撤离了三百多个据点和了望塔，并且严重地威胁了敌人的水陆交通，使敌人遭受很大的损失。你们在南越东部和西部地区的战线上、特别是槟椥和美萩两省的战线上所获得的胜利，表现出我们南越军民的战斗精神和显著的进步。这些胜利大大地鼓舞着其他各战线——特别是奠边府和第五号公路上的人民军干部和战士。
    武元甲将军最后代表人民军总司令部向南越全体战士致热烈的祝贺，并号召他们努力巩固与扩大游击区和游击根据地，加速建立人民武装，争取新的胜利。
