    At the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, April 2 Meeting
    Otto Grotewohl's Speech
    Comrade Otto Grotewohl delivered a speech at the evening session of the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on April 2. He began by saying that the summary report of the Central Committee of the Party to the Congress is proof of the transformative power of the workers and peasants of the German Democratic Republic, a power closely linked to the theory of Marxism-Leninism. Grotewohl said that the working class plays a leading role in the German Democratic Republic. Of the 6.1 million working people in the German Democratic Republic, 4.5 million are workers. Together with their families, workers make up more than half of the Republic's total population. This alone demonstrates the particularly important role the working class plays in the life of the German Democratic Republic.
    Workers create all material wealth through their labor, but this alone is not enough to fully explain the role of the working class in the German Democratic Republic. After all, workers and their families also make up the vast majority of residents in West Germany. They too create the main wealth of society through their labor. However, the working class in West Germany does not play a leading role in social life as it does in the German Democratic Republic. The most important thing is that in the German Democratic Republic, most of the economy and all state power belong to the working class, allied with the working peasantry and in close cooperation with all progressive people (scientists, technical experts, and artists), while in West Germany, economic power and state power, as before, belong to the big capitalists and landlords.
    Grotewohl continued that the leading role of the working class in the German Democratic Republic is primarily manifested in the fact that the working class's party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—is the most powerful ruling party in the German Democratic Republic. This party takes Marxist-Leninist theory as its guide, applies it in practice, and cooperates with politically progressive people from anti-fascist democratic groups.
    Speaking about the characteristics of the state power in the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl said that the workers in the German Democratic Republic are no longer the objects of exploitation by big capitalists. The working people know that this new state is their own, and their destiny is linked to it. Therefore, the working people—workers and peasants—are the basic representatives of state power.
    Grotewohl then spoke in detail about the work of the state organs in the German Democratic Republic. After explaining that more than two-thirds of the Republic's administrative organs are composed of workers and peasants, Grotewohl emphasized that, unlike any bourgeois state organ, the state organs of the German Democratic Republic have close ties with the broad masses of working people. He said that there are many mistakes in the work of our state organs, and serious mistakes at that. However, we are exposing these mistakes and eliminating them. Grotewohl said that in the work of many of our ministries and departments, there are still shortcomings such as bureaucracy, red tape, procrastination, and a lack of concern for people. He said that these bad work methods must be overcome. Grotewohl told the workers who had been transferred from factories to work in the state administrative organs: Workers should maintain a high level of class consciousness wherever they work. Grotewohl said: "Don't become an 'organ-type' worker, but always be a worker in the organs!" The whole audience responded with thunderous applause. Grotewohl went on to say that we were cultivated by the working class. We were forged by the working class, so whether we are on tractors, next to machines, or at desks in government departments, we must always be people who serve socialism wholeheartedly. Grotewohl pointed out that concern for people should become the focus of attention in all state administration work. He went on to say that after this congress, the law on the personal responsibility of all staff in state administrative organs should become an unshakable law.
    Grotewohl mentioned Comrade Mikoyan's congratulatory message to the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "The theory and practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union greatly help the people of other countries build a free life." Grotewohl said: This is correct, and we have learned this from our own experience. American soldiers are training German youth in West Germany to use rapid-firing cannons, while Soviet rapid-speed lathe operators are coming to our enterprises to help our workers master the work methods of peaceful labor. Soviet and German workers, peasants, scientists, technical experts, and artists are visiting each other and effectively exchanging experiences. The combination of Marxist theory and Marxist practice (as manifested in many aspects) confirms the slogan: "Learning from the Soviet Union means learning how to achieve victory!" I think we should continue to do this, and do it even more widely. (Applause)
    The development process of the Soviet Union proves that Marx's argument is correct: that the conscious activity of the people under socialism is of a mass character, and it is the guarantee of the victory of the working class. The victory of the Soviet workers is also of particular significance for the German working class, raising the class consciousness and organization of the German working class to a higher level. On the scientific basis of Marxism-Leninism, the German working class has established the unity of the workers' movement on one-third of its territory, created the Socialist Unity Party, a revolutionary and disciplined tool for struggle, established its own state, and carried out a genuine revolutionary transformation of social relations in just a few years. After the founding of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, for the first time in German history, a peace-loving and democratic German state was born.
    With the help of the Soviet Union, the Party and the government adopted a new policy, increasing investment in light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, and adopting measures to increase the production of consumer goods, reduce prices, reduce taxes, and reduce other burdens to improve the living standards of the working people. In the past four years, our country has proven that it is capable of leading the people confidently and victoriously. The close alliance between the working class and the working peasantry is a solid and reliable foundation. For the first time in German history, there is a democratic system under which the working people—the legitimate and responsible representatives of power in our country—consciously assume the responsibility of leading the country.
    Grotewohl then spoke about the resolution made by the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party on the need to cultivate socialist consciousness among the working class and the broad masses of working people in the German Democratic Republic. He emphasized that the resolution made at that congress on building the foundations of socialism in the German Democratic Republic could only be realized if the Party tirelessly instilled in the masses the knowledge of building socialism, taught them how to manage the state, and cultivated their high revolutionary vigilance against the destructive and harmful activities of the enemy.
    Grotewohl continued, saying that the German working class bears a great historical task. In the German people's national struggle for the unification of Germany on a democratic basis and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the role of the German working class is of particular significance. The American monopoly capitalists and their German lackeys disregard the will of the German people and trample on the national interests of the German people. This will not bring them any benefit. We fight for the cause of the people and for world peace. Therefore, the people understand us; therefore, our cause will surely triumph! (Thunderous applause) As the West German proletariat constantly gains experience in daily class struggles, and as they become familiar with the economic structure and social life of the German Democratic Republic, the class consciousness of the West German working people is constantly improving, and they are increasingly recognizing that their task is to unite with the workers of the Social Democratic Party, as well as with Catholic and non-party workers, to achieve our national goals through joint action. Therefore, the task of implementing the new policy and making the German Democratic Republic a convincing example for our West German compatriots is of the utmost importance.
    How quickly this new policy is implemented will depend primarily on the policies of the Party and the government, and on the extent to which the Party and the government raise the new socialist consciousness of our citizens. Therefore, the Party and state workers of the German Democratic Republic should be extremely sensitive and attentive to the growing demands of the working people. The propaganda and agitation we conduct in our Republic and in West Germany should not be divorced from reality and life, but should be carried out concretely.
    Grotewohl pointed out that the working class of the German Democratic Republic, as a whole, has not yet realized that it is the ruling class, and has not yet completely shaken off the influence of bourgeois ideology. He said that the working people of the German Democratic Republic live in a transitional period, living in a class society where hostile bourgeois ideology continues to influence them. Many former Nazis, state officials, officers, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements, after the crushing of the Hitler fascist regime, also joined our enterprises as workers. These people, as well as some other workers, are still influenced by the slanderous propaganda of the enemies of the German people, and often bring bourgeois ideas into the working class. To make socialist ideas penetrate deeply into the hearts and minds of the majority of the working class, and to wage a resolute struggle against all manifestations of bourgeois ideology—this is the task of the Party and the government. As the masses increasingly realize that their country is truly and constantly defending their interests, they will also understand their own responsibilities and make their own contributions to further strengthening and developing the country.
    Grotewohl mentioned the sentence in Comrade A. I. Mikoyan's congratulatory message to the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "Our most important issue at present is the issue of peace and the security of the people of all countries."
    Grotewohl emphasized at the end of his speech that the Soviet Union is always advancing along the road of guaranteeing peace and the security of the people of all countries, and this road is also correct for Germany. Regarding this point, he pointed out the document submitted by the Central Committee of the Party to the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany for review—"The Road to Solving the Vital Problems of the German Nation." This document states: "All measures must be taken to unite the workers of the two parts of Germany, because maintaining peace and the future of Germany depend on the cooperation and unity of action of the German working class. It is necessary to confront the militarist groups formed in West Germany under the leadership of the ruling parties in Bonn with the group of workers—all Social Democratic Party members, Communist Party members, trade union members, non-party workers, and Christian workers. Only when the social life of Germany is determined by the power of millions of working people can all the most important vital problems of the German nation be solved."

    在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会四月二日会议上
    奥托·格罗提渥发表的演说
    奥托·格罗提渥同志在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会四月二日晚间会议上发表演说。他首先说，已向党代表大会作过的党中央委员会总结报告是证明德意志民主共和国的工人和农民具有何等的改造力量，这种力量是和马克思—列宁主义理论密切结合的结果。格罗提渥说，工人阶级在德意志民主共和国里起着领导作用。在德意志民主共和国的六百一十万劳动人民中有四百五十万是工人。连同家属一起，工人人数占共和国总人口的一半以上。这一点就已经说明了工人阶级在德意志民主共和国生活中所起的特别重要的作用。
    工人们用自己的劳动创造了一切物质财富，但是，光是这些还不足以充分说明工人阶级在德意志民主共和国所起的作用。要知道西德的工人和眷属也占居民的绝大多数。他们也用自己的劳动创造社会的主要财富。但是，工人阶级在西德并不像工人阶级在德意志民主共和国那样，在社会生活中起领导作用。最主要的是，在德意志民主共和国，大部分经济和全部国家政权是属于跟劳动农民结成联盟并跟全体进步人士（科学家、技术专家和艺术工作者）紧密合作的工人阶级的，而在西德，经济权和国家政权和以往一样是属于大资本家和地主的。
    格罗提渥接着说，工人阶级在德意志民主共和国的领导作用首先表现在工人阶级的党——德国统一社会党——在德意志民主共和国是最强有力的执政党。这个党以马克思—列宁学说为指南，把它运用于实际，同时和反法西斯民主集团的政治上进步的人士合作。
    格罗提渥谈到德意志民主共和国的国家政权的特征时说，德意志民主共和国的工人已不再是大资本家剥削的对象。劳动人民知道，这个新国家是他们自己的国家，他们的命运是和这个国家联系在一起的。因此，劳动人民——工人和农民——是国家政权的基本代表。
    格罗提渥接着详细谈到德意志民主共和国国家机关的工作。格罗提渥说明共和国管理机关三分之二以上由工农组成之后，着重指出，德意志民主共和国国家机关和任何资产阶级的国家机关相反，是和广大劳动群众有千丝万缕的联系的。他说，在我们国家机关工作中有许多错误，而且有严重的错误。但是，我们正在揭发这些错误，消除这些错误。格罗提渥说，在我们许多部、处的工作中仍然存在着这样一些缺点：官僚主义，文牍主义，拖沓作风，不关心人。他说，这些恶劣的工作方法必须加以克服。格罗提渥向从工厂调到国家管理机关工作的工人说：工人们无论在什么地方工作，都应当保持高度的阶级觉悟。格罗提渥说：“不要变成机关式的工人，而要在机关里永远做一个工人！”于是全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。格罗提渥接着说，我们是工人阶级培养出来的。我们是工人阶级铸造出来的，那么我们无论是在拖拉机上，在机器旁边，在政府各部的办公桌上，都要永远做全心全意为社会主义服务的人。格罗提渥指出，对人的关怀应当成为管理国家的全部工作的注意中心。他接着说，这次代表大会之后，关于国家管理机关全体工作人员个人责任制的法律应当成为不可动摇的法律。
    格罗提渥提到米高扬同志在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会上所作的贺词中的一句话：“苏联社会主义建设的理论和实践大大有助于其他各国人民建设自由生活。”格罗提渥说：这是正确的，我们已经从自己的经验中体会到了这一点。美国士兵在西德训练德国青年使用速射炮，而苏联的快速车工到我们的企业帮助我们工人掌握和平劳动的工作法。苏联和德国的工人、农民、科学家、技术专家和艺术工作者互相访问和有效地交换经验。马克思主义理论和马克思主义实践的结合（这表现在许多方面）证实了这一口号：“学习苏联，就是学习如何取得胜利！”我认为，我们应当继续这样做，并更加广泛地这样做。（掌声）
    苏联的发展过程证明马克思的这一论点是对的，即：人民的自觉的活动在社会主义的条件下是具有群众性的，它是工人阶级胜利的保证。苏联工人的胜利对于德国工人阶级也具有特别重大意义的，它把德国工人阶级的阶级觉悟和组织性提到了更高的高度。在马克思—列宁主义的科学基础上，德国工人阶级在自己三分之一的领土上建立了工人运动的统一，创立了统一社会党这个革命的有纪律的斗争工具，建立了自己的国家并在几年当中对社会关系进行了真正的革命改造。一九四九年德意志民主共和国成立后，在德国历史上第一次诞生了一个爱好和平的民主的德意志国家。
    党和政府在苏联的帮助下采取了新的方针，增加对轻工业、食品工业和农业的投资，采取了增加消费品产量、以减低物价和缩减税收及缩减其他负担的方法提高劳动人民生活水平的方针。在过去四年中，我们国家已经证明，它是能够有把握地和胜利地领导人民的。工人阶级与劳动农民的紧密联盟是一个巩固的和可靠的基础。在德国历史上第一次有了民主制度，在民主制度下，劳动人民——我们国家的合法的负责的政权代表——自觉地担当起领导国家的责任。
    格罗提渥接着谈到统一社会党第二次代表会议所作的关于必须在德意志民主共和国工人阶级和广大劳动群众当中培养社会主义意识的决议。他强调说，那次会议所作的关于在德意志民主共和国建立社会主义基础的决议，只有在这种情况下才可能实现，即：党要不倦地向群众灌输建设社会主义的知识，教会他们管理国家，培养他们对敌人的破坏活动和危害活动保持高度的革命警惕性。
    格罗提渥继续说，德国工人阶级负有巨大的历史任务。在德国人民为在民主的基础上统一德国和为缔结对德和约而进行的民族斗争中，德国工人阶级的作用具有特别的意义。美国垄断资本家和他们的德国走狗置德国人民的意志于不顾，蹂躏德国人民的民族利益。这决不会带给他们任何利益。我们为人民的事业、为世界和平而斗争。因此，人民了解我们；因此，我们的事业一定胜利！（暴风雨般的掌声）由于西德无产阶级在日常的阶级斗争中不断获得经验，由于他们熟悉了德意志民主共和国的经济结构和社会生活，西德劳动人民的阶级觉悟正在不断提高，他们日益认识到：他们的任务就是和社会民主党的工人以及和天主教与无党派的工人联合起来，以共同的行动来达到我们的民族目标。因此，实现新的方针，使德意志民主共和国成为我们西德同胞可以信服的榜样这项任务就具有最重大的意义。
    实现这个新方针的速度如何，首先就将依靠于党和政府的政策，依靠于党和政府提高我们公民的新的社会主义觉悟的程度。因此，德意志民主共和国的党和国家的工作人员对于劳动人民日益增长的要求应当极其敏感和注意。在我们本共和国以及在西德进行的宣传鼓动，不应当脱离现实，脱离生活，而应当具体进行。
    格罗提渥指出：德意志民主共和国工人阶级，整个来说，还没有认识到自己是统治阶级，还没有完全摆脱资产阶级的思想意识影响，他并说：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民生活在过渡时期的情况下，生活在敌对的资产阶级思想意识仍在继续影响他们的阶级社会中。许多从前的纳粹分子、国家职员、军官、资产阶级和小资产阶级分子，在希特勒法西斯政权被粉碎后，也作为工人参加到我们的企业中来了，这些人以及另外一些工人还受着德国人民的敌人的诽谤宣传的影响，并且经常把资产阶级的思想带到工人阶级中来。使社会主义思想深入工人阶级大多数人的心中和思想中，与资产阶级思想的一切表现进行坚决的斗争——这就是党和政府的任务。随着群众越来越认识到他们的国家是真正地经常保卫着他们的利益，他们也将会了解他们自己的责任，并在进一步加强和发展国家的事业内作出自己的贡献。
    格罗提渥提到阿·伊·米高扬同志在给德国统一社会党第四次代表大会的贺词中所说的一句话：“我们当前最主要的问题是和平与世界各国人民的安全问题。”
    格罗提渥在演说的结尾强调指出：苏联始终是在沿着保障和平与各国人民的安全的道路前进，这一道路对德国来讲也是正确的。关于这一点，他指出了党中央委员会提交德国统一社会党第四次代表大会审查的文件——“解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路”。这个文件中说道：“必须采取一切措施，使德国两部分的工人联合起来，因为保持和平和德国的前途有赖于德国工人阶级的合作和行动的一致。必须以工人集团——所有的社会民主党党员、共产党党员、工会会员、无党派工人与基督教工人的集团，与在波恩各执政党的领导下在西德所组成的军国主义集团对抗。只有当德国的社会生活决定于千百万劳动人民的力量时，德意志民族的一切最重要的切身问题才能够解决。”
