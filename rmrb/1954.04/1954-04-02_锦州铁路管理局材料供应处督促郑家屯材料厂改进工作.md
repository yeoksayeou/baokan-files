Jinzhou Railway Administration Materials Supply Department's letter: After the "Reader's Letter Summary" column published the letter "Why Does Zhengjiatun Railway Materials Factory Treat Good Materials as Scrap" on January 27, we immediately sent Director Inspector Zhang Huimin to the factory for inspection. The results proved that the reader's criticism was completely correct. When disposing of the original stock of old rail spikes, the factory did not conduct a careful inspection, and a large portion of good rail spikes were treated as scrap iron. When the engineering section requested mutual exchange and utilization, the factory still did not correct its mistake in a timely manner and instead dealt with it in an evasive manner. When disposing of old bridge sleepers, the factory did not consult with higher authorities regarding the availability of these sleepers, but instead arbitrarily treated them as firewood. The above facts show that the leading cadres of the factory lacked a responsible attitude towards state materials. We should also bear considerable responsibility for insufficient inspection of the factory's work. During this inspection, we also discovered confusion in the factory's supply and material receiving and issuing systems. Therefore, we have decided to not only criticize and educate the factory's leading cadres, but also to add a factory director to strengthen leadership. In addition, we will circulate the problems in the factory's work to all affiliated factories to draw widespread attention, and we will conduct regular supervision and inspection of the work of each factory in the future to discover problems and correct errors in a timely manner.

    锦州铁路管理局材料供应处督促郑家屯材料厂改进工作
    锦州铁路管理局材料供应处来信：一月二十七日“读者来信摘要”栏发表“郑家屯铁路材料厂为什么把好材料当废料处理”一信后，我们即派主任监察员张惠民至该厂进行检查，结果证明读者的批评是完全正确的。该厂在处理原存旧道钉的时候，没有认真检查，竟把很大一部分好道钉当作废铁处理；而当工务段提出要求互换利用时，仍不及时改正错误，反而以搪塞的态度应付。该厂在处理旧桥梁枕木时，没有根据这批枕木的可用程度向上级请示，却擅自当作烧柴处理。以上事实说明该厂的领导干部对国家物资缺乏负责的态度；我们对该厂的工作检查不够，也应负相当的责任。在这次检查中，我们又发现该厂在供应上、材料收发制度上也有混乱现象。因此，我们决定除对该厂领导干部进行批评教育外，并增派厂长一名，以增强领导力量。此外，我们还将该厂工作中的问题通报所属各厂，以引起普遍注意，并要在今后对各厂工作经常进行监督和检查，来及时发现问题，纠正错误。
