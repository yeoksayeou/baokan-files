    How the Fushun City Shengli District People's Congress Serves Industrial and Mining Production
    Shengli District in Fushun City is an industrial and mining area. Of the district's population of over 90,000, workers and their families from state-owned industrial and mining enterprises account for more than 95 percent. Therefore, how the district's political power construction work actively serves industrial and mining production has become a fundamental issue for the district.
    Shengli District held its first People's Congress on November 20th and 21st of last year. Because the congress clearly established the idea that political power construction work should serve industrial and mining production, and earnestly discussed the issues of assisting state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in further mobilizing workers to carry out production competitions, and educating and organizing workers' families to strengthen their studies, do their housework well, and ensure workers' attendance, it greatly promoted production. The congress also gained preliminary experience in serving industrial and mining production.
    In the preparatory work for the first People's Congress of Shengli District, the correct decision was made to focus on the central topic of continuing to deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centering on the production of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. This gave the People's Congress a clear goal of serving industrial and mining production. Before the People's Congress was convened, leading cadres of the district, through the practical education of the general election, especially after the Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a report in the city on "Government work must serve industrial and mining production," began to reverse the past thinking of not concerning themselves with industrial and mining production, and seriously considered how political power work could serve production. However, due to a lack of experience, they did not know the specific methods, so they also felt that political power work was "not easy to serve industrial and mining production." Later, after in-depth study of the general line, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the task of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the city. Then, the district's leading cadres began to take the initiative to go deep into various state-owned factories and mines to solicit opinions, learning about some of the main problems existing in the increase in production and practicing economy in various factories and mines, such as the high number of accidents and low attendance rate at the Shengli Mine, and the non-standard variety plan and product quality of the electric porcelain factory. At the same time, they also seriously investigated and studied some of the problems existing in street work. Based on these situations, the district finally determined that the central topics of the first People's Congress were: to organize the people of the district to continue to deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy, to assist the factories and mines in further educating workers to conscientiously implement operating plans, strengthen the responsibility system, and ensure the comprehensive completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the state production plan; at the same time, further organize and educate workers' families to strengthen their studies, do their housework well, carry out mutual assistance, enhance unity, and ensure the improvement of workers' attendance rate; and overcome waste and increase accumulation for the country and the family from the aspects of cherishing public property, saving water and electricity, gas, and saving living expenses.
    The district conscientiously organized people's representatives to widely collect mass opinions, mobilizing the masses to "raise anything they have," and appropriately guiding the masses to express their opinions on central topics and government work. The congress received a total of 3,005 proposals, many of which were suggestions related to carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, which were of great help to the government and factories and mines in improving production work. For example, one proposal suggested that there were not enough municipal transportation vehicles for workers to go to and from work, and that they were crowded on buses, which affected workers' attendance and rest. The congress submitted this proposal to the Fushun Mining Bureau Transportation Office for study and resolution. The office immediately converted some small trucks into passenger cars, and ordered more than 20 passenger cars from Qingdao and Dalian. At the same time, it also reflected this problem to the city's transportation management department for research and improvement of traffic conditions.
    At the People's Congress, they first focused on educating the representatives on socialist industrialization based on the general task of the country's transition period. Because the realization of socialist industrialization requires the hard work of all the people, and requires the factories and mines to increase production and practice economy, this is closely linked to the central topic of continuing to deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In group discussions, the representatives put forward many concrete ways to continue to promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy. For example, it was proposed that the steel casting workshop of the Heavy Machinery Plant should complete the task of quota castings on schedule, and further mobilize workers to solve the problems of shrinkage and porosity of internal gears and herringbone gears. Zhang Yuanzeng, a labor model and people's representative of the district, proposed that the Kolesov cutting method should be implemented as a priority to ensure the early completion of the production plan. These methods were submitted to the factories and mines by the congress for research and adoption.
    The congress paid great attention to the work of workers' families. Past facts have proved that doing a good job in organizing and educating workers' families has a significant effect on ensuring the improvement of workers' attendance rate and the improvement of workers' production enthusiasm. Gan Da Niang, a worker's family member and people's representative of the district, introduced her experience in organizing workers' family mutual aid at the congress. Gan Da Niang's mutual aid group mainly organized workers' families according to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, carried out mass mutual aid activities, effectively solved the difficulties that occurred in families due to childbirth and illness, solved the difficulties of workers' families in political and cultural studies, better cared for and educated children, strengthened unity between family members and workers, promoted the collectivist spirit of the working class, and thus greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm and ensured the improvement of workers' attendance rate. These experiences are of great significance for completing and over-fulfilling the state production plan. Gan Da Niang's mutual aid group set a good example of loving the factory and caring about production. The representatives unanimously agreed to promote this experience throughout the district.
    The congress comprehensively examined the work of the District People's Government, especially focusing on the ideas of serving industrial and mining production and the "five-too-many" phenomena that still existed in street work. The people's representatives of the district who worked in various factories and mines criticized the District People's Government for treating the workers' living problems and some family disputes as minor issues and not seriously solving them in the past; criticized the District People's Government for unilaterally taking care of poor citizens, allowing them to pick coal in the mines, which affected their lives and safety, and affected the normal turnover of mine cars, hindering production. The street representatives concentrated on criticizing the "too many leaders and chaotic affairs" in street work, which affected the production and life of the masses. While making criticisms, the people's representatives also put forward many positive suggestions.
    In order to adapt to the tasks of political power work in the industrial and mining area, among the 114 people's representatives in Shengli District, 44 were representatives of factory and mine workers (most of whom were labor models who had close ties with the majority of workers), and others were representatives from various fields such as housewives (mainly workers' families), cadres of government agencies and organizations, scientific, technological, and cultural and educational workers, farmers, handicraftsmen, and students. The congress also paid attention to selecting an appropriate number of personnel from the workers of larger factories and mines to serve as members of the District People's Government. Among the 19 members of the District People's Government elected at this People's Congress, there were seven factory and mine workers (including workers, technicians, and factory and mine directors). In this way, the daily work of the government can be more conducive to serving industrial and mining production with the participation of industrial and mining enterprises.
    After the congress closed, the District Party Secretary and the District Head went deep into the factories and mines, and together with the people's government members and administrative leaders of the factories and mines who worked in the factories and mines, they conducted in-depth research on how to implement the resolutions of the congress in order to assist the administrative leaders of the factories and mines in solving problems such as safe production, implementing operating plans, and improving product quality. At the same time, cadres were organized to go deep into the streets to study how to specifically implement the resolutions of the congress in the streets. The District People's Government Committee finally convened a meeting to determine that the resolutions should be fully conveyed in conjunction with the propaganda of the general line, and discussed in detail in light of the different situations of factories and mines and streets, in combination with increasing production and practicing economy, in order to implement the resolutions of the congress. Fifteen cadres were organized to go deep into the factories and mines and streets to assist the district people's representatives in carrying out the work of conveying and implementing the resolutions of the congress.
    In the factories and mines, according to the principle of not affecting the production and rest of the factories and mines and workers, in coordination with the current work of the factories and mines, unified communication was carried out, and discussions were conducted in units of workshops, groups, and sections. In the group discussions, because the resolutions of the congress truly reflected the problems in the production of various factories and mines, such as safe production, implementation of operating plans, and improvement of attendance rates, and the discussion in units of workshops, groups, and sections possessed the three conditions of "familiar people, familiar technology, and familiar area," it was generally possible to combine specific situations and put forward many ways and guarantees to solve key problems in production. For example, the workers of the hot rolling section of the second workshop of the Electric Porcelain Factory formulated specific methods to avoid wasting working hours, eliminate accidents, and ensure that the attendance rate reaches 100%, and promised to improve quality. The Li Shuqing group and the 603 and 577 groups in the bushing workshop launched a competition, and the daily output increased by 34% compared with the original output. The daily output of coal at the Shengli Mine has now increased by 40% compared with before the general election, and production has generally reached equilibrium. This is of course mainly due to the efforts made by the mine leaders and all workers in improving production technology and management, but as the chairman of the mine trade union said: The work of the political power here has also played a major role in guaranteeing and supervising.
    In the streets, the focus of implementing the resolutions of the congress was to promote the experience of Gan Da Niang's mutual aid group for workers' families. After in-depth communication and implementation, mutual aid groups for workers' families were universally established and rectified throughout the district. Many streets also launched red flag competitions. All workers' families in Nanbeitai Street proposed to ensure that the workers' attendance rate reaches 100%. In the 51st resident group of Donggongyuan Street, all 49 households are workers' families. Although there were mutual aid groups in the past, they were in name only. This time, they proposed specific improvement methods and launched a "percentage system" mobile red flag competition (30 points for doing a good job in mutual aid, 30 points for household work, 20 points for administrative work, and 20 points for security work). Regular inspections were conducted, and the red flag was placed where the mutual aid group scored the most points. After Wang Sujie of the 11th resident group of Xincun Street improved her awareness, she actively encouraged and helped her husband, Sui Yushi (a worker at Shengli Mine), to study and propose a rationalization suggestion, which solved the problem of "car shortage" of coal transport cars underground and improved production. Zhang Shuqin of the 26th resident group of Lizigou Street used to often quarrel with her husband and was not united with her neighbors. This time, she also proposed a guarantee of "harmonious family and united neighbors."
    In order to implement the resolutions of the congress, the District People's Government also inspected and arranged its work in accordance with the resolutions of the congress. In addition to the municipal administration, public utilities, and the public security, judicial, and procuratorial work of factories and mines being uniformly controlled and arranged by the Municipal People's Government, the District People's Government has also carried out the following five aspects of regular work to serve industrial and mining production. First, the Civil Affairs Section has strengthened the organizational leadership of the mutual aid work of workers' families so that the work of workers' families can better serve industrial and mining production. During the Spring Festival, it led the mutual aid group to do a good job in ensuring the safe production of workers, having a good Spring Festival, and ensuring the attendance of workers after the festival. Many mutual aid groups also made a large number of dumplings for the workers' canteens and washed the bedding for single workers. From December 29th alone, more than 100 workers' family members went to the Shengli Mine to make dumplings and pancakes for the workers' canteens. The workers were greatly moved and educated by this, and they proposed to do a good job in the factory and mine security work during the Spring Festival and to guarantee no absenteeism. Second, the Construction Section, in cooperation with the cooperative and other relevant parties, has strengthened the supply of daily necessities for workers, and improved the living conditions of some workers. Last winter, the district once felt that the supply of soybean oil was insufficient, and workers' families and a few workers went to the cooperative to queue up to buy it. In addition to promptly reporting to the Municipal Federation of Cooperatives, the District People's Government also organized and educated workers' families to organize and go to buy in batches within the time specified by the cooperative to ensure normal supply. Third, the non-productive management work of factories and mines has been reduced from the aspects of cultural, educational, and health. The Cultural and Educational Section vigorously organized tutoring for workers' children, solved the problem of elementary school students entering higher schools, and helped factories and mines run workers' night schools well. This spring, the District People's Government also selected health models in the district to promote the health work of factories, mines, and streets throughout the district. Fourth, the District People's Government has strengthened the unified leadership of the public security police station, mediation committee, and street committee, ensuring the stability of social order and the normal progress of production; unified the pace of street work, so that the "five-too-many" phenomena in street work have been further overcome. Fifth, the District People's Government seized the opportunity of the workers' family mutual aid group holding a joint meeting of workers and family members, as well as other opportunities, to carry out ideological education for workers. During the Spring Festival, a rural tour group for workers was organized under the unified leadership of the Municipal People's Government to strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance. After the visit, the workers expressed that they would do a good job in production and better help the peasant brothers take the socialist road; the peasants also expressed that they would further organize and ensure the supply of vegetables to the workers. After the implementation of the resolutions of the congress, all departments of the District People's Government have explored some preliminary experiences in serving industrial and mining production. Cadres generally said: With a clear direction, work is much easier.
    Although the First People's Congress of Shengli District in Fushun City has achieved these significant results, there are still some shortcomings and problems. For example, some factories have not seriously implemented the resolutions because the leading cadres did not fully realize the consistency between implementing the resolutions and promoting production, fearing that implementing the resolutions would affect production. At the same time, the problems of how the people's representatives of factories and mines can regularly contact voters in the factories and mines need to be further studied and resolved in the future.

    抚顺市胜利区人民代表大会是如何为工矿生产服务的
    抚顺市胜利区是一个工矿区。全区九万余人口中，国营工矿企业的职工及其家属占百分之九十五以上。因此，区的政权建设工作如何积极地为工矿的生产服务，就成为该区的一个根本问题。
    胜利区在去年十一月二十、二十一日召开了第
  一次人民代表大会。由于大会明确树立了政权建设工作为工矿生产服务的思想，认真地讨论了协助国营工矿企业进一步发动职工开展生产竞赛和教育组织职工家属加强学习、做好家务、保证职工出勤等问题，因而大大地推动了生产。大会并取得了为工矿生产服务的初步经验。
    胜利区第一次人民代表大会在准备工作中，正确地确定了围绕着国营工矿企业生产继续深入开展增产节约运动这一中心议题，使人民代表大会有了明确的为工矿生产服务的目标。在人民代表大会召开前，该区领导干部经过普选的实际教育，特别是中共抚顺市委书记在全市作了“政府工作要为工矿生产服务”的报告后，开始扭转了过去不问工矿生产的思想，认真考虑政权工作如何为生产服务的问题。但由于缺乏经验，不知道具体做法，所以又感到政权工作“不好为工矿生产服务”。后来经过对总路线的深入学习，中共抚顺市委提出在全市开展增产节约工作的任务后，该区领导干部就开始主动地深入到各国营厂矿征求意见，了解到各厂矿在增产节约中存在的一些主要问题，如胜利矿的事故多、出勤率不高，电瓷厂的品种计划与产品质量不合标准等，同时也认真调查研究了街道工作中存在的一些问题。根据这些情况，该区最后确定第一次人民代表大会的中心议题是：组织全区人民继续深入开展增产节约运动，协助各厂矿进一步教育职工认真贯彻作业计划，加强责任制度，保证全面完成和争取超额完成国家生产计划；同时进一步组织和教育职工家属加强学习、做好家务，开展互助、增强团结、保证提高职工出勤率；并从爱护公共财产、节省水电、煤气，节省生活开支等方面来为国家和家庭克服浪费，增加积累。
    该区曾认真组织人民代表广泛地搜集群众意见，发动群众“有什么提什么”，同时适当地引导群众对中心议题和政府工作等方面发表意见。大会共收到提案三千零五件，其中有许多是与开展增产节约运动有关的建议，对帮助政府和厂矿改进生产工作有很大作用。如有一项提案提出职工上下班时市内交通工具不够，乘车拥挤，影响工人出勤和休息。大会把这一提案交由抚顺矿务局运输事务所研究解决。该所即将一部分小型货车改装成客车，并向青岛、大连订购了二十多辆客车。同时并将这一问题反映给市的交通管理部门去研究改进交通状况。
    在人民代表大会上，他们首先根据国家过渡时期的总任务，着重对代表进行了社会主义工业化的教育。因为实现社会主义工业化需要全体人民努力工作、需要工矿努力增加生产、厉行节约，这样就和继续深入开展增产节约运动的中心议题紧密联结起来。代表在分组讨论中，提出了许多继续推进增产节约运动的具体办法。如提出重型机器厂铸钢车间要按期完成定额铸件的任务，进一步发动职工解决内齿轮和人字齿轮的缩孔、气孔问题。该区人民代表劳动模范张远增提出要重点实行科列索夫切削法，保证提前完成生产计划。这些办法经大会交厂矿研究采用。
    大会对于职工家属的工作给予很大的注意。过去的事实证明，做好职工家属的组织教育工作，对于保证提高职工出勤率、提高职工生产积极性，有显著的作用。该区人民代表职工家属甘大娘在大会上介绍了组织职工家属互助的经验。甘大娘互助组的经验，主要是把职工家属按照自愿互利的原则组织起来，展开群众性的互助活动，有效地解决家庭中因生育、疾病而发生的困难，解决职工家属政治文化学习的困难，更好地照顾和教育儿童，加强家属之间、工人之间的团结，发扬工人阶级集体主义的精神，并因此而大大鼓舞职工的生产热情，保证提高职工出勤率。这些经验，对于完成和超额完成国家生产计划有很大的作用。甘大娘互助组树立了热爱工厂、关心生产的良好榜样。代表们一致赞成在全区范围内推广这一经验。
    大会全面地检查了区人民政府的工作，特别着重检查了为工矿生产服务的思想以及街道工作中仍然存在着的一些“五多”现象。在各厂矿工作的该区人民代表们批评区人民政府过去把职工生活问题和一些家庭纠纷看作小问题，不认真解决；批评区人民政府片面照顾贫苦市民，允许他们到矿山拣煤，影响他们生命的安全，而且影响矿山车皮正常周转，妨碍生产。街道代表集中地批评了街道工作中的“头多事乱”，影响群众生产和生活的现象。在进行批评的同时，人民代表们也提出了许多积极的建议。
    胜利区人民代表大会的组成，为了适应工矿区政权工作的任务，在全区一百一十四名人民代表中，厂矿职工方面的代表有四十四人（多数是与广大职工有密切联系的劳动模范），其他是家庭妇女（主要是职工家属）、机关团体干部、科学技术和文教工作者、农民、手工业者、学生等方面的代表。大会又注意从较大的厂矿的职工中选出适当数量的人员担任区人民政府委员。在这次人民代表大会选出的十九名区人民政府委员中，厂矿职工
  （包括工人、技术人员、厂矿长）有七名。这样就可以使政府的日常工作在工矿企业部门的参加下，更利于为工矿生产服务。
    大会闭会后，区委书记和区长都深入厂矿，与在厂矿中工作的人民政府委员及厂矿行政领导干部深入研究了如何贯彻大会决议，以便协助厂矿行政解决安全生产，贯彻作业计划，提高产品质量等问题。同时也组织干部深入街道，研究了街道中如何具体贯彻大会决议的问题。区人民政府委员会最后开会确定，要结合宣传总路线，全面传达决议，根据厂矿与街道不同的情况，具体结合增产节约进行讨论，以贯彻大会决议。并组织了十五名干部深入厂矿和街道，协助区人民代表展开传达和贯彻大会决议的工作。
    在厂矿中，根据不影响厂矿生产和职工休息的原则，配合厂矿当前工作，又作了统一传达，并以车间、小组、科室为单位进行讨论。在分组讨论中，由于大会决议真正反映了各厂矿生产中的问题，如安全生产、贯彻作业计划、提高出勤率等问题，而按车间、小组、科室等单位讨论又具备了“人熟、技术熟、地区熟”三个条件，因而一般都能结合具体情况，提出许多解决生产上关键问题的办法及保证条件。如电瓷厂第二车间热轧工段职工订出了不浪费工时、消灭事故、保证达到出勤率百分之百的具体办法，并保证提高质量。套管车间李淑清小组和六○三、五七七等小组展开了竞赛，一天的生产量就比原生产量提高了百分之三十四。胜利矿煤的日产量现在已较普选前提高了百分之四十，生产一般也达到均衡。这固然主要靠该矿领导及全体职工在改进生产技术和管理上所作的努力，但正如该矿工会主席说的：政权工作在这里也起了重大的保证和监督作用。
    在街道中，贯彻大会决议的重点是推广甘大娘职工家属互助组的经验。经过深入传达贯彻，全区普遍建立和整顿了职工家属互助组。许多街道并开展了红旗竞赛。南北台街全体职工家属提出保证职工出勤率达到百分之百。东公园街五十一居民组四十九户，全是职工家属，过去虽有互助组，但流于形式。这次她们提出了具体改进的办法，展开了“百分制”的流动红旗竞赛（作好互助工作得三十分、家务工作三十分、行政工作二十分、治安工作二十分），定期检查，那个互助小组得分最多，红旗就插到那里。新村街十一居民组王素洁提高觉悟后，积极鼓励和帮助丈夫隋雨时（胜利矿工人）研究提出一项合理化建议，解决了井下运煤车的“车荒”问题，提高了生产。栗子沟街二十六居民组张淑琴过去常和丈夫吵架，和邻居不团结，这次也提出了“和睦家庭、团结邻居”的保证。
    胜利区人民政府为实现大会决议，也根据大会决议检查和布置了工作。除市政、公用事业以及厂矿方面的公安、司法、检察等工作由市人民政府统一掌握布置外，区人民政府又从如下五个方面进行了为工矿生产服务的经常工作。一、民政股加强了职工家属互助工作的组织领导，使职工家属工作能够更好地为工矿生产服务。春节期间即领导互助组作好了保证职工安全生产、过好春节和保证职工节后出勤的工作。许多互助组并给职工食堂包了大批饺子，还给单身职工拆洗了被服。仅腊月二十九日到胜利矿给职工食堂包饺子、摊煎饼的职工家属就有一百多人。职工们因此受到很大的感动和教育，纷纷提出作好春节期间厂矿保安工作和不缺勤的保证。二、建设股配合合作社及其他有关方面，加强了对职工日常生活物资的供应，改善了一些职工居住的条件。去冬该区曾一度感到豆油供应不足，职工家属和少数职工纷纷前往合作社排队购买，区人民政府除及时向市联社反映外，并组织和教育职工家属，在合作社指定的时间内，组织起来，分批前往购买，保证了正常供应。三、从文教卫生方面减轻了厂矿非生产的管理工作。文教股大力组织职工子女补习，解决了小学生升学的问题，并帮助厂矿办好职工夜校。今春区人民政府还评选了全区的卫生模范，推动了全区厂矿和街道的卫生工作。四、区人民政府加强了公安派出所、调解委员会和街道委员会的统一领导，保证了社会秩序的安定和生产的正常进行；统一了街道工作的步调，使街道工作中的“五多”现象得到进一步的克服。五、区人民政府利用职工家属互助组召开职工与家属联席会的时候，以及其他机会，抓紧进行了对职工的思想教育工作。春节期间，在市人民政府统一领导下组织了工人农村参观团，加强了工农联盟的教育。参观之后，工人表示要搞好生产，更好地帮助农民兄弟走社会主义的道路；农民也表示要进一步组织起来，并保证对工人的菜蔬供应。经过大会决议的贯彻，区人民政府各部门都摸索到一些为工矿生产服务的初步经验。干部普遍说：有了明确的方向，工作好做多了。
    抚顺市胜利区第一次人民代表大会虽然取得了这些重大成绩，但也还存在一些缺点和问题。如一部分工厂由于领导干部没有充分认识到贯彻决议与推动生产的一致性，怕贯彻决议会影响生产，因而没有认真贯彻决议。同时厂矿的人民代表在厂矿中如何经常联系选民等问题，也有待今后进一步研究解决。　　（政务院政治法律委员会宣传组）
