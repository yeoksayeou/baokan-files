    Worker Li Tingxiu of the Private Deji Iron Factory Reports Serious Illegal Activities by Capitalists
    A letter from the People's Complaint Reception Office of the Central People's Supervisory Committee: In January of this year, Li Tingxiu, a worker at the private Deji Iron Factory in Beijing, reported to the People's Complaint Reception Office of the Central People's Supervisory Committee that the capitalists of the private Deji Iron Factory were seriously cutting corners and using inferior materials when processing and manufacturing sports equipment for the Beijing Company of the China General Merchandise Company. After we instructed the China General Merchandise Company to investigate, it was proven that the situation reported by Li Tingxiu was completely true. In 1953, the total value of sports equipment processed by the private Deji Iron Factory for the Beijing Department Store Company was over 2.2 billion yuan, and the amount of material cut and corners amounted to over 115 million yuan. The investigation also revealed that the factory also cut corners in making sports equipment for other units, such as the "sky bridge" processed for a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, because inferior materials were used instead of good materials, the quality of the finished product was very poor. When the Beijing Department Store Company began its investigation, Li Deji, the manager of the private Deji Iron Factory, initially refused to confess; later, due to conclusive evidence, Li Deji had no choice but to admit the above facts. The Beijing Department Store Company has filed a lawsuit with the Xuanwu District People's Court of Beijing, demanding that this lawless merchant be punished according to law.
    Comrade Li Tingxiu's spirit of cherishing state property is worthy of praise. The Youth Culture Service Department of the Beijing Company of the China General Merchandise Company was not vigilant enough about the "five poisons" of unscrupulous capitalists and was careless in its acceptance work. It should improve in the future.

    私营德记铁工厂工人李廷锈检举资方严重的违法行为
    中央人民监察委员会人民检举接待室来信：今年一月，北京市私营德记铁工厂工人李廷锈，向中央人民监察委员会人民检举接待室检举了私营德记铁工厂资方，在给中国百货公司北京市公司加工制做体育器械时的严重偷工减料行为。经我们责成中国百货公司检查，证明李廷锈所检举的情况完全属实。私营德记铁工厂在一九五三年给北京市百货公司加工的体育器械总值二十二亿余元，偷工减料达一亿一千五百余万元。在检查中还发现该厂承做其他单位的体育器械时也有不少偷工减料的情形，如给中国人民志愿军某部加工的“天桥”，因为以次料顶替好料，成品质量很坏。北京市百货公司在开始进行检查时，私营德记铁工厂经理李德吉还拒不坦白；后来由于证据确凿，李德吉才不得不承认了上述事实。北京市百货公司已向北京市宣武区人民法院提出控诉，要求依法惩处这个不法奸商。
    李廷锈同志这种爱护国家财产的精神是值得表扬的。中国百货公司北京市公司青年文化服务部对不法资本家的“五毒”行为警惕不够，在验收工作中草率马虎，今后应该改进。
