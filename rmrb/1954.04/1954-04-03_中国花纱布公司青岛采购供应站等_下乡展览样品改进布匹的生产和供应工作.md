The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Qingdao Purchasing and Supply Station and the Qingdao Supply and Sales Branch of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in order to understand the needs and preferences of the masses for colored cloth, organized two exhibitions of printed and dyed textile products in the countryside, starting in December of last year. Relevant business personnel, factory technicians, designers, etc. carried nearly a thousand kinds of colored cloth samples and summer colored cloth design patterns to rural areas in Wendeng, Yidu, Dezhou, Tai'an and other places in Shandong Province for exhibitions lasting more than two months. At the same time, forums were held in various places inviting cadres from grassroots sales units such as supply and marketing cooperatives, department stores, and cotton yarn and cloth companies to exchange opinions.

During the exhibition, farmers and relevant units provided many valuable opinions, which greatly educated the designers and supply staff. After the exhibition, the relevant parties revised the summer colored cloth production plan based on the demands of the masses and carried out variety communication work in various places in order to regularly listen to the opinions of the masses and improve cloth production and supply. The masses also welcomed the method of exhibiting samples. Many farmers said, "It is really our own people's factory. They even ask us for opinions on what kind of colored cloth to produce. We must also step up production of industrial raw materials and other materials to support industrial production!"

    中国花纱布公司青岛采购供应站等
    下乡展览样品改进布匹的生产和供应工作
    中国花纱布公司青岛采购供应站和中央人民政府纺织工业部青岛供销分局，为了了解群众对花色布的需要和爱好，从去年十二月份开始，先后组织了两次印染、纺织产品下乡展览。有关经营业务人员、工厂技师、设计人员等携带了近千种花色布样品和夏季花布设计图案等，到山东省文登、益都、德州、泰安等地农村展览了两个多月。同时，还在各地邀请供销合作社、百货公司、花纱布公司等基层销货单位的干部举行了座谈会，交换了意见。
    展览期间，农民和各有关单位提供了许多宝贵的意见，使设计人员，供应工作人员等受到很大教育。展览后，有关方面根据群众要求，修改了夏季花色布的生产计划，并开展了各地品种通讯工作，以便经常听取群众意见，改进布匹生产和供应工作。群众对展览样品的办法也很欢迎，许多农民说：“真是我们人民自己的工厂，连要生产什么样的花布都找我们提意见。我们也一定要加劲生产工业原料等，支援工业生产！”
