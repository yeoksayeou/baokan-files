    The Spirit of Criticism and Self-Criticism of "Pravda" as I Understand It
    Zhang Chunqiao
    An Indestructible Principle of
        Newspaper Work
    The decades of historical experience of Soviet newspapers, led by "Pravda," tell us that carrying out criticism and self-criticism is an indestructible principle of Soviet newspapers. Newspapers use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to help the Party educate the people into strong and loyal fighters.
    The successive congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially the congresses after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, have all made clear and firm instructions on the issue of carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. The famous resolution on the press made by the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1919, on the one hand, emphasized that the Party and Soviet press are the most powerful tools of propaganda, agitation, and organization, and an irreplaceable means of influencing the broadest masses; on the other hand, it called on the Party press to launch criticism and self-criticism: "One of the most important tasks of the Party and Soviet newspapers is to expose various criminal acts of officials and organs, and to point out the mistakes and shortcomings of the Party and Soviet organizations. All of this must be done in a realistic and comradely manner. The personnel and organs whose behavior is mentioned in the newspaper must make a realistic correction or indicate the correction of the mistake in the same newspaper within the shortest possible period. If there is no such correction or acknowledgment, the revolutionary court shall accuse the personnel and organs indicated." These regulations are still being followed today.
    With the victorious development of socialist construction and the successful completion of several Five-Year Plans, criticism and self-criticism have been more significantly carried out in newspapers. At the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a letter to all Party members and all workers on June 3, 1928, putting forward the famous slogan of criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top, regardless of the object or giving face, which became the basic guideline for the Party and Soviet press to carry out criticism and self-criticism.
    The 19th Congress of the Party once again pointed out the immeasurable significance of criticism and self-criticism in promoting the cause of the Party.
    Why did the Party make so many resolutions and constantly raise this issue repeatedly?
    Comrades of the "Pravda" editorial department told us that carrying out criticism and self-criticism is not without obstacles. Being criticized will never evoke the same feeling as being praised, nor will it bring the same pleasure as a child being caressed on the head by his mother. There is no way to avoid this. It has not been easy to get to the point where, when seeing the newspaper, the personnel and organs being criticized consciously write self-criticisms to the newspaper editorial department. More than 20 years ago, some responsible cadres were disciplined for making mistakes in their attitude towards criticism. Even today, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Party press still need to continue to struggle to ensure that Party members and working people can criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the Party and the government without any worries, and to ensure that their criticism has practical effects. This is also an important part of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's struggle to consolidate the Party's ties with the people, eliminate the remnants of capitalist ideology, and build communism.
    Comrades of the "Pravda" editorial department have introduced us to many examples illustrating how the Party has launched struggles to pave the way for criticism and self-criticism.
    "Pravda" once published a satirical sketch entitled: "The Incident of Anna Vasilyevna." It tells the story of an incident that happened in Moscow: Anna Vasilyevna was an active female Party member who criticized the district committee at a Party meeting. The district committee was very unhappy and began to attack her, eventually dismissing her from her job. She went to "Pravda" to appeal and asked "Pravda" to help her. The "Pravda" editorial department sent Comrade Kolosov to investigate. He proved that her reflection was true, and Comrade Kolosov wrote this sketch and published it. This issue was valued by the Party Central Committee and was brought up for discussion at a meeting of the Central Committee. The meeting decided to set up a special committee to investigate. The members of the committee included the Secretary of the Party Central Committee, the heads of the Supreme Procuratorate of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Court, and Kolosov, the author of the sketch. They investigated the district committee where the incident occurred and also talked to many Party members, finding that criticism and self-criticism were not well developed in this district. The committee made a report at the Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided to restore Anna Vasilyevna's job, dismiss the secretary of the district committee, and instruct the Moscow Municipal Committee to pay attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    "Pravda" has fought many battles to support the criticism of local newspapers. Once, a state newspaper criticized the staff of the state trade department because they held a food exhibition, and the staff ate all the exhibits at the end. The state newspaper mentioned in its criticism that they sang a song called "The Reed Sounds" while drinking. Those who were criticized were not convinced and retorted that although they ate all the things, they did not sing this song, so the "criticism did not match the facts." "Pravda" wrote a sketch entitled "The Reed Sounds," satirizing their attitude towards criticism.
    Some cadres emphasized the difficulties in their work, saying that there were difficulties here and there, and reporters came and wrote about their many shortcomings, making them very passive and troubled. The Party told them that criticism in the newspaper was precisely to help them overcome difficulties, which is the Party's basic working method. Without it, they could not overcome difficulties and move forward.
      Criticism and Self-Criticism Involve All Areas
        of Life and Become a Way of Life
    During our visit to the Soviet Union, we deeply felt that criticism and self-criticism have become a way of life here. People need it, just like they need air and water. In newspapers, one can often see criticism of all aspects of work, and mainly criticism of important departments and important cadres that have a decisive impact on the development of things. For example, "Pravda" criticized the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union on March 25, 1953, the Minister of the Timber and Paper Industry on November 12, the Gorky State Committee (including several Party committee secretaries) in nearly half a page on November 16, the Minister of the Coal Industry of the Soviet Union on December 14, the Minister and Deputy Minister of the Agriculture of the Soviet Union on the 16th, the Ministry of the Building Materials Industry of the Soviet Union on the 18th, and the leaders of the Molotov State Committee on January 14, 1954. "Pravda" published 125 sketches last year. Every editorial, when discussing domestic issues, contains criticism and praise.
      "Pravda's" criticism involves all areas of life. Because the Party leads all work, the Party organ newspaper should reflect the Party's deep concern for all aspects of life.
    Recently, the Party has paid special attention to agricultural issues, and "Pravda's" criticism has also focused on agriculture. The criticism of the Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union and several state committees is all about agricultural issues.
    The Party has put forward the task of developing light industry, and "Pravda" has criticized the leaders of the light industry departments of the Soviet Union. However, since light industry is often affected by other industrial departments, it also criticizes relevant ministries. For example, on August 13 last year, an article "It is time for the Ministry of Chemical Industry to provide textile workers with good dyes!" was published, written by three scholars and two engineers; on September 3, another paper "The Ministry of Machine Building Industry should expand the production of equipment for light industry" was published, co-authored by three doctors of technical sciences, two masters, and one engineer.
    All areas of ideological work are of constant concern to "Pravda." In recent months, the comments published on literary and artistic issues include: Striving for the diversity of creation, Modern rural life in literary and art magazines, Why our poetry is lagging behind, Stricter requirements for the techniques of poetry, What is hindering the development of film art, Where is the difficulty in developing mass songs, The Soviet Artists Association lacks a creative atmosphere, The performances should be more diverse, Serving the issue of performances for rural music, Pay more attention to rural audiences, Before the Second Writers Congress, etc.
    Reviews of newspapers and books occupy an important position in "Pravda," with six or seven newspaper reviews published every month; last year, 160 book reviews were published.
    In short, the theme of "Pravda's" criticism is diverse and is not limited to the current central work. Life itself is so rich and colorful, and the struggle between the new and the old is so vivid and sharp that newspapers should not only be concerned with this or that aspect of life. It should give clear answers to the various questions raised in life. Of course, life itself also shows which questions are major and which are minor, and newspapers should reflect the true face of life and struggle.
      Source of Themes
    The main basis for criticism is the Party's resolutions and policies. The strength of the press lies in the fact that it is the Party's organ newspaper, and it adheres to the principle of Party spirit. "Pravda's" recent criticisms are to mobilize the masses to successfully complete the resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Party and the September 1953 Central Plenary Session. The Party Central Committee regularly gives specific instructions to the editorial department, and the leaders of Party organizations in various places also regularly point out the themes and objects of criticism to "Pravda's" local reporters.
    Letters from the broad masses of working people have become the most important source for selecting the themes and objects of criticism. In 1953, the "Pravda" editorial department received 400,000 letters. The department of letters from workers registered the various issues raised in the letters on theme cards, making it convenient for the editorial department to use the letters. Many editorials and papers begin by quoting letters from workers. More than 90 of the 125 sketches published last year were written based on letters from workers. Some letters, after being investigated and verified, were published in their original form. For example, the letter "Why are coastal mines lagging behind?" published on December 14, 1953, which criticized the Minister of the Coal Industry of the Soviet Union, was jointly written by workers, the Party committee secretary, and a socialist labor hero of the mine. The letter criticizing the Ministry of the Building Materials Industry of the Soviet Union on December 18 was a letter from an advanced worker, which was published after the reporter's investigation and supplementation.
    "Pravda's" local reporters also wrote many critical manuscripts from various places. For example, "Promises and Reality" published on December 11 last year was written by a "Pravda" reporter from Dnepropetrovsk, criticizing the director of the Dzerzhinsky Metallurgical Plant for not doing what he said and failing to complete the plan, and also criticizing the Ministry of the Metallurgical Industry of the Soviet Union. "Leningrad's Handicraft Cooperatives Can and Should Work Better," published on December 7, was also written by a reporter.
      Flexible and Lively Forms
    "Pravda's" criticism is not only rich and diverse in content, but also flexible and lively in form.
    Essays, newsletters, readers' letters, and cartoons are forms that we often use for criticism, so I won't talk much about them here.
    Criticism in editorials is a form that we use less often. "Pravda" has editorials every day, and editorials on domestic issues rarely fail to mention shortcomings in work, rarely fail to make sharp criticisms, and often mention names. It is easy to understand that since criticism and self-criticism are so important, and editorials are the most important articles in each issue of the newspaper, the editorial department will not fail to use this form when carrying out criticism.
    The most popular form among readers is satirical sketches. These are written in literary language, with plots and images. Its characteristic is that it must have laughter; laughter includes smiles, ridicule, and angry laughter. Just like painters choose different colors, writers choose different laughter according to the different objects of satire. "Pravda" and other Soviet newspapers have always valued this sharp weapon of struggle. Because, in the Soviet Union, although the hostile class has been eliminated, the Soviet Union is still surrounded by capitalism, and there are still remnants of bourgeois ideology influencing it, satire has become the most powerful weapon to combat bourgeois ideology. The attention attracted by this kind of satirical sketch can be understood by just one example: In the case of crowded manuscripts, the departments of the editorial department voluntarily give up their places to it, saying: "Without satirical sketches, how can we run a newspaper?"
    It should be explained that our newspapers often use the form of news to carry out criticism, but "Pravda" does not use it. Because news is an important form of agitation, it should be quick and concise, not suitable for investigation and analysis, and it is impossible to analyze events clearly in a short news item. Criticism always requires reasoning. Therefore, "Pravda" and other newspapers do not use this form when carrying out criticism (only in individual cases, a sentence or two about shortcomings in work are mentioned in passing in the news), thus avoiding many avoidable shortcomings.
    Critical manuscripts, except for editorials, are generally published on the second page. The first page is news.
    Independently, Responsibly, and Correctly Carrying Out
        Criticism Under the Leadership of the Party Committee
    "Pravda" is independently responsible when carrying out criticism. This means that "Pravda's" criticism is responsible to the Party Central Committee and is not subject to any restrictions.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has given its organ newspaper the power and obligation to be independently responsible. The newspaper is to defend the interests of the Party, the country, and the people. It should criticize the shortcomings and mistakes in the work of the Party and the country without any scruples and attract the masses to participate in the construction of communism. This criticism should be regardless of the object or giving face. Whether it is a large cadre or a small cadre, if there are shortcomings and mistakes, they can be criticized without asking for the other party's consent. The main reason why "Pravda's" editorials are all written by itself is that only the editorial department can write objective and fair editorials. The reporter's activities in the local area are only directly led by the editorial department, which is also to ensure that he is not subject to any restrictions when carrying out criticism. The newspaper's correspondents are also organized around the editorial department on a voluntary basis and do not belong to any other organization. "Pravda" does not need to go through any party's consent and approval before publishing critical manuscripts. All of these are to ensure the initiative, enthusiasm, and sharpness of the editorial department in carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    Of course, the editorial department of the Party's organ newspaper has no right to oppose the Party committee, and it cannot criticize the Party committee to which it belongs in the newspaper. Only when the Party committee itself deems it necessary can it publish manuscripts criticizing the Party committee. If the newspaper editorial department thinks it is necessary, it can write manuscripts criticizing the Party committee to the organ newspaper of the superior Party committee. The local Party committee organ newspaper must reprint the criticism of the local Party committee by the organ newspaper of the superior Party committee.
    At the same time, it should be explained that this is by no means to say that the newspaper editorial department can take a frivolous attitude towards criticism. On the contrary, the editorial department understands that the responsibility it shoulders is very heavy and must never abuse its power. Before publishing manuscripts, it always repeatedly investigates the facts, understands various different opinions from various aspects, and then independently and responsibly determines whether to publish or how to publish.
      The spirit of independent and responsible work shown by the "Pravda" editorial department in handling critical manuscripts deeply moved us. According to what we have heard and seen, this spirit is specifically manifested in the following aspects:
    First, clearly understand the purpose of criticism, which is to help the Party and the people correct shortcomings and mistakes, and to help the Party and the people promote all work forward. It is wrong to think that criticism and self-criticism in newspapers will be used by the enemy and will make some people uncomfortable, so they dare not carry out criticism and self-criticism. The nutrition that the people get from our criticism and self-criticism is more.
    In order to achieve this goal, we must distinguish between enemies and comrades. For enemies, criticism is to eliminate them, not to help them correct their mistakes; for comrades, criticism is to help them correct their mistakes, not to eliminate them. The newspaper editorial department must consider issues from the perspective of the interests of the Party and the people. The Party press should be the embodiment of the Party's will. It cannot be afraid to criticize someone just because he is an authority, nor can it be embarrassed to criticize someone because he is a friend. Criticism should be regardless of the object or giving face. However, the editorial department must work creatively and cannot use one ruler to measure everything. It must be realistic, cautious, and fair. The tone of criticism is very important. The Party teaches us: do not replace comments with clubs. Especially when criticizing people, we should pay attention to not hurting comrades' self-esteem and not allowing insults, but we should pay attention to propriety. We must understand that it is easy to criticize others' shortcomings, but it is very difficult to help a comrade overcome shortcomings.
    This is the ideological and principled nature of criticism, that is, the Party spirit of criticism. On the one hand, the Party educates cadres to correctly treat criticism in newspapers, and to follow Comrade Stalin's instructions that even if it is only 5% correct, they should humbly accept it and not block the way of speech. On the other hand, the Party requires the editorial department to adhere to the correctness of criticism.
    Second, in order to ensure the correctness of criticism, the editorial department adopts a very cautious attitude and uses very thorough and meticulous methods to conduct serious investigations on every critical manuscript published in the newspaper in advance. Only manuscripts written by reporters are no longer investigated, because reporters have been strictly selected, educated by the Party, and understand the requirements of the editorial department for them. He knows that an untrue criticism will bring incalculable losses to the newspaper.
      The investigation of manuscripts includes two items, namely the author and the facts.
    First, investigate who the author is, and whether it is worth publishing his name in the newspaper. A person's name should be regarded as a major event when it is published in "Pravda." He must be a person who has not done anything bad politically and morally to meet the readers in "Pravda" as an author. At the same time, this investigation can also prevent bad people from impersonating other people's names.
    Second, investigate whether the facts are true. The honor of the Soviet people is that the investigation has proved that the vast majority of the facts revealed in the letters are true. However, we cannot fail to investigate because of this. To trust and to investigate are iron principles. Facts have also proved this: investigation is necessary, which is not only a prerequisite for ensuring the authenticity of criticism, but also often makes a simple letter a profound paper because of the investigation. Readers originally pointed out only a superficial phenomenon, and the paper reveals the problem from the essence. Comrades of the "Pravda" editorial department told us that decades of experience have proved that investigation has only advantages and no disadvantages; not investigating has only disadvantages and no advantages.
    The method of investigation is to investigate on the spot through local reporters, and to entrust the local newspaper editorial department to investigate where there are no local reporters. In the investigation, we must talk to people from all walks of life, both those who agree and those who disagree, both the parties concerned and the relevant people. When necessary, we also look for the competent departments and leaders, not to ask him to approve the publication, but to make the criticism more accurate. People from all walks of life are happy to help this kind of investigation. Helping reporters with their work is an honor and an obligation. Therefore, the investigation of an event does not take a long time.
    In order to finally confirm the authenticity of the manuscript, the editorial department also sends a telegram to the author before deciding to publish it: "Please confirm that the author's name and facts are correct." Generally, a reply is received: "Confirm that the author's name and facts are correct." The round-trip telegram fee is paid by the editorial department.
    Third, in order to ensure the correctness of criticism, important criticisms and comments must be discussed by the editorial board. According to tradition, Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues, Party building issues, diplomatic issues, literary and artistic issues, etc. must be discussed by the editorial board. Of course, not everything is discussed, only new issues need to be discussed. When discussing, the author of the comment is invited to participate. This rule is strictly observed. For some more complicated issues that are not easy to draw conclusions, the criticized person is also invited to participate in the discussion.
    Fourth, in order to ensure the correctness of criticism, for particularly important criticisms, the editorial department should take the initiative to ask the Party committee for instructions and consult with relevant departments. The editorial department can ask the Party committee for instructions at any time, but the Party requires the editorial department to handle issues more independently and responsibly, and the editorial department does not abuse its convenient conditions. It is of course very convenient to ask the Party committee for instructions on all issues, but this is an overly simple method and a manifestation of immaturity. The editorial department should think independently, brew maturely, and truly become a powerful assistant to the Party committee.
    Consulting with various relevant departments is also to correctly judge the issue. The editorial department respects the opinions of all parties, but the final conclusion is made by the editorial department itself. Various departments have no right to order the editorial department to accept or reject manuscripts. Because the newspaper is the organ newspaper of the Party committee, the leadership of the newspaper is unified and concentrated in the Party committee and the first secretary.
    Fifth, we must fight for the effectiveness of criticism. The Party's regulations are: After the newspaper publishes a manuscript, the criticized department and leaders should hold a meeting to discuss it, and notify the newspaper editorial department of the results of the discussion and the measures taken. Due to the limited space in the newspaper, the editorial department can only publish the most important abstracts of the review. Now, there is no such thing as not reviewing or notifying the editorial department.
    In order to ensure that the criticism has practical effects, "Pravda" has taken two measures: one is to publish another comment with more severe criticism when receiving a letter with a formalistic reply to the criticism; the other is to check how the actual correction has been made after a period of time after the criticism. In this way, the criticized person cannot get rid of the supervision of public opinion. We have heard such words in several famous factories: "Pravda" criticized their factory a long time ago, and they still remember it to this day. A criticism has helped them for many years.

专栏：苏联报纸经验

    我所领会的“真理报”进行批评和自我批评的精神
    张春桥
    报刊工作的一个不可破坏的
        原则
    以“真理报”为首的苏联报刊的几十年的历史经验告诉我们：开展批评和自我批评是苏联报刊的一个不可破坏的原则。报纸以批评和自我批评的武器帮助党把人民教育成坚强的忠诚的战士。
    苏联共产党的历次代表大会，特别是伟大十月社会主义革命取得胜利以后的各次代表大会，对在报纸上开展批评和自我批评的问题都作了明确坚定的指示。一九一九年俄共（布）第八次代表大会所作的关于报刊的著名决议，一方面强调指出了党和苏维埃的报刊是宣传、鼓动、组织的最有力的工具，是不可代替的影响最广大群众的手段；另方面号召党的报刊展开批评和自我批评：“党和苏维埃报纸最重要的任务之一——揭露在职人员和机关的各种犯罪行为，指出党和苏维埃组织的错误和缺点。所有这些，必须以实事求是的和同志的态度来做。被报纸说到他的行为的人员和机关，必须在最短期间内在同一报纸上加以实事求是的更正，或指明关于错误的改正，如果没有这种更正和承认，革命法庭即控诉被指明的人员和机关。”这些规定到今天仍然是被遵守着的。
    随着社会主义建设的胜利发展，随着几个五年计划的胜利完成，批评和自我批评在报纸上更显著地开展起来了。在第一个五年计划开始时期，苏联共产党中央委员会在一九二八年六月三日发表了告全体党员、全体工人书，提出了不问对象、不顾情面、自上而下、自下而上的批评和自我批评的著名口号，成为党和苏维埃报刊开展批评和自我批评的基本方针。
    党的第十九次代表大会，又一次指出了批评和自我批评对推动党的事业前进的不可估量的巨大意义。
    为什么党要作出这么多的决议，并且要不断地反复地提出这个问题呢？
    “真理报”编辑部的同志们告诉我们说：开展批评和自我批评并不是没有遇到阻碍的。一个人受到批评时，绝不会唤起他受表扬时的那种感觉，也不会得到像小孩子被母亲抚摸着脑袋时的那种愉快，这是没有办法的事。做到今天这样，使被批评的人员和机关在看到报纸以后都自觉地给报纸编辑部写检讨，不是一件容易的事。二十多年前就有一些负责干部因为在对待批评的态度上犯错误而受到了处分。直到今天，苏联共产党和党的报刊仍然需要继续进行斗争，来保证党员和劳动人民毫无顾虑地批评党和政府的缺点和错误，来保证他们的批评得到切实的效果，这也是苏联共产党为巩固党和人民的联系，为消灭资本主义思想残余，为建设共产主义而斗争的重要组成部分。
    “真理报”编辑部同志曾向我们介绍了许多例子，说明党曾经怎样展开斗争，为批评和自我批评开辟道路。
    “真理报”上有一次发表了一篇讽刺小品，题目是：“安娜·瓦西利亚的事件”。讲的是一件发生在莫斯科的事情：安娜·瓦西利亚是一个积极的女党员，因为在党的会议上批评了区委，区委很不高兴，开始时是打击她，最后撤销了她的工作。她到“真理报”去申诉，要求“真理报”帮助她。“真理报”编辑部派记者柯洛索夫同志作了调查，证明她的反映是真实的，就由柯洛索夫同志写成这篇小品文发表了。这个问题受到党中央的重视，并且被提到中央的会议上去讨论。会议决定成立专门委员会进行检查，参加委员会的有党中央书记、苏联最高检察署和最高法院的负责人，小品文的作者柯洛索夫。他们对发生这一事件的区委会进行了调查，同时也和许多党员谈了话，发现这个区的批评和自我批评开展得不好。委员会在中央会议上作了报告。会议决定恢复安娜·瓦西利亚的工作，撤销区委书记的职务，并指示莫斯科市委要注意开展批评和自我批评工作。
    “真理报”为支持地方报纸的批评作过许多斗争。曾经有一个州报批评州贸易部的工作人员。因为他们办了一个食品展览会，在结束时工作人员把展览品都吃光了。州报在批评中曾提到他们在喝酒时唱了一支名为“芦苇响起来了”的歌子。被批评者看了不服，反驳说虽然吃光了东西，但是没有唱这个歌，所以“批评与事实不符”。“真理报”写了一篇题目叫作“芦苇响起来了”的小品文，讽刺他们对待批评的态度。
    有一些干部强调工作中的困难，说他们那里这也有困难，那也有困难，记者又来了，写了他们的许多缺点，弄得他们很被动，很麻烦。党就告诉他们：报纸上的批评正是为了帮助他们克服困难，这是党的基本工作方法，离开了它便不能克服困难，不能前进一步。
      批评和自我批评涉及生活的
        各个领域，成了生活习惯
    我们在苏联访问中，深深地感觉到：批评和自我批评在这里已经成为生活习惯。人们需要它，真像需要空气和水一样。在报纸上经常地可以看到对各方面工作的批评，而且主要是批评对事物的发展有决定性影响的重要部门和重要干部。举例来说：“真理报”一九五三年三月二十五日批评了苏联国家计划委员会，十一月十二日批评了木材和造纸工业部部长，十一月十六日用将近半版的篇幅批评了高尔基州委（包括几位党委书记），十二月十四日批评了苏联煤矿工业部部长，十六日批评了苏联农业部部长和副部长，十八日批评了苏联建筑材料工业部，一九五四年一月十四日批评了莫洛托夫州委的领导人。“真理报”去年一年发表的小品文就有一百二十五篇。每天的社论，凡是谈国内问题的，都是有批评、有表扬的。
      “真理报”的批评涉及生活的各个领域。因为党领导一切工作，党的机关报应当反映出党对生活的各个方面的深切的关怀。
    最近时期，党特别注意农业问题，“真理报”的批评也着重在农业方面，对苏联农业部部长和几个州委的批评都是关于农业问题的。
    党提出了发展轻工业的任务，“真理报”曾经批评了苏联轻工业部门的领导人。但是由于轻工业也常常受到其他工业部门的影响，所以也批评有关各部。如去年八月十三日就发表了一篇文章“是时候了，化学工业部应供给纺织员工好的染料！”是由三个学者和两个工程师写的；九月三日又发表了一篇论文“机器制造工业部应为轻工业扩大生产装备”，是三个技术科学博士、两个硕士和一个工程师合写的。
    思想工作的各个领域是“真理报”经常关心的方面。最近几个月中对文学艺术问题发表的评论有：为创作的多样性而斗争、文艺杂志上的现代农村生活、为什么我们的诗落后了、对诗的技巧要求更严格些、是什么在妨碍电影艺术的发展、发展群众歌曲的困难在那里、苏联画家协会缺乏创造的气氛、上演的节目要多样些、为农村音乐上演节目服务问题、要更关心农村的观众、在第二次作家代表大会之前，等等。
    报刊和书籍的评论在“真理报”占着重要地位，每月要发表六、七篇报刊述评；去年发表的书评有一百六十篇。
    总之，“真理报”的批评的主题是多样的，并不限于当前的中心工作。生活本身是那样的丰富多采，新与旧的斗争是那样生动尖锐，报纸不应当只关心生活的这个方面或那个方面，它应当给生活中提出的各种问题以明确的回答。当然，生活本身也表现出那些问题是主要的，那些问题是次要的，报纸应当反映出生活和斗争的真实面貌。
      主题的来源
    批评的主要根据是党的决议和政策。报刊的力量就在于它是党的机关报，就在于它坚持党性的原则。“真理报”最近时期的批评就是为动员群众胜利地完成党的第十九次代表大会和一九五三年九月中央全会的决议而斗争。党中央经常地给编辑部以具体指示，各地党组织的领导人也经常向“真理报”的地方记者指出批评的主题和对象。
    广大劳动人民的来信成为选择批评的主题和对象的最重要的来源。一九五三年“真理报”编辑部收到四十万封来信，劳动者来信部把来信中提出的各种问题登记在主题卡片上，使编辑部使用来信很方便。许多社论和论文一开头就引证了劳动者的来信。去年发表的一百二十五篇小品文就有九十多篇是根据劳动者来信写的。有些来信经过调查证实后就原信发表了，如一九五三年十二月十四日发表的“为什么沿海矿山落后？”这篇批评苏联煤矿工业部部长的信就是由矿山的工人、党委书记和社会主义劳动英雄三人联名写的。十二月十八日批评苏联建筑材料工业部的信，就是一个先进工人的来信，经过记者调查补充后发表的。
    “真理报”的地方记者也从各地写来了许多批评稿件。如去年十二月十一日发表的“诺言与现实”，就是“真理报”记者从第涅泊彼特罗夫斯克写来的，内容是批评捷尔任斯基冶金工厂厂长说了不作、完不成计划，同时也批评了苏联冶金工业部。十二月七日发表的“列宁格勒的手工业合作社能够而且应当工作得更好”，也是记者写的。
      灵活生动的形式
    “真理报”的批评，不但内容是丰富多样的，形式也是灵活生动的。
    论文、通讯、读者来信、漫画是我们比较常用来进行批评的形式，这里不多谈。
    社论中进行批评是我们采用得较少的形式。“真理报”是每天有社论，其中，讲国内问题的社论很少不讲工作中的缺点，很少不提出尖锐的批评，而且经常是指名指姓的。很容易理解，既然批评和自我批评是那样重要，而社论是每一期报纸的最重要的文章，编辑部在进行批评时是不会不采用这种形式的。
    最为读者喜爱的形式是讽刺小品。这是用文学的语言写的，有情节，有形象，它的特点是一定要有笑；笑有微笑、嘲笑、愤怒的笑。像画家选择不同的色彩一样，作家根据讽刺对象的不同选择不同的笑。“真理报”和苏联其他报刊向来重视这一尖锐的斗争武器。因为，在苏联，虽然敌对阶级消灭了，但是，苏联仍然是在资本主义的包围中，国内还有资产阶级思想残余影响，讽刺就成为打击资产阶级思想的最有力的武器。这种讽刺小品的引人注意，只需举一个例子就够明白了：在稿件拥挤的情况下，编辑部各部都自愿地把地位让给它，他们说：“没有讽刺小品，怎么办报？”
    应当说明：我国报纸经常采用发消息进行批评的形式，“真理报”是不采用的。因为消息是鼓动的一种重要形式，它要快捷简明，不宜于作调查和分析，也不可能在一条短短的消息里把事件分析清楚，而批评总是要讲道理的。因此，“真理报”和其他报刊在进行批评时不用这种形式（只有在个别情况下，消息中也顺便提一两句工作中的缺点），这样就避免了许多可以避免的缺点。
    批评稿件除社论外，一般都发表在第二版。第一版是消息。
    在党委领导下独立负责地
        正确地开展批评
    “真理报”在进行批评时是独立负责的。这就是说：“真理报”的批评对党中央负责，不受任何方面的限制。
    苏联共产党给了自己的机关报独立负责的权力和义务。报纸是保卫党、国家和人民的利益的，它应当毫无顾忌地批评党和国家工作中的缺点和错误，吸引群众参加共产主义的建设。这种批评应当是不问对象、不顾情面的，不论是大干部还是小干部，有缺点和错误就可以批评，而不必征求对方的同意。“真理报”的社论全部由自己写的主要原因就是只有编辑部才能写出客观公正的社论来；记者在地方上的活动只受编辑部直接领导，也是为了保证他进行批评时不受任何限制；报纸的通讯员也以自愿地组织在编辑部周围为原则，不属于任何别的组织。“真理报”发表批评稿件以前不需要经过任何方面的同意和批准。所有这些，都是为了保证编辑部在进行批评和自我批评中的主动性、积极性和尖锐性。
    当然，党的机关报的编辑部无权和党委对立，它不能在报纸上批评它所隶属的党委会。只有党委会自己认为必要时才可以发表批评党委会的稿件。报纸编辑部如认为有必要，可以向上级党委机关报写批评党委会的稿件。上级党委机关报对地方党委的批评，当地党委机关报必须转载。
    同时，应当说明：这绝不是说报纸编辑部可以对批评采取轻率的态度。恰恰相反，编辑部懂得自己担负的责任是十分重大的，绝不能滥用自己的权力，他们在发表稿件以前总是反复地调查事实，多方面地了解各种不同的意见，才独立负责地确定发表与否和怎样发表。
      “真理报”编辑部在处理批评稿件时表现的那种独立负责的工作精神深深地感动了我们。根据我们听到的和看到的，这种精神具体地表现在这几方面：
    第一，明确地了解批评的目的，是为了帮助党和人民纠正缺点和错误，是为了帮助党和人民推动全部工作前进。认为报纸上的批评和自我批评会给敌人利用、会使得一部分人不痛快，因而不敢开展批评和自我批评是不对的。从我们的批评和自我批评中，人民得到的营养要更多些。
    为了达到这个目的，必须区别是对敌人还是对同志。对敌人，批评是为了消灭他，而不是为了帮助他改正错误；对同志，批评是为了帮助他改正错误，而不是为了消灭他。报纸编辑部必须从党和人民的利益去考虑问题，党的报刊应当是党的意志的体现者，不能因为某人是权威就不敢批评，也不能因为和某人是朋友就不好意思批评，批评应当是不问对象、不顾情面的。但是，编辑部又必须创造性地进行工作，不能用一个尺子去衡量一切，必须是实事求是的、谨慎的、公正的。批评的口气很重要。党教导说：不要以木棒代替评论。特别是在批评人的时候，应当注意到不要损伤同志的自尊心，不允许侮辱人，而应当讲究分寸。要了解：批评别人的缺点是容易的，帮助一个同志去克服缺点却是一件很困难的事。
    这就是批评的思想性和原则性，也就是批评的党性。党一方面教育干部要正确地对待报纸上的批评，遵照斯大林同志的指示，即使只有百分之五的正确性也应当虚心接受，不要阻塞言路。另方面，党又要求编辑部坚持批评的正确性。
    第二，为了保证批评的正确性，编辑部采取了十分谨慎的态度，用十分周密细致的方法，对每一篇在报上发表的批评稿件事先都作认真的调查。只有记者写的稿件是不再调查的，因为记者都是经过严格选择，受过党的教育，懂得编辑部对他的要求的。他知道：一篇不真实的批评给报纸带来的损失是不可估量的。
      对稿件的调查包括两个项目，就是作者和事实。
    首先调查作者是谁，是不是值得把他的名字登在报上，一个人的名字登在“真理报”上应当看作一件大事，必须是政治上和道德上没有作过坏事的人，才能以作者的身份在“真理报”上和读者见面。同时，这种调查也可以防止坏人假冒别人的名字。
    其次，调查事实是否真实。苏维埃人的荣誉是：经过调查证明来信揭发的事实绝大部分是真实的。但是，不能因此不作调查。要信任，又要调查，这是铁的原则。事实也证明了这一点：调查是必需的，这不但是保证批评的真实性的前提，而且往往因为调查而使一封简单的来信变为一篇深刻的论文，读者原来指出的只是一种表面现象，论文把问题从本质上揭示出来了。“真理报”编辑部的同志告诉我们：几十年的经验证明：调查只有好处，没有坏处；不调查只有坏处，没有好处。
    调查的方法是：通过地方记者就地调查，没有地方记者的地方委托地方报纸编辑部进行调查。在调查中，要找各方面的人谈话，赞成的和反对的都找，当事人和有关的人都找；需要时也找主管部门和领导人，不是为了请他批准发表，而是为了使批评更准确。各个方面的人对这种调查都是乐于帮助的，帮助记者进行工作是一种荣誉和义务。因此，一个事件的调查并不费很长的时间。
    为了最后肯定稿件的真实性，编辑部在决定发表以前还要给作者发一个电报：“请肯定作者姓名和事实无误”，一般都收到回电：“肯定作者姓名和事实无误”，往来电报费由编辑部支付。
    第三，为了保证批评的正确，重要的批评和评论要经过编辑委员会的讨论。根据传统，马克思列宁主义的理论问题、党的建设问题、外交问题、文学艺术问题等要经过编辑委员会讨论。当然，不是一切都讨论，只是新问题要经过讨论。讨论时，要邀请评论的作者参加，这条规则被严格地遵守着。有些更复杂的不容易作结论的问题，讨论时还邀请被批评者参加。
    第四，为了保证批评的正确，特别重要的批评，编辑部要主动地向党委请示，和有关部门商量。编辑部可以随时向党委请示问题，但是，党要求编辑部更多地独立负责地处理问题，编辑部也不滥用自己的便利条件。把各种问题都向党委请示自然是很方便的，但这是一种过分简单的办法，是不成熟的表现。编辑部应当独立思考，酝酿成熟，真正成为党委的有力助手。
    和各个有关部门商量也是为了正确地判断问题。编辑部对各方面的意见是尊重的，但最后的结论由编辑部自己来作，各部门无权命令编辑部取舍稿件。因为报纸是党委的机关报，对报纸的领导统一集中于党的委员会和第一书记。
    第五，要为批评的效果而斗争。党的规定是：报纸发表了稿件，被批评的部门和领导人要开会讨论，并将讨论的结果和采取的措施通知报纸编辑部。编辑部限于报纸篇幅，只能将最重要的检讨摘要登报。现在，不检讨、不通知编辑部的事情是没有的。
    “真理报”为了保证批评得到实际效果，采取了两项措施：一是在收到对批评作形式主义的答复的信件时，再发表一篇评论作更严厉的批评；一是批评以后过一个时期再去检查实际改正得怎样。这样，被批评者就不能摆脱舆论的监督。我们在几个著名的工厂里曾经听到过这样的话：很久以前“真理报”曾批评过他们工厂，他们至今不忘，一篇批评帮助了他们许多年。
