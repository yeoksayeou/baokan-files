Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: In order to consolidate newly established agricultural production cooperatives and promote the progress of mutual aid teams, Northeast China is beginning to implement a contact system between old and new cooperatives, and between cooperatives and teams. In provinces such as Heilongjiang, Liaodong, and Liaoxi, some counties are conducting pilot programs to promote this contact system, while others have begun to promote it universally. This contact system is basically based on the village, with well-managed agricultural production cooperatives as the base. Under the leadership of the CCP village branch, and based on the principle of voluntarism, the directors of new and old agricultural production cooperatives and the leaders of mutual aid teams hold regular or irregular joint meetings to exchange experiences. In some places, cadres from village supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and agricultural technology promotion stations are also included to form mutual aid joint committees. This contact system solves the contradiction between the increasing number of agricultural production cooperatives and the shortage of leadership. It helps new agricultural production cooperatives learn management and operation, strengthens the relationship between cooperatives and teams, cultivates mutual aid and cooperation backbones, and facilitates village cadres in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After being helped by the mutual aid joint committee to solve problems such as labor organization, eight newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Chongyang Village, Qinggang County, Heilongjiang Province, smoothly transitioned to production. The Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiao Sanjia, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, discovered that the Xiao Yongfang mutual aid team in their village had not dug a water channel, and took the initiative to propose that the agricultural production cooperative's waterway temporarily irrigate the mutual aid team's land. The members of the mutual aid team stated: We must learn from the agricultural production cooperative, strive to increase production, and strive to establish a cooperative after the autumn harvest. The directors of six newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Xiabancheng Township, Chengde County, Rehe Province, felt a lack of confidence when they began planning production. After learning from the experience of the old cooperatives in the mutual aid joint committee, they gradually learned how to formulate production plans, organize production, and other tasks.

    东北农村推行新老互助合作组织联系制度
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北各地为巩固新建农业生产合作社并带动互助组前进，开始推行老社和新社、社和组之间的联系制度。在黑龙江、辽东和辽西等省，有些县正进行推广这种联系制度的试点工作，有些县已开始普遍推广。这种联系制度基本上是以村为单位，以办得好的农业生产合作社为基点，在中共村支部领导下，根据自愿的原则，由新老农业生产合作社主任和互助组组长举行定期或不定期的联席会议，交流经验。有些地方还吸收村供销合作社、信用合作社和农业技术推广站的干部参加，组成互助联合委员会。这种联系制度解决了农业生产合作社日益增多和领导力量不足的矛盾，对帮助新建农业生产合作社学会经营管理、密切社和组之间的关系、培养互助合作骨干、便利村干部领导互助合作运动等方面都有作用。黑龙江省青冈县崇阳村八个新建农业生产合作社，在互助联合委员会帮助下解决劳动组织等问题后，顺利转入了生产。热河省朝阳县萧三家团结农业生产合作社发现本村萧永芳互助组没有挖水渠，便主动提出暂由农业生产合作社的水道给互助组的土地灌溉。互助组的组员们表示：一定要向农业生产合作社看齐，努力增产，争取秋后建社。热河省承德县下板城镇六个新建农业生产合作社的主任，在开始计划生产时感觉缺乏信心。他们在互助联合委员会中学习老社的经验后，都逐渐学会了订生产计划、组织生产等工作。
