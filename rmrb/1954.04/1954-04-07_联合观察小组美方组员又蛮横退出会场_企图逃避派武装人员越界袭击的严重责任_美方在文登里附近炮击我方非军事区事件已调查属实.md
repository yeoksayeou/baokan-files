    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 6th: The U.S. members of the Second Joint Observer Team, which is supervising the Korean armistice, again resorted to their old trick of walking out of the meeting in an attempt to evade the serious responsibility of violating the armistice agreement and sending armed personnel to attack our civilian police.

    The members of the Second Joint Observer Team from both sides held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to draft a report to be submitted to the Military Armistice Commission regarding the incident on the 4th in which U.S. armed personnel attacked our civilian police east of Panmunjom.

    After the meeting began, the U.S. members tried their best to deny this serious incident of the U.S. violating the armistice agreement. He repeatedly said, "We don't know these people (referring to the U.S. armed personnel who carried out the armed attack), we don't know what they are doing, and we don't know where they went." However, during the joint investigation by both sides on the afternoon of the 4th, the testimony of our civilian police who attended as witnesses and the facts admitted by Kim Jong-geum, a U.S. armed personnel captured by our side, had all confirmed the U.S. dispatch of armed personnel to attack our civilian police, a violation of the armistice agreement. At that time, the U.S. members could neither deny these facts nor raise questions to continue questioning the witnesses, and admitted that the investigation had been completed. The facts of the U.S. violation of the armistice agreement were all there and could not be denied, but the U.S. chief member still said rudely and unreasonably: "Our side will never agree to your report, and our side will submit a unilateral report to our chief commissioner. That is all I have to say. I suggest we adjourn the meeting." Moreover, without waiting for the Korean-Chinese side's members to express their agreement, he withdrew from the meeting.

    After the meeting, our side immediately submitted the special report on this incident, which was drafted by our side but dared not be discussed by the U.S. side, to the Military Armistice Commission. After describing the circumstances of the joint investigation by both sides, the special report made the judgment: "Based on the on-site investigation, the testimony of witnesses, and the confession of the UN forces' armed personnel captured by the civilian police of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it can be clearly proved that: at approximately 20:50 on April 3, 1954, five armed personnel dispatched by the 'BMC' unit of the United Nations forces, carrying weapons, crossed the military demarcation line, illegally intruded into the part of the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and attacked the civilian police of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 6th: On the afternoon of April 4th, members of the Fifth Joint Observer Team from both sides conducted an on-site investigation into the incident of the U.S. firing shells into our demilitarized zone near Mundung-ri. The members from both sides jointly inspected various evidences such as the crater and shell fragments at the shell explosion site, and jointly questioned three of our civilian police, including Park Nam-young, who had witnessed the shell explosion. After the investigation, the U.S. members admitted that the shell was a U.S.-made 4.2-inch chemical mortar smoke shell, and admitted that it was fired from the U.S. military control area.

    企图逃避派武装人员越界袭击的严重责任
    美方在文登里附近炮击我方非军事区事件已调查属实
    【新华社开城六日电】　监督朝鲜停战的第二联合观察小组的美方组员又施美方退出会场的故技，企图逃避美方违反停战协定、派遣武装人员袭击我方民政警察的严重责任。
    第二联合观察小组双方人员在五日下午举行会议，就四日对于美方武装人员在板门店以东袭击我方民政警察的事件所进行的调查草拟提交军事停战委员会的报告。
    会议开始以后，美方组员就竭力抵赖美方的这一严重违反停战协定的事件。他一再说：“我们不认识这些人（按：指进行武装袭击的美方武装人员），我们不知道他们干什么，也不知道他们到那里去。”但是，在四日下午双方进行调查时，出席作证的我方民政警察的证词和被我方捕获的美方武装人员金正今承认的事实，都已证实了美方派遣武装人员袭击我方民政警察这一违反停战协定的事件。在当时，美方组员既无法否认这些事实，也提不出问题继续询问证人，并且承认调查已经结束。美方违反停战协定的事实俱在，不容抵赖，但是美方首席组员还是蛮横无理地说：“我方决不会同意你方的报告，我方将向我方的首席委员提交一份单方面的报告。这就是我所要讲的。我建议我们休会。”而且，他不等朝中方面的组员表示同意，就退出了会场。
    会后，我方即将我方草拟的而美方不敢加以讨论的关于这个事件的特别报告送交军事停战委员会。特别报告在叙述了双方共同调查的情形后作出判语说：“根据现场的调查、证人的证词以及为朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面民政警察所俘获的联合国军武装人员的供词，可以清楚地证明：一九五四年四月三日二十时五十分左右，五名由联合国军‘BMC’部队派遣的武装人员，携带武器，越过军事分界线，非法侵入非军事区朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军管辖下的部分，袭击朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的民政警察。”
    【新华社开城六日电】　四月四日下午，第五联合观察小组的双方组员对在文登里附近美方向我方非军事区发射炮弹的事件进行了现场调查。双方组员共同视察了炮弹爆炸地点的弹坑、弹片等各种证据，并且共同询问了曾目睹炮弹爆炸的我方民政警察朴南荣等三人。调查后，美方组员承认这发炮弹是美造四点二英寸化学迫击炮烟幕弹，并且承认是由美方军事控制地区发射过来的。
