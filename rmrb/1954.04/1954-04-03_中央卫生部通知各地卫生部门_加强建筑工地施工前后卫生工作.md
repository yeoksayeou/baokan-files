Ministry of Health Notifies Local Health Departments
Strengthen Hygiene Work Before and After Construction Site Work

The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued the "Notice on Strengthening Hygiene Work Before and After Spring Construction on Construction Sites," the full text of which is as follows:

Currently, construction sites are about to commence work one after another. In order to protect and improve the health of workers, prevent and reduce the occurrence of common diseases on construction sites (gastrointestinal infectious diseases, food poisoning, injuries, malaria, epidemic typhus), and lay a good foundation for the smooth completion of the year's engineering tasks, local health departments should strengthen the supervision, inspection, assistance, and guidance of hygiene work on construction sites before and after spring construction, and do the following tasks well:

    I. For new construction projects, contact the construction unit in advance, and based on needs and possibilities, propose improvements that meet hygiene requirements for the location and configuration of temporary sheds, dormitories, canteens, kitchens, and toilets; for cross-year projects, assist the construction unit in preparing for hygiene before resuming work, paying special attention to moisture-proofing of sheds, protection of water sources, improvement of toilets and sewage wells, disposal of garbage, and addition of drinking water equipment, so as to meet hygiene conditions as much as possible.

    II. Assist construction units in resolving the problem of necessary medical personnel and establish and improve the medical and health organization on the construction site. It is best to transfer workers for short-term first aid training (without leaving production) to do first aid work for injuries under the leadership of medical personnel.

    III. Before resuming work, mobilize the masses to carry out a general hygiene clean-up, thoroughly remove accumulated garbage and furnace ash from the winter, fill in pits and depressions, strengthen hygiene management of sheds, dormitories, canteens, kitchens, and toilets, and do a good job in environmental sanitation to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds. At the same time, sanitary treatment work such as lice eradication should be carried out.

    IV. In areas where conditions permit, medical personnel should be organized as much as possible to conduct health examinations on workers and cooks before and after construction; for those who are too weak or have serious infectious diseases and epilepsy that are not suitable for construction work, the construction unit should be advised to give necessary and appropriate treatment; preventive vaccination of typhoid fever vaccine and tetanus toxoid should be started as much as possible before construction.

    V. Unite with relevant departments to organize inspection teams, conduct a safety inspection before and after construction in accordance with the local interim measures for safety and hygiene on construction sites, put forward improvement opinions on the problems found, and urge and assist in the improvement.

    VI. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, contact should be made with the construction unit. When formulating construction plans, plans should also be formulated for hygiene measures, and hygiene propaganda and education should be vigorously carried out among the workers to improve their level of hygiene knowledge, so that they can actively participate in hygiene work; medical personnel should establish the concept of facing workers and serving production, go deep into the masses, implement the spirit of prevention first, grasp the disease situation, strengthen contact with relevant parties, do a good job in on-site health care work, and summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner.

    中央卫生部通知各地卫生部门
    加强建筑工地施工前后卫生工作
    中央人民政府卫生部“关于加强建筑工地春季施工前后的卫生工作的通知”，全文如下：
    目前各建筑工地即将相继开工，为保护和增进工人的健康，防止和减少工地多发病（胃肠传染病、食物中毒、外伤、疟疾、斑疹伤寒）的发生，给全年工程任务的顺利进行打下良好的基础，各地卫生部门应在春季施工前后，加强对建筑工地卫生工作的督促检查和协助指导，做好以下各项工作：
    一、对于新建工程应预先与施工单位联系，根据需要与可能，对暂设的工棚、宿舍、食堂、厨房、厕所的设置地点和配置情况，提出合于卫生要求的改进意见；对跨年度的工程应协助施工单位做好复工前的卫生准备工作，特别注意工棚的防湿、水源的保护、厕所和污水井的改善、垃圾的处理及饮水设备的添置等，尽量使其能合于卫生条件。
    二、协助施工单位解决必要的医务人员的问题，建立和健全工地医疗卫生组织。最好能抽调工人进行短期急救训练（不脱离生产），在医务人员领导下做外伤急救工作。
    三、在复工前发动群众进行一次普遍的卫生扫除，彻底清除冬季积存的垃圾、炉灰，填平坑洼、加强对工棚、宿舍、食堂、厨房和厕所等处的卫生管理，做好环境卫生工作，以消灭蚊蝇的孳生场所。同时应进行灭虱等卫生处理工作。
    四、有条件的地区，应在施工前后，尽可能组织医务人员对工人和炊事人员进行一定范围的健康检查；对身体过分衰弱或有严重传染疾病及癫痫等不适于建筑作业者，应建议施工单位给以必要和适当的处理；尽可能在施工前开始进行伤寒菌苗及破伤风类毒素的预防接种工作。
    五、联合有关部门组织检查组，根据当地建筑工地安全卫生暂行办法，在施工前后进行一次安全检查，对所发现的问题提出改进意见，并督促协助改进。
    六、为保证上述任务的完成，应与施工单位取得联系。在订施工计划时，对于卫生方面的措施亦须制定计划，并在工人群众中大力进行卫生宣传教育，提高其卫生常识水平，使能主动地参加卫生工作；医务人员应建立面向工人和为生产服务的观点，深入群众，贯彻预防为主的精神，掌握发病情况，加强与有关方面的联系，作好工地卫生医疗工作，并将工作情况及时总结交流经验。
