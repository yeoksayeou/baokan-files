    Must Conscientiously Study and Implement Advanced Soviet Experience
    Dong Xiuchun, Assistant Engineer and Shift Leader, Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant

    Chairman Mao wrote a letter to all of our factory workers at the end of 1952, calling on us to produce more high-quality steel. For more than a year, we have faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and are now able to produce more than 30 types of steel. Moreover, we have mastered several basic operating methods for smelting high-quality steel, laying the foundation for producing more varieties of high-quality steel in the future.

    Our factory's technical progress is the result of the Soviet experts' enthusiastic help and our wholehearted learning from the Soviet Union. Smelting high-quality steel has many new and strict technical requirements. We had never learned about these issues in school. In 1949, after graduating from school, I came to the steelmaking plant and initially only learned the Japanese's set of backward operating methods. At that time, I thought I had learned almost everything about steelmaking after learning this set of methods. But in reality, the quality of the steel we produced at that time was very poor. It wasn't until fraternal factories raised concerns, saying that the steel rails made from our steel would collapse under the pressure of a train and that the steel beams made from our steel had cracks, and that the chemical composition and physical properties of much of the steel could not meet their requirements, that we were shocked and felt helpless.

    Just then, Soviet experts arrived. They helped us formulate a new and complete set of operating procedures. This procedure was much more difficult than our old methods. At the beginning, some comrades almost lost confidence, saying that our furnaces were not good and that the Soviet procedures were not applicable and should be relaxed a bit. However, the Soviet experts always insisted on their opinions and repeatedly encouraged us, patiently explaining to us that this procedure could definitely be done, and that it was necessary to overcome the difficulties in the work in order to be able to produce other more high-quality steels in the future. With the encouragement of the Soviet experts and the support of the leading comrades, I did not give up and insisted on exploring and experimenting according to the experts' instructions. After several consecutive experiments, all failed. I kept asking the Soviet experts for advice. He was never impatient and always explained again and again with a smile. Finally, I repeatedly studied the principles he explained, overcame the shortcomings in the operation, and finally succeeded in the experiment, giving birth to the "high-temperature thin slag active boiling operation method" that was later promoted throughout the factory, laying the foundation for our factory to smelt high-quality steel.

    From the process of mastering the new operating procedures this time, I deeply realized that: to improve the technical level of our country's industry, we must learn from the Soviet Union. And almost none of the Soviet experience and the Soviet experts' suggestions are unworkable. If it cannot be done, the reason is often that we have not learned well, have not understood, and have problems in the operation. With the continuous increase of various new industrial sectors and the continuous improvement of the technical level of each industrial sector, the country's requirements for the variety and quality of steel will inevitably become more and more numerous and higher and higher. To meet such requirements, we can only learn from the Soviet Union better, seize the opportunity to have direct help from Soviet experts, and strive to learn more skills.

    Now I am in charge of the duty shift leader, and during the eight hours of the duty shift, I am entrusted by the factory director to direct the production of the entire factory. The Soviet experts' suggestions and the Soviet advanced experience must be implemented to the workers through administrative command. Therefore, I have a greater responsibility in learning and spreading Soviet advanced experience and in ensuring the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. Therefore, in future work, I will not only continue to work hard to learn Soviet advanced experience and implement every suggestion of Soviet experts without compromise, but also ensure that I educate other comrades to do the same, and drive those who are related to our work to do the same. In this way, we can contribute more to the industrialization of the motherland, and enable our factory to smelt more and better high-quality steel for the motherland.

    必须认真地学习和贯彻苏联先进经验
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂值班长助理工程师　董绣春
    毛主席在一九五二年年底写信给我们全厂职工，号召我们多炼优质钢。一年多来，我们忠实地执行了毛主席的指示，现在已经能够炼制三十多种钢了。而且，熔炼优质钢的几个基本操作方法，也已为我们所掌握，给今后炼制更多品种的优质钢打下了基础。
    我厂在技术上的进步，是苏联专家热忱帮助的结果，是我们全心全意地向苏联学习的结果。熔炼优质钢，在技术上有许多新的、严格的要求。这些问题我们过去在学校里从没有学过。一九四九年我从学校毕业来到炼钢厂，最初只学了日本人的一套落后的操作方法。当时以为学会了这一套，炼钢的本事就学得差不多了。但实际上当时炼的钢质量很不好。一直到兄弟工厂提出意见，说用我们出的钢做成的钢轨，火车一压就瘫，用我们出的钢做成的钢梁裂缝，很多钢的化学成份和物理性能不能满足他们的要求。这时候我们才大吃一惊，感到束手无策。
    就在这时，苏联专家来了。他帮助我们制订了一套新的完整的操作规程。这个规程比我们的老办法难得多。开始时，有些同志几乎丧失了信心，说我们的炉子不好，苏联的规程不适用，应该放宽
  一些。但苏联专家始终坚持他的意见，并且再三地鼓励我们，向我们耐心地解释，说这个规程是一定可以做到的，必须突破工作中的难关，才有可能在以后炼制别的更多的优质钢。在苏联专家的鼓励和领导同志的支持下，我没有泄气，坚持按照专家的指示去摸索、试验。一连试验了好几次，都失败了。我不断去找苏联专家请教。他从来没有不耐烦过，总是笑眯眯地一遍又一遍地讲解。最后，我反复钻研他所讲的道理，克服操作中的缺点，终于试验成功了，诞生了后来在全厂推广的“高温薄渣活跃沸腾操作法”，为我厂冶炼优质钢打下了基础。
    从这次掌握新操作规程的过程中，我深深体会到：要提高我国工业的技术水平，就必须学习苏联。而苏联的经验，苏联专家的建议，几乎没有一个是行不通的。如果做不到，原因往往是我们没有学好，没有领会，在操作上有毛病。随着各种新工业部门的不断增加和各个工业部门技术水平的不断提高，今后国家对钢的品种、质量等要求，必将越来越多，越来越高。要满足这样的要求，我们只有更好地向苏联学习，抓紧有苏联专家直接帮助的机会，努力学会更多的本领。
    现在我担负着值班长的职务，在值班的八小时中间，受厂长的委托指挥全厂的生产。苏联专家的建议、苏联的先进经验，都要通过行政上的指挥，才能贯彻到工人中间去。所以，在学习和传播苏联先进经验方面，在保证苏联专家建议的贯彻上，我担负的责任更重。因此，在今后的工作中，我不但自己要继续努力学习苏联先进经验，不折不扣地执行苏联专家每一个建议，而且保证要教育其他同志都这样做，带动和我们工作有关系的人也都这样做。这样，我们才能为祖国工业化贡献更多的力量，使我们工厂能够为祖国熔炼更多更好的优质钢。
