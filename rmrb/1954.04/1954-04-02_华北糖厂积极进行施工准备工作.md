    North China Sugar Factory Actively Prepares for Construction Work
    After a long period of preparation for construction, the North China Sugar Factory has decided to officially start construction this year in Baotou City.

    The newly built North China Sugar Factory will be one of the most technologically advanced and largest beet sugar factories in China today. Most of the sugar-making process will be automated. After the factory is completed, it will not only produce a large amount of granulated sugar every year to supply the needs of the people in Inner Mongolia, North China, and the whole country, but also contribute to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. According to expert surveys, it is very suitable to grow sugar beets in most areas of Baotou City suburbs, Hepingdiquan Administrative Region, and various counties and banners of Hetao Administrative Region in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In addition, the sugar factory can also provide a large amount of beet pulp to Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen to feed livestock and domestic animals, solving the problem of grass shortage.

    In order to ensure the smooth construction of the factory, the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China have listed the construction of the sugar factory as one of the key construction projects this year, and have transferred strong cadres to the site to provide specific assistance. The Baotou Municipal Committee has decided that one of the responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee will serve as the secretary of the on-site Party committee to supervise and guarantee the completion of the project. At present, with the strong support of leaders at all levels in Inner Mongolia, North China, and the central government, as well as various fraternal factories, relevant units are actively carrying out preparations before construction. A large number of steel bars, steel frames, cement, etc. required for the construction of the factory have been partially transported to the construction site, and domestic and foreign orders have also arrived at the construction site one after another.

    华北糖厂积极进行施工准备工作
    华北糖厂经过较长时期的建厂准备，决定今年在包头市正式开工兴建。
    新建的华北糖厂，将是当前我国技术设备最先进，产量最大的甜菜机制糖厂之一。制糖过程大都是自动化。该厂建成后，不仅每年将生产大量白砂糖，供应内蒙、华北和全国人民生活需要，而且有助于内蒙古自治区的农牧业发展。经专家调查，在内蒙古自治区包头市郊区和平地泉行政区、河套行政区各县旗的大部地区，种植甜菜非常适宜。此外，糖厂每年还能将大量甜菜废丝，供给蒙汉农牧民，喂养牲畜和家畜，解决缺草的困难。
    为了保证建厂工程顺利施工，中共中央内蒙古分局和中共包头市委，都把糖厂的建设列为今年基本建设重点工程之一，并抽调了强有力的干部深入现场，具体进行帮助。包头市委会决定由市委负责同志之一担任现场党委书记，监督与保证完成工程任务。目前，在内蒙、华北、中央各级领导以及各兄弟厂的大力支援下，有关单位正在积极进行施工前的准备工作。建厂所需的大批钢筋、钢架、水泥等，已部分运到工地，国内、外订货也陆续到达工地。
