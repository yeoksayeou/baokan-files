Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 21st: Spring wheat sowing in Northeast China has basically been completed, and wheat seedlings have already emerged in the southern regions. Before sowing, various localities educated farmers on timely sowing, changing the habit of delaying sowing with the saying "Sowing wheat after the Qingming Festival in March." Many mutual aid and cooperative organizations launched wheat-sowing competitions, prompting individual farmers to sow five to ten days earlier than in previous years. The wheat-sowing area in most regions exceeded the plan; in Songjiang Province alone, it exceeded the plan by more than 20,000 hectares. Reasonable close planting was widely implemented in wheat sowing in various places, and the area of seeds disinfected also increased compared with previous years. In Songjiang Province's eleven major wheat-producing counties, including Jixian, Huachuan, and Fujin, close planting accounted for more than 80 percent of the 150,000 hectares of wheat fields sown. In Songjiang Province, 56,000 hectares of wheat fields were sown using animal-drawn farm implements, and more than 50 percent of the wheat seeds were disinfected.

    东北春小麦播种结束
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北区春小麦播种基本结束，南部地区麦苗已经出土。各地在种麦前对农民进行适时播种的教育，改变了“三月清明麦在后”的拖延下种的习惯。很多互助合作组织开展种麦竞赛，带动了个体农民比往年提前五天到十天种麦。大部地区种麦面积都超过计划，仅松江省就超过计划二万多垧。各地在种麦中较普遍地实行了合理密植，种籽经过消毒的也比往年增加。松江省集贤、桦川、富锦等十一个主要产麦县播种的十五万垧麦田中，密植的麦田占百分之八十以上。松江省全省有五万六千垧麦田使用马拉农具播种，百分之五十以上的麦种经过消毒。
