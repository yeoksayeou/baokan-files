    A School on the Grassland – No. 1 Middle School of Hailar City
    The No. 1 Middle School of Hailar City in Inner Mongolia is a national middle school in our border region. Since its establishment in 1949, this school has trained 138 cadres and primary school teachers for the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, and some students have graduated and entered the Central University for Nationalities and Peking University. At present, there are eight classes in four grades with 316 students. Most of the students attending the school are children of herdsmen of Mongolian, Tungus, and Solon ethnicities. With the development of the school, new school buildings were built last year, and various teaching instruments, models, and cultural and sports equipment were added. The students are happily studying in this comfortable school.

    草原上的一所学校——海拉尔市第一中学
    内蒙古海拉尔市第一中学，是我国边疆地区的一所民族中学。这所学校自一九四九年成立以来，已先后为内蒙古牧业区培养了一百三十八名干部和小学教师，并有部分学生毕业后入了中央民族学院和北京大学。目前校内共有四个年级八个班，学生三百一十六人，参加学习的学生多是蒙古、通古斯和索伦等族的牧民子弟。随着学校的发展，去年该校修建了新校舍，添置了各种教学仪器、模型和文艺、体育用具。学生们在这所舒适的学校里都愉快地学习着。
