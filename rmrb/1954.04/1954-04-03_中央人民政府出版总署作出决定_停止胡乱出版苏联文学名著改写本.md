The Central People's Government Publishing Administration Makes a Decision
To Stop Reckless Publication of Rewritten Versions of Soviet Literary Masterpieces

In recent years, private publishers in Shanghai and other places have excessively produced many rewritten or "popular" versions based on translations and abridgments of Soviet literary works. These rewritten or "popular" versions are generally of very low quality, and some even spread erroneous ideas and knowledge, seriously damaging the ideological and artistic value of the original works, and creating chaos in publishing and distribution. The general readership and translation workers have strongly criticized the private publishers' bad practice of recklessly rewriting Soviet literary masterpieces, and demanded that the publishing authorities take appropriate action. In order to protect the interests of readers and to respect the labor of authors and translators, the Central People's Government Publishing Administration has made a decision to stop the reckless publication of rewritten or "popular" versions of Soviet literary masterpieces.

According to incomplete statistics from the Publishing Administration, approximately seventy types of Soviet novels, plays, and film scripts have been rewritten. Among them, some masterpieces that are particularly popular with the vast Chinese readership, such as "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Young Guard," and "A Real Man," have two or three rewritten versions. Many such rewritten versions seriously distort the theme and artistic images of the original works. For example, "Tempered into Steel" (百炼成钢), published by Tonglian Bookstore and rewritten based on the Chinese translation of "How Steel Was Tempered," portrays Pavel Korchagin as a character "from a petty hooligan background," and deviates from the theme, using a lot of ink to describe the obscene language of degenerate elements insulting women. "Rainbow on the Snowy Land" (雪地长虹), published by the same bookstore and rewritten based on the Chinese translation of "The Rainbow," vividly portrays the arrogance of the Hitlerite bandits, and turns the strong character of the heroic Soviet women in suffering, which the original work emphasizes, into "crying and screaming" and being weak. Many such rewritten versions destroy the ideology, artistry, and writing style of the original works; some inappropriately add embellishments to the stories, while others eviscerate the original works, making them unrecognizable and losing their spirit entirely. For example, "Cement" (士敏土), published by Jinzhang Bookstore and rewritten based on the Chinese translation of "Cement," trashes this epic masterpiece with high ideological and artistic value, leaving only the shell and losing its flesh and blood; "Clear Days" (晴朗的日子), published by Baixin Bookstore and rewritten based on the Chinese translation of "Clear Days," (百万富翁) cuts off three-quarters of the original work. Many such rewritten versions vulgarize the popularization work and force socialist realistic artistic works into the old costumes of low-grade old novels. For example, the rewritter of "Good Children" published by Jinzhang Bookstore, transforms Ostrovsky's masterpiece "Born of the Storm" into a vulgar martial arts novel; the rewritter of "Blood and Hatred" published by Xinwenhua Bookstore transforms Simonov's poetic play "Under the Chestnut Trees of Prague" into a kitschy romance novel. In the latter rewritten version, writing about women is just about "heavy makeup" and "a slight flush on their cheeks," and writing about love between men and women is just about "regretting not meeting sooner," "a broken heart," and "the falling flowers have their hearts set on the flowing water, but the flowing water is heartless." Many of the rewritten or popular versions adopt the format and layout of inferior episodic novels, using many rigid antithetical phrases as chapter titles, and using many clichés to fill the chapters. All these rewritten or popular versions cause unacceptable damage to the noble artistic works of Soviet writers, and do not benefit our readers in any way.

The proliferation of these rewritten or "popular" versions fully reflects the speculative, opportunistic, and shoddy style of the rewritters and publishers. Among the more than sixty rewritten or popular versions published and distributed by Tonglian Bookstore, about half were completed by one or two rewritters in about two years. This "speed" of rewriting shows that the rewritters do not need to treat rewriting work as a serious mental labor. In this case, it is only natural to provide some extremely low-quality reading materials. Plagiarizing and repackaging the text of translated versions to make a rewritten version, in order to speculate and profit, has also become common practice. This illegal act of plundering the labor achievements of translation workers and infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of publishers is also unacceptable.

Introducing foreign literary works in a popular form, especially introducing the world's most advanced Soviet literary works, requires extremely serious and creative labor, and requires a high degree of political and artistic accomplishment. The rewritters of the low-quality rewritten or "popular" versions that are popular on the market today can never undertake such a significant task. The trend of recklessly producing these rewritten or popular versions has damaged and harmed Soviet writers and works, the learning needs of the vast readership in our country, and the rights and interests of translation workers and legitimate publishers. Therefore, the Publishing Administration issued instructions to local news and publishing administrative organs in January of this year regarding the cessation of recklessly publishing rewritten or popular versions of Soviet literary masterpieces. The instructions stipulate that, in the future, except for individual books that truly need and can be adapted, and that are specially approved by the Publishing Administration or the publishing administrative organs of large administrative regions, and that have obtained the consent of the original publisher and the original author or original translator, popular versions, adapted versions, and other books that alter literary masterpieces shall generally not be published. As for the various rewritten or popular versions of Soviet literary works that have already been published, no further editions are allowed. Those already published may be allowed to be sold until they are sold out.

### 中央人民政府出版总署作出决定  停止胡乱出版苏联文学名著改写本

    中央人民政府出版总署作出决定
    停止胡乱出版苏联文学名著改写本
    上海等地的私营出版商，近年来滥出了许多根据苏联文学作品中译本改写和缩写的改写本或“通俗本”。这些改写本或“通俗本”，质量一般都很低劣，有的还传播了一些错误的思想和知识，严重损害了原著的思想性和艺术性，并造成出版发行工作的混乱现象。广大读者和翻译工作者对私营出版社这种胡乱改写苏联文学名著的恶劣作风，纷纷提出指责，要求出版主管机关进行适当处理。中央人民政府出版总署为保护读者利益，并尊重作者和译者的劳动，已作出停止胡乱出版苏联文学名著改写本或“通俗本”的决定。
    据出版总署不完全的统计，约有七十余种苏联的小说、剧本和电影剧本经过改写。其中某些特别受到中国广大读者欢迎的名著，如“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“青年近卫军”“真正的人”等，则有两三种改写本。不少这样的改写本严重地歪曲了原著的主题思想和艺术形象。例如通联书店出版的“百炼成钢”（根据“钢铁是怎样炼成的”中译本改写），把保尔·柯察金刻画成为一个“小瘪三出身”的人物，并离开主题思想，用很多笔墨描写蜕化分子侮辱女性的下流话；这个书店出版的“雪地长虹”（根据“虹”的中译本改写），把希特勒匪帮的嚣张写得有声有色，把原著中所着重表现的苏联英雄妇女在苦难中的坚强性格，写成“大哭大叫”、软弱无力。不少这样的改写本破坏了原著的思想性、艺术性和著作的风格，有的在故事中不恰当地添枝加叶，有的把原著抽筋剥皮，弄得面目全非，精神尽失。例如锦章书局出版的“士敏土”（根据“士敏土”中译本改写），把这一部具有高度思想性和艺术性的史诗式的巨著，蹧蹋得只留下了躯壳，失去了血肉；百新书店出版的“晴朗的日子”（根据“晴朗的日子”即“百万富翁”中译本改写），割去了原著四分之三的篇幅。不少这样的改写本把通俗化工作庸俗化，把社会主义现实主义的艺术作品硬给穿上低级的旧小说的古装。例如锦章书局出版的“好儿女”的改写者，把奥斯特洛夫斯基的名著
  “暴风雨所诞生的”改成为一本庸俗的武侠小说；新文化书社出版的“血与仇”的改写者把西蒙诺夫的富于诗意的剧本“在布拉格栗树下”改成了一个恶俗的言情小说。在后一个改写本里，写女性就是“浓装艳抹”“微泛红霞”那一套，写男女爱情就是“相见恨晚”“柔肠寸断”“落花有意，流水无情”那一套。有许多的改写本或通俗本采用了下等的章回小说的体裁和布局，用许多僵化了的对仗词句作为回目，用许多陈词滥调来填塞篇章。所有这些改写本或通俗本都使苏联作家的高贵艺术作品受到不能容许的破坏，也使我国读者得不到一点益处。
    这些改写本或“通俗本”的泛滥情形充分反映出改写者和出版者的投机取巧、粗制滥造的市侩作风。在通联书店出版和发行的六十余种改写本或通俗本中，约有一半以上是一两个改写者在约两年的时间中完成的。这种改写的“速度”说明改写者不需把改写工作当作一种认真的精神劳动。在这种情况下，只能提供出一些质量极其低劣的读物，是很自然的。剽袭和改头换面地拼凑译本的文字成为一个改写本，借以投机牟利，也是相习成风。这种掠夺翻译工作者的劳动成果和侵犯正当出版者的权益的非法行为，也是不能容许的。
    用通俗的形式介绍外国文学作品，特别是介绍世界上最先进的苏联文学作品，需要极其严肃的创造性的劳动，需要高度的政治修养和艺术修养。今天流行在市场上的、质量低劣的改写本或“通俗本”的改写者是决不可能承担这样具有严重意义的工作的。这些改写本或通俗本的滥出倾向，对苏联的作家和作品，对我国广大读者的学习要求，对翻译工作者和正当出版者的权益，都是起了损伤和有害的作用的。因此，出版总署在今年一月份已向各地新闻出版行政机关发出关于停止胡乱出版苏联文学名著改写本或通俗本的指示。该指示中规定：今后除个别书籍确有改编的必要和可能，经出版总署或大行政区出版行政机关特许，并取得原出版者和原作者或原译者同意外，一般地不得出版苏联文学名著通俗本、改编本及其他改窜文学名著的书籍。至于已出版的各种苏联文学作品的改写本或通俗本，一律不准再版。已出版者可准予售完为止。
