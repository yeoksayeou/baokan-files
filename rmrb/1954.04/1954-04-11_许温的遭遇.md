Xu Wen's Plight
Hu Sisheng

Recently, an event occurred in France that has drawn considerable attention from public opinion in capitalist countries. Marshal Juin, Inspector General of the French Armed Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Land Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, delivered speeches on March 27th and 31st, opposing the "European Army" treaty. He stated, "Many clauses of the 'European Defense Community' treaty are inapplicable," and it is a "mistaken approach" that puts France at a disadvantage.

Evidently, Juin spoke the truth on this matter and voiced what had long remained unspoken in the hearts of some French generals and officers. As he himself stated, he delivered speeches opposing the "European Army" treaty to "clarify the intolerable ambiguity that has existed for a long time."

Of course, such remarks could not but enrage the French ministers who depend on US "aid" for survival. How dare France's renowned contemporary general, France's only remaining marshal, who was recently touted by American newspapers as a rather "loyal" French "number one soldier," publicly oppose the "European Army" treaty! Consequently, after an emergency meeting on March 31st, the French cabinet announced the removal of Juin from all his senior military positions in France. Parisian newspapers also predicted that Juin's position as Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Land Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would also be revoked.

Of course, this is not an accidental or isolated event.

As everyone knows, the US government, determined to maintain tension and deepen the division of Europe, has recently intensified its pressure on the French ruling clique, which accepts US "aid," in an attempt to force France to ratify the "European Army" treaty before the Geneva Conference. According to French democratic newspapers, the United States has even stipulated a specific timetable for the French government to take action, requiring the French parliament to finally approve the treaty before the Easter recess (scheduled to begin on April 16th). Dulles himself also sent a telegram to Bidault, demanding in the tone of an ultimatum that the French parliament ratify the "European Army" treaty around Easter. Under pressure from the United States, reactionary politicians in France who support the "European Army" treaty are frantically working for the American timetable. However, mainly due to the increasingly strong opposition from the broad masses of the French public, the American and French reactionary politicians are increasingly feeling that the "American timetable" for approving the "European Army" treaty is clearly in danger of being completely disrupted. They are becoming increasingly anxious, troubled, and uneasy, like ants on a hot pot.

Undoubtedly, Juin's remarks against the "European Army" treaty added fuel to the fire. The French parliament was already in a state of serious division on the question of whether to approve the "European Army" treaty. Therefore, as a United Press reporter lamented: "Because of Juin's high status in the French military, because he is the commander of the important central region of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defense, and because those who support this controversial treaty often cite his words, his remarks may have dealt a fatal blow to the possibility of France ratifying the European Defense Community."

Therefore, Juin's plight was predictable. In the so-called "free world," those who speak the truth become guilty. French Prime Minister Laniel also had to admit that it was impossible for Juin to "speak his conscience" while he "held his former high military positions."

Moreover, this is by no means a personal matter. It reflects the enormous change in the balance of political forces in France on the issue of ratifying the "European Army." As everyone knows, recently, the growing opposition to the "European Army" treaty in France has come not only from the vast masses of workers and working people but also from within the bourgeois groups. Increasingly, clearer-headed people in French political and military circles realize that participating in a "European Army" dominated by a West German army led by former Hitlerite generals means that France will lose control of its own army and be at the mercy of former Hitlerite generals, so that France will not have its own national army.

The Juin incident once again demonstrates that the "European Army" treaty runs counter to France's national dignity and interests. If the French ruling clique dares to act arbitrarily and ratify the "European Army" treaty, it will cut itself off from the French people and isolate itself completely.

    许温的遭遇
    胡思升
    最近，法国发生了一件使资本主义国家舆论极为注意的事件。法国武装部队总监、北大西洋集团中欧区陆军总司令许温元帅在三月二十七日和三十一日接连发表演说，反对“欧洲军”条约。他说：“‘欧洲防务集团’条约的许多条款是不适用的”，它是使法国吃亏的“错误做法”。
    很显然，在这个问题上，许温是说了真话，而且是说出了在一些法国将领和军官心中长期没有说出的真话，正如他自己所说的，他所以发表反对“欧洲军”条约的演说，是为了要“澄清许久以来存在的难以容忍的暧昧情况。”
    当然，这样的谈话，就不能不使靠美“援”过活的法国部长们勃然大怒了。因为法国当代著名的将领、法国仅存的元帅最近还被美国报纸标榜为一个相当“忠实”的法国“第一号军人”，竟然胆敢公开反对“欧洲军”条约！于是，法国内阁在三月三十一日举行紧急会议后，宣布撤除许温在法国各高级军事机构中的各项职务。巴黎的报纸并预料，许温所担任的北大西洋集团中欧区陆军总司令一职也会被撤除。
    当然，这不是偶然的孤立的事件。
    大家知道，最近以来，一心要维持紧张局势、加深欧洲分裂的美国政府，加紧对接受美“援”的法国统治集团行使压力，想迫使法国在日内瓦会议前批准“欧洲军”条约。据法国民主报刊报道，美国甚至规定了法国政府采取行动的具体时间表，要法国议会在复活节休会（预定在四月十六日开始）前最后批准这个条约。杜勒斯也亲自打电报给皮杜尔，以最后通牒的口吻要法国议会在复活节左右批准“欧洲军”条约。在美国的压力下，法国国内支持“欧洲军”条约的反动政客们正在紧张地为美国的时间表而奔忙。但是，主要是由于法国广大阶层的公众愈来愈强烈的反对，美国和法国的反动政客们愈来愈感到批准“欧洲军”条约的“美国时间表”显然有被彻底打乱的危险，他们正像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，愈来愈感到一阵阵逼来的焦急、烦恼和不安。
    无疑地，许温反对“欧洲军”条约的谈话是加在“热锅”下的一把干柴。法国议会在是否应该批准“欧洲军”条约的问题上本来就陷于严重的分裂局面，因此，正如合众社记者所悲叹的：“由于许温在法国军界中的崇高地位，由于他是北大西洋公约组织防务的重要的中部地区的司令，而且由于支持这个引起争论的条约的人们经常引证他的话，所以他这次谈话可能已对法国批准欧洲防务集团的可能性给了致命的打击。”
    因此，许温的遭遇是可以意料的。在所谓“自由世界”里，说了真话的人就会变成有罪的人了。法国总理拉尼埃也只得承认，在许温“身居以往的军事高职时”，是不可能让“他说良心话”的。
    而且，这绝不是一桩个人的事件。这反映出目前法国在批准
  “欧洲军”问题上的政治力量对比关系的巨大变化。大家知道，最近以来，法国对于“欧洲军”条约日益增长的反对，不仅来自工人和劳动人民的广大群众之中，而且也来自资产阶级集团之中。法国政界和军界中头脑比较清醒的人愈来愈明确地认识到：参加一支以前希特勒将领为统率的西德军队占优势的“欧洲军”，就意味着法国将丧失对自己军队的控制权而听命于前希特勒将领，这样法国就将没有自己的国家军队了。
    许温事件再一次说明，“欧洲军”条约是和法国的民族尊严和利益背道而驰的。法国统治集团如果敢于一意孤行，批准“欧洲军”条约的话，就是自绝于法国人民，陷自己于完全孤立的境地。
