Farmers in Jingyang, Xingping, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Lintong and other counties in southern Shaanxi, after receiving patriotic education on increasing cotton production to support national construction, have reversed the trend of reducing cotton field planting areas. Many cotton farmers are actively plowing cotton fields and irrigating them, striving for early sowing.

In order to fulfill the state's plan to increase cotton production this year, the Xingping County People's Government convened a meeting of more than 320 cotton farmer representatives on April 2 to publicize the cotton planting policy. Representatives from the seventh and ninth districts, which are suitable for cotton planting, not only formulated individual plans to restore cotton fields at the meeting, but also planned to expand the cotton field area by 3% to 9% compared to last year. After discussion among the representatives, the cotton field area has been expanded from more than 6,600 mu last year to more than 6,700 mu, an increase of 687 mu compared to the original plan for this year. The agricultural technology guidance stations in the second, third, and eighth districts of Jingyang County conducted general line education to more than 200 cotton farmers by imparting cotton cultivation techniques. The county people's government recently held a forum for county-level cotton planting models and mutual aid team leaders. At the meeting, many cotton farmers proposed to change early autumn crops to cotton, which could increase cotton fields by more than 400 mu. Sanyuan County also recently held a county-level people's representative meeting and the second mutual aid team leader training class, repeatedly discussing the issue of stabilizing cotton fields. Many representatives and mutual aid team leaders proposed to change sweet potato fields and melon fields to cotton fields, and expressed that they would definitely publicize the appropriate expansion of cotton fields to support national industrial construction to the farmers when they return.

In order to solve the difficulties of grain and fertilizer shortages for cotton farmers, all counties have made full preparations. Xingping County supplied 800,000 jin of corn to cotton farmers and other grain-deficient households in various villages, alleviating the concerns of cotton farmers who were afraid of not having enough grain if they planted more cotton. The county supply and marketing cooperative also prepared 550,000 jin of oil cake to help cotton farmers solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. In addition to timely supplying a large number of commercial fertilizers to cotton farmers, supply and marketing cooperatives in Jingyang and other counties also actively organized local oil mills to process oil cake to meet the fertilizer needs of cotton farmers. At the same time, the Jinghui Canal Cotton Planting Technology Guidance Committee and the agricultural technology guidance stations of various counties have dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to help cotton farmers solve technical problems such as the use of cotton strip sowing machines and seed dressing with medicines, so as to ensure the timely sowing of cotton.

    陕西省泾阳等县扭转缩减棉田的趋势
    陕西南部泾阳、兴平、三原、高陵、临潼等县农民，受过增产棉花支援国家建设的爱国主义教育后，已经扭转了缩减棉田种植面积的趋势，许多棉农正积极翻犁棉田，进行灌溉，争取提前播种。
    为了完成国家今年增产棉花的计划，兴平县人民政府于四月二日召开了全县三百二十多名棉农代表会，宣传了植棉政策。适宜植棉的七区和九区代表，在会上不但订出了个人恢复棉田的计划，并且还计划争取比去年棉田面积扩大百分之三到百分之九。代表们讨论结果，棉田面积已由去年六千六百多亩扩大到六千七百多亩，比今年原计划增加了六百八十七亩。泾阳县二、三、八等区的农业技术指导站，通过传授棉花耕作技术分别向二百多棉农进行了总路线的教育，该县人民政府又于最近召开全县植棉模范、互助组长座谈会，在会上许多棉农们都提出将早秋作物改种棉花，共可增加四百余亩棉田。三原县最近也召开了县各界人民代表会议和第二次互助组长训练班，反复讨论了稳定棉田问题，许多代表和互助组长提出可将红苕地、瓜地改成棉田，并表示回去一定好好向农民宣传适当扩大棉田支援国家工业建设。
    各县为了解决棉农缺粮和缺肥料的困难，都作了充分的准备，兴平县把八十万斤玉米供应各村缺粮的棉农和其他缺粮户，解除了棉农怕多种棉花没粮吃的顾虑。该县供销合作社还准备了五十五万斤油渣，帮助棉农解决肥料不足的困难。泾阳等县供销合作社除将大批商品肥料及时供应了棉农外，还积极组织当地油房进行油渣加工，满足棉农施肥的需要。同时，泾惠渠植棉技术指导委员会和各县农业技术指导站都抽出大批干部下乡，帮助棉农解决使用棉花条播机、药剂拌种等技术问题，以保证棉花适时下种。
