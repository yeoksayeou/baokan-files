The Tuli River, Yituli River, Kuduer, Arxan and other Forest Industry Bureaus in Inner Mongolia are actively preparing for rafting operations, utilizing "Peach Blossom Water" for timber transportation.

According to the resolution of the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Administration's rafting conference, the aforementioned forest industry bureaus all established rafting preparation committees in early March, and began planning and organizing the supply of materials such as tools and tents necessary for rafting operations. Currently, the installation projects for out-of-river machines and sky bridges in various forest areas are nearing completion. River pushing will begin successively in mid-to-late April.

In addition to paying attention to improving and strengthening the rafting organization, the Tuli River Forest Industry Bureau also anticipated that the light snowfall last winter might result in a smaller "Peach Blossom Water" flow, affecting river pushing. Therefore, after the river survey work was completed, they organized more than 300 workers to start ice-breaking operations on the one hand, and on the other hand, they worked hard to repair various rafting tools such as tripods and five water dams, so that they could make full use of the "Peach Blossom Water" once it arrived.

This is the first time for the Yituli River Forest Industry Bureau to raft timber. In the rafting preparation work, it focused on re-measuring the rafting river channel, which has now been completed. According to the river conditions, three sluice gates and an out-of-river dam have been repaired, and the installation of out-of-river machines and the sky bridge project for out-of-river use are also nearing completion.

The Kuduer Forest Industry Bureau completed the survey of the Urqihan River in early March, and is currently carrying out ice channel digging and river repair work. The Arxan Forest Industry Bureau called on all employees to concentrate all their efforts to complete the rafting task ahead of schedule.

    内蒙古各林区利用“桃花水”流送木材
    内蒙古图里河、伊图里河、库都尔、阿尔山等森林工业局正积极准备流送作业，利用“桃花水”进行流送。
    根据内蒙古森林工业管理局流送会议的决议，上述几个森林工业局都在三月上旬，先后成立了流送筹备委员会，着手筹划、组织流送作业中所必需的工具、帐篷等物资供应。目前各林区的出河机安装工程与天桥工程都将要完工。在四月中下旬即先后开始推河。
    图里河森林工业局今年除注意健全与加强流送组织机构外，并估计到去年冬季雪少，一旦桃花水小，将会影响推河的情况。所以在河川调查工作结束后，一方面组织三百余名工人开始刨冰作业，另一方面，抓紧修理各项流送工具如三角架、五道水坝等。以便桃花水一下来就能充分利用。
    伊图里河森林工业局今年初次流送，在流送准备工作中着重流送河道的重新测量，这一工作现已完成。根据河流情况已修好三道水闸、出河坝，出河机安装与出河用的天桥工程也即将完工。
    库都尔森林工业局已在三月上旬结束乌尔其汗大河的勘查工作，目前正进行打冰道及修河作业。阿尔山森林工业局号召全体职工集中一切力量提前完成流送任务。
