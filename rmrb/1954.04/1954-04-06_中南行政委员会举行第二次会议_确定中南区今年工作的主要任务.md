Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 5th: The second meeting of the Central-South Administrative Committee was held from March 29th to 31st. Attending the meeting were Vice Chairmen Zhang Nanxian, Li Xiannian, Li Xuefeng, Chen Mingshu, and 46 members. Also present were the heads of various committees, bureaus, departments, and offices. Based on the general line of the state during the transition period, the meeting reviewed and summarized the work of 1953 and determined the tasks for the Central-South Region in 1954.

At the meeting, Li Xiannian delivered a report on the "Summary of Work in 1953 and Future Tasks." The report emphasized that in the first year of the state's First Five-Year Plan for economic construction, the Central-South Region achieved great successes in various areas: In terms of capital construction, efforts were concentrated on ensuring the completion of key construction projects, and the quality of most projects was good, basically achieving the target figures. In terms of industrial production, the total output value increased by 29.2 percent compared to 1952. Among these, state-owned industries increased by 36.22 percent, joint state-private industries increased by 35.53 percent, cooperative-run industries increased by 65.97 percent, private industries increased by 14.39 percent, and individual handicrafts increased by 32.66 percent. In terms of agricultural production, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of the entire region overcame various serious disasters and finally achieved a bumper harvest. The total annual output increased by 6.49 percent compared to 1952. By the end of last year, the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in agricultural production throughout the region had reached 10,310,000 farm households, accounting for approximately 27.56 percent of the total number of farm households in the region, an increase of 10 percent compared to 1952. In addition, trial work on basic-level elections was conducted in various parts of the region, and the working style of cadres at all levels was further improved. The regional autonomy of minority nationalities areas has been basically completed, and significant achievements have been made in the economic, cultural, educational, and health work in these areas. In terms of cultural, educational, and health work, the consolidation and strengthening of school education, focused development, and mass patriotic health campaigns were completed. Significant achievements were also made in other areas such as transportation, finance, banking, and trade. This has prepared favorable conditions for the second year of the state's First Five-Year Plan. On this basis, there is full confidence in successfully completing the glorious tasks that should be completed in 1954.

Li Xiannian proposed that the main tasks for the Central-South Region this year are: 1. In accordance with the requirements of the state's general line during the transition period, and following the central government's guidelines of "placing capital construction in a primary position" and "firstly ensuring key construction" and "exploiting the potential of existing factories and mines," continuously improve labor productivity, continue to strengthen the leadership of capital construction work for new and expanded factories and mines, and at the same time strengthen the planning work for key urban construction, mobilize forces from all aspects to support capital construction, and require existing factories and mines to strengthen enterprise management and comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plan. 2. In the agricultural sector, actively and steadily develop the movement of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production, continuously improve agricultural productivity to ensure the needs of national economic construction, and gradually improve the lives of farmers. 3. In a planned and steady manner, increase the proportion of socialist economic components in commodity circulation and strengthen its leading role; implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of private industry and commerce; do a good job in the unified purchase and sale of grain; support the development of cooperative undertakings; practice strict economy, increase income, accumulate funds to ensure key national construction; maintain price stability, and gradually meet the growing needs of the people's lives. 4. Fully promote democracy, complete the basic-level elections in the entire region, verify the population; and convene people's congresses at all levels in a timely manner to further improve the people's democratic system and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. 5. Promote various cultural and educational undertakings and vigorously cultivate various talents needed for national construction. Finally, he proposed that it is necessary to strengthen the education of the general line among the broad masses of cadres and the broad masses of the people, strengthen political work and ideological leadership on various work fronts, so that every task can advance accurately in the direction indicated by the general line.

The meeting conducted a warm discussion on the above report. Ji Wenfu, Hou Lianying, Wang Renzhong, Nie Guoqing, Tang Xing, Li Renren, Huang Qixiang, Zhang Zhen, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Jingshe, Xu Chongqing, Pan Zinian, Wang Yizhai, Liu Yifeng, Chen Cisheng, Huang Changshui, and other members spoke successively and unanimously agreed with the tasks for the Central-South Region in 1954 proposed by Li Xiannian.

Li Xiannian made a concluding speech. He said that this meeting was filled with an atmosphere of emphasizing economic construction. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have struggled arduously for decades to build our country into a socialist country. Li Xiannian emphasized that when we are carrying out socialist construction, the enemy will try every possible means to sabotage it. Only by raising revolutionary vigilance can we ensure the victorious completion of socialist construction and smash all the enemy's conspiracies. Finally, he emphasized that strengthening unity, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, continuing to improve the work style, and giving full play to collective strength can overcome any difficulties in the way forward and can successfully complete the tasks for 1954.
