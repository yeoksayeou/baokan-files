How the Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate Work
	陶伟

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate were officially established around October of last year. Their main tasks are: (1) to handle cases of counter-revolutionaries sabotaging railway transportation; (2) to handle major train accidents caused by railway employees seriously violating operating procedures, resulting in significant losses to railway property or endangering personal safety; (3) to handle commercial accidents where the state bears huge compensation due to serious irresponsibility; (4) to handle cases of embezzlement and theft; (5) to handle cases of non-railway personnel stealing or defrauding railway equipment and goods. By the end of last year, they had accepted 74 cases, including counter-revolutionary cases, embezzlement and theft cases, and major liability accidents. Through the inspection and trial of these cases, as well as the public pronouncements of judgments on several major typical cases, conducting publicity and organizing studies, the broad masses of railway workers have improved their political vigilance, received education on revolutionary legal systems and labor discipline, further recognized the harm of irregular operations and dereliction of duty to national economic construction, and improved their production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. In coordinating judicial work with the current central task of the Railway Bureau – increasing production and practicing economy to ensure national economic construction – it has achieved good results.

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court began its trial operation around July of last year. First, a temporary trial group was formed by the Tianjin Municipal People's Court and the Tianjin Railway Administration, jointly drawing a group of cadres who were politically reliable and had a high level of professional competence. The temporary trial group first organized forces to investigate the situation of various types of cases that had occurred over the years and in various movements in the Tianjin Railway Administration and its seven subordinate branches in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Guye, and Xinxiang (the number of subordinate branches has now been reduced to four). Judging from the results of the investigation, the Tianjin Railway Administration has made significant achievements in completing and over fulfilling the state's railway transportation production tasks over the years, but the losses caused to the railway industry by the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements are also serious; embezzlement and theft have been repeatedly discovered after the "Three-Anti" movement; various types of liability accidents have occurred continuously, and the causes of the accidents are mainly due to human work errors such as work negligence and violations of operating procedures. Through this investigation, not only was there a preliminary grasp of the development law of various types of cases along the Tianjin Railway Line in the past and the main problems currently existing, but at the same time, the urgent need to strengthen judicial work in economic departments such as railways was more deeply experienced.

While carrying out the investigation work, the temporary trial group began to accept cases with emphasis, and before the official establishment of the special court, it successively accepted 24 cases. In handling these cases, it was felt that in order to better use the legal weapon to protect railway transportation production, it was necessary to establish prosecution work at the same time. Therefore, the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate drew cadres and established a prosecution team to try out prosecution work.

During the trial period, through the inspection and trial of key cases, cadres initially became familiar with the business and explored some case-handling experience. On this basis, the special court and special procuratorate were officially established.

The establishment of special courts and special procuratorates is a new task. Cadres are drawn from the railway, court, and procuratorate in three aspects. There is neither a set of ready-made experiences, nor a comprehensive understanding of judicial and railway business. Therefore, it is appropriate to formally establish special courts and special procuratorates after a period of trial operation.

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate adopted a prudent and steady approach in handling cases. In addition to severely suppressing counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage activities, they treated the illegal activities of general workers differently according to the nature and circumstances of the incident. For incidents that are not very serious in nature and the circumstances are relatively minor, the focus is on education; only individual elements who seriously violate the law and repeatedly refuse to be reformed are given necessary legal sanctions. The practice is: to inspect major liability accidents such as train operation and casualties that occur at the moment, select those with serious losses, clear responsibilities, and bad circumstances, the special procuratorate investigates and prosecutes, and the special court tries the case. This is because the special court and special procuratorate are newly established and lack work experience. The cases that occur in the railway system are often complex and involve a wide range of issues, and the trial takes time; at the same time, railway workers are also unfamiliar with the special court and special procuratorate, and it is necessary to be more cautious when handling cases. On the other hand, some workers and individual departments often one-sidedly emphasize education and are unwilling to give necessary legal sanctions for major liability accidents with serious crimes, on the grounds that "this is not counter-revolution" and "it is an internal affair of the working class." It is necessary to persuade them through accurate analysis of specific cases and specific circumstances, explaining that the purpose of punishment is not only to educate the perpetrators themselves, but also to educate the broad masses of workers, safeguard state property, and protect the personal safety of other workers. Experience has proved that this approach is correct, which not only punished a few elements who have consistently violated operating procedures and caused serious consequences, but also educated the majority of workers.

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate solicited the opinions of the party and government leaders of the Railway Bureau on the prosecution and sentencing of major liability accident cases that require legal sanctions. Doing so can avoid or reduce errors and avoid one-sidedness and limitations in work. At the same time, they also closely cooperated with the relevant departments of the Railway Bureau in handling cases to obtain more sufficient technical and legal basis. For some complex technical cases, it is easy to distinguish the facts. In addition, before the prosecution and trial of the case, the case was also taken to the relevant unit's workers and masses to discuss under leadership, so that the opinions of the special court, the special procuratorate, and the railway bureau leaders on the handling of the case were consistent with the opinions of the workers, and the support of the workers was obtained.

The route under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Railway Administration is very long, from Shanhaiguan in the north to Xinxiang in the south. In order to prevent the trial work from affecting production and to facilitate clarifying the case and handling the case correctly and in a timely manner, the special court adopted the working method of on-site trial for general cases. Also, because various liability accident cases involve more technical issues, it is not enough to rely solely on the specialized knowledge of the judges, and jurors with specialized business knowledge must be invited to participate in the trial work. This not only facilitates the smooth trial of the case, but also strengthens the connection between the special court and the workers and masses, and expands the impact of legal education. In particular, some criminals think that the special court personnel are not familiar with the technology and arbitrarily quibble, and only when skilled workers or engineers participate in the jury can they honestly admit their mistakes. The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court has selected 17 temporary jurors from the units and regions where the cases occurred through key case handling. In the production of jurors, three methods have been adopted: universal election, leadership designation, and leadership nomination and mass approval. Among the three methods, the latter method is more appropriate, which does not affect production and can educate the masses.

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate have also successively selected 12 cases of major train operation, casualty accidents, and embezzlement, theft, and sabotage of railway lines, etc., and convened eight public sentencing conferences in the relevant units and stations, with more than 7,500 people directly participating in the conferences. After the meeting, the party committee of the relevant unit organized the workers to discuss. Such selection of typical cases for public trial and organization of workers to discuss can further expand the effect of legal publicity. After the public sentencing of Bai Fengqi's major case of train overturning caused by irregular operation, the Political Department of Tianjin Railway Administration issued instructions, stipulating that nearly a month of political study time should be used to organize all employees to study and discuss, and combined with the inspection and criticism of the ideological style of irregular operation and dereliction of duty, to cooperate with and promote the central task of increasing production and practicing economy. As a result of the strengthening of the workers' sense of responsibility after the study, He Jingqiao, a worker at Xinhe Station, prevented a fatal accident in November last year, and Gao Weihan prevented a train derailment accident.

The Tianjin Railway Line Special Court and Special Procuratorate adopt a joint office approach, with the responsible comrades of the two agencies forming a core group to uniformly lead and carry out work. The effect of this is very good. Because the cases accepted by the special court on the railway are all criminal cases, it requires an agency to handle public prosecution, and most cases are not as obvious as general criminal cases, and it is even more necessary to go through careful investigation to determine the responsibility and criminal circumstances before prosecution. This work needs to rely on the special procuratorate to carry out. The special procuratorate has not been established for a long time, and the prosecution scope should not be too wide. It should mainly cooperate with the special court in handling cases, and implement prosecution and prosecution with emphasis according to the scope of cases under the jurisdiction of the special court. Therefore, the work of the special court and the special procuratorate must closely cooperate and work together to handle key cases well. After having a common impact and some work experience, the special procuratorate will gradually expand the prosecution business. However, this has also produced some biases that emphasize unified integration and ignore the supervisory role of the special procuratorate over the special court.

    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署是怎样进行工作的
  　陶伟
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署于去年十月间正式成立，它的主要任务是：（一）处理反革命破坏铁路运输的案件；（二）处理铁路职工因严重违犯操作规程致使铁路财产蒙受重大损失，或危及人身安全的重大行车事故；（三）处理因严重不负责任致使国家承担巨大赔偿的商务事故；（四）处理贪污、盗窃案件；（五）处理非铁路人员盗骗铁路器材、货品的案件。至去年年底，受理了反革命案件、贪污盗窃案件及重大责任事故等七十四个案件。通过对这些案件的检察、审理，以及对若干重大典型案件的公开宣判、进行宣传和组织学习，使广大铁路职工提高了政治警惕性，受到了革命法制和劳动纪律的教育，进一步认清了违章作业、玩忽职守对国家经济建设的危害，提高了生产积极性和责任心，在从司法工作配合该路局当前中心工作——增产节约、保障国家经济建设上，收到了良好的效果。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院从去年七月间开始试办，先是由天津市人民法院与天津铁路管理局共同抽调一批政治上可靠和有较高业务水平的干部组成临时审判组。临时审判组首先组织力量对天津铁路管理局及其所辖北京、天津、张家口、太原、石家庄、古冶、新乡七个分局（现在所辖分局已减为四个）历年来和历次运动中发生过的各类案件情况，进行了调查。从调查结果看，天津铁路管理局历年来在完成与超额完成国家的铁路运输生产任务上有显著的成绩，但是反革命分子的破坏给铁路事业造成的损失也是严重的；贪污、盗窃行为在“三反”运动以后仍屡有发现；各类责任事故不断发生，而造成事故的原因，主要是由于工作疏忽、违反操作规程等人为的工作过失。经过这次调查，不仅初步掌握了过去天津铁路沿线各类案件发展的规律和当前存在的主要问题，同时更深刻地体验到在铁路等经济部门迫切需要加强司法工作。
    临时审判组在进行调查工作的同时，即有重点地开始受理案件，到正式成立专门法院前，先后共受理了二十四件案件。在处理这些案件中感到：为了更好地运用法律武器保障铁路运输生产，有同时建立检察工作的必要，因而又由天津市人民检察署抽调干部，建立了检察组，试办检察工作。
    在试办期间，经过对重点案件的检察、审判，干部初步熟习了业务，并摸索出一些办案经验。在这个基础上，就正式成立了专门法院和专门检察署。
    创建专门法院和专门检察署是一项新的工作，干部是从铁路、法院、检察署三方面调来的，既没有一套现成的经验，对司法业务和铁路业务也缺乏全面的了解，因此，经过一个时期的试办，然后正式成立专门法院和专门检察署，是适当的。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署在处理案件上采取了慎重稳进的方针，除对进行破坏活动的反革命分子予以严厉镇压外，对于一般职工的违法事件则根据事件的性质和情节有区别地对待。对性质不甚恶劣，情节比较轻微的事件，着重进行教育；只对个别严重违法、屡教不改的分子给以必要的法律制裁。其作法是：对现时发生的行车和伤亡等重大责任事故进行检查，选择其中损失严重、责任明显、情节恶劣的，由专门检察署侦察起诉，由专门法院审理。这是因为专门法院和专门检察署开始创建，本身还缺乏工作经验，而发生在铁路系统的案件，又往往是情节复杂、牵连面广，审理费时；同时铁路职工对专门法院、专门检察署也很生疏，处理案件时就需要更加慎重。另一方面，有的职工和个别部门对罪情严重的重大责任事故，也常以“这不是反革命”、“是工人阶级内部的事”为理由，而片面强调教育，不愿予以必要的法律制裁。这就必须通过对具体案件、具体情节的确切分析来加以说服，说明惩罚的目的不单是教育犯罪者本人，而且还是为了教育广大职工，维护国家财产，保障其他职工的人身安全。经验证明，这样的做法是正确的，既制裁了少数一贯违章作业、造成严重恶果的分子，又使多数职工受到了教育。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署对需要法律制裁的重大责任事故案件，在起诉和量刑上都请示了路局的党政领导，征求他们的意见，这样做可以不犯错误或少犯错误，避免工作上的片面性和局限性。同时，在处理案件时还和路局各有关部门密切配合，取得技术上和法律上的更充分的根据。对某些复杂的技术案件，易于辨明事实。此外，在案件起诉和审判之前，还把案件拿到有关单位职工群众中有领导地进行讨论，这就使专门法院、专门检察署、铁路局领导上对案件的处理意见与职工的意见取得一致，获得职工群众的拥护和支持。
    天津铁路管理局所辖路线很长，北至山海关，南至新乡，为了使审判工作不影响生产和便于弄清案情，及时正确地处理案件，专门法院对一般案件都采取了就地审理的工作方法。又因为各种责任事故案件技术性问题较多，仅靠审判人员的专门知识还不够，必须邀请有专门业务知识的陪审员参加审判工作。这样既便于案件的顺利审理，又能加强专门法院和职工群众的联系，扩大法制教育的影响。特别是某些犯人以为专门法院人员不熟悉技术，任意狡赖，必须有技术工人或工程师参加陪审，才能使他们老老实实承认错误。天津铁路沿线专门法院通过重点办案，从各案所发生的单位和地区，已选出临时陪审员十七名。在陪审员的产生上，曾采取过普遍选举和领导指定，以及领导提名、群众通过等三种作法。在三种办法中，后一种办法是较适宜的，既不影响生产，又能教育群众。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署还先后选择了重大行车、伤亡事故及贪污、盗窃、破坏线路等十二件案件，分别在有关单位和站段，召开了八次公开宣判大会，直接参加大会的有七千五百多人。会后，均由有关单位党委组织职工进行讨论。这样选择典型案件公开审判，并组织职工讨论，更可扩大法纪宣传的效果。白凤岐违章作业造成列车颠覆的重大案件公开宣判后，天津铁路管理局政治部曾为此发布指示，规定以将近一个月的政治学习时间，组织全体职工学习讨论，并结合检查与批判违章作业、玩忽职守的思想作风，配合与推动增产节约的中心任务。由于学习后职工责任心加强，新河站工人何景桥在去年十一月份防止了一件死亡事故，高维汉防止了一件火车脱轨事故。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院和专门检察署是采取合署办公的方式，由两个机关的负责同志组成核心小组，统一领导，进行工作，这样做的效果很好。因为专门法院受理铁路上的案件都是刑事案件，需要一个办理公诉的机关，而多数案件又不像一般刑事案件那样罪责显明，更需要经过细密的侦察，判明责任和犯罪情节，才好起诉。这项工作需要依靠专门检察署来进行。专门检察署也因成立不久，检察面不能过宽，主要应配合专门法院办案，依专门法院管辖案件的范围，有重点地实行检察、起诉。因此专门法院和专门检察署的工作必须密切配合，共同为办好重点案件而努力，待有共同的影响和一些工作经验后，专门检察署再逐步扩展检察业务。但这样做也曾产生过一些因强调统一结合而忽略了专门检察署对专门法院监督作用的偏向。
