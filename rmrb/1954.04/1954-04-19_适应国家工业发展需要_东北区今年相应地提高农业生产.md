Adapting to the Needs of National Industrial Development
    The Northeast Region Will Increase Agricultural Production Accordingly This Year

    With the development of national industry, agricultural production in the Northeast will be further increased accordingly this year. The region plans to produce 22.4 million tons of grain this year, an increase of 20.5 percent over the actual output in 1953. Among them, the main commodity grain—soybeans—is planned to produce 3,994,000 tons, an increase of 12 percent over 1953. According to the needs of national industrial development and the improvement of people's lives, it is planned to sow 300,000 hectares of cotton (an increase of more than 20,000 hectares over last year), and produce 233,000 tons of seed cotton (an increase of more than 40,000 tons over last year); at the same time, it is planned to produce 71,465 tons of flax; it is planned to produce 1,029,150 tons of sugar beets; and produce 25,500 tons of tobacco.
    The widespread development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement will play an important role in ensuring the realization of the agricultural production increase plan. At present, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region has developed to 17,067, and the number of new ones this year is 2.4 times that of 1953 (4,926); the total number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 4.56 percent of the total number of agricultural households. While developing agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups in various places have also been greatly developed and improved. This year, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the region will increase from 73 percent to 80 percent. The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is more conducive to the adoption of new agricultural technologies and experiences. This year, the region will continue to effectively promote technical reforms centered on the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience on 15 to 20 percent of the cultivated land area. State-owned mechanized farms are planned to increase from 24 to 32 this year, cultivating 84,517 hectares of land.
    The rapid development of national industry will provide agriculture with more agricultural tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers this year. This year, the region has continued to promote 3,000 sets of new-style horse-drawn farm tools on the basis of promoting more than 4,600 sets of new-style horse-drawn farm tools in the past few years; the number of pesticides and chemical fertilizers has also increased. The main pesticides such as Ceresan and copper sulfate alone have increased from more than 62,000 kilograms last year to more than 65,000 kilograms. The promotion of soybean rhizobium has been inoculated on 40 percent of the soybean area last year, and it can be increased to more than 50 percent this year. In order to strengthen agricultural technical guidance, the number of agricultural technology promotion stations in the region has increased to 903 last year, and it is planned to continue to establish 224 stations this year. The 39 agricultural machine tractor stations in the region will add 306 tractors this year to strengthen their forces and expand the area of ​​cultivation on behalf of farmers. In addition, five tractor repair and fitting stations will be built.
    In order to protect the harvest of farmland, the region will promote more than 3,500 waterwheels, dig more than 7,000 wells and springs, and build small canals and use various water diversion methods, which will free 70,000 to 80,000 hectares of land from the threat of spring drought and ensure timely sowing. In addition, the earthwork for water control projects in the region will reach more than 2 million cubic meters, and more than 40 bank protection and groin projects will be built, focusing on drainage projects, which will ensure that more than 1 million hectares of farmland will be free from flooding in ordinary floods.

    适应国家工业发展需要
    东北区今年相应地提高农业生产
    随着国家工业的发展，今年东北农业生产将相应地进一步提高。全区今年计划生产二千二百四十万吨粮食，比一九五三年实产量增加百分之二十点五。其中主要商品粮食——大豆，计划生产三百九十九万四千吨，比一九五三年增加百分之十二。根据国家工业发展和人民生活提高的需要，计划播种棉花三十万垧（比去年增加二万多垧），生产籽棉二十三万三千吨（比去年增加四万多吨）；同时计划生产亚麻七万一千四百六十五吨；计划生产甜菜一百零二万九千一百五十吨；生产烟草二万五千五百吨。
    保证农业增产计划的实现，今年互助合作运动的广泛开展将起着重要作用。目前全区农业生产合作社已发展到一万七千零六十七个，今年新建的为一九五三年（四千九百二十六个）的二点四倍；总计参加农业生产合作社的农民，已占农业总户数百分之四点五六。在发展农业生产合作社同时，各地互助组也有很大的发展和提高，今年全区参加互助合作组织的农户，将由百分之七十三，增加到百分之八十。互助合作运动的发展，更有利于采用新的农业技术和经验。今年全区将继续在百分之十五至二十的耕地面积上切实推行以肇源丰产经验为中心的技术改革，国营机械化农场，今年计划由二十四个发展到三十二个，耕种八万四千五百一十七垧地。
    国家工业的迅速发展，今年将供给农业更多的农具、农药和化学肥料。今年全区在几年来推广四千六百多套新式马拉农具的基础上，又继续推广了三千套；农药和化学肥料也增多了，仅赛力散、硫酸铜等主要农药即由去年六万二千多公斤增加到六万五千多公斤，大豆根瘤菌的推广，去年有百分之四十的大豆面积进行了接种，今年便可增加到百分之五十以上。为加强农业技术指导，去年全区农业技术推广站已发展到九百零三个，今年计划继续建立二百二十四个站。全区三十九个农业机器拖拉机站，今年将增加三百零六台拖拉机，以充实力量，扩大代耕面积，另外将修建五个拖拉机修配站。
    为保护农田丰收，全区今年推广水车三千五百多台，凿井浚泉七千多处，修筑小型渠道及利用各种引水方法，将使七、八万垧地免除春旱威胁，得到适时播种。另外全区治水工程土工将达二百多万立方公尺，并修筑护岸、丁坝等工程四十多处，重点进行排水工程，将保证百余万垧农田在普通洪水情况下免受水淹。
