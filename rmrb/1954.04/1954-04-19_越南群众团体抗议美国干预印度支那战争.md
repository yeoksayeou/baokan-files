Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 17th, Vietnamese mass organizations are responding to the movement initiated by the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front to oppose U.S. interference in the Indochina war of aggression.

    Hoang Minh Chinh, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Youth Federation, representing Vietnamese youth, said: The recent actions of the American interventionists have completely exposed the United States'sinister policy of intervention. American warmongers are not only forcing Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian youth to die for them, but are also forcing French and American youth to serve as cannon fodder. He emphasized: Faced with the cunning schemes of the United States, Vietnamese youth have unprecedentedly consolidated their ranks, further strengthened their solidarity with the youth and people of Cambodia and Laos, and with peace-loving youth and people around the world, and are resolutely fighting for genuine national independence, unity, democracy, and peace.
    Phan Thi An, Secretary-General of the Vietnam National Committee for the Protection of Children, protested: In Vietnam, American-supplied aircraft used by the French colonialists have bombed and destroyed dikes, canals, and religious buildings. Due to the bombing and strafing by American-made aircraft, children in many places cannot attend school during the day, and some children have been burned alive by American-made napalm bombs. Recently, the American imperialists have supplied the French aggressors with even more weapons and aircraft to massacre the children and people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, thereby causing more grief and suffering in these three countries. Phan Thi An said: On behalf of the Vietnam National Committee for the Protection of Children, I accuse the French and American warmongers of their crimes to mothers all over the world, especially mothers in the United States and France, and demand that they stop the executioners' evil claws.

    越南群众团体抗议美国干预印度支那战争
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十七日讯：越南群众团体响应越南国民联合战线全国委员会扩大会议决定发起的反对美国干预印度支那侵略战争的运动。
    越南青年联盟总书记黄明正代表越南青年说：美国干涉者最近的行动，已经完全暴露了美国罪恶的干涉政策。美国战争贩子不仅强迫越南、高棉和寮国青年去为他们送死，而且还迫使法国和美国青年去充当炮灰。他强调说：面对美国的狡猾阴谋，越南青年空前地紧密了自己的队伍，进一步地加强了与高棉、寮国青年和人民、与全世界爱好和平的青年和人民的团结，坚决地为真正的民族独立、统一、民主与和平而斗争。
    越南全国保卫儿童委员会总书记潘氏安抗议说：在越南，美国供给法国殖民者的飞机轰炸并炸毁了堤坝、水渠和宗教建筑。由于美制飞机的轰炸和扫射，许多地方的儿童不能在白天上学，并已有一些儿童被美制凝固汽油弹活活烧死。最近，美帝国主义者又以更多的武器和飞机供给法国侵略者来屠杀越南、高棉和寮国的儿童与人民，从而在这三个国家造成更多的悲伤和痛苦。潘氏安说：我代表越南全国保卫儿童委员会向全世界的母亲，特别是美国和法国的母亲控诉法、美战争贩子的罪行，并要求她们制止刽子手的魔掌。
