    How to Hold a Good General Meeting of Party Members in Government Branches
    Chen Yunpeng, Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Directly Subordinate Organs of the CPC, Songjiang Province
    Article 17 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China clearly stipulates that the highest leading body of Party organizations at all levels is the general meeting of all Party members—in the branch. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his book "On the Party": "The method of incorporating Party members into several groups within the Party branch should be adopted, which is convenient and useful for work, but the role of the group should not be overemphasized. Many tasks should not be decentralized to the groups, but should be carried out by the branch in a unified and concentrated manner. Only when it is inconvenient for the branch to carry out tasks in a concentrated manner should they be decentralized to the groups." It can be seen from this that the activities of the Party's primary organizations should take the general meeting of Party members as the main form of activity. To take the general meeting of Party members as the main form of activity, on the one hand, is to better enable Party members to exercise their rights: participate in free and practical discussions on the implementation of Party policies; elect the branch committee; make suggestions and statements to any Party organ up to the Central Committee; and criticize any Party workers at the meeting, thereby giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of Party members. On the other hand, it is because the branch is the Party's primary organization, while the group is not only not the Party's primary organization, but also not a Party organization at any level. It is only for the convenience of certain tasks that Party members are divided and formed into several groups. Of course, this cannot take the group as the main form of activity and carry out too many activities. In addition, it is also because Party members in government branches are relatively concentrated and easy to concentrate for activities, and branch committee members personally grasp, study, and discuss issues, and arrange branch work, which can not only strengthen the specific leadership of the branch committee, but also improve the quality and efficiency of branch work.
    Since the organizational activities of Party organizations in government departments should take the general meeting of Party members as the main form of activity, how can we hold a good general meeting of Party members in government departments? According to our exploration in this period, we feel that the following issues need to be resolved:
    First, we must clarify the important significance of the general meeting of Party members, which is the ideological foundation for holding a good general meeting of the branch. The general meeting of Party members is a school for ideological and political training of Party members, the highest authority of the Party's primary organizations, an important method for Party members and the masses to inspect and supervise the activities of Party leaders, and an important form for embodying the Party's democratic centralism, promoting democracy, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. As Lenin pointed out: In addition to using other methods to give play to the initiative of Party members, it is absolutely necessary to convene Party members' meetings more frequently and extensively. Party members' meetings occupy an important position in improving the work of the Party. This shows the important role of Party members' meetings in the actual activities of primary Party organizations. However, some of our branches do not recognize this, and therefore do not regard the general meeting of Party members as the main form of activity of the primary organization. Analyzing the reasons, in addition to insufficient understanding of the important significance of the general meeting of Party members, some branches also have the idea of trying to save trouble, being afraid of trouble, and mistakenly believing that it is only necessary to hold a general meeting of Party members when there are serious problems. For example, Gong Airu, secretary of the United Front Work Department branch of the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee, said: "The reason why our branch committee members are unwilling to hold a general meeting of the branch and are willing to hold a group meeting is because group meetings do not require any preparation, while general meetings of the branch must be well prepared." Zhao Yunlian, deputy secretary of the Songjiang Provincial People's Bank branch, said: "We believe that general meetings of the branch should only be held when there are very serious matters, and general matters can be resolved in groups!" This incorrect understanding must be corrected. All practical work is specific, practical, and troublesome. There is no easy and satisfactory revolutionary work. The so-called trivial matters are not worth holding a general meeting of the branch is also inappropriate. The issue is not the size of the matter, but whether the matter has universality and educational significance. If the matter has universality and educational significance, even if it is a trivial matter, a general meeting of the branch should be convened to resolve it. Malenkov pointed out at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The brilliance of leadership lies in its ability to see danger in its infancy and prevent it from developing into a threat." ("Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress") It can be seen from this that pushing so-called trivial matters to the group, and waiting until the problem becomes serious or a shocking event occurs before convening a general meeting of the branch is not only irresponsible to Party members, but also a manifestation of abandoning leadership and putting work in a passive position. Therefore, to overcome this harmful idea, we must widely use the general meeting of the branch as the main form of activity of the primary Party organization.
    Second, preparing well for the meeting is one of the important conditions for holding a good meeting. After determining the issues to be discussed at the meeting, a report should be prepared, which is an important method to guide Party members to correctly discuss the issues; it is also an important method to enable the general meeting of Party members to conduct discussions at a high ideological level. In order to prepare well for the meeting, we must rely on activists and widely absorb Party members to participate in the preparation work of the meeting. For example, understanding the opinions and requirements of Party members and the masses, etc. In order to enable Party members to be ideologically prepared, the issues to be discussed at the general meeting of Party members should be notified to all Party members at least one day in advance, so that all Party members can deliberate and prepare. Many branches are already doing this, so the meeting is relatively successful. Before the Songjiang Provincial Highway Bureau branch held a general meeting of the branch to criticize Shen Yongxun's ideology, it notified the issues to be discussed to Party members and conducted deliberations among Party members before holding the meeting. Therefore, the meeting was very successful. Three-quarters of the Party members actively expressed their opinions at the meeting, which thoroughly exposed and criticized Shen Yongxun's erroneous ideology. Shen Yongxun himself also made a relatively profound self-criticism. After the meeting, Party members reflected: "This kind of meeting really solves problems." Conversely, some branches do not do this, and convene meetings temporarily. Party members do not understand the content of the meeting and have no way to prepare, and few opinions are expressed, and the meeting is dull. It can be seen from this that ideological deliberation and full preparation among Party members before the meeting is an indispensable condition and step for holding a good meeting. However, it must also be pointed out that it is wrong for some Party members not to care about the issues discussed at the general meeting of the branch, not to prepare opinions in advance according to the issues notified by the branch, and not to actively speak at the meeting, adopting a liberal attitude of "not being concerned with oneself, hanging high", and should also be corrected. On the other hand, branch committee members should first conduct detailed discussions and research on the issues to be resolved at the meeting in the branch committee, put forward preliminary opinions, and designate a special person (branch committee member) to report to all Party members on behalf of the branch committee before the general meeting of the branch can be discussed and finally made a resolution. This not only enables the meeting to proceed in an orderly manner, but also saves time and solves problems.
    Third, we must correctly determine the content of the general meeting of the branch. At present, the content of most general meetings of the branch is limited to summarizing and arranging work, building the Party, transferring Party membership, and conveying instructions from higher levels. These contents are of course necessary, but it is obviously not enough to completely limit them to these contents. We must also discuss and resolve the actual problems existing in the Party organizations of government departments. In fact, Party members are dissatisfied with the general meeting of the branch only resolving these problems, and they require the general meeting of the branch to resolve more problems. And some of our branches have a very poor understanding of this point. They reflect: "There is no other content for the general meeting of the branch except for these contents." This is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the content of the general meeting of the branch. What should the content of the general meeting of the branch be? Comrade Stalin said: All important issues related to the Party's policies and the Party's practical work that are of interest to Communist Party members should be discussed at the Party members' meeting. It can be seen from this that the content of the general meeting of the branch is very broad. The branch committee should correctly select the main and universal issues among them as the content of the general meeting of the branch based on the Party's central tasks and each political movement during each period, and in combination with the actual problems existing among the Party members of the branch, so that the content of the general meeting of the branch can be very rich. However, it is not appropriate to discuss too many issues at each meeting. With fewer issues, they can be discussed, studied, analyzed, criticized, and resolved in detail and thoroughly, with great educational significance, and the meeting time will not be too long.
    Fourth, we must earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism at the general meeting of the branch, especially criticism from below. This is the key to holding a good general meeting of the branch. However, it is not easy to achieve this. Since the first Party Congress of directly subordinate organs of Songjiang Province, most Party members have a further understanding of criticism and self-criticism, but they are still not good enough at using this weapon. For example, the disunity among some Party members in the Songjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company branch is very serious and has affected the work, but every time a group meeting, branch committee meeting, or general meeting of the branch is held, most Party members remain silent, and even if someone speaks, they cannot express their opinions on the issues. These examples are countless. The main reason for this situation is that some Party members have a wrong understanding of criticism, such as being afraid of hurting feelings and being afraid of retaliation, and therefore adopt a liberal attitude. This not only makes it impossible to carry out criticism at the general meeting of the branch, but also affects the Party's unity. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "It is a corrosive agent that makes unity disintegrate, relations relax, work become passive, and opinions diverge. It makes the revolutionary ranks lose strict organization and discipline, policies cannot be implemented to the end, and the Party organization is isolated from the masses led by the Party." ("Combat Liberalism") Therefore, each of our Communist Party members must correct this wrong attitude and follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: "A Communist Party member should be open-minded, loyal, active, take the interests of the revolution as the first life, subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolution; adhere to the correct principles at all times and in all places, and wage tireless struggles against all incorrect ideas and behaviors, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party, consolidate the connection between the Party and the masses; care more about the Party and the masses than about oneself, and care more about others than about oneself. Only in this way can one be considered a Communist Party member." (Ibid.) Comrade Mao Zedong's clear instructions are the starting point for each of our Communist Party members to observe all issues and the criterion for our words and actions. Therefore, when we carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, it is very necessary to review Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions.
    In order to carry out criticism from below, Party members in charge of administration must actively participate in the general meeting of Party members (those with special circumstances may ask for leave). This can not only listen to Party members' opinions and criticisms on administrative work, but also set an example by making prepared speeches and self-criticisms to break the ideological concerns among Party members and widely carry out criticism from below. If Party members in charge of administration do not humbly consider and study the criticisms and suggestions raised by Party members regarding individuals or organs, or verbally welcome criticism but actually stifle criticism and ignore criticism, then small problems in the work will gradually develop into large and serious shortcomings or mistakes. This has been repeatedly confirmed by facts. Each of our Party members in charge of administration should remember this lesson.
    Finally, the issues studied and discussed at the general meeting of Party members should be made correct resolutions, calling on all Party members to actively implement and seriously treat them. This is an indispensable step to consolidate the results of the general meeting of Party members. Most of our general meetings of Party members also make resolutions, but these resolutions have a common shortcoming, that is, they are general and generalized. For example, the Songjiang Provincial Finance and Planning Committee branch general meeting put forward a study plan for Party member cadres, which was also approved by all Party members, but the plan did not clearly stipulate specific requirements and deadlines for completion (later revised). Such resolutions are not only difficult for Party members to implement, but also difficult for the branch to inspect, and the plan is easy to fail and become a formality. In addition, some branches and Party members do not treat the resolutions of the general meeting of Party members seriously enough. For example, the Songjiang Provincial Department Store branch general meeting resolved that each Party member should understand the opinions and requirements of non-Party cadres. After the meeting, some Party members carried out the work according to this resolution, while some Party members did not do so, and the branch did not inspect it. For example, in the Songjiang Provincial People's Bank branch, in the development of Party work, the branch general meeting resolved that Party members should be assigned to cultivate non-Party activists, but some comrades did not implement this resolution at all. The Songjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions branch also has the same situation. This practice actually weakens the leadership role of the branch and must be changed. To change this situation, the following must be done: First, when making resolutions, we must first consider the opinions and suggestions put forward by Party members at the meeting, and then consider the intentions of the Party's leading organs, and be good at organically combining the opinions and suggestions of Party members with the intentions of the leadership, and then make resolutions. Such resolutions are more correct. Second, the resolutions of both the general meeting of the branch and the branch committee should be specific and clear, not only to determine the tasks, put forward the requirements, and stipulate the deadline for completion, but also to designate the person in charge. Third, the branch committee cannot arbitrarily add, delete, or modify the resolutions passed by the general meeting of Party members. If there are problems in the implementation, the branch committee can discuss and make appropriate revisions or supplements, and then declare to the general meeting of Party members. Fourth, after the resolutions of the general meeting of the branch or the branch committee are determined, all Party members should be called upon to actively implement them and treat them seriously. During this period, branch committee members should carefully inspect and urge all Party members to actively strive to achieve the resolutions of the branch.

    怎样开好机关支部党员大会
    中共松江省直属机关委员会副书记  陈云鹏
    中国共产党党章第十七条明确规定了：各级党的组织之最高领导机关，在支部—是全体党员大会。刘少奇同志在“论党”一书上讲：“在党的支部之内，将党员编入若干小组的办法，是应该采用的，对工作有些便利，有些作用，但不应该过分强调小组的作用，不应将许多工作分散在小组去进行，而应由支部统一地集中地去进行，只有由支部集中进行不方便的，才分散到小组去进行。”由此可见，党的基础组织的活动，应以支部党员大会为主要活动形式。要以支部党员大会为主要活动形式，一方面是为了更好地使党员运用与行使自己的权利：参加关于党的政策的实施问题之自由的切实的讨论；选举支部委员会；向党的任何机关直至中央提出建议和声明；在会议上批评党的任何工作人员，从而发挥党员的积极性与主动性。另一方面，是因为支部是党的基础组织，而小组不仅不是党的基础组织，而且也不是党的一级组织，只不过是为了某些工作方便才将党员划分开，编成若干小组。这当然就不能以小组为主要活动形式，进行过多的活动。此外，也由于机关支部的党员是比较集中的，易于集中活动，而支部委员亲自掌握研究与讨论问题，布置支部工作，不仅能加强支委会的具体领导，而且也会提高支部工作的质量与工作效率。
    既然机关党的组织活动，应以支部党员大会为主要活动形式，那么如何开好机关支部党员大会呢？据我们这一个时期的摸索，感到需要解决以下几个问题：
    首先要明确支部党员大会的重要意义，是开好支部大会的思想基础。支部党员大会是党员思想政治锻炼的学校，是党的基层组织的最高权力机关，是党员群众检查和监督党的领导者活动的重要方法，是体现党的民主集中制、发扬民主、开展批评与自我批评的重要形式。正如列宁所指出的：除了用其他方法发挥党员的自动性外，更经常更广泛地召集党员大会，是绝对必要的。在改善党的工作中党员大会占有重要地位。这就表明了党员大会在基层党组织的实际活动中的重要作用。然而我们有些支部并不是这样来认识的，因而没有把支部党员大会作为基层党的主要活动形式。分析其原因，除对党员大会的重要意义了解不够以外，有些支部还存在着图省事、怕麻烦，以及错误地认为有了严重问题才需要开支部党员大会的思想。比如松江省委统战部支部书记弓霭茹说：“我们支部委员所以不愿开支部大会愿开小组会，是因为小组会不用什么准备，支部大会得很好准备。”松江省人民银行支部副书记赵云连说：“我们认为开支部大会得有非常严重的事情，一般的事情放到小组去解决就行啦！”这种不正确的认识必须加以纠正。一切实践工作都是具体的、切实的、而且都是很麻烦的，轻松的、如意的革命工作是没有的。所谓小事不值得开支部大会也是不妥当的，问题不在于事情的大小，而在于这件事情是否带有普遍性与教育意义，如带有普遍性而有教育意义的事情，即使是小事也应当召开支部大会来解决。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上指出：“领导的英明就在于它能够把危险在萌芽中即行看出，并不使其发展成为一种威胁。”（“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”）由此可见，把所谓小事推到小组去做，而等问题严重了，或是出了惊人的事件，再召开支部大会，这不仅是对党员不负责，同时也是放弃领导，使工作处于被动的表现。因此，要克服这种有害的思想，广泛地运用以支部大会的形式为基层党的主要活动形式。
    其次，做好会议的准备，是开好会议的重要条件之一。在确定会议要讨论的问题之后，就要准备好一个报告，这是引导党员正确讨论问题的重要方法；也是使党员大会能否在高度思想水平上进行讨论的重要方法。为要做好会议的准备工作，就要依靠积极分子，广泛吸收党员参加会议的准备工作。例如了解党员群众中的意见与要求等等。为要使党员有思想准备，应将支部党员大会讨论的问题，最晚在一天前通知给全体党员，使全体党员酝酿准备。现在已有不少支部是这样做的，因此，会议开得就比较成功。松江省公路局支部在开支部大会批判沈永勋的思想之前，就将所要讨论的问题通知给党员，在党员中间进行酝酿，而后开会。因此，会议开得很好，会上有四分之三的党员都积极发表了意见，这使沈永勋的错误思想得到彻底的揭发与批判，沈永勋本人也做了比较深刻的检讨。会后党员反映：“这种会真解决问题”。相反地，有些支部不这样做，临时召集会议，党员不了解会议的内容，无从准备，发表意见很少，会议开得沉闷。由此可见，会前在党员中间进行思想酝酿和充分准备，是开好会议不可缺少的条件与步骤。但也必须指出某些党员不关心支部大会讨论的问题，事先不按支部通知的问题准备意见，会上不积极发言，抱着
  “事不关己，高高挂起”的自由主义态度，也是错误的，也应当纠正。另一方面，支部委员应当把会议上要解决的问题先在支委会上进行详细的讨论与研究，提出初步意见，并指定专人（支部委员）代表支委会向全体党员报告支部大会才能展开讨论，最后做出决议。这样使会议不但能有顺序的进行，同时还节省时间与解决问题。
    第三，要正确地确定支部大会的内容。目前大多数支部大会的内容局限在总结布置工作、建党、转党、传达上级指示上，这些内容当然是需要的，但完全限制在这些内容上，显然是不够的，还必须讨论解决机关党组织内实际存在的问题。事实上，党员对支部大会仅仅解决这些问题，感到不满意，他们要求支部大会解决更多的问题。而我们有些支部对这一点认识是很差的，他们反映：“支部大会除了这些内容没有别的内容啦。”这主要是对支部大会的内容了解的不够清楚。支部大会的内容应该是那些呢？斯大林同志讲：凡是共产党员感兴趣的一切有关党的政策和党的实际工作的重要问题，都应该在党员大会上讨论。由此可见，支部大会的内容是非常广泛的，支部委员会应该根据每个时期党的中心任务与每个政治运动并结合本支部党员中间存在的实际问题，正确地选择其中的主要而带普遍性的问题，作为支部大会的内容，这样就能使支部大会的内容十分充实。但每次会议讨论的问题不宜太多。问题少了，才能详细讨论、研究、分析、批判、解决得透澈，教育意义大，而且也不至于把会议时间开得过长。
    第四，支部大会上要认真开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。这是开好支部大会的关键。然而要做到这点却很不容易，从松江省直属机关第一届党代大会以来，多数党员对于批评与自我批评虽然有了进一步的认识，但运用这一武器还是很不够的。如松江省医药公司支部有些党员之间的不团结现象很严重，并已影响到工作，但每到开小组会、支委会、支部大会，多数党员却默默不言，即使有人发言也不能针对问题表示意见。这些实例是举不胜举的。所以会造成这种情况，主要原因是有些党员对批评存在着错误认识，如怕伤感情，怕报复，因而采取了自由主义的态度。这不仅使支部大会展不开批评，而且影响了党的团结。毛泽东同志曾指出：“它是一种腐蚀剂，使团结涣散，关系松懈，工作消极，意见分歧。它使革命队伍失掉严密的组织和纪律，政策不能贯彻到底，党的组织与党所领导的群众发生隔离。”（“反对自由主义”），因此，我们每个共产党员必须要纠正这种错误态度，并按毛泽东同志指出的：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”（同上）毛泽东同志这一明确的指示就是我们每个共产党员观察一切问题的出发点，也是我们言语行动的准绳。因此，我们在开展批评与自我批评特别是自下而上的批评时，重温毛泽东同志的这一指示是很有必要的。
    为了开展自下而上的批评，行政负责的党员，必须积极参加支部党员大会（有特殊事情者可请假），这不仅可以倾听党员对行政工作方面的意见与批评，而且还应以身作则地作有准备的发言和自我批评，以打破党员之间的思想顾虑，广泛开展自下而上的批评。行政负责党员如果对党员提出来有关个人或机关的批评建议，不虚心考虑、研究，或者口头上欢迎批评而实际上却窒息批评，对批评漠然置之。那么就会使工作中的小毛病逐渐发展成为大的严重的缺点或错误。这是被事实一再证实了的。我们每个行政负责的党员应当记取这一教训。
    最后，支部党员大会上研究与讨论的问题，要作出正确的决议，号召所有党员积极执行与严肃的对待。这是巩固支部党员大会成果不可缺少的步骤。我们现在多数的支部党员大会上也作出了决议，但这些决议都有一个共同的缺点，就是笼统
  一般化。例如松江省财经计划委员会支部大会提出了党员干部的学习计划，也经全体党员通过了，但计划上却没有明确规定具体要求与完成的期限
  （后来已修正）。这样的决议不仅党员不好执行，支部也无法检查，计划容易落空和流于形式。此外有些支部与党员对待支部党员大会的决议是不够严肃的，如松江省百货公司支部党员大会决议每个党员要了解非党干部的意见与要求。会后，有些党员是按这一决议进行了工作，有些党员就没有这样做，支部也未检查。又如松江省人民银行支部，在发展党的工作上，支部党员大会决议党员分工培养非党积极分子，但有的同志根本没有执行这一决议。松江省总工会的支部也有同样的情形。这种做法实际是削弱了支部的领导作用，是必须改变的。要改变这种情况，必须做到：第一，做决议时首先要考虑到党员在会上提出的意见和建议，然后再考虑到党的领导机关的意图，并且要善于把党员的意见、建议与领导上的意图有机地结合起来，再作出决议，这样的决议才是比较正确的。第二，无论是支部大会或支委会的决议都应当具体、明确，不仅要确定任务，提出要求规定完成的期限，而且还要指定负责人。第三，凡是经过党员大会通过了的决议，支部委员不能任意增删与修改，如执行中有问题，可经支委会讨论，作适当的修改或补充，然后要向党员大会声明。第四，支部大会或支委会的决议确定后，要号召全体党员积极执行，并且要严肃的对待。而支部委员在此期间应认真检查与督促全体党员积极地为实现支部的决议而努力。
