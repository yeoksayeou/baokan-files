    Deepen the Technical Innovation Movement, Strive to Comprehensively Overfulfill the National Plan
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    (I)
    Under the constant care and correct leadership of the Party and the government, and thanks to the advanced technical guidance of Soviet experts, as well as the creativity and hard work of the broad masses of workers and staff, Anshan Iron and Steel (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) rapidly completed the tasks of enterprise democratic reform and production recovery.
    In the early stages of production recovery, Ansteel still had many backward and unreasonable phenomena left over from colonial industry: such as backward technology, a large proportion of manual operations, a lack of scientific management organization and planning methods, uneven production, great impulsiveness, poor product quality, high costs, and poor safety and labor protection conditions. In order to change these unreasonable phenomena, Ansteel has strengthened its planning management by implementing operational plans as the center, and promoted the responsibility system by establishing a production area management system as the center, following the experience of Soviet enterprise management in recent years. Through these efforts, the company's appearance has been fundamentally changed, and the level of enterprise management has been improved.
    With the development of national economic construction, Ansteel, while restoring production, began formal exploration and design, and carried out the construction of key capital construction projects.
    According to the national industrialization policy, Ansteel must complete its historical mission in two aspects: one is the capital construction work invested by the state, which requires the establishment of new factories and the reconstruction of old factories with the most economically sound design, at high speed, and with modern technology; the other is the production work of existing factories and mines, which must continuously transform existing equipment with the minimum amount of capital, so that it can play the greatest role in production, that is to say, to continuously tap potential, increase labor productivity, in order to accumulate funds for expanded reproduction, and improve the cultural and welfare living standards of workers and staff.
    In order to complete the above two tasks, we are required to master new technologies as quickly as possible. Carrying out a mass technical innovation movement is an important part of mastering new technologies.
    Ansteel is a metallurgical complex and is also engaged in capital construction engineering. Therefore, the content of technical innovation is quite extensive and diverse. This fact demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the transformation of the working class's attitude towards labor and the upsurge of production enthusiasm under the new social system. In general, there are roughly five sources of technical innovation: first, suggestions from Soviet experts and new foreign technologies; second, rationalization proposals from the masses of workers, technicians, and managers; third, advanced working methods of workers and technicians; fourth, advanced experience from fraternal factories and mines in China; and fifth, experimental results of scientific research from within the factory and from scientific research institutions. These five components are often interconnected and cannot be mechanically divided or isolated. Due to the different conditions in each department, their progress and effectiveness vary. According to very incomplete statistics: since the restoration of production, Soviet experts have made a total of 2,079 suggestions in production, 5,563 in capital construction, and 2,645 in design; the broad masses of workers and staff have made more than 40,000 rationalization proposals in production and capital construction; in 1953, a total of 275 advanced experiences emerged in production, and 46 key advanced experiences were initially promoted, and more than 230 advanced experiences emerged in capital construction, of which more than 50 were major. In 1953, a total of 36 production technology research and experimental projects were carried out.
    The technical innovation movement has shown tremendous driving force, gradually changing the face of Ansteel.
    The ideology and understanding of the broad masses of workers and staff have been greatly improved in the movement. The broad masses of workers have recognized their own wisdom and creative power from practice, promoting the emergence of rationalization proposals and advanced experiences. Workers, technicians, and managers have recognized the superiority of Soviet advanced experience, and have launched a wave of learning from the Soviet Union.
    In the movement, a group of advanced workers, excellent engineering and technical personnel, and managers who are closely connected with the masses have emerged. Through long-term work and research, they have not only improved their ideological awareness, but also their technical level, and have gradually mastered new technologies, thus becoming the backbone of production and construction.
    In the movement, potential has been continuously tapped, old technical and economic norms have been broken through, and norms have been continuously revised and improved. For example, the highest utilization coefficient of open hearth furnace bottom area during the puppet Manchuria period was 3.83, while our annual average utilization coefficient in 1953 reached 5.17. The improvement of all technical and economic norms is centrally reflected in the rising labor productivity of the entire company over the years. For example, labor productivity in 1950 increased by 77 percent compared with 1949. In 1951, it increased by 28 percent compared with 1950. In 1952, it increased by 33 percent compared with 1951. In 1953, it increased by 24 percent compared with 1952. Over the past few years, Ansteel has completed the national plan. This has ensured that various welfare facilities can be carried out on the basis of developing production, increasing the wage income of workers and staff, thereby gradually improving the cultural and material life of workers and staff.
    In the movement, although the old imbalances were overcome, new imbalances were also generated. In order to solve the new imbalances, a series of continuous improvements in technical equipment, operation, labor organization, and management systems (such as operating procedures, raw material supply, wages) were correspondingly promoted.
    Under what conditions was the technical innovation movement launched? Why did it become possible?
    First of all, the policies of the Party and the government pointed out the direction for us. The Party and the government pointed out that technical reform of the production process is an important means of improving labor productivity. Our practice has proved the great significance of this instruction, and we have realized that actively transforming old equipment, old technologies, old tools, and changing backward operating methods are important ways to promote the development of the national economy. The Party and the government are constantly concerned about improving the working conditions of enterprises, and about the health and safety of workers, pointing out that the mechanization of the production process is the fundamental way to eliminate heavy operations, eliminate tense physical labor, improve working conditions, and ensure personal safety. Our practice has also proved this point, enabling us to deeply realize that the mechanization of the production process can improve production culture, prevent occupational diseases, and improve working conditions, thus also being able to most effectively ensure the health and safety of workers. The Party and the government are constantly concerned about improving the technical level of the working class, pointing out that the development of the national economy is inseparable from the improvement of the technical level of the working class, and is inseparable from the mechanization and automation of the production process, which is the technical basis for eliminating the opposition between mental and physical labor. The experience of our practice has also proved this point. Often a major technical reform, invention and creation, or advanced experience must go through repeated research, discussion, collection of reference materials, and several trials and failures before it can succeed. The process of research and long-term experimentation improves the technical level of the technical innovators themselves. After successful creation, in order to use new equipment, it promotes more workers to learn and master new technologies.
    Secondly, the reason why the movement could be carried out is because the working class is already a liberated class, is the leading class of the country, and the broad masses of workers and technicians have demonstrated their intelligence and great power in their labor. Over the past few years, the broad masses of workers and staff have improved their awareness under the education of the Party, and have personally experienced the consistency between national economic development and individual interests, thereby increasing their creative enthusiasm for seeking innovative ways. It is precisely because the working class has become the master of the factory that workers are able to use their own hands and their own efforts to transform their working environment and liberate themselves from heavy labor and harsh working conditions. This is the driving force for the broad masses of workers and staff to actively participate in the movement. In the movement, many suggestions were made by veteran workers, who were oppressed and exploited during the puppet Manchuria period and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, their lives were not guaranteed, and they were threatened by unemployment. The reactionary ruling class never thought about how to improve the working conditions of workers, so they had no possibility of showing their wisdom, nor did they have any creation. Only after the reactionary rule was overthrown, workers are no longer exploited, their lives are improved, and their spirits are happy, then it is possible and there is great interest in researching, and a large number of extensive innovation deeds and creative suggestions appear. Only in socialist enterprises, the cooperation between workers and technicians based on common interests, creative labor, can there be extensive development possibilities. This cooperation enables workers and technicians to improve their technical level, enrich their knowledge, and promote the development of the technical innovation movement.
    Again, learning from the Soviet Union is an indispensable factor for the movement to achieve results. As Chairman Mao instructed us, "We must learn from the Soviet Union, we must carry out great national construction, we are faced with arduous tasks, and our experience is not enough. Therefore, we must conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience." The technical guidance of Soviet experts played a decisive role in the entire movement. Many technical difficulties encountered in creation were enthusiastically helped by experts, and some were successfully tested by referring to Soviet books.
        (II)
    From the practice of launching the masses to carry out the technical innovation movement, we have gained the following experiences and lessons.
    First, the technical innovation movement is carried out in the continuous struggle against bureaucracy, conservative thinking, and outdated technical viewpoints. In the past, in our enterprises, many rationalization proposals were unreasonably shelved and accumulated, the summary and promotion of certain advanced experiences were not the responsibility of anyone, and many people also believed that the potential had been exhausted. Among a few engineering and technical personnel, there were erroneous ideas such as "it is impossible to exceed the puppet Manchuria standard," "the British and Americans in the past did not have it, it is simply a fantasy," and "it is impossible to improve production unless new equipment is replaced." Whether it is a rationalization proposal, advanced experience, or even a suggestion from a Soviet expert, they are often opposed by old habits as soon as they appear. Some are put in drawers, some are hit when they temporarily fail in the middle, and some are suspected. Therefore, the task of leading cadres is first to have a keen sense of these new things, to see that they are new in the myriad of affairs, that they are major events in production and construction, and to firmly grasp them, carefully study their role and the possibility of promotion. Timely spiritual and material encouragement and assistance should be given, and the masses should be educated to criticize those erroneous ideas, establish correct understanding, actively support them, and promote their growth, so that it can develop into a huge driving force for improving production and accelerating construction.
    Second, the technical innovation movement is based on strengthening planning management and implementing the responsibility system, gradually incorporating mass creation into the daily activities of enterprise management, and developing towards the goal of planned overcoming of weak links and striving to overfulfill the national plan. The working class's creative enthusiasm and high patriotic spirit are very valuable, and the masses must be mobilized to create and make suggestions from all aspects, including aspects not discovered by the leadership, but the leading comrades of the enterprise must be good at guiding the masses' creative enthusiasm to solve the key problems in production. With the increasing scale of production and construction, the increasing number of new products, and the increasingly strict requirements for quality, the implementation of the operation plan requires the balanced and comprehensive completion of the national plan. The adoption of new technologies, whether from Soviet expert suggestions, rationalization proposals from workers and staff, advanced experience, or scientific research and experimental work, is becoming more and more obvious and necessary for improving equipment and tools, improving labor organization, increasing output, and reducing costs. Therefore, how to make technical innovation work an activity that enterprise leaders are concerned about on a daily basis has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this regard, Ansteel has adopted the following measures through the central tasks of promoting Soviet advanced experience, improving labor organization, strengthening planning management, and implementing the responsibility system:
    First, it is clearly stipulated in the job responsibility regulations that administrative responsible cadres at all levels must include the implementation of expert suggestions, the promotion of advanced experience, and the organization of rationalization proposals from workers and staff as one of their natural responsibilities.
    Second, establish functional institutions for managing rationalization proposals. Establish rationalization proposal institutions within the technical departments, and set up full-time or part-time personnel in the technical sections of workshops and construction sites to manage the daily work of reviewing, identifying, organizing experiments, and rewarding rationalization proposals, and some also manage the daily registration, statistics, and summary of expert suggestions. Establish advanced experience promotion sections (groups) in the labor and wage departments to manage daily summary, promotion, and rewards. Draw experienced engineers with theoretical foundations from various departments, establish metallurgical research laboratories in the technical departments, and sign research contracts with the Academy of Sciences and universities. Select outstanding engineering and technical personnel to follow experts to work and study on a regular basis.
    Third, formulate plans for inviting experts to solve problems, plans for promoting advanced experience, and plans for new technologies and research experiments on a regular basis. And formulated the expert suggestion management method, rationalization proposal work regulations, advanced experience promotion work regulations and other relevant systems.
    Fourth, clarify key problems and announce rationalization proposal topics to workers and staff. After the implementation of the operation plan, there are sufficient conditions to correctly raise problems, because checking the implementation of the operation plan, and from the analysis of economic activities, advanced links and backward factors can be discovered in a timely and specific manner. Compile the key points into easy-to-understand topics, and rely on the trade union to publish the topics in the form of publicity.
    Third, while correcting thinking, clarifying purpose, and strengthening organization, it is also necessary to take measures to solve a series of problems such as raw material supply, construction and experiments, wage rewards, and staffing, so that the technical innovation movement can develop. At the beginning of the movement, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff was very high. There were many suggestions and a lot of advanced experience. However, there are still many problems that must be solved in a timely and correct manner from the time a suggestion is made to the time it is actually and frequently adopted in production and construction. Experience has proved that only when the suggestions of workers and staff are successful and realized, and they regularly participate in production and construction, can we ensure that the enthusiasm of the masses continues to rise. Only in this way is our purpose. Actively supporting the adoption of new technologies requires administrative leaders to create some necessary material conditions. Ansteel has taken the following measures:
    First, if the technical improvement proposed by a worker is initially studied and confirmed to be valuable, the time for appropriate special trial production shall be approved, and the wages during this period shall not be lower than the average of the actual wages earned in the previous three months.
    Second, a technical improvement that has been initially successfully tested can be tried out after review and approval. In order to avoid the reduction of output during the trial period from affecting the piece-rate income of workers, it is stipulated that during the approved trial period, the wage income of operators shall not be lower than the average of the actual wages earned in the previous three months.
    Third, the raw materials and tools required for trial production or experiments must be issued as much as possible, and should not be withheld simply because they were not planned in the past.
    Fourth, if manufacturing is required, construction and manufacturing forces should be arranged as much as possible. Many transformations can be included in the maintenance operation plan.
    Fifth, for all those that prove to be effective after adoption, rewards must be given in a timely and correct manner in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Heavy Industry.
    Sixth, after a technical improvement is successful, workers must be actively organized to learn and train them to master new operating methods.
    Seventh, the staff reduced due to the improvement cannot be dismissed, but should be properly resettled, organized to study, and helped to master new technologies and transferred to new jobs.
    Fourth, the technical innovation movement was smoothly carried out under the correct guidance of learning from the Soviet Union, implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and constantly accepting advanced technology, and avoiding errors and deviations. The vast majority of Ansteel's major technical innovations were successfully implemented by accepting the suggestions of Soviet experts and through the efforts of workers and staff. As for the technical innovation projects that were inspired by experts and referred to Soviet books, it is even more difficult to count for a while. More significant examples include: support beam replacement, and quick overhaul of blast furnaces. There are also many technical innovators such as: Zhang Mingshan, Liu Zuwei, and Wu Liangya, who encountered many difficulties in the process of creation, and were able to achieve final success only after constantly receiving personal guidance from Soviet experts or referring to Soviet books for inspiration. Now, when the broad masses of workers and staff, especially engineering and technical personnel, encounter difficulties and cannot move forward, they often ask experts for advice, which has become a more common conscious action. Experience has proved that it is often difficult to succeed in isolating "creation" behind closed doors.
    Fifth, the technical innovation work must advocate the spirit of collectivist creation, advocate the cooperation of engineering and technical personnel and workers, and the coordination of various aspects, and constantly expand and consolidate the advanced role, from individual to collective, from point to surface to strive to achieve universal improvement in order to form a movement. The technical innovation movement cannot be realized by relying only on individual advanced workers or a single process, a department, or a shift. For example, veteran workers and technicians must complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and combine work experience with technical theory. For example, it is not possible to adopt new technologies in a major process (such as open hearth furnace, blast furnace, rolling mill) to reach the advanced level, but the auxiliary processes (such as ingot casting, blower, heating furnace, shearing) do not keep up. For example, the transformation of production equipment is difficult to achieve without the cooperation of the maintenance department. Some advanced experiences are promoted in a single shift in the continuous production department (such as blast furnace), some are simply impossible, and some will not be consolidated. Therefore, we must advocate mutual assistance and mutual learning between workers and technicians, cooperation between production and maintenance departments, and close coordination of various processes. To this end, we must vigorously carry out publicity and education work, not only to create an atmosphere of technical innovation, but also to carry out regular political and technical education in various forms, so that more workers and more units can join the movement. In order to launch a climax of technical innovation, promote experience and consolidate achievements, Ansteel has done this:
    First, organize rationalization proposal groups or skill groups among the masses.
    Second, the Party committee, the administration, and the trade union jointly hold a conference to reward and mobilize.
    Third, the trade union and the Communist Youth League hold a representative conference of technical personnel to reward those technical personnel who have achieved success in conscientiously implementing expert suggestions and cooperating with workers.
    Fourth, hold actual performances of advanced experience and organize visits and discussions.
    Fifth, hold exhibitions.
    Sixth, convene a technical representative conference (also known as a technical organizational measures representative conference).
    Seventh, vigorously carry out technical education work: open short-term training courses, such as drawing workers and foremen to study basic technical theory, and running advanced producer schools. Invite Soviet experts to give lectures to technical personnel, and advocate learning Russian. Open long-term regular vocational spare-time schools, such as: spare-time middle schools, spare-time senior vocational schools, and spare-time universities to absorb the participation of the broad masses of workers, technicians, and managers. In the winter training class for capital construction workers, focus on learning expert suggestions, advanced experience, and construction operation procedures.
    Eighth, according to the suggestions of experts, advanced experience and the results of research and experiments, appropriately revise the operating procedures. Some are included in the production technology organization measures plan, construction organization design and operation plan, and become factory rules and regulations for workers and staff to follow.
    Ninth, publish compilations of rationalization proposals, compilations of advanced experience, and lecture notes of experts.
        (III)
    Ansteel's technical innovation work is still very limited, and the phenomenon of technical backwardness is still quite serious. We have not learned enough from many advanced experiences of fraternal factories and mines in China, and we have not implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts well enough. We have not done all the work of carrying out technical innovation, and there are many shortcomings, such as the proportion of workers who make rationalization proposals is not large, some units have not set up the necessary institutions or full-time personnel, and many rationalization proposals have not solved the construction problems, so they have not been realized. Not all leading cadres, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff fully recognize the profound significance of relying on the creative power of the working class and learning from the Soviet Union, such as some units have no one responsible for promoting advanced experience, and some masses are very enthusiastic, but the leadership still accumulates rationalization proposals. There is a lack of regular education for innovators, and the movement is not continuous and in-depth, especially the lack of systematic inspection and summary work. For example, some inventions and creations that have been awarded have not continued to be used in work, resulting in no effect being exerted. These shortcomings urgently need our efforts to overcome. We deeply know that the technical innovation movement is only a beginning at present, and it will always be our long-term task in the future. We must make technical improvements change with each passing day, and strive to accelerate the realization of national socialist industrialization under the light of the general line!

    深入开展技术革新运动，争取全面地超额完成国家计划
    鞍山钢铁公司
    （一）
    鞍钢在党和政府的经常关怀和正确领导下，由于苏联专家的先进技术指导，依靠了广大职工的创造和辛勤劳动，迅速地完成了企业民主改革和恢复生产的任务。
    在恢复生产的初期，鞍钢还存在着殖民地工业所遗留的许多落后而不合理的现象：如技术落后，手工操作比重大，缺乏科学的管理组织和计划方法，生产不均衡，突击性很大，产品质量差、成本高，安全与劳动保护条件恶劣等。为了改变这些不合理现象，几年来鞍钢按照苏联企业管理的经验，以实行作业计划为中心，加强了计划管理，并以建立生产区域管理制为中心推行了责任制。通过这些工作，基本上改变了企业的面貌，并使企业管理水平提高了一步。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，鞍钢在恢复生产的同时，开始了正式的勘察设计，进行了基本建设重点工程的施工。
    根据国家工业化的方针，鞍钢必须从两个方面完成自己的历史任务：一个是国家投资的基本建设工作，要求以最符合经济原则的设计，以高的速度和近代化的新技术来建立新的工厂并改建旧的工厂；一个是现有厂矿的生产工作，必须用最小限度的资金不断地改造现有设备，使它在生产中发挥最大作用，就是说要不断地挖掘潜力，提高劳动生产率，以积累扩大再生产的资金，改善职工文化福利生活水平。
    为了完成上述两方面的任务，就要求我们最迅速地掌握新的技术。开展群众性技术革新运动正是掌握新技术的重要环节。
    鞍钢是冶金联合工厂，同时还进行着基本建设工程施工。因之，技术革新的内容是相当广泛的，多种多样的。这一事实说明了在中国共产党领导下人民民主专政制度的优越性，和在新的社会制度下，工人阶级劳动态度的转变和生产积极性的高涨。总的来说，技术革新大体上有五个来源：第一是苏联专家建议和国外新技术；第二是工人、技术人员和管理人员群众性的合理化建议；第三是工人、技术人员的先进工作方法；第四是国内兄弟厂矿的先进经验；第五是工厂内部的和科学研究机关的科学研究的试验成果。这五个组成部分常常是互相有联系的，不能加以机械的分割或孤立起来。由于各部门的条件不同，因之它们的进展程度不同，成效也不同。根据极不完整的统计：鞍钢恢复生产以来苏联专家在生产方面共提出建议两千零七十九件，在基本建设方面共五千五百六十三件，在设计方面共两千六百四十五件；广大职工在生产与基本建设两方面共提出四万多件合理化建议；一九五三年，在生产方面共出现了二百七十五种先进经验，初步推广了四十六种关键性的先进经验，在基本建设方面共出现了二百三十多种先进经验，其中较大的有五十多件。一九五三年共进行了三十六项生产技术研究试验项目。
    技术革新运动显示了巨大的推动力量，使鞍钢的面貌逐步改变了。
    广大职工的思想和认识在运动中大大提高了。广大工人从实践中认识了自己的智慧和创造力量，促进了合理化建议与先进经验的出现。工人、技术人员和管理人员认识了苏联先进经验的优越性，掀起了学习苏联的热潮。
    在运动中涌现了一批和群众密切联系的先进工人，优秀的工程技术人员和管理人员。他们经过长期的工作与钻研，不仅提高了思想觉悟，也提高了技术水平，逐渐地掌握了新技术，因而他们成为生产和建设中的骨干。
    在运动中不断地挖掘潜力，突破了旧的技术经济定额，并不断地修正和提高了定额。如伪满时平炉炉底面积利用系数最高是三点八三，而我们一九五三年的年平均利用系数已达到五点一七。所有技术经济定额的提高，集中反映在全公司劳动生产率的历年高涨上。如一九五○年劳动生产率比一九四九年增涨了百分之七十七。一九五一年又比一九五○年增涨百分之二十八。一九五二年又比一九五一年增涨了百分之三十三。一九五三年又比一九五二年增涨了百分之二十四。数年来，鞍钢完成了国家计划。由此，保证了能够在发展生产的基础上进行各项福利设施，增加了职工的工资收入，从而逐步改善了职工的文化物质生活。
    在运动中虽然克服了旧的不平衡现象，但是同时又产生了新的不平衡。为了解决新的不平衡，就相应地促进了一系列的技术设备、操作、劳动组织以及管理制度（如操作规程、原材料供应、工资）的不断改善。
    技术革新运动是在什么条件下展开的呢？为什么成为可能呢？
    首先是党和政府的政策给我们指出了方向。党和政府指出生产过程的技术改革是提高劳动生产率的重要手段。在我们的实践中证明了这一指示的重大意义，认识了积极改造旧设备、旧技术、旧工具，改变落后的操作方法，是促进国民经济发展的重要途径。党和政府经常关心企业劳动条件的改善，关心工人的健康与安全，指出生产过程的机械化是消除笨重操作，消除紧张的体力劳动，改善劳动条件，保证人身安全的根本办法。在我们的实践中也证明了这一点，使我们深刻地认识到生产过程的机械化可以提高生产文化，防止职业病，改善劳动条件，因而也就可以最有效地保证工人的健康与安全。党和政府经常关怀工人阶级技术水平的提高，指出国家经济的发展是与工人阶级技术水平的提高分不开的，是与生产过程的机械化、自动化分不开的，这是消灭智力劳动与体力之对立的技术基础。我们实践的经验也证明了这一点。往往一件重大的技术改革，发明创造，先进经验都要经过反复的钻研、讨论、收集参考资料，经过若干次的试验，若干次的失败，才能成功的。在钻研和长时期的试验过程中就使技术革新者本身提高了技术水平。而在创造成功以后，为了要使用新设备，就推动更多的工人群众去学习和掌握新技术。
    其次，运动之所以能够开展，是因为工人阶级已经是解放了的阶级，是国家的领导阶级，广大的工人和技术人员在为自己的劳动中表现了聪明智慧和伟大力量。数年来，广大职工在党的教育下提高了觉悟，并亲身体验了国家经济发展与个人利益的一致性，因而提高了寻求革新途径的创造热情。也正是由于工人阶级已成为工厂的主人，使工人有可能用自己的手，经过自己的努力来改造自己的劳动环境，把自己从笨重的劳动和恶劣的劳动条件下解放出来。这就是广大职工积极参加运动的动力。在运动中许多建议都是老工人提出的，他们在伪满时期和国民党反动统治时期受压迫、受剥削、生活没有保障，受失业的威胁，反动统治阶级从来也不想如何去改善工人的劳动条件，因而他们没有可能表现他们的智慧，也没有什么创造。只有推翻了反动统治，工人不再受剥削，生活改善了，精神愉快了，才有可能也有极大的兴趣去钻研，大量的广泛的革新事迹与创造性的建议就出现了。也只有在社会主义企业里，建立在共同利益基础上的工人和技术人员的合作，创造性的劳动才有广泛发展的可能。这种合作使工人和技术人员提高了技术水平，丰富了知识，促进了技术革新运动的发展。
    再次，向苏联学习是运动获得成果不可缺少的因素。正如毛主席指示我们的“要学习苏联，我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们的面前是艰苦的，我们经验是不够的。因此，要认真学习苏联先进经验”。苏联专家的技术指导，在整个运动中起了决定性的作用。在创造中遇到许多技术上困难问题，都是专家热心帮助解决的，也有一些是参考了苏联书籍而试验成功的。
        （二）
    发动群众开展技术革新运动，从实践中我们得到了以下的经验教训。
    第一、技术革新运动是在不断地和官僚主义、保守思想、陈旧的技术观点进行斗争中开展起来的。过去在我们的企业中，有不少的合理化建议被无理地搁置和积压下来，某些先进经验的总结与推广无人负责，不少人也曾认为潜力已经挖光，在少数工程技术人员中曾存在着“无法超过伪满标准”、“过去英美都没有，简直是异想天开”以及
  “除非换上新设备无法提高生产”等错误思想。不论是合理化建议、先进经验、甚至苏联专家建议刚
  一出现时，往往遭受旧的习惯势力的反对。有的被放到抽屉里，有的在中途暂时失败的时候受到打击，有的被人怀疑。因之，领导干部的任务首先就是要对这些新鲜事物具有敏锐的感觉，在千头万绪的事务中看出来它们是新鲜的，是生产建设中的重大事件，并紧紧地抓住它们，细心地研究它们的作用和推广的可能性。及时给以精神上和物质上的鼓励和帮助，教育群众批判那些错误思想，树立正确认识，积极扶植，促其成长起来，那么它就可以发展成为提高生产，加速建设的巨大动力。
    第二、技术革新运动，是在加强了计划管理，推行责任制的基础上，将群众创造逐步地纳入了企业管理的日常活动，并引向有计划地克服薄弱环节，为超额完成国家计划而奋斗的目标下发展起来的。工人阶级的创造热情和高度的爱国主义精神是十分可贵的，必须发动群众从各方面，包括领导上所没有发现的方面去创造和提出建议，但企业的领导同志必须善于把群众创造热情引导去解决生产中的关键问题。随着生产建设规模日益扩大，产品新品种日益加多，质量日益要求严格，作业计划的实行，要求均衡地全面地完成国家计划。不论是苏联专家建议、职工的合理化建议、先进经验、科学研究试验工作等方面新技术的采用，对于改进设备和工具、改善劳动组织、提高产量、降低成本的作用也就愈加明显和必要。所以，如何使技术革新的工作成为企业领导干部日常关心的活动，就成为急待解决的问题了。对此，鞍钢曾通过推广苏联先进经验、改善劳动组织、加强计划管理和推行责任制等中心工作，采取了以下措施：
    一、在职责条例中明文规定，各级行政负责干部必须把贯彻专家建议、推广先进经验、组织职工合理化建议工作列为当然职责之一。
    二、设立管理合理化建议的职能机构。在技术部门内设立合理化建议机构，在车间、工地的技术科内设专职或兼职人员管理合理化建议的审核、鉴定、组织试验、奖励等日常工作，有的并兼管专家建议的日常登记、统计、总结等工作。在劳动工资部门内设立先进经验推广科（组），管理日常总结、推广、奖励等。从各部门抽调有理论基础并较有经验的工程师，在技术部门内成立冶金研究室并与科学研究院和高等学校订立研究合同。选派优秀的工程技术人员固定跟随专家工作学习。
    三、按期制订请专家解决的课题计划、推广先进经验工作计划及新技术与研究试验计划。并制订了专家建议管理办法、合理化建议工作条例、先进经验推广工作条例等有关制度。
    四、明确关键问题，向职工宣布合理化建议课题。在实行作业计划以后，便有了充分条件来正确地提出问题，因为检查作业计划执行情况，从经济活动分析中就可以及时地、具体地发现先进环节和落后因素。将关键所在编成通俗易懂的课题，依靠工会将课题以宣传形式公布。
    第三、在端正思想、明确目的性、加强组织的同时，还必须采取措施解决原材料供应、施工和试验、工资奖励以及定员等一系列的问题，技术革新运动才能发展起来。运动刚一开始时，广大职工热情是很高的。建议很多，先进经验也很多。但从提出建议到真正经常采用到生产建设中去，还有很多问题必须及时正确地加以解决。经验证明，只有当职工的建议成功了实现了，经常参加了生产建设，才能保证群众的热情不断高涨。也只有这样才是我们的目的。积极扶植新技术的采用，在行政领导来说就必须创造一些必要的物质条件。在鞍钢曾采取了以下措施：
      一、职工所提技术改进，经初步研究确有价值者，批准适当专门试制的时间，这期间的工资应不低于本人前三个月实得工资的平均数。
    二、初步试验成功的技术改进，经过审查批准，可试用。为了避免因试用期间产量降低，影响工人的计件收入，规定了在批准的试用期间，操作人员的工资收入不得低于前三个月实得工资平均数。
    三、试制或试验所需原材料、工具，必需者应尽量发给，不要因为过去没计划就一定不发给。
    四、需要制造者，应尽最大可能安排施工制造力量。许多改造可列在检修作业计划里。
    五、凡采用后证明有效的，一定按重工业部规定，及时地、正确地奖励。
    六、一项技术改进成功后，须积极组织工人学习，训练他们掌握新的操作方法。
    七、由于改进而缩减的定员，不能解雇，应妥善安置，组织他们学习，帮助他们掌握新技术转到新工作岗位上去。
    第四、技术革新运动是在学习苏联，贯彻了苏联专家建议，不断地接受了先进技术的正确指导，避免了错误与偏差的情况下，顺利地开展起来的。鞍钢绝大部分重大的技术革新都是接受苏联专家建议，经过职工努力贯彻而成功的。至于得到专家的启示，参考苏联书籍因而出现的技术革新项目一时更难以统计。较显著的例子如：托梁换基、高炉快速大检修。还有不少的技术革新者如：张明山、刘祖威、吴良亚在创造的过程中，遇到不少的疑难，都是不断地得到苏联专家的亲自指导或参照了苏联书籍得到启示而获得最后成功的。而今广大职工特别是工程技术人员在遇到困难不能前进时，往往去请教专家，这已成较普遍的自觉行动。经验证明：关起门来孤立“创造”常是难以成功的。
    第五、技术革新工作必须提倡集体主义创造精神，提倡工程技术人员与工人合作，各方面协作配合，不断地扩大与巩固先进作用，由个人到集体，由点到面争取达到普遍提高才能形成运动。技术革新运动不是只靠个别的先进工人或单独的一个工序、一个部门、一个班次所能够实现的。比如老工人和技术人员须互补短长，把劳动经验与技术理论结合起来。比如一个主要工序（如平炉、高炉、轧钢机）采用新技术达到先进，而辅助工序（如铸锭、鼓风机、加热炉、剪断）没有跟上去就不行。比如生产设备的改造没有检修部门配合就难实现。某些先进经验在连续生产的部门（如高炉）在一个班次内推行，有的根本不可能，有的不会巩固。因此就必须提倡工人与技术人员互助互学，生产与检修部门合作，各工序严密配合。为此就要大力开展宣传教育工作，不仅要造成技术革新的空气，同时要通过各种形式进行经常的政治、技术教育，使更多的职工，更多的单位投入运动中来。在鞍钢为了掀起技术革新的高潮，推广经验巩固成果，曾是这样做的：
    一、在群众中组织合理化建议小组或窍门小组。
    二、党委、行政、工会联合召开大会奖励和动员。
    三、工会、青年团召开技术人员代表大会，奖励那些认真贯彻专家建议与工人合作有成绩的技术人员。
    四、举办先进经验实际表演和组织参观座谈。
    五、举办展览会。
    六、召开技术代表大会（又称技术组织措施代表大会）。
    七、大力开展技术教育工作：开办短期训练班，如抽调工人和工长学习基础的技术理论，办先进生产者学校。聘请苏联专家给技术人员讲课，并提倡学习俄文。开办长期的经常性的职工业余学校，如：业余中学、业余高级职业学校、业余大学吸收广大工人、技术人员和管理人员参加。在基本建设工人冬训班中，着重学习专家建议、先进经验和施工操作规程。
    八、根据专家建议，先进经验和研究试验的结果，适当地修改操作规程。有些是列入生产技术组织措施计划、施工组织设计和作业计划中，变为厂规厂法以便职工遵行。
    九、刊印合理化建议汇编、先进经验汇编、专家讲课讲义。
        （三）
    鞍钢的技术革新工作还是很有限的，技术落后现象仍相当严重，国内兄弟厂矿许多先进经验我们学习的很不够，苏联专家建议贯彻还不够好。开展技术革新的工作我们并没有全部做好，缺点很多，如提合理化建议职工数占全体职工比例数不大，有些单位尚未设立应有的机构或专职人员，有不少的合理化建议没有解决施工问题，故未实现。还不是所有领导干部、工人、工程技术人员、职员都充分认识到依靠工人阶级创造力量与学习苏联的深刻意义，如有些单位推广先进经验无人负责，也有的群众热情很高，但领导上仍积压合理化建议。对于革新者缺乏经常教育，运动还不是持续的和深入的，特别是缺乏系统的检查与总结工作。如有些曾经受奖的发明创造在工作中没有继续采用，结果没发挥效果，这些缺点急待我们努力克服。我们深知技术革新运动目前仅是个开端，今后将一直是我们的长期任务。我们必须使技术日新月异的改进，在总路线的照耀下，为加速实现国家社会主义工业化而奋斗！
