Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 1st: The 17th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) opened on March 30th at the United Nations Headquarters.

At the beginning of the meeting, Soviet representative Mr. Tsarapkin drew the Council's attention to the abnormal phenomenon that the People's Republic of China was still not represented in the United Nations and ECOSOC. Tsarapkin pointed out that the Kuomintang elements illegally attending the meeting could neither represent China in ECOSOC as a member nor in any other UN agency, because only the representatives sent by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China are the only legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China.

The Czechoslovak representative, Mr. Nosek, supported the Soviet representative's opinion.

Subsequently, the meeting elected the President and two Vice-Presidents of the Council. Mr. Cooke (Argentina) was unanimously elected as President, and Mr. Nosek (Czechoslovakia) and Mr. Kertland (Australia) as Vice-Presidents. President Cooke called on the representatives of all countries on the Council to promote cooperation between the peoples of all countries and to establish normal relations between countries regardless of their social systems.

In the afternoon session, the draft agenda including more than twenty issues was discussed. Soviet representative Tsarapkin suggested that ECOSOC include in the agenda the issue of measures to eliminate barriers to international trade and develop international economic relations, as proposed by the Soviet delegation. He also suggested that, due to the importance and urgency of this issue, it should be given priority in the discussions at the meeting.

The Czechoslovak representative supported the Soviet representative's suggestion, pointing out that if the issue proposed by the Soviet Union could be satisfactorily resolved, it would consolidate and expand world trade relations, thereby contributing to the consolidation of international security and the easing of international tensions.

The British representative who spoke next stated that he believed that the issue of measures to eliminate barriers to international trade and develop international economic relations was very important and must be carefully studied. However, the British delegation opposed discussing the issue raised by the Soviet delegation at this session of ECOSOC. The British representative suggested moving the issue raised by the Soviet delegation to the 18th session of ECOSOC to be held in the summer of 1954. The representatives of the United States, Venezuela, and Australia supported the British suggestion.

The Soviet representative then spoke, pointing out that there was no reason to delay the discussion of the above issues. Since all the representatives who spoke agreed that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation was very important, what reason could there be to delay the discussion of this issue? There is no such reason, and there cannot be one. Merchants and politicians in many countries are currently advocating the expansion of international trade. The United Nations Charter requires the United Nations and its agencies—ECOSOC—to assist in expanding international economic relations.

The meeting voted on the British delegation's suggestion. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and India voted against it. The delegations of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Pakistan, and thirteen other countries voted in favor of the suggestion. The representatives of Egypt and Yugoslavia abstained.

The Argentine representative explained the reasons for his vote, saying that although his delegation voted in favor of the British suggestion, he also recognized the importance of the issue raised by the Soviet representative. He advocated that the United Nations Secretariat "study" the issue of barriers in international trade and submit a report to the next session of ECOSOC as a basis for discussing the Soviet suggestion.

    联合国经济与社会理事会第十七届会议开会
    苏联代表主张讨论消除国际贸易障碍问题
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国经济与社会理事会第十七届会议三月三十日在联合国大厦开幕。
    在会议开始时，苏联代表查拉普金提请理事会注意这一不正常的现象，即：联合国及经社理事会中直到现在还没有中华人民共和国的代表。查拉普金指出，非法出席会议的国民党分子，既不能在经社理事会中以会员的身份代表中国，也不能在联合国其他任何机构中代表中国，因为只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府所派遣的代表才是中华人民共和国唯一合法的代表。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺西克支持苏联代表的意见。
    接着，会议选举理事会主席和两名副主席。大家一致选举库克（阿根廷）为主席，诺西克（捷克斯洛伐克）和柯特兰德（澳大利亚）为副主席。主席库克号召理事会的各国代表促进各国人民之间的合作，在各国之间不问社会制度如何建立正常的关系。
    在下午会议上，讨论了包括二十多个问题的议程草案。苏联代表查拉普金建议经社理事会在议程中列入苏联代表团提出的关于消除国际贸易的障碍和发展国际经济关系的措施的问题。他还建议，由于这个问题的重要和迫切，应在会上优先讨论。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表支持苏联代表的建议，他指出，如果能圆满解决苏联所提出的问题，就能使世界的贸易关系得以巩固和扩展，从而有利于巩固国际安全，缓和国际紧张局势。
    接着发言的英国代表表示，他认为关于消除国际贸易障碍及发展国际经济关系的措施的问题是很重要的，必须仔细研究。然而，英国代表团反对在这次经社理事会的会议上讨论苏联代表团提出的问题。英国代表建议将苏联代表团提出的这一问题移到将在一九五四年夏天举行的经社理事会第十八届会议上讨论。美国、委内瑞拉和澳大利亚代表支持英国的建议。
    苏联代表接着发言指出，没有任何理由拖延上述问题的讨论。既然，所有发言的代表都一致承认苏联代表团提出的问题是非常重要的，那么有什么理由来拖延讨论这一问题呢？这样的理由是没有而且不可能有的。许多国家的商人和政治家目前也都在主张扩大国际贸易。联合国宪章要求联合国和它的机构——经社理事会协助扩展国际经济关系。
    会议就英国代表团的建议进行了表决。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和印度代表投票反对。美国、英国、法国、比利时、巴基斯坦等十三国代表团赞成这个建议。埃及和南斯拉夫代表弃权。
    阿根廷代表解释投票的理由说，虽然他的代表团投票赞成英国的建议，但他也承认苏联代表提出的问题的重要性。他主张，联合国秘书处“研究”国际贸易中的障碍的问题，并向经社理事会下次会议提出报告，作为讨论苏联建议的基础。
