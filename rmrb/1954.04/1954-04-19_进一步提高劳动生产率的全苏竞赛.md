    All-Union Competition to Further Increase Labor Productivity
    By our correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    To greet May Day, Soviet workers are launching a large-scale socialist competition to further increase labor productivity with high political and labor enthusiasm.
    Increasing labor productivity has always been the main way for Soviet workers to increase production. Under the guidance of the Communist Party, and through their own experience, Soviet workers deeply understand that increasing labor productivity is the decisive condition for creating a prosperous economy and a happy life. Lenin pointed out in "A Great Beginning": "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and principal thing for the victory of the new social system." Stalin also said in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party: "If we do not systematically increase labor productivity in industry and agriculture, then we cannot solve the task of transformation, we will not only be unable to catch up with and overtake the advanced capitalist countries, but we will not even be able to maintain our own independent existence. Therefore, the question of increasing labor productivity is of paramount importance to us." Remembering the Party's instructions, Soviet workers are constantly working to increase labor productivity. In the twenty-five years since the industrialization of the country and the transformation of the national economy, labor productivity in industry has increased sixfold, and in the construction and railway transportation industries, it has increased three and a half times; the labor productivity of collective farms and state farms has also increased three times compared to pre-revolutionary agricultural labor.
    The higher the labor productivity, the lower the time, labor, and costs spent on each product, and the more social wealth and socialist funds are created and accumulated. The continuous development of Soviet industry is due to the planned development of the national economy, the expansion of socialist reproduction, and the continuous increase in labor productivity. Every 1% increase in labor productivity in Soviet industry results in an additional output of products worth hundreds of millions of rubles for the country. During the First Five-Year Plan, every 1% increase was equivalent to an increase of 190 million rubles of products; during the Second Five-Year Plan, every 1% increase was equivalent to an increase of 433.3 million rubles of products; during the Third Five-Year Plan, every 1% increase was equivalent to an increase of 940 million rubles of products; during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, every 1% increase was equivalent to an increase of 1.385 billion rubles of products; during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, when Soviet heavy and light industries are developing on an unprecedented scale, the significance of increasing labor productivity for increasing production is even greater. The labor productivity of Soviet industry increased by 10% in 1951 compared to 1950, 7% in 1952 compared to 1951, and 6% in 1953 compared to 1952.
    The potential for increasing labor productivity is infinite. The labor productivity increased by many advanced enterprises in the Soviet Union exceeds that of general enterprises. And the labor productivity of advanced enterprises themselves can also be greatly improved. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to further greatly increase labor productivity. Comrade Malenkov recently issued a call in his speech to voters: "The concern for vigorously increasing labor productivity must truly become the center of all practical leadership work in further developing the national economy. A truly broad national movement must be launched to strive for greatly increasing labor productivity..." The competition to further increase labor productivity initiated by twenty-eight enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow region is precisely a response to the Party's call.
    The initiators of the competition are all well-known enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow region, including factories manufacturing automobiles, locomotives, bearings, lathes, machines, agricultural machines, textile factories, chemical factories, building materials factories, coal mines, construction companies, railway bureaus, and power plants.
    For example: The Stalin Automobile Manufacturing Plant—this factory has increased its production by 30% and its labor productivity by 20% in the past three years without adding new plants and equipment, and more than 60% of the workers have completed their Five-Year Plan quotas ahead of schedule. Now, all the workers of the factory guarantee that they will increase labor productivity by 7% this year compared to last year. This will be achieved by tapping the wisdom of the masses, improving the technical level of the workers, and improving technical equipment. No less than 1,500 production improvement methods and workers' rationalization proposals will be adopted this year; 6,000 workers, 500 foremen, and 700 engineering and technical personnel will improve their skills; high-efficiency new lathes will be installed in various workshops, which can perform six to eight operations simultaneously, and the basic production process will be fully mechanized.
    Kaganovich First Bearing Manufacturing Plant—this factory's output in 1953, calculated per machine and per square meter of plant, increased by half compared to 1950, and more than doubled compared to pre-war levels; its labor productivity increased by almost one and a half times compared to pre-war levels. Based on the initiative of young female workers Drozhina and Ofcharova, the factory has launched a competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in terms of increasing labor productivity. More than 1,500 workers actively participating in this competition have completed their Five-Year Plan quotas. Now, all the workers of the factory guarantee that they will increase labor productivity by 6.4% this year compared to last year, and complete the Five-Year Plan in terms of increasing labor productivity in four and a half years. They will achieve this goal by adopting high-speed processing methods, promoting the experience of advanced producers, and strengthening the mechanization and automation of production. No less than 5,000 people throughout the factory will participate in various technical studies.
    In addition, all the employees of the Stalin Mountain Coal Mine Trust of the Moscow Coal Mining Company will improve production organization, adopt advanced technical procedures, and better use equipment to ensure that labor productivity will be increased by 7% this year compared to last year, thereby increasing the daily coal output and overproducing 10,000 tons of coal. All the employees of the Moscow section of the Moscow-Kursk-Donbas railway line will carry out a competition for heavy and full loads to ensure that 1,200 extra carriages and 1 million tons of goods will be transported this year. All the employees of the Moscow Residential Construction Company will promote the flowing high-speed construction method, improve the level of mechanization in construction, and adopt advanced technical procedures to ensure that labor productivity will be increased by 11% this year and the planned construction cost will be reduced by 7%.
    These twenty-eight enterprises that initiated the competition, in Moscow alone, will overproduce 151.14 million rubles in 1954, including several hundred extra trucks, 1,500 various electric machines, 20,000 watches, 1,251,000 meters of wool and silk, etc.
    This initiative of Moscow workers to strive to further increase labor productivity, thereby increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs, has immediately received a warm response from workers in all industries throughout the Soviet Union. Twenty-five enterprises in Leningrad, machine-building workers in Kyiv, Minsk, and Yerevan, tractor-building workers in Stalingrad and Kharkiv, metallurgical workers in Ukraine, coal mining workers in Donbas, Karaganda, and the Urals, oil workers in Baku and Bashkir, timber harvesting workers in Karelia-Finland, textile workers in Tashkent and Vilnius, railway workers in Irkutsk, Brest, and Tbilisi, port workers in Riga, tractor drivers in Zhinkylev Oblast, collective farm members in Almaty Oblast... have all joined the massive wave of competition to increase labor productivity. This competition is developing on a scale of a national movement.
    Soviet workers possess powerful technical equipment, well-organized production, and a high level of technical expertise. Relying on a humble spirit that is never complacent and selfless labor, they will surely achieve greater victories in further increasing labor productivity and completing the tasks of the Five-Year Plan.

    进一步提高劳动生产率的全苏竞赛
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    为了迎接五一节，苏联劳动者以高度的政治和劳动热情，展开了进一步提高劳动生产率的大规模的社会主义竞赛。
    提高劳动生产率，向来是苏联劳动者增加生产的主要途径。苏联劳动者在共产党的教导下，在自身的体验中，深切地了解到，提高劳动生产率是创造繁荣的经济和幸福的生活的决定性条件。列宁在“伟大的创举”中指出过：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”斯大林在联共第十六次代表大会的报告中也说过：“倘若不在工农业中有系统的提高劳动生产率，那末，我们就不能解决改造的任务，我们就不但不能够赶上和赶过资本主义先进的国家，而且甚至于不能保持自己的独立存在。因此，提高劳动生产率的问题对于我们有头等意义。”记取着党的指示，苏联劳动者时刻不放松地努力提高劳动生产率，在国家工业化和国民经济改造以来的二十五年中，在工业方面劳动生产率已提高为六倍，在建筑业和铁路运输业方面提高为三倍半；集体农庄和国营农场的劳动生产率也提高为革命前农业劳动的三倍。
    劳动生产率越高，在每个产品上所花的时间、劳动量和费用就越低，所创造的社会财富和积累的社会主义资金就越多。苏联工业的不断发展，是由于有计划地发展国民经济，扩大社会主义再生产，和不断提高劳动生产率而来的。苏联工业中劳动生产率提高每百分之一，就为国家额外增产价值数以万万卢布计的产品。在第一个五年计划期间，提高每百分之一就等于增产一亿九千万卢布产品；在第二个五年计划期间，提高每百分之一等于增产四亿三千三百万卢布产品；在第三个五年计划期间，提高每百分之一等于增产九亿四千万卢布产品；在第四个五年计划期间，提高每百分之一等于增产十三亿八千五百万卢布产品；在第五个五年计划期间，当苏联重工业和轻工业都以空前规模发展的时候，提高劳动生产率对于增产的意义是更大了。苏联工业的劳动生产率，在一九五一年比一九五○年提高百分之十，一九五二年比一九五一年提高百分之七，一九五三年比一九五二年提高百分之六。
    提高劳动生产率的潜在力是无穷的。苏联许多先进企业所提高的劳动生产率超过了一般企业。而先进企业本身劳动生产率也还可以大大提高。所以进一步地大大提高劳动生产率是可能的和必要的。马林科夫同志最近在对选民的演说中发出了号召：“要使对大力提高劳动生产率的关怀真正成为进一步发展国民经济的一切实际领导工作的中心。必须展开一个真正广泛的全民运动，以争取大大提高劳动生产率……。”由莫斯科市和莫斯科州二十八个企业发起的进一步提高劳动生产率的竞赛，正是响应党的这个号召而产生的。
    竞赛的发起者都是莫斯科市和莫斯科州的有名企业，包括汽车、机车、轴承、车床、机器、农业机器等制造厂、纺织工厂、化学工厂、建筑材料工厂、煤矿、建筑公司、铁路局、电力厂。
    例如：斯大林汽车制造厂——这个工厂三年来没有添置产场和设备而增产了百分之三十的产品，提高了百分之二十的劳动生产率，百分之六十以上工人提前完成了五年计划的定额。现在全厂职工保证，今年将比去年提高劳动生产率百分之七。这将依靠发挥群众的智慧，提高职工的技术水平，改进技术装备来取得。今年将采用不下一千五百个改进生产的办法和工人的合理化建议；将有六千名工人、五百名工长和七百名工程技术人员提高他们的熟练程度；在各个车间将装置高效率的新车床，它们可以同时进行六个到八个操作，基本的生产过程将完全机械化。
    卡冈诺维奇第一轴承制造厂——这个工厂一九五三年的产量，以每台机器和每平方公尺产场计算，比一九五○年增加了半倍，比战前增加了一倍多；它的劳动生产率比战前提高了差不多一倍半。根据青年女工德罗志娜和奥甫察罗娃的倡议，工厂已经展开在提高劳动生产率方面提前完成五年计划的竞赛。积极参加这个竞赛的一千五百多工人已经完成五年计划的定额。现在全厂职工保证，今年将比去年提高劳动生产率百分之六点四，在四年半中在提高劳动生产率方面完成五年计划。他们将以采用高速加工法，推广先进生产者的经验，加强生产的机械化和自动化，来实现这个目标。全厂将有不下五千人参加各种技术学习。
    此外，莫斯科采煤公司斯大林山煤矿托拉斯全体职工，以改进生产组织，采用先进技术程序，更好使用设备，保证今年比去年提高劳动生产率百分之七，从而将增加每昼夜的采煤量和超额增产一万吨煤。莫斯科—库尔斯克—顿巴斯铁路线的莫斯科段全体职工，以开展重载满载的竞赛运动来保证今年超额运载一千二百个车厢和一百万吨的货物。莫斯科住宅建筑公司全体职工，以推行流水高速建筑法，提高建筑的机械化水平，采用先进的技术程序，保证今年提高劳动生产率百分之十一，减低预定的建筑成本百分之七。
    这二十八个发起竞赛的企业中，仅莫斯科市的企业在一九五四年就将超额增产一亿五千一百四十万卢布，包括超额增产几百辆载重汽车、一千五百台各种电力机器、二万只表、一百二十五万一千公尺毛布和丝绸等等。
    莫斯科工人这种争取进一步提高劳动生产率，从而增加产量、改善质量和减低成本的创举，立刻得到全苏联各业劳动者的热烈响应。列宁格勒市的二十五个企业、基辅、明斯克和埃里温的机器制造工人，斯大林格勒和哈尔科夫的拖拉机制造工人，乌克兰的冶金工人，顿巴斯、卡拉甘达和乌拉尔的采煤工人，巴库和巴什基尔的石油工人，卡累利阿—芬兰的木材采伐工人，塔什干和维尔纽斯的纺织工人，伊尔库次克、布列斯特和第比利斯的铁路工人，里加的海港工人、真基列夫州的拖拉机手、阿拉木图州的集体农庄庄员……都投入提高劳动生产率的竞赛巨潮中去。这个竞赛正以全民运动的规模发展着。
    苏联劳动者拥有强大的技术设备，完善的生产组织和高度的技术水平，他们依靠从来不自满的虚心精神和忘我的劳动，在进一步提高劳动生产率和完成五年计划的任务上，一定将取得更大的胜利。
