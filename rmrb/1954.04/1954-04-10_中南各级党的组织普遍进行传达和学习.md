(By our Wuhan correspondent, April 9th) The Central and South China region has universally launched the transmission and study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in accordance with the CPC Central Committee's notice on transmitting and studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, issued a notice on transmitting and studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session as early as March 9th. The notice pointed out: This study should be carried out conscientiously on the basis of in-depth study of the general line and in combination with the review and summary of work. The notice also required leading cadres of departments, ministries, and bureaus (offices) at the Central South China level and above the provincial and municipal levels to thoroughly study and carefully discuss the various documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, and to examine themselves in light of the spirit of the documents, in connection with their own thinking and work, and in connection with their shortcomings in leadership. The notice required party committees at all levels to report to the Central Committee and the Central South China Bureau on the transmission and study of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session on time. The notice also stipulated that the period from mid-March to twenty days to a month would be the time for studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session.

The CPC Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Committee, according to the instructions of the Central South Bureau, arranged for the study of the documents in its subordinate units, and invited Li Xiannian, Third Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau, Zhao Yimin, Minister of Propaganda, and Li Fantian, Second Deputy Minister, to give reports on the transmission to party cadres above the prefectural committee level and the county committee (section chief) level respectively. At the same time, reports on the transmission were made to general party cadres by system.

The Central China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee held two meetings of senior party cadres on March 17th and 25th to convey the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. On the 17th, Comrade Tan Zheng, First Deputy Secretary of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, gave a transmission report. After five days of discussion, Comrade Tao Zhu, Acting Secretary of the South China Branch, gave a concluding speech. Comrade Tao Zhu also made a transmission report to more than 500 senior cadres, including members of the district party committee, deputy directors of the sub-bureau, and directors of government departments.

The Central South Military Region also, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, first launched the transmission and study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session among senior cadres of the troops.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Central South Bureau, the provinces and cities of Central and South China issued notices on the transmission and study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, and formulated plans for studying the resolutions and documents of the Fourth Plenary Session. In each province, the secretary or deputy secretary of the provincial party committee made a transmission report, and discussions were first launched among senior cadres. In Wuhan City, after Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Zhang Pinghua, Second Secretary, made transmission reports to senior cadres and party cadres above the section chief level, the directly subordinate organs of the Municipal Party Committee and the district party committees are convening district committee or party group meetings to further examine issues related to party unity and the system of collective party leadership, in conjunction with the review and summary of work, and in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session. Some party cadres, in the spirit of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, have linked their own thinking and work to more deeply review individualistic thoughts, complacent emotions, and liberalistic styles. The Wuhan Municipal Committee held a meeting from April 2nd to 8th to conscientiously examine work and thought, and plans to have the secretary or deputy secretary continue to make reports on the study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session to party cadres at all levels in mid-April, so that the study of party cadres, especially senior cadres, in the city can be deepened.

In Hubei Province, after Liu Zihou, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Tixue, Deputy Secretary, made transmission reports to senior cadres of directly subordinate organs and party cadres above the section chief level respectively, twelve of the thirty-eight units of directly subordinate organs have begun to examine work in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions. Cadres have a high enthusiasm for learning, and some units have automatically increased the stipulated eight hours of study per week to ten hours or more. The central study group attended by members of the provincial party committee conducted discussions and examinations in light of their own work in accordance with the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, and plans to convey the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session to the high- and middle-level cadres attending the upcoming Party Representative Conference. At the Party Representative Conference convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China from the end of February to mid-March, Comrade Wu Zhipu, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a transmission report on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and examined the work of Henan Province in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions. On the basis of studying the general line, examining, and summarizing work, the directly subordinate organs of the Provincial Party Committee conducted an in-depth examination of the issue of party unity. Other provinces and cities have also made special arrangements for study. Since the study of the directly subordinate organs of the province began in mid-March, many units have entered the stage of examining and summarizing work. In addition to conducting transmission discussions at meetings of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee or enlarged meetings of the Standing Committee, the Provincial Party Committees of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi plan to convene enlarged meetings of the Provincial Party Committee in the near future to further transmit and discuss the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, so as to gradually pass the spirit of the meeting to the prefectural committees, county committees, and the vast number of party cadres.
