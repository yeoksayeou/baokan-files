The various counties of Tianshui Special District, Gansu Province, after concluding the unified grain purchase work, continued to comprehensively publicize the state's grain policies to the farmers, dispelling the ideological concerns of some farmers regarding the handling of surplus grain. Many farmers in Hui County, Tianshui, Liangdang, Gangu, Qingshui and other counties continue to sell surplus grain to the state, and conduct small amounts of mutual grain exchange in rural areas according to state listed prices.

In Tianshui County’s Mudan, Pingnan, Xinlong, Tianshui Town and other markets, an average of 2,000 jin of grain is listed on the market per session recently; in Liangdang County’s state grain market in the county seat, since February 26th, the amount of grain listed on the market per market day has ranged from 900 jin to 1,500 jin; according to statistics from seven state grain markets in Hui County, more than 20,000 jin of miscellaneous grains are listed on the market per session. In addition to direct mutual exchange among farmers, the state grain departments generally purchase more than one-third of these grains. In this way, the problem of food rations has been solved for many grain-deficient households, and the difficulties of some farmers lacking seeds for spring plowing have been resolved.

    甘肃省天水专区全面地宣传粮食政策
    农民互相调剂粮食继续出卖余粮
    甘肃省天水专区各县在结束粮食统购工作以后，继续向农民全面地宣传了国家粮食政策，解除了部分农民对处理余粮方面的思想顾虑。徽县、天水、两当、甘谷、清水等县许多农民继续将余粮卖给国家，并按照国家牌价在农村进行少量的互通有无的粮食交易。
    天水县的牡丹、平南、新陇、天水镇等集市，近来每集平均都有两千斤粮食上市；两当县城的国家粮食市场，从二月二十六日起，每逢集日，粮食的上市量都有九百斤到一千五百斤；徽县七个国家粮食市场的统计，每集上市的杂粮达两万多斤。这些粮食，除了农民直接互通有无以外，国家粮食部门一般收购三分之一以上。这样，就帮助不少缺粮户解决了口粮问题，并使部分农民缺乏春耕籽种的困难得到解决。
