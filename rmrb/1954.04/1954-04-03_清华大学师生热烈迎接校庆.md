Tomorrow, the 4th, is the 43rd anniversary of Tsinghua University. At that time, 20,000 people from various industrial sectors and other units will be invited to visit Tsinghua University. Alumni who have graduated in the past will return to Tsinghua Garden from various construction posts across the country. On the 5th, more than 3,000 middle school students from 49 middle schools in Beijing will come to the university to see how college students study and live. In order to entertain alumni and visitors, various departments will open their department buildings, laboratories, and reference rooms. Each department has prepared an exhibition to explain the department's overview, how teachers are learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reforms, and how to train students to become professionals proficient in specialized technologies through pictures and various physical objects. It will also focus on introducing the role of each major in the national economy and the professional training goals, and display various teaching plans, teaching outlines, work plans, teaching instruments, and models. At the exhibition of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, people can see the growth of new teachers. The exhibition also has a "Expert Work" column to explain the assistance of Soviet experts to us. Each teaching and research group has made many teaching instruments, including self-designed crane models and drawings of new-style casting machines. At the exhibition of the Department of Power Machinery, each laboratory will start diesel engines, air compressors, valve grinding machines, and the recently repaired 200-kilowatt steam turbine. At the exhibition of the Department of Electrical Engineering, more than 150 pictures will provide a detailed introduction to each major. The exhibition also includes a model of a 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line tower that was recently built. The Radio Department laboratory will use physical objects to illustrate the process from the transmitter to the receiver, demonstrate how sound waves use radio waves to propagate to distant places, and install vacuum systems and electron tube manufacturing procedures. In the exhibition of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering, a course design exhibition room will be arranged, and a new hydropower station hub model is being rushed to completion. The hydraulic hub project will also be completed recently and will be open for visits during the anniversary. At the entrance of the Civil Engineering Department's exhibition hall, there is a one-story-high tower crane model. The laboratory has a 10-square-meter model of the Erlangshan area of the Kangzang Highway. Students from the scientific research group will also demonstrate the photoelasticity meter and other instruments they have researched. The architecture department exhibition will use slides to introduce Chinese and Soviet architecture, including ancient Chinese and Western architecture, students' design drawings, creations, and teachers' demonstration drawings. In addition, there is an exhibition of the Workers' and Peasants' Short-Term Middle School in the Biology Museum, introducing the learning situation of worker-peasant cadres and industrial workers.

On the anniversary, teachers and students of various departments of Tsinghua University will respectively hold forums and gatherings with alumni and leaders of industrial departments to ask them to introduce their experiences in their work, listen to their opinions on teaching, and establish regular contacts.
