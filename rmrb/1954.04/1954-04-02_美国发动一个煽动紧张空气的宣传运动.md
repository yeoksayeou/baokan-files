    Xinhua News Agency, 1st - The American ruling clique has been launching a propaganda campaign in recent days to promote America's so-called "resolute attitude," hoping to force countries like France and Britain to obstruct the Geneva Conference, thereby maintaining and intensifying the international tense atmosphere.

    Coinciding with Secretary of State Dulles' speech on the 29th, which demonstrated the U.S. government's "resolute attitude," Assistant Secretary of State Robertson made a statement on the 28th, and Chairman Veli of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others also delivered speeches or statements. The US House Foreign Affairs Committee investigation team, composed of Judd and others, also released a report on the 27th based on their "investigation" of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region last year. According to sources in Washington, after Dulles' speech, a number of other U.S. government officials will follow up with speeches.

    In his statement, Robertson indicated that the United States wants to prevent the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement. He said that Indochina has "extremely important strategic significance," so it must be retained and its "importance is no less than retaining Korea." Robertson also said: "We do not intend to make 'concessions' at the Geneva Conference with our other friends." Senator Mike Mansfield said more straightforwardly on the 28th: "At the Geneva 'Conference', no solution will be reached on the issues of Korea or Indochina."

    Veli worried that "certain allies" of the United States might hope to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference. He publicly proposed that the war in Indochina must continue. He said: France "should persevere as before. We will provide them with the material, training personnel, and expert assistance they need. They should hold the line." The report of the investigation team composed of Judd and others admitted that "the psychological impact of the Korean armistice is obvious there (in Indochina)," and the French invading army and Vietnamese puppet army have "low morale," and the situation in Indochina is "depressing." The report opposes "seeking an armistice" and describes "seeking an armistice" as a so-called "appeasement." The report also advocated submitting the Indochina issue to the United Nations, attempting to turn the Indochina war into a second Korean War.

    Robertson, Veli, and others have repeatedly stated that the United States' policy towards China remains unchanged and that it will continue to be hostile to the Chinese people. Robertson said that the United States will continue to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and continue to support the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan. Judd even hysterically clamored that the United States "must find ways to weaken and destroy Communist China."

    It is no accident that U.S. government officials and members of Congress have launched such a propaganda campaign at this time. According to U.S. news agency reports, negotiations between the United States and its allies on a plan of action at the Geneva Conference are about to begin. The United States' propaganda of its "resolute attitude" is also to put pressure on its allies, mainly France and Britain, to force these countries to violate their own national interests and follow the United States in obstructing the Geneva Conference from achieving positive results.

### 美国发动一个煽动紧张空气的宣传运动

    美国发动一个煽动紧张空气的宣传运动
    【新华社一日讯】美国统治集团这几天来正在发动一个宣传美国的所谓“坚决态度”的运动，希望借此迫使法英等国跟着它阻挠日内瓦会议的进行，以便保持和加剧国际紧张空气。
    配合着美国国务卿杜勒斯二十九日发表的表明美国政府这种“坚决态度”的演说，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在二十八日发表谈话，美国参议院外交委员会主席维利等人也相继发表演说或谈话，由周以德等人组成的美国众议院外交委员会调查团也在二十七日发表了他们去年到东南亚及太平洋地区“调查”后所提出的报告。据华盛顿透露出的消息说，在杜勒斯演说之后，还有一些美国政府官员接着要发表演说。
    罗伯逊在谈话中表示，美国要阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议。他说：印度支那具有“极其重大的战略意义”，因此必须保有印度支那，其“重要性不亚于保有朝鲜”。罗伯逊并说：“我们不打算在日内瓦会议上和我们其他朋友一道”作“让步”。美国参议员迈克·曼斯菲尔德在二十八日更干脆说：在日内瓦“会议上，不会在朝鲜或印度支那问题上得出任何解决办法”。
    维利担心美国的“某些盟国”也许会希望在日内瓦会议上达成协议。他公开提出必须在印度支那打下去。他说：法国“应该像以往那样坚持下去。我们将给予他们需要的物质、训练人员与专家方面的援助。他们应该守住战线”。周以德等人组成的调查团的报告中承认“朝鲜停战的心理影响在（印度支那）那里是明显的”，法国侵略军及越南傀儡军“士气低落”，印度支那局势“令人沮丧”。报告反对“寻求停战”，并把“寻求停战”说成是一种所谓“姑息”。报告并鼓吹把印度支那问题提交联合国，企图把印度支那战争变为第二个朝鲜战争。
    罗伯逊、维利等一再表示美国对中国的政策不变，要继续敌视中国人民。罗伯逊说，美国要继续侵占台湾及澎湖列岛，继续支持台湾国民党残余匪帮。周以德并且歇斯底里地叫嚣，美国“必须找到削弱和摧毁共产党中国的方法”。
    美国政府官员及国会议员选择目前时机发动这样一个宣传运动，并不是偶然的。据美国通讯社消息透露，美国与它的盟国商讨在日内瓦会议上行动计划的谈判即将开始。美国宣传其“坚决态度”，也就是向它的盟国主要是法国和英国施加压力，迫使这些国家违背其本国利益，跟着美国一道来阻挠日内瓦会议获得积极成果。
