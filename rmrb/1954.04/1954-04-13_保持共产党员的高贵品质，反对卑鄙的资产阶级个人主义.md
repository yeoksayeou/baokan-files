    Maintaining the Noble Qualities of a Communist Party Member, Opposing Base Bourgeois Individualism

    The Fourth Plenary Session of our Party emphatically pointed out to the entire Party: In order to strengthen the Party's unity and accomplish the task of socialist revolution, namely the socialist transformation of our country, it is extremely important to resolutely oppose bourgeois individualism existing within the Party. This is because whether the Chinese Communist Party, which leads our country in carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, can vigilantly maintain its solid unity is the guarantee of all victories. However, the bourgeois individualism currently growing within the Party is playing a role in undermining the Party's unity. Therefore, it is necessary to sound the alarm and mobilize the entire Party to oppose base bourgeois individualism in order to overcome the obstacles lying in the path of our people's progress.

    Bourgeois individualism manifests itself in various ways within the Party. Among them, special attention must be paid to the pride and complacency of individualism emphasized in the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" of the Fourth Plenary Session and in the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the Fourth Plenary Session. The emergence of this pride and complacency is either because some achievements have been obtained in work, or because the area where one works is relatively advanced, or because one has been promoted relatively quickly, or because the leadership attaches greater importance, or because one has received some praise or encouragement, thus becoming dizzy with success, forgetting the humble attitude and self-criticism spirit that a Communist Party member must possess. Pride and complacency are very easy to arise in a relatively smooth working environment. Being complacent when work achieves some results can be said to be a fairly common situation among some of our comrades. In fact, today there are indeed some cadres who have become arrogant, so it is even more necessary to oppose the arrogance of individualism.

    The pride and complacency of individualism is very harmful to the cause of the Party. Pride is closely related to relaxation and paralysis. If a person develops pride and complacency, he will not work diligently, and thus will inevitably make serious mistakes. At the same time, pride is a breeding ground for the development of bourgeois individualism. If a person develops pride and complacency, he can only listen to flattery and praise, and cannot accept criticism and supervision. Therefore, there can be no further progress ideologically or politically, and he will lose the ability to resist the attacks of hostile class ideas, only sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism. Originally, only the power of the collective is great. The position of an individual in the revolutionary cause is only a small cog in this great collective. Any individual, no matter what responsibility he assumes in his work, cannot achieve anything without this great collective. However, pride will cause a person to make an extremely incorrect assessment of his role in the revolution, grabbing credit for the "sky" as his own, exaggerating his personal role, thinking he is remarkable, and looking down on others, believing that only he himself, only the department he leads, and only the area he leads are doing well, not acknowledging that others, other departments, and other areas are also doing well or even doing better. He will often feel that the Party does not attach enough importance to him, that his position is too low, and that there is no warmth within the Party, thus gradually becoming alienated from the Party, or even dissatisfied with the Party. This kind of pride is extremely dangerous. If it is not resolutely stopped by the Party, it will gradually develop into serious bourgeois individualism: emphasizing personal prestige, promoting the idea of personal worship (demanding that others worship him), rejecting the supervision and inspection of Party organizations, hating and suppressing criticism, attacking others and elevating himself, vying for power and profit within the Party, engaging in factional activities, treating the department or region he leads as personal capital and an independent kingdom, and even developing into an individualistic careerist or being used by such a careerist, embarking on the criminal path of helping the enemy to sabotage and split the Party.

    In addition to the pride and complacency of individualism, bourgeois individualism within the Party is also manifested in many other aspects. For example, when accepting work assignments, some comrades cannot consider the problem from the needs of the Party, but first consider their so-called prospects for development, status, treatment, and so on. Some comrades have incorrect understanding of the issue of fame, wanting to be the center of attention and to enjoy the Party's honor, but unwilling to bury themselves in hard work and unwilling to be an unsung hero. Some comrades are even afraid to go to work in places with relatively difficult environments, seeking comfort and ease. And when the position has been determined, and after taking on the work assigned by the Party, some comrades are not at ease with their work, and do not earnestly study their profession to do the work the Party has given them well. For example, in personal life, a few comrades, after the victory of the people's democratic revolution, have been influenced by bourgeois ideology, unable to maintain our Party's fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, seeking enjoyment, and some even refuse others to criticize their shortcomings and mistakes in their private lives under the pretext that the Party should not interfere in personal private life.

    Although individualism has various manifestations of different forms and degrees within the Party, and their harm to the revolutionary cause also varies in degree, they are all opposed to proletarian collectivism, and their ideological roots all belong to the bourgeoisie. The proletariat does not privately own any means of production. It must rely on the power of the collective to seize power and carry out socialist and communist construction in order to obtain complete liberation and a happy life. Therefore, the proletariat's outlook on life must be collectivist. The bourgeoisie is the class that privately owns the means of production. Exploiting laborers, defeating opponents in competition, pursuing as much profit as possible, and living a luxurious and corrupt life are their goals. Therefore, the bourgeoisie's outlook on life must be individualistic. The spread of individualism within the Party means the erosion of bourgeois ideology on the Party, which means the shrinking of the working class's ideological front. Therefore, in order to ensure the leadership of the working class and our Party over our country, and to realize the task of socialist transformation of the country, we must oppose all forms of individualism. We must realize that if a Communist Party member does not establish his communist outlook on life, is always vigilant about the dangers of individualism, and strives to overcome all manifestations of individualism in himself, then as long as he encounters an opportunity, less serious individualism will develop into serious individualism. We must nip it in the bud, and when individualism has not developed to such a serious degree, we will carry out an irreconcilable struggle against it and overcome it.

    Some comrades with less political experience believe that imperialism has been driven out of China, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie has been eliminated, the strength of the Chinese working class and our Party has been greatly enhanced, the bourgeoisie has expressed its recognition of the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party in the country, especially after the publicity of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the Party's general line for the transition period, bourgeois ideology has been criticized, and socialist ideology has been increasingly accepted by the broad masses of working people. Therefore, under the current conditions, bourgeois individualistic ideology is no longer a dangerous enemy to the Party, and no longer threatens the Party's unity. This view is completely wrong. It must be recognized that as long as the encirclement of our country by imperialism exists for one day, as long as the encirclement of our Party by the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie exists for one day, bourgeois individualistic ideology will inevitably spread in the weak parts of our Party. Especially when the enemy's direct oppression has been overthrown and our Party is already leading the state power, some cadres cannot see the arduousness of future revolutionary tasks, cannot see the complexity and sharpness of the class struggle during the transition period, and it is very easy for bourgeois individualism to grow. It must be recognized that bourgeois individualism will not automatically withdraw from the historical stage with the development of the revolutionary cause. Not only in the transition period where the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie exist, bourgeois individualism still has a broad range of activities; even after the construction of socialist society is successful and the domestic bourgeoisie is eliminated, bourgeois individualistic ideology will still remain for a very long period. Therefore, in order to prevent bourgeois individualism from threatening the Party's unity, we can only actively carry out ideological struggle. Ideological struggle is one of the forms of struggle between the proletariat and hostile classes. Ignoring ideological struggle will disarm the Party in the face of ideological erosion by hostile classes and will lead to the failure of the revolution.

    Of course, in addition to actively carrying out ideological struggles against bourgeois individualism, it is also necessary to consolidate Party discipline organizationally, adhere to the system of collective leadership, promote intra-Party democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and so on. These are important ways to prevent the development of bourgeois individualism, so they must be adhered to. Any phenomenon of loose organizational life and failure to properly abide by Party principles must be vigorously overcome.

    The Chinese Communist Party has always resolutely opposed bourgeois individualism. Many resolutions of the Party Central Committee, and many works of Comrade Mao Zedong and other responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee, such as the resolution written by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Army of the Red Army in December 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Combat Liberalism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Party Spirit" issued in July 1941, have repeatedly emphasized this point. We should revisit these documents today. The Party Central Committee had already pointed out in the resolution of the Second Plenary Session: we must be vigilant against the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, and continue to maintain the style of humility, prudence, and no arrogance or impatience. In the "Three-Anti" movement in 1952, the Party Central Committee once again required Party cadres to be vigilant against the danger of bourgeois ideological erosion. In the Party rectification movement, education on communism and the Communist Party and education against bourgeois ideology were also widely carried out. Although the Party Central Committee has taken these many measures and achieved great results, bourgeois individualistic ideology within the Party continues to grow. This shows that we must not underestimate the danger of bourgeois individualistic ideology. We must realize that it has deep social roots. We must attach great importance to the warning signal once again issued to the entire Party by this Fourth Plenary Session, resolutely implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, and overcome the danger of bourgeois individualism.

    Opposing bourgeois individualism depends on the conscious efforts of every Communist Party member. Every Communist Party member should deeply realize that the Party is the organizer and inspirer of the victory of our people's democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and therefore should put the interests of the Party first at any time and on any issue, and put personal interests in a subordinate position, strictly abide by the principle of "the interests of the Party are above all else." Party cadres should faithfully implement the Party's political line and organizational line, and fight against all right-leaning or "left-leaning" erroneous ideas that violate the Party's line; they should take maintaining and consolidating the Party's unity as the standard for guiding their words and actions, that is, say words that are conducive to the Party's unity and do not say words that are not conducive to the Party's unity, do things that are conducive to the Party's unity and do not do things that are not conducive to the Party's unity; they should work selflessly, regardless of gains or losses, without fear of hardship; they should humbly learn, and be brave in exposing and correcting their shortcomings and mistakes; they should make their minds only have the Party and the interests of the Party, and not have personal plans that deviate from the Party and the interests of the Party, and make their personal interests completely consistent with the interests of the Party. When the interests of the Party and personal interests conflict, they should unhesitatingly and uncomplainingly obey the interests of the Party and sacrifice personal interests. Our Party has relied on a large number of cadres with this noble quality of Communist Party members as the backbone to lead the people of the whole country to complete the new democratic revolution and establish the People's Republic of China. In the future, Party cadres will be even more required to continue to maintain and develop this noble quality, and serve the people wholeheartedly, diligently, and wholeheartedly, so that the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period can be successfully completed.

    保持共产党员的高贵品质，反对卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义
    我们党的四中全会向全党着重指出：为了增强党的团结，完成我国社会主义革命即社会主义改造的任务，必须坚决反对党内存在着的资产阶级个人主义，这一点是非常重要的。因为领导着我们国家进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的中国共产党能否警觉地保持自己的坚固的团结，是一切胜利的保证。而目前在党内滋长着的资产阶级个人主义，却起着破坏党的团结的作用。因此，必须敲起警钟，动员全党来反对卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义，以克服横在我国人民前进道路上的障碍。
    资产阶级个人主义在党内有各种不同的表现。其中必须特别注意的就是四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”和刘少奇同志在四中全会上所作报告中着重提出的个人主义的骄傲情绪。这种骄傲情绪的产生，或者是因为在工作中获得了若干成绩，或者是因为自己工作的地区比较先进，或者是因为被提拔得较快，或者是因为领导上比较重视，或者是因为受到一些表扬或鼓励，因而就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神。骄傲情绪在比较顺利的工作环境中是很容易产生的。在工作获得一些成绩时沾沾自喜，这在我们一部分同志中间可以说是相当普遍的情形。事实上今天也确实有一部分干部已经骄傲了起来，因此反对个人主义骄傲情绪，也更加必要了。
    个人主义的骄傲情绪对党的事业是十分有害的。骄傲和松懈麻痹是密切关联的。一个人如果滋长着骄傲情绪，他就不会兢兢业业地工作，因而也就不可避免地要犯严重的错误。同时，骄傲是资产阶级个人主义得以发展的温床。一个人如果滋长着骄傲情绪，他就只能听人奉承表扬，不能接受批评监督，于是思想上、政治上就不可能再有什么进步，对敌对阶级思想的袭击就失去了抵抗的能力，只有越来越深地陷到资产阶级个人主义的泥坑中去。本来，只有集体的力量才是伟大的，个人在革命事业中所占的地位只不过是这个伟大的集体中的一个小小的螺丝钉，任何个人，不论他在工作中担负什么责任，离开了这个伟大的集体，是不能得到任何成就的。但是骄傲却会使一个人对自己在革命中的作用作出极不正确的估价，贪“天”之功以为己功，夸大个人的作用，自以为了不起，瞧不起别人，认为只有自己、只有自己领导的部门、自己领导的地区工作做得好，不承认别人、别的部门、别的地区做得也好甚至做得更好。他会常常觉得党对自己重视不够，把自己的地位摆得太低，觉得党内没有什么温暖，因而对党渐渐疏远，甚至对党不满。这种骄傲情绪是极端危险的，如果它不受到党的坚决制止，就会一步一步地发展成为严重的资产阶级个人主义：强调个人威信，宣传个人崇拜的思想（要求别人崇拜自己），拒绝党组织的监督和检查，仇视与压制批评，打击别人、抬高自己，在党内争权夺位、拉拉扯扯、进行小集团活动，把自己领导的部门或地区当作个人资本和独立王国，直至发展成为个人主义的野心家或为这种野心家所利用，走上帮助敌人破坏党、分裂党的罪恶道路。
    除了个人主义的骄傲情绪之外，党内资产阶级个人主义还表现在其他许多方面。例如在接受工作分配时，有的同志不能从党的需要出发来考虑问题，而首先考虑自己的所谓发展前途、地位待遇等等。有些同志对名誉的问题有不正确的认识，风头要由他出，党的荣誉要由他享受，而不愿埋头刻苦地进行工作，不愿做一个无名英雄。甚至有一些同志害怕到环境比较艰苦的地方去工作，贪图舒适和安逸。而当职务已经确定，并且已经担任了党所分配的工作之后，有一些同志就不安心工作，不去认真地钻研业务，做好党交给他的工作。又如在个人生活上，有个别同志，在人民民主革命胜利之后，受到资产阶级思想的影响，不能保持我党艰苦朴素的优良传统，贪图享受，甚至有人以党不应干涉个人私生活为借口，拒绝别人批评他在私生活上的缺点和错误。
    个人主义在党内虽有不同形式、不同程度的各种表现，它们对革命事业的危害在程度上也各不相同，但是它们都是和无产阶级的集体主义对立的，它的思想根源都是属于资产阶级的。无产阶级不私有任何生产资料，它必须依靠集体的力量来夺取政权和进行社会主义与共产主义建设，才能获得彻底解放和美好的幸福生活，因此无产阶级的人生观，就一定是集体主义的。资产阶级是私有生产资料的阶级，是剥削劳动者，在竞争中打倒对方，追求尽可能多的利润，和过奢侈腐化的生活是他们的目的，因此资产阶级的人生观就一定是个人主义的。个人主义在党内的传布就意味着资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，就意味着工人阶级思想阵地的缩小。因此，为了保障工人阶级和我们党对我们国家的领导，为了实现国家社会主义改造的任务，一定要反对形形色色的个人主义。我们必须认识到一个共产党员如果不确立自己共产主义的人生观，时刻警惕着个人主义的危害，并努力克服个人主义在自己身上的一切表现，那么只要遇到机会，比较不严重的个人主义就会发展成为严重的个人主义。我们一定要防微杜渐，在个人主义还没有发展到那么严重程度的时候，就对它进行不调和的斗争，加以克服。
    有一些政治经验比较少的同志，以为帝国主义已被驱逐出中国，官僚资产阶级已被消灭，中国工人阶级和我们党的力量已经大大增强，资产阶级已经表示承认工人阶级和共产党在国家中的领导地位，特别是经过“三反”“五反”和国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传，资产阶级思想已经受到批判，社会主义思想已经日益为广大劳动群众所接受，因此，在目前条件下，资产阶级个人主义思想，对党来说已经不再是什么危险的敌人，已经不再威胁党的团结了。这种看法是完全错误的。必须认识，只要帝国主义对我国的包围存在着一天，只要资产阶级、小资产阶级对我们党的包围存在着一天，资产阶级个人主义思想就不会不在我们党内薄弱的部分传布起来。尤其在敌人的直接压迫被推翻和我们的党已经领导着国家政权的条件下，一部分干部看不见今后革命任务的艰巨，看不见过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂和尖锐，就很容易滋长资产阶级个人主义。必须认识，资产阶级个人主义是不会因革命事业的发展而自动退出历史舞台的，不但在存在着资产阶级和小资产阶级的过渡时期，资产阶级个人主义仍有广阔的活动范围；就是在社会主义社会建设成功，国内资产阶级被消灭之后，资产阶级个人主义思想仍旧会残存一个很长的时期。因此，为了使资产阶级个人主义不能威胁党的团结，就只有积极开展思想斗争。思想斗争是无产阶级和敌对阶级进行斗争的形式之一。忽视思想斗争，就会使党在敌对阶级思想侵蚀面前解除武装，就会使革命遭到失败。
    当然除了积极开展反对资产阶级个人主义的思想斗争以外，还须在组织上巩固党的纪律，坚持集体领导的制度，发扬党内民主，开展批评与自我批评等等。这些是防止资产阶级个人主义发展的重要办法，因此必须坚持。任何组织生活松弛和不能很好遵守党的原则的现象，都是必须大力克服的。
    中国共产党从来坚决反对资产阶级个人主义。党中央的许多决议，毛泽东同志和党中央其他负责同志的许多著作，如毛泽东同志一九二九年十二月为红军第四军第九次党的代表大会所写的决议、毛泽东同志所著的“反对自由主义”“整顿党的作风”“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，一九四一年七月发布的“中共中央关于增强党性的决定”等等，都再三地强调这一点。我们在今天应该重温这些文献。党中央早在二中全会的决议中就已指出：要警惕资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，要继续保持谦虚谨慎和不骄不躁的作风。在一九五二年“三反”运动中，党中央曾再一次要求党的干部警惕资产阶级思想侵蚀的危险。在整党运动中，又普遍进行了关于共产主义和共产党的教育和反对资产阶级思想的教育。尽管党中央采取了这许多措施，是得到了很大的成绩，但是党内资产阶级个人主义思想仍不断滋长。由此可见，我们决不能对资产阶级个人主义思想的危险估计太低。我们一定要认识到它有着深刻的社会根源。我们一定要十分重视这次四中全会再一次向全党发出的警号，坚决执行四中全会的决议，克服资产阶级个人主义的危险。
    反对资产阶级个人主义要靠每个共产党员自觉地努力。每个共产党员应该深切地认识到，党是我国人民民主革命和社会主义革命胜利的组织者和鼓舞者，因而应该在任何时候、任何问题上都把党的利益摆在前面，而把个人的利益摆在从属的地位，严格遵守“党的利益高于一切”的原则。党的干部应该忠实地执行党的政治路线和组织路线，和一切违反党的路线的右倾或“左”倾的错误思想作斗争；应该把维护和巩固党的团结作为指导自己言论和行动的标准，即有利于党的团结的话就说，不利于党的团结的话就不说，有利于党的团结的事就做，不利于党的团结的事就不做；应该不计得失，不辞劳苦，忘我地进行工作；应该虚心学习，勇于揭露和改正自己的缺点和错误；应该使自己的思想中只有党和党的利益，而没有离开党和党的利益的个人打算，使自己个人的利益完全和党的利益一致。当党的利益和个人利益发生矛盾的时候，应该毫不踌躇、毫不勉强地服从党的利益，牺牲个人的利益。我们党就是依靠具有这种共产党员高贵品质的广大干部作为骨干，领导全国人民完成了新民主主义革命，并建立了中华人民共和国，今后就更要求党的干部要继续保持并发扬这种高贵的品质，满腔热忱地、勤勤恳恳地、全心全意地为人民服务，使党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务能够胜利完成。
