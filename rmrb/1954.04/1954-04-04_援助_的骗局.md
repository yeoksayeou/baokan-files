　　The Scam of "Aid"
　　He Sheng
　　No sooner had the Korean War ended than the United States immediately dispatched a "Special Economic Survey Team" to South Korea to study ways to "revive" South Korea. Eisenhower also, like a cat mourning a mouse, personally signed an "aid" plan, boasting that it would "aid" South Korea in carrying out "comprehensive recovery work." He even said that, through the so-called "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency," 70 million US dollars would be spent in 1953 to "revive" South Korea. At the time, the "Premier" of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang puppet government, Baek Doo-jin, expressed his belief that the US master's "aid" to South Korea was "beyond doubt."
　　However, half a year passed, and the reality was not as wonderful as the Syngman Rhee bandit gang had imagined. Even that "Premier," Mr. Baek Doo-jin, could not help but complain that the US master's "revival" work in South Korea was done "too little and too late." After complaining, Baek Doo-jin also listed facts to illustrate that the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" had "a counter-effect on South Korea's financial situation, rather than trying to give its economy a good influence." Baek Doo-jin said: First, as of January 1954, the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" not only imported "aid" materials to South Korea far less than originally planned, but also paid salaries to the agency's staff, which was equal to 39 percent of the value of the imported goods. Second, the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" borrowed the equivalent of 288,000 US dollars worth of South Korean "hwan" from Syngman Rhee last year to build "luxurious residences" for its staff in Busan and pay other expenses, and this amount has not yet been returned to the Syngman Rhee puppet government. Third, the "aid" plan of the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" stipulated that funds would be allocated in 1953 to restore small and medium-sized industries and mines in South Korea, "but in reality, none of these plans have been implemented." Fourth, the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" has always been "willing" to deal with private merchants when implementing the recovery plan, and "often does not consult with the South Korean government."
　　The grievances expressed by this lackey in his disappointment precisely expose the scam of US "aid": nominally the "Korean Reconstruction Agency," it did not go to "revive" (South) Korea, but first went to "revive" its own "agency"; on the one hand, it paid a large amount of money to the salaries of the "Reconstruction Agency" staff, and on the other hand, it spent a large amount of money to build "luxurious residences" for these staff. The money for building the residences was borrowed from the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and "this amount has not yet been returned"! The Syngman Rhee bandit gang, which believed in US "aid" "without a doubt," has "lost both the lady and the soldiers"!
　　Baek Doo-jin's grievances also expose the ugly faces of the Wall Street monopolists who only care about profit: the "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" has always been "willing" to deal with private merchants when implementing its plan to "revive" South Korea. War is for profit, and "aid" is also for profit. As early as the two and a half years of the war period from June 1950 to the end of November 1952, the United States, under the name of "aid," sold more than 570 million US dollars worth of surplus goods to South Korea. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on August 10 last year, the report of the US "Special Economic Survey Team" stated: "The surplus products of the United States, such as butter, skim milk powder, cottonseed oil, peas, and soybeans, may greatly help the relief of (South) Korea." One of the purposes of the US "aid" to South Korea's "revival" is to transport surplus products to South Korea for business!
　　An exclusive report from Seoul published in the Hong Kong English-language "Deccan Herald" on September 25 last year stated: "North Korea is engaged in reconstruction work with one heart and one mind; but in South Korea, it is very difficult to make a systematic plan"; the "reconstruction" work in South Korea is "really dim"! It is no wonder that Baek Doo-jin complained about their American master, wanting to "re-measure the value of the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency"! (Attached picture)
　　The American said to the Turkish old farmer: "Hey, old man, would you like to receive American aid?"
　　The Turkish old farmer replied: "Let's talk about it next time! This year's harvest is really too bad."

### “援助”的骗局

　　“援助”的骗局
    禾生
    朝鲜刚刚停战，美国就马上派遣了“经济特别调查团”到南朝鲜去，研究“复兴”南朝鲜的办法；艾森豪威尔也猫哭耗子似地亲自签署了一项“援助”计划，吹嘘着“援助”南朝鲜进行“全面恢复工作”；还说要通过所谓“联合国朝鲜复兴局”，在一九五三年花费七千万美元来“复兴”南朝鲜。当时，李承晚匪帮伪政府的“总理”白斗镇曾表示，相信美国主子对南朝鲜的“援助”是“毫无疑问”的。
    可是，时过半年，事实并不如李承晚匪帮想象的那样美妙。就连那位“总理”先生白斗镇也不能不埋怨美国主子在南朝鲜的“复兴”工作做得“太少而且太迟”了。白斗镇在埋怨之后，并且列举了事实，说明“联合国朝鲜复兴局”“对南朝鲜的财政情况起了反作用，而并不是设法来给它的经济以好的影响。”白斗镇说：一，到一九五四年一月为止“联合国朝鲜复兴局”不仅是向南朝鲜输入的“援助”物资比原来计划的差得很多，而且付给该局工作人员的薪金，就等于输入货物价值的百分之三十九。二，“联合国朝鲜复兴局”去年一年中向李承晚借了等于二十八万八千美元的南朝鲜“圜币”，用来为该局在釜山的职员建造“华贵的住宅”和偿付其他费用，而这笔款项至今还没有还给李承晚伪政府。三，“联合国朝鲜复兴局”的“援助”计划规定在一九五三年拨款恢复南朝鲜的中小工业和矿山，“可是实际上这些计划一点也没有执行”。四，“联合国朝鲜复兴局”在执行恢复计划时，一直“愿意”和民间私商打交道，“经常不和韩国政府磋商。”
    这位奴才在失望之余发出的怨言，恰恰把美国“援助”的骗局揭穿了：名为“朝鲜复兴局”，却没有去“复兴”（南）朝鲜，而首先去“复兴”他们自己的“局”去了；一方面把一大批钱发了“复兴局”职员的薪金，一方面又把一大批钱去为这些职员们盖了“华贵的住宅”，盖住宅的钱还是向李承晚匪帮借的，而且“这笔款项至今还没有还”！相信美国“援助”“毫无疑问”的李承晚匪帮是“赔了夫人又折兵”！
    白斗镇的怨言同时也揭穿了唯利是图的华尔街垄断资本家的丑恶的嘴脸：“联合国朝鲜复兴局”在执行其“复兴”南朝鲜的计划时，一直“愿意”和民间私商打交道。战争为了利润，“援助”同样也为了利润。远在一九五○年六月到一九五二年十一月末的两年半的战争时期，美国就以“援助”为名，向南朝鲜推销了价值五亿七千多万美元的剩余商品。又据合众社去年八月十日华盛顿电讯报道：美国“经济特别调查团”的报告中说：“美国的牛油，脱脂奶粉、棉子油、豌豆和大豆等剩余产品，可能会大大有助于对（南）朝鲜的救济。”美国“援助”南朝鲜“复兴”的目的之一，就是把剩余产品运到南朝鲜去做生意！
    去年九月二十五日香港英文“德臣西报”刊登的一篇汉城专电曾这样说过：“北朝鲜从事重建工作，是大家一条心；但在南朝鲜，要作出一个有系统的计划，是非常困难的”；南朝鲜的“重建”工作“实在渺茫”！这就无怪乎白斗镇埋怨他们的美国主子，要“来重新衡量联合国朝鲜复兴局的价值”了！（附图片）
    美国人对土耳其老农说：“喂，老头，你愿意得到美国的援助吗？”
    土耳其老农答道：“下次再说吧！今年的收成确实太坏了。”
