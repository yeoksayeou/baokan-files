    The spring cocoons in various regions are about to be on the market. Based on the needs of domestic and foreign markets and the policy of actively developing silk production in a planned way, the China Silk Company recently formulated and announced the fresh cocoon purchase prices for 1954. The medium standard price for improved fresh cocoons in the East China region (based on 832 jin of cocoons yielding 100 jin of silk), using Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu as the standard, is 7.3 million yuan per shi dan for spring cocoons and 7.5 million yuan per shi dan for autumn cocoons. This year's fresh cocoon purchase prices are higher than last year. The spring cocoon purchase prices in Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu in the East China region are 4.3 percent higher than last year, and the autumn cocoon prices are 4.17 percent higher; the purchase price of white cocoons in Guangdong region is 6.75 percent higher, and yellow cocoons are 12.9 percent higher.

    When announcing the fresh cocoon purchase prices, the China Silk Company required silk companies in various regions to do a good job in training cocoon grading and inspection personnel, to conscientiously evaluate the quality, and, without affecting the planting area of ​​grain and cotton, to mobilize silkworm farmers to make full use of vacant land to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, and to increase production in a planned manner.

    The Guangdong Branch of the China Silk Company, in order to help farmers solve some of the difficulties in mulberry planting and silkworm rearing and gradually bring cocoon production into the orbit of the national plan, has launched cocoon pre-purchase work in the three counties of Shunde, Nanhai, and Zhongshan and the silkworm farming areas along the West River since mid-March. The pre-purchase varieties include white cocoons, sha qing cocoons, and yellow cocoons, and the pre-purchase quantity will reach 30 to 50 percent of the total product of silkworm farmers. A portion of the cocoon payment is prepaid during the pre-purchase, and each pre-selling household in Shunde County can receive an average prepayment of about 400,000 yuan. In order to further help mulberry-planting farmers with production, Shunde and other counties will mobilize silkworm farmers to order mulberry leaves from mulberry farmers based on the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, so as to closely coordinate the two productions of silkworm rearing and mulberry planting.

    中国丝绸公司制定今年鲜茧收购价格
    广东省丝绸公司及时展开蚕茧预购工作
    各地春茧即将上市。中国丝绸公司根据国内外市场的需要和有计划地积极发展蚕丝生产的方针，日前制定并公布了一九五四年的鲜茧收购价格。华东地区改良鲜茧中准价（按八百三十二斤茧子可缫一百斤丝计算），以浙江、苏南两地为标准，春茧每市担为七十三万元，秋茧每市担为七十五万元。今年鲜茧收购价格比去年有所提高。华东区浙江、苏南两地春茧收购价格，较去年提高百分之四点三，秋茧价格提高百分之四点一七；广东地区白茧收购价格提高百分之六点七五，黄茧提高百分之十二点九。
    中国丝绸公司在公布鲜茧收购价格时，要求各地丝绸公司做好评茧验货人员的训练工作，认真按质评价，并在不影响粮食、棉花种植面积的原则下，发动蚕农充分利用空隙土地，栽桑养蚕，有计划地增加产量。　　　　　　　（温纯洁）
    中国丝绸公司广东分公司为了帮助农民解决种桑养蚕中的一些困难，逐步把蚕茧生产纳入国家计划轨道，从三月中旬起在顺德、南海、中山三个县和西江一带养蚕地区展开蚕茧预购工作。预购品种包括白茧、沙青茧和黄茧，预购数量将达蚕农全部产品的百分之三十至五十。预购中预付一部分茧款，顺德县平均每户预售户可得四十万元左右的预付款。为了进一步帮助种桑农民进行生产，顺德等县将发动蚕农根据自愿互利的原则，向桑农订购桑叶，使养蚕和种桑这两项生产密切配合。
