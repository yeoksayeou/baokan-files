    Joint State-Private Hankou Shenfu Xin Co., Ltd. Officially Established

    The joint state-private Hankou Shenfu Xin Co., Ltd. was formally established on April 9th, and a signing ceremony for the joint state-private agreement was held. This company includes the Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company and the Hankou Factory of Fuxin Fifth Flour Company. These two factories were respectively put under joint state-private ownership on January 1st and March 1st of this year.

    Li Guowei, Chairman of the Joint State-Private Hankou Shenfu Xin Co., Ltd., published an article in the Changjiang Daily on the occasion of the company's formal establishment, saying: The Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company and the Hankou Factory of Fuxin Fifth Flour Company have signed a joint state-private agreement. I feel very honored and very happy. During the short period after the Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company and the Hankou Factory of Fuxin Fifth Flour Company implemented joint state-private ownership, thanks to the correct leadership of the state-owned shares and the efforts of all employees, there has been rapid progress in both basic construction and production. This illustrates the superiority of state capitalism over general capitalism, giving us a deeper understanding and experience of it, and establishing our firm and unwavering confidence. I dare say that besides following the direction indicated by the general line of the state during the transition period and embarking on the path of state capitalism, there is no brighter path for us private industrialists and businessmen. Zhu Jiu, a national textile industry labor model from the Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company, said in a statement: "All employees of our Shenxin and Fuxin factories should, under the leadership of the Party and the administration, continue to deeply study and implement the Party's general line during the transition period, overcome all difficulties, improve technical and management levels, carry out labor emulation drives, better complete national plans; in particular, we must continuously improve product quality in production, minimize waste, reduce costs, better meet the needs of the people, accumulate more funds for the country, and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization."

    Both the Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company and the Hankou Factory of Fuxin Fifth Flour Company are large-scale private factories that have been established for more than 30 years. After the liberation of Wuhan, the People's Government gave great support to them, entrusting the two factories to process cotton yarn and flour, so that the production of the two factories gradually developed. The capitalists of the two factories requested the Wuhan Municipal People's Government in October 1953 to implement joint state-private ownership, and with the approval of the People's Government, joint state-private ownership was implemented successively. Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the Hankou Factory of Shenxin Fourth Textile Company has overfulfilled its production plan every month for three months. 8,400 of the 20,000 new spindles invested in and expanded by the People's Government have been put into production.

    公私合营汉口申福新有限公司正式成立
    公私合营汉口申福新有限公司在四月九日正式成立，并举行了公私合营协议书签字仪式。这个公司包括申新第四纺织公司汉口厂和福新第五面粉公司汉口厂，这两个工厂先后在今年一月一日和三月一日实行公私合营。
    公私合营汉口申福新有限公司董事长李国伟在公司正式成立时，在长江日报发表文章说：申新第四纺织公司汉口厂、福新第五面粉公司汉口厂签订了公私合营协议书。我感觉非常荣幸，非常愉快。申新第四纺织公司汉口厂和福新第五面粉公司汉口厂在实行公私合营后的这一个很短促的期间内，由于公股领导的正确和全体职工的努力，无论在基本建设方面或是在生产方面，都是突飞猛进。这说明了国家资本主义比一般资本主义的优越性，使我们对它有了更深一层的认识和体会，树立了我们坚定不移的信心。我敢说除了遵循国家在过渡时期总路线所指示的方向，走上国家资本主义的道路外，我们私营工商业者再没有更光明的途径。申新第四纺织公司汉口厂的全国纺织工业劳动模范朱玖发表谈话说：“我们申新、福新两厂全体职工今后都应该在党和行政的领导下，继续深入学习和贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线，克服一切困难，提高技术水平和管理水平，开展劳动竞赛，更好地完成国家计划；特别要在生产中不断提高产品质量，尽量减少浪费，降低成本，更好地满足人民需要，多为国家积累资金，为实现国家的社会主义工业化而努力。”
    申新第四纺织公司汉口厂和福新第五面粉公司汉口厂都是已经创建三十多年、规模较大的私营工厂。武汉市解放后，人民政府曾给予大力扶植，委托两厂加工棉纱和面粉，因而两厂生产逐步得到发展。两厂资方在一九五三年十月向武汉市人民政府请求实行公私合营，经人民政府批准先后实行公私合营。申新第四纺织公司汉口厂自实行公私合营后，三个月来月月超额完成了生产计划，人民政府投资扩建的两万枚纱锭已有八千四百枚投入生产。
