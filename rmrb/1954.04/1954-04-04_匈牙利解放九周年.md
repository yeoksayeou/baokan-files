Nine years ago, on April 4, 1945, the Soviet army liberated Hungary from the shackles of German fascism. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian working people took control of their homeland's destiny and transformed the semi-feudal, reactionary Hungary into a country of their own. The experience of the past nine years proves that the Hungarian people can fully enjoy the true freedom they have gained.

Under the leadership of the working class, the Hungarian working people crushed all the conspiracies of the landlords and capitalists who attempted to restore the former reactionary, capitalist, and semi-feudal Hungary. In 1948, Hungary's people's democratic system and the power of the working class were further consolidated.

In the short three-year period after the war, thanks to the heroic efforts of workers, working peasants, and intellectuals, the wounds of war were healed, the recovery period ended, and the country was prepared for socialist industrialization.

In all the struggles of the Hungarian working people to consolidate the people's democratic system, restore the national economy, and oppose the capitalists and landlords, the Communists always stood at the forefront. Due to their exemplary work, the Hungarian Communist Party gained extensive influence in both cities and villages in a very short period of time.

Relying on the great economic and political achievements made in establishing and consolidating the people's democratic system, our country began socialist industrialization and laid the foundation for the socialist component of agriculture.

In the past few years, Hungary's industry, especially heavy industry, has developed by leaps and bounds. Currently, industrial production has increased two and a half times compared to the level of 1938. Hungary has now become an industrial country. In 1953, our country mined 21.3 million tons of coal, compared to only 9.5 million tons in 1938; the electricity produced in 1953 was 4.6 billion kilowatt-hours, compared to only 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours in 1938. As a result of this development, heavy industry is now able to supply light industry and agriculture with basic raw materials, machinery, and other means of production. This makes it possible to slow down the development speed of heavy industry and turn to the production of daily necessities. In 1953, Hungary's textile industry produced 209 million meters of cotton fabric, the shoe industry produced 8.4 million pairs of boots and shoes; sugar production increased by 71.2 percent, and soap increased by 22.2 percent. New socialist industrial cities have been established in large numbers, and the first modern blast furnace in the largest city, Stalinvaros, has recently begun production. Many new factories have been established in these years. Hungarian industry has begun to produce many machines, harvesters, threshers, trucks, and other products that were unimaginable to produce domestically before liberation. Better quality and more goods are being shipped from the cities to the countryside. In 1953 alone, the Hungarian countryside received more than 1,200 combine harvesters and thousands of other agricultural machines.

However, Hungary's agricultural production has lagged behind industrial production. It has hardly exceeded pre-war levels, although agricultural production should not be neglected. Extensive changes have taken place in the countryside. The socialist transformation of agriculture is underway. The cooperative movement of peasants has now gained a solid foundation, and the number of members of agricultural cooperatives accounts for nearly one-fifth of all working peasants. Three hundred and sixty-four machine tractor stations have been organized, owning more than 10,000 tractors, which can provide appropriate assistance not only to cooperative members but also to individual farmers.

The relative backwardness of agricultural production hinders the steady improvement of the people's living standards. In recent months, the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian government have paid great attention to agriculture. As a result of the adoption of some measures, it is now entirely possible to further promote agricultural production, fully supply residents with all important agricultural products, and substantially expand the raw material base of light industry and the food industry.

In addition to continuing to expand the achievements of socialist industrialization, the Hungarian working people are working to increase agricultural output so that residents can obtain a full supply of all important agricultural products.

Despite the relative backwardness in agriculture, Hungarian farmers still achieved a bumper harvest in 1953. Grain increased by 720,000 tons compared to 1952, potatoes by 730,000 tons, and corn by 1.39 million tons. Due to the increase in agricultural investment, farmers' welfare will be further improved in 1954. Farmers will receive thousands of agricultural machines to reduce their labor and increase yields.

Along with the development of the national economy, the level of culture has also greatly improved. Eight-year general education and compulsory education have been widely promoted. Compared with before liberation, the number of secondary schools has tripled, and the number of university students has increased almost fourfold. The vast number of people in urban and rural areas have been able to read newspapers. The number of people subscribing to radios has increased to two and a half times that of before the war. Tens of thousands of working people have participated in various political and vocational study groups. All this proves that the cultural revolution is advancing alongside the development of the people's economic undertakings and the country's socialist industrialization. After liberation, due to large-scale price reductions, the living standards of the Hungarian people improved, the quantity of daily necessities increased, and the people's purchasing power also increased. In November 1953, due to the government's policy of reducing prices, market prices decreased by 13.3 percent compared to the same period in 1952. In one year, residents saved a total of 1.2 billion forints due to price reductions. In one year, the appropriation used to increase wages was 762 million forints. Pensions will increase by 200 million forints annually. The Hungarian people enjoy more food, better clothes, and more cultural entertainment activities than ever before. For example, in 1953 compared to 1952, meat consumption increased by 23 percent, sugar by 18 percent, men's clothing by 23.6 percent, and children's boots and shoes by 16.4 percent.

The political foundation for economic and cultural achievements is the alliance of the working class and the working peasants under the leadership of the working class. This alliance was established after national liberation and the implementation of land reform. It has been further consolidated in the struggle to strengthen the national economic system. The resolutions passed last year by the Party and the government aimed at continuing to greatly improve the living standards of the working people and expanding agricultural production have further strengthened the relationship between urban and rural areas and consolidated the alliance of the working class and the working peasants. After the Hungarian Working People's Party adopted these measures, the Hungarian people are uniting more closely to strive to achieve the goals stipulated in these measures.

Since liberation in 1945, the prerequisite for the Hungarian working people to achieve all these achievements is due to the existence of the Soviet Union and the friendship and assistance of the Soviet people. Only because the glorious Soviet army crushed the fascist aggressors did it open the way for Hungary's free development. The support of the Soviet Union helped the Hungarian Working People's Party to promptly crush the conspiracies of domestic reactionary forces, which attempted to rely on the imperialists to restore the former semi-feudal Hungary. Close political and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the great People's Republic of China has made it possible for Hungary to maintain its political and economic independence and successfully safeguard the achievements made by the working people in the past nine years.

The Hungarian people warmly welcome the Soviet Union's proposals at the Berlin Conference regarding the consolidation of world peace. The Hungarian people firmly oppose the rearmament of Germany, because they have not forgotten that German imperialism has dragged Hungary into two disastrous wars in the past century. This is why the government of the Hungarian People's Republic announced its unconditional support for the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a "Pan-European Treaty to Ensure Collective Security in Europe."

The Hungarian people will resolutely stand in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight for lasting world peace. The Hungarian people are also determined to consolidate all the achievements made in socialist construction.

    匈牙利解放九周年
    匈牙利人民共和国部长会议第一副主席  安德拉希·赫格居斯
    九年以前，一九四五年四月四日，苏联军队把匈牙利从德国法西斯的枷锁下解放了出来。在苏联的帮助下，匈牙利劳动人民掌握了自己祖国的命运，把半封建的、反动的匈牙利变成了劳动人民自己的国家。过去九年的经验证明，匈牙利人民能够充分享受他们所获得的真正的自由。
    在工人阶级的领导下，匈牙利劳动人民粉碎了地主和资本家们企图恢复以前反动的、资本主义的和半封建的匈牙利的一切阴谋。一九四八年，匈牙利的人民民主制度和工人阶级的政权更加巩固了。
    在战后短短的三年时期内，由于工人们、劳动农民和知识分子的英勇努力，战争创伤得到了医治，恢复时期结束了，全国为实行社会主义工业化作好了准备工作。
    在匈牙利劳动人民为巩固人民民主制度与恢复国民经济、反对资本家和地主们的所有的斗争中，共产党员们永远站在最前列。由于他们的模范的工作，匈牙利共产党在很短的几年内就在城市和乡村里获得了十分广泛的影响。
    依靠着在建立和巩固人民民主制度中所获得的经济上和政治上的巨大成就，我国开始了社会主义工业化，并奠定了农业社会主义成分的基础。
    在过去的几年中，匈牙利的工业，首先是重工业，飞跃地向前发展了。目前工业生产已较一九三八年的水平增加了两倍半。匈牙利现在已变成了一个工业国。一九五三年我国开采了二千一百三十万吨煤，而一九三八年仅为九百五十万吨；一九五三年所生产的电力是四十六亿瓩时，而一九三八年却只有十四亿瓩时。由于这样发展的结果，重工业现在已经能够供给轻工业和农业以基本原料、机器和其他生产工具。这样就有可能把重工业的发展速度延缓下来转向日用品工业的生产方面去。一九五三年，匈牙利纺织工业生产了两亿零九百万公尺的棉织品，制鞋工业生产了八百四十万双靴鞋；糖类生产增加了百分之七十一点二，肥皂增加了百分之二十二点二。新的社会主义工业城市大量地建立起来了，其中最大的斯大林瓦罗斯城的第一个新式鼓风炉，已在不久以前开始生产了。在这几年当中，许多新工厂已经建立起来了。匈牙利的工业已经开始生产许多机器、收割机、打谷机、载货卡车和其他产品，在解放以前，在国内生产这些产品是不可想像的。质量方面更好更多的货物正从城市源源地运送到乡村中去。只在一九五三年一年中，匈牙利的乡村就得到了一千二百多台联合收割机和几千台其他农业机器。
    但匈牙利在农业生产方面却落后于工业生产了。它几乎还没有超过战前水平，虽然对农业生产是不应忽视的。农村中已发生了广泛的变化。农业的社会主义改造正在进行着。农民的合作化运动目前已获得了巩固的基础，农业合作社的社员数目几占全体劳动农民的五分之一。已经组织起来的机器拖拉机站有三百六十四个，拥有一万多台拖拉机，不仅能对合作社社员，而且也能对个体农民进行适当的帮助。
    农业生产的相对落后，阻碍着人民生活水平的稳步提高。最近几个月以来，匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利政府已对农业予以极大的重视。由于采用了一些措施的结果，目前已完全有可能来进一步促进农业生产，充分供应居民以一切重要的农产品和相当地扩充轻工业和食品工业的原料基础。
    匈牙利劳动人民除了继续努力扩大社会主义工业化的成果以外，正致力于提高农业产量，以便使居民获得一切重要农产品的充分供应。
    尽管农业方面相对的落后，匈牙利农民在一九五三年还是获得了丰收。谷物比一九五二年增加了七十二万吨，马铃薯七十三万吨，玉蜀黍一百三十九万吨。由于对农业投资的增加，一九五四年中，农民福利将更进一步地提高。农民们将获得几千架农业机器，以减轻他们的劳动和增加收获量。
    与国民经济发展的同时，文化水平也大大地提高了。八年制的普通教育和义务教育已在广泛推行。与解放前相比，中等学校增加了两倍，大学生人数增加了几乎四倍。广大的城乡人民已能够阅读报纸。订购收音机的人数比战前提高到两倍半。成千成万的劳动人民参加了各种政治和职业学习小组。所有这一切证明，文化革命正与人民经济事业的发展和国家社会主义工业化并肩前进着。解放以后，由于大规模的减低物价，匈牙利人民的生活水平提高了，日用品的数量增加了，人民购买力也提高了。一九五三年十一月，由于政府实行了减低物价的政策，市场价格与一九五二年的同一时期相比，降低了百分之十三点三。一年中，由于物价降低而使居民总共节省了十二亿福林。一年中用来增加工资的拨款是七亿六千二百万福林。养老金每年将增加两亿福林。匈牙利人民比以前任何时候享受到更多的食品，更好的衣服和更多的文化娱乐活动。例如，一九五三年与一九五二年相比，肉的消费量增加了百分之二十三，糖百分之十八，男人服装百分之二十三点六，儿童靴鞋百分之十六点四。
    经济方面和文化方面获得成就的政治基础，是以工人阶级为领导的工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟。这个联盟是在全国解放和土地改革实行以后建立起来的。它在加强国民经济制度的斗争中得到了更进一步的巩固。去年党和政府所通过的旨在继续大大提高劳动人民生活水平和扩大农业生产的决议，进一步地加强了城乡之间的关系，巩固了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟。在匈牙利劳动人民党采取了这些措施之后，匈牙利人民正在更加紧密地团结起来，为实现这些措施所规定的目标而奋斗。
    自从一九四五年解放以来，匈牙利劳动人民获得这一切成就的先决条件，是由于苏联的存在和苏联人民的友谊援助。只是由于光荣的苏联军队粉碎了法西斯侵略者，才为匈牙利的自由发展打开了道路。苏联的支持帮助了匈牙利劳动人民党及时地粉碎了国内反动势力的阴谋，这些反动势力曾企图依靠帝国主义者来恢复从前半封建的匈牙利。与苏联、各人民民主国家以及伟大的中华人民共和国在政治和经济上的密切合作，使得匈牙利有可能保持自己政治上和经济上的独立，并且成功地维护了劳动人民在过去九年中所取得的成就。
    匈牙利人民热烈欢迎苏联在柏林会议上所提出的有关巩固世界和平的建议。匈牙利人民坚决反对德国的重新武装，因为他们并没有忘记：德国帝国主义在近百年中曾把匈牙利两次拖入灾难性的战争中。这就是何以匈牙利人民共和国政府宣布无条件拥护苏联关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。
    匈牙利人民将坚决站在以苏联为首的和平阵营中，为世界持久和平而斗争。匈牙利人民并且决心巩固在社会主义建设中所获得的一切成就。
