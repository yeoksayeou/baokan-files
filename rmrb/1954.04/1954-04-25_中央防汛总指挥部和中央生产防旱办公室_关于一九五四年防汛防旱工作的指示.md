    Instructions from the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Central Drought Relief Office
    Regarding Flood Control and Drought Relief Work in 1954
    In recent years, China's water conservancy construction has made great progress, playing a certain role in guaranteeing agricultural production. However, because eliminating water and drought disasters is a long-term struggle, in order to reduce disasters every year, in addition to continuing to build water conservancy projects, it is necessary to lead the masses to fully utilize existing water conservancy facilities and strengthen the fight against flood and drought.
    The task of flood control and drought relief in 1954 is to strive to prevent major rivers from experiencing serious breaches and changes of course, to ensure that general rivers do not breach their dikes below the guaranteed water level and to strive to defend against even greater floods, while also seeking to prevent or reduce possible droughts and floods.
    In order to do a good job in this year's flood control and drought relief work, in addition to continuing to implement the instructions of the Government Administration Council, the Central Flood Control Headquarters, and the Central Drought Relief Office over the years, the following instructions are specifically made:

  I. Raise Vigilance, Oppose Complacency
    The biggest obstacle in flood control and drought relief work over the years has been complacency in leadership thinking. Some believe that many projects have already been completed, and some experience in flood control and drought relief has been accumulated, so they feel secure; others blindly optimistic when the weather is temporarily favorable, or think that floods do not necessarily occur every year, and become complacent; therefore, they do not prepare in advance, are lax in defense during the flood season, or rush to respond when drought has already formed, resulting in a phenomenon of chaos and passivity, or even causing unnecessary disasters. In order to eliminate these complacent thoughts and侥幸心理 (jiǎoxìng xīnlǐ, a lucky mindset/relying on luck), first of all, all local leading organs and leading cadres are required to pay attention, constantly and clearly grasp the actual situation of their regions and river basins in depth, raise vigilance, improve foresight, oppose complacency, and repeatedly educate cadres and the masses to ensure the implementation of flood control and drought relief work.

    II. Inspect and Repair Projects, Ensure Quality, and Strengthen the Management and Utilization of Existing Projects
    From the dikes and dams of major rivers to the publicly and privately owned ponds, embankments, wells, and waterwheels in rural areas, all are material forces for flood and drought prevention, and all must be subjected to a general inspection and necessary repairs to maximize their benefits. During last year's flood season, many pond and dam projects did not meet standards, or lacked flood discharge equipment, resulting in being washed away by floods; some culverts leaked water; and some flood control projects collapsed before reaching the guaranteed water level due to poor quality or insufficient inspection. In terms of project management, some dikes lack management in peacetime, and pre-flood inspections are insufficient, so hidden dangers still exist; some ponds and dams lack sufficient water storage due to poor management, and water is wasted, resulting in drought and water shortages, and even causing water disputes. All of the above should be taken as important lessons.
    This year, in terms of flood control in major rivers, it is required to strengthen the inspection of completed projects (especially the inspection and cone penetration tests of dikes), ensure project quality, improve management institutions, and formulate appropriate management and control measures based on various flood situations, taking into account the upstream and downstream as a whole. Problems existing in the planned flood diversion, flood detention, and flood storage areas should be solved in a timely manner.
    In terms of general rivers, in addition to checking and consolidating existing dikes, special attention should be paid to rivers with extremely different dry season flow and flood flow. Because these rivers usually have less water flow, the riverbed and dikes are most vulnerable to natural and man-made damage. Obstacles in the riverbed that affect flood discharge and drainage should be removed as soon as possible.
    For rivers with serious disasters, in order to defend against even greater floods and reduce disasters in a planned way, temporary measures for flood diversion, flood detention, and flood storage can be planned in advance. However, it must be based on on-site investigation and scientific calculation, approved by the party and government leading organs above the provincial level, and compensation or relief methods must be formulated and explained to the masses. This is an important key to whether temporary measures can be implemented and must be paid attention to.
    In areas frequently suffering from floods, the drainage systems such as ditches and culverts should be carefully inspected, and the masses should be organized to carry out necessary repairs. For some low-lying areas with no outlet for drainage, with the consent of the masses, water storage and drainage should be planned as a whole in order to reduce disasters. Water drainage disputes between upstream and downstream should be resolved as soon as possible.
    In terms of drought prevention: the main keys to drought prevention in paddy fields in the south are timely water storage, leak prevention and water retention, and rational water use. Now, the masses should be mobilized to conduct a general inspection and repair of various water storage facilities, and rainwater and river and lake water should be diverted and stored as much as possible; in drought-prone areas, various possible water sources should continue to be explored and utilized, and field ridges should be repaired and protected to reduce water loss in the fields; for decentralized small ponds and embankments, the beneficiary masses should be actively led to negotiate management and maintenance conventions, implement organized water use, and save water. In areas with conditions, mechanical drainage and irrigation equipment can be appropriately developed on the basis of key pilot projects.
    In the north, in addition to generally promoting soil moisture conservation through plowing and harrowing, the development of well, waterwheel, and canal irrigation should be continued, water use management should be strengthened, advanced experiences such as shallow irrigation, ridge irrigation, and ditch irrigation should be promoted, and flooding irrigation should be opposed to expand the irrigation area and prevent soil alkalization.
    In recent years, in Shandong, Anhui and other flood-prone and drought-prone areas, various methods such as ditches, ridges, and raised fields have been tried to disperse water storage, so that flood prevention and drought prevention are combined; or suitable crops are replanted to reduce disasters. Various places have achieved certain results in promoting soil and water conservation in mountainous areas. These land and forest improvement works with broad mass participation are one of the fundamental measures to control water and drought disasters and should be paid more attention to further promotion in spring production.
    Basic construction projects under construction should be prepared for protection as soon as possible to ensure preparedness. At the same time, ensure timely completion so that it can play a role in time.

    III. Grasp the Situation, Improve Foresight, and Strengthen the Overall Combination of Flood Control, Drought Relief, and Flood Prevention
    After China's climate enters the flood season, there is always the possibility of heavy rain. When rivers rise, waterlogging disasters often occur at the same time; but during this period, various crops need a lot of water, and a slight lack of rainfall can easily lead to drought; therefore, drought followed by flooding, flooding followed by drought, or the simultaneous occurrence of floods and waterlogging are situations that almost all places may encounter. Therefore, flood control, drought relief, and flood prevention work should be closely combined and should not be neglected. However, the phenomenon of disconnection between flood control and drought relief still occurs in some areas. Some areas even dug dikes or opened culverts without closing them to divert water for irrigation during drought relief, resulting in floods; some areas emptied ponds to prevent floods, which weakened drought prevention capabilities; and many areas only paid attention to defending the dikes of larger rivers in flood control, and lacked leadership in the drainage and flood prevention work of the vast farmland.
    This year, all localities are required to implement past instructions and earnestly achieve the overall combination of flood control, drought relief, and flood prevention. In drought relief and drought resistance work, preparations for flood control must be noted, and after heavy rain, water storage for drought prevention must be noted. At the same time, it is necessary to distinguish between major and minor issues according to the current local situation and grasp different priorities.
    In order to improve foresight, flood forecasting should be strengthened and the scope of forecasting should be expanded as much as possible. In areas affected by typhoons and where mountain floods often occur, special attention should be paid to forecasting disastrous weather in order to avoid or reduce disasters. The forecasting of disastrous weather, the measurement and analysis of rainfall and water conditions, and the reporting of disaster prevention and drought resistance in agricultural production should all be combined to study and master the relationship between rainfall and crop growth, so that scientific analysis and forecasting can play a greater guiding role in the local flood control, flood prevention, and drought relief work at that time.

    IV. Strengthen the Organizational Leadership of Flood Control and Drought Relief, and Closely Link All Aspects
    Relying on the masses, summarizing and promoting the experience of the masses is the main guarantee for overcoming water and drought disasters. At present, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is playing a role in promoting the development of agricultural production. Relying on organized forces to do a good job in flood control and drought relief, and resolving the contradiction between flood control, drought relief and production, is not only conducive to the consolidation and development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but also drives the general farmers to strengthen water conservancy facilities and prevent natural disasters.
    Flood control and drought relief is an important work that runs through the entire agricultural production process from spring plowing to autumn harvest, and requires leadership organs at all levels to pay close attention to it at all times and strengthen leadership. It is necessary to mobilize all forces to rush to rescue when the flood or drought situation is tense. But experience has shown that the victory of flood control and drought relief mainly depends on regular preparatory work and timely preventive measures. Paying attention to regular maintenance and defense in flood control can reduce dangerous situations and avoid waste of manpower and material resources. In terms of drought prevention, because drought is gradually formed, it is easiest to lose vigilance before it becomes a disaster. Therefore, in drought prevention work, it is necessary to constantly pay attention to the development of the drought situation and take measures as early as possible to prevent disasters before they happen.
    In view of the fact that the leading organs for flood control and drought relief at all levels were established late in the past, making work passive and even causing losses, all localities are required to establish institutions as soon as possible this year, study and determine the local flood control and drought relief plans, and quickly deploy them in combination with the central task of spring plowing production, and conduct inspections.
    In flood control, it is required that flood control organizations at all levels, regions, relevant departments, and local governments and river basin water conservancy institutions cooperate closely, clarify the division of labor. If there are problems between regions, both parties should actively negotiate and resolve them in the spirit of mutual assistance and concession and taking care of the overall situation, and report to the leading organs for record.
    This year is the second year of China's Five-Year Construction Plan. Overcoming water and drought disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest of agricultural products are of great significance to the country's socialist construction. It is hoped that people's governments at all levels, under the glorious light of the national general line, will mobilize and rely on the masses to strive for the victorious completion of the glorious task of flood control and drought relief in 1954.

    中央防汛总指挥部和中央生产防旱办公室
    关于一九五四年防汛防旱工作的指示
    几年来我国水利建设有很大发展，对保障农业生产起了一定的作用。但是由于消灭水旱灾害是个长期的斗争过程，为求得每年灾害有所减轻，除继续兴修水利工程以外，必须领导群众，充分运用已有的水利设施，加强防汛、防旱的斗争。
    一九五四年防汛、防旱的任务，是努力防止各大江河严重的决口改道，保障一般河流在保证水位下不溃堤并争取防御更大的洪水，同时要设法防止或缩小可能发生的旱灾与涝灾。
    为了做好今年的防汛防旱工作，各地除应继续贯彻政务院、中央防汛总指挥部及中央生产防旱办公室历年的指示外，特作如下指示：
  一、提高警惕，反对麻痹
    历年防汛防旱工作中的最大障碍是领导思想上的麻痹大意。有的认为已经作了许多工程，又积累了一些防汛防旱的经验，就觉得有恃无恐；有的见到一时的风调雨顺而盲目乐观，或认为洪水不一定年年发生，而麻痹大意；因而事先不作准备，汛期疏于防守，或旱象已成才仓卒应战，以致造成忙乱被动的现象，或竟发生不应有的灾害。为了肃清这些麻痹思想和侥幸心理，首先要求各地领导机关、领导干部提起注意，经常清醒地、深入地掌握本地区、本流域的实际情况，提高警惕，提高预见，反对麻痹，并反复地教育干部及群众，保证防汛防旱工作的贯彻执行。
    二、检修工程，保证质量，加强现有工程的管理运用
    从大江大河的堤防闸坝到农村中公有和私有的塘堰、水井、水车，都是防洪、防旱的物质力量，都必须进行普遍的检查和必要的整修，使之发挥最大的效益。去年汛期有不少塘坝工程不合标准，或缺少溢洪设备，致被洪水冲毁；有些涵洞发生漏水现象；也有个别防洪工程，因质量过低，或疏于检查，未到保证水位即行溃决。在工程管理方面，有些堤防平时缺乏管理，汛前检查不够，隐患依然存在；有些塘坝，由于管理不善，蓄水不足，用水浪费，以致旱象发生，水量缺乏，甚至引起争水纠纷。以上都应引为重要的教训。
    今年在大江大河的防汛方面，要求加强对已修工程的检查（特别是堤防的检查、锥探），保证工程质量，健全管理机构，并根据各种不同的洪水情况，上下游统筹考虑，订出管理操纵的适当措施。对预定的行洪、分洪、滞洪地区存在的问题，要及时加以解决。
    在一般河流方面，除检查巩固现有堤防外，对枯水流量与洪水流量极为悬殊的河流，应当特别加以注意，这些河流因为平常行水较少，河道堤防最易遭受天然与人为的破坏。对于河床中影响行洪排水的障碍，应及早设法清除。
    对灾害严重的河流，为了防御更大的洪水，有计划地缩小灾害，可以事前预筹分洪、滞洪、蓄洪的临时措施。但是必须经过实地调查，科学计算，由省以上的党政领导机关掌握批准，并订出补偿或救济的办法，向群众说明。这是临时措施能否实施的重要关键，必须加以注意。
    在经常遭受涝灾的地区，应将沟洫、涵闸等排水系统认真检查，并组织群众进行必要的整修。有些低洼地区排水无出路者，应征得群众同意，统筹蓄水和排水，以求缩小灾害。上下游的排水纠纷应及早注意解决。
    在防旱方面：南方水田防旱的主要关键是及时蓄水、防漏保水、以及合理用水三个环节。现在应发动群众普遍检查、整修各种蓄水设施，尽量引蓄雨水及河湖水；在易受干旱地区，应继续发掘引用各种可能的水源，修整并保护田埂，减少田间水量流失；对于分散性的小型塘堰，应积极领导受益群众商定管理养护公约，实行有组织的用水，节约水量。有条件地区可在重点试办的基础上适当发展机械排灌设备。
    北方各地，除仍普遍提倡耕耙保墒外，并应继续发展水井、水车及渠道灌溉，加强用水管理，推广浅灌、畦灌、沟灌等先进经验，反对大水漫灌，以扩大灌溉面积并防止土壤碱化。
    近年来，在山东、安徽等易涝易旱地区，试行沟洫、畦田、抬田等多种多样方法，分散蓄水，使防涝防旱相结合；或改种适宜作物，以减轻灾害。各地在山区推行水土保持，都曾收到一定成效。这些带有广泛群众性的农田山林的改良工作，是治理水旱灾害的根本措施之一，尤应注意在春季生产中进一步推广。
    正在施工中的基本建设工程，应及早做好防护准备，做到有备无患。同时应保证按期完成，使能及时发挥作用。
    三、掌握情况，提高预见，加强防汛、防旱、防涝工作的统筹结合
    我国气候在进入汛期以后，随时有发生暴雨的可能。在各河涨水的时候，往往同时发生内涝灾害；可是在这一时期各种农作物需水较多，一时雨量稍缺，又易发生旱象；所以先旱后涝、先涝后旱、或洪涝并至，几乎是各地都可能遇到的情况。因此防汛、防旱和防涝工作应密切结合进行，不可偏废。但是在部分地区防汛与防旱脱节的现象仍有发生，甚至有的地区在防旱时为了引水浇地而掘堤，或开放涵洞未予关闭，以致造成水灾；有的地区为了预防洪水，放空池塘，结果削弱了防旱能力；也有许多地区在防汛中只注意防守较大河道的堤防，对广大农田的排水防涝工作则缺乏领导。
    今年要求各地贯彻过去的指示，切实做到防汛、防旱、防涝的统筹结合。在防旱、抗旱工作中，即须注意到准备防汛，而在大水之后，又须注意到蓄水防旱。同时要根据当时当地的情况，分别主要、次要，掌握不同的重点。
    为了提高预见性，要加强洪水预报并尽可能扩大预报的范围。在受台风影响及经常发生山洪灾害的地区，要特别注意灾害性天气的预报，以求避免或减轻灾害。关于灾害性天气的预报，雨情、水情的测报与分析，及农业生产上防灾抗旱情况的报告，都应当结合研究，借以探索掌握降雨情况对农作物生长的关系，使科学的分析预报对当时当地防汛、防涝、防旱工作能发挥更多的指导作用。
    四、加强防汛、防旱的组织领导，密切各方面的联系
    依靠群众，总结并推广群众的经验，是战胜水旱灾害的主要保证。目前互助合作运动对发展农业生产起着推动的作用，依靠组织起来的力量，做好防汛、防旱工作，并解决防汛防旱与生产的矛盾，不但有利于互助合作运动的巩固与发展，同时亦可带动一般农民，加强水利设施，防止自然灾害。
    防汛防旱工作是贯穿春耕到秋收整个农业生产过程中的重要工作，要求各级领导机关经常予以高度注意，加强领导。在汛情或旱情紧张时，动员一切力量突击抢救是必要的。但经验证明，防汛防旱的胜利主要取决于经常的准备工作和及时的预防措施。在防汛中注意经常的养护防守，便可减少险情，并避免人力和物力的浪费。在防旱方面，由于旱灾是逐渐形成的，在成灾以前，最易失去警惕。因此，在防旱工作中尤须经常注意观察旱情的发展，及早采取措施，防害于未然。
    鉴于过去各级防汛防旱领导机构成立较晚，使工作被动，甚至遭受损失，今年要求各地及早成立机构，研究确定当地防汛防旱的计划，结合春耕生产的中心任务迅速布置下去，并加以检查。
    在防汛中，要求各级防汛组织间、各地区间、各有关部门间、地方政府与流域水利机构间密切配合，明确分工。地区与地区间存在的问题，双方都应积极协商，本互助互让、照顾整体的精神，加以解决。并报领导机关备查。
    今年是我国五年建设的第二年度，战胜水旱灾害，保障农产丰收，对国家社会主义建设，有着重大的意义，希望各级人民政府在国家总路线的光辉照耀下，发动与依靠群众，为胜利完成一九五四年防汛防旱的光荣任务而奋斗。
