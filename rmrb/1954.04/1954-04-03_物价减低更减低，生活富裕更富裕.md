Prices Reduced Further, Living Standards Become More Prosperous
By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

The news of price reductions in the Soviet Union, carried by the spring breeze, spread from Moscow throughout the entire Soviet Union on the night of March 31st. Sometimes spring is late in arriving, but the Soviet Union's annual price reductions begin unfailingly on April 1st. People are as certain that spring will arrive as they are that prices will be reduced. Today, people's certainty has become a reality. Stores in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union are crowded with customers with extremely high purchasing power. They are buying more daily necessities with the same amount of rubles as before. This is the seventh time the Soviet Union has reduced prices since 1947. This shows that reducing prices is not a temporary measure in the Soviet Union, but a firm and unwavering policy consistently implemented by the Soviet Communist Party and the government. This also shows that meeting the material and cultural needs of the people as much as possible is an important item in the program of communist construction.

The Soviet Union's past six price reductions (from 1947 to 1953) reduced the price of bread, macaroni, rice, meat and animal oils by about two-thirds, the price of potatoes and vegetables by more than two-thirds, and the price of sugar by more than half; the prices of all daily necessities were reduced by 55 percent. As a result of price reductions alone, the income of Soviet workers and collective farmers in 1953 was 60 percent higher than in 1949. Their purchasing power also increased with their income. In 1953, they purchased 5.3 times more woolen cloth and silk than in 1940, and 2.1 times more clothing than in 1940. In 1953, the retail sales of goods in the Soviet Union increased by 21 percent compared to 1952. The reduction in prices allows people with constantly increasing purchasing power to be even more satisfied. The daily necessities that have been reduced in price this time are extensive, among which the most noteworthy are grains, textiles, and clothing. The prices of bread, flour, and macaroni have been reduced by 5 to 15 percent; the price of textiles has been reduced by 10 to 20 percent; the prices of clothes and shoes have been reduced by 7 to 25 percent. This price reduction will benefit the Soviet people 20 billion rubles annually through state-owned and cooperative trade alone. The annual and extensive reduction of prices is only possible by relying on labor enthusiasm and continuously increasing production on the basis of advanced technology. In 1953, the Soviet Union's industrial output exceeded pre-war levels by one and a half times, with heavy industrial output exceeding two times. As a result of adopting a vigorous development policy, the value of Soviet consumer goods produced in the second half of 1953 increased by more than 30 billion rubles compared to the first half of the year. In that year, about 300 newly built consumer goods factories were put into production. Many heavy industrial enterprises have designated departments to produce consumer goods. In 1953, the Soviet Union's grain harvest reached approximately 8 billion poods. These are the foundations for the Soviet Union's seventh price reduction. The Soviet Union is now vigorously developing agriculture and the consumer goods industry. In the next few years, the amount of grain purchased and acquired by the Soviet state will increase by 35 to 40 percent compared to 1953. The Soviet Union will produce abundant varieties of agricultural and livestock products. The Soviet Union's investment in the consumer goods industry this year is nearly 6 billion rubles, about twice as much as last year. A large number of consumer goods factories are being built and expanded. All Soviet industrial and agricultural laborers are working hard to greatly increase production. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union's future prices will be reduced further and further, and the lives of the builders of communist society will become more and more prosperous.

### 物价减低更减低，生活富裕更富裕

    物价减低更减低，生活富裕更富裕
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联减低物价的消息，随着春风，在三月三十一日夜晚由莫斯科传遍了全苏联。一年一度的春天有时会迟到人间，苏联每年减低物价却不差一天地在四月一日开始了。人们像确信春天会到来一样确信物价会减低。今天，人们的确信成为事实了。在莫斯科和全苏联的各个商店拥挤着购买力极高的顾客。他们以和往常同样多的卢布，购买着更多的日用必需品。这是苏联从一九四七年以来第七次减低物价。这说明，减低物价在苏联不是什么临时性的措施，而是苏联共产党和政府所一贯实行的确定不移的政策。这也说明，尽量满足人民的物质和文化的需要，是共产主义建设纲领中的重要项目。
    苏联过去的六次减低物价（从一九四七年到一九五三年），使面包、通心粉、米粮、肉类和动物油的价格减低约三分之二，马铃薯和蔬菜的价格减低三分之二以上，糖的价格减低一半以上；所有日用必需品价格减低百分之五十五。仅仅由于减低物价，苏联职工和集体农民的收入，在一九五三年比一九四九年就提高了百分之六十。他们的购买力也随着收入而提高着。他们在一九五三年购买的毛布和丝绸为一九四○年的五点三倍，购买的衣服为一九四○年的二点一倍。一九五三年苏联零售的商品比一九五二年增加了百分之二十一。物价的减低，使购买力不断提高的人们得到更大的满足。这次减价的日用必需品很广，其中最值得注意的是谷物、纺织品和衣着。面包、麦粉、通心粉减价百分之五到十五；纺织品减价百分之十到二十；衣服鞋帽减价百分之七到二十五。这次减低物价，使苏联人民仅仅经过国营和合作社经营的贸易等一年就将得益二百亿卢布。一年一度广泛地减低物价，这只有依靠劳动热情，在高度技术的基础上，不断提高生产，才有可能。苏联在一九五三年的工业产量超过战前一倍半，其中重工业产量超过两倍。由于采取大力发展方针，苏联在一九五三年下半年的日用品产值比上半年增加了三百多亿卢布。这一年有约三百座新建的日用品工厂投入生产。许多重工业企业划出部门来生产日用品。一九五三年苏联谷物收获量约达八十亿普特。这些就是苏联第七次减低物价的基础。苏联现在大力发展农业和日用品工业，在最近几年内苏联国家征购和收购的谷物将比一九五三年增加百分之三十五到四十，苏联将生产丰富的各种农产品和畜产品。苏联今年在日用品工业上的投资，近六十亿卢布，约为去年的两倍。大批日用品工厂在建设和扩大着。全苏联工农业劳动者为大大增产而努力着。苏联将来的物价还会减低再减低，共产主义社会建设者的生活还会富裕更富裕，这是无疑的。
