Many friends wrote to ask: How are the heroes building roads on the Kangzang Plateau living? The lines are filled with concern and love for them. What should I say?

The Kangzang area has vast fertile land and densely forested river valleys, and building it is indeed arduous. But the comrades who have experienced countless battles work so optimistically and happily.

It was October 1952 when soldiers of a certain unit went to repair a dangerous section of the road. To reach the destination, they had to cross three mountains, each higher than the last (each mountain being about forty li high). When the comrades climbed to the third mountain, there were still five li to the summit, and the sun had already set. At this time, everyone was thirsty and hungry, sweating with every two steps, and the sweat turned to ice as soon as they stopped, chilling them to the bone. Comrades with snow blindness could only walk with tinted glasses. Standing up, cold, hunger, thirst, and fatigue all struck at once, and black circles appeared before their eyes. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Comrades, cheer up! March towards Lhasa! The commander and political commissar are still insisting on climbing the mountain. Who is a hero? See you at the top!" Looking back, it was Sergeant Deng. He was climbing with everyone. At first, he said some humorous things, but later he stopped speaking, and the sweat on his face was like beans. The comrades thought he was sick and surrounded him, asking: What's wrong? He took a few breaths and, after his heart beat more calmly, said, "You climb! I can catch up."

The regimental political commissar, with a twenty-jin bag of rice on his shoulder, also arrived. Following him, another leader who had been through the Long March came. He looked at it and said, "Sergeant Deng, give me a big bag of rice." Sergeant Deng saw that the leaders were all there, and if he stopped again, they would definitely抢着代 him to carry his things, so he smiled and climbed up with difficulty. The photographer stopped him ahead—put down his backpack and insisted on taking a photo. As they continued to advance, Comrade Qi Fazhi, the squad leader, fainted. The howling mountain wind swept snowflakes like碎银碎银, rushing towards people's hands and faces. Two comrades immediately put down the tent and carried Qi Fazhi on their backs. In this way, everyone encouraged each other, cared for each other, and climbed to the top of the mountain.

As soon as the clouds gathered on the mountaintop, the weather changed again: rain mixed with snowballs and hail fell. The ocean of mountains suddenly became so evil, heavy, and terrifying! Clothes were soaked through. But the comrades' energy did not diminish, some pulled people to sing, some shouted slogans.

It was already after nine o'clock when they arrived at the residence. The comrades camped on the hillside, each eating a large bowl of half-cooked rice. The tent also leaked, and the quilt was still wet when they woke up in the morning. The comrades who had fallen behind either came overnight or camped on the mountain. When they rolled up their tents the next day, someone ran over and said that a person was buried in the snow nearby. The soldiers rushed to拨开 the snow and took a look, it was the bugler of the Second Battalion, with his backpack still strapped to his body, his clothes almost frozen into a ball. His lips were blue, and when they unbuttoned his coat and felt him, his heart was still beating slightly. After giving him hot soup and an injection, they warmed him up. He immediately cheered up and said, "The clerk brought me here, said he was going to find a residence, and told me to stay in this tent. I thought I could go to the residence and take a rest, who knew I fell asleep as soon as I sat down." The comrades carried him for more than twenty li, and he refused to be carried any longer. He smiled and walked with everyone.

Labor is happiness and joy! Yes, to labor for the permanent happiness of mankind, for the magnificent cause of communism, and even to dedicate one's youth and life, is unparalleled happiness and joy! Let me give you another example.

In March of last year, the troops entered the Mila Mountain work area and had to open a road on the mountainside—one thousand meters from the foot of the mountain. Here, there were overhanging cliffs above and deep valleys and the turbulent Jinsha River below. Every day from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm,狂风大作。

After half a month of engineering progress, there were even more difficulties. Those digging earth had their shoulders pressed red and swollen; those opening rocks had blood blisters on their hands. People put cotton wads on their shoulders, wrapped their hands with cloth, gritted their teeth and endured the pain, and still maintained a speed of five to seven trips per minute within ten meters; when the soles of their shoes wore through, they wrapped them with rags. Every morning at six o'clock, people braved the cold wind, carrying tools, carrying pots, carrying water, and carrying heavy wood,昂然 climbed up the mountain. At lunchtime, you could see: people who were reading the wall newspaper would suddenly have their mouths blocked by the wind; white rice would suddenly be covered with a layer of yellow sand. But they often wiped their eyes and continued to read and continued to eat. This requires so much perseverance and willpower! When they passed by the kitchen and saw that the firewood was used up, they knew: tomorrow is Sunday again! For the road builders, Sunday is a real "labor day": the mildly ill are responsible for washing clothes and晒被子, and the other partners, some go to cut firewood, some go to carry rice and transport tools. If they don't do this, they will lose the most basic material guarantee, and they will be forced to stop work next week!

When you walk to their construction site, the scene there will make you悚然心惊. On that steep峰楞, dozens of people were tied to the hanging cliffs in the clouds, prying rocks and打锤, with the turbid and rushing Jinsha River far below their feet, and 怪石 about to fall above their heads.

It was here that many heroic deeds appeared:

One day, the soldier Li Wenhua—a capable, handsome, and lovable young man—was prying rocks in mid-air when suddenly the ground shook and a huge rock fell, breaking two of the three ropes tied to him; when he dodged the rock, his body flashed, and the steel撬石 "dang!" flew down the deep valley, he swayed a few times, the last rope was broken, and he fell down. The comrades rushed down the mountain and found him. He had several head injuries, several body injuries, and five teeth knocked out. They felt him, and he was still breathing, so the comrades sent him to the hospital. A week later, he resumed his work.

The comrades also had to fight against the harsh climate of the plateau.

Que'er Mountain in July was shockingly cold, while the Nujiang was dry and闷热.

The comrades had to dig a road in a place where the sand was flowing. The wind rolled up the gray sand,钻 straight into their eyes and mouths. Wearing goggles was烫得令人难受; wearing a mask was闷得 出不来气. The sand and soil were scorching to the touch and they could not wear the rubber shoes. Eyelashes and ears were filled with soil, and sweat mixed with soil became mud sweat. Digging out a shovel of soil, the wind would blow back half of it. But you couldn't find a trace of bitterness on their faces. As soon as the work signal was blown, they ran to the river to wash their faces, drank thin porridge, and went to play ball, rehearse programs, and learn culture. As soon as it dawned, they carried their tools and marched雄赳赳 to work.

The heroes not only had to open "iron mountains" but also conquer "ice rivers."

It was an early morning in October, and the frost froze into碎冰, and the rushing river flowed with ice. Dozens of bridge builders came to the river. They took off their皮大衣, felt boots, 皮袄, leather pants, 皮帽子, and jumped into the deep water one after another. They shouted, talked and laughed... but after a while, their laughter became lower, because their jawbones were打得 tighter and louder, and their trembling bodies gradually became numb. The regimental political commissar, squatting on the shore with a watch, had beads of sweat on his forehead. He wanted to say something to them, but he couldn't say anything—what words in the world could describe the hearts of the heroes? Just then, the loudspeaker broadcast the children's voices:

"Dear uncles! We can study quietly in the warm embrace of the motherland, and this is inseparable from you! Although we are thousands of miles away and cannot see you, your life, work, and study are what we are most concerned about. Uncles! These are not only the words in our hearts, but also the words that children all over the country want to say, and the words that people all over the country want to say!"

"We must build the bridge well!" They responded excitedly. Communist Party member Ma Xueqing dived into the bottom of the water, and when he returned to the shore, he lost consciousness. The first thing he said when he woke up was "The bridge—is the bridge built?"

Dear readers, I won't say more. Let us always remember the heroes who dedicate their youth and their lives in the most desolate places. Let their beautiful thoughts always be buried deep in our hearts, take root, blossom, and bear fruit.

    把幸福带给康藏人民的英雄们
    赵先前
    很多朋友来信问：在康藏高原筑路的英雄们生活得怎样？字里行间充满着对他们的关切和热爱。我该怎么说呢？
    康藏地区有着辽阔的沃土和森林茂密的川谷，建设它，确是艰苦的。但经历过无数次战斗的同志们却工作得那么乐观、快活。
    那是一九五二年十月，某部战士去抢修某处险工。要到达目的地，必须翻过三个一个比一个高的大山头（每个山高约四十华里）。当同志们爬到第三个山头，离山顶还有五华里的时候，太阳已经落山了。这时，大家肚里又渴又饿，走两步就出汗，稍一停汗水便变成冰，冷的心颤。得雪盲的同志，只能戴着有色镜走路。一站起来，冷、饥、渴、累一齐袭来，眼前直出黑圈。忽然，有人传出：“同志们加油啊！向拉萨进军，首长、政委还坚持爬山哩。谁是英雄好汉，山头见！”回头一看，原来是邓上士。他和大家一块爬着。开始他还说些幽默话，以后就不吭声了，脸上的汗珠像豆粒子似的。同志们以为他得了什么病，都围着看他，问：怎么啦？他喘了几口气，待心跳得平静些以后，说道：“您爬吧！我可以赶上。”
    团政委肩上搭着一只二十来斤重的米袋子，也赶到了。跟着，经过长征的另一位首长也来啦，他看了看说道：“邓上士，拣一个大米袋子给我。”邓上士看首长们都在，再停下来，他带的东西一定会被他们抢着代他背的，便笑呵呵地艰难地向上爬。摄影员在头里拦住——把背包一放，硬要摄个影。当他们继续前进时，班长齐法志同志昏倒了。呼啸的山风，飞卷着碎银似的雪片，扑向人们的手和脸。两个同志马上放下帐篷，背起了齐法志。大家就这样互相鼓励着，互相关照着，爬上了山头。
    山头上云雾一集，天又变了：夹着雪团、冰雹的雨，降下来了。一片山的海洋，刹时变得这样阴恶，沉重和可怖！衣物淋透了。但同志们的劲儿并没有减低，有的拉人唱歌，有的喊口号。
    赶到住地时已九点多。同志们宿营在山坡上，每人吃了一缸子半生的饭。帐篷又漏水，睡到天明被子还是潮湿的。掉队的同志，有连夜赶来的，也有在山上宿营的。第二天卷起帐篷要走时，有人跑来说，附近雪里埋着一个人。战士们急忙跑去拨开雪一瞧，是二营司号员，背包还拴在身上，衣物快冻成一团了。他嘴唇发青，解开他的上衣摸摸，心脏还微微地跳动着。给他灌了热汤，打了针，才把他暖过来。他马上就抖擞精神地说：“文书带我到这里，说去找住地，叫我在这帐篷里待着。我想可到住地啦，歇了一歇，谁知一坐就睡着了。”同志们抬他走了二十多里，他怎么也不让抬了。他笑呵呵地和大家一起走起来。
    劳动是幸福、愉快的呀！是的，为人类的永久幸福，为壮丽的共产主义事业而劳动，以至献出自己的青春和生命，就是无比的幸福，无比的愉快！让我再举个例子吧。
    去年三月间，部队进入米拉山工区，要在山腰——离山脚一千公尺的地方开出路来。这里，上临悬岩，下临深谷和湍急的金沙江。每天上午八时至下午四时，狂风大作。
    当工程进展半月之后，困难更多了。挖土方的，肩部已压得红肿起来；开石方的，手上起了血泡。人们在肩头上垫着棉团，用布缠着手，咬牙忍住疼痛，在十公尺内每分钟仍然保持五到七趟的运速；鞋底磨穿了，就缠上烂布。每当早晨六点钟，人们就冒着寒风，扛着工具，背着锅，抬着水以及笨重的木料，昂然地爬上山去。午饭时，你可以看到：正念着墙报的人，会突然被风堵住嘴；白白的米饭，会突然蒙上一层黄沙。但他们往往揩揩眼，又继续念，继续吃下去。这需要多大的坚韧和毅力啊！当他们经过伙房看到柴火用完了，他们就知道：明天又是星期日啦！对筑路的人们，星期日是个实实在在的“劳动日”：轻病号要负责洗衣服晒被子，其余的伙伴，有的去砍柴，有的去背米、运工具。不这样，就要失掉最起码的物质保证，下周就会被迫停工！
    当你走上他们的工地，那里的景象会使你悚然心惊。在那笔陡的峰楞上，几十个人在云烟中系在悬岩上撬石、打锤，脚下远处是浑黄奔腾的金沙江，脑袋上面是作欲坠状的怪石。
    就在这里，出现了许多的英雄事迹：
    有一天，战士李文化——一个能干、漂亮、惹人喜爱的小伙子，正悬空撬石，突然一阵地动，坠下块巨石，把系在他身上的三股绳砸断了两股；他躲开石头时身子一闪，撬石的钢钎“当！”的一声飞下了深谷，他连晃了几下，最后一股绳被折断了，他就跌下去了。同志们急忙奔下山找到了他。他头部摔伤了几处，身上碰伤几块，牙齿掉了五个。摸摸他，还有气，同志们把他送到医院。一周之后，他又恢复了工作。
    同志们还要和高原地区恶劣的气候作斗争。
    七月间的雀儿山，冷得惊人，而在怒江，却是干旱、闷热。
    同志们要在一处淌沙的地方挖出路来。风卷着灰沙，直往眼里、嘴里钻。戴上风镜，烫得令人难受；戴上口罩，闷得出不来气。沙土被晒得灼人，无法穿那胶制的鞋子。睫毛上、耳朵里是土，汗和土混起来，成了泥汗。挖出一锹土，风又给你刮回来一半。但在他们脸上你找不到一丝苦丧的影子。下工号一吹，他们跑到江边洗洗脸，喝过稀饭，就去打球，排演节目，学文化。天一亮，他们又扛着工具雄赳赳地上工了。
    英雄们不但要开“铁山”，还要征服“冰河”。
    那是十月间的一个早晨，霜冻成了碎冰，急湍的河水，带着冰块奔流着。几十个架桥的人来到了河边。他们脱去皮大衣、毡靴、皮袄、皮裤、皮帽子，一个接一个地跳进了深水。他们呼喊着：说笑着……但一会之后，他们的说笑声低下来了，原来他们的下巴骨打得更紧促、更响了，他们颤抖的身躯渐渐麻木了。拿着表蹲在岸上的团政委，额上冒出了汗粒，他想对他们说些什么，但什么话也说不出来——世界上有什么话能道出英雄们的心地呢？就在这时，扩音器传出了孩子的声音：
    “亲爱的叔叔！我们能在祖国温暖的怀抱里安静地学习，这是和你们分不开的！我们虽然远隔着几千里路，看不见你们，但你们的生活、工作与学习，是我们最挂念着的。叔叔！这不只是我们心里的话，也是全国小朋友要说的话，全国人民要说的话！”
    “我们一定要把桥修好！”他们激动地呼应着。共产党员马学清，一头钻进水底，当他回到岸上时，失去了知觉，他醒过来头句话就是“桥——桥架好了没有？”
    亲爱的读者们，我不再多说了。让我们永远记住在最荒寒的地方献出自己的青春，献出自己的生命的英雄们。让他们的美丽的思想，永远埋在我们心灵的深处，生根，开花，结果吧。
