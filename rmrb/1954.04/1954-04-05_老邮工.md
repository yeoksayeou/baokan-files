    Old Postal Worker
  　Zǐ Gāng
    One day in January of this year, Hu Yanling, the train receiver at Tumu Station Post Office, suddenly received a call from the section director of the Guanting Reservoir Post Office. The phone was in the transfer station of the Engineering Bureau next to the station. Although Old Hu's small earthen house was right next to the transfer station, he was already panting when he ran to the transfer station office.
   "Old Hu, be careful not to fall, what's the rush!" Director Jia of the transfer station was familiar with Old Hu and his work, and had always admired the old man for the hard work he put into the Guanting Reservoir mail. He could see that the 55-year-old Hu's steps were getting more and more unsteady each year. He was fat, with a round head and a pair of round, honest eyes.
   "Can I not hurry? I'm afraid of missing the next train." Old Hu picked up the headset: "Director Duan? This is Old Hu speaking—"
    "Congratulations, old pal!" Old Hu seemed to see Director Duan's young smiling face through the headset. This young man who had been a military postal worker in the Liberated Areas was always amiable, without the airs of those directors Old Hu had seen before liberation. Director Jia, who was standing nearby, knew about his family affairs and figured it was probably his new wife, whom he had married a couple of years ago, arguing with his son from his previous marriage again. Director Jia watched the receiver, trying to read what the good news was from Old Hu's next expression.
    Old Hu's face suddenly turned red, and he asked directly into the phone: "What? What?"
    "You've been selected as a model worker for the Zhangjiakou Special District, a mo—del worker."
    The last two words were even heard by Director Jia, who was standing next to him. He saw the person on the phone sway a little, like a drunk person. The other party was still instructing: "Hey, hey, prepare to leave for Zhangjiakou the day after tomorrow for the meeting—the model worker conference. I'll have Xiao Wang fill in for you."
    Old Hu's ears suddenly went deaf, and in the end, Director Jia helped him understand everything clearly. Director Duan said that this conference would have more than ninety model workers from various departments on the production front in the Zhangjiakou Special District attending.
    "Let go, comrades, train No. 108 is arriving soon." If Old Hu hadn't struggled, the people in the office would have thrown this hundred-plus-pound fat old man up to the ceiling to celebrate. Old Hu barely found this excuse to dash out the door. His steps were much lighter, and the people in the office smiled as they watched his back. Someone was saying: This model worker evaluation is right. Old Hu receives trains 365 days a year. Last year, when work was busy, the letters, newspapers, and packages for Guanting Reservoir weighed hundreds of pounds per train. He carried them back and forth, and the old man never missed a trip! If the train receiver at the neighboring station missed receiving a train, the postal train would hand over the missed mail to Old Hu at the next station, and he would then hand it over to the postal train going in the opposite direction. However, to avoid delays, Old Hu often took the next train without a postal car during his free time to deliver the mail. For these things, he often received thanks and praise.
    Hu Yanling returned to his small house, grabbed a few mailbags, and ran to the station. His wife was stitching soles for shoes, sitting on the kang and constantly asking: "What did the phone say?" His son was looking at him from the side, as if asking with his eyes.
    Old Hu took a few steps, then lifted the curtain and stepped in with one leg:
    "I'm telling you, Old Hu has become a model worker!—See if you two are ever going to finish fighting!"
    The train from the west wasn't arriving for a while, the bell hadn't rung yet. Old Hu carried a few light mailbags and walked to the side of the railway. Today, he wanted to stand alone in the cold wind and think about what this was all about. "Model worker" was a new term brought about after liberation, constantly on people's lips and in the newspapers. He knew that it referred to people who had created new methods and achieved new results in their work. When Old Hu was at Huailai Post Office, he also participated in model worker selection meetings, and he had also received two minor merits and became an advanced worker, but he never thought that he would become a model worker himself. The comrades at Guanting Post Office had mentioned that one day they would select him as a model worker, but he shook his head and said: "A train receiver doesn't make much of a contribution!"
    Hu Yanling fastened his fur hat and looked at the rows of young people in blue cotton uniforms next to the red brick station. They were laughing, singing, and talking, and some were even throwing basketballs. Old Hu guessed: These were students from some school in Beijing who had come to visit Guanting Reservoir and had played a game with the workers there, and were now waiting for the train to go back. He suddenly remembered: Although he had become a model worker from Guanting Post Office, he had only been to Guanting once in the year and a half since he was transferred there. At that time, the project was far from complete. He had attended a meeting at the post office and then returned in a hurry. Director Duan had roughly explained the flood control and water diversion functions of the dam, spillway, and aqueduct, but he didn't quite understand what was going on, so he had returned to his post and kept to his duties. He clearly understood the construction site slogan of "fighting floods and racing against time." Tumu Station was a distribution center for Guanting Reservoir workers and materials, and also a distribution center for mail. When the project was in full swing before last year's flood season, there were more than 40,000 workers. Old Hu felt that his diligence and timely mail receiving were beneficial to the Engineering Bureau's allocation of materials and to the workers' contact with their hometowns. Sometimes, receiving a train required carrying nearly a thousand pounds of mailbags. He revved up like a car engine, forgetting fatigue and sleepiness. During the year and a half, he had to receive mail from four trains day and night, but he never missed a trip. He also never missed receiving mail from cars. At most, the newspapers delivered to the construction site every day weighed eighty or ninety pounds.
    "This is Old Hu fighting floods and racing against time!" He always said this to the people at Guanting Post Office and to the people at the transfer station. Now he suddenly wanted to tell those who came from hundreds of miles away to visit the reservoir project, and to tell them that he was a person who grew up by the Lugou Bridge and deeply knew how harmful floods were, and deeply knew how terrible the Yongding River was when it flooded. He, Old Hu, was also paying attention to the reservoir project and was happy for its upcoming completion. He hadn't gone to see the reservoir up close, not because he didn't love the reservoir, but because he couldn't spare the time. These mails, the endless back and forth of mails, had firmly nailed him to the Tumu Station.
    The train "woo woo"ed in the west, and smoke was scattered in the sky, and the rails were faintly vibrating. Old Hu fastened the buttons of his winter work clothes—a fur coat—and stood in the old place where the postal car of this train stopped.
    The train clanked, the small door of the postal car opened, and the postal worker inside saw Old Hu as soon as the door opened, as accurately as tearing off a calendar. His shoulders and sides were full of mailbags. If it happened to be a snowy day, he was covered in snowflakes from head to toe, truly like a snow-covered Buddha coming to the silver-white station.
      "Not delayed, eh!"
     "Can't be delayed!"
    Up and down the mailbags were exchanged in such formulaic conversations, and the lists recording the number of mails up and down were also quickly exchanged.
      "Xiao Zhang, is it cold in Zhangjiakou these days?"
    Unable to figure out what Old Hu was getting at, Xiao Zhang replied faintly: "Much colder than Beijing! About the same as your Tumu. Why? Going?"
      "Nothing, nothing, just asking!"
    Before closing the car door, Xiao Zhang didn't forget to toss down a small package, four taels of tea bought for Old Hu. Everyone knew that Old Hu lived at this remote village-like station, so they were happy to buy him some small necessities. Although this station had not been a remote village for the past two years, with thousands of passengers getting on and off, and machines, cement, steel bars, dump trucks, wood, coal... for Guanting Reservoir also being unloaded in trains; migrant workers pouring in from Zhangjiakou, Tongxian, and Baoding three special districts; however, this was still just a transfer station for Guanting Reservoir and had not formed a market town.
    Old Hu had just walked to the door of his half-room house when a guard comrade from the transfer station reached out and sent over two eggs: "Comrade Old Hu: Since you've become a model worker, even the chickens in your house are hurrying to lay eggs to congratulate you!" This young man gave Old Hu a smiling salute. He often picked up eggs for Old Hu.
    "What's all this about? I'm worried about receiving the trains here. I haven't even been to a meeting with a lot of people, sigh—" With a face of three parts worry and seven parts joy, he went into the house to sort the mail.
    The dispute between his wife and his son from his previous marriage seemed to have eased somewhat because of the good news of his being selected as a model worker. The matter wasn't serious in the first place, it was about the son's employment. The son had fallen off several jobs because of his poor performance. The stepmother interpreted this as him being useless, while the son said it was an accidental mistake or someone else's misunderstanding.
   "Your dad's a model worker, a son in his twenties can't just stay at home watching the pot." The son was still unwilling to retort to this sentence, he also knew the meaning of "model worker" in the new society. When his father was checking the newspapers, the son said softly:
   "Dad, I'm going to Fengtai tomorrow." This didn't surprise Old Hu, because there was such a plan. Someone had introduced a job in Fengtai to his son, and the son had been picky and hadn't made up his mind whether to go or not. This time, he felt that he couldn't be embarrassed to not learn from his model worker dad any longer.
    Dad didn't say anything, for fear of getting confused and sorting the mail wrong. He left the mail to be delivered near Tumu, and immediately moved the mail to be taken to Guanting outside to load onto the car. He also made a phone call to Director Duan, asking Xiao Wang to bring a post office clock, because his own clock, which he had bought when he started carrying mailbags at the station and had used for twenty-six years, was going to be repaired again. Also, he hoped that Xiao Wang would come on the early train tomorrow, because he had many, many things to explain.
    The woman was happy and couldn't close her mouth as she packed Old Hu's luggage, picking out the best clothes to pack, and Old Hu was also happy: "What kind of people will I meet? An old model worker in his fifties should give people an impression that he's not too old, I can still receive trains for twenty years."
    At one forty-six in the morning, he had to receive train No. 212 from Datong to Beijing. Usually, Old Hu could sleep for a while before this, but today he couldn't calm down no matter what. He had been a postal worker for twenty-six years, starting as a porter carrying mailbags at a large station. After the July 7th Incident, he was a rural postman in southern Beijing, and he often heard the villagers talk about the Eighth Route Army fighting the Japanese devils, and how the Eighth Route Army took care of the farmers. Old Hu's heart gradually brightened: So there are good people in the world. After that, in Fengtai, Nankou, Kangzhuang, Huailai, and Tumu, Old Hu lonely received trains at the station, guarding the mailbags for half his life. The Japanese devils, puppet troops, and Kuomintang bandits made him tighten his belt year after year, and no one looked up to this small character. Only after liberation, his hard work and achievements were recognized. In the post office, it used to be whatever the director said was what, and a train receiver like him would die of exhaustion without getting any credit; but now, "everyone is equal, and everyone can criticize each other if there's something wrong." Old Hu was most satisfied with this point.
    He was most worried about speaking at the meeting. Director Jia had already roughly told him how a general model worker conference was held, listening to reports, group discussions, speaking, exchanging experiences... and also visiting factories and mines, watching plays and movies.
    "What experience do I have?" At night, before receiving the night train, Old Hu lay in bed touching his chest and drafting a speech: "Not afraid of wind, not afraid of rain, that's all! During the day, I think: This is the mail for Guanting Reservoir! At night, I also think, this is the mail for Guanting Reservoir! Can mail control floods? I, Hu Yanling, say it can! I'm afraid of sleeping through the two trains at night, so I tighten the alarm spring, and then the alarm clock rings ten minutes early. In fact, old people don't sleep much, and it's become a habit, so I wake up on my own. In 1953, I moved more than 70,000 kilograms of mail, 534,000 letters, and 228,000 newspapers... These numbers aren't much. Compared to the manpower, materials, and financial resources used to build the reservoir, it's really not even a small fraction.
      "People might ask: You're an old man, fat and sloppy, aren't you tired? I say, it's a lie to say I'm not tired, but as long as I think: These mails are related to the supply of engineering materials, related to the clothing and supplies of tens of thousands of workers, related to their contact with the outside world, and related to their contact with their families, I grit my teeth and take quick steps, and carrying more than a hundred pounds on my shoulders at a time isn't anything. When it rains, I first cover the mailbags with rain cloths and carry them out and back; when it's cloudy, the three of us, mother and son, hide the mailbags in the half-room, and the kang is piled up like a small mountain, and people can't turn around..."
    He also thought: He shouldn't just talk about his own work, the dozen or so comrades at Guanting Post Office are all tired enough, in addition to being responsible for the rural mail in the fifth and sixth districts and the mountainous areas, there is also the postal service on the newly built railway line and the postal service for the reservoir. "Just last year alone, the amount of remittances and insured letters cashed out by Guanting Post Office was 13 billion yuan. In April, May, and June, there were the most migrant workers. If there are often 40,000 migrant workers, this number is even more staggering! I must tell the other ninety model workers in all walks of life how our Director Duan built the world alone when the reservoir first started, and how other comrades went to the workers' dormitories in the middle of the night to collect remittances and serve the workers who worked three shifts a day when there were many workers. And also, when the flood damaged the road last year, how the people at Guanting Post Office carried mail back and forth to Tumu, walking seventy or eighty li a day, other people's hard work must also be made known to everyone..." It was one thirty, Old Hu put on his clothes, picked up a kerosene lamp and walked out, preparing to receive train No. 212 from Datong to Beijing. He was carrying the alarm clock, which was older than his son, in his arms, wanting to ask the comrade on the postal train to take it to Beijing to be repaired. Although the shop said that this clock was too old and difficult to repair well, Old Hu didn't believe it. He thought: "Can't you find a trick to repair the clock and overcome the difficulties?" The postal workers on this train had already heard that Old Hu was going to Zhangjiakou to attend the labor model conference, and they knew that many heroic figures from the production front would attend this conference. The young postal worker, who was throwing mailbags as if he were throwing balls, said enviously to Old Hu: "Great, old pal, they're all from factories, rural areas, mines, railways... you, a train receiver, one of the 120,000 postal and telecommunications workers in the country, can also become a model worker, really not bad!"
    Old Hu's round, honest eyes smiled like a child's, and he was holding a mobile library box that had just been mailed, and he said hoarsely:
  "This is called every trade produces its master. I owe it to Chairman Mao and the Guanting Reservoir!" He handed the alarm clock to the other party. "Sorry to trouble you, it needs to be repaired again, it's not running on time." The young man smiled and said: "It's that again, you should buy a new one. Comrade Old Hu, your eyes are full of stations and trains, and mailbags and newspaper rolls, all day long. This time, open your eyes. Listen to the speeches of the leaders, it must be related to the general line, and maybe you can bring back a shiny medal, a big photo of Chairman Mao..." The young man's voice was drowned out by the sound of the train leaving, and the board door of the postal car slowly closed. His kind smiling face was like a spring breeze blowing into Old Hu's heart, and the old man's steps lifted lighter. He was still holding his right hand like a trumpet, shouting: "Don't forget to repair my clock, pick a good craftsman..." He turned back to his small house, preparing to take a nap, and then receive the train from Beijing to Datong at five o'clock in the morning.

    老邮工
  　子冈
    今年一月里的一天，土木车站的邮局接车员胡延龄忽然接到官厅水库邮局段局长一个电话，电话机在车站边工程局的转运站里。虽说老胡的半间小土房就在转运站旁边，老胡跑到转运站办公室的时候，已经是气喘吁吁的了。
   “老胡，小心别栽倒啊，慌张什么！”转运站贾主任熟悉老胡和他的工作情况，一向为了他对官厅水库的邮件所付出的辛劳而热爱着这老年人。眼瞅着这五十五岁的老胡的步子一年比一年蹒跚了。人胖，头也圆圆的，脸上还有一双圆圆的忠实的眼睛。
   “不快还行？怕误了接下一趟车啊。”老胡摘起耳机来：“段局长吗？我老胡哪——”
    “给你道喜啦，老伙计！”老胡仿佛从耳机子里看到了段局长年轻的笑脸，这个在解放区当过军邮员的年轻人一向和和气气，没有老胡在解放前所看见过的那些局长们的架子。
   “什么喜呀，我这几天心里正不痛快着呢！”爽直的老胡从不瞒人，他对这个共产党员段国善心服口服更是有话就说。在一边的贾主任清楚他那档子家事，该又是他前两年新娶的妻子和他的前房儿子吵架了。贾主任望着听筒，想从老胡下一步表情里看出是什么喜事。
    老胡的脸猛然红了，向电话机直问：“什么？什么？”
    “你当了张家口专区的模范了，模——范。”
    末了两个字连在一旁的贾主任都听到了，他瞧着这接电话的人的身子有些摇晃了，像一个喝醉了的人一样。对方还在嘱咐：“喂喂，你准备后天动身去张家口开会——劳模大会，我叫小王来代你的工作。”
    老胡的耳朵忽然发背，最后还是贾主任代听了个明明白白。段局长说，这次大会一共要有张家口专区生产战线上各部门的九十多位模范出席。
    “快松手，同志们，一○八次车快到了。”若不是老胡挣扎，办公室里的人一定会把这一百多斤重的胖老头抛向天花板来庆贺一下。老胡好容易找到了这个理由夺门而出。他的步子轻快了许多，办公室里的人们望着他的背影微笑。有人在谈论：这个模范评得对，老胡一年三百六十五天接车，去年工忙时，官厅水库的信件、报纸、包裹，一趟火车就是几百斤，来回搬运，老头子可一趟也没误过！邻站接车员要是误了接车，邮车就把误了的邮件在下一站交给老胡，再由他交给对开车的邮车。但是为了怕延误，往往老胡抽空搭了下一班没有邮车的火车把邮件给送去。为了这些事，他时常受到感谢和表扬。
    胡延龄回到自己的小屋抓起几只邮袋就往车站跑。女人衲着鞋底，坐在炕上尽嚷：“电话说啥事啊？”儿子在一边望着他，像用眼睛在发问似的。
    老胡走出几步，又掀帘子跨进一条腿：
    “告诉你们，我老胡可当了模范啦！——瞧你们娘俩的架打得有完不！”
    西边来的火车进站还早，钟声还没响，老胡背了几只不沉的邮袋往铁道旁走，他今天喜欢一个人在冷风里站一站，想想这是怎么回事。“模范”这是解放以后带来的新名词，不时地挂在人们口上，登在报纸上。他知道这是指工作上创造了新方法新成绩的人。当老胡在怀来邮局时，也参加过评选模范会议，自己也立过两次小功，成了先进工作者，但是没想到自己会成为模范。官厅邮局的同志们提过，说有一天要选他当模范，他摇摇头说：“一个接车员，没多大贡献！”
    胡延龄把皮帽子扣紧，望望红砖房车站旁的一列列穿蓝布棉制服的年轻人，他们正笑着、唱着、谈着，有人还在投掷着篮球。老胡猜得透：这又是北京哪个学校的学生来参观官厅水库，并且和那边的职工赛过球，正在候车回去。他忽然想起：自己虽已成了从官厅邮局产生的模范，却只在调来的一年半内去过一次官厅，那时工程还差得远，他在邮局里开过会后就匆匆回来了，段局长把拦河坝、溢洪道、输水道的拦洪导水作用大致讲了讲，他也没十分闹清是怎么回事，便谨守岗位地回来了。“和洪水斗争、和时间赛跑”的工地口号他清楚懂得。土木站这个地方是官厅水库工人和器材的集散地，也是邮件的集散地，当去年伏汛前工程紧张时工人到了四万多，老胡觉得自己的勤快和接邮件不误车，对工程局调拨器材、对工人们与家乡联系，都有好处。有时候接一趟车要搬运近千斤的邮袋，他像一个汽车马达似地开足了全劲，忘了累，忘了困，在一年多的期间，他每天要接日夜四趟火车送来的邮件，但没误过一次，接汽车邮件也没误过，最多时，每天运到工地的报纸就是八九十斤。
    “这是我老胡和洪水在斗争，和时间在赛跑啊！”他一向这样对官厅邮局的人说，对转运站的人说。现在他忽然想对那些不远几百里而来参观水库工程的人说说，并且告诉他们，自己是个生长在芦沟桥边的人，深深知道洪水是多么祸害人的东西，也深深知道永定河发起水来是多么可怕。他老胡也是注意着水库工程的人，为它的将要完工而高兴。他没有到水库跟前去看看，不是不爱水库，是为了抽不出身子来。这些邮件，无休无止往返的邮件，把他牢牢地钉住在土木车站了。
    火车在西边“呜呜”地响了，天空中飘散着煤烟，铁轨已隐隐在振动。老胡把邮局发的冬季工作服——皮大衣的钮扣扭好，站在这趟车的邮车停歇的老地方等候。
    列车吭当了一下，邮车的小门打开了，里面的邮务员像撕日历那样准确地一开门就看到了老胡，他的肩上、身旁满都是邮袋。如果碰到了下雪的日子，他满头满身的雪花，真像是一个雪弥陀来到了银白的车站。
      “没误点哪！”
     “误不了！”
    上下邮包就在这样公式的交谈中交换过，记录着上下多少邮件的单子也快速地彼此换递过了。
      “小张，这几天张家口冷不冷？”
    对于老胡所提的问题摸不清是怎么回事，小张淡淡地回答：“比北京冷得多喽！比你们这土木么，也差不多。干什么？要去是怎么的？”
      “没事没事，打听打听哪！”
    关上车门前，小张没忘了掷下一个小包，代老胡买的四两茶叶。大伙儿都知道老胡住在这荒村一样的车站上，便很乐意给他代买些生活需要的零星用品。虽说这车站二年来已不是荒村，客人上千上百地上下，供应官厅水库用的机器、水泥、钢筋、斗车、木材、煤炭……也是几列车几列车地卸下来；民工从张家口、通县、保定三个专区涌来；但是，这里仍只是个官厅水库的转运站，并没形成一个集镇。
    老胡刚走到半间小屋门旁，转运站的警卫员同志伸手送过来两个鸡蛋：“老胡同志：当了模范，连你家的小鸡子们也赶快下蛋来庆贺你呢！”这年轻小伙子笑嘻嘻地给老胡敬了一个礼。他经常给老胡拾鸡蛋。
    “这是哪儿来的事呢？我耽心这儿接车的事。人多的会还是没开过，唉——”他带着三分忧愁七分喜的面孔，进屋料理邮件去了。
    他的女人和前房儿子的争端似乎为了他当选模范的喜事和解了一些。事情原不严重，是为了儿子就业的问题。儿子因为工作成绩不好，从几个工作岗位上掉下来。继母把这解释成没出息，儿子却说成是偶然的过失，或是别人的误会。
   “你爸爸当模范，二十多岁的儿子也不能在家看锅台啊。”儿子对于这句话还不愿意顶撞，他也知道“模范”在新社会里的意义。当父亲在检点报纸的时候，儿子轻声地说：
   “爹，我明天上丰台啦。”这并没有使得老胡惊异，因为原有这么一个计划，有人给儿子在丰台介绍了一项工作，儿子挑三拣四，还没下定决心去是不去。这回他觉得再也不好意思不向模范爸爸看齐了。
    爹没吭声，就怕心乱而分错了邮件。他把要在土木附近分送的邮件留下来，马上把要带到官厅的邮件搬到外面装汽车。他又打了个电话给段局长，要小王带个邮局的钟来，他自己那个自从在车站背邮袋就买下的、使了二十六年的钟又要去修理了。还有，他希望小王明天乘早班车来，他有许多许多事情要交代。
    女人乐得闭不住嘴地给老胡打点行李，挑最好的衣服打包裹，老胡也乐了：“会见到些什么人呢？五十多岁的老模范，该给人个还不老的印象，我还能接二十年车呢。”
    半夜一点四十六分要接大同开北京的二一二次车。平时老胡在这以前总可以睡一觉，今天却怎么也宁静不下来。干了二十六年邮工，起先在大站上扛邮袋当苦力，七七事变以后在京南当乡邮员，就常听老乡们说起八路军打日本鬼子的故事，说起八路军多么照顾庄稼人，老胡心上微微透亮：敢情天下还有好人。之后，在丰台、南口、康庄、怀来、土木这些地方，老胡寂寞地在车站上接车，守着邮袋过了半辈子。日本鬼子、伪军汉奸、国民党匪帮，使他一年年勒紧肚皮，没有谁瞧得起这个小人物。只有在解放后，他的辛劳功绩才有人认出来了。在邮局里，以前是局长说什么是什么，像他这份接车员累死了也落不了好；如今呢，“大家平了，有错大家可以彼此批评了”。老胡最满意的是这一点。
    他最嘀咕在会上要讲话。贾主任已经大致告诉了他，一般的劳模大会是怎么个开法，听报告、小组讨论、发言、交流经验……还要参观厂矿、看戏看电影。
    “我有什么经验呢？”晚上，在接夜车前，老胡躺在被子里摸着胸脯打腹稿：“不怕风不怕雨就是了！白天想着：这是官厅水库的邮件！晚上也想着，这是官厅水库的邮件！邮件可以治洪水吗？我胡延龄说可以！我怕夜里两班车睡过去，捻紧了闹钟的铃弦，于是，前十分钟就叮零零响了起来。其实，老人是少瞌睡的，搞成了习惯，自己也就醒了。我在一九五三年搬了七万多公斤邮件，五十三万四千多封信，还有二十二万八千多份报纸……这些数目字并不多，比起修水库用的人力物力财力来，真是不够一个小零头啊。
      “人家也许会问：你一个老头子，胖胖??的，不怕累？我说，不累是说瞎话，只要心里一想起：这些邮件关系着工程材料的供应，关系着几万工人的穿的用的，关系着他们和外边的联系，和他们家里的联系，我就咬咬牙迈快步，肩膀上扛一百多斤一趟也不算什么了。有雨，我先用雨布遮住邮袋扛出去扛回来；天阴，我们娘儿三个把邮袋藏在半间屋里，炕上也堆成了小山，人转不过身子……”
    他又想：不应该只谈自己的工作，官厅邮局的十几位同志都是够辛苦的，除了负责五区、六区、山区中的乡邮，还有新修的铁路线上的邮政、水库的邮政。“只去年一年，官厅邮局向外兑出的汇票和保价信，就有一百三十亿元。四、五、六三个月民工最多，倘若经常是四万民工，这个数目字还要够呛！我一定得给另外各行各业的九十多位模范们说说，咱们的段局长在水库刚一开工时，怎么一个人打的天下，后来别的同志在工人多的时候怎么在深更半夜还到工人宿舍接汇款、为一天三班工人服务。还有去年大水冲坏了公路的时候，官厅邮局的人怎么人人往土木来回背邮件，一天走七八十里路，人家的辛苦也得让大伙儿知道知道……”一点半了，老胡穿起衣服，提了马灯走出去，准备接大同到北京的二一二次车。他怀里揣着那只比儿子年纪还大的闹钟，想托邮车上的同志带到北京去修一修，虽然铺子里说这只钟太老旧了，难修得好，可是老胡总不相信，他心里想：“修钟就不能找个窍门、克服困难么？”跟这趟车的邮务员们已经听说老胡要去张家口参加劳动模范大会了，他们知道这次大会上会有生产战线上的许多英雄人物出席。抛起邮袋来就像抛皮球似的年轻邮务员羡慕地对老胡说：“真棒啊，老伙计，人家全是工厂里的，农村里的，矿上的，铁路上的……你这接车员，全国十二万多邮电职工里的一个，也能当上模范，真不歹！”
    老胡的圆圆的忠实的眼睛笑得像个孩子似的，手里还提着一个刚邮来的流动图书箱，沙哑地说：
  “这叫行行出状元哪。我是沾了毛主席的光，沾了官厅水库的光啦！”他一边把闹钟交给对方。“劳驾了，又得修修，跑得不准点啦。”小伙子笑笑说：“又是它，该买个新的啦。老胡同志，您的眼前一天到晚除了车站就是火车，除了邮袋就是报卷，这回去开开眼吧。听听首长们的讲话吧，一定是有关总路线的，许还能带回亮晶晶的奖章，毛主席的大照片……”小伙子的声音被火车开行的声音淹没了，邮车的板门慢慢地掩上。他的善意的笑脸像是给老胡心上吹过来一阵春风，老头子步子举得轻快起来，他还在使右手举成个喇叭筒儿似的，一边喊着：“别忘了替我修钟啊，挑好手艺的……”他踅回小屋，准备打个盹儿，再接早晨五点多的北京到大同的火车。
