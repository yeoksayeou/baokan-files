American Aggressors in Asia

    Why is Wiley clamoring?

    According to a United Press International dispatch from New York, United Nations, March 27, just as the Vietnam People's Army was achieving significant victories on the outskirts of Dien Bien Phu, U.S. Senator Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Wiley clamored for France to "hold the line" and "persevere," saying that the U.S. government "will give them the needed assistance in materials, trainers, and experts," etc., otherwise, they would "be in terrible straits."

    Why is Wiley so anxious? The "New York Herald Tribune" answered this question: "From the deepest meaning of American interests, this war is precisely our (America's) war." "U.S. News & World Report" even openly admitted: America has "stuck one foot into a new war (referring to the Indochina War)!"

      Japanese People "Must Not Become Guinea Pigs for Experimentation"

    According to Tokyo reports: The Japanese fishing boat Fukuryu Maru No. 5 encountered a U.S. hydrogen bomb explosion test near Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific, and 23 fishermen on board were injured.

    This incident has aroused the anger of the Japanese people. Even Japan's bourgeois newspapers have expressed a "firm and extreme opposition to war and atomic weapons" (International News Service Tokyo, March 28). "Asahi Shimbun" complained: American doctors not only do not "concentrate their efforts" to treat these injured fishermen, but also treat the fishermen as "guinea pig experiments." "Shakai Shinpo" also said in an editorial calling for the banning of atomic weapons: "We, the Japanese people who have suffered the pain of the first and second atomic bombs and have now suffered the pain of a hydrogen bomb, must fully utilize our experience to serve the interests of world civilization. In other words, we must issue a strong appeal to the world, demanding the banning of these weapons. We must not become guinea pigs for experimentation."

      New Essay Topic for Japanese Elementary School Students

    Not long ago, the U.S. "Chicago Sun-Times" published a short article in its two hundred and forty-third issue, titled: "It can be said with certainty that American prestige in Japan has fallen to its lowest point."

    The paper wrote: "Japanese elementary school students are writing essays on topics such as: 'Why I Hate Americans.'" This was announced by Richard Deverall, the U.S. Labor Federation's "ambassador" to Japan, at an official banquet held by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Deverall said that the Japan Teachers Union is one of the main forces in the anti-American wave sweeping across Japan; "American prestige has never been so low in Japan, and our foreign policy has gone bankrupt."

      "Scientists" Who Hang Up a Sheep's Head But Sell Dog Meat

    According to a TASS dispatch from Kabul on March 20, various American "scientists" have recently been constantly active in Afghanistan. According to a communiqué from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul: A group of "archaeologists" and "anthropologists" led by "Professor" Carleton Coon recently came to Afghanistan to determine which part of the world sheep and goats were first domesticated. And they do not often go to other places, but are particularly interested in the areas of Afghanistan bordering the Soviet Union.

    Isn't the ulterior motive of these so-called "scientists" obvious? (Picture attached)

    美国侵略者在亚洲
    维利为什么叫嚣
    据合众社纽约联合国三月二十七日电讯消息，正当越南人民军在奠边府外围取得重大胜利的时候，美国参议院外交委员会主席维利叫嚣着要法国“守住战线”，“坚持下去”，并说美国政府“将给予他们需要的物资、训练人员与专家方面的援助”等等，否则，他们就“将处于可怕的困境中”了。
    维利为什么这样焦急呢？“纽约先驱论坛报”回答了这个问题：“从美国利益这一极深刻的意义来说，这个战争正是我们（美国）的战争”。“美国新闻与世界报道”更公开地承认：美国的“一只脚已插入了一个新的战争（指印度支那战争）”！
      日本人民“决不能成为供实验的豚鼠”
    据东京消息：日本渔船福龙丸第五号在南太平洋比基尼岛附近遇到美国氢弹爆炸试验，船上的渔夫二十三人受伤。
    这个事件发生后，已引起日本人民的愤怒。甚至日本的资产阶级报纸也表示了“坚决的极端反对战争、反对原子武器的态度”（国际新闻社东京三月二十八日电）。“朝日新闻”不满地说：美国医生不但不“集中力量”医治这些受伤的渔民，而且还把渔民当作“豚鼠实验”。“社会新闻”在一篇要求禁用原子武器的社论中也说：“吃过第一枚和第二枚原子弹的苦头、并且又吃了一枚氢弹苦头的我们日本人民，必须充分利用我们的经验来为世界文明谋利益。换言之，我们必须向全世界发出强有力的呼吁，要求禁用这些武器。我们决不能成为供实验的豚鼠。”
      日本小学生作文的新题目
    不久前美国“芝加哥太阳时报”二百四十三期上刊载了一篇短文，题目是：“可以肯定地说，在日本美国的威信已降到最低点。”
    该报写道：“日本小学生用这样的题目做作文：‘为什么我痛恨美国人’。”这件事是美国劳工联合会驻日“大使”里卡德·戴维罗在芝加哥对外关系委员会中举行的官方宴会上宣布的。戴维罗说，日本教师工会是席卷日本全国的反美浪潮中的主要力量之一；“在日本，美国的威信从来还没有低落到这种地步，我们的对外政策遭到了破产”。
      挂羊头卖狗肉的“科学家”
    据塔斯社喀布尔三月二十日电讯报道，在阿富汗境内，近来不断出现美国各种各样“科学家”的活动。据喀布尔美国大使馆的公报说：最近以卡尔顿·康恩“教授”率领的一批“考古家”和“人类学家”，到阿富汗来是要确定绵羊和山羊首先是在世界的那一部分驯化的。而他们并不常到别的地方去，却只对阿富汗与苏联毗邻的地区兴趣特别浓厚。
    这些所谓“科学家”的别有用心，不是很明显吗？（附图片）
