Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd:

    The National Higher Finance and Economics Education Conference concluded on the 22nd. The conference determined the direction and tasks of higher finance and economics education, clarified the position of finance and economics education in the overall national economic construction, and, in conjunction with the teaching experience discussion meeting of the Renmin University of China, deeply studied the teaching reform work of higher finance and economics schools, and drafted teaching plans for majors such as industrial economics, agricultural economics, and national economic planning.
    According to the general task of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, the conference determined that the future direction of higher finance and economics education is: to cultivate, in a planned and proportional manner, senior economic theorists and financial and economic specialists who serve the country's socialist construction, are physically fit, love the motherland, possess a certain level of Marxist-Leninist ideological awareness and a certain amount of economic theory and professional knowledge. In order to cultivate talents that meet these requirements, it is necessary to implement the policy of learning from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union and combining it with China's reality in teaching reform. In terms of work pace, higher finance and economics education should continue to implement the work policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improvement of quality, and steady progress," and especially vigorously improve quality in order to create conditions for development. In the future, it is necessary to appropriately adjust majors, expand the cultivation of industrial economics, industrial statistics, and industrial accounting personnel needed by industrial departments and factories and mines, and cultivate specialized personnel in national economic planning, agricultural economics, political economics, finance, banking, trade, and cooperatives in appropriate proportions. In order to meet the needs of business departments to improve the skills of on-the-job cadres, and to effectively carry out teaching reforms and gradually increase the proportion of worker-peasant students in higher finance and economics colleges in a planned way, finance and economics colleges should also be entrusted by business departments to train an appropriate number of on-the-job cadres in a planned way, especially on-the-job cadres in finance, banking, and cooperative departments. The goal is to raise the backbone of existing on-the-job cadres to a level suitable for socialist construction. The economics departments of comprehensive universities generally set up political economics majors to train economic theory and scientific research talents and teachers for universities. At present, some colleges and universities can appropriately set up other finance and economics majors on the basis of the original ones.
    The conference emphasized that each finance and economics college should focus on training on-the-job cadres and running worker-peasant rapid middle schools in a certain period in the future, and should vigorously improve the quality of teaching in order to cultivate qualified financial and economic management talents. On the premise that the normal progress of undergraduate teaching is not affected by the school buildings, teachers, and equipment of each finance and economics college, and on the condition that the business department can solve the transfer of cadres and the required funds, it should be entrusted by the business department to run special courses or training courses in a planned way to train on-the-job cadres. The training period is generally one to two years. If there are special needs, it can also be appropriately shortened, but it should not be less than half a year. If individual schools have the conditions, they can open night schools, correspondence classes, or cadre amateur lectures. In the future, the enrollment of higher finance and economics schools must pay attention to gradually increasing the proportion of students from worker and peasant backgrounds. Each school should strive to attach worker-peasant rapid middle schools to recruit worker and peasant cadres to enroll, and after graduation, enter undergraduate studies, and negotiate with business departments to strive to transfer a part of on-the-job cadres to undergraduate studies. At the same time, the political and ideological education of young students must also be given practical attention and greatly strengthened.
    The conference pointed out that the key to carrying out teaching reform by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union lies in improving teachers' Marxist-Leninist ideological level. It is required that all schools strengthen Marxist-Leninist theoretical education and combine it with business. Secondly, it is necessary to implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice; do a good job in the work of teaching and research offices and give play to the collectivist spirit of teachers.
    At the closing of the conference, Huang Songling, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, made a concluding report. He said: This conference has increased everyone's confidence in running higher finance and economics schools well, and realized that finance and economics education has a future. He asked the heads of higher finance and economics schools to improve their leadership style, strengthen political and ideological leadership, collective leadership, and specific leadership; correctly implement the Party's policy of uniting and improving intellectuals, carry out criticism and self-criticism and free debate on academic matters, in order to improve finance and economics education, improve teaching quality and scientific level.

    全国高等财经教育会议结束
    确定高等财经教育的方针
    【新华社二十三日讯】全国高等财经教育会议已在二十二日结束。这次会议确定了高等财经教育的方针任务，明确了财经教育在整个国家经济建设事业中的地位，并结合中国人民大学教学经验讨论会，深入研究了高等财经学校的教学改革工作，拟订出工业经济、农业经济和国民经济计划等专业的教学计划。
    会议根据国家过渡时期的总任务和第一个五年计划的基本任务，确定今后高等财经教育的方针是：有计划按比例地培养为国家社会主义建设服务的、体格健全、热爱祖国、具有一定马克思列宁主义思想水平和具有一定经济理论与专业知识的高级经济理论人材和财经专门人材。为了培养合乎这种要求的人材，必须贯彻学习苏联先进教学经验并和中国实际相结合的教学改革的方针。在工作步调上高等财经教育仍应贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，尤其要大力提高质量，以创造条件，准备发展。今后要适当地调整专业，扩大培养工业部门和厂矿企业需要的工业经济、工业统计、工业会计人材，并按适当比例培养国民经济计划、农业经济、政治经济学、财政、银行、贸易、合作社等专门人材。为了适应业务部门提高在职干部的需要，并切实地进行教学改革，逐步地有计划地增加高等财经院校工农学生的比重，今后财经学院又应当有计划地接受业务部门委托，调训适当数量的在职干部，尤其是财政、银行、合作社等部门的在职干部。以求把现有在职干部里的骨干提高到适应于社会主义建设所需要的水平。综合大学的经济系一般设置政治经济学专业，培养经济理论和科学研究人材及高等学校师资，目前有些院校可就原有基础适当设置其他财经专业。
    会议强调指出，各财经学院在今后一定时期内应把调训在职干部和办好工农速成中学作为重点，应大力提高教学质量，以求培养合乎规格的财经管理人材。各财经学院在校舍、师资、设备不影响本科教学工作的正常进行的情况下，在业务部门能解决抽调干部和所需经费的条件下，应有计划地接受业务部门委托办理专修科或训练班，调训在职干部。训练期限以一年到二年为原则，如有特殊需要，也可酌量缩短，但不得少于半年。个别学校如有条件，可开办夜校、函授班或干部业余讲座。今后高等财经学校招生必须注意逐渐增加学生工农成分比重，各校争取附设工农速成中学，招收工农干部入学，毕业后升入本科学习，并和业务部门协商，争取抽调一部分在职干部入本科学习。同时对青年学生的政治思想教育工作，亦须切实注意大力加强。
    会议指出，学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革的关键，在于提高教师的马克思列宁主义思想水平。要求各校加强马克思列宁主义理论教育，并使之和业务相结合。其次，要贯彻理论结合实际的教学方针；作好教研室工作，发挥教师集体主义精神。
    会议闭幕时，中央人民政府高等教育部副部长黄松龄作了总结报告，他说：这次会议提高了大家办好高等财经学校的信心，认识到财经教育是有前途的。他要求高等财经学校负责人改进领导作风，加强政治思想领导、集体领导和具体领导；正确执行党团结提高知识分子的政策，开展批评与自我批评和学术上的自由争论，以改进财经教育工作，提高教学质量和科学水平。
