Editor's Note: Under the leadership of the Party and with the continuous improvement of enterprise management level, all employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant have promoted advanced experience and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, so that production has steadily increased month by month. On February 20th, March 5th, and March 15th, the plant successively created new records for daily steel production since its opening. On March 11th, all employees of the plant wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting their production achievements and guaranteeing to comprehensively fulfill the March national plan one day ahead of schedule and overfulfill the first quarter plan. As a result of their efforts, they completed the March national plan three days ahead of schedule and the first quarter national plan eight days ahead of schedule. The steel output in the first quarter exceeded the national plan by 10.2%, the qualified rate increased by 0.52% compared with the national plan, and the cost was reduced by more than 6 billion yuan. The output of high-quality steel exceeded the national plan every month in the three months. Today, this newspaper publishes articles by the plant director, the Party committee secretary, and several labor models talking about their work experience. We hope that the comrades of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant will not be arrogant or rash, make persistent efforts, continue to tap potential, pay attention to overcoming shortcomings, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the second quarter and 1954 national plans. We also hope that all factories and mines across the country can work hard to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan.

    Improve Branch Work and Deeply Solve the Ideological Problems of the Masses
    Lu Zheng, Secretary of the CPC Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant Committee

    This year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the first quarter's national plan for the first time since its opening. Here, the work of the Party organization is an indispensable factor.

    At the beginning of January this year, as in previous years, production fluctuated greatly, and the daily plan from January 5th to 8th was not completed, and the masses' thinking was very chaotic. In the past, when we encountered this situation, we only generally called on everyone not to slack off, but we didn't know how many people were slackening, to what extent they were slackening, what it manifested in, or what to grasp to prevent everyone from slackening. This year, the Party committee organized forces to find out the ideological situation of the masses, and learned that the masses' slack mood was various: many people were waiting passively, watching production problems occur continuously, but not actively trying to overcome difficulties. Some people were careless and did not pay attention to safety. Departmentalism and individualism also began to emerge: some workers violated operating procedures in order for their team to produce more steel, resulting in waste products, or failed to create favorable conditions for the next shift, affecting the next shift's production. In particular, the fact that some workers were preparing to return home for the Spring Festival posed a great threat to the completion of the January and February plans. There were still many days before the Spring Festival, but the workers were already calculating how long they would be home and what to bring back. When they were at work, they were also noisy all day long, this one asking if your family had slaughtered pigs, that one asking what New Year's goods they had prepared and when they would leave. In December, the workers often looked at the work plan to see if they had completed the tasks of their own work procedure, but at this time they didn't pay much attention. After investigation by the Party branch, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, the Party committee accurately grasped these ideological situations, and also figured out how many people in each class were going home, the reasons for each person's return home, and also grasped the daily changes in the situation.

    Now that the problems are clear, how to solve them? In the past, a few full-time Party cadres who were divorced from production would discuss the solutions, and then hold a branch general meeting to assign the tasks. At the branch general meeting, only the branch secretary would give a report, and the party members rarely spoke. Only the branch secretary criticized the party members, and the party members rarely criticized the work of the branch. Because of the lack of mass supervision, the branch secretary's criticism of the people below was not very effective, and it was over after the criticism. This year, we learned from the branch work experience of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and brought the production key and the chaos of the masses' thinking to the branch general meeting for discussion. At the branch general meeting, we let go of democracy, and everyone criticized the shortcomings of the branch and administrative leaders, and also conducted criticism and self-criticism with each other. Finally, after detailed discussion, a resolution was made to guarantee the completion of the plan and to implement the spirit of last year's Party Congress to "strengthen the unity of the three shifts and establish an overall concept," and some party members were designated to be responsible for checking the implementation of the resolution of the branch general meeting. After the meeting, the Party groups revised the guarantee plans of each party member according to the resolution of the branch general meeting. The trade union and the Communist Youth League also held meetings separately to mobilize trade union members and Communist Youth League members to respond to the Party's call and make personal plans to guarantee the completion of the tasks. Later, after inspection, 85% of the party members had implemented their plans well. The party members of the No. 2 open hearth furnace persuaded the masses to guarantee full attendance during the Spring Festival. A party member who was preparing to go home to get married voluntarily postponed the wedding date. The third shift of the open hearth furnace strengthened its unity, and the party members took the lead in maintaining the furnace body, extending the life of the furnace body, so that the furnace repair time of each furnace did not coincide, ensuring the completion of the plan on a daily basis. At the second branch general meeting, after the party member responsible for checking the implementation of the resolution reported the inspection results to the meeting, everyone criticized those who did not seriously implement the resolution mercilessly. They criticized the branch secretary for not criticizing and educating the party members who did not implement the resolution well, and for not strictly checking and supervising them. They criticized a party member of the molten iron group for going home without asking for leave, being absent from work for several days, and affecting production. A probationary party member of the No. 4 open hearth furnace was also exposed for not being truthful in his operation records. These party members who were criticized all made self-criticisms at the meeting, put forward ways to correct them, and earnestly fulfilled their guarantee conditions in their subsequent practical actions.

    Completing the plan must rely on the efforts of all employees. Therefore, the Party committee decided to strengthen the leadership of propagandists. In the past, our propagandists also carried out propaganda activities in coordination with the central work. However, at that time, they generally talked more about principles to the masses, and did not do enough to tell the masses what was right and what was wrong in a simple and vivid form through real people and real events, and to carry out mass criticism and self-criticism. Because we did not praise the good examples among the masses in a timely manner, and did not strictly criticize the bad examples, the advanced things could not grow and develop quickly, and the backward things were more likely to spread among the masses. This year, we realized this, and the propaganda work was more in-depth and meticulous. After the propagandists' congress, blackboards, trade union tabloids, broadcasts, and clapper talks became active. Soon, cartoons appeared in the tabloids. One of them depicted a worker leading a small donkey from the livestock market, and below it was written by name: "So-and-so is absent from work to buy a donkey for his family." Another one depicted a worker leading his wife and children, carrying a basket, shopping for New Year's goods on the street, and below it was written by name: "So-and-so is absent from work to shop for New Year's goods on the street." The blackboard also had criticisms and praises by name. Everyone could immediately hear from the broadcast which class operated well and which class operated badly every day. Whoever violated discipline and violated operating procedures, and where there was an accident due to carelessness, the blackboard and the broadcast would immediately announce it. In this way, the atmosphere in the workshop quickly changed. A few days ago, everyone was talking about how to go home for the New Year, but at this time everyone was criticizing those who were absent from work to shop for New Year's goods and buy donkeys. The advanced things among the masses were also quickly spread through these propaganda activities, becoming a huge force to promote the completion of the plan, and the masses' eyes were all looking at them, learning from their examples.

    After the ideological problems of the masses were solved, the Party committee led the trade union to systematically sum up the labor competition in November and December last year, and rewarded the winners in the competition, so that these advanced elements continued to become the backbone in the competition. In the competition, the trade union also seized the key issues in production, and systematically held production meetings and promoted advanced experience. At these meetings, the masses automatically exposed the phenomena of incoordination and non-cooperation in their work, and worked out ways to solve the problems. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses was organized and systematically guided to solve the key problems in production, ensuring the regularization of the labor competition, and increasing the number of fast steelmaking furnaces from 13 in January and 14 in February to 51 in March. Other economic and technical indicators also improved month by month, and finally all the conditions we guaranteed to Chairman Mao were fulfilled.

    编者按：鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂全体职工，在党的领导下，和在企业管理水平不断提高的情形下，推广了先进经验，贯彻了苏联专家建议，使生产情况逐月稳步上升。二月二十日、三月五日和十五日，该厂连续创造了开工以来日产钢量的新记录。三月十一日，该厂全体职工写信给毛主席报告生产成绩，并保证提前一天全面完成三月份国家计划和超额完成第一季度计划。他们努力的结果，提前三天完成了三月份国家计划；提前八天完成第一季度国家计划。第一季度产钢量较国家计划超过百分之十点二，合格率较国家计划提高百分之零点五二，降低成本六十多亿元；优质钢的产量在三个月中月月都超过了国家计划。今天，本报发表了该厂厂长、党委书记和几位劳动模范谈他们的工作经验的文章。我们希望鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂的同志们不骄不躁，再接再厉，继续挖掘潜力，注意克服缺点，为全面超额完成第二季度和一九五四年的国家计划而努力。更希望全国所有的工厂矿山都能为全面超额完成国家计划而努力。
    改进支部工作，深入解决群众思想问题
    中共鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂委员会书记  路政
    今年，鞍钢炼钢厂从开工以来第一次全面地超额完成了第一季度的国家计划。这里，党组织的工作是个不可忽视的因素。
    今年一月初和往年一样，生产波动很大，一月五日到八日的日计划都没有完成，群众思想非常混乱。往年遇到这种情况，我们只是一般地号召大家不要松劲，但是究竟有多少人松劲，松劲到什么程度，表现在什么地方，究竟抓住什么就可以使大家不松劲，却不知道。今年，党委组织力量摸清了群众的思想情况，知道了群众的松劲情绪是各种各样的：有很多人是消极等待，眼看着生产连续发生问题，却不去积极设法克服困难。有些人麻痹大意，不注意安全。本位主义个人主义也开始作祟：有的工人为了本班多出钢而违犯操作规程，造成废品，或者是不给下班创造有利条件影响下班生产。特别是若干工人准备春节回家，对一二月份完成计划威胁很大。离春节还有好多天，工人们就在盘算着回家多久，带什么东西。在上班的时候也是成天吵吵嚷嚷，这个问你家杀猪没有，那个问办了些什么年货，什么时候动身。十二月份，工人们经常看作业计划，看是否完成了自己工序的任务，这时候都不怎么注意了。党支部、工会和青年团进行调查后，党委准确地掌握了这些思想情况，并且弄清楚了每个班究竟有多少人要回家，每个人要回家的原因，并且掌握了每天情况的变化。
    问题弄清了，怎样解决呢？过去，总是少数脱离生产的党的专职干部商量一下办法，然后开个支部大会，把任务布置下去。在支部大会上经常只有支部书记做报告，党员们很少发言，只有支部书记批评党员，党员很少批评支部的工作。因为缺少群众的监督，支部书记对下面的批评效果也不大，批评完就算了。今年，我们学习了哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的支部工作经验，把生产关键和群众思想的混乱情况拿到支部大会上讨论。在支部大会上放手发扬民主，大家批评了支部和行政领导的缺点，相互之间也进行了批评和自我批评。最后，经过详细讨论，做出了保证完成计划和贯彻去年党代表大会
  “加强三班团结，树立整体观念”的决议，并指定了
  一些党员负责检查支部大会决议的执行情况。会后，党小组都根据支部大会的决议，修订了每个党员的保证计划。工会和青年团也分别召开会议，动员工会会员和青年团员响应党的号召，做出保证完成任务的个人计划。以后，经过检查，百分之八十五的党员都很好地执行了自己的计划。二号平炉的党员说服了群众，保证了春节期间全勤。有一个预备回家结婚的党员自动地把婚期推迟了。平炉三班加强了团结，党员带头维护炉体，延长了炉体寿命，使各炉修炉时间不碰头，保证了按日完成计划。在第二次的支部大会上，负责检查决议执行情况的党员向大会报告了检查结果之后，大家对不严肃执行决议的人毫不容情地提出了批评。他们批评支部书记对于执行决议不好的党员批评教育不够，检查督促不严；批评铁水组一个党员没有请假就回家，旷工好几天，影响生产。四号平炉有一个候补党员，操作时的作业记录不真实，也被大家揭发了出来。这些受到批评的党员都在会上作了检讨，提出了改正的办法，并在以后的实际行动中认真实现了自己的保证条件。
    完成计划必须依靠全体职工的努力。因此，党委又决定加强对宣传员的领导。过去我们的宣传员也配合中心工作进行宣传活动。但是，那时一般的是向群众讲道理多，通过真人真事用朴素的形象化的形式告诉群众那对那不对，开展群众性的批评和自我批评做的却不够。因为我们对于群众中的好的事例表扬得不及时，坏的事例批评得不严格，结果是先进的事物不能很快地生长发展，落后的东西反而容易在群众中传播开来。今年，我们认识到了这一点，宣传工作也就比较深入细致了。宣传员大会开过以后，黑板报、工会小报、广播、快板都活跃起来。很快地小报上出现了一幅幅的漫画。这一幅上面画着一个工人从牲口市场上牵来了一头小毛驴，下面指名指姓地写着“某某某不上班旷工去替家里买毛驴”。那边画着一个工人领着老婆孩子，手里提着篮子在大街上办年货，下面指名写着：“某某人不上班旷工上街去办年货”。黑板报上也是一条一条的有名有姓的批评和表扬。每天那班操作得好那班操作得坏，大家立刻都可以从广播中听到。谁不遵守纪律违犯了操作规程，那里因为麻痹大意出了事故，黑板报、广播立刻就给宣布。这样一来，车间里的空气很快转变了。几天前大家还都在谈论着怎样回家过年，这时候大家都在批评那些旷工去办年货买毛驴的。群众中的先进事物也通过这些宣传活动迅速地传播开来，成了推动完成计划的巨大力量，群众的眼睛都看着他们，照着他们的榜样学习。
    在群众的思想问题解决以后，党委领导工会有计划地总结了去年十一月十二月的劳动竞赛，奖励了竞赛中的优胜者，使这些先进分子继续成为竞赛中的骨干。在竞赛中，工会又抓住生产中的关键问题，有计划地开好生产会议和推广先进经验。在这些会议上，群众自动揭发了工作中不协调不配合的现象，研究出了解决问题的办法。这样就把群众的热情有组织有计划地引导到解决生产的关键问题上面来，保证了劳动竞赛的经常化，使快速炼钢从一月份的十三炉、二月份的十四炉，增加到了三月份的五十一炉。其他各项经济技术指标也同样一月比
  一月提高，终于全部实现了我们向毛主席所保证的条件。
