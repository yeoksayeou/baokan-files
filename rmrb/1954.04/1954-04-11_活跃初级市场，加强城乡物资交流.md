Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain nationwide, great achievements have been made. The grain purchase plans in the vast majority of regions have been completed and overfulfilled, the planned supply of grain in urban and rural areas has been widely launched, and the appearance of rural areas in various places has also undergone new changes. This is a great achievement. However, we should also note that due to changes in the laws of the rural market after the unified purchase and sale, commercial work has not yet fully adapted to these changes. Since the Spring Festival, primary markets in some areas have been inactive, and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has been un畅通 (unchang tong - literally "unobstructed"). This situation has become an issue that cannot be ignored in the current economic life. Striving to invigorate the primary markets and strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is the urgent task at hand.

When hundreds of billions of jin of commodity grain and oil, etc., are removed from the free market and severed from capitalist operations, the laws of commodity circulation must also undergo fundamental changes. The broad masses of people welcome this change. Because this change makes it easier to expand the position of the socialist state-owned economy and cooperative economy in rural areas, makes it easier to strengthen the state's management and leadership of the primary market, and guides it towards a stable and prosperous path; at the same time, according to the needs of the people's lives reflected by the changing market conditions, we can also more easily further develop production according to the needs of the people. However, after the original commercial network has changed, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have not been able to take on all the tasks of urban-rural exchange for a while. The commercial and cooperative departments in many areas have not promptly organized and arranged possible and necessary market exchanges and social adjustments. We still have great blindness in commercial leadership, and the reflection of market conditions is often insensitive, so we often do not deal with it in a timely manner. This is also one of the important reasons for the current inactive primary market and the direct impact on the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Our current task, especially in the commercial field, is to constantly and closely monitor the market situation, strengthen leadership over the market, overcome blindness, and try to avoid those shortcomings and errors that must be avoided and can be avoided.

In order to invigorate the primary market and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the primary task at present is to actively carry out rural grain adjustment work. This requires the establishment of state-managed grain markets in market towns to allow farmers and consumers to trade directly in the market in accordance with government laws and regulations; at the same time, farmers who trade grain with each other outside the grain market for the purpose of mutual assistance should not be prohibited as long as they do not sell to grain merchants. Doing so can provide an opportunity for households with surplus grain or households who temporarily need to sell grain to solve current problems, and it can also cooperate with the state's planned supply work to ensure the needs of grain-deficient households and non-staple food workshops. The experience of many regions has proved that this is an indispensable measure to invigorate the primary market. Some rural work cadres, after implementing the planned supply of grain, believe that restoring the grain market is troublesome and attempt to completely take over the work of grain adjustment and exchange by the state. This idea is obviously wrong.

Rural sideline products are one of the important sources of goods in the primary market and an important part of the rural economy. Sideline production must be rapidly restored and developed. The most important issue in current sideline production is to vigorously develop pig and livestock raising and increase the production of oil crops. As everyone knows, pork and oils are necessities of the daily lives of the broad masses of people and important materials for national exports. If we can continuously increase the output of live pigs and oils, we can further invigorate urban and rural economic exchanges and vigorously support the needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, and national industrial construction. In order to increase live pig production, we must earnestly solve the feed problem. A portion of grain, wheat bran, and bean cake should be allocated to rural areas in a planned manner to support the pig-raising industry. At the same time, the establishment of rural primary grain markets should be used to restore the production of flour mills, tofu workshops, etc., which is also an important aspect of increasing live pig production. According to statistics from six counties, including Tunliu and Changzi, in the Changzhi area of Shanxi Province, there are a total of 1,779 small flour mills, which require 25.6 million jin of raw materials such as corn and sorghum throughout the year, and the small flour produced is equivalent to 21.76 million jin of grain. In addition, they can produce 850,000 jin of pork and 3 million dan of pig manure, enough fertilizer for 430,000 mu of land, which can increase grain production by 10 million jin. That is to say, after offsetting the two, grain production can still be increased by 6.16 million jin per year, and a large amount of pork can also be produced. Therefore, restoring sideline production is not only an important issue in invigorating the primary market at present, but also a long-term and important task in developing the rural economy.

In the work of invigorating the primary market and strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, state-owned stores and cooperatives must organize and lead private commerce and make the greatest efforts to strengthen the promotion of industrial products to rural areas and the purchase of agricultural products, sideline products, and local specialties. In the past few years, state-owned commerce and cooperatives have paid more attention to the processing and ordering of industrial products, etc., in opening up sources of goods. This is completely necessary, and in the long term, industrial products will still not be able to fully meet the needs of the people, and it is still necessary to continuously increase the quantity of industrial products. Need always comes before production. This is the law of socialism and the driving force for stimulating continuous development of production. However, the level of industrial and agricultural production in our country cannot be generally improved all at once, and after the people have a certain amount of daily-use industrial products, they also demand to eat better and dress better. With the development of national industrial construction, the demand for export native and special products has also increased. Therefore, opening up rural sources of goods has been raised to an important position. Many products in rural areas can solve many problems as long as they are good at organizing adjustments.

In order to vigorously open up rural sources of goods, state-owned commerce and cooperatives, in addition to their own efforts, must also pay great attention to organizing other economic forces and giving play to their role. For example, in order to increase the commodities in the primary market and supply farmers with production and living materials, it is very important to earnestly organize and develop handicraft production. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should shoulder the main task in this regard. In order to connect urban and rural materials, organizing the strength of private merchants is also necessary and possible. Private merchants are still a relatively large force at present, and it is wrong to completely deny their role in the transition period, and it is not conducive to the normal development of the national economy. In some places, the method of jointly purchasing with private merchants in rural areas for materials other than grain and oil is adopted. This is a form of state capitalism, and other places can imitate it. If this method is done well, it can not only avoid various spontaneous activities, but also help solve current needs.

Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership, repeatedly explain the grain policy and commercial policy to cadres, conduct in-depth publicity and education to the masses, and create and use correct methods to invigorate the primary market and strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. As long as our work is done well, we will definitely be able to complete the current tasks.

### 活跃初级市场，加强城乡物资交流

    活跃初级市场，加强城乡物资交流
    全国实行粮食统购统销以来，已获得巨大成就。绝大多数地区的粮食收购计划已经完成和超额完成，城乡粮食计划供应工作已经广泛展开，各地农村的面貌也已发生了新的变化。这是一个伟大的成绩。但是，我们还应该注意，由于统购统销后农村市场规律发生变化，商业工作还不能完全适应于这种变化，春节以后，某些地区的初级市场不活跃，城乡物资交流不通畅。这种情况，已成为当前经济生活中的一个不可忽视的问题。努力活跃初级市场，加强城乡物资交流，这就是当前的迫切任务。
    当着成百亿斤的商品粮食和油料等脱离了自由市场，和资本主义的经营割断了联系之后，货物流转的规律也必然要随着发生根本的变化。广大人民是欢迎这种变化的。因为这种变化更便于扩大社会主义性质的国营经济和合作社经济在农村中的阵地，更便于加强国家对初级市场的管理和领导，并把它引向稳固的繁荣的道路；同时，根据变化着的市场状况所反映出来的人民群众的生活需要，我们也就更便于依照人民的需要来进一步发展生产。但是，在原有的商业网发生了变化以后，国营商业和合作社商业一时还不能把城乡交流的全部任务担当起来，不少地区的商业和合作社部门，还没有及时组织与安排可能和必需的市场交换与社会调剂，我们在商业的领导方面，仍然存在着很大的盲目性，对于市场情况的反映常常不灵，因而在处置上常常不及时，这也是造成目前初级市场不活跃和直接影响城乡物资交流的重要原因之一。我们目前的任务，特别是在商业方面的任务就是要经常地密切地注视市场的情况，加强对于市场的领导，克服盲目性，尽量避免那些必须避免而又可能避免的缺点和错误。
    为了活跃初级市场，促进城乡物资交流，当前首要的任务，就是积极进行农村粮食调剂工作。这就需要在集镇中设立由国家管理的粮食市场，使农民和消费者在场内按政府法令直接交易；同时，对于农民在粮食市场外彼此以互通有无为目的而交易粮食的，只要不是卖给粮食商贩，也不应禁止。这样做可以使余粮户或暂时需要将粮食出售以解决当前问题的农户得到出售的机会，也可以配合国家的计划供应工作保证缺粮户和副食作坊的需要。不少地区的经验，证明了这是活跃初级市场的一项必不可少的措施。有些农村工作干部，在实行粮食计划供应后，认为恢复粮食市场是找麻烦，企图把粮食的调剂交换工作完全由国家包下来，这种思想，显然是错误的。
    农村副业产品，是初级市场的重要货源之一，也是农村经济的重要组成部分，必须使副业生产迅速恢复和发展起来。当前副业生产最重要的问题，就是要大力发展养猪养畜事业和增加油料农作物的生产。大家知道，猪肉和油脂是广大人民日常生活的必需品，也是国家出口的重要物资，如果我们能使毛猪和油脂的产量不断增加，就可以进一步活跃城乡经济交流，有力地支援城市、工矿区的需要和国家工业建设。为了增加毛猪生产，就必须认真解决饲料问题，应该有计划地抽调一部分粮食、麸糠、豆饼，供给农村，扶助养猪事业。同时，应该通过农村初级粮食市场的建立，恢复粉坊、豆腐坊等的生产，这也是增加毛猪生产的一个重要方面。根据山西长治专区屯留、长子等六个县的统计，共有小粉坊一千七百七十九户，全年需玉茭、高粱等原料二千五百六十万斤，而生产的小粉面约等于粮食二千一百七十六万斤，另外能生产猪肉八十五万斤，产猪粪三百万担，够四十三万亩土地的用肥，能增产粮食一千万斤。这就是说，两相抵销，一年还可增产粮食六百一十六万斤，还净得了大量猪肉。因此，恢复副业生产，不仅是当前活跃初级市场的重要问题，也是发展农村经济的一项长期的重要的工作。
    在活跃初级市场和加强城乡物资交流的工作中，国营商店和合作社必须组织和领导私营商业，尽最大力量，加强向农村推销工业品和收购农产品、副业产品和土产特产。过去几年来，国营商业和合作社在开辟货源方面，更多地注意了工业产品的加工订货等等工作，这是完全必要的，而且在今后一个长的时期中，工业产品也还不能充分满足人民的需要，还必需不断地增加工业品的商品数量。需要总是走在生产的前面，这是社会主义的法则，也是刺激生产不断发展的动力。但是，我国工农业生产水平一下子还不能普遍提高，而人民在有了一定日用工业品后，还要求吃得更好一些，穿得更好一些。随着国家工业建设的发展，对出口土产和特产的要求也增加了。因此开辟农村货源就被提到重要的地位。农村中的许多产品只要善于组织调剂是可以解决不少问题的。
    为了大力开辟农村货源，国营商业和合作社除了自身的努力以外，还必须十分注意组织其它经济力量，发挥它们的作用。例如为了增加初级市场的商品，供应农民生产和生活的资料，认真组织发展手工业生产是十分重要的，各地供销合作社应该在这方面担负起主要的任务。为了沟通城乡物资，组织私商的力量也是必要的和可能的。私人商贩在目前还是一个较大的力量，完全否认他们在过渡时期的作用是不对的，是不利于国家经济生活的正常发展的。有些地方，对于粮食油料等项以外的物资，采用和私商下乡联购的办法，这是国家资本主义的一种形式，其他各地均可仿效。这种办法作好了，既可避免各种自发的活动，也有助于解决当前的需要。
    各级党委应该加强领导，向干部反复讲清粮食政策和商业政策，向群众进行深入的宣传教育，创造和运用正确的方式来活跃初级市场，加强城乡物资交流。只要我们的工作做好了，就一定能够完成当前的任务。
