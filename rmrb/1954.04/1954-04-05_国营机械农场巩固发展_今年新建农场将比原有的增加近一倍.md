State-Owned Mechanical Farms Consolidate and Develop
Number of Newly Built Farms This Year Will Nearly Double the Existing Number

[This newspaper dispatch] The national state-owned mechanized farms are consolidating and developing.

By 1953, there were already fifty-nine state-owned mechanized farms nationwide. In the past few years, these farms have trained more than 50,000 employees, more than 5,000 mechanical staff and tractor drivers, and produced more than 600 million jin of grain for the country (more than 200 million jin in 1953). They have improved production technology and increased the yield per unit area. In 1953, twenty-four farms were already profitable. The superiority displayed by mechanized production in the farms has provided farmers with vivid socialist education, induced farmers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and played a role in promoting the transformation of the small-peasant economy. In 1954, the number of state-owned mechanized farms will nearly double the existing number of farms. According to preliminary estimates, there is still wasteland in the country with about the same area as the current cultivated land, of which more than 300 to 400 million mu is arable. State-owned mechanized farms will gradually reclaim these wastelands and produce more grain for the country.

In 1953, the distribution of the fifty-nine state-owned mechanized farms was as follows: twenty-four in the Northeast, twelve in North China (including three farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture), eight each in East China and Central South, five in Northwest China, and one each in Southwest China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The crop situation was as follows: twenty-nine farms mainly growing wheat, twenty mainly growing rice, five mainly growing cotton, four mainly engaged in animal husbandry, and one mainly engaged in horticulture. In 1953, these farms cultivated more than 2 million mu of land in total. The cultivated land area of each farm was mostly more than 10,000 mu, with the largest having more than 200,000 mu. Most of the land cultivated by the farms was newly reclaimed wasteland. Many barren and poor lands, after several years of mechanical cultivation, construction of water conservancy projects, and soil improvement, have gradually become and will become fertile farmland.

In 1953, state-owned mechanized farms had 1,621 standard units of tractors of various types (calculated at 15 horsepower), 352 combines, and thousands of other agricultural machines and tools. The main operations of each farm are carried out by machines instead of human labor. Farms mainly engaged in wheat cultivation use machines from plowing and sowing to harvesting; farms mainly engaged in cotton and rice cultivation also use machines for plowing, harrowing, fertilizing, sowing, and some inter-tilling work. Because machines are used for production, the proportion of marketable grain produced by state-owned farms is very large. In 1953, mechanized farms in the Northeast (mostly in northern Manchuria) produced a total of 180 million jin of grain, with an average of more than five tons of grain produced per worker per year. Of the grain produced by these farms, in addition to seeds, rations, and feed, 76% of the grain was sold to the state as commodity grain, while the commodity grain sold to the state by local farmers accounted for only 35% of the grain produced.

Each farm uses machines for production and adopts scientific technology, so the yield per unit area is constantly increasing. In the past two or three years, the average yield per unit area of mechanized farms in North China, East China, and Central South regions has been 30% to 90% higher than that of local farmers. The wheat of the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, because of machine cultivation, close planting, and improved field management, the average yield per mu has increased from 106 jin in 1951 to more than 340 jin in 1953, which is more than twice the yield of wheat planted by nearby farmers with wide rows and large ridges (yield per mu of more than 100 jin). The state-owned Lutai Rice Farm adopted the method of direct dry seeding of rice (using machines to directly sow seeds in the ground, then releasing water, without manual transplanting) in 1952, sowing more than 12,000 mu of rice, with an average yield of more than 630 jin per mu; in 1953, the rice area was expanded, sowing more than 17,000 mu, and the average yield per mu reached more than 570 jin, which was double that of 1951 and about 50% higher than that of ordinary farmers nearby; the farm has also tested machine harvesting. This has opened up broad prospects for large-scale mechanized rice production in our country.

The superiority displayed by state-owned mechanized farms in production, the work of tilling the land on behalf of farmers in the vicinity of the farms, and other technical assistance have also improved the production of nearby farmers, and the farmers' thinking has undergone great changes, and they are actively demanding to take the road of collectivization. The first collective farm in our country, the Spark Collective Farm, was established with the help of the former state-owned Huachuan Farm (now changed to Huachuan Tractor Station); the Xinsheng Collective Farm on the fertile grassland of Nenjiang was also established with the help of the local Jiusan Veterans Farm. The farmers of these farms are now engaged in collectivized and mechanized production and live a prosperous and happy life. In the autumn of 1952, the Dongxin Farm used machines to till and plant land on behalf of the mutual aid teams in Wuguan Township nearby. The yield of wheat harvested last summer was doubled compared with the land cultivated by human and animal power. Therefore, last autumn, the land that the mutual aid teams requested the farm to till and plant on behalf of them has been expanded to more than 1,000 mu. The Guangbei Farm in Shandong and the Fangqiuhu Farm in Anhui have both tilled land on behalf of farmers, allowing farmers to see the benefits of collectivized and mechanized production and increasing the farmers' enthusiasm for organizing.

    国营机械农场巩固发展
    今年新建农场将比原有的增加近一倍
   【本报讯】全国国营机械化农场正在巩固和发展。
    全国到一九五三年已经有了五十九个国营机械化农场。这些农场在过去几年中，共培养了五万多职工，五千多个机务人员和拖拉机驾驶员，为国家生产了六亿多斤粮食（一九五三年为二亿多斤），改进了生产技术，提高了单位面积产量，在一九五三年并已有二十四个农场有了盈利。各农场机械化生产显示的优越性，给了农民以生动的社会主义教育，诱导农民积极参加互助合作运动，对改造小农经济起了推动作用。一九五四年，国营机械化农场，将比原有农场增加近一倍。据初步估计，全国还有和现在耕地面积差不多大的荒地，其中可耕荒地在三、四亿亩以上。国营机械化农场将逐渐在这些荒原上开垦，为国家生产更多的粮食。
    一九五三年，五十九个国营机械化农场的分布状况是：东北区二十四个，华北区十二个（包括中央农业部直属三个农场），华东区、中南区各八个，西北区五个，西南区、内蒙古自治区各一个；种植作物的情况是：以小麦为主的农场二十九个，水稻为主的二十个，以棉花为主的五个，畜牧为主的四个，园艺为主的一个。这些农场一九五三年共耕地二百多万亩，每个农场的耕地面积大多数在一万亩以上，最大的有二十多万亩。农场所耕土地，大部分是新开垦的荒地。许多荒芜贫瘠的土地，经过几年来的机械耕作，兴建水利和改良土壤，都已逐渐变成和将要变成肥沃的良田。
    国营机械化农场在一九五三年已有各种类型不同的拖拉机一千六百二十一标准台（以十五匹马力计算），康拜因三百五十二台，其他农业机器和农具数千件。各场主要作业，都用机器代替人力。以经营小麦为主的农场，从耕地、播种到收割，都使用了机器；以棉花、水稻为主的农场，耕地、耙地、施肥、播种和部分中耕工作，也都使用了机器。因为用机器进行生产，国营农场所生产的商品粮比重很大。东北区机械化农场（大部在北满）一九五三年共生产一亿八千万斤粮食，平均每个劳动力一年生产五吨多粮食。这些农场所生产的粮食，除种籽、口粮以及饲料以外，百分之七十六的粮食都以商品粮卖给了国家，而当地农民卖给国家的商品粮，却只占所产粮食的百分之三十五。
    各农场用机器生产又采用科学技术，因此单位面积产量不断提高。华北、华东、中南等地区的机械化农场在过去两、三年中，平均单位面积产量比当地农民高出百分之三十至九十。北京郊区国营双桥农场的小麦，因为用机器耕作，实行了密植，改进了田间管理，每亩平均产量已由一九五一年的一百零六斤提高到一九五三年的三百四十多斤，比附近农民宽行大垅种植的小麦（每亩产量一百多斤），产量高出二倍以上。国营芦台水稻农场，一九五二年采用水稻旱直播方法（用机器直接把种子播在地里，然后放水，不用人工插秧），播种水稻一万二千多亩，平均每亩产量达六百三十多斤；一九五三年扩大了水稻面积，播种一万七千多亩，平均每亩的产量达到五百七十多斤，比一九五一年提高一倍，比附近一般农民增产百分之五十左右；该农场并已试用机器收割。这就为我国水稻大面积机械化生产开辟了广阔的道路。
    国营机械化农场在生产上所显示的优越性，对农场附近农民土地的代耕工作和其他技术的援助，使附近农民的生产也提高了，农民的思想起了很大变化，积极要求走合作化的道路。我国的第一个集体农庄——星火集体农庄就是在前国营桦川农场
  （现改为桦川拖拉机站）的帮助下建立起来的；嫩江肥沃草原上的新生集体农庄，也是在当地九三荣军农场帮助下建立起来的。这些农庄的农民，现在已经实行集体化机械化的生产，过着富裕的幸福生活。东辛农场一九五二年秋季用机器为附近五官乡的互助组代耕代种，去年夏收小麦的产量比人畜力耕种的土地增加一倍，因此，去年秋季互助组要求农场代耕代种的土地已经扩大到一千多亩。山东广北农场、安徽方邱湖农场都因为给农民代耕土地，使农民看到了集体化和机械化生产的好处，提高了农民组织起来的积极性。
