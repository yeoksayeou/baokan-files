    Electric Welder
    —A Chronicle of the People Building Anshan
    By our reporter, Lu Hao
    On the winding, crisscrossing steam pipes, the sparks from the electric welding machine emitted a semi-blue, semi-green light in the darkness. It was past two in the morning, and the pipe welding project was still underway.
    The electric welding machine used by welder He Shanshu worked non-stop with a constant "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh" sound. He was intently overhead welding the seam underneath the pipe. He was lying on a scaffold board, which was at least five zhang (over 16 meters) above the ground. The safety belt around his waist was tied to the scaffolding, making him seem as if he were suspended in mid-air.
    The biting northwest wind seemed to penetrate his cotton-padded coat and vest. As he was about to finish welding the second welding rod, he suddenly felt a bit hot, but the intense concentration required by the welding work demanded that he not think about anything else.
    As he welded, he suddenly felt his chin getting a bit hot, and an unpleasant, foul-smelling smoke entered his nostrils. He sensed something was wrong and immediately put down the welding machine. Looking at himself, he realized that the iron splash from the welding had burned his cotton vest, and the fire was spreading upwards towards his chest.
    At this moment, he was facing north, and the burning vest had already started to smoke, with sparks flying directly from the northwest wind.
    The sudden misfortune made He Shanshu feel scared for the first time. It wasn't that he was afraid of being burned to death or any other unfortunate event. He saw that all around him were the scaffolding and planks needed for working in the air. He couldn't simply take off the burning vest or beat at it, because if any sparks fell and ignited the dry wood, it would be a major disaster. If the scaffolding and planks were burned down, the welding work would be halted, and it would immediately affect the iron tapping of the blast furnace.
    He quickly turned his body towards the south to prevent the northwest wind from spreading the fire on his cotton vest. Then, he curled up his body and rubbed the sparking cotton vest with his hands, enduring the pain. He was determined to extinguish the fire on his burning vest in this way.
    Although he felt hot all over, his hands were painfully burned, and the foul smoke irritated his eyes, causing them to tear, he persevered and extinguished the fire on his cotton vest with his own hands. When the sparks and foul smoke had all disappeared, blisters had formed on both hands, and his blackened fingers seemed to have been charred. Most of the front of the cotton vest had been burned, and there was also a hole burned in his trousers.
    Squad leader Wang Fushun was passing below when he noticed there was no electric light on the pipe. He shouted, "He Shanshu, how is it up there?"
    "The vest just got two holes burned in it, it's nothing," He Shanshu replied. "Squad leader, leave the leather vest for me."
    He Shanshu came down, put on the leather vest, and climbed back up to the pipe to continue working.
    The pipeline project was becoming more urgent step by step. The welding work continued day and night.
    He Shanshu and the welders had been working continuously for four days and nights. Not long after taking off the burned cotton vest, he and Lü Zhendong started a competition with the pipe fitters.
    "For every one you fit, we guarantee to weld one, dare to try?"
    Seeing that there were only two of them, the pipe fitters said, "Don't brag. Electric welding has never kept up with us."
    "That's right, then let's compete."
    There were eight or nine pipe fitters. For every one they fitted, He Shanshu and Lü Zhendong would weld one. Later on, before the pipe fitters had even finished fitting, they were already waiting nearby.
    This chased the pipe fitters to the point where they said, "In the past, we were always waiting for you, but now you're too fast."
    Sometimes, they had to wait for a very long time. The pipe fitters felt a little embarrassed and said to He Shanshu, "Why don't you go to sleep for a while? We'll call you when we're done."
    Old Lü also said, "Let's take a nap and come back. I bet they won't be done fitting yet."
    "No way," He Shanshu said to Old Lü, "We'll chase them for every one they fit. Chasing them like this will make the work go faster."
    And so, on the fourth night, they finally completed the welding of the steam pipes.
    The task was completed, and they were indeed exhausted. For those four days and nights, they rested for no more than an hour or two each day, and they didn't even bother to eat. When they were hungry, they just asked someone to bring back a few fried dough twists from the canteen. The leading comrades wanted them to go to sleep, but after a while, they started working again themselves.
    Once the continuous hard work stopped, problems that they didn't care about before became even more serious. The smoke emitted by the welding rods made people dizzy, and even the phlegm they coughed up was blackish-yellow. It felt like there was sand in their eyes, grinding and pricking. Their eyeballs were swollen and throbbing, and it hurt severely.
    There were too few welding machines and not enough manpower. Even with constant work day and night, the heavy tasks still could not be completed.
    At this time, Soviet experts suggested to the leaders of the metal structure company that they promote the short-arc rapid welding method.
    On the first day of the rapid welding method experiment, eighteen people volunteered to participate in the study.
    But by the second day, four or five people were gone. Because some people felt that this short-arc welding method had nothing new to offer. They were unwilling to give up their old methods, and they didn't believe that this new welding method could improve work efficiency. They said, "It's just a different trick, how can it be faster?"
    As time went on, even fewer people came. Because some people, at first glance, thought it was easy, but when they started learning, they couldn't learn it, and as a result, they lost heart. After a week, only He Shanshu and two other old welders—Song Deyou and Qi Keliang—were left.
    In the end, Qi Keliang also lost confidence in learning. He said to Old He, "The work is too tight, I have to go to work." In fact, he felt that this thing looked easy, but how could he never get it right? He thought, how long will it take to learn if I spend so much time on it? There's no end in sight, forget it.
    Qi Keliang left, leaving only He Shanshu and Song Deyou.
    He Shanshu said, "No matter what, we must be determined to learn it."
    "Yes, we must persevere," Song Deyou said.
    This learning was, of course, also very difficult for He Shanshu. He remembered the situation when he learned electric welding in Dalian a few years ago. At that time, because he was using Soviet welding rods for the first time and was not familiar with their performance, the molten iron was thin and the sparks were large. Not only were his new white canvas work clothes burned full of soybean-sized holes, but even the innermost shirt was burned through. That was in the freezing winter, and after all the clothes were burned through, they had to stagger the holes in their clothes to barely cover their skin, and then apply seawater to their work clothes. Only after fifteen days of hard study did they master the general welding techniques of overhead and vertical welding. Now, when he especially thought about how much the heavy work needed rapid welding, his study became even more determined, and he concentrated all his energy on this learning.
    He Shanshu and Song Deyou were finally the first to master the short-arc rapid welding method, and then this advanced method of operation was quickly promoted among all the electric welders. And when welding the steam pipes leading to the large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, this rapid welding method especially showed its excellent achievements.
    On the eve of the start-up of the large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, the pipeline project was at its most critical stage. On this day, the steam pipes extending from the power plant had to be connected to the pipes leading to the new project. These welding tasks strictly required that they all be completed on time within the five hours of steam outage.
    The excellent welders He Shanshu and Lü Zhendong once again jointly shouldered this important responsibility.
    At 1:20 p.m. that day, the steam was stopped on time. Originally, the pipe workers were prepared to align the pipe openings beforehand so that the welding work could begin immediately after the steam was stopped. But as a result, the steam was stopped, but the pipe openings could not be aligned no matter what. If the top was aligned, the bottom was left over, and if the bottom was right, the top was too much. After aligning back and forth, they were more than twenty millimeters off.
    People looked anxiously at their watches, counting the time minute by minute. An hour passed; two hours passed, but the welding work could not begin. It was not until more than three hours later, when it was already dark, that the pipe openings were aligned.
    The pipe was located in a ditch more than one meter deep, and the bottom of the ditch was filled with water and mud. As soon as He Shanshu and Lü Zhendong saw that the pipe was aligned, they immediately jumped into the ditch, lay next to the thick pipes, and began to work.
    Welding work was being carried out tensely in the ditch, and the people standing on the ditch were staring fixedly at the second hand moving on the watch.
    Besides the whirring sound of the welding machine, the only sound was the question from people without watches: "How much time is left? How much time is left?"
      "One thirty."
    "One twenty."…
    "How much time is left? How much time is left?"
    "Fifty-five minutes."
    Just as someone answered "Fifty minutes left," He Shanshu and Lü Zhendong had already stood up from the ditch.
    The thin mud in the ditch had soaked half of their cotton clothes, and their hair and mud were clumped together. Their faces, even their ears, were covered with mud. As soon as they stood up, they asked, "How much time is left? How much time is left?"
    Huang, the manager of the pipeline engineering company, quickly walked over and shook hands with them. He replied, "Comrades, you have won, you have won! Congratulations on completing the task fifty minutes ahead of schedule."
    It was not until the huge steam flow safely passed through the pipes they had welded that He Shanshu realized that several places on his cotton coat had long been soaked by the ice water in the ditch.

    电焊工
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者　陆灏
    在蜿蜒的纵横交错的蒸气管道上，电焊机迸飞着的火花在黑夜里放射出一种半蓝半绿的颜色。这是早晨两点多钟，焊接管道的工程正在继续进行。
    电焊工贺善述使用的电焊机片刻不停地呜呜呜地工作着，他正在聚精会神地仰焊管道底下的那条焊缝。他躺在跳板上，那跳板至少离地有五丈多高。腰里系着的安全带结在脚手架上，人好像被悬挂在半空中一样。
    凛冽的西北风好像把他身上的棉袄和棉坎肩都穿透了。在他将要焊完第二根焊条的时候，他忽然觉得身上有些发热，可是焊接工作的高度紧张，要求他精神集中到什么也不能思想。
    他焊着焊着，忽然间他的下巴感到有点发烫，一股难闻的臭烟冒进了他的鼻孔，他觉得事情不好，立刻放下了电焊机，往自己的身上一看，原来是身上的棉坎肩被电焊的铁水烧着了，而且正在从下面延烧到胸前来。
    这时他正面朝北边，烧着的坎肩已开始冒烟，并被西北风吹得直迸火星。
    突然发生的祸事使贺善述第一次感到害怕起来。他倒并不是害怕自己会被烧死或发生什么其他不幸的事情，他看到自己的身边，都是空中作业所需要的脚手架和跳板，这烧着了的棉坎肩既不能随便脱下来，也不能拍打，因为万一有掉下来的火星烧着了这些干燥的木头，那就要闯下大祸了。脚手架和跳板如果被烧毁，就要使焊接工作停顿下来，而且会马上影响到高炉的出铁。
    他自己迅速地把身子朝向南边，不让这西北风把棉坎肩上的火蔓延起来，然后团起自己的身体，两只手忍疼揉着有火星的棉坎肩。他决心用这个办法来扑灭燃烧着的棉坎肩上的火。
    虽然是全身感到热呼呼，两只手被灼得痛苦难受，眼睛被冒着的臭烟刺得掉泪；但他毕竟坚持着用双手揉熄了他的棉坎肩上的火。当火星、臭烟一切都消失的时候，他的两只手上已起了泡，乌黑的手指也好像被烤焦了，棉坎肩的前胸大部分已被烧完，裤子上也被烧了一个洞。
    班长王福顺正从下边走过，见管道上没有电光。他就喊：“贺善述，上边怎么样？”
    “刚才坎肩上烧了两个窟窿，没有什么。”贺善述回答说：“班长，你把皮坎肩留给我吧。”
    贺善述下来穿上了皮坎肩，他又爬上管道继续工作起来。
    管道工程一步比一步紧张。焊接工程昼夜不停地进行。
    贺善述和焊工们已经是连续工作到第四个昼夜了。被烧掉的棉坎肩刚刚脱去不久，他和吕振东两个人又和配管工人开始了一场比赛。
    “你们对一个，我们保证焊一个，你们敢吗？”
    配管工人一见他们只有两个人，说：“别吹了，电焊从来没有赶过我们的。”
    “对，那就比比看吧。”
    配管工人共有八九个，他们对好一个，贺善述和吕振东就焊好一个。到了后来，不等配管工人对好，他们又早就等在旁边了。
    这一下，追得配管工人们直说：“过去我们光等你们，你们现在赶得太快了。”
    有时候，简直要等很长的时间，配管工人们有点不大好意思，便对贺善述说：“你们先去睡一会吧，对好了，我们就去叫你们。”
    老吕也说：“我们去打个盹再来，保险他们还对不好。”
    “不行。”贺善述对老吕说：“他们对一个，我们追一个，这样追着他们，就能使工作进行得更快些。”
    就这样，他们在第四个晚上，终于把蒸气管道的焊接工作完成了。
    任务是完成了，他们也的确累得精疲力尽了。这四个昼夜，他们每天休息不过个把钟头，连饭也顾不得吃，肚子饿了，只是托人从食堂带几根麻花回来。领导同志要他们去睡觉，过了一会，他们自己又干起来了。
    连日劳累的工作一旦停止下来，本来觉得不在乎的问题反倒加倍严重起来。那焊条散发的烟，把人薰得晕头晕脑，连吐的痰都是黑黄色的，眼里头好像夹着砂子，磨着，扎着；眼珠子发胀，弓来弓去，痛得厉害。
    电焊机少，人力不足，那怕是日日夜夜不断地工作，严重的任务还是无法完成。
    正在这时候，苏联专家向金属结构公司的领导上提出了推行短弧快速焊法的建议。
    在快速焊法试验的第一天，自动报名参加学习的有十八个人。
    但到第二天，就少了四五个人。因为有的人看这短弧焊法没有什么新玩艺儿，他们不愿意丢掉自己的老手法，也不相信这新的焊接法能提高工作效率。他们说：“不过换了个花样，怎么会快呢。”
    时间长一些，人来得更少了。因为有些人，初看觉得容易，但学起来，又学不会，结果就泄气了。一个星期以后，只剩下贺善述和另外两个老焊工——宋德有和齐克良了。
    到最后，齐克良也没有信心学下去了。他给老贺说：“活太紧，我得干活去。”实际上，他觉得看来挺容易的玩艺儿，怎么老弄不准呢。他想，费了那么长时间，什么时候才能学会，没有个头，算了吧。
    齐克良走了，只剩贺善述和宋德有两个人了。
    贺善述说：“无论怎样，一定要决心学会它。”
    “对，咱们一定坚持下去。”宋德有说。
    这次学习对贺善述来说，当然也是很困难的。他想起前几年在大连学电焊的情形。那时候，他因为第一次用苏联的焊条操作，对它的性能不熟悉，铁水稀，火星大，新的白帆布的工作服烧满了黄豆大的窟窿还不算，甚至最里层的衬衣也给烧破了。那是滴水成冰的冬天，所有的衣裳全被烧破以后，他们只好把衣裳上的窟窿交错开来，勉强盖住皮肤，然后再把海水敷在作业服上，经过了十五天的艰苦学习，才算掌握了一般的仰焊、立焊的焊接技术。现在当他特别想到繁重的工作多么需要快速焊接法的时候，他的学习就更加坚定了，他把自己全部的精力都集中在这一次学习上。
    贺善述和宋德有终于最先掌握了短弧快速焊法，接着，这个先进的操作方法很快就在全体电焊工人中推广开来。而在焊接通向大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的蒸汽管道的时候，这种快速焊接法就特别显示了它的优异的成就。
    在大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂开工的前夕，管道工程处于最紧张的阶段。这一天，从发电厂延伸出来的蒸汽管道，要和通向新工程的管道衔接起来，这些焊接工作严格要求在五小时蒸汽停气时间内全部按时完成。
    优秀的电焊工贺善述和吕振东两个人，又一次共同担负了这重大的责任。
    当天下午一点二十分，蒸汽按时停止了，原来准备管道工人事前把管道口对好，蒸汽一停止，焊接工作就马上开始。但结果蒸汽是停止了，管道口却怎么也对不上，上边对齐了下边剩，下边合适了，上边又多出来，对来对去，相差二十多公厘。
    人们焦灼地看着表，一分钟一分钟地计算着时间。一个钟头过去了；两个钟头过去了，焊接工作还不能开始，一直到三个多钟头以后，天已经黑了，管道口才算对上。
    这管道正座落在一条一人多深的地沟里，沟底里是积水和灰泥。贺善述和吕振东两人一见管道对好，他们便马上跳进了地沟，躺在粗大的管道的旁边，开始工作起来。
    沟下正紧张地进行焊接工作，站在沟上的人，两只眼睛死死地盯住手表上面走动着的秒针。
    除了电焊机响着呜呜呜的声音以外，唯一的声音就是没有带表的人询问：“还剩多少时间？还剩多少时间？”
      “一点三十分。”
    “一点二十分。”……
    “还剩多少时间？还剩多少时间？”
    “五十五分。”
    刚刚有人回答完“还剩五十分”，贺善述和吕振东，已经从地沟里站起来了。
    地沟里的稀薄的灰泥，把他们两个人的半边的棉衣都浸湿了，头发和灰泥团成了疙瘩，脸上，甚至是耳朵里，也沾满了灰泥。他们刚站起来，就问：“还有多少时间？还有多少时间？”
    管道工程公司的黄经理赶紧走过来和他们握手。他回答说：“同志们胜利了，胜利了，庆祝你们提前五十分钟完成了任务。”
    一直等到巨大的蒸汽气流安全地流过了他们焊接的管道的时候，贺善述才发觉自己的棉袄好几个地方早已被地沟里的冰水浸透了。
