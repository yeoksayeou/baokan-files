Soviet "Pravda"
    "Pravda" published an article on the 10th commenting on foreign newspapers, entitled "Asian Peoples Demand the Restoration of China's Legitimate Rights in the United Nations." The author, L. Delyusin, pointed out that articles have recently appeared constantly in Asian newspapers, publishing talks by prominent social figures, demanding the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    Delyusin wrote: The demand of the Asian peoples to end the barbaric situation of not allowing the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations is so certain and firm that some Western governments that usually follow American policy can no longer ignore this issue. These countries have begun to suggest to the United States that it is time to abandon the policy of non-recognition of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China.
    Delyusin pointed out that the policy of isolating China, formulated by stubbornly refusing to consider the great changes that have taken place in Asia since World War II, has backfired on the planners and instigators of this policy. Asian public opinion openly expresses indignation at the policies pursued by the United States. The "Indian Times" published in Delhi pointed out that the US policy does not conform to reality when it wrote: "Washington will eventually realize that the policy of isolating Red China will result in the United States being isolated."
    Delyusin continued: Starting from peace and justice, the Asian peoples have consistently worked hard to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. Their voices are becoming more and more resolute. Whether it is political activists or mass organizations, they are all supporting this demand. For example, Indian Prime Minister Nehru has more than once demanded that the People's Republic of China obtain a legitimate position in the United Nations. The resolution passed by the Indonesian National Peace Conference not long ago stated: "The United Nations must have the People's Republic of China, which represents a quarter of the world's population, participate." Indonesian parliament Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Rendunou and other political activists also made similar demands.
    Delyusin concluded: The voices of the Asian peoples are getting louder and louder. Not listening to this voice is to pursue a policy that is divorced from reality and will inevitably go bankrupt. The legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored.

    Soviet "New Times"
    A recent issue of the magazine "New Times" published an article by M. Ukraintsev, entitled "The Thriving People's China."
    The article said that the People's Republic of China has been established for less than five years, but its economic and cultural development is something that many other Asian countries can only dream of today. In China, no government has ever enjoyed such high prestige and received such enthusiastic support from all strata of the people as the Central People's Government.
    The failure of the economic blockade forcibly implemented by the United States powerfully proves the strength of the People's Government. This blockade has instead hit its initiators and the countries that obeyed American orders. China has established close economic ties with the Soviet Union, the European People's Democratic countries, and some neighboring countries in Asia, and is victoriously developing its economy. As for those countries that have reduced trade with China, such as Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, and some Southeast Asian countries, the economic blockade has caused them considerable losses. Many capitalist countries are trying to establish trade relations with the People's Republic of China, regardless of the US ban.
    One of the main goals of implementing the economic blockade was to isolate the People's Republic of China in the international arena. But this goal has not been achieved either. Economic progress, the consolidation of the people's democratic system, and a consistent foreign policy have greatly enhanced China's prestige and strengthened China's influence in international affairs. Twenty-five countries with a population of approximately one billion have already established or are establishing diplomatic relations with it.
    The article said that world opinion welcomes the decision to hold the Geneva Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China on an equal footing with other major powers. Everywhere in the world, this decision is considered a victory for common sense, because it is obvious that in the current situation, no important Asian issue can be resolved without the participation of Chinese representatives. At the same time, this decision is regarded as recognizing that the People's Republic of China is one of the major powers that bears primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.
    However, some people in the United States are still clinging to their old policy of "non-recognition." Dulles' speech to the New York Overseas Press Club on March 29 specifically illustrates this point. The main spirit of his speech was to hate the People's Republic of China and stubbornly refuse to face the cold facts.
    The article pointed out: The policy of the US imperialists seems to be based on the assumption that the fate of the Asian people depends on the will of the colonial countries. However, those days are gone forever. Today, in the mid-20th century, implementing this policy is at least showing a complete lack of understanding of the actual situation in the world. Today, there is no force in the world that can force the Asian people to abandon the path of freedom and national independence. China is resolutely following this path, and the tremendous changes that have taken place in China cannot be canceled. The People's Republic of China is confidently heading towards new victories in domestic and international affairs.

    Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 11th entitled "The People's Republic of China is a Great Country," saying: The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are one of the greatest historical events in international life in recent years. In the four and a half years since its establishment, the new China has achieved rapid development in politics, economy, and culture. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are moving towards the great goal of socialism. The growth of the political and economic strength of the People's Republic of China has rapidly enhanced its international prestige, and today it has appeared on the international stage as a great power.
    The editorial pointed out: Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has carried out resolute struggles to safeguard world peace and the interests of all nations. In particular, during the three-year-long Korean War, the great Chinese people, under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, fought alongside the heroic Korean people to defeat the common enemy, the American armed aggressors, and made a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world.
    The editorial emphasized: The international status of the great People's Republic of China is undeniable. People have clearly realized that the problem of ensuring international peace and security cannot be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China in the discussion. Precisely for this reason, the voice of the people of the world demanding respect for the status of the People's Republic of China as one of the five major powers is rising further. This fully proves that the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is further increasing. Therefore, it is only natural that the People's Republic of China, as one of the five major powers, should participate in the Geneva Conference together with other relevant countries.
    The editorial then pointed out: However, the American warmongers who are afraid of peace and unwilling to ease international tensions are obstructing the People's Republic of China from exercising its legitimate rights as a major power in the United Nations agencies and other international organizations. Recently, Dulles even arrogantly distorted and attacked the international status and rights of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference. However, this action by the American warmongers cannot diminish the international status and legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, which is supported by hundreds of millions of people around the world.
    The editorial concluded: All the Korean people and the people of all countries in the world are convinced that the People's Republic of China, as one of the five major powers, will play a great role in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the cessation of the bloody war in Indochina at the Geneva Conference. The people of China and Korea, who are guarding the outpost of peace in Asia like a wall of iron, will unite more strongly and carry out a more resolute struggle for the great cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    British "Britain-China Friendship Association"
    The annual meeting of the "Britain-China Friendship Association" was held in London on April 10.
    Association Secretary-General Deribang said in his report: "Facts have proved that the people of the entire Britain are extremely sympathetic and supportive of the Chinese people and admire their achievements; people's desire to strengthen friendship with China and restore normal trade relations with China is also increasing."
    The report continued: "World problems, including those in the Far East, cannot be resolved if a quarter of the world's population is not allowed to join the United Nations and participate in consultations. Regardless of how the United States and its supporters oppose it, we must fight to get China admitted to the United Nations and recognized as a major power in the world in order to achieve and maintain peace."
    Deribang also called for expanding Sino-British trade.
    The famous progressive journalist Gordon Schaffer then spoke. He sharply criticized the US foreign policy. Referring to Dulles's trip to London and Paris, Schaffer pointed out that Dulles's purpose was "to drag France and Britain into the US war plan in the Far East."
    The meeting passed a resolution "expressing deep concern about Dulles's open claim that the United States would intensify its intervention in the Indochina War. ...The meeting urged the British government to support the final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, to support a ceasefire in Indochina, and to admit China to the United Nations."
    The meeting also passed a resolution requesting the British government to "lift the ban on trade with China."

    French "France-China Friendship Association"
    People from all walks of life in France are demanding the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between France and the People's Republic of China. This demand was particularly evident at the meeting of the France-China Friendship Association on April 6.
    Textile entrepreneur René said at the meeting: Establishing economic ties between France and the People's Republic of China would greatly benefit France. Professor Nère pointed out in his speech the danger to France of the US plan to expand the war in Southeast Asia. He said that the French people must more resolutely demand an end to the Indochina War, because this war "is bankrupting our country and making our country a slave." Storas, secretary of the France-China Friendship Association, said that establishing normal relations between France and China is a wise and far-sighted action and is in line with the wishes of the majority of the French people.
    The meeting passed a resolution stating: "Representatives of all strata of residents in Paris firmly demand that the French government and parliament take measures, first of all, to recognize the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China, in order to guarantee the success of the Geneva Conference."

    American "Peace Crusade"
    The New York "Worker's Daily" reported: On April 3, the American Peace Crusade organized a mass rally in Chicago to strive for trade and peace with China. More than 500 Chicago citizens attended the rally. The main speaker of the conference was Ms. Russell, who emphasized the "amazing progress of China's economy and culture, and the unwavering peace policy of Chinese leaders." She pointed out the importance of mutually beneficial trade and cooperation between China and the American people for the struggle for world peace. Another speaker was union staffer Albert Veri.
    The meeting telegraphed Dulles and Eisenhower, requesting them to abandon the policy of relying on force and hydrogen bombs as tools of national policy, to conduct sincere negotiations at the Geneva Conference to seek peace in Korea and Indochina, and to reach an agreement on stopping the Cold War and eliminating the threat posed by hydrogen bombs.

### 世界各国舆论要求在国际事务中恢复人民中国的合法权利和地位

    世界各国舆论要求在国际事务中恢复人民中国的合法权利和地位
    苏联“真理报”
    “真理报”在十日刊载了一篇外国报纸述评，题目是“亚洲各国人民要求恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利”。作者列·杰柳辛指出，在亚洲各国的报纸上最近不断出现了一些文章，刊载了一些著名社会人士的谈话，要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
    杰柳辛写道：亚洲各国人民要求终止蛮横地不让中华人民共和国进入联合国的情况，这种要求是如此肯定和坚决，以致使一些通常追随美国政策的西方国家政府也不能再不考虑这一问题了。这些国家已开始向美国提出：现在是收起不承认中华人民共和国合法权利的政策的时候了。
    杰柳辛指出，由于顽固地不愿考虑第二次世界大战后亚洲所发生的伟大的变化而制订出来的孤立中国的政策，打着了这一政策的策划者和鼓动者自己。亚洲舆论对美国所执行的方针公开表示愤慨。德里出版的“印度时报”指出美国的政策不符合现实时写道：“华盛顿最后总会明白，孤立红色中国的政策结果将使美国孤立。”
    杰柳辛接着写道：亚洲各国人民从和平与正义出发，始终不懈地为恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利而努力。他们的呼声是越来越坚决了。不论是政治活动家还是群众团体，都在支持这一要求。例如印度总理尼赫鲁就不止一次地要求使中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位。在不久以前举行的印尼全国和平大会通过的决议中写道：“联合国必须有代表世界四分之一人口的中华人民共和国参加。”印尼国会外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌和其他一些政治活动家也提出了类似的要求。
    杰柳辛最后写道：亚洲各国人民的呼声越来越响亮了。不倾听这种呼声，那就是在推行一个脱离现实和不可避免将遭到破产的政策。中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利是必须恢复的。
      苏联“新时代”
    最近一期的“新时代”杂志登载了麦·乌克兰采夫的一篇文章，题目是“欣欣向荣的人民中国”。
    文章说，中华人民共和国成立还不到五年，然而它的经济和文化发展却是今天其他许多亚洲国家只能梦想的。在中国，从来没有任何一个政府像中央人民政府那样，享有这样高的威望和得到各阶层人民这样热烈的支持。
    美国强制实行的经济封锁的失败有力地证明了人民政府的力量。这次封锁反而打击了它的发起人和听从美国命令的国家。中国和苏联、欧洲人民民主国家及亚洲的若干邻国建立了紧密的经济联系，正在胜利地发展它的经济。至于减少了对中国的贸易的那些国家如英国、法国、西德、日本和某些东南亚国家，经济封锁使它们受到了不小的损失。许多资本主义国家正在不顾美国的禁止，设法和中华人民共和国建立贸易关系。
    实行经济封锁的主要目标之一是在国际舞台上孤立中华人民共和国。但是这个目标也没有达到。经济上的进步、人民民主制度的巩固以及始终一贯的外交政策，大大提高了中国的威望，加强了中国在国际事务中的影响。拥有大约十亿人口的二十五个国家已经或者正在与它建立外交关系。
    文章说，世界舆论欢迎关于举行有中华人民共和国在和其他大国平等的基础上参加的日内瓦会议的决议。世界各处都认为这个决议是常识的胜利，因为十分明显，在目前情况下如果没有中国代表参加，任何重要亚洲问题都不可能得到解决。同时，这个决议被认为是承认中华人民共和国是对维护国际和平与安全负有主要责任的大国之一。
    但是，美国某些人士仍然死死抱住他们的“不予承认”的老政策。杜勒斯三月二十九日在纽约海外记者俱乐部发表的演说就具体地说明了这一点。他的演说的主要精神就是仇视中华人民共和国和顽固地拒绝面对冷酷的事实。
    文章指出：美帝国主义者的政策所根据的似乎是这样一种假定，就是亚洲人民的命运取决于殖民国家的意志。但是，这种日子已经一去不复返了，现在，在二十世纪中叶，执行这种政策，至少是显示出完全不了解世界的实际情况。今天世界上没有任何力量可以迫使亚洲人民放弃自由和民族独立的道路。中国正在坚决地走着这条道路，中国发生的巨大变化是取消不了的。中华人民共和国正满怀信心地走向国内和国际事务中的新的胜利。
      朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”十一日以“中华人民共和国是伟大的国家”为题发表社论说：中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，是近年来国际生活中的一个最伟大的历史事件。新中国从成立以来的四年半期间，在政治、经济、文化上都获得了飞跃的发展。现在，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，向着伟大的社会主义目标迈进。中华人民共和国的政治和经济力量的成长，迅速地提高了它的国际威信，在今天，它已经以一个伟大的强国的面貌出现在国际舞台上。
    社论指出：中华人民共和国成立以来，就为维护世界和平和各民族的利益，进行了坚决的斗争。特别是在历时三年的朝鲜战争中，伟大的中国人民在抗美援朝的旗帜下，与英雄的朝鲜人民一起，打败了共同的敌人美国武装侵略者，对亚洲及世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    社论强调指出：伟大的中华人民共和国的国际地位是不可抹杀的。人们都已清楚地认识到，保障国际和平与安全的问题如果没有中华人民共和国参加讨论，是不能得到解决的。正因为如此，全世界人民要求尊重中华人民共和国作为五大国之一的地位的呼声，正在进一步高涨。这充分证明中华人民共和国的国际威信正在进一步提高。因此，中华人民共和国作为五大国之一和其他有关国家一起参加日内瓦会议，是理所当然的。
    社论接着指出：但是，害怕和平、不愿意缓和国际紧张局势的美国好战分子们，竟在联合国机构和其他国际机构中，阻挠中华人民共和国作为一个大国来行使其合法的权利。最近，杜勒斯竟狂妄地对中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上的国际地位和权利进行恶意歪曲和攻击。但是，美国好战分子的这种行动，是丝毫也不能减损受到全世界亿万人民支持的中华人民共和国的国际地位和合法权利的。
    社论最后说：全体朝鲜人民和全世界各国人民确信，中华人民共和国作为五大国之一，将在日内瓦会议和平解决朝鲜问题和中止印度支那的流血战争方面起巨大的作用。铜墙铁壁般地守护着亚洲和平前哨的朝中两国人民，为了亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业，将更加坚强地团结在一起进行更坚决的斗争。
    英国“英中友好协会”
      “英中友好协会”年会于四月十日在伦敦举行。
    协会秘书长德里邦在报告中说：“有事实证明，全英国人民都极为同情和支持中国人民，并且钦佩他们的成就；人们对于加强与中国的友谊以及和中国恢复正常贸易关系的愿望也日趋强烈。”
    报告继续说：“假使不让世界四分之一的人口加入联合国和参与协商的话，世界问题，包括远东问题在内，是不可能得到解决的。不管美国和它的支持者如何反对，我们必须为争取接纳中国加入联合国并争取承认它为世界的一个大国而斗争，以取得和维护和平。”
    德里邦还要求扩大英中贸易。
    著名的进步新闻工作者戈登·夏菲尔接着发言。他尖锐地抨击了美国的外交政策。夏菲尔在谈到杜勒斯的伦敦和巴黎之行时指出，杜勒斯此行的目的“是想把法国和英国拖入美国在远东的战争计划中去”。
    会议通过了一项决议，“对于杜勒斯公然扬言美国要加紧干预印度支那战争一事深表忧虑。……会议敦促英国政府在日内瓦会议上支持朝鲜问题的最后和平解决，支持印度支那的停火以及接纳中国加入联合国。”
    会议还通过了一项决议，要求英国政府“取消对和中国贸易的禁令”。
      法国“法中友好协会”
    法国各界人士要求建立法国和中华人民共和国的正常外交关系。这种要求在法中友好协会四月六日召开的会议上特别表现了出来。
    纺织企业家列涅在会上说：法国和中华人民共和国建立经济联系，将使法国得到很大的好处。奈尔教授在发言中指出美国在东南亚扩大战争的计划对法国的危险性。他说，法国人民必须更坚决地要求停止印度支那战争，因为这个战争“使我们国家破产并使我们国家沦为奴仆”。法中友好协会秘书斯托拉斯说，法国和中国建立正常关系，是一种明智的、有远见的行动，而且符合于大多数法国人民的愿望。
    会议通过决议说：“巴黎各阶层居民的代表坚决要求法国政府和议会采取措施，首先是承认中华人民共和国的合法政府，以保证日内瓦会议成功。”
    美国“和平十字军”
    纽约“工人日报”报道：四月三日，美国和平十字军在芝加哥组织了一个争取与中国贸易及和平的群众集会。参加集会的有五百多芝加哥市民。大会的主要演讲人是鲁塞尔女士，她强调指出了“中国经济与文化的惊人进步，以及中国领袖们的坚定不移的和平政策”。她指出中国和美国人民之间的互利贸易与合作对于争取世界和平的斗争的重要意义。另外一个演讲人是工会工作人员艾伯特·维里。
    集会致电杜勒斯与艾森豪威尔，要求放弃依靠武力和氢弹作为国家政策工具的政策，要求在日内瓦会议上进行诚恳地谈判以谋求朝鲜与印度支那的和平，并要求在停止冷战及消除氢弹所造成的威胁上取得协议。　（据新华社讯）
