International Public Opinion Opposes US Assembling an Aggression Bloc in Southeast Asia
Exposing the Colonial Nature of US Policy

Soviet "Izvestia"
    "Izvestia" published an article by V. Kudryavtsev on the 20th, commenting on the conspiracy behind the US plan to establish an Asian military bloc. He pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, suggested establishing a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific similar to the North Atlantic Group. This fact itself proves once again that certain people in the United States are not only not working to create conditions for a peaceful settlement of Asian issues, but are frantically taking measures to expand the Indochina War and increase tensions in Asia and the world situation. The article said: The purpose of the United States' assembling of a Pacific military bloc is to suppress the national liberation movement of the Asian people, maintain the colonial rule of imperialist countries in Asian countries, and step up the squeezing out of its competitors.
    The article went on to write: However, the wishful thinking of the US aggressive bloc has not taken into account the will of the true masters of Asia - the people of Asian countries. India’s "National Herald" pointed out that the United States "insists on interfering in other people's affairs." The newspaper wrote that the people of Southeast Asian countries should decide for themselves whether they need the kind of freedom enjoyed by the Chinese people, or the kind of "freedom" that exists in Indochina, Malaya and Kenya. The Colombo "Train News" in Ceylon pointed out that the people of Asian countries "are deeply convinced that the United States is constantly pursuing a policy of aggression."
    Kudryavtsev finally wrote: Many such statements prove that the US ruling group, in planning the establishment of a Southeast Asian military bloc, has forgotten that they are not dealing with an old and backward Asia, but a new Asia that is rising up to fight for national liberation. The initial response to Dulles's proposal to establish a military bloc in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific has already shown that this proposal cannot expect any support from the people of Asian countries.

French "Humanité"
    Pierre Goudard published a commentary in the Paris "Humanité" on the 16th, exposing the colonial nature of the "Pacific Pact" that Dulles wants to put together.
    The commentary said: After Dulles left Paris, the French, British, and American talks aimed at formulating the strategy of the Western countries at the Geneva Conference began in Paris. A handful of French Foreign Ministry officials responsible for implementing the sabotage strategy formulated by Dulles represented France in this meeting. In fact, this is to bring the Geneva Conference to a deadlock, so as to finally prove that the conclusion of the "Pacific Pact" is reasonable, and this pact can "legalize" the "internationalization" of the Indochina War.
    The commentary said: However, all conspiracies cannot stop the real issues from being raised at the Geneva Conference. If the Western countries evade these issues, they will be condemned by the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia. The commentary pointed out that the US policy in Asia seems to increasingly mean the union of white imperialist countries against Asian countries. The participation of the notorious Taiwan regime, Syngman Rhee, the Thai government, and the Indochina puppet government in the "Pacific Pact" cannot conceal the significance of the action that US newspapers and Dulles himself have all admitted. One of its purposes is to ensure the occupation of Southeast Asia's natural resources for the benefit of "Western industrial civilization." Propaganda that attempts to portray those who have been beating coolies with sticks and are full of racial discrimination as saviors cannot deceive the people of Asia.

Indian "Telegraph" and "Commerce" Weekly
    The Indian public is very indignant at the US attempt to organize a new aggressive bloc in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. The "Telegraph" of Kampur wrote that it is difficult to foresee what is different between this new organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the "European Defense Group". Now is the time for the Indian government to protest and mobilize Southeast Asian public opinion to oppose this attempt.
    "Commerce" Weekly believes that the steps taken by Western countries to put together a military alliance similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Southeast Asia are aimed at achieving more sinister goals. The "Lokvani" in Jaipur emphasized that the American war hysteria poses the most serious threat to international peace and causes great anxiety to Asian countries.
    Indian newspapers believe that the purpose of the recent US military measures is to undermine the Geneva Conference.

Indonesian "Merdeka" and "Masyarakat"
    Indonesian public opinion does not agree with the US proposal to put together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. The influential "Merdeka" quoted an authoritative observer in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, on the 20th as saying that Indonesia does not want to participate in this alliance that is used by one group against another. The observer emphasized that Indonesia will do its best to promote the easing of the situation in order to achieve world peace and provide Indonesia with broad opportunities for construction.
    "Masyarakat" said in an editorial on the 20th: "It is impossible for Indonesia to join a plan aimed at encircling communism, because Indonesia pursues an independent policy." The newspaper added, "Participating in this plan means that Indonesia abandons its independent policy."

"Ceylon Times" and "Ceylon Observer"
    Ceylon newspapers condemned the US attempt to establish a military alliance in Southeast Asia.
    The "Ceylon Times" said in an editorial on the 16th: Western political strategy, that is, the strategy of the US State Department, has proven to be a failure in whatever region it has been implemented in the East in the past 20 years.
    The editorial condemned the war threats issued by the United States and said: "We Southeast Asians do not believe that a hot war is inevitable, nor do we believe that the countries in this region must form alliances on either side of the Cold War." The editorial said that Asia must save itself from the nets of Western destructive forces.
    The "Ceylon Observer" said that the United States' advocacy of the establishment of a military alliance in Southeast Asia is "another example of the overbearing diplomacy of the US State Department, which, due to its traditional clumsiness, increases international suspicion of US territorial ambitions."
    The newspaper advocated the formation of a group of Asian countries to protest this "imperialist threat" and said that Asian prime ministers must once again demand an immediate ceasefire in Indochina in order to immediately ease the tension in Asia. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 各国舆论反对美国在东南亚拼凑侵略集团  揭穿美国政策的殖民主义本质

    各国舆论反对美国在东南亚拼凑侵略集团
    揭穿美国政策的殖民主义本质
    苏联“消息报”
    “消息报”二十日登载弗·库德里雅夫采夫的一篇文章，评论美国建立亚洲军事集团计划的背后阴谋。他指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯在日内瓦会议前夕，建议在东南亚和西太平洋建立与北大西洋集团类似的军事联盟，这个事实本身再次证明，美国某些人士不但不致力于为亚洲问题的和平解决创造条件，反而狂热地采取措施，以扩大印度支那战争，使亚洲和世界局势紧张起来。文章说：美国拼凑太平洋军事集团的目的是要镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动，保持帝国主义国家在亚洲国家的殖民统治，并加紧排挤它的竞争者。
    文章接着写道：可是，美国侵略集团的如意打算没有估计到亚洲真正的主人——亚洲各国人民的意志。印度“国民先驱报”指出，美国“硬要干涉他人的事情”。该报并写道，东南亚各国人民应该自行决定：他们究竟是需要像中国人民所享有的那种自由，还是需要现在在印度支那、马来亚和怯尼亚所存在的那种“自由”。锡兰科伦坡的“火车报”指出，亚洲各国人民“已经深信，美国不断地在推行侵略政策”。
    库德里雅夫采夫最后写道：许多这样的说法证明，美国统治集团在策划建立东南亚军事集团的计划时，忘记了他们对待的已不是一个旧的落后的亚洲，而是一个新的正在站立起来为民族解放而斗争的亚洲。对杜勒斯关于建立东南亚以及西太平洋军事集团的建议的初步反应已经说明，这一建议不可能指望得到亚洲各国人民的任何支持。
    法国“人道报”
    皮埃尔·古达德十六日在巴黎“人道报”上发表评论，揭穿杜勒斯所要拼凑的“太平洋公约”的殖民主义本质。
    评论说：杜勒斯离开巴黎以后，以拟订西方国家在日内瓦会议上的策略为目的的法、英、美三国会谈，在巴黎开始了。一小撮负责实施杜勒斯制订的破坏策略的法国外交部官员们，代表着法国参加这个会谈。实际上这就是要把日内瓦会议引入僵局，以便最后证明缔结“太平洋公约”是合理的，而这个公约就可以使印度支那战争的“国际化”成为“合法”的了。
    评论说：然而，一切的阴谋都阻挡不了在日内瓦会议上提出真正的问题来。西方国家如果逃避这些问题，它们便将受到各国人民，特别是亚洲人民的谴责。评论指出，美国在亚洲地区的政策看来日益意味着白种人帝国主义国家反对各亚洲国家的联合。声名狼藉的台湾政权、李承晚、泰国政府和印度支那傀儡政府的参加“太平洋公约”，并不能掩饰美国报纸和杜勒斯本人全都承认的那种行动的意义，它的目的之一，就是要保证占有东南亚的天然资源，以利于“西方的工业文明”。企图把一直用棍棒殴打苦力和满口种族歧视的人说成是救世主的那种宣传，是欺骗不了亚洲人民的。
    印度“电讯报”和“商业”周刊
    印度公众对美国企图在太平洋和东南亚地区组织一个新的侵略集团表示非常愤慨。康波尔的“电讯报”写道，很难预料这个新的组织与北大西洋公约组织和“欧洲防务集团”有什么不同。现在是印度政府表示抗议并动员东南亚舆论来反对这种企图的时候了。
      “商业”周刊认为，西方国家为了在东南亚拼凑一个类似北大西洋公约组织的军事同盟而采取的步骤，是想要达到更罪恶的目的。斋浦尔“洛克瓦尼报”强调说：美国的战争歇斯底里给国际和平造成了最严重的威胁并引起了亚洲国家的极大不安。
    印度的报纸都认为，美国最近的军事措施的目的在于破坏日内瓦会议。
    印尼“独立报”和“社会使者报”
    印尼舆论不同意美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团的建议。有势力的“独立报”二十日援引印尼首都雅加达一个权威观察家的话说，印尼不想参加这种被一个集团用来反对另一个集团的联盟。这个观察家着重指出，印尼将尽力促进形势的缓和，以便实现世界和平并为印尼提供进行建设的广泛机会。
    “社会使者报”二十日的社论说：“要印度尼西亚加入目的在包围共产主义的计划是不可能的，因为印度尼西亚奉行着独立的政策。”该报又说，“参加这种计划就是意味着印度尼西亚放弃独立政策”。
    “锡兰时报”和“锡兰观察家报”
    锡兰报纸谴责美国企图在东南亚建立军事同盟的计划。
    “锡兰时报”十六日社论说：西方的政治战略，也就是美国国务院的战略，在过去二十年中已经证明不论在东方那个地区实施总是失败的。
    社论斥责美国发出的战争威胁，并且说：“我们东南亚人不相信热战是不可避免的，甚至也不相信这个地区的国家必须在冷战的任何一边结成联盟。”社论说，亚洲必须把自己从西方破坏势力的罗网中自救出来。
    “锡兰观察家报”说：美国主张在东南亚建立军事同盟，是“美国国务院的蛮横外交的另一例子，这种政策由于它传统的笨拙，增加了国际对美国领土野心的怀疑”。
    该报主张组成亚洲国家集团抗议这种“帝国主义的威胁”，并说，亚洲的总理们必须再次要求立即在印度支那停火，这样才能立即缓和亚洲的紧张局势。　（据新华社讯）
