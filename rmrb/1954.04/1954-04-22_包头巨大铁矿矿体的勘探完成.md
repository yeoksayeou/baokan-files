    Exploration of Huge Iron Ore Deposit in Baotou Completed

    The geological exploration team directly under the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, which was exploring the iron ore area near Baotou, has completed the comprehensive exploration of a huge ore body. Now they have compiled the exploration results into detailed reports and maps, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government. All staff members also held a grand celebration meeting, expressing their determination to continue to strive to overfulfill the tasks assigned by the state in 1954.

    Over the past three years, this geological exploration team has overcome various difficulties on the sparsely populated grasslands of Inner Mongolia, extracted nearly 10,000 meters of core, and completed thousands of cubic meters of trench exploration and shallow well exploration. In 1953, geological exploration work in the mining area added important projects such as physical prospecting, laboratory analysis, sampling, ore crushing, and thin section preparation. These work projects have all overfulfilled or nearly completed the original plan. Tasks not included in the original plan, such as elevation measurement, hydrogeology, and route surveying, were also completed on time through the hard work of the geological personnel.

    包头巨大铁矿矿体的勘探完成
    勘探包头附近铁矿区的中央人民政府地质部直属地质勘探队，已完成了一个巨大矿体的全面勘探工作。现在他们已经把勘探成果编写成详细的报告和图件等，呈送给中央人民政府地质部。全体职工并举行了隆重的庆祝大会，表示一定要在一九五四年内继续为超额完成国家所交给的任务而奋斗。
    这个地质勘探队三年多来在人迹罕到的内蒙古草原上，克服种种困难，共提取了近万公尺的岩芯，完成了槽探和浅井探达数千立方公尺。一九五三年中，矿区地质勘探工作又增加了物理探矿、化验、采样、碎矿、磨片等重要项目，这些工作项目都超额完成或接近完成了原订计划。原未列入计划的拔海高度、水文地质、线路测量等，经过地质人员们辛勤的努力，也按时完成了任务。
