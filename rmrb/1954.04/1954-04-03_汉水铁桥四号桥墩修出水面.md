    Han River Railway Bridge Pier No. 4 Emerges Above Water

    The Han River Railway Bridge Pier No. 4 project emerged above the water surface on March 26th.

    Pier No. 4 is one of the key projects of the Han River Railway Bridge. Its completion before the flood season is of great significance to the overall construction of the Han River Railway Bridge. After completing the steel sheet pile cofferdam on February 17th, the workers overcame many complex technical difficulties in a series of construction processes over the past month, including mud suction, joining wooden cofferdams, underwater concrete sealing, dewatering, pouring foundations, and the first and second sections of the pier.

    On March 3rd, the day the sealing began, leading comrades from the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau went to the site to direct the work, and Soviet expert Oniskov also came to observe the pouring situation. That day happened to be a cold wave, with strong winds and heavy rain, and everyone was soaked. In addition, the vast majority of workers had never done underwater concrete pouring work, so the work was very unsuccessful in the first half of the night. Because the leadership insisted on directing, using successful experience, solving problems in a timely manner, and carrying out mobilization at the right time, the situation changed in the second half of the night, and everyone had initially mastered the technology and characteristics of underwater pouring. Workers, engineering technicians, and other working comrades persisted tensely in the cold wind and rain. Crane operator Sun Baocai had done underwater concrete pouring work and was more skilled in operation. After completing his task at 11 o'clock that night, he immediately volunteered to help other groups and persisted until 10 o'clock the next morning. Thanks to the calm and persistent struggle against all difficulties by the Engineering Bureau and the site leading comrades, coupled with the selfless work of workers and engineering technicians, the sealing work was finally completed victoriously at 3 pm on the 4th. After dewatering, the quality of the sealing was very good and fully met the standards.

    Pier No. 4 is located in the heart of the Han River, with deep water and fast currents, making the project very difficult. The emergence of Pier No. 4 above the water has not only greatly improved the leadership comrades, technicians, and workers in this test, thereby strengthening their confidence in future work, but also initially explored some experience in technology, construction organization, and project leadership, laying the foundation for future work.

### 汉水铁桥四号桥墩修出水面

    汉水铁桥四号桥墩修出水面
    汉水铁桥四号桥墩工程，已在三月二十六日修出水面。
    四号桥墩是汉水铁桥的关键工程之一，在洪水期前修出水面，对整个汉水铁桥的建设有很大意义。这个桥墩在二月十七日完成钢板桩围堰以后，一个多月来，职工们在吸泥、接木围堰、水下混凝土封底、抽水、浇灌基础和桥墩的第一、二节等一系列的施工过程中，曾克服了许多复杂的技术上的困难。
    三月三日封底开始的那天，武汉大桥工程局的领导同志，都深入现场指挥工作，苏联专家奥尼斯柯夫也赶来观察浇灌情况。当天正遇寒潮，狂风急雨，人人都浑身湿透。加以绝大多数工人都未做过水下灌注混凝土的工作，因此上半夜工作很不顺利。由于领导上坚持指挥，运用成功经验，及时解决问题，适时进行鼓动，因而下半夜的情况就转变了，大家已初步掌握了水下浇灌的技术及特点。工人、工程技术人员和其他工作同志，在寒风冷雨中一直紧张地坚持工作。装吊工孙宝才曾做过水下灌注混凝土的工作，操作比较熟练，在当晚十一点钟完成自己的任务后，又马上主动去帮助别的小组，一直坚持到第二天早上十点钟。由于工程局及工地领导同志镇静坚持地与一切困难作斗争，加上工人和工程技术人员忘我的工作，封底工作终于在四日下午三时全部胜利完成。抽水以后，封底质量非常好，完全合乎标准。
    四号桥墩位置在汉水河心，水深、流速大，工程十分艰巨。四号桥墩修出水面，不仅领导同志、技术人员和工人都在这一次考验中有了很大的提高，从而加强了今后工作的信心；同时在技术上、施工组织上、工程领导上也都初步摸索出一些经验，为今后工作奠定了基础。　（辛　仪）
