    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's No. 1 Blast Furnace Completes First Half-Month Plan
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's No. 1 Blast Furnace Responds to "May Day" Labor Competition
    [Our Newspaper] Since the initiation of the labor competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day by all the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, they have victoriously completed the production plan for the first half of the month ten hours ahead of schedule on the 15th. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has reached 0.773, the coke ratio has been reduced to 0.874, the products fully meet the quality requirements, and personal and equipment accidents have been eliminated.
    In the competition, the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace actively implemented the advanced Soviet experience of "grading ore into the furnace," which increased iron production by 1.3 percent. Now, the workers are actively promoting the spirit of technological innovation, striving to over fulfill the entire month's plan, and offering a gift to "May Day."
    [Our Newspaper] All the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Iron Smelting Department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant enthusiastically responded to the labor competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day initiated by the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Based on their production situation, all workers put forward competition indicators and guarantee conditions. The competition indicators are: to complete the April production plan seventeen hours ahead of schedule, and to bring the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace to 0.8; to ensure product quality and eliminate pig iron rejects; to reduce the coke ratio from 0.927 to 0.91 (reducing coke consumption by 17 kilograms per ton of pig iron) to ensure cost reduction; and to ensure the elimination of personal and equipment accidents and achieve safe production.
    In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, all workers proposed: to conscientiously implement the shift handover system; to conscientiously implement the one-chief system in the production area; to strictly implement operating procedures; to ensure an attendance rate of 97 percent; to ensure the implementation of Soviet expert advice; to launch a technological innovation movement; to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair; and to improve the qualified rate of tapping hole depth and use seven-pound wind to plug the tapping hole to ensure output and prevent accidents. After the competition conditions were set, all workers further formulated guarantee plans for groups and individuals. Now, the workers are working hard to over fulfill the April production task and welcome "May Day."
