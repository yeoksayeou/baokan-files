Editor's Note: After the publication of reader's letter "Suggestions on Developing Fish Farming in Areas Under the Jurisdiction of Beijing" and the "Investigation of Fish Farming in Lakes and Ponds in Beijing" by the Aquatic Products Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and the reader's letter group of this newspaper on February 6, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Agriculture and Forestry Bureau has drafted a fish farming plan and is preparing to establish a "Beijing Suburban Fish Farming Demonstration Farm" in Dapaizi, a water area of about 500 mu in the southern suburbs. The Beijing Municipal Parks Administration is also actively preparing for fish farming in the 5,000 mu of water area under its jurisdiction. In addition, many readers from Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Guangxi, Suiyuan, Hebei and other places have written to support this proposal, and hope that cities with conditions to develop fish farming can attach importance to this work. Many readers have also enthusiastically introduced their experiences in freshwater fish farming in their letters. We have selected some of them for publication here.

Developing Fish Farming in Urban Areas

Good Experiences in Fish Farming at Dongjia Lake, Xishui County

Letter from the Aquatic Products Section of the People's Government of Xishui County, Hubei: Our county achieved high yields in fish farming in Dongjia Lake in 1953. We are now providing our fish farming situation and experience for the reference of comrades engaged in fish farming.

Dongjia Lake has a water area of ​​30.5 mu and a water depth of only 2 to 4 feet, with a small water storage capacity, but there are many plankton in the water. We started stocking on January 10, 1953, and put in 15,013 fish of five species: black carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and carp. We began harvesting on November 10 of the same year. The largest bighead carp weighed 8 jin each, and the average was more than 2 jin; the largest silver carp weighed 3 jin 10 liang, and the average was 2 jin 4 liang; the largest carp weighed 6 jin 12 liang, and the average was 1 jin 12 liang. A total of 26,884 jin of fish were caught in the whole lake, and it is estimated that there are still 500 jin of fish in the lake; after deducting the fish fry released, the average yield per mu reached 758 jin. Although the price of fish is cheaper in our area, the fish caught sold for more than 49 million yuan; but after deducting all the investment, the net income still reached 33 million yuan.

The key to our success is the meticulous artificial feeding. First, feeding is timed, which can cultivate the feeding habits of fish and help them grow healthily. Generally, we feed at 7 am and 3 pm; if the weather is hot and the water temperature reaches 37 degrees Celsius, we feed at 6 am and 5 pm. Second, feed is given according to the size and needs of the fish. At the beginning, because the fish are small, more bean dregs are fed; after a month, cattle dung and duckweed are added; when the small fish grow to more than half a jin, barnyard grass and artemisia are added; finally, distiller's grains and snail meat are added. Third, different spreading methods are adopted for various feeds. For example, bean dregs can float on the water surface for 3 or 4 minutes, so they can be loaded onto a boat and sprinkled evenly over the lake with a ladle. Artemisia, duckweed, barnyard grass, etc. are only eaten by grass carp, so choose a sheltered lake to sprinkle them. Distiller's grains sink as soon as they enter the water, so build several feeding platforms with bamboo strips 2 feet below the water surface and pour the distiller's grains on the platform. Fourth, in order to make full use of the feed, we use seine nets to catch fish every 26 days or a month to allow the lake water to convect up and down, and the nutrient-containing substances at the bottom of the lake rise to provide food for the fish; it can also promote the movement of fish and facilitate growth; at the same time, it also catches a small number of fish to check its growth and whether there are any diseases, so as to study and improve the feed supply.

When raising fish, you must also pay attention to the following: It is not advisable to release fish fry too late, otherwise the temperature will gradually increase, and the fish fry will easily die during transportation. The fish fry released should be larger and neater, preferably about six inches; too small ones are easily harmed and grow slowly. The number of fish stocked should be determined according to the conditions of the lake and the type of fish. Dongjia Lake has no aquatic plants, and the grass carp we released grew very slowly; if we change to other types of fish, it will increase the yield per unit area of water. In addition, in order to grasp the amount and type of feed according to the season, we must do research work, record the changes in weather, the rise and fall of water temperature, and the impact of changes in water color on fish at any time, check the growth and feeding of fish every half a month, and prevent fish diseases in time. Always pay attention to the gate to prevent fish from escaping and harmful fish from entering.

Using Wild Grass to Raise Fish Fry

Can Save Manpower and Material Resources

Readers Yang Fengjie and Zhang Mengda wrote: Wangtian Lake Aquaculture Farm in Xishui County, Hubei Province, conducted an experiment on using wild grass to feed fish fry. They put 248 jin of artemisia and wild grass into a fish pond with an area of ​​1.8 li, soaked them for two days, and produced a large number of planktonic insects, and then put 100,000 fish flowers into the pond for feeding. Because there are small insects in the water, they only feed half a jin of soybean milk every day, which reduces the feed by two-thirds compared with the past. After nine days from the time of putting the grass, more than 38,000 fish fry with a body length of seven minutes were raised, which shortened the feeding time by one-third compared with the past. This experiment proves that using wild grass to feed fish fry can save manpower and material resources, and is worth promoting.

### 利用城市所辖水面发展养鱼业

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：二月六日本报刊载了读者“建议  利用北京市所辖水面发展养鱼事业”的来信及  中央农业部水产管理总局和本报读者来信组对“北京市湖塘养鱼情况的调查”后，北京市人  民政府农林局已拟定了养鱼计划，准备在南郊约有五百亩水面的大泡子建立“京郊养鱼示范场”；北京市园林管理处也正对该处所辖五千亩水面的养鱼工作积极进行准备。此外，湖北、浙江、福建、安徽、广西、绥远、河北等地不少读者也来信拥护这个建议，并希望各地有条件发展养鱼事业的城市都能重视这个工作。不少读者在来信中还热情地介绍了他们从事淡水养鱼工作的经验，现在选择一部分在这里发表。    
    利用城市所辖水面发展养鱼业
    浠水县董家湖养鱼的好经验
    湖北浠水县人民政府水产科来信：我县一九五三年在董家湖养鱼，获得了丰产。现在我们把养鱼情况及经验提供从事养鱼工作的同志们参考。
    董家湖水面三十亩五分，水深仅二尺到四尺，容水量不大，但水中浮游生物很多。一九五三年一月十日开始放养，我们放入青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳙鱼、鲤鱼五种鱼一万五千零一十三尾。当年十一月十日开始捕捞。鳙鱼最大的每尾已长到八斤，一般的也有二斤多；鲢鱼最大的有三斤十两，一般的有二斤四两；鲤鱼最大的有六斤十二两，一般的也有
  一斤十二两。全湖共捕获鱼二万六千八百八十四斤，估计湖内还有鱼五百斤；除去所放鱼种，平均每亩产量达七百五十八斤。虽然我处鱼价较便宜，所打出的鱼共卖了四千九百多万元；但除去全部投资后，纯收益仍达三千三百万元。
    我们获得丰收的关键，是由于细致地进行了人工投饵工作。第一、投饵有定时，这样可以养成鱼类的食饵习惯，有助鱼类健康地生长。一般我们是在上午七时和下午三时投饵；若天气炎热，水温到摄氏三十七度时，就在早上六时和下午五时投食。第二、按照鱼的大小和需要投给饵料。开始因鱼类较小，多喂豆渣；一个月以后加喂牛粪和浮萍；待小鱼长到半斤以上，加喂稗子草及蒿草；最后又加喂酒糟和螺丝肉。第三、对各种饵料采用不同的撒布方法。如豆渣能在水面浮三、四分钟，可以用船装到湖中，用瓢向全湖均匀撒布。蒿草、浮萍、稗子草等只有草鱼要吃，就选择一个可避风的湖汊撒布。酒糟入水即下沉，所以用竹箔在水面下二尺的地方搭几座食饵台，把酒糟倒在台上。第四、为了充分利用食料，我们每隔二十六天或一个月用漩网捞捕一次，使湖水上下对流，湖底含有养份的物质上升，供给鱼类食用；又可以促使鱼类游动，易于成长；同时还捞捕少数鱼类，检查它的成长情况、有无病害，以便研究改进供应饵料工作。
    养鱼时，还必须注意以下一些事：投放鱼种不宜过迟，否则气温渐增，鱼种在搬运时易遭死亡。投放的鱼种要大些，整齐些的，最好在六寸左右；过小的易遭害，且成长较慢。要根据湖泊的条件配合鱼的种类，决定放养数目。董家湖没有水草，我们投放的草鱼成长就很慢；如果改放其它鱼类，就会提高单位水面的产量。另外，为了按季节掌握投饵的分量和种类，必须做好研究工作，随时记载天气的变化、水温的升降、水色的变化对鱼类的影响，每半月检查一次鱼的成长及食饵情况，及时防止鱼类的病害。经常注意闸口，防止鱼类逃窜和害鱼侵入等。
    利用野草养鱼苗
    可以节省人力物力
    读者杨峰杰、张猛达来信：湖北省浠水县望天湖养殖场进行了利用野草饲养鱼苗的试验。他们在
  一个一分八厘面积的鱼池里放下了二百四十八斤艾蒿与野草，沤了两天，生出了大量的浮游细虫，然后把十万尾鱼花放入池里饲养。因为水里有细虫，所以每天只喂半斤黄豆的豆浆，比过去减少饵料三分之二。从下草时起经过九天，就养出了身长七分的鱼苗三万八千多条，比过去饲养的时间缩短了三分之一。这次试验证明，利用野草饲养鱼苗可以节省人力物力，值得推广。
