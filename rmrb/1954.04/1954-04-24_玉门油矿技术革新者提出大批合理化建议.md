Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 23rd: Many technical innovators at the Yumen Oil Mine have put forward more than 3,300 rationalization proposals that have been adopted in the past year or so, creating a value of 5 billion yuan for the country. These suggestions have played a significant role in exceeding the oil mine's production plan last year and reducing production costs. To commend these technical innovators, the Yumen Oil Mine recently issued bonuses of over 210 million yuan.

    Inspired by the enthusiasm for building the motherland's oil base, the employees of Yumen Oil Mine have put forward many rationalization proposals in the past year or so. According to statistics from the oil mine's trade union, an average of one suggestion was put forward for every two people, with the most prolific individual submitting six or seven. Wang Lin, the leader of the riveters group in the machinery factory, improved the method of making oil float baffles for oil and gas separators, increasing efficiency by six times. Previously, making them by hand, he could produce a maximum of 200 pieces per day; now, using a tool fixture, he can make more than 1,400 pieces per day. This has reduced the installation time of the oil and gas separators at the oil selection station by half. Zuo Xinglin, a young lathe operator in the machinery factory, recently improved the electric lathe, making it capable of both forward and reverse rotation. Previously, threading a type of screw required manual cranking, but now it can be done automatically. This improvement has increased production efficiency by more than four times. Zhou Zhihua, a foreman at the oil production plant, with the assistance of technician Wang Chuanxin, changed the wax removal packing gland to a double layer, preventing oil spraying and gas leakage during oil well wax removal, saving more than 200,000 liters of crude oil per year. The combination of technical personnel and workers at the oil mine has also resulted in many valuable rationalization proposals. He Zhenpeng, deputy engineer of the oil refinery, has proposed six important technical improvements, such as working with the employees of the distillation workshop to install a flash distillation tower at the secondary tower, preventing oil surging and eliminating the production of substandard lubricating oil, saving more than 250 million yuan per year. Thanks to the innovative spirit of the technical personnel, 48 technical cadres were selected as labor models at the mining bureau level in 1953.

    Each factory and team at the Yumen Oil Mine has a dedicated Rationalization Proposal Working Committee. Whenever production plans are discussed, employees are organized to put forward rationalization proposals around one or two key issues. The technical offices of each factory and team have also established a system for timely review of employees' rationalization proposals, and those that pass the review are generally incorporated into the technical organization measures plan for implementation.

    玉门油矿技术革新者提出大批合理化建议
    【新华社西安二十三日电】玉门油矿的许多技术革新者一年多来共提出了三千三百多件已被采纳的合理化建议，为国家创造的价值有五十亿元。这些建议对于超额完成去年油矿的生产计划和降低生产成本起了很大作用。玉门油矿为了表扬这些技术革新者，最近特发出二亿一千多万元的奖金予以奖励。
    玉门油矿职工这一年多来为建设祖国石油基地的热情所鼓舞，提出了许多合理化建议。据油矿工会统计，平均每两人就提出一件建议，最多的一人提出六、七件。机械厂铆工组长王琳改进做油气分离器油漂篦子的方法后，效率提高了六倍。以前用手工做，每天最多做二百片；现在用工具胎做，每天可做一千四百多片。这样就使选油站上油气分离器的安装时间缩短了一半。机械厂青年车工左杏林最近改进了电动车床，使它既能正转，也能反转，过去车的一种螺丝要用手摇，现在能自动地车了。这一改进使生产效率提高了四倍多。采油厂工长周志华，在技师王传信的帮助下，把清蜡盘根盒改为双层，防止了油井清蜡时发生喷油和漏气现象，一年可节约原油二十多万公升。油矿的技术人员和工人相结合，也提出很多有价值的合理化建议。炼油厂副工程师何振鹏曾提出的重要技术改进就有六件，如他和蒸馏车间职工研究，在二级塔处加装一座闪蒸塔，防止了冲油现象，使机油不再出次品，一年可节约二亿五千多万元。由于技术人员的革新精神，一九五三年有四十八个技术干部被评选为矿务局级的劳动模范。
    玉门油矿各厂、队都专门设有合理化建议工作委员会，每逢讨论生产计划时，就有组织的发动职工围绕一两个关键问题提出合理化建议。各厂、队技术室并制订有及时审查职工合理化建议的制度，审查合格的一般都编入技术组织措施计划内来实行。上海各界人民积极筹备庆祝“五一”劳动节
    【本报上海二十三日电】上海市人民庆祝“五一”劳动节筹委会成立。上海市劳动人民正在热烈准备迎接自己的节日。中共上海市委员会、上海总工会、中国人民解放军驻上海部队、各民主党派上海市地方组织和上海市各人民团体的代表，在四月二十日上午集会，商讨有关纪念今年“五一”国际劳动节的筹备事宜。
    会议在讨论中指出：纪念今年“五一”国际劳动节，应结合上海总工会及五金、纺织、轻工业三个产业工会在“五一”节前后召开的代表大会以及全市性的一九五三年工业劳动模范、先进工作者代表大会和工业生产展览会等活动，在工人群众中继续深入贯彻国家过渡时期总任务的宣传教育，提高工人阶级的社会主义觉悟，号召工人群众努力学习苏联先进经验，发扬技术革新精神，进一步深入开展经常性的劳动竞赛，争取以全面完成和超额完成生产任务的实际行动来迎接这个伟大的节日。会议决定在今年五月一日举行盛大的游行示威。为了做好今年“五一”国际劳动节纪念活动的准备工作，会议决定成立上海市人民庆祝一九五四年“五一”国际劳动节筹备委员会。
