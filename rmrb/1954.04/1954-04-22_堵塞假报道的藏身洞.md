    Plugging the Hideouts of False Reports
    On February 22nd, the *New Hunan Daily* published a news item in a prominent position on page two: "Zhou Guangyi, militia captain of Yongxing Township, Xinning, gloriously sacrificed himself while bravely rescuing a forest fire," and published a short commentary, "Comrade Zhou Guangyi, who gave his life to fight the fire, will live forever." After the news and commentary were published, they attracted great attention from the relevant leading organs and the broad masses in Hunan Province. The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau specially sent people to Yongxing Township, Xinning County, to offer condolences. Many readers wrote to the newspaper, expressing their intention to learn from Zhou Guangyi's spirit of cherishing the property of the country and the people.
    However, according to the Xinning County Party Committee Office of the Chinese Communist Party, this news was fabricated from beginning to end. After investigation and understanding by the editorial department of the *New Hunan Daily*, it was confirmed that it was a completely fabricated false report. At the same time, the publication of this false report by the newspaper had created an extremely bad influence among the local masses.
    The author of this false report was Xia Xianchun, a student at Wugang Normal School. Xia Xianchun did not pay attention to learning at school and his life was quite undisciplined. For the personal purpose of defrauding manuscript fees and showing off, he consistently fabricated false reports and sent them to the *New Hunan Daily*, *China Youth Daily*, *Shanghai Wenhui Daily*, *Hunan Youth Daily*, and *Zijiang Farmers' Daily*, among other newspapers. Although he had been exposed by his classmates, the school and the Youth League branch (Xia was a member of the Youth League) did not seriously criticize and educate him on his bad style, so that he could understand the principle that news must be completely true. As a result, Xia Xianchun repeatedly made the mistake of writing false reports. Although most of the false reports he wrote were not adopted by various newspapers, a small part of them found a hiding place in some newspapers due to the carelessness of the editors. The false report about Zhou Guangyi's sacrifice in fighting the fire published by the *New Hunan Daily* this time is one such example.
    The fact that a fabricated news item such as Zhou Guangyi's sacrifice in fighting the fire could still appear after the struggle against bureaucracy and false reports shows that some authors have a bad reporting style. On the other hand, it also reflects that the editorial department's opposition to false reports is not thorough enough. As the *New Hunan Daily* pointed out in its editorial on April 3rd regarding this matter, the fundamental principle of the Party's and the people's newspapers that news must be completely true has not received enough attention and been universally observed in the editorial department of the newspaper. Therefore, when dealing with relatively important manuscripts such as Zhou Guangyi's sacrifice in fighting the fire, the relevant editorial staff did not conduct even the most basic investigation, but "hastily published it simply because the original manuscript was touching in its narration." The editorial department of the *New Hunan Daily* is conducting an in-depth review around this false report incident, which is absolutely necessary. Only by seriously learning from the lessons of false reports can the editorial department effectively improve its work. One of the lessons that should be learned from the false report incident of Zhou Guangyi's sacrifice in fighting the fire is that the editorial department must establish a strict investigation system. Before publishing manuscripts, it must identify the truth of the facts and the identity of the author, so as to effectively plug all the hideouts of false reports.

### 堵塞假报道的藏身洞

    堵塞假报道的藏身洞
    二月二十二日，新湖南报以二版显著地位发表了“新宁永兴乡民兵队长周光宜奋不顾身抢救山林火灾光荣牺牲”的消息，并发表了“舍身救火的周光宜同志永垂不朽”的短评。消息和短评发表后，引起了湖南省有关领导机关和广大群众的重视。湖南省林业局特地派人到新宁县永兴乡吊唁。不少读者写信给报社，表示要学习周光宜爱护国家和人民财产的精神。
    但是，据中共新宁县委会办公室揭发，这条消息原来是从头到尾凭空捏造的。后经新湖南报编辑部调查了解的结果，证实它完全是一篇无中生有的假报道，同时报纸发表这篇假报道已在当地群众中造成了极其恶劣的影响。
    这篇假报道的作者是武冈师范学校的学生夏贤春。夏贤春在校中不重视学习，生活相当散漫，为了骗取稿费、出风头的个人目的，一贯编造假报道，投寄给新湖南报和中国青年报、上海文汇报、湖南青年报、资江农民报等报。虽曾被同学揭发过，但校方和青年团支部（夏系青年团员）并没有认真对他的恶劣作风进行批评教育，使他认识新闻必须完全真实的道理。这样，夏贤春便一再重复写假报道的错误。他所写的假报道虽然大都未被各报采用，但也有一小部分因报纸编辑粗枝大叶而在某些报纸上找到了藏身之所。新湖南报这次发表的周光宜救火牺牲的假报道，就是其中的一个例子。
    像周光宜救火牺牲这样虚构的新闻稿件，在反对官僚主义、反对假报道的斗争以后仍然能够出现，固然说明了某些作者报道作风的恶劣，但另一面也反映了编辑部反对假报道还不彻底。正如新湖南报在四月三日就这事发表的社论中所指出的，新闻必须完全真实，这一党的、人民的报纸的根本原则，在该报编辑部中还没有受到足够重视和被普遍遵守，因而有关编辑人员在处理类似周光宜救火牺牲这样比较重要的稿件时，竟不经起码的调查，就“只从文字上看到原稿叙述感人，便仓卒刊了出来”。新湖南报编辑部正在围绕这次的假报道事件进行深入的检查，这是十分必要的。编辑部只有认真接受假报道的教训，才能切实改进自己的工作。从周光宜救火牺牲的假报道事件所应该吸取的教训之一，就是编辑部必须建立严格的调查制度，在发表稿件之前，必须辨明事实的真相和作者的身份，这样才能有效地堵塞住一切假报道的藏身洞。
