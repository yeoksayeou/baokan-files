Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 17th: According to TASS Moscow, the troupe of the French national theatre—the French Comedy Theatre—is currently on a tour of the Soviet Union. From the 7th to the 15th, they performed more than ten times in Moscow. The repertoire included Molière's comedies "The Bourgeois Gentleman" and "Tartuffe," Corneille's "Le Cid," and Jules Renard's one-act comedy "Carrot Top."

During the performances, the troupe was warmly welcomed by the Moscow audience. The actors' brilliant performances, as well as the noble taste and extraordinary style of the scenery and costumes, left a deep impression on the audience. The plays they performed vividly demonstrated the spirit and style of the theatre, which for nearly three centuries has represented the progressive social thought of France, maintaining an organic connection with outstanding literature and progressive materialist philosophy.

After the performances in Moscow, the troupe will travel to Leningrad to perform.

Also, the famous dancers of the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre in Leningrad are preparing to visit France in May for performances.
