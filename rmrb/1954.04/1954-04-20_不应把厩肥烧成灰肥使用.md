Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Manure Should Not Be Burned into Ash for Fertilizer
    Ye Churu, Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Wenzhou Special District, Zhejiang Province, writes: Manure contains three elements: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, and is one of the best organic fertilizers. However, some farmers in some areas, because they do not understand the scientific principles, burn manure into ash before applying it to the fields. As a result, the nitrogen fertilizer in the manure dissipates, and the organic matter that improves the soil is also lost, thus reducing the effectiveness of the manure.
    According to statistics from four villages in Shanli Township, Longquan County, more than 2,600 dan of manure were burned last year; and eight dan of manure are burned to produce only one dan of ash, which means a reduction of more than 2,300 dan. If calculated at ten dan of fertilizer per mu, the fertilizer lost would be enough for 230 mu of land. As for the actual effect of applying manure, it can be proven by the actual experience of Huang Zhangde, a farmer in the township. One year, Huang Zhangde applied 16 dan of manure to his 1.7 mu of land, and as a result, he harvested 190 jin more rice than with ash fertilizer. Therefore, I suggest that cadres and agricultural technicians in counties, districts, and townships should educate farmers to change the habit of burning manure into ash, and guide them to pile and rot the manure before applying it evenly to the fields, so as to maximize the effectiveness of the manure and benefit agricultural production.

### 不应把厩肥烧成灰肥使用

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不应把厩肥烧成灰肥使用
    浙江温州专署农林科叶楚儒来信：厩肥含有氮、钾、磷三种元素，是一种最好的有机质肥料。但是，有些地区的农民因为不懂得科学道理，将厩肥烧成灰后才施到田里去。这样做的结果，厩肥中的氮肥逸散了，有改良土壤作用的有机质也遭到损失，因而减低了厩肥的效力。
    据龙泉县山里乡四个村统计，去年烧了的厩肥就有二千六百多担；而八担厩肥才烧一担灰，这样就减少了二千三百多担。如以每亩地施十担肥计算，所损失的肥料，就足够二百三十亩田用。至于施用厩肥的实际效果，可以从该乡农民黄张德的实际经验来证明。有一年黄张德在他的一亩七分田内施用了十六担厩肥，结果比施灰肥多打了一百九十市斤稻子。为此，我建议各地的县、区、乡干部及农业技术干部，要教育农民改变那种将厩肥烧成灰的习惯，并指导他们将厩肥经过堆积、腐烂后，均匀地施到田里去，以发挥厩肥的效力，利于农业生产。
