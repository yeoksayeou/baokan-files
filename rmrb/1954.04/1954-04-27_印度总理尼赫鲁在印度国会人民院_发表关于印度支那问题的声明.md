    Indian Prime Minister Nehru's Statement to the Indian Parliament People's House Regarding the Indochina Issue

    [Xinhua News Agency] According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru made a statement on the Indochina issue in the People's House of the Indian Parliament on the 24th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    "As the People's House knows, in February, France, the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the United Kingdom agreed to convene a conference with themselves and the People's Republic of China participating. This conference will also invite other relevant countries to participate, to separately review the issues of Korea and Indochina. This conference will begin meeting next week in Geneva.

    "We are not participants in either this conference or the fierce war raging in Indochina. However, we are concerned about and deeply worried about Indochina, especially its recent developments. We are also concerned that the Geneva Conference should seek a negotiated solution to this problem and succeed, so that the shadow of war can be dispelled, a shadow that has long overshadowed areas near our country and threatens to expand and darken further.

    "To adopt an attitude that is the only one likely to prove constructive and fruitful, one must recognize the basic facts of the problem, the national and political sentiments involved, and the background and existing political and military situation there.

    "The Indochina conflict, in its origin and basic nature, is an anti-colonial resistance movement, and an attempt to deal with this resistance by means of traditional suppression and divide-and-rule tactics.

    "Foreign interference has complicated the issue, but it fundamentally remains anti-colonial and nationalistic in nature. Recognizing this and satisfying the national sentiment that demands freedom and independence, while protecting them from external pressure: only these can form the basis for a solution and peace.

    "Although heavy weapons are being used and large-scale battles are being fought, the conflict itself, even today, remains guerrilla warfare in nature, without fixed or stable front lines. The territory is divided by opposing forces, but there are no firm boundaries to demarcate their different regions. Large pockets or strips of land and population change hands daily or overnight. The war has its ups and downs, with local gains and losses, but the war continues year after year, growing more and more fierce. Millions of Indochinese combatants and other people, regardless of which side they belong to, are killed, injured, or suffer other hardships, and their land is reduced to desolation.

    "In Indochina, the challenge to imperialism, as a large-scale movement, began in 1940 against the Japanese occupation. During the war against Japan, the United States and Allied forces were assisted by the Viet Minh (founded in 1941) led by Ho Chi Minh and other nationalist or other groups. The Viet Minh's declaration at the time mentioned "the defense of democratic principles by the US, Soviet Union, UK, and China" and demanded that the major powers declare that after the overthrow of Japanese military power, the people of Indochina would be granted full autonomy.

    "After World War II, a provisional government was formed, with five communists among its fifteen members. This government was supported by moderate nationalists, Catholics, and others. Ho Chi Minh was elected chairman of the 'Democratic Republic of Vietnam,' which was proclaimed in September 1945 and recognized by the then Chinese government. On March 6, 1946, France, which had returned to Indochina after the war, signed an agreement with Ho Chi Minh, recognizing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "as a free state, with its government, parliament, army, and finances, and as a member of the Indochina Federation and the French Federation." However, this agreement did not last long.

    "The conflict between the Ho Chi Minh Republic and the French Empire began in 1947 and continues to this day. In June 1948, the French signed an agreement with former Annam Emperor Bao Dai, recognizing him as the head of Vietnam, a member state of the French Federation, as recognized by the French. The French also concluded similar agreements with the other two countries in Indochina—Laos and Cambodia.

    "At this stage, the Indochina conflict began to take on its current and extremely ominous aspect, reflecting the conflict between the two major camps. The material aid and equipment that the United States gave to France was used by the French to wage the Indochina War. On the other hand, although the Viet Minh still insisted that the war was a war against French colonialism, it was reported that the Viet Minh received supplies from the People's Republic of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China continued to grant the 'Democratic Republic of Vietnam' (Viet Minh) the recognition given by its predecessor government.

    "Interference followed interference, and the intensity of the war increased. Negotiations became increasingly difficult and fruitless. The developments in recent months have occurred against this backdrop.

    "The first of these developments was the decision by the four powers in Berlin to submit this issue to the Geneva Conference for consideration. We welcome this conference and express our hope that it will lead to peace in Indochina. We consider it a decision to seek a solution by following the path of consultation. At that time, I ventured to call for a ceasefire in Indochina in a statement made in this House, which was unanimously welcomed by this House.

    "Although the decision regarding the Geneva Conference was a welcome development, developments that aroused our concern and ominous premonitions soon followed. These included:

      1. Repeated references to immediate and large-scale retaliation, references to possible attacks on mainland China, and talk about expanding and intensifying the Indochina War;
      2. Invitations to Western countries, ANZUS treaty countries, and certain Asian countries to participate in joint and collective actions in Southeast Asia. Prior to this, several statements had been made that came close to undertaking the protection of Southeast Asian countries or unilaterally declaring a Monroe Doctrine over Southeast Asian countries.

    "Thus, there were already signs of direct intervention in Indochina, of the danger of the internationalization of the war and its expansion and intensification.

    "The convening of such an important conference clearly stemmed from the belief that negotiations were feasible and necessary, and before this conference, the appearance of statements that amounted to expressing a lack of sincerity towards this conference, statements announcing alternative actions that contained the meaning of threats of sanctions, the Indian government deeply regrets this situation and is very concerned. Negotiations have been hampered, they have started badly, and their progress will be tortuous—if there is any progress at all—in circumstances where intimidation, threats, contempt, and expressions of insincerity are made before negotiations begin.

    "Another factor that is inevitably making us even more uneasy is the acceleration of the pace of the war and the intensification of supplies in Indochina. For the Viet Minh, it is clear that there has been intensified supply support, which is said to have enabled the Viet Minh to launch a major offensive, intending to achieve a military victory in order to sway the upcoming conference in a direction favorable to them. For the French and Vietnamese sides, American aid has been intensified and guarantees of further aid have been offered.

    "For us in India, these developments are worthy of serious concern and contain tragic implications. They imply a danger to the independence newly won and cherished by Asian countries.

    "Maintaining the independence and sovereignty of Asian countries and ending colonial and foreign rule is essential for the prosperity of the peoples of Asia and for world peace.

    "We do not seek to play any special role in Asia, nor do we advocate any narrow and regional Asian regionalism. We only hope that we ourselves and other countries, especially our neighbors, become areas of peace, maintaining a policy of non-alignment or commitment in the world's tensions and wars. We believe that it is necessary to do so for our own sake, and that only in this way can we make our contribution to easing international tensions, promoting disarmament, and world peace.

    "However, current developments have cast a deep shadow over our hopes; they endanger our basic policies and seek to include us in an alliance.

    "For us, peace is not only a fervent hope; it is an urgent need.

    "Indochina is an Asian country and a region adjacent to (India). Although it has suffered great sacrifices, the current conflict has plunged it into a state of interference, endangering its prospects for freedom. Therefore, the crisis in Indochina deeply moves us and requires us to bring forth our best thinking and efforts to prevent this conflict from tending towards expansion and intensification and to promote its tendency to lead to a resolution.

    "The Indian government is deeply convinced that, despite the different views of the great politicians gathered in Geneva and their peoples, the deep-seated suspicions between them, and the conflicting rights they claim, they share the common goal of avoiding a tide of war. In its sincere desire to assist in resolving certain difficulties and deadlocks and promoting a peaceful settlement, the Indian government ventures to make the following recommendations:

      (1) An atmosphere of peace and consultation must be promoted, and the atmosphere of suspicion and the currently prevailing atmosphere of threat must be eliminated. To this end, the Indian government urges all parties concerned to cease making threats, and urges the belligerent parties not to intensify the pace of the war.

      (2) Ceasefire. To achieve this, the Indian government recommends: A. 'Ceasefire' should be given priority on the agenda of the Indochina conference. B. The ceasefire group should be composed of the actual belligerent parties, namely France and its three member states, and the Viet Minh.

      (3) Independence. The conference should decide and declare that a crucial point for resolving the conflict is the complete independence of Indochina, namely: the termination of French sovereignty, which should be determined by the French government undertaking an unambiguous obligation beyond doubt.

       (4) The conference should initiate direct negotiations between the parties directly concerned and primarily concerned. The conference should request the parties primarily concerned to enter into direct negotiations and, for this purpose, provide them with all assistance, without the conference itself seeking to formulate a solution. Such direct negotiations will help to confine the Indochina issue to those disputes that are relevant to and directly involved in Indochina. The above parties are the same as the parties that constitute the ceasefire group.

      (5) Non-interference. The conference should reach a solemn agreement on non-interference, stipulating that no direct or indirect assistance should be provided to the belligerent parties, or for war purposes, in the form of troops or war materials. In this agreement, the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom, and China should be the main parties. This decision of the conference should be reported to the United Nations, and the United Nations should be requested to draft a convention on non-interference in Indochina, which should embody the aforementioned agreement and include provisions on the implementation of the agreement under the auspices of the United Nations. Other countries should be invited by the United Nations to participate in this non-interference convention.

      (6) The United Nations should be informed of the progress of the conference. The mediation of the United Nations should be sought for the purpose of reconciliation in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the United Nations Charter, rather than for initiating sanctions.

    "The Indian government makes these suggestions with great humility and sincerely hopes that these suggestions will receive the attention of the entire conference and every party concerned. The Indian government believes that the steps it has proposed are practical and can be implemented immediately.

    "The other path is terrible. Is it not time for all of us, especially for those who hold the reins of world affairs on one side or the other, to 'realize that peace cannot exist in a relationship of vexing and costly mutual fear'? These are words spoken by the (Catholic) Pope, words that I believe cannot be improved upon."

    印度总理尼赫鲁在印度国会人民院
    发表关于印度支那问题的声明
    【新华社讯】据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁二十四日在印度国会人民院发表关于印度支那问题的声明。声明全文如下：
    “如人民院所知，二月间法国、美利坚合众国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和联合王国协议召开有它们自己和中华人民共和国参加的会议，该会议亦将邀请其他有关国家参加，以分别审议朝鲜和印度支那问题。这一会议将于下周在日内瓦开始开会。
    “无论在这一会议或在印度支那激烈进行的战争中，我们都不是参加者。然而我们对印度支那感到关心并深以为虑，特别是关怀其最近的发展。我们亦关怀日内瓦会议应寻求协商解决这一问题并获得成功，俾使战争的阴影得以消散，此种阴影已长期遮蔽我国邻近地区并有扩大和更呈阴暗之虞。
    “如要得到一种唯一可能证明为建设性的并产生成果的态度，必须认识这一问题的基本事实，其所牵涉的民族的和政治的情绪，以及那里的背景和现有的政治上和军事上的局势。
    “印度支那冲突就其起源和基本性质来说，乃是反殖民主义的反抗运动，以及用传统的镇压及分而治之的方法对付这一反抗的企图。
    “外国干涉已使问题更形复杂，但它基本上仍属于反殖民和民族主义的性质。承认这一点并满足要求自由和独立的民族情绪，同时保障他们不受外来压力：唯有这些才能构成解决问题与和平的基础。
    “虽然使用着重武器和进行着大规模战役，冲突本身甚至在今天仍属游击战性质，没有固定或稳定的战线。国土为敌对力量所分割，但没有固守的界线来划分他们的不同地区。大块袋形或条形的土地与人口逐日或在一夕之间互易其手。战争互有胜负，地方互有赢失，但战争年复一年地进行着，越来越凶猛。数百万的印度支那战斗人员以及其他人民，不论他们属于哪一方面，被杀伤，或遭受着其他痛苦，他们的国土被沦为荒凉。
    “在印度支那，对帝国主义的挑战作为一种大规模运动，是于一九四○年反对日本占领而开始的。在对日战争期间，美国和盟国部队曾得到以胡志明为首的越盟（创立于一九四一年）和其他民族主义或其他性质团体的协助。当时的越盟宣言提到“美、苏、英、中对民主原则的保卫”并要求各大国宣布在日本军力被推翻后，印度支那人民将得到充分自治。
    “第二次世界大战后，成立了临时政府，其十五名成员中五名是共产党人，该政府得到温和的民族主义者、天主教徒和其他人士的拥护。胡志明被选为‘越南民主共和国’主席，而共和国系于一九四五年九月宣告成立，并得到当时的中国政府的承认。一九四六年三月六日，战后回到印度支那的法国与胡志明签订了一项协定，承认越南民主共和国“为一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政。并为印度支那联邦和法兰西联邦的一份子。”不过这一协定存在不久。
    “胡志明共和国和法兰西帝国之间的冲突开始于一九四七年并延续至今。一九四八年六月间，法国人与前安南皇帝保大签订协定，使他为法国人所承认为法兰西联邦中一个联邦成员国的越南的元首。法国人并与印度支那的其他两国——寮国和高棉王国缔结了同样的协定。
    “在此阶段，印度支那冲突开始带上了它现在所有的和极不吉祥的一面，即反映着两大阵营的冲突。美国给予法国的物质援助和装备为法国人用于进行印度支那战争。另一方面，越盟虽仍坚称战争为反法国殖民主义的战争，但据报道称，越盟从中华人民共和国得到供应，中华人民共和国政府继续着其前任政府所给予‘越南民主共和国’（越盟）的承认。
    “干涉随干涉而至，战争的猛烈性增加了。谈判日益困难和没有结果。最近几月的发展，就是在这一背景之下发生的。
    “这些发展中的第一个发展，就是四国在柏林决定将此问题交由日内瓦会议审议。我们欢迎这一会议并表示希望它能导致印度支那的和平。我们认为它是一个遵循协商途径谋求解决的决定。当时我曾在一项在本院发表的声明中冒昧呼吁印度支那停火，该声明受到本院一致的欢迎。
    “关于日内瓦会议的决定虽是一个受到欢迎的发展，但是引起我们的忧虑和不祥的预感的发展，不久就接踵而至了。其中包括：
      一、反复地提及立刻的和大规模的报复，提及对中国大陆可能的进攻，以及关于扩大和加紧印度支那战争的言论；
      二、邀请西方国家、美澳新公约国家和某些亚洲国家参加在东南亚的联合的和集体的行动。在这以前即曾发表过若干言论，这些言论接近于承担对东南亚各国的保护或片面地宣布一种对东南亚各国的门罗主义。
    “这样，已经有着迹象，在印度支那有发生直接干涉，发生战争的国际化及其扩大和加剧的危险。
    “召开这样关系重大的会议显然是因为认为谈判是可行的和必要的，而在这次会议之前竟然出现宣布等于表示对这个会议缺乏诚意的言论，宣布要实行含有以制裁相威胁的意思的替代行动的言论，印度政府对这种情况深感遗憾，并且非常关切。在谈判开始以前进行恫吓、威胁、轻蔑和发表缺乏诚意的言论的情况下，谈判已受到妨碍，它开始得不顺利，它的进展将会是一波三折——如果有任何进展的话。
    “另一个必然也使我们更为不安的因素，就是战争步调的加速和在印度支那供应的加紧。对于越盟，显然已有加紧供应的支援，据称这些供应使得越盟能够发动巨大攻势，意在获得军事上的胜利以向对他们有利的方向来左右行将召开的会议，使之对他们有利。对于法国和越南方面，美国的援助已经加紧并且已经提出进一步援助的保证。
    “对于在印度的我们，这些发展是值得严重关切并含有可悲的意义的。它们隐含着对于亚洲各国新近赢得并为他们所珍贵的独立的危害。
    “维持亚洲各国的独立和主权以及结束殖民与外国统治，对于亚洲各国人民的繁荣和世界和平是必需的。
    “我们并不寻求在亚洲担任任何特别的角色，我们也不提倡任何狭隘的和区域性的亚洲地域主义。我们只希望我们自己以及其他国家，特别是我们的邻国成为和平地区，保持在世界紧张局势和战争中不结成同盟或承担约束的政策。我们相信，为了我们自己的缘故，这样作是必要的，而且也只有这样，才能使我们在缓和国际紧张局势，促进裁军和世界和平方面作出我们的贡献。
    “然而，目前的发展在我们的希望之上投下了深深的阴影；它们危及我们的基本政策并想把我们包括到一种同盟中去。
    “对于我们来说，和平不仅是热烈的希望；它是紧急的需要。
    “印度支那是一个亚洲国家和（与印度）邻接的地区。尽管她已遭受重大的牺牲，目前的冲突使她陷入被干涉的处境，使她获得自由的前景遭到危殆。因此，关于印度支那的危机深深地感动了我们，并要求我们拿出最好的思考和努力，以防止这一冲突趋于扩大与加剧而促使其趋于导致解决。
    “印度政府深信，尽管在日内瓦集会的大政治家们以及他们的人民有着不同的观点，他们之间存在着根深蒂固的猜疑，他们所要求的权益相互冲突；但是他们对于避免战争浪潮这一点，具有共同的目的。印度政府本其协助解决若干困难和僵局并促成和平解决的热诚意愿，冒昧地提出下列建议：
      （一）和平与协商的气氛必须予以促进，猜疑心理及目下流行的威胁气氛必须予以消除。为此目的，印度政府吁请所有的有关各方停止进行威胁，并吁请交战各方勿加紧战争步调。
      （二）停火。为实现此点，印度政府建议：甲、‘停火’一项在印度支那会议的议程中应给予优先地位。乙、停火小组由实际交战各方，即法国及其三联邦成员国和越盟组成。
      （三）独立。会议应决定并宣布，对冲突的解决极其重要的一点是：印度支那的完全独立，即：法国的主权的终止，应由法国政府承担毫不含糊的义务而不容置疑地加以确定。
       （四）会议应发起直接有关与主要有关各方之间的直接谈判。会议应请求主要有关各方进入直接谈判，并为此目的给予它们一切协助，而不由会议本身寻求制订解决办法。这种直接谈判将有助于使印度支那问题局限于那些有关并且直接牵涉到印度支那的争端。上述各方与构成停火小组的各方同。
      （五）不干涉。会议应达成一个关于不干涉的庄严协议，规定不以军队或战争物资对交战方面、或为了战争目的提供直接的或间接的援助，在这一协议中，美国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、联合王国和中国应为主要各方。会议的这一决定应报告给联合国，并请联合国草拟一项关于不干涉印度支那的公约，该公约应体现前述协议并包括关于在联合国主持下实施该协议的各项规定。其他国家应由联合国邀请参加此项不干涉公约。
      （六）联合国应获悉关于会议的进展情况。联合国的斡旋应予觅致，其目的在于根据联合国宪章的适当条款进行和解，而不是为了发起制裁。
    “印度政府十分谦虚地提出这些建议，并热诚地愿望这些建议会得到会议全体及有关的每一方的注意。印度政府认为，它所提议的步骤是实际可行的，并能够立即付诸实施。
    “另一条道路是可怕的。对我们大家，特别是对那些在一方面或另一方面掌握着世界事务之舵的人们来说，现在难道不是时候，应该‘了解到，和平是不能存在于一种令人气恼的、代价浩大的相互恐惧的关系之中的’吗？这是（天主教）教皇所说的我认为不能再有所增益的话。”
