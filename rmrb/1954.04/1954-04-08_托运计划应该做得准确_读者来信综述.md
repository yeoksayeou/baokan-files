Shipping Plans Should Be Accurate
——Reader Letters Summary

Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that some economic production departments do not pay enough attention to railway transportation plans and that shipping plans are extremely inaccurate, causing chaos in railway transportation and wasting transportation capacity. Wang Xiuzheng of the Transportation Planning Department of the Ministry of Railways wrote that in January and February of this year, the actual number of railcars loaded was more than 39,000 less than planned, of which 80 percent was due to inaccurate plans made by the shipping units. For example, in January, the China Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Company requested 462 cars from the Tianjin Transportation Bureau, but only 358 cars were actually completed; in February, it requested 301 cars, but 133 cars were left empty. Another example is the Tianjin Petroleum Company, which submitted a car request plan for 1,008 cars in January, with 393 cars not completed; in February, it requested 423 cars, but only 303 cars were actually completed. Readers Wu Jingxin and Huang Yulin wrote that shipping units in Jiamusi City only completed 69.9 percent of the railway transportation plan last year, with 5,318 cars left empty within the plan. As a result, the railway department received fines from various units totaling 622.235 million yuan.

It is worth noting that some enterprises are unable to complete the planned number of cars on the one hand, but frequently request temporary cars from the Ministry of Railways on the other hand. For example, in February, the China Oils and Fats Company requested 186 cars from the Zhengzhou Transportation Bureau, actually using 78 cars; however, it requested another 159 cars outside the plan. Another example is that the Jiamusi Station allocated 6,223.5 cars for unplanned transportation last year. This further exacerbated the chaos in railway transportation order.

The above situation of wasting railcars shows that some enterprises often have the idea of "planning wide and using narrow" when making plans. Reader Zhu Ce wrote that in January, the Xuzhou wholesale station of the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative requested 67 cars from the railway. After the railway conducted in-depth investigations, it was confirmed that the station only had the certainty to load 33 cars. The Freight Department of the Datong Transportation Bureau wrote that the Beijing Native Produce Company frequently failed to complete the shipping plan. In January, only 30 percent of the car request plan was completed; however, in February, although the source of goods had not yet been determined, and no purchase contract had been signed with the entrusted agency, it requested 25 cars from the railway without any certainty. According to readers' letters, the situations in the above examples are quite common.

The railway transportation plan is part of the national economic plan. If this plan is inaccurate, it will cause difficulties in the railway's own planning management and fail to achieve balanced transportation; more seriously, it will reduce the vehicle turnover rate and waste transportation capacity. This year, the national transportation task is particularly heavy, and the railway transportation capacity cannot yet adapt to the ever-increasing needs of national economic development. If the phenomenon of inaccurate shipping plans cannot be quickly corrected, it will make transportation capacity even more insufficient and affect the completion of the production and basic construction plans of other enterprise departments. Therefore, all shipping units should correct their understanding of railway planned transportation and strive to make the shipping plan accurate, and relevant leading units should also strictly review the shipping plans of their subordinate grassroots units. The railway department should actively improve transportation efficiency, strengthen the organization of cargo sources, and urge shippers to submit and implement shipping plans on time to ensure that railway transportation better serves the national economy.

### 托运计划应该做得准确——读者来信综述

    托运计划应该做得准确
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到不少读者来信，反映某些经济生产部门不重视铁路运输计划，托运计划极不准确，造成铁路运输工作的混乱与运输力的浪费现象。铁道部运输计划处王秀峥来信说：今年一、二月份铁路实际装车数比计划少了三万九千多车，其中百分之八十是由于托运单位所订计划不准确所致。如中国花纱布公司一月份向天津运输分局要车四百六十二辆，实际只完成三百五十八车；二月份要车三百零一辆，有一百三十三车落了空。又如天津市石油公司一月份提出一千零八车的要车计划，有三百九十三车未完成；二月份要车四百二十三辆，实际完成仅三百零三车。读者吴景新、黄玉林来信反映：佳木斯市的托运单位去年仅完成铁路运输计划百分之六十九点九，计划内有五千三百十八车落了空。因此，铁路方面收到各单位的罚款即达六亿二千二百三十五万元。
    值得引起注意的是某些企业单位一方面不能完成计划内的要车数字，另方面却又经常向铁道部临时要车。如中国油脂公司二月份向郑州运输分局要车一百八十六辆，实际用七十八车；可是在计划外却又要了一百五十九车。又如佳木斯车站去年一年内为计划外运输拨车达六千二百二十三点五辆。这就愈加造成了铁路运输秩序的混乱。
    以上浪费车皮的情况说明某些企业单位在编制计划时往往存在着“宽打窄用”的思想。读者朱册来信说：江苏省合作总社徐州批发站一月份向铁路要车六十七辆，经过铁路深入了解，该站确有把握的实际装车数只是三十三辆。大同运输分局车务科来信：北京市土产公司经常不能完成托运计划，一月份的要车计划只完成了百分之三十；但二月份虽然货源尚无着落，并且也没有与委托机关订立代购合同，就毫无把握地向铁路要车二十五辆。根据读者来信反映，上面所举例子中的情况是相当普遍的。
    铁路运输计划是国民经济计划的一部分。如果这个计划不准确，就会造成铁路本身计划管理的困难，达不到平衡运输；更严重的是会减少车辆周转率，造成运输力的浪费。今年国家运输任务特别繁重，而铁路运输能力还不能适应国家经济发展日益增长的需要。如果托运计划不准确的现象不能迅速纠正，就会使运输力更形不足，影响其他企业部门的生产和基本建设计划的完成。所以各托运单位应该改正对铁路计划运输的认识，力求把托运计划做得准确，有关领导单位也应对所属基层单位的托运计划严加审核。铁路部门则应积极提高运输效率，加强组织货源工作，督促货主按期提出和执行托运计划，以保证铁路运输更好地为国民经济服务。
