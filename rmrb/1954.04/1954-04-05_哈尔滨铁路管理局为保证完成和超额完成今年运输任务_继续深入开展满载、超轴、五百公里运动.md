Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 4th: To ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's heavy transportation tasks, the Harbin Railway Bureau has decided to continue deeply promoting the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements throughout the entire railway system. In the first quarter of this year, many sections, stations, chartered car groups, and drivers under the Harbin Railway Bureau have already achieved outstanding results. In the first half of March, the Harbin Locomotive Depot exceeded the axle load limit 283 times, hauling 111,281 tons more than stipulated and saving 62 locomotives. From February 9th to 23rd, the Wafangdian Station Locomotive Depot had 130 over-axle trains, of which 20 trains hauled more than 300 tons above the limit. During this period, Han Zhen, the driver of locomotive No. 1063 in the depot, was able to haul more on every trip. In February, the Liaoyang Station had 165 over-axle trains, hauling 66,170 tons more, saving the state the cost of running 82 freight trains.

To continue deeply promoting the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements throughout the railway system, the Harbin Railway Bureau held a telephone conference on March 19th and made specific arrangements. The conference emphasized that the key to deeply promoting this movement lies in improving the quality of locomotives, raising the political, technical, and cultural level of locomotive crews, and advocating more frequent hauling of over-axle trains, without excessively demanding the tonnage of each over-axle haul.

The full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements are mass movements that can unleash the creativity of railway workers, tap potential, and leverage existing equipment capacity. This movement was initiated and developed by Zheng Xikun, Wang Jikui, Yang Maolin, and Li Xikui, advanced drivers, weighers, and shunting operators of the original Chinese Changchun Railway, under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. In 1952, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government promoted this movement throughout the country's railways and achieved great results. In 1953, the Harbin Railway Bureau consolidated the advanced experience of the original Chinese Changchun Railway and continued to carry out the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements. Throughout the year, 39.4 percent of the operating locomotives became five hundred kilometer locomotives, and all operating locomotives hauled a total of 21,833 over-axle trains, hauling 705,380 tons more. As a result, the actual volume of goods transported throughout the year increased by 1.56 million tons compared to the original plan, and 54,500 wagons were saved.

    哈尔滨铁路管理局为保证完成和超额完成今年运输任务
    继续深入开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
   【新华社哈尔滨四日电】哈尔滨铁路管理局为了保证完成与超额完成今年繁重的运输任务，决定在全路继续深入开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动。今年第一季度，哈尔滨铁路管理局所属很多段、站和包车组、司机已创造了优异的成绩。哈尔滨机务段三月上、中旬超轴二百八十三次，比规定多拉了十一万一千二百八十一吨，节省了六十二台机车。瓦房店站机务段自二月九日到二十三日，有一百三十趟超轴列车，其中二十趟列车都比规定多拉了三百吨以上。在这个期间，该段一零六三号机车司机长韩珍每趟车都能多拉。辽阳站二月份超轴一百六十五列车，多拉六万六千一百七十吨，给国家节省了开行八十二列货物列车的费用。
    为了在全路继续深入开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，哈尔滨铁路管理局在三月十九日召开电话会议，作了具体布置。会议强调深入开展这一运动的关键在于改善机车质量，提高机车乘务员的政治、技术、文化水平，提倡牵引超轴列车的次数要多，而不过多要求每次超轴牵引的吨数。
    满载、超轴、五百公里运动是一种群众性运动，能够发挥铁路职工创造精神，发掘潜力，发挥现有设备能力。这一运动是原中长铁路先进司机郑锡坤、王吉奎、司磅员杨茂林和调车员李锡奎等，在苏联专家具体教导下，带头发起和开展起来的。中央人民政府铁道部一九五二年曾在全国铁路上推广了这一运动，并取得很大成绩。一九五三年，哈尔滨铁路管理局巩固原中长铁路的先进经验，继续开展了满载、超轴、五百公里运动，全年有百分之三十九点四的运用机车成为五百公里机车，全部运用机车共牵引超轴列车两万一千八百三十三列，多拉了七十万五千三百八十吨，从而使全年实际装运的货物比原计划增加了一百五十六万吨，并节省了五万四千五百个车皮。
