CIO President Reuther Says: There are Five Million Unemployed in the United States
    CIO President Reuther announced at a meeting of the CIO Automobile and Aircraft Workers Union that there are now five million unemployed in the United States. Reuther said that government officials' optimism about the economic situation is the same as the optimism shown by Herbert Hoover's government in 1929, and at that time, a catastrophic economic crisis had already begun.
    According to the United Steelworkers of America President McDonald to representatives of the press, approximately sixteen percent of the workers belonging to the union, or close to 200,000 workers, have been unemployed. Most of these workers lost their jobs in the last two months. In addition, thousands of workers only have part-time work.

Courts and "Debt Collection Companies" Serving Creditors are Getting Busy
    Lawsuits to recover debts due to people's inability to repay them have greatly increased throughout the United States compared to last year.
    According to the "Wall Street Journal," the St. Louis Circuit Court alone has accepted 259 cases of debt collection lawsuits since the beginning of this year, an increase of nearly 40 percent compared to the same period last year. In San Francisco, Detroit, Cleveland, and other cities, court clerks similarly point out that cases of debt collection are increasing rapidly. At the same time, the amount of debt owed by the American people is also increasing. According to an employee of the Bank of America in San Francisco, the amount of debt owed by the American people due to the purchase of appliances and automobiles has increased by 50 percent compared to last year, and is 10 percent higher than three months ago.
    Due to the increase in the number of Americans defaulting on debts, the business of agencies in the United States that specialize in collecting debts for creditors has greatly increased. An employee of a debt collection company in Chicago said: "In the past thirty to sixty days, the number of accounts entrusted to us for collection has had a frightening increase." The employee also said: "In our twenty-seven years of operation, we have never seen this situation." In order to repay debts, the American people have had to return the goods they bought to the company or have the creditors take them away to pay off debts. In major cities such as Detroit, Boston, and Pittsburgh, the situation where creditors or companies take away goods as payment for debts due to the inability to repay loans or payments for goods has increased compared to last year. It is pointed out that the increase in unemployment and the reduction in working hours are the main reasons why it is not easy to recover debts. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国际简讯
    产联主席路德说：美国现有五百万人失业
    美国产业工会联合会主席路德在产联汽车与飞机工人工会的一次会议上宣布，美国现在有五百万人失业。路德说，政府官员对经济情况所表现的乐观主义，和一九二九年赫伯特·胡佛政府所表现的乐观主义一样，而在当时，灾难性的经济危机已经开始了。
    据美国联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳对报界代表称，属于该工会的大约有百分之十六的工人，或接近二十万工人已经失业。其中大多数工人都是在最近两个月内失去工作的。此外，还有成千的工人只在部分时间有工作。
    为债主服务的法院和“催帐公司”忙起来了
    在美国各地因人民无力偿付债务而引起的追索债务的诉讼比去年大大增加了。
    据“华尔街日报”报道：今年以来仅圣路易巡回法院就受理了二百五十九件追索欠款的诉讼案子，和去年同期比较增加了将近百分之四十。在旧金山、底特律、克利夫兰及其他城市，法院职员同样指出追索欠款的案子飞速地在增加。同时，美国人民拖欠借款的数目也在增加。据旧金山的一位美利坚银行职员说，美国人民由于购买用具和汽车而拖欠借款的数目，比起去年来增加了百分之五十，比三个月前高出百分之十。
    由于美国人民拖欠债务的情形增加，在美国专为替债主催帐而设的代办所的业务大大增加。一位芝加哥的催帐公司职员说：“在过去三十天到六十天时间内，交托给我们催索的帐目的数目有可怕的增加。”这位职员又说：“在我们二十七年来的营业中，从来也没有见过这种情况。”美国人民为了还债，不得不将买来的货物退还给公司或者给债主拿走抵债。在底特律、波士顿和匹兹堡这些大城市中，因为无力偿还借款或货款因而被债主或公司拿走货物作抵债的情形比去年都有增加。据指出：失业的增加和工作时间的减少，是不容易收回欠款的主要原因。（新华社）
