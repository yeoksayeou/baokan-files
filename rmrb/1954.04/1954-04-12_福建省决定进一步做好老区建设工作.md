Fujian Province's Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committee convened its fourth Old Area Work Conference in mid-March to review past work in the old areas and determine the direction and tasks for future work.

The conference, based on the general line of the state during the transition period and the actual situation of the old areas in the province, determined the guiding principles and tasks for future work in the old revolutionary base areas: It should continue to vigorously publicize and implement the general line, strengthen political work in the old areas, and call on the people of the old areas to continue to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, with the development of production and mutual aid cooperation as the center of the work in the old revolutionary base areas, and pay attention to combining the handling of outstanding construction issues, and do a good job in the old areas' township division, transportation, culture and education, health, preferential treatment and other work. It is required that through in-depth publicity and education of the general line, the socialist consciousness of the people in the old areas should be further enhanced, so as to promote the development of the production mutual aid and cooperation movement in the old areas, so that it can better adapt to the requirements of national economic construction, and gradually improve the lives of the people in the old areas on the basis of developing production.

In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government, the old revolutionary base area work in Fujian Province has achieved remarkable results. In the past year, the state allocated funds for old area construction, which helped the masses in the old areas build 460 water conservancy projects, which can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land; restore 340 bamboo shoot factories and paper mills, reclaim more than 6,700 mu of tea mountains and bamboo mountains, add more than 3,800 pieces of major agricultural tools, and help solve the problem of 54,400 jin of seeds, and at the same time, help the masses in the old revolutionary base villages build 8,185 new houses and repair 8,190 houses, solving the problem of housing shortage for more than 6,400 households and 23,000 people. At present, the unit area yield of agricultural production in the old areas has generally recovered or exceeded the level of the Second Revolutionary Civil War period; the production of local specialties such as timber, tea, dried bamboo shoots, and paper has also been greatly restored. Under the principle of rectification and consolidation, production mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the old areas have been improved and developed last year. Now the organized farmers account for more than 50% of the total farmers. Last year, 41 agricultural production cooperatives were piloted in the old areas. Supply and marketing and credit cooperative organizations have also developed. In terms of transportation, nine highways with a total length of more than 920 kilometers have been built in the past two years; at the same time, 111 bridges and 34 roads have been built; production and transportation in the old areas have become more convenient than in the past. In terms of culture, education and health, schools have been added to the old area base villages with better conditions, and medical teams have been organized in various counties to go deep into the old areas for free treatment. On the basis of production recovery and development, the lives of the people in the old areas have been greatly improved. The people in the old areas with glorious revolutionary traditions actively sell surplus grain to support the country's economic construction when the state purchases grain. According to statistics from 36 old area townships in Jianyang Special District, a total of 8,071,016 jin of surplus grain were sold, exceeding the original planned purchase figure by more than 320,000 jin.

    福建省决定进一步做好老区建设工作
    福建省老根据地建设委员会在三月中旬召开第四次老区工作会议，检查过去老区工作，确定今后工作的方针和任务。
    会议根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和该省老区实际情况，确定了今后老根据地工作的方针任务：应继续大力宣传贯彻总路线，加强老区政治工作，号召老区人民在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中继续“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，以发展生产互助合作为老根据地工作的中心，并注意结合处理修建遗留问题，做好老区划乡、交通、文教、卫生、优抚等工作。要求通过总路线的深入宣传教育工作，进一步提高老区人民的社会主义觉悟，以促进老区生产互助合作运动的发展，使之更好地适应国家经济建设的要求，并在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善老区人民的生活。
    过去一年来，福建省老根据地工作在省委与省人民政府的正确领导下，已获得了显著的成绩。仅去年国家拨出的老区建设费一项，即帮助老区群众兴修水利四百六十处，可灌溉土地十万多亩；恢复笋厂、纸槽三百四十座，垦复茶山、竹山六千七百多亩，添置主要农具三千八百多件、帮助解决种籽五万四千四百多斤，同时帮助了老革命基点村群众新建房屋八千一百八十五间，修理房屋八千一百九十间，解决了六千四百多户、二万三千多人无房或缺房居住的困难。目前老区农业生产单位面积产量一般已恢复或超过了第二次国内革命战争时期的水平；土特产生产如木材、茶叶、笋干、纸等也都有很大的恢复。老区生产互助合作组织去年在整顿、巩固为主的方针下，有了提高和发展，现在组织起来的农户已占总农户百分之五十以上。去年在老区试办了四十一个农业生产合作社。供销、信用合作组织也有发展，在交通运输方面，前年去年共修建了公路九条，全长达九百二十多公里；同时修建桥梁一百十一座、道路三十四条；老区生产运输比过去已方便了一些。在文教、卫生方面，条件较好的老区基点村已增设学校，各县并普遍组织医疗队深入老区巡回免费治疗。老区人民在生产恢复与发展的基础上，生活已有很大的改善，具有光荣革命传统的老区人民，在国家收购粮食时踊跃出卖余粮，支援国家的经济建设，据建阳专区三十六个老区乡的统计共出卖余粮八百零七万一千零十六斤，超出原计划收购数字三十二万多斤。
