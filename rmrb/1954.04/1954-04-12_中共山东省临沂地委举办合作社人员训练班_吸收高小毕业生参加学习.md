    CPC Shandong Provincial Linyi Prefectural Committee Holds Cooperative Personnel Training Class
    Enrolling Senior Elementary School Graduates to Participate in Learning
    The CPC Shandong Provincial Linyi Prefectural Committee, recognizing that a large number of senior elementary school graduates are now a new force on the agricultural front and must be attracted to participate in the agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation movement to give full play to their role, has decided to train and cultivate some senior elementary school graduates who have already joined agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams, making them the backbone of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Recently, the Prefectural Committee held the third agricultural production cooperative personnel training class, enrolling a total of 168 senior elementary school graduates who had joined agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams. Among them, there were 78 agricultural production cooperative accountants, 1 mutual aid team leader, 15 mutual aid team bookkeepers, and the rest were mutual aid team members.
    During the learning process, they further raised their awareness, recognized the future of agricultural development, as well as the important significance of the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production, and criticized the idea of being uneasy about agricultural production. Generally, they were able to study actively. For example, Lu Guirong achieved good results in the business examination, with scores above 80 in each subject.
    After studying, they further established their determination to participate in agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Many senior elementary school graduates expressed that after returning, they would resolutely do a good job as accountants or other jobs, actively participate in labor, and run the cooperatives and mutual aid teams well.

    中共山东省临沂地委举办合作社人员训练班
    吸收高小毕业生参加学习
    中共山东省临沂地委鉴于大批的高小毕业生已是农业战线上的新生力量，必须吸引他们参加到农业生产与互助合作运动中来，充分发挥其作用。因此，决定将部分已参加农业生产合作社或互助组的高小毕业生加以训练、培养，使其成为农业生产与互助合作运动中的骨干。
    最近，地委举办了第三期农业生产合作社人员训练班，吸收已参加农业生产合作社或互助组的高小毕业生共一百六十八人。其中，有农业生产合作社会计七十八人，互助组长一人，互助组记账员十五人，其余的都是互助组员。
    在学习中，他们进一步提高了觉悟，认识了农业发展前途，以及农业的社会主义改造和发展农业生产的重要意义，批判了不安心农业生产的思想。一般都能积极学习。如陆贵荣在业务考试中，成绩良好，各课成绩都在八十分以上。
    经过学习以后，他们进一步树立了参加农业生产和农业的社会主义改造的决心。不少高小毕业生表示回去以后，坚决做好会计或其它工作，积极参加劳动，把合作社、互助组办好。
