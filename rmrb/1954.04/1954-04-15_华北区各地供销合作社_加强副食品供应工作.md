North China Area Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
Strengthen Non-Staple Food Supply Work

Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the North China region are actively strengthening the supply of non-staple foods. Many areas have seen cooperatives establishing more non-staple food supply organizations. In Tangshan City, Hebei Province, grassroots consumer cooperatives have universally added non-staple food departments or specialized stalls. In Beijing and Tianjin, many cooperative distribution points have added vegetable departments and established close ties with the mess halls of government organizations. Cooperatives in various regions have also increased the variety of non-staple foods they handle, according to the needs of local residents. The Baoding City Cooperative in Hebei Province has newly added vegetables, fresh goods, fish, candy, and dried seafood like dried shrimp and jellyfish. Grassroots cooperatives in the Tangshan area have generally added from twenty to over a hundred kinds of non-staple foods. In order to secure sources of non-staple foods, the Beijing Municipal Cooperative Federation organized a group of cadres to go to the Southwest, Central South, East China, Northeast, and North China regions to make purchases. Many commodities such as cured meat, pressed duck, chicken, fish, shrimp, dried fruit, and fresh fruit have now been transported back. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative Federation also sent cadres to East China and other places to actively organize sources of goods. Contracts for purchasing tea and sugarcane, among other commodities, have been signed and are currently being transported. (Xu Muzhen)

    华北区各地供销合作社
    加强副食品供应工作
    华北区各地供销合作社积极加强副食品供应工作。许多地区的合作社增设了副食品供应机构。河北省唐山市各基层消费合作社普遍增设了副食品部或专业货摊；北京、天津两市不少合作社分销处增加了青菜部，并和机关伙食团建立了密切的联系。各地合作社还根据当地居民需要，增添了副食品经营品种。河北省保定市合作社新增了菜蔬、鲜货、鱼类、糖果及海米、海蜇等商品；唐山专区各基层合作社一般都增加了二十余种到一百多种副食品。为了掌握副食品货源，北京市合作总社组织了一批干部分赴西南、中南、华东、东北及华北各地进行采购，现已运回腊肉、板鸭、鸡、鱼、虾、干果、鲜果等许多商品。河北省合作总社也派出干部分赴华东等地积极组织货源，现已签订购买茶叶、甘蔗等商品的合同，正在进行调运中。　（许慕贞）
