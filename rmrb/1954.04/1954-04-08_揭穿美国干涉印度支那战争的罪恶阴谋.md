Exposing the Sinister Conspiracy of U.S. Intervention in the Indochina War
	*L'Humanité* Editorial Points Out: U.S. Aims to Create Tension

*L'Humanité* of Paris published an editorial on March 31st, commenting on Dulles's speech on March 29th. The editorial pointed out that it is very clear that the American rulers, in order to try to intensify international tensions, are sparing no expense to prevent the Geneva Conference from succeeding. As the date of the Geneva Conference approaches, Dulles tells France that the issue is not only about restoring peace in Indochina; for the United States, the issue is the imperative to expand the war. It can be foreseen that from now until the opening of the Geneva Conference, such conspiracies will increase. Dulles's speech should be seen as a warning to the French people, that is to say, Dulles's threats and the treacherous behavior of the French rulers risk leading to disaster.

The editorial said: The success of the Geneva Conference depends on the pressure of the people, which has already enabled the Berlin Conference to achieve preliminary results. The success of the Geneva Conference depends on the French people's actions to fight for peace in Indochina.

British *Socialist Outlook* Weekly Points Out: The United States Wants to Keep the People of Southeast Asia as Slaves

The British *Socialist Outlook* weekly published an article entitled "Hands Off Indochina!"

The weekly quoted many American politicians as saying that the outcome of the Indochina War is "not only a matter of concern to France, but also very important to the United States." The weekly said: "This is the same tactic that was played in Korea. This is an indispensable condition for the United Nations to take 'action policy' again…According to this policy of aggression, American diplomats are exerting great pressure on France to avoid any possible peace talks proposed by Paris."

The weekly said, "The United States and their British echoers oppose any armistice in Indochina…They want to sacrifice some Americans and Britons in addition to hundreds of thousands of French people. Why? In order to keep the people of Southeast Asia as slaves of foreign imperialism, and to keep the wealthy countries of these people continuing to extract their wealth for colonial exploiters to profit from...The United States, on the one hand, refuses to accept a truce, and on the other hand, is preparing its only answer – expanding the war."

The weekly called on Labor Party members to protest the United States' plan to expand the war in Indochina.

West German *Deutsche Volkszeitung* Commentary Points Out: Dulles Fears Consultations in Geneva

The *Deutsche Volkszeitung*, the organ of the German League for Unity, Peace and Freedom, published in Dusseldorf, West Germany, published a commentary on April 3rd, entitled "Sabotage of the Geneva Conference is Doomed to Fail."

The commentary said: Representatives of American foreign policy fundamentally dislike consultations. They want to go their own way and only use their partners as spiritual and material stakes in their dangerous game to seize world hegemony. The commentary pointed out that Dulles and his staff went to Berlin to hold the Four-Power Conference only under duress. At the Berlin Conference, it was decided to convene a five-power conference in Geneva, with the People's Republic of China participating on an equal footing with the other four major powers. The commentary said: The participation of People's China in the Geneva Conference means – whether the United States admits it or not – the participation of the People's Republic of China in international diplomacy. Dulles feels this is a defeat for the United States. That's right. The talks that began in Berlin will continue in Geneva. Dulles fears that the consultations in Geneva and the possible results will finally make the United States' diplomatic policy concepts towards Asia and Europe appear absurd, and bring the crisis of American foreign policy to a climax.

The commentary continued: The conference is about to be held, and it will not be easy for the U.S. Secretary of State to obstruct the further easing of international tensions that has already been eased by the Berlin Conference...The easing of international tensions in Asia will also ease Europe, thereby leading to renewed efforts to achieve German unification.

The fact that the Geneva Conference will begin on April 26th is itself a further victory for the policy of consultation over the "policy of strength."

Prague *Rudé Právo* Review States: The United States Brazenly Violates the Wishes of All Mankind

*Rudé Právo* wrote in its weekly review of the world situation on the 4th: Certain ruling groups in the United States believe that the United States' continuous supply of machine guns, bombs, napalm bombs, airplanes, military experts, machines, and air force personnel to Indochina is a way to consolidate its control over the Indochina market and seize an important war base for attacking People's China and other countries in Asia.

*Rudé Právo* said: The United States' intensified intervention in the Indochina War shows that although all mankind emphatically demands that world peace be guaranteed through negotiations and agreements, and although peace-loving people harbor such aspirations for the Geneva Conference, the United States is not willing to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue.

*Rudé Právo* commented on Dulles's speech on March 29th, in which Dulles called for "joint action by the free world" to contain the growing strength of the Indochina People's Army. *Rudé Právo* said: "The United States' proposal for 'joint action' against Indochina once again exposes the United States' war policy in the face of peace-loving people. Whether Washington likes it or not, this policy will only further isolate the most arrogant American aggressive groups."

*People's World* of San Francisco Editorial Points Out: The American People Do Not Want the Indochina War

The San Francisco *People's World* published an editorial on the 2nd, commenting on Dulles's speech on March 29th.

The editorial said: The American people must pay attention to the serious situation caused by Dulles's speech. Dulles insists that if the people of Indochina achieve victory in their independence movement, the United States will be threatened. He said that the United States must invest all its strength in this dirty war to keep Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia in a colonial state.

Why does Dulles want to issue such a malicious statement now? The purpose of this statement is to force France to continue the dirty war, regardless of the demands of the vast majority of people for peace, and to undermine the chances of the Geneva Conference, which will be held this month, succeeding.

The editorial pointed out that *The New York Times* also revealed another reason, which is: to deceive the American people into participating in this war, to make them step by step fall into the war, so that they have no chance to deal with this issue decisively.

The editorial emphasized: The American people's answer to all this is: Mr. Dulles, we do not want your Indochina war. Let us demand: the United States stop interfering in Indochina, and Dulles and Eisenhower agree at the Geneva Conference to establish peace in Indochina.

### 揭穿美国干涉印度支那战争的罪恶阴谋

专栏：

    揭穿美国干涉印度支那战争的罪恶阴谋
     法国“人道报”社论指出：美国的目的在于制造紧张局势
    巴黎“人道报”三月三十一日发表社论，评论杜勒斯三月二十九日发表的演说。社论指出：非常明显，美国统治者们为了设法加剧国际紧张局势，正不惜任何代价阻止日内瓦会议获得成功。当此接近日内瓦会议会期的时候，杜勒斯告诉法国说，问题不仅不在于恢复印度支那的和平，对美国来说，问题是在于势在必行的扩大战争。可以预见到的是：从现在起到日内瓦会议开幕时为止，这种阴谋诡计将越来越多。杜勒斯的演说应该说是对法国人民的警告，这就是说，杜勒斯的威胁和法国统治者的卖国行为有导致灾难的危险。
    社论说：日内瓦会议的成功系于人民的压力，这种压力已使柏林会议获得了初步的结果。日内瓦会议的成功系于法国人民争取印度支那和平的行动。
    英国“社会主义展望”周刊指出：美国想使东南亚人民继续当奴隶
    英国的“社会主义展望”周刊发表了一篇文章，题目是“不要干涉印度支那！”
    周刊引述了许多美国政客的话，他们说印度支那战争的结果“不仅是法国关心的事情，对美国也非常重要”。周刊说：“这就是在朝鲜所玩的那一套手法。这是要联合国再采取‘行动政策’的必不可少的条件……根据这种侵略政策，美国外交官正对法国施以极大的压力，以避免巴黎方面提议的任何可能的和平谈判。”
    周刊说，“美国和他们的英国应声虫反对任何印度支那停战……他们想在牺牲了数十万法国人之外再牺牲一些美国人和英国人。为什么呢？为了使东南亚人民继续做外国帝国主义的奴隶，为了使这些人民的富庶的国家继续拿出它们的财富来供殖民剥削者牟利……美国一方面拒绝接受停战，一方面在准备它的唯一的答复——扩大战争。”
    周刊要求工党党员抗议美国的扩大印度支那战争的计划。
    西德“德国人民报”评论指出：杜勒斯害怕在日内瓦的协商在西德杜塞尔多夫出版的德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟机关报“德国人民报”四月三日发表一篇评论，题目是“对日内瓦会议的破坏是注定要失败的”。
    评论说：美国外交政策的代表人物根本不喜欢协商。他们要一意孤行下去，把它们的伙伴只是用来作为它们夺取世界霸权的危险把戏中的精神上和物质上的赌注。评论指出，杜勒斯和他的人员只是迫不得已才到柏林去开四国会议的。在柏林会议上又决定了在日内瓦召开五大国会议，有中华人民共和国以和其他四个大国平等的地位参加。评论说：人民中国的参加日内瓦会议意味着——不管美国是不是承认——中华人民共和国的参加国际外交。杜勒斯感觉这是美国的失败。不错，是这样。柏林开始的会谈将在日内瓦继续下去。杜勒斯害怕在日内瓦的协商以及可能得到的结果终于会使美国对亚洲和欧洲的外交政策观念显得荒谬，并使美国外交政策的危机达到顶点。
    评论继续说：会议就要举行了，美国国务卿要想阻挠那已因柏林会议而趋于缓和的国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，不会是一件容易的事情……亚洲国际紧张局势的缓和也会使欧洲缓和起来，从而引导到重新努力来实现德国的统一。
    日内瓦会议将于四月二十六日开始举行这个事实，本身就是协商政策对“实力政策”取得的进一步的胜利。
    布拉格“红色权利报”述评指出：美国悍然违反了全人类的愿望
    “红色权利报”在四日发表的每周世界形势述评中写道：美国某些统治集团认为，美国用机枪、炸弹、凝固汽油弹、飞机、军事专家、机器和空军人员源源不断地供应印度支那，是巩固它对印度支那市场的统治和攫取一个进攻人民中国和亚洲其他国家的重要战争基地的办法。
    “红色权利报”说：美国对印度支那战争变本加厉的干涉表明：虽然全人类都强调地要求用谈判和协议的办法来保障世界和平，虽然爱好和平的人民都对日内瓦会议抱着这样的渴望，但是美国并不愿意和平解决印度支那问题。
    “红色权利报”评论了杜勒斯三月二十九日的演说，杜勒斯在演说中要求“自由世界采取联合行动”来抑制印度支那人民军队的越来越大的力量。“红色权利报”说：“美国建议对印度支那采取‘联合行动’，这又一次在爱好和平人民的面前暴露了美国的战争政策。不管华盛顿愿意不愿意，这种政策只会使最狂妄的美国侵略集团更加孤立。”
    旧金山“人民世界报”社论指出：美国人民不要印度支那战争
    旧金山“人民世界报”二日发表社论，评论杜勒斯三月二十九日的演说。
    社论说：美国人民必须注意到杜勒斯的演说所引起的严重局势。杜勒斯硬说，如果印度支那人民在他们的独立运动中取得胜利，美国就要受到威胁。他说，美国必须以全部力量投入这场肮脏的战争，来使印度支那和整个东南亚处于殖民地的地位。
    为什么杜勒斯要在现在发表这样一个恶意的声明呢？这个声明的目的是迫使法国不顾绝大多数人民争取和平的要求，继续进行肮脏的战争，并破坏将在这个月召开的日内瓦会议成功的机会。
    社论指出，“纽约时报”还透露了另一个原因，这就是：要骗美国人民参加这个战争，使他们一步一步地陷入战争，使他们没有断然处理这个问题的机会。
    社论强调说：美国人民对这一切的回答是：杜勒斯先生，我们不要你的印度支那战争。让我们要求：美国停止干涉印度支那，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议上同意在印度支那建立和平。
