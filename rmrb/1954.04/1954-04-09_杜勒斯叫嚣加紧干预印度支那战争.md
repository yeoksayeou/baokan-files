    Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on April 5 regarding the U.S. so-called "Mutual Security Program," is playing a dangerous game of attempting to expand the Indochina War.
    In his speech, Dulles wantonly spread rumors, falsely accusing China of "intervening" in the Indochina War. The purpose of Dulles' doing this is obviously to deceive and mislead world public opinion with this despicable tactic of blaming others, to cover up the U.S.'s guilt in actively intervening in the Indochina War, and to create an excuse for the U.S. to further expand its intervention in the Indochina War.
    The facts prove that it is none other than the U.S. itself that is actively intervening in the Indochina War. Even Dulles' speech provided evidence of the U.S.'s guilt in actively intervening in the Indochina War. Dulles said that last September, the U.S. government reached an "agreement" with the French government to "help implement" the "Navarre Plan" to intensify the Indochina War. According to this plan, the U.S. decided to invest 785 million U.S. dollars in the Indochina War last year, providing "most of the necessary military supplies"; France, as "guaranteed" to the U.S., sent additional French troops to Indochina. According to this plan, Indochinese puppet troops were to be established, and France was to grant the Indochinese puppet government so-called "independence." In discussing these "basic elements" of the "Navarre Plan," Dulles outlined the U.S. policy in Indochina: the U.S. provides dollars while France provides blood to wage the Indochina War, and the U.S. seeks to replace France's position in Indochina by training and equipping Indochinese puppet troops and by obtaining so-called "independence" from France through the Indochinese puppet government.
    In addition to these facts provided in Dulles' speech, the evidence of U.S. intervention in the Indochina War, such as the U.S. bearing nearly 80 percent of the war costs, the U.S. stationing a large military delegation in Indochina, and U.S. Air Force personnel directly participating in Indochina war operations, has long been known to the world. Even the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" admitted on March 19 that the "aid" the U.S. has invested in the Indochina War "has grown to enormous numbers," and "if not in manpower but in materials, Indochina is rapidly becoming another Korea for the United States." The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" carried a message saying, "The French in Indochina say: This is now an American war."
    In this speech, as in his speech on March 29, Dulles not only did not mention a single word about how to restore peace in Indochina, nor a single word about the Geneva Conference, but also openly stated that the U.S. wants to expand its intervention in this war and keep the war going. He tried his best to tout the "Navarre Plan," which has already suffered a serious defeat, and wants to continue implementing this plan. He clamored that the forces of the Indochinese people "must be defeated," and that U.S. allies must follow the U.S. with "united action" to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Geneva Conference and prevent the Indochinese people from gaining independence.
    Although Dulles did not reveal the specific details of the U.S. government's conspiracy to expand its intervention in the Indochina War, some of it has already been revealed by U.S. congressmen and newspapers. Representative John Vorys, acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters after Dulles testified: There are two ways to take so-called "united action": "One is within the United Nations, and the other is outside the United Nations. Both methods are now under study." The "Wall Street Journal" revealed at the end of March that the Eisenhower administration plans to make "no concessions" at the Geneva Conference and "hold on to" Indochina "at all costs." In this plan, the U.S. intends to send troops from Asian puppet states to participate in the Indochina War under the banner of the United Nations. The U.S. is also "prepared to take direct action" and, "if local troops cannot be found," "the U.S. will throw in its troops." According to this plan, the U.S. will "step by step be deeply mired" in the Indochina War.
    Obviously, in order to achieve the U.S.'s goal of expanding its intervention in the Indochina War, Dulles placed particular emphasis in his testimony on pressuring U.S. allies, demanding that they must "stand united" and follow the U.S. He said, "In some countries, some people protest that their governments...submit to others and say that they should...be independent." Obviously, Dulles believes that all capitalist countries should contribute everything for the "overriding interests" of the U.S. However, the vast majority of peace-loving people do not think so. More and more ordinary people are demanding to take the cause of defending peace into their own hands. Dulles' stubborn opposition to negotiation, opposition to peace, and stubborn policy of standing against the people will sooner or later be met with a bloody nose.

### 杜勒斯叫嚣加紧干预印度支那战争

    杜勒斯叫嚣加紧干预印度支那战争
      【新华社七日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯四月五日在美国众议院外交委员会上就美国所谓“共同安全计划”作证时发表的演说，玩着一个美国企图扩大印度支那战争的危险的把戏。
    杜勒斯在他的演说中大肆造谣，诬蔑中国“干预”印度支那战争。杜勒斯这样做的目的，显然企图用这种反咬一口的卑劣手法来欺骗和蒙蔽世界舆论，掩盖美国积极干预印度支那战争的罪责，为美国进一步扩大干预印度支那战争制造借口。
    事实证明，积极干预印度支那战争的不是任何别人，而恰恰是美国自己。甚至在杜勒斯的演说中，也提供了美国积极干预印度支那战争的罪证。杜勒斯说，去年九月，美国政府与法国政府“取得协议”，“帮助执行”加紧进行印度支那战争的“纳瓦尔计划”。根据这个计划，美国在去年决定在印度支那战争中投入了七亿八千五百万美元，提供了“大部分必需的军事物资”；法国如向美国“所保证的那样”，增派了法国军队到印度支那去。根据这个计划，要建立印度支那傀儡军队，法国要给予印度支那傀儡政府以所谓“独立”。杜勒斯在谈到“纳瓦尔计划”的这些“基本因素”时，描划出了美国在印度支那的政策：美国出美元而要法国出鲜血来进行印度支那战争，美国要通过训练及装备印度支那傀儡军队，通过印度支那傀儡政府自法国手中获得所谓“独立”，取法国在印度支那的地位而代之。
    除杜勒斯演说中提供的这些事实外，美国干预印度支那战争的罪证，诸如美国承担了印度支那战争将近百分之八十的战费，美国在印度支那驻扎了庞大的军事代表团，美国空军人员已直接参加印度支那战争行动等，已早为全世界所知悉。甚至美国“基督教科学箴言报”三月十九日也承认，美国投入印度支那战争的“援助”“已发展到巨大的数目”，“如果不就人力而就物资而言，印度支那对美国来说正迅速地变为另一个朝鲜”。“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”刊载一条消息说，“印度支那的法国人说：现在这是美国佬的战争了”。
    杜勒斯在这次演说中和上次三月二十九日发表的演说一样，不但一个字也没有提到如何来恢复印度支那和平问题，一个字也没有提到日内瓦会议，并且公开表明美国要扩大干预这场战争，使战争继续打下去。他竭力替已经遭到严重失败的“纳瓦尔计划”吹嘘，要继续执行这个计划。他叫嚣着“必须挫败”印度支那人民力量，美国的盟国必须以“联合行动”跟随美国来阻挠日内瓦会议和平解决问题，并阻止印度支那人民获得独立。
    虽然杜勒斯没有透露美国政府企图扩大干预印度支那战争的阴谋的具体内容，但是这也已经为美国众议员及报纸透露出一部分了。众议院外交委员会代理主席、众议员约翰·伏利斯在杜勒斯作证后对记者说：所谓采取“联合行动”有两个办法：“一个是在联合国之内，另一个是在联合国之外。现在对这两个办法都在研究中”。“华尔街日报”在三月底时就透露出艾森豪威尔政府在日内瓦会议上不作“任何让步”，“不惜任何代价保住”印度支那的计划，在这个计划中美国打算在联合国的招牌下派遣亚洲傀儡国家军队去参加印度支那战争。美国并“准备采取直接行动”，在“当地军队找不到时”，“美国是会投进它的军队的”。根据这个计划，美国会“一步一步地深深陷入”印度支那战争。
    显然是为了达到美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的目的，杜勒斯在作证演说里特别着重向美国的盟国施加压力，要它们必须“团结一致”跟着美国走。他说，“在某些国家里，有些人抗议说，他们的政府……屈从别人，并且说它们应当……独立。”显然，杜勒斯认为资本主义各国都应该为了美国的“超乎一切的利益”而贡献他们的一切。但是，广大的爱好和平人民却不会这样想。越来越多的普通人民正要求把保卫和平的事业掌握在自己手中。杜勒斯顽固地反对协商、反对和平，顽固地和人民对立的政策，迟早是要碰得头破血流的。
