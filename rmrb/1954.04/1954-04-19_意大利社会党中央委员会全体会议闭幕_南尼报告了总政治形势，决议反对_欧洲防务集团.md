Xinhua News Agency, Rome, April 15th: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party, which opened in Rome on the 10th, has concluded.

　　Party General Secretary Pietro Nenni gave a report on the general political situation at the meeting. Nenni pointed out: The Social Democratic Party is largely responsible for the current deterioration of the situation in Italy, because without its help, the ruling Christian Democratic group would not be able to ignore the demands for reform put forward by the people in the 1953 parliamentary elections. The current Scelba-Saragat government is pursuing "the most right-wing policy." This policy is "a prelude to the establishment of an alliance based on the Christian Democratic Party, plus the royalists and neo-fascists."

　　Nenni spoke about the reactionary conspiracy to split the alliance between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and pointed out: The prospect of a split between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party is unimaginable, because the minimum condition for the Socialists to support the parliamentary majority or support the government is to meet the demands of all workers. And the Communists' conditions are the same.

　　One of the leaders of the Socialist Party, the editor-in-chief of "Avanti!", Tullio Vecchietti, made a report on the struggle against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. He said that ratifying this treaty would make Italy a colony without dignity and national independence.

　　The resolution adopted at the meeting pointed out that the atmosphere throughout Italy is very tense due to the re-emergence of the four-party coalition government. "Police tyranny and administrative orders have become the means of governing the country." The resolution also pointed out the decline of the Italian economy. In this case, the Italian Socialist Party once again emphasized that there are forces advocating the implementation of a program that can expand the social basis of the republic, establish a new parliamentary majority to complete social progress, and ease domestic and international tensions. It is necessary to change the policy towards these forces.

　　The resolution condemned the government for submitting a bill to parliament regarding the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty, and said: "The Italian Socialist Party, as in the past, once again calls on the country to unite against the policy of war, to demand a policy of coexistence among all countries and all peoples, a policy of easing international tensions and a policy of peace."

    意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议闭幕
    南尼报告了总政治形势，决议反对“欧洲防务集团”
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社罗马十五日讯：十日在罗马开幕的意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议已经闭幕。
    党的总书记彼特罗·南尼在会上作了关于总政治形势的报告。南尼指出：社会民主党在很大程度上要对目前意大利形势的恶化负责，因为没有它的帮助，执政的天主教民主党集团就不能够对人民在一九五三年议会选举中提出的革新要求置之不理。目前谢尔巴—萨拉盖特政府奉行着“最右的政策”。这个政策是“成立以天主教民主党为基础、加上保皇分子和新法西斯分子的联盟的前奏”。
    南尼谈到要分裂社会党与共产党的联盟的反动阴谋，并且指出：社会党和共产党分裂的前景是不能想像的，因为要社会党人支持议会多数派或支持政府的起码条件是：满足所有工人的要求。而共产党人的条件也是这样。
    社会党领袖之一、“前进报”总编辑图里奥·维基耶蒂作了关于反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的斗争的报告。他说：批准这个条约会使意大利沦为没有尊严和民族独立的殖民地国家。
    会议通过的决议指出：由于四党联合政府的再次出现，意大利全国各地的空气很紧张。“警察专横和行政命令已经成为治国的办法。”决议还指出意大利经济的衰退，在这种情况下，意大利社会党再次强调指出：有一些力量主张实行能够扩大共和国的社会基础、能够建立新的议会多数以完成使社会进步、使国内和国际紧张局势缓和的纲领。必须改变对这些力量的政策。
    决议谴责政府向议会提出了一个关于批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的法案，并且说：“意大利社会党像以往一样，再次要求全国团结起来，反对战争政策，要求奉行使世界各国、各族人民共处的政策，奉行缓和国际紧张局势的政策与和平政策。”
