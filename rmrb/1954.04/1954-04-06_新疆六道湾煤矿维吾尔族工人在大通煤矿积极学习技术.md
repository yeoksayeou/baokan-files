Uyghur workers from the Liudaowan Coal Mine in Xinjiang are learning production techniques at the Datong Coal Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau. The Datong Coal Mine takes good care of the Uyghur workers, especially establishing a kitchen for them and providing new eating utensils. A working face was specifically opened for them, with two experienced technicians teaching them production techniques. Han workers at the mine were very happy to see the Uyghur workers, expressing their willingness to teach them all the techniques they knew. Some groups even stipulated that the group meetings every Saturday should include a review of the entire group's concern and assistance for the Uyghur workers.

The Uyghur workers are all very active in their studies. Some of them go to bed very late, but they rush to the early shift in the morning. After three and a half months, they quickly mastered production techniques. For example, Miripu has learned to pave roadways with a radius of 20 meters, and Yiming Mamuti and five others have learned the method of coal mining with wooden plank false roofs and can cooperate with Han workers in their work.

Currently, the Uyghur workers are studying diligently with full confidence. Aimaiti said: For the sake of the country's socialist industrialization, we must study technology well and build our motherland's frontier.

    新疆六道湾煤矿维吾尔族工人在大通煤矿积极学习技术
    新疆六道湾煤矿的一批维吾尔族工人，正在淮南矿务局大通煤矿学习生产技术。大通煤矿对维吾尔族工人照顾得很好，特地给他们成立了伙房，新置了各种饮食用具；专给他们开辟了一个掌子面，由两个老技术工人教他们生产技术。矿场汉族工人见了维吾尔族工人都非常高兴，表示要把自己懂得的技术全部教给他们。有的小组还规定在每星期六的小组会上，检查全组工人对维吾尔族工人的关心和帮助情况。
    维吾尔族工人在学习中都非常积极，有的人睡得很晚，但一早就赶着上早班，经过三个半月的时间，他们很快地掌握了生产技术。如米里甫已会铺二十公尺半径的花道，依明马木提等六人学会了木板假顶采煤法，并能配合汉族工人进行工作了。
    目前，维吾尔族工人正满怀信心地努力学习着。艾买提说：为了国家社会主义工业化，我们一定好好学习技术，去建设祖国的边疆。
