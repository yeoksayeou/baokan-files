    A Trip to Peach Blossom Glade
    Ding Ling
    As dawn was breaking, I couldn't see a single red glow through the glass window. The sky was gray, only the willow branches swayed wildly in the wind, and my heart sank. The weather in the South is never reliable, sometimes raining, sometimes sunny. If it rained again, our plan to go to Peach Blossom Glade would be ruined. Even if we made it, it would be much less interesting. I don't know why, but the eagerness, enthusiasm, and worry I felt as a child waiting to go there were very strong and surrounded me.

    We hurried to get up and busied ourselves preparing breakfast. Many people in the office who saw us also expressed concern, saying, "It's hard to say what the weather will be like today." It seemed they all knew we were going out. It's strange, who asked you about the weather? Anyway, we have to go even if it rains. However, our hearts were indeed like the sky, somewhat gray and uncertain.

    We had agreed with Yang Xinquan yesterday to come to our place at seven o'clock in the morning to have breakfast together, but it was almost eight o'clock, and we had finished breakfast long ago, and he still hadn't arrived. He must not be coming. He must think the weather is bad, so we won't go, and he won't come. He must have already left on his own, without even notifying us, and gone home. These people are really something! I muttered to myself, pacing anxiously under the willow trees in the large courtyard. The cuckoo was calling impatiently in the distance.

    Suddenly, two people came out from under the trees over there. Who was it? The short guy walking behind was none other than Yang Xinquan, the Party branch secretary of Peach Blossom Glade! Although this man is short, he walks nimbly. He walked up to me in a few steps, as if he understood my worries. Before I could ask, he said, "Comrade Ding, you haven't been waiting anxiously, have you? I was taking care of something, that's why I'm late. It's not far, we have plenty of time." After he finished speaking, he unconsciously looked at the sky and added, "It won't rain today, it might even clear up." He smiled naturally after he said that.

    I don't know how it happened, but I immediately believed him and drove away all my worries. My heart suddenly brightened, and I felt that today was a good day. Just like yesterday: Yesterday afternoon, I was very tired and didn't want to do anything, but as soon as Yang Xinquan came in, a few words turned my dull mood into enthusiasm. I immediately accepted his invitation to eat baba. I hadn't had it since I was studying at home thirty years ago. Later, I ate many kinds of rice cakes outside, but I always felt they weren't as good as the baba I ate as a child. Yang Xinquan was going to treat me to baba, the baba I used to eat, which I was so looking forward to and waiting for!

    A group of us took a car to Qili Bridge. I had been to Qili Bridge when I was a child, secretly with a few classmates to watch the rice transplanting. I heard that farmers sing rice-transplanting songs when transplanting rice, so we rushed to see it. We walked very hard, were covered in sweat, and picked many wildflowers, but we didn't hear any singing. I remember it wasn't close to the city, a full seven or eight li, but yesterday Yang Xinquan told me it was right outside the city. I thought at the time that maybe he was right. So much has changed over the years, even the street where we lived as children is gone. It's very possible that Qili Bridge is right on the edge of the city. But we still walked for quite a while before we reached the levee. This levee is of course new, I have never seen it before, but it is still seven or eight li from the city. I didn't ask Yang Xinquan anymore. As for him, as soon as he got to the levee, he greeted many people, and he seemed to have become the host, rushing to arrange for a boat.

    We got on a small awning boat. The old boatman raised his head and looked into the distance as he pushed off with his oar. We were immediately in the middle of the river. The wind blew on the water, creating layers of fish-scale-like ripples, and the oar cut through them again. The boat swayed slightly beneath us, giving us a strange but familiar feeling.

    I thought about how once when I was a child, I also took such a small awning boat to the countryside to escape the "suppression of counter-revolutionaries," with my relatives' daughters, and it seemed to be in the spring too. We didn't understand how the adults were worried about the current situation. As soon as we got on the boat, we were all happy, looking at the sky, looking at the water, looking at the small thatched houses on the shore, looking at the green grass. We had endless things to say and even sang. But an old woman who was taking us scolded us enough. She didn't allow us to stand at the bow of the boat, didn't allow us to talk, didn't allow us to sing, and wanted us to sit tightly in the cabin. She said there were soldiers in the city and secret societies in the countryside, and that we girls simply didn't know what we were doing... But now, I stood at the bow of the boat, leaning against the awning, looking out at the distance where the sky and water met. The wind blew past my ears, and I felt like I was floating on the water on a cloud. I looked at the boatman through the awning, trying to find some old memories, but I couldn't find any. He seemed to be very interested in rowing, and also seemed to be here to play, and also seemed to be sitting on a boat for the first time, full of a sense of self-satisfaction.

    The boat turned past a bridge, and people were looking around. The small river suddenly disappeared, and a large lake was in front of us. Soon we were in the lake. The banks were very wide, and we couldn't see the edge in front of us. This unexpected scene surprised us all. We didn't expect to be boating on the lake today, but it also made us worry about today's journey. How could it be only ten or twenty li as Yang Xinquan said? So someone asked, "Yang Xinquan, how far is it to your house after all?"

    "Not far. Just across the lake."

    "How many li is this lake? Boatman?"

    "This lake, well, it's forty li."

    "No, no," Yang Xinquan quickly defended, "Every time we take a boat, it never takes more than two hours."

    "Two hours? You row, and you won't get there until the sun is overhead."

    Yang Xinquan ignored him, turned his face, and said with a smile, "Comrade Ding, I guarantee it, it won't be late. Look, the sun is out, I said it would clear up today."

    I understood in my heart that he must have told a little lie, but he was sincere. At this time, there were still people pressing him to ask how far Peach Blossom Glade was after all. Yang Xinquan finally had to say that it was less than forty li, only thirty-seven li. When he said thirty-seven li, he didn't explain, as if he had only mentioned the distance for the first time. He just glanced at me quietly.

    He is a very young man, twenty-three years old. His body doesn't seem strong, and you can tell at a glance that he has suffered. His right hand has had some problems since he was a child when he was beaten by the landlord for herding cattle, but he is very capable, full of confidence and joy. You can imagine his changeable, frustrating childhood from his current shrewdness, but you can't find any trace of past bitterness. He was a little beggar, herded cattle at the age of eight, was beaten, and went from one landlord's house to another, working as a farmhand. He has a father, mother, brother, and sister, but he never had a home. They were either farmhands or beggars. Yesterday he told me so frankly, "Now I have truly turned over, I have everything! I have turned over so quickly! My life is not the best in the village, but it's in the middle range. You see, I made a lot of rice cakes before the New Year."

    I told the others who came with me that he had been to Beijing and met Chairman Mao. Everyone applauded him and asked him about his experience in Beijing. He then described in detail his impressions of visiting the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the state-owned farm. I asked the boatman if he knew about these things, and he replied, "How could I not know? Seeing Chairman Mao is not an easy thing. Yang Xinquan was the militia captain at that time. Only one person was selected from a dozen counties in our special district to go to Beijing to participate in the October 1st parade. Chairman Mao also stood on Tiananmen Square and shouted 'Long live the militia comrades' to them. Hundreds of thousands of people marched, it was so lively..." Everyone laughed and asked him, "Did you see it?" He also replied with a smile, "How could I not imagine it? I didn't see it with my own eyes, but I heard it with my own ears. Yang Xinquan gave a report in our village. We are from the same village!"

    When Yang Xinquan was talking to others about the lively scene, the boatman said to me softly: he watched him grow up. When he was a child, he was naked, with a runny nose, and often followed his mother to beg for food, herding cattle for others. He was very capable and obedient, a child who suffered, but he couldn't see any future. After liberation, this child participated in work, became a militia member, became the chairman of the farmers' association, and went here and there. He was a representative for a while, a model for a while, and it was really a bit confusing. Hey, he changed so quickly. Now he can speak and do things; everyone listens to him, and he has quite a bit of prestige.

    When I looked at Yang Xinquan, he was talking about how he participated in the rent reduction and deposit refund work, and how he carried out the land reform. His attitude was not boastful, but natural and ordinary. But his momentum was strong, and his meaning was clear and concise.

    The sun was already high, and we all felt very hot, but Willow Leaf Lake became longer and longer. At this time, Yang Xinquan said nothing. He strode to the bow of the boat, took off his little cotton jacket, and helped to row. He rowed very well, and we immediately overtook several boats. The people on those boats also recognized them and greeted them, looking at us with warm eyes.

    Before twelve o'clock, the boat entered a small fork port and docked on a slope. There was a row of willows drooping down here, with green leaves hanging on the willow branches, gently brushing the surface of the water. We hurriedly walked ashore. At first glance, it was all flat, endless paddy fields, all filled with water, reflecting the white clouds floating in the sky. Large patches of rapeseed fields were thickly covered with yellow flowers, and the wind brought gusts of sweet fragrance. The purple alfalfa in some other fields was also blooming, a pale purple, covering the land like a softer carpet than the rapeseed flowers. A small mountain meandered in the slightly distant place, drawing some lovely lines gently and beautifully in the blue sky. It was densely covered with trees, appearing lush and green. Thousands of net-like field embankments spread out. In our broad minds, we deeply breathed the atmosphere that nourished this black soil, and deeply felt the rich harvest of Peach Blossom Glade, and the peaceful life of our people. We were all stunned, and then we woke up. We all asked at the same time:

      "Where is your home?"
      "Peach Blossom Glade, why haven't we seen any peach blossoms?"
    "Your fields here are really good!"
      Yang Xinquan walked in the front, pointing to a place where a red flag was flying in the distance and said, "That is my home. I live in the side house of the Yang family's ancestral hall. The ancestral hall has a primary school in it. That red flag is the school's."

    We followed him, walking on some winding, narrow, and difficult-to-walk embankments. Some people were digging water chestnuts in the mud fields. We were greedy to look at the surrounding scenery and worried about our feet. The gentle wind and the warm sun made us forget the time and the journey. Yang Xinquan started talking about his mutual aid team again. He said:
      "Last year, our entire team's rice averaged 700 jin per mu. We used salt water to select seeds. This year, we plan to grow two seasons of rice, and we should be able to harvest 1,000 jin per mu. That way, our entire country will harvest so much more. That number is impossible to calculate. That is truly increasing grain production for the country! This is also good for the farmers themselves!"
    He also answered other people's questions: "We are going to form a cooperative. The district has promised us. This time, the county summoned us to a meeting to discuss this matter. I must get it done this year. It wouldn't be right if I didn't take the lead. Others would talk, saying it's not important to me, but it's about the Communist Party!"
    Someone asked about his field acreage, calculated his harvest, and asked how much grain he sold to the cooperative. He also answered without thinking:
    "I harvested a lot last year. Our family of eight has seventeen mu of land, no dry land. We harvested 8,000 jin of rice, and some other miscellaneous grains. I paid off some debts and sold 1,500 jin of surplus grain to the cooperative." He showed a smile when he said this. He doesn't often laugh out loud, but he often has a slight smile. I always feel that this young man has a hidden strength, frank but not boastful.
    When we got very close to the ancestral hall, singing came from inside. We saw a young woman with a very cheerful appearance, wearing a floral calico shirt, hurriedly walk out of the ancestral hall, glance at us a few times, and quickly run into the side room. Yang Xinquan also led us into the side room. Two little girls ran out to greet us at the door. The older one shouted, "Big brother! Big brother! Where is the pen you bought for me?" The younger one muttered to herself a little shyly, "Candy fan, candy fan."

    Although this room is a side house, the courtyard seems a little narrow, but the house is not bad. As soon as we entered, we were in their middle hall. On the original paper strip with "Heaven, Earth, Country, Parent, Teacher" written on it, there was a picture of Chairman Mao pasted. The old marks of the paper strip were still visible. In the middle of the room was a low square table, surrounded by several small willow chairs. Yang Xinquan kept urging everyone to sit down. We, the group of people who came with him, were not polite, looking around. Someone walked into a room on the right and shouted, "Yang Xinquan, is this your new house? Everyone come and see, this house is so beautiful!"

    I followed in as well. The first thing I saw was a clothes rack. I hung my clothes on it and searched my memory; it seemed like it was the first time I had seen such a Western-style clothes rack in the countryside. I laughed too, "Haha, this was divided up during the land reform, right? Your landlords here were very Westernized." Then I saw a red-lacquered bed. I hadn't seen a red-lacquered bed for many years. I stepped onto the footstool of this bed and sat on the edge of the bed. Yang Xinquan's bed had an eight- or nine-year-old bed curtain hanging on it, brand-new bed sheets, and a bedspread made of Xiangxi printed fabric. The embroidered flowers on the head of the two pillows were a bit rough, and there was also a valance with the same embroidery. Although this bed was a bit old, most of the red lacquer was still very bright, the gold trim hadn't fallen off, and the carvings were also very delicate. This isn't the most elaborate Hunan eight-step bed, but it's definitely not something an ordinary family can have. I am very familiar with this kind of bed. When I was a child, I lived in my uncle's house, my aunt's house, my uncles' and uncles' houses, and I slept on beds like this. I am familiar with the owners of these beds, and even more familiar with the maids who wiped these beds, who often used a wet, thin strip of cloth to pull back and forth through the carvings of these beds. They didn't like these beautiful beds. My identity in those families should have been a guest, but the maids often treated me as a confidante. Now I'm back, back to the place where I lived when I was a child. Who is my dearest person? It's Yang Xinquan. He welcomes me. He was afraid that I wouldn't come to his house, so he said that the forty li lake was twenty li. He wanted to cook baba for me, cook winter amaranth for me, and stir-fry pickled vegetables for me. I also only want to come to their house. I want to see the life he lives, I want to understand his thoughts, I want to help him, as if we have had a very long and close relationship. I am now sitting on his bed, the red-lacquered bed, I am so excited. This bed should have been yours long ago. Your father worked as a farmhand his whole life, unable to support the whole family, teaching your mother and son to be beaten and scolded, and often begging. Now take these beds back from those people and let our own people sleep on them, this is how it should be. I thought back to when I was in North China, I walked into a small house, and an old woman was squatting on the earthen kang, crying. As soon as she saw me, she couldn't help but hug me and cry bitterly. I comforted her, and she shook the tattered quilt beside her, humming, "Look how can I mend this, I can't find a place to put a needle..." She must be doing very well now, but how long did she suffer! ...

    I didn't want others to see me cry, so I stood up and said to Yang Xinquan, "Where is your mother, where is your father? Where are the two old people? Take us to see them."

    We saw two women in the kitchen. One was the young woman in floral clothes that we saw outside the door, who Yang Xinquan married last fall. The other was Yang Xinquan's mother. His wife looked at us shyly and smiled honestly. The fire from the stove made her face even redder, and she had a Chinese language textbook in the pocket of her embroidered apron. We understood why she had just run out of the elementary school. She said she didn't know many characters, but the textbook was the fourth volume. She wasn't an elementary school student, she was auditing.

    I looked at Yang Xinquan's mother with respect, thinking about her lifelong hardships. Her rough skin and dry hands were marked by decades of wind and frost. Although her eyes still seemed very sharp, and her back still seemed very strong, not like a dying old person, she was the image of a working woman, but she was still an old woman. I was just about to say a few comforting words to her, expressing my sympathy for her. But she looked at me with scrutinizing eyes, and first asked about my age; when she found out that I was about the same age as her, she suddenly smiled and said to her daughter-in-law, "Look, she looks much older than me, I could tell at a glance." She immediately turned her face back and smiled to comfort me: "You are more worried than us. Work makes you tired. Alas, it's all for us! Now you've come to see us, don't worry, we're doing well." Yes, what she said was right. She is very young, her spirit is young. She doesn't need sympathy at all. She is still arranging her strength to build her more beautiful life. She has such small children, the two children at the door are both her little daughters. Decades of struggle haven't worn away her vitality. The new life and the prospect of life have given her great happiness and hope. Her husband is also very strong, and went to chop wood ten li away again today; her son is so capable, standing out in the local area, and doing things for everyone; she also has a daughter-in-law, and she now has a home, she will manage it well from the beginning and educate her children. She can't see, and doesn't pay attention to the wrinkles on her face and the yellow, sparse hair. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all because of her words. I saw a healthy, vibrant soul. I like this kind of person. I admire her energy. I said she is a young woman. I encouraged her to study and asked her to manage some of the village affairs.

    We went outside to play again and visited the school. This elementary school has five classrooms, ten or so classes, five teachers, and more than 200 students. This village, like other villages in Hunan, has a total of three elementary schools. It seems that there are very few school-age children who are out of school. When we went, the children had just finished class. Seeing this group of strangers, they followed behind in heaps, surrounded us in strings, with surprised and strange eyes, touching my companion's camera and asking:
    "Are you here to give us injections?" "Not giving injections? Then are you here to help with production?"
    "I know, you are here to inspect the work!"
    Yang Xinquan's little sister also joined us in playing. She had a small crooked braid tied, and sang nursery rhymes to us, those familiar nursery rhymes! I also sang these songs. So many years, and now I hear them again. I suddenly saw myself in her, saw my childhood. I also had this hairstyle, tied a crooked braid, and I also used this tone of voice to speak and sing nursery rhymes. It seems that I was also so silly and likable. But I saw a new destiny in her. She won't live like I did when I was a child. She won't walk the road I walked. She will happily walk the flat, productive road of her generation. I saw her golden future! I hugged her tightly, kissed her, and wanted her to call me mom. We took a close photo together.

    My companions also turned over some of Yang Xinquan's award certificates from the drawer. It turned out that he had participated in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. He was a company instructor there and was a labor model twice. When the work started, his labor force was classified as Grade B. From his height, we also felt that it could only be Grade B. But he did Grade A work in Grade B. Under his leadership, his team always completed tasks first. He also spoke very simply when talking about his leadership experience: "Bear hardships first, don't get angry, and help others solve difficulties." He added at the end, "I believe in the Communist Party. Everything I have is because the Chinese people have turned over. I want to do things for the people. I want to do everything in the best way." He joined the Party after returning from Jingjiang.

    We also read letters written to him by newspaper readers and Hunan Youth Daily, asking him about the amount of surplus grain he sold, asking him how he participated in the study of the general line and how he publicized it. The people not only encourage him, but also supervise him: "Yang Xinquan! Your life is getting better, you have become a cadre, but how will you go on, which path will you take?"

    Yang Xinquan said: "That's not right. We studied the general line last winter and went to the county for a ten-day meeting. From the meeting, we realized that the idea of getting rich is still very common. If there is no ideological education from the Party, if we go the wrong way again, we have made decades of movements and reformed others, but in the end we go to exploit others again. Look how stupid, how wronged! I sometimes think, how is Chairman Mao so wise, others say Chairman Mao is like the sun, the sun can only shine on what can be seen, but Chairman Mao sees what others can't see, he sees through all the people and things in the world, and he guides us step by step. I can't think like that, I can't go the wrong way. I must do a good job of forming a cooperative this year. The district will help me. Otherwise, I will be letting down 'him.' Everyone knows that I have seen 'him.'" He had that slight smile again.

    We also looked at his notes on studying the general line. We were very surprised that he remembered so well. Although his handwriting was not very skilled, it was very neat. He had only studied for one year in the past. This was entirely learned from working after liberation. How could such a small person have such great energy? In just over four years, he did so many things, learned so many things, and transformed a simple, uncultured, and oppressed young peasant into a party member and rural cadre who was full of vitality, understood many things, and was also able to handle various things. From him alone, I saw the change in the entire country, how amazing it is!
      We ate a very delicious meal. There was no chicken (they wanted to kill one, but we wouldn't allow it no matter what.) There was no meat (you can't buy it here.) There was only one cured fish; but the pickled vegetables, the fermented bean curd, and the green vegetables had such a local flavor; especially the baba, I still think it's the best.
    After the meal, we talked with him about the cooperative again. It was already four o'clock, and he had to go to the township government for a meeting. We calculated the journey and it was time to go back. He insisted on sending us to the riverside no matter what. So we walked back together. At this time, the sun shone on the mountain on the other side, making it clearer and closer. We saw clusters of white things, like clouds, floating on the mountain. What are those? Yang Xinquan said, "There, those are pear blossoms! Take a closer look, there are red clouds mixed in with the white, those are peach blossoms! We used to have so many here, it's really worthy of being called Peach Blossom Glade. But the peach blossoms here are beautiful, but the peaches are not good, they are all small hairy peaches, so they were all cut down and replaced with fields. Only those on the mountains and near the mountains are still left. Now you have seen the peach blossoms, right?"

    The small boat was still tied under the willow branches, and the boatman was sitting on the stern of the boat smoking a dry pipe.
    We only stayed here for a few hours, but we have endless reluctance. What else can we say besides encouraging this young man? Yang Xinquan also repeatedly urged us, hoping that we would come again. He said, "Comrade Ding! Others have already told me who you are. It was not easy for you to return to your hometown that you hadn't been back to for decades. I sincerely welcome you to come to my house and see our life. I was afraid that you wouldn't come, so I concealed the journey and deceived you. I also hope that you don't leave. Just live here with us and help us build socialism in Peach Blossom Glade."

    We finally left. This young man stood on the slope for a while, and then quickly disappeared. He is very busy, and there are many things that need him to do. He can do it. He is a new person! Although I have left and cannot stay in Peach Blossom Glade, I will help him, I will definitely help him.
    The sun was setting in the west, and I also fell into contemplation. The lake surface in the evening seemed even wider. Slowly the moon came out, what a peaceful lake! There was no sound around, a small red light was hanging on the fishing boat, and the boatman was rowing hard. I asked him softly, "Why are you in such a hurry?" I am very reluctant to leave this lake, very reluctant for this day to pass, and I really hope he can help me stay a little longer, to hold on to this intoxicating time!

    The boatman also softly agreed to me: "I still have to rush to the city to see a play, I didn't buy a ticket yesterday, someone has already bought one for me today, it's a good play, Qin Xianglian. It is very rare for us to see a play, it would be a pity to miss it. Let's hurry on our way, I think you are all very tired too."
    In this way, we all helped him paddle, and we quickly arrived at the embankment. We are not tired, we are very excited. We have many other things tomorrow, new impressions will be overwhelming, but we will never forget this day. Here there is not only the beautiful landscape of Hunan, not only the bright spring, not only because we saw bright and enthusiastic people, but also because everything is new! Everything fills me with joy, fills me with hope, and makes me unable to help but evoke many emotions. The world has changed like this, it has become so good! Although we can still find some old traces, they are so powerless; we have gained so much joy and increased so much strength in such a life, in such new people! How can I not record this trip? Even if it can only record a small part of my feelings. Peach Blossom Glade, Peach Blossom Glade, I am writing to you with unparalleled nostalgia and gratitude, and I am using writing about you to comfort my current restless mood.
                      March 10, 1954

    记游桃花坪
    丁玲
    天曚曚亮的时候，隔着玻璃窗户望不见一点红霞，天色灰暗，只有随风乱摆的柳丝，我的心就沉重起来了。南方的天气，老是没一个准，一会下雨，一会天晴，要是又下起雨来，我们去桃花坪的计划可就吹了。纵使去成了，也会减低很多兴趣的。不知道为什么，那种少年时代等着上那儿去玩的兴头、热忱和耽心，非常浓厚的笼罩着我。
    我们赶快起身，忙着张罗吃早饭。机关里很多见着我们的人，也表示耽心的说道：“今天的天气很难说咧。”好像他们都知道了我们要出门似的。真奇怪，谁问你们天气来着，反正，下雨我们也得去。不过，我们心里也的确同天色一样，有些灰，而且阴晴不定着咧。
    本来昨天约好了杨新泉，要他早晨七点钟来我们这里一道吃早饭，可是快八点了，我们老早把饭吃好了，还不见他来。他一定不来了，他一定以为天气不好，我们不会去，他就不来了，他一定已经各自走了，连通知我们一声也不通知，就回家去了。这些人真是！我一个人暗自在心里嘀咕，焦急的在大院子里的柳树林下徘徊。布谷鸟在远处使人不耐的叫唤着。
    忽然从那边树林下转出来两个人，谁呢，那走在后边的矮小个儿，不正是那个桃花坪的乡支部书记杨新泉么？这个人个子虽小走路却麻利，他几下就走到我面前，好像懂得我的心事一样，不等我问就说起来了。“丁同志，你没有等急吧。我交代了一点事才来，路不远，来得及。”他说完后不觉的也去看了看天，便又补充道：“今天不会下雨，说不定还会晴。”他说后便很自然的笑了。
    不知怎么搞的，我一下就相信了他，把原来的耽心都赶走了，我的心陡然明亮，觉得今天是个好天气。正像昨天一样：昨天下午我本来很疲乏了，什么也不想干，但杨新泉一走进来，几句话就把我的很索然的情绪变得很有兴致；我立刻答应他的邀请，他要请我吃粑粑，这还是三十年前我在家读书的时候吃过的，后来在外边也吃过很多样子的年糕，但总觉得不如小时吃的粑粑好。杨新泉他要请我吃粑粑，吃我从前吃过的粑粑，那是我多么向往着和等待着的啊！
    我们一群人坐汽车到七里桥。七里桥这地方，我小时候去过，是悄悄地和几个同学去看插秧的，听说插秧时农民都要唱秧歌，我们赶去看了，走得很累，满身大汗，采了许多野花，却没有听到唱歌。我记得离城不近，足足有七八里，可是昨天杨新泉却告诉我一出城就到。我当时想，也许他是对的，这多年来变化太大了，连我们小时住的那条街都没有了，七里桥就在城边是很可能的。可是我们还是走了好一会，才走到堤上，这堤当然是新的，是我没见过的，但这里离城还是有七八里路。我没有再问杨新泉。他呢，一到堤上就同很多人打招呼，他仿佛成了主人似的抢着张罗雇船去了。
    我们坐上一个小蓬蓬船。年老的船老板扬着头望着远处划开了桨，我们一下就到了河中心，风吹着水，起着一层层鱼鳞一样的皱纹，桨又划开了它。船在身子底下微微幌动，有一种生疏的却又亲切的感觉。
    我想着我小时候有一次也正是坐了一个这样的小蓬蓬船下乡去躲“反”，和亲戚家的姑娘们一道，好像也正是春天。我们不懂得大人们正在如何为时局发愁，我们一到船上就都高兴了起来，望着天，望着水，望着岸边上的小茅屋，望着青青的草滩，我们说不完的话，并且唱了起来。可是带着我们去的一个老太太可把我们骂够了，她不准我们站在船头上，不准我们说话，不准唱歌，要我们挤挤的坐在舱里。她说城里边有兵，乡下有哥弟会，说我们姑娘们简直不知道死活呢……。可是现在呢，我站在船头上，靠着蓬边，我极目望着水天交界的远处，风在我耳边吹过，我就像驾着云在水上飘浮。我隔着船篷再去望船老板，想找一点旧日的印象，却怎么也找不到。他好像对划船很有兴致，也好像是来游玩一样，也好像是第一次坐船一样，充满着一种自得其乐的神气。
    船转过了一个桥，人们正在眺望四周，小河却忽然不见了，一个大大的湖在我们面前，一会儿我们就置身在湖中了，两岸很宽，前面望不到边，这意外的情景使我们都惊喜了起来，想不到我们今天来这里游湖，可是也使我们耽忧今天的路程，那里会是杨新泉所说的只一二十里路呢。于是有人就问：“杨新泉，到你们家究竟有多远？”
    “不远。过湖就到。”
    “这湖有多少里？船老板？”
    “这湖么，有四十里吧。”
    “没有，没有，”杨新泉赶忙辩说着，“我们坐船哪一回也不过走两个多钟头。”
    “两个多钟头？你划吧，太阳当顶还到不了呢。”
    杨新泉不理他，转过脸来笑嘻嘻的说道：“丁同志，我包了，不会晚的，你看，太阳出来了，我说今天会晴的。”
    我心里明白了，一定是他说了一点小谎，可是他是诚恳的。这时还有人逼着问，到底桃花坪有多远。杨新泉最后只好说，不足四十里，只有三十七里，当他说有三十七里的时候，也并不解释，好像第一次说到这路程似的。只悄悄地望了一望我。
    他是一个很年青的人，二十三岁，身体并不显得结实，一看就知道是受过折磨的。他的右手因小时放牛，挨了东家的打，到现在还有些毛病，可是他很精干，充满了自信和愉快。你可以从他现在的精明处想像到他的多变的、挫折的幼年生活，但一点也找不到过去的悲苦。他当小乞丐，八岁就放牛，挨打，从这个老板家里转到那个老板家里，当小长工，他有父亲、母亲、弟弟、妹妹，他却没有过家，他们不是当长工，就是当乞丐。昨天他是多么的率直的告诉我道：“如今我真翻身翻透了，我什么都有啦，我翻身得真快啊！我的生活在村子里算不得头等，可是中间格格，你看，我年前做粑粑都做了不少米啦。”
    我告诉同去的几个人，他是到过北京，见过毛主席的。大家都对他鼓掌，便问他去北京的情形。他就详细的讲述他参观石景山钢铁厂，参观国营农场的感想。我问船老板知道这些事情不，他答道：“怎么会不知道？见毛主席那不是件容易事。杨新泉那时是民兵中队长，我们这一个专区，十来个县只选一个人去，去北京参加十月一号的检阅。毛主席还站在天安门上向他们喊民兵同志万岁。几十万人游行，好不热闹……”大家都听笑了，又问他，“你看见了么？”他也笑着答：“那还想不出来？我没有亲眼得见，我是亲耳听得的，杨新泉在我们乡做过报告，我们是一个乡的啦！”
    当杨新泉同别人说到热闹的时候，船老板又轻轻的对我说：他看着他长大的，小的时候光着屁股，拖着鼻涕，常常跟着他妈讨饭，替人家放牛，很能做事，也听话，受苦孩子嘛，不过看不出有什么出息。一解放，这孩子就参加了工作，当民兵，当农会主席，又去这里又去那里，一会儿代表，一会儿模范，真有点搞不清他了，嘿，变得可快，现在是能说能做；大家都听他，威信还不小呢。
    我看杨新泉时，他正在讲他怎样的参加减租退押工作，怎样搞土地改革。他的态度没有夸耀的地方，自自然然，平平常常。可是气势很壮，意思很明确、简切。
    太阳已经很高了，我们都觉得很热，可是这个柳叶湖却越走越长。杨新泉这时什么也不说，他跨到船头，脱去上身的小棉袄，就帮助划起桨来。他划得很好，我们立刻赶过了几只船，那些船上的人也认得他们，和他们打招呼，用热烈的眼光望着我们。
    还不到十二点，船就进了一个小叉港，停泊在一个坡坡边。这里倒垂着一排杨柳，柳丝上挂着绿叶，轻轻的拂在水面。我们急急的走到岸上，一眼望去，全是平坦坦的一望无际的水田，田里都灌满了水，映出在天空浮动的白云。一大片一大片的油菜地，浓浓的厚厚的铺着一层黄花，风吹过来一阵阵的甜香。另一些地里的紫云英也开了，淡紫色的，比油菜花显得柔和的地毡似的铺着，稍远处蜿蜒着一抹小山，在蓝天上温柔的、秀丽的画着一些可爱的线条。那上边密密的长满树林，显得翠生生的。千百条网似的田堰塍平铺了开去。在我们广阔的胸怀里，深深地呼吸到滋润了这黑泥土的大气，深深的感到这桃花坪的丰富的收成，和和平的我们的人的生活。我们都呆了，我们又清醒过来，我们不约而同的都问起来了：
      “你的家在那里？”
      “桃花坪，怎么没有看见桃花呀？”
    “你们这里的田真好啊！”
      杨新泉走在头里，指着远远地一面红旗飘扬的地方说道：“那就是我的家。我住的是杨家祠堂的横屋，祠堂里办了小学。那红旗就是学校的。”
    我们跟在他后边，在一些弯弯曲曲的窄得很不好走的堰塍上走着，泥田里有些人在挖荸荠，我们又贪看周围的景致，又耽心脚底下。温柔的风，暖融融的太阳，使我们忘却了时间和途程。杨新泉又在那里说起了他的互助组。他说：
      “咱们去年全组的稻谷平均每亩都收到七百斤。我们是采用了盐水选种。今年我们打算种两季稻，每亩地怎么样也能收一千斤。那样，我们整个国家要多收多少呀，那数目字可没法算，那就真是为国家增产粮食啊！这对于农民自己也好呀！”
    他又答复别人的问话：“要搞合作社呢，区上答应了我们，这次县上召集我们开会，就是为了这事。我今年一定要搞起来，我要不带头那还像话，别人就要说话啦，说我不要紧，是说共产党员呀！”
    有人又问他的田亩，又算他的收成，又问他卖了多少粮给合作社。他也是不假思索的答道：
    “我去年收了不少。我们全家八口人有十七亩来田，没有旱地，我们收了八千来斤谷子，还有一点别的杂粮。我还了一些账，把余粮卖给了合作社一千五百斤。”他说到这里又露出一丝笑容。他不大有发出声音的笑，却常常微微挂着一丝笑。我总觉得这年青人有那么一股子潜藏的劲，坦率而不浮夸。
    走到离祠堂很近时，歌声从里面传了出来，我们看见一个长得很开朗的，穿着花洋布衫的年轻的妇女匆匆忙忙从祠堂里走出来，望了我们几眼赶快就跑进侧面的屋子去了。杨新泉也把我们朝侧屋里让，门口两个小女孩迎面跑出来，大的嚷着：“大哥哥！大哥哥！你替我买的笔呢？”小的带点难为情的样子自言自语的念道：“扇子糖，扇子糖。”
    这屋子虽是横屋，天井显得窄一点，可是房子还不错。我们一进去就到了他们的中间堂屋，在原来“天地国亲师”的纸条子上，贴了一张毛主席像，纸条子的旧印子还看得见。屋中间一张矮四方桌子，周围有几把小柳木椅子，杨新泉一个劲儿让大家坐。我们这群同去的人都不会客气，东张西望的，有人走进右手边的一间屋子里去了，在那里就嚷道：“杨新泉，这是你的新房吧。大家来看，这屋子好漂亮啊！”
    我跟着也走了进去，第一眼我看见了一个挂衣架，我把衣朝上边一挂，脑子里搜索着我的印象；这样的西式衣架我好像还是第一次在农村里看见。我也笑起来了，“哈哈，这是土改分的吧，你们这里的地主很洋气呢。”于是我又看见了一张红漆床，这红漆床我可有很多年没有看见了，我走上这床的踏板，坐在那床沿上。杨新泉的床上挂了一幅八成新的帐子，崭崭新的被单，一床湘西印花布的被面。两个枕头档头绣得有些粗糙的花，还有一幅帐檐，上面也有同样的绣花。这床虽说有些旧了，可是大部分的红漆还很鲜明，描金也没有脱落，雕花板也很细致，这不是一张最讲究的湖南的八步大床，可也决不是一个普通人家能有的东西。这样的床同我很熟悉，小时候我住在我舅舅家，姨妈家，叔叔、伯伯家都是睡在这样的床上的。我熟悉这些床的主人们，我更熟悉那些拿着抹布擦这个床的丫头们，她们常常用一块打湿了的细长的布条在这些床的雕花板的眼里拉过去拉过来，她们不喜欢这些漂亮的床。我在那些家庭里的身份应该是客人，却常常被丫头们把我当着知心朋友。我现在回来了，回到小时候住过的地方，谁是我最亲爱的人？是杨新泉。他欢迎我，他怕我不来他家里把四十里湖说成二十里，他要煮粑粑给我吃，烧冬苋菜给我吃，炒腌菜给我吃。我也同样只愿意到他们家里来，我要看他过的日子，我要了解他的思想，我要帮助他，好像我们有过很长的很亲密的交情一样。我现在坐在他的床上，红漆床上，我是多么的激动。这床早就该是你们的。你的父亲做了一辈子长工，养不活全家，教你们母子挨打受骂，常常乞讨，现在把这些床从那些人手里拿回来，给我们自己人睡，这是多么应该的。我又回想到我在华北的时候，我走到一间小屋子去，那个土炕上蹲着一个老大娘正哭呢，她一看见我就更忍不住抱着我大哭，我安慰她，她抖着她身旁的一床烂被，哼着说：“你看我怎么能补呀，我找不到落针的地方……”她现在一定也很好了，可是多么长时间的酸苦呀！……
    我是不愿意让别人看见我流眼泪的，我站了起来向杨新泉道：“你的妈呢，你的爹呢，他们两位老人家在那里，你领我们去看他。”
    我们在厨房里看见了两个女人。一个就是刚才在门外看见的那个年青穿花衣裳的，是杨新泉去年秋天刚结婚的妻子。一个就是杨新泉他妈。他妻子腼腼腆腆的望着我们憨笑，灶火把她的脸照得更红，她的挑花围兜的口袋里插着国语课本。我们明了她为什么刚刚从小学校跑出来的原因了。她说她识字不多，但课本是第四册。她不是小学校学生，她是去旁听的。
    我用尊敬的眼光去打量杨新泉的妈，我想着她一生的艰苦的日子，她的粗糙的皮肤和枯干的手写上了她几十年的风霜，她的眼光虽说还显得很尖利，她的腰板虽说还显得很硬朗，不像风烛残年，是一个劳动妇女的形象，但总是一个老妇人了，我正想同她温存几句，表示我对她的同情。可是她却用审查的眼光看了一看我，先问起我的年龄；当她知道了我同她差不多大小，她忽然笑了，向她媳妇说道：“你看，她显得比我大多了吧，我一眼就看出来了。”她马上又反过脸来笑着安慰我：“你们比我们操心，工作把你们累的，唉，全是为了我们啊！现在你来看我们来了，放心吧，我们过得好咧。”是的，她的话是对的。她很年青，她的精神是年青的，她一点也不需要同情，她还在安排着力量建设她的更美满的生活，她有那样小的孩子，门口那两个孩子都是她的小女儿。几十年的挣扎没有消磨掉她的生命力。新的生活，和生活的远景给了她很大幸福和希望。她的丈夫也很强壮，今天又去十里以外的地方打柴去了；儿子是这样的能干，在地方上出头露面，给大家办事；她又有了媳妇，她现在才有家，她要从头好好管理它，教育子女。她看不见，也没有理会她脸上的皱纹，和黄的稀疏的头发。我一点也没有因为她的话有什么难受，我看见了一个健康的、充满活力的灵魂。我喜欢这样的人，我赞美她的精力，我说她是一个年青的妇女，我鼓励她读书，要她管些村子上的事。
    我们又到外边去玩，又去参观学校，这个小学校有五个教室，十来个班次，有五个教员，二百多学生。这个乡也同湖南其他的乡一样，一共有三个小学校。看来学龄儿童失学的情形是极少有的了。我们去时，孩子们刚下课，看见这一群陌生人，便一堆堆的跟在后面，一串串的围上来，带着惊喜和诧异的眼光，摸着我的同伴的照相机纷纷问道：
    “你们是来跟我们打针的？”“不是打针的？那你们是来帮助生产的？”
    “我知道，你们是来检查工作的！”
    杨新泉那个小妹妹也挤在我们一起来玩了，她扎了一根小歪辫子，向我们唱儿歌，那些多么熟悉的儿歌呵！这些歌我也唱过的，多少年了，现在我又听到。我忽然在她的身上看见了我自己，看见了我的童稚的时代，我也留过这样的头，扎个歪辫子，我也用过这样的声调讲话和唱儿歌，我好像我也曾这样憨气，和逗人喜欢。可是我在她身上却看见了新的命运，她不会像我小时的那样生活，她不会走我走过的路，她会很幸福的走着她这一代的平坦的有造就的大路，我看见她的金黄色的未来！我紧紧地抱着她，亲她，我要她叫我妈妈，我们亲密的照了一个像。
    我的同伴们又把杨新泉的一些奖状从抽屉里翻出来了。原来他曾参加过荆江分洪的工程，他在那里当中队指导员，当过两次劳动模范。工作开始的时候，他的劳动力是编在乙等的，我们从他的个子看也觉得只能是乙等。可是他在乙等却做甲等的工作。他的队在他的领导下也总是最先完成任务。他讲他的领导经验时也很简单：“吃苦在前，不发脾气，帮助别人解决困难”。他最后又加添说：“我相信共产党，我的一切是中国人民翻了身才有的，我要替人民做事。我要把一切事情都做得最好。”从荆江回来他就参加了党。
    我们也读到报纸读者和湖南青年报写给他的信，问他卖余粮的数目，问他如何参加总路线的学习和怎样宣传的。人民不只鼓励着他，而且监督着他：“杨新泉！你的生活过好了，你当了干部，可是你怎样走下去，你走那条路呢？”
    杨新泉说：“那不行呢，我们去年冬天学习了总路线，到县上开了十天会，从会议上才懂得，发财的思想还是很普遍呢。要是没有党的思想教育，要是我们又走错了路，我们闹了几十年运动，改革别人，结果自己又去剥削别人，你看多蠢，多冤枉！我有时想，毛主席怎么那末神明，别人都说毛主席像太阳，太阳只能照得见看得见的东西，毛主席却看见旁人看不见的东西，他把全世界的人和事情都看透了，他就这样一步一步的引导着我们。我不能那样想，我不能走错路呢。我今年一定要好好搞合作社，区上会帮助我的。要不然我对不起‘他’，谁都知道我是见过‘他’的。”他又那样微微挂着
  一丝笑。
    我们又看了他学习总路线的笔记。我们很奇怪他记得那末好，他写字虽说不很熟练，却很整齐。他过去只读过一年书，这完全是解放后工作中学习得来的。他那样一个小小个子，怎么能有这样大的精力，仅仅只在四年多中间，做了那么多的事，学了那么多的东西，把一个简单的没有文化受压迫的青年农民，一下变成这样一个充满了活力，懂得很多事，也能担待各种事的党员和农村干部了。我从他一个人的身上看到整个国家的改变，真是多么的惊人呵！
      我们吃了一顿非常好吃的饭，没有鸡，（他们要杀的，我们怎样也不准他杀。）没有肉，（这里买不到）只有一条腊鱼；可是那腌菜，那豆腐乳，那青菜是多么的带着家乡风味；特别是粑粑，我还是觉得那是最好吃的。
    饭后我们又和他谈了一些关于合作社的问题。已经四点钟了，他还要去乡政府开会，我们计算路程，也该回去了。他怎么样也要送我们到河边。我们便又一道走了回来。这时太阳照到那边山上，显得清楚多了，也觉得更近了一些，我们看见一团团的，云彩一样的白色的东西浮在山上。那是什么呢？杨新泉说：“那里末，那是李花呀！你们再仔细看看，那白色的里面就夹着红色的云，那就是桃花呀！以前我们这里真多，真不枉叫桃花坪。不过我们这里桃花好看，桃子不好，尽是小毛桃，就都砍了，改种了田，只有那山上和靠山边的地方就还留得不少。现在你们看见了桃花了吧。”
    小船还系在柳丝下，船老板一个人坐在船艄上抽旱烟。
    我们只在这里呆了几个钟头，却有无限的留恋，我们除了勉励这青年人还有什么话说呢？杨新泉也殷殷的叮嘱我们，希望我们再来。他说：“丁同志！别人已经告诉我你是谁了，你好容易才回到几十年也没有回来过的家乡，我从心里欢迎你来我家里，看看我们的生活，我怕你不来，就隐瞒了路程，欺骗了你。我还希望你不走呢，你就住在我们这里吧，帮助我们桃花坪建设社会主义吧。”
    我们终于走了。这青年人在坡上立了一会，一转身很快就不见了。他是很忙的，需要他做的事可多呢。他能做的。他是新的人！我虽说走了，不能留在桃花坪，可是我会帮助他的，我一定会帮助他的。
    太阳在向西方落去，我也落在沉思中，傍晚的湖面显得更宽阔。慢慢月亮出来了，多么宁静的湖呵！四周围一点声音都没有，渔船上挂着一盏小小的红灯，船老板一个劲的划着。我轻轻的问他：“你急什么呢？”我是很舍不得这湖呵很舍不得这一天要过去，很希望他能帮助我多留一会儿，留住这多么醉人的时间！
    船老板也轻轻的答应我：“我还要赶到城里去看戏呢，昨天我没有买到票，今天已经有人替我买了，是好戏，秦香莲呢。我们很难得看戏，错过了很可惜。我们还是赶路吧，我看你们也都很累了。”
    这样，我们就都帮助他荡桨，我们很快就到了堤边。我们并不累，我们很兴奋，我们明天有很多别的事，新的印象又要压过来，但我们永远也忘不了这一天。这里不只是有了湖南秀丽的山水，不只是有了明媚的春光，不只是因为看见了明朗热情的人，而且因为一切都是新的呵！一切都使我充满了欣喜，充满了希望，使我不得不引起许多感情。世界就是这样变了，变得这样的好！虽说我们还能找出一些旧的踪影来，可是那是多么的无力；我们就在这样的生活之中，就在这样的新的人物之中，获得了多少的愉快，和增加了多少力量啊！我怎么能不把这一次的游玩记下来呢，那怕它只能记下我的感情的很少一部分。桃花坪，桃花坪呀，我是带着无比的怀恋和感谢的激情来写到你，并且拿写你来安慰我现在的不能平静的心情。
                      一九五四年三月十日
