    The Old Revolutionary Base Construction Committee of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, held a plenary meeting of all members on April 12. The meeting summarized and reviewed the construction work of the old revolutionary base last year, and made preliminary studies on the guiding principles and tasks of this year's construction work. It was determined to continue to implement the principle of relying mainly on the strength of the masses and supplementing with government subsidies, to further support the people in the old revolutionary base to carry out production and construction recovery work. This year, the People's Government allocated another 265 million yuan as construction funds. Among them, 70 percent will be used to restore and develop agricultural production and camellia oleifera forests, and 30 percent will be used to solve the food and housing difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the poorest farmers. It was also decided to focus on the construction of eight townships, including Heping and Fuxing.

    The work of restoring and constructing the old revolutionary base in Pingjiang County has achieved great success. Last year, the People's Government allocated more than 1.7 billion yuan to help the people in the old revolutionary base solve their production and living difficulties, and focused on the construction of nine townships, so that the number of cattle in these nine townships increased by more than two times compared with before liberation, agricultural tools increased by 62 percent, houses increased by more than 37 percent, and newly added clothing and bedding increased by 22 percent. Li Deliang, a martyr's family member in Jinmei Township, used to have only two dilapidated thatched huts for his seven family members. Now, he not only has been allocated land, but also has built three new houses, with all kinds of agricultural tools and furniture. The old revolutionary base in the county is extremely rich in forest resources, but it is extremely difficult to transport them out due to the blockage of rivers. Last year, the Lutou River was dredged, so that more than 450,000 pine and fir trees on both sides of the Lutou River were successfully transported out. The special products of the old revolutionary base, such as camellia oil, tea, and ramie, have been rapidly restored in recent years. The tea oil production in Shangenxi Township was only 55 dan in 1950, but it reached 380 dan last year. In another four years, all the barren tea hills can be reclaimed. Last year, the farmers in Huangjindong reclaimed more than 5,400 mu of tea gardens.

      The cultural, educational, and health work of the people in the old revolutionary base has also made great progress. Last year, ten new schools were built, twenty-five schools were renovated, and forty-three mobile schools were established. More than 22,000 children and young people enrolled in schools, and more than 300 adults attended night schools. The mobile schools solved the difficulty of nearly 400 children and adults who could not attend school for a long time. In terms of health, three mobile medical teams were established in the old revolutionary base, which carried out 51 rounds of treatments, treated more than 2,500 patients, and gave preventive injections to more than 4,100 people. More than 27,600 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the county received free medical treatment, exempting them from more than 320 million yuan in medical expenses. (Pi Zhichu)

    湖南省平江县老根据地人民生活不断提高
    湖南省平江县老根据地建设委员会，于四月十二日召开了全体委员会议。总结检查了去年老根据地建设工作，对今年建设工作的方针任务也作了初步研究。确定继续贯彻组织群众力量为主、政府补助为辅的方针，进一步扶助老根据地人民进行生产建设恢复工作。今年人民政府又拨了二亿六千五百万元作为建设经费。其中百分之七十用以恢复和发展农业生产和油茶林，百分之三十用以解决烈军属和最贫苦农民的口粮和住房困难。并确定以和平、复兴等八个乡为重点建设乡。
    平江县恢复和建设老根据地工作已获得很大成绩。去年人民政府拨了十七亿多万元帮助老根据地人民解决了生产、生活上的困难，并重点建设了九个乡，使这九个乡的耕牛比解放前增加了两倍多，农具增加了百分之六十二，房子增加了百分之三十七以上，新添衣被百分之二十二。金梅乡烈属李德良过去七口人只有两间破烂茅草棚，现在不仅分得土地，还新盖了三间房子，农具家具样样齐备。该县老根据地的林木极为丰富，但因河道阻塞，运出极感困难。去年开挖了芦头河，使芦头河两岸四十五万多根松杉林木顺利运出。老根据地的油茶、茶叶、竹麻等特产，几年来都很快地得到恢复，上恩溪乡茶油一九五○年只产五十五担，去年就产了三百八十担，再过四年即可将荒芜的茶山全部垦复。黄金洞的农民去年一年即垦复了五千四百多亩茶园。
      老根据地人民的文教、卫生工作也有很大发展。去年新建了十个学校，修整了二十五个学校，成立了四十三处巡回学校，有二万二千多个儿童、青年入了学，三百多成年人上了夜校，巡回学校解决了近四百个儿童和成年人长期不能就学的困难。在卫生方面，老根据地成立了三个巡回医疗队，先后轮回治疗五十一次，医治好了二千五百多病人，有四千一百多人打了防预针，全县有二万七千六百多烈军属得到免费医治，免去医药费共三亿二千多万元。（皮质初）
