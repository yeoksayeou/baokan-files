The CCP Hubei Xiaogan Prefectural Committee convened the second local industry conference of the entire special district from March 26th to April 3rd. The conference first summarized the work of local industries in the entire district in 1953. In the past year, local industries, after rectification, implemented the production and operation policies for local industries, carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and conducted studies of the general line. All of these have achieved great results. Local industries in the entire district overfulfilled the annual production plan. Subsequently, the conference focused on conducting serious analysis and criticism of tendencies of detachment from the general line. The conference pointed out: Some factories have capitalist management ideas. For example, after each oil pressing factory was changed to cooperative processing on behalf of the cooperative, in order to earn more processing fees, the output generally increased, but the oil extraction rate generally decreased, wasting oil and causing losses to the country. The output of rice processing factories also generally increased, but the purity of the rice was neglected, and the amount of millet, barnyard grass, and sand in the rice also increased compared to before. Secondly, due to an unclear understanding of the position and role of local state-owned industries in the national industrialization cause, a few cadres still have the idea of not being content with their work, and there are also phenomena of disunity among leading cadres. Thirdly, because some cadres have an unclear understanding of relying on workers to do a good job in production, they neglect safe production, so production accidents continue to occur. According to incomplete statistics, in 1953, the losses caused to the country by accidents in the entire special district were greater than the planned profits for 1954. In addition, there are still chaotic phenomena in the financial system. For example, the Qunyi Brick and Tile Factory in Hanyang County, without the approval of higher authorities, arbitrarily built a dormitory building. In response to these erroneous tendencies, through analysis and criticism, the cadres participating in the meeting realized that the nature of these problems all violated the spirit of the general line; if they are not overcome, they will cause great losses to the cause of national industrialization. After discussion, the cadres' thinking was greatly improved. (Chen Fan)

    中共湖北省孝感地委召开地方工业会议
    批判生产经营中脱离总路线的倾向
    中共湖北省孝感地委于三月二十六日到四月三日召开了全专区第二届地方工业会议。会议首先总结了一九五三年全区地方工业的工作。在去年一年中，地方工业经过整顿，贯彻了地方工业生产和经营方针，开展了增产节约运动，进行了总路线的学习。这些都获得了很大的成绩。全区地方工业超额完成了全年生产计划。接着，会议着重对脱离总路线的倾向进行了认真的分析和批判。会议指出：有些工厂存在着资本主义经营思想，如各榨油厂自改为代合作社加工后，为了多拿加工费，产量普遍提高了，可是出油率却普遍降低，浪费了油料，给国家造成了损失。加工米厂的产量也普遍提高，但忽视了米的纯度，米中的谷子、稗子、砂子也较前增多。其次，由于对地方国营工业在国家工业化事业中的地位和作用认识不清，少数干部还有不安心工作的思想，在领导干部中还有不团结的现象。第三，由于有些干部对依靠职工搞好生产的认识不明确，忽视安全生产，因此生产中的事故不断发生。据不完全的统计，全专区在一九五三年中，由于事故给国家造成的损失，比一九五四年的计划利润还要大。此外，在财务制度上还存在着混乱现象，如汉阳县群益砖瓦厂未经上级批准，擅自修盖宿舍楼房一座。针对这些错误倾向，经过分析和批判，使参加会议的干部认识到这些问题的性质都是违背总路线的精神的；如不加以克服，将给国家工业化的事业造成很大的损失。经过讨论，干部思想大大提高了一步。　（陈　帆）
