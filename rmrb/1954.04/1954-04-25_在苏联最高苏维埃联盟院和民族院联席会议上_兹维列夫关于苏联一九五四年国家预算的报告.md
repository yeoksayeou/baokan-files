    At the Joint Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Nationalities
    Zverev's Report on the 1954 National Budget of the Soviet Union

    Comrade Deputies! The draft of the 1954 national budget of the Soviet Union submitted by the Soviet government to the Supreme Soviet for review reflects the further development of various sectors of the national economy, guarantees the necessary funds to develop heavy industry, realize the measures formulated by the Party and the government to boost agriculture and further improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and ensure the further strengthening of national defense.

    The draft budget stipulates the allocation of large amounts of funds to heavy industry, because heavy industry has always been the foundation of the foundation for developing all sectors of the socialist national economy and strengthening our national defense, and the foundation for the happy life of the Soviet people. Due to the victorious execution and over-fulfillment of the tasks stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, our heavy industry achieved new and great achievements in 1953. The total output value of the means of production industry increased by 12 percent compared with 1952. In 1953, the production plans for the extraction of oil, iron ore, and manganese ore, as well as the production plans for aluminum, electricity, machine tools, heavy-duty trucks and small cars, boilers, diesel engines, ironmaking and steelmaking equipment, and other means of production necessary for the development of various sectors of the national economy, were all over-fulfilled. Last year, our machinery manufacturing industry produced many new and new types of machines and machinery, which were sufficient to guarantee the further technical development of the national economy. Many new types of power, electrical, oil extraction, coal mining, and metallurgical equipment, as well as various equipment for mechanizing laborious operations in coal mines, mining enterprises, and construction projects, have been manufactured. Many new types of highly efficient light industrial and food industrial equipment, as well as new types of agricultural machinery, have been manufactured. The investment in ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting, power stations, coal mining industry, oil industry, chemical industry, machinery manufacturing industry, as well as wood and paper industry, construction industry, and building materials industry has been greatly increased. In 1953, the investment in these industrial sectors was over 80 billion rubles. The investment in further developing transportation sectors such as railway transportation, sea and inland river transportation, automobile transportation, and postal and telecommunications, and the investment in building highways amounted to about 18 billion rubles.

    On the basis of the achievements already made in the development of heavy industry in the past, the Party and government's decision to vigorously expand the production of consumer goods and develop agriculture began to be implemented in 1953, which is reflected in the implementation of the national budget.

    In addition to implementing huge construction plans in the heavy industry sector, the construction of enterprises producing food and daily necessities is also being widely carried out. The investment in this construction in the second half of 1953 was almost one and a half times that of the first half. About 300 new enterprises producing consumer goods were put into production during the year. The consumer goods industry developed at a faster rate in 1953; its product output increased by 9 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 1952, and by 14 percent in the second half of the year compared with the same period in 1952. The consumer goods production plan for 1953 was over-fulfilled.

    In terms of measures for developing agriculture, a total of 52.3 billion rubles were spent last year from the budget and other state funds, of which basic investment accounted for about 12 billion rubles, which was used to prepare tractors, combine harvesters, automobiles, various agricultural machinery and farm implements, and to build machine tractor stations. The most important condition for improving agriculture is the ongoing economic improvement of collective farms and collective farmers' interests in developing and strengthening public agricultural production. For this purpose, the prices of livestock products, potatoes, and vegetables that collective farms and collective farmers are obligated to sell to the state were increased last year; the quantity of grain, meat, milk, potatoes, and vegetables purchased by the state at higher prices was increased. All of this has led to a certain increase in the income of collective farms and collective farmers. In 1953, the cash income of collective farms and collective farmers from the obligatory sales and sales of agricultural products to the state increased by almost 45 percent compared with 1952. The additional expenditure from the budget due to the increase in the procurement and purchase prices of agricultural products in 1953 was about 9 billion rubles. According to the decision of the last session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, the agricultural tax on the individual management production of collective farmers and other citizens was greatly reduced last year. Due to the reduction of agricultural tax and many other tax benefits, collective farmers and other residents engaged in agriculture received benefits worth about 5 billion rubles.

    Retail trade volume increased significantly in 1953. The government took measures to increase the total amount of commodities. The total sales of consumer goods in 1953, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 21 percent compared with 1952; the commodities sold by consumer cooperatives in rural areas increased by 24 percent compared with 1952. The reduction of retail prices of consumer goods implemented last year was one of the largest price reductions implemented in recent years. Last year, residents received benefits worth more than 50 billion rubles from this price reduction.

    The national income of the Soviet Union in 1953 increased by 8 percent compared with 1952, which made it possible to improve the people's consumption level. The total income of workers, staff, and peasants in 1953 increased by 13 percent compared with 1952, calculated at comparable prices.

    In the 1953 budget, the allocation for social and cultural facilities was 128.8 billion rubles. In 1953, the Soviet people received a total of 195 billion rubles from the state budget (including the reduction of retail prices and other expenditures to improve the material welfare of the working people), while it was 147 billion rubles in 1952.

    At the same time, in 1953, the funds provided to the budget by the working people from their personal income in the form of paying taxes and subscribing to public bonds amounted to 65 billion rubles, which was 21 billion rubles less than in 1952. Therefore, in 1953, workers, collective farmers, and staff received 130 billion rubles more from the budget than they paid into the budget from their personal income, while it was 61 billion rubles more in 1952.

    On the basis of the growth of socialist production and national income, the state's finances have been further consolidated. According to preliminary statistics, the implementation of the 1953 Soviet national budget is as follows: revenue of 539.7 billion rubles, expenditure of 514.8 billion rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 24.9 billion rubles. As in previous years, this makes it possible to increase credit investment in the national economy and further strengthen our Soviet currency.

    Soviet Union's 1954 National Budget

    Comrade Deputies! Now submit the Soviet Union's 1954 national budget to the Supreme Soviet for approval. The budget revenue is 571.8 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 562.7 billion rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by 9.1 billion rubles. The budget reflects the policy of peaceful economic and cultural construction pursued by our Party and government, the policy of further developing heavy industry and, on this basis, comprehensively developing agriculture and greatly increasing the production of consumer goods.

    The vast majority of the state budget funds are used to develop industry, agriculture, transportation, trade, and other sectors of the national economy, and to improve the material and cultural welfare of the Soviet people.

    Use of Budget Funds

    In 1954, the funds used for the national economy are 326.7 billion rubles, of which 216.3 billion rubles are allocated from the state budget, and 110.4 billion rubles are allocated from the funds of various economic organizations. The state's expenditure in the national economy is 19.8 percent more than the preliminary summary of 1953. It is planned to allocate 184.9 billion rubles for basic investment and to increase the circulating funds of the national economy, of which 121.1 billion rubles are allocated from the budget. The huge amount of basic investment makes it possible to greatly increase the fixed assets of industry, agriculture, transportation, and other sectors of the national economy in 1954, build many new factories, power stations, mines, and expand the construction of housing, cultural, and social welfare facilities.

    The national economic development plan and the draft budget stipulate that heavy industry should be further developed, because it plays a decisive role in ensuring the expanded reproduction of the means of production and ensuring the rapid improvement of agriculture and light industry. The basic investment in ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting, power stations, coal mining industry, oil industry, chemical industry, machinery manufacturing industry, wood and paper industry, construction industry, and building materials industry has been greatly increased. In 1954, the basic investment in these industrial sectors is over 90 billion rubles, which is almost 10 billion rubles more than last year. In 1954, it is necessary to ensure the further increase in the production of milled iron, steel, and steel products, the amount of coal and oil extraction, the amount of power generation, the output of equipment, and the output of various other products of heavy industry.

    More than 14 billion rubles are allocated for the construction of food industrial enterprises and daily necessities industrial enterprises, while it was 7.6 billion rubles in 1953. This year, the output of consumer goods will reach the level of 1955 stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. This means that the Five-Year Plan for consumer goods production will be completed in advance within four years.

    In 1954, huge amounts of funds were allocated to implement measures for developing agriculture. The state allocated 74.4 billion rubles from the budget and other sources to develop agriculture, which is 42.4 percent more than in 1953. In 1954, it is stipulated that the basic investment in agriculture is 21 billion rubles, which is about 80 percent more than in 1953. In order to implement the provisions of the Party and government's decision on developing agriculture to increase procurement and purchase prices and reduce taxes, 47 billion rubles more will be spent in 1954 than in 1952. Among the budget allocations for developing agriculture, the allocation for further strengthening machine tractor stations occupies a significant position. This year, 30.8 billion rubles will be allocated in this regard, which is 10.2 billion rubles more than in 1953. A large amount of funds has been allocated for the development of state-owned farms. The funds used for reclaiming virgin and fallow land are fully guaranteed. Due to the increase in procurement and purchase prices of agricultural products and the increase in the state's purchase volume in 1953, 23.3 billion rubles will be spent in the 1954 budget, which will further increase the economic benefits of collective farms and collective farmers in developing the public economy. The peasant taxation system, which was revised according to the resolution of the Fifth Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, has already had a positive impact on the development of collective farmers' private livestock industry and will enable better use of homestead plots. Due to the reduction of tax amounts, the taxes paid by collective farmers and other residents engaged in agriculture in 1954 will be reduced by 8.2 billion rubles compared with 1952.

    In 1954, the task of commodity circulation stipulated in the Five-Year Plan should be completed ahead of schedule. Calculated at comparable prices, the amount of commodity circulation in 1954 will increase by 75 percent compared with 1950, while the task stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan for 1955 is only to increase by 70 percent compared with 1950. The recent re-reduction of state retail prices of food and manufactured goods will enable residents to receive at least another 20 billion rubles in benefits throughout the year. The necessary funds for this aspect have also been allocated in this year's budget. In the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1954), the state retail prices of consumer goods have been reduced by more than 25 percent compared with the level of 1950. The prices of food and industrial products purchased by Soviet residents are now 56.5 percent lower than the prices in 1947. The budget also stipulates further increasing the working capital of trade agencies in order to expand the variety of commodities.

    Due to the increase in production and the expansion of commodity circulation, the national economic development plan for 1954 stipulates that the cargo turnover of various transportation sectors should also be expanded. The funds used to develop various transportation sectors in 1954 amount to 38.8 billion rubles, of which 21.4 billion rubles are allocated from the budget, and the basic investment in this aspect accounts for 18.6 billion rubles, which is more than 5 percent more than in 1953.

    Comrade Deputies! Constantly improving the material living standards and developing socialist culture of our people has always been the tireless concern of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. This year, the funds for social and cultural facilities are stipulated to be 141.3 billion rubles, which is almost 10 percent more than the preliminary summary of last year's budget implementation. The funds used for universal education, training of cadres, development of science and art, and other cultural and educational undertakings are 67.1 billion rubles, the funds used for public health and sports are 29.3 billion rubles, and the funds used for social insurance, pensions, and subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers are 44.9 billion rubles.

    In 1954, the number of students in primary schools, secondary schools, technical secondary schools, and universities will increase. This year, the number of students graduating from secondary schools will increase to about twice that of 1953, which proves that significant achievements will be made in realizing the task of developing universal secondary education stipulated by the 19th Party Congress. In 1954, universities and technical secondary schools will enroll more than one million people.

    A large amount of funds has been allocated for the development of Soviet science. In 1954, more than 9.5 billion rubles have been allocated from the budget and other sources to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Academies of Sciences of various union republics, and scientific research institutes.

    The 1954 budget increases the allocation for hospitals, joint clinics, clinics, maternity hospitals, nurseries, and other health institutions; the number of sanatoriums will increase. The funds for social and insurance aspects in the 1954 national budget are stipulated to be 24.7 billion rubles, which is 6.7 percent more than last year. This part of the funds will be used to pay subsidies for temporary loss of labor, pensions, recuperation and treatment expenses in sanatoriums, and other needs of workers and staff.

    The government stipulates that a broad plan for housing construction should be implemented in 1954; the funds used for state housing construction are 25.5 billion rubles, which greatly exceeds the expenditure in this aspect last year. Due to the increase in the state's expenditure on social and cultural facilities, the re-reduction of state retail prices of consumer goods, the increase in procurement and purchase prices of agricultural products, and many other measures, the residents of the Soviet Union will receive about 45 billion rubles more in benefits from the budget in 1954 than in 1953.

    While implementing a broad plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction, the Soviet state also constantly cares about its national defense. The expenditure for national defense in the 1954 budget is stipulated to be 100.3 billion rubles, which is 17.8 percent of the total budget expenditure. This amount of expenditure stipulated in the Soviet national budget guarantees the necessary defense capabilities and guarantees the improvement of the Soviet armed forces, which defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the security of our motherland.

    The starting point of the Soviet state's peace policy is that developing economic relations with countries that are willing to develop economic relations is a major factor in strengthening international cooperation. The Soviet Union unswervingly expands trade ties with other countries, while the ruling groups of imperialist countries, especially the ruling groups of the United States, do everything possible to obstruct the development of trade with the Soviet Union. This policy of imperialist countries first harms the economies of these countries themselves, reduces the employment rate of residents of these countries and their living standards. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union's policy of consolidating peace and expanding foreign affairs and economic relations has gained enthusiastic support among the broad masses of people in those countries that are extremely concerned about maintaining peace and easing international tensions.

    Budget Revenue

    The budget revenue funds can fully guarantee the expenditure stipulated in the draft budget. In the 1954 national budget of the Soviet Union, as in the 1953 national budget, the income from socialist enterprises has greatly increased, while at the same time the amount of taxes on residents has been further reduced.

    In the total amount of 571.8 billion rubles of revenue in the 1954 Soviet national budget, the income from the socialist economy accounts for 497 billion rubles, which accounts for 86.9 percent of the total budget revenue. The income from socialist enterprises and institutions in the budget is formulated based on the approved national economic production plan and the plan to reduce product costs. Among them, the income from turnover tax is 234.3 billion rubles, and the profit retention from various enterprises and institutions is 92.6 billion rubles. The necessary conditions for guaranteeing budget revenue are that each enterprise completes the stipulated product production plan and the plan to reduce costs, strictly abides by financial discipline, and practices economy in all positions of economic and financial work. The state budget stipulates that the total amount of taxes paid by residents in 1954 is 45.7 billion rubles, which accounts for 8 percent of the budget revenue. The income from agricultural tax is estimated to be 4.2 billion rubles. The standard for farmers' taxes in 1954 has been reduced by three-fifths compared with 1952.

    The 1954 budget stipulates that the total amount of public bonds purchased by residents is 15.9 billion rubles. This year, the state budget allocates 10.5 billion rubles for the prizes and repayment of principal of public bonds. One of the signs of the growth of the welfare of our residents is the large increase in labor savings. It is expected that the amount of residents' savings will increase by 9.5 billion rubles in 1954, and the total amount of savings at the end of this year will reach 48 billion rubles.

    Budgets of Various Union Republics

    In 1954, the total amount of the national budgets of various union republics (including the budgets of union republics and local budgets) is 119.5 billion rubles, which is 13.7 billion rubles more than in 1953. The reason why the budgets of various union republics have greatly increased in 1954 is directly related to the extremely important tasks faced by the councils of ministers of these republics and the executive committees of the local labor people's congresses, which are to further develop various sectors of the republic's national economy - industry, agriculture, housing-public utility construction, road construction, ensure the rapid increase in the production of consumer goods and the great upsurge in cultural construction. The allocation from the republic budget to republic enterprises and local enterprises is 35.5 billion rubles, and if the funds of the enterprises themselves are included, it is 56.9 billion rubles, which is 56.6 percent more than in 1953. This year, the basic investment in developing local industry and fuel industry has increased by 45 percent compared with 1953. A large amount of funds in the republic budgets and local budgets are used for social and cultural facilities. In 1954, 73.2 billion rubles have been allocated for these purposes, of which education expenses account for 41.4 billion rubles, and public health and sports expenses account for 22.7 billion rubles. The budget amounts of various union republics in 1954 are as follows:

    Name of Union Republic　Budget Amount (in millions of rubles)
    Russian Federation　66570
    Ukraine　22988
    Belarus　4289
    Uzbekistan　3738
    Kazakhstan　5313
    Georgia　2775
    Azerbaijan　2057
    Lithuania　1741
    Moldova　1406
    Latvia　1654
    Kyrgyzstan　1250
    Tajikistan　1272
    Armenia　1221
    Turkmenistan　1075
    Estonia　1179
    Karelia-Finland　950

    The revenue stipulated in the budgets of various union republics must be collected on schedule, and the budget expenditure should be used correctly and effectively. However, the institutions of individual union republics and local institutions are not resolute enough in using the resources stipulated in the budget and violate the regulations for using funds. It must be pointed out here that the budgets of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Turkmen Republic have not been completed in the past two years. The budgets of the Vladimir Oblast and the Novosibirsk Oblast were not completed in 1953 either. The supervision of the implementation of production and financial plans by the economic institutions of the republic and local levels is still insufficient. Therefore, many enterprises and economic organizations in the Karelia-Finland Republic, the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, and the Voronezh Oblast did not complete the plan for earning profits and handing over profits in 1953, and there was a shortage of circulating funds. The executive committees of the labor people's congresses of the Altai Krai, the Tyumen Oblast, the Yaroslavl Oblast, and the Kirov Oblast still rarely study the issue of improving financial work. In 1953, these regions illegally used state funds for the expenses of administrative management personnel, for unplanned investment, and other expenses. It is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings in the implementation of the budget, improve the work of completing revenue, strengthen the inspection of whether budget allocations are used correctly, supervise the economic and financial activities of various enterprises, organizations, and institutions, and practice economy in the use of state funds.

    Improving Labor Productivity, Reducing Production Costs, and Practicing Economy are the Most Important Conditions for Completing the Budget

    Comrade Deputies! To successfully complete the 1954 national budget, it is necessary to resolutely increase internal economic accumulation and use funds most rationally and economically. The continuous expansion of production, the systematic reduction of production costs and circulation expenses, and the practice of economy in the expenditure of funds were and still are the basis for increasing internal economic accumulation.

    The 1954 national budget stipulates that, based on the tasks in the national economic plan regarding increasing product output and reducing product costs, income should be obtained from the socialist economy. The plan stipulates that the cost of industrial products should be reduced by 4.4 percent, the cost of railway transportation should be reduced by 2.6 percent, the cost of construction and installation projects should be reduced by 3 percent, and circulation expenses should be reduced by 4.7 percent. Various enterprises and economic organizations will generate a total of 123.2 billion rubles in profits this year, which is 33.4 billion rubles more than in 1953. As mentioned above, the income from profit retention stipulated in the 1954 budget is 92.6 billion rubles, which is 22.3 billion rubles more than in 1953.

    Continuously improving the productivity of social labor is of paramount importance for reducing the cost of industrial products. Our country has created all the conditions for rapidly improving labor productivity. The development of heavy industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, has enabled all sectors of the national economy to obtain advanced technical equipment, enabling the extensive mechanization of heavy and laborious work, and enabling the electrification and automation of production.

    The Soviet national economy has skilled workers, engineers, technicians, and other experts and economic leaders. Workers and staff are now being trained on a large scale, and their skills are being improved. In 1954, the state allocated 3.1 billion rubles from the budget and other sources to train approximately 8 million cadres and workers and staff engaged in general occupations to improve their skills, and allocated 5.4 billion rubles to train labor reserve cadres.

    Many economic sectors have not fully utilized all the existing potential for improving labor productivity. In the first quarter of 1953 and 1954, the Soviet Ministry of Wood and Paper Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Transportation and Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Industry, the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry, and the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry did not complete the task of improving labor productivity due to serious shortcomings in production organization. The situation in labor productivity in the wood industry and the coal mining industry is particularly bad.

    In the Soviet Ministry of Wood and Paper Industry, under the condition of the rapid improvement of the mechanization level of logging, the amount of wood transported per worker in 1953 was 4 percent less than in 1940. The labor productivity plan of the logging industry has not been completed in the past few years, and the output per worker has almost remained at the original level. In some joint factories, such as the "Udmurt Logging Field" and the "Sverd Logging Field", the labor productivity in 1953 was even lower than in 1952.

    Despite the constant and great assistance given by the government, the Ministry of Coal Industry has not completed the task of improving labor productivity. In 1953, more than half of the coal mines did not complete the task of improving labor productivity. Some coal mines and joint enterprises have not even reached the pre-war labor productivity. For example, in 1953, the amount of coal mined per worker in the "Voroshilovgrad Coal Industry" joint enterprise was even lower than before the war. One of the reasons that hinder the improvement of labor productivity in the wood, coal, and other industrial sectors is that the machines are not well utilized, and there are serious shortcomings in labor organization.

    In logging enterprises, by the end of 1953, only one-quarter of the complete winches for sliding wood and a little more than one-half of the tractors and trucks for transporting wood were working, and the production quotas of these machines themselves were not completed.

    In 1953, the utilization rate of coal mining combines, coal cutting machines, and coal loading machines in individual coal mines only reached 55 to 60 percent. The output in the last ten days of each month in many enterprises is much higher than in the first ten days, and this uneven work situation has a negative impact on labor productivity. This makes it impossible to fully utilize the equipment and to rationally use labor.

    The national economic development plan for 1954 stipulates that the labor productivity in industry should be increased by 8.3 percent, and the labor productivity in construction should be increased by 8.6 percent. The current urgent task is to make the issue of caring about vigorously improving labor productivity the center of all work to guide the further development of the national economy. It is necessary to launch a truly broad people's movement to strive to greatly improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, and improve product quality in every industrial enterprise, every construction project, transportation sector, every collective farm, state-owned farm, and machine tractor station. The broad masses of working people in our country have very enthusiastically participated in the competition initiated by advanced enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast to complete the 1954 national plan ahead of schedule, to further improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, and improve their quality.

    The issue of how to organize production and correctly lead the economy has a very significant impact on accelerating the improvement of labor productivity. It is necessary to improve the level of production organization, widely adopt advanced working methods, organize work according to the circulation system, and produce products according to instruction charts. It is necessary to specialize production and cooperate industrial enterprises on a large scale, and strive to standardize and unify the production technology of spare parts, components, and certain manufactured products. It is necessary to carefully improve the work of labor technical quotas in enterprises.

    It must be pointed out that enterprises that cannot complete the plan to improve labor productivity usually cannot complete the task of reducing product costs and accumulating funds. The Ministry of Wood and Paper Industry has been unable to complete the national plan for logging and transporting wood for years, and cannot guarantee the growing needs of the national economy for wood. As pointed out earlier, the labor productivity of logging is very low and the cost is very high. In recent years, this sector has been a deficit sector. For example, the wood industry had a deficit of 1.4 billion rubles in 1951, 1.8 billion rubles in 1952, and 2.2 billion rubles in 1953. In 1953, the cost of logging enterprises not only did not decrease by 3 percent as stipulated in the plan, but greatly increased compared with 1952. The plan to reduce product costs in the enterprises of the Ministry of Coal Industry was not well implemented either. Most of the trusts and joint enterprises of the Ministry of Coal Industry often did not complete the task of reducing costs. In 1953, the cost of various products of the Ministry of Coal Industry exceeded the plan by more than 700 million rubles. Saving the raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity required for each product, reducing the losses caused by defective products, and eliminating other non-production expenses are of great significance for reducing costs and fully utilizing economic resources. The leaders of many economic sectors have not made due efforts to fully utilize internal production potential and allow the existence of losses caused by defective products and non-production expenses. The losses caused by defective products in industrial enterprises under the jurisdiction of various ministries of the All-Union reached 3.2 billion rubles in 1953. In the open-hearth workshops of steel enterprises, 238,000 tons of metal were additionally consumed due to the failure to use raw materials and materials according to regulations, and 200,000 tons of metal were additionally consumed in rolling workshops. In the fishing industry, the waste products, non-production expenses, and other losses in 1953 amounted to approximately 300 million rubles. The reason why the cost of some products is very high is often because the ministries and general administrations do not pay due attention to reasonably allocating production plans according to different enterprises, considering the division of labor of each enterprise and the cooperation between various enterprises, while ensuring that their work can obtain profits. All of this makes products expensive. There are many such facts: in some enterprises with almost completely the same conditions, the cost of similar products varies greatly. For example, in 1953, it took 54,400 rubles to manufacture a pre-assembled house of the same type in an enterprise of the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry, while it took 75,600 rubles in an enterprise of the Ministry of Construction; for the manufacture of another pre-assembled house of the same type, the former cost 56,000 rubles, while the latter cost 92,000 rubles. Even for a relatively simple product such as glassware, there are differences in the cost of various such products produced in similar enterprises. For example, the cost of a cup produced by the Gus Glassware Factory is one and a half times the cost of a similar cup produced by the Jazikov Glassware Factory. Also, the cost of a jar produced by the Gus Glassware Factory is more than twice the cost of a similar jar produced by the Jazikov Glassware Factory. This is because the Gus Glassware Factory consumes too much raw materials and electricity, has a lot of waste products, and has other non-production losses.

    The issue of using tools and packaging is worth serious attention. The consumption in this area in the national economy reaches tens of billions of rubles. Until now, a large number of general-purpose tools are still manufactured by the enterprises themselves, which is much more expensive than manufacturing in tool manufacturing enterprises, thus causing considerable losses to the national economy. Due attention has not been paid to the careful use of tools. The experience of advanced enterprises proves that as long as repair and patching are properly organized, 20 to 25 percent of the tools can be saved. The use of packaging can also be greatly saved. According to very incomplete statistics, the annual expenditure in this area in the national economy is more than 10 billion rubles. Currently, the utilization rate of a large part of the old packaging, especially old wooden packaging, does not exceed 15 to 20 percent. The rational use of packaging can save a lot of money for the national economy. The use of old wooden packaging alone can save millions of cubic meters of wood and many billions of rubles a year.

    There is also a great potential for further reducing costs in automobile transportation. In recent years, a series of measures have been taken to improve the work of automobile transportation. However, the cost of automobile transportation is still high. The utilization of trucks is often unsatisfactory. The phenomenon of empty trucks is serious, and trucks often spend half of their working time waiting for loading and unloading. The degree of mechanization of loading and unloading work is still low. All of these factors make transportation costs high. The concentrated transportation of goods plays a major role in reducing the cost of automobile transportation. The method of concentrated transportation of goods implemented in Moscow can save a large number of staff for other economic sectors and can improve the work of automobile transportation. The utilization rate of automobiles has increased: it has increased by 2.8 times in the process of transporting bricks, by 4.3 times in the process of transporting coal, and by 4.7 times in the process of transporting steel. In 1953, after the implementation of concentrated transportation, the expenses of enterprises and construction projects in the transportation of goods were reduced by 39 percent.

    Improving product quality has particularly significant national economic significance. The victorious solution of this task can save a lot of social labor. Producing high-quality machines and equipment that meet modern technical standards can improve their productivity and extend their service life, can improve labor productivity and reduce product costs. Improving the quality of consumer goods is one of the important conditions for improving the material welfare of the working people. Soviet commodities should be strong and beautiful and can fully meet the growing needs and preferences of customers. However, there are still some enterprises that continue to produce low-quality products and do not strictly abide by national standards and technical conditions. In 1953, 16 percent of the machines delivered by the agricultural machinery manufacturing plants in Tashkent and Taganrog were deemed unqualified by the inspectors of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and returned for repair. There are also many examples of manufacturing low-quality consumer goods. It is necessary to resolutely eliminate the shortcomings that cause low product quality, and it is necessary to ensure that every enterprise produces high-quality parts and commodities. The Soviet state allocates a large amount of funds every year for basic construction. Therefore, reducing construction costs is of great significance. Advanced construction enterprises have valuable experience in organizing construction projects, and promoting this experience can improve the quality of construction, shorten the construction period, and reduce its costs. However, many construction enterprises have not been able to complete the task of reducing the cost of construction projects stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, and there are large losses. In many construction projects, the work is not organized rationally, and there are still phenomena of labor turnover, worker downtime, and mechanical downtime. The construction of many enterprises, buildings, and projects cannot be completed on schedule, resulting in an increase in the phenomenon of unfinished construction projects. This is the case with the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry. In many construction projects and construction enterprises, the phenomenon of dispersion of materials and funds has not been eliminated. Many of them are small enterprises that cannot effectively utilize machines and machinery.

    In 1953, the construction and installation work of the construction organizations of the Soviet Ministry of Construction exceeded the cost stipulated in the plan by 9 percent. Therefore, not only was it not able to obtain 1.1 billion rubles in profit as stipulated in the plan, but it lost more than 700 million rubles. In addition, some ministries exceeded the construction costs stipulated in

    在苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院联席会议上
    兹维列夫关于苏联一九五四年国家预算的报告
    代表同志们！苏联政府提交最高苏维埃审查的一九五四年国家预算草案，反映出国民经济各部门将要进一步发展，保证有必要的资金来发展重工业、实现党和政府所拟订的使农业高涨和进一步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平的措施，并保证国防力量的进一步加强。
    预算草案中规定为重工业拨出大量资金，因为重工业一直是发展社会主义国民经济各部门和加强我国国防力量的基础的基础，是苏联人民过幸福生活的基础。由于胜利地执行和超额执行第五个五年计划所规定的任务，我们的重工业在一九五三年取得了新的、巨大的成就。生产资料工业的总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十二。一九五三年，石油、铁矿、锰矿的开采计划，铝、电力、母机、载重汽车和小汽车、锅炉、柴油机、炼铁和炼钢设备以及其他发展国民经济各部门所必需的生产资料的生产计划，都已超额完成了。去年，我国机器制造业生产了许多新型和新牌号的机器和机械，足以保证国民经济在技术上的进一步发展。许多新式的动力、电气、采油、采煤和冶金设备以及使煤矿、矿山企业和建筑工程中的费力操作机械化的各种设备已经制造出来。许多新式的生产效能高的轻工业和食品工业的设备，以及新式的农业机器已经制造出来。在黑色和有色金属冶炼业、电力站、采煤工业、石油工业、化学工业、机器制造业以及木材和造纸工业、建筑业和建筑器材工业方面的投资额是大大地增加了。一九五三年对这些工业部门的投资在八百亿卢布以上。进一步发展铁路运输、海上和内河运输、汽车运输与邮电等交通运输部门的投资额和建设公路的投资额约达一百八十亿卢布。
    在过去发展重工业方面已取得成就的基础上，一九五三年开始实行党和政府关于大力扩大消费品生产和提高农业的决议，这种情况反映在国家预算的执行上。
    除去在重工业部门实行庞大的建设计划外，还广泛地进行建设生产食品和日用品的企业。一九五三年下半年用于这项建设的投资几乎为上半年的一倍半。一年中约有三百个新的、生产消费品的企业投入生产。消费品工业在一九五三年以更快的速度发展了；它的产品产量在上半年比一九五二年同期增加百分之九，在下半年比一九五二年同期增加百分之十四。一九五三年的消费品生产计划是超额完成了。
    在发展农业的措施方面，去年由预算和国家其他资金中共支出五百二十三亿卢布，其中基本投资额约占一百二十亿卢布，这部分资金是用来制备拖拉机、联合机、汽车、各种农业机器和农具以及建设机器拖拉机站的。提高农业的最重要的一个条件就是正在实行的、在经济上提高集体农庄和集体农庄庄员对发展和加强公有农业生产的利益。为了这个目的，去年曾提高了集体农庄和集体农庄庄员义务交售给国家的畜产品、马铃薯和蔬菜的价格；增加了国家以较高价格收购粮食、肉类、牛奶、马铃薯和蔬菜的数量。这一切都使集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的收入有一定的增加。一九五三年，集体农庄和集体农庄庄员从义务交售和出售给国家的农产品方面所得的现金收入，几乎比一九五二年增加百分之四十五。一九五三年因农产品的征购和收购价格提高而由预算中额外开支的款项约占九十亿卢布。由于现金收入的增长，一九五三年集体农庄存入国家银行的资金增加了百分之八十五，而集体农庄存入农业银行的公积金增加了百分之三十二。按照苏联最高苏维埃上次会议的决定，去年大大降低了集体农庄庄员和其他公民的个人经营的生产的农业税。由于农业税的降低和许多其他税收方面的优待，集体农庄庄员和其他从事农业的居民又获得了为数约五十亿卢布的好处。
    一九五三年零售贸易额显著地增加了。政府采取了增加商品总量的办法。一九五三年消费品销售总额，按比较价格计算，比一九五二年增加百分之二十一；消费合作社在农村出售的商品比一九五二年多百分之二十四。去年实行的减低消费品零售价格是近几年来实行的规模最大的几次减价当中的一次。去年居民从这次减低物价中共获得了为数五百多亿卢布的好处。
    苏联一九五三年的国民收入比一九五二年增加了百分之八，这样就有可能来提高人民的消费水平。工人、职员和农民一九五三年的总收入按比较价格计算比一九五二年增加了百分之十三。
    一九五三年预算中对社会和文化设施的拨款为一千二百八十八亿卢布。一九五三年，苏联人民从国家预算中（减低零售价格及其他增进劳动人民的物质福利的开支计算在内）共获得了一千九百五十亿卢布，而一九五二年是一千四百七十亿卢布。
    同时，一九五三年，劳动人民从个人的收入中用交纳赋税和认购公债的形式为预算提供的资金达六百五十亿卢布，即比一九五二年减少了二百一十亿卢布。因此，一九五三年工人、集体农庄庄员和职员从预算中所获得的要比他们从个人的收入中缴入预算的多一千三百亿卢布，而一九五二年是多六百一十亿卢布。
    在社会主义生产和国民收入增长的基础上，国家的财政进一步巩固了。根据初步统计，一九五三年苏联国家预算的执行情形如下：收入五千三百九十七亿卢布，支出五千一百四十八亿卢布，收入超过支出二百四十九亿卢布。同往年一样，这样就有可能增加对国民经济的信贷投资和更进一步加强我们苏维埃货币。
    苏联一九五四年国家预算
    代表同志们！现在把苏联一九五四年度的国家预算提交最高苏维埃批准。预算的收入是五千七百一十八亿卢布，支出是五千六百二十七亿卢布，收入超过支出九十一亿卢布。预算反映了我们党和政府奉行的和平经济和文化建设的政策，进一步发展重工业并在这个基础上全面发展农业和大大增加消费品生产的政策。
    国家预算的绝大部分资金用于发展工业、农业、运输、贸易及国民经济其他部门，用于提高苏联人民的物质和文化福利。
    预算资金的用途
    一九五四年用于国民经济的资金为三千二百六十七亿卢布，其中从国家预算中拨付二千一百六十三亿卢布，由各经济组织的资金中拨付一千一百零四亿卢布。国家在国民经济方面的支出比一九五三年的初步总结多百分之十九点八。计划拨出一千八百四十九亿卢布作为基本投资和增加国民经济的流通资金之用，其中由预算中拨出一千二百一十一亿卢布。巨额的基本投资使得有可能大大增加一九五四年工业、农业、运输业和国民经济其他部门的固定资金，建造许多新工厂、电力站、矿场，并扩大住宅和文化及社会福利设施的建设。
    国民经济发展计划和预算草案规定，要进一步发展重工业，因为它对保证生产资料的扩大再生产以及保证迅速提高农业和轻工业有决定性的作用。对黑色和有色金属冶炼业、电力站、采煤工业、石油工业、化学工业、机器制造业、木材和造纸工业、建筑业和建筑材料工业的基本投资大大增加。一九五四年对这些工业部门的基本投资额在九百亿卢布以上，即几乎比去年增加一百亿卢布。一九五四年，要保证进一步提高铣铁、钢、钢材的产量，煤、石油开采量，发电量，设备的产量，以及重工业其他各种产品的产量。
    在建设食品工业企业和日用品工业企业方面拨出一百四十亿卢布以上，而一九五三年为七十六亿卢布。今年消费品的产量将达到第五个五年计划所规定的一九五五年的水平。这就是说，消费品生产方面的五年计划将提前在四年之内完成。
    一九五四年，为实行发展农业的措施拨出巨额款项。国家由预算和其他来源拨出七百四十四亿卢布来发展农业，即比一九五三年增加百分之四十二点四。一九五四年规定在农业方面的基本投资为二百一十亿卢布，即约比一九五三年增加百分之八十。为了执行党和政府关于发展农业的决议中提高征购和收购价格、减低赋税的规定，一九五四年比一九五二年将多支出四百七十亿卢布。在发展农业的预算拨款中，用来进一步加强机器拖拉机站的拨款占了显著的地位，今年在这方面将拨出三百零八亿卢布，即比一九五三年增加一百零二亿卢布。在发展国营农场方面拨出了大笔资金。用于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的资金完全有保证。由于一九五三年提高了农产品征购和收购价格，并增加了国家的收购量，一九五四年的预算中要支出二百三十三亿卢布，这将进一步提高集体农庄和集体农庄庄员在发展公有经济中的经济利益。根据苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的决议而修改的农民的纳税制度，已经对发展集体农庄庄员的私人牧畜业发生了积极的影响，并将使宅旁园地得到更好的利用。由于税额的减低，集体农庄庄员和其他从事农业的居民一九五四年所缴的税款，将比一九五二年减少八十二亿卢布。
    在一九五四年，要提前完成五年计划规定的商品流转任务。按比较价格计算，一九五四年的商品流转额将比一九五零年增加百分之七十五，而第五个五年计划为一九五五年规定的任务只比一九五零年增加百分之七十。不久以前实行的再次减低食品和制成品国家零售价格，使居民全年至少可以另外获得二百亿卢布的利益。今年预算中在这方面也拨出必要的资金。在第五个五年计划的头四年中（一九五一—一九五四年），消费品的国家零售价格比一九五零年的水平降低百分之二十五强。苏联居民现在购买的食品和工业品，其价格要比一九四七年的价格低百分之五十六点五。预算中还规定进一步增加贸易机关的流动资金，以使商品种类扩大。
    由于生产增加和商品流转额扩大，一九五四年国民经济发展计划规定各运输部门的货物运转额也要扩大。用来发展一九五四年各运输部门的款项达三百八十八亿卢布，其中由预算拨出二百一十四亿卢布，在这方面基本投资额占一百八十六亿卢布，即比一九五三年增加百分之五强。
    代表同志们！不断提高我国人民的物质生活水平和发展社会主义文化始终是共产党和苏联政府不倦关怀的对象。今年用于社会和文化设施方面的款项规定为一千四百一十三亿卢布，即几乎比去年预算执行情况的初步总结多百分之十。用在普及教育、培养干部、发展科学和艺术以及其他文化教育事业方面的款项为六百七十一亿卢布，用在公共卫生和体育方面的款项为二百九十三亿卢布，用在社会保险、养老金和子女众多的母亲和单身母亲的津贴的款项为四百四十九亿卢布。
    一九五四年，初等学校、中等学校、技术专科学校和高等学校中的学生人数将要增加。这一年，在中等学校毕业的学生人数将增加为一九五三年的两倍左右，这就证明：在实现第十九次党代表大会规定的发展普及中等教育的任务方面，将有重大的成就。一九五四年，高等学校和技术专科学校将招收一百万人以上。
    为发展苏联科学拨出很大一笔资金。一九五四年从预算及其他来源中为苏联科学院、各加盟共和国科学院和科学研究所拨出九十五亿多卢布。
    一九五四年预算中增加对医院、联合诊疗所、诊疗所、产育院、托儿所及其他卫生机构的拨款；休养所疗养院将要增多。一九五四年国家预算中用于社会和保险方面的经费规定为二百四十七亿卢布，比去年多百分之六点七。这部分资金将用于支付暂时失去劳动力的补助金、养老金、疗养所和休养所的休养疗养费用，以及工人和职员的其他需要。
    政府规定在一九五四年要实行住宅建筑的广泛计划；用于国家住宅建筑的经费为二百五十五亿卢布，大大地超过去年在这方面的开支。由于国家对社会和文化设施的开支的增加、国家消费品零售价格的再次减低以及农产品征购和收购价格的提高和其他的许多措施，苏联的居民一九五四年将从预算中获得比一九五三年约多四百五十亿卢布的好处。
    苏维埃国家一方面执行着和平经济和文化建设的广泛计划，另一方面也经常关心自己的国防。一九五四年预算中规定国防费用的开支为一千零三亿卢布，即为全部预算支出的百分之十七点八。苏联国家预算中所规定的这一开支数额，保证必要的防御能力和保证改善保卫着苏联人民的和平劳动和我们祖国安全的苏联武装力量。
    苏维埃国家的和平政策的出发点是：和那些愿意发展经济关系的国家发展经济关系是加强国际合作的重大因素。苏联坚持不渝地扩大和其他国家的贸易联系，而帝国主义国家的统治集团，首先是美国的统治集团则百般阻挠和苏联发展贸易。帝国主义国家的这种政策首先损害这些国家自己的经济，降低这些国家的居民的就业率和他们的生活水平。正因为如此，所以苏联巩固和平和扩大跟外国的事务和经济关系的政策，在那些极其关心维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势的国家的广大居民阶层中获得了热烈的支持。
    预算的收入
    预算收入的资金完全可以保证预算草案中规定的支出。在一九五四年国家预算中，像在一九五三年国家预算中一样，来自社会主义企业的收入大大增多，而同时又进一步降低居民的赋税额。
    一九五四年在苏联国家预算收入总额五千七百一十八亿卢布中，来自社会主义经济的收入占四千九百七十亿卢布，即占预算全部收入的百分之八十六点九。预算中来自社会主义企业和机构的收入是根据已批准的国民经济生产计划和减低产品成本的计划制订的。其中周转税的收入为二千三百四十三亿卢布，各企业和机构的利润提成为九百二十六亿卢布。保证预算收入的必要条件是：每个企业完成所规定的产品的生产计划和减低成本的计划，严格遵守财政纪律，在经济和财政工作的各个岗位上厉行节约。国家预算规定一九五四年居民纳税总额为四百五十七亿卢布，即占预算收入部分的百分之八。农业税的收入预定为四十二亿卢布。一九五四年农民纳税的标准和一九五二年相比减少了五分之三。
    一九五四年预算规定居民购买公债的总额为一百五十九亿卢布。国家预算今年对公债的奖金及还本拨款为一百零五亿卢布。我国居民福利增长的标志之一就是劳动储金的大量增加。一九五四年预计居民储蓄的款项将增加九十五亿卢布，今年年底的储蓄总额将达四百八十亿卢布。
    各加盟共和国的预算
    一九五四年，各加盟共和国的国家预算（包括加盟共和国的和地方的预算）总额为一千一百九十五亿卢布，即比一九五三年增加一百三十七亿卢布。一九五四年各加盟共和国预算之所以大为增加，是与各该共和国的部长会议以及地方劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会所面临的一些极重要的任务直接有关的，这些任务就是进一步发展共和国国民经济的各部门——工业、农业、住宅—公用事业建设、道路建设，保证消费品生产急速增加和文化建设大大高涨。共和国预算中对共和国企业和地方企业的拨款为三百五十五亿卢布，如包括各企业本身的资金在内，则为五百六十九亿卢布，即比一九五三年增加百分之五十六点六。今年对发展地方工业和燃料工业的基本投资比一九五三年增加百分之四十五。共和国预算和地方预算中有很大一笔款项用于社会和文化设施。一九五四年为这些目的拨出七百三十二亿卢布，其中教育经费占四百一十四亿卢布，公共卫生和体育经费占二百二十七亿卢布。一九五四年各加盟共和国的预算额如下：
    加盟共和国名称　预算额（以百万卢布为单位）
    俄罗斯联邦　六六五七○
    乌克兰　二二九八八
    白俄罗斯　四二八九
    乌兹别克　三七三八
    哈萨克　五三一三
    格鲁吉亚　二七七五
    阿塞拜疆　二○五七
    立陶宛　一七四一
    摩尔达维亚一四○六
    拉脱维亚　一六五四
    吉尔吉斯　一二五○
    塔吉克　一二七二
    亚美尼亚　一二二一
    土库曼　一○七五
    爱沙尼亚　一一七九
    卡累利阿—芬兰　九五○
    各加盟共和国预算所规定的收入必须能如期收齐，预算的支出应正确地和有效地使用。但是个别加盟共和国的和地方的机构在动用预算所规定的资源时还不够坚决，并且违反了利用资金的规定。这里必须指出，吉尔吉斯共和国和土库曼共和国最近两年来的预算都没有完成。乌拉季米尔州和新西伯利亚州一九五三年也没有完成预算。对共和国和地方所属的经济机构执行生产和财政计划的监督仍然不够。因此，卡累利阿—芬兰共和国、巴什基尔自治共和国和沃罗湼日州的许多企业和经济组织一九五三年没有完成赢利和上缴利润的计划，并且发生了流动资金不足的情形。阿尔泰边疆区、第乌门州、雅罗斯拉夫州和基洛夫州的劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会仍很少研究改善财政工作的问题，一九五三年这些地区把国家的资金非法地用作行政管理人员的经费，用作超计划的投资及其他费用。必须消除执行预算方面的缺点，改善完成收入的工作，加强检查是否正确利用预算拨款并监督各企业、组织和机关的经济和财政的活动，使用国家资金时应厉行节约。
    劳动生产率的提高，生产成本的降低和节约制度是完成预算的最重要的条件
    代表同志们！要胜利完成一九五四年的国家预算，就要坚决增加内部的经济积累，并最合理地、最节省地利用资金。生产的不断扩大，生产成本和流转费用有系统的减低及在资金开支上厉行节约，过去是，今后仍然是增加内部经济积累的基础。
    一九五四年国家预算规定，根据国民经济计划中关于增加产品产量和降低产品成本的任务，要从社会主义经济中获得一笔收入。计划规定降低工业品成本百分之四点四，铁路运输成本百分之二点六，建筑和安装工程成本百分之三，流转费百分之四点七。各企业和经济组织今年共计要获得一千二百三十二亿卢布的利润，即比一九五三年多三百三十四亿卢布。上面说过，一九五四年预算中规定的利润提成收入为九百二十六亿卢布，即比一九五三年多二百二十三亿卢布。
    不断地提高社会劳动生产率对于降低工业品成本具有头等重要的意义。我国为迅速提高劳动生产率创造了一切条件。重工业特别是机器制造业的发展，使得国民经济的所有部门都得了先进的技术装备，使得繁重的和费力的工作能够广泛地机械化，使生产能够电气化和自动化。
    苏联国民经济拥有熟练的工人、工程师、技术人员及其他专家和经济领导干部。现在正在大规模地培养工人和职员，并提高他们的熟练程度。一九五四年，国家从预算和其他来源中拨出三十一亿卢布来培养约八百万名从事一般职业的干部和工人及职员，以提高他们的熟练程度，并为培养劳动后备干部拨出五十四亿卢布。
    许多经济部门远没有充分利用现有的提高劳动生产率的一切潜力。在一九五三年和一九五四年的第一季度，由于在生产组织方面存在着严重的缺点，苏联木材和造纸工业部、煤矿工业部、运输和重型机器制造工业部、苏联建筑材料工业部和苏联食品工业部没有完成提高劳动生产率的任务。木材工业和煤矿工业在劳动生产率方面的情况特别不好。
    在苏联木材和造纸工业部方面，在伐木业机械化水平急速提高的情况下，一九五三年每个工人的木材运输量比一九四零年少百分之四。伐木业的劳动生产率计划在过去几年中没有完成，每个工人的生产量几乎还停留在原来的水平上。在某些联合工厂中，譬如“乌德摩尔特伐木场”和“斯维德伐木场”，一九五三年的劳动生产率甚至比一九五二年降低了。
    尽管政府不断给予极大的帮助，采煤工业部也没有完成提高劳动生产率的任务。一九五三年，有一半以上的煤矿没有完成提高劳动生产率的任务。甚至有些煤矿和联合企业还没有达到战前的劳动生产率。例如，一九五三年“伏罗希洛夫格勒煤业”联合企业每个工人的采煤量甚至比战前还低。阻碍木材、煤矿和其他工业部门劳动生产率提高的原因之一是因为没有很好地利用机器，以及在劳动组织中存在着严重的缺点。
    在伐木业企业中，到一九五三年底只有四分之一的完善的滑送木材的绞车和二分之一稍微多一点的运送木材的拖拉机和运木材的卡车工作，这些机械本身的生产定额没有完成。
    一九五三年，个别煤矿中采煤联合机、截煤机和装煤机的利用率只达到百分之五十五到六十。许多企业每月下旬的产量要比上旬多得多，这种不均衡的工作情形对劳动生产率发生了不好的影响。从而使设备不能得到充分的利用，劳动力不能得到合理的使用。
    一九五四年发展国民经济计划规定工业方面提高劳动生产率百分之八点三，建筑方面百分之八点六。目前的迫切任务是，应使关心大力提高劳动生产率的问题成为领导国民经济进一步发展的全部工作的中心。必须展开真正广泛的人民运动，争取在每个工业企业、每个建筑工程、运输部门、每个集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站中大大提高劳动生产率。我国广大的劳动群众已非常热情地参加了莫斯科市和莫斯科州先进企业发起的竞赛，争取提前完成一九五四年国家计划，争取进一步提高劳动生产率，减低产品成本并改善其质量。
    如何组织生产和正确地领导经济的问题，对加速提高劳动生产率具有极重大的意义。必须提高组织生产的水平，广泛采用先进的工作法，按循环制组织工作，按照指示图表生产产品。必须大规模地使生产专业化和工业企业合作化，尽力实行备件、部件和某些制件的生产技术的标准化和统一化。必须认真改进企业中劳动技术定额的工作。
    必须指出，那些不能完成提高劳动生产率计划的企业，通常也不能完成降低产品成本和积累资金的任务。木材和造纸工业部连年不能完成国家规定的伐木和运出木材的计划，不能保证国民经济日益增长的对木料的需要。前已指出，采伐木材的劳动生产率很低而成本则很高。近几年来，这一部门一直是一个亏蚀的部门。例如：木材工业在一九五一年亏蚀十四亿卢布，一九五二年亏蚀十八亿卢布，一九五三年亏蚀二十二亿卢布。一九五三年，伐木企业的成本不但没有按规定的计划降低百分之三，反而比一九五二年大大地提高了。煤矿工业部各企业的减低产品成本的计划执行得也不好。煤矿工业的大部分托辣斯和联合企业经常没有完成减低成本的任务。一九五三年煤矿工业部各种产品的成本比计划超过七亿卢布以上。节省使用每件产品所需要的原料、材料、燃料和电力，减少由于废品而遭到的损失和消灭其他非生产费用，对于减低成本和充分利用经济资源有重大的意义。许多经济部门的领导人没有作应有的努力来充分利用内部生产潜力，听任由于废品而遭到的损失和非生产费用等现象存在。全联盟各部所属工业企业由于废品而遭到的损失，在一九五三年达三十二亿卢布。在钢铁企业的平炉车间中，由于不按规定使用原料和材料，额外消耗了二十三万八千吨金属，在轧钢车间中，额外消耗了二十万吨金属。在捕鱼工业各企业中，一九五三年的废品、非生产费用和其他的损失约计三亿卢布。有些产品的成本之所以很高，往往是由于各部和总管理处没有适当注意按照不同的企业合理地分配生产计划，考虑每一个企业的分工和各个企业之间的合作，同时保证它们的工作能得到利润。所有这一切都使得产品昂贵。有不少这样的事实：在条件差不多完全相同的一些企业中，同类产品的成本悬殊很大。例如，一九五三年制造一所同样类型的预装配房子，在苏联建筑材料工业部的企业中需要五万四千四百卢布，而在建造部的企业中就需要七万五千六百卢布；又如制造另外一种同样类型的预装配房子，前者所需成本是五万六千卢布，而后者所需成本是九万二千卢布。甚至像玻璃器皿这样一种比较简单的产品，在同类企业中所生产的各种这样的产品的成本都有差别。例如，古斯玻璃器皿工厂所生产的一种杯子的成本为贾季科夫玻璃器皿工厂所生产的同类杯子的成本的一倍半。又如，古斯玻璃器皿工厂所生产的一种罐子的成本为贾季科夫玻璃器皿工厂所生产的同类罐子的成本的二倍多。这是由于古斯玻璃器皿工厂消耗的原料和电力过多，有很多的废品，还有其他非生产损失。
    使用工具和包皮的问题是值得严重注意的。国民经济中在这方面的消耗达数百亿卢布。直到现在为止，大量的一般用的工具仍由各企业自己制造，这比在工具制造业企业中制造要昂贵好多倍，因而使国民经济遭到不少的损失。对小心使用工具这一点尚未引起应有的注意。先进企业的经验证明，只要正确地组织修理和修补，就可以节省百分之二十到百分之二十五的工具。包皮的使用也还可以大大节省，据极不完全的统计，每年国民经济中花在这方面的费用达一百亿卢布以上。现在，很大一部分旧包皮、特别是旧木制包皮的使用率没有超过百分之十五至百分之二十。合理地使用包皮可以为国民经济节省很大一笔钱。仅使用旧的木包皮一项一年内就可节省数百万立方公尺的木料和许多亿卢布。
    在汽车运输方面也还大有进一步减低成本的可能。近几年来采取了一系列改善汽车运输工作的措施。但汽车运输的成本还高。载重汽车的利用往往不能令人满意。汽车空放的情形严重，汽车往往有一半工作时间来等待装货和卸货。装卸工作机械化的程度还低。这一切因素使运输成本高昂。货物的集中运送对降低汽车运输成本有重大的作用。莫斯科所实行的货物集中运送办法可以使其他经济部门节省大批的工作人员，可以改进汽车运输的工作。汽车的利用率提高了：在运砖过程中提高为二点八倍，在运煤过程中提高为四点三倍，在钢铁运输过程中提高为四点七倍。一九五三年，在实行集中运送之后，企业和建筑工程在货物运送方面的费用降低了百分之三十九。
    提高产品质量具有特别重大的国民经济意义。这项任务的胜利解决就可以大量节省社会劳动。出产符合现代化技术水平的高等质量的机器和设备可以提高它们的生产率和延长使用期限，可以使劳动生产率提高和产品成本降低。提高消费品的质量是提高劳动人民物质福利的重要条件之一。苏联的商品应该是结实美观，可以充分满足顾客日益增长的需求和爱好。可是，现在仍旧有一些企业继续出产质量低的产品，极不遵守国家规定的标准和技术条件。一九五三年，塔什干和塔干洛格的农业机器制造厂交出的机器有百分之十六被苏联农业部验收员认为不合格而退回修理。制造质量低的消费品的事例也不少。必须坚决消除造成产品质量低的缺点，必须保证每一企业都生产质量高的制件和商品。苏维埃国家每年拨出大笔资金用来从事基本建设。因而降低建筑成本就具有重大的意义。先进的建筑企业有着宝贵的组织建筑工程的经验，推广这些经验可以改进建筑的质量，缩短建筑期限和降低其成本。但是有许多建筑企业还不能完成五年计划中关于降低建筑工程成本的任务，而且有很大的亏损。在许多建筑工程中，没有合理地组织工作，还存在劳动力流动、工人窝工和机械停歇的现象，许多企业、大厦和工程的建筑不能按期完工，结果使建筑工程未完成的现象增多。如苏联石油工业部和苏联食品工业部就有这种情况发生。在许多建筑工程中和建筑企业中，还没有消除物资和资金分散的现像，其中有许多是不能有效地利用机器和机械的小企业。
    一九五三年苏联建造部各建筑组织的建造安装工作超过计划规定的成本百分之九，因此不仅没有能够按照计划规定获得十一亿卢布的利润，反而亏本七亿多卢布。此外还有一些部超过计划规定的建筑成本，苏联电站和电气工业部超过百分之十点三，苏联建筑材料工业部所属企业的建设工作超过建筑成本百分之六十二点八，苏联食品工业部超过百分之十二点七。改进设计预算的工作对完成基本建设工作和降低建筑成本有着重大的意义。许多建设工程往往因为没有及时得到设计预算书，以致施工遭到拖延。在建设中，远还没有足够普遍地采用标准设计和常用设计。大家知道，基本建设资金来源之一是充分利用建设工程的内部财力。但是，许多部和主管部门却容许建设工程所储备的材料和设备超过正常标准。这首先是指苏联黑色冶金工业部、石油工业部、电站和电气工业部。建设工程的领导者应当采取严肃认真的办法使材料和设备的储备量不超过规定的标准。进行长期投资的各银行应加强监督工作，监督各建设组织动用内部资源、执行减低建设成本和积累资金计划的任务并监督它们有计划地使用基本建设资金。
    党和政府向工业、农业、交通运输业及其他国民经济部门提出的任务，要求各企业和经济组织的每一个领导者加强对生产中的经济问题的注意。但是应该指出，经济组织中有许多领导者还没有对加强企业的财政管理问题给予足够的注意，没有监督财政状况。他们只是根据数量上的指标来估计计划完成得怎样，而没有充分地利用经济核算制，没有在物资和金钱的使用上实行应有的节约制度。必须纠正这种对待生产组织中的经济问题的态度。
    现在的任务就在于：利用财政来改善企业的管理，加强经济核算制和严格实行节约制度。苏联政府一方面把预算资金中的绝大部分都用来发展社会主义经济，一方面采取措施以尽量缩减与发展国民经济和满足居民需要无直接关系的开支。这首先关系到管理机关的开支，这种开支的数目仍很庞大。许多部和主管机关的领导者不是有系统地改进机关工作和精简机构，而是时常提出扩大管理机关的编制的问题。各部和机关的领导者应当坚决精简机构，力求改进机关工作和节约经费的开支。党和政府同时向财政系统的工作人员提出重大的要求，他们应当加强监督工作，监督各企业和管理机关执行减低成本和保证利润的任务，遵守节约制度和及时向上缴款。
    许多财政和银行机关对各企业和管理机关在财政上的直接监督还薄弱，没有发掘现有的减低生产成本的潜力，在对机关领导人提出关于克服管理机关工作中的缺点的问题方面，没有表现应有的积极性。财政和信贷机关的工作人员应当更认真地在财政上监督经济管理机关的工作，更深入地研究它们的经济和财政情况，并在改进财政经济管理工作方面给予它们必要的帮助。
    代表同志们！提交苏联最高苏维埃批准的一九五四年度苏联国家预算具有重大的国民经济意义，并将促进共产主义建设任务的实现。预算的执行在实现苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府所拟定的关于进一步发展社会主义经济和提高我国人民的物质和文化生活水平的计划中将起重大的作用。
