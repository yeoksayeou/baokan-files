Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency, on the evening of the 17th, the Vietnamese People's Army captured an enemy stronghold north of the Muong Thanh airfield, wiping out two defending platoons. They now control the northern half of the airfield, and in subsequent battles, eliminated approximately one enemy company of reinforcements.

The Muong Thanh airfield is one of the most important parts of the French army's entrenched camp at Dien Bien Phu. After the northern defense line of the Dien Bien Phu entrenched camp, which protected the airfield, fell into the hands of the People's Army in mid-March, the enemy had been trying to consolidate several strongholds around the airfield to protect it. In early April, the People's Army annihilated a company of the Foreign Legion defending the northern side of the airfield. Since then, the People's Army has been digging trenches through the enemy's barbed wire and destroying many of the enemy's bunkers. At the same time, the People's Army compressed towards the airfield from the Yom River in the east and from two directions in the west.

On the evening of the 17th, the eastern and western lines of the People's Army connected, and many trenches were joined in the center of the airfield, dividing the northern half of the airfield into many small sections. At this time, a platoon of the Foreign Legion and a puppet army paratrooper platoon stationed in the stronghold north of the airfield attempted to retreat to Muong Thanh. However, as soon as they left their stronghold, they were intercepted by the People's Army and retreated back to their defense. The People's Army then completely annihilated these enemy troops. The People's Army also repelled four attacks by an enemy paratrooper battalion and three tanks, eliminating approximately one enemy company and destroying one American-made tank.

    越南人民军已控制奠边府芒清机场北半部
    【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军于十七日晚占领了芒清机场以北的敌军据点，全歼守敌二个排，控制了机场的北半部，并在后续的战斗中又歼敌援兵约一个连。
    芒清机场是奠边府法军集团据点最重要的部分之一。在三月中旬掩护机场的奠边府集团据点北部防线落入人民军的手中后，敌人就一直力图巩固机场周围的若干据点，以便保护机场。四月上旬，人民军歼灭了防守机场北面的据点的外籍军团一个连。此后，人民军更通过敌人的铁丝网挖掘交通壕，摧毁了敌人的许多碉堡。同时，人民军从东面的约姆河和西面两个方向向机场压缩。
    十七日晚上，人民军东部和西部的战线接连起来了，许多交通壕在机场中心衔接起来，这样就把机场北半部分割成了许多小段。这时，驻在机场以北据点的外籍军团一个排和伪军一个伞兵排，企图撤退到芒清。但是，他们刚一离开据点，就受到人民军的截击，缩回了防地。接着人民军全歼了这些敌军。人民军还击退了敌军援兵一个伞兵营和三辆坦克的四次进攻，歼灭敌军约一个连，击毁美制坦克一辆。
