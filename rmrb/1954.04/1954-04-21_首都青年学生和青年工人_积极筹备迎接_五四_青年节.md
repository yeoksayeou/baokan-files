Xinhua News Agency, April 20th:

Capital youth students and young workers are actively preparing to commemorate and welcome the "May Fourth" Youth Day with joyful spirits.

Beijing University, in order to commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement and the school's 56th anniversary, is preparing to hold a school history exhibition. This exhibition reflects Beijing University's decades of struggle for democracy and freedom, as well as its learning life after liberation. Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Beijing College of Geology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Medical College and other schools will also hold cultural performances, sports meets, and new League member oath ceremonies around "May Fourth."

Many middle schools in Beijing are incorporating the ideological content of labor education for students when preparing for "May Fourth" activities. The affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University is preparing to hold a commemorative meeting, inviting students from the school to introduce their experiences in studying, exercising, and doing social work. All students in Class 2, Grade 1 of Beijing No. 8 Middle School are reading the article "Don't Seek an Easy Life" in the sixth issue of "China Youth," learning the spirit of Soviet youth pioneers who love labor. Some middle schools will also hold report meetings and forums to discuss issues related to labor education.

On the front lines of factories and basic construction, young workers are learning from Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation and using practical actions to welcome "May Day" and "May Fourth." Gui Yupeng, a member of the Youth League at Beijing People's Machinery Factory, completed the entire month's workload in fifteen days in April. He said: This is his gift for his first Youth Day since joining the League. The young people in Liu Jianjie's group in the machine shop of this factory have completed the entire month's production task in the first half of April. In order to welcome "May Day" and "May Fourth," they are determined to continue their efforts and strive to complete two months of production tasks within this month. At the forum for advanced young workers in construction enterprises held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, many young people put forward specific guarantees to welcome "May Day" and "May Fourth." The youth work section of the Soviet Exhibition Hall construction site has already completed the excavation task with a surplus of 22% since the start of construction. They also guarantee to complete 2,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete work before April 23 as a gift to "May Fourth."

    积极筹备迎接“五四”青年节
    【新华社二十日讯】首都青年学生和青年工人正以欢欣愉快的心情积极筹备纪念和迎接“五四”青年节。
    北京大学为了纪念“五四”和该校五十六周年的校庆，准备举行校史展览，这个展览反映出北京大学数十年来争取民主自由的斗争事迹和解放后的学习生活。清华大学、北京农业大学、北京政法学院、北京地质学院、北京钢铁工业学院、北京医学院等校也将在“五四”前后分别举行文艺表演，体育运动会和新团员入团宣誓等。
    北京市许多中学在筹备“五四”活动时，都结合对同学进行劳动教育的思想内容。北京师范大学附属女子中学准备召开纪念大会，请本校的同学介绍如何学习，锻炼身体和做好社会工作的经验。北京市第八中学高一二班全体同学正阅读“中国青年”第六期上“不找轻松的生活”一文，学习苏联青年拓荒者热爱劳动的精神，还有些中学将举办报告会、座谈会，讲述有关劳动教育的问题。
    在工厂和基本建设战线上，青年工人正在学习王崇伦的生产革新精神，以实际行动来迎接“五一”和“五四”。北京人民机器厂青年团员桂育鹏在四月份已经用十五天完成了全月的工作量。他说：这是他对自己入团后第一个青年节的献礼。这个厂机工车间刘建杰小组的青年们，四月上半月已完成了全月的生产任务，为了迎接“五一”和“五四”，他们决心保证继续努力，争取本月内完成两个月的生产任务。在青年团北京市委召开的建筑企业青年先进工作者座谈会上，许多青年为迎接“五一”和“五四”提出了具体保证。苏联展览馆工地的青年工段，自开工后已经以超额百分之二十二的成绩完成了挖槽的任务。他们并保证在四月二十三日前完成二千立方公尺钢筋混凝土工程，作为对“五四”的献礼。
