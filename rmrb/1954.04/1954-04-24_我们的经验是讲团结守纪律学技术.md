    Our Experience is to Emphasize Unity, Observe Discipline, and Learn Technology
    Li Shaokui, Steelmaking Worker at No. 8 Open Hearth Furnace, Steelmaking Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    This year, the comrades of our No. 8 open hearth furnace comprehensively and over-fulfilled the state plan in the first quarter. The output exceeded the plan by 13.5%, and the quality also exceeded the state's requirements. We produced the most high-quality steel among all the steelmaking furnaces in the plant, and there were the fewest changes in planned steel types. In terms of cost, according to incomplete statistics from September to December last year and January to March this year, a total of over 600 million yuan was saved.
    Why were we able to comprehensively and over-fulfill the state plan? The most fundamental point is that we regard fulfilling the state plan as the most important and central thing in our lives. We all know that our steelmaking plant has a very important responsibility in national construction. If we fail to complete the plan, various steel rolling mills will also be unable to complete the plan, and the country will not get enough seamless steel pipes, heavy rails, light rails, and various types of steel. We must produce steel according to the planned steel types. We must produce whatever steel the country needs. If the country needs heavy rail steel and we produce light rail steel, large steel rolling mills will have to stop work and wait for materials, and the country's funds will be tied up.
    Therefore, we attach great importance to the work plan and various quota indicators stipulated by the state. Every time we refine a furnace of steel, we strive to complete it and exceed it. For example, we come to work ten minutes early every day to hold a meeting, where I communicate the day's work plan to everyone, telling them what kind of steel this furnace is, what time it is scheduled to be tapped, when to charge the materials, how long to melt, how long to refine, and what issues to pay attention to at each stage. Everyone knows what to do today and who should do what, so they can prepare early and never have to scramble at the last minute. In order to ensure that steel is produced according to the steel type, we carefully calculate the batching according to the batching methods formulated by Soviet experts and strictly follow the operating procedures. In order to reduce costs and implement the fixed material steelmaking system, we carefully check the weight of various raw materials before charging and record the amount of each steel material charged in detail; during the operation, we try our best to use the same raw materials to refine more steel; before tapping, we carefully calculate how much steel this furnace can produce and prepare steel ladles of appropriate sizes to avoid waste; all raw materials on the furnace are kept by designated personnel, and they are never mixed together or exposed to moisture. Materials accidentally spilled on the ground during charging are also swept up and saved for the next time. We are three shifts of more than twenty people operating a steelmaking furnace together. The charging of this shift determines more than half of whether the next shift's work goes smoothly. Therefore, the concept of the whole is most important to steelworkers. Our three shifts are very united. What this shift should do is never pushed to the next shift, even if it is time to get off work, we will finish it before leaving. When taking over the shift, we often come early and help with the work before the shift starts. We are also very united with other furnaces and other shifts. For example, when other furnaces are repairing, we send everyone who is not needed here to help. Conversely, when we are repairing the furnace, other shifts are happy to help us. Therefore, the furnace repair time of our No. 8 furnace is always the shortest, with a quota of forty minutes, we always finish it in about thirty-five minutes. The raw material shift and the comrades in charge of the charging machine are also like this, and we get along very well.
    Of course, our unity is not unprincipled unity, but a unity based on criticism and self-criticism, and there are strict systems to ensure it. Within our team, we hold a trade union group meeting every week to exchange opinions and study methods to ensure the completion of the plan. We also hold meetings when there is free time on the furnace. If a problem occurs one day, we must hold a meeting the next day to find the cause, conduct criticism and self-examination, and determine what to do in the future. This kind of meeting only takes about ten minutes and solves problems very well. There is a three-shift joint meeting system between shifts, held every two weeks. At the meeting, we exchange experiences and check the shortcomings in the handover between shifts. Within the shift, the division of labor is very clear. Each comrade is responsible for a part of the work, and when handing over the shift, each finds their respective counterpart to explain the situation of the previous shift and the points that should be paid attention to in detail to the next shift so that they can accurately grasp the furnace for operation. For any problems that all three shifts need to do or solve together, we all discuss and pass them together. Like the annual team guarantee plan, the quarterly competition guarantee conditions, and the measures to protect the furnace body, everyone has discussed them, so everyone can consciously implement them with one heart. To do a good job in production, it is not enough to rely on unity, discipline, and operating procedures. We must also strive to improve our technical level, especially learning advanced experience. We all like to learn and experiment with new things. We always conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, cooperate closely with the technicians, listen to their guidance, report the situation to them in detail, and study the problems with them. Protecting the furnace is also a very important condition for increasing production. To protect the furnace body well, it is not enough to rely on individuals. We must mobilize everyone on the furnace. Now we have done this. After each furnace of steel is tapped, we must carefully check the furnace bottom, and if we find problems, we will study and repair them together. If the temperature in the furnace is too high, the furnace roof will easily melt; if the temperature is low, the melting time will be long, which will affect the tapping time. In order to maintain high-temperature melting in the furnace without burning the furnace roof, we have to look at it two to three times every minute. Therefore, the life of our furnace is the longest. For furnaces like ours, the furnace body has to be repaired after ten uses, but we can use it sixteen times; the state stipulates that the furnace roof should be used one hundred and thirty times, and we use it one hundred and ninety-one times. The longer the life of the furnace, the more time we have to work, and the utilization rate of our furnace is the highest in the plant. The leaders have calculated that if the utilization rate of all open hearth furnaces in the plant can reach our standard, our plant can increase the production of tens of thousands of tons of steel for the country every year. The simple reasons why we can often comprehensively and over-fulfill the state plan are these. I hope that all steelworkers in the country can refer to our approach and do better than us, so as to refine more and better steel for the country and accelerate our socialist construction.

    我们的经验是讲团结守纪律学技术
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂第八号炼钢炉炼钢工　李绍奎
    我们第八号炼钢炉的全体同志，今年第一季度全面地超额地完成了国家计划。产量超过计划百分之十三点五，质量也超过了国家的要求，在全厂各炼钢炉中，我们炼的优质钢最多，改变计划钢种的情况最少。在成本方面，根据去年九月到十二月和今年一月至三月的不完全统计，一共节约了六亿多元。
    为什么我们能够全面、超额完成国家计划呢？最根本之点是我们把完成国家计划当成生活里最重要最中心的东西。我们都知道：我们炼钢厂在国家建设中的责任是非常重大的。如果我们完不成计划，各个轧钢厂也就无法完成计划，国家就得不到足够的无缝钢管、重轨、轻轨和各种各样的钢材。我们必须按照计划钢种出钢。国家要什么钢就出什么钢，如果国家要重轨钢，我们出了轻轨钢，大型轧钢厂就要停工待料，国家的资金就要积压。
    因此，我们非常重视作业计划，重视国家规定的各种定额指标，每一天炼每一炉钢的时候都努力争取完成它、超过它。比如，我们每天上班以前都要早来十分钟开个碰头会，我把当天的作业计划传达给大家，告诉大家这一炉是什么钢，预定几点几分出钢，应该在什么时候装料、熔化多久、精炼多久，每个阶段都要注意什么问题。大家都知道了今天要做什么，谁该做什么，以后就能早早进行准备，从来没有临时抓瞎的。为了保证按钢种出钢，我们认真地按照苏联专家拟定的配料方法细致地计算配料，严格地按照操作规程操作。为了降低成本，贯彻定料炼钢制度，我们在装料以前认真地检查各种原料的重量，详细记录每一炉钢料的装入量；在操作中间尽量设法用同样的原料多炼出一些钢来；出钢以前又仔细计算这一炉能出多少钢，准备好大小适当的钢罐，以免浪费；炉上所有的原材料都各有专人负责保管，从来没有混在一起或受潮湿的情形，装料时不小心撒在地上的材料，也都扫起来留着下回用。我们是三个班二十多个人共同操纵一座炼钢炉。这个班装料，到下个班才能出钢。这个班工作顺利不顺利，一多半是由上个班操作好坏决定的。所以，对炼钢工人来说，整体观念是最重要的。我们三个班非常团结。该这班做的事决不推到下班，那怕到了下班时间，也要做完才走。接班的时候，常常是早些来，没到点就帮助上班干活。我们和别的炉子、别的班也很团结。譬如当别的炉子补炉的时候，我们这炉子除了离不开的人以外都去帮忙。反过来，我们补炉的时候，别的班也就很乐意来帮助我们。因此，我们八号炉补炉时间始终是最短的，定额四十分钟，我们总在三十五分钟左右就完。原料班和管装料机的同志们也是这样，和我们处得非常好。
    当然，我们这种团结不是无原则的团结，而是建立在批评与自我批评的基础上的团结，并且有严格的制度来保证。在我们班内，每个星期必定开一次工会小组会，互相提意见，研究保证完成计划的方法。在炉上有闲空的时候也开。如果头一天发生了问题，第二天一定要开会，找原因，进行批评检讨，确定今后怎么做。这种会不过十分钟，很解决问题。在班和班之间有三班联席会制度，两星期开一次。在会上交流经验，检查交接班中间的缺点。在班里，分工是很明确的。每个同志都负责一部分工作，到交班时各找各的对象，把上一班的情况和应该注意的地方都详细地交代给下一班，使他们能准确地掌握炉子进行操作。凡是三个班共同要做或要共同解决的问题，我们都是三个班共同讨论通过。像年度的小组保证计划、季度的竞赛保证条件、怎样保护炉体的措施，都经大家讨论过，所以大家都能同心一致地自觉地贯彻。要把生产搞好，光靠团结、遵守纪律和操作规程是不够的，还必须努力提高自己的技术水平，特别是学习先进经验。我们都很喜欢学习、试验新的东西。我们总是认真地贯彻苏联专家建议，和技师同志们密切合作，听取他们的指导，详细地向他们反映情况，和他们一起研究问题。把炉子保护好，也是提高生产的一个非常重要的条件。要把炉体保护好，单凭个人是不行的。必须把炉子上的每一个人都发动起来。现在我们已经做到了这一点，每出完一炉钢，我们都要很好地检查炉底，发现毛病大家就一起研究修补。炉子里的温度过高，炉顶就容易化；温度低，熔炼时间长，又要影响出钢时间。为了保持炉子里高温熔炼又不烧化炉顶，我们每分钟都要看两次到三次。因此，我们这个炉子的寿命最长，和我们同样的炉子，炉体使用十次就得检修，我们可以使用十六次；国家规定炉顶要使用一百三十次，我们使用了一百九十一次。炉子的寿命长了，干活的时间就多，我们炉子的作业率就是全厂最高的。领导上计算过，假如全厂所有的平炉作业率都能达到我们的标准，我们厂每年就能给国家增产好几万吨钢。我们所以能够经常全面地超额地完成国家计划，简单的道理就是这些。我希望全国的炼钢工人同志们都能参考我们这种做法，并且比我们做得更好，以便给国家炼出更多更好的钢来，加快我们的社会主义建设。
