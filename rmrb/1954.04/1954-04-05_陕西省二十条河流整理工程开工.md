To continue helping farmers overcome natural disasters and increase production, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau has decided to construct flood control projects on twenty rivers in the province that cause harm this year. Eight of these rivers will undergo major regulation, while the remaining twelve will undergo key flood control measures.

Currently, the river channel improvement projects are proceeding with enthusiasm and urgency. Some rivers have already established flood control committees; some are conducting construction surveys, and others are preparing materials for the projects. Construction on the Qianyou River began on February 19th. Work on the Feng River also commenced in mid-March. The earthwork for the Changjian, Liuye, and Luofu rivers was basically completed by the end of March. Most of these twenty river regulation projects will strive to be completed before this year's flood season.

This year's investment in flood control projects in Shaanxi Province is approximately 9 billion yuan. The amount of earthwork alone is more than 2 million cubic meters. After these rivers are widened, the riverbeds dredged, and the embankments reinforced, 250,000 mu of farmland, six towns, and more than one hundred villages can be protected from the threat of floods. At the same time, after the river channels are regulated, some of the water sources can also be used to irrigate fields.

    陕西省二十条河流整理工程开工
    陕西省人民政府水利局为了继续帮助农民战胜自然灾害，增加生产，决定今年在全省为害的二十条河流中兴修防洪工程。其中八条河流要大部分加以整理，其余十二条进行重点防洪。
    目前，整修河道工程正热烈紧张地进行着。有的河道已成立了防洪委员会；有的正进行施工测量，还有些河道工程正在做备料工作。乾佑河在二月十九日开始动工。沣河也已在三月中旬开工。长涧、柳叶、罗敷三条河土方工程在三月底已基本完成。这二十条河流整理工程，大部分要争取在今年汛期以前完成。
    今年陕西省的防洪工程投资约九十亿元。工程数量光土方就有二百余万公方。这些河流经过加宽河道，疏通河底，培厚堤岸后，可保护二十五万亩农田，及六座城镇和一百多个自然村免受洪水威胁。同时河道经过整理后，有些还可以利用水源灌溉田地。
