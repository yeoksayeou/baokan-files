The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union has recently purchased a large quantity of new-style farm implement parts and repair tools, which will soon be distributed to various counties to help farmers repair various new-style farm implements.

In recent years, farmers in Shanxi Province have purchased more than 190,000 pieces of new-style farm implements and waterwheels, etc. Some of these are no longer usable due to damage and lack of repair. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has allocated special funds to purchase repair tools. At present, the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union has purchased fifteen kinds of simple repair tools, such as adjustable wrenches, flat steel files, screwdrivers, saw blades, and twist drills, which will soon be distributed to various counties. In addition, a batch of waterwheel chain lifting tools, hydrochloric acid, etc., are being actively trial-manufactured and purchased.

The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union and the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture also purchased a batch of new-style farm implement parts, including 10,000 new-style seven-inch walking plowshares, 6,000 plow molds, 5,000 side plates, and more than 90,000 farm machinery sprayer parts. In addition, more than 20,000 waterwheel parts have been ordered in Taiyuan City.

After these repair tools and new-style farm implement parts are transported to various places, the supply and marketing cooperatives and related departments such as agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy in each county will equip technical cadres to jointly form repair teams to go deep into the countryside to help farmers repair new-style farm implements.

    山西省合作社联合社最近购妥大批新式农具零件和修理工具，即将分发各县，帮助农民修整各种新式农具。
    几年来，山西省农民购买的新式农具和水车等约有十九万余件，有些因损坏失修，已不能使用。山西省人民政府特拨出专款，购买修理工具。现在，山西省合作社联合社已购买到活搬手、钢扁锉、改锥、锯条、麻花钻等十五种简单修理工具，即将分发各县。另外还有一批水车起链工具、盐酸等正在积极试制和采购。
    山西省合作社联合社和山西省人民政府农业厅还购买了一批新式农具零件，计有新式七吋步犁犁铧一万个、犁镜六千个、侧板五千个，以及九万多件农械喷雾器零件等。此外，还在太原市订制了二万多件水车零件。
    这些修理工具和新式农具零件运到各地后，各县供销合作社和农林、水利等有关部门将配备技术干部，共同组成修配小组，深入农村帮助农民修理新式农具。
