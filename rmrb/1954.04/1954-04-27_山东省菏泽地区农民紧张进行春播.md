Farmers in the Heze area of Shandong Province are intensively carrying out spring planting. High-yielding grain crops, accounting for 80 percent of the spring planting area, have been sown. Millet and cotton are now being sown. This year, the area plans to plant more than 800,000 mu of cotton, a slight increase over last year. Fucheng County has increased its cotton planting by more than 10,000 mu compared to last year. Cao County alone has exceeded last year's cotton planting area by more than 3,600 mu in just four districts. After hearing the state's call for cotton planting, the Liu Bentian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liuzhuang, Second District, increased its planting plan by 77 mu.

Since last winter and this spring, the Heze area has extensively and thoroughly promoted the state's general task for the transition period to farmers, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have also greatly developed. Therefore, their winter plowing exceeded the historical level, reaching 88 percent of the land that should be plowed. Among them, the land plowed with new-style walking plows or double plows reached 90 percent. This spring, many farmers also carried out secondary plowing and harrowing. The Deng Fulong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liangshan County, a model of high yield, fully implemented winter plowing last winter and plowed the winter-plowed land twice this year. Before spring planting, leaders at all levels in the Heze area held special meetings to solve the difficulties in spring planting. More than 670 households in difficult circumstances in the Twelfth District of Shan County have been helped through the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams organizing contract farming and planting stations, or using labor in exchange for animal power, and all the problems of households in difficulty have been solved. During the spring planting, they also promptly solved the problems of improved varieties and technical guidance. The whole area supplied farmers with 210,000 jin of "Huanong No. 4" millet, a popular and high-yielding variety, 300,000 jin of "Si Zi" cotton seeds, and more than 400,000 jin of peanut seeds. In addition to this, they also vigorously mobilized the masses to exchange improved varieties and guided them in reasonable close planting, warm water soaking of seeds, and pesticide mixing of seeds. Supply and marketing cooperatives have also prepared a large number of waterwheels, sprayers, weeding hoes, and other agricultural tools, totaling more than 260,000 pieces, and 220,000 jin of pesticides for the masses. All of these have strengthened the masses' confidence in spring plowing and planting.

    山东省菏泽地区农民紧张进行春播
    山东菏泽地区农民正紧张进行春播。占春播面积达百分之八十的高粮作物，已播种完毕，现正播种谷子和棉花。今年全区计划植棉八十余万亩，较去年略有增加。复程县的棉花播种较去年增加一万余亩。曹县仅四个区现已超过去年植棉面积三千六百余亩。二区刘庄刘本田农业生产合作社，听到国家植棉号召后，比原来计划增加七十七亩。
    菏泽地区自去冬和今春普遍深入地向农民进行了国家在过渡时期总任务的宣传以后，农民的生产情绪很高，农业生产合作社和互助组也有了很大的发展。因此他们的冬耕地超过了历史的水平，达到应耕地的百分之八十八。其中用新式步犁或套二犁的耕地即达百分之九十。今年春天，很多农民又进行了二次耕耙，梁山县丰产模范邓福龙农业生产合作社，去冬全部实行了冬耕，今年又把冬耕地翻了二犁。在春播前，菏泽地区的各级领导，都召开了专门会议，解决春播中的困难问题。单县十二区的六百七十多户困难户，分别采取以农业生产合作社，互助组组织包耕包种站，或人工换畜力等方法，全部解决了困难户的问题。在春播中，他们还及时地解决了良种和技术指导的问题。全区供应农民所喜种多收的“华农四号”谷共二十一万斤，“斯字”棉种三十万斤，花生种四十余万斤。除此外，他们还大力发动群众互换良种，指导合理密植，温汤浸种，农药拌种等方法。供销合作社也为群众准备了大批水车、喷雾器、耘锄等农具二十六万余件，农药二十二万余斤。这些都加强了群众春耕播种信心。
