    On the Question of Revolutionary Cadres Studying Scientific Knowledge
    Hua Luogeng
    Stalin taught us: "To build, one must have knowledge, one must master science. And to have knowledge, one must study. Study tenaciously and patiently." Indeed, if we can follow the instructions of our great teacher, then, I believe, within three to five years, any revolutionary cadre will be fully confident in mastering the scientific knowledge required for our work.
    I. Self-study can achieve the purpose of learning, and perseverance and patience are the guarantee of success.
    Self-study is one of the methods of learning. We can say with certainty that anyone who develops the habit of self-study will benefit from it for the rest of their life. However, it is also incorrect to emphasize self-study and give up the opportunity to participate in collective learning. Some young cadres once said: There are too many subjects to learn in school and the progress is too slow, so it is better to study at home by oneself. This view is certainly inappropriate. Self-study can only be regarded as a supplementary method during formal learning, and a substitute method when it is impossible to participate in formal learning. It must be understood that studying in school (or attending any study class) has many advantages: First, it can provide systematic and comprehensive general knowledge needed by modern citizens; second, teachers with a higher level than us can lead us on the road faster, and can promptly point out the key points that are easily overlooked by us, and can also help us explain difficulties and reduce the time spent groping in the dark; third, there are checks and assessments, which can easily expose and promptly correct our shortcomings in learning; fourth, being with classmates, we can help each other and encourage each other. All of these cannot be obtained by self-study. But at the same time, we should also cultivate the habit of self-study, so that, on the one hand, we can supplement the deficiencies in learning, and on the other hand, we can be prepared to master "self-study" - this important learning method - when we cannot participate in learning.
    Self-study is a relatively arduous learning method, but its advantage is that it can be adopted by anyone, anytime, anywhere. As long as we can proceed step by step, unremittingly and tirelessly, over the years, it can help us reach the brilliant peak of science. Anyone with ordinary literacy can use self-study to expand their scope of knowledge. As far as mathematics is concerned, which I am familiar with, as long as we are willing to study on our own, we can enter the hall of mathematics.
    However, due to the lack of supervision and inspection, and the lack of leadership guidance, self-study often becomes uncontrolled, resulting in a lack of completion. I personally have had some painful experiences: due to impatience and wanting to achieve success overnight, I often overstepped the rules and advanced, which seemed to be very successful in the initial period, but once applied, it was found that it was not effective, but a half-baked effort. At this time, it was impossible to move forward, and unwilling to turn back, which almost made me lose confidence and stop halfway. Reheating a half-baked meal is a very unpleasant thing. I think there must be many people who study hard on their own and have had the same painful experience. Therefore, no matter which subject we study on our own, the most important thing is to avoid impatience and advance step by step, which is the best policy. If you unfortunately have the same experience as me, the only remedy is to start over from the beginning. Another shortcoming of self-study is that one often thinks that they understand, that they understand, that they can do the exercises in the book, and that they can memorize the theorems in the book, but looking back after a few years, the so-called understanding in the past is just a superficial and formal understanding, and once faced with principle changes, they fall into confusion. This shortcoming, although it may be extremely difficult to avoid in the learning process, can still be mitigated if one can think carefully during self-study. On the other hand, there are also some people who seem to understand the principles very well, but are unable to do anything in concrete application. In addition, problems such as starting strong and finishing weak, starting but not finishing, and "one day of exposure, ten days of cold" are not worth mentioning.
    In short, I think the main key to success in self-study lies in perseverance and patience. We should correctly understand why we are studying on our own, and we should also correctly understand that "self-study" is more difficult than "participating in formal learning," that it requires more time, and that trying to be fast and greedy is the enemy of success in self-study. We must use the attitude of "small streams converge to form rivers," persevere, and act in a well-ordered manner, in order to complete the purpose of self-study.
    II. Climbing a mountain is arduous, but the first part is still a wide road.
    Scientists often like to quote Marx's words in the preface and postscript to the French translation of "Capital": "There is no smooth road to science, only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path, have the hope of reaching the brilliant summit." This is an irrefutable truth. Every scientific worker should keep this in mind and deeply understand the meaning of these words. But if it is used for people who are learning science knowledge at the middle school level, it is too early. It may cause fear of difficulty. Science is a big mountain, the closer to the top, the more rugged the road, and even there are many areas where people have not been to, and scientists rely entirely on pioneers to discover the road. But at the foot of the mountain, due to the trampling of pedestrians for many years, a wide road has been formed, or steps have been built that can be climbed step by step. As long as we work tirelessly, we can move forward steadily. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, etc. in mathematics were all rugged paths in science hundreds of years ago, but today they have become flat roads. Teenagers of fourteen or fifteen can master it in a short period of time. Therefore, revolutionary cadres with rich life experience and struggle experience, with the help of their mature thinking ability, can quickly master these subjects without any problem, and are absolutely confident. But whether the results are rich or not depends on how much we pay.
    The higher the mountain, the harder it is to climb, but because we have gone through a period of exercise, and gradually enriched our experience on this basis, it is possible and we will be able to gradually climb to the peak.
    For experienced cadres: conquering scientific fortresses is no more difficult than conquering military fortresses. Scientific fortresses are unchanging goals, and we take a step forward, we take a step forward. If we can't conquer it today, there is still tomorrow. By tomorrow, the objective situation will only be more favorable to us. As long as we work hard step by step, we will always get closer and closer to victory.
    III. There is no secret learning method
    Learning science cannot be opportunistic, and there is no shortcut or secret fast learning method. We must not be able to thoroughly understand the six-year middle school curriculum in just a few months. We must recognize the long-term and arduous nature of learning scientific knowledge. One point of effort, one point of achievement. Only with diligent cultivation can we have a rich harvest. But on the other hand, if the person guiding the learning can grasp the characteristics of revolutionary cadres having mature thinking ability and carefully consider the planning, then it is possible to appropriately shorten the learning period. But it must not be shortened too much. Therefore, learners must first recognize the long-term and arduous nature of learning, and adjust their pace to move forward as quickly as possible. If you take advantage of a moment of courage and rush forward like a charge, you will inevitably find it difficult to continue in the future. Although there is no opportunistic method for learning science, there are indeed some matters that should be paid attention to. Understanding these can avoid detours.
    First of all, it should be pointed out that you should not be impatient, chew slowly, and do not easily take the next step if you do not understand one step. Strive to use each method skillfully. Reading ten or eight books, without much understanding, is not as good as reading one book thoroughly from beginning to end. The so-called thoroughness is not just being able to memorize and calculate, but being able to grasp the basic spirit and basic principles, and being able to use them flexibly. And we must pay attention to its continuity, and learn one book after another according to the depth. For example, when learning mathematics, do not go to algebra and geometry when the basic arithmetic operations have not yet been mastered. Doing so will lead to nothing being accomplished. When learning new and higher-level knowledge, we must take the opportunity to connect it with the old and lower-level knowledge. In other words, if you learn algebra and forget arithmetic, and learn geometry and forget algebra, you will not only forget the previous ones, but also fail to learn the latter ones. In a word, we must recognize the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Learning scientific knowledge is like building a tower, rising level by level, each level built on top of the following levels. Therefore, if one level is not stable, it cannot be built on.
    Secondly, we must frequently check ourselves and not give up any possible opportunity to review. If participating in organized learning, it is best to go through every exam and strive for strict training from the instructors. In the process of national socialist industrialization, living examples are often encountered. Percentages are of course commonplace, and you may as well calculate them when you encounter them. For example, there are often many numbers in the government's published communiqués. If we use them as review materials, we can not only practice calculations, but also increase our specific perceptual understanding of the motherland. Many of the materials provided by Malenkov in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union can be used as mathematical exercises. For example, he said that the index of Soviet industrial output in 1929 was 100, and in 1939 it was 552. This gives us the problem of the average growth rate in these ten years (requires high school level mathematics). From the calculation of the annual growth rate, we can understand the law of proportional increase in the socialist economy. The annual growth rate in the Soviet Union is about 17 percent. This figure shows that socialist society is living a happier life day by day. Therefore, we have obtained a lot of living materials from this report, thus training our calculation skills.
    Third, is the tenacity of learning. When learning science, we must firmly grasp the principle of "advancing despite difficulties." Generally speaking, difficulty depends on the subjective (referring to learning, not research), and depends on the existing training. Having overcome many difficulties, "difficulty" will become "easy." Looking at it with fear, "easy" also becomes "difficult." For example, when learning to play chess, when you first learn, you don't know where to start. After playing thirty or fifty games, you can see one or two steps. Well-trained veteran chess players can see ten or eight steps. If you can see one or two steps when learning scientific knowledge at the middle school knowledge stage, generally speaking, you can complete our learning task! The difficulty is that after our initial learning, when we encounter a problem that requires us to see one or two steps, we will feel helpless and there is no way to go. However, as long as we can persevere and work hard tenaciously, we will suddenly see the light. At that time, we will feel happy, our confidence will greatly increase, and our interest in learning will be even greater!
    Fourth, cultivate interest in the subject being studied. The previous section has already talked about one of the sources of interest in learning. If someone is tutoring, it will be easier. The tutor can choose some vivid and concrete examples in life and in business to help everyone, which can greatly improve the enthusiasm for learning. It is certainly one way to increase interest if the learner can find exercises and practice as proposed in the second point. And the most reliable is the method proposed in the third point, the joy of overcoming difficulties, which is a symphony of confidence and victory. With interest, you will be happy and tireless, so you will also squeeze time to learn.
    Finally, we should talk about the time issue. The enemy of learning is "one day of exposure, ten days of cold," so we must have regular and reliable time. If we can have one hour a day, or five hours a week guaranteed, it will be easier to do well in learning. Factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions can spend some time helping cadres improve their scientific knowledge level, which is an extremely meaningful investment in the cause of the people. Therefore, if leading cadres can appropriately guarantee the time, it can promote learners to achieve results. But on the other hand, every cadre should also recognize the importance and urgency of learning, and try to master their own time as much as possible to complete the learning task. One of the ways to grasp time is to use gaps, especially the use of short periods of time in the gaps. For example, people are often seen reading on the subway in the Soviet Union. This is one of the ways to seize and use time. Don't underestimate this kind of time. If you seize three twenty-minute periods every day, you can learn a lot over time. Keep the learning materials on hand at all times, and open them to read whenever you have time. According to personal experience, this is a good learning method for a busy person.
    IV. Cadres learning scientific knowledge is one of the guarantees for building the motherland.
    Of course, the success of cultural and scientific knowledge learning of cadres in service mainly depends on themselves, but on the other hand, reasonable compilation of teaching materials, proper organization of study classes, and reliable guarantee of time are also closely related. Just in terms of the reasonable compilation of teaching materials, first of all, we must recognize that teaching people with mature thinking is different from teaching primary and secondary school students. The people who compile the teaching materials and those responsible for teaching should pay attention to using the characteristics of adults' mature thinking ability. They should neither mechanically copy a set of ordinary schools, nor should they use a "fast but not successful" blitzkrieg approach, and should also grasp the particularity of each industrial sector to plan teaching materials, such as finding some exercises related to business to increase learners' interest and make them feel particularly cordial and useful. In this way, we can not only strengthen learners' confidence, but also improve learners' enthusiasm. But we must also be careful to prevent the style of arbitrarily deleting teaching materials with great fanfare. If it is really necessary to delete a section, we must also consider it from many aspects, otherwise, when we use it in the future, we will be stretched, which will make learners frustrated and even lose confidence.
    Because the improvement of the scientific knowledge level of workers and peasants is directly related to my country's industrial construction; therefore, whether it is administrative leaders, scientific workers, or housewives, they should all shoulder the responsibility of helping, so that they can concentrate and quickly embark on the learning track and learn scientific knowledge well.
    Finally, please allow me to quote a passage from my visit to the Soviet Union to illustrate that the improvement of the scientific level of workers and peasants is not only necessary, but also a fact that can definitely be successful.
    "In 1920, the Lenin Industrial School accepted a group of new students from workers and peasants. Some professors were unwilling to come to teach these 'uncultured' people, because some of them could not do arithmetic or algebra. But the fact proved that some of them had much better advantages than the 'cultured people' in the city. They had great desires, a high desire for knowledge, and were organized and disciplined. Finally, it was proved that their academic performance was not lower than that of the 'cultured people' in the city. After graduation, they worked as engineers and took on very important work, and in their work they showed even more their efficiency in serving the people. This corrected the erroneous view that people from workers and peasants cannot be trained to become 'talents'."
    After reading this passage, we should no longer have the slightest doubt! These doubts once troubled the professors and made the learners' confidence waver. Science is the product of the accumulation of human social experience. Therefore, it can also be mastered by everyone through learning. Obviously, due to individual differences, the amount of effort required is somewhat different, but if we spend a year and the effect is not great, we will continue for three to five years. With the gradual realization of socialist industrialization, our level will gradually rise like the tide, and in the future will play a greater role in the construction of the motherland.

    谈革命干部学习科学知识问题
    华罗庚
    斯大林教导我们：“要建设，就必须有知识，就必须掌握科学。而要有知识，就必须学习。顽强地、耐心地学习。”诚然，如果我们能照着我们的伟大导师的指示去做，那末，我相信，在三、五年之内，无论是那一个革命干部，都是完全有把握掌握我们工作上所需要的科学知识的。
    一、自修是能达到学习的目的的，毅力和耐心是成功的保证
    自修是学习方法之一。我们可以肯定地说：任何一个人如果养成了自修的习惯，都是终身受用不尽的。但如果因为强调自修而放弃参加集体学习的机会，也是不正确的态度。曾经有些青年干部说：在学校里要学的科目太多，进度很慢，还是在家里自修好一些。这种看法当然是不妥当的。自修只能看作是在正规学习进行中的辅助办法，在无法参加正规学习时候的代替办法。必须知道，在学校（或参加任何学习班）里学习有很多优点：第一，是能够得到系统的、全面发展的为现代公民所需要的常识；第二，是水平高于我们的教师会较快地带我们上路，并且能够及时指出容易被我们忽略的要点和关键所在，又能够帮助我们解释疑难，减少暗中摸索的时间；第三，有检查有考核，易于暴露和及时纠正我们学习中的缺点；第四，和同学在一起，可以互相帮助，互相鼓励。所有这些，都不是用自修的方法能够得到的。但同时也应当培养自修的习惯，这样，一来可以补助学习的不足，二来准备在不能参加学习的时候，能掌握“自修”——这一重要的学习方法。
    自修是一种比较艰苦的学习方法，但它的优点是无论何人、何时、何地都可以采用。只要我们能按步就班，不懈不怠，继之年月，它是可以帮助我们达到科学的光辉的顶点的。凡是具备了普通语文修养的人，就可以运用自修来扩大自己的知识范围。就我所熟悉的数学而言，只要我们肯于自修，便能够使我们进入数学的堂奥。
    但是由于没有督促检查，没有领导指引，自修往往自流，以致有始无终。我个人就有过一些痛苦的经验：由于急躁，想一蹴而成，我常常逾规前进，在最初一个时期看来似乎很有成绩，但一旦运用时却发现运用不灵，而是一个夹生饭。这时，前进不行，回头又不甘心，这种情况几乎使我丧失信心，中途而止。夹生饭重新回锅是件极不愉快的事。我想，一定有不少苦心自修的人有过同样苦痛的经验。因此，无论自修那一门功课，最重要的是避免焦躁，循序前进，才是上策。如果不幸和我有相同的经验，唯一补救办法就是重新从头做起。自修时的另一缺点是往往自以为通，自以为懂，书上的习题会做，书上的定理会背，但若干年后回顾一下，以往所谓的通和懂不过是浮面的、形式上的了解，一遇到原则性的变化就坠入五里雾中，摸不着头脑了。这一缺点，虽然可能是学习过程中极难避免的，但如果自修时能够认真思考，仍可能减轻他的严重性。另一方面也有一些人，对原理、原则谈来似乎了了，但在具体应用时百无一能。此外，虎头蛇尾、有始无终、“一曝十寒”等毛病就不在话下了。
    总之，我觉得，自修能有成绩的主要关键在于毅力和耐心。应当正确地认识为了什么在自修，也应当正确地认识“自修”较“参加正规学习”为坚苦，所需要的时间更多，图快贪多是自修成功的敌人，必须用“涓涓不息，而成江河”的态度，持之有恒，行之有素，才能够完成自修所要达到的目的。
    二、爬山是艰苦的，但开始的一段还是大道
    科学家们经常爱引用马克思在“资本论”法文译本之序与跋里所说的话：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”这是颠扑不破的真理。每一个科学工作者都应当牢记并深刻认识这几句话的意义。但如果用来对学习中学程度的科学知识的人来说，却过早了些。可能因此产生畏难情绪。科学是座大山，愈接近顶点，道路就愈崎岖难行，甚且有很多人迹所没有到过的地区，全靠科学家披荆斩棘地发现道路。但在山脚下，由于多少年来行人的践踏，已经踏成了大道，或者已经修成了拾级可登的阶梯，只要我们不倦地努力，就可以稳步前进。数学中的算术、代数、几何、三角等等在几百年前都是科学上的崎岖小路，而今天已经成为平坦大道了。十四、五岁的少年都能在短时期内掌握它。所以，有了丰富的生活经验和斗争经验的革命干部，在他们成熟的思考能力的帮助下，迅速地掌握这些科目也是毫无问题的，是有绝对的把握的。但成果的丰富与否还要看我们付出代价的多少而定。
    山愈高愈难爬，但由于经过了一段的锻炼，又在这个基础上逐渐丰富了自己的经验，我们是有可能并且一定能够逐步地攀登到高峰的。
    对经验丰富的干部来说：攻克科学堡垒并不比攻克军事堡垒难。科学堡垒是不变的目标，进了一步就进了一步，今天攻不下，还有明天，到了明天，客观形势只会对我们更有利。只要我们一步一步地努力，总是越来越接近胜利。
    三、没有什么秘密的学习方法
    学习科学不能取巧，也没有什么捷径或秘密的快速学习方法。我们决不能在短短的几个月内把六年中学的课程融会贯通，必须认识科学知识学习的长期性和艰苦性。一分努力一分成就，唯有勤恳的耕耘，才能有丰富的收获。但另一方面，如果指导学习的人能够把握住革命干部具有成熟的思考能力这一特点，周密地考虑筹划，那便有可能适当地缩短学习的期限。但决不能缩得太短。所以学习的人务必要首先认识学习的长期性和艰苦性，调匀步伐尽快地前进。如果趁一时之勇，冲锋般地奋勇向前，将来必然会觉得难乎为继。学习科学虽然没有取巧的方法。但确也有一些应当注意的事项，了解了这些，可以少走弯路。
    首先应当提出的是不急不躁，细嚼慢咽，一步不懂不轻易走下一步。每一方法都力求运用熟练。读十本八本，不甚了了，反不如把一本书从头到尾读得精通烂熟。所谓烂熟不只是会背会算，而是能掌握基本精神、基本原理，能够灵活运用。并且必须注意它的连贯性，依照深浅，一本一本地学习下去。例如，在学数学的时候，不要在算术的基本运算还未掌握的时候，就去搞搞代数，摸摸几何。这样做法会陷于一事无成的。学到新的、高一级知识的时候，必须一有机会就联系起旧有的、低一级的知识来。换言之，如果学了代数忘了算术，学了几何忘了代数，这样不但会忘了前面的，而后面的也学不好。一言以蔽之，我们必须认识科学知识的积累性，学习科学知识有如筑塔，级级上升，每一级都建筑在以下诸级之上，因之，一级不稳，就筑不上去。
    其次，必须经常地检查自己，不要放弃任何可能复习的机会。如果参加有组织的学习，最好经过每一个考试，向辅导人员争取严格的训练。在国家的社会主义工业化的过程中，活的例子会经常遇见的。百分比当然是家常便饭，遇见了它不妨算算。比如政府发表的公报中常有许多数字，如果我们把它们用作复习资料，既可以熟练计算，又可以增加对祖国的具体的感性认识。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的报告中所提供的资料，有许多就可以当作数学习题演算。例如：他说苏联工业产量一九二九年的指数是一百，一九三九年是五百五十二。这就给我们提出了这十年内平均增产率的问题（需用高中程度的数学），从每年增产率的计算中，我们可以体会出社会主义经济按比例增加的法则。苏联的增产率每年约百分之十七，这一数字就可以看出：社会主义社会一天比一天生活得更快乐的事实。因此由这一报告中我们就获得了不少活的资料，从而训练了自己的计算本领。
    第三，是学习的顽强性。学习科学时，必须紧紧掌握“知难而进”的原则，一般说来，难易决定于主观（指学习，不指研究），决定于已有的训练。曾经克服过不少困难，则“难”将变为“易”。望而生畏，“易”也变“难”。譬如学下棋，刚学的时候，不知从何下手，下了三、五十盘之后，也就能看出一步两步了。训练有素的老棋手，却能看上十步八步。在中学知识阶段学习科学知识如果能够看上一步两步，一般讲来，就能够完成我们的学习任务了！难的是在我们初学以后，碰到需要能看上一步两步的问题，就会感到束手无策，无路可通。但是，只要我们能坚持地顽强地努力一下，就会豁然开朗的。那时节心怀喜悦，信心大增，学习的兴趣也就更大了！
    第四，培养对所学科目的兴趣。上节已经谈到学习兴趣的来源之一，如果有人辅导这就更容易了。辅导员可以在生活中，在业务中选些生动的、具体的例子，来帮助大家，那就更可以大大地提高学习的热情。学习的人能够如第二点所提出的方法找习题演算，当然也是提高兴趣之一法。而最可靠的是第三点中所提出的方法，克服困难后的乐趣，那是信心和胜利的交响曲。有了兴趣就会乐此不疲，好之不倦，因之也就会挤时间来学习了。
    最后应当谈的是时间问题。学习的敌人是“一曝十寒”，所以我们必须要有经常的可靠的时间。我们每天如果能有一小时，或每周五小时的保证，就易于把学习搞好。厂矿企业机关能为干部们在提高科学知识水平上花一些时间，是对人民事业的极有意义的投资。所以如果领导干部能够在时间方面适当地给予保证，那是可以促使学习者有成绩的。但另一方面，每一个干部自己也应当认识学习的重要性和迫切性，尽可能地掌握好自己的时间来完成学习任务。把握时间的方法之一，是利用间隙，特别是间隙中短暂时间的利用。举例说：在苏联地下车上经常有人在看书，这就是抓紧利用时间的方法之一。不要轻看这样的时间，每天如果抓住了三次二十分钟，日积月累，可以学得不少东西。把学习的材料经常带在手头，一有空便翻开来看，据个人的经验，这对于一个工作繁忙的人，是很好的学习方法。
  四、干部学习科学知识是建设祖国的保证之一
    当然，在职干部的文化科学知识学习的成功与否，主要是依靠自己，但另一方面，如教材的合理编制，学习班的妥善组织，时间的可靠保证，也有着密切的关系。仅就教材的合理编制一点来说，首先必须认识教授思想成熟的人是异于中小学生的，编教材的人和负责教学的人便应当注意利用成人的成熟的思考能力这一特点，既不应当机械地搬用普通学校的一套，也不适宜运用“速而不成”的突击方式，更应当把握每一产业部门的特殊性来计划教材，例如找一些和业务有关的习题，来增加学习者的兴趣，使他们感到特别亲切，格外有用。这样，既可坚定学习者的信心，又可提高学习者的热情。但也须谨防大刀阔斧滥删教材的作风，如果真正需要删掉一节，也必须多方考虑，不然将来运用起来，捉襟见肘，是会使学习者沮丧，乃至丧失信心的。
    由于工农干部科学知识水平的提高是和我国工业建设有着极密切的直接关联的；因此，无论是行政领导，科学工作者，或是家庭妇女都应当担负起襄助的责任，使他们能专心一致地、迅速地走上学习轨道，学好科学知识。
    最后，请让我从访苏笔记上摘录一段话来说明，工农干部科学水平的提高不但是必要的，而且是一定可以成功的事实。
    “一九二○年列宁工业学校接受了一批工农出身的新学生。有些教授不愿意来教这批‘没有文化’的人，因为其中有些人既不会算术，又不会代数。但是事实证明，他们中间有好些人有着比城市‘文化人’好得多的优点。他们有伟大的愿望，有高度的求知欲，并且有组织性和纪律性。最后证明了，他们的学习成绩并不低于城市里的‘文化人’。毕业后他们做工程师，担当很重要的工作，在工作中更显示出他们为人民服务的效率。这纠正了认为工农出身的人不能培养成为‘人材’的错误看法。”
    看了这一段谈话，我们不应当再有丝毫怀疑了！这些怀疑曾经使教授者苦恼，学习者信心不坚定。科学是人类社会经验积累的产物。因之，也是每一个人可以经过学习而掌握的，显然由于各人的差异，费劲的多少有些不同，但如果我们用了一年的时间收效还不大，继之以三年五载，随着社会主义工业化的逐步实现，我们的水平总会水涨船高地逐步上升，将来会对祖国建设起更大的作用的。
