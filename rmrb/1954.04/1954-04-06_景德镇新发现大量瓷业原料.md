　　New Discovery of Large Quantities of Porcelain Raw Materials in Jingdezhen

　　A large quantity of porcelain raw material – kaolin clay – has recently been discovered at Dongshanxia in Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province. After testing by the Industry Bureau of Jingdezhen City People's Government, it has been proven that the quality of this kaolin clay is in no way inferior to the kaolin clay raw materials currently used by various porcelain factories in Jingdezhen City, which come from counties such as Yugan and Xingzi. The deposit of kaolin clay is extremely abundant. It is estimated that if fully exploited, at least 10,000 pieces of kaolin clay could be produced daily, which would not only fully supply the needs of the Jingdezhen porcelain industry, but also greatly reduce the cost of porcelain production due to nearby mining.

　　Currently, relevant authorities have begun building a factory in the new mining area for exploitation. It is expected that soon, a large quantity of porcelain raw materials will be continuously supplied to the nationally renowned Jingdezhen porcelain production.

    景德镇新发现大量瓷业原料
    江西省景德镇市东山下最近发现了大量的瓷业原料——白土矿。经景德镇市人民政府工业局化验证明：这种白土的质量比目前景德镇市各瓷厂采用的余干、星子等县出产的白土原料毫无逊色。白土蕴藏量极为丰富。据估计：如果全部开采，每天至少可出产白土一万余块，不但可以充分供应景德镇市瓷业的需要，而且由于就近开采，将会大大降低瓷业生产的成本。
    目前，有关机关已在新矿区着手建厂，进行开采。预计不久以后，大量的瓷业原料将可源源供应全国闻名的景德镇市瓷业生产的需要。
