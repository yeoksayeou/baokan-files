    Conducting Law and Discipline Propaganda and Education Among Workers and Masses Through Trials of Typical Cases
    Ye Lan
    The experience of establishing specialized courts (tribunals) and specialized procuratorates along the Tianjin railway line and in other industrial and mining areas and along railway lines proves that the in-depth involvement of judicial work in economic departments has a direct and positive effect on protecting economic construction.
    Some people do not understand the significance of establishing specialized courts (tribunals) and specialized procuratorates in economic departments, and even believe that specialized courts are "specifically looking for faults," which will increase the number of workers subject to legal punishment and affect their enthusiasm for production. The reason why these people have this incorrect understanding is that they do not understand the significance of the national legal system; they do not understand the interaction between law and economy, and the direct significance and role of law in guaranteeing the economy.
    Stalin, in explaining that law must actively serve the economic base, said: "Once the superstructure appears, it will become a great active force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its foundation." He also said: "The reason why the base creates the superstructure is to make the superstructure serve it" (Marxism and Problems of Linguistics). Law is the superstructure, and it must serve its economic base. The responsibility of the national judicial organs lies in using legal weapons to fight against all illegal and criminal phenomena, punish crimes, eliminate crimes, educate the broad masses on law-abiding behavior, consolidate the legal system, and guarantee the country's construction. Today, in our industrial, mining, transportation and production enterprises, some accidents that endanger the country's economic construction occur frequently, and some of them seriously damage the national interests. If those who violate regulations, neglect their duties, and cause serious damage to the country are not given the necessary legal sanctions, this phenomenon will be difficult to stop quickly. This phenomenon will bring unimaginable losses to the country. The so-called guarantee and improvement of workers' and masses' sense of responsibility for production undertakings from the legal aspect will become empty talk.
    The state's legal sanctions against crimes have great positive educational significance. Because this is not only a punishment for one person, but also an establishment of the concept of abiding by the law among the masses. Strengthening judicial work in industrial, mining, transportation and production enterprises makes the workers and masses have the idea that "regulations are the law," and they all realize that violating regulations is a legal responsibility. Therefore, strictly abiding by operating procedures and labor discipline will inevitably prevent and reduce crimes. As a result, the number of people subject to legal sanctions will not increase as some people worry, but will definitely become less and less.
    Some people also believe that judicial organs are only used to deal with counter-revolutionaries, and it is not necessary to use them to deal with workers' violations of regulations and labor discipline. Of course, judicial organs must first be a hundred times vigilant and severely deal with the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements, but this does not mean that other criminal acts that endanger the national interests can be ignored. Since the law represents the national interests and is used to protect the national interests, the judicial organs must also solemnly fight against various liability accidents that endanger the national interests in enterprises. Therefore, the idea that employees who cause serious accidents should only be criticized and educated or given administrative sanctions, but should not be prosecuted, is very harmful to the country. In 1921, when the Soviet Union shifted from a state of military tension to peaceful economic construction, it proposed "laying the foundation of a strict revolutionary legal system in all aspects of life, which has become the current task" (Resolution of the 11th All-Russian Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)). During the period of our country's planned economic construction, it is also one of the urgent requirements to correspondingly improve the people's democratic legal system to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction. National plans and enterprise regulations must be strictly observed and must not be violated. Those who violate plans and regulations and cause serious losses as a result cannot but bear legal responsibility. Judging from some accident cases that have occurred in various places, many are of a serious nature and have serious consequences. If the main responsible persons are not given the necessary legal sanctions, it will not be enough to uphold state law and discipline and educate the masses. Of course, the main purpose of legal sanctions is still to educate the masses, so not all those responsible for accident cases should be prosecuted. The main thing is to educate the masses through the trial of typical cases and rely on the masses' consciousness to eliminate accidents. The idea of ​​trying to solve the accident problem solely by means of prosecution is wrong. It is also unnecessary for some people to be hesitant and have concerns because they are afraid of being prosecuted.
    The Tianjin Railway Line Specialized Court conducted public trials of typical accident cases, and the party and government leaders organized workers to discuss the cases, enabling the workers and masses to realize the necessity of strengthening judicial work in enterprises to protect economic construction. They also checked their own thoughts and violations of regulations, and from the ideological point of view, criticized the mistakes of not strictly abiding by regulations and labor discipline, thereby preventing some accidents from happening. This practice of carrying out propaganda and education on abiding by laws and disciplines among workers and masses through the trial and discussion of typical cases is correct and necessary.

### 通过对典型案件的审判在职工群众中开展法纪宣传教育

    通过对典型案件的审判在职工群众中开展法纪宣传教育
    叶澜
    天津铁路沿线和其他工矿区、铁路沿线成立专门法院（庭）和专门检察署的经验，证明了司法工作深入到经济部门中去，对保护经济建设有直接的良好作用。
    有些人不明白在经济部门中建立专门法院
  （庭）和专门检察署的意义，甚至认为：专门法院是“专门找岔子的”，这样会增多职工受法律处分的事件，会影响职工生产的积极性。这些人所以有这种不正确的认识，是因为他们不明白国家法制的意义；不明白法律与经济的交互作用，和法律对于保障经济的直接意义和作用。
    斯大林在解释法律必须为经济基础积极服务时说：“上层建筑一出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固”。又说：“基础之所以创立上层建筑，也就是为了要使上层建筑替它服务”（马克思主义与语言学问题）。法律是上层建筑，它必然要为自己的经济基础服务。国家司法机关的责任，就在于运用法律武器来和一切违法犯罪现象做斗争，惩罚犯罪，消灭犯罪，对广大群众进行守法教育，巩固法制，保障国家的建设。今天，在我们的工矿、交通运输生产企业中，经常发生一些危害国家经济建设的事故，其中有一些是损害国家利益十分严重的。如果对那些违章作业、玩忽职守、给国家造成严重损害的人不给以必要的法律制裁，这种现象是很难迅速制止的。这种现象将带给国家不堪设想的损失。所谓从法律方面来保证和提高职工群众对生产事业的责任心，就会成为空话。
    国家以法律制裁犯罪，具有极大的积极的教育意义。因为这不仅是对一个人的惩罚，而是在群众中树立守法的观念。在工矿、交通运输生产企业中加强司法工作，使职工群众都有了“规章就是法律”的思想，都认识到违章作业负有法律责任，因而严格遵守操作规程和劳动纪律，那就必然会防止和减少犯罪，其结果，受法律制裁的人不是像有些人们所担心的会增多，而是一定越来越少。
    也有人认为：司法机关只是用来对付反革命的，不必要用来处理工人的违章作业、违反劳动纪律这些事。当然，司法机关首先必须百倍警惕地、严厉地对付反革命分子的破坏，但这并不等于说对其他危害国家利益的犯罪行为就可以不管。法律既然是代表着国家利益，并用来保护国家利益的，司法机关也就必须严正地与企业中危害国家利益的各种责任事故进行斗争。因此，认为对发生严重事故的职工只应批评教育或给以行政处分、而不应该法办的思想，就是对国家十分有害的。苏联在一九二一年由军事紧张状态转入和平的经济建设时，曾提出“在生活各方面奠定严格的革命法制的基础，就成为当前的任务”
  （俄国共产党（布）第十一次全俄会议决议）。我国在有计划的经济建设时期，相应地健全人民民主的法制，以保障经济建设的顺利进行，也是当前迫切的要求之一。国家计划和企业的规章，必须被严格遵守，不得破坏，违背计划和规章，并由此而造成严重损失者，是不能不负有法律责任的。根据各处发生的一些事故案件来看，有许多是情节恶劣、后果严重的，如果对主要责任者不给以必要的法律制裁，就不足以严肃国家法纪，教育群众。当然，法律制裁的主要目的仍然是为了教育群众，因此并不是对所有事故案件的责任者都要法办，而主要应是通过典型案件的审判来教育群众，依靠群众的自觉来消灭事故。企图单纯依靠法办来解决事故问题的想法是不对的。有些人因怕法办就缩手缩脚，有所顾虑，也是不必要的。
    天津铁路沿线专门法院对典型事故案件进行公开审判，并由党政领导方面组织职工讨论，使职工群众认识到加强企业中的司法工作以保障经济建设的必要，并联系检查了自己的思想和违章作业行为，从思想上批判了不严格遵守规章和劳动纪律的错误，从而防止了一些事故发生。这样通过典型案件的审判和讨论，在职工群众中开展遵守法纪的宣传教育的作法，是正确的和必要的。
