Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th—The Czechoslovak State Statistical Office issued a communiqué on the 14th regarding the results of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) for the development of the national economy of the Czechoslovak Republic.

The communiqué pointed out: The First Five-Year Plan was fully completed by the end of 1953. This plan, after being approved by the National Assembly at the end of December 1948 for implementation, was revised by the resolution of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in February 1951 and the government decree of April 10 of the same year.

The communiqué stated: During the Five-Year Plan period, Czechoslovakia's industrial production more than doubled, labor productivity increased by 60%, and the proportion of industrial production in the national economy increased from 56% in 1948 to 70% in 1953. The socialist sector of the national economy increased from 61% to 92% (excluding agriculture), and the socialist sector has become the decisive factor in all sectors of the national economy. The total industrial output increased by an average of 15% annually. In 1953, it increased by 102% compared to 1948 and 119% compared to 1937. The amount of industrial products obtained per capita increased by 147% compared to pre-war levels.

The proportion of production means in total industrial output increased from 57.6% to 62.3%. The production of machinery increased 2.3 times, and the machinery industry has become the leading sector among all industrial sectors. Heavy industry related to this has also developed greatly. Steel production increased from 2.3 million tons per year before the war to 4.4 million tons in 1953, coal production increased from 34.7 million tons to 54.7 million tons, and electricity increased from 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours. Compared with 1948, the mining of iron ore increased by 64% in 1953; the mining of manganese ore increased by 1.4 times; the production of steel and steel pipes increased by 73% and 74% respectively; the production of ferroalloys increased by 2.8 times; and the production of the chemical industry increased by 1.5 times. During the Five-Year Plan period, six blast furnaces, nine open-hearth furnaces, eight electric furnaces, two converters, six rolling mills, and two steel pipe rolling workshops were put into production, and twenty-four machine manufacturing plants were also established.

In terms of light industry, during the five years, the production of the textile industry increased by 39%, clothing doubled, leather 19%, glass 21%, porcelain and pottery 28%, and paper 52%. The output of the state-owned food industry also increased by 83% during the Five-Year Plan period.

Czechoslovakia's agriculture has also achieved further development. During the Five-Year Plan period, grain production increased by 5%, oil crops by 79%, potatoes by 30%, sugar beets by 27%, tobacco by 53%, and flax by 154%. Over the past five years, the proportion of cultivated land in unified agricultural cooperatives in the country's cultivated land has increased from 3% to 44%. By the end of 1953, there were 6,679 unified agricultural cooperatives of advanced form in the country, with approximately 262,000 members, and cultivated land accounted for 32% of the country's cultivated land area, approximately one-third. In addition, there were 671 unified agricultural cooperatives of the primary form. During the Five-Year Plan period, more than 14,000 new tractors, nearly 1,175 various combine harvesters, more than 13,500 harvesters, and more than 1,000 trucks were added. The working area carried out by machine tractor stations increased from 753,000 hectares in 1949 to 6.68 million hectares in 1953, an increase of almost eight times. By the end of the last year of the Five-Year Plan, 97% of the country's villages used electricity, and the first television center station was also built.

The communiqué then stated: The railway transportation plan was completed by 105%, the number of buses nearly doubled, and in terms of civil aviation, freight increased 5.3 times and passenger transport doubled.

When talking about the improvement of the people's material welfare and cultural level, the communiqué stated: Czechoslovakia has eliminated unemployment, and the number of workers has increased by one-third. The average wage of employees in various sectors of the national economy increased by 34% in five years, and the average wage of industrial workers increased by 56%. In five years, the working people obtained 131,000 new housing units, and they also built 46,000 housing units themselves. During the five years, seventeen new universities were opened, and the total number of universities in the country now reaches thirty-nine, with a total of 47,000 college students studying there.

The communiqué particularly pointed out that the backward Slovak agricultural area has become an industrial area. During the Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial production in the region has increased by 2.4 times, almost 4.5 times that of 1937.

The communiqué also pointed out that the production of fuel and electricity cannot meet the growing needs of the national economy, and that agricultural development lags behind industrial development.

The communiqué concluded: The outstanding achievements of the First Five-Year Plan have opened up a bright and splendid prospect for the further development of Czechoslovakia's national economy and the improvement of the people's living standards.
