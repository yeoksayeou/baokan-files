Southern Shaanxi Province has begun picking spring tea, and it is expected that production will increase by 15% to 20% compared to last year. The Ankang branch of the China Tea Company has established twenty-nine purchasing stations in tea-producing areas and has begun large-scale purchases.

The tea-producing area in southern Shaanxi Province includes ten counties such as Ziyang, Langao, Ankang, and Zhenba. The area is characterized by rolling hills and a mild climate, making it the only tea-producing region in the Northwest. The green tea produced here is of good color and taste, known as "Ziyang Tea," and is a popular beverage among the people of all ethnic groups in the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Shaanxi. After liberation, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government actively supported tea farmers' production, and last year's tea production reached more than 2 million jin, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output (1936) by 83%.

    陕西省南部春茶丰收
    陕西省南部春茶已开始采摘，预计可比去年增产一成半到二成。中国茶业公司安康支公司设立在产茶区的二十九个收购站，已开秤大量收购。
    陕西省南部产茶区包括紫阳、岚皋、安康、镇巴等十县，境内丘陵起伏，气候温和，为西北区唯一产茶区域。所产绿茶，色味都好，号称“紫阳茶”，向为甘肃、宁夏、青海、陕西四省各民族人民喜爱的饮料。解放后，陕西省人民政府积极扶助产茶区农民生产，去年茶叶产量已达到二百多万斤，超过战前最高年产量（一九三六年）百分之八十三。（新华社）
