    Thanks for the Concern and Support of the People Nationwide
    Guarantee the Completion of the Han River Railway Bridge Construction Task
    Comrade Editor: We are the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army participating in the Han River Railway Bridge project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. When we heard the news that the people nationwide were organizing a delegation to慰问 (offer comfort and appreciation to) the People's Liberation Army, every comrade felt very excited and honored. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would unite with the workers to complete the Han River Railway Bridge ahead of schedule in order to thank Chairman Mao and the people nationwide for their kind concern and慰问 (comfort and appreciation).
    All our commanders and fighters have displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism and work enthusiasm, working day and night on the Han River Railway Bridge construction project. Scaffolders spend all day climbing on bridge frames more than thirty meters high to connect piles. Divers dive into the water eight or nine meters deep time and time again to explore piles and blast. Second-Class Merit Citation recipient Zhang Chuanmu and Youth League member Wang Guangquan and other comrades, when digging a three-meter wide and deep earth cage, water started gushing out when they were only half a meter deep. In less than half an hour, the water had risen to the surface. In order not to affect the progress of the work, they jumped into the waist-deep ice water without hesitation, enduring the biting cold of winter, and worked for four hours, completing the task ahead of schedule. Communist Party member Dong Guanghe, who had received a Third-Class Merit Citation, was lying in the mud, curling his legs, and facing the sky, working in the rain so heavy that he could barely open his eyes, for four hours when he was doing the work of assembling pile drivers, and finally completed the task. During the Spring Festival, in order to build the bridge pier foundation out of the water before the flood, the comrades automatically proposed the slogan "Turn Holidays into Voluntary Labor Days"; many comrades had been away from home for many years, and the superiors had originally approved their home leave, but for the great construction of the motherland, they all voluntarily requested not to go home.
    All these achievements in our work are inseparable from the encouragement and support of the people nationwide. We have never forgotten what Chairman Mao taught us: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a fighting force and also a working force. In the struggle to realize the Party's general line during the transition period, we must unite with the people nationwide, carry forward the spirit of heroism and hard struggle, and actively dedicate all our strength to the construction cause of the motherland.

      Building Tibet, Consolidating National Defense
    Comrade Editor: Although we are in Lhasa, the remote border of the motherland, we are constantly thinking of the people nationwide and Chairman Mao.
    In our task of advancing into Tibet, the people nationwide supported us with the greatest strength, transporting the best cars and construction equipment to us; transporting high-quality leather shoes, leather hats, and leather clothes; and transporting rice, flour, meat, and easy-to-carry canned food and substitute food powder. The Tibetan people also organized a large number of yak transportation teams to help with the supply of materials for the front-line troops. This meticulous care and active support became a huge source of encouragement for us to overcome all difficulties.
    Here on this remote border, we are constantly concerned about the great economic construction of the motherland. The completion of the Huai River project, the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the commencement of production at the seamless steel pipe plant, large-scale steel rolling plant, and No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, etc., have made us more aware of the great responsibility of defending the border of the motherland and building a new Tibet. Every one of our comrades understands that our work is closely linked to the construction of the motherland. In the future, we must build Tibet as beautiful as the mainland of the motherland.
    Now the people nationwide have organized a慰问 (comfort and appreciation) delegation to慰问 (comfort and appreciation) us, which makes us deeply feel the glory of being a revolutionary soldier and the importance of the responsibility. In the future, we must dedicate greater efforts to consolidating national defense, uniting the Tibetan people, and building a new Tibet.

    Vigilantly Guarding the Motherland's Coastal Defense
    Comrade Editor: We soldiers guarding the motherland's coastline welcomed our relatives - the National People's慰问 (comfort and appreciation) Delegation to慰问 (comfort and appreciation) the People's Liberation Army - with extremely warm feelings. The delegates came to us despite their hard work, bringing the kind concern of the people nationwide and Chairman Mao. Like Zhao Fengxia, an actress from the Jinzhou Pingju Opera Troupe, who was about to give birth, still resolutely participated in the慰问 (comfort and appreciation) performance, performing the most popular "Tea Bottle Scheme" for our troops. The delegates held meetings and heart-to-heart talks with us, holding our hands and asking about our lives and studies as if mothers were seeing their children.... All this made us deeply feel the meticulous care and love of the people of the motherland for us, and the supreme glory of being a people's soldier.
    The delegates gave us reports on the Party's general line during the transition period and introduced the heroic deeds of model workers in industry and agriculture. These reports educated us, raised our socialist consciousness, and strengthened our determination to defend the motherland. We are determined to work hard to learn the advanced military science of the Soviet Union, heighten our vigilance, defend the coast, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland!

    感谢全国人民的关怀和支援
    保证完成修建汉水铁桥的任务
    编辑同志：我们是参加武汉长江大桥汉水铁桥工程的中国人民解放军铁道兵。当我们听到全国人民组织慰问人民解放军代表团的消息时，每个同志都感到非常兴奋和光荣。大家一致表示，要和工人们团结在一起，提前修好汉水铁桥，来答谢毛主席和全国人民对我们亲切的关怀和慰问。
    我们全体指战员都发挥了高度的革命英雄主义精神和工作积极性，夜以继日地进行着汉水铁桥的修建工程。架子工们整天爬在三十多公尺高的桥架上接桩。潜水员们一次又一次地潜入八、九公尺深的水下探桩和爆破。二等功臣张传穆与青年团员王光全等同志在挖一个宽、深三公尺的地笼时，才挖到半公尺深，地笼里就开始向外冒水，不到半小时水已冒出地面，为了不影响工作的进展，他们毫不犹豫地跳进没腰深的冰水中，忍受着严冬刺骨的寒冷，工作了四小时，提前完成了任务。曾立过三等功的共产党员董光和这次做组成打桩架的工作时，因为受地形限制，就躺在泥水里，蜷曲着腿，面朝着天，在大雨淋得连眼睛都睁不开的情况下坚持了四个小时，终于完成了任务。在春节期间，为了在洪水未来之前把桥墩基础筑出水面，同志们自动提出了“把假日变成义务劳动日”的口号；很多同志离家多年，上级本来批准他们回家探亲，但为了祖国的伟大建设，他们都自动要求不回家。
    我们工作中的所有这些成绩，是与全国人民对我们的鼓励和支援分不开的。我们一刻也没有忘记毛主席所教导我们的，中国人民解放军是一个战斗队，同时也是一个工作队。在实现党在过渡时期总路线的斗争中，我们一定和全国人民团结一致，发扬英勇的、艰苦奋斗的精神，积极为祖国的建设事业而献出全部力量。

      建设西藏，巩固国防
    编辑同志：我们虽然在祖国遥远的边疆——拉萨，但是却时刻地在怀念着全国人民，怀念着毛主席。
    在我们执行进军西藏的任务中，全国人民曾以最大的力量来支援我们，给我们运来了最好的汽车和修建器材；运来了质量很好的皮鞋、皮帽和皮衣；并且运来了大米、白面、肉类和便于携带的罐头、代食粉。藏族人民更组织了大批犛牛运输队，帮助了前方部队的物资供应。这种无微不至的关怀和积极的支援，成为我们克服一切困难的巨大鼓舞力量。
    我们在这遥远的边疆，时刻地关怀着祖国的伟大经济建设。治淮工程的完成，成渝铁路的通车以及鞍钢无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉开工生产等消息传到西藏后，使我们更加认识到守卫祖国的边疆与建设新西藏的重大责任。我们每个同志都懂得，我们的工作和祖国的建设是紧紧联系着的。将来我们一定要把西藏建设得和祖国内地一样的美好。
    现在全国人民组织了慰问团对我们进行慰问，使我们深刻地感到作为一个革命军人的光荣和责任的重大，我们今后一定要为巩固国防，团结藏族人民建设新西藏而献出更大的力量。

    警惕地守卫着祖国的海防
    编辑同志：我们守卫在祖国海防线上的战士，以极其热烈的心情欢迎了我们的亲人——全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团。代表们不辞辛苦地到我们这里，带来了全国人民和毛主席对我们的亲切关怀。像锦州市评剧团的演员赵凤霞，不久就要生孩子了，仍坚决地参加慰问演出，给我们部队演出了最受欢迎的“茶瓶计”。代表们和我们一起开会谈心，像妈妈见了孩子们似的拉着我们的手问长问短，问我们生活、学习情形……。这一切，使我们深深地感觉到祖国人民对我们无微不至的关怀和热爱，以及作为一个人民战士的无尚光荣。
    代表们给我们做了党在过渡时期总路线的报告，介绍了工农业劳动模范的英雄事迹。这些报告教育我们提高了社会主义的觉悟，增强了保卫祖国的决心。我们决心努力学习苏联的先进军事科学，提高警惕，保卫海防，保卫祖国的社会主义建设！
