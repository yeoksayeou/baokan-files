Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: TASS, Moscow: On March 31st, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Joxe, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Hayter, and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Bohlen, and handed them identical notes from the Soviet government to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The full text of the Soviet government's note to the French government is as follows:

The Soviet government considers it necessary to draw the attention of the French government to the following matters:

The Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peace and improvement of international relations in the past and at present. This is manifested in the fact that the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed in the United Nations that all countries generally reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

The solution to the problem of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other most dangerous weapons of mass destruction would greatly alleviate the heavy burden imposed on the people of all countries by the continued expansion of armaments, and eliminate the danger of using the great scientific discovery of atomic energy for destructive purposes. The solution of this problem is of the utmost importance for consolidating peace and the security of the people of all countries.

It is known that, due to numerous obstacles, no corresponding international agreement has yet been reached on the above-mentioned important issue. However, despite this, the importance of the efforts of all countries, especially the major powers which bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace, to reach such an agreement is not diminished. As for the Soviet Union, it will continue to firmly advocate that the armaments and armed forces of all countries must be substantially reduced, and that agreements aimed at ensuring that atomic energy is not used for destruction and mass slaughter of mankind must be reached. Such efforts by all countries are becoming increasingly important, especially as the destructive power of atomic weapons continues to increase, and in addition, hydrogen weapons, which are many times more powerful than atomic weapons, have emerged. There is no doubt that if atomic and hydrogen weapons are used in war, they will bring endless disasters to the people of all countries, massively kill peaceful residents, and destroy many large cities—many modern industrial, cultural, and scientific centers, including some historically long-standing and civilized cities such as the largest capitals of the world.

The Soviet government is making due efforts to promote the possibility of reaching an agreement on the above-mentioned important issues, also based on the following consideration: there are still other unutilized opportunities to consolidate peace.

To this end, it is first necessary to point out the significance of consolidating European security, because maintaining peace in Europe is of decisive significance for maintaining world peace and preventing new wars.

In view of this, the Soviet government submitted the proposal of "Ensuring European Security" for review at the Berlin Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and for this purpose, it put forward a draft of the basic principles of the "All-European Treaty on Ensuring European Collective Security." The draft treaty stipulates that an all-European collective security system should be established on the basis of the collective efforts of European countries. All European countries, including Germany, regardless of their social systems, can participate in this treaty, and before Germany is unified, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany may be members of the treaty. The treaty stipulates that if any contracting party is subjected to armed attack, assistance should be provided to the attacked country by all possible means, including the use of armed forces, in order to restore and maintain international peace and European security.

It can be seen from this that the purpose of the draft of the basic principles of the All-European Treaty is to establish an effective European collective security system in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

The establishment of an all-European collective security system can prevent the establishment of military blocs of several mutually hostile countries in Europe. If such blocs are established, it will inevitably sharpen relations between countries, inevitably increase hostility and mistrust between them, not to mention that the establishment of such military blocs will inevitably be accompanied by the expansion of armaments, and as a result, the people of all countries will suffer all the evils arising therefrom. At the same time, it should be taken into account that the establishment of military blocs by a group of countries will inevitably lead another group of countries to take countermeasures to ensure their security. In this way, a situation will be formed in which relations between countries are not based on common cooperation for the sake of maintaining peace, but on the opposition between one group of countries and another. As a result, the tense relations between countries will inevitably be further aggravated, thereby deepening the threat of a new war. Speaking of this, one cannot fail to remember that both the First World War and the Second World War were preceded by the establishment of mutually opposed military blocs by several countries, and Europe was divided into two hostile camps. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that German militarism played a particularly dangerous role in these military blocs, and in the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars. It can be seen from this how important it is to replace the policy of establishing military blocs of several mutually opposed countries with a policy of effective cooperation among all European countries in the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace. Such cooperation among all European countries, large and small, regardless of their social systems, can avoid Europe's periodic plunge into destructive wars, as evidenced by the historical experience of European countries over the past century.

It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government has repeatedly urged the French, as well as the British and American governments, to pay attention to the dangers caused by the establishment of military blocs by some countries. In particular, the Soviet government has urged attention to the danger that the plan to establish the so-called "European Defense Community" leads to the revival of German militarism and thereby poses various dangerous consequences for the cause of peace in Europe, especially for the security of West Germany's neighbors. Everyone knows that the plan to establish the "European Defense Community" stipulates the establishment of an exclusive military bloc of six European countries, and under the guise of this bloc, the so-called "European Army" is composed of the armies of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. The main role in this "European Army" is played by the West German army led by Hitler's generals, which violates the obligations undertaken by France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union not to allow the revival of German militarism, and at present, some people are planning to establish dozens of West German divisions. Everyone also understands very well that due to the plan to establish the "European Army," the West German ruling group has openly accelerated the re-militarization of West Germany as their goal, implemented measures to establish various regular armies, and believes that it is no longer necessary to conceal their intention to invade neighboring countries. Therefore, the peace-loving people of European countries, especially West Germany's neighbors, are faced with the threat of the revival of German militarism and West Germany's accession to the "European Defense Community," and cannot but express due concern for their own security. Taking the road of reviving German militarism and establishing European military blocs not only does not help consolidate peace, but paves the way for a new war. Therefore, now more than ever, peace-loving countries, especially the major powers, need to make efforts to prevent a new war and ensure that the people of European countries, including the German people, are not dragged into a new war, because in the current situation, a new war is particularly dangerous to the people. If all European countries work together to establish a European security system to replace the military blocs of mutually opposed European countries, then this problem can be solved smoothly. At the same time, the establishment of such a European collective security system is in line with the interests of consolidating universal peace. It is precisely for this reason that the idea of European collective security, especially after the Berlin Conference, has gained the active support of many countries and the support of broad international public opinion. Differences arose during the Berlin Conference's discussion of the Soviet proposal to conclude an All-European Treaty, so a unanimously agreed decision was not reached. However, the Soviet government, in view of the importance of reaching an agreement on this important issue, believes that it is appropriate to continue to study this proposal. In the discussion of the Soviet proposal on ensuring European collective security, some people believed that it was inappropriate for the United States to be excluded from the European collective security treaty. In view of this situation, the Soviet government, taking into account that the United States participated in the common struggle against Hitler's aggression during the Second World War, taking into account that the United States, together with the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom, bears responsibility for the settlement of post-war European issues, and taking into account the views expressed by the US government at the Berlin Conference, believes that there is no obstacle to supporting the United States' participation in the "All-European Treaty on Ensuring European Collective Security." In this way, what has been considered a difficulty in reaching an agreement on the establishment of a European collective security system until now should no longer exist. When the Berlin Conference discussed the Soviet proposal on the All-European Treaty, it also touched on the question of the status and role of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" after the establishment of the European collective security system. The representatives of France, Britain, and the United States asserted that the North Atlantic Treaty is defensive and is not directed against any country or countries. Official representatives of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom also made such remarks when commenting on the Soviet proposal on establishing an all-European collective security system after the Berlin Conference. The Soviet government's position on the North Atlantic Treaty is well known. The Soviet government disagreed in the past and cannot agree now with the view that the treaty is defensive in nature. In this regard, the Soviet government's starting point is that the North Atlantic Treaty establishes an exclusive group of certain countries, it ignores the task of preventing the resurgence of German aggression, and since only the Soviet Union among the major powers that participated in the anti-Hitler alliance has not participated in the North Atlantic Treaty, it cannot but be considered an aggressive treaty aimed at the Soviet Union. It is very clear that only when all the major powers that participated in the anti-Hitler alliance have joined the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" can the organization eliminate its aggressive nature under the corresponding conditions. Based on this, the Soviet government, in accordance with the principles of its consistent peaceful foreign policy and the desire to ease international tensions, specifically expresses its willingness to study the question of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty together with the countries concerned. Since the French government, as well as the British and American governments, have declared their willingness to ease international tensions and consolidate peace, it is hoped that they will agree to take measures to ensure that the North Atlantic Treaty has a truly defensive nature and create conditions to eliminate the possibility of a certain part of Germany being dragged into a military bloc. In this case, the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" will no longer be a narrow military bloc of certain countries, but will become an organization in which other European countries can participate, which will not only establish an effective European collective security system, but also be of great importance for consolidating universal peace.

The Soviet government believes that the various problems arising therefrom can be resolved in a manner satisfactory to all relevant countries and in line with the consolidation of peace and the security of the people of all countries.

The Soviet government simultaneously sent the same note to the British and American governments.

    就普遍裁军、巩固欧洲安全等问题
    苏联照会法英美三国政府
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫在三月三十一日接见法国驻苏大使约克斯先生、英国驻苏大使海特尔先生、美国驻苏大使波伦先生，把苏联政府致法国、英国、美国政府的内容相同的照会交给他们。
    苏联政府致法国政府照会的全文如下：
    苏联政府认为有必要促请法国政府注意以下事项：
    苏联政府过去和现在始终不渝地执行和平与改善国际关系的政策。这表现为，苏联政府在联合国中曾多次提议各国普遍裁减军备，禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    普遍裁减军备以及禁止原子武器及其他最危险的大规模毁灭性武器的问题得以解决，就可以大大减轻继续不断的扩张军备给各国人民造成的沉重负担，消除将原子能的使用方法这样一种伟大的科学发现用于破坏目的的危险。这个问题的解决对巩固和平与各国人民的安全具有最重要的意义。
    大家知道，由于重重的阻难，直到现在还没有能就上述重要问题达成相应的国际协议。然而，尽管如此，各国首先是对维护国际和平负有特别责任的各大国努力争取达成这种协议的重要性，并不因此就减小了。至于苏联，它今后仍然坚主必须大量裁减各国的军备和武装部队，并达成旨在保证不将原子能用来破坏和大规模屠杀人类的协议。各国这种努力越来越是重要，这特别是由于原子武器的破坏力量不断加大，此外还出现了威力比原子武器大许多倍的氢武器。毫无疑问，如果在战争中使用原子武器和氢武器，就会替各国人民带来无穷的灾难，大规模地杀死和平居民，破坏许多大城市——许多现代工业、文化、科学的中心，包括像世界各国最大的首都那样一些历史悠久的文明城市。
    苏联政府之所以作应有的努力以促进就上述重要问题达成协议的可能，还由于这样一点出发：目前尚存在着另外一些尚未利用的巩固和平的机会。
    为此，首先必须指出巩固欧洲安全问题的意义，因为维护欧洲和平对维护世界和平及防止新战争具有决定性的意义。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府在法英美苏四国外长柏林会议上提出了“保障欧洲安全”的建议交付会议审查，并为此提出了“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”基本原则草案。条约草案规定在欧洲各国集体努力的基础上建立全欧集体安全体系。欧洲一切国家，包括德国在内，不问其社会制度如何，都可以参加这个条约，而且在德国没有统一以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国均得为条约的成员国。条约规定，一旦任一缔约国受到武装进攻，应以一切可能的办法，包括采用武装力量，援助受进攻的国家，以便恢复和维持国际和平及欧洲安全。
    由此可见，全欧条约基本原则草案的目的在于根据联合国宪章的原则建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系。
    建立全欧集体安全体系，就可以制止在欧洲建立互相敌对的若干国家的军事集团。如果建立这种集团，则势必使国与国之间的关系尖锐化，势必使它们之间更加敌视和不信任，更不用说建立这种军事集团，必然伴随着要扩充军备，结果各国人民遭受由此产生的一切恶果。同时应该考虑到的是，一批国家建立军事集团，必然使另一批国家为了保障其安全，也采取对策。这样，就会形成这种局面：国与国之间的关系不是建立在为了维护和平而共同合作的基础上，而是建立在一批国家和另一批国家对立的基础上。结果，不可避免地使国与国之间的紧张关系更加恶化，从而也就加深新战争威胁。谈到这里，不能不记取的是：不论是第一次世界大战还是第二次世界大战，战争爆发以前若干国家都曾建立互相对立的军事集团，欧洲曾分裂为两个敌对的阵营。同时不能忘记：德国军国主义曾在这些军事集团里，曾在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战的爆发中起过特别危险的作用。由此可见，以欧洲一切国家在维持和巩固和平的事业中进行有效合作的政策来代替建立互相对立的若干国家的军事集团的政策，是何等重要。所有欧洲大小国家，不论其社会制度如何，它们之间的这种合作可以避免使欧洲周期性地陷入破坏性的战争，欧洲各国一世纪来的历史经验就证明了这一点。
    正因为如此，苏联政府曾多次促请法国以及英国和美国政府注意建立一些国家的军事集团所引起的危险性。特别是，苏联政府曾促请注意这种危险：建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划导致德国军国主义的复活，并由此对欧洲和平事业，尤其是对西德邻国的安全造成各种危险的后果。大家知道，建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划规定建立六个欧洲国家的排他的军事集团，并在这个集团的幌子下，由法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡及西德的军队组成所谓“欧洲军”。在这个“欧洲军”中起主要作用的是由希特勒的将领率领的西德军队，这一点是违反法国、英国、美国和苏联所承担的、关于不让德国军国主义复活的义务的，而且目前有人正策划建立数十个西德师。大家也都很明白，由于建立“欧洲军”的计划，西德统治集团已经公开作为他们的目的来加速进行西德的重新军国主义化，实现建立各种正规军的措施，并认为已经没有必要掩饰自己侵略邻国的企图了。因此，欧洲各国、特别是西德邻国爱好和平的人民面临着德国军国主义复活和西德加入“欧洲防务集团”的威胁，不能不对自己的安全表示应有的担忧。走复活德国军国主义和建立欧洲军事集团的道路，这不仅无助于巩固和平，反而为新战争铺平道路。因此，现在比过去任何时候都需要爱好和平的国家，首先是各大国努力来防止新战争，保证欧洲各国人民，包括德国人民在内，不被拖进新战争，因为在目前情况下，新战争对人民特别危险。如果所有的欧洲国家共同努力来建立欧洲安全体系，以代替互相对立的欧洲国家的军事集团，那末这一问题就能顺利解决。同时，建立这样的欧洲集体安全体系，是符合巩固普遍和平的利益的。正因为如此，欧洲集体安全的主张，特别是在柏林会议以后，已经获得许多国家的积极支持，获得广泛国际舆论的支持。柏林会议讨论苏联关于缔结全欧条约的建议时发生了分歧以致没有达成一致同意的决定。但是，苏联政府鉴于就这一重要问题达成协议的重要，认为继续研究这个建议是合宜的。在讨论苏联关于保障欧洲集体安全的过程中，有人认为美国被排在欧洲集体安全条约之外是不合宜的。苏联政府鉴于这种情况，考虑到美国在第二次世界大战期间参加过反对希特勒侵略的共同斗争，考虑到美国和苏联、法国、英国一起对战后欧洲问题的解决负有责任，同时考虑到美国政府在柏林会议上所表示的观点，认为赞成美国参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”并没有什么障碍。这样，一直到现在被认为是就建立欧洲集体安全体系问题达成协议的困难就该不存在了。柏林会议在讨论苏联关于全欧条约的建议时，还涉及了一个问题：欧洲集体安全体系建立后，“北大西洋公约组织”的地位和作用如何？法国、英国和美国代表断言，北大西洋公约是防御性的，它并不是为了对付某个国家或某些国家。法国、美国、英国的官方代表在柏林会议后评述苏联关于建立全欧集体安全体系的建议时，还发表这类言论。苏联政府对北大西洋公约所采取的立场大家是很清楚的。苏联政府过去不同意、而且现在也不能同意这样一种意见，即该公约具有防御性质。在这方面，苏联政府的出发点是：北大西洋公约建立一个某些国家的排他的集团，它忽视防止德国侵略再起这一任务，并且由于在参加反希特勒联盟的大国中，只有苏联没有参加北大西洋公约，因此不能不认为这个公约是一个矛头指向苏联的侵略性的条约。十分明显，只有当所有参加过反希特勒联盟的大国都参加了“北大西洋公约组织”的时候，该组织才能在相应的条件下消除其侵略性质。苏联政府根据这一点，本着它的一贯不变的和平外交政策的原则和缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，特表示准备和有关国家共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题。既然法国政府，还有英国和美国政府，宣布愿意缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平，那么就可望它们同意采取措施来保证这样一种情况，使北大西洋公约具有真正防御的性质，并创造条件来消除德国某一部分被拉入军事集团的可能。在这种情况下，“北大西洋公约组织”就不会再是一个某些国家的狭隘的军事集团了，而会成为欧洲其他国家都可参加的组织，这样不但能建立一个有效的欧洲集体安全体系，而且对巩固普遍和平，也具有极其重要的意义。
    苏联政府认为，由此而产生的种种问题可以得到为一切有关国家所满意的、并符合巩固和平与各国人民的安全的解决。
    苏联政府同时送给英国和美国政府与此内容相同的照会。
