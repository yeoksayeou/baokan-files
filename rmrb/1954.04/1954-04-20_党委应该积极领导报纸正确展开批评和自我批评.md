Four years have passed since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on展开ing Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" on April 19, 1950. Over the past four years, local party committees and their official newspapers have made certain efforts in implementing this decision of the Party Central Committee. In particular, during the anti-corruption and anti-waste struggle of 1952 and the anti-bureaucracy and anti-commandism struggle of 1953, criticism and self-criticism in newspapers were significantly strengthened. This not only exposed and criticized some typical bad people and bad deeds in a particularly prominent way but also greatly attracted the broad masses of the people to supervise our various tasks and put forward tens of thousands of useful criticisms and suggestions, greatly enhancing the political enthusiasm of the masses. However, in general, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is still not strong enough, and the criticism in newspapers is still not sufficient. Some cadres still lack the "revolutionary attitude of warm welcome and resolute protection" specifically required in the Central Committee's decision towards criticism, especially criticism from below.

We should understand that criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for promoting our various tasks. In our daily work, correct and incorrect things, new and growing things, and old and dying things are constantly engaged in fierce struggle. Correct and newborn things demand continuous development, while wrong and old dying things are always playing a hindering and destructive role. This struggle is extremely widespread, existing in every region, every department, and every task, and is carried out every day and every hour. If we want continuous improvement in the work of our various regions, it is not only necessary for our cadres at all levels to constantly review and criticize the wrong, old, and dying aspects of our work, but also to attract the broad masses of the people to supervise our work with millions of eyes and extremely rich wisdom through newspapers, to put forward timely criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings and errors in our work, to supervise us and help us overcome shortcomings and correct errors in this struggle, so that our work can truly improve with each passing day and strive for perfection. Only under the supervision of the broad masses can all shortcomings and errors be discovered and overcome in a timely manner. Any cadre, no matter how high his position or how great his merits, if he does not have this selfless supervision and public criticism from the broad masses of the people, he will lose vigilance and become negligent in his work, and some will become even more arrogant. Pride will drag them backward, causing them to lose their enthusiasm and noble qualities of serving the people diligently and conscientiously, and degenerate into the mire of bourgeois despicable individualism. Precisely for this reason, we regard this criticism and self-criticism, especially public criticism from below, as the driving force for our work to move forward continuously, like air and water, as something that everyone needs every day.

However, not all party committees and newspaper staff understand this principle. Therefore, in the past four years, most party committees and newspapers have not fundamentally implemented this decision of the Central Committee well, but have fundamentally implemented it poorly. Newspapers should first bear an important responsibility in this regard.

The common shortcomings and errors shown by most party committees' official newspapers in implementing this decision of the Central Committee are that criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers are not widespread, not sufficient, and not frequent. Our newspapers pay more attention to the exposure and criticism of typical bad people and bad deeds, which is naturally important, but this cannot be regarded as the most important or the only thing. Because it is not only those units and cadres who have made serious mistakes who need to improve their work and need criticism; but also those units and cadres who have not made serious mistakes do not need to improve their work and do not need criticism. Our criticism is to remind all parties to pay attention to their shortcomings and errors in time, so that these shortcomings and errors can be corrected when they are still in the bud, rather than waiting until they have developed to a very serious point before criticizing them. In the past, what the newspapers in various places exposed and criticized were mostly those who should be severely punished, and these should be criticized. However, limiting the targets of criticism to these has created a harmful impression among the broad masses and cadres, thinking that anyone who receives public criticism in the newspaper has made a serious mistake and is "finished once it is published"; thinking that the newspaper should not publicly criticize general shortcomings and errors, but only criticize serious shortcomings and errors; thinking that the shortcomings and errors of good people cannot be publicly criticized, but only bad people and bad deeds can be criticized. This greatly narrows and weakens the role of criticism and self-criticism, which is an extremely harmful distortion and misunderstanding of criticism and self-criticism. In the future, newspapers should use concrete facts to eliminate this harmful impression created by themselves, not only should they criticize serious errors and educate cadres and improve work through systematic criticism of typical events; but also should conduct timely criticism of various noteworthy shortcomings and errors in the daily work of all parties, sound the alarm everywhere, sound the alarm at all times, and form a regular atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party.

For typical bad people and bad deeds, not only should criticism be carried out, but also a merciless struggle should be carried out, and a severe blow should be given in order to eliminate such bad people and bad deeds in our country. However, these bad people and bad deeds do not exist in any place at any time, but have great particularity, and we must also adopt this special attitude and means to treat them. As for the general nature of shortcomings and errors in our work, they exist in any place, any department, and any time. For these ordinary shortcomings and errors, we should adopt comrade-style criticism and self-criticism so that everyone can unite and eliminate these shortcomings and errors, and prevent these general shortcomings and errors from developing into serious errors, and this is needed in any place, any department, and any time. The task of the newspaper is not only to criticize and struggle against the former kind of bad people and bad deeds, but more importantly and more frequently to criticize and self-criticize the latter kind of general shortcomings and errors in the work.

Another common shortcoming and error committed by most newspapers in implementing the Central Committee's decision is that they have not adopted a very serious attitude towards this solemn task entrusted to them by the Party, and have not achieved complete correctness in criticism, including complete correctness in the facts being criticized and complete correctness in the attitude adopted during criticism. There is an erroneous idea among the newspaper staff, thinking that criticism in the newspaper cannot be completely true, but can only be basically correct. Naturally, we cannot demand complete truthfulness from the criticism manuscripts sent by the broad masses of the people. At the same time, for the criticized, even if the criticism is only 5% correct, it should be welcomed. However, when the newspaper wants to publish these criticisms, it must conduct in-depth and meticulous investigation and verification in advance, and only after the investigation is completely accurate and the words used are completely correct can it be published. Because the criticism published in the newspaper is not the personal criticism of the author, but the criticism on behalf of the Party, it is a just and powerful force of public opinion, and it cannot be untrue and incorrect. Moreover, the criticism in the newspaper is for the benefit of practical work, not for criticism for the sake of criticism. Therefore, when dealing with a criticism manuscript, it is also necessary to analyze which are the shortcomings that cannot be overcome temporarily under the current actual situation, and which are the shortcomings that can be overcome but have not been overcome. All criticisms of shortcomings cannot be uniformly labeled with big hats such as "serious bureaucracy" without analysis. Newspapers should not exaggerate facts or make arbitrary judgments about any shortcomings and errors.

Newspaper staff should always maintain a very clear and calm mind. It should be recognized that it is very dangerous to publish criticism manuscripts without strict investigation and consideration. Because the petty-bourgeois attitude of extremism, one-sidedness, subjectivism, and the sloppy and frivolous style can easily affect us, therefore, the responsible cadres of the newspaper should not only constantly educate editors, reporters, and the broad masses of correspondents with the principle that "news must be completely true," but also should strictly correct any phenomenon of untrue reporting. At the same time, we must be a hundred times more vigilant against enemies and bad elements deliberately using criticism as a cover to carry out rumors, slander, sow discord, and frame-up plots, and we must always be good at distinguishing correct criticism from destructive criticism, and use serious and meticulous investigation and research work to prevent enemies from taking advantage of loopholes.

In order to make the criticism in the newspaper frequently and correctly carried out, the newspaper editorial department, under the leadership of the Party committee, must have a serious and responsible spirit of independent responsibility. The newspaper is entrusted by the Party committee to carry out criticism, and it should naturally give play to its initiative and enthusiasm, so that it can truly become a strong assistant to the Party committee. On the one hand, the newspaper editorial department is not allowed to make independence from the Party committee at the same level; on the other hand, it should not passively rely on the Party committee in everything. The responsible cadres of the newspaper should not only verify the facts, analyze the reasons with great seriousness and prudence when conducting criticism, but also repeatedly think calmly according to the Party's policies; when they are not sure, they must not be self-righteous and act arbitrarily, and should take the initiative to ask the Party committee for instructions at any time, and strictly follow the intentions of the Party committee. This attitude of actively asking the Party committee for instructions at any time is fundamentally different from the attitude of being afraid of taking responsibility and relying on the Party committee in everything. This is necessary for the newspaper to actively, proactively, and correctly carry out criticism. If the newspaper makes mistakes in the process of criticism, it certainly cannot stop criticizing because of this, but should make more efforts to correctly and actively carry out criticism. If there are some mistakes in conducting criticism and therefore do not criticize, that is one mistake after another, and it is adding the most serious mistake - liberalism. This kind of liberalism will condone all kinds of serious mistakes, so it is absolutely not allowed.

In the process of implementing the Central Committee's decision on展開ing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, in addition to the problems in the implementation of the newspaper, it must also be pointed out that the newspaper's criticism has encountered great obstacles. As pointed out by the Fourth Plenary Session, there is a fairly serious proud mood of not welcoming criticism and a fairly serious liberal style of giving up criticism in our Party. A considerable number of cadres are developing an extremely dangerous proud mood. They are overwhelmed by the achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and self-criticism spirit that communists must have. They can only listen to flattery and praise, but cannot accept criticism and supervision. They suppress and retaliate against critics, and dominate the areas or departments they administer. Another part of the cadres believe that only by adopting an attitude of "concealing evil and promoting good" towards these proud and complacent people can they be considered "caring" for the cadres or "respecting" the leaders, and that publicly criticizing them in the newspapers will hurt their dignity and weaken their prestige. This blocks or suffocates the criticism in the newspapers, condones the development of proud emotions and individualism.

If the Party committee does not lead and help its official newspaper to carry out the struggle and resolutely implement the Central Committee's decision against this kind of thinking and behavior that violates the Central Committee's decision, hinders newspaper criticism, and even suppresses newspaper criticism, that is very wrong. We have seen that in many local party committees, there is an extremely harmful attitude towards the criticism carried out by their official newspapers. That is, when the newspaper does not criticize the shortcomings and errors of all parties, the Party committee often does not remind or blame the newspaper; but when the newspaper makes mistakes in the process of criticism, the Party committee does not adopt the attitude of correcting mistakes and encouraging them to continue criticizing, but loses its temper and scolds its official newspaper. When the newspaper's criticism is hindered, the Party committee rarely provides the necessary support and protection. When the newspaper is criticized or hindered and becomes passive again, the Party committee resumes the attitude of not reminding or blaming. Is it not very reasonable for people to infer from this liberal disease of the newspaper that the Party committee is also suffering from the liberal disease?

The reason why some party committees do not lead the newspaper to carry out criticism is that they are afraid that the newspaper will cause trouble by展开ing criticism. Of course, the purpose of展開ing criticism in the newspaper is to do a good job, and it should not cause trouble. But precisely because they are afraid that the newspaper will cause trouble by展开ing criticism, the Party committee should strengthen its leadership over its official newspaper and constantly guide its official newspaper to correctly carry out criticism, so that its official newspaper can be tempered from specific work and improve its ability to independently conduct correct criticism. If the leading cadres of the newspaper are indeed too poor in standard and too bad in style, the Party committee should immediately replace them. It should be understood that entrusting a group of unreliable people to preside over the Party's official newspaper and letting them criticize indiscriminately is naturally dereliction of duty; it is also dereliction of duty to entrust a group of unreliable people to run a newspaper that does not carry out criticism.

For four years, many party committees' official newspapers have not implemented the Central Committee's decision well and have not carried out criticism well in the newspapers, which is naturally a manifestation of the weak party spirit of the editorial department. The Party committee's failure to correct this serious shortcoming in time, which is of a principled nature, is also a manifestation of the weak party spirit. It shows that this Party committee has not actively led the展开ment of criticism and self-criticism inside and outside the Party in this area. The shortcomings of the newspaper in展开ing criticism are the shortcomings of the Party committee. On the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the Central Committee's "Decision on展开ing Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," party committees in various places should, in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, conduct an inspection of the situation of展開ing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and immediately take effective measures to improve criticism and self-criticism in newspapers.

### 党委应该积极领导报纸正确展开批评和自我批评

    党委应该积极领导报纸正确展开批评和自我批评
    一九五○年四月十九日，中共中央发布了“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，到现在已四年了。四年来各地党委和党委的机关报在执行党中央这一决定中作了一定的努力，特别是在一九五二年的反贪污浪费斗争和一九五三年的反官僚主义命令主义斗争当中，报纸上的批评和自我批评曾显著地加强，这不只是特别突出地揭发和批判了一些典型的坏人坏事，而且大大吸引了广大人民群众来监督我们的各项工作，提出数以万计的有益的批评和建议，大大提高了群众的政治积极性。但是，总的说来，批评和自我批评的空气还是很不浓厚，报纸上的批评还是很不充分；一部分干部对待批评特别是自下而上的批评，还缺乏如中央决定中所特别要求的那种“热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度”。
    我们应该理解：批评和自我批评是推动我们各项工作的动力。在我们日常的各项工作中，正确的和错误的、新的生长着的和旧的死亡着的事物，随时都在进行着尖锐的斗争。正确的和新生的事物要求不断地发展，错误的和旧的死亡着的事物总是在起阻碍作用和破坏作用。这种斗争极为广泛，在每一个地区、每一个部门、每一项工作中都存在着，而且每天每时都在进行着。我们各个地区各项工作如果要得到不断改进，就不只是要求我们各级干部经常检讨和批评我们各项工作中所存在的错误的、旧的、死亡着的方面，而且还需要通过报纸吸引广大人民群众用千百万双眼睛和极为丰富的智慧来监督我们的工作，对我们工作中的缺点和错误提出及时的批评和建议，监督我们和帮助我们在这个斗争中克服缺点，纠正错误，使我们的工作真正能够日新月异，精益求精。只有在广大人民众目睽睽的监督下，一切缺点和错误才有可能及时地被发现和克服。任何干部，不管他的职位多高，功劳多大，如果没有广大人民群众这种铁面无私的监督和公开的批评，他们就会失去警惕，在工作中疏忽起来，有些人则更会骄傲起来，而骄傲就会把他们拖着向后倒退，以致于使他们失去热情和勤勤恳恳为人民服务的高贵品质，堕落到资产阶级的卑鄙的个人主义泥坑中去。正因为这样，我们才把这种推动我们工作不断向前的批评和自我批评、特别是把自下而上的公开批评当成空气和水一样，成为我们每一个人每一天都不能缺少的东西。
    但是，这种道理并不是一切党委和报纸的工作人员都懂得。因而在这四年来，多数党委和报纸对于中央这一决定，不是基本上执行得好，而是基本上执行得不好。报纸在这方面应该首先担负重要的责任。
    多数党委的机关报在贯彻中央这一决定时所表现出来的带普遍性的缺点和错误，就是在报纸上的批评和自我批评不广泛、不充分、不经常。我们的报纸比较注重典型的坏人坏事的揭发和批评，这自然是重要的，但这不能被看成是最主要的或唯一的。因为并不是只有那种犯有严重错误的单位和干部才需要改进工作，才需要批评；而那种没有犯严重错误的单位和干部就不需要改进工作，就不需要批评。我们的批评是为了及时提醒各方面注意自己的缺点和错误，使这些缺点和错误还在萌芽的时候就得到纠正，而不是一定要等它发展到十分严重的时候才去批评。过去各地报纸所揭发和批评的，大都是应该受到严厉处分的，这些是应该批评的。但是把批评的对象限制于这些，就在广大群众和干部中造成一种有害的印象，以为凡是受到报纸公开批评就是犯了严重错误，“一登报就完蛋了”；以为报纸不应该公开批评一般性的缺点和错误，只能批评严重的缺点和错误；以为好人的缺点和错误不能公开批评，只能批评坏人坏事。这就大大地缩小了和削弱了批评和自我批评的作用，这是对批评和自我批评的一种极为有害的歪曲和误解。报纸在今后应该用具体的事实来消除自己所造下的这种有害的印象，不只是应该批评那些严重的错误，通过一些对典型事件的系统批判来教育干部和改进工作；而且还应该对各方面日常工作中的各种值得注意的缺点和错误进行及时的批评，处处敲警钟，时时敲警钟，在党内党外形成一种经常性的批评和自我批评空气。
    对于典型的坏人坏事，不只是应该进行批评，而且要进行无情的斗争，给以严重的打击，以便在我们的国家中消灭这种坏人坏事。但这种坏人坏事并不是在任何地方任何时候都有的，而是有很大的特殊性的，我们也必须采用这种特殊的态度和手段来对待它。至于我们工作中一般性质的缺点和错误，则是在任何地方、任何部门、任何时候都有的，对于这些普通性质的缺点和错误，我们就应该采取同志式的批评和自我批评，以便大家团结起来，消除这些缺点和错误，不使这些一般的缺点和错误发展成为严重的错误，而这是在任何地方、任何部门、任何时候都需要的。报纸的任务不只是对于前一种坏人坏事应该进行批评和斗争，而更重要更经常的是对于后一种一般性质的工作中的缺点和错误进行批评和自我批评。
    多数报纸在贯彻中央决定时所犯的带普遍性的另一个缺点和错误，就是对待党所委托给自己的这一庄严的任务，没有采取十分严肃的态度，没有作到批评的完全正确，包括所批评的事实的完全正确，和批评时所采取的态度的完全正确。在报纸工作干部中有一种错误的思想，认为报纸上的批评不可能作到完全真实，只能是基本上正确的。自然，我们对广大人民群众寄来的批评稿件是不能要求完全真实的，同时，对被批评者来说，那怕批评只有百分之五的正确性，也应该欢迎。但是当报纸要把这些批评登载出来，就必须事先进行深入细致的调查核对，只有调查完全确实了并且所用的词句完全正确了以后才能刊登出来。因为刊登在报纸上的批评，不是作者个人的批评，而是代表党的批评，它是公正的强大的社会舆论力量，是不能不真实而正确的。而且，报纸上的批评是为了有利于实际工作，并不是为批评而批评，因而在处理一个批评稿件的时候，还要分析那些是在目前实际情况下暂时还不可能克服的缺点、那些是可以克服而没有克服的缺点，不能对一切缺点的批评都不加分析地一律戴上“严重的官僚主义”之类的大帽子。报纸不应对任何缺点和错误夸大事实、乱下断语。
    报纸工作人员应该经常保持十分清醒冷静的头脑。应该认识到不经过严格的调查和斟酌就发表批评稿件是十分危险的。因为小资产阶级对待问题的那种偏激的片面的主观主义的态度和马虎潦草的轻浮作风很容易影响我们，因此报纸的负责干部不只是应该经常以“新闻必须完全真实”的道理来教育编辑记者和广大的通讯员，而且应该严格纠正任何报道的不真实现象。同时，我们更不能不百倍地警惕敌人和坏分子故意利用批评作掩护，来进行造谣中伤、挑拨离间、打击陷害等阴谋诡计，而要经常善于区别正确的批评和破坏性的批评，并用严肃细致的调查研究工作来防止敌人钻空子。
    要使报纸上的批评经常地正确地开展，报纸编辑部在党委的领导下，必须有严肃认真的独立负责精神。报纸受党委的委托来进行批评，自然应该发挥主动性和积极性，使自己真正成为党委的有力助手。报纸编辑部一方面不许向同级党委闹独立性，另一方面也不应该消极地事事依赖党委。报纸的负责干部在进行批评时不只是应该十分严肃慎重地核对事实、分析原因，而且应该冷静地按照党的政策来反复思考；在自己没有把握时，千万不要自以为是、自作主张，应该随时主动地去向党委请示，严格按照党委的意图办事。这种随时主动向党委请示的态度，和那种处处怕负责，一切依靠党委的态度，是根本不相同的。这是为了使报纸能够积极地主动地正确展开批评所必需的。报纸在进行批评中犯了错误，当然不能因此就不批评，而是应该更加努力正确地积极地展开批评。进行批评中有了一些错误，因而不批评，那就是一错再错，而且是加上了一个最为严重的错误——自由主义。这种自由主义将会纵容各种各样的严重的错误，因此是绝对不能容许的。
    在贯彻中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定的过程中，除了报纸方面执行有毛病以外，还必须指出报纸的批评是遇到很大的阻碍的。这正如四中全会所指出的，在我们党内存在着相当严重的不欢迎批评的骄傲情绪和相当严重的放弃批评的自由主义作风。相当多的一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，就忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，在自己所管辖的地区或工作部门称王称霸。另有一部分干部又认为只有对这种骄傲自满的人采取“隐恶扬善”的态度，才算“爱护”干部或者才算“尊敬”领导，而在报纸上对他们进行公开的批评就会伤害他们的尊严，削弱他们的威信。这就阻塞了或者扼杀了报纸上的批评，纵容了骄傲情绪和个人主义的发展。
    对于这种违反中央决定、阻碍报纸批评甚至压制报纸批评的思想和行为，党委如果没有领导和帮助自己的机关报去进行斗争，去坚决贯彻中央的决定，那是非常不对的。我们看到，在不少地方党委中，对待自己机关报所进行的批评，存在着一种极为有害的态度，就是当报纸对待各方面的缺点和错误不做批评的时候，党委对报纸常常是不提醒、不指责的；但是当报纸在进行批评中出了毛病的时候，党委不是采取纠正错误、鼓励他们继续批评的态度，而是对自己的机关报大发脾气、斥责一通。当报纸的批评受到阻碍的时候，党委很少给以应有的支持和保护。当报纸受到了指责或阻碍又消极下来的时候，党委又重新采取不提醒、不指责的态度。人们可以从报纸的这种自由主义病症，推断出党委同样害了自由主义病症，难道不是很合理的吗？
    有的党委之所以不领导报纸展开批评，是怕报纸展开批评会出乱子。当然在报纸上展开批评是为了搞好工作，是不应该出乱子的。但是正因为怕报纸在展开批评上出乱子，党委就更应该加强对自己机关报的领导，经常指导自己的机关报正确地展开批评，让自己的机关报从具体的工作中得到锻炼，提高他们独立进行正确批评的能力。如果报纸的领导干部确是水准太差，作风太坏的，党委就应该立即撤换他们。应该了解：委托一批不可靠的人去主持党的机关报、让他们去胡乱批评，自然是失职行为；就是委托一批不可靠的人去办一个不进行批评的报纸，也是失职的行为。
    四年以来，不少党委的机关报没有很好执行中央决定，没有在报纸上很好地开展批评，自然是编辑部党性不强的表现，而党委没有及时纠正这种带原则性的严重缺点，也就是党性不强的表现。它表明这一党委并未积极领导这一地区在党内外开展批评和自我批评。报纸在展开批评方面的缺点，就是党委的缺点。在中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”发布四周年的时候，各地党委应当本着四中全会决议的精神，对于在报纸上展开批评和自我批评的情况进行一次检查，并立即采取有效的办法，改进报纸上的批评和自我批评。
