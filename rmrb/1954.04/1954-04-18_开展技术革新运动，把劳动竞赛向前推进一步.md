The formation of technical innovation as a mass movement in Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) began after Zhang Mingshan, a production innovator at the small rolling mill, successfully created the "anti-collar" device in September 1952. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, acting on instructions from the Party Central Committee, repeatedly educated all employees with Zhang Mingshan's pioneering spirit and the small mill's experience, pointing out that this was the direction for transforming old enterprises, and called on all employees of the company to learn from the small mill and follow its path. In 1953, five city-wide technical innovation award conferences and two large-scale technical innovation exhibitions were held, with over 60,000 people organized to visit, truly forming a magnificent mass technical innovation movement. Following Zhang Mingshan and the small mill, outstanding technical innovators such as Wang Chonglun, Li Genyuan, Huang Demao, and Liu Zuwei, as well as advanced technical innovation units such as the steel wire rope factory, the tool workshop of the machinery general factory, the power plant, and the capital construction carpentry shop, emerged successively.

In total, over the past year or so, 17,032 employees of Angang have submitted 38,688 rationalization proposals, of which 22,047 have been adopted and 13,105 have been put into production. Among these, 1,956 can be calculated to have created value, which can create wealth for the country worth 367.327 billion yuan annually.

As a result of the mass technical innovation movement, Angang completed 113.55% of the state plan in 1953, 105.1% of the increased production and economization plan, and 114.4% of the labor productivity plan, an increase of 24% compared to 1952. The successful creation of each new technology not only increased output and quality, reduced costs, and improved labor productivity, but also freed workers from high-temperature operations, reduced physical labor, and ensured safe production and the health of workers. The phenomenon of emphasizing physical labor in past competitions has since changed, pushing labor emulation forward and beginning to become regularized.

The technical innovation movement is an inevitable undertaking for the liberated working class to realize the country's socialist industrialization.

After liberation, Angang's employees, through a series of emulation movements and political movements such as plant protection, material dedication, new record creation, resisting America and aiding Korea, and increasing production and practicing economy, greatly improved their class consciousness and patriotic sense of responsibility, playing a decisive role in the construction of Angang. However, in labor emulation, relying solely on labor enthusiasm and simply increasing labor intensity is far from enough, and can cause adverse consequences, such as a surge in accidents during rush work, an increase in reject rates, more injured and sick workers, and a decrease in attendance rates. In this situation where production problems cannot be solved by simply relying on increased physical labor, the attention of the masses will inevitably turn to technical innovation, and labor emulation will gradually develop in the direction of technical innovation.

Our enterprise is an old enterprise taken over from the enemy, characterized by backward technology, outdated equipment, uneven production, and extremely harsh working conditions. After production is restored, in order to further unleash the enterprise's potential, improve labor productivity, improve working conditions, and ensure safe production and the health of workers, it is necessary to adopt new technologies and transform the production equipment of the old enterprise. Therefore, it is natural for technical innovation to form a mass movement.

With the improvement of enterprise management level, starting from the requirement of completing the state plan evenly, weak links will be constantly discovered in the enterprise's production, which will inevitably require mobilizing the masses to innovate technology and improve equipment, gradually breaking through the weak links, and continuously improving labor productivity. After the small mill implemented the new rolling method of rough rolling, in order to catch up with the backward processes and seek new equilibrium, the equipment of each backward process was gradually improved, the "anti-collar" device was created, the heating furnace was improved, and automatic steel pushing machines, automatic steel turning machines, and automatic material conveying machines were created, greatly increasing the degree of mechanization and automation of the entire work. The creation of automatic winding machines, automatic cutting machines, meter counters, parking devices, etc. at the steel wire rope factory were also gradually created successfully in order to seek new equilibrium in production and better complete the state plan.

Regarding how to carry out the technical innovation movement and further advance labor emulation, we have the following experiences:

1.  It is necessary to establish the idea of relying on the working class and fully support the creative wisdom of the working class. Leading cadres must go deep into the production process, understand the key issues in production technology, and guide employees to use their creative wisdom to solve these problems. We must support the suggestions of employees in all aspects, such as eliminating employees' ideological concerns; paying attention to overcoming the idea of working alone; organizing forces to help research, supplement, and revise, and encouraging the emotions of creators in all aspects. After the suggestion is affirmed, it should be incorporated into the technical measures plan, and attention should be paid to supervising and inspecting, seizing the production, and putting it into production in time. During production and testing, necessary time, manpower, and material assistance should be given, and when necessary, appropriate time should also be given to be detached from production to specialize in testing. Workers who operate and test must maintain their average wage income for the previous three months, and after the test is successful, honorary and material rewards must be given in a timely manner. After a certain technical creation is successfully put into production, the part of the workers who are increased due to the improvement of production efficiency must be properly arranged. In the whole process from the proposal to the realization, various incorrect technical ideas must be criticized, and new sprouts must be vigorously supported, constantly making them grow and consolidate. For example, the company organized forces to help the thin plate factory make double lifting platforms, asked Soviet experts to help solve the "anti-collar" device for rolling small-sized steel at the small mill, helped cultivate and summarize the experience of Wang Chonglun's workshop, organized technical innovation award conferences and exhibitions, etc., all of which are specific supports. The technical innovation movement in Angang was launched only after the leadership overcame the problems of bureaucracy and vigorously supported the creation of employees.

2.  It is necessary to give play to the organizational role of the rationalization proposal committee, establish a normal working order, implement the policy of combining labor experience with scientific and technological knowledge, organize mass technical research groups, and give play to the creative spirit of collectivism. When the movement continues to deepen and the enthusiasm of employees' collective creation is greatly improved, it is urgent to improve the organization of the rationalization proposal committee, so as not to let conservative ideas and bureaucracy hinder the creative wisdom of employees. In the movement, the trade unions of various factories selected old workers with creative talents and technical personnel with advanced ideas to participate in the work of the rationalization proposal committee, or organized them into a prestigious technical leadership core. According to the requirements of completing the plan and the principle of balanced production, they put forward topics based on the key issues in production, and widely mobilized employees to put forward rationalization proposals. A system of registration, review, approval, assistance in research, drawing, and making technical appraisals has been established. Some factories also absorb the proposers to participate in the discussion, and when there are differences of opinion that cannot be resolved, they submit them to the technical leadership core to organize special research, or ask Soviet experts to make the final decision. In the rationalization proposal committee and the technical research group, technical personnel with scientific and technological knowledge, old technical workers with rich practical production experience, and skilled workers with operating experience should be absorbed, so as to closely combine labor experience and scientific and technological knowledge, the production experience of repair workers and the operating experience of direct production workers, everyone learns from each other's strengths and weaknesses, gives play to the collective strength, enriches and supplements the original proposals, solves various difficulties, and unifies technical understanding. 80% of the old workers in the steel wire rope factory participated in the technical research group, adopting the approach of one person proposing and everyone studying, so that the proposals can be realized quickly, overcoming the phenomenon of backlog of rationalization proposals, and making rationalization proposals truly become a mass movement.

3.  The technical innovation movement has promoted the improvement of enterprise management, and the improvement of enterprise management level has ensured the normal progress of the technical innovation movement. Because the technical innovation movement follows the principle of balanced production, solves weak links, and strengthens the balance of production; or breaks through the main production processes, breaks the existing production balance, and strives to achieve a higher production level. The development and changes of balanced production and the improvement of production level are determined by the use of new machinery, new tools, and the adoption of new operating methods and new technologies, so technical innovation is the most vivid content of strengthening plan management. And the adoption of any new technology will inevitably lead to a series of management problems. Such as training workers to master new technologies, formulating new operating procedures, revising technical norms, formulating technical measures plans according to the new imbalance, formulating advanced production plans based on the adoption of new technologies, organizing the supply of raw materials, properly arranging the surplus labor force, and creating a large number of new creations, etc., all of which must improve the enterprise management work to adapt to it. For example, after a large number of rationalization proposals appeared among the workers of the steel wire rope factory, the leadership strengthened the leadership of the repair section, gave play to the potential of the repair section, and incorporated the production of innovative technologies into the monthly and quarterly plans of the repair section, and constructed according to the progress. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 1953, in addition to completing the daily tasks, the repair section also produced 99 new machines. In addition, due to the proposal of innovator Li Genyuan, mutual assistance and cooperation between the steel wire rope factory and the metal products factory was organized. Both factories needed the die-casting machine created by Li Genyuan. The steel wire rope factory did not have casting equipment, and the metal products factory did not have drawings and lathes. As a result, the two factories cooperated to produce four units, and each factory received two units. Because of the timely production, the continuous development of the technical innovation movement was ensured. For another example, one of the key issues of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1954 is how to improve the output and quality of the primary rolling mill to meet the needs of each rolling mill for steel billets. With the help and guidance of the company, the primary rolling mill formulated the technical measures plan for the whole year of 1954, proposing to realize 40 topics and 19 expert suggestions. At the production technology representative meeting of the whole factory, everyone proposed 80 topics, which were discussed and decided to be included in the technical measures plan for the whole year. If these topics and expert suggestions can be realized, the country can increase production by more than 300 billion yuan throughout the year, while the investment only needs more than 20 billion yuan. This approach clearly pointed out the direction of efforts for all employees of the factory. In this way, from the company to the factory and mine, the innovation movement was promoted in a more organized and led manner.

4.  Humbly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and resolutely implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts are important conditions for carrying out the technical innovation movement. Many major creations, improvements, and advanced operating methods in the movement were successful only with the personal participation of Soviet experts in research, the supply of various technical reference books, and enthusiastic guidance. Some factories and mines do not have Soviet experts, but they can also learn advanced Soviet experience from books. In the work of learning from the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, there must be a tenacious and indomitable spirit, overcoming various difficulties and ideological obstacles, especially the resistance of Anglo-American technical ideas. After learning from the Soviet Union or implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is successful, the entire employees should be repeatedly educated with these vivid facts. At the same time, a certain system should be established. Such as reporting to experts, registering expert suggestions, announcing expert suggestions, checking the implementation in time; assigning advanced technical personnel to be expert assistants, establishing specialized organizations or setting up full-time personnel to study and implement expert suggestions; inviting experts to make reports, organizing employees to learn Russian, and giving certain rewards to those who have excellent results in learning from the Soviet Union and implementing expert suggestions, so that learning from the Soviet Union and implementing expert suggestions become a mass movement with leadership and organization.

5.  We must conduct in-depth ideological education, improve the class consciousness of employees, and overcome various ideological obstacles. The entire technical innovation movement process is a process of improving equipment and improving technical level, and it is also a process of advanced ideas overcoming backward ideas. In the movement, it is necessary to continuously carry out education on the general line to all employees, and pay attention to enlightening and cultivating the advanced ideas of old workers and technical personnel in various different types of work, and educating all employees with real people and real things. In the technical innovation movement, there are roughly the following ideological situations: Old technical workers are very familiar with the performance of existing equipment and have rich operating experience. 90% of the creations that have been successful in the entire movement have come from the hands of old workers. However, these old workers often retain the influence they have received in the old society, love face, are afraid of not being successful and "losing face", and want to "show off" and only want to work alone. Among individual old technical workers, there is also conservative thinking, believing that creation is superfluous and a waste of effort. After Zhang Mingshan successfully created the "anti-collar" device, some of the technical personnel personally saw the creative wisdom of the workers and gained a further understanding in this regard. After the technical innovation movement was launched, they were also willing to combine with the workers to create together, but there was still some distance in their thinking, especially when they encountered suggestions from workers that they had not learned in books, they did not dare to intervene, fearing that they would lose their status as technical personnel if they failed. Another part of the technical personnel are ambitious and like to design a huge device themselves based on books, but they are unwilling to study with the workers. Skilled workers often have conservative thinking of sticking to the old ways, believing that "they have been operating for many years, and that is how they have done it." After the technical innovation improves the equipment, the operating methods must be fundamentally changed. They are afraid of trouble and dislike it, and even fear that it will affect their piece-rate wages during the test. For these thoughts of workers and technical personnel, we must patiently persuade and educate them, improve their awareness, so that they consciously and actively give play to their creative wisdom, and make them move from individual work to collective creation. The units where the movement is carried out well are due to the fact that the leadership has conducted in-depth investigations into the thinking of employees and continuously improved the ideological understanding of employees, so that the movement has continued to move forward. For example, when engineer Zhou Renyuan of the small mill put forward the suggestion of the "anti-collar" device, he believed that it had not been successfully tested in countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and Germany, and Zhang Mingshan's suggestion was also afraid of not being successful. With the continuous help of the leadership and the continuous improvement of ideological understanding, after the "anti-collar" test was successful, he took the initiative to make a review and actively studied and tested with the workers, and personally participated in the creation of the rough-rolling southern steel turning machine. For another example, the steel wire rope factory learned in the movement that after the old worker Li Genyuan successfully created the winding machine, he believed that he should "leave a voice when the wild goose flies over, and leave a name when people pass by," fearing that if one thing was not successful in the future, he would lose face, so he asked to transfer his work. The factory director and the general branch secretary immediately talked to Li Genyuan to help him establish the idea of being the master of the country, and at the same time helped him solve various difficulties in his life and creative work. After the help of the leadership, Li Genyuan's understanding improved, and he made a guarantee to the leadership: "I must change this old vision, and I will dedicate all my technology to the country." Then he successively created five mechanical equipment. This vividly shows that only after incorrect ideas are defeated can the movement have a solid ideological foundation, and can the movement continue to move forward with a strong guarantee.

The above-mentioned work is only the experience gained by some factories and mines. There are still many factories and mines that have not achieved this level, and there are still many problems. These all need us to work hard to solve and continue to improve in the future.

    开展技术革新运动，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步
    鞍山市工会联合会
    鞍钢的技术革新形成为群众性的运动，是在一九五二年九月小型轧钢厂生产革新者张明山创造反围盘成功以后开始的。中共鞍山市委根据党中央的指示，以张明山的首创精神和小型厂的经验，反复地教育全体职工，指出这是改造旧企业的方向，号召全公司职工向小型厂学习，走小型厂的道路。在一九五三年一年中先后举行了五次全市性的技术革新奖励大会，两次规模较大的技术革新展览会，组织了六万多人参观，真正形成了壮阔的群众性的技术革新运动。继张明山和小型厂之后，又陆续出现了王崇伦、栗根源、黄德茂、刘祖威等突出的技术革新者，及钢绳厂、机械总厂工具车间、发电厂和基本建设木工场等先进的技术革新单位。
    总计一年多以来，鞍钢职工有一万七千零三十二人提出合理化建议共三万八千六百八十八件，已采纳者二万二千零四十七件，已投入生产者一万三千一百零五件，其中可以计算出创造价值者有一千九百五十六件，全年可给国家创造三千六百七十三亿二千七百万元的财富。
    群众性技术革新运动的结果，一九五三年鞍钢完成了国家计划百分之一百一十三点五五，完成增产节约计划百分之一百零五点一，劳动生产率计划完成百分之一百一十四点四，比一九五二年提高了百分之二十四。每一件新技术创造的成功，不仅提高了产量和质量，降低了成本，提高了劳动生产率，而且使工人摆脱了高温作业，减轻了体力劳动，保证了安全生产和工人的身体健康，过去竞赛中偏重加强体力劳动的现象从此改变，使劳动竞赛推进了一步，开始走向经常化。
    技术革新运动是解放了的工人阶级为实现国家社会主义工业化所必然要进行的。
    解放后，鞍钢全体职工经过护厂、献交器材、创造新纪录、抗美援朝、增产节约等一系列的竞赛运动和政治运动，阶级觉悟和爱国主义的责任感大大提高，发挥了高度的劳动热情，在建设鞍钢的工作中起了决定性的作用。但是，在劳动竞赛中，只凭劳动热情和单纯加强劳动强度是非常不够的，并且会造成不良的后果，如突击竞赛使得事故增多，废品率提高，伤病员增加，出勤率降低等等。在这种单纯依靠加强体力劳动不能解决生产问题的情况下，群众的注意力必然会转向技术革新方面，劳动竞赛必然会逐步地向技术革新的方向发展。
    我们的企业是从敌人手中接过来的旧企业，它的特点是技术落后，设备陈旧，生产不均衡，劳动环境极端恶劣。当生产恢复之后，为了进一步发挥企业的潜在力量，提高劳动生产率，改善劳动环境，保证安全生产和工人身体健康，就必须采用新技术，改造旧企业的生产设备。因此技术革新能够形成群众性的运动是很自然的事情。
    随着企业管理水平的提高，从均衡地完成国家计划的要求出发，企业的生产上会不断发现薄弱环节，这也必然要求发动群众革新技术，改进设备，逐步突破薄弱环节，使劳动生产率不断提高。小型厂实行毛轧的新轧钢法后，为了使落后的工序赶上，求得新的均衡，便逐步改进了各落后工序的设备，创造了反围盘，改进了加热炉，创造了自动推钢机、自动翻钢机和自动运料机等，使整个工作的机械化自动化程度大大提高。钢绳厂的自动卷线机、自动切断机、米数表、停车器等的创造，也都是为了求得生产上新的均衡，更好地完成国家计划而逐步创造成功的。
    对于如何开展技术革新运动，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、必须树立依靠工人阶级的思想，全力支持工人阶级的创造智慧。领导干部必须深入生产过程，摸清生产技术上的关键问题，引导职工发挥创造智慧来解决这些问题。要从各方面支持职工的建议，如要解除职工思想上的顾虑；注意克服单干的思想；组织力量帮助研究、补充、修改并从各方面鼓舞创造者的情绪。建议肯定后，要订入技术措施计划，并注意督促检查，抓紧制作，及时进行试验和投入生产。在制作和试验时要给以必要的时间、人力和材料的帮助，必要时还应给以适当的时间脱离生产专门从事试验，试用时不要因为怕耽误生产而不给试验机会（当然也不能盲目试验，必须有领导有组织地进行）。操作试用的工人必须保持其本人前三个月平均工资的收入，试验成功后必须及时给以名誉的和物质的奖励。某项技术创造成功正式投入生产后，因提高生产效率而多出的一部分工人，必须妥善地安置。从建议提出到实现的整个过程里，必须对各种错误的技术思想进行批判，要大力扶育新生的萌芽，不断使它成长和巩固。如公司组织力量帮助薄板厂制作双升降台，请苏联专家帮助解决小型厂轧小规格钢材的反围盘，帮助培养和总结王崇伦车间的经验，组织技术革新奖励大会和展览会等等，都是具体的支持。鞍钢的技术革新运动，就是领导上克服了官僚主义的毛病，大力支持了职工的创造后才开展起来的。
    二、要发挥合理化建议委员会的组织作用，建立正常的工作秩序，贯彻劳动经验与科学技术知识相结合的方针，组织群众性的技术研究小组，发挥集体主义的创造精神。当运动继续深入，职工集体创造的积极性大大提高时，就迫切要求健全合理化建议委员会的组织，不让保守思想和官僚主义阻碍职工的创造智慧。在运动中，各厂工人都选出了有创造才能的老工人和有先进思想的技术人员参加合理化建议委员会的工作，或组织成有威信的技术领导核心，按照完成计划的要求和均衡生产的原则，根据生产上的关键问题提出课题，广泛发动职工提合理化建议。并建立了登记、审查、批准、协助研究、绘图、作出技术鉴定等制度。有的厂在讨论时并吸收建议人参加，遇有意见分歧不能解决时，就提交技术领导核心组织进行专门研究，或请苏联专家作最后决定。在合理化建议委员会和技术研究小组里，要吸收有科学技术知识的技术人员、有丰富的实际制作经验的老技术工人和有操作经验的熟练工人参加，以便使劳动经验和科学技术知识，修理工人的制作经验和直接生产工人的操作经验密切地结合起来，大家取长补短，发挥集体的力量，丰富和补充原有的建议，解决各种困难，统一技术认识。钢绳厂有百分之八十的老工人都参加了技术研究小组，采取一人提出大家研究的做法，使建议得以很快实现，克服了积压合理化建议的现象，使合理化建议真正成为群众性的运动。
    三、技术革新运动促进了企业管理的改善，企业管理水平的提高又保证了技术革新运动的正常进行。因为技术革新运动是按照均衡生产的原则，解决薄弱环节，加强生产的均衡性；或者突破主要生产工序，打破现有生产的均衡，争取达到更高的生产水平。均衡生产的发展变化，生产水平的提高，是由使用新机械、新工具和采用新的操作方法与新技术决定的，所以技术革新是加强计划管理最生动的内容。而任何一项新技术的采用，又必然引出一系列管理上的问题。如训练工人掌握新技术、拟订新的操作规程、修改技术定额、按照新的不均衡拟定技术措施计划、在采用新技术的基础上制订先进的生产计划、组织原材料的供应、剩余劳动力的妥善安置、新创造的大量制作等等，都必须把企业管理工作提高一步，才能与之相适应。如钢绳厂工人中出现了大量的合理化倡议后，领导上就加强了对修理工段的领导，发挥修理工段的潜力，将革新技术的制作列入修理工段的月计划和季度计划，按进度施工。结果，一九五三年第四季度，修理工段除完成日常任务外，又制作了新机械九十九件。另外由于革新者栗根源的倡议，又组织了钢绳厂和金属制品厂的互助协作。栗根源创造的打模机两厂都需要，钢绳厂没有翻砂设备，金属制品厂没有图纸和车床，结果两厂合作制作了四台，每厂都分到了两台。由于及时制作，就保证了技术革新运动的经常发展。又如一九五四年鞍山钢铁公司的关键问题之一，是如何提高初轧厂的产量和质量，以满足轧钢各厂对钢胚的需要。在公司的帮助与指导下，初轧厂拟定了一九五四年全年技术措施计划，提出要实现四十个课题和十九件专家建议，在全厂生产技术代表会议上大家又提出八十个课题，经过讨论决议列入全年技术措施计划。这些课题和专家建议若都能实现，全年可给国家增产三千多亿元，而投资只需二百多亿元。这种做法给全厂职工明确指出了努力的方向。这样从公司到厂、矿，就更有组织更有领导地推动了革新运动的开展。
    四、虚心学习苏联先进经验，坚决贯彻苏联专家建议，是开展技术革新运动的重要条件。运动中许多重大创造改进和先进的操作方法，都是在苏联专家亲自参加研究，供给各种技术参考书籍和热心指导下，才获得成功的。有的厂矿没有苏联专家，但他们也能从书籍上学习苏联先进经验。在学习苏联和贯彻苏联专家建议的工作中，必须要有坚韧不拔的顽强精神。克服各种困难和思想障碍，特别是英美技术思想的抵抗。学习苏联或贯彻苏联专家建议获得成功后，应用这些生动的事实反复教育全体职工。同时，要建立一定的制度。如向专家汇报、专家建议的登记、公布专家建议，及时检查贯彻执行情况；指派先进的技术人员做专家助手，建立专门组织机构或设置专职人员研究和贯彻专家建议；请专家作报告，组织职工学习俄文，对学习苏联、贯彻专家建议成绩优良者给予一定的奖励等等，使学习苏联和贯彻苏联专家建议成为有领导有组织的群众运动。
    五、必须深入进行思想教育，提高职工的阶级觉悟，克服各种思想障碍。整个技术革新运动过程是改进设备提高技术水平的过程，同时也是先进思想战胜落后思想的过程。在运动中要不断向全体职工进行总路线的教育，要注意启发、培养各个不同工种的老工人及技术人员的先进思想，用真人真事教育全体职工。在技术革新运动中，大体有下面几种思想情况：老技术工人十分熟悉现有设备的性能，并有丰富的操作经验，整个运动中已经获得成功的创造中，有百分之九十都是出自老工人之手。但这些老工人往往残存着在旧社会所受的影响，爱面子，怕不成功“丢人现眼”，以及想“露一手”，只愿个人单干。在个别的老技术工人当中，也存在着保守思想，认为创造是多余，白费事。技术人员中有一部分在张明山创造反围盘成功之后，亲眼看到了工人的创造智慧，在这方面有了进一步的认识，在技术革新运动开展起来以后，也愿意和工人结合共同创造，可是思想上还多少有些距离，特别是遇到工人提出的建议是自己在书本上没有学过的时候，就不敢插手，恐怕一旦不成功失了技术人员的身份。另一部分技术人员好高鹜远，喜欢自己根据书本设计一套庞大的装置，而不愿和工人共同研究。熟练工人往往有墨守成规的保守思想，认为“操作多少年啦，就是这样过来的。”革新技术改进设备后，操作方法要根本改变，怕麻烦嫌不顺手，甚至怕在试验当中影响自己得超额计件工资。对工人和技术人员的这些思想，必须耐心的说服教育，提高他们的觉悟，使他们自觉地积极地发挥创造智慧，使他们从个人单干走向集体创造。运动开展较好的单位，都是由于领导上深入调查职工的思想，不断提高了职工的思想认识，使运动不断前进的。如小型厂工程师周任源，在张明山提出反围盘的建议时，他认为在英、美、日、德等国都未试验成功，张明山的建议也怕不成功。经领导上不断地帮助，思想认识上不断提高，反围盘试验成功后，他主动作了检讨，并积极和工人一道研究试验，亲自参加了毛轧南部翻钢机的创造。又如钢绳厂在运动中了解到老工人栗根源在创造卷线机成功后，认为应该“雁过留声，人过留名”，怕以后有一件事弄不成功，就要丢脸，因此要求调动工作。厂长、总支书记便马上找栗根源谈话，帮助他树立国家主人翁的思想，同时又帮助他解决生活上和创造工作中的各种困难。栗根源经过领导上的帮助，认识提高了，向领导上提出保证：“我这个旧眼光一定要换掉，我要把全部的技术都贡献给国家。”紧接着又连续创造成功五件机械设备。这生动地说明了只有不正确的思想被战胜后，运动才有了巩固的思想基础，才使运动不断前进有了有力的保证。
    以上这些工作仅是部分厂矿取得的经验，还有不少的厂矿并没有做到这样程度，并且还存在很多问题，这都需要我们今后努力解决和继续提高。
