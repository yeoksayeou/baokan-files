    Improving Technology is the Greatest Guarantee for Completing Plans
    Wang Linghao, Open Hearth Furnace Shift Foreman, Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steelmaking Plant

    In the first quarter of this year, the three open-hearth furnaces under my management achieved 37 heats of rapid steelmaking, exceeding the state plan by 9.2 percent.

    Rapid steelmaking is not a simple matter. It requires speed in all stages: furnace repair, charging, refining... to achieve a single instance of rapid steelmaking. Rapid furnace repair and rapid charging are relatively easy to handle. As long as manpower is well-organized, the scheduling work is well done, and everyone operates more intensively, the standards can be met. However, rapid refining depends on technology. Most of the steel we make now is high-quality steel, and many high-quality steels require high temperatures during smelting. For example, seamless steel requires 1520 degrees Celsius. The higher the furnace temperature, the faster it needs to be refined, otherwise the furnace will be damaged. However, it is not enough to just focus on speed; the quality of the steel must also be guaranteed, the steel grade must be controlled, and unplanned steel must not be produced. In order to master this complex technology, in the first quarter, under the guidance of Soviet experts, we repeatedly experimented and researched, and finally successfully tested the "high-temperature rapid refining method." This experience has now been promoted in all three furnaces in our shift, and the entire plant is also promoting it.

    In the process of exploring the "high-temperature rapid refining method," I deeply felt the importance of learning technology. The country's requirements for production are getting higher day by day, and the steelmaking industry is particularly complex. Whether it is improving quality or increasing output, it cannot be separated from technology. Just being active and hardworking cannot solve the problem. I used to be a farmer. In 1949, when I was 19 years old, I stepped into the factory gate. Now I can independently master the technical operations of three furnaces, precisely because I grasped this point - learning technology.

    The comrades in the factory all say that I learn technology quickly. Yes, I have put in a lot of effort to learn technology. When I first came, I learned operations from the old workers; later, I signed a teaching contract with the technicians and asked them to explain theoretical knowledge to me anytime, anywhere; the factory started amateur technical training classes, and I insisted on systematically studying algebra, physics, and chemistry; when Soviet experts came, I earnestly implemented their suggestions and strived to learn new Soviet technologies... However, none of this is the most fundamental. The most fundamental thing is the Party's education of me, which has raised my class consciousness. Because I know that the Party, the country, and the people need me to learn technology to build socialist and communist society, I am not afraid of difficulties and have persevered in learning to this day. I will work even harder in the future, finish the amateur technical training class, and also attend an amateur university. I must constantly improve myself, constantly learn skills, and contribute more to our beloved motherland, so that socialist society comes faster and sooner.

    提高技术是完成计划的最大保证
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂平炉值班工长　王凌好
    今年第一季度，我管的三个炼钢炉，实现了三十七炉快速炼钢，超额百分之九点二完成了国家计划。
    快速炼钢不是一件简单的事，这得补炉、装料、精炼……各个阶段都快速，才能凑和起来实现一次快速炼钢。快速补炉和快速装料还比较好办，只要把人手组织好，调度工作做好，大家操作紧张些，就可以达到标准。但是，快速精炼就非得靠技术不行。我们现在炼的大部分是优质钢，很多优质钢熔炼时都需要高温。像无缝钢就需要摄氏一千五百二十度。炉子温度高，炼得就更要快，慢了炉子就会烧坏。但是，光顾快也不行，还得保证钢的质量，掌握钢种，不出非计划钢。为了掌握这个复杂的技术，我们在第一季度里，在苏联专家的指导下，反复试验钻研，终于把“高温快速精炼法”试验成功了。现在这个经验在我们班里三个炉子上都推广了，全厂也正在推行。
    在摸索“高温快速精炼法”的过程中，更使我深深感到学习技术的重要。国家在生产上的要求一天比一天高，炼钢这一行又特别复杂，不论提高质量提高产量，都离不开技术，光凭积极肯干是解决不了问题的。我从前是个农民，一九四九年，我十九岁那年，才迈进工厂的大门，现在我能够独立地掌握三个炉子的技术操作，就是因为我抓住了这一条——学技术。
    厂里的同志们都说我学技术学得快。是的，为了学技术，我下了不少工夫。乍来的时候，向老工人学操作；往后，又和技术员订立了教学合同，随时随地请他们给我讲理论知识；工厂开办了业余技术训练班，我又坚持了系统地学习代数、物理、化学；苏联专家来了，我又认真地贯彻专家建议，努力学习苏联的新技术；……可是，这一切都不是最根本的。最根本的是党对我的教育，提高了我的阶级觉悟。因为我知道党、国家、人民需要我学会技术来建设社会主义和共产主义社会，所以我才不怕困难，一股劲地坚持学到现在。我以后还要更加努力地学习，念完了业余技术训练班，还要念业余大学。我一定要不断地提高自己，不断地学本事，好为我们可爱的祖国贡献更大的力量，让社会主义社会来得更快、更早。
