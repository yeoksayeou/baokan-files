Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech in New York on the evening of March 29th exposed the United States' attempt to prevent the Geneva Conference from resolving pressing issues in Asia through consultation. It also revealed the U.S.'s coercion and intimidation of its "allies" to follow the American policy of creating tension, so that the Geneva Conference would not achieve the results that the people of the world expect.

Dulles's speech was intended to "clarify the U.S. attitude" to Britain, France, and other countries before the Geneva Conference convened. Dulles least wants to see the easing of international tensions, so he continues to peddle the bankrupt lies of the "threat" and "danger" from the Soviet Union and China. Given that "perhaps some in" his "allied" camp "may have other ideas," Dulles warned of this and said, "There is absolutely no reason to believe that this danger [of a full-scale war] has permanently disappeared." This is Dulles's basis for coercing his "allies" not to resolve issues through consultation at the Geneva Conference.

In his speech, Dulles not only did not mention how to stop the war in Indochina and restore peace, but viciously threatened war. He clamored that the U.S. would not only provide "material assistance" to suppress the struggle of the Indochinese people for independence but also demanded that its "allies" "deal with it through joint action." Dulles emphasized that "determination" must be made, even if such action would "cause serious risks." This is a new step in the American conspiracy to interfere in Indochina. The U.S. authorities are clearly trying to create more and greater obstacles before the Geneva Conference to obstruct the path of peaceful negotiation and find new ways to interfere in Indochina for the long term. To support this claim, Dulles talked at length in his speech about the "paramount importance" of Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia in terms of "strategy," as well as the "rice bowl," "raw materials," "markets," and "bases" of the Southeast Asian region. Here, Dulles clearly expressed the ambition of the U.S. to covet the rich resources of this region and attempt to control them. According to Dulles, if the people of Indochina gained independence and freedom, it would constitute a "serious threat" to "free society." Therefore, he lectured America's "allies" that they "should not adopt a passive attitude" but "must take risks."

Dulles glossed over the peaceful resolution of the Korean question in his speech. He kept silent about the withdrawal of all foreign troops, especially U.S. troops, and only proposed the unilateral withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This clearly shows that the U.S. authorities do not intend to seriously discuss the withdrawal of troops and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference in accordance with the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, but attempt to occupy South Korea for a long time and continue to maintain tension in Korea.

In addition to this, Dulles also reiterated at length in his speech his hostile stance towards the Chinese people, attempting to distort history, reverse facts, and shift the responsibility for the aggression crimes that the U.S. ruling clique has committed and is continuing to commit in front of the people of the world to the peace-loving Chinese people. Dulles's tune can only further confirm that the U.S. authorities are deliberately obstructing the improvement of relations between major powers to promote peace in the Far East.

Dulles's speech is clearly part of the propaganda campaign launched by the U.S. government near the Geneva Conference, as reported by American newspapers and news agencies. Its purpose is to poison the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference and coerce its "allies" to abandon consideration of their own interests at the conference and obey the U.S.'s obstructionist policy, so as to prevent the conference from promoting peace in Asia through consultation.

### 杜勒斯发表演说毒化日内瓦会议空气  胁迫英法跟随美国制造紧张局势的政策

    杜勒斯发表演说毒化日内瓦会议空气
    胁迫英法跟随美国制造紧张局势的政策
   【新华社一日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯三月二十九日晚在纽约发表的演说，暴露了美国企图阻止日内瓦会议协商解决亚洲的迫切问题，并胁迫和恫吓其“盟国”跟随美国的制造紧张局势的政策，以便使日内瓦会议得不到世界人民所期望的成果。
    杜勒斯的这篇演说，是为了要在日内瓦会议召开之前向英、法等国“澄清美国的态度”。杜勒斯最不愿意看到的，就是国际紧张局势的缓和，因此他继续玩弄早已破了产的鬼话，大叫苏联和中国的“威胁”和“危险”。鉴于在其“盟国”阵营中
  “或许有人会有另外的想法”，杜勒斯对此提出警告，并且说：“绝对没有理由认为这种（发生全面战争的）危险已经永远消逝了。”这就是杜勒斯胁迫其“盟国”不得在日内瓦会议上通过协商来解决问题的根据。
    杜勒斯在演说中不但丝毫没有提到如何来停止印度支那战争与恢复和平的问题，反而恶狠狠地威胁着要战争。他叫嚣美国不但要提供“物质援助”来从事镇压印度支那人民争取独立的斗争，而且要求它的“盟国”“用联合行动来予以对付”。杜勒斯强调必须“下定决心”，即使这种行动会“引起严重的风险”也在所不惜。这是美国干涉印度支那的阴谋的新步骤。美国当局显然要在日内瓦会议前制造更多更大的障碍，以阻挠和平协商的道路，并且为长期干涉印度支那寻找新的途径。为了支持这一主张，杜勒斯在演说中大谈其印度支那和整个东南亚在“战略”上的“超越一切的重要性”，以及东南亚地区的“米仓”、“原料”、“市场”和“基地”。在这里，杜勒斯明白表露了美国垂涎这个地区的富源并企图加以控制的野心。按照杜勒斯的意见，如果印度支那人民获得了独立与自由，就会构成对“自由社会”的“严重威胁”。因此，他教训美国的“盟国”“不应该采取消极的态度”，而“必须承担风险”。
    杜勒斯在演说中把和平解决朝鲜问题轻轻带过，他闭口不谈撤退一切外国军队首先是美国军队，而仅仅提出要中国人民志愿军单方面地撤退。这清楚地表明了美国当局不打算按照朝鲜停战协定的规定在日内瓦会议上来认真讨论撤军问题以及和平解决朝鲜问题，而企图长期占领南朝鲜，继续在朝鲜保持紧张局势。
    除此而外，杜勒斯还在演说中长篇大论地重申其敌视中国人民的立场，企图歪曲历史，颠倒事实，把美国统治集团在全世界人民眼前曾经犯下的并正在继续进行的侵略罪行的责任推给坚持和平的中国人民。杜勒斯的这种调子，只能进一步证实了美国当局蓄意阻挠改善大国之间的关系以促进远东和平。
    杜勒斯的这篇演说显然是美国报纸通讯社所报道的美国政府在临近日内瓦会议时所发动的宣传运动的一部分，其目的就在于毒化日内瓦会议的气氛，并胁迫其“盟国”在会上放弃本身利益的考虑而顺从美国的阻挠政策，以便阻止会议通过协商来促进亚洲的和平。
