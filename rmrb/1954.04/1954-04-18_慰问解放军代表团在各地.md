Visiting PLA Delegation in Various Places

    **The Determination of Soldiers on the Kangzang Plateau**

    "Chairman Mao's envoys are here!" The news quickly spread throughout Ya'an, Kangding, Daofu, and Ganzi, and also reached the PLA outposts guarding the Dadu River and Erlang Mountain. These brave soldiers, who guarded the frontier of the motherland day and night, were overjoyed to hear that the people's delegation from the motherland was coming to visit them. Everywhere, colorful arches were being erected to welcome their loved ones, and slogans and wall newspapers were being put up to express their determination to their loved ones. Motor vehicle drivers volunteered to take on the glorious task of transporting the delegates, and many even wrote guarantees to ensure safe driving and prevent accidents. The soldiers of the Tibetan People's Regiment stationed in Daofu vacated their barracks, built with their own hands, for their loved ones to live in, and temporarily moved into cave dwellings. The soldiers of the Ganzi Motor Vehicle Team also gave their newly built houses at the foot of the snow-capped mountains to the visiting delegation, and temporarily lived in their vehicles. They said, "We are used to living in the 'GMC' (referring to ten-wheel trucks) hotel, and we should let our loved ones live more comfortably!"

    The soldiers' love for the people of the motherland inspired every member of the delegation. Disregarding the heavy snow on Erlang Mountain and the strong winds on Mount Zheduo, they were determined to delve into every company and convey the entrustment of the people of the motherland to the soldiers. On March 8th, the delegation arrived at Lanchi Town at the foot of Erlang Mountain. The soldiers stationed here expressed their firm determination to the delegates. Yuan Bochuan, a squad leader of a certain unit, said: After studying the General Line, we have a broader vision. In the purchase of public bonds, the number we subscribed exceeded the expected number by more than 600 percent. Communication soldier Huang Xianchao wanted to use all his accumulated savings of 4 million yuan to buy public bonds. The instructor explained to him that he should do what he could, and he said, "Supporting the economic construction of the motherland is also my responsibility. We climb ice and lie in the snow on the plateau, isn't it all for the motherland to be built even better!" When soldier Wang Liquan was talking to the comrades of the delegation about his feelings, when he couldn't express them, he pointed to a couplet on the decorated building, which read: "Who says Kangzang is arduous, the spirit of overcoming difficulties is the true color of a hero; we have lofty ideals, let the socialist flowers bloom all over the plateau of the motherland." (Tang Lingming)

    **Back to Mother's Home**

    In the reception room of a certain PLA unit, Zhang Benlin, a representative of the Sixth Sub-Delegation, a Hebei Province agricultural labor model, and director of the Nanhetou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianxian County, was attracted by a silk banner hanging on the wall. He clearly remembered that this banner, embroidered with the words Cangxian Prefecture, was presented by the people of his hometown to the unit of his close comrades-in-arms. Zhang Benlin asked the director of the political department in surprise: "Are there any Wang Bingwen and Kang Yukes here?"

    "What, do you know them!"

    "This is my home!" Zhang Benlin said happily, "I was discharged from the army in 1948 after being wounded. When I was in the army, I was a company commander, Wang Bingwen was the political instructor of our battalion, and Kang Yuke was the instructor of our company."

    "You've really come home." The director of the political department said with equal surprise, "They are all here, Comrade Wang Bingwen is now the section chief, and Comrade Kang Yuke is also the instructor!"

    Soon, Wang Bingwen received a notice: The delegation was going to their section, and there was also his old subordinate Zhang Benlin in the delegation. What a double blessing! Wang Bingwen told Kang Yuke about the news and gathered all the comrades in the section to greet them. As soon as Zhang Benlin saw the amiable old chief, he shouted "Instructor" and rushed forward. Wang Bingwen stroked his shoulder and introduced to everyone: "This is Comrade Zhang Benlin who made several war merits in the War of Liberation. He is a brave and resourceful company commander." Zhang Benlin was so excited that his speech was a little hurried. He told everyone how he responded to the call of the People's Government after he was discharged from the army, took the lead in establishing an agricultural production cooperative, and won the glorious titles of "High-Yield Model" and "Glorious Army Flag" with a yield of 850 jin per mu. He also talked about seeing the National Day celebration in Tiananmen Square and meeting Chairman Mao in Huairen Hall in 1951. Wang Bingwen repeatedly praised: "He is a hero in war, and a pioneer in production. He deserves to be an advanced socialist fighter!"

    Then, Wang Bingwen accompanied the representatives to the guard company to offer their condolences. On the way, they ran into Kang Yuke. It turned out that Kang Yuke was studying in the General Line training class. Upon receiving Wang Bingwen's letter, he immediately rushed to meet his long-separated comrades with great enthusiasm. They hugged each other as soon as they met. Kang Yuke patted the medal hanging on Zhang Benlin's chest, jokingly and congratulatingly said: "It's not easy, you are already the director of a cooperative leading hundreds of people!" "Our army has made even greater progress!" Zhang Benlin said as he walked, "When we were together, the army not only didn't have airplanes and tanks, but also didn't have many artillery pieces. Now we have them all, the changes are really great!"

    They walked and talked, and unknowingly arrived at the guard company. Zhang Benlin walked to the front of the soldiers lined up to welcome them, looking at the serious and orderly ranks, and the healthy and enthusiastic faces, and suddenly he remembered the scene of issuing combat orders to the soldiers in the army in the past, but he immediately thought that he was now leading an agricultural production cooperative, and was engaged in another kind of battle. He said to the soldiers with great pleasure: "I am like a girl who has been married for many years, and today I have returned to my mother's home. Seeing my comrades-in-arms is more intimate than seeing my own brothers. Comrades, we have one goal, we will always be together!"
                                    (Li Shucun)

    **Mother Wang Arrives at the "Tashan Hero Regiment"**

    This is the clubhouse of the "Tashan Hero Regiment" of the People's Liberation Army. The clubhouse was crowded with soldiers inside and out, shouting to see Mother Wang Yuexiang in the delegation. Suddenly, four soldiers lifted her up, and azaleas and mountain pears were thrown at her in bunches. Mother Wang Yuexiang took the azaleas, her eyes flashing with excited tears, and waved to the soldiers and said: "Comrades, hello!"

    Mother Wang Yuexiang is over fifty years old, and she is from Baitengkeng Village, Shangshe District, Tangshi Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province. She joined the Red Guards as early as the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and mobilized her husband to join the Red Army. Her husband died in the war. After the Red Army marched north, she still persisted in underground struggle. Not long after Xingguo County was liberated in 1949, she sent her son to the army again, and she led the masses to participate in production. Now, she has become a provincial-level special model of revolutionary martyrs' family and a member of the county people's government.

    How could the soldiers not be excited to see the mother of a soldier who had such a glorious history of struggle? Lin Huisheng, a soldier of the Tashan Defense Hero Company, wrote his feelings in Mother Wang's commemorative album: "Old mother, you are our dear mother. I remember your words! We must improve our skills, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend the happiness of thousands of mothers in the motherland!" As he wrote, tears welled up in his eyes. Soldier Liao Minfeng personally drew a plum blossom with light ink and gave it to Mother Wang Yuexiang. The plum blossoms bloom proudly in the severe cold and snowy weather, symbolizing Mother Wang Yuexiang's heroic, tenacious, and indomitable noble qualities! (Yan Kai)

    **On the Ocean**

    The warship set sail with the representatives of the delegation. Seagulls circled and danced with the warship, and the waves rolled in jubilation. The sea breeze was still a bit cold, but people's hearts contained infinite warmth.

    This was the morning of March 3rd, when a part of the national people's delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army, led by Deputy General Leader Huang Songling, arrived at a certain place on the front line of coastal defense. After a grand condolence ceremony was held on the deck of the warship, the sailors decided to take their loved ones from the motherland to the ocean, so that their loved ones could see how vast and wide the ocean of the motherland was, and see how the young People's Navy was vigilantly guarding the ocean of the motherland. Volunteer Army representative Zhao Hongjun followed the direction pointed by a sailor, looking at the boundless territorial waters of the motherland, and praised repeatedly: "I have lived for more than 20 years, and it was not until today that I saw with my own eyes that the ocean of the motherland is so vast!"

    The People's Navy's flotilla sped over from a distance. Look, they are riding the wind and waves, galloping vertically and horizontally, and approaching the warship. The sound of the whistle cut through the sky above the ocean, expressing respect to Chairman Mao's representatives, and the representatives on the warship also shouted in unison: "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" How happy they must be to have seen the neat lineup of the People's Navy with their own eyes! Volunteer Army representative and special class hero Lu Yaowen said to Zhao Xiaoan, a first-class combat hero of the Navy: "American imperialism boasted about their 'maritime superiority' in Korea. Today, it seems that it will also be declared bankrupt like 'air superiority'!" Zhao Xiaoan nodded and said: "We are working hard to build a strong navy. I believe: We will definitely give a strong blow to the imperialists who dare to risk aggression!"

    The warships were tossing in the waves, but the sailors were still neatly lined up on the deck, motionless. Volunteer Army representative Xu Jinsheng said to the several sailors beside him: "The naval elder brothers not only have to fight against the enemies at sea, but also have to fight against the wind and waves at sea, which is more difficult than us. You are really the most beloved people!" Sailor Sun Chengda said modestly: "Although we are suffering, it is much better than the Volunteer Army fighting in the ice and snow. You are the most beloved people!" Li Tianying, a national agricultural labor model, grabbed their hands and said, "You are all the most beloved people!" (Ni Huanghe)

    On the coastal defense, the comrades of the delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army went deep into each company to offer condolences, and told the soldiers about the brilliant achievements of the motherland's economic construction. This is Comrade Zhang Peilin, a representative of the delegation, telling the naval soldiers stationed on a certain island about the economic construction of the motherland.

    慰问解放军代表团在各地
    康藏高原上战士的决心
    “毛主席的使者来啦！”消息很快传遍了雅安、康定、道孚、甘孜，也传到了守卫在大渡河和二郎山的解放军驻地。这些日日夜夜守卫在祖国边疆的勇士们，听说祖国人民慰问团要到他们驻地去慰问，该是多么高兴啊。到处在搭彩门欢迎自己的亲人，到处在贴标语出墙报向亲人表示自己的决心。汽车驾驶员们自动报名担负运送代表的光荣任务，很多人还写了保证书，保证安全行驶，不出事故。驻在道孚的藏民团的战士们，把用亲手建造起来的营房腾给亲人住，自己暂时搬到窑洞里去。甘孜汽车队的战士们，也把自己在雪山下新盖起来的楼房让给慰问团，自己暂时住到汽车上。他们说：“我们已经住惯了‘吉姆西’（指十轮卡车）大旅馆，应当让亲人们住得舒适些！”
    战士们对祖国人民的热爱，鼓舞着每一个代表团同志们的心。他们不顾二郎山上的大雪，不顾折多山上的狂风，决心深入每个连队，把祖国人民的委托都传达给战士。三月八日，代表团到了二郎山麓的滥池子镇。驻在这里的战士们向代表们表示了自己的坚强决心。某部班长袁伯川说：我们经过总路线学习以后，眼光看得更远了。在购买公债中，我们认购的数字超过了预计数字的百分之六百还要多。通讯员黄贤超要把多年积累的四十万元全部购买公债，指导员向他解释要他量力而行，他说：“支援祖国经济建设，也有我的一份。我们在高原上爬冰卧雪，还不是为了祖国建设得更美好！”战士王立全在给代表团的同志谈述自己的心情，谈到无法表达的时候，指了指彩楼上的一幅对联，上面写道：“谁个说康藏艰苦，有克服困难精神方是英雄本色；我们有崇高理想，让社会主义花朵开遍祖国高原”。（唐灵明）
      回到娘家来了
    在解放军某部的接待室里，第六总分团的代表、河北省农业劳动模范、献县南河头村农业生产合作社主任张本林，被墙上挂着的一面锦旗吸引住了。他清清楚楚地记得：这面绣有沧县专区字样的锦旗，是家乡人民赠给亲密战友所在的那支部队的。张本林有点惊讶地问政治部主任：“这里有叫王丙文、康玉珂的吗？”
    “怎么，你认识他们！”
    “这是我的家啊！”张本林喜出望外地说，“我是一九四八年负伤后复员的。在部队时我当连长，王丙文是我们营的教导员，康玉珂是我们那个连的指导员。”
    “真是到了家啦。”政治部主任同样惊喜地说，“他们都在这里，王丙文同志现在当了科长，康玉珂同志也当了教导员了！”
    很快，王丙文得到了通知：慰问团要到他们科里去，代表团中还有他的老部属张本林。真是喜上加喜啊！王丙文一面把这个消息转告给康玉珂，一面集合全科同志出来迎接。张本林一看见和蔼可亲的老首长，喊了一声“教导员”，就扑上前去。王丙文抚摸着他的肩头，向大家介绍：“这就是在解放战争中立过几次战功的张本林同志，他是一个勇敢、机智的连长。”张本林兴奋得说话也有点急促了。他给大家讲述了自己复员后如何响应人民政府的号召，带头建立农业生产合作社，以每亩地八百五十斤的产量，获得了全省“丰产模范”和“荣军旗帜”的光荣称号。他也谈到一九五一年国庆节在天安门观礼、在怀仁堂见到了毛主席的情景。王丙文连连称赞：“打仗是英雄，生产打先锋，真不愧是个社会主义的先进战士！”
    接着，王丙文陪同代表们到警卫连去慰问了。半道上，就碰到了康玉珂。原来，康玉珂正在总路线训练班里学习，他接到王丙文的信，马上怀着满腔热情来迎接久别的战友。他们一见面就拥抱起来。康玉珂拍拍张本林胸前挂着的奖章，似开玩笑又似祝贺地说：“不简单啊，你已经是领导几百人的合作社主任了！”“咱们军队的进步更快啊！”张本林边走边说，“咱们在一块的时候，部队不光是没有飞机、坦克，就是大炮也不多。现在都有了，变化真大呀！”
    他们一边走，一边谈，不知不觉就到了警卫连。张本林走到列队欢迎他们的战士们的面前，看着严肃整齐的行列，健壮热情的面孔，猛然他又想起了过去在部队时向战士们下达作战命令的情景，不过，他马上又想到自己现在领导的是农业生产合作社，进行的是另外一种战斗。他以极愉快的心情向战士们讲道：“我像出嫁多年的姑娘，今天回到娘家来了。见到战友们，比见到亲兄弟还亲。同志们，我们的目标是一个，我们永远在一起！”
                                    （李树村）
      王妈妈到了“塔山英雄团”
    这里是人民解放军“塔山英雄团”的俱乐部。俱乐部的里里外外都挤满了战士，他们叫嚷着要看看代表团中的王月香老妈妈。突然，四个战士把她抬起来了，杜鹃花、山梨花，一束束地向她掷去。王月香老妈妈拿着杜鹃花，眼里闪着激动的泪光，向战士们招摇着说：“同志们，你们好！”
    王月香老妈妈已经五十多岁了，是江西省兴国县上社区塘石乡白坑村人。早在第二次国内革命战争时期就参加了赤卫队，并动员自己的丈夫参加了红军。丈夫在战争中牺牲了。红军北上后，她依然坚持着地下斗争。一九四九年兴国县解放不久，她又把自己的儿子送到了部队里，自己带领群众参加生产。如今，她已成了全省的特等烈属模范和县人民政府的委员了。
    战士们看到了有过这样光荣斗争历史的子弟兵的母亲，怎能不激动呢？塔山守备英雄连的战士林辉生，把自己的心情写在王妈妈的纪念册上：“老妈妈，你是我们亲爱的母亲。我记住你的话！一定要提高技术，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫祖国千千万万妈妈的幸福！”他写着，眼睛里涌出了一滴滴的泪水。战士廖民风亲手用淡墨描了一幅腊梅花，送给王月香老妈妈。朵朵梅花在严寒的风雪天里傲然开放，象征着王月香老妈妈英勇顽强，不屈不挠的高贵品质！　（颜开）
      在海洋上
    军舰载着慰问团的代表出发了。海鸥随着军舰盘旋飞舞，波涛在欢腾地翻滚。海风吹来还有些冷意，但人们的心里却蕴藏着无限的温暖。
    这是三月三日的上午，全国人民慰问人民解放军的一部分代表，在黄松龄副总团长率领下，到了海防前线某地。在军舰的甲板上举行了隆重的慰问仪式后，水兵们决定要把祖国的亲人载到海洋上去，让亲人们看一看祖国的海洋是多么辽阔广大，看一看年青的人民海军是怎样警惕地守卫着祖国的海洋。志愿军代表赵鸿钧顺着一个水兵指的方向，遥望着一望无际的祖国的领海，连声称赞：“我活了二十多年，直到今天才亲眼看到了祖国的海洋是这么辽阔广大啊！”
    人民海军的艇队从远处飞驶过来了。看，它们乘风破浪，纵横驰骋，向军舰靠拢过来了。汽笛声划过了海洋的上空，表示向毛主席的代表致敬，军舰上的代表们也齐声高呼：“人民解放军万岁！”“朱总司令万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”他们亲眼看到了人民海军的严整阵容，该是多么高兴啊！志愿军代表、特等功臣卢耀文，对海军甲等战斗英雄赵孝庵说：“美帝国主义在朝鲜吹嘘他们的‘海上优势’，今天看来，它也将和‘空中优势’一样地宣告破产！”赵孝庵点点头说：“我们正在为建设一支强大的海军而努力。我相信：我们一定会给敢于冒险侵犯的帝国主义者以强有力的打击！”
    舰艇在海涛中巅簸着，但水兵们仍然整齐地排列在甲板上，一动也不动。志愿军代表徐金生对自己身边的几个水兵说：“海军老大哥不仅要和海上的敌人作战，还要和海上的风浪作战，比我们还要艰苦。你们真是最可爱的人！”水兵孙承达谦虚地说：“我们虽然艰苦，但比起志愿军在冰天雪地里作战好得多了。你们才是最可爱的人哩！”全国农业劳动模范李田英，一把拉住他们的手说：“你们都是最可爱的人！”　（倪黄河）（附图片）
    在海防上，慰问人民解放军代表团的同志们深入到每个连队进行慰问，并给战士们讲述祖国经济建设的辉煌成就。这是慰问团的代表张培霖同志，向驻在某岛的海军战士们，讲述祖国经济建设的情况。（解放军画报社稿　程富年摄）
