[Our Newspaper] Workers in various regions are launching a new high tide of labor competitions to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day. In the capital, workers in many units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Beijing People's Printing Factory are intensively carrying out competitions. He Yinghua and Yuan Yaozhi, technicians from the Tool Workshop of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory, are researching and developing a tool for "scraping bed surfaces." If successful, one person's work in a day will be equivalent to six people's work in six days. They expressed their intention to successfully test it before "May Day." Dozens of factories in Tianjin have already participated in the competition. Workers at the Tianjin Steel Plant are deeply engaged in labor competitions to increase production and save 8.43 billion yuan of wealth for the country throughout the year. The vast number of workers in the machinery, light industry, and textile systems in Shenyang have launched challenges and responses, ensuring that new achievements are made before "May Day." Twenty-six factories in the Shenyang local industrial system, such as the Enamel Factory, have also successively joined the labor competition. Workers in the Third Mechanic Workshop of the Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory guarantee to increase production by 840 million yuan in the second quarter. Workers in other units such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have also set guarantee conditions to launch competitions. The determination platform of the state-owned Shanghai No. 15 Cotton Textile Factory is covered with workers' pledges. In Wuhan, many factories have also set off a wave of competition. The task of the Luo Rongxiang team at the Wuchang Shipyard in April is to forge large diesel engine forgings to support the peaceful construction of the Korean people. They are launching a competition to complete the entire month's plan four and a half days ahead of schedule. Nearly 30,000 workers in Rehe Province are working hard to exceed the competition plan.
	
Workers in remote areas are also enthusiastically launching competition activities and striving to overfulfill national plans. Workers at the Manzhouli Station guarantee rapid and safe cargo handling for import and export, conscientiously implement the Yang Maolin loading method, and increase the technical loading volume by 3%. The workers constructing the Wushaoling Tunnel on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway launched a labor competition to welcome "May Day" in early April. They launched a resolute struggle against running water and collapses, and completed the last long tunnel project ten days ahead of schedule on April 8th. The Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions specially called on workers, technicians, and staff throughout the province to participate in labor competitions and launch a wave of technological innovation in order to welcome "May Day." Some factory workers have already started to take action.

Workers in many private factories have also launched competitions. For example, the workers of the Changzhou Private First Machinery Joint Venture are actively rushing to produce new 30-horsepower twin-cylinder engine products to support agricultural production. All factory workers guarantee to complete the assembly of the new product by the end of April as a gift for "May Day."

Workers in various regions have continuously achieved new successes in the competition. After successively breaking quotas, labor model Sheng Li of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant completed the production task for April fifteen days ahead of schedule. Lathe operator Zhao Bingtang completed the entire month's task in ten working days and two hours, and now he is working hard to realize the plan of completing two months' tasks in one month. Since the workers of the steel bar section of the Shenyang Smelter Factory launched the competition, they have completed the operation plan on a daily and ten-day basis and created a tool for cleaning iron bar rust. The workers in the fitter section created eight tools, which greatly improved labor efficiency.
