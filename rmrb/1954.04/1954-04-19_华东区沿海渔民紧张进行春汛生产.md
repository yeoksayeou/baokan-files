Fishermen in the coastal areas of East China's Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces have set sail and begun spring fishing season production.

During this year's spring fishing season production, the number of fishermen going out to sea has increased compared to last year. In Zhejiang Province, the number of fishermen at sea has increased by 28 percent compared to the same period last year, while Shandong Province has seen a 14 percent increase. This year, fishermen are going to sea earlier than in previous years. In Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, fishing boats are setting sail ten days earlier than usual. Fishermen in Pingtan County, Fujian Province, who fish for sharks, are also setting out to sea more than twenty days earlier than in previous years. All fishing boats at Wusongkou, Shanghai, broke the previous custom of not going to sea before the Qingming Festival and began production on March 30th.

Based on the current production situation in the fishing grounds of Zhejiang and Fujian, the fish shoals are thicker than last year. According to statistics from individual areas in Fujian Province, hairtail production during the spring fishing season is four times higher than in the same period last year, and shark production in Dongshan County is more than double that of the same period last year.

The peak season for spring fishing season production has arrived. Currently, local aquatic product administrative departments, fishery production headquarters, and other relevant units are actively organizing transportation and sales efforts to ensure a large supply of fresh fish to meet the needs of urban and rural people during the peak season.

To protect the safety of fishermen's production, East China will add 33 more storm warning stations in major fishing ports this year and strive to formally establish them before the typhoon season. Recently, the East China Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau has transferred management personnel from storm warning stations in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces for centralized training. The management personnel of storm warning stations in Fujian Province are also being trained by the Aquatic Products Bureau of the Provincial Department of Agriculture.

In the past two years, 50 storm warning stations have been established in major fishing ports along the coast of East China, helping fishermen defend against typhoons and strong winds, greatly reducing losses. After the establishment of 33 new storm warning stations this year, they will help more fishermen defend against disasters.

    华东区沿海渔民紧张进行春汛生产
    华东沿海山东、江苏、浙江、福建四省渔民已纷纷扬帆出海，开始春汛生产。
    今年春汛生产中，出海捕鱼的渔民比去年增加，浙江省出海的渔民比去年同时期增加百分之二十八，山东省增加百分之十四。今年春汛渔民出海时间较往年提早，江苏省常熟县出海渔船较往年提早十天，福建省平潭县钓鲨鱼的渔民也较往年早出海二十多天，上海吴淞口全部渔船今年都打破了以往清明前不出海的习惯，已于三月三十日先后出海生产。
    根据目前浙江及福建渔场的生产情况来看，今年的鱼群较去年为厚。福建省根据个别地区的统计，春汛生产中的带鱼产量要比去年同时期增加四倍，东山县的鲨鱼产量也要比去年同时期增加一倍多。
    春汛生产的旺季已经到来，目前各地水产行政部门和渔业生产指挥部等各有关单位，正在积极组织运销力量，保证在旺季以大量鲜鱼供应城乡人民需要。
    为了保护渔民生产安全，华东全区今年将在各主要渔港再增设三十三处暴风警报站，并争取在台风季节前正式成立。最近华东农林水利局已抽调山东、江苏、浙江三省暴风警报站的管理人员集中训练，福建地区的暴风警报站的管理人员，也由该省农业厅水产局负责训练。
    两年来，华东沿海各主要渔港已先后设立了暴风警报站五十处，帮助渔民们防御台风和大风，大大减少了损失。今年三十三处新的暴风警报站建立以后，将帮助更多的渔民防御灾害。
