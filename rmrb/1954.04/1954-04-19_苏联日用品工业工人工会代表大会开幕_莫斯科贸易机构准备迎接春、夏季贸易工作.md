Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th: The first congress of the Soviet Union's Daily Necessities Industry Workers' Union opened in Moscow on the 16th. More than 1,000 workers from national textile, sewing, knitting, leather, and shoemaking enterprises participated in the congress.

P. Korobova, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union's Daily Necessities Industry Workers' Union, delivered a summary report of the work of the Central Committee at the meeting. She pointed out that in the past year, approximately 300 new daily necessities enterprises in the Soviet Union had been put into production. This year, the daily necessities industry must reach the production level stipulated for 1955 in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955). Compared with last year, the total increase in cotton, wool, and silk fabrics will be 432.2 million meters, and the increase in leather shoes will be 20 million pairs. Union members are actively implementing plans to rapidly expand the production of daily necessities. Hundreds of enterprises have entered into socialist competition. Thousands of advanced workers have completed the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. When talking about the welfare of workers in the daily necessities industry, Korobova said that recently, the wages of workers in the sewing, knitting, shoemaking, leather, and fur industries had increased by an average of 7 percent. This year, 145 million rubles have been allocated to improve workers' working conditions, which is twice the amount in 1951. This year, 23,000 houses, more than 200 kindergartens and nurseries, 16 schools, and 7 hospitals will be built for the staff and their families in the daily necessities industry. Currently, there are more than 400 clubs, 800 libraries, and 2,000 "red corners" (note: a type of small club) in various enterprises in the daily necessities industry.

Rizhkov, Minister of the Soviet Union's Daily Necessities Industry, delivered a speech at the congress on the 17th. He pointed out that the output of daily necessities industrial enterprises increased by an average of 6 percent annually from 1937 to 1940, and by an average of more than 12 percent annually in the past three years. Judging from the work summaries of various enterprises, the workers are smoothly implementing the tasks set by the Soviet Communist Party and the government to increase the production of daily necessities. The output of the daily necessities industry in the first quarter of this year increased by approximately 14 percent compared with the same period last year. The quantity of products from various enterprises far exceeded the planned targets. For example, textile production increased by 17 million meters, socks and stockings increased by 2.5 million pairs, and knitted shirts increased by 800,000 pieces; the variety of daily necessities has also greatly increased.

When talking about the improvement of technical equipment in the daily necessities industry, Rizhkov pointed out that more than 200,000 new machines have been put into production in various daily necessities enterprises since the Patriotic War. On the basis of new technical equipment, labor productivity has increased by approximately 22 percent compared with 1950. He said that the Soviet Union will build and renovate 1,200 daily necessities industrial enterprises this year. Relying solely on new production capacity, shoe production will increase by 55 million pairs in the past two years. This year, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Daily Necessities Industry has allocated twice as much funding as last year for the construction of housing and cultural and welfare facilities for workers in the daily necessities industry.
