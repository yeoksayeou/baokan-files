Premier Zhou Enlai's Congratulatory Telegram to Prime Minister Nehru of India

To His Excellency Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of India:

    On the occasion of the signing of the Agreement between China and India on Trade and Communication between the Tibet Region of China and India, I extend my warm congratulations to Your Excellency, and through you to the Government and the people of India. This agreement, concluded between China and India on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, re-establishes the relations between the two countries in the Tibet Region of China on a new basis. The signing of this agreement will not only further strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and India, but also fully demonstrates that as long as all countries jointly abide by the above-mentioned principles and adopt a consultative approach, any existing international problems can be reasonably resolved.

    Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
    April 29, 1954
