How the East China "Youth Daily" Conducted General Line Education for Young Workers
Li Ren

Educating young workers on the General Line is an important task for the Youth League's newspapers in the present and for a long period to come. To carry out in-depth General Line education, the League's newspapers must proceed from the characteristics of young workers, address the ideological problems that commonly exist among them, and pay attention to using various forms of propaganda that young workers like. In this regard, some of the efforts made by the East China "Youth Daily" are worth introducing.

The East China "Youth Daily" first paid attention to the publicity of advanced producers; among them, promoting Wang Chonglun was taken as an important part of conducting General Line education for young workers, calling on them to implement the General Line with practical actions. In view of the general ideological situation of young workers, such as not being humble enough in technical learning, being easily complacent with achievements, and easily discouraged when encountering difficulties, the newspaper published articles such as "Only by Never Being Complacent Can We Always Advance" and "Nothing is Difficult in the World for Those Who Put Their Heart Into It." In the former article, young worker Lu Youde examined his past complacency, saying, "Seeing that I overfulfilled the plan every month in the fourth quarter of last year, I felt that we are very good now, and I didn't put my mind to work and find tricks as often as I used to." But after studying Wang Chonglun's model deeds, seeing that Wang Chonglun was still not complacent even after continuously improving tools, and finally created the universal tool tire, increasing work efficiency by six and a half times, he realized that Wang Chonglun's spirit of never being complacent was worth learning from. So he actively used his brain to improve the tool, and with the help of the veteran workers, he increased the depth of cut when making the oil pump tappet on the diesel engine, and completed the production task twelve days ahead of schedule in December last year. In the latter article, young worker Chen Xiulin examined himself, saying: He used to think that he was doing odd jobs and his technology was not high, so he could not complete three years of work in one year like Wang Chonglun. (Editor's note: This refers to the amount of work completed by Wang Chonglun up to November 18th of last year.) But after hearing the report introducing Wang Chonglun's model deeds, he realized that "Wang Chonglun's machine is not the best, and he was not born with good skills. He was able to create the universal tool tire because he worked hard and learned humbly." He was determined to learn Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking and work spirit. Later, when he was punching filter oil slices, he improved the tool with the help of the veteran workers and increased the output by three times. The East China "Youth Daily" used various practical examples of young workers learning from Wang Chonglun to improve their work to illustrate that "Wang Chonglun's conditions are not better than others, but his thinking is more advanced." This played a certain role in criticizing the complacency of some young workers and promoting the spirit of young workers to work hard, study diligently, and overcome difficulties.

While promoting Wang Chonglun, the East China "Youth Daily" also paid attention to promoting advanced producers among young workers in East China. Among them were: Xu Gang, an excellent Youth League member and foundry worker, who completed two months and ten days of work in one month due to diligently studying technology and creating the "multi-mold and multi-casting method" with the help of technicians and veteran workers, and improving the mud core bones; Zhang Lingdi, a young League member and female weaver, who had the confidence to overcome difficulties when work was difficult in the rainy season, and did not become paralyzed and slack when the work was easy at other times, and overfulfilled the plan every month for eleven months; and so on. The advanced producers and advanced deeds in the local area that are promoted in the newspaper make the readers feel more intimate. It is precisely because these advanced producers live among them and are familiar to them that they can powerfully overcome the concerns of some people that "advanced producers are good, but they cannot be learned from," and promote them to learn from these advanced figures.

Secondly, the East China "Youth Daily" also paid attention to promoting various auxiliary activities of the League to promote young workers to accept the General Line education unified by the Party. The newspaper's report on the Youth League Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Committee closely cooperating with the Party Committee's various educational steps to carry out various auxiliary activities that young people like is an example. When the Party Committee of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant strengthened everyone's confidence in taking the socialist road by carefully calculating accounts, making comparisons, and recalling the changes in the past four years, the Youth League Committee, according to the characteristics of most young workers who did not have a deep experience of the bitter life in the old society, in addition to educating young workers to seriously accept education from the recollections and comparisons of veteran workers, specially invited teacher Zhang Dexuan to tell young workers about the comparison of his two fingers. He said: "These two fingers of mine represent two different societies. Before liberation, I worked in the pseudo-Central Automobile Assembly Plant, and the finger bone of my middle finger was smashed. I paid for the treatment myself every day, and I was urged to go to work before the injury was healed; now this finger is completely disabled. After liberation, I accidentally injured my thumb and broke my finger bone. The factory immediately sent me to the hospital by car, and all medical expenses were paid by the factory." This recollection and comparison had a profound impact on young workers. They generally recalled and compared their past and present lives, and said: "I want to cry when I recall the past, and I laugh when I compare it with the present." In addition, the newspaper also reported that the League organization educated young workers to pay attention to the quality of products through various social contact activities in production, such as parties, communications, mutual visits, and so on. For example, when the Party organization of the Shanghai State-owned No. 12 Cotton Textile Factory set about solving the problem of poor product quality in the factory, the Youth League organization of the factory actively assisted the Party in solving this problem. The newspaper reported that the Youth League Committee of the factory organized League members and young workers in each workshop to conduct more than ten mutual visits between workshops, and then organized League members and young workers in the factory's cloth factory to visit the Fifth Printing and Dyeing Factory. During the visit, they saw that the oiled yarn produced by some League members and young workers in the twisting workshop caused the cloth factory to produce substandard cloth. Some League members and young workers in the cloth factory, in order to speed up the production, weaved cloth with yarn ends and burrs, which sometimes caught fire or were dyed badly when sent to the printing and dyeing factory for printing and dyeing, becoming defective products. Through the visit, they realized that good cloth requires everyone to operate carefully; if they do not produce well, it will also affect the quality of products from other related factories. Therefore, everyone promised to improve their sense of responsibility at work and improve product quality. Obviously, the newspaper's reports on such activities carried out according to the characteristics of young people can not only conduct ideological education for young workers vividly and specifically, so that they can further accept the General Line education unified by the Party Committee, but also powerfully promote production work.

Third, the East China "Youth Daily," based on the situation of young people "growing in knowledge and physique," combined the "three goods" instructed by Chairman Mao when conducting General Line education for young workers. The East China "Youth Daily" not only reflected the daily production and work of young people, but also reflected the issues of youth's rest, recreational sports, love, marriage, and "having a good day off." The newspaper reported on the situation of the Youth League General Branch Committee of the New Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant organizing young workers to have a good Sunday. The report said: Young workers feel that life is more interesting and they are more energetic in production. The newspaper also published a commentary, praising this practice, and pointed out that organizing young people's recreational sports activities is not only not contradictory to completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy, but can also make the task of increasing production and practicing economy better completed. Therefore, the League organization should put these two things on its work agenda at the same time. On the other hand, the newspaper also promptly educated some young workers who put recreational sports activities above production and learning, so that they dozed off at work and did not abide by labor discipline. In addition, the newspaper also used some typical examples to educate young workers to pay attention to economy and so on. Through these reports, the East China "Youth Daily" specifically pointed out to the League organizations in various places that the League organization should not only educate young workers to be good at work and study, but also educate them to be good at rest and good at handling other problems in life. This approach of the newspaper also shows that paying attention to conducting such comprehensive education for young workers is the responsibility of League organizations in various places, and it is also the responsibility of the League's newspapers.

Fourth, the East China "Youth Daily" also paid attention to adopting diverse propaganda forms that young people like when conducting General Line education for young workers, which is also an important reason for the effectiveness of this education. For example, the newspaper's recreational sports supplement, in various columns that promote specific issues, paid attention to using cartoons, photos, and illustrations to make the reports lively and interesting. In particular, the cartoons published are all taken from the daily life of young people, the content is true and vivid, and they can criticize and educate on the main problems in the current youth life. This makes the reports more inspiring and strengthens the guiding power of the newspaper.

However, the East China "Youth Daily" also has some shortcomings in this propaganda. For example, when reporting on various auxiliary activities of the League organization, it often only talks about the problem in isolation, and does not promote it to the height of political and ideological education to implement the General Line. In reflecting and guiding youth life, not enough attention is paid to how young workers should correctly handle their love and marriage and other issues. Sometimes there is also the shortcoming of not combining with the General Line and General Task, and simply discussing life issues without political and ideological education. These all need further improvement.

    华东“青年报”是怎样向青年工人进行总路线教育的
    立人
    向青年工人进行总路线的教育，是青年团的报纸在当前和今后长时期内一项重要的任务。为了深入进行总路线教育，团的报纸必须从青年工人的特点出发，针对他们普遍存在的思想问题进行宣传；并注意运用青年工人所喜爱的各种宣传形式。在这一方面，华东“青年报”所作的一些努力，是值得介绍的。
    华东“青年报”首先注意了先进生产者的宣传；其中又把宣传王崇伦作为向青年工人进行总路线教育，号召青年工人以实际行动贯彻总路线的一项重要内容。该报针对一般青年工人在技术学习上不够虚心，有成绩容易自满，遇到困难容易灰心等思想情况，发表了“只有永不自满，才能永远前进”、“天下无难事，只怕有心人”等文章。在前一篇文章中，青年工人陆有德检查他自己过去的自满思想说：“看见我去年第四季度月月超额完成计划，就觉得我们现在很好了，动脑筋、找窍门就不像过去那样常常放在心上。”但当他学习了王崇伦的模范事迹后，见到王崇伦虽然连续改进工具，仍不自满，终于又创造了万能工具胎，提高了工作效率六倍半，他认识到了王崇伦这种永不自满的精神，值得他好好学习。于是积极动脑筋，改进了工具，并且在老工人的帮助下，在做柴油机上的油泵顶头时增加了吃刀量，去年十二月提前十二天完成了生产任务。在后一篇文章中，青年工人陈修林检查说：他过去认为自己干的是零碎活，技术也不高，不能像王崇伦那样一年完成三年的工作量。（编者按：此处系指至去年十一月十八日，王崇伦所完成的工作量。）但在听了介绍王崇伦的模范事迹的报告后，才了解到“王崇伦的机器也并不是最好的，他也不是天生一手好本领，他能创造万能工具胎，也是靠他刻苦钻研，虚心学习得来的。”他下决心学习王崇伦的先进思想和工作精神。后来他冲滤油片时，在老工人的帮助下改进了工具，把产量提高了三倍。华东“青年报”用青年工人学习王崇伦改进自己工作的各种实际事例，来说明“王崇伦不是条件比别人好，是他的思想比别人先进”。这在批判一部分青年工人存在的自满情绪，发扬青年工人刻苦钻研、克服困难的精神方面，都是起了一定的作用的。
    华东“青年报”在宣传王崇伦的同时，又注意宣传了华东地区青年工人中间的先进生产者。其中有：由于刻苦钻研技术，并在技术人员和老工人的帮助下创造了“多型多铸法”，改进了泥心骨头等，因而一月完成二月零十天工作量的优秀青年团员、翻砂工徐刚；在多雨季节活难做时有信心克服困难，平时活好做时又不麻痹松懈，十一个月中月月超额完成计划的青年团员织布挡车女工章玲娣；等等。报纸上所宣传的本地区的先进生产者和先进事迹，就使读者感到更加亲切。也正因为这些先进生产者是生活在他们自己中间，并为他们所熟悉的，就能有力地克服一些人存在的“先进生产者好是好，可是学不到”的顾虑，推动他们来向这些先进人物学习。
    其次，华东“青年报”还注意宣传了团的各种辅助活动，来推动青年工人接受党所统一进行的总路线教育。该报关于青年团上海机床厂委员会密切配合党委的各个教育步骤，开展青年所喜爱的各种辅助活动的报道，就是一个例子。在上海机床厂党委通过算细账、对比、回忆四年来的变化，来坚定大家走社会主义道路的信心的时候，团委就根据大多数青年工人对旧社会的苦生活体验不深的特点，除了教育青年工人要他们认真从老工人的回忆对比中接受教育以外，又特别请了老师傅张德煊向青年工人讲了关于他的两个手指的对比。他说：“我这两个手指，代表了两个不同的社会。解放前，我在伪中央汽车装配厂做工，中指指骨砸碎了，天天自己出钱去医治，伤还没有好就被催去上工；现在这个手指七弯八曲的完全残废了。解放后，我不当心大姆指受了伤，指骨断了，厂里立即用汽车把我送到医院里，医药费用全由厂里负责。”这一回忆对比对青年工人的影响很深，他们普遍地回忆对比了过去和现在的生活，并且说：“回忆过去要哭，比比现在就笑。”另外，该报也报道了团的组织通过生产上的各种社会联系活动，如联欢、通讯、相互参观等等，来教育青年工人重视产品的质量。如上海国营第十二棉纺织厂的党组织着手解决该厂产品质量差的问题时，该厂的青年团组织就积极地协助党来解决这个问题。报纸报道团的这次辅助活动时说：该厂团委会组织各车间团员和青年工人在各车间相互进行了十多次参观以后，又组织该厂布厂的团员和青年工人去第五印染厂参观。参观中他们看见由于捻线间有的团员和青年工人出了沾油的纱，就使布厂出了次布。而布厂有的团员和青年工人贪快织出了带纱头毛边的布，送去印染厂印染时，有时烧了起来，有时染得不好看，成了次品。他们通过参观，认识到好布是需要每个人细心操作的；如果自己生产不好，也影响其他有关厂的产品的质量。因而大家保证要提高工作责任心，改进产品质量。显然，报纸报道了这一类根据青年特点所开展的各种活动，既能生动具体地向青年工人进行思想教育，使他们能够进一步接受党委所统一进行的总路线教育，同时也有力地推动了生产工作。
    第三、华东“青年报”根据青年人“长知识、长身体”的情况，在向青年工人进行总路线教育时，又结合毛主席指示的“三好”进行了宣传。华东 “青年报”不只是反映了青年每天的生产和工作，还反映了青年的休息、文娱体育、恋爱婚姻，以及“过好休息天”等问题。该报报道了新沪钢铁厂团总支委员会组织青年工人过好星期天的情况。报道中说：青年工人们感到生活更有了趣味，生产也有了劲。报纸还发表评论，表扬了这种做法，并指出：组织青年们的文娱体育活动，不但与完成增产节约的任务不矛盾，并且可以使增产节约的任务完成得更好。因此团的组织应该把这两件事，同时放到自己的工作日程表上去。另一方面，报纸又针对部分青年工人把文娱体育活动放在生产、学习之上，以致上班打瞌睡，不遵守劳动纪律的偏向，及时地进行了教育。此外，报纸也运用一些典型事例，教育青年工人注意节约等等。华东“青年报”通过这些报道，具体地向各地团的组织指明：团的组织既要教育青年工人善于工作和学习，也要教育他们善于休息和善于处理生活中的其他问题。该报的这种做法也表明，注意向青年工人进行这样的全面教育，是各地团组织的责任，同时也是团的报纸的责任。
  第四、华东“青年报”在向青年工人进行总路线教育时，还注意采用了多样的为青年所喜爱的宣传形式，这也是使这一教育取得效果的一个重要原因。例如该报的文娱体育副刊版，在针对某些具体问题进行宣传的各个专栏内，都注意运用漫画、照片和插图，使得报道内容生动有趣。特别是所发表的漫画，都是取材自青年的日常生活，内容真实生动，并能针对当前青年生活中的主要问题进行批评和教育。这就使得报道更富于鼓动性，加强了报纸的指导力量。
    但是，华东“青年报”在这一宣传中，也还存在一些缺点。例如，在报道团组织的各种辅助活动时，常常是就问题谈问题，没有提高到贯彻总路线的政治思想教育高度来宣传。在反映和指导青年生活方面，对青年工人如何正确地处理自己的恋爱婚姻等问题，还注意得不够。有时又有不与总路线总任务相结合，离开政治思想教育来单纯谈生活问题的缺点。这些还都有待进一步的改进。
