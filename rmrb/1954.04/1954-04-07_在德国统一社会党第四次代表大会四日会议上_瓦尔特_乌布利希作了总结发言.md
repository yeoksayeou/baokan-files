At the Fourth Session of the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany,
Walter Ulbricht Delivers Concluding Speech

At the Fourth Session of the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, delivered a concluding speech.

In his speech, Ulbricht emphasized that the criticism and self-criticism made during the discussion of the summary report of the Party Central Committee showed that the Party had grown stronger and that it was constantly fighting for new and progressive things, against the old, decadent, and reactionary bourgeois ideological influences. Ulbricht pointed out that no congress had aroused such a wide response throughout Germany and the world as this congress, which discussed how to peacefully resolve the vital issues of the German nation.

After pointing out the significance of the Soviet government's statement on the relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht emphasized that every German patriot would understand the great role that this decision played in the cause of rebuilding a unified, democratic Germany. This decision will inevitably strengthen the patriotic movement of the people in West Germany and West Berlin and promote the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany. A broad prospect of building a unified, peace-loving, democratic Germany that is equal to other countries is unfolding before the German people.

Ulbricht mentioned a sentence in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: Because the German Democratic Republic consistently and unswervingly implements a policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries, it has gained its due position in the camp of peace and democracy. Ulbricht said that the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made us feel very honored. We request Comrades Mikoyan, Suslov, Shepilov, and Smirnov to convey our gratitude to the Central Committee of the CPSU. We thank it for its constant fraternal assistance and trust in us. (Applause) We will tirelessly strengthen the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Germany, and protect it like the apple of our eye, because this friendship is the premise for the victory of the peace-loving forces of the German people in their struggle to restore the unity of the motherland and transform their country into a democratic one. We tell the representatives of the fraternal parties that we will be loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, strengthen international solidarity with the working classes of all countries, and contribute our strength to the common struggle for world peace.

Ulbricht went on to point out that some representatives of the U.S. occupation authorities had issued statements on the Soviet government's statement on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. Ulbricht said: Mr. Conant, the U.S. High Commissioner, said that the implementation of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty would also seem to give West Germany sovereignty. (Laughter) It is noteworthy that the residents of the German Democratic Republic and the vast majority of residents of West Germany welcomed the Soviet government's statement on its relations with the German Democratic Republic, while the aforementioned statement by Mr. Conant was not welcomed by anyone, not even in West Germany. (Applause)

Regarding the relationship between the German Democratic Republic and other countries, Ulbricht said: We have stated that military representatives of the former Allied Control Council who do not have normal relations with the German Democratic Republic shall not operate within the territory of the German Democratic Republic, and some Western forces are dissatisfied with this proposition of ours. Some foreign representatives say that the German Democratic Republic cannot interfere in the affairs of the Western military authorities. However, these gentlemen should understand that matters on German territory must be decided by the Germans. (Stormy applause)

Ulbricht continued, the main obstacles on the road to a unified Germany are the "European Defense Community" treaty and the Bonn Treaty. The fact that the German Democratic Republic has gained sovereignty points out a path for the preparation of an all-German peace treaty to all the German people. This strengthens the desire of the people in West Germany to demand national self-determination. The people of West Germany see that in addition to the Bonn and Paris military treaties, in addition to succumbing to the will of foreign billionaires and militarists, there is another way: to stop the establishment of the "European Defense Community", to grant West Germany sovereignty, to withdraw foreign occupying forces according to Molotov's proposal, and for Germans to reach an agreement to establish a temporary all-German government and hold truly free and democratic all-German elections. (Applause)

Ulbricht proposed that the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the West German Parliament jointly pass a resolution requesting a ban on atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. He said, we hope that such a proposal for a joint decision by the East and West German parliaments will be supported by all peace-loving people in West Germany, and we hope to launch a broad mass movement to support this demand. (Applause)

Ulbricht then spoke about the West German Social Democratic Party's position on militarization policies, emphasizing that it is necessary to strengthen the united action of the West German working class and all peace-loving people to stop the conspiracies of the militarists.

Ulbricht then talked about the relationship between the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, saying that establishing economic relations between East and West Germany is one of the ways to normalize the relationship between the two parts of Germany and bring them closer to each other. During the discussion, workers in West Germany pointed out that coal production in West Germany has decreased due to insufficient sales markets, and large-scale layoffs have begun in the coal mining industry. Orders in the metallurgical industry are also decreasing. Workers from the Ruhr asked us: Why don't you buy more? Our answer is: We are willing to buy more. But because West Germany is not an independent country, and there are Americans and the European Coal and Steel Community interfering there, this hinders the development of normal trade between West Germany and the German Democratic Republic. If normal economic relations were established between West Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and if cooperation was established in diplomatic affairs, then West German industry would be able to obtain a large number of orders, eliminate unemployment, and not need to reduce working days. (Applause)

Ulbricht mentioned that some members of the German Communist Party said during the discussion of the summary report of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany that they would concentrate all their efforts on mobilizing the people to fight against the "European Defense Community" and against the revival of West German militarism, which is correct. Ulbricht also said that Communist Party members should strengthen their work in West German trade unions.

Ulbricht turned to the domestic situation of the German Democratic Republic, pointing out that the delegates reported in the discussions the significant achievements made by the working people of the Republic in various sectors of the national economy. These achievements show that the path taken by the German Democratic Republic is correct, and that greater achievements can be made in developing its economy and improving the living standards of the working people. Ulbricht then described in detail the issues of industry, agriculture, and supplying residents with food and consumer goods mentioned in the discussion.

Ulbricht paid special attention to the issue of Party life and the political education of the working people. Ulbricht quoted a sentence from A.I. Mikoyan's congratulatory message to the Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: The historical mission of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is first and foremost: it should lead the German people to permanently stay away from the path of military disaster and embark on the path of peaceful development. Ulbricht said: Fulfilling this mission is in the interests of the German working class and the interests of the entire German people. Therefore, it is necessary to closely link the Party with the broadest working people, and to attract young people to participate in the struggle against the Bonn and Paris military treaties. This is a top priority task.

Ulbricht concluded by saying that we advocate a unified Germany because the Germans living in the western part of our motherland are our brothers, because we love our motherland, and because we know that restoring German unity is an inevitable law of historical development. Those who attempt to violate this law will perish. (Applause) We Germans declare to all peace-loving people in the world that German militarism has launched two world wars. Militarism has been eradicated in the German Democratic Republic, and in West Germany, the working class and peace-loving people have also launched a resistance movement against the revival of German militarism. Therefore, there is every possibility to prevent the outbreak of a third world war. ... The greatest wish of the German people is that the four major powers can finally conclude a peace treaty with Germany in order to help the rapid conclusion of a "Pan-European Treaty to Ensure Collective Security in Europe." (Applause) If all peaceful forces can act in unison in this direction, we can achieve the great goal – safeguarding peace. At that time, Germany will obtain a peace treaty, the occupying forces will withdraw from Germany, an all-German government will be formed, which will prepare for truly free and democratic all-German elections, and finally a unified, democratic and peace-loving Germany will be established. (Applause)

Long live peace!
Down with German militarism!
Long live the united action of the entire German working class against the "European Defense Community", for a peace treaty, and for the withdrawal of the occupying forces!
Long live the fraternal cooperation of the people of all countries!
Long live the fraternal cooperation of all German workers!
Long live the fraternal cooperation of all peaceful forces for the prosperity of our motherland and for the happy future of our people! (Stormy and prolonged applause)

    在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会四日会议上
    瓦尔特·乌布利希作了总结发言
    在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会四日会议上，党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希作了总结发言。
    乌布利希在发言中着重指出：在讨论党中央委员会的总结报告时所进行的批评与自我批评表明：党壮大起来了，它在为争取新的、进步的东西，反对旧的、陈腐的东西和反动的资产阶级思想的影响进行着经常的斗争。乌布利希指出：没有任何一次代表大会像讨论如何和平解决德意志民族的切身重要问题的这次代表大会这样在整个德国和全世界引起如此广泛的反应。
    乌布利希在指出了苏联政府关于苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系的声明的意义后，强调指出：德国的每一个爱国者都会了解，苏联的这一决定在重建一个统一的、民主的德国的事业中是具有何等重大的作用。这一决定必然会加强西德和西柏林的人民爱国运动，并促使德国两部分接近。在德国人民面前展开着建立一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的和与其他国家平等的德国的广阔的前景。
    乌布利希提到苏联共产党中央委员会给德国统一社会党第四次代表大会的贺词中的一句话：由于德意志民主共和国一贯地和坚持不渝地执行和平及与各国人民友好的政策，它在和平民主阵营中获得了应有的地位。乌布利希说道，苏联共产党中央委员会的贺词使我们感到很大的光荣。我们请求米高扬、苏斯洛夫、谢皮洛夫、斯米尔诺夫同志向苏共中央转达我们的谢意，我们感谢它经常给我们以兄弟般的援助及对我们的信任。（掌声）我们将要不倦地加强德苏两国人民的友谊，要像保护眼珠一样地保护它，因为这种友谊是德国人民爱好和平的力量在为恢复祖国的统一及改造自己的国家成为一个民主的国家而进行的斗争中取得胜利的前提。我们向兄弟党的代表表示：我们将忠于无产阶级国际主义原则，将加强与各国工人阶级的国际团结并在争取世界和平的共同斗争中贡献我们的力量。
    乌布利希接着指出，美国占领当局的某些代表就苏联政府对苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系所作的声明发表了声明。乌布利希说：美国高级专员康南特先生说，“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约的实现似乎也能使西德得到主权。（全场大笑）值得注意的是：德意志民主共和国的居民和西德的绝大多数居民都欢迎苏联政府关于和德意志民主共和国的关系的声明，而前面所提到的康南特先生的声明却没有任何人欢迎，甚至在西德也没有人欢迎。　（掌声）
    关于德意志民主共和国和其他国家的关系问题，乌布利希说：我们曾声明，前盟国管制委员会的军事代表，凡是各该国与德意志民主共和国没有建立正常关系者，不得在德意志民主共和国境内活动，西方某些势力对我们的这一主张不满。外国的某些代表说，德意志民主共和国不能干预西方军事当局的事务。但是，这些先生应当明白，在德国领土上的事情，得由德国人决定。　（暴风雨般的掌声）
    乌布利希继续说，统一德国道路上的主要障碍是“欧洲防务集团”条约和波恩条约。德意志民主共和国获得主权的事实向全体德国人民指出了一条准备全德和约的道路。这在西德加强了人民要求民族自决权的愿望。西德人民看到，除了波恩和巴黎军事条约之外，除了屈从于外国亿万富翁和军国主义者的意志之外，还有另外一条道路，这条道路就是：阻止建立“欧洲防务集团”，给予西德主权，根据莫洛托夫的建议撤退外国占领军，德国人之间达成协议以成立临时的全德政府和举行真正自由的、民主的全德选举。　（掌声）
    乌布利希建议，由德意志民主共和国人民议院和西德议会共同通过一个决议，要求禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器。他说，我们希望，这样一个关于东、西德议会共同采取决定的建议将得到西德所有爱好和平的人民的支持，我们希望展开一个广泛的群众运动来支持这一要求。　（掌声）
    乌布利希接着谈到西德社会民主党对军国主义化政策所采取的立场，他着重指出，必须加强西德工人阶级和所有爱好和平人民的一致行动，以制止军国主义者的阴谋。
    乌布利希接着谈到德意志民主共和国和西德之间的关系，他说，东、西德之间建立经济关系，是使德国两部分之间的关系正常化、使德国两部分互相接近的道路之一。在讨论过程中，西德的工人指出：在西德，煤的开采量由于销售市场不够而减少了，采煤工业中已开始大批解雇工人。冶金工业中的订货也日益减少。从鲁尔来的工人向我们提出了这样一个问题：为什么你们不多买一些？我们的回答是：我们愿意多买一些。但是由于西德不是一个独立的国家，在那里有美国人和欧洲煤钢联营集团在进行干涉，这就阻碍了西德和德意志民主共和国之间的正常贸易的发展。如果西德与德意志民主共和国之间建立了正常的经济关系，如果在外交方面建立了合作，那末，西德工业就能够获得大批的订货单，使失业现象不存在，不需要减少工作日。
  （鼓掌）
    乌布利希提到一些德国共产党党员在讨论德国统一社会党中央委员会的总结报告时谈到，他们要集中全力发动人民为反对“欧洲防务集团”和反对复活西德军国主义而斗争，这是正确的。乌布利希又说，共产党党员应加强对西德工会进行工作。
    乌布利希转而谈到德意志民主共和国的国内情况，他指出，代表们在讨论中纷纷报告了共和国的劳动人民在国民经济各部门取得的重大成就。这些成就说明了，德意志民主共和国所走的道路是正确的，并且在发展自己的经济和提高劳动人民的生活水平方面可以取得更大的成就。乌布利希然后详细地叙述了讨论中所提到的工业、农业、供应居民以食品和消费品的问题。
    乌布利希特别注意党内生活问题和对劳动人民进行政治教育的问题。乌布利希引用了阿·伊·米高扬在德国统一社会党代表大会上所作贺词中的一句话：德国统一社会党的历史性的使命首先是：它应该领导德国人民永远脱离军事灾难的道路，而走上和平发展的道路。乌布利希说道：执行这一使命是符合于德国工人阶级的利益和全体德国人民的利益的。因此，必须使党与最广泛的劳动人民紧密地联系起来，吸引青年们参加反对波恩与巴黎军事条约的斗争，这是一项头等重要的任务。
    乌布利希最后说，我们主张统一德国，因为住在我们祖国西部的德国人是我们的兄弟，因为我们爱自己的祖国，因为我们知道恢复德国统一是必然的历史发展规律。那些企图违反这种规律的人是要遭到灭亡的。（掌声）我们德国人向世界上所有爱好和平的人们声明：德国军国主义曾经掀起两次世界大战。在德意志民主共和国已根绝了军国主义，而在西德，工人阶级和爱好和平的人民也展开了反对德国军国主义复活的抵抗运动。因此，有一切可能来防止第三次世界大战的爆发。……德国人民最大的愿望，是四大国能最后缔结对德和约，以便有助于迅速缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”。
  （掌声）如果一切和平力量能朝这个方向一致行动起来，我们就能达到伟大的目标——保障和平。那时，德国将获得和约，占领军将撤离德国，将组成全德政府，由它来准备真正自由、民主的全德选举，并且最后将建立一个统一、民主与爱好和平的德国。　（掌声）
    和平万岁！
    打倒德国军国主义！
    德国全体工人阶级为反对“欧洲防务集团”、争取缔结和约、争取撤退占领军而一致行动万岁！
    各国人民兄弟般的合作万岁！
    全德工人兄弟般的合作万岁！
      一切和平力量为我们祖国的繁荣、为我国人民的幸福前途而进行兄弟般的合作万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
