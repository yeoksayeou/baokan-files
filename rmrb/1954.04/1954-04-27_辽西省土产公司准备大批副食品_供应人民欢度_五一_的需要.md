    Liaoxi Province Native Produce Company Prepares Large Quantities of Non-Staple Foods
    To Supply People's Needs for Celebrating "May Day"
    The Liaoxi Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company is actively preparing various non-staple foods to ensure that the people in cities and industrial and mining areas can happily celebrate International Labor Day on May 1st.
    In early March, the company sent ten cadres in three groups to Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou to purchase non-staple foods that were lacking locally. They have now purchased a large quantity of dried vegetables, seafood, etc. At the same time, through the native produce company organizations in Jinzhou, Siping, Fuxin, Jinxi and other cities and counties, 5,400 live pigs, 1,700 cattle, and 1.2 million eggs have been prepared, and procurement is continuing. The variety of non-staple foods has also increased by more than 30 compared to last year. In addition to meeting the needs of major cities and industrial and mining areas in Liaoxi Province, these non-staple foods can also be allocated to Shenyang and Anshan for a portion of live pigs and eggs. To facilitate workers and others to buy goods, the company also instructed grassroots units to set up temporary meat stalls during the holiday. (Cui Qingcheng)

    供应人民欢度“五一”的需要
    中国土产公司辽西省公司积极准备各种副食品，保证城市和工矿区人民欢度“五一”劳动节。
    在三月初旬，该公司即派出十名干部组成三个小组分赴天津、上海、汉口采购当地缺乏的副食品，现已购进大批干菜、海味等。同时通过锦州、四平、阜新、锦西等市、县的土产公司机构，准备了五千四百头活猪，一千七百头牛，一百二十万个鸡蛋，并正继续进行收购。副食品品种，也比去年增加了三十多种。这些副食品，除可供辽西省主要城市和工矿区的需要外，还可调剂给沈阳、鞍山一部分活猪和鸡蛋。为便利工人等买货，该公司还指示基层单位可在节日增设临时肉床。（崔庆成）
