Shaanxi Province's farmers are working intensely on cotton planting preparations to achieve this year's goal of increasing cotton production by more than 12 million catties.

Shaanxi Province produced over 170 million catties of cotton last year, an increase of more than 17% compared to the previous year. This year, there are plans to increase production by another 7.6% compared to last year. If this increase is fully realized, the province's total cotton production will reach over 180 million catties.

Since the beginning of spring, many agricultural production cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams in cotton-producing areas have established cotton production increase plans focused on improving the yield per unit area of cotton fields. Counties such as Yulin, Qingjian, Chenggu, and Nanzheng have expanded their cotton fields by more than 40,000 mu without affecting grain production. Some individual farmers in the Guanzhong area are also appropriately expanding their cotton planting area, led by local mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

Currently, farmers in the Guanzhong Plain are harrowing and preserving soil moisture, transporting base fertilizer to over three million mu of cotton fields, and treating seeds with Ceresan on 1.25 million mu of land before sowing. This year, the northern and southern cotton areas of Shaanxi plan to promote and breed 200,000 catties of improved varieties such as "Jingsi Cotton." Cotton fields in the Jinghui and Luhui irrigation areas have begun to be irrigated, ensuring timely sowing of cotton. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have prepared 8 million catties of chemical fertilizers and more than 12,000 pieces of new-style agricultural implements such as cotton strip seeders, sprayers, and three-pronged weeding hoes for farmers in cotton-producing areas.

    陕西省今年将增产皮棉一千二百多万斤
    陕西省农民为实现今年增产皮棉一千二百多万斤的任务，正紧张地进行植棉准备工作。
    陕西省去年产皮棉一亿七千多万斤，比前年增产百分之十七以上。今年又计划比去年增产百分之七点六。这个增产计划如全部实现，将使全省棉花总产量达到一亿八千多万斤。
    入春以来，产棉区的许多农业生产合作社和常年互助组纷纷订立以提高棉田单位面积产量为主要内容的棉花增产计划。榆林、清涧、城固、南郑等县在不影响增产粮食的情况下，扩大了四万多亩棉田。关中地区的部分单干农民也在当地互助合作组织的带动下，适当扩大了种棉面积。
    现在，关中平原的农民正在三百多万亩棉田上耙耱保墒、运送底肥，并在播种前用赛力散把一百二十五万亩地的种子进行了拌种。陕西北部和南部棉区，今年计划推广和繁殖“泾斯棉”等优良品种二十万斤。泾惠、洛惠灌溉区的棉田已开始放水灌溉，保证棉田的适时播种。各级供销合作社已给棉产区的农民准备了八百万斤化学肥料和一万二千多件棉花条播机、喷雾器、三齿耘锄等新式农具。
