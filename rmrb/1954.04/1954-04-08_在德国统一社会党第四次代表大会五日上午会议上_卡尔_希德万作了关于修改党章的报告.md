    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th (TASS): At the morning session on the 5th of the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Karl Schirdewan, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Party, delivered a report on the revision of the Party Statute of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
    Schirdewan said that since the Third Party Congress, the Party has undergone many struggles, achieved great victories, and withstood many severe tests. The reason why the Party was able to achieve great victories and withstand the tests was because the Party not only had correct policies but also carried out correct organizational work in implementing policy guidelines. In its party-building work, the Party followed the basic organizational principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    Schirdewan then pointed out that some of the provisions in the Party Statute adopted by the Third Party Congress have become outdated and need to be revised, and some provisions need to be written more precisely.
    Schirdewan mentioned some changes that have taken place in the working class of the German Democratic Republic itself (during this period): they have already possessed most of the means of production, and most of them have been freed from exploitation. The working class has already taken a leading position in society. Under the influence of the working class, the countryside has embarked on the road of agricultural collectivization, which is developing year by year. The alliance between the working class and the intellectuals is increasingly consolidated. The leading and organizing role of the Party as the leading revolutionary force and transforming force of society is being increasingly enhanced.
    Schirdewan pointed out that the current task of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is to make the entire German working class have a clear understanding of its own development, so that they realize that only by uniting around the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin can the working class shoulder the historical mission of being the standard-bearer of building a new society. He said that the introduction of the Party Statute affirmed the most important achievement of the Party, namely: the establishment of the worker-peasant alliance. The worker-peasant alliance has become the unshakable foundation of the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic.
    He then talked about the content of the draft revised Party Statute. He said that the Party's responsibility for the future development of Germany is increasing day by day. The responsibility of each Party member in completing the Party's instructions and consolidating the Party and state discipline is also increasing. Therefore, as stipulated in the old Party Statute, it is not enough to only require Party members to recognize the Party Program and Party Statute and to obey the Party's resolutions. The first article of the Party Statute should stipulate that each Party member has the responsibility to actively strive to realize the Party's policies and resolutions.
    When talking about the obligations of Party members, Schirdewan particularly emphasized that Party members must abide by the discipline of the Party and the state. Party members must be loyal and honest and especially vigilant against the enemies of the Party. He pointed out that one of the important tasks of Party members is to constantly strengthen ties with the broad masses of the working people.
    When talking about the issue of criticism and self-criticism, Schirdewan said that the old Party Statute only stipulated that Party members have the right to criticize, while the new draft Party Statute stipulates that each Party member has the obligation to carry out criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top without regard for face. He then said that the new draft Party Statute attaches great importance to the rights of Party members and the development of inner-Party democracy. He pointed out that the principle of collective leadership is a decisive factor in further developing inner-Party democracy and strengthening the Party's political leadership.
    Schirdewan said that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany plays a leading role in the social organizations and state organs of the German Democratic Republic, and therefore Party members should constantly improve their theoretical and political level, as stipulated in the draft Party Statute.
    The draft Party Statute adds a new chapter: "The Party and the Free German Youth League," which emphasizes the role of the Party in cultivating members of the Free German Youth League, because the Free German Youth League is the Party's assistant and reserve force.
    Schirdewan talked about the need to raise vigilance in the selection of cadres.
    Schirdewan said that between the two congresses, the Central Committee is the highest organ of the Party and possesses all power, and the strength, prestige, and correctness of the Central Committee's leadership are based on its firm collectivity. According to the proposal of Wilhelm Pieck, the Politburo unanimously adopted a resolution recommending that the Party Congress abolish the provision stipulated in the current Party Statute for electing two chairmen of the Party at the congress. This proposal is to enhance the role of the Central Committee and its Politburo.
    After a heated discussion on Schirdewan's report, the Congress unanimously adopted the revised Party Statute. The Congress also unanimously adopted the programmatic document of the Congress: "The Road to Solving the Vital Problems of the German Nation."

    在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会五日上午会议上
    卡尔·希德万作了关于修改党章的报告
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会五日上午的会议上，党中央委员会政治局委员卡尔·希德万作了关于修改德国统一社会党党章的报告。
    希德万说，从第三次党代表大会以来，党进行了许多斗争，取得了巨大的胜利并经过许多严重的考验。党所以能够取得巨大的胜利、经得住考验，是因为党不仅有正确的政策，而且在执行政策方针时进行了正确的组织工作。党在建党工作中，遵循了马克思—列宁主义的基本组织原则。
    希德万接着指出，第三次党代表大会所通过的党章中的某些条款已经失去时效，需要加以修改，有些条款需要写得更确切。
    希德万提到德意志民主共和国工人阶级本身
  （在这一时期内）所发生的一些变化：他们已经占有了大部分生产资料，他们之中的大部分已经摆脱了剥削。工人阶级在社会中已经居于领导地位。在工人阶级的影响下，农村走上了农业合作化的道路，一年比一年发展。工人阶级和知识分子的联盟日益巩固。作为社会的领导革命力量和改造力量的党的领导和组织作用正在日益提高。
    希德万指出，德国统一社会党当前的任务是使德国整个工人阶级对自己的发展有明确的认识，使他们认识到，只有团结在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说的周围，工人阶级才能担当起建立新社会的旗手这一历史使命。他说，在党章引言内肯定了党的最重要的一项成就，即：工农联盟的建立。工农联盟已成为德意志民主共和国民主制度的不可动摇的基础。
    他接着谈到了修改后的党章草案的内容。他说，现在党对德国今后发展所负的责任日益加重。每个党员在完成党的指令、巩固党和国家的纪律方面的责任也随着加重。因此，如旧党章所规定的那样，仅要求党员承认党纲党章和服从党的决议，已不够了。在党章第一条就应当规定，每个党员有积极努力实现党的政策和决议的责任。
    在谈到党员的义务时，希德万特别强调，党员必须遵守党和国家的纪律。党员必须忠诚老实、对党的敌人特别警惕。他指出，党员的重大任务之一是经常加强和广大劳动人民群众的联系。
    谈到批评和自我批评的问题时，希德万说，旧党章只规定党员有批评的权利，而新党章草案规定，每个党员有不顾情面地自下而上地开展批评和自我批评的义务。他接着说，新党章草案很重视党员的权利和发展党内民主。他指出，集体领导原则在进一步发展党内民主和加强党的政治领导中是一个决定性的因素。
    希德万说，德国统一社会党在德意志民主共和国的社会组织和国家机关中起着领导作用，因而党员应该经常提高自己的理论水平和政治水平，如党章草案所规定的那样。
    党章草案增添新的一章：“党与自由德国青年联盟”，这一章强调指出党在培养自由德国青年联盟盟员方面的作用，因为自由德国青年联盟是党的助手与后备军。
    希德万谈到必须在选择干部问题上提高警惕性。
    希德万谈到，在两次代表大会之间，中央委员会就是党的最高机关，并拥有一切权力，中央委员会领导的力量、威信及其正确性是以其坚定的集体性为基础的。根据威廉·皮克的建议，政治局一致通过一项决议，建议党代表大会取消现行党章所规定的在代表大会上选举党的两个主席的规定。这个建议是为了提高中央委员会及其政治局的作用。
    大会在就希德万的报告展开热烈的讨论以后，一致通过修改后的党章。大会并一致通过了代表大会纲领性的文件：“解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路”。
