Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 21st: The "Report on the Obstruction and Restriction of the Activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams by the United Nations Command" submitted by the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Military Armistice Commission.

    The first part of the report, based on the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement, explains the main problems faced in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The report points out: "One of the main tasks of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission established under the Armistice Agreement is to supervise, observe, and inspect whether the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army or the United Nations Command are introducing reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into Korea. In order to stabilize the armistice and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Armistice Agreement explicitly prohibits the entry of materials of this nature into Korea." The report points out: "The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has received fully cooperative and favorable conditions from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which has resulted in the effective inspections by its inspection teams at various ports in the north; however, its experience with the United Nations Command in this matter has been very unsatisfactory since the beginning of the armistice. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has dealt with accusations from the neutral nations inspection teams in the southern ports at almost all of its meetings, alleging that the United Nations Command in those locations has not only failed to actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the neutral nations inspection teams in carrying out their work, but has even restricted, obstructed, and violated the activities of the neutral nations inspection teams stationed there." The report points out: Due to the restrictions, obstructions, and violations of the activities of the neutral nations inspection teams by the U.S. side, "the experience of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission over the past eight months or more has shown that under the current circumstances, the teams are unable to carry out effective observation and inspection in the United Nations Command area."

    The second part of the report lists many facts exposing the U.S. side's restrictions, obstructions, and violations of the activities of the neutral nations inspection teams in South Korea. The report points out: "In order for the neutral nations inspection teams stationed at various ports to effectively supervise and inspect replacements, Article 43 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that such neutral nations inspection teams shall be given full freedom of movement within their respective port areas." The report also points out: "The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission believes that the right of neutral nations inspection teams to board ships is very important and necessary for effective supervision and inspection, and the Commission has instructed the neutral nations inspection teams accordingly. However, in a letter dated October 6, the United Nations Command prohibited the neutral nations inspection teams from boarding ships in all southern ports," "even when there is no other way and possibility to supervise and inspect the entry and exit of materials restricted by the Armistice Agreement, the teams are not allowed to board ships." The report points out: "Due to the above-mentioned interference by the United Nations Command, ships at various ports have been placed outside of supervision and inspection." Among the five South Korean ports listed in the Armistice Agreement, Incheon, Busan, Gangneung, and Gunsan are located on the coast.

    The report points out: The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can cite many examples of inaccurate, delayed, and even unreported reports by the U.S. side regarding the movement of combat aircraft. For example, the Daegu Neutral Nations Inspection Team was unable to inspect 118 combat aircraft in January, and as many as 205 combat aircraft in March. The situation in other ports is even more shocking. In March 1954, out of the 133 combat aircraft replaced through the port of Incheon, 125 were not reported to the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team in a timely manner.

    The report says: "There are many examples in Busan and Incheon where the United Nations Command refused to allow the neutral nations inspection teams to open boxes for inspection. For example, in Incheon, the representatives of the port authorities did not allow the neutral nations inspection teams to inspect the contents of the boxes found in the port. Placing the boxes outside of inspection in this way is another action by the United Nations Command to interfere with the work of the neutral nations inspection teams." The report points out: "The neutral nations inspection teams cannot conduct sufficient inspections at various ports, and therefore cannot guarantee that reinforcing combat materials restricted by the Armistice Agreement have not been transported into Korea." The report points out that the U.S. side even openly violated the Armistice Agreement by prohibiting the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team from entering the port on January 20 and 21 to perform its duties. The report points out: "This interference by the United Nations Command is a serious violation of the Armistice Agreement."

    The report exposes that the U.S. side used deceptive and concealed methods to obstruct the work of the neutral nations inspection teams, thereby transporting in large quantities of reinforcing combat materials. The report points out: "According to the agreement concluded by both parties on September 28, reports on each batch of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition that each party imports or withdraws from Korea for replacement purposes should be submitted to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission daily, no later than ten days after their import or withdrawal from Korea. Almost one-third of all reports submitted by the United Nations Command to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission were corrected afterward, even as late as 167 days later, and sometimes a single report was corrected and supplemented three, four, or even six times." "It must be noted that the materials and figures changed in the corrected reports in the first half of February and March 1954 involved dozens of combat aircraft and armored vehicles, hundreds of machine guns and submachine guns, dozens of rocket launchers, thousands of rifles, and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition. It must be noted that the United Nations Command only sent the corrected reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission after it had obtained the details of the above-mentioned materials reported by the neutral nations inspection teams."

    The report exposes that the U.S. side increased its military strength in Korea by not reporting the sub-types of combat materials with different performance characteristics. The report points out: The United Nations Command refused to report the sub-types of combat materials. "As early as November 10, 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission negotiated with the Military Armistice Commission to have the United Nations Command report the sub-types of all combat aircraft used for replacement during the first three months of the armistice. However, to date, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has not received any further information from the United Nations Command regarding this matter. In this situation, the neutral nations inspection teams have encountered many difficulties in conducting effective supervision, especially because the United Nations Command is transporting combat aircraft of higher performance sub-types into Korea to replace combat aircraft of lower performance sub-types."

    The report points out: The U.S. side even committed acts of assault and insult against the personnel of the neutral nations inspection teams, such as the assault on the Swedish secretary of the Daegu team, Larsson, the open abduction of the Polish personnel of the Gangneung team, Hadukiewicz, and the attempted similar acts against the Polish personnel of the Incheon team, Jagielnicki. The report points out: "These repeated acts are not only deliberate obstructions to the neutral nations inspection teams in performing their duties, but also serious insults to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission."

    The third part of the report points out: "The inspection and observation activities of the neutral nations inspection teams have been restricted, obstructed, and violated by the United Nations Command, and this situation is becoming increasingly serious, because at the same time, the neutral nations inspection teams in the southern ports have sent a large number of reports saying that the United Nations Command is transporting reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into Korea, and repeatedly violating the provisions of item M of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement." The report concludes: "The Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission fully recognize this situation, and therefore believe that it is their responsibility to report the facts to the Military Armistice Commission. The Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, considering the serious consequences of the continuous deterioration of the current situation on the stability of the Korean armistice, therefore believe that it is necessary to request the United Nations Command of the Military Armistice Commission to immediately take measures to stop the restrictions and obstructions, so that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams can conduct effective supervision and inspection in the southern ports as required by the Armistice Agreement."

    关于联合国军方面阻挠与限制中立国视察小组活动的报告（摘要）
    【新华社开城二十一日电】中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员向军事停战委员会提出的“关于联合国军方面阻挠与限制中立国视察小组活动的报告”。
    报告的第一部分根据停战协定中有关的规定，说明了中立国监察委员会工作中所面临的主要问题。报告指出：“根据停战协定而成立的中立国监察委员会的主要任务之一是监督、观察和视察朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面或联合国军方面是否没有在将增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药运入朝鲜。为了稳定停战以达成朝鲜问题的和平解决，停战协定明确禁止此种性质的物资进入朝鲜。”报告指出：“中立国监察委员会从朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面得到了充分合作的有利条件，结果就使其在北方各口岸的视察小组得以进行有效的视察；但它在这件事上从联合国军方面得到的经验却是自从停战一开始就是非常不能令人满意的。中立国监察委员会几乎在其所有的会议上都在处理来自南方各口岸中立国视察小组的指责，在各该地点联合国军方面不但在中立国监察委员会及中立国视察小组进行工作时不积极与之合作，甚至反而对驻在那里的中立国视察小组的活动加以限制、阻挠和侵犯。”报告指出：由于美方对中立国视察小组的活动加以限制、阻挠和侵犯，“中立国监察委员会过去八个多月的经验表明，在目前的情况下小组是无法在联合国军地区执行有效的观察与视察的。”
    报告的第二部分列举了许多事实揭露美方对在南朝鲜各中立国视察小组的活动进行限制、阻挠和侵犯。报告指出：“为了使驻在各口岸的中立国视察小组能对替换进行有效的监督与视察，停战协定第四十三款规定给予此等中立国视察小组以在其各自口岸地区内充分移动的便利。”报告并指出：“中立国监察委员会认为中立国视察小组上船的权利对于进行有效的监督和视察是非常重要和必要的，委员会并已如此地指示了各中立国视察小组。但是，联合国军方面在十月六日的信中禁止了在所有南方各口岸的中立国视察小组上船”，“甚至在没有别的办法和可能来进行对受停战协定限制的入境与出境物资的监督与视察时也不允许小组上船。”报告指出：“由于联合国军方面的上述干涉，在各口岸的船只已被置于监督与视察之外。”而在停战协定所开列的五个南朝鲜口岸中，有仁川、釜山、江陵和群山等四个口岸是位于沿海的口岸。
    报告指出：中立国监察委员会能举出许多美方对作战飞机移动的不准确的、过迟的报告和甚至于不报告的例子。例如，大邱中立国视察小组在一月份没有能够视察到的作战飞机就有一百十八架，而在三月份没有能够视察到的作战飞机竟有二百零五架。其他口岸的情形更是令人吃惊，在一九五四年三月份，在经由仁川口岸替换的一百三十三架作战飞机中就有一百二十五架没有及时地向仁川中立国视察小组提出报告。
    报告说：“在釜山和仁川有许多例子说明联合国军方面拒不允许中立国视察小组开箱视察。例如，在仁川口岸当局的代表不允许中立国视察小组视察在港口发现的箱子的内容，这样将箱子置于视察之外是联合国军方面干涉中立国视察小组工作的另一行动。”报告指出：“中立国视察小组对各口岸既不能进行充分监察，从而也就不能保证停战协定所限制的增援性作战物资没有被运入朝鲜。”报告指出，美方甚至公然违反停战协定，禁止仁川中立国视察小组在一月二十日和二十一日进入港口执行其职责。报告指出：“联合国军方面的这种干涉是对停战协定的一项严重违反。”
    报告揭露美方采取欺骗隐瞒的办法阻挠中立国视察小组的工作，从而运进大批增援性的作战物资。报告指出：“根据九月二十八日双方所缔结的协议，关于各方为替换目的而输入或撤出朝鲜的每批作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的报告，应不迟于其输入或撤出朝鲜后十天以内每日提交给中立国监察委员会。联合国军方面向中立国监察委员会提交的全部报告中几乎有三分之一是事后甚至在晚达一百六十七天后加以更正的，有时一份报告就更正了和补充了三次、四次以至六次。”“必须注意到一九五四年二月份和三月份上半月的各更正报告中所改动的材料和数字是牵涉到几十架作战飞机和装甲车辆，几百挺机关枪和冲锋枪，几十具火箭投射器，成千枝步枪和成千万发弹药的。必须注意到联合国军方面只是在获得了中立国视察小组所报告的上述各项物资的详情之后才将更正报告送给中立国监察委员会的。”
    报告揭露美方以不报告具有不同性能的作战物资的副型的办法来增加它在朝鲜的军事力量。报告指出：联合国军方面拒绝报告作战物资的副型。“早在一九五三年十一月十日中立国监察委员会即向军事停战委员会交涉要联合国军方面报告停战最初三个月期间作为替换用的所有作战飞机的副型。但迄今为止，中立国监察委员会并未接到联合国军方面关于这件事情的任何进一步材料。在这种情况下，中立国视察小组在进行有效监督中就遭遇了很多困难，特别是由于联合国军方面是在将性能较高副型的作战飞机运入朝鲜来替换性能较低副型的作战飞机。”
    报告指出：美方甚至对中立国视察小组的人员进行侵犯和侮辱，例如在大邱凶殴小组瑞典秘书拉尔逊，在江陵公开绑架小组波兰人员哈都克耶维赤，在仁川又企图对小组波兰人员雅盖尔尼茨基施行类似的勾当。报告指出：“这种一再发生的行为不仅是对中立国视察小组在执行其职司上的蓄意阻挠，而且也是对中立国监察委员会的严重侮辱。”
    报告的第三部分指出：“中立国视察小组的视察和观察活动受到了联合国军方面的限制、阻挠和侵犯，这种情况正日趋严重，因为与此同时在南方各口岸的中立国视察小组送来了大批报告说，联合国军方面将增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药运入朝鲜，而一再地违反了停战协定第十三款卯项的规定。”报告最后说：“中立国监察委员会波兰委员与捷克斯洛伐克委员充分认识到这种情况，因此认为向军事停战委员会报告各项事实是它的责任。中立国监察委员会波兰委员与捷克斯洛伐克委员考虑到目前情况的不断恶化对可能产生的朝鲜停战的稳定的严重后果，因此认为有必要要求军事停战委员会联合国军方面立即采取措施来停止限制与阻挠，使中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组在南方各口岸能进行停战协定所要求的有效的监察和视察。”
