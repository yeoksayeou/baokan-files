Telegram of Tribute to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

While we were suffering from a severe snow disaster, with transportation cut off, people and livestock starving, and livestock constantly dying, you sent planes to airdrop large quantities of grain to us, saving our livestock and protecting our lives and property. We are overjoyed and endlessly grateful!

Recalling the past, before liberation, the reactionary ruling classes of all dynasties only knew how to impose levies and demand livestock from the pastoral people, beating, scolding, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, never caring about the deaths of people and livestock. At that time, the pastoral areas had also suffered countless snow disasters, but who ever remembered us at the critical moment of human and animal deaths? The reactionary rulers never gave us a single grain or a blade of grass. People died, tens of thousands of livestock died, and they never asked once. But today, you—dear Chairman Mao—sent grain to us from faraway Beijing, how can we not be moved to tears!

Dear Chairman Mao! Our Mongolian people, under your wise leadership, and together with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, were liberated from the oppression of internal and external enemies. Our Mongolian people have become members of the loving and united family of all ethnic groups. In the past few years, under your leadership, our diseases have been cured, our livestock has developed, and our lives have greatly improved. We have forever escaped the bitter sea of poverty, ignorance, disease, and death. Your boundless concern, your benevolent radiance, will forever shine upon us. The deep kindness is forever unforgettable by all of our herdsmen. We can only follow you forever, and walk on the bright and splendid road you have pointed out.

Dear Chairman Mao! This snow disaster proves that our animal husbandry production is still extremely scattered and backward, and cannot withstand the attacks of natural disasters. We must strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups under the guidance of the general line and general task of the country's transition period, gradually carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the pastoral areas, actively replenish disaster resistance equipment, and strive to minimize the death of livestock and increase the production of more livestock and fur to support our motherland. Regarding the current snow disaster, we, on behalf of all the herdsmen of the Eastern United Banner, confidently assure you: We are determined to do our best to carry out disaster relief work, and guarantee that every grain of the grain you sent will be effective. We deeply know that preserving one more livestock is adding one more strength to the construction of the motherland.

We wish the great leader of our people of all ethnic groups a long life!

The Entire Delegation of the First People's Congress of the Eastern United Banner, Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

### 向毛主席的致敬电

    向毛主席的致敬电亲爱的毛主席：
    当我们正遭到严重雪灾，交通断绝、人饥畜饿、牲畜不断死亡的时候，您派来飞机给我们空投了大批粮食，救活了我们的牲畜，保全了我们的生命财产，我们欢欣鼓舞，感激无尽！
    回想解放以前，历代的反动统治阶级只知道向牧区人民摊差要畜，打骂烧杀，奸淫掠夺，人畜死亡从不曾放在他们的心上。那时候，牧区也曾遭受过无数次的雪灾，在人亡畜死的关头，有谁曾经记起过我们呢？反动统治者从来也没有给过我们一粒粮、一根草。人死了，成千上万的牲畜死了，从没有过问一次，但是，今天，您——亲爱的毛主席却从遥远的北京给我们送来了粮食，怎能不令我们感激落泪啊！
    亲爱的毛主席！我们蒙古民族是在您英明的领导下，和全国各兄弟民族一道从内外敌人的压迫下得到解放的，我们蒙古民族已成了各民族友爱团结大家庭中的一员。几年来，在您的领导下，我们的疾病得到医治，我们的牲畜有了发展，生活大大改善，我们已经永远摆脱了贫困愚昧和疾病死亡的苦海。您的无限关怀，您的仁慈的光辉永远照耀着我们，深厚的恩情是我们全体牧民永世不忘的，我们只有永远跟着您，按照您指引的光明灿烂的大路走。
    亲爱的毛主席！这次雪灾证明了我们的畜牧业生产还极其分散落后，经不起自然灾害的袭击。我们一定要在国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的照耀下，加强各民族团结，逐步开展牧区的互助合作运动，积极充实抗灾设备，争取在最大限度上减少牲畜的死亡，增产更多的牲畜和皮毛来支援我们的祖国。对于当前的雪灾，我们代表东联旗全体牧民满怀信心地向您提出保证：我们决心全力作好抗灾工作，您送来的粮食保证作到粒粒有效，我们深深知道多保全一头牲畜就是给建设祖国增加一分力量。
    祝我们各民族人民的伟大领袖万寿无疆！
                      内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟东部联合旗首届人民代表大会全体代表
            一九五四年四月四日
