Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in North China
Actively Supply Farmers with Seeds

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of North China are actively adjusting and supplying farmers with various seeds in coordination with spring plowing production. In January and February, the Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized and adjusted more than 2.47 million jin of wheat seeds, and also supplied some other seeds. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative prepared more than 57 million jin of tested high-quality cotton seeds for cotton farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives in five special districts and two cities in the province prepared more than 31 million jin of spring wheat, peanut, and potato seeds. The Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Baodi, and Ji County supply and marketing cooperatives also supplied 7.73 million jin of early-maturing crop seeds to farmers in disaster areas.

    Many supply and marketing cooperatives paid attention to investigating the need for seeds and publicizing pesticide seed dressing techniques in the process of adjusting and supplying seeds. The Tong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei conducted a survey of cotton farmers' self-retained seeds and supplied them according to their needs to ensure the realization of the expanded cotton field plan. The Jinghai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in conjunction with the agricultural technology extension station, organized cadres to learn pesticide seed dressing techniques. In order to solve the difficulty of farmers not knowing how to use pesticides for seed dressing, the Wuqing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative first mixed the pesticides and then supplied them to the farmers.

    华北各地供销合作社
    积极供应农民籽种
    华北区各地供销合作社配合春耕生产积极调剂与供应农民各种籽种。山西省供销合作社一、二月份里组织调剂了二百四十七万多斤麦种，并供应了一部分其他种籽。河北省供销合作社准备了五千七百余万斤鉴定好的优良棉种，供应棉农。该省五个专区和两个市的供销合作社，准备好了三千一百多万斤春麦、花生和土豆等籽种；保定、张家口、宝坻、冀县供销合作社并供应灾区农民早熟作物籽种七百七十三万斤。
    不少供销合作社在调剂与供应籽种中，注意了调查需要籽种情况和宣传农药拌种技术。河北通县供销合作社进行了棉农自留种的调查，按照需要供应，以保证实现扩大棉田计划；静海县供销合作社结合农业技术推广站，组织干部学习农药拌种技术；武清县供销社为了解决农民不会用农药拌种的困难，先将农药拌好了，然后供应农民。
