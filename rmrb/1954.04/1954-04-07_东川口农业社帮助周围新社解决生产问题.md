    Dongchuankou Agricultural Cooperative Helps Surrounding New Cooperatives Solve Production Problems
    Eleven new and old agricultural production cooperatives in the Dongchuankou area of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, have organized an experience exchange network to regularly exchange experiences and solve production problems. With the exception of the Dongchuankou Cooperative, which was established earlier, the other ten cooperatives were established not long ago and lack experience in business management and labor organization. Wang Zhiqi, the director of the old Dongchuankou Cooperative, used the experience and methods of his own cooperative to help other cooperatives solve problems. For example, the labor quota of the Xichuankou Agricultural Production Cooperative was unreasonable, and many people had opinions and disputes over work points. After Wang Zhiqi helped to revise the quota, everyone had no objections. The profit distribution system of the Xiyue Agricultural Production Cooperative originally stipulated that households with labor should distribute profits according to five parts labor and five parts land, while households with orphans and difficulties should distribute profits according to six parts labor and four parts land. As a result, many households in difficulty wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. Wang Zhiqi helped them correct this deviation, and the members felt at ease. The production plans of cooperatives such as Mazhai and Xichuankou were initially too general, only specifying how many mu of cotton should be planted and how many jin should be produced per mu. There was no specific research on which land should be planted with cotton and how much it should produce. Some cooperative members sent fertilizer suitable for cotton fields to grain fields. Wang Zhiqi also helped them to formulate specific plans. At the same time, he also helped these cooperatives study the soil quality and expanded some cotton fields according to national needs.
    These cooperatives not only exchange experiences and solve difficulties at experience exchange meetings, but also frequently visit each other, participate in meetings, and jointly study and solve production problems. (Yanqing, Ling Song)

    东川口农业社帮助周围新社解决生产问题
    河北省邢台县东川口一带十一个新、老农业生产合作社组织了一个经验交流网，定期交流经验，解决生产中的问题。这十一个社除东川口社成立较早外，其余都是不久前才建立的，在经营管理、劳力组织上都缺乏经验。东川口老社社长王志琪便用自己社里的经验和办法，帮助其他社解决问题。例如西川口农业生产合作社劳动定额不合理，很多人互相有意见、争工分。经王志琪帮助把定额修改后，大家没意见了。西岳农业生产合作社的分红制度，原定有劳力户按劳五地五分红，孤寡困难户则按劳六地四分红，这样很多困难户便要退社，王志琪帮助他们纠正了这一偏向后，社员也就都安心了。马寨、西川口等社生产计划起初都订得笼统，只有种棉花多少亩，每亩要求产多少斤，至于哪块地种棉花，产多少，就没有具体研究，有的社员把适合棉地用的肥料送到谷地去了。王志琪也帮助他们订出了具体计划。同时又帮助这几个社研究了土质，按国家需要扩大了一部分棉田。
    这些社不仅在经验交流会上互相交流经验、解决困难，还经常互相访问、参加会议，共同研究和解决生产中的问题。　（延庆  凌松）
