Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: To supply the needs of national economic construction, this year, China's state-owned iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical, and building materials industrial systems will produce more products than last year. According to the plan stipulated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, the total output value of these four industrial systems this year will increase by more than 15% compared to last year. The production plan for various major products will reach or exceed the state's control figures, with pig iron production increasing by more than 30% compared to last year, steel production increasing by about 15%, and steel material production increasing by more than 8%. Among various steel materials, the production of large-scale construction steel will increase by more than seven times compared to last year, and the production of heavy rails will more than double. The production of various non-ferrous metal products will also increase significantly this year, with copper, lead, zinc, and tin production increasing by 10% to 27% compared to last year. In the chemical industry, the production of major products such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, and liquid ammonia will increase by 15% to 74% compared to last year. Among various building materials, cement production this year will increase by more than 14% compared to last year, and the production of various types of glass will increase by more than 18% compared to last year.
    The production plants and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry also plan to trial-produce and produce a large number of new specifications of products this year to meet the growing needs of economic construction. A total of 175 new specifications of steel products are planned for trial production this year, including large-sized steel, flat steel, angle steel, channel steel, seamless steel pipes, steel rails, fishplates, tie plates, and steel windows; more than ten different specifications of open-hearth high-quality steel, and more than thirty different specifications of electric furnace alloy steel, including more than ten different specifications of heat-resistant stainless steel. In addition, coke oven bricks and high-alumina bricks are also planned for trial production. In the non-ferrous metals industrial system, new specifications of products conforming to Soviet standards, such as rolled, processed products, metals, and special alloy materials, will be trial-produced this year. The chemical industry system plans to trial-produce more than one hundred new specifications of paint this year. In the building materials industry, plugging cement and clinker-free cement will be trial-produced this year. The trial production and large-scale supply of these new specifications of products will play a significant role in industrial construction in various regions. For example, the large steel plates and structural steel urgently needed for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction project will be trial-produced and supplied in large quantities by the Anshan Large-Scale Rolling Mill; many new specifications of seamless steel pipes planned to be trial-produced by the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory this year will mainly supply the needs of geological exploration and boiler, pump, and compressor manufacturing industries; the coke oven bricks planned to be trial-produced and produced in large quantities this year will basically meet the requirements of newly built coking furnaces and major repairs of old coking furnaces; the flat steel, channel steel, and angle steel planned to be trial-produced this year will also supply the construction needs of various regions.
    The rapid growth of various major products of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system is of great significance for accelerating the pace of economic construction in various regions. This year, the amount of heavy and light rails supplied by the Ministry of Heavy Industry to economic construction departments in various regions will increase by more than 50% compared to last year; large-scale steel and seamless steel pipes, which could not be produced domestically in the past, will begin to supply the needs of various departments from this year onward; the supply of nitric acid will increase by more than 85% compared to last year; caustic soda will increase by more than 25%; sodium sulfide will increase by 28%; liquid chlorine will increase by 1.8 times; cement will increase by 12%; and asbestos tiles will increase by more than 60%.
    Of the total output value increase of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system this year, about half is due to the fact that some newly built enterprises will be put into production within the year, and the remaining half will rely on tapping the potential of existing enterprises. Therefore, in addition to planning to take various effective measures to ensure that the enterprises completed within the year are put into production on time, the Ministry of Heavy Industry also plans to continue to implement the production area management system in production plants and mining enterprises, establish and thoroughly implement the factory director responsibility system, improve technical management, establish and improve necessary technical standards, technical operating procedures, and technical supervision management systems, and vigorously promote various advanced experiences to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual production plan.

    供应国家经济建设的需要
    重工业部各厂矿今年计划生产更多产品
    【新华社十五日讯】我国国营钢铁、有色金属、化学和建筑材料等工业系统，今年将生产比去年更多的产品，供应国家经济建设的需要。按照中央人民政府重工业部的计划规定，今年这四个工业系统的生产总值，将比去年增长百分之十五以上。各种主要产品的产量计划，都达到或超过国家的控制数字，其中生铁的产量将比去年增加百分之三十以上，钢的产量增长百分之十五左右，钢材的产量增长百分之八以上。在各种钢材中，大型建筑钢材的产量，将比去年增加七倍多；重轨产量增加一倍多。各种有色金属产品的产量，今年也有大量增加，其中铜、铅、锌和锡的产量，将比去年增长百分之十到二十七。化学工业中的主要产品，如硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、烧碱和液体氨的产量，将比去年增长百分之十五到七十四。各种建筑材料中，今年水泥的产量比去年增长百分之十四以上，各种玻璃的产量比去年增长百分之十八以上。
    重工业部所属各生产厂矿，今年还计划试制并生产大量新规格的产品，以满足经济建设中日益增长的需要。今年计划试制新规格的钢铁产品共一百七十五种，其中有大型钢材、扁钢、角钢、槽钢、无缝钢管、钢轨、鱼尾板、垫板和钢窗等；有十多种不同规格的平炉优质钢、三十多种不同规格的电炉合金钢，其中包括十多种不同规格的耐热不锈钢。此外，计划试制的还有焦炉砖和高铝砖等。有色金属工业系统中，今年将试制压延、加工品、金属和特殊合金材料等合乎苏联标准的新规格产品。化学工业系统今年计划试制一百多种新规格的油漆。建筑材料工业中，今年将试制堵塞水泥、无熟料水泥。这些新规格产品的试制和大量供应，将在各地工业建设中发挥巨大作用。例如武汉长江大桥修筑工程中急需的大型钢板和型钢，将由鞍山大型轧钢厂试制后大量供应；鞍山无缝钢管厂今年计划试制的许多种新规格的无缝钢管，将主要供应地质钻探和锅炉、水泵、压缩机等制造工业的需要；今年计划试制并大量生产的焦炉砖，将基本满足新建炼焦炉和大修旧焦炉的要求；今年计划试制的扁钢、槽钢和角钢等，也将供应各地建筑的需要。
    重工业部系统各种主要产品的迅速增长，对于加快各地经济建设的速度有着十分重要的意义。今年，各地经济建设部门得到重工业部供应的重轨和轻轨，将比去年增加百分之五十以上；过去国内不能生产的大型钢材及无缝钢管，从今年起将开始供应各部门的需要；硝酸供应量比去年增加百分之八十五以上；烧碱增加百分之二十五以上；硫化碱增加百分之二十八；液氯增加一点八倍；水泥增加百分之十二；石棉瓦增加百分之六十以上。
    重工业部系统今年增长的生产总值中，约有半数是由于有些新建企业在年内投入生产，其余约半数要靠发挥原有企业的潜在力量。因此，重工业部除计划采取各种有效措施，保证年内建成的企业按时投入生产，并计划在生产厂矿企业中继续推行生产区域管理制，建立和深入贯彻厂长负责制，改进技术管理，建立和健全必要的技术标准、技术操作规程和技术监督等管理制度，大力推广各种先进经验，以保证完成和超额完成全年的生产计划。
