Sun Can of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, Zhejiang Provincial Company, Successfully Creates "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm"

Sun Can of the Raw Cotton Section of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, Zhejiang Provincial Company, has successfully created a "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm." The first "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" has been tested and found to be effective. This is an important contribution to ensuring the safety of stored materials.

The "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" is made based on physical principles, using mercury, platinum wire, etc. It can perform automatic alarm, automatic temperature regulation, and automatic fire extinguishing tasks. The main component of the "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" is a specially made thermometer. This thermometer is marked with various temperature values ​​required for different materials, divided into "danger temperature," "flammable temperature," and "ignition temperature" levels. A platinum wire is inserted into the mercury bulb at the bottom of the thermometer; another platinum wire is inserted at each temperature level, and one end of these platinum wires is connected to an alarm bell, a blower, and fire-fighting equipment, respectively. When this thermometer is placed in the stored materials, if the temperature rises, the mercury rises accordingly. When it reaches the "danger temperature" level, it connects with the platinum wire, completing the circuit, and the alarm bell sounds. When the mercury rises to the "flammable temperature" level, it automatically starts the blower to regulate the temperature. If the temperature reaches the point of ignition, the mercury rises and connects to the platinum wire connected to the fire-fighting equipment, completing the circuit and causing the fire-fighting equipment to automatically extinguish the fire.

Warehouse management personnel can proactively control the temperature of stored materials and use the "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" to prevent mildew, fire, and other issues.

The "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" has a wide range of applications and is suitable for warehouses storing grain, oil, chemical raw materials, coal, and other flammable items. Each unit only costs 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, Zhejiang Provincial Company, is currently preparing to further improve the "Fixed Temperature Automatic Alarm" and promote its adoption in all warehouses.

    中国花纱布公司浙江省公司
    孙灿创造“定温自动报警器”成功
    中国花纱布公司浙江省公司原棉科孙灿创造“定温自动报警器”成功，第一具“定温自动报警器”经试验后效果良好。这对保障仓储物资的安全是一个重要的贡献。
    “定温自动报警器”是根据物理原理，利用汞、铂金丝等制成的。它能担任自动报警、自动调温和自动灭火的工作。“定温自动报警器”的主要构成部分是一支特制的温度计。这种温度计上标明了根据各种不同物资所要求的各种温度数，分成“危险温度”、“易燃温度”、“致燃温度”数级。温度计下端的水银球中插有一根铂金丝；在各级温度数上又各插有一根铂金丝，这些铂金丝的一端分别联结着警铃、鼓风器以及消防设备。将这个温度计放在所保管的物资中，遇到温度上升时，水银即随而上升，达到“危险温度”级时就和铂金丝相接通电，警铃就发出警报；水银上升到“易燃温度”级时，就自动开动鼓风器调温；假如温度达到致燃的程度，水银就上升和联结着消防设备的铂金丝通电，使消防设备自动灭火。
    仓储保管人员可以主动掌握保管物资的温度，利用“定温自动报警器”做好防霉、防火等工作。
  “定温自动报警器”适用范围很广，粮食、油类、化工原料、煤和其它易燃物品的仓库都适用，每具成本也只需四、五万元。中国花纱布公司浙江省公司现正准备将“定温自动报警器”进一步加以改进后，推广到各仓库采用。（孙禅　沈维诚）
