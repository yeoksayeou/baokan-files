Xinhua News Agency:

    Since the Secretariat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was established on the 8th, it is now actively preparing to begin work. According to the academy's regulations, the Secretariat is the assistant to the council in academic leadership. The Secretariat has several secretaries who, in addition to conducting their own scientific research, are primarily responsible for contacting domestic scientific authorities and organizing relevant scientific research. At the same time, the academy is actively preparing to establish the faculty committees and the compilation and publishing committee. The faculty committees are the academy's organizations for dividing labor and providing academic leadership to the affiliated research institutes, and will be composed of accomplished scientists from both inside and outside the academy. The task of the compilation and publishing committee is to uniformly plan the academy's compilation and publishing matters and to conduct academic review of the academy's scientific publications, and accomplished scientists from various disciplines both inside and outside the academy will also be invited to participate in the work. These series of measures by the Chinese Academy of Sciences will effectively and gradually strengthen the academy's academic leadership over scientific research work, and will also effectively unite scientists across the country to better exert their strength for our country's socialist construction.

    中国科学院采取措施加强对科学工作的领导
    中国科学院秘书处于八日成立后，现已积极准备开始工作。按照该院规定，秘书处是院务会议在学术领导方面的助手。秘书处设秘书若干人，他们除进行本身的科学研究工作外，主要任务是负责联络国内科学权威人士并进行有关科学研究的组织工作。同时，该院正积极筹建各学部委员会和编译出版委员会。各学部委员会是该院分工对所属各研究所进行学术领导的机构，将由院内外有成就的科学家组成。编译出版委员会的任务是统一规划该院编译出版事宜和对该院科学出版物进行学术审查，亦将聘请院内外各科有成就的科学家参加工作。以上各委员会的组成，正由该院秘书处协助院务会议及各委员会正副主任积极筹备并即将向各有关方面征求意见。中国科学院这一系列的措施，将有效地逐步加强该院对科学研究工作的学术领导，也将有效地团结全国科学家，更好地为我国社会主义建设事业发挥力量。　（新华社）
