State-Owned Farms in Heilongjiang and Liaoxi Provinces Begin Sowing Spring Wheat

    Some state-owned farms in Heilongjiang and Liaoxi Provinces have begun sowing wheat.

    Generally, the spring plowing preparations of the fourteen state-owned mechanized farms in Heilongjiang Province this year started half a month to a month earlier than in previous years. The actions were swift and the quality was also good. According to incomplete statistics from six farms including Hongxing and Erlongshan, a total of 5,100 tons of seeds were selected (needing just over 4,900 tons of seeds), and generally, they were selected two or three times. 530 tons of granular fertilizer were manufactured, and more than 5,200 tons of miscellaneous ash and manure fertilizer were accumulated. Generally, the seeds have undergone sun-drying preheating, disinfection and soaking, etc. These production-increasing measures did not exist in previous years. The Fuxin Paozi Farm in Liaoxi Province selected and bartered more than 9,500 jin of "Crooked Neck Zhang" sorghum seeds suitable for local planting, purchased more than 5,000 jin of "Little Fire Wheat" seeds, and ordered 35 jin of Ceresan for seed disinfection. At the same time, all mechanized farms promptly carried out mechanical maintenance work. In late March, the State-owned Mechanical Farm in the Horqin Right Wing Rear Banner of Heilongjiang Province, the Tiebei Farm in Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, and others have begun sowing spring wheat.

    黑龙江辽西两省国营农场开始播种春麦
    黑龙江省和辽西省部分国营农场已经开始播种小麦。
    黑龙江省十四处国营机械农场今年的春耕准备工作一般比往年提早半个月到一个月，行动快，质量也好。据红星、二龙山等六个农场的不完全统计，共选种五千一百吨（需要种籽四千九百多吨），一般都选两、三遍；制造颗粒肥料五百三十吨，积小灰、厩肥等五千二百多吨；种籽一般都经过晒种预温、消毒和浸种等；这些增产措施是往年所没有过的。辽西省阜新泡子农场自选和串换了九千五百多斤适合于当地种植的“歪脖张”高粱种籽，购买了五千多斤“小火麦”种籽，并订购了三十五斤赛力散，用来进行种籽消毒。同时，各机械农场都及时进行了机械检修工作。三月下旬，黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗国营机械农场、辽西省新民县铁北农场等已开始播种春小麦。
