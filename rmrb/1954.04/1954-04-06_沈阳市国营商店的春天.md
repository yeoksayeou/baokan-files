    The Springtime of State-Run Stores in Shenyang
    Cheng Yan
    The footsteps of spring have already crossed into Shenyang, outside the [Shanhaiguan] Pass.

    In the state-run department stores, on counters that just days ago displayed leather coats and cotton-padded jackets, now appear all kinds of unlined and single-layer garments. Where heavy cotton and leather coats once hung, newly made, beautiful silk transparent raincoats shimmer. In the shoe section, the bulky cotton galoshes and cotton-padded leather shoes are no longer to be seen; instead, new-style leather shoes and soft cloth shoes, sponge-soled sneakers, and those shiny black rubber boots are displayed before customers. Those large raccoon fur hats and black lambskin hats have also been replaced by various single-layer hats and colorful gauze scarves.

    In front of the counter of the cotton, yarn, and cloth group of the state-run trade enterprise joint company, many young women are drawn in by the dozens of new patterns of fine cloth, reluctant to leave. Those terry cloths most suitable for making shirts now – last year many people wanted to buy them but couldn't find them for sale – are now available on the counters in a full range of colors, for people to make into terry cloth blankets, pajamas, and shirts. The “Four Gentlemen” linen and seersucker, bubble crepe produced by state-run factories are the new goods most loved by women; as soon as a bolt of cloth is opened, it sells out in less than half an hour. The yardstick in the salesclerk’s hand moves back and forth like a shuttle on a loom, never stopping. They sell an average of 15,000 feet of printed cloth every day.

    Woolen goods, three or four years ago, were expensive clothing that ordinary workers could not afford. They would walk past the woolen fabric group's counter, not even glancing at those woolens. In the past two years, ordinary mid-level technical workers generally have one or two sets of new cotton clothes, and also want to add a pair of woolen trousers. Now, the Joint Company and Department Store Number One sell an average of about one hundred meters of woolen fabric every day. In the past month alone, nearly three thousand meters of woolen fabric have been bought by people to make spring clothes.

    The various groups of the Joint Company’s clothing department are also packed with people. This year, Clothing Group One has prepared nearly four hundred kinds of spring clothing, more than three times the amount of last spring. Workers are happily selecting well-fitting youth outfits and work clothes here. One young worker said to a salesclerk: "Last year I came several times and couldn't buy such canvas work clothes. Your work has really improved this year!"

    Spring comes to the world once a year. But before liberation and after liberation, people's views on spring are very different. An old railway worker, on his day off on Monday, came to the Joint Company with his wife to buy spring clothes. The old woman chose a brightly colored fine cloth for her daughter-in-law, preparing to make a set of unlined trousers and a jacket for her. When she learned that her daughter-in-law also liked another kind of printed cloth, the old woman did not give up the first one to buy the second one, but said: "We have money, if you like this one, then let's buy another piece." He happily said to me: "These years are not like before. In the past, for working-class families like us, we were afraid of the changing of seasons. In the spring, we had to take the cotton out of the cotton clothes, wash and mend them to get through spring and summer, and in the autumn we had to add another layer of patches and put in the old cotton to get through the winter. At that time, not to mention changing into new ones, we couldn't even wear a whole piece of clothing! Now, in the spring, our whole family, old and young, can change into a new set of clothes!"

    In New China, people's lives will gradually improve, and their needs will gradually increase. In order to meet the needs of the people, when spring clothes have just been put on the shelves, Shenyang's state-run stores are already rushing to purchase various undershirts, sandals, and other summer goods.

    沈阳市国营商店的春天
    程雁
    春天的脚步已经跨进关外的沈阳市。
    在国营百货商店里，几天前还摆着皮衣、棉袄的柜台上，如今已出现了各式各样的夹衣和单衣；原来高悬着棉、皮大衣的地方，新制的漂亮的丝绸透明雨衣已在那里闪闪发光；在卖鞋的地方，再看不见肥大的棉胶鞋和棉皮鞋了，摆在顾客眼前的是新式单皮鞋和轻软的布鞋、海绵底的球鞋和那些黑亮的水鞋。那些大耳朵貉绒皮帽和黑羊羔皮帽，也已经被各式单帽和五光十色的纱头巾所代替。
    在国营贸易企业联营公司花纱布小组的柜台前，许多青年妇女被几十种新花样的细布吸引着不肯走开。那些最适于现在做衬衣的毛巾布，去年有很多人想买找不到卖处，如今已有颜色齐全的毛巾布出现在柜台上，供人们做毛巾被、睡衣和衬衣。国营工厂出产的“四君子”麻纱和泡泡纱、泡泡布，是妇女们最喜欢的新货；一疋布打开，用不到半个钟头就卖光了。营业员手里的尺，像织布机上的梭子，来回不停，他们平均每天要卖出一万五千尺花布。
    毛织品，在三、四年前，对于一般工人来说，还是无力购买的贵重衣料；他们从呢绒小组的柜台前走过，对那些毛料子，连看也不想看一眼。在近二年，普通中等技术工人，一般都有一、两套新棉布衣服，另外还要添一件毛料裤子。现在，联营公司和百货第一商店每天售出的呢绒料子，平均总在一百公尺左右。近一个月来，已有近三千公尺的呢绒料子被人们买去缝制春装。
    联营公司服装部各组，也挤满了人。服装第一组今年准备了近四百种春季服装，这个数量比去年春季多三倍以上。工人们在这里高兴地挑选着合体的青年服、工作服。一位青年工人向营业员说：“去年我来了几趟也没有买着这样的帆布工作服，今年你们的工作真是改进了！”
    春天一年一度地来到人间。但是在解放以前和解放以后，人们对春天的看法是大不相同的。一位老铁路工人，在星期一休假的日子，同他的老伴等到联营公司来采办春装。老太太给儿媳妇挑选了一块花色鲜丽的细布，准备给媳妇做一套夹裤、夹袄。当她知道媳妇也喜欢另一种花布的时候，这位老太太没有放弃前一种去买这一种，而是说：“手里有钱，喜欢这样的，就再扯一块吧。”他老人家高兴地对我说：“这几年可不像早先了，以前像咱们做工的人家，就怕换季。春天只好把棉衣的棉花掏出去，洗洗补补过春过夏，秋后还得再添一层补绽装上旧棉花过冬。那时候不用说换新的，连身囫囵衣裳也穿不上啊！现在到春天，咱们全家老小都换上一身新衣裳啦！”
    在新中国，人民的生活将会逐步改善，需要将会逐步提高。为了满足人民的需要，当春装刚摆上柜台的时候，沈阳市国营商店已在赶紧采购各种汗衫、凉鞋等夏季商品了。
