To support farmers in spring ploughing and strengthen the planned nature of agricultural production, pre-purchase of agricultural products has been launched nationwide.

[Our Newspaper] According to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on the pre-purchase of agricultural products in 1954, pre-purchase work has been launched successively across the country.

In the Northeast region, the amount of autumn grain to be pre-purchased this year will account for about 10% of the total planned grain purchase for the year. The first phase of pre-purchase of coarse grains, soybeans, etc., has generally begun. Supply and marketing cooperatives in provinces such as Songjiang, Liaoxi, and Liaodong have begun signing pre-purchase contracts with farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in provinces such as Jilin and Rehe have distributed pre-purchase funds to districts and villages. It is estimated that after pre-selling a portion of their grain, farmers in the Northeast region will receive over 200 billion yuan in cash to invest in spring ploughing production. The North China region will pre-purchase 3.5 trillion yuan worth of major agricultural and sideline products, and farmers in the region will receive 500 billion yuan in deposits. The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducted key experiments starting in late March and has now universally launched pre-purchase work. The pre-purchase work in Shanxi Province and the suburbs of Beijing will be fully launched around April 20. In the Central South region, supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province began pre-purchasing grain in key areas in early April. Guangdong Province has launched pre-purchase work for silkworm cocoons, peanuts, etc. According to the regional plan for pre-purchasing grain, the state will pay farmers 500 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits. In the East China region, supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces are pre-purchasing tea in key tea-producing areas. Zhejiang Province is pre-purchasing raw silk in key cocoon-producing areas. Cotton pre-purchase work in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be launched successively. Shandong Province, a key peanut-producing area, and Zhejiang Province, a key jute-producing area, are preparing to pre-purchase peanuts and jute, respectively. Sichuan Province in the Southwest region and Shaanxi Province in the Northwest region have also begun or are actively preparing to carry out pre-purchase work for grain, cotton, tea, etc.

Since the launch of the pre-purchase of agricultural products, various regions have helped farmers overcome some difficulties in production and life, and have powerfully supported spring ploughing production, thus receiving warm welcome from the broad masses of farmers. In Gaoqiao District, Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, usury activities in rural areas were on the rise when the state did not pre-purchase wheat. Farmers compared borrowing high-interest loans to "drinking brine when thirsty." Now that the state is pre-purchasing wheat and issuing interest-free deposits, farmers say that the people's government has helped them break the "brine jar." When the state was about to carry out pre-purchase work, the Gao Baosheng mutual aid group in Liushudi Village, Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, urgently needed funds to purchase fertilizer and farm tools. After receiving the deposit, they bought twelve small farm tools and one hundred jin of ferrous sulfate. The Huang Zhujia Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengmen District, Minhou County, Fujian Province, used the pre-purchase funds to buy back 800 dan of manure from Fuzhou City and put it into spring ploughing production. According to statistics from five key pre-purchase experimental townships in Tongling, Quanjiao, Chuxian, Huaining and other counties in Anhui Province, farmers pre-sold 67% of the expected total output of wheat and 70% of rapeseed to the state. 99.4% of the farmers in Sihu Township, Dangtu County, actively signed contracts with the cooperative for pre-selling wheat and rapeseed.

Through the pre-purchase of agricultural products, the broad masses of farmers have understood the state's needs for various agricultural products, and many farmers have rearranged their production according to the state's needs. The Wang Yinmao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, originally planned not to grow oil crops this year. After signing the contract, they revised their production plan and decided to grow 15 mu of oil crops. After signing the contract, the Wang Shilin Agricultural Production Cooperative decided to grow 6 mu more of oil crops and 4 mu more of spring wheat. Wang Shilin said: "In the past, when we formulated production plans, we always planted what we used and grew what we ate, without considering the needs of the state. After signing the pre-purchase contract this time, I realized the significance of carrying out production according to the needs of the state."

    支持农民春耕，加强农业生产的计划性
    全国各地展开农产品预购工作
    【本报讯】根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于一九五四年农产品预购工作的指示，全国各地相继展开农产品预购工作。
    东北区今年预购秋粮的数量，将占全年计划购粮总量的百分之十左右，第一期粗粮、大豆等的预购工作已普遍开始。松江、辽西、辽东等省供销合作社已开始和农民签订预购合同，吉林、热河等省供销合作社已把预购金发到区、村。预计东北全区农民预售一部分粮食后，将可得到两千余亿元现款，用来投入春耕生产。华北区将预购价值三万五千亿元的主要农业及副业产品，全区农民可得到五千亿元的定金。河北省供销合作社从三月下旬起进行了重点试验，现已普遍展开预购工作；山西省和北京市郊区的预购工作，在四月二十日左右全面展开。中南区湖北省各地供销合作社在四月初就有重点地展开预购粮食工作，广东省对蚕茧、花生等的预购工作已展开；根据全区预购粮食的计划，国家将付给农民预购定金五千亿元。华东区安徽、浙江、福建三省的供销合作社正在重点产茶区预购茶叶；浙江省正在重点产茧区预购土丝。山东、江苏、浙江、安徽的棉花预购工作将陆续开始；花生的重点产地山东省，麻的重点产地浙江省，正分别准备预购花生和络麻。西南区的四川省、西北区的陕西省等，也已开始或正积极准备进行粮食、棉花、茶叶等的预购工作。
    各地展开农产品预购工作以后，帮助农民克服了生产和生活上的一些困难，有力地支持了春耕生产，因而受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。浙江省瑞安县高桥区在国家没有预购小麦时，农村高利贷活动正在抬头。农民比喻借高利贷是“渴了喝盐卤”。现在国家预购小麦，发给无息定金，农民们都说人民政府帮助他们打破了“盐卤罐”。山西省高平县柳树底村郜保盛互助组在国家要进行预购工作时，正急需一笔款购买肥料、农具，收到定金后，他们便买了十二件小农具、一百斤黑矾。福建省闽侯县城门区黄朱嘉农业生产合作社拿到预购款就到福州市买回八百担粪肥，投入春耕生产。据安徽省铜陵、全椒、滁县、怀宁等县五个预购重点试验乡的统计，农民预售给国家的小麦占预计总产量的百分之六十七，菜籽占百分之七十。当涂县四垾乡百分之九十九点四的农户，都积极和合作社签订了预售小麦、菜籽的合同。
    通过农产品预购工作，广大农民了解了国家对各种农产品的需要情况，许多农民按照国家的需要重新安排了自己的生产。山西省平顺县王寅卯农业生产合作社今年原计划不种油料作物，签订合同后，又修订了生产计划，决定种十五亩油料作物。王士林农业生产合作社签订合同后，决定多种六亩油料作物、四亩春小麦。王士林说：“以前我们订生产计划，总是自己用啥种啥，吃啥栽啥，不考虑国家的需要；经过这次订预购合同，我才明白了按国家需要进行生产的意义。”
