Dulles's "Comprehensive Foreign Policy"
Wu Quan

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 5 on "The Relationship Between the U.S. Mutual Security Program and the U.S. Comprehensive Foreign Policy," publicly announcing that the United States would intensify its military aid to support its global aggressive military policy, also known as the "Comprehensive Foreign Policy."

In the current U.S. global aggressive military policy, intervention in the Indochina War to create international tensions is placed in the most important position.

In his speech, Dulles vigorously hyped up the so-called "enormous dangers" of the Indochina situation, and unscrupulously fabricated facts, distorted the truth, and falsely accused China of "closely interfering" in the Indochina War. However, Dulles could not conceal the purpose of his rumor-mongering, which was to create excuses for further direct intervention in the Indochina War and to intensify the atmosphere of expanding the Indochina War in order to arrange "joint action" and force France and other countries to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. Dulles openly said, "I do not deny" the "possibility" of the United States directly intervening in the Indochina War; and "the only thing I am talking about now is joint action."

In this speech, Dulles still dared not directly say what specific adventurous steps were included in the so-called "joint action," but only demanded that the "free world be united," especially to force France to "stand closely with it." However, the United States has launched a large-scale propaganda campaign, making detailed explanations of Dulles's "joint action" that are not without basis. Recent Western newspapers have widely reported that the U.S. State Department is carrying out a conspiracy to collude with some countries to issue a provocative "joint statement" on intervention in the Indochina War, which has been confirmed. The U.S. State Department spokesman publicly admitted on the 6th that Dulles had been "consulting with diplomatic representatives of countries such as Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines on the general situation in Southeast Asia."

If we look at the unease and dissatisfaction reflected in the public opinions of France, Britain, and other countries, we can more clearly understand what kind of unspeakable criminal plans Dulles's "joint action" really entails. For example, the British bourgeois newspaper "Daily Express" warned: "Are we facing a second Korea? Dulles's call for joint action in Asia is a serious adventure." The French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" even more indignantly said: "It is not American men who are dying in Indochina, but French soldiers. ... How much longer do we have to endure using the blood of our soldiers to extricate Washington from its predicament?"

Not only that. Now, Dulles has further openly stated that the United States wants its policy followers to take "joint action" "not only on the Indochina issue" but "on many issues." This means that the purpose of the U.S. ruling clique in obstructing and undermining the Geneva Conference is to drive many countries to continue to abandon their own interests and security, follow the United States to maintain the tense situation in the Far East and the world, so that the U.S. monopoly capital group can obtain billions of profits.

In his speech, Dulles emphasized the importance of "French-German unity," the rapid ratification of the "European Defense Community Treaty" by France and Italy, and the revival of German militarist forces. At the same time, Dulles indicated that the United States would unreasonably reject the Soviet Union's recent proposal to endorse the United States' participation in the "All-European Treaty guaranteeing European collective security" and to jointly study with relevant countries the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. This proposal by the Soviet Union has been met with sympathy and support from public opinion around the world, especially in European countries, which believe that the Soviet Union's proposal will help eliminate the division and confrontation of European countries and further promote the establishment of a European collective security system. However, Dulles falsely accused the Soviet Union of "attempting to undermine the unity and strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by means of infiltration." This clearly shows that the U.S. ruling clique continues to maintain the aggressive and exclusive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty in order to continue to maintain a hostile and tense atmosphere in Europe and the world.

In the current international situation, an increasingly obvious fact is that the U.S. ruling clique is sparing no effort to incite a war atmosphere in order to re-intensify international tensions. In this sinful activity, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles played a major role. Dulles, in his position as the planner and executor of U.S. foreign policy, has recently been constantly making speeches, from the U.S. "New Look" military policy to clamoring that the "free world" should take "joint action" in Southeast Asia; from baselessly asserting that the Geneva Conference might be postponed to openly ordering France to continue fighting in Vietnam. Dulles's speech on April 5 even more unreservedly revealed the U.S. military aggression policy towards the world.

What exactly does Dulles's "Comprehensive Foreign Policy" pursued by the United States include? In this policy, there is absolutely no mention of promoting normal economic and cultural relations between countries, and of course, there will be no sincerity in conducting diplomatic consultations with other countries, but it is full of so-called "preemptive" "strategies," so-called "retaliatory forces," as well as military bases, military aid, and military blocs established all over the world. It cannot be said that Dulles completely does not understand the meaning of the term "diplomacy," and his U.S. "Comprehensive Foreign Policy" is actually a complete military aggression policy, which can only show that in the minds of the U.S. ruling clique, U.S. foreign relations have no other considerations besides military aggression and financial exploitation.

Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that, for the United States, other countries in the world are either the object of U.S. military aggression or the tool of its military aggression. In his speech, Dulles clearly announced that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the targets that the U.S. "preemptive" "strategy" will "choose" to "strike," and that as long as the so-called "free countries" "establish a broad system of blocs," the United States can obtain this "choice." Therefore, in the U.S. foreign policy, the North Atlantic aggressive group is "an important component," the delayed state of the European Defense Community "cannot continue," the military agreement between Turkey and Pakistan has established a "precedent that can be emulated" for other countries, and for the "free countries" in Europe, including Fascist Franco's Spain, and the "free countries" in Asia, including South Korea and the Indochina puppet regime, the United States must provide military assistance to expand "defense forces" and continue to obtain military bases. Obviously, Dulles here not only unreservedly revealed his hostility towards China and the Soviet Union, but also once again exposed the U.S. ambition to dominate the world.

From this, people can see the extent to which the U.S. ruling clique has distorted international relations to a terrible degree, attempting to poison the international atmosphere to a serious degree.

However, the U.S. ruling clique cannot fail to see that its war policy, which is clamoring everywhere, is causing increasingly ominous reactions because it violates the fundamental interests of countries around the world. As a result, die-hard figures like Dulles are increasingly unable to restrain their anger. In this speech, Dulles once again recklessly attacked "every free country" that has expressed "impatience" or even "protest" against long-term submission to the United States, insulting these countries for seeking a way out for their own interests as "unexplainable blindness and the most ridiculous subjective ideas." Then, according to Dulles, only those countries that tamely listen to the United States and drag themselves into a dead end can win the applause of the masters in Washington.

    杜勒斯的“全面外交政策”是什么
    吴全
    美国国务卿杜勒斯四月五日在美国参议院外交委员会上就“美国共同安全计划与美国全面外交政策的关系问题”发表了演说，公开宣布美国要加紧用军事援助来支持它的全球性的侵略军事政策亦即所谓“全面外交政策”。
    在目前美国全球性的侵略军事政策中，干涉印度支那战争借以制造国际紧张局势，是被放在最主要的地位上的。
    杜勒斯在演说中就大肆渲染什么印度支那局势
  “充满着巨大危险”，并竟然不择手段地捏造事实，歪曲真相，诬蔑中国“已十分接近地干预”印度支那战争。但是，杜勒斯丝毫不能掩饰他这次造谣的目的是为了制造借口，准备进一步直接干涉印度支那战争，并为了加紧制造扩大印度支那战争的气氛，以便张罗“联合行动”，强迫法国和其他国家为美国火中取栗。杜勒斯公然说：“我并不抹煞”美国直接干涉印度支那战争的“可能性”；又说“我现在所谈到的唯一东西就是联合行动”。
    杜勒斯在这次演说中还是不敢直言所谓“联合行动”包括那些具体的冒险步骤，而只是要求“自由世界团结一致”，特别是要强使法国和它“紧紧地站在一起”。但是，美国已经展开了大规模的宣传运动，对杜勒斯的“联合行动”作着并不是没有根据的详细解释了。最近西方报纸盛传美国国务院正在进行纠合一些国家发表干涉印度支那战争的挑衅性“联合声明”的阴谋活动，就已得到了证实。美国国务院发言人在六日公开承认：杜勒斯一直在“与英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国和菲律宾等国的外交代表就目前东南亚的一般形势进行过磋商。”
    如果从法国、英国和其他国家舆论所反映的不安和不满来看，那就更加可以清楚地了解杜勒斯的“联合行动”究竟是些什么不可告人的罪恶计划。譬如，英国资产阶级的报纸“每日快报”就警告道：“我们是不是面临着第二个朝鲜了？杜勒斯要求在亚洲采取联合行动是严重的冒险”。法国资产阶级报纸“战斗报”更是愤慨地说：“在印度支那死亡的不是美国男儿而是法国士兵。……我们还需要忍受多少时间来用我们士兵的鲜血使华盛顿脱离困境呢。”
    不单这样。现在，杜勒斯更进一步地公然表明，美国“不仅在印度支那问题上”，“而且在许多问题上”，都要它的政策的追随者采取“联合行动”。这就是说，美国统治集团阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的目的，是要驱使许多国家继续放弃它们自己的利益和安全，追随美国维持远东和全世界的紧张局势，使美国垄断资本集团获得亿万利润。
    杜勒斯在他的演说中，就强调了“法—德团结
  一致”，法国和意大利迅速批准“欧洲防务集团条约”，复活德国军国主义势力的重要性。同时，杜勒斯表明了美国将毫无理由地拒绝苏联最近提出的赞成美国参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”和准备与有关国家共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题的建议。苏联这个建议受到了全世界特别是欧洲各国舆论的同情和支持，认为苏联的这个建议将有助于消除欧洲国家的分裂和对立，进一步促成欧洲集体安全体系的建立，但是，杜勒斯却诬蔑苏联“企图以渗入的办法来破坏北大西洋公约组织的团结和力量”。这就十分清楚地表明，美国统治集团继续要保持北大西洋公约的侵略的、排他的性质，以便在欧洲以及全世界继续维持敌对的和紧张的气氛。
    在当前的国际局势中，一个越来越明显的事实是：美国统治集团正在不遗余力地煽动战争气氛，以重新加剧国际紧张局势。在这种罪恶的活动中，美国国务卿杜勒斯扮演了主要的角色。杜勒斯以他作为美国外交政策的策划者和执行者的地位，最近不断发表演说，从美国“新面貌”的军事政策一直叫嚷到“自由世界”要在东南亚采取“联合行动”；从毫无根据地断言日内瓦会议可能延期一直到公然命令法国必须在越南继续作战。杜勒斯四月五日的演说，更毫无掩饰地把美国对全世界的军事侵略政策和盘托了出来。
    杜勒斯奉行的美国的“全面外交政策”，究竟包括些什么内容呢？在这个政策中，既根本谈不到促进各国间正常的经济和文化关系，也当然不会有诚意进行与其他国家之间的外交协商，而充满了的却是所谓“预先阻止”的“战略”、所谓“报复的力量”，以及军事基地、军事援助和在全世界各处建立的军事集团等等。绝不能说，杜勒斯完全不懂“外交”这个术语的含意，而他的美国“全面外交政策”实际上完全是军事侵略政策，这只能说明在美国统治集团的心目中，美国的对外关系，除了军事侵略和财政剥削以外就没有任何其他的考虑了。
    因此，不难了解，对于美国来说，世界上的其他国家，如果不是美国军事侵略的对象，就是它的军事侵略的工具。杜勒斯在他的演说中，明白地宣布了苏联和中华人民共和国是美国“预先阻止”“战略”所要“选择”“打击”的目标，而且只要所谓“自由国家”“建立一个广泛的集团体系的话”，美国就能取得这个“选择权”。因而，在美国的外交政策中，北大西洋侵略集团是“一个重要的成份”，欧洲防务集团的拖延状态“不能再继续下去”，土耳其和巴基斯坦的军事协定给其他国家建立了“可以仿效的先例”，而对于包括法西斯佛朗哥西班牙在内的欧洲的“自由国家”和包括南朝鲜、印度支那傀儡政权的亚洲的“自由国家”，美国都必须给以军事援助，以扩充“防御力量”，并继续取得军事基地。显然，杜勒斯在这里不但毫无掩饰地表露了他对中苏两国的敌意，而且也再次暴露了美国独霸世界的野心。
    人们由此可以看到：美国统治集团把国际关系歪曲到了多末可怕的程度，企图把国际气氛毒化到如何严重的地步。
    但是，美国统治集团不能不看到它漫天喧嚷的这种战争政策，由于违反世界各国的根本利益，正在引起越来越不妙的反响。于是，像杜勒斯之流的死硬人物，就越来越无法抑制自己的恼怒情绪了。杜勒斯在这次的演说中，又一次滥肆攻击对于长期屈从美国表示“不耐烦”甚至表示“抗议”的“每一个自由国家”，侮辱这些国家为了本身利益谋求出路是“莫名其妙的盲目看法，以及最荒唐的主观想法”。那末，照杜勒斯说来，只有驯服地听从美国把自己拖入绝路的国家，才能博得华盛顿老爷们的喝采了。
