Comrades Representatives, Comrades Distinguished Guests:

    The Angang Technical Innovation Exhibition is now officially opened in the capital. The Angang technical innovation movement has provided a correct direction for the national labor competition. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I would like to express my respect to all the workers, model workers, and leaders of Angang, and to the Soviet experts at Angang. At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude to all the comrades who have made their best efforts in preparing for this exhibition.

    The purpose of the Angang Technical Innovation Exhibition is to promote the advanced experience of Angang in innovating technology in production and capital construction, to promote the working class’s spirit of responsibility for socialist construction and its pioneering spirit in production technology, so as to further promote the nationwide labor competition, ensure the completion or over-completion of the 1954 national plan and the first Five-Year Plan, and accelerate the pace of the country's socialist industrialization.

    I am not going to talk much about the specific achievements of Angang in technical innovation here. I just want to emphasize the significance of the Angang technical innovation movement in the national labor competition, that is, the mass production movement.

    In order to successfully complete the national economic construction plan, it is necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff, and the purpose of giving play to this enthusiasm and creativity is to improve labor productivity. Only by continuously improving labor productivity can we accelerate the pace of the country's socialist industrialization. So how can we improve labor productivity? The most important and decisive way is to improve technology and gradually place our industrial production on a highly technical basis. Therefore, it is necessary to guide the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses towards technical innovation.

    Of course, when our factories, mines, transportation enterprises, and capital construction units have not yet completed democratic reforms, and when our enterprise management work is still relatively chaotic, the labor competition will inevitably be subject to some objective restrictions. But when these problems are gradually resolved, the labor competition can be fully and vigorously carried out. Therefore, since last year, the national labor competition has become more extensive and in-depth. After the labor competition is launched, it will inevitably require improvement and technical innovation. This is an objective trend. The Angang technical innovation movement represents this trend of the labor competition. Precisely because of this, after Zhang Mingshan created the anti-enclosure plate and Wang Chonglun created the universal tool die, the Angang technical innovation became a mass movement. After the Angang technical innovation movement was launched, many technical innovation achievements appeared all over the country.

    The Angang technical innovation movement represents the current direction of the labor competition, and its great significance lies here. Therefore, we should not only learn from Angang's many technical creations, but also learn from Angang's experience in leading the labor competition.

    The technical innovation movement is a popular and nationwide trend. The Angang technical innovation movement fully demonstrates the superiority of our people's democratic system, fully demonstrates the greatness of the collective wisdom of the working class, and fully demonstrates the preciousness of the Soviet Union's assistance to us. Angang's experience foreshadows the inevitable victory of China's economic construction.

    Let us forge ahead bravely under the shining of the Party's general line.

    Long live the People's Republic of China, which is advancing towards socialist industrialization! Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    在“鞍钢技术革新展览会”开幕典礼大会上
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚同志的开幕词
    各位代表、各位来宾同志：
    鞍钢技术革新展览会，现在正式在首都开幕了。鞍钢的技术革新运动给全国的劳动竞赛提供了一个正确的方向，我代表中华全国总工会向鞍钢的全体职工、劳动模范和领导同志表示敬意，向鞍钢的苏联专家们表示敬意。同时，对于在筹备这个展览会的工作中尽了最大努力的全体工作同志们表示感谢。
    鞍钢技术革新展览会的目的，在于推广鞍钢在生产方面和基本建设方面革新技术的先进经验，提倡工人阶级对于社会主义建设事业的负责精神和生产技术上的首创精神，从而把全国正在开展着的劳动竞赛向前推进一步，保证完成或超额完成一九五四年的国家计划和第一个五年计划，加速国家的社会主义工业化的进度。
    关于鞍钢在技术革新方面的具体事迹，我在这里不准备多谈，我只是着重地说一下鞍钢技术革新运动在全国的劳动竞赛即群众生产运动中的意义。
    为了胜利地完成国家经济建设计划，必须高度发挥工人、工程技术人员和职员的积极性、创造性，发挥这种积极性和创造性的目的是为了提高劳动生产率。只有不断地提高劳动生产率，才能加速国家的社会主义工业化的进度。那么怎样来提高劳动生产率呢？最主要的最有决定作用的办法是提高技术，把我们的工业生产逐步地安置在高度的技术基础之上。因此，必须把群众的积极性、创造性引导到技术革新方面来。
    当然，当我们的厂、矿、交通企业和基本建设单位还没有完成民主改革的时候，当我们的企业管理工作还比较混乱的时候，劳动竞赛一定会受到一些客观的限制。可是当这些问题逐步得到解决的时候，劳动竞赛就完全可能蓬勃地开展起来。所以自从去年以来，全国的劳动竞赛就更加广泛更加深入了。当劳动竞赛开展起来之后，就必然要求提高，要求技术方面的革新，这是一个客观的趋势。鞍钢的技术革新运动正是代表着劳动竞赛的这种趋势的。正因为如此，所以在张明山创造了反围盘、王崇伦创造了万能工具胎之后，鞍钢的技术革新就成为一个群众性的运动，在鞍钢技术革新运动展开之后，全国各地都出现了很多技术革新的事迹。
    鞍钢的技术革新运动，代表着当前的劳动竞赛的方向，它的重大意义就在这里。所以我们不仅对于鞍钢的许多技术上的创造要学习，对于鞍钢领导劳动竞赛的经验也要学习。
    技术革新运动是普遍全国的群众性的趋势，鞍钢的技术革新运动充分地表现了我国人民民主制度的优越性，充分地表现了工人阶级的集体智慧之伟大，充分地表现了苏联对我们的帮助之可贵。鞍钢的经验预示着我国经济建设的必然胜利。
    让我们在党的总路线的照耀之下奋勇前进。
      正在向着社会主义工业化前进的中华人民共和国万岁！中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
