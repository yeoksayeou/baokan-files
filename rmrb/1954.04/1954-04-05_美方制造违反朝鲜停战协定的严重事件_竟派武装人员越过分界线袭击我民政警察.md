Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 4th: On the evening of the 3rd, at approximately 8:45 PM, the U.S. side dispatched a small group of armed personnel to cross the Military Demarcation Line by more than 500 meters near Machang-ri, three kilometers east of Panmunjom, and launched an armed attack on our civilian police. The dense sound of carbine fire could be clearly heard in the Panmunjom Military Armistice Commission headquarters area. This constitutes a serious violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. One of the U.S. armed personnel who crossed the Military Demarcation Line to carry out the armed attack was killed by our civilian police, and one was captured alive. The rest fled back south of the Military Demarcation Line. Our side also seized two carbines.

The captured U.S. armed personnel, Kim Jong-geum, confessed: There were a total of five armed attackers this time, and they crossed the Military Demarcation Line around 7:00 PM on the 3rd. Their unit code name is "BMC".

The joint personnel of the Second Joint Observer Team will conduct an on-site investigation into this serious violation of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side at 2:00 PM today.

In the first three days of April alone, this is already the second incident in which the U.S. side has violated the armistice agreement on the ground. The first incident was on April 1st, when the U.S. side shelled our demilitarized zone near Mundung-ri on the eastern front. At approximately 13:00 on the 1st, a shell was fired from the U.S. area south-southwest of Mundung-ri and landed in our demilitarized zone 2.5 kilometers east-northeast of Mundung-ri, 400 meters northwest of Height 851. Three of our civilian police officers witnessed this personally. After the shell exploded, it created a crater with an area of about one square meter and a depth of about ten centimeters. The shape of the crater also indicates that the shell was fired from the U.S. area. Several shell fragments were scattered around the crater, and the wild grass within an area of seven square meters on the northern edge of the crater was burned by the flames caused by the shell's explosion.

This incident will also be investigated by the joint personnel of the Fifth Joint Observer Team this afternoon.

    美方制造违反朝鲜停战协定的严重事件
    竟派武装人员越过分界线袭击我民政警察
    【新华社开城四日电】三日晚上八点四十五分左右，美方派遣一支小股武装人员在板门店以东三公里马场里附近越过军事分界线五百余公尺，向我方民政警察进行武装攻击。稠密的卡宾枪声，在板门店军事停战委员会总部区清晰可闻。这构成了对朝鲜停战协定的严重违反。越过军事分界线进行武装攻击的美方武装人员被我方民政警察打死一人，生俘一人，其余逃回军事分界线以南，我方并缴获卡宾枪两支。
    被俘的美方武装人员金钟今供称：这次的武装袭击者共有五个人，于三日晚上七时左右就越过了军事分界线，他们的部队代号是：“BMC”。
    对这次美方严重违反停战协定的事件，第二联合观察小组的双方人员，定于今天下午二时进行现场调查。
    仅在四月份开始以来的三天中，这已是第二次美方在地面上违反停战协定的事件。第一次是在四月一日，美方在东线文登里附近炮击我方非军事区。一日十三时左右，从文登里正南偏西的美方地区射来一发炮弹，落于我方非军事区文登里东二公里半八五一高地西北四百公尺处。当时有我方民政警察三人亲眼看到。炮弹爆炸后，炸成面积约一平方公尺、深约十公分之弹坑。从弹坑的形状，也可以判明炮弹系自美方地区射来。弹坑周围散落有若干炮弹碎片，弹坑北缘七平方公尺面积内的荒草被炮弹爆炸时引起的火焰烧掉。
    这一事件也在今天下午由第五联合观察小组的双方人员进行调查。
