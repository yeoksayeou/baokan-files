    Correcting the Phenomenon of Wasting Locomotives

    Reader Tian Xiang writes: I am exposing to you the serious and unreasonable phenomenon of wasting locomotives at the Tianjin Railway Bureau. The Beijing Railway Bureau and the Tianjin Railway Bureau are two adjacent bureaus. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, trains departing from the Nancang Station on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway should be supplied with locomotives by the Beijing Bureau. In order to ensure the rational utilization of locomotives, the Beijing Bureau signed a contract with the Tianjin Bureau as early as March of last year to guarantee the accuracy of the daily plan. However, the Tianjin Bureau rarely considers changes in traffic flow when making daily plans, often creating inaccurate daily plans, which leads to the waste of locomotives. For example, the Tianjin Bureau's daily plan for February 25th stipulated that 20 trains should be handed over to the Beijing Bureau, but in reality, only 16 trains were handed over. It is common for locomotives arriving at stations within the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Bureau to be detained for six or seven hours. For example, on February 23rd, one locomotive was detained for more than nine hours, three locomotives were detained for more than seven hours, three locomotives were detained for more than six hours, and four locomotives were detained for more than five hours; while the train running time between Fengtai and Nancang is only two hours and thirty minutes according to regulations. What is more serious is that the Tianjin Bureau sometimes blindly requests locomotives from the Beijing Bureau. For example, at 6:00 AM on February 26th, the Beijing Bureau received a notice from the Tianjin Bureau and immediately dispatched a single locomotive to Tianjin. However, after the locomotive arrived at its destination, it was discovered that there were no freight cars to tow, so the single locomotive was sent back, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity.

    In order to better utilize locomotive efficiency, locomotive dispatchers from the Beijing Bureau suggested super-axle traction to the Tianjin Bureau, but Director Chen of the bureau rejected it with the excuse that "one locomotive cannot pull one hundred cars." In fact, trains departing from Tianjin often have the phenomenon of not being fully loaded. For example, on March 4th, train No. 2016 departing from Tianjin was underloaded by 459 tons, and train No. 2022 was underloaded by 469 tons, which is a serious waste of locomotive power.

    Accelerating locomotive turnaround is an important method of unleashing the potential power of railways. The Tianjin Railway Bureau's arbitrary waste of locomotives is clearly not in line with the interests of the state, and it is recommended that the Central Ministry of Railways inspect and correct it.

### 纠正浪费机车的现象

专栏：读者来信摘要

    纠正浪费机车的现象
    读者田翔来信：我向你们揭发天津铁路管理局浪费机车的严重不合理现象。北京路局和天津路局是相邻的两个局，按照铁道部的规定，京山线南仓站开出的列车应由北京局供给机车。为了使机车能合理运用，北京局早在去年三月间就与天津局订立了保证日计划准确的合同。可是，天津局在作日计划时很少考虑车流的变化，经常作出不正确的日计划，这样就造成了机车的浪费现象。例如天津局二月二十五日的日计划规定应交北京局二十列车，但是实际上只交了十六列车。机车到达天津局管内车站被扣压六、七个小时是经常的事。如二月二十三日那天，机车被扣压九小时以上的有一台，扣压七小时以上的有三台，扣压六小时以上的有三台，扣压五小时以上的有四台；而丰台南仓间的列车运行时间按规定仅为二点三十分。更严重的是天津路局有时还盲目地向北京局要机车。如二月二十六日晨六时，北京局接到天津局的通知，立即放单机至天津。可是机车到了目的地后，发现没有货车可拖，就又放了单机回来，造成运输力的浪费。
    为了更好地发挥机车运用效能，北京局机车调度员曾向天津局提出超轴牵引的建议，该局陈调度长竟以“一台机车拉不了一百辆车”为借口而拒绝了。实际上从天津开出的列车常常有不满轴的现象。如三月四日从天津开出的二○一六次列车欠装四百五十九吨，第二○二二次列车欠装四百六十九吨，浪费机车力量的情况很严重。
    加速机车周转率是发挥铁路潜在力量的重要方法。天津路局任意浪费机车的做法显然是不符合国家利益的，建议中央铁道部检查纠正。
