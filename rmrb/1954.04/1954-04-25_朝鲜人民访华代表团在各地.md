The Heroic Korean People's Representatives in a Military Dependents' Cooperative

	The news that the heroic Korean people's representatives were coming to visit had spread a few days earlier in the Lie and Military Dependents' Production Cooperative of the Second District of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. This good news further boosted their production enthusiasm. In the first five days of April, they completed their production tasks even more beautifully. The output of the weaving workshop averaged over eleven bolts of cloth per day, with the highest exceeding sixteen bolts.

	On April 6th, the heroic messengers of the Korean people finally arrived. How excited the families of the volunteers were to see the comrades who had fought alongside their loved ones! They applauded vigorously and cheered enthusiastically. Bai Junying, a model family member of a volunteer, and others accompanied them to visit the cooperative's sewing, yarn-twisting, and weaving workshops, as well as the nursery. In these workshops, model certificates and production instruction charts for the families of martyrs and soldiers were posted. In the sewing workshop, the representatives saw Pan Chun'e, a family member of a volunteer, working hard. Chairman Kim Eung-ki warmly shook her hand to express his regards. When the representatives arrived at the weaving workshop, they meticulously recorded how the military dependents carried out production according to the production instruction charts. As soon as they entered the nursery, they were surrounded by children. The children innocently shouted, "Hello, Korean uncles, aunts!" and sang loudly, "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River..." and "People of the world, unite tightly..." One child pulled the combat hero Ryu Man-soo, insisting that he sit on his small stool. The representatives held the children tightly in their arms and gave them bouquets of flowers. The children shouted, "Thank you, uncles and aunts!" Some of these children may no longer remember what their fathers looked like, but they all knew that their fathers were protecting their happiness, just as they knew that the heroic Korean people were also protecting their happiness.

The Joy of a Hero from the Awoji Mine

	Kim Jik-hyun, a Labor Hero of the Republic from the Awoji Mine in Korea, arrived at the Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Manufacturing Plant. This was the first factory he had seen since coming to New China. It was also one of the most ordinary factories in New China. Before liberation, it was just a repair shop for simple mining transport parts, but now it had developed into a specialized manufacturing plant for mining transport machinery. The total output value of the factory had increased thirty-six times, labor productivity had increased twelve times, and the profits turned over to the state had increased seven hundred times. Kim Jik-hyun visited the factory with great interest. He said, "The thought that the machines produced here will be transported to various mines to reduce the labor of the miners and increase the efficiency of mining makes me love this factory even more." The feelings of this Korean miner are understandable. He had spent more than ten years in the mine, laboring like a slave, and also tasted the joy of becoming his own master. In the most difficult times for the country, he and his comrades in the mine often had to dig coal with their own hands and carry coal on their backs. How he longed for excellent tools! Now, he saw them in China. He carefully wrote down the names of these machines in his notebook. He wanted to go back and tell his Korean worker brothers how excellent machines the Chinese worker brothers were making. He loved these excellent machines, and he loved the excellent workers who operated and created these machines even more. In front of a complex Soviet-made umbrella gear planer with automatic feed and retraction, Kim Jik-hyun stopped because Liu Huisheng, an eighteen-year-old female worker, was calmly operating it. Kim Jik-hyun also came to the side of the tube rolling machine created by Gu Zhanfang, the most famous labor model in the factory and also a labor model in Hebei Province. This tube rolling machine increased the original working efficiency by eleven times and saved the country 1.1848 billion yuan annually. More importantly, the appearance of the tube rolling machine promptly ensured the supply of chain tubes needed for the chain conveyor, solving a key problem in the factory's production. This experienced Korean miner looked at the machine and praised, "The Chinese worker brothers are very powerful."

Another Everlasting Red Flag

	Another unforgettable day—April 6th. On this morning, in the auditorium of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Kim Buk-won, Chairman of the Children's Literature Branch of the Korean Writers' Alliance, and youth Choi met with the children of Chongqing. During the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, the children of Chongqing, like children all over the country, had made their best efforts. In December 1951, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and other organizations issued a joint appeal, calling on children to work hard on one thing during the 1952 Spring Festival—to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The children of Chongqing responded to this call. More than 57,000 children were organized, and they comforted more than 10,000 families of martyrs and soldiers around the Spring Festival of that year. In this comfort activity, the Rao Shihe group of Dongshenglou Elementary School won a national excellent group award. Rao Shihe presented this award to Choi, asking him to take it to all the students in his school and class. Tu Changxin, the class chairman of the "Kim Il-sung Class" of Chongqing No. 9 Middle School, also presented the "Kim Il-sung Class" badge to Choi. At this time, a sixteen-year-old girl walked onto the stage with a red flag in her hands, handed it to Choi, and asked him to take it to the heroic Korean people. They shook hands tightly for a long time, and people responded with sustained applause. The girl's name was Chen Shuli, chairman of the Chongqing Women's Normal School Student Union. It turned out that the students of this school usually had frequent contact with the Korean people. In 1951, they made a red flag and entrusted the first Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to bring it to Korea. The red flag fell into the hands of the soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army. At that time, it was the eve of the second stage of the Fifth Campaign, and this company received a new combat mission: to insert itself into the enemy's rear to cut off the enemy's retreat. The battle was fierce. Some soldiers fell, the company commander was also wounded, and the enemy was still desperately attacking the hill they had inserted into. Qian Jiyuan, the labor party branch committee member of the Eighth Company, raised the red flag and shouted: "All party members, all comrades! Please look at this red flag! More than 500 million great Chinese people are with us, fighting bravely for the motherland!" The brave warrior Qian Jiyuan was wounded, and Park Yong-seok, the deputy committee member of the company's labor party branch committee, took over the red flag. Park Yong-seok also fell, and the labor party group leader Wen Minglu immediately took over the red flag. The red flag always fluttered in the smoke and fire, and victories came one after another. In twelve hours of fierce fighting, they repelled eleven group charges by the enemy, killing and wounding more than 200 enemies. The hill still stood firmly, and the red flag still fluttered proudly.

	The heroic Korean people won the victory in the war and are now rebuilding their homeland. Now, the students of Chongqing Women's Normal School have presented another red flag to the envoy of the heroic Korean people as a gift to the Korean people who are rebuilding their motherland. The red flag reads: "Salute to the heroic Korean people who have displayed unparalleled labor enthusiasm for building a great motherland." The red flag is also signed by all the teachers and students of the school, expressing their determination to support the Korean people in rebuilding their homeland. The red flag will soon arrive in heroic Korea; the red flag will always fly on the land of Korea!

A Get-Together in Lianhu Park

	On April 12th, the lilac flowers in Lianhu Park in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, were in full bloom. On this day, the members of the Korean Art Troupe who visited Xi'an with the Korean People's Delegation to China and the literary and art workers of Xi'an gathered here.

	Cao Jing, an actress from the Korean National Art Theater, met the famous actress Liu Yanping as soon as she entered the park. They met and became friends at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Berlin, and they met again in Xi'an today. Like sisters, they walked into the park shoulder to shoulder with everyone. The entire park immediately became lively. By the lake, in the pavilions, under the dense crabapple trees, and in the blooming lilac bushes, there was passionate conversation, joyful laughter, and cheerful singing everywhere. The painter Zhao Wangyun painted a pair of galloping horses on the spot, with two strong hunters riding on them, and gave them to Xu Yulin, director of the Fine Arts Department of the Korean National Classical Art Theater, and said to him: "The theme of this painting expresses the people of China and Korea advancing side by side." Xu Yulin took the painting with both hands and said in broken Chinese, "What you painted is exactly the same as what I imagined." Choi Nam-in, a Korean artist standing beside him, grabbed Zhao Wangyun's hand and pointed to himself, indicating that he also wanted one. Zhao Wangyun immediately painted a camel. The camel was walking slowly in the vast desert, and the Qilian Mountains were faintly visible in the distance. On the right corner of the picture was written: "Bearing heavy responsibilities to achieve great goals."

	In a corner of the tea shed, the Korean painter Cao Yun chatted kindly with the 75-year-old Zhang Hanshan. Cao Yun could not speak Chinese, but with his fluent Chinese characters, he could perfectly express his wishes. He wrote on paper, "Have you seen Su Dongpo's 'Plum Blossoms on Ba Bridge'?" and handed it to the old gentleman Zhang Hanshan, who told him the story of "Plum Blossoms on Ba Bridge" in great detail. In the end, Cao Yun asked Zhang Hanshan to write an inscription for him as a souvenir of today's conversation. Zhang Hanshan wrote casually: "Artists from China and Korea, shaking hands and rejoicing in Xi'an, we warmly wish the immortal victory of the people of China and Korea; long live Marshal Kim Il-sung! Long live the Korean people!" (Attached picture)

    朝鲜人民访华代表团在各地
    在一个军属生产合作社里
    英雄的朝鲜人民代表要来访问的消息，几天以前，就在山西省太原市第二区烈军属生产合作社里传开了，这个喜讯更加鼓舞了他们的生产热情。四月份的前五天内他们的生产任务完成得更漂亮了，织布车间的织布量平均每天超过了十一匹，最高的超过了十六匹。
    四月六日，英雄朝鲜人民的使者终于来了。志愿军军属看到了曾和自己亲人一块打击敌人的战友，该是多么兴奋啊。他们使劲地鼓掌，热烈地欢呼。志愿军模范军属白俊英等陪同他们参观了合作社的缝纫、合线、织布三个车间和托儿所。在这些车间里，都贴着烈军属的模范奖状和生产指示图表。在缝纫车间里，代表们看到志愿军家属潘春娥紧张工作的情形，金应基团长就和她热烈地握手，表示慰问。代表们到达织布车间时，都详细地记下了军属们如何按照生产指示图表进行生产的情形。他们一走进托儿所，就被孩子们围拢起来。孩子们天真地喊着：“朝鲜伯伯、叔叔、姨姨们好！”还高声唱着“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江……”，唱着“全世界人民团结紧”……。一个孩子拉着战斗英雄柳万洙，一定要他坐在自己的小凳子上。代表们把孩子们紧紧地抱在怀里，又把一束束的鲜花送给他们，孩子们喊着：“谢谢伯伯、叔叔、姨姨！”这些孩子，有的可能已经记不清自己爸爸的样子了，但是他们都知道爸爸在保卫着自己的幸福，正像他们知道英雄的朝鲜人民也在保卫着自己的幸福一样。
    阿吾地矿山英雄的喜悦
    来自朝鲜阿吾地矿山的共和国劳动英雄金直铉到了张家口的矿山机械制造厂。这是他来到新中国以后看到的第一个工厂。这也是新中国最普通的工厂。解放以前，这只是修理一些简单的矿山搬运零件的修配厂，现在已经发展到成为矿山运输机械专业化的制造厂了。厂里的生产总值提高了三十六倍，劳动生产率提高了十二倍，上缴给国家的利润竟增加了七百倍。金直铉带着最大的兴趣来参观这个工厂。他说：“一想到这里生产的机器，将要运送到各个矿山去减轻矿工们的劳动，增加矿山的开采效率，就更喜爱这个工厂了。”这位朝鲜矿工的心情是可以理解的。他在矿山整整待了十多年，奴隶般地劳动过，也尝过翻身作主人的喜悦。在祖国最艰难的时候，他和矿山的同志们常常不得不用自己的双手来挖煤，用背来背煤。他是多么渴望着出色的工具啊。如今，他在中国看到了。他仔细地在本子上记下了这些机器的名字，他要回去告诉朝鲜的工人兄弟，中国的工人弟兄制造了多么出色的机器。他爱这些出色的机器，他更爱操纵和创造这些机器的出色的工人。在一架最复杂的苏联制造的自动进刀和退刀的伞齿刨前面，金直铉停住了，因为一位十八岁的女工刘惠生在不慌不忙地操纵着它。金直铉又来到这个工厂最著名的劳动模范，也是河北省的劳动模范顾占芳所创造的卷管机的跟前了。这架卷管机提高了原有工作效率十一倍，每年为国家节约财富十一亿八千四百八十万元。更重要的是卷管机的出现，及时保证了锁链运输机所需链子管的供应，解决了这个工厂生产上的关键问题。这位有经验的朝鲜矿工一面看着机器，一面赞美着：“中国的工人兄弟大大的有力量。”
    又一面永远不落的红旗
    又是一个难忘的日子——四月六日。这天上午，在青年团重庆市委员会的大礼堂里，朝鲜作家同盟儿童文学分科委员会委员长金北原、青年崔?和重庆市的少年儿童们见面了。在抗美援朝运动中，重庆市的孩子们，和全国小朋友一样，都尽了自己最大的努力。一九五一年十二月，中国人民抗美援朝总会等机关发出了联合号召，号召孩子们在一九五二年的春节努力作好一件事——慰劳革命的烈军属。重庆市的小朋友们也就响应了这一号召。五万七千多个少年儿童们组织起来了，他们在那年的春节前后，向一万多户烈军属进行了慰问。在这次慰问活动中，东升楼小学饶世河小组荣获了全国优秀小组的奖状。饶世河把这张奖状赠给了崔?，要崔?带给他所在学校所在班的全体同学。重庆市第九中学“金日成班”的班主席涂长新也把“金日成班”的徽章赠给了崔?。这时，一个十六岁的姑娘双手拿着一面红旗走上了主席台，交给崔?，托他带给英雄的朝鲜人民。他们长久地紧紧地握手，人们也报以持续的掌声。姑娘的名字叫陈淑立，是重庆女子师范学生会的主席。原来这个学校的学生平常就和朝鲜人民有着经常的联系。一九五一年，她们曾做了一面红旗，托中国人民第一届赴朝慰问团带到了朝鲜，红旗落到了朝鲜人民军某部第八连战士的手中。那时，正是第五次战役第二阶段的前夜，这个连队接到了新的战斗任务：插到敌人后方去切断敌人的退路。战斗激烈地进行着。有的战士倒下去了，连长也负了伤，敌人还在拚命地向他们插入的那个山头进攻。八连的劳动党支部委员长千吉元高举起那面红旗喊道：“全体党员、全体同志们！请看这面红旗吧！五亿以上伟大的中国人民和我们在一起，为祖国勇敢地战斗啊！”勇士千吉元负伤了，连劳动党支部委员会的副委员长朴容石又接过了红旗；朴容石也倒下去了，劳动党小组长文明律立即把红旗接过来。红旗始终在硝烟弹雨中飘扬，胜利一个接着一个来临。十二小时的激烈战斗，他们打退了敌人十一次的集团冲锋，毙伤敌人二百多名，山头依然屹立未动，红旗仍然在骄傲地飘扬着。
    英雄的朝鲜人民赢得了战争的胜利，在恢复重建自己的家园了。现在，重庆市女子师范的同学们，又以一面红旗赠给了英雄朝鲜人民的使者，作为对重建祖国的朝鲜人民的献礼。红旗上面写着：“向为了建设伟大的祖国发挥无比劳动热情的英雄朝鲜人民致敬。”红旗上还签署着全校师生的名字，表示他们支援朝鲜人民重建家园的决心。红旗很快就会到达英雄的朝鲜；红旗，将永远飘扬在朝鲜的土地上！
    在莲湖公园的联欢
    四月十二日，陕西省西安市莲湖公园的丁香花盛开着。这一天随朝鲜人民访华代表团到西安访问的朝鲜艺术团人员和西安文艺工作者在这里欢聚了。
    朝鲜国立艺术剧场演员曹敬，一进公园的门就遇见了著名演员刘燕萍。她们在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节时认识并结为朋友，今天在西安又见面了。她们就像亲姊妹一样，肩并肩地和大家一块涌进公园。整个公园立刻活跃起来了，在湖边，在亭子里，在茂密的海棠树荫下，在盛开的丁香花丛中，到处是纵情的谈话，愉快的笑和欢乐的歌声。画家赵望云当场画了一对奔腾的骏马，马上骑着两个强壮的猎人，赠给了朝鲜国立古典艺术剧场美术部部长徐玉麟，并对他说：“这个画题，表示中朝两国人民并肩前进。”徐玉麟双手接过画来，用不熟练的中国话说道：“你画的和我理想的完全一样。”站在一旁的朝鲜美术家蔡南仁，一把拉住赵望云的手，指一指自己，表示也要一幅。赵望云又立刻画了一峰骆驼。骆驼在广袤的沙漠中缓步行进，远远隐现着祁连山。画面的右角上写着：“任重致远”。
    在茶棚的一角，朝鲜画家曹云和七十五岁高龄的张寒杉亲切地交谈着。曹云不会说中国话，但借着他那一笔流利的中国字，却能完善地表达出他的意愿。他在纸上写了“苏东坡的‘灞桥观梅’见过没有？”一句话，递给张寒杉老先生，张寒杉就给他源源本本地讲述着有关“灞桥观梅”的故事。谈到最后，曹云请张寒杉就今天的谈话给他题词留念，张寒杉随手写道：“朝中两国艺术家，在西安握手言欢，我们热烈地敬祝朝中两国人民不朽的胜利；祝金日成元帅万岁！朝鲜人民万岁！”（附图片）
