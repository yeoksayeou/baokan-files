    Universal Suffrage Completed in Hunan Province with a Population of Over 32 Million
    The grass-roots elections in Hunan Province have come to an end. According to statistics from the Hunan Provincial Election Committee as of April 7th, with the exception of some townships and towns in the three counties of Tongdao, Huaihua, and Chengbu that have not been completed, grass-roots elections have been completed in more than 15,500 grass-roots units, covering an area with a population of approximately 32 million, and people's congresses have been established as organs of political power.
    The broad masses of voters in Hunan Province participated in the election activities with extremely high enthusiasm. Approximately 90% of the electorate participated in the voting. Many Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, heads of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team leaders, and well-known agricultural labor models in rural areas have been loved and trusted by the voters. Among those elected as people's representatives of townships or counties are Kang Juying, the famous female head of an agricultural production cooperative in the province; Li Shouguang, the head of an agricultural production cooperative; Qi Jingxiu, a female Communist Youth League member who won the Ministry of Agriculture's Patriotic Bumper Harvest Medal from the Central People's Government in 1952; and Luo Diekai, the father of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao. Many original rural grass-roots cadres who have led peasants in land reform and organized production development over the past four years have also been elected as people's representatives. The people of Shaoshan Township in Xiangtan County, the hometown of Chairman Mao, and the people of Wushi Township in Xiangtan County, the hometown of General Peng Dehuai, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as the people in the old revolutionary base areas of more than 1,200 townships and towns in twenty-four counties including Pingjiang, Liuyang, Dayong, and Yongshun, which have a glorious history of struggle, participated in the election activities with even greater joy. Many outstanding veteran revolutionary fighters have received great trust from the voters. Wang Shulan, the wife of the revolutionary martyr Mao Zemin and an old Communist Party member, was elected as a people's representative of Shaoshan Township. Chen Jiayun, a veteran Red Army soldier who was one of the "Eighteen Good Men" who persisted in the struggle in Lishuidong, Pingjiang County, from 1927 to 1937, was elected as a people's representative of Lutou Township, Pingjiang County, with an extremely high number of votes, and was elected as the head of the township.
    The workers in various industrial and mining areas elected the most outstanding figures in industrial construction as their representatives in the universal suffrage. Wu Fushou, a labor model from the Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Factory, was elected as a people's representative with 98% of the votes. Some young women who recently came to the newly built Xiangtan Textile Factory from rural areas excitedly cast their votes for their happy lives. The voters of the Miao, Yao, and other fraternal ethnic groups in western and southern Hunan participated in the election activities with incomparable joy. In many electoral districts of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Miao voters went to participate in the elections on the election day, beating sanbang drums and singing mountain songs. Some townships where the Miao and Han ethnic groups live together also formulated ethnic unity pacts at the first township people's congress. The boat people on Dongting Lake and the Xiangjiang River also solemnly fulfilled their civic obligations. When the Shuishang District of Changde City conducted the election, all the boats raised national flags and set off firecrackers to express their congratulations.
    At present, the first township people's congresses have been generally held in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province, and the first district people's congresses have also been held in the cities. At the meetings, members of the township and district people's government committees were elected respectively. (Xinhua News Agency)
