    A Batch of Difficult-to-Produce Carts
    Readers Wu Dehua and An Qing wrote: The Beijing Transportation Electrical Equipment Company accumulated a large number of slow-selling car tires last year. A comrade suggested using these tires on carts, and this suggestion was accepted. The company's sales team undertook orders for 100 military transport carts for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and 600 civilian transport carts for the Henan Provincial Cooperative, totaling 11.2 billion yuan, with the contract stipulating that all deliveries would be completed by the end of January this year.
    When the ordering units came to inspect the goods at the end of January this year, the company couldn't deliver a single cart. It turned out that Director Han Zuoxin of the wholesale department casually put the order contract in the file cabinet after receiving it and completely forgot about it. When things reached this point, Han Zuoxin brazenly offered a pile of "objective difficulties" to the ordering units. Finally, he promised to deliver all 100 carts to the unit by February 15th; as for the 600 carts ordered by the Henan Provincial Cooperative, he tried his best to delay, and the matter remains unresolved to this day.
    After this incident occurred, Han Zuoxin did not learn a lesson and continued to take a careless attitude towards his work. According to the contract, these carts should be equipped with brakes; however, Han Zuoxin did not mention the need for brakes when arranging the manufacturing of the carts. It was not until February 13th, when the processing team inspected the carts, that they discovered the problem and asked Han Zuoxin for instructions. Han Zuoxin said carelessly, "If there are no brakes, then there are no brakes." On February 15th, when someone from the unit came to inspect the carts, they were very dissatisfied to find that there were no brakes. They criticized the company's dishonest business practices and requested government assistance in resolving the issue. Government departments sent cadres to contact Manager Duan Yidong of the company to urge him to solve the problem promptly; however, Manager Duan was unaware of the delay in this matter. By March 5th, the brakes for all 100 carts had not been fully produced, and the unit had to first accept 50 carts with brakes installed, and returned the rest.
    This incident illustrates the serious confusion in the work of the Beijing Transportation Electrical Equipment Company and the irresponsible work style of Wholesale Department Director Han Zuoxin. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau should conduct an inspection and deal with this matter and earnestly improve future work.

    一批难产的大车
    读者巫德华、安青来信：北京市交通电工器材公司在去年积压了大批滞销的汽车轮胎。有一个同志建议把这批轮胎用在大车上，这个意见被接受了。该公司推销组在去年十二月份就承揽了人民解放军某部一百辆军用运输大车和河南省合作总社六百辆民用运输大车的订货，价值共一百十二亿元，合同规定于今年一月底全部交货。
    今年一月底，订货单位来验货时，该公司竟交不出一辆大车来。原来批发部韩作新主任拿到订货合同后就随手放进档案柜子里，根本忘了这回事。事情到了这种地步，韩作新就硬着头皮向订货单位提了一大堆“客观困难”，最后，答应某部在二月十五日前把一百辆大车交齐；对河南省合作总社订的六百辆大车，则尽量推拖，事情至今尚未解决。
    这件事情发生后，韩作新并没有接受教训，对工作仍然采取了马马虎虎的态度。按合同规定，这批大车应当装闸；但是韩作新在布置制造大车的工作时却没有提出要装闸。直到二月十三日加工组检验时才发现了这个问题，就向韩作新请示。韩作新却毫不在意地说：“没有闸，就没有闸。”二月十五日某部派人来验收大车时，发现没有闸，很不满意，指责了该公司这种不老实的经营态度，并要求政府协助解决。政府部门派干部与该公司段毅东经理联系，督促他抓紧时间解决；而段经理对这件事的拖延却毫无所知。到三月五日，一百辆大车的车闸还没有全部生产出来，某部只好先收了五十辆已装闸的大车，其余的退货了。
    这一事件说明北京市交通电工器材公司工作中的混乱现象，和批发部主任韩作新的不负责任作风是十分严重的。北京市人民政府商业局应该对此进行检查和处理，并切实改进今后的工作。
