    Before the discussion, Shenin, Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Council of the Union, gave a supplementary report on the report of Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev. Shenin's supplementary report attached great importance to issues related to improving the work of various departments of the national economy, completing production plans and improving labor productivity targets, reducing production costs, and improving product quality.

    The first speaker in the discussion was Kalchenko, Chairman of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers. While describing the progress of Ukrainian industry and the development of productive forces, he said that the construction plan of the Kakhovka Hydropower Station is being overfulfilled, and the hydropower station can start generating electricity in 1955.

    Matzurov, Chairman of the Byelorussian Council of Ministers, described the efforts of the Byelorussian people to implement the communist construction plan. He said that the Byelorussian Republic completed 103 percent of the 1953 production plan.

Furtseva also talked about the situation of housing construction and public utilities and cultural institutions construction in Moscow. This year, Moscow will build houses with a construction area of 900,000 square meters, twelve hospitals, and forty-two schools.
