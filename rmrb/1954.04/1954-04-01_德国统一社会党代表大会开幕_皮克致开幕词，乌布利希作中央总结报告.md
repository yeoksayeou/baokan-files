Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 31st: The Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) opened in Berlin on March 30th. On this day, the working people of Berlin decorated the streets and squares of the democratic sector of Berlin to express their love for the Party, and thousands of residents stood on the streets to congratulate the delegates attending the Party Congress. At 9 a.m., the delegates gathered in the grandly decorated Werner Seelenbinder Hall.

Wilhelm Pieck, on behalf of the Central Committee of the SED, announced the opening of the Party's Fourth Congress. He proposed that all stand in silence to mourn Stalin and the German workers' movement activists who had passed away in recent years. All delegates stood.

Pieck then delivered the opening address. He pointed out that the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference showed that the peaceful settlement of the German question was primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. With the Soviet Union establishing diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic on the same basis as with other sovereign states, the role of the German Democratic Republic as the base for the all-German people's movement striving for national unification and the conclusion of a democratic peace treaty has become even greater.

Pieck said: Our German Democratic Republic is the base for building a democratic and independent Germany without imperialists and militarists. Therefore, the working class and all working people of our republic have a better opportunity than others to serve the national cause of the German people, which is to consolidate and strengthen the worker-peasant power and vigilantly safeguard and resolutely defend it. Pieck said to the representatives of the fraternal parties attending the congress, we assure you that the SED will do everything possible to ensure that aggressive German militarism can never again threaten the people of Europe. Pieck called on the delegates to the congress to intensify the struggle for Germany's unification and peace, and to work hard to consolidate and strengthen the worker-peasant power of the German Democratic Republic. The whole hall responded with a storm of applause.

The congress elected its leading bodies. The members of the Politburo of the Party Central Committee, headed by Pieck, Grotewohl, and Ulbricht, leaders of the Party's local organizations, activists on the production front, labor heroes, recipients of state prizes, and well-known scientists were unanimously elected into the presidium. Pieck also suggested inviting the representatives of the fraternal parties present to participate in the presidium.

When the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union delegation, Mikoyan, Suslov, Shepilov, and Smirnov, the representative of the Communist Party of China, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic Ji Pengfei, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democracies, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Pollitt, the Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria, Koplenig, and the representatives of the Communist Parties of Italy, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and other countries, as well as other individuals, stepped onto the stage, the hall resounded with a storm of cheers. When the delegation of the French Communist Party, headed by Waldeck Rochet, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, appeared on the stage, the congress delegates responded with warm and prolonged applause.

The congress elected the credentials committee, the drafting committee, the committee for revising the Party Constitution, and the auditing committee. The agenda of the congress was as follows: 1. Summary report of the Central Committee (reporter: First Secretary of the SED Central Committee Ulbricht); Summary report of the Central Auditing Commission (reporter: Oesner); Summary report of the Party Control Commission of the Central Committee (reporter: Matern); 2. Revision of the SED Constitution (reporter: Karl Schirdewan); 3. Election of the Party's central leading bodies.

After electing the presidium and various committees, the congress heard the summary report given by Ulbricht. On the evening of the 30th, the meeting also heard the reports of the Central Auditing Commission and the Party Control Commission of the Central Committee.

    皮克说：我们德意志民主共和国是建立一个没有帝国主义分子和军国主义分子的民主独立的德国的基地。因此，我们共和国的工人阶级和所有劳动人民比别人有更好的机会为德国人民的民族事业服务，这就是巩固和加强工农政权，警惕地维护和坚决地捍卫这一政权。皮克对参加大会的兄弟党的代表说，我们向你们保证，德国统一社会党将尽一切努力使侵略性的德国军国主义永远也不能威胁欧洲人民。皮克号召大会的代表们：加紧为德国的统一与和平而斗争，努力巩固与加强德意志民主共和国的工农政权。全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    大会选举了领导机构。被大家一致选入主席团的有以皮克、格罗提渥、乌布利希为首的党中央委员会政治局委员、党的地方组织的领导人、生产战线上的积极分子、劳动英雄、国家奖金得奖人、著名的科学工作者。皮克并建议邀请到会的各兄弟党的代表参加主席团。
    当苏联共产党代表团代表米高扬、苏斯洛夫、谢皮洛夫、斯米尔诺夫，中国共产党代表、中华人民共和国驻德意志民主共和国大使姬鹏飞，各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党的代表，英国共产党总书记波立特，奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希以及意大利、希腊、西班牙、瑞士、比利时、芬兰、瑞典、丹麦、挪威等国共产党代表及其他人等走上主席台时，场内响起了暴风雨般的欢呼。当以法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇为首的法国共产党代表团出现在主席台上时，大会代表报以热烈的、经久不息的掌声。
    大会选出了资格审查委员会、编纂委员会、修改党章委员会、审计委员会。大会议程如下：一、中央委员会总结报告（报告人德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希）；中央检查委员会总结报告（报告人厄斯纳）；中央委员会党的监察委员会总结报告（报告人马特恩）；二、修改德国统一社会党党章（报告人卡尔·希德万）；三、选举党的中央领导机构。
