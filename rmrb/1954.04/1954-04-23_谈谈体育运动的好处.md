    On the Benefits of Sports
    Rong Gaotang, Secretary General of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission

    In the past few years, thanks to the care and advocacy of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, people's sports have greatly developed. However, from the perspective of the needs of the country and the people, the development of sports is still far from sufficient. Many people still have incorrect understandings of sports, believing that sports are just "playing ball" and "holding sports meets," and have not understood the political significance of carrying out sports activities and their scientific value for enhancing people's physical fitness.

    The Party Central Committee has instructed: "Improving the people's health and strengthening the people's physique is an important political task of the Party." Especially at a time when we are striving to achieve the country's socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense, we need people with healthy bodies even more. A healthy body is a favorable condition for further improving the efficiency and quality of various tasks. As far as we know, the poor health of people in some areas is seriously affecting production, work, and study. To change this situation, we should of course start from many aspects, such as improving labor conditions and strengthening health work, which are all very important. However, carrying out sports activities is indeed a positive and scientific method. Because sports can promote blood circulation and metabolism in the human body, enhance the functions of various organs and muscles, enable all parts of the body to develop in a comprehensive and balanced way, increase the ability to resist diseases, and especially can exercise the brain and nervous system, and enhance thinking and memory abilities. According to our investigations, whether it is a factory, mine, school, army unit, or government agency, units that have carried out regular physical exercise can improve the people's health, reduce the incidence of diseases, and improve labor efficiency. The famous Soviet scientist Lepeshinskaya said: "Only by developing all forms of sports and making sports more popular can we achieve new achievements in the struggle to extend the life of the Soviet people who are building a communist society."

    Sports can also help cultivate people's courage, perseverance, quick wit, ability to overcome difficulties, optimism, and collectivism. To become a truly courageous person, in addition to a high degree of political consciousness, one must also have certain material conditions. Sports can provide people with the material conditions to realize a firm and courageous will. For example, if you have the courage to pursue the enemy, you must have the material conditions to pursue the enemy in order to achieve your goal. If you want to go into the water to save someone, it is not enough to have a lofty will; you must know how to swim.

    Intense sports can exercise the cerebral cortex to more flexibly direct the nerves and muscles of the whole body through the nervous system, making the various organs of the human body more alert and flexible, and enabling people to make judgments, make decisions, and take appropriate actions in an instant. Playing basketball is an intense and vigorous sport. A good basketball player can not only quickly receive a ball suddenly passed from any angle, but also quickly and accurately pass the ball to the appropriate person or shoot to win. This extremely rapid and complex exercise cultivates the material basis for extremely rapid conditioned reflexes, enabling people to be alert and flexible in dealing with things. This kind of exercise has a good effect on any other work.

    Sports are also helpful for cultivating collectivism. Take the Hungarian football team as an example: One of the main reasons why they have become a victorious and highly skilled team is that they have a high degree of collectivism. Each of their players has a high degree of individual skill, but in the game, no athlete is ever seen trying to show off personal skills and forgetting the collective. Whoever runs to the most advantageous position gets the ball, coordinated action, and plays a high degree of organization, discipline, and collectivism, giving full play to the collective strength.

    Regular physical exercise can also cultivate people into optimistic people with strong confidence in any work. Sports are an interesting activity. Who can be sad when exercising? We are now building socialism, and we will build communism in the future. Communism is happiness, and although the content of happiness is rich and diverse, one aspect of it is physical health. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De said at the first plenary session of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission: "From a personal point of view, good health is the greatest wealth." This is very correct.

    Of course, cultivating people's excellent qualities mainly depends on political education, and sports can only prepare a better material basis for cultivating these qualities. Correct political and ideological education must be implemented in sports training.

    Some people who engaged in sports in the old society were "healthy in body but simple in mind." The "simple in mind" mentioned here mainly refers to not asking about politics and not asking about serious matters. In fact, the athletes of the old society were not stupid; they had very good physical conditions, but they did not or could not use them in the right way. This was the result of reactionary rule, not a problem of sports itself. After liberation, the situation has greatly changed. Many outstanding athletes are skilled workers in production and models in learning. For example, Gu Seyun, who won the women's 3,000-meter bicycle race at the 1953 North China Sports Meet, is an advanced producer in the Tianjin 405 Factory. Li YuKe, a member of the North China Women's Basketball Team, and Zhu Hala, a member of the Northwest Women's Volleyball Team, who participated in the 1953 National Basketball and Volleyball Tournament, are both excellent students who often get fives.

    Sports can also enrich and enliven people's cultural life and are a healthy and beneficial amateur cultural activity for the working people. The material life of our people is improving day by day with the continuous development of the country's economic construction, and people demand multifaceted cultural activities, and sports are precisely an activity that people love. Some factories and mines have very active amateur cultural life for their employees because sports activities are well developed. More than 70% of the employees of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Dalian participate in various sports activities such as radio calisthenics, ball games, and field trips. There are sports competitions every holiday and festival, and thousands of employees often visit the competitions. The workers said: "Sundays are now easier to spend." The deputy director of the factory believes that "sports have become an indispensable part of the employees' lives, everyone is happy and active everywhere, and the mood for production is also high."

    So, why do many people still not sufficiently recognize the value of sports? This is mainly because we have not publicized it enough, have not clearly explained the political significance of sports, and have not quickly changed and corrected the various incorrect views on sports left over from the old society and newly generated.

    Chinese old society has long advocated white-faced scholars who have no strength to restrain a chicken and "Lin Daiyu"-style characters, and despised physical activity and labor. In recent decades, although some people have advocated sports, they have been deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, making sports an entertainment or commodity activity for a few people. This traditional influence still plays a big role among the people. Therefore, some people still feel embarrassed to participate in sports activities, thinking that this is not elegant enough. Or some people see that some young people have broken a little skin and suffered a little injury because they participated in physical exercise, and they exclaim "danger." Even more people think that sports are just for fun, and it is okay to have them or not. Some even think that sports hinder production. These are all erroneous views left over from the old society.

    There is also an incorrect view generated in the new environment that should be overcome. After the liberation of our country, the people of the whole country are working hard to build a new country, and the task is indeed extremely heavy. Therefore, some people, especially the heads of some grassroots units, believe that "if production is not done well, they will be criticized and punished, but if sports activities are not done well, no one will ask." Therefore, they do not care about sports work. This is the result of not planning for long-term interests. It is wrong to disregard the health of the masses in order to complete production, work, and study tasks. Moreover, sports not only do not conflict with production, work, and study, but can also enable people to better complete their work. In fact, the busier you are, the more you should pay attention to your health, just as the busier the machine is, the more you should pay attention to protection and maintenance. Therefore, the broad masses of people should participate in physical exercise. The senior and middle-level cadres of our country should also engage in certain sports activities to keep their bodies healthy and better lead the people of the country in building our motherland.

    In order to realize the great and glorious task of our country's socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense, we should fully develop the physical and mental strength of our people. We should more widely carry out mass sports activities and make them correctly serve the consolidation of national defense and the construction of a socialist society.

    谈谈体育运动的好处
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长 荣高棠
    几年来，由于党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀与倡导，人民的体育运动有了很大发展，但是从国家和人民的需要来说，体育运动的开展还是很不够的。不少人对体育运动还存在着不正确的认识，他们认为体育运动就是“打打球”、“开开运动会”，没有了解开展体育运动的政治意义及其对增强人民体质的科学价值。
    党中央指示：“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务。”特别是在我们正在为实现国家社会主义工业化和国防现代化而奋斗的时期，更需要人民有健康的身体。健康的身体是进一步提高各项工作效率和工作质量的有利条件。据我们所知，目前有些地方人民健康不良的状况，严重地影响着生产、工作和学习。要改变这种情况，当然应从多方面着手，如改善劳动条件，加强卫生工作等都很重要。但是，开展体育运动确是一种积极的科学方法。因为体育运动可以促进人体血液循环和新陈代谢作用，增强各种器官和肌肉的机能，使身体各部得到全面平衡的发展，增加抵抗疾病的能力，特别是能锻炼大脑和神经系统，增强思维和记忆能力。根据我们的调查，不管是厂矿、学校、部队或机关，凡是进行了经常的体育锻炼的单位，就能够改善人民的健康状况，减少疾病率，提高劳动效率。苏联著名的科学家勒柏辛斯卡娅说：“只有发展一切形式的体育，使体育变得更加群众化，我们才能在争取延长建设共产主义社会的苏联人民的寿命的斗争中，达到新的成就。”
    体育运动还能帮助培养人们的勇敢、坚毅、机敏、克服困难、乐观主义和集体主义的精神。要成为真正勇敢的人，除了高度的政治觉悟，还得有一定的物质条件。体育运动能供给人们以实现坚决勇敢的意志的物质条件。例如你有勇气追击敌人，你必须具备追击敌人的物质条件，才能达到目的。你要下水救人，光有崇高的意志还不够，必须会游泳。
    进行紧张的体育运动，能锻炼大脑皮质通过神经系统更灵活地指挥全身的神经和肌肉，使人体各种器官更加机敏和灵活，使人们在刹那间能下判断、下决心和做出应有的处置。打篮球就是一种紧张而激烈的运动。一个好的篮球运动员不仅能迅速地接到从任何角度突然传来的球，而且可以迅速、准确地把球传给适当的人或投篮取胜。这种极为迅速又复杂的运动锻炼，使人们养成极为迅速的条件反射的物质基础，对待事物就能机敏、灵活。这种锻炼对于其它任何工作都有良好的作用。
    体育运动对于培养集体主义精神也是有帮助的。以匈牙利足球队为例：他们所以能成为百战百胜、技术高超的球队，其中一个很主要的原因就是他们具有高度的集体主义精神。他们的每个队员都有高度的个人技术，但在比赛中，从未见到一个运动员想炫耀个人的技巧而忘记集体，谁跑到最有利的地位就把球给谁，协同动作，发挥高度的组织性、纪律性和集体主义精神，充分发挥了集体力量。
    经常进行体育锻炼，还能培养人们成为对任何工作具有坚强信心的乐观的人。体育运动是一种有趣味的活动。有谁在运动的时候能够愁眉苦脸呢？我们现在正建设着社会主义，将来还要建设共产主义。共产主义就是幸福，幸福的内容尽管是丰富而多样的，但其中的一个方面就是身体的健康。朱德总司令在中央体育运动委员会第一次全体委员会议上曾说：“从个人来说，身体好也就是最大的财富。”这是非常正确的。
    自然，培养人们的优良品质，主要要靠政治教育，体育运动只能为培养这些品质准备更好的物质基础。在体育运动的训练中必须贯彻正确的政治思想教育。
    旧社会从事体育运动的人，有些是“身体健康，脑筋简单”。这里所说的“脑筋简单”，主要是指不问政治，不问正事。其实，旧社会的运动员并不笨，他们有很好的身体条件，不过是没有或者不能用到正路上去罢了。这是反动统治的结果，不是体育运动本身的问题。解放后，情况就有很大改变。有许多优秀运动员都是生产上的能手和学习的模范，如获得一九五三年华北区体育运动大会女子三千公尺自行车比赛冠军的顾瑟云，就是天津市四○五厂的先进生产者。参加一九五三年全国篮、排球比赛大会的华北区女子篮球队员李玉珂和西北区女子排球队队员朱哈拉，都是经常得五分的优秀学生。
    体育运动还可以充实和活跃人民的文化生活，是劳动人民的一种健康的有益的业余文化活动。我国人民的物质生活随着国家经济建设的不断发展而一天天提高了，人们要求多方面的文化活动，而体育运动正是人们所喜爱的一种活动。有些厂矿因体育活动开展得很好，职工的业余文化生活就很活跃。旅大金州纺织厂参加广播体操、球类、野游等各种体育活动的职工在百分之七十以上，每个假日和节日都有运动竞赛，参观竞赛的职工往往有好几千人。工人说：“现在星期日也好过了。”该厂副厂长认为“体育运动已成为职工不可缺少的生活内容，大家精神愉快，到处活跃，生产情绪也高”。
    那么，为什么目前还有很多人对体育运动的价值认识不够呢？这主要是由于我们宣传得不够，没有把体育运动的政治意义说清楚，没有很快地改变和纠正那些旧社会所遗留下来的和新产生的各种对体育运动的不正确的看法。
    中国旧社会曾长期推崇手无缚鸡之力的白面书生和“林黛玉”式的人物，轻视体力活动和劳动。近几十年来，虽然有人提倡体育，但又深受资产阶级影响，使体育运动成为少数人的娱乐或商品式的活动。这种传统的影响在人民中仍起着很大的作用。因此就有些人至今还觉得不好意思去参加体育活动，认为这不够文雅。或者有的人看到某些青年由于参加体育锻炼跌破了一点皮，受了一点伤，就大呼“危险”，更有不少人认为体育运动就是玩玩的事，有无皆可，甚至以为运动妨碍生产等。这些都是旧社会所遗留下来的错误的看法。
    还有一种在新环境下产生的不正确看法也应克服。我们国家在解放后，全国人民都在努力进行建设新国家的工作，任务确是繁重极了。因此，就有人，特别是某些基层单位的负责人，认为“生产搞不好要受批评、受处分，体育活动搞不好，无人问”，因此不管体育工作。这是没有从长远利益打算的结果。为了完成生产、工作和学习任务而不顾群众健康的想法是不对的，何况体育运动不仅不与生产、工作和学习相矛盾，而且能使人们更好地完成工作。其实，工作越忙就越应该注意身体，就像机器越忙越应该注意保护和检修一样。因此，广大人民群众都应该参加体育锻炼。我们国家的高级和中级干部也应该进行一定的体育活动，使自己的身体保持健康，更好地领导全国人民建设我们的祖国。
    为了实现我们国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化的伟大而光荣的任务，应该充分发展我国人民的体力和智力。我们应当更广泛地开展群众性的体育运动，并使之正确地为巩固国防和建设社会主义社会服务。
