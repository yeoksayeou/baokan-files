Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: According to Vietnam News Agency on March 31st, Lao Resistance Government Foreign Minister Noha Phoumsavan issued a statement protesting the U.S. imperialists' direct interference in the Indochina war of aggression. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Since 1945, U.S. imperialists have aided the French colonialists in various ways in carrying out the war of aggression in Indochina, causing the war to continue incessantly. The people of Laos, like the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, have suffered many war disasters.

    U.S. imperialists have recently further directly interfered in the war in Indochina.

    In Laos, American pilots flying American planes have bombed areas in the provinces of Luang Prabang, North Xin, and Xiangkhouang, burning villages and massacring innocent residents. U.S. imperialists have sent military advisors to help the French colonialists and puppet traitors plan to expand the war of aggression in Laos.

    In addition to transporting weapons from Thailand into Laos to help the French colonialists, U.S. imperialists, under the pretext of establishing a Buddhist anti-communist alliance of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, have recently been using Thai reactionaries to plot aggression against Laos.

    The direct and open actions of U.S. imperialists in interfering in Laos not only violate the independence and freedom of the Lao people but also threaten world peace.

    I, on behalf of the Lao Resistance Government and the Lao people, strongly protest against the U.S. imperialists' interference in the Indochina war of aggression.

    The people of Laos, like the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, welcome the decision of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to convene the Geneva Conference on April 26, 1954, to seek to restore peace and national independence in Korea and Indochina, as it is in line with the wishes of the Lao people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    At the same time, the Lao people fully agree with the statements issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 8, 1954, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Cambodian Resistance Government on March 20, 1954.

    The Lao people, closely united around the Lao government headed by Chairman Souphanouvong, strengthen their solidarity with the people of Vietnam and Cambodia, and resolutely oppose French aggression and U.S. interference in order to achieve true independence, unity, freedom, and peace.

    抗议美国干预印度支那侵略战争
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社三十一日讯：寮国抗战政府外交部部长诺哈·冯沙万发表声明，抗议美帝国主义者直接干预印度支那的侵略战争。声明全文如下：
    自从一九四五年以来，美帝国主义者多方面帮助法国殖民者在印度支那进行侵略战争，使得战争不断继续下去。寮国人民像越南与高棉人民一样，遭受到许多战争的灾祸。
    美帝国主义者最近更进一步地直接干涉印度支那的战争。
    在寮国，美国驾驶员驾着美国飞机在琅勃剌邦省的北新与桑怒省的川库进行轰炸，焚烧村庄和屠杀无辜居民。美帝国主义者派了军事顾问帮助法国殖民者和傀儡卖国贼们策划在寮国扩大侵略战争。
    除了把武器从泰国运入寮国来帮助法国殖民者外，美帝国主义者还以建立一个泰国、高棉和寮国的佛教反共联盟为借口，最近一直在利用泰国的反动派阴谋侵略寮国。
    美帝国主义者直接和公开干涉寮国的行动，不仅侵犯寮国人民的独立与自由，而且也威胁世界和平。
    我代表寮国抗战政府和寮国人民强硬抗议美帝国主义者干预印度支那的侵略战争。
    寮国人民像越南和高棉人民一样，欢迎柏林四国外长会议关于在一九五四年四月二十六日召开日内瓦会议来设法恢复朝鲜和印度支那的和平与民族独立的决议，因为它是符合于寮国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人们的愿望的。
    同时，寮国人民也完全同意越南民主共和国政府外交部部长在一九五四年三月八日和高棉抗战政府外交部部长在一九五四年三月二十日发表的声明。
    寮国人民紧密地团结在以苏发努冯主席为首的寮国政府的周围，加强与越南和高棉人民的团结，坚决反对法国的侵略和美国的干涉，以取得真正的独立、统一、自由与和平。
