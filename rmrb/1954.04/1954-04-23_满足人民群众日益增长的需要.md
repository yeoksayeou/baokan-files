Meeting the People's Growing Needs

    An Ice-Covered Warehouse
    Not far from Beishan in Jilin City, the Jilin City Company of the China Native Produce Company has newly built an ice-covered warehouse. In this "crystal palace"-like warehouse, a temperature of minus one to three degrees Celsius is constantly maintained, which can hold five carriages of eggs or two carriages of pork. With it, the people of Jilin City can eat fresh fish, meat, eggs and other non-staple foods even during the "dog days".
    The construction of this ice-covered warehouse began at the end of December last year. Workers from the Fourth Team of the Second Construction Company of Jilin City, in the severe cold of the "Third Nine" and "Fourth Nine" periods, lifted slippery blocks of ice weighing more than 500 kilograms from ice piles more than six feet high to the roof of the ice cellar more than three zhang high. On March 10, the ice-covered warehouse was successfully built. Now this ice-covered warehouse, which is eight-ninths cheaper than building a mechanized cold storage of the same size, has begun to serve the non-staple food supply work in Jilin City.

    Umbrellas and Palm-leaf Fans are Continuously Transported to the Capital
    Spring has come to the capital not long ago, and the umbrellas, sleeping mats, and palm-leaf fans purchased by the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative for the people of the capital have arrived; folding fans, straw slippers, mosquito nets, and summer cloth shirts have also been shipped from Shanghai, Chongqing, Zhejiang and other producing areas. The number and variety of summer goods purchased by the Beijing Company of the China Native Produce Company this year have increased compared with last year. The "Da Tianjin Umbrella", "Gao Dou Umbrella", and "Ouyang Umbrella" purchased in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and the "Ming You Umbrella" purchased in Yiyang, Hunan, totaled 270,000, including 20,000 small floral umbrellas favored by women. Pillow mats, which were not purchased last year, have also been prepared this year with 60,000 pieces. At present, sleeping mats, Wenzhou umbrellas, and Guangdong palm-leaf fans are being shipped to Beijing one after another. The Handicraft Products Department of the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also commissioned handicraft households in Beijing to process a batch of bamboo curtains, rattan carts, straw hats, fly swatters, and cold cloth.
    Let the People on the Grasslands Live a Better Life
    The Guisui Wholesale Supply Station of the China Department Store Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently organized more than 100 kinds of commodities to supply the people on the grasslands. Among them are the famous satin in red, yellow, purple and other colors produced in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi and other places, which are loved by the Mongolian people, the various colors of silk from Zhoucun, Shandong Province, and the "Mongolian Dragon Knife", cigarette holder, and cigarette pipe specially made for the Mongolian people by the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company, as well as rock sugar, biscuits and other foods most loved by the Mongolian people. These things were welcomed by the Mongolian people, who happily said: "You are so thoughtful, you even brought us knives and chopsticks." The station also specially prepared canned beef and mutton for the Hui people, as well as various headscarves worn by Hui women and satin leggings worn on their legs. In order to better serve the supply work of various ethnic groups, they will organize special personnel to investigate and understand the needs of Mongolian, Han, Hui and other ethnic groups.

    Goods Loved by the Tibetan People
    Since the Spring Festival, the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Branch of the Gansu Provincial Trade Company has actively supplied the Tibetan people with a large number of goods they love, such as Hada, various colored cotton silks, and brick tea. As the weather warms up in spring, herdsmen have to pursue water and grass and move their tents. The company has planned to supply the Tibetan people in pastoral areas with a batch of urgently needed daily necessities such as copper pots, iron spoons, and wool shears. Before and after the start of spring plowing, the company also supplied Tibetan people in agricultural areas such as Da Xiahe and Xincheng with a batch of agricultural tools such as iron shovels, hoes, winnowing fans, and sieves. Many Tibetan people praised: "This year, the trade company's goods are really all-inclusive!" (Zhang Ruyun)
    A Large Batch of Summer Goods Arrived in Xinjiang
    In order to meet the needs of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in a timely manner, the Northwest District Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company transferred summer goods in advance. Starting in February, the company transferred a large amount of Shilin cloth, bleached cloth, fancy serge, striped cloth, red cloth, etc. to Dachaigou, Gansu, in advance, and then transferred them by truck to cotton yarn and cloth wholesale stores in Urumqi and Yanqi and other places in Xinjiang; various cotton cloths that should have been transferred in April were also transferred in advance in March. The company also paid attention to the preferences of various ethnic groups in the flower patterns and color matching of these cotton cloths. For example, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang like small flower serge, especially those with red, green, purple and other colors as the background color. Based on this need, the company appropriately increased the purchase volume of small flower serge. (Zhang Baolin)
    Holding a Seasonal Clothing Sample Exhibition
    From March 18th to 28th, the Andong City Company of the China Department Store held a seasonal clothing sample exhibition in the company's first store to widely solicit opinions from people of all classes on spring and summer clothing. More than 430 kinds of samples were exhibited at the meeting. More than 20,000 people visited the exhibition and put forward more than 800 opinions. Now the company is actively carrying out the processing of seasonal clothing based on these opinions. Through this exhibition, many enterprises, institutions, schools and department stores have also signed collective order contracts.
    Exhibiting Flower Cloth Samples in the Countryside
    Business personnel from Shanghai state-owned textile industry and state-owned commerce and flower cloth pattern designers, carrying a large number of flower cloth samples, held a "Printed Cloth Sample Exhibition" in Xinjian Township, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province on April 7, 8, and 9 to solicit opinions from farmers on the design, production and supply of flower cloth. It was the first time in Shanghai that flower cloth samples were exhibited in the countryside and met directly with farmers. More than 590 kinds of dark and light flower cloth samples were exhibited at the exhibition. More than 1,500 farmers visited the exhibition. Design personnel and supply staff also visited four agricultural mutual aid groups and held discussions with women representatives and mutual aid group leaders from eleven villages in Xinjian, Changbin, and Zhitong townships to understand their needs and preferences for flower cloth. The workers who design the patterns have collected the opinions put forward by the farmers and are preparing to use them as the basis for designing new patterns in the future.

    Supplying Farmers with Kerosene Lamps in a Planned Way
    In the past, farmers in Shanxi Province mostly used vegetable oil lamps, but now some farmers like to switch to kerosene lamps. Combining the supply of kerosene, the Shanxi Branch of the China Petroleum Company supplies farmers with various kerosene lamps in a planned way. This year, they established processing and ordering relationships with two handicraft production cooperatives and a glass factory in Taiyuan City, and organized them to process and produce hanging lamps, chandeliers, table lamps, and hand-held lamp fixtures. In addition, they also sent people to Tianjin, Shanghai and other places to purchase. This year, the company plans to supply four times more kerosene lamps than the actual sales last year; 75,000 lamps have been sent to various places in the first quarter.

    Supplying Farmers with Medicines Suitable for the Summer Season
    The Jiujiang City Branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company Jiangxi Province, supplies farmers with a large number of summer medicines. These summer medicines, such as Rendan and Ten Drops of Water, are medicines that farmers need to take when the weather is sultry and when they have heatstroke. In addition, there are also insecticides such as 666 and DDT, which are welcomed by farmers.
    These summer medicines, with the active improvement of workers, have not only improved in quality, but also greatly reduced costs. The prices of general medicines have decreased by an average of about 25% compared with the same period last year. (Gao Jianping)
      Transporting Hogs to Forest Areas for Breeding
  The state-owned native produce supplier store in Dunhua Forest Area, Jilin Province, transported a large number of hogs to the forest area for breeding. This year, workers in the Dunhua Forest Area will eat more fresh pork.
    Breeding a large number of hogs in the forest area has many convenient conditions: there are many scattered woods in the mountain gullies, which can be used to build pig sheds; the leftover food from the workers in the forest area and the tofu residue from the tofu workshops in the forest area are enough to be used as feed for the pigs. Currently, the weather is cool, and the hogs are not prone to illness when they are transported to the mountains and forests. Based on these conditions, the Dunhua Forest Area Native Produce Supplier Store and various forest industry bureaus jointly studied and decided to transport 1,230 hogs to the forest area. Currently, 720 hogs have been transported to various forest areas, and the rest can be transported by early May.

    满足人民群众日益增长的需要
    一座冰盖的仓库
    在吉林市北山前不远的地方，中国土产公司吉林市公司新建筑了一座冰盖仓库。在这座“水晶宫”般的仓库里，经常保持着摄氏零下一度到三度的温度，可以容纳五车厢鸡蛋或者两车厢猪肉。有了它，吉林市的人民在“三伏天”也可以吃到新鲜的鱼、肉和鸡蛋等副食品了。
    这座冰盖仓库是在去年十二月末开始动工的。吉林市第二工程公司第四队的工人们，在“三九”、“四九”的严寒天气里，把一块块滑溜溜的五百多斤重的冰块，从六尺多高的冰垛上抬到三丈多高的冰窖顶棚上去。三月十日，冰盖仓库胜利筑成。现在这座比修建同样大小的机械化冷藏库便宜九分之八的冰盖仓库，已在开始为吉林市副食品供应工作服务了。                               （来国生等）
    雨伞、葵扇源源运到首都
    春天来到首都不久，北京市供销合作总社为首都人民采购的雨伞、凉席、葵扇已经到货；摺扇、草拖鞋、蚊帐、夏布衬衫等，也已由上海、重庆、浙江等产地起运了。中国土产公司北京市公司今年采购的夏令货，数量、品种都比去年增加。在浙江温州采购的“大天津伞”、“高斗伞”、“瓯阳伞”和在湖南益阳采购的“明油伞”，就有二十七万把，其中又有两万把妇女喜欢用的小花伞。去年没有采购的枕席，今年也准备了六万条。目前，凉席、温州雨伞及广东葵扇正陆续赶运来京。北京市供销合作总社手工业品经理部还在北京委托手工业户加工了一批竹帘、藤车、草帽、苍蝇拍和冷布。
    让草原上的人们生活得更美
    中国百货公司内蒙古自治区归绥批发供应站最近组织了一百余种的商品，供应草原上的人们。其中有蒙族人民喜爱的南京、杭州、无锡等地出产的驰名的红、黄、紫等色的缎子，山东省周村的各色绸子，和首都特种工艺公司专为蒙族人民特制的“蒙古纹龙刀”、烟袋嘴、烟袋头，还有蒙族人民最爱吃的冰糖、饼干等食品。这些东西受到了蒙族人民的欢迎，他们高兴地说：想的真周到，连刀子、筷子也给我们运来了。该站还专门为回民准备了牛、羊肉罐头，和回民妇女们头上扎的各种头纱，以及腿上扎的缎腿带等用品。为了更好地作好各民族的供应工作，他们将组织专人，调查了解蒙、汉、回等民族的需要。                                  （王　温）
    藏族人民心爱的货物
    春节以来，甘肃省贸易公司甘南藏族自治区分公司积极供应了藏族人民以大批哈达、各色棉绸、砖茶等心爱的货物。春季天暖，牧民们要追寻水草，迁移帐篷，该公司有计划地供应了牧区藏民一批急需的铜锅、铁勺、羊毛剪子等生活用品。在春耕开始前后，该公司还供应给大夏河、新城一带农业地区的藏民一批铁锨、镢头、簸箕、筛子等农具。许多藏民称赞说：“今年贸易公司的货物真是样样俱全！”
    (张汝芸）
    大批夏令商品运到了新疆
    中国花纱布公司西北区公司为了及时满足新疆各兄弟民族需要，提前调运夏令商品。该公司从二月份起就把大量的士林布、漂白布、花哔叽、条格布、红布等提前调运到甘肃打柴沟，然后再用汽车分别转运到新疆的乌鲁木齐和焉耆等地花纱布批发商店；四月份应调运的各种棉布也在三月份提前调拨完了。该公司对这些棉布的花型、配色等，也都注意了各兄弟民族的爱好，如新疆省各族人民喜欢小花哔叽，尤其是喜欢底色是红、绿、紫等颜色，该公司就根据这一需要，适当的增加了小花哔叽的进货量。　（张宝林）
    举办换季服装样品展览会
    中国百货公司安东市公司于三月十八日到二十八日，在该公司第一商店举办了换季服装样品展览会，广泛征求各阶层人民对春、夏季服装的意见。会上展览的样品有四百三十多种。参观的人有两万多，提出了八百多条意见。现在该公司正在根据这些意见，积极进行换季服装的加工工作。通过这次展览，还有许多企业、机关、学校和百货公司签订了集体订货合同。
    下乡展览花布样品
    上海国营纺织工业和国营商业的业务人员和花布花样的设计人员，携带大批花布样品，在四月七、八、九三日到江苏省松江县新建乡举行了一次“印花布样品展览会”，征求农民对花布设计、生产和供应的意见。花布样品下乡展览，和农民直接见面，在上海还是第一次。展览会展出了深色浅色花布样品五百九十多种。参观展览会的农民有一千五百多人。设计人员和供应工作人员还到四个农业互助组进行访问，和新建、长滨、志同三乡十一个村的妇女代表、互助组长等举行座谈会，了解她们对花布的需要和爱好。设计花样的工作者们已把农民所提的意见汇集起来，准备作为今后设计新花样的依据。（据新华社讯）
    有计划地供应农民煤油灯具
    山西省的农民过去多是点植物油灯，现在有些农民喜欢换用煤油灯。中国石油公司山西省分公司结合供应煤油，有计划地供应农民各种煤油灯具。今年他们在太原市和两个手工业生产合作社、一家玻璃厂建立了加工、订货关系，组织他们加工生产挂灯、吊灯、座灯和手提灯的灯具，另外还派人到天津、上海等地采购。今年该公司计划供应煤油灯具的数量比去年实销数增加四倍；第一季度已发往各地七万五千盏。                （山西省石油分公司通讯组）
    供给农民暑季适用的药品
    中国医药公司江西省九江市支公司，大量供应农民暑季药品。这些暑季药品，如仁丹、十滴水等，都是农民在天气闷热时和中暑时所要服用的成药。另外，还有六六六、滴滴涕等农民欢迎的杀虫药品。
    这些暑季药品，在工人们积极改进下，不但质量有所提高，而且也大大降低了成本，一般药品价格比去年同期平均下降了百分之二十五左右。                                  （高剑萍）
      把毛猪运到林区饲养
  吉林省敦化林区的国营土产供应商店将大批毛猪运到林区饲养。今年敦化林区的工人，将吃到更多的新鲜猪肉。
    在林区大批饲养毛猪，有很多方便条件：山沟里的零碎木材多，可搭猪棚；林区工人吃剩的饭和林区豆腐坊的豆腐渣足够作喂猪的饲料。目前天气凉爽，毛猪往山林里运时，也不易生病。根据这些条件，敦化林区土产供应商店和各森林工业局共同研究，决定要运到林区一千二百三十口毛猪，目前已运到各林区七百二十口，其余的可在五月上旬全部运到。
