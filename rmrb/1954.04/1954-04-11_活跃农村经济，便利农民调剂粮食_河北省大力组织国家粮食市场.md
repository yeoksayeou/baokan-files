Activating the Rural Economy and Facilitating Grain Adjustment for Farmers
Hebei Province Vigorously Organizes National Grain Markets

[Our Newspaper] Various levels of People's Governments in Hebei Province are actively organizing national grain markets, which have played a significant role in stimulating the rural economy, facilitating grain adjustment among farmers, and supporting spring plowing and production.

After Hebei Province completed its planned grain purchase work, grain transactions in some areas stagnated for a time due to a lack of comprehensive and in-depth publicity of national grain policies. The exchange of materials in the primary markets was once at a standstill. Many farmers believed that selling grain after the state's unified purchase of grain was "very dishonorable." As a result, households with surplus grain and households lacking grain could not help each other, and farmers needing to adjust grain varieties did not do so. Many rural flour mills and tofu workshops in some areas also suspended work for a time due to a lack of raw materials.

In light of this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Governments at all levels promptly organized forces to comprehensively publicize the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain to the farmers, explaining that the state clearly stipulates that farmers can sell grain beyond their public grain and planned purchase quotas to the state or trade in the national grain market, and can conduct a small amount of mutual exchange in rural areas. At the same time, they systematically and under leadership began to establish national grain markets. As of March 25th, according to incomplete statistics, the province had organized 582 national grain markets.

After the national grain markets were organized in various places, they greatly facilitated the adjustment of grain among farmers and activated the rural economy. For example, since the opening of the Dongchangshou Grain Market in Xinle County on January 18th, the amount of grain entering the market on each market day has gradually increased from 20 to 30 jin to more than 12,000 jin. According to preliminary statistics as of March 22nd, the total amount of grain entering the market was more than 116,300 jin, of which more than 75,700 jin was mutually adjusted by the masses. The activity of the national grain market has also solved the raw material problems of many tofu workshops and flour mills. In more than two months, 62 tofu workshops in the Second District of Xinle County purchased and exchanged 24,300 jin of beans, producing and supplying a large quantity of tofu. The Handan Special District originally estimated that the state needed to supply 250,000 jin of edible oil during the Spring Festival. Because national grain markets were established, oil mills were able to buy sesame in these markets, and as a result, only 130,000 jin needed to be supplied.

    活跃农村经济，便利农民调剂粮食
    河北省大力组织国家粮食市场
    【本报讯】河北省各地人民政府积极组织国家粮食市场，对活跃农村经济，便利农村调剂粮食，支持春耕生产起了很大作用。
    河北省各地完成粮食计划收购工作以后，有些地区由于没有全面地深入宣传国家粮食政策，粮食交易一度陷于停顿，初级市场物资交流一度呈现停滞状态。许多农民认为在国家统购粮食以后再出卖粮食“很不光彩”，因此，余粮户和缺粮户不能互通有无，需要调剂粮种的农民也不进行调剂。部分地区的许多农村粉坊、豆腐坊也因缺乏原料，一度停工。
    河北省中共各级党委和各地人民政府根据这一情况，及时组织力量向农民全面地宣传了粮食统购统销政策，说明国家明确规定，农民向国家缴纳公粮和计划购粮以外的粮食，可以卖给国家或到国家粮食市场进行交易，并可在农村进行少量的互通有无的交易；同时有计划有领导地着手建立国家粮食市场。截至三月二十五日不完全的统计，全省已组织了五百八十二个国家粮食市场。
    各地国家粮食市场组织起来以后，大大便利了农民调剂粮食，并活跃了农村经济。如新乐县东长寿粮食市场从一月十八日开市以来，每个集日粮食上市量由二、三十斤逐渐增加到一万二千多斤，截至三月二十二日的初步统计，上市粮食共十一万六千三百多斤，其中群众互相调剂的有七万五千七百多斤。国家粮食市场的活跃，也解决了许多豆腐坊、粉坊等的原料问题。新乐县第二区六十二个豆腐坊在两个多月内购换豆子二万四千三百斤，生产和供应了大批豆腐。邯郸专区原来估计春节期间国家需要供应食油二十五万斤，因为建立了国家粮食市场，油坊能在这些市场上买到芝麻，结果只供应十三万斤就够了。
