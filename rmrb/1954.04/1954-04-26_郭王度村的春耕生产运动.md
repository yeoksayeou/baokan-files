    Spring Plowing Production Campaign in Guo Wangdu Village
  　By our reporter Lü Jianzhong
    Guo Wangdu Village in Anyang County, Henan Province, is a cotton-producing area. Here, because the leadership combined political and policy education of the peasants well with the current specific work, it not only reversed the peasants' idea of reducing cotton fields and expanded the cotton fields according to the state plan, but also, with the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative as the core, promoted the entire spring plowing production campaign of the village.

    The peasants here have significantly improved their socialist consciousness in the study of the general line. They deeply understand the importance of developing industry and consolidating national defense; and they eagerly look forward to the early realization of agricultural mechanization and a happy socialist life. However, they did not have sufficient understanding of the significance of the people's government's call to expand cotton fields at the beginning. They believed:
  “Selling cotton is not as glorious as selling grain.” At the same time, they were also afraid of low cotton prices and that cotton could not be used to pay public grain, so they once planned to reduce this year's cotton fields by more than one-third.

    The village work group of the CPC Anyang Prefectural Committee and the village branch of the CPC adopted a lively educational method of organizing peasants to visit the Yubei Textile Factory and holding a get-together with workers, which gave the peasants a profound lesson.
      The workers of the Yubei Textile Factory warmly welcomed them, guided them to visit the entire production process, and held a discussion. Worker representatives introduced the factory's production situation to them, not to mention the entire year's production value of the workers, only from September to November last year, the factory workers found tricks, tapped potential, and overcame various difficulties, and increased production and saved 27.8 billion yuan for the country. They calculated on the spot: If this money is used to support agricultural production, it can buy 130 tractors or 26,000 Liberation-style waterwheels.

    The peasants were surprised and delighted to see that the spinning machines were cast with words such as "Made by Shanghai or Tianjin Factory." They said, "So our China can also manufacture such good machines!" The workers explained to them: The textile industry in old China was manipulated by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Peasants grew cotton but could not afford clothes. The textile industry in new China is to meet the needs of the people across the country, especially the vast number of peasant brothers, who have turned over and the demand for textiles is increasing day by day. Therefore, the textile industry needs to develop rapidly. Therefore, workers are trying to research and manufacture these spinning machines. Not to mention the whole country, the Yubei Textile Factory has now developed from 12,000 spindles in 1950 to 50,000 spindles. The cotton produced by Guo Wangdu Village in a year is only enough for this factory to spin for two to three days. Therefore, it is a very important and glorious task for peasant brothers to expand cotton fields and sell cotton to the state.

    The visiting peasants were deeply moved because these situations were related to their personal lives. It is precisely because they used the new agricultural tools made by the workers and improved production technology that the cotton yield of the entire village gradually increased from 60 jin per mu in 1949 to 263 jin per mu in 1952, more than three times higher than before liberation; it is also because the country's textile industry has developed and the price of cloth has decreased, most of the young people in the village can now wear new clothes, and more than 100绒衣were bought last year alone. In the past, they always thought that workers eat well, wear well, and live comfortably in buildings, while they themselves worked hard from morning till night, working in wind and rain. Therefore, they couldn't figure out why they should expand cotton fields. Now they realized that their thinking was too narrow and their vision was too short. It turns out that expanding cotton fields and selling cotton to the state is precisely to realize the country's industrialization, use tractors, and live a happy socialist life as soon as possible. Guo Zhenyu, whose father was killed by the Japanese devils, used to have some opinions about the workers. Now he was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. He muttered a review to the workers. On the night of returning to the village, his family discussed how to expand cotton fields and strive to increase production, and how to run their agricultural production cooperative well amid the praise of the workers throughout the village.

    At the same time, the work group and the village branch also combined the above-mentioned political and ideological education to publicize the grain-cotton price ratio policy to the peasants and implemented the grain supply policy. They recalled that the people's government has stipulated reasonable cotton-grain price ratios over the years. This year, according to the people's government's regulations, each jin of 8.7-inch medium-grade fine-fleece lint can be exchanged for 7.5 to 8.4 jin of millet locally, which is higher than the cotton price last year. According to their calculations, if each mu produces an average of 85 jin of lint, it can be exchanged for 1,000 jin of coarse grains, which shows that planting cotton is also profitable. At the same time, the work group also conscientiously implemented the policy of unified grain purchase and sales. In order to help cotton farmers solve the difficulties in production, the people's government also implemented advance purchase of cotton, and stipulated the policy of "equal burden on cotton fields and grain fields in financial collection, and cotton fields using cotton to pay public grain." After the peasants in the village understood these policies, they happily expressed: "The country needs to plant cotton, and it is also beneficial to ourselves. The government's policies meet our requirements, and we will resolutely expand cotton fields." Peasant Zhu Huaiming originally planned to reduce planting one mu of cotton. After visiting the spinning mill and learning about the policies, he not only did not reduce planting, but also mobilized the mutual aid group to expand cotton fields. As a result, the village's cotton fields not only did not decrease, but increased by 60 mu, and the mutual aid and cooperation organizations also developed greatly. The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative led by township party secretary Lu Daoping expanded from 26 households to 143 households. The peasants' enthusiasm for production has been greatly promoted with the improvement of their political and ideological awareness. At this time, how to further guide the peasants' enthusiasm into the actual actions of spring plowing production and make the village's mutual aid and cooperation organizations more consolidated has become a central link. The work group and the village branch were not complacent in the face of achievements. They timely researched a set of practical "four investigations and four calculations" work to mobilize the masses to make full and specific preparations for spring plowing production. This work was first created by the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative and promoted. The members discussed that the veteran workers made such great contributions to the country and that production was so disciplined and planned. They should also learn from them. So they discussed the cooperative's production plan and formulated labor discipline for the members to jointly abide by. But how to ensure the realization of the production plan? This led to further investigation of what problems existed in the cooperative. The results showed: There was a shortage of fertilizer. Cotton fields needed 1,200 carts of base fertilizer, but only 700 carts were available, and 500 carts were still needed; There was a shortage of seeds. Cotton fields needed 8,000 jin of seeds, but only 3,000 jin were available, and millet seeds were also short by 1,000 jin; There was a shortage of agricultural tools. Three horse carts needed to be replaced, and 130 pieces of grasping hooks, manure forks, iron harrows, shovels, and hoes needed to be added; Finally, it was also found that wheat seedlings had returned to green and needed to be irrigated and topdressed, and wheat field management needed to be strengthened. Based on the above investigations, "four calculations" were carried out; that is, calculating how much time and tasks were available for spring plowing, how much labor was available in the entire cooperative, and calculating the required yield of cotton and wheat based on the implementation of dense planting of cotton and field inspections of wheat plants. How to solve these difficulties that were found? At the beginning, some members wanted to rely solely on state loans. After discussion, everyone believed that in order to support the country in realizing socialist industrialization, they should learn from the veteran workers and overcome difficulties by themselves. So everyone came up with ways to pull soil to cushion pig pens and livestock pens, dig sludge and manure pile bottoms, and accumulate weeds to accumulate 800 carts of fertilizer. The shortage of agricultural tools and seeds was solved by members gathering 900 jin of scrap iron and 12 pieces of wood to organize the cooperative's blacksmiths and carpenters to rush to make agricultural tools. At the same time, 8,000 jin of cotton seeds and 1,000 jin of grain seeds were also solved by the members gathering a small amount to make a large amount. In addition, in order to prepare for drought-resistant sowing and wheat irrigation, it was also planned to dredge ditches, open ditches, and dig drainage ditches. In order to improve labor efficiency, production teams were also organized to divide production areas. By summarizing the experience and lessons of the last year's cooperative's 4,000 wasted labor days due to delays, errors, and waste, a contract system was implemented, old farmers were convened to study production technology, etc. After this series of organizational preparation work, the members had a clear understanding and confidently formulated a cotton and grain production increase plan: The entire cooperative had 581 mu of cotton fields, with an average increase of 10% on the basis of the highest yield in 1952—263 jin of seed cotton per mu. There were 547 mu of wheat fields, with an average increase of 10% on the basis of last year's 336 jin per mu. At the same time, it also signed a joint contract with the district supply and marketing cooperative to pre-sell 57,310 jin of lint and 74,890 jin of wheat to the state, and the supply and marketing cooperative supplied them with various production and living materials they needed. The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative reported these achievements and experiences to the workers of the Yubei Textile Factory in a letter and promoted them to the whole village—and later to the whole county—prominently solving the problems of fertilizer shortage and water conservancy construction in the village. When the peasants in the whole village were enthusiastically carrying out the production plan of accumulating 2,000 carts of fertilizer, repairing 25 gate mouths, and digging 3,200 zhang of channels and drainage ditches to strive for a 10% increase in cotton and grain production, the good news came from the Yubei Textile Factory that fine yarn worker Xu Xingdi increased from watching 900 spindles to 1,400 spindles, the highest record in the country. The peasants were really ecstatic. They quickly reported their spring plowing production achievements to the spinning mill workers again and said, let us encourage and compete with each other. … We now have more energy for production whenever we see the chimney of the spinning mill smoking.

    郭王度村的春耕生产运动
  　本报记者　吕建中
    河南省安阳县郭王度村是产棉区。这里，由于领导方面对农民进行政治教育与政策教育和当前的具体工作结合得好，不仅扭转了农民缩小棉田的思想，按照国家计划扩大了棉田，并且以先锋农业生产合作社为核心，把全村整个春耕生产运动推进了一步。
    这里的农民在学习总路线当中，社会主义觉悟是显著提高了。深切认识到发展工业，巩固国防的重要；并热烈盼望着早日实现农业机械化，过社会主义的幸福生活。但是，人民政府号召扩大棉田的意义，他们开始时却没有足够的理解。他们认为：
  “卖棉没有卖粮光荣。”同时还怕棉价低，怕棉花不能抵交公粮，因此，曾经打算把今年的棉田缩小三分之一以上。
    中共安阳地委驻村工作组和中共村支部采用组织农民参观豫北纱厂和工人举行联欢的活的教育方式，给农民上了深刻的一课。
      豫北纱厂的工人热情地欢迎了他们，引导他们参观了整个生产过程，举行了座谈会。工人代表向他们介绍了纱厂的生产情况，不说工人们全年的生产价值，仅去年九月至十一月该厂工人找窍门，挖潜力，克服各种困难，就给国家增产节约了二百七十八亿元。他们当场计算了一下：这笔钱，如用来支援农业生产，可买一百三十部拖拉机，或两万六千部解放式水车。
    农民看了纺纱机上铸有上海或天津某某工厂造等字样，又惊又喜。他们说：“原来咱中国也能制造这样好的机器呀！”工人又向他们解释：旧中国的纺织工业是操纵在帝国主义和官僚资本主义手里，农民种了棉花自己却穿不上衣服，新中国的纺织工业是为了适应全国人民生活的需要，现在全国人民尤其是广大农民兄弟都翻身了，对纺织品的需要量一天比一天大，纺织工业也就需要迅速发展，因此工人便想办法研究和制造出这些纺纱机来。不说全国，光豫北纱厂现在就由一九五零年一万二千锭子发展到五万锭子。郭王度全村一年所产的棉花，大约只够这一个厂子纺两天到三天。因此农民兄弟们扩大棉田，把棉花卖给国家，是十分重要和光荣的任务。
    参观的农民深深感动，因为这些情况是和他们的切身生活联系着的。正由于他们使用了工人所制出来的新式农具，改进了生产技术，全村的棉花产量才由一九四九年每亩六十斤逐渐提高到一九五二年每亩二百六十三斤，超过解放前三倍以上；也正由于国家的纺织工业发展了，布匹价格降低了，现在全村大部分青年人才能穿上新衣，去年光绒衣就买了一百多件。过去，他们总是想着工人吃好，穿好，舒适地住在楼房里，而自己却成天早起晚眠，风里雨里干活。因此对扩大棉田有点想不通，现在他们才发觉自己的思想太窄，眼光太短了。原来扩大棉田，把棉花卖给国家，正是为了实现国家工业化，使用拖拉机，早日过社会主义幸福生活的愿望。被日寇杀死了父亲的郭振玉，过去对工人有点意见，现在他感动得眼角上挂着泪花，喃喃地向工人做了检讨，回村的当晚，他一家人就在全村对工人的赞扬声中，商量了怎样扩大棉田，争取增产，怎样办好自己的农业生产合作社。
    与此同时，工作组和村支部还结合上述政治思想教育向农民宣传了粮棉比价政策和贯彻了粮食供应政策。他们回忆了几年来人民政府都规定了合理的棉粮比价。今年，按照人民政府规定的每斤八分之七吋中级细绒皮棉，在当地可换七斤半至八斤四两小米，这比去年的棉价还高一些，按他们的计算如每亩平均产八十五斤皮棉，就可换一千斤粗粮，这就说明种棉花也是有利的。同时，工作组又认真贯彻了粮食统销政策，为帮助棉农解决生产上的困难，人民政府还实行棉花预购，并规定“财政征收，贯彻棉田、粮田同等负担以及棉田以棉花抵交公粮”的政策。全村农民懂得了这些政策以后，喜形于色地表示：“种棉花国家需要，自己也有利，政府的政策正符合咱的要求，坚决扩大棉田。”农民朱怀明本来打算少种一亩棉花，参观了纱厂，又了解了政策以后，他不少种了，还动员互助组扩大了棉田，结果全村棉田不但没减少，而且扩大了六十亩，互助合作组织也大大发展起来，乡支部书记路道平领导的先锋农业生产合作社由二十六户扩大到一百四十三户。农民的生产积极性随着政治思想的提高而大大发扬起来了，这时候，如何把农民这种积极性进一步导向春耕生产的实际行动中去，并使全村的互助合作组织更加巩固起来，就成为一个中心环节了。工作组和村支部在成绩面前没有麻痹自满，他们及时地研究出一套切合实际的“四查四算”工作，发动群众对春耕生产做了充分而具体的准备。这个工作是首先由先锋农业生产合作社创造出来加以推广的。社员们讨论了工人老大哥对国家贡献那么大，生产那样有纪律，有计划，自己也应该学习他们，于是便讨论合作社的生产计划，并订出社员共同遵守的劳动纪律。可是如何保证生产计划的实现呢？由此便进一步检查社里到底存在些什么问题。结果查出了：缺肥料，棉田需要一千二百车底肥，只有七百车，还缺五百车；缺种籽，棉田需要八千斤种籽，只有三千斤，谷子种也缺一千斤；缺农具，有三辆马车要换底，还要添置抓钩、粪叉、铁钯和锨、锄等一百三十件；最后还查出麦苗已经返青，需要整畦浇水和追肥，加强麦田管理。根据以上所查出的情况，又进行了“四算”；即计算春耕共有多少时间，多少任务，全社共有多少力量，以及根据棉花实行密植，和到田间检查，计算麦棵的结果，棉花和小麦要求多少产量。查出这些困难怎么解决？开始有些社员想单纯依靠国家贷款，经过讨论，大家认为为了支援国家实现社会主义工业化，应该学习工人老大哥的坚苦精神，自己想办法克服困难。于是大家又想出了拉土垫猪圈和牲口圈，挖污泥和粪堆底子，以及积杂草等办法，积肥八百车。缺农具和种籽由各户社员集中了九百斤废铁，十二根木料，组织社内铁匠和木匠赶做农具。同时八千斤棉种和一千斤谷种也由社员集少成多地解决了。此外，为准备抗旱播种和浇麦，又计划疏渠，开沟和挖排水沟。为了提高劳动效率，并组织了生产队划分了生产区，通过总结去年社内窝工、误工、浪费四千多个劳动日的经验教训，实行了包工包产制，召集老农研究了生产技术等。经过这一系列的组织准备工作，社员们心中有了数，满怀信心地订出棉粮增产计划：全社棉田五百八十一亩，平均每亩在产量最高的一九五二年—二百六十三斤籽棉的基础上增产一成。麦田五百四十七亩，平均每亩在去年三百三十六斤的基础上增产一成。同时并和区供销合作社订立了结合合同，预卖给国家五万七千三百一十斤皮棉，和七万四千八百九十斤小麦，并由供销合作社供给他们所需要的各种生产和生活资料。先锋农业生产合作社把这些成绩和经验，一面写信向豫北纱厂的工人报告，一面向全村——后来又向全县推广，突出地解决了全村缺肥料和兴修水利的问题。当全村农民热火朝天地在进行着积肥二千车，修闸口二十五个，挖渠道和排水沟三千二百丈，争取棉粮增产一成的生产计划时，从豫北纱厂传来了细纱工许杏娣由看九百锭子提高到一千四百锭子的全国最高纪录的喜讯，农民们真是欢欣若狂了，他们连忙把自己的春耕生产成绩再次报告给纱厂工人，并说，让我们互相鼓舞和竞赛吧。……我们现在一看见纱厂的烟囱冒烟，生产就越发有劲了。
