Longyan Iron Mine Bai Shuanbao Tunneling Team Improves Working Methods
Exceeds First Half Year Tunneling Task Ahead of Schedule

(Our Dispatch) The Bai Shuanbao tunneling team of Longyan Iron Mine, on April 4th, completed the first half of the year's production plan eighty-six days ahead of schedule and exceeding the plan by 2.34 percent. Calculated by quarter, the team exceeded the tunneling task by more than 240 meters, increasing the national production value by 196.8 million yuan.

The Bai Shuanbao team demonstrated a spirit of technical innovation in their tunneling work. They learned from the advanced experience of Ma Wanshui, a national labor model from the same mine, and created the "double wedge cross-slotting method," realizing a significant reform in tunneling blasting technology. The effect of slotting after each blast has been consistently good, averaging around 1.20 meters. Previously, using the "center wedge slotting method," the slots pulled out after each blast were only around 70 centimeters because the shot holes were not deep enough. After using the new method, the slotting depth increased by about 50 centimeters compared to the past.

The Bai Shuanbao team also improved the method of controlling water inflow in the inclined shaft, solving the problem of large amounts of water in the inclined shaft affecting the tunneling progress, and eliminating the need for manual water removal. This saves six man-hours per shift. At the same time, the team improved the loading method, adopting the "segmented backloading method." While waiting for trucks, the ore face slag is turned upwards for about five meters. The time it took to load one truck of slag in the past can now load two trucks, increasing efficiency by 100 percent.

On the basis of new victories, the workers of the Bai Shuanbao team have formulated a production plan for the second half of the year, deciding to increase tunneling efficiency by another 15.7 percent, complete the entire 1954 task by the end of July, and strive to complete a year and eight months of tasks by the end of December. They also put forward specific measures to achieve the plan: (1) Regularly inspect the team's work and individual thinking in the spirit of the general line; establish a team post responsibility system to further tap potential strength. (2) Continue to promote the spirit of production innovation and further improve the "double wedge cross-slotting method"; strictly control the amount of explosives used so that state property is not damaged in the slightest. (3) Ensure the conscientious implementation of Soviet expert suggestions, try the "bundle ignition method," and ensure safe production throughout the year.

    龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进组改进工作方法
    提前超额完成上半年掘进任务
    【本报讯】龙烟铁矿白拴宝掘进组，在四月四日提前八十六天超额百分之二点三四完成了上半年的生产计划。按季计算，超过掘进任务二百四十多公尺，给国家增产价值一亿九千六百八十万元。
    白拴宝小组在掘进工作中发挥了技术革新精神。他们学习了该矿全国劳动模范马万水的先进经验，创造出“双楔形交叉掏槽法”，实现了掘进爆破技术的重要改革。每次爆破后掏出槽子的效果一直很好，平均在一点二○公尺左右。过去用“中心楔形掏槽法”，因炮眼打不深，每次爆破后拉出的槽子在七十公分左右，使用新方法后，比过去掏槽深度提高五十公分左右。
    白拴宝小组还改进了斜井涌水的控制方法，解决了斜井水大影响掘进进度的问题，并且不用人工掏水了，一个圆班可节省六个人工。同时又改进了装车方法，采用“分段倒装法”，在等车时间把礃子面的渣向上倒五公尺左右，过去装一车渣时间现在能装两车，提高效率一倍。
    白拴宝小组的工人们在新的胜利基础上，又订出了下半年度的生产计划，决定把掘进效率再提高百分之十五点七，到七月底完成一九五四年全年任务，到十二月末要争取完成一年零八个月的任务。他们并提出了实现计划的具体措施：（一）以总路线精神经常检查小组工作，检查个人思想；建立小组岗位责任制，进一步挖掘潜在力量。（二）继续发挥生产革新精神，把“双楔形交叉掏槽法”再提高一步；严格掌握火药量，使国家财产不受到丝毫损失。（三）保证认真执行苏联专家建议，试行“束把点燃法”，保证做到全年安全生产。
