    Zverev Delivers Report on the 1954 Soviet National Budget
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] According to TASS, Moscow: On April 21st, at the joint session of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, A. Zverev, Minister of Finance of the USSR, delivered a report on the 1954 Soviet National Budget.

  Zverev said: The revenue of the 1954 Soviet National Budget submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for approval is 571.8 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 562.7 billion rubles. The budget reflects the policy of peaceful economic and cultural construction pursued by the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the policy of further developing heavy industry and, on this basis, comprehensively developing agriculture and greatly increasing the production of daily necessities.

    Zverev pointed out that the majority of the 1954 Soviet National Budget expenditure is used for the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, trade and other sectors of the national economy, and for improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. The total investment in the national economy this year amounts to 326.7 billion rubles, of which 216.3 billion rubles are allocated from the state budget and 110.4 billion rubles are allocated from the funds of economic organizations. Therefore, this year's expenditure on the national economy will increase by 19.8 percent compared to the actual expenditure in 1953. Investment in heavy industry, the timber and paper industry, the construction industry, and the building materials industry has also increased. More than 14 billion rubles have been allocated for building food factories and daily necessities factories. This year, the production of consumer goods will reach the 1955 production level stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1950-1955), that is to say, the production of consumer goods will complete the five-year plan four years ahead of schedule.

    Appropriations for the development of agriculture have increased by 42.4 percent. A total of 74.4 billion rubles of state funds have been allocated from the budget and other sources for the development of agriculture.

    Zverev said: The Communist Party and the Soviet government constantly care about the continuous improvement of the people's living and cultural standards. This year, 141.3 billion rubles will be allocated for social and cultural facilities, an increase of 10 percent over last year. Among them, 67.1 billion rubles will be allocated for universal education, training of personnel, and promoting the development of science and art; 29.3 billion rubles will be used for public health and sports; and 44.9 billion rubles will be used for social insurance, pensions, and allowances for mothers with many children.

    In order to ensure the completion of the extensive housing construction plan, the state has allocated 25.5 billion rubles, which is much more than last year.

    Zverev continued: While implementing the great plan of peaceful economic and cultural construction, the Soviet state has always been concerned about national defense. The national budget stipulates that 100.3 billion rubles will be used for defense, which accounts for 17.8 percent of the total budget expenditure. These expenses fully guarantee the growth of the Soviet Union's defense capabilities, as well as the continuous improvement of the armed forces that defend the peaceful labor and national security of the Soviet people.

    Zverev concluded: The 1954 Soviet National Budget submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for approval has great national economic significance, and it will promote the completion of the tasks of communist construction. The implementation of the new budget will play an important role in implementing the plans formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for further developing the socialist economy and improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people.

    在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上
    兹维列夫作一九五四年苏联国家预算报告
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联财政部部长阿·兹维列夫二十一日在苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院联席会议上作了一九五四年苏联国家预算的报告。
  兹维列夫说：提交苏联最高苏维埃批准的一九五四年苏联国家预算的收入是五千七百一十八亿卢布，支出是五千六百二十七亿卢布。预算反映了共产党和苏联政府奉行的和平经济和文化建设的政策，进一步发展重工业并在这个基础上全面发展农业和大大增加日用品生产的政策。
    兹维列夫指出，一九五四年苏联国家预算支出大部分用于发展工业、农业、运输、贸易和国民经济其他部门，用于提高苏联人民的物质和文化水平。今年国民经济中的投资总额共计三千二百六十七亿卢布，其中二千一百六十三亿卢布由国家预算中拨付，一千一百零四亿卢布由经济组织的资金中拨付。因此，今年用于国民经济中的支出将比一九五三年的实际支出增加百分之十九点八。重工业、木材和造纸工业、建筑工业和建筑材料工业中的投资也有增加。用于建筑食品工厂和日用品工厂的经费在一百四十亿卢布以上。今年消费品的生产将达到第五个五年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）所规定的一九五五年的生产水平，也就是说，消费品的生产将在四年内提前完成五年计划。
    发展农业的拨款增加了百分之四十二点四。从预算和其他来源拨作发展农业的国家经费共计七百四十四亿卢布。
    兹维列夫说：共产党和苏联政府经常关怀人民的生活和文化水平的不断提高。今年将拨出一千四百一十三亿卢布作为社会和文化设施费，这个数目比去年增多百分之十。其中六百七十一亿卢布将拨作普及教育，训练人材，促进科学和艺术发展的经费；二百九十三亿卢布将用于公共卫生和体育事业；四百四十九亿卢布将用于社会保险、养老金和给予子女众多的母亲的津贴。
    为保证广泛的住宅建筑计划的完成，国家拨出二百五十五亿卢布的经费，这个数目比去年多得多。
    兹维列夫接着说：苏维埃国家在执行和平经济和文化建设的远大计划的同时，对于国家的防务表示了经常的关怀。国家预算规定以一千零三亿卢布用于防务，这个数目占总预算支出的百分之十七点八。这些费用充分地保证苏联的防御力量的增长，以及保卫苏联人民的和平劳动和国家安全的武装部队的精益求精的改进。
    兹维列夫最后说：提交苏联最高苏维埃批准的一九五四年苏联国家预算具有重大的国家经济意义，它将促进共产主义建设的任务的完成。新预算的执行在实行苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府拟订的进一步发展社会主义经济和提高苏联人民物质和文化水平的计划方面将起重要的作用。
