    Liaoxi Province paid attention to transforming backward villages in its basic-level election work, laying a good foundation for the balanced development of various tasks in the future.
    Before the basic-level elections, there were quite a few backward villages in Liaoxi Province. In these villages, the policies of the Party and the government could not be well implemented, and work tasks were often not completed, which was the main reason for the unbalanced development of various tasks. These backward villages basically fell into three categories: the first type was caused by historical reasons, resulting in disunity within the village; the second type was that village cadres were irresponsible, or engaged in coercion, commandism, and illegal and undisciplined behavior; and the third type was that the village government was impure in individual cases. The general election work teams sent to these villages adopted different measures according to different situations. For the first type of village, the work team used the method of comparing the new and old societies and class education to raise the awareness of the masses. For example, in Lan Ni Pao Village, Heishan County, during the rule of the reactionary government, two villages were divided because two warlord commanders each dominated one side, sowing discord and creating antagonism. After liberation, there was still estrangement between the masses, affecting the development of various tasks. After the work team's education, the farmers realized that they should get along like brothers, and it was wrong to have disputes in the past. After the two villages reconciled, they changed the village name to "Unity Village" and elected a village people's government supported by everyone. For the second and third types of villages, the work team went deep into the masses, developed democracy in a guided and full way, criticized and educated cadres with problems, and replaced those who had serious problems and refused to correct them or whose class composition was impure, and elected people who could be active and responsible and closely connected with the masses as cadres.
    After the transformation of these backward villages, various tasks have made significant progress, catching up with advanced or general villages. After the masses of Lan Ni Pao Village, Heishan County, elected their representatives, they united around the newly elected people's government and actively responded to the government's call, reversing the backward situation of the work. The whole village overfulfilled the task of selling more than 130,000 catties of surplus grain to the state within a few days. In Niujia Village, Jinxi County, in the past, because the cadres used coercion, commandism, and were divorced from the masses, mutual aid and cooperation organizations became a mere formality. For several years, there had not been a single fixed mutual aid group in the village. Now the cadres' work style has changed. On the one hand, they actively publicized the general line, and on the other hand, they took the lead in joining groups. Half of the farmers in the village have organized ten mutual aid groups under the voluntary principle. After the general election, the work of most of the backward villages in the province has improved. Now, each county is combining the current work to conduct socialist ideological education for the cadres of these villages, teach them work methods, and improve the working system of the People's Congress and the government committee in order to consolidate the achievements of the general election.

    辽西省在基层选举中大力改造落后村
    辽西省在基层选举工作中注意改造落后村，给今后各项工作的平衡发展打下了良好基础。
    在基层选举以前，辽西省有相当一部分落后村。在这些村里，党和政府的政策不能很好地贯彻，工作任务经常不能完成，这是各项工作不能平衡发展的主要原因。这些落后村基本上有三种类型：第一种是历史上的原因，造成村内不团结；第二种是村干部不负责任，或者有强迫命令和违法乱纪行为；第三种是个别的村政权不纯。派到这些村去的普选工作组针对不同情况采取了不同的措施。对第一种类型村，工作组用新旧社会对比和阶级教育的方法，提高了群众的觉悟。如黑山县蓝泥泡村有两个屯在反动政权统治时期，因两个军阀团长各霸一方，挑拨离间，造成对立。解放后群众间仍有隔阂，影响各种工作的开展。经过工作组教育后，农民们都认识到应该像兄弟一样相处，过去闹纠纷太不对了。两屯和好以后把村名改成了“团结村”，还选出了大家拥护的村人民政府。对第二、三种类型村，工作组就深入群众，有领导地充分发扬民主，对有毛病的干部进行批评教育，对毛病严重又不改正或阶级成份不纯的分子予以撤换，选出能积极负责、密切联系群众的人当干部。
    这些落后村经过改造以后，各种工作有了显著的进步，赶上了先进村或一般村。黑山县蓝泥泡村群众普选以后团结在新选出的人民政府的周围，积极响应政府号召，扭转了工作落后的局面。全村几天内就超额地向国家出售了十三万斤余粮。锦西县牛家店村过去因为干部强迫命令和脱离群众，互助合作组织成为形式，几年来村内没有一个定型的互助组；现在干部作风转变了，一面积极宣传总路线，一面带头入组，全村半数农户已在自愿原则下组织了十个互助组。经过普选后，全省绝大部分落后村的工作都提高了一步。现在各县正结合当前工作对这些村的干部进行社会主义的思想教育，并教给他们工作方法，健全人民代表大会和政府委员会工作制度，以巩固普选的成果。　（新华社）
