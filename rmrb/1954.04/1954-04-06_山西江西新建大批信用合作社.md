    Shanxi Province has recently established a large number of new credit cooperatives. From the time when various regions launched the "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" work last year, to the end of February this year, a total of 957 new credit cooperatives were established in the province; at this time, there were a total of 2,533 credit cooperatives in the province, an average of one in every two and a half townships. The credit cooperatives have more than 1,634,000 members, and the total share capital and deposits amount to 82.64 billion yuan.
    In the process of developing credit cooperatives, Shanxi generally implemented the policy of "active leadership, steady progress," and conducted serious socialist education for farmers, and then established cooperatives on the basis of mass voluntary participation. When Dongyi and Shenquan townships in Lucheng County established credit cooperatives, township cadres used the facts of farmers such as Ren Huze being exploited by usurious loans to carry out propaganda and education. Many farmers said: Usury is still so rampant! Only by establishing credit cooperatives can we more effectively combat usurers and embark on the road to prosperity for everyone. Within five days, farmers in these two townships invested 1,100 shares in the credit cooperative, with a total share capital of 33 million yuan.
    In order to establish and enhance the prestige of credit cooperatives, most areas of Shanxi adopted the method of "collecting shares, deposits, and loans simultaneously" when establishing credit cooperatives. After collecting a portion of share capital and deposits, thirty-five newly established credit cooperatives in Zhao City and Quwo County, such as Donghan and Gengyu, immediately issued more than 210 million yuan in loans, helping many farmers solve difficulties in production, life, and other aspects, and thus quickly gained the trust of the farmers. The number of people who invested in shares increased a lot, and many people actively deposited money in the credit cooperatives after investing in shares. Within a short period, these thirty-five newly established credit cooperatives absorbed more than 889 million yuan in share capital and more than 500 million yuan in deposits.

    Credit cooperative organizations in Jiangxi Province have recently experienced further development. Since the launch of the general line propaganda, more than 1,000 credit cooperatives have been newly established and are being prepared for establishment throughout the province, and there are more than 270 credit mutual aid groups. Together with the original credit cooperative organizations, there are more than 2,500 credit cooperatives and more than 1,800 credit mutual aid groups in the province (some of which have been or are being converted into credit cooperatives). More than a quarter of the townships in the province have established credit cooperative organizations. Many of the original credit cooperatives in various places have also undergone new developments. Seventeen credit cooperatives in the Ninth District of Leping County increased their membership by 4,296 new members, and expanded their share capital by 100.889 million yuan. Some credit cooperatives that were not well-managed in the past have undergone rectification, and their business operations have also undergone great changes. In the past, some cadres of credit cooperatives in Wan'an County emphasized "safe lending, quick recovery, and high-interest profits" in business operations, and loaned money to merchants in market towns, which promoted commercial speculation. Recently, they criticized capitalist business ideology, established the correct viewpoint of serving members and production, and restored the reputation of these cooperatives among farmers. According to statistics, throughout the province, around the time when the planned grain purchase began, there were 241 credit cooperatives with many problems and a poor foundation. After rectification, the business of these credit cooperatives has developed.
    Most county and district committees of the Chinese Communist Party and People's Governments in Jiangxi Province specifically arranged the task of developing credit cooperative organizations when arranging the planned grain purchase work and agricultural production. Counties such as Fenyi also trained cadres to establish credit cooperatives. After the basic completion of the unified grain purchase work, 55 counties throughout the province transferred more than 2,400 full-time cadres from existing and newly established credit cooperatives, and conducted education on the general line and how to run credit cooperatives through short-term training classes or representative conferences, and exchanged experiences. In this way, a good foundation was laid for consolidating new cooperatives and improving old cooperatives.

### 山西江西新建大批信用合作社

    山西江西新建大批信用合作社
    山西省最近新建立了大批信用合作社。从去年各地开展“优待售粮储蓄”工作时起，到今年二月底，全省共新建信用合作社九百五十七个；这时全省共有二千五百三十三个信用合作社，平均两个半乡有一个。信用合作社社员达一百六十三万四千多人，股金和存款共有八百二十六亿四千多万元。
    在发展信用合作社的过程中，山西各地一般都贯彻了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，向农民认真进行了社会主义教育，然后在群众自觉自愿的基础上建社。潞城县东邑、神泉两乡建立信用合作社时，乡干部用农民任虎则等受高利贷剥削的事实进行宣传教育。许多农民说：高利贷还这样横行！只有建立起信用合作社，才能更有力地打击高利贷者，走大家富裕的道路。在五天内，这两个乡的农民就在信用合作社入了一千一百股，股金共三千三百万元。
    为了树立和提高信用合作社的威信，山西大部地区在建立信用合作社时，采用了“边集股，边存款，边发放”的办法。赵城和曲沃两县的东韩、耿峪等三十五个新建的信用合作社收集了一部分股金和存款以后，马上发放出二亿一千多万元的贷款，帮助不少农民解决了生产、生活等方面的困难，因而很快取得了农民的信任。入股的人增加很多，许多人入股以后还积极向信用合作社存款。这三十五个新建的信用合作社在不长的期间内，即吸收股金八亿八千九百多万元，收储存款五亿多万元。

    江西省信用合作组织最近有了进一步的发展。从开展总路线宣传以来，全省各地新建立和正在筹备建立的信用合作社已有一千多个，信用互助组有二百七十多个。连同原有的信用合作组织，全省共有信用合作社二千五百多个，信用互助组一千八百多个（其中有一部分已经或正在转为信用合作社）。全省四分之一以上的乡已建立信用合作组织。各地不少原有的信用合作社也有了新的发展。乐平县第九区十七个信用合作社就增加了四千二百九十六个新社员，扩大股金一亿零八百八十九万元。过去有些没有办好的信用合作社，经过整顿，业务上也有了很大转变。万安县有些信用合作社的干部过去在业务经营方面，强调“放得稳、收得快、多赚利息”，曾贷款给集镇商人，助长了商业投机。最近他们批判了资本主义经营思想，树立了为社员、为生产服务的正确观点，挽回了这些社在农民中的信誉。据统计，全省在粮食计划收购开始前后，有二百四十一个信用合作社问题多、基础差，经过整顿以后，这些信用合作社的业务都有开展。
    江西省多数县、区的中共党委和人民政府在布置粮食计划收购工作和农业生产的时候，就具体布置了发展信用合作组织的任务。分宜等县还集训了建立信用合作社的干部。粮食统购工作基本结束以后，全省有五十五个县分别调集原有和新建的信用合作社的专职干部二千四百多人，通过举办短期训练班或召开代表会的办法，进行了关于总路线和如何办信用合作社的教育，并交流了经验。这样，就为巩固新社和提高老社打下了很好的基础。
