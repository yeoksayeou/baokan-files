Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 11th: The Indian "Blitz" weekly's Bangkok correspondent reports: In early 1954, representatives of the puppet governments of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos held talks in Bangkok on establishing a so-called "Buddhist Nations League." The purpose of these talks was said to be to ensure the "independence" of the three countries. The talks were held in strict secrecy. According to sources close to the Thai Prime Minister, the American envoys to Thailand directly participated in and guided the aforementioned talks. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, and the head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Thailand, Gilmore, led the talks between the Laotian puppet group delegation and the Thai government. According to American suggestions, some preliminary obligations aimed at establishing the "Buddhist Nations League" have now been agreed upon. The Bangkok talks deemed it appropriate for Cambodia to participate in the aforementioned alliance. The American representatives also guaranteed to promote its realization. The "Blitz" weekly correspondent said that recently, U.S. Ambassador to Indochina, Heath, and the head of the U.S. Foreign Aid Administration to Indochina, McReynolds, have been active in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in order to complete the preparatory basis for negotiations on establishing the "Buddhist Nations League."
