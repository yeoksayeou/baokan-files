    今年西南区的新茶，已在三月上、中旬陆续上市，各地国营茶业公司已及时展开收购工作。云南省顺宁县在三月八日就开始收购新茶，四川、贵州两省在三月二十日前后开始收购。四川、云南、贵州三省的茶业公司已和供销合作社签订了代购合同。今年西南区计划收购茶叶的数量，将比去年实际收购数量增加百分之二十二点六三。
    为了扶植茶农生产和大量收购茶叶，满足消费者的需要，中国茶业公司西南区公司将今年全区茶叶收购价格平均较去年合理地提高了百分之十四点九二，比一九五一年就提高百分之三十七点一六。为了保证完成国家收购茶叶的计划，云南、四川等省人民政府商业厅和茶业公司已组织工作组分别到缅宁、普洱、邛崃、宜宾等地协助开展收购工作。西南区行政委员会对外贸易局和中国茶业公司、中国茶业公司西南区公司，也抽派干部到各省协助收购。
