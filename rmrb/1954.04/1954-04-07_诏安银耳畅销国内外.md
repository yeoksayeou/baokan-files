    Zhao'an White Fungus Sells Well Domestically and Abroad
    The white fungus (also known as silver ear fungus) produced in Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, which has excellent medicinal efficacy and nutritional value, is estimated to produce 48,000 taels this year. The quality of Zhao'an County's white fungus is very good, but it was long buried before liberation. After liberation, the People's Government carefully studied the quality of Zhao'an County's white fungus, proving that it contains abundant carbohydrates, proteins and other nutrients just like Sichuan white fungus. It has high value in medicine, can nourish the lungs, replenish blood, and aid digestion, especially for gynecological diseases, such as leucorrhea and metrorrhagia, which have unique effects. After being introduced at the 1953 National Native Products Conference, this white fungus not only has a good market at home, but also is sold far abroad.
    The Zhao'an County People's Government has successively provided loans of several tens of millions of yuan to help people in mountainous areas solve the difficulties in cultivating white fungus, and the supply and marketing cooperatives also actively purchase it at reasonable prices. In 1952, the total output of white fungus in Zhao'an County was only 4,500 taels, in 1953 it increased to 6,500 taels, and this year's output will be more than six times higher than last year.

    诏安银耳畅销国内外
    具有很好的医药效能和滋补价值的福建省诏安县出产的银耳（即白木耳），今年估计可产四万八千两。诏安县的银耳质量很好，但在解放前却被长期埋没。解放后，人民政府认真研究了诏安县银耳的品质，证明它和四川银耳一样含有丰富的醣、蛋白质等养分，在医药上有很高的价值，可以养肺、补血和帮助消化，尤其是对妇科病，如白带、血崩等有独特的功效。经过一九五三年全国土特产会议介绍后，这种银耳不但在国内有了很好的销路，有一部分还远销到国外。
    诏安县人民政府曾先后贷款数千万元帮助山区人民解决培植银耳的困难，供销合作社也以合理价格积极进行收购。一九五二年诏安全县银耳总产量仅四千五百两，一九五三年提高到六千五百两，今年的产量又将比去年提高六倍多。
