    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 26th: The Pyongyang newspapers published on the 25th the decree issued on the 23rd by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the Three-Year Plan for the Rehabilitation and Development of the People's Economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 1954 to 1956.

    The decree first outlines a series of democratic reforms regarding the people's economy undertaken by the people's government in the northern part of Korea shortly after the "August 15th" liberation, and the great achievements made in the subsequent five years. For example, by 1950, the production of a series of industrial products had reached and exceeded the level of 1944; in 1948, the harvest of major grains, especially rice, had exceeded the level of 1944.

    The decree points out that the peaceful labor of the Korean people was disrupted by the armed invasion of the Republic's northern half by the American aggressors and their running dog, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang. This war brought incalculable disasters to the Korean people. However, the war did not frustrate the heroic will of the peace-loving and freedom-loving Korean people.

    The decree states: The Korean people, who have achieved a historic victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, have launched a peaceful construction to restore the people's economy destroyed by the war. The Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies continue to provide selfless and enormous assistance for the restoration of our Republic's people's economy.

    The decree, after pointing out that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has all the conditions to successfully restore the people's economy in the next three years, believes that the three-year plan to restore the people's economy destroyed by the war and restore industrial and agricultural production to pre-war levels and exceed pre-war levels in the next three years is timely and appropriate.

    The decree stipulates that in order to complete the basic tasks of the three-year plan, industrial production must be rapidly developed. By 1956, industrial production should exceed the level of 1949 before the war, with the total industrial output reaching approximately 1.5 times, and the production of consumer goods reaching approximately twice. In the development of various industrial sectors and enterprises, the remnants of colonial bias caused by Japanese imperialism must be eradicated to lay the foundation for our country's future industrialization. The decree also points out that the Republic's defense capabilities should be further strengthened in the future.

    The decree points out the basic tasks of restoring and developing the rural economy, transportation, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, gradually improving people's lives, vigorously improving labor productivity, reducing production costs, and implementing economic accounting systems. The decree also points out that economic ties with the Soviet Union, China, and other countries should be continuously expanded and strengthened, and the volume of trade with these countries should continue to be increased.

    The decree emphasizes that, based on the above-mentioned tasks, the Supreme People's Assembly has decided as follows: To approve the Three-Year Plan for the Rehabilitation and Development of the People's Economy from 1954 to 1956, which was prepared and formulated by the State Planning Commission and approved by the Cabinet.

    The decree, after detailing the specific tasks of each sector of the people's economy and each region of northern Korea in the three-year plan, points out that the three-year plan requires us to mobilize all domestic forces. In order to complete the three-year plan, the state needs to invest approximately 79 billion yuan in the construction of the people's economy and culture and welfare facilities. The decree emphasizes that the decisive condition for the successful completion of the arduous task of the three-year plan is to maximize the use of domestic resources, increase production and improve labor productivity, and constantly practice economy.

    The decree also points out that the implementation of the three-year plan is a national undertaking. All levels of government, political parties, and social organizations must mobilize the working masses to complete and overfulfill the three-year plan for the rehabilitation and development of the people's economy.

    【新华社平壤二十六日电】平壤报纸二十五日刊载了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会在二十三日发布的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一九五四年到一九五六年人民经济恢复发展的三年计划的法令。
    法令首先概述了在“八·一五”解放后不久朝鲜北部的人民政权所采取关于人民经济的一系列民主改革，及其后五年中所取得的巨大成就。例如：到一九五零年，已有一系列的工业品的产量达到并超过了一九四四年的水平；在一九四八年，主要谷物特别是稻子的收获量已超过了一九四四年的水平。
    法令指出：朝鲜人民的和平劳动被美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮对共和国北半部的武装进犯所破坏了。这个战争给朝鲜人民带来了不可估量的灾害。但是，战争并没有挫折热爱和平与自由的朝鲜人民的英勇意志。
    法令说：在祖国解放战争中取得了历史性胜利的朝鲜人民，已展开了恢复被战争破坏的人民经济的和平建设。苏联、中国和各人民民主国家为我们共和国的人民经济的恢复，继续不断地给予无私的巨大援助。
    法令在指出朝鲜民主主义人民共和国能够在最近三年期间胜利地恢复人民经济的一切条件后，认为：通过规定在最近三年期间恢复被战争破坏的人民经济、把工业和农业生产恢复到战前水平和超过战前水平的三年计划，是适合时宜和适当的。
    法令规定：为了完成三年计划的基本任务，要迅速地发展工业生产。到一九五六年，工业生产要超过战前一九四九年的水平，工业总产量约达到一点五倍，人民的消费品生产约达到二倍。在各工业部门和企业的发展中，要根除日本帝国主义所造成的殖民地偏颇性的残余，奠定我国将来工业化的基础。法令并指出：今后要进一步加强共和国的国防力量。
    法令指出了恢复和发展农村经济、交通运输业、商业、文化教育事业，逐步改善人民生活，大力提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本、贯彻经济核算制等基本任务。法令并指出：要不断地扩大和加强与苏联、中国和其它国家的经济联系，继续增加和这些国家的贸易额。
    法令着重说：根据上述任务，最高人民会议决定如下：批准由国家计划委员会所准备和制订的、业经内阁通过的一九五四年到一九五六年人民经济恢复发展的三年计划。
    法令在详细地规定了在三年计划中人民经济各部门和朝鲜北部各地区的具体任务之后指出：三年计划要求我们动员国内的一切力量。为了完成三年计划，需要国家对人民经济和文化、福利设施的建设投资约七百九十亿元。法令强调指出：胜利完成三年计划的艰巨任务的决定条件，是要最大限度地利用国内的内部资源、增加生产和提高劳动生产率，以及经常地实行节约。
    法令又指出：实行三年计划是全民性的事业。各级机关、政党、社会团体要动员劳动群众完成和超额完成人民经济恢复发展的三年计划。
