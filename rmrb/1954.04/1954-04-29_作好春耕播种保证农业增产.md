    Wu'an County Overfulfills Cotton Planting Plan
    Wu'an County, Hebei Province, has overfulfilled its cotton planting plan for this year.
    After the rain in mid-April, farmers in various parts of Wu'an County worked intensely to seize the moisture and plant. As of the 20th, the county had sown more than 496,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the annual plan by more than 14,000 mu.
    The main reason Wu'an County was able to overfulfill the state's cotton planting plan this year is that the leadership recognized the importance of further increasing cotton production and concentrated its efforts on organization and leadership. Before the rain, 155 county-level government cadres were organized, led by members of the county party committee, to go to various districts to guide the masses in seizing the moisture for planting. After the county's rainfall, another 123 cadres were transferred from county-level government to form working groups to go to various districts to assist in the work. At the same time, old farmers' technical symposiums were held at the village level to exchange cotton planting experiences. Assistance was also given to mutual aid and cooperation organizations in carrying out cotton planting work, so as to drive the vast number of farmers. For example, the Zheng Wenxue Agricultural Cooperative in Beian Village divided the work according to the specialties of each member and carried out a blitz, and the entire cooperative planted 206 mu of cotton in four days. Under its influence, many individual farmers actively organized temporary mutual assistance and worked from dawn till dusk to plant in a concentrated effort. Many groups and cooperatives not only completed their own planting plans, but also divided the work to help the widowed, orphaned, and childless, as well as military families and their dependents, who lacked labor and livestock, to plant on time. In addition, the supply of cotton seeds and grain was done well to meet the needs of the masses. Difficult households were allowed to purchase on credit so that they could plant in time to avoid delaying the agricultural season. All grain supply points implemented a rotating shift system so that the masses could purchase grain in the morning and evening.
    East China Region Fully Launches Spring Planting
    Spring planting is in full swing throughout East China. The spring cultivation and plowing of dry land areas in northern Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces has ended, and the sowing of sorghum and corn is also nearing completion. Cotton sowing is being carried out intensely, and 50% of the cotton fields in Heze Prefecture, Shandong Province, have been sown. Peanuts, sweet potatoes, millet, and other crops will also be sown successively in various places. The sowing and transplanting of rice in the southern rice-growing areas will enter a busy stage. The sowing of more than 6.2 million mu of early rice in Fujian Province has basically ended, and the soaking of seeds for middle and late rice has been carried out universally, and sowing will be completed by the end of April. Double-cropping early rice in Longxi, Jinjiang, and other places began transplanting during "Qingming," and the first mid-cultivation has been carried out in a few areas. Early rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has also begun sowing. The sowing of early rice on both sides of the Oujiang and Aojiang rivers in Zhejiang Province was completed around Qingming, and many rice seedling fields in Pingyang County have become a stretch of oil green. Various places along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are also actively sowing. Huizhou Prefecture is organizing rice seedling fields in preparation for sowing.
    In the spring planting work, all localities have generally paid attention to building water conservancy projects and increasing fertilizer accumulation. As of early April, Anhui Province had built more than 192,000 large and small farmland water conservancy projects, completing 109% of the spring repair plan. The water conservancy projects currently completed in Fujian Province can benefit more than 2.81 million mu of farmland. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, this year increased by 40% compared with the same period last year, and the entire province of Fujian also increased by more than 10% compared with the same period last year. All localities have paid special attention to promoting improved varieties. Fujian Province has promoted 367,000 jin of eight improved rice varieties, such as "Nante No." Shandong Province expects that the selection of improved varieties this year can increase grain production by more than 500 million jin and ginned cotton by more than 8 million jin.
    Southwest Region Overcomes Drought to Plant Rice
    More than 70% of the areas in the Southwest Region have completed the rice sowing work. Sichuan Province has completed 90%, and some high mountain areas in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces are also preparing for sowing or have begun sowing; some districts and townships in Simao and Jinping in Yunnan Province and Fushun in southern Sichuan have begun transplanting rice seedlings. Generally, the sowing of early corn has been completed. Most cotton-producing areas in Yunnan Province have completed the cotton sowing work; Jianyang and Suining in Sichuan Province will also begin in the next few days. Sweet potato seedling cultivation is underway in various places. Seedlings are generally growing well in areas where sowing has been completed. In Renhuai County, Guizhou Province, 90% of the millet sown in the north has sprouted; corn in Wangmo, Ceheng, and other places has grown into tender seedlings two or three inches high.
    This year, farmers in many areas have made early preparations for spring plowing, and the sowing time has been advanced compared with previous years. Although various places encountered varying degrees of drought at the beginning of spring plowing, under the specific leadership of party and government leading organs at all levels and the close cooperation of banks, cooperatives, and other relevant departments, farmers in various places vigorously carried out drought prevention and drought resistance, water storage and water conservation work. Now, except for Yunnan Province, which still has signs of drought, other places have basically overcome the drought and can complete the scheduled sowing plan.
    More than 300 state-owned farms and more than 500 agricultural technology promotion stations in the entire region have also greatly strengthened the demonstration and promotion of agricultural technology. Many farms and technology promotion stations have signed technical cooperation contracts with nearby agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and have sent cadres to the cooperatives and groups to help farmers improve their farming methods with new technologies. This year, advanced experiences such as mud and water selection of rice, sparse sowing of rice seeds, cultivation of strong seedlings, and new-style rice seedling fields have not only been widely promoted in Sichuan Province, but also farmers in most areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces have begun to adopt them. Yi farmers in Liangshan area and Miao farmers in Kaili have also gradually improved their farming techniques.
    Mobilize Farmers to Complete Sowing Tasks on Schedule
    This month, there was widespread rainfall in Shanxi Province and most areas of Henan Province, and the drought has basically been relieved. After the rain, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government immediately issued an emergency notice to all prefectures and counties, requiring all localities, especially Jinan area, to seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses to take advantage of the moisture to sow cotton, and areas that have not yet been sown should promptly mobilize farmers to shallowly cultivate, harrow, and do a good job in drought prevention and resistance. Leading organs at all levels in Henan Province also immediately took emergency measures after the rain. The Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties to temporarily stop other work and fully lead farmers to seize the moisture for planting. After receiving instructions from higher authorities, the Anyang County People's Government convened a meeting of cadres directly under the county to organize more than 200 people to go to the countryside. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also held an emergency meeting, requiring all localities to mobilize farmers to complete the sowing tasks on time and ensure good planting.

    Shanghai Farm Improves Cotton Field Cultivation Techniques
    The state-owned Shanghai Farm in Jiangsu Province was established in 1950, and all the cultivated land is newly reclaimed wasteland. 60% of the 61,000 mu of cotton fields sown last year were raw wasteland, containing more salt, and the soil moisture conservation was not done well enough. Nearly 10,000 mu of cotton seedlings emerged unevenly or did not emerge at all. This year, the farm learned from this lesson and first did a good job of soil improvement and soil moisture conservation during sowing, and carried out deep plowing;
  Organic compost and manure were used as base fertilizer, and 120,000 dan of grass were covered. Cotton seeds were selected and germination rates were tested. Therefore, germination is good. At the same time, organizational mobilization, labor allocation, and repair of agricultural implements were also carried out. At present, all the personnel in the farm are enthusiastically involved in the sowing campaign, and are working hard to complete the production task of 10 million jin of seed cotton.

    Lutai and Other Farms Advance Sowing of Late Spring Crops
    According to last year's bumper harvest experience, state-owned Lutai, Wulidian, Hangu, Qinghe, and other mechanical farms have all advanced the sowing period of late spring crops this year. Lutai Farm has started direct dry seeding of rice on April 15 and will complete sowing recently and start irrigation. Qinghe and Hangu farms will start sowing rice around the 20th, and the irrigation date will also be advanced to allow the rice seeds to germinate earlier. All farms have appropriately increased the amount of sowing and improved sowing techniques to create conditions for rice seedling protection and early maturity.
    Cotton at the Wulidian Farm was sown in mid-April, 6 or 7 days earlier than last year. The cotton fields in the farm are well leveled, and the sowing techniques have also been improved, correcting the shortcomings of the past where sowing was too deep, affecting emergence and seedling protection.
    The frost-free period in the areas where the above-mentioned farms are located is short, and the early frost period varies greatly. Appropriate early sowing of late spring crops has a great effect on promoting early maturity and improving quality.  (Li Chungui)
    Increasingly Mechanized Xinjiang Reclamation Area
    The sowing of 227,700 mu of spring wheat and the spring cultivation of 213,300 mu of winter wheat in the reclamation areas of Xinjiang have ended, and the reclamation areas are now continuing to grab the planting of flax, peas, and qingke and other early spring crops. The area of mechanized cultivation in the reclamation areas has expanded from more than 123,000 mu last year to more than 297,000 mu. In addition to the five mechanized farms that have been established, a total of 15 mechanized cultivation areas have been planned this year, and a mechanized cultivation team has been established in each mechanized cultivation area. A total of more than 150 large and small tractors of various types were dispatched during the spring plowing. Due to the use of a large number of machines and new-style animal-drawn agricultural implements for cultivation, and the improved cultivation level of technical personnel, the spring plowing and sowing work this year was able to proceed smoothly.

    作好春耕播种保证农业增产
    武安县超额完成植棉计划
    河北省武安县超额完成了今年的植棉计划。
    四月中旬落雨后，武安县各地农民便紧张地进行了抢墒播种。截至二十日止，全县已播种棉花四十九万六千多亩，超过年计划一万四千多亩。
    武安县今年能够超额完成国家植棉的计划，主要是由于领导方面认识到进一步提高棉花产量的重要性，集中全力进行了组织领导。落雨前，曾组织县级机关干部一百五十五名，由县委委员带领分赴各区，领导群众抢墒播种。全县降雨后，又从县级机关抽调一百二十三名干部组成工作组分赴各区帮助工作。同时，还以村为单位召开老农技术座谈会，交流了植棉经验。又帮助互助合作组织搞好棉花播种工作，以带动广大农民。如北安庄郑文学农业社由于按每个社员的特长分工，并进行突击，全社在四天内播完了二百零六亩棉花。在它的影响下，许多单干农民积极组织临时互助，起早贪黑突击播种。很多组、社不仅完成了自己种植计划，还分工帮助缺乏劳动力和畜力的孤寡以及单干户和烈、军属按时播种。此外，做好棉籽、粮食供应工作，以满足群众的需要。并对困难户实行赊购，使其及时播种，以免贻误农时。各粮食供应点都实行了轮流值班制度，使群众能利用早晨和晚间购粮。
    华东区全面展开春耕播种
    华东各地全面展开春耕播种工作。山东、安徽、江苏等省北部旱田地区春耕春耙业已结束，高粱、玉米的播种工作也接近完成。棉花播种正在紧张进行，山东省菏泽专区百分之五十的棉田已播了种。花生、地瓜、谷子等作物，各地亦将陆续开始播种。南部水稻地区的播种插秧工作，将进入大忙阶段。福建省六百二十多万亩早稻播种工作已基本结束，中、晚稻已普遍进行浸种，四月底即可播种完毕。龙溪、晋江等地双季早稻在“清明”开始插秧，少数地区已进行第一次中耕。江苏、浙江两省的早稻也已开始播种，浙江省瓯江和鳌江两岸早稻播种已在清明前后完成，平阳县许多秧田已成一片油绿。安徽省沿江各地亦在积极播种，徽州专区正在整理秧田，准备播种。
    在春耕播种工作中，各地普遍注意兴修水利，增积肥料。到四月上旬止，安徽省已修筑大小农田水利工程十九万二千余处，完成春修计划百分之一百零九。福建省目前完成的水利工程，可使二百八十一万余亩农田受益。安徽省阜阳专区今年积肥量比去年同期增加百分之四十，福建全省也比去年同期增加一成多。各地特别注意推广优良品种，福建省因地制宜推广了“南特号”等八种水稻良种三十六万七千多斤。山东全省预计今年选用良种可增产粮食五亿多斤，皮棉八百多万斤。
    西南区战胜干旱播种水稻
    西南区百分之七十以上的地区已经结束水稻播种工作。四川省已完成百分之九十，云南、贵州、西康三省部分高山地区也正在进行播种准备或已开始播种；云南省思茅、金屏一带和川南富顺等县部分区乡已开始栽秧。一般地区早玉米已全部播种完毕。云南省大部分产棉区已经完成棉花播种工作；四川省简阳、遂宁等地日内也将开始。红苕育苗工作各地正在进行。已完成播种地区，秧苗一般生长情况良好。贵州省仁怀县北部播种的谷子，百分之九十已经出芽；望谟、册亨等地的玉米已经长出两三寸高的嫩苗。
    今年，不少地区的农民及早做好了春耕准备工作，播种时间较往年提前。虽然春耕一开始各地就遇到程度不同的干旱，但在各级党政领导机关的具体领导和银行、合作等有关部门的密切配合下，各地农民大力开展防旱抗旱、蓄水保水工作，现在除云南省仍有旱象外，其他各地已基本上战胜了干旱，可以完成预定的播种计划。
    全区三百多个国营农场和五百多个农业技术推广站也大大加强了农业技术的示范推广工作。许多农场和技术推广站都和附近的农业生产合作社及互助组签订了技术结合合同，并派出干部深入社、组，以新的技术帮助农民改进耕作方法。今年，水稻的泥水选种、稀撒谷种、培育壮苗、新式秧田等先进经验，不仅在四川省普遍推广，云南、贵州、西康三省大部地区的农民也开始采用。凉山地区的彝族农民和凯里的苗族农民也逐步改进了耕作技术。
    动员农民按期完成播种任务
    山西全省和河南省大部地区本月中旬普遍降雨，旱象基本上已解除。山西省人民政府雨后即向各专区、各县发出紧急通知，要求各地特别是晋南地区，抓紧时机发动群众趁墒抢墒播种棉花，尚未播种的地区要及时发动农民浅耕耙耱，做好防旱抗旱工作。河南省各级领导机关在雨后也立即采取了紧急措施。安阳专署已指示各县暂时停止其他工作，全力领导农民趁墒抢种。安阳县人民政府接到上级的指示后，召开了县直属机关干部会议，组织二百多人下乡。新乡专区也召开了紧急会议，要求各地动员农民按时完成播种任务，并保证种好。

    上海农场改进棉田耕作技术
    江苏省国营上海农场是在一九五○年建立的，所有耕地都是新开垦的荒地。去年播种的六万一千亩棉田中有百分之六十是生荒，含有较多的盐分，加上保墒工作做得不够好，播种后将近一万亩地的棉苗出的不齐或未出。今年农场吸取了这一教训，播种时首先做好土壤改良与保墒工作，进行了深耕；
  用有机物堆厩肥做基肥，并盖了十二万担的草。棉种都经过选择，又试验了发芽率。因此，发芽情况
  良好。同时，也进行了组织动员、分配劳动力、检修农具等各项准备工作。目前，全场人员正热烈地投入播种运动，为完成一千万斤籽棉生产任务而努力。  （郑龙倪俊杰王建寅）
    芦台等农场提早播种晚春作物
    国营芦台、五里店、汉沽、清河等机械农场，根据去年的丰收经验，今年都提早了晚春作物的播种期。芦台农场已在四月十五日开始水稻旱直播，最近即可播完，并开始灌水。清河、汉沽两农场的水稻在二十日左右开始播种，灌水日期也将提早，使稻种早日发芽。各场都适当增加了播种量，并改进播种技术，为水稻保苗和提早成熟创造条件。
    五里店农场的棉花已在四月中旬播种完毕，比去年提早了六、七天。该场棉田都整理得很平坦，播种技术也有改进，纠正了过去播种过深影响出苗保苗的缺点。
    上述几个农场的所在地区无霜期较短，早霜期变化较大，晚春作物的适当提早播种，对促使早熟和提高质量有很大作用。  （李春桂）
    日益机械化的新疆垦区
    新疆各垦区的二十二万七千余亩春麦的播种及二十一万三千余亩冬麦的春耙工作已结束，现正继续抢播胡麻、豌豆、青稞等早春作物。各垦区的机耕面积，已从去年的十二万三千余亩扩大到二十九万七千余亩。除已经建立起来的五个机耕农场外，今年共又规划了十五个机耕区，每一个机耕区均成  立了机耕队。在春耕中共出动各种类型的大小拖拉
  机一百五十余台。由于使用了大批的机器及新式的马拉农机具进行耕作，技术人员提高了耕作水平，使今年的春耕播种工作能够顺利地进行。
