    Spring Afforestation Work Achieves Great Success
    [Our Newspaper] The spring afforestation work in various parts of the country has achieved great success. The spring afforestation work in East China, Central South, and Southwest China has basically concluded, with a total of over nine million mu of land afforested.
    In order to supply the timber needed for various construction projects, the southern regions have focused on implementing the policy of "vigorously developing timber forests" during the spring afforestation. Hunan Province, a key forestry province in the Central South region, planted more than 700 million seedlings, mainly fir and pine, for timber forests in ninety counties and cities. Hubei Province developed over 600,000 mu of timber forests such as pine and fir. In East China, large quantities of Chinese fir forests were cultivated in the Minjiang River basin of Fujian, the Huangshan mountainous area of Anhui, and in the areas of Longquan, Kaihua, and fifteen other counties in Zhejiang. The Southwest region plans to cultivate over two million mu of timber forests this year. The northern provinces mainly focus on protection forests. The Northeast region plans to afforest more than 182,000 hectares this year, focusing on creating the West Manchurian protection forest belt. In order to protect industry and transportation from water damage, water conservation forests are being created in the Songhua River basin and the upstream mountainous areas of the Laohe River and Raoyang River. South Manchuria began afforestation in early April. Farmers and fishermen in the Dalian-Lushun area started as soon as the land thawed, and have now afforested more than 1,900 hectares. Farmers in various parts of North Manchuria also started planting trees by mid-April. The Inner Mongolia region plans to afforest 270,000 mu this year, mostly protection forests. Farmers in North China and Northwest China are also actively engaged in afforestation.
    In order to support national construction, the enthusiasm of farmers for afforestation is unprecedentedly high. In order to enable Chinese fir to quickly become a forest, farmers have broken with old habits and improved Chinese fir planting techniques. Farmers in Liukou Township, Xiuning County, Anhui Province, began planting Chinese fir after opening up the mountains this year, changing the past practice of planting Chinese fir three years after opening up the mountains. Farmers in Meixi Township used to plant Chinese fir around the Grain Rain solar term (around April 20th), but this year they also started earlier. A mutual aid team in Yaqian Town, Yuexi County, planted twenty mu of barren mountains, and jointly afforested fourteen mu on public mountains. The afforestation achievements in many areas have exceeded the original plans.
    This year, the proportion of mutual aid and cooperation in spring afforestation in various places has also increased compared to the past. For example, in the 350 mu of afforestation tasks completed in Yangu Township, Qiyang, Hunan, cooperative afforestation accounted for 98 percent. Among the 297 households participating in afforestation in Shuxikou, Huitong County, 201 households were organized to carry out cooperative afforestation. Under the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation committees, 38 townships in Changting County, Fujian Province, organized and improved 234 afforestation mutual aid teams and afforestation groups for afforestation.
    This spring, party and government leading organs in various places have attached great importance to afforestation work. All provinces have issued instructions and made specific arrangements. Combining with the general line propaganda, the forestry departments in various places vigorously implemented the forestry policy of "villages plant, villages own; groups plant, groups own; whoever plants owns," greatly increasing the enthusiasm of farmers for afforestation.

    春季造林工作已获得很大成绩
    【本报讯】　全国各地春季造林工作已获得很大成绩。华东、中南和西南等地春季造林工作已基本结束，共约造林九百多万亩。
    南方各地为了供应各项建设所需木材，春季造林中着重贯彻了“大力营造用材林”的方针。中南区重点林业省份湖南省在九十个县、市栽植了七亿多株以杉松为主的用材林木。湖北省营造松杉等用材林六十多万亩。华东区在福建的闽江流域、安徽的黄山山区和浙江的龙泉、开化等十五个县的地区，营造大批杉木林。西南区今年计划营造用材林二百多万亩。北方各省以防护林为主，东北区今年计划造林十八万二千多垧，以营造西满防护林带为重点，并为保护工业和交通运输不受水害，在松花江流域和老哈河与绕阳河上游等山地营造水源涵养林。南满从四月上旬就开始造林，旅大市区农民和渔民从土地解冻时开始，现已造林一千九百多垧。北满各地农民到四月中旬也就动手植树。内蒙地区计划今年造林二十七万亩，大部是防护林。华北、西北等地农民也正在积极造林。
    为了支援国家建设，各地农民造林积极性空前高涨，农民们为了使杉木能够迅速成林，在插杉中打破了旧习惯，改进了插杉技术。安徽省休宁县流口乡农民今年开山以后就插上杉木，改变过去开山三年再插杉的习惯。梅溪乡农民过去到谷雨前后才插杉，今年也提前开始。岳西县衙前镇一个互助组栽了二十亩荒山，另在公山上合作造林十四亩。很多地区的造林实绩都超过了原计划。
    今年各地春季造林中互助合作的比重也比过去增加，如湖南祁阳沿沽乡完成的三百五十亩造林任务中，合作造林占百分之九十八。会同县疏溪口参加造林的二百九十七户中，有二百零一户是组织起来进行合作造林的。福建省长汀县三十八个乡在互助合作委员会领导下，组织和健全了二百三十四个造林互助组和造林小组，进行造林。
    各地党政领导机关今春对造林工作都很重视，各省都先后发出指示并作了具体安排。各地林业部门结合总路线宣传大力贯彻了“村种村有、伙种伙有、谁种谁有”的林业政策，大大提高了农民造林积极性。
