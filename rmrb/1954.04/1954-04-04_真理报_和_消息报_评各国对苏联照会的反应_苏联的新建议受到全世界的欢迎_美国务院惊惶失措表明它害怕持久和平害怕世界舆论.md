Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS reports from Moscow: "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published articles on April 3, commenting on the reactions of various countries to the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on March 31.

    Aleksandrov pointed out in "Pravda": The Soviet government, in its note, put forward a concrete plan of action for maintaining and strengthening world peace, and first and foremost, strengthening peace in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union's new proposals have been warmly welcomed and actively supported by the broad masses of people concerned about maintaining and consolidating peace. Many political leaders of differing tendencies in Western countries and some newspapers have emphasized that, from the point of view of the vital interests of the people of European countries, the principles on which the Soviet note is based are of great significance. They pointed out that there is now a real hope of solving the problem of guaranteeing collective security in Europe.

    However, some people in the United States are not concerned with maintaining and strengthening peace, but with inciting war hysteria in order to expand armaments so that American monopoly capitalists can reap huge profits. These people are extremely annoyed by the Soviet proposals and cannot hide it. It is noteworthy that as soon as Washington received the Soviet government's note, the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department panicked and insisted that the Soviet Union's new proposals were arousing the same fierce opposition as had already been shown in Berlin. But wasn't the Soviet government's note precisely a response to the objections expressed by the Western countries in Berlin? The State Department's statement was devoid of content, but it showed that certain people in the United States are unwilling to abandon their policy of establishing military blocs.

    However, the statements of American diplomatic officials cannot kick aside the issues raised by reality itself. That is why the U.S. State Department's attitude has been condemned in Europe. Even those Western Europeans who criticized the Soviet proposals firmly pointed out that there is no reason to go down the road suggested by Washington. Now, governments of all countries, especially the governments of all major powers, can no longer ignore the desire of the people of all countries for lasting peace. This is the most important feature of the current international situation.

    "Izvestia" published an article signed by "Observer." The article said that the newspapers of the people's democracies and the progressive newspapers of the capitalist countries welcomed the proposals in the Soviet note, considering it a new step towards further easing international tensions.

    The article pointed out that peace and the security of the people of all countries require, first and foremost, that the major powers seriously study all proposals related to this matter. However, the attitude of the U.S. State Department towards the Soviet proposals cannot but arouse surprise. Before the U.S. State Department in Washington had even received the full text of the Soviet note, it had, without any reason, practically rejected the Soviet proposals. This panicked attitude of the U.S. State Department can only be explained by fear of world opinion. Everyone knows that world opinion firmly demands that the major powers take concrete steps to further ease international tensions. At the same time, this also shows that the U.S. State Department does not even trust its own North Atlantic Treaty partners, and therefore wants to present them with a fait accompli of rejecting the Soviet proposals.

### “真理报”和“消息报”评各国对苏联照会的反应  苏联的新建议受到全世界的欢迎  美国务院惊惶失措表明它害怕持久和平害怕世界舆论

    “真理报”和“消息报”评各国对苏联照会的反应
    苏联的新建议受到全世界的欢迎
    美国务院惊惶失措表明它害怕持久和平害怕世界舆论
   【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”和“消息报”在四月三日发表文章，评论各国对苏联政府三月三十一日致法、英、美三国政府照会的反应。
    亚历山德罗夫在“真理报”上指出：苏联政府在照会中提出了维持和加强世界和平，首先是加强欧洲和平的具体行动计划。因此，苏联的新建议得到了关心维持与巩固和平的广大人士的热烈欢迎和积极支持。西方国家许多倾向不同的政治领袖和一些报纸都着重指出：从欧洲各国人民切身利益的观点来看，苏联照会所根据的原则有重大意义。他们指出：现在已经有解决保障欧洲集体安全问题的实际希望了。
    但是，美国有些人关心的不是维持和加强和平，而是煽动战争歇斯底里，以便扩充军备，使美国垄断资本家从中捞取高额利润。苏联的建议使得这些人烦恼不堪，想掩饰都掩饰不住。值得注意的是：华盛顿一接到苏联政府的照会，美国国务院的发言人就惊惶失措，硬说苏联的新建议正引起在柏林已经表明的同样激烈的反对意见。但是，苏联政府的照会不正是答复了西方国家在柏林所表示的反对意见吗？国务院的声明毫无内容，不过表明了美国的某些人士不愿意放弃建立军事集团的政策。
    但是美国外交官员的声明并不能一脚踢开现实本身提出来的问题。这就是美国国务院的态度在欧洲遭到谴责的原因。甚至是那些对苏联的建议提出批评的西欧人士都坚决指出：没有什么理由走华盛顿所建议的那条路了。现在，各国政府，首先是所有的大国政府，已经不能无视各国人民对持久和平的愿望。这就是目前国际局势最主要的特征。
   “消息报”刊载了由“观察家”署名的一篇文章。这篇文章说：人民民主国家的报纸和资本主义国家的进步报纸都欢迎苏联照会中的建议，认为这是进一步缓和国际紧张局势的新步骤。
    文章指出：和平与各国人民的安全首先要求各大国认真研究有关这方面的一切建议。但是，美国国务院对苏联建议的态度不能不引起人们的惊奇。美国国务院的代表在华盛顿还没有收到苏联照会的全文之前，就毫无理由地在实际上拒绝了苏联的建议。美国国务院这种惊惶失措的态度，只能解释为害怕世界舆论。大家知道，世界舆论坚决要求各大国采取具体步骤来进一步缓和国际紧张局势。同时，这还说明美国国务院甚至不相信自己的北大西洋公约夥伴，因此想使它们面临拒绝苏联建议的既成事实。
