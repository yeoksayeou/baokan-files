International Public Opinion Demands a Successful Geneva Conference, Condemns the US's Provocative Policies of Undermining Peace
    "Oppose America's Attempt to Expand the War"
    The "Neues Deutschland" editorial on the 14th stated: "The People's Republic of China will participate in the Geneva Conference as a major power, with the same equal rights, alongside the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This conference provides a practical opportunity to ease international tensions through the peaceful resolution of outstanding issues." The newspaper further stated: "The issues to be resolved in Geneva—peaceful resolution of the Korean question and restoration of peace in Indochina—not only concern the people of all Asia but also, to some extent, Germany, because any deterioration of international tensions in any part of the world will cause violent reactions here. The war waged by the US imperialists against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been used by the governments of imperialist countries as an excuse to further divide and undermine all negotiations aimed at the peaceful reunification of Germany. They are using this war to promote a 'policy of strength' in West Germany and to support the revival of German militarism. The struggle of the people of all countries around the world to defend peace, inspired by the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, and the heroic struggle of Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have prevented Germany from becoming a second Korea."
    The “Berlin Daily” editorial on the 15th said: "Dulles must know that since the Korean War, the forces of peace seeking to ease international tensions have become stronger. At that time, the United States was still able to force other Western countries to jointly wage war against the Korean people. However, today, the world peace movement will force the governments of these countries to disagree with the United States' war plans."
    "Märchent Zeitung" published a commentary on the 14th saying that the Geneva Conference will prove that as long as the United States abandons its attempt to expand the Indochina war, it is possible to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and end the Indochina war. The newspaper warned Dulles that "the people of the world demand peace. They will pay close attention to the Geneva Conference and resolutely oppose all attempts by the United States to undermine the negotiations and expand the war."
    "Resolve Asian Issues Peacefully"
    The Karachi Peace Committee recently passed a resolution calling on the people of Pakistan to urge the Geneva Conference to resolve Asian issues peacefully.
    The resolution stated that the upcoming Geneva Conference will, for the first time, provide conditions for the five major powers to discuss the peaceful resolution of various issues in the Far East. The resolution pointed out that any threats and destructive acts that use the slander of China's participation in the Indochina war as an excuse to take "joint action" in the region should be universally condemned. The resolution called for a ban on US hydrogen bomb tests and reiterated the Stockholm Declaration's demand to ban the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, advocating the resolution of all outstanding disputes through negotiation and consultation. The resolution called on the people of Pakistan to strengthen unity and fight for the realization of these demands.
    "Asian Countries Unite to Resist US Aggression"
    The "Rangoon Daily" pointed out that the United States is paving the way for its intention to directly participate in the Indochina war, and therefore it is greatly slandering China's "intervention" in the Indochina war. "The purpose of the United States in doing this is to stage a new drama according to the Korean War." Dulles's so-called "joint action" is to drag America's allies along as "fellow sufferers" in the Indochina war.
    The "Rangoon Daily" said, "Judging from the current actions of the United States, Burma has been seriously threatened." The United States deliberately uses "communist threats" to intimidate, but in reality, the United States is attempting to occupy Burma and other Southeast Asian countries. We want to warn the United States that Burma will never be fooled by imperialism again. We should unite to oppose the expansion of the Indochina war and protest the United States' conspiracy. Asian countries must unite to resist the United States' aggressive policies so that we can avoid being dragged into the war as scapegoats.
    The "Progress" pointed out that the United States' slander of China's "intervention" in the Indochina war and its clamoring for "joint action" is a step in the United States' attempt to "internationalize" the Indochina war.
    "The Burmese" said that the United States wants to "internationalize" the Indochina war, and Dulles is taking provocative actions against China. Asians are very clear about Dulles' motives. "Only negotiations between France and the Vietnamese people fighting for independence are a good way to end the war. French public opinion also knows that if the Vietnam War is internationalized according to the United States' proposal, it will inevitably lead to a madman's tragedy."
    "Dulles Does Not Want to Restore Peace in Indochina"
    The "Tribune" weekly in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, commented on the 8th: "The fact that Dulles issued this war cry on the eve of the Geneva Conference in response to the demands of the French people and the people of the world to end the Indochina War shows that Dulles does not have the goal of restoring peace in Indochina through consultations in Geneva in his mind at all." The weekly criticized Dulles's slander against China, saying: "He is determined to obstruct any agreement at the Geneva Conference. He deliberately slanders in advance, wanting to shift the responsibility for destroying the conference in this way. But what is the basis for this slander? Everyone knows that it is the American imperialists who sent planes to help the French invaders slaughter the people of Indochina, not the Chinese people. The facts show that this excuse cannot deceive anyone, especially not the Asian people who have completely seen through the United States' aggressive policies."
    "Peacefully Resolve the Korean and Indochina Issues"
    Under the auspices of the League of Korean Democratic Patriotic Youth in Japan, representatives of Korean residents in Japan, Japanese trade union organizations, and mass organizations in Tokyo held a "Youth Evening Party in Support of the Geneva Conference" in Tokyo on the evening of April 2. Eight hundred people attended the evening party.
    A resolution was passed at the meeting demanding a peaceful resolution of the Korean and Indochina issues. The resolution also called for a ban on the use of atomic weapons, opposition to the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," and opposition to Japan's rearmament.
    "US Hydrogen Bomb Tests Are an Attempt to Undermine the Geneva Conference"
    The Vice President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, winner of the Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace," and British national, Monica Felton, said at a reception hosted by the Bombay Peace Committee on the 13th, welcoming her, that the United States' testing of hydrogen bombs on the eve of the Geneva Conference was an act attempting to undermine the scheduled talks.
    Mrs. Felton opposed the expansion of the Indochina War and called on the people of the world to mobilize public opinion to stop this dirty war.
    Mrs. Felton pointed out that Syngman Rhee had threatened that if the Geneva Conference failed to "unify his country," he would attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Mrs. Felton said: The reason why Syngman Rhee would have such delusions is because he is convinced that once the Korean War breaks out again, he will definitely get the support of the United States.
   "The People of Indochina Should Be Independent From All Countries"
    A leading figure of the Bevanite faction of the British Labour Party, Bevan, published an article in the Bevanite faction's organ, "Tribune" weekly, on the 14th.
      In this article, Bevan criticized British foreign policy for being subservient to the United States. He pointed out that since the beginning of the Second World War, British diplomacy has been dependent on the United States. He wrote: "This makes us indefinitely subject to blackmail." "In Washington, they have become quite shameless in this regard. They say, 'They will eventually follow in our footsteps.'"
     Bevan said that Britain has "succumbed to American pressure." Britain has allowed the return of the industry in the Ruhr to German monopoly capitalists, has allowed itself to be dragged into a larger arms program than it can afford, and has slandered China, following others' guidance, as an aggressor in Korea. He said: "There is little we can do, because we are unwilling to take the effort to oppose American pressure to the point where it might break." When talking about the Marshall Plan, Bevan said that it has degenerated into merely a military aid program. He said: "Now Washington is issuing such threats: unless we act according to the pace it agrees to, this quartermaster will stop paying."
    Bevan then talked about the Geneva Conference, saying, "Now, this dirty and miserable situation is developing to a climax. People want us to destroy it before the Geneva Conference is held." He believes that the Geneva Conference is the only hopeful thing produced by the Berlin Conference. "But this hope disappeared once the United States made it clear that it would not…recognize revolutionary China under any circumstances." Bevan asked: Then why invite China to participate in the Geneva Conference? He also asked: "Are we going to hold negotiations or carry out intimidation? Make peace or make war? Extend a friendly hand or carry out hydrogen bomb threats?" "We demand to know now—before the (Geneva) conference is held."
    Bevan said: "The people of Indochina must be independent from all countries." He said: "There is no way to limit this. If the people of Indochina are willing to accept the Communist Party, then they should be allowed to do so." Bevan pointed out that the so-called Southeast Asian alliance that the United States is asking Britain to join is not intended as a tool to prevent war, but rather to expand the protection of American interests internationally. He said: The so-called excuse of "military threat" "is a cover for counter-revolutionary measures. What people are inviting us to join is not an alliance to maintain peace, but a fortress against political and social progress." "Wherever such progress is blocked by colonial regimes or dark reactionaries, the struggle there becomes increasingly revolutionary. Then people want us to oppose this struggle in the form of resisting communist aggression." Bevan said that if the United States insists on establishing the Southeast Asian and West Pacific alliance it has proposed, it should receive such a clear answer: "Do it yourself!"
    "Dulles's Trip to Western Europe Was a War Mission"
    The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 12th, commenting on US Secretary of State Dulles's recent mission to London and Paris, saying: "Dulles's trip to Western Europe has one goal: to obstruct peace and expand the Indochina War. In fact, Dulles himself shamelessly admitted that this was his mission. This is a war mission."
    The editorial said: "This is an unbelievable situation (but it is very educational for us Americans): The White House shouts day and night that if 'communism' expands to the 'barn,' 'we are in danger.' Of course, in this 'barn' there is also the 'tin, oil, tungsten and rubber' that Dulles and Eisenhower talked about greedily. But these all belong to the people of Asia."
    The editorial continued: "Where is the so-called 'communist expansion'? There is none. In Indochina, there are only foreigners from the 'free world.' France launched this war eight years ago, and this war has never been able to get the slightest support from the people of Indochina."
    The editorial pointed out: "In fact, one of Dulles's big problems is that no one in the world wants this war to continue except for Dulles, Eisenhower, and McCarthy, who are afraid of peace. But what about us Americans? The whole world is clamoring for an end to this massacre, is there the same outcry here in the United States? It is indeed a fact that most Americans abhor this war and do not want to participate in it…The American people are extremely opposed to the goal that Dulles is desperately trying to achieve."
    The editorial concluded: "We ask everyone to shout loudly to the government now, demanding that Washington agree to an immediate ceasefire and agree to a truce at the Geneva Conference on April 26. Immediately withdraw all US aid to the Indochina War. Immediately withdraw air force personnel."

### 各国舆论要求开好日内瓦会议抨击美国破坏和平的挑衅政策

专栏：

    各国舆论要求开好日内瓦会议抨击美国破坏和平的挑衅政策
    “反对美国扩大战争的企图”
    “新德意志报”十四日的社论说：“中华人民共和国将以大国身份，以同样平等的权利，和苏联、美国、英国、法国一道参加日内瓦会议。这一会议提供了通过和平解决悬而未决的问题来缓和国际紧张局势的实际机会。”该报又说：“将在日内瓦解决的问题——和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平——不仅关系到全亚洲人民，而且在一定程度上关系到德国，因为在世界任何地区引起的国际紧张局势的恶化都会在这里引起剧烈的反应。美帝国主义者对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的战争，被帝国主义国家政府用作借口，以进一步分裂和破坏一切为使德国和平地恢复统一而进行的谈判。他们利用这个战争来在西德鼓吹‘实力政策’，并支持德国军国主义的复活。全世界各国人民在苏联的一贯的和平政策鼓舞之下所进行的保卫和平的斗争，以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争，已经防止了德国变为第二个朝鲜。”
    “柏林日报”十五日的社论说：“杜勒斯必须知道，在朝鲜战争以后，力求缓和国际紧张局势的和平力量已经更壮大了。在那时候，美国还能强迫西方其他国家来对朝鲜人民进行共同的战争行动。然而，在今天，世界和平运动将强迫这些国家的政府不同意美国的战争计划。”
    “马琴报”十四日发表评论说，日内瓦会议将证明：只要美国放弃它的扩大印度支那战争的企图，和平解决朝鲜问题和结束印度支那战争是可能的。该报警告杜勒斯说，“世界人民都要求和平。他们将密切地注意日内瓦会议，并且坚决地反对美国破坏谈判和扩大战争的一切企图。”
    “以和平方式解决亚洲问题”
    喀喇蚩和平委员会最近通过决议，号召巴基斯坦人民促使日内瓦会议以和平方式解决亚洲问题。
    决议说，即将举行的日内瓦会议将第一次为五大国商谈以和平方式解决远东各项问题提供条件。决议指出，任何以诬蔑中国参加印度支那战争为借口、以便在该地区采取“联合行动”的威胁和破坏行为，都应受到普遍的谴责。决议要求禁止美国的氢弹爆炸试验，并重申斯德哥尔摩宣言关于禁止使用原子武器和其他大规模屠杀的武器的要求，主张以谈判与协商方式解决一切悬而未决的争端。决议号召巴基斯坦人民加强团结，为实现这些要求而斗争。
    “亚洲国家联合起来抵抗美国的侵略”
    “仰光日报”指出，美国正在为打算直接参加印度支那战争铺平道路，因此它大肆诬蔑中国“干预”印度支那战争。“美国这样做的目的是想按照朝鲜战争来排演一幕新剧。”杜勒斯所谓“联合行动”，就是要把美国的盟国拖着一道来充当参加印度支那战争的“伴死鬼”。
   “仰光日报”说，“就目前美国的行动来看，缅甸已受到了严重的威胁”。美国故意以“共产党威胁”来进行恫吓，实际上是美国企图占领缅甸等东南亚国家。我们要警告美国，缅甸决不再上帝国主义的当了。我们应该团结起来反对印度支那战争的扩大，抗议美国的阴谋行动。亚洲国家必须联合起来抵抗美国的侵略政策，才能使我们避免卷入战争作人家的替死鬼。
    “进步报”指出，美国诬蔑中国“干预”印度支那战争，叫嚣采取“联合行动”，是美国企图使印度支那战争“国际化”的一个步骤。
   “缅甸人报”说，美国想使印度支那战争“国际化”，杜勒斯采取向中国挑衅的行为，杜勒斯这种动机亚洲人是很清楚的。“只有法国和为独立而战的越南人民进行谈判是结束战争的好办法，法国的舆论也知道如果按照美国的主张使越南战争国际化，则必然产生疯子的悲剧”。
    “杜勒斯不想恢复印度支那和平”
    锡兰首都科伦坡的“特兰”周刊八日评论说： “杜勒斯在日内瓦会议前夕发出这种战争叫嚣，以答复法国人民与全世界人民提出的结束印度支那战争的要求，这个事实说明：在杜勒斯的思想里，根本不存在通过在日内瓦的协商以恢复印度支那和平的目标。”该周刊抨击杜勒斯对中国的诽谤说：“他一心想阻挠在日内瓦会议上获得任何协议，他蓄意事先就进行诽谤，想这样来转嫁破坏会议的责任。但是这种诽谤有什么根据呢？每一个人都知道，派遣飞机去帮助法国侵略者屠杀印度支那人民的是美帝国主义者而不是中国人民。事实说明这种托辞骗不了任何人，尤其是骗不了已经彻底看清楚美国的侵略政策的亚洲人民。”
    “和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题”
    在旅日朝鲜民主爱国青年联盟主持下，东京的旅日朝鲜侨民、日本工会组织和群众团体的代表于四月二日晚在东京举行了“拥护日内瓦会议青年晚会”。参加晚会的有八百人。
    会上通过决议，要求和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题。决议还要求禁止使用原子武器、反对美日“共同防御援助协定”、反对日本重整军备。
    “美国试验氢弹是想破坏日内瓦会议”
    国际民主妇女联合会副主席、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、英国的蒙尼卡·费尔顿夫人十三日在孟买和平委员会所主持的欢迎她的招待会上说：美国在日内瓦会议前夕试验氢弹，是一种企图破坏预订的会谈的行为。
    费尔顿夫人反对扩大印度支那战争，并号召全世界人民动员舆论来制止这一肮脏战争。
    费尔顿夫人指出，李承晚曾扬言，假使日内瓦会议未能“统一他的国家”，他将进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。费尔顿夫人说：李承晚之所以会有这种妄想，是因为他确信一旦朝鲜战争再度爆发，他一定会得到美国的支持。
  “印度支那人民应脱离一切国家而独立”
    英国工党有势力的比万派领袖比万十四日在比万派机关刊“论坛”周刊上发表一篇文章。
      比万在这篇文章中抨击英国外交政策屈从美国。他指出，从第二次世界战争一开始，英国的外交就一直依附着美国。他写道：“这使我们无限期的受到敲诈。”“在华盛顿，他们在这方面已变得相当可耻。他们说，‘他们最后会跟在我们屁股后面的。’”
     比万说，英国已经“向美国的压力屈服”。英国已经允许把鲁尔区的工业交还给德国垄断资本家，已经让自己被拖入到一个无力负担的比前更大的军备计划中去，并随着人家指点，诬蔑中国是在朝鲜的侵略者。他说：“我们所能采取的办法很少，因为我们不愿把反对美国压力的努力进行到可能破裂的程度。”比万在谈到马歇尔计划时说它已经堕落成为仅仅是一个军事援助计划了。他说：“现在华盛顿发出了这样的威胁：除非我们按他所同意的步调行动，否则这位军需官将停止支付了”。
    比万接着谈到日内瓦会议，他说，“现在，这个肮脏而可怜的事态正发展到高潮。人家要我们在日内瓦会议召开前就把它破坏。”他认为日内瓦会议是柏林会议所产生的唯一令人抱有希望的东西。“但是一经美国表明，不会在任何情况下……承认革命的中国时，这种希望就消失了。”比万问道：那么为什么邀请中国参加日内瓦会议呢？他又问道：“我们要举行谈判还是进行恐吓？缔造和平还是制造战争？伸出友好的手来，还是进行氢弹威胁？”“我们要求现在——举行（日内瓦）会议之前——就知道”。
    比万说：“印度支那人民必须脱离一切国家而独立。”他说：“对于这一点是无法加以限制的。如果印度支那人愿意接受共产党，那末，就应该让他们这样做”。比万指出，美国要求英国加入的所谓东南亚联盟，不是要作为防止战争的工具，而是图谋把对于美国利益的保护扩张到国际方面。他说：所谓的“军事威胁”的借口“是反革命措施的掩护品。人家正在请我们参加的不是一个维护和平的联盟，而是一个反对政治和社会进步的堡垒。”“不论在那里，只要这种进步被殖民政权或黑暗的反动派阻挡的地方，那里的斗争就带有愈来愈多的革命色彩。接着人家就要我们以抵抗共产党侵略的形式来反对这种斗争。”比万说，如果美国坚持要建立它所建议的东南亚和西太平洋联盟，它就应该得到这样明明白白的答复：“你们独自去干吧！”
    “杜勒斯西欧之行是一个战争使命”
    纽约“工人日报”十二日发表社论，评论美国国务卿杜勒斯最近访问伦敦和巴黎的使命说：“杜勒斯的西欧之行有一个目标，那就是阻挠和平、扩大印度支那战争。事实上，杜勒斯本人也恬不知耻地承认了这就是他的使命。这是一个战争使命。”
    社论说：“这是一种令人难以置信的情况（但是它对我们美国人有很大的教育意义）：白宫夜以继日地叫嚷说，假如‘共产主义’扩张到‘谷仓’的话，‘我们就危险了’。当然，在这个‘谷仓’里面，还有着如杜勒斯与艾森豪威尔所馋涎欲滴地谈到的‘锡、石油、钨与橡胶’。但是，这些都是属于亚洲人民的。”
    社论接着说：“所谓‘共产主义扩张’在那里呢？什么地方都没有。在印度支那，只有来自‘自由世界’的外国人。法国在八年以前发动了这场战争，这个战争一直没有能够得到印度支那人民的丝毫支持。”
    社论指出：“事实上，杜勒斯的一个大问题是：世界上除了害怕和平的杜勒斯、艾森豪威尔与麦卡锡之流以外，没有人要这场战争继续下去。但是我们美国人怎么样呢？全世界都大声疾呼要求结束这场屠杀，在美国这里是不是有同样的呼声呢？要说大多数美国人厌恶这场战争，不愿意参加这场战争，那确是一个事实。……美国人民是极端反对杜勒斯拼死拼活想要达到的目标的。”
    社论最后说：“我们要求大家现在向政府大声疾呼，要求华盛顿同意立刻停火，并在四月二十六日举行的日内瓦会议上同意停战。立刻撤回美国给予印度支那战争的一切援助。立刻撤回空军人员。”
