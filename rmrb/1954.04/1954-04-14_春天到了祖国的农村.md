Spring Comes to the Countryside of the Motherland
　　Sending Farm Tools to the Countryside
　　Spring plowing has already begun on the plains of northern Jiangsu. Workers are rushing to produce various farm tools for the peasant brothers.
　　On the rivers and roads near Yancheng, many small boats and large carts are fully loaded with adzes, cart axles, socketed spades, large shovels, iron spades, harrows, and other farm tools, being transported to supply and marketing cooperatives in various places.
　　The local state-owned Yancheng Jianghuai Farm Tool Factory has changed from a one-shift system to a two-shift system to support farmers' spring plowing, ensuring that the machines never stop. The workers have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in production. Veteran workers Ding Lianqi and Zhou Jiaqing did not miss a single day of work in the first quarter of this year.

　　On the Banks of the Fuchun River
　　The mountains on both sides of the Fuchun River are covered in tender green, and countless peach and plum blossoms are in full bloom. Pairs of swallows skim over the river. The Fuchun River, winding for over a hundred kilometers, looks even more beautiful.
　　This year's Fuchun River is more prosperous than in previous years. As the saying goes, "When the willows turn green, fishing yields less than a catty." In the past, people mostly regarded spring as the off-season for fishing, but this year is different. Fishermen can be seen everywhere along the river repairing their boats and fishing nets, preparing for the upcoming season for Chinese shad.
　　The farmers on the riverbank have also begun their spring plowing in earnest. Whenever the sun appears over the river, they start working: repairing and manufacturing farm tools, carefully selecting rice seeds, plowing the land, and irrigating the fields.
　　This year, the spring plowing preparations of farmers along the river are more thorough than in previous years. Farmers in Tonglu County rushed to repair more than 4,400 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects before spring plowing, and farmers in Jiande County launched a mass fertilizer accumulation campaign before spring plowing.

　　New Lambs on the Grassland
　　Spring has slowly arrived on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia beyond the Great Wall. The staff of the Huitengliang State-Owned Stud Sheep Breeding Farm have begun busily assisting with lambing.
　　Soviet "Tsigai" breed sheep are raised here, and they have more than tripled in the past three years. They have also been used to breed with more than 15,000 ewes belonging to nearby farmers and herdsmen.
　　Before lambing began, people started various preparations: paying attention to protecting the fetal sheep; ensuring that sheep are not beaten or driven too fast, and that they do not eat ice and snow. Because the staff can carefully raise the ewes, none of the more than 200 ewes in the farm aborted. Before the lambing season, two lambing rooms were built on the farm. The staff formed four shifts to take turns on duty to look after the sheep.
　　On February 16th, when the first adorable lamb was born, the staff were extremely happy. They busily washed their hands with disinfectant and carefully handled the lamb's umbilical cord.
　　This spring, because the entire farm staff carried out the lambing work with preparation, there were no deaths among the lambs delivered.

　　Making Banzao Lake a Rich Granary
　　The farmers by Banzao Lake in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, welcomed spring with joy.
　　The large-scale water conservancy project on the lake shore has already begun. After the project is completed, the situation of "nine floods in ten years" will be permanently changed.
　　Banzao Lake is located on the right bank of the Ying River in Anhui Province, in a low-lying area. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the outlets for draining the lake were often blocked, causing frequent flooding. Now, the People's Government has decided to dredge five irrigation canals near the lake and build embankments, culverts, and flood discharge channels. After the project is completed, the people along the Banzao Lake can divert lake water to irrigate their land and switch to growing rice. According to preliminary estimates, 4,700 mu of land can be converted to rice cultivation. Based on a yield of 300 jin of rice per mu, this could produce 1.41 million jin of grain.
　　Now, thousands of laborers by Banzao Lake are changing the face of Banzao Lake with creative labor, turning it into a rich granary.

　　Exchanging New Rice Seeds for Farmers
　　Farmers in Hangxian County, Jiangnan, have begun sowing. In front of the State-owned Hangxian Farm, people are crowding every day to exchange for new rice seeds.
　　Last year, the farm improved its cultivation techniques and adopted the "10509" rice seed. The rice harvest was abundant, with an average yield of 692 jin per mu, about 50% higher than the average yield of local farmers. Before the autumn harvest, the farm held a field crop exhibition, and farmers came from all over to visit. They saw the good crops on the farm with their own eyes and recognized the benefits of the "10509" new rice seed.
　　For more than a month, many farmers have been coming here by boat, carrying loads on their shoulders, or pushing carts, asking to exchange for the excellent "10509" variety. The farm staff warmly receive them and do their best to meet their demands.

　　Unforgettable Gathering
　　The First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Yubai Township, Meixian County, Guangdong, held its first "Patriotic Inspection" day in mid-March after its establishment. Representatives from nearby townships were sent to participate, including village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and representatives of individual farmers.
　　At the cooperative members' meeting, Cooperative Director Zeng Hanrong reported to all members and guests the production achievements of the past month: soybeans and peanuts were planted in six days, which would have taken more than ten days during the mutual aid period; six irrigation canals were repaired with eighty workdays, which would have taken one hundred and eighty workdays in previous years; and preparatory work for farming has been completed fifteen days ahead of schedule, whereas in previous years it would only begin at this time. The guests listened to Zeng Hanrong's report with admiration.
　　After the meeting, the cooperative members led the guests in groups to the fields for visits and inspections. Mutual aid team leader and labor model Ling Qinglan pointed to the full fertilizer pen and said enviously, "Without the cooperative, we would definitely not be able to accumulate so much fertilizer." Zeng Qingchao, a representative from Yutangxia Village, agreed with Ling Qinglan and added, "We used to take care of ourselves, some accumulated and some didn't, now we've only accumulated a little bit." The guests were particularly interested in the orchard behind the village. They squatted around the young trees, gently stroked the leaves, and asked the cooperative members questions. Mutual aid team leader Zeng Qifang said, "It is indeed impossible for our mutual aid team to manage such a large orchard."
　　After the guests visited and inspected, they all said that they would learn from the agricultural production cooperative, establish a mutual aid and cooperation network, and elect Cooperative Director Zeng Hanrong to lead them.

    春天到了祖国的农村
    把农具送到农村去
    春耕已在苏北平原开始了。工人们正在为农民兄弟赶制各种农具。
    盐城附近的河里和大道上，许多小船、大板车满载着鑱头、车川、套尖、大锹、铁锨、钉耙等农具，运到各地供销合作社去。
    地方国营盐城江淮农具厂，为了支援农民春耕生产，已将一班制改为两班制，做到人停机器不停。工人们在生产中发挥了高度的积极性，老师傅丁连启、周家庆，在今年第一季度生产中没有缺过一次勤。
      在富春江边
    富春江两岸的山峦披上了嫩绿，数不清的桃花、李花已经盛开，对对的燕雀掠江而过。逶迤百余公里的富春江显得更加秀丽了。
    今年的富春江比往年更加繁荣。俗话说：“日到杨柳青，捕鱼不上斤。”过去，人们多把春季当作捕鱼的淡季，但是今年不同了，江边到处可以看到渔民们在修理船只和鱼网，迎接即将到来的鲥鱼汛期。
    江岸的农民也紧张地开始了春耕。每当太阳在江上露面的时候，他们就开始劳动：修理、制造农具，精选稻种，翻耕土地，把水灌到田间去。
    今年沿江农民的春耕准备工作，比往年做得更加充分。桐庐县农民在春耕前赶修了四千四百多处中小型水利工程，建德县农民在春耕前开展了群众性的积肥运动。
      草原上的新羊羔
    春天姗姗地到了塞外的内蒙古草原。灰腾梁国营种羊繁殖场的工作人员，开始忙着接羊羔。
    这里饲养着苏联“茨盖”种羊，三年来，它已增殖了三倍多。还给附近农牧民的一万五千多只母羊配了种。
    在没有开始接羔以前，人们就为接羔开始了各种准备工作：注意保护羊胎；保证不打羊、不快赶羊，不给羊吃冰雪。由于职工们能精心饲养母畜，全场二百多只母羊中没有一只流产。在接羔期前，场内就修好了两间接羔室。职工编成了四个班，轮流值班看管羊群。
    二月十六日，头一只可爱的羊羔落地时，职工们高兴极了，忙着用消毒药水洗手，审慎地处置羊羔的脐带。
    今年春天，因为全场职工有准备地进行了接羔工作，在所接产的羊羔中没有发生死亡的现象。
    要使班草湖成为富饶的米仓
    安徽省颍上县班草湖边的农民，怀着喜悦迎接了春天。
    湖岸规模巨大的水利工程已经开始。工程完成后，这里将永远改变“十年九涝”的情况。
    班草湖在安徽省颍河右岸，地势低洼。在国民党反动统治时期，排泄湖水的沟口时被堵塞，经常泛滥成灾。现在，人民政府决定在湖的附近疏挖五条灌溉渠，修筑围堤、涵闸和溢洪道。工程完成后，班草湖沿岸的人民就可以引湖水灌溉自己的土地，改种水稻。据初步估计，将有四千七百亩土地可以改种水稻，以每亩收三百斤稻子计算，就可产一百四十一万斤粮食。
    现在，班草湖边成千的民工，正以创造性的劳动改变班草湖的面貌，使它成为富饶的米仓。
      把新稻种换给农民
    江南杭县农民已开始播种。国营杭县农场的门前，每天都拥挤着前来换取新稻种的人们。
    去年，农场改进了耕作技术，并采用了“一○五○九”号稻种，水稻丰收，每亩田的平均产量为六百九十二斤，比当地农户的平均产量高百分之五十左右。秋收前，农场举行了田间作物展览会，农民们从各乡赶来参观。他们亲眼看到了农场上的一片好庄稼，认识了“一○五○九”新稻种的好处。
    一个多月来，许多农民坐着船、挑着担子，或推着车子到这里，要求换取“一○五○九”号的优良品种。农场的工作人员热情接待他们，并尽最大的努力来满足他们的要求。
    难忘的欢聚
    广东梅县虞白乡第一农业生产合作社，在三月中旬举行了建社后的第一个“爱国检查”日。附近各乡都派代表来参加，其中有乡村干部、互助组长和单干户的代表。
    社主任曾汉荣在社员大会上向全体社员和客人们报告了一个月来生产的成绩：用六天时间种完了在互助时要十多天才能种完的黄豆和花生；用八十个工修好了在往年要一百八十工才能修好的六条水圳；往年这个时候才开始做田，现在备耕工作已经提前十五天完成了。客人们用羡慕的心情倾听着曾汉荣的报告。
    会后，社员们带领客人们分组到田里去参观和检查。互助组长、劳动模范凌庆兰指着满栏的肥料羡慕地说：“不是合作社，一定积不到这么多的肥料。”虞塘下村代表曾庆巢同意凌庆兰的看法，跟着说：“我们是各顾各，你积他不积，现在才积了一点点。”客人们对村后一片果园特别感到兴趣。他们围着幼树蹲下，轻轻地抚摩着叶子，向社员们问这问那。互助组长曾启芳说：“种这样大的果园，我们互助组的确办不到。”
    客人们参观、检查过后，都说要向农业生产合作社学习，要建立一个互助合作网，推选社主任曾汉荣来领导。
