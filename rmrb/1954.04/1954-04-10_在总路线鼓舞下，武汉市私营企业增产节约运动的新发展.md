    New Development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Wuhan's Private Enterprises Under the Encouragement of the General Line
    Wen Xiang, Deputy Director of Wuhan Increase Production and Practice Economy Inspection Committee
    In the fourth quarter of last year, after studying the general line of the transition period, the increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises made further progress and achieved the following results: (1) Comprehensively completed the state's processing and ordering tasks for the fourth quarter of last year in terms of quality and quantity, exceeding the original plan by 6%; (2) Improved and upgraded production. According to the statistics of 40 factories, in the fourth quarter of last year, workers put forward a total of 402 rationalization proposals related to improving tools, quality specifications, production management, safety and hygiene, and conservation, increasing production and saving 7.7 billion yuan of wealth; (3) Strengthened the planning of production. Among 230 key factories, 10 formulated preliminary operation plans, 90 formulated general production plans, and 130 formulated specific plans based on processing and ordering contracts; (4) Strengthened the work of democratizing enterprise management and strengthened the leadership of the Party and trade unions over private enterprises. Among 230 key factories, 15 factories, under the leadership of the Party branch, absorbed representatives from the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and the capitalists to organize the increase production and practice economy committee, and 110 factories, under the leadership of the Party and trade union, established production meetings, recommending more than 100 outstanding workers and staff members to participate in administrative management.
      Taking Guaranteeing the Completion of the State's Processing and Ordering Tasks as the Center
    The increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises in the fourth quarter of last year was carried out with guaranteeing the completion of the state's processing and ordering tasks in terms of quality, quantity, and on time as the center.
    The increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises began after the "Five-Anti" movement. However, in the past, due to incomplete planning and insufficient coordination in various aspects, the state's processing and ordering plans often could not be completed on schedule, and the increase production and practice economy movement in private enterprises also encountered many difficulties. In order to change this situation, before the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement in the fourth quarter of last year, Wuhan's state-owned commercial departments, based on the state plan, market needs, and the production capacity of private industry, proposed a more comprehensive processing and ordering plan by industry. This greatly strengthened the planning of processing and ordering.
    After the processing and ordering tasks were determined, the general line of the transition period was vigorously promoted to the workers. In addition to the district committees making arrangements and mobilizing people separately, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a conference of private enterprise workers' representatives (including cadres). During the conference, the representatives clarified the state's policies on capitalist industry and commerce and the great significance of processing and ordering. The representatives expressed their determination to return to the factories to improve production and ensure the completion of processing and ordering tasks. Some people also exposed the illegal acts of some capitalists in falsely reporting productivity, falsely reporting costs, and using substandard materials at the meeting. They also reviewed their past errors in working in private enterprises without peace of mind and insufficient understanding of processing and ordering tasks. After these trade union cadres returned to the factories, they widely communicated the spirit to the workers, put forward the slogan of ensuring the completion of the state's processing and ordering tasks. The workers said: "In the past, we thought that working in private enterprises was not as glorious as working in state-owned enterprises. Today, we know that production in private enterprises also contributes to socialist construction." Experience has proved that wherever the general line is publicized thoroughly and deeply, the masses are mobilized well, and the workers' enthusiasm for production is raised.
    The industrial and commercial administrative management departments also strengthened their leadership over the movement. The main measures were to expand the management scope of processing and ordering and to further implement the mass line in the management of processing and ordering. The original regulations stipulated that only units with an order value of 50 million yuan or more and processing labor costs of 20 million yuan or more would be managed. This was later changed to be managed by the municipal and district industrial and commercial administrative departments regardless of the quantity of processing and ordering. In order to prevent evasion of management, it was further stipulated that when each processing unit signs processing and ordering contracts with private factories and inspects their implementation, it should maintain close contact with the trade union organizations of each factory. Private factories accepting processing and ordering, regardless of the quantity, must report to the factory's trade union and obtain the supervision of the workers. In this way, the mass line in the management of processing and ordering was further implemented, and the supervision of capitalists' compliance with state laws was strengthened.
      Starting with the Formulation of Production Plans
    After the increase production and practice economy movement is launched, it is also necessary to pay attention to solving the key problems in production at any time. The central link here is to strengthen the production planning work. Because private enterprises vary in size and the problems are complex, strengthening the production planning work must be based on different situations and take different approaches.
    The first type of factories are those with a relatively good mass base, which have undergone democratic reforms and production reforms, and have few problems within the enterprise, and whose processing and ordering unified purchase and marketing tasks are relatively normal. The key to these factories lies in formulating operation plans and establishing a production responsibility system based on production tasks, so that production tasks can be completed on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. The specific approach is to first solve the key problems in the main workshops, find out the details, and determine production indicators, then drive the auxiliary workshops to formulate personal and group production plans, and in the process of formulating the plans, solve ideological problems that hinder production, and take specific measures to solve technical problems and labor organization problems that hinder production (improving operating methods, adjusting labor organization, etc.). On this basis, workshops or groups conclude contact contracts and launch challenges to form a surge of production competition. Some factories have also formulated operation plans and initially established a production responsibility system on this basis.
    The second type of factories have normal processing and ordering tasks, a certain mass base, but have not undergone systematic production reforms, and the enterprise is internally chaotic. These types of factories should start with mobilizing workers to discuss processing and ordering contracts and formulate production plans. By formulating plans, they can improve the production enthusiasm of the workers and, under the guidance of the plan, purposefully solve specific problems within the enterprise, such as adjusting labor organization, appropriately solving the reasonable requirements of workers in terms of life and welfare, giving play to the potential capacity of enterprise equipment, adding necessary production tools, and promoting and supervising the capitalists to improve business management through planning, and catching up with the first type of factories.
    The third type of factories are mainly small factories and handicraft workshops, with scattered production, some trade union organizations being joint grassroots committees, a weak mass base, and unfixed processing and ordering tasks, but they also undertake some processing and ordering tasks. The main approach for this type of factory to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement is to specify the processing and ordering contracts. This is to promote the capitalists to calculate three accounts: First, how much work has been received? How much has been done? How much is left undone? Second, how much labor and time is required to complete the undone work? Third, how much raw material is in stock and can it supply the needs of the unfinished project? The capitalists should formulate a draft plan, and then mobilize the workers to discuss and revise it, and sign a labor patriotic pact to ensure that they improve technical operations, strengthen labor discipline, supervise the capitalists' illegal acts, and ensure that they deliver goods on time, with quality and quantity. Enterprises that have done this can generally complete the state's processing and ordering tasks, and the enterprise's business management may also improve.
      Implementing Democratic Management and Strengthening Party Leadership
    The increase production and practice economy movement in private enterprises must be combined with improving business management, and the central link in improving business management lies in raising the status of the working class within the enterprise, establishing the leading core of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union, strengthening the Party's leadership over private enterprises, implementing democratic management, uniting and promoting the capitalists to improve production, supervising the capitalists' compliance with state laws, and preventing their illegal acts. After the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises, it was revealed that the capitalists' administrative management could not keep up with the needs of the development of the production movement, and the phenomena of blind operation, speculation, bloated organization, overstaffing, chaotic system, and no one being responsible were very serious. Due to the limitations of capitalist ownership and capitalist management methods, capitalists are not effective in improving, and once criticized and supervised by workers, they are also constrained and afraid to manage. Therefore, strengthening the Party's leadership over private enterprises, implementing democratic management, and enabling labor and capital to act under unified leadership has become an urgent issue.
    There are many forms of leadership in the increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises, which can be roughly divided into the following types: The first type is the establishment of an increase production and practice economy committee led by the Party organization in the enterprise, with the participation of trade unions, capitalists, and technical management personnel to handle major issues related to production management and production. The second type is the production meeting established under the leadership of the Party and the trade union, with the participation of the capitalists. In the case where an increase production and practice economy committee has been established in the factory, its responsibility is mainly to implement the resolutions of the increase production and practice economy committee on production matters and ensure the completion of production tasks. This meeting is guided by the increase production and practice economy committee together with the capitalists' factory affairs meeting; in the case where an increase production and practice economy committee has not been established in the factory, the production meeting basically assumes the dual tasks of the increase production and practice economy committee and the production meeting, and is responsible for leading the production of the entire factory and promoting the implementation of production tasks; the production improvement committee and the planning research meeting jointly formed by labor and capital and led by the capitalists actually play the role of the production meeting. On the basis of consensus between labor and capital, it leads the production of the enterprise and decides on major production issues. The third type is the administrative factory affairs meeting of the capitalists, which is composed of the heads of various business departments and engineering and technical personnel in the factory (trade union representatives can attend as nonvoting delegates), and is presided over by the capitalist manager or factory director, mainly focusing on the formulation of production plans, financial plans, ensuring the timely supply of raw materials to the production department, ensuring that special funds are used for special purposes, and undertaking business and solving management-related issues arising from production at any time. Since some section chiefs and cadres in the factory are recommended worker cadres, this meeting also plays a certain supervisory role in the administrative affairs and financial issues of the capitalists. In addition, there is the labor-capital consultation meeting, which also plays a certain role in promoting and supervising production in factories where conditions are not available to establish the above-mentioned meetings. The above-mentioned forms have played different degrees of promoting role in strengthening the Party's leadership over capitalist industry, uniting and promoting capitalists to improve business management, further inspiring workers' enthusiasm for production, and supervising capitalists to ensure the completion of tasks.
      Promoting Advanced Experience and Attaching Importance to Technical Exchanges
    There was a widespread phenomenon of technical backwardness in Wuhan's private enterprises. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, the machine industry undertook the state's tasks of manufacturing diesel engines, cement mixers, and sanitary water pipes. The scrap rates of some parts such as "pistons," "cylinder sleeves," and "female heads" reached 100%, and the average scrap rate was also above 40%. On the other hand, some workers are ideologically conservative, stick to conventions, do not seek improvement, and even satirize and attack the progress of others, and some even talk about superstition. Therefore, improving technology is an extremely important issue in improving and upgrading production. In the fourth quarter of last year, in response to this situation, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions promptly convened a foundry technology symposium for private machinery factories, adopting a method that combined technical exchanges and political education to solve the problem of defective foundry products. For example, the scrap rate of "female heads" in Minjian Machinery Factory decreased from 100% to 20%, and the scrap rate of Hanli Machinery Factory decreased from 36% to 14.9%. After this technical exchange, advanced experience was widely promoted in conjunction with product exhibitions.
      Strengthening Education for Capitalists
    With the increase in processing and ordering and the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in the fourth quarter of last year, it is very important to carry out education on the general line and patriotic observance of the law to the capitalists of these enterprises. Through these educations, they must be enabled to guarantee the supply of raw materials after accepting processing and ordering tasks, and improve the business management system, and learn planned production. According to Wuhan's experience, the methods of education can be summarized as follows: (1) Through the industry's increase production and practice economy branch, organize the capitalists by industry and location, divide them into several groups, lead them to study the general line, listen to their opinions and problems, explain and solve them in a timely manner, and often educate them to make them understand the knowledge of production management, so that they actively participate in production and improve business management; (2) Through the organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, hold symposiums, experience exchange meetings, and invite relevant responsible comrades to make reports to promote their patriotic observance of the law and to study production; (3) Strengthen education and transformation work within the enterprise through the increase production and practice economy committee and the production meeting.
      Relying on the Unified Leadership of the Party
    The increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises was developed on the basis of the "Five-Anti" movement. In order to maintain the power of unified leadership, an increase production and practice economy committee was established under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government. Its main characteristics are as follows:
    (1) Through it, the Party and the People's Government formed a unified leadership over capitalist industry and commerce. The members of this committee included the Party's united front departments, the government's industrial and commercial, trade, labor, taxation, banking and other units, and the Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations, etc. The committee established an office to handle daily work.
    (2) Through it, a broad system of mass character was formed from the city and districts to the industry and factories. The city has a city increase production and practice economy inspection committee, each district has a branch, and the industry has a branch (the branches of each district in Wuhan are divided into machinery, light industry, handicraft, commercial and other types to form industry branches), to the factories (large factories are under the leadership of the district branch, and general small and medium-sized factories are under the leadership of the industry branch).
    In short, the implementation of the Party's unified leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of the increase production and practice economy movement in private enterprises.
    Although the increase production and practice economy movement in Wuhan's private enterprises has achieved some results and experience, this is only one aspect of the work of transforming private enterprises in a planned and step-by-step manner, and it is only the beginning of this work. Transforming private enterprises is an arduous and complex task. We must never be satisfied with this little achievement and experience. We should also carry out a lot of work. We believe that only under the leadership of the Party, relying on the workers, humbly learning economic and political work, closely combining with the financial and economic system and the relevant departments and state-owned enterprises, unifying our steps, and moving forward together, can we achieve greater success in the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    在总路线鼓舞下，武汉市私营企业增产节约运动的新发展
    武汉市增产节约检查委员会副主任　文祥
    去年第四季度，在学习过渡时期总路线后，武汉市私营企业的增产节约运动有了进一步的发展，并且取得了如下的成绩。（一）全面地按质、按量完成了去年第四季度国家的加工订货任务，并且超过原计划百分之六；（二）改进和提高了生产。根据四○家工厂的统计，去年第四季度，工人群众共提出了有关改进工具、品质规格、生产管理、安全卫生和节约等合理化建议四○二件，增产节约了七十七亿元的财富；（三）加强了生产的计划性，在二三○家重点工厂中，有十家制订了初步作业计划，有九十家制订了一般生产计划，有一三○家根据加工订货合同订出具体计划；（四）加强了企业管理民主化的工作，加强了党、工会对私营企业的领导。在二三○家重点工厂中，有十五家工厂在党支部的领导下，吸收工会、青年团及资本家代表组织了增产节约委员会，有一百一十家工厂在党和工会的领导下，成立了生产会议，共推荐了一百名以上优秀工人、职员参加了行政管理工作。
      以保证完成国家加工订货任务为中心
    去年第四季度武汉市私营企业的增产节约运动，是以保证按质、按量、按时完成国家加工订货任务为中心而开展起来的。
    武汉市私营企业的增产节约运动，在“五反”运动后即已开始。但是过去由于计划不周密，各方面的配合也不够，国家加工订货计划往往不能保证按期完成，私营企业的增产节约运动也发生很多困难。为了改变这种情况，去年第四季度增产节约运动展开以前，武汉市国营商业部门即根据国家计划，根据市场需要和私营工业的生产能力，提出了比较全面的和按行业的加工订货计划。这样，大大加强了加工订货的计划性。
    加工订货任务确定以后，又大张旗鼓地向工人宣传了过渡时期总路线。除经由区委分别进行布置动员外，市工会联合会召开了私营企业职工代表（包括干部）大会，会中使代表明确了国家对资本主义工商业的政策和加工订货的重大意义，代表们纷纷表示一定回厂搞好生产，保证完成加工订货任务，有的人并在会议上揭露了某些资本家虚报生产力，虚报成本，偷工减料的不法行为；对自己过去在私营企业工作不安心，对加工订货任务认识不足的错误态度也作了检讨。这些工会干部回厂后，向工人群众进行了广泛的传达，提出了保证完成国家加工订货任务的响亮口号，工人们说：“过去认为在私营企业中工作不如在国营企业工作光荣，今天才知道在私营企业生产，对社会主义建设也有贡献。”经验证明：那里的总路线宣传得透，宣传得深，那里群众就发动得好，工人的生产积极性就提得高。
    工商行政管理部门也加强了对运动的领导。主要是扩大了加工订货的管理范围，和进一步贯彻了加工订货管理工作中的群众路线。加工订货管理办法原规定订货金额在五千万元、加工工缴在二千万元以上的单位才管理后改为不问加工订货数量多少，统分别由市区工商行政部门管理起来。为了防止逃避管理。更规定各加工单位与私营工厂签订加工订货合同和检查其执行情况时，应与各厂工会组织取得密切联系，各私营工厂承接加工订货，不论数量大小，均须向该厂工会提出报告，取得工人的监督。这样，便进一步贯彻了加工订货管理工作中的群众路线，加强了对资本家遵守国家法令的监督。
      从制订生产计划入手
    增产节约运动开展起来以后，还必须随时注意解决生产上的关键问题，这里中心环节在于加强生产计划工作。由于私营企业大小不一，问题复杂，加强生产计划工作，又必须根据不同情况，采取不同的作法。
    第一类型工厂，即群众基础较好，经过民主改革，生产改革，企业内部存在的问题不多，而加工订货统购包销任务又比较正常的工厂，其关键在于根据生产任务，制订作业计划和建立生产责任制，使生产任务按月、按旬、按日完成。具体做法，就是首先解决主要车间中的关键问题，摸清底细，确定生产指标，然后带动辅助车间，制订个人和小组生产计划，并在订计划的过程中，解决有碍生产的思想问题，对有碍生产的技术问题、劳动组织问题等，采取具体办法予以解决（改善操作方法，调整劳动组织等）。在此基础上，各车间或小组间订立联系合同，展开挑战应战，形成生产竞赛的热潮。有的工厂并在这个基础上制订了作业计划和初步建立了生产责任制。
    第二类型工厂，加工订货任务正常，有一定的群众基础，但未经过系统的生产改革，企业内部混乱。这一类型的工厂，应从发动工人讨论加工订货合同，制订生产计划入手，通过订计划提高工人群众的生产热情，并在计划指导下，有目的地解决企业内部存在的具体问题，如调整劳动组织，适当地解决工人生活福利等方面的合理要求，发挥企业设备潜在能力、增添必要的生产工具，并通过计划推动和监督资方改善经营管理，向第一类型工厂看齐。
    第三类型工厂，主要是小型工厂和手工业作坊，生产分散，有的工会组织是联合基层委员会，群众基础不强，加工订货任务不固定，但也承接有一些加工订货任务，这一类型工厂开展增产节约运动的主要作法，是把加工订货合同具体化，这就是推动资方算三笔账：第一、接了多少活？已经做了多少？还有多少没有作？第二、没有做的活要好多工和多少时间才能够完成？第三、存有多少原材料，是否可以供应未完工程的需要？由资方订出计划草案，然后发动工人讨论修正，订立劳动爱国公约，保证提高技术操作，加强劳动纪律，监督资方不法行为，保证按期、按质、按量交货。这样做了的企业，一般均能完成国家的加工订货任务，企业的经营管理也可能提高一步。
      实行管理民主化加强党的领导
    私营企业的增产节约运动必须与改善经营管理相结合，改善经营管理的中心环节又在于提高工人阶级在企业内的地位，建立党、青年团、工会的领导核心，加强党对私营企业的领导，实行管理民主化，团结和推动资本家搞好生产，监督资本家遵守国家法令，防止其不法行为。武汉市私营企业增产节约运动开展后，暴露了资方的行政管理赶不上生产运动发展的需要，盲目经营，投机取巧，机构臃肿，人浮于事，制度混乱，无人负责等等现象十分严重。资本家由于资本主义所有制和资本主义经营方法的限制，改进不力，一经工人批评和监督，又束手束脚，不敢管理。因而加强党对私营企业的领导，实行管理民主化，使劳资双方在统一领导下行动起来就成为一个迫切问题。
    武汉市私营企业增产节约运动的领导有许多形式，其中大致可分以下几种：第一类由企业中党组织领导成立增产节约委员会，吸收工会、资方和技术管理人员参加，处理有关生产管理和生产方面的重大问题。第二类是在党和工会领导下成立的，吸收资方参加的生产会议。生产会议在厂内已建立增产节约委员会的情况下，它的职责主要是贯彻增产节约委员会关于生产方面的决议，保证生产任务的完成，该会与资方厂务会议同受增产节约委员会指导；在厂内未建立增产节约委员会的，生产会议基本上就担任了增产节约委员会和生产会议双重的任务，负责领导全厂生产，推动生产任务的执行；由劳资双方共同组成的，由资方领导的如生产改进委员会、计划研究会，实际起生产会议的作用，在劳资双方获得一致意见的基础上，领导企业的生产，决定生产的重大问题。第三类资方的行政厂务会议，由厂内各业务部门的负责人和工程技术人员组成（工会代表可以列席），由资方经理或厂长主持，主要环绕生产计划拟定财务计划，保证及时供应生产部门的原料，保证专款专用，和承接业务及解决生产上随时产生的有关管理上的问题等，由于厂内部分科长、干部是被推荐的工人干部，通过这个会议，对资方的行政事务和财务问题，也起到一定的监督作用。此外，还有劳资协商会议，它在条件未具备成立上述各种会议的工厂中也起到了对生产一定的推动和监督作用。以上几种形式，对加强党对资本主义工业的领导，团结和推动资本家改善经营管理、进一步启发工人生产热情，监督资方保证任务的完成都起了程度不同的推动作用。
      推广先进经验，重视技术交流
    武汉市私营企业曾普遍存在技术落后的现象，如机器业去年第四季度承接国家柴油机、水泥搅拌机和卫生水管的任务，有的零件如“活塞”“套缸”“母头”报废率均达百分之百，平均报废率也在百分之四十以上。另方面，有些工人思想保守，墨守成规，不求改进，甚至对旁人的进步讽刺打击，有的还讲迷信。因此，提高技术是改进和提高生产的一个极为重大的问题。去年第四季度武汉市工会联合会针对这种情况，及时召开了私营机器厂翻砂技术座谈会，采取技术交流和政治教育相结合的方法，解决了翻砂的废品问题，如民建机器厂翻砂“母头”废品率由百分之百降到百分之二十，汉利机器厂由百分之三十六降到百分之十四点九，通过这次技术交流以后，又结合产品展览，普遍推广了先进经验。
      加强对资本家的教育工作
    随着去年第四季度加工订货的增加和增产节约运动的开展，向这些企业资方进行总路线、爱国守法的教育，是十分重要的。通过这些教育，要使他们在接受加工订货任务以后，保证原材料供应，并改善经营管理制度，学习计划生产。根据武汉市的经验，教育的方法概括起来有下面几点：（一）通过行业增产节约支会把资本家按行业、地段组织起来，分成若干小组，领导他们学习总路线，倾听他们的意见和问题，及时加以解释、解决，并经常教育他们，使之懂得生产管理的知识，使其积极参加生产，改善经营管理；（二）经过工商联的组织召开座谈会、经验交流会，并请有关负责同志作报告，推动他们爱国守法和钻研生产；（三）在企业内部通过增产节约委员会和生产会议，加强教育和改造工作。
      依靠党的统一领导
    武汉市私营企业的增产节约运动，是在“五反”运动基础上发展起来的，为了保持统一领导的力量，在中共武汉市委和市人民政府的领导下成立了增产节约委员会，它的主要特点有如下的两方面：
    （一）通过它形成党和人民政府对资本主义工商业的统一领导。这个委员会的成员包括有党的统一战线部门，政府方面的工商、贸易、劳动、税务、银行等单位和工会联合会、工商联合会组织等，委员会成立了办公室，负责处理日常工作。
    （二）通过它形成市、区以至行业工厂带群众性的广大系统。市有市增产节约检查委员会，各区有分会，行业有支会（武汉市各区分会之下分机器、轻工、手工、商业等类型成立行业支会），以至工厂（大的工厂属区分会领导，一般中小厂由行业支会领导）。
    总之，贯彻党的统一领导是私营企业增产节约运动迅速发展的根本保证。
    武汉市私营企业增产节约运动虽已取得了一些成绩和经验，但这只是有计划有步骤地改造私营企业工作的一个方面，并且仅仅是这个工作的开始。改造私营企业是一件艰巨的复杂的工作，我们决不应当以这一点成绩和经验为满足，我们还应该进行许多工作。我们相信，只有在党的领导下，依靠工人群众，虚心学习经济工作和政治工作，密切结合财经系统和各有关部门和国营企业，统一步调，合力前进，只有这样，对逐步实现资本主义工商业的社会主义改造才能取得更大的成绩。
