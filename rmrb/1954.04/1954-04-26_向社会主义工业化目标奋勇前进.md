    The new Caitun Shaft will be handed over to production
    The largest pair of newly built shafts in Northeast China, the Caitun Shaft, will be handed over to production in October this year.
    Benxi coal is a valuable coking coal for smelting high-quality steel, and Soviet experts call it "black gold." After the shaft begins production, this underground "black gold" will be poured out in large quantities to serve our country's industrialization. Various machinery, electric drills, and transportation equipment are currently being installed underground.
    After this pair of shafts is completed, coal mining will be done using coal cutters and "combines," followed by pneumatic picks. Coal transportation will be done through scrapers, transferred to belt conveyors, transported to underground "coal bins," automatically loaded into hoisting skips, lifted to the ground, and transported to the coal preparation plant by belt conveyors. The entire process will only take sixty minutes.
    This pair of shafts has various precision safety devices underground, and the motors all use the new Soviet-produced explosion-proof type. There are also first-aid stations, waterproof doors, safety ladders, dust suppression sprayers, equipment to prevent gas explosions, waiting rooms, and clinics underground. On the ground, a five-story "combined welfare building" with a steel and concrete structure that can accommodate more than a thousand people will be built, with showers, warm rooms, sun lamp rooms, health clinics, and other welfare facilities. This will ensure the safety of coal miners underground and comfort above ground.
    The state-owned Anhui Paper Mill is put into production
    The newly built state-owned Anhui Paper Mill officially went into production on April 16.
    The Anhui Paper Mill is a modern paper-making factory. This factory was designed independently by our country's designers after learning from advanced Soviet experience, and most of the various machines used were also manufactured domestically. Construction of the factory began in June 1951, and after more than two years of hard work by the workers, it was completed on March 20 this year. Recently, it has undergone more than 20 days of trial production, and the machines are running well. From raw materials to finished paper, currently, except for manual operation for picking materials, the rest are operated by machines.
    The Anhui Paper Mill is currently producing typing paper. Two months later, it will produce a large amount of high-quality cigarette paper for a long time to supply the needs of the cigarette industry.
    The expansion project of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is underway
    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will be expanded into a manufacturing plant of machine tools with high production capacity. The expansion project is currently underway. The expansion project will bring about a fundamental change to the entire plant: in terms of production, from scrap iron, casting to processing and assembly, manual and semi-manual operations will be transformed into mechanized and automated production, and all will form assembly line operations; in terms of transportation, from the entry of materials into the plant to the exit of finished products, mechanical handling equipment such as automobiles, trams, cranes, conveyors, and roller belts will be used. The working conditions of workers will also be greatly improved. Each workshop is equipped with welfare facilities such as changing rooms, showers, and flush toilets. Ventilation and heating equipment are also very good, so that the workshop can always maintain fresh air and a suitable temperature. After the completion of the entire expansion project, the plant's production capacity will be several times higher than it is now. If the increased output were to be obtained by building a new factory, it would take at least five years and require a large investment. Now, expanding on the existing basis will only take two to three years and save at least half of the investment compared to building a new factory.
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's heavy engineering tasks, the employees overcame the difficulties of insufficient scaffolding workers and untimely supply of timber, and overfulfilled the first quarter plan with a score of 120 percent.
    Wuxi Waterworks will deliver water before May Day
    On Beidu Mountain in the Taihu Lake scenic area, a modern waterworks will be completed before May Day.
    Wuxi is an industrial city with hundreds of large and small factories and hundreds of thousands of residents. However, before liberation, the entire city had only fifteen artesian wells and some earthen wells. In the Zhou Shanbang area, a residential area for working people, nearly a hundred families shared an earthen well, and people lined up to draw water in the middle of the night. By noon, the water buckets contained yellow mud, and people were still queuing.
    In 1952, the Wuxi Municipal People's Government, in accordance with the needs of the people and production, decided to build a modern waterworks. Soon, various diameters of water pipes were transported from Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Northeast China and Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. These pipes totaled more than 3,000 tons and stretched for eighty-eight li when connected. After more than a year of hard work by the pipe-laying workers, these pipes surround the city's streets and alleys and are buried five feet underground. With the progress of the pipe-laying project, the reservoir that can hold more than 10,000 tons of water has also been completed.
    Construction workers and employees of the waterworks enthusiastically launched a labor competition to strive to deliver clear water from Taihu Lake to factories and residents in the city before May Day.
    All seven pilot tunnels of Wushao Mountain are opened
    All seven pilot tunnels in the Wushao Mountain area of ​​the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway have been opened.
    The seven tunnel projects of Wushao Mountain were undertaken by the Tunnel Engineering Team and the Fifth Engineering Section, respectively. Encouraged by the slogan of "Penetrating Wushao Mountain," the workers worked day and night, overcame difficulties such as thin air and landslides and water seepage, and completed the arduous task of opening the pilot tunnels ahead of schedule. Five tunnels were opened before April. The last two tunnels to be opened were all on a reverse curve with a radius of 300 meters. The tunnels were full of hard rocks and sand-夹 stones, and a large amount of spring water often gushed out of the cracks in the rocks; among them, No. 4 tunnel once gushed out 289 tons of water in one day and night. Because the tunnel was a downhill, all the water flowed to the front end of the pilot tunnel. The workers often stood in water deeper than their knees, draining water and opening the mountain. After tenacious struggle, the pilot tunnel was finally opened on the afternoon of April 6. Following this victory, No. 5 tunnel was also opened ten days ahead of schedule by the employees of the 19th Engineering Area at 10:50 on the 8th. Workers entering the tunnel can breathe fresh air from now on, and speed up the work of expanding, digging the bottom, and pouring concrete. Let the track laying work pass through the tunnel and extend westward according to the scheduled plan.
    The renovation project of Liaoxi Petroleum Plant No. 5 is under full construction
    The long-range vacuum distillation renovation project of Liaoxi Petroleum Plant No. 5 is now under full construction. This project is very important for improving the utilization rate of the plant's equipment and bringing into play the potential power of the enterprise. After the completion of the long-range vacuum distillation renovation and put into production, the existing production capacity of the plant can be increased several times, and the country can create more than 1 billion yuan of wealth every month.
    After realizing the importance of the renovation project, the basic construction workers of Petroleum Plant No. 5 have high work enthusiasm and launched a labor competition starting in March. Wang Gengfa and Li Shusen joint group workers said: The country's construction of one yuan should be used as two yuan, and we should also do the work of two people by one person. As a result, they completed the plan ahead of schedule and ensured the quality. Wang Shuting's team had never made pipe hoops before, and everyone was very anxious. Lu Zhanjiu thought: "If the pipe hoops can't be made, the pipes can't be installed, which will affect production. Whether we can guarantee the completion on schedule depends on us now." Later, he remembered seeing a model for making pipe hoops when he was an apprentice. The next day, before dawn, he told the team leader about this method. As a result of the experiment, work efficiency doubled.

    向社会主义工业化目标奋勇前进
    新建彩屯竖井将移交生产
    东北新建的竖井中最大的一对竖井——彩屯竖井，将在今年十月移交生产。
    本溪煤是炼优质钢铁的贵重炼焦煤，苏联专家称之为“黑色黄金”。竖井开始生产后，这地下“黑色黄金”，将源源不断地大量倾泻出来，为我们国家工业化服务。现井下正在安装着各种机械、电钻、运输设备。
    这一对竖井建成后，采煤是用截煤机、“康拜因”，其次是风镐。运煤是通过刮溜子，传给皮带运输机，运到井下“煤仓”，自动地装入提升箕斗升到井上，经卸煤装置，由皮带运输机运到选煤厂，全部时间只要六十分钟。
    这对竖井井下有各种精密的安全装置，电动机都采用苏联新出产的防爆型的。井下还有包扎所、防水门、安全梯、防尘喷雾器、防止瓦斯爆炸的设备及候车休息室、医务所等福利设施。井上，将建设一座可容千余人的钢筋混凝土结构的五层“联合福利大楼”，内部设有淋浴室、暖室、太阳灯室、卫生所等。保证煤矿工人下井安全，上井舒服。
    国营安徽造纸厂投入生产
    新建的国营安徽造纸厂，已在四月十六日正式投入生产。
    安徽造纸厂是一座现代化的造纸工厂。这个工厂是我国设计人员学习了苏联先进经验后自行设计的，所用的各种机器也绝大部分是国内所制造。从一九五一年六月开始建厂，经过工人们两年多的辛勤劳动，到今年三月二十日全部完工，最近又进行了二十多天的试车生产，机器运转情况良好。该厂从原料到制成纸张，目前除了拣料用手工操作外，其余都是用机器进行操作。
    安徽造纸厂现在生产的是打字纸，两个月以后，将长期生产大量品质优良的卷烟纸，供应卷烟工业的需要。
    沈阳第一机床厂扩建工程紧张进行
    沈阳第一机床厂将扩充成为具有高度生产能力的工作母机制造厂，目前扩建工程正紧张进行。扩建工程将使全厂起一个根本变化：在生产上，从碎铁、铸造到加工、装配，都将由手工业和半手工业操作走上机械化自动化生产，并全部形成流水作业；在运输上，从材料入厂一直到成品出厂，都将用汽车、电车、吊车、运输带、滚轴带等机械搬运设备。工人的劳动条件也将大大改善。每个车间都设有更衣室、淋浴室、水洗厕所等福利设施。通风、取暖设备也很好，可使车间经常保持空气清新，温度适宜。扩建工程全部完成后，全厂的生产能力将比现在提高数倍，这些增加的产量，如果用建设新工厂的办法去取得，至少需五年时间，而且投资很大。现在在原有基础上进行扩建，只需两年到三年的时间就行了，而且最少比建设新厂节省一半投资。
    为了保证完成今年繁重的工程任务，职工们克服了架子工不足，及木材供应不及时的困难，以百分之一百二十的成绩，超额完成了第一季度计划。
    无锡自来水厂将在“五一”前送水
    在太湖风景区的北犊山上，一座现代化的自来水厂将在“五一”前完工。
    无锡是个工业城市，有数百个大小工厂，几十万居民，可是，在解放前整个市区只有十五口自流井和一些土井。在劳动人民住宅区周山浜一带，近百家人家合用一口土井，半夜就有人起来排队汲水，到了中午，水桶提上来的水，变成了黄泥浆，汲水的人还排着队。
    一九五二年，无锡市人民政府根据人民群众的要求和生产的需要，决定建设一座现代化自来水厂。不久，从东北鞍山钢铁公司和北京石景山钢铁厂，运来了各种口径的自来水管。这些管子加起来有三千多吨，接起来有八十八里长。经过排管工人一年多来辛勤的劳动，这些管子环绕全市大街小巷，埋到了五尺深的地下。随着埋管工程的进行，可以容纳一万吨以上水量的蓄水池也完工了。
    工地建筑工人和自来水厂的职工，热烈地展开了劳动竞赛，争取在“五一”节以前，把太湖的清水送到市区的工厂和居民的家里去。
    乌鞘岭七个隧道导坑全部打通
    兰新铁路乌鞘岭地区的七个隧道导坑已全部打通。
    乌鞘岭的七个隧道工程，是由隧道工程队和第五工程段分别担任施工的。工人们在“打穿乌鞘岭”口号的鼓舞下，经过日日夜夜地劳动，战胜了空气稀薄和塌方、渗水等困难，纷纷提前完成了打通导坑的艰巨任务。四月以前先后打通了五个隧道。最后打通的两个隧道，全部在一个三百公尺半径的回头弯道上，峒内全是坚石和沙夹石，经常有大量泉水从石缝中喷出；其中四号隧道曾在一昼夜喷出了二十八九吨水，因为峒子是下坡道，这些水全都奔流到导坑的最前端，工人们经常站在深过膝胫的水中一面排水，一面开山，经过顽强的斗争，终于在四月六日下午打通了导坑。紧接着这一胜利，五号隧道也提前十天，在八日十时五十分，被十九工区的职工们打穿了。进入山峒的工人，从此可以呼吸着新鲜空气，加紧进行扩大、挖底及灌注混凝土等工程。让铺轨工作能按照预定计划，通过隧道，向西伸展。
    辽西石油五厂改建工程全面施工
    辽西石油五厂的长减压蒸馏改建工程，现已全面施工。这项工程对提高该厂设备利用率，发挥企业潜在力量作用很大。长减压蒸馏改建竣工投入生产后，可使该厂现有生产能力提高数倍，每月就可为国家多创造十亿元的财富。
    石油五厂基本建设职工认识到改建工程的重要意义后，劳动热情很高，从三月开始就展开了劳动竞赛。王庚法、李树森联合小组工人表示：国家建设一元当两元化，我们也要一个人顶两个人干活。结果他们按计划提前完工了，并保证了质量。王树廷小组，过去没做过管箍，大家都很着急。陆占久想：“管箍做不出来，管子就不能安装，就会影响生产，现在能不能保证按期完工就看我们了。”后来他想到学徒时看过做管箍的模型，第二天不等天大亮，他就把这个办法告诉了组长。试验结果，工作效率提高一倍。
