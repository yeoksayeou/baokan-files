    Factory Workers in Various Locations Invent Many Machines to Replace Manual Labor
      [This newspaper dispatch] Factory workers in various locations, displaying a spirit of technical innovation, have invented many machines to replace manual operations, greatly increasing labor efficiency.
    The workers of the First Workshop of the Shenyang Paper Mill, during the discussion of the national production plan this year, launched a technical innovation movement and found many clever ideas. The most interesting of these is the automatic paper tearing machine created by Li Fugui, a worker in the ironworking group. Originally, the sorting department of this workshop tore paper by hand, which was very inefficient, and the flying dust affected the workers' health. After worker Li Fugui created the automatic paper tearing machine, the manual operation of the sorting department was transformed into mechanized production. One paper tearing machine can replace the operation of one hundred and forty-four workers, saving the state 1.4 billion yuan per year, and there is no dust when the workers operate it.
    A large part of the work in the Seventh Workshop of the State-owned First Rubber Factory involves heavy physical labor. In particular, when repairing iron pipes of three inches or more in diameter, it was very difficult to move the "Dies," requiring four people. The workers would suffer from backaches and sore arms, and sometimes the pipes would be damaged if the four people did not exert force evenly. In order to solve this problem, Xuan Qingyi, the leader of the pipe fitting group, with the help of technicians and workers, successfully created an automatic pipe threading device, increasing labor efficiency by 300 percent. The quality is fully in line with requirements, and only one person is needed to watch the machine. Now, Xuan Qingyi and the workers of the entire group are helping the water and steam group to improve the "Lancashire" furnace, which will make coal adding and ash removal work completely automated.
    The embryo trimming group of the State-owned Hunan Liling Electric Porcelain Factory previously relied entirely on manual operation. Workers held the tools in one hand and the embryo pieces in the other, which was very inefficient, and uneven force could easily lead to defective products. Li Biyuan, an embryo trimming worker, created an embryo trimming machine, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. The work that previously required a Grade 3 worker can now be done by ordinary workers. Currently, he is designing a machine for processing and manufacturing 10-inch suspension porcelain bottles.
    The main production processes of the Liaoxi Fur Factory are all manual operations, such as washing the skins in the river. Washing one thousand skins requires twenty skilled workers. In the cold season, although the workers wear rubber boots, their legs are still susceptible to cold and cramps, and the quality of the washed skins is very poor. Other tasks such as tanning and grinding are also done manually, the working conditions are very harsh, the smell is very strong, and the workers' health is affected. In the technical innovation movement, the factory workers completed the semi-mechanized technical reform of the soaking and shaving workshop. During the reform, the state invested a total of 260 million yuan. After the reform, the savings in wages and other items alone amounted to 530 million yuan per year, production efficiency increased by an average of more than four times, labor conditions were improved, and the quality of fur was improved. For example, after the skin washing work was changed to a rotating drum (a simple machine), only three people were needed to operate it, and the daily output increased from 50 to 330 pieces. The washed skins are bright in color and the leather board is white.

    各地工厂职工创制许多机器代替手工操作
      【本报讯】　各地工厂职工发挥技术革新精神，创制了许多机器代替手工操作，大大提高了劳动效率。
    沈阳造纸厂第一车间职工，在今年讨论国家生产计划中，掀起了一个技术革新运动，找到了很多窍门，其中使人最感兴趣的是铁工组工人李福贵创造的自动撕纸机。原来，该车间选别部是手工撕纸，工作效率很低，并且灰尘飞扬，影响工人身体健康。工人李福贵创造出自动撕纸机后，选别部的手工作业就变成了机械化生产，一台撕纸机可代替一百四十四个工人操作，一年能给国家节约十四亿元，工人操作时也没有灰尘了。
    国营第一橡胶厂第七车间大部都是笨重的体力劳动，特别是修配三寸粗以上的铁管时，用四个人搬“代斯”，还很费劲，累得腰酸胳膊痛，有时四个人使劲不匀，还把管子弄坏了。为解决这个问题，配管组组长玄庆义在技术人员和工人的帮助下，创造自动套管器成功，提高劳动效率百分之三百，质量完全合乎要求，只要一个人看机器就行了。现在玄庆义和全组工人，正帮助水汽组改进“兰克夏”炉，将使添煤、除煤工作完全自动化。
    国营湖南醴陵电瓷厂修胚组，以前完全是手工操作，工人一手拿着工具，一手拿着胚件，工作效率很低，用力不匀又容易出废品。修胚工人李碧元创造了修胚机，效率提高十多倍。以前三级工才能做的活，现在普通工也能做了。目前，他正设计一种加工制造十吋悬式瓷瓶的机器。
    辽西皮毛厂主要生产过程都是手工操作，如在河里洗皮，每洗一千张皮需用二十名技术工人。到水凉的季节，工人们虽穿着胶靴，但腿还是容易受寒患抽筋病，而且洗出的皮子质量很差。其他如鞣皮、磨皮等工作，也都是人工操作，作业条件十分恶劣，臭味很大，影响工人身体健康。该厂职工在技术革新运动中，完成了泡铲车间半机械化的技术改革工作。在改革中，国家投资共二亿六千多万元，改革后，每年仅工资等项节约就达五亿三千多万元，生产效率平均提高四倍以上，改善了劳动条件，提高了皮毛质量。如洗皮工作改用转鼓（简单的机器）后，只用三个人操作，日产量由五十张提高到三百三十张，洗出的皮子毛色鲜艳，皮板洁白。
