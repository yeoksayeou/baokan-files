Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 15th, 148 European and African officers and soldiers of the French army held in the First Prisoner-of-War Camp of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to the French government, requesting a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

The letter stated: We, the prisoners of war residing in the First Prisoner-of-War Camp of Free Vietnam, on the eve of the Geneva Conference scheduled to be held on April 26, 1954, are willing to present our testimony on the Indochina issue, express our thoughts on this issue, and state our attitude towards this issue.

Each of us is more or less responsible for the Indochina War. The French Expeditionary Force has created ruins and suffering and committed countless atrocities in this country. It has suffered one defeat after another. Recently, their attempt to implement the "Navarre Plan" also suffered a disastrous defeat. The Vietnam People's Army and the Cambodian and Laotian People's Liberation Army have achieved new victories. The "mopping-up operations" and brutal repression carried out in the French-occupied areas can only further develop Vietnam's resistance and unite all the Vietnamese people more closely around President Ho Chi Minh. It is foolish to try to make a so-called "government" like that of Bảo Đại and his clique, which in fact and in law cannot represent anyone, compete with the supreme authority and prestige of President Ho Chi Minh. It is enough to recall that President Ho Chi Minh received 99% of the votes in the general election of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 6, 1946.

The letter pointed out: Now no one dares to deny the fact that the US government is interfering in this unjust and criminal war against French interests. The French Expeditionary Force is actually standing guard for the US imperialists. To defend these non-French interests, they are shedding the blood of French and Vietnamese people, and artillery fire and bombing are causing destruction and ruins.

In this way, isn't France losing its national independence in exchange for dollars with blood? If the war continues, France will become increasingly impoverished.

The French people are increasingly protesting this situation. We, the prisoners of war in Free Vietnam, are determined to tell the truth, and we want to protest along with them. The truth is that millions of French men and women, regardless of religious belief or political affiliation, are united in demanding an end to this war and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The letter stated: The news about the holding of the Geneva Conference has brought us great hope. Indeed, this is a big step towards peace, and everyone welcomes it. But before the Geneva Conference, there is a prospect that has always existed, and that is a proper and reasonable solution that millions of French people are looking forward to, that is, to immediately hold negotiations with President Ho Chi Minh, the only true representative of the Vietnamese people, and to quickly implement the "ceasefire" demanded by the French people. Every minute of delay will increase the staggering number of victims and make the disaster even more severe.

The letter concluded: The statements of the responsible persons of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, especially President Ho Chi Minh's answer to the editor-in-chief of the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" last November, fully prove that the Vietnamese people, like the French people, hope to hold peace talks. This just wish is the wish of all French men and women. We, the prisoners of war, officers and soldiers in Vietnam, sincerely hope that the French government will immediately take the necessary steps to hold negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, in order to implement a ceasefire and restore peace in Indochina, in line with the wishes of the Vietnamese, French and people all over the world.

The 148 prisoners of war who signed the above letter included: Lieutenant Colonel Charles Ton Pierre, Lieutenant Colonel Lairage Marcel, Major Briouze André, Lieutenant Diprimolet Bernard, Adjutant Berregoua Raoul, Major Dillion René, Lieutenant Medical Officer Weber Jean, Adjutant Copa Oscar, and Captain Ariou Henri.

    侵越法军被俘官兵一百四十多名写信给法国政府
    要求通过谈判实现印度支那停火恢复和平
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南民主共和国第一战俘营的一百四十八个欧非籍军官与军士，写信给法国政府，要求和平解决印度支那问题。
    信中说：我们这些住在自由越南第一战俘营的战俘，在定于一九五四年四月二十六日召开的日内瓦会议即将来到的时候，愿意提出我们在印度支那问题上的证词，表示我们对这个问题的想法，并表明我们对这个问题的态度。
    我们中间的每一个人多多少少都要为印度支那战争负些责任。法国远征军在这个国家造成了废墟与苦难、施行了无数暴行。它遭到了接二连三的失败。最近，他们想实现“纳瓦尔计划”，又遭到了惨败。越南人民军、高棉和寮国的人民解放军获得了新的胜利。在法占区进行的“扫荡战”与残暴的镇压只能使越南的抗战更加发展，只能使所有越南人民更加紧密地团结在胡志明主席的周围。要想使像保大和他的集团这样的无论在事实上和法律上都不能代表任何人的所谓“政府”和胡志明主席的最高权威和威信分庭抗礼是十分愚蠢的。大家只要回忆一下在一九四六年一月六日越南民主共和国的普选中胡志明主席得到百分之九十九的选票就够了。
    信中指出：现在没有人敢否认美国政府干预这场违反法国利益的非正义的和罪恶的战争的事实。法国远征军实际上是为美帝国主义者站岗。为了保卫这种并非法国的利益，他们使法国人和越南人流着鲜血，炮火与轰炸造成了毁灭和废墟。
    这样，难道法国不是为了用鲜血来换取美元而把民族独立都丢光了吗？战争继续拖下去，法国变得日益贫困了。
    法国人民日益强烈地抗议这种情况。我们这些在自由越南的战俘们有决心把真实情况说出来，我们要和他们共同提出抗议。这种真实情况就是：千千万万法国男女，不分宗教信仰、不分政治党派，团结起来要求停止这场战争，恢复印度支那和平。
    信中说：关于举行日内瓦会议的消息给我们带来了巨大的希望。的确，这是向和平大大迈进了一步，人人都表示欢迎。但在日内瓦会议以前，有一个前途是始终存在着的，这就是千千万万的法国人所盼望的一个应有的合理的解决办法，那就是立刻和越南人民的唯一真正代表胡志明主席举行谈判，以及赶快实行法国人民所要求的“停火”。每迟延一分钟，就会使得牺牲者的惊人数字又有增加，就会使得灾难格外深重。
    信中最后说：越南民主共和国负责人士的声明，尤其是胡志明主席去年十一月答瑞典报纸“快报”主编问，都充分证明越南人民和法国人民一样希望举行和平谈判。这种公正的愿望是法国全体男女的愿望。我们这些在越南的战俘，军官和军士们，诚恳希望法国政府立刻采取必要的步骤，和以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国举行谈判，以便在印度支那实行停火、恢复和平，以符合越南、法国和全世界人民的愿望。
    在上述的信件上签字的一百四十八名战俘里有：夏尔童·皮埃尔中校，赖巴日·马赛尔中校，布留日·安德烈少校，狄普里莫莱·伯纳德中尉，副官伯雷古瓦·拉乌，狄里昂·雷纳少校，中尉医官韦伯让，副官科帕·奥斯卡，阿里乌·亨利上尉。
