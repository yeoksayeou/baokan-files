    People of All Countries Demand a Successful Geneva Conference
    Oppose US Expansion of the Indochina War
    Vietnam
    People in North Vietnam held rallies to respond to the campaign launched by the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front at its enlarged meeting on April 2, opposing the US interference in the Indochina war of aggression.
    Cadres and model civilian workers who are building roads and bridges in northeastern Vietnam held a rally and passed a resolution stating: We accuse the US imperialists before the people of the world for their shameless interference in the Vietnam war, creating disasters on our territory with aircraft and other weapons. We will smash the imperialists' conspiracy to delay and expand the war of aggression so that our motherland can enjoy true independence and peace.
    At the Third Inter-zone Trade Union Conference held in early April, representatives firmly protested against the US imperialists' intervention in the Indochina war and called on workers in the Third Inter-zone to unite more closely and fight for national independence and freedom and to defend world peace.
    Czechoslovakia
    "Red Right" newspaper published an article by Drozde on the 12th, stating, "According to the agreement reached at the Berlin Four-Power Conference, one of the main tasks of the Geneva Conference is to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." The article pointed out, "However, the current international situation provides numerous evidences that the US ruling clique is trying to preemptively undermine any serious negotiations on this matter." "They want to keep the Korean issue 'permanently unresolved,' apparently in order to enable Washington to exacerbate tensions in Korea and the Far East and to further pursue America's policy of aggression."
    Referring to the United States' repeated provocations and violations of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the article emphasized, "As the Geneva Conference approaches, the United States' blatant provocations are becoming more frequent." The article said that these peace-damaging conspiracies of the United States have encouraged the Syngman Rhee clique, who have been clamoring to boycott the Geneva discussions since the end of the Berlin Conference.
    The article commented on the complete bankruptcy of the plan to hold a so-called "anti-communist conference" in Seoul to express opposition to the Geneva Conference. The article stated, "This clearly proves the great power of the just demands of the people of the Far East who hope for an effective solution to the Korean and Indochinese issues."
    The article concluded: "The US ruling clique and their obedient puppets' conspiracy to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is doomed to failure, because these enemies of peace have not taken into account the invincible power of the freedom-loving people of Asia in their wishful thinking. In the just struggle for freedom, independence, and peace, this power will surely triumph."
    Hungary
    The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "China is a Great Power," saying: "Facts show that China cannot be ignored either in international economics or in international politics. Isn't the fact that Western governments are forced to agree to negotiate with China at the same table in addition to the Soviet Union proof of this? The simple fact that China is participating in the Geneva Conference is a major step forward on the road to respecting China's international status." "The participation of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the camp that advocates negotiation and peaceful consultation, and this victory has opened a new stage in the history of international diplomacy."
    Romania
    A commentary in "Free Romania" pointed out that just as the Soviet Union is doing everything possible to further ease international tensions, the US aggressive bloc is pursuing a policy of inciting war hysteria and conspiring to obstruct the trend towards easing international tensions. On the Indochina issue, the policy of the US aggressive bloc is not to end the war, but to expand it. Dulles' clamor to expand the Indochina war has aroused strong protests from people of all walks of life because the people hope to end the war through the upcoming Geneva Conference. Democratic newspapers and many other newspapers everywhere have denounced the US's plan to undermine the Geneva Conference, and at the same time, they have also denounced the US authorities' hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific. The international aggressive bloc is attempting to intimidate those who are striving to eliminate the danger of a new war. However, the powerful movement launched throughout the world demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction is a clear response from world public opinion to the aggressive bloc. The intimidation policy pursued by the US aggressive bloc is bound to be shamefully defeated because the people of the world oppose this policy and wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to strive for the easing of international tensions.
    India
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India began its meeting in Delhi on the 11th. The meeting passed resolutions on the Indochina issue and condemning US hydrogen bomb tests, exposing the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and calling on the Indian people to unite and fight to smash these conspiracies.
    The resolution on the Indochina issue stated: Eisenhower's and Dulles' recent statements, threatening to carry out "massive retaliation" against Vietnam and China, and attempting to get Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines to jointly issue a warning to China, are a serious threat to peace in Asia. The resolution pointed out that US imperialists are afraid of the prospect of colonial rule being defeated in Indochina, and afraid of the further upsurge of the struggle for freedom throughout Southeast Asia. Therefore, they are frantically attempting to undermine the Geneva Conference. The resolution also stated that the US imperialists have been interfering in the struggle of the Indochinese people, helping and instigating the French colonialists to continue their war to enslave the Indochinese people. They are now falsely claiming that China is interfering in the Indochina war, attempting to use this as an excuse to directly participate in the war and launch a war against China.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India called on the Indian people to unite and launch a powerful movement to smash the US conspiracy and ensure the success of the Geneva Conference so as to end the Indochina war on the basis of the independence of the Indochinese people and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Indochina. The resolution said that the unity of the Indian people and other Asian peoples fighting for freedom and democracy is a powerful factor in smashing this conspiracy of the US warmongers.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India passed a resolution condemning US imperialists for continuing to conduct hydrogen bomb tests in violation of the demands of people all over the world. The resolution stated: It is clear that only the most powerful people's movement can force the US imperialists, who are bent on intensifying international tensions and launching new wars to achieve world hegemony, to agree to the prohibition of these weapons of mass slaughter. The resolution said: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India calls on the Indian people to unite and launch a powerful movement to demand the complete and unconditional prohibition of hydrogen bombs, atomic bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of a supervisory system to oversee the implementation of the ban."

    各国人民要求开好日内瓦会议
    反对美国扩大印度支那的战争
    越南
    北越人民集会响应越南国民联合战线全国委员会在四月二日扩大会议上决定发动的反对美国干预印度支那侵略战争的运动。
    越南东北部修筑公路、桥梁的干部和模范民工举行集会，并通过决议说：我们向全世界人民控诉美帝国主义者无耻地干预越南战争、以飞机和其他武器在我们国土上制造灾难的罪行。我们要粉碎帝国主义者拖延和扩大侵略战争的阴谋，使我们的祖国享受真正的独立与和平。
    在四月初举行的第三联区工会会议上，代表们坚决抗议美帝国主义者干预印度支那战争；并号召第三联区的工人更紧密地团结起来，为争取民族独立和自由及保卫世界和平而斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    “红色权利报”十二日刊载德罗兹德的文章说，“根据柏林四国会议所达成的协议，日内瓦会议的主要任务之一是争取和平解决朝鲜问题。”文章指出，“但是，目前的国际局势提供了无数的证据，证明在这件事情上，美国统治集团正在竭力设法事先破坏任何认真的谈判。”“他们想使朝鲜问题
  ‘永久悬而不决’，显然是为了使华盛顿能够加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势，能够进一步推行美国的侵略政策。”
    文章在谈到美国的多次挑衅和违反朝鲜停战协定的行径时强调说：“随着日内瓦会期的接近，美国的粗暴挑衅越来越频繁了。”文章说，美国这些破坏和平的阴谋鼓励了李承晚集团，他们自从柏林会议结束后，就一直在扬言要抵制日内瓦的讨论。
    文章评论了要在汉城召开所谓“反共会议”来表示反对日内瓦会议的计划的彻底破产，文章说，“这清楚地证明了希望朝鲜和印度支那问题获得有效解决的远东人民的正义要求的伟大力量。”
    文章最后说：“美国统治集团和他们的唯命是听的傀儡阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋是注定要遭到失败的，因为这些和平之敌在他们的如意算盘中没有估计到亚洲爱好自由的人民的不可战胜的力量，在争取自由、独立与和平的正义斗争中，这个力量必然会取得胜利。”
      匈牙利
    匈牙利“自由人民报”以“中国是伟大的强国”为题发表社论说：“事实说明，无论是在国际经济方面或是在国际政治方面都不能忽视中国，西方国家的政府被迫同意除和苏联外并且和中国在一个桌子上进行谈判，这一事实不就是证明了这一点吗？有中国参加的日内瓦会议这一个简单的事实，就是在尊重中国国际地位的道路上推进了一大步。”“中华人民共和国参加日内瓦会议是力主谈判及和平协商的阵营的巨大胜利，这个胜利在国际外交史上开辟了新的阶段。”
      罗马尼亚
    “自由罗马尼亚报”的一篇评论指出，正当苏联在尽一切力量争取国际紧张局势进一步缓和的时候，美国侵略集团却在奉行煽动战争歇斯底里的政策，阴谋阻挠国际紧张局势缓和的趋势。在印度支那问题上，美国侵略集团的政策不是结束这场战争，而是要扩大这场战争。杜勒斯的扩大印度支那战争的叫嚣，引起了各阶层人民强烈的抗议，因为人民希望通过即将举行的日内瓦会议结束这场战争。每个地方的民主报纸和其他许多报纸都斥责美国阴谋破坏日内瓦会议的计划，同时还斥责美国当局在太平洋进行的氢弹试验。国际侵略集团企图恫吓那些在尽力为消除新战争的危险而奋斗的人。但是，全世界所展开的要求禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的强有力的运动，就是世界舆论对侵略集团明白的答复。美国侵略集团进行的恫吓政策一定会遭到可耻的失败，因为全世界人民都反对这种政策，而衷心拥护苏联为争取缓和国际紧张局势所进行的不懈的努力。
      印　度
    印度共产党中央委员会十一日开始在德里举行会议。会议通过了关于印度支那问题和谴责美国举行氢弹试验的决议，揭露美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，号召印度人民团结一致，为粉碎这种阴谋而斗争。
    关于印度支那问题的决议说：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近的声明，扬言要对越南与中国实行“大规模报复”，并想使英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国和菲律宾一起来对中国发出联合警告，这一企图是对亚洲和平的严重威胁。决议指出：美帝国主义者害怕殖民统治在印度支那遭到失败的前途，害怕东南亚各地争取自由的斗争的进一步高涨的前途，于是他们疯狂地企图破坏日内瓦会议。决议又说：美帝国主义者一直在干涉印度支那人民的斗争，一直在帮助并且唆使法国殖民者继续他们的为了奴役印度支那人民而进行的战争，他们现在又硬说中国干涉印度支那战争，企图以此为借口来直接参加这个战争，并向中国发动战争。
    印度共产党中央委员会号召印度人民团结起来，展开一个强大的运动，来粉碎美国的阴谋，保证日内瓦会议的成功，以便在印度支那人民独立和所有外国军队撤出印度支那的基础上结束印度支那战争。决议说：印度人民和其他为自由与民主而斗争的亚洲人民的团结是粉碎美国战争贩子的这种阴谋的强有力的因素。
    印度共产党中央委员会通过决议，谴责美帝国主义者违反全世界人民的要求，继续举行氢弹试验。决议说：很明显，只有最强大的人民运动，才能够迫使一心想加剧国际紧张局势、发动新战争以取得世界霸权的美帝国主义者同意禁止这些大规模屠杀的武器。决议说：“印度共产党中央委员会号召印度人民团结起来，展开一个强大的运动，要求完全无条件地禁止氢弹、原子弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器，建立监督制度来监督禁令的执行。”
