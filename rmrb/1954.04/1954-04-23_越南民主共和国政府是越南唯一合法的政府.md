    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the Only Legitimate Government of Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency Commentator Wu Min
    Asian and world public opinion is condemning the US ruling clique for its large-scale intervention and attempts to expand the Indochina War. To cover up this unjust and evil deed done by the United States, US Secretary of State Dulles and his propaganda machine recently fabricated an argument that the US is "aiding" the "legitimate government" in Vietnam. However, facts show that this argument of Dulles and his ilk is difficult to deceive, especially in the public opinion of Asian countries. For example, the Indian newspaper "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on April 11 saying: Dulles said, "American aid is given to a legitimately established government." "But Dulles's statement cannot hide the fact that although the Communist forces control the Viet Minh (referring to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), the Viet Minh's demand -- liberation from French imperialism -- is a national demand, which is supported by a large part of the Indochinese people."
    In fact, Dulles is on a slippery slope when he talks about a legitimately established government. There is indeed a government legitimately established by the Vietnamese people in Vietnam, but this is by no means the puppet Bao Dai government fostered by the US interventionists and French colonialists, but precisely the target of their war of aggression—the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Historical records are clear and cannot be distorted or falsified.
    During World War II, French colonialists handed Indochina over to Japanese fascists. The Vietnamese people, striving for national independence, launched an unprecedented struggle to resist the Japanese fascist occupation. With the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the Vietnamese people liberated the whole country from the Japanese fascists in 1945 and established the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh, in the name of the Chairman of the Provisional Government of Vietnam, declared the independence of Vietnam and issued the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the realization of the Vietnamese people's century-long desire to decide their own destiny.
    In January 1946, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a National Assembly election. The election was conducted on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage for all citizens, regardless of race, belief, property, or gender. More than 90% of voters in most provinces and cities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participated in the election. In the southern region of Vietnam, the participation rate of voters in most provinces was also above 90%. On March 3, 1946, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, elected by the people, elected the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh was elected as the Chairman of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On November 8, the National Assembly passed the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is such a legitimate government elected by the people. At that time, the French government also recognized this fact. In the preliminary agreement signed with the Vietnamese government on March 6, 1946, the French government recognized that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is a free country with its government, parliament, army, and finance." Later, in the "Temporary Agreement" signed with the Vietnamese government on September 14, the French government affirmed this preliminary agreement. Black and white are written on white paper, which cannot be erased. This also shows that France and Vietnam could have cooperated if it were not for the war imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French colonialists.
    In 1950, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democratic countries successively recognized the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as the legitimate government representing the will of the Vietnamese people. In this way, countries of the democratic socialist camp with a total population of more than 800 million have recognized the independent and autonomous regime chosen by the Vietnamese people themselves.
    Asian public opinion also sympathizes with the struggle of the Vietnamese people led by Ho Chi Minh for national independence, and has always believed that US interventionists and French colonialists are preventing national liberation movements.
    As for the current Bao Dai puppet government, it is a thorough puppet that the United States instructed France to create in 1949. He can only exist with the support of external forces. When Bao Dai made his appearance in June 1949, some bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Western Europe did not shy away from the essence of this lifeless puppet show at that time. The American "Reporter" bi-weekly published an article by Isaacs at the time saying: "The Bao Dai government cannot be said to be an independent country in any way,... In fact, Bao Dai has never had any mass support. ... Ho Chi Minh was, and still is, undoubtedly the leader. ... And the American government wants to reverse this irresistible trend." After five years, even the French bourgeois newspapers admit that this "Bao Dai experiment" has failed. Bao Dai has been spurned by the Vietnamese people. After investigating the opinions of the Vietnamese people in the French-occupied areas, Andre Pide, a member of the French Socialist Party, published an article in the French "People's Daily" a few days ago, saying that the Bao Dai-Bao Loc group does not receive any support from the people, while President Ho Chi Minh is greatly respected and loved by the people and symbolizes the sincere hope of the Vietnamese people.
    Now, in order to try to replace France in Indochina and to seize military command of the Indochina War in order to expand the Indochina War, the United States is coercing France to grant the Bao Dai puppet so-called "complete independence." Bao Dai is also plotting to openly throw himself into the arms of the United States and get rid of France. However, a puppet is still a puppet. Dulles's attempt to portray the Bao Dai puppet as a "legitimate government" to cover up the evil face of American colonialists is futile. The United States supports the Bao Dai puppet, who is despised by the Vietnamese people, and opposes the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is supported by the Vietnamese people. This precisely shows that the United States insists on carrying out the Indochina War in order to seize Indochina from France and take it for itself.

    越南民主共和国政府是越南唯一合法的政府
    新华社评论员　吴敏
    亚洲和世界大部分舆论都在谴责美国统治集团大规模干预并企图扩大印度支那战争。为了掩饰美国所干的这种非正义的罪恶勾当，美国国务卿杜勒斯及其宣传机器最近制造出一种论调，说什么美国在越南是“援助”当地“合法的政府”。但是，事实说明，杜勒斯之流的这种论调是很难发生欺骗作用的，特别是在亚洲各国舆论中。例如，印度报纸“印度斯坦报”在四月十一日发表社论说：杜勒斯说，“美国的援助是给予合法建立的政府的。”“但是杜勒斯的说法不能掩盖这样的事实：尽管共产党势力控制着越盟（指越南民主共和国），但是越盟的要求——从法国帝国主义手中获得解放——是民族的要求，这种要求获得很大一部分印度支那人民的支持。”
    事实上，杜勒斯说到合法建立的政府，就走到必然滑倒的道路上去了。越南的确存在着越南人民合法建立起来的政府，但是这绝不是美国干涉者和法国殖民主义者所一手扶植出来的保大傀儡政府，而正是他们进行侵略战争的对象——越南民主共和国政府。历史的记录清清楚楚，是无法加以歪曲和伪造的。
    在第二次世界大战中，法国殖民主义者把印度支那交给了日本法西斯。争取民族独立的越南人民，展开了空前规模的反抗日本法西斯占领的斗争。随着日本帝国主义的失败，越南人民在一九四五年自日本法西斯手中解放了全国，成立了越南民主共和国临时政府。一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席以越南临时政府主席的名义，宣告越南独立，并发表越南民主共和国独立宣言。越南民主共和国的成立，是越南人民百年来要求自己决定自己命运的意志的实现。
    一九四六年一月，越南民主共和国全国举行了国民大会选举。选举是在全体公民不分种族、信仰、财产、性别而享有普遍、直接和平等的选举权的基础上进行的。越南民主共和国绝大多数省市选民有百分之九十以上参加了选举。越南南部地区，多数省份选民参加选举的也在百分之九十以上。一九四六年三月三日，全国人民选举产生的越南民主共和国国民大会，选出越南民主共和国政府。胡志明当选为越南民主共和国政府主席。十一月八日，国民大会通过越南民主共和国宪法。
    越南民主共和国政府就是这样经过全国人民普选出来的合法政府。当时法国政府也已承认这个事实。法国政府在一九四六年三月六日与越南政府签订的初步协定中，就承认越南民主共和国“是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政”。其后，法国政府在九月十四日与越南政府签订的“临时协定”中，又肯定了这个初步协定。黑字写在白纸上，这是无法抹掉的。这也说明如果不是法国殖民主义者强加于越南人民的这场战争，法国和越南是能够合作的。
    在一九五○年，中华人民共和国、苏联及人民民主国家相继承认越南民主共和国政府是代表越南人民意志的合法政府。这样，已有人口总数达八亿以上的民主社会主义阵营国家承认了越南人民自己所选择的独立自主的政权。
    亚洲各国舆论也同情胡志明领导越南人民所进行的争取民族独立的斗争，并且从来就认为美国干涉者和法国殖民主义者是阻止民族解放运动的。
    至于目前的保大傀儡政府，则是美国指使法国在一九四九年才制造出来的彻头彻尾的傀儡。他只是依靠外来势力的支持才得以存在的。在保大于一九四九年六月粉墨登场时，美国和西欧一些资产阶级报纸当时也不讳言这幕没有生命的傀儡剧的本质。美国“报道者”双周刊当时刊载伊萨克斯的一篇文章说：“保大政府无论如何说不上是独立国家，……事实上，保大从没有任何群众的支持。……胡志明过去是，现在还是无可疑问的领袖。……而美国政府就是想把这种无法抗拒的潮流加以捩转。”经过五年的时间，现在连法国资产阶级报纸也承认这个“保大试验”破产了。保大遭到了越南人民的唾弃。法国社会党党员安德烈·毕德在调查法国侵占区中越南人民的意见回国后，前些日子在法国“人民报”上发表文章说，保大—宝禄集团得不到人民的任何支持，而胡志明主席则是得到人民极大尊敬和爱戴的人，他象征着越南人民的真挚的希望。
    现在，美国为了企图在印度支那取法国的地位而代之，为了夺取印度支那战争的军事指挥权来扩大印度支那战争，正在胁迫法国给予保大傀儡以所谓“全部独立”。保大也在图谋公开投入美国的怀抱，摆脱法国。但是，傀儡毕竟还是傀儡。杜勒斯企图把保大傀儡说成是“合法的政府”来掩饰美国殖民主义者的罪恶面目是徒然的。美国支持遭到越南人民不齿的保大傀儡，而反对越南人民拥护的越南民主共和国，倒正是说明了美国坚持进行印度支那战争就是为了从法国手上夺取印度支那据为己有。
