    Strictly Observe Regulations to Prevent Traffic Accidents
    —Reader Letters Summary
    Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the broad masses of railway workers in our country are diligently learning from the advanced experience of the Sino-Soviet Railway, bringing into play their initiative and creativity in their work, and making great contributions to the completion of transportation tasks and the satisfaction of the needs of national construction and people's lives. However, at present, there are still some serious shortcomings in railway work, and traffic accidents still occur from time to time. Reader Meng Jiting's letter reflects that accidents have been occurring continuously within the jurisdiction of the Manchouli Railway Sub-bureau in Inner Mongolia. Not long after a train derailment occurred at Qishan Station, which belongs to the sub-bureau, in January of this year, a train overturning accident occurred at Nanmu Station. On January 20, a train departing from Boketu Station and running on the Bolin line discovered a broken rail not long after departure; then the locomotive's air pipe was found to be broken. In order to repair the rails and the locomotive, the train had to stop for a long time en route. It can be seen from the readers' letters that similar situations are not uncommon in the railway system. The causes of the accidents are mainly due to the failure of relevant employees to abide by regulations and systems, violations of operational procedures, or violations of labor discipline. For example, more than half of the nine vehicle collision accidents that occurred in the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau in November of last year were caused by employees' violations of operational procedures. Some switch operators, couplers, train inspection inspectors, and caboose preparation personnel read novels, dozed off during working hours, and even drank alcohol before their shifts in violation of regulations. Some leading cadres in some units turn a blind eye to traffic accidents, fail to investigate the causes, learn lessons, and educate employees to improve their work, so that accidents continue to occur. Readers Jiasu and Qianjin write: Zhengjiatun Station had four derailment accidents in a row in one month last year. In mid-December last year, a serious fatal accident occurred due to loading and unloading workers violating operational procedures. In January of this year, there were four more injury accidents. Until recently, accidents are still threatening the safety of train operations; however, they have not yet attracted the attention of the leadership.
    Last year, the Ministry of Railways promulgated the Technical Safety Education Measures and Examination System, and listed the elimination of casualties as a major condition for labor emulation in the railway sector. Many railway bureaus have conducted safety and hygiene inspections and carried out publicity and education, which has achieved certain results. However, because some railway bureaus treat the continuous work of ensuring traffic safety and preventing accidents as a crash program, and have not continued to implement railway regulations and systems on the basis of safety and hygiene inspection work, accidents resurface as soon as the campaign is over. For example, no fatal accidents occurred in the Jinzhou Railway Administration during the safety and hygiene inspections in May, June, and July of last year; however, accidents occurred one after another in August and September as soon as the inspection campaign was over. Three of the five units under the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau lack a regular examination system, and violations of operational procedures occur frequently.
    The above situation shows that the railway department must strengthen the implementation of established regulations and systems, and must regularly conduct ideological education and safety technology and regulations education for the broad masses of employees, so that employees in various positions on the railway transportation line can memorize the regulations and systems of their respective departments, consciously strictly abide by work discipline, and actively prevent the occurrence of accidents. Leading organs at all levels should conduct regular work inspections, and in particular, give play to the role of labor protection committees at all levels to promote the development of mass safety production movements.
    Railway transportation is the country's main means of transportation. The railway department must ensure uninterrupted and accident-free train operation on the basis of safety in order to complete transportation production tasks. If traffic accidents occur continuously, not only will the railway department fail to complete its own tasks, but it will also directly harm the country's industrial construction and national defense construction, and affect the production and life of the broad masses of people. Therefore, strictly abiding by rules and discipline and preventing the occurrence of traffic accidents should become the serious responsibility of all railway employees, especially leading cadres at all levels.

### 严守规章防止行车事故——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    严守规章防止行车事故
    ——读者来信综述
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国广大铁路职工努力学习中长路先进经验，在工作中发挥了积极性和创造性，对完成运输任务，满足国家建设与人民生活的需要作了很大的贡献。但是，目前铁路工作中仍然有着一些严重的缺点，行车事故还时有发生。读者孟继廷来信反映：内蒙古满洲里铁路分局管内最近不断发生事故，该局所属旗山站在今年一月份刚发生火车脱轨事故不久，南木站接着又发生列车颠覆事故。一月二十日，由博克图站始发的在博林线上行驶的列车，出发不久即发现钢轨断裂；继又发现机车风管破裂。为了修复钢轨和机车，列车在途中不得不停留很长时间。从读者来信中看出，类似情况，在铁路系统中是不少的。事故的起因，主要是由于有关员工不遵守规章制度，违章作业或违反劳动纪律。如济南铁路分局在去年十一月份所发生的九件车辆冲突事故中，就有半数以上是职工违章作业所造成。如有些扳道员、连结员、列检检车员、守车整备员等在工作时间看小说、打瞌睡，甚至在当班前违禁饮酒。有些单位的领导干部对发生的行车事故竟然视若无睹，不去追查原因，接受教训，教育职工改进工作，以致事故仍旧连续发生。读者加速、前进来信：郑家屯车站去年曾有一个月接连发生挤岔子事故四次，去年十二月中旬，由于装卸工人违章作业，又发生了一次严重的死亡事故。到了今年一月份，又有四次伤害事故发生。直到最近，事故仍在威胁着行车的安全；可是还没有引起领导方面的注意。
    去年，铁道部曾公布了技术安全教育办法及考试制度，并把消灭伤亡事故列为铁路部门劳动竞赛的一个主要条件。很多路局都曾进行安全卫生大检查，开展宣传教育，收到了一定的效果。但是，因为某些路局把保证行车安全、防止事故这个经常性的工作当作突击工作进行，没有在安全卫生大检查工作的基础上继续坚持贯彻铁路的规章制度，以致运动一过事故又复抬头。如锦州铁路管理局在去年五、六、七月份进行安全卫生大检查时，没有发生过一次死亡事故；可是检查运动刚刚过去，八、九月份事故却又接连出现了。北京铁路分局所属的五个单位，有三个单位缺乏经常的考试制度，违章作业现象也屡有发生。
    上述情况说明：铁路部门必须加强对既定规章制度的贯彻执行，必须对广大职工经常进行思想教育及安全技术、规章制度的教育，让铁路运输线上各个岗位的职工，都能熟记各该部门的规章制度，并能自觉地严守工作纪律，积极防范事故的发生。各级领导机关应经常进行工作检查，特别要发挥各级劳动保护委员会的作用，推动群众性的安全生产运动的开展。
    铁路交通是国家主要的运输工具。铁路部门必须在安全的基础上保证不间断地、无事故地行车，才能完成运输生产任务。如果行车事故不断发生，不仅铁路部门不能完成本身任务，还会直接妨害国家的工业建设和国防建设，影响广大人民的生产与生活。因此，严守规章纪律、防止行车事故的发生，应该成为全体铁路员工，特别是各级领导干部的严重职责。
