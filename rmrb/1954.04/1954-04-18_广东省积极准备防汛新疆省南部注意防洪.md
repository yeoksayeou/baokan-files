Guangdong Province Actively Prepares for Flood Season; Southern Xinjiang Province Pays Attention to Flood Control

    This year, the task of flood prevention in Guangdong Province is to organize the masses to strengthen flood season defense on the basis of spring repair projects. The requirement is to ensure that general dikes do not collapse at ordinary flood levels, and to strive to ensure that they do not collapse even at the highest recorded flood levels. The particularly important main dike on the left bank of the Beijiang River from Shijiao to Sanshui, the Chao'an north and south dikes on the Hanjiang River, and some dikes with stronger flood control capabilities must be guaranteed not to collapse at the highest recorded flood levels. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the prevention of mountain floods and tidal disasters.
    In order to ensure that each enclosure has sufficient flood prevention materials, the Water Conservancy Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government has not only instructed various localities to inspect, count, adjust, and replenish materials before the flood season, but also purchased 36,000 fir piles, focusing on allocating them to various counties. Among them, 13,500 piles are allocated to the main dike on the left bank of the Beijiang River from Shijiao to Sanshui, as second-line materials. This year, the Water Conservancy Department has added 28 flood reporting stations (bringing the total to 127 stations, including last year). The stations on the Xijiang River are scheduled to start reporting floods on April 16, and the flood reporting stations on the other rivers have already started reporting floods on April 1. In addition, water situation forecasts are being piloted at eight stations, including Wuzhou, Gaoyao, Jiujiang, and Shakou on the Xijiang River; Qingyuan and Sanshui on the Beijiang River; Shilong on the Dongjiang River; and Chao'an on the Hanjiang River. This is to strengthen the grasp of flood conditions, improve foresight, and facilitate timely prevention.
    After vigorous reinforcement and consolidation, the dikes along the rivers have been able to withstand ordinary floods. Most areas are now actively carrying out flood prevention work. For example, in Guangning and Sihui counties, leading cadres of the Party and government are personally in charge, organizing a flood prevention and rescue team of more than 10,000 people, and carrying out "three checks" on the dikes—checking the dike body, checking the dike core, and checking the dike height—which has achieved great results.

    There has been a lot of snowfall in the southern Xinjiang Province this winter and spring. This year, the floods in the rivers will not only come earlier but will also be more severe than in previous years. The Southern Xinjiang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this issue and requires all localities to pay attention to doing a good job in flood control. The Southern Xinjiang Water Conservancy Work Team has also made an early spring flood control plan and plans to make full use of floodwater to irrigate farmland.
    Before spring plowing, the special commissioner's offices, the relevant county people's governments, and the water conservancy teams have formed inspection teams to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the Kezi River, Gaizi River, Kusan River, Chakmark River, Buguzi River, Tarim River, Yarkand River, and Tiznap River, from the mountain passes to the river areas. They have proposed plans to reinforce and repair dangerous bridges, sluices, dams, dikes, and riverbanks, and have prepared materials and mobilized laborers for early construction and protection. At the same time, gate openings will be installed at the diversion inlets of qualified canals to control the amount of water entering the canals; flood discharge and sand removal equipment will be established to protect the canals. The masses will also be mobilized to dig drainage dams so that when floods come, the canal water can be diverted to the drainage dams, which can reduce the burden on the canals and allow the drainage dams to store large amounts of water for people and animals, turning water disasters into water conservancy.

    广东省积极准备防汛新疆省南部注意防洪
    今年广东省防汛工作的任务，是要在春修工程基础上组织群众加强汛期防守，要求保证一般堤围在普通洪水位时不溃决，争取在有记录以来最高洪水位时也不溃决；特别重要的北江左岸石角至三水的干堤和韩江的潮安南北堤，以及一部分防洪力量较强的堤围要保证在有记录以来最高洪水位时不溃决。此外，并要加强预防山洪和海潮灾害。
    广东省人民政府水利厅为了使各围有充分的防汛器材，除指示各地在汛前进行检查、清点、调整、添置外，并购置杉桩三万六千根，重点配置在各县，其中拨一万三千五百根配置在北江左岸石角至三水的干堤，作第二线器材。今年水利厅增设了二十八个报汛站（连去年共达一百二十七个站）。西江各站定于四月十六日开始报汛，其余各江报汛站都已在四月一日起开始报汛。此外还在西江的梧州、高要、九江、沙口，北江的清远、三水，东江的石龙，韩江的潮安等八站试行水情预报，加强汛情掌握，提高预见性，以便及时防范。
    各江堤围经过大力培修整理，已能抵御普通洪水。现在大部地区都积极进行防汛工作。如广宁、四会两县由党政负责干部亲自掌握，组织了一支一万多人的防汛抢险队伍，并对堤围进行“三查”——查堤身、查堤心、查堤高，已取得很大成绩。

    新疆省南部地区去冬今春下雪很多，今年各河流的洪水不但来的要早，而且会比往年凶猛。中共南疆区委员会对这问题极为重视，要各地注意做好防洪工作。南疆水利工作队也提前作出春季防洪计划，并计划充分利用洪水灌溉农田。
    春耕前，各专署、各有关县人民政府和水利队已组成检查组，对克孜河、盖孜河、库山河、恰克马克河、布古孜河、塔里木河、叶尔?河及提茨那甫河等，从山口到河区进行一次全面检查，对有危险的桥梁、水闸、大坝、堤防、河岸等，提出加固和补修计划，准备物料，动员民工，及早施工保护。同时并将在有条件的渠道引水口上，安装闸口，控制渠道进水量；建立泄洪及排沙设备，保护渠道。并发动群众，掏挖涝坝，以便洪水来时，将渠水引向涝坝，既可减低渠道负担，又可使涝坝储存大量人畜用水，变水害为水利。
