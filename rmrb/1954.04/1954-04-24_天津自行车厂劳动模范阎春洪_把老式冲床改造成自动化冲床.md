Tianjin Municipal Labor Model Yan Chunhong of the Second Workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory, since successfully creating the first set of automatic molds for punch presses in May 1952, has continuously created more than 20 sets of automatic molds, multi-head molds, and rotary automatic multi-head molds in the past year and more, turning old punch presses into automatic punch presses, greatly improving labor productivity and equipment utilization. Recently, with the help of technicians and workers, he has further improved the internal structure of the punch press molds. This improvement increased the pressure of the punch press, completing the wheel teeth that originally required forty-eight punches in one go, increasing production efficiency by more than tenfold.

One of the important production sections of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, the punch mold section, has more than 400 processes and needs to manufacture more than 90 kinds of parts to supply other sections. However, the machines in this section are all old punch presses. Workers using manual feeding not only wastes time but also frequently causes work-related injuries. Before the successful creation of the first set of automatic molds in 1952, although the production plan for this section was very low, it was very difficult to complete the plan. Many people believed that it was necessary to add new machines. At that time, Yan Chunhong was in the punch mold section's fitter group, specializing in making punch press molds. He felt that the existing punch presses were not insufficient, but that the operating methods were unsafe, there were too many processes, and a lot of man-hours were wasted, which prevented the potential power of the machines from being fully utilized. Therefore, he worked hard to study technology with worker Gao Futong, and with the support of the Party, he finally created the first set of automatic molds in 1952, increasing production efficiency by nearly one time and ensuring the safety of workers' operations. In 1953, according to the opinions of Soviet experts and referring to "Soviet Punch Mold Drawings," Yan Chunhong, together with worker Gao Futong and others, jointly studied and created the first rotary automatic multi-head mold, increasing production efficiency by eight to twelve times. Under the leadership of Yan Chunhong, the workers in the punch mold section further expanded the scope of transforming existing equipment. In a year and a half, the section has adopted more than 60 sets of automatic molds and multi-head molds, increasing the production efficiency of the entire section by more than three times. Now, the utilization rate of each punch press is equal to more than four times that of before. Last year, the punch mold section saved more than 33,000 man-hours and saved materials worth 1.788 billion yuan, reducing the production cost of each bicycle by more than 28,000 yuan.

Yan Chunhong's technical innovation deeds have spread throughout all the factories in Tianjin. Many factory workers are actively studying technology and improving machines and tools. The First Printing and Dyeing Factory organized workers to study Yan Chunhong's innovative spirit and began to thoroughly review past rationalization proposals to promote the development of the technical innovation movement.

    天津自行车厂劳动模范阎春洪
    把老式冲床改造成自动化冲床
    【本报讯】天津市劳动模范、国营天津自行车厂第二车间钳工阎春洪，从一九五二年五月创造第一套冲床自动模具成功后，一年多来已连续创造了二十多套自动模具、多头模具和转盘式自动多头模具，使老式冲床变成了自动冲床，大大提高了劳动生产效率与设备利用率。最近他在技术人员和工人的帮助下，又改进了冲床模具内部的构造。这一改进，加大了冲床的压力，把原来需分作四十八次冲压的轮盘牙，一次冲完，生产效率提高了十倍多。
    天津自行车厂重要生产工段之一——冲模工段有四百多道工序，要制造九十多种零件供应别的工段，但这个工段的机器都是陈旧的冲床，工人用手续料，不但浪费时间，而且经常发生工伤事故。一九五二年第一套自动模具创造成功以前，这个工段的生产计划虽然很低，但要完成计划却很吃力。许多人都认为非增添新机器不可。那时阎春洪在冲模工段钳工组，专做冲床模具，他觉得原有冲床不是不够用，只是因为操作方法不安全，工序太多，浪费许多工时，使机器的潜在力量不能充分发挥。于是，他就和工人高富桐一起努力研究技术，在党的支持下，终于在一九五二年创造了第一套自动模具，生产效率提高近一倍，而且保证了工人操作安全。一九五三年阎春洪根据苏联专家的意见，参考“苏联冲模图样”，和工人高富桐等共同钻研，又创造了第一部转盘式自动多头模具，生产效率提高了八倍到十二倍。在阎春洪的带动下，冲模工段工人进一步扩大了改造现有设备的范围。在一年半的时间内，该工段已采用了六十多套自动模具和多头模具，使全工段的生产效率提高了三倍多，现在平均每部冲床的利用率，等于以前的四部多。冲模工段去年一年节约了三万三千多个工时，并节约材料价值十七亿八千多万元，使每辆自行车的生产成本降低了两万八千多元。
    阎春洪的技术革新事迹，传遍了天津市所有的工厂。许多工厂职工都在积极研究技术，改进机器和工具。第一印染厂组织职工学习阎春洪的革新精神，并开始彻底审查过去的合理化建议，以推动技术革新运动的开展。（附图片）
