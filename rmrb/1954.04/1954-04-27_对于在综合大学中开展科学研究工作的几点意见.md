Some Suggestions on Conducting Scientific Research in Comprehensive Universities
Wu Zhengkai, Head of the Chemistry Department, Fudan University

It can be said that there is no longer any disagreement about the necessity of conducting scientific research in comprehensive universities. However, opinions on certain issues related to carrying out scientific research are not yet consistent. I would like to share some of my personal views.

First, regarding the relationship between scientific research and teaching. Some believe that scientific research is the most important work in universities, while teaching is secondary. Therefore, after hearing the report from the First National Conference of Comprehensive Universities, they hoped to reduce teaching workload as much as possible to dedicate more time to scientific research. Some hold the opposite view, believing that current scientific research must be directly related to teaching, and any research that cannot be directly related to teaching should not be conducted in universities. In my opinion, both views are incorrect. The former excessively emphasizes the importance of research while neglecting that a university is primarily a teaching institution. It is wrong to imagine conducting research without teaching. However, it is also too narrow to understand the integration of research and teaching too simply or mechanically, thinking that so-called integration means limiting research to areas directly serving teaching. Because the research atmosphere in universities is not yet very strong, treating scientific research this way will not benefit its development. Furthermore, I believe that any honest scientific research itself will be combined with practical teaching in a broad sense and can play a role in practice.

Second, regarding what constitutes scientific research. There are also two different views on this issue. One view holds that scientific research is creative work, it must be original, so work such as organizing materials should not be considered research, and therefore has no value. The other view believes that research work has just begun, and requirements cannot be too high, so things like organizing materials, compiling textbooks, and translating and introducing Soviet advanced scientific works can be considered research work. According to the meaning of research work, research work must be original, but today, carrying out research work in universities can only start from a lower level. Moreover, scientific research objects can be simple or complex, and starting with simpler problems is suitable for the current general situation. However, we cannot blur the nature of scientific research just because our scientific research work should progress from the shallow to the deep, and regard non-creative work as research; this is not conducive to cultivating talents with creative work abilities, nor is it conducive to developing creative research work. Of course, it is not right to say that organizing materials has no value just because it is not creative work itself, because any scientific research work cannot be separated from organizing materials.

Third, regarding academic criticism and self-criticism or free discussion in academia. Criticism and self-criticism or free academic debate are of utmost importance in science, which I don’t need to elaborate on. However, at present, the issues of the attitude of criticism and the attitude of accepting criticism have arisen. Many people are afraid to write papers, fearing that they will be criticized: "The more you write, the more mistakes you make; the less you write, the fewer mistakes you make; if you don't write, you don't make mistakes." Some people have become discouraged after being criticized, and even their teaching work has been affected. The existence of this phenomenon is detrimental to the development of scientific research work and the improvement of academic standards. Therefore, it is essential to correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism and establish a climate of free academic debate. Errors in scientific work and reflections of bourgeois ideology in academic thought must be corrected, and this can only be achieved through criticism and self-criticism, so criticism and self-criticism cannot be regarded as optional. However, critics must recognize that these errors and reflections of bourgeois ideology are still unavoidable at present, so they must adopt a "kind" attitude in criticism, rather than a crude and combative approach. On the other hand, those being criticized should recognize that scientific research itself is a pragmatic endeavor, and correcting errors is a crucial key to improving scientific work. If the reasons for criticism are not sufficient or cannot convince oneself, debate is appropriate. Because only through debate can the correct conclusion be found, and only through debate can everyone improve. This is fundamentally different from the previous "mutual disparagement among scholars" and mutual abuse. Only when everyone understands this difference can criticism and self-criticism play a positive role.

Fourth, the difficulties in conducting research work in universities today. There are indeed difficulties in conducting research work in universities today. First of all, although the level of individual scientific workers in our country is not very low, the overall academic community is not very high. Especially young teachers, because our research foundation is still quite weak, they lack self-confidence in research work. Research itself is originally about discovering problems and solving problems. Lacking self-confidence and not daring to try boldly means that problems cannot be discovered, and even if they are discovered, they cannot be solved, which is an obstacle to research work. To solve this problem, senior teachers and scientific workers with research experience should take the lead. They must patiently support the tender sprouts of scientific work in New China, starting with relatively simple research work to cultivate their research abilities, gradually develop their self-confidence, and enable them to gradually become independent combatants on the research front. Secondly, there are difficulties in terms of time and equipment. Since the teaching reform, teachers have spent a lot of time compiling textbooks, which is certainly very important work, but not enough has been done to organize national forces and use collective methods to overcome this difficulty. It is understood that many schools have compiled lectures for the same courses. If organized well, it can not only save manpower but also improve quality. Of course, it was difficult to organize national forces to do this at the beginning of the teaching reform, but today there are conditions. As far as I know, most of the textbooks for the chemistry department can be solved in this way, and it is being gradually resolved. Of course, the difficulties in equipment are also great, but it is still possible to conduct research using existing equipment. First of all, everyone must be able to think of ways and ideas like the volunteer comrades, and not be intimidated by difficulties. Secondly, the existing equipment of various schools and agencies must be fully circulated and basic equipment must be added in a planned way. In my opinion, there is probably still a lot of equipment in our country that has not been fully utilized for various reasons. As long as everyone recognizes the importance of scientific research, these obstacles will not be difficult to overcome. Thirdly, regarding how scientific research work should be linked to practice. After ideological remolding, many teachers have realized that research must be linked to practice, but they therefore feel difficulty in choosing topics. Some people believe that it is more difficult to conduct research work that is linked to actual production in schools, and this idea also hinders the development of scientific research. In fact, this problem is relatively easy to solve. After clearly recognizing the nature and tasks of comprehensive universities, and clearly recognizing that "practice" is not as narrow as originally imagined, this aspect of the problem will naturally be "easily solved."

In short, scientific research work in universities in our country must be carried out at present and can also be carried out. But we must strive to overcome ideological obstacles in this regard, unify various views on research work, in order to do this work well and successfully complete the task of training talents for socialist construction.

    对于在综合大学中开展科学研究工作的几点意见
    复旦大学化学系主任　吴徵铠
    在综合大学里必须开展科学研究工作，这可以说已经没有什么异议。但对开展科学研究工作的某些问题，大家的看法还不是一致的。我现在想谈一点我个人的意见。
    第一、关于科学研究工作和教学工作的关系问题。有人认为，在大学中，科学研究工作是最重要的工作，教学工作则比较次要。因之在听了第一次全国综合大学会议的传达以后，就希望尽可能地减少教学工作来多做科学研究工作。也有些人的看法是相反的，即在他们看来，目前的科学研究工作必须直接结合教学，凡是不能直接结合教学的研究工作就不应该在大学中进行。我以为，这两种看法都是不正确的。因为前一种过分地强调了研究工作的重要，忽视了大学主要是一个教学机构；后一种，则又过分地限制了研究工作的范围。大学中的科学研究工作，是培养专家所必须的一种方法，设想离开教学工作来进行研究工作是不对的。但如果把结合教学进行研究工作理解得太简单，太机械，以为所谓结合教学就只能把研究工作局限在直接为教学服务的范围之内，那也未免过于狭隘。因为在目前大学中的研究空气还不很浓厚，假使这样来对待科学研究工作，对科学研究工作的开展将是毫无益处的。并且我以为，任何诚实的科学研究工作本身，都会和广义的教学实际相结合，也可以在实际中发生作用。
    第二、关于什么才算是科学研究工作的问题。对这一问题也有二种不同的看法。一种认为科学研究是创造性的工作，它必须是创作，所以如材料的整理等工作，都不应算作研究，因而它也是没有价值的。另一种看法则认为，目前研究工作刚开始，要求不能过高，所以像材料整理、教材编写、苏联先进科学论著的翻译介绍都可以算作研究工作。照研究工作的意义讲，研究工作必须是创作，但今天在大学中开展研究工作还只能从较低级的做起。并且科学研究的对象中也有简单的和复杂的，从较简单的问题入手，是适合目前的一般情况的。不过也不能因为我们的科学研究工作要从浅入深，就模糊了科学研究的性质，把不是创造性的工作也算做研究；这样，对我们培养具有创造性工作能力的人才是不利的，对我们开展创造性的研究工作也是不利的。当然，由于整理材料工作本身不是创造性的工作，就说它没有价值，这也不对，因为任何的科学研究工作，都不能离开材料整理工作。
    第三、关于学术上的批评和自我批评或学术中自由讨论的问题。批评和自我批评或学术上的自由争论，在科学中具有极其重要的意义，这不用我再多加说明。但在目前，却发生了批评态度和接受批评态度的问题。有许多人不敢写论文，怕写了被人批评，“多写多错，少写少错，不写不错”。有人因为受了批评而一蹶不振，连教学工作都受了影响。这种现象的存在对科学研究工作的开展，学术水平的提高，都是不利的。因此正确地开展批评和自我批评，树立学术自由争论的风气乃是十分必要的。科学工作中的错误以及学术思想中资产阶级思想的反映都是必须获得纠正的，这只有通过批评和自我批评，所以不能把批评和自我批评视为可有可无。但批评者必须认识到目前这些错误和资产阶级思想的反映还是不能避免的，所以在批评中就必须采取“与人为善”的态度，而不应采用粗暴的打击方式，这是一方面。另一方面，被批评者则应认识到科学研究的本身是实事求是的工作，错误得到纠正是科学工作得以提高的重要关键，如果批评的理由不充分、不能说服自己时，争辩是应该的。因为只有争辩，才能找到正确的结论，也只有通过争辩，大家才能获得提高。这和以前的“文人相轻”，互相谩骂，有着本质上的区别。只有大家体会到这个区别时，批评和自我批评才能起积极作用。
    第四、今天在大学里开展研究工作的困难问题。在今天大学里开展研究工作不是没有困难的。首先我国个别的科学工作者的水平虽然并不很低，但就整个学术界说来，还不是很高的。特别是年轻教师，由于我们的研究工作基础还相当薄弱，所以他们在研究工作上也就缺少自信心。研究本身原是发现问题和解决问题，缺少自信心，不敢大胆尝试，问题就不能发现，发现了也不能解决，这对研究工作是一种阻力。这个问题的解决，老教师和具有研究经验的科学工作者是应该首先负起责任的。他们必须很耐心地来扶植新中国科学工作的嫩芽，开始要用较简单的研究工作来培养他们的研究能力，逐步养成他们的自信心，使他们逐步能变成研究战线上的独立作战的战士。其次，时间和设备的困难。自从教学改革以来，教师们在编译教材方面所用去的时间是很多的，这固然是非常重要的工作，但组织全国力量和用集体办法来克服这种困难却做得不够。据了解，不少学校都各为同一课程编了讲义，如果组织得好，不但可以节省人力，而且质量也可以提高。当然在教学改革初期就组织全国力量来作这件事情是有困难的，但在今天已经有条件了。就我所知，化学系的各种教材大部分都可以用这种办法来解决，而且已在逐步解决。设备方面的困难当然也很大，但利用现有设备来进行研究，还是可以的。这首先要大家都能像志愿军同志那样的想办法、出主意，不被困难吓倒。其次，则必须充分流通各校各机关的现有设备和有计划地添置基本设备。在我看来，我国现有设备因为各种原因而未能充分利用的恐怕还是不少，只要大家都认识了科学研究的重要性，这些障碍就不难克服了。再次，关于科学研究工作如何联系实际的问题。在思想改造后，不少教师已认识到研究必须联系实际，但却因此在选择题材上感到困难。有人认为，联系生产实际来进行研究工作，在学校中是比较困难的，这思想也阻碍了科学研究的开展。其实，这一问题事实上是比较容易解决的，在明确认识了综合大学的性质和任务之后，明确认识了“实际”不是如原来所想像的那样狭隘，这方面的问题当然也就“迎刃而解”了。
    总之，我国大学中的科学研究工作，在目前是必须开展而且也是可以开展的。但我们必须努力克服这方面的思想障碍，统一对研究工作的各种看法，才能把这项工作作好，顺利地完成为社会主义建设培养人才的任务。
