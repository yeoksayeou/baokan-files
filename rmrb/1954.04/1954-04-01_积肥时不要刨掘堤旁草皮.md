    Do Not Dig Up Sod Near Dikes When Accumulating Fertilizer
    Chen Haifu of the Forestry Work Team of Shaoyang Special District, Hunan Province writes: In order to increase production and support national industrial construction, the peasants in the Shaoyang area are actively looking for fertilizer sources and carrying out fertilizer accumulation work. However, in some places, peasants have dug up all the sod on both sides of river dikes when accumulating fertilizer. This has happened in Pingqing Township, District One, Dongkou County. Of course, it is possible to use sod as fertilizer, but it should be clear which areas of sod can be dug up and which areas cannot. The sod on the dikes plays a great role in protecting the dike body. If it is dug up, it will affect the consolidation of the dike body, and there will be a risk of dike collapse when the river water rises. Therefore, I suggest that the leading departments in various places pay attention to this issue and educate the peasants not to dig up the sod on both sides of river dikes when accumulating fertilizer.

### 积肥时不要刨掘堤旁草皮

    积肥时不要刨掘堤旁草皮
    湖南邵阳专署林业工作队陈海福来信：邵阳地区的农民为了增加生产，支援国家工业建设，正积极寻找肥源，开展积肥工作。但是有些地方的农民在积肥时把河堤两旁的草皮也刨干净了。洞口县一区平清乡就发生了这种情况。当然，刨草皮作肥料是可以的，但应分清什么地方的草皮可刨，什么地方的草皮不可刨。堤岸上的草皮，对保护堤身起很大的作用，如果刨掉了会影响堤身的巩固，当河水上涨时就有溃堤的危险。因此，我建议各地领导部门注意这个问题，教育农民在积肥时，不要把河堤两旁的草皮刨去。
