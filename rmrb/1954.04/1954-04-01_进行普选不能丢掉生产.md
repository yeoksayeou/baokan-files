    Conducting the General Election Must Not Abandon Production
    Xi Boying, Hebei Funing County Agricultural Technology Extension Station writes: After our station received the directive from the North China Administrative Committee in mid-February regarding vigorously preparing for spring plowing, we immediately took action. In the mountainous areas, we selected key areas to conduct technical demonstrations and disseminate knowledge on fruit tree scraping, pruning, and pest control; in the plains areas, we mobilized farmers to accumulate fertilizer, select seeds, inspect wheat fields, and preserve and test soil moisture; the staff remaining in the office worked on seed identification, germination tests, and taught pesticide application methods to the supply and marketing cooperative personnel who distribute pesticides. We had reported this work arrangement to the higher authorities. However, just as our work was proceeding intensively, the county transferred all our comrades working in rural areas back to participate in the three-level expanded cadre meeting, and after the meeting, decided that all fourteen people in our station, except for one person left in the office, would go to the countryside to participate in the general election work. When assigning tasks, the leadership comrades did not take into account the principle of combining general election work with production work. For example, Gao Ruizhen, a staff member of our station, was originally approved by the county leadership to engage in fine cotton breeding work in Xiazhuang Township, but was assigned to Cao Dongzhuang Township for the general election; Liu Shiru originally managed fruit tree pruning and scraping in the Zhao Gezhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shicaoyu Township, but was assigned to Pingfangdian Township instead. We raised our opinions five times, but the leadership replied, "Anyway, you can't do your professional work during the general election, wait until the general election is over." Currently, fruit trees urgently need pruning and pest control, spring wheat is about to be sown, cotton seeds need to be mobilized for seed selection, and potato seeds stored in cellars need to be inspected and farmers need to be mobilized to change beds and soil, seed soaking techniques need to be taught, and wheat fields need to be inspected and managed, but most of these tasks cannot be carried out according to plan. I believe that the leadership of our county is wrong in this practice of only focusing on the general election and disregarding production.

    进行普选不能丢掉生产
    河北抚宁县农业技术推广站奚伯英来信：我站在二月中旬接到华北行政委员会关于大力作好春耕准备工作的指示后，就立即行动起来。在山区选择了重点地区进行果树刮皮、剪枝除虫等技术示范和传授推广工作；在平原地区发动农民积肥、选种、检查麦田、保墒验墒；留在机关的工作人员，作种籽鉴定、发芽试验，并向供销合作社经售农药的人员传授农药使用法等。这样的工作安排，我们曾向上级汇报过。但是，当我们的工作正紧张进行的时候，县里把我站在农村工作的同志全部调回参加三级扩大干部会议，会后并决定我站除留一人在机关外，其余十四人全部下乡参加普选工作。在分配任务时，领导同志又毫不照顾普选工作应和生产工作相结合的原则。如我们站工作人员高瑞珍原来经县领导批准在下庄乡搞良棉繁殖工作，这次却被分配到曹东庄乡搞普选；刘士儒原在石槽峪乡掌握赵各庄农业生产合作社果树修剪、刮皮等工作，结果却被分配到平房店乡去了。我们曾五次提出意见；但领导方面却回答说：“反正普选的时候你们也不能搞本职工作，等普选工作完了再说。”当前果树急需修剪除虫，春小麦就要开始播种，棉籽需要发动群众粒选，井窖贮藏的种薯需要检查和发动农民换床换土，浸种技术要传授，麦田需要检查与管理，但这些工作绝大部分是不能按照计划进行了。我认为我县领导方面这种只顾普选、不顾生产的作法是不对的。
