    Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Letter of Congratulations to All Representatives of the Gaoxiao Graduate Representative Conference in Ding County

    To all representatives of the Gaoxiao Graduate Representative Conference in Ding County:

    I was very happy to hear about your meeting. I congratulate you on the victory and success of your meeting.

    Gaoxiao graduates—people who already possess a basic level of education—have become an important force in our cooperative. Our agricultural production cooperative has expanded from 287 households last year to 395 households now. As our cause develops, the work we need to do increases. Our cooperative needs to gradually transition to a completely socialist nature, and we need to increase the number of accountants, technicians, tractor drivers, and cadres in various fields. These people need a certain level of cultural knowledge, so Gaoxiao graduates have become an indispensable force in our cooperative. Currently, the cooperative has 34 Gaoxiao graduates. Five have been sent to the tractor station to learn how to drive tractors, two are working as accountants, two as agricultural technicians, two are learning to dig wells, and one is serving as the deputy director of the cooperative. To develop health care work, we sent Gaoxiao graduate Qiao Lingyun to the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Station to study. Others are working as work recorders, civil school teachers, women's production team leaders, and so on. Each person is a valuable asset to our cooperative. To help them learn well, we will enroll 20 young men and women to establish an amateur technical school, helping them to systematically and planfully study tractor driving, agricultural water conservancy, and other knowledge, and cultivate them into talents for national construction.

    Next year, our cooperative will have its own tractor drivers plowing the land, as well as our own agricultural technology extension workers, well-digging technicians, and health care workers, all of whom are our Gaoxiao graduates. In the past, some Gaoxiao graduates in our cooperative were not content with agricultural production. They did not see the future of rural development and did not understand the importance of their participation in production. After participating in various tasks in the cooperative, they saw the future and the vision of socialism. In their actual work, they also felt the importance of their responsibility to build a new countryside and felt very honored. Therefore, they all love their work and are content with their work. For example, the five young people learning to drive tractors are following the tractors all day long, rain or shine. Two young women are already able to drive tractors on the land. Wei Shujuan, who serves as an accountant, sometimes studies with the cooperative's chief accountant until midnight, delving into her business. She used to often misremember accounting subjects, but now she remembers all 24 accounting subjects correctly. Li Yunmang, who serves as a technician, has now also learned sweet potato seedling cultivation and techniques such as corn and millet germination rate testing and seed soaking. Other Gaoxiao graduates are also actively learning and working in the cooperative.

    You have already graduated from Gaoxiao, and some are about to graduate. The country is calling you, and the countryside is welcoming you. I also hope that you can join the agricultural production team. You will surely be like those Gaoxiao graduates here, actively learning and contributing your strength to the construction of our beloved motherland and beautiful hometown. Our ancestors used hard work to open up vast and fertile land for us; the previous generation used blood and sweat to exchange for our happiness and clear the obstacles on the road ahead. The remaining construction has become the main responsibility of the youth. The responsibility of rural Gaoxiao graduates is significant. I hope you will actively participate in agricultural production, so that good crops can grow on our land, providing the country with a large amount of grain and industrial raw materials. Our countryside will use a large number of tractors, our socialist society will arrive soon, and we will be able to live a fulfilling and happy life like the Soviet people today. I hope that under the leadership of the Party and the League, you will study hard and exert greater strength in rural work.

    I wish you good health and bravely take up the posts needed by the motherland.

    耿长锁农业生产合作社
    给定县高小毕业生代表会议全体代表的贺信定县高小毕业生代表会议的全体代表们：
    我听到你们开会的消息后，心里很高兴。我祝贺你们的会议胜利和成功。
    高小毕业生——这已具备了基础教育水平的人们，在我们社里来说，已经成了一支重要的力量。我们的农业生产合作社，已由去年的二百八十七户扩大到现在的三百九十五户了。我们的事业发展了，需要做的工作就更加增多。我们的合作社要逐步地过渡到完全社会主义性质的，还需要增加许多会计、技术员、拖拉机手和各方面的干部，这些人需要有一定的文化知识，所以高小毕业生已成了我们社不可缺少的力量。现在全社已有了三十四个高小毕业生，有五个被送到拖拉机站学开拖拉机，有两个当了会计，两个当了农业技术员，两个学打洋井，一个当了副社长。为开展卫生保健工作，我们把高小毕业生乔苓云送到省妇幼保健站去学习。别的有的当了记工员、民校教员、妇女生产队长等。每个人都是我们社里的宝贵财产。为使他们学的好，我们将要吸收二十名青年男女成立业余技术学校，帮助他们有系统、有计划地学习开拖拉机、农业水利等知识，培养他们成为国家建设人材。
    明年，我们社将会有自己的拖拉机手，在大地上耕作，将会有自己的农业技术推广员、打井技术员和卫生保健员，这些都是我们的高小毕业生。以前我们社里的高小毕业生，有些也是不安心农业生产的，没看到农村发展的前途，不了解自己参加生产的重要。他们参加了社里的各项工作以后，看见前途了，看见了社会主义的远景。在实际工作中，他们也感到自己建设新农村责任的重大，觉得很光荣，所以他们都热爱自己的工作，安心自己的工作。如学开拖拉机的五个青年，整天风里雨里地跟着拖拉机转，有两个青年妇女已经能开着拖拉机在地上跑了。担任会计的魏淑娟，有时跟社的总会计学习到半夜，钻研自己的业务，从前常记错会计科目，现在二十四种会计科目都记不错了。担任技术员的李云忙，现在也学会了甘薯育苗，玉米、谷子试验发芽率和浸种等技术。其他高小毕业生也是一样，在社里积极学习和工作着。
    你们已经高小毕业了，有的就要毕业。国家正在号召你们，农村正在欢迎你们，我也希望你们能参加到农业生产队伍中来。你们也一定会像我们这里那些高小毕业生们一样，积极地学习，为建设可爱的祖国和美好的家乡贡献自己的力量。我们的祖先用辛勤的劳动，为我们开辟了广大肥沃的土地；前一代的人们，又用血汗为我们换来了幸福，扫清了前进道路上的障碍；剩下的建设，就成了青年们的主要责任。农村高小毕业生的责任是重大的。希望你们积极参加农业生产，使咱们的土地上长出好庄稼来，供给国家大批的粮食和工业原料，我们农村就会使上大批拖拉机，我们的社会主义社会就会早日到来，就能过上像苏联人民今天那样的美满、幸福的生活。望你们在党和团的领导下努力学习，在农村工作上发挥更大的力量。
    祝你们身体健康，勇敢地走上祖国需要的岗位。
