Xinhua News Agency report:

    Spring afforestation is vigorously underway in mountainous and suitable areas across the country. In the Minjiang River basin of Fujian Province, the Huangshan mountainous area of Anhui Province, and southwestern Zhejiang Province, farmers are cultivating large quantities of high-quality timber forests for construction. Barren mountains near various mining areas and both banks of major rivers in Shandong Province are being used to cultivate timber forests for mine props. In the upstream areas of many reservoirs in the Dabie Mountains of Anhui Province, along the Puyang River, Dongtiao Creek, and Xitiao Creek in Zhejiang Province, and in the four mountainous areas of Yishan, Mengshan, Lushan, and Taishan in Shandong Province, water conservation forests are being continuously cultivated in conjunction with hillside closure for forest cultivation and soil and water conservation. By March 10th, Taian Prefecture in Shandong Province had afforested more than 6,000 mu. Farmers in the mountainous areas of Tianmu, Yandang, and Tiantai in Zhejiang Province, under the slogan of "Planting one more tree is contributing one more share of strength to the country's socialist construction," are carrying fir strips and pine seedlings to the mountains for planting. In the Central South region, farmers in the mountainous areas of Hunan Province plan to plant more than 1.1 million mu of timber forests such as fir and pine this spring. According to incomplete statistics from Xiangnan Administrative Region and Xiangtan and Shaoyang Prefectures in late March alone, approximately 500 million seedlings have been planted, with an afforestation area of more than 600,000 mu. The Southwest region plans to cultivate 2.4 million mu of timber forests this year. Farmers in the nine counties surrounding the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan Province are focusing on cultivating fir forests in the Qionglai Mountains. Counties in the Fujiang River basin and areas south of the Yangtze River are also focusing on afforestation to prevent soil erosion from mountain floods.
    Spring afforestation is now beginning in northern areas where spring arrives later. In the North China region, Shanxi Province began spring afforestation universally before the Qingming Festival. Currently, farmers in mountainous areas such as the Taihang and Lüliang Mountains, along the Yongding River, Fen River, and Changyuan River, and along the Tongpu Railway are actively afforesting. The village forests cultivated by the four counties of Jie, Wenxi, etc., total 4,057 mu, with more than 500,000 trees planted. The famous Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative planted 30,000 locust trees in three days by all its members. In the Northwest region, Gansu Province will cultivate windbreak and sand-fixation forests in the Jiuquan and Wuwei Prefectures of the Hexi Corridor this year to protect farmland; cultivate water conservation forests in the Longdong area and parts of Tianshui in the upper reaches of the Jing River and Wei River to prevent large-scale soil erosion; and vigorously cultivate timber forests and economic forests in Longnan and Longzhong.

    春季造林在各地山区和宜林地带火热进行
  据新华社讯：春季造林正在各地山区和宜林地带火热地进行。华东区福建省的闽江流域，安徽省的黄山山区，以及浙江省西南部的农民，正在营造大批优良的建筑用材林。山东省各个矿区附近的荒山和大河两岸正在营造矿柱用材林。安徽省大别山区许多水库的上游，浙江省浦阳江和东苕溪、西苕溪两岸，以及山东省沂山、蒙山、鲁山、泰山四个山区，都结合封山育林和水土保持继续营造水源林。到三月十日止，山东省泰安专区已造林六千多亩。浙江省天目、雁荡、天台等山区的农民，在“多种一棵树，就是为国家的社会主义建设多尽一分力量”的口号下，纷纷携带杉条、松苗等上山种植。中南区湖南省山区农民，计划在今年春天栽植杉、松等用材林一百一十多万亩。仅据湘南行政区和湘潭、邵阳两专区在三月下旬的不完全统计，已栽植苗木约五亿株，造林面积达六十多万亩。西南区今年计划营造用材林二百四十万亩。四川省环绕着成都平原周围九个县的农民；在邛崃山脉一带，重点营造杉木林。涪江流域各县和长江以南地区也在重点造林，以防止山洪对土壤的冲刷。
    春天来临较晚的北方各地，现在也开始春季造林。华北区山西省在清明节前便普遍进行春季造林。目前太行山和吕梁山等山区，永定河、汾河、昌源河等河之滨以及同蒲铁路沿线等地农民，都在积极造林。解县、闻喜等四县营造的村有林达四千零五十七亩，植树五十多万株。著名的李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，全体社员三天内就植洋槐树三万株。西北区甘肃省今年将要在河西走廊的酒泉、武威两专区营造防风、防沙林以保护农田；在泾河、渭河上游陇东地区和天水部分地区营造水源林，以防止水土的大量流失；在陇南和陇中一带大力营造用材林和经济林。
