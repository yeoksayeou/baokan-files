    The world's attention is focused on the developing military situation in Indochina.

    Recent battle reports over the past three months indicate that with the intensified interference by American war-mongers and the continued implementation of the "Navarre Military Plan," the French invaders in Indochina are facing increasingly fierce counterattacks and suffering increasingly severe defeats.

    I. Starting with the Geographical Situation of Indochina

    Looking at a world map, one can see the strategic position of Indochina.

    The northern part of Indochina shares a several-hundred-kilometer-long border with China, and the western part is adjacent to Burma and Thailand. It firmly wedges between the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are distributed across this dumbbell-shaped area. Vietnam occupies an important position. Its territory extends from north to south along the more than two thousand kilometers of coastline on the eastern side of the Indochina Peninsula. Obviously, to invade Indochina, one must first occupy the Mekong River Delta in southern Vietnam and the Red River Delta in the north; at the same time, it is necessary to control the narrow central part of Vietnam, because it has an excellent naval port in Da Nang in the east and a plateau overlooking northeastern Cambodia and connected to central and southern Laos (commonly known as the Central Highlands) in the west. Conversely, to control Vietnam, one must occupy Cambodia and Laos, especially central and southern Laos, because it is connected to the narrow waist of Vietnam. More than eighty years ago, French colonists followed this route to conquer the entire Indochina and from there to encroach upon Guangxi and Yunnan in China. After World War II, in the autumn of 1945, French colonists once again invaded Indochina along this route. The difference is that this time it was carried out with the support of British imperialists, especially with the intervention of American imperialists later on. However, due to the united and heroic resistance of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, French colonists have not only failed to re-establish their rule over Indochina but have also suffered significant losses in the long war.

    In order to invade Indochina and use it as a military base to attack China, American war-mongers are, on the one hand, urging French colonists to continue fighting, and on the other hand, stepping up the injection of economic and military power into this war of aggression. This is the crux of why the Indochina War cannot be ended quickly and continues to be prolonged and expanded.

    II. The "Navarre Military Plan" is Disrupted

    Since the summer of 1953, French and American imperialists have been vigorously promoting the so-called "Navarre Military Plan." This military plan, named after the seventh French invading army commander-in-chief Navarre and aimed at continuing and expanding the Indochina war of aggression, was formulated with the direct participation of the American military authorities.

    According to the "Navarre Military Plan," American military supplies and military personnel were continuously shipped to Indochina, and ten French invading army battalions were also transferred to Indochina from North Africa and Korea. At the same time, French and American imperialists ordered puppet governments such as Bao Dai to extensively search for young people in Indochina to expand the puppet army.

    Navarre criticized his predecessor, the French invading army commander-in-chief Salan, believing that Salan's biggest miscalculation was excessively dispersing his forces, resulting in two major failures: the failure in the Son La area of ​​northwestern Vietnam in the winter of 1952, and the failure in the Sam Neua area of ​​Upper Laos in the spring of 1953. Navarre advocated concentrating mobile forces and making full use of paratroopers and commandos to "pacify" the rear of the occupied areas and attack and invade the liberated areas to gain "military initiative."

    On the surface, Navarre seems to be one step ahead of Salan; but in reality, Navarre is no better than his predecessor, and even worse. Because the nature of the war has determined a contradiction that the invaders cannot resolve: that is, to have land or to have people? Dividing the troops to occupy land carries the risk of being defeated one by one; concentrating the troops means losing many places, and eventually losing both people and land.

    When Navarre took office with the support of the American Pentagon, he was smugly implementing this plan to reverse the entire war trend. Now, more than ten months have passed, and Navarre has not only failed to "reverse" the war trend, but has instead left behind many defeats. Especially in the past three months, this commander-in-chief of the invading army has suffered defeat after defeat in the widespread winter-spring campaign launched by the people's armed forces of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Initially, US Secretary of State Dulles pretended to be calm and said that the situation in Indochina "will not have a major timetable to disrupt the Navarre plan." But later, Navarre's American masters became increasingly impatient, and many people on Wall Street were clamoring to "adjust" Navarre's military plan.

    III. Three Months of Winter and Spring

    The past three months of last winter and this spring were the days when Navarre suffered the most severe failures since taking office.

    Starting in December last year, the Vietnam People's Army heavily hammered the French invading army first in North Vietnam and then in Central Vietnam. The soldiers and civilians on other battlefields in Vietnam also actively cooperated, effectively supporting the operations on the main battlefield; at the same time, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, who have forged a solid friendship in their joint struggle, also cooperated in combat in order to thwart the conspiracy of French and American imperialists to continue and expand the Indochina war of aggression. In various battlefields in Vietnam and Laos, the winter-spring campaign was launched extensively starting in mid-December last year.

    This large-scale campaign first unfolded in the Lai Chau area of ​​northwestern Vietnam. At that time, Navarre had just air-dropped about four mobile battalions to Dien Bien Phu on the border between Vietnam and Laos in order to echo the invading army trapped in Lai Chau, an important town in northwestern Vietnam, and to control Upper Laos and re-invade the liberated area of ​​northwestern Vietnam. However, the heroic and skilled Vietnam People's Army liberated Lai Chau within half a month, leaving the invading army in Dien Bien Phu isolated and helpless.

    Just as the Vietnam People's Army was winning in Lai Chau, forcing Navarre to invest one-fifth of Indochina's mobile forces in Dien Bien Phu, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on both sides of Highway 12 in central Laos, annihilating nearly three infantry battalions and two artillery companies of the invading army in three days, and at one point occupying Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province. Immediately afterwards, the Lao People's Liberation Army penetrated southward, cutting off Highway 9, the strategic transportation line connecting the central Laotian town of Savannakhet to central Vietnam, and annihilating nearly one battalion of the invading army.

    In order to cooperate with the operations in North Vietnam and the advance of the Lao People's Liberation Army in central Laos, the Vietnam People's Army launched an offensive in the Central Highlands (Tay Nguyen) area starting on January 26th, and within half a month liberated Kontum, the capital of Tay Nguyen Province, and most of the province, and controlled Highway 14, the strategic transportation line from Da Nang in central Vietnam to Saigon, the central city of South Vietnam. On February 18th, the Vietnam People's Army took advantage of its victory to attack the Duc To outpost southeast of Kontum, annihilating most of a company of the French invading army that had just been transferred from Korea. On January 31st, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the Bolaven Plateau in Lower Laos, which connects to the Central Highlands. The offensive developed very rapidly, and on February 1st it liberated Attapeu and successively captured most of the Bolaven Plateau. While launching an offensive in Lower Laos, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in the Nam Ou River basin in Upper Laos. From January 31st to February 3rd, it annihilated and routed about sixteen companies of the French invading army; in the second half of February, it swung its troops northward, attacked Phongsali Province, and liberated the provincial capital and most of the province. Phongsali Province is located at the northernmost tip of Indochina and occupies a relatively important strategic position. When the Japanese fascists occupied Indochina in March 1945, the French invading army escaped to Yunnan, China, through there; after Japan surrendered in August, the French invading army used it as a springboard to re-occupy Lai Chau, Son La, and other provinces in northwestern Vietnam. The offensive of the Lao People's Liberation Army in the Nam Ou River basin, and its subsequent liberation of Phongsali Province, strongly supported the encirclement of the French invading army airdropped in Dien Bien Phu by the Vietnam People's Army.

    A series of offensives launched by the Vietnam People's Army and the Lao People's Liberation Army greatly shocked the French and American imperialists, forcing Navarre to disperse the mobile forces he had just concentrated to various critical battlefields; but when Navarre withdrew troops from North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and Cambodia, the occupied areas of the French invading army, especially the rear of the occupied areas—from the Mekong River Delta in the south to the Red River Delta in the north—were under the threat of the Vietnamese people's armed forces. Vietnamese soldiers and civilians could freely come and go in these areas at any time, attacking and destroying the strongholds, ammunition depots, airports, trains, and boats of the French invading army, and effectively cooperating in combat. The only way for Navarre to support the troops fighting on remote front lines was to rely on air transport, but this air transport line was also difficult to maintain. Because air force bases distributed in various places are not so safe. The Muong Sai Airport in Upper Laos is often bombarded by artillery fire, and the airports in the Red River Delta are constantly attacked. In early March, the Vietnam People's Army attacked Gia Lam and Cat Bi airports near Hanoi and Haiphong on March 4th and 6th, destroying as many as 78 aircraft on the spot. This was the first time since the war that the French Air Force had suffered such serious losses. On land, the occupied areas of the French invading army in North Vietnam, Central Vietnam, and South Vietnam were not only shrinking day by day, but also becoming increasingly unstable. Even the heartland of the French invading army was not very stable. Highway 5, the important transportation line of the French invading army from Haiphong to Hanoi, and the railway parallel to the highway were cut off again and again, many important strongholds were captured one after another, and the few remaining mobile forces and garrison troops were weakening day by day.

    At the same time, the Cambodian people's armed forces are also actively engaged, strongly supporting the offensives of the Vietnam People's Army and the Lao People's Liberation Army.

    IV. The Awkward Situation of the French Invaders

    The winter-spring campaign launched by the people's armies of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos reached its first peak in mid-March. The Vietnam People's Army, which besieged Dien Bien Phu, began to attack the group stronghold of the French invading army on the afternoon of March 13th. This offensive was unprecedentedly fierce in the Indochina War. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Vietnam People's Army successively broke through the two strongest resistance centers of the invading army's Dien Bien Phu group stronghold—Him Lam and Doc Lap—and completely annihilated two battalions of the French invading army's elite troops; immediately afterwards, the Vietnam People's Army captured the Ban Keo stronghold, forcing two companies of Thai puppet troops to surrender. In its first attack, the Vietnam People's Army quickly destroyed the entire northern defense line of Dien Bien Phu, placing the central area of ​​the invading army group stronghold under its direct threat.

    In the first battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French invading army suffered a crushing defeat, and the myth of the "steel fortress" was exposed. After this crushing defeat, the French invading army began to reinforce its fortifications and was forced to transfer two or three more mobile battalions from the tense Red River Delta and Central Laos to Dien Bien Phu.

    However, just over half a month later, the Vietnam People's Army launched another offensive against the Dien Bien Phu group stronghold. From March 30th to April 2nd, in these four days, it quickly destroyed most of the eastern defense line of Dien Bien Phu, directly threatening the command headquarters and airport of the French invading army in Dien Bien Phu; the western defense line of Dien Bien Phu was also broken through at the same time, where it gained a foothold and forced two companies of Thai puppet troops to surrender. In just these four days of fighting, the defenders of Dien Bien Phu were annihilated by another battalion and nine companies. After two operations, the Vietnam People's Army had approached the center of the Dien Bien Phu group stronghold—Muong Thanh—from the north, east, and west directions.

    Dien Bien Phu has become a big burden for the French invading army. The French invading army carried this big burden at the instigation of American war-mongers. But since Navarre shouldered this big burden, in the past three months, he has suffered a series of failures, and each failure has been more disastrous than the last.

    法国侵略者的尴尬处境
    新华社记者　展潮
    举世瞩目的印度支那军事形势，目前还在发展中。
    最近三个多月来的战况表明：随着美国战争贩子的加紧干涉，随着“纳瓦尔军事计划”的继续推行，法国侵略者在印度支那所遭到的反击愈来愈猛烈，所遭受的失败也愈来愈惨重。
    一、从印度支那地理形势谈起
    翻开世界地图，就可以看到印度支那在战略上的地位了。
    印度支那的北部和中国有着几百公里长的共同边界，西部和缅甸、泰国相毗邻。它坚实地楔在中国的南海和暹罗湾之间。越南、高棉和寮国三个国家分布在这个仿佛哑铃形状的地带上面。越南占居着重要的位置。它的国土沿着印度支那半岛东部两千多公里漫长的海岸线自北向南延伸。很明显，要进攻印度支那，就必须首先占领越南南部的湄公河三角洲和北部的红河三角洲；同时还要控制越南狭长的中部，因为这里东面有优良的军港——岘港、西面有俯视高棉东北并和寮国中南部相连贯的高原
  （通称西原）。反过来，要控制越南，就必须占领高棉和寮国，尤其是寮国的中南部，因为这里正和越南狭长的腰部相连。法国殖民者在八十多年前就是沿着这条路线攻占整个印度支那的，并由此而进窥中国的广西和云南。第二次世界大战后，一九四五年秋天，法国殖民者又重新沿着这条路线侵略印度支那。所不同的，这次是在英帝国主义者的支持下，特别是以后美帝国主义者的干预下进行的。但是由于越南、高棉和寮国三国人民团结一致、英勇的抗击，法国殖民者不仅没有办法再度统治印度支那，而且在长期的战争中遭到了大量的损耗。
    为了侵略印度支那，并踞此以作为进攻中国的军事基地，美国的战争贩子正一面督促法国殖民者继续作战，另一面则加紧把经济和军事力量投到这个侵略战争上来。这就是印度支那战争之所以不能早日结束、并继续延长和扩大着的症结所在。
    二、“纳瓦尔军事计划”被打乱了
    自一九五三年夏天开始，法、美帝国主义者便大事吹嘘所谓“纳瓦尔军事计划”。这个以第七任法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔为名的、旨在继续并扩大印度支那侵略战争的军事计划，是在美国军事当局直接参与下制订出来的。
    按照“纳瓦尔军事计划”，美国的军事物资和军事人员源源不断地运到印度支那，法国的十个营侵略军也从北非和朝鲜等地增调到印度支那，同时法、美帝国主义者并命令保大等傀儡政府在印度支那大肆搜捕青年以扩充伪军。
    纳瓦尔曾抨击他前任的法国侵略军总司令萨兰，认为萨兰最失算的地方在于过分分散兵力，以致遭受两次大失败——一九五二年冬在越南西北山萝地区的失败，以及一九五三年春在上寮桑怒地区的失败。纳瓦尔主张集中机动兵力，并充分运用伞兵和突击队，“绥靖”占领区的后方并袭击和进攻解放区，以取得“军事主动权”。
    从表面来看，纳瓦尔似乎胜过萨兰一筹；但在实际上，纳瓦尔并不比他的前任高明，甚至还要糟糕些。因为战争的性质已经决定了侵略者无法解决的一个矛盾：那就是要地呢，还是要人？分兵占领土地，就有被各个击破的危险；集中兵力，就要丢掉许多地方，最后甚至连人带地都一起丢光。
    当纳瓦尔在美国五角大楼支持下上任以后，曾经自鸣得意地推行着这个打算扭转整个战争趋势的计划。现在已经十个多月了，纳瓦尔不仅没有“扭转”了战争趋势，相反地却留下了许多败绩。尤其是最近三个多月来，这个侵略军的总司令在越南、高棉和寮国三国人民军队广泛开展的冬春战役中，接二连三地吃败仗。最初，美国国务卿杜勒斯还故作镇静地说：印度支那的局势“也不会有足以打乱纳瓦尔计划的大致时间表”。可是后来纳瓦尔的美国主子们却越来越不耐烦了，华尔街已经有许多人在叫嚷着要“调整”纳瓦尔的军事计划。
    三、冬春三个月
    去冬今春三个多月来，是纳瓦尔上任后遭到最惨重失败的日子。
    从去年十二月起，越南人民军先在北越、后在中越沉重地捶击着法国侵略军，越南其他战场上的军民也纷纷策应，有力地配合主要战场的作战；同时，在共同斗争中结下了巩固友谊的越南、高棉和寮国三国人民，为了击破法、美帝国主义者继续并扩大印度支那侵略战争的阴谋，也互相配合作战。在越南和寮国的各个战场上，自去年十二月中旬开始，广泛展开了冬春战役。
    这个规模巨大的战役，首先在越南西北莱州地区展开。当时纳瓦尔刚把约四个营的机动兵力空投到越南、寮国边界的奠边府，以便和困守在越南西北重镇莱州的侵略军互相呼应，并踞此以控制上寮和重新进犯越南西北解放区。但是英勇善战的越南人民军在半个月内就解放了莱州，使奠边府的侵略军陷入孤立无援之地。
    正当越南人民军在莱州获胜，逼迫纳瓦尔把印度支那五分之一的机动兵力投到奠边府的时候，寮国人民解放军在中寮第十二号公路两侧展开攻势作战，三天就歼灭侵略军将近三个步兵营和二个炮兵连，并一度占领甘蒙省省会他曲。紧接着寮国人民解放军又向南穿插，切断了自中寮重镇沙湾拿吉通中越的战略交通线第九号公路，歼灭了侵略军近一个营。
    为了配合北越作战和配合寮国人民解放军在中寮的进军，越南人民军自一月二十六日开始，在中越高原（西原）地区发动攻势，不到半月即解放西原的昆嵩省省会及该省大部地区，控制了自中越岘港至南越中心城市西贡的战略交通线十四号公路。二月十八日，越南人民军更乘胜向昆嵩东南的德陶亚据点进攻，歼灭刚从朝鲜调来不久的法国侵略军一个连大部。一月三十一日，寮国人民解放军又在下寮连接西原的波罗芬高原开展攻势，攻势发展的十分迅速，二月一日即解放了阿速坡，并接连攻克波罗芬高原的大部地区。和向下寮发动进攻的同时，寮国人民解放军在上寮南乌江流域发起攻势。自一月三十一日到二月三日，即歼灭和击溃法国侵略军约十六个连；至二月下半月，又挥戈北向，进击封萨里省，解放了该省省会及大部地区。封萨里省处于印度支那最北面的尖端，在战略上占有比较重要的地位。一九四五年三月，日本法西斯占领印度支那的时候，法国侵略军就是经过那里逃到中国的云南去的；八月日本投降后，法国侵略军又以那里为跳板重新侵占越南西北的莱州、山萝等省。寮国人民解放军在南乌江流域的进攻，并进而解放封萨里省，有力地支持越南人民军对空投奠边府的法国侵略军的围困。
    越南人民军和寮国人民解放军接连发动的一系列攻势，使法、美帝国主义者大为震动，逼迫纳瓦尔不得不把刚集中起来的机动兵力分散到十分危急的各个战场上去；但当纳瓦尔从北越、南越和高棉抽兵之后，在法国侵略军的占领区，尤其是占领区的后方——自南面的湄公河三角洲直到北面的红河三角洲，即处在越南人民武装的威逼之下，越南军民随时都可以在这些地区自由来去，袭击并摧毁法国侵略军的据点、弹药库、飞机场、火车和船艇，有力地配合作战。纳瓦尔支持分散在遥远战线上作战部队的唯一办法就是依靠空中运输，但这条空中运输线也很难维持住了。因为分布各处的空军基地并不是那样的安全。在上寮的芒塞机场时常被炮火所轰击，在红河三角洲上的机场更不时被袭击。三月初，越南人民军在三月四日和六日就先后袭击位于河内、海防附近的嘉林和吉碑两机场，当场击毁飞机七十八架之多。法国空军在战争以来受到这样严重损失还是第一次。在陆地上，法国侵略军在北越、中越和南越的占领区不但日见缩小，而且日益不安稳。即使是法国侵略军的心腹地带也是不大安稳，海防至河内的法国侵略军的重要运输线——第五号公路，以及和公路平行的铁路一而再地被切断，许多重要据点纷纷被拔除，留下的少数机动兵力和守备部队也一天天的在削弱了。
    同时，高棉人民武装也在积极活动起来，有力地策应越南人民军和寮国人民解放军的攻势。
    四、法国侵略者的尴尬处境
    越南、高棉和寮国人民军队所发动的冬春战役，到三月中旬达到第一个高峰。围困奠边府的越南人民军在三月十三日下午开始向这个法国侵略军的集团据点进攻。这次攻势是印度支那战争中空前猛烈的一次。越南人民军在炮火掩护下，连续攻破侵略军奠边府集团据点两个最强固的抵抗中心——新兰和独立山，全歼法国侵略军精锐部队两个营；紧接着，越南人民军又攻下板骄据点，逼使两连泰族伪军投降。越南人民军首次攻击，就迅速摧毁了奠边府整个的北部防线，置侵略军集团据点的中心地带在自己的直接威胁之下。
    奠边府初次交锋，法国侵略军就遭到了惨败，
  “钢铁堡垒”的神话被戳穿了。法国侵略军在这次惨败之后，就着手加固了工事，又被迫地从正在吃紧的红河三角洲和中寮再抽调两、三个营的机动兵力投到奠边府来。
    可是，刚过半个多月，越南人民军就再次向奠边府集团据点发动进攻。自三月三十日至四月二日这四天之中，迅速将奠边府东部防线大部摧毁，直接威胁着法国侵略军在奠边府的指挥首脑和飞机场；奠边府西部的防线也同时被突破，在那里站住了脚并迫使泰族伪军两个连投降。仅是这四天的战斗，奠边府的守军又被歼灭了一个营又九个连。越南人民军经过两次的作战，已经从北、东、西三个方向逼近了奠边府集团据点的中心——芒清。
    奠边府，已经成了法国侵略军一个大包袱了。法国侵略军是在美国战争贩子的唆使下，背起了这个大包袱的。但是自从纳瓦尔背起这个大包袱之后，在最近的三个多月来，已经遭到了一连串的失败，而且失败一次比一次惨重。
