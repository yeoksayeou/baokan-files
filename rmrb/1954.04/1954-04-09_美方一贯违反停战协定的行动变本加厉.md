Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 8th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on April 7th, the Korean and Chinese side lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding the US side's armed attacks on our military control area and the Demilitarized Zone, as well as the shelling of our Demilitarized Zone. As in the past, the US side attempted to deny responsibility for violating the Armistice Agreement with empty denials.

General Li Sang-cho only listed the three most recent incidents that occurred continuously in just five days from April 1st to 5th in his protest, while the US side's actions violating the Armistice Agreement have been consistent and numerous. The records of the Military Armistice Commission and the meetings of the secretaries of both sides prove that in the nine months since the armistice, US military aircraft have crossed the Military Demarcation Line 232 times, the US side has fired guns and cannons into the Korean and Chinese side's Demilitarized Zone six times, and US personnel have crossed the Military Demarcation Line eleven times.

The situation in March further shows that the US side's violations of the Armistice Agreement on the ground are not only increasing in frequency, but have also blatantly developed into openly launching armed attacks on the Korean and Chinese side's military control areas and the Demilitarized Zone. On March 5th, six US armed personnel intruded into our Demilitarized Zone in Baekcheon-ri near Panmunjom and attacked our civil police, two of whom were captured by us. On March 13th, three US armed personnel intruded into our military control area northeast of Mundeung-ri, one of whom was shot and killed on the spot by our side, and one was captured. On March 14th, thirteen US armed personnel secretly crossed from Ganghwa Island to our area in the Yeonbaek area of the West Coast, wounding resident Kim Gap-song. After being discovered by our side, one was shot and killed, and one was captured. These facts all prove that the US side violated the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the cessation of all hostile actions and regarding the Demilitarized Zone.

In addition, the US side's bloody atrocities of forcibly detaining and murdering Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have undermined the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war in the Armistice Agreement; the US side has transported reinforcements of military forces through various illegal means, undermining and continuing to undermine the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding rotation and replacement and the functions of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In short, the US side has wantonly violated all substantive provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and judging from recent developments, this violation is increasing unabated.

As the Geneva Conference draws nearer, the US side, disregarding the calls of people around the world for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, is increasingly and seriously violating the Armistice Agreement. This clearly shows that the US side intends to maintain tension in Korea and obstruct a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The US side dares not openly admit this sinister purpose before the people of the world. Therefore, the US side's representatives at the Military Armistice Commission simply deny everything, and US Secretary of State Dulles even slanders the Korean and Chinese side for violating the Armistice Agreement. However, the facts are all there, and no amount of denial or counter-accusation can cover them up.

### 美方一贯违反停战协定的行动变本加厉

    美方一贯违反停战协定的行动变本加厉
  【新华社开城八日电】在四月七日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面就美方武装袭击我方军事控制地区和非军事区以及炮击我方非军事区的事件，向美方提出了严重抗议。美方又像过去一样，企图用空口否认来抵赖违反停战协定的责任。
    李相朝将军在抗议中只列举了四月一日至五日仅仅五天之内连续发生的最近三个事件，而美方违反停战协定的行动是一贯的、大量发生的。军事停战委员会和双方秘书长会议的记录证明：在停战以后的九个月中，美方军用飞机越过军事分界线上空共达二百三十二次，美方以枪炮向朝中方面非军事区射击共有六次，美方人员越过军事分界线共有十一次。
    三月份的情况更表明：美方在地面上的违反停战协定的事件不仅次数正在增加，而且已露骨地发展为公然向朝中方面军事控制区和非军事区进行武装袭击了。三月五日，美方武装人员六人侵入板门店附近白田里我方非军事区，袭击我方民政警察，被我捕获两名。三月十三日美方武装人员三人在文登里东北侵入我方军事控制区，当场被我方击毙一人，捕获一人。三月十四日，美方武装人员十三人自江华岛偷渡至西海岸延白地区我方区域，打伤居民金甲松，被我方发觉后击毙一人，捕获一人。这些事实都证明美方违反了停战协定中关于停止一切敌对行动和关于非军事区的各项条款。
    此外，美方强迫扣留和杀害朝中被俘人员的血腥暴行破坏了停战协定中关于战俘问题的协议；美方通过各种非法方式运入增援性的军事力量，破坏了并正继续破坏着停战协定中关于轮换与替换以及中立国监察委员会的职权的规定。总之，停战协定中一切实质性的条款，美方都横加破坏，而且从最近的发展看来，这种破坏还正有增无已。
    在日内瓦会议日益临近的时候，美方不顾全世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的呼声，日益严重地违反停战协定，这显然说明美方是有意要在朝鲜保持紧张局势，阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题。美方这种罪恶目的不敢在世界人民面前公开。所以，美方委员在军事停战委员会上就矢口抵赖，而美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至反过来诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定。然而，事实俱在，不是任何抵赖和反噬所能掩盖得掉的。
