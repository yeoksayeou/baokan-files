    Moscow, April 25th (By our correspondent, Li He) Welcoming the May 1st International Labor Day, Soviet agricultural laborers are enthusiastically launching a socialist competition to strive for participation in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition.

    The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, scheduled to open in Moscow on August 1st, is a school for publicizing the achievements of Soviet post-war agriculture and promoting advanced agricultural experiences and agricultural science. The scale of the exhibition will be grand. More than 300 exhibition halls and buildings are being constructed on an area of more than 200 hectares. Sixteen republics will have their own exhibition halls. There will be specialized exhibition halls for grains, potatoes, vegetables, sugar beets, fruits, etc. There will be 79 buildings for exhibiting animal husbandry. Nearly 2,000 varieties of 260 types of crops will be exhibited. Eight hundred kinds of agricultural machinery will be displayed in the 26 halls of the "Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification" exhibition hall.

    This year, more than 800 collective farms, 300 state farms, 200 machine tractor stations, machine livestock stations, forest protection stations, and pasture improvement stations, more than 300 livestock farms, many agricultural scientific research institutions, experimental stations, and other units, and no less than 6,000 advanced workers will participate in the exhibition. Participants are selected based on the quantity of livestock products per 100 hectares of land, the level of mechanization of production and the adoption of advanced methods, and the achievements in reclaiming virgin and fallow land. The standards are much higher than those for participating in the agricultural exhibition before the war. For example, collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic are only eligible to participate if the total wheat yield of the farm reaches 2,200 kilograms per hectare, while before the war, those with more than 1,500 kilograms could participate.

    The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition is of a permanent nature. Not only are advanced units and individuals who have qualified for participation based on their achievements in 1952 and 1953 striving to develop agricultural production this year in order to gain the right to participate next year.

    Agricultural laborers in Kuban are welcoming the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition with a new surge of labor. The "Great Bear" machine tractor station in Timoshevsky District, which was visited by the Chinese farmers' delegation, guarantees high yields for the "Road to Communism" collective farm, the "Molotov" collective farm, and the "Voroshilov" collective farm it serves every year. In 1952, 3,280 kilograms of grain were harvested per hectare from 129,500 hectares of land; in 1953, about 2,300 kilograms of winter wheat were harvested per hectare from 9,600 hectares of land, and 2,200 kilograms of sunflowers were harvested per hectare from 1,792 hectares of land. The laborers of this tractor station and these collective farms guarantee a harvest of 2,800 kilograms of winter wheat per hectare, 2,100 kilograms of spring wheat, 2,700 kilograms of barley, 3,100 kilograms of corn, and 2,300 kilograms of sunflowers.

    In the Uzbek Republic, the "Kyzyl Uzbekistan" collective farm in Ordzhonikidze District, Tashkent Oblast, has a very high annual cotton yield. In 1953, 3,890 kilograms of cotton were harvested per hectare. Seeing that their farm was recommended as a candidate for the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, the villagers decided to harvest 4,000 kilograms of cotton per hectare this year.

    In the Turkmen Republic, the "Red October" collective farm in Kalinin District harvested an average of 2,530 kilograms of fine-fiber cotton per hectare from 1,055 hectares of land in the past two years. The members of this collective farm, which has qualified to participate in the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, guarantee to expand the cotton sowing area by 215 hectares this year by reclaiming wasteland.

    Spring sowing is spreading from south to north with the spring colors. Spring arrived relatively late in the Soviet Union this year. Spring sowing must be completed within a tight timeframe. Relying on powerful agricultural machinery, Soviet agricultural laborers are enthusiastically, rapidly, and well carrying out spring sowing on cultivated land and on reclaimed virgin and fallow land, laying a solid foundation for this year's agricultural bumper harvest.

    争取参加全苏农业展览会的竞赛
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    迎接着五一节，苏联农业劳动者热烈地展开社会主义竞赛，以争取参加全苏农业展览会。
    将于八月一日在莫斯科开幕的全苏农业展览会，是宣传苏联战后农业成就，推广农业先进经验和农业科学的学校。展览会的规模将是宏大的。在二百多公顷面积上盖着三百多个展览馆和建筑物。十六个加盟共和国都将有自己的展览馆。谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、甜菜、水果等等都将有专门的展览馆。展览饲畜业的建筑物将有七十九个。将有二百六十类农作物的近两千品种展览。在“农业机械化和电气化”展览馆的二十六个厅中将陈列八百种农业机器。
    今年参加展览会的将有八百多个集体农庄，三百个国营农场，二百个机器拖拉机站、机器饲畜站、护林站和牧场改良站，三百多个饲畜场，许多农业科学研究机关、实验站和其他单位，不下六千先进工作者。参加者是按每一百公顷土地上畜产品的数量，按生产的机械化和采用先进方法的情况，按开垦生、熟荒地的成绩来挑选的。标准比战前参加农业展览会的高得多。例如，乌克兰共和国的集体农庄，全庄小麦产量每公顷达二千二百公斤的才有资格参加，而战前产一千五百公斤以上的就可以参加。
    全苏农业展览会是常设性质的。不仅以一九五二年和一九五三年的成绩获得参加资格的先进单位和个人，而且为了争取来年获得参加权利的单位和个人，都在努力发展今年的农业生产。
    库班农业劳动者以新的劳动高涨迎接全苏农业展览会。中国农民代表参观团访问过的季摩舍夫斯基区“大熊”机器拖拉机站年年保证它所服务的“到共产主义之路”集体农庄、“莫洛托夫”集体农庄、“伏罗希洛夫”集体农庄取得高度收获量。在一九五二年，从十二万九千五百公顷土地上谷物每公顷收获了三千二百八十公斤；在一九五三年，从九千六百公顷土地上冬小麦每公顷收获了约二千三百公斤，从一千七百九十二公顷土地上向日葵每公顷收获了二千二百公斤。这个拖拉机站和这些集体农庄的劳动者保证今年冬小麦每公顷收获二千八百公斤，春小麦——二千一百公斤，大麦——二千七百公斤，包谷——三千一百公斤，向日葵——二千三百公斤。
    在乌兹别克共和国，塔什干州奥尔忠尼启则区“克兹·乌斯别克斯坦”集体农庄每年棉花产量很高。一九五三年每公顷收获了三千八百九十公斤棉花。庄员看到自己农庄被推荐为全苏农业展览会的候选者，决定今年在每公顷上收获四千公斤棉花。
    在土库曼共和国，加里宁区“红十月”集体农庄在前两年从一千零五十五公顷土地上平均每公顷收获细纤维棉花二千五百三十公斤。这个获得参加全苏农业展览会资格的集体农庄庄员保证今年以开垦荒地办法，扩大棉花播种面积二百十五公顷。
    春播随着春色从南向北伸展着。今年春天在苏联开始得比较晚。春播必须在紧迫的时间内完成。苏联农业劳动者依靠着雄厚的农业机器，在耕地上，在开垦的生、熟荒地上，热情地迅速地很好进行着春季的播种，为今年的农业丰产打下结实的基础。
