Five films dubbed in Tibetan or with Tibetan narration have recently begun distribution in Tibetan areas.

The five films are: the feature film "Golden and Silver Beach," depicting the struggle and life of the Tibetan people, and the documentary "The People's Liberation Army Marching into Tibet"; the feature film "People on the Prairie," depicting the struggle and life of the Mongolian people; and the documentary "1953 National Day" and the science education film "Safe Motherhood." The distribution of these films is of great significance in improving the cultural life of the Tibetan people and in promoting the nationality policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

These films were dubbed by the Northeast Film Studio from July 1953 to March 1954. Those who participated in the dubbing work included Sangre Gyatso, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Huanjue Cailang, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and sixteen other Tibetan cadres, teachers, and students from Tibetan areas. They were all new to artistic work, but due to their active and enthusiastic work and their diligence and humility in learning, they finally overcame many translation difficulties between the two languages and successfully completed the dubbing of the five films, and the quality of the dubbing was very good. To commend their remarkable achievements in this work, Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, presented certificates of merit to Sangre Gyatso and Huanjue Cailang on April 6.

    五部藏语翻译影片在藏族地区开始发行
    五部配有藏语对白或藏语解说的影片，最近已在藏族地区开始发行。
    这五部影片是：表现藏族人民斗争生活的故事片“金银滩”和纪录片“解放西藏大军行”，表现蒙族人民斗争生活的故事片“草原上的人们”，以及纪录片“一九五三年国庆节”和科学教育片“母子平安”。这些影片的发行，在提高藏族人民的文化生活和宣传共产党、人民政府的民族政策上都有重要的意义。
    这些影片是由东北电影制片厂从一九五三年七月到一九五四年三月期间译制的。参加译制工作的有青海省人民政府文教厅副厅长桑热嘉错，中国新民主主义青年团青海省工作委员会统一战线工作部部长宦爵才誏和其他藏族地区的藏族干部、教员、学生共十六人。他们都是初次接触艺术工作，但是由于他们积极热情的工作和刻苦虚心的学习，终于克服了两种语言在翻译上的许多困难，胜利地完成了五部影片的译制任务，而且译制的质量都很好。为了表扬他们在这一工作中的显著成绩，中央人民政府文化部部长沈雁冰曾在四月六日以奖状发给桑热嘉错和宦爵才誏。（新华社）
