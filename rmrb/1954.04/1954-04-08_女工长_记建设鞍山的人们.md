Female Foreman
——Recording the People Building Anshan
By our reporter Lù Hào

Before I even met Li Yanxin, I already knew a lot about her work on the construction site.

When old foreman Liu Chunshan talked about Li Yanxin, an expression of admiration appeared on his face. He said:

“I’ve seen quite a few technicians on the construction site, men and women, but not many are as capable as her.

“When our prefabrication workshop was making roof panels, I climbed onto the roof with her to inspect the work. From the eaves to the ridge, it was over ten meters wide. Scaffolding hadn't been built yet, just two poles propped up with some crossbars. When I got close to the poles, I felt dizzy because the house was so high off the ground, there was nowhere to put my hands, and the crossbars were wobbly. Several times, I just couldn't bring myself to walk across.

“When Li Yanxin saw this, she said, ‘Let me try.’ Some people didn't believe it, muttering to themselves, ‘People who've been on construction sites for over ten years can’t do it, how could she possibly walk across?’ Our female foreman, she looked straight ahead, calmly stepped onto the crossbars, and without batting an eye, she quickly walked up the ridge.”

A construction site director also told me about Li Yanxin's work, including an incident that occurred during the responsibility system campaign on the site.

At that time, technicians were required to be responsible for checking and accepting materials, but some people felt that this rule was too easy to offend people. If you checked the materials, the materials department would say you didn’t trust them; truck drivers were paid according to the number of trips they made, and checking materials would waste their time, so of course they wouldn’t be happy. She thought: every time something starts, there will be difficulties. If no one takes action, how can the work begin? It just so happened that in those few days, she found that the sand used in the work section had run short even after three supplementary budget requests. She thought, there must be a problem here.

A truck carrying sand arrived, and she took a ruler and explained to the driver that she needed to check it. She said, “Please help me measure it before unloading.”

“No need to measure,” the driver said. He was a little surprised to see a woman asking him. He thought, I’ve seen some female technicians on the construction site, but no one has ever interfered with my truck trips.

“Why?”

“It’s the same whether you measure it or not. Measure it yourself if you want to.” To be honest, the driver looked down on her a little.

“Which unit are you from?” Li Yanxin asked the truck driver.

“I’m a worker at Angang. I think you're really something.” Clearly, the driver was getting angry.

Li Yanxin smiled and said, “I’m not anything special. The state has entrusted me with this job, and I am exercising my authority.”

In the end, the truck driver was honestly persuaded by her because she discovered that most of the sand transported by truck was short.

On the construction site, I also heard about Li Yanxin criticizing Liu Yecheng more than once.

During the construction of the No. 6 “Foundation” for the gas pipeline, the old pipes that were unloaded broke the water pipe in the "Foundation," and the entire "Foundation" was flooded, forcing the tense concrete pouring project to stop.

This accident was directly related to the No. 3 team of the Metal Structure Company, but Liu Yecheng, the captain of the No. 3 team, did not promptly send someone to repair the broken water pipe. People heard that Liu Yecheng was difficult to deal with, so no one dared to go to him, and the urgent project was delayed.

Li Yanxin was working on the plan and budget in the office at the time, but she couldn't bear to see the urgent project being stopped. She went to see Liu Yecheng.

“Captain Liu, please help solve the water pipe problem.”

Liu Yecheng saw that a female technician had come, and he replied, “Do you have to come to me for such a small thing?”

“Delaying us is like delaying you.”

“I know.” Liu Yecheng thought, you just came out of school, do you need to tell me that?

“Then please take care of it.”

Liu Yecheng got angry when someone argued with him. He said, "I don't care."

“How can you not care?”

“You can report me to our manager and have me fired. I'm just irresponsible, what can you do to me?"

Li Yanxin couldn't help but get angry when she heard this. She said, "How can you be so big and say such things?"

“What’s so great about you, you intellectual.”

“The knowledge was given to me by the state,” Li Yanxin said sternly, pointing at him. “It’s because you lack knowledge that you don’t care about the overall situation. I don’t allow you to do this.”

No matter how tough Liu Yecheng was verbally, the water pipe of the No. 6 “Foundation” was quickly repaired.

A female comrade encounters more difficulties than male comrades when working on a construction site. This is because, in the eyes of some people, there's no need for female comrades to work on construction sites. Female comrades should be like female comrades, for example, it’s best to walk elegantly, speak softly, but someone like Li Yanxin is too "fierce" and too "outspoken."

In fact, when I met Li Yanxin, she wasn't necessarily tall and strong like an athlete, or someone who spoke loudly, a so-called "fierce" person. She had a medium build, a round face, always with a rosy complexion. Although her eyes were not big, her long eyelashes and lively pupils made her appear to be a smart and capable girl. Her well-proportioned hair curled at the ends, maintaining the unique style of a typical southern girl, always looking clean and tidy. It was hard to imagine that she had experienced such arduous training during those tense construction days.

When I met her, I asked, "Comrade Li Yanxin, please talk about your situation on the construction site."

She shook her head and said, "I've only been out of school for two years. I'm just starting to learn, I really don't think there's anything I can tell you."

I said, "I heard that during the construction of the steam pipeline's 'foundation,' you didn't leave the construction site for three days and nights. Please talk about that."

"It wasn't just me," she said. "At that time, because the task was urgent, everyone was worried about the quality of the project, so our section chief, branch secretary, and many other comrades didn't go home for several days and nights. What's there to say about that?"

On the construction site, I had heard that when the prefabrication workshop was building the "foundation," the steel and wooden formwork team initially said that it would take sixteen man-hours to erect one square meter of wooden formwork. Thanks to Li Yanxin's exposure and inspection, it later turned out that only two and a half man-hours were needed. The management problems of the steel and wooden formwork team were thus ruthlessly exposed and then rectified. I said, "Then please tell me about how you exposed the steel and wooden formwork team."

She said, "This problem was solved by the power of everyone. As a technician working on the site, I just did what I was supposed to do."

I asked her several times, but she didn't talk about herself much. Later, she said, "If you really want to ask, I can tell you about the situation of the bricklaying team led by Duan Hongchang."

“Just as the large rolling mill that the people of the whole country were expecting was preparing for trial operation, it was suddenly discovered that the oil depot was leaking water.

“The oil depot had been built long ago. The so-called leak was mainly due to problems with the waterproof layer and other work when pouring concrete. Now that all the projects were almost completed, the oil depot started to leak.

“The task was very urgent, and the problem had to be solved within ten days.

“The bricklayer Duan Hongchang and his team took on this task.

“In that leaking oil depot, one place was because the support column for the fixed frame was poured into the cement. Now, about three hundred millimeters of the column foot left in the 'foundation' had been rotted by the water, falling off bit by bit, and the water flowed like a fountain on the 'foundation.'

“At that time, the method of stopping the leak was to mix a liquid called a waterproofing agent with concrete, and then use this concrete to block the leaking place, because it would quickly solidify within half a minute.

“However, mixing the waterproofing agent with concrete required using both hands, because at that time, the people working on the oil depot only had one pair of rubber gloves. Many people's fingers were burned red, and after a long time, their hands were covered with blisters. When the blisters broke, the bright red flesh was exposed. If it was immersed in concrete again, both hands would feel as painful as if they were being pricked with needles.

“In this situation, Duan Hongchang's bricklaying team, no one frowned. Everyone was drenched from head to toe, with not a single dry spot. They still insisted on working. Because the water was strong, the concrete that was plugged often washed away before it could solidify. People used all their strength, pressing in the concrete with both hands at the same time, but it didn't work. They even really wanted to plug it with their own bodies, but in the end, they couldn't plug it because the hole was too big and the water was too fast.

“Later, people came up with a solution: because the hole was square, someone found a rubber tube and inserted it into the middle of the gushing water. In this way, some of the water flowed out of the rubber tube. Everyone first plugged the concrete on the four corners, and finally plugged the middle, which quickly stopped the water.

“Although the water was stopped, everyone's hands were burned by the concrete and could not be straightened, curling up like chicken claws. When eating, the hands would shrink back when they picked up chopsticks, hurting so much that they couldn't even hold chopsticks.

“Just after solving the problem of the column feet, the ventilation shaft of another oil depot started to leak water. This ventilation shaft was only a little over one meter in diameter and two hundred and twenty meters long. People had to crawl in like frogs. A fatter person couldn't get in, and a thinner person would fill the entire ventilation shaft after getting in. Crawling into the ventilation shaft, the whole body felt like it was soaked in water. When working, you had to sit up, hunching your back and tilting your head, holding a mortar board in one hand and curling up the other, plastering bit by bit. After sitting for several days, blisters formed on the buttocks, hurting so much that they couldn't sleep at night. In the end, some people could only simply lie down to work.

“The water underground was like millions of long snakes, drilling wherever there was a hole. You couldn't see where the water was coming from. For example, the 'foundation' had just been swept dry, and after a while, water was everywhere on the ground and walls.

“Some of these water holes were as small as pinholes. At such places, we started to apply the waterproofing agent with a brush, but after using it a few times, the brush would ball up and could no longer be used. If the brush couldn't be used, we still had to use our hands. The hands of the people who participated in this work were almost peeled off like shrimp, and there were small holes on their fingers. They had to grit their teeth and shake their hands for a while before they could continue to apply the waterproofing agent again.

“This is the simple situation of Duan Hongchang and his team's work in blocking the oil depot.”

As for herself, it seemed like this had nothing to do with her.

I asked the bricklayers of Duan Hongchang's team. I said, "How is your female foreman working with you?"

Duan Hongchang, the captain of the bricklaying team, replied, "Our female foreman is no worse than us men. Sometimes she even walks ahead of us. For example, we only had one pair of rubber gloves to use when applying the waterproofing agent with our hands. Seeing that she was a woman, we decided to give them to her, but she firmly insisted on letting us use them. Once, one of our oil depot 'foundations' was flooded. Our female foreman had just started work when she heard the news. She immediately ran to the oil depot. Although it was June, the oil depot was more than six meters deep and never saw the sun. There was more than one meter of water inside, gloomy and dirty, and there was also the rotten stench of hemp rope ends and hay left over from the work. Some of the people who went with her hesitated when they saw this situation, saying, 'How can we go down without rubber boots?' Our female foreman, she didn't say a word, took off her leather shoes, rolled up her neatly ironed light blue trousers above her knees, turned around and climbed down. The black, muddy water immediately soaked her trouser legs. When everyone saw this, they jumped down one by one. Although the water was very deep, she took the lead in directing us, and the water was quickly cleaned up by everyone.

The bricklayers also unanimously said, "She is always with us in difficult times. Comrade reporter, if you want to tell others about how we fought against difficulties, then please be sure to write down her name."

    女工长
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者　陆灏
    在我还没有见到李延馨的时候，关于她在工地上的情形，我已经知道得很多了。
    老领工员刘春山向我谈起李延馨的时候，他的脸上露出一种敬佩的表情。他说：
    “在工地上我见过的技术员，男的女的并不算少，但比她能干的却不多。
    “我们整模车间做房盖的时候，我和她一同爬上房顶去检查工作。从檐口到屋脊，有十几公尺宽，跳板和脚手架还没有搭，光秃秃地架着两根杆子，绑上一些横档。我走近杆子，因为房子离地太高，手没有地方放，踩的横档又摇幌，一走上去，就头晕眼花，好几次，怎么也不敢走过去。
    “李延馨见这情形，她说：‘我试试看。’有人不相信，暗暗地嘀咕说：‘人家在工地上呆过十多年还走不了，凭她还能走过去。’我们的女工长，她的眼看着前面，平平静静，走上横档，面不改色，一霎那，她已经飞快地走上屋脊了。”
    一位工地主任也告诉我一些关于李延馨工作的情形，其中有一件是在工地上开展责任制运动时发生的。
    当时在技术人员中规定要负责点收材料，但有些人觉得这个规定太容易得罪人。如果要点收，材料部门的人会说你不信任他们；卡车司机是按照运送的次数计算运费的，点收材料就要耽误他的时间，当然会不愿意。她想：每一件事情起头的时候，都一定会碰到困难的，如果谁也不行动，这工作怎么能开始呢。恰巧那几天，她发现工段里使用的砂子，作了三次追加预算仍不够用，她想，这里准有问题。
    有一辆载运砂子的卡车开来了，她拿了尺子，向司机同志说明要点收。她说：“请你帮助我量一下再卸车。”
    “不用量。”司机同志说。他见来了一个女同志问他，心里有点奇怪。他想，工地上的女技术员也见过一些，可是他的卡车运来运去，从来没有人干涉过他。
    “为什么？”
    “量不量就那么多，要量你自己量。”老实说，司机同志有点看不起她。
    “你是那个单位的？”李延馨问卡车司机。
   “我是鞍钢职工。我看你真是了不起。”很显然，司机同志生气了。
    李延馨笑着说：“我没有什么了不起，国家交给我这样一件工作，我是在行使我的职权。”
    最后，那位卡车司机还是老老实实被她说服了，因为她发现了大部分用卡车运来的砂子是不足数的。
    我在工地上，还曾经不止一次地听到过关于李延馨批评刘业成的事。
    瓦斯管道的六号“基础”施工的时候，卸下来的旧管道把“基础”里的水管压断了，于是整个的
  “基础”被水淹没，紧张的混凝土浇灌工程不得不停下来。
    发生这件事故和金属结构公司的三队有着直接的关系，而三队队长刘业成对断了的水管却不及时派人修理。人们因为听说刘业成不好惹，所以谁也不敢去找他，紧张的工程就这样被耽误下来了。
    李延馨这时正在室内做计划预算工作，但她不能眼看紧张的工程被停顿下来，她去找见了刘业成。
   “刘队长，请你帮助把水管问题解决解决吧。”
    刘业成见来了个女技术员，他回答说。“这一点事也要找我吗？”
    “耽误我们，也像耽误了你们一样。”
   “我知道。”刘业成想，你才从学校出来多久，这还用得着你说吗？
   “那你还是管一管吧。”
    刘业成见有人给他顶嘴，就动了肝火。他说：“我不管。”
    “你不管怎么行。”
   “你去报告我们经理撤我的职好了。我就是不负责任，你能把我怎样？”
    李延馨一听也忍不住了。她说：“你这样大的个子，怎么好意思说这话呢？”
     “你有什么了不起，你这个知识分子。”
     “知识是国家给我的，”李延馨严肃地指着他说：“你就是因为缺少知识，才不顾大体。我不允许你这样做。”
    不管刘业成口头上多么厉害，但六号“基础”的水管以后很快就被修好了。
    一个女同志在工地上工作，她比男同志会遇到更多的困难。这是因为在有些人看来，女同志何必要在工地上工作，觉得女同志应该像个女同志，比如走起路来，最好斯斯文文，说起话来，应该柔声柔气，像李延馨那样，就太“厉害”了，太“泼辣”了。
    其实，在我见到李延馨的时候，她倒并不一定个子高大，身体健壮得像个运动员那样，或者说起话来，嗓门挺高，是个所谓“厉害”的人。她有一副中等的身材，圆圆的脸孔，什么时候也带着红晕，虽然眼睛不大，但长长的睫毛和灵活的眼珠，显得她是一个聪明和能干的姑娘。匀称的头发卷着边，保持着像一般南方姑娘那样独有的样式，什么时候也显得清洁和整齐。很难想像，就是她，在那些工程紧张的日子里，经历了艰苦的锻炼。
    我见到了她，就问：“李延馨同志，请你谈谈你在工地上的情形吧。”
    她摇摇头说：“我从学校里出来才两年多。我正在开始学习，真的觉得没有什么可以告诉你。”
    我说：“听说你在蒸气管道的‘基础’施工的时候，你有三个昼夜没有离开工地，请你就谈谈这件事情吧。”
      “这并不是我一个人这样。”她说：“那时候，因为任务紧急，大家担心工程的质量，因而我们工段的段长、支部书记，还有别的不少同志，都是好几个昼夜没有回家。这有什么可说的呢。”
    我在工地上，曾经听说过整模车间打“基础”的时候，钢筋木模队支一平方公尺木模，开头说需要十六个人工，由于李延馨的揭发和检查，后来实际上两个半工就可以了。钢筋木模队管理上的问题由此被更无情地暴露出来，并从而得到了整顿。我说：“那么请你讲讲关于如何揭发钢筋木模队的事情吧。”
    她说：“这个问题是靠大家的力量解决的。作为一个在现场上施工的技术人员，我只是做了我应该做的事情。”
    我几次问她，她总是不大谈到她自己。后来，她说：“如果你一定要问，我倒可以给你讲讲关于段洪昌领导的瓦工小队的情形。”
      “正在全国人民所期望的大型轧钢厂的轧钢机准备试验运转的时候，突然发现油库里面漏水了。
    “油库是早就做好了的。所谓漏水，主要是因为在浇灌混凝土的时候，做防水层和别的工作出了毛病。现在一切工程都快接近完工了，而油库却漏起水来。
    “任务很紧急，必须在十几天的时间内解决这个问题。
    “瓦工段洪昌和他领导的小队担任了这个任务。
    “那油库冒水，有一个地方，是因为把支固定架的柱子灌在水泥里了。现在留在‘基础’里大约有三百公厘长的柱脚已经被水泡烂，一丝一丝地掉下来，水像喷泉似地流在‘基础’上。
    “当时堵漏水的办法，是用一种叫防水剂的液体和混凝土掺和在一起，然后把这种混凝土堵住漏水的地方，因为它在半分钟内就会很快凝固。
      “可是，用防水剂和混凝土和在一起，必须用两只手来工作，因为当时在油库上工作的人只有一副胶皮手套。很多人的手指头被灼得绯红，时间长了，满手都是一个一个白泡。白泡破了，鲜红的肉就露在外面，如果再浸在混凝土里，两只手就像挨针扎一般地痛苦。
    “段洪昌的瓦工小队在这种情形下，谁也没皱过眉头，大家被水浇得从头到脚，一点点干的地方也没有。仍旧坚持工作。因为水势大，堵上去的混凝土，常常不等凝固，就被冲掉了。人们使用了全部力量，用两只手和混凝土同时按进去，也不顶事。甚至真想把自己的身体也堵上去，结果终因为窟窿大，水势太急，堵不住。
    “后来人们想了个办法：因为那个窟窿是四方的，有人找来了一根橡皮管，把它插在冒出的水的当中，这样，有一部分水从橡皮管中流出去了。大家在四个角上先堵上混凝土，最后才堵当中的，这就很快把水堵住了。
      “水虽然被堵住了，但大家的两只手，却被混凝土烧得伸也伸不直，像鸡爪子一样弯蜷着。吃饭的时候，一拿筷子，手就要缩回来，疼得连筷子也不能拿。
    “刚刚解决了柱脚问题，另外一个油库的通风筒又冒水了。这个通风筒，直径只有一公尺高一些，有二百二十多公尺长。人进去，得像青蛙似地爬进去，胖一点的人进不去，瘦人进去后，就把整个通风筒塞满了。钻进通风筒，全身好像泡在水里头，做工作时，坐起来，还得伛着腰，歪着头，一只手拿着灰板，另一只手还得蜷着，一点一点抹。连坐几天，屁股上起泡，疼得晚上睡觉也睡不成，到最后，有的人只能干脆躺在里头工作。
      “那地底下的水，活像千万条长蛇，有孔就钻。眼睛看不见水从那里来，比如‘基础’刚刚扫干，一会儿，地上墙上，到处都返着水光。
     “这样的水洞，有的小到只有针孔一般大。在这样的地方抹防水剂，开始是用毛刷，用了几次，毛刷就团在一起，不能再用了。毛刷不能用，仍旧得用手。参加这个工作的人，两只手都几乎像虾一样脱了一层皮，手指上都是小洞洞，用手醮了防水剂，得咬紧牙，甩一会手，才能坚持着再去抹一回。
   “这就是瓦工段洪昌和他的小队在堵油库工作中的简单的情形。”
    至于她自己，好像这件事情和她没有什么关系。
      我问段洪昌小队的瓦工们。我说：“你们的女工长和你们在一起工作得怎么样？”
    瓦工小队长段洪昌回答我说：“我们的女工长，她比我们男人一点也不差。有时候她还走在我们前面呢。比如我们用手抹防水剂，只有一付胶皮手套，我们见她是个女同志，大伙决定给她带，但她坚决让给我们用。有一次，我们的一个油库‘基础’被水淹了。我们的女工长刚上班，她听到这个消息，马上就跑到油库去。虽然是六月天气，油库有六公尺多深，从来见不到阳光，只见那里头有一公尺多深的水，阴沉和肮脏，还有，因为收工的时候所遗留下来的麻绳头、谷草所散发的腐烂的恶臭。和她一同去的人见到这种情形，有的就犹疑起来，说：‘没有胶鞋，我们怎么下去。’我们的女工长呢，只见她不声不响，脱下了皮鞋，把那条浅蓝色的摺得十分熨贴的裤腿卷过膝盖，一个转身就爬了下去，那黑汪汪的水，马上浸湿了她的裤腿。大家一见这样子，一个一个都跳下去了。虽然是水深得厉害，她带头指挥着我们，这水很快就被大家弄干净了。
    瓦工们也一致地说：“我们在困难的时候，她总和我们在一起。记者同志，你如果要向别人谈起我们曾经怎样和困难作过斗争，那么，请你务必也要记下她的名字。”
