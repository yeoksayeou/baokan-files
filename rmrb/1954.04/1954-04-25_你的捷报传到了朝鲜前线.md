To Comrade Wang Chonglun:

	During these three years and more of resisting America and aiding Korea, whether we were fighting, training, or building fortifications, we were always thinking about the motherland, thinking about the situation in all aspects of the motherland. How is industrial construction going? How many agricultural production cooperatives are there? Where has the new railway been built to? Has the people's life gotten better? ... Therefore, when we heard the news that you had completed more than four years of production tasks in one year, how excited we were! We celebrated your victory as if we were celebrating a battle victory, and your victory brought us tremendous encouragement.

	On the eve of the Spring Festival, a company on the front line read your deeds to the soldiers during the evening roll call. As soon as the roll call was over, the soldiers began to discuss it. Some comrades kept saying, "The workers are really great! Really great!" Some said, "This victory is not simple, it is no less than our annihilating hundreds of American devils." After Comrade Cui Fuquan heard about your deeds, he thought of his own work and felt that he had not done enough. To be honest, Cui Fuquan's past work was not bad. Since entering Korea, he has successively won three third-class merits, two for combat and one for rescuing a large number of materials transported from the motherland. Until now, the fingers on his hand that were burned while rescuing materials have not completely healed. But when he heard about your deeds, do you know what he thought? He thought, "Although I have fought and bled to defend the motherland, this is nothing! Who isn't fighting and working for the motherland? Look at Wang Chonglun, how beautifully he completed his task, he has already moved ahead of schedule!..." That night, he asked for the newspaper, carefully read the news over and over, thought about it again and again, and couldn't sleep the more he thought about it. He went out to stand guard in the middle of the night. The wind on the mountain was bone-chilling, and the snow was heavy, but his heart was warm. He thought, "The workers, peasant brothers, thousands of mothers and children, and Chairman Mao in the motherland have all been busy for a day, and now they need to rest quietly. We must not let the enemy disturb them again!"

	Dear comrade, I also want to tell you! A few days ago, I met a comrade from the railway troops who told me the same story. In early February, he went to the Datong River construction site. The weather was very cold that day, and the river surface was completely frozen. The wind blowing down the river was like a knife. The soldiers stood on the high scaffolding in the middle of the river, working nervously. At this moment, the good news of your victory on the production front reached the construction site. In an instant, cheers rang out throughout the construction site. The instructor picked up the loudspeaker and shouted, "Comrades! Comrade Wang Chonglun has completed more than four years of production tasks in one year, and we must also strive to complete the task ahead of schedule!" With this shout, the soldiers' emotions were even higher. The red-hot rivet heads in the stove were thrown out one after another, and then the rivet guns also rang out, shaking the scaffolding and steel beams. The soldiers standing by the stove had their cheeks flushed with sweat, but they were still working nervously. On this day, the soldiers overfulfilled the task by one and a half times, creating the highest record since the start of construction.

	Also, not long ago, a unit of the Volunteer Army stationed on the east coast of Korea was ordered to help the Korean people build a large brick kiln – this brick kiln can fire 800,000 bricks at a time. The soldiers knew how much the Korean people, who were restoring and rebuilding their motherland, needed such a brick kiln! They planned to strive to complete the construction task one month ahead of schedule. However, after your deeds spread there, the soldiers said, "No, we must also refuel and hurry up!" According to everyone's opinions, the original plan was revised again, and they wanted to strive to complete the task two months ahead of schedule. During the construction, many comrades' hands were frostbitten, and their feet were injured, but they still insisted on working. In the snowy weather, the Korean villagers repeatedly came to persuade them to rest, but they refused to go back. After thirty-three days of hard work, the large brick kiln was indeed completed two months ahead of schedule.

	Comrade Wang Chonglun, I can tell you many, many such stories. Your first victory report – this loud bugle call on the industrial front of the motherland – has flown across the Yalu River, spread throughout the fighting Korea, been recorded in the hearts of every Volunteer Army soldier, and has become a force to encourage us to move forward. Perhaps, when I am writing this letter to you, you are already doing the work of 1957. We believe that your second, third... victory reports will come one after another. The more we hear, the happier we will be, and the greater the strength to defend the security of the motherland and world peace will be. Regarding this point, please rest assured you and all the worker comrades in the motherland, as long as the enemy dares to take risks again, we will never spare him!

### 你的捷报传到了朝鲜前线

    你的捷报传到了朝鲜前线
    刘启光亲爱的王崇伦同志：
    抗美援朝这三年多来，我们不管是打仗也罢，练兵也罢，修工事也罢，时时刻刻在想着祖国，想着祖国各个方面的情况。工业建设得怎么样啦，农业生产合作社有多少啦，新铁路修到那里啦，人民的生活更好了吧……。因此，当我们听到了你一年完成四年多生产任务的消息时，心情该是多么兴奋啊！我们像欢庆作战胜利一样地来欢庆过你的胜利，你的胜利也给我们带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    春节的前一天，前沿阵地的一个连队在晚上点名时，指导员把你的事迹读给战士们听。刚点完名，战士们就议论开了。有的同志光一个劲地说：“工人同志们真行！真行！”有的说：“这个胜利可不简单哪，不亚于咱们歼灭几百个美国鬼子。”崔福全同志听了你的事迹后，他联想到自己的工作，感到自己做得还很不够。说实在的，崔福全过去的工作并不坏。入朝以来，他连续立了三次三等功，两次是战斗功，一次是为抢救祖国运来的大批物资而立功的。直到如今，他为抢救物资被火烧伤了的手指还没有完全好。可是当他听了你的事迹后，你知道他是怎么想的？他想：“我虽然为保卫祖国，打过仗，流过血，可这也算不了什么呀！谁还不是为祖国战斗着，工作着？看看人家王崇伦，任务完成得多漂亮，都已经赶到时间的前面去啦！……”当天晚上，他把报纸要来，仔细地把这个消息看了又看，想了又想，越想越睡不着。半夜里他出去站岗，山上的风冷得刺骨，雪下得很大，但是他的心是温暖的。他想：“祖国的工人同志们，农民兄弟们，千千万万的母亲和孩子们，还有毛主席，都已经忙碌一天了，现在他们需要安安静静地休息休息了。可不能让敌人再来扰乱他们！”
    亲爱的同志，我还要告诉你！前些天，我遇见了一位铁道部队的同志，他告诉我一个同样的故事。二月初，他到大同江工地上去。这天天气很冷，江面上全结了冰。顺江吹来的风，像刀子似的。战士们站在江心里高高的排架上紧张地工作着。就在这时，你在生产战线上的捷报，传到了工地上来。霎时间，整个工地就响起一片欢呼声。指导员拿起广播筒喊叫着：“同志们！王崇伦同志一年完成了四年多的生产任务，咱们也要争取提前完成任务呀！”这一喊，战士们的情绪更高昂了。火炉里通红的铆钉头，一个挨着一个地往外扔，接着，铆枪声也突突哒哒地响起来，震得脚手架和钢梁都直打颤。站在炉边的战士，脸颊都被烤得直冒汗珠，但他们仍在紧张地工作着。这一天，战士们超额一倍半完成了任务，创造了开工以来的最高纪录。
    还有，不久以前，驻在朝鲜东海岸的志愿军某部，奉命去帮助朝鲜人民修建一个大砖窑——这个砖窑一次能烧八十万块砖。战士们知道：正在恢复和重建自己祖国的朝鲜人民，是多么需要这样一个砖窑啊！他们计划着要争取提前一个月来完成修建任务。可是，你的事迹传到那里以后，战士们说：“不行啊，咱们也要加油，也要赶快点呀！”根据大家的意见，又修改了原定计划，要争取提前两个月完成任务。在施工中，很多同志的手冻裂了，脚砸伤了，还坚持工作。大雪纷飞的天气，朝鲜老乡们三番五次地来劝他们休息，可是他们怎么也不肯回去。经过三十三天的紧张劳动，这座大砖窑果然提前两个月完成了。
    王崇伦同志，像这样的故事，我能给你说很多，很多。你的第一个胜利的捷报——这是祖国工业战线上一声响亮的号角，已经飞过了鸭绿江，传遍了战斗的朝鲜，记在每一个志愿军战士的心里，而且成了鼓舞我们前进的力量。或许，我在给你写这封信的时候，你已经是在做一九五七年的工作了。我们相信你的第二个，第三个……捷报会一个个地传来。我们听到的越多，就越高兴，保卫祖国安全和世界和平的力量也就越大了。关于这一点，请你和祖国所有的工人同志放心吧，只要敌人敢再来冒险，我们决不会饶他的！
