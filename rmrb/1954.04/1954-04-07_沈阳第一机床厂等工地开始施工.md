Construction has successively begun at the construction site of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the construction site of Shenyang Smelter, the No. 219 construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, the No. 906 construction site of the Third Engineering Department of the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Shenyang Chemical Plant construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau.

To strive for the early commencement of the projects, the construction units that had already started work had been intensively preparing for construction beforehand. In order to ensure that the construction organization design was practical, engineering and technical personnel thoroughly collected information from various aspects such as geological drilling, water and electricity supply, material sources, and transportation. A large number of materials were also continuously transported to the site. To ensure project quality, the No. 219 construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau educated workers on operating procedures and quality standards before construction began. Some construction sites even mobilized employees to discuss work plans. The Hu Keqiang group at the No. 906 construction site proposed to complete the digging of the trenches four days ahead of schedule after discussing the plan. The bricklayer Gao Wenheng group at the No. 219 construction site proposed to complete the plan eighty-two and a half workdays ahead of schedule and ensure that the project quality reached 95%; to ensure the realization of this plan, they also formulated specific measures such as frequent stringing, frequent alignment, and frequent inspection.

At the commencement ceremonies, leaders of each construction site put forward specific requirements to all employees to ensure the implementation of "good, fast, economical, and safe," and the employees expressed their determination to respond to the call from higher authorities with practical actions. Xiao Yuling, a cement worker from the No. 906 construction site, represented the entire group of workers at the commencement ceremony and pledged: "After studying the General Line, we clearly recognize the significant responsibility of capital construction workers in realizing the country's socialist industrialization. We are determined to complete the annual construction plan ahead of schedule on the basis of ensuring project quality and report good news to Chairman Mao!"

At the construction site of No. 219, workers have begun the foundation bricklaying project. The Gao Wenheng group, composed of 45 workers organized according to advanced labor organization principles, used mortar spreaders to operate, laying 60,000 bricks on the first day with a quality rate of over 90%. The technical supervision section inspectors are also busy checking the bricklaying quality and testing the mortar mix ratio and the water absorption of the bricks.

    沈阳第一机床厂等工地开始施工
    沈阳第一机床厂工地、沈阳冶炼厂工地、市建筑工程局第二工程公司二一九工地、轻工业部第三工程处九○六工地、有色金属工业局第二工程公司沈阳化工厂工地已相继开始施工。
    为了争取工程早日开工，各已开工的施工单位在开工前都抓紧进行了施工准备。工程技术人员为保证施工组织设计切合实际，深入搜集了地质钻探、水电供应、材料来源和运输等各方面的资料。大批材料也都源源运进现场。为保证工程质量，市建筑工程局第二工程公司二一九工地在开工前向工人进行了操作规程和质量标准的教育。有些工地并发动职工讨论了作业计划。九○六工地胡克强小组讨论计划后，提出了要提前四天完成挖地槽任务。二一九工地砌砖工高文恒小组提出要提前八十二个半工完成计划，并保证工程质量达百分之九十五；为保证这个计划的实现，他们并制定勤拉线、勤校正、勤检查等具体措施。
    在开工典礼大会上，各工地领导上都向全体职工提出保证贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的具体要求，职工们也都纷纷表示一定要以实际行动来响应上级号召。九○六工地水泥工萧玉龄代表全组工人在开工典礼大会上提出保证说：“经过总路线学习，我们明确认识了基本建设工人在实现国家的社会主义工业化中的重大责任，我们决心在保证工程质量的基础上，提前完成全年建设计划，向毛主席报捷！”
    在二一九工地施工现场上，工人已开始进行基础砌砖工程，按先进劳动组织组成的高文恒小组四十五名工人使用铺灰器操作，第一天就砌了六万块，质量达百分之九十以上。技术监督科检查人员也紧张地检查砌砖质量，并对灰浆配合比、砖的吃水量进行了试验。
