    Between July 1953 and January of this year, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and infinite loyalty to the cause of peace, democracy, and unity in Germany, exposed the conspiratorial activities of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group and took correct measures to expel the anti-Party elements Herrnstadt and Zaisser from the Party. The other three alternate members of the Politburo, Ackermann, Jendretzky, and Schmidt, who committed errors of principle in the struggle against this anti-Party group, also received their due punishment. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany demonstrated Bolshevik consistency and firmness in handling this incident, and hundreds of Party activist conferences and Party congresses unanimously supported the Central Committee's measures. This demonstrates the maturity and strength of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and shows that the Party's unity is unshakable. This is a victory for the German people and also a victory for the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser group took place at a time when international reactionary groups were further dividing Germany, intensifying the revival of German militarist forces, and creating a fascist riot aimed at subverting the German Democratic Republic. During this period, the people of the German Democratic Republic united closely around the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to wage a resolute struggle to smash the enemy's conspiracies, defend the German Democratic Republic, and strive for the reunification of Germany. In order to fulfill the people's expectations, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany adopted a new policy on June 9, 1953, aimed at improving the lives of people of all strata, further consolidating the German Democratic Republic, and promoting reconciliation between the eastern and western parts of Germany, thereby restoring German unity; the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic announced several decrees on June 11 to implement the new policy. The implementation of this new policy alarmed and enraged foreign warmongers and the Adenauer ruling group, who realized that the new policy would greatly hinder them from realizing their sinful war plans and the Bonn war treaty. They brazenly launched a long-planned fascist provocation on June 17 in Berlin. However, the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Party, smashed this conspiracy of riots directly organized and directed by the reactionary groups of the United States and other Western countries.

    When the Party and the people were at a critical juncture of the struggle, the Herrnstadt-Zaisser group revealed their political faces as alien elements of the working class and individualistic careerists, and launched an attack on the Party by using their positions in the Party and the state. Under Herrnstadt's instigation, "Neues Deutschland" published a series of remarks slandering and splitting the Party. Zaisser, as Minister of Public Security, tried to establish his own independent kingdom and conspired to place the public security organs above the Party. After the Party and the government announced the new policy, especially after the riots in Berlin by foreign mercenaries, the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group became even more unscrupulous in slandering the Party's great historical achievements, arrogantly and openly demanding a change in the Party's leadership, seizing the Party's leadership, and even attempting to transform the Party under the despicable guise of so-called "renovation," causing the Party to degenerate and lose its Bolshevik leadership role, and finally attempting to destroy the Party. In this way, the Herrnstadt-Zaisser group actually stood with the deadly enemies of the Party and the German people—the imperialist groups and the fascist provocateurs—and they jointly endangered the cause of the Party and the people. The Party must ruthlessly expose this shameful factional anti-Party activity and cleanse them out in order to maintain the Party's unity and combat effectiveness, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the Party and the people's cause.

    The Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group resorted to the decadent and reactionary views of social democracy to support their anti-Party behavior. They despised the Party's leading role as the vanguard of the working class; they opposed the Party to the masses, believing that the Party should not be the most advanced and militant party of the working class. Therefore, when the Party had to undertake new combat tasks in the new situation, the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group completely exposed their ugly face as agents of imperialism in essence, and adopted a line of capitulationism and defeatism. They openly demanded that the Party be reorganized into a so-called "people's party representing all classes," and they attempted to transform the Party according to their own image. They even believed that the German Democratic Republic could be transformed into a bourgeois republic. Of course, their anti-Party and anti-people conspiracy could not succeed, so they wantonly slandered the Party, adopted a hostile attitude towards the Party's leading organs, and further attempted to seize the Party's leadership in order to achieve their despicable goals. The Herrnstadt-Zaisser group thus inevitably degenerated into pawns of imperialism.

    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany adopted a very prudent and uncompromising principled attitude in dealing with this anti-Party group incident. The 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee, held on July 24, 1953, condemned the anti-Party remarks of Herrnstadt and Zaisser, expelled them from the Central Committee, and decided to continue the investigation. The 17th Plenary Session of the Central Committee, held in January 1954, listened to Comrade Hermann Matern's report on the investigation results of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group, and after discussion, made the decision to expel the anti-Party elements Herrnstadt and Zaisser from the Party. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany also launched a struggle against the three alternate members of the Politburo, Ackermann, Jendretzky, and Schmidt. Initially, Ackermann actively supported the anti-Party arguments of Herrnstadt and Zaisser; later, when Herrnstadt and Zaisser bowed to the Central Committee, although Ackermann separated from them, he still insisted that all issues should be resolved only within the Politburo and not discussed and dealt with by the Central Committee, attempting to protect them from being expelled from the Party's leading organs. The Politburo rejected this serious loss of position and conciliatory argument, because it was not allowed by the principle of maintaining Party discipline and inner-Party democracy. Jendretzky and Schmidt initially supported Herrnstadt and Zaisser, especially Schmidt, who actively participated in the activities of this anti-Party group for a long time. At the plenary session of the Central Committee, they did not make a frank self-criticism of their erroneous attitude, but attempted to avoid expressing a clear position and downplayed their attitude, attempting to deceive the Central Committee. Based on this situation, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany decided to give Ackermann a serious warning and expel him from the Central Committee; Jendretzky and Schmidt received warnings, and they were not elected when new members of the Politburo were elected.

    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany defended the Party's unity as if protecting the apple of its eye, and cleared away anti-Party factional activities that could endanger the Party's life. This is of great significance for strengthening the Party and ensuring that the Party leads the people in consolidating the German Democratic Republic and striving to build a unified Germany with peace and democracy. This struggle powerfully struck at the various sinful conspiracies to sabotage the cause of German reunification, the German Democratic Republic, and its strong leadership—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Those international reactionary groups who are bent on making Germany a hotbed for launching new wars always try their best to find their agents within the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in order to create division and achieve their sinful goals in order to subvert the German Democratic Republic. However, the victory achieved by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the struggle against the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group greatly disappointed the enemies of the German people.

    Contrary to the unfounded slanders made by the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group against the Party, and contrary to what the enemies of the German people hoped for, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany inherited the fine revolutionary traditions of the German workers' movement and became the unshakable leading force of the people of the German Democratic Republic. Facts have proven that the decision made by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to implement the new policy was completely correct. This decision further consolidated the German Democratic Republic and greatly helped the struggle to strive for German reunification and for an internal agreement among the German people. In the current new situation, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its Fourth Congress, and for the future building of a unified Germany through peaceful and democratic means, uniting all peaceful forces against the revival of German militarism, and formulating the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic, it put forward new tasks. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic will surely achieve new and greater achievements under the leadership of the Party. The consolidation and development of the German Democratic Republic, and the achievements of the German people in their struggle for peace, unity, democracy, and socialism will be a great contribution to ensuring peace and security in Europe and the world.

    The struggle of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to expose and cleanse the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group provides us with beneficial political lessons. This struggle proves that the Party must constantly enhance its revolutionary vigilance, be vigilant against all conspiracies by hostile elements and individual careerists who have infiltrated the Party to usurp the Party's leadership, and be vigilant against any activities by agents of imperialism to split the Party. In order to consolidate the Bolshevik unity of the Party, the Party must redouble its efforts to strengthen collective leadership, promote inner-Party democracy, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and expose and prevent in a timely and effective manner any behavior that endangers the Party's unity, as well as any bad tendencies that allow such dangers to grow and spread. Only in this way can the imperialists and their lackeys be prevented from succeeding in their conspiracies to cause the people's revolutionary cause to fail and to block the people's progress; only in this way can it be guaranteed that the Party will be invincible in the face of any period and any task.

    德国统一社会党捍卫党的团结和统一的成就
    在一九五三年七月到今年一月间，德国统一社会党中央委员会以高度的革命警惕性和对德国和平、民主和统一事业的无限忠诚，揭发了海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的阴谋活动，并采取了正确的措施，将反党分子海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔两人清除出党。在反对这一反党集团的斗争中犯了原则错误的其他三名政治局候补委员阿克曼、颜德累茨基和史密特也受到应得的处分。德国统一社会党中央委员会在处理这一事件中，表现了布尔什维克的一致性和坚定性，数以百计的党活动分子会议及党员大会一致拥护中央的这个措施。这说明了德国统一社会党的成熟和强大，说明了党的团结和统一是不可动摇的。这是德国人民的一个胜利，也是世界和平民主和社会主义事业的一个胜利。
    海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔集团反党反人民的阴谋事件，发生在国际反动集团进一步分裂德国，加紧复活德国军国主义势力，并制造企图颠覆德意志民主共和国的法西斯暴动的时候。在这一时期内，德意志民主共和国人民紧密地团结在德国统一社会党的周围，为粉碎敌人的阴谋，捍卫德意志民主共和国，争取德国的统一而进行坚决的斗争。为了实现人民的期望，德国统一社会党中央政治局于一九五三年六月九日，通过了以提高各阶层人民的生活、进一步巩固德意志民主共和国、促进德国东西两部分之间的和解从而恢复德国的统一为目标的新方针；德意志民主共和国部长会议于六月十一日公布了执行新方针的几项法令。这个新方针的实行，使得外国战争贩子和阿登纳统治集团惊慌暴怒，他们认识到新方针将会大大地妨碍他们实现罪恶的战争计划和波恩战争条约，便悍然于六月十七日在柏林发动了蓄谋已久的法西斯挑衅事件。但是，德意志民主共和国政府和人民在党的领导下，粉碎了美国和其他西方国家的反动集团所直接组织和主持的这一暴动阴谋。
    当着党和人民处于重大斗争的关头，海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔集团显露了工人阶级异己分子和个人主义野心家的政治面目，利用他们在党和国家中的职务向党发起了进攻。在海恩斯塔特的主使下，
  “新德意志报”曾发表毁谤和分裂党的一系列的言论。蔡塞尔作为公安部部长，则力图建立他自己的独立王国，阴谋把公安部机构放在党之上。在党和政府宣布新方针之后，特别是柏林发生外国雇佣分子暴动事件以后，海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团更加肆无忌惮地诬蔑党的伟大历史性成就，狂妄地公开要求改变党的领导，夺取党的领导权，甚至在所谓“革新”党的卑鄙幌子下想使党蜕化变质，丧失布尔什维克的领导作用，最后企图毁灭党。这样，海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔集团实际上是与党和德国人民的死敌——帝国主义集团和法西斯挑衅分子站到一起去了，他们共同危害党和人民的事业。对于这种可耻的反党派别活动，党必须毫不容情地加以揭发，把他们清洗出去，以保持党的统一性和战斗性，从而保证党和人民事业的胜利。
    海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团搬弄了腐朽的社会民主主义的反动观点来支持他们的反党行为。他们藐视党作为工人阶级的先锋队的领导作用；他们把党和群众对立起来，认为党不应该是工人阶级中最先进的战斗政党。因此，当党必须在新的形势下担当起新的战斗任务的时候，海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团就彻底地暴露了他们实质上作为帝国主义的代理人的丑恶面目，采取了投降主义和失败主义的路线。他们公然要求将党改组成为所谓“代表一切阶级的人民政党”，他们企图按照他们自己的面目来改造党，他们竟然认为德意志民主共和国可能转变为资产阶级共和国。当然，他们的这种反党反人民的阴谋是不能得逞的，于是，他们就大肆诽谤党，对党的领导机关采取敌对态度，并进一步企图夺取党的领导权，以便实现其卑鄙的目的。海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔集团就这样不可避免地堕落成为帝国主义的走卒了。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会在处理这一反党集团的事件中，采取了十分慎重而又毫不妥协的原则性的态度。一九五三年七月二十四日举行的第十五次中央全会，谴责了海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔两人的反党言论，将两人开除出中央委员会，并决定继续进行调查。一九五四年一月举行的第十七次中央全会听取了赫尔曼·马特恩同志关于海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的调查结果的报告，经过讨论后，对反党分子海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔作出了开除出党的决定。同时，德国统一社会党中央委员会还对政治局候补委员阿克曼、颜德累茨基和史密特三人展开了斗争。起初阿克曼是积极支持了海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔的反党论点的；后来当海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔向中央委员会低头之后，阿克曼虽然和他们分开了，但仍坚持全部问题只在政治局内部解决而不要在中央委员会上讨论处理，企图以此保护他们不被驱逐出党的领导机构。政治局拒绝了这种严重的丧失立场和调和主义的论点，因为这是维护党的纪律和党内民主的原则所不能容许的。颜德累茨基和史密特两人最初也支持海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔，特别是史密特曾在较长时间内积极参与了这一反党集团的活动，他们在中央委员会全会上不是对自己的错误态度进行坦率的自我批评，而是企图避不表示明确的立场，对自己的态度轻描淡写，企图蒙混中央委员会。德国统一社会党中央委员会根据这一情况决定给予阿克曼以严重警告处分，并开除出中央委员会；颜德累茨基和史密特受到警告处分，在选举新的政治局委员的时候，他们都落选了。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会像爱护眼珠一样捍卫了党的统一，清除了足以危害党的生命的反党的派别活动。这对于增强党并保证党在领导人民巩固德意志民主共和国和争取建立和平民主统一的德国的事业中，具有重大的意义。这个斗争有力地打击了对于德国统一的事业、对于德意志民主共和国及其坚强的领导力量——德国统一社会党进行破坏的种种罪恶阴谋。那些一心要使德国重新成为它们发动新战争的温床的国际反动集团，为了颠覆德意志民主共和国，总是千方百计地企图在德国统一社会党内部找寻他们的代理人，以便制造分裂，达到其罪恶的目的。但是，德国统一社会党在和海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的斗争中所取得的胜利，却使德国人民的敌人大失所望了。
    与海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团对党所作的毫无根据的诽谤相反，与德国人民的敌人所希望的相反，德国统一社会党继承了德国工人运动的优良的革命传统，成了德意志民主共和国人民的不可动摇的领导力量。事实证明，德国统一社会党所作的关于实行新方针的决定，是完全正确的。这个决定使德意志民主共和国得到进一步的巩固，大大地有助于争取德国统一、争取德国人民内部协议的斗争。在当前新的形势下，德国统一社会党举行了第四次代表大会，为今后通过和平民主的途径建成一个统一的德国，联合一切和平力量反对德国军国主义复活，以及制订发展德意志民主共和国国民经济的第二个五年计划，提出了新的任务。德意志民主共和国政府和人民，必将在党的领导下取得新的更大的成就。德意志民主共和国的巩固和发展，德国人民为和平、统一、民主和社会主义而斗争的成就，对于保障欧洲及世界的和平安全将是莫大的贡献。
    德国统一社会党揭发和清洗海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的斗争，给我们提供了有益的政治教训。这一斗争证明：党必须经常提高革命警惕性，警惕混入党内的敌对分子和个人野心家企图篡夺党的领导的一切阴谋，警惕帝国主义的代理人分裂党的任何活动。为了巩固党的布尔什维克的团结和统一，党必须百倍加强集体领导，发扬党内民主，运用批评和自我批评的武器，及时而有效地揭发和防止任何足以危害党的团结和统一的行为，以及任何使这种危险得以滋长和传布的不良倾向。只有这样，才能使帝国主义者及其走狗企图使人民革命事业归于失败、阻挡人民前进的阴谋破坏活动无法得逞；只有这样，才能保证党在任何时期和任何任务面前都能无往不胜。
