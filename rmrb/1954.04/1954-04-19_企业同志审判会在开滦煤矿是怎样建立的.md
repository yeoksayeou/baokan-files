To gain experience in establishing Economic Construction Protection Tribunals and Enterprise Comrades' Trial Committees (hereinafter referred to as Comrades' Trial Committees) in urban industrial and mining areas, the central political and legal organs sent a judicial work team to Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan City, Hebei Province last year to conduct typical experiments. Now, the situation and some preliminary experiences of the judicial work team in establishing the Comrades' Trial Committee in Kailuan Coal Mine are reported as follows.

I. Combining with the Central Task, Learning Production Knowledge,
	Establishing Judicial Business
After the judicial work team went down to the mine, the first problem they encountered was: it was difficult to try cases related to production without understanding production knowledge. Ordinary workers also didn't quite understand whether the work the judicial work team was going to do was really beneficial to production. After repeated consideration, the judicial work team decided to learn production knowledge and establish judicial business by serving the mine's central task. Therefore, they requested the mine leaders to assign them some work: helping the mine write big-character posters, sorting out safety inspection records, and helping three model groups summarize model deeds. Later, they further participated in the mine's mass movements such as increasing production and practicing economy, labor emulation, wage reform, and major safety inspections.

Through the above work, the judicial work team preliminarily understood general production knowledge, such as the production process, labor organization, production management system and responsibility system, and factors that promote or hinder production; at the same time, it also won the support of the masses and the trust of cadres, creating favorable conditions for the establishment of the Comrades' Trial Committee. Workers reported to the judicial work team or consulted with them on production-related or personal life problems. The judicial work team also promptly mediated and resolved disputes between families or between workers, and tried their best to solve their difficulties in production.
II. Publicizing the Significance of the Comrades' Trial Committee,
	Discovering and Cultivating Activists
Since the Comrades' Trial Committee is a new organizational form, it is unfamiliar to both the workers and cadres. Therefore, when the judicial work team began to establish the Comrades' Trial Committee, it widely and deeply publicized the nature, scope of authority, and leadership relationship of the Comrades' Trial Committee in connection with the mine's central task. The publicity focused on: The Comrades' Trial Committee is a mass organization for self-education of workers. Its task is to deal with violations of labor discipline, minor liability accidents, and minor theft and injury incidents within the factory or mine. For workers who have committed the above-mentioned mistakes, if they still do not change after being criticized by the group meeting, and the degree of their mistakes has not reached the point where they should be sanctioned by law, they can be handed over to the Comrades' Trial Committee by the administrative leader for handling. The Comrades' Trial Committee is not a court. It does not have the power to convict, but can only give criticism and education to the person being tried, or order him to make a public self-criticism. If the mistakes committed by the person being tried are more serious, it can also suggest that the administrative leader give warnings, record demerits, demote, or even dismiss them. However, the Comrades' Trial Committee is also different from the criticism of the group. Its judgment is mandatory and must be obeyed. Therefore, the Comrades' Trial Committee is a good organizational form for the working masses to conduct self-education in the communist spirit. Through it, the political and ideological awareness of the working masses can be improved, their awareness of the legal system can be strengthened, and violations of labor discipline and other criminal behaviors can be reduced and prevented. The chairman and members of the Comrades' Trial Committee are elected by the congress of all employees or the representative meeting of industrial and mining enterprises.

The method of publicity was first to explain and clarify various issues related to the Comrades' Trial Committee to responsible cadres of party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations at all levels, such as the Kailuan Party Committee, Tangshan Mine Party Committee, the General Branch of the 72 Coal Mining District, and the General Branch of the Electrical and Mechanical Section, either at meetings convened by them or through individual talks, so that they could recognize that this organization is indeed beneficial to production. This is the key to smoothly carrying out the work. Secondly, cultivate mass activists into backbones who publicize to the broad masses of employees, and also cultivate them as candidates for the Comrades' Trial Committee. The judicial work team used the spare time of these activists after they came out of the mine or before the meeting, or visited them in their dormitories on their days off, so that they could understand the content of the publicity, and then let them publicize to the broad masses of workers. Facts have proved that this approach is very effective. Because these activists are in production with the workers, on the one hand, they are familiar with the workers' thinking, and on the other hand, they can use all spare time. For example, the time when workers go up and down the well and eat dry food, sometimes even at the production site, to repeatedly publicize to the workers. After the workers had a preliminary impression of the Comrades' Trial Committee through publicity, the judicial work team obtained the consent of the party, government, and labor union leaders of the mine, and used the workers' point-shift spare time activities to conduct expanded publicity by the general branch secretary, district chief, and labor union chairman in combination with vivid examples; at the same time, it also used big-character posters, blackboards, clappers, and broadcasts to cooperate. After such repeated publicity, most of the workers realized that the Comrades' Trial Committee is beneficial to production and to individuals, and expressed their welcome. The general reflection of the workers in the 72 Coal Mining District is: "It's great to establish the Comrades' Trial Committee. People like Zhao Dadan (named Zhao An, the squad leader, who died in an accident on June 13 last year due to violating operating procedures) must be controlled in the future. In the past, when accidents occurred, it was just passed. It won't work in the future." After the publicity, the attendance rate of the 7532 mining team increased from 85.8% in September to 88% in October, and then to more than 90% in November. This shows that the publicity of the Comrades' Trial Committee played a role in legal education among the employees.
III. Election of Members of the Comrades' Trial Committee
The qualifications of candidates for the Comrades' Trial Committee are: clear history, firm stand; fair handling of affairs, upright style; active in production, abiding by labor discipline, prestigious among the masses, and not holding too many concurrent positions. Based on these conditions, the judicial work team discovered and cultivated a group of activists in cooperation with various central tasks. After repeated deliberation by cadres and the masses, they were identified as candidates for members of the Comrades' Trial Committee. Then, the election was conducted under the personal guidance of the responsible cadres of the party, government, and labor union. Because the preparatory work before the election was sufficient, and democracy was fully promoted during the election, allowing employees to conduct detailed comparisons of candidates according to the conditions, the people elected were all qualified. The result of the election was that the 7532 mining team elected five members of the Comrades' Trial Committee, including one grassroots labor union member and four workers. The 7811 and 7643 two mining teams jointly elected eleven people, including one squad leader, five grassroots labor union members, and five workers. The Electrical and Mechanical Section elected ten people, including four grassroots labor union members, two party branch members, and four workers. They are all distributed in various spot shifts on the mining teams or in various types of work in the Electrical and Mechanical Section. According to the experience of the working group, in order to facilitate the handling of cadres' problems, it is best to have cadres from the unit to participate in the members of the Comrades' Trial Committee. At the same time, because a coal mining team generally only mines coal for several months before it is finished, employees may be dispersed to several other mining teams. At that time, the Comrades' Trial Committee established by the mining team will lose its function. Therefore, the Comrades' Trial Committee should be established by the coal mining area, that is, members of the Comrades' Trial Committee should be elected from each spot shift in each mining team, and when problems are encountered, they can be dealt with in meetings of employees in the same spot shift in the entire area. In this way, even if a few coal mining teams are closed, their basic organization will still exist, and only elections need to be held in the newly opened mining teams. As for the unit of election, the underground is based on the spot shift as the election unit, and the Electrical and Mechanical Section is elected by the grassroots labor union representative meeting.
IV. How to Convene the Comrades' Trial Committee
Before convening the Comrades' Trial Committee, the judicial work team assisted the labor union and the elected Comrades' Trial Committee to do a series of preparatory work: first, study the materials of workers who violated operating procedures or were seriously absent, and pick out one or several of the most prominent and repeatedly unrepentant people; then, investigate their history, the size of the mistakes, and the ideological roots of the mistakes from themselves, their families, relatives, neighbors, and colleagues; then, patiently persuade and educate them, and mobilize their families and neighbors to persuade them together, and finally determine the trial object. That is to say, the selected trial object should have four conditions: (1) The mistake committed is an internal problem of the working class, and it is not a criminal problem that must be sentenced; (2) The mistake committed is typical and repeatedly unrepentant; (3) The material has been verified and the ideological root of the mistake has been found; (4) After persuasion and education, the workers who made mistakes have generally made up their minds to correct their mistakes. These conditions are the guarantee for the Comrades' Trial Committee to receive good results, and also one of the guarantees that its judgment can be executed. Therefore, not only should this be done in pilot work, but also in regular work. For example, one of the trial objects selected by the judicial work team, Liu Dongxing, a worker in the 7643 mining team, was from a poor peasant background. He worked in Kailuan for fifteen years. In the past, he did everything, including eating, drinking, prostitution, gambling, and smoking opium. After liberation, he still often absented from work for no reason, and his food and clothing were difficult. Now he is forty-five years old and still can't get a wife. Since he was transferred to the 7643 mining team in July last year, by the end of September, he only worked twelve days out of eighty-four days, and absented from work for no reason for sixty-six days. He also often did not participate in the workers' group meeting. The labor union regarded him as a repeatedly unrepentant "dead corner," and the workers regarded him as a typical lazy person. He himself felt that he was alone anyway, and it didn't matter whether he went to work or not. He once said: "If I marry a wife, I won't absent from work." But no one wanted to marry this "unpromising" person. After the judicial work team and the labor union and the Comrades' Trial Committee learned about these circumstances, they held a symposium with his brother and neighbors to study the reasons for his absence and how to help him. Later, they talked to him several times, repeatedly explaining the different status of the working class in the new and old society with facts, the harm of laziness to the country and individuals, and pointed out the bright path for him. His brother and neighbors also helped persuade him. He was very moved, hated what he had done in the past, and was determined to be a hardworking worker. In order to effectively consolidate his determination, the judicial work team mobilized him to prepare to make a self-criticism at the Comrades' Trial Committee and to make a plan for repentance. During the mobilization, it was explained that this was not to struggle against him like treating reactionary elements, nor would he be sent to court, but only asked him to seriously correct his mistakes.

After selecting the trial object, the judicial work team submitted the materials and opinions on disposal to the party and government leading organs of the mine and the city for approval, helped the Comrades' Trial Committee to draft a written judgment, and did other preparatory work.

In November and December last year, Tangshan Mine held three Comrades' Trial Conferences, all using the spare time activities of the employees in the unit. In addition to trying Liu Dongxing, these three conferences also tried Yang Qingyin, a worker in the 7532 mining team who was seriously absent, Sun Guotang, a worker in the same mining team who violated labor discipline and disrespected leaders, and Tian Huilin, an apprentice in the Electrical and Mechanical Section who had always seriously violated operating procedures. The participants in the conference included all employees of the unit where the Comrades' Trial Committee was located, labor union cadres from other units, and some activists and backward elements among the employees. The responsible comrades of the party, government, labor union, and youth league of the mine and the responsible comrades of the city's People's Court, Labor Bureau, and Procuratorate were also invited to participate in the first Comrades' Trial Conference. Later, when the Electrical and Mechanical Section held the same conference, the family members of the people being tried and the family members of some other workers were also invited to participate. The procedure of the conference was: the chairman of the labor union reported the significance of the establishment of the Comrades' Trial Committee; the chairman of the Comrades' Trial Committee announced the facts of the errors of the workers being tried; the workers being tried made self-criticism; the employees present gave opinions to the workers being tried; the workers being tried expressed their acceptance of education and made a plan for correction; the ruling or judgment of the Comrades' Trial Committee was announced; the administrative负责人 of the mine expressed acceptance of the Comrades' Trial Committee's recommendation for disposal of the workers being tried (one person made a self-criticism, two people were given demerits, and one person was dismissed); the负责人 of the party and labor union spoke; the employees present spoke freely.

The three Comrades' Trial Conferences were held seriously and sincerely, making the people being tried sincerely convinced and showing the great power of mass-based education and transformation. For example, Sun Guotang, the person being tried, used to carry a heavy burden, fearing the struggle of the conference and fearing being sent to court, but when he participated in the first conference trying Yang Qingyin, he saw that the attitudes of the employees were very sincere, so he felt relieved and wanted to go on stage to make a self-criticism at that time. Later, he also said:
"That meeting was well held. People are a bit careless. Often educating them in this way can help me correct myself." Bai Baohuai, a worker in the 91 Coal Mining District, said: "This meeting is of great help to us. In the past, political classes and the implementation of the miner management system also had certain effects, but some people were still stubborn. The Comrades' Trial Committee can solve the problem." Many family members said that they would publicize to their husbands and sons, asking them to work hard and not violate labor discipline. The convening of the Comrades' Trial Committee also left a deep impression on the cadres.
V. Consolidating the Achievements of the Trial Work
Consolidating labor discipline is a long-term task. It is unrealistic to think that violating labor discipline will not happen again after a Comrades' Trial Conference is held, or to think that the backward workers being tried have completely transformed. Therefore, the Comrades' Trial Committee must regularly conduct publicity and education to employees to consolidate existing achievements. This is as important as doing a series of ideological work for the workers being tried before convening the Comrades' Trial Committee. The working group has helped the members of the Comrades' Trial Committee to clearly recognize that their future tasks are: (1) preparing to convene the Comrades' Trial Committee and continuing to educate the people being tried after the meeting; (2) publicizing policies and regulations related to production at any time to employees, such as the general line, production plan, security regulations, operating procedures, and labor discipline; (3) educating employees who are absent, late, early, and who have disputes; (4) preventing employees from fighting, embezzlement, theft, and other criminal behaviors at any time, and giving them persuasion and education in a timely manner.

According to the reports of the two Comrades' Trial Committees in the 72 Coal Mining District, in the thirty-four days from November 21 to December 24 last year, in addition to consolidating the achievements of the two Comrades' Trial Conferences, they also discovered 52 problems, including 17 cases of unjustified absence, 5 cases of violating security regulations, 9 cases of violating operating procedures, 11 cases of not being active in production, and 9 cases of disputes. Except for five or six cases that have not been resolved, the rest have been resolved.

In consolidating the achievements of the two Comrades' Trial Conferences, they designated special personnel to continue to educate the objects who had been tried, encouraged them to make progress, solved their difficulties, and strictly criticized their recidivism. The results were very good. Liu Dongxing has truly achieved 100% attendance in the past three months, often participates in group meetings, and is in a good mood for production and learning. The other workers who have been tried have also made great progress. In addition, the Comrades' Trial Committee also carried out publicity on implementing security regulations and operating procedures, and carried out persuasion and education for workers who were absent without reason in order to consolidate the attendance rate.

    企业同志审判会在开滦煤矿是怎样建立的
    王汝琪
    中央政法机关为了取得在城市工矿地区建立经济建设保护庭和企业同志审判会（以下简称同志审判会）的经验，去年派司法工作组到河北省唐山市开滦煤矿进行典型试验。现在把司法工作组在开滦煤矿建立同志审判会的情况和一些初步经验报道如下。
    一、结合中心，学习生产常识，
      建立司法业务
    司法工作组下矿后，首先遇到的问题是：不懂生产常识，很难审理有关生产的案件。一般职工也不很了解司法工作组要做的工作是否对生产确实有利。司法工作组经过反复考虑，决定通过为矿上中心工作服务去学习生产常识，建立司法业务。因此就请求该矿领导上给分配了一些工作：帮助矿上写大字报，整理安全检查记录，帮助三个模范小组总结模范事迹。以后又进一步参加了该矿的增产节约、劳动竞赛、工资改革、安全大检查等群众运动。
    通过以上工作，司法工作组初步懂得了一般的生产常识，如生产过程、劳动组织情况、生产管理制度和责任制以及推进或障碍生产的因素等；同时也获得了群众的拥护和干部的信任，为建立同志审判会创造了有利的条件。工人们无论遇到有关生产的或个人的生活问题，都向司法工作组反映或找司法工作组商量。司法工作组也及时为他们调解解决家庭间或工人彼此间的纠纷，并尽可能为他们解决生产上的困难。
  二、宣传同志审判会的意义，
        发现与培养积极分子
    由于同志审判会是一种新的组织形式，对于职工群众和干部都很生疏，所以司法工作组在着手建立同志审判会时，即结合该矿的中心工作，广泛深入地宣传了同志审判会的性质、职权范围与领导关系等。在宣传中着重说明：同志审判会是职工群众自我教育的群众性的组织，它的任务是处理厂矿内部的违反劳动纪律事件，轻微的责任事故、轻微的盗窃与伤害事件等。对于犯有上述错误的职工，如经小组会提出批评仍然不改，而其错误程度又尚未达到应受法律制裁的地步时，可由行政领导人交同志审判会处理。同志审判会不是法院，它没有判罪的权力，只能给被审判者以批评教育，或令其公开检讨。如被审判者所犯错误较为严重，也可以建议行政领导上给予警告、记过、降职以至开除等处分。但同志审判会也与小组的批评不同，它的判决是有强制性的，必须服从。因此，同志审判会是职工群众用共产主义精神进行自我教育的良好组织形式，通过它可以提高职工群众的政治思想觉悟，加强他们的法制观念，减少和防止违反劳动纪律的事件和其他犯罪行为。同志审判委员会的主席和委员，由工矿企业的全体职工大会或代表会选举产生。
    宣传的方法，首先是在开滦党委、唐山矿党委、七二采煤区总支、机电科总支等各级党组织所召开的党、政、工、团负责干部会议上，或利用个别谈话的机会，向他们作有关同志审判会的各种问题的解释和说明，使他们认识这一组织确实对生产有利。这是顺利开展工作的关键。其次，是把群众积极分子培养成向广大职工群众进行宣传的骨干，同时也把他们作为同志审判委员会的候选人来培养。司法工作组利用这些积极分子上井后或开会前的空闲时间和他们谈话，或在他们轮流休息的日子到工房去访问他们，使他们领会宣传的内容，然后就放手让他们向广大职工进行宣传。事实证明这种作法的效果是很好的。因为这些积极分子和工人们在一起生产，一方面熟悉工人们的思想情况，另方面可以利用一切空闲时间。例如工人上下井和吃干粮的时间，有时甚至在生产现场，反复地向工人宣传。经过宣传使工人群众对于同志审判会有了初步印象时，司法工作组就取得矿上党、政、工会领导干部的同意，又利用工人点班业余活动时间，由总支书记、区长和工会主席结合生动的实例作扩大宣传；同时还以大字报、黑板报、快板、广播等方式配合。经过这样反复宣传，工人们大多数都认识了同志审判会对生产、对个人都有利，表示欢迎。七二采煤区工人们的普遍反映是：“成立同志审判会可好了，像赵大胆（名赵安，班长，去年六月十三日因违反操作规程发生事故致死。）那样的人，今后都得管管。过去发生了事故，一说就过去，以后可不行了。”经过宣传，七五三二礃工人的出勤率由九月份的百分之八十五点八增至十月份的百分之八十八，十一月份又增至百分之九十以上。这说明同志审判会的宣传在职工中起了法律教育的作用。
  三、选举同志审判委员会委员
    同志审判委员会候选人的条件是：历史清楚，立场坚定；办事公正，作风正派；生产积极，遵守劳动纪律，在群众中有威信，且兼职不多。司法工作组根据这些条件，在配合各种中心工作中，发现与培养了一批积极分子，经干部与群众反复酝酿后，确定为同志审判委员会的委员候选人。然后在党、政、工会等负责干部的亲自主持下进行选举。由于选举前的准备工作做得充分，选举时又充分发扬了民主，让职工们按条件对候选人进行详细评比，因而当选的人都是合乎条件的。选举的结果是七五三二礃选出同志审判委员会委员五人，其中工会基层委员一人、工人四人。七八一一和七六四三两礃共同选出十一人，其中班长一人、工会基层委员五人，工人五人。机电科选出十人，其中工会基层委员四人、党支部委员二人，工人四人。他们都分布在礃子上的各个点班或机电科的各工种中。根据工作组的经验，为了便于处理干部的问题，同志审判委员会的委员中最好有所在单位的干部参加。同时由于一个采煤礃一般只开采数月就采完了煤，职工可能分散到其他几个礃子上去，那时候以礃子为单位建立的同志审判会就会失去作用，所以应该以采煤区为单位建立同志审判会，即在每个礃子上的每个点班都选出同志审判委员会委员，遇到问题可以全区的同一点班职工的会议为单位进行处理。这么一来，纵令少数采煤礃结束了，其基本组织还存在，只须在新开辟的礃子上补行选举就行了。至于选举的单位，井下是以点班为选举单位，机电科的则是由工会基层代表会中选出。
  四、怎样召开同志审判会
    在召开同志审判会前，司法工作组协助工会和已选出的同志审判委员会做了一系列的准备工作：首先将违反操作规程或严重缺勤的工人的材料加以研究，从中挑出一个或几个最突出的、屡教不改的人；然后向其本人、家庭、亲属、邻居、同事调查其历史、错误大小及造成错误的思想根源；然后向本人进行耐心的说服教育，并动员其家属与邻居共同向他进行说服，最后才确定为审判对象。这就是说，被选作审判对象的，应具备四个条件：（一）所犯错误是工人阶级内部的问题，并且不是必须判刑的犯法问题；（二）所犯错误是典型的，又是屡教不改的；（三）材料经过对证，找到了犯错误的思想根源；（四）经说服教育后，犯错误的工人大体有了改正错误的决心。这些条件是使同志审判会收到良好效果的保证，也是使其判决能被执行的保证之一。所以不仅在试点工作中应这样做，在经常工作中也应该这样做。例如司法工作组所选择的一个审判对象，七六四三礃的工人刘东兴，是贫农出身，在开滦做工十五年，过去吃喝嫖赌抽白面，无所不为，解放后仍经常无故不上班，衣食困难，现在四十五岁了还娶不上老婆。自去年七月调到七六四三礃工作后，到九月底止，在八十四天中只上班十二天，无故脱班六十六天，还经常不参加工人的小组会。工会把他看作屡教不改的“死角”，工人们把他看成是好吃懒做的典型。他自己觉得反正孤身一人，上班不上班没关系。他曾表示：“要是娶上个老婆，我就不脱班了。”但没有人愿意和这个“没出息”的人结婚。司法工作组和工会及同志审判委员会了解了这些情况后，找他哥哥和邻居们开了个座谈会，研究他脱班的原因和帮助他的办法。以后又几次和他谈话，用事实反复说明了工人阶级在新旧社会的不同地位，懒惰对于国家和个人的危害，并给他指出了光明的道路。他的哥哥和邻居也都帮助劝说。他非常感动，痛恨自己过去的所做所为，决心要做个勤劳生产的工人。为了有效地巩固他的这种决心，司法工作组就动员他准备在同志审判会上作检讨，并订立悔改计划。动员中说明这不是像对待反动分子似的斗争他，同时也不会送他进法院，只是要求他认真改正错误。
    选择好审判对象后，司法工作组把材料及处分意见呈请矿上及市的党政领导机关批准，帮助同志审判委员会拟好了书面判决书，并做好了其他准备工作。
    去年十一、十二月，唐山矿举行过三次同志审判大会，都是利用所在单位职工点班业余活动时间。这三次大会除审判了刘东兴外，还审判了严重缺勤的七五三二礃的工人杨庆银，同礃违反劳动纪律、不尊重领导的工人孙国堂，一贯严重违反操作规程的机电科学徒田惠林。参加大会的有同志审判会所在单位的全体职工，其他单位的工会干部，职工中的部分积极分子和落后分子。召开第一次同志审判会时，还邀请了矿上的党、政、工、团负责同志及市人民法院、市劳动局、市检察署等机关的负责同志参加。以后机电科召开同样的大会时，又邀请了被审判者的家属及另一些工人的家属参加。大会的程序是：工会主席报告成立同志审判会的意义；同志审判会主席宣布被审判工人的错误事实；被审判工人检讨；到会的职工群众给被审判工人提意见；被审判工人表示接受教育并订出改正计划；宣布同志审判会的裁定或判决；矿上的行政负责人表示接受同志审判会关于被审判工人的处分建议（四人中一人检讨，二人记过、一人撤职）；党、工会负责人讲话；到会职工自由讲话。
    三次同志审判大会都开得严肃而诚挚，做到了被审判人心悦诚服，显示了群众性的感化教育的巨大力量。如被审判人孙国堂过去背着很大的包袱，怕大会斗争，怕送法院，但在参加审判杨庆银的第一次大会时，看见职工们的态度都是很诚恳的，就放了心，当时就要上台去检讨。以后他还表示：
  “那个会开得好，人都有点马虎劲儿，常常这样教育一下，就可以帮助我改正。”九一采煤区工人白宝怀说：“这个会对我们的帮助大，过去上政治课，实行矿工管理制度，虽然也收到一定的效果，但有些人仍是软磨硬抗，有了同志审判会可就解决问题了。”许多家属都表示要向自己的丈夫、儿子们宣传，要他们好好地工作，不要违反劳动纪律。同志审判会的召开在干部中也留下了深刻的印象。
  五、巩固审判工作成果
    巩固劳动纪律是一个长期的工作。如果以为召开一次同志审判会，就不会再发生违反劳动纪律的事情，或者以为被审判的落后工人就完全转变了，这种看法是不现实的。因此同志审判会必须经常地向职工进行宣传教育，巩固已有的成绩。这和在召开同志审判会前对于被审判的工人进行一系列的思想工作是同等重要的。工作组曾帮助同志审判会的委员明确地认识到他们今后的任务是：（一）筹备召开同志审判会，并在会后继续对被审判人进行教育；（二）随时向职工宣传总路线、生产计划、保安规程、操作规程及劳动纪律等有关生产的政策法令；（三）对于缺勤、迟到早退及发生纠纷的职工进行教育；（四）随时防止职工发生殴打以及贪污、盗窃等犯罪行为，并及时给予说服教育。
    据七二采煤区两个同志审判委员会的汇报，他们在去年十一月二十一日至十二月二十四日的三十四天内，除巩固了两次同志审判会审判的成果外，还发现问题五十二件，其中有无故脱班的十七件，违反保安规程的五件，违反操作规程的九件，生产不积极的十一件，闹纠纷的九件。除五、六件尚未解决外，其余都已解决。
    他们在巩固两次同志审判会的审判成果上，是指定专人对被审判过的对象继续进行教育，鼓励他们进步，解决他们的困难，严格批判他们的重犯，结果收效都很好。刘东兴三个月来真正做到了出勤百分之百，经常参加小组会，生产和学习的情绪都很好。其他几个被审判过的工人也都有很大的进步。此外同志审判委员会还进行了贯彻保安规程和操作规程的宣传，遇有无故脱班的工人就进行说服教育，以巩固出勤率。
