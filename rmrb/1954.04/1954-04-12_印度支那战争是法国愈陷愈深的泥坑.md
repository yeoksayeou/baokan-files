The Indochina War is becoming an ever-deepening quagmire for France. At the beginning of the war of aggression against Vietnam launched by France in 1946, the first commander-in-chief of the French army in this war of aggression, Leclerc, once arrogantly clamored: "The Viet Minh army can be defeated in three months." Now, more than seven years have passed, the Vietnam People's Army has become stronger and stronger in battle, and France has suffered losses of troops and generals, changed commanders six times, and suffered repeated defeats. Even the current seventh commander-in-chief of the French invading army, Navarre, admitted in February this year: "We never expect to inflict a decisive defeat on the enemy next year." This Navarre, with strong support from the United States last year, formulated a military plan, originally saying that he would "reverse" the trend of the Indochina War before May next year.

France is waging an unpopular colonial war in Indochina, which destined it to fail. Since the French colonialists launched the war, they have invested a large number of troops. When the fifth commander-in-chief of the French invading army, de Lattre de Tassigny, was in office (September 1951), he revealed that France "has always maintained more than half of its professional soldiers and more than a quarter of its officers in Indochina." This number has increased since then. However, such a huge force has not been able to conquer the people of Indochina who are unwilling to be enslaved by imperialism; on the contrary, it has encountered increasingly strong counterattacks from the local people's armed forces and suffered heavy losses. In the Vietnamese battlefield alone, from December 19, 1946, when France launched a full-scale war of aggression against Vietnam, to November 20 last year, more than 320,000 French troops (including the Bảo Đại puppet army) have been annihilated. The losses of the French army are also increasing year by year: in the first three or four years of the war, the average monthly loss was more than 2,400, increasing to more than 4,700 in 1951, more than 5,100 in 1952, and more than 6,100 last year. This year, in the first half of March alone, the French army lost 6,700 men. What particularly worries the French colonialists is the loss of French officers who serve as the backbone of the colonial army. French officials admit that the number of French officers killed or wounded in Indochina each year is more than the number trained by the French Saint-Cyr Military Academy each year.

France had high hopes for the "Navarre Plan," which was supported by the United States with hundreds of millions of dollars and a large number of munitions. The propaganda organs of France and the United States have extensively promoted this plan. Navarre has indeed made great efforts to rely on the massive "aid" from the United States to reverse the situation. He dropped paratroopers in Lạng Sơn, launched the "Black Carp Battle" in the area north of Lục Nam, and then launched the "Seagull Battle" southwest of Ninh Bình. However, Navarre lost every battle. From the time he took office last May to the end of last year, he lost 44,000 soldiers. This year, under the urging and intensified support of the United States, Navarre made new efforts, but suffered even more disastrous failures. He sent troops to parachute into Điện Biên Phủ, not only failing to hold Lai Châu, which he originally intended to support with this move, and threatening the People's Army from the flank, but trapping one-fifth of his mobile force—thirteen battalions—in Điện Biên Phủ, an isolated stronghold; the result of his sending mobile troops to launch the "Atlantis Battle" in the Tuy Hòa area was the loss of Kon Tum Province. The people's armed forces of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are mobile and flexible, coordinating and cooperating with each other, liberating large areas of land, making Navarre exhausted and beaten everywhere. He had to publicly admit: "We cannot hold everywhere." The actual result of Navarre's wishful thinking of concentrating forces and launching mobile attacks is to disperse and trap most of the forces in a few important strongholds, not only losing large areas of the "surface," but also making the remaining "points" and "lines" feel increasingly dangerous. Taking Điện Biên Phủ as an example, about 130 American transport planes used to transport 300 to 400 tons of American weapons and other supplies to strengthen this stronghold every day. However, American "aid" could not withstand the growing offensive power of the Vietnam People's Army. In just four days of fighting, the French defense line in the northern part of Điện Biên Phủ, supported by American planes, artillery, and tanks, was destroyed; in another four days of fighting, the eastern defense line of Điện Biên Phủ was also severely hit. The transportation lines of the French army in Indochina have been fragmented, and even the highway and railway transportation between Hanoi and Haiphong, which are heavily defended, are in a semi-paralyzed state. Airfields are no longer safe either. From the end of January to the beginning of March, the Đồ Sơn, Gia Lâm, and Cát Bi airfields near Haiphong and Hanoi were attacked one after another, and a total of 83 aircraft were destroyed. This situation increased the difficulty of transporting American "aid" materials. The French weekly "Today's Observer" pointed out when commenting on the implementation of the "Navarre Plan": "The current campaign...has greatly expanded the area controlled by the People's Army and strengthened the guerrilla warfare in the areas occupied by the (French) Expeditionary Force. On the other hand, it has promoted the collapse of the puppet regimes in Luang Prabang and Da Lat."

The Indochina War has also brought a heavy financial burden to France and deepened France's economic crisis. French Radical Socialist Party member of parliament Mendès France pointed out in October last year: "The Indochina War has cost France 10 billion US dollars in seven years." In 1953 alone, France spent 600 billion francs (350 francs equals one US dollar). The increase in France's fiscal deficit, the severity of inflation, and the continuous rise in prices are all inseparable from the huge consumption of the Indochina War. According to French press statistics, the war expenses that France spends in Indochina every day can build 1,500 houses or a hospital, and five days of war expenses are enough to give every factory and government agency worker a monthly salary increase of 5,000 francs. Although American "aid" has been increasing sharply in recent years, as the war intensifies, the overall military expenditure is also increasing, which is still a heavy burden on French finances.

However, this costly war has made a small number of monopoly capitalists in France who make a fortune from war and colonialism, especially a small group of French monopoly capital groups headed by the Banque de l'Indochine, reap huge profits. The profits of 45 French companies in Indochina, including the Banque de l'Indochine, in 1951 were 18.6 times those in 1946. By 1952, the profits of five major French companies, including the Banque de l'Indochine, had increased by 20% to 52% compared with 1951. This small group of monopoly capitalists can also receive huge "war loss compensation" from the government, reaching 150 billion to 200 billion francs by October 1952 alone. At the same time, they also engage in large-scale speculative transactions in the purchase of Indochinese currency, causing the French treasury to lose more than 100 billion francs each year. These high profits make them unwilling to stop the Indochina War, even if it means selling France's interests to rely on the United States in order to carry out this war.

On the other hand, the United States has been coveting Indochina's abundant resources and important strategic location. Former US Secretary of Defense Lovett once said: "The strategic and geographical location of the Vietnam region, as well as the very important raw materials it supplies, such as tin and rubber, make it necessary for us to continue to support the French government with effective action." US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles have also kept the wealth and strategic position of Indochina in mind in their public speeches. After the Korean War armistice, the United States stepped up its intervention in the Indochina War to curb the tendency of the situation in the Far East to ease. According to Eisenhower, after the Korean War armistice, Indochina has become the "center" for the United States to pursue its policy of aggression in Asia. Former French Prime Minister Daladier revealed that, according to the letters exchanged between the United States and France at the end of 1953, the exchange condition for the United States to give France 385 million US dollars in "additional aid" was that France could not "freely negotiate" with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Through "aid," American monopoly capital is constantly infiltrating Indochina. American monopoly capital has already controlled 72% of Indochina's non-ferrous metal exports. It is no wonder that the American "New York Herald Tribune" said: "From the very deep meaning of American interests, this war (the Indochina War) is precisely our war." Now, the Eisenhower government is interfering in this war step by step, and is trying to expand the scope of the war through so-called "joint action" in order to take over this rich colony from France.

This is why this war is still going on.

The French public is increasingly aware that the Indochina War is contrary to France's national interests, and they cannot tolerate making major sacrifices for the interests of a small group of French monopoly groups and the United States. The movement demanding an end to the Indochina War has developed on a broad scale in France, and a large number of bourgeois figures have also been involved in this movement. In the French National Assembly, in 1948, in addition to the French Communist Party members who have always advocated an end to the Indochina War, only five members voted against this war. By October 1953, the number of non-Communist members voting against it increased to 151, and it increased further to 176 in March this year. The Paris "Liberation" wrote: "French public opinion is now unified, and everyone hopes to end the Indochina War." The way out for France is: "Negotiations must be held."

    印度支那战争是法国愈陷愈深的泥坑
    南敏
    印度支那战争已经成为使法国愈陷愈深的泥坑。在一九四六年法国发动侵略越南的战争之初，第一任指挥这个侵略战争的法军总司令勒克莱克曾经狂妄地叫嚣：“三个月可以打垮越盟军”。现在七年多的时间过去了，越南人民军愈战愈强，法国损兵折将，六易统帅，节节败退。甚至目前的第七任法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔在今年二月间也承认：“我们决不指望在明年能使敌军遭到决定性的失败”。这个纳瓦尔去年曾在美国的大力支持下制定了一个军事计划，当初说要在明年五月以前“扭转”印度支那战争的趋势。
    法国在印度支那进行的是一场不得人心的殖民战争，这就注定了它的失败的命运。法国殖民主义者发动战争以来，投入了大批的兵力。第五任法国侵略军总司令塔西尼在任时（一九五一年九月）曾透露，法国“一直在印度支那保持着它一半以上的职业士兵，四分之一以上的军官”。这个数字后来是有增无减。但是，这样庞大的部队并没有能够征服不甘心遭受帝国主义奴役的印度支那的人民；相反地，它遭到了当地人民武装日益强烈的反击，损失惨重。仅在越南战场，从法国发动全面侵越战争的一九四六年十二月十九日到去年十一月二十日，法军（包括保大伪军）已被歼灭三十二万人以上。法军的损失并且是在年年增加：在战争初期的三、四年间，平均每月损失二千四百多名，到一九五一年增加到四千七百多名，一九五二年又增加到五千一百多名，去年再增加到六千一百多名，到了今年，仅三月上半月法军就损失六千七百名。其中特别使法国殖民主义者焦虑不安的是作为殖民军骨干的法国军官的损失。法国官方人士都承认，法国每年在印度支那伤亡的军官，比法国圣西尔军校每年训练出来的还要多。
    法国曾对美国用成亿美元和大批军火来支持的“纳瓦尔计划”抱着很大的希望。法国和美国的宣传机关都曾为这个计划大事宣传。纳瓦尔的确也作了重大努力，想依靠美国的大量“援助”来挽回局势。他在谅山降下了伞兵，在禄江以北地区发动“黑鲤战”，接着又在宁平西南发动“海鸥战”。但是，纳瓦尔战无不败。从他去年五月上任到去年年底为止，他就损失了兵员四万四千名。今年，在美国的督促和加紧支持之下，纳瓦尔作了新的努力，但遭到的是更惨重的失败。他派兵空降奠边府，不仅没有达到守住原来打算借此予以支援的莱州并从侧翼威胁人民军的目的，反而在奠边府这个孤立据点困住了自己五分之一的机动兵力——十三个营；他派遣机动部队在绥和地区发动“阿特朗特战”的结果，丢了崑嵩省。越南、高棉、寮国的人民武装机动灵活，相互呼应配合，解放了大片的土地，使纳瓦尔疲于奔命，到处挨打。他不得不公开承认：“我们不能守住一切地方”。纳瓦尔的集中兵力、机动出击的如意算盘的实际结果是把大部分力量分散困守在少数重要据点，不但丢失了大片的“面”，并且剩下的“点”和“线”也越来越感到危险了。以奠边府为例，曾经每天有一百三十架左右的美国运输机运送三四百吨的美国武器等供应品加强这个据点。但是，美“援”抵挡不了增长中的越南人民军的攻坚力量，仅在四天的战斗中，在美国飞机、大炮和坦克支援下的奠边府北部法军防线就被摧毁了；在另外的四天战斗中，奠边府的东部防线又遭到沉重打击。法军在印度支那的交通线已呈支离中断的现象，甚至重兵防守的河内与海防之间的公路和铁路运输都陷于半瘫痪状态。飞机场也不再安稳了，从一月底到三月初，海防和河内附近的涂山、嘉林、吉碑机场先后被袭，总共被炸毁飞机八十三架。这种情况增加了美“援”物资运输的困难。法国“今天观察家”周刊在评述“纳瓦尔计划”执行的情形时指出：“目前的战役……已经大大扩大了人民军控制的区域，加强了（法国）远征军占领区域里的游击战。另一方面它促使琅勃剌邦和大叻的傀儡政权瓦解。”
    印度支那战争也给法国带来了沉重的财政上的负担，加深了法国的经济危机。法国激进社会党议员孟戴斯—弗朗斯去年十月间指出：“印度支那战争在七年内已耗费了法国一百亿美元”。仅在一九五三年，法国就耗费了六千亿法郎（三百五十法郎合一美元）。法国财政赤字的增加、通货膨胀的严重、物价的不断上涨，都是和印度支那战争的巨额消耗分不开的。据法国报刊统计，法国每天用在印度支那的战费可以建筑一千五百所住宅或一所医院，五天的战费足够用来给每一个工厂和政府机关的工作人员每月增加五千法郎的工资。虽然近年来美国的“援助”在急剧增加，但是，随着战争的剧烈化，整个军费也在增加，仍旧是法国财政上的沉重负担。
    但是，这个劳民伤财的战争却使得法国的靠战争和殖民发财的少数垄断资本其中首先是以东方汇理银行为首的一小撮法国垄断资本集团，利市百倍。东方汇理银行等四十五家在印度支那的法国公司，一九五一年所得的利润为一九四六年的十八点六倍。到一九五二年，东方汇理银行等五家法国大公司的利润又比一九五一年增加百分之二十到五十二。这一小撮垄断资本还能够向政府领取巨额的“战争损失赔偿”，仅到一九五二年十月就达一千五百亿到二千亿法郎。同时，他们还从事大规模套购印度支那币的投机买卖，每年使法国国库损失一千亿法郎以上。这种高额的利润，使他们不愿停止印度支那战争，即使为了进行这个战争而出卖法国的权益去投靠美国也在所不惜。
    另一方面，美国一直在垂涎印度支那的丰富资源和重要的战略地位。前美国国防部长罗维特曾说：“越南这个区域的战略和地理位置，以及它所供应的甚为重要的原料，例如锡和橡胶等，使我们必须继续以有效的行动支持法国政府”。美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯在公开的演说中也念念不忘印度支那的财富和战略地位。朝鲜停战以后，美国更加紧插手印度支那战争，以遏止远东紧张局势趋向缓和。按照艾森豪威尔的说法，在朝鲜停战后，印度支那已变为美国推行侵略亚洲政策的“中心”。前法国总理达拉第揭露，根据美法两国在一九五三年末所交换的函件，美国给法国三亿八千五百万美元的“额外援助”的交换条件是：法国不能和越南民主共和国“自由地进行谈判”。通过“援助”，美国垄断资本正在不断渗入印度支那。美国垄断资本已经控制了印度支那有色金属出口的百分之七十二。难怪美国“纽约先驱论坛报”要说：“从美国利益这一极深的意义说来，这个战争（印度支那战争）正是我们的战争。”现在，艾森豪威尔政府正一步紧一步地干涉这个战争，并企图通过所谓“联合行动”来扩大战争的范围，以便从法国手中接收这一块富饶的殖民地。
    这就是为什么这个战争还在进行的原因。
    法国公众日益看清印度支那战争是违反法国的民族利益的，他们不能容忍为一小撮法国垄断集团和美国的利益而作出重大的牺牲。要求停止印度支那战争的运动已在法国规模广阔地发展起来，很大一部分的资产阶级人士也卷入了这个运动。在法国国民议会中，一九四八年的时候，除了一贯主张停止印度支那战争的法国共产党议员以外，仅有五个议员投票反对这个战争，到一九五三年十月投票反对的非共产党议员增加到一百五十一人，到今年三月更增加到一百七十六人。巴黎“解放报”写道：“法国舆论现在已经一致了，大家都希望结束印度支那战争。”法国的出路是：“必须进行谈判”。
