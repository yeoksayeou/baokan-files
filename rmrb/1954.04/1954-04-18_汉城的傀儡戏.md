On the eve of the Geneva Conference, the Lee Seung-man puppet troupe was working frantically. Under the direction of American string-pullers, Lee Seung-man is once again shouting about "marching north" and "unifying Korea"... According to International News Service reports: Lee Seung-man said on March 23 that "the Geneva Conference must not unify Korea, and he demanded that the United States provide weapons, air force and naval support so that South Korean infantry can advance north if the conference fails."

However, this is not the most "brilliant" program. According to a United Press Seoul dispatch: Choi Deok-shin, who recently represented Lee Seung-man on a "visit" to Southeast Asian countries, said that a conference to discuss Lee Seung-man's proposal for "forming an anti-communist alliance among Asian countries will be held in Seoul on April 26 (the opening day of the Geneva Conference - Author)," and representatives of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, the Philippines, and the three puppet regimes in Indochina have been invited.

Of course, this puppet show to be staged in Seoul will not have many spectators, let alone applause. People only need to hear the names of characters like Lee Seung-man, Chiang Kai-shek, Magsaysay, and Bao Dai. But the problem lies not in the puppet show itself, but in the intentions of the director of this puppet show. Due to the constant instigation and connivance of the United States, Lee Seung-man, this puppet, is becoming more and more嚣张. According to an Associated Press Seoul dispatch on April 10: Lee Seung-man recently wrote to US President Eisenhower, saying that "the United States must first guarantee a great strengthening of the South Korean armed forces, and then South Korea will agree to participate in the Geneva Conference." Byun Young-tae, the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Lee Seung-man puppet government, also admitted that the "guarantee" that US Secretary of State Dulles made to Lee Seung-man to agree to withdraw from the conference ninety days after the Geneva Conference was held has "encouraged" the Lee Seung-man clique. Recently, the United States decided to hold three large-scale military exercises in Korea from April 20 to June 25, which further emboldened the Lee Seung-man bandit gang that was clamoring to "resist" the Geneva Conference.

The intentions of the puppet show director are well known. It is to intensify the "cold war" in the Korean region while actively interfering in the "hot war" in Indochina, in order to sabotage the Geneva Conference and obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese issues. However, the clamor of the US puppets seems so weak and insignificant in the cheers and chorus of people all over the world striving for peace! It will never be these clamors that determine the international situation, but the voice of the people all over the world.

    汉城的傀儡戏
    禾生
    日内瓦会议前夕，李承晚傀儡戏班忙得不可开交。在美国牵线人的导演下，李承晚又在高叫“向北进军”、“统一朝鲜”……。据国际新闻社报道：李承晚在三月二十三日曾说“日内瓦会议决不能使朝鲜统一，他要求美国给予武器、空军和海军的支持，以便使韩国步兵能够在会议失败时向北挺进。”
    然而，这还不是最“精彩”的节目，据合众社汉城消息：不久前代表李承晚到东南亚各国去“访问”的崔德新说，关于讨论李承晚建议“在亚洲国家间组成反共联盟问题的会议将于四月二十六日（正是日内瓦会议开幕日——作者）在汉城举行”，被邀请的有台湾国民党残匪、菲律宾和印度支那三个傀儡政权的代表。
    当然，汉城将要上演的这出傀儡戏是不会有什么观众，更不会有什么喝彩的，人们只要听听像李承晚、蒋介石、麦格赛赛、保大这些角色的名字就够了。但问题倒不在傀儡戏的本身，而是这出傀儡戏导演者的用心。由于美国的百般指使和纵容，李承晚这个傀儡是愈来愈嚣张了。据美联社四月十日汉城电讯透露：李承晚最近曾写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔说，“美国必须首先保证大大加强韩国武装部队，然后南朝鲜才同意参加日内瓦会议。”李承晚伪政府的“外务部长官”卞荣泰也承认：美国国务卿杜勒斯向李承晚提出的同意在日内瓦会议举行九十天后退出会议的“保证”，已使李承晚集团受到了“鼓舞”。最近，美国决定从四月二十日到六月二十五日这一期间在朝鲜举行三次大规模的军事演习，更给高叫“抵制”日内瓦会议的李承晚匪帮壮了胆。
    傀儡戏导演者的用心是路人皆知的，就是要在积极干涉印度支那的“热战”的同时，加紧在朝鲜地区进行“冷战”，以便破坏日内瓦会议、阻挠朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的和平解决。然而，美国傀儡的叫嚣，在全世界人民争取和平的欢呼和合唱中显得是多么微弱和渺小啊！决定国际局势的将永远不是这些叫嚣，而是全世界人民的声音。
