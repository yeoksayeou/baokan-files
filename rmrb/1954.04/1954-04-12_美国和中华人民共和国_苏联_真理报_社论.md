    The United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China have become the main focus of American policy in Asia. In pursuing this policy, the United States attempted to invade China through the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. To establish a bridgehead for aggression against the People's Republic of China, the United States launched a war in Korea. American air forces have appeared over Chinese territory more than once, dropping deadly items on Chinese cities. In 1950, American armed forces occupied the island of Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since time immemorial. American intelligence agencies are sending spies and saboteurs into China.
    The American military is currently training troops in Taiwan, preparing to attack the People's Republic of China. Under the orders of the American government, an economic blockade has been imposed on the People's Republic of China. American imperialists are conducting "psychological warfare" against the People's Republic of China, threatening to use atomic weapons against the Chinese people. These are the undeniable facts of American aggression against the People's Republic of China, known to the whole world.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, repelled the American aggression against Korea, gave the interventionists a severe lesson, and drove their forces back to where they launched their aggression. The American aggressors hate China to the point of losing their minds, and after suffering defeat in Korea and losing their military reputation and political influence, they are planning new adventures on China's borders. They are openly interfering in the war that French armed forces have been waging against the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos for more than seven years. The United States is participating more and more actively in this war, and as American newspapers frankly admit, the American goal is to establish a bridgehead right next to the border of the People's Republic of China, from which they can launch aggression against Chinese territory.
    We must consider this point of view in order to understand why U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently provocatively clamored for "united action" in Indochina; American newspapers explained that "united action" means that the United States and its allies will intervene "as in the case of Korea."
    The aim of the American imperialists is to expand their aggression in Indochina, which borders the People's Republic of China; they want to provoke a war against China. It is no accident that the well-informed American newspaper "The Christian Science Monitor" plainly stated that some powerful people in the State Department and the Pentagon believe that the communist Chinese regime must be eliminated sooner or later.
    In order to justify to the public the adventurous policy of expanding the war in Indochina and carrying out aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China, Dulles gave a speech to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on April 5. He frightened the audience with the lie that the People's Republic of China was "very close" to participating in the war in Indochina, but this lie was fabricated by Dulles himself.
    The slanderous nature of Dulles's statement is very obvious. Everyone knows that it is not China but the United States that is actively participating in the aggression against Indochina. The United States is transporting airplanes, cannons, tanks, shells, and napalm bombs to Indochina.
    The United States is also sending pilots to participate in the fighting on the Indochina battlefield.
    The United States is doing everything possible to prevent France from negotiating with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of ending the war. It can also be seen from the above-mentioned speech by Dulles that the United States is prepared to greatly expand this war, in which it mainly intends to use the troops of the United States' allies and dependencies, first of all, the troops of France and of Asian countries such as the Philippines and South Korea as cannon fodder.
    No matter how hard this leader of American diplomacy tried in his lengthy speech, he could not escape from the fact that the American ruling clique is guilty of aggression against the People's Republic of China.
    These facts are known to the whole world.
    Everyone knows that the United States seized the Chinese island of Taiwan and has held it until now.
    The American armed forces controlled the Chinese island of Taiwan as early as 1950, and the American aggressors have turned the island into a stronghold for preparing to expand aggression against the People's Republic of China. It is worth noting here that the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Carney, said at the end of 1953 that Taiwan is "one of the important fortresses of the United States, politically and geographically." He also said that there is no "reason to reduce naval forces in this region (referring to Taiwan - editor's note). Naval forces should be increased rather than decreased."
    The American military is busy reorganizing and training the defeated remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who fled from the mainland in Taiwan. Representatives of the U.S. military command make no secret of the fact that they want to use the Chiang Kai-shek troops they have reorganized and rearmed for new adventures against the People's Republic of China.
    However, such obvious facts of aggression as the occupation of Taiwan Island, the establishment of American naval and air force bases on the island, and the practical use of the island as a military stronghold and a center for organizing and dispatching spies and saboteurs against the People's Republic of China are not the only ones.
    Everyone knows that the United States is not only using Kuomintang elements to deal with the People's Republic of China, but they are also rebuilding the Japanese army and strengthening Japan's military potential in order to invade the mainland.
    The one-sided "peace" treaty concluded in San Francisco in September 1951 by the United States and some countries that follow the U.S. foreign policy on one side, and Japan on the other, does not pursue the goal of peace at all. The purpose of this treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security" Treaty signed at the same time is to lay the foundation for another war in the Far East. They have turned Japan into an American military base, stipulated that Japan be dragged into aggressive military alliances, and created the premise for the revival of Japanese militarism.
    At present, there are already hundreds of American military bases operating on Japanese territory. At the same time, Japan is re-establishing its armed forces. The robber spirit of the old Japanese imperial army that invaded China in 1931 is being revived in this army. Just recently, in March 1954, the United States and Japan signed a new so-called military agreement on "aid" and "joint defense." According to this agreement, Japan receives various firearms, cannons, tanks, destroyers, submarines, minesweepers, all types of airplanes, and landing craft from the United States.
    All of this shows that the United States is preparing offensive forces in Japan to invade the mainland. Everyone knows that the U.S. government is waging an economic war against the People's Republic of China, it has implemented an "embargo" and organized a naval blockade of China in order to obstruct trade between China and other countries as much as possible.
    The United States is attempting in this way to undermine the large-scale peaceful construction of the People's Republic of China. Dozens of merchant ships of various countries have been subjected to piratical interception by Kuomintang elements riding American ships and using American weapons in Chinese territorial waters, including British ships, Italian ships, Danish ships, Greek ships, Finnish ships, and other countries' ships.
    The American ruling clique attempts to justify this piracy by invoking the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the imposition of an embargo. However, everyone knows that this resolution was forced through the Assembly by the American delegation.
    Indeed, the blockade organized by the United States has not produced the results expected by the organizers of the blockade. People's China has expanded its international economic ties, primarily with the countries of the democratic camp, and is victoriously developing its national economy and strengthening its national power. However, this also shows the extent to which American aggression against China, conducted under the banner of the United Nations, has gone.
    Finally, a rather important fact should also be mentioned. We are referring to the fact that many prominent American politicians, such as Republican Senators Bridges and Brick, Congressman Van Zandt, etc., constantly mention in their speeches plans for the American military to take direct military action against the People's Republic of China using any weapons of mass destruction (up to and including atomic bombs). The American government never refutes or condemns such remarks. This shows that these remarks are in line with the general direction of the aggressive policy towards China pursued by the American ruling clique.
    As soon as there is the slightest hint of further easing of international tensions, the drafters and advocates of America's notorious "Cold War" policy immediately erupt in a fit of hysteria. American monopoly capitalists, cornered by the impending economic crisis, see the prosperity of war as the only salvation. They see war as a chance to breathe, they expect military orders to revitalize factories that are about to shut down, thereby allowing them to continue squeezing maximum profits.
    American monopoly capitalists see any sign of consolidating peace as a blow to this plan. Precisely for this reason, on the eve of the upcoming Geneva Conference, American diplomatic authorities and propaganda organs have intensified their provocative attacks on the People's Republic of China. They are afraid at every thought that the Korean issue might be resolved peacefully in the end, they are afraid that the war in Indochina might be stopped, and they are afraid that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be recognized. These results all mean that peace in Asia will be consolidated, and American monopoly capitalists, who have tied all their plans to war, fear this result the most.
    The American movement hostile to the People's Republic of China has recently reached its peak. Leading American politicians, including Dulles, in some of their statements, have openly declared adventurous plans against the People's Republic of China. Dulles distorted the facts and attempted to slander the People's Republic of China, and Dulles blatantly clamored for aggression against China in his public speeches.
    But this policy will not bring good results to its advocates. Apparently, some people want to forget the obvious lessons that the American aggressors received in Korea. Only in this way can Dulles's current clamoring for a "Korean version" in Indochina be explained. However, everyone knows what the outcome of this attempt will be, it will only end in the defeat of the aggressors. The people of the world are watching the adventurous intrigues of American diplomacy on the eve of the Geneva Conference, and the people of the world will properly assess them. The people of the world can see that America's aggressive policy is the main obstacle to establishing peace in Asia.

### 美国和中华人民共和国——苏联“真理报”社论

    美国和中华人民共和国
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    美国对中华人民共和国进行侵略行动已经成为美国在亚洲的政策的主要方针。美国在奉行这种政策当中，曾经企图通过朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领土侵略中国。为了建立一个对中华人民共和国进行侵略的桥头堡，美国在朝鲜发动了战争。美国空军不止一次地在中国领土上空出现，并向中华人民共和国城镇投下了致命的东西。一九五○年，美国武装部队占领了从不可记忆的时候起就是中国的领土的台湾岛。美国间谍机关在派遣间谍和破坏分子潜入中国。
    美国军方现正在台湾训练军队，准备进攻中华人民共和国。在美国政府的命令下，对中华人民共和国实行经济封锁。美帝国主义者正对中华人民共和国进行“心理战”，他们威胁着要对中国人民使用原子武器。这就是全世界都知道的、不容置辩的美国侵略中华人民共和国的事实。
    中国人民志愿军会同朝鲜人民军击退了美国对朝鲜的侵略，给予了干涉者以严厉的教训，把干涉者的军队赶回到他们原来发动侵略的地方。美国侵略者憎恨中国到了丧失理智的程度，因而在朝鲜遭到失败、军事声名与政治影响丧失以后，又策划在中国的边境进行新的冒险。他们正公开干预法国武装部队对越南、高棉和寮国人民进行了七年多的战争。美国越来越积极地参加到这个战争里面去，如美国报纸直认不讳的，美国的目的是要在紧接中华人民共和国边境的地方建立一个桥头堡，从这里就能对中国领土进行侵略。
    必须考虑到这种观点，我们才能理解美国国务卿杜勒斯为什么最近挑衅性地叫嚣要在印度支那实行“联合行动”；美国报纸解释说，“联合行动”的意义就是说，美国及其盟国“以朝鲜为事例”进行干涉。
    美帝国主义者的目的是要在和中华人民共和国接壤的印度支那扩大侵略行动，他们想要挑拨起对中国的战争。消息灵通的美国报纸“基督教科学箴言报”明白地说，国务院和五角大楼里有些有势力的人们认为共产党中国政权迟早一定要加以消灭，这绝不是偶然的。
    为了向公众辩解在印度支那扩大战争以及向中华人民共和国进行侵略行动的冒险政策，杜勒斯于四月五日在众议院外交委员会发表演说，他用中华人民共和国“非常接近”于参加印度支那战争的谎言来吓唬听众，然而这个谎言只是杜勒斯自己制造出来的。
    杜勒斯这种说法的诽谤性质是非常明显的。大家都知道，积极参加对印度支那的侵略的不是中国而是美国。美国正在把飞机、大炮、坦克、炮弹与凝固汽油弹运到印度支那去。
    美国还派遣飞机驾驶员去参加印度支那战场的战斗。
    美国以一切可能的办法来阻止法国与越南民主共和国政府就结束战争问题进行谈判。从上述杜勒斯演说中也可以看出，美国准备大大地扩大这个战争，在战争中主要要利用美国的盟国和附属国的军队，首先是利用法国的军队以及如菲律宾和南朝鲜这些亚洲国家的军队充当炮灰。
    这位美国外交界的领袖在他的长篇累牍的演说中无论怎样费尽气力，他也无法从证明美国统治集团犯有对中华人民共和国进行侵略的罪行的事实中逃脱。
    这些事实已为全世界所共见。
    大家知道，美国强占了中国的台湾岛，直到现在还把它抓在手中。
    美国的武装部队早在一九五○年就控制了中国的台湾岛，美国侵略者把该岛变成准备扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略的据点。这里值得注意的是，美国海军作战部长卡涅曾在一九五三年底说过：台湾是美国“政治上和地理上的重要的堡垒之一”。他并且还说，没有“理由减少在这一地区（指台湾——编者注）的海军部队。海军部队与其说应该减少，不如说应该增加”。
    美国的军人忙着在台湾整编和训练已被击溃的、从大陆上逃出去的蒋介石残余匪帮。美军司令部的代表毫不掩饰，他们要将他们所重新整编和重新武装起来的蒋介石军队用来对中华人民共和国进行新的冒险。
    但是，像强占台湾岛、在该岛建立美国的海军和空军基地、实际上利用该岛作为军事据点和组织及派遣用来对付中华人民共和国的间谍和破坏分子的中心这样明显的侵略的事实并不是唯一的。
    大家知道，美国不仅是在利用国民党分子来对付中华人民共和国，他们还在重建日本军队和加强日本的军事潜力，以便侵略大陆。
    以美国和追随美国外交政策的一些国家为一方、日本为另一方于一九五一年九月在旧金山缔结的片面“和”约追求的绝不是和平的目标。这个条约以及同时签订的美日“安全”条约的目的是奠定在远东的另一次战争的基础。它们把日本变成了美国的军事基地，规定了把日本拖入侵略性的军事联盟，并创造了复活日本军国主义的前提。
    目前，在日本领土上，已经有几百个美国军事基地在起着作用了。同时，日本正在重新建立武装部队。一九三一年侵略中国的旧日本皇军的强盗精神正在这支军队中复活起来。就在不久以前，在一九五四年三月，美国和日本签订了新的所谓“援助”和“共同防御”的军事协定。根据这个协定，日本自美国得到各种枪械、大炮、坦克、驱逐舰、潜水艇、扫雷艇、各种类型的飞机和登陆艇。
    这一切都说明，美国正在日本准备着用来侵略大陆的进攻部队。大家都知道，美国政府在对中华人民共和国进行经济战争，它实行了“禁运”，对中国组织了海军封锁，以便尽量阻碍中国和其他国家的贸易。
    美国企图这样来破坏中华人民共和国大规模的和平建设。有数十艘各国的商船在中国领海上遭到乘着美国船只、使用美国武器的国民党分子海盗般的拦截，这里面有英国船、意大利船、丹麦船、希腊船、芬兰船以及其他国家的船只。
    美国统治集团借口联合国大会关于实行禁运的决议，企图来为这种海盗行为辩解。然而，谁都知道，这个决议是美国代表团强使大会通过的。
    确实，美国所组织的封锁没有产生这种封锁的组织者所预期的结果。人民中国扩展了国际经济联系，首先是和民主阵营各国的联系，胜利地发展着自己的国民经济，加强着自己的国力。然而，从这件事也可以看出，美国打起联合国旗帜所进行的对中国的侵略到了怎样一种地步了。
    最后，还应当提起一个相当重要的事实。我们指的是：许多显要的美国政治人物，像共和党参议员布里奇斯、布里克，众议员范展特等不断地在他们的言论中谈到美国军队使用任何大规模毁灭性武器（直到原子弹）直接对中华人民共和国采取军事行动的计划。美国政府对这种言论从不加以驳斥或谴责。这就说明，这种言论是符合美国统治集团所奉行的对中国的侵略政策的总方针的。
    只要有国际紧张局势可能进一步缓和的一点暗示，美国臭名远扬的“冷战”政策的拟订者和鼓吹者就会马上爆发一阵歇斯底里的叫喊。美国垄断资本家被正在迫近的经济危机逼到墙角，他们把战争的繁荣看成是唯一的救星。他们把战争看成是喘气的机会，他们指望有军事订货来振兴即将停工的工厂，从而使他们得以继续榨取最大限度的利润。
    美国垄断资本家把任何巩固和平的迹象看成是对这种计划的打击。正因为如此，在现在即将举行日内瓦会议的前夕，美国外交当局和宣传机关加紧对中华人民共和国进行挑衅性攻击。每一想到朝鲜问题可能最后和平解决他们便要害怕，他们害怕可能在印度支那停止战争，他们害怕必须承认中华人民共和国在联合国里的合法权利。这些结果都意味着亚洲和平将得到巩固，而把他们的一切计划都与战争联系起来的美国垄断资本家则最害怕这种结果。
    美国敌视中华人民共和国的运动最近到达了顶点。美国居领导地位的政治家包括杜勒斯在内，在他们的一些声明中，就公开地宣布反对中华人民共和国的冒险计划。杜勒斯歪曲事实，企图诬蔑中华人民共和国，杜勒斯在他的公开演说中公然叫嚣侵略中国。
    但是这种政策是不会给它的鼓吹者带来好结果的。显然，某些人要想忘记美国侵略者在朝鲜所受到的明显的教训。只有这样才能解释杜勒斯现在又在叫嚣在印度支那来一个“朝鲜的翻版”。但是，大家知道这种企图将会得到怎样的结果，那只会以侵略者的失败告终。世界人民都在注视着日内瓦会议前夕美国外交的冒险性的阴谋活动，世界人民是会恰当地估价它们的。世界人民看得出，美国的侵略政策是建立亚洲和平的主要障碍。
