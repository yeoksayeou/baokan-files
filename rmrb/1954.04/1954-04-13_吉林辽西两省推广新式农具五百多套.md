Jilin and Liaoxi provinces continued to promote more than 500 sets of new agricultural implements this year. In order to ensure quality and timely distribution, the Agricultural Department of the Jilin Provincial People's Government sent cadres to the Lingshan Agricultural Implement Factory in Anshan City and the Shenyang Agricultural Implement Factory to inspect the quality of the agricultural implements. After the agricultural implements passed the inspection, they were directly transported from the factory to the counties. The province also added eighteen agricultural technology extension stations and established agricultural technology extension general stations in eleven counties to guide the organized farmers in using the new agricultural implements well. In order to take care of the farmers' ability to bear the burden and expand the scope of promotion of new agricultural implements, Liaoxi Province has determined the principle of "renting and lending combined" this year. That is, general small agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, compactors, and seeders are directly lent to farmers for use, and larger agricultural implements such as harvesters and threshers are lent to agricultural technology extension stations for rent to farmers. Now each station has found tenants and is carrying out farmer driver training. According to statistics from ten counties including Heishan, Beizhen, and Zhangwu, more than 500 people have been trained, and they have generally learned the technology of using, assembling, disassembling, and adjusting, as well as simple maintenance work.

Before this year, Jilin and Liaoxi provinces had promoted more than 1,100 sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements. In places where new agricultural implements are used, not only has the yield per unit area been significantly increased, but also the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid and cooperation organizations have been promoted. The new agricultural implements are warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers.

    吉林辽西两省推广新式农具五百多套
    吉林、辽西两省今年继续推广了五百多套新式农具。为了保证质量和发放及时，吉林省人民政府农业厅曾派出干部到鞍山市灵山农具工厂和沈阳农具工厂，检查农具质量。农具经查合格后，由工厂直接运到各县。该省还增建了十八处农业技术推广站，并在十一个县建立了农业技术推广总站，以便指导组织起来的农民使好新农具。辽西省为了照顾农民负担能力、扩大新农具的推广范围，今年确定了“租贷结合”的原则。就是把一般小农具如犁、耙、镇压器、播种机等，直接贷放给农民使用，较大型农具如收割机、脱谷机等，贷给农业技术推广站，由站租给农民使用。现在各站已找好租借对象，正在进行农民驾驶员训练工作。据黑山、北镇、彰武等十个县统计，已训练出五百多人，一般都学会了使用、装卸、调整技术以及简单的检修工作。
    吉林、辽西两省在今年以前已推广了一千一百多套马拉农具。使用新农具的地方，不但显著地提高了单位面积产量，并促进了互助合作组织的巩固和提高。新农具受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。
