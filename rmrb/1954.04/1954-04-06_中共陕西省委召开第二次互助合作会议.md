    The CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee Convenes Second Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference
    [This newspaper dispatch] Since last winter, Shaanxi Province has newly established 405 agricultural producers' cooperatives and expanded 59 of the original 234 old cooperatives. At present, the work of establishing cooperatives is still continuing, and it is expected that there will be 718 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province by the end of April. Currently, 639 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province have entered the stage of intensive spring production. At the same time, various types of mutual aid teams have also developed considerably. In Tongchuan County alone, since last winter, in addition to consolidating the existing mutual aid teams, more than 370 individual peasant households have joined mutual aid teams. In order to preliminarily summarize the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives since last winter and to study the specific arrangements for promoting the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement this year, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee convened the Second Shaanxi Provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference from March 15 to 25.
    The conference believed that the work of establishing cooperatives during this period was relatively meticulous and steady, basically implementing the spirit of the central government's "actively lead, steadily advance" principle, and through the pilot establishment of cooperatives, cultivated a large number of cadres who understand the principles, policies, methods, and steps of establishing cooperatives. In the Hanzhong area alone, more than 50 cadres with independent work capabilities for establishing cooperatives have been trained. However, in individual regions, there are still many shortcomings in the work. In some areas, the ideological mobilization work was rough, only generally publicizing the General Line, without educating the peasants in light of the experience of organizing mutual aid teams in the past and handling the problems existing in the mutual aid teams; some areas inappropriately screened out many peasants who signed up to join the cooperatives with overly strict conditions; some areas, in dealing with specific problems, only proceeded from the emotions of a few active elements, failing to take care of the members who still had some ideological concerns, showing some impetuous and rash emotions. Therefore, the conference emphasized that the completion of the cooperatives is only the beginning of the entire pilot work, and the more important and complex issue is to reverse certain unhealthy phenomena in the development. It is wrong to think that once the cooperative is established, it can be "withdrawn" or "breathed a sigh of relief."
    The conference required all regions to strengthen the consolidation work of new and expanded cooperatives. For newly established cooperatives, an in-depth inspection and review should be conducted in accordance with the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, combined with production activities, to help solve the problems existing within the cooperative, so that it can quickly shift to production, and strengthen the management of all agricultural cooperatives, establish necessary and feasible systems for production management, labor organization, and financial management, conduct the "four appraisals" of labor, land, livestock, and farm tools; and formulate annual and seasonal production plans with planting plans as the main focus, improve farming techniques, and ensure that the output of the cooperative and the actual income of its members exceed the level of ordinary mutual aid teams and individual households before joining the cooperative, so as to fully demonstrate the superiority of agricultural cooperatives. The conference pointed out that because the cooperatives are newly established, everything should be simplified, and the existing funds and national loans should be used in aspects that are decisive for increasing production. Other things that can be postponed can be temporarily left undone. Regarding the valuation of draught animals, the burden of livestock prices, the evaluation of land productivity, the joining of farm tools, and the distribution ratio of land and labor in the establishment of cooperatives, which have significantly harmed the interests of middle peasants or poor peasants, or have excessively accumulated public property and increased the burden on members, the principle of unity and mutual benefit and the spirit of gradual transition and gradual transformation should be followed. First, the party that has benefited and the leaders of the cooperative should be educated, then the general members should be educated, and then, in conjunction with spring plowing, they should be re-processed to remove some concerns of the members. To this end, all regions should continue to cultivate the leading backbone and activists of the cooperative, continuously improve their political awareness, gradually develop the organizations of the Party and the League, and strengthen the strength of the Party. The county Party committees, district Party committees, and branches should strengthen the inspection and leadership of Party members and League members, educate them to play a leading role in the cooperative with their exemplary actions, unite and educate the general members, and better realize the leadership of the Party, consolidate and improve the agricultural producers' cooperatives. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of the members, further study the General Line, conduct education on the consistency of collective interests and individual interests, and draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism.
    The conference pointed out that in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, more efforts should be made to lead the existing types of mutual aid teams. The conference also analyzed and criticized the "emphasizing cooperation and neglecting mutual aid" mentality that is growing among cadres, pointing out that it is inappropriate for some places to propose that the county Party committee should focus on leading agricultural producers' cooperatives, the district should focus on leading year-round mutual aid teams, and the township should focus on leading temporary mutual aid teams. Any practice of neglecting mutual aid teams, discriminating against individual peasants, or failing to actively educate and lead them is wrong.
    In order to consolidate and improve the work of existing cooperatives, the conference especially emphasized that the local Party committees and county Party committees must strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and all work must not deviate from the central work of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation. Party committees at all levels must personally take action, take out a certain amount of time, go deep into the countryside, discover problems, specifically help and guide the cadres below to solve problems, learn from experience, summarize experience, and guide the general. They should also strengthen learning, improve the level of leadership, and conduct education on the principles and policies of mutual aid and cooperation for all cadres through various meetings. Party committees at all levels must designate a deputy secretary or standing committee member to be specifically and conscientiously responsible, and the relevant departments should dispatch a certain number of capable cadres to regularly study the materials of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and help the Party organizations in the districts and townships solve relevant problems. It is required to do a good job in every agricultural producers' cooperative and drive the development of mutual aid teams.

### 中共陕西省委召开第二次互助合作会议

    中共陕西省委召开第二次互助合作会议
    【本报讯】陕西省自去冬以来，已新建立农业生产合作社四百零五个，并使原有的二百三十四个旧社中有五十九社得到扩大。目前，建社工作仍在继续进行，预计到四月底，全省将有七百一十八个农业生产合作社。现在全省已有六百三十九个农业生产合作社进入紧张的春季生产。同时，各种类型的互助组也有相当发展。仅铜川一县，自去冬以来，除整顿好原有的互助组外，并有三百七十多户单干农民参加了互助组。为初步总结了去冬以来建立农业生产合作社的工作，研究今年推进整个互助合作运动的具体安排。中共陕西省委于三月十五日到二十五日召开了陕西省第二次互助合作会议。
    会议认为这一时期的建社工作是比较细致稳当的，基本上贯彻了中央“积极领导，稳步前进”的精神，并通过试办建社，培养了一大批懂得建社方针、政策与方法、步骤的干部。仅汉中专区，即已培养出五十多名具有独立工作能力的建社干部。但是在个别地区，工作中还有不少缺点。有些地区，思想发动工作粗糙，只一般地宣传了总路线，没有结合过去组织互助组的经验、处理互助组中存在的问题，向农民进行教育；有些地区不适当地把许多报名入社的农民以过严的条件审查出社；有些地区在处理具体问题中，只从少数积极分子的情绪出发，未照顾到还有若干思想顾虑的社员，表现了某些急躁冒进的情绪。因此会议着重指出：社的建成，仅是全部试办工作的开端，更重要更复杂的问题是应将发展中的某些不健康现象扭转过来。如果认为把社建立起来了，就可以“收兵回营”，或可以“松一口气”是错误的。
    会议要求各地加强对新社和扩建社的巩固工作。对新建社，应根据自愿互利原则，结合生产活动，进行一次深入的检查和审查，帮助解决社内存在的问题，使其迅速转入生产，并加强所有农业社的经营管理，建立生产管理、劳动组织和财务管理等必要可行的制度，进行劳力、土地、牲畜、农具的“四评”工作；并制订出以种植计划为主的全年的和季节的生产计划，提高耕作技术，务使社的产量和社员的实际收入，超过一般互助组与各户入社以前的水平，以充分显示农业社的优越性。会议指出：由于社初成立，一切应因陋就简，对现有资金和国家的贷款，要用在对增产有决定意义的方面，其他凡可缓办的事情，暂时都可以不办。对建社中耕畜折价，畜价负担，土地评产，农具入社，土地和劳动分配比例等方面，显著伤害了中农或贫农利益，或过多积累公共财产使社员负担过重的，应本团结互利原则与逐步过渡、逐步改造的精神，首先教育占便宜的一方和社的领导人，再教育一般社员，并结合春耕生产重新加以处理，以解除社员思想上的某些顾虑。为此，各地要继续培养社的领导骨干和积极分子，不断提高他们的政治觉悟，逐步发展党和团的组织，壮大党的力量。县委、区委和支部要加强对党员团员的检查和领导，教育他们在社内以自己的模范行动，起带头骨干作用，团结和教育一般社员，更好地实现党的领导，巩固提高农业生产合作社。同时，要继续加强社员的政治思想教育，进一步学习总路线，进行集体利益与个人利益一致性的教育，划清社会主义与资本主义界限。
    会议指出：在领导互助合作运动中，还要用更大的努力领导好现有的各类互助组。并分析批判了在干部中滋长着的“重合作轻互助”的思想，指出有些地方提出县委重点领导农业生产合作社，区重点领导常年互助组，乡重点领导临时互助组的办法是不妥的。任何轻视互助组和歧视单干农民和不积极教育领导的作法都是错误的。
    为了巩固和提高现有社的工作，会议特别强调指出：各地委、县委必须加强对互助合作运动的领导，一切工作不能离开农业生产和互助合作的中心工作。各级党委，必须亲自动手，抽出一定的时间，深入农村，发现问题、具体帮助和指导下边干部解决问题，吸取经验，总结经验，指导一般。并加强学习，提高领导水平，通过各种会议对全体干部进行互助合作政策的方针教育。各级党委必须指定副书记或常委委员专人认真负责，并由各有关部门抽派一定数量的得力干部，经常研究互助合作运动的材料，帮助区、乡的党组织解决有关问题。要求办好每一个农业生产合作社，带动互助组的发展。
