Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: U.S. Vice President Nixon stated in a speech that if the situation requires, "if the French forces withdraw," "the United States may have to send troops to Indochina." This statement has aroused great indignation among the broad strata of the French public, who believe that such a plan risks expanding the war in Indochina.

    The French Socialist Party newspaper "Le Populaire" of Paris said: "We demand peace through negotiation rather than expanding the war. ... We demand negotiations with Ho Chi Minh with serious guarantees to end the war."

    "Combat" believes that Nixon's speech is "very regrettable." The newspaper pointed out that this idea of his "has been a major factor in the American plan for Indochina for several months." The newspaper said that France's position at the Geneva Conference "will be very difficult," and now "at the very least it has been trifled with," because Nixon's speech sounds as if it "definitively declared the fundamental principles of negotiation dead." The newspaper concluded: "London and Paris are not enthusiastic about the theory of 'united action.' If the theory of 'separate action' is now put forward, the allies will never be able to unite at the Geneva Conference."

    "Le Figaro's" Washington correspondent, Chatelaine, pointed out that Nixon's speech "coincides with the constant rumors that the U.S. military command, which has already dispatched two aircraft carriers to the Gulf of Tonkin, is currently conducting air and naval preparations in the Pacific."

    "L'Humanité" pointed out that the purpose of Nixon's speech is to "gradually prepare public opinion" so that public opinion will recognize that American intervention in Indochina is "inevitable." "L'Humanité" said: "Diplomatically, the main goal of the United States on the eve of the Geneva Conference is to tie France's hands, so that Bidault has no choice but to echo Dulles." "L'Humanité" said: Nixon's speech is "a formal recognition that the war in Indochina will henceforth be America's war."

    法国广大公众谴责尼克松的好战叫嚣
    【新华社二十日讯】美国副总统尼克松发表演说说，假若形势需要，“如果法军退出”，“美国可能不得不派遣军队到印度支那去”。这种声明已经引起法国广大阶层的公众的极大的愤慨，他们认为这样的计划有使印度支那战争扩大的危险。
    法国社会党报纸巴黎“人民报”说：“我们要求通过谈判来实现和平而不是扩大战争。……我们要求在有认真的保证的条件下和胡志明进行谈判以结束战争。”
    “战斗报”认为尼克松的演说“非常令人遗憾”，这个报纸指出，他的这个想法“好几个月以来一直是美国对印度支那的计划的主要因素”。这个报纸说，法国在日内瓦会议上的处境“将非常困难”，现在“至少说它已被人作弄”，因为尼克松的演说听起来好像是“把谈判的根本原则都肯定地宣布了死刑”。该报最后说：“伦敦和巴黎对于‘联合行动’的理论并不热心。假若现在又提出‘单独行动’的理论，那么盟国在日内瓦会议上绝不可能团结。”
    “费加罗报”驻华盛顿记者夏特兰指出，尼克松的演说“正吻合不断传出的这样的谣传：已经派遣了两艘航空母舰到东京湾去的美军司令部，目前正在太平洋上进行空军与海军方面的准备工作。”
   “人道报”指出：尼克松演说的目的，是要“逐渐准备舆论”，使舆论承认美国干涉印度支那是“不可避免的”。“人道报”说：“在外交上，美国在日内瓦会议前夕的主要目的，是要捆绑法国的手脚，使得皮杜尔除了附和杜勒斯以外没有其他办法。”“人道报”说：尼克松的演说是“正式承认今后印度支那的战争就是美国的战争”。
