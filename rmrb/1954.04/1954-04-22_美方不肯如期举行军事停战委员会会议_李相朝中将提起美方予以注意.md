Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 20th, the Korean-Chinese side brought to the attention of the US side the issue of the US side disregarding the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and refusing to hold the Military Armistice Commission meeting as scheduled on four occasions.

Since March 8th, the US side has, on four occasions after receiving notifications from the Korean-Chinese side regarding the convening of the Military Armistice Commission meeting, refused to hold the meeting as scheduled, postponing the meeting by twelve to forty-eight hours. This not only does not comply with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, but also affects the normal work of the Military Armistice Commission and the timely handling of issues. Article 31 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates: During the recess of the Military Armistice Commission, "the senior member of either side may terminate such recess by giving twenty-four hours' notice."

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out at the meeting on the 20th: "Our side believes that if one side has uncontrollable reasons, it can request a postponement. However, because your side has recently continuously requested postponements of the meeting date, this cannot but affect the normal work of the Military Armistice Commission. I hereby bring this to your attention."

    美方不肯如期举行军事停战委员会会议
    李相朝中将提起美方予以注意
    【新华社开城二十日电】在二十日军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面就美方不顾停战协定的规定，四次不肯如期举行军事停战委员会会议的问题，提起美方的注意。
    自三月八日以来，美方曾四次在接到朝中方面关于召开军事停战委员会会议的通知后，不肯如期举行会议，把会议推迟十二小时至四十八小时。这不仅不符合停战协定的规定，而且影响军事停战委员会正常进行工作和及时处理问题。停战协定第三十一款规定：在军事停战委员会休会期间，“任何一方首席委员得以二十四小时以前的通知终止此项休会”。
    李相朝中将二十日在会上指出：“我方认为，如果有一方确有不能控制的原因是可以要求推迟的，但由于你方最近不断要求推迟会议日期，这就不能不影响到军事停战委员会正常地进行工作，对此我提起你方予以注意。”
