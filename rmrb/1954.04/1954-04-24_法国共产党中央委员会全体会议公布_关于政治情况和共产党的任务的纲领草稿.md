Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 22nd: According to TASS, on the eve of its Party Congress, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party adopted and published a draft program on the political situation and the tasks of the Communist Party in the struggle for national independence and peace, which is a program for the struggle to restore French national independence and peace. The draft program explains the current international situation and analyzes the disastrous policies that subordinate France to the interests of American imperialists.

The draft program states: If American capitalists have not been able to obtain from France the results they expected, this is due to the resistance of our people. This struggle of the French people is in line with the enormous changes taking place throughout the world—the continuous decline of the decadent capitalist world and the continuous consolidation of the socialist camp. This powerful socialist camp has curbed the aggressive forces of imperialism. In the economic competition between the two systems, the capitalist system has clearly failed.

The draft program points out the scale of the French people's struggle for peace, for the prohibition of atomic weapons, against the arming of Germany, and against the continuation of the Indochina War.

The draft program emphasizes that the Communist Party has always been a persistent fighter for the interests of France. The draft program stipulates the program of the French Communist Party's struggle for French national independence, peace, bread, and freedom. The Communist Party considers its main task to be opposing the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and opposing West German re-militarization. The Party believes that the notorious "European Defense Community" must be smashed and that a struggle must be waged for the establishment of a European collective security system.

The draft program continues: Because France's security is threatened, it is now more necessary than ever to fully implement the Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944. The Party will redouble its efforts to mobilize our people to support the Soviet Union's peaceful policies, and to support the Soviet Union's policy of replacing "power politics" with negotiation in all matters. The French Communist Party will continue to fight for the recognition of the People's Republic of China.

Everyone must be asked to struggle more actively to immediately stop the Indochina War.

The draft program emphasizes that the issue of strengthening the unity of action of the working class is the main issue at this stage. The establishment of a united proletarian front is a prerequisite for uniting all national democratic forces, and this unity is a decisive issue at this stage.

The draft program points out the need for fraternal cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party and Catholic workers.

The final part of the draft program discusses strengthening the Communist Party's position among the working people and strengthening the Party's ties with intellectuals.

    法国共产党中央委员会全体会议公布
    关于政治情况和共产党的任务的纲领草稿
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议在召开党代表大会前夕通过并公布的关于政治情况和共产党为争取民族独立及和平而斗争的任务的纲领草稿，是争取恢复法国民族独立和争取和平的斗争纲领。这个纲领草稿说明了目前的国际形势，并分析了使法国从属于美帝国主义者的利益的祸国殃民政策。
    纲领草稿说：如果美国资本家没有能够从法国得到他们所预期的结果，这是由于我国人民大众的反抗。法国人民的这个斗争和全世界所发生的巨大变化——腐朽的资本主义世界的不断衰退和社会主义阵营的不断巩固——是相符合的。这个强大的社会主义阵营遏止了帝国主义的侵略势力。在两种制度的经济竞赛中，资本主义制度显然失败了。
    纲领草稿指出了法国人民争取和平、争取禁止原子武器以及反对武装德国、反对继续印度支那战争的斗争规模。
    纲领草稿着重指出：共产党一直是坚持不懈地为法国的利益而斗争的战士。纲领草稿规定了法国共产党为法国民族独立、和平、面包和自由而斗争的纲领。共产党认为反对批准波恩条约和巴黎条约以及反对西德重新军国主义化是它的主要任务。党认为必须粉碎臭名远扬的“欧洲防务集团”，必须为建立欧洲集体安全体系而斗争。
    纲领草稿接着说：由于法国的安全受到威胁，现在比过去任何时候都更需要完全履行一九四四年的法苏条约。党将加倍努力动员我国人民支持苏联的和平政策，支持苏联处处以协商政策代替“实力政策”。法国共产党将继续为争取承认中华人民共和国而斗争。
    必须要求大家为争取立刻停止印度支那战争而更加积极地斗争。
    纲领草稿强调指出：加强工人阶级行动一致的问题，是现阶段的主要问题。成立一个团结一致的无产阶级阵线，是团结所有民族民主力量的先决条件，而这种团结在现阶段是一个决定性的问题。
    纲领草稿指出了共产党必须和社会党及天主教工人之间兄弟般合作。
    纲领草稿最后一部分谈到加强共产党在劳动人民中的地位以及加强党和知识分子的联系的问题。
