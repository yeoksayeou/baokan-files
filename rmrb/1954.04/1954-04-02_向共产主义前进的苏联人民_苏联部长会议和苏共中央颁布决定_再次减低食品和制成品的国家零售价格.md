TASS, Moscow, March 31st: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have issued a decision announcing a further reduction in state retail prices for food and manufactured goods, effective April 1, 1954. This is the seventh price reduction since 1947.

According to the decision, prices will be reduced for fifteen major categories of goods. These include: retail prices for bread, flour, and macaroni products reduced by 5 to 15 percent; grains and feed reduced by 5 to 8 percent; groceries reduced by 10 to 20 percent; textiles reduced by 10 to 20 percent; clothing, knitwear, and headwear reduced by 7 to 25 percent; footwear reduced by 7 to 20 percent; small articles of apparel reduced by 10 to 20 percent; soap, perfumes, and cosmetics reduced by 10 to 20 percent; cultural goods and toys reduced by 10 to 15 percent; porcelain, earthenware, and glassware reduced by 10 to 15 percent; household goods reduced by 10 to 20 percent; building materials reduced by 10 to 30 percent; matches and petroleum products reduced by 20 to 44.5 percent; sporting goods and other manufactured goods reduced by 5 to 15 percent; and medicines and hygiene products reduced by 10 to 15 percent.

In this price reduction, food prices in canteens and other food stores are also reduced accordingly.

In addition, when purchasing raw cotton, silkworm cocoons, hemp products, flax, and hemp at preferential prices, the prices of grain and oil cake sold to collective farmers who deliver these crops should be 10 percent lower than retail prices.

	Launching a Labor Competition to Welcome "May Day"
	Workers at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and many factories in the Soviet Union have launched a socialist labor competition to welcome International Labor Day on May 1st. The competition at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station was initiated by the workers at the Komsomol construction site who are building the navigation system. They decided to complete the construction and assembly plan for the first four months of this year by April 25th, pour 33,000 cubic meters of concrete on the locks, complete 110 percent of the earthwork plan, and reduce the cost of concrete engineering by 2 to 5 percent. After the call for competition was made, workers at the hydroelectric station construction site responded enthusiastically. Factories and mines in various regions also launched May Day competitions. In Ukraine, the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant, after successfully completing the holiday competition for election day, immediately proposed a May Day competition at a summary meeting. The workers decided to produce several thousand tons of steel more than planned for the state in March and April. Miners in Siberian mines completed the first quarter plan nine days ahead of schedule. They decided to extract at least three more trainloads of coal than planned in April and reduce the cost per ton of fuel.

	Spring Arrives at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Construction Site
	These days, the Volga River basin is experiencing early spring weather, and the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction site is showing a scene of active atmosphere. Hundreds of machines and mechanical equipment are working in the power plant foundation pit protected by the water retaining dam. Recently, the second part of the automatic concrete factory on the right bank of the Volga River started construction. Dredgers have already piled up thousands of cubic meters of mud on the left wing of the dam. The concrete pouring work on the reinforced concrete spillway dam is progressing victoriously. In 1955, the reinforced concrete spillway dam will raise the water level of the Volga River by 26 meters, and then a "Kuibyshev Sea" with a length of 500 kilometers and a width of 40 kilometers will appear on the map. Work on the construction site is becoming increasingly tense. The lower lock will be open to navigation next year, and concrete pouring is currently underway. The work on the bottom of the lock chamber of the upper lock is also in progress in order to pour concrete.

	Intense Flood Prevention on the Volga River
	The builders of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station are intensely preparing to prevent spring floods. The spring flood of the Volga River will soon rush to the power plant foundation pit very close to the heart of the river. Currently, the foundation pit extends 75 hectares, and the water retaining dam of the foundation pit will have to withstand the huge pressure of the spring flood and ice floes. Now the soil excavated by excavators from the foundation pit is all used to strengthen the water retaining dam and the dam. More than one million cubic meters of soil will be piled on the dam. As the preparation work for spring flood defense is about to end, hundreds of trucks are carrying sand and gravel from the right bank of the Volga River to the foundation pit, and nearly 4,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured into the foundation pit.

	Large Number of Enterprises Complete Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule
	Several thousand industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union have already successfully completed the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule. According to recent news from Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Vitebsk, Orel, and other cities, the machine manufacturing plants in these cities have overfulfilled the production plan for agricultural machinery and spare parts for the first quarter of this year. Among them, the Kharkov tractor assembly plant completed the production task for the first quarter ten days ahead of schedule, and has now produced dozens of tractors according to the April plan. Many coal mines in the Donbass, the Urals, and the Moscow coal region have also completed the production plan for the first three months of this year ahead of schedule. Light industrial enterprises in various regions have also exceeded the production plan for the first quarter and produced many more products for the country. The Moscow Kalinin Wool Textile Factory, the May 1st Wool Textile Factory, the "Bauman" Hosiery Factory, and other enterprises have completed the production tasks for the first quarter. The Kalinin Wool Textile Factory has exceeded the quarterly production plan for many days, and by the end of March, the factory will overproduce high-quality wool yarn worth 22.2 million rubles. In the Transcarpathian, Novgorod, and Kirov regions, many factories producing daily necessities and timber industry enterprises have also completed the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule.

	Building New Hospitals and Clinics
	This year, the Soviet medical cause will be further developed. In the first two months of this year, the Soviet government allocated 2.5 billion rubles for the construction of new hospitals, clinics, and sanatoriums. In the Russian Federation, Moscow will build twelve large hospitals this year, Lison will build three hospitals and several clinics, and Stalingrad, Kirov, Orel, and other cities are also building large hospitals. The Rovno region of Ukraine will build seventeen new hospitals before the end of this year, and Kharkov is building six new hospitals.

	"Air Ambulance" in the Far North
	The development of medical services in remote areas of the Soviet Union is very rapid. For example, before the October Revolution, the vast Far North region had only seven hospitals and twenty-five nurse stations, with a total of only eleven doctors and twenty-five nurses. But in the Soviet era, nearly two hundred hospitals, one thousand nurse stations and midwifery stations, twelve special clinics with wards, dozens of maternity hospitals, and many clinics, health stations, epidemic prevention stations, and air ambulance stations were opened there. The air ambulance station plays a very important role in providing medical services to residents in remote areas. In the past year alone, the medical staff of the air ambulance station in the Soviet Far North region performed more than six hundred operations on patients, cared for more than 27,000 patients, and transported more than 2,000 patients by plane to hospitals in district or regional centers for medical treatment. In addition, the medical staff in the Far North not only serve residents with fixed residences in fixed medical institutions, but also form many mobile medical teams to serve livestock breeders in nomadic areas.

	Expansion of Film Studios in Moscow and Other Places
	Film studios are being built and expanded in Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, Tashkent, Baku, and Riga. After the expansion, the output of the Moscow Film Studio can be increased threefold, with up to 40 color feature films produced annually; the output of the Leningrad Film Studio will also be doubled.

	The Soviet Union plans to produce a large number of films this year, including 148 newsreel documentaries, of which 72 reflect agricultural development and collective farm life, 7 reflect the development of trade and introduce advanced working methods of trade institutions, and 12 color travel scenery films depicting the scenery of Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and other places. In addition, there are documentaries about communist construction projects, industrial development, and people's culture, art, and sports activities.

	New Color Stereoscopic Films Receive Good Reviews
	Stereoscopic films and television films in the Soviet Union are gradually developing. Stereoscopic cinemas have been established in Moscow and Kiev, and stereoscopic cinemas will be established in Leningrad, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Tbilisi, Baku, Tashkent, Sochi, Odessa, and Rovno this year. The stereoscopic film production technology and expression methods in the Soviet Union are gradually improving, and the stereoscopic effect is strengthened accordingly. For example, the new color stereoscopic film "Aleko" (adapted from the opera of the same name by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff), which was recently staged in Leningrad, has received good reviews, and the film has new creations in using stereoscopic effects to express the original work's thoughts and artistic intentions. The television film industry is advancing with the development of the television industry. In Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, where television broadcasting stations have been established, television films are being shown using television broadcasting stations.

	Soviet Athletes Win Top Three Places in Chess Tournament
	The chess tournament was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, from February 24th to March 26th. The competition was sponsored by the Sports Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic. Eighteen chess players from nine countries including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, New Zealand, and Romania participated in the competition.

	As a result of the competition, the Soviet chess player Korchnoi won the championship with 13 points, the Soviet player Nezhmetdinov won the second place with 12.5 points, and the Soviet player Kholmov and the Czechoslovak player Filip won the third and fourth places respectively, each with 11 points.

    向共产主义前进的苏联人民
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央颁布决定
    再次减低食品和制成品的国家零售价格
    据塔斯社莫斯科三月三十一日讯：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会颁布了一项决定，宣布自一九五四年四月一日起再次减低食品和制成品的国家零售价格。这是一九四七年以来的第七次减价。
    根据决定，这次减低价格的物品共有十五大项。计面包、面粉和通心面制品的零售价格减低百分之五到十五；谷类和饲料减低百分之五到八；食品杂货类减低百分之十到二十；纺织品减低百分之十到二十；服装、针织品和头巾帽类减低百分之七到二十五；鞋类减低百分之七到二十；零星服饰用品减低百分之十到二十；肥皂、香水和化妆品减低百分之十到二十；文化用具和玩具减低百分之十到十五；瓷器、陶器和玻璃器皿减低百分之十到十五；家庭用具减低百分之十到二十；建筑材料减低百分之十到三十；火柴和石油产品减低百分之二十到四十四点五；体育用品和其他制成品减低百分之五到十五；医药和卫生用品减低百分之十到十五。

    此外，在以优惠价格征购原棉、蚕茧、麻产品、亚麻、大麻时，向交售这些作物的集体农民出售谷物和油饼的价格，还应比零售价格低百分之十。
    展开劳动竞赛迎接“五一”
    苏联古比雪夫水电站和许多工厂职工发起社会主义劳动竞赛，迎接五一国际劳动节。古比雪夫水电站的竞赛是由正在建筑通航系统的共青团工地的职工发起的。他们决定在四月二十五日完成今年头四个月的建筑和装配计划，在水闸上浇灌三万三千公方混凝土，完成土工计划百分之一百一十，并降低混凝土工程的成本百分之二到百分之五。竞赛号召提出后，水电站工地上的工人纷纷响应。各地厂矿也纷纷展开了五一竞赛。在乌克兰，萨坡罗什炼钢厂的平炉车间在胜利完成选举日的节日竞赛之后，立即在总结会议上提出五一节的竞赛。职工决定在三月份和四月份再超计划给国家生产数千吨钢。西伯利亚矿井的矿工提前九天完成了第一季度计划。他们决定在四月份至少超额多开采三列车煤，并减低每吨燃料的成本。
    春到古比雪夫水电站工地
    这几天，伏尔加河流域正是早春天气，古比雪夫水电站工地上呈现一片活跃的气象。几百台机器和机械，在拒水堰保护着的电力厂基坑中工作着。最近，伏尔加河右岸的自动混凝土工厂的第二部分开工了。汲泥机已在拦河坝的左翼堆砌了数千公方泥土。钢筋混凝土的溢洪道大堤的混凝土浇灌工作正在胜利进行。一九五五年，钢筋混凝土的溢洪道大堤将把伏尔加河的水位提高二十六公尺，那时，地图上就将出现一个长五百公里宽四十公里的“古比雪夫海”。工地上工作越来越紧张了。下水闸明年就将通航了，目前正在进行混凝土浇灌工作。上水闸也正在进行闸舱底部的工作，以便浇灌混凝土。
    伏尔加河上紧张防汛
    斯大林格勒水电站的建筑者正紧张准备预防春汛。伏尔加河的春汛很快就要奔流到离河心很近的电力厂基坑了。目前基坑延展七十五公顷，基坑的拒水堰将要支撑春汛和流冰的巨大压力。现在掘土机从基坑掘出的泥土全都用来加强拒水堰和拦河坝。拦河坝上将堆砌一百万公方以上的泥土。在春汛防御准备工作快要结束的时候，数百辆汽车自伏尔加河右岸载运沙石到基坑，目前基坑中已浇灌了将近四千公方混凝土。
    大批企业提前完成生产任务
    苏联有几千个工业企业已经提前胜利完成了第一季度的生产计划。根据最近从莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、维切布斯克、奥勒尔及其他城市传来的消息，这些城市的机器制造厂都已超额完成了今年第一季度农业机器和备件的生产计划。其中，哈尔科夫的拖拉机装配工厂第一季度的生产任务已提前十天完成，现在已按四月份的计划生产了几十台拖拉机。顿巴斯、乌拉尔和莫斯科附近煤区的许多煤矿，也纷纷提前完成了今年头三个月的生产计划。各地轻工业企业也超过第一季度的生产计划为国家多生产了许多产品。莫斯科加里宁毛纺厂、五一毛纺厂、“包曼”织袜工厂等企业，都完成了第一季度的生产任务。加里宁毛纺厂已经超过本季度生产计划工作好多天了，到三月底该厂将超额生产价值二千二百万卢布的上等毛线。在外喀尔巴阡、诺夫哥罗德和基洛夫州，也有许多生产日用品的工厂和木材工业企业提前完成了第一季度的生产计划。
    建筑新的医院和诊疗所
    今年苏联医疗事业还将进一步发展，今年头两个月内苏联政府拨作建筑新的医院、诊疗所和疗养机构的费用就有二十五亿卢布。在俄罗斯联邦，莫斯科今年要建筑十二个大医院，利森要建筑三个医院和若干诊疗所，斯大林格勒、基洛夫、奥勒尔等城市也都在建筑大医院。乌克兰的罗夫州在今年年底以前要建成十七个新医院，哈尔科夫正在建筑六个新医院。
    极北地区的“空中救护站”
    苏联边远地区医疗事业的发展是很迅速的。例如在十月革命前，广大的极北地区只有七个医院和二十五个护士站，总共只有十一个医生和二十五个护士。但在苏维埃时代，那里就开设了将近二百个医院、一千个护士站和助产站、十二个附有病房的特别诊所、几十个产科医院，以及许多诊疗所、卫生站、流行病防治站和空中救护站。空中救护站对边远地区居民的医疗服务起着很重要的作用。仅在去年一年，苏联极北地区空中救护站的医务人员就给病人实行了六百多次手术，护理了二万七千多个病人，把两千多个病人用飞机运到区或州中心的医院中去进行医疗。此外，极北地区的医务工作人员不但在固定医疗机构中为有固定住所的居民服务，而且还组成许多流动医务工作队到游牧地带为牲畜饲养者服务。
    莫斯科等地扩建电影制片厂
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、第比利斯、塔什干、巴库和里加等地，都在兴建和扩建电影制片厂。莫斯科电影制片厂在扩建后产量可增加三倍，每年摄制的彩色故事片达四十部；列宁格勒电影制片厂的产量也将增加一倍。
    苏联今年计划摄制大批影片，其中仅新闻纪录影片就有一百四十八部，其中有反映农业发展和集体农庄生活的影片七十二部，反映贸易发展和介绍贸易机构先进工作方法的影片七部，描绘库页岛、千岛群岛等地风光的彩色旅行风景影片十二部。此外还有关于共产主义建设工程、工业发展和人民的文化、艺术、体育活动的纪录片。
    新的彩色立体影片博得好评
    苏联的立体电影和电视电影在逐步发展中。莫斯科和基辅已建立了立体电影院，列宁格勒、新西伯利亚、斯维德洛夫斯克、第比利斯、巴库、塔什干、索契、敖德萨和罗夫等地，将在今年设立立体电影院。苏联的立体影片的摄制技术和表现方法逐渐改进，立体效果随之加强。例如最近在列宁格勒上演的新彩色立体影片“阿乐哥”（根据俄国作曲家斯·拉赫曼尼诺夫的同名歌剧改编而成），就博得了好评，影片在运用立体效果表现原作品思想和艺术意图方面有新的创造。电视电影事业是随着电视事业的发展而前进的。在已经建立了电视播送站的莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅，都在利用电视播送站放映电视电影。
    苏联选手获国际象棋赛前三名
    国际象棋比赛于二月二十四日至三月二十六日在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特举行。这次比赛是由罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议体育委员会主办。参加比赛的有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利、瑞典、比利时、意大利、新西兰、罗马尼亚等九个国家的十八名象棋选手。
    比赛的结果，苏联的象棋选手科奇诺伊以十三分获得冠军，苏联选手涅日米特吉诺夫以十二点五分得亚军，苏联选手科尔莫夫和捷克斯洛伐克选手菲利普分别获得了第三名与第四名，他们每人各得十一分。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
