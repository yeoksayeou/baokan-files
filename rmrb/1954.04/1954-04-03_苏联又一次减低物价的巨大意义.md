The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a decision on March 31st, announcing the seventh price reduction since 1947, effective April 1st of this year. This price reduction covers fifteen major categories of goods, including hundreds of items necessary for people's daily life, such as food, textiles, clothing, shoes, accessories, cultural supplies, household goods, building materials, medical and health supplies, and other manufactured products. The price reduction ranges from 5% to 44.5%. As a result, the people of the Soviet Union will receive a direct benefit of 20 billion rubles in one year. Including the previous six price reductions, the benefits that the Soviet people have received from price reductions after the war have reached more than 400 billion rubles. Before this new price reduction, the prices of daily necessities in the Soviet Union had already been reduced by 55% compared to 1947. Now, the Soviet people can buy more than twice as much with the same number of rubles as they could six or seven years ago. The purchasing power of the Soviet people has further increased, their real income has increased, and their material life is even better.

The Soviet policy of reducing prices is not a temporary or transitional measure, but one of the main foundations of the entire Soviet economic activity and is the result of the boundless concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for the welfare of the people. The Soviet Party and government regard the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet working people as the most important goal and task, and reducing prices is the main way to achieve this goal. Comrade Stalin said at the voters' meeting in the Stalin constituency of Moscow on February 9, 1946, when talking about the important tasks after the war: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union "pays special attention to expanding the production of daily necessities and raising the living standards of workers by consistently reducing the prices of all goods."

The repeated price reductions in the Soviet Union fully demonstrate its great achievements in developing the economy and demonstrate the growth of its strong economic strength.

The Soviet industry has undergone rapid and enormous development during the post-war period. It has not only been fully restored but has also greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1940, increasing by one and a half times. In the last four years alone, the Soviet Union has built 2,500 industrial enterprises. The increase in industrial output during the post-war period is even greater than the total annual industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1940. In 1953, the Soviet Union produced 38 million tons of steel, 320 million tons of coal, 52 million tons of oil, and 133 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The output of means of production has increased by more than two times compared to pre-war. The tremendous development of heavy industry has made it possible for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government to propose and gradually solve a very important task at the current stage of building communism, namely, to greatly develop agriculture, promote the rapid rise of food and daily necessities, and to significantly improve the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people.

The series of measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Council of Ministers after September last year to further develop agriculture and the daily necessities industry, and to further develop trade, marked a new stage in the development of the Soviet socialist economy. In 1953, about 300 new daily necessities factories were put into production in the Soviet Union. The original food industry and light industry enterprises widely obtained new-style machinery and equipment, and part of the strength of heavy industry and the defense industry was used to produce the items needed by residents. In this way, from the second half of 1953, the production of daily necessities in the Soviet Union began to grow rapidly. The production of daily necessities and food such as woolen fabrics, knitwear, sausages, confectionery, beer, and cigarettes exceeded the original annual plan. Fabrics, silk fabrics, woolen coats, fashionable shoes, canned meats, chocolates, etc., which are liked by the Soviet people, were produced in large quantities in 1953, and their quantity increased by about 12% to 70-80% compared to 1952.

Along with the increase in the production of daily necessities, the Soviet trade system obtained goods worth 33 billion rubles more than stipulated in the annual plan in 1953. In general, the goods sold to residents in 1953 increased by 21% compared to 1952. The varieties of valuable, high-quality foods, daily necessities, and durable goods have expanded, and their output has increased. For example, the sales volume of butter increased by 36% in 1953 compared to 1952, silk fabrics by 45%, sewing machines - by 34%, vacuum cleaners - by more than double, motorcycles - by 55%, and automobiles - by 1.6 times.

In the process of rapidly increasing the production of daily necessities, the Soviet Union widely adopted new technologies and advanced operating methods, which greatly increased labor productivity, and the production costs of industrial products were continuously reduced. At the same time, as a result of the Soviet government's efforts to improve trade work, commodity circulation costs were greatly reduced. All of this provided conditions for the Soviet state to further reduce the prices of food and industrial manufactured products.

It can be seen that the annual reduction of commodity prices in the Soviet Union is the inevitable result of the proportional and planned development of the socialist economy. It fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist economic system.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Soviet people are advancing by leaps and bounds along the road of building communism. The Soviet national economy will continue to move towards new upsurges, and agriculture and the daily necessities industry will have rapid development in the next two or three years. As a result of cultivating 13 million hectares of barren and virgin land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and parts of the North Caucasus to expand the grain sowing area, the Soviet state will be able to obtain 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion poods of grain more in 1955. The increase in the output of technical crops such as cotton and sugar beets and the development of animal husbandry will provide the light industry and food industry with abundant raw material supplies and rapidly develop in the near future. By 1955, the total amount of major commodities obtained by the Soviet domestic market will increase compared to 1950 as follows: meat products - 2.3 times; animal oil - 1.9 times; sugar - 2.3 times; clothing - 2.4 times; furniture - 4 times; sewing machines - 5.1 times; bicycles - 5.5 times. Many items that were previously considered luxury goods, such as champagne and televisions, will also be greatly increased. Obviously, with the more sufficient supply of agricultural products and light industrial products and the continued reduction of production costs in the future, commodity prices will be more likely to decrease. The Soviet Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that from 1951 to 1955, various methods, including reducing prices, will be used to increase the real wages of workers and staff by at least 35%. The active labor of the Soviet people is opening up an unlimited source of increasing their own happiness.

The policy of reducing prices consistently implemented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government not only demonstrates their boundless concern for the welfare of the people, but also proves that the Soviet Union is consistently pursuing a peaceful foreign policy. Only a country that strives to develop a peaceful economy and improve the people's living standards can systematically reduce the prices of goods. Stalin said three years ago: "It is very clear that if the Soviet Union is not reducing but expanding civilian industries, not tightening but developing new large-scale hydropower stations and irrigation system construction projects, not stopping but continuing to implement the policy of reducing prices - at the same time, it is expanding the military industry and increasing the army, then it is impossible not to risk collapse."

The ruling groups of the United States and other capitalist countries are pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation and aggressive expansion, which only allows the monopoly capital groups to obtain the maximum profit, while the working people of these countries are becoming increasingly impoverished. This forms a strong contrast with the situation in the Soviet Union. Since 1947, the prices of bread and meat in the Soviet Union have been reduced by more than two-thirds; while in France, the prices of these items have doubled, in the United Kingdom, the price of bread has doubled and meat has increased by one and a half times. In the United States, food prices have risen by 65% after the war, and the real wages of workers have been constantly falling. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had to admit in his speech on January 12th of this year: "The total amount of our domestic and foreign security work expenses (should be read as arms expansion and war preparation expenses) reaches more than 50 billion U.S. dollars every year, resulting in a deficit of 9 billion U.S. dollars in the 1953 budget and a deficit of 11 billion U.S. dollars in 1954. These expenses are taken from taxes, which is equivalent to the tax amount during the war; the actual value of the U.S. dollar is constantly falling. Our allies are also equally burdened. If this continues, it will inevitably cause serious consequences in terms of budget, economy and society."

The new price reduction implemented by the Soviet Union once again vividly demonstrates the growth of the Soviet Union's economic strength and the happiness of the people's lives. This fact gives infinite encouragement to the people of our country and the people of various people's democratic countries who are building socialism. The people of all countries in the capitalist world also see from this once again that the Soviet Union is a fortress for defending world peace and safeguarding the security of the people of all countries, and therefore are convinced that their struggle for peace, national independence and labor rights can be victorious.

    苏联又一次减低物价的巨大意义
    陈有为
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央在三月三十一日发布决定，宣布从今年四月一日起，实行自一九四七年以来的第七次减低物价。这次减低价格的物品共有十五大项，包括人民日常生活所必需的食品、纺织品、衣着鞋类、零星服饰、文化用具、家庭用具、建筑材料、医药卫生用品和其他制成品达数百种之多。价格下降的幅度从百分之五到百分之四十四点五不等，苏联全国人民因此将在一年内获得二百亿卢布的直接好处。连同从前的六次减价，苏联人民在战后从减价方面所得到的好处已达四千亿卢布以上。在这次新的减价以前，苏联的日用品价格已比一九四七年降低了百分之五十五，现在苏联人民用同样数目的卢布可以买到比六、七年前多一倍多的东西。苏联人民的购买力进一步提高了，实际收入增加了，他们的物质生活是更加美好了。
    苏联减低物价的政策，并不是某种暂时的、过渡的措施，而是苏联整个经济活动的主要基础之一，是苏联共产党和苏联政府对于人民福利的无限关怀的结果。苏联党和政府把不断地提高苏维埃劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平，作为最主要的目的和任务，而减低物价则是达到这一目的的主要方法。斯大林同志一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科斯大林选区选民大会上讲到战后的重要任务时说：苏联共产党“特别加紧注意扩大日用品生产，用一贯减低所有一切货品价格的办法来提高劳动者底生活水准。”
    苏联的一再减低物价，充分地说明了它在发展经济方面所获得的巨大成就，说明了它的雄厚的经济力量的增长。
    苏联的工业在战后期间有了迅速的、巨大的发展，不仅已经完全恢复了，并且大大超过了战前一九四○年的水平——增加了一倍半。就在最近四年间，苏联已建设了二千五百个工业企业。在战后期间内所增加的工业产量就比一九四○年苏联全国全年的工业产量还要多。一九五三年，苏联生产了三千八百万吨钢，三亿二千万吨煤，五千二百万吨石油，一千三百三十亿瓩时的电力。生产资料生产的产量比战前增加了二倍多。重工业的巨大发展，使得苏联共产党和苏联政府有可能来提出并设法逐步解决在建设共产主义现阶段的一个十分重要的任务，即大大地发展农业，促进食品与日用品的迅速高涨，以显著地提高苏联人民的物质与文化生活水平。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在去年九月以后采取了进一步发展农业和日用品工业，进一步发展贸易的一系列措施，这标志着苏联社会主义经济发展到了新的阶段。在一九五三年，苏联有三百个左右新的日用品工厂投入生产，原有食品工业和轻工业企业广泛地获得新式的机器装备，并动用了重工业与国防工业的一部分力量来生产居民所需要的物品。这样，从一九五三年下半年起，苏联的日用品生产就开始迅速增长起来。毛织品、针织品、腊肠、糖果、啤酒、香烟等日用品和食品的生产都超过了原定的全年计划。为苏联人民所喜好的花布、丝织品、羊毛外衣、时髦鞋类、罐头肉类、巧克力糖等，在一九五三年均有大量的生产，其数量较一九五二年增加了百分之十二到百分之七、八十左右。
    随着日用品生产量的增加，苏联的贸易系统在一九五三年得到了价值比年度计划规定多三百三十亿卢布的商品。一九五三年售给居民的货物，总的说来比一九五二年增加了百分之二十一。那些贵重的、质量高超的食品、日用品和耐用品的品种扩大了，产量增加了。如牛油的销售量一九五三年比一九五二年增加百分之三十六，丝织品百分之四十五，缝纫机——百分之三十四，真空吸尘器——一倍多，机器脚踏车——百分之五十五，汽车——一点六倍。
    在迅速增加日用品产量的过程中，苏联广泛地采用了新技术与先进操作方法，使劳动生产率大大提高，工业品生产成本随之不断降低。同时，苏联政府努力改进贸易工作的结果，商品流通费用又大为减少。这一切都为苏维埃国家进一步减低食品与工业制成品价格提供了条件。
    由此可见，苏联商品价格的逐年减低，正是社会主义经济按比例地有计划发展的必然结果。它充分表现了社会主义经济制度的优越性。
    苏联人民在党和政府的领导下，正在大踏步地沿着建设共产主义的道路前进。苏联国民经济将不断地走向新的高涨，农业和日用品工业在最近二、三年内将有迅速的发展。在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索部分地区开垦熟荒地和生荒地，扩大谷物播种面积一千三百万公顷土地的结果，将使苏维埃国家在一九五五年内就能够多得到十一亿至十二亿普特的谷物。棉花、甜菜等技术作物产量的增加和饲畜业的发展，将使轻工业与食品工业得到丰足的原料供应而在最近期内迅速发展起来。到一九五五年，苏联国内市场所得的主要商品总量，将比一九五○年增加如下：肉类制品——二点三倍；动物油——一点九倍；糖——二点三倍；衣服——二点四倍；家具——四倍；缝纫机——五点一倍；自行车——五倍半。许多从前被认为是奢侈品的物品如香槟酒、电视机等，也都要大大增加。很显然，今后随着农产品与轻工业品的更加充分供应和生产成本的继续降低，商品价格将更有可能降低。苏联第五个五年计划规定，在一九五一——一九五五年内，将以包括减低物价在内的各种办法，至少使工人和职员的实际工资增加百分之三十五。苏联人民的积极性劳动，开辟着增进自己幸福的无限源泉。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府所一贯执行的减低物价的政策，不仅表现了对人民福利的无限关怀，而且也证明了苏联是在一贯地奉行着和平外交政策。只有为发展和平经济、提高人民生活水平而努力的国家，才有可能来系统地减低物品价格。斯大林在三年前就曾这样说过：“很显然，苏联不是削减而是扩大民用工业，不是紧缩而是发展新的大规模水力发电站和灌溉系统的建设工程，不是停止而是继续推行减低物价的政策——在这个时候，它如果同时又扩大军事工业和增加军队，那么要不冒崩溃的危险是不可能的。”
    美国和其他资本主义国家的统治集团奉行着扩军备战与侵略扩张的政策，结果只使垄断资本集团获得最大限度的利润，而这些国家的劳动人民则日益贫穷化。这和苏联的情况形成了强烈的对照。自一九四七年以来，苏联的面包和肉类的价格降低了三分之二以上；而在法国，这些物品的价格却提高为两倍，在英国，面包价格提高为两倍，肉类为一倍半。在美国，食物价格在战后上涨了百分之六十五，劳动者的实际工资不断下跌。美国国务卿杜勒斯在今年一月十二日的演说中，就不得不承认：“我们在国内与国外的安全工作经费（应读作扩军备战费用）总额每年达五百多亿美元，结果在一九五三年的预算中的赤字达九十亿美元，一九五四年的赤字将达一百十亿美元。这些经费是取之于赋税，这赋税额相当于战时的税额；美元的实际价值不断下跌。我们的盟国也同样地不胜负担。长此以往，势必将在预算、经济与社会方面造成严重的后果。”
    苏联所实行的新的减价，再一次生动地显示了苏联经济实力的增长和人民生活的幸福。这一事实，使正在建设社会主义的我国人民和各人民民主国家人民得到无限的鼓舞。资本主义世界各国人民也由此又一次看到苏联是保卫世界和平与维护各国人民安全的堡垒，因而确信他们争取和平、民族独立与劳动权利的斗争，是能够取得胜利的。
