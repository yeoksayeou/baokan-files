Tangshan Steel Plant Launches Campaign for Workers to Devise Production Increase and Savings Plans
    Striving to Nearly Double Labor Productivity Compared to Last Year
    [By Our Newspaper] The state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant recently launched a campaign to have workers discuss and formulate annual production increase and savings plans. According to preliminary plans, by the end of the year, it can increase production and save over 180 billion yuan for the state. Fulfilling this plan would effectively increase labor productivity by nearly double compared to last year.
  During the discussion of the plan, all full-time technicians and accountants in the plant participated in the groups, playing a significant role in helping workers formulate advanced plans. For example, when workers in the converter team of the steelmaking department discussed shortening smelting time and improving steel ingot quality, they put forward dozens of opinions. The full-time technicians summarized these opinions and incorporated them into the operating procedures. When the second shift of the steelmaking department discussed shortening smelting time, someone suggested shortening it by another 1.09 minutes, but some people did not pay attention to this suggestion. The accountant then calculated the amount of steel that could be smelted by shortening the time by 1.09 minutes, and that from the second quarter to the end of the year, if each shift could do this, it could produce 45 billion yuan worth of wealth for the country. Upon hearing this figure, the workers happily said, "Conquering time means having everything!"
    In order to implement the production increase and savings plans, the workers in each workshop revised their work plans and guarantee measures, raising the team plans a step further based on the March plans. In order to increase production, workers in the rolling mill department came up with a method of reducing downtime, which could produce one more steel bar every ten minutes, exceeding the original plan by one-fold. According to preliminary calculations, the value of the increased production for the whole year would be equivalent to over 7 billion yuan.
    In response to the key issues in the production of each workshop, the technology department formulated 37 specific technical organization measures plans and posted the dates to the workers, providing technical support for the production increase and savings plans.
    Currently, all employees in the plant have launched a labor emulation drive to "accumulate funds for the country and over fulfill the plan."

    唐山钢厂发动职工订出增产节约计划
    争取把劳动生产率比去年提高近一倍
    【本报讯】　国营唐山钢厂最近发动职工讨论和制订了全年增产节约计划。根据初步计划，到年底可为国家增产节约一千八百多亿元。完成这个计划，实际的劳动生产率就可比去年提高近一倍。
  在讨论计划时，全厂专职技术员和核算员都参加到小组中去，对工人制订先进计划起了很大作用。如炼钢部转炉组工人在讨论缩短冶炼时间和提高钢锭质量问题时，提出了几十条意见，专职技术员就把这些意见加以总结，列入了操作规程。炼钢部第二班讨论缩短冶炼时间时，有人提议再缩短一点零九分钟，有的人不重视这个意见；核算员就计算出缩短一点零九分钟的时间可炼多少钢的数目，从第二季到年底，如果每班能做到这一点，就可为国家增产价值四百五十亿元的财富。工人们听了这个数字，高兴地说：“战胜了时间就有了一切！”
    各车间的职工为了贯彻执行增产节约计划，修订了作业计划和保证措施，把小组计划在三月份的基础上提高了一步。轧钢部工人为了提高产量，想出用减少中断时间的办法，每十分钟可多产一根钢，超出原计划一倍，据初步计算，全年可增产的价值等于七十多亿元。
    技术科针对各车间生产中的关键问题，制定了三十七项具体的技术组织措施计划，并排定日期向工人公布，从技术上对增产节约计划加以支持。
    现在，全厂职工已展开“为国家积累资金，超额完成计划”的劳动竞赛。
