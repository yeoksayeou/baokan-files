	Don't Plow Under the Seedlings
	Liu Zhongwen from the Jiujiang Special District Trading Company in Jiangxi writes: Our company, in order to understand the rapeseed production situation this year, sent cadres to Jiujiang, Hukou, and other counties in late February for focused investigations. During the investigation, it was discovered that in some areas, due to excessive rainfall since the beginning of spring, coupled with untimely weeding and fertilization, the seedlings are not growing well, and rapeseed production may be reduced. Some local farmers are therefore preparing to plow the seedlings under and use them as green manure. I believe that under the current circumstances of insufficient oil crop production, local leading organs should pay attention to this issue, quickly take effective measures to prevent this negative practice by some farmers, and educate farmers to actively weed and fertilize to cultivate the seedlings well, in order to increase the production of oil crops.

    不要把菜苗翻掉
    江西九江专区贸易公司刘中文来信：我们公司为了了解今年的菜籽生产情况，曾在二月下旬派干部分赴九江、湖口等县进行重点调查。在调查中，发现部分地区由于入春以来雨量过多，再加上锄草、施肥不及时，菜苗生长得不怎么好，菜籽有减产的可能。当地某些农民因而准备把菜苗翻掉，当作绿肥用。我认为在目前油料作物生产不足的情况下，当地领导机关应该注意这个问题，迅速采取有效办法防止某些农民这种消极的做法，并教育农民积极锄草、施肥，把菜苗培植好，以增加油料作物的产量。
