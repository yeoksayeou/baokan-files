The Russian Federal Republic has held amateur art festivals in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of collective farmers and rural intellectuals from various regions, states, and autonomous republics of the Russian Federation participated in this festival. More than two thousand of the best singers, dancers, and musicians were selected to hold a final festival in Moscow's largest clubs and theaters. During the Moscow festival, outstanding folk artists and amateur art groups from the Russian Federation performed a variety of wonderful music and dance programs, including folk songs and dances, Russian classical literary works, and their own original works.

The amateur art festival fully demonstrated the extensive mass participation of the Russian people in amateur art activities and the high level of development of socialist rural culture. Currently, there are 120,000 art groups and 1.5 million amateur actors in the rural areas of the Russian Federation. During the selection festival held in the Chuvash Autonomous Republic, 25,000 people participated, and more than 20,000 people participated in the selection festival held in the Kursk Oblast. In the Kirov Oblast, the Ulma District Cultural Palace recently performed the opera "Ivan Susanin." In Siberia, the symphony orchestra composed of thirty rural amateur musicians from the Uralga Village Collective Farm was selected to participate in the final festival in Moscow. The most outstanding programs in the festival included: the 1,500-person chorus singing composer Muradeli's "March of the Soviet Patriots," Frolova and Deviatkina singing the duet from Tchaikovsky's opera "The Queen of Spades," the 700-person chorus singing "Thank You to the Party," "The Prosperity of Our Region," and peasant dances from northern Soviet Union, the Urals, Kuban, and other regions.

On April 1st, the Russian Federal Republic Rural Amateur Art Festival held its final grand performance at the Moscow Grand Theater. Malenkov, Molotov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Shvernik, Shatalin, Kosygin, and Malyshev all attended the performance. (Pictures attached)
