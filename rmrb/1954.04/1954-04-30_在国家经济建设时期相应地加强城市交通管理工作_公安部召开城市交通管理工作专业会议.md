In accordance with the National Economic Construction, Strengthen Urban Traffic Management
Ministry of Public Security Convenes Professional Conference on Urban Traffic Management
    The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government convened a professional conference on urban traffic management from the 13th to the 20th of April to study and resolve the issue of strengthening urban traffic management in accordance with the period of national economic construction.
    The conference affirmed the achievements of urban traffic management work in the past few years. Urban traffic management is directly related to the safety of national economic construction and the lives and property of the people. It bears extremely important responsibilities in maintaining urban public order, facilitating transportation, and ensuring traffic safety. In the past few years, in order to establish and consolidate urban traffic order, public security organs at all levels have concentrated scattered markets and stalls affecting traffic or designated them to fixed locations in many cities, and have vigorously cleared obstacles affecting transportation. According to statistics from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing alone, more than 18,800 such obstacles were removed. At the same time, the "Provisional Rules for Urban Land Traffic Management" were implemented, unifying traffic command throughout the country, and repeated traffic safety publicity and education work was carried out to the general public, enabling the general public to initially develop good habits of abiding by traffic rules. Public security organs at all levels have also worked with relevant departments to vigorously manage various vehicles and organize and educate drivers. Many cities have managed tricycles, reasonably stipulated prices, and planned parking places, overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of tricycles wandering around and hindering traffic order. The Public Security Bureau of the Anshan Municipal People's Government went deep into various transportation departments to investigate and understand the storage and use locations of various materials, effectively grasped the types and quantities of transportation vehicles, specifically planned and adjusted driving routes and driving times, and appropriately allocated traffic police, thus ensuring traffic safety and facilitating transportation. In the past few years, public security departments at all levels have also done a lot of work in rectifying and strengthening the ranks of traffic police, so that this team has achieved initial purity and consolidation in terms of organization and ideological style. The number of Communist Party members among the traffic police in Beijing increased nearly sixfold in 1953 compared to 1950, and the number of Communist Youth League members increased ninefold during the same period. Many model heroes and figures who actively studied their profession and had important creations and resourcefulness and bravery have also emerged among traffic police in various places. The traffic police at the Sanwei Road post in Shenyang City created the experience of "fast vehicles not stopping, slow vehicles not piling up, and pedestrians not waiting," with flexible command and a kind service attitude, and no accidents occurred in more than eleven months. The No. 37 traffic command post in Shanghai has not had a traffic accident since the end of 1952.
    After reporting and discussion, the conference clarified the tasks of urban traffic management work in the future and resolved some major issues in business construction. According to the guidelines and tasks of the Second National People's Police Public Security Work Conference, the conference believes that the task of urban traffic management work should be: relying on the masses, combining the strength of all parties, conscientiously implementing the "Urban Land Traffic Management Rules," improving traffic command and traffic facilities, strengthening vehicle management, further carrying out regular and in-depth publicity and education work for drivers and the general public, vigorously preventing and reducing traffic accidents, and creating more favorable conditions for facilitating transportation and ensuring traffic safety. The conference also believes that the key to completing the above tasks lies in making the vast number of cadres and police correctly understand the relationship between traffic management work and national economic construction and its important significance, and clearly establishing the unified thinking of facilitating transportation and ensuring traffic safety. The conference also discussed and revised the "Urban Land Traffic Management Rules," which will be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

    在国家经济建设时期相应地加强城市交通管理工作
    公安部召开城市交通管理工作专业会议
    中央人民政府公安部十三日到二十日召开的城市交通管理工作专业会议，研究和解决了在国家经济建设时期相应地加强城市交通管理工作的问题。
    会议肯定了过去几年来城市交通管理工作的成绩。城市交通管理工作直接关联着国家经济建设和人民生命财产的安全，它在维护城市治安、便利交通运输、保证交通安全上担负着极其重大的责任。几年来，各级公安机关为了建立和巩固城市交通秩序，曾在许多城市内把影响交通的零散市场和摊贩集中起来或指定到固定地点，并大力清除了影响交通运输的障碍物。仅据北京、天津、上海、南京四个城市的统计，共拆除这种障碍物一万八千八百多处。同时，各地执行了“城市陆上交通管理暂行规则”，统一了全国的交通指挥，并向广大群众反复地进行了交通安全的宣传教育工作，使广大群众初步养成了遵守交通规则的良好习惯。各级公安机关还协同有关部门大力进行了对各种车辆的管理和对驾驶人员的组织教育工作。不少城市对三轮车进行了管理，合理地规定了价目，规划了停车处，克服了三轮车到处游荡妨害交通秩序的混乱现象。鞍山市人民政府公安部门曾深入到各运输部门调查了解各种物资的储存和使用地点，切实掌握运输车辆的种类和数量，具体规划和调整了行车路线和行车时间，适当地配置交通民警，因而保证了交通安全和便利了交通运输。几年来，各级公安部门在整顿和加强交通民警队伍方面，也做了不少工作，使这支队伍在组织上，思想作风上达到了初步的纯洁和巩固。北京市交通民警中的共产党员，一九五三年比一九五零年增加了将近六倍，在同一时间内，青年团员增加了九倍。各地交通民警中还涌现出不少积极钻研业务并有重要创造和机智勇敢的功臣模范人物。沈阳市三纬路岗台的交通民警创造了“快车不停、慢车不堆、行人不等”的经验，指挥灵活，服务态度和蔼，十一个多月内没有发生任何事故。上海市第三十七号交通指挥岗台从一九五二年年底以来就没有发生过交通事故。
    会议经过报告和讨论，明确了今后城市交通管理工作的任务和解决了业务建设中一些主要问题。根据第二次全国民警治安工作会议的方针任务，会议认为城市交通管理工作的任务应该是：依靠广大群众，结合各方面的力量，认真贯彻执行“城市陆上交通管理规则”，改进交通指挥和交通设施，加强车辆管理，进一步开展驾驶人员及广大群众的经常的深入的宣传教育工作，大力防止和减少交通事故，为便利交通运输，保障交通安全创造更有利的条件。会议并认为，完成上述任务的关键在于必须使广大干部和民警正确认识交通管理工作和国家经济建设的关系及其重要意义，明确树立便利交通运输和保障交通安全统一的思想。会上还讨论和修改了“城市陆上交通管理规则”，报请政务院批准后公布施行。   （新华社）
