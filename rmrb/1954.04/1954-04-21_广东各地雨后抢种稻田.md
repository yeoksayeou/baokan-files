    Guangdong Areas Rush to Plant Rice Paddies After Rain
    Widespread rainfall has recently occurred in various parts of Guangdong, and the threat of drought has been largely relieved. At present, farmers are seizing the favorable opportunity of rainwater storage and irrigation to carry out rapid plowing, harrowing, and rushing to plant. The Yuezhong District has also organized twelve spring plowing inspection teams to go to various counties to specifically assist in leading farmers in drought resistance, water storage, seedling protection, and rushing to plant. In areas such as eastern and central Guangdong, where the drought was originally more severe, most areas have overcome the threat of the spring drought and completed the early rice sowing; in the Yuebei District, where the season is later, harrowing and rice transplanting have now begun; in some areas with less rainfall, efforts are also being made to find water sources and pump water to strive for timely sowing. At the same time, in order to prevent the possible recurrence of drought, various localities are actively leading farmers to repair mountain ponds and reservoirs, and carry out water storage and drought prevention work.

    广东各地雨后抢种稻田
    广东各地最近普遍降雨，旱灾的威胁已基本解除。目前农民正抓紧雨后蓄水灌田的有利时机，进行快犁、快耙和抢种工作。粤中区还组织了十二个春耕检查小组，分赴各县，具体协助领导农民抗旱、蓄水、保秧、抢种等工作。原来旱灾比较严重的粤东、粤中等地，大部地区已克服了春旱的威胁，完成了早稻下种；季节较迟的粤北区，目前也已开始耙田插秧；部分降雨较少的地区，也正抓紧找水源，车水戽水，争取及时下种。同时，各地为了防止旱灾的可能再度袭击，正积极领导农民检修山塘水陂，进行蓄水防旱工作。（吴尔祥）
