(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 8) Confessions of Kim Jung-geum and Jeon Hong-woo, U.S. armed personnel who violated the armistice agreement and intruded into our area for hostile acts, captured by our side on April 3 and 5.

Kim Jung-geum's Confession

My name is Kim Jung-geum, a Korean national, seventeen years old this year, formerly a member of the U.S. "BMC" unit. On April 3, 1954, the U.S. side sent me across the military demarcation line to intrude into the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side to carry out hostile acts, and I was captured by the Korean-Chinese side.

I joined the "BMC" unit on December 25, 1953. This unit had one U.S. Army Captain, one U.S. Army Warrant Officer, and two American soldiers, in addition to nearly fifty Korean personnel. The mission of this unit was to specifically dispatch personnel to the Korean-Chinese side's area to carry out hostile acts and collect military intelligence.

After I joined this unit, I received nearly three months of training at the unit's station beside the railway about two kilometers north of Munsan, from January 5 to March 30, 1954. In addition to military training and learning methods of obtaining military intelligence, I also focused on studying maps of the vicinity of Kaesong.

At 18:30 on April 3, a U.S. military officer issued automatic rifles and carbines to Kim Cheol, Kim Kyung-rip, one surnamed Min, one surnamed Lee, and myself, a total of five people, and led us in a medium-sized truck to the vicinity of Baekhak-dong. After getting out of the car, the U.S. military officer told the five of us to cross the military demarcation line and intrude into the Korean-Chinese side's area to carry out hostile acts and collect intelligence. He also agreed with us on a password. When we returned after completing the mission in five days, if we encountered U.S. military police, we should shout: "CAPTAINBLACK", and we would be protected.

The five of us crossed the military demarcation line at about 19:00 on the 3rd. At about 20:50, when we were nearly one kilometer away from the military demarcation line, we encountered civil administration police from the Korean-Chinese side. They inquired who we were, and Kim Cheol and others shot at the Korean-Chinese civil administration police. When the Korean-Chinese civil administration police returned fire, Kim Kyung-rip was killed, I was captured, and the other three disappeared.

Jeon Hong-woo's Confession

My name is Jeon Hong-woo, a Korean national, twenty-four years old this year, formerly a member of the 21st Detachment of the "90" Area Team of the U.S. "HID" unit. On April 5, 1954, the U.S. side sent me to intrude into the Korean-Chinese side's area to carry out hostile acts, and I was captured by the Korean-Chinese side.

I joined the 21st Detachment on March 11, 1954. The 21st Detachment had a total of more than twenty people, led by a Captain surnamed Fang from the Syngman Rhee army. The mission of this unit was to dispatch personnel to the Korean-Chinese side's area to carry out hostile acts and collect intelligence.

After joining this unit, I received more than half a month of training, learning shooting and methods of obtaining military intelligence.

On April 4, Captain Fang dispatched Seo Hak-seon, Jeong Ki-joon, Lee Sa-ryong, Ryu Bok-soo, and myself, a total of five people, to intrude into Bonghwari, about ten kilometers southeast of Yeon'an near the Han River estuary in the Korean-Chinese side's area, to carry out armed attacks or kidnap government personnel and civilians. Captain Fang also issued us three carbines, several ropes, and several hand grenades.

On the same day, at 21:00, the five of us departed from Sajing-dong on Gyodong Island, the location of the unit's station, and took a small motorboat specially used by the 21st Detachment to dispatch personnel to the Korean-Chinese side's area, sneaking across the Han River estuary and landing near Bonghwari. After landing, we walked forward for about 500 meters and encountered the Korean-Chinese side's defense forces. Ryu Bok-soo and I were captured, and the others escaped.

    被我方捕获的美方武装人员的供词
    【新华社开城八日电】四月三日及五日被我方捕获的违反停战协定、侵入我方地区进行敌对行为的美方武装人员金正今和全洪禹的供词。金正今的供词我名叫金正今，朝鲜籍人，今年十七岁，原系美方“BMC”部队人员。一九五四年四月三日，美方派我越过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面管辖的非军事区进行敌对行为时，被朝中方面捕获。
    我是在一九五三年十二月二十五日参加“BMC”部队的。这个部队里有一个美军上尉，一个美军准尉和两个美国兵，另外还有近五十名朝鲜籍人员。这个部队的任务就是专门派遣人员前往朝中方面地区进行敌对行为及搜集军事情报。
    我参加这个部队以后，从一九五四年一月五日至三月三十日在汶山北约二公里铁道旁边的部队驻地受了近三个月的训练，除了军事训练和学习探听军事情报的方法以外，还着重研究了开城附近的地图。
    四月三日十八时三十分，一个美军军官把自动步枪和卡宾枪发给金哲、金庆立、一个姓闵的、一个姓李的和我自己共五人，并且带领了我们乘坐一辆中型卡车，到了白鹤洞附近。下车以后，美军军官就叫我们五个人越过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对行为和搜集情报。他并和我们约好暗号，在五天后完成任务回来时，如遇见美方军警就喊：“卡不亭·不来克”（CAPTAINBLACK），这样就会得到保护。
    我们五个人在三日十九时左右越过军事分界线，二十时五十分左右时，我们在离军事分界线将近一公里的地方，遇见朝中方面的民政警察，他们查询我们是什么人，金哲等人就向朝中方面民政警察射击，当朝中方面民政警察还击时，金庆立被打死，我被捉住，其他三人不知跑到那里去了。全洪禹的供词
    我名叫全洪禹，朝鲜籍人，今年二十四岁，原系美方“HID”部队“九○”地区队二十一派遣队人员。一九五四年四月五日美方派我侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对行为时，被朝中方面捕获。
    我是在一九五四年三月十一日参加二十一派遣队的，二十一派遣队共有二十余人，由李承晚军队的一姓方的上尉负责。这个部队的任务是派遣人员前往朝中方面地区进行敌对行为和搜集情报。
    我参加这个部队后，受了半个多月的训练，学习射击和探听军事情报的方法。
    四月四日，姓方的上尉派遣徐学善、郑基俊、李士龙、柳福秀和我自己共五人，侵入朝中方面地区延安东南约十公里靠近汉江口的烽火里，武装攻击或绑架政府人员和平民。姓方的上尉还发给我们卡宾枪三支、几条绳子和几个手榴弹。
    当天二十一时，我们五个人由部队驻地乔桐岛上的四井洞出发，乘坐二十一派遣队专门用来向朝中方面地区派遣人员的小汽船，偷渡过汉江口，在烽火里附近登岸。上岸后我们向前走了约五百公尺，就遇见了朝中方面的防军，我和柳福秀被捕获，其他人逃走了。
