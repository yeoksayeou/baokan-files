Utter Fabrication and Slander
　　Hu Sisheng

The U.S. Information Service broadcast a most vile slander on April 20, desperately attempting to distort the goals to be achieved by the Geneva Conference. In addition to wantonly distorting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, led by President Ho Chi Minh, for independence and peace, it fabricated many so-called "records" of "aggression" to attack the peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China.

In this slanderous speech, the U.S. Information Service even described Tibet and Xinjiang, which have always been Chinese territory, as "an independent Buddhist country" and "a resource-rich mountainous country," and fantasized that the People's Republic of China "seized" and "occupied" these two "countries." In addition, the U.S. Information Service also spread rumors that a "Communist Thai Liberation Army" "trained" by China was established in 1953.

From this, people can see how base the American slanderers have become. Tibet and Xinjiang have always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory, just as California and Georgia are an inseparable part of American territory. This is common knowledge for people with a little knowledge. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once refuted the absurd claim by foreign provocateurs that Tibet is not Chinese territory.

As everyone knows, the U.S. Information Service is the official news agency of the U.S. government, and its slanderous and fabricated acts, which are spurned by civilized humanity, are obviously an integral part of the U.S. government's policy. This not only exposes the hatred and hostility of the American ruling clique towards the Chinese people, but also exposes the U.S. government's foolish and arrogant activities of trying every possible means, even resorting to the most vulgar lies and fabrications, to carry out its aggression and subversion against the People's Republic of China.

As for the U.S. Information Service's fabrication of the so-called China "training" the "Communist Thai Liberation Army," it is entirely to cover up its ulterior motives of aggression. But this is in vain. The fact that is obvious to all at present is that the United States is expanding its interference in the Indochina War and is stepping up the formation of a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, seriously threatening the security of Southeast Asian countries. The Indian "National Herald" of April 16 said: "For the vast majority of millions of Asians who are not communists, if there are aggressors other than the French in Indochina, then this aggressor seems to be the United States, not China."

The U.S. Information Service openly stated that whether the Geneva Conference can achieve peace in Indochina depends on whether their fabricated "Communist aggression" is "stopped" as a "condition." It is well known that the American ruling clique has consistently attempted to use so-called "preconditions" to resist international consultations. Now, the "conditions" put forward by the U.S. Information Service are completely fabricated and therefore do not exist at all. This clearly proves that the United States is stepping up the creation of obstacles to the Geneva Conference, preventing the Geneva Conference from restoring peace in Indochina, and then shifting the responsibility for destroying the conference onto others in order to use it as an excuse to maintain international tensions. However, Asian public opinion has already seen this trick very clearly. The Ceylonese capital Colombo's "Tribune" weekly, in criticizing Dulles' slander against China, said: "He is determined to obstruct any agreement at the Geneva Conference, and he deliberately slanders in advance, wanting to shift the responsibility for destroying the conference in this way. But what is the basis for this slander? Everyone knows that it is the American imperialists, not the Chinese people, who sent planes to help the French aggressors massacre the people of Indochina. Facts show that this excuse cannot deceive anyone, especially the Asian people who have thoroughly seen the aggressive policy of the United States."

The people of Asia and the world are closely watching the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference. Any fabrication and slander by the American ruling clique will not succeed.

    彻头彻尾的捏造和诽谤
    胡思升
    美国新闻处四月二十日广播了一篇极为卑鄙的诽谤言论，竭力企图歪曲日内瓦会议所要实现的目标。它除了大肆歪曲胡志明主席所领导的越南人民争取独立和和平的正义斗争以外，更凭空捏造了许多所谓“侵略”的“记录”来攻击中华人民共和国的和平外交政策。
    美国新闻处在这篇诽谤言论中，竟然把从来就是中国领土的西藏和新疆，说成是“一个独立的佛教国的国家”和“一个资源丰富的山国”，并异想天开地胡诌什么中华人民共和国“夺取了”和“占领了”这两个“国家”。此外，美国新闻处还造谣说什么一九五三年成立了由中国“训练”的“共产党泰国解放军”。
    人们由此知道，美国诽谤家已经到了多么卑劣的地步。西藏和新疆从来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，正如加里福尼亚州和乔治亚州是美国领土的不可分割的一部分一样。这是稍有知识的人们的普通常识。印度总理尼赫鲁就曾驳斥过外国挑拨家所谓西藏不是中国领土的荒谬说法。
    大家知道，美国新闻处是美国政府的官方新闻机构，它这种为文明人类所唾弃的诽谤和捏造勾当，显然是美国政府的政策的组成部分。这不仅暴露了美国统治集团对中国人民的仇恨和敌视，而且暴露了美国政府正在千方百计地甚至不惜使用最下流的撒谎捏造的手段来进行其侵略和颠覆中华人民共和国的愚蠢而又狂妄的活动。
    至于美国新闻处捏造所谓中国“训练”“共产党泰国解放军”，完全是为了掩盖其不可告人的侵略目的。不过这是徒然的。目前人所共见的事实是，美国正在扩大干涉印度支那战争，并加紧拼凑东南亚和西太平洋军事联盟，严重地威胁着东南亚各国的安全。四月十六日的印度“国民先驱报”说：“对于大多数不是共产党的千百万亚洲人来说，如果除了在印度支那的法国以外还有侵略者的话，那么这个侵略者似乎就是美国，而不是中国。”
    美国新闻处公然说：日内瓦会议能否实现印度支那的和平，要以他们所捏造的什么“共产党的侵略”是否“停止”为“条件”。人所共知，美国统治集团一贯企图使用所谓“先决条件”来抵制国际协商。现在美国新闻处提出的“条件”，更是完全凭空编造出来的，因而是根本不存在的。这清楚地证明美国正在加紧制造日内瓦会议的障碍，使日内瓦会议不能恢复印度支那和平，然后把它破坏会议的责任推到别人身上去，以便用来作为借口以保持国际紧张局势。但是，对于这一诡计，亚洲舆论也已经看得很清楚了。锡兰首都科伦坡的“特兰”周刊在抨击杜勒斯对中国的诽谤时说：“他一心想阻挠在日内瓦会议上获得任何协议，他蓄意事先就进行诽谤，想这样来转嫁破坏会议的责任。但是这种诽谤有什么根据呢？每一个人都知道，派遣飞机去帮助法国侵略者屠杀印度支那人民的是美帝国主义者而不是中国人民。事实说明这种托辞骗不了任何人，尤其是骗不了已经彻底看清楚美国的侵略政策的亚洲人民。”
    亚洲和全世界人民都在密切注视着美国破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋活动。美国统治集团的任何捏造和诽谤都是不能得逞的。
