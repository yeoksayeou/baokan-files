Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 31st: According to Vietnam News Agency, at 7:00 AM on March 27th, the Vietnam People's Army ambushed a convoy of enemy armored transport vehicles on Route 5, about 20 kilometers southeast of Hanoi. According to preliminary reports, the People's Army destroyed ten enemy armored vehicles, annihilated a company and a platoon of the enemy's 3rd Mobile Group, and captured many enemy weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: The Vietnam People's Army, active in the Red River Delta, has rendered the French army's important transport line between Haiphong and Hanoi semi-paralyzed.

According to United Press, a spokesman for the French High Command admitted on the 28th that the Vietnam People's Army "has made it impossible for 50 percent of vital military supplies—including American aid—to be transported by road from the port of Haiphong to here (Hanoi)." At the same time, the railway line parallel to the highway is also frequently attacked. A French military spokesman admitted that recently, "heavily guarded trains running on the railway have derailed ten times." At present, this transport line can no longer maintain normal transportation. United Press said, "Supply trains only run during the day," and "the time for trains to run has been reduced to only five or six hours."

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam People's Army newspaper "People's Army Daily" published an article on the 26th, exposing the enemy's trick of using aircraft to transport ammunition and personnel to resupply the besieged French troops in Dien Bien Phu under the guise of evacuating the wounded.

The article said that on March 16th and 17th, enemy Dakota aircraft painted with the Red Cross symbol landed many times at the Muong Thanh airfield. In the spirit of humanitarianism, the Vietnam People's Army did not bombard these aircraft. However, on March 18th, the Vietnam People's Army troops stationed at a watchtower only a little over one kilometer from the enemy stronghold clearly saw the enemy use aircraft painted with the Red Cross symbol to drop ammunition for cannons and mortars; enemy troops in Muong Thanh who surrendered to the People's Army also confirmed this. Despite the enemy's shamelessness, the Vietnam People's Army still allowed the enemy's helicopters to land in Muong Thanh several times to carry back their wounded. But after March 20th, the enemy used several more helicopters to drop eight flamethrowers. On March 23rd, another helicopter transported a high-ranking French officer and several other personnel from Hanoi to Dien Bien Phu.

The article concluded that the above is the truth about the enemy's so-called evacuation of the wounded from Dien Bien Phu.

    越人民军在五号公路歼敌一个连和一个排
    “人民军队报”揭露敌人所谓撤退奠边府伤兵的真相
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：三月二十七日上午七时，越南人民军在河内东南约二十公里的第五号公路上伏击敌军的一支装甲运输车队。据初步消息，人民军击毁敌军装甲车十辆，歼灭敌军第三机动团的一个连和一个排，并缴获了敌军的许多武器。
    【新华社三十一日讯】活跃在红河三角洲的越南人民军已使海防至河内之间法军的重要运输线陷于半瘫痪状态。
    据合众社讯：法军总司令部发言人在二十八日承认，越南人民军“已使得百分之五十的重要军需品——包括美国的援助在内——不能自海防港经由公路运到这里（河内）来”。同时，与公路平行的铁路线也一样常常被袭击。一个法军军事发言人承认，最近，在“铁路上行驶的戒备森严的火车出轨十次”。目前，这条运输线已不能维持正常的运输。合众社说，“运输供应品的火车只是白天行驶”，并且“火车行驶的时间已减少到只有五、六小时”。
   【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军机关报“人民军队报”二十六日发表文章，揭露敌人以撤退伤兵为名，用飞机运送弹药、人员接济奠边府被围法军的勾当。
    文章说，三月十六日和十七日，漆着红十字标志的敌军达科他式飞机在芒清机场降落了许多次。越南人民军本着人道主义的精神，没有轰击这些飞机。然而在三月十八日，驻在离敌军据点只有一公里多的瞭望塔上的越南人民军部队清楚地看见敌人利用漆着红十字标志的飞机，丢下大炮和迫击炮所用的弹药；向人民军投降的芒清敌军也证实了这一点。尽管敌人这样无耻，越南人民军还是让敌人的直升飞机在芒清降落数次，载回他们的伤兵。但在三月二十日以后，敌人又利用若干架直升飞机投下八个火焰喷射器。三月二十三日，另一架直升飞机把一个法国高级军官和若干其它人员从河内运到奠边府。
    文章最后说，以上就是敌人所谓撤退奠边府伤兵的真相。
