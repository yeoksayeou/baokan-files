    Advancing on the Road of Agricultural Cooperativization
    Frequently Educate Members on the Two Roads
    Letter from Agricultural Labor Model Han Enlai: Our agricultural production cooperative has been established for two years, and no member has withdrawn in any year, but many people have requested to join. In addition to the cooperative producing more grain and increasing the income of members, the main reason is that we often pay attention to ideological education for members, so that our cooperative is consolidated ideologically.
    I remember when our mutual aid team was transformed into a cooperative in 1952, Chang Shougui, a wealthy household in the team (with three horses, a rubber-tired cart, and three laborers), reluctantly signed up with everyone. However, when discussing the valuation of carts and horses, he deliberately raised the price of the rubber-tired cart, wanting everyone not to absorb him into the cooperative so he could go it alone. We held three meetings of team members and also talked to him individually, and only then did he decide to join the cooperative. That summer, member Zhao Qin heard that doing business earned more money and proposed to take more than 80 million yuan of the cooperative's public accumulation fund to do business; some members also agreed with this idea. We organized members to discuss and criticize this kind of thinking that wanted to engage in speculative activities, which not only helped Zhao Qin realize his mistake but also improved the ideological understanding of the members.
    That year, although our cooperative suffered severe hail damage, because we concentrated our efforts on agricultural production, the income of each member increased compared to before, and they harvested one to two times more than the surrounding farmers. The cooperative also deposited 40 million yuan of public accumulation fund in the credit cooperative. As a result, many farmers requested to join our cooperative. Many members believed that the cooperative had accumulated a lot of wealth, and newcomers would want to take advantage of it, so they disagreed with absorbing new members. This view was criticized by the cooperative's leading cadres and some members. Niu Defang said, "We cannot forget our roots just because we have run the cooperative well! New members also join based on their labor. The more households the cooperative has, the greater the strength, and the better the production can be, and everyone can become more prosperous." In this way, everyone agreed to absorb those people into the cooperative!
      In 1953, when discussing the production plan, the cooperative decided to sell the surplus carts and horses according to production needs. However, some people disagreed and wanted to use the surplus carts and horses for speculative activities. This thinking was criticized at that time.
    Facts have proved over the past two years that our cooperative has improved production and the lives of its members because we have earnestly listened to Chairman Mao's words and constantly overcome the erosion of rich peasant ideology on us. In the future, our cooperative must strengthen ideological education for its members, improve their awareness, and advance along the socialist road to common prosperity pointed out by the Party!
    A Few Experiences of Mine as Cooperative Director
    Letter from Yuan Zhongwei of Huatianban Village, Kuixi Township, Sheng County, Zhejiang Province (written on his behalf by Huang Jian): Last year, when our agricultural production cooperative was established, I was elected as the director, and I felt very honored. Since then, I have often considered how to manage this nineteen-household collective well, increase the cooperative's output, and increase the income of members. Over the past year, I have had the following experiences in my work:
    As a director, one should always care about the interests of the members and help them overcome difficulties. When our cooperative was first established, most members were in high spirits, except for Yu Zhangfa and five other members who were not. After I learned about it, it turned out that their families had run out of food and could not borrow grain. I conducted education on unity and mutual assistance among the members with richer lives and mobilized them to lend 840 catties of grain to help the poor households solve their spring famine difficulties. After the early rice harvest, member Qiu Yanglao was dejected and repeatedly requested to withdraw from the cooperative. I had six individual talks with him and helped his family hold a family meeting before I learned that he had an internal illness and could not handle heavy work in the cooperative. I apologized to him for not considering his physical strength when assigning work and said that in the future, work should be assigned according to physical strength. He then happily and actively started working again.
    Careful calculation and saving expenses to increase the actual income of members is a crucial key to running a cooperative well. For example, when we first formulated our production plan last year, we only considered how to increase production without calculating costs. The cost of commercial fertilizer for each mu of land in the plan was as high as 25 catties of grain; for cultivating spring flowers alone, we planned to use 350 catties of fertile field powder and 700 catties of oil cake, totaling 2,100 catties of grain, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total investment. At this time, I thought of my past situation of blindly applying fertilizer and reducing income, so I mobilized the members to calculate and compare accounts and repeatedly study. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to accumulate more native fertilizer, reduce costs, and increase actual income; and a plan for accumulating native fertilizer was formulated. Therefore, our cooperative not only achieved a bumper harvest of an average of 726 catties of grain per mu last year, but also greatly reduced production costs, accounting for only 14 percent of the total income. As another example, after the summer harvest, many members wanted to blindly expand public property and prepared to add a large number of farm tools, build brick kilns to engage in sideline occupations, and build five new houses as offices and farm tool storage rooms. After calculation, it would cost more than 2 million yuan just to build five houses, excluding tree materials and labor. At that time, I thought that the cooperative was only in its first year, and the members' economy was not yet prosperous. Doing so would inevitably make the cooperative's scale large, expenses high, and foundation empty, affecting the consolidation and improvement of the cooperative. Therefore, I insisted on tightening expenses and conducted patient persuasion and education for the members. Through careful calculation, not only was blind construction prevented, but also daily expenses were saved compared to before.
    As a director, one must also lead by example and lead the members to overcome difficulties. Last year, when the drought was tense, the members felt exhausted and lacked confidence. At that time, it was the time of bowl water and bowl grain, the critical moment for the success or failure of the year's production. I took the lead in fighting the drought day and night, leading everyone to establish the determination to fight the drought to the end, and finally overcame the threat of 54 days of drought. Just after the drought ended, there were several nights of heavy rain. Although I had not slept for several nights in a row, I was deeply afraid that the flood would collapse the embankment and the cooperative would suffer losses, so I ran to Shangshakeng that night and saw that the water was indeed very fierce, and the embankment was in danger of being washed away. I immediately rushed back, woke up League member Yuan Shuilao to mobilize the members, and first went to block the breach myself. After a night of fighting, we finally blocked the water hole and avoided losses. However, it is not possible to do a good job in production by relying on one person alone; it is also necessary to promote democracy and discuss matters with everyone. During the spring plowing last year, the cooperative's production content was very complicated, including transplanting rice seedlings, raising silkworms, grazing cattle, and picking tea, etc. The work was always not scheduled properly, and taking care of this would mean neglecting that. I mobilized each member to find solutions, and as a result, they came up with the method of grouping and dividing work and competition between groups, which greatly improved labor efficiency.
    How I Serve as a Production Team Leader
    Letter from Guo Tingyu, Production Team Leader of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative, Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province (written on his behalf by Huo Guishu, Wu Jinshan, and Guo Ligong): In 1953, our production team contracted to plant 85.3 mu of land, with an average yield of 405 catties per mu. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, it was selected as the cooperative's model team and received a banner. Now I will talk about my experiences as a production team leader.
    When everyone elected me as the team leader in 1952, especially after the task of contracting work and production in the cooperative was assigned to the team, I felt a great responsibility. At that time, I firmly remembered what Comrade Guo Yu'en often said to me: be fair and selfless in everything you do at work. During the autumn plowing last year, because it had not rained thoroughly for three months, the ground was so hard that it was difficult to plow. Fearing that the livestock would be exhausted, the team members were unwilling to start. At this time, I drove my own livestock to plow the land. Seeing me do this, the team members followed suit and quickly finished plowing the team's land, and also led and helped other teams in the entire cooperative to complete the task of plowing more than 400 mu of autumn land in winter on schedule. When allocating work hours, our team adopted the method of rotating light and heavy work, taking care of the elderly and those with weak physical strength. For example, during the autumn harvest, the old men were in charge of cutting grain and picking corn, while the young and strong transported it back. This gave play to the team members' enthusiasm for labor and enabled the autumn harvest plan to be completed ahead of schedule.
    As a team leader, one must also be fair and selfless when dealing with problems between teams and cannot have departmentalism. For example, last year in July, when using floodwater to irrigate the land on a dark night, the land contracted by our team was close to the water source, and some team members advocated irrigating one piece at a time from top to bottom. At that time, I thought: doing so would make the people in other teams wait all the time, and if they could not irrigate their land, they would harvest less grain in the autumn; wouldn't it be better to open the canal so that each team could irrigate quickly? Everyone felt that my opinion was correct, so they decided to do so. The team members from other teams praised me for being fair and selfless. In this way, more than 100 mu of autumn land was irrigated, and all of them achieved bumper harvests in the autumn.
    To lead the team well, enthusiasm alone is not enough; one must also master production technology. Knowing that my technology was not as good as others, I earnestly and humbly learned and often asked experienced farmers for advice. Last year, when the ground was hard and difficult to plow during the autumn plowing, I went to the technical committee member, the old man Li Xicun, for research. He patiently told me: "Plowing finer will save effort, and the clods will be smaller, and seedlings will not be separated in the spring." I tried it in the field and it was indeed correct, so I spread this technology within the team. For example, after hearing the old farmer say that "thinning seedlings is like applying fertilizer," I paid attention not only to pulling the land thoroughly but also to keeping the best seedlings, so that the crops grew lushly. After becoming a team leader, I not only led the team's work well, but also learned the technology of plowing, planting, hoeing, weeding, applying fertilizer according to the land, close planting, warm soup seed soaking, threshing, and grafting various fruit trees. The agricultural production cooperative is really a good school for me to learn technology!
    How Our Cooperative Leads Mutual Aid Teams
  　Letter from Bai Fengshan, Director of Baifengshan Agricultural Production Cooperative (Provincial Special Model Cooperative), 15th District, Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province (written on his behalf by Wang Peiji, Liu Guangjin, and five others): Our cooperative was established during the spring plowing last year. At the beginning, our understanding of "agricultural cooperatives should lead the great development of mutual aid teams" was not clear. Shortly after the establishment, we had opinions with the masses outside the cooperative: on the one hand, some members looked down on the masses outside the cooperative, saying that they were backward; on the other hand, because our leaders lacked experience, there was a lot of idling and missed work after the establishment of the cooperative, and the masses outside the cooperative were not convinced by our cooperative. In this way, the two sides became more and more estranged, and even the members and team members did not communicate with each other. Later, I and other cadres in the cooperative studied this situation and felt that the main reason was that we did not do enough to take the lead in uniting the masses outside the cooperative and educating the members to actively unite the masses outside the cooperative. Therefore, we held a meeting to educate the members on uniting the masses outside the cooperative to advance together on the road of agricultural cooperativization, and criticized the arrogant and complacent thinking of looking down on the masses outside the cooperative. After the meeting, in addition to the cooperative cadres regularly dividing work and contacting various mutual aid teams, the members also began to actively unite the masses outside the cooperative.
    Over the past year, we have established the following types of connections with mutual aid teams:
  1. Sharing farm tools; 2. Mutual learning and展开competition; 3. Mutual learning and展开competition; 3. Absorbing backbones of mutual aid teams to participate in meetings of educational significance within the cooperative, such as discussing plans, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, evaluating and rewarding model cooperative members, and discussing autumn harvest distribution plans; 4. Regularly holding meetings for cooperative members and the masses outside the cooperative to exchange opinions. Through these systems, the unity between our cooperative and the masses outside the cooperative has gradually strengthened. For example, at the first meeting for cooperative members and the masses outside the cooperative to exchange opinions, I first reviewed the shortcomings of not actively contacting the masses outside the cooperative in the past; the masses outside the cooperative also frankly gave the cooperative three opinions and reviewed their own shortcomings of satirizing the cooperative and not lending things to the cooperative in the past. From then on, the relationship between the cooperative and the masses outside the cooperative became one of mutual care and consideration. For example, once it rained heavily, and the cooperative was holding a democratic life meeting. The blind horse of the old man Yangtou outside the cooperative fell into the potato cellar. After the members knew about it, they quickly ran out, without regard for the rain outside and the slippery ground, got covered in mud, and helped him lift the horse out. As another example, cooperative member Wang Dianchen saw that the gourd sprinkler of Ning Weilin outside the cooperative was not working well and was embarrassed to borrow it from the cooperative, so he took the initiative to run back to solicit the cooperative's consent and then took the gourd sprinkler to lend it to him.
    In addition, our cooperative also paid attention to first setting an example at the beginning of each production season, and then organizing mutual aid teams to visit, and promoted the mutual aid teams to do a good job in production through competition. For example, last year, when promoting the Zhaoyuan new farming method, it was almost time to plant wheat, but the mutual aid teams had not yet moved. Our cooperative first planted a row of three seedlings according to the new farming method and organized more than 40 backbones from the whole village to visit the field, introducing the benefits of wheat with three seedlings in a row and early planting to prevent jaundice. After the visit, Guo Chunshan's team planted wheat with two plows, and Ning Weilin's team planted wheat with four plows. The next day, a total of 19 plows went down in the whole village.
    After studying the general line, the direction of the peasants in the whole village has become clearer, and the organized peasants account for more than 95 percent, and 42 percent of the households have joined the cooperative. From here, we deeply realize that to run a cooperative well and set a good example, we must not forget to bring along the mutual aid teams and individual farmers.

    在农业合作化的道路上前进
    经常向社员进行两条道路的教育
    农业劳动模范韩恩来信：我们农业生产合作社成立两年来，那一年都没有社员退社，可是却有不少人要求参加。这除了合作社多打了粮食、增加了社员的收入以外，主要是因为我们经常注意对社员进行思想教育工作，使我们的合作社从思想上得到了巩固。
    记得一九五二年我们互助组转成合作社的时候，组内的富裕户常守贵（有三匹马、一台胶皮车、三个劳动力）随着大家勉强报了名，但是在讨论车马作价的时候故意抬高胶皮车的价钱，想让大家不吸收他入社，自己去单干。我们召开了三回组员大会，还和他个别谈话，他这才下定决心入社了。这年夏天，社员赵勤听说做买卖挣钱多，就提出要拿社里八千多万元公积金去做买卖；有一些社员也同意这个意见。我们就组织社员对这种想搞投机活动的思想进行了讨论和批判，不光帮助赵勤认识了错误，也提高了社员们的思想认识。
    那年，我们合作社虽然受了严重的雹灾，可是由于集中力量搞好了农业生产，每个社员的收入都比以前有了增加，比周围的农民多收了一倍到两倍，社里还在信贷部存了四千万元的公积金。于是，有很多农民要求参加我们的合作社。不少社员认为社里攒了很多家当，别人进来要沾光，就不同意吸收新社员。这种看法受到了社的领导干部和一部分社员的批评。牛德芳说：“咱们搞好了合作社可不能忘本哪！新社员入社也是凭劳动，合作社户数多、力量大，生产才能搞得更好，大家才能更加富裕。”这样，大伙都同意吸收那些人入社啦！
      一九五三年在讨论生产计划的时候，社里根据生产需要，决定把多余的车马卖掉。有些人却不同意，想用多余的车马搞投机活动。这种思想当时就受到了批评。
    两年来事实证明，我们合作社由于认真听了毛主席的话，随时克服了富农思想对我们的侵蚀，生产才能提高，社员的生活也得到了改善。今后我们社更要加强对社员进行社会主义的思想教育，提高社员的觉悟，沿着党指给我们的大家富裕的社会主义道路前进！
    我当社长的几点体会
    浙江省嵊县逵溪乡花田坂村袁忠渭来信（黄坚代笔）：去年我们农业生产合作社成立时，我当选了社长，觉得很光荣。此后，我就经常考虑着怎样才能把这个十九户的大家当好、使合作社增加产量，社员增加收入。一年来，我在工作中有这样一些体会：
    当社长应该时刻关心社员利益，帮助社员克服困难。我们社刚建立时，大多数社员情绪很高，唯有俞樟法等五个社员情绪不高。我一了解，原来他们家里断了粮，借粮也没借到。我就向生活富裕的社员进行了团结互助教育，动员他们借出了八百四十斤谷子，帮助贫困户解决了春荒困难。早稻收割后，社员裘扬老垂头丧气，再三要求退社。我就和他作了六次个别谈话，又帮他家召开家庭会议，才了解到他身体有内病，在社里干重活吃不消。我就向他检讨了不应该分配工作时不照顾他的体力，以后要根据体力强弱分工分业。他又愉快积极地做起活来。
    精打细算，节约开支，使社员增加实际收入，是办好合作社的一个重要关键。如去年我们开始订生产计划时只考虑如何增加生产，而没有计算成本。计划中每亩地的商品肥料成本就达二十五斤谷子；仅培育春花一项，就准备用肥田粉三百五十斤、油饼七百斤，共折谷二千一百斤，占总投资的百分之八十以上。这时我想到自己过去盲目施肥而减少收入的情况，就发动社员算账对比，反复研究。最后大家一致同意多积土肥，降低成本，增加实际收入；并订出了积土肥的计划。因此，我社去年不仅获得每亩平均产谷七百二十六斤的大丰收，生产成本也大大减低，仅占总收入的百分之十四。再如夏田丰收后，不少社员想盲目扩大公有财产，准备大量添修农具，打砖窑搞副业，造五间新屋做办公室和农具储藏室。计算一下，光造五间房子，树料人工在外，就要二百多万元。当时我想办社才第一年，社员经济尚不宽裕，这样做一定会使社内摊子大、开支多、底子空，影响社的巩固提高。因此我坚持了紧缩开支的意见，向社员进行了耐心的说服教育。通过精打细算，不仅防止了盲目建设，而且日常开支也比以前节省了。
    当社长的还必须以身作则，带动社员来克服困难。去年抗旱紧张时，社员都感到精疲力竭，缺乏信心。那时正是碗水碗谷的时候，是一年生产的成败关头，我就一面自己日夜带头抗旱，带动大家树立了抗旱到底的决心，终于战胜了五十四天的干旱威胁。抗旱刚结束，连续下了几个晚上的大雨。我虽然连续数夜不睡，但深怕大水冲垮圩堤，合作社要遭受损失，就连夜跑到上沙坑，一看果然水势很凶，圩堤已有被冲去的危险。我立即赶回来，喊醒团员袁水老去发动社员，自己又先去堵住缺口。经过我们一夜的搏斗，才把水洞堵好，避免了损失。但是，光靠一个人生产也是搞不好的，还必须发扬民主，有事和大家商量。去年春耕时，社里生产内容很复杂，有插秧、养蚕、放牛、采茶等，活老是排不开，顾了这顾不了那。我就发动每个社员大家找办法，结果想出分组分业和组与组竞赛的办法，大大提高了劳动效率。
    我怎样当生产小组长
    山西省平顺县川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社生产小组长郭廷玉来信（霍贵树、吴金山、郭立功代笔）：一九五三年我们生产小组包种的八十五亩三分地，每亩平均产量四百零五斤。因此，秋收后被选为社的模范小组，得了锦旗一面。现在我来谈谈我当生产小组长的体会。
    一九五二年大家选我当小组长时，特别是社内包工包产的任务分配到小组以后，感到责任重大。当时我牢牢记住郭玉恩同志常对我说的工作中处处注意做到公正无私这句话。去年秋耕时，因为三个月没下过透雨，地硬得耕不动，怕累坏了牲口，组员们都不愿意动手。这时我就赶上自己的牲口掌犁下地。组员们见我这样做，也就跟着动开啦，很快就把组里的地耕完了，还带动并帮助全社其他组按期完成了四百多亩秋地冬耕任务。在分配活计时，我们组采取了轻重活计轮开做，照顾上年纪和体力弱的人；如在秋收时，老汉们专管割谷摘玉茭、青壮年往回运。这样就发挥了组员们的劳动积极性，使秋收计划提前完成。
    当小组长的在处理组与组之间的问题时也要公正无私，不能有本位主义思想。如去年七月一个黑夜天用洪水浇地时，我们组包种的地靠近水源，有些组员就主张从上到下，一块一块挨着浇。当时我想：这样做会使其它组的人一直等着，而且万一浇不上地，秋收时就要少打粮食；要是把渠道扒开，各组都能很快浇上，不是更好吗？大家感到我的意见正确，就决定这样做。别组的组员夸我办事公道，没有私心。这样一来就浇了一百多亩秋地，秋后都得了丰产。
    要把小组领导好，光凭热情是不够的，还要掌握生产技术。我知道自己技术不如别人，就认真地虚心地学习，经常向老农请教。去年秋耕时地硬不好耕，我就去找技术委员李喜存老汉研究。他耐心地告诉我：“犁的细些，就省力，而且圪垃既小，春天捉苗也留不下隔墒。”下地一试果然不差，我就在组内传播了这个技术。又如我听老农说“挑苗如上肥”的话后，就注意不仅拉透了地，还讲究把最好的苗留下来，使庄稼长的茂盛。当小组长后，我不但领导好了小组的工作，自己也学会了犁地、种地、锄地、耧地、因地施肥、密植、温汤浸种、扬场和接各种果树等技术。农业生产合作社真是我学习技术的好学校呀！
    我们社是怎样带动互助组的
  　黑龙江省拜泉县十五区白凤山农业生产合作社
  （省特等模范社）主任白凤山来信（王培基、刘广金等五人代笔）：我们社是去年春耕时建立起来的。开始，我们对于“农业社应该带动互助组大发展”的认识不明确，刚建社不久就和社外群众闹起意见来：一方面有些社员看不起社外群众，说他们落后；另一方面由于我们领导没经验，建社后窝工、误工很多，社外群众对我们社也不心服。这样，两下越来越生，甚至闹到社员与组员之间互不来往。后来，我和社里其他干部研究了这种情况，觉得主要原因还是我们带头团结社外群众并教育社员主动团结社外群众的工作做得不够。因此，我们就开会向社员进行了团结社外群众共同在农业合作化道路上前进的教育，并批判了那种看不起社外群众的骄傲自满思想。会后，除了社干部经常分工和各个互助组联系外，社员们也开始主动团结社外群众了。
    一年来，我们和互助组建立了这样几种联系：
  一、农具有无相通；二、互相学习，展开竞赛；三、社内有教育意义的会议吸收互助组骨干参加，如讨论计划、开展批评和自我批评、评比奖励模范社员、讨论秋收分配方案等；四、定期召开社员与社外群众互相交换意见的会。通过这些制度，我们社与社外群众的团结就逐渐加强了。如在第一次社员与社外群众交换意见的会上，我首先检讨了过去不主动联系社外群众的缺点；社外群众也很爽直地给社内提了三条意见，并检讨了他们自己过去讽刺社、不借东西给社的缺点。从那以后，社与社外群众的关系就变得互相关心照顾了。如有一次下大雨，社里正在开民主生活会，社外群众老杨头的瞎马掉到土豆窖里了。社员们知道后赶快跑出去，也没顾得外边下雨地上滑，弄得满身是泥，帮他把马抬出来啦。又如社员王殿臣看到社外群众宁维林的点葫芦不好使，又不好意思向社里借，就主动跑回来征求社里同意后把点葫芦拿来借给他。
    此外，我们社还注意了在每个生产季节开始先做出样子，然后组织互助组参观，通过竞赛带动互助组搞好生产。例如去年推广肇源新耕作法时，已快种麦了，但互助组还没有动弹。我们社就先按照新耕作法种一垅三苗眼，组织了全村骨干四十多人到地里去参观，介绍了小麦一垅三苗眼和早种防疸的好处。参观完了以后，郭春山组就下去两副犁、宁维林组下去四副犁种小麦，第二天全村一共下去了十九副犁杖。
    经过总路线的学习后，全村农民前进的方向更明确了，组织起来的农民占百分之九十五以上，有百分之四十二的农户入了社。从这里我们深深地认识到办好合作社做好样子，一定不要忘记把互助组和单干农民带动起来。
