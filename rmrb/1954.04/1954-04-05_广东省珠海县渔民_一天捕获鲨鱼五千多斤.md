    Fishermen in Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province
    Catch Over 5,000 Jin of Sharks in One Day
    Every spring, schools of sharks migrate and forage in the waters south of the Wanshan Islands.
    On March 18th, two fishing boats from Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province, caught over 5,900 jin of sharks in the waters 34 xun deep south of the Wanshan Islands. The largest shark weighed 340 jin.
    This batch of sharks was transported to Nanshui on March 19th. The shark fins were cut off by the fishermen and dried by themselves. The entire shark bodies were purchased by the Nanshui Supply and Marketing Station of Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Enterprise Company. The station obtained 476 jin of shark liver, which has been refrigerated and transported to the fish liver oil factory to produce fish liver oil. The shark meat has been salted, and the shark intestines have been sold to farmers as fertilizer.

    广东省珠海县渔民
    一天捕获鲨鱼五千多斤
    每年春季，万山群岛以南的海面上，都有成群结队的鲨鱼在这一带回游觅食。
    三月十八日这一天，广东省珠海县渔民的两艘渔船在万山群岛以南水深三十四浔的海面，捕获鲨鱼五千九百多斤。其中最大的一条鲨鱼有三百四十斤重。
    这批鲨鱼已在三月十九日运到南水。鲨鱼翅由渔民割回自行干制，鱼身全部由广东省水产企业公司南水供销站收购。该站取得鱼肝四百七十六斤，已用冰冷藏运往鱼肝油厂制鱼肝油；鱼肉已用盐腌制，鱼肠则卖给农民做肥料。
