Reader's Letter Summary:

    Strengthen Leadership in Mountainous Forestry Production
    Reader Li Guowei writes: In Zhangzhu District, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, the total area of agricultural cultivated land is only 65,696 mu, while there are 125,831 mu of Mao bamboo, chestnuts, pears, peaches, bamboo gardens, and mountain forests. However, the leading organs of the district have not led production according to the local characteristics. When arranging work, they only talked about agricultural activities such as ditching and draining wheat fields, hilling up roots, and accumulating fertilizer, but did not mention a word about the production work of Mao bamboo mountains, chestnut orchards, and mountain forests, which most of the masses depend on for their livelihoods. In Qiaoya Township in the district, a village has most of its land as mountain forest and only a few mu of paddy fields, but last year, several large meetings were held from top to bottom to arrange rice borer control work. Because forestry production has not received due attention and leadership, nine mountain fires occurred continuously in Chuanbu, Tongfeng, Shanquan and other townships in the district in the eight days from February 4th to 11th, burning nearly 3,000 mu of mountain forests. In Shijiuduo alone, more than 70,000 two- to three-year-old Masson pines were burned.
    The leading organs of Yixing County also do not pay enough attention to mountainous areas. For example, mutual aid and cooperation organizations are more common in plain areas, while they are rare in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. This has slowed down the economic development of mountain farmers.
    I believe that the Yixing County People's Government should strengthen its leadership in mountainous production work, and the cadres working in the mountainous areas of the county must strengthen their leadership in forestry production according to the local characteristics, so that the mountainous economy can be rapidly developed.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强对山区林业生产的领导
    读者李国伟来信：江苏省宜兴县张渚区全区农业耕地面积只有六万五千六百九十六亩，而毛竹、板栗、梨、桃、竹园和山林就有一十二万五千八百三十一亩。可是该区的领导机关没有根据当地的特点来领导生产，布置工作时只谈到麦田开沟排水、壅根培土和积肥等农事活动，对大部分群众赖以为生的毛竹山、板栗园、山林等生产工作，则只字未提。该区乔涯乡有一个村大部土地是山林，只有几亩水稻田，但是去年却曾自上而下地开了好几个大会来布置治螟工作。由于林业生产没有得到应有的重视和领导，今年二月四日至十一日的八天中，该区川埠、铜峰、善权等乡连续发生山火九次，烧毁山林近三千亩，仅石臼坞一处就烧毁二年至三年生的马尾松七万多株。
    宜兴县领导机关对山区工作也重视不够。如互助合作组织在平原地区比较普遍；在山区和半山区的就很少。这就使山区农民经济的发展进展很慢。
    我认为：宜兴县人民政府应该加强对山区生产工作的领导，该县在山区工作的干部们更必须根据当地特点，加强对林业生产的领导，这样才能使山区经济得到迅速的发展。
