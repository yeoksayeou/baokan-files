Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 28th: Joseph Starobin published an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on April 25th, saying: "China's participation in the Geneva Conference once again emphasizes that no problem can be solved without China's participation; it also shows that the alliance between China and the Soviet Union is the main lever in world affairs." The article continued: Those who want to turn back history and launch a war must consider this alliance. Those who want to end the Cold War must also consider China's attitude, strength, and interests.

He commented on the so-called Southeast Asia alliance: "This is the old method of American imperialists: using deceptive alliances as a means to control the people of various countries, control rubber, tin, tungsten, and land and naval bases... Obviously, many people will think that Dulles' strategy is a reckless adventure. The long battle at Dien Bien Phu and the equally important battles in the Hanoi-Haiphong delta show that the Vietnamese People's Army is capable of defeating the French expeditionary force, no matter how much material the latter receives, no matter how much aid the United States gives."

The article concluded, "In Geneva, there is an opportunity to consolidate the Korean armistice and end all wars in the Far East, thereby taking another step forward in stopping the Cold War worldwide. Could there be a greater contribution to our national interests and the interests of every American than this?"

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: According to TASS, Jakarta, April 27th: Indonesian newspapers welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference and hope that this conference can resolve the issues of Korea and Indochina.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial emphasizing: "In the Geneva Conference, headed by the five major powers, the People's Republic of China is participating on an equal footing with other major powers. This is the victory of sound thinking, the victory of peaceful thinking." The newspaper pointed out that the convening of the Geneva Conference "has gone through a difficult road, and there have been many obstacles on this road. The Americans have been carrying out provocations one after another until recently, attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference. The United States has expanded its intervention in Indochina; it is threatening the People's Republic of China; piecing together the Pacific aggressive bloc, and carrying out provocations in Korea." The newspaper concluded: "We must make the greatest efforts to achieve a satisfactory conclusion to the conference. The Indonesian people are eager for peace. They will support any resolution of the Geneva Conference that leads to peace. We hope that the Geneva Conference can find a way to establish lasting peace in Asia and the world."

The "Indonesian News" wrote: "The people of all Asia are uneasy about the Indochina issue. Therefore, this issue must be resolved as soon as possible at the Geneva Conference. Now is the time to end the colonial system in Indochina."

    纽约“工人日报”和印尼报纸发表评论
    希望日内瓦会议作出导致和平的决议
    【新华社柏林二十八日电】约瑟夫·斯塔罗宾四月二十五日在纽约“工人日报”上发表文章说：“中国参加日内瓦会议再一次着重说明：没有中国参加，什么问题也不能解决；也说明中国和苏联的联盟是世界事务中的主要杠杆。”文章接着说：那些想把历史倒转过来并发动战争的人，必须考虑到这个联盟。那些要想结束冷战的人，也必须把中国的态度、力量和利益考虑进去。
    他评论所谓东南亚联盟说：“这是美帝国主义者的老办法：用骗人的联盟为手段，来造成对各国人民的控制，对橡胶、锡、钨和陆、海军基地的控制……显然，许多人会认为杜勒斯的策略是轻率的冒险。在奠边府进行了很久的战斗以及在河内、海防三角洲上的同样重要的战斗说明：越南人民军是有能力击败法国远征军的，不论后者得到多少物资，不论美国给多少援助。”
    文章最后说，“在日内瓦，有巩固朝鲜停战、结束远东的一切战争的机会，从而在制止全世界范围的冷战上又前进一步。对于我们的民族利益以及每一个美国人的利益，还能有比这更大的贡献吗？”
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社雅加达二十七日讯：印尼报纸欢迎日内瓦会议的召开，希望这个会议能解决朝鲜和印度支那问题。
    印尼“人民日报”发表社论着重指出：“在以五大国为首的日内瓦会议中，中华人民共和国是和其他大国以同等地位参加的，这就是健全思想的胜利，就是和平思想的胜利。”该报指出，日内瓦会议能够召开，“是曾经走过一段艰苦的道路的，这条道路上曾存在着许多障碍。美国人直到最近还在接二连三地进行挑衅，企图达到破坏日内瓦会议的目的。美国已扩大了对印度支那的干涉；它正在威胁着中华人民共和国；拼凑太平洋侵略集团，在朝鲜进行挑衅。”该报最后写道：“必须尽最大努力以求得会议的完满结束。印尼人民是热望和平的。他们将支持日内瓦会议作出的导致和平的任何决议。我们期望，日内瓦会议能找到确立亚洲及全世界持久和平的途径。”
    “印尼新闻报”写道：“全亚洲的人民都在为印度支那问题而惴惴不安。因此，这一问题必须在日内瓦会议上尽速求得解决。现在已是结束在印度支那的殖民制度的时候了。”
