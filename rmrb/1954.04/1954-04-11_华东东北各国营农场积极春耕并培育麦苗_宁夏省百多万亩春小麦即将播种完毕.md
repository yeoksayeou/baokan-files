    State-Run Farms in East and Northeast China Actively Engage in Spring Plowing and Cultivate Wheat Seedlings
    Over One Million Mu of Spring Wheat in Ningxia Province to be Sown Soon
    State-run mechanical farms in East China are actively engaged in spring plowing, planting, and cultivating wheat seedlings. The 85,000 jin of high-quality "Dai Zi No. 15" cotton seeds at the State-Run Huaihai Farm in Jiangsu Province have been delinted, germination tested, and are prepared for sun-drying and treatment with pesticides to promote uniform germination and reduce disease. Spring barley at the State-Run Guangbei Farm in Shandong Province and spring wheat at the State-Run Dongxin Farm in Jiangsu Province have already been sown. To increase yields and reduce costs, all farms are actively accumulating natural fertilizers. The State-Run May First Farm in Shandong Province has accumulated over 1.13 million jin of fertilizer. The State-Run Huaihai Farm has accumulated enough fertilizer for over 10,000 mu of spring crops and has begun transporting it to the fields. The self-accumulated fertilizer at the State-Run Lianhu Farm in Jiangsu Province can be used as base fertilizer for two-thirds of the farm's rice paddies.
    The state-run mechanical farms have more than 60,000 mu of winter wheat, and have carried out soil cultivation, intertillage, and fertilization. At present, the wheat seedlings are tender green and growing well.
    In order to prepare for the summer harvest, the farms have begun to repair various machines. The State-Run Dongxin Farm also held a combine harvester driver training class in March, specifically explaining the performance, driving, and maintenance of combine harvesters to improve the quality of harvesting and threshing work.

    The ten mechanical farms directly under the Northeast China State-Run Farm Administration Bureau, including Gongzhuling, Fushun, Baoquanling, "93" Veterans, Yong'an, Tongbei, Hongxing, Erlongshan, Hongqi, and Sartu, are intensively sowing spring wheat. Sowing began on March 23 and is expected to be completed by April 15. In order to complete the plan of achieving an average spring wheat yield of 2,800 jin per hectare (15 mu), these ten state-run mechanical farms conducted detailed identification of wheat varieties before sowing this year, and determined thirteen high-quality wheat varieties suitable for growing in Northeast China. All seeds have undergone careful selection and disinfection, and advanced Soviet scientific methods have been adopted to improve seed germination rate and vitality. As a result, it is estimated that 410,000 jin of seeds can be saved this spring. This year, the wheat fields of each farm will also implement large-scale fertilization for the first time, which will greatly contribute to a bumper harvest of spring wheat. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Xinhua News Agency: Over one million mu of spring wheat in Ningxia Province is about to be sown. All of the spring wheat on more than 800,000 mu of irrigated land in the province has been sown, of which 75 percent is planted with the "Biyu Wheat" improved variety. "Biyu Wheat" can yield about 10 percent more than local native wheat varieties. Party and government leading organs and agricultural technology departments at all levels in Ningxia Province, in addition to allocating and promoting a large number of high-quality wheat varieties, also pay attention to promoting a series of technical improvements such as close planting with row sowing and ensuring full stands. Before sowing, various localities universally helped farmers improve and improve sowing technology by holding training classes and symposiums. During the sowing period, agricultural technicians went deep into the fields, using mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the base, to directly teach farmers advanced technologies, and focused on promoting cross-row sowing methods in areas where conditions permitted.

    华东东北各国营农场积极春耕并培育麦苗
    宁夏省百多万亩春小麦即将播种完毕
    华东区各国营机械农场正积极进行春耕春种与培育麦苗工作。江苏省国营淮海农场的八万五千斤岱字十五号优良棉种，已剥去短绒，经过发芽试验，并准备进行晒种和药剂拌种，促使发芽整齐，减少病害。山东省国营广北农场的春大麦和江苏省国营东辛农场的春小麦，已经播种完毕。为提高产量，降低成本，各场都积极增积自然肥料。山东省国营五一农场已积肥一百一十三万多斤。国营淮海农场积足一万多亩春种作物所需的肥料，并开始运送下田。江苏省国营练湖农场的自积肥料，可作全场三分之二水稻田的基肥。
    各国营机械农场共有六万多亩冬小麦，都进行了培土、中耕、施肥等工作。目前麦苗嫩绿，生长良好。
    为了迎接夏收，各场并开始检修各种机具。国营东辛农场并在三月间举办联合收割机驾驶手训练班，专门讲解联合收割机的性能、驾驶、保养等有关技术，以提高收割和脱粒工作的质量。

    东北区国营农场管理局直属的公主岭、抚顺、宝泉岭、“九三”荣军、永安、通北、红星、二龙山、红旗、萨尔图等十个机械农场，正在紧张地播种春麦。播种从三月二十三日开始，估计到四月十五日可全部结束。这十个国营机械农场，为了完成平均每垧（十五市亩）春麦产量达到二千八百斤的计划，今年在播种前详细地作了小麦品种鉴定，确定了适于东北区生长的十三种优良麦种。种籽全部经过周密的选择和消毒，又采用了苏联先进的科学方法来提高种籽发芽率和活力。因此，今春估计可节省四十一万斤种籽。各农场麦田今年还首次实行大面积施肥，这对春麦丰收将有很大作用。（新华社）

    宁夏省一百多万亩春小麦即将播种完毕。全省八十多万亩水地的春小麦已全部下种，其中百分之七十五种的是碧玉麦良种。碧玉麦约可比当地土种麦产量高出百分之十以上。宁夏省各级党政领导机关和农业技术部门，除调拨和推广大量优良麦种外，还注意推行密植条播、保证全苗等一系列的技术改进工作。播种前，各地普遍以举办训练班、召开座谈会等方式，帮助农民改进和提高播种技术。播种期间，农业技术干部深入田间，以互助合作组织为基点，向农民直接传授先进技术，并在有条件的地区重点推行了交叉条播法。  （新华社）
