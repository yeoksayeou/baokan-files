This year's Grand Ceremony was held when the coffin of Chinggis Khan, which had been taken away by the Kuomintang reactionaries for fifteen years, was moved back to its original location, Ejin Horo.

At the Grand Ceremony, Chairman Ulanhu said in his speech: "The Grand Ceremony after the return of Chinggis Khan's coffin and the groundbreaking for the new Chinggis Khan Mausoleum vividly demonstrate the meticulous care of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government for minority nationalities. The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia must unite closely with all fraternal ethnic groups across the country to jointly build our great family of the motherland." Sa Kongliao, Hu Si, and other representatives also spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously wished that the cause of ethnic unity and development in Inner Mongolia would achieve greater success on the existing foundation. Then, the Grand Ceremony was held at the Chinggis Khan sacrificial site. In front of the coffin of Chinggis Khan were filled with sacrificial offerings and tributes sent from various places and units. Chairman Ulanhu presided over the Grand Ceremony. After the sacrifice to the spirit, the conference held the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Chinggis Khan Mausoleum on the highlands of Ejin Horo. This was after the Central People's Government specially allocated huge funds to build the new Chinggis Khan Mausoleum after the coffin of Chinggis Khan was moved back from Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai Province, which made the Mongolian people very satisfied and fulfilled their long-cherished wish. Amidst the applause of the masses present, Ulanhu, Wang Zaitian, Sa Kongliao, Peng Sike, and others broke ground and erected the cornerstone commemorating the groundbreaking of the mausoleum.
