Jiangsu Xingang fishermen set sail to sea for fishing. The State Bank provides low-interest loans to fishermen to repair fishing boats and expand their capital. It also encourages fishermen to participate in cooperatives, allowing them to sell fish at fair and reasonable prices and guaranteeing sales. The People's Navy protects them from danger at sea.

To ensure the safety of fishermen, the Seamen's Union and the insurance company organized a disaster prevention team to inspect fishing boats and fishing gear before the boats went to sea.

    江苏新港渔民下海捕鱼
    江苏省新港渔民开船下海捕鱼。国家银行以低利贷款给渔民，修理渔船，扩大渔本；并吸收渔民参加合作社，使他们卖鱼得到公平合理的价格，并保证销路。人民海军部队则在海上保护他们免受危险。
    为了保证渔民的安全，在渔船下海以前海员工会和保险公司组织了防灾小组，对渔船、渔具进行了检查。
