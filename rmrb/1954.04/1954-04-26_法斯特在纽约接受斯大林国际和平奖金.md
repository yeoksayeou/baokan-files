    Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 25th: According to TASS, a ceremony was held on April 22nd at the "McAlpin" Hotel in New York to award the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to the active peace fighter and distinguished American writer Howard Fast. Those attending the award ceremony included: Kingsbury, Chairman of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association; Elizabeth Flynn, member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States; Paul Robeson, winner of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples"; Baldwin, Secretary of the National Committee of the Progressive Party; Louis Winstock, a trade union leader, as well as many other representatives of the American progressive public, trade union activists, peace movement fighters, and social activists. S.K. Tsarapkin, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, also attended to offer congratulations.
    Reverend Melish, a prominent progressive social activist in the United States, read out the decision of the Stalin International Prize Committee regarding the awarding of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples" to Fast. He said: Fast's winning the peace prize is a great honor for the American people. One of our compatriots winning the peace prize is a call to each of us to devote ourselves to the struggle for peace and a better future for humanity.
    Telegrams of congratulations to Fast from Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Prize Committee, the Soviet Peace Committee, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee and the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, and Soviet writers Tikhonov, Ehrenburg, Fadeyev, and Simonov were read out at the meeting. These telegrams aroused warm applause.
    Next, Dr. Du Bois, representing the Stalin International Prize Committee, delivered a speech. He said: Never in the entire history of mankind has there been such an urgent need for the thoughts and efforts of people of all countries to unite and fight together for peace, in order to protect mankind from the scourge of a new war. He pointed out that the Stalin International Prize Committee had originally intended to award the prize to Fast in the Kremlin in Moscow, but the U.S. State Department refused to issue him a passport to travel to the Soviet Union, thus forcing the award ceremony to be held in New York. Du Bois then described Fast's life path, his creative activities, and his tireless struggle to defend peace and the civil rights of the American people, despite the various persecutions by the U.S. government.
    After Du Bois' speech, Fast received the award amidst stormy applause. Robeson, on behalf of those present, extended warm congratulations to Fast.
    Finally, Fast delivered a reply speech, saying: I am very grateful, moved, and proud to have won the prize. He said: For centuries, mankind has dreamed of conquering disease and old age, hunger and poverty, and of turning deserts into gardens. Now we are on the eve of realizing these dreams. He emphasized: We must fight for peace, and we will be victorious in this struggle, because only by winning peace can we win everything that mankind desires.
    Fast continued: I know that here, in the United States, there are some bad people who are plotting war, preparing for war, and doing everything they can to put mankind in a state of crisis. But these bad people are opposing the very life and hope of all mankind, so not only the people of other countries, but also the people of our own country, are repeatedly saying to them: "No! We do not want war! We want to live in peace!" This is the nature of our era, and therefore the awarding of the peace prize here, in the United States, has special significance, which is to call on us to fight for peace.
    Fast concluded: We should accept this call and prove that the millions upon millions of peace-loving Americans outweigh the atomic militarists in our country. I believe that the American people will stand with the people of the world against war and for peace.

    法斯特在纽约接受斯大林国际和平奖金
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：四月二十二日，在纽约“马卡尔平”饭店举行了授予积极的和平战士、杰出的美国作家霍华德·法斯特以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的授奖仪式。参加授奖仪式的有：美苏友好协会全国理事会主席金斯伯利、美国共产党全国委员会委员伊丽莎白·弗林、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人保罗·罗伯逊、进步党全国委员会书记鲍德温、工会领袖路易斯·温斯托克以及美国进步公众的其他许多代表、工会活动家、和平运动战士和社会活动家等。苏联驻联合国副常驻代表谢·克·查拉普金也到会祝贺。
    美国著名进步社会活动家麦利希牧师在会上宣读了斯大林国际奖金委员会关于把“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授予法斯特的决定。他说：法斯特荣获和平奖金是美国人民的极大荣誉。我们的同胞之一荣获和平奖金，就是一个号召，号召我们每一个人投入为和平与人类的美好将来的斗争中。
    会上宣读了斯大林国际奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴院士、苏联拥护和平委员会、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会与苏联青年反法西斯委员会、苏联作家吉洪诺夫、爱伦堡、法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫等人致法斯特的贺电。这些贺电引起了热烈的掌声。
    接着，代表斯大林国际奖金委员会授奖的杜波依斯博士致词。他说：在整个人类历史上从来没有像现在这样急切需要各国人民的思想和努力一致起来，共同为和平而斗争，以保护人类避免新战争的灾祸。他指出，斯大林国际奖金委员会本想在莫斯科克里姆林宫授给法斯特奖金，但是美国国务院拒绝发给他去苏联的护照，因而使授奖仪式不得不改在纽约举行。杜波依斯并叙述了法斯特的生活道路、创作活动以及他不顾美国政府的种种迫害，为保卫和平、保卫美国人民的公民权利而进行的不倦的斗争。
    杜波依斯致词后，法斯特在暴风雨般的掌声中受奖。罗伯逊代表到会的人向法斯特致以热烈的祝贺。
    最后，法斯特致答词说：我的荣获奖金使我很感激、很激动，并且引为自豪。他说：多少世纪以来，人类就做着征服疾病和衰老、饥饿和贫困的梦，做着把沙漠变为花园的梦。现在我们处在实现这些梦的前夕。他强调说：我们要为和平而斗争，而且将在这个斗争中获得胜利，因为争取到和平，才能争取到人类渴望的一切。
    法斯特接着说：我知道，在这里，在美国，有些坏人策划战争准备战争，并且竭尽一切力量来使人类处于危机的状况中。但是这些坏人所对抗的是整个人类的生命和希望，因此，不仅是其他国家的人民，就是我们国家的人民也是一再地对他们说：“不！我们不要战争！我们要和平生活！”我们的时代就是这样的，因而在这里，在美国，授予和平奖金便具有特别的意义，这就是要我们为和平而斗争。
    法斯特最后说：我们应该接受这个号召，证明成千百万的爱好和平的美国人民，在我们国内比原子军国主义者的比重为大。我认为美国人民将和全世界人民一起反对战争，争取和平。
