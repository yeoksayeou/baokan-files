    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Second National Congress of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, lasting eight days, closed on April 12th. During the conference, the delegates heard reports from Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan and others on administrative, political, trade union organization, and financial work. They also heard a report from the Chairman of the Harbin District Committee on the experience of learning from and promoting the labor competition organized by the China Changchun Railway, and a report on the work experience of the Sujiatun Station Trade Union made by the Chairman of the Sujiatun Station Trade Union. The delegates discussed the above-mentioned reports, further clarifying the following three main issues:

    First, the current railway transportation capacity cannot keep up with the country's growing transportation needs. Therefore, it is necessary to fully utilize the potential of railway transportation work, carry out technical transformation in a planned and step-by-step manner, and correspondingly gradually expand the railway network.

    Second, we must gradually carry out the socialist construction of our country's railways in accordance with the advanced management system and advanced technical level of the Soviet railways, in order to improve our management level, increase transportation capacity, and fully meet the country's growing transportation needs for railways. This requires further mobilizing all railway workers to unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union and learn from and promote the experience of the China Changchun Railway.

    Third, in order to further advance the labor competition, we must unite all railway workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members, extensively carry out the technical innovation movement, organize all railway employees to participate in the labor competition, and continue to carry out the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational construction and ideological construction of the trade union, and establish a normal order of trade union work, especially the normal working order of grassroots trade unions.

    The congress elected the Second National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union and adopted resolutions on the work report of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, the resolution on organizational issues, and the resolution on the financial work report. The congress also passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, as well as telegrams of respect and letters of sympathy to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and others.

    中国铁路工会第二次全国代表大会闭幕
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会第二次全国代表大会历时八天，已在四月十二日闭幕。会议期间，大会听取了铁道部部长滕代远等关于行政、政治、工会组织和财务工作等报告，还听取了哈尔滨区委员会主席关于学习和推广中长路组织劳动竞赛的经验的报告，苏家屯车站工会主席所作的苏家屯车站工会工作经验的报告。代表们对上述许多报告都进行了讨论，进一步认清了以下三个主要的问题：
    第一、当前铁路运输能力赶不上国家日益增长的运输需要，因此，必须充分发挥铁路运输工作的潜在力量，有计划、有步骤地进行技术改造，并相应地逐步扩大铁路网。
    第二、必须按照苏联铁路的先进经营管理制度和先进技术水平，逐步地进行我国铁路的社会主义建设工作，以提高我们的经营管理水平，提高运输能力，充分满足国家对铁路日益增长的运输需要。这就必须进一步发动全路职工坚定不移地学习苏联、学习与推广中长路的经验。
    第三、要把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，必须团结全路工人、工程技术人员和职员，广泛开展技术革新运动，组织全路职工参加劳动竞赛，继续开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动。为此，必须加强工会的组织建设和思想建设，建立工会工作的正常秩序，特别是基层工会的正常工作秩序。
    大会选出了中国铁路工会第二届全国委员会，通过了关于中国铁路工会工作报告的决议、关于组织问题的决议和关于财务工作报告的决议。大会还通过了向毛主席的致敬电和向中国人民解放军等的致敬电与慰问信。
