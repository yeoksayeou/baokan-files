Xinhua News Agency: The Vietnam News Agency reported the course of the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on the French army's Cat Bi Airport on the evening of March 6th, stating:

    Cat Bi Airport is located near Hai Phong. After the United States supplied the French Air Force with B-26 aircraft in 1950, the French military authorities strengthened the airport's defensive installations. They built twenty watchtowers and five rows of barbed wire around the airbase. Inside the airport, there were also eighteen watchtowers and thirteen fortifications. Two hundred electric lights and twenty searchlights illuminated the entire airport at night. Enemy infantry, tanks, and armored vehicles patrolled day and night. Seven battalions of troops, commanded by two French colonels and fifty American "advisors," were stationed at the airport to deal with all emergency "incidents."

    In early February of this year, American interventionists sent more aircraft and pilots to Cat Bi Airport. The French military authorities adopted new defense measures and boasted that Cat Bi Airport was the safest and most heavily defended place in Indochina, and was immune to any attack.

    However, the heroic Vietnamese People's Army soldiers were determined to attack the airport as a gift to commemorate the founding of the Vietnam Labor Party.

    They crossed several enemy fortifications and secretly infiltrated near the airport. How delighted they were when they got close enough to clearly see the various types of aircraft parked in two rows on the airfield!

    Two enemy patrol vehicles drove past the team led by Comrade An, stopped in front of a fortification for two minutes, and then drove away. An enemy soldier guarded a bunker, and another soldier stood beside him, but neither of them saw the Vietnamese People's Army.

    Enemy patrols continued to come and go. Six French soldiers walked past the team led by Comrade Ying. When they were only a few steps away from the team led by Comrade An, the signal for the People's Army's attack was given. A burst of submachine gun fire felled three enemies, and the entire team surged forward, firing simultaneously. One fighter destroyed three enemy aircraft. Another fighter destroyed two aircraft. Then, explosions rumbled one after another, and smoke filled the sky above the airport. An enemy bunker tried to resist, but two bursts of machine gun fire and two hand grenades immediately silenced it.

    After an eight-minute battle, the Vietnamese People's Army troops withdrew from the airport.

    From 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM on the 7th, explosions were heard continuously, and the airport was ablaze. In this attack, a total of sixty enemy aircraft were destroyed.

    袭击法军吉碑机场的经过
    【新华社讯】　越南通讯社报道越南人民军三月六日晚上袭击法军吉碑机场的经过说：
    吉碑机场位于海防附近，一九五○年美国以B—二六型飞机供给法国空军以后，法军当局就加强了吉碑机场的防御设备。他们在这个空军基地的周围建筑了二十座了望塔、五道铁丝网；在机场里面还有十八座了望塔与十三个工事。晚上，两百盏电灯和二十个探照灯照亮着整个机场。敌人的步兵、坦克与装甲车日夜不断巡逻。由两个法军上校和五十个美国“顾问”指挥的七营军队驻在机场，以应付一切紧急“事变”。
    今年二月初，美国干涉者派遣了更多的飞机和驾驶员到吉碑机场来。法军当局采取了新的防卫措施，并吹嘘说吉碑机场是印度支那最安全和防卫最坚固的地方，是不怕任何攻击的。
    但是，英勇的越南人民军战士决心袭击这个机场，作为对越南劳动党成立纪念的献礼。
    他们越过了几个敌军工事，秘密地潜入机场附近。当他们走近到能清楚地看见分成两排停放在机场上的各式飞机的时候，他们多么高兴啊！
    敌军的两辆巡逻车开过安同志带领的一队人的身旁，在一个工事前面停了两分钟，又开走了。一个敌军士兵警卫着一个碉堡，另外一个士兵站在他旁边，但是他们都没有看到越南人民军。
    敌军巡逻兵继续来来去去。六个法军士兵从瀛同志带领的一队人的旁边走过。当他们走到离安同志带领的一队人只有几步远的时候，人民军的攻击讯号发出了。一梭冲锋枪子弹就撩倒三个敌人，全队人一拥向前，枪弹齐发。一个战士击毁了三架敌机。另一个战士炸毁了两架，接着，隆隆的爆炸声此伏彼起，机场上空烟雾弥漫。一个敌军碉堡企图顽抗，但是两梭机枪弹和两个手榴弹立刻使这个碉堡没有了声息。
    经过八分钟的战斗以后，越南人民军的部队从机场撤出。
    从七日晨一点到五点爆炸声不绝于耳，机场上一片火光。这次袭击，总共有六十架敌机被炸毁。
