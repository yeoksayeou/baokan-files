    Increasing Rural Animal Power to Improve Agricultural Production
    China to Import 10,000 Farm Horses from Mongolia
    [This newspaper dispatch] The All-China Federation of Cooperatives will import 10,000 farm horses from the Mongolian People's Republic in the second half of this year. This will play a role in increasing animal power in rural areas and further developing agricultural production in our country.
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives contacted the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government in January this year to import 10,000 farm horses. In the 1954 Sino-Mongolian Goods Exchange Agreement signed in Ulan Bator on April 7, these horses have been designated as one of the goods to be exchanged between the two countries. These imported horses are of good build and strong, and 65 percent of them are mares, some pregnant or with foals. This will not only increase animal power, but also increase the future breeding volume of draft animals.
    These imported horses are all wild horses (i.e., free-range horses) and need to be tamed and trained for a period of time before they can be put into agricultural production. Now, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has entrusted the Inner Mongolia Federation of Cooperatives, which has experience in animal husbandry, to be responsible for the operation of these horses, handling tasks such as verification and transportation, and setting up horse receiving stations in Inner Mongolia for initial training. This is the first time that the cooperative system has managed imported horses. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has decided to first allocate this first batch of imported horses to horse-deficient areas with experience in horse breeding, mainly the five provinces and four cities of western Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Harbin in the Northeast region, and a small number will be introduced to Hebei Province within the customs to gain experience in feeding and taming, etc., to create favorable conditions for continued imports of horses in the future.
    This batch of horses will be transported into the country successively before the end of September. At present, the relevant supply and marketing cooperatives are actively preparing for receiving and transporting, feeding, and organizing farmers to make reservations and purchases. It is expected that this batch of imported horses will be put into production in the spring plowing season next year.

### 增加农村畜力提高农业生产  我国将从蒙古进口一万匹耕马

    增加农村畜力提高农业生产
    我国将从蒙古进口一万匹耕马
    【本报讯】中华全国合作社联合总社今年下半年将从蒙古人民共和国进口一万匹耕马，这将对增加我国农村的畜力，进一步发展农业生产起一定作用。
    中华全国合作社联合总社于今年一月间通过中央人民政府对外贸易部与蒙古人民共和国接洽进口一万匹耕马。四月七日在乌兰巴托签订的一九五四年中蒙两国交换货物议定书中，已将此项马匹订为两国相互交换的货物之一。这批进口马匹，口青体壮，其中并有百分之六十五的母马，有的怀驹、带驹，这不但可以增加畜力，并且将增加今后耕畜的繁殖量。
    这批进口马匹都是生马（即散牧的野马），需要经过一段时间的调教训练，然后投入农业生产。现在全国合作总社已委托对畜牧有经验的内蒙古合作社联合社负责经营此项马匹，办理点验、赶运等工作，并在内蒙古设立接马站，进行初步训练。合作社系统经营进口马匹，这还是第一次。全国合作总社决定将这第一批进口马匹，首先分配给养马有经验的缺马地区，主要是东北区的辽西、黑龙江、哈尔滨等五省、四市，另以少数引入关内河北省，以吸取饲养、驯服等经验，为今后继续进口马匹创造有利条件。
    这批马匹将于九月底以前，陆续运进国内。目前各有关供销合作社正在积极进行准备接运、饲养，组织农民预约订购等工作。预计这一批进口马匹将于明年春耕季节投入生产。
