Editor's Note: Qiaomai Chuan Village in Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, was originally a backward mountain village. After the county committee, especially the district committee, strengthened specific leadership, this village quickly transformed from a backward village into an advanced village. This newspaper introduced this village on page three of the February 10th edition. After the general line was publicized, the mutual aid and cooperation work in this village has further developed. More than 96% of the farmers in the village have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the cooperative is now being gradually consolidated.

Advancing Through Constant Resolution of Contradictions
    ——An Introduction to the Political and Ideological Work of the Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative
    Zhao Xiaowu

The Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, expanded from the original 27 households to 94 households in December last year. The number of households participating in the agricultural producers' cooperative reached more than 96% of the total number of households in the village. In the past four months, because the party organization has paid attention to strengthening the socialist and collectivist education of its members, the cooperative has been gradually consolidated and developed.

The results of last year's autumn harvest of the Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative answered the question of greatest concern to everyone, namely, that agricultural producers' cooperatives can indeed produce more grain. For example, last year's output increased by 22% compared with the previous year, and the average income of each member was 3.24 shi, while the members of the best mutual aid team only earned 2.8 shi. Therefore, when the village branch proposed to expand the agricultural producers' cooperative, most farmers signed up without hesitation. A few wealthier households were hesitant. Xue Chunshan was one of them. Xue Chunshan's family had nine people, farmed sixty mu of land, and had two large castrated oxen. In a normal year, they could harvest sixteen or seventeen shi of grain. Therefore, Xue Chunshan was constantly calculating: "In terms of our situation, we have everything we need. Although we can't farm all the land, we can solve the problem by exchanging the two oxen! Joining the cooperative may or may not be beneficial. Even if it is beneficial, it's not as good as working on my own!" After the branch discovered this ideological situation, in addition to continuing to conduct in-depth education on the two roads among the masses, it also used Xue Chunshan as an example to calculate an account for everyone. Xue Chunshan's total income last year was eighteen shi of grain and thirty-six sacks of potatoes. Now that he and his nephew have separated, reducing one laborer and one large castrated ox, if he joins the agricultural producers' cooperative, his income this year will not only not decrease, but will also increase by one or two shi of grain. After thinking it over, Xue Chunshan felt that it was better to join the agricultural producers' cooperative, so he and several other wealthy households signed up to join the cooperative.

Among the new members who developed, there were several households in difficulty, so some old members had opinions. Some said, "We worked hard for a year to cultivate the land, and now adding so much bad land will bring the cooperative down!" Some said, "Close the cooperative doors!" Some said, "It's best to absorb fewer households." Xu Guozhi, the head of the cooperative, thought: It is not right not to absorb households in difficulty into the cooperative, but if we absorb households in difficulty, the old members will oppose it. What should we do? He was very anxious by himself. The branch committee held a meeting to study solutions. The branch believed that households in difficulty must be absorbed into the cooperative, and although the old members disagreed, they would agree after being persuaded and educated. Therefore, the branch organized the old members to study the experience of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Datong in absorbing households in difficulty, and at the same time mobilized everyone to discuss issues such as "Are households in difficulty a burden to the cooperative?" and "Is it right to keep households in difficulty outside the cooperative? Is it beneficial to the agricultural producers' cooperative?" In the discussion, the old members gradually realized that absorbing households in difficulty into the cooperative not only did not disadvantage everyone, but on the contrary, because there were more people in the cooperative and more strength, it could produce more grain, which would benefit everyone. As ideological problems were resolved, the Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative expanded.

But soon new problems arose:

This year, during the Spring Festival, the general merchandise team sent a variety of goods, and the members added calico, bought sneakers, flashlights... After the Spring Festival, a workers' delegation came to visit. Everyone discussed:

  "The work in our village is OK, model plus model!" Some people think this is the top of development, "Oat noodles, big potatoes, cloth shirts with leather jackets, paper windows replaced with large glass, and flowered quilts folded on the kang. What else do you want!" Many members stopped cleaning manure and chopping grass.

After discovering this, Xue Weixiang, a member of the district committee, issued a warning to the branch. Xu Guozhang, the secretary of the village branch, also realized that everyone's complacency had developed to a very serious level. Therefore, the agricultural producers' cooperative convened a general meeting of all members, and Xu Guozhang talked about the improvement of everyone's lives from the perspective of the cooperative's production problems, consciously inspiring everyone to review the work and thinking of this period. As soon as he mentioned checking the work, someone said complacently: "Not bragging, none of our village's work falls behind others!" At this time, Xu Guozhang directly said to everyone: "Our village is a model, but think about how the title of model village came about? It came from everyone's hard work in production. Besides, our village still has many shortcomings, such as the share capital of the credit cooperative has not been collected yet, and there are not many people who subscribe to the economic construction bonds. If we are proud of a little achievement, then even the original little achievement will be lost." As soon as the problem was presented, everyone's minds became clearer. Some members said, "That's right, if we are complacent with our achievements, then we will end up with nothing." After the meeting, the share capital of the credit cooperative was collected, totaling 2.75 million yuan. The economic construction bonds purchased by everyone also increased to 1.75 million yuan.

The members' arrogance was criticized to some extent, but their thinking was not thoroughly clarified. When the branch committee met to study the next step of work, Xue Weixiang, a member of the district committee, said: "To overcome the members' complacency, on the one hand, we must constantly conduct education on the general line and the socialist future, and on the other hand, we must formulate a plan for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and point out a specific goal for everyone to strive for." This suggestion was immediately supported by all members of the branch committee. After relatively thorough calculations, the branch put forward a five-year plan to all members. Within five years, in terms of agriculture: the total grain output is required to increase from 320,000 jin last year to 540,000 jin. In terms of animal husbandry: the number of large livestock is required to increase from the current 87 to 303, the number of sheep from 361 to 2,094, and the number of pigs from 20 to 218. In terms of forestry (the forestry plan is for ten years): it is required to increase the number of trees planted from 32,500 last year to 233,500 within ten years, and the area of ​​forest from 182 mu to 5,182 mu. After this plan is fully implemented, Qiaomai Chuan, this poor ditch, can be turned into a rich ditch, and barren mountains into treasure mountains. This development plan greatly encouraged the members' enthusiasm. Everyone said: This time our eyes are much brighter, and we have a specific goal to strive for. The branch launched a production competition on this ideological basis.

In the production competition, the Qiaomai Chuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative encountered new problems. Because the cooperative has expanded, the cooperative's expenses have also increased. Taking the livestock feed as an example, twenty-five pairs of livestock need to eat thirty shi of grain a year. This cannot be solved by relying on the existing funds alone. It is necessary to mobilize the members to invest and increase the funds within the cooperative.

At the members' meeting, as soon as the head of the cooperative raised the issue of livestock feed, someone said: "We have people, but we can't guarantee the feed." Some also said: "Everyone should take it together, and we can't let a few people 'take the blame'." Some also said: "Get a loan from the bank!" "Change the rented oxen to hired oxen, and let the cattle farmers feed them themselves!" But the cadres calculated:

  "If we loan 30 shi of cattle feed, we will have to pay a lot of interest. Besides, it's not reasonable to ask the government for a loan when we have our own feed." "According to custom, hiring oxen is more expensive than renting oxen. If we change rented oxen to hired oxen, it will cost 30 shi more grain in just one spring, which will reduce everyone's income." Both of these methods are not feasible. At the same time, the cattle farmers also expressed their disagreement, saying: "If we provide livestock and also provide feed, can we peel two skins from one lamb?" In this way, you waited for me, and I waited for you, and no one was willing to invest first, so the meeting came to no result.

After the meeting, the branch committee studied the reasons why the members were not actively investing and the solutions to this problem. Xu Guozhi, the head of the cooperative, said: This is because our work has not been done well. In the past, whenever we talked about the prospects of a socialist society, everyone was so happy that they jumped around, saying that they must take the socialist road. To ask everyone to invest, we must conduct socialist education for everyone. The branch committee believed that Xu Guozhi's words made sense, so it decided to conduct socialist education for the members on the one hand, and to call on the party members to take the lead in investing on the other hand. At the second members' meeting, party member Ren Guan took the lead in taking out eighteen sesame seed cakes. Then, several other party members reported several shi of black beans. As a result, some old members also followed suit and reported how much they would invest. But some people were still unwilling to invest. Member Lei Ping was one of them. He said:

  "Let the people who have feed take it out. We don't have feed." Someone immediately objected, saying:

  "No, this is everyone's business, and everyone should think of ways." Someone disagreed, saying: "Individuals are individuals, and everyone is everyone." But someone retorted, saying: "You only see that you are taking it out for everyone, but you don't see that others are taking it out for you too! Anyway, if the cooperative doesn't harvest grain, no one will get any." The debate became fierce, but more and more people stood on the right side. Xu Guozhang, the secretary of the branch, seized this opportunity to explain to everyone the principle of "everyone's cooperative, everyone's business." This made the members more clearly aware that the members are the masters of the cooperative, and only when everyone cares about the cooperative can the cooperative be run well. Otherwise, it will not be run well. In this way, you invested one shi and he invested eight dou, which not only solved the problem of cattle feed, but also solved the problem of seeds.

The agricultural producers' cooperative in Qiaomai Chuan is advancing through the continuous resolution of contradictions.

### 在不断地解决矛盾中前进——荞麦川农业生产合作社的政治思想工作介绍

    编者按：山西浑源县荞麦川村原是一个落后的山村，经县委，特别是区委加强具体领导以后，这个村很快地由落后村变成了先进村。本报在二月十日三版曾对这个村作了介绍。经过总路线宣传之后，这个村的互助合作工作又有了进一步的发展，全村已有百分之九十六以上的农户参加了农业生产合作社，现在这个社正逐步地巩固着。
    在不断地解决矛盾中前进
    ——荞麦川农业生产合作社的政治思想工作介绍
    赵孝武
    山西省浑源县荞麦川农业生产合作社，在去年十二月间，由原来的二十七户扩大到了九十四户。参加农业生产合作社的户数达到了全村总户数的百分之九十六以上。四个月来，由于党组织注意加强了对社员的社会主义和集体主义教育，所以这个社逐步得到巩固和发展。
    荞麦川农业生产合作社去年的秋收成果，回答了大家所最关心的一个问题，就是农业生产合作社的确能够增产更多的粮食。例如去年的产量就比前年增加了百分之二十二，每个社员平均收入三石二斗四升，最好的互助组的组员收入才不过两石八斗。因此，当村支部提出扩大农业生产合作社时，一般农民都二话没说地报了名。少数富裕户是犹豫不定的。薛纯山就是其中的一个。薛纯山全家九口人，种地六十亩，有两头大犍牛，一般年景可以收十六、七石粮食。因此薛纯山成天盘算着：“论咱的光景要啥有啥，虽说地多种不过来，只要拿两头牛一拨换就解决问题啦！入了社还说不定有没有利，就是有利，也不如自己干起来有奔头呀！”支部发现这种思想情况后，除了在群众中继续深入地进行了两条道路的教育外，又以薛纯山为例，给大家算了一笔账。薛纯山去年总收入粮食十八石，山药蛋三十六口袋。现在他和侄儿分了家，减少了一个劳动力和一头大犍牛，但是，他如果参加农业生产合作社后，今年的收入不仅不会减少，还会增加一两石粮食。薛纯山思量了一番，觉得还是参加农业生产合作社好，他就和其他几户富裕户一同报名入了社。
    在发展的新社员中，有几户是困难户，因此某些老社员有了意见。有的说：“咱们辛苦一年刚把土地作务好，现在增加这么多不好的地，这会把社累垮的！”有的说：“把社门关起来吧！”有的说：“最好是少吸收几户。”社长徐国治想：不吸收困难户入社是不对的，要是吸收困难户，老社员又反对，这怎么办呢？他一个人很着急。支委会就开会研究解决的办法。支部认为困难户一定要吸收入社，老社员虽不同意，对他们进行说服教育工作之后，也会同意的。因此，支部就组织老社员学习了大同陈家庄农业生产合作社吸收困难户的经验，同时发动大家讨论了“困难户入社是不是累赘”、“把困难户留在社外对不对，对农业生产合作社有没有利”等问题。在讨论中，老社员逐步认识到：吸收困难户入社，不但大家不吃亏，相反的，因为社内人多力量大，能够增产更多的粮食，大家都有利。随着思想问题的解决，荞麦川农业生产合作社就扩大了。
    但是不久又发生了新的问题：
    今年过春节的时候，百货小组送来了各种各样的货物，社员们添花布，买球鞋、手电筒……。春节过后，工人代表团又来访问。大家纷纷议论着：
  “咱们村的工作可行啦，模范加模范！”有人认为这算是发展到顶啦，“莜面，大山药，布衫子套皮袄，纸窗子换上了大玻璃，炕上也叠起了花被子。还想啥哩！”许多社员粪也不掏了，草也不切了。
    区委委员薛维祥发觉后就对支部提出了警告。村支部书记徐国璋也觉察到大家的自满情绪已经发展到非常严重的地步。于是，农业生产合作社召集全体社员大会，徐国璋就从大家的生活的改善谈到社里的生产问题，有意识地启发大家来检查这一段的工作和思想。他刚提到检查工作，就有人自满地说：“不是吹，咱们村的工作哪一件落在人后边！”这时徐国璋就直接了当地对大家说：“咱们村是模范，但是大家想想模范村的称号是怎样得来的？是靠大家努力生产得来的。再说，咱村还有不少缺点，比如信用合作社的股金到现在还没有集起来，认购经济建设公债的人还不多。如果有了一点成绩，就骄傲了，那末连原来的一点成绩也会丢掉的。问题一摆出来，大家的头脑比较清醒了。社员中有人说：“对着哩，有了成绩就自满，那么就非落个‘净光’不可。”会后，信用合作社的股金就集起来了，共有二百七十五万元。大家购买的经济建设公债也增加到一百七十五万元。
    社员的骄气是受到了一些批评，但是思想并没有彻底弄通。在支部委员会开会研究下一步工作的时候，区委委员薛维祥说：“要克服社员的这种骄傲自满情绪，一方面要经常进行总路线教育，社会主义前途教育，另一方面要制订出一个农林牧发展计划，给大家指出一个具体的奋斗目标。”这个意见，立即得到全体支部委员的拥护。经过比较周密的计算后，支部向全体社员提出了一个五年计划。在五年之内，在农业方面：要求粮食总产量由去年的三十二万斤提高到五十四万斤。畜牧业方面：要求大牲畜由现在的八十七头增加到三百零三头，羊由三百六十一只增加到两千零九十四只，猪由二十口增到二百一十八口。林业方面（林业计划是十年）：要求在十年内植树由去年的三万二千五百株增到二十三万三千五百株，成片林由一百八十二亩增到五千一百八十二亩。这个计划完全实现后，就可以使荞麦川这个穷沟变成富沟，荒山变成宝山。这个发展计划对社员的情绪鼓舞很大。大家都说：这回眼睛亮得多了，有了具体的奋斗目标。支部就在这一思想基础上，发动大家开展了生产竞赛。
    在生产竞赛中，荞麦川农业生产合作社又遇到了新的问题。因为社扩大了，社的开支也增多了。以牲口的饲料来说，二十五犋牲口一年就得吃三十石粮食。这仅靠现有的一点资金是不能解决问题的，必须发动社员投资，增加社内的资金。
    在社员大会上，社长刚提出牲口饲料问题，就有人说：“要人有一个，料可管不了。”又有人说：“要拿大家一齐拿，不能单让几个人‘垫背’。”也有人说：“到银行贷款！”“租牛犋改成雇用牛犋，让养牛户自己喂养吧！”可是干部一合计：
  “贷三十石牛料的款，得出很多的利息。再说自己有料，再向政府贷款也不像话。”“按习惯，雇牛犋比租牛犋价格较高，如将租牛犋改成雇牛犋，只一个春季就得多费三十石粮食，这就会减少大家的收入。”这两个办法都行不通。同时养牛户也表示不同意，他们说：“出上牲口，再贴上料，一个羊羔还能剥两张皮？”就这样，你等我，我等你，谁也不肯先投资，会议就没个结果。
    会后，支部委员会研究社员不积极投资的原因和解决这个问题的办法。社长徐国治说：这怨咱们的工作没做到。过去每讲到社会主义社会的远景，大家都高兴得乱跳，说一定要走社会主义的道路。要大家投资就得对大家进行社会主义教育。支部委员会认为徐国治的话有道理，就决定一方面向社员进行社会主义教育，一方面号召党员带头投资。在第二次社员大会上，党员任官首先带头拿出十八片麻饼，接着，又有几个党员报出几石黑豆，于是有些老社员们也都跟着自报投资多少；但也有些人仍旧不愿投资。社员雷平就是其中的一个。他说：
  “有料的人们拿吧，咱没有料。”有人立即反对说：
  “不对，这是大家的事情，应当大家想办法。”有人不同意说：“个人是个人，大家是大家。”但是又有人反驳说：“你只看见你拿出来为了大家，你可没看见别人拿出来也是为了你呀！反正社里打不下粮食谁也分不到。”争论激烈起来，但是站到正确方面的人越来越多。支部书记徐国璋便抓住这个时机向大家讲了“大家的社，大家来办”的道理。这就使社员更加明确认识到：社员就是社的主人，大家都关心社，社才能办好。否则，是办不好的。这样，你一石他八斗的都投资了，这不但解决了牛料问题，连种籽问题也解决了。
              ×××
    荞麦川的农业生产合作社，就在不断地解决矛盾中前进着。
