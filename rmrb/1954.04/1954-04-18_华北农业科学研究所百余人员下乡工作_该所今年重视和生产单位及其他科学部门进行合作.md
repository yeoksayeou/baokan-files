The scientific research personnel of the North China Agricultural Science Institute are paying special attention this year to conducting investigations and research in conjunction with actual production, and are actively cooperating with scientific personnel from various departments.

The North China Agricultural Science Institute recently dispatched more than one hundred scientific and technical personnel to dozens of state-owned farms, collective farms, production cooperatives, and local agricultural leading organs in Hebei, Shanxi, and the suburbs of Beijing to cooperate, help improve agricultural production technology, and conduct investigations and research work. A group of animal husbandry and veterinary personnel will also depart for various locations within days. The peanut rhizobium inoculant, which has been proven by the institute to greatly increase peanut production, will be promoted and tested on millions of acres of land in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and the suburbs of Beijing during the spring sowing this year. The institute's method of making fertilizer by layering weeds, corn stalks, and human and animal manure, and watering it extensively - the aerated high-temperature rapid composting method - is simple and easy to implement, and can double the fertilizer efficiency. According to the person in charge of the institute, this method can greatly increase fertilizer production and solve part of the fertilizer shortage problem. This composting method has now been demonstrated and promoted in dozens of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Hebei and Shanxi, and the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Shanxi has already used it extensively. This year, the personnel of the institute going to the countryside will focus on studying the regionalization of crop varieties and cultivation methods, in order to gradually help farmers improve crop varieties and cultivation methods. This year, the institute has also begun to trial-produce rhizobium inoculants for crops such as soybeans, peas, and broad beans, and will promote them on a large scale after the institute trials them.

This year, the North China Agricultural Science Institute has signed cooperation agreements with the Academy of Sciences and the Agricultural University. The institute's personnel going to the countryside will provide the researchers and professors of the Academy of Sciences and the Agricultural University with research materials to enrich the content of scientific research; the institute's research work will also be supported by the researchers of the Academy of Sciences and the Agricultural University. According to the person in charge of the institute, after the scientific personnel go to the countryside and come into contact with reality, they all feel the farmers' urgent need for science and technology, and feel that the strength of scientific and technical personnel is insufficient. Therefore, the habit of mutual non-communication among agricultural scientific and technical personnel has changed, and the atmosphere of unity and research has gradually become stronger.

    华北农业科学研究所百余人员下乡工作
    该所今年重视和生产单位及其他科学部门进行合作
    华北农业科学研究所的科学研究人员，今年特别重视结合生产实际进行调查研究的工作，并积极和各部门的科学人员实行合作。
    华北农业科学研究所最近派出了一百多个科学技术人员，到河北、山西及北京郊区的数十个国营农场，集体农庄，生产合作社和当地农业领导机关合作，帮助改进农业生产技术，进行调查研究工作。一批畜牧兽医人员，日内也将出发到各地工作。该所经过试验，证明能够使花生大量增产的花生根瘤菌拌种剂，今年春季播种中，将在山东、河南、河北、江苏北部和北京郊区成百万亩的土地面积上推广试用。该所试验用杂草、玉米秆和人粪、牲畜粪层层堆积，并大量浇水制肥的方法——通气高温速效堆肥法，方法简单易行，又能提高肥效一倍。据该所负责人谈，用这种方法可以大量增加肥料，解决一部分肥料不足的问题，现在这一堆肥法已经在河北、山西数十个互助合作组织中示范推广，山西中苏友好集体农庄并已大量施用。该所下乡人员今年将着重研究作物品种和栽培方法的区域化，以逐渐帮助农民改进作物品种和栽培方法；该所今年并已开始试制大豆、豌豆、?豆等作物的根瘤菌拌种剂，待该所试用后，也将大量推广。
    华北农业科学研究所今年和科学院、农业大学签订了合作协议书，该所下乡人员将供给科学院、农业大学的研究人员和教授以研究材料，充实科学研究内容；该所研究工作也将可得到科学院和农业大学研究人员的支持。据该所负责人谈，科学人员下乡接触实际以后，都感觉到农民对科学技术的迫切需要，感觉到科学技术人员的力量不足，所以农业科学技术人员之间互不通气的习惯改变了，团结起来进行研究的空气已逐渐浓厚起来。
