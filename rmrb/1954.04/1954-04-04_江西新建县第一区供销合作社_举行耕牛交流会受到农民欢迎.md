Jiangxi Xinjian County First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Holds Cattle Exchange Meeting, Welcomed by Farmers

    With the development of agricultural production and the unfolding of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many farmers in the First District of Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province, are requesting to increase animal power. In the past, local farmers had to spend a lot of time and money to buy and sell cattle in the cattle markets of Nanchang and other places, and they were also subject to deception and exploitation by cattle dealers. In order to help farmers solve these difficulties, the First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Xinjian County held a cattle exchange meeting in mid-March to organize farmers in the district who wanted to sell and buy cattle to regulate animal power. Farmers can voluntarily adjust their cattle at the exchange meeting, and the cooperative organizes introductions. Not only does it not charge fees, but it also assists both parties in fair pricing, so that neither party suffers. In just three days, local farmers exchanged a total of forty-eight cattle, enabling appropriate regulation of animal power for farmers. According to the needs of farmers, this supply and marketing cooperative has decided to continue holding regular cattle exchange meetings in the near future, and is preparing to send farmer representatives familiar with cattle conditions to other places to purchase strong cattle to meet the needs of farmers.

    江西新建县第一区供销合作社
    举行耕牛交流会受到农民欢迎
    随着农业生产的发展和互助合作运动的开展，江西省新建县第一区许多农民要求增加畜力。过去当地农民到南昌等地的牛行买牛和卖牛，要花许多时间和盘费，还受牛贩子的欺骗和剥削。新建县第一区供销合作社为了帮助农民解决这些困难，在三月中旬举行了耕牛交流会，组织全区要卖牛和买牛的农民调剂畜力。农民在交流会上可以自愿地调剂耕牛，合作社从中组织介绍，不但不收取费用，还协助双方公平议价，使双方都不吃亏。仅三天工夫，当地农民共交流了四十八头耕牛，使农民的畜力得到了适当的调剂。这个供销合作社根据农民的要求，决定在最近期间继续定期举行耕牛交流会，并准备推派熟悉耕牛情况的农民代表到外地采购壮牛，供应农民需要。（毛礼锌）
