The Jiaxing Special District in Zhejiang Province has fertile soil and a mild climate and was originally a pure late-season japonica rice area. In the past, in order to solve the need for food during the summer scarcity and funds for topdressing fertilizer at the end of the late-season japonica rice growing period, the masses gradually expanded the area of early and mid-season rice. Currently, early and mid-season rice accounts for more than two million mu of the district's more than five million mu of rice fields. Because early and mid-season rice have a short growing period, and are often hit by typhoons during the flowering and grain-filling period, they are prone to lodging and have low yields. In 1953, the average late-season japonica rice in the district yielded about 88 jin per mu more than early and mid-season rice. Based on this situation, after the autumn harvest last year, various places mobilized the masses to calculate production increase accounts and find key points for increasing production. Through investigation, research, and discussions, everyone unanimously believed that: changing early and mid-season rice to late-season rice not only results in high yields and good quality, but also allows ample time to raise silkworms well and further develop sideline production. As for the problem of summer scarcity food and late-stage topdressing fertilizer for late-season japonica rice, due to consecutive years of bumper harvests, there are generally ways to solve it. Therefore, farmers were universally called upon to change early and mid-season rice fields to late-season rice. According to incomplete statistics, the area converted to late-season japonica rice in the district has now reached more than 391,000 mu, accounting for 20 percent of the total area of early and mid-season rice. Calculated at an increase of 80 jin per mu, this year can increase production by more than 31 million jin.

    嘉兴专区将早中稻田改种晚粳增加产量
    浙江省嘉兴专区土质肥沃，气候温和，原为一纯晚粳稻区。过去群众为解决夏荒口粮及晚粳末期追肥用款的需要，逐渐扩大早、中稻面积，现全区五百多万亩稻田中，早、中稻面积已占二百多万亩。由于早、中稻生长期短，开花灌浆期间又经常遭受台风侵袭，因此易于倒伏，产量较低。一九五三年全区平均晚粳稻比早、中稻每亩要多收八十八斤左右。根据这一情况，去年秋收后，各地即发动群众算增产账、找增产关键，通过调查研究与座谈讨论，大家一致认为：早、中稻改种晚稻，除产量高、质量好而外，还可抽出充裕的时间养好蚕，进一步发展副业生产。至于夏荒口粮和晚粳末期追肥问题，由于连年丰收，一般都已有办法解决。因此，便普遍号召农民将早、中稻田改种晚稻。全区现据不完全统计，改种晚粳面积已达三十九万一千多亩，占全部早、中稻面积的百分之二十。以每亩增产八十斤计，今年可增产三千一百万多斤。
