    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: According to TASS, the British House of Commons held a debate on April 5th regarding the Labor Party's proposal on reducing and controlling armaments. This issue was raised because of the United States' hydrogen bomb tests on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. After the debate, a motion proposed by the Labor Party was passed without a vote: it requested the government to seek a summit meeting of the leaders of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and to reach an agreement on the issue of reducing and controlling armaments.
    The debate in the British House of Commons shows that the British public is increasingly uneasy about the adventurous policies of the United States, which harm Britain's vital interests. They are eager to reach an international agreement on banning the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, which cause mass slaughter of humanity, thereby further easing the current international situation. According to reports, when the House of Commons held its debate on the 5th, the area outside Parliament was crowded with people who were very concerned and wanted to know the outcome of the debate.
    "Pravda's" London correspondent, F. Orekhov, commented on the House of Commons debate, pointing out that the parliamentary debate reflects, to a certain extent, the increasingly profound desire of the British people to immediately resolve the issue of disarmament and banning the use of atomic weapons.

    英下院就裁军问题通过决议
    要求英、苏、美首脑举行会谈
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社讯：英国下院在四月五日就工党所提出的关于裁减并管制军备的问题举行了辩论，这个问题是由于美国在太平洋上比基尼岛进行氢弹试验而提出来的。辩论结束后，未经投票就通过工党所提出的一项建议：要求政府设法举行英、苏、美三国首脑会谈并就裁减和管制军备问题达成协议。
    英国下院的辩论表明，英国公众对于危害英国切身利益的美国冒险政策日益感到不安，他们热切希望在禁止使用大规模屠杀人类的原子武器及氢武器的问题上达成国际协议，从而使目前的国际局势得到进一步的缓和。据消息说，就在五日下院进行辩论时，议会门外拥满了群众，他们非常关心并且希望知道辩论的结果。
    “真理报”驻伦敦记者弗·奥列霍夫在评论下院辩论时指出：议会的辩论在一定程度上反映了英国人民的日益深切的愿望，他们希望立即解决裁减军备和禁止使用原子武器的问题。
