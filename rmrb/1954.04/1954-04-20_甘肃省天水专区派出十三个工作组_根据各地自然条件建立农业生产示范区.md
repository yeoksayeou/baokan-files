Gansu Province's Tianshui Prefecture has a cultivated land area that is 90% mountainous, with significant variations in natural conditions across different regions. To further improve agricultural production and implement the development policy of integrating agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, Tianshui Prefecture, based on the geographical environment, distribution of crops, the foundation for afforestation, and differences in water conservancy and irrigation conditions, selected thirteen representative townships as key areas for the prefecture to guide agricultural production in various types of regions. Recently, the Commissioner's Office has dispatched thirteen work teams to these townships to summarize local major crop cultivation techniques and systematic experiences in increasing yields, and to establish typical demonstration zones. For example, Lüergou in Tianshui County is a large gully severely eroded, with the highest point of the watershed at about 1,700 meters above sea level, and a water catchment area of about ten square kilometers. The work team stationed in this key area will focus on studying and summarizing the laws of erosion in the gully catchment area, collecting data on gully management, providing a reliable basis for future pilot water storage projects, and creating experiences in direct seeding afforestation on barren hills, forest nurseries, protecting grasslands, improving grass seeds, and planting fruit trees on mountains. Currently, all work teams have begun their work. The Beishan work team in Longxi County, in conjunction with spring plowing and production, publicized and promoted green manure crops, with Zhangjiacha Village alone promoting more than 10,500 mu. The work team in Qin'an County, taking advantage of the county's convening of a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and labor model representatives, conducted technical training on water and soil conservation. Most of the more than 300 representatives attending the meeting incorporated tasks such as building field ridges, terracing, digging涝池 [lao chi, ponds to collect water and fertilizer], and afforestation into their production increase plans.

    甘肃省天水专区派出十三个工作组
    根据各地自然条件建立农业生产示范区
    甘肃省天水专区百分之九十的耕地面积是山地，各地自然条件相差很大。为了进一步提高农业生产，贯彻农、林、牧相结合的发展方针，天水专区根据各地地理环境，农作物的分布情况，植树造林基础及水利灌溉条件的差异，选择了十三个有代表性的乡，作为专区指导各类地区农业生产的重点。最近专署已派出十三个工作组到了各乡，总结当地主要粮食栽培技术和提高产量的系统经验，建立典型示范区。例如天水县吕二沟是冲刷严重的大型山沟，分水岭最高处拔海一千七百公尺左右，积水面积约十余平方公里。住在这个重点的工作组，就着重研究总结沟壑集流区的冲刷规律；搜集治理沟壑的资料；为将来试办较大的蓄水工程提供可靠的根据；创造荒山直播造林、林间苗圃、保护草坡、改良草种和果树上山等经验。目前各工作组已开始工作。陇西县北山工作组，结合春耕生产，宣传和推广了草木稚，仅张家岔一村，就推广了一万零五百多亩。秦安县的工作组，利用县里召开互助组长及劳动模范代表会议的机会，进行了水土保持的技术传授，到会的三百多名代表，大部都把培地埂、修梯田、挖涝池、造林等订入了自己的增产计划。
