Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: U.S. economic activity continued to decline in March. Normally, March should be a "boom month" of the year, and some people in the U.S. ruling clique had even predicted "hopes" for an improvement in the economic situation in March, but facts have proved that these "hopes" have been shattered.

Taking the U.S. industrial production situation in March as an example, the production of some basic industries continued to decline, with the decline in steel production being the most serious. According to estimates by the American Iron and Steel Institute, in the week ending March 27, the steel industry's operating rate will drop to 66.5 percent, a decrease of 36.6 percent compared with the same period last year. This decline represents the lowest weekly steel production operating rate in four years. The production situation of durable goods manufacturing is equally serious. According to reports from U.S. statistical agencies, the production of the most important automobile industry in the two consecutive weeks ending March 27 decreased by 14 percent compared with the same period in 1953. Among them, the production of smaller automobile companies this year decreased by 63 percent compared with the same period last year in the period up to the beginning of March. It is worth noting that although automobile production has been greatly reduced, inventory levels are still increasing. By the end of March, the accumulated number of new cars had reached 650,000.

U.S. domestic trade sales are also declining. According to figures from Dun & Bradstreet, U.S. retail trade in the week ending March 17 decreased by 4 percent compared with the same period last year. The decline in trade volume is causing the number of store closures to increase day by day. In the three consecutive weeks starting from March 4, the number of U.S. store closures was 223, 229, and 243 respectively, an increase of 52 percent compared with the number of store closures in the same period last year.

Due to the stagnation of production activities and commodity circulation, the volume of freight carried by U.S. railroads has also declined. In the week ending March 27, the volume of freight carried by railroads was 13 percent lower than in the same period last year.

The situation is the same in terms of heavy industry, durable goods manufacturing, trade sales, and freight volume. The greatly reduced figures on which the U.S. government bases its estimates of business activity also show ominous signs. For example, a survey of 2,500 companies nationwide conducted by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission from the end of February to the beginning of March showed that U.S. industrial construction investment this year, which has a significant direct impact on employment and industrial production, will decrease by 4 percent compared with last year. At the same time, according to estimates by U.S. government experts, the average personal income in the first three months of this year will be 2.2 percent lower than in July of last year.

Faced with the growing signs of economic crisis, "Business Week" on March 22 could not help but draw the following conclusion when looking at the U.S. economic prospects: it is "difficult to see any hope of a sharp rebound" in the U.S. industrial and commercial situation. The magazine pointed out that the signs of economic recession in the United States: the decline in investment and the increase in unemployment indicate that this decline "can no longer be entirely explained by the efforts of industrialists and businessmen to reduce inventories." The American metal manufacturing weekly "Iron Age" also said that steel producers "completely do not believe that the improvement they expect will come in April."

### 美国工业生产和贸易销售额仍在继续下降  美国垄断资本的报刊承认美国的经济前景黯淡

    美国工业生产和贸易销售额仍在继续下降
    美国垄断资本的报刊承认美国的经济前景黯淡
   【新华社四日讯】美国经济三月份继续下降。照平常情况，三月应该是一年中的“旺月”，而美国统治集团中某些人士也曾预计三月份的经济情况有好转的“希望”，可是事实证明这种“希望”已经破灭了。
    以三月份的美国工业生产情况来说，一些基本工业的生产都继续在下降，而钢铁生产的下降最为严重。据美国钢铁研究所估计，到三月二十七日为止的一周内，钢铁工业的开工率将下降到百分之六十六点五，与去年同期比较，下降达百分之三十六点六，这种下降达到四年来最低的一周钢铁生产开工率的纪录。耐用品制造业的生产情形同样严重。根据美国的统计机构的报告，占最重要地位的汽车工业在到三月二十七日为止的连续两周的生产，与一九五三年同期比较减少了百分之十四。其中今年较小的汽车公司的生产在到三月上旬为止的时期内，比去年同期减少了百分之六十三。值得注意的是，虽然汽车的生产已大大减少，但存货数量仍然增加。到三月底为止，新车积存已达六十五万辆。
    美国国内贸易销售额也在下降。根据邓—布列德斯特里统计所的数字，到三月十七日为止的一周内，美国的零售贸易比去年同期降低百分之四。贸易额的下降，使商店倒闭的数字一天一天地在增加。自三月四日起的连续三周内，美国商店倒闭的数字各为二百二十三、二百二十九、二百四十三家。比去年同期的商店倒闭数字增加了百分之五十二。
    由于生产活动与商品流通的停滞，美国铁路的载运量也随之下降，到三月二十七日为止的一周内，铁路的载运量要比去年同期下降百分之十三。
    就重工业、耐用品制造业、贸易销售与载运量的情形来看是如此，就美国政府估计企业活动情况时所根据的几个重要因素中所大大缩小了的数字看来，也显出恶兆。例如，商务部和证券交易委员会二月底到三月初对全国两千五百个公司的调查估计表明，对就业和工业生产有重大直接影响的今年美国工业建设投资，将比去年减少百分之四。同时，据美国政府专家们的估计，在今年的头三个月的平均个人收入，要比去年七月减少百分之二点二。
    面对着经济危机的征象的日益发展，三月二十二日的“商业周刊”在瞻望美国的经济前景时不得不得出这样的结论，就是：美国工商业情况“很难看出有任何猛烈回升的希望”。该刊指出，美国经济衰退迹象中的迹象：投资额在下泻，失业人数在增加，说明这种减退的现象“再不能完全用工商业者努力减少存货来解释了”。美国金属制造业周刊“钢铁时代”也说，钢铁业生产者“完全不相信他们所期待的好转会在四月间到来”。
