The members of well-known agricultural production cooperatives and collective farm members in various regions are enthusiastically launching spring plowing production competitions to greet the "May Day" holiday with new labor achievements.

Agricultural production cooperatives led by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Shanxi Province, Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Wu Chun'an, Wu Houl, Qu Yaoli, and others, as well as the Yinma River Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiutai County, Jilin Province, the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner, Inner Mongolia, and the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Minhou County, Fujian Province, are all working hard to complete the sowing plans on time and to create greater achievements in the sowing competition to welcome International Labor Day on "May Day." The Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm recently convened a meeting of representatives of the farm members, mobilizing to plant corn. Representatives of the nine production teams launched a competition at the meeting, guaranteeing that over 14,000 mu of crops would have full stands of seedlings as a gift for "May Day." The Changzhi Tractor Station decided to complete the task of plowing before "May Day" to support the farm's planting. To welcome "May Day," the Li Shunda Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative decided to further push the red flag competition to a climax: in addition to carrying out sowing on time and ensuring full stands of seedlings, they will change the old habit of planting with the plow and will do all planting of corn by digging holes, applying fertilizer, and spot-sowing, and use large-ridge drills to sow millet. To ensure full and strong seedlings for the cotton planted by the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative this year, and to ensure that all cotton emerges from the soil before "May Day", after the rain on April 16, 176 mu of dryland cotton were planted in one day on April 17, and the remaining well-irrigated cotton was also planted successively. Members of the Yinma River Agricultural Production Cooperative guaranteed to complete all planting plans for corn, millet, and sorghum before "May Day."

    李顺达、韩恩等农业生产合作社
    开展春耕生产竞赛迎接“五一”
    各地著名的农业生产合作社的社员和集体农庄的庄员们热烈展开春耕生产竞赛，以新的劳动成果迎接“五一”节。
    山西省中苏友好集体农庄、李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安、武侯梨、曲耀离等所领导的农业生产合作社，以及吉林省九台县饮马河农业生产合作社、内蒙古科尔沁左翼中旗前进农业生产合作社、福建闽侯县红光农业生产合作社等，都正在以紧张的劳动，争取按时完成播种计划，并在播种竞赛中创造更大的成就，来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。中苏友好集体农庄在最近召开了庄员代表大会，动员播种玉米。九个生产队的代表在会上展开了竞赛，保证一万四千多亩农作物全苗，作为向“五一”节的献礼。长治拖拉机站决定在“五一”节以前，完成耕地任务，支持农庄播种。李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社为迎接“五一”节，决定把红旗竞赛进一步推向高潮：除按时进行播种，保证全苗外，并改变随犁下种的旧习惯，全部做到刨窝坐肥点种玉米，用大垄耧播种谷子。吴春安农业生产合作社今年种的棉花，为保证苗全苗旺、在“五一”节前全部出土，四月十六日下雨后，十七日一天就种完了一百七十六亩旱地棉花，其余井浇地棉花也陆续种完。饮马河农业生产合作社社员保证在“五一”以前全部完成玉米、谷子和高粱等播种计划。
