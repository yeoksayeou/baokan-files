Xinhua News Agency, Benxi: The recovery and reconstruction project of the Cai Tun vertical shaft of the Benxi Mining Bureau is accelerating and is expected to be handed over for production in October this year. After the vertical shaft is completed, it will produce a large amount of high-quality coking coal for the needs of the steel industry.

During the puppet Manchukuo period, this vertical shaft project had excavated a main shaft, a secondary shaft, and part of the underground roadway. After liberation, the People's Government quickly restored it and officially started construction in 1951. By the end of last year, the main underground transport road, the underground pump room, and the underground tunneling and other projects had been largely completed. The secondary shaft excavation has been completed. On the ground, in addition to completing the construction of the air compressor building, three Soviet-style air compressors have been installed.

This year, the construction scale of the Cai Tun vertical shaft is very large. The roadways excavated along the coal seam are equivalent to three times the total underground excavation in 1953. The total amount of electromechanical installation work is ten times larger than last year. This includes the installation of a huge fan, the renovation of a large coal washing plant, the construction of a substation, the erection of underground transmission lines, and the continued laying of underground railways. In order to complete this year's construction plan and ensure the handover to production on schedule, the workers recently, in discussions of the national plan, have set out to achieve the goal of completing their tasks ahead of schedule. The workers installing the fan are preparing to complete two months of installation work in one month. The second shift of the fourth team of the masonry and turning team proposed that the four-month excavation plan should be completed in forty days. As of March 20th, the masonry, excavation and other projects have overfulfilled the March plan. After studying Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method and implementing division of labor and assembly line operations, the twelfth team of the rock workshop reversed the previous situation where it could not complete the shed construction plan. Now the progress of shed construction has reached a maximum of four meters, which is nearly doubled compared to the planned progress.

### 本溪彩屯竖井恢复改建工程正在加速进行

    本溪彩屯竖井恢复改建工程正在加速进行
    【新华社本溪讯】　本溪矿务局彩屯竖井的恢复改建工程正在加速进行，预计今年十月就可移交生产。这座竖井建成后，将生产大量的优质炼焦煤，供给钢铁工业需用。
    这座竖井工程在伪满时期曾开掘过一个主井井筒，副井井筒和井下巷道工程也开掘了一部分。解放后，人民政府就迅速加以恢复，并在一九五一年正式开始建设，到去年年底止，井下主要运输道、地下水泵房、井下掘进等工程已完成了很大部分，副井的掘井工程已经完成，地面上除完成了空气压缩机的建筑外，并安装好了三台苏式的空气压缩机。
    今年，彩屯竖井的建设规模很大。沿煤层开凿的巷道相当于一九五三年坑下各掘进总和的三倍。机电安装工程总量比去年大十倍。其中包括安装一台巨大的扇风机，改建大型洗煤厂，建设一座变电所，架设井下输电线路和继续铺设井下铁道等。职工们为完成今年的建井计划，保证按期移交生产，最近在讨论国家计划中，都纷纷订出提前完成任务的奋斗目标。安装扇风机的工人准备以一个月时间争取完成两个月安装任务，砌镟队开帮四组二班工人提出四个月开帮计划要在四十天内完成。到三月二十日止，砌镟、开帮等工程已超额完成了三月份计划。岩石车间十二组学习了崔国山快速掘进法，实行分工种流水作业后，扭转了过去不能完成架棚子计划的局面，现在架棚子进度最高达到四公尺，比计划进度提高了将近一倍。
