Fascist Shadows Envelop America

    The Most Hilarious "Comedy"
    The British "Daily Mail" published a commentary in February of this year titled "Laugh or Cry?", mocking America's anti-communist hysteria. The article wrote: Not long ago, American censorship authorities deleted many sections from the comedy of Aristophanes, the famous Greek playwright and master of satire; insisting that the play he wrote about two thousand four hundred years ago possessed "communist ideas."
    A section of poetry deleted from Aristophanes' comedy was:
    "Let me explain the truth,
    All people should be equal,
    Sharing all joys and wealth;
    Never allowing one to be rich while others are poor."
    The director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts stated frankly: His students refused to play roles in Aristophanes' comedy because they were afraid the authorities would say they were "Reds."
    The article wrote: "If you hear earth-shattering laughter, you will know it is the gods on Mount Olympus [note] laughing. Aristophanes himself is laughing heartily at this most hilarious comedy that has never been seen since his time."

    Terror of "Red"
    According to a TASS New York dispatch on February 17: A jury in the United States Federal Court sentenced six Communist leaders in Michigan on the "crime" of violating the so-called Smith Act. One of the defendants, Jent, was forced to appear in court on a stretcher, even though she was seriously ill. Before the sentencing, a small disturbance occurred in the courtroom.
    Let's look at how the American newspapers describe this small disturbance! When the stretcher carrying Jent entered the courtroom, Federal Court Judge Picard suddenly shouted:
    "What is that?" He pointed an angry finger at the blanket covering Jent.
    "It's a blanket!" a court worker replied in surprise.
    "Have you noticed the color?" Picard continued to roar:
    "It's red! Take it away!"
    The court worker dared not delay and immediately carried out the judge's order, tearing the blanket off the patient.
    Red, originally a symbol of joy and happiness, evokes feelings of panic and terror in fascists, showing how much they hate the people's happiness and joy.

    Another "Masterpiece"
    Recently, the Alabama State Legislature in the United States passed a so-called new law. This law stipulates that textbook publishers must include a statement or stamp on their textbooks that reads:
    "The publisher of this textbook or other related teaching materials solemnly declares: The author of this book and the authors of books or works listed as references or supplementary readings are not, and have never been, members of groups or members of groups identified as communist fronts by the United States Congress or any committee or the United States Attorney General."
    This should be considered another "masterpiece" of American Fascistization.

    The Reality Reflected in the Joke
    On October 20th of last year, the Soviet Literary Gazette published an article exposing McCarthy's crimes, which quoted a joke that had appeared in an American newspaper: A rabbit was running, and a crow asked:
    "What are you running from so fast!"
    "Hiding from Senator McCarthy! He's catching kangaroos!"
    "But you're not a kangaroo?"
    The rabbit, still running, replied:
    "But you try proving that to McCarthy."
    This is a joke, no, this is the terrible reality of America. This reflects the true situation of every kind person living in McCarthy's America, where McCarthyites run rampant, constantly facing persecution, and everyone is in constant danger.
    [Note] Greek mythology says that Mount Olympus is the sacred mountain where the twelve great gods reside.

    法西斯魔影笼罩美国
    最滑稽的“喜剧”
    英国“每日邮报”今年二月登载了一篇题为“笑呢还是哭呢？”的评论，嘲笑美国反共的歇斯底里。这篇文章写道：不久前，美国书报检查机关把古代希腊的著名剧作家、讽刺作品的巨匠阿里斯托芬的喜剧删去了许多段；硬说他在大约二千四百年前写的剧本具有“共产主义思想”。
    阿里斯托芬的喜剧中被删去的一节诗就是：
    “让我把道理来阐明，
    所有的人都应一律平等，
    共享一切欢乐和财富；
    决不许一个人富而其余的人穷。”
    美国戏剧艺术学院院长直率地说：他的学生们拒绝扮演阿里斯托芬喜剧中的角色，因为他们害怕当局说他们是“赤色分子”。
    这篇文章写道：“要是你听到声震九天的大笑，你就知道那是奥伦帕斯山〔注〕上的神在笑。阿里斯托芬本人也为这出从他那时候起还不曾有过的最滑稽的喜剧大笑不已。”
    对“红色”的恐怖
    据塔斯社纽约二月十七日电讯报道：美国联邦法院陪审团以违反所谓史密斯法的“罪名”对密执安州六个共产党领袖进行宣判。被告之一珍特虽然患着重病，也被迫用担架抬着出庭。宣判之前，在法庭上发生了一件小小的风波。
    请看美国报纸对这个小小风波的描绘吧！当抬着珍特的担架走进法庭时，联邦法院的法官毕卡德突然叫了起来：
    “这是什么？”他恶狠狠地用手指着珍特身上盖着的一条毯子。
    “是毯子呀！”一个法院工作人员惊讶地回答。
    “你注意颜色了吗？”毕卡德继续咆哮着：
    “是红色的呀！拿走！”
    法院工作人员不敢怠慢，立即执行了法官的命令，把毯子从病人身上扯下来了。
    红色，本来是快乐幸福的象征，但是引起法西斯党徒们的感觉却是惊慌和恐怖，可见，他们是多么仇恨人民的快乐和幸福了。
    又一“杰作”
    最近，美国亚拉巴马州州议会通过了一项所谓新法律。这项法律规定：凡是教科书的出版商一定要在他们的教科书上附印一个这样的声明或戳记：
    “本教科书或其他有关的辅导教材的出版者郑重声明：本书的作者以及书中列为参考或补充读物的书籍或作品的作者，现在不是、过去也不是被美国国会或任何委员会或美国司法部长指出属于共产党阵线的团体或成员”。
    这该算美国法西斯化的又一“杰作”了吧。
    笑话反映的现实
    去年十月二十日，苏联文学报刊登了一篇揭露麦卡锡罪行的文章，文章里引用了一家美国报纸曾经登过的一个笑话：一只兔子在奔跑，老鸦问道：
    “你跑得这样快是躲什么呀！”
    “躲参议员麦卡锡呀！他在捉袋鼠哩！”
    “可是，你不是袋鼠呀？”
    兔子一面还在奔跑，一面答道：
    “但你去向麦卡锡证明这点试试看。”
    这是一个笑话，不，这是美国可怕的现实。这反映了生活在麦卡锡、党徒横行的美国，每一个善良的人民时时都有受到迫害、人人自危的真实情况。
    〔注〕希腊神话中说奥伦帕斯山是十二大神居住的神山。
