    An Anti-War Village in Cambodia

    Beside an important highway in Kampong Cham Province, eastern Cambodia, lies a village. This village originally had more than a thousand residents, and they had surplus rice every year in addition to their own consumption. The village had rows of beautiful houses and spacious courtyards, with rows of palm trees planted on both sides of the red dirt path crossing the village.

    In 1950, French colonialists occupied this village. They set fire to almost all the houses, stole or killed thousands of cattle and poultry, and cut down palm trees to build fortifications; by April 1952, in less than half a year, they had burned 300,000 kilograms of grain. The invaders also forced nearly a thousand households from this village and nearby villages to leave their homes and concentrate around the French military strongholds. There, thousands of people were crammed into simple huts behind three layers of dense barbed wire, and hundreds of men and women died of starvation and disease.

    But many villagers escaped from the enemy's clutches and lived in the jungle with the people's guerrillas.

    After the enemy withdrew from the village, the guerrillas led the people back to the village. They rebuilt their houses and prepared to fight the enemy. Young people who had escaped from the enemy's clutches joined the guerrillas one after another. The Cambodian Resistance Government also sent cadres to the village to help the residents rebuild their homes.

    In the first few months, the residents had to live on porridge and wild vegetables. Later, they started farming and reclaimed the barren rice fields. After harvesting the crops last year, every family had enough food.

    With the recovery of production, the residents also worked hard to build this anti-war village. In every corner of the village, they set up stake pits and traps. The guerrillas also made flintlock guns out of iron pipes.

    Every time the French army "swept" this village, they were attacked by the guerrillas. This village is only five kilometers away from the enemy's stronghold. In the past, dozens of enemy troops dared to come and "sweep" through, but now, even if the enemy has hundreds of people, they dare not act recklessly. Once, five guerrillas defeated an enemy's "sweep" and annihilated twenty-five enemies. The guerrillas sometimes also attacked the enemy's strongholds. They once rescued hundreds of civilians imprisoned in French concentration camps.

    The resistance movement in this village is rising day by day, and the relationship between the people and the guerrillas is getting closer and closer. After the rice was harvested, when the farmers celebrated the victorious harvest, every household set aside the best rice for the guerrillas. An old woman told the guerrillas: "The Cambodian people love rice fields because they are our main source of wealth. The Cambodian People's Liberation Army and the guerrillas follow Chairman Son Ngoc Minh's instructions to fight the enemy and protect our rice fields. Therefore, I want to thank Chairman Son Ngoc Minh and thank you—dear children, you have made it possible for us to cultivate the land freely and eat this bowl of rice."

### 高棉的一个抗战村庄

    高棉的一个抗战村庄
    在高棉东部磅湛省境内的一条重要公路旁边有一个村庄。这村庄原来有一千多居民，他们每年收获的大米除自己吃用外，还有剩余。这村庄有一排排美丽的房屋和宽阔的庭院，横过村庄的红土小路的两旁，种着一行行棕榈树。
    一九五○年，法国殖民者侵占了这个村庄。他们放火烧毁了几乎所有的房屋，抢走或杀死了数千耕牛和家禽，又砍下棕榈树来构筑工事；截至一九五二年四月为止，在不到半年中，他们烧毁了三十万公斤谷米。侵略者还强迫这个村庄和附近村庄的近千户人家离开家乡，集中到法军据点的周围。在那里，几千人民挤在三层密密的铁丝网后面的简陋的茅屋内，成百的男女死于饥饿和疾病中。
    但是有许多村民们逃出了敌人的虎口，和人民游击队一起住在丛林里。
    敌人从村庄撤退以后，游击队就带领人民回到这个村庄。他们重新修建了自己的住宅，并准备着和敌人作战，从敌人魔掌中逃出来的青年纷纷加入了游击队；高棉抗战政府也派干部到村庄来帮助居民重建家园。
    最初的几个月，居民们不得不吃粥和野菜过活，以后，他们开始了耕作，又开垦了荒芜的稻田，到去年收割庄稼以后，每一家的粮食都够吃了。
    随着生产的恢复，居民也努力加紧建设这个抗战的村庄。在村庄的每一个角落，他们布置了桩板坑和陷阱。游击队也用铁管子做成燧发枪。
    法军每次“扫荡”这个村庄都遭到游击队的袭击。这个村庄离敌人据点只有五公里，在过去，几十个敌军就敢来“扫荡”，现在，即使敌人有几百人也不敢放肆行动了。有一次，有五个游击队员就击败了一股敌军的“扫荡”，并歼灭了二十五个敌人。游击队有时还袭击敌人的据点。他们曾救出被关在法军集中营的几百平民。
    这个村庄的抵抗运动日益高涨，人民和游击队的关系一天天密切，当收割稻谷以后，农民们在庆祝胜利的丰收时，每一户都为游击队留下了最好的大米。一位老妇人告诉游击队员说：“高棉人民爱稻田，因为它是我们主要的财源。高棉人民解放军和游击队遵照山玉明主席的指示，和敌人斗争，保护我们的稻田。因此我要感谢山玉明主席，感谢你们——亲爱的孩子们，你们使得我们能够自由地耕地，能够吃到这一碗饭。”
