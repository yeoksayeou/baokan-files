    A good social order is an important prerequisite for our country to carry out large-scale economic construction, as well as an important prerequisite for developing agricultural production, developing mutual aid and cooperation, and implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Without a good social order, it is difficult to imagine the victory of this great cause.
    In recent years, through various social reform movements, especially the land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the feudal land system has been thoroughly destroyed, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been severely打击(dǎjī strike, hit, attack, crack down on), and reactionary secret societies have been banned. The social security in the vast rural areas of our country has been consolidated, ensuring the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production. However, it must also be seen that the hidden counter-revolutionary elements have not been completely eliminated, the reactionary secret societies have not been completely destroyed, and some elements of the overthrown landlord class are still stubbornly hostile to the people. Some hooligans and vagrants left over from the old society have not been completely reformed. In some rural areas, these elements are still colluding with each other, constantly looking for opportunities to create and spread various rumors to provoke the relationship between the masses and the People's Government; they are organized to steal and destroy state grain, wires and railway equipment, and sabotage crops and water conservancy facilities; even in a few backward areas, there have been a few, but serious, destructive incidents of arson of granaries, assassination and murder of revolutionary cadres, or highway robbery. Although these counter-revolutionary sabotage activities are all doomed to fail, we should not forget the lessons of these events. With the increasing development of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the enemy feels that they are approaching extinction, and they will inevitably take more insidious and vicious means to oppose us and sabotage us.
    However, at present, some cadres and peasants engaged in rural work have insufficient understanding of the complexity and acuteness of the struggle between the enemy and ourselves. They believe that there is no class struggle in the countryside after the land reform; that there are no counter-revolutionary elements in the countryside after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; and even if there are some, they are not worth worrying about. This atmosphere is even stronger in the old liberated areas. Therefore, they gradually relaxed their political vigilance, no longer paying attention to rural public security work, ignoring rumors, and not investigating suspicious elements; even if they are found, they are not punished according to law. As a result of this underestimation and complacency, in some places counter-revolutionary elements, lawless landlord elements and other bad elements have infiltrated into rural grassroots organizations, using their powers to harm the people; or they have mixed into mutual aid groups and cooperatives, provoking relations between group members and cooperative members, and sabotaging agricultural production; some counter-revolutionary elements who have been released after serving their sentences or are under control have also found opportunities to carry out sabotage activities again because we have relaxed control.
    These situations show that some rural work cadres are indifferent to the international and domestic political situations that are closely related to our country's construction cause. They do not understand: First, our country is still facing encirclement by imperialism. The imperialists who extremely hate the Chinese people have been trying in many ways to gather various conspirators, traitors of the motherland, and die-hard counter-revolutionary elements, and send them to sneak into our country to engage in sabotage and destruction, attempting to subvert our people's democratic dictatorship regime from within. The struggle between the enemy and ourselves will continue for a long time. Second, the resolute counter-revolutionary elements among the classes that have been overthrown within our country, as well as the hidden counter-revolutionary spies and agents, cannot be completely eliminated by one vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionary movement. The resolute counter-revolutionary elements among the classes that have been overthrown and will be eliminated will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities for a long time. Although a small number of hooligans, vagrants and other bad elements do not necessarily have a political background, due to the intensification and dramatization of class struggle, they are very easily bought and used by counter-revolutionary elements and become accomplices and henchmen of counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. Third, most of the peasants lack cultural and scientific knowledge, and many people still have superstitious and backward ideas. Therefore, although they hate imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements, they cannot keenly identify disguised spies, agents, and counter-revolutionary elements, especially easily believe the rumors fabricated by spies, agents, counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary secret societies, causing self-disturbance and social unrest. It is impossible to fundamentally change this situation of lacking cultural and scientific knowledge in a short period of time. This greatly increases the arduousness and complexity of our struggle with the counter-revolutionaries.
    In order to further consolidate rural social security, protect the safety of peasants' lives and property, and ensure the smooth progress of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, local party committees and people's governments should regard educating rural cadres and peasants to raise their political vigilance as a regular and important task. They should be good at using some typical examples to explain to them why it is necessary to constantly raise vigilance after the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement. Everyone should understand that the struggle against enemy agents and counter-revolutionary elements is not only a matter for the state public security organs, but also a matter for every people's mass. Only by actively assisting the people's public security organs in eliminating the enemy's sabotage activities can we ensure the safety of the state and our own lives and property, and ensure the smooth progress of agricultural production and construction. At the same time, people should also be told some common knowledge about anti-espionage and anti-special agents, so that people can identify various spies, agents, and counter-revolutionary elements and fight against them. Many facts in the past suppression of counter-revolutionary movement show that giving play to the enthusiasm of the people's masses in the struggle against the enemy is an extremely important factor for us to win the struggle.
    The people's public security organs and judicial organs should strengthen the investigation and detection of enemy agents and counter-revolutionary elements' sabotage activities and trial work. Local people's courts and people's procuratorates should combine with the central work in rural areas at various periods to send out circuit courts or circuit inspection teams to promptly inspect and handle various cases that disrupt social order and endanger agricultural production and construction. For major typical cases, they should also be handled with great fanfare to expose the enemy's crimes, educate the masses and cadres, and raise revolutionary vigilance. If any state employee causes losses due to serious negligence and invites the enemy's sabotage, the relevant party and government organs should strictly investigate the responsibility and give appropriate punishment according to the severity of their mistakes. Only in this way can we learn from the lessons and constantly improve our work, so that all counter-revolutionary elements will have no chance to take advantage of.
    The militia organization and the grassroots public security and security committee organization are powerful assistants of the people's public security organs. They should be rectified at any time to make them sound, assist the people's public security organs in clearing and arresting escaped counter-revolutionary elements, and strengthen the control of counter-revolutionary elements and lawless landlord elements. If the control work is slack, the reasons must be found and corrected in time. Special attention should be paid to a small number of backward villages where counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary landlords have usurped the party and government leadership.
    Since the season of spring plowing production has arrived, at present, all localities should take strictly preventing counter-revolutionary elements from sabotaging agricultural production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and water conservancy facilities as the central link in rural public security and security work. At the same time, around the state grain warehouses, it is necessary to establish a practical working system for preventing special agents, fire prevention, and theft prevention to ensure that the grain is not lost.

### 进一步巩固农村治安保卫农业生产建设

    进一步巩固农村治安保卫农业生产建设
    良好的社会秩序，是我们国家进行大规模经济建设的重要前提，也是发展农业生产、发展互助合作、实行农业的社会主义改造的重要前提。没有良好的社会秩序，这一伟大事业的胜利是很难设想的。
    最近几年来，经过各种社会改革运动，特别是经过土地改革和镇压反革命运动，彻底摧毁了封建的土地制度，严厉打击了残余反革命势力，取缔了反动会道门，我国广大农村的社会治安已经巩固起来，保障了农业生产的迅速恢复和发展。但是也必须看到，暗藏的反革命分子并没有完全肃清，反动会道门也还没有彻底摧毁，已被打倒的地主阶级中还有一些分子坚决与人民为敌，旧社会遗留下来的地痞、流氓也还没有全部得到改造。在部分地区的农村中，这些分子还在互相勾结，不断地寻找各种机会，制造和散布各种谣言，以挑拨群众和人民政府的关系；有组织地盗窃和毁坏国家的粮食、电线和铁路器材，破坏农作物和水利设施；甚至在我们少数工作落后的地区，发生过纵火焚烧粮仓，暗害和凶杀革命干部，或者拦路行劫的少数的但却是严重的破坏事件。这些反革命破坏活动虽然都是不能得逞的，但我们却不应该忘记这些事件的教训。随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益发展，敌人感到他们自己日益接近于灭亡，就必然要采取更加阴险毒辣的手段来反对我们，破坏我们。
    但是，目前在从事农村工作的干部和农民中，却有一部分人对于敌我斗争的这种复杂性和尖锐性认识不足，以为土地改革以后农村没有阶级斗争了；镇压反革命运动以后农村没有反革命分子了；即使还有一些，也不足为患了。在老解放区，这种空气更为浓厚。因此，他们逐渐松弛了政治警惕，不再注意农村的治安保卫工作，听见谣言不追不驳，看见可疑分子也不查不究；即便查着了，也不依法惩办。这种轻敌麻痹思想发展的结果，有的地方就有反革命分子、不法地主分子和其他坏分子钻进了农村基层组织，利用职权危害人民；或者混进互助组和合作社，挑拨组员间、社员间的关系，破坏农业生产；有些徒刑期满释放或在管制之中的反革命分子，也因我们放松管制而重新找到了进行破坏活动的机会。
    这些情况说明，有一部分农村工作干部对于密切关系着我们国家建设事业的国际和国内政治情况是漠不关心的。他们不了解；第一、我国目前仍然面临着帝国主义的包围。极端仇视中国人民的帝国主义者，一直在多方面地网罗各种阴谋家、祖国的叛徒、死心塌地的反革命分子，派遣他们潜入我国境内从事捣乱和破坏，企图从内部来颠覆我国人民民主专政的政权。敌我的斗争，将长期继续下去。第二，我国内部已被打倒的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，以及暗藏着的反革命特务间谍，决不是一次轰轰烈烈的镇压反革命运动所能全部肃清的。已被打倒和将被消灭的阶级中的坚决反革命分子，必然要和外国帝国主义勾结起来，长期地进行反革命破坏活动。少数地痞、流氓等坏分子，虽然原来并不一定有政治背景，但由于阶级斗争的尖锐化，剧烈化，他们极容易为反革命分子所收买利用，成为反革命破坏活动的帮凶和爪牙。第三，大部分农民群众缺乏文化科学知识，不少人还有迷信落后思想，因而他们虽然仇恨帝国主义和反革命分子，但却不能敏锐地识别伪装起来的特务间谍和反革命分子，特别是容易轻信特务、间谍、反革命分子和反动会道门所制造的谣言，自相惊扰，造成社会不安。要根本改变这种缺乏文化科学知识的情况，决不是短时期内所能办到的。这就大大地增加了我们和反革命进行斗争的艰巨性和复杂性。
    为了进一步巩固农村的社会治安，保障农民生命财产的安全，保障农业生产和互助合作运动的顺利进行，各地党委和人民政府应该把教育农村干部和农民群众提高政治警惕，当作一项经常的重要工作。要善于通过一些典型的事例，向他们说明为什么在镇压反革命运动以后还需要经常提高警惕。要使每个人都懂得：反对敌特反革命分子的斗争，不仅是国家公安机关的事情，也是每个人民群众自己的事情。只有积极地协助人民公安机关肃清了敌人的破坏活动，才能保障国家和自己生命财产的安全，保障农业生产建设的顺利进行。同时，也要告诉人民一些防谍反特的普通知识，使人民能够识别各种间谍、特务与反革命分子，并和他们进行斗争。过去镇压反革命运动中的许多事实说明，发挥人民群众对敌斗争的积极性，这是我们取得斗争胜利的一个极其重要的因素。
    人民公安机关和司法机关，应该加强对敌特反革命分子破坏活动的侦查破案工作和审判工作。各地人民法院和人民检察署应结合农村各个时期的中心工作，派出巡回法庭或巡回检察组，及时检察处理各种扰乱社会治安、危害农业生产建设的案件。对于重大的典型案件，还应大张旗鼓地处理，以揭露敌人的罪恶，教育群众和干部，提高革命警惕。在国家工作人员中，如果有人因严重的麻痹大意而招致敌人的破坏，造成损失的，有关的党政机关应严格追究责任，按照他们所犯错误的大小给予适当处分。只有这样，才能吸取教训，不断改进我们的工作，使一切反革命分子无隙可乘。
    民兵组织和基层治安保卫委员会的组织，是人民公安机关的有力助手，应该随时加以整顿，使它健全起来，协助人民公安机关清查和逮捕漏网的反革命分子，并加强对反革命分子和不法地主分子的管制。管制工作松懈的，必须找出原因，及时纠正。在一些被反革命分子和反动地主等篡夺过党政领导权的少数落后乡村，更应特别注意。
    由于春耕生产的季节已经来到，目前各地应以严防反革命分子破坏农业生产、互助合作运动和水利设施当作农村治安保卫工作的中心环节。同时，在国家粮食仓库的周围，要建立起切实可行的防特、防火、防盗等工作制度，以保证粮食不受损失。
