    Central Ministry of Commerce Issues Circular to State-Owned Commercial Departments in Various Regions to Conscientiously Conduct Spring Warehouse Security Inspections
    The Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce recently issued a circular requiring commercial departments in various regions to conscientiously conduct spring warehouse security inspection work and earnestly implement the principle of "prevention first."
    The circular listed the fire, theft, and other accidents that occurred in various regions last winter and this spring, and pointed out that the main reasons for the accidents were that some leading cadres relaxed their leadership over warehouses, some warehouse personnel were irresponsible, and management systems were not strict. For example, the on-duty personnel of the wholesale department warehouse of the Benxi City Native Products Company played cards and drank alcohol all night during the Spring Festival, and did not pay attention to safekeeping; the guards of the Shangqiu Department Store Supply Station in Henan held a wedding ceremony in the match warehouse; the fire prevention commander of the Tonghua City Industrial Equipment Company in Liaodong was not replaced after being transferred; the Gaiping and Fuxian Coal and Construction Companies used fire trucks as oil pumping trucks; in addition, many warehouse staff did not know how to use fire-fighting equipment.
    The circular concluded by pointing out: As the weather gradually warms in the spring, hibernating pests begin to hatch, and especially since cotton, oil, and various industrial products purchased in various regions will be successively entering warehouses in large quantities, in order to prevent sabotage by hidden enemies and mold, rot, and insect pests, and to ensure the safety of commodity storage, commercial administrative departments in various regions are required, under the leadership of the Party and government, to conduct a step-by-step spring security inspection of their affiliated warehouses. The inspection should cover whether the security organization (including public security and defense, guards, and fire-fighting organizations) is sound; whether warehouse equipment and fire-fighting equipment are used and stored properly; and whether the storage of goods is reasonable. At the same time, attention should also be paid to fire prevention, anti-espionage, anti-theft, water prevention, mildew prevention, and warehouse hygiene.

    中央商业部通报各地国营商业部门
    切实进行春季仓库保安检查
    中央人民政府商业部最近发出通报，要求各地商业部门切实进行春季仓库保安检查工作，认真贯彻“预防为主”的方针。
    通报列举了去冬今春各地发生火灾、盗窃等事故的情况，指出发生事故的主要原因是由于部分领导干部放松对仓库的领导，某些仓储人员不负责任，管理制度不严等。如本溪市土产公司批发部仓库值宿人员春节时通宵打牌、喝酒，不注意保管；河南商邱百货供应站警卫人员在火柴仓库内举行婚礼；辽东通化市工业器材公司防火指挥员调动后未予补充；盖平、复县煤建公司将防火车当作抽油车；此外很多仓库工作人员还不会使用消防用具。
    通报最后指出：春季天气日渐转暖，蛰伏害虫开始孵化，特别是目前各地收购的棉花、油料及各种工业用品将要陆续大量进库，为了防止暗藏的敌人的破坏和霉烂、虫害，保证商品保管安全，要求各地商业行政部门，在党、政领导下，对所属仓库，进行一次有步骤的春季保安检查。对保安组织（包括治安保卫、警卫和消防组织）是否健全；仓储用具、消防设备使用、保管是否得当；商品的堆存是否合理等情况都须检查。同时对防火、防特、防盗、防水、防霉及仓库卫生等工作亦应引起注意。
