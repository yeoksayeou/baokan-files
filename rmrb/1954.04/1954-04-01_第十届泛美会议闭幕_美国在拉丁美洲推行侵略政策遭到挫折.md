Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch from New York: The Tenth Pan-American Conference, which lasted for four weeks in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, closed on March 28th. The results of the conference show that the U.S. government's attempts to continue pursuing its aggressive foreign policy and predatory economic policies in Latin America have encountered serious difficulties.

From the first day of the conference until its conclusion, the United States and its Latin American neighbors displayed serious differences on important political and economic issues. A proposal put forward by the U.S. delegation at the beginning of the conference, ostensibly on the subject of anti-communism but in essence aimed at legalizing U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, was met with fierce opposition from representatives of some Latin American countries, particularly the representative of Guatemala. As a result, the U.S. delegation had to add an amendment to its proposal and exert strong pressure on some Latin American countries to get the proposal passed. Despite this, the Guatemalan representative consistently exposed the U.S. imperialist policy at the conference and openly expressed his defense of the national interests of Latin American countries. At the closing meeting on the 28th, the Guatemalan delegation once again formally protested the "anti-communism" resolution, which was passed under strong U.S. pressure and attempted to interfere in Latin American internal affairs.

On economic issues, the U.S. attempt to maintain its monopolistic economic policy toward Latin American countries suffered a setback. The "embargoes," unequal trade, import restrictions, and economic encroachment on Latin American countries carried out by the United States have brought disastrous consequences to Latin American countries. Therefore, most Latin American countries put forward many proposals on economic issues at the conference, opposing U.S. economic plunder. For example, Guatemala and Bolivia proposed the implementation of land reform in Latin American countries, which passed with seventeen votes. The passage of this proposal means that Latin American countries are in favor of confiscating land belonging to foreign companies.

The U.S. delegation's attempt to oppose the Venezuelan representative's proposal to abolish import restrictions on raw materials, agricultural products, and semi-finished products by industrialized countries also failed. This proposal passed with seventeen votes. The United States and Cuba voted against it. When voting on a proposal on trade conditions, the United States was completely isolated with one dissenting vote.

The United States suffered another significant defeat in the discussion of the U.S. "surplus" agricultural products proposal. The dumping of U.S. agricultural products is the most serious threat to the economies of Latin American countries, which mainly export raw materials and agricultural products. The proposal recommended that American countries take measures to ensure that the sale of U.S. agricultural products does not harm their economies. This proposal passed with seventeen votes, with the United States and Bolivia abstaining.

Another resolution passed at the conference reflected the dissatisfaction of Latin American countries with the U.S. "embargo" policy. This resolution instructed the United States to consider the economic impact of the "embargo" on Latin American countries. In addition, at the conference, the U.S. representative's attempt to oppose the proposal put forward by the Argentine representative demanding the end of the colonial system and territorial occupation in the Western Hemisphere also failed. Argentina's proposal was supported by all participating Latin American countries.

    第十届泛美会议闭幕
    美国在拉丁美洲推行侵略政策遭到挫折
   【新华社三十一日讯】纽约消息：在委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯召开的历时四星期的第十届泛美会议已于三月二十八日闭幕。会议的结果表明：美国政府在拉丁美洲继续推行其侵略的外交政策和掠夺性的经济政策的企图，遭到了严重的困难。
    从会议开始的第一天起直到会议结束，美国与它的拉丁美洲邻国在重要的政治与经济问题上，表现出严重的分歧。美国代表团在会议一开始提出的一个以反共为题目而实质上是要使美国干涉拉丁美洲各国内政的行为合法化的提案，遭到拉丁美洲国家的一些代表首先是危地马拉代表的猛烈反对。因此，美国代表团不得不在自己的提案上补上一段修正案，并对一些拉丁美洲国家加以强大压力才使提案得以通过。尽管如此，危地马拉代表在会上自始至终揭穿美国的帝国主义政策，并公开表示维护拉丁美洲国家的民族利益。在二十八日的闭幕会议上，危地马拉代表团再一次正式抗议在美国的强大压力下通过的、企图干涉拉丁美洲内政的“反对共产主义”决议。
    在经济问题上，美国想保持对拉丁美洲国家的垄断经济政策遭到挫折。美国所执行的“禁运”、不等价贸易、入口限制以及对拉丁美洲国家的经济侵入，给拉丁美洲国家带来灾难性的后果。因此，大多数拉丁美洲国家在会上提出许多有关经济问题的议案，反对美国的经济掠夺。例如，危地马拉和玻利维亚提出在拉丁美洲各国实行土地改革的议案，并以十七票获得通过。这个议案的通过，就意味着拉丁美洲国家赞成没收属于外国公司的土地。
    美国代表团反对委内瑞拉代表提出的取消工业发达的国家对原料、农产品和半制成品的入口限制的议案的企图也未能成功。这个议案以十七票获得通过。美国与古巴投反对票。在表决一项关于贸易条件的议案时，美国以一票的反对票而处于完全孤立的地位。
    在讨论关于美国的“过剩”农产品的议案时，美国遭到又一次显著的失败。美国农产品的倾销，是对以原料和农产品为主要输出品的拉丁美洲国家经济最严重的威胁。议案建议美洲国家采取措施，保证美国农产品的销售不至于损害它们的经济。这个议案以十七票通过，美国和玻利维亚弃权。
    会议上通过的另一个决议反映了拉丁美洲各国对美国“禁运”政策的不满，这项决议责成美国考虑“禁运”给拉丁美洲各国造成的经济影响。此外，在会上，美国代表企图反对阿根廷代表提出的要求结束在西半球的殖民制度和领土占领的提案，也遭到失败。阿根廷的提案得到全体与会的拉丁美洲国家的支持。
