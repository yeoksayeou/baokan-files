Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at a public gathering in Bombay on the 11th, expressed his hope for the success of the Geneva Conference and a swift ceasefire in Indochina.

    Nehru said that the two main threats to world peace were the Korean issue and the war in Indochina. A ceasefire had been achieved in Korea, but it could not be said that genuine peace had been reached. The war in Indochina was still ongoing. He said, "It would be best if both of these problems were resolved, or at least the war in Indochina should be stopped." He said he hoped for a swift ceasefire in Indochina.

    Nehru also said that the threat of dropping hydrogen bombs "can only make the situation worse, and we cannot achieve peace through this kind of threat." He said, "I should not interfere in other people's affairs, but now this issue has become relevant to everyone, so I must say this: Now is not the time for provocation and threats." He said, "The atmosphere in the world today is so bad that while convening meetings to negotiate peace, one country is still threatening another."

    Nehru expressed his hope that the representatives attending the upcoming Geneva Conference "will calmly consider the urgent problems facing the world—Korea and Indochina—and seek a solution for them, so that the world can have peace and happiness."

    希望日内瓦会议成功在印度支那实现停火
    【新华社十三日讯】印度总理尼赫鲁十一日在孟买公众集会上发表演说，表示希望日内瓦会议获得成功和在印度支那迅速实现停火。
    尼赫鲁说，世界和平所遭到的两个主要威胁是朝鲜问题和印度支那战争。朝鲜已经实现了停火，但不能说已达成真正的和平。印度支那的战争还在进行。他说：“如果这两个问题都得到了解决，那是最好的事，或者至少应该使印度支那战争停止。”他说，他希望在印度支那能迅速实现停火。
    尼赫鲁又说，投掷氢弹的威胁“只能使局势更加恶化，我们是不可能通过这种威胁来实现和平的”。他说：“我本来不应去干涉别人的事，但是，现在这个问题已经变成与每一个人有关的问题了，因此，我就要这样说：目前不是挑衅和威胁的时候。”他说：“今天世界上的气氛是这样的坏，以致于在召集来谈判和平的会议时，一个国家还在对另一个国家进行威胁。”
    尼赫鲁表示，他希望出席即将举行的日内瓦会议的代表们“将冷静地考虑世界所面临的迫切问题——朝鲜和印度支那问题，为它们谋得一个解决的办法，这样世界才能得到和平与幸福。”
