    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 4th: According to TASS, on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary by the Soviet army—April 3rd, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Council of Ministers held a celebration meeting in Budapest. Members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, headed by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Mátyás Rákosi, heads of various ministries of the government, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Imre Nagy, and the Soviet Ambassador to Hungary, Kiselyov, and others attended the meeting.

   【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：在苏联军队解放匈牙利九周年前夕——四月三日，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和部长会议在布达佩斯举行了庆祝大会。以匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记马·拉科西为首的中央委员会政治局委员和书记处书记，以部长会议主席伊·纳吉为首的政府各部首长，和苏联驻匈牙利大使基谢列夫等参加了大会。
    会上，劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员、部长会议副主席阿普罗做了关于苏军解放匈牙利九周年的报告。阿普罗说，四月四日不但是我们解放的节日，而且也是我们新生的节日，是牢不可破的匈苏友谊的节日。他接着谈到了匈牙利人民在劳动人民党的领导下、在苏联兄弟般的帮助下，以及在各人民民主国家的合作下所取得的巨大成就。他说：今天匈牙利工业产量已增为战前的三倍半。匈牙利目前已能够生产过去匈牙利工业从来不能生产的机器和消费品。去年下半年，由于提高工资、减低物价和关怀劳动人民生活福利的结果，全国人民的收入增加了四十多亿福林（匈币名）。阿普罗还着重指出党和政府去年十二月所通过的关于发展农业的决议，对匈牙利进一步向社会主义发展的重大意义。阿普罗在谈到国际问题时，表示欢迎苏联政府为巩固和平和各国人民的安全所采取的各项步骤。
