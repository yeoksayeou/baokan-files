The cadres Zhang Zhong and Li Gengyao of the Beijing Railway Transportation Bureau's Machinery Department suggested trial-burning mud coal (coal dust left over after washing raw coal) in shunting locomotives, and the experiment has been successful. The Beijing Bureau plans to universally promote this method in all shunting locomotives throughout the bureau in early April.

After studying the general line, Zhang Zhong and Li Gengyao realized that the machinery department could accumulate funds for the country not only by transporting more goods, but also by saving fuel coal. Seeing that the use of mud coal in fixed boilers had good results, saved the country a large amount of good coal, and reduced costs, they thought of using mud coal in shunting locomotives. They put forward this suggestion, which was supported by the leadership, and then found locomotive ㄇㄎ11-3776, which had the busiest shunting operations at the Xizhimen Locomotive Turnaround Depot, to conduct the experiment.

As soon as the experiment started, the mud coal contained too much water, almost like slurry. With one shovel, the mud coal stuck to the shovel and could not be fed into the firebox. After studying it, they put a bucket of water in front of the firebox and dipped each shovel in water before adding it, so that the mud coal would not stick to the shovel and could be fed in. However, it piled up in clumps and was very uneven. Later, they sprinkled less water on the coal, stirred the coal dust into lumps, and then added it to the furnace. This made the mud coal in the furnace very even, the flames were strong, and the boiler steam was very good. The crew members said: This method is good, burning mud coal is no different from burning good coal.

If the method of using mud coal instead of good coal in shunting locomotives is promoted throughout the bureau, it will save over 653 million yuan in expenses each year. The 7,800 tons of good coal saved in a year can supply locomotives from Nankou to Fengtai for 2,015 round trips, and can haul 28.8 million ton-kilometers between the two places.

### 北京铁路运输分局在调车机车上试烧泥煤成功

    北京铁路运输分局在调车机车上试烧泥煤成功
    北京铁路运输分局机务科干部张忠、李庚尧两人，建议在调车机车上试烧泥煤（原煤经过水洗后剩下的煤末子）已试验成功。北京分局准备于四月初在全分局调车机车上普遍推广这一办法。
    张忠和李庚尧在学习总路线后，认识到机务部门给国家积累资金，除了多拉货物，就得从节省燃煤上着手。他俩看到固定锅炉使用泥煤效果良好，给国家节省了大批好煤，降低了成本，就联想到调车机车上使用泥煤。他们提出了这个建议，得到领导方面的支持，就在西直门机务折返段找到调车作业最忙的冖ㄎ11三七七六号机车，进行试验。
    刚一试验，由于泥煤上洒水过多，跟稀泥差不多，用锹一铲，泥煤就沾在锹上，送不进炉门去。他们研究以后，就在炉门前放一桶水，每添一锹，先蘸一下水，这样，泥煤不沾锹，也送进去了。但是，一堆一片，很不均匀。后来，他们在煤上少洒水，把煤粉搅成疙疸，再往炉里添，这样炉里的泥煤就很均匀了，火苗很旺，锅的蒸汽很好。乘务员们说：这个办法好，烧泥煤跟烧好煤没有什么区别。
    在调车机车上用泥煤代替好煤的办法如在全分局推广后，每年将节省开支六亿五千三百多万元。一年中节省下来的七千八百多吨好煤，能供南口到丰台的机车走二千零十五个来回，可在这两地之间牵引二万八千八百万吨公里。
