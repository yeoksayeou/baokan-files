Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 12th. Indian newspapers generally criticized the U.S. government's policy of attempting to expand intervention in the Indochina War and obstructing the success of the Geneva Conference.

　　The "New Century" editorial on the 10th stated: From all indications, Eisenhower and Dulles not only want the Geneva Conference to fail, but are also preparing to expand the war in Asia. The editorial pointed out that the United States is "forcing its allies to obey American orders like faithful colonies," and "as the Geneva Conference approaches, the United States' pressure on France is gradually increasing, and so is its pressure on Britain." The editorial called on the Indian people to express their demand for the success of the Geneva Conference.

　　The "Blitz" weekly editorial said: "Dulles, having been forced to agree to the Geneva Conference against his will, will attend the Geneva Conference with America's various disruptive weapons. There is a shameless lawyer's code that says when you have no reason, scold the plaintiff's lawyer. The United States attempts to follow this code by raising the hackneyed tune of the 'Communist aggression' threat to divert world opinion from its policy of war and destruction."

　　Commenting on Dulles's clamor for "united action" to intervene in the Indochina War, the "Times of India" editorial on the 10th stated: "It is clear that Mr. Dulles has not been discouraged by the failure of military intervention in Korea, and he insists that a 'tough' policy is the only solution." The editorial criticized Dulles's remarks slandering China in a "rude and provocative tone," pointing out that Dulles's attempt "to undermine the Geneva Conference in this way is surprising and disappointing." "Unfortunately, only the United States believes that problems can be solved by ultimatums and threats."

　　The "Bombay Chronicle" editorial on the 9th wrote: "Those concerned about the issue of peace in Southeast Asia cannot welcome the stubborn stance taken by American politicians. These American politicians openly say that they believe it is impossible to achieve peace in Indochina through negotiation, and therefore, the war must continue until a decisive victory is achieved." The editorial condemned the United States for preparing to conduct negotiations with a "domineering attitude."

　　The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorial on the 9th stated: If one reads the recent speeches by U.S. Vice President Nixon, Senator Nolan, and Secretary of State Dulles, one will see that the United States is the real opponent of resolving the Indochina issue through consultation. The editorial said: "The recent situation, especially the disturbing speeches of some American leaders, is fraught with dangerous potential consequences. If the Americans really intend to create such consequences, then there is no need to cover up their true intentions in Indochina with seemingly grand words."

　　The Hindi daily "Nava Bharat" published an editorial on the 8th stating: The prospect of holding the Geneva Conference after the Berlin Conference has aroused great hopes among the people of the world. However, "this situation is naturally unfavorable to the American warmongers, and they have quickly begun to sabotage the Geneva Conference." The editorial pointed out: "The U.S. government is not only desperately opposed to a ceasefire in Indochina, but is also launching new conspiracies to further expand the war in Indochina, which makes the situation before the Geneva Conference even more complicated."

    印度报纸抨击美国加紧干预印度支那战争
    并指责杜勒斯竭力使日内瓦会议前的形势复杂化
    【新华社新德里十二日电】　印度报纸普遍抨击美国政府企图扩大干涉印度支那战争并阻挠日内瓦会议获得成就的政策。
    “新世纪报”十日社论说：从所有的迹象看来，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯不仅想使日内瓦会议不能成功，而且准备在亚洲扩大战争。社论指出：美国正“迫使它的盟国像忠实的殖民地一样服从美国的命令”，“随着日内瓦会议的日益接近，美国对法国的压力也逐渐加大，对英国也是一样”。社论号召印度人民表示要求日内瓦会议成功。
      “闪电”周报社论说：“杜勒斯既已被迫违反自己的意志同意举行日内瓦会议，他就会带着美国的各种捣乱武器去参加日内瓦会议。有一条无耻的律师守则说，当你没有理由的时候就骂原告的律师。美国企图根据这个守则，提出‘共产党侵略’威胁的滥调来转移世界舆论对它的战争与破坏政策的不满。”
    “印度时报”十日社论在评论杜勒斯叫嚣以“联合行动”干涉印度支那战争后说：“很明显，杜勒斯先生并没有由于在朝鲜军事干涉的失败而灰心，他坚持认为‘强硬’政策是唯一的解决办法。”社论批评杜勒斯以“粗鲁和挑衅的口气”诬蔑中国的言论，指出：杜勒斯企图“借此损害日内瓦会议，这种态度是令人惊异和失望的”。“很不幸，只有美国相信可以用最后通牒和威胁的办法来解决问题”。
    “孟买纪事报”九日社论写道：“关心东南亚和平问题的人们不能欢迎美国政治家所采取的顽固立场。这些美国政治家公然说，他们相信，通过谈判来实现印度支那和平是不可能的，因此，战争必须进行到决定胜负时为止。”社论谴责美国准备用
  “专横的态度”来进行谈判。
      “甘露市场报”九日社论说：如果读一读美国副总统尼克松、参议员诺兰以及国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的演说，就会看到，真正反对通过协商解决印度支那问题的是美国。社论说：“最近的形势，特别是美国某些领袖的扰乱人心的演说，充满了危险的可能后果。如果美国人真有造成这种后果的意思，那就大可不必用似乎是堂而皇之的话来遮掩他们在印度支那的真正意图了。”
    印地文日报“新国家报”八日发表社论说：柏林会议以后召开日内瓦会议的前景，已经引起全世界人民很大的希望。但是，“这种形势对于美国的战争贩子们自然是不利的，他们赶快开始了破坏日内瓦会议的勾当”。社论指出：“美国政府不仅拚命反对在印度支那停火，而且还发动新的阴谋要使印度支那的战争更加扩大，这就使得日内瓦会议以前的形势更加复杂。”
