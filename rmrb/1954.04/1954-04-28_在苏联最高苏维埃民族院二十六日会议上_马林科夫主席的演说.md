Comrade Deputies, the draft state budget submitted by the government to the Supreme Soviet for consideration fully reflects the Communist Party's policy of further developing the Soviet economy, increasing the people's welfare, ensuring national defense, and consolidating the strength of our motherland (applause).

The substantial increase in the state budget is an indicator of our country's economic progress. The 1954 state budget revenue will increase by 149 billion rubles compared to 1950, more than three times the pre-war 1940 budget revenue (applause). It should be taken into account that the budget is increasing under the condition that the Party and government consistently adhere to reducing retail prices for food and manufactured goods. The decrease in state revenue caused by the reduction of consumer goods prices is compensated by the increase in revenue caused by the increase in production, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction of production costs of socialist enterprises. This year, nearly 327 billion rubles will be allocated for the development of the national economy. This means that investment in the national economy will increase by 57 percent compared to 1950. Most of this allocation will be used as basic investment.

In 1954, the allocation to meet the social and cultural needs of the Soviet people will be 141 billion rubles, which is almost equal to the total expenditure of the 1939 state budget. Like in previous years, the speed of development of the Soviet national economy continues to maintain a level that capitalist countries—even those with the most developed economies—cannot dream of.

In the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, industrial production increased by 45 percent, of which the production of means of production increased by 46 percent, and the production of consumer goods increased by 43 percent. During this period, the number of employees in the national economy increased by nearly six million; the real wages of employees increased by 30 percent, and the total income of employees and farmers increased by 34 percent (calculated at comparable prices).

While striving to expand the front of peaceful construction, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the government tirelessly care for further strengthening the Soviet Union's defense capabilities. The Soviet armed forces now and in the future have all the necessary conditions to fulfill their lofty mission—defending the country and being ready at any time to give a crushing rebuff to aggressors who dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of our people (stormy, prolonged applause).

The completion of this year's industrial tasks will mean a great step forward in the development of the Soviet economy. The following figures are sufficient to illustrate the problem: In 1954, steel production will increase by 51 percent compared to 1950, coal—33 percent, electricity—63 percent, cement—more than 80 percent, machines and equipment—90 percent; the production of consumer goods will increase by more than 60 percent, and the volume of commodity circulation will increase by 75 percent. The tasks in consumer goods production and commodity circulation stipulated in the Five-Year Plan will be completed four years ahead of schedule (applause).

As everyone knows, the Party and the government have taken important measures to further develop agriculture. In order to increase grain production, the sown area is being expanded, mainly by reclaiming virgin and fallow land; the number of tractors and agricultural machinery produced and supplied to the countryside is increasing greatly, which makes it possible to achieve a higher level of mechanization of agricultural production; machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms are increasing the number of cadres—agronomists, livestock experts, agricultural machinery operators, and other experts. A flexible system is being implemented to encourage and stimulate the maximum development of agricultural production, in order to create the necessary conditions to coordinate the ever-growing needs of residents for agricultural products and of industry for agricultural raw materials with the simultaneous increase in agricultural product output. The increase in agricultural product output is to be achieved on the basis of increasing the material benefits and economic incentives for the rural laborers who produce these products.

To successfully complete the tasks facing our country, it is necessary for all departments of the national economy, all departments of socialist construction, all factories, all collective farms and state farms, all machine tractor stations, and all our organizations to ensure the unconditional completion of the tasks stipulated in the adopted national economic plan. We have many advanced industrial enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations that achieve great success year after year by improving production organization and labor organization methods. At the same time, we also have enterprises that have not completed their tasks, which produce low-quality products and waste materials and money. We have many collective farms and state farms that are not operating satisfactorily. In order to move forward more quickly, we must bravely expose and resolutely eliminate the shortcomings, backwardness, and neglect that still exist in some of our departments.

The results of the first quarter of this year prove that, on the whole, industry has successfully completed the quarterly plan. However, several ministries have not completed the plan on some important items. Among them are the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, the Ministry of the Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machine Building, and the Ministry of the Timber Industry. The basic construction plans of many ministries have not been completed well, and new equipment has not been put into use in a timely manner.

As everyone knows, to complete the national economic plan, it is necessary to fully and effectively utilize every day, because it is not easy to make up for wasted time. If the plan cannot be completed on time, especially if a certain department cannot complete the national plan, it will cause disconnections in the production of industrial enterprises and greatly damage the national economy. Unfortunately, we still have some responsible cadres who have become accustomed to seeing the enterprises under their management work hot and cold and not complete their plans. Many ministries are too slow and inflexible in organizing the planned and balanced production of industrial enterprises every month. Eliminating the irregular work of factories, mines, construction sites, railways, and shipping lines as soon as possible, and strictly abiding by the production and work plans of enterprises every day, is the primary task of all workers in industry and transportation.

Many enterprises not complying with technical standards in production is also a major shortcoming in industrial work. This is precisely what explains why many factories produce goods of poor quality that do not meet specifications and consumer needs. This phenomenon cannot be tolerated any longer. The ministries must more quickly restore production order in enterprises that have violated production technical standards, and they must ensure that every enterprise only produces high-quality products.

As everyone knows, vigorously improving labor productivity is the main and decisive condition for further improving and developing the national economy.

Since the socialist method of production has been firmly established in our country, labor productivity in all sectors of the economy has greatly improved. Due to the technological transformation of enterprises and the putting into production of new enterprises equipped with the most efficient equipment, great achievements have been made in utilizing industrial production capacity.

However, in recent years, the increase in labor productivity in some sectors of the national economy has seriously lagged behind. For example, in 1953, many factories in the metallurgical industry, a considerable number of factories in the machine-building industry, some factories in the cotton textile industry, and factories in some other industries did not complete the task of increasing labor productivity as stipulated. The implementation of the plan to increase labor productivity in the timber industry, the coal mining industry, and especially in the construction industry, is unsatisfactory.

The instructions of the 19th Party Congress stipulate that the increase in labor productivity from 1951 to 1955 should be: approximately 50 percent in industry, 55 percent in construction, and 40 percent in agriculture. In order to ensure the implementation of the instructions of the Party Congress, all departments of socialist construction must intensify their work in the last two years of this five-year plan.

The Soviet national economy currently has all the necessary conditions to ensure a more rapid increase in labor productivity. Our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, has provided the Soviet national economy with a strong technical foundation. In the post-war years alone, industry has acquired new equipment and machinery worth more than 150 billion rubles, transportation—50 billion rubles, and agriculture—more than 60 billion rubles. The number of equipment and machinery that can save and reduce labor and increase labor productivity is increasing year by year.

In order to further develop heavy industry, which is the backbone of the entire national economy and national strength, we must continue to strive to expand the construction of power stations, so that a strong power base in the form of electrical energy becomes the foundation of all sectors of production—including agricultural production. U.I. Lenin once pointed out: "Large-scale industry suitable for the latest technical standards and capable of transforming agriculture is national electrification." Therefore, our most important national economic task at present is to continue to promote electrification in a way that enables the increase in power generation to exceed the speed and scale of development in other economic sectors.

Due to the need to further improve labor productivity, we must greatly strengthen the implementation of comprehensive mechanization, that is, to make it include not only the main production process, but also various intermediate and auxiliary processes, because these processes often use more people than the main production process.

The issue of fully and effectively utilizing all existing equipment in all sectors of the national economy—industry, transportation, and agriculture—is a very sharp issue. From time to time, we still encounter some responsible persons in industrial enterprises, or even industrial departments, whose enthusiasm is one-sided. They are very enthusiastic when they ask the state to issue technical equipment to the enterprises under their management, but then they show the most disorganized neglect of the equipment they receive. In this regard, we must urge the serious attention of the various ministries of the coal mining industry and the timber industry. In the first quarter of this year, as in last year, more than 40 percent of the coal mining combined machines, coal cutting machines, approximately half of the coal loading machines, and more than 30 percent of the rock loading machines in the coal mining industry were not used. In the timber industry, as much as 40 percent of the machinery and equipment were not used due to malfunctions, while equipment in good condition was not fully utilized. In many machine manufacturing plants, the utilization of equipment is also unsatisfactory. We must stop the attitude of not cherishing equipment and machinery in industry, transportation, and agriculture. Our economic leaders, engineers, technicians, foremen, and all production leaders must show greater concern for the economical use of the equipment they manage, and must do everything possible to improve the utilization of equipment.

One of the important conditions for further rapidly improving labor productivity is the widespread utilization of scientific and technological achievements in industrial and agricultural production. Our people are proud of the achievements of Soviet science, which have opened up new and vast possibilities for technological progress. The increasingly large-scale utilization of atomic energy for the security of our motherland and for peaceful industrial purposes is a great contribution of Soviet scientists (stormy applause). We must further increase the degree of practical application of scientific and technological achievements and strengthen the ties between scientific workers, scientific institutions, and production. There is no doubt that Soviet scientists will make new and significant contributions to strengthening our motherland's national strength and solving the task of further improving the productivity of social labor (applause).

Therefore, the task now is to: strive to improve production technology on the basis of electrification, make greater use of scientific and technological achievements in production, widely implement the overall mechanization of all production departments, fully utilize all existing machinery and equipment, and every enterprise must strictly abide by the regulations on technical operations in production, and strive to improve the quality of products.

The increase in the technical equipment of our national economy is closely related to the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working people. It will soon be a reality that all the younger generation participating in production in cities and villages will have a secondary education (applause). Now, every year, nine million workers and peasants are taking advanced studies in various technical training classes and organizations. However, in the production training of laborers, many places are still handicraft-like, and the large sums of money allocated by the state in this regard are often not used rationally. The leaders of the various ministries and departments must take on this huge and important task and constantly care for the further improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working people. Without further improving the organization of production, it will be impossible to greatly improve the labor productivity of industry, transportation, and agriculture. In this regard, we have made certain achievements. However, there are still many shortcomings in some economic sectors and many enterprises, and eliminating these shortcomings can greatly expand production and improve labor productivity.

The correct allocation of labor resources is of great significance. As everyone knows, in our Soviet society, the only legitimate principle for establishing any organization is to use social labor prudently, systematically, and economically. However, many ministries and departments repeatedly violate this principle, allowing administrative management institutions to become bloated and complex, thereby harming the development of production. Although the administrative management organs have been streamlined, they still appear to be large. The current ratio of the number of personnel directly engaged in production to the number of personnel in management and service departments needs to be further adjusted to favor material production.

With the growth of the material and technical foundation of the national economy, the improvement of the welfare, political, cultural, and production levels of the working people, the requirements for labor discipline must also be raised. The main point is that socialist labor discipline inevitably requires learning from advanced production models, high labor productivity, and high product quality. When Lenin talked about the new essence of labor discipline in Soviet society, he said that it was "automatic and proactive" discipline. The brilliant thought of the great Lenin is vividly reflected in the movement of production innovators and advanced figures. There is no doubt that tens of thousands of new people will learn the achievements of our glorious pioneers who strive to improve labor productivity; the ranks of production innovators and advanced figures will grow day by day. This is one of the powerful sources for further improving our entire economy (applause).

The great superiority of our socialist system lies in the fact that we have every possibility to develop the national economy on a solid scientific basis. The great achievements of the Soviet planning system are well known to all. We should more resolutely overcome the shortcomings in planning work that hinder the full utilization of all the advantages of the planning system.

In addition to formulating the main tasks, our planning organs often try to determine many details of the economic activities of industrial enterprises, construction sites, railways, state farms, collective farms, trade enterprises, and other organizations from the central government. However, in doing this work, due to the lack of due understanding of various local conditions and possibilities, it is often not up to the requirements. It is obvious that this kind of planning creates difficulties for local work and binds the initiative of local institutions.

The government has taken measures to reduce some of the tasks stipulated in the annual plans for industrial and agricultural production. This has produced positive results. However, the requirements of the national economy for planning work are increasing and becoming more complicated day by day. Therefore, our central planning organs, especially the State Planning Committee, should first of all focus their attention on the most important national economic issues: determining the correct proportions of the development of various departments, eliminating weaknesses, and maximizing the existing potential of the national economy, so as to obtain greater results with less investment.

We must strive to improve the work of various industrial enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, railways, water transport, and all aspects of socialist construction, fight more resolutely to improve labor productivity and reduce product costs, practice strict economy, eliminate all phenomena of unrestrained consumption, and effectively manage finances. The responsibility of all our economic cadres and production managers is to explore the potential of various departments of the national economy and utilize it, and strive to achieve the greatest results with the least expenditure.

In order to more fully utilize the huge possibilities possessed by our socialist economy, it is necessary to constantly improve the work of state and economic organs, and improve the work of every link of state organs. The requirements for Soviet state organs are constantly increasing. In order to meet these requirements, we have the responsibility to constantly improve state organs, and more deeply implement the principles that the great Lenin believed should be the foundation of Soviet state organs—the connection with the broad masses of the people, economy, encouragement of creative initiative, and fighting against bureaucracy in any form.

At present, the Party has put forward the task of guaranteeing a rapid increase in the production of food and daily-use industrial products in a short period of time (within two or three years) on the basis of a further economic upsurge in the country. Under these circumstances, the issue of conscientiously strengthening the sense of responsibility of every worker in the state and economic organs for their work is of particular significance.

Now, when we are fighting to quickly solve truly historical tasks, every day's work should truly have its results. This requires us to make strenuous efforts in our leadership cadres, and in the staff of government and economic organizations. We must effectively and resolutely eradicate procrastination, eliminate all phenomena that violate state discipline, and overcome irresponsible and formalistic attitudes towards completing state tasks. We must tirelessly improve the sense of responsibility of our staff to the Party and to the state.

Our Party is launching a resolute attack on the backwardness and irresponsibility that exists in some departments of socialist construction. We cannot tolerate the loss of the cause of increasing the people's welfare due to the irresponsible and bureaucratic attitudes of some staff towards their duties.

In order to improve the responsibility of the various ministries of the government, to enable the work of the ministries to exert greater effectiveness, and to ensure the timely solution of economic problems, the government has greatly expanded the powers of the ministers of the various ministries, the heads of the various departments, and the directors of the various general administrations of the ministries. This measure has undoubtedly produced, and will produce, greater positive results.

However, it must be pointed out that there are many such situations: the leaders of individual ministries and departments do not take measures to solve problems that arise at any time, but engage in some unnecessary paperwork, trying to shift responsibility to others. Obviously, it is necessary to quickly eliminate this abnormal phenomenon, so that the various ministries can better and more specifically lead the various enterprises and institutions, solve problems that arise at any time in a timely manner, ensure the overcoming of existing shortcomings, eliminate backwardness, and conscientiously lead the work of adopting and promoting advanced experience, and scientific and technological achievements in production.

When talking about the activities of the various ministries in this regard, it should be talked about the following situation. As everyone knows, a year ago we merged a number of ministries. However, we later found that this merger caused certain difficulties in making specific leadership to enterprises, especially when the various ministries had to directly implement the new tasks put forward by our Party. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that for the sake of the cause, the institutions of the various ministries should be adjusted as necessary, but the policy of further reducing the expenditure of state organs must be strictly implemented.

The Party Central Committee and the government require all links of the Soviet state organs, and all organ workers, to carry out their work on the basis of the strictest compliance with the law, and to safeguard the rights of the Soviet people. In the future, organ workers, no matter who they are, no matter what position they hold, will be severely punished if they have rude and illegal acts against Soviet citizens (applause).

Comrades, the domestic policy of our Party and government has always been: to continuously strengthen the power of the socialist state, consolidate the great friendship of our various nationalities, consolidate the unbreakable alliance of the working class and collective farmers, strive to develop the economy and culture, persistently consolidate the Soviet national defense, and ensure the further rapid increase in the people's welfare (stormy applause).

Under the leadership of our glorious Communist Party, the Soviet people will surely achieve new and decisive achievements in the cause of building a communist society (stormy applause).

Comrade Deputies! In international affairs, the first thing to note is that in recent times there has been some easing of tensions. There is no doubt that this easing is the result of the active opposition of the forces of peace to the aggressive policies of the powerful groups in the United States and its satellite states.

The efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace have in fact become a powerful driving force of the contemporary era. This effort is the basis of such a major development process, under which many countries in Europe and Asia are now living under the sign of this major development process. What we are referring to is the process of the unity of healthy forces in all countries to defend peace and the security of the people of all countries.

Progressive humanity sees and knows that the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries play a major role in easing international tensions (applause). The Soviet Union's policy of consolidating peace has won the great trust of peace-loving people in all countries in the Soviet Union. We cherish this trust sacredly. We know that it is our most precious moral capital (applause).

In the vast regions of the earth, the unbreakable friendship of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the various People's Democratic countries has been firmly established, which has a huge impact on the entire contemporary international situation (stormy, prolonged applause).

In 1953, a new page was opened in the history of the great Chinese people. The People's Republic of China began to implement the first five-year plan to improve and transform the country's economy. The heroic efforts made by the Chinese people under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party are a reliable guarantee for the successful realization of China's industrialization plan. The Soviet people are proud that they are making a certain contribution to the completion of this task (stormy applause).

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the European People's Democratic countries are vigorously assisting the fraternal Korean people to restore their economy devastated by the war (stormy applause).

The friendship between the Soviet people and the German Democratic Republic has become deeper and more solid. The German Democratic Republic is an important factor in restoring the national unity of the German people and transforming Germany into a peace-loving country, and therefore its international role is increasing day by day (stormy applause).

 The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the development of foreign trade and economic relations. Last year, more than fifty countries traded with our country, of which twenty-five countries traded with our country on the basis of one-year and long-term trade agreements. From 1948 to 1953, the volume of the Soviet Union's foreign trade almost increased by two and a quarter times. Trade with the various People's Democratic countries has greatly developed. As for trade with capitalist countries, what is hindering the development of this trade is the discriminatory policy implemented under the pressure of the ruling groups in the United States. Facts have proved that the discriminatory policy is unwise and short-sighted, and it has caused serious losses to those countries that obey the United States' orders. Obviously, the discriminatory policy has gone bankrupt. If some figures in the United States still disregard this obvious lesson and continue to implement the discriminatory policy, then only the United States will suffer in this matter. The Soviet Union will continue to expand foreign trade with all countries that are willing to develop trade with us in the future.

As you all know, the Soviet government has taken some steps to ensure friendly relations with all neighboring countries. These efforts have achieved certain positive results, although they have not received the due response from officials in some countries. For example, Turkish officials do not seem to be as concerned about establishing good neighborly relations as the Soviet Union is. The principle of mutual benefit is the basis of good neighborliness and friendship. The Soviet Union has consistently, and will always, take this principle as its starting point.

The Soviet people have a particularly clear understanding of the international situation. Therefore, they want to warn today: Do not overestimate the significance of the easing of international tensions that has been achieved so far, because those who oppose the consolidation of peace have not given up their aggressive intentions. They are still continuing to expand armaments, provoke the expansion of the Indochina War, and establish new military bases and military blocs. West German militarists have begun to feel that they are back in the saddle, and are increasingly appearing not as a potential and possible aggressive force, but as a real threat to European security. At the same time, Japan is being vigorously prepared to serve as a shock force for the re-implementation of imperialist aggression in Asia.

The aggressors are artificially maintaining an atmosphere of war hysteria; threatening the world with hydrogen bombs; openly declaring a policy of strength and a long-term cold war policy; and resorting to threats and intimidation.

What is there to say about this?

The first thing to say is: Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is full of enthusiasm, confidence, and an atmosphere of peaceful and creative labor (prolonged applause). But in the United States, even American officials themselves admit that the social atmosphere is being poisoned by emotions of terror, fear, and frustration. This is the result of the policy of threats and intimidation.

Secondly, the Soviet government has consistently taken the position that the capitalist system and the socialist system can coexist peacefully and engage in economic competition with each other. In line with this position, we have always pursued a policy of peace and consolidating international cooperation. However, if the aggressive bloc relies on atomic weapons, decides to act recklessly, and wants to taste the strength and power of the Soviet Union, then there is no doubt that the aggressor will also be countered by the same weapons, and this adventure will inevitably lead to the collapse of the capitalist social system (stormy, prolonged applause). It should be known that the historical lessons of the First and Second World Wars have clearly confirmed this point, and capitalism has greatly reduced its scope of rule after these two World Wars. As everyone knows, as a result of the Second World War, more than one-third of mankind has forever freed itself from capitalism (prolonged applause).

In the current situation, a question has arisen: What is the main task of the forces of peace? The great mission of all peace defenders is to thwart the plans of the aggressive bloc, strive for a further easing of international tensions, and strive to promote peaceful cooperation between countries.

The vital interests of mankind require a solution to the issue of banning atomic weapons. It is our task to make it impossible for atomic energy, this great discovery of human genius, to be used for the mass slaughter of peaceful residents and the destruction of large cities—centers of industry, culture, and science. The Soviet government is working hard to ensure that this task is effectively solved. At the same time, the Soviet government has in the past and now advocates a great and general reduction in armaments and troops.

Everyone is very clear that if relations between the major powers cannot be normalized, international tensions cannot be further eased. This first requires abandoning the discriminatory policy adopted towards the People's Republic of China. The policy adopted by the aggressive bloc towards the great Chinese people is a challenge to the people of Asian countries. This policy is linked to the aggressive bloc's conspiracy to suppress the powerful national liberation movements of the people of Eastern countries. But is it not clear now that the people of Eastern countries are fighting against the conspiracy of the aggressive forces to transform Asia into an area of permanent colonial oppression and slavery, and that the great unity among them is being increasingly consolidated in this struggle? Facts have convinced progressive humanity that the leaders of the People's Republic of China are defenders of national progress, world peace, and friendship among the people of all countries. Restoring all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China is the most urgent international task at present (applause).

Establishing lasting and solid guarantees for European security is the most important condition for consolidating peace. What is referred to here is truly lasting and solid security guarantees, because in the first half of the twentieth century, the land of Europe has already been soaked with the blood of the sons and daughters of the people of European countries. The people of Europe are unwilling to, and cannot allow, and will never allow, Europe to once again become a place of bloodshed and destruction that recurs every twenty years.

Now, among some people across the ocean, it is a fashion to despise Europe, and they insist on saying: See, Europe is terminally ill and is on the verge of ruin. The only solution is for many countries to abandon their national sovereignty. There is such a fashionable theory that says the era of sovereign states is over. This is a gross distortion of the truth. No, the era of sovereign states is not over, and it is now in its heyday. Whoever wants to violate the sovereignty of European countries, whoever wants to transform the state system of Europe, which has been developed and proven by history, according to their own ways, is creating a threat to the vital interests of European security.

The Soviet Union believes that consolidating European security is of paramount importance. Any European country that has the same goal can count on the reliable friendship of the Soviet Union, and can count on the Soviet Union's sincere understanding of its national needs.

European security only has practical significance when it is a collective security of European sovereign states. However, some people are trying to convince us that there seems to be another way to guarantee European security. What way is it? It turns out that it is to revive German militarism and establish a military bloc composed of West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Is it possible to imagine a more insulting attitude towards the vital interests of the people of European countries than this? Indeed, if German militarists can not only receive huge funding to develop their own troops, but will actually command the troops of France, Italy, and other countries in the above-mentioned military bloc, then what will prevent German militarism from taking the entire Western Europe into its own hands? Can the guarantees given by Bonn's politicians, who are now appearing as advocates of "unified Europe," prevent this from happening? Who does not know that Hitler's plan to enslave the people of European countries also stipulated to "unify" Europe around the "steel core of the German Reich"?

To say that within the scope of the "European Defense Community," German militarism can coexist peacefully with France, which will be deprived of its own national army, is a deliberate deception. In fact, the goal is to completely hand over France to the West German revanchists. How did the German fascists start the Second World War in the West? They invaded Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Now the masterminds of the "European Defense Community" are driving West German militarists down the same path. German militarists wanted to use force to permanently enslave France, but they did not succeed. Today, the creators of the "European Defense Community" want to enable German revanchists to achieve victory over France without war.

The conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty in 1942 and the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet Treaty in 1944 laid the foundation for European security after the war. These documents were consolidated by the blood of the best sons of the Soviet, British, and French peoples. Now, the masterminds of the "European Defense Community" are belittling the true significance of the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties.

From all of the above, isn't it a complete lie to say that the "European Defense Community" is established for peaceful purposes rather than for aggressive purposes? Those who revive German militarism are not calculating to consolidate peace, but on the contrary, they want to undermine European security and prepare for another war.

The Soviet government is deeply convinced that the proposal on the All-European Collective Security Treaty it put forward at the Berlin Conference can serve as a true basis for solving the European security issue. Adopting the Soviet proposal is in line with the fundamental interests of consolidating European peace and the national interests of the people of European countries. This applies to the German people to the same extent. The All-European Collective Security Treaty would also prove to be a reliable guarantee of German security.

The aggressive bloc is trying to maintain the divided state of Germany and turn West Germany into a new source of war, while the signing of the All-European Collective Security Treaty would help restore the national unity of the German people and transform Germany into a peaceful and democratic country.

We do not want to isolate the United States from Europe. We believe that there is nothing preventing the US government from also signing the All-European Collective Security Treaty. The Soviet government has also expressed its willingness to negotiate on the matter of participating in the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" under corresponding conditions.

The Soviet Union's foreign policy is consistent and unchanging. The Soviet Union has put forward and is upholding some proposals in front of all mankind, and the realization of these proposals will provide guarantees for lasting peace and the security of the people of all countries.

The starting point of the Soviet Union's policy of consolidating peace is that, in the current situation, peaceful cooperation between countries (regardless of their social system) should and can determine the development of international relations, and should and can guarantee the further continuous easing of international tensions.

What is required to successfully realize peaceful cooperation? To achieve this goal, the countries concerned should first express a common desire and be willing to cooperate on the basis of adhering to the principles of equal rights and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and unconditionally fulfill the obligations they have undertaken. We adhere to the position that in the current situation, if the parties concerned have sincerity and are willing to consider each other's interests, the outstanding international issues should and can be resolved in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace.

All friends and defenders of peace can believe that the Soviet Union will continue to implement the policy of consolidating peace and friendship among the people of all countries in the future (prolonged applause). Comrades, the election of this session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet deputies once again powerfully demonstrated the strength and stability of our multi-ethnic socialist country, demonstrated the true fraternal friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants. This election once again demonstrated that our Party enjoys the heartfelt trust of all the Soviet people (prolonged applause). Our people are firmly convinced from the experience of a half-century of history that their beloved Communist Party, which was tempered and grew up in battle under the leadership of the immortal Lenin, the genius leader and mentor of the working people, and his comrade-in-arms, the great Stalin, is serving the people steadfastly and loyally (prolonged applause).

The Communist Party clearly understands the tasks facing the country in domestic policy and foreign policy, leads the great creative enthusiasm of the Soviet people, and guides our country from victory to victory, to the victory of communism (stormy, prolonged applause, which then turns into cheers. Everyone stands up).

    在苏联最高苏维埃民族院二十六日会议上
    马林科夫主席的演说
    代表同志们，政府提交苏联最高苏维埃会议审议的国家预算草案，充分反映了共产党的进一步发展苏维埃经济和增进人民福利、保证国防和巩固我们祖国的力量的政策（掌声）。
    国家预算的大大增加是我国经济进展的指标。一九五四年国家预算的收入将比一九五○年增加一千四百九十亿卢布，为战前一九四○年预算收入的三倍以上（掌声）。应该考虑到，预算是在党和政府坚持不渝地奉行减低食品和制成品的零售价格的情况下增加的。由于减低消费品价格而造成的国家收入的减少，由社会主义企业增加产量、提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本而造成的收入增加中得到补偿。今年，发展国民经济的拨款将近三千二百七十亿卢布。这意味着国民经济中的投资要比一九五○年增加百分之五十七。这项拨款的大部分将作为基本投资。
    在一九五四年，满足苏联人民的社会和文化需要的拨款为一千四百一十亿卢布，几乎等于一九三九年国家预算的全部支出。像前些年一样，苏联国民经济发展的速度继续保持在资本主义国家——即使是那些经济最发达的国家——所不能梦想的水平上。
    在第五个五年计划的头三年中，工业生产量增加了百分之四十五，其中生产资料的生产量增加了百分之四十六，消费品生产量增加了百分之四十三。在这个时期中，国民经济中的职工人数增加了将近六百万；职工的实际工资增加了百分之三十，职工的收入总数和农民的收入增加了百分之三十四
  （按比较价格计算）。
    共产党中央委员会和政府在尽力扩大和平建设阵地的同时，还不倦地关怀进一步加强苏联的国防力量。苏联武装部队现在和将来都有一切必要的条件来完成他们的崇高使命——保卫国防和随时准备给予胆敢破坏我国人民的和平劳动的侵略者以粉碎性的回击（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    今年工业任务的完成将意味着苏联经济发展向前大大迈进一步。下面几个数字就足以说明问题了：在一九五四年，钢的产量将比一九五○年增加百分之五十一，煤——百分之三十三，电力——百分之六十三，水泥——百分之八十以上，机器和设备——百分之九十；消费品的产量将增加百分之六十以上，商品流通量将增加百分之七十五。五年计划规定的消费品生产和商品流通方面的任务将提前在四年内完成（掌声）。
    大家知道，党和政府采取了重要的措施来进一步发展农业。为了增加谷物产量，播种面积正在扩大，主要的方法是开垦生荒地和熟荒地；生产和供给农村的拖拉机和农业机器的数量正在大大增加，这使得农业生产的机械化有可能达到更高的水平；机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场正在增加干部——农艺师、饲畜专家、农业机器操使者和其他专家。正在实行一种灵活的制度来鼓励并刺激农业生产的最大限度的发展，以便创造必要条件，使居民对农产品和工业对农业原料的不断增长的需要跟农产品产量的同时增加取得协调的配合，而农产品产量的增加是要在增加给生产这些产品的乡村劳动人民的物质利益和经济鼓励的基础上达到的。
    要胜利完成我们国家面临的任务，就要要求国民经济各部门、社会主义建设各部门、各工厂、各集体农庄和国营农场、各机器拖拉机站、我们所有的组织，都保证无条件地完成已通过的国民经济计划所规定的任务。我们有许多先进的工业企业、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，它们通过改进生产组织和劳动组织的方法一年又一年地取得很好的成就。同时，我们也有没有完成它们的任务的企业，这些企业生产质量低的产品，浪费物资和金钱。我们有不少集体农庄和国营农场经营得不能令人满意。为了要更迅速地前进，我们必须勇敢地揭露并坚决地消除我们若干部门还存在的缺点，以及落后和无人过问的现象。
    今年第一季的结果证明，整个说来，工业顺利地完成了季度计划。然而若干部在某些重要项目上没有完成计划。其中有钢铁工业部、石油工业部、运输和重型机器制造工业部、木材工业部等。许多部的基本建设计划完成得不好，没有保证及时地使用新设备。
    大家知道，要完成国民经济计划，就需要充分、有效地利用每一天，因为要弥补浪费了的时间是不容易的。如果不能按时完成计划，特别是某一部门不能完成国家计划，会引起工业企业生产中的脱节现象，并大大损害国民经济。遗憾的是，我们还有一些负责干部，他们已经习惯于看到国家交给他们管理的企业忽冷忽热地工作，而且不完成它们的计划。许多部在组织工业企业每月份有计划的平衡的生产方面，进行得太慢、太不灵活。尽早消除工厂、矿场、建筑工地、铁路和航运线上的工作不规律的现象，逐日严格遵守企业的生产和工作计划，是工业和运输业所有工作人员的首要任务。
    许多企业不遵守生产技术标准也是工业工作中的一个大缺点。这恰恰可以说明，为什么许多工厂生产的货物质量不好，不符合规格和消费者的需要。这种现象不能再容忍下去了。各部必须更迅速地恢复违反了生产技术标准的企业的生产秩序，它们必须保证每一个企业只生产质量高的产品。
    大家知道，大力提高劳动生产率是进一步提高和发展国民经济的主要的决定性的条件。
    自从社会主义的生产方法在我国打稳了基础以后，经济各部门的劳动生产率都大大提高了。由于企业的技术改造以及配备有最有效的设备的新企业投入生产，由于劳动组织的改善，在利用工业生产能力方面获得了很大的成就。
    不过近年来，在国民经济的一些部门里，劳动生产率的提高有严重的落后现象。譬如在一九五三年，冶金工业中有许多工厂、机器制造工业中有相当多的工厂，棉织品工业中的一些工厂以及一些其他工业中的工厂没有完成规定的提高劳动生产率的任务。在木材工业、采煤工业，特别是在建筑业方面，执行提高劳动生产率计划的情况是不能令人满意的。
    第十九次党代表大会的指示规定在一九五一年到一九五五年内劳动生产率的提高数字是：工业大约百分之五十、建筑业百分之五十五、农业百分之四十。为保证党代表大会的指示的执行，在这一个五年计划的最后两年内，社会主义建设的各部门必须加紧工作。
    苏联国民经济目前具有保证劳动生产率更迅速提高的一切必要条件。我们的党在列宁事业的伟大的继承者斯大林同志的领导下已经使得苏联的国民经济有了强大的技术基础。单在战后年代，工业便获得了总值一千五百多亿卢布的新设备和机器，运输业——五百亿卢布，农业——六百多亿卢布。可以节省和减轻劳动并提高劳动生产率的设备和机器的数量一年比一年增加。
    为了进一步发展作为整个国民经济和国家力量的骨干的重工业，必须继续尽力展开电力站的建设工作，以便使电能形式的强大的动力基础成为生产各部门——包括农业生产部门在内——的基础。乌·伊·列宁曾经指出：“适合于最新技术水准并能改造农业的大工业也就是全国电气化。”因此，我们当前最重要的国民经济任务，就是以能够使发电量的增加超过其他经济部门发展的速度和规模，来继续促进电气化。
    由于有进一步提高劳动生产率的需要，我们必须大大加强全面的机械化的实行，这就是说，使得它不仅包括主要的生产过程，而且也包括各种中间和辅助过程，因为这些过程中使用的人往往比主要生产过程还多。
    在国民经济各部门——工业、运输业和农业——充分有效地利用一切现有设备的问题是一个非常尖锐的问题。我们不时还遇见一些工业企业、甚至工业部门的负责人，他们的积极性是带有片面性的。他们向国家提出要求，要求给他们主管的企业发给技术设备的时候热情是很高的，但是接着就对他们所收到的设备表示了最无组织的玩忽态度。在这方面，我们必须促使采煤工业和木材工业各部的严重注意。在今年头一季度，和去年一样，在采煤工业中有百分之四十以上的采煤联合机、截煤机、约占半数的装煤机和百分之三十以上的装石机没有使用。在木材工业中有多达百分之四十的机器和设备因有了故障没有使用，而情况良好的设备又没有加以充分利用。在许多机器制造厂中，利用设备的情况也是不能令人满意的。我们必须制止在工业、运输业和农业中的不爱惜设备和机器的态度。我们的经济负责人、工程师、技术人员、领班、一切生产负责人必须对他们所管理的设备的节省使用表示更大的关切，必须尽一切可能来改善对于设备的利用。
    进一步迅速提高劳动生产率的重要条件之一是在工农业生产中广泛利用科学和技术成就。我国人民以给技术进步打开新的广大可能性的苏维埃科学的成就而感到自豪。为保卫我们祖国的安全以及为了和平的工业目的，对于原子能的规模越来越大的利用是苏联科学家的伟大贡献（暴风雨般的掌声）。必须更加提高实际运用科学和技术成就的程度，密切科学工作者、科学机关和生产的联系。毫无疑问，苏联科学家在加强我们祖国的国力和解决进一步提高社会劳动生产率的任务方面将有新的和重大的贡献（掌声）。
    因此，现在的任务是：在电气化基础上尽力改善生产技术，在生产中更大量地运用科学和技术成就，广泛地实行各生产部门的全盘机械化，充分利用现有的全部机器和设备，每一个企业要严格地遵守生产中技术操作过程的规程，尽力改进产品的质量。
    我国国民经济技术设备的增加是和劳动人民的文化技术水平的提高有密切关系的。城市和乡村中所有参加生产的青年一代都将具有中等教育程度，这已经是为期不远的事了（掌声）。现在每年有九百万工人、农民在各种提高技术的训练班和组织中进修。但是，在劳动者的生产训练方面，有许多地方还是手工业式的，而国家在这方面拨出的大笔资金往往不能合理地使用。各部和各署的领导人必须担负起这一巨大的重要的工作，经常关心劳动人民文化技术水平的进一步的提高。如果不进一步改进生产组织，要大大提高工业、运输业、农业的劳动生产率是不可能的。在这一方面，我们已经取得一定的成就。然而，在一些经济部门和许多企业中还有不少的缺点，这些缺点消灭之后就可以大大地扩大生产和提高劳动生产率。
    正确的配置劳动力具有重大的意义。大家都知道，在我们苏维埃社会里，设立任何机构的唯一合法的原则就是精打细算地、有条理地、节省地使用社会劳动。但是，许多部和署屡屡破坏这一原则，听任行政管理机构臃肿庞杂，以致损害生产的发展。虽然行政管理机关已经实行了精简，但仍然显得庞大。目前直接从事生产的工作人员的数目和管理与服务部门的工作人员的数目的比例需要进一步调整，使之有利于物质生产。
    随着国民经济的物质技术基础的增长，劳动人民的福利及其政治、文化和生产水平的提高，对劳动纪律的要求也要提高。主要之点在于：社会主义的劳动纪律必然要求向先进的生产模范、高度的劳动生产率及高度的产品质量看齐。列宁在谈到苏维埃社会中劳动纪律的崭新的实质时说，这是“自动的与主动的”纪律。卓越的列宁的思想鲜明地反映在生产革新者和先进人物的运动中。毫无疑问，将有成千成万新的人学习我们那些光荣的、尽力提高劳动生产率的带头人物的成就；生产革新者和先进人物的队伍将一天天地壮大起来。这就是进一步提高我们的全部经济的强大的泉源之一（掌声）。
    我们社会主义制度巨大的优越性在于：我们有着一切可能性在严密的科学基础上发展国民经济。苏联计划制度的巨大成就是大家都知道的。我们应该更加坚决地克服计划工作中有碍充分利用计划制度的一切优越性的缺点。
    我们的计划机关除了拟定主要的任务以外，还常常试图从中央来确定各工业企业、建筑工地、铁路、国营农场、集体农庄、贸易企业和其他组织的经济活动的许多细节。但是在作这项工作时，由于各种各样的地方条件和可能性缺乏应有的了解，因此常常不合乎要求。十分明显，这种计划替地方上的工作造成困难，束缚了地方机构的主动精神。
    政府已经采取措施来减少工业和农业生产的年度计划中规定的一些任务。这已产生了积极的效果。但是，国民经济对计划工作的要求却日益增加和日益复杂了。因此，我们的中央计划机构、特别是国家计划委员会，首先应当把注意力集中在最重要的国民经济问题上：确定各个部门发展的正确比例，消除弱点和最大限度地使用国民经济的现有潜力，以便能以少量的投资获得更大的效果。
    我们必须竭力改善各工业企业、建筑工地、集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、铁路、水运、社会主义建设各方面的工作，更坚决地进行斗争，争取提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本，厉行节约，消除一切无节制的现象，并切实管理财政。我们所有的经济干部、生产管理人员的责任是：发掘国民经济各部门的潜力并加以利用，争取以最少的开支获得最大的效果。
    为了更充分地利用我们社会主义经济所具有的巨大的可能性，必须经常改进国家和经济机关的工作，改进国家机关的每一环节的工作。对苏联国家机关的要求在不断地提高。为了适应这些要求，我们有责任不断地来改进国家机关，更深入地实现伟大的列宁认为应作为苏维埃国家机关的基础的原则——和广大的人民群众的联系、节约、鼓励创造主动性，和以任何形式表现出来的官僚主义作斗争。
    目前，党提出了在短时期内（二、三年内）在国家的经济进一步高涨的基础上，保证急速增加食品和日用工业品的生产的任务，在这种情况下，认真加强国家和经济机关的每一工作人员对自己工作的责任心的问题，就具有特别的意义。
    现在，当我们在为迅速解决真正历史任务而进行斗争时，每一天的工作都应当真正有其成果，因此要求我们领导干部、政府和经济组织的工作人员紧张地努力工作。我们必须切实地、坚决地铲除疲沓作风，消除一切违反国家纪律的现象，克服对完成国家任务所采取的不负责任的、形式主义的态度。必须不倦地提高我们的工作人员对党、对国家的责任感。
    我们党正在向某些社会主义建设部门中存在的落后和无人负责的现象展开坚决进攻，我们不能容忍由于某些工作人员对自己的职责采取了不负责任的和官僚主义的态度，而使增进人民福利的事业遭到损失。
    为了提高政府各部的责任，使各部的工作发挥更大的效能，并保证及时解决经济问题，政府大大地扩大了各部部长、各署署长和部的各总管理处处长的权限。这一措施无疑是已经产生了、而且还将产生更大的积极效果。
    然而不能不指出，有不少这样的情况：个别部、署的领导者不是采取措施来解决随时产生的问题，而是在搞一些不必要的公文，想把责任推到别人身上去。显然，必须迅速消除这种不正常的现象，使各部更好地、更加具体地领导各企业和各机构，及时解决随时产生的问题，保证克服现有的缺点，消除落后现象，认真地领导在生产中采用和推广先进经验、科学和技术成就这一工作。
    谈到各部在这方面的活动时，应当谈谈下面的情况。大家都知道，一年前我们合并了若干部。不过以后我们发现，这种合并使得对企业作具体的领导时发生了一定的困难，特别是当各部要直接执行我们党所提出的新的任务时。因此我们得出结论：为了事业的利益，应该对各部的机构进行必要的调整，但必须严格贯彻进一步缩减国家机关经费开支的方针。
    党中央委员会和政府要求苏维埃国家机关各个环节、所有的机关工作者，必须在最严格地遵守法令的基础上进行工作，维护苏维埃人的权利。今后机关工作者，不管他是什么人、居于什么职位，如对苏维埃公民有粗暴和不法行为，必将给予严惩（掌声）。
    同志们，我们党和政府的国内政策一贯是：不断加强社会主义国家的威力，巩固我国各民族的伟大友谊，巩固工人阶级和集体农民的牢不可破的联盟，竭力发展经济和文化，坚持不懈地巩固苏联国防，保证进一步迅速增进人民的福利（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联人民在我们光荣的共产党的领导下，在建设共产主义社会的事业中，一定会获得新的、决定性的成就（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    代表同志们！在国际事务方面，必须首先注意到：最近以来紧张局势有了一些缓和。毫无疑问，这种缓和是和平力量积极反对美国及其仆从国的有势力集团的侵略方针的结果。
    各国人民争取和平的努力实际上已成为当代的强大动力。这一努力是这样一种重大发展过程的基础，欧、亚两洲许多国家现在就在这种重大发展过程的标志下生活。我们所指的就是各国健康的力量团结起来保卫和平和各国人民的安全的过程。
    进步人类看到而且也知道，苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家的努力对缓和国际紧张局势起着重大的作用（掌声）。苏联的巩固和平的政策博得了各国爱好和平的人民对苏联的极大的信任。我们是神圣地珍视这种信任的。我们知道，它是我们的最宝贵的道义上的资本（掌声）。
    在地球的广大的地区内，已稳固地建立了苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊，这对现代整个国际局势发生着巨大的影响（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    一九五三年，在伟大的中国人民的历史上揭开了新的一页。中华人民共和国开始实现提高和改造国家的经济的第一个五年计划。中国人民在自己的光荣的共产党的领导下所作的英雄的努力，是胜利实现中国工业化计划的可靠保证。苏联人民感到骄傲的是：他们正在为这一任务的完成作出一定的贡献（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲各人民民主国家正在大力援助兄弟的朝鲜人民恢复遭受战争破坏的经济（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联人民和德意志民主共和国之间的友谊更加深厚和巩固了。德意志民主共和国是恢复德国人民的全国统一和把德国改造成为一个爱好和平的国家的重要因素，因而它的国际作用正在一天比一天提高（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联十分重视发展对外贸易和经济关系。去年，和我国进行贸易的有五十多个国家，其中有二十五个国家是根据一年的和长期的贸易协定和我国进行贸易的。从一九四八年到一九五三年，苏联的对外贸易额差不多增为二点二五倍。和各人民民主国家的贸易有了大大的发展。至于谈到和资本主义国家的贸易，正在妨碍着这种贸易的发展的就是在美国统治集团压力下所实行的歧视政策。事实证明：歧视政策是不明智而且是短视的，它使那些唯美国之命是从的国家遭到严重的损失。显然，歧视政策是破产了。如果美国的某些人物仍然不顾这种显而易见的经验教训而继续执行歧视政策的话，那末在这件事上吃亏的只有美国。苏联今后还要继续和一切表示愿意跟我们发展贸易的国家扩展对外贸易。
    你们都已知道，苏联政府曾采取了一些步骤，以保证和一切邻国的友好关系。这些努力都已取得
  一定的积极效果，虽然它们还未得到某些国家的官方人士的应有的反应。例如土耳其的官方人士就是如此，似乎在确立睦邻关系方面土耳其不如苏联那样关心。互利的原则是睦邻友好的基础。苏联过去
  一贯是、而且将来也还是以这个原则为出发点的。
    苏联人民对国际局势的估计特别清醒。因此，他们今天要警告：不要过分夸大目前已取得的国际紧张局势的缓和的意义，因为反对巩固的和平的人没有放弃他们的侵略意图，他们还在继续扩充军备，挑拨扩大印度支那战争，建立新的军事基地和军事集团。西德军国主义分子又开始感觉自己坐上了马鞍，愈来愈显得已不是潜在的和可能的侵略势力，而已是对欧洲安全的一种实际威胁。同时，日本正在被大力准备以充当在亚洲再次实行帝国主义侵略的突击力量。
    侵略分子在人为地保持战争歇斯底里的气氛；以氢弹来威胁世界；公开宣布实力政策和长期冷战的方针；不惜采用威胁和恫吓的手段。
    对于这有什么可说的呢？
    首先要说的是：大家都知道，苏联到处洋溢着兴致勃勃、充满信心和和平创造性劳动的气氛（经久不息的掌声）。但在美国，连美国的官方人士自己也承认：社会空气被恐怖、恐惧和沮丧的情绪所毒化了。这就是威胁和恫吓的政策的结果。
    其次，苏联政府一贯采取的立场是：资本主义制度和社会主义制度完全可以和平共处，而互相进行经济竞赛。我们本着这一立场，始终实行和平和巩固国际合作的政策。但是，如果侵略集团仰仗原子武器，决心蛮干，想尝一尝苏联的力量和威力，那么，不必怀疑，侵略者也将遭到同样武器的反击，而这种冒险必不可免地使资本主义社会制度崩溃（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。要知道，第一次和第二次世界大战的历史教训已明显地证实了这一点，资本主义经过这两次世界大战已大大地缩小了自己的统治范围。大家知道，第二次世界大战的结果，世界上三分之一以上的人类永远摆脱了资本主义（经久不息的掌声）。
    在目前情况下发生了一个问题：和平力量的主要任务是什么？所有和平保卫者的伟大使命就是要粉碎侵略集团的计划，争取国际紧张局势的进一步的缓和，竭力促进各国之间的和平合作。
    人类的切身利益要求解决禁止原子武器的问题。使原子能这一人类天才的伟大发现不可能用来大规模屠杀和平居民、毁灭大城市——工业、文化和科学的中心，这就是我们的任务。苏联政府正在努力使这一任务得到有效的解决。同时，苏联政府过去和现在都主张大大地普遍裁减军备和军队。
    人人都很清楚，如果各大国之间的关系不能正常化，国际紧张局势就不可能得到进一步的缓和。这首先要求抛弃对中华人民共和国所采取的歧视政策。侵略集团对伟大的中国人民所采取的方针是对亚洲各国人民的挑战。这种方针是和侵略集团要镇压东方各国人民的强大的民族解放运动的阴谋相联系的。但是，东方各国的人民正在为反对侵略势力企图变亚洲为永久的殖民压迫和奴役的地区的阴谋而进行斗争，他们之间的伟大的团结在这个斗争中正日益巩固，现在难道这还不明白么？事实使进步的人类相信，领导中华人民共和国的，是民族进步、世界和平和各国人民友谊的捍卫者。恢复中华人民共和国的一切合法权利是当前最迫切的国际任务
  （掌声）。
    建立欧洲安全的持久的、稳固的保障，是巩固和平的最重要的条件。这里指的是真正持久的和稳固的安全保障，因为在二十世纪前半期，欧洲的土地上已经浸透了欧洲各国人民的儿女的鲜血。欧洲人民不愿意，而且不能听任、也决不让欧洲再度成为每隔二十年重演一次的流血和毁灭的场所。
    现在在大洋彼岸的某些人士当中，把轻视欧洲当作是一种时尚，他们硬说：看见没有，欧洲已病入膏肓，并且日趋末途，唯一解救的办法就是许多国家放弃自己的国家主权。有这样一种时髦的理论，说什么主权国家的时代已经过去了。这真是对真理的莫大的歪曲。不，主权国家的时代并没有过去，而且现在正值兴盛的时候。谁想侵犯欧洲各国的主权，谁想按照自己的方式来改造经过历史发展和历史证明的欧洲的国家制度的人，他就是在对欧洲安全的切身利益制造威胁。
    苏联认为巩固欧洲安全具有头等重要的意义。抱有同一目的的任何一个欧洲国家都可以指靠苏联的可靠的友谊，可以指靠苏联对它的民族需要的真挚的了解。
    欧洲的安全只有作为欧洲各主权国家的集体安全时才有现实意义。但是，有人企图使我们相信，似乎还有另外一条保障欧洲安全的道路。怎么样的道路呢？原来就是复活德国军国主义，建立由西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡参加的军事集团。难道还能想像到有比这更带侮辱性的对待欧洲各国人民的切身利益的态度吗？的确，如果说德国军国主义分子不但可以得到发展自己的军队的巨大资助，而且将实际上指挥法国、意大利以及上述军事集团的其他国家的军队，那么，还有什么东西阻止德国军国主义把整个西欧拿到自己手中呢？难道现在以“统一欧洲”的拥护者的角色出现的波恩的政客们所打的包票，可以防止这种做法吗？谁不知道希特勒的奴役欧洲各国人民的计划也是规定要围绕着“德意志帝国钢铁的核心”来“统一”欧洲的呢？
    说什么在“欧洲防务集团”的范围内，德国军国主义可以和将要被剥夺自己的国家军队的法国和平相处，这是一种蓄意的欺骗。实际上，目的就是把法国完全交给西德复仇主义者。德国法西斯在西方发动第二次世界大战是怎样开始的呢？他们侵入丹麦、荷兰、比利时和法国。现在“欧洲防务集团”的主谋者正在驱使西德军国主义者走上同一条道路。德国军国主义者想用武力永远奴役法国，但是没有成功。今天，“欧洲防务集团”的建立者想使德国复仇主义者不经战争就对法国取得胜利。
      一九四二年英苏条约的缔结以及一九四四年法苏条约的缔结奠定了战后欧洲安全的基础。这些文件是由苏联、英国和法国人民的最优秀的儿子的鲜血巩固下来的。现在，“欧洲防务集团”的主谋人正在贬低英苏和法苏条约的真正意义。
    从上述种种看来，关于“欧洲防务集团”建立起来是为了和平目的而不是为了侵略目的的说法难道不是彻头彻尾的谎话吗？那些复活德国军国主义的人盘算的不是巩固和平，而正好相反，他们是想破坏欧洲安全，准备另一次战争。
    苏联政府深信它在柏林会议上提出的关于全欧集体安全条约的建议能够作为真正解决欧洲安全问题的基础。采纳苏联的建议是符合巩固欧洲和平的根本利益和欧洲各国人民的民族利益的。这在同样程度上适用于德国人民。全欧集体安全条约也会证明是德国的安全的可靠保证。
    侵略集团力图保持德国的分裂状态，把西德变为新的战争策源地，而签订全欧集体安全条约就会有助于恢复德国人民的民族统一和改建德国为和平、民主的国家。
    我们不想把美国隔离在欧洲以外。我们认为没有东西阻碍着美国政府也在全欧集体安全条约上签字。苏联政府还表示愿意就在相应的条件下参加“北大西洋公约组织”一事进行谈判。
    苏联的外交政策是始终一贯的，是不变的。苏联在全人类面前提出了并且正在坚持着一些建议，这些建议的实现就会为持久和平和各国人民的安全提供保证。
    苏联的巩固和平的政策的出发点是：在现在的情况下，各国（不问其社会制度如何）的和平合作应当而且能够决定国际关系的发展，应当而且能够保障国际紧张局势的进一步继续缓和。
    要顺利实现和平合作要求些什么呢？要达到这
  一目的，有关各国首先应当表示共同的愿望，愿意在遵守平等权利和不干涉他国内部事务的原则的基础上实行合作，无条件地执行自己承担的义务。我们坚守这样一种立场：在目前的局势下，如果有关各方具有诚意和愿意考虑彼此的利益，悬而未决的国际问题是应该而且能够按照巩固和平的利益加以解决的。
    一切朋友与和平的捍卫者可以相信，苏联今后仍将实行巩固和平和各国人民的友谊的政策（经久不息的掌声）。同志们，这一届苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举，再一次有力地显示了我们多民族的社会主义国家的力量和稳固，显示了苏联各民族的真正兄弟友谊和牢不可破的工农联盟。这一届选举再一次表现出我们的党享有全体苏联人民的衷心的信任
  （经久不息的掌声）。我们的人民从半世纪历史的经验中坚信：在劳动人民的天才领袖和导师不朽的列宁及其战友伟大的斯大林的领导下，并在战斗中成长锻炼出来的他们亲爱的共产党，是坚定地、忠诚地为人民服务的（经久不息的掌声）。
    共产党明确了解国家在国内政策及外交政策方面所面临的任务，领导着苏联人民的伟大的创造热潮，它引导着我们的国家从胜利走向胜利，走向共产主义的胜利（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，继而转为欢呼声。全体起立）。
