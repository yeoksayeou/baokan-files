Hebei Province, with a population of approximately 37 million, has completed election work in all of its 11,500+ urban and rural grassroots political units. Approximately 30,000 cadres throughout the province were involved in handling the election work, and about 1.3 million Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and active elements among the masses participated in the general election propaganda work. Millions of voters enthusiastically participated in the elections, saying: Electing representatives means electing the guides of socialism. If the representatives are not chosen well, mutual aid and cooperation will not go well, production will not be successful, and life will not be good. According to statistics from 2,225 townships, the average voter turnout accounted for 81% of the total number of voters. In cities like Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and Tongzhou, voter turnout reached over 91%. Voters carefully selected outstanding individuals as their representatives. According to statistics from 2,362 townships in 42 counties of six special districts, including Baoding, Dingxian, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Xingtai, over 71,100 representatives were elected, of whom over 53,300 were outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Many model workers in industry and agriculture who had close ties with the broad masses of people, such as Zhao Naibin, model engineer of the state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant, Han Guihua, woman spinning pacesetter of the Tangshan Joint State-Private Hua Xin Textile Mill, Ma Wanshui, labor model of the Longyan Iron Mine, Geng Changsuo, the famous chairman of agricultural producers' cooperative, and Gao Guizhen, model of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, all gained great trust from the voters and were elected as people's representatives.

Through the election, the relationship between the people's government and the people has been further strengthened. When the first sessions of the township people's congresses were held in various places, voters conveyed their demands and opinions to the government through their representatives. When the first people's congresses were held in townships in Shangyi, Zhuolu, Guyuan, and Longguan counties, a total of 3,098 proposals were received, of which constructive proposals accounted for 77%. Some places also raised criticisms of state functionaries, asking them to improve their work. A total of 761 proposals were submitted by 48 townships in Suning County, of which 25% criticized the work style of cadres. After receiving these proposals, many township people's governments organized proposal handling groups, achieving "every proposal has a resolution." Some villages that were originally backward in their work have also made progress after the elections. Jia Zhuang Township in Wu'an County was backward in its work in the past. In the general election, the incompetent old township head was not re-elected, and the township people's government was improved. At the first session of the township people's congress, based on the situation in the township, it was resolved to mobilize the peasants to universally plow and harrow the land that should be plowed and harrowed within three days. After the meeting, the township organized 149 head of livestock and harrowed 1,430 mu of land and plowed 23 mu of land in one day, and universally plowed and harrowed the land in just two days. The voters said: "In the past, the work was backward because there was no leadership. In the future, with the newly elected township government leading us, we must do a better job in production and work." (Xinhua News Agency)

    河北省完成基层选举工作
    约三千七百万人口的河北省，已在一万一千五百多个城、乡政权基层单位全部完成选举工作。全省投入办理选举工作的干部约三万多人，有一百三十万左右的共产党员、青年团员和群众中的积极分子参加了普选宣传工作。千百万选民都以热烈的心情参加选举，他们说：选代表就是选社会主义的带路人，代表选不好，互助合作闹不好，生产搞不好，日子就过不好。据二千二百二十五个乡的统计，参加选举的选民平均占选民总数的百分之八十一。石家庄、张家口、通州等市参加选举的选民达到百分之九十一以上。选民们都认真挑选优秀人物作为自己的代表。据保定、定县、石家庄、唐山、张家口、邢台等六个专区的四十二个县二千三百六十二个乡统计，共选出代表七万一千一百多人，其中优秀的共产党员、青年团员有五万三千三百多人。许多和广大人民有密切联系的工农业劳动模范如国营唐山钢厂模范工程师赵乃斌，唐山公私合营华新纺织厂妇女纺纱旗手韩桂花，龙烟铁矿劳动模范马万水，著名的农业生产合作社社长耿长锁，拥军优属模范高桂珍等，都得到选民的极大信任，当选为人民代表。
    经过选举，人民政府和人民的关系进一步密切了。各地召开第一次乡人民代表大会时，选民们都把自己的要求和意见通过自己的代表反映给政府。尚义、涿鹿、沽源、龙关四县各乡召开第一次人民代表大会时，共收到提案三千零九十八件，属于建设性的提案占百分之七十七。有些地方还给国家工作人员提出批评，要他们改进工作。肃宁县四十八个乡共提出提案七百六十一件，有百分之二十五是批评干部工作作风的。许多乡人民政府收到这些提案后，组织处理提案小组，作到了“案案有着落”。有些原来工作落后的村庄，选举后工作也有了起色。武安县贾庄乡过去工作落后，普选中，不称职的旧乡长落选了，乡人民政府健全了，第一次乡人民代表大会根据本乡情况，决议发动农民用三天时间把该耕该耙的土地普遍耕、耙一次，会后乡里组织了一百四十九头牲口，一天就耙地一千四百三十亩，耕地二十三亩，只两天时间就把土地普遍耕、耙一次。选民们说：早先工作落后，是没人领导。往后新选的乡政府领导，我们一定要把生产和工作搞的更好。（新华社）
