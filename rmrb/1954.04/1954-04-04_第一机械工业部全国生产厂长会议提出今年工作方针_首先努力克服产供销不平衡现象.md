Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd:

    The National Production Plant Directors Conference convened by the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government has summarized the production work of 1953 and deployed the guidelines and tasks for the production work of 1954.

    The conference pointed out that the First Ministry of Machine Building's implementation of the national production plan in 1953 was good. Last year, enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building overfulfilled the national plan in terms of total production value, total commodity value, labor productivity, cost reduction, and profit remittance. Great achievements have also been made in organizing the professional division of labor in enterprises, trial-manufacturing new products, implementing work plans to strengthen enterprise planning management, and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy. While affirming the above achievements, the conference also pointed out that although the machinery industry has made great progress and development last year, its technical and organizational level is still very low, and there are still many difficulties in balancing production, supply, and sales. Therefore, to comprehensively and balancedly complete the national plan, great and multifaceted efforts must still be made.

    After a detailed analysis of the current basic situation of the machinery industry, the conference proposed the guidelines and tasks for production work in 1954: first, strive to overcome the imbalance in production, supply, and sales, to create conditions for further developing production and meeting the needs of national construction. Although the variety of products in the machinery industry has greatly increased in recent years, it is still far from meeting the diverse requirements of national construction for mechanical equipment. Therefore, strengthening product design capabilities and the work of trial-manufacturing new products to increase variety and improve product quality is one of the most important tasks of the machinery manufacturing industry at present. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen sales work, advocate proactively understanding needs and opening up sales channels, and strengthen production collaboration and organize the supply of complete sets of products to further meet national needs. In terms of production and supply, we should vigorously carry out publicity and education on saving raw materials, study methods to reduce material consumption quotas, improve the material reserve system, actively clear out stagnant materials, and mobilize internal resources to strengthen the supply of materials.

    Regarding the improvement and enhancement of enterprise management, the conference pointed out that implementing work plans is the basic link in improving enterprise management. The guideline for 1954 should be to continue to focus on the implementation of work plans, consolidate and improve existing work plan efforts, establish a production area responsibility system around this center, correspondingly strengthen technical management, and use several basic economic indicators from the factory down to the workshop to organize and mobilize the masses of workers to struggle to complete these indicators, thereby improving the advancement of work plans, making work plans reflect higher technical and economic results, and striving to comprehensively and balancedly complete the national plan for the whole year.

    The conference emphasized that in order to implement the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, and to further improve the level of work in the machinery industry, it is necessary to strengthen ideological work. The conference pointed out that to do economic work well, one must first be politically strong, otherwise, one will not see the direction, one will not be able to do technical and economic work well, one will fall into vulgar pragmatism, and one will not be able to resist the intrusion of bourgeois ideology. The basic content of current ideological work should be to oppose individualism and subjectivism, oppose complacency, and oppose the individualistic heroism tendency of not relying on the Party, not relying on the masses, and not giving play to collective strength.

    During the conference, Lu Dingyi, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the meeting and gave a political report on the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, which greatly enlightened and encouraged the representatives attending the meeting. The conference also listened to special reports from Soviet experts on enterprise management, sales work, and other topics, and experience introductions from various factories on implementing work plans, strengthening technical management, and improving the economic effectiveness of work plans.

    The conference was held from March 6th to 21st.

    第一机械工业部全国生产厂长会议提出今年工作方针
    首先努力克服产供销不平衡现象
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府第一机械工业部召开的全国生产厂长会议，总结了一九五三年生产工作，部署了一九五四年生产工作的方针和任务。
    会议指出，一九五三年第一机械工业部执行国家生产计划的情况是良好的。去年第一机械工业部所属企业在生产总值、商品总值、劳动生产率、降低成本、上缴利润等方面都超额完成了国家计划。在组织企业的专业分工，新产品试制，以及推行作业计划加强企业的计划管理，开展增产节约运动等方面，也都取得了很大的成绩。会议在肯定上述成就的同时，也指出了去年机械工业虽然有了很大进步和发展，但技术、组织水平仍然很低，产供销的平衡上还存在着不少困难，因此，要全面地、均衡地完成国家计划，还必须作很大的和多方面的努力。
    会议经过详细分析目前机械工业的基本情况后，提出了一九五四年生产工作的方针和任务：首先要努力克服产供销的不平衡现象，以创造进一步发展生产，满足国家建设需要的条件。机械工业在产品品种上几年来虽有很大发展，但目前还远不能满足国家建设对机械设备的多方面的要求。因此加强产品设计力量和试制新产品的工作，以增加品种并提高产品质量，是机械制造工业当前的极重要的任务之一。此外，还要加强销售工作，提倡主动摸需要，开辟销路，并加强生产协作，组织成套产品的供应工作，以求进一步满足国家需要。在生产供应方面，应大力开展节约原材料的宣传教育工作，研究降低材料消耗定额的办法，改善材料的储备制度，积极清理呆滞物资和动员内部资源，以加强材料的供应工作。
    在企业管理工作的改善和提高方面，会议指出，推行作业计划是改善企业管理的基本环节。一九五四年的方针，应当是继续以推行作业计划为中心，巩固和提高现有的作业计划工作，环绕这一中心建立生产区域责任制，相应地加强技术管理工作，并以若干基本的经济指标，从厂下到车间，组织和动员职工群众为完成这些指标而斗争，从而提高作业计划的先进性，使作业计划体现出更高的技术与经济效果，争取全面、均衡地完成全年国家计划。
    会议强调指出，为了贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，为了进一步提高机械工业工作的水平，必须加强思想工作。会议指出，要作好经济工作，首先必须政治上坚强，否则就看不到方向，就做不好技术和经济工作，就会陷入庸俗的事务主义，对资产阶级思想的侵入就会抵抗不住。当前思想工作的基本内容应该是反对个人主义和主观主义，反对骄傲自满，反对不依靠党，不依靠群众，不发挥集体力量的个人英雄主义倾向。
    会议期间，中共中央宣传部陆定一副部长曾到会作了有关国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的政治报告，给到会代表以极大的启发和鼓舞。会议并听取了苏联专家关于企业管理、销售工作等专题报告，和各工厂关于推行作业计划、加强技术管理、提高作业计划的经济效果等经验介绍。
    会议是在三月六日到二十一日举行的。
