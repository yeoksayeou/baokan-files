To meet the growing demand for coal for people's livelihoods across the country, the state-owned Yangquan Mining Bureau will begin construction of five new coal mines this year.

The Yangquan coalfield has abundant reserves and high-quality coal. The anthracite coal produced has a strong luster, large crystal faces, smooth cleavage surfaces, low sulfur content, and high calorific value. It burns durably and without explosions in furnaces, making it very popular among people in various regions. Since liberation, the mine has undergone vigorous restoration and construction, gradually changing its dilapidated appearance and greatly exceeding the pre-liberation level of production. With the development of the country's planned economic construction, the demand for coal for people's livelihoods will continue to increase. Therefore, according to the instructions of the higher authorities, the Yangquan Mining Bureau has decided to first build five new shafts this year to mine the Seven-Foot Coal and Four-Foot Coal seams. It will also vigorously carry out geological exploration work to prepare for the construction of larger mines in the future.

The entire project for these five new coal mines will begin construction in the third quarter of this year and will be put into production successively by the end of next year. After these five coal mines are put into production, the annual output of the Yangquan Coal Mine will increase by more than 50% compared to 1953.

    阳泉矿务局将建五对新煤井
    国营阳泉矿务局为供应各地人民生活用煤日益增长的需要，今年将开始新建五对煤井。
    阳泉煤田的埋藏量很丰富，煤的质量也很高，所产的无烟煤，光泽强，结晶面大，解劈面光滑，硫分低，发热量高，炉中燃烧耐久不爆，很受各地人民欢迎。解放以来，该矿经过大力恢复和建设，逐渐改变了原来破烂不堪的面貌，产量大大超过了解放以前的水平。随着国家有计划的经济建设的开展，人民生活用煤的需要量将不断提高。因此，阳泉矿务局根据上级的指示，决定今年先新建五对井口，开采七尺煤和四尺煤。并大力进行地质钻探工作，为将来建设更大的矿井作好准备。
    这五对新煤井的全部工程将在今年第三季度开始施工，到明年年底陆续投入生产。这五对煤井投入生产后，阳泉煤矿的年产量，将比一九五三年增加百分之五十以上。
