    Spring Tea in East China Generally Enters the Market
    The new tea purchasing work in East China has been fully launched around April 20th. Tea growth is good in East China this year, and the total tea output of the region is expected to increase by more than 7% compared with last year.
    Since April, the Hangzhou Longjing tea area, the Huangshan tea area in Anhui Province which produces famous teas such as "Qihong" and "Tunlv", and the Dongxi Mountain tea area of Zhenze County in Jiangsu Province, which produces the famous tea "Biluochun", have successively started picking spring tea, and tea purchasing stations in various places have successively launched purchasing work. Before the tea season this year, tea farmers in various places actively carried out weeding, fertilization, and adding tea utensils. Tea farmers in Likuo District, Tacha District and other places producing "Qihong" also newly added more than a dozen hydraulic tea kneading machines. Many mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives have formulated spring tea picking plans to ensure improved tea quality. The tea produced in East China this year will better meet the needs of the domestic people and can be exported to foreign countries in exchange for a large number of industrial equipment. If all the tea planned to be purchased in Huizhou Prefecture, Anhui Province this year is exported to foreign countries, it can be exchanged for more than 65,000 tons of thick steel plates.

    华东区春茶普遍上市
    华东区新茶收购工作已于四月二十日前后全面展开。今年华东各地茶叶生长良好，全区茶叶总产量预计可比去年增加百分之七强。
    四月份以来，杭州龙井茶区、出产名茶“祁红”、“屯绿”的安徽省黄山茶区、出产“碧螺春”名茶的江苏省震泽县东西山茶区等，陆续开始采摘春茶，各地茶叶收购站相继展开收购工作。各地茶农在今年茶季以前都积极进行了锄草、施肥、添置茶具等工作。出产“祁红”的历口区、塔场区等地的茶农还新添置了十几架水力揉茶机。许多互助组和农业生产合作社订出春季采茶计划，保证提高茶叶质量。华东各地今年出产的茶叶，将更好地满足国内人民的需要，并可输出国外，换回大批工业器材。仅安徽省徽州专区今年计划收购的茶叶，如全部输出国外，即可换回厚钢板六万五千多吨。
