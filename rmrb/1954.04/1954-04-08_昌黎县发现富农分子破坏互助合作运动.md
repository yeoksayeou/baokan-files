The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) Changli County Committee of Hebei Province, during its inspection and rectification work of agricultural production cooperatives, discovered that rich peasant elements were carrying out sabotage activities.

The main methods used by rich peasant elements to sabotage the mutual aid and cooperation movement are: seizing upon the weakness of newly established agricultural production cooperatives due to insufficient economic conditions, pretending to be progressive to infiltrate the cooperatives, and then, taking advantage of certain cooperative members' unclear understanding of policy boundaries, spreading sentiments of failure and capitalist management ideas, and creating conflicts among the cooperative members. For example, Liu Zhirui, a rich peasant element from Liu Linzi Village, Third District, pretended to be active and, after worming his way into the cooperative, carried out a series of destructive activities. He first, under the guise of "caring" about the income of the cooperative members, advocated selling seven of the cooperative's nine cattle, then borrowing some money to purchase three rubber-wheeled carts and three large mules to engage in trade. Many cooperative members, due to their recent entry into the cooperative, had an unclear understanding of policy boundaries, and upon hearing him say that transportation and sales were very profitable, diminished their original interest in engaging in agriculture. After the cooperative's director, Liu Yachuan, and deputy director, Liu Bingzheng, discovered the rich peasant element Liu Zhirui's conspiracy, they organized the cooperative members to discuss the direction of development of agricultural production cooperatives, making it clear to the members ideologically that agricultural production cooperatives are production organizations of working peasants and cannot engage in commercial exploitation, thereby exposing Liu Zhirui's conspiracy. After Liu Zhirui's first conspiracy to sabotage the agricultural production cooperative failed, he adopted even more direct and vicious destructive means. When all cooperative members were discussing the cooperative's production issues, he used the method of suppressing land income and expanding cooperative expenditures to calculate accounts for the members, openly spreading sentiments of failure. Later, the leadership of this cooperative, based on the cooperative's production plan of planting according to local conditions, along with the spirit of processing and applying fertilizer, increasing production, and practicing strict economy, recalculated the accounts in detail with the members, which stabilized the members' emotions.

Another means of sabotage used by rich peasant elements is to alienate the solidarity between poor and middle peasants within the cooperative from the outside, instigating middle peasants to withdraw from the cooperative and collapse the cooperative. For example, Gu Fu'en, a rich peasant element from Weigan Village, Fifth District, initially adopted the same methods as Liu Zhirui, attempting to infiltrate the Li Fengwu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the village. Li Fengwu saw through Gu Fu'en's conspiracy and refused him entry into the cooperative. After Gu Fu'en was rebuffed, he directly provoked Cheng Wanjun and Li Yuzhen, middle peasants of the Li Fengwu cooperative, saying: "What benefit is there in being with these poor wretches? Quickly withdraw, and we several households with comparable strength can organize a cooperative!" Under the influence of the withdrawal of these two middle peasant households, another seven cooperative member households also blindly withdrew from the cooperative, destroying this nineteen-household cooperative, leaving only ten households. In order to achieve his goal of thoroughly destroying the Li Fengwu cooperative, Gu Fu'en further encouraged Li Fengyi, the initiator of the Li Fengwu cooperative and of hired peasant origin, to withdraw from the cooperative. Li Fengyi did not fall into his trap and, together with the cooperative cadres, conducted education among the cooperative members against the sabotage of agricultural socialist transformation by rich peasant elements, which consolidated the cooperative and developed it from ten households to fourteen households.

Based on the above facts, the CCP Changli County Committee conducted an exposé at the recently held Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Conference and carried out education on the rural class line. After receiving education, all representatives raised their class consciousness and unanimously expressed that they would learn from the lessons, strengthen the solidarity of middle and poor peasants, resolutely eliminate landlords and rich peasant elements who have infiltrated the cooperative, purify the cooperative's organization; raise vigilance, strictly prevent the sabotage of landlords and rich peasant elements, and ensure the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    昌黎县发现富农分子破坏互助合作运动
    中共河北省昌黎县委在检查和整顿农业生产合作社工作中，发现富农分子进行破坏活动。
    富农分子破坏互助合作运动的主要手段是：抓住新建农业生产合作社经济条件不足的弱点，假装进步混进社里来，然后利用某些社员政策界限不清的弱点，散布失败情绪和资本主义的经营思想，在社员之间制造矛盾。如三区刘林子村富农分子刘致瑞，假装积极，钻到社里以后，就进行了一连串的破坏活动。他首先以“关心”社员收入的面目，主张把社内的九头牛卖掉七头，再贷一部分款，拴三辆胶皮车，买三头大骡子跑买卖。很多社员因入社不久，政策界限不清，又听他说运销得利很大，于是降低了原来经营农业的兴趣。该社社长刘亚川和副社长刘秉政，发觉富农分子刘致瑞的阴谋后，就组织社员讨论农业生产合作社的发展方向，使社员从思想上明确了农业生产合作社是劳动农民的生产组织，不能从事商业剥削，随着揭发了刘致瑞的阴谋。刘致瑞破坏农业生产合作社的第一个阴谋失败后，采取了更直接更毒辣的破坏手段。全体社员讨论社的生产问题时，他用压低土地收入扩大社内开支的方法，给社员们算账，公开散布失败情绪。后来这社的领导上，又根据社内因地种植的生产计划，与加工施肥、增加生产、厉行节约的精神，和社员们重新细算了一下账，才安定了社员的情绪。
    富农分子进行破坏的另一种手段，是从外部离间社内贫农和中农的团结，唆使中农退社，把社搞垮。如五区围杆庄村的富农分子顾福恩，开始也和刘致瑞采取的手段一样，企图钻进该村李凤舞农业生产合作社。李凤舞看透了顾福恩的阴谋，就拒绝他入社。顾福恩碰壁以后，就直接挑拨李凤舞社的中农程万钧和李玉珍说：“跟些穷棒子们在一块有啥光沾，赶紧出来咱们几户人马相当的组织一个社吧！”在这两户中农出社的影响下，另有七户社员也盲目地退了社。把这个十九户的社，破坏得只剩下了十户。顾福恩为达到他彻底破坏李凤舞社的目的，更进一步鼓动李凤舞社的发起人、雇农出身的李凤义退社。李凤义没有上他的圈套，并协同社干部向社员进行了反对富农分子破坏农业社会主义改造的教育，使社得到了巩固，并在十户的基础上发展到十四户。
    中共昌黎县委根据以上事实，在最近召开的互助合作代表会议上进行了揭发，并进行了农村阶级路线的教育。全体代表受到教育后，提高了阶级觉悟，一致表示要接受教训，加强中贫农的团结，坚决清除钻到社内的地主、富农分子，纯洁社的组织；提高警惕，严防地主和富农分子的破坏，保证互助合作运动的健康发展。
