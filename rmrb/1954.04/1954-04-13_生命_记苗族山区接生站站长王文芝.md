    Life
    ——A Record of Wang Wenzhi, Head of the Maternity Station in a Miao Mountain Area
    By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
    In Yueping Township, Kaili, nestled in the Miao Mountains, a remarkable and joyous event is being celebrated among the Miao people: in December of 1953, all eighty-eight infants born in the township survived. People say, "In the past, we only saw mothers carrying their bellies, but not children walking." Of ten births, at most five or six would live. Such a thing as every birth resulting in a living child has never happened before. This change in our lives is all thanks to the People's Government and our maternity station head, Wang Wenzhi!
    One day, Wang Wenzhi had just returned to Tangzhai Village and was immediately surrounded by a large group of Miao women wearing hairpins, white pleated skirts, and carrying children on their backs. Before she could even take off the medical kit hanging on her body, she hurriedly took the children from their hands, kissing one, teasing another, like a mother who had been separated from her children for a long time, affectionately caressing the infants before her. When asked if these were "her children," she paused and smiled thoughtfully:
    "How should I say it? If I say they are, they are really not mine. If I say they are not, I truly love them and care for them as if they were my own children. If I don't see them for a few days, I miss them. Look, that woman over there just asked me to be her son's godmother, didn't she? You've already seen her son, with his small nose, big eyes, and round, rosy face. When he smiles, he looks like a spring peach blossom, so adorable! But remembering when this child was born still makes my heart pound!"
    At that time, the promotion of new midwifery methods had just begun here, and the masses did not yet believe in them. One day, Wang Wenzhi was walking home from the Kaili Health Clinic of the Miao Autonomous Region in Lushan County. Just as she reached the halfway point of the mountain, the weather suddenly changed, followed by a gust of wind, and rain mixed with snow began to fall rapidly. Wang Wenzhi bent over, braving the wind and rain, grabbing the branches of trees on the roadside, stumbling and struggling upwards. As she was walking, she suddenly met Yang Baoyuan. Seeing his panicked expression, she quickly stopped him and asked, "Where are you going in such heavy rain?" He smiled, but didn't speak. When she asked again, he stammered, "N-nothing… I have to go to…" He didn't finish speaking and walked down the mountain. Wang Wenzhi thought, "Something must have happened at his house. That's right, a month ago, when I set off for Kaili to receive midwifery training, wasn't his wife already heavily pregnant? He must be going to ask the old midwife now." At the thought of the old midwife, her heart felt as if it were being cut with a knife and pierced with needles, and she couldn't help but tremble all over. Her two children had been killed by the old midwife using old methods of rough pulling and dragging. For the sake of her children's deaths, she didn't know how many times she had cried and how many tears she had shed, but what could she do? That was the old society! But could she allow mothers to continue to suffer the pain she had already suffered? No, she couldn't. The Party and the People's Government, in order to help alleviate the suffering of ethnic minority women during childbirth, had opened midwifery training classes, educating her to learn new midwifery methods, so that she could serve the lives of the children! If this child were to suffer any mishap at the hands of the old midwife today, how could she face the Miao sisters? Thinking of this, she walked faster and faster, and arrived after covering thirty li of mountain road, just as it was getting dark.
    As soon as Wang Wenzhi returned to the village, she immediately washed her hands, and without even taking the time to eat dinner, she went to Yang's house and said to the expectant mother's mother-in-law, "Grandma Yang, let me deliver your daughter-in-law's baby!" Grandma Yang was unwilling. She first lied and said that her daughter-in-law had a headache, not a stomachache, and then said, "Our ancestors have always followed this custom, and people are still living! What new method or old method, I don't believe it!" She turned around and went into the house. Wang Wenzhi immediately followed Grandma Yang inside. She saw the expectant mother leaning against a stool, sitting on the ashes on the ground, biting a lock of her hair, moaning and groaning as she rolled back and forth in pain. As she was about to bend down to help the expectant mother onto the bed, Grandma Yang pushed her away, saying, "Get out! Get out! You don't need to interfere. If you're so capable, how come your two children are not alive?"
    "Hearing these words, I felt very sad," Wang Wenzhi said, lowering her head sorrowfully. "Yes, if my children were still alive, wouldn't they be running around everywhere by now! But I still patiently explained the benefits of the new midwifery method to her, and used the painful fact of my own children's deaths to explain the dangers of the old midwifery method to her. As she was speaking, the courtyard door 'thumped' open, and an old midwife came in. Without saying a word, she grabbed the expectant mother's hair and shook it upwards, and then put her foot on the expectant mother's stomach and pressed down hard. In order to make her vomit, she also put duck feathers dipped in tung oil into the expectant mother's throat, and then ordered someone to bring a broken piece of pottery… I hurriedly stopped her: 'You're hurting people again, this can't be done!' She glared at me fiercely, stamped her feet, and lifted her skirt, threatening Grandma Yang: 'Did you hire me, or her? If she's here, I won't take care of it!'"
    "By the time I was pushed out of the door, it was already midnight. It was raining, and it was very cold, but I was covered in hot sweat. Should I leave, or shouldn't I? I was struggling inside. At this moment, I suddenly remembered what the director of the Kaili Health Clinic had said, he said: 'To carry out maternal and child health work, you must have a spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, your task is to overcome difficulties and protect the children.' Yes, if I have the determination to serve the masses, am I still afraid of suffering this little grievance? For the sake of the children, for the sake of the mothers, I must persevere in my work. Just then, the daughter-in-law's husband, Yang Baoyuan, came out. I asked him how it was, and he sighed and shook his head. It turned out that the expectant mother had suffered so much torment and lost so much blood that she had already fainted. The old midwife saw that the situation was dangerous and quietly told his mother to tell him to come out and prepare for the funeral. Hearing this, I asked him: 'Yang Baoyuan, do you believe in the Communist Party and the People's Government?' He said: 'The Communist Party and the People's Government divided the land and distributed cattle to our Miao people. What we didn't have in the past, we have now. If I don't believe in the Party and the People's Government, who else should I believe in?' I said: 'Then why don't you believe in the new midwifery method promoted by the People's Government? You have been looking forward to having a baby every day, and now that you are about to hold one in your arms, are you willing to let others harm it to death?' As soon as I said this, he suddenly grabbed my hand: 'Do you think there is still hope?' I said: 'Come on, let me go see,' he immediately pulled me into the house."
    "In the past, when our Miao women gave birth, they could only be alone in the house, and outsiders were not allowed to even take a look, for fear of ghosts. They also said that she was an unclean person, and was not allowed to use other people's bowls and chopsticks, nor was anyone allowed to take care of her nearby, and she was locked in a small room all day, letting her take care of the postpartum matters herself."
    "When I went in again, I quickly woke up the expectant mother, and told the family how to pay attention to the expectant mother's hygiene, and carefully guarded the expectant mother according to the new methods I had learned. At cockcrow, the child was born. But because the labor was too long, 'pseudothanasia' occurred, and his family thought he was dead and were very sad. I immediately picked up the baby by the legs, head down, and gently patted him on the back a few times, and used raw lard and disinfected cotton to rub his chest, and the child 'wailed' out. At this time, Grandma Yang was both surprised and delighted, and could not speak for a long time, wiping her tears and pulling me and saying: 'Wang Wenzhi, don't blame me for being so old-fashioned! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to hold my little grandson, and I'm afraid I wouldn't even have a daughter-in-law!'"
    This incident quickly spread like wildfire in the mountains. Later, when Wang Wenzhi went to the surrounding thirty or forty li to promote the new midwifery method, the women no longer hid from her, and the old people no longer complained about her talking about childbirth in front of everyone, and she became the most beloved person among the masses. No matter which village she went to, there was a large group of people surrounding her, either pregnant women calling for prenatal checkups, or children with headaches and fevers, wanting her to touch them. Sometimes, as soon as she delivered this family's child, that family would come to call again. Each time, no matter how late at night, whether it was wind or rain, she never delayed. With the help of the township People's Government, she also trained twenty midwives and established a maternity station. More than two hundred children were delivered safely by them. For these reasons, the masses elected her as a model of Miao health in Guizhou Province.
    "In addition to delivering babies, I also travel over mountains and ridges, going deep into the homes of the masses, helping mothers protect the health of their children. I treat minor illnesses, and for serious illnesses, I go to ask doctors for them. Once, Yang Xitang's child in Mixi Lower Village contracted pneumonia, but he didn't believe in medicine, but instead killed dogs and ducks, and invited 'ghost masters' to dance ghosts, which resulted in delaying the illness even more. When I went to visit him over the mountains, the child was already burning deliriously, and his eyes were wide open. The child's parents thought that the child was beyond saving and were about to throw the child out. I felt the child's chest, and his heart was still beating, so I told Yang Xitang to quickly ask a doctor, he said: 'Even the gods can't cure it, relying on doctors is even more useless.' I said: 'There is no disease that can't be cured by taking medicine, the health clinic cures so many patients every day!' But he still didn't listen. At this time, it was getting dark, and I thought: 'Life is important, if he doesn't go, I will go!' I immediately asked the women's director Wu Shinü to accompany me, and we ran thirty li to ask a doctor. On the way, the weather seemed to be deliberately against us, and it started pouring rain, and mountain torrents broke out in the ravines. When the two of us stumbled and crawled there, we unfortunately encountered the doctor treating an emergency illness for someone, and he couldn't come. We had no choice but to bring back a few packets of medicine. As soon as the child took it, it immediately took effect. When the child's mother saw that the condition had improved, there were tears in her eyes, but a smile on her face: 'Wang Wenzhi, you saved my child.' I said: 'You should thank Chairman Mao, it was he who sent doctors and good medicine to our Miao people.' Because the child had not yet recovered from the danger, that night, I persuaded the child's parents to carry lanterns and hold the child with me, and we rushed to the National Health Clinic at dawn to get an injection, and soon the illness was cured. Later, whenever I met Yang Xitang, I would joke with him and ask him: 'Is the child obedient? Do you want to call the ghost master again?' He would wave his hand and say: 'Oh! I stopped believing in that kind of people eight lifetimes ago.' Look, how fast life has changed! Even the most superstitious people now believe in medicine and believe in science!"
    After Wang Wenzhi finished speaking, she brushed the hair hanging on her forehead with her hand, and smiled softly after a moment of silence. At this time, it was already late at night, and a few people holding torches suddenly came in, saying that a pregnant woman was about to give birth in a village more than ten li away. With the torches illuminating the road, they quickly disappeared into the darkness of the valley.

    生命
    ——记苗族山区接生站站长王文芝
    本报记者　纪希晨
    在苗岭山中的凯里悦平乡里，有一件奇闻似的喜事，被苗族人民传颂着：在一九五三年十二月，全乡诞生的八十八个婴儿，全都活着。人们说：从前我们这里是“只见娘怀肚，不见儿走路”，生十个顶多能活五、六个，像现在这样生一个活一个的事，从未有过。生活里的这种变化，全靠着人民政府和我们的接生站站长王文芝啊！
    这天，王文芝刚刚回到堂寨村，马上便被一大群头戴簪，身穿白褶裙，背上背着孩子的苗族妇女围住了，她自己还未解下挂在身上的卫生包，就连忙从人们手中接过孩子，亲亲这个，逗逗那个，像和孩子久别重逢的母亲，深情地抚爱着跟前的婴儿。当问到这是不是“她的孩子”时，她沉思地微笑起来：
    “这该怎么说呢？说是吧，他们实在不是我的，说不是吧，可我真把他们当作是自己孩子那样爱他们，疼他们，隔几天不见就想他们。你看，刚才那位妇女，不是还在要我做她儿子的干妈吗？他儿子你已经见过了，小鼻子、大眼睛、红通通的圆脸孔，笑起来就像朵春桃花，真逗人喜爱哩！可是想起这孩子出生那阵，现在还叫我心惊肉跳呀！”
    那时候，这里刚刚推广新法接生，群众都还不相信。有一天，王文芝从炉山县苗族自治区凯里卫生所往家走，刚上到半山腰，天忽然变了，紧接一阵狂风，雨夹着雪，唰唰下开啦，王文芝弯着腰，顶住风雨，抓住路边树枝，跌跌撞撞往上爬。正走着，猛碰见杨宝元，她见他神色慌慌张张的，便连忙喊住他：“下这么大雨你往哪里去呀？”他笑了笑，可是不说话，当再问时，他吞吞吐吐说：“没……没有啥……我得到……”没说完就朝山下走了。王文芝想：“他家一定是出了什么事啦。对了，一个月前，当我动身到凯里受接生训练的时候，他的媳妇不是已经肚子大了吗？现在他准是去请旧产婆去了。”一想到旧产婆，她心上就如同刀剜针扎，不由得浑身哆嗦了一下；她的两个孩子，就是给旧产婆用旧法死扯活拉弄死的啊。为着孩子死了，她不知哭过多少回，流过多少泪，但有什么办法呢，那是旧社会啊！可是现在还能让母亲们继续遭受她已经受过的痛苦吗？不，不能，党和人民政府为了帮助解除少数民族妇女生育的痛苦，开办了接生训练班，教育她学会新法接生，就是要她去为孩子们的生命服务呀！这个孩子，今天叫旧产婆再弄个三长两短，她怎对得起苗家姊妹们？想到这里，她越走越快，三十里山路，天刚黑就到了。
    王文芝一回到村里，连忙洗了手，连夜饭也没顾上吃，便走到杨家去和产妇的婆婆说：“杨大妈，我来给你媳妇接生吧！”杨大妈不愿意，她先骗她说她的媳妇是脑壳痛，不是肚痛，接着又说：“我们老辈子就兴这规矩，人还不是活着！什么新法不新法，我才不信哩！”转过身进屋了。她立即跟着杨大妈走了进去。只见产妇靠着凳子，坐在地上的柴灰上，嘴里咬着一绺头发，痛得滚过来、翻过去地叫唤着。她正要弯腰去扶产妇上床时，不防杨大妈一把将她推开：“走开！走开！你用不着管。你有本事，你那两个孩子怎么还不活着？”
    “听到这话，我心里十分难过。”王文芝低下头，沉痛地说：“是呀，我孩子现在要是还活着，不也早会满地跑了吗！可是，我仍耐心向她宣传新法接生的好处，以我自己孩子死了的痛苦事实，向她说明旧法接生的危险。正说着，院门‘咚隆’一响，一个旧产婆进来了。她不由分说，抓起产妇头发就往上抖擞，又拿脚蹬在产妇肚上，使劲往下压，为了使她呕吐，她还把蘸着桐油的鸭毛探到产妇喉腔里，接着又吩咐叫拿破碗片子……我急忙挡住她：‘你又害人了，这可不行呀！’她狠狠瞪了我两眼，跺着脚，撩着裙子，威胁杨大妈说：‘你家请的是我，还是她？她要在这里，我就不管啦！’
    “当我被推到门外的时候，已经半夜了。雨在下着，天很冷，可是我满身都是热汗。离开呢还是不离开呢？我内心斗争着。这时，忽然想起凯里卫生所所长的话了，他说：‘开展妇婴卫生工作，要有不怕困难的精神，你们的任务就是：克服困难，去保护孩子们。’是呀，既有为群众服务的决心还怕受这点委屈吗？为了孩子，为了母亲，我要坚持工作。正在这时，媳妇的丈夫杨宝元出来了，我问他怎样，他唉声叹气地直摇头。原来产妇因为受了许多磨折，流了许多血，已经昏迷了过去；旧产婆看到情况危险，悄悄告诉他母亲要他出来准备后事了。听到这话，我问他：‘杨宝元，你相不相信共产党和人民政府呀？’他说：‘共产党和人民政府给我们苗家分了地，分了牛，过去没有的，现在全有了，不相信党和人民政府，我还相信谁？’我说：‘那你为啥还不相信人民政府提倡的新法接生呀？你过去天天盼娃娃，眼看抱到手啦，你忍心叫别人给害死吗？’我这么一说，他突然拉着我手：
  ‘你看还有救没救？’我说：‘走，我看看去，’他马上就把我拉进屋去了。
    “过去，我们苗家妇女分娩的时候，只能独自一个人在屋，外人连看都不许看一眼，怕有鬼。还说她是个不干净的人，不准用人家的碗筷，也不准旁人在跟前照顾，整天把她关在小房中，让她自己料理产后的事情。
    “当我再次进去的时候，很快就救醒了产妇，又告诉家人怎样注意产妇卫生，按所学过的新方法，一直细心地守护着产妇。鸡叫时分，孩子生下来了。可是因为生产时间太长，发生‘假死症’，他家里人以为死了，心里很难过。我立刻将婴儿两脚掂起，头朝下，在背上轻轻拍了几下，又用生猪油和消毒棉花在胸脯上擦了擦，孩子‘哇’的一声哭出来了。这时候，杨大妈又惊又喜，半天说不出话，一边擦着泪，一边拉住我说：‘王文芝，你可别见怪我这老脑筋呀！不是你，我不光抱不上小孙孙，恐怕连媳妇也没有啦！’”
    这件事，很快像风一样在山里传开了。后来，当王文芝下乡到周围三四十里的地方宣传新法接生的时候，妇女们再不躲她了，老人们再也不抱怨她在众人跟前讲生孩子的事了，她变成群众最热爱的人啦。无论走到那个村寨，都有一大堆人围住她，不是孕妇叫给作产前检查，就是那个孩子头痛脑热，要她摸一摸。有时，刚把这家孩子接下来，那家便又来叫了。每一回，不管深更半夜，是风是雨，她从没耽误过。在乡人民政府帮助下，她还培养了二十个接生员，成立了接生站，经她们接生二百多个孩子，都很安全，因为这些缘故，群众把她选为贵州省苗族卫生模范。
    “我除了接生，还翻山越岭，深入到群众家中，帮助母亲们保护孩子的身体健康，小病我治了，重的就代他们去请医生。有一次，米西下寨杨西堂的孩子得了肺炎，可是他不相信医药，反杀狗、杀鸭，请来‘鬼师’跳鬼，结果把病耽误得更重了。当我翻山去探望的时候，小孩子已经烧得昏昏迷迷，眼珠也瞪起来了，孩子的父母以为孩子没了救，正要把孩子往外丢。我摸摸孩子胸膛，心还在跳，便叫杨西堂赶快请医生，他说：‘神仙还治不好，靠医生更不顶事。’我说：‘就没有吃药治不好的病，卫生所每天治好的病人不知有多少！’可是他还不听，这时，天也快黑了，我想：‘人命要紧，他不去，我去！’马上叫妇女主任吴士女和我作伴，跑三十里路请医生。半路上，天好像故意跟我们作对，下起了瓢泼大雨，山沟里也发下了山水。当我俩跌跌爬爬赶到那里，不巧正遇医生给人看急病，来不了，我们只好带上几包药回来了。孩子一吃，马上见效。孩子妈妈看见病情转好，她眼里还有泪，脸上却笑起来了：‘王文芝，你救了我的孩子。’我说：‘你要感谢毛主席，是他给我们苗家派来医生，送来好药了。’因为孩子还没脱离危险，当天夜里，我又说服孩子父母，和我一同提着马灯，抱着孩子，天亮赶到民族卫生所打了针，不久病就好了。以后，每逢碰到杨西堂，我就和他开玩笑问他：
  ‘孩子乖不乖？要不要再叫鬼师来？’他就摆着手说：‘哎呀！我早八辈子就不再信那号人了。’你看，生活变得多么快啊！连最迷信的人，现在也相信医药、相信科学了！”
    王文芝讲完以后，用手掠了掠垂在前额上的头发，沉默了一会，轻轻地笑了起来。这时，夜已深了，几个燃着火把的人，突然进来了，说在十多里外的村庄里，一个孕妇快临产了。用火把照着路，他们很快消失在山谷里的黑暗中了。
