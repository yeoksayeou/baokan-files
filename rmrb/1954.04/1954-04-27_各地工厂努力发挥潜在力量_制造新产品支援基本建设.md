    Factories in Various Locations Strive to Unleash Potential
    Manufacturing New Products to Support Infrastructure Construction

    [Our Newspaper News] Existing industrial enterprises in various locations are working hard to improve their technical level, unleash their potential, and actively support infrastructure construction.

    In the first half of this year, Shanghai's industrial production departments averaged a monthly production of 700 to 1,000 tons of equipment and materials to support coal mine construction throughout the country. The Shanghai electrical machinery industry supplied nearly three times more cable to coal mines in the first quarter of this year than the average quarterly amount last year. State-owned Shanghai Wire Factory and the joint state-private Huatong Switch Factory are rushing to produce various electrical equipment such as cables and switches for the Angang Thin Plate Factory, and some of the products have already begun to be shipped to the construction site. The state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory and the joint state-private China Textile Machinery Factory have both increased their production plans significantly this year. The first batch of textile machinery is about to be sent to new textile factories in Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Jiangxi and other places.

    In the first quarter of this year, state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Tianjin manufactured many kinds of new products to support construction in various locations. Various specifications of flat steel produced by Tianjin Steel Plant have begun to supply the needs of steel bridge construction projects in various places. Tianjin No. 1 and No. 3 Machine Factories collaborated to produce a combined four-purpose shearing and punching machine to supply important construction units such as the Yangquan Mining Bureau. The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory formally produced the ply twisting machine in the first quarter, and the finished product will be available in the second quarter; the trial production of another new product - a single-process three-way roving frame - has also begun. To meet the needs of national transportation development, Tianjin Rubber Factory No. 2 increased and improved a small amount of production equipment, and exerted the huge potential within the enterprise. The daily output of automobile tires in April was significantly higher than in the first quarter.

    Shenyang's machinery manufacturing industry has trial-produced and manufactured many new products to support national construction. China's first 7,000-kilowatt water turbine has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory.

    Some local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Wuhan are adopting methods such as balancing equipment and adjusting organizations to further unleash the potential of existing enterprise equipment and support infrastructure construction. The thirteen local state-owned brick, tile, stone and lime factories in the Wuhan area, which were previously operated in a decentralized manner, have been centrally and uniformly led by the Municipal People's Government Industry Bureau, and adjusted and merged. In this way, it is estimated that brick production alone can be increased by more than 80% this year compared to last year.

    In addition, enterprises such as Baotou Machinery Factory and Hangzhou Universal Machinery Factory are also actively exerting their potential to meet the needs of infrastructure construction.

    各地工厂努力发挥潜在力量
    制造新产品支援基本建设
    【本报讯】各地现有工业企业，正努力提高技术水平，发挥潜在力量，积极支援基本建设。
    今年上半年，上海工业生产部门平均每一个月都要制造七百到一千吨的设备和器材；支援全国煤矿建设。上海电机工业今年第一季度供应煤矿的电缆，比去年每季平均数差不多增加两倍。国营上海电线厂和公私合营华通开关厂等厂，正为鞍钢薄板厂赶制各种电缆、开关等电气设备，一部分产品已开始运往工地。国营上海第二纺织机械厂、公私合营中国纺织机器厂，今年生产计划都比去年提高了许多，第一批纺织机械就要送到武汉、郑州、江西等地的新建纺织厂去。
    天津国营和地方国营工厂，在今年第一季度中，制造了许多种新产品以支援各地建设。天津钢厂生产的各种规格的扁钢，已开始供应各地钢铁桥梁建筑工程需要。天津市第一、第三机器厂协作生产了四用联合剪冲机，以供应阳泉矿务局等重要建设单位。国营天津纺织机械厂在第一季度正式生产的合股机，第二季度将出成品；另一新产品——单程三道粗纱机的试制工作，也已开始。天津橡胶二厂适应国家发展交通运输的需要，增加和改进了少量的生产设备，发挥了企业内部巨大的潜在力量，四月份汽车外胎的日产量比第一季度显著提高。
    沈阳机械制造工业为支援国家建设，已试制和生产了不少新产品。我国第一台七千瓩水轮机，已在国营沈阳高压开关厂试制成功。
    武汉市有些地方国营和公私合营工厂，正采取平衡设备、调整组织等办法，进一步发挥现有企业设备的潜在力量，支援基本建设。武汉地区过去分散经营的十三个地方国营砖瓦、石料、炼灰工厂，已由市人民政府工业局集中统一领导，加以调整合并。这样，估计仅砖一项今年就可以比去年增产百分之八十以上。
    此外，包头机械厂、杭州通用机器厂等企业，为供应基本建设的需要，也积极发挥了潜在力量。
