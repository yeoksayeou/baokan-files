    Lead Cotton Farmers in Doing Good Cotton Seed Selection

    The agricultural production leadership departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments in most cotton-producing areas have recently conducted inspections of the cotton seed preparation situation among the masses and the cotton seed supply situation of the supply and marketing cooperatives. According to the inspection results, the quantity of cotton seeds is already close to the needed amount, but the quality is much lower than in previous years.

    The main reasons for the poor quality of cotton seeds in various places this year are that last autumn was too dry in the south and there was continuous rain in the north, and cotton plants in most areas did not develop well, which affected the maturation of cotton seeds. Last year, the red bollworm infestation in various cotton-growing areas across the country was more serious than in previous years, and the proportion of insect-damaged seeds also increased. Secondly, because the habit of field seed selection among the masses is not yet widespread, and the agricultural production leadership departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments in many areas initially overestimated the seed selection situation among the masses and did not pay enough attention to the cotton seed supply work, preparing fewer seeds; some cotton seeds centrally stored by individual supply and marketing cooperatives, farms, agricultural production cooperatives, etc., deteriorated and rotted due to poor storage work. This cannot but reduce the quality of cotton seeds.

    This year's cotton planting task is very heavy, and the planting period is coming soon. In order to ensure the completion of this year's cotton production increase task, the Party committees and government organs, as well as supply and marketing cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas, must pay attention to improving the quality of cotton seeds and regard it as one of the important tasks in the current cotton planting work. At present, the effective way to improve the quality of cotton seeds is to mobilize the masses to do a good job in cotton seed selection. Experience has proven that there are many benefits to selecting cotton seeds by grain. In 1950, in the cotton seed breeding area of ​​Hebei Province, more than 80% of cotton farmers carried out seed selection. The cotton seeds selected by grain not only emerge quickly and strongly, are easy to preserve seedlings, but also develop more uniformly than those not selected by grain.

    In order to mobilize the masses to carry out cotton seed selection, it is necessary to use various facts to illustrate the benefits of selecting cotton seeds by grain, and specifically tell the masses how to distinguish the quality of cotton seeds from the shape and color of the cotton seeds, as well as how to pick out broken, insect-damaged, immature, and thin seeds, and save the usable cotton seeds. In areas where the masses already have the habit of seed selection, attention should be paid to checking and promoting seed selection work; in areas where the masses do not have the habit of seed selection, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and introduce and promote typical experiences of seed selection. There should be no rigid regulations on the degree of fineness of grain selection; in order to prevent unexpected disasters and the need to replant missing seedlings, the quantity of grain selection should be slightly surplus. Grain-selecting cotton seeds seems like a relatively troublesome task, but as long as the masses are truly mobilized and the masses truly understand the benefits of grain-selecting cotton seeds, the masses will automatically do it, and semi-labor women, children, and the elderly can be used to do it. In 1951, only a few farmers in Shitoumiaozi Village, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, grain-selected cotton seeds. In 1952, because the masses saw the benefits of grain selection, most farmers did it.

    In order to facilitate the masses to carry out grain selection as soon as possible, cadres in various cotton-producing areas should organize farmers who lack seeds to buy seeds quickly; supply and marketing cooperatives should strengthen coordination and promotion work in order to issue cotton seeds to farmers early. Cotton seeds that have already been selected by grain should still be carefully stored; especially in areas with more rain and snow or high humidity in winter, more attention should be paid to turning and drying cotton seeds and frequent inspections to avoid mold and loss of selected cotton seeds.

### 领导棉农做好棉种粒选工作

    领导棉农做好棉种粒选工作
    多数产棉区的农业生产领导部门和供销合作部门，对群众准备棉种的情况和供销合作社供应棉种的情况，最近都进行了检查。从检查的结果来看，棉籽数量已经接近需要，但质量却比往年降低很多。
    今年各地棉种质量较差的原因，主要是去年秋季南方过于干旱，北方阴雨连绵，大部地区棉株发育不良，影响了棉籽的成熟。去年全国各棉区红铃虫为害比往年严重，虫蛀籽的比率也增多了。其次由于群众在田间选种的习惯还不够普遍，而许多地区的农业生产领导部门和供销合作社部门，最初对群众选种留棉种情况估计过高，对棉种的供应工作重视不够，准备的种籽较少；个别地区供销合作社、农场、农业生产合作社等集中保存的一些棉种，又因为保存工作做得不好，使部分棉种变质霉烂。这就不能不使棉种的质量降低。
    今年棉花播种的任务很大，播种期也很快就要来到了。为了保证完成今年的棉花增产任务，各产棉区的党委和政府机关以及供销合作社，必须注意提高棉种的质量，把它作为当前植棉工作中的重要工作之一。目前，提高棉种质量的有效办法，就是动员群众做好棉种的粒选工作。经验证明，粒选棉种的好处很多。一九五○年河北省的棉花良种繁殖区内，有百分之八十以上的种棉户进行了粒选。经过粒选的棉种不仅出苗迅速、健壮，容易保苗，而且比没有粒选的发育整齐。
    为了发动群众进行棉种粒选工作，必须用各种事实说明粒选棉种的好处，并具体告诉群众如何从棉籽的外形和颜色分辨出棉籽的好坏，以及把破碎的、虫蛀的、不成熟的瘦瘪的棉籽挑拣出去，把可用的棉籽保存下来的方法。在群众已有粒选习惯的地区，应注意检查并推动粒选工作；在群众没有粒选习惯的地区，需要广泛深入地进行宣传，介绍推广粒选的典型经验。对粒选的精粗程度不要作硬性规定；为了防备意外灾害和缺苗补种的需要，粒选数量，应稍有富余。粒选棉种看来好像是一件比较麻烦的工作，但是只要真正把群众动员起来了，使群众真正懂得了粒选棉种的好处，群众是会自动做起来的，而且可以利用半劳力妇女、儿童、老人来做。辽西省义县石头庙子村一九五一年只有几户农民粒选棉种，一九五二年因为群众看到了粒选的好处，大部分农民便都做起来了。
    为了便于群众及早进行粒选，各产棉区的干部应组织缺种农民赶快买种；供销合作社要加强调剂和推销工作，以便提早把棉种发到农民手里。已经经过粒选的棉种，仍要注意保管；尤其在冬季雨雪较多或湿度较大的地区，更要注意棉种翻晒，和经常进行检查，以免选留的棉种再遭霉烂损失。
