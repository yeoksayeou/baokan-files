What Role Does Syngman Rhee Play?
		Wu Quan

For two months, the Syngman Rhee clique, which has been clamoring to "boycott" the Geneva Conference, has sent a delegation to participate in the Geneva Conference. What role does the United States want the Syngman Rhee clique to play at the Geneva Conference?

As soon as the Syngman Rhee delegation appeared, it arrogantly stated that they were not there for any consultation, but to complete a mission of sabotage. Before leaving Seoul, Byun Yung-tai, the head of the Syngman Rhee delegation and "Minister of Foreign Affairs," announced that he would insist on two absurd "main goals" at the Geneva Conference: 1. To "unify the entire Korea under the Republic of Korea"; 2. To oppose the withdrawal of the United Nations forces from South Korea. At the same time, he provocatively and arrogantly said that after implementing fascist rule throughout Korea in the future, they would also delineate a so-called "buffer zone" "north of the Yalu River." Another member of the delegation, Syngman Rhee's "Ambassador to the United States," You Chan Yang, followed by saying that if the Geneva Conference could not achieve Syngman Rhee's "goals" within ninety days, they would withdraw from the conference.

Therefore, everything is clear. A Reuters dispatch from Seoul on the 11th reported: "Western diplomats here believe that South Korea's attendance at the (Geneva) Conference is only to dramatically withdraw from the conference midway."

The Syngman Rhee clique's being cast in this new role was not done behind the scenes. Syngman Rhee bluntly said that the reason he decided to participate in the Geneva Conference was because he had received "very clear and encouraging" "guarantees" from Eisenhower. What were the "guarantees"? According to a report by the United Press on the 21st, these "guarantees" included precisely the content mentioned by Byun Yung-tai and You Chan Yang.

This is no longer a secret. This "guarantee" is already the third time. The first time was the "guarantee" put forward by the U.S. State Department in a statement issued on March 9 this year. The content is that an agreement reached between Dulles and Syngman Rhee last August is still "valid" for the Geneva Conference. This agreement stipulates that if Syngman Rhee fails to "unify" Korea according to the plan jointly proposed by the United States and Rhee within ninety days after the conference is held, "the two governments will then be prepared to withdraw from the conference." This "guarantee" is in fact a conspiracy between the United States and Syngman Rhee to sabotage the Geneva Conference. However, Syngman Rhee then asked the United States to give another "guarantee": after sabotaging the Geneva Conference, the United States would re-launch the war with him. On March 17, Dulles wrote a reply to Syngman Rhee's request. This letter greatly "encouraged" the Syngman Rhee clique, and they then demanded that the United States specifically "guarantee" to greatly expand its army in preparation for new adventures. Sure enough, this time Eisenhower added a "guarantee" of "specific military assistance."

A French Foreign Ministry spokesman stated after Dulles met with Bidault in Paris that France did not agree with any suggestions made by Dulles to pre-limit the duration of the Geneva Conference. According to a report in the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" on April 22, "Dulles has proposed that the initial duration of the Geneva Conference for the foreign ministers of the three major Western powers be two weeks." This proves that Dulles not only wanted to limit the time for the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue based on his agreement with Syngman Rhee, but also to impose the "deadline" on the entire process of the Geneva Conference.

At the same time, in a statement issued before leaving the United States, Dulles said that he wanted to "seek to establish a truly unified and independent Korea." What is "truly unified and independent"? The U.S. State Department explained in a document titled "Background Material on the Geneva Conference" that it is: "Korea freed from the Communist armies" and becoming a "unified and independent country," while the "Allied forces" maintain "strong forces and sufficient preparation" in Korea. This is precisely Syngman Rhee's plan to "unify" Korea.

In order to attempt to sabotage the Geneva Conference and instruct Syngman Rhee to carry out risky plans, the United States has appointed Dean, who sabotaged the Panmunjom talks, as "Dulles' special representative" to be stationed in Seoul for a long time to "directly discuss matters related to the Geneva Conference" with Syngman Rhee. At the same time, Van Fleet, the former commander of the U.S. invasion of Korea's Eighth Army—the most ardent advocate of the policy of "using Asians to fight Asians"—was sent to South Korea to expand the Syngman Rhee army. According to U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, Van Fleet's mission is to solve two specific problems with Hull and Syngman Rhee: 1. The issue of "expanding" the "size and composition" of Syngman Rhee's "active armed forces"; 2. To formulate a "U.S.-South Korea joint plan" to establish a Syngman Rhee "reserve army." The Syngman Rhee clique immediately held a military meeting to study the "new look of U.S. military assistance" and discussed the expansion plan. Syngman Rhee's "official spokesperson," Ge Hongji, said: "We have no doubt that the result will be to expand our army, navy, and air force as we have requested."

It is precisely because of this that the U.S. propaganda machine is constantly spreading the atmosphere that the Geneva Conference will not be able to resolve the Korean issue, in an attempt to prevent Asian and world public opinion from paying attention to this conspiracy between the United States and Syngman Rhee. Can the United States' wishful thinking be realized "as desired"? Let the facts answer!

    李承晚充当什么角色
    吴全
    两个月来一直叫嚷“抵制”日内瓦会议的李承晚集团，已派出了一个代表团参加日内瓦会议。究竟美国要李承晚集团在日内瓦会议上充当什么角色呢？
    李承晚代表团一出场，就嚣张地表明：他们不是为了什么协商去的，而是为了完成破坏任务去的。李承晚代表团团长“外务部长官”卞荣泰在离开汉城之前，就宣布他在日内瓦会议上将坚持两个荒谬绝伦的“主要目标”：一、把整个朝鲜“统一在大韩民国之下”；二、反对联合国军从南朝鲜撤退。同时，他狂妄地进行挑衅说，将来在全朝鲜实行法西斯统治后，他们还要在“鸭绿江以北”划定什么“缓冲区”。这个代表团的另一分子、李承晚“驻美大使”梁祐灿跟着说，如果日内瓦会议在九十天内不能实现李承晚的“目标”，他们就要退出会议。
    因此，一切都是明明白白的。路透社汉城十一日电报道说：“这里的西方外交家认为，南朝鲜出席（日内瓦）会议，只是为了戏剧性地中途退出会议。”
    李承晚集团被扮演成这样一个新的角色，不是在幕后进行的。李承晚就直言不讳地说，他所以决定参加日内瓦会议，是因为他已得到了艾森豪威尔所作的“十分明白的和令人鼓舞的”“保证”。“保证”些什么呢？据合众社在二十一日透露，这些“保证”，正是包括了卞荣泰、梁祐灿所说的那些内容。
    这已不是什么秘密。这个“保证”已经是第三次了。第一次是美国国务院在今年三月九日发表的声明中提出的“保证”。其内容是：去年八月杜勒斯和李承晚所达成的一项协议，对日内瓦会议仍然“有效”，这个协议规定举行会议九十天后如果不能照美李共同提出的方案由李承晚“统一”朝鲜，“两国政府到那时将准备退出会议”。这个“保证”事实上就是美国和李承晚破坏日内瓦会议的共谋。但是，李承晚随即又向美国要求再作“保证”：在破坏了日内瓦会议以后，美国要和他一起重新发动战争。三月十七日，杜勒斯对李承晚这个要求写了回信，这封信使李承晚集团大为“鼓舞”，他们接着就要求美国具体地“保证”给它大大扩充军队，以准备进行新的冒险。果然，这回艾森豪威尔就增加了“具体的军事援助”的“保证”。
    法国外交部发言人在杜勒斯到巴黎和皮杜尔会谈后表示：法国不同意杜勒斯提出的事先限制日内瓦会议期限的任何建议。据美国“基督教科学箴言报”四月二十二日报道说：“杜勒斯已经提出西方三大国外长出席日内瓦会议的初步期限为两星期”。这就证明杜勒斯不仅要根据他和李承晚的协议，限制日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的时间，而且要把“期限”强加到整个日内瓦会议的过程了。
    同时，杜勒斯在离美前发表的一个声明中说，他要“谋求建立一个真正统一与独立的朝鲜”。什么才是“真正统一与独立”呢？美国国务院在一个名为“关于日内瓦会议的背景材料”的文件里作了解释，那就是：“朝鲜摆脱共产党军队”而成为“统一独立的国家”，而“盟军”则在朝鲜维持“雄厚的兵力和充足的准备”。这恰恰也就是李承晚“统一”朝鲜的方案。
    为了企图破坏日内瓦会议，指使李承晚进行冒险的计划，美国已指派了破坏板门店双方会谈的迪安，以“杜勒斯的特派代表”的名义，长驻汉城，和李承晚“就有关日内瓦会议事宜进行直接商谈”。同时又派了前美国侵朝军第八军军长范佛里特——鼓吹“以亚洲人打亚洲人”政策最激烈的人物，到南朝鲜去扩充李承晚军队。据美国国防部长威尔逊宣布，范佛里特的任务是和赫尔、李承晚解决两个具体问题：一、“扩展”李承晚“现役武装部队的规模和组成成分问题”；二、拟订一个“美韩联合计划”，建立一支李承晚“后备军”。李承晚集团立即举行军事会议，研究美国“军事援助的新面貌”，讨论了扩军计划。李承晚的“正式发言人”葛弘基说：“我们毫不怀疑，结果将如我们所要求的那样扩充我们的陆、海、空军。”
    正是因为这样，美国宣传机器正在不断散布什么日内瓦会议将不可能解决朝鲜问题的空气，企图使亚洲和世界各国舆论不去注视美国和李承晚的这种共谋。美国这种如意算盘能不能“如意”地实现呢？还是让事实来答复吧！
