Xinhua News Agency Report: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region victoriously completed its grassroots election work by late March. The vast majority of voters of various ethnic groups residing in the autonomous region, including Mongolians, Hans, Huis, Manchus, Koreans, Oroqens, Solons, and Yakuts, exercised their solemn right to vote. According to statistics from twelve purely pastoral banners in the region, although the areas are scattered and transportation is inconvenient, the number of herdsmen participating in the election still accounted for over 86% of the total number of voters.

The more than six million people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region demonstrated a surge of patriotic enthusiasm during the general election campaign. On the Hulunbuir grasslands, settled nomadic and relatively concentrated herdsmen decorated their Mongolian yurts in a solemn and beautiful manner for the election days. The herdsmen hung portraits of Chairman Mao and posted voter lists in these "frontier homes," where voters carried out enthusiastic election activities. In order to better support national construction, the herdsmen celebrated the general election by actively raising livestock. By the end of the election, the weight of livestock on the grasslands generally increased by about 13 to 20 catties. The Oroqen hunters living in the Dobukuer River basin in the Greater Khingan Mountains entrusted their representatives to convey their opinions to the Nutuk (district) representative conference, saying: "Please rest assured, representatives of the People's Congress and the People's Government! We will definitely do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention, and strengthen the country's economic construction."

During the days when the election was held, the herdsmen participating in the election rode their steeds, sat in the unique covered wagons on the grasslands, and dressed in new clothes to participate in the election. Many teenagers who were not old enough to vote voluntarily helped the herdsmen take care of the livestock. Some herdsmen in remote areas arrived near the polling place the day before the election to stay overnight, and in the early morning, they were the first to arrive at the polling place to exercise their democratic rights.

    内蒙古全区胜利完成基层选举
    据新华社讯：内蒙古全区到三月下旬已胜利完成了基层选举工作。居住在自治区内的蒙、汉、回、满、朝鲜、鄂伦春、索伦、雅库特等各族选民，绝大多数都行使了自己庄严的选举权利。据全区十二个纯牧业旗的统计，虽然地区分散，交通不便，参加选举的牧民仍占选民总数的百分之八十六以上。
    内蒙古自治区六百多万各族人民，在普选运动中表现了高涨的爱国主义热情。呼伦贝尔草原上定居游牧和居住比较集中的牧民们，在选举的日子里，把蒙古包装饰得庄严美丽。牧民们在这些“塞外之家”挂起了毛主席像，张贴了选民榜，选民们在这里进行着热烈的选举活动。为了更好地支援祖国建设，牧民们都用积极饲养牲畜来庆祝普选。选举结束时，草原上各牧场牲畜的体重一般都增加了十三斤到二十斤左右。居住在大兴安岭森林中多布库尔河流域的鄂伦春族猎民，托自己的代表向努图克（区）代表大会传达他们的意见说：“请人民代表大会的各位代表和人民政府放心吧！我们一定搞好护林防火工作，加强国家的经济建设。”
    在进行选举的那几天，参加选举的牧民骑上骏马，坐上草地上特有的棚车，穿戴一新去参加选举。许多不够选举年龄的少年，主动帮助牧民看管牲畜。有些边远地带的牧民，在选举前一天便赶到选举会场附近住下来，清早，他们最先到了会场，行使了自己的民主权利。
