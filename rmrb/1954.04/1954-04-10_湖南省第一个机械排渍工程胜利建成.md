    Hunan Province's First Mechanical Drainage Project Successfully Completed

    Hunan Province's first mechanical drainage project has been successfully completed. This completely eliminates the threat of waterlogging for 9,200 mu of rice paddies in Lefu Polder, Yuanjiang County, increases the cultivated area by more than 6,200 mu, and is estimated to increase grain production by more than 6.2 million jin annually.

    Lefu Polder is located in a low-lying area and is prone to waterlogging disasters every rainy season. In order to help the farmers in this area eliminate waterlogging and increase grain production, and to create conditions for large-scale mechanical drainage in the Dongting Lake area in the future, the People's Government of Hunan Province decided to build a mechanical drainage project in Lefu Polder, Yuanjiang County. The main equipment for this project includes: installation of two 150-horsepower steam engines, eight water pumps, excavation of more than 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork for sub-dikes and canals, and construction of eleven civil engineering projects such as factory buildings, reservoirs, and intake canals. All of this mechanical equipment was manufactured by Chinese workers.

    After more than seventy days of intense labor by workers and laborers, the entire project was successfully completed on March 8th. Trial drainage began on the 11th, with good results. In six days, the Shuanglian Lake area, covering approximately 2,800 mu, drained 1.1 meters of water, exposing approximately 2,000 mu of arable land.

    The successful completion of the mechanical drainage project has greatly encouraged the mutual aid and cooperation and production enthusiasm of the farmers in Lefu Polder. Currently, sixteen mutual aid teams have been organized throughout the township, and many farmers are actively preparing to organize. Zhang Dongyang's mutual aid team plans to convert all of their original 52 mu of rice paddies to double-cropping rice, and the newly added 43 mu of rice paddies after mechanical drainage will be planted with single-cropping rice. The team plans to increase grain production by more than 42,700 jin this year. Currently, the farmers throughout the polder are actively plowing the rice paddies that have just been drained, preparing seedbeds, and carrying out production activities such as accumulating fertilizer.

    With the completion of the mechanical drainage project, the second state-owned farm in Yuanjiang County has also been established in Lefu Polder, and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also established a fish farm here. In order to fully utilize the power of the mechanical drainage project and reduce the drainage costs for farmers, plans are also underway to establish a large-scale electric rice mill.

    湖南省第一个机械排渍工程胜利建成
    湖南省第一个机械排渍工程已胜利建成。从此完全解除了沅江县乐福垸九千二百亩稻田的渍灾威胁，增加了耕地面积六千二百多亩，估计每年可增产粮食六百二十多万斤。
    乐福垸地势低洼，每逢雨季积水成灾。湖南省人民政府为了帮助这一带农民解除渍灾，增产粮食，并为洞庭湖区域将来开展大规模的机械排渍创造条件，决定在沅江县乐福垸修建机械排渍工程。这项工程的主要设备包括：安装一百五十匹马力的蒸汽机二台，水泵八台，开挖子堤、渠道等十万多土方工程，并建筑厂房、水池、进水渠等十一项土木工程。这些机械设备全部由我国工人制造。
    经过工人和民工七十多天的紧张劳动，全部工程已于三月八日胜利竣工。十一日开始试车排水，效果良好。六天时间，面积约二千八百多亩的双连湖，就排出了深达一点一公尺的水量，涸出耕地约二千亩左右。
    机械排渍工程的胜利完工，大大鼓舞了乐福垸农民互助合作和生产积极性，现在全乡已组织了十六个互助组，还有许多农民正在积极准备组织起来。张冬阳互助组准备把原有的五十二亩稻田全部改种双季稻，机械排渍后新增加的四十三亩稻田都种单季稻，今年全组计划增产粮食四万二千七百多斤。目前，全垸农民正积极耕犁刚排出渍水的稻田，整理秧田，并进行积肥等生产活动。
    随着机械排渍工程的建成，沅江县第二个国营农场也在乐福垸建立起来，湖南省农林厅也在这里建立一个育鱼场。为了充分利用机械排渍工程的动力、减轻农民的排渍用费的负担，还准备建立一个大规模的电机碾米厂。
