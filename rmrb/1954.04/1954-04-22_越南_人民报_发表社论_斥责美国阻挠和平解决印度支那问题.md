Xinhua News Agency, April 21st Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency on April 21st: The Vietnam Labor Party's official newspaper, "People's Daily," recently published an editorial. The editorial pointed out that the United States has now become the main obstacle to the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

The "People's Daily" wrote: "The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, at its recent enlarged meeting, adopted two important resolutions: supporting the convening of the Geneva Conference and launching a nationwide movement against American interference in the Indochina war of aggression."

The "People's Daily" then pointed out that the Berlin Conference's agreement to convene the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina was warmly welcomed and supported by the government, mass organizations, and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the US imperialists are not actively abiding by this agreement; on the contrary, they have been actively undermining this achievement of the Berlin Conference. The "People's Daily" pointed out that the US imperialists have intensified their interference in Indochina, threatening the French colonialists, preventing them from even talking about negotiations. US Secretary of State Dulles has repeatedly made speeches advocating the expansion of the Indochina war, clamoring for "united action." The United States has also rushed more weapons, aircraft, and pilots from domestic and Far Eastern US military bases to reinforce the French aggressor troops.

The "People's Daily" continued: "The above facts further prove that the US imperialists are afraid of peace and negotiations. They are putting pressure on the French colonialists, forcing them to continue compelling French youth to serve as cannon fodder in the Indochina war. They are trying their best to entice their vassal states to expand the Indochina war with them, exacerbating international tensions so that they can seize even greater profits. These facts also show that the French colonialists, while talking about peace, are actually obeying the orders of their American masters and dragging out the war of aggression. Therefore, it is quite clear that the US imperialists have become the main obstacle to the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue."

The "People's Daily" said: But the louder the US imperialists shout, the clearer their true colors as war-mongers are exposed. If the French colonialists allow the US imperialists to tie them tightly to the Indochina battlefield, they will certainly suffer even more disastrous defeats.

The "People's Daily" said: The Chinese people, as well as peace-loving people in Asia and other parts of the world, have condemned the American war-mongers. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, who have suffered countless hardships and pains caused by the US-French imperialists in the past eight years, are extremely indignant at the increasingly blatant interference of the United States.

    越南“人民报”发表社论
    斥责美国阻挠和平解决印度支那问题
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十一日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近一期发表一篇社论。社论指出：美国现在已成为阻挠印度支那问题和平解决的主要障碍。
    “人民报”写道：“越南国民联合战线全国委员会在最近的扩大会议上通过了两个重要的决议：拥护召开日内瓦会议并发动一个全国性的反对美国干预印度支那侵略战争的运动。”
   “人民报”接着指出，柏林会议关于召开日内瓦会议来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题及恢复印度支那和平问题的协议，得到越南民主共和国政府、群众团体和人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。但是美帝国主义者并不积极遵守这个协议，相反地，他们一直在积极破坏柏林会议这一成就。“人民报”指出，美帝国主义者在印度支那加紧了干涉，威胁法国殖民者，不让他们谈到谈判的问题。美国国务卿杜勒斯一再发表要扩大印度支那战争的演说，叫嚣采取“联合行动”。美国并从国内及远东的美国军事基地赶运了更多的武器、飞机和驾驶员去增援法国侵略军。
    “人民报”接着说：“上述事实进一步证明了美帝国主义者害怕和平和谈判。他们对法国殖民者施加压力，要他们继续强迫法国青年充当印度支那战争中的炮灰。他们在竭力设法引诱他们的附庸国家和他们一起扩大印度支那战争，加剧国际紧张局势，以便他们能攫取更大的利润。这些事实也说明，法国殖民者口里谈着和平，实际上却遵从他们的美国主子的命令，拖延侵略战争。因此，十分明显，美帝国主义者已经成了阻挠印度支那问题和平解决的主要障碍。”
    “人民报”说：但是，美帝国主义者叫嚷得声音越响，他们的战争贩子的本来面目就暴露得越清楚。如果法国殖民者让美帝国主义者把他们紧缚在印度支那战场上，他们一定会遭到更惨重的失败。
    “人民报”说：中国人民以及亚洲和世界其他地方的和平爱好者已经谴责美国战争贩子。在过去八年中身受美法帝国主义者所造成的数不尽的艰难痛苦的越南、高棉和寮国三国人民，对于美国越来越无耻的干涉感到非常愤慨。
