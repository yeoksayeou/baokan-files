Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS: The First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, A. A. Gromyko, received the Australian Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, B. K. Hill, on the 23rd and handed him a note from the Soviet government. The content of the note is as follows:

The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to make the following statement to the Government of Australia.

On April 3rd of this year, V.M. Petrov, the Third Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Australia, responsible for consular and commercial affairs of the embassy, did not return to the embassy after a business trip from Canberra to Sydney.

On April 7th, the Soviet Embassy requested the Australian Foreign Ministry to find Petrov. Despite repeated urging from the embassy, the Australian Foreign Ministry did not respond to this request from the embassy for almost a week.

Detailed audits related to Petrov's disappearance revealed that Petrov had committed a criminal offense by embezzling a large sum of public funds using forged signatures. The embassy verbally, and then in a note on April 21st, requested the Australian government to take measures to detain Petrov as a criminal and hand him over to the embassy. The Australian government has so far refused this request.

At the same time, the Australian authorities launched a widespread propaganda campaign slandering the Soviet Embassy in Australia and declared Petrov as a political refugee; the Australian authorities cited some so-called documents handed over by Petrov, which could only have been fabricated at the behest of those who are determined to worsen relations between the Soviet Union and Australia.

In addition, the Australian authorities have taken a number of measures aimed at further deteriorating relations with the Soviet Union and creating a situation in which the Soviet diplomatic mission in Australia cannot carry out its normal activities.

At this point, the Australian authorities arranged to kidnap Petrov's wife, who was about to return to the Soviet Union. It reached the point that on the eve of E.A. Petrova's (i.e., Petrov's wife) departure, Australian newspapers, especially the "Sunday Telegraph," published a message from which it could be seen that the Australian authorities were taking measures to forcibly detain Petrova in Australia.

On April 19th, Soviet Ambassador N.I. Generalov visited the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Australia, McBride, and, based on Australian newspaper reports, requested that appropriate measures be taken to prevent any attempts to obstruct Petrova's departure. The Ambassador said that if any action occurred during Petrova's departure that obstructed her normal departure from Australia, the Soviet government would consider such action as the forced detention of Soviet embassy personnel, for which the Australian government would bear full responsibility.

Despite this, on the evening of April 19th, when E.A. Petrova, Second Secretary of the Embassy V.V. Kislytsin, and two diplomatic couriers, V.N. Zherlkov and V.V. Karpinsky, were preparing to board a plane at Sydney Airport to leave Australia, a group of thugs, clearly selected, closely cooperating with Australian police personnel at the airport, attempted to forcibly detain Petrova and prevent her from boarding the plane. Australian authorities attacked A.G. Veslykh, First Secretary of the Embassy, his wife L.V. Veslykh, and Soviet citizens N.I. Antonova, Kislytsin, and the two Soviet diplomatic couriers who went to the airport to see off the above-mentioned Soviet citizens, and used violence against them. The Australian police present not only did not prohibit these arbitrary and illegal actions, and give the necessary protection to the Soviet diplomatic personnel, but one policeman also hit Embassy First Secretary Veslykh.

Because the conspiracy to kidnap Petrova in Sydney had failed, and the plane had flown to the Australian port of Darwin, the Australian police at that port took coercive measures aimed at detaining Petrova. When the plane landed in Darwin, the Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia, Leydin, had arrived at the airport with a team of Australian police. After the plane landed, Petrova, Kislytsin, and the two Soviet diplomatic couriers were ordered to leave the plane, after which they were immediately surrounded by police, who grabbed Petrova and took her away from the airport in a police car.

The Australian police, under the direction of the aforementioned Leydin, who arranged the kidnapping of Petrova, used violence against the Second Secretary of the Embassy, Kislytsin, and forcibly searched the Soviet diplomatic couriers using violence.

According to a number of public statements made by Australian Prime Minister Menzies and other official spokespersons of the Australian government, it can be seen that the action of kidnapping Petrova was pre-arranged by the Australian government, which had decided to forcibly detain Petrova. According to a Reuters correspondent in Canberra, Menzies pointed out in a statement on April 20th: "We have tried to arrange for representatives of our Foreign Ministry, security agencies, and other state agencies to be stationed at Mascot Airport (Sydney)... Before Mrs. Petrov (i.e., Petrova) left, the Chief Prosecutor, the Acting Foreign Minister, and I personally carefully considered the situation at the time..." According to Menzies' statement, it can be seen that a security agency operative was assigned to board the plane carrying Soviet Embassy personnel and Soviet diplomatic couriers, with the aim of persuading Petrova to stay in Australia. Menzies said: "I immediately ordered the head of the security agency to say that the pilot of the plane—on which we had already placed a person—should be in constant communication during the flight and should ask Mrs. Petrov... whether she was willing to stay in Australia."

According to a statement issued by Menzies on April 19th, relayed by a Reuters reporter from Sydney, the Australian government knew that Petrova did not intend to stay in Australia. Menzies said in the statement: "There is no evidence to prove that Mrs. Petrov left Sydney for reasons other than her own will."

In view of this, the Australian government took additional measures to forcibly detain Petrova in Darwin. Menzies declared on April 20th: "After careful prior consideration, we have sent security personnel to Darwin to meet the plane." The Australian Prime Minister (Menzies) pointed out that the government's orders were carried out by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, Leydin, and the security agency. In his statement on April 20th, he emphasized that when Petrova and the two diplomatic couriers disembarked in Darwin, they quickly separated Petrova from the two couriers as part of the plan. The Australian government launched a provocative propaganda campaign regarding the case of the criminal Petrov. The Australian authorities kidnapped Petrova, an employee of the Soviet Embassy in Australia, attacked Soviet diplomatic personnel and Soviet diplomatic couriers, and the Australian police forcibly searched diplomatic couriers. These are all extremely egregious violations of recognized norms of international law, which are unacceptable when normal diplomatic relations exist between two countries. For this reason, the Soviet government lodges a strong protest against the above-mentioned illegal actions. The Australian government bears full responsibility for these actions.

The Soviet government continues to insist that the Australian authorities immediately hand over the criminal Petrov to the Soviet government, return the kidnapped embassy employee Petrova, and severely punish those responsible for the aforementioned acts of violence.

The Soviet government believes that the Australian government's actions, which do not conform to the basic requirements of international relations, have created an atmosphere that not only makes it impossible for the Soviet Embassy to conduct normal diplomatic activities, but also endangers the personal safety of embassy personnel.

In light of what has happened, the Soviet government has decided to immediately recall the Soviet Ambassador to Australia and all personnel of the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet government also announces that, under these circumstances, it is no longer possible for the personnel of the Australian Embassy to remain in Moscow.

The Australian Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union said that he would immediately forward the above note to his government.

    苏联政府照会澳大利亚政府
    声明由于澳大利亚政府违犯国际法准则公然绑架苏联外交人员，决定立刻召回苏联驻澳使节
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部第一副部长安·阿·葛罗米柯二十三日接见澳大利亚驻苏联临时代办布·克·希尔，并将苏联政府的照会一件交给他。照会内容如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向澳大利亚政府作如下声明。
    今年四月三日苏联驻澳大利亚大使馆负责大使馆的领事和商业事务的三等秘书维·麦·彼得罗夫，因公从堪培拉前往悉尼以后，没有回大使馆去。
    四月七日，苏联大使馆要求澳大利亚外交部设法寻找彼得罗夫。尽管大使馆一再催促，澳大利亚外交部对大使馆这一要求，差不多有一个星期没有答复。
    从与彼得罗夫失踪有关的详细查账工作中发现，彼得罗夫用伪造签字骗取了一大笔公款，这样就犯了刑事罪。大使馆在口头上、随后又在四月二十一日的照会中要求澳大利亚政府采取措施，把彼得罗夫作为一个罪犯扣留起来并将他解交大使馆，澳大利亚政府迄今还未答应这个要求。
    同时，澳大利亚当局发动一个诽谤苏联驻澳大利亚大使馆的广泛的宣传，并把彼得罗夫宣布作为一个政治逃亡者；澳大利亚当局引述了一些所谓由彼得罗夫交出的文件，而这些文件只可能是在那些一心要使苏联和澳大利亚关系恶化的人的指使下伪造出来的。
    此外，澳大利亚当局已采取若干措施，这些措施的目的在于进一步恶化和苏联的关系和造成一种形势使苏联驻澳大利亚的外交使团不能从事正常活动。
    到这一地步，澳大利亚当局作了绑架要回苏联去的彼得罗夫的妻子的布置。事情到了这一程度：在埃·阿·彼得罗娃（即彼得罗夫的妻子）动身前夕，澳大利亚各报，特别是“星期日电讯报”，刊载了一则消息，从这一则消息是可以看得出澳大利亚当局是正在采取措施以强力把彼得罗娃拘留在澳大利亚的。
    四月十九日，苏联大使尼·伊·盖涅拉洛夫拜访澳大利亚外交部代理部长麦克布莱德，并根据澳大利亚报纸的消息要求采取适当措施来防止阻挠彼得罗娃离开的一切企图。大使说：如果在彼得罗娃离开时发生了阻挠她正常离开澳大利亚的任何行动，苏联政府将认为这样的行动是对苏联大使馆人员的强迫扣留，而澳大利亚政府对此应负全部责任。
    尽管这样，四月十九日晚，当埃·阿·彼得罗娃、大使馆二等秘书弗·维·基斯利钦和两个外交信使弗·纳·热尔科夫和维·维·卡尔平斯基在悉尼机场准备上飞机离开澳大利亚的时候，一批显然是挑选出来的打手，和机场上的澳大利亚警察人员密切配合，企图以强力来扣留彼得罗娃，并阻挠她上飞机。澳大利亚当局的人员攻击到机场去为上述苏联公民送行的大使馆一等秘书阿·格·维斯利赫、他的妻子鲁·维·维斯利赫和苏联公民纳·伊·安东诺娃、基斯利钦和两个苏联外交信使，并对他们使用暴力。在场的澳大利亚警察不但不禁止这些专横、非法的举动，给苏联外交人员以必要的保护，并且有一名警察还打了大使馆一等秘书维斯利赫。
    因为在悉尼绑架彼得罗娃的阴谋已经失败，而且飞机已经飞往澳大利亚的港口达尔文，该港口的澳大利亚警察就采取了目的在于扣留彼得罗娃的强迫手段。当飞机在达尔文降落的时候，澳大利亚北领土政府长官莱丁已经带了一队澳大利亚警察到了机场。在飞机降落以后，彼得罗娃、基斯利钦和两个苏联外交信使被命令离开飞机，在这以后他们立刻被警察包围，警察抓住了彼得罗娃，把她用一辆警察汽车从机场装走了。
    在上述的莱丁指导之下布置绑架彼得罗娃的澳大利亚警察，对大使馆的二等秘书基斯利钦使用暴力，并使用暴力强迫搜查苏联的外交信使。
    根据澳大利亚总理孟席斯和澳大利亚政府其他的官方发言人所发表的若干公开声明，可以看出：绑架彼得罗娃的行动是曾经决定强迫扣留彼得罗娃的澳大利亚政府预先作了部署的。据路透社驻堪培拉记者说：孟席斯在四月二十日的声明里曾经指出：“我们曾设法把我们外交部、保安机关与其他国家机关的代表布置在马斯科特机场（悉尼）……在彼得罗夫夫人（即彼得罗娃）离开以前，首席检察官、代理外交部长和我本人曾很仔细地考虑到当时的情况……”根据孟席斯的声明可以看出：保安机关的一个特务曾被指派搭上苏联大使馆人员和苏联外交信使所乘的那架飞机，目的是要劝诱彼得罗娃留在澳大利亚。孟席斯说：“我立刻命令保安机关的负责人说，飞机——在那上面我们已经事先安置了一个人——上面的驾驶员在飞行时应该随时通消息，并应向彼得罗夫夫人打听……她是否愿意留在澳大利亚。”
    根据路透社记者从悉尼转发的孟席斯在四月十九日发表的声明看来，澳大利亚政府是知道彼得罗娃并不打算留在澳大利亚的。孟席斯在声明里说：“没有证据可以证明彼得罗夫夫人离开悉尼是由于她本人意愿以外的其他原因的。”
    由于考虑到这一点，澳大利亚政府采取了另外的措施，以便在达尔文强迫扣留彼得罗娃。孟席斯在四月二十日宣称：“经过审慎的事先考虑以后，我们已经派有保安人员在达尔文迎接飞机。”澳大利亚总理（孟席斯）指出了政府的命令是由北领土政府长官莱丁和保安机关执行的，他在四月二十日的声明里强调说：当彼得罗娃和两个外交信使在达尔文下飞机时，他们很快就将彼得罗娃和两个信使分隔开，这是计划的一部分。澳大利亚政府对于罪犯彼得罗夫的案件发动了挑衅宣传，澳大利亚当局绑架了苏联驻澳大利亚大使馆的职员彼得罗娃，攻击了苏联外交人员和苏联外交信使，以及澳大利亚警察强迫搜查外交信使，这些都是极其恶劣地违犯了公认的国际法准则的行为，在两国间的正常外交关系存在的时候，这些都是不能容许的。为此，苏联政府对于上述的不法行动提出坚决的抗议。澳大利亚政府对于这种行动应负完全责任。
    苏联政府继续坚持：澳大利亚当局应立刻把罪犯彼得罗夫解交给苏联政府，把绑架去的大使馆职员彼得罗娃送还，并严惩犯有上述使用暴力的罪行的人员。
    苏联政府认为：澳大利亚政府这种不合乎国际关系基本要求的行动，制造了一种气氛，不仅使得苏联大使馆不能进行正常外交活动，并且危害大使馆人员的人身安全。
    根据已经发生的情况，苏联政府决定立刻召回苏联驻澳大利亚的大使和苏联大使馆的全体人员。苏联政府并宣布：在这种情况之下，澳大利亚大使馆的人员也不可能再在莫斯科停留。
    澳大利亚驻苏联代办说：他将立刻把上述照会转交给他的政府。
