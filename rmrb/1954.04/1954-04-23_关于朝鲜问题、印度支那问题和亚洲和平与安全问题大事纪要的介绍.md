The semi-monthly journal "World Knowledge" has published in its eighth issue a supplement containing three chronologies of events concerning the Korean question, the Indochina question, and the question of peace and security in Asia. The chronologies list major events from the end of World War II in 1945 to the present, illustrating the origin, course, and crux of these issues. The historical evidence provided by the chronologies leads all unbiased people to a common conclusion: the policy of aggression and expansion pursued and continued by the U.S. ruling clique since the post-war period, aimed at enslaving the Asian people, is the direct and fundamental cause of the unresolved Korean question, the unquenched flames of war in Indochina, and the widespread and severe threat to peace and security in Asia.

The "Chronology of Events Concerning the Korean Question" shows that since the end of the war against Japan in 1945, the efforts of the Korean people to establish a unified, independent, and democratic state have been consistently obstructed and undermined by the U.S. authorities. From the division of Korea, the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War, and the unprecedented suffering of the Korean people, one can see everywhere the ugly evidence of the U.S. policy of aggression and enslavement in Korea.

After the Soviet army liberated Korea in August 1945, the Soviet Union consistently pursued a policy of assisting the Korean people in establishing an independent and autonomous state on a democratic basis. At the insistence of the Soviet Union, the Moscow Conference of Soviet, American, and British Foreign Ministers held in the same year made an important resolution on establishing an independent state in Korea based on democratic principles. However, subsequent facts have proved that the U.S. authorities not only failed to comply with this resolution but implemented a policy diametrically opposed to it. The U.S. authorities refused to listen to the opinions of the Korean people and massively persecuted the democratic forces in South Korea, while stepping up the support of the reactionary and traitorous South Korean clique headed by Syngman Rhee as a tool for aggression and enslavement of the Korean people. Disregarding the common will of all Koreans, the U.S. authorities rejected the Soviet proposal for mutual withdrawal of troops and allowing the Korean people to organize their own government. Subsequently, they fabricated a fraudulent "election" in South Korea, which was resolutely opposed by the vast majority of Koreans, and imposed the reactionary and bloody rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime on the people of South Korea. At the same time, the U.S. authorities allocated large sums of money and weapons to accelerate the establishment of the Syngman Rhee puppet army. According to U.S. official announcements, on the eve of the outbreak of the Korean War, the Rhee puppet army, built by the U.S., already numbered 150,000.

At dawn on June 25, 1950, the U.S. and Rhee troops launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, igniting the flames of aggressive war. This was by no means an accidental event but a predetermined goal and inevitable result of the U.S. policy of dividing Korea and supporting the Syngman Rhee regime. U.S. officials had openly stated their intention to "remove" the 38th parallel and expand the puppet rule of Syngman Rhee to the entire Korean peninsula. In the period leading up to the outbreak of the war, the Syngman Rhee puppet regime constantly clamored that South Korea was ready and could launch an armed attack on North Korea at any time. Even the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" openly acknowledged this in its report to the United Nations General Assembly.

However, the reckless adventure of the U.S. aggressors suffered a tragic defeat. The Korean people were not intimidated by the slaughter, indiscriminate bombing, and other inhumane atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. invading forces on Korean soil. On the contrary, they grew stronger in battle and, with the heroic support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, inflicted devastating blows on the enemy. The U.S. ruling clique was forced to admit that the adventure in Korea had no "hope of victory" and therefore, after the Soviet Union's proposal, agreed to hold armistice negotiations. However, as the facts listed in the chronology show, the U.S. aggressors were still unwilling to give up and妄想妄想 to gain at the negotiating table what they could not achieve on the battlefield. During the protracted armistice negotiations, the U.S. side put forward various absurd and unreasonable demands, creating numerous obstacles to the negotiations, to delay and disrupt the negotiations. In the negotiations on the issue of prisoners of war, the U.S. side put forward the so-called principle of "voluntary repatriation," that is, the principle of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, which violated international law and humanitarian principles, and carried out large-scale massacres and persecutions of prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island and elsewhere, fabricating the lie that prisoners of war "refused repatriation." On this one issue alone, the U.S. side delayed the negotiations for a year and six months. While delaying the negotiations, the U.S. side systematically launched a genocidal bacteriological war against the Korean and Chinese people and attempted to rely on so-called "military pressure" to force concessions from the Korean and Chinese sides. But the U.S. plots were foiled one by one. Under the active efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides and the growing pressure of world opinion, the U.S. side finally had to accept the armistice. The armistice agreement signed at Panmunjom in Korea on July 27, 1953, marked the end of the Korean War, which lasted more than three years, with the defeat of the aggressors. The U.S. aggressors paid the price of nearly 400,000 troops and huge amounts of supplies, but did not change this already predetermined outcome.

After the Korean armistice, the U.S. authorities continued their consistent policy, attempting to maintain and deepen the instability of the Korean armistice and prevent the relaxation of international tensions caused by the Korean armistice. On the eve of the armistice, the U.S. side treacherously connived with Syngman Rhee to detain 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the pretext of "release"; after the armistice was achieved, the U.S. side used spies on a larger scale to threaten prisoners of war, undermine explanatory work, and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, preventing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from exercising its functions and depriving prisoners of war of their right to return to their homeland and live a peaceful life. These situations were fully confirmed by the documents and reports issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Disregarding the solemn protests of the Korean and Chinese sides and the condemnation of world opinion, the U.S. side went further to completely tear up the prisoner-of-war repatriation agreement, unilaterally stopped the explanatory work, and forcibly detained 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, handing them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to serve as cannon fodder. At the same time, the U.S. side vigorously obstructed and unilaterally suspended the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference, and vigorously obstructed the convening of the political conference. On the other hand, the U.S. side repeatedly violated the armistice agreement, shipping in large quantities of reinforcements and war materials to strengthen the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and constantly sending aircraft and military personnel to invade the Korean and Chinese regions. All these facts prove that the U.S. authorities are still continuing their provocative policy of maintaining and deepening tensions in Korea and have no intention of negotiating a peaceful solution to the Korean question, turning the unstable armistice into a lasting peace.

The "Chronology of Events Concerning the Indochina Question" records the heroic struggles of the Indochinese people to overthrow imperialist enslavement and oppression and strive for national liberation since the entry of Japanese troops into Indochina in 1940; it records the fact that the French government broke its word after World War II, launched a war, attacked the Indochinese people's own country it had recognized, and tried to restore its colonial rule over the Indochinese people. At the same time, this chronology also records the crimes of the U.S. government's active intervention in this colonial war. The U.S. attempted to maintain tensions in the Far East, turn Indochina into a military springboard for attacking China, and replace the collapsing French imperialism with U.S. imperialist rule, turning this rich region into a U.S. colony.

As everyone knows, the rich Indochina began to be nibbled away piece by piece by French colonists from the mid-19th century. By the 1890s, all three Indochinese countries had fallen into the hands of France. In 1940, Japanese imperialism, which had already launched a war of aggression against China, began to invade Indochina. The brutal French colonial authorities in Indochina surrendered ignominiously in the face of the Japanese fascist offensive. By March 9, 1945, Japan had formally occupied the whole of Indochina.

However, the people of the three Indochinese countries, with their long tradition of struggle, rose up and waged a heroic anti-Japanese struggle. The Vietnam Independence League (Viet Minh), formed in May 1941 by various Vietnamese parties and social organizations, organized people's armed forces, opened up liberated areas, and established political organs. It is universally recognized that the Viet Minh was the only anti-Japanese force in Vietnam. The French "Marseillaise" newspaper once said: "When French senior officials obediently acted as Petain elements, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, fought against Japanese fascism with rare courage."

On September 2, 1945, after Japan surrendered, Ho Chi Minh, chairman of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam elected by the National People's Congress of Vietnam, declared Vietnam's independence at a rally of 500,000 people in Hanoi. Then, on January 6, 1946, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a general election for the National Assembly, in which more than 90% of the voters participated. On March 3, the National Assembly elected the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh was elected president. A government of an independent country, produced through democratic and legal elections, was born. This country was recognized by the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, which have a population of more than 800 million. In the same year that Vietnam declared independence, the people of Laos and Cambodia also declared independence and organized their own regimes. The Cambodian Resistance Government (i.e., the Central People's Liberation Committee) elected by the Cambodian People's Congress and the Lao Resistance Government elected by the Free Lao People's Congress were also established in 1950.

However, the French colonists, harboring the purpose of restoring their colonial rule, climbed back onto the Indochinese peninsula with the British army. In order to accumulate strength and wait for an opportunity to attack, they held negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the negotiations, the Vietnamese government made repeated efforts and made various concessions in order to seek a peaceful solution. In 1946, it finally signed the "Preliminary Agreement," the "Staff Agreement," and the "Provisional Agreement" with the French side. In these agreements, France recognized that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is a free country with its government, congress, army, and finances" and should cease hostilities. Although the French side signed these agreements, it did not have the sincerity to fulfill its obligations. On the one hand, the French army actively prepared to launch a large-scale war, and on the other hand, it repeatedly provoked incidents in cities such as Haiphong and Hanoi. In November, the French army created a customs incident and took advantage of the incident to occupy Haiphong and Lang Son. In December, it attacked Mong Cai and Dinh Lap. On December 19, after the French army completed its preparations, it launched a general attack in Hanoi. At this time, the French side completely tore up its agreements and launched a large-scale war of aggression. In order to seek a peaceful solution, the Vietnamese side always adopted a tolerant attitude. From December 10 to late March of the following year, President Ho Chi Minh sent eight consecutive appeals to the French side, requesting the restoration of peace, but the French side never responded. Historical facts clearly show that the French government, supported by the United States and intending to restore imperialist rule in Indochina, was the culprit in provoking the Indochina War.

In order to save the motherland and defend independence, the Vietnamese people launched a nationwide resistance, giving the French colonists a severe blow. In seven years, more than 320,000 French colonial troops were annihilated. 180,000 French expeditionary troops were trapped in Indochina, losing the initiative and becoming "prisoners of the Indochinese rice paddies." Although the French side relied on U.S. aid, replaced six commanders-in-chief, and supported Bao Dai, Sisavang Vong, and Sihanouk as puppet kings of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia respectively to deceive the people, and organized puppet troops to participate in the war, all this could not reverse France's defeat.

U.S. imperialism took advantage of France's difficulties and gradually extended its clutches into Indochina. From 1950, especially after the Korean armistice, the U.S. intensified its intervention in Indochina. On June 27, 1950, U.S. President Truman, while announcing that he had ordered the U.S. Navy and Air Force to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, said that he had ordered the acceleration of military aid to the French puppet army and the dispatch of a military mission to Indochina. After this, large quantities of U.S. military materials were shipped to Indochina. From 1950 to the end of 1953, U.S. military aid materials exceeded 400,000 tons. The U.S. share of the Indochina war expenses gradually reached more than 70% of the total. The U.S. supplied aircraft and warships, and also sent U.S. aviators and technicians to participate in the war. U.S. generals such as Clark and O'Daniel, and U.S. politicians such as Dewey and Stevenson, traveled back and forth in Indochina in an endless stream. The U.S. made no secret of its demands to obtain the right to supervise military aid, to train the puppet army, and to grant the Bao Dai and other puppets "independence," which was actually to control them directly through the U.S. The U.S.'s ambition to turn Indochina from a French colony into its own colony and thereby turn it into a military springboard for attacking China has been completely exposed.

The people of the world demand the restoration of peace in Indochina. Since 1949, the world peace movement has repeatedly called for an end to the Indochina War. In November 1953, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again expressed the attitude of the Vietnamese people in advocating a negotiated peaceful solution. However, the United States forced France to continue the war. Some powerful figures in the French ruling group, under the pressure and instigation of the United States, still have not abandoned the idea of relying on the United States to continue the war. Why can't peace be restored in Indochina? Historical facts have shown that the responsibility lies with the United States.

The "Chronology of Events Concerning the Question of Peace and Security in Asia" shows that it is precisely because the U.S. ruling clique is pursuing a policy of aggression in Asia, wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of various countries, undermining the sovereignty of various countries, building military bases everywhere, implementing the policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," and disregarding the opposition of the people of Asian countries, reviving Japanese militarism, that the peace and security of the Asian people have been severely threatened again after the end of the war against Japan.

As everyone knows, as early as shortly after the end of the war against Japan, the United States stepped up its interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries, first of all in the internal affairs of China. The United States gave the Kuomintang reactionary government a large amount of military material aid, equipped and transported a large number of Kuomintang troops, enabling the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale civil war to attack the Chinese people. The "White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations" published by the U.S. State Department on August 5, 1949, exposed the U.S. conspiracy to completely turn China into a U.S. colony and military base. However, the Chinese people's liberation struggle "was beyond the control of the U.S. government," so this blatant interference was defeated. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the complete bankruptcy of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against China, the U.S. ruling clique regarded the People's China as a thorn in its side. The U.S. launched the Korean War, attempting to further attack China, and openly occupied China's territory Taiwan, turning it into a U.S. military base. At the same time, it took various other measures to antagonize the Chinese people, wantonly undermining the normal political and economic ties between Asian countries.

Reviving Japanese militarism is another sign of U.S. policy in Asia. The United States began this work shortly after Japan's surrender. From MacArthur's release of Japanese major war criminals on August 30, 1947, to the entire process of the U.S. unilaterally manufacturing the "Peace Treaty with Japan" in September 1951 and signing the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" on March 8, 1954, it shows that the U.S. openly violates its international obligations and international agreements, disregards the will of the vast Asian people, and systematically supports Japanese militarist forces, attempting to turn Japan into a base for the U.S. to launch aggression and a source of war that threatens peace and security in Asia.

The facts listed in the chronology also show that the United States uses various means to try to control the military, political, and economic affairs of Asian countries, turning them into U.S. military bases and using Asian people as cannon fodder for the U.S. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, the U.S. authorities bind the hands and feet of Asian countries through so-called "economic aid" and "military aid," through so-called "mediation" of disputes, and through signing various "treaties" and "agreements" with Asian countries that undermine the sovereignty and independence of these countries, and try their best to drag these countries into Southeast Asia and the Pacific military alliances that serve U.S. aggression and oppose other countries. It is very clear that this policy pursued by the U.S. is the root cause of the tense situation in Asia.

In contrast, China and the Soviet Union have always resolutely safeguarded peace and security in Asia. Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in his talk on June 28, 1950: "Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves, and should not be managed by the United States." The Chinese people fully support this principle and oppose the U.S. policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and creating wars in Asia. The people of China and the Soviet Union pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence with all countries and developing trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. China and the Soviet Union insist on opposing the revival of Japanese militarism. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stipulates that Japan's re-aggression will be jointly prevented and peace in the Far East will be maintained. The trade agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union and Asian countries and the various proposals put forward by the United Nations Organization fully prove the two countries' sincere desire to maintain and promote peace and develop economic ties between countries. These facts fully illustrate who is endangering peace and security in Asia and who is safeguarding peace and security in Asia. (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于朝鲜问题、印度支那问题和亚洲和平与安全问题大事纪要的介绍
    “世界知识”半月刊在第八期的附册中发表了关于朝鲜问题、印度支那问题和亚洲和平与安全问题的三项大事纪要。纪要列举出从一九四五年第二次世界大战结束以来到目前为止的有关大事说明了上述诸问题的产生、经过及其症结之所在。纪要所提供的历史的证据，使一切不为偏见所左右的人们不能不作出共同的结论：美国统治集团战后以来所推行并正在继续推行的以奴役亚洲人民为目的的侵略扩张政策，是朝鲜问题未能解决、印度支那的战火未能熄灭、亚洲和平与安全遭到普遍的严重威胁的直接的和根本的原因。
    “朝鲜问题大事纪要”表明，一九四五年对日战争结束以来，朝鲜人民建立统一、独立、民主的国家的努力，遭到美国当局的一贯的阻挠和破坏。从朝鲜陷于分裂状态以及随之而来的侵朝战争的爆发和朝鲜人民遭受的空前灾难中，人们到处可以看到美国侵略和奴役朝鲜的政策的丑恶罪证。
    一九四五年八月，苏军解放朝鲜以后，苏联始终不渝地奉行协助朝鲜人民在民主基础上建立独立自主的国家的政策。在苏联坚持下，同年举行的莫斯科苏、美、英三国外长会议作出了关于根据民主原则在朝鲜建立独立国家的重要决议。但是，在此以后的事实证明，美国当局不但不遵守这一决议，而且执行着与此截然相反的政策，美国当局一面拒绝倾听朝鲜人民的意见并大肆迫害南朝鲜的民主力量，一面加紧扶植以李承晚为首的南朝鲜反动卖国集团，作为侵略和奴役朝鲜人民的工具。美国当局不顾全朝鲜人民的共同意志，拒绝了苏联提出的双方撤军、让朝鲜人民自己组织政府的建议，接着在南朝鲜制造为绝大多数朝鲜人民所坚决反对的单独“选举”的骗局，把李承晚傀儡政权卖国的反动的血腥统治，强加在南朝鲜人民的身上。同时，美国当局还拨出大批金钱和武器，加紧建立李承晚傀儡军队。据美国官方宣布，在朝鲜战争爆发前夕，美国一手建立起来的李伪军已有十五万人。
    一九五○年六月二十五日拂晓，美李军队向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动进攻，由此而点燃侵略战火，这完全不是什么偶然的事件，而是美国所奉行的分裂朝鲜、扶植李承晚政权的政策的预定目标和必然的结果。美国官方曾经毫不掩饰地表示要
  “撤除”三十八度分界线，把李承晚的傀儡统治扩大到全朝鲜。在战争将要爆发的一个时期中，李承晚傀儡不断叫嚣南朝鲜已经准备停当，随时可以对北朝鲜发动武装进攻。甚至所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”在提交联合国大会的报告中也公开承认这一点。
    但是，美国侵略者的疯狂冒险遭到了悲惨的失败。朝鲜人民不但没有为美国侵略军在朝鲜土地上所施行的屠杀、滥炸以及其他种种惨无人道的暴行所吓倒，反而愈战愈强，并在中国人民志愿军兄弟般的英勇支援下连续给敌人以毁灭性的打击。美国统治集团被迫承认在朝鲜的冒险毫无“胜利的希望”，因此不得不在苏联倡议之后，同意举行停战谈判。但是，如纪要列举的事实所表明，美国侵略者心犹未甘，妄想在谈判桌上取得它在战场上得不到的东西。在旷日持久的停战谈判中，美方提出种种荒谬无理的主张为谈判制造重重障碍，以达到拖延和破坏谈判的目的。美方在战俘问题的谈判中提出违反国际法和人道原则的所谓“自愿遣返”亦即强迫扣留战俘的原则，并在巨济岛等地战俘营中大规模屠杀迫害战俘，制造所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”的骗局。仅仅在这一个问题上，美方就使谈判拖延了一年零六个月。美方在拖延谈判的同时，有计划地对朝中人民发动了灭绝人性的细菌战，并企图依靠所谓“军事压力”来迫使朝中方面让步。但是美方的阴谋一一遭到粉碎。在朝中方面的积极努力和全世界舆论日益增长的压力下，美方终于不得不接受停战。一九五三年七月二十七日在朝鲜板门店签订的停战协定，标志着历时三年多的朝鲜战争终于以侵略者的失败而告终，美国侵略者付出了将近四十万名兵员和巨额物资的代价，并没有改变这个早已注定了的结局。
    朝鲜停战以后，美国当局继续它一贯的政策，企图保持和加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，阻止由于朝鲜停战而造成的国际紧张局势的缓和。美方在停战前夕就背信弃义地纵容李承晚以“释放”为名扣留了二万七千名朝中战俘；在停战实现之后，美方更大规模地利用特务来威胁战俘，破坏解释工作，阻挠战俘遣返，使中立国遣返委员会不能行使其职权，使战俘返回祖国过和平生活的权利横遭剥夺。这些情况为中立国遣返委员会历次发表的文件和报告所完全证实。美方不顾朝中方面的严正抗议和世界舆论的谴责，进而彻底撕毁战俘遣返协议，片面停止解释工作，把二万一千九百多名不直接遣返的朝中战俘强迫扣留下来，交给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。同时，美方竭力阻挠并片面中断了关于朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈，竭力阻挠政治会议的召开。另一方面，美方还一再违反停战协定，运入大批增援性作战物资以加强李承晚伪军，并不断派遣飞机与军事人员侵入朝中地区。所有这些事实证明，美国当局仍然在朝鲜继续执行其挑衅性的保持和加深紧张局势的政策，而无意于协商朝鲜问题的和平解决，使不稳定的停战转为持久的和平。
    在“印度支那问题大事纪要”中，记载了从一九四零年日本军队进入印度支那以来，印度支那人民为推翻帝国主义的奴役压迫、争取民族解放所进行的英勇斗争；写下了法国政府在第二次世界大战后背信弃义、发动战争、进攻它已承认的印度支那人民自己的国家、力图恢复对印度支那人民的殖民统治的事实。同时，这个纪要也记载了美国政府积极干涉这个殖民战争的罪行。美国企图借此保持远东紧张局势，把印度支那变为进攻中国的军事跳板，并以美帝国主义的统治来代替已经频于崩溃的法帝国主义的统治，把这块富饶的地区变为美国的殖民地。
    大家知道，富饶的印度支那从十九世纪中叶起，就开始被法国殖民者一片片地蚕食了，到九十年代，整个印度支那三国全部落入了法国的手掌。一九四○年，已经对中国发动了侵略战争的日本帝国主义开始侵入印度支那。对印度支那人民残暴的法国殖民当局在日本法西斯进攻面前屈辱投降，到一九四五年三月九日，日本就正式全部占领了印度支那。
    然而，具有长期斗争传统的印度支那三国人民起来进行了英勇的抗日斗争。由越南各党派、社会团体在一九四一年五月组成的越南独立同盟（简称越盟），组织人民武装，开辟了解放区，建立了政权机关。举世公认越盟是在越南的唯一抗日力量。法国“马赛曲报”就曾说过：“当法国高级官员乖乖地充当贝当分子的时候，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下以罕有的勇气对日本法西斯作战。”
    一九四五年九月二日，日本投降后，由越南全国人民代表大会选出的越南民主共和国临时政府主席胡志明在河内五十万群众的大会上，宣告越南独立。接着就在一九四六年一月六日，越南民主共和国全国进行了国民大会的选举，百分之九十以上的选民参加了选举。三月三日，国民大会在河内选出了越南民主共和国政府，胡志明当选为主席。一个独立国家的经过民主的、合法选举产生的政府诞生了。这个国家得到了有八亿以上人口的苏联、中国和人民民主国家的承认。在越南宣告独立的同年，寮国、高棉人民也宣布独立，组织了自己的政权。由高棉人民代表大会选出的高棉抗战政府（即中央人民解放委员会）和由自由寮国人民代表大会选出的寮国抗战政府，也在一九五○年先后成立。
    然而，法国殖民者却抱着恢复他们的殖民统治的目的，随着英国军队又爬上了印度支那半岛。为了积蓄力量，伺机进攻，他们和越南民主共和国政府举行了谈判。越南政府在谈判中为求得和平解决，一再努力并作了种种让步，在一九四六年内，终于先后和法方签订了“初步协定”、“参谋协定”和“临时协定”。在这些协定中，法国承认越南民主共和国“是一个自由的国家，有它的政府、国会、军队和财政”，并应停止敌对行动。法方虽然签订了这些协定，但是没有履行义务的诚意。法军一方面积极准备发动大规模战争，一方面在海防、河内等城市一再寻衅。十一月，法军制造海关事件，利用衅端侵占海防和谅山。十二月，又向芒街和定立等地进攻，到十二月十九日，法军完成准备后，在河内发动总攻击，这时，法方完全撕毁了自己的协定，发动了大规模的侵略战争。越南方面为了求得和平解决，始终采取了忍让的态度。胡志明主席从十二月十日起到次年三月下旬，曾向法国方面接连发出八次呼吁，要求恢复和平，但是法方一直不予答复。历史事实清楚地说明了由美国支持、打算在印度支那恢复帝国主义统治的法国政府是挑起印度支那战争的祸首。
    越南人民为了拯救祖国、保卫独立，展开了全民的抗战，给了法国殖民者以严重的打击。七年来，法国殖民军被歼灭三十二万名以上。十八万法国远征军陷在印度支那，丧失了主动权，成为“印度支那稻田的囚犯”。法国方面虽然依靠美国的援助，换了六个总司令，并扶植保大、西萨望·汪和西哈努克分别做越南、寮国、高棉的傀儡国王以欺骗人民，组织伪军来参加作战，但是，这都不能挽回法国的失败。
    美帝国主义利用了法国的困难，一步一步地把它的魔手伸进了印度支那。从一九五○年起，特别是在朝鲜停战后，美国更加紧了它干涉印度支那的活动。一九五○年六月二十七日，美国总统杜鲁门在宣布他已命令美国海、空军参加侵略朝鲜的战争的同时说，他已经命令加速以军事援助供给法伪军，并派遣军事使团前往印度支那。在这以后，美国军事物资大批地运去了，从一九五○年到一九五三年底，美国军事援助物资已超过四十万吨。美国负担的印度支那战费逐渐达到总数的百分之七十以上。美国供给了飞机、军舰，还派遣了美国航空员、技术员去参加战争。美国的将军们如克拉克、奥丹尼尔等和美国的政客如杜威、史蒂文森等川流不息地在印度支那来来去去。美国毫不掩饰地要求取得对军事援助的监督权，要求取得对伪军的训练权，要求法国给保大等傀儡以“独立”而实际上是借此由美国直接地加以控制。美国要想把印度支那由法国的殖民地变为自己的殖民地并由此把它变为进攻中国的军事跳板的野心已经暴露无遗。
    世界人民要求在印度支那恢复和平。从一九四九年起，世界和平运动一再号召结束印度支那战争。越南民主共和国胡志明主席在一九五三年十一月再一次表示了越南人民主张协商和平解决的态度。然而，美国强迫着法国把战争继续打下去。法国统治集团中的某些当权人物在美国的压力和策动下，也仍然没有放弃依靠美国继续进行战争的想法。印度支那为什么不能恢复和平，历史事实已经说明了责任在于美国。
    “亚洲和平与安全问题大事纪要”表明，正是由于美国统治集团在亚洲推行侵略政策，横暴地干涉各国内政，损害各国主权，到处建筑军事基地，执行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的方针，并不顾亚洲各国人民的反对，复活日本军国主义，使得亚洲人民的和平与安全在对日战争结束以后又重新遭到重大的威胁。
    大家知道，早在对日战争结束以后不久，美国就加紧干涉亚洲各国内政，首先是干涉中国的内政。美国给国民党反动政府以大量军事物资的援助，装备与运输了大量国民党军队，使国民党反动派得以发动大规模的进攻中国人民的内战。一九四九年八月五日美国国务院发表的“中美关系”的白皮书，暴露了美国的阴谋就在于把中国完全变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。但是，中国人民的解放斗争“为美国政府控制所不及”，因此这种露骨的干涉遭到了失败。在中国人民革命胜利和美帝国主义侵华政策彻底破产以后，美国统治集团把人民中国看作眼中钉。美国发动了朝鲜战争，企图进一步进攻中国，并公然侵占中国的领土台湾，把它变为美国的军事基地，同时又采取其他种种敌视中国人民的措施，横暴地破坏亚洲各国正常的政治与经济联系。
    复活日本军国主义是美国在亚洲的政策的另一个标志。美国在日本投降以后不久，就着手进行这个工作。从一九四七年八月三十日麦克阿瑟开始释放日本重要战犯起，到一九五一年九月美国一手制造片面“对日和约”和一九五四年三月八日签订美日“共同防御援助协定”的整个过程，说明美国公开违反它所承担的国际义务和国际协议，不顾亚洲广大人民的意志，有计划地扶植日本军国主义势力，企图把日本变成美国发动侵略的基地和威胁亚洲和平与安全的战争策源地。
    纪要所列举的事实同时显示：美国使用种种手段，企图控制亚洲各国的军事、政治和经济，把亚洲各国变为美国的军事基地并利用亚洲人民来充当美国的炮灰。为了达到上述目的，美国当局通过所谓“经济援助”和“军事援助”，通过所谓“调解”争端，通过与亚洲国家订立各种损害各国主权与独立的“条约”和“协定”来束缚亚洲国家的手足，并竭力把这些国家拖到为美国侵略目的服务、反对另外一些国家的东南亚和太平洋的军事联盟中去。十分明显，美国所奉行的这种政策，正是亚洲紧张局势的根源。
    与此相反，中苏两国始终坚决维护亚洲的和平与安全。毛泽东主席在一九五○年六月二十八日的谈话中指出：“亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管，而不应由美国来管。”中国人民全力支持这一原则，反对美国在亚洲干涉他国内政和制造战争的政策。中苏两国人民执行与一切国家和平共处和在平等互利的基础上发展贸易关系的政策。中苏两国坚持反对复活日本军国主义，中苏友好同盟互助条约就规定共同制止日本的重新侵略，维护远东的和平。中苏两国与亚洲国家签订的贸易协定和在联合国组织提出的各项建议，完全证明了两国人民维护与促进和平和发展各国的经济联系的真诚愿望。这些事实充分说明了究竟是谁在危害亚洲和平与安全，谁在维护亚洲的和平与安全。（新华社）
