Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th: "Message News" correspondents in Geneva, Mikhailov and Polianov, wrote: Geneva is currently in the atmosphere of the eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The League of Nations building, which has been quiet in recent years, has now changed: it has become unprecedentedly active, and the conference halls and studios of the delegations of various countries attending the Geneva Conference have been prepared here. In the news headquarters of the League of Nations Building, you can almost meet reporters from all over the world. There are about 1,500 of them.

Many reporters from bourgeois newspapers have come here, not so much to objectively report on the progress of the conference, but to spread distorted news and absurd rumors. Obviously, this means that they will carry out certain instructions from the advocates of the "policy of strength." Only in this way can it be explained why some Swiss bourgeois newspapers spread one rumor after another based on American and British sources. These rumors are used to cover up the special activities of the American diplomatic authorities on the eve of the Geneva Conference. The separate negotiations between Dulles, Eden, and Bidault have just ended in Paris. French newspapers make no secret of the fact that it was the US Secretary of State who proposed holding this negotiation. The main purpose of the negotiation was for the United States to carry out threats and intimidation in order to make its partners adopt a policy favorable to Washington at the Geneva Conference.

Establishing a lasting peace in Korea is one of the tasks of the Geneva Conference. This task cannot be solved if the will of the Korean people, who hope to reunify their country peacefully, is ignored. However, the advocates of the "policy of strength" are afraid of this. The Associated Press of the United States exposed this concern, as it opposes the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. From the news sent by this news agency, it can be seen that the aggressive forces are trying their best to prevent the Korean people from realizing their desire to make their motherland a unified, independent, and democratic country.

The Geneva Conference will also discuss how to restore peace in Indochina by reaching agreements that conform to the principles of freedom and national rights of the Indochinese people, rather than by continuing the hopeless war. Just a reminder of some recent words and deeds of the American ruling group, and no one will doubt that what the American ruling group cares about is not restoring peace in Indochina, but expanding the military conflict in Indochina. These words and deeds clearly violate the logic of the development of the Indochina event and the interests of consolidating peace in Southeast Asia and the world, and have therefore been severely condemned by the most extensive international public opinion. Paris and London cannot but take this into account. It is worth noting that Dulles' provocative proposal to take so-called "united action" in Indochina failed to gain the support of Britain and France as Washington had hoped. This proves that the "policy of strength" in Indochina violates not only the interests of the French people but also the interests of the Asian people, who are increasingly firmly advocating that the Indochina issue be resolved through the speedy restoration of peace in Indochina and the guarantee of the freedom and national rights of the Indochinese people. This is the most important task of the Geneva Conference.

### “消息报”记者报道日内瓦会议前夕情况

    “消息报”记者报道日内瓦会议前夕情况
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：“消息报”驻日内瓦记者米哈伊洛夫和波利扬诺夫写道：日内瓦目前已处在外长会议前夕的气氛中。近年来清闲着的国联大厦现已变了样了：这里已空前地活跃起来，会议厅和出席日内瓦会议的各国代表团的工作室已在这里准备好了。在国联大厦的新闻总部几乎可以碰到来自全世界各国的记者。他们约有一千五百人。
    许多资产阶级报纸的记者到这里来，与其说是为了来客观地报道这次会议的进程，倒不如说是为了散布歪曲的新闻和荒唐的谣言。显然，这就是说他们将要执行“实力政策”鼓吹者的一定的指示。只有这样，才能说明为什么某些瑞士资产阶级报纸根据美国和英国的消息来源，散布出一个甚于一个的谣言。这些谣言是用来掩护美国外交当局在日内瓦会议前夕进行特别活动的烟幕的。杜勒斯、艾登和皮杜尔的单独谈判刚刚在巴黎结束。法国报纸毫不掩饰地说，提议举行这个谈判的是美国国务卿。谈判的主要目的是为了美国要进行威胁和恐吓，以使美国的伙伴们在日内瓦会议上采取有利于华盛顿的方针。
    建立朝鲜的持久和平，这是日内瓦会议的任务之一。如果不顾希望以和平方式统一自己国家的朝鲜人民的意志，这一任务是不可能解决的。然而，“实力政策”的鼓吹者却害怕这一点。美国的合众社暴露出了这种担忧的心情，他反对自朝鲜撤出外国军队。由这个通讯社发出的消息中可以看到，侵略势力在竭力阻挠朝鲜人民实现他们要使祖国成为一个统一、独立、民主的国家的愿望。
    日内瓦会议还将讨论：如何通过达成符合印度支那人民的自由与民族权利原则的协议，而不是通过继续进行那没有希望的战争的办法，来恢复印度支那和平。只须提醒一下美国统治集团最近的一些言行，就不会再有任何人怀疑：美国统治集团所关心的并不是恢复印度支那和平，而是扩大印度支那的军事冲突。这些言行极为明显地违反印度支那事件发展的逻辑，违反巩固东南亚与世界和平的利益，因而受到了最广泛的国际舆论的严厉谴责。巴黎和伦敦不能不考虑到这一点。值得注意的是，杜勒斯关于在印度支那采取所谓“联合行动”的挑衅性的主张没有能像华盛顿所指望地那样获得英国和法国的支持。这就证明，在印度支那采取“实力政策”既违反法国人民的利益，也违反亚洲人民的利益，他们日益坚决地主张，通过尽速恢复印度支那和平、保障印度支那人民的自由和民族权利的途径，解决印度支那问题。这就是日内瓦会议最重要的任务。
