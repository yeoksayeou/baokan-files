Dazhou, Suining, Pingchang and other twelve counties in Sichuan Province are actively supporting poor farmers in production in some districts and townships. These poor farmers generally face many difficulties in production and life due to large populations and meager family wealth. When local county and district leaders address this issue, in addition to conducting ideological education for cadres and the masses, they have adopted the following specific measures: First, relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to help some poor farmers overcome difficulties through mutual assistance and mutual benefit. For example, Banmiao Township in Pingchang County resolved the production difficulties of 50 farming households through mutual assistance and mutual benefit within mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Second, organize poor farmers to engage in sideline production. Banmiao Township in Pingchang County mobilized poor farmers to transport 160,000 jin of grain for cooperatives, earning 6.4 million yuan, solving the difficulties of 40 farming households. In addition, state relief and social assistance also solved the difficulties of some poor farmers.
After adopting these measures, the production enthusiasm of poor farmers in these areas has been greatly improved. After overcoming production difficulties, poor farmers in various villages in Shuanglong Township, Jiangjin County, actively participated in production activities such as water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation.

    四川达县平昌等县积极扶持贫苦农民生产
    四川省达县、遂宁、平昌等十二个县部分区乡，积极扶持贫苦农民生产。这些贫苦农民，大都因人口多，家底薄，生产和生活都有很多困难。各地县区领导上在解决这一问题时，除对干部和群众进行思想教育外，并采取以下各项具体办法：首先，依靠互助合作组织，通过互助互济，帮助一部分贫苦农民克服困难，如平昌县板庙乡通过互助合作组织，展开互助互济，解决了五十户农民生产上的困难；其次，组织贫苦农民搞副业生产。平昌县板庙乡发动贫苦农民给合作社搬运了十六万斤粮，收入六百四十万元，解决了四十户农民的困难。此外，国家的救济和社会的帮助也解决了一部贫苦农民的困难。
    采用这些措施后，大大提高了这些地区的贫苦农民的生产情绪。江津县双龙乡各村贫苦农民在克服生产困难以后，积极参加兴修水利、积肥等生产活动。
