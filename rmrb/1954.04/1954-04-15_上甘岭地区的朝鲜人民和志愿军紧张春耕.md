Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 14th: The Korean people in the Shangganling area are engaging in the first spring plowing since the armistice with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. A labor force composed of youth, women, the elderly, and volunteer soldiers has filled in thousands of bomb craters, and the damaged irrigation systems have been completely repaired. Many Korean people and volunteer soldiers are busily tilling the land that was abandoned during the war. In areas close to the front lines, such as Chengsan-ri and Tapgeo-ri, the cultivated area has been expanded by more than double this year.

A number of new agricultural production cooperatives in the Shangganling area are to be established around this spring plowing season. In Chengsan-ri, which excellently completed the task of supporting the front lines during the war, 95 percent of the farming households have already joined agricultural production cooperatives. Due to improved labor organization and expanded cultivated area, this village plans to produce three times more grain than last year. Chemical fertilizers aided by the Soviet Union and horses aided by the Mongolian People's Republic are constantly being transported to help the Korean people overcome the difficulties in spring plowing in a timely manner.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units stationed here are making the greatest efforts to help residents carry out production and construction. Along the roads and in the mountain gullies, soldiers can be seen helping residents build houses, transport fertilizers and seeds, and till the land. Recently, a certain unit of the Volunteer Army even sent two infantry squads to help the family of martyr Park Jae-geun with spring plowing. The Volunteer Army units stationed in the local area have also provided relief to the families of martyrs, military families, and impoverished farmers who are experiencing difficulties in their lives during spring plowing.

    上甘岭地区的朝鲜人民和志愿军紧张春耕
    【新华社平壤十四日电】上甘岭地区的朝鲜人民，正以空前的劳动热情进行着停战后的第一个春耕生产。青年、妇女、老人和志愿军战士们组成的劳动大军填平了上千个弹坑，被炸坏的灌溉系统也已全部修复。许多朝鲜人民和志愿军战士正在忙碌地翻耕着在战争中荒废了的土地。在紧靠前线的城山里、塔距里等地区，今年都扩大了耕地面积一倍以上。
    上甘岭地区有不少新的农业生产合作社都要在今年春耕前后建立起来。曾在战争期间出色地完成了支援前线任务的城山里，有百分之九十五的农户已经参加了农业生产合作社。由于改善了劳动组织和扩大了耕地面积，这个里今年计划要生产比去年多三倍的粮食。苏联援助的化学肥料和蒙古人民共和国援助的马匹正在不断地运来，及时地帮助朝鲜人民克服了春耕中的困难。
    驻在这里的中国人民志愿军部队正以最大的努力帮助居民进行生产建设。在公路旁、山沟边，到处可以看到战士们在帮助居民修建房屋，搬运肥料、种籽和翻耕土地。最近，志愿军某部还专门派出两个步兵班去帮助朴在根烈士的家属进行春耕。对于春耕生产中生活有困难的烈属、军属和贫苦农户，驻在当地的志愿军部队还进行了救济。
