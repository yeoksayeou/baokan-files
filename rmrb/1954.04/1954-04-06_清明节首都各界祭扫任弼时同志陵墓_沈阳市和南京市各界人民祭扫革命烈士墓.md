During the Qingming Festival, cadres from central, North China, and Beijing municipal organizations and groups, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and students, totaling more than 2,400 people, went to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery to pay respects at the tombs of Comrade Ren Bishi and other revolutionary martyrs.

At 8:00 a.m., with solemn and commemorative feelings, people holding wreaths slowly walked up the steps to Comrade Ren Bishi's tomb, stood in silent tribute, and presented wreaths. Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, Yang Chengwu, Deputy Commander of the North China Military Region, Zhu Liangcai, Deputy Political Commissar, as well as Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary, stood in silent tribute in front of the tomb and circled it once.

A group of future builders—students from the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute and the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School—came to Comrade Ren Bishi's tomb. Under the bright red banner of the Communist Youth League, they solemnly swore to their mentor: "Comrade Bishi! We will surely realize your ideals and build our motherland into a communist garden."

On this day, many people also went to the Wan'an Cemetery to pay respects at the tomb of Martyr Li Dazhao.

Xinhua News Agency reported that in Shenyang, more than 30 representatives from various municipal organizations, democratic parties, and people's organizations went to the Beiling Martyrs' Cemetery and the tombs of Volunteer Army martyrs and PLA martyrs such as Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, and Yang Lian'di in Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 5th to sweep the tombs and pay their respects. In recent days, more than 3,900 representatives of groups have visited, paid their respects, and swept the tombs.

More than 30,000 people from all walks of life in Nanjing swept the tombs at the Yuhuatai Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery around the Qingming Festival. During the 22 years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, about 100,000 revolutionary martyrs and patriots were killed in Yuhuatai. Among them were Deng Zhongxia, the founder of the Chinese workers' movement, Yun Daiying, the leader of the Chinese youth movement, and Luo Dengxian, a general of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

    清明节首都各界祭扫任弼时同志陵墓
    沈阳市和南京市各界人民祭扫革命烈士墓
    五日清明节，中央、华北与北京市各机关团体的干部，人民解放军战士，学生共两千四百余人，前往八宝山革命公墓祭扫任弼时同志和其它革命先烈陵墓。
    上午八点钟，人们怀着肃穆怀念的心情，手持花圈，慢步走上任弼时同志墓前的台阶，默哀致敬献花圈。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通，中央人民政府内务部部长谢觉哉，华北军区副司令员杨成武、副政治委员朱良才，还有中共北京市委书记彭真、副书记刘仁，在墓前默哀致敬后绕墓一周。
    一群未来的建设者——北京钢铁工业学院、北京机器制造学校的学生们，来到了任弼时同志的墓前。他们在鲜红的青年团团旗下，向自己的导师宣读了庄严的誓言：“弼时同志！我们一定实现你的理想，把我们的祖国建设成一座共产主义花园。”
    这一天，很多人还到万安公墓祭扫李大钊烈士墓。
    沈阳市各机关和各民主党派、人民团体代表三十多人，在五日上午前往北陵烈士陵园和中山公园黄继光、邱少云、孙占元、杨连第等志愿军烈士和解放军烈士墓前扫墓致敬。连日来，先后前往瞻仰、凭吊、扫墓的团体代表达三千九百多人。
    南京市各界三万多人在清明节前后到雨花台革命烈士陵扫墓。在国民党反动统治的二十二年中，有十万左右的革命先烈和爱国志士在雨花台遭受杀害。其中有中国工人运动的创始者邓中夏、中国青年运动的领导人恽代英及东北抗日联军的将领罗登贤等。（据新华社讯）
