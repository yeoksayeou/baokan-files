Supporting National Industrial Construction
Beijing Residents Conserve Electricity

The people of Beijing are practicing electricity conservation to save more power to support national industrial construction. From March 11th to the end of March, the city saved the equivalent of 5,500 kilowatts of electricity during the hours of 6:30 PM to 10:00 PM. If this electricity saved over these twenty days were used for production, it could power machinery to produce 1,600 tons of paper or 667,000 bags of flour.

Many factories, government organizations, schools, and citizens throughout the city responded to the Beijing Municipal People's Government's call for electricity conservation and inspected their respective units' electricity usage. Through inspection and education, the significance of conserving electricity has been recognized by the vast number of cadres and citizens. Many units have installed lampshades, cleaned light bulbs to maximize their brightness, relocated improperly positioned lights, changed shared switches to individual switches, and made sure to turn off lights when leaving. Some workshops at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have adopted partial shift changes, without affecting production, to reduce electricity consumption during peak evening hours. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has replaced large light bulbs with smaller ones in non-production areas such as offices and dormitories. Many shops have appropriately reduced neon lights and door lights, and adjusted indoor lighting. The Qianmen branch of the China Department Store saves one-third of its electricity daily without affecting business or office operations. Many units have formulated electricity usage systems and methods to ensure consistent electricity conservation. Citizens are also actively conserving electricity. Yao Dama, a military family member from Huangyangzi Hutong in Nanchang Street, spent a morning visiting three hutongs, mobilizing residents in five large courtyards to conserve electricity.

    支援国家工业建设
    首都人民节约用电
    首都人民实行节约用电，以便省出更多的电力来支援国家工业建设。从三月十一日到三月底，全市在下午六时半到十时的时间内节约出来的电力，就相当于五千五百瓩。这二十天节约下来的电力如果用在生产上，就可以发动机器制造一千六百吨的纸或六十六万七千袋的面粉。
    全市许多工厂、机关团体、学校和市民们响应北京市人民政府关于节约用电的号召，都检查了本单位用电的情况。通过检查和教育，节约用电的意义已为广大干部和市民所认识。许多单位都加装灯罩，擦亮灯泡，使电灯的光度充分发挥，位置不合适的电灯也加以改装，把共用开关改为单独开关，并注意随手关灯等。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂有些车间在不影响生产的原则下，采取局部倒班的办法，减少晚上高负荷时间的用电。石景山钢铁厂在办公室、宿舍等非生产区域内，把大灯泡换小。很多商店适当减少霓虹灯和门灯，屋内的灯也加以调整。中国百货公司前门门市部每天节约三分之一的电力，并不影响营业和办公。许多单位制订了使用电力的制度和办法，以保证节约用电的经常化。市民们也积极节约用电，南长街黄羊子胡同的军属姚大娘一个上午就跑了三条胡同，动员了五个大杂院的居民节约用电。（据新华社讯）
