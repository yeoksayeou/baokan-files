Xinhua News Agency, 12th [April]: In the second year of China's First Five-Year Plan, the railway system will undertake even more arduous transportation tasks.

According to the ratio of China's industrial development speed, the volume of goods transported by rail this year is expected to be more than 15 percent higher than last year, and the number of passengers will increase by 14 percent.

Among freight transport, industrial products will increase the most, especially industrial raw materials, fuels, and capital construction equipment. Coal is the "food" of industry. Because of the increasing need for industrial production, the volume of coal to be transported this year will increase by about 15 percent compared to last year. Even during the off-season for coal transport this spring, the amount of coal transported daily from major coal mines to various industrial cities and rural economic crop areas increased by more than 30 percent compared to the same period last year. This year, because the scale of national capital construction is larger, the amount of mineral building materials transported by rail will be 8.7 percent more than last year. Timber will be 18.3 percent more than last year. The quantity of bricks, tiles, sand, stones, cement, etc., transported by rail to various construction sites every day is very large. After large-scale construction projects start in various places in the spring, the transport volume will be even greater. The volume of petroleum, crude oil, and crude oil products, known as the "blood of industry," is expected to increase by 38.9 percent compared to last year. The planned volume of other major industrial products such as steel and machinery to be handed over to the railway this year is also much larger than last year due to increased production.

The volume of various major agricultural products such as grain and cotton will increase by more than 10 percent compared to last year. After the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the amount of commercial grain increased. At present, tens of thousands of tons of grain are allocated through railways across the country every day, equivalent to the amount of grain transported by all ships and wooden boats in the country in a month. Because of the development of agricultural production and the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the amount of fertilizers, new-style agricultural tools, and daily-use industrial products transported to rural areas this year has increased a lot compared to last year.

When formulating transportation plans, the railway department, in accordance with the principle of ensuring the speed of industrial development in China, puts the transportation tasks of materials needed for current industrial production and 141 new and rebuilt projects aided by the Soviet Union in the primary position of the transportation plan. In order to ensure the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, China's largest iron and steel industrial base, the railway department specially invited representatives from Anshan Iron and Steel to participate in the planning. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Heavy Industry also established a joint office to specifically control the supply of materials and product transportation of Anshan Iron and Steel. The quantity of raw materials, construction equipment, and product exports required by Anshan Iron and Steel is very large. At present, hundreds of train cars across the country are dedicated to transporting raw materials such as coking coal and ore, capital construction equipment, and daily necessities for Anshan Iron and Steel every day. The railway also took some special measures to ensure the supply of materials for key projects. Recently, the Zhengzhou Railway Administration specially allocated locomotives and vehicles to transport sand and stones for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. For temporary transportation tasks handed over by industrial departments, the railway department also tries to load and transport them as extra-plan transportation.

In coordination with the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the railway department also gives priority to grain allocated through railways, ensuring timely supply and timely sales. Taking into account the characteristics of agricultural production, the railway took different measures in different seasons when formulating plans. Fertilizers and new-style agricultural tools are guaranteed to be transported before spring plowing. The flue-cured coal required by tobacco-producing areas such as Henan and Shandong is included in the transportation plan during the tobacco planting season.

Although the railway department overfulfilled the state's transportation plan last year, it did not fully meet the requirements of rapidly developing industrial production for railway transportation. Especially after the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement in the second half of last year, the goods that various industrial departments requested to be transported were very large, but the railway's transportation capacity could not be increased at the same rate. Therefore, in order to gradually solve the main contradiction in the current railway work—the contradiction between transportation volume and transportation capacity—the railway department will focus on improving transportation organization and strengthening the passing capacity of existing railways this year. This year, more than 50 percent of the state's investment in railways will be used to strengthen the equipment of existing railways, extend and build double lines, strengthen existing railway lines and large bridges, and add new vehicles and locomotives. At the same time, in terms of operation and management, it will further promote the advanced experience of the China-Changchun Railway, implement planned management to strengthen the planning and organization of railway transportation, and accelerate the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. Around this year's transportation plan, it will further carry out the movements of full loading, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers, and various business departments have formulated specific and effective technical organization measures. Each train must pull more and run faster than last year, and each train car must load more goods than last year.

### 争取满足工业生产迅速发展的要求  铁路系统将努力提高运输能力

    争取满足工业生产迅速发展的要求
    铁路系统将努力提高运输能力
    【新华社十二日讯】我国第一个五年计划的第二年，铁路系统将担负更加繁重的运输任务。
    根据我国工业发展速度的比率，今年铁路运输的货物预计将比去年多百分之十五以上，旅客人数将增加百分之十四。
    货物运输中增涨得最多的是工业品，特别是工业原料、燃料和基本建设器材。煤是工业的粮食。因为工业生产的需要增多，所以今年煤的运量要比去年增加百分之十五左右。今年春季还是煤运的淡季，每天从各大煤矿运往各工业城市和农村经济作物区的煤就较去年同期增加了百分之三十以上。今年因为国家基本建设的规模更大，经过铁路运输的矿物性建筑材料比去年还要多百分之八点七。木材比去年要多百分之十八点三。现在每天经过铁路运向各工地的砖、瓦、沙、石、水泥等数量很大。春季各地建筑工程大规模开工后，运量还会更大。被称为工业血液的石油、原油及原油制品的运量预计比去年要增加百分之三十八点九。其他各种主要工业产品如钢铁、机械等因为产量增加，今年交给铁路的托运计划也都比去年大得多。
    各种主要农业产品如粮食、棉花的运量将比去年增涨百分之十以上。国家实行粮食统购统销政策之后，商品粮食增加。现在全国每天经过铁路调拨的粮食有几万吨，相当于全国所有轮船木船一个月的运粮量。因为农业生产发展和农村互助合作运动的开展，今年运向农村的肥料、新式农具、日用工业品都比去年增加很多。
    铁道部门在制订运输计划时，按照保证我国工业发展速度的原则，把现有工业生产所需要的物资和苏联援助我国新建和改建的一百四十一项工程的运输任务放在运输计划的首要地位。为了保证我国目前最大的钢铁工业基地鞍钢的生产和建设，铁路部门制订计划时，特别邀请鞍钢的代表参加。铁道部和重工业部还成立了一个联合办公室，专门掌握鞍钢的物资供应和产品运输。鞍钢所需要的原料、建筑器材和产品输出的数量都很大。现在每天全国有成百个的火车皮专为鞍钢运送煤焦、矿石等原料、基本建设器材和生活必需品。铁路还采取一些特殊措施来保证重点工程的材料供应。最近郑州铁路管理局特别拨出机车和车辆专门为武汉长江大桥运输沙石。对于工业部门交给的临时运输任务，铁道部门也尽量作为计划外的运输予以装运。
    配合国家粮食统购统销政策，凡是通过铁路调拨的粮食，铁路部门也尽先列入计划，保证及时供应、及时运销。照顾农业生产的特点，铁路在制订计划时，在不同季节采取不同措施。肥料、新式农具都保证在春耕前运到。河南、山东等产烟区所需要的烤烟煤，在种烟时节就被列入运输计划。
    去年铁路部门虽然超额完成了国家的运输计划，但是并没有完全满足迅速发展的工业生产对铁路运输的要求。特别是去年下半年增产节约运动开展以后，各工业部门要求托运的货物非常多，而铁路的运输能力却不能以同等速度提高。因此铁路部门为了逐步解决当前铁路工作的主要矛盾——运量和运输能力的矛盾，今年铁路工作将以改进运输组织工作和加强现有铁路的通过能力作为重点。今年国家对铁路的投资约有百分之五十以上用于加强现有铁路的设备，延长和修建复线，加强现有铁路线路和大桥，添造新的车辆和机车等方面。同时，在经营管理上将进一步推广中长铁路的先进经验，贯彻计划管理加强铁路运输的计划性和组织工作，加速机车车辆周转。围绕着今年的运输计划将进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，各业务部门都制订了具体有效的技术组织措施。每列列车要比去年拉得更多，跑得更快，每个车皮也要比去年多装一些货物。
