Strengthen the Production and Supply of Non-Staple Foods

Non-staple foods are essential daily food for the people, especially for residents in cities and industrial and mining areas, whose consumption of non-staple foods often exceeds that of staple foods. Several major non-staple foods, such as pork, cooking oil, eggs, aquatic products, vegetables, dried vegetables, and fruits, have seen a surge in sales during holidays and an increase in daily sales in major cities and industrial and mining areas in recent years, with pork and vegetables often falling short of demand. Therefore, strengthening the production and supply of non-staple foods has become an important task for state-owned commercial departments and will continue to be so in the future.

Most non-staple foods are farmers' sideline products. In the years since liberation, with the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for non-staple foods has increased rapidly. Taking the supply of pork as an example, the five major cities in the country increased by about 11 percent in 1952 compared to 1951, and by another 20 percent in 1953 compared to 1952. During the Spring Festival of 1950, Beijing supplied only over 7,000 pigs, but this increased to over 31,000 during the Spring Festival of 1953, and further increased to around 46,000 during the Spring Festival of 1954. The increase in people's purchasing power has, on the one hand, greatly stimulated the increase in production. Currently, the output of many non-staple foods exceeds pre-war levels. This is a very good phenomenon, showing the rise in people's living standards and the prosperity of the national economy. However, on the other hand, because China's agricultural production technology level is still very low, the growth rate of non-staple food production (especially commercial production) cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs; at the same time, because production is very dispersed, seasonal changes are rapid, and transportation and storage losses are huge, the difficulties of non-staple food management and supply are further increased. Judging from the overall situation, the contradiction between production falling short of needs cannot be fundamentally resolved in a relatively long period of time.

However, many business departments lack foresight regarding this change in the supply and marketing of non-staple foods, and the broad masses of the people do not have a deep understanding of it. Because of the lack of foresight, it is impossible to plan the market, which often makes it impossible to do a better job than possible under existing conditions. The temporary tension in pork supply in some cities after the Spring Festival is an example. In this regard, the people's criticism and condemnation are completely reasonable. However, some people, starting from a simple hope, think that all difficulties have disappeared after the victory of the revolution. Therefore, when some non-staple foods are temporarily unavailable or subject to certain restrictions, they express dissatisfaction, which is also very wrong. We know that the current market situation in our country is significantly different from that of capitalism and old China. In capitalist countries, there is often a phenomenon of goods not being sold, which is the result of the cruel exploitation of the people and the reduction of the purchasing power of the broad masses of workers and peasants. In our country, due to the continuous improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of the people, needs often precede production, which is precisely the benefit of the revolution. As for the fact that some industrial and agricultural products cannot yet fully meet the needs of the people, it is only because production cannot yet develop to the level we hope for, that is to say, this is only a difficulty in the high tide of the national economy.

Enemies abroad spread rumors, claiming that changes in the production and sales of certain agricultural products in our country are solely due to excessive exports. Such rumors are of course not worth refuting. Because the broad masses of the people are eating much more today than in the past, this is already a well-known fact. As for exports, the proportion of our current exports to production is not large. The amount of frozen pork exported in 1953 accounted for only about 1.5 percent of the total number of pigs raised nationwide throughout the year, and the export of eggs was less than one-third of that in 1930 before the war. How can this be said to be too much? On the contrary, it is too little. For the sake of construction, we should export some agricultural products to exchange for machines and other equipment. According to the current conversion price, exporting one ton of pork can be exchanged for five tons of steel, one ton of cottonseed oil can be exchanged for five tons of fertilizer, one ton of oranges can be exchanged for two tons of steel or four tons of gasoline, and 130 million eggs can be exchanged for a 25,000-kilowatt thermal power plant. If we can really increase production and save some consumption, this will not have a big impact on everyone's life, but accumulating small amounts can be exchanged for more industrial equipment, which can accelerate the process of national industrialization. This is of course a very good thing, and it is what we should strive to do.

The key to solving the contradiction between the production and sales of non-staple foods lies in continuously and vigorously increasing production. There are very good conditions for this in our country. First of all, our country has a vast countryside, and sideline production has a certain foundation and a lot of experience; especially in recent years, the number of peasant households participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been increasing, which not only facilitates the planned organization of them to expand production, but also further facilitates the exploitation of the potential of rural sideline production. Secondly, we have a vast domestic and international market, and the capacity of these markets is increasing and becoming more prosperous. This situation will inevitably affect and promote the growth of production. Of course, these are only possible conditions, and to turn the possible into reality, we must rely on our subjective efforts. Therefore, commercial and trade departments and rural work comrades in various places must deeply publicize the significance of increasing the production of non-staple foods to farmers, and explain the current production and sales situation of non-staple foods to the broad masses of the people. Because non-staple foods are related to everyone's daily life, everyone must understand the current situation in order to mobilize the broad masses of the people to work together to solve the contradiction between production and consumption. In order to further increase the production of non-staple foods, concrete leadership work must also be carried out. At present, it is particularly necessary to increase the production of pigs, and we must vigorously solve the difficulties in pig feed. Commercial departments and cooperatives in various places should plan to transfer a certain amount of coarse grains, bean cakes, bran, and wheat bran to key pig-producing areas to support farmers' production. Rural work cadres in various places should actively mobilize and organize the masses to grow more pig vegetables, use more substitutes, increase feed, and effectively protect sows and fatten castrated pigs. At the same time, we should also advocate and encourage the increase in the production of oils and other non-staple foods.

Improving the operation and management of non-staple foods is an urgent task. Recently, the China Food Company was established under the Central Ministry of Commerce, specializing in the purchase and sale of non-staple foods, which is an important measure. However, in order to truly do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, we must first correct the business thinking of some commercial cadres in the past. For example, some comrades believe that operating non-staple foods results in large losses and small profits and are unwilling to operate them; some comrades believe that this work is not easy to do well and is easily criticized, so it is better not to do it; and some comrades are afraid of trouble and think that spending every day with pigs and ducks is not promising. These views are wrong. They do not understand that although our commercial work also implements economic accounting and seeks profits, it is completely different from the capitalist profit-seeking business thinking. Our primary purpose is to ensure reasonable supply to the people. They also do not understand that the national economy is a whole, and no link can be missing, and the supply of non-staple foods is related to the lives of everyone in urban and rural areas. Why is doing this work "not promising"? As for not doing work for fear of criticism, it is not an attitude that a revolutionary worker should have.

Of course, to improve the operation and management of non-staple foods, there are many specific tasks that need to be improved. First, we must have a good grasp of price policies. Currently, the most important thing is to prevent various localities from inappropriately raising purchase prices due to the eagerness to purchase. If the ratio of non-staple foods to other commodities is inappropriate, it will cause blind production and affect other aspects of production and supply, and will create new difficulties for the country. Second, we must organize the procurement work well. At present, there are many purchasing agencies, but the scope of procurement is very narrow. For example, the China Food Company purchases about 70 percent of the total national purchase of pigs in one region of East China; the purchase of eggs and other non-staple foods is similar. If we can pay attention to changing this situation, it will be of great benefit to the purchase and sale work. Therefore, we must strengthen the combination of state-owned food companies and cooperatives, and correctly use the power of private merchants, unify the leadership of procurement, and expand the procurement area. Third, we must improve transportation and storage work, promote the advanced experience of long-distance transportation, improve the technology of operation and management, and increase the necessary refrigeration equipment and other warehouses. Fourth, we must organize the supply in a planned way. In the situation where the growth rate of production cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs, the implementation of planned supply is very urgent and very important. At present, some regions act on their own and are unwilling to allow local non-staple foods to be transferred out; some small towns have very high per capita annual consumption, even exceeding that of large cities; and some large and medium-sized cities have not made planned arrangements for the supply of non-staple foods. These phenomena must be appropriately adjusted. If we can do a good job in this regard and mobilize the masses to save appropriately, then the contradiction between the production and needs of non-staple foods can be alleviated a lot; the needs of people's lives and national construction can be further appropriately met.

### 加强副食品生产和供应工作

    加强副食品生产和供应工作
    副食品是人民日常必需的食料，特别是城市和工矿区居民的副食品消费量往往比主食还多。几种主要副食品如猪肉、食油、蛋类、水产、蔬菜、干菜、水果等，在最近几年来，在各大城市及工矿区，不但节日销量激增，而且平日销量也增加了，特别是猪肉和蔬菜常常供不应求。因此，加强对副食品生产和供应的工作，已成为国营商业部门当前的一项重要任务，也是今后市场供应中的一项重要工作。
    副食品大部分是农民的副业产品。解放后的几年来，随着国民经济的发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，副食品的需要量迅速增加。以猪肉的供应为例，全国五大城市一九五二年比一九五一年增加了百分之十一左右，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加了百分之二十。一九五○年春节，北京市供应毛猪还只七千多头，一九五三年春节就增加到三万一千多头，一九五四年春节更增加到四万六千头左右。人民购买力的提高，从一个方面来说，大大地刺激了生产的增加。目前很多副食品的产量，都超过了战前的水平。这是一个十分良好的现象，它显示了人民生活的上升和国民经济的繁荣。可是另一方面，由于我国农业生产技术水平还很低，副食品生产（特别是商品生产）增长的速度还赶不上人民需要增长的速度；同时由于生产十分分散，季节变化很快，运输保管耗损巨大，更增加了副食品经营和供应的困难。从总的情况估计，生产赶不上需要的矛盾，在一个比较长的时期内，还不能根本解决。
    但是，对于副食品供销情况的这种变化，很多业务部门既缺乏预见，广大人民也没有深刻理解。由于预见不到，就不能有计划地安排市场，就往往使得在现有条件下可能作得更好一点的工作也没有作好。春节后若干城市猪肉供应一度紧张的情况就是一个例子。在这一方面，人民的批评和责难是完全合理的。可是也有一些人，只从一个简单的希望出发，以为革命胜利后一切困难都没有了，因而在某些副食品一时供应不上或者受到若干限制的时候，就表示不满，这也是十分错误的。我们知道，目前我国的市场情况和资本主义以及旧中国时有着显著的不同。在资本主义国家，经常发生有货卖不出去的现象，那是由于对人民的残酷剥削和广大工农群众购买力降低的结果。而在我国，由于广大人民生活水平的不断提高，需要经常走在生产的前面，这正是革命的好处。至于某些工农业产品目前还不能完全满足人民的需要，只是由于生产一时还不能发展到我们所希望的水平，也就是说，这只是国民经济高涨中的困难。
    国外的敌人胡造谣言，把我国某些农产品产销情况的变化说成只是由于输出太多的结果。这种流言当然是不值一驳的。因为广大人民今天吃的比过去多的多了，这已经是尽人皆知的事实。至于说到出口，我国目前出口数量占生产量的比重是不大的。一九五三年出口的冻猪肉只占全年全国养猪量的百分之一点五，出口的鸡蛋也还不及战前一九三○年的三分之一。这怎么能说是太多了呢？恰恰相反，这是太少了。为了建设，我们应该输出一些农产品去换取机器和其它器材。按目前的换算价计算，输出一吨猪肉可换五吨钢材，一吨棉籽油可换五吨肥田粉，一吨桔柑可换两吨钢材或四吨汽油，一亿三千多个鸡蛋可换一座两万五千瓩的火力发电厂。如果我们真的能够增多一些生产和节约一些消费，这对每个人的生活影响并不大，而集少成多，却可以换回更多的工业装备，可以加速国家工业化的进程，这当然是很好的事，而且是我们应该这样去努力的。
    解决副食品产销矛盾的关键，是在于不断地大力地增加生产。这在我国是有着很好的条件的。首先就是我国有广大的农村，副业生产有一定的基础，也有不少的经验；特别是最近几年来，参加互助合作运动的农户日益增多，这就不但便于有计划地组织他们扩大生产，也更便于进一步发挥农村副业生产的潜力。其次，我们有广大的国内市场和国际市场，这些市场的容量是日益增大的，日益繁荣的，这种情况，也必然会影响和推动生产的增长。当然，这还只是可能的条件，而要把可能变为现实，就还要靠我们主观的努力。因此，各地的商业贸易部门和农村工作同志，必须向农民深入地宣传增加副食品生产的意义，并向广大人民解释当前副食品的产销情况。因为副食品既然和每人的日常生活都有关系，就必须使人人都明白目前的情况，才能动员广大人民同心协力解决生产和消费的矛盾问题。为了进一步增加副食品的生产，还必须进行具体的领导工作。目前特别应该增加毛猪的生产，要大力解决毛猪饲料的困难。各地商业部门和合作社应有计划地调运一定的粗粮、豆饼和糠、麸给重点产猪地区，扶助农民的生产。各地农村工作干部应积极发动和组织群众多种猪菜，多用代用品，增加饲料，并切实保护母猪，喂肥克郎猪。同时，对于油脂和其它副食品，也应提倡和鼓励增产。
    改善副食品的经营管理工作，是一项刻不容缓的任务。最近在中央商业部之下成立了中国食品公司，专职经营副食品的购销工作，这是一项重要的措施。但是为了真正作好副食品的供应工作，首先必须端正过去某些商业干部中的经营思想。例如有一些同志认为经营副食品损失大赚利小，不愿经营；有一些同志认为这项工作不容易作好，很容易受批评，不如不做；也有一些同志怕麻烦，认为每日和猪鸭为伍，没有出息。这些看法都是错误的。他们不了解我们的商业工作，虽然也要实行经济核算，要获利，但和资本主义唯利是图的经营思想是完全不同的。我们的首要目的，是保证对人民的合理供应。他们也不了解国民经济是一个整体，缺少任何一环都不行，而副食品供应关系着城乡每一个人的生活问题，为什么作这项工作就“没有出息”了呢？至于怕受批评就不做工作，更不是一个革命工作者应有的态度。
    当然，要改善副食品的经营管理，还有很多具体的工作需要加以改进。第一，要很好地掌握价格政策。目前最重要的是要防止各地因为急于收购而不适当地提高收购价格。如果副食品和其它商品的比价不适当，就会造成盲目生产，并影响其它方面的生产和供应工作，就会给国家增加新的困难。第二，要很好地组织采购工作。目前收购的机构很多，而收购的面却很窄。例如中国食品公司在华东一个地区收购的毛猪，占全国收购总量的百分之七十左右；鸡蛋和其它副食品的收购工作也有类似情况。如果能注意改变这种情况，对购销工作都有莫大的好处。因此必须加强国营食品公司和合作社的结合，并正确运用私商的力量，统一采购的领导，扩大收购地区。第三，必须改进运输保管工作，推广长途运输的先进经验，提高经营管理的技术，同时增加必要的冷藏设备和其它仓库。第四，要有计划地组织供应。在生产的增长速度赶不上人民需要的增长速度的情况下，计划供应的实施，是十分迫切和十分重要的。目前，有些地区各自为政，不愿使当地副食品外调；有些小城镇每人每年的消费量很大，甚至超过大城市很多；也有些大中城市对副食品的供应没有进行有计划地安排。这些现象都必须加以适当调整。如果我们能作好这方面的工作，并动员群众适当地节约，那末，副食品生产和需要的矛盾，就可以减轻许多；人民生活和国家建设的需要，就可以进一步得到适当的满足。
