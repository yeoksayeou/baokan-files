Workers distributed leaflets on the docks protesting the shipment of weapons to Indochina. A resolution they passed stated: "We believe this shipment is an insult to the friendly and peaceful relations we have been seeking with our Asian neighbors."

    澳大利亚码头工人举行罢工
    拒绝装运送到印度支那的军火
    【新华社十日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚码头工人从七日起举行罢工，拒绝把运到印度支那去援助法国进行侵略战争的武器和弹药装船。工人们在码头上散发了抵制把武器运往印度支那的传单。他们通过的一项决议说：“我们认为这种装运是对我们一直谋求的和我们的亚洲邻国的友好与和平关系的一种侮辱。”直到九日，罢工还在坚持。
