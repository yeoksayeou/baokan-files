Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The American "Stone Weekly" published an article in its April 5th issue commenting on Dulles's March 29th speech clamoring for "united action" to intervene in the Indochina national liberation movement.

The article said: "In Dulles's speech to the Overseas Press Club, the key words and most important phrases were 'by whatever means.'" Dulles said at the time that if the political systems practiced by the Soviet Union and China were also implemented in Southeast Asia, "they should not be passively accepted 'by whatever means'… but should be countered with united action."

The article pointed out: Dulles's statement "calls for united action to oppose internal changes – brought about 'by whatever means.' This (referring to internal changes) is very broad and could include not only revolution, but also a peaceful settlement that might establish a united Indochina government, or even a democratic election in which the Communist Party legitimately wins a majority of voters."

The article exposed the United States' violent policy of opposing the people of Southeast Asia from realizing national independence and democratic freedom according to their own wishes, pointing out that the United States' policy "will state in advance that we will not accept certain political ideas in this region, ideas that are chosen 'by whatever means'." This is "difficult to reconcile" with the so-called "free election" attitude that the United States verbally touts.

The article also said: "Only those who mistake recklessness for strength will think that Dulles has adopted a strong attitude. His attitude actually reflects the weakness of the Eisenhower government."

### 美国“斯通周刊”发表文章  评杜勒斯扩大干涉印度支那战争的叫嚣

    美国“斯通周刊”发表文章
    评杜勒斯扩大干涉印度支那战争的叫嚣
    【新华社十日讯】美国“斯通周刊”在四月五日出版的一期中刊载文章，评论杜勒斯三月二十九日叫嚣采取“联合行动”干涉印度支那民族解放运动的演说。
    文章说：“在杜勒斯对海外记者俱乐部发表的演说中，关键性的字和最重要的词句是‘不论用哪一种方式’。”杜勒斯当时说，如果苏联和中国所实行的政治制度也施行于东南亚，“不论用哪一种方式……都不应该消极地接受，而应该用联合行动来对付”。
    文章指出：杜勒斯的这种说法，也就“要求为了反对内部的变动——‘不论用哪一种方式’所促成的——而采取联合行动。这（指内部的变动）是十分广阔的，不但可以包括革命，而且还包括一个可能成立印度支那联合政权的和平解决，甚至包括共产党合法地获得大多数选民的民主选举。”
    文章揭露了美国强暴地反对东南亚人民按照自己的愿望实现民族独立和民主自由的政策，指出：美国的那种政策，“将事先说明，我们在这个地区不会接受某些政治上的观念，这种观念‘不论是用哪一种方式’选择出来的”。这和美国口头上标榜的所谓“自由选举”的态度，“是很难互相符合的”。
    文章并说：“只有那些把蛮干误认为力量的人，才会认为杜勒斯采取了一个强有力的态度。他的态度实际是反映了艾森豪威尔政府的虚弱。”
