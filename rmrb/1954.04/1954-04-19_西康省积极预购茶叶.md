Xikang Province Actively Purchases Tea in Advance

    In order to support tea farmers' production and meet the needs of the Tibetan people for border tea (tea supplied to ethnic minorities), the Xikang Provincial Company of the China Tea Company is actively carrying out tea pre-purchase work.

    This year, the price of tea purchased in Xikang Province has been raised by an average of about 18% compared to 1953, and tea farmers' income will increase by more than 12.5 billion yuan. The funds for pre-purchasing tea this year have also increased by about eight times compared to last year. This will play a significant role in supporting tea farmers' production. In the tea pre-purchase work, in addition to direct pre-purchase by tea factories, pre-purchase is generally entrusted to cooperatives. The Xikang Provincial Company of the China Tea Company and the Preparatory Committee of the Xikang Provincial Cooperative Union have also sent cadres to Ya'an, Yingjing, Tianquan, Lushan and other counties to assist supply and marketing cooperatives in carrying out pre-purchase work.

    西康省积极预购茶叶
    中国茶业公司西康省公司为扶植茶农生产，满足藏族人民对边茶（供应少数民族的茶叶）的需要，积极开展茶叶预购工作。
    西康省今年收购茶叶的价格比一九五三年平均调高了百分之十八左右，茶农的收入将比去年增加十二亿五千多万元。今年预购茶叶的资金又比去年约增加八倍。这将对扶植茶农生产起很大作用。在茶叶预购工作中，除茶厂直接预购一部分外，一般都委托合作社预购。中国茶业公司西康省公司和西康省合作社联合社筹备委员会，并派出干部，分赴雅安、荥经、天全、芦山等县，协助供销合作社开展预购工作。（西南对外贸易局通讯组等）
