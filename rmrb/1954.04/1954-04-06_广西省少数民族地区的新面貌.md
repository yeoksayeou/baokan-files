The province of Guangxi is a multi-ethnic region. Out of the 74 counties and 5 cities in the province, all but 12 counties and 1 city have minority populations. According to incomplete statistics, the province has a total minority population of 6.3 million people, accounting for approximately one-third of the province's total population. The Zhuang people have the largest population, with over 5.4 million people. Next are the Yao people, with approximately 440,000 people. The Miao people number around 180,000. The Dong people number around 140,000. The Hui people number over 8,000. There are also some other ethnic groups with smaller populations.

Before liberation, the reactionary ruling class of Guangxi consistently implemented the most brutal rule over the people of all ethnic groups. In 1933 alone, the Kuomintang reactionaries massacred more than 300 people from minority ethnic groups in northern Guangxi. In one township in Longsheng County, almost all literate people were killed.

The Kuomintang reactionaries once established a fake "Administration Bureau" in Jinxiu (now Dayao Mountain), implementing a vicious policy of so-called "divide and conquer" to split and provoke disunity among the various ethnic groups. Instances of discrimination, insult, and disregard for minority ethnic groups were countless.

The Kuomintang reactionaries imposed as many as thirty or forty kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies on the people of minority ethnic groups, leaving them to live a life of semi-starvation. For example, the Yao people of the Shiwan (Ten Thousand) Mountains relied on cassava for food all year round, and the Miao and Yao people of Longsheng County dug fern roots (grass roots) to eat for generations. Many Yao and Miao people had never seen cotton clothes or quilts in their entire lives; some families only had one set of clothes and ate chili peppers as a substitute for salt all year round. The reactionary rule forced minority ethnic groups to gradually move to remote mountainous and rocky or semi-rocky areas.

Due to poverty, 99 percent of the people of minority ethnic groups were illiterate. According to a survey in Nandan County, only four out of 10,624 people were literate. As for medical care and hygiene, it was out of the question. Therefore, diseases were rampant; malaria, dysentery, smallpox, and leprosy were almost everywhere.

Before liberation, the suffering of minority ethnic groups in Guangxi Province under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was profound. As a Yao woman in Dayao Mountain said, "With the Kuomintang's heaven, there is no heaven for us Yao people."

The "heaven of the Kuomintang" was finally shattered by the advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, in the early days of liberation, because a small number of remnant bandits ran to the minority areas to harass the people, the suffering and disaster of the minority people were still very deep. In order to relieve the suffering of the people, the People's Liberation Army braved all hardships and difficulties and went deep into the minority mountain areas to suppress bandits. During the bandit suppression, the PLA's excellent discipline and respect for the customs and habits of the minority ethnic groups moved the minority people. Everyone enthusiastically supported the PLA in combat, organized militias to cooperate, and helped by guiding the way, delivering food, and sending messages, which gave the People's Liberation Army great help, and thus quickly eliminated the bandits.

After the bandits were wiped out, the central government immediately organized visiting delegations, carrying a large number of gifts and film teams to Guangxi to conduct general consolations for minority ethnic groups and promote Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. Because the central visiting delegation displayed a high degree of class fraternal spirit, the awareness of the minority ethnic groups was greatly improved. They regarded the Communist Party as a savior and Chairman Mao as a benefactor, vying to say, "Chairman Mao is a Miao person," "Chairman Mao is a Yao person," and "He is a great benefactor who saved our lives."

Under the direct help and guidance of the central visiting delegation, Guangxi Province began to vigorously promote the policy of ethnic regional autonomy in July 1951. In that year, the Longsheng United Autonomous Region of Various Ethnic Groups at the county level and the Dongshan Yao Autonomous Region of the whole county at the district level were first established. From January to September 1952, five ethnic autonomous regions at the county level, including the Dayao Mountain Yao Autonomous Region, the Damiao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region, and the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, were successively established.

In September 1952, Guangxi Province held an ethnic work conference to further study how to implement the central government's ethnic policies. After the meeting, based on summarizing the experience of the previous stage of work, the larger Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Longlin United Autonomous Region of Various Ethnic Groups at the county level, and two autonomous regions at the district level were established. Recently, three more autonomous regions at the district level have been established. Up to now, the province has successively established one autonomous region equivalent to an administrative office, five at the county level, eight at the district level, and about forty at the township level, totaling 5.8 million minority people, including more than ten ethnic groups, realizing their right to "be their own masters" in managing their own ethnic affairs.

In the process of promoting ethnic regional autonomy, a large number of ethnic cadres were trained and promoted, laying a good foundation for the nationalization of autonomous organs. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 13,000 minority ethnic cadres in government departments throughout the province. Most of these cadres are trained through methods such as teaching apprentices at work, special training in schools, and organizing visits. For example, the Guangxi Branch of the Central Institute for Nationalities (now renamed Guangxi Provincial Institute for Nationalities) was established in March 1952, and four training classes for minority administrative cadres were held in Baise, Yishan, Pingle, and Guixi. To date, 1,343 people have graduated and been assigned to work. In addition, outstanding young people from minority ethnic groups in Guangxi have been selected to study at the Central, Central South Institute for Nationalities, and Southern University. Various professional departments have also trained some minority ethnic professional cadres in banking, trade, health, etc., through work or school training classes.

Because the Party and government leading organs of Guangxi Province have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, all minority areas that have implemented ethnic regional autonomy have shown a thriving new look. The political awareness of minority ethnic groups has increased day by day. Many vivid examples have emerged in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and other work. Mutual solidarity among the various ethnic groups and within each ethnic group has also been strengthened. For example, when the Damiao Mountain implemented regional autonomy, the Han people spontaneously organized a Yangko dance team to celebrate for them. When brotherly ethnic groups came to the city to participate in the celebration, the Han people gave up their houses and cooked tea to entertain them. The minority ethnic people were moved to tears by the deep affection of the Han people. For example, more than 200 Han people in the third district of Longlin voluntarily helped the Miao immigrants move down the mountain and built more than 30 houses. It has become a common phenomenon in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region for Han and Zhuang farmers to help people of other ethnic groups with farming and sewing.

When Guangxi Province was first liberated, the production and life of all minority ethnic groups were extremely difficult, lacking means of production, and suffering from severe natural disasters. However, after four years of active leadership and assistance from the Communist Party and the People's Government, this historically inherited poverty and backwardness has undergone tremendous changes.

In the early days of liberation, the People's Government first solved the most urgent needs of minority ethnic groups, such as food rations, clothing, and daily necessities. Over the past four years, more than 52 billion yuan has been allocated for minority relief funds. In 1951, more than 20,000 pieces of cold-weather clothing were issued, and in 1953, more than 540,000 pieces of clothing and quilts and more than 27,000 mosquito nets were issued.

In order to fundamentally solve the production and living problems of minority ethnic groups living in rocky and semi-rocky areas, since 1952, the People's Government has been planning and gradually mobilizing and helping local people to move down the mountains in areas where it is truly necessary and where conditions permit. The central government and the Central South region have successively allocated 10.9 billion yuan in special funds for immigrants. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 12,085 people were relocated in 1952 and the first half of 1953. Currently, another group is in the process of being relocated.

On the basis of the above work, relevant provincial departments convened specialized meetings on production, finance, and trade in minority areas to further study and deploy production, trade, and other work in various ethnic areas. Over the past four years, the central government and the Central South region have allocated a total of 100 billion yuan in various special funds to minority ethnic groups, which have been distributed to minority areas in the form of agricultural loans, investments, and orders. This work has created good conditions and a material foundation for changing the economic outlook of minority ethnic groups and further improving the lives of minority ethnic groups.

Through ethnic regional autonomy and other series of works, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been greatly improved, and the broad masses of minority farmers have invested in the agricultural production increase movement. According to incomplete statistics, the province's minority ethnic groups have reclaimed more than 1.62 million mu of wasteland (excluding Zhuang areas). In 1953, the area planted with corn in Guixi increased by 260,000 mu compared to 1952.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various minority areas where land reform has been implemented has made great progress. For example, in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 2,909 permanent mutual aid groups and 60,819 temporary mutual aid groups have been organized, accounting for 13 percent of the region's population. According to preliminary statistics at the end of 1952, there were also 810 temporary mutual aid groups in Dayao Mountain. Other regions have had similar developments. Generally, the organized farming households have increased production by about 20 percent compared to individual farming households.

The People's Government has made many great efforts in leading the various ethnic groups to improve farming techniques and overcome floods, droughts, animal pests, and insect disasters. In the past, minority ethnic areas lacked not only means of production but also backward farming techniques. The People's Government has promoted advanced technologies and experiences such as processing and fertilizing, intensive farming, popularizing improved varieties, selecting seeds with salt water, close planting of small seedlings, and applying fertilizers in stages to varying degrees, so that the farming techniques of minority farmers in various places have gradually improved. For example, in various counties of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, they have generally achieved two plows, three harrows, and four weedings. In some areas, "mountain land has been transformed into dry land," and "dry land has been transformed into paddy fields." The habit of not fertilizing has begun to change.

The People's Government actively reduces the threat of floods and droughts to the people of minority ethnic groups by investing in the construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects and mobilizing the masses to engage in small-scale water conservancy projects. In the spring of 1953, 15 counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region mobilized farmers to rush to repair 3,700 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects and build 3,500 new ones, ensuring that 780,000 mu of land would not suffer from drought. The People's Government also led farmers of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas to fight against animal pests, constantly summing up and exchanging experiences, and rewarding model animal killers.

Over the past four years since liberation, although all ethnic areas have suffered disasters of varying degrees, the Party and government organs at all levels have mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties, making most areas harvest bumper crops year after year and achieve increased production. The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region increased production by 8 percent in 1953 compared to the previous year. Individual areas have increased production by 50 to 100 percent due to the expansion of cultivated land area. Wei Shaoqiu, a model agricultural laborer of the Zhuang ethnic group in Luocheng, created a new record for high-yield corn production in the mountainous areas of Guangxi last year, with a yield of 720 jin per mu.

The increase in production has increased the possibility of expanding reproduction, and farmers of all ethnic groups have used production income and government loans to purchase additional means of production. According to incomplete statistics from 30 counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the first half of 1953 alone, farmers added more than 13,000 head of cattle and more than 170,000 pieces of agricultural implements. In 1952, excluding the Zhuang areas, other minority areas in the province also purchased 8,909 head of cattle and 200,3496 pieces of agricultural implements, and bought more than 16,000 head of livestock such as pigs and sheep.

In addition, forestry production and trade cooperation in minority areas have also made great progress. The People's Government has actively led the people of all ethnic groups to carry out seedling cultivation, afforestation, forest protection, and the development of economic forests, as well as planned logging, purchasing, and sales. In 1952, government investment alone in afforestation in minority areas throughout the province reached more than 242,000 mu. From January to September 1951, the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region alone shipped out more than 160,000 sleepers and strips of wood, which not only increased the income of minority ethnic groups but also had a significant impact on the economic construction of the motherland.

Over the past four years, state-owned trade departments have established trade organizations in minority areas, supplying cheap daily necessities, purchasing local specialties at fair prices, and actively and systematically opening up sales channels for local specialties of minority ethnic groups. According to preliminary statistics, there are currently 371 state-owned trade units (including trade companies, retail stores, department stores, and purchasing and marketing groups, etc.) in minority areas throughout the province (excluding some mixed residential areas). Counties and most districts with minority ethnic groups have established cooperatives, which greatly facilitate the living needs of minority ethnic groups. In the past, people in mountainous areas had to carry grain over mountains and ridges for three or four hundred miles and travel for more than ten days to buy a pot. Now, they can buy it after walking a short distance.

Because the trade departments in various places have correctly grasped the price policy, achieved door-to-door delivery and local purchase, and gradually reduced the phenomenon of unequal exchange in the primary market of minority ethnic areas, they have effectively cracked down on illegal merchants who have consistently engaged in deception and plundering of minority ethnic groups in the past. For example, in Baise, five and a half jin of rice used to be exchanged for one jin of salt, but now only one and a half jin of rice is needed to exchange for one jin of salt. The phenomenon of minority ethnic groups having money but not being able to buy salt has become a thing of the past.

In this way, the lives of minority ethnic groups have undergone significant changes. For example, the immigrants of Baliu and Batun villages in Donglan used to fill their hunger with wild vegetables in spring and summer and had no clothes or quilts, but now every family has clothes, quilts, and mosquito nets. Huang Jinkuan, a poor Zhuang farmer in Shanglin County, has three sets of new clothes and a set of sanitary clothing for each of his seven family members. He also made two cotton quilts last year, and the children also sewed cotton-padded jackets and went to school. Such examples are very common.

With economic and political emancipation, the demands of minority ethnic groups for culture and education have also become urgent. The number of schools and students has increased significantly. According to incomplete statistics, in 1953, the province had 69,400 students from various ethnic groups such as Yao, Miao, and Dong, an increase of ten times compared to 1950. The number of Zhuang students reached 829,500. In the Xishan Yao Autonomous Region of Donglan County, there was no school before liberation, but now there is one complete primary school and 35 general primary schools. In 1953, 1,329 children were enrolled. Each county in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region has one to five middle schools. In 1952, there were 3,573 junior high school graduates, and in 1953, the number of graduates increased to 8,322.

There are now 79 cultural centers and stations in minority areas. Xinhua bookstores have been established successively to supply a large number of books and textbooks to meet the cultural needs of the masses. Lantern slide and film education work teams have also been increased year by year, with two to four teams (another 19 teams in Guixi in 1953) regularly touring minority areas. A national cinema was also established in 1953.

There are now 48 hospitals, 4 branch hospitals, and 209 health centers in minority areas throughout the province. The People's Government has allocated 16.4 billion yuan in special health subsidies in two years to provide free medical care for minority ethnic groups and expand medical equipment and medicines, effectively helping the development of health undertakings in minority areas.

Medical treatment and epidemic prevention have been the focus of health work over the past four years. The prevalence of infectious diseases that are most harmful to minority ethnic groups has now been basically controlled. Malaria, smallpox, typhoid fever, and dysentery, which have plagued minority ethnic groups for thousands of years, have now been greatly reduced. Over the past year, the provincial ethnic health work team has climbed over mountains and ridges and traveled to 10 autonomous regions, including Damiao Mountain, and more than a dozen counties, including Nandan, providing free diagnosis and treatment for more than 92,400 people of all ethnic groups.

While carrying out medical treatment and epidemic prevention work, maternal and child health care and patriotic health movements were also carried out. Midwives and health workers were trained, new midwifery methods were promoted, infant mortality rates were reduced, and the tragic situation of "seeing only mothers carrying children, but not seeing children walking" was reversed.

    广西省少数民族地区的新面貌
    赵卓云
    广西是一个多民族的省份，在全省七十四个县和五个市中，除十二个县和一个市外，都有少数民族聚居。据不完全的统计，全省共有少数民族人口六百三十万人，约占全省人口的三分之一。其中僮族人口最多，约有五百四十多万人。其次是瑶族，约有四十四万人。苗族约有十八万人。侗族约有十四万人。回族约有八千多人。其他尚有一些人口较少的民族。
    解放前，广西的反动统治阶级对各族人民一直实行着最残酷的统治。一九三三年一年，桂北的少数民族人民就被国民党反动派屠杀了三百多人；龙胜县有一个乡，差不多凡是认得一些字的人都被杀掉了。
    国民党反动派曾经在金秀（现大瑶山）设立伪“设治局”，实行所谓“分而治之”的毒辣政策，来分裂和挑拨各民族的团结。对少数民族的歧视、侮辱和不当人看的事情，更是数不胜数。
    国民党反动派加在少数民族人民头上的苛捐杂税，达三、四十种之多，使少数民族人民过着半饥饿的生活。例如十万大山的瑶族，常年靠吃木薯生活，龙胜苗、瑶族人民有的世世代代挖蕨根（草根）吃。很多瑶、苗族人民一辈子没有见过棉衣棉被，有的全家只有一套衣服，常年以辣椒当盐吃。反动的统治，逼得少数民族逐渐移向偏僻的山区和石山或半石山地区。
      由于生活贫困，少数民族人民百分之九十九不识字。据南丹县的调查，在一万零六百二十四人中，识字的仅四人。至于医药卫生，更是谈不到。因此疾病很多，疟疾、痢疾、天花、麻疯，几乎无处不有。
    解放前，广西省少数民族在国民党反动统治下的苦难是深重的。诚如大瑶山一位瑶族妇女所说的：“有国民党的天，就没有我们瑶家的天。”
      “国民党的天”在中国人民解放军的进军下，终于被粉碎了。但在解放之初，因为有一小部分残余匪帮跑到少数民族地区去骚扰，所以当时少数民族人民的痛苦和灾难还是很深重的。为了解除人民的痛苦，人民解放军不避任何艰苦困难，深入到少数民族山区去剿匪。剿匪中，解放军的优良纪律和尊重少数民族风俗习惯的行动，感动了少数民族人民，大家热烈地支援解放军作战，组织民兵配合，并帮助带路、送粮、送信，给了人民解放军以很大的帮助，因而很快地剿灭了土匪。
    剿灭了土匪以后，中央立即组织访问团，携带大批慰问品及电影队到达广西，对少数民族进行普遍慰问，宣传毛主席的民族政策。由于中央访问团发挥了高度阶级友爱的精神，使少数民族人民觉悟大为提高，把共产党看作救星，把毛主席看作恩人，争着说：“毛主席是苗家人”、“毛主席是瑶家人”，“是救命的大恩人”。
    在中央访问团直接帮助和指导下，广西省于一九五一年七月开始大力推行民族区域自治政策。当年首先建立了县一级的龙胜各族联合自治区和区一级的全县东山瑶族自治区。一九五二年一月至九月，又相继建立了县一级的大瑶山瑶族自治区、大苗山苗族自治区、三江侗族自治区等五个民族自治区。
    一九五二年九月，广西省召开了民族工作会议，进一步研究了如何贯彻中央的民族政策。会后，在总结了前一阶段工作经验的基础上，又建立了规模较大的桂西僮族自治区，以及县一级的隆林各族联合自治区和两个区一级的自治区，最近又建立了三个区一级的自治区。到目前为止，全省先后建立了相当于行署一级的自治区一个，县级的五个，区级的八个，乡级的约四十个，总计有五百八十万少数民族人口，包括十多个民族，实现了他们在管理本民族事务上“当家作主”的权利。
    在推行民族区域自治工作过程中，同时培养和提拔了大批民族干部，为自治机关民族化打下了良好基础。据不完全统计，全省政权部门有一万三千多少数民族干部。这批干部，绝大部分是以工作中带徒弟及学校专门训练，组织参观等方式培养出来的。如一九五二年三月成立了中央民族学院广西分院（现改名广西省民族学院），在百色、宜山、平乐及桂西开办了四个少数民族行政干部训练班，至目前为止，经毕业分配工作的达一千三百四十三人，此外还选送了广西少数民族优秀青年到中央、中南民族学院及南方大学学习。各级专业部门在工作中或学校训练班中，也培养了一些银行、贸易、卫生等少数民族专业干部。
    由于广西省党、政领导机关认真地贯彻了毛主席的民族政策，凡是实行了民族区域自治的少数民族地区，都呈现了欣欣向荣的新气象。少数民族的政治觉悟日益提高。在抗美援朝等运动和其他工作中，出现了很多生动的事例。各民族相互间及各民族内部，也更加团结了。如大苗山实行区域自治时，汉族群众自动组织秧歌队为他们欢庆，兄弟民族到城里参加庆祝会，汉族人民让出房屋，煮茶水招待，少数民族人民为汉族人民的深情厚意感动得流泪。又如隆林三区的汉族人民二百多人，自愿帮助苗族移民下山，盖好三十多座房屋。桂西僮族自治区内汉、僮族农民帮助教会其他民族人民种田缝衣，成为普遍的现象。
    广西省刚解放时，各少数民族的生产和生活都极为困难，缺乏生产资料，灾荒严重。但是这种历史上遗留下来的贫困落后面貌，经过四年来共产党和人民政府的积极领导与扶助，现在已经起了巨大的变化。
    初解放时，人民政府首先解决少数民族最迫切的要求如口粮、衣被、日用品等问题。四年来共拨出少数民族救济经费五百二十多亿元，一九五一年还发了救济寒衣二万多件，一九五三年又发出衣被达五十四万多件，蚊帐二万七千多床。
    为了从根本上解决居住石山、半石山区少数民族人民的生产生活问题，自一九五二年起，人民政府就在确有必要、且有条件的地区，有计划地逐步动员并帮助当地人民移下山来。中央和中南区并先后拨给了移民经费专款一百零九亿元。据不完全统计，一九五二年及一九五三年上半年共计移民一万二千零八十五人。目前还有一批正在迁移中。
    在上述的工作基础上，省级各有关部门召开了少数民族地区的生产、财经、贸易等专业会议，进一步研究与布置了各民族地区的生产、贸易等工作。中央和中南区四年来拨给各少数民族的各项专款，共达一千亿元，分别以农贷、投资、定货等项发放到少数民族地区。这些工作，为改变少数民族的经济面貌和进一步改善少数民族人民的生活创造了良好的条件和物质基础。
    通过民族区域自治和其他一系列的工作，大大地提高了群众的生产情绪，广大的少数民族农民投入了农业增产运动。据不完全统计，全省少数民族开荒达一百六十二万多亩（不包括僮族地区）。一九五三年桂西种植玉米的面积比一九五二年扩大二十六万亩。
    在党的正确领导下，已实行土地改革的各少数民族地区的互助合作运动有了很大的发展。如桂西僮族自治区已组织起来的常年互助组二千九百零九个，临时互助组六万零八百十九个，组织起来的人口占全区人口百分之十三。大瑶山一九五二年底初步统计，临时互助组也有八百一十个。其他地区也有同样的发展。组织起来的农户一般比单干户增产百分之二十左右。
    人民政府领导各兄弟民族在改进耕作技术方面、战胜水旱兽害虫灾方面，作了许多很大的努力。少数民族地区过去除缺乏生产工具外，耕作技术也很落后。人民政府就在不同程度上推行了加工加肥、精耕细作、推广良种、盐水选种、小株密植、分期施肥等先进技术和经验，使各地少数民族农民的耕作技术日渐提高。如桂西僮族自治区各县，一般已作到二犁、三耙、四耘。部分地区还将“山地变为旱田”，“旱田变为水田”。不施肥的习惯已开始扭转。
    人民政府从积极方面解除水灾、旱灾对少数民族人民的威胁，投资重点兴修了大型、中型水利，并发动群众搞小型水利。一九五三年春，桂西僮族自治区十五个县即发动农民抢修中、小型水利三千七百处，新建三千五百处，保证了七十八万亩田不受旱灾。人民政府并领导山区各族农民向兽害作斗争，不断总结和交流经验，奖励打兽模范。
    解放四年来，各民族地区虽然都遭受过程度不同的灾害，但由于各级党、政机关发动群众战胜了困难，使绝大部分地区连年丰收，获得增产。桂西僮族自治区一九五三年比上年增产百分之八。个别地区由于耕地面积扩大而有增产百分之五十到百分之百的。罗城僮族甲等农业劳动模范韦绍裘去年创造了广西山区玉米高额丰产的新纪录——一亩收七百二十斤。
    生产的提高，增加了扩大再生产的可能，各族农民纷纷以生产所得与政府贷款添购生产资料。仅据一九五三年上半年桂西僮族自治区三十个县的不完全统计，农民添购了耕牛一万三千多头，农具十七万多件。一九五二年除僮族地区外，全省其他少数民族地区也购置了耕牛八千九百零九头，农具二十万零三千四百九十六件，并买了猪、羊等家畜一万六千多头。
    此外，少数民族地区的林业生产和贸易合作事业也都有很大的发展。人民政府曾积极领导各族人民进行育苗、造林、护林、发展经济林，也进行有计划地采伐、收购和运销。一九五二年全省少数民族地区单由政府的投资造林即有二十四万二千多亩，仅三江侗族自治区一九五一年一月至九月运出的枕木、条木即有十六万多株，这不仅增加了少数民族人民的收入，并且对祖国的经济建设有着很重大的意义。
    四年来，国营贸易部门在少数民族地区建立了贸易机构，供应廉价日用品，以公平价格收购土特产，积极而有计划的为少数民族打开土特产的销路。据初步统计，目前全省少数民族地区已建立国营贸易单位（包括贸易公司、门市部、百货商店、购销组等）三百七十一个（部分杂居区未计），少数民族的县以及大部分区，都建立了合作社，大大地便利了少数民族人民的生活需要。过去山区人民为了买一顶锅头，就要背着粮食爬山越岭走三、四百里，来回十几天。现在走不多远，就能买到。
    由于各地贸易部门正确地掌握了价格政策，做到了送货上门，就地收购，逐步减少了少数民族地区初级市场不等价交换的现象。从而有力地打击了过去一贯对少数民族进行欺骗掠夺的不法奸商。如百色过去五斤半大米换一斤盐，现在只需一斤半米就能换一斤盐。少数民族有钱买不到盐的现象已成为过去的事。
    这样，少数民族人民的生活就有了显著的变化。如东兰巴廖、巴屯两屯移民，过去在春夏季以野菜充饥，无衣无被，现在衣服被子、蚊帐家家都有。上林县僮族贫农黄锦宽家七口人每人都有三套新衣服，一套卫生衣，去年还做了两床棉被，小孩子们也缝了棉袄，上了学。像这样的例子是很普遍的。
    随着经济上和政治上的翻身，少数民族人民对于文化教育的要求也迫切起来。学校、学生数量有显著的增加。据不完全统计，一九五三年全省瑶、苗、侗等各族学生达六万九千四百人，较一九五○年增加了十倍。僮族学生数达到了八十二万九千五百人。东兰县西山瑶族自治区，解放前一所学校没有，现在已有完全小学一所，一般小学三十五所。一九五三年入学儿童达一千三百二十九人。桂西僮族自治区各县都有一所至五所中学，一九五二年初中毕业生三千五百七十三人，一九五三年毕业生增至八千三百二十二人。
    少数民族地区的文化馆、站已有七十九所。并先后设立了新华书店，大量供应各种图书课本，以满足群众的文化要求。幻灯及电影教育工作队也逐年增加，经常有二队至四队（一九五三年桂西另有十九队）在少数民族地区巡回放映。一九五三年还成立了民族电影院。
    全省少数民族地区现在已有卫生院四十八个，分院四个，卫生所二百零九个。人民政府在两年内拨了一百六十四亿元卫生补助专款，为少数民族人民免费医疗和扩充医药器材和药品，有效地帮助了少数民族地区卫生事业的发展。
    医疗防疫是四年来卫生工作的重点，现在基本上已控制了对少数民族人民危害最大的传染病的流行。在少数民族地区蔓延千百年的疟疾、天花、伤寒、痢疾等，现已大为减少。省民族卫生工作队一年多来爬山越岭，走遍了大苗山等十个自治区及南丹等十几个县，免费诊治了各族人民九万二千四百多人。
    在展开医疗防疫工作的同时，还进行了妇幼保健以及爱国卫生运动，训练了接生员、保健员，推行了新接生法，减少了婴儿死亡率，扭转了过去“只见娘怀儿，不见儿行路”的悲惨景象。
