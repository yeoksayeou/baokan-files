Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: Our commentator Jiang Nan commented on the United States' intensified activities to undermine the Geneva Conference, stating: The date for the highly anticipated Geneva Conference is drawing nearer day by day. Peace-loving people all over the world earnestly hope that this first five-power conference with the participation of other relevant countries will reach agreements on the final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, in order to further ease international tensions in the Far East and the world, and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. However, the American warmongering clique, which fears negotiation, fears peace, and is afraid of a world without chaos, is increasingly frantically stirring up fear and war hysteria through a series of clamorous and conspiratorial activities, trying to undermine the conference in order to expand the Indochina war and step up its aggression against the People's Republic of China.

As everyone knows, the United States personally agreed to convene the Geneva Conference at the Berlin Conference. However, since the Berlin Conference, the American ruling clique has been clamoring for war, constantly declaring that the Geneva Conference is not a good thing. Recently, they have been fully engaged in a propaganda campaign and a so-called "diplomatic offensive" aimed at undermining the Geneva Conference and expanding the Indochina war. U.S. President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson, and many reactionary members of Congress have all come out. They are trying their best to fabricate the so-called "threat" of the Soviet Union and China to Southeast Asia, and fabricate rumors and slanders that China is "interfering" in the Indochina war. The purpose of their doing this is to create pretexts for another repetition of the Korean War in Indochina, as Dulles said, in an attempt to invade China and force France, Britain and other countries to take risks with the United States. To achieve this goal, Dulles delivered his third speech on the 7th, continuing to coerce America's allies into accepting and adopting the "united will" and "united action" decided by the United States. On the same day, Eisenhower also made similar remarks again at a press conference. He also publicly suppressed people's desire to restore peace in Indochina. He said that the chances of resolving the Indochina issue through negotiations in Geneva are not great.

According to the U.S. State Department, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles decided to travel from Washington to London and Paris on the 10th to meet with the British and French governments to discuss issues related to the Geneva Conference. News revealed that Dulles's purpose in this trip was to personally coerce Britain and France to issue a "joint statement" on the so-called "joint action" before the Geneva Conference, in order to form "a consolidated Western front" at the Geneva Conference and "pave the way for greater intervention." In fact, it is an attempt to tightly bind the hands and feet of Britain, especially France, with the rope of this "consolidated Western front" of the United States, in order to drag them to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the war together with the United States.

U.S. sources revealed that the U.S. ruling clique is trying to get its allies to provide cannon fodder to support its sinister intentions. According to an International News Service dispatch from Washington on the 6th, the United States has asked its allies to specifically agree on the number of troops they are willing to provide to participate in the Indochina war. Dulles's proposals to Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines are roughly to establish a "Seven-Nation War Committee" composed of the United States and these six countries as soon as possible. In this committee, each country "guarantees to provide troops to participate in an international army. The force will include ground forces, air force units and naval units."

According to U.S. Republican Senator Knowland, the United States wants to use this so-called "international army" to get its allies to "line up" and take the lead for the United States. Knowland also threatened that if anyone does not obey Washington, Washington will stop its "aid" to it.

The recent series of clamors and activities by the American ruling clique are clearly openly opposed to all the good wishes of peace-loving people in the world. The world's kind people know how to deal with this behavior of the American ruling clique which is doing its best to block the path of peace.

    美统治集团加紧战争叫嚣和阴谋活动  企图堵塞日内瓦会议和平协商的道路
    【新华社十一日讯】本社评论员江南就美国加紧破坏日内瓦会议的活动评称：举世瞩目的日内瓦会议召开的日期，一天天地更加临近了。全世界爱好和平的人民，都热切地希望：这个有其他有关国家参加的第一次五大国会议，将在最后和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题上获得协议，以便进一步缓和远东和世界的国际紧张局势，巩固远东和世界和平。但是，害怕协商、害怕和平、唯恐天下不乱的美国好战集团，却正在日益慌乱地通过一连串的叫嚣和阴谋活动，来煽动恐惧心理和战争歇斯底里，力图破坏这个会议，以便扩大印度支那战争，并加紧进行对中华人民共和国的侵略活动。
    大家知道，在柏林会议上，美国是亲自同意要召开日内瓦会议的。但是，从柏林会议以后，美国统治集团却一直在叫嚣战争，一直在叫嚷日内瓦会议不是好事。最近一个时期他们更是全力进行了一个以破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争为目的的宣传运动和所谓“外交攻势”。美国总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿杜勒斯、管理远东事务的副国务卿罗伯逊、以及许多反动的国会议员，都一齐出马。他们竭力捏造苏联和中国对东南亚的所谓“威胁”，并且造谣、诬蔑中国“干预”印度支那战争。他们这样做的目的，就是想制造借口，在印度支那再来一个杜勒斯所说的朝鲜战争的翻版，妄想借此侵略中国，并逼迫法英等国和美国一起进行冒险。为了达到这个目的，杜勒斯在七日又发表了第三次演说，继续胁迫美国的盟国接受并采取美国所决定的“联合意志”和“联合行动”。同一天，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上也再一次发表类似的谈话。他并且公开出面压制人们要求恢复印度支那和平的愿望。他说，在日内瓦通过谈判解决印度支那问题的机会是不大的。
    据美国国务院宣布：美国国务卿杜勒斯决定在十日从华盛顿赶到伦敦和巴黎去，和英法两国政府会谈与日内瓦会议有关的问题。消息透露：杜勒斯此行的目的，是要亲自胁迫英国和法国，在日内瓦会议之前就所谓“联合行动”发表一项“联合声明”，以便在日内瓦会议上形成“一个巩固的西方阵线”，并为“采取更大的干涉行动扫清道路”。实际上，就是企图用美国这条“巩固的西方阵线”的绳索将英国的、特别是法国的手脚紧紧地捆缚起来，以便拖着他们和美国一道破坏日内瓦会议，扩大战争。
    美国消息透露，美国统治集团正在设法要它的盟国出炮灰来支持它的这种罪恶企图。据国际新闻社华盛顿六日电称，美国已经要求它的盟国具体答应它们愿意提供参加印度支那战争的军队的数量。杜勒斯向英、法、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国和菲律宾所提出的建议大致是，及早成立一个由美国及这六个国家组成的“七国战争委员会”，在这个委员会中各国“保证提供军队参加一支国际军。该部队中将包括地面部队、空军部队和海军部队。”
    按照美国共和党参议员诺兰的说法，美国要借这一支所谓的“国际军”来叫它的盟国们“排起队来”，替美国去打头阵。诺兰并且威胁说，谁如果不听从华盛顿，华盛顿就要停止对它的“援助”。
    美国统治集团最近这一连串叫嚣和活动，显然是公开和世界爱好和平人民的一切善良愿望为敌。全世界善良人民对于美国统治集团这种竭力堵塞和平道路的行为是知道如何去对付的。
