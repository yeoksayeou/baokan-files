China Oils and Fats Company Hebei Provincial Company Promptly Supplies Farmers with Peanut Seeds

    In order to solve the difficulties faced by farmers in planting oil crops, the China Oils and Fats Company Hebei Provincial Company promptly supplied farmers with high-quality peanut seeds, laying a solid foundation for increasing oil crop production this year.

    This year, the planting area of oil crops in Hebei Province has been greatly expanded. In addition to cotton seeds increasing by 30 percent compared to last year along with the expansion of cotton fields, the main oil crop, peanuts, alone has increased by 1.1 million mu compared to last year. Among them, Shijiazhuang Prefecture plans to expand the area for peanuts, soybeans, and other oil crops by approximately 100,000 mu, while Tangshan Prefecture will increase the area for peanuts and other oil crops by more than 150,000 mu. It is estimated that this year, Hebei Province's total peanut production can be increased by 36.7 percent compared to last year, and the total oil production can be increased by 76.5 percent compared to last year.
