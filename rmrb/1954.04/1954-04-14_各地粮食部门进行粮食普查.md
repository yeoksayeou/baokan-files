Grain departments in various regions have successively carried out grain censuses before the plum rain season, preparing for summer grain storage work.

In the grain census work, leading organs of grain departments in major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and various provinces generally organized cadres to go deep into the grassroots level for inspection and supervision. Grain departments in East China, Central South China, and other regions also jointly conducted inspections with departments of supervision, cooperatives, etc. The Central Grain Ministry also dispatched cadres in March to East China and Central South China's key provinces and cities for inspection and guidance. The broad masses of grain storage cadres actively participated in the census work. Grain depots in Jianli and Huangpi counties in Hubei Province also launched labor competitions during the census. Currently, about two-thirds of the country has basically completed the grain census and has entered the summary and processing stage; some areas where the census was not thorough enough are conducting re-checks and supplementary lessons.

Through the census, various regions have initially ascertained the grain safety situation and the numbers of scattered grain reserves and warehouses. Grains with high moisture content or showing signs of heating, insect infestation, or mildew have been promptly treated with methods such as turning and sunning, and sifting, so that a large number of grains in dangerous conditions were avoided or suffered less loss. Provinces and cities in the Northwest region have reduced the moisture and temperature of most of the unsafe grain; Shanxi Province has already processed 47,250,000 catties of unsafe grain; twelve special districts in Yunnan Province have turned and sunned more than 11,500,000 catties of damp grain, and the moisture content of grain in Kunyang, Chengjiang, and other counties has generally been reduced from about 15% to below 13.5% after exposure to the sun.

Many grain depots in various regions also put forward the slogan "Learn from the insect-free grain warehouse of Yuhang County" during the census, and carried out warehouse cleaning and sanitation work, removing dust, garbage, pests, etc. inside and outside the warehouses. In Guangdong Province, the grain depots in Zhongshan County alone cleared 160,000 catties of garbage. Yongfeng and Shatin grain depots in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, conducted two to three cleaning sweeps, basically achieving "six sides bright inside the warehouse, three things not left outside the warehouse." Many grain depots in various regions also repaired dilapidated and leaky warehouses, dredged the ditches around the warehouses, and made due preparations for flood prevention work. Through the census, various regions have also rectified and improved many warehouse protection organizations, initially changed the chaotic phenomena such as inconsistencies in grain accounts existing in some grassroots grain depots, and established and improved material management and other systems.

### 各地粮食部门进行粮食普查

    各地粮食部门进行粮食普查
    各地粮食部门在梅雨季节前先后开展了粮食普查工作，为夏季粮食保管工作作好了准备。
    在粮食普查工作中，各大行政区、内蒙古自治区和各省粮食部门领导机关，一般都组织干部深入基层进行了检查、督促，华东、中南等地粮食部门还会同监察、合作社等部门共同进行了检查。中央粮食部也在三月间派出干部，分赴华东、中南重点省、市检查、督导。广大粮食保管干部都积极参加了普查工作。湖北省监利、黄陂等县各粮库并在普查中展开了劳动竞赛。现在，全国已有约三分之二的地区基本上完成了粮食普查工作，转入总结处理阶段；有的普查不够彻底的地区正在进行复查和补课。
    通过普查，各地初步摸清了粮食安全情况及分散的存粮和仓库的数字；对水分大或发热、生虫、发霉的粮，都及时采用翻晒、过筛等办法进行了处理，使大批处于危险状态的粮食避免或少受损失。西北区各省、市已将大部分不安全粮食降低了水分和温度；山西省已经整理了四千七百二十五万斤不安全的粮食；云南省十二个专区共翻晒了潮粮一万一千五百多万斤，昆阳、澄江等县的粮食经过曝晒，水分一般都由百分之十五左右降低到百分之十三点五以下。
    许多地区的粮库并在普查中提出“向余杭县无虫粮仓看齐”的口号，开展了仓库清洁卫生工作，将仓房内外的灰尘、垃圾、害虫等加以清除。广东省仅中山县各粮库就清除了垃圾十六万斤。江西省广丰县永丰、沙田等粮库进行了二至三次的清洁扫除工作，基本上做到了“仓内六面光，仓外三不留”。许多地区的粮库还修葺了残破漏雨的仓房，疏通了仓房周围的水沟，对防汛工作作了应有的准备。各地通过普查还整顿和健全了不少护仓组织，初步改变了某些基层粮库存在的粮账不符等混乱现象，建立和健全了资材管理等制度。
