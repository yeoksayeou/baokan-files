    Guaranteeing the Capital is Protected from Flood Threats
    Yongding River Pangcun Section Stone Embankment Repair Project Begins

    The Yongding River Pangcun section stone embankment repair project, designed to ensure the capital is protected from flood threats, commenced on March 27th. The first phase of the project, excavating the diversion channel, was completed ahead of schedule on April 2nd.

    Looking east from the Yongding River bank near Pangcun in the western suburbs of the capital, one can see the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and many new buildings under construction. These buildings stretch for dozens of miles eastward, connecting with the capital. However, the ground here is many meters lower than the bottom of the Yongding River. Therefore, ensuring the stability of the stone embankment on the east bank of the Yongding River is crucial to protecting the capital from flooding during the flood season.

    The dikes on the east bank of the Yongding River near Pangcun are all stone embankments. Among them, over 300 meters of the embankment have had their foundations exposed above the riverbed due to years of erosion, making them unstable. Last September, a section of the stone embankment, over ten meters long, was breached by floods. It was only through the emergency rescue efforts of mobilized laborers by the Beijing Municipal People's Government that a flood disaster was averted. For this reason, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has adopted a thorough repair plan this year: to excavate another diversion channel in this section, construct a water-blocking earthen dam, temporarily divert the river water, and let it flow downstream through the diversion channel, emptying the original riverbed in the stone embankment section. This will allow the stone embankment to be completely repaired before the flood season. After the completion of the diversion channel project, and once the Guanting Reservoir further controls the flow of the Yongding River, the river water can be released into the diversion channel, and the stone embankment can be completely repaired. This project is expected to be completed by the end of May.

### 保证首都免受洪水威胁  永定河庞村段石堤整修工程开始

    保证首都免受洪水威胁
    永定河庞村段石堤整修工程开始
    保证首都不受洪水威胁的永定河庞村段石堤整修工程，于三月二十七日开始了。第一阶段的挖掘引水河的工程，已于四月二日提前完工。
    从首都西郊庞村附近永定河河岸东望，是石景山钢铁厂，以及正在修建的许多新型的建筑物，这些建筑一直往东绵延数十里，和首都连成了一片。但是这里的地面比永定河的河底还要低许多公尺。所以，确保永定河东岸石堤的牢固，才能使首都在洪水期间免除水患威胁。
    庞村附近永定河东岸堤防都是石堤，其中有三百多公尺长的堤防因年久冲刷，基础浮露在河底以上，已不牢固。去年九月就有十几公尺长一段石堤被洪水冲溃，经北京市人民政府动员民工紧急抢险，才免于水患。为此，今年北京市人民政府采取了彻底整修的方针：在这一段另挖一条引水河，修筑一个拦水土坝，把河水暂时改道，经过引水河向下流，空出石堤段原来的河道，以便在洪水期前完全把石堤整修好。完成引河工程以后，只等上游官厅水库进一步控制了永定河的河水流量，河水就可放入引河，石堤就可完全整修了。这一工程预计在五月底以前就可全部完竣。
