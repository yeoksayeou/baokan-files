    Beijing Private Qian's Pharmaceutical Factory Punished for Manufacturing Substandard Drugs

    Li Jianxun of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce writes: The People's Daily forwarded a letter from Wen Xuan, of the Jiaohe County People's Health院 in Jilin Province (note: this letter was not published in the newspaper), reflecting that after their health院 used the "New Western Beauty" injection solution produced by the Beijing Private Qian's Pharmaceutical Factory, they found that the injected person's skin was red, swollen, and extremely painful. Before and after this, our bureau also received similar reflections from other sources.

    Based on the above situation, our bureau and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau jointly conducted an investigation into the Private Qian's Pharmaceutical Factory recently. The investigation proved that: In order to illegally obtain high profits, the factory consistently manufactured various substandard drugs; especially in processing orders for the state, it more frequently cut corners and used inferior goods to pass off as good ones. Here are the cases of several injection solutions manufactured by the factory for the Beijing branch of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation and the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station:

    When manufacturing "Liver Extract" injection solution, the factory consciously reduced the liver extract concentration to one-fifth of the prescribed concentration. When manufacturing "New Western Beauty" injection solution, its raw materials had already been tested by the Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Testing Institute and proven to be unqualified, but the factory still insisted on making it into finished products. When manufacturing "Rutin" injection solution, the factory simply did not test the raw materials before making it into finished products. The "Calcium Gluconate" injection solution manufactured by the factory was made by modifying "Glucose" injection solution containing pyrogens, which was completely unqualified. More seriously, in order to fraudulently obtain "qualified" certificates, the factory deliberately changed the "batch numbers" (the numbers of each batch of drugs in the test) of the various drugs it produced, disrupting the testing procedures of the testing institutions.

    The result of the factory manufacturing substandard drugs is that, on the user side, either there is no medical effect at all, or the condition is aggravated instead; on the side of state-owned pharmaceutical companies, not only is business credibility affected, but also economic losses are suffered. Based on these facts, our bureau and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau convened a city-wide pharmaceutical industry conference in early March, and gave the factory the deserved punishments such as fines and on-the-spot self-criticism, and have ordered the factory to publish a statement in the newspaper listing the names, batch numbers, and hazards of the various substandard drugs it produced, as well as accepting returns.

### 北京市私营钱氏制药厂制造不合格的药品已受处分

    北京市私营钱氏制药厂制造不合格的药品已受处分
    北京市人民政府工商管理局李建勋来信：人民日报转来吉林省蛟河县人民卫生院文轩同志的来信（按：此信并没有在报上发表），反映他们卫生院使用了北京私营钱氏制药厂所出的“新西美人”注射液后，发现被注射者皮肤红肿，疼痛难忍。在此前后，我局也得到其他方面类似的一些反映。
    根据上述情况，我局和北京市人民政府公共卫生局联合在最近对私营钱氏制药厂进行了调查。调查证明：该厂为了非法获取高额利润，一贯制造各种不合规格的药品；特别是在为国家加工订货中，更经常偷工减料，以劣货充好货。这里举该厂制造中国医药公司北京市公司及天津采购供应站所订购的几种注射剂的情形为例：
    制造“肝精”注射液时，该厂有意识地把肝精浓度比规定浓度缩减了五分之四。制造“新西美人”注射液时，其原料已经北京市制药业联合检验所化验证明不合格，但该厂仍坚持制成成品。制造“露汀”注射剂时，该厂干脆不化验原料就制成成品。该厂制造的“钙固乐”注射剂，则是用含有热原的“葡萄糖”注射液改成的，完全不合规格。更严重的是：该厂为了骗取“化验合格”的证明，竟故意更改所出各种药品的“批号”（每一批药品在化验中的号码），扰乱化验机构的检验程序。
    该厂制造不合规格的药品的结果，在使用者方面，不是全无医疗效果，便是反而加重了病情；在国营医药公司方面，不仅影响到经营威信，还受到经济的损失。根据这些事实，我局和北京市人民政府公共卫生局已在三月上旬召开北京市制药业全体大会，予该厂以罚款、当场检讨等应得的处分，并已令该厂登报声明所出各种不合规格的药品名称、批号、危害性以及接受退货。
