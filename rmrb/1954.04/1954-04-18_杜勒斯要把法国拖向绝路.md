Dulles is Trying to Drag France to Ruin
Wu Quan

After the US-UK talks, Dulles rushed to Paris to meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault and issued a joint communiqué.

Dulles' trip first to London and then to Paris was arranged according to a specific political intention. Its purpose was to force France, through a "fait accompli," to act according to the US's demands to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina War. It also attempted to take over Indochina and push France out of the picture. The French people and patriotic individuals from all walks of life in France clearly see this.

When the United States Information Service released the US-French talks communiqué, it deliberately stated that the communiqué was "roughly the same" as the US-UK talks communiqué. However, it is clear that France will have to pay a disproportionately high price for the "roughly the same" obligations it undertakes.

The US-French talks communiqué stated that France should "rely" on "unity" with the United States to pursue the two countries' "basic objectives at the Geneva Conference." But what are the "basic objectives" of the United States? Recently, Dulles himself has repeatedly and publicly stated that the United States is very afraid that France will, according to its own interests, escape from the quagmire of the colonial war. Although Dulles' adventurous plan to peddle "joint action" in London and Paris failed, their alternative steps are all contrary to the goal of restoring peace in Indochina. It is common knowledge that the US monopoly capitalist groups feel uneasy about any development that is conducive to promoting peace in the Far East and the world. They regard the prosperity brought by war as the only savior to alleviate the US economic crisis. They want to keep the armaments factories from stopping work by relying on war orders in order to continue to maintain maximum profits. To this end, Dulles' "basic objective" is to have France continue to offer the fresh blood of French youth so that US monopoly capitalists can get rich.

At the same time, Dulles has long made no secret of another "basic objective" of the United States in Indochina: to turn Indochina and Southeast Asia into US colonies and military bases. In his speech on March 29, Dulles admitted that the reason why the United States wanted to interfere in the Indochina War was because "Southeast Asia is what is called the 'rice bowl.'" "Southeast Asia is rich in many kinds of raw materials, such as tin, oil, rubber and iron ore." "This region has significant strategic value. Southeast Asia spans the most direct and well-developed sea and air routes between the Pacific and South Asia. It has major naval and air bases." If this region is "lost," then the United States' "entire Western Pacific region, including the so-called 'island chain,' will also be in strategic danger." This clearly shows that the obligations France undertakes for the "basic objectives" can only be a conspiracy to seize Indochina behind it.

It is not difficult to see from this that the so-called "guaranteeing the freedom of the people of Indochina and the independence of the member states of the Federation" in the US-French communiqué is actually an attempt to turn the people of Indochina into war cannon fodder for the United States to take advantage of the fire and seize Indochina and Southeast Asia from France and Britain. Dulles' talk of the freedom of the people of Indochina is shameless. He knows that the struggle of the people of Indochina is to fight for freedom from imperialist colonial rule. He also knows that the United States' attempt to drill into Indochina is to replace France in deepening this colonial rule and lock the people of Indochina under US planes, cannons and dollars. For this reason, they have repeatedly put pressure on France to create the so-called "independence" of the Indochina puppet regime, which is actually to put the puppet regimes into the pockets of the United States. Now, he wants to use this unsavory "independence" as a "political prerequisite" to prevent the Geneva Conference from ending the Indochina War on the basis of guaranteeing peace in Indochina and the national rights of the people of Indochina. He harbors this ulterior motive. Precisely for this reason, the US-French communiqué shows that Dulles opposes ending the Indochina War and is bent on continuing the war; at the same time, he uses the excuse that "the prolongation of the Indochina War not only endangers the security of the countries directly concerned, but also threatens the security of the entire Southeast Asia and Western Pacific region" to force France to participate in the military alliance that the United States is preparing to organize in this region, tying France to the US chariot forever and carrying out new adventures in Asia.

The communiqué tries in vain to cover up the aggressive act of the United States in expanding its interference in the Indochina War and slander the struggle of the people of Indochina for national independence as "aggression." The glorious history of the liberation struggle of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the people of Laos and Cambodia cannot be tainted in the slightest by any historical forgers and aggressors. The war waged by French colonialists in Indochina is condemned by the world as a dirty colonial war. The United States' reaching out more than 14,000 kilometers away to interfere in the Indochina War is an obvious act of aggression. No matter how Dulles tries to reverse black and white, he cannot erase this fact.

It is very clear that the conspiracy activities carried out by Dulles in Paris are intended to lead France to a dead end and are completely contrary to the interests of France. People all over the world are closely watching what policies the French ruling group is prepared to adopt at the Geneva Conference. Undoubtedly, France has a way out, which is to restore France's independent and autonomous foreign policy and seek to restore peace in Indochina in accordance with the will of the French people.

### 杜勒斯要把法国拖向绝路

    杜勒斯要把法国拖向绝路
    吴全
    美英会谈结束后，杜勒斯就赶到巴黎与法国外交部长皮杜尔举行了会谈，也发表了一个联合公报。
    杜勒斯先到伦敦再到巴黎去，这个路程是根据特定的政治意图来安排的，其目的就是要用一种“既成事实”来逼使法国按美国破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的要求办事，并企图借此就接管印度支那，把法国挤下海去。而这一点法国人民和法国各阶层的爱国人士是看得很清楚的。
    美国新闻处发表美法会谈公报的时候，故意说这个公报和美英会谈公报“大致相同”。但是，显然地，法国对它所承担的“大致相同”的义务，不能不要付出难以比较的代价了。
    美法会谈公报说，法国要“取决”于和美国的“团结”来追求两国“在日内瓦会议上的基本目标”。但是，美国的“基本目标”是什么呢？最近以来，杜勒斯自己就已经一再公开表明了，美国十分害怕法国会根据自己的利益，脱出陷于困境中的殖民战争泥坑。杜勒斯带到伦敦和巴黎去兜揽“联合行动”的冒险计划虽然没有得逞，但是，他们的代替的步骤也都是与恢复印度支那和平的目标背道而驰的。人所共见，美国垄断资本集团对于任何有利于促进远东及世界和平的形势的发展，都感到惶惶不安。他们把战争带来的景气，看作是缓和美国经济危机的唯一的救星。他们想靠战争的订货来使军火工厂不致停工，以便继续维持最大限度的利润。为此，杜勒斯的这个“基本目标”就是要法国为了让美国垄断资本家发财而继续奉献法国青年的鲜血。
    同时，杜勒斯也早就毫不掩饰美国在印度支那的另一个“基本目标”是要把印度支那和东南亚地区变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。杜勒斯在三月二十九日的演说中，就承认美国所以要干涉印度支那战争，是因为“东南亚是人们所谓的‘米仓’”。“东南亚盛产许多种原料，诸如锡、石油、橡胶和铁砂等”。“这个地区具有重大的战略价值。东南亚横跨太平洋和南亚之间有最直接和开发得最完善的航海路线和航空路线。它有着主要的海军基地和空军基地。”如果“失掉”了这个地区，那末，美国在“整个西太平洋地区，包括所谓‘大洋岛屿锁链’，也会在战略上陷于危险境地”。这就清楚地说明了法国为“基本目标”而承担的义务，只能是替它背后的僭望者夺取印度支那的阴谋计划了。
    由此不难看出，美法公报所谓的“保障印度支那人民的自由与联邦成员国的独立”实际上就是想把印度支那人民变为美国趁火打劫、从法英手中夺取印度支那和东南亚地区的战争炮灰。杜勒斯说印度支那人民的自由是毫无廉耻的。他明知印度支那人民的斗争是为了从帝国主义殖民统治下争取自由。他也深知美国力图钻进印度支那，就是为了想代替法国来加深这种殖民统治，把印度支那人民锁在美国的飞机、大炮和美元下面。为了这个，他们一再对法国施行压力，制造印度支那傀儡政权的所谓“独立”，实际上就是要把傀儡政权都收进美国的口袋里面去。现在，他却想拿这个见不得人的“独立”来作为“政治前提”，阻挠日内瓦会议在保证印度支那和平与印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上结束印度支那战争。他怀的就是这种不可告人的目的。正因此，美法公报表明杜勒斯反对结束印度支那战争，一心要使战争继续下去；同时则以所谓“印度支那战争的延长不但危及直接有关的国家的安全，而且威胁到整个东南亚和西太平洋地区的安全”为借口，强使法国参加美国准备在这一地区组织的军事联盟，把法国永远绑在美国的战车上，在亚洲进行新的冒险。
    会谈公报力图掩饰美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的侵略行为，诬蔑印度支那人民争取民族独立的斗争是“侵略”，这都是徒然的。越南民主共和国和寮国、高棉人民解放斗争的光荣历史，是任何历史的伪造者和侵略者所不能丝毫污损的。法国殖民主义者在印度支那进行的战争被举世斥责为肮脏的殖民战争。美国伸手到一万四千多公里以外来干涉印度支那战争更是明显的侵略行为。任凭杜勒斯如何颠倒黑白也抹不掉这个事实。
    很显然，杜勒斯在巴黎所进行的阴谋活动，是想使法国走上绝路，是完全违反法国的利益的。全世界人民都在密切注视法国统治集团究竟准备在日内瓦会议上采取什么政策。无疑地，法国是有出路的，这就必须恢复法国的独立自主的外交政策，根据法国人民的意志，谋求恢复印度支那的和平。
