(Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd) According to Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese People's Army launched an attack on the eastern defense line of the French army's Dien Bien Phu group of strongholds on March 30th, achieving new victories.

    A spokesman for the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a statement on March 31st, saying: After destroying the northern defense line of the French army's Dien Bien Phu group of strongholds, the People's Army continued to intensify its encirclement and maintain control of the two airports. At 4:30 PM on March 30th, the People's Army troops, supported by heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns, launched a second attack on the eastern defense line of the French army's Dien Bien Phu group of strongholds. This defense line consisted of five fortified points built on five hills, covering the airport and the eastern passage to the French military headquarters. The enemy attempted to hold it at all costs. The battle continued until 5:00 AM on March 31st, resulting in the complete capture of three fortified points by the People's Army.

    According to preliminary reports, the People's Army has annihilated most of two enemy battalions (one battalion belonging to the Third Algerian Regiment and the other belonging to the Fourth Moroccan Regiment) and part of the reinforcements sent from Muong Thanh. Several enemy ammunition depots were hit by the People's Army's artillery and caught fire. An American-made dive bomber was shot down by the People's Army's anti-aircraft guns.

    (Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd) According to Vietnam News Agency: In two days, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated an enemy motorized battalion and an artillery company on Highway 19 in central and southern Vietnam, and captured the enemy's important stronghold of Thuong An.

    At noon on March 29th, the Vietnamese People's Army ambushed a patrol of the enemy forces defending the Thuong An stronghold on Highway 19 from An Khe to Thuong An, annihilating more than one enemy company, and capturing eleven enemy light and heavy machine guns, one mortar, and one jeep. The People's Army immediately seized the opportunity to surround and attack the enemy's stronghold of Thuong An.

    At 4:00 AM on March 30th, the People's Army completely captured this stronghold and annihilated all the defending enemy. The People's Army captured four 105mm artillery pieces and nearly 400 automatic weapons and rifles.

    Thuong An is an important enemy stronghold located on Highway 19, which the enemy intended to use as a springboard for future attacks on the liberated areas of Binh Dinh province. The enemy forces defending this stronghold were the puppet army's 17th Motorized Battalion and an artillery company.

    据初步消息，人民军已将两营敌军（一营属于第三阿尔及利亚团、另一营属于第四摩洛哥团）的大部分和从芒清派来的援军的一部分歼灭。敌军的几处弹药库被人民军的大炮击中起火。一架美制的俯冲轰炸机被人民军的高射炮击落。
