    The Communist Youth League of Ding County, Hebei Province, convened a meeting of representatives of graduating senior primary school students from the entire county
    The Communist Youth League Committee of Ding County, Hebei Province, convened a meeting of representatives of graduating senior primary school students from the entire county in mid-April, calling on graduating senior primary school students to actively participate in labor production. More than 300 people attended the meeting, including representatives of graduating senior primary school students, representatives of parents, and production models.
    The meeting first conducted general line education for the representatives present, pointing out that developing agricultural production is an important part of China's realization of socialist industrialization, and the future of graduating senior primary school students participating in agricultural production is infinitely bright. The conference also introduced some glorious deeds of graduating senior primary school students participating in production and being welcomed by the masses. For example, Ma Wenying, a 19-year-old female student who graduated from senior primary school last year, actively participated in agricultural labor and is now the captain of the women's production team of the Nanhuitong Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. Qin Zhen, a 23-year-old senior primary school graduate, mobilized 27 farmers to sell more than 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state in last year's grain purchase work, and actively assisted Communist Party members in rural areas in organizing agricultural production cooperatives, which was supported by the farmers and was accepted as a glorious Communist Party member. These glorious deeds gave great encouragement to the representatives of graduating senior primary school students attending the meeting. After group discussions, their ideological awareness has been significantly improved, and they expressed that they would actively participate in production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and contribute to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Many graduating senior primary school students who have already participated in agricultural production also expressed that they will settle down to their work and build the great motherland and their hometowns even more beautiful together with the broad masses of people.
    The conference also received a congratulatory letter from Geng Changsuo, a national agricultural labor model and the director of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei. This letter gave the representatives attending the meeting great education and encouragement. They expressed their determination to learn from Geng Changsuo's noble qualities of being loyal to the Party's cause and loving labor, and to learn from the spirit of the youth of Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative actively participating in agricultural production, so as to achieve greater victories in learning and work in the future.

    青年团河北省定县委员会
    召开全县高小毕业生代表会议
    中国新民主主义青年团河北省定县委员会在四月中旬召开了全县高小毕业生代表会议，号召高小毕业生积极参加劳动生产。参加会议的有高小毕业生代表、学生家长代表、生产模范等共三百多人。
    会议首先对到会代表进行总路线教育，指出发展农业生产是我国实现社会主义工业化的重要环节之一，高小毕业生参加农业生产前途是无限光明的。大会并介绍了一些高小毕业生参加生产受到群众欢迎的光荣事迹。例如去年高小毕业的十九岁女学生马文英，积极参加农业劳动，现在已成为南会同村农业生产合作社妇女生产队队长了。二十三岁的高小毕业生秦祯，在去年购粮工作中动员了二十七户农民把一万多斤余粮卖给国家，还积极协助农村中的共产党员组织农业生产合作社，得到农民们的拥护，并被吸收为光荣的共产党员。这些光荣事迹给予出席会议的高小毕业生代表们很大鼓舞，经过小组讨论，他们的思想觉悟有了显著提高，表示要积极参加生产和互助合作运动，为农业的社会主义改造贡献力量。许多已经参加了农业生产的高小毕业生，也表示要安心自己的工作，和广大人民一道，把伟大的祖国和自己的家乡建设得更加美丽。
    大会还收到了全国农业劳动模范、河北饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社社长耿长锁的一封贺信。这封信使到会的代表受到极大的教育和鼓舞，他们表示决心学习耿长锁那种忠于党的事业、热爱劳动的高贵品质，学习耿长锁农业生产合作社的青年积极参加农业生产的精神，以便将来在学习和工作上取得更大的胜利。  （新华社）
