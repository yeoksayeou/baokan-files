    Shandong Province Concludes Election Work in Areas with 45 Million People
    The grassroots elections in Shandong Province have been basically completed, and hundreds of thousands of outstanding individuals have been elected. As of now, more than 15,000 grassroots units in the province, covering areas with a population of approximately 45 million, have completed their election work. The remaining thousand-plus township (town) grassroots units are also nearing completion.

    Through this election, a large number of activists who led farmers in actively engaging in production, developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and selling surplus grain to support national construction have received the people's love and trust. According to incomplete statistics, in rural areas alone, more than 200,000 outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, mutual aid team leaders, and agricultural production cooperative directors have been elected as people's representatives. The election of these outstanding individuals has further strengthened the connection between the government and the people, and has powerfully promoted the current central tasks. Shandong Province originally had more than 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives last year. After the propaganda and education of the general line and the universal election, more than 14,000 new agricultural production cooperatives have been developed. Mutual aid teams have also greatly developed compared to before. Under the promotion of the universal election, Zekou Township in Laiyang County has newly established two agricultural production cooperatives and 75 mutual aid teams, with organized peasant households accounting for 92% of the total number of households. In cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai, after the universal election, the people's democratic power led by the working class has become more consolidated. Among the 624 representatives elected in Jinan City, 338 are from the working class. Liu Qingxiang, a nationally renowned industrial labor model, and Xiao Fuli, an industrial labor model of Jinan City, were both honorably elected as people's representatives. Zhao Dexi, a female worker from the privately-owned Chengtong Yarn Factory in Jinan City, was also elected as the deputy district head of the Fourth District. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    山东省四千五百万人口地区结束选举工作
    山东省基层选举已基本完成，几十万优秀人物被选举出来。截至目前为止，全省已有一万五千多个基层单位，约四千五百多万人口的地区结束了选举工作，其余一千多个乡（镇）基层单位也即将完成。
    经过这次选举，大批带领农民积极生产，发展互助合作组织，出卖余粮支援国家建设的积极分子受到人民的爱戴和信任。据不完全统计，全省仅农村中便有二十多万优秀的共产党员、青年团员、互助组长和农业生产合作社社长当选为人民代表。由于这些优秀人物的当选，就更加密切了政府和人民的联系，并有力地推动了当前的中心工作。山东省去年原有一千二百多处农业生产合作社，经过总路线和普选的宣传教育，已新发展农业生产合作社一万四千多处。互助组也比以前有很大发展。莱阳县泽口乡在普选的推动下，新建立农业生产合作社两处，互助组七十五个，组织起来的农户占总户数的百分之九十二。在济南、青岛、烟台等城市中，经过普选后，以工人阶级为领导的人民民主政权更加巩固。济南市区被选出的六百二十四名代表中，工人阶级出身的就有三百三十八名。全国著名的工业劳动模范刘庆祥和济南市工业劳动模范萧福利都光荣当选为人民代表。济南市私营成通纱厂的女工赵德喜，还当选为四区的副区长。　（据新华社讯）
