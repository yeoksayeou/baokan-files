Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st. The Central South District Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives held a district-wide production materials supply meeting from March 16th to 25th.

    The meeting reflected that supply and marketing cooperatives in the Central South region have strengthened their business of supplying production materials to farmers this year. According to incomplete statistics up to mid-March, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the region have prepared more than 670,000 tons of various commodity fertilizers, of which more than 93,700 tons have been supplied to farmers; more than 65,000 pieces of various new-style agricultural tools have been prepared, of which more than 44,500 pieces have been supplied; and more than 14 million pieces of various old-style agricultural tools have been prepared, of which 400,000 pieces have been supplied in Henan and Hubei provinces alone. The varieties of production materials managed include fertilizers, agricultural tools, draft animals, seeds, pesticides, medical equipment, raw materials for making agricultural tools such as iron and wood, and feed needed by farmers to raise livestock. In order to do a good job in supplying production materials, cooperatives in Henan Province signed processing and ordering contracts with tens of thousands of handicraft households, and also signed combined contracts for supplying production materials with tens of thousands of farmers' mutual aid and cooperation organizations.
    The meeting believed that although this year's supply plan and the supply volume of various production materials are larger than last year, they still cannot keep up with the increase in farmers' needs. In particular, after farmers have been educated in the general line, they have increased their enthusiasm for production, expanded production investment after selling grain, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed greatly. The demand of mutual aid and cooperation organizations for large agricultural tools and new-style agricultural tools has increased greatly. Therefore, the meeting expanded the original annual plan for the region's cooperatives to manage production materials by more than 32 percent. This plan accounts for 27.89 percent of the region's cooperatives' annual commodity retail sales plan. The meeting believed that the spring plowing is now gradually unfolding throughout the region, and the second quarter is the main production season of the year. Most of the production materials planned to be supplied throughout the year must be supplied to farmers in the second quarter.
    The meeting particularly emphasized doing a good job in supplying commodity fertilizers, because this is an important condition for ensuring increased agricultural production this year. The meeting believed that the commodity fertilizers that cooperatives can currently manage are still far from meeting the needs of farmers, and cooperatives in various places should pay attention to tapping the potential of local commodity fertilizers and opening up sources of commodity fertilizers. The fertilizer sources in the Central South region are rich, such as cottonseed, tea seed, tung seed, wood seed, camphor seed, animal bones, chicken and duck feathers, lime, fire salt, etc. Cottonseed and tea seed, in particular, are large commodities. In addition, the meeting also required all localities to strengthen the management of feed, which is not only to support farmers in raising livestock, but also to partially solve the fertilizer difficulty.

    中南区合作社决定扩大供应农民生产资料
   【新华社武汉一日电】中华全国合作社联合总社中南区办事处在三月十六日到二十五日召开了全区生产资料供应会议。
    会上反映：中南全区供销合作社今年都加强了向农民供应生产资料的业务。据截至三月中旬为止的不完全统计，全区供销合作社已准备各种商品肥料六十七万多吨，已供应农民九万三千七百多吨；已准备各种新式农具六万五千多件，已供应四万四千五百多件；已准备各种旧式农具一千四百多万件，仅河南、湖北两省统计已供应四十万件。经营生产资料的品种包括肥料、农具、耕畜、种籽、农药、药械、造农具的原料铁和木材，以及农民饲养牲畜所需的饲料等。为做好生产资料供应工作，河南全省合作社和几万个手工业户订了加工、订货合同，又和几万个农民的互助合作组织订了供应生产资料的结合合同。
    会议认为：今年的供应计划和各项生产资料的供应量虽然比去年大，但是仍然赶不上农民需要量的增长。特别是农民受到总路线的教育后，提高了生产热情，售粮后扩大了生产投资，互助合作运动有很大发展，互助合作组织对大农具、新式农具的需要量大大增加。因此，会议把全区合作社原订全年经营生产资料的计划扩大了百分之三十二强。这个计划占全区合作社全年商品零售总额计划的百分之二十七点八九。会议认为：现在全区春耕正逐渐展开，第二季度是全年的主要生产季节，全年计划供应的生产资料必须大部在第二季中供应给农民。
    会议特别强调作好供应商品肥料的工作，因为这是保证今年农业增产的重要条件。会议认为：当前合作社能经营的商品肥料距农民需要还远得很，各地合作社应注意挖掘地方性商品肥料的潜力，开辟商品肥源。中南区肥源是丰富的，如棉籽、茶籽、桐籽、木梓、樟籽、兽骨、鸡鸭毛、石灰、火硝等。特别棉籽、茶籽是大宗。另外，会议还要求各地加强饲料的经营，这不仅为了扶持农民饲养家畜，也可以部分解决肥料困难。
