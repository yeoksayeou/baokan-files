    Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory to be Constructed Soon
    Preparatory work for the construction of the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory is being intensified. The state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, newly built this year, is the largest modern textile factory in the Northwest. Its scale is more than twice that of the state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory, which is currently having machinery installed. Once completed, this textile factory will not only produce large quantities of plain cloth and twill to meet market needs, but will also weave more advanced cotton fabrics such as woolen serge and khaki, which have not been woven in the Northwest in the past, in order to meet the ever-increasing needs of the people's living standards.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of this huge project, the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau established a preparatory office as early as last November and launched huge preparatory work before construction. By the end of January, the special railway line leading to the construction site had been laid, and currently, about 100,000 tons of various materials have been transported to the construction site. In order to improve labor efficiency and speed up the project, the main project will also adopt mechanized and factory-based construction. Various mechanical equipment required for mechanized construction—bulldozers, road rollers, cranes, concrete mixers, etc.—have all been ordered, and some have been transported to the construction site. Cement roof panel and triangular beam prefabrication yards, sawmills, and tile kilns have been built and have started producing various products. Temporary dormitories for construction workers and temporary warehouses for storing materials have been largely completed, and some workers have entered the construction site. Construction can begin as soon as the detailed construction drawings arrive.

    西北第四棉纺织厂即将修建
    国营西北第四棉纺织厂施工准备工作正加紧进行。今年新建的国营西北第四棉纺织厂，是西北规模最大的现代化纺织厂。它的规模比目前正在安装机器的国营西北第三棉纺织厂大一倍以上。这座纺织厂建成后，不但能生产大量的平布、斜纹布供应市场需要，并将织造西北过去没有织造过的线哔叽、卡叽等较高级棉织品，以满足人民生活水平不断提高的需要。
    为了保证这一巨大工程顺利进行，西北纺织管理局早在去年十一月间就成立了筹建处。并展开了施工前的巨大准备工作。到元月底通往工地的专用铁路线已铺设完毕，目前已运到工地的各种材料约在十万吨以上。为了提高劳动效率，加快工程速度，主要工程还将采用机械化、工厂化施工。为机械化施工所需用的各种机械设备——推土机、压道机、起重机、混凝土搅拌机等都已订购好，部分已运到工地。水泥屋面板和三角梁预制场、锯木场、制瓦窑已经建成，并已开工生产各种产品。供建筑工人居住的临时宿舍，堆放材料的临时仓库已大部建成，一部工人已进入工地，待施工详图一到，即可开始施工。
