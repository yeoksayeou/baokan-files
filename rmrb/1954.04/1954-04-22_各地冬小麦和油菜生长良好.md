    Winter Wheat and Rapeseed Grow Well in Various Regions
    [Our Newspaper News] Thanks to the universal emphasis on field management work in various regions this year, winter wheat and rapeseed are generally growing well across the country.
    Last winter and this spring, rainfall and snowfall were abundant in Central South, East China, and Northwest China. In late February, there was widespread rainfall in North China, which was extremely beneficial to the growth of wheat seedlings. Most areas seized the opportunity to carry out harrowing, fertilization, and other tasks, and the wheat seedlings generally grew well. As of early April, harvesting has begun in most areas of the Pearl River Basin and the Min River Basin. In the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, wheat has generally headed, and harvesting has begun in a few areas. Except for some areas in Yunnan that have suffered from severe drought, most areas can increase production compared to last year. Wheat seedlings in the Yellow River and Huai River basins have turned green, jointed, and begun to head. Although there were three or four early frosts in Henan Province, they did not cause much damage to the wheat. In Shandong Province, on both sides of the Yellow River, along the Jiaoji Railway, and in coastal areas, the vast majority of seedlings are complete and growing vigorously. Wheat seedlings north of the Huai River in Jiangsu and Anhui are particularly strong and robust. Wheat seedlings in North China and Northwest China are also generally growing very vigorously, and some have begun to head. Recently, some areas have experienced pests and diseases such as wheat spider mites and wheat aphids. Local Party and government organs are leading farmers to actively carry out prevention and control measures, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat.
    The planting area of rapeseed has increased by more than 1.6 million mu compared to last year, mainly in Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces. At present, rapeseed in the Southwest region is generally growing well. Although it was hit by three cold waves in February and March, the impact was not significant, and it is estimated that the harvest will not be lower than last year. In East China, there was widespread rainfall last winter and this spring, and the early rapeseed growth was poor. After the weather cleared up in early March, various regions actively led farmers to strengthen rapeseed field management, and the rapeseed growth situation greatly improved. Harvesting has begun in Fujian Province, and bumper harvests have been achieved in Minhou and other places.
    In the first half of April, most parts of the country experienced widespread rainfall. At present, except for insufficient rainfall in southern Hebei and Shanxi, and severe drought in central and western Yunnan, other areas generally have no drought, which is very beneficial to the growth of wheat and rapeseed, as well as spring plowing and sowing.

    各地冬小麦和油菜生长良好
    【本报讯】由于今年各地普遍重视田间管理工作，全国各地的冬小麦和油菜一般都生长良好。
    去冬今春，中南、华东、西北等地雨雪充沛，二月下旬华北各地又普遍降雨，对麦苗生长极为有利。大部地区都抓紧时机进行耙麦、施肥等工作，麦苗一般生长良好。四月上旬，珠江流域及闽江流域大部地区已开始收割，长江上游一般地区小麦已抽穗，少数地区开始收割，除云南部分地区受旱较重外，大部地区可比去年增产。黄河及淮河流域麦苗已返青拔节开始孕穗，河南省虽有三、四次早霜，对小麦为害不大。山东省黄河两岸、胶济路两侧及沿海地区，绝大部分苗全苗旺。江苏、安徽淮河以北地区麦苗特别壮茁。华北、西北各地麦苗一般也都长得很旺，有的已开始孕穗。最近有些地区发生麦蜘蛛、麦蚜等病虫害，当地党和政府机关正领导农民积极进行防治，争取小麦全面丰收。
    油菜种植面积比去年增加一百六十多万亩，主要在四川、贵州、江苏、安徽等省。目前西南区油菜一般生长良好，二、三月间虽遭三次寒潮侵袭，影响不大，估计收成不致低于去年。华东各地去冬今春普遍多雨，早期油菜生长不佳，三月初天气放晴后，各地积极领导农民加强油菜田间管理，油菜生长情况大大好转。福建省已开始收割，闽侯等地都获丰收。
    四月上半月，全国大部地区普遍降雨，目前除河北、山西南部雨量不足，云南中、西部旱象较重外，其他地区一般无旱象，对小麦、油菜成长和春耕播种都很有利。
