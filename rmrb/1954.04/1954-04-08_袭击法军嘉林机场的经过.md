    The Vietnam News Agency reported the Vietnam People's Army's attack on the French army's Gia Lam Airport on March 4, saying:
    Since the United States has intensified its intervention in the Indochina war of aggression, the French army's air bases in Indochina have also been expanded accordingly. The Gia Lam Airport near Hanoi has been expanded by more than twelve square kilometers, and a large number of farmers' rice fields have been seized to build the airport. The French army has also strengthened the airport's defenses, especially after American planes and pilots arrived in Indochina. Around the airport, the French army installed barbed wire fences as wide as nine meters. The entrances to the airport were heavily guarded with electric fences and landmines. Eight bunkers were set up at the four corners of the airport, equipped with four 75mm caliber cannons. Forty strongholds and observation towers were built around the airport. The French army also dug many machine gun nests on the roads leading to the airport and established seven fortified strongholds within 500 meters of the airport, each stronghold guarded by about a company of European and African troops. Several paratrooper battalions were stationed inside the airport for a long time. At night, thirty-two searchlights illuminated the entire airport, tank units patrolled all night, military dogs were also used for guard duty, and very low-flying helicopters carefully reconnoitered using the searchlights.
    With such defensive measures, the French army was confident that Gia Lam Airport was impregnable.
    On the night of March 4, Vietnamese People's Army soldiers crawled forward for more than two kilometers, inch by inch, in the drizzling rain. They crawled to a place very close to the planes, in front of which were large transport planes newly sent to the French army by the United States, and some transport planes loaded with ammunition and supplies, which were intended for the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu. At this time, the commander called the soldiers to stop, gave them specific instructions, and then issued the order to attack.
    The brave People's Army soldiers rushed towards the planes. The French army sentries only had time to shout "Halt!" before they were shot dead. The soldiers opened fire on nearby tents with submachine guns, causing chaos among the French troops, who were unable to fight back in a hurry. In an instant, the People's Army soldiers bombarded eighteen planes with bombs, and these planes caught fire in a thunderous explosion.
    Five minutes later, when the French army woke up and drove two tanks to the scene, the People's Army had already safely withdrawn.

    袭击法军嘉林机场的经过
   【新华社讯】越南通讯社报道越南人民军三月四日袭击法军嘉林机场的经过说：
    自从美国加紧干涉印度支那侵略战争后，法军在印度支那的空军基地也随着扩大了。河内附近的嘉林机场扩大了十二方公里以上，农民的大批稻田被强占去修建飞机场。法军也同时加强机场的防御，特别是在美国飞机和驾驶员来到印度支那以后。法军在机场的周围，装设了宽达九公尺的带刺的铁丝网，飞机场的入口处重重密布电网和地雷，八个碉堡设在机场的四角，架着四门七十五公厘口径的大炮，在机场周围修筑了四十个据点和了望塔。法军还在通向机场的路上挖了许多机枪掩体，在飞机场外五百公尺以内的地方，建立了七个强固据点，每一个强固据点大约有一连欧非军守卫着。机场内部长期驻扎着几个伞兵营。夜晚，三十二盏探照灯把整个机场照得雪亮，坦克部队整夜巡逻，军用犬也被用来警戒，飞得很低的直升飞机，利用探照灯的亮光仔细在侦察。
    有了这样的防御措施，法军满以为嘉林飞机场是攻不破的。
    三月四日晚上，越南人民军战士在蒙蒙细雨中一寸寸地匍匐前进了两公里多路。他们爬到离飞机很近的地方，面前停着的是美国刚送给法军的大型运输机，和一些满载弹药和供应物资的运输机，那些东西是预备运给奠边府的法国守军的。这时，指挥员招呼战士们停下来，对他们作了具体指示，随即发出攻击的命令。
    英勇的人民军战士们向飞机冲去。守卫的法军哨兵只来得及喊出一声“站住”，就被击毙了。战士们用冲锋枪向附近的帐篷开火，法军大乱，仓卒间无法进行还击。转瞬间，人民军战士用炸弹轰击十八架飞机，这些飞机就在雷鸣般的爆炸声中着火了。
    五分钟以后，当法军清醒过来，开来两辆坦克车到出事地点时，人民军已经安然地撤出了。
