The National United Front of Vietnam Held an Enlarged Meeting of the National Committee
Strongly Protest the U.S. Expanding Intervention in the Indochina War
Express Full Support for the Resolution to Convene the Geneva Conference
[Xinhua News Agency, dated 9th] According to Vietnam News Agency on the 8th: The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front held an enlarged meeting from March 31st to April 2nd.

The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front issued a communique stating: The Enlarged Meeting of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front believes that the resolution to convene the Geneva Conference is a victory for the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and also a victory for the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The meeting expressed full support for this resolution.

The meeting strongly protested against the United States' increasingly expanded intervention in the Indochina war of aggression; and pointed out that the current intervention of U.S. imperialism is the main obstacle to the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue.

The meeting discussed and formulated the tasks and action program of the Vietnam National United Front for 1954, including: implementing the two central tasks of promoting the war of resistance and implementing land reform as stipulated by the government; consolidating and expanding the Vietnam National United Front; consolidating and developing the friendship between the people of Vietnam and the people of fraternal countries, and strengthening the unity between the Vietnamese people and the world's peace and democratic forces.

The meeting passed a resolution in favor of convening the Geneva Conference and decided to launch a nationwide movement against the U.S. intensified intervention in the Indochina war of aggression.

The committee also sent a congratulatory telegram to the Vietnamese People's Army and civilian workers on the Dien Bien Phu front, congratulating them on their glorious achievements.
Indian "The Land" Newspaper Published Commentary
Condemning U.S. Interference in the Internal Affairs of Asian Countries

The Calcutta bourgeois newspaper "The Land" condemned U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries. The newspaper said: "The attitude of the U.S. ruling clique towards Asian countries is as if the entire Asia is their jurisdiction, as if the people of Asian countries do not know what is good or bad, cannot decide what kind of lifestyle to choose, what form of government to establish, and what policies to pursue."

The newspaper continued: "Everyone who opposes U.S. preparation for war, everyone who defends civil liberties, and wants to stop imperialist exploitation is labeled a 'Communist' by the United States. According to Wall Street's vocabulary, the struggles for independence in Indochina and Malaya are communist conspiracies. What these words mean is: the United States cannot tolerate any government in Southeast Asia that it does not like."
Indian "New Age" Newspaper Points Out
The U.S. is Unwilling to Stop the Indochina War

The progressive newspaper "New Age" also emphasized: French public opinion demands an end to the Indochina war, but "French monopoly capitalists and U.S. imperialists are against doing so... It is worth pointing out that U.S. monopoly capitalists own 70 percent of Indochina's mineral resources and 20 percent of its rubber plantations. The United States imports tens of millions of rupees worth of raw materials from Indochina every year. Today, the United States considers Indochina to be a region of strategic value in Southeast Asia, and therefore it opposes a ceasefire most stubbornly."
Indonesian "People's Daily" Published Editorial Pointing Out
The U.S. Should be Responsible for the Indochina Events

Indonesian newspapers commented on issues related to the Geneva Conference, calling on the Indonesian government to make every effort to promote the establishment of peace in Asia.

The "People's Daily" severely condemned U.S. policy in Asia in its editorial on the 8th. The newspaper wrote: "The victory of the Vietnamese people has caused serious unease among the imperialists. Dulles distorted the facts, attempting to prove that it is not the United States, but others who should be responsible for the Indochina events. However, facts speak louder than words. Facts prove that if the United States had not interfered in the Indochina war, peace could have been established there long ago." The "People's Daily" pointed out: The Indonesian people "understand very well the U.S. policy towards Asia." The newspaper said: "A few years ago, when the Dutch used U.S.-made automatic rifles to shoot Indonesians, Indonesia recognized this policy. We will not be fooled. We are very clear that U.S. imperialism threatens the people of Asia. The United States treats the people of Asia as cannon fodder to realize its aggressive plans."
Indonesian "New Newspaper" Points Out
The U.S. is an Intervener in the Indochina War

The "New Newspaper" wrote in its editorial: "The Indochina war is being waged according to the demands of the United States, which is no secret to anyone. The United States is an intervener." The newspaper concluded its editorial by stating: "The people of Asia must decide their own internal affairs. The responsibility of the leaders of Asian countries lies in: extinguishing the flames of war in Asia as soon as possible."
Several French Newspapers Point Out
U.S. Expansion of the War is Not in France's Interests

"Truth Daily" Paris correspondent Lassakin discussed the French newspapers' comments on the U.S. attitude towards the Indochina issue.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's recent speech on the Indochina issue has caused alarm and indignation among the French public.

What is the essence of these speeches? Dulles insisted on continuing the Indochina war, and he stubbornly claimed that this region is "extremely important" to the United States. In order to further entangle France in this hopeless war, the U.S. Secretary of State brandished his claws and fangs, threatening to turn the Indochina war into an international war, trying to use this to cover up the U.S.'s open interference in Indochina affairs. In order to achieve this goal, Dulles spread the myth that the People's Republic of China "interfered" in the Indochina war.

Lassakin said: However, just by looking at the newspapers of France, Britain, Belgium, and Switzerland, it can be known that Washington's warmongering clamor has not received the support of the European continent. These clamors have only caused confusion, panic, and angry protests in Europe.

Several French newspapers oppose those who create panic and instigate war hysteria from across the ocean. For example, the April 6th "Combat Daily" hinted that U.S. diplomats fabricated the claim that the People's Republic of China "interfered" in the Indochina war in an attempt to turn the Indochina war into a so-called "international war," thereby expanding the Indochina war. In addition, French newspaper correspondents in Tokyo also reported that no one there knew about Dulles's claim of Chinese intervention, which clearly shows how untrue the content of the U.S. Secretary of State's speech is.

Lassakin concluded: French newspapers emphasized that the U.S.'s plot to internationalize the Indochina war is contrary to the vital interests of France and other Western European countries.
Belgian "Red Flag" Newspaper Published Commentary
Denouncing Dulles's Warmongering Clamor

The Belgian Communist Party's organ "Red Flag" published a commentary on March 31st, condemning Dulles's speech on March 29th, clamoring for joint aggression against Indochina.

The commentary said: The true meaning of Dulles's so-called "joint action" is to internationalize the war to plunder Indochina. Dulles's speech undermined the chances of success for the upcoming Geneva Conference.

The commentary continued: The Korean War ended just a few months ago, and Dulles wants us to restart the "United Nations War" in Indochina. The U.S. arms dealers and coffin makers see their special source of profit drying up. It seems that we should find them new markets today to sell their products. They will invest in this market with dollars; while we will invest blood.

### 反对美国扩大干预印度支那战争

    反对美国扩大干预印度支那战争
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会举行扩大会议
    强硬抗议美国扩大干涉印度支那战争
    对召开日内瓦会议的决议表示全力支持
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社八日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会在三月三十一日至四月二日举行扩大会议。
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会为此发表公报说：越南国民联合战线全国委员会扩大会议认为，召开日内瓦会议的决议是以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的胜利，也是越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的胜利。会议对这个决议表示全力支持。
    会议强硬抗议美国日益扩大干涉印度支那侵略战争的行动；并指出目前美帝国主义的干涉是和平解决印度支那问题的主要障碍。
    会议讨论和拟定了越南国民联合战线一九五四年的任务和行动纲领，包括：执行政府规定的推进抗战和实行土地改革的两个中心任务；巩固和扩大越南国民联合战线；巩固和发展越南人民和兄弟国家人民的友谊，加强越南人民和世界和平民主力量的团结。
    会议通过赞成召开日内瓦会议的决议，并决定在全国发动一个全国性的反对美国加紧干涉印度支那侵略战争的运动。
    委员会还给奠边府前线的越南人民军和民工拍发贺电，祝贺他们的光辉成就。印度“大地报”发表评论
    谴责美国干涉亚洲国家内政
    加尔各答资产阶级报纸“大地报”谴责美国干涉亚洲各国内政。报纸说：“美国统治集团对待亚洲国家的态度，就好像整个亚洲是它们的管辖地区，就好像亚洲各国人民不识好坏，不能决定选择什么样的生活方式，成立什么形式的政府，奉行什么政策似的。”
    报纸接着说：“一切反对美国准备战争的人，一切维护公民自由，想制止帝国主义剥削的人，都被美国加上了‘共产党’的帽子。按照华尔街的字汇，印度支那和马来亚正在进行的争取独立的斗争是共产党的阴谋。这些话的意思就是：美国不能容忍在东南亚有任何它所不喜欢的政府。”印度“新世纪报”指出
    美国不愿停止印度支那战争
    进步报纸“新世纪报”也着重指出：法国舆论要求停止印度支那的战争，然而“法国垄断资本家和美帝国主义者反对这样做……值得指出的是：美国垄断资本家占有印度支那百分之七十的矿产资源和百分之二十的橡胶种植园。美国每年从印度支那进口的原料达数千万卢比。今天，美国认为印度支那是它在东南亚有战略价值的地区，因此它最蛮横地反对停战。”印尼“人民日报”发表社论指出
    美国应对印度支那事件负责
    印度尼西亚报刊评论与日内瓦会议有关的问题时，要求印度尼西亚政府尽一切努力促使在亚洲建立和平。
    “人民日报”在八日的社论中激烈谴责美国在亚洲的政策。该报写道：“越南人民的胜利引起了帝国主义者的严重的不安。杜勒斯歪曲事实，企图证明：应对印度支那事件负责的不是美国，而是别人。但是，事实是胜于雄辩的。事实证明：如果美国不干涉印度支那战争，那里的和平早就可以建立起来了。”“人民日报”指出：印度尼西亚人民“是很了解美国对亚洲的政策的”。该报说：“几年以前，当荷兰人用美制的自动步枪射杀印尼人时，印度尼西亚就认清了这一政策。我们是不会被瞒住的。我们很清楚，美帝国主义威胁着亚洲人民。美国把亚洲人民当作实现自己的侵略计划的炮灰。”印尼“新报”指出
    美国是印度支那战争的干涉者
    “新报”在社论中写道：“印度支那战争是按照美国的要求进行的，这一点对谁都不是什么秘密，美国是干涉者。”该报在社论结尾指出：“亚洲人民要自己决定自己内部的事务。亚洲各国领导者的责任就在于：尽快地扑灭亚洲的战火。”法国若干报纸指出
    美国扩大战争不合法国利益
    “真理报”驻巴黎记者拉萨金论述了法国报纸关于美国对印度支那问题的态度的评论。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的关于印度支那问题的演说，已经引起了法国公众的惊慌和愤慨。
    这些演说的实质是什么呢？杜勒斯坚持要把印度支那战争继续进行下去，他硬说这个地区对于美国来说“极为重要”。为了要使法国在这场毫无希望的战争里越陷越深，美国国务卿张牙舞爪，扬言要把印度支那的战争变为国际战争，想用这来掩饰美国对于印度支那事务的公开干涉。为了达到这种目的，杜勒斯就散布中华人民共和国“干涉”印度支那战争的神话。
    拉萨金说：然而只要看一看法国、英国、比利时和瑞士的报纸，就可以知道华盛顿好战的叫嚣并没有得到欧洲大陆的支持。这些叫嚣只引起了欧洲的困惑、惊慌和愤怒的抗议。
    法国若干报纸反对大洋彼岸的那些制造惊慌与煽动战争歇斯底里的人们。例如四月六日的“战斗报”就暗示：美国外交官捏造中华人民共和国“干涉”印度支那战争的说法，是企图将印度支那战争变为所谓“国际战争”，借以扩大印度支那战争。此外，法国报纸驻东京记者也报道说，那里并没有人知道杜勒斯所说的中国进行干涉的事情，这就更可以清楚地看出美国国务卿的演说内容是多么不真实了。
    拉萨金最后写道：法国报纸强调指出：美国要使印度支那战争国际化的阴谋，是和法国以及其他西欧国家的切身利益违背的。比利时“红旗报”发表评论
    斥责杜勒斯的好战叫嚣
    比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”在三月三十一日发表评论，谴责杜勒斯三月二十九日发表的叫嚣对印度支那采取联合侵略行动的演说。
    评论说：杜勒斯所谓“联合行动”的真实意义，就是要使掠夺印度支那的战争国际化。杜勒斯的演说损害了就要举行的日内瓦会议成功的机会。
    评论接着说：朝鲜战争结束还不过几个月，杜勒斯又想要我们在印度支那重新开始“联合国战争”了。美国的军火商人和棺材商人看见他们获得利润的特殊泉源枯竭了。我们今天好像应该为他们寻找新的市场，以便推销他们的产品似的。他们将在这个市场上用美元投资；而我们却将投入鲜血。
