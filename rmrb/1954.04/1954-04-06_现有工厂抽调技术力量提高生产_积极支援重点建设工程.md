    Existing Factories Transfer Technical Personnel to Improve Production
    Actively Support Key Construction Projects
    [This newspaper reported] To accelerate the realization of national socialist industrialization, many existing factories are actively supporting key national construction projects.
    Factories such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Dalian Machine Tool Plant have transferred a large number of cadres and technical personnel to support the production and construction of heavy industrial factories in various regions. From January to now, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has transferred more than 320 skilled workers to Benxi, Fushun, Taiyuan, Changchun, Shenyang and other places. These include twelve types of workers, such as fitters, electricians, furnace builders, scaffolders, welders, oxygen welders, forgers, gas workers, rolling workers, excavator drivers and car drivers. This group of skilled workers are all technically excellent, and most of them are technical leaders who serve as captains, squad leaders, and group leaders in Anshan Iron and Steel. They will play a significant role in their new positions. For example, Ma Chunsheng and Qi Xueheng, two gas squad leaders who went to a factory in Fushun, will assist the factory in the acceptance of the gas generator. The two rolling squad leaders who went to Taiyuan Steel Plant have more than ten years of experience in sheet rolling, and they will serve as technical guidance for sheet production. More than two hundred scaffolders and welders who went to Benxi Iron and Steel Company are tasked with helping Benxi Iron and Steel Company complete the urgent task of overhauling a medium-sized blast furnace within a month. Last year, Dalian Machine Tool Plant transferred a group of workers to support the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Recently, it has transferred 36 outstanding cadres and workers to support the construction of Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. These cadres and workers are the backbone of production in Dalian Machine Tool Plant, including workshop directors, foremen, and workers of nine different types of work. More than 60% of them are party members or members of the Communist Youth League, and their technical level is generally high. The transfer of these cadres and workers has brought many difficulties to production work. For example, the external grinding group of the Second Mechanical Workshop transferred nearly one-third of its workers at once, including a group leader, which affected the normal progress of production. However, the leading cadres of the factory realized that actively supporting key construction is the glorious task of existing enterprises, so they overcame all difficulties and transferred them. The transferred employees also actively responded to the call and obeyed the assignment.
    In addition to transferring technical personnel, existing factories are also actively cultivating construction talents for key projects. In the autumn of 1952, Anshan Iron and Steel Company accepted the task of training cadres and technicians for the Daye Iron and Steel Base. In order to help them learn to manage modern enterprises and master modern technology as soon as possible, they were assigned to serve as deputy managers of various engineering companies, deputy site directors, and deputy team leaders in the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel, and participated in mechanical installation, electrical installation, industrial pipeline, furnace construction, civil engineering and other engineering technical work. Most of them also participated in the study of Anshan Iron and Steel Amateur University and other schools according to their educational level. Now, this group of cadres and technicians has begun to leave Anshan one after another at the end of March and return to Central South to undertake the construction tasks of the Daye Iron and Steel Base. After accepting the task of training skilled workers for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Nanjing Automobile Parts and Fittings Plant successively recruited more than 300 high school, junior high school and junior industrial school students and established a skilled worker training class, organizing them to study in two batches according to plan. One batch will first listen to the technical personnel to teach technical theoretical knowledge in the classroom; the other batch will first go to the workshop to learn the operation methods of various types of work such as lathe, casting, fitter, mold, milling, and planer from skilled workers, so as to enable them to fully master the technology. In the third quarter of last year, Nanjing Machine Tool Plant accepted forty junior high school students and demobilized rural cadres sent by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for training. Now, according to the requirements of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, they are assigned to forging, casting, mold, milling and heat treatment workshops and inspection rooms for practical study. In addition, four to six hours a week are set aside for them to take technical classes.
    Many existing factories are working hard to increase production to support the country's heavy industry construction. For example, many local state-owned factories in Baotou City, facing the huge construction task of the Baotou industrial base, are working hard to increase production to support basic construction. This year, the total output value of local state-owned industry in Baotou will increase by more than 24% compared with 1953. In addition to supplying local farmers and herdsmen with means of production and means of living, it will mainly produce a large number of building materials such as bricks, tiles, water pipes, radiators, electromagnets, refractory bricks, and wall brushing powder to meet the needs of basic construction. For example, Baotou Ceramics Factory has determined that it will focus on the production of refractory materials this year, and is preparing to build a large round kiln with a capacity of more than 120 tons, increase machinery and equipment, and expand the production workshop. In this way, only refractory bricks can produce thousands of tons per year to support national construction. Baotou Machinery Factory currently supplies building materials and tools to nearly 30 basic construction units. In January and February this year, the mechanical and fitter workshops produced and repaired dozens of cement mixers and grinders for the drilling teams near Baotou, as well as more than 3,000 pieces of sheaves, core tubes, and various drill bits.

    现有工厂抽调技术力量提高生产
    积极支援重点建设工程
    【本报讯】为了加速实现国家社会主义工业化，许多现有工厂积极支援国家重点建设工程。
    鞍山钢铁公司和大连机床厂等工厂抽调大批干部和技术人才支援各地重工业工厂的生产和建设。从今年一月到现在，鞍山钢铁公司调往本溪、抚顺、太原、长春、沈阳等地的技术工人就有三百二十多名。其中包括钳工、电工、筑炉工、架工、电焊工、氧焊工、锻工、煤气工、压延工、挖土机司机和汽车司机等十二种工种。这一批技术工人在技术上都是优秀的，里面大部分是在鞍钢担任队长、班长和组长的技术领导干部。他们到了新的岗位以后，将发挥很大作用。如到抚顺某厂的马春生和齐学恒两个煤气班长，将协助该厂进行煤气发生炉的验收工作。到太原钢厂的两个压延班长，具有十年以上的薄板压延经验，他们将担任薄板生产的技术指导工作。到本溪钢铁公司的二百多个架工和电焊工等，要在一个月的时间内，帮助本溪钢铁公司完成大修中型炼铁炉的紧急任务。大连机床厂去年输送了一批工人支援第一汽车制造厂的建设，最近又抽调优秀干部和工人三十六人支援哈尔滨量具刃具厂的建设。这批干部和工人都是大连机床厂生产上的骨干，其中有车间主任、工长和九种不同工种的工人，百分之六十以上是党员、团员，技术水平一般也较高。抽调这些干部和工人，曾给生产工作带来许多困难，例如第二机械车间外磨小组这次一下抽调了近三分之一的工人，而且其中还有一个小组长，对生产的正常进行发生了影响；可是厂的领导干部认识到积极支援重点建设是现有企业的光荣任务，因此克服一切困难，把他们抽调出去。被抽调的职工们，也积极响应号召，服从分配。
    现有工厂除了抽调技术力量外，还积极为重点工程培养建设人才。鞍山钢铁公司，在一九五二年秋天，接受了为大冶钢铁基地培养干部和技术人员的任务。为了尽快地帮助他们学会管理现代化企业和掌握现代化技术，曾让他们分别担任了鞍钢基本建设部门的各个工程公司的副经理、工地副主任、工程队副队长等职务，参加机械安装、电气安装、工业管道、筑炉、土木等工程技术工作；大部分人还按照个人的文化程度参加鞍钢业余大学等学校的学习。现在，这批干部和技术人员，已在三月底开始陆续离开鞍山，返回中南，担负大冶钢铁基地的建设任务。南京汽车制配厂接受为第一汽车制造厂培养技术工人的任务后，曾先后招收高中、初中学生和初级工业学校学生三百多人，成立了技术工人训练班，组织他们分成两批按计划进行学习。其中一批将先在课堂听取技术人员讲授技术理论知识；另一批先下车间跟熟练工人实地学习车、铸、钳、模、铣、刨等工种的操作方法，使其全面掌握技术。南京机床厂在去年第三季度接受了第一汽车制造厂送来培养的四十个初中学生和乡村转业干部。现在正按照第一汽车制造厂的要求，分配到锻、铸、模、铣和热处理等车间和检验室实地学习，每星期并抽出四小时到六小时为他们上技术课。
    许多现有工厂正在努力提高生产，配合国家重工业建设。例如面临包头工业基地巨大建设任务的包头市许多地方国营工厂，正在努力提高生产，支援基本建设。今年，包头地方国营工业生产总值将比一九五三年提高百分之二十四以上，除了供应当地农、牧民生产资料和生活资料外，主要将生产大批砖瓦、水管、暖气片、电磁、耐火砖、刷墙粉等建筑器材，供应基本建设需要。如包头造瓷厂确定今年以生产耐火器材为主，并准备建筑容量一百二十余吨的大圆窑，增加机器设备，扩建生产车间。这样，仅耐火砖一项就可年产数千吨，支援国家建设。包头机械厂目前供应近三十个基本建设单位的建筑材料和工具。今年一、二月份内，机工和钳工车间就为包头附近的钻探队生产与修配了水泥搅拌机、砂轮机数十部和滑车、岩心管以及各种牙轮等达三千余件。
