All People's Representatives of the Tangwang Korean Autonomous Region, Tangyuan County
Report on Production and Living Conditions to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

Our Tangwang Korean Autonomous Region in Tangyuan County, Songjiang Province, convened its first People's Representative Conference in late February. All the representatives are excited to tell you about our happy life.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and you, the production and living standards of our Korean people have gradually improved. After the establishment of the Tangwang Korean Autonomous Region in July 1952, our Korean people further enhanced their sense of being masters of the country. Under the leadership of the Party organization and the People's Government of the autonomous region, they are actively creating their own happy life. In agricultural production, we followed your instructions and embarked on the road of "getting organized." By 1953, there were two agricultural production cooperatives, thirty-nine permanent mutual aid teams, and sixty-seven temporary mutual aid teams in the region. The People's Government also helped us improve agricultural technology and promoted advanced cultivation methods such as spot sowing and row sowing. In 1953, the average yield per hectare in the region was 7,900 catties, an increase of more than 25% compared to the past. Our lives have also greatly improved. Before liberation, three or four members of our family would share a tattered quilt, wearing ragged clothes to work in the fields; now, both men and women wear nice calico clothes. There are eight primary schools in the region, and all school-age children have the opportunity to study; in addition, 290 students are studying in middle schools in the region, and more than 300 are studying outside, including two who have gone to university. The People's Government has also sent three full-time cultural instructors to help our farmers improve their cultural level. Now, more than 70% of adult farmers can read the Korean Daily. The farmers in our region have also raised funds to establish a relatively well-equipped clinic. Such a happy life is what we have achieved under the shining ethnic policy and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you.

After studying the general line, we clearly recognized that farmers must transition to socialism through the path of collectivization in order to live a prosperous and happy life. Therefore, the enthusiasm for organizing has become even greater. Seven new agricultural production cooperatives were established in the region this year; mutual aid teams have also greatly improved compared to last year, and they are actively creating conditions to strive for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives as soon as possible. Our entire body of representatives has discussed and decided that, based on last year's bumper harvest, we will increase the yield of each hectare of paddy field by another 200 kilograms of grain this year. Under the light of the general line, with mutual aid and cooperation as the foundation, we will actively carry out technological reforms, and we will surely achieve the goal of a bumper harvest. Everyone is very enthusiastic about production. This year, we have added eighty-four head of draught cattle and more than forty large carts; and we plan to expand the area of paddy fields by one hundred hectares. Now, the farmers in the region are busy transporting manure to the paddy fields, and they have also exchanged more than 200,000 catties of high-quality "Erbaimao" rice seeds. The Agricultural Technology Extension Station will also help us do a good job of spot sowing. We are determined to complete the production increase plan, produce more grain, support national industrial construction, and work together with all ethnic groups to build socialism.

    汤原县汤旺朝鲜族自治区全体人民代表
    向毛主席报告生产和生活情况敬爱的毛主席：
    我们松江汤原县汤旺朝鲜族自治区在二月下旬召开了第一届人民代表大会。全体代表都兴奋地要把我们的幸福生活告诉你。
    解放以来，我们朝鲜族人民在党和您的正确领导下，生产和生活逐步提高。一九五二年七月成立了汤旺朝鲜族自治区后，我们朝鲜族人民进一步提高了国家主人翁的感觉，在自治区的党组织和人民政府的领导下，积极创造着自己的幸福生活。在农业生产上，我们遵照你的指示，走上了“组织起来”的道路。到一九五三年，全区已有农业生产合作社两个，常年互助组三十九个，临时互助组六十七个。人民政府又帮助我们改进了农业技术，推广了点播、条播的先进耕作方法，一九五三年全区每垧地平均打粮七千九百斤，比过去产量提高了百分之二十五以上。我们的生活也大大改善了。解放前，我们三、四口人盖一床破被子，穿着破衣服在地里干活；现在男女都穿上了好布格肩衣服。区里有八所小学，所有的学龄儿童都有了读书的机会；此外，有二百九十名学生在区里念中学，有三百多人在外面上学，其中有二名还上了大学。人民政府还派了三名文化专职教员来帮助我们农民提高文化，现在有百分之七十以上的成年农民都能看朝鲜日报了。我们全区农民还集资办了一个设备比较完善的诊疗所。这样的幸福生活，是我们在中国共产党和您的光辉的民族政策照耀下和正确的领导下争取得来的。
    学习了总路线后，我们明确地认识了农民必须通过合作化的道路才能过渡到社会主义，过上大家富裕的幸福生活，因此组织起来的劲头更大了。全区今年新建了七个农业生产合作社；互助组也比去年大有提高，都积极创造条件争取早日办农业生产合作社。我们全体代表已讨论决定，要在去年丰产的基础上每垧水田今年再增产二百公斤粮食。在总路线的照耀下，有互助合作为基础，我们积极进行技术改革，就一定能达到丰产的目的。大家生产劲头非常高，今年已添置了八十四头耕牛，四十多台大车；并准备扩大水田面积一百垧。现在全区农民正忙着往水田地里送粪、又串换了二十多万斤的二白毛优良品种的稻籽。农业技术推广站还要帮助我们做好点播。我们决心完成增产计划，生产更多的粮食，支援国家工业建设，和各族人民一起为建设社会主义而努力。

              第一届人民代表大会全体代表
