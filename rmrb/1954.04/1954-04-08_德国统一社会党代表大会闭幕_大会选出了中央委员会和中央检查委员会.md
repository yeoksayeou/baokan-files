Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th dispatch from TASS: The Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany concluded in Berlin on April 6th.

    Before closing, the congress adopted a congratulatory telegram from the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The telegram stated: The Soviet government's recognition of the German Democratic Republic as an autonomous state has increased the strength and prestige of the German Democratic Republic. This historically significant decision by the Soviet government encourages German patriots to further strengthen the German Democratic Republic and to continue more resolutely and courageously to fight for the establishment of a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany. The Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany pointed out to all the German people the path to resolving the main issue of the German nation. The congress declared that the main tasks of the Party, the German working class, and all progressive German people are to fight against the revival of German militarism, against the implementation of the Bonn and Paris war treaties, and for the conclusion of an all-European treaty on collective security with Germany's participation. The main task of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is to ensure concerted action by the German working class and to consolidate the alliance between the working class and the working peasants.

    The congratulatory telegram said: The glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our shining example in the struggle to continuously improve the people's living standards, to reunify our motherland in a democratic way, and for the security of Europe.

    Next, the congress heard a report from the Tallying Committee on the results of the election of the Party's leading bodies held on April 6th.
