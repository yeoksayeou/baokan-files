The Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Invites Li Shunda and Others to a Forum on Consolidating and Improving the Experience of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives

On April 7th, Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, all recipients of the 1952 Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal, presented their experiences in consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives at a forum convened by the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Cadres from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Provincial Women's Federation, the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, totaling thirty-two people, attended the meeting. Female labor model Shen Jilan also participated.

At the meeting, the three Gold Star Medal recipients introduced the methods they have adopted in this stage to consolidate and improve agricultural cooperatives. Li Shunda's cooperative has expanded this year to include seven or eight natural villages, and the number of members has increased to 199 households. The work foundation and mass consciousness in these villages are not as good as in Xigou Village, but the whole cooperative has a high morale for unity in production. Li Shunda said: Leading a large cooperative is different from leading a small cooperative in the past. Both new and old members are afraid of being at a disadvantage. First, everyone must be convinced that the agricultural cooperative can fairly and reasonably solve all problems, so that everyone can increase grain production and increase income. Our first step was to reasonably solve the problems in work point assessment and production appraisal. Then, we mobilized the members to build beach land and develop forestry and animal husbandry. This made the members see the superiority of the agricultural cooperative. In particular, we put forward the suggestion of increasing the planting of high-yield crop "Golden Queen Corn" according to local conditions, which made the new members specifically realize that the agricultural cooperative has a way to increase grain yield, which further encouraged their confidence in running the cooperative well. Guo Yu'en introduced his experience in leading the cooperative, which was also to focus on basic land construction and the development of forestry and animal husbandry. This year, their cooperative has planted more than 30,000 trees and plans to build 60 mu of beach land. In addition, many improvements have been made in revising the cooperative's charter and improving financial management, and attention has been paid to educating and uniting poor and middle peasants. Wu Chun'an said: Organizing the economic life of cooperative members in our economic zone is an important task in consolidating the agricultural cooperative. Recently, we mobilized cooperative members to deposit more than 18 million yuan in savings into the bank, and signed supply and marketing contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative, educating the members to spend money in a planned way. Everyone is very satisfied and believes that the cooperative has helped them reduce waste. Shen Jilan also introduced her experience in mobilizing women to participate in production, increasing the cooperative's income, and consolidating the agricultural cooperative.

At the end of the forum, Wang Xiujin, the second deputy minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, stated: The experiences discussed by the three Gold Star Medal recipients have a great guiding role in consolidating and improving agricultural cooperatives. He also hoped that the three Gold Star Medal recipients would guard against arrogance and rashness, diligently study the Party's policies and instructions, and learn from advanced experiences from other places, continue to move forward, and be able to exchange their experiences with other places through newspapers, magazines, and correspondence, and create specific experiences that closely combine agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, to lead farmers in mountainous areas of the province and the country to increase grain and industrial raw material production and support national industrial construction.

    中共山西省委农村工作部邀请李顺达等
    座谈巩固和提高农业生产合作社的经验
    四月七日，一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章获得者李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安三人在中共山西省委农村工作部所召开的座谈会上，介绍巩固和提高农业生产合作社的经验。参加这个会的有省农业厅、省妇联、省团委、省供销合作社等部门干部共三十二人，女劳动模范申纪兰也参加了这个会。
    会上，三个金星奖章获得者都把这阶段巩固和提高农业社所采用的办法介绍出来。李顺达社今年扩展到包括七八个自然村，社员增加到一百九十九户。这些村的工作基础、群众觉悟都比不上西沟村，可是全社团结生产情绪很高。李顺达说：领导大社和从前的小社不一样，新老社员都怕自己吃了亏。首先必须让大家相信农业社能够公道合理地解决一切问题，使大家都增产粮食，增加收入。我们第一步合理地解决了评工评产中的问题。接着发动社员修滩地，发展林牧事业。使社员看到了农业社的优越性。特别是我们根据当地条件提出增种高产作物——金皇后玉米的意见，使新社员具体体会到农业社有办法提高粮食产量，更加鼓舞了办好社的信心。郭玉恩介绍他领导社的经验，同样是抓土地基本建设和发展林牧事业。今年他们社已植树三万多株，还计划修滩地六十亩。另外，在修改社章，改进财务管理上还作了许多改进，并注意教育贫中农团结。吴春安说：在我们经济区组织社员经济生活是巩固农业社的一项重要工作。最近我们发动社员把存款一千八百多万元都存到银行，并和供销社订了供销合同，教育社员有计划的用钱，大家很满意，认为社帮助他们减少了浪费。申纪兰还介绍了她发动妇女参加生产，增加社内收入，巩固农业社的经验。
    座谈结束时，省委农村工作部第二副部长王绣锦表示：三位金星奖章获得者所谈经验，对巩固和提高农业社有很大指导作用，他并希望三位金星奖章获得者戒骄戒傲，刻苦学习党的政策、指示和学习外地先进经验，继续前进，并能通过报纸、杂志以及通信等向外地交流自己的经验，并创造农林牧密切结合的具体经验，带动全省山区和全国农民增产粮食和工业原料，支援国家工业建设。
