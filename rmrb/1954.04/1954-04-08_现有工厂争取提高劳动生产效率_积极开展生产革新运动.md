Existing Factories Strive to Improve Labor Productivity
Actively Launch Production Innovation Campaigns

[This Newspaper] In order to further improve labor productivity, employees of existing factories are enthusiastically launching production innovation campaigns.

    To strive to increase the value of this year's production by 52% compared to last year, with the same equipment and labor force, workers at the state-owned Shenyang Water Pump Factory are enthusiastically carrying out production innovation campaigns. The equipment and factory buildings of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory are relatively old, with old-fashioned belt-driven machine tools accounting for 80% of all equipment, and most of the workers are young workers with less than three years of work experience. This year, the state has assigned them the task of increasing production by 54% compared to 1953; reducing costs by 17.8%; and manufacturing 29 types of products that have never been produced before. In order to fulfill and overfulfill the tasks assigned by the state, at the end of January this year, the factory leadership studied the key issues for improving production efficiency in each workshop and proposed 99 topics, mobilizing all employees to find solutions to these topics. For example, if the machining workshop does not add boring machines this year, the boring work of several thousand water pump brackets will be impossible to carry out. With the help of technicians, the workers converted an old-fashioned belt-driven lathe into a boring machine, making its efficiency twice as high as the original boring machine. Another example is Gu Changshun, a worker from the Han Shuwen group in the sand casting workshop, who proposed changing the molding work of the wrench wheel to semi-mechanization. Other workers learned his method and also changed the molding work of 17 types of parts to semi-mechanization. The core-making workers also followed suit and changed the core-making work to semi-mechanization. In this way, the work tasks that originally required more than 46,500 work hours for the entire group to complete were shortened to only 28,500 work hours. Thus, the entire factory found solutions to the 99 topics in two months. Three advanced groups, including Han Shuwen, have also formulated plans to complete the state's tasks 75 to 140 days ahead of schedule.

    Workers at the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant are actively learning from Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation, transforming production tools, improving operating methods, and increasing production. After studying Wang Chonglun's advanced experience, lathe operators Fang Baowu, Sun Fenglin, and Yan Jiaxun set a production plan to complete the annual workload in five months and twenty-three days. They have already promoted high-speed cutting on the horizontal lathes they use, created new cutting tools, and used the "electric gate jogging method" to increase production efficiency by more than double. In the first two and a half months of this year, they have completed five and a half months of work, and all the product quality, except for one second-grade product, are all first-grade products. The advanced deeds of Fang Baowu and his team have inspired the employees of various factories and mines in Fushun City to actively carry out production innovation. According to the experience of the Fang Baowu team, the first group of the forging workshop of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant found and solved the key to production and set an advanced plan to complete one and a half years of work in one year. The production plan of the sixth shift of the third district of the Fushun Laohutai Mine this year is 52% higher than the actual production level last year. Worker Xiu Fumin and technicians worked together to improve the blasting and filling methods, which can ensure the completion of this year's heavy task one and a half months ahead of schedule.

    In order to carry out production innovation campaigns, the state-owned Chongqing 102 Iron and Steel Plant held symposiums of labor model representatives, a congress of labor models and advanced producer representatives, and opened training courses for production innovators to carry out full ideological education. Labor models and advanced producers participating in the production innovator training courses successively put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals during their studies, which are of great significance to improving production. In order to turn the production innovation campaign into a mass movement, in addition to announcing the sixteen major key issues in the factory's production and mobilizing employees to solve them, the factory leadership also mobilized the Party, the Youth League, and the masses of employees in each workshop. The organization structure for rationalization proposals in the entire factory has also been adjusted as necessary, and full-time engineers have been assigned to handle rationalization proposals. Thanks to these series of measures, the production innovation campaign has been rapidly launched. For example, the Gao Yanming group in the steelmaking workshop proposed extending the melting zone of the pig iron furnace, reducing the carbon consumption rate, increasing the temperature by 70 degrees, and extending the furnace life from 50 furnaces to more than 70 furnaces, greatly improving production efficiency.

    现有工厂争取提高劳动生产效率
    积极开展生产革新运动
      【本报讯】为了进一步提高劳动生产率，现有工厂的职工热烈开展生产革新运动。
    国营沈阳水泵厂职工为争取在原有设备和劳动力的条件下，使今年的生产价值比去年增长百分之五十二，热烈开展生产革新运动。沈阳水泵厂的设备和厂房都比较老旧，老式的皮带机床占全部设备百分之八十，工人大部分是工龄不到三年的青年工人。今年国家交给他们的任务，产量要比一九五三年增加百分之五十四；成本要降低百分之十七点八；还要制造二十九种从未生产过的产品。为了完成和超额完成国家所交给的任务，今年一月底，工厂领导方面研究了各个车间提高生产效率的关键问题，并提出了九十九个课题，发动全厂职工寻找解决这些课题的办法。例如加工车间今年如果不增加镗床，就将有几千台水泵托架的搪孔工作无法进行，工人们在技术人员的帮助下，将一部旧式皮带车床改成镗床，使它的效率比原有的镗床还要高一倍。又如翻砂车间韩述文小组的工人顾长顺提出把扳手轮的造型工作改为半机械化，其他工人学习了他的办法，就把十七种部件的造型工作也改为半机械化了。打芯的工人也跟着将造芯工作改为半机械化。这样就使全组原要四万六千五百多工时才能完成的工作任务，缩短到只要二万八千五百多工时就可以完成。这样，全厂在两个月中就使九十九个课题找到了解决办法。韩述文等三个先进小组并已制订了提前七十五天到一百四十天完成国家任务的计划。
    抚顺重型机器厂工人积极学习王崇伦的生产革新精神，改造生产工具，改进操作方法，提高生产。车工方宝武、孙凤林和阎家训学习王崇伦的先进经验后，订出了用五个月零二十三天的时间完成全年工作量的生产计划。他们已在自己使用的卧式车床上推行了高速切削法，创造出新刀具，并运用了“电门猝行法”使生产效率提高了一倍以上。在今年头两个半月他们已完成了五个半月的工作量，产品质量除一个二级品外，其余全部是一级品。方宝武三人的先进事迹，鼓舞抚顺市各厂矿的职工积极进行生产革新。抚顺重型机器厂锻造车间一段一组根据方宝武小组经验，找出和解决了生产上的关键，订出了一年完成一年半工作量的先进计划。抚顺老虎台矿三区六班，今年生产计划比去年实际生产水平提高百分之五十二，工人修福民和技术人员一起，改进了放炮和充填方法，可以保证提前一个半月完成今年的繁重任务。
    国营重庆一零二钢铁厂为了开展生产革新运动，召开了劳动模范代表座谈会、劳动模范与先进生产者代表大会，开办了生产革新者训练班，进行充分的思想教育工作。参加生产革新者训练班的劳动模范和先进生产者在学习中，先后提出了四十多件合理化建议，这些建议对提高生产有重要意义。为了使生产革新运动变成群众性的运动，工厂领导方面除公布全厂生产上的十六个重大的关键课题发动职工解决外，各车间又分别在党内、团内和职工群众中进行了动员，全厂合理化建议的组织机构，也进行了必要的调整，配备了专职工程师来处理合理化建议。由于采取了这一系列的措施，生产革新运动迅速展开。例如炼钢车间高燕明小组提出了延长化铁炉熔化带的建议，降低了炭耗率，提高了温度七十度，使炉子寿命由五十炉延长到七十多炉，大大地提高了生产效率。
