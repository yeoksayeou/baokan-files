The Northeast region has begun sowing wheat. Farmers in counties such as Tai'an and Panshan in Liaoxi Province, and Huachuan in Songjiang Province, had already completed sowing wheat on over 100 hectares between March 16th and 18th. In Heilongjiang Province, widespread snowfall occurred between March 18th and 19th. After the snow melted, the soil was moist, with the southern counties thawed to a depth of two to three inches, and the eastern counties thawed to about one and a half to two inches. Farmers in more than ten counties, including Longjiang, Zhaodong, and Mingshui, began plowing and sowing one after another. Fourteen state-owned mechanical farms in Heilongjiang Province and farms in Haicheng, Heishan, Tai'an, and other counties have also begun plowing successively.

Prior to sowing, leaders at all levels and agricultural technology extension stations generally summarized experiences in increasing production through early sowing of wheat. On March 7th, Tai'an County convened a meeting of agricultural production cadres and agricultural technology cadres from various districts. After summarizing the experience of increasing production through early sowing of wheat, four agricultural production cooperatives in Huaizipao and Oulituo villages took the lead in plowing and sowing on March 16th. By the 19th, farmers throughout the county had sown nearly 40 hectares of wheat. The agricultural technology extension station in Minquan Village, Suihua County, immediately mobilized the Zhang Qing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinglong Village to start sowing after the thaw. At the same time, they organized farmers to visit, dispelling the concerns of some farmers who believed that "the ground is still frozen and cannot be sown," and started plowing ahead of schedule.

This year, various regions have made relatively sufficient preparations before sowing wheat, paying attention to improving the quality of sowing operations. Two agricultural production cooperatives in Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang City, harrowed the land that had been autumn-plowed and autumn-harrowed again before sowing. During sowing, they used a seeder to carry out trial sowing on flat ground. Based on soil quality, manure, and other conditions, the seeding rate was determined to be 300 to 320 jin per hectare, with 25 carts of base fertilizer and 450 jin of granular fertilizer applied per hectare. Rolling was also carried out in a timely manner after sowing to ensure further improvement in yield.

    东北地区开始播种小麦
    东北部分地区开始种麦。辽西省台安、盘山和松江省桦川等县农民，在三月十六日到十八日间已种完小麦一百多垧；黑龙江省在三月十八日到十九日间普遍降雪，雪融化后土地湿润，南部各县已化冻两三寸深，东部各县也化冻一寸五到两寸左右，龙江、肇东、明水等十多个县部分农民纷纷开犁播种。黑龙江省十四个国营机械农场和海城、黑山、台安等县农场也先后开犁。
    在播种前各级领导和农业技术推广站一般都总结了小麦早种等增产经验。台安县在三月七日召开各区农业生产干部和农业技术干部会，总结小麦早种增产经验后，淮子泡和欧力坨两村四个农业生产合作社，在三月十六日带头开犁播种，到十九日全县农民就种完近四十垧麦子。绥化县民权村农业技术推广站在化冻后，马上动员兴隆村张清农业生产合作社开始播种，同时组织农民参观，打破部分农民认为“现在地冻种不了”的顾虑，提前开犁。
    今年各地在播种小麦以前做了较充分的准备，播种时注意提高播种作业质量。沈阳市郊高坎村两个农业生产合作社，在播种前把去年秋翻秋耙的地又耙了一次，在播种时用播种机在平地上先行试种，根据土质、粪肥等情况，确定播种量每垧为三百到三百二十斤，每垧施基肥二十五车，施用颗粒肥料四百五十斤，播种后又及时进行了镇压，以保证产量进一步提高。
