Your Excellency and Members of the Chinese Delegation:

    Let me congratulate you and the members of your delegation on the successful completion of these negotiations. While thanking you for your kind words, I would like to take this opportunity to formally express my gratitude to your delegation, especially Your Excellency, for the care and cooperation you have shown us, which has made our joint efforts a success.

    For my delegation and me, it is a great honor to be able to hold negotiations with Your Excellency and the members of your delegation on the relations between the governments of India and China in the Tibet region of China.

    I am very honored to be able to lead this delegation from India, and I personally feel very honored as well. Today, the day the negotiations are successfully concluded, is a glorious milestone in the history of friendly relations between our two countries. We firmly believe that the agreement we have signed and the notes we have exchanged will further consolidate the traditional friendship that has existed for centuries between these two great, harmonious neighbors, India and China.

    Since both sides share the same views on friendship, mutual sincerity, and understanding, it is not difficult to reach an agreement on the common principles that guide these negotiations. These great principles have been formally fixed in the agreement. These principles are all heartily agreed upon by both India and China. As for the details, it is true that we spent several months drafting them, but this was due to the nature of the matter, not because of any fundamental differences in our views.

    We have sought in the various agreements we have reached to promote close cultural and commercial relations between India and the Tibetan region of China. We have also accomplished more; we have thoroughly studied the problems existing between our two countries in this region, and have demonstrated to the world, which has been paying close attention to these negotiations, that the two major Asian powers are capable of resolving their mutual problems harmoniously in a spirit of friendship. In this regard, the various agreements we have reached are a symbol and an example worthy of emulation by other countries.

    I hope I am correct in saying that, as a result of the agreement and the notes we have exchanged, our two countries will maintain close cultural and commercial relations in the Tibetan region of China and further develop them to enhance the welfare of the people of both countries.

    The agreement is merely a formal guarantee. What is important is the spirit in which we sought this agreement. Because of our current goodwill towards each other, because we consider each other's welfare, and mutually respect each other's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, our negotiations having concluded satisfactorily today, our cooperation in all aspects of activity between our two countries will be further strengthened. Thus, such cooperation and friendship between us will not only benefit each other, but also be conducive to consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    印度驻华大使赖嘉文在签字仪式上的讲话阁下及中国代表团团员：
    让我祝贺你以及贵代表团的团员，祝贺这次谈判的胜利完成。在感谢你的祝词的同时，我谨趁此机会正式表示感谢贵代表团、特别是阁下给予我们的关怀和合作，这种关怀与合作使得我们的共同努力获得了成功。
    对于我的代表团和我来说，能够和阁下以及贵代表团的团员举行印度政府和中国政府之间关于两国在中国西藏地区的关系的谈判，是很大的荣幸。
    我能够率领这个代表团从印度前来，我个人也感到非常光荣。今天，谈判胜利结束的日子，是我们两国友好关系史上的一个光荣的里程碑。我们坚决相信，我们已经签订的协定和我们已经交换的照会将进一步巩固这两个伟大的、和睦相处的邻国——印度和中国之间已经存在了好几世纪的传统友谊。
    既然我们双方对友谊、彼此的诚意和谅解有同样的看法，那就不难在作为这种谈判的指针的共同原则上获致协议。这些伟大的原则已正式固定在协定中了。这些原则都是印中双方衷心同意的。至于细节，诚然，我们花费了若干月的时间才拟定出来，但这是由于事情的性质所致，而不是因为我们之间的某些见解有什么根本的分歧。
    我们曾经设法在我们业已达成的各项协议中促进印度和中国的西藏地区的紧密的文化及商务关系。我们还完成了更多的工作；我们彻底地研究了在这个地区我们两国之间所存在的问题，并且向一直关心地注意着这次谈判的世界证明了：两个亚洲大国自己是能够融洽地在一种友好的精神下解决他们相互的问题的。在这个方面来看，我们业已达成的各项协议是一个象征，也是足资其他国家效法的一个榜样。
    我希望我这样说是正确的：作为协定和我们交换的照会的结果，我们两国在中国西藏地区将维持密切文化及商务关系并进一步加以发展以增进两国人民的福利。
    协定不过是形式上的保证。重要的是我们在求得这个协定时所本着的精神。由于我们目前相互间的善意，由于我们彼此考虑对方的福利，互相尊重对方的主权、独立和领土完整，我们的谈判今日圆满结束之后，我们两国在各方面活动中的合作必将更进一步加强，这样我们之间这样的合作和友谊将不仅对彼此有利，而且也将有利于巩固亚洲和全世界的和平。
