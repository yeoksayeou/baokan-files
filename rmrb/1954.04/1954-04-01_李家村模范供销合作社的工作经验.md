    The Li Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, was established in April 1949. At that time, it had a share capital of 19 million Northeast Yuan and 997 members. Under the leadership of the Party, after more than four years, by January of this year, the cooperative's capital had increased to 160.94 million Renminbi, and the number of members had increased to more than 2,000, distributed in fifteen natural villages in two administrative villages, accounting for 91.8% of the total population of the two villages. The cooperative was selected as the first-class model supply and marketing cooperative in Heilongjiang Province in 1949, and was selected as the special-class model supply and marketing cooperative in the province for consecutive years in 1951, 1952, and 1953.

    In the past few years, the grain and local products produced by the villagers have basically been sold by the cooperative, and the means of production and living materials that the farmers need to buy have also basically been bought in, thus playing a role as a link between the state-owned economy and the individual peasant economy, and enlivening the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Judging from the actual completion of the supply and marketing plan of the cooperative over the years and the purchasing power survey of typical households, the cooperative has become the economic activity center of the villagers. In 1950, it met 75.9% of the supply and marketing needs of the members (excluding free exchange, the same below), 87.5% in 1951, 90.3% in 1952, and 93% in 1953 (statistics for the first three quarters). Taking 1952 as an example, the total value of products sold for farmers throughout the year was more than 9.336 billion yuan, accounting for 53.9% of the total supply and marketing value. Among them, the value of more than 20 kinds of local products and by-products such as seed kernels, mats, grass bags, wool, copper, iron, rope ends, and various hides reached more than 380 million yuan, accounting for 41.3% of the total sales volume, with an average of more than 176,000 yuan of local products and by-products sold for each person.

    In the past few years, farmers have been most satisfied with the supply of means of production. The cooperative supplied a large amount of fertilizer, seeds, feed, and horses, and closely combined with handicrafts, supplied carts and various iron, wood, and leather farm tools. During the spring ploughing in 1951, 38 horses and 23 carts were purchased for the members. In 1952, the supplied manure could be applied to 620 hectares of land, accounting for 26% of the village's cultivated land area, and more than 11,000 jin of soybean seeds and wheat seeds were supplied. Furthermore, nearly 8,000 jin of wheat and soybean seeds were organized for farmers to exchange among themselves. The total value of means of production was more than 152 million yuan, with an average of 64,000 yuan supplied per hectare. Since the year before last, the cooperative has been engaged in wood processing, repairing carts, replacing cart sheds, making troughs, replacing roller frames, repairing various farm tools, and making doors and windows, etc., which not only sold a large amount of wood, but also solved the difficulties in the production of the members, providing great convenience to the farmers. In the third quarter of last year, the cooperative organized a credit department, absorbed 32 million yuan in deposits, and lent money to 59 households, purchasing a total of 19 horses and 13 carts. Nine households used loans to cure their illnesses, and 13 households used loans to buy farm tools.

    With the purchasing power of the villagers increasing year by year, the variety and quantity of living materials operated by the cooperative have also increased year by year. Taking cloth as an example, 408 pieces were supplied in 1950, and 500 pieces were supplied in the first three quarters of 1953. In 1952, an average of 38 chi of cloth was supplied per person, and 30 chi were supplied per person in the first three quarters of last year.

    Because the cooperative's supply and marketing work is well done, farmers are very satisfied, generally reflecting: "When we are short of this or that in production and life, the cooperative can handle it as soon as we mention it." This is indeed the case. For example, when member Old Su Tou was short of a chaff cutter bed, the cooperative learned about it, bought wood in the street, processed it, and actively sent it to him. When it was time to harvest the land last year, the cooperative learned that ten people in the village used sickles with their left hands, so it bought ten "left-handed" sickles from the street and delivered them to their homes. The members gratefully said: "The cooperative is unparalleled, with the cooperative we can save a lot of labor!"

    Why are farmers satisfied with the supply and marketing work of the Li Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative? The main reason is that the cooperative's supply and marketing work is targeted at the needs of the members and the masses, and resolutely implements the policy of serving the needs of the country, agricultural production, and the lives of farmers. The cadres of the cooperative, especially Comrade Jia Huanzhang, the director of the cooperative, often go deep to understand the needs of the members, and often study the laws of farmers' needs. They know very clearly how many households there are in the village, how many people, how many laborers, how many adults, how many children, how much land in the village, the proportion of various crops planted, how many pigs in the village, how many fat pigs, how many "kelang", how many sows, how many chickens there are, and how many eggs can be produced in a year. When formulating plans, they have a basis for this. Before formulating the plan for each quarter, the cooperative cadres also go deep into various villages to conduct typical household surveys, dividing households into upper, middle, and lower categories according to their economic situation, with three to five households surveyed in each category. After the survey, they convene experienced members who know the situation well to conduct discussions, confirm and correct the situation of the typical households surveyed, and study the main material needs of each person in production and life each quarter. They conduct very detailed investigations, mainly looking for women for living materials and mainly looking for men for means of production. They even calculate how many kerosene lamps each typical household has, how much oil is burned every day, and how much is needed for a month and a quarter. Therefore, the plans they formulate are basically in line with reality.

    When formulating the plan, in addition to conducting typical household surveys, they also mobilize members to submit order forms. They started mobilizing members to submit order forms in the winter of 1949 and have persisted until now, forming a system and becoming a powerful basis for formulating plans. When you ask the male and female members of the Li Village Cooperative: "Can the cooperative know what each family in your village of so many people wants to buy and how much?" The members will tell you: "Comrade! Don't you know! We submit forms to the cooperative!" At the beginning, only cloth, cotton, and salt were submitted on the order forms. In 1951, it increased to more than a dozen kinds. In 1952, not only were supply order forms submitted, but also sales order forms were submitted, such as live pigs, potatoes, and straw. The method of submitting forms is that in addition to the cooperative cadres often going to the countryside to mobilize, it is mainly the responsibility of the directors of each village. Larger villages hold members' group meetings to submit forms, while smaller villages submit forms together. Some village directors even go to each house to ask. The season for submitting the order forms is chosen very appropriately. Living materials such as cloth, cotton, thread, and salt are submitted according to each change of season. For example, before changing clothes in the spring and changing cotton clothes in the autumn, cloth, cotton, and thread are submitted; sea salt is submitted when making big sauce in the spring and pickling pickles in the autumn. The main materials for means of production: pots, forks, large flat milling machines, ploughshares, hoes, hoe blades, and hoe handles, sickles, and scythes are submitted one month before the season of need. For example, sickles are submitted before hanging up the hoe, and scythes are submitted in June of the second quarter. General means of production are submitted monthly. During festivals, things used for the year and festivals are generally submitted. The reason why the order form system of the Li Village Cooperative can be sustained is that the cooperative conscientiously handles matters according to the order forms submitted by the members, trying every means to meet the needs of the members and the masses. Even if only one household in the village needs this commodity, the cooperative will handle it. If it really cannot be handled, the members are immediately informed. The cooperative also keeps abreast of new situations in farmers' needs. Before harvesting the land last year, the cooperative cadres went deep into various villages to find farmers to discuss and understand the number of sickles needed. After learning about it, they found that the number of knives used by farmers was much larger than in previous years, because last year, due to the promotion of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, many women, semi-laborers, and students went to the fields. Based on this situation, members were mobilized to submit order forms, and the cooperative signed contracts with blacksmith shops in advance and handled the matter according to the numbers submitted by the members.

    Whether the cadres of the Li Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative conduct typical household surveys or mobilize members to submit order forms, they closely rely on the cooperation of the members and the masses and attract the members and the masses to care about the cooperative. Because the Li Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative promotes democracy and implements democratic management, the members and the cooperative are united as one, actively caring for and cherishing their own cooperative. In the past few years, the cooperative has conscientiously implemented the democratic management system, giving full play to the role of various democratic management organizations—the board of directors, the board of supervisors, the members' representative meeting, and the members' group meeting. When the cooperative was first established, although various meetings were held regularly, they did not solve many problems. There was no focus at the meeting, there was a lack of preparation, and some directors said, "You can handle it at your discretion, what do we old farmers know!" However, the cooperative cadres often said to the directors: "With so many people in the village, what everyone wants to buy, how much they want to buy, what they want to sell, and how much they want to sell, it is impossible to rely on a few people in the cooperative to do it. The directors and representatives must help. The cooperative belongs to everyone, and everyone must do it." In particular, the cooperative conscientiously implements the matters decided at various democratic management meetings, reports work to the directors and representatives on schedule, clearly explaining which things have been done, how they were done, which things have not been done, why they have not been done, and apologizes to the members and representatives for what should be apologized for. After such a period, the directors and representatives' understanding was gradually changed, their role and responsibility were clarified, and everyone came to the meetings. Even some directors who could not attend the meeting because of something or going out would take the initiative to come to the cooperative to ask: what problems were solved at the meeting, how were they solved, and similarly convey it to the members in the village. Before each meeting, the cooperative also makes full preparations, notifying the directors four or five days in advance of when the meeting will be held, what problems will be solved, and the directors of each village will convene members' meetings before the meeting to mobilize members to submit order forms and give opinions to the cooperative. The main contents of the board of directors are: summing up the work of the previous month, affirming achievements, and finding shortcomings; discussing the purchase plan for major commodities, checking the implementation of the plan; reflecting the opinions of the members, and studying solutions. The board of supervisors meets once a quarter, mainly to check the business situation and the role played by the board of directors. The members' representative meeting is held every half a month to sum up work, check work, announce accounts, and make decisions on major issues such as the appointment and removal of cadres, the increase or decrease of stalls, and what should be promoted and what should be reformed. The cooperative cadres also often go deep into the villages to hold members' symposiums to solicit opinions on the cooperative and publicize the benefits of the cooperative, which has played a great role in raising the awareness of the members and improving their understanding of the cooperative.

    Because the Li Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative organizes supply and marketing according to the needs of the masses, it has basically overcome the phenomena of unsalable goods and stockpiles. There are also very few phenomena of loss and waste, and the use of funds is more reasonable. Among the existing 160 million yuan of funds, fixed assets account for 14% and current assets account for 86%. There are no attached stalls, and most of the funds are used for supply and marketing. Now, in addition to the short-term contracts signed with state-owned stores, there are basically no debts to state-owned stores and higher-level cooperatives. The members and the masses owe 5 million yuan, which will soon be recovered.

    李家村模范供销合作社的工作经验
    阎景春　芮守仁
    黑龙江省肇东县李家村供销合作社，是一九四九年四月成立起来的，当时只有股金东北币一千九百万元，社员九百九十七名，在党的领导下，经过四年多的时间，到今年一月，该社资金已增加到人民币一亿六千零九十四万元，社员增加到两千多名，分布在两个行政村十五个自然屯里，占两个村总人口的百分之九十一点八。该社在一九四九年就被选为黑龙江省一等模范供销合作社，一九五一、一九五二、一九五三年又连年被选为全省特等模范供销合作社。
    几年来全村农民打的粮食和土副产品基本上都由合作社给推销出去了，农民所要买的生产资料和生活资料也基本上都买进来了，因而发挥了国营经济与个体农民经济之间的纽带作用，活跃了城乡物资交流。从合作社历年完成供销计划的实际情况以及典型户购买力调查来看，合作社已成为全村农民的经济活动中心，一九五○年满足社员供销需要的百分之七十五点九（自由交换不在内，下同），一九五一年满足供销需要的百分之八十七点五，一九五二年满足供销需要的百分之九十点三，一九五三年（前三季度统计）满足供销需要的百分之九十三。以一九五二年为例，全年为农民推销的产品总额九十三亿三千六百多万元，占供销总额的百分之五十三点九，其中推销籽仁、席子、草包、羊毛以及铜、铁、绳头、各种皮张二十多种副产品，金额达三亿八千多万元，占推销总额的百分之四十一点三，平均给每人推销了十七万六千多元的土产品和副产品。
    几年来在生产资料供应上农民是最满意的。合作社供应了大量的肥料、籽种、饲料、马匹，并与手工业紧密结合，供应了大车和各种铁、木、皮制农具。一九五一年春耕的时候，给社员买来三十八匹马，二十三台大车。一九五二年供应的粪肥能上六百二十垧地，占全村耕地面积百分之二十六，供应大豆种、小麦种一万一千多斤，又组织农民互相串换小麦、大豆种近八千斤，生产资料总额为一亿五千二百多万元，每垧地平均供应了六万四千元。从前年开始，合作社搞木材加工，修理大车，换车棚，打马槽，换磙框，修理各种农具，打门窗等，不但推销了大量木材，而且解决了社员生产上的困难，给农民以极大的方便。去年第三季度，合作社组织了信用部，吸收了存款三千二百万元，贷给了五十九户，共计买马十九匹，车十三台，九户用贷款治好了病，十三户用贷款买了农具。
    随着全村人民购买力逐年上升，合作社经营的生活资料品种和数量也逐年增加。以布匹来说，一九五○年供应四百零八匹，一九五三年前三个季度就供应了五百匹，一九五二年平均供给每口人三十八尺布，去年前三个季度就供给每人三十尺。
    由于合作社供销搞的好，农民感到非常满意，普遍反映：“我们生产上和生活上要是缺这个少那个的时候，向合作社一提就妥，保管给办来。”的确是这样，比如社员老苏头缺个铡刀床子，合作社了解之后，上街买来木头，加了工，主动给送去；去年要割地的时候，合作社了解到全村有十个人左手使镰刀，于是就从街上办来十把“左抛子”镰刀按家给送去，社员们感激地说：“合作社真没比的，有了合作社可省老工啦！”
    为什么农民对李家村供销社的供销工作感到满意呢？主要是供销社的供销工作针对社员群众的需要，坚决贯彻了为国家和农业生产及农民生活的需要服务的方针。合作社的干部，特别是合作社主任贾焕章同志，他们经常深入了解社员需要，经常研究农民需要的规律。他们对全村有多少户、多少人口、多少劳动力，大人多少，小孩多少，全村多少土地，各种农作物的耕种比重，全村多少猪，肥猪多少，“克郎”多少，母猪多少，有多少鸡，一年能产多少蛋，所有这些，都了解得很清楚，掌握住这些制订计划时就有了根据。每个季度制订计划之前，合作社干部还深入各屯进行典型户调查，照按经济情况分出上、中、下三类户，每类户调查三户至五户，经过调查再召集有经验、心中有数的社员座谈，证实和修正调查来的典型户的情况，研究出每个季度每人的生产、生活上主要物资需要量。他们调查得很细致，生活资料主要是找妇女，生产资料主要是找男人，甚至典型户每户有几个煤油灯，每天点多少油，一个月一个季度需要多少，都给算出来了，因而订出的计划基本上都切合实际。
    制订计划时，除了进行典型户调查外，还发动社员提货单子。他们从一九四九年冬就开始发动社员提货单，一直坚持到现在，并且形成了制度，成为制订计划的有力根据。当你问起李家村社的男女社员：“你们全村这么多人口谁家要买啥，买多少，合作社能知道吗？”社员们就会向你讲：“同志！你不知道啊！我们给合作社提表啊！”开始提货单时只提布、棉花、盐三种。一九五一年增加到十多种，一九五二年不但提供应货单，推销的货单也提了，如活猪、土豆、谷草等。提的方法除了合作社干部经常下乡发动外，主要是由各屯理事负责，大一点的屯开社员小组会提，小的屯大家在一起提，有的屯理事还按家去问。提提货单的季节选择得很适当。生活资料如布、棉花、线、盐等，都是按每个换季的季节提，比如春天换单衣服，秋天换棉衣之前，提布、棉花、线；春天作大酱和秋天腌咸菜的时候提海盐。生产资料上的主要物资：大锅、叉、大板铣、铧子、锄勾、锄板、锄杆、镰刀、钐刀则是在需要季节的头一个月提，比如镰刀是在挂锄前就提，钐刀是在二季度六月份提，一般的生产资料按月提。逢年过节则普遍提年、节用的东西。李家村社的提货单制度所以能够坚持，是因为合作社认真地按着社员提的货单办事，想尽一切办法去满足社员群众的需要，即或是全村只有一户要这种商品的，合作社也给办来，实在办不来的立即告诉社员。合作社也随时掌握农民需要的新情况。去年割地前，合作社干部深入各屯找农民座谈了解需要镰刀数量，经了解之后发现农民用刀数量大大多于往年，因为去年由于推广肇源丰产经验，妇女和半劳动力，学生下地的多，根据这个情况，发动社员提出订货单，合作社则提前与铁匠炉签订了合同，按社员提出的数字办来了。
    李家村供销社干部不论进行典型户调查，以及发动社员提货单子，都是密切依靠社员群众的合作，吸引社员群众对合作社的关心来进行的。由于李家村供销社发扬民主，实行民主管理，因而使社员与合作社拧成了一股绳，积极地关心和爱护自己的合作社。几年来合作社认真地贯彻了民主管理制度，充分发挥了各种民主管理组织——理事会、监事会、社员代表会、社员小组会的作用。合作社刚一成立的时候，虽然也定期召开各种会，但解决问题不大，会上没中心，缺乏准备，开会时你来他不来，有的理事还说：“你们酌量办吧，我们老庄稼人懂得啥！”但由于合作社干部经常向理事们说：
  “全村这么多人口，大家要买啥，买多少，要卖啥，卖多少，光靠合作社几个人干是不行的，得理监事和代表帮助，合作社是大伙的，得大家动手办才行。”特别是合作社把各种民主管理会上决议的事，都认真执行，按期向理事、代表报告工作，讲清楚哪些事办了，怎么办的，哪些事没办，为什么没办，应当向社员、代表做检讨的就检讨。经过这样一个时期以后，逐渐地扭转了理事和代表的认识，明确了自己的作用和责任，每次开会来的也齐了，甚至有些理事因为有事或出门不能参加会时，回来之后都主动到合作社来问：会上解决什么问题，如何解决的，回到屯子里同样向社员进行传达。而合作社在每次开会之前，也都作充分准备，前四、五天就通知理事，什么时间要开会，解决什么问题，各屯理事在开会之前都分别召开社员会，发动社员提货单，给合作社提意见。理事会的主要内容是：总结上月工作，肯定成绩，找出缺点；讨论主要商品品种进货计划，检查计划执行情况；反映社员意见，研究解决。监事会一个季度召开一次，主要是检查经营情况和理事会起的作用。社员代表会半月开一次，总结工作，检查工作，公布账目以及干部任免，增减摊子等应兴应革的大事。合作社干部还经常深入村屯召开社员座谈会，征求对合作社的意见，宣传合作社的好处，这对提高社员觉悟，提高社员对合作社的认识起了很大作用。
    李家村供销社由于根据群众需要，组织供销，基本上克服了脱销和积压的现象。损失浪费的现象也很少，资金使用也较合理。现有的一亿六千多万元资金当中，固定资金占百分之十四，流动资金占百分之八十六，没有附设摊子，资金绝大部分是搞供销，现在除了和国营商店签订的短期合同外，基本上不欠国营商店和上级社的款。社员群众欠款五百万元，也即将收回。
