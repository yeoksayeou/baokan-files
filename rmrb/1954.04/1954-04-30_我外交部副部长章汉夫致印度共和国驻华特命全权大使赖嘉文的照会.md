To His Excellency Mr. N. Raghavan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of India:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency’s Note of April 29, 1954, which reads as follows:

“The negotiations between the Delegation of the Government of the Republic of India and the Delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India have been happily concluded today; in the course of the discussions, both sides have agreed that certain matters should be stipulated by means of an exchange of notes. In accordance with this understanding, the two Governments hereby agree as follows:

(1) The Government of India will gladly withdraw completely the armed escorts now stationed in Yatung and Gyantse in the Tibet Region of China within six months from the date of exchange of these Notes. For this purpose, the Chinese Government will provide facilities and assistance.

(2) The Government of India will gladly hand over to the Chinese Government at a reasonable price the postal, telegraph, and telephone enterprises together with their equipment, which the Government of India runs in the Tibet Region of China. Concrete measures will be discussed and stipulated immediately after the exchange of these Notes by the Indian Embassy in China and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

(3) The Government of India will gladly hand over to the Chinese Government at a reasonable price the twelve rest houses in the Tibet Region of China. Concrete measures will be discussed and stipulated immediately after the exchange of these Notes by the Indian Embassy in China and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese Government agrees to continue to use them as rest houses.

(4) The Chinese Government agrees that the Indian Government may retain the houses within the walls of the Trade Agencies of the Government of India at Yatung and Gyantse in the Tibet Region of China. The Indian Government may also continue to lease land within the walls of the Trade Agencies from the Chinese side. At the same time, the Indian Government agrees that the Trade Agencies of the Chinese Government at Kalimpong and Calcutta may lease land from the Indian side and construct houses for their use. The Chinese Government will, as far as possible, render assistance on the question of houses for the Trade Agency of India at Gartok for its own use. The Indian Government will also, as far as possible, render assistance on the question of houses for the Trade Agency of China at New Delhi for its own use.

(5) The Government of India will gladly hand over to the Chinese Government all the land used or occupied by it outside the walls of the Trade Agency at Yatung.

If the Indian Government has left warehouses or houses on the land returned as mentioned above, and if Indian merchants have left shops, warehouses, or houses on the said land, so that there is still a need to lease land, the Chinese Government agrees to conclude contracts with the Indian Government or Indian merchants separately, in accordance with the land occupied by the warehouses, houses, or shops themselves and the land related to them.

(6) The Trade Agents of both sides may contact nationals of their own country involved in civil or criminal cases in accordance with the laws and regulations of the local government.

(7) The Trade Agents of both sides and the merchants of both sides may employ personnel locally.

(8) The hospitals attached to the Trade Agencies of India in Gyantse and Yatung will still be used for the personnel of the Trade Agencies of India.

(9) The Governments of both sides shall protect the life and property of the merchants and pilgrims of the other side.

(10) The Chinese Government agrees to construct, as far as possible, rest houses along the route from Phulung (Tagra Kots) to Kang Rimpoche (Mount Kailash) and Mapam Tso (Lake Manasarovar) for the use of pilgrims; at the same time, the Indian Government agrees to provide all possible facilities on the Indian side for the use of pilgrims.

(11) The merchants and pilgrims of both sides shall have the facility of hiring means of transportation at normal and reasonable prices.

(12) All three Trade Agencies of both sides may perform their functions throughout the year.

(13) The merchants of both sides may rent houses and warehouses from the other party in accordance with local regulations.

(14) The merchants of both sides may conduct normal trade at the locations stipulated in Article 2 of the Agreement in accordance with local regulations.

(15) Disputes over debts between merchants of both sides shall be handled in accordance with local laws and regulations.”

I, representing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, agree to your Note, and your Note and this reply Note shall constitute an agreement between our two governments, which shall come into effect from the date of exchange of these Notes.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the Ambassador the assurances of my highest consideration.

To His Excellency Mr. N. Raghavan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of India.
