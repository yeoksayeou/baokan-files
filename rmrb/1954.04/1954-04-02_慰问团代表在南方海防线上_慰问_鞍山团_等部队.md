Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The Fifth Sub-Group of the National People's慰问团 (慰问团, roughly: "Comfort and Appreciation Delegation") visited the famous People's Liberation Army unit, the "Anshan Regiment." This regiment participated in the battles to liberate the steel capital, Anshan, twice. During the famous "Anshan-Haicheng Campaign" in May 1946, they cooperated with fraternal units to capture Anshan, earning the glorious title of "Anshan Regiment." In February 1948, they participated in the liberation of Anshan again, turning the city into the people's steel capital forever. In recent years, this unit has been stationed on the southern coastal defense line of the motherland, undertaking arduous defense tasks, and engaging in intensive military training and cultural studies.

Every achievement in the construction of the steel capital, every letter from Anshan Iron and Steel, brings great encouragement to the soldiers. The soldiers of the "Shenshe Mountain Company," who made contributions in the battle to liberate Anshan, said in a letter to all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel: "We are constantly watching Anshan while performing our tasks of guarding the coastal defense and studying politics and culture. The commencement of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel gives us great encouragement. In all our work, we always take you as our example, improve our skills according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and train ourselves to become steel soldiers."

During military training last year, the soldiers put forward the slogan "Learn from Wang Chonglun's selfless labor in building the motherland, to master military techniques well." Some soldiers' arms were swollen from practicing grenade throwing, but they still practiced diligently. They said, "Wang Chonglun painstakingly studies and improves technology to build the motherland. We are defenders of the motherland, and we must also master our skills to defend the construction of the motherland."

After the representatives of the慰问团 visited the "Anshan Regiment" and expressed their condolences to all the commanders and fighters, the soldiers' morale was even higher, and many soldiers expressed their determination to defend the construction of the motherland to the representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Hu Keshi, Deputy Head of the National People's慰问团, Yan Qingti, Deputy Head of the First Sub-Group, and Yang Yucai, a first-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and other representatives of the慰问团, visited a certain island in the South China Sea, far from the mainland, on March 25 to express their condolences to the troops guarding the island.

The慰问meeting was held in a coconut grove. Hu Keshi and Yan Qingti conveyed to the troops guarding the island the concern of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland for them, and reported on the great achievements of the motherland in socialist construction and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. When the soldiers heard that "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are both in good health" and "the economic construction of the motherland is progressing smoothly" and were called "the most beloved people," they excitedly raised their guns and shouted: "Thank Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country for their concern!" "Defend the socialist construction of the motherland!" Wang Congdian, a combat hero who had been awarded four major merits, reported to the慰问团 on their situation in guarding the island and completing various construction tasks.

The representatives of the慰问团 visited the island and held discussions with the soldiers. Yang Yucai, a first-class hero and representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, reported to the soldiers on the process of the Chinese People's Volunteers annihilating the "White Tiger Regiment" of the Lee Seung-man puppet army. Hu Keshi and Yan Qingti had cordial conversations with the soldiers in a garden filled with coral, sea trees, sea pines, and various tropical flowers in full bloom.

Before leaving, the representatives of the island-guarding troops read a solemn oath from all the warriors on the island to the representatives of the慰问团: "We will always be loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the illumination of the lighthouse of the general line, we will turn the island into an impregnable fortress and fight to the end to defend the socialist construction of the motherland."

    慰问团代表在南方海防线上
    慰问“鞍山团”等部队
    据新华社广州电：全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团第五总分团慰问了著名的人民解放军某部“鞍山团”。这个团曾经两次参加解放钢都鞍山的战斗。在一九四六年五月著名的“鞍（山）海（城）战役”中，他们配合兄弟部队攻占了鞍山，获得了
  “鞍山团”的光荣称号。一九四八年二月，他们又一次参加了解放鞍山的战斗，把这座城市永远变成人民的钢都。近几年来，这支部队一直守卫在祖国南方的海防线上，担任着艰巨的守卫任务，并进行了紧张的练兵和文化学习。
    钢都建设的每一项成就，来自鞍钢的每一封信，都给战士们带来极大的鼓舞。曾在解放鞍山战斗中立下功绩的“神社山连”的战士们，在给鞍钢全体职工的信中说：“我们在执行警卫海防任务和政治、文化学习的任务中，时刻都在注视着鞍钢。鞍钢三大工程的开工，给我们极大的鼓舞。我们在一切工作中，总是以你们为榜样，按照毛主席的教导提高我们的本领，锻炼成钢铁的战士。”
    去年练兵中，战士们提出了“学习王崇伦忘我劳动建设祖国的精神，来学好军事技术”的口号。有的战士在练习投弹时，手臂肿了，还照样坚苦地练习。他们说：“王崇伦苦心钻研改进技术，建设祖国。我们是祖国保卫者，也要学好本领来保卫祖国建设。”
    这次慰问团的代表来到“鞍山团”向全体指挥员、战斗员进行慰问后，战士们的情绪更加高涨了，许多战士纷纷向代表们表达自己保卫祖国建设的决心。
    据新华社广州电：全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团副总团长胡克实、第一总分团副团长严庆禔和慰问团代表、志愿军一级英雄杨育才等，在三月二十五日到远离祖国大陆的南海中某海岛，慰问守卫海岛的部队。
    慰问大会在椰子树林中举行。胡克实、严庆禔向守卫海岛的部队传达了毛主席和祖国人民对他们的关怀，并报告了祖国进行社会主义建设和抗美援朝斗争的伟大成就。当战士们听到“毛主席和朱总司令身体都很健康”、“祖国经济建设正顺利地前进”和称呼他们为“最可爱的人”时，都激动地举枪高呼：“感谢毛主席和全国人民的关怀！”“保卫祖国社会主义建设！”守卫海岛部队的代表、曾立四次大功的战斗英雄王从典向慰问团报告了他们守卫海岛和完成各项建设任务的情况。
    慰问团代表参观了海岛，并和战士们进行了座谈。志愿军代表、一级英雄杨育才向战士们报告了志愿军歼灭李承晚伪军“白虎团”的经过。胡克实、严庆禔在砌满珊瑚、海树、海松和盛开着各种热带花卉的花园中，和战士们亲切地谈话。
    临别前，守岛部队的代表向慰问团代表们宣读了全岛勇士们的庄严誓词：“我们永远忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于党和毛主席，在总路线的灯塔照耀下，把海岛变成铜墙铁壁，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗到底。”
