Anshan Iron and Steel Works Medium Rolling Mill, Steel Wire Rope Plant, Welded Steel Pipe Plant, and the newly built Seamless Steel Tube Plant, etc., have completed the national plan for April four days ahead of schedule on the 26th, in the competition to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day.

    In the labor competition, the main content of each old factory and mine is to continue to carry out technological innovation. The Medium Rolling Mill has made new achievements in this regard. Xu Yan-shuang, a worker in the straightening section, created an automatic iron feeder for straightening rolled light steel rails, which has liberated workers from heavy and tense labor, eliminated all accidents caused by manual iron feeding, and improved the efficiency of rolling light iron rails. Now, the workers in the entire section are continuing to study and improve the iron feeders for rolling other products based on this experience.

    鞍钢中型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂等
    提前完成四月份计划迎接“五一”节
    鞍钢中型轧钢厂、钢绳厂、焊接钢管厂与新建的无缝钢管厂等，在迎接“五一”劳动节的竞赛中，已在二十六日提前四天完成了四月份的国家计划。
    在劳动竞赛中，各旧有厂矿都以继续开展技术革新为主要内容。中型轧钢厂在这方面，又取得了新的成就。矫直工段工人徐言双创造了轧制轻钢轨的矫直自动喂铁器，已把工人从繁重紧张的劳动中解放出来，根绝了人力喂铁的一切事故，并提高了轧制轻铁轨的效率。现在全工段的工人，正根据这一经验，继续研究改进轧制其他产品的喂铁器。                       （陆灏、常工）
