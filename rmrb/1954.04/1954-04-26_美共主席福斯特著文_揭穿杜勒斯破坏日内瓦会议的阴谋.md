    U.S. Communist Party Chairman Foster Publishes Article
    Exposing Dulles' Conspiracy to Sabotage Geneva Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 24th] William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on April 20th, titled "Dulles is Sabotaging the Geneva Conference."

    In the article, Foster pointed out that all peace-loving people are now turning their attention to the Geneva Conference, which will be held on April 26th. The purpose of this conference is to end the war in Indochina and establish a lasting peace in Korea. Many people around the world are eagerly hoping that this conference will especially end the dirty war in Indochina.

    However, Wall Street's intentions are completely different from the expectations of the people of all countries for the Geneva Conference. Wall Street's aim is to obstruct the achievement of peace at the conference and to intensify and expand the war. This is what their representative, Dulles, is going to Geneva to do. In fact, even before the conference convened, Dulles was attempting to sabotage the conference by brandishing hydrogen bombs in a threatening manner, issuing ultimatums to the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and engaging in other conspiracies to intensify international tension and antagonism.

    Foster said that many people in France are disgusted with this dirty war and hope to end it at the Geneva Conference. But Wall Street strongly opposes this hope. American big business intends to turn the Indochina war into another Korean war, but on a larger and more brutal scale.

    One of Dulles's conspiracies to sabotage the Geneva Conference and to keep the Indochina war going is his so-called "united front" of ten Asian nations. This plan is completely fraudulent and ridiculous. Of the ten countries that want to deal with Asia's very important issues, only Thailand, the Philippines, and Indochina are in Asia. Altogether, the people ruled by these political swindlers number less than fifty million. Major countries such as China, India, Japan, Burma, Pakistan, and Indonesia are not included in Dulles's plan, not to mention another Asian power, the Soviet Union. In total, the people represented by these excluded countries number no less than 1.2 billion, which is about 24 times the number of people "participating" in Dulles's "Asian united front."

    Foster said: This trick is entirely designed to cover up the conspiracy of the French, British, and American imperialists, especially the American imperialists, to dominate Asia. They want to use this trick to protect their own interests, not the interests of Asia.

    Most of the people of Asia will quickly recognize the imperialist conspiracy hidden behind this shameless organization. The final outcome will be that the Western imperialists will be even more disgraced in Asia.

    Foster said: Workers and ordinary people should resolutely demand that the Geneva Conference achieve peace in Indochina. Despite the war conspiracies of Eisenhower and Dulles, the people of the world still contributed to the realization of the Korean armistice. They will be equally successful in promoting a ceasefire in Indochina.

### 美共主席福斯特著文  揭穿杜勒斯破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋

    美共主席福斯特著文
    揭穿杜勒斯破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特在四月二十日的纽约“工人日报”上发表文章，题为“杜勒斯在破坏日内瓦会议”。
    福斯特在文章中指出，所有爱好和平的人们现在已把目光转向将于四月二十六日在日内瓦举行的会议上。这次会议的目的是要结束印度支那战争和建立巩固的朝鲜和平。全世界的许多人都热烈希望这个会议特别是要结束肮脏的印度支那战争。
    但是，华尔街的打算和各国人民对日内瓦会议的期望完全不同。华尔街的目的是阻挠在会议上实现和平，并要加紧进行和扩大战争。这就是他们的代表——杜勒斯要到日内瓦去干的事情。其实，杜勒斯在会议召开之前就在用耀武扬威地挥舞氢弹、给人民中国和苏联下最后通牒以及进行其他种种加剧国际紧张空气和对立情绪的阴谋，试图使会议流产。
    福斯特说，法国有许多人厌恶这场肮脏的战争，他们希望在日内瓦会议上结束这场战争。但是华尔街人士对于这种希望表示强烈的反对。美国的大企业家打算把印度支那战争变为另一个朝鲜战争，而且是在更庞大更残酷的规模上进行。
    杜勒斯企图破坏日内瓦会议以及使得印度支那战争继续进行的阴谋之一，就是他的所谓亚洲十国“联合阵线”。这个计划完全是冒充名义，非常荒唐可笑。在那十个想要处理亚洲非常重要问题的国家中，只有泰国、菲律宾和印度支那是在亚洲的。总共算起来，在这些国家的政治骗子们统治之下的人民还不到五千万。像中国、印度、日本、缅甸、巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚这些大国，都不在杜勒斯的计划之中，更不用说另一个亚洲大国苏联了。总计起来，这些被排斥的国家所代表的人民不下于十二亿人，即约为“参加”杜勒斯的“亚洲联合阵线”的人民的二十四倍。
    福斯特说：这一套把戏，完全是为了掩盖法、英、美帝国主义者尤其是美帝国主义者统治亚洲的阴谋。它们要用这一套把戏来保护它们自己的利益，而不是保护亚洲的利益。
    亚洲的大部分人民是会很快地认识到隐藏在这种无耻的组织后面的帝国主义阴谋的。最后的结局，将使西方帝国主义者在亚洲更加丢脸。
    福斯特说：工人和一般人民应该坚决要求日内瓦会议获致印度支那的和平。尽管艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯玩弄战争阴谋，全世界的人民大众依然促成了朝鲜停战的实现。他们在促进印度支那的停火方面同样也会获得胜利的。
