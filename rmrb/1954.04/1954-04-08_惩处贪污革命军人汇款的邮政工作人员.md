　　Editor's Note: The following three letters from readers reflect the embezzlement of remittances to revolutionary soldiers by certain postal workers. This heinous behavior obstructs communication between revolutionary soldiers and their families, damages the credibility of the people's postal service, and is intolerable. According to a letter from the Supervisory Office of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications: these three cases have been handled according to law; many similar incidents were discovered and dealt with in various regions last year. This year, the postal and telecommunications departments have decided to make "eliminating corruption and theft" one of their most important tasks. We hope that postal and telecommunications departments in all regions will continue to pay attention to this work, deal with and punish corrupt elements in accordance with the spirit of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Embezzlement", and educate postal workers to be loyal in serving the people, so as to prevent similar phenomena from continuing to occur.

　　Punish Postal Workers Who Embezzle Remittances to Revolutionary Soldiers

　　(I)
　　Reader Ma Xilian writes: I am a convalescing volunteer soldier. In the spring of 1953, I remitted a total of one million yuan, consisting of my accumulated allowances, condolence money, and injury compensation from Korea, through the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau to my home in Jiujianfang Village, Third District, Panshan County, Liaoxi, to help my family through the spring famine. Unexpectedly, communication between me and my family was cut off from then on. I sent more than a dozen letters, but never received a reply. Later, after writing to relatives in a neighboring county to inquire, I discovered that my family had not received my letters or remittances. Later, the Tongxian Post and Telecommunications Bureau sent an official letter to the Panshan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau to investigate, and it was learned that the money had been embezzled by Zhao Guangfu, a postman in the Third District of the Panshan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and all correspondence between me and my family had been withheld by him.
　　After the great Three-Anti Movement, it is intolerable that a staff member of a people's postal organization would dare to embezzle money remitted by volunteer soldiers to their families and withhold letters from volunteer soldiers. I request that the Panshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau promptly return the remittance to my family and give the postman the punishment he deserves.

　　(II)
　　Reader Zhang Yongfeng writes: I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. I am exposing the criminal behavior of individual postmen and the postal agency in Dazhai Village, Eighth District, Zunhua, Hebei Province, who embezzle remittances and engage in speculation and profiteering.
　　Because my hometown was hit by a disaster and my family was experiencing financial difficulties, I sent part of my surplus allowance home in a registered letter last July. Three months passed, and my family received neither the letter nor the money, so they wrote to reproach and complain, which made me very anxious. I wrote six consecutive letters home to inquire, but these letters were also withheld by the postman who embezzled the remittance. My parents became ill with worry because they had not seen my letters for a long time. I only found out about this when I returned home on leave this time.
　　Such embezzlement by postal workers greatly affects the lives of military families and the communication between revolutionary soldiers and their families, and seriously damages the credibility of the people's postal service. The postal and telecommunications departments of Hebei Province should handle this matter seriously.

　　(III)
　　Reader Mao Mingliang writes: Quan Bangqing, of the Longtan agency of the Huayuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hunan Province, has committed serious illegal acts of stealing remittances from revolutionary soldiers. Volunteer soldier Liu Xueqin remitted 360,000 yuan in RMB home from Korea via a single registered letter on June 13th of last year; Quan Bangqing secretly opened the letter, took out the money order, forged a stamp, and fraudulently claimed the remittance at the Huayuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau. On October 14th of last year, volunteer soldier Yang Shengming sent back a single registered letter containing a money order for 200,000 yuan, which was also secretly opened and fraudulently claimed by Quan Bangqing. Long Meiyuan, a family member of a volunteer soldier, whose husband remitted 200,000 yuan from Korea to help the family solve difficulties in spring plowing, was also stolen by Quan Bangqing and used as private shares invested in the Longtan Joint Winery. Later, after investigation by the masses, his criminal behavior was exposed. I suggest that the local people's government recover the stolen money from him and return it to the recipients, and punish him according to law, in order to prevent similar embezzlement from happening again.

### 惩处贪污革命军人汇款的邮政工作人员

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：下面发表的三封读者来信，反映  了某些邮政人员贪污革命军人汇款的情况。  这种罪恶行为，阻隔了革命军人和其家属的联系，损害了人民邮政事业的信誉，是令人不能容忍的。据中央邮电部监察室来信：这三个案件已经依法作了处理；去年各地发现并处理了不少类似的事件，今年邮电部门已决定以“肃清贪污盗窃”作为重要工作之一。希望各地邮电部门经常重视这个工作，对贪污分子依照中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例的精神予以处理和惩办，并对邮政工作人员进行忠实为人民服务的教育，以杜绝类似现象继续发生。    
    惩处贪污革命军人汇款的邮政工作人员
      （一）
    读者马喜连来信：我是一个志愿军休养员。一九五三年春天，我将自己在朝鲜积蓄的津贴费、慰问金、伤员费等共一百万元，由通县邮电局汇往辽西盘山县三区九间房村家里，给家中渡春荒。不料从此以后，我和家中的通信便被隔绝了。我连去了十数封信，一直不见回信。后来经我给邻县亲戚家去信查问，才发现家中并未收到我的信件及汇款。后来通县邮电局用公函向盘山县邮电局追查，才知道这笔款被盘山县邮电局三区邮递员赵广福冒领了，我和家中的来往信件也全数被他扣留了。
    经过伟大的三反运动，作为一个人民邮政机构的工作人员，竟敢冒领志愿军汇给家属的钱，并扣留志愿军家信，这种行为是不能令人容忍的。要求盘山邮电局迅速将汇款交还我家，并给该邮递员以应有的惩处。
      （二）
    读者张勇锋来信：我是人民解放军的一个战士。我向你们揭发河北省遵化邮电局个别邮递员和第八区大寨村邮政代办所贪污汇款、进行投机倒把的罪恶行为。
    因为我的家乡受灾，家庭生活困难，去年七月，我就将节余的一部分津贴费，用保价信寄回家去。时间过了三个月，家中信、钱全没收到，所以来信斥责埋怨，弄得我非常焦急。我接连写了六封家信去询问，这些信也被那个贪污汇款的邮递员扣留了。我的父母因长时间看不到我的信，忧虑得生了病。这次我回家探亲，才弄清了这件事。
    邮政人员这种贪污行为，大大影响了军属的生活以及革命军人与家属的联系，也严重损害了人民邮政事业的信誉。河北省邮电部门应该加以严肃处理。
      （三）
    读者毛明良来信：湖南省花垣邮电局龙潭代办所全邦清，有盗取革命军人汇款的严重违法行为。志愿军战士刘学亲在去年六月十三日由朝鲜用单挂号信汇人民币三十六万元回家；全邦清将信偷偷拆开，取出汇票，伪造图章，到花垣邮电局冒领了汇款。去年十月十四日志愿军战士杨胜明寄回单挂号信一封，内装汇票二十万元，亦被全邦清偷拆冒领。志愿军家属龙妹元的丈夫从朝鲜汇回二十万元，帮助家里解决春耕生产中的困难，也被全邦清偷去用作私人股金投入龙潭联酒坊。后来，经过群众调查，才将他的这些罪恶行为揭发出来。我建议当地人民政府向他追回赃款交还受款人，并依法加以惩治，以杜绝类似贪污行为。
