Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 5th: On the afternoon of April 4th, both sides of the Second Joint Observation Team conducted an on-site investigation and questioned witnesses regarding the armed attack by U.S. armed personnel on the Chinese side's demilitarized zone three kilometers east of Panmunjom on the evening of the 3rd. Multi-faceted evidence conclusively proves this serious U.S. violation of the armistice agreement.

    Xie Mingqi and Qu Yinsheng, two of our civilian police officers who attended to testify, said: On the evening of the 3rd, at approximately 8:50 PM, while they were patrolling on the north bank of a ditch north of Machang-ri and over 800 meters from the Military Demarcation Line, they suddenly saw five people coming from the south bank of the ditch. When they questioned them, these people opened fire. They immediately returned fire, killing one person who fell into the ditch, and captured another U.S. armed person, Kim Jung-geum (formerly translated as Kim Jong-geum).

    The U.S. armed person Kim Jung-geum, who was captured by our side, admitted in front of both sides' personnel that they had carried out this armed attack. He said: At approximately 6:30 PM on April 3rd, two U.S. soldiers led them, five people in total, from their unit's garrison, Banqiao, one kilometer north of Munsan, and departed in a medium-sized truck. At around 7:00 PM, they arrived at the southern edge of the demilitarized zone near Gyeongshik-hyeon-dong, and then dispatched them, five people, to cross the Military Demarcation Line. After crossing the Military Demarcation Line, they arrived at a location three kilometers east of Panmunjom, about 800 meters north of Machang-ri, and encountered our civilian police. They immediately opened fire. In the battle, he was captured, another U.S. armed person, Kim Kyung-rip, was killed, and the remaining three fled back south of the Military Demarcation Line.

    During Kim Jung-geum's testimony, the U.S. chief member questioned him about the addresses of his family and relatives in South Korea. This questioning clearly carried a threatening nature towards the witness. The chief member on the Korean-Chinese side immediately pointed this out.

    Both sides' personnel jointly inspected the body of the U.S. armed person Kim Kyung-rip, who was killed in the ditch. The U.S.-made carbine and grenades he used were abandoned at his feet. Regarding these weapons, the U.S. chief member said, "I have seen that this looks like the same type as those made in America."

    The U.S. members had no reason to deny these facts, nor could they raise any further questions to continue questioning the witnesses, and admitted that the investigation was over.

    Both sides of the Second Joint Observation Team are scheduled to meet on the 5th to submit a report to the Military Armistice Commission regarding the investigation on the 4th.

    联合观察小组双方人员进行现场调查结束
    美方武装人员违反协定越界袭击证据确凿
    【新华社开城五日电】四月四日下午，第二联合观察小组的双方人员对三日晚上发生的美方武装人员向板门店以东三公里的我方非军事区进行武装攻击的事件进行了现场调查，并且询问了证人。多方面的证据都确凿有力地证明了这次美方严重违反停战协定的事件。
    出席作证的我方民政警察谢明歧、瞿银生二人说：三日晚上，八时五十分左右，他们在马场里以北距军事分界线八百多公尺处的一条水渠的北岸上巡逻时，突然发现从水渠的南岸来了五个人。当他们喝问时，这些人就向他们开枪射击。他们当即还击，打死一人倒于水渠中，并且捕获了另一名美方武装人员金正今（前译金钟今）。
    被我方捕获的美方武装人员金正今在双方人员面前承认了他们曾进行这次武装攻击。他说：四月三日下午六时三十分左右，两个美军带领他们五个人由他们部队驻地汶山北一公里的板桥乘一中型卡车出发，七时左右到了景食岘洞附近的非军事区南缘，然后派遣他们五个人越过军事分界线。他们越过军事分界线后，到了板门店以东三公里马场里以北约八百公尺处，与我方民政警察遭遇，他们即开枪射击，在战斗中，他被俘获，另一个美方武装人员金庆立被打死，其余的三人逃回军事分界线以南去了。
    在金正今作证时，美方首席组员曾盘问他的家庭亲属在南朝鲜的住址，这种盘问显然带有对证人的威胁性质，朝中方面首席组员当即予以指出。
    双方人员共同视察了在水渠中被打死的美方武装人员金庆立的尸体，他使用的美造卡宾枪和手榴弹遗弃在他的脚边，关于这些武器，美方首席组员说，“我已看了这像是和美国制造的同一类型。”
    美方组员既没有理由否认这些事实，也提不出什么问题继续询问证人，并承认调查已经结束。
    第二联合观察小组的双方人员定于五日开会，就四日的调查向军事停战委员会提出报告。
