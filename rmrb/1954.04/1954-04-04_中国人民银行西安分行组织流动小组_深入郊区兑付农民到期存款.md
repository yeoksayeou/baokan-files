The People's Bank of China Xi'an Branch Organizes Mobile Teams
    to Go Deep into the Suburbs to Cash Farmers' Matured Deposits
    The People's Bank of China Xi'an Branch promptly organized mobile teams to go deep into the suburbs to cash the matured "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" deposits, which was welcomed by the farmers.
    Farmers in the suburbs of Xi'an actively participated in "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" after selling grain to the state. Now, some deposits have gradually matured. In order to facilitate farmers' withdrawals and promptly invest funds in spring plowing and production, the People's Bank of China Xi'an Branch has formed fifteen mobile cashing teams, which went to the countryside to carry out cashing work, and established two temporary fixed cashing stations outside the east and west Guanshaomen, to facilitate farmers entering and leaving the urban area to withdraw money at any time. Farmers in the suburbs were very satisfied with the bank's cashing service in the countryside. Grandma Jia from the Fourth Township of the Eleventh District was planning to go to the city to withdraw money when the bank's mobile team came to her village to cash deposits. She said with emotion: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, there wouldn't be such a good bank." At the same time, it dispelled some farmers' concerns about "easy deposit and difficult withdrawal," and further promoted rural deposit business.

    中国人民银行西安分行组织流动小组
    深入郊区兑付农民到期存款
    中国人民银行西安分行及时组织流动小组，深入郊区兑付到期的“优待售粮储蓄”存款，受到农民欢迎。
    西安市郊区农民在卖粮给国家后，积极参加“优待售粮储蓄”。现在部分存款已陆续到期，中国人民银行西安分行为便利农民取款，及时地把资金投入春耕生产，曾先后组成了十五个流动兑付小组，分别下乡进行兑付工作，并在东、西关梢门外设立了两个临时固定兑付站，便利出入城关的农民随时支取。郊区农民对银行这样深入乡村进行兑付，非常满意。十一区第四乡的贾老太太正打算进城去取款，银行的流动小组就来到她们的村里进行兑付。她感动地说：“要不是毛主席领导的好，那有这样的好银行。”同时也打消了有些农民怕“存款容易取款难”的顾虑，进一步开展了农村存款业务。
