Henan Province's relevant departments are taking the midge control work seriously and are now mobilizing farmers in areas with midge infestations to prepare for spraying.

The wheat midge is a pest that sucks wheat sap and is a major enemy of increased wheat production. This spring, the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Gongxian Agricultural Technology Extension Station, and other agencies sent personnel to key areas to check the density of wheat midges by examining soil samples and study the emergence time. The results of the inspections in various locations revealed that most of the wheat midges were already active in the topsoil and were pupating successively. It is predicted that adults will emerge in mid-April, lay eggs, and hatch, harming the wheat. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry immediately supplied 260,000 jin of 666 powder free of charge to Luoyang, Xinxiang, and other special districts to conduct large-scale drug spraying experiments as demonstrations for the masses; and dispatched more than 40 cadres and students from Baiquan Agricultural School to Luoyang, Wuyang, Linxian and other counties to assist the masses in prevention and control. In addition, the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives also allocated more than 200,000 jin of 666 powder to various places to support farmers in fighting against insect pests. Now the agricultural technology extension stations in Yanshi, Bo'ai and other counties have convened technical conferences on the prevention and control of wheat midges to exchange experience and impart technology. Farmers are flocking to supply and marketing cooperatives to buy 666 powder in preparation for spraying wheat midges.

    河南省各有关部门协助农民防治吸浆虫
    河南省各有关机关重视除治吸浆虫工作，现正动员有吸浆虫地区的农民，进行喷杀准备工作。
    吸浆虫是一种吸食麦浆的害虫，是小麦增产的大敌之一。今春，河南省人民政府农林厅、巩县农业技术推广站等机关，都曾派人到重点地区，以淘土检查的办法，检查吸浆虫的密度，研究出土的时间。各地检查结果：发现小麦吸浆虫大部已在地表土里活动，并陆续化蛹。预测在四月中旬，将有成虫出现，产卵孵化，危害小麦。农林厅当即无价供给洛阳、新乡等专区二十六万斤六六六粉，重点进行大面积上药剂喷杀的实验，向群众示范；并派遣干部和百泉农校学员四十多人，分赴洛阳、舞阳、林县等县，协助群众进行防治。此外，省合作社联合社也调拨二十多万斤六六六粉至各地，支持农民向虫害作斗争。现在偃师、博爱等县农业技术推广站已召开了防治吸浆虫技术会议，交流经验，传授技术。农民纷纷向供销社买六六六粉，准备喷杀吸浆虫。
