    Workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    Initiate Labor Emulation Drive to Welcome "May Day"
    [This newspaper reported] The entire workforce of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, on the basis of completing the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule, initiated a competition to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day with the condition of over fulfilling the April national plan by twelve hours ahead of schedule.
    In last year's production increase and thrift movement, the entire workforce of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department created 11.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country and won the honorary title of model unit of the entire plant. In the first quarter of this year, they overcame the phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end, basically achieved safe and balanced production, and over fulfilled the first quarter national production plan. The production tasks of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Department in April were to produce high-manganese steel in the first half of the month and open-hearth steel in the second half of the month; the average iron content of the ore for the whole month was 54.07 percent; the average ash content of the coke for the whole month was 13.5 to 14 percent. Based on these conditions, the entire workforce of the No. 1 Blast Furnace put forward the competition targets: 1. Complete the April production plan twelve hours ahead of schedule, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient reaches 0.82; 2. Ensure product quality and eliminate pig iron rejects; 3. Reduce the coke ratio from 0.910 to 0.900 (reducing coke consumption by 10 kilograms per ton of pig iron), and ensure cost reduction; 4. Ensure safety and eliminate personal and equipment accidents.
    In order to ensure the realization of the above four targets, they put forward four specific methods: 1. Promote advanced experiences such as the Soviet blast furnace top regulation method and ore classification into the furnace; 2. Conscientiously implement the "one-chief system" in the production area; 3. Strengthen equipment maintenance, shorten minor repair time, and ensure repair quality; 4. Do a good job in the maintenance of the tapping spout, improve the qualification rate of the tapping spout depth and the full wind plugging rate.
    After the entire workforce of the No. 1 Blast Furnace put forward this competition slogan on April 3, it received the support and help of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in the entire plant and workshop, especially the engineering and technical personnel actively helped them to specifically study and formulate the competition conditions. The next day, the Party branch of the No. 1 Blast Furnace convened a meeting of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and production backbone members to further discuss it in depth. Everyone had high confidence and unanimously stated: "In the second year of the motherland's Five-Year Construction Plan, we are willing to work harder and produce one more ton of iron together with the workers of fraternal factories and mines across the country to support the 141 projects." Various production teams of the No. 1 Blast Furnace: the model unit of the entire plant – the No. 1 Blast Furnace duty room production team, the important production unit – the tapping spout team, the raw materials charging production team which has made great progress since this year, the North China industrial model team – the Li Youzhi team, the workshop advanced team – the water watching team, the repair workshop that has won six consecutive victories since this year, and production teams such as the furnace front and slag removal have all set out guarantee conditions. They not only proposed to ensure the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions, implement advanced operating methods, and implement the responsibility system, but also put forward specific and vivid slogans. For example, the raw materials charging production team put forward: ensure to achieve three fasts (crane room material pulling fast, trench loading and unloading fast, conveyor belt coal supply fast), five accurates (accurate quantity, accurate material line, accurate bin number, accurate order, accurate material approval), and one safety (personal and machine safety). From April 3, the workers of each team have been working hard to over fulfill this plan.

    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉职工
    发起劳动竞赛迎接“五一”
    【本报讯】　北京石景山钢铁厂炼铁部第一高炉全体职工，在提前完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，以提前十二小时超额完成四月份国家计划的条件，发起了迎接“五一”国际劳动节的竞赛。
    炼铁部第一高炉全体职工，在去年增产节约运动中，为国家创造了一百一十七亿元的财富，获得全厂模范单位的光荣称号。今年第一季度又克服了前松后紧的现象，基本上做到了安全均衡生产，超额完成了第一季度国家生产计划。炼铁部第一高炉四月份的生产任务，前半月生产高锰炼钢铁，后半月生产平炉炼钢铁；矿石含铁量全月平均百分之五十四点零七；焦炭灰分全月平均百分之十三点五到十四。根据这些情况，第一高炉全体职工提出了竞赛指标：一、提前十二小时完成四月份生产计划，高炉利用系数达到零点八二；二、保证产品质量，消灭生铁废品；三、降低焦比，由点九一○降低到点九○○（每吨生铁降低焦炭十公斤），保证降低成本；四、保证安全，消灭人身和设备事故。
    为了保证实现上述四个指标，他们提出了四个具体办法：一、推行苏联高炉炉顶调剂法和矿石分级入炉等先进经验；二、认真贯彻生产区域一长制；三、加强设备维护，缩短小检修时间，保证检修质量；四、做好出铁口维护工作，提高出铁口深度合格率和全风堵口率。
    第一高炉全体职工在四月三日提出这个竞赛口号后，得到全厂和车间党、政、工、团的支持和帮助，特别是工程技术人员积极帮助他们具体研究和制订竞赛条件。第二天，第一高炉的党支部召开了党、团员和生产骨干分子的会议，进一步深入讨论，大家信心很高，一致表示：“在祖国五年建设的第二年，我们愿意和全国各兄弟厂矿的职工一起，多出一把劲，多炼一吨铁，支援一百四十一项工程。”第一高炉的各个生产小组：全厂模范单位——第一高炉值班室生产小组、重要的生产单位——炉口小组、今年以来进步很大的上料生产小组、华北工业模范小组——李友芝小组、车间先进小组——看水小组、今年以来六战六捷的修理工场、炉前和倒渣等生产小组都订出了保证条件。他们不仅提出要保证执行苏联专家建议，贯彻先进操作法，执行责任制，并且提出了具体生动的口号。如上料生产小组工人提出：保证做到三快（吊车房拉料快、地沟装卸快、皮带机供炭快）、五准（分量准、料线准、仓号准、次序准、料批准）、一安全（人身、机器安全）。从四月三日那一天起，各小组的工人都在为超额完成这个计划而紧张地工作着。
