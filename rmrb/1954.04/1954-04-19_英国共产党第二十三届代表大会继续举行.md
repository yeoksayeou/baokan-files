Xinhua News Agency, London: The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain continued its sessions on the afternoon of the 16th and the morning of the 17th, discussing the political report by Pollitt.

	At the afternoon session on the 16th, representatives from Party organizations in industrial enterprises in Scotland, London, and Lancashire reported on the struggles of Communists in their respective enterprises leading the working people to strive for peace and improve their living standards. Cohen, a member of the Lancashire and Cheshire District Party Committee, introduced the struggle of women for peace and better living conditions.
	The Congress continued to receive congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties around the world. At the end of the afternoon session on the 16th, the Congress announced the congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties in Germany, Japan, Sweden, and other countries.
	At the morning session on the 17th, representatives pointed out in their speeches that the consciousness of the British working class is constantly improving; their struggle to defend their rights is constantly strengthening. Representatives emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the united action of the working people for peace and for the interests of the British nation.
	James Milne, a member of the Supreme Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, introduced the situation of Scottish workers strengthening united action at the Congress. He said that the recently held Scottish Trades Union Congress was against the rearmament of West Germany, advocated the development of trade between East and West, and opposed the implementation of a terroristic colonial policy in British Guiana. He said that this example shows how broad the possibilities are for the Communist Party to unite the working people.
	Peter Kerrigan, a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, pointed out the party's task of fighting for the democratization of trade unions in his speech. He emphasized the need to enhance the role of grassroots trade union organizations and called on representatives to vigorously improve the work of party members in the trade union movement.
	The Congress attached great importance to the issue of striving for peace and ending the American military occupation of Britain. Representatives spoke in their speeches about the growing anti-American sentiment among British workers. They pointed out that the working people of Britain are not only suffering from the arbitrary actions of American warmongers, but also from the direct and cruel exploitation of American monopoly capital, because a considerable part of British enterprises are subordinate to American capital.
	The representatives listened with great attention to the speech of George Matthews, Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In his speech, he talked about the task of fighting for peace and for the national independence of Britain.

    英国共产党第二十三届代表大会继续举行
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党第二十三届代表大会于十六日下午及十七日上午继续举行会议，讨论波立特的政治报告。
    在十六日下午的会议上，苏格兰、伦敦与兰开夏工业企业中党组织的代表们报告了各该企业中共产党员领导劳动人民争取和平与提高生活水平的斗争情况。兰开夏和柴郡区党委会委员柯恩介绍了妇女为争取和平与改善生活条件而进行的斗争。
    大会继续收到各国兄弟党的贺电。在十六日的下午会议结束时，大会宣读了德国、日本、瑞典及其他一些国家兄弟党的贺电。
    在十七日上午的会议上，代表们在发言中都指出，英国工人阶级的觉悟正在不断提高；他们为保卫自身的权利而进行的斗争正不断加强。代表们着重指出：必须加强劳动人民为和平、为英国民族利益而斗争的一致行动。
    苏格兰职工大会最高委员会委员杰姆斯·米尔恩在大会上介绍了苏格兰工人加强一致行动的情况。他说，不久以前举行的苏格兰职工大会是反对武装西德、主张发展东西方贸易和反对对英属圭亚那实行恐怖的殖民政策的。他说，通过这个例子就可以看出共产党具有怎样广泛的可能性来团结劳动人民。
    英国共产党执行委员会委员彼得·柯里根在他的发言中指出了党为工会民主化而斗争的任务。他着重指出必须提高基层工会组织的作用，并号召代表们大力改善党员在工会运动中的工作。
    大会非常重视如何争取和平及终止美国对英国的军事占领问题。代表们在发言中都谈到英国工人中间反美情绪的日益增长。他们指出，英国的劳动人民不仅因美国黩武主义者的专横行动而受害，而且还受到美国垄断资本的直接的残酷剥削，因为有相当一部分的英国企业是从属于美国资本的。
    代表们极为注意地听取了英国共产党副总书记乔治·马修斯的发言。他在发言中谈到了为和平及为英国的民族独立而斗争的任务。
