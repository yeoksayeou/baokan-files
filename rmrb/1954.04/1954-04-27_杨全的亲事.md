    Yang Quan's Marriage
    By our reporter Liu Heng

    I
    On March 24th, just as dawn was breaking, Yang Quan, a member of the New People's Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, was already cooking!
    Cooking for himself was Yang Quan's long-standing habit. However, he had never cooked with such enthusiasm as he did today. In the past, he had to be both wife and husband; after finishing work in the fields, he had barely caught his breath before he had to start the fire. After busying himself in the smoke and flames for a long time, he would eat a couple of mouthfuls of food, then rush to wash the dishes and pots, and hurry back to the fields. Sometimes, in a fit of impatience or anger, he would simply skip a meal. Or, he would simply go to a restaurant to eat, ordering both wine and meat. He said, "I'm fifty years old, and I have neither son nor daughter. If I don't eat it, who am I saving it for?" He thought that after joining the agricultural production cooperative last winter, he would have someone to rely on, and he ate and drank even more extravagantly. Later, after much persuasion from everyone, he improved a little. However, it didn't last long before he secretly went to the restaurant for a couple of drinks again at night. As a result, he not only used up almost all the grain allocated to him by the agricultural production cooperative, but also incurred a debt.
    But today—today cooking was different. Although he was still alone, it was as if there was someone by his side, because today, Yang Quan was going to the district to get a marriage certificate! After eating, he changed into the clothes he wore when visiting guests and waited outside the courtyard.
    Outside the courtyard was a seemingly endless expanse of good crops. In the sunlight, the golden light of the rapeseed flowers dazzled the eyes. Bees were buzzing and singing above, which sounded quite pleasant. Yang Quan walked back and forth on the ridge, stopping from time to time, and standing on tiptoe to look ahead. Following his gaze—ah, he wasn't looking at the bees, or the flowers, he was looking at the distant courtyard that was almost hidden by the crops.
    That courtyard was in the Third Village, only a mile or two away. The widow Wu, whose husband had died the year before, lived in the courtyard. Widow Wu's eldest daughter was married, her second son was in elementary school in town, and her youngest daughter was only four years old. It was very difficult for a woman to raise two children and manage the fields for four people! Fortunately, she had joined a mutual aid team, which meant that she hadn't left a single piece of land uncultivated. Fortunately, Lao Wu was also very careful in her daily life, counting every grain of rice she ate, so that the family of three had enough to eat and wear, and even saved tens of thousands of yuan in the People's Bank every year.
    However, a mutual aid team was no match for an agricultural production cooperative! Last winter, when the New People's Village Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded, Lao Wu asked the cooperative's director, Luo Shifa, to let her join:
    "Even though we're in two villages, our fields are next to each other. I'm relying on your word to come over!"
    "Each village only takes care of its own affairs. Besides, you'll be turning into a cooperative next year anyway!"
    "But that's next year! You don't know how difficult it is for a widow!"
    "If you're having a hard time, it won't be hard after you marry!"
    Lao Wu's face turned red. She opened her mouth several times, wanting to defend herself, but she couldn't say a word.

    II
    The two of them set off for the district people's government when the sun was almost overhead.
    Along the way, Yang Quan was full of joy, only thinking about moving forward. Lao Wu's mind was not so "simple"—women's thoughts were indeed more complicated!
    Lao Wu was forty-eight this year, and it was the first time she had gone out with a man who was neither her husband nor a relative. She let Yang Quan walk in front, and she walked behind him. There was an indescribable feeling in her heart: "Chairman Mao's policy is so good. Chairman Mao advocates free marriage, advocates widows remarrying, and doesn't allow people to talk or laugh!" She glanced at Yang Quan, and thought, "But we've only met a few times, and only talked a few times. How do I know if we'll get along?" The shadows of her two children flashed before her eyes, and she was a little surprised at first, but she quickly calmed down: "Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Lao Yang has neither parents nor three brothers and four cousins at home, just him alone. I heard that he loves children very much, and all the children in his village are wrapped around his finger. Besides, Lao Yang is also a cooperative member, and his village has an advanced organization and Luo Shifa."
    By the time the two of them arrived at the district people's government, the sun had already begun to set.
    The cadres of the district people's government, upon hearing that they wanted to get a marriage certificate, asked them to produce a letter of introduction from the township people's government. Yang Quan said, "We didn't bring a letter of introduction. Didn't they say it wasn't necessary?" The district cadre said, "Who said it wasn't necessary? This is the rule!" Yang Quan wanted to say a few more words, but Lao Wu stopped him: "Forget it, let's come back another day. Anyway, we won't get married until after the rapeseed is harvested, there's still a month or so."
    The two of them walked out of the district people's government and realized that they were both hungry and thirsty. So they walked another three miles to a restaurant in Xinfan County.
    As soon as he entered the restaurant, Yang Quan thought, "This is a rich widow, I can't let her look down on me!" He felt the thirty thousand yuan he had borrowed in his pocket and shouted loudly, "Hey, someone, stir-fry two dishes!"
    "No, no!" Lao Wu hurriedly stopped him in a low voice, "Eat noodles, no dishes!"
    Yang Quan ignored her and shouted in a loud voice, "Bring a plate of twice-cooked pork and a plate of stir-fried kidney!"
    "No, no! Stir-fry two vegetarian dishes!"
    "Hey, let's have some meat, and a little wine?"
    "Don't drink, don't drink, be frugal, don't drink wine!" Lao Wu waved her hands several times, as if chasing away an annoying fly.
    The dishes were brought, steaming hot.
    "Noodles!" Lao Wu shouted at the waiter.
    "Not ready yet, soon!" the waiter replied.
    "Then bring four ounces of wine!" Yang Quan quickly interjected, making it impossible for Lao Wu to stop him.
    The wine was brought, but Lao Wu refused to drink it. Yang Quan asked her to eat the dishes, but she wanted to save the dishes to eat with the noodles. Yang Quan then ate and drank by himself, mouthful after mouthful, cup after cup. Yang Quan only cared about enjoying himself, not realizing that Lao Wu's heart was breaking beside him: "This meal will cost at least ten thousand yuan! Ten thousand yuan can buy ten or so jin of rice, and three jin of meat, enough for us three to eat for many days!" She looked at Yang Quan, feeling a little angry: "Look at his posture, he's used to eating well, he doesn't look like someone who knows how to live! People used to say he had a drinking problem, but they said he'd slowly quit after joining the cooperative. It doesn't seem to be true!" She couldn't help but think about herself: "As the saying goes: 'Not afraid of thick eating, only afraid of thin drinking.' Will we have a good life together in the future?" She seemed to see her one million yuan savings in the bank being taken away by Lao Yang, and she seemed to see her two children getting thinner and thinner, with holes all over their clothes…
    After the two of them finished eating, they walked home, and it was already dark. That night, Lao Wu tossed and turned in bed, her heart in turmoil. The next afternoon, what kind of news came! It turned out that Yang Quan, seeing that the marriage was about to be finalized, couldn't restrain his joy and went to town to get drunk during the day!

    III
    On the morning of March 28th, everyone else had finished eating and gone to the fields, but Yang Quan had only just gotten out of bed to light the stove and cook. It turned out that yesterday he had heard Lao Wu tell him personally: "Don't go to the district again, find another family of high standing!" Later, he heard from others the reason why this woman had changed her mind, which made him feel nauseous and unable to sleep all night.
    Just after he finished eating, the doorway darkened, and Deputy Director Shi Liangcheng came in. Shi Liangcheng's face was full of smiles, and Yang Quan's heart shook, as if he had been hit: "He certainly knows, not only him, everyone in the village knows, and even people in the district and county know!"
    Sure enough, Shi Liangcheng knew everything. He carried a bench, sat down, and slowly said:
    "I say, Lao Yang, this is a very heavy lesson! In the past, we advised you to be thrifty and frugal, but you treated it like water off a duck's back. You thought that after joining the cooperative, with everyone's support, who would starve? Now, look, drinking has made you lose your wife! If people don't want to be with you, what can you do? Now we're talking about free will, is this still the old society? Now are women still using the old standards? Now people choose a partner not based on eating and drinking, not based on ostentation, but based on thrift!"
    Shi Liangcheng saw that Yang Quan kept his head down and didn't say a word, so he stopped talking. After a pause, he laughed loudly, and then said:
    "I say, Lao Yang, there's still hope! Lao Wu isn't a three-year-old child, she's had feelings for you for a long time, and she wouldn't turn against you completely for this little thing. I just talked with Luo Shifa for a while, and Lao Luo is preparing to help you reconcile. However, you should also change your bad habits. If you don't change, do you still expect a widow and orphans to support you in your old age and fill your debt pit? Not to mention that Lao Wu won't agree, even if she does, our cooperative won't allow it! Lao Wu did tell Lao Luo that after joining the cooperative, she would hand over her bankbook to the cooperative for safekeeping, to prevent the family from wasting it. I think the cooperative doesn't need to manage this account for her, but the cooperative should help you formulate a family pact in the future."
    Yang Quan raised his head, and the corners of his mouth twitched, wanting to smile, but he couldn't. Sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness were mixed together in his heart, and he didn't know what to say for a moment.

    杨全的亲事
    本报记者　刘衡
    一
    三月二十四日，天刚闪明，四川省新繁县新民村农业生产合作社的社员杨全就在做饭啦。
    自己做饭自己吃，本是杨全多年来的老规矩。可是，哪一天做饭也没今天这样做得起劲。以前呀，又当婆娘又当汉，放下地里活，还没喘口气，又要烧火啦。烟薰火燎地闹半天，吃上两口饭，又得忙着洗碗刷锅，赶紧下田下地啦。有时一着急，一生气，索性就饿上一顿。或者，索性就上饭馆吃开了，吃的又是酒，又是肉。他说：“我五十啦，又没儿，又没女，不吃留给谁呀？”前年冬天入了农业生产合作社，他以为有了靠头，吃喝得更凶了。以后因为挡不住大家左劝右劝，才稍微好一点。可是，好不了几天，他黑夜又偷偷地上饭馆喝两盅。就这样，他不光把农业生产合作社分给他的粮食用了个差不多，还惹下一笔债。
    今天——今天做饭就不同啦，今天做饭虽说也是一个人，就像身边还有一个人一样，因为今天，杨全要到区上扯（即领取的意思）结婚证哪！吃罢饭，他换上件出门做客穿的衣服，就在院子外边等着了。
    院子外边，是一眼望不到边的好庄稼。太阳地里，菜花的金光刺得人的眼睛直发花。蜜蜂在上边嗡嗡乱唱，怪好听的。杨全在田坎上走过来，转过去，不时停一停，踮起脚尖朝前看。顺着他的眼光看过去——呀，他看的不是蜜蜂，不是花，他在看远远的那座几乎被庄稼遮得看不见了的院子。
    那院子是第三村的，离这儿才一二里路。院子里头住着前年死了男人的吴寡妇。吴寡妇的大女子出了嫁，二儿在街上念小学，小女子才满四岁。一个女人，拉扯着两个娃娃，经管着四个人的田，好作难哟！得亏是参加了互助组，才算把田地一分也没有荒废。得亏老吴过日子又挺精细，一颗一颗地数着粮食吃，闹得一家三口倒也有吃有穿，每年还到人民银行存几十万元。
    可是，互助组到底比不上农业生产合作社呀！去年冬天，新民村农业生产合作社扩大的时候，老吴就向社长罗士发请求入社了：
    “说是两个村子却田挨田呀，靠你一句话，我就过来啦！”
    “一村只管一村事呀。再说，明年你们也要转成合作社呀！”
    “那要等到明年哟，你不晓得寡妇人家好为难！”
    “你为难，嫁过来就不为难啦！”
    老吴的脸红了。嘴巴张了几张，想要申辩几句，可是，一个字也说不出来。
    二
    两人动身往区人民政府去，太阳快当顶了。
    一路上，杨全满心欢喜，只顾往前走。老吴心里就不那样“简单”啦——女人的心思就是多呀！
    老吴今年四十八啦，跟一个说是丈夫不是丈夫、说是亲戚不是亲戚的男人一块儿出门，还是头一次。她让杨全走在前面，自己躲在他后面走。——心里可有一股说不出来的滋味：“毛主席的政策就是好哇，毛主席兴自由结婚，兴寡妇改嫁，还不许人说，不许人笑！”她看了杨全一眼，又想：“可是，我们只见过几次面，只谈过几次话，晓得合不合得拢啊？”两个娃娃的影子在她面前闪了一下，她先是有点吃惊，但马上镇定住了：“不怕，不怕，老杨家里又没公，又没婆，又没三兄四弟，就他一个孤人。听说他挺爱娃娃，他村的娃娃一个个被他哄得团团转。再说，老杨还是个社员，他村有先进组织，有罗士发。”
    等两人赶到区人民政府，太阳已经偏西了。
    区人民政府的干部听说他们要扯结婚证，就叫他们拿出乡人民政府的介绍信来。杨全说：“我们没带介绍信，不是说不要吗？”区干部说：“哪个说的不要哟？这是规矩！”杨全想再说几句，一下被老吴挡住了：“算了，改天再来吧。反正打了菜籽才结婚，还有一个来月呢。”
    两人走出区人民政府，才发现大家都是又饿又渴了，就又走三里路，到新繁县城上饭馆。
    一进饭馆，杨全心里想：“这是个有钱的寡妇呀，可不要让她小看了！”他摸了摸口袋里借来的三万元，就大声吆喝着：“喂，来人，炒两个菜！”
    “不，不！”老吴急忙用小声阻挡：“吃面，不要菜！”
    杨全没有理会，直着嗓子喊：“来一盘回锅肉，一盘炒腰花！”
    “不，不！炒两个素菜！”
    “哎，吃荤的，再来点酒？”
    “不喝不喝，节约，不喝酒！”老吴把手接连摆了几摆，像在赶走一头讨厌的苍蝇。
    菜端来啦，热腾腾地，直冒气儿。
    “面！”老吴冲着跑堂的喊。
    “还没好，快啦！”跑堂的回答。
    “那就来四两酒！”杨全赶紧插一嘴，弄得老吴想拦也拦不住。
    酒端来啦，老吴不肯喝。杨全让她吃菜，她要留着菜吃面。杨全就一个人吃开喝开了，吃了一口又一口，喝了一盅又一盅。杨全只顾自己吃喝得痛快，没想到老吴在旁边把心都要痛破了：“这一吃，少不了要一万元！一万元，能买十来斤米，割肉也有三斤，够我们娘儿三个吃好多天哪！”她看了看杨全，有些生气了：“你看他那个架势，倒是吃惯嘴哪，哪像个过日子的人哪？以前人家说他有酒瘾，还说是进了合作社，慢慢就戒了。看来不是真的！”她不由得又想到自己身上了：“常言说：‘不怕稠吃，单怕稀喝’。以后两人会有好日子过呀？”她好像看见她银行里的一百多万元存款被老杨取光了，好像看见两个娃娃也瘦了，衣服上面破的尽是窟窿……
    两人吃罢，走回家，天都黑了。夜里，老吴在床上翻来覆去，心里头七上八下地翻跟头。第二天下午，传来了什么样的消息呀！原来是：杨全眼看婚事快成了，忍不住心头的高兴，白天跑到街上喝醉啦！
    三
    三月二十八日上午，人家都吃罢饭上地了，杨全才爬起床来烧锅做饭。原来昨天他听见老吴亲口告诉他：“不用再到区上啦，你另找个高门大户吧！”后来他又从旁人嘴里听到这个婆娘变心的原因，呕得他一夜都没睡好觉。
    刚吃罢饭，门口一黑，进来了副社长史良成。史良成满脸都在笑，杨全的心一震，像是挨了一下打：“他当然是知道哪，不光是他，全村人都知道哪，连区上、县上都有人知道哪！”
    果然，史良成把什么都知道清楚了。他端了一个板凳，坐下来，就慢声慢语地说开了：
    “我说，老杨，这是个多重的教训！往日我们劝你要节约，要俭省，你只当耳边风。你以为入了社，有众人扶持，还会把哪个饿倒了？如今，你看吧，喝酒把个婆娘都喝掉了！人家不跟你，你有什么办法？如今讲的是自愿嘛，还是那个旧社会呀？如今妇女还是那个旧眼光呀？如今人家挑对象就不讲究吃喝，不讲究排场，要挑勤俭人！”
    史良成看杨全一直低头不吭气，就把话儿停住了。停了一停，他大声笑了出来，接着又说：
    “我说，老杨，事情还有望呀！人家老吴又不是个三岁娃儿，人家对你早就有心有意，不至于为这点小事就翻脸到底。刚才我跟罗士发谈了一阵，老罗准备帮你去说和说和。只是，你的毛病也该改啦。你不改，你还指望人家孤儿寡母养你的老，填你的债窟窿呀？不说老吴不会肯，就是肯，我们合作社也不让呀！老吴倒是跟老罗说过，她入了社，要把银行折子交给合作社保存，免得一家人浪费掉了。我看，合作社倒不必替她管这一笔账，合作社以后倒是应该帮你们订个家庭公约。”
    杨全把头抬起来了，嘴角牵动了一下，想笑，又没笑得出来。他心里头酸甜苦辣混成一疙瘩，一时不晓得该说点什么才好。
