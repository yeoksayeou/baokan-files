　　Tangshan Steel Plant Steelmaking Workshop Sets Production Increase and Savings Plan
    Actively Participating in Labor Emulation to Welcome "May Day"
    [Reported by this newspaper] The workers of the Tangshan Steel Plant Steelmaking Workshop enthusiastically responded to the labor emulation initiated by the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Steelmaking Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day. The entire workshop staff, in conjunction with the actual situation of the workshop, enthusiastically discussed the conditions for launching the emulation, and have now formulated a production increase and savings plan.
    In the first quarter, while the main production equipment was undergoing major repairs, the Tangshan Steel Plant Steelmaking Workshop completed the state plan five days and eight hours ahead of schedule, with a total production volume 1.58% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Although this production situation has not changed in April, the enthusiasm of the workers is high, and they have decided to guarantee the following five points in the emulation:
    1. Guarantee the completion of the April production plan forty-six hours ahead of schedule, with an average daily production volume exceeding the previous highest record by 2.45% or more.
    2. Guarantee an increase in production and savings of 3.3 billion yuan in April.
    3. Improve quality, so that the qualified rate is more than 0.25% higher than the quota, and the first-class product rate is more than 0.5% higher than the quota.
    4. Reduce pig iron consumption, guaranteeing a reduction of six kilograms compared to the quota.
    5. Ensure safe production and eliminate major personal and equipment accidents.
    In order to ensure the realization of the emulation conditions, all employees also decided to take five specific measures:
    1. Conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet expert Comrade Sherakunoff, improve the design and operation method of the cupola furnace, increase the temperature of molten iron, and shorten the converter smelting time, to ensure increased output and improved quality.
    2. Consolidate and improve Cai Liancheng's "deep blowing first, then surface blowing" operation method, Li Wanshan's group post responsibility system, and other advanced working methods.
    3. Do a good job in the production area responsibility system and hold good production meetings.
    4. Strengthen safety inspections and equipment maintenance work.
    5. Maintain good contact with brother workshops to ensure the early completion of major repairs, ventilation, and other projects.
