The Dalian-Lushun Electric Power Bureau Laboratory successfully developed a machine for creating artificial lightning. The Dalian-Lushun area has many high-voltage lightning arresters, some of which have deteriorated over time, causing frequent lightning damage and power outages. To solve this key problem, the laboratory successfully developed a machine for creating artificial lightning on March 8th. An energization test was conducted on the afternoon of the 9th, and the test results proved that the machine had good performance.

On March 12th, this machine was used to test the high-voltage lightning arresters of various systems in the Dalian-Lushun area. In just over twenty days, all the lightning arresters in the electric power system have been tested. Workers will begin testing high-voltage lightning arresters for various factories and mines. This machine plays a significant role in ensuring that the electric power system and various factories and mines are permanently protected from lightning strikes.

    旅大电业局试验所试制人造雷的机器成功
    旅大电业局试验所试制人造雷的机器成功。旅大地区设有很多高压避雷器，有些避雷器年久变质，因而经常发生雷害，造成停电事故。试验所为了解决这一关键问题，于三月八日试制人造雷的机器成功。九日下午举行送电试验，试验结果，证明这台机器效能良好。
    三月十二日已开始用这台机器来试验旅大地区各系统的高压避雷器。仅在二十几天的时间内，电业系统全部的避雷器已试验完毕。工人们将开始给各厂矿试验高压避雷器。这台机器对保证电业系统和各厂矿永远不受雷电的危害起着很大的作用。
