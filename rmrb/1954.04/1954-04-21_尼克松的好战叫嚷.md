    Nixon's Warmongering Rhetoric
    Wu Quan
    U.S. Vice President Nixon delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 16, openly stating that the United States would send troops to directly participate in the Indochina War. At the same time, he declared that the United States would "take a firm attitude" at the Geneva Conference, so that the conference would "have no other result than a stalemate."
    From all reactions, including the statement issued by the U.S. State Department on this matter, it can be seen that Nixon's arrogant remarks represent a series of adventurous policies recently announced by the U.S. ruling group. The U.S. State Department's statement on April 17 stated that Nixon's speech "expressed complete agreement and support for the policies on Indochina previously announced by the President and the Secretary of State." This policy is to force Britain, France, and other countries to participate in the so-called "united action," to carry out new adventures to expand the Indochina War, and to turn the Indochina War into a repeat of the Korean War.
    In fact, Nixon's warmongering clamor is nothing new. The United States is stepping into the Indochina War step by step. Dulles' efforts to peddle "united action" in Western Europe were unsuccessful, and he was criticized and resisted by the public opinion in Britain and France, especially in France; his attempt to force Britain and France to agree to the aggressive plan to establish a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific has also aroused concern from all parties. The closer the Geneva Conference gets, the more panicked and anxious the U.S. war group becomes, fearing that the Indochina War will stop. Therefore, Nixon followed Dulles and more rudely intensified the pressure on Britain and France, determined to undermine the Geneva Conference. At the same time, the U.S. ruling group began to use the propaganda machine to intensify its public clamor for "taking a tough stance at the Geneva Conference and not yielding to the demands of the Communists: achieving a ceasefire," while clamoring for expanding the Indochina War. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford suggested sending aircraft carriers and long-range bombers from the Philippines to directly participate in the Indochina War. According to a United Press International dispatch from Hong Kong on the 18th, a U.S. aircraft carrier has sailed into the Indochina Sea, and a "senior U.S. military official" declared that once the United States decides to "take direct military action in Indochina," the "Navy can immediately take such action." It can be seen that the U.S.'s adventurous conspiracy has reached an extremely arrogant level.
    Although U.S. reactionary congressmen, seeing the people's unease, dare not openly support the plan to directly participate in the Indochina War, they cannot conceal their warmongering sentiments. For example, Republican Senator Knowland openly told the press that he believed "President Eisenhower will ask Congress to approve sending U.S. troops to Indochina." He also said, "The possibility of sending naval and air forces has been considered," and "the possibility of sending ground troops to Indochina" "is not unimaginable."
    To achieve the goal of expanding the Indochina War, the U.S. ruling group must first drag France to its death on the Indochina battlefield. Nixon's adventurous clamor is clearly a threat to France, openly describing the achievement of a ceasefire in Indochina, which is in line with the interests of the entire French nation and the security interests of all countries, as "a defeat for the free world," and rudely threatening France that if the French government seeks a ceasefire in Indochina at the Geneva Conference due to domestic political pressure, the United States will "take an attitude that it will have to take largely alone." In the eyes of the U.S. ruling group, France is clearly not allowed to consider its own national interests. They want to force France to send people to fight for the United States and tie France's hands, not allowing it to have any "freedom" to negotiate at the Geneva Conference. That is to say, the United States wants to use this method of putting France to death to realize its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference, expand the Indochina War, and threaten peace and security in Southeast Asia.
    Not only that, the U.S. ruling group has never wanted to conceal the United States' ambition to seize France's position in Indochina when threatening France. One of the policies listed by Nixon that the United States should adopt is: "Urge France to guarantee independence to Vietnam (puppet) at some point in the future." This means that the United States wants to seize Indochina and kick France out of this place. U.S. Senator Smathers openly said, "This will provide us with a purpose to intervene in the name of defending freedom." Needless to say, this purpose is for the United States to "take over" the Indochina War and seize Indochina from France.
    The adventurous policies advocated by Nixon seriously threaten peace and security in the Far East and Southeast Asia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a statement issued on April 17, criticized the United States for coercing other countries to establish military blocs in Southeast Asia, and such adventurous activities "have made India and Southeast Asia increasingly uneasy."
    There is no doubt that peace-loving people in all countries will be sufficiently vigilant against the war-mongering clamor and the conspiracy to expand the war by the U.S. ruling group. If arsonists are bent on disregarding the wishes and struggles of the broad masses of people for peace, the ones who will ultimately suffer are them.

    尼克松的好战叫嚷
    吴全
    美国副总统尼克松四月十六日在美国报纸编辑协会年会上发表演说，公然表示美国将要派遣军队直接参加印度支那战争；同时他又声言美国将在日内瓦会议上“采取坚决的态度”，使会议“除了僵局之外不会有其他结果”。
    从各方的反应中，包括美国国务院为此发表的声明在内，都可以看出，尼克松的狂妄言论，是代表着美国统治集团最近宣布的一连串冒险政策的。美国国务院四月十七日发表的声明就说：尼克松的演说“表示完全同意和支持总统和国务卿早先所宣布的对印度支那的政策”，这个政策就是强迫英法等国参加所谓“联合行动”，进行扩大印度支那战争的新的冒险，把印度支那战争变为朝鲜战争的翻版。
    事实上，尼克松的好战叫嚣，早已不是什么新花样。美国正在一步一步地钻到印度支那战争中去。杜勒斯到西欧去兜揽“联合行动”没有得逞，受到了英法两国特别是法国公众舆论的指责和反抗；他逼迫英法同意在东南亚和西太平洋建立军事联盟的侵略计划，也引起各方的不安。日内瓦会议越快到了，美国好战集团就越是惊慌着急，惟恐印度支那战争会停下来。因此，尼克松就跟着杜勒斯出来，更加粗暴地加紧对英法施行压力，一心想搞垮日内瓦会议。同时，美国统治集团并开始通过宣传机器，一面加紧公开叫嚣“在日内瓦会议上采取强硬态度，不要屈从共产党的要求：实现停火。”一面叫嚷扩大印度支那战争。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福建议从菲律宾派遣航空母舰和远程轰炸机直接参加印度支那战争。据合众社香港十八日电，美国航空母舰已驶入印度支那海面，一个“美国高级军界人士”扬言，一旦美国决定“在印度支那采取直接军事行动”后“海军马上就可采取这种行动”。由此可见，美国的冒险阴谋已到了多末嚣张的程度了。
    美国反动议员们虽然由于看到人民的不安，不敢公然支持直接参加印度支那战争的计划，但也并不能掩饰他们的好战情绪。例如共和党参议员诺兰就公开对报界说：他相信“艾森豪威尔总统将请求国会批准派美国军队到印度支那去。”他又说，“派遣海空军的可能性已经考虑过了”，“派遣地面部队到印度支那去的可能性”“并不是不可想像的”。
    美国统治集团要实现扩大印度支那战争的目的，首先就要把法国拖死在印度支那战场上。尼克松的冒险叫嚣明明是对法国施行威胁，公然把实现符合于法国全民族利益和各国安全利益的印度支那停战，说成“是自由世界‘一种败绩’”，并粗暴地威胁法国说，如果法国政府由于国内的政治压力而在日内瓦会议上谋求印度支那停战，美国就“将要采取一种不得不要在很大的程度上单独采取的态度”，在美国统治集团的眼中，显然是不能容许法国有自己的民族利益的考虑的。他们既要迫使法国出人命替美国继续打仗，又要绑住法国的手脚，不许它在日内瓦会议上有任何进行协商的“自由”。这就是说，美国要以这种把法国置于死地的办法，来实现其破坏日内瓦会议扩大印度支那战争并威胁东南亚的和平与安全的阴谋。
    不仅如此。美国统治集团在威胁法国的时候，从来也不想掩饰美国力图在印度支那夺取法国地位的野心。尼克松所列举的美国应采取的政策中就有这样一条：“敦促法国保证在未来的某一时候给予越南（傀儡）独立”这就是说，美国要把印度支那夺到手，把法国踢出这个地方。美国参议员斯马特斯就公开说“这样将为我们以保卫自由的名义进行干涉提供一个目的”。不用说，这个目的就是由美国来“接管”印度支那战争，从法国手里夺取印度支那。
    尼克松所鼓吹的冒险政策，严重地威胁到远东及东南亚地区的和平与安全。印度总理尼赫鲁在四月十七日所发表的声明中，就曾指责美国胁迫其他国家在东南亚建立军事集团的做法，这种冒险活动
  “已使印度和东南亚愈来愈不安了。”
    毫无疑问，各国爱好和平的人们，对于美国统治集团的好战叫嚣及扩大战争的阴谋活动，将有着足够的警惕。如果放火犯存心不顾广大人民要求和平的愿望和斗争，最后倒霉的总是他们。
