Over the course of a month, the delegation representatives and art personnel extended their regards to various organs and troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou, and also visited major and minor islands, such as Dongshan, Xiamen, Pingtan, and the Minjiang Estuary, as well as mountainous areas such as Yong'an and Longyan, to express their regards to the troops bravely guarding the frontline of the motherland's coastal defense and the troops diligently protecting forests and bridges day and night. The delegation representatives also paid respects at the cemeteries of the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves in the battles to liberate Fujian and defend the coast.

After expressing their regards to the troops of the PLA Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army stationed in Guangzhou, the delegation representatives divided into four routes to visit the troops in eastern Guangdong, western Guangdong, Hainan, and the areas near Guangzhou. The delegation representatives visited many heroic model units such as the "Tashan Heroic Regiment," the "Heroic Red First Company," the "Iron Red Second Company," the "Iron Fengyuan Company," and the "Wang Yushan Squad"; they also visited a certain "Amphibious Vanguard Battalion" that made contributions in the battle to liberate Hainan Island. The delegation's art troupes, song and dance troupes, Peking opera troupes, and film projection teams also went deep into the companies, platoons, squads, and positions to perform literary and artistic programs and show movies for the soldiers.

The comfort activities of the Sixth General Sub-Delegation and its subordinate provincial and municipal sub-delegations have basically concluded in all provinces and cities, except for some representatives who are still continuing their visits in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The delegation representatives extensively visited the organs, troops, schools, and hospitals of the PLA North China Military Region stationed in various places; they also reported to the broad masses of commanders and fighters on the general line of the state during the transition period and the great construction achievements of the state over the past four years. The delegation's theater troupes and art troupes performed hundreds of excellent programs for the troops. The First Sub-Delegation and the Third Sub-Delegation of the General Sub-Delegation also organized troops to visit factories in Beijing and Tianjin respectively.

The comfort work of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation has basically concluded. The delegation representatives held many comfort meetings in the troops and gave many reports on the achievements of industrial and agricultural construction. The delegation's art troupe performed more than 120 comfort performances for the troops. The delegation representatives also paid respects at the cemeteries of the People's Liberation Army martyrs in various places. When the comfort activities of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation were basically concluded, the leading organs of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a farewell meeting. Mo Wenhua, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, expressed his gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the Northeast Military Region, and stated that they must continue to study the general line of the state during the transition period, enhance the socialist ideological awareness of the troops, continue to follow the instructions of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen the construction of national defense modernization and enhance the unity within the army, and strengthen the unity between the army and the people.
