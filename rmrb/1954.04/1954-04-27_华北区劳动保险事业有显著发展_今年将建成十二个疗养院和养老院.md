Significant development has been made in the collective labor insurance programs of industrial and mining enterprises in North China. Currently, there are more than 200 workers' sanatoriums and rest homes in the region, with a total of more than 6,000 beds. In 1953, more than 17,000 employees received sanatorium and rest home care. This year, in addition to continuing to run sanatoriums, rest homes, nutritious canteens, and nutritious stations, trade union organizations at all levels in North China will complete twelve sanatoriums and nursing homes with a total of 2,030 beds.

Since 1950, trade union organizations in various provinces and cities in North China, as well as in industrial and mining enterprises, have begun to run various sanatoriums and rest homes, including those that are completely separated from production, half-day, and after-work. For example, 201 industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing that implement labor insurance have established 110 tuberculosis sanatoriums. Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine has established an after-work sanatorium for single digestive organ diseases. Tianjin No. 2 and No. 6 State-owned Cotton Textile Factories have established sanatoriums for stomach diseases and women's diseases, respectively.

Workers receive appropriate rest, various nutritious foods, and medical treatment in sanatoriums and rest homes. Sanatoriums (homes) run by trade union organizations in various provinces and cities in North China generally have nutrition nurses and nutrition rooms. For example, the Datong City Workers' Sanatorium has a special nutrition room with a nutrition nurse responsible for preparing food, and the meals are different every week. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Sanatorium also has specialist doctors and X-ray equipment. Various regular cultural and recreational activities are also carried out in the sanatoriums and rest homes. The Taiyuan Tobacco Factory's Tuberculosis Sanatorium and the Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory's after-work rest home are equipped with recreational and sports equipment such as playing cards and carrom boards, as well as books and picture albums. The health workers at the Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory's rest home also regularly lead the recuperating workers in games and radio exercises. Appropriate rest and recuperation enable employees to quickly recover their health. Of the more than 2,300 workers in Beijing suffering from lung diseases, more than 750 have recovered and returned to work. Since the Taiyuan Tobacco Factory established the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, it has basically eliminated the spread of tuberculosis, and most of the workers who have rested have recovered their health. Workers resting in the after-work rest home of the No. 2 Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Area have all gained weight, some by more than six jin.

The recuperating workers personally experience the care of the Party and the People's Government, and their enthusiasm for labor is high after returning to their production posts. Suo Qingming, the leader of the digging team of the Fengfeng No. 2 Mine, after recuperating, took the initiative to help the main roadway can workers' group improve their operating methods, increasing the number of cans pushed per person per day from 18 to 29. Song Xiuchuan, a bricklayer at the Shalingzi Construction Site of the Zhangjiakou Construction Engineering Bureau, after recuperating, led the entire group to promote the double-handed mud squeezing method, completing the 19-day plan in 14 and a half days. Liu Zhenqi, a worker at the Beijing Zhenhua Printing Factory, had lung disease. After recuperating in the sanatorium for more than three months and recovering, he worked enthusiastically and, through careful research, mixed chemical drugs into 700 pounds of stock waste ink to replace new ink, saving the country 28 million yuan of wealth.

    华北区劳动保险事业有显著发展
    今年将建成十二个疗养院和养老院
    华北区工矿企业的集体劳动保险事业有很大发展。目前，全区工人疗养院和休养所已有二百多个，共有六千多张床位。一九五三年共有一万七千多名职工先后得到了疗养和休养。今年华北各级工会组织除继续举办疗养院、休养所、营养食堂、营养站等外，并将建成共有二千零三十个床位的十二个疗养院和养老院。
    自一九五○年起，华北各省、市和工矿企业的工会组织就开始举办了各种疗养院和休养所，包括完全脱离生产的、半天的和业余的。如北京市二百零一个实行劳动保险的工矿企业，即举办了一百一十个肺病疗养所。开滦赵各庄煤矿举办了消化器官单一病种业余疗养所。国营天津第二、六棉纺织厂分别建立了胃病、妇女病疗养所。
    工人们在疗养院、休养所中得到了适当的休养和各种营养丰富的食品以及医药治疗。华北区各省、市工会组织举办的疗养院（所）一般均有营养护士和营养室。如大同市工人疗养院专门设了营养室，有专门负责调配食品的营养护士，每个星期内，饭菜不重样。石景山钢铁厂疗养所还有专科大夫和爱克斯光设备。各疗养院、休养所还开展了各种经常性的文化娱乐活动。太原烟草厂肺病疗养室和国营天津第一棉纺织厂业余休养所中，都备有扑克牌、克朗棋等文娱体育用品和图书、画报等。国营天津第一棉纺织厂休养所保健员还经常带领休养员做游戏和广播体操。适当的休养和疗养，使职工健康很快得到恢复。北京市二千三百多个患肺病的工人，已有七百五十多人先后痊愈恢复了工作。太原烟草厂举办肺病疗养室以来，已基本上消灭了肺病的蔓延，休养的工人大部已恢复健康。在峰峰矿区第二矿业余休养所休养的工人，每人体重都有增加，有的增加到六斤多。
    休养的工人们亲身体验到党和人民政府的关怀，回到生产岗位后劳动热情高涨。峰峰第二矿掘工组长索清明经过休养，主动帮助大巷罐工组改进操作方法，由每人每日推十八罐提高到二十九罐。张家口建筑工程局沙岭子工地砌砖工人宋秀全休养以后，带动全组推广了双手挤浆法，十四天半完成了十九天计划。北京市振华印刷厂工人刘振奇有肺病，在疗养所休养三个多月，痊愈后，他热情地工作，经细心钻研，在七百磅库存的废油墨里掺上化学药品，代替了新油墨，给国家节省了二千八百万元财富。
