    Farmers in Wheat-Producing Areas of Shanxi Province Actively Expand Spring Wheat Planting Area
    Farmers in Shanxi are actively expanding the spring wheat planting area. The province plans to sow 2.32 million mu of spring wheat this year, an increase of 570,000 mu over last year. Agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams have played a leading role in expanding the spring wheat planting area. The seven agricultural producers' cooperatives in Tulingxi and Xigou, Xin County, have expanded spring wheat by more than 150 mu this year. Influenced by the leading role of agricultural producers' cooperatives in expanding the planting area, Pianling Township, Huairen County, has expanded spring wheat by 300 mu. Li Fa Mutual Aid Team in An'dingying Village, Second District, Yanggao, planted 20 mu of wheat last year and had a good harvest. This year, they plan to plant 91 mu, accounting for half of the team's cultivated land area.
    In order to ensure timely sowing and increase yield per unit area, farmers throughout the province began accumulating fertilizer and transporting manure and working on plowing and preserving soil moisture as early as last winter. Most of the wheat fields in the Yanbei area have been plowed and harrowed, and fertilizer accumulation has increased by about 15% per mu compared with last year. In the Chuanxia area, autumn manure has been basically transported. The mountainous areas are sending manure now because the climate is slightly colder and the sowing season is later. Various places have made preparations for seed preparation early. Yuchi and Xin County areas have transferred more than 2.1 million jin of spring wheat seeds from the Grain Bureau. Incomplete statistics from Yanbei area show that the amount of wheat seeds exchanged and transferred among the masses alone is more than 7,300 shi. In order to ensure full seedlings, various places have also conducted seed germination tests one after another, and some areas have started sowing in late March.

    山西省产麦区农民积极扩大春麦播种面积
    山西农民纷纷扩大春麦播种面积。全省今年计划播种春麦二百三十二万亩，比去年扩大五十七万亩。在扩大春麦播种面积中，农业生产合作社和互助组都起了带头作用。忻县土岭西、西沟等七个农业生产合作社，今年共扩大春麦一百五十多亩。怀仁偏岭乡在农业生产合作社带头扩大播种面积的影响下，全乡共扩大春麦三百亩。阳高二区安定营村李发互助组去年种二十亩小麦，收成很好，今年要种九十一亩，占全组耕地面积一半。
    全省农民为保证适时播种，提高单位面积产量，早在去冬就开始积肥送粪及耕耙保墒工作。雁北专区麦地大部都耕耙过，积肥约比去年每亩增加百分之十五左右，川下地区秋粪基本送完，山区因气候稍冷，播种节气较迟，正在送粪。籽种准备方面，各地已提早做了准备。榆次、忻县两专区由粮食局调出春麦籽二百一十多万斤。雁北专区不完全统计，仅群众互换、调换的小麦籽种就有七千三百多市石。为了保证全苗，各地并先后进行种籽发芽试验，部分地区在三月下旬已开始下种。
