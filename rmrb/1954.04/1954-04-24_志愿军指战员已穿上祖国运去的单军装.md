Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 23rd. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have now donned single-layer uniforms shipped from the motherland.

This year's summer clothing for the Volunteer Army from the motherland is even better than last year. The soldiers particularly love the beautiful and sturdy leather shoes issued this year. The people of the motherland also thoughtfully included a box of shoe polish in each pair of leather shoes. The soldiers of a certain unit's guard company jumped for joy after receiving their uniforms and leather shoes, saying: The people of the motherland are thinking ahead for us in everything. Before we even took off our cotton-padded clothes, the new uniforms were already shipped here! After receiving their uniforms and leather shoes, many units also talked about the benefits of the motherland's industrialization in connection with the general task of the country during the transition period.

The Volunteer Army commanders and fighters, after putting on their new uniforms and shoes, all looked particularly strong and happy. They said: Our new uniforms contain the feelings of the people of the motherland. We must increase our vigilance a hundredfold and defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    志愿军指战员已穿上祖国运去的单军装
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】中国人民志愿军的指挥员、战斗员已经穿上了祖国运来的单军装。
    今年祖国给志愿军的夏季服装比去年更加好了。战士们非常喜爱今年发的美观而结实的皮鞋。祖国人民还特别关心地在每双皮鞋里装上一盒擦皮鞋油。某部警卫连的战士们领到了军衣和皮鞋后欢乐得跳了起来说：什么事情祖国人民都给我们想在头里，棉衣还没脱下来，新军装就给运来了！许多部队在领到了军衣和皮鞋后，还结合国家在过渡时期的总任务漫谈祖国工业化的好处。
    志愿军指挥员、战斗员们在穿上了新军装和新皮鞋后，个个都显得格外健壮和愉快。他们说：我们穿的新军装包含着祖国人民的心意，我们一定要百倍地提高警惕，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
