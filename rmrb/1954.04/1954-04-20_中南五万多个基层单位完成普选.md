Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 19th: More than 56,000 grassroots units in the Central and Southern region, covering a population of over 140 million, have successfully completed grassroots elections and established a more complete system of people's congresses at the grassroots level.

    During the universal suffrage, the broad masses of people fully exercised democracy and conducted a serious and profound assessment of the elected cadres, making the cadres more aware of their great responsibilities and determined to complete the tasks assigned to them by the people. At present, grassroots cadres in various places are enthusiastically leading farmers in spring plowing and production, and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many township and village cadres in Henan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces are using various meetings to educate farmers on the direction and policies of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, or using exemplary methods to educate farmers with examples, promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places. In Nanhu Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, under the help and education of cadres, 53 out of 56 households in the seventh village participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After Zhang Guohua and Xiao Shikui, cadres of Wangjiaban Village, Xiaojia’ao Township, Luotian County, were elected, they led the farmers of the whole village to repair a large drainage ditch that had not been repaired for more than ten years. The farmers said with satisfaction: Thanks to the election of good cadres, the ditch was opened, and half a harvest became a bumper harvest. Under the leadership of cadres and people's representatives, all the farmers in Lishi Township, Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, actively implemented the resolution to increase production, and accumulated more than 4,300 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer in three days.

    Because the ties between grassroots cadres and the masses of the people in various places have become closer, the unity within the masses of the people has been promoted and strengthened. In the third district of Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, the masses of the people in various townships often had opinions on mountain forests and water conservancy issues in the past. After universal suffrage, the masses of the people in various townships smoothly resolved eleven historical major disputes based on the principle of mutual benefit. During the election in 84 townships in Yongning County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 1,900 large and small disputes among various ethnic groups that had been left over for a long time were satisfactorily resolved. After the Zhuang and Yao ethnic groups in Duyang Township, Pingguo County, eliminated ethnic estrangement, the relationship between the two ethnic groups was very good. Zhuang farmers took the initiative to teach Yao farmers how to cultivate land, and also absorbed Yao farmers to participate in mutual aid groups. After the election in the Qi Bai Nong area of ​​Duan County, Guangxi Province, the ethnic unity was promoted, and the Yao Autonomous Region People's Government (district level) was established. In the past, the Yao and Zhuang ethnic groups in Youqi Township often lacked water sources, which caused some disunity, and no one could use anyone else's pond. During the spring plowing this year, when the Zhuang people's ponds were dry, the Yao farmers took the initiative to invite them to fetch water.

    After the universal suffrage, the grassroots regimes in various places have simplified their organizations, improved their working methods, and gradually improved their working systems, which has significantly improved the work efficiency of the grassroots regimes. In the past, Jiangtou Township, Tonggu County, Jiangxi Province, had 11 various regular and temporary committees, and the grassroots cadres held too many concurrent positions, and were busy all day long, and the division of labor for many specific tasks was not clear. After the universal suffrage, Jiangtou Township merged the original 11 committees into 6 committees, and the cadres clearly divided their work and reduced the number of concurrent positions, so that the task was completed quickly and well, making the township quickly become an advanced township in work. Some townships have carried out a scientific division of labor according to work needs and cadre conditions, and have determined the sessions of the township people's congress and the township government committee, and established duty, archive and other systems. In the past, Dongchongfan Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, always liked to hold all-inclusive meetings, and the division of labor was not clear. The resolutions could not be conveyed for a long time. After the universal suffrage, the responsibilities and scope of division of labor were clarified, and small-scale symposiums and methods of conveying information in mutual aid groups were adopted, and the work was carried out very well.

    中南五万多个基层单位完成普选
    【新华社武汉十九日电】　中南区已有五万六千多个基层单位，共约一亿四千多万人口的地区胜利结束基层选举工作，建立了更加完备的人民代表大会制的基层政权。
    在普选中，广大人民充分发扬了民主，对当选的干部进行了一次认真的、深刻的鉴别，使干部更加认识到自己责任重大，决心完成人民交付自己的各项工作任务。目前，各地基层干部正热情高涨地领导农民进行春耕生产和开展互助合作运动。河南、广东、江西、湖北等省许多乡、村干部，利用各种会议向农民进行走互助合作道路的方向和政策的教育，或以创造典型的方式，用实例教育农民，推动了各地互助合作运动的发展。湖北省麻城县南湖乡七村农民在干部的帮助教育下，全村五十六户有五十三户参加了互助合作组织。罗田县萧家坳乡王家畈村干部张国华、萧士魁当选以后，领导全村农民修了一条十几年没有修成的大水沟。农民满意地说：多亏选了好干部，开了这条沟，半收变成丰收。广东省曲江县黎市乡全体农民在干部和人民代表的带领下，积极贯彻增加生产的决议，在三天内积杂肥四千三百多担。
    由于各地基层干部和人民群众之间的联系更加密切，促进和加强了人民群众内部的团结。江西省东乡县第三区各乡群众相互间过去常因山林、水利问题有意见，经过普选，各乡群众本着互利原则，顺利地解决了十一件历史性的重大纠纷。广西省桂西僮族自治区邕宁县八十四个乡在选举中，圆满地解决了长期遗留下来的各民族间大小纠纷一千九百多件。平果县都阳乡僮族和瑶族消除了民族隔阂后，两族人民的关系很好，僮族农民主动教给瑶族农民耕地方法，还吸收瑶族农民参加互助组。广西省都安县七百?地区经过选举，促进了民族团结，成立了瑶族自治区人民政府（区级），尤齐乡瑶族和僮族间过去常因水源缺乏，有些不团结，谁也不能用谁的水塘。今年春耕时，僮族的水塘干了，瑶族农民便主动请他们来取水。
    经过普选，各地基层政权都简化了组织，改进了工作方法，工作制度也逐渐健全，使基层政权的工作效能有了显著提高。江西省铜鼓县江头乡原来有各种经常性和临时性的委员会十一个，基层干部兼职过多，整天忙碌，许多具体工作分工又不明确，普选后，江头乡把原来的十一个委员会合并成六个委员会，干部明确分工，减少了兼职，这样完成工作任务又快又好，使这个乡很快成为工作先进的乡。有的乡按照工作需要和干部情况，进行了科学分工，并确定了乡人民代表大会和乡政府委员会的会期，建立了值日、档案等制度。湖北省罗田县东冲畈乡，过去总好开一揽子会，分工不明确，决议很久还传达不下去，经过普选后，职责、分工范围都明确了，并采用小型座谈会，以及在互助组里传达的方法，工作进行得很好。
