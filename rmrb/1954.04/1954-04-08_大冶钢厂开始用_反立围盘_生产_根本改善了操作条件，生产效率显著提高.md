    Daye Steel Plant Begins Production with "Reverse Vertical Roller"
    Operation Conditions Fundamentally Improved, Production Efficiency Significantly Increased
   [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The "reverse vertical roller" successfully trial-produced by the workers of the rolling mill workshop of Daye Steel Plant has been officially put into production on April 1st. On the morning of the 1st, the rolling mill workshop held a grand opening ceremony. Responsible cadres from the Party, government organs and trade unions of the Central South District, Hubei Province, and Huangshi City, as well as representatives from brother factories and mines, brother workshops, and advanced producers, attended to offer congratulations. At 10 o'clock, with the ring of an electric bell, the rolling mill spun into action, splashing water. Red-hot steel billets emerged from the heating furnace, one after another, racing along the roller table towards the rolling mill. Now, except for the first stand, where steel feeding and receiving are still done manually, at the second stand's second exit, the steel billet follows the "positive roller" into the inlet of the third stand's "reverse vertical roller," then emerges from the third stand and passes through another "positive roller" into the fourth stand, and then passes through a "reverse roller" into the fifth stand. The finished products from the fifth stand then move along the roller table straight to the cooling bed. The people who were visiting couldn't help but erupt in enthusiastic applause for the achievement of mechanization and automation in the rolling mill workshop of Daye Steel Plant as they saw one steel billet after another automatically and rapidly changing from thick to thin, from short to long, and finally becoming a finished product.
    The application of the "reverse vertical roller" in the rolling mill workshop of Daye Steel Plant has fundamentally improved the high-temperature working conditions, allowing the rolling mill workers to put down their heavy iron tongs and greatly increasing production efficiency. Now, the number of workers required for each shift of the rolling mill can be reduced from twenty-one to eleven or ten, saving 624 to 780 workdays per month; the steel feeding time can also be shortened from seven seconds per billet to half a second per billet, increasing efficiency by thirteen times; and it also solves the problem of rolling small-size steel and rolling small steel bars under twelve meters.
    On the same afternoon, Daye Steel Plant held a celebration rally, awarding material and honorary rewards to the workers who contributed to the creation of the "reverse vertical roller." The rally also read out congratulatory telegrams and letters from organs and organizations in the Central South District, Hubei Province, and Huangshi City, and the rally concluded with the adoption of a salute telegram from all the workers of Daye Steel Plant to Chairman Mao.

    大冶钢厂开始用“反立围盘”生产
    根本改善了操作条件，生产效率显著提高
   【本报讯】大冶钢厂轧钢车间职工试制成功的“反立围盘”已在四月一日正式投入生产。一日上午，轧钢车间举行了开车典礼大会，前往庆贺的有中南区、湖北省、黄石市的党、政机关和工会的负责干部，各兄弟厂矿、兄弟车间的代表和先进生产者。十点钟，电铃一响，轧辊溅着水花旋转起来。通红的钢胚从加热炉跑出来，一根接着一根地沿着辊道奔向轧钢机。现在，除第一挡还用人工喂钢接钢外，在第二挡第二次出口，钢胚就顺着“正围盘”走入第三挡“反立围盘”的进口，接着从第三挡出来通过另一“正围盘”进入第四挡，然后再经过“反围盘”走入第五挡，五挡出口的成品便沿着辊道直奔冷床。参观的人们，看到一根又一根的钢胚自动地迅速地由粗变细，由短变长，最后变成了成品，不禁为大冶钢厂轧钢车间机械化自动化的成就，热烈地鼓起了不息的掌声。
    大冶钢厂轧钢车间运用“反立围盘”生产，根本上改善了高温作业条件，使轧钢工人丢下了笨重的铁钳，大大提高了生产效率。现在，轧钢机每班生产可由二十一人减少到十一人或十人，每月可节省六百二十四个到七百八十个工；喂钢时间，也可由原来七秒钟喂一根，缩短为半秒钟喂一根，效率提高十三倍；同时还解决了轧小尺寸钢材和轧十二公尺以下小钢条的问题。
    当天下午，大冶钢厂举行了庆功大会，对创制“反立围盘”有贡献的职工分别给以物质和荣誉的奖励。大会并宣读了中南区、湖北省和黄石市等地机关、团体的贺电和贺信，大会最后通过了大冶钢厂全体职工向毛主席的致敬电。
