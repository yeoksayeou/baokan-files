Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Workers and Technicians Create Automated Dyeing Vats

    Relying on the collective wisdom of workers and technicians from many printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai, the formerly labor-intensive manually operated dyeing vats in printing and dyeing factories have now been automated.

    The original dyeing vats required heavy manual labor. During dyeing, two rollers (i.e., cloth winding shafts) on the dyeing vat rotated. The greige fabric passed from the first cloth shaft, absorbed the dye liquor in the dyeing vat, and then wound onto the second cloth shaft. This was considered the first dyeing pass. After the second cloth shaft was full, it had to be reversed and wound back onto the original cloth shaft for the second dyeing pass. Dyeing, adding water, and washing required a total of twenty-two reversals. Each reversal required the workers to exert a great deal of force to push the switch handle. The switch handle required twenty to forty kilograms of force to move. A worker tending two dyeing vats had to reverse the direction over a hundred times in an eight-hour shift. While operating intensely, the workers also had to remember the number of reversals. If they misremembered and dyed one pass too many or too few, the color of the fabric would be inconsistent, resulting in substandard products.

    The automated dyeing vat, which has been successfully tested, uses various automatic devices to replace the work of reversing the cloth shaft and calculating the number of dyeing passes. The worker only needs to lightly push a switch, and the greige fabric can automatically reciprocate on the cloth shaft. Each time a color is dyed, a pointer automatically records the number of passes. After dyeing and washing are completed, the machine automatically stops. Workers are no longer bound by the dyeing vat and can concentrate their efforts on promptly correcting dyeing defects, inspecting the dye liquor temperature, and checking the mechanical operation, thereby ensuring the improvement of product quality.

    After the automation of the dyeing vat, labor productivity has been greatly improved. In the past, one person could only watch two machines, but now they can watch eight. The cost of the product has also been reduced as a result. Calculated based on the annual output of colored cloth in Shanghai, costs can be reduced by over 10 billion yuan.

    For many years, printing and dyeing workers have eagerly desired the automation of dyeing vats, but before liberation, this was only a dream. In the past, although some factories had British and Japanese-style automatic dyeing vats, they either tore the fabric surface or produced uneven colors, so these "treasures" were sent to the warehouse for "long-term rest" one after another. After liberation, various factories successively put forward many creative suggestions for the automation of dyeing vats and conducted experiments. Xiong Miaofa, a maintenance worker at the Huafeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, and technician Xu Zhiren were the first to succeed. The East China Textile Administration and the Shanghai Textile Trade Union provided strong support, and the first automatic dyeing vat was built in November 1952. Subsequently, engineers, technicians, machine operators, and maintenance workers from various printing and dyeing factories were organized to study and improve it. An automatic dyeing vat research and summary working group was established. They summarized the experiences and lessons of various factories and, after seven months of effort, arrived at a solution. Starting last November, it was trial-installed at the Huafeng Printing and Dyeing Factory and has recently been completely successful and has begun to be promoted and applied at the Huafeng factory.

    上海印染工人和技术人员创造自动化染缸
    依靠上海许多印染厂工人、技术人员的集体智慧，印染厂原来用繁重的人工操作的染缸，现在已变为自动化了。
    原来的染缸染色，生活很繁重。染色时，染缸上有两个滚筒（即卷布的轴）在转动，坯布从第一个布轴，通过染缸吸收染液而后卷到第二个布轴，这算是染第一道。第二个布轴卷满以后，就要调过头，卷回原来的布轴，染上第二道颜色。染色加水洗，往返调头共需二十二次。每次调头，工人都要使很大力气去推动开关柄。开关柄要有二十到四十公斤的力量才推得动。一个工人挡两台染缸，工作八小时，要调一百多次头。工人一面紧张地操作，一面还得记住调头的次数，记错了多染或少染一次，布的颜色就会深浅不一，变成次品。
    已经试验成功的自动化染缸，布轴的调向、计算染色的道数等工作，都由各种自动装置来代替了。工人只要轻轻地将开关一推，坯布就能在布轴上自动往返，每染一道色，指针就自动记下道数，染洗完了，机器就自动停止。工人不再为染缸所束缚，可以把力量集中在及时纠正染色疵病，检查染液温度和机械运转情况等方面，因而也就能保证产品质量的提高。
    染缸自动化以后，劳动生产率大大提高，过去一个人只能看两台，现在可看八台；产品成本也因此降低，以上海每年所出的色布来计算，就可降低成本一百多亿元。
    许多年来，印染工人热切想望染缸自动化，可是在解放前这只能是梦想。在以前虽然有些厂曾有过英国式、日本式的自动染缸，可是使用起来，不是布面擦破了，就是颜色深浅不匀，所以这些“宝货”就一台台地被送到仓库里去“长期休息”了。解放后，各厂先后对染缸自动化提出了许多创造性的建议，并曾进行过试验，华丰印染厂保全工人熊妙法和技术人员许智仁首先获得成功。华东纺织管理局和上海纺织工会予以大力支持，在一九五二年十一月份造出第一部自动染缸，随后又组织了各印染厂的工程师、技术员、挡车工人、保全工人等研究改进，成立了自动染缸研究总结工作组，他们总结了各厂经验教训经过七个月努力，得出了一个方案。去年十一月开始，就在华丰印染厂试装，最近已完全成功，并已开始在华丰厂推广应用。
