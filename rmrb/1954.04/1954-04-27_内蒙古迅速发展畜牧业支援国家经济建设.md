Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 26th: The rapidly developing animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is vigorously supporting the country's various economic construction projects. By the end of 1953, the total number of livestock in the region, including horses, cattle, camels, and sheep, had reached over 17.3 million head. Compared to the early days of the Autonomous Region's establishment, the livestock of all ethnic herders has generally more than doubled. In the New Barag Right Banner, the average person owns 102 head of livestock. The development of animal husbandry has not only improved the lives of the vast number of herders, changing the historically extremely impoverished conditions of the pastoral areas, but has also vigorously supported the country's economic and defense construction, and has played a certain role in improving the lives of the people nationwide. According to extremely incomplete statistics, from 1950 to 1953, over 345,000 head of livestock were supplied to various parts of the country, including 56,595 head of cattle, 9,535 horses, and 278,870 sheep and goats; over 13.8 million jin of wool, over 2.6 million jin of cashmere, over 20 million jin of beef and mutton, and over 540,000 hides of various kinds were supplied domestically and exported abroad. This year alone, the Hulunbuir pastoral area will supply 1,200 tons of beef and mutton, 130,000 cattle, sheep, and horse hides, and 2,800 tons of wool to the rest of the country. The vast majority of cattle and horses supplied to various parts of the country are used as draught animals in agricultural areas; the Mongolian horse, with its endurance, is an excellent riding animal; wool, hides, and other livestock products provide abundant raw materials for the country's industrial production.

    Inner Mongolia has 1.2 million dairy cows, which can produce more than 500 million jin of milk annually. Milk can not only be made into various foods such as cream and milk powder, but also into various industrial raw materials. From 1952 to 1953, milk factories distributed throughout the leagues and banners of the Autonomous Region purchased 33 million jin of milk, producing over 1 million jin of cream, 540,000 pounds of milk powder, 660,000 jin of casein (a chemical industrial raw material), and 140 tons of lactose (a pharmaceutical industrial raw material). This year, the output of dairy products will increase by another one-half compared to last year.

    Inner Mongolia has many vast and fertile natural pastures such as Hulunbuir, Xilingol, and Ulanqab. In recent years, 17 state-owned and locally state-owned ranches have been established throughout the region. These state-owned ranches use socialist production methods and scientific animal husbandry techniques to demonstrate to the masses, guiding herders to gradually move towards cooperation. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in animal husbandry is developing steadily. There are now more than 5,000 mutual aid groups of various types in the pastoral areas, and agricultural production cooperatives have emerged this spring. Herders are practicing mutual aid in labor, gradually overcoming the difficulties of insufficient labor and production tools, and increasing production. Some herders in some pastoral areas are also implementing settled nomadism by combining mutual aid, with some people going to nomadic areas and the elderly and young people staying in settled areas to build their homes.

    Now, the herders of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, in the united and loving big family of the motherland, are creating more wealth for the motherland with their hard work and full of confidence.

    内蒙古迅速发展畜牧业支援国家经济建设
　　【新华社呼和浩特二十六日电】内蒙古自治区迅速发展的畜牧业，正有力地支援着祖国各项经济建设。到一九五三年底，全区的马、牛、骆驼、羊等大小牲畜已达一千七百三十多万头，和自治区成立初期相比，各族牧民的牲畜普遍增加了一倍多。在新巴尔虎右翼旗，平均每人拥有一百零二头牲畜。畜牧业的发展，不仅使广大牧民的生活得到改善，改变了历史上极端贫困的牧区面貌，而且有力地支援了祖国的经济建设和国防建设，对改善全国人民的生活也起了一定的作用。根据极不完全统计，从一九五零年到一九五三年，供应国内各地的牲畜达三十四万五千多头，其中包括牛五万六千五百九十五头，马九千五百三十五匹，绵羊、山羊二十七万八千八百七十只；供应国内和向国外输出的羊毛一千三百八十多万斤，羊绒二百六十多万斤，牛羊肉二千多万斤，各种皮张五十四万多张。今年仅呼伦贝尔牧区就要向国内供应牛羊肉一千二百吨，牛、羊、马皮十三万张，羊毛二千八百吨。供应国内各地的牛和马，绝大多数都是供农业区作耕畜；具有持久力的蒙古马，是很好的骑乘工具；羊毛、皮张等畜产品，为祖国的工业生产供给了丰富的原料。
    内蒙古共有一百二十万头乳牛，每年可出产牛奶五亿斤以上。牛奶不仅可制成奶油、乳粉等各种食品，还可制作各种工业原料。一九五二年到一九五三年，分布在自治区各盟、旗的牛奶工厂收购了牛奶三千三百万斤，制出奶油一百多万斤，乳粉五十四万磅，酪胶（化学工业原料）六十六万斤，乳糖（医药工业原料）一百四十吨。今年乳制品的产量又将比去年增加二分之一。
    内蒙古有着呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒、乌兰察布等很多广阔而丰美的天然牧场。近几年来，全区已建立了十七处国营和地方国营牧场，这些国营牧场以社会主义生产方式，科学的畜牧技术向群众示范，引导牧民逐步走向合作化。牧业的互助合作运动正在稳步发展。现在牧区有五千多个各种类型的互助组，今年春季已出现了牧业生产合作社。牧民们实行劳动互助，逐步地克服劳动力和生产工具不足的困难，增加了生产，有些牧区的牧民并以结合互助实行定居游牧，一部分人去游牧，老幼留在定居地建设家园。
    现在，内蒙古各族牧民，在团结友爱的祖国大家庭中，正在以自己辛勤的劳动，满怀信心地为祖国创造更多的财富。
