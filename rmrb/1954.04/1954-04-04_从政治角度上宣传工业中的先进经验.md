    Promoting Advanced Experience in Industry from a Political Perspective
    Jiang Heng
    In newspapers, the promotion of advanced experiences regarding production technology, management methods, and labor organization in industrial production and basic construction is now even more urgent. This year, our country has entered the second year of the Five-Year Plan. On the one hand, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of advanced Soviet experience, the broad masses of workers, with socialist consciousness and a spirit of selfless labor, have created, or are creating, thousands upon thousands of advanced techniques. Many of these have been integrated into widespread advanced experiences that need to be universally learned and promoted. On the other hand, with the surge of industry, many outdated technologies and unreasonable labor organizations need to be reformed. Furthermore, with the emergence of many new technologies and new equipment, people need to learn and master scientific technologies and scientific management methods to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. Precisely because of this, newspapers, as tools for socialist construction, have the responsibility to promote and popularize the advanced experiences of technological innovators in all aspects of industrial production and basic construction, to encourage the advanced, and to motivate the backward. Through this promotion, they should attract more and more workers and technical personnel to fully unleash their enthusiasm, creativity, and initiative in advancing the cause of national industrialization.

    To achieve the goal of mobilizing people through the promotion of advanced experiences, the Party's newspapers must explain the economic and political significance of these experiences. That is, they must, from a political, Party perspective, clarify how these experiences break with outdated and unreasonable production management methods, break with old technical viewpoints, break with old technical norms, old production standards, and old production plans, and establish new scientific production management methods, new and higher technical norms, new and higher production standards, and new and higher production plans; thereby providing society with more products and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. This is the main purpose of promoting advanced experiences and the basic ideological content of newspaper promotion of advanced experiences. Because only by improving labor organization and increasing labor productivity can we ensure our country's successful transition from New Democracy to socialism. Lenin pointed out in "A Great Beginning": "In the final analysis, labor productivity is the most important and principal condition for the victory of the new social system." In recent years, the advanced management methods and advanced technical experiences promoted in our country's patriotic production increase and economy campaign and labor emulation campaign have also paved a broad path for increasing labor productivity, improving product quality, reducing costs, completing and overfulfilling planned tasks, and accelerating the progress of economic construction, etc. Once newspapers grasp these key points and publicize their revolutionary significance in economic and political terms, they can demonstrate a deeper ideological and motivational quality in their reporting of advanced experiences. For example, over the past three years, the Northeast Daily has promoted more than 30 important advanced technical experiences and advanced labor organization experiences in industrial production and basic construction. The reason why some of these advanced experiences have aroused great repercussions among workers in various parts of Northeast China is precisely because the newspaper clarified their revolutionary significance from a political perspective. To take the biggest example, the reason why the experience of the "May 3rd" Factory was able to be widely promoted in the Northeast and become a banner for state-owned enterprises relying on the working class to manage enterprises well is partly because the newspaper systematically explained that it had gained a complete set of enterprise management and Party-masses work experience in mastering the art of leading modern enterprises, establishing a normal order for grassroots work, and combining economic work with political work. These experiences are currently of great significance in promoting the early normalization of grassroots work in factories and mines during the planned economic construction period. Other examples, such as high-speed cutting methods in the machinery industry; multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods; Wang Sunci's parallel flow construction method in basic construction; Zhang Mingshan's technical innovation experience in creating anti-circumferential disks in the mechanization and automation movement; and Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds in completing more than four years' worth of work in one year in the production increase and economy competition, etc., quickly attracted the attention of the entire Northeast and the country, and sparked a mass learning and promotion movement, precisely because the newspaper specifically publicized the creative value of these advanced experiences and their enormous contribution to accelerating the pace of national industrialization.

    In contrast, some reports on advanced experiences, because they are promoted mainly from a purely business and technical point of view, rarely resonate with workers and arouse interest. The Northeast Daily has also published such reports. For example, the May 13, 1953 report on Lin Shitai and others from the Harbin No. 10 Machine Factory successfully learning Kolesov's new tool bit method, only described from a technical point of view what kind of lathe Lin Shitai used, how the new tool bit working method was successfully tested, and how the lathe operator Ning Fu'an and others successfully tested it after receiving training, etc. However, the report did not mention the economic and political significance, characteristics, or conditions for promoting the new tool bit method. Such a purely technical report is not only incomprehensible and undesirable for the general readership, but also unclear to the relevant business departments on where to start learning. The Shanxi Daily also promoted advanced experiences such as the modification method of sulfur smelting furnaces in the "Production Technology Exchange" column, but because it did not explain their significance from a political perspective, and the editors themselves were also "swallowing them whole," the result was that "experts were dissatisfied, and laymen couldn't chew them." Similar phenomena of promoting advanced technology from a technical point of view also exist in the reports of advanced experiences in other newspapers. Many readers find the reports of advanced experiences to be dry and boring because they are "too technical and business-oriented."

    The reason why this problem of being "too technical and business-oriented" has not been well resolved in newspaper work for a long time is mainly because some newspaper workers still lack a complete understanding of the relationship between technical and political nature in reporting ideas. Some comrades believe that reports on economic work, especially advanced experiences, cannot express political and ideological nature because they inherently carry a large technical and business nature. As for readers not understanding and feeling bored, that is their own business. In addition, some comrades believe that newspapers do not need to report advanced technology, that should be the responsibility of professional journals; newspapers only need to publicize its political significance. Obviously, both of these views are one-sided and hinder the further improvement of the promotion level of advanced experiences. It should be understood that technology and politics cannot be separated. Today our technology is in the hands of the people's state and serves the needs of the people and the construction of the motherland. It is in this sense that the creation and promotion of each advanced technical experience cannot but carry profound ideological content and cannot but affect millions of people. For example, Ma Wenzhi's "Rapid Drilling Method" of the Fuxin Mining Bureau is a specialized technical experience in the coal mining industry, but because it can increase drilling efficiency by three times and can rapidly improve resource exploration and geological drilling work, it has a great impact on the development of industries such as ferrous metals, coal, and non-ferrous metals. It cannot be said that readers are not concerned about this impact. As long as the newspaper publicizes this impact and role through the introduction of advanced experiences, it can combine technology and politics, overcome the problem of being "too technical and business-oriented," and arouse readers' interest in reading. Obviously, the view that it is impossible to express ideological nature in reporting advanced experiences is unrealistic. Of course, only talking about political significance without talking about advanced technology is also a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It should be affirmed that advanced technical and management experiences should also occupy a certain position in the Party's newspapers. This is not only because improving technology and labor organization is of extremely great significance in the period of national industrialization, but also because publicizing advanced figures and advanced ideas in industrial construction should mainly be done through advanced experiences in improving technology and labor organization. It is inconceivable that the country can be industrialized without improving technology levels and labor organization; and that newspapers can express advanced ideas in a profound way without advanced technology. Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking and pioneering spirit are mainly reflected in his improved technology, created a "universal tool tire," solved the contradiction of unbalanced equipment in the tool workshop, and greatly improved productivity. If this technical innovation is not stated, and only his advanced thinking is publicized, this publicity will become empty and abstract. On this point, we should not confuse technical nature in reporting with the promotion of technology, these are two different concepts. Readers are dissatisfied with the overly technical nature of reports, mainly because these reports lack ideological nature, not because they deny that newspapers should not promote advanced technical experiences.

    Of course, newspapers, especially Party newspapers, should be different from professional journals in promoting advanced technical experiences. The Party's newspaper is a political newspaper, it should not only promote advanced technical experiences from a political perspective, but also grasp the decisive, universal, and scientific advanced experiences, and analyze, synthesize, and improve them as much as possible. Rationalization proposals and advanced experiences appear every day in various industrial departments. According to incomplete statistics in 1953, more than 24,000 people in Anshan Iron and Steel Company put forward 20,000 major rationalization proposals, and 171 advanced experiences have been promoted in the Northeast basic construction department. There are many other advanced experiences in other industrial departments. Newspapers cannot and do not need to report all of these many rationalization proposals and advanced experiences. This requires newspapers to be good at selecting, not reporting those that are not scientific; not reporting those that are very limited or trivial; and for those decisive advanced experiences that are proposed by individual departments but can be universally applied to other departments, they should not only be reported but also widely disseminated. For example, the recent efforts of the Northeast Daily in disseminating Wang Chonglun's advanced experience is an example. Of course, in the past reports, there have been many instances where the decisive and scientific advanced experiences have not been grasped by many newspapers. The Northeast Daily once focused on improving labor intensity and promoted non-decisive and non-scientific experiences such as "three diligence," "three fasts," and "five wants and five don'ts" in industrial production. Although the Anshan "Worker Life" newspaper paid attention to the promotion of advanced experiences, it rarely made prominent publicity for those decisive advanced experiences; instead, it trivially reported some unimportant experiences and "small tricks." After reading these reports, the workers felt that their thinking was not greatly inspired. The original intention of the newspaper in reporting these experiences was to encourage people to learn, but reports like this cannot achieve the due publicity effect. Therefore, in the promotion of advanced experiences, the Party's newspaper must pay attention to grasping the decisive, universal, and scientific advanced experiences, and overcome the bias of not analyzing and listing phenomena.

    In order to make the promotion of advanced experiences effective, in addition to promoting its economic and political significance, we must also do a good job of ideological criticism in the promotion of advanced experiences. This is an important weapon that newspapers should master in promoting advanced experiences. It should be known that the promotion of advanced experiences is a fierce struggle between new and old ideas. It does not move forward smoothly, but in the struggle, in the development of contradictions, in overcoming these contradictions, and in exposing and eliminating these contradictions. Regarding this issue, Stalin said at the First All-Union Stakhanovite Conference: "This movement was born and expanded to some extent against the will of the management offices of our enterprises, and even in struggle with them. ... Stakhanov himself did not fare much better, because when he moved forward, he not only had to defend himself against certain managers, but also had to defend himself against certain workers who ridiculed and attacked him for his 'innovation.'" The situation that the Soviet Union encountered at that time also exists in our country. That is, some leading personnel of economic organs and trade union organizations disregard advanced experiences and fail to promote them effectively, or only pursue forms and promote them for the sake of promotion; some old engineering and technical personnel and employees still retain bourgeois technical viewpoints, despise the creativity of the working class, and satirize workers for "rushing to the market" and "showing off"; a few workers, especially some new workers, still have narrow-minded conservative ideas, believing that advanced experiences are "impossible to promote" or that there are no "magical tricks" and do not promote them. Under various incorrect ideas, especially the obstruction of bureaucracy and formalism, the work of promoting advanced experiences in many enterprises is in a fluctuating or free-flowing state. This situation shows that treating advanced experiences with bureaucracy and formalism has led to serious losses. It shackles the abilities, initiative, and pioneering spirit of the masses and buries the enormous potential hidden in the working class. This requires the newspaper not to stand aside, but to stand in the struggle, support advanced ideas, expose and eliminate these contradictions, and fight against all bureaucracy, formalism, and conservative thinking in the promotion of advanced experiences. In this regard, the Northeast Daily was more effective in 1951 and 1952. The newspaper once criticized bureaucracy and conservative thinking through the examples of the leaders of the Heilongjiang Forest Industry Bureau and the Shenyang Dye Factory accumulating advanced experiences for up to a year, and supported the revolutionary spirit of advanced workers who insisted on fighting. At the same time, through multiple reports of advanced experiences, it also criticized "condition theory," "spontaneity theory," as well as indifference to advanced experiences, the idea of seeking perfection, and the idea and practice of promoting advanced experiences by simple command methods. This has played a certain role in promoting the promotion of advanced experiences.

    Using newspapers to shout loudly for the creations of the working masses - advanced experiences, creating public opinion, and organizing promotion is a responsibility that newspapers should always bear. However, since the first half of last year, there has been a phenomenon of free flow in the work of promoting advanced experiences in many regions, and the newspaper has not criticized this phenomenon in time. Although this shortcoming and the situation of unfinished reports on advanced experiences are difficult to avoid at the beginning of the country's planned economic construction, the newspaper should strive to improve.

    Learning to promote advanced experiences in improving technology and labor organization from a political perspective is an important link in doing a good job of economic publicity, and it is also one of the most arduous and glorious tasks for newspaper workers. If many newspapers have made many contributions in the past, then in the future, they should play a greater role on the basis of existing achievements.

    从政治角度上宣传工业中的先进经验
    江横
    在报纸上宣传工业生产与基本建设中关于生产技术、管理方法与劳动组织方面的先进经验，在目前是更加迫切了。今年，我国已进入五年计划的第二年，一方面职工群众在党和政府的领导下，在苏联先进经验的帮助下，以社会主义的觉悟和忘我劳动的精神，已经或正在创造着千千万万的先进窍门，并有许多已综合为带普遍性的先进经验，需要人们普遍学习和推广；另一方面，随着工业的高涨，很多陈旧的技术与不合理的劳动组织，需要革新，而很多新的技术和新的设备出现后，更需要人们学习和掌握科学的技术与科学的管理方法，以加速国家的社会主义工业化。正因为如此，作为社会主义建设工具的报纸，就有责任宣传和推广工业生产和基本建设各方面的技术革新者的先进经验，鼓励先进者，带动落后者。并通过这一宣传，来吸引愈来愈多的职工群众和技术人员，在推进国家工业化的事业中充分地发挥他们的积极性、创造性和主动性。
    党的机关报要通过先进经验的宣传，来达到动员人们的目的，就必须说明先进经验的经济意义和政治意义。即必须从政治的、党的观点来阐明它们怎样打破陈旧的不合理的生产管理方法，打破技术的旧观点，打破旧的技术定额，旧的生产标准和旧的生产计划，而创立新的科学的生产管理方法，新的更高的技术定额，新的更高的生产标准，新的更高的生产计划；从而给予社会更多的产品，使人民的物质和文化生活水平获得不断提高。这是推广先进经验的主要目的，也是报纸宣传先进经验的基本思想内容。因为，只有改进劳动组织、提高劳动生产率，才能保证我国从新民主主义胜利地过渡到社会主义。列宁在“伟大的创举”一文中就曾指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”数年来，在我国爱国增产节约运动和劳动竞赛运动中所推广的先进管理方法和先进技术经验，也已为提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低成本，完成和超额完成计划任务，加速经济建设进度等等开辟了广阔的道路。报纸一旦抓住了这些主要之点，宣传了它们在经济上政治上的革命意义，在先进经验的报道中就能表现出比较深刻的思想性和鼓动性。例如，东北日报三年来曾宣传了工业生产和基本建设中三十多种重要的先进的技术经验和先进的劳动组织经验。其中有些先进经验其所以能在东北各地职工中引起很大的反响，正是因为报纸从政治角度上阐明了它们的革命意义。举其最大者来说，“五三”工厂的经验所以能够在东北普遍推广起来，并成为国营企业依靠工人阶级管好企业的一面旗帜，原因之一就是因为报纸比较系统地说明了它在掌握现代化企业的领导艺术，建立基层工作的正常秩序，使经济工作与政治工作相结合等方面，已取得一套企业管理和党与群众工作的完整经验。而这些经验，在目前计划经济建设时期，对于推动厂矿企业基层工作及早走上正常轨道，正具有重大的意义。其他如对于机械工业中的高速切削法；多刀多刃切削法；基本建设中的王孙慈的平行流水施工法；机械化、自动化运动中张明山创造反围盘的技术革新经验，以及增产节约竞赛中王崇伦一年完成四年多工作量的先进事迹，等等，也正是由于报纸具体地宣传了这些先进经验的创造价值，以及对于加速国家工业化进度的巨大贡献，所以很快引起全东北以及全国的注意，并掀起一个群众性的学习和推广运动。
    与此相反，有些先进经验的报道，因为多是从单纯业务和技术的观点出发进行宣传，所以，很难在职工群众中引起反响，发生兴趣。东北日报也发表过这样的报道。如一九五三年五月十三日关于哈尔滨机械十厂林士太等学习科列索夫新式车刀法成功的报道，就是完全从技术的观点出发，叙述林士太使用的是什么车床，新车刀工作法是怎样试验成功的，车工宁福安等人在受训后又是怎样试验成功的，等等。但对于新车刀法的经济政治意义、特点以及推行的条件，报道中却一点也没有谈到。这样纯技术性的报道，不仅广大读者看不懂，不愿看，就是有关业务部门的读者看了，也不知从何学习起。山西日报在“生产技术交流所”专栏内，也宣传过炼磺炉的改装法等先进经验，但因没有从政治角度上说明它们的意义，而编辑人员自己也是“囫囵吞枣”，结果是“内行不满意，外行啃不动”。类似上述这种从技术观点出发来宣传先进技术的现象，在其他一些报纸先进经验的报道中也是存在着。不少读者对先进经验的报道感到枯燥乏味，就是因为“技术性业务性过强”。
    这种“技术性业务性过强”的毛病，长时间在报纸工作中没有能够很好解决，主要是因为有些报纸工作人员，在报道思想上对于技术性和政治性的关系，还缺乏完整的认识。有些同志认为，关于经济工作特别是先进经验的报道，因其本身带有很大的技术性业务性，就无法表现政治性、思想性。至于读者看不懂，感到乏味，那是他们自己的事情。另外有些同志则认为，报纸不需要报道先进技术，那应该是业务刊物的责任；报纸只要宣传它的政治意义就行了。很显然，这两种看法都是片面的，都妨碍着先进经验宣传水平的进一步提高。应该了解，技术和政治是不能分割开的。今天我们的技术是掌握在人民国家的手中，而又为人民的需要服务，为祖国的建设事业服务。正是在这个意义上，每种先进技术经验的创造和推广，就不能不带有深刻的思想内容，就不能不影响着千百万的人们。例如，阜新矿务局马文志“快速钻探法”，虽是煤矿工业中专门性的技术经验，但由于它能使钻探效率提高三倍，能使资源勘察工作和地质钻探工作迅速得到改善，所以对于黑色金属、煤炭和有色金属等工业的发展，都有极大的影响。这种影响不能说读者就不关心。只要报纸通过先进经验的介绍，宣传了这种影响和作用，就能够使技术和政治结合起来，克服“技术性业务性过强”的毛病，而引起读者阅读的兴趣。很显然，那种认为报道先进经验无法表现思想性的观点，是不切实际的。当然，那种只谈政治意义，而不谈先进技术，也是一种因噎废食的作法。应该肯定，先进的技术经验和管理经验，在党的机关报上也是应该占有一定地位的。这不只是因为在国家工业化时期，改进技术和劳动组织有着极为重大的意义，而且因为宣传工业建设中的先进人物、先进思想，也主要应该通过改进技术和劳动组织的先进经验。不能设想，不提高技术水平，不改进劳动组织国家能够工业化；不通过先进技术，报纸能够深刻地表达先进思想。王崇伦的先进思想和首创精神，主要就表现在他改进了技术，创造了“万能工具胎”，解决了工具车间设备不平衡的矛盾，大大提高了生产率。如果不表明他的这个技术革新，而只宣传他的先进思想，这种宣传就会变成为空洞抽象的东西。在这一点上，我们不应该把报道上的技术性和对技术的宣传混为一谈，这是两个不同的概念。读者不满意报道中的技术性过强，主要是因为这些报道缺乏思想性，并不是否定报纸不要宣传先进技术经验。
    当然，报纸特别是党的机关报，在宣传先进技术经验上，应该和专业杂志有所区别。党的机关报是政治报纸，它不只应从政治角度上宣传先进技术经验，而且应抓取具有决定性、普遍性和合乎科学的先进经验，并尽可能地加以分析、综合和提高。合理化建议和先进经验，在各个工业部门中天天都有出现。据一九五三年不完全统计，在鞍山钢铁公司有二万四千多人提出了二万件较大的合理化建议，在东北基本建设部门中已经推广的先进经验有一百七十一种。其他工业部门的先进经验还有很多。对于如此众多的合理化建议和先进经验，报纸不可能也没有必要全部报道。这就要求报纸善于进行选择，不报道不合乎科学的；不报道局限性很大的或很琐碎的；而对于那些虽是个别部门提出，但可以普遍运用到其他部门的带决定性的先进经验，不仅应该报道，并应广为传播。如东北日报最近对传播王崇伦的先进经验所作的努力，就是一个例子。当然，在过去的报道中，没有抓住具有决定性的、合乎科学的先进经验的情况，也是很多报纸发生过的。东北日报就曾一度从提高劳动强度着眼宣传了工业生产中的“三勤”、“三快”、“五要五不要”等非决定性、非科学的经验。鞍山“工人生活”报虽然注意了先进经验的宣传，但对那些带有决定性的先进经验，却很少作突出的宣传；反而琐碎地报道了一些不很重要的经验和“小窍门”。职工群众看了这些报道，觉得对他们的思想没有多大启发。报纸报道这些经验原为鼓舞人们去学习，可是像这样的报道，就不能获得应有的宣传效果。因此，党的机关报在先进经验的宣传中，必须注意抓取带决定性的、普遍性的和合乎科学的先进经验，而克服那种不加分析和罗列现象的偏向。
    要使先进经验的宣传推广工作能够有成效地进行，除了宣传它的经济意义和政治意义外，还必须作好推广先进经验中的思想批判工作。这是报纸在推广先进经验中应该掌握的重要武器。要知道先进经验的推广，是新思想和旧思想的一场激烈斗争。它并不是平平稳稳、一帆风顺地前进，而是在斗争中，在矛盾的发展中，在克服这些矛盾中，在揭露和消灭这些矛盾中进行的。关于这一问题，斯大林在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说中，曾这样说：“这个运动，在某种程度内是违反着我们各企业管理处底意志，甚至是在和他们作斗争中诞生和扩展起来的。……斯达汉诺夫本人底遭遇也并不见得好些，因为他向前进展时不仅必须防御过某些管理人员，并且必须防御过某些因他‘创新立异’而加以讥笑和攻击的工人。”像那时苏联所遇到的这种情况，在我国也是同样存在的。这就是有些经济机关和工会组织的领导人员漠视先进经验，推广不力，或者只追求形式，为推广而推广；有些旧的工程技术人员和职员还残存着资产阶级的技术观点，轻视工人阶级的创造力，讽刺工人“赶行时”、“露手脚”；有少数工人特别是一些新工人还存在着狭隘的保守思想，认为先进经验“没法推广”，或者没有什么“神仙妙道”，不去推广。在各种不正确思想特别是在官僚主义、形式主义的阻碍下，不少企业推广先进经验的工作便处于忽起忽落，或自流状态。这种状况说明了以官僚主义、形式主义对待先进经验的作法，导致了严重的损失。它束缚了群众的能力、主动性和首创精神，埋没了蕴藏在工人阶级中的巨大潜力。这就要求报纸不能站在一旁，必须站在斗争中，支持先进思想，揭露和消除这些矛盾，向推广先进经验方面的一切官僚主义、形式主义、保守思想进行斗争。在这一方面，东北日报在一九五一年、一九五二年曾是作得比较有成效的。该报曾经通过黑龙江森林工业局和沈阳染料厂领导上积压先进经验达一年之久的实例，批判了官僚主义和保守思想，支持了先进工人坚持斗争的革命精神。同时，还通过多次先进经验的报道，批判了“条件论”、“自发论”，以及对先进经验的冷漠态度、求全思想，和用简单命令的方法推广先进经验的思想和作法。这对推动先进经验的推广，曾起了一定的作用。
    运用报纸为工人群众的创造——先进经验大呼大喊，造成舆论，并进行组织推广，这是报纸经常应负有的责任。可是，从去年上半年以来，不少地区在推广先进经验的工作中，曾存在自流的现象，报纸对这种现象也没及时加以批判。这种缺点以及在先进经验报道中有头无尾的情况，虽然在国家开始进入计划经济建设时期，是很难避免的，但报纸还应努力求得改进。
    学会从政治角度上宣传改进技术和劳动组织方面的先进经验是作好经济宣传的一个重要环节，也是报纸工作人员最为艰巨而又光荣的任务之一。如果说过去有不少报纸已经有过很多贡献，那么，今后更应该在既有成绩的基础之上，发挥更大的作用。
