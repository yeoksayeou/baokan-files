The thawed Songhua River has begun shipping.
The ice on the Songhua River has thawed. On April 12th, the first passenger and cargo ship, the "Jinzhou," fully loaded with passengers and supplies needed for the production and livelihood of the people along the river, set sail from Harbin to Zhaoyuan upstream. Other routes will also be opened successively.

The total volume of goods transported on the Songhua River this year will increase by 60% compared to last year, including a large amount of timber transported from the forest area to support national basic construction, bean cake and daily necessities transported from cities to counties along the river for farmers' spring plowing, and new agricultural tools for state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives. Local and sideline products such as pigs, chickens, wool, alkali, and brooms from the rural areas along the river will also be continuously transported from the Songhua River to cities along the river.

In order to complete this year's transportation task, the Northeast Inland Navigation Administration has added cranes and barges to the wharves along the river this year, and will generally use electric light beacons on the routes. The crew members have made various preparations such as repairing ships before the start of navigation. In view of the shortcomings in last year's navigation, they have formulated a responsibility system, found various specific methods, and organized rhythmic navigation according to the indicated charts to improve transportation efficiency.

    解冻了的松花江开始航运
    松花江的冰层已经解冻。四月十二日，第一只客货轮“锦州号”已满载乘客和沿江人民生产、生活上所需要的物资，从哈尔滨开出驶往上游肇源。其他航线也将陆续开航。
    今年松花江上运输的物资总量将比去年增加百分之六十，其中有从林区运出支援国家基本建设的大宗木材，从城市运往沿江各县供农民春耕用的豆饼和日用百货，供国营农场和农业生产合作社使用的新式农具。沿江农村的猪、鸡、羊毛、碱、扫帚等土副产品也将从松花江上源源运往沿江各城市。
    为了完成今年的运输任务，东北内河航运管理局今年在沿江码头上添设了起重机和驳船，在航线中将普遍采用电气灯标照。船员们在开航前做好了修船等各项准备工作。并针对去年航行中的缺点，制订了责任制度，找出种种具体办法，按指示图表组织有节奏航行，提高运输效率。
