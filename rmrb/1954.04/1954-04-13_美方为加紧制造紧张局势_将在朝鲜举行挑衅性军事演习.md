Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 12th: The US side notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on April 8th that the US side will hold large-scale military exercises in Korea. The US side sent a copy of this letter to the Korean-Chinese side on the same day. US Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission, Lacy, said in the letter that the US side "has planned to hold training exercises from April 20 to June 25, 1954." This exercise "will include approximately 4,000 people and their accompanying combat supplies." The exercise troops will board ships in Incheon on the west coast, sail around to Sokcho-ri, north of Yangyang, on the east coast to land, and return to Incheon after two days of activities. The same exercise will be held three times.
The US side's purpose in holding such provocative military exercises on the eve of the Geneva Conference is obviously to intensify the creation of tension, maintain and deepen the unstable state of the Korean armistice, thereby hindering a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    美方为加紧制造紧张局势
    将在朝鲜举行挑衅性军事演习
    【新华社开城十二日电】美方四月八日通知中立国监察委员会：美方将在朝鲜举行大规模的军事演习。美方在同一天将该函的副本送交朝中方面。军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西在该函中说：美方“已计划在一九五四年四月二十日至六月二十五日期间举行教练演习”。这次演习“将包括约四千人及其随同的作战物资”。演习的部队将在西海岸仁川上船，绕到东海岸襄阳以北的束草里登陆，活动两天后返回仁川。同样的演习将举行三次。
    美方在日内瓦会议前夕举行这种挑衅性的军事演习的目的，显然在于加紧制造紧张局势，保持和加深朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，借以阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题。
