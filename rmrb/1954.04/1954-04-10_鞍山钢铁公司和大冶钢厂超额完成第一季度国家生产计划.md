Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Daye Steel Plant Exceed First Quarter National Production Plan

    [Report from this newspaper] Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded the national production plan for the first quarter. The company's total output value in the first quarter exceeded the national plan by 7.4%, an increase of 39.9% over the same period last year and 3.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. Among the company's sixteen major products, the output of more than ten products, including steel ingots, steel billets, large steel, seamless steel pipes, medium steel, small steel, and coke, exceeded the national plan, and the quality all exceeded the national standards. Great achievements have also been made in reducing costs, with the actual cost in February being 5.09% lower than the average actual cost per month last year.
    Currently, the workers and staff of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have formulated the production plan for the second quarter and will strive to produce in April to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day.
    [Report from this newspaper] Daye Steel Plant presents a new look in production this year. The production in the first quarter has exceeded the national plan. Among the eight major categories of products, seven major categories have exceeded the plan, with iron completing 105.19%, steel completing 106.93%, and steel材 completing 109.88%. In the first quarter, the plant directly supported the production and capital construction of 259 units under 14 central ministries and various major regional financial committees, including machinery, railways, and heavy industry, with 49 kinds of high-quality steel and a large number of pig iron, steel ingots, and ordinary steel, including the construction of the Hanshui Railway Bridge and the harnessing of the Huai River.
    Recently, the Rolling Mill Workshop successfully trial-produced the "Anti-Vertical Collar Disc" and has officially put it into production, which has further improved the operating conditions of the small rolling mill. The Bessemer furnace section averaged more than 96 heats per day in March, 21 heats higher than the national quota, and reached more than 100 heats per day for 11 days, laying the foundation for completing one and a half year's plan in one year.
    The above achievements were made because the plant's workers and staff generally received education on the general line since the end of last year, gave full play to their enthusiasm for production, consciously learned from Soviet experience, and implemented the plant leadership's instructions to "overcome the slackness at the beginning of the year and the rush at the end of the year."
    Currently, the leadership of Daye Steel Plant, aiming at the main shortcomings that still exist in completing the first quarter's plan, combined with the second quarter's production tasks, has decided to start from the workshop to gradually establish a production area responsibility system, in order to further consolidate plan management and better complete the second quarter's production tasks.

    鞍山钢铁公司和大冶钢厂超额完成第一季度国家生产计划
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司超额完成了第一季度国家生产计划。该公司第一季度生产总值超过国家计划百分之七点四，比去年同期增加了百分之三十九点九，比去年第四季度增加了百分之三点四。该公司十六种主要产品中有钢锭、钢胚、大型钢材、无缝钢管、中型钢材、小型钢材、焦炭等十多种产品的产量超过了国家计划，质量都超过了国家规定的标准。在降低成本方面也有很大成绩，二月份的实际成本比去年每月的平均实际成本降低了百分之五点零九。
    现在，鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿职工已经订出了第二季度的生产计划，并且要在四月份努力生产，来迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    【本报讯】大冶钢厂今年生产上呈现一片新气象。第一季度的生产已超额完成了国家计划。八大类产品中，有七大类都超额完成了计划，其中铁完成百分之一百零五点一九，钢完成百分之一百零六点九三，钢材完成百分之一百零九点八八。在第一季度里，该厂以四十九种优质钢与大批生铁、钢锭、普通钢材，直接支援了机械、铁道、重工业等中央十四个部与全国各大区财委所属的二百五十九个单位的生产与基本建设，其中包括兴建汉水铁桥，根治淮河等建设工程。
    最近轧钢车间试制“反立围盘”成功，并已正式投入生产，更使小型轧钢机操作条件得到改善。贝氏炉工段三月份平均达到日炼九十六炉多，比国家定额高二十一炉，有十一天还达到日炼一百炉以上，为一年完成一年半的计划打下了基础。
    获得以上这些成绩，是该厂职工从去年年底开始普遍受到了总路线的教育，发挥了生产积极性，自觉地学习苏联经验，并贯彻了该厂领导上“克服年初松气，年底突击”的指示的成果。
    现在，大冶钢厂领导上，正针对完成第一季度计划中尚存在的主要缺点，结合第二季度生产任务，决定从车间着手逐步建立生产区域责任制，以进一步巩固计划管理更好地完成第二季度生产任务。
