Guangdong Province achieved a widespread bumper harvest of sweet potatoes (also known as yams) planted on six million mu of land last winter. The estimated average yield across the province increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year.

Last winter's weather was relatively warm, which was suitable for sweet potato growth. After receiving education on the General Line, farmers in various parts of Guangdong, in order to save more staple grains to support national industrial construction, requested an increase in sweet potato production to supplement insufficient food rations. They generally applied more fertilizer to the sweet potato fields than in the past. Some farmers in the western Guangdong region even applied plant ash when cultivating and turning the vines of the sweet potatoes. Farmers in Zhongshan County in central Guangdong applied fish scales or shrimp bran as base fertilizer to the sweet potato fields. Therefore, sweet potato production has generally increased throughout the province this year. The average yield in the western Guangdong region is over 600 jin per mu, an increase of about 20%. In some areas, such as the fourth district of Haikang County, the sweet potato yield per mu last year was 700 to 800 jin, but this year it has increased to about 1,300 jin. In Weilu Township, Leidon County, the families with the highest yields harvested more than 10,000 jin, while those with the lowest yields harvested 3,000 to 4,000 jin. This has played a significant role in helping farmers overcome the spring famine. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东省冬种蕃薯丰收
    广东省去冬种植的六百万亩蕃薯（即甘薯，俗称山芋），普遍获得丰收，估计全省的产量平均比去年增产一成到两成。
    去冬天气较为暖和，适宜蕃薯生长。广东各地农民经过总路线教育后，为了节约更多的主粮支援国家工业建设，都要求增产蕃薯，以补助口粮的不足。他们对蕃薯地的积肥、施肥一般都比过去为多。粤西区有的农民在蕃薯的中耕翻蔓时，还施上草木灰；粤中区中山县有的农民在蕃薯地上施上了鱼麟或虾糠做基肥。因此今年全省各地蕃薯普遍增产。粤西区平均每亩产量都在六百斤以上，约增产两成。个别地区如海康县第四区去年每亩蕃薯产量是七百斤到八百斤，今年提高到一千三百斤左右；雷东县蔚律乡每户收成最多的有一万多斤，少的也有三、四千斤。这对帮助农民渡过春荒，起了很大作用。（李少球）
