    Heighten Revolutionary Vigilance
    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee called on the whole Party to strengthen unity and be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage of our Party's unity.
    Our Party, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, is united, consolidated, and sound. This unity has been developed and consolidated in the process of overcoming various contradictions within the Party and has withstood the test of history. It is precisely by relying on this unity that the Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve victory in the New Democratic Revolution. The unity of the Party is the life of the Party, and it is necessary to continue to strengthen the unity of the Party. Because only with the unity of the Party can we achieve the unity of the working class, the unity of the working people, and the unity of the people of the whole country; without this unity, we cannot victoriously carry out the great cause of socialist revolution—socialist transformation.
    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee pointed out that building our country into a great socialist country is a more profound and extensive revolution than the New Democratic Revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and it contains extremely complex and extremely sharp struggles. In this struggle, we must not ignore two basic objective facts: first, the encirclement of imperialism still exists. This encirclement is not only military, but primarily political. The imperialists and their lackeys in Tokyo, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places are not sleeping there; they are trying to sabotage our cause at all times; second, the domestic classes that have been overthrown will never be reconciled to their demise, and the classes that will be eliminated will not be without resistance. The resolute counter-revolutionaries among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism and carry out various sabotage activities in an attempt to make the Chinese revolutionary cause fail and restore reactionary rule in China. The primary target of the enemy's sabotage activities is the leading force of the people of our country in carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, that is, our Party, the unity of our Party; the main method of the enemy's sabotage activities is to find their agents within our Party. Because the enemy understands that the fortress is easiest to break from the inside.
    We must remember historical lessons deeply. In China, the enemy once found their agents within our Party, the most famous of whom were Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. In the Soviet Union, Russian and international counter-revolutionary forces not only found Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, but also, after these traitors were eliminated, found a criminal group such as Beria as their agents. In Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, incidents of this nature also occurred after the victory of the revolution. In Yugoslavia, because the imperialists found the Tito clique as agents, the Yugoslav revolution failed, the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie was restored, and the liberated Yugoslavia lost its independence again and actually became a colony of imperialist countries. Such major historical lessons show that the enemy must not only find their agents in the Communist Party, but also have found them, and may still find some unstable, disloyal, and even ulterior motives as their agents in the future.
    The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session pointed out that after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, some cadres in the Party developed an extremely dangerous sense of pride. If we lack sufficient understanding and vigilance about the danger of this sense of pride and cannot carry out vigorous criticism and correction, then the ideological style of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will spread in the weak parts of our Party and play a corrosive, disintegrating, and divisive role in our Party; if we do not resolutely stop the individualistic pride that has appeared in the Party, they will step by step calculate their position in the Party, fight for power and profit, engage in small group activities, and even become bourgeois individualistic careerists, embarking on the criminal path of helping the enemy to sabotage and split the Party; the enemy may find their agents in our ranks. Therefore, when the class struggle is becoming more tense and complicated, we must not be paralyzed, complacent, and indifferent because of victory; on the contrary, we must draw lessons from the reality and history of the class struggle to heighten revolutionary vigilance.
    Because our Party is already a victorious Party, a ruling Party, and because the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong has extremely high prestige among the people of the whole country, the enemies of the Party and the people—counter-revolutionaries, speculators, and bourgeois individualistic careerists hiding in the Party—can no longer and rarely carry out activities to sabotage and split the Party in an open manner. Their sabotage activities must adopt two-faced tactics, hiding under the banner of the Party's correct line, disguising themselves, and carrying them out secretly. This is one of the important characteristics of the enemy hidden in the Party today in carrying out activities to sabotage the Party.
    One of the methods they adopt is to carry out sectarian activities. Although they outwardly admit that our Party is a unified and fighting Party of the proletariat, they maliciously distort it in secret. They abandon the cadre policy of both ability and integrity stipulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and identify and select cadres according to personal likes and dislikes and loyalty to individuals. Those who they like or are loyal to them personally are promoted, and those who dare to adhere to the truth and expose their evil deeds and the mistakes in the work they lead are excluded and attacked. Because what they talk about and what they do is ugly and dirty, and cannot see the light of day, they dare not approach upright cadres with both ability and integrity. They are good at pulling and dragging people. If they intend to win over a certain person, they casually promise official positions, flatter them, and say good things about this person in front of others in order to make this person feel grateful for their kindness and fall into the trap; sometimes they use the weaknesses of certain people to win them over, or first attack them and then win them over, in order to achieve their goal of creating sectarianism.
    Another method they adopt is to fabricate rumors, slander, and sow discord, and use various gaps to create disunity within the Party. For example, they use certain shortcomings or mistakes in the Party's work, or the individual shortcomings or mistakes of comrades, to fabricate rumors and slander, turning non-principal issues into principal issues, unimportant issues into important issues, and individual, temporary, and corrected shortcomings and mistakes into systematic and consistent ones. They are accustomed to creating contradictions within the Party, saying one thing to A and another to B, saying one thing to C and another to D, being two-faced and three-edged, deceiving superiors and subordinates, reversing black and white, and sowing discord. In order to achieve the goal of sabotaging and splitting the Party, they can even completely fabricate rumors out of thin air and spread them everywhere. Their shameless activities may also be disguised as criticism and self-criticism, but in essence, they have nothing in common with our Party's criticism and self-criticism. Because they do not start from unity, but from division, looking for opportunities to develop personal ambitions.
    Still another method they adopt is to disrespect the Party's unified leadership and regard the region or department they lead as an independent kingdom. Because they have personal ambitions, they exaggerate personal roles in their work, emphasize personal prestige, regard the achievements of the Party's work as personal achievements, and are therefore full of pride, arrogant, undisciplined, and domineering. Their work can only be praised, not criticized. They reject the supervision of the masses from below. Whoever criticizes him, he hates whoever. When they report their work to the Party, they only report good news and not bad news, and they are extremely unwilling for the Party to inspect their work. When the people who inspect the work from above find shortcomings in their work, they do not take a warm and welcoming attitude but think that their secrets have been exposed, and use various excuses to refuse to accept the correct opinions of the inspectors, and even give the inspectors difficulties and attacks. In the region or department they lead, they try their best to cultivate personal forces and improve personal prestige, instead of consolidating and improving the prestige of the Party's leadership, and even intentionally undermining the prestige of the Party. They do not regard the region and department they lead as a part of the unified whole of the whole Party and the whole country, but regard it as their private property, and attempt to use it as their capital and tool to realize their individualistic ambitions to sabotage and split the Party.
    Can we say that all comrades in our Party have enough vigilance against these attempts and conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries, speculators, and bourgeois individualistic careerists hidden in the Party to sabotage and split the Party? No, we cannot say that. Many comrades in our Party, including some senior cadres, lack the necessary revolutionary vigilance and political sensitivity. Therefore, they cannot sharply identify and resist certain words and deeds that are unfavorable and harmful to the unity of the Party, so that those conspirators who attempt to sabotage and split the Party still have room for activities. This is something we must be seriously vigilant about. Comrade Mao Zedong once called on all comrades in the Party to improve their sense of smell, "to sniff everything with their noses, identify their good and bad, and then decide whether to welcome it or resist it." This should be the motto of all comrades in our Party.
    In order to enhance the unity of the Party and smash the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage and split the Party, it is necessary to carry out a struggle in the Party against erroneous ideological tendencies such as individualism, liberalism, sectarianism, decentralism, and localism. The individualism of the bourgeoisie is incompatible with the collectivism of the proletariat. People with individualistic ideas often cannot correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the Party organization, and the relationship between the individual and the masses. If they are not careful, they may do some things that are detrimental to the unity of the Party. What is especially worth vigilance is that people with individualistic ideas may be used by counter-revolutionaries, speculators, and careerists who attempt to sabotage and split the Party. Liberalism is harmful to the unity of the Party, and it can make the Party's organization lax and disintegrate. Because liberals lack serious principles, they may say some things that are unfavorable to the unity of the Party and do some things that are unfavorable to the unity of the Party. What is especially worth vigilance is that liberals are easily captured and used by hostile elements who attempt to sabotage and split the Party, and consciously or unconsciously become the megaphone for their remarks that sabotage the unity of the Party and become the tool for their activities that sabotage the unity of the Party. Sectarianism is incompatible with the Party's unity and unity. People with sectarian sentiments are prone to doing things that are detrimental to the unity of the Party. It is precisely such people that the enemies of the Party are looking for to carry out their sectarian activities. People with sectarian sentiments, if they are not vigilant and do not correct their shortcomings, may be hooked and even embark on the criminal path of helping the enemy to sabotage and split the Party. Decentralism and localism are also extremely harmful to the unity of the Party. People who have committed the mistakes of decentralism and localism are also the targets of careerists who attempt to sabotage and split the unity of the Party. If they are not vigilant enough, they may also be used by them. Therefore, all people with erroneous ideological tendencies such as individualism, liberalism, sectarianism, decentralism, localism, and departmentalism should raise their awareness, heighten their vigilance, correct their shortcomings, and overcome their mistakes. The less this non-proletarian ideological sentiment in the Party, the less likely it is for the enemy to carry out activities to sabotage the unity of our Party. Therefore, we should continue to carry out the struggle against this erroneous ideological tendency in the Party.
    Comrades of the whole Party should eliminate paralysis and credulity, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, heighten vigilance, improve their sense of smell, fight against the enemies who attempt to sabotage the unity of the Party, and fight against all phenomena that are unfavorable to the unity of the Party. Revolutionary vigilance is a noble quality that every Communist Party member must possess. Revolutionary vigilance is our weapon against all enemies. We must always polish this weapon and be ready to take action at any time, then all the enemy's conspiracies will surely fail.

    提高革命警惕
    党的四中全会号召全党加强团结，警惕敌人对我们党的团结的破坏。
    我们的党在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下是团结的、巩固的、健全的。这种团结是在征服党内各种矛盾的过程中发展和巩固起来的，是经过了历史的考验的。正是依靠了这种团结，党领导全国人民取得了新民主主义革命胜利。党的团结是党的生命，必须继续增强党的团结。因为只有党的团结，才能达到工人阶级的团结、劳动人民的团结和全国人民的团结；没有这种团结，我们便不能胜利地进行社会主义革命——社会主义改造的伟大事业。
    党的四中全会指出，要把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，我们决不可忽略了两个基本的客观事实，第一，帝国主义的包围仍然存在着。这种包围不但是军事上的，而且首先是政治上的。在东京、台湾、香港和其他地方的帝国主义者及其走狗们并不是在那里睡觉，他们无时无刻不在企图破坏我们的事业；第二，国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义相互勾结起来，进行各种破坏，以图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。敌人破坏活动的首要目标，就是我国人民进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的领导力量，就是我们的党，我们党的团结；敌人破坏活动的主要方法，就是在我们党内寻找他们的代理人。因为敌人懂得：堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。
    历史的教训我们必须深刻地记取。在中国，敌人在我们党内曾经找到过他们的代理人，其中最著名的是陈独秀和张国焘。在苏联，俄国和国际的反革命势力不但找到过托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子和布哈林分子，而且在这些叛徒被消灭以后，还找到过像贝利亚这样的反党反苏的罪恶集团作为他们的代理人。在捷克斯洛伐克，在保加利亚，在匈牙利，在革命胜利后，也曾发生过这种性质的事件。在南斯拉夫，由于帝国主义者找到了铁托集团作为代理人，就使南斯拉夫的革命归于失败，使资产阶级的反动统治复辟，使已经获得了解放的南斯拉夫又丧失了独立，实际上变成了帝国主义国家的殖民地。这样重大的历史教训表明，敌人不但一定要在共产党内寻找他们的代理人，而且曾经找到过，在今后也还可能找到某些不稳定的、不忠实的、以至别有企图的分子作为他们的代理人。
    四中全会决议指出，在新民主主义革命胜利后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪。如果我们对这种骄傲情绪的危险性缺乏足够的认识和警惕，不能进行有力的批判和纠正，那么，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想作风就会在我们党的薄弱部分传布起来，就会在我们党内起一种腐蚀、瓦解和分裂的作用；如果对党内出现了的个人主义的骄傲的人们而不坚决加以制止，他们就会一步一步地从在党内计较地位，争权夺利，拉拉扯扯，发展小集团活动，直至成为资产阶级个人主义野心家，走上帮助敌人来破坏党分裂党的罪恶道路；敌人就有可能在我们队伍中寻找到他们的代理人。所以，当阶级斗争正趋于紧张化、复杂化的时期，我们决不可因为胜利而麻痹，而自满，而漠不关心；相反地，我们必须从阶级斗争的现实和历史中吸取教训来提高革命警惕性。
    由于我们的党已经是胜利的党，执政的党，由于党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导在全国人民中有极高的威信，党和人民的敌人——隐藏在党内的反革命分子、投机分子和资产阶级个人主义野心家，已不可能和很少用公开面目来进行破坏党分裂党的活动。他们的破坏活动必然是采取两面手法，躲在党的正确路线的旗帜下，伪装起来，偷偷摸摸地来进行。这是隐藏在党内的敌人今天进行破坏党的活动的重要特点之一。
    他们所采用的方法之一就是进行宗派活动。他们虽然在表面上承认我们的党是无产阶级的统一的战斗的党，但在暗地里却恶意地加以歪曲。他们抛弃党和毛泽东同志规定的才德兼备的干部政策，按照个人的好恶和对个人的忠诚来识别和挑选干部，凡是他们所喜好的或对他们个人忠诚的就加以提拔，凡是敢于坚持真理，揭发他们的恶行和他们所领导的工作中的错误的，就予以排斥和打击。因为他们所谈的话，所做的事，是丑恶的，是龌龊的，见不得阳光，所以不敢亲近正直的才德兼备的干部。他们对人善于拉拉扯扯。如果他们打算拉拢某一个人的时候，就随便封官许愿，加以奉承，在旁人面前说这个人的好话，以便使这个人感其知遇之恩，落入圈套；有时则利用某些人的弱点，对其加以笼络，或者先予以打击，而后笼络，借以达到他们造成宗派的目的。
    他们所采用的另一种方法就是造谣中伤，挑拨离间，利用各种空隙制造党内不和。譬如，他们利用党的工作上的某些缺点或错误，或者同志们的个别缺点或错误，进行造谣中伤，把非原则问题说成是原则问题，不重要的问题说成是重要问题，个别的、暂时的、已经改正了的缺点和错误说成是系统的、一贯的。他们惯于在党内制造矛盾，逢甲说乙，逢丙说丁，这里一套，那里一套，两面三刃，欺上蒙下，颠倒黑白，进行挑拨离间。为了达到破坏党分裂党的目的，他们甚至还可以完全无中生有地制造谣言，到处传播。他们的这种无耻活动，也可能挂上批评和自我批评的幌子，但实质上与我们党的批评和自我批评没有丝毫共同之点。因为他们不是从团结出发，而是从分裂出发，寻找发挥个人野心的机会。
    他们所采用的再一种方法，是不尊重党的统一领导，把自己领导的地区或部门看作是独立王国。因为他们有个人野心，所以在工作中便夸大个人作用，强调个人威信，把党的工作成绩看做是个人的成绩，并因此而骄气十足，自高自大，目无法纪，飞扬跋扈。他们的工作只能表扬，不能批评。他们拒绝群众的自下而上的监督。谁要是批评了他，他就仇视谁。他们在对党报告工作时，有喜无忧，并且极不愿意党检查他们的工作。当上级检查工作的人发现了他们工作中的缺点时，他们不是采取热烈欢迎的态度而是认为揭了他们的底，用各种口实拒绝接受检查人的正确的意见，甚至给检查人以非难和打击。他们在自己领导的地区或部门，极力培植个人势力，提高个人威信，而不去巩固和提高党领导的威信，甚至有意地破坏党的威信。他们不是把自己领导的地区和部门看做是全党、全国统一的整体中的一个部分，而把它看做是自己的私产，并妄图以此作为他们实现破坏党分裂党的个人主义野心的资本和工具。
    对于隐藏在党内的反革命分子、投机分子和资产阶级个人主义野心家的这些破坏党分裂党的企图和阴谋活动，能不能够说我们全党同志都有足够的警惕呢？不，不能够这样说。我们党内的许多同志，包括某些高级干部在内，是缺乏应有的革命警惕性和政治敏感的。因此，他们对某些不利于和有害于党的团结的言行，就不能锐敏地识别出来，加以抵制，以致那些企图破坏和分裂党的阴谋分子还有活动的余地。这是我们必须引起严重警惕的。毛泽东同志曾经号召全党同志提高嗅觉，“对于任何东西都用鼻子嗅一嗅，鉴别其好坏，然后才决定欢迎它，或者抵制它”。这应当成为我们全党同志的座右铭。
    为了增强党的团结，粉碎敌人破坏党分裂党的阴谋活动，必须在党内开展反对个人主义、自由主义、宗派主义、分散主义、地方主义等等错误思想倾向的斗争。资产阶级的个人主义是与无产阶级的集体主义不相容的。有个人主义思想的人往往不能正确地处理个人与党的组织的关系，个人与群众的关系，若不小心，就可能作出一些不利于党的团结的事情来。尤其值得警惕的是，有个人主义思想的人，就可能被企图破坏党分裂党的反革命分子、投机分子和野心家所利用。自由主义是损害党的团结的，它可以使党的组织涣散和瓦解。因为自由主义者缺乏严肃的原则性，因此就可能说出一些不利于党的团结的话，做出一些不利于党的团结的事。尤其值得警惕的是，自由主义者很容易为企图破坏党分裂党的敌对分子所俘掳，所利用，自觉地或不自觉地成为他们破坏党分裂党的团结的言论的传声筒，成为他们破坏党的团结的活动的工具。宗派主义是与党的团结、统一不相容的。有宗派情绪的人就容易做出有损于党的团结的事。党的敌人正是要寻找这样的人来进行他们的宗派活动的，具有宗派情绪的人，如果不加警惕，不纠正自己的缺点，就有可能被钓上钩，直至走上帮助敌人来破坏党分裂党的罪恶道路。分散主义、地方主义也都是极端有害于党的团结的。犯有分散主义、地方主义错误的人，也正是企图破坏党分裂党的团结的野心家所要笼络的对象，如果警惕不够，也可能为其利用。所以一切有个人主义、自由主义、宗派主义、分散主义、地方主义、本位主义等等错误思想倾向的人都应当提高觉悟，提高警惕，纠正缺点，克服错误。党内这种非无产阶级的思想情绪愈少，则敌人进行破坏我们党的团结的活动的可能性愈小。所以我们应在党内继续不断地开展反对这种错误思想倾向的斗争。
    全党同志要消灭麻痹与轻信，加强马克思列宁主义学习，提高警惕，提高嗅觉，向企图破坏党的团结的敌人进行斗争，向一切不利于党的团结的现象进行斗争。革命警惕性是每一个共产党员所必须具备的高贵品质。革命警惕性是我们对付一切敌人的武器。我们要经常擦亮这个武器，随时准备采取行动，那么敌人的一切阴谋一定会遭到失败。
