Paving the Way for Mechanization of Carpentry
Huang Rongchang Carpentry Workshop Achieves Full Mechanization

The Huang Rongchang Carpentry Workshop of Factory 101 achieved full mechanization at the end of February, paving the way for the mechanization of carpentry operations. Now, manual operations such as sawing, cutting, drilling, and grooving in the Huang Rongchang Carpentry Workshop have been completely replaced by machinery. Workers operate the thirty-three machines they created to carry out production. Workers who originally used manual operations have now become workers who master machinery.

In February of last year, Huang Rongchang and the group he led created twelve machines, which partially mechanized carpentry operations. In order to further improve equipment, after launching a production increase and savings labor competition in September of last year, the Huang Rongchang Carpentry Workshop put forward the goal of developing carpentry operations from partial mechanization to full mechanization. With the help of workers such as Xu Zhanrong from the machine shop, they first learned techniques such as turning and fitting, laying a technical foundation for carrying out full mechanization. After someone proposed an improvement initiative, they jointly researched it within the group, dividing up design, drafting, finding parts, and matching tools. The leadership of Factory 101 also transferred a fitter to help them install the machines. By the end of last year, they had newly installed nine machines. Now, the entire workshop has thirty-three machines; the carpenters have completely freed themselves from heavy physical labor, and labor productivity has greatly improved. Putting all thirty-three machines into production can create more than 5 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year. Recently, the Huang Rongchang Carpentry Workshop also put forward the slogan of gradually achieving automation on the existing basis, and they will also help the factory's masonry team and kiln team to gradually implement mechanization.

    为木工操作机械化开辟道路
    黄荣昌木工房实现全面机械化
    一零一厂黄荣昌木工房在二月底实现了全面机械化，为木工操作机械化开辟了道路。现在黄荣昌木工房的锯料、断料、钻眼、拉槽等手工操作已全部为机械所代替。工人们操纵着自己创造的三十三部机器进行生产，原来用手工操作的工人，现在变成掌握机械的工人了。
    去年二月间，黄荣昌和他领导的小组创造了十二部机器，使部分木工操作机械化。为了进一步改进设备，黄荣昌木工房在去年九月间展开增产节约劳动竞赛以后，提出了将木工操作从部分机械化发展到全面机械化的奋斗目标。他们在机工车间工人徐占荣等的帮助下，首先学习了车工、钳工等技术，为开展全面机械化打下了技术基础。有人提出改进的倡议以后，他们就在小组内共同研究，分工设计、绘图，找零件，配工具。一零一厂领导方面还调了一个钳工去帮助他们装设机器。到去年年底，他们就新安装了九部机器。现在全工房已有三十三部机器；木工房的工人们已完全摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，劳动生产率大为提高。这三十三部机器全部投入生产，每年可为国家多创造五十多亿元的财富。最近，黄荣昌木工房又提出了要在现有基础上逐步实现自动化的口号，他们并将帮助该厂泥工班、窑工班逐步实行机械化。
