Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 25th: The Indian people welcome the Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina.

    Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, issued a statement supporting the Geneva Conference and called on the Indian people to hold an "Asia Day" on April 25th. He said: "Let this day be the beginning of a great national unity, a unity that can turn the anger against American policies in Asia into a powerful bulwark of peace."

    He said: "This unity will not only help to issue a stern warning to the American warmongers and strengthen Asian solidarity, but also contribute to the success of the upcoming Geneva Conference, which is the focus of attention of progressive humanity."

    On the evening of the 24th, about four hundred workers in Delhi held a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in New Delhi to express their support for the Geneva Conference and strongly protest against American conspiracies in Asia. The demonstration was organized by the Delhi branch of the All-India Trade Union Congress, and the leaders of the demonstration were well-known trade union leaders in Delhi, including Ya. Du. Sharma and A.K. Nanda, among others.

    The demonstrators carried red flags and many placards with slogans such as: Wishing the Geneva Conference success, demanding a ban on hydrogen bombs, withdrawing American "observers" in Kashmir, condemning the attempts of imperialists to form war blocs in Asia, and demanding support for the struggle of the people of French India and Portuguese India for freedom, etc. They shouted slogans demanding friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and China, and with peace-loving people all over the world.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: According to reports from newspapers in Rangoon, leaders of many people's organizations in Burma unanimously hope that the Geneva Conference will help to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina. They pointed out that the efforts of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to strive for peace have been warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world. U Ba Nyein, political director of the headquarters of the Burma Workers and Peasants Party, pointed out to the press on the 19th that the reason the United States is engaging in activities to sabotage the Geneva Conference is because it fears that the conference may reach agreements that lead to world peace. The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Rangoon Peace Committee will prepare to convene a mass peace conference to express their support for the Geneva Conference.

    印度缅甸两国人民欢迎举行日内瓦会议
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度人民欢迎举行日内瓦会议以和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平。
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士发表声明支持日内瓦会议，并号召印度人民在四月二十五日举行“亚洲日”。他说：“让这一天成为伟大的民族团结的开始，这种团结可以使反对美国的亚洲政策的愤怒情绪成为强有力的和平堡垒。”
    他说：“这种团结不仅有助于对美国战争贩子提出严厉的警告和加强亚洲的团结，同时也有助于进步人类所集中注意的即将举行的日内瓦会议的成功。”
    在二十四日晚上，德里工人约四百名在新德里美国大使馆前面举行示威游行，表示支持日内瓦会议，并强烈抗议美国在亚洲的阴谋。这次示威是全印总工会德里邦分会组织的，示威的领导人是德里的著名工会领袖，包括雅·杜·夏尔马和阿·克·南达等人。
    示威者拿着红旗和许多标语牌，上面写着：祝日内瓦会议成功、要求禁止氢弹、撤出美国在克什米尔的“观察员”、谴责帝国主义者在亚洲成立战争集团的企图，要求支持法属印度与葡属印度人民争取自由的斗争等。他们高呼口号，要求与苏联和中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民友好。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据仰光报纸消息，缅甸许多人民团体负责人一致希望日内瓦会议有助于和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平。他们指出，苏联和中华人民共和国争取和平的努力，已获得全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。缅甸工农党总部政治主任吴巴迎十九日对报界发表谈话指出，美国之所以进行破坏日内瓦会议的活动，是因为它害怕在会议中可能达成导致世界和平的协议。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会和仰光和平委员会将筹备召开一个和平群众大会，以表示支持日内瓦会议。
