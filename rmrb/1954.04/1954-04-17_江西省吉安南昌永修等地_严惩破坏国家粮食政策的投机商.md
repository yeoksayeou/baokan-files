    Severe Punishment for Speculators Undermining National Grain Policy
    The unscrupulous merchants Huang Hemei and Wang Jixiu in Ji'an City, Jiangxi Province, have consistently engaged in grain speculation activities. After the state implemented the planned purchase and supply of grain, they continued to use methods such as fraudulently purchasing and rush-buying to undermine the national grain policy. The unscrupulous merchant Huang Hemei fraudulently purchased 400 jin of rice and seven bags of flour from the state grain department. After being exposed, the government issued a warning, but he continued to engage in illegal activities. It was not until the third inspection that he was found to be hoarding grain. When the state carried out the unified purchase of grain last winter, the unscrupulous merchant Wang Jixiu moved his wife and children back to his old home in Futian, Jishui County, in an attempt to refuse to sell the grain he had hoarded under the pretext of increasing the agricultural population. After being exposed by the masses, his plot failed. Since then, he has been buying and selling oil crops such as peanuts in Futian and other places, and frequently evaded national taxes. Before the Spring Festival, when the state supplied a large amount of flour, he asked his wife and children to fraudulently purchase and rush-buy flour from state-owned stores and cooperatives twenty times, attempting to transport it to the countryside and sell it at high prices in order to seize illegal profits.
    After verifying the facts of the crimes based on reports from the masses, the Ji'an City People's Court convened a mass public trial in March and sentenced Huang Hemei to two years imprisonment and Wang Jixiu to one and a half years imprisonment on the spot.

    Zhou Jibo, the owner of the Yangjiachang grain consignment shop in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, has consistently failed to abide by the state's consignment contract since he started consigning grain for the state, and has undermined the state's grain supply work through illegal activities such as using short weights, adulteration, and selling grain illicitly. Residents who bought rice from the store often found that it was one or two jin short. Even worse, he mixed rice swept from the ground with sand, soil, dirt, and broken glass into the good rice and sold it to the masses, replacing it with good rice and embezzling it for illegal sale. After the government investigated and found out about these illegal activities, he wrote false guarantees on the one hand and threatened another shareholder not to confess his mistakes honestly on the other. In order to educate all grain consignment shops in the city and ensure the implementation of the national grain planned purchase and supply policy, the Nanchang City People's Court has arrested and punished the criminal.

    Hu Chuan'er, an unscrupulous merchant in Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, is an unscrupulous merchant who has consistently engaged in speculation and sabotage. In mid-February of this year, he went to various villages near Shijiadang, Xingzi County, fraudulently purchased more than 300 jin of flour and oily noodles, transported it to Tujiapu, Yongxiu County, and sold it at a price 18 percent higher than the state-owned listed price, deducting two liang per jin, exploiting the masses, and undermining the national grain policy and market management. In March, the Yongxiu County People's Court convened a mass public trial and sentenced the criminal to one and a half years imprisonment.

    江西省吉安南昌永修等地
    严惩破坏国家粮食政策的投机商
    江西省吉安市不法奸商黄和美、王积修一贯进行粮食投机活动，国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应以后，他们仍继续用套购、抢购等办法来破坏国家粮食政策。奸商黄和美曾向国家粮食部门套购四百斤大米、七袋面粉；经人揭发，政府对他提出警告后，仍继续进行非法活动。直到第三次对他进行检查，仍发现有囤积粮食行为。奸商王积修在去冬国家进行粮食统购工作时，将老婆子女迁回吉水县阜田老家，企图以增加农业人口为名拒卖所囤积的粮食，经群众揭发，阴谋未遂；此后他在阜田等地贩买花生等油脂作物，经常偷漏国税。春节前国家大量供应面粉时，他叫老婆子女分向国营商店和合作社套购、抢购面粉二十次，企图运往农村高价出售，以攫取非法利润。
    吉安市人民法院根据群众的检举，把该两犯犯罪情节调查属实后，在三月间召开群众公审大会，当场判处黄和美二年徒刑，王积修一年半徒刑。

    江西省南昌市杨家厂粮食代销店老板周继勃，自从为国家代销粮食以来，一贯不遵守国家委托代销的合约，用短秤、掺杂、盗卖等不法行为，破坏国家粮食供应工作。居民向该店买米，经常发现少一、二斤。更恶劣的，是他竟将从地上扫起的大米连沙带土及污泥、碎玻璃片等掺在好米内卖给群众，从中换出好米，侵吞盗卖。该犯这些不法行为，经政府查获后，他还一面写假保证，一面威胁另一股东不坦白认错。为了教育全市粮食代销店和保障国家粮食计划收购和计划供应政策的贯彻执行，南昌市人民法院已将该犯逮捕惩办。
