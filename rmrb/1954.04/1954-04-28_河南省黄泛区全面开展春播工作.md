Spring sowing work has been fully launched in the Yellow River flood area of Henan Province. This area is now a rich granary. Last year, Xihua and Fugou counties alone produced more than 500 million jin of grain.

To increase grain production even further, tens of thousands of laborers have again repaired the Sha River, which runs through the entire area, and planted 700,000 trees to eliminate sandy wasteland this spring. The People's Government has also guaranteed the supply of grain to grain-deficient households. Cotton farmers are expanding their cotton acreage. Xihua County has expanded its cotton acreage by more than 11,000 mu this year compared to last year.

To ensure that the masses sow on time, the county grain bureau supplied more than one million jin of mung bean, soybean, sorghum, and millet seeds. The county supply and marketing cooperative purchased more than 100 head of cattle from Nanyang, which were snapped up by the farmers.

The Ling Heini and Gao Yumei agricultural producers' cooperatives had their spring sowing successfully completed by the state's agricultural machine tractor station. This year, the two cooperatives plan to sell 155,000 jin of grain and 3,400 jin of ginned cotton to the state. The state-owned Yellow River Flood Area Mechanized Farm, which is loved by the farmers in the Yellow River flood area, completed 13,900 mu of spring land plowing and harrowing in March. The farm's 5,500 mu of cotton have now been sown. To increase cotton production, the staff carefully selected improved varieties and compacted the cotton fields before sowing. The masses around the farm enthusiastically helped the farm select seeds, and the farm also selected more than 100,000 jin of high-quality "S" cotton seeds to supply to farmers who lacked seeds.

In mid-April, Soviet agricultural expert Rosov personally visited the Yellow River flood area to hold discussions with farmers and conducted research and guidance on the work of the farm and the tractor station. (Lü Jianzhong)

    河南省黄泛区全面开展春播工作
    河南省黄泛区的春耕播种工作全面展开了。这里现在已是一片富饶的米粮川，去年仅西华、扶沟两县就生产粮食五亿斤以上。
    为了更多地增产粮食，今春数万民工又修治了横贯全境的沙河，并栽树七十余万株消灭沙荒。人民政府又保证了对缺粮户的粮食供应。棉农纷纷扩大棉田面积，西华县今年比去年扩大棉田一万一千多亩。
    该县粮食局为保证群众按时下种，供应了绿豆、黄豆、高粱、谷子种籽百余万斤。该县供销合作社从南阳购来一百多头耕牛，被农民争购一空。
    凌黑妮、高玉梅两个农业生产合作社由国家的农业机器拖拉机站代耕，春季播种已胜利完成。两社今年计划卖给国家十五万五千斤粮食和三千四百斤皮棉。黄泛区农民所热爱的国营黄泛区机耕农场，三月份就完成了一万三千九百亩春地的犁耙工作，全场五千五百亩棉花现已播种完毕。为了棉花增产，职工们在播种前就认真做好了精选良种和棉田镇压工作。农场周围群众热情地到农场帮助选种，农场也选出十余万斤优良的“斯”字棉种供给缺种的农民。
    四月中旬苏联农业专家罗索夫曾亲到黄泛区与农民进行座谈，并对农场和拖拉机站的工作做了研究和指导。（吕建中）
