In order to prepare for the convening of local people's congresses at the county level and above, and for the election of deputies to the National People's Congress, after the successful completion of the grassroots election work across the country, the following decisions are made on several issues concerning the convening of provincial, municipal, and county people's congresses. These were passed at the fourth meeting of the Central Election Committee and the 213th Government Administration Council meeting on April 15, 1954.

I. The provincial, municipal, and county people's congresses shall be convened by the people's governments at their respective levels, citing the provisions of Article 1 of the "Organizational Rules for Provincial People's Representative Conferences," the "Organizational Rules for Municipal People's Representative Conferences," and the "Organizational Rules for County People's Representative Conferences."

II. The current provincial, municipal, and county people's congresses will not elect their respective people's governments at their first meeting.

If there are special circumstances requiring the re-election of the people's government at the county level, it shall be submitted to the people's government at the next higher level for approval; its organization shall temporarily follow the original form.

III. The convening time of the provincial, municipal, and county people's congresses, in order to ensure that the representative candidates stipulated in Articles 47 and 49 of the Electoral Law can be fully deliberated, and at the same time to ensure that the convening of people's congresses at all levels are connected, is generally stipulated as follows:

\t1. County-level people's congresses shall be convened in June 1954;

\t2. Provincial and municipal people's congresses are tentatively scheduled to be convened in late July or early August 1954;

\t3. People's congresses of industrial cities under provincial jurisdiction with a population of more than 500,000 should be convened before the provincial people's congress.

IV. Deputies to the National People's Congress for industrial cities under provincial jurisdiction with a population of more than 500,000 shall not be elected by the municipal people's congress, but shall be elected by the provincial people's congress together.

　　中央选举委员会、中央人民政府政务院对于召开省、市、县人民代表大会的几个问题的决定
    （一九五四年四月十五日中央选举委员会第四次会议和政务院第二百一十三次政务会议通过）
    全国基层选举工作即将胜利完成，接着就要召开县以上地方各级人民代表大会。为了对地方各级人民代表大会的召开和对全国人民代表大会代表的选举作好准备，特就召开省、市、县人民代表大会的几个问题，作出如下的决定。
    一、省、市、县人民代表大会分别援引“省各界人民代表会议组织通则”、“市各界人民代表会议组织通则”、“县各界人民代表会议组织通则”第一条的规定，由其本级人民政府召开。
    二、省、市、县本届人民代表大会，不在首次会议选举其本级人民政府。
    县一级的人民政府如有特殊情况必须改选者，应报经上一级人民政府批准；其组织暂照原有的形式。
    三、省、市、县人民代表大会的召开时间，为使选举法第四十七条、第四十九条规定的代表候选人都能得到充分的酝酿，同时使各级人民代表大会的召开互相衔接起见，一般规定为：
    1、县一级人民代表大会在一九五四年六月间召开；
    2、省、市人民代表大会暂定在一九五四年七月下旬或八月上旬召开；
    3、人口在五十万以上的省辖工业市的人民代表大会应先于省人民代表大会召开。
    四、人口在五十万以上的省辖工业市应选到全国人民代表大会的代表，不由市人民代表大会选出，而由省人民代表大会一并选出。
