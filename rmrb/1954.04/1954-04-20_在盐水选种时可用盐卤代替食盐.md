    Editor's Note: After receiving letters from comrades Ju Naipu and Pan Rilian, we discussed the matter with the General Bureau of Agricultural Production of the Ministry of Agriculture. The General Bureau of Agricultural Production believes that the suggestions of comrades Ju Naipu and others are very good and can be promoted in areas near salt-producing areas where salt brine is abundant. In the past, some areas also used salt brine for seed selection, but this was not common. Now is the sowing season, and in order to do a good job in selecting seeds carefully, this practice can be appropriately promoted in areas where conditions permit.
    Salt brine can be used to replace table salt when selecting seeds with salt water
    Ju Naipu and Pan Rilian from the Qu County Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Zhejiang wrote: Based on our experience in promoting agricultural technology over the past year: cultivating strong seedlings is one of the keys to increasing production, and salt water seed selection is the main link in cultivating strong seedlings. However, according to our experiments, an agricultural cooperative with about 200 mu of land needs 300 to 400 jin of salt water for salt water seed selection; this requires about 70 jin of table salt to prepare, costing about 100,000 yuan. Individual farmers, because of decentralized operations and small seed quantities, spend even more table salt when preparing salt water. Therefore, many farmers reflect that salt water seed selection is a good thing, but it uses too much salt and is not easy to do.
    How to solve this problem? We considered it for a long time. Later, after hearing that the Quzhou China Salt Industry Company had more than 3,000 jin of salt brine in storage, we thought of using salt brine instead of table salt. We changed from using 100 jin of clean water plus 15 jin of table salt to 100 jin of clean water plus 40 jin of salt brine, which not only achieved the standard concentration of table salt preparation but also did not affect the germination rate. This reduced farmers' expenses, created favorable conditions for the wider promotion of salt water seed selection, and saved the state's table salt while utilizing accumulated salt brine. Taking the Quzhou Farm as an example, this year a total of 2,000 jin of seeds were used. If table salt was used for salt water seed selection, more than 80 jin would be needed, worth more than 100,000 yuan; now, by using more than 200 jin of salt brine, it only costs more than 20,000 yuan. At the same time, salt brine is a liquid, which is easier to dissolve evenly than table salt when preparing, making it easier for farmers to operate.
    It is currently the sowing season, and we suggest that all localities appropriately use salt brine instead of table salt when promoting salt water seed selection.

### 在盐水选种时可用盐卤代替食盐

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：我们收到居乃普、潘日链两同志的来信后，曾和中央农业部农业生产总局商讨。农业生产总局认为，居乃普等同志的建议很好，在产盐区附近，盐卤较多，可以推广。过去有些地区也有采用盐卤选种的，但还不普遍。现在正是播种季节，为了做好精选种籽的工作，有条件的地区可以适当推广这个做法。
    在盐水选种时可用盐卤代替食盐
    浙江衢县农业技术推广站居乃普、潘日链来信：根据我们一年来推广农业技术的经验：培育壮秧是增产的关键之一，而盐水选种则是培育壮秧的主要环节。可是，据我们试验，一个有二百亩左右土地的农业社，盐水选种时需要三、四百斤盐水；这要用七十来斤食盐配制，需人民币十万元左右。单干农民因为分散经营，种子数量少，配制盐水时就更费食盐。因此，不少农民反映：盐水选种是好事，就是用盐太多，不易作到。
    如何解决这一问题呢？我们考虑了很久。后来听说衢州中国盐业公司存有三千多斤盐卤，就想到利用盐卤来代替食盐。我们由原用一百斤清水加十五斤食盐改为一百斤清水加盐卤四十斤，不但浓度能达到食盐配制的标准，而对发芽率也没有影响。这样减少了农民开支，为更广泛地推行盐水选种创造了有利条件，并且节省了国家的食盐和利用了积压着的盐卤。以衢州农场为例，今年共用种子二千斤，盐水选种时如用食盐需要八十多斤，值人民币十万多元；现在改用盐卤二百多斤，仅需两万多元。同时，盐卤是一种液体，配制时比食盐容易溶化均匀，更便于农民操作。
    目前正是播种季节，我们建议各地在推行盐水选种时适当采用盐卤来代替食盐。
