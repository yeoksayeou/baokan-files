Xinxing Village, in the Seventh District of Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, recently mobilized the masses to carry out grain adjustment work, successfully solving the problem of grain shortage households and promoting spring plowing preparations.

After Xinxing Village completed the grain unified purchase work, the grain problem of the entire village could be basically solved within the village if all the grain could be adjusted well. However, because some people did not understand the state's grain policy well enough, surplus grain households did not dare to sell grain, and grain shortage households were afraid of not being able to buy grain, so production enthusiasm was not high.

After learning about this situation, the work group sent by the CPC Ning'an County Committee to Xinxing Village mobilized farmers to adjust grain on their own. They first carried out key pilot work within the large-scale mutual aid group led by the secretary of the CPC village branch. The work group and village cadres thoroughly and comprehensively publicized the policy of unified grain purchase and sale within this mutual aid group. After Zhang Shiyuan, a surplus grain household, further understood the state's grain policy, he happily sold 2,100 jin of surplus grain. Eight surplus grain households in the group sold a total of 4,500 jin of grain, thus smoothly solving the problems of food shortage and seed grain for the seven group members. The entire village used the same method to complete the grain adjustment work in three days. Thirty-nine surplus grain households sold a total of 18,500 jin of surplus grain, basically solving the food problem of grain shortage households in the whole village. Bie Yuhuan, a farmer, originally had no interest in working all day long because of food shortage. After adjusting the grain supply, he said, "I don't have to worry about not having enough to eat anymore!" and he worked with great energy. Other households that were originally short of grain also actively devoted themselves to spring plowing preparations.

    松江宁安县新兴村发动群众调剂粮食
    松江省宁安县第七区新兴村最近发动群众开展粮食调剂工作，顺利解决了缺粮户的吃粮问题，对春耕准备工作起了推动作用。
    新兴村结束粮食统购工作以后，全村所有粮食如果调剂得好，吃粮问题在本村内就能基本上解决。但是由于有些群众对国家的粮食政策不够了解，余粮户不敢卖粮，缺粮户怕买不着粮食，因此生产情绪不高。
    中共宁安县委会派在新兴村的工作组了解到这一情况后，就发动农民自行调剂粮食。他们首先在中共村支部书记领导的大型互助组内进行了重点试验工作。工作组和村干部在这个互助组内深入、全面地宣传了粮食统购统销政策。余粮户张士元进一步了解了国家的粮食政策以后，高兴地卖出二千一百斤余粮。全组八家余粮户共卖出四千五百斤粮食，组内七户组员缺口粮和种籽的问题因而顺利解决。全村用同样作法在三天时间内完成了粮食调剂工作。三十九户余粮户共卖出一万八千五百斤余粮，基本上解决了全村缺粮户的吃粮问题。农民别玉寰原来因为缺吃粮成天没有心思干活，调剂粮食后，他说：“再也不用愁没吃的啦！”干起活来特别有劲。其他原来缺粮的户也都积极投入春耕准备工作。
