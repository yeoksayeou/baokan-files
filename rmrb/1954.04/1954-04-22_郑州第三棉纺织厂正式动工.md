    Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill Officially Breaks Ground
    The state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill, which began construction this year, officially broke ground on April 16th. The Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Mill is twice the size of the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, which was built last year and is now undergoing trial production. Its civil construction will also be more solid and beautiful than the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill. The roof of its main factory building will not be laid with earthen tiles, but will be made entirely of high-quality, lightweight asbestos tiles that are heat-insulating and fireproof. The skylights of the main factory building will all be fitted with steel windows.
    Although the scale of this factory is twice that of the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, the construction time, according to national requirements, is the same as the construction time of the No. 1 factory. It is planned that by the end of this year, all civil engineering work will be completed except for the chemical flooring of the large factory building. Machine installation can begin after October this year. The Engineering Company of the Central-South Textile Industry Administration, which is responsible for the factory construction, will increase the degree of mechanization in construction this year. Dozens of machines are installed in the company's newly established mechanized woodworking and decoration workshop. The two hundred plus workers operating these machines are equivalent to the manual labor of more than 37,000 people.

    郑州第三棉纺织厂正式动工
    今年开始建设的国营郑州第三棉纺织厂在四月十六日正式动工了。郑州第三棉纺织厂比去年建设的、现在正在试车生产的郑州第一棉纺织厂的规模大一倍；土木建筑也将比郑州第一棉纺织厂更加坚固优美，它的主厂房的屋面将不用土瓦铺设，完全用质量好、分量轻、并能隔热防火的石绵瓦；主厂房的天窗将全部安设钢窗。
    这个厂的规模虽比郑州第一棉纺织厂大一倍，但它的建设时间，按照国家的要求，却和第一厂的建厂时间相等。计划到今年年底，除大厂房化学地板外，土建工程将全部完工；今年十月以后，即可进行机器安装。担负建厂任务的中南纺织工业管理局工程公司今年将提高施工中的机械化程度。公司新建立的机械化木工装修车间里安装有几十台机器，由二百多个工人操纵这些机器，就相等于三万七千多人的手工劳动。
