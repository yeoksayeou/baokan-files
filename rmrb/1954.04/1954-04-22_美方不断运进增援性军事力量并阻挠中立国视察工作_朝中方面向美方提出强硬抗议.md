Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. The Military Armistice Commission recently received a comprehensive report and review from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the entry and exit of military personnel and war materials of both sides into Korea during October and November 1953. On April 15, the Military Armistice Commission received a report signed by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the US side's restrictions and obstruction of the work of the neutral nations inspection teams in the US-controlled areas. These important documents of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission specifically listed many facts with conclusive evidence, once again exposing the US side's serious violation of the armistice agreement. Disregarding repeated protests from the Korean and Chinese sides and repeated exposures by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the US has continued to transport reinforcing military forces for a long time and has done everything possible to restrict and obstruct the work of the neutral nations inspection teams, making it impossible for them to carry out effective supervision and inspection in the US-controlled areas.

At the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held its 41st meeting on April 20. At the meeting, Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho of the Korean and Chinese side lodged a strong protest against the above-mentioned illegal acts of the US side in seriously violating the armistice agreement, and pointed out that the purpose of these continuous illegal acts of the US side is obviously to expand military forces and maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, thereby hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho finally solemnly pointed out that, in order to stabilize the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the US side must immediately cease all restrictions and obstructions to the neutral nations inspection teams working in the US-controlled areas, and immediately cease the entry of reinforcing military forces to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement.

The full text of Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho's main speech at the Military Armistice Commission on April 20 is as follows: "The Military Armistice Commission has received the comprehensive report and review of rotation and replacement during October and November 1953 from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. On April 15, the Military Armistice Commision also received a report submitted to the Military Armistice Commission by the Polish and Czechoslovak members, concerning your side’s limitations and obstruction of the neutral nations inspection teams’ work in your area. These reports and reviews fully illustrate that since the armistice, your side has continuously and continuously violated the armistice agreement by bringing in reinforcing military forces. At the same time, due to your side's various restrictions and obstructions, the neutral nations inspection teams are unable to carry out effective supervision in your area.

The report of April 15, signed by the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, stated: ‘The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission believes that the right of neutral nations inspection teams to board ships is very important and necessary for effective supervision and inspection, and the Commission has so instructed the various neutral nations inspection teams. However, in a letter dated October 6, the United Nations Command prohibited the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from boarding ships in all southern ports. Due to the above-mentioned interference by the United Nations Command, ships at various ports have been placed outside of supervision and inspection. In this way, the various neutral nations inspection teams cannot conduct effective supervision of the replacements for which they are responsible.’

The report cited instances in Busan and Incheon where your side refused to allow the neutral nations inspection teams to open and inspect the boxes. It must be pointed out that your side refuses to report the parts and disassembled components of war materials, and at the same time refuses to allow the opening of the boxes to inspect the contents. The intention is self-evident. The report said: ‘Since the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission cannot conduct full inspections of the ports, it cannot guarantee that reinforcing war materials restricted by the armistice agreement have not been transported into Korea.’

On January 20, 1954, a serious incident restricting the activities of the teams occurred in Incheon. Your side notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in Incheon by order: ‘The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is not allowed to conduct its inspection in the port on the afternoon of January 20 and the morning of January 21.’ Your side even stated that, according to the orders of your commander, even if the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission requested to enter the port, ‘the team should be prohibited from doing so.’ The report clearly pointed out that ‘This interference by the United Nations Command is a serious violation of the armistice agreement.’

Your side’s restrictions and obstructions of the work of the neutral nations inspection teams have even developed into insults, intimidation, beatings, and kidnappings of team members. For example, Larson, the Swedish secretary of the team in Daegu, was brutally beaten, Jagielnicki, the Polish member of the team in Incheon, was attempted to be persecuted, and Hadukiewicz, the Polish personnel of the team in Gangneung, was openly kidnapped.

Your side violated the clear provisions of the armistice agreement that replacements must be carried out on the basis of the same type, the same performance, and one-for-one basis, and disregarded the decisions and requirements of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, refusing to provide the subtypes of warplanes that your side enters and exits Korea, refusing to provide reports on your side’s military forces entering and exiting Korea to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, and adopting various deceptive methods when providing reports, reporting more when entering and less when exiting, not reporting entry and exit when the team is present, and carrying out a large number of illegal entry and exits when the team is not present, attempting to transport reinforcing military forces by muddling through. Just a few examples can clearly show this situation. For example, on December 9, 1953, your side concealed the entry of warplanes. According to the report of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in your port, your side illegally transported at least nine warplanes that day. In October 1953, your side only shipped out 74 landing vehicles and 331 .30 caliber carbines, but your side reported to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that it shipped out 145 landing vehicles and 1,441 .30 caliber carbines, attempting to transport in 71 more landing vehicles and 1,110 carbines in this way.

Paragraph 13(m) of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that both sides shall provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams in the performance of their duties and tasks; Paragraph 13(n) stipulates that both sides shall guarantee that all members and other personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission enjoy the freedom and convenience necessary for the proper performance of their duties; Article 43 stipulates that the neutral nations inspection teams stationed at designated ports shall be given full access to the areas and traffic routes stipulated in the Armistice Agreement; Article 47 stipulates that the commanders of both sides shall actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to comply with all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement in letter and spirit. Your side’s various restrictions and obstructions to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have undeniably violated the above-mentioned provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

The report signed by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission clearly pointed out: ‘The inspection and observation activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have been restricted, obstructed and violated by the United Nations Command, and this situation is becoming increasingly serious, because at the same time the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at the southern ports have sent a large number of reports saying that the United Nations Command has repeatedly violated the provisions of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcing warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into Korea.’

The various reports of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission not only confirmed that your side has frequently and continuously violated the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcing military forces since the armistice, but also explained why your side has long restricted and obstructed the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in your area. Disregarding our repeated protests and the repeated exposures of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, your side continues to violate the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcing military forces, and restricts and obstructs the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams from performing their duties. Your side’s purpose is obviously to expand your military forces in order to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, thereby hindering the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. I once again lodge a strong protest against your side’s illegal acts.

In order to stabilize the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, your side must immediately cease all restrictions and obstructions to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams working in your area, and immediately cease the entry of reinforcing military forces to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement."

    美方不断运进增援性军事力量并阻挠中立国视察工作
    朝中方面向美方提出强硬抗议
    【新华社开城二十日电】军事停战委员会最近收到中立国监察委员会提出的关于一九五三年十月及十一月期间双方军事人员与作战物资进出朝鲜的综合报告及审定。四月十五日，军事停战委员会收到中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员署名提出的关于美方限制与阻挠中立国视察小组在美方地区的工作的报告。这些中立国监察委员会的重要文件具体列举了许多证据确凿的事实，又一次揭露了美方严重违反停战协定，不顾朝中方面多次的抗议与中立国监察委员会多次的揭发，长期以来继续不断地运进增援的军事力量，并百般限制与阻挠中立国视察小组的工作，使它们无法在美方地区进行有效的监督和视察。
    在朝中方面建议召开之下，军事停战委员会在四月二十日举行第四十一次会议，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上对美方上述严重违反停战协定的非法行为提出强硬的抗议，并指出：美方这些继续不断的非法行为的目的，显然是在于扩大军事力量，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，借以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。李相朝中将最后严正指出：为了朝鲜停战的稳定并有利于和平解决朝鲜问题，美方必须立即停止对于在美方地区工作的中立国视察小组的一切限制与阻挠，立即停止进入增援的军事力量以保证停战协定的执行。
    李相朝中将在四月二十日军事停战委员会上的主要发言全文如下：“军事停战委员会收到了中立国监察委员会关于一九五三年十月及十一月期间轮换替换的综合报告和审定。四月十五日，军事停战委员会又收到了中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员署名的关于你方限制和阻挠中立国视察小组在你方地区的工作向军事停战委员会提出的报告。这些报告和审定充分说明了自停战以来，你方长期继续不断地违反停战协定，运入增援的军事力量；同时，由于你方百般限制和阻挠，中立国视察小组在你方地区无法执行有效的监察。
    中立国监察委员会波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员署名的四月十五日的报告中指出：‘中立国监察委员会认为中立国视察小组上船的权利对于进行有效的监督和视察是非常重要和必要的，委员会并已如此地指示了各中立国视察小组。但是联合国军方面在十月六日的信中禁止了在所有南方各口岸的中立国视察小组上船，由于联合国军方面的上述干涉，在各口岸的船只已被置于监督与视察之外。这样，各中立国视察小组对他们所负有责任的替换就不能进行有效的监察’。
    报告中举出在釜山和仁川都发生过你方拒不允许中立国视察小组开箱视察，必须指出，你方一面拒绝报告作战物资的零件和拆散件，一面又拒绝不许开箱视察箱子里的内容，用意何在是不言而喻的。报告中说：‘中立国视察小组对各口岸既不能进行充分监察，从而也就不能保证停战协定所限制的增援性作战物资没有被运入朝鲜’。
    一九五四年一月二十日，仁川发生了严重的限制小组活动的事件，你方以命令的方式通知驻仁川的中立国视察小组说：‘一月二十日下午与一月二十一日上午不准中立国视察小组在港口进行其视察’。你方甚至表示：根据你方司令官的命令，即使中立国视察小组提出要求进入港口‘也要禁止小组这么做’。报告中明白指出：‘联合国军方面的这种干涉是对停战协定的一项严重违反’。
    你方限制和阻挠中立国视察小组的工作，甚至发展到对小组人员进行侮辱、威吓、殴打和绑架。如在大邱凶殴小组瑞典秘书拉尔逊，在仁川企图迫害小组波兰组员雅盖尔尼茨基，在江陵公开绑架小组波兰人员哈都克耶维赤。
    你方违反停战协定关于替换必须在同种类、同性能、一件换一件的基础上进行的明确规定，并不顾中立国监察委员会的决定和要求，拒绝提供你方进出朝鲜的作战飞机的副型，拒绝依照协议的规定向中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组提供你方进出朝鲜的军事力量的报告，而在提供报告时则采取种种欺骗蒙混的办法，运进时以多报少，运出时以少报多，小组在场时不报进出，小组不在场时则大量进行非法的进出，企图这样混水摸鱼运进增援的军事力量。仅仅随手举几个例子就可以明显地看出这种情况，例如，一九五三年十二月九日那一天，你方隐瞒不报作战飞机的进入，而依照驻在你方口岸的中立国视察小组的报告，那天你方至少非法运入九架作战飞机。一九五三年十月份内，你方共只运出登陆车七十四辆，零点三口径卡宾枪三百三十一枝，但你方却向中立国监察委员会报告运出登陆车一百四十五辆，零点三口径卡宾枪一千四百四十一枝，企图这样可以多运进登陆车七十一辆，卡宾枪一千一百十枝。
    停战协定第十三款午项规定，在中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组执行其职司与任务时，双方应给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作；同款酉项规定，双方应保证中立国监察委员会的所有委员及其他人员均享有为适当执行其职司所必需的自由与便利；第四十三款规定，驻在指定口岸的中立国视察小组须给予停战协定所规定的地区内及交通通道上的充分的通行便利；第十七款规定，双方司令官须与中立国监察委员会积极合作以求得对停战协定全部规定的文字与精神的遵守；你方对于中立国视察小组的种种限制与阻挠无可置辩地违反了停战协定的上述各项款的规定。
    中立国监察委员会捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员署名的报告中已明确指出：‘中立国视察小组的视察和观察活动受到了联合国军方面的限制、阻挠和侵犯，这种情况正日趋严重，因为与此同时在南方各口岸的中立国视察小组送来了大批报告说，联合国军方面将增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药运入朝鲜，而一再地违反了停战协定第十三款卯项的规定’。
    中立国监察委员会的各项报告不仅证实了停战以来你方经常不断违反停战协定运进增援的军事力量，而且说明了为什么你方长期以来限制并阻挠中立国视察小组在你方地区内的工作。你方不顾我方多次的抗议以及中立国监察委员会的多次揭露，继续违反停战协定运进增援性的军事力量，并限制和阻挠中立国视察小组执行其职司，你方的目的显然是为了扩大你方军事力量，来保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，借以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，对于你方这种非法行为我再一次向你提出强硬的抗议。
    为了朝鲜停战的稳定并有利于和平解决朝鲜问题，你方必须立即停止对于在你方地区工作的中立国视察小组的一切限制与阻挠，立即停止进入增援的军事力量以保证停战协定的执行。”
