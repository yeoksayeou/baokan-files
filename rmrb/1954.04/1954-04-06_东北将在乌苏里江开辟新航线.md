    The Northeast Inland Waterway Transportation Administration has decided to open a shipping route on the Ussuri River this year, with regular passenger and cargo ships running between Jiamusi and Raohe. This plan will give the Ussuri River a new look.
    The upper reaches of the Ussuri River merge with the Songacha River flowing from Lake Xingkai, converge with the Muling River through Hulin, and then converge with the Naoli River through Raohe, flowing into the Heilongjiang River at the delta downstream of Fuyuan, with a total length of over 900 li. This river can directly navigate to major inland rivers such as the Heilongjiang River, Songhua River, and Nen River.
    The Ussuri River area has abundant forestry resources, with the largest reserves of pine and linden trees; it is also rich in wool, leather, ginseng, deer antler, deer fetus, and bear bile. In the past, due to the limitations of backward transportation conditions, these useful resources could not be quickly and cheaply transported to the cities, and the needs of the people along the river for industrial products and daily necessities could not be met. In the future, with the opening of the new shipping route on the Ussuri River, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas will be further promoted, bringing happiness to the people along the river.

    东北将在乌苏里江开辟新航线
    东北内河航运管理局，决定今年在乌苏里江开辟一条航线，在佳木斯至饶河间定期开行客货轮船。这个计划将会使乌苏里江出现一个新的面貌。
    乌苏里江上流与兴凯湖流出的松阿察河合流，经虎林汇合穆棱河，又经饶河汇合挠力河，至抚远下游三角洲流入黑龙江，全长九百多里。这条江可以直接通航到黑龙江、松花江、嫩江等各大内河。
    乌苏里江沿岸拥有丰富的林业资源，其中松木和椴木的蕴藏量最多；还盛产羊毛、皮革、人参、鹿茸、鹿胎和熊胆等。过去由于落后的交通条件限制，这些有用的资源，不能迅速地廉价地运到城市，同时也不能满足沿江人民对工业品和日用品等等的需要。今后将随着乌苏里江新航线的通航，进一步促进城乡物资交流，给沿江人民带来幸福。
