Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman for the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the 3rd that from March 30th to April 2nd, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated one battalion and nine companies of enemy troops while attacking enemy strongholds in Dien Bien Phu. The majority were European and African soldiers. The People's Army controls four of the five hills east of Muong Thanh, the center of the French army's entrenched group in Dien Bien Phu, directly threatening French airfields and headquarters.

After the French army's northern defenses in the Dien Bien Phu entrenched group were destroyed by the People's Army, they reinforced Muong Thanh, turning it into a strong defensive center. Therefore, the defenses east of Muong Thanh were extremely important, as the five hills to the east were several defensive strongholds protecting the airfield and enemy headquarters. On the afternoon of March 30th, the People's Army launched a second offensive against Dien Bien Phu, capturing the French strongholds on three hills that night and forcing the French army to abandon the fourth hill. On March 31st, the enemy sent reinforcements from Muong Thanh to the fifth hill. That night, the enemy launched several counterattacks, attempting to retake the other hills, but were repelled by the People's Army and suffered heavy losses.

On the evening of April 1st, the People's Army captured an enemy stronghold northwest of the Dien Bien Phu entrenched group that shielded the airfield. The garrison of this stronghold consisted of European and African soldiers. On the evening of the 2nd, the People's Army also surrounded a second stronghold west of Muong Thanh, forcing two companies of Thai puppet troops to surrender.

The People's Army artillery struck many enemy ammunition depots. Three enemy aircraft were shot down by the People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery units.

The People's Army now completely controls most of the hills in the eastern part of the Dien Bien Phu French army entrenched group and controls part of the Muong Thanh plain connected to the airfield.

The enemy airlifted 150 soldiers overnight to reinforce the Dien Bien Phu garrison, which was in dire straits. Many of them have been killed or captured by the People's Army.

    越人民军四天歼灭奠边府敌军一营又九连
    控制法军东部防线大部，直接威胁法军机场和司令部
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人三日宣布：越南人民军三月三十日至四月二日在进攻奠边府的敌军据点时，歼灭敌军一个营和九个连，其中大部分是欧非军。人民军控制了奠边府法军集团据点的中心芒清以东五个小丘中的四个，直接威胁着法军的机场和司令部。
    法军在奠边府集团据点的北部防线被人民军摧毁以后，就增援芒清，把它变成强固的防御中心，因此芒清东部的防御显得十分重要，因为东部的五个小丘是保卫着机场和敌军司令部的几个防御据点。三月三十日下午，人民军向奠边府发动了第二次进攻，当夜拔除三个小丘上的法军据点；并迫使法军放弃第四个小丘。三月三十一日，敌人从芒清向第五个小丘增派援军。当晚，敌军发动多次反扑，企图夺回其他的小丘，但都被人民军击退，遭受重大损失。
    四月一日晚，人民军拔除了在奠边府集团据点西北掩护机场的一个敌军据点。这个据点的守军是欧非籍兵士。二日晚上，人民军又包围了芒清以西的第二个据点，迫使两连泰族伪军投降。
    人民军的大炮击中敌军的许多弹药库。三架敌军飞机被人民军高射炮部队击落。
    人民军目前已完全控制了奠边府法军集团据点东部几个小丘的大部分，并控制了和机场相连的芒清平原的一部分。
    敌人连夜空运一百五十名兵士增援被打得焦头烂额的奠边府守军。其中许多已被人民军击毙或被俘。
