    The basic-level election work in the entire Southwest region has been victoriously concluded. As of April 20th, 26,502 basic-level units in the region, covering a population of over 90 million, had completed the election work. The population in the areas that have completed the basic-level elections accounts for 99.2% of the total population in the region eligible for universal suffrage.
    The broad masses of voters in the Southwest region seriously and earnestly exercised their rights as citizens. The voter turnout generally reached over 90%. The people in the old revolutionary base areas along the borders of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces demonstrated great political enthusiasm in the universal suffrage movement. Li Nengcai, a 69-year-old Red Army veteran from Maoyu Township, Tongjiang County, personally went to the voter registration station on a snowy night, leaning on a cane to collect his ballot and carefully elected his representative. Through universal suffrage, a large number of outstanding basic-level people's representatives were elected throughout the region. Sichuan Province alone elected over 500,000 basic-level people's representatives. Before the election, the voters carefully discussed and evaluated the candidate representatives. In many areas of Sichuan Province, voters organized visiting teams to visit the candidates to clarify their situations; some traveled dozens of miles to learn about the candidate representatives. Among the people's representatives, there are many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Among the 3,382 township and town people's representatives elected in Pengshui County, Sichuan Province, 1,033 were Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Ethnic minority representatives also accounted for a considerable proportion of the people's representatives. In Shimenshan County, Xikang Province, in the eleven mixed ethnic townships and one autonomous township, the Tibetan and Yi populations accounted for only 10.4% of the county's population, but the elected representatives accounted for 15.4% of the total number of people's representatives in the county.
    Currently, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Chongqing and other provinces and cities have generally held the first session of basic-level people's congresses; some areas that completed universal suffrage earlier have already held seven or eight sessions. The basic-level people's congresses in various places generally first solicit opinions and proposals from the voters, then combine them with the central work of each period, and after full discussion, make resolutions to be transmitted and implemented, thus powerfully promoting various tasks.

    The 470,000 ethnic minorities scattered throughout the East China region, together with the local voters, actively exercised their democratic rights in the basic-level elections. Many outstanding figures from ethnic minorities were elected as people's representatives and participated in the work of people's governments at all levels. In Shanghai, 63 ethnic minorities were elected as district people's representatives. In Hangzhou, four people's representatives were elected from among the 1,216 scattered ethnic minority voters.
    In the universal suffrage, voters of all ethnic groups actively and conscientiously participated in the election together with the local voters. The Hui voters in the Niushouxiang election district of Nanjing made use of the "prayers" in the mosque to deeply discuss the candidate representatives. During the election, Hui women who had never attended meetings in the past also wore "headscarves" and new clothes to vote.
    Through the election, the unity and cooperation between the people of all ethnic groups were further enhanced, and the political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups was raised. In the Dajia Township, a Hui settlement area in Licheng County, Shandong Province, many Hui people changed their habits of valuing commerce over agriculture and not cultivating the land they owned during the universal suffrage and the publicity and education of the general line, and organized 49 agricultural mutual aid groups. During the basic-level elections in Jining City, Shandong Province, a Hui autonomous region was established. The Hui people said: In the past, they regarded the Han people as outsiders, but now they are like brothers, and they should strengthen unity and do a good job in production in the future. Many Han people went to the autonomous region to help the workers in the Hui foundry study and improve production techniques. Hui residents also taught Han people how to make leather, sew leather, and make candles. A new atmosphere of mutual assistance and love is emerging in the autonomous region. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The universal suffrage work of 6,494 basic-level political power units in Shanxi Province has been completed, and people's congresses have been held in all basic-level units, and basic-level people's governments have been elected.
    Many outstanding Communist Party members, workers, and backbones and activists in the mutual aid and cooperation movement were elected as people's representatives and cadres in basic-level political power. Among the 964 people's representatives elected in the basic-level units of Yangquan City, a mining area, worker representatives accounted for 42.3% of the total. Among the 19,379 representatives elected in 807 townships in 17 counties including Xiangyuan, 8,729 were Communist Party members. Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, winners of the 1952 "Patriotic High-Yielding Golden Star Medal," Qu Yaoli, a national cotton-planting model, Chen San, a model worker in the Yangquan Coal Mine industry, Hu Wenxiu, the mother of martyr Liu Hulan, Shen Jilan, a representative who attended the 1953 World Women's Congress, Wei Yuansheng, a labor hero during the Anti-Japanese War, and Xu Shunhai, a militia hero who killed the enemy, all received the highest number of votes.
    After the universal suffrage, the connection between the basic-level people's government and the broad masses of the people became closer. Before the convening of the basic-level people's congresses in various parts of the province, a total of more than 30,000 proposals related to production and other issues and opinions on the work of the government were received. Most of these suggestions were carefully discussed and resolutions were made, which were implemented by the people's representatives taking the lead. Basic-level cadres and people's representatives in various places have established many systems for close contact with the masses. The people's representatives of Wangzhai Township, Qinshui County, formulated a simple and easy-to-implement work system, and adopted the "four diligence" method of contacting the masses, namely, "diligent in mouth" (explaining policies and conveying resolutions to the people), "diligent in ears" (listening to the voices and reflections of the masses), "diligent in legs" (going deep into the masses to understand problems), and "diligent in hands" (taking the lead in various tasks).
    Through the universal suffrage, the extremely backward villages in the province also changed their original backward appearance. In Daobei Township, Pingyao County, the voters in the universal suffrage removed eight bad elements who had infiltrated into the government agencies and agricultural production cooperatives as cadres, and elected 33 people's representatives who were upright, fair in their work, contacted the masses, and actively led the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In addition to expanding the original agricultural production cooperative, the township also established another agricultural production cooperative, and the number of mutual aid groups increased to 57, and the number of organized households increased from 40% to 65%. The masses actively paid off the arrears of public grain over the years, and subscribed to 12 million yuan of national economic construction bonds. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南全区基层选举工作胜利结束
    华东四十七万少数民族在普选中行使了民主权利
    西南全区的基层选举工作已胜利结束。到四月二十日止，全区已有二万六千五百零二个基层单位，约九千多万人口的地区完成了选举工作。完成基层选举地区的人口占全区普选地区的人口百分之九十九点二。
    西南区的广大选民认真严肃地行使了自己的公民权利。投票的选民一般达到百分之九十以上。川陕边革命老根据地的人民在普选运动中，表现出极大的政治热情。通江县毛浴乡六十九岁的老红军干部李能才，在雪夜里扶着拐杖亲自到选民登记站去领取选票，认真地选举了自己的代表。经过普选，全区选出了大批优秀的基层人民代表。仅四川省选出的基层人民代表便有五十多万名。选民们在进行选举以前，对代表候选人都进行了认真的讨论和鉴别。四川省有很多地区的选民为弄清楚代表候选人的情况，自动组织了访问队去访问候选人；有的跑到几十里路以外的地方去了解代表候选人的情况。在人民代表中，有许多共产党员和青年团员。四川省彭水县选出的三千三百八十二名乡、镇人民代表中，有共产党员和青年团员一千零三十三人。在人民代表中，少数民族的代表也占了相当的比例。西康省石棉县十一个民族杂居乡和一个自治乡，藏族彝族人口只占全县人口百分之十点四，选出的代表却占了全县人民代表总数的百分之十五点四。
    现在，四川、云南、贵州、西康、重庆等省、市已普遍开过第一次基层人民代表大会；完成普选较早的地区，有的已开过七八次。各地的基层人民代表大会一般都先征求选民意见和提案，再结合各个时期的中心工作，经过充分讨论，作出决议向下传达执行，这样就有力地推动了各项工作。

    散居在华东区各地的四十七万少数民族，在基层选举中和当地选民一起积极地行使了自己的民主权利。有许多少数民族的优秀人物被选为人民代表，参加了各级人民政府的工作。上海市有六十三位少数民族被选为区人民代表。杭州市在散居的一千二百十六个少数民族选民中，选出了四位人民代表。
    在普选中，各族选民都积极认真地和当地选民一起参加选举。南京市牛首巷选区的回族选民，利用清真寺的“礼拜”深入地讨论了代表候选人。选举时，过去从未参加过会议的回族妇女，也都戴上“盖头”，穿着新衣去投票。
    经过选举，进一步增进了各族人民之间的团结和合作，提高了各族人民的政治觉悟。山东省历城县回族聚居区党家乡，在普选和总路线的宣传教育中，改变了许多回民重商轻农、有地不耕的习惯，组织了四十九个农业互助组。山东省济宁市基层选举中，成立了一个回族自治区。回民们说：过去看汉民是外人，现在是亲兄弟，今后应更好地加强团结，搞好生产。许多汉民到自治区帮助回民翻砂厂的工人研究提高生产技术。回族居民也教给汉民制皮、缝皮和制烛等方法。自治区内呈现着一片互助友爱的新气象。（新华社）
    山西全省六千四百九十四个基层政权单位的普选工作已全部结束，各基层单位都召开了人民代表大会并选出基层人民政府。
    许多优秀的共产党员和工人、互助合作运动的骨干和积极分子当选为人民代表和基层政权中的干部。工矿区阳泉市基层单位选出的九百六十四个人民代表中，工人代表便占总数的百分之四十二点三。襄垣等十七个县八百零七个乡选出的一万九千三百七十九个代表中，有共产党员八千七百二十九人。一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安，全国植棉模范曲耀离，阳泉煤矿工业劳动模范陈三，刘胡兰烈士的母亲胡文秀，出席一九五三年世界妇女大会的代表申纪兰，抗日战争时期的劳动英雄魏元胜和民兵杀敌英雄徐顺孩，都得到了最高的选票。
    普选后的基层人民政府和广大人民群众的联系更加密切了。全省各地基层人民代表大会召开前，收到有关生产等问题的建议和对政府工作的意见的提案共约三万多件，这些建议大都经过认真讨论作出决议，由人民代表带头贯彻执行。各地基层干部和人民代表都建立了许多密切联系群众的制度，沁水县王寨乡人民代表订出简便易行的工作制度，采用了“四勤”的联系群众方法，即“口勤”（向人民交代政策、传达决议），“耳勤”（听取群众呼声和反映），“腿勤”（多深入群众，了解问题），“手勤”（在各项工作中带头）。
    经过普选，省内极少数的落后乡也改变了原来的落后面貌。平遥县道备乡的选民在普选中剔除了混入政权机关和农业生产合作社当干部的八个坏分子，选出了为人正派、办事公道、联系群众并积极领导互助合作运动的三十三个人民代表。这个乡除扩大了原有的一个农业生产合作社以外，又建立了一个农业生产合作社，互助组增加到五十七个，组织起来的农户由百分之四十增加到百分之六十五。群众积极交清了历年尾欠的公粮，并认购了一千二百多万元国家经济建设公债。（新华社）
