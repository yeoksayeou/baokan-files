Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th dispatch from TASS: "Pravda" published an article by Prischevsky, commenting on the growing resistance to the U.S. plot to expand the Indochina War.

Prischevsky wrote: Throughout the world, especially in France, the movement advocating a peaceful settlement in Indochina is growing. This fact infuriates the American aggressive bloc. In order to prevent a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, the United States is making diplomatic preparations to take command of the Indochina War into its own hands, leaving France only the right to send more French troops to the Indochina front.

Dulles said in his speeches on March 29 and April 5 that the entire Southeast Asian region is "extremely important" to the United States. He also stated that the United States wants to prevent any changes in the existing social order in any Southeast Asian country, regardless of how these changes occur, unless the new order is in line with the wishes of the United States.

Prischevsky said: It is difficult to say whether Dulles's speech is dominated by megalomania or class blindness. Dulles wants to permanently preserve the existing colonial system based on the cruel exploitation and oppression of millions of people. He wants to prohibit the people of colonies and dependent countries from fighting for freedom and national independence. However, this is not up to Dulles. The oppressed people have fought and will continue to fight for the establishment of a social and political system that conforms to their fundamental and vital interests. No threat from the imperialists can stop this just national liberation struggle.

Prischevsky talked about the United States' plot to drag its most "loyal" allies—Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the Philippines—into the gamble of expanding the Indochina War, adding them to France, which is already at war. He pointed out: Even among this small group of countries, this policy of expanding the war in Asia has met with fierce opposition.

The French "Volunteers' Newspaper" wrote on April 7: In France, "whether in parliament, in the government, or among the public, the majority do not agree to the internationalization of the war, because this will increase the danger of war, and the taxes paid by the French people with blood and money cannot be reduced."

In London, Dulles's speech on "united action" also received a bad reaction from the start. London believes that the "united action" mentioned in Dulles's March 29 speech is a step to drag Britain into military action in Indochina. The "New York Times" correspondent in London wrote on the 8th: "The British government doubts the value of taking any hasty action in Indochina and Southeast Asia that might undermine the success of the Geneva Conference under the current circumstances."

Prischevsky pointed out: Of course, one should not overestimate the significance of London and Paris's current unwillingness to support Dulles's plan to expand the war. The French government's "decision to delay replying to the American proposal" and the British government's doubts about the value of taking "hasty action" "under the current circumstances" may also be tactical maneuvers by the two governments.

Prischevsky concluded: But even so, the worldwide protests against the U.S. plan to expand the war in Asia have frustrated the U.S. aggressive policy. This is still a fact.
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th dispatch: The Czechoslovak "People's Defense Daily" commented on the 10th on the U.S. ruling clique's slander against China for "interfering" in the Indochina War and plotting a joint declaration. The commentary said: The purpose of the United States blaming the People's Republic of China for the failure of the colonial troops in Indochina is nothing more than to prevent a peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, thereby creating an intractable situation at the Geneva Conference.

"People's Defense Daily" said: The purpose of the United States' "arrogant means" of slandering China with its own crimes is to gradually turn the Indochina War into an international war like what happened in Korea.

"People's Defense Daily" condemned the many destructive actions taken by the U.S. ruling clique against the Geneva Conference. The newspaper said: "For millions of ordinary people, the Geneva Conference is a road to reaching agreements on the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, and a road to further easing international tensions; it is another vivid proof that it is not only necessary but also possible to resolve differences through conferences instead of bloodshed."
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th dispatch: The Albanian "People's Voice" wrote on the 10th that peace-loving people all hope that the upcoming Geneva Conference can lay the foundation for resolving outstanding Asian issues. However, on the eve of the conference, those who oppose international cooperation, led by the aggressive forces in Washington, are stepping up their efforts to complicate the situation. Recent statements and interviews with reporters by some American political leaders, such as Eisenhower and Dulles, clearly show that they are trying to evade the obligations they undertook in Berlin, and that they are using various conspiracies in dangerous adventurous activities to achieve their goals. The U.S. aggressive bloc, which advocates pursuing a "strength" policy, is trying its best to intensify the international tense atmosphere in order to make the Geneva Conference fail. However, the conspiracy of the U.S. aggressive bloc has been condemned by public opinion, which firmly demands an end to blackmail and provocation, and the settlement of disputes through negotiation and mutual understanding. The Asian people and peace-loving people all over the world are looking forward to the convening of the Geneva Conference with hope.
Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: The Australian "Guardian" pointed out in its commentary on Dulles's speech on the Indochina War on April 1: "The United States is trying to drag other countries—including Australia—into the Indochina War."

The "Guardian" called on the Australian people to strike a heavy blow against the U.S. war plan.

On the same day, the "Guardian" published an editorial entitled "Hold High the Banner of International Peace." The editorial pointed out, when talking about Dulles's so-called new policy of "massive retaliation": This sentence "scared Dulles's 'allies' in Britain, Canada, France, and elsewhere, because these people would suffer the most if such a war occurred." The editorial also pointed out that everyone can clearly see that the American war-mongers do not want a peaceful solution to international problems.

### 美国扩大印度支那战争的计划遭到各国人民日益增强的反抗

    美国扩大印度支那战争的计划遭到各国人民日益增强的反抗
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”刊载了普利歇夫斯基的一篇文章，评述美国竭力扩大印度支那战争的阴谋遭到日益增长的反抗。
    普利歇夫斯基写道：在全世界，特别是在法国，主张在印度支那和平解决的运动日益发展。这个事实激怒了美国侵略集团。美国为了阻止印度支那问题的和平解决，正在外交上进行准备，以便把印度支那战争的指挥权拿到自己手里，只给法国留下增派法国军队到印度支那前线去的权利。
    杜勒斯在三月二十九日和四月五日的演说中曾说，整个东南亚地区对美国来说是“极为重要的”。他并且表示，美国要阻止东南亚任何国家现有的社会秩序的变化，不管这种变化是如何发生的，除非新的秩序合乎美国的心意。
    普利歇夫斯基说：很难说，在杜勒斯的演说中支配着的东西是夸大狂还是阶级盲目性。杜勒斯想要永久保存建立在对千百万人进行残酷剥削和压迫的基础上的现存的殖民制度。他想要禁止殖民地和附属国人民为争取自由和民族独立而斗争。但是，这不是取决于杜勒斯的。被压迫的人民过去和将来都要为建立一个符合于他们根本的切身利益的社会和政治制度而斗争。帝国主义者的任何威胁都是无法阻止这一正义的民族解放斗争的。
    普利歇夫斯基谈到美国在策划把它的最“忠实”的盟国——英国，澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国和菲律宾拖入扩大印度支那战争的赌博，加到已经在作战的法国中去。他指出：即使在这一小撮国家之中，这种在亚洲扩大战争的政策都遭到了激烈的反对。
    法国“义勇军报”四月七日写道：在法国“不论在议会中、政府中或公众中，大多数人都不同意战争国际化，因为这将增加战争的危险，使法国人民用血和钱来交纳的赋税不能得到减少。”
    在伦敦，杜勒斯关于“联合行动”的演说也是一开始就得到了不好的反应。伦敦认为杜勒斯三月二十九日演说中所说的“联合行动”，就是要把英国拖入印度支那的军事行动的一个步骤。“纽约时报”驻伦敦记者在八日写道：“英国政府怀疑，在目前情况下在印度支那和东南亚采取任何可能损害日内瓦会议的成功的轻率行动有什么价值。”
    普利歇夫斯基指出：当然，对于伦敦和巴黎目前不愿意支持杜勒斯扩大战争的计划的表示，不应当过高地估计它的意义。法国政府“决定延迟答复美国的建议”，英国政府怀疑在“目前的情况下”采取“轻率行动”的价值，这种保留态度也可能是两国政府的策略上的手腕。
    普利歇夫斯基最后说：但是，即使如此，全世界对美国扩大亚洲战争计划的抗议，已使美国的侵略政策失了效。这毕竟是事实。
      【新华社布拉格十三日电】捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”十日评论美国统治集团诬蔑中国“干涉”印度支那战争并策划一个联合宣言。评论说：美国把殖民军队在印度支那的失败诿过于中华人民共和国，这种阴谋的目的，无非是使印度支那问题的和平解决不能实现，从而在日内瓦会议上造成一种难以解决的局面。
      “人民防线报”说：美国这种把自己犯的罪来诬蔑中国的“蛮横手段”，其目的是要把印度支那战争逐渐变为如同在朝鲜所发生的那种国际战争。
      “人民防线报”对于美国统治集团对日内瓦会议所采取的许多破坏行动加以斥责。报纸说：“对于千百万老百姓来说，日内瓦会议是走向对朝鲜问题和印度支那问题取得协议的道路，是走向国际紧张形势进一步缓和的道路；它是又一个生动的证据，证明不用流血而用会议方式来解决分歧，不仅是必要的而且也是可能的。”
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”十日写道，爱好和平的人们都希望即将举行的日内瓦会议能为解决悬而未决的亚洲问题打下基础。但是，就在会议前夕，以华盛顿的侵略势力为首的反对国际合作的人，正在加紧设法使局势更加复杂。近来，像艾森豪威尔，杜勒斯等这样一些美国政治领袖发表的声明和对记者的谈话都清楚说明，他们企图规避在柏林所承担的义务，并且他们在危险的冒险活动中正在利用种种阴谋来达到他们的目标。主张奉行“实力”政策的美国侵略集团正在竭力加剧国际紧张气氛，来使日内瓦会议失败。然而，美国侵略集团的阴谋受到了舆论的谴责，舆论坚决要求停止讹诈和挑衅，并用谈判和互相谅解的方式来解决争端。亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都满怀希望地期待着日内瓦会议的召开。
    【新华社十二日讯】澳大利亚“卫报”四月一日在评论杜勒斯关于印度支那战争的演说时指出：“美国企图把其他国家——包括澳大利亚在内——卷入印度支那战争。”
    “卫报”号召澳大利亚人民沉重地打击美国的战争计划。
    同日，“卫报”以“高举国际和平的旗帜”为题发表社论。社论在谈到杜勒斯所谓的“大规模报复”的新政策时指出：这句话“吓倒了杜勒斯的英国、加拿大、法国和其他地方的‘盟友’，因为如果发生这样的战争，这些人会受害最深。”社论并且指出，大家都清楚地看到，美国战争贩子是不希望和平解决国际问题的。
