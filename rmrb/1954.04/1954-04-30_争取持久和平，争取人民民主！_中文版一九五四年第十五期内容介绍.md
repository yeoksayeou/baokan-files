    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" 1954, No. 15, has been published.

    This issue's editorial, entitled "The Road to Consolidating Peace and Security in Europe," points out that the revival of German militarism is a serious threat to the people of all European countries, including the German people. The people of all European countries clearly remember the lessons of history. They have not forgotten, nor will they ever forget, that the First and Second World Wars broke out after Europe was divided into opposing military camps. The people of Western European countries resolutely demand that their governments restore an independent and autonomous policy that conforms to their national interests and abandon the plan to establish a "European Army." It is natural and easy to understand that millions of people are increasingly supporting the Soviet Union's proposals for ensuring peace and security in Europe. Because the draft "All-European Treaty on Ensuring Collective Security in Europe" provides guarantees for the peace and security of all European countries. Establishing such a system would eliminate the opportunity for the revival of German militarism. The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to jointly study the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the relevant countries. Because the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as well as the possible participation of other European countries, would give this treaty a defensive nature. The editorial concludes by saying that the Soviet Union's new proposals have won the unanimous support of the masses and the active support of democratic groups. The forces of peace and progress in Europe clearly understand that the true guarantee of European security is not the establishment of opposing military blocs and military camps, nor the revival of German militarism, but the common efforts of all European countries, including the efforts of the major powers that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining the post-war order in Europe.

    This issue publishes a speech by Mikoyan, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Important articles published in this issue include: "The Current Situation and the Struggle for the Establishment of a New Germany" by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; "Developing Agriculture is the Most Important Condition for Improving the Welfare of the Working People of Poland" by Nowak, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; and "Further Developing Czechoslovakia's Economy and Improving the Living Standards of the Working People" by Viliam Široký, Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

    Nowak's article points out that Poland's achievements in socialist industrialization have made it possible for us to concentrate the Party's main forces on developing agriculture and eliminating the extreme imbalance in the development of industry and agriculture. The current task is to use the favorable conditions created by the rapid development of socialist industrialization and overcome all shortcomings and weaknesses in agricultural leadership to ensure the continuous development of agricultural production and animal husbandry. Grain production was, and still is, the central issue in developing agricultural production. In order to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Party and the government have decided to continue to expand the network of machine tractor stations. Our task is to take better care of existing agricultural producers' cooperatives and establish new agricultural producers' cooperatives. We must carry out more extensive political and organizational work and develop the cooperative movement among the working peasants. Nowak said: Our Party has creatively applied Lenin's theory on the worker-peasant alliance in its policies, and it is redoubling its efforts to rapidly increase agricultural production—an important factor in rapidly improving the living standards of the working people—and strengthening the power of the people's state.

    Široký's article is an abstract of the report he made at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia at the end of March. Široký pointed out: The price reductions implemented in Czechoslovakia on April 1 prove that our entire national economy has been further developed, and it is also a clear proof of the achievements we have made in socialist construction. However, from the perspective of continuously improving the living standards of the working people of our country, the issue of agricultural production at the current stage of socialist construction is one of the major issues in our national economy. Therefore, we must draw up a short-term plan of two or three years, stipulating some measures to continuously increase agricultural production. The current task of our Party is to better and more systematically organize the creative labor of the working people of our country, so as to ensure the completion of the major tasks discussed at this plenary session of the Party Central Committee.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十五期已经出版。
    本期在题为“巩固欧洲和平与安全的道路”的社论中指出：复活德国军国主义是对欧洲各国人民（包括德国人民在内）的严重威胁。欧洲各国人民都很清楚地记得历史的教训，他们没有忘记、也决不会忘记第一次和第二次世界大战都是在欧洲分成了对立的军事营垒以后才爆发的。西欧各国人民坚决要求本国政府恢复符合本国民族利益的独立自主的政策，摒弃建立“欧洲军”的计划。千百万人民越来越支持苏联关于保障欧洲和平与安全的建议，这是很自然而且容易理解的。因为“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，为所有欧洲国家的和平和安全提供了保证。建立这样一个制度，就可以杜绝德国军国主义复活的机会。苏联政府已经表示准备和有关国家共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题。因为苏联参加北大西洋公约以及其他欧洲国家有可能参加这一公约，就会使这一公约具有防御的性质。社论最后说：苏联的新建议获得了人民群众的一致拥护和民主团体的积极支持。欧洲的和平进步力量很清楚地懂得，欧洲安全的真正保障不是建立彼此对立的军事集团和军事营垒，也不是复活德国军国主义，而是要靠所有欧洲国家的共同努力，包括对维持战后欧洲的秩序负有主要责任的各大国的努力。
    本期刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员米高扬在德国统一社会党第四次代表大会上的讲话。本期刊载的重要文章有：德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希的“目前形势和为建立新德国而斗争”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员诺瓦克的“发展农业是增进波兰劳动人民福利的最重要的条件”，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理、捷共中央政治局书记处书记西罗基的“进一步发展捷克斯洛伐克的经济，提高劳动人民的生活水平”。
    诺瓦克的文章指出：波兰在社会主义工业化方面的成就，使我们有可能集中党的主要力量来发展农业和消除工农业发展的极不平衡的现象。目前的任务是运用社会主义工业化的迅速发展所创造的有利条件和克服农业领导方面的一切缺点和弱点，来保证农业生产和饲畜业的不断发展。谷物生产过去是、现在仍然是发展农业生产的中心问题。为了对农业进行社会主义改造，党和政府决定继续扩大机器拖拉机站网。我们的任务是更好地关怀现有的农业生产合作社，成立新的农业生产合作社。我们必须更加广泛地进行政治和组织工作，在劳动农民中开展合作运动。诺瓦克说：我们党在自己的政策中创造性地运用了列宁关于工农联盟的学说，它正在加倍努力地为尽速提高农业生产——这是迅速提高劳动人民生活水平的重要因素——和加强人民国家的力量而斗争。
    西罗基的文章是他三月底在捷共中央全体会议上所作的报告的摘要。西罗基指出：四月一日捷克斯洛伐克实行的减低物价，证明我们整个国民经济已有进一步的发展，同时也是我们在社会主义建设中取得成就的明证。但是，从不断提高我国劳动人民生活水平这一任务方面来看，社会主义建设现阶段的农业生产问题是我国国民经济上的重大问题之一。因此，我们必须订出一个两三年的短期计划，规定出不断增加农业生产的一些措施。我们党的当前任务就是更好地、更有计划地组织我国劳动人民的创造性劳动，从而保证完成这次党中央全体会议所讨论的重大任务。　（新华社）
