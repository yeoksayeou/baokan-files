    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Newspaper and Magazine Distribution
    -- Reader Letters Summary
    According to reader letters, some postal institutions are currently very irresponsible in the distribution of newspapers and magazines, and there are frequent instances of under-delivery or over-delivery of newspapers and magazines. Zhang Huading of Shuanghe Elementary School in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, wrote: "My school subscribes to five kinds of newspapers at the Shuanghe Postal Agency, and there are shortages every month. Among them, the 'Hubei Daily' is the most frequently missing, and the 'Xiangyang Daily' and 'China Young Pioneers News' have never been received in full for a single month. My school subscribes to two copies each of 'Serial Pictorial' and 'Children's Era', but the agency always delivers one copy; we only subscribed to one copy each of 'Prospect' and 'Good Kids', but twice they sent two copies. We have made suggestions to the post office countless times, but this phenomenon continues to occur." Shi Hongjiang of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "Last December, I subscribed to a copy of 'New Observer' magazine at the Xinshijie Post Office in Beijing, and I have not received a single issue to this day. I have personally gone to the bureau, called, and written more than ten times to inquire, but there has been no result." Liu Dancheng of Benxi Second Middle School wrote: "My school's trade union and other organizations subscribed to 'China Youth', 'Mathematical Communications', and 'China Young Pioneers News', and only received one issue in the first quarter. We have repeatedly asked the post office to reissue them, but they always give perfunctory answers. What is especially intolerable is that the post office often sends my school extra copies of other periodicals, and when we return them to the post office, they retort: Who else besides you subscribes? Just accept them. This irresponsible attitude towards distribution work should be severely criticized."
    Another instance of irresponsibility on the part of some post offices is that they arbitrarily refuse readers to subscribe to periodicals, preventing readers from subscribing to the publications they need. Sha Baoquan and others of the Fourth Detachment of the Bo Gang Diversion River Project Headquarters of the Huai River Harnessing Committee wrote: "We have repeatedly gone to the Zhuangba Town Post and Telecommunications Bureau to subscribe to periodicals such as 'Current Affairs Handbook' and 'China Youth', but the bureau has consistently refused to let us subscribe. Finally, we showed them a copy of the national directory of major magazines issued by the post and telecommunications bureau that we brought from elsewhere, and they said that they had not received this directory and still would not let us subscribe." Hu Lianke of the Anshan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce wrote: "I went to the Anshan Post Office on March 2nd to subscribe to 'Literary Studies', and the post office said that the deadline was March 1st and they would not subscribe today. On March 4th, I saw an advertisement in the People's Daily on March 3rd, saying that 'Literary Studies' would be launched in April and subscriptions were now open. The next day, I hurried to subscribe. But the post office said: Our superiors have notified us not to subscribe, and what is published in the newspaper does not count." Reader Zhong You wrote: "After I saw the publication of 'Fine Arts' in the newspaper, I went to the Xuzhou Post and Telecommunications Bureau to subscribe, but they said that they had not received a notice from their superiors and could not subscribe. I went several times in a row, and they always said that they had not received a notice, so I did not subscribe to the first quarter of 'Fine Arts' this year."
    The existence of the above situation affects the learning of some readers. It is recommended that the General Post Office urge local post offices to conscientiously improve their distribution work.

### 认真做好报刊发行工作——读者来信综述

    认真做好报刊发行工作
    ——读者来信综述
    据读者来信反映：目前某些邮政机构对报刊发行工作很不负责，经常发生少送或多送报刊的现象。湖北枣阳县双河小学张化定来信说：“我校在双河邮政代办所所订的五种报纸，月月有缺。其中以‘湖北日报’少得最多，‘襄阳报’和‘中国少年报’从来没有一个月收齐。我校订‘连环画报’和‘儿童时代’各两份，代办所老是送来一份；
  ‘展望’和‘好孩子’只订了一份，但有二次送了两份。我们向邮局提了不知多少次意见，但是，这种现象还是不断发生。”解放军某部史鸿江来信说：“去年十二月我在北京新市街邮局订了一份‘新观察’杂志，到现在还没收到过一期，我曾亲去该局、打电话及写信查询十余次，但一直没有结果。”本溪市第二中学刘丹诚来信说：“我校工会等所订的
  ‘中国青年’、‘数学通讯’及‘中国少年报’第一季度都只收到了一期，我们几次要求邮局补发，他们总是敷衍了事。尤其令人不能容忍的是，邮局经常多送给我校其他的期刊，我们退还邮局时，他们反说：除了你们还有谁订？你们收下算了。这种对发行工作不负责任的态度，应该受到严厉批评。”
    某些邮局不负责任的另一种事实，就是随便拒绝读者订阅期刊，使读者订不到他们需要的刊物。治淮委员会泊岗引河工程指挥部第四支队沙宝权等来信说：“我们曾多次到庄坝镇邮电局订阅‘时事手册’、‘中国青年’等期刊，但该局始终不给订。最后我们将别处带来的一份邮电局发行的全国主要杂志目录表给他们看，他们说没有接到过这个目录，仍不让订。”鞍山市工商局胡连科来信说：“我在三月二日到鞍山邮局订阅‘文艺学习’，邮局说三月一日到期，今天不订了。三月四日我看到三月三日人民日报上的广告，说是‘文艺学习’四月创刊，现已开始订阅。第二天我就急忙去订。但邮局说：我们上级有通知不订，报上登的不管。”读者锺友来信说：“我在报上看到‘美术’出版后，就去徐州市邮电局订阅，但他们说还没有接到上级通知，不能订。我一连去了好几次，他们一直说没有接到通知，因此，我就没有订上今年第一季度的‘美术’。”
    上述情况的存在，影响了一部分读者的学习，建议邮政总局督促各地邮局认真改进发行工作。
