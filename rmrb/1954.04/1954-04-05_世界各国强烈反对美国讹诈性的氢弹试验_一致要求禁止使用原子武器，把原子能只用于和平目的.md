Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd:

America's hydrogen bomb tests, a bluff intended to bolster its bankrupt "policy of strength," have aroused extremely strong opposition and condemnation from countries around the world.

British public opinion is voicing increasingly strong accusations against America's conspiracy to continue atomic blackmail. According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on April 1st, the British Peace Committee issued an appeal calling on the British people to take action to ensure that Parliament fully recognizes the British people's determination to stop the manufacture of atomic weapons. The Tobacco Workers' Union of Britain, with 26,000 members, has written to Prime Minister Churchill, demanding that the United States cease detonating hydrogen bombs. Heavy machinery workers in the Firth Browns area of Sheffield telegraphed Churchill, demanding that the major powers hold a meeting to ban atomic weapons. The Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with 20,000 members, the Association of Scientific Workers for Peace, the National Executive of the Teachers for Peace Committee, and other organizations have passed resolutions similar to the above demands. Professor Alexander Haddow, Director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute of the Royal Cancer Hospital of Britain, said on March 30th: The intellectual community has a responsibility to influence politicians to find ways to implement international control over atomic energy and atomic weapons, and to implement international cooperation. Dr. Martin, a famous Australian scientist, said: The holding of a meeting by major powers to safeguard the interests of mankind itself cannot be delayed any longer.

On March 31st, the Austrian Peace Council held an anti-hydrogen bomb conference in Vienna. The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding the prohibition of the use and testing of all atomic weapons.

The "World Pacifist Conference" held in Tokyo on April 1st passed a resolution deciding to draft an appeal to the United Nations against the use of atomic weapons and demanding that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes.

America's attempt to continue detonating hydrogen bombs has also been widely opposed by political circles in various countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement in the People's House on the 2nd, demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb tests. A spokesman for the Ceylon government also gave a speech to reporters on the 1st, demanding a halt to American hydrogen bomb tests.

Approximately 100 British Labour Party members of Parliament signed a motion on the evening of the 30th, demanding that the British government take steps to prevent further hydrogen bomb detonations. Bevan, one of the Labour Party leaders, emphasized: "The United States must clearly recognize that the Pacific Ocean is not American territory." The motion proposed by the Labour MPs also advocated that the five major powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and China make recommendations on future atomic controls and disarmament. Under the pressure of Labour Party members of Parliament, British Prime Minister Churchill has announced that the House of Commons will hold a debate on the issue of the recent American atomic weapons tests on April 5th. On April 1st, British Labour MP Warbey asked Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons to guarantee "for the security of Britain" that the United States would not store any hydrogen bombs at their air bases here (referring to Britain). He said that otherwise, "our country may be in mortal danger because of these American bases."

The Japanese House of Representatives also unanimously passed a resolution on April 1st prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and decided to send the resolution to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, "requesting the United Nations to take appropriate and effective measures immediately."

United Press International reported on March 31st that a group of members of the Italian Parliament had submitted a formal inquiry to the Italian government, requesting the Minister of Foreign Affairs to state whether, in the current situation where the whole world is outraged by the recent American atomic weapons tests, he intends to "clearly express to the American government that such tests must be stopped."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 4th: The recent hydrogen bomb explosion tests conducted by the United States government have aroused strong indignation and condemnation from the Indian people.

Major General Sahib Singh Sokhey, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and a well-known scientist, demanded at a press conference in Delhi on the 2nd that the United States stop hydrogen bomb explosion tests. He called on the five major powers to take active measures to ban the production of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs.

Major General Sokhey called on the Indian government to raise this issue in the United Nations and to persist in its efforts until these weapons are effectively banned. Major General Sokhey expressed his support for Prime Minister Nehru's condemnation of these explosion tests and called on scientists to use science to serve humanity. He said, "Up to now, the United States still believes that it can treat Asians as guinea pigs for its experiments. The United States is once again endangering the people of Asian countries by testing new hydrogen bombs in the Pacific Ocean."

Gopalan, leader of the Communist parliamentary group in the Indian Parliament, and ten other members of Congress proposed a motion on March 31st, calling for attention to the disastrous consequences of the hydrogen bomb explosion tests conducted by the United States.

Dhirendra Nath Sen, Secretary-General of the West Bengal Peace Council, telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, requesting him to propose that the United Nations ban hydrogen bombs and destroy existing hydrogen bombs.

    世界各国强烈反对美国讹诈性的氢弹试验
    一致要求禁止使用原子武器，把原子能只用于和平目的
    【新华社三日讯】美国为了它已破产的“实力政策”虚张声势的氢弹试验，已激起世界各国极其强烈的反对和指责。
    英国公众对美国继续进行原子讹诈的阴谋发出了日益强烈的指责。据伦敦“工人日报”四月一日报道，英国和平委员会发出了呼吁，号召英国人民采取行动，以使议会充分认识到英国人民决心制止制造原子武器。拥有二万六千会员的英国烟草工人工会已写信给首相邱吉尔，要求他要美国不再爆炸氢弹。设菲尔德的菲士布朗斯地方的重机械工人打电报给邱吉尔，要求各大国举行会议，以禁止原子武器。拥有二万会员的混合机器工会设菲尔德地区委员会、科学界争取和平协会、教师争取和平委员会全国执行机构以及其他组织等通过了与上述要求相似的决议。英国皇家癌症医院切特·比蒂研究所所长亚历山大·海多教授三月三十日说：知识界有责任来影响政治家们，促使他们设法实行对原子能和原子武器的国际管制，并实行国际合作。澳大利亚著名科学家马丁博士说：由大国举行会议以维护人类本身的利益是不能再拖延的事了。
    奥地利和平理事会三月三十一日在维也纳举行反对氢弹大会，会议一致通过决议，要求禁止使用和试验各种原子武器。
    四月一日在东京举行的“世界和平主义者会议”通过了一项决议，决定草拟一项致联合国的呼吁书，反对使用原子武器，并要求只把原子能用于和平目的。
    美国继续爆炸氢弹的企图，也受到各国政界广泛的反对。印度总理尼赫鲁二日在人民院发表声明，要求停止氢弹试验。锡兰政府发言人也于一日向记者发表谈话，要求停止美国的氢弹试验。
    约一百名英国工党议员于三十日晚签署了一项动议，要求英国政府采取步骤制止再爆炸氢弹。工党领袖之一比万强调说：“美国必须认识清楚，太平洋并不是美国的领土”。工党议员提出的动议中并主张英国、美国、苏联、法国和中国五大国作出关于今后原子管制和裁减军备的建议。在工党议员纷纷要求下，英国首相邱吉尔已宣布下院将在四月五日就美国最近进行原子武器试验问题举行一次辩论。四月一日，英国工党议员华贝在下院要求邱吉尔首相“为了英国的安全”保证美国不在他们在这里（指英国）的空军基地储存任何氢弹。他说，否则，“我国就可能因这些美国的基地而处于致命的危险之下”。
    日本国会众议院也于四月一日一致通过了禁止使用原子武器的决议案，并决定把这个决议案送交联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，“要求联合国立即采取适当的和有效的措施”。
    合众社三月三十一日报道，意大利议会的一批议员已向意大利政府提出正式质问，要求外交部部长表示，在目前全世界都对美国最近的原子武器试验感到愤慨的情况下，是否打算“向美国政府明白表示必须停止这种试验”。
   【新华社新德里四日电】美国政府最近进行的氢弹爆炸试验引起了印度人民的强烈的愤慨和谴责。
    全印和平理事会副主席、著名的科学家萨希布·辛格·索克少将二日在德里记者招待会上要求美国停止氢弹爆炸试验。他要求五大国采取积极措施，禁止生产氢弹和原子弹。
    索克少将要求印度政府在联合国中提出这个问题，并坚持努力，直到这些武器受到有效的禁止为止。索克少将表示他支持尼赫鲁总理对这种爆炸试验的指责，并要求科学家用科学来为人类服务。他说，“到目前为止，美国还认为可以把亚洲人当作它做试验用的豚鼠。美国又一次在太平洋试验新的氢弹来危害亚洲各国人民了”。
    印度国会共产党议员团领袖高普兰和国会其他十个议员三月三十一日提出提案，要求注意美国进行的氢弹爆炸试验的恶果。
    西孟加拉和平理事会秘书长迪伦德拉·纳斯·塞恩致电尼赫鲁总理，要求建议联合国禁止氢弹并销毁现有的氢弹。
