    On March 17th, the Di Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative of Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, signed a contract with the state-owned Hebei Province No. 1 Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station for contract farming. This is the scene at the mechanization ceremony when the full text of the contract farming agreement was announced to all cooperative members.
    The tractor, pulling a five-bottom plow, began plowing the land of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative members happily said: "If we hadn't organized and made the land contiguous, we wouldn't be able to use this thing."
    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement across the country, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative and many brother cooperatives launched a patriotic production increase friendship competition. Geng Changsuo is reading letters from brother cooperatives in various places and preparing to answer the questions raised by the correspondents.
    The land plowed by the tractor, pulling a five-bottom plow, is straight, deep, and level. Members of the management committee of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative are checking the depth of plowing according to the standards stipulated in the contract farming agreement. Old cooperative member Li Shubin said: "Our cooperative has bought this big mule."
    Before the spring ploughing, the entire cooperative accumulated 6,162,000 catties of fertilizer, preparing to apply an average of 2,000 catties of fertilizer per mu of spring white land. Members of the third team are sending the accumulated fertilizer to the fields.
    Before the spring ploughing, the members of the eleven production teams made detailed divisions of labor. In order to increase the yield of oil crops, the women gathered together to select peanut seeds.
    In the past two years, the entire cooperative has dug more than fifty new wells, and under the guidance of water conservancy technicians, the old wells have been deepened and the pipes lowered to increase the water volume. In addition, the Provincial People's Government is also preparing to help them dig two machine wells in order to expand the irrigation area and ensure increased yields. In order to improve the soil and ensure a bumper harvest, the entire cooperative built a three-li-long windbreak forest belt. In the past two years, the entire cooperative has built more than 120 new houses. Now the cooperative is building a new house for cooperative member Li Haishen's family.

    五公村春天
    ——耿长锁农业生产合作社的春耕活动

    河北省饶阳县五公村狄长锁农业生产合作社和国营河北省第一农业机器拖拉机站在三月十七日签订了代耕协议。这是机耕典礼大会上向全体社员公布代耕协议书全文时的情形。
    拖拉机牵引着五铧犁在耿长锁农业生产合作社的土地上开始耕地了，社员们高兴地说：要不是组织起来，使土地连成一片，可就使不上这东西。
    随着全国各地互助合作运动的发展，耿长锁农业生产合作社和许多兄弟社展开了爱国增产友谊竞赛。耿长锁正在阅读各地兄弟社的来信，并准备答复来信人提出的问题。
    拖拉机牵引着五铧犁耕的地又直又深又平。耿长锁农业生产合作社管理委员会的委员们正在按照代耕协议书上规定的标准检查耕地的深度。老社员李树彬说：“咱社新买了这头大骡子。”
    春耕前全社积肥六百一十六万二千斤，平均每亩春白地准备施肥二千斤。第三队社员们正把积肥送到田里。
    在春耕前，十一个生产队的社员都作了详细分工。为了提高油料作物的产量，妇女们就聚在一起挑选花生种子。
    全社两年来打新井五十多眼，根据水利技工的指导，又把旧井深锥下管，增加水量。除此，省人民政府并准备帮助他们打机器井两眼，以便扩大浇地面积，保证产量提高。为了改变土壤和保证丰收，全社造了一条三里长的防风林带。两年来，全社盖新房一百二十余间。现在社里正给社员李海深家盖新房。
