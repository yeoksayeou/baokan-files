    Between Day and Night
    — A Record of the People Building Anshan
    By Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    The temporary lights set up at the airfield had already begun to flicker with their faint light, and the night had arrived relentlessly.
    The off-duty time had long passed. However, Sun Xiang, the drilling team leader, was still walking back and forth between the drill holes, busily working. He would ask about the drilling progress, or check the drill bit; at other times, he would bend down to help everyone push the water cart uphill. He never wanted to have a moment of idleness.
     "Master Sun, there's nothing more to do here; you should go back!"
    "Master Sun, it's too late; why haven't you gone back yet!"
    "Master Sun..."
    Every day after work, the drilling team members didn't know how many times they had to say these words. It had almost become a habit.
    Sun Xiang didn't leave until he saw that all the preparations for the night work were indeed in order, and then he was chased down the mountain by everyone.
    The starlight filled the sky, pouring brightly on the rugged mountain road. The jagged mountain peaks were illuminated as if they were transparent and shimmering. Because there was no wind, the treetops stretched quietly towards the sky, without moving at all. The smokestack of the distant power plant spewed smoke straight up like a fountain, without bending, and it dissipated in the air.
    He returned home after nine o'clock at night. His wife, Zhang Guizhi, was still doing needlework under the oil lamp; their child, Suozhu, was dozing on his mother's lap. He heard the door open, and immediately woke up alertly.
    Every night, Zhang Guizhi always patiently waited for him to come back for dinner, no matter how late it was or how long she had to wait. She always kept the food warm in the pot, adding firewood to keep it from getting cold, until he came back from the mountain. Suozhu was the same way; he always had to wait for his father to come home, lean on his father's chest, or have his father hold him for a while before he would go to sleep.
    "How's the drilling going?" As soon as Sun Xiang entered the door, Zhang Guizhi asked him this. She seemed to already know about his daytime work from those who had returned from the mountain earlier.
      These days, Sun Xiang and his drilling team members had run into a drill hole that was rare to see even once in ten years. This drill hole was in a soft gravel stratum, which consisted only of sand and pebbles as big as walnuts, eggs, or rice bowls. It was very difficult to carry out drilling work in such a place. As soon as the drill tool was lifted to take out the core and check the geological conditions of the rock stratum, the drill hole would immediately be blocked again. At that time, the advanced mud drilling method had not yet been introduced here, and there were no technicians in the team. No one could come up with a solution for such a drill hole.
    Of course, the work could not be stopped. In the end, everyone decided to first dig a drill hole to see what the situation was underground.
    Today was the first day of digging the hole.
    "It's only been dug a little more than one person deep. It collapses as we dig, and it doesn't look good," Sun Xiang said worriedly.
    He walked closer to the lamp. Zhang Guizhi took a close look at him. Not to mention the sand all over his body, even his eyebrows and hair seemed to have a layer of color. She said, "Look at what you've become."
    Zhang Guizhi quickly went to get him some water to wash his face. He reached for the mirror. He saw that only his eyes were moving on his face; he looked like a native.
    The water for washing his face was changed several times, each time like mud. Before he could finish washing, Suozhu had already climbed onto him.
    Around ten o'clock, the whole family went to sleep.
    However, they had just fallen asleep when a strong wind suddenly started blowing outside.
    The sorghum stalk curtain hanging on the window began to be whipped around with a rustling sound. The paper pasted on the window was also making a cracking sound as it was blown. The treetops howled with a sharp sound. Sun Xiang was awakened from his sleep by the sudden strong wind.
    Although he was drowsy and his eyes couldn't open due to days of fatigue, as soon as he woke up, his mind immediately went to the mountain. He thought: the wind on the mountain must be even stronger. The people who stayed on the mountain tonight are all apprentices and ordinary workers. With such a strong wind, wouldn't the drill tower, which is more than ten meters high, be blown down? Would there be any problems with the electricity used by the drilling machine...?
    He suddenly sat up, put on his clothes, and said to Zhang Guizhi, "Get up, get up, light the lamp."
    "What are you doing?"
    "Going up the mountain!"
    "What are you doing going there in the middle of the night?" Zhang Guizhi asked while getting up to light the lamp. However, the house was like a wind tunnel. The match was struck, but it was immediately blown out, and she couldn't light it.
    "Didn't you hear this wind?"
    "I heard there are a lot of wolves here."
    "I know there are a lot of wolves," Sun Xiang said. "What if there's an accident?"
    He pushed the door bolt to the side, and the two doors were blown open by the wind with a whoosh. He stepped over the threshold. Zhang Guizhi went to close the door, but the door was blocked by the strong wind. He turned around and pulled the two doors with both hands, and Zhang Guizhi pushed outward hard from inside the house. In this way, pushing from the inside and pulling from the outside, they finally managed to close the door.
    Outside Sun Xiang's house, there was also a wall more than one person high. He didn't have time to open the gate of the wall, and with a leap, he jumped out. As soon as he landed, a gust of wind knocked him to the ground.
    The wind was howling, and the whole earth seemed to be spinning. Sun Xiang walked against the wind, choking and unable to breathe. He took out the flashlight from his pocket, but it happened to be broken and didn't light up. Fortunately, he knew the road well. He walked while feeling his way, sometimes even having to retreat after taking two steps forward. When he was about halfway up the mountain, the strong wind seemed to be pressing down on him with force, trying to force him to retreat. He looked towards the airfield, which was pitch black, as if everything had been blown away. Only the distant power plant was flickering with sparse lights. He remembered that in the past, a drill hole was shut down for three months because the power went out and the drill tool was not lifted up, and he wished he could walk to the airfield in one step.
    He finally arrived at the 310 drill hole first. He walked into the wooden house where the drilling team members were resting, and saw people were resting. He asked, "Comrades, has the drill tool been lifted up?"
    "No. We thought the power would come back in a while."
    He quickly led everyone to lift the drill tool. In the strong wind and darkness, he and everyone else reinforced the steel ropes of the drill tower. After he had arranged the work at the 310 drill hole, he went to the other two drill holes.
    All the drill holes were the same, plunged into darkness because of the power outage. In the overwhelming wind, he practically felt his way along the winding mountain path to reach the team headquarters at the foot of the mountain. He called the power plant and learned that the power couldn't come through because the line was broken.
    The strong wind was blowing madly, and the sand on the mountain was blown like rain. Sun Xiang and several drilling team members bent over to check the lines. About 400 meters away from the drilling machine, they finally found that the electric wire, as thick as a finger, had somehow been broken due to the strong wind.
    Electrical workers came from the power plant. The drilling team members helped to hold the ladders together to connect the wires. The ladders were swaying and shaking, as if they were about to fall down. When people pulled up the wires, they couldn't stand on their own due to the strong wind. The wires were sometimes loose and sometimes tight, and sometimes even threw people several meters away. Although he was wearing a cotton-padded jacket, the sharp-mouthed wind from the top of the mountain kept piercing into his bones, as if he were wearing a single cloth shirt, and he was shivering. Sun Xiang took a break and felt his way back to the wooden house, got some straw ropes, gave one to each person, and tied them around their waists. Only then was this cotton-padded jacket, which was filled with wind, tied up like a pocket.
    They fixed the electric wire, and it was almost dawn.
    He went from one drill hole to another. A sleepy fatigue before dawn attacked him. He roused his spirits and walked against the roaring wind.
    As he walked, his path was blocked by something like a misty white air. He walked forward and saw that a section of the water pipe had burst. The water was spraying like raindrops, and the strong wind blew it far away. A large area was like it was raining.
    The rupture of the water pipe would seriously affect the water supply to the drilling machine. Sun Xiang disregarded everything and rushed to the side of the water pipe. His cotton-padded jacket had already been broken by the strong wind, and now it was being poured on by the cold water. When he temporarily tied the crack in the water pipe with rubber and wire, his soaked cotton-padded jacket flowed water like a water column.
    He arrived at the drill hole where he had worked yesterday. At this time, it was already bright, and the people working during the day had already gone to work.
    The drill hole could only be dug manually first, and the imposing drilling machine seemed powerless for the time being. When people dug below, soil, sand, or stones would constantly fall down. Necks were often filled with sand, and sometimes walnut-sized stones would fall sharply from the head and back.
    The flying sand enveloped the drill hole like a smoke screen. Although the people working in the hole were wearing masks, their nostrils and teeth were still covered with sand. Their mouths felt like they were stuffed with something, their saliva seemed to have been sucked dry, and their throats were choked with smoke, as if they were about to crack.
    When the drill hole had been dug to a depth of about four meters, it was impossible to stay in the hole. The entire opening of the hole made a strange sound. It seemed like a pile of loose rocks was about to collapse immediately.
    Sun Xiang had been working below. The young drilling team members standing above saw this situation and shouted anxiously, "Master Sun, Master Sun, it's too dangerous below, come up quickly."
    This young man, who was tall but had a thin face and deep wrinkles on his forehead, had been silently persisting below, persisting.
    In our Anshan, in recent years, in order to further obtain underground mineral resources to meet the needs of steel smelting, geological drilling work is being carried out intensively in vast areas. From the Bohai Bay in the south to the Yalu River in the east, drilling team members are fighting hard against nature everywhere. And the difficulties Sun Xiang is currently encountering are just one of the countless difficulties encountered by drilling team members.
    At noon, he was squatting by a pile of dirt, resting, his mind filled with things about this drill hole. He accidentally looked up and saw a kind of reddish-brown soil that was moist and different from the ordinary soil he usually saw. He curiously grabbed a handful and squeezed it hard. The shiny soil tightly stuck together in a ball. Looking at the roadside, there were also some small pebbles. The pebbles were wrapped in the soil and seemed to be cemented, which was very different from the situation that was happening in the drill hole. He thought that this might solve the problem.
    He walked back to the drill hole. The dangerous signs of the collapse of the hole opening were even more obvious. No one was working in the drill hole temporarily, but several meters away, you could hear the stones falling into the hole, sounding like drums, shaking down the sand. The entire drill hole was like a large chimney emitting smoke.
    Everyone looked at each other, worried.
    Sun Xiang seemed to have found a way. He said excitedly to everyone, "Comrades, I have something that I think can help us."
      "What good thing!"
    He held up a ball of mud in front of everyone. He said, "This is it. It may help us solve the big problem."
    Everyone didn't understand what was going on. Sun Xiang called everyone to carry a basket of this kind of soil and sent people to fetch water. At that time, the strong wind was still blowing. A large ladle full of water was blown several feet away by a gust of wind, together with the ladle.
    Sun Xiang mixed the mud with water and mixed it with stones. The mud was like mortar and stuck to the stones. Sun Xiang said, "Let's use this method to turn the live stones into dead stones."
    Everyone was skeptical. They mixed the mud with water and threw it into the drill hole in lumps. Then they used the drill bit to push the mud to the surrounding area, naturally combining it with the live stones. The stones were stuck by the mud and did not fall down. Sure enough, an annoying and unsolvable problem was solved by Sun Xiang in this way.
    Drilling work began to proceed smoothly in this drill hole. By the time they got off work in the evening, the drilling had reached two meters.
    Although people had helped Sun Xiang change out of his wet cotton clothes at the beginning, it was not until they got off work that they realized that he had not rested since he went up the mountain last night. So, people urged him and chased him away from the airfield as usual.
    He walked down the mountain, and the wind had slowly subsided. He passed the 320 drill hole and saw that the mats on the roofs of the drilling team members' houses had been blown away, the wooden boards had been lifted off, and even some of the walls had been blown down. He stopped again to help everyone build the walls, and finally climbed onto the roof to help everyone cover the mats and top boards. People urged him to leave, but he stubbornly insisted on his own opinion. By the time everything was done, the temporary lights set up at the airfield had long begun to flicker with their bright light.
    Sun Xiang returned from the mountain after ten o'clock at night. He gently knocked on the door. Zhang Guizhi was still waiting for him, and hadn't had dinner yet. But Suozhu couldn't wait and had already fallen asleep sweetly with his clothes on.
    When Zhang Guizhi saw him return to the house, she complained, "The child kept wanting you, and you didn't come back until now. What did you come back for?"
    Sun Xiang said nonchalantly, "I told you a long time ago, don't wait for me. You should eat and sleep first; but you just can't change it."
      "You must have been frozen last night," Zhang Guizhi asked with concern.
    Sun Xiang said with a smile, "I'm still hot. Of course you'll freeze to death if you just stand there and do nothing."
    He finished his hot dinner and was very sleepy. He stood by the side of the kang, quietly looking at the sleeping Suozhu. The lamp wick of the oil lamp was blooming, and the quiet light shone on his small face. His even breathing and sweet snoring made Sun Xiang want to kiss Suozhu hard on the face, but he was afraid that his unshaven beard would prick him. That night, Sun Xiang leaned against Suozhu's side and fell asleep quickly without realizing it.

    昼夜之间
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者　陆灏
    机场上临时架设的电灯已经开始闪烁着它的浅淡的光芒，黑夜毫不留情地来到了。
    下班的时间早已过了。可是，钻探队分队长孙祥还是从这个钻孔走到那个钻孔，来回地忙碌着。他一会儿问问钻进的情形，或者是检查检查钻头；一会儿又弯着腰去帮助大家推着正在上坡的水车。他总是什么时候也不愿意自己有一点点空闲。
     “孙师傅，这里已经没有什么问题，你该回去啦！”
    “孙师傅，时间太晚了，你怎么还没有回去啊！”
    “孙师傅……”
    每天下班，这些话，钻探队员们真不知要说多少遍。这几乎成为一种习惯了。
    孙祥直到看见夜间的准备工作确实一切都就绪了，他才被大家撵着走下山来。
    满天的星光，亮澄澄地倾泻在崎岖的山路上，那嶙峋的山头，也被照得好像透明似地闪着光。因为没有风，树梢恬静地伸向天空，一动也不动。远处发电厂的烟囱，像喷泉似地笔笔直直地吐着烟，连弯也不转，升到了空中就散失了。
    他回到家里，已经是夜间九点多了。他的老婆张桂芝，还在油灯下做针线活；孩子锁柱伏在妈妈的腿上打盹，他听见门一响，马上机灵地睁开眼睛醒来了。
    每天晚上，张桂芝总是一直要耐心地等他回来吃晚饭，不管是天气多么晚，等得多么久，她总是把饭菜焖在锅里，一把火一把火温着它，不使它凉掉，一直等到他从山上回来为止。锁柱也是这样，他总要等他爸爸回了家，在爸爸的怀里靠一靠，或者要爸爸抱一会儿，才肯去睡觉。
    “那钻孔挖得怎么样？”孙祥一进门，张桂芝就这样问他。关于他的白天工作的情形，她好像早就从山上回来的人那里知道了。
      这几天，孙祥和他的钻探队员们，正碰上了一个十年九不遇的钻孔。这钻孔，是松软的砂砾地层，除了砂子，就是像核桃、鸡蛋或饭碗那样大的卵石。在这样的地方进行钻探工作是很困难的，只要一提起钻具，取出岩芯检查岩层地质情况的时候，钻孔就马上又被堵住了。当时先进的泥浆钻进法还没有传到这里，队上也没有技术人员，对于这样的钻孔，谁也拿不出个办法来。
    当然，工作是不能停止的。最后，大家商量先挖一个钻孔，看看地底下究竟是个什么情形。
    今天，是开始挖孔的第一天。
    “只挖了一人多深。一面挖，一面塌，看样子不好办。”孙祥忧愁地说。
    他走近灯前，张桂芝仔细一看他，全身砂土不要说，连眉毛和头发都好像上了一层颜色。她说：“你看看自己成了什么样儿了。”
    张桂芝赶紧给他去端洗脸水来。他伸手去拿镜子，他看见脸孔上只有两只眼睛在转动，自己活像个土人。
    那洗脸水换了好几次，次次都像泥浆一般，不等他洗完，锁柱已经爬到了他的身上。
    大约在十点多钟的时候，全家便睡了。
    可是，刚刚睡下不久，外面突然呼呼呼地起了大风。
    挂在窗户上的秫秸帘子，开始被刮得哗哗乱甩起来。窗户上糊的纸，也被吹得霹拍乱响。树梢呼啸着发出尖厉的声音。孙祥在睡梦中，被这突如其来的大风惊醒了。
    虽然是连日的劳累，使他的脑袋嗡嗡发响，眼睛也睁不开，但他一醒，他的脑子立刻就想到山上。他想：山上的风一定更大。今天晚上留在山上的人，都是徒工和普通工。这样的大风，那个十几公尺高的钻塔会不会被刮倒？钻探机上用的电会不会发生问题……
    他猛然地坐起来，穿衣裳，对张桂芝说：“快起来，快起来，点灯。”
    “干什么呀？”
    “上山去！”
    “这样深更半夜去干什么？”张桂芝一面问；一面便起来点灯。可是，那屋子像漏了风一样，火柴划着了，马上又被吹灭，怎么也点不着。
    “你没有听见这风吗？”
    “听说这儿狼可多呢。”
    “狼多，我知道。”孙祥说：“要是出事故怎么办。”
    他把门闩往旁边一推，那两扇门就呼地一下被风吹开了。他跨出了门槛，张桂芝去关门；但是那门已被大风刮得顶住了。他回转身来，用两只手拉那两扇门，张桂芝在屋里使劲往外推，这样，里推外拉，好容易才把门关上。
    在孙祥住的屋子外边，还有一人多高的围墙，他来不及再去开那围墙的大门，一踪身，就跳了出去。刚着地，一阵大风，就把他刮倒在地上了。
    风呼拉呼拉地刮着，整个大地都好像在旋转，孙祥迎风走着，噎得气也透不过来。他摸出口袋里的手电筒，恰巧它又出了毛病不亮了。好在路还熟，他一面摸，一面走，有时甚至走了两步，还得向后退一退。快到半山，那大风好像用力地向他压来，要迫使他倒退回去似的。他朝机场了望，满地漆黑，好像什么都被刮得精光了。只有远处的发电厂，忽悠忽悠地闪着稀落的灯光。他想起过去有个钻孔，因为停电，没有把钻具提上来，结果停工三个月，心里就恨不得一步就走到机场上。
    他终于先来到了三一○钻孔。钻探队员们休息的木屋里，他走进去，看见人们正在休息。他问道：“同志们，钻具提上来了没有？”
    “没有。我们以为过一会儿，电就会来的呢。”
    他赶紧领着大家去把钻具提了上来。在大风和黑暗中，他又和大家在一起加固了钻塔的钢绳。他安置好三一○钻孔的工作以后，又到其他两个钻孔去了。
    所有的钻孔全是一样，都因为停电而陷入黑暗里。他在漫天的大风中，简直是摸着蜿蜒的山道，才算走到了山下队部。给发电厂打了个电话，知道是因为线路断了，电过不来。
    大风疯狂地刮着，满山的砂土被刮得像下雨似的。孙祥和几个钻探队员们，伛着腰去检查线路，他们在钻机的四百公尺以外，终于发现手指头一般粗的电线，受到大风的影响，不知怎么搞断了。
    电气工人从发电厂赶来了。钻探队员们帮着一块扶梯子接电线，梯子被刮得摇摇晃晃，像要倒下来似的；人们拉起电线来，被大风刮得站立也不能由自己作主，电线一松一紧，有时候竟把人弹出数公尺以外。他身上虽然穿着棉袄，可是山顶上的尖嘴的大风一直钻入骨髓里，仿佛穿着一件单布衫似地发抖。孙祥抽个空隙，他又摸回木屋去，拿了一些草绳来，每人给了一根，拴在腰里，这鼓满着风的棉袄，才像个口袋似地被绳子结住了。
    他们把电线接好，天已经快亮了。
    他又从这一个钻孔到另一个钻孔去，一种黎明前的睏人的疲倦袭击着他，他抖擞着精神，顶着怒吼的大风走着。
    走着走着，他的面前被一块像雾一般的白气蒙蒙的东西拦住了去路。他走上前一看，原来有一节水管破裂了。水像雨点般地喷溅着，大风又把它刮得老远老远，一大片地方像下着雨一样。
    水管的破裂将会严重地影响到钻机的用水，孙祥什么也不顾，扑向水管边上去。他的棉袄本来已经就像被大风钻破了，现在又被冰凉的水浇淋着，当他用胶皮和铁丝把水管的裂口暂时绑好的时候，他的湿透的棉袄像水柱似地流下水来。
    他来到了昨天工作的那个钻孔，这时候，天已经大亮，白天工作的人都已经上班了。
    钻孔还是只好先用人工在挖，威风凛凛的钻机暂时就显得无能为力了。人在下面挖，那土、砂子或石头，就不断地往下掉。脖子里常常被撒满了砂土，有时候，核桃大的石头，还会猛猛地从头上、背脊上掉下来。
    飞散的砂土像烟幕般地笼罩着那个钻孔。在孔里工作的人，虽然是带了口罩，但鼻孔和牙齿依然粘满了砂土，嘴里好像被塞满了东西，唾沫也似乎被吸干了，喉头呛得要冒烟，简直像要裂开一样。
    当钻孔大约已经挖到有四公尺深，孔里面简直是呆不住人了。整个的孔口，发出一种奇怪的响声，它好像一堆松散的乱石要立即坍塌下来。
    孙祥一直在下面工作，站在上面的年青的钻探队员见到这种情形，着急地喊着：“孙师傅，孙师傅，下面太危险，快上来吧。”
    这位个子长得高大，但脸庞瘦削，额上陷有很深的皱纹的年青人，一直是闷声不响地在下面坚持着，坚持着。
    我们的鞍山，这几年以来，为了进一步取得地下的矿藏，以满足熔炼钢铁的需要，地质钻探工作正在辽阔的地区紧张地进行。南至渤海湾，东至鸭绿江边，到处有钻探队员们在和大自然进行艰苦的搏斗。而孙祥目前所遇到的困难，只是钻探队员们遇到的无数困难中的一件。
    中午，他正蹲在一个土堆边休息，脑子里装满了关于这个钻孔的事情。他偶然一抬头，看到有种带赭红色的泥土，湿润润的和平常看到的泥土不大一样。他好奇地用手抓了一把，使劲一捏，那油亮亮的泥土便紧紧地粘成一团。再看那路边上，也有一些小卵石，卵石被裹在泥土中，都好像被砌住了，和钻孔上发生的情形很不一样。他想，这一下也许能解决问题呢。
    他走回钻孔上，孔口坍塌的险恶迹象已经更加明显。钻孔里暂时还没有人下去工作，但在几公尺以外，就可以听到掉入孔内的石头，响着擂鼓般地声音，震落着砂土，整个的钻孔像个大烟囱在冒烟了。
    大家面面相觑，正在发愁。
    孙祥好像找到了什么门道，他兴奋地对大家说：“同志们，有一样东西我看能帮咱们的忙。”
      “什么好东西啊！”
    他把手里的一团泥，往大家面前一举。他说：“就是这，它或许能帮咱们解决大困难。”
    大家不明白这是怎么回事儿，孙祥就招呼着大家去抬一筐这样的土来，又打发人去弄来了水。那时候，大风还在继续刮着，一个满盛着水的大瓢，一阵风，连瓢带水，就被刮到几丈以外。
    孙祥把泥掺上了水，又和石头拌在一起，那泥就像灰浆似地和石头粘在一起了。孙祥说：“就用这个办法，活石头就要把它变成死石头了。”
    大家半信半疑，用水和了泥，一团一团先往钻孔里扔，然后就用钻头顶，泥向四周挤，自然地和活石头和在一起，石头被泥沾住，就不往下掉了。果然，一个恼人的无法解决的困难，就这样被孙祥解决了。
    钻探工作开始在这个钻孔顺利地进行，到晚上下班的时候，钻进已到达了两公尺。
    人们虽然一开始就帮助孙祥换去了身上的湿棉衣，但一直到下班的时候，才发现他从昨天半夜上山以后，到现在还没有休息。于是人们就像往日一样，催着他，撵着他，离开了机场。
    他走下山来，风已慢慢地小下来。他走过三二○钻孔，看见钻探队员们房顶上的席子已被刮掉了，木板被掀掉了，甚至有的墙壁也被刮倒了。他又停下来，帮助大家垒墙，最后又爬到房顶上去帮助大家盖席子，顶木板。人们催他走，他固执地坚持着自己的意见。等到什么都弄好，机场上临时架设的电灯，已早就开始闪烁着它的亮光了。
    孙祥从山上回来，已经是晚上十点多钟了。他轻轻地敲着门，张桂芝还在等着他，没有吃晚饭呢；而锁柱却等不及，已经和衣甜甜地睡着了。
    张桂芝一见他回到屋里，她抱怨地说：“孩子一直要你，到现在才回来。你还回来干什么？”
    孙祥毫不在乎地说：“我早说过，不要你们等。你们应该先吃饭，先睡觉；但就是改不了。”
      “昨天晚上冻得够呛吧。”张桂芝关切地问。
    孙祥笑着说：“我还热呢。光站着不干事，那当然要冻死的。”
    他吃完了热喷喷的晚饭，已经很困了。他站在炕边上，静静地看着熟睡的锁柱，油灯的灯头开着花，那悠静的灯光照在他的小脸上，他的均匀的呼吸和甜蜜的鼾声，使孙祥竟不禁要用脸狠狠地去亲锁柱，但又怕自己长久不刮的胡子扎着他。这一夜，孙祥靠着锁柱的身边，不知不觉地很快就睡着了。
