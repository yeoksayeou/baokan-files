Soviet "Pravda"
    "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Lassakin, comments on Dulles's talks in Paris.
    Lassakin said: In the week from March 29 to April 5, the U.S. Secretary of State delivered two bellicose speeches. He demanded that America's allies immediately draw up a "joint ultimatum" against the Chinese people, and openly threatened to expand the war in Southeast Asia. Apparently, the United States believed that Dulles's orders would be unconditionally executed by Western Europe. However, in London, and especially in Paris, Washington's adventurous plans did not receive the support that the U.S. aggression group had hoped for. This, of course, is not due to the personal positions of certain European diplomats, but mainly due to the irresistible desire of the European people to maintain peace—they cannot ignore the will of the people.
    The French newspaper "Combat" said: Even before Dulles went to Europe, France and Britain had "unofficially notified Washington that the American proposal was untimely, more dangerous than beneficial." British and French newspapers said that neither Britain nor France was willing to be drawn into the gamble suggested by Washington. Neither Britain nor France is willing to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the American monopoly capitalists who are preparing to ignite a fire in Southeast Asia.
    After Dulles held talks in London and Paris, communiqués were issued separately. A study of these documents reveals that Dulles has had to (at least temporarily) abandon his demand: to immediately issue a joint statement in the name of a group of capitalist countries, threatening to launch an anti-communist "crusade" in Asia under the guise of "joint action." The "Wall Street Journal" of April 14 said that Dulles is no longer insisting on issuing a "joint action" statement. The newspaper said that Dulles now only requires the leaders of ten countries (members who will participate in this alliance in the future) to "privately (!)" reach an informal agreement, guaranteeing joint action in the future.
    American newspapers hinted that an "informal agreement" had been drafted during talks in London and Paris, but the British or French governments believed that this conspiracy could not be revealed on the eve of the Geneva Conference, because the vast majority of the European public attached such importance to the Geneva Conference.
    The part of the London and Paris communiqués that mentions the planned "Pacific Pact" is also noteworthy.
    Western European newspapers commented that the American ruling group intends to organize an exclusive group of countries in Asia similar to the North Atlantic Group. The initiators of the Pacific Pact plan intend to first pull colonial countries and Asian countries under puppet regimes into this new military group.
    Every unbiased person will easily understand: the Pacific Pact is used to make a part of Asian countries oppose another part of Asian countries.
    This new conspiracy of aggression pact has aroused legitimate vigilance in London and Paris. For example, "Le Monde" said that the British public is very indifferent to the new American diplomatic policy. The newspaper said that the Pacific Pact is in danger of becoming a "White Holy Alliance," "If this is the case, the political effectiveness of the Pacific Pact will be completely lost."
    French newspapers pointed out that the Pacific Pact plan and the "internationalization of the Indochina War" are both threats to French interests.
    Lassakin finally said: Dulles left Paris on April 15. French diplomats gave him all the official courtesies that an American Secretary of State should receive. But all these ostentatious displays did not give the French public the impression that Dulles had hoped for. French patriots are more determined to demand an end to the Indochina War. They are pleased to see that the enemy of peace's conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference has not succeeded.
    British "Daily Worker"
    London's "Daily Worker" published a commentary by Arthur Clegg on the 12th, saying: "Mr. Dulles came here as an enemy of Britain, ... because he is asking Britain to oppose the independence of the Indochinese people, but he is striking at British independence."
    The author wrote: "If a signed and sealed statement is issued, British troops must obey his orders and accept his instructions to participate in the war. Moreover, two weeks before the extremely important Geneva International Conference is held, the British government must guarantee that it will not speak or act except to accept Washington's orders. ... This is the purpose of the 'statement' announced by Dulles. He came to London to force the British government to sign this 'statement.' This is a great insult to Britain."
    Clegg wrote, referring to the widespread public demand for a ceasefire in Indochina, "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam proposed a ceasefire five months ago. In the past five months, the killings in Indochina have continued because the repeatedly proposed ceasefire proposals have been ignored and cast aside, and now, as a result, the United States has reached the point of 'almost' participating in the Indochina War and is trying to drag Britain into the war."
    Clegg concluded, "Peace in Indochina, the success of the Geneva Conference, and the expulsion of Dulles and his supporters—these must be the demands of the British people, and this is the road to British independence."
    Indonesian Newspapers
    "Indonesia News" believes that the "joint action" planned by the United States is another "playing with fire" by the United States. It also pointed out that once the Indochina War expands, "the entire South Asia will be directly endangered." The newspaper emphasized that Asian countries must resist American intimidation and threats, and must launch a joint action demanding a ceasefire in Indochina to counter the so-called "joint action" directed by the United States to expand the Indochina War.
    "Social Messenger" editorial said that Indonesia must be vigilant against participating in any alliance that violates Indonesia's independent and autonomous policy.
    American Union Newspapers
    The American "Ford News" published an article by K. Strado, chairman of the Automobile and Aircraft Industry Workers Union branch, sharply criticizing the policy adopted by the American ruling group to expand the Indochina War.
    The author wrote that the government uses all propaganda tools to make the American people accustomed to the idea that we participate in the Indochina War. ... Our local union members do not want to see an American youth sacrifice for the fruitless attempt to maintain the last remnants of colonialism in Asia.
    The mining and smelting workers union organ "Union News" reported that the union held a conference of representatives in Denver to discuss wage issues. The meeting passed a resolution requesting the U.S. government to take immediate measures to stop the Indochina War. The resolution also called for the conclusion of an international agreement declaring atomic and hydrogen weapons illegal, and demanded that the United States "express its willingness to make mutual concessions and resolve fundamental differences at the upcoming Geneva Conference, and take a step forward on the road to achieving genuine and comprehensive peace."

### 各国舆论要求实现印度支那和平反对美国扩大战争的阴谋活动

    各国舆论要求实现印度支那和平反对美国扩大战争的阴谋活动
    苏联“真理报”
    “真理报”驻巴黎记者拉萨金评论杜勒斯在巴黎的会谈。
    拉萨金说：从三月二十九日到四月五日的一周中，美国国务卿发表了两次好战的演说。他要求美国的盟友们立刻拟订一个针对中国人民的“联合最后通牒”，并公开威胁要在东南亚扩大战争。显然美国自以为杜勒斯的命令会被西欧无条件地执行。然而在伦敦、尤其是在巴黎，华盛顿的冒险计划并没有得到美国侵略集团所希望的支持。这当然不是由于这一些或那一些欧洲外交家个人的立场，而主要是由于欧洲人民维护和平的不可抗拒的愿望——他们不能无视人民的意志。
    法国报纸“战斗报”说：甚至在杜勒斯还没有到欧洲去以前，法国和英国就已经“非正式地通知华盛顿说，美国的建议不合时宜，危险多而好处少”。英国和法国的报纸说，无论英国或法国都不愿意卷入华盛顿所建议的赌博。无论英国或法国都不愿意在美国垄断资本家们正预备在东南亚煽起的火焰里去替美国火中取栗。
    杜勒斯在伦敦和巴黎进行会谈以后，分别发表了公报。只要对这些文件加以研究，就可以看出杜勒斯已经不得不（至少是暂时地）放弃他的这种要求：以一帮资本主义国家的名义，立即发表一个联合声明，扬言要在“联合行动”的幌子下在亚洲发起反共的“十字军”。四月十四日的“华尔街日报”说，杜勒斯现在不再坚持发表“联合行动”的声明了。这个报纸说，现在，杜勒斯所要求的只是由十个国家（将来参加这个联盟的成员）的领袖“在私下（！）取得非正式的协议”，保证在将来采取联合行动。
    美国的报纸暗示说，在伦敦和巴黎进行会谈时已经拟订“非正式协议”，但是英国或法国政府都认为在日内瓦会议前夕不能透露这种密谋，因为欧洲广大阶层的公众对于日内瓦会议是这样地重视。
    伦敦和巴黎公报中谈到计划中的“太平洋公约”的部分，也是值得注意的。
    西欧的报纸评论说：美国的统治集团打算在亚洲组织一个类似北大西洋集团的排他的国家集团。发起太平洋公约计划的人，打算首先把殖民地国家以及在傀儡政权统治下的亚洲国家拉进这个新的军事集团里。
    每一个没有偏见的人都会很容易地了解：太平洋公约是用来使亚洲的一部分国家去反对另一部分国家的。
    这个新的侵略公约的阴谋，已经在伦敦和巴黎引起正当的警惕。例如“世界报”说，英国公众对于美国外交的新政策很冷淡。这个报纸说，太平洋公约有成为“白种人神圣同盟”的危险，“如果这样的话，太平洋公约的政治效力就要完全丧失了”。
    法国报纸指出：太平洋公约计划和“印度支那战争的国际化”，都是对于法国利益的威胁。
    拉萨金最后说：杜勒斯在四月十五日离开了巴黎。法国的外交官们给了他一个美国的国务卿所应得到的各种官场上的面子。但是所有这些排场，并没有使得法国公众产生杜勒斯所期望的印象。法国的爱国人士们更坚决地要求结束印度支那战争。他们看到这个和平的敌人破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋没有得逞而感到满意。
    英国“工人日报”
    伦敦“工人日报”十二日登载了阿瑟·克莱格的评论，他说：“杜勒斯先生作为英国的敌人来到这里，……因为他要求英国反对印度支那人民的独立，但是他是在打击英国的独立。”
    作者写道：“如果发表了一篇签字盖章的声明，英国军队就必须听候他的吩咐，接受他的指令去参加战争。而且在极端重要的日内瓦国际会议召开的两个星期之前，英国政府必须保证除了接受华盛顿的命令之外就不说话不行动。……这就是杜勒斯所宣布的‘声明’的目的，他到伦敦来就是要强迫英国政府在这个‘声明’上签字的。这对于英国是莫大的侮辱。”
      克莱格在谈到广大公众要求在印度支那实现停火时写道，“越南民主共和国在五个月之前就提出了实行停火的建议。在过去五个月中，印度支那的杀戮仍在进行，因为一再提出的停战建议被置之不理和抛在一边，而现在，结果是美国已到了‘快要’参加印度支那战争的地步，并在设法把英国也拖入战争。”
    克莱格最后说，“印度支那的和平、日内瓦会议的成功以及杜勒斯及其支持者的滚蛋——这些必须是英国人民的要求，这是走向英国独立的道路。”
      印度尼西亚报纸
      “印尼新闻报”认为美国策划中的“联合行动”是美国又一次的“玩火”行为。并指出，印度支那战争一旦扩大，“整个南亚洲都将直接受到危害”。该报强调说，亚洲国家必须反抗美国的恫吓威胁，必须发动一个要求在印度支那实现停战的联合行动，以对抗美国导演下的旨在扩大印度支那战争的所谓“联合行动”。
    “社会使者报”的社论说，印尼必须提高警惕，反对参加任何违反印尼独立自主政策的同盟。
    美国工会报纸
    美国“福特新闻”登载了汽车和飞机工业工人工会分会主席克·斯特拉多的文章，对美国统治集团所采取的扩大印度支那战争的政策作了尖锐的抨击。
    作者写道，政府利用一切宣传工具，使美国人民习惯于我们参加印度支那战争的思想。……我们地方工会分会的会员，不愿看到有一个美国青年为了保持在亚洲的殖民主义最后残余的无结果的企图而牺牲。
    开采冶炼工人工会机关报“工会报”报道说，该工会在丹佛举行代表会议，讨论工资问题。会议通过决议，要求美国政府立刻采取措施，停止印度支那战争。该决议还要求缔结关于宣布原子武器和氢武器为非法的国际协定，并要求美国在“即将举行的日内瓦会议上表示愿意互相让步，愿意解决基本分歧，并在达成真正全面和平的道路上前进一步”。（据新华社讯）
