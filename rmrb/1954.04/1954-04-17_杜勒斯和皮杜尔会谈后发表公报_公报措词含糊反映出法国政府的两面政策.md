Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: TASS, Paris, April 15th—The communiqué issued after the talks between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and French Foreign Minister Bidault is in many ways similar to the communiqué issued in London on April 13 after the talks between Dulles and Eden. The communiqué deliberately uses vague and generalized wording. This reflects the French government's two-faced policy. On the one hand, it is constantly under pressure from the United States to continue the war in Indochina, while on the other hand, it cannot ignore the increasingly strong public demand to end the war in Indochina.

It should be pointed out that neither the Paris communiqué nor the London communiqué contains any threats against the People's Republic of China or any reference to "joint action," that is, they do not include the demands recently made by Dulles to his British and French allies. On the 15th, newspapers of various tendencies in Paris emphasized this situation. For example, "Franc-Tireur" commented that in the communiqué "there is no mention of any warning to China..."

"Combat" wrote: "The warning to China has been put back in the briefcase. Now the most important thing is the Geneva Conference..."

The communiqué stated that Dulles and Bidault recognized that "the basic goal at the Geneva Conference is to seek peace in Indochina."

The Paris communiqué also mentioned that France agreed to study Dulles' proposed plan to establish a military alliance in Southeast Asia similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Some newspapers emphasized that this plan is a threat to France. For example, "Combat" pointed this out, saying: "This type of plan is dangerous for France. In fact, the United States may use these plans as a means to include some countries that Paris wants to retain within the French Federation into the American sphere of influence."

Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: More and more facts prove that the actual actions of the U.S. ruling clique are completely contrary to their words.

Recently, in the joint communiqué issued by the United States and France after the Paris talks, the United States expressed its unwillingness to "prolong" the war in Indochina and described the organization of aggressive blocs as being for France's "interests." However, the actions of U.S. official figures since the Berlin Conference and the information recently revealed by U.S. newspapers have repeatedly proved that the actual actions of the U.S. ruling clique are completely contrary to these hypocritical words. An article by Drew Pearson published in the U.S. "Washington Post" on April 6th said: "What the State Department is doing is to persuade France to keep French troops in Indochina until U.S. officers can train the local army. To achieve this goal, American diplomats have been urging the French not to agree to a ceasefire, because a ceasefire is equal to surrender." "New York Times" reporter Dana Schmidt revealed that the U.S. government's idea is to force "France to continue fighting for another year or two," because by then, the United States will have organized and trained the puppet army. An article by Gordon Walker published in the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" said: "If the French can heed (American) advice, ignore the communist peace proposals and continue the Indochina war, then a plan to train Vietnamese troops under American guidance will probably become a long-term intervention plan that Washington may adopt and put into effect."

Facts prove that what the U.S. ruling clique is actually doing is completely the opposite of what they are verbally proclaiming. For the benefit of their small clique, they are intensifying their coercion of France to continue the war that damages its own interests, and are using this opportunity to seize the training and control of the puppet army in order to further replace France's position in Indochina.

### 杜勒斯和皮杜尔会谈后发表公报  公报措词含糊反映出法国政府的两面政策

    杜勒斯和皮杜尔会谈后发表公报
    公报措词含糊反映出法国政府的两面政策
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯和法国外交部长皮杜尔会谈后发表的公报，在许多方面类似杜勒斯和艾登会谈后四月十三日在伦敦发表的公报。公报故意措词含糊和一般化。这反映了法国政府的两面政策。它一方面经常受到美国要它继续进行印度支那战争的压力，同时又不能不顾及舆论关于停止印度支那战争的日益强烈的要求。
    应该指出，无论是在巴黎公报或是在伦敦公报中，都没有对于中华人民共和国进行威胁或任何有关“联合行动”的话，也就是没有包括杜勒斯最近向他的英、法盟国提出的要求。十五日巴黎各种倾向的报纸都着重谈到这种情况。例如，“义勇军报”评论说，在公报中“一点也没有提到作为向中国提出的任何警告……。”
    “战斗报”写道：“对中国的警告被放到公文包中去了。现在最重要的是日内瓦会议……”。
    公报中说，杜勒斯和皮杜尔承认“在日内瓦会议上的基本目标是谋求印度支那的和平”。
    巴黎公报中还提到：法国同意研究杜勒斯提出的在东南亚建立类似北大西洋公约的军事同盟的计划。
    有些报纸着重指出，这个计划是对法国的威胁。例如“战斗报”就指出这一点说：“这一类计划，对法国来说，是危险的。实际上，美国可能以这些计划作为手段，把巴黎所要保留在法兰西联邦内的一些国家包括到美国的势力范围中去。”
    【新华社十六日讯】越来越多的事实证明，美国统治集团的实际行动与言辞是完全相背的。
    最近，美国在巴黎会谈以后与法国共同发表的公报中，表示不愿意“延长”印度支那的战争，并且把组织侵略集团说成是为了法国的“利益”。但是，自柏林会议以来美国官方人物的所作所为和美国报纸最近透露出来的消息已经一再证明：美国统治集团的实际行动与这些虚伪的言词是完全相背的。美国“华盛顿邮报”四月六日刊载的德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章说：“国务院正在做的事情，就是说服法国在美国军官能够训练好当地军队以前，要继续把法国军队留在印度支那。为了达到这个目的，美国外交家们一直在敦促法国人不要答应休战，因为休战等于投降。”“纽约时报”记者丹纳·史密德透露说，美国政府的想法是迫使“法国继续再打一年或两年”，因为到那时候，美国已经把伪军组织和训练起来了。美国“基督教科学箴言报”刊载的戈登·华尔克的一篇文章说：“假使法国人可以听信（美国的）劝告，对共方的和平建议置之不理并且继续进行印度支那战争，那么，一个在美国指导下的训练越南军队的计划，大概就会成为华盛顿可能采取的长期干涉计划而生效。”
    事实证明，美国统治集团实际上做的正好与他们口头上宣扬的完全相反，他们为了自己一小撮人的利益，正在加紧胁迫法国把损害它自己利益的战争打下去，并且利用这个机会夺取伪军的训练权和控制权，以便进一步把法国在印度支那的地位取而代之。
