    **The Soviet People Marching Towards Communism**
    Criteria for Selecting Participants in the Agricultural Exhibition

    On April 8, the Central Committee of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition announced a resolution on the criteria and conditions for selecting participants in the 1954-1955 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. Due to the continuous development of various sectors of socialist agriculture, the standards stipulated in the resolution for crop production, animal husbandry, agricultural mechanization, electrification, adoption of agricultural technology, and land reclamation and water conservancy construction are higher than those for participants in the 1939-1940 Agricultural Exhibition. This resolution has been approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Agricultural Workers Across Regions Launch Competitions

    Agricultural workers across the Soviet Union are widely launching socialist competitions to strive for participation in the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, which will open in Moscow on August 1 this year. They pledge to complete the sowing of spring crops in the shortest possible time and improve the quality of spring plowing and sowing to increase agricultural production and improve the productivity of livestock products. In the Russian Federation, the advanced tractor drivers of the Bogoslovsk Machine Tractor Station in the Stavropol Territory decided to plow 1,200 hectares of land per tractor, and harvest more than 30 quintals of grain per hectare (1 hectare equals 15 mu, 1 quintal equals 200 jin). The Shevchenko Collective Farm in the Molotov Region and the Molotov Collective Farm in the Poltava Region of the Ukrainian Republic launched a competition to increase vegetable production. The Pantinova vegetable team of the Shevchenko Collective Farm decided to increase the yield per hectare of cabbage to 500 quintals, tomatoes to 350 quintals, and cucumbers to 200 quintals. The Lenin Collective Farm in the Sumy Region of the Ukrainian Republic guarantees that this year's yield per hectare will reach 20 quintals for grain, 245 quintals for sugar beets, 26 quintals for corn, and 17 quintals for sunflowers in order to strive for participation in the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. The Kalinin Collective Farm in the Andijan Region of the Kyrgyz Republic, in order to strive for participation in the Agricultural Exhibition, decided to increase the yield per hectare of cotton to 40 quintals this year.

      Youth Tractor Teams' Competition

    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture have passed a resolution on organizing a socialist competition for youth tractor teams in national machine tractor stations. The resolution calls on the youth tractor teams of the national machine tractor stations to complete the tasks stipulated in the national plan to increase the yield per unit area of all crops, to carry out field work in a timely and high-quality manner, to effectively use machines and tractors, and to actively participate in the cause of further developing public animal husbandry, in order to strive for the victorious completion of the tasks formulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government for agriculture. The resolution specifies in detail the number of awards and methods of the competition. Outstanding youth tractor teams and their members who achieve the best work indicators in the competition will receive various mobile red flags, medals, bonuses and certificates from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture according to their ranking. The competition is summarized twice a year by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, with a preliminary summary on July 1 to propose candidates for competition winners, and a final summary of the competition results on December 1.

      Construction Outlook of Eastern Siberia

    The large-scale construction work in the Eastern Siberian region of the Soviet Union is proceeding victoriously in accordance with the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    A hydroelectric power station, the largest in the eastern Soviet Union, is being built on the Angara River. Embankment construction and steel pile wall driving are underway at the hydroelectric power station construction site. After the power station is completed, its power generation will exceed that of the largest European Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station by a factor of one, which is sufficient to supply the needs of the newly emerging lead-making, chemical, and mining industries in the Lake Baikal region, and will have a huge effect on the development of the region's industrial productive forces.

    The mechanized giant Ostrovo port is being built on the Lena River, one of Siberia's largest waterways. Now 70 percent of the port’s project has been completed. After the new port is completed, it will promote freight transport in the northern region. Goods transported north can be concentrated here, and large ships can moor here. Powerful machine tools, cranes, bulldozers, etc. manufactured by the Irkutsk Machinery Manufacturing Industry will be transported in large quantities from the Lena River to the north to supply the needs of the ever-developing economic construction in the far north.

    On the basis of the development of heavy industry, Eastern Siberia is currently vigorously building many daily necessities and food factories. For example, Irkutsk is building clothing factories, milk factories, knitting factories, and chemical dry cleaning factories.

    Eastern Siberia is buried with large amounts of hard coal, iron ore, non-ferrous metals, mica, and salt, and possesses abundant power resources and various building materials. The potential power generation capacity contained in the Angara River water alone is more than the sum of the Volga River, the Dnieper River, the Don River, and the Kama River. The taiga can produce billions of cubic meters of wood. In the Tsarist era, Eastern Siberia was a desolate border area for exiles, and abundant mineral deposits and power resources were abandoned. Only after the October Revolution did the economy and culture of Eastern Siberia develop rapidly. From 1917 to 1950, the total industrial output of Eastern Siberia increased by 18 times, and the number of employees increased by 8 times. Due to the greatly improved level of agricultural mechanization, the wheat planting area increased by 3 times, the planting area of industrial raw material crops increased by 4 times, and the planting area of potatoes increased by 6 times.

    Academy of Sciences Working Team Goes to Frontier Area to Work

    The Soviet Academy of Sciences is organizing a working team to go to the Altai Frontier Area and Kazakhstan to help local researchers and collective farmers carry out the work of reclaiming virgin land and cultivated wasteland.

    Professor Sergei Sobolev, the leader of the working team composed of soil scientists, botanists, and geographers, told a TASS reporter:

    The Altai Frontier Area, which stretches from the border of Mongolia and China to the Kazakh grasslands, is famous for its fertile land. However, most of this land (its area is equal to half of France, and larger than the total area of the British Isles) is still cultivated wasteland. But the climate in the Altai Frontier Area is very good. The harvest of the famous Altai wheat is very high. Professor Sobolev emphasized that in 1938, a collective farm in the Andreyev District of the Altai Frontier Area created a world record of harvesting 10.1 tons of winter wheat per hectare of land. In the post-war years, many places harvested 3 to 4 tons of grain per hectare of land.

    In the next two years, the Altai Frontier Area will reclaim 2 million hectares of virgin land and cultivated wasteland. Among them, 500,000 hectares of land will be sown with grain this spring. Scientists will help farmers choose new land for planting wheat and apply the best farming methods, and will guide them on methods to prevent soil erosion and remove weeds. Professor Sobolev finally said that many working teams of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have been working in the Altai Frontier Area and Kazakhstan for many years. They have drawn soil maps of these areas and conducted detailed studies of local climatic conditions. The research results of these working teams are of great significance for the successful development of these new areas.

    Exploration and Washing of Beautiful Gems

    The Soviet Academy of Sciences is holding a meeting to discuss the exploration and washing of gems. The meeting was attended by famous Soviet geologists and jewelers. Academician D. Shcherbakov pointed out in his speech that as many as 50 kinds of gems and semi-precious stones can be found in the Soviet Union. Many have been exhibited at exhibitions held by the Academy of Sciences. Here we can see all kinds of beautiful gems, including smoky topaz, green jade, and violet amethyst. Jewelry made of gems and Russian semi-precious stones is very popular among the Soviet people. The fact that the number of gem jewelry sold last year was four times that of the pre-war year 1940 is enough to illustrate the problem. The output of these jewelry is constantly increasing, and it should also be pointed out that their retail prices are constantly decreasing. For example, starting from April 1, their prices have been reduced by an average of 10%.

    Soviet geologists are stepping up the exploration of gems. New gem mines have been discovered in the Ural Mountains, a veritable treasure trove of Russian semi-precious stones. New mines have also been discovered in Ukraine and Transbaikalia. It is planned that gem production will increase greatly in the next few years. For this purpose, many new factories are being built in Odessa, Yerevan and many other cities in the Soviet Union.

    Trade Union Congress of Food Industry Workers

    The Congress of the Trade Union of Food Industry Workers of the Soviet Union lasted for three days and closed in Moscow on the 13th.

    Aslanov, Secretary of the Trade Union of Food Industry Workers of the Soviet Union, made a report at the meeting. He said that the food industry workers are successfully implementing the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government on "expanding food production and improving food quality." Food production is constantly increasing. The state is allocating a large amount of funds to improve the working conditions of food industry workers. Last year, more than 160 million rubles were allocated to improve labor protection and safety equipment. Tobacco factories have been perfected with ventilation equipment. The manipulation of many machines has been automated. This year, hundreds of new kindergartens and nurseries will be opened for the children of food industry workers.

    Zotov, Minister of the Food Industry of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the meeting. He pointed out that last year, food industry enterprises produced 18.5 billion rubles more food than in 1952. The Soviet people have received more meat, fish, butter, milk, sugar and confectionery than in the past. This year, food production is further increasing. The government expresses great concern for the welfare of food industry workers. This year, 25,000 apartment buildings will be built for them. The social insurance budget will increase by about a quarter compared with last year, totaling about 1.4 billion rubles. This year, more than 124,000 food workers will go to sanatoriums and rest homes for recuperation.

    Uzbekistan Expands Cotton Fields

    The Uzbek Republic, one of the main cotton-producing areas in the Soviet Union, is currently vigorously building farmland irrigation systems in newly reclaimed areas to expand cotton planting area.

    The construction of irrigation systems is being carried out on a large scale in the Seravshan River Basin, a famous river in Uzbekistan. In Kashka-Darya and Samarkand Provinces, thousands of workers have excavated millions of cubic meters of soil in the riverbed of the Iski-Angar Canal, which dried up hundreds of years ago. This canal runs north and south through the two provinces, with a length of more than 180 kilometers. After it is dug, it will draw water from the Seravshan River to irrigate 183,000 hectares of land being reclaimed along the coast.

    In the Fergana Valley, known as the "Gem of Uzbekistan," 140,000 hectares of fertile land will be reclaimed in the central desert area in the next five years. To this end, a huge irrigation system is now being actively built here. A total of approximately 200 million cubic meters of soil will be excavated and 200,000 cubic meters of concrete will be poured during the construction of the irrigation system. Now the water of the Kara River has been blocked in the Kuigan-Yar area, allowing it to flow into the Stalin Great Fergana Canal to irrigate farmland. The Ura-Tokai Reservoir in Namangan Province is also about to be completed, and it will hold 100 million cubic meters of water.

      Increase Tea Yield Per Unit Area

    The Soviet Tea and Subtropical Crop Research Institute located in Anaseuli Village, Georgia, recently held a two-day scientific conference to discuss further increasing tea yield per unit area.

    Darigihan Takijie, a female member of the Natanebi Village Collective Farm and a socialist labor hero, made a very interesting report at the meeting. She is a tea planting innovator, and she talked about her method of cultivating tea trees. Using this method, her working team increased tea production by nearly 300% compared to the average tea production in the Republic of Georgia. Last year, her team harvested nearly 10,000 kilograms of tea leaves per hectare of land, while the original plan was only 2,600 kilograms.

    Her particularly effective method of increasing tea yield per unit area is to apply mineral and organic fertilizers during the growing season of tea trees.

    The scientific conference recommended widely promoting her method.

    Spring Fishing Starts in the Far East and Other Places

    Spring fishing has begun in the Soviet Far East and southern territorial waters. Fishermen in many other regions will also begin large-scale fishing soon. The task of the staff of state fishery enterprises and the fishermen of collective farms is to open up new fishing areas in the Barents Sea, the White Sea, the Far East and Siberia. Fishery consumer cooperatives pay close attention to serving fishermen, and directly supply them with all necessary goods and food on the fishing grounds. During the fishing season, food and various daily necessities will be transported to the fishing areas—fishing grounds, fish receiving stations and docks. To this end, the cooperative has about 1,000 ships. At the busiest time of fishing, there will be 20,000 trade workers serving the fishermen. In the Caspian Sea, 300 floating shops have been prepared, and these shops will regularly go to the fishing areas to work. A floating trade union company will be established on a large ship. Here, shops, canteens and various welfare facilities serving fishermen will be opened.

    向共产主义前进的苏联人民
    农业展览会参加者的评选标准
    苏联农业展览会中央委员会八日公布了关于评选一九五四—一九五五年苏联农业展览会参加者的标准和条件的决议。由于社会主义农业各部门的不断发展，决议中为农作物生产、饲畜业、农业机械化、电气化、农业技术的采用及开垦荒地和水利建设等规定的标准，比一九三九—一九四○年的农业展览会参加者的标准高。这项决议已经苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会批准。
    各地农业劳动者展开竞赛
    苏联各地农业劳动者广泛展开社会主义竞赛，争取参加今年八月一日在莫斯科开幕的苏联农业展览会。他们保证在最短时期内播种完春播作物，并提高春耕、春播的工作质量，以增加农业生产并提高牲畜的产品生产率。在俄罗斯联邦，斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的博戈斯洛夫斯克机器拖拉机站的先进拖拉机手决定用每台拖拉机耕地一千二百公顷（一公顷合十五市亩），每公顷土地要收获三十多公担谷物（一公担合二百市斤）。莫洛托夫州谢夫钦科集体农庄和乌克兰共和国波尔塔发州的莫洛托夫集体农庄彼此展开了增加蔬菜产量的竞赛。谢夫钦科集体农庄潘蒂诺娃蔬菜小组决定把每公顷白菜的单位面积产量提高到五百公担，番茄提高到三百五十公担，黄瓜提高到二百公担。乌克兰共和国苏米州列宁集体农庄保证今年每公顷谷物的单位面积产量达到二十公担，甜菜二百四十五公担，玉蜀黍二十六公担，向日葵十七公担，以争取参加苏联农业展览会。吉尔吉斯共和国安集延州的加里宁集体农庄为了争取参加农业展览会，决定今年要把棉花的单位面积产量提高到四十公担。
      青年拖拉机队的竞赛
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和苏联农业部，通过了关于组织全国机器拖拉机站青年拖拉机队进行社会主义竞赛的决议。决议号召全国机器拖拉机站青年拖拉机队在竞赛中完成国家计划规定的提高一切农作物单位面积产量的任务，及时地、高质量地进行田间工作，有效地利用机器和拖拉机，积极参加进一步发展公有饲畜业的事业，以争取胜利完成苏联共产党和政府为农业所制订的任务。决议详细规定了竞赛的奖励名额和办法。凡在竞赛中达到最好的工作指标的优秀青年拖拉机队及其队员，将依等次获得共青团中央委员会和苏联农业部的各种流动红旗、奖章、奖金和奖状。竞赛每年由共青团中央委员会和苏联农业部作两次总结，七月一日进行初步总结，提出竞赛优胜者候选人，十二月一日最后总结出竞赛结果。
      东西伯利亚的建设面貌
    苏联东西伯利亚地区的大规模的建设工作，正在按照第五个五年计划胜利进行中。
    安加拉河上正在兴建一个苏联东部最大的水电站。水电站工地上正在进行修筑堤坝和打钢桩墙的工作。水电站建成以后，它的发电量将超过欧洲最大的第聂伯水电站的一倍，足够供应贝加尔湖地区新兴的制铅、化学和采矿工业的需要，对发展该区的工业生产力有巨大的作用。
    西伯利亚最大的水道之一——勒拿河上正在建筑机械化的巨大的奥斯特罗沃港口。现在港口的工程已经完成了百分之七十。新港口建成以后，将促进北部地区的货运。北运的货物可以在这里集中，大轮船可以在这里碇泊。伊尔库次克机器制造业制造的效力强大的工作母机、起重机、推土机等将大量地从勒拿河运到北部去，以供应极北地区日益发展的经济建设的需要。
    在重工业已经有了发展的基础上，东西伯利亚目前正在大力兴建许多日用品和食品工厂。例如，伊尔库次克正在建筑外衣工厂、牛奶工厂、针织工厂和化学洗染工厂。
    东西伯利亚地区埋藏着大量的硬煤、铁矿砂、有色金属、云母、食盐，并拥有丰富的动力资源和各种建筑材料。单是安加拉的河水所蕴藏的潜在发电能力就比伏尔加河、第聂伯河、顿河和卡马河的总和还要多。塔伊加可出产数十亿立方公尺的木材。在沙皇时代，东西伯利亚是流放犯人的荒凉边区，丰富的矿藏和动力资源被弃置着。直到十月革命后，东西伯利西的经济和文化才迅速发展起来。从一九一七年到一九五零年，东西伯利亚工业总产量增为十八倍，职工人数增为八倍。由于农业机械化水平的大大提高，小麦播种面积增为三倍，工业原料作物的播种面积增为四倍，马铃薯的播种面积增为六倍。
    科学院工作队到边疆区工作
    苏联科学院正在组织工作队到阿尔泰边疆区和哈萨克去帮助当地的研究工作者和集体农民进行开垦熟荒地的工作。
    由土壤学家、植物学家和地理学家组成的工作队队长谢尔盖·索波列夫教授对塔斯社记者说：
    从蒙古和中国边界一直伸展到哈萨克草原的阿尔泰边疆区是以土地肥沃而著名的。但是，这块土地（它的面积等于半个法国，大于英国本土的总面积）极大部分还是熟荒地。但阿尔泰边疆区的气候很好。著名的阿尔泰小麦的收获量是非常高的。索波列夫教授着重指出，一九三八年阿尔泰边疆区安德烈耶夫区的一个集体农庄创造了每公顷土地收获十点一吨冬小麦的世界纪录。在战后的几年中，许多地方每公顷土地都收获了三吨到四吨的谷物。
    在今后两年中，阿尔泰边疆区将开垦两百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地。其中五十万公顷的土地将在今年春天播种谷物。科学家们将帮助农民选择播种小麦的新土地和应用最好的耕作方法，并将指导他们防止土壤蚀溃和除杂草的方法。索波列夫教授最后说，苏联科学院还有许多工作队在阿尔泰边疆区和哈萨克做了很多年的工作。他们绘制了这些地区的土壤图，并对当地的气候条件作了详细的研究。这些工作队的研究结果，对顺利发展这些新地区有很大的意义。
    探掘和洗制美丽的宝石
    苏联科学院正在举行会议，讨论探掘和洗制宝石的问题。到会的有苏联的著名的地质学家和珠宝工人。德·谢尔巴科夫院士在会上发言指出，在苏联可以发现的宝石和次等宝石多达五十种。有许多已在科学院举办的展览会上展出。在这里我们可以看到各种各样的美丽的宝石，其中有像烟雾一样的黄玉，绿色的翡翠，紫罗兰色的紫水晶等。用宝石和俄罗斯的次等宝石制成的饰物很受苏联人民的欢迎。去年卖掉的宝石饰物为战前一九四○年的四倍，仅此一点已足以说明问题了。这些饰物的产量在不断增加，而且还应该指出，它们的零售价格在不断减低。例如，从四月一日开始，它们的价格平均又减低了百分之十。
    苏联地质学家正在加紧探掘宝石。在名副其实的俄罗斯次等宝石宝库乌拉尔已经发现了新的宝石矿。在乌克兰和外贝加尔地区也发现了新矿。计划在今后几年中，宝石产量还会大大增加，为了这个目的，许多新工厂正在敖德萨、埃里温和苏联其他许多城市兴建起来。
    食品工业工人工会代表大会
    苏联食品工业工人工会代表大会历时三天，已于十三日在莫斯科闭幕。
    苏联食品工业工人工会书记阿斯兰诺夫在会上作了报告。他说，食品工业工人正在顺利地执行着苏联共产党和政府关于“扩大食品生产和改进食品质量”的决议。食品的产量正在不断增加。国家正在拨出大笔款项来改善食品工业工人的劳动条件，去年已拨出一亿六千多万卢布来改善劳动保护和安全设备。烟草工厂已得到了完善的通风设备。许多机器的操使都已自动化了。今年将为食品工业工人的儿童开设几百个新的幼儿园和托儿所。
    苏联食品工业部部长佐托夫在会上发表演说。他指出，去年食品工业企业比一九五二年多生产了价值一百八十五亿卢布的食品。苏联人民得到了比过去更多的肉类、鱼类、牛油、牛乳、糖和糖果。今年食品的产量正在进一步增加。政府对食品工业工人的福利表示极大的关怀。今年将为他们建造二万五千幢公寓房屋。社会保险预算约比去年增加四分之一，总数约为十四亿卢布。今年将有十二万四千多个食品工人到疗养院和休养所去休养。
    乌兹别克扩大棉田
    苏联主要产棉区之一乌兹别克共和国，目前正在新开垦的地区大力建设农田灌溉系统，以扩大植棉面积。
    在乌兹别克著名的大河——塞拉夫森河流域，灌溉系统的建设正大规模展开。在卡什卡—达里亚和萨马尔坎德州，几千工人已在几百年前干涸了的伊斯基—安加尔运河河床处挖掘了几百万公方泥土。这条运河纵贯两州南北，长达一百八十多公里。掘成后，它将引塞拉夫森河的河水灌溉沿岸正在开垦的十八万三千公顷土地。
    在享有“乌兹别克的宝石”称誉的弗尔干纳山谷，今后五年中，将在中部沙漠地带开垦十四万公顷肥沃的土地。为此，这儿现在正在积极建设巨大的灌溉系统。在建设灌溉系统过程中总共将挖掘约二亿公方泥土，浇灌二十万公方混凝土。现在在库伊甘·雅尔地方已经堵住了卡拉河的河水，使它流入斯大林大弗尔干纳运河，以灌溉农田。纳曼根州的乌拉·托卡伊水库也即将建成，它将容水一亿公方。
      提高茶的单位面积产量
    设在格鲁吉亚的阿纳苏利村的苏联茶和亚热带作物研究所最近举行了两天科学会议，讨论进一步提高茶的单位面积产量的问题。
    纳塔涅比村集体农庄女庄员、社会主义劳动英雄达里吉汉·塔基杰在会上作了一个非常有趣的报告。她是一个栽茶革新者，她谈到了她培养茶树的方法。她的工作小组用这种方法使产茶量超过了格鲁吉亚共和国的平均产茶量的将近百分之三百。去年，她的小组在每公顷土地上采了将近一万公斤茶叶，而原订计划只有二千六百公斤。
    她提高茶叶单位面积产量的特别有效的方法是在茶树生长时期施矿质肥料和有机肥料。
    科学会议建议广泛地推行她的方法。
    远东等地开始春季捕鱼
    苏联远东和南部领海已经开始春季捕鱼。其他许多地区的渔民也即将开始大规模的捕鱼。国家渔业企业的工作人员和集体农庄的渔民的任务是要在巴伦支海、白海、远东和西伯利亚开辟新的捕鱼区。渔业消费合作社非常注意为渔民服务，直接在渔场上供给他们一切必需品和食品。在捕鱼期间，要把食品和各种日用必需品运到捕鱼的地方——渔场、收鱼站和码头上。为此，合作社备有约一千只船。在捕鱼最忙的时候，将有两万名贸易工作者为渔民服务。在里海，已准备好了三百个水上商店，这些商店将定期到捕鱼区去工作。在一只大轮船上将设立一个水上贸易联合公司。这里要开设商店、食堂和为渔民服务的各种福利设备。
