    On the Banks of the Yom River
    By Xinhua Reporter Zhan Chao

    The Yom River (formerly translated as the Mang Thanh River), originating in Lai Châu Province in northwestern Vietnam, winds its way through rugged mountains and narrow valleys, flowing south to north through the heart of the Điện Biên Phủ Mường Thanh plain before flowing into the Nam Ou River in Laos. This river has become the lifeline for the more than 20,000 Thái, Xá, and Mèo people living in Điện Biên Phủ. The Yom River irrigates rice paddies and nourishes various plants.

    The scenery along the Yom River is exceptionally beautiful. Evergreen trees, bamboo groves, and mulberry forests grow on the riverbanks, and herds of livestock graze in the fields on both sides. Even in winter, one can hear birds singing and cicadas chirping, and see flowers of all colors.

    However, the Yom River now presents a different scene: oak trees have been felled, houses have been demolished, and pigs and cattle have been slaughtered! American-made aircraft of all types circle in the sky day and night. These ominous birds either airdrop French invading troops equipped with full American gear and tons of ammunition onto airfields made from vast rice paddies on the banks of the Yom River, or use heavy bombs and napalm bombs to destroy villages and houses in the plains and mountains, turning green land into scorched earth. Along the banks of the Yom River, obstacles made of barbed wire can be seen everywhere, and French fortifications extend in all directions from Mường Thanh as the center. The people living on the banks of the Yom River have been rounded up ever since the French invading troops airdropped into Điện Biên Phủ on November 20, 1953. Under the bayonets, they were forced to tear down the wood from their own houses to build fortifications; young women were raped, men were conscripted into the army, and even children as young as fourteen or fifteen were not spared.

    Hatred fills people's hearts, and they look forward to the arrival of the People's Army day and night.

    At around 4:00 PM on March 13, 1954, the sound of Vietnamese People's Army artillery fire rang out on the banks of the Yom River. The infantry heroes of the Vietnamese People's Army, bearing the hopes for liberation of the various ethnic groups of Vietnam, took action! They quickly attacked Tân Lập, the strong resistance center of the French invading army's Điện Biên Phủ stronghold. The officers and soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Foreign Legion Regiment of the French invading army, trapped there, were either killed, wounded, or captured alive.

    In those messy fortifications, there were cigarette butts, canned food boxes, vulgar photos, and letters sent from various places that had been strictly censored by the French military authorities. Among them was a French letter with messy handwriting and a photo attached. When soldiers of a unit of the Vietnamese People's Army found this letter, they also found two French leaflets issued by the General Political Department of the Vietnamese People's Army placed with the letter.

    This was a letter from a French mother to her son. Judging from the photo, this French mother was about forty years old. In her letter, she said with infinite worry: "...But, my son! There is still one thing that makes me uneasy—why haven't I received a letter from you? Have you been in combat since January 1st? I dare not listen to the radio, because the latest news is very pessimistic! The newspapers don't say anything, not a single word. In my opinion, this is a bad sign: something unfortunate must have happened again!"

    Obviously, this French mother had tried her best to reassure herself. She temporarily put the unfinished letter aside, hoping to hear some news about her son, Leni. Time passed by slowly, and this mother finally couldn't bear it anymore, writing in the same letter with great pain: "...It's been three days, and there's still no news, I'm extremely worried!" But, as a mother, she still held on to a glimmer of hope, and scribbled these words at the end of the letter: "Goodbye, my dear son! I hope to see your letter soon."

    This letter, written by the mother living in the Diry region of France to her son, was sent on February 22, 1954. Probably, when this letter traveled across the ocean and just arrived at the banks of the Yom River in northwestern Vietnam, the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Foreign Legion Regiment of the French invading army to which her son belonged had been completely annihilated under the pounding of the Vietnamese People's Army.

    The extremely painful feelings revealed in the letter from this French mother reflect the same feelings of many French women whose sons and husbands have been driven to Vietnam to die. They do not want their loved ones to serve for the "dirty war." The Vietnamese people are fighting to restore peace and tranquility to the Yom River basin and the whole of Vietnam, and their struggle is in line with the wishes of the good people of France.

    约姆河畔
    新华社记者　展潮
    约姆河（前译芒清河），这条发源在越南西北莱州省境内的河流，蜿蜒曲折地冲出了重山狭谷，自南而北从奠边府芒清平原的中心穿过，流到寮国的南乌江去。这条河流，成为居住奠边府两万多泰族、舍族和苗族人民的生活中心。约姆河用它的水灌溉稻田，并滋润着各种植物。
    约姆河畔的风光是十分美好的。河岸上生长着各种常绿树、竹丛和桑林，两边的田野里牧放着成群的牲畜。即使是冬天，也可以听到鸟语蝉鸣，看到各色鲜花。
    可是，现在约姆河畔却呈现出另外一种景象：橡木被砍伐了，房舍被拆毁了，猪牛被宰杀了！美国制的各式飞机，不分日夜在空中盘旋。这些不祥之鸟，不是把全副美国装备的法国侵略军和成吨的弹药空投到约姆河畔大片稻田填成的飞机场上，就是用重磅炸弹和凝固汽油弹去摧毁平原和山地上的村舍，使一片片绿色的土地变成焦黑。约姆河两岸，随处可以看到用铁丝网构成的障碍，法军的碉堡以芒清为中心向四处延伸。居住在约姆河畔的人民，从一九五三年十一月二十日法国侵略军空降奠边府后，就统统被集中起来，在刺刀的逼迫下拆下自己房子的木料去修工事；青年妇女遭到蹂躏，男人被抓去当兵，甚至连十四、五岁的小孩也不能幸免。
    仇恨充满着人们的心，他们日夜盼望人民军的到来。
    一九五四年三月十三日下午四点多钟，约姆河畔响起了越南人民军的炮声。背负着越南各族人民的解放愿望的越南人民军步兵英雄们行动了！他们迅速地攻进了法国侵略军奠边府集团据点强固的抵抗中心新兰。困守在那里的法国侵略军外籍军团第十三旅第三营的官兵，不是被打死、打伤，就是被活捉了。
    在那些狼藉不堪的工事里，到处都是纸烟头、罐头盒、下流的照片以及从各处寄来已经受过法军当局严格检查了的书信。在这里面有一封字迹潦草并夹着一张照片的法文信。越南人民军某部战士捡到这封信的时候，还发现有两张越南人民军总政治部印发的法文传单和信放在一起。
    这是一位法国母亲写给她儿子的信。从照片上看，这位法国母亲大约有四十多岁。她在信中无限忧虑地说：“……但是，我的儿子！还有一件事情使我不安的——为什么没有你的来信呢？自一月一日到现在，你是否还处在战斗的环境中呢？我不敢听广播，因为最近的消息都是很悲观的！报纸上没有讲到什么，一点也没有讲到。据我看来，这是一个不好的征兆：一定又有什么不幸的事情发生了！”
    显然，这位法国母亲曾经极力安定过自己。她把没有写完的信暂时放在身边，企图能够听到一些关于她儿子勒尼的消息。时间是这样艰难地一点一点地挨过去，这位母亲终于忍受不住了，在同一封信里痛苦万分地写道：“……已经是第三天了，还没有什么消息，我心里愁闷极了！”但是，作为母亲的她，最后还是抱着一线希望，在信的末尾又潦草地写下这几个字：“再见，我亲爱的儿子！希望很快地看到你的信。”
    这位居住在法国迪瑞地方的母亲写给她儿子的信，是一九五四年二月二十二日发出的。大概这封信远渡重洋刚刚转到越南西北的约姆河畔时，她儿子所属的法国侵略军外籍军团第十三旅第三营，就在越南人民军的捶击下全部覆没了。
    这位法国母亲的信所流露出的非常痛苦的心情，反映出许多有儿子、丈夫被驱赶到越南送死的法国妇女的同样心情，她们不愿意自己的亲人为进行“肮脏的战争”而卖命。越南人民正在为恢复约姆河流域和整个越南的和平与安宁而奋斗，他们的斗争是与法国的善良人民的心愿一致的。
