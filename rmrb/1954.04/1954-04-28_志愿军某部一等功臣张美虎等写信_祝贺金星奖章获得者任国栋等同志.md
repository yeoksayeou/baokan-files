First-Class Merit Citation Recipients Zhang Meihu and Others of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers Send a Letter to Congratulate Comrades Ren Guodong and Others, Recipients of the Gold Star Medal

Dear Comrades Ren Guodong, Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, recipients of the Gold Star Medal:

When we read in the newspapers from the motherland that you had received the Gold Star Medal, we felt the same way that we did when the representatives of the Korean people pinned the "National Flag Medal" and "Soldier's Honor Medal" on our chests, and we were happy for you and congratulated you. We cut out your pictures from the newspaper and placed them together with our pictures taken under the national flag when we received our merit citations. You are working hard for the socialist construction of the motherland; we are guarding the 38th parallel with guns in hand for the socialist construction of the motherland. Although we are far apart, we are doing two different jobs under the same goal.

When we talked about your names with our comrades-in-arms, we learned many stories about you. When we heard these stories, a thriving rural motherland appeared in our minds, and at the same time, we saw her bright future. Dear comrades! It is this force that enabled us not to feel bitter during the period of one mouthful of fried flour and one mouthful of snow, and not to feel cold when wading through icy rivers in seasons of minus 40 degrees; it is this force that supported us in defeating the American aggressors' attack and winning the victory of the Korean armistice; it is this force that enables us to vigilantly guard the 38th parallel in the severe winter with snow and wind and in the pouring rain at night. Dear comrades! Let us, under the brilliant light of the general line, create greater happiness for our children and grandchildren. We swear to you and the people of the whole country: "We will forever hold our guns tightly to defend the happy life of the people of the motherland and the cause of world peace." We wish you greater achievements in agricultural production.

First-Class Merit Citation Recipients of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

	Zhang Meihu	Li Wenxue	Zhu Xueli
	Zhao Wenhe	Zhang Dunlan	Fang Dingkun

    志愿军某部一等功臣张美虎等写信
    祝贺金星奖章获得者任国栋等同志亲爱的金星奖章获得者任国栋、李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安同志：
    当我们从祖国的报纸上看到你们获得了金星奖章的消息后，我们怀着像朝鲜人民的代表把“国旗勋章”、“战士荣誉勋章”佩戴在我们胸前时一样的心情，为你们高兴和祝贺。我们从报纸上把你们的像片剪下来，把它同我们立功时在国旗下照的像片放在一起，你们为了祖国的社会主义建设，在辛勤地劳动着；我们为着祖国社会主义建设，握枪守卫在三八线上。虽然我们距离是这样遥远，但我们是在一个目标下做着两样不同的工作。
    当我们同战友们谈到你们的名字时，我们知道你们的许多故事，当我们听到这些故事时，就在我们的心目中浮现出了欣欣向荣的祖国农村，同时也就望见了她的美好的未来。亲爱的同志们！就是这种力量，曾使我们在一口炒面一口雪的时期不感到苦、在零下四十度的季节里淌冰河而不觉得冷；就是这种力量，支持着我们打败了美国侵略者进攻，获得朝鲜停战的胜利；就是这种力量，使我们在风雪交加的严冬，在大雨滂沱的夜里，警惕地守卫在三八线上。亲爱的同志们！让我们在总路线光辉的照耀下，为我们的子孙万代创造更大的幸福。我们向你们及全国人民宣誓：“我们要永远地握紧枪杆捍卫着祖国人民的幸福生活和世界的和平事业。”祝你们在农业生产中获得更大的成绩。
    志愿军某部一等功臣：
    张美虎　李文学　朱学礼
    赵文和　张敦岚　方定坤
