Eastern Inner Mongolia is promoting large quantities of new agricultural tools and pesticides this year to help farmers increase grain production and support national construction. This includes 27 sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements, 400 waterwheels, 3,425 walking plows, 5,000 shovel cultivators, and 840 weeding hoes; pesticides include more than 36,200 jin of "Ceresan" and more than 10,000 jin of "666" powder. These agricultural tools and pesticides have been allocated to various banners and counties.

Last year, with the help of local agricultural technology extension stations, the eastern region promoted a large number of new agricultural tools and improved technology, increasing grain production. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin used a horse-drawn seeder to broadcast 30 hectares of wheat, which achieved an overall bumper harvest, with yields about 50 percent higher than the wheat sown by local farmers using old agricultural tools. According to calculations based on 160 shovel cultivators within the guidance range of various agricultural technology extension stations, each shovel cultivator cultivated an average of 24.5 hectares of crops. The more than 2,100 shovel cultivators loaned to farmers solved the difficulties of frequent rainfall, even growth of weeds and seedlings, and insufficient labor during summer hoeing.

In order to further improve farmers' cultivation techniques and increase grain production, the eastern region has added 11 extension stations (including 3 league stations) to the original 11 agricultural technology extension stations this year. These technology extension stations have formulated work plans to assist farmers in agricultural technology guidance. Each guidance station will train two to three people who can master the installation, use, maintenance, and repair of horse-drawn agricultural implements in key cooperatives promoting horse-drawn tools; at the same time, the extension stations will hold short-term training classes to teach farmers how to use walking plows, shovel cultivators, weeding hoes, and other agricultural tools.

    内蒙古东部区推广大批新式农具和农药
    内蒙古东部区今年推广大批新式农具和农药，帮助农民增产粮食，支援国家建设。推广的有马拉农具二十七套、水车四百台、步犁三千四百二十五台、铲趟机五千台、耘锄八百四十台；农药有“赛力散”三万六千二百多斤，“六六六”药粉一万多斤。这些农具和农药已调拨到各旗、县。
    去年，东部区在当地农业技术推广站的帮助下，推广了大批的新农具，改进了技术，增产了粮食。科尔沁左翼中旗前进农业生产合作社，用马拉播种机平播的三十公顷小麦，全面获得丰收，产量比当地农民用旧农具播种的小麦，高出百分之五十左右。仅据各地农业技术推广站指导范围内的一百六十台铲趟机计算，平均每台铲趟机铲趟二十四点五公顷庄稼。贷给农民的二千一百多台铲趟机，在夏锄中，解决了雨水勤、草苗齐长和劳力不足的困难。
    为了进一步提高农民的耕作技术，增产更多的粮食，东部区今年在原有十一个农业技术推广站的基础上，又增设了十一处推广站（其中有盟站三处）。这些技术推广站，已订出帮助农民进行农业技术指导的作业计划，各地指导站，将在马拉农具推广的重点社内，培养出能掌握安装、使用、保管和修理的人员两名到三名；同时推广站要举办短期训练班，传授给农民使用步犁、铲趟机、耘锄等农具的方法。
