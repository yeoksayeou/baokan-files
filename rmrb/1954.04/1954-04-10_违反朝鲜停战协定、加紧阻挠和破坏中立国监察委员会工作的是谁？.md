(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 8th) Special correspondent report: The US side has recently been wantonly slandering the Korean-Chinese side for violating the armistice agreement, and is stepping up its obstruction and sabotage of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, harboring ulterior motives.

In a speech delivered in New York on March 29th, US Secretary of State Dulles slandered the Korean-Chinese side for violating the armistice agreement and not allowing the Swedish and Swiss representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "full opportunity to supervise" the implementation of the armistice agreement in North Korea. Subsequently, the American propaganda machine was ordered to fabricate rumors, slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "restricting" the work of the Swedish and Swiss representatives in North Korea, claiming that these representatives "are unwilling to continue working in the commission." This action by Dulles and his ilk is clearly part of their recently launched propaganda campaign aimed at opposing peaceful consultations and creating a tense atmosphere.

However, the tricks of Dulles and his ilk to distort the facts and make false accusations are futile. The reports, records, and other documents of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission all show that it is not the Korean-Chinese side that is violating the armistice agreement and obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but the US side itself. In order to cover up its illegal acts of violating the armistice agreement, the US side has been trying its best to obstruct and interfere with the work of the neutral nations inspection teams stationed at various ports in South Korea by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The US side refused to open boxes containing military supplies at various ports in South Korea and refused to allow neutral personnel to board ships for inspection. On January 20th and 21st of this year, the US side even prohibited neutral personnel from entering Incheon Port for inspection. The US side openly hijacked, beat, insulted, and intimidated personnel of the neutral nations inspection teams. The US side hijacked Polish personnel Hado Kiewicz at Kangneung Airport on September 9th of last year. The auxiliary personnel provided by the US side also beat Captain Larsson, a Swedish officer of the Daegu team.

In order to transport a large number of reinforcing military personnel and war materials into South Korea to arm the Syngman Rhee puppet army and enhance its military strength, the US side has been using concealment and deception to make it impossible for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to carry out its task of supervising the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials as stipulated in the armistice agreement. The US side does not report or underreports the war materials shipped in to the neutral nations inspection teams. Only after the neutral nations inspection teams discovered certain unreported or underreported materials did the US side submit "reports" and "supplementary reports" that were obviously fabricated based on the figures found by the teams. For example, the Busan neutral nations inspection team inspected and found that the US side had transported in 40,000 pounds of bombs on January 19th of this year, but the US side only submitted a "supplementary report" nine days later, and insisted that the same amount of bombs had been "destroyed" on the same day they were transported in.

The US side also disassembles a large amount of war materials into parts and components and transports them into South Korea under the guise of parts and components, and refuses to submit reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Based solely on the report materials of the neutral nations inspection teams in South Korea, from the armistice to the end of January this year, the US side transported in at least enough gun barrels and breech mechanisms to assemble 149 105mm and 155mm howitzers, and 57 155mm cannons. The United States also violated the armistice agreement's provisions regarding the replacement of combat aircraft "on a one-for-one basis with aircraft of the same performance and type," overshipped ten types of combat aircraft, and refused to report the subtypes of combat aircraft that were replacements in order to ship in new types of combat aircraft.

In addition, the US side has been constantly creating air and ground violations of the armistice agreement. US military aircraft openly flew in formation over the headquarters area of the Military Armistice Commission and Kaesong, where the Korean-Chinese armistice delegation is located, and even intruded into our rear areas, such as the mouth of the Chongchon River, about 50 kilometers north of Pyongyang. The US side also sent armed personnel to invade our area for armed attacks and espionage activities. From the armistice to March 26th of this year, the US side's military aircraft intruded into our area and over the coastal airspace a total of 232 times as reported by our side, opened fire on our demilitarized zone 6 times as reported by our side, and US military personnel invaded our area for hostile acts 11 times as reported by our side.

More seriously, the US side violated the armistice agreement, using terrorist means to deprive Korean-Chinese prisoners of war of their freedom and right to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, and forcibly abducted them from the POW camps under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, transferring them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to serve as cannon fodder. The US side also violated the armistice agreement regarding the repatriation of displaced civilians, using terrorist means to forcibly detain a large number of our displaced civilians who were willing to return home.

In contrast, the Korean-Chinese side has consistently strictly abided by and earnestly implemented the provisions of the armistice agreement related to ensuring the stability of the military armistice. The rotation and replacement work of the Korean-Chinese side is carried out under the inspection and supervision of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. A comment submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on November 10th of last year regarding the rotation and replacement of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out: "The figures reported by that side are the same as those reported by the neutral nations inspection teams and are within the limits stipulated in the armistice agreement." The comment also pointed out: "That side did not report the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, and ammunition, and the neutral nations inspection teams did not observe any replacement." The Korean-Chinese side has always been very respectful of the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and has provided them with full convenience. In September of last year, the neutral nations inspection teams stationed in Sinuiju, Hungnam, and Chongjin all wrote letters thanking the Korean-Chinese side for the convenience and respect they had been given in their work. The letter of thanks from the team stationed in Chongjin was written at the suggestion of Swiss member Major Bieri.

From the above-mentioned diametrically opposed attitudes of the Korean-Chinese side and the US side towards the armistice agreement, it is very clear who is violating the armistice agreement and obstructing and interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in every possible way. The US side's recent wanton slander of the Korean-Chinese side for violating the armistice agreement and "restricting" the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a new step in its consistent policy of maintaining tension in Asia and the world. Its purpose is obviously to attempt to negate the role of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and further abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, so that it can violate the armistice agreement more freely, maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, and thereby obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The world should pay serious attention to this new conspiracy of the US side.

### 违反朝鲜停战协定、加紧阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会工作的是谁？

    违反朝鲜停战协定、加紧阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会工作的是谁？
      【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者报道：美方最近大肆诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，并且加紧阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会的工作，包藏着不可告人的阴谋。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月二十九日在纽约发表的演说中诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，并且不让中立国监察委员的瑞典代表和瑞士代表“有充分的机会来监督”停战协定在北朝鲜的实施。接着，美国宣传机器就奉命大造谣言，诬蔑朝中方面“限制”瑞典和瑞士代表在北朝鲜的工作，说什么这些代表
  “不愿意再在委员会中工作下去”。杜勒斯之流这个行动，显然是他们在最近发动的旨在反对和平协商、制造紧张空气的宣传运动的一部分。
    但是，杜勒斯之流的颠倒黑白、含血喷人的伎俩是徒然的。中立国监察委员会的报告、记录和其他文件都表明：违反停战协定，并且阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作的不是朝中方面，正是美方自己。美方为了掩盖违反停战协定的非法行为，一直竭力对中立国监察委员会驻在南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组的工作加以阻挠和干涉。美方在南朝鲜各口岸拒绝打开装有军事物资的箱子，并且拒绝让中立国人员上船进行视察。在今年一月二十日和二十一日，美方甚至禁止中立国人员进入仁川港口进行视察。美方公然劫持、殴打、侮辱和恫吓中立国视察小组的人员。美方在去年九月九日在江陵机场劫持波兰人员哈都克耶维赤。美方所提供的附属人员还殴打大邱小组的瑞典人员拉尔逊上尉。
    为了把大批增援性的军事人员和作战物资运入南朝鲜，以武装李承晚伪军和增强军事力量，美方一直用隐瞒和欺骗的办法，使得中立国监察委员会无法执行停战协定所规定的监督军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换的任务。美方不向中立国视察小组报告或者少报运入的作战物资。只是在中立国视察小组发现了某些没有报告或者少报的物资以后，美方才提出显然是根据小组查出的数字编造的“报告”和“补充报告”。例如，釜山中立国视察小组在今年一月十九日视察到美方运入了四万磅炸弹，但是美方在九天以后才提出了“补充报告”，并且硬说在运入炸弹的同一天“毁坏”了同样数量的炸弹。
    美方还以零件和拆散件为名，把大量的作战物资拆散后运入南朝鲜，并且拒绝向中立国监察委员会提出报告。仅根据在南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组的报告材料，自停战以后到今年一月底止，美方运入的炮筒和后座机械，至少可以装配成一百四十九门一零五公厘和一五五公厘的榴弹炮，及五十七门一五五公厘的大炮。美国还违反停战协定关于作战飞机“在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换”的规定，超额运入十种类型的作战飞机，并且拒不报告属于替换的作战飞机的副型，以便运入新型的作战飞机。
    此外，美方还不断地制造空中和地面违反停战协定的事件。美方军用飞机公然编队飞越军事停战委员会总部区和朝中停战代表团所在地开城，甚至侵入平壤以北约五十公里的清川江口等我方后方地区。美方还派遣武装人员侵入我方地区进行武装袭击和特务活动。自停战以来到今年三月二十六日止，美方军用飞机侵入我方地区及沿海上空，已经我方提出的共达二百三十二次，对我方非军事区进行枪炮射击已经我方提出的六次，美方军事人员侵入我方地区进行敌对行为已经我方提出的十一次。
    更加严重的是，美方违反停战协定，用恐怖手段剥夺朝中战俘听取解释和申请遣返的自由和权利，并且用武力把他们从中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营里劫走，把他们移交给李蒋匪帮充当炮灰。美方还违反停战协定协助失所平民返乡的规定，用恐怖手段强迫扣留大批愿意返乡的我方失所平民。
    与此相反，朝中方面一贯严格遵守并切实执行停战协定中有关保证军事停战稳定的条款。朝中方面的轮换和替换工作，是在中立国监察委员会的视察与监督之下进行的。中立国监察委员会在去年十一月十日提出的关于朝中方面轮换和替换的评论指出：“该方所报告的数字与各中立国视察小组所报告的数字相同，并在停战协定所规定的限额以内。”评论还指出：“该方并未报告作战飞机、装甲车辆与弹药的替换，而各中立国视察小组亦未观察到有替换的情况。”朝中方面对中立国监察委员会的工作一贯十分尊重，并且给予他们充分的便利。去年九月间，驻新义州、兴南和清津的中立国视察小组都写信感谢朝中方面给予他们的工作上的便利和尊重。驻清津的小组的感谢信还是在瑞士组员比埃里少校的提议下写成的。
    从上述的朝中方面和美方对待停战协定的截然相反的态度看来，是谁违反停战协定，并且对中立国监察委员会的工作多方加以阻挠和干涉，就非常明显。美方最近大肆诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，并且“限制”中立国监察委员会的工作是它保持亚洲和世界紧张局势的一贯政策的新的步骤。其目的，显然在于企图否定中立国监察委员会的作用，进而取消中立国监察委员会，以便它更加放手地违反停战协定，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，借以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。对美方这个新的阴谋，全世界应引起严重注意。
