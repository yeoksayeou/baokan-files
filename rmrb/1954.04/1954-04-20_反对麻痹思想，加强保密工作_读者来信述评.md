    Oppose Complacency, Strengthen Confidentiality Work
    —Reader Letters and Commentary
    Mu Yang
    According to reader letters from various regions, strengthening confidentiality education for government and state personnel and improving confidentiality systems are issues that still require attention. Due to the lack of consistent confidentiality education and robust confidentiality systems in some agencies, incidents of secrecy breaches and leaks have occurred.
    Some agency personnel fail to distinguish between classified and unclassified information, carelessly leaving internal materials and transmitting internal documents. Li Dinghe from the Yongxing County People's Government Grain Bureau in Hunan Province wrote that their bureau's conference room door is often left open and unattended, with many people going in and out. However, many internal publications are left on the table, and as a result, many have gone missing. Yu Tieying from the Liaoxi Provincial Public Security Department wrote that in March of this year, while shopping in front of Hankou Railway Station in Wuhan, he discovered that merchants were using packaging paper that was the 1953 work inspection report from the Central South trade departments. Last year, the Jinan Railway Bureau also sold a batch of internal confidential materials mixed in with waste paper. In addition, some district and township governments in certain areas are even having criminals sentenced to labor reform, those under surveillance, or landlords deliver official documents or even draft internal documents. Some leaks have occurred in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, as a result.
    Some state personnel arbitrarily discuss internal confidential matters in public places. For example, reader Chen Buxiang revealed that at the beginning of this year, a comrade from the Linxia City People's Government Public Security Bureau actually used a public telephone at the Linxia Post and Telecommunications Bureau, in front of many people, to make a public security call to the Lanzhou City People's Government Public Security Bureau. Several readers reported that some young comrades who recently started working, in order to boast about the importance of their work and the "breadth" of their knowledge, casually exaggerate when interacting with relatives and friends. Reader Fan Lisheng wrote that once, while taking a train from Beijing to Changchun, he encountered several state personnel on the train discussing the situation of certain factories that they knew about as if no one else was around.
    Some cadres also have various misconceptions about confidentiality: some believe that our country has entered a period of economic construction, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has been victorious, and the domestic counter-revolutionary remnants have "fallen silent," so confidentiality work is not as important as it used to be. Some believe that "confidentiality work is the responsibility of the confidentiality committee" and that "ordinary staff have no secrets to keep." Obviously, losing revolutionary vigilance and disarming oneself ideologically is very harmful. Many historical facts have taught us that when the enemy's frontal, overt sabotage activities suffer defeat, they will inevitably resort to covert, secret methods to carry out sabotage activities. The greater the achievements of our construction endeavors, the more frantic the enemy's activities will become. The communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: China is now in a stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation, and this revolution involves extremely complex and acute struggles. Foreign imperialists and domestic resolute counter-revolutionaries will inevitably
    "collude with each other and take advantage of every opportunity to sabotage the cause of our Party and the people, attempting to make the Chinese revolution fail and restore reactionary rule in China." Any complacency and carelessness on our part in confidentiality work will provide the enemy with an opportunity for sabotage and may damage our construction endeavors.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the country's construction endeavors, all complacent thoughts must be corrected, and all phenomena of secrecy breaches and leaks must be prevented. Leaders at all levels of government must strengthen their attention to and leadership of confidentiality work, and regularly conduct ideological education among staff on keeping state secrets, so that they recognize the important political significance of this work and consciously abide by confidentiality discipline and develop good confidentiality habits. Secondly, they should develop a set of confidentiality systems that are suited to the actual needs of their respective units, so that staff clearly understand the boundaries and scope of secrets and have something to follow in their actions. Finally, confidentiality inspections should also be conducted regularly and systematically to ensure the implementation of confidentiality systems, promptly identify loopholes, and close them. In addition, serious and conscientious handling of certain serious leaks and secrecy breaches is necessary in order to achieve the goal of educating everyone.

    反对麻痹思想，加强保密工作
    ——读者来信述评
    穆扬
    根据各地读者来信反映：加强对机关和国家工作人员的保密教育和健全保密制度，仍然是当前必须提起注意的问题。由于某些机关缺乏经常的保密教育和健全的保密制度，已经发生了一些失密和泄密的事件。
    有些机关人员平密不分，随便放置内部材料和传送内部文件。湖南省永兴县人民政府粮食局李定何同志来信说：他们局的会议室门经常开着没人管，进出的人很多，但是桌子上却放着很多内部刊物，结果，有很多就找不到了。辽西省公安厅余铁鹰来信说，今年三月间，他在武汉市汉口车站前买东西，发现商人用的包货纸都是中南贸易部门一九五三年的工作检查报告。济南铁路局在去年也曾把一批内部机密材料夹在废纸堆里出卖了。此外，还有某些地方的区乡政府竟让被判处劳动改造的罪犯、被管制分子或地主送递公文甚至缮写内部文件；四川省富顺县就曾因此而发生过一些泄密事件。
    某些国家工作人员在公共场所任意谈论内部机密情况。如读者陈步湘揭发：今年年初，临夏市人民政府公安局的一位同志竟在临夏邮电局当着很多人用公用电话给兰州市人民政府公安局通公安电话。有几个读者反映：某些新参加工作的青年同志，在同亲友们接触时，为了夸耀自己工作的重要性和知识的“广泛”，就随便夸夸其谈。读者范蠡生来信：某次他从北京乘火车去长春时，曾遇到几个国家工作人员在车上旁若无人地谈论自己知道的某些工厂的情况。
    有些干部对于保密问题还有着各种错误的认识：有人以为我们国家已经进入经济建设时期，抗美援朝已经胜利，国内反革命残余已经“歛声匿迹”了，保密工作不像过去那样重要了。有人认为“保密工作是保密委员会的事”，“一般工作人员无密可保”。显然，失掉革命警惕、在思想上解除武装是十分有害的。许多历史事实教训我们：当敌人正面的、公开的破坏活动遭受失败时，就必然会采取隐蔽的、秘密的方式来进行破坏活动。我们建设事业的成就愈大，敌人的活动也就愈疯狂。中国共产党第七届中央委员会第四次全体会议的公报中曾指出：现在中国正处在社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段，在这个革命中包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。外国帝国主义和国内的坚决反革命分子必然会
  “互相勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟”。而我们在保密工作方面的任何麻痹大意，都是敌人破坏活动的可乘之机，可能使我们的建设事业受到损害。
    为了保证国家建设事业顺利地进行，一切麻痹大意的思想必须纠正，一切失密、泄密现象必须防止。各级机关的领导方面必须加强对保密工作的重视和领导，经常地向工作人员进行保守国家机密的思想教育，使他们认识这项工作的重要政治意义，从而自觉地遵守保密纪律，养成保密的良好习惯；其次，应该根据本单位的具体情况，制订一套切合实际需要的保密制度，使工作人员明确地知道机密的界限和范围，在行动中有所遵循；最后，还应该经常地、有计划地进行保密检查工作，保证保密制度的贯彻实施，及时发现漏洞，加以堵塞；此外，对于某些严重的泄密、失密事件，必须进行严肃认真的处理，以达到教育大家的目的。
