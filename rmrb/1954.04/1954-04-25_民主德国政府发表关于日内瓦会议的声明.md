Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 24th: The Press Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the German Democratic Republic held a press conference on the morning of the 23rd, and issued a statement by the Government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the Geneva Conference.

    In the statement, the Government of the German Democratic Republic first, on behalf of all peace-loving German people, welcomed the convening of the Geneva Conference. The statement said: We, the German people, sincerely hope that achievements can be made at the Geneva Conference in a spirit of understanding, achievements that will promote the further relaxation of the international situation, thereby helping to maintain and consolidate world peace.

    We hope with brotherly concern that the heroic Korean people will finally be able to obtain lasting peace, democratic unification, and complete freedom and independence of their homeland.

    Together with all peace-loving people, we expect the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the vital rights of the people of Indochina.

    A particularly favorable prerequisite for the success of the Geneva Conference is the participation of the People's Republic of China, which allows the five major powers to meet and consult for the first time; the invitation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the conference will guarantee its cooperation in the negotiation of the Korean issue.

    The statement said: The German people feel that their national interests are closely related to this conference. There is no doubt that a further relaxation of international relations will ease the tensions in Europe caused by the signing of the Bonn and Paris Treaties and will make a peaceful solution to the German problem easier.

    The statement said: The restoration of peace in Indochina will relieve the anxieties of thousands of German mothers. Their sons, with the consent of the Adenauer government, are shedding blood in Indochina as soldiers of the (French) Foreign Legion.

    The statement concluded: The Government of the German Democratic Republic demands that the Geneva Conference make a resolution to repatriate all Germans in the Foreign Legion to their home country. The government reiterates its readiness to give those Germans returning from the Foreign Legion – no matter which part of Germany they are from – the possibility of engaging in peaceful labor as citizens enjoying equal rights.

    民主德国政府发表关于日内瓦会议的声明
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】德意志民主共和国政府外交部新闻司于二十三日上午举行记者招待会，发表了德意志民主共和国政府关于日内瓦会议的声明。
    德意志民主共和国政府在声明中首先代表全体爱好和平的德国人民欢迎日内瓦会议的召开。声明说：我们德国人民诚挚地希望在日内瓦会议上能在谅解的精神下得到成就，这些成就将促进国际局势的进一步缓和，从而有助于保持和巩固世界和平。
    我们以兄弟般的关切心情希望英勇的朝鲜人民终于能够获得持久的和平、民主的统一以及祖国的完全自由和独立。
    我们和所有爱好和平的人们一起，期望日内瓦会议能在尊重印度支那人民切身权利的基础上，对重新恢复印度支那的和平达成协议。
    日内瓦会议能够获得成就的特别有利的先决条件，是由于有中华人民共和国的参加，而使五大国得以第一次聚会协商；由于邀请了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加会议，在谈判朝鲜问题时，将保证能获得它的合作。
    声明说：德国人民感觉到自己的民族利益和这个会议密切相关。毫无疑问，国际关系的进一步缓和将会减轻由于签订波恩和巴黎条约而在欧洲引起的紧张局势，并将使德国问题的和平解决比较容易。
    声明说：重新恢复印度支那的和平，将解除成千上万的德国母亲们的忧虑。她们的儿子在阿登纳政府的同意下作为（法国）外籍军团士兵正在印度支那流血。
    声明最后说：德意志民主共和国政府要求日内瓦会议作出决议，把外籍军团中所有的德国人遣返回国。政府再度声明，准备给那些从外籍军团回来的德国人——不论他们是德国那一部分的人——以作为享有平等权利的公民而从事和平劳动的可能性。
