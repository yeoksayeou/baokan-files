Do a Good Job in Forest Fire Prevention Centered on Spring Farming Production
—Reader's Letters and Commentary
Xiao Ying

In spring, mountain forests are prone to fires. Some farmers in certain regions, due to the busyness of agricultural production, neglect forest fire prevention, leading to frequent forest fires and causing undue losses to the country's valuable forest resources. We have recently received many readers' letters reflecting this situation. For example, in two recent mountain fires in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, 800 mu of mountain forests and 250,000 pine trees were burned. Since the beginning of spring, 55 mountain fires have occurred continuously in 36 counties including Fenyang, Jincheng, Mengxian, Qixian, and Yuanqu in Shanxi Province, burning more than 1,200 mu of mountain forests. In Hebei Province, where there are very few trees, six mountain fires also occurred in Chengde, Luanping, and Aohan counties/banners from late January to early February. Similar incidents have also occurred in Hubei, Jiangxi, Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces.

Judging from the letters, most of these fires were caused by the carelessness of individuals. For example, the two mountain fires in Lianyuan County were caused once by a farmer burning thatch next to his house, with the fire spreading to the mountain forest due to strong winds; and another time by a farmer who did not extinguish the remaining fire after "burning the field ridges." A farmer in Ezipo Township, Sangzhi County, Hunan Province, also carelessly caused a mountain fire on Xijie Mountain while burning ash for fertilizer, but fortunately it was rescued before it became a major disaster. The lack of attention to forest fire prevention work by some district and township cadres has further increased the losses caused by mountain fires. For example, Liu Haitang, a district cadre in Anren County, Hunan Province, was in charge of production in Baolian Township. When a mountain fire occurred in the township on February 10th, he said, "Burning barren hills doesn't matter." As a result, the fire spread and more than 2,000 mu of forest were burned. Therefore, if the leading organs in all mountain forest areas can conduct publicity on fire prevention and forest protection while leading spring farming production, and educate cadres and farmers to be vigilant, forest fires can be reduced or avoided.

In order to prevent forest fires, first, district, township cadres, and the masses of farmers should be made aware of the important significance of fire prevention and forest protection. They should be told that timber is an indispensable material in national construction, and that China's existing timber resources are not excessive, but insufficient. To supply the timber needed for national construction, in addition to actively afforesting and cultivating forests, we must also protect existing forests from loss. The losses caused by mountain fires are enormous. According to Hebei Province's statistics for 1953, the trees burned by mountain fires throughout the province, if allowed to grow for another four years, could supply purlins for building more than 36,000 houses. In a certain district of Xinping County, Yunnan Province, the timber burned by mountain fires in just over a year was worth more than 2 million catties of rice. They should also be told that forests can regulate the climate, prevent disasters of water, drought, wind, and sand, and protect the harvest of crops. For example, in the sandy waste area of eastern Henan, farmland often had to be sown two or three times to ensure seedling emergence due to wind and sand disasters in the past, and land that originally yielded two seasons could only harvest one season of autumn crops. Since liberation, due to the gradual planting of sand-break forests, Tucheng Village in the suburbs of Kaifeng, which had no wheat fields in the past, planted 3,200 mu of wheat in 1953, and the yield has increased year by year. The sandy waste area as a whole has also gradually decreased, expanding the cultivated area by 150,000 mu in just four years. If the leading organs in various mountain forest areas can use concrete and vivid examples from the local area to publicize to cadres and farmers, so that they can more deeply understand the importance of protecting forests to national economic construction and the good role it plays in their own production, they will consciously and actively carry out forest fire prevention work.

Secondly, the organizational work should be strengthened on the basis of the masses' awareness to implement effective methods to eliminate fire sources. For example, in late autumn last year, the Liuan Special District in Anhui Province promptly strengthened publicity on forest fire prevention in response to the farmers' habit of burning grass for fertilizer and burning radish fields, and organized the masses to make fire prevention preparations in advance, so that mountain fire incidents in the special district gradually decreased, and at the same time promoted mass production. Sichuan Province advocates using grass cutting for fertilizer to change the habit of farmers in the province to burn grass for fertilizer; when farmers need ash fertilizer, it is advocated to organize together to burn it in windless weather and in open spaces far away from woodland; in ethnic minority areas, it is advocated to refine farming methods to change the backward production method of "slash-and-burn cultivation"; burning for cultivation is generally prohibited; but when farmers urgently need to expand the cultivated area, they must report to the district and township people's governments for approval, and conduct it only after strict organization and making various fire prevention preparations. According to local experience, this practice of organizing the masses to prevent fire sources is very effective.

During the spring farming season, various mountain forest areas should carry out forest fire prevention work around the agricultural activities of spring farming production. As long as forest fire prevention work can be closely integrated with production activities, forest protection work can be done well, and spring farming production will definitely not be affected. For example, in many areas, farmers have to "burn field ridges" in spring farming to eliminate weeds on the field ridges, reduce pests, and use grass ash as fertilizer. If all localities can mobilize farmers to carry out this work in an organized manner, it can not only prevent mountain fires, but also avoid the situation of some burning while others do not when carried out in a decentralized manner, and more effectively prevent pests. For another example, in some areas, farmers have to enter the mountains to collect firewood and cut grass for fertilizer in the spring, and smoking and baking dry food in the mountains are very likely to cause fires. If cooperative societies and mutual aid groups can set an example, mobilize everyone to enter the mountains together, or further organize farmers for temporary mutual aid and labor exchange, it can not only save a lot of manpower for spring farming production, but also play a role in mutual supervision and fire prevention.

In addition, for areas with abundant forest resources or frequent mountain fires, the local leading organs must pay special attention to it and vigorously carry out forest fire prevention work. Recently, Hubei Province established a forest fire prevention headquarters composed of the Provincial People's Government, the Military Region Command, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of Public Security, the People's Supervisory Committee, and the People's Court, and sent five groups to areas with frequent mountain fires to conduct inspections, handle accumulated cases of forest fires, punish those responsible for causing fires according to law, and reward those who have achieved results in fire prevention. This series of work has promoted the subordinate governments at all levels to combine forest fire prevention work when leading production, and expanded the effect of publicity and education work on forest fire prevention, which is worthy of learning from all localities.

    围绕春耕生产做好护林防火工作
    ——读者来信述评
    萧颖
    春季，山林很容易发生火灾。有些地区的农民因为农事生产繁忙，就忽略了护林防火，因此山林火灾事件时有发生，使国家宝贵的森林资源受到了不应有的损失。我们最近接到不少读者来信反映了这方面的情况。如湖南省涟源县在最近两次的山火中就烧毁山林八百亩，松树二十五万株。山西汾阳、晋城、盂县、祁县、垣曲等三十六个县入春以来连续发生山火五十五次，烧毁山林一千二百多亩。林木很少的热河省，一月下旬到二月上旬也在承德、滦平、敖汉等县、旗发生山火六次。湖北、江西、山东、安徽、四川、云南等省也有类似事件。
    从来信中看，这些火灾大部是由于个别人的疏忽大意而引起的。像涟源县的两次山火，一次是一户农民在烧屋旁茅草时，火碰上大风而延烧山林的；一次是一户农民“烧田坎”后没有把残火扑灭而引起的。湖南桑植县娥子坡乡农民烧灰积肥时不慎，也使西街山发生山火，幸经抢救未成巨灾。某些区乡干部对护林防火工作不够重视，更增加了山火造成的损失。像湖南省安仁县一区区干部刘海棠，在保莲乡领导生产，二月十日该乡发生山火，他却说：“烧荒山，不要紧。”结果山火蔓延，两千多亩森林被焚毁。因此，如果各山林地区的领导机关在领导春耕生产的同时，能够进行防火护林的宣传，教育干部和农民提高警惕，森林火灾是可以减少或者避免的。
    为了防止森林火灾的发生，首先，应该使区、乡干部和农民群众认识防火护林工作的重要意义。应该向他们说明：木材是国家建设中不可缺少的物资，我国现有的木材资源不是过多，而是不足。要供应国家建设所需要的木材，除了积极造林、育林外，还必须保护现有林木不受损失。山火造成的损失是十分巨大的。据河北省一九五三年统计，全省被山火烧毁的树木，如再生长四年，就可供应建筑三万六千多间房屋的檩材。云南省新平县某一个区在一年多时间内，被山火烧毁的林木就值大米二百多万斤。还应该向他们说明森林能调节气候，防止水、旱、风、沙的灾害，保护庄稼丰收。像豫东沙荒区，过去由于受风沙的灾害，农田常常播种两三次才能保苗，原种两季的地只能收一季秋。解放以后，由于逐步植造了防沙林，过去一亩麦田也没有的开封市郊区土城村，在一九五三年就种了小麦三千二百亩，而且产量逐年提高。整个沙荒区的沙荒也逐渐减少了，仅四年就扩大了耕地面积十五万亩。各山林地区的领导机关如果能拿当地的具体生动的事例对干部和农民进行宣传，使他们更深刻地认识保护森林对国家经济建设的重要意义，对自己生产所起的良好作用，他们就会自觉地积极地进行护林防火工作。
    其次，应该在群众自觉的基础上加强组织工作，来贯彻实施杜绝火源的有效办法。像安徽省六安专区去年秋末就针对农民烧草积肥、烧垦萝卜地的习惯，及时加强护林防火的宣传，并组织群众事先做好防火准备工作，使该专区的山林火灾事件逐渐减少，同时也推动了群众的生产。四川省提倡用割草积肥来改变该省农民烧草积肥的习惯；当农民需要灰肥时，提倡组织起来在无风天气和离开林地较远的空旷地去烧；在少数民族地区提倡精耕细作，改变“刀耕火种”的落后生产方式；对于烧垦，一般是禁止的；但在农民迫切需要扩大耕地面积时，必须报请区、乡人民政府批准，严密组织起来，做好各项防火准备工作才能进行。这种针对火源组织群众加以预防的做法，据各地经验证明，是很有效的。
    春耕季节，各山林地区应该围绕春耕生产的农事活动来进行护林防火工作。只要使护林防火工作能够密切地结合生产活动，护林工作就能够做好，春耕生产也决不会受到影响。如不少地区的农民在春耕中要“烧田坎”，以消灭田坎上的野草，减少虫害，并利用草灰作肥料。如果各地能够发动农民有组织地进行这个工作，既可以防止山火；又可以避免分散进行时你烧我不烧的情况，更有效地防止虫害。又如有些地区的农民在春季要入山打柴和割草积肥，在山中吸烟、烤干粮，都很容易引起火灾。如果能够通过合作社和互助组做出样子，发动大家结伙入山，或者进一步组织农民临时互助变工，既可以节省很多人力用于春耕生产，又可以起到互相监督、防止火灾的作用。
    此外，对于森林资源丰富或者山火发生频繁的地区，当地领导机关必须特别加以重视，大张旗鼓地开展护林防火工作。湖北省最近由省人民政府、军区司令部、农林厅、公安厅、人民监察委员会、人民法院等机关组成护林防火指挥部，并派五个小组分赴山火发生频繁的地区进行检查，处理了山林火灾的积案，依法惩处造成火灾的责任者，奖励防火有成绩的人。这一系列的工作，推动了所属各级政府在领导生产时结合进行护林防火工作，扩大了护林防火宣传教育工作的效果，这是值得各地学习的。
