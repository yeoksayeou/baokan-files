    Some Experiences of Shenyang City in Selecting Cadres
    Li Shaowen

    The Organization Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to strengthen the leadership of organizations at all levels and ensure the completion of economic construction tasks, has conducted cadre selection work in 39 state-owned factories, 12 trading companies, 4 bureaus of the Municipal People's Government, and district-level organs in 9 districts, a total of 64 units, since August 1953. This work was successfully concluded by the end of the year.

    Through this work, a large number of outstanding talents were discovered, and many outstanding cadres were promoted, proving that the potential of cadres in factories, enterprises, and state organs is very large. According to the statistics of 26 factories, 11 trading companies, 4 bureaus, and 9 districts, 3,908 cadres can be promoted immediately, and 2,497 cadres can be listed as reserve cadres, including party and mass work cadres such as secretaries and members of the district party committee, secretaries and members of the general branch, branch secretaries, secretaries and ministers of the Youth League committee, and chairmen and members of the trade union; government and enterprise administrative work cadres such as deputy district heads, branch directors, factory directors, managers, section chiefs, section heads, workshop directors, and team leaders; and technical personnel such as engineers, technicians, and technicians. The discovery and promotion of these cadres not only basically filled the cadre vacancies in each unit itself, established one or two sets of reserve cadres, and solved the long-term shortage of cadres and the difficulties caused by it; more importantly, it prepared ideological and organizational groundwork for sending cadres to key factories and projects. According to the preliminary calculation of 31 factories, 342 cadres, including party and mass work, factory administration, and technical personnel, can be sent this year.

    Through this work, not only a large number of cadres were discovered and promoted, but also cadres at all levels and comrades in the cadre work department received extremely profound education, and further understood the spirit of the Party's cadre policy. In particular, after this work, the cadres of the organization and personnel departments further improved their policy and business levels, and basically overcame the long-term busy and passive phenomenon in the past.

    In this work, some experiences and lessons were gained, mainly in the following points:

    Actively carrying out positive education and criticizing various erroneous ideas is the prerequisite for doing a good job in discovering and promoting cadres. In the process of this work, many leading cadres were fully exposed as not only having a unclear understanding of the importance of discovering and promoting cadres, but also a few having conservative, localist and other ideas. They believe that "cadres have already been promoted empty, and no more resources can be squeezed out", "young people have no roots in doing things and cannot be promoted", "promoting young cadres will affect the emotions of old cadres", "not promoting cadres will still do the job", and so on. Individual cadres with serious localist ideas even have resistance emotions. They think, "The cadres are cultivated by our efforts, and they have not done much work yet, and you want to transfer them away, that won't work!" These erroneous ideas are the main obstacles to doing a good job in discovering and promoting cadres, and must be resolved.

    The main method to solve these ideological problems is to carry out in-depth political and ideological education work. At the beginning of the work, a deep education should be carried out among the cadres, so that everyone clearly understands the relationship between the cadre problem and the Party's general line, and its importance in implementing the Party's general line and ensuring the completion of the Party's political tasks. In the process of work, the various erroneous ideas and arguments that are constantly exposed should be deeply analyzed and criticized, so as to work while solving them, first the leaders, then the general; it is necessary to carry out positive education, but also to criticize erroneous ideas.

    Promoting organization, deepening understanding of the situation is an important method of discovering talents. In the past, the fatal weakness of cadre work was that it did not understand the cadres. A large number of talents who emerged from actual work and movements were not known to the cadre department. When cadres needed to be promoted, they suffered from "no talents". Therefore, to promote cadres in large quantities and establish a list of reserve cadres, it is necessary to first take the lead by the chief, mobilize leading cadres at all levels, carefully study the cadres of their unit, select the most outstanding ones to introduce to the cadre department, and put forward specific opinions and reasons for what positions or what reserve cadres they can hold; also let Party members, League members and activists introduce the best people around them for the cadre department to refer to. Then, the organization department and the personnel department, according to these lists, organize forces to go deep into the lower levels to understand and investigate. And comprehensively and systematically study the opinions of leaders, the masses, inside and outside the Party, business departments, etc., as well as their current performance and historical situation, to determine the preliminary list and send it to the Party committee for discussion and decision.

    The advantage of doing this is that it can fully discover talents and ensure quality. Some units, because they did not follow such a step, adopted the practice of only passing through the masses without passing through the leaders, or only being nominated by the leaders without listening to the opinions of the masses, as a result, the talents buried in the cadres and the masses could not be fully discovered, and there was also a phenomenon of hastily "filling the ranks". For example, the Tiexi District People's Government replaced the promotion of organization at all levels and the careful understanding of the masses with the method of nomination by the chief, and as a result, 6 out of the 18 cadres proposed did not meet the requirements; another example is the Dadong District People's Government, the district head did not explain the policies and conditions for promoting cadres to the section chiefs, and ordered them to blindly propose lists, and as a result, most of the lists proposed were politically backward and lacking in ability; more seriously, the chemical factory convened a conference of all cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League who were separated from production and those who were not, to carry out mobilization, causing ideological fluctuations among some cadres who were uneasy in their work, while some cadres "supported each other". Therefore, in the work of selecting cadres, while opposing conservative ideas, we must also oppose the tendency of being sloppy and perfunctory.

    When discovering and promoting cadres, it is also necessary to combine the work of establishing and improving the list of reserve cadres and the cadre training system to ensure the continuous growth of the cadre source. In order to enable the newly promoted cadres to do a good job and the reserve cadres to grow rapidly, it is necessary to strengthen the training of cadres. To this end, all units have checked the shortcomings of the past cadre training work, such as unrealistic plans and lack of regular supervision and inspection, and criticized the common erroneous ideas existing among cadres. Such as thinking that: "Cadres can 'naturally become successful when the time comes', no training is needed", "No one trained me when I was the workshop director", "Busy with work, no time to train", "I still need to ask others to train, how can I have the ability to train others", as well as thinking that "factories and organs are not places to train cadres", "On-the-job training of cadres occupies the establishment and delays production (or work), it is better to send them to school to study", "Training cadres is the responsibility of the organization and personnel departments, it has nothing to do with me" and other wrong understandings.

    In the process of discovering and promoting cadres, all units have established and improved the list of reserve cadres and the cadre training system. According to the specific characteristics of each reserve cadre, a practical training plan has been formulated to carry out the training work in a planned manner. Each reserve cadre is assigned a special person to be responsible for training. The training methods are generally: strengthening their business learning to improve their business level; using the method of apprenticeship to regularly and gradually assign them a part of the leadership work to do, to exercise their leadership ability; timely checking and helping their work, examining their ideological situation, and helping them improve their political and ideological level; absorbing them to participate in certain meetings, to broaden their horizons and familiarize themselves with the overall situation, and so on.

    Whether regular training work is established and adhered to depends entirely on the Party committee's regular inspection and supervision. Therefore, in addition to regularly examining the production situation of reserve cadres and checking the work of those responsible for training cadres, the organization and personnel departments must report these situations to the Party committee, and the Party committee should also regularly discuss cadre work. Those reserve cadres who should be promoted should be promoted in a timely manner, and those who cannot continue to be trained should be removed from the list in a timely manner. New talents discovered should also be added to the list at any time. Those who have achieved success in training cadres should be commended and their experiences summarized and promoted; those who are irresponsible in training cadres should be criticized. By doing so, the work of training reserve cadres will not become a mere formality.

    沈阳市选拔干部的几点经验
    李绍文
    中共沈阳市委组织部，为加强各级组织的领导力量，保证经济建设任务的完成。从一九五三年八月起，先后在三十九个国营工厂、十二个贸易公司、市人民政府四个局，以及九个区的区级机关，共六十四个单位中进行了选拔干部的工作，至年底已胜利结束。
    通过这一工作、发现了大批优秀人材，提拔了不少优秀干部，证明在工厂、企业以及国家机关中干部的潜在力是很大的。根据二十六个工厂、十一个贸易公司、四个局、九个区的统计，可以立即提拔的干部有三千九百零八名，可列为后备干部的有二千四百九十七名，内中包括中共区委书记和区委部长、总支书记和总支委员、支部书记、青年团团委书记和部长、工会主席和委员等党群工作干部；副区长、分局长、厂长、经理、科长、股长、车间主任、工段长等政府和企业行政工作干部，以及工程师、技师、技术员等技术人员。由于这些干部的发现与提拔，不但基本上配齐了各个单位本身的干部缺额，建立了一至二套的后备干部，解决了干部长期不足以及因此造成的困难；更重要的是为给重点工厂和工程输送干部作好了思想准备和组织准备。据三十一个工厂的初步计算，本年中可输送的干部有三百四十二名，内中也包括党群工作、工厂行政、技术人员等各种干部。
    通过这一工作，不仅发现和提拔了大批干部，同时使各级干部和干部工作部门的同志，得到了极其深刻的教育，进一步地领会了党的干部政策的精神。特别是组织和人事部门的干部经过这次工作，还进一步的提高了政策业务水平，基本上克服了过去长期存在的忙乱、被动的现象。
    在这次工作中，取得了一些经验教训，主要有以下几点：
    积极进行正面教育，批判各种错误思想，是做好发现与提拔干部工作的先决条件。在这次工作过程中，充分暴露了许多领导干部不仅对发现与提拔干部的重要意义认识不清，而且少数的还存在着保守、本位主义等思想。他们认为“干部早已提空了，挤不出油水来了”、“年纪轻，办事没有根，不能提拔”、“提拔了青年干部会影响老干部的情绪”、“不提拔干部也一样干工作”等。个别本位思想严重的干部，甚至存在抗拒情绪。他们认为“干部是我们出力培养的，还没有干出多少活来，你们就要调走，那可不行！”这些错误思想是做好发现和提拔干部工作的主要障碍，必须予以解决。
    解决这些思想问题的主要方法是进行深入的政治思想教育工作。在工作开始时，应在干部中进行一次深刻的教育，使大家明确认识干部问题和党的总路线的关系，和在贯彻党的总路线，保证党的政治任务完成中的重要意义。在工作过程中，应对不断暴露的各种错误思想和论调进行深刻的分析批判，做到边工作、边解决，先领导、后一般；要进行正面教育，也要批判错误思想。
    推动组织、深入了解情况，是发掘人材的重要方法。过去干部工作上的致命弱点，就是对干部不了解，从实际工作和运动中涌现出来的大批人材，干部部门也不知道，到要提拔干部时，就苦于“没有人材”。因此，要大批提拔干部、建立后备干部名单，就必须首先由首长带头，动员各级领导干部，把本单位的干部仔细的研究一遍，挑选最优秀的介绍给干部部门，并提出能担任什么职务或什么后备干部的具体意见和理由；也让党团员和积极分子把自己周围最好的人介绍出来，供干部部门参考。然后，组织部门和人事部门，根据这些名单，组织力量、深入下层了解、考察。并把领导、群众，党内、党外，业务部门等各方面的意见，及其本人目前的表现和历史情况，全面地、系统地加以研究，以确定初步的名单，送党委讨论决定。
    这样做的好处，是可以充分发掘人材，保证质量。有些单位因为没有按照这样一个步骤进行，采取只经过群众不经过领导，或单由领导提名，不听取群众意见的做法，结果不能使埋藏在干部群众中的人材得以充分发掘，并且还发生了草率从事“滥竽充数”等现象。如铁西区人民政府以首长提名办法代替了推动组织层层发掘，和深入群众仔细了解的做法，结果在提出的十八名干部中，有六名是不合要求的；又如大东区人民政府，区长不向科长交代提拔干部的政策和条件，令其盲目提名单，结果提出的名单，大部是政治落后，能力不强的人；更严重的是化学工厂，召开了全厂脱离生产与不脱离生产的党、行政、工会、青年团的全体干部大会，进行动员，造成部分干部思想波动，不安心工作，部分干部则互相“捧场”。因此，在选拔干部的工作中，在反对保守思想的同时，还必须反对马虎草率，敷衍了事的偏向。
    在发现和提拔干部时，还必须结合进行建立和健全后备干部名单和干部培养制度的工作，保证干部源泉的不断生长。为了使新提拔的干部做好工作，后备干部迅速成长，就必须加强对干部的培养工作。为此，各单位都检查了过去培养干部工作中计划不切实际、缺乏经常性的督促检查等缺点，并对干部中存在的带普遍性的错误思想，进行了批判。如认为：“干部可以‘功夫到了自然成’、不需要培养”、“我当车间主任时也没有人培养我”、“工作忙没有时间培养”、“我还需要叫别人培养，哪有本事培养别人”，以及认为“工厂机关不是培养干部的场所”、“在职培养干部，占编制又误生产（或工作），不如送到学校去学习”、“培养干部是组织和人事部门的事，与我无关”等错误认识。
    在发现和提拔干部的过程中，各单位均建立与健全了后备干部的名单和干部培养制度。针对每个后备干部的具体特点，制订了切实可行的培养计划，以有计划地进行培养工作。每个后备干部，都指定专人负责培养。培养的方法一般是：加强他们的业务学习，以提高业务水平；以带徒弟的方式，经常地逐步地适量地交他们一部分领导工作做，以锻炼其领导能力；及时地对他们的工作进行检查和帮助，考察他们的思想情况，帮助他们提高政治思想水平；吸收他们参加一定会议，来扩大他们眼界，熟悉全面情况等等。
    经常的培养工作是否建立起来与坚持下去，全赖于党委的经常检查和督促。因此组织部门和人事部门，除了要经常考察后备干部的生产情况，检查负责培养干部的人的工作外，必须将这些情况向党委做报告，党委亦应定期讨论干部工作。对后备干部该提拔的应及时提拔，不能继续培养的应及时除名。发现新的人材也应随时补充到名单中去。对于培养干部有成绩的人应给以表扬，并总结其经验，加以推广；对培养干部不负责任的人，则应给以批评。这样做，培养后备干部的工作，就不致流于形式。
