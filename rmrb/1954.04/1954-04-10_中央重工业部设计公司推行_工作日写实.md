    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Design Company Promotes "Working Day Real-Time Recording"
    The Design Company of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry is learning from advanced Soviet experience and promoting "Working Day Real-Time Recording," which has achieved good results. "Working Day Real-Time Recording" means that each person fills out a pre-printed form every day with their work and the time spent. The company first conducted pilot projects in the Finance Section and the Secretariat Section. The results proved that "Working Day Real-Time Recording" is a good way to tap the internal potential of government agencies and enterprises. From the "Work Real-Time Recording" form, it can be seen what work each employee did in a month and each day, and how much time was spent working each month and day. For example, in the Finance Section, the average working time per person per day was only six hours and thirty-seven minutes, and in the Secretariat Section, the average working time per person per day was only five hours and three minutes. Some people had an average working time of only three hours and fifteen minutes per day. From the "Work Real-Time Recording" form, it is possible to understand the scope of business of a unit and to discover the phenomenon of unreasonable division of labor. For example, the Secretariat Section has an internal correspondent who is only responsible for delivering newspapers and personal letters, but the work of delivering "Heavy Industry Communications" and internal company notices is done by another staff member concurrently. Many similar unreasonable phenomena have been discovered. According to preliminary statistics, six people can be reduced in the two pilot sections.
    After the implementation of this method, the enthusiasm of the staff has been strengthened, and they have taken the initiative to find work to do. For example, Xu Fengshun, a mimeograph operator in the Secretariat Section, saw that he had little work to do and automatically asked the section chief to assign more work. In the past, the accounting stock of the Finance Section had three people doing reports, and the monthly reports could not be reported until after the tenth of the following month; after the implementation of "Working Day Real-Time Recording," only one person was needed to do it, and it could be reported in five days.
    At present, the "Working Day Real-Time Recording" system has been widely promoted in the company's administrative sections. (Li Zhongmin)

    中央重工业部设计公司推行“工作日写实”
    中央人民政府重工业部设计公司学习苏联先进经验，推行“工作日写实”收到良好效果。“工作日写实”就是每人每天将自己的工作和所花费的时间，填写在印好的表格里。该公司首先在财务科、秘书科进行试点，试行结果，证明“工作日写实”是挖掘机关企业内部潜在力量的好办法。从“工作写实”表上能看出每个工作人员在一个月内和每一天做了那些工作，每月每日工作时间有多少。如财务科每人平均每天工作时间只有六小时三十七分，秘书科每人平均每天工作时间只有五小时零三分。其中有的人平均每天只有三小时十五分的工作时间。从“工作写实”表上可以了解一个单位的业务范围，可以发现人员分工不合理的现象。如秘书科有一个对内通讯员，每天只管送报纸和私人信件，但送“重工业通讯”和公司内部通知的工作，却由另一个工作人员兼做。类似这种不合理的现象还发现了不少，据初步统计，两个试点科内可减少六人。
    实行这个办法后，工作人员的积极性加强了，主动找工作做，如秘书科油印员徐凤顺看到自己的工作少，就自动地要求科长多分配工作。财务科账务股过去由三个人做报表，每月报表要在下月十日以后才能报出；实行“工作日写实”后，只要一个人做，五日就能报出去了。
    目前，“工作日写实”制度已在该公司各行政科普遍推行。　（李仲珉）
