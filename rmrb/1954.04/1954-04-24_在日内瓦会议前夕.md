Geneva Correspondence

    On the Eve of the Geneva Conference
    By Our Special Correspondent Wu Wentao
    The shopkeepers on the shores of Lake Geneva are increasingly busy receiving foreign guests. The Geneva Conference is about to open. For Geneva, a city nestled by mountains and water, international conferences are nothing new. The cold, snowy, and rainy weather around Easter is, of course, a topic of conversation for the citizens of Geneva, but people are showing extra concern for this conference aimed at easing international tensions. At least, as the National Democratic Party's "Journal de Genève" said today (April 22nd): Western countries should seize every possible opportunity for negotiation, especially since this is their first political negotiation with China, and China is represented by such an important figure as Zhou Enlai.
    People all over the world who oppose war and demand peace are looking forward to the success of the Geneva Conference. Like in France (Geneva is only separated from it by the clear waters of Lake Geneva), for many days, how to stop the war in Indochina has become the central issue of public opinion.
    The fierce opposition of the French people from all walks of life to the war that slaughters the people of Indochina is very easy to understand. Many people in the bourgeoisie also seem to understand the Chinese proverb "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind." Only Washington and its small group of followers in Paris advocate continuing the war, just like the "European Army" plan that is unpopular with the French, because it (the European Army plan) is a knife that the United States forces into France's hand, telling France to commit suicide. Just a few days ago, when Dulles visited Paris, former French President Auriol also pointed out in a series of articles published in "France-Soir" that the Bonn and Paris treaties "are tools for restoring Germany's freedom of action." In other words, in the European Army plan, France would have to hand over its armed forces and become a country without its own armed forces, while Adenauer's Nazi army, which has been rearmed, could, with the consent of the United States, be sent to places like Alsace for "common security." All of Washington's sweet words of guarantee to France are nothing more than what "L'Humanité" reveals: "You (France) commit suicide, and I (the United States) will support you!"
    In mid-April, Dulles came to London and Paris and prescribed the poison pill of a so-called "military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific similar to the North Atlantic Alliance" with the goal of undermining the Geneva Conference and expanding the war in Indochina through "united action." Bidault accepted it, but French public opinion was in an uproar. Just looking at the reactions of some French bourgeois newspapers is enough.
    As early as when Dulles set off from Washington, "Paris Radical News" said in an editorial that "Dulles' lightning trip to Europe risks greatly changing the political and military face of the Indochina War." The newspaper said: "France should first seek a way to achieve a ceasefire... Geneva will provide an opportunity to end the war through negotiations. France must not ignore any diplomatic avenue that can lead to a peaceful solution." Regarding Dulles' "united action," the newspaper revealed: "...It is even more unthinkable that under the assumption of united action, the United States would agree to place its troops under the command of a French general. Washington seems to be assuming the role of commander in Indochina. This prospect deserves careful consideration."
    On April 15th, in an editorial commenting on the "military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific," Paris' "Combat" said: "These plans are not without danger. In fact, this is one of the methods by which the United States is trying to bring countries that Paris has always hoped to maintain within the French Union into the sphere of American influence… It can be said with certainty that the American representatives will go to Geneva with the firm belief that the conference will not produce any results." On the same day, Paris' "Le Monde" also said in an editorial: "At present, the most pressing issue that Dulles and the French ministers should discuss is not to decide what attitude to take if the Geneva conference fails, nor to decide that the conflict in Indochina must be immediately internationalized if the conference fails, but to determine what should be done in Geneva and the best way to seek a negotiated peace." In a special article the next day entitled "France Should Maintain its Freedom in the Geneva Negotiations," "Le Monde" further criticized the lack of a clear statement of an attitude of peaceful consultation in the U.S.-French communiqué: "The Americans make no secret of the fact that, in their view, any compromise with the Viet Minh, whether in the form of a coalition government of Vietnamese parties or a division of territory, is a victory for communism. They believe that the only solution is for the Viet Minh to surrender and lay down its arms, which the Americans themselves failed to achieve in Korea... This policy will in no way give France any opportunity to obtain a negotiated solution in Geneva." The newspaper finally asked: "Have the French ministers... studied in detail the conditions for an acceptable 'honorable' peace? Before or during the Geneva Conference, French ministers must have the possibility of making their friends and enemies accept the reasonableness and realism of the proposals."
    So, isn't the problem clear? Those who want to continue the war in Indochina are first and foremost the Dulleses of the United States. The belligerent words recently spoken by U.S. Vice President Nixon, but which he then tried to cover up, are enough to prove this. Recently, British newspapers such as the London "Times" and "News Chronicle," in explaining that British and American policies are not entirely consistent, also said that the American idea is to fight in Indochina for at least another year or two.
    Speaking of the attitude expressed by the British bourgeois newspapers, it is not difficult to see its contradictions. Under the growing voice of the British people opposing turning Indochina into a "second Korea," the newspapers are all explaining that Britain is not opposed to a negotiated solution to the Indochina issue; but at the same time, they are unwilling to admit that because Eden, like Bidault, accepted Dulles' plan for "establishing a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific similar to the North Atlantic Alliance," this will tie Britain's hands by the United States. Of course, there are also strange arguments like that of the British "Spectator" (April 16th): On the one hand, it seems to be saying that in Geneva, in addition to the Korean and Indochina issues, the recognition of New China, the issue of New China's seat in the United Nations, and the issue of increasing trade with China will be discussed behind the scenes, but at the same time, it also says that "the correct policy of the Western countries can be summarized in such a contradiction: 'If Geneva (the conference) succeeds, it will be a failure; if it fails, it will be a success!'"
    If we want to summarize the situation on the eve of the Geneva Conference, one thing is clear: the danger of the war in Indochina expanding still exists seriously, and Washington is and will continue to exert pressure on its British and French allies in Geneva; the Dulleses are as afraid of peace as owls are of the sun. Of course, peace-loving people will continue to express their attitudes.

### 在日内瓦会议前夕

    在日内瓦会议前夕
    本报特派记者　吴文焘
    莱蒙湖畔的店家们日益忙碌地接待着外国的来宾。日内瓦会议就要开幕了。对于日内瓦这个依山傍水的城市来说，国际性的会议本不是什么稀奇的事。在“复活”节前后的这些天里，忽雪忽雨的阴寒天气，自然是日内瓦市民们的一种谈话资料，可是人们对这次旨在缓和国际紧张局势的会议，是表现了格外的关怀的。至少，像国家民主党的“日内瓦日报”今天（二十二日）所说的：西方国家应当利用谈判的一切可能机会，特别这次是它们第一次和中国进行政治谈判，而且中国是由周恩来这样重要的人物为代表的。
    全世界反对战争、要求和平的人民，都期待着日内瓦会议的成就。像在法国（日内瓦和它只隔着莱蒙湖的一带碧水），多少天来，如何停止印度支那的战争，成了舆论的中心问题。
    法国各阶层人民的激烈反对屠杀印度支那人民的战争，是十分容易理解的。资产阶级的不少人士，也似乎懂得了“螳螂捕蝉，黄雀在后”这句中国谚语。只有华盛顿和它在巴黎的一小群随从者主张继续战争，正像那不得法国人心的“欧洲军”计划一样，因为它（欧洲军计划）是一把美国强加于法国手里、叫法国自杀的刀子。就在前几天杜勒斯访问巴黎的时候，法国前总统阿里奥尔也在其发表于“法兰西晚报”的一系列文章中，指出波恩和巴黎条约“是恢复德国自由行动的工具”。换句话说，在欧洲军计划里，法国要把自己的武装力量交出来，变成没有自己武装力量的国家，而重新武装起来的阿登纳的纳粹军，只须得到美国的一声同意，就可以为了“共同安全”开到例如阿尔萨斯这些地方去。华盛顿对法国的一切甜言蜜语的保证，也不过是像“人道报”所揭示的：“你（法国）自杀吧，我（美国）来支持你！”
    四月中旬杜勒斯来到伦敦和巴黎，在破坏日内瓦会议和以“联合行动”扩大印度支那战争的目标下，开出了所谓“在东南亚和西太平洋建立一个和北大西洋联盟相似的军事联盟”这丸毒药。皮杜尔接受了，但法国舆论却为之哗然。只要看看法国一些资产阶级报纸的反应就够了。
    早在杜勒斯从华盛顿动身的时候，“巴黎激进新闻”的专论就说“杜勒斯的欧洲闪电旅行，将有大大改变印度支那战争的政治和军事面貌的危险”。该报说：“法国首先应当寻求停战的办法……日内瓦将提供用谈判来结束战争的机会。法国决不能忽视可以达到和平解决的任何外交途径。”对于杜勒斯的“联合行动”，该报揭露道：“……更不能设想在联合行动的假定下，美国会同意把它的军队置于法国将军的统率之下。华盛顿似乎将担当印度支那方面的指挥者。这个前景值得仔细考虑。”
    四月十五日，在评论“东南亚和西太平洋军事联盟”的专论中，巴黎的“战斗报”说：“这些计划并不是没有危险的。事实上，这是美国竭力使巴黎向来希望维持在法兰西联邦内的国家，落入美国势力范围的方法之一……。可以肯定地说，美国代表将带着会议不会产生什么结果的坚定不移的信念去日内瓦的。”同一天的巴黎“世界报”的社论也说：“目前，杜勒斯和法国部长们所应讨论的最迫切问题，不是决定如果日内瓦会议失败了应该采取的态度，也不是决定如果会议失败了印度支那的冲突必须立刻国际化，而是确定在日内瓦应该作什么，以及求得协商和平的最好方法。”在第二天的一篇题为“在日内瓦协商中法国应该保持它的自由”的专文中，“世界报”进一步指责美法公报中没有把和平协商的态度明确化：“美国人丝毫不隐瞒：在他们看来，和越盟作任何妥协，不论是越南各党派的联合政府形式或是划地分治，都是共产主义的胜利。他们认为唯一的解决办法，就是要越盟屈服、放下武器，而这是美国人自己未能在朝鲜获得的。……这个政策在任何情况下都不会使法国有任何机会在日内瓦获得协商解决的。”该报最后问道：“法国的部长们是否已经……详细研究了可以接受的‘光荣’和平的条件呢？在日内瓦会议之前或是在日内瓦会议中，只有提案的合理性和现实性，法国部长们要有使其友方和敌方接受的可能性。”
    那么，问题还不清楚吗？要在印度支那继续战争的，首先就是美国的杜勒斯们。美国副总统尼克松最近说出的、但又想掩饰的好战的话，足以证明这点；最近英国的伦敦“泰晤士报”、“新闻纪事报”等在解释英国和美国政策并不完全一致时，也说美国的主意是至少还在印度支那打一两年。
    说到英国资产阶级报纸所表现的态度，人们不难看出它的自相矛盾的地方。在英国人民日益反对把印度支那变成“第二个朝鲜”的呼声下，各报都在说明英国并非不主张协商解决印度支那问题；但同时，它们都不肯承认：由于艾登和皮杜尔一样接受了杜勒斯的“在东南亚和西太平洋建立一个和北大西洋联盟相似的军事联盟”计划，这就将会使英国的手被美国束缚起来。当然，还有像英国“旁观者报”（四月十六日）那样的怪论调：一方面，它似乎在说：在日内瓦，除了朝鲜和印度支那问题外，承认新中国、新中国在联合国的席位问题、增加和中国进行贸易问题等都会在幕后讨论，但同时，它又说“西方国家的正确政策可以总结为这样的矛盾：‘日内瓦（会议）如果成功了，它就是失败了；如果它失败了，那就是成功了！’”
    如果要概括日内瓦会议前夕的情况的话，有一点是很清楚的，那就是：印度支那战争扩大的危险仍然严重存在着，华盛顿正在而且还将继续在日内瓦对其英法同盟者施行压力；杜勒斯们的害怕和平，就像夜猫子怕见太阳一样。当然，爱好和平的人民也会继续表示自己的态度的。
                      四月二十二日于日内瓦
