    New Tricks by the United States to Coerce France into Accepting the "European Army" Treaty
    Tan Wenrui
    On April 13th, Britain and the six countries participating in the "European Defense Community" signed an agreement on "cooperation" between Britain and the "European Defense Community." Three days later, U.S. President Eisenhower also issued a letter to the prime ministers of these six countries, reiterating U.S. support for the "European Defense Community" policy. This is the long-noisy trick of the so-called Anglo-American "guarantee," the purpose of which is to deceive Western European countries, especially French public opinion, making them believe that with such a "guarantee," they no longer need to fear that the West German militarist forces revived under the cover of the "European Defense Community" will threaten their security.
    This so-called "guarantee" from the U.S. and Britain is a complete hoax. Anyone can see that neither Britain nor the United States has undertaken any new obligations in their "guarantee." Britain had already provided similar "cooperation" guarantees to five of the six participating countries of the "European Defense Group" in the North Atlantic Treaty in the past, except that Britain now extends this "cooperation" to West Germany. Britain has indicated its readiness to provide an armored division to establish "the closest cooperation" with the future "European Army," but the fact is, as Paris's "Liberation" newspaper said: "Britain's attitude towards the European Defense Community has not advanced an inch." The American "guarantee" is even more absurd. Eisenhower actually described "the United States will continue to maintain the necessary and appropriate number of armed forces in Europe - including Germany" as a "guarantee" of Western European security. But when did the United States ever plan to withdraw its troops from West Germany and some other Western European countries? Wasn't the United States vehemently opposed to the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw troops from Germany at the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference? The people of Western European countries have long believed that the United States' attempt to station troops in West Germany and France is creating a "power base" for the division of Europe and war, and has seriously infringed upon the sovereignty of many countries.
    The American "guarantee," and the task the United States has arranged for Britain in this trick, are to force Western Europe, especially France, to ratify the "European Army" treaty and to quickly establish the "European Army." This is a serious provocation to the security of Western European countries. Because, the main purpose of organizing the "European Defense Group" is to rebuild West Germany's military strength, to put the armies of Western European countries participating in the "European Army" under the control of West German militarists, and to let the resurrected Hitler's Wehrmacht appear on the territory of France and other Western European countries, and what the United States and Britain want to "guarantee" is the emergence of this situation. People will not forget that the same Eisenhower who is now providing "guarantees" to France publicly stated more than a year ago: "I do not agree with those who think that the German army should be strong in the crusades against the East, but should be weak in the crusades against the West." Obviously, what the US ruling clique cares about is only how to revive West German militarist forces to serve the US plan to prepare for a new war; they do not care about the security of France and the whole of Europe.
    The American ruling clique has long considered France's delay in ratifying the "European Army" treaty as the main obstacle to the "European Defense Community" plan. After the end of the Berlin Conference, the United States used various pressures to force France to quickly ratify the "European Army" treaty. Dulles once personally issued an "ultimatum" to France, and American reactionary senators kept threatening to terminate "aid," and Washington even set a timetable for the French government to ratify the "European Army" treaty. But all these rude methods did not achieve the desired effect. On the contrary, they made the struggle against the "European Army" in France more intense. It was only because there was such a group of people in the French ruling clique who proposed to take the solution of the Saar issue and the Anglo-American security "guarantee" as "preconditions" for approving the "European Army" plan, that it opened the door for the United States to induce France to accept the "European Army" treaty. Because, apart from the demand to resolve the Saar issue which made the United States, which was unwilling to let its Bonn darling suffer, feel difficult, it was easy to provide the so-called "guarantee" for the United States. As for the British government group, although it has always been unwilling to place itself within the "European Defense Community," it still follows the American adventurous policy of reviving German militarism. Thus, under the pressure of the United States, it also put forward a "guarantee" after making many reservations, to conspire with the United States to force France to ratify the "European Army" treaty.
    However, this clumsy "guarantee" trick of the United States cannot deceive anyone. The broad masses of the French people clearly know that any plan to revive West German militarism, no matter how disguised, is a serious threat to French security. Only by restoring Germany to a unified, democratic and peace-loving country, and only by eliminating the division and mutual antagonism in Europe, can their security be truly and reliably guaranteed. Therefore, after the United States and Britain put forward the so-called "guarantee," even people like French Finance Minister Faure expressed their opposition to France's participation in the "European Army." Bourgeois newspapers of various backgrounds in France have generally exposed the deceptive nature of this "guarantee." A leader of the de Gaulle faction issued a statement saying: "We also note that France is also facing a threat, that is, a deceptive guarantee from the United States, a deceptive agreement on the Saar issue, and pressure to have France ratify the unacceptable European Defense Community treaty." It can be seen that the American means of coercion and enticement towards France will not only not help to improve the difficult situation of the French ruling group, but on the contrary, it will only deepen the political crisis in France.
    The people of Western European countries clearly know that the fact that the United States and Britain use this "guarantee" to induce Western European countries to accept the "European Army" treaty proves that the United States is determined to disregard the universal desire of the European people to ensure European collective security, and to stubbornly implement its war policy of splitting Europe and reviving German militarism. At the same time, this also proves that the United States is not prepared to consider the Soviet Union's new proposal to the United States, Britain and France on March 31 that the Soviet Union is prepared to join the North Atlantic Treaty in order to facilitate the establishment of a European collective security system. However, since the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a European collective security system has taken root in the hearts of the people in Europe. The Soviet Union's proposal to join the North Atlantic Treaty has also gained widespread sympathy and support in Western European public opinion. The people of Western European countries have once again seen that the Soviet Union is making unremitting efforts to ensure European security. All the hegemonic practices of the US ruling clique will only arouse greater resistance from the people of Western European countries.

    美国诱迫法国接受“欧洲军”条约的新把戏
    谭文瑞
    英国与参加“欧洲防务集团”的六国于四月十三日签订了一项英国和“欧洲防务集团”的“合作”协定，三天之后美国总统艾森豪威尔也发表了一封写给这六国总理的重申美国支持“欧洲防务集团”政策的信。这就是喧嚷已久的所谓美英“保证”的把戏，其目的是想欺骗西欧国家特别是法国的舆论，使人相信好像有了这样的“保证”，他们可以不用再害怕在“欧洲防务集团”掩护下复活起来的西德军国主义势力会威胁他们的安全。
    美英这种所谓“保证”，是一个彻头彻尾的骗局。谁都看得见，不论英国还是美国，并没有在它们的“保证”中承担有任何新的义务。英国过去在北大西洋公约中早已向“欧洲防务集团”的六个参加国中的五个国家提供过类似的“合作”的保证，只不过现在英国把这种“合作”扩及到西德。英国表示准备拿出一个装甲师来和未来的“欧洲军”建立“最密切的合作”关系，但是，事实恰如巴黎的
  “解放报”所说的：“英国对欧洲防务集团的态度，并未前进寸步。”美国的“保证”，那就更加荒谬了。艾森豪威尔竟把“美国将继续在欧洲——包括德国在内——保持必需的与合宜的数量的武装部队”说成是对西欧安全的“保证”。但是，美国曾在什么时候打算从西德和西欧一些国家撤军呢？美国在柏林四国外长会议上不正是竭力反对苏联主张在德国撤军的建议吗？西欧各国人民早就认为，美国企图在西德和法国等国驻兵，是制造欧洲分裂和战争的“实力基础”，并已严重地侵犯到了许多国家的主权。
    美国的“保证”，和美国在这个把戏中给英国安排的任务，是为了逼迫西欧特别是法国批准“欧洲军”条约，把“欧洲军”迅速建立起来。这是对西欧各国安全的严重挑衅。因为，组织“欧洲防务集团”的主要目的，就是要重建西德的军事力量，要把参加“欧洲军”的西欧各国的军队交由西德军国主义者控制，让复活的希特勒国防军出现在法国和其他西欧国家的领土上，而美国和英国所要“保证”的正是这个局面的出现。人们不会忘记，现在给法国提供“保证”的同一个艾森豪威尔，在一年多以前曾公开说过：“我不赞成那些认为德军在对东方的十字军征伐上应当是强大的，而同时在对西方的征伐上却应当是软弱的说法。”显然，美国统治集团所关心的只是如何复活西德军国主义势力来为美国准备发动新战争的计划服务；对于法国和整个欧洲的安全，他们是不放在心里的。
    美国统治集团早就认为法国在批准“欧洲军”条约上的拖延不决是“欧洲防务集团”计划的主要障碍。柏林会议结束以后，美国就以各种压力来强迫法国迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。杜勒斯曾亲自向法国下过“最后通牒”，美国反动议员不停地以终止“援助”来进行要挟，华盛顿方面甚至给法国政府规定了批准“欧洲军”条约的时间表。但是这一切粗暴的手段并没有收到预期的效果，相反地却使得法国国内反对“欧洲军”的斗争更加激烈起来。只是由于法国统治集团中有这样一部分人，他们提出要以萨尔问题的解决和英美的安全“保证”作为赞成“欧洲军”计划的“先决条件”，这才给美国诱骗法国接受“欧洲军”条约打开了方便之门。因为，除了解决萨尔问题的要求使不愿意叫它的波恩宠儿吃亏的美国为难以外，要美国提供所谓“保证”，那是轻而易举的事。至于英国政府集团，虽然一直不愿置身于“欧洲防务集团”之中，但它仍然追随美国复活德国军国主义的冒险政策，于是，它在美国的压力下也就在作了许多保留以后提出了“保证”，来与美国共谋逼迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约了。
    但是，美国的这种拙劣的“保证”把戏，骗不了什么人。法国广大阶层人民都清楚地知道，任何复活西德军国主义的计划，不管在怎样的掩饰下，都是对法国安全的严重威胁。只有使德国恢复成为一个统一、民主和爱好和平的国家，只有消除欧洲的分裂和互相敌对的状态，他们的安全才能获得真正可靠的保证。因此，在美国和英国提出所谓“保证”之后，甚至连法国财政部长富尔这样的人也表示反对法国参加“欧洲军”。法国各种不同背景的资产阶级报纸都普遍揭穿这种“保证”的欺骗性质。戴高乐派领袖发表了一个声明说：“我们也注意到，法国也面临着一种威胁，那就是美国的一项骗人的保证，关于萨尔问题的一项骗人的协议以及要法国批准决不能接受的欧洲防务集团条约的压力。”由此可见，美国对法国的威迫利诱的手段，不仅不会有助于改善法国统治集团的为难处境，相反地，它只会使法国的政治危机更加加深。
    西欧各国人民清楚地知道，美英两国以这种“保证”来诱迫西欧各国接受“欧洲军”条约，证明了美国决心无视欧洲人民要求保障欧洲集体安全的普遍愿望，一意孤行地执行它分裂欧洲和复活德国军国主义的战争政策。同时，这也证明了美国不准备考虑苏联在三月三十一日向美英法三国提出的苏联准备参加北大西洋公约以便于建立欧洲集体安全体系的新建议。但是，自从柏林四国外长会议以来，苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，已经在欧洲深入人心。苏联准备参加北大西洋公约的建议，也在西欧舆论中获得了广泛的同情和支持。西欧各国人民又一次看到了苏联正在为保障欧洲安全作着不懈的努力。美国统治集团的一切横蛮做法，只会引起西欧各国人民更大的反抗。
