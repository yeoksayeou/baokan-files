    The spring plowing production in various parts of the country has entered a tense stage. According to past practices and the characteristics of this year's spring plowing, farmers' needs for means of production are currently very urgent, and will be greater than in previous years. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must vigorously meet the needs of farmers and strengthen the supply of means of production. This is a major issue related to whether agriculture can increase production this year, and it is also an important task for supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels. Generally speaking, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have paid more attention to the supply of means of production this year than in the past few years. The amount of means of production that supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions prepared to supply to rural areas in the first quarter of this year was equivalent to 170 percent of the same period last year and 135 percent of the original supply plan for the first quarter of this year. The variety of supplies has also increased compared to the past. In addition to focusing on fertilizers, new-style farm tools, and pesticides, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also strengthened the operation of old-fashioned farm tools, livestock, seeds, vehicle equipment, and a large number of miscellaneous fertilizers. This shows that the supply and marketing cooperatives' idea of serving agricultural production is clearer than in the past, and the erroneous views of "fearing losses, fearing backlogs, and fearing trouble" in operating means of production have been initially overcome. This is a great progress in the improvement of business operations of supply and marketing cooperatives.
    However, despite this, the means of production that supply and marketing cooperatives supply to farmers today still fall far short of the farmers' growing needs. After the land reform and the economic recovery and development in the past few years, the production enthusiasm and investment ability of farmers in the vast rural areas are growing and continuously improving. Especially after the propaganda and education of the general task of the transition period, the farmers' production enthusiasm has become even higher, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed unprecedentedly. In addition, the state implements planned grain purchase and pre-purchase of certain agricultural products. The production funds accumulated in the hands of farmers during this year's spring plowing are more than in any previous year. Therefore, their needs for means of production have not only increased in quantity, but also the types of needs have changed greatly. For example, in areas where the mutual aid and cooperation movement has achieved vigorous development, the organized farmers generally require replacing old farm tools with new ones, replacing small livestock with large livestock, and require adding some means of production. However, the means of production supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives, whether in terms of variety or quantity, cannot meet these needs. In 1952, the amount of means of production supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives across the country accounted for only 5.2 percent of farmers' purchasing power. In 1953, it accounted for 6.2 percent. Although the planned supply number this year increased by 84 percent compared to last year, if we compare it with the typical rural surveys in Hebei and Shandong provinces, where the expenditure on means of production by ordinary farmers accounts for 20 to 30 percent of their purchasing power, the quantity of means of production supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives this year can still only meet one-half or one-quarter of the farmers' needs.
    Of course, under the current situation that the production level of means of production in our country is still very low, it is still very difficult to fully meet the farmers' needs for means of production. To fundamentally solve the supply of means of production, it still depends on the further development of the country's socialist industrialization and the further improvement of the country's agricultural production and animal husbandry production. However, at present, there is still great potential to strive to supply farmers with more means of production. This requires maximizing the production potential of local industries and handicrafts that mainly serve the needs of the local people's production and life, and actively producing farm tools and fertilizers needed by local farmers. Doing these tasks well can increase the supply of means of production to a certain extent. For example, in the past, the fertilizers operated by the Haining County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province only included a few types such as fertilizer powder and bean cake. This year, according to the needs of farmers, the cooperative strengthened the organization of local handicraft production, and the supply quantity has expanded more than five times compared to last year. This shows that it is not only possible but also extremely effective to try to expand the source of local handicraft goods and tap the potential of handicrafts. However, when organizing the supply of means of production, the supply and marketing cooperatives should not only take care of the varieties currently needed by farmers, but also pay attention to the new requirements put forward by the development of the rural economy, and strengthen the supply of new-style farm tools, improved farm tools, and large livestock. Because the increase of these means of production is of great significance to further promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improve agricultural production.
    When organizing local sources of goods, certain products may encounter difficulties in the supply of raw materials. However, if we can vigorously collect all the raw materials that can be utilized in the rural areas, these difficulties can also be properly resolved. For example, in the manufacturing of farm tools, we can collect waste steel scattered in the rural areas and process it locally. The Xiaoshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province collected old iron from rural areas to manufacture farm tools, which not only solved the needs of local farmers, but also reduced the price by 30 percent compared to new iron products, and the quality was not much different from new iron farm tools. The Wenshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yunnan Province vigorously publicized to farmers the purchase of scrap iron to manufacture farm tools and went to the countryside to purchase it, collecting more than 1,000 jin in five days. This shows that there are many scrap steel and other raw materials stored in the folk, and as long as the supply and marketing cooperatives organize forces to purchase them, they can not only solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but also enable farmers to turn dead goods into liquid money and invest in production. In particular, chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers can only be used in economic crop areas in China at present due to insufficient production. Moreover, when using cake fertilizer, it should be used to feed pigs first, and then use pig manure to fertilize. Therefore, in the vast rural areas, it is necessary to vigorously promote the use of natural fertilizers by farmers. The sources of natural fertilizers in rural areas are very rich. In areas with more livestock, more stable manure can be accumulated; in areas with more sown grass seeds, green manure can be accumulated; in mountainous areas, more turf can be cut, fallen leaves can be swept, and mud ash can be burned; in the plain rice areas, more river mud can be twisted and accumulated, and garbage can be swept and accumulated; in areas close to towns and cities, farmers can be organized to buy more night soil; in coastal areas, farmers can be organized to collect rotten fish and stinky shrimp as fertilizer. In addition, various local fertilizers such as silkworm pupae, chicken feathers, pig hair, human hair, miscellaneous bones, eggshells, distiller's grains, soy sauce residue, and various miscellaneous cakes can be fully utilized in various places. As long as the supply and marketing cooperatives in various places organize them, they can receive great benefits and greatly benefit agricultural production.
    Striving to supply farmers with more means of production is not only the task of supply and marketing cooperatives, but also the common task of state-owned commerce, local industry, and handicrafts. But the supply and marketing cooperatives undoubtedly bear the main responsibility. The supply and marketing cooperative is the organizer and main leading force of the rural market, and organizing the supply of means of production and supporting agricultural production is the central link for the supply and marketing cooperative to serve agricultural production. In order to do a good job in the supply of means of production, supply and marketing cooperatives must continue to correct their business ideas, thoroughly change various ideas and practices that despise the supply of means of production, vigorously improve business management, and correctly utilize the enthusiasm of private commerce. In terms of the business management of supply and marketing cooperatives, what is particularly serious at present is that some supply and marketing cooperatives do not allocate and supply the well-organized means of production in a timely manner, but keep them in warehouses and cannot meet with farmers quickly. For example, in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, from January to February 10, the means of production placed in the grassroots cooperatives accounted for 26.3 percent of the number of goods purchased during the same period. There are also some supply and marketing cooperatives that neither post prices nor sell, but these means of production are urgently needed by local farmers. We know that the supply of means of production has a strong timeliness. If the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot supply the well-organized means of production in a timely manner, it will not only delay agricultural production, but also seriously affect the capital turnover of the supply and marketing cooperatives. This is detrimental to both farmers and the cooperative itself.
    In order to strengthen the supply of means of production, it is also necessary to require party committees and local governments at all levels to strengthen their leadership over this work, seize the current tense period of spring plowing production, organize forces to conduct an inspection of the supply of means of production, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner to ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase task.

### 供给农民更多的生产资料

    供给农民更多的生产资料
    全国各地春耕生产已进入紧张的阶段。根据历年的贯例和今年春耕的特点，农民目前对生产资料的需要是很迫切的，而且今年将比往年为多。各级供销合作社必须大力满足农民的需要，加强生产资料的供应工作。这是关系今年农业能否增产的重大问题，也是各级供销合作社当前的一项重要任务。今年各地供销合作社对生产资料的供应，一般地说，已较过去几年重视了。今年第一季度各地供销合作社准备供应农村的生产资料的金额，相当于去年同期的百分之一百七十，相当于今年第一季度原订供应计划的百分之一百三十五。供应的品种也比过去增多，各地供销合作社除了着重经营肥料、新式农具、农药械以外，同时也加强了旧式农具、牲口、种籽、车马用具及大批杂肥等货物的经营。这说明了供销合作社为农业生产服务的思想，已较过去明确，对经营生产资料“怕赔钱、怕积压、怕麻烦”的错误看法已有了初步克服，这是供销合作社改进业务经营的一个很大的进步。
    但是，尽管如此，今天供销合作社供应给农民的生产资料还是远远赶不上农民日益增长的需要。广大农村经过了土地改革和几年来经济的恢复和发展，农民的生产情绪和投资能力都在日益增长和不断提高，特别是经过过渡时期总任务的宣传教育后，农民的生产积极性更加高涨了，互助合作运动有了空前的发展，加以国家实行粮食计划收购和对若干农产品实行预购，农民在今年春耕时积蓄在手中的生产资金，比之过去任何一年都多，因此，他们对生产资料的需要不仅数量增多，而需要的品种也有很大变化。如在互助合作运动获得蓬勃发展的地区，组织起来的农民一般地都要求将旧农具换新农具，将小牲口换大牲口，并要求添置一些生产资料。而供销合作社所供应的生产资料，不论在品种上、数量上，都还不能满足这些需要。一九五二年全国各地供销合作社生产资料供应额仅占农民购买力的百分之五点二，一九五三年占百分之六点二，今年计划供应数虽比去年供应数增加百分之八十四，但如果根据河北、山东两省农村典型调查，以一般农民生产资料的支出，占农民购买力的百分之二十到三十做比较，供销合作社今年生产资料供应的数量仍只能满足农民需要的二分之一或四分之一。
    当然，在我国现有的生产资料生产水平还很低的情况下，要充分满足农民对生产资料的需要，还有很大困难。要从根本上解决生产资料的供应工作，还有待于国家社会主义工业化的进一步发展，和国家农业生产、牧畜生产的进一步提高。但是，在目前争取以更多的生产资料供应给农民，还是有着极大的可能的。这就要尽量发挥那些主要为当地人民生产和生活的需要服务的地方工业和手工业的生产潜力，积极生产为当地农民需要的农具和肥料等。做好了这些工作，就能在一定程度上增加生产资料的供应。譬如，浙江省海宁县供销合作社经营的肥料，过去只有肥田粉、豆饼等几种，今年该社根据农民的需要，加强组织地方手工业生产后，供应数量就较去年扩大了五倍以上。这说明了尽力扩大地方手工业货源、发掘手工业潜力，不仅是可能的也是极为有效的。但是，供销合作社在组织生产资料供应时，除了照顾农民目前需要的品种以外，还应注意农村经济发展所提出的新的要求，加强供应新式农具、改良农具和大牲畜。因为这些生产资料的增加，对进一步推动互助合作运动、提高农业生产都具有重要的意义。
    在组织地方货源时，某些产品可能会遇到原料供应的困难。但是如果能大力收集农村中一切可能利用的原料，这些困难也可以适当得到解决。譬如在制造农具方面，就可以收集散藏在农村中的废钢铁，就地进行加工。浙江省萧山县供销合作社收集农村中的旧铁制造农具，不仅解决了当地农民的需要，且较新铁制的价格降低了百分之三十，质量也和新铁制的农具相差不远。云南省文山县供销合作社大力向农民宣传收购废铁制造农具，并下乡收购，在五天内就收了一千多斤。这说明民间储存的废钢铁及其他原料是很多的，只要供销合作社组织力量加以收购，不仅可解决原料不足的困难，也可以使农民把死货变成活钱，投入生产。特别像化学肥料、饼肥等商品肥料，在我国目前生产不足的情况下，还只能集中用于经济作物地区，而且在使用饼肥时，也应尽可能先用它喂猪，再用猪粪施肥。因此，在广大农村中必须大力提倡农民使用自然肥料。农村自然肥料的来源是非常丰富的，在养畜较多的地区，可以多积厩肥；在播种草子多的地区，可以积压绿肥；在山区可以多割草皮、扫落叶、烧制泥灰；在平原水稻区可以多捻挖河泥、扫积垃圾；在靠近市镇的地区，可组织农民多买大粪；在沿海地区，可组织农民搜集烂鱼、臭虾等作为肥料。此外，各地还可充分利用许多地方性的肥料，如蚕蛹、鸡毛、猪毛、头发、杂骨、蛋壳、酒糟、酱渣和各种杂饼等。只要各地供销合作社加以组织，就可收到很大的功效，大大有利于农业的生产。
    争取供应农民更多的生产资料，这不只是供销合作社的任务，也是国营商业，地方工业，手工业的共同任务。但供销合作社无疑地是担负着主要的责任。供销合作社是农村市场的组织者和主要的领导力量，组织生产资料的供应，扶助农业生产，是供销合作社为农业生产服务的中心环节。供销合作社为了作好生产资料的供应工作，必须继续端正经营思想，彻底转变各种轻视生产资料供应的想法和作法，大力改进经营管理工作，正确地利用私营商业的积极性。在供销合作社的经营管理方面，目前特别严重的，是有些供销合作社对已组织好的生产资料，竟不及时下拨，及时供应，却积压在仓库中，不能迅速和农民见面。譬如黑龙江省肇东县一月到二月十日，摆在基层社的生产资料竟占同时期进货数量的百分之二十六点三。还有一些供销合作社，既不挂牌价，也不出卖，而这些生产资料，都是当地农民迫切需要的。我们知道：生产资料的供应有着强烈的时间性，如果供销合作社不能把已组织好的生产资料及时供应下去，既会耽误农业生产，也会严重的影响供销合作社的资金周转。这对农民和合作社本身都是不利的。
    为了加强生产资料的供应，还应要求各级党委和地方政府加强对这项工作的领导，抓紧目前春耕生产紧张时机，组织力量，对生产资料供应工作进行一次检查，及时发现问题，加以解决，以保证今年农业增产任务的完成。
