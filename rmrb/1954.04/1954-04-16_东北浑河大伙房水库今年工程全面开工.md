    Northeast Hunhe River Dahuo House Reservoir Project to Fully Commence Construction This Year
    [By Our Own Correspondent] After a long period of preparation, the Dahuo House Reservoir project on the Hunhe River in Northeast China fully commenced construction on April 11. In the early morning, colorful flags fluttered in the open-air square in the Dahuo Mountain Valley on the north bank of the Hunhe River, and songs blared from loudspeakers. Nearly ten thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, and laborers from all over the country flocked to the square with joy. Rows of new-style machinery formed a magnificent array. The shouts of "We must build the Dahuo House Reservoir well" rose one after another, shaking the valley. At 1:10 PM, on the dam construction site between the two mountains, machinery roared, and excavators extended their huge buckets. Groundbreaking began. In an instant, the bucket rose, and the first bucket of earth was loaded onto a truck and transported to the spoil ground.
    The amount of work for the Dahuo House Reservoir project this year is considerable. In addition to the water diversion tunnel project, which began last November, construction has also commenced on the 1,367-meter-long and 41-meter-high dam, as well as the spillway project. Among them, the total volume of earth, sand, and stone for the dam project alone could fill 1.2 million three-ton trucks.
    During the construction of the Dahuo House Reservoir project, mechanized operations account for more than 80%, making it one of the most mechanized reservoir projects in China. At the commencement, male and female workers from various machinery teams challenged each other, ensuring project quality and saving a large amount of funds for the country.

    东北浑河大伙房水库今年工程全面开工
    【本报讯】经过长期的准备工作，东北浑河大伙房水库今年工程于四月十一日全面开工。清晨时分，浑河北岸大伙山山谷露天广场上彩旗缤纷，扩音器里歌声响亮，来自全国各地近万名的工农兵劳动大军怀着喜悦的心情涌到了广场，一排排的新式机械列成了雄壮的队伍。“一定修好大伙房水库”的喊声此起彼落，震撼着山谷。下午一点十分，两山间拦河大坝工地上，机械轰鸣，挖土机伸出了巨大的挖斗。破土开始了。转瞬，挖斗升起，第一斗土方装上汽车运往了堆土场。
    今年大伙房水库工程量很大，除去年十一月已经开工的输水道工程外，开工的还有长一千三百六十七公尺、高四十一公尺的拦河大坝以及溢洪道工程。其中拦河大坝工程土、砂、石的总体积就可装满载重三吨的汽车一百二十万辆。
    大伙房水库工程施工中，机械化作业比重占百分之八十以上，是我国水库工程中机械化程度最高的一个工程。开工时，各机械队的男女工人们互相挑战，保证工程质量并要为国家节约大批资金。
