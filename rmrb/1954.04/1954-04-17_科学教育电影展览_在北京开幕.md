    “Science Education Film Exhibition” Opens in Beijing

    Science education films, a new type of film that is both interesting and provides specific scientific and technological knowledge, met the vast audience of the capital for the first time through the "Science Education Film Exhibition." The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the China Association for Science and Technology jointly held an opening ceremony for the exhibition at the Capital Cinema on the evening of the 15th, hosting responsible persons from central and Beijing agencies and organizations, as well as people from the scientific, educational, and literary and artistic circles of the capital.

    At the opening ceremony, more than 1,200 audience members watched four science education films, "Soil and Water Conservation," "Li Xikui's Shunting Method," "Eradicating Rice Pests - The Rice Stem Borer," and "The Zoo," with great interest. These films introduce scientific knowledge closely related to people's lives to the audience through artistic images. Three of them are about industrial and agricultural production. "Soil and Water Conservation" describes how soil erosion has been a major disaster in the Loess Plateau region of Northwest China for many years. It also describes how, since liberation, thanks to the efforts of scientists and the creative wisdom of the people, we have developed many ingenious methods to conserve soil and water and turn barren land into oases. "Li Xikui's Shunting Method" amazed the audience with the outstanding creations of advanced figures of the working class in New China who learned from Soviet advanced experience to improve their work. "Eradicating Rice Pests - The Rice Stem Borer" scientifically summarizes the methods used by farmers in various parts of the South to prevent and control rice borers. If farmers follow these methods, they can easily eliminate rice borers, which will greatly increase the country's wealth.

    The filming of science education films in our country has only been around for a year or two, but these few films already show its important significance for people's lives and production construction.

    At the opening ceremony of the exhibition on the evening of the 15th, Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, and Wang Lanxi, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, both spoke, warmly congratulating the achievements of Chinese film workers and scientific workers in co-producing science education films over the past two years, and encouraging them to produce more and better science education films for the country's economic construction and the people's cultural life.

    “科学教育电影展览”在北京开幕
    一种新的电影片，既有趣味又能具体地给人以科学技术知识的科学教育影片，通过了“科学教育影片展览”第一次和首都广大的观众见面。中央人民政府文化部电影局和中华全国科学技术普及协会特于十五日晚在首都电影院举行展览开幕式，招待中央和北京各机关各团体的负责人和首都的科学界、教育界和文艺界人士。
    在开幕式上，一千二百多观众，以很大的兴趣观看了“水土保持”、“李锡奎调车法”、“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”、“动物园”等四部科学教育影片。这些影片以艺术的形象，把和人民生活有密切关系的科学知识介绍给了观众。其中有三部是关于工农业生产的，“水土保持”描写了水土流失是我国大西北黄土地区历年来的重大灾害；也描写了解放以后由于科学家的努力和人民群众的智慧的创造，我们已经有了许多巧妙地保持水土，变荒地为绿洲的办法。“李锡奎调车法”使观众惊叹地看到新中国的工人阶级的先进人物学习苏联先进经验改进工作的卓越的创造。“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”把南方各地农民防治螟虫的办法科学地集中起来了，农民如果根据这些办法，就很容易把螟虫消灭，也就会给国家增加巨大的财富。
    科学教育影片在我国的拍摄还只有一两年的历史，但从这几部影片里就可以看到它对于人民的生活和生产建设的重要意义。
    在十五日晚的展览开幕式上，中华全国科学技术普及协会副主席茅以升，中央人民政府文化部电影局副局长王阑西都讲了话，热烈地祝贺我国的电影工作者、科学工作者两年来在合作摄制科学教育影片上的成就，并鼓励他们为国家的经济建设、为人民的文化生活制作出更多更好的科学教育影片。
