Shandong Province has achieved successes and gained experience in mobilizing and organizing higher elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production and organizing them for spare-time study.

Last summer, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, most of the higher elementary school graduates in Shandong Province participated in agricultural labor. They improved their understanding and strengthened their labor concepts in production work, and all expressed their determination to work hard to learn production techniques, increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, support national construction, and strive for the early realization of socialism. In Jianggezhuang, Kunyu County, Shandong Province, forty-eight of the fifty-two higher elementary school graduates participated in mutual aid teams, and two participated in agricultural production cooperatives. Many served as bookkeepers and newspaper readers in the teams and cooperatives, and some were elected as leaders of mutual aid teams, chairmen of cooperatives, and captains of production teams. At the same time, many have also become skilled workers in production. For example, among the thirty-nine higher elementary school graduates in Wangge Township, Pingdu County, thirty-one could hoe and harvest crops, twenty-three learned to plow, and five learned to sow.

Higher elementary school graduates have also played a significant role in other rural work. Many have served as teachers in people's schools and winter schools, and some have served as technicians in the general election. Some can also help the township government with autumn grain collection and statistical work. Many activists have also emerged in the general line propaganda. For example, in Erliujia Village, Penglai County, more than thirty higher elementary school graduates, under the leadership of the Youth League branch, organized three propaganda groups to publicize the general line and the people's government's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain to the local masses.

Because a large number of higher elementary school graduates have played an important role in production, social activities, and the promotion of advanced farming techniques, the people have generally expressed their support. Parents are very satisfied, and village cadres actively assist them. Many parents and masses in Erliujia Village, Penglai County, reflected: These children (referring to higher elementary school graduates engaged in production at home) are really likable. As long as they work hard, production will surely be stronger year by year! In the general election movement, some outstanding higher elementary school graduates were elected by the masses as township people's representatives and cadres. The support of public opinion has also greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of higher elementary school graduates in production and work. Some said: "Now, I truly realize the glory of labor."

While mobilizing higher elementary school graduates to participate in labor production, Shandong Province has also paid attention to actively solving their spare-time study problems. In cities, cultural supplementary schools and classes have been held to help them study their lessons. In rural areas, they have been organized to conduct spare-time studies to consolidate their learning achievements and continuously improve their cultural level, as well as their production and working abilities. Shandong Province has adopted a variety of learning organizational forms based on specific local conditions. Some areas have established self-study groups. This form is simple and easy to implement and can be adopted in areas where there are no conditions for running higher-level learning forms. Some places organize study rooms. This is a good form to unite and educate higher elementary school graduates and the broad masses of young people, enabling them to actively engage in spare-time studies, participate in rural work, conduct social propaganda activities, and carry out cultural and sports activities. Some villages have attached senior classes to relatively well-established people's schools. Some areas have established spare-time supplementary classes and schools. This is a relatively advanced learning group. This learning organization is more complex and can only be held in areas with considerable conditions.

The reason why Shandong Province has achieved greater success in organizing higher elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production is primarily due to the Party and governments at all levels patiently conducting ideological education on the glory of labor for them, helping them overcome their ideas of despising and not being at ease with agricultural production, and gradually establishing the idea that labor is glorious. The actual situation in various parts of Shandong Province proves that this is an arduous ideological education work. In the process of ideological education, on the one hand, it is necessary to explain to higher elementary school graduates the truth about the glory of labor, and on the other hand, it is necessary to organize them to participate in agricultural labor and rural social activities. The two must be closely combined and cannot be neglected.

Shandong Province's experience proves that it is also very important to educate students' parents and the broad masses, improve their understanding of agricultural production, change the mistaken view that "engaging in farming is not promising," and promote higher elementary school graduates to engage in agricultural labor from the perspective of social opinion. Many places held symposiums for students' parents to explain to parents the reasons why higher elementary school graduates cannot all continue their studies, and explain that participating in production is beneficial to the country and to individuals. Some adopted the method of visiting parents individually to conduct education, or used typical examples to publicize to parents. Some places conducted education for the general masses through various meetings and production and work activities. At the same time, various localities also used typical figures who have achieved considerable success in production to educate higher elementary school graduates, requiring them to learn from advanced figures. This method is not only concrete and vivid, but also has great persuasive power and appeal.

### 山东组织高小毕业生参加农业生产有成绩

    山东组织高小毕业生参加农业生产有成绩
    山东省各地在动员和组织高小毕业生参加农业生产和组织他们进行业余学习方面，取得了成绩和经验。
    去年暑期，在各级党委统一领导下，山东省大部分高小毕业生参加了农业劳动。他们在生产工作中提高了认识，加强了劳动观念，都表示要努力学习生产技术，增产粮食和工业原料，支援国家建设，争取社会主义的早日实现。山东省崐嵛县姜格庄五十二名高小毕业生有四十八名参加了互助组，两名参加了农业生产合作社。许多人在组内、社内担任了记账员、读报员，有的当选为互助组组长、合作社社长和生产队队长。同时，还有不少的人成为生产的能手。如平度县王哥乡三十九名高小毕业生，有三十一人能锄地、割庄稼，二十三人学会了耕地，五人学会了耩地。
    在农村其他各项工作中，高小毕业生也发挥了不少作用。许多人担任了民校和冬学的教师，有的在普选中担任了技术员。有些人还能帮助乡政府做秋征和统计工作。在总路线宣传中，也出现了不少的积极分子。如蓬莱县二刘家村三十多名高小毕业生，在青年团支部的领导下，组织三个宣传组向当地群众宣传了总路线和人民政府的粮食统购统销政策。
    由于大批高小毕业生在生产、社会活动以及推广先进耕作技术中起了重要的作用，人民群众普遍表示支持：家长们都很满意，而村干部们则积极予以协助。蓬莱县二刘家村的许多家长和群众反映：这伙孩子（指在家生产的高小毕业生）真叫人喜欢，只要好好干，生产准能一年比一年强！在普选运动中，一部分优秀的高小毕业生被群众选为乡人民代表和干部。社会舆论的支持，也大大地鼓励了高小毕业生们的生产和工作积极性。有的说：“现在，我真正体会到劳动的光荣。”
    在动员高小毕业生参加劳动生产的同时，山东省各地还注意积极解决他们的业余学习问题。在城市中，举办了文化补习学校和补习班，帮助他们学习功课；在农村中，组织他们进行业余学习，以巩固他们的学习成绩，并不断地提高文化水平，以及生产和工作能力。山东省各地根据具体情况，采取了多种多样的学习组织形式。有的地区成立了自学小组。这种形式简单易行，在没有条件举办较高级的学习形式的地区可以采用。有的地方组织学习室。这是团结和教育高小毕业生和广大青年，使他们积极从事业余学习、参加农村工作、进行社会宣传活动和开展文娱体育活动的良好形式。有的村子在较健全的民校中附设高级班。某些地区成立了业余补习班和补习学校。这是一种比较高级的学习组。这种学习组织比较复杂，只能在具有相当条件的地区举办。
    山东省在组织高小毕业生参加农业生产方面所以获得较大的成绩，首先是由于党和各级政府耐心地对他们进行了劳动光荣的思想教育，帮助他们克服轻视和不安心农业生产的思想，逐步树立起劳动光荣的思想。山东省各地实际情况证明：这是一件艰苦的思想教育工作。在思想教育过程中，一方面要向高小毕业生讲清劳动光荣的道理，一方面要组织他们参加农业劳动和农村社会活动。二者要密切结合起来，不能偏废。
    山东省的经验证明：对学生的家长和广大群众进行教育，提高他们对农业生产的认识，改变“干庄稼活没有出息”的错误看法，从社会舆论方面来推动高小毕业生投入农业劳动，这也是非常重要的。许多地方召开了学生家长座谈会，对家长们说明高小毕业生不能全部升学的原因，并说明参加生产对国家、对个人都有好处。有的采取访问的方式个别地向家长进行教育；或用典型的事例向家长进行宣传。有的地方通过各种会议和生产与工作活动对一般群众进行教育。同时各地还运用在生产上取得相当成绩的典型人物，对高小毕业生进行教育，要求他们向先进人物学习。这种方式不但具体生动，而且富有极大的说服力和感染力。
