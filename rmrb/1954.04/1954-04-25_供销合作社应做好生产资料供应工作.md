Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Do a Good Job in Supplying Means of Production
Wang Nianji, Deputy Director of the Supply Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives

One of the basic tasks of cooperative commerce in rural areas is to support farmers in developing production and increasing the output of grain and industrial raw material crops to meet the needs of national industrialization. Doing a good job in supplying means of production is the central link in completing this task. This year, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country generally attach importance to the supply of means of production, as demonstrated in the following points.

First, the proportion of means of production managed by cooperatives has increased. According to statistics from cooperatives in the Central South and Northwest regions, as well as Liaodong, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Rehe provinces, the proportion of means of production has risen from about 12% of the total supply to about 20%.

Second, among the means of production managed by cooperatives, the proportion of small farm tools has increased rapidly. The total value of the national supply plan for old-fashioned farm tools this year exceeds last year by about 70%. There are no fewer than 120 million pieces of old-fashioned farm tools, large and small. This shows that the policy of "taking materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally" is being implemented. Millions upon millions of handicraftsmen are being linked with supply and marketing cooperatives in various places.

Third, in the business of managing fertilizers, the proportion of soybean cake has decreased, while the proportion of miscellaneous cakes and miscellaneous fertilizers has increased. For example, with 1952 as 100, in 1953 soybean cake was 76, miscellaneous cake was 237, and miscellaneous fertilizer was 205; in 1954 soybean cake was 80, miscellaneous cake was 280, and miscellaneous fertilizer was 775. This is in line with the policy of "local fertilizer as the main source, commercial fertilizer as a supplement." Because the production of soybean cake and chemical fertilizers cannot keep up with the demand, this situation will exist for a considerable period. Therefore, it is one of the important ways to solve the current fertilizer difficulties for cooperatives to actively explore the sources of local miscellaneous fertilizers.

Fourth, the variety of means of production managed has increased. Over the past three years, cooperatives in various places have focused on managing fertilizers, and this year the proportion of fertilizer management still occupies an important position. At the same time, the number of new and old farm tools, livestock, seeds, carts, and horse tools managed has increased significantly compared with previous years. This shows that the scope of cooperative management of means of production has been newly expanded.

Fifth, the preparation time for the supply of means of production this year started earlier. In the fourth quarter of last year, cooperatives in various places had already started preparations. Since the first quarter of this year, many cooperatives have sent inspection teams to the countryside and transported the prepared materials to the sales sites to support spring plowing and production. The phenomenon of "goods not arriving when the season arrives" in the past has been changed to a certain extent.

The better supply of means of production in various places this year is due to a lot of organizational work done in advance. First of all, in the winter of last year, various places started to investigate the needs of farmers, studied the requirements of different regions and different habits, and initially formulated a plan for organizing the source of goods. Cooperative business meetings were held at each level, during which the experience of supplying means of production was summarized, and some erroneous ideas were criticized. Then, representative meetings or professional meetings or commodity exhibitions were held at the county or township level, with the participation of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, individual farmers, handicraft production cooperatives, individual handicraftsmen, and local state-owned commercial departments to communicate production and sales information, appraise specifications and quality, and resolve some issues related to the division of labor and relationships among various parties. Finally, some supply and marketing cooperatives signed combination contracts with farmers, and various contracts such as processing, ordering, guaranteed sales, and cash purchases with producers. Subsequently, the federations of cooperatives at all levels organized many purchasing groups to go to the production areas to purchase large quantities of livestock, as well as ironware, woodwork, bamboo ware, and raw materials. Many grassroots cooperatives have established specialized sales departments for supplying means of production, organized many farm tool repair stations, and used mobile methods to repair various farm tools and furniture for farmers. Generally, they can be made solid and cheap, which is very popular among farmers. Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are organizing small-scale farm tool exchange fairs and livestock exchange fairs with the participation of private merchants in the rural primary markets, using temple fairs and market days to further activate the rural market and strive to supply farmers with more means of production.

In the work of supplying means of production in various places, there are still many serious shortcomings and problems that need to be studied and resolved.

First, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have not yet recognized the important significance of supply and marketing cooperatives serving agriculture. The capitalist management thinking of being troublesome, unable to make money, and even afraid of losing money still seriously exists. In some areas, the proportion of means of production management is still very small, some less than 10% of the total business management; some only manage fertilizers and rarely manage small farm tools; some sales departments display three or five kinds of small farm tools, but only as a formality. These situations show that the development of the supply of means of production is still uneven, and in some areas, it has not been seriously managed, which should be corrected quickly.

Second, the new businesses that have already been operated should be closely checked and summarized to consolidate the existing achievements and improve the policy level and business level. For example, the experience of combination contracts, the experience of organizing the source of goods, the experience of managing livestock, and the experience gained from reforming toothmarks and private merchants must be checked and summarized in a timely manner. For example, in the processing and ordering of handicrafts, it has now been found that the product quality in many places is very low. Some large carts make creaking noises when loaded with things, and farmers reflect that "cooperative carts can carry things and sing"; some ax steels are uneven in hardness, or the ax blade has two layers of skin, and it splits open as soon as it is used. Some farmers say, "This is made of tofu dregs." In order to improve product quality, farmers can be organized to visit farm tool exhibitions, handicraftsmen can be organized to check and compare with each other, model banners can be established, and the inspection system should be strictly implemented. This is an important task, and various places have preliminary experience in this regard, which should be improved and promoted.

Third, it is necessary to continue to study the purchasing power, purchasing habits, and new changes in the needs for varieties and quantities of farmers, and constantly and correctly grasp these characteristics and laws to do a good job in rural purchase and sales work. Everyone knows that since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the production enthusiasm of farmers has been greatly improved, and the proportion of means of production they need has also increased accordingly, and the purchase and sale season has also been advanced compared with the past. This is a new change. This new situation is still developing. This requires our work to continue to keep up, otherwise the work will become blind or fall into passivity. Now some allocations of materials have shown this phenomenon, such as some areas that do not need to promote chemical fertilizers have also been transferred to them; hard land and muddy land have also been transferred to step plows; some farmers need small donkeys and calves, but what we send are large mules and horses. Conversely, some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups need mules and horses but cannot buy them. These unreasonable phenomena are all caused by not having a clear picture in mind. Therefore, it is very important to grasp the changes in the purchase and sale requirements of farmers at all times and try to reduce the blindness of business.

Fourth, for some important commodities that are in short supply, it is necessary to strengthen the planning in the supply work. For example, the shortage of commercial fertilizers cannot be solved in the short term, so it is necessary to explain this clearly to farmers and explain that the current supply principle of commercial fertilizers is: to ensure the production of grain and industrial raw materials; to supply organized agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups first, and to appropriately take care of poor and fertilizer-deficient individual households, and then to general fertilizer-deficient farmers; places where it is not necessary to promote should not be promoted for the time being, but farmers are allowed to use oil cake to feed pigs and accumulate fertilizer. And organize the masses to conduct democratic appraisal and distribution according to this principle. Experience has proved that this approach can ensure the increase in the production of grain and industrial raw materials needed by the state, and can avoid unreasonable phenomena in supply. If the distribution is mechanically distributed by township, village, and household, it will cause a lot of waste and disputes, not only deviating from production, but also deviating from the masses.

Fifth, in carrying out the combination contract work, it is necessary to ensure the healthy development of this work. Many supply and marketing cooperatives have widely signed combination contracts with farmers, which is good. However, attention should be paid to the material basis of both parties. If the contract is only signed based on subjective wishes, for the sake of combination, and purely pursuing figures, the result will be coercion and command or become a formality, deviating from the masses.

Sixth, in terms of operating methods, the enthusiasm of lower-level societies, especially grassroots societies and county societies, should be brought into full play. The upper-level societies should do more work in organizing business, checking policies, and summarizing experience. Where the price is high and the grassroots society is not strong enough, it can be operated by the county society; while the general ones, which the grassroots society can take materials locally, the county society should help it overcome difficulties and enable the grassroots society to exert its strength and operate on its own. Some county societies almost contract all the handicraftsmen, and even the handicraft products in the location of the grassroots society must go through the county society before they can be obtained, which not only restricts the enthusiasm of the grassroots society to take materials locally, process locally, and supply locally, but also increases the cost of goods, and at the same time, it is difficult to meet the requirements of farmers in terms of specifications and habits, which is inappropriate. Of course, in some areas, because handicraftsmen are concentrated in important market towns or large and medium-sized cities, it is necessary for the federations of cooperatives above the county level to uniformly control the source of goods.

    供销合作社应做好生产资料供应工作
    全国合作总社供应局副局长　王念基
    合作社商业在农村中的基本任务之一，是要支持农民发展生产，增加粮食和工业原料作物的产量，以适应国家工业化建设的需要，而做好生产资料的供应工作，则是完成这一任务的中心环节。今年全国各地合作社对生产资料的供应一般是重视的，这表现在以下几点。
    一、合作社经营生产资料的比重提高。据中南、西北两区及辽东、黑龙江、河北、山西、江苏、热河等省合作社统计，生产资料已由过去占供应总额的百分之十二左右上升到百分之二十左右。
    二、在合作社经营的生产资料中，小农具的比重上升较快。全国今年旧式农具供应计划总值超过去年百分之七十左右。旧式农具大小不下一亿二千多万件。这就说明了“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的方针正在贯彻。千千万万的手工业者正在与各地供销合作社挂上了钩。
    三、在经营肥料业务中，豆饼比重下降，杂饼、杂肥上升。如以一九五二年各为一○○，则一九五三年豆饼是七十六，杂饼是二三七，杂肥是二○五；一九五四年豆饼是八十，杂饼是二八○，杂肥是七七五。这是符合于“地方肥料为主，商品肥料为辅”的方针的。因为豆饼与化学肥料的生产赶不上需要的情况，将在相当长期内存在，因此，合作社积极开拓地方杂肥的来源，是解决当前肥料困难的重要办法之一。
    四、经营生产资料的品种增加了。三年来各地合作社着重经营了肥料，今年肥料经营的比重，也仍占着重要的位置。但同时对新、旧式农具、牲口、种籽、车马用具等等，比往年的经营数量增加了许多。这说明合作社经营生产资料的范围有了新的扩展。
    五、今年生产资料供应的准备工作时间开始较早。在去年第四季度，各地合作社即已着手进行准备。从今年第一季度开始，许多合作社就派检查组下乡，并将准备好的物资运至销货现场，支持春耕生产。过去“季到货不来”的现象，已有了一定程度的改变。
    今年各地生产资料供应工作较好，这是由于事前作了不少组织工作。首先是各地在去年冬季即着手进行了对农民需要的调查工作，研究了不同地区、不同习惯的要求，初步制定了组织货源的计划。逐级召开了合作社业务会议，在会议中，总结了生产资料供应工作的经验，并批判了若干错误的思想。而后又以县或以乡为单位召开了有农业生产合作社、互助组、个体农民、手工业生产合作社、个体手工业以及当地国营商业部门参加的代表会议或专业会议，或商品展览会，沟通产销情况，鉴定规格质量，解决了若干有关各方面的相互间的分工与关系问题。最后有些供销合作社与农民订立结合合同，与生产者的加工、订货、包销现购等各种合同。接着各级联社又组织了许多采购组赴产地采购大批的牲口以及铁器、木器、竹器和原料。许多基层社业已建立了供应生产资料的专业门市部，组织了许多农具修理站，采用流动方式，为农民修补各种农具、家具，一般的可以做到结实便宜，很受农民欢迎。最近各地供销合作社正在农村初级市场，利用庙会、集日组织有私商参加的小型农具交流会、牲口交流会等等，以进一步活跃农村市场，争取供应农民更多的生产资料。
    在各地生产资料供应工作中，目前还严重地存在着许多缺点和问题，需要加以研究和解决。
    第一、有些供销合作社干部，还没有认识供销合作为农业服务的重要意义，嫌麻烦、嫌赚不了钱甚至怕赔钱的资本主义经营思想仍严重存在。若干地区生产资料经营比重还很小，有的不到业务经营总额的百分之十；有的只是经营肥料，对小农具很少经营；有的门市部虽摆出了三、五种小农具，也只是摆摆样子而已。这些情况说明：生产资料供应工作发展还不平衡，在有些地区还没有认真经营，这是应该迅速改正的。
    第二、已经经营的新业务，要抓紧检查和总结，以巩固既得的成绩，和提高政策水平与业务水平。譬如结合合同的经验、组织货源的经验、经营牲口的经验，以及由此而取得对改造牙纪私商的经验，都须及时加以检查总结。又如对手工业的加工订货，现已发现不少地方的产品质量很低。有的大车一载上东西就压得吱吱喳喳叫，农民反映：“合作社的大车又能拉东西，又会唱歌”；有的斧头钢口软硬不匀，或者斧刃两层皮，一使就劈开，有的农民说：“这是豆腐渣做的。”为了提高产品质量，可以组织农民参观农具展览会，组织手工业者相互检查评比，树立模范旗帜，严格执行检验制度。这是一项重要的任务，在这方面各地已有初步经验，应注意提高和推广。
    第三、要继续研究农民的购买力、购买习惯以及对品种、数量需要的新变化，不断正确地掌握这些特点和规律，做好农村购销工作。大家知道，自实行粮食统购统销后，农民的生产积极性大大提高，他们需要生产资料的比重也随之增长，购销季节也较过去提前，这是一个新的变化。这个新的情况还在发展。这就需要我们的工作继续跟上去，否则工作就会造成盲目或陷于被动。现在有些物资的调拨已出现了这种现象，如有些地区不需要推广化学肥料的也调了去；硬土地、泥水地也调去了步犁；有的农民需要小驴小牛，而我们送去的却是大骡大马。相反的，有些农业生产合作社、互助组需要骡马倒买不到。这些不合理的现象都是由于心中无数所造成，因此，时刻掌握农民购销要求的变化，尽量减少业务的盲目性，是十分重要的。
    第四、对有些生产不足的重要商品，要加强供应工作中的计划性。如商品肥料的缺乏，在短期内仍无法解决，这就必须向农民讲清楚，并说明目前商品肥料的供应原则是：以保证粮食和工业原料生产为主；先供应组织起来的农业生产合作社、互助组，并适当照顾贫苦缺肥的单干户，然后到一般缺肥农民；没有必要推广的地方暂时不推广，但允许农民以油饼喂猪积肥。并根据这一原则组织群众进行民主评议分配。经验证明，这种做法既可保证国家需要的粮食和工业原料的增产，又能避免供应上的不合理现象。如果机械地按乡按村按户平均摊派，就会造成许多浪费和纠纷，不仅脱离了生产，也脱离了群众。
    第五、在开展结合合同工作中，要保证这项工作健康地发展。许多供销合作社广泛地与农民订立结合合同，这是好的。但要注意双方的物质基础，如果只是凭主观愿望去订，为结合而结合，单纯追求数字，结果会发生强迫命令或流于形式，脱离群众。
    第六、在经营方式上，应尽量发挥下级社尤其是基层社和县社的积极性，上级社应多做组织业务、检查政策、总结经验的工作。凡是价钱大、基层社力量不足的，可以由县社经营；而一般的、基层社可以就地取材的，县社应帮助其克服困难，使基层社发挥力量自行经营。有的县社几乎把全部手工业者包下来，甚至基层社所在地的手工业产品也要经过县社才能拿到，这不仅限制了基层社就地取材、就地加工、就地供应的积极性，也增加了商品的成本，同时还很难满足农民规格习惯上的要求，这是不妥当的。当然，有些地区由于手工业者集中在重要的集镇或大中城市，在这种情况下，由县以上的联社统一控制货源是十分必要的。
