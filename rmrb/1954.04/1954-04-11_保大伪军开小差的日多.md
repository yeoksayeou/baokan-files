Xinhua News Agency Report:

    According to Vietnam's "Save the Nation Newspaper," under the influence of the Vietnamese government's lenient policy and the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Army, from December 19, last year, to February 2, this year, more than two thousand Bao Dai puppet soldiers in the middle reaches of the Red River either deserted or surrendered to the People's Army.

    In Bac Ninh province, three companies of puppet soldiers refused to accept orders to go and reinforce operations, and two of these companies deserted. Puppet soldiers stationed at Minh Hong in Quang Yen province, Tu Son in Bac Ninh province, and An Trai in Vinh Phuc province either killed their French commanders or destroyed their strongholds and then defected to the People's Army with their weapons. In mid-February of this year, eight hundred puppet soldiers stationed at the Van Mieu stronghold in the capital of Quang Yen province successively surrendered to the People's Army or fled home.

    在北宁省，有三连伪军拒绝接受派去增援作战的命令，其中有两连人开了小差。广安省明鸿、北宁省慈山、永福省安次等据点的伪军，有的杀死了法国指挥官或者破坏了据点，然后携带武器投向人民军。今年二月中旬，广安省省会的文庙据点有伪军八百人相继向人民军投降或逃跑回家。
