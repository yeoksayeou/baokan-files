In some areas of Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi Province, winter wheat has been found to be infested with wheat spider mites. Local cadres at all levels are actively mobilizing farmers to carry out prevention and control. In individual areas where action was taken earlier, the pests have been basically eradicated. After the outbreak of the insect pests, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government immediately notified all localities to conduct timely inspections, make early preparations, and vigorously carry out prevention and control. Party and government leaders in counties and districts with insect pests also issued urgent circulars, requiring cadres at all levels to complete the active mobilization of the masses to prevent and control insect pests as a crash task. Cadres of Sucun Township in the Fifth District of Dali, upon discovering wheat spider mites in wheat fields, immediately consulted with the local agricultural technology guidance station to develop pest control methods. That evening, they convened a mass meeting to conduct publicity and mobilization. As a result, the entire township weeded 30 mu and harrowed and rolled over 800 mu of land in two days. Now, most of the insect pests have been eradicated. The farmers who have been organized in various places, after discovering insect pests, first allocated labor and took the lead in prevention and control. This not only ensured that the crops of their own cooperative and team were protected from losses, but also motivated the surrounding masses to jointly carry out prevention and control, playing a demonstrative and educational role. The Donglijia Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luqiao, Yang County, had two mu of wheat fields severely infested with pests. The cooperative immediately assigned special personnel to carry out prevention and control, and the pests were quickly eradicated. The Wu Gao Mutual Aid Team in Qian'dian Township, Seventh District of Shanyang County, mobilized eleven team members and controlled pests on seven mu in one morning, thereby motivating the nearby masses to carry out pest control work.

    陕西省南部部分地区发生虫害
    当地干部农民积极进行防治
    陕西省关中及陕南部分地区冬小麦发现麦蜘蛛为害，当地各级干部积极发动农民进行防治，个别动手较早的地区，已基本扑灭了害虫。虫害发生后，陕西省人民政府农林厅即通知各地及时检查，早作准备，大力防治。有虫害地区的县区党、政领导，根据虫害发生情况，也发出紧急通报，要求各级干部把积极发动群众防治虫害，当作一项突击工作来完成。大荔五区苏村乡干部，发现麦田有麦蜘蛛时，立即和当地农业技术指导站研究出治虫办法，当晚即召开群众大会，作了宣传动员，结果全乡两天就锄草三十亩，耱、碾地共八百多亩，现在大部虫害已被扑灭。各地组织起来的农民，在发现虫害后，首先调配劳力，带头防治，这样不仅保证本社、本组庄稼免受损失，而且带动了周围群众，共同防治，发挥了示范教育作用。洋县鲁桥东李家农业生产合作社，有二亩麦田虫害很严重，该社立即抽出专人防治，很快就把害虫扑灭了。山阳县七区前店乡吴高互助组发动了十一名组员，一个早晨就防治了七亩虫害，因而，带动了附近群众开展了防虫工作。
