    Shanxi Province's Experience and Gains in Organizing Industrial Products Exhibition
    Pei Lisheng, Chairman of Shanxi Provincial People's Government
    In order to fully supply the vast rural population with industrial products after the planned grain purchase and during the Spring Festival, Shanxi Province organized a large-scale industrial product exhibition and sales event throughout the province, combining economic and political work, and promotion and exhibition. In this industrial product exhibition and sales event, a large number of cadres, rural reporters, propagandists, and theater performers were mobilized, and propaganda tools such as slides, radios, phonographs, megaphones, and blackboards were used to penetrate remote mountainous areas and rural areas throughout the province. In just over twenty days, the state-owned commercial enterprises in the province overfulfilled the January sales targets for several major commodities, and the supply and marketing cooperatives in the province also completed 56.7% of the quarterly sales plan for January. Through this industrial product exhibition and sales event, not only were the industrial product needs of farmers throughout the province met for celebrating the Spring Festival, but also new avenues were opened for promoting industrial products in rural areas in the future.
    The main experiences and gains of this industrial product exhibition and sales event are:
    1.  In this exhibition and sales event, cadres in various regions were informed of the significant political and economic importance of this industrial product exhibition and sales event in meeting farmers' demands for industrial products, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for building socialism. Criticism was also directed towards conservative thinking in industrial product promotion. This was the key to the success of this industrial product exhibition and sales event. At the beginning of the promotion work, various regions encountered varying degrees of resistance from conservative thinking and empiricism. The most common was a lack of understanding of the new living needs of farmers that are growing with production development. Some comrades did not believe that farmers would buy glossy paper for windows, saying that farmers would find glossy paper expensive, dazzling, and not durable. In fact, farmers, after calculation, believed that glossy paper was cheaper, brighter, and more resistant to wind and sand than hemp paper. Some even thought that it was "wasteful" for farmers to wear some colorful cloth and make new quilts, and did not see the growing living needs of farmers based on the development of production. In response to the above ideas, various regions carried out a series of persuasion and mobilization efforts. When the masses welcomed trade workers with enthusiastic purchases of industrial products, the various erroneous perceptions of cadres in various regions were further changed. It can be said that the process of large-scale sales of industrial products is also the process of overcoming conservative thinking in trade work.
    2.  In this industrial product exhibition and sales event, cadres and trade workers in various regions brought industrial products to remote mountainous areas and the vast rural population with a high degree of service to the people, fully embodying the essence of people's trade work, and were warmly welcomed by the vast rural population. Before the Spring Festival, snow fell everywhere, and many promotion teams went to the countryside with goods in the snow, and even went deep into places that no merchants had ever been to, such as the promotion team in Hunyuan County climbing the Qiaomai River Village on the south side of Hengshan Mountain, which is 3,800 meters above sea level, and the promotion team in Huairen County going deep into the Maying Village, where there are "120 bends up and down the mountain, and even hawkers don't go." When the farmers of Qiaomai River Village in Hunyuan County saw the arrival of the promotion team, they helped to carry goods, clean the place, set up tables and chairs, and display goods. When the promotion team left, Li Xiuying, the female director of the agricultural production cooperative, led more than 20 people to carry goods for more than ten miles. The farmers of Luan Yao Village in Datong County said: "Our village lives behind Yin Mountain. If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, no one would have sent us such good goods in tens of thousands of years." Ma Erlian, a labor model in the village, said: "In the old society, water in the twelfth lunar month was more expensive by three points. Now the government reduces the price of beloved goods and delivers them to our doorsteps, which is really rare." The masses in Yaozhuang, Linjin County, said: "In the past, celebrating the New Year was about hiding from debts and escaping for our lives. Now, celebrating the New Year is about buying goods at the door." More importantly, through the exhibition and sales, the vast population also realized that the business of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives is truly: "Genuine goods at fair prices, no deception for the old or young," thereby enhancing their understanding of socialist commerce.
    3.  In the context of underdeveloped industry and transportation and the lack of a widespread new trade network between urban and rural areas, seizing the opportunity of large demand for goods in rural areas, with planned preparation to go deep into remote mountainous areas and rural areas, and adopting the method of industrial product exhibition and sales, so that the vast rural population can directly see industrial products, is a better method to expand the rural market, and an effective method to close the relationship between workers and farmers, industry and agriculture, and cities and villages. Transportation in Shanxi Province is inconvenient, and it is very difficult for the masses to go to the city for the market. The phenomenon of having money but not being able to buy industrial products is widespread. In particular, women feel this pain more deeply. They said: "In the past, buying some goods was always entrusted to men. If they didn't buy it for me, they would buy something that didn't suit my mind. Now I can choose it myself." In the past, general market towns only had thirty or forty kinds of goods. This time, each promotion team brought five or six hundred kinds of goods, at most, and more than one hundred kinds, at least, with an average of three or four hundred kinds, which made the masses feel very rich. For example, the farmers of Maying Village in Huairen County, Yanbei Prefecture, could not buy paint in the past. Men used buckwheat husk ash to dye coarse cloth gray to make clothes, and women used sorghum stalk ash to dye coarse cloth light red to make clothes. The clothes people wore only had the so-called "white-gray" and "red-gray" two colors. Now they bought many blue serge, khaki, and colored cloth, and even bought six thermos bottles, which farmers had never used for generations. Lan Zenggui's wife from Qiaomai River, Hunyuan County, looked at the industrial products on display and said: "It's really good! It's getting better year by year. This year (referring to 1953) we just started planned construction, and seven camels brought us so many goods. If industry develops in a few more years, there will be more goods. I must mobilize the whole family to join the agricultural production cooperative, work hard to produce, increase income, and prepare to buy more and better industrial products." Farmers in Qi County and other regions, after this exhibition and sales and according to the spirit of the general line widely publicized the worker-peasant alliance, reflected: "All kinds of industrial products are manufactured by the working class. In the future, they will manufacture agricultural machinery to support us. We must do a good job in agricultural production to support the working class big brother."
      4. State-owned commercial cooperatives have been commercially consistent, improved their business management, and made trade work a step forward. Cadres of Datong Department Store took the initiative to help the Nantun Village grassroots cooperative improve the display of goods, completely displaying the goods that were previously placed in cardboard boxes, using handkerchiefs to weave five-pointed stars, and using socks to weave the word "cooperative", and also helped establish clear price tags, patiently publicizing and explaining to customers during the promotion. The director of the cooperative said: "Any goods sell quickly when they get into your hands. We must learn from you in the future." The business management of state-owned commercial enterprises themselves has also been improved. In the past, Datong Department Store distributed no more than 200 million yuan of goods every day. In this exhibition and sales, it rationally organized the price, allocation, accounting, and storage and transportation departments to work together, reduced procedures, and stipulated systems. Within five hours, it distributed more than 1,000 kinds of goods worth 974.7 million yuan, and met the needs of various places in Yanbei to allocate goods in a timely manner. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in Yuncheng Prefecture unified the ranking of goods, clarified their inventories, and actively contacted each other closely, sending and receiving goods from each other, reversing the previous situation of some out of stock and some overstocked, without mutual support and mutual contact. When equipping goods for grassroots cooperatives and promotion teams, Yongji County Cooperative paid attention to equipping different goods according to the different habits and requirements of each village. In addition, some regions held meetings of the board of directors, supervisors, and members' representatives of grassroots cooperatives. Transactions were made at the meeting or the needs of members were counted at the meeting, and goods were delivered after the meeting, giving play to the superiority of the grassroots cooperative's organization. On January 18th, the Cao Zhang Town grassroots cooperative in Xia County convened a meeting of members' representatives from 27 villages under its jurisdiction, proposing a total value of 117.5 million yuan of required goods. As soon as the promotion team arrived, they quickly completed the promotion task.
    5. All localities paid attention to correctly utilizing urban and rural private retailers, wholesalers, and peddlers, and correctly playing their initiative. The Datong Department Store organized three consecutive symposiums for the private department store, stationery, and grocery industries. Combining the publicity of the general line, they dispelled the ideological concerns of the private merchants. Immediately, 150 retailers proposed a plan to order goods from the Datong Department Store with a total value of 2.347 billion yuan in the first quarter. In addition, more than 90 peddlers and merchants who traveled between urban and rural areas selling candies, towels, socks, and porcelain were organized. Not only expanded the business of state-owned commercial enterprises, but also met the needs of the masses. Yanggao, Hunyuan, Pinglu, Lingqiu, Xinjiang and other counties also convened private merchant symposiums, greatly stimulating their enthusiasm for promoting industrial products.
    The industrial products exhibition and sales campaign achieved great results, but there are still some problems, mainly: the time was short, and the leadership's arrangements were a little late. Some regions did not organize enough forces, and the selection of promotion points was inappropriate; trade departments did not understand the needs of farmers; there were shortcomings in the organization of work, forming a situation where people arrived but the goods did not, and the goods arrived but the price did not; the supply of means of subsistence was better, and the supply of means of production and food was worse, and so on. Therefore, the masses reflected: "You came late, and we have already spent the money from selling grain. You should come earlier in the future."
    Based on the above situation, we plan to pay attention to the following points in the future:
    1. In the future, we should seize the time before the rural summer harvest, autumn harvest, and Spring Festival every year, and organize three to four industrial product exhibitions and sales events in remote mountainous areas and rural areas in a planned and prepared manner, so that industrial products can directly meet with farmers, in order to meet their growing needs, inspire and stimulate their high enthusiasm for loving socialist industrialization, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and close the relationship between urban and rural areas, and close the relationship between the Party and the government and the people.
    2. In the case of inconvenient transportation and the small number of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative institutions, small number of personnel, and a severe lack of commodity display rooms, leaders at all levels must provide support in order to mobilize the masses, comprehensively start work, overcome various difficulties in promotion, and promote trade workers to improve their business management and better serve the people. At the same time, according to the correct needs of the masses, promote industrial departments to increase product varieties and improve product quality.
    3. The correct utilization, restriction, and transformation of private retailers, wholesalers, and peddlers must continue to be strengthened, and experience must be created.

    山西省组织工业品展览的经验和收获
    山西省人民政府主席　裴丽生
    为了充分供应广大农村人民在粮食计划收购以后和春节期间对于工业品的需要，在山西省全省范围内组织了一次规模大、品种多、经济工作与政治工作相结合、推销与展览相结合的工业品展览推销。在这次工业品展览推销中，曾动员了大批干部及农村报告员、宣传员、剧团演员，运用了幻灯、收音机、留声机、广播筒、黑板报等宣传工具，深入全省偏僻山区和农村。在短短二十多天内，使全省国营商业所经营的几种大宗的商品，都超额完成了一月份的销售任务，全省供销合作社一月份也完成了季度推销计划的百分之五六点七。经过这次工业品展览推销，不仅满足了全省农民欢度春节的工业品的需要，也为今后在农村中推销工业品开辟了新的途径。
    这次工业品展览推销的主要经验与收获是：
    一、在这次展览推销中，各地都向参加展览推销工作的干部说明了这次工业品展览推销，具有满足农民工业品要求，巩固工农联盟，鼓舞群众建设社会主义热情的重大政治意义与经济意义，并向工业品推销中的保守思想展开了批判，这是这次工业品展览推销成功的关键。各地在推销工作开始时，都遇到了程度不同的保守思想与经验主义的阻力。最普遍的是对于农民随着生产发展而日益增长的新的生活需要不了解。有些同志对农民买有光纸糊窗子不相信，说农民嫌有光纸贵、晃眼、不耐用；实际上农民经过计算之后，认为有光纸比麻纸便宜、明亮、风沙也吹不坏。甚至有些人还认为农民穿些花布、盖新被子是“浪费”，而没有看到农民在生产发展的基础上日益增长的生活需要。针对上述思想，各地都进行了一系列的说服动员工作，当群众用热烈购买工业品的行动欢迎贸易工作人员时，就更进一步地改变了各地干部的各种错误认识。可以说，工业品大量推销的过程也就是克服贸易工作的保守思想的过程。
    二、在这次工业品展览推销中，各地干部与贸易工作人员以高度为人民服务的精神把工业品送到偏僻山区与广大农村人民面前，充分体现了人民贸易工作的本质，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。春节前各地普遍降雪，许多推销组的工作同志都冒雪带货下乡，而且深入到从来没有商人去过的地方，如浑源县推销组攀登拔海三千八百公尺的恒山南侧的荞麦川村，怀仁县推销组深入到“山上山下一百二十个湾，连货郎担也不去”的马营村等。浑源县荞麦川的农民，看推销组一到，就帮助搬运货物，打扫地方，摆设桌凳，陈列货物，推销组离开时，农业生产合作社女社长李秀英等带领二十多人背货送了十多里路。大同县乱垚村的农民说：“咱村住在阴山背后，不是毛主席和共产党，再过几万年也不会有人给咱送这样好的货来。”该村劳动模范马二莲说：“旧社会腊月的水还要贵三分，现在政府把心爱的货减价送上门，真是稀罕事。”临晋县姚庄的群众说：“过去过年是躲债逃命，现在过年是在门上买货。”更重要的，经过展览推销，还使广大人民体会到：国营商业和合作社的买卖真正是：“货真价实，童叟无欺”，从而提高了对社会主义商业的认识。
    三、在工业与交通还不发展、城乡新的贸易网还没有广泛地建立起来的情况下，抓紧农村大量需货时节有计划有准备地深入偏僻山区和农村，采取工业品展览推销办法，使广大农民直接与工业品见面，是扩大农村市场的一个较好方法，是密切工人与农民，工业与农业，城市与乡村的联系的有效方法。山西省内交通不便，群众赶集进城很困难，有钱买不到工业品的现象普遍存在。特别是妇女感到这个痛苦更深。她们说：“过去买些货，都是托男人捎的，不是不给买，就是买的不合心思。这一下可以亲手选择了。”过去一般集镇也只有三、四十种货，这次下乡各推销组带的货多的五、六百种，少的一百余种，平均达三、四百种，这就使群众感到非常丰富了。比如雁北专区怀仁县的马营村农民，过去买不到颜料，男人用荞麦皮灰把土布染成灰色做衣服，女人用高粱秆灰把土布染成淡红色做衣服，人们穿的衣服只有所谓“白灰”和“红灰”两样颜色，现在却买了许多青蓝哔叽、卡叽和花布，连农民世世代代未用过的热水瓶也卖了六个。浑源县荞麦川兰增贵的老婆看了展览推销的工业品说：“真好！一年比一年好了，今年（指一九五三年）刚开始有计划的建设，就有七头骆驼给咱们送来这么多的货，要是再过几年，工业发达了，货就更多了。我一定要动员全家参加农业生产合作社，努力生产，增加收入，准备买更多更好的工业品。”祁县等地区的农民，经过这次展览推销和根据总路线精神广泛宣传工农联盟后，纷纷反映：“各式各样的工业品都是工人阶级制造出来的，将来还要制造农业机器支援咱们，一定要搞好农业生产，支援工人老大哥。”
      四、国营商业合作社商业协同一致，改善了经营管理，使贸易工作前进一步。大同百货公司干部主动帮助南屯村基层社改善商品陈列，把以前放在纸盒内的商品完全摆出来，用手绢编成五角星，用袜子编成“合作社”字样，又帮助建立了明码标价，推销中耐心地向顾主宣传解释。该社主任说：“什么商品到你们手里就卖的快了，以后可得向你们学习。”而国营商业本身的经营管理也改善了。大同百货公司过去每天配发商品最多不超过两亿元，这次展览推销中合理地组织了物价、调拨、会计、储运各股联合办公，减少了手续，规定了制度，在五小时内即配发了商品一千余种价值九亿七千余万元，并满足了雁北各地及时调拨货物的要求。运城专区国营商业与合作社统一进行了商品排队，摸清了家底，并主动密切联系，相互送货取货，扭转了以往有的脱销有的积压，互不支援互不联系的情况。永济县社在为基层社和推销组配备商品时，注意了能按各个村庄的不同习惯和不同要求，配备不同的商品。此外，有的地区召开基层社理、监事及社员代表会议，会上进行成交或会上统计社员的需要，会后送货，发挥了基层社组织起来的优越性。夏县曹张镇基层社，一月十八日召开了所属二十七个村的社员代表会，提出所需商品价值共一亿一千七百五十万元，推销组一到，便很快完成了推销任务。
    五、各地都注意了正确利用城乡私营零售商、批发商、贩运商，正确发挥他们的积极性。大同百货公司对私营百货、文具、杂货三个行业，连续组织了三次座谈会，结合总路线的宣传，解除了私商的思想顾虑，当即有一百五十户零售商向大同百货公司提出一季度要货总值二十三亿四千七百万元的计划。此外，还组织了往来城乡间贩卖水果糖、毛巾、袜子、磁器的货郎担和商贩九十多个。不但扩大了国营商业的业务，而且满足了群众的需要。阳高、浑源、平鲁、灵邱、新绛等县，也都召开了私商座谈会，大大激发了他们推销工业品的积极性。
    这次工业品展览推销运动成绩是很大的，但仍存在一些问题，主要是：时间短，领导上布置稍晚了一些。有些地区组织力量不够，选择推销点不当；贸易部门对农民的需要了解不够；组织工作有缺点，形成人到货不到、货到价不到；对生活资料供应较好，对生产资料和粮食等供应较差等等。因此，群众反映说：“你们来晚了，出卖粮食的钱我们已经花了，以后可要早来。”
    基于上述情况，我们拟在今后注意下列各点：
    一、今后每年应抓紧农村夏收、秋收及春节前的时间，有计划有准备地组织三至四次深入偏僻山区和农村的工业品展览推销，使工业品能与农民直接见面，以满足他们日益增长的需要，鼓舞与激发他们热爱社会主义工业化的高度热情，进一步巩固工农联盟和密切城乡关系，密切党与政府和人民的联系。
    二、在交通不便和国营商业与合作社的机构小、人员少、商品陈设房舍十分缺乏的情况下，各级领导必须给予支持，才能发动群众，全面动手，克服推销中的各种困难，并推动贸易工作人员改善经营管理，更好地为人民服务，同时根据群众的正确需要，推动工业部门增加产品种类，改进产品质量。
    三、对私营零售商、批发商、贩卖商的正确利用、限制、改造，须继续加强，并创造经验。
