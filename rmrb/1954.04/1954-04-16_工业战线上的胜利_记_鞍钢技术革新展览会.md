Victory on the Industrial Front
——A Record of the “Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition”
By our reporter Lin Li

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Technical Innovation Exhibition, sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, has opened at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace.

More than three years ago, the Chinese People's Liberation Army War Achievements Exhibition was held next to the Working People's Cultural Palace. The exhibits at that exhibition demonstrated the glorious victory of the Chinese people on the military front. The exhibits at this Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition specifically illustrate the great achievements of our people on the industrial front. However, the war achievements exhibition was held after the end of the war on the mainland, while this technical innovation exhibition is only the prelude to the national technical innovation movement.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition includes two aspects. One aspect belongs to basic construction. This is the newly built, fully mechanized and automated enterprise under the selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the direct help of Soviet experts. Among them are the construction process and completed models of the largest large-scale rolling mill in the country, my country's first seamless steel pipe factory, and the No. 7 blast furnace; the other aspect is the old factories left over from the Japanese puppet period, which have been painstakingly reformed by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, and the degree of mechanization and automation has been greatly improved. The so-called "technical innovation" is mainly the transformation of old factories.

From the huge scale of the new construction projects, we can clearly see the speed of the country's industrialization and the bright and brilliant prospects; the factories that have undergone technical innovation all concentratedly reflect the high wisdom and creative talents of the Chinese working class.

Now, let’s take a look at the exhibits in the technical innovation section first.

The exhibits in the technical innovation section, like the actual movement of Anshan Iron and Steel, started with the successful creation of the anti-encircling disk by Zhang Mingshan, a worker at a small rolling mill, and then gradually spread to various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. These exhibits show that through the technical innovation movement, various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel have greatly improved labor productivity, reduced production costs, improved product quality, improved labor conditions, ensured safe production, and strengthened planned management, thereby pushing the labor competition to a new stage. This is to transform the past sprint-style physical strength competition into a continuous and regular labor method of reforming production technology and changing labor organization. Therefore, the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel actually provides the direction of development for labor competition in various factories and mines across the country, and also points out a new path for the transformation of my country's old industrial and mining enterprises.

In front of the exhibits of the small rolling mill, several huge charts summarized the characteristics of the old enterprises of Anshan Iron and Steel. The old Anshan Iron and Steel, like many of my country's original factories and mines, was a semi-manual operation factory. Its equipment was simple and the workers' labor conditions were extremely bad. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel described their past miserable lives as:

"The ore dressing is like a big pigpen,
The small-scale competition is like the Yama Temple,
If workers want to make a living,
It is difficult to pass the gate of hell in steelmaking."

The situation of the old small rolling mill was indeed quite bad. This can also be proved by the charts. At that time, people operated next to the steel billets with a high heat of more than 1,200 degrees. People used their hands to hold heavy iron tongs and pull the steel billets, which averaged more than 140 kilograms, in and out. People were sweating profusely and panting. After not many years, the strong fire light smoked people's eyes into "night blindness". If the action was slightly slow, the red-hot steel bar would jump up several feet high like a grumpy poisonous snake. Sometimes it would pierce the worker's chest, and sometimes it would wrap around the worker's neck several times. But when the steel billet was rolled into a steel bar, the cooling water poured down like a torrential rain. The steel bar cooled down quickly, and the people's clothes were also soaked. The human body could not withstand this sudden cold and heat torture, and soon people were exhausted with leg pain, back pain, cramps, etc.

The exhibits at the exhibition also show that the country has made many efforts to improve workers' labor conditions in recent years, and major personal accidents and burns have indeed decreased. In terms of production, the employees of the small rolling mill have also done their due diligence. After one political reform movement and labor competition movement after another, production has exceeded the highest level during the puppet Manchurian period. However, the past labor competition that relied solely on physical strength could not create more wealth for the country.

"Security uniforms" and "health meals" and other labor protection measures could not fundamentally change the workers' labor environment. In 1952, the state assigned a arduous task to the small rolling mill. However, at that time, the management system of the old enterprise had not been completely transformed. After the "Three-Anti" movement, a group of cadres were transferred away, and the leadership relaxed its leadership over production. For a time, no one was responsible for production, the operation was abnormally chaotic, and waste products were increasing day by day. The production tasks in April and May were not completed. At the same time as this series of problems occurred, a major accident occurred in which a rolling mill crushed to death the Communist Party member An Huimin.

The situation at that time was serious. But the employees of the small rolling mill were strong. They knew that this was a natural reflection of the further development of production, and a total exposure of the old enterprise's inability to adapt to the new situation. So they buried the deceased, wiped away their tears, and unanimously announced that they would change the backward situation of the small rolling mill. The responsible cadres of the small rolling mill also personally went to the workshop to find the key problems in production with the workers. They summarized the phenomena at that time into three points, believing that the main problems were: "Many waste products, damaged equipment, and unreasonable operation." Among them, "damaged equipment" was the most prominent. Then they put forward three goals, deciding to: "Standardize products, rationalize operations, and automate machinery." At the same time, they determined that "mechanical automation" was the "center of the center" and the "key of the key". In this way, the newly appointed factory director personally took a stopwatch to the workshop. He squatted next to the rough rolling mill, which had the most problems at the time, and from measuring the rolling process of each steel billet, he found a way to improve the efficiency of the rough rolling mill. He told his observation to Jiang Xingjia, the apprentice of the deceased worker An Huimin, and asked Jiang Xingjia to lead his team to experiment. Jiang Xingjia was a member of the Youth League and also An Huimin's best apprentice. With infinite mourning for his master, he began the "fast rolling" experiment. In a few days, he reduced the original rough rolling process, which took seventeen seconds, to eleven and a half seconds. This increased the output and solved the difficulty of the rough rolling mill not being able to supply the smooth rolling mill. But it also brought new imbalances. At this time, its previous process - the heating furnace - could not supply steel billets; its next process - the smooth rolling mill - could not complete the rough billets it sent. The situation was particularly serious with the smooth rolling mill, which was a typical semi-manual operation, which was slow and prone to waste products. Major personal accidents often occurred here. The employees of the small rolling mill knew that production could not advance without changing the appearance of the smooth rolling mill. However, it was not easy to change the equipment that had been in place for many years.

In the exhibition room of the small rolling mill, there is a color portrait of Zhang Mingshan, who is famous throughout the country. This man is in his forties, tall and strong. He is wearing work clothes and holding a tool tightly in his hand. He has spent more than 20 years of his life as a worker. He has the deepest feelings about the pain of rolling mill workers. He once said: "Whenever it rains, I see people with leg pain, back pain, cramps, and shouting. My heart softens. While I stretch their legs and massage their muscles, I think about ways to change the production equipment." Zhang Mingshan had long planned to manufacture an anti-encircling disk to replace the work of the clamp workers, but it was not possible before liberation. In the early days of liberation, he felt that "Anshan Iron and Steel has been liberated, and workers should also be liberated from machines." So, he began research on the anti-encircling disk. He had repeatedly told his anti-encircling disk plan to engineering technicians and administrative leaders, but he was blocked by people with conservative ideas several times. However, Zhang Mingshan did not give up, and he continued to study and improve it in secret. Until the summer of 1952, when the factory called for "mechanical automation," especially the success of the "fast rolling method," gave Zhang Mingshan great encouragement. He felt it was time to take out the anti-encircling disk. Sure enough, this time his plan received enthusiastic support from the factory director and Soviet experts. The suggestion to make an anti-encircling disk was included in the factory's technical measures plan. On September 16, the day of the formal experiment of the anti-encircling disk, the rolling mill workshop was crowded with people, nervously watching Zhang Mingshan's anti-encircling disk. The moment the steel billet smoothly passed through the anti-encircling disk, people applauded thunderously. An old worker named Lv Changkuan hugged Zhang Mingshan and said: "This time, we can live ten years longer!"

Yes, Zhang Mingshan's anti-encircling disk immediately replaced the physical labor of the clamp workers, allowing people to get rid of the working environment of fire roasting and water freezing. The efficiency of the smooth rolling mill increased by 25%, creating huge wealth for the country. However, more importantly, it established a model for technical innovation and led the labor competition of relying solely on physical strength to the path of technical innovation.

The appearance of the anti-encircling disk raised new questions for the entire rolling mill workshop. It required its upstream and downstream processes to quickly improve efficiency, otherwise it could not carry out production evenly, nor could it increase the output of the entire rolling mill. At this time, a feeding machine appeared in the feeding process, an automatic steel pusher appeared on the heating furnace, a steel turning machine appeared in the southern part of the rough rolling mill, an automatic rotating rod appeared on the cooling table, and the rough rolling vertical encircling disk was improved four times on the second working section. That is to say, the wave of technical innovation swept to every process, and there were creations and improvements, large and small, on every process. Adding these improvements and creations together changed the entire appearance of the small rolling mill. Now, the exhibits displayed in the exhibition can no longer see the terrible and dangerous scene of artificial clamping. The entire production process of the small rolling mill, from the heating furnace to the shearing and finishing, relies entirely on mechanical "labor."

Zhang Mingshan's great initiative changed the appearance of the small rolling mill and also set off a wave of technical innovation in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. In this regard, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has done a lot of work. Not long after Zhang Mingshan's anti-encircling disk appeared, the Anshan Municipal Committee promptly convened an award ceremony and specifically summarized the experience of the small rolling mill in carrying out the technical innovation movement. The Municipal Committee called on Anshan employees to learn from Zhang Mingshan and from the small rolling mill. At the same time, it organized employees from various factories and mines to visit the small rolling mill. Under the leadership and promotion of the Anshan Municipal Committee, the technical innovation movement caused a sensation in various factories and mines. The Anshan Steel Wire Rope Factory is one of the best in promoting the experience of technical innovation.

The exhibits of the steel wire rope factory are next to the small rolling mill. The exhibits show that before the steel wire rope factory promoted the experience of the small rolling mill, its machinery and equipment and labor conditions were the same as those of the small rolling mill, and production was carried out under backward semi-manual operation conditions. Therefore, when the Anshan Municipal Committee called on people to learn from the small rolling mill, they took the lead in responding. The steel wire rope factory selected advanced elements in production, experienced veteran workers, and labor models to visit the small rolling mill. Through the visit, the workers further realized the importance of technical innovation. The workers said: "Zhang Mingshan's one reform can create 22 billion yuan of wealth for the country in one year, and also liberate the workers from heavy physical labor. It is impossible to do this by relying solely on physical competition." The steel wire rope factory also used the experience of the small rolling mill as teaching materials for spare-time schools, explaining and discussing it every day. At the same time, the leading cadres of the steel wire rope factory reviewed their attitude of not paying attention to rationalization proposals in front of the employees, and reorganized and improved the rationalization proposal organization. At this time, various leading cadres also personally went to the workshop to find the key problems in production with the workers. When they collected the problems together, they found that there were sixteen places that needed to be reformed. So the administration marked out topics, and the trade union mobilized employees to grab topics. In this way, the technical innovation movement of the steel wire rope factory unfolded. Li Genyuan, who has been a fitter for more than 20 years, created and improved seven tools and equipment by himself. These are the "automatic wire winding machine," "automatic meter cutting machine," "automatic mold making machine," "drilling wood wheel eye" and "small crane" displayed in the exhibition room.

During this period, the steel wire rope factory had a total of nineteen creations and improvements. Each one created or saved huge amounts of wealth for the country and also changed the workers' labor conditions. Let's talk about the "automatic mold making machine" displayed here. Among the many inventions and creations, this is a relatively simple creation. But in the past, mold workers had to hold a large eight-pound iron hammer, and it took 20 minutes to hammer each mold, relying on manual hammering 130 times. Now it is changed to hammering with electric power. As long as the power button is turned on, the mold making machine will automatically hammer, and it can be completed in eight minutes. This is not only that the machine replaces heavy physical labor, but also increases the yield by three times. But more importantly, the steel wire rope factory created the experience of promoting the experience of technical innovation, which pushed the technical innovation movement of the small rolling mill to a higher and farther level.

The inventions and creations seen in the small rolling mill are mostly individual activities of workers, or joint research by individual workers and individual technical personnel. The most prominent thing in the steel wire rope factory is collective activity. When the steel wire rope factory improved and created these tools and equipment, not only 80% of the technical workers participated in the movement, but also individual activities gradually moved towards organized collective research. The earliest appearance here was the "Zou Delian Three-Person Technical Research Group". The oil fumes in Zou Delian's workplace were very choking, and many people became seriously ill because of this. Zou Delian wanted to change this environment, but he couldn't think of a way for a long time. Later, he found the trade union group leader and an old worker and organized a trick group. The three people studied together and, as a result, the oil fumes were extracted from above the skylight. This incident immediately attracted the attention of the leading cadres. They summarized Zou Delian's experience, pointed out the benefits of collective research, and called on people to learn Zou Delian's methods and give full play to the spirit of collectivism. So forty-three technical research groups immediately appeared. Once people were organized, they discovered more equipment that needed to be improved, but in these improvements, they increasingly felt that groups of three or five people could not adapt to the development of the movement. At this time, the organization of "Joint Technical Research Groups" appeared. Among these, there was a combination of workers and technicians, a combination of this process and that process, and more often a combination of production workers and repair workers. This combination brought together scattered wisdom into a great creative force, shortening the process of individual exploration. Of the sixteen major improvements and creations after April 1953, eleven were collectively researched by "Technical Research Groups" or "Joint Technical Research Groups."

The steel wire rope factory added new blood to the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel, which enabled the entire movement to develop rapidly and healthily. Behind the exhibits of the steel wire rope factory are the exhibits of the ore dressing plant, the chemical plant, the iron smelting plant, the steelmaking plant, the rough rolling mill, the power plant, the metal products factory, the refractory material factory, etc. These exhibits show that the technical innovation movement has developed from factories to mines, from major production factories and mines to affiliated units, and from technically simple civil construction departments to technically sophisticated power plants and substations. Liu Zuwei, the assistant engineer of the power plant, who had already made many creations, put forward the goal of "taking the road of Zhang Mingshan" at this time. In these exhibition rooms, there are tens of thousands of rationalization proposals put forward by workers and technicians with the help of Soviet experts, and hundreds of advanced experiences and advanced operating methods that they have jointly created. Among these exhibits with significant economic value, there is also something that seems unimportant, but it specifically and profoundly illustrates the scale and depth of the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel. This is the rice washing machine created by the employees of the welfare office. Previously, their cooks washed rice with bamboo sieves used by old ladies in the countryside, completely using their hands to shake them. Because of the rapid expansion of the Anshan Iron and Steel workforce, the number of people eating was increasing day by day, and the manual cooking method could not meet people's needs. They made a rice washing machine that could wash 2,000 catties of rice at a time. The cooks were freed from part of their physical labor and solved the problem of people's meals.

The technical innovation movement has become the main form of labor competition for the broad masses of employees. It has attracted all the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel. Wang Chonglun of the General Machinery Factory created the "Universal Tool Tire," and the movement reached a new climax. The technical innovation section of the exhibition ends with the exhibits of the General Machinery Factory.

In the exhibition room of the General Machinery Factory, there is the process of Wang Chonglun's eight improvements to production tools, the production comparison before and after the improvement of tools, and the pictures of the General Party Branch promoting Wang Chonglun's advanced experience. What is particularly noteworthy here is a chart showing Wang Chonglun's soaring production. This chart compares his production volume in the first three months of 1953 to 100. In April, it soared to a peak of 190, which was the result of his successful creation of the "Universal Tool Tire". However, Wang Chonglun did not relax, and he continued to work hard. In May, he reached 402, in June he soared to 649, in July he rose to 903, and in August, September, and October, he continued to go up and up. By December, he had reached 1,781. What does this 1,781 percent mean? This means that in 1953, he completed the workload of four years, one month, and seventeen days.

Wang Chonglun's glorious deeds represent a new climax in the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel. Wang Chonglun's name has spread all over the country. The exhibition room displays the situation of learning from Wang Chonglun's innovative spirit throughout the country. Here, there are pictures and newsletters of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory learning technical innovation from Anshan Iron and Steel, and pictures of the Daye Steel Plant imitating the anti-encircling disk. In addition, there are the achievements of the Kunming Wire and Cable Factory in promoting the experience of technical innovation in Anshan Iron and Steel, as well as exhibitions of achievements after learning in Chongqing, Taiyuan, Nanjing... and many other factories and mines.

The exhibition is to report the achievements of the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel to the people of our country, but its more important task is to promote the labor competition of various factories and mines throughout the country, and to learn the experience of the technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel throughout the country. Therefore, after these exhibits are exhibited in Beijing, they will also be exhibited in Shanghai, Hankou and other places. It can be predicted that with the exhibition's exhibition, a larger and wider technical innovation movement will be launched throughout the country. Let us wish the victory of the technical innovation movement and the early realization of the country's industrialization!

    工业战线上的胜利
    ——记“鞍钢技术革新展览会”
    本报记者　林里
    中华全国总工会主办的，鞍山钢铁公司技术革新展览会，在北京劳动人民文化宫开幕了。
    三年多以前，劳动人民文化宫旁边，曾经举办过中国人民解放军战绩展览会。那次展览会的展品，显示了中国人民在军事战线上的辉煌胜利。这次鞍钢技术革新展览会的展品，具体说明了我国人民在工业战线上的伟大成绩。不过，那次战绩展览会，是在结束了大陆上的战争以后举行的，这次的技术革新展览会，仅仅是全国技术革新运动的序幕。
    鞍钢技术革新展览会包括两个方面，一方面是属于基本建设的。这就是在苏联政府无私的援助下，和苏联专家直接帮助下新近建成的，全部机械化、自动化的企业，这里面，有全国最大的大型轧钢厂、有我国第一座无缝钢管厂和七号炼铁炉的建设过程，以及建成后的模型；另一方面，是日伪时期遗留下来的半手工操作的旧工厂，经过鞍钢职工的辛勤改革，机械化和自动化的程度已经大大提高了。所谓“技术革新”，主要是对旧工厂的改造。
    从新建工程的巨大规模上，我们清楚地看见了国家工业化的前进速度和光辉灿烂的远景；经过技术革新的工厂，都集中地反映了中国工人阶级的高度智慧和创造才能。
    现在，我们先来看看技术革新部分的展览。
    技术革新部分的展览，也像鞍钢的实际运动一样，是从小型轧钢厂工人张明山创造反围盘成功开始，然后又一步步地推向鞍钢各厂矿。这些展品表明：经过技术革新运动，鞍钢各厂矿都大大地提高了劳动生产率，降低了生产成本，提高了产品质量，改善了劳动条件，保证了安全生产，加强了计划管理，从而把劳动竞赛推向了一个新的阶段。这就是把过去那种带有突击性的拼体力的竞赛，变成了改革生产技术和改变劳动组织的持续而经常的劳动方式了。因此，鞍钢的技术革新运动，实际上提供了全国各厂矿的劳动竞赛的发展方向，也替我国旧有工矿企业的改造指出了新的道路。
    小型轧钢厂展览品的前面，几幅巨大挂图，概括了鞍钢旧有企业的特点。旧日的鞍钢，也跟我国原有的许多厂矿一样，是一个半手工操作的工厂。它的设备简陋，工人的劳动条件极坏。鞍钢的工人们形容过去的悲惨生活说：
    “选矿好像大猪圈，
    小型赛似阎王殿，
    工人要吃这碗饭，
    难过炼钢鬼门关。”
    旧日的小型轧钢厂的情况，确实是相当恶劣的。这也可以由挂图上得到证明。那时候，人们在一千二百多度高热的钢胚旁边进行操作，人们是用两只手，握着笨重的铁钳，把平均一百四十多公斤重的钢胚拉进又拉出。人们累得汗流浃背，气喘吁吁，不要多少年月，强烈的火光就把人们的眼睛薰成了“雀蒙眼”。要是动作稍一迟缓，通红的钢条就像暴躁的毒蛇，一下跳起几尺高，有时它会穿过工人的胸膛，有时却在工人的脖子上一缠好几遭。但当钢胚轧成钢条以后，冷却水又像瓢泼的大雨，一下浇了过来。钢条迅速冷却了，人们的衣服也被浇湿了。人体经受不了这种骤冷骤热的熬煎，不多时就累得腿疼、腰疼、抽筋等。
    展览会的展品同时表明：这几年来，国家在改善工人的劳动条件方面做了许多努力，重大的人身事故和烫伤事故确实减少了。在生产方面，小型轧钢厂的职工们也尽了他们应尽的力量。他们经过一个又一个的政治改革运动和劳动竞赛运动，生产量都超过了伪满时期的最高水平。但是过去那种单拼体力的劳动竞赛，不能给国家创造更多的财富。
  “保安服”与“保健饭”一类的劳动保护，也不可能从根本上改变工人的劳动环境。一九五二年，国家交给小型轧钢厂的任务是艰巨的。可是那时旧企业的管理制度还没有完全改造过来，“三反”运动过后又调走了一批干部，领导上放松了对生产的领导，一时生产无人负责，操作异常混乱，废品日益增多，四、五月份的生产任务都没有完成，在这一连串问题发生的同时，又发生了轧钢机压死共产党员安惠民的重大事故。
    当时的情况是严重的。但是小型轧钢厂的职工们是坚强的，他们知道，这是生产进一步发展的自然反映，是旧企业不能适应新形势的总暴露。于是他们安葬了死者，擦干了眼泪，一致宣布要把小型轧钢厂的落后局面改变过来。小型轧钢厂的负责干部，也亲自下到车间，跟工人一起寻找生产中的关键问题。他们把当时的现象概括了三点，认为主要是：“废品多，设备坏，操作不合理。”其中尤以“设备坏”最为突出。接着就提出三个奋斗目标，决定要：“产品标准化，操作合理化，机械自动化。”同时确定“机械自动化”是“中心的中心”，“重点的重点”。就这样：新上任的厂长亲自拿着秒表到了车间，他蹲在当时问题最多的毛轧机旁边，从测定每一根钢胚的轧出过程中，找到了提高毛轧效率的门路。他把他的观察说给已故工人安惠民的徒弟——姜兴家，要姜兴家带领他的小组试验。姜兴家是青年团员，也是安惠民最好的徒弟，他怀着对师傅的无限悼念的心情，开始了“快速轧钢”的试验。不几天，就把原来费时十七秒的毛轧过程，缩减成为十一秒五了。这就提高了产量，解决了毛轧供不上光轧的困难。但它同时带来了新的不平衡。这时候，它的前一道工序——加热炉，供不上钢胚；它的下一道工序——光轧机又做不完它送来的毛胚。情况特别严重的是光轧机，它是半手工操作的典型，既慢，又容易出废品，重大的人身事故往往发生在这里。小型轧钢厂的职工们知道：不改变光轧机的面貌，生产就不能前进。但是，要把多年来的设备改观，这实在不是容易的事。
    小型轧钢厂的展览室里，有一幅彩色画像，这就是闻名全国的张明山。这人有四十多岁，身材魁梧健壮，他穿着工装，手里还紧握着一个什么工具。他已经度过了二十多年的工人生活。对轧钢工人的痛苦，感受最深。他曾说过：“一到阴天下雨，我看见人们这个腿疼，那个腰疼，这个抽筋，那个叫唤，我的心就软了。我一边给他们伸腿揉筋，一边琢磨着改变生产设备的道路。”张明山早就打算制造一个反围盘，来代替夹钳工人的工作，但在解放前没有可能。解放初期，他觉得“鞍钢解放了，工人也应该从机器上解放出来啦”。于是，他开始了反围盘的研究。他曾经三番五次的把他的反围盘计划说给工程技术人员和行政领导者，但几次都被保守主义思想的人们挡住了。然而张明山并没有泄气，他还在暗地里研究改进。直到一九五二年夏天，厂里号召“机械自动化”的时候，特别是“快速轧钢法”的成功，给张明山以很大鼓励。他觉得是拿出反围盘的时机了。果然，这一次他的计划得到了厂长和苏联专家热情的支持。制作反围盘的建议，被订在厂里的技术措施计划里了。九月十六日正式试验反围盘那天，轧钢车间人山人海，紧张地看着张明山的反围盘。当钢胚顺利通过反围盘的一刹那间，人们掌声如雷。有一位叫吕长宽的老工人，他拦腰搂住张明山说：“这一下，我们可以多活十年了！”
    是的，张明山的反围盘一下就代替了夹钳工人的体力劳动，使人们摆脱了火烤、水冰的工作环境。光轧机的效率提高了百分之二十五，为国家创造了巨额财富。然而，更重要的是树立了技术革新的榜样，把单拼体力的劳动竞赛，引向了技术革新的道路。
    反围盘的出现，给整个轧钢车间提出了新的问题。它要求它的上下工序迅速提高效率，否则就不能均衡地进行生产，也不能提高整个轧钢厂的产量。这时候，送料方面出现了运料机，加热炉上出现了自动推钢机，毛轧南部出现了翻钢机，冷却台上出现了自动回转棒，二工段上四次改进了毛轧立围盘。这就是说，技术革新的浪潮涌到了每一个工序，每一个工序上也都出现了大大小小的创造和改进。把这些改进和创造加在一起，就改变了小型轧钢厂的整个面貌。现在，陈列在展览会的展品，再也看不见那种可怕的、人工夹钳的危险场面了，小型轧钢厂从加热炉到剪断和精整的整个生产过程，全部依靠机械“劳动”了。
    张明山的伟大创举改变了小型轧钢厂的面貌，也掀起了鞍钢各厂矿的技术革新的浪潮。在这方面，中共鞍山市委会做了不少工作。张明山的反围盘出现不久，鞍山市委就及时地召开了发奖大会，并专门总结了小型轧钢厂开展技术革新运动的经验。市委号召鞍山职工向张明山学习，向小型轧钢厂学习。同时，组织各厂矿职工去小型轧钢厂参观。在鞍山市委的领导、推动下，技术革新运动轰动了各厂矿。鞍山钢绳厂，就是推广技术革新经验中最好的一个。
    钢绳厂的展品，紧接在小型轧钢厂的后面。展品表明：钢绳厂在推广小型轧钢厂的经验以前，机器设备和劳动条件也和小型轧钢厂一样，是在落后的半手工操作的状况下进行生产。因此，当鞍山市委号召向小型轧钢厂学习的时候，他们便首起响应。钢绳厂挑选了生产上的先进分子，有经验的老工人和劳动模范到小型轧钢厂参观。通过参观，工人们进一步认识了技术革新的重要。工人们说：“张明山一项改革，一年就能给国家创造二百二十亿元的财富，而且还把工人们从笨重的体力劳动中解放了出来。要是单凭体力竞赛，那是永也办不到的。”钢绳厂还把小型轧钢厂的经验当做业余学校的教材，每天讲解、讨论。同时，钢绳厂的领导干部，在职工面前检讨了不重视合理化建议的态度，重新整顿和健全了合理化建议组织。这时，各个领导干部也亲自下到车间，跟工人一起寻找生产中的关键问题。当他们把问题搜集在一起，发现有十六个需要改革的地方。于是行政上标出课题，工会发动职工抢课题。就这样，钢绳厂的技术革新运动展开了。做了二十多年钳工的栗根源，一个人就创造和改进了七件工具设备。这就是陈列在展览室里的“自动卷线机”，“自动米数切断机”，“自动打模机”，“钻木轮眼子”和“小吊车”等。
    在这期间，钢绳厂一共有十九件创造和改进。每一件都给国家创造或节省了巨额财富，也改变了工人的劳动条件。就说陈列在这里的“自动打模机”吧，在许多发明创造当中，这是一个比较简单的创造。但过去打模工人要举着八磅重的大铁锤，每打一个模要费二十分钟的时间，靠人工锤打一百三十下。现在改为用电力锤打，只要一开电钮，打模机就自动锤打，八分钟就可以完工。这就不光是机器代替了笨重的体力劳动，而且提高成品率三倍。但是更重要的是：钢绳厂创造了推广技术革新经验的经验，它把小型轧钢厂的技术革新运动推向了更高和更远的境地。
    在小型轧钢厂里看见的发明创造，多是工人的单独活动，再就是个别工人和个别技术人员的共同研究。而钢绳厂里最突出的是集体活动。钢绳厂在改进和创造这些工具设备的时候，不仅百分之八十的技术工人参加了运动，而且由各个人的单独活动，逐渐走上了有组织的集体研究。这里最早出现的是“邹德连三人技术研究小组”。邹德连工作的地方油烟十分呛人，不少人因此身染重病。邹德连想改变这种环境，自己想了好久没办法。以后他找到工会小组长和一名老工人，组织了窍门小组。三人一起研究，结果就把油烟从天窗上面抽出去了。这件事，立刻引起了领导干部的重视，他们总结了邹德连的经验，指出集体研究的好处，号召人们学习邹德连的方法，发挥集体主义的精神。于是立刻出现了四十三个技术研究小组。人们一经组织起来，就发现了更多需要改进的设备，但在这些改进中，也越来越感到三、五个人的小组，不能适应于运动的发展，这时就出现了“联合技术研究小组”的组织。这中间，有工人和技术人员的联合，有这一道工序和那一道工序的联合，更多的是生产工人和修理工人的联合。这种联合，把分散的智慧组成了一支伟大的创造力量，缩短了个人摸索的过程。一九五三年四月以后的十六件重大改进和创造，就有十一件是“技术研究小组”或“联合技术研究小组”集体研究成功的。
    钢绳厂给鞍钢的技术革新运动增加了新血液，这就使整个运动得以迅速而健康的发展。钢绳厂展览品后面，是选矿厂、化工总厂、炼铁厂、炼钢厂、初轧厂、发电厂、金属制品厂、耐火材料厂、……的展品。这些展品表明：技术革新运动已经由工厂发展到矿山，由主要生产厂矿发展到附设单位，由技术粗简的土木建筑部门发展到技术精湛的发电厂、变电站。已经有过不少创造的、发电厂的助理工程师刘祖威，这时候又提出了“走张明山的道路”的奋斗目标。在这些展览室里，有工人和技术人员，在苏联专家帮助下所提出的成千上万件的合理化建议，有他们共同创造的数以百计的先进经验和先进操作法。在这些具有重大经济价值的展品中，还有一件看来不大重要的东西，但它却具体而深刻地说明了鞍钢技术革新运动的规模与深度。这就是福利处的职工们创造的淘米机。以前，他们的炊事员淘米，是用乡下老太太用的竹筛子，完全用两只手摇晃。因为鞍钢职工队伍的迅速扩大，吃饭的人一天天增多，手工式的做饭方式不能满足人们的需要，他们就制造了一部淘米机，一次可以淘两千斤大米。炊事员摆脱了一部分体力劳动，又解决了人们的吃饭问题。
    技术革新运动成了广大职工劳动竞赛的主要形式，它吸引了鞍钢的所有职工，到机械总厂王崇伦创造“万能工具胎”，运动达到了新的高潮。展览会的技术革新部分，就是用机械总厂的展品作为结尾的。
    机械总厂的展览室里，有王崇伦八次改进生产工具的过程，有改进工具前后的生产对比，有党总支推广王崇伦先进经验的图画。在这里，特别引人注意的，是一张表明王崇伦生产飞跃上升的图表。这张图表把他一九五三年头三个月的生产量比做一百。到了四月，一下就猛升到了一百九十的高峰，这是他创造“万能工具胎”成功的结果。但是，王崇伦并没有松劲，他在继续努力。五月份他达到了四百零二，六月份又猛升到六百四十九，七月份升到九百零三，八月，九月，十月，他一直向上，一直向上。到十二月，他已达到一千七百八十一了。这百分之一千七百八十一意味着什么呢？这就是说，他在一九五三年内，完成了四年一月又十七天的工作量了。
    王崇伦的光荣事迹，代表着鞍钢技术革新运动的新高潮。王崇伦的名字已经传遍了全国各地。展览室里，陈列着全国各地学习王崇伦革新精神的情况。这里，有北京石景山钢铁厂，学习鞍钢技术革新的图画和简报，有大冶钢厂仿制反围盘的画面，此外，还有昆明电线厂推广鞍钢技术革新经验的成绩，有重庆，有太原，有南京……许许多多厂矿学习后的成绩展览。
    展览会是向我国人民报道鞍钢技术革新运动的成就，但它更重要的任务，是要把全国各个厂矿的劳动竞赛推向前进，是要全国各地学习鞍钢技术革新运动的经验。因此，这些展览品在北京展览过后，还要向上海、汉口等地去展览。可以预计，随着展览会的出展，全国各地将会掀起一个规模更大、范围更广的轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，让我们预祝技术革新运动的胜利，预祝祖国工业化的早日实现！
