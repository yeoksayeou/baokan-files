    Enterprises Under the Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Pre-fulfilled the Production Plan of Major Products in the First Quarter
   [This News] Enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry pre-fulfilled the first quarter's plan for five major products. By March 29, the completion of the plan for the five major products was as follows: iron ore ahead of schedule by six days, metallurgical coke ahead of schedule by two days, pig iron ahead of schedule by five days, steel ahead of schedule by four days, and steel materials ahead of schedule by nine days. The output of major products in the first quarter of this year increased significantly compared with the same period last year, with the highest exceeding 43.9 percent. In the first quarter of last year, three major products failed to meet the plan, while this year, all major product plans were pre-fulfilled.
    Since the start of production this year, the Steel Industry Administration has attached particular importance to the work of promoting advanced experience. In terms of iron smelting, it promoted the Soviet Union's advanced furnace top regulation experience, and at the same time implemented a raw material management system, creating conditions for increasing production; in terms of steel smelting, it promoted the Soviet advanced medium cold repair method, implemented parallel bricklaying operations, and improved the preparation and organization of cold repairs, which greatly shortened the cold repair time. At the same time, it implemented a regular hot repair system and furnace protection regulations, which significantly reduced the hot repair rate and improved the quality of hot repairs; in terms of steel rolling, it continued to promote the experience of the mechanized movement of the Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill, which improved labor productivity and improved the working conditions of workers. At the same time, it implemented a regular maintenance system, which greatly reduced temporary shutdowns. The promotion of these advanced experiences has guaranteed the over-fulfillment of the first quarter's major product plan.

    第一季度主要产品的生产计划提前完成
   【本报讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业，提前完成了第一季度五种主要产品计划。到三月二十九日，五种主要产品完成计划情况为：铁矿石提前六天，冶金焦提前两天，生铁提前五天，钢提前四天，钢材提前九天完成了计划。今年第一季度主要产品产量比去年同期有很大的增长，最多的超过百分之四十三点九。去年第一季度有三种主要产品未完成计划，今年全部主要产品计划提前完成了。
    今年开始生产以来，钢铁工业管理局特别重视推广先进经验的工作。在炼铁方面推广了苏联的先进炉顶调剂经验，同时推行了原料管理制度，为提高产量创造了条件；在炼钢方面，推广了苏联先进中冷修方法，推行平行砌砖作业，并改进了冷修的准备和组织工作，使冷修时间大大缩短，同时推行了定期热修制度和护炉规程，使热修率显著降低，并提高了热修质量；在轧钢方面，继续推广了鞍钢小型轧钢厂机械化运动的经验，提高了劳动生产率，改善了工人的劳动条件，同时贯彻了定期检修制度，使临时停工现象大为减少。这些先进经验的推广，对超额完成第一季度主要产品计划起了保证作用。
