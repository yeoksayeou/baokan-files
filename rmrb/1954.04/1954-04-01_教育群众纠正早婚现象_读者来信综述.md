    Education of the Masses to Correct Early Marriage
    ——A Summary of Readers' Letters
    Many readers' letters reflect that the phenomenon of early marriage is still very serious in some areas. Reader Sun Xiaocheng wrote that in Baisheng Town, Second District, Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, those who marry early account for more than 40% of all marriages, and the number is still increasing; farmer Chi Zhenshou's son, Chi Xinshui, got married before he was even fifteen years old. Reader Wang Qun wrote that in Dongguan Township, Chengxiang District, Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, three people got married this January before reaching the legal marriage age. Reader Tong Bin wrote that students Sun Yongyan and Yu Desheng from Guo Jia Elementary School in the Fifth District of Andong County, Liaodong Province, got married under the instruction of their parents and with the permission of village cadres, despite not being old enough to marry. In addition, readers from Jianli County in Hubei, Xunyi County in Shaanxi, Anguo County in Hebei, and the eastern suburbs of Beijing also reported similar situations.
    Readers pointed out that the main reason for the phenomenon of early marriage is that the Party and government leading organs in these areas have not regularly carried out publicity and education on the Marriage Law among the masses; or when publicizing the Marriage Law, they only paid attention to promoting the point of freedom of marriage for men and women, and did not explain the principle that one must reach a certain age to get married. This has led the vast majority of the masses, and even many village cadres, to not understand the disadvantages of early marriage. The phenomenon of early marriage continues to appear among the masses, and village cadres do not educate or stop this situation, and some even falsely report the age for those who marry early. For example, Huo Xiaohong, a fifteen-year-old girl from the First District of Anguo County, Hebei Province, went to the district with the man to apply for marriage registration, saying that she was already eighteen years old. The district cadre didn't believe it. The village women's committee member, Huo Yinru, wrote a "guarantee" for her, guaranteeing that she was "indeed eighteen years old."
    Secondly, the lack of seriousness and rigor in marriage registration work in some areas has also made it impossible to discover and stop early marriages in a timely manner. For example, the comrades in charge of marriage registration at the Wangqiao District People's Government in Jianli County, Hubei Province, allowed many people who had not reached the marriage age to register and get married.
    Early marriage not only affects the health of both men and women, but it is also harmful to the health of children and the entire nation. Therefore, readers suggest that the Party and government leading organs at all levels regularly and comprehensively carry out publicity of the Marriage Law to the masses, prohibit forced arranged marriages, and make the masses aware of the harm of early marriage, and consciously correct this bad habit. In addition, staff responsible for handling marriage registration should strengthen their sense of responsibility in their work, care about the happiness of men and women after marriage, and earnestly grasp the provisions of the Marriage Law that "men must be twenty years old and women must be eighteen years old to marry"; those who are not old enough to marry should be stopped, and they should be patiently told about the harm of early marriage, and advised to wait until they are old enough to marry.

### 教育群众纠正早婚现象——读者来信综述

    教育群众纠正早婚现象
    ——读者来信综述
    许多读者来信反映，目前某些地区早婚现象还很严重。读者孙孝程来信说：福建省连江县二区百胜镇，早婚者占全部结婚人数的百分之四十以上，目前还在不断增多；农民池振寿的儿子池信水还不到十五岁就结了婚。读者王群来信说：江西省广丰县城厢区东关乡在今年一月就有三个人没有到结婚年龄就结了婚。读者童斌来信说：辽东省安东县五区郭家小学学生孙永岩、玉德升等都没有达到结婚年龄，在家长主使和村干部的允许下结了婚。此外，湖北监利县、陕西栒邑县、河北安国县和北京市东郊区等地的读者也反映了类似的情况。
    读者指出，产生早婚现象的主要原因，是这些地区的党政领导机关没有经常向群众进行婚姻法的宣传教育；或者在宣传婚姻法时只注意宣传男女婚姻自主这一点，而没有说明要达到一定年龄才能结婚的道理。这就使广大群众甚至不少乡村干部不了解早婚的坏处。群众中早婚现象不断出现，而乡村干部对这种情况也不去教育制止，甚至有的还替早婚者虚报年龄。如河北安国县一区十五岁的女孩霍小红，和男方一起到区里要求登记结婚时，说自己已经有十八岁。区干部不相信。村妇女委员霍银儒就替她写了个“保证书”，保证她“确实十八岁”。
    其次，有些地区在进行婚姻登记工作时不够严肃、认真，也使早婚现象不能及时被发现和制止。如湖北监利县汪桥区人民政府负责婚姻登记工作的同志，竟让许多未到结婚年龄的人登记结了婚。
    早婚不但会影响男女双方的健康，而且对于子女和整个民族的健康都是有害的。因此，读者建议各地党、政领导机关经常地、全面地向群众进行婚姻法的宣传，禁止强迫包办婚姻，并使群众认识早婚的危害性，自觉地纠正这种不良的积习。另外，负责办理婚姻登记的工作人员应该加强工作中的责任心，关心男女结婚后的幸福，切实掌握婚姻法中
  “男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”的规定；遇到未达结婚年龄就要结婚的人应该加以制止，并耐心地说明早婚的害处，劝告他们等到了够结婚年龄时再结婚。
