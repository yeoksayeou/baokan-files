The mutual aid and cooperation organizations in South China have developed greatly and have initially demonstrated their superiority in spring plowing and production.

According to incomplete statistics from Guangdong Province, there are more than 170 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 216,000 mutual aid teams. The number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounts for about 23 to 40 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. In Guangxi Province, the number of organized peasant households has reached more than 40 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province (in some districts and townships with better work, the organization rate reaches 70 to 80 percent; in districts and townships with a weaker foundation, the organization rate also reaches about 30 percent). According to statistics from more than 1,400 townships in Rongxian Special District, there are more than 2,300 permanent mutual aid teams, with an organization rate of 9 percent, which is more than three times higher than last year, and the number of temporary mutual aid teams is also more than twice as high as last year.

The mutual aid and cooperation organizations in South China have played a great role in promoting spring plowing and production. The spring plowing in the eastern and northern regions of Guangdong Province generally started seven days to half a month earlier than last year. On Hainan Island, except for Ledong and Baisha counties in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region, rice transplanting has been completed, which is half a month to 20 days earlier than last year. This year, under the guidance of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the broad masses of farmers in Guangxi Province have done a faster and better job in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. According to statistics from eight districts in Liujiang County alone, more than 500 water conservancy projects have been built, benefiting more than 50,000 mu of land, and can turn more than 2,400 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and 1,500 mu of single-cropping land into double-cropping land, which is estimated to increase grain production by more than 600,000 jin. The amount of fertilizer accumulated by the 70 agricultural production cooperatives in Rongxian Special District has more than doubled compared with last year, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers throughout the district under the leadership of the cooperatives has also increased by 20 to 30 percent compared with the same period last year. Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been cold and there has been little rain, and many farmers have been waiting and reluctant to sow seeds. However, under the promotion of local agricultural production cooperatives and permanent mutual aid teams, a surge of drought resistance and sowing has been launched in many areas, ensuring that the farming season is not missed.

    华南地区互助合作运动推动了春耕生产
    华南地区的互助合作组织已有很大发展，并在春耕生产中初步显示了优越性。
    广东省据不完全统计，已有农业生产合作社一百七十多个，互助组二十一万六千多个。参加互助合作组织的农户，占全省总农户数的百分之二十三到四十左右。广西省组织起来的农户，已达全省总农户的百分之四十以上（部分工作较好的区乡，组织面达百分之七、八十；基础较差的区乡，组织面也达百分之三十左右）。据容县专区一千四百多个乡的统计，常年互助组已有二千三百多个，组织面达百分之九，比去年增加三倍多，临时互助组也比去年增加两倍多。
    华南地区的互助合作组织在春耕生产中起了很大的推动作用。广东省东部和北部地区的春耕，一般都比去年提早七天到半个月左右。海南岛上除海南黎族苗族自治区的乐东、白沙等县外，插秧都已完毕，比去年提早了半个月到二十天。广西省广大农民今年在互助合作组织带动下，兴修水利和积肥工作都做得既快又好。仅柳江县八个区的统计，共修了水利五百多处，受益面积达五万多亩，并可使二千四百多亩旱田变成水田，一千五百多亩一糙变两糙，估计共可增产粮六十多万斤。容县专区七十个农业生产合作社的积肥数量都比去年增加一倍以上，全区农民在社的带动下，积肥量也都比去年同期增加百分之二、三十。入春以来，天寒少雨，不少农民有等待思想，迟迟不愿播种。但在当地农业生产合作社和常年互助组的推动下，许多地区掀起了抗旱播种的热潮，保证了不误农时。
