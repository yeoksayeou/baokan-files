Anhui and Hunan Provinces Launch Tea Pre-Purchase Programs

The spring tea picking season is approaching in the Huangshan tea region, known for its famous "Keemun" and "Tunxi Green" teas, and the Dabie Mountain tea region, known for "Lu'an Melon Seed" tea. The Anhui Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation and the Anhui Provincial Cooperative Federation are actively preparing for spring tea procurement and promptly launching pre-purchase programs to support tea farmers' production.

Anhui Province's tea production has greatly developed in recent years. Taking the毛茶(mao cha) output of 1950 as 100, it was 146 in 1951, 159 in 1952, and 167 in 1953. The tea plantation area has expanded every year. Last year alone, over 24,000 mu of tea gardens were restored and newly cultivated throughout the province. Under the guidance of the state's correct price policy and advanced tea-making technology, the quality of tea has continuously improved. Last year, the quality of Keemun black tea improved by 40% compared to 1952. The lives of tea farmers have also greatly improved.

This year, Anhui Province's tea production is expected to further increase on the basis of last year. According to some tea farmers in the Lu'an Special District, the tea is growing better this year than last year, and it is estimated that production will increase by 20% compared to last year. In order to support tea farmers' production and ensure the needs of domestic and international sales, the Anhui Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation has signed tea purchasing agreements and pre-purchase agreements with the Anhui Provincial Cooperative Federation. Currently, the tea pre-purchase program has begun in various counties of the Lu'an Special District. Qimen County in the Huizhou Special District is conducting key pre-purchase experiments in seven townships and is about to fully launch the pre-purchase program.

The Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation is actively preparing to purchase tea and launching pre-purchase programs. This year, Hunan Province plans to purchase 139% of the amount planned for purchase last year. The value of the tea prepared for export can be exchanged for more than 45,300 tons of steel. To do this work well, the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation held a tea evaluation training class at the beginning of this year. Yueyang, Lianyuan, Dongkou, Shaodong, Changsha, Xinhua, and other tea-producing areas have conducted propaganda and education for tea farmers, making them understand the benefits of selling tea to the state for the country and themselves. To facilitate tea farmers to sell tea, the number of purchasing points set up by the Hunan Provincial Tea Company in the tea area this year has increased by 24% compared to last year. At the same time, it has entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives in tea areas to purchase tea on its behalf and has transferred a group of cadres to various grassroots cooperatives in the tea area to provide specific assistance. In order to support tea farmers' production, the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation has signed a pre-purchase agreement with the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Affairs Bureau and launched a pre-purchase program.

    安徽湖南两省开展茶叶预购工作
    出产驰名全国的“祁红”、“屯绿”的黄山茶区和出产“六安瓜片”的大别山茶区的春茶已届采摘季节了。中国茶业公司安徽省公司和安徽省合作总社正在积极进行春茶收购前的各项准备，并及时开展预购工作，以扶植茶农生产。
    安徽省的茶叶生产，几年来有了很大发展。以一九五零年毛茶产量为一百，一九五一年为一百四十六，一九五二年为一百五十九，一九五三年为一百六十七；茶叶垦植面积每年都有扩展，去年一年中，全省恢复和新垦的茶园就在二万四千亩以上。在国家正确的价格政策和先进制茶技术的指导下，茶叶质量不断提高，去年祁门红茶的品质，就比一九五二年提高了百分之四十。茶农的生活也有了很大改善。
    今年安徽省的茶叶生产量将在去年的基础上有进一步的提高。据六安专区有些茶农反映：今年茶叶长得比去年更好，估计可比去年增产二成。为了扶持茶农生产，保证国内外销售的需要，中国茶业公司安徽省公司已和安徽省合作总社签订了茶叶代购协议和预购协议。现在，六安专区各县的茶叶预购工作已经开始；徽州专区祁门县正在七个乡进行茶叶预购重点试验，即将全面展开预购工作。

    中国茶业公司湖南省公司积极准备收购茶叶，开展预购工作。今年湖南省计划收购茶叶的数量为去年计划收购数量的百分之一百三十九；其中准备出口的茶叶，其价值可以换回四万五千三百多吨钢材。为了做好这个工作，中国茶业公司湖南省公司在今年年初举办了茶叶审评人员训练班。岳阳、涟源、洞口、邵东、长沙、新化等产茶区对茶农进行了宣传教育，使茶农懂得了把茶叶卖给国家对国家和自己的好处。为了便利茶农出售茶叶，今年湖南省茶业公司在茶区设的收购点比去年增加了百分之二十四。同时已委托茶区供销合作社代购茶叶，并抽调了一批干部前往茶区各基层合作社进行具体帮助。为了扶持茶农生产，中国茶业公司湖南省公司已和湖南省合作事业管理局签订预购协议，展开预购工作。
