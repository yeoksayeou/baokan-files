A New Path for an Old Factory
	—On the Technical Innovation Movement of Anshan Iron and Steel's Small Rolling Mill
	By Our Correspondent Liu Shiping

	Before the technical innovation movement, the Small Rolling Mill had outdated machinery and poor working conditions. In the second half of 1952, the Party General Branch of the Small Rolling Mill, based on the Party's policy of transforming existing enterprises, launched a mass technical innovation movement among all the factory's employees. By fully leveraging the collective creativity of the workers, implementing the principle of combining labor and technology, and following the advice of Soviet experts, this movement achieved tremendous success. It improved a series of production equipment under existing technical conditions, greatly increasing labor productivity. For example, with labor productivity in 1950 as 100 and 1951 as 145, after technical innovation, it significantly increased to 221 in 1952, and reached 338 last year. This reversed the previous situation of failing to meet state plans. In 1952, the Small Rolling Mill exceeded the state's production increase and conservation task ahead of schedule by six days and six hours. In 1953, it exceeded the state plan by 6.8 percent and completed the year's production task. This year, in January and February, it achieved new victories, comprehensively, balancedly, and safely completing the state's production plans. This accumulated huge funds for the country's socialist industrialization, undertook the glorious task of supporting industrial construction in various regions, improved working conditions, reduced physical labor, and greatly reduced occupational diseases and personal accidents among employees; at the same time, it improved the class consciousness of veteran technicians and the political and ideological levels of technical personnel.

	The mass technical innovation movement of the Small Rolling Mill (hereinafter referred to as the Small Mill) has opened up broad avenues for transforming the technical equipment of existing factories and mines and has pointed out new directions for labor competitions.

	Now let's take a look at how the Small Mill's path was traversed.

	I. The Emergence of the Rapid Rolling Method

	In June 1952, half the year was already over, but the Small Mill had not completed the state's production plan, owing the country 2,200 tons of steel. In April and May, defective products were produced continuously, and a worker, An Huimin, was crushed to death on the roller sleeve of a rolling mill.

	The situation was very serious. At that time, under the call of the Party, Anshan's factories and mines launched a production increase and conservation movement.

	The Party General Branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the Small Mill decided to launch the masses through the production increase and conservation movement, promote advanced experiences, and tap the potential of the enterprise.

	The Jiang Xingjia team of the B shift in the first workshop had always been at the forefront of production. Jiang Xingjia was also a member of the Youth League among the young workers and An Huimin's apprentice. After his master was crushed to death on the roller sleeve of the rolling mill, he was very sad for a time. After education from the Party and the Youth League, he realized ideologically that the old equipment was a mess left over from the period of the puppet regime, and if no measures were taken to improve it, it would be impossible to increase production. In order to commemorate his master, An Huimin, he often promoted safe production to the surrounding masses and united the comrades of the entire team to find ways to improve operating methods. Normally, other teams could only roll about 40 pieces every ten minutes, but his team once rolled 46 pieces.

	The Small Mill's trade union studied the advanced operating methods of the Jiang Xingjia team and decided to promote their advanced experience throughout the factory. At the same time, the leadership helped the Jiang Xingjia team test and improve the operating methods, increasing the number of steels rolled each time from two to three. Then the trade union organized nine teams from the first workshop to hold a joint performance. As a result, Chen Hongchun and others worked desperately, rolling only 45 pieces in ten minutes, while the Jiang Xingjia team, due to improved operating methods, rolled 52 pieces in ten minutes, shortening the cycle of rolling a piece of steel from 17 seconds to 11.5 seconds.

	Workers with conservative ideas, faced with the facts, were convinced of the advanced experience. They all said, "It's so fast! We can't do without learning advanced experience."

	From then on, the workers gave this rolling method a name, called "Rapid Rolling Method."

	The victory of the rapid rolling method encouraged all the factory's employees. But new problems emerged: the speed of rough rolling increased, and the rolling speed of finishing rolling lagged behind rough rolling. Originally, the steel billet, after rough rolling, had already been rolled into a fire-snake-like steel strip. When it entered the finishing rolling machine, it had to rely on workers using iron tongs to send it into the rolling groove entrance of the finishing rolling machine. Now, the speed of the rough rolling machine had increased, and the workers operating the finishing rolling machine could not keep up with sending the steel material from the rough rolling machine into the finishing rolling machine. Steel strips often piled up in front of the finishing rolling machine, unable to be rolled; when the steel cooled down, it had to be returned to the furnace for heating, and the specifications of the product were affected.

	The new imbalance in production raised a new key issue: increasing the rolling speed of the finishing rolling machine.

	II. Zhang Mingshan Creates the Anti-Looping Device

	The anti-looping device is an auxiliary production device on the finishing rolling machine. Before the anti-looping device, steel strips were fed into the rolling hole manually with iron tongs. This was the most dangerous process in the first workshop of the Small Mill, and accidents often occurred here. Gu Fengyao, a worker who used to operate this process, had been burned four times. Once, a steel strip jumped out of the groove and almost looped around his neck. Fortunately, he dodged quickly and avoided danger.

	Zhang Mingshan started working at the Small Mill when it opened. Counting his time as an apprentice fitter at the Anshan Machinery Repair Factory, he had been working for twenty years now. So he deeply knew the pain of the workers working on the finishing rolling machine. Sometimes, the old workers who worked with him would complain of pain in their backs or cramps in their legs, especially on cloudy or rainy days. Zhang Mingshan often said to people, "Every time they cried out, my heart ached too. While I was stretching their legs and rubbing their muscles, I thought, after liberation, everything has changed. We workers have become masters, and we are no longer subjected to the Japanese devils. But when will this scourge left by the Japanese devils be changed?"

	After the Small Mill started operations in 1949, Zhang Mingshan often thought about the anti-looping device that the Japanese had tested in the first workshop. He once picked up the old finishing rolling anti-looping device and spent two days and three nights cleaning it up. He tried rolling more than ten pieces of steel, but none of them went in. At that time, some people started to complain, "Take it down as soon as possible, don't delay our production!" Zhang Mingshan saw that it was really not working, and fearing that it would affect production, he took it down.

	In March 1950, Zhang Mingshan joined the Party. He became a glorious Communist Party member, determined to overcome all difficulties and continue his research to make the anti-looping device successful.

	In 1951, he had suggested the "anti-looping device" to an engineer in the factory, hoping to get his help and support. But the engineer poured cold water on him. He asked him, "Are you sure? The English and Americans haven't researched it successfully."

	"Japan didn't research it successfully, and neither did the English and Americans," Zhang Mingshan thought to himself. "Just because they didn't succeed, does that mean we can't succeed?"

	He had been diligently researching for three years, and with tenacious perseverance, he experimented repeatedly, first solving the problem of the loop's curvature, and then solving the problem of the flat iron standing on its side.

	In June, when the factory was discussing the production increase and conservation plan, other teams had proposed advanced experiences, and Chen Lingyan and Lu Baoshan of the spare parts team asked team leader Zhang Mingshan, "Others have rationalization suggestions, why don't we?" Zhang Mingshan held a meeting with them and resolved to successfully research the anti-looping device and solve a key problem for the entire factory.

	One day, Shen Jingquan, the organization committee member of the Party General Branch, saw Zhang Mingshan working on the anti-looping device in the workshop. Zhang Mingshan turned around and said to Shen Jingquan, "I'm researching that anti-looping device, I want to try it out." After Shen Jingquan reported to the General Branch Committee, Yan Ming, the Party General Branch Secretary and Factory Director, was very happy and immediately talked to Zhang Mingshan. Zhang Mingshan still had ideological concerns at the time, fearing that the test would affect production if it failed. He told Yan Ming, "I'm not sure if it will work. It would be best if you could give me four hours."

	"Why four hours?" Yan Ming asked.

	"It's better to have more time. If it doesn't work, I can find some lessons from failure here and modify it later; there is a cost to each experiment."

	But some people were still afraid that Zhang Mingshan's suggestion would not succeed.

	The Party General Branch also convened a technical research meeting of Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League cadres, old workers, and technicians in the workshop, and everyone discussed it in detail. At that time, in addition to Zhang Mingshan, there were also two programs proposed by electrical worker Xu Rongguo and others. Xu Rongguo's electric clamp was more complicated and could not keep up with production needs. Zhang Mingshan's program for trial-producing the anti-looping device was simpler and more in line with the principles, the equipment was not complicated, and it saved money. Finally, it was decided to adopt Zhang Mingshan's suggestion. The Party General Branch decided that organization committee member Shen Jingquan, first workshop director Zhang Yongchun, and trade union chairman Hu Yunxiu would help Zhang Mingshan improve the anti-looping device.

	The factory director, based on the Party's decision and the advice of Soviet experts, included Zhang Mingshan's suggestion to transform the finishing rolling machine and trial-produce the anti-looping device in the technical measures plan for July. He also approved eight hours of trial time for Zhang Mingshan.

	Zhang Mingshan, who had been diligently researching the anti-looping device for three years, received the support of the leadership, and the joy in his heart was indescribable. During the major overhaul in August, he cooperated with Lu Baoshan and Chen Lingyan to actively make the anti-looping device, preparing to conduct the test before National Day.

	Before the test, Kang Zhaowen, deputy secretary of the Party General Branch, had a conversation with Zhang Mingshan. On the one hand, Zhang Mingshan saw the Party's attention and felt naturally very excited compared to the past; on the other hand, he was afraid that the test would fail and he would be embarrassed in front of everyone. Kang Zhaowen patiently told him, "The Party guarantees that all preparations will be made before the test, and even if the test fails, we will continue to support your research work." At the same time, he called on the Party members participating in the test to actively help Zhang Mingshan. Because Zhang Mingshan did not know how to operate the machine, everyone should ensure that the finishing rolling machine was adjusted well during the test. The factory director also designated old technician Liu Jiacai to be responsible for the inlet guide plate, first workshop foreman Fu Zhiguo to focus on the outlet nozzle, Gao Xianwu to guard the baffle, and technician Wu Liangya to make technical measurements and check quality, and first workshop director Zhang Yongchun to maintain overall safety.

	The test began, and the first steel didn't go in. Zhang Mingshan was very nervous, his face flushed red. Kang Zhaowen quickly went over to comfort him, "It's okay, there's hope. As long as the steel strip can pass through the anti-looping device, it's fine." When the second piece was tested, the steel strip, like a fire snake, jumped out of the groove. The visitors rushed to the finishing rolling machine, cheering and celebrating Zhang Mingshan's victory.

	After the successful test of the anti-looping device, the production capacity of the finishing rolling process increased by 25 percent. Making the anti-looping device only cost 3 million yuan, and compared with the actual annual production volume in 1953 before the anti-looping device, it could increase the country's production by 22 billion yuan.

	Zhang Mingshan's creation paved the way for the vast number of workers to invent and create.

	The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a city-wide award ceremony, awarding Zhang Mingshan the glorious title of Special-Class Labor Model of the city. Lu Baoshan and Chen Lingyan, who helped Zhang Mingshan research the anti-looping device, also received awards. The Anshan Municipal Committee and the Party General Branch of the Small Mill timely praised Zhang Mingshan, criticized conservative technical viewpoints, and guided individual and scattered inventions and creations among the masses in a collective direction.

	III. The Automatic Steel Pusher Succeeded

	Old worker Lu Naitao of the heating shift, under Zhang Mingshan's influence, also reassembled the steel pusher he had researched in the past, preparing to convert it into an automatic steel pusher to overcome the disconnection between the heating and rough rolling processes.

	One day, Old Lu consulted technician Wu Liangya, saying, "Old Wu, think of a way, can I pick up that steel pusher I researched in the past and try it again?"

	Wu Liangya was a young technician who liked to study problems. He and Old Lu worked in the same workshop and got along well, and they talked well. When Wu Liangya heard Old Lu's words, he thought to himself, "Old Lu has eighteen years of work experience and is a veteran technician. He has rich practical experience in the equipment and operation of the heating furnace. In order to replace manual steel pushing and eliminate the occupational diseases of heating workers, of course I should support his suggestion." They submitted a suggestion to the factory director to transform the steel pusher and suggested replacing the original motor with one that could speed up the pusher of the steel pusher. The factory did not have that kind of spare part at the time, and the factory director immediately wrote a note to get it from the warehouse. After the motor was installed, there was a shortage of water pipes, and the factory director found someone to borrow them from another factory. When electricians, riveters, and welders were needed to cooperate in the creation, the factory director asked the director of the repair shop to dispatch five workers to cooperate. The leadership's positive attitude towards actively supporting technical improvement powerfully encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for creation.

	The speed of the pusher was solved. Now the power machinery controlled by electricity had to be solved. Wu Liangya designed an automatic control circuit diagram. He was not sure whether this diagram was suitable or not. He found Old Lu to study it, but Old Lu didn't understand electricity very well. Finally, he found electricians Li Chunquan, Yang Pengfei, and Sun Shiping to study it together. According to their experience, they modified the design of the diagram, and then they began to experiment. As a result, a series of new technical problems occurred during the experiment, and they could not continue the test.

	In times of difficulty, the determination and support of the leadership are most able to encourage the workers' emotions and improve their confidence. The leadership decided to mobilize the strength of the factory's mechanical and electrical workers to help them solve the difficulties and complete their experiment. The factory director and the trade union chairman jointly convened a forum for veteran workers and technicians. At the meeting, everyone's opinions were concentrated, and fifteen mechanical problems were solved separately, and the electrical problems of the coordinated operation of the loading machine and the steel drawing machine were also solved.

	In the second experiment, the automatic steel pusher was completely good to use. The worker sat far away from the heating furnace, and at the touch of a button, it quickly pulled out the steel according to people's will.

	Wu Liangya received a great education in this collective creation; he said with emotion, "The wisdom of the workers is truly infinite; the power of the collective is truly invincible."

	After the successful trial production of the automatic steel pusher, it was found that the bottom of the heating furnace was uneven, which affected the speed of steel output. This problem was studied for a long time, but it could not be solved. Finally, after research by Soviet experts, the steel pushing groove in the furnace was changed to a heat-resistant steel groove, which completely solved the problem of the uneven furnace bottom. By December 1952, the automatic steel pusher was officially in use.

	Following Lu Naitao and Wu Liangya, Kang Zhaowen, deputy secretary of the Party General Branch, and assistant engineer Zhou Renyuan improved the steel turning machine on the south side of the rough rolling mill. Under their encouragement, workers throughout the factory launched a wave of rationalization proposals. Some small creations were solved by workers chatting with workers from other factories while watching a play. Some small creations were solved by the workers before they went to the leading cadres. They didn't even use a penny of public money to solve major problems. For example, electricians Sun Shiping, Li Chunquan, and Yang Pengfei made an automatic cooling bed to replace manual operation. The materials they used were only a small iron plate, worth no more than 5,000 yuan, but the wealth created was worth more than 100 million yuan.

	From June to December 1952, among the fifteen mechanized and automated production equipment created by the factory's workers and technicians, twelve were collective creations. Among them, there were ten major inventions and creations, which basically solved the problem of production imbalance in each process of the entire factory and improved working conditions.

	In order to turn the mechanization and automation technical innovation movement into a regular activity, the Small Mill organized an automation group in December 1952, absorbing veteran technicians, technical personnel, and staff members to participate. Through the group, they specifically helped employees study rationalization proposals, "one person proposes, everyone studies," concentrating everyone's wisdom and experience, learning from each other's strengths, and giving full play to the power of collective creation.

	IV. Thanks to Soviet Experts

	The achievements of the Small Rolling Mill in carrying out the technical innovation movement are inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. The help of Soviet experts is not limited to advanced technology, but also to their thinking and style. After Zhang Mingshan's anti-looping device was proposed, before it was included in the technical measures plan, the factory director asked the expert, who said in a firm tone, "The workers' creation should be supported, and they should be allowed to do experiments, because no creation is successful at once." After the anti-looping device was successfully tested, the expert said to the factory director, "This is the great power of the Chinese working class." Soviet experts helped our leading cadres ideologically to value the workers' creation.

	After the anti-looping device was installed on the finishing rolling machine, the quality of the rolled products was not good, and there were lines on the steel strips. Later, an expert was invited to look at it. He examined everything from the nozzle and the baffle to every small screw. After his careful research, he found the problem and improved the outlet nozzle. The quality of the rolled steel strips improved, and each steel was smooth. The help of Soviet experts made Zhang Mingshan's anti-looping device more practical and perfect.

	When the automatic steel pusher had been initially tested successfully, the unevenness of the furnace bottom caused by iron oxide scale in the furnace affected the advancement of the steel drawing machine. When the research began, engineer Wei Mingrang wanted to use "air hammer to top the steel." This method was easy to hang empty hooks, and it was only semi-automatic steel drawing, which could not supply steel for rough rolling at all. Later, the expert's suggestion was implemented, and a heat-resistant steel pushing groove was installed in the furnace. This heat-resistant steel pushing groove would not be burned or bonded to iron scale at a furnace temperature of around 1,500 degrees, so the furnace bottom would not be uneven due to the solidification of the iron scale. Wu Liangya was deeply moved by the expert's technical expertise and selfless help. He said, "The unevenness of the furnace bottom was the last problem for the success or failure of the automatic steel pusher, but it was the most difficult and complex of all the problems. Everyone spent a lot of effort on this matter, but no one could think of a solution. Thanks to the expert's enthusiastic help, the problem of the uneven furnace bottom was completely solved."

	V. The Production of the Small Mill Has Changed

	After more than a year of mechanization and automation technical innovation movement, the production equipment and working environment of the Small Mill have changed.

	Now, the steel billet is placed on the material conveying machine by an automatic crane, automatically loaded into the heating furnace, and after being heated, is pushed out by an automatic steel pusher, sent to the rough rolling machine, and after automatic steel turning and rolling, it is then passed through the automatic anti-looping device of the finishing rolling process, and then cut into a certain length by an automatic cutting machine to become a product.

	The current situation is as the workers say: "In the past, we were in water and fire, being chased by the machines to work. Now, we sit next to the machines and watch the machines work."

	The achievements of the Small Mill fully demonstrate the infinite wisdom of the working class; as long as we are good at giving play to the creativity and enthusiasm of workers and technicians, continuously improve technology, and conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, any difficulties can be overcome.

	The reason why the Small Mill can achieve this achievement is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party. They always put the completion of the state's production plan in the first place, followed the principle of balanced production, combined regular work, and carried out the mechanization and automation technical innovation movement in the production increase and conservation movement. In the past two years, they have not only completed the state's production plan but also improved production equipment and working conditions. In 1953, they had another eleven trial-produced mechanical equipment put into production. In the first quarter of this year, in the process of establishing a responsibility system for equipment maintenance and repair, they thoroughly checked the problems existing in the work of the past year, and decided to continue to consolidate and improve the technical innovation movement, so that the production increase and conservation competition can be further advanced on the basis of constantly improving the technical level.

	Because they fully exploited the potential of existing enterprises in the technical innovation movement, they accumulated funds for the country's socialist industrialization. The actual production volume of the anti-looping device alone increased the country's production by 22 billion yuan in 1953; at the same time, the products of the Small Mill, such as steel bars for building materials, steel ropes for mining and well digging, and various tube blanks for heating pipes and water pipes, etc., all timely supported the country's key construction projects; and in the movement, they cultivated worker cadres and technical forces for the country. The Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League cadres of the entire factory were all promoted from the workers of the factory. For example, Deputy Director Zhang Mingshan and Technician Lu Naitao were all cadres promoted from veteran workers; the technical level of young workers also generally improved in the movement, with 70 percent of the young workers promoted two grades; young technician Wu Liangya was also promoted to assistant engineer and deputy director. They not only cultivated technical forces for the factory but also transferred technical workers to key projects.

	The Small Mill, in transforming old enterprises, has opened up a new path for the technical transformation of existing enterprises throughout the country.

    旧工厂的新道路
    ——记鞍钢小型轧钢厂的技术革新运动
    本报记者　刘时平
    小型轧钢厂在没有开展技术革新运动以前，机械设备很陈旧，劳动条件也是恶劣的。一九五二年下半年中共小型轧钢厂的党总支依据党对原有企业的改造方针，发动全厂职工开展了群众性技术革新运动。由于高度发挥了职工的集体创造精神，贯彻了劳动与技术相结合的方针，执行了苏联专家的建议，这一运动获得了巨大的成绩。在现有的技术条件上，改进了一系列的生产设备，大大提高了劳动生产率。如以一九五○年劳动生产率为一○○，一九五一年为一四五，技术革新后，一九五二年，就显著地提高为二二一，去年已达三三八。从而扭转了以前完不成国家计划的情况，一九五二年，小型轧钢厂提前六天零六小时超额完成了国家增产节约任务。一九五三年又超过国家计划百分之六点八，完成了全年的生产任务。今年一、二两月份更以新的胜利，全面、均衡、安全地完成了国家的生产计划。为国家社会主义工业化积累了巨额资金，担负起支援各地工业建设的光荣任务，并改进了劳动作业条件，减轻了体力劳动，职工的职业病和人身事故大大减少；同时提高了老技术工人的阶级觉悟和技术人员的政治思想水平。
    小型轧钢厂（以下简称小型厂）群众性的技术革新运动，为改造原有厂矿的技术设备开辟了广阔的道路，为劳动竞赛指出了新的方向。
    现在让我们看一看小型厂的道路，是怎样走过来的。
      一、快速轧钢法的出现
    一九五二年六月，一年已要过去半年了，可是小型厂没有完成国家的生产计划，亏欠了国家两千二百吨钢材。四、五两月又连续出废品，还有一个工人安惠民在轧钢机的辊套上被压死。
    情况是十分严重的，就在那个时候，鞍山各厂矿在党的号召下开展了增产节约运动。
    小型厂的党总支、行政、工会和青年团就决定通过增产节约运动，发动群众，推广先进经验，挖掘企业的潜在能力。
    一车间乙班姜兴家小组，在生产中，向来是走在前面的。姜兴家又是一个青工中的团员，安惠民的徒弟。当他的师傅在轧钢机的辊套上压死后，他有一度很难过。经过党和青年团的教育，他从思想上认识到旧的设备，是敌伪时期留下来的烂摊子，如果不想办法改进，要想提高生产，是不可能的。他为了纪念师傅安惠民，经常向周围的群众宣传安全生产，并团结全组的同志，想办法改进操作方法。平常别的小组每十分钟只能轧四十来根，他们小组有一次轧了四十六根。
    小型厂的工会研究了姜兴家小组的先进操作法，决定在全厂推广他们的先进经验，同时，领导上又帮助姜兴家小组，试验改进操作法，每次轧钢由两根增加到三根。接着工会组织了一车间的九个小组，同时举行了一次联合表演。结果，陈洪春等拼命干，十分钟只轧了四十五根，而姜兴家小组由于改进了操作方法，十分钟就轧了五十二根，轧一根钢的周期，从十七秒缩短到了十一秒五。
    有保守思想的工人，在事实面前，信服了先进经验。都说：“真快啊！不学习先进经验可不成啦。”
    从此，工人给这种轧钢法起了一个名字，叫做“快速轧钢法”。
    快速轧钢法的胜利，鼓舞了全厂的职工。可是又出来了新的问题：毛轧的速度加快了，光轧的压延速度又落后于毛轧，原来钢胚经过毛轧后，已经轧成火蛇一样的钢条。进到光轧机，要依靠工人用铁钳把它送进光轧机的轧槽入口。现在，毛轧机的速度增加了，操纵光轧机的工人，怎么也来不及把从毛轧机过来的钢料，送入光轧机，光轧机前常常堆着钢条，轧不过来；钢冷却了，又得回炉加热，产品的规格就受到影响。
    生产上新的不平衡，提出了新的关键问题：提高光轧机的压延速度。
    二、张明山创造反围盘
    反围盘是光轧机上的一个附属生产设备。没有反围盘以前，是用人工用铁钳夹钢条送入轧孔，这是在小型厂一车间最危险的一道工序，事故就常常出在这里。过去在这一工序操作的工人顾凤耀曾四次受过烫伤。有一次，钢条跳出跑槽，差一点儿套在他的脖子上，幸亏他躲的快，才避免了危险。
    张明山从小型厂开火，就开始干起，算上他以前在鞍钢机修厂学钳工的一段，到现在，已经整整干了二十几个年头了。所以深深知道在光轧机上干活的工人的痛苦。有时候，和他在一起工作的老工人，每逢阴天下雨，不是这个腰痛，就是那个抽筋，痛的直叫唤。张明山常对人们说：“他们一叫唤，我的心也发痛，我一边给他们伸腿揉筋，一边想，解放后，什么都变了样，咱工人当了主人啦，再不受鬼子气啦，可是鬼子留下的这个祸害，到什么时候才能变样呢？”
    一九四九年小型厂开工后，张明山常想起日本人在一车间试过反围盘的事，他曾经把以前那个光轧反围盘拣回来，收拾了两天三宿，试轧了十多根钢，也没钻进去，当时就有人吵吵开啦：“趁早卸下来吧，别耽误咱们生产了！”张明山瞅着实在不好使，又怕影响生产，就卸下来了。
    一九五○年三月，张明山入党了，他成为一个光荣的共产党员，决心要克服一切困难，继续研究，把反围盘弄成功。
    一九五一年，他曾经向厂里的一个工程师提出过“反围盘”的建议，原想得到他的帮助和支持，没想到那个工程师却给他浇了一盆冷水。问他，“你有把握吗？英、美都没研究成。”
    “日本没研究成，英、美也没有。”张明山自己想着：“他们不成，就不准咱们成吗？”
    他一直刻苦钻研了三年，以坚韧的毅力，反得试验，先解决了围盘的弧度问题，又解决了扁铁侧立的问题。
    六月里，厂里讨论增产节约计划时，别的班都有先进经验提出来，备品班的陈令言和鲁宝善向班长张明山提出：“别人有合理化建议，为什么咱们没有？”张明山和他们开了一个会，下定决心要把反围盘研究成功，为全厂解决一个关键问题。
    有一天，党总支组织委员沈景泉，在车间看到张明山琢磨反围盘，张明山回过头来向沈景泉提出：“我研究那反围盘，想试试看。”沈景泉向总支委员会提出后，党总支书记兼厂长燕鸣很高兴，立时就找张明山谈话。张明山当时还有思想顾虑，怕试不成影响生产。他向燕鸣表示：“好不好使，可没准，最好能给我四个钟头。”
    “为什么要四个钟头？”燕鸣问。
    “时间多点好，万一不好使，我能从这里找出几个失败的教训，往后再改；试验一次才有代价。”
    但是有的人还怕张明山的建议不能成功。
    党总支又召集了一次车间的党、行政、工会、青年团干部和老工人、技术员的技术研究会，大家详细地讨论了一次。当时，除张明山外，还有电气工徐荣国等提出的两个方案。徐荣国的电气夹钳，比较复杂，赶不上生产的需要。张明山试制反围盘的方案，比较简单并且合乎原理，设备不复杂，又省钱。最后肯定采纳张明山的建议。党总支决定由组织委员沈景泉和一车间主任张永春、工会主席胡允修帮助张明山改进反围盘的设备。
    厂长根据党的决定和苏联专家的意见，把张明山改造光轧机试制反围盘的建议订在七月份的技术措施计划中。并批准了给张明山八个钟头的试验时间。
    张明山刻苦钻研了三年的反围盘，得到了领导上的支持，心眼里的高兴，是难以形容的。他趁八月份大检修的时候，和鲁宝善、陈令言合作，积极制做反围盘，准备在国庆节前进行试验。
    试验前，党总支副书记康兆文找张明山谈过一次话，张明山一方面看到党的重视，与过去对比起来，心里自然很激动；一方面又怕试不成，在大家面前丢丑。康兆文耐心地告诉他：“党保证在试验前把一切准备工作做好，即使试验不成，还要继续支持你的研究工作。”同时号召参加试验的党员，积极帮助张明山，张明山不会操纵机器，大家要保证在试验时把光轧机调整好。厂长又指定老技术工人刘家财负责入孔导板，一车间的工长傅治国专瞅出口嘴子，高贤武守住挡板，技术员吴良亚作技术测定和检查质量，一车间主任张永春维护全面的安全。
    试验开始了，头一根钢就没进去。张明山的心情非常紧张，脸色涨得通红，康兆文赶快走过去安慰他：“不要紧，有门。只要钢条能从反围盘过去，就行。”试第二根的时候，钢条像火蛇一样，从跑槽里蹿出来了。参观的人，拥向光轧机，齐声欢呼，庆祝张明山的胜利。
    反围盘试验成功后，使光轧的生产能力提高了百分之二十五。制做反围盘只需要三百万元，在一九五三年的全年实际生产量和没有反围盘以前相比，能给国家增产二百二十亿元。
    张明山的创造，为广大的工人发明创造开辟了道路。
    中共鞍山市委、鞍山市人民政府和市总工会召开了全市性的发奖大会，授给张明山全市特等劳动模范的光荣称号。帮助张明山研究反围盘的鲁宝善、陈令言也都得到了奖励。鞍山市委和小型厂的党总支及时地通过表扬张明山，批判保守的技术观点，把群众中个体的、分散的创造发明，引上了集体的方向。
      三、自动推钢机成功了
    加热班的老工人卢乃涛在张明山的影响下，也把过去研究过的推钢机，重新收拾起来，准备改成自动推钢机，克服加热与毛轧两道工序的脱节现象。
    有一天，老卢找技术员吴良亚商量，他说：“老吴，想想办法，我过去研究的那个推钢机，能不能再拣起来试试。”
    吴良亚是一个年轻的技术员，很喜欢钻研问题。他和老卢在一个车间里工作，相处很好，谈也谈得来。吴良亚听了老卢的话，心里想：“老卢已经有十八年的工龄，是一个老技术工人，他对加热炉的设备和操作，有丰富的实际经验。为了代替人力推钢，消灭加热工人的职业病，当然应该支持他的建议。”他们向厂长提出改造推钢机的建议，并建议将原有的马达换一个，以便加快推钢机的推杆。当时厂里没有那种备品，厂长马上批条子，叫到仓库里去领。马达安好了，又缺水管，厂长就找人到外厂去借。创造中需要电工、铆工、焊工配合的时候，厂长就让修理车间主任调派五名工人配合工作。领导上对于改进技术的积极支持态度，有力地鼓舞了工人的创造热情。
    推杆速度解决了。又要解决电气操纵的动力机械。吴良亚设计了一个自动控制线路图，这张图合适不合适，他自己也没有把握，找老卢研究，老卢又不大懂电气，最后又找电工李春泉、杨鹏飞和孙世平一起研究，按照他们的经验，修改了设计的图样，然后他们开始试验。结果，在试验中，又发生了一连串新的技术问题，试不下去了。
    在困难的时候，领导上的决心和支持，是最能鼓舞工人情绪和提高工人信心的。领导上决定动员全厂的机械和电气工人的力量，帮助他们解决困难，完成他们的试验。厂长和工会主席共同召开了一次老工人、技术员的座谈会，会上集中大家的意见，分别解决了十五项机械问题，也解决了装入机与抽钢机的联系操作的电气问题。
    第二次试验时，自动推钢机就完全好用了。工人坐在离加热炉很远的地方，一按电钮，它就随着人们的意志，很快地出钢了。
    吴良亚在这次集体创造中，受到了很大的教育；他感动地说：“工人的智慧，真是无穷无尽的；集体的力量，真是无坚不摧的。”
    自动推钢机试制成功了，又发现加热炉炉底不平，影响出钢的速度。这个问题，研究了很长时间，没有能够解决，最后，经过苏联专家的研究，把炉内的推钢槽，改为耐热钢槽，才彻底解决了炉底不平的问题。到一九五二年十二月，自动推钢机就正式使用了。
    继卢乃涛与吴良亚之后，还有党总支副书记康兆文和助理工程师周任源，改进了毛轧南边的翻钢机。在他们的鼓舞下，全厂工人掀起了开展合理化建议的热潮，甚至有一个工人在看戏时，和别厂的工人在聊天中，解决了改进一件生产工具的方法。有些小创造，工人弄好后，才去找领导干部，他们甚至没有用公家一文钱，就解决了大问题。如电工孙世平、李春泉、杨鹏飞三个人做了一个自动冷却床，代替了人力操作。他们所用的材料，仅仅是一块小铁板，价值不过五千元，而创造的财富值一亿多元。
    从一九五二年六月到十二月的七个月中，全厂工人和技术人员创造的十五件机械化自动化的生产设备中，有十二件是集体创造的。其中有十件重大创造发明，基本上解决了全厂各道工序的生产不平衡问题，改善了劳动条件。
    为了把机械化自动化的技术革新运动，变为经常工作。小型厂在一九五二年十二月组织了自动化小组，吸收老技术工人、技术人员和职员参加。通过小组来具体帮助职工研究合理化建议，“一人提出，大家研究”，集中大家的智慧与经验，取长补短，发挥集体创造的力量。
    四、感谢苏联专家
    小型轧钢厂开展技术革新运动的成就是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的，苏联专家的帮助，不仅限于先进的技术，并且还在于他们的思想和作风。张明山的反围盘提出来后，在订入技术措施计划之前，厂长曾经问过专家，专家以坚定的口吻说：“工人的创造应当支持，应当允许他做试验，因为任何创造都不是一下子就成功的。”反围盘试验成功后，这位专家对厂长说：“这是中国工人阶级的伟大力量。”苏联专家从思想上帮助我们的领导干部重视工人的创造。
    光轧机上安上反围盘以后，轧出的产品质量不好，钢条上划的都是一道一道的纹。后来请专家来看，他从嘴子、挡板、一直检查到每个小螺丝，经过他的认真研究，找到了毛病，改进了出口嘴子，轧出来的钢条质量提高了，每根钢都是光溜溜的。苏联专家的帮助，使得张明山的反围盘更加切合实用和完善了。
    当自动推钢机已经初步试验成功后，因炉内氧化铁皮造成的炉底不平，影响了抽钢机的推进。开始研究的时候，工程师魏铭让要用“气锤顶钢”，这种办法，容易挂空勾，而且只是半自动化抽钢，根本供应不上毛轧用钢。后来执行了专家的建议，在炉内安装了耐热推钢槽。这种耐热推钢槽，在炉温一千五百度左右，不会被烧化，也不会黏结铁皮，所以炉底也就不会因铁皮的凝结而不平。吴良亚对专家的技术精湛和无私的帮助，深受感动，他说：“炉底不平，这是自动推钢机成败的最后一项问题，但它却是所有问题中最困难和复杂的。为了这件事，大家花费许多脑筋，都没想出办法来。由于专家的热心帮助，炉底不平的问题才彻底解决了。”
      五、小型厂的生产变了样
    小型厂经过了机械化自动化的技术革新运动，不过一年多的时间，生产设备和劳动环境，已经变了样。
    现在钢胚用自动吊车放到运料机上，自动装入加热炉，烧好后，被自动推钢机推出来，送到毛轧机，经过自动翻钢和压延，又窜过光轧的自动围盘，再被自动剪断机剪成一定长度，就成为产品。
    目前的情况，正如工人们所说：“过去是在水里火里，叫机器撵着干，现在是坐在机器旁边，看着机器干。”
    小型厂的这种成就，充分说明了工人阶级的无限智慧；只要善于发挥工人和技术人员的创造性和积极性，不断提高技术，认真执行苏联专家的建议，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    小型厂所以能够取得这种成就，是与党的正确领导分不开的。他们经常把完成国家的生产计划放到第一位，按照均衡生产的原则，结合经常工作，在增产节约运动中，开展了机械化自动化的技术革新运动，两年来，既完成了国家的生产计划，又改进了生产设备和劳动条件。一九五三年，他们又有十一件试制成功的机械设备，投入生产。今年第一季度，他们在建立设备维护检修责任制的过程中，彻底检查了过去一年来工作中存在的问题，决定继续巩固并提高技术革新运动，使增产节约竞赛在不断提高的技术水平上，再向前推进一步。
    由于他们在技术革新运动中，充分发挥了现有企业的潜在能力，所以为国家社会主义工业化积累了资金。仅反围盘的实际生产量，在一九五三年一年内就为国家增产了二百二十亿元；同时小型厂的产品，如做建筑材料的钢筋，开矿掘井的钢绳，以及做暖气管、水管的各种管胚，等等，都及时地支援了国家的重点建设；并在运动中，为国家培养了工人干部和技术力量。全厂的党、行政、工会、青年团的干部都是从本厂工人中提拔起来的。如副厂长张明山，技术员卢乃涛等都是从老工人中提拔起来的干部；青年工人的技术水平，在运动中，也普遍提高了，有百分之七十的青工升了两级；青年技术员吴良亚也被提升为助理工程师兼副厂长。他们不仅为本厂培养了技术力量，而且向重点工程输送了技术工人。
    小型厂在改造旧企业中，为全国现有企业的技术改造工作，开辟了一条新的道路。
