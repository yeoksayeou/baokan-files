Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd. The partial machinery, boilers, and auxiliary equipment of the newly built Chongqing 507 Power Plant began integrated start-up on the evening of March 31st and will soon be generating electricity.

Now, various motors in the factory building are humming incessantly. The trial operation areas of each workshop present a new atmosphere. Permanent lighting equipment has been installed in transportation and operation areas. Painting and varnishing work has been finalized; various pipes and containers have been painted in many different colors. To facilitate worker operation, the names of many important pieces of equipment have been written on them, and many switches, valves, and operating panels have been painted with symbols indicating opening and closing directions. The pointers of various automatic recording instruments are recording various temperatures and pressures on the recording charts. Equipment system diagrams have been hung on the freshly painted walls of the workshops.

To ensure the safety and reliability of the integrated start-up, many pieces of equipment at the 507 Power Plant began trial operations a month ago. By the afternoon of March 29th, the boiler was ignited, and at 12:00 midnight, the boiler, having reached sufficient pressure, sent steam to the turbine workshop. At this time, the turbine workshop was intensively carrying out pre-start-up checks. For three consecutive nights, Soviet experts worked beside the machinery until late at night. During the start-up period, the machine's operation was good. After a short period of shutdown inspection and electrical testing of the generator, the power plant will be able to conduct trial power transmission to various factories and mines.

    新建重庆五零七电力厂很快就要试行送电
    【新华社重庆三日电】新建重庆五零七电力厂的部分机炉和附属设备，已在三月三十一日晚开始整套启动，很快就要发电了。
    现在，厂房中的各种马达正在不息地轰鸣着。各车间的试车区域呈现出一片新的气象。在交通和运转的地方，永久性的照明设备已安装起来。粉刷、油漆工作已最后结束；各种管道和容器已添上多种不同的颜色。为了便于工人操作，许多重要的设备已写上名称，许多开关、截门、操作盘也已漆上表示开闭方向的符号。各种自动纪录仪表的指针已在纪录表上记录着各种温度和压力。在粉刷一新的车间墙壁上，设备系统图已悬挂出来了。
    为了保证整套启动工作的安全可靠，五零七电力厂许多设备在一个月以前就开始了试车。到三月二十九日下午，锅炉点火了，晚上十二点钟，升足了压力的锅炉就把蒸汽送到透平车间。这时透平车间正在紧张地进行启动前的检查工作。接连三个晚上，苏联专家都在机器旁边工作到深夜。在启动期间，机器运转情况良好。电厂再经过短时期的停车检查和发电机的电气试验以后，就可以向各厂矿试行送电了。
