    National Subscription to Public Bonds Reaches 6.4 Trillion Yuan
    Payment Amount Reaches 25% of Subscription Amount
   [Reported by this newspaper] The people of the whole country enthusiastically subscribed to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. As of March 24th, the subscription amount reached 6,425.33 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan of 6 trillion yuan by 7.09%. Among them, the subscription amount from workers and staff exceeded the original plan by 110.74%; the subscription amount from industry and commerce and citizens exceeded the original plan by 17.56%; in rural areas, because farmers have been busy selling surplus grain, conducting general elections, and preparing for spring plowing in the past few months, promotion only started in most areas in March, and now farmers are enthusiastically subscribing.
    The broad masses of workers and staff across the country played an active and exemplary role in this bond subscription. The subscription amount of workers and staff in North China, East China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia exceeded the original plan by more than one time; the subscription amount of workers and staff in Northeast China, Central South China, and Southwest China exceeded the original plan by more than 80%. Currently, workers and staff in various regions are actively making payments.
    Private industrialists and businessmen in major and medium-sized cities across the country have also basically or overfulfilled their bond subscription quotas, and industrialists and businessmen in some small towns are still subscribing. However, the payment progress is relatively slow.
    In the vast rural areas across the country, due to the late start of bond subscriptions, coupled with the arrival of the production season and the heavy workload in rural areas, the subscription phase is currently underway. Judging from individual areas that started earlier, farmers are very enthusiastic about subscribing to public bonds, and the subscription amount has exceeded the original plan. For example, in Hunan and Ningxia provinces, according to incomplete statistics, the subscription amount of farmers has exceeded the original plan by about 10%.
    As of March 25th, the payment amount from people in various regions had reached more than 1,668 billion yuan, accounting for slightly more than 25% of the subscription amount. In the payment process, private industrialists and businessmen are paying more slowly. Public bond promotion committees and federations of industry and commerce in various regions are strengthening publicity and mobilization to strive for early payment of public bond funds into the treasury.

    全国认购公债达六万四千多亿元
    缴款数字已达认购数字的百分之二十五
   【本报讯】全国人民踊跃认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债，到三月二十四日止，认购数字已达六万四千二百五十三亿三千多万元，超过原定计划六万亿元百分之七点零九。其中职工认购数字超过原定计划百分之一百一十点七四；工商界及市民认购数字超过原定计划百分之一十七点五六；农村因数月来农民忙于出卖余粮，进行普选及准备春耕生产，大部分地区在三月份才开始推销，现在农民正在热烈认购中。
    全国广大职工在这次认购公债中，发挥了积极的模范的作用。华北、华东、西北、内蒙古等地区的职工，认购公债数字超过原定计划一倍以上；东北、中南、西南等地区的职工认购数字超过原定计划百分之八十以上。现在，各地职工已在积极缴款。
    全国各大、中城市的私营工商业者，认购公债数字也基本或超额完成了，部分小城镇的工商业者还在认购中。但缴款进度比较迟缓。
    全国广大农村由于认购公债开始较晚，加上目前生产季节已到，农村工作较为繁重，现正在认购阶段中。按个别开展较早的地区来看，农民认购公债甚为踊跃，认购数字都超额完成。如湖南、宁夏两省的农民，认购公债数字，据不完全统计，已超过原定计划百分之十左右。
    各地人民缴款数字，到三月二十五日止，已达一万六千六百八十多亿元，占认购数字的百分之二十五强。在缴款中，私营工商业者缴款比较迟缓，各地公债推销委员会和工商业联合会正加强宣传动员，争取公债款早日缴纳入库。
