    The Capital Literary and Art Circles Hold Evening Party to Congratulate Winners of Mass Song Awards

    [This newspaper reported] The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held an evening party at the Beijing Hotel on the 23rd to congratulate the songwriters who won awards in the national mass song awards over the past three years. More than 300 people from the capital's cultural and artistic circles, the winners, and performers attended the meeting.

    At the meeting, Liu Zhiming, Zheng Zhenduo, Li Zhaobing, and Lü Ji delivered congratulatory speeches to the glorious award-winning songwriters on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, and the Chinese Musicians Association, respectively. Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, said in his speech: As can be seen from the awards, the creation of mass songs in our country has achieved remarkable results. These songs reflect the life, thoughts, and feelings of the Chinese people after liberation, and prominently reflect the Chinese people's optimism, revolutionary spirit, and internationalism. He encouraged songwriters to continue their efforts and cooperate more closely with literary and art groups to create more and better works.

    Wang Xin, the author of the first-prize song "Ode to the Motherland," and Sun Zhenhua, a worker-composer and the author of the third-prize song "For a Happy Tomorrow," also spoke at the meeting. Wang Xin said: The song "Ode to the Motherland" was motivated by the patriotic feelings of the masses. The founding of the People's Republic of China excited me as it did all the people. In 1950, after seeing the Young Pioneers with red scarves enthusiastically preparing for the celebration in Tiananmen Square in the capital, I wanted to express this passionate patriotic feeling in people's hearts. This feeling was also my own feeling, so I wrote the song "Ode to the Motherland." In their speeches, Wang Xin and Sun Zhenhua both thanked the Party for cultivating them into people's music workers.

    Then, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe Chorus, and students from the First Affiliated Elementary School of the Normal University sang nine songs, including the first-prize songs "Singing Mao Zedong," "The Sun Rises on the Grassland," and "Little Dove."

    祝贺群众歌曲获奖者
    首都文艺界举行晚会
    【本报讯】二十三日晚，中央人民政府文化部和中国文学艺术界联合会联合在北京饭店举办晚会，祝贺在三年来全国群众歌曲评奖中获奖的歌曲作者们。参加会议的有首都文化艺术界人士、获奖者及演唱者共三百多人。
    会上，刘芝明、郑振铎、李兆炳、吕骥分别代表中央文化部、中国文学艺术界联合会、军委总政治部文化部和中国音乐家协会向光荣获奖的歌曲作者们致贺。中央文化部副部长刘芝明在讲话中说：从评奖中看出，我国群众歌曲的创作，成绩是显著的。这些歌曲反映了解放以后中国人民的生活、思想、感情，比较突出地反映了中国人民的乐观主义、革命精神和国际主义精神。他鼓励歌曲创作者们继续努力，和文艺团体更密切地合作，创作出更多更好的作品来。
    一等奖歌曲“歌唱祖国”的作者王莘和工人作曲家、三等奖歌曲“为了幸福的明天”作者孙振华，也都在会上讲了话。王莘说：“歌唱祖国”这首歌，是群众爱国主义的情感推动我写的。中华人民共和国的成立，我和所有的人民一样兴奋。一九五零年在首都天安门广场上我看到带红领巾的少年先锋队队员热烈准备庆祝的情况以后，就想把人们心里的这种热烈的爱国主义情感表现出来，这种情感也是我自己的情感，所以我写出了“歌唱祖国”这首歌。王莘和孙振华在讲话中，都感谢党把他们培养成了人民音乐工作者。
    接着，由中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团合唱队、师范大学第一附属小学学生演唱一等奖歌曲“歌唱毛泽东”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”、“小鸽子”等九支歌曲。
