    Mengshan is a large county in Sang Neua Province (Upper Laos), with a population of approximately 10,000. French colonists invaded Mengshan for the second time in 1948. From that time on, the people of Mengshan lived as slaves once again.

    To relieve the suffering of the people, the Lao People's Liberation Army braved dangers and came to Mengshan to organize the people to resist the invaders. Under the encouragement and leadership of the Liberation Army, the first guerrilla force was established, and guerrilla warfare gradually unfolded. The puppet government was overthrown, and the people's government was quickly established.

    After 1951, the people of Mengshan extensively launched a production increase movement, with every household setting targets for increasing rice and coarse grain production. The Liberation Army also actively helped to promote this movement: every soldier planted 150 corn stalks and four square meters of sesame. Thanks to their joint efforts, the economy of the Mengshan guerrilla area was able to become self-sufficient. The Liberation Army also taught the people to read and write, and all the people in the county, young and old, participated in literacy classes. During the day, the peasants worked in the fields or fought the enemy; in the evening, they held meetings or attended night classes. Cadres often lectured people by the light of torches or danced with the children to the rhythm of the sheng and xiao.

    The French colonists, wanting to remove this thorn in their side, launched two months of "mopping-up" operations against the Mengshan guerrilla area in March 1952, barbarically bombing and strafing villages, and burning houses and temples.

    The people of Mengshan County actively carried out counter-mopping-up operations to defend their homes. The Liberation Army and the guerrillas, on the one hand, helped the people evacuate and preserve their property, and on the other hand, dispersed and struck the enemy troops. Young men and women all participated in the armed struggle. Residents of ethnic minorities even used homemade flintlock guns to scatter an entire company of French troops who came to plunder.

    The French invading troops were attacked wherever they went. After suffering heavy losses, they had to withdraw some of their troops to Sang Neua City, leaving only some enemy troops to garrison the nearby Xinpo stronghold. However, these French troops were soon completely wiped out, and the Xinpo stronghold was destroyed. By the beginning of 1953, the Liberation Army was preparing to attack Sang Neua Province, and more than 100 young men and women from Mengshan County volunteered to participate in the rescue work. In the spring of that year, they also followed the army into the liberated city of Sang Neua.

    上寮孟山游击区是怎样建立的
    孟山是上寮（寮国北部）桑怒省的一个大县，约有一万人口。法国殖民者第二次侵入孟山是在一九四八年。从这个时候开始，孟山人民重新过着奴隶生活。
    为解除人民的痛苦，寮国人民解放军冒着艰险来到了孟山，组织人民反抗侵略者。在解放军的鼓舞和领导下，第一支游击队成立了，游击战争逐渐展开；伪政府被推翻了，人民政权很快建立起来。
    到一九五一年以后，孟山人民广泛地展开增产运动，家家都订了增产大米和杂粮的计划。解放军也积极帮助推进这个运动：每一个战士都栽种一百五十株玉蜀黍和四平方公尺的芝麻。由于共同的努力，孟山游击区的经济能够自给自足了。解放军还教人民读书写字，全县的老老少少都参加了识字班。白天，农民在田里干活或打敌人；晚上就举行集会或上夜课。干部们常在火把的亮光下给人们讲课或合着笙、箫的节拍和孩子们跳舞。
    法国殖民者要拔除这根插在背上的芒刺，在一九五二年三月间接连向孟山游击区进行了两个月的“扫荡”，他们野蛮地轰炸、扫射各村庄，焚毁房屋和庙宇。
    孟山县的人民为保卫自己的家乡，积极地进行反扫荡。解放军和游击队一面协助人民疏散和保藏财产，一面化整为零，打击敌军。青年男女都参加了武装斗争。少数民族的居民也曾使用土制的燧发枪击散前来劫掠的一整连法军。
    法国侵略军无论到那里都受到袭击，他们在受重创之后不得不把一部分军队撤到桑怒城，只在附近的新坡据点留下一些敌军据守。然而这些法军不久也被完全歼灭了，新坡据点被拔除。到一九五三年年初，解放军准备进攻桑怒省，孟山县的一百多名青年男女自愿参加了救护工作。这一年春天，他们也随军进入解放了的桑怒城。
