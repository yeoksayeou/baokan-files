Dulles' Distortions and Blackmail
	Wu Quan

Generally, international public opinion believes that Dulles' trip to Western Europe this time has two purposes. On the one hand, it is to force Britain and France to participate in "joint action" and expand the Indochina War; on the other hand, it is to tie the hands of Britain and France to form a so-called "consolidated Western front" to jointly sabotage the Geneva Conference. To achieve this goal, Dulles exerted strong pressure on Britain and France.

Dulles has concluded two days of talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden and issued a joint statement on the talks. The statement actually distorts the facts that everyone knows, insisting that the threat to peace comes from the just struggle of the Indochinese people for national independence and peace, rather than from the United States' open interference in the Indochina War, especially from Washington's shouting and clamoring for an adventurous plan to expand the Indochina War. The statement indicates that the United States and Britain are prepared to study the possibility of establishing a military group similar to the North Atlantic Alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific with other relevant countries, attempting to use this for blackmail. Although the statement expresses the hope that "the Geneva Conference will lead to the restoration of peace in Indochina," the US-British talks themselves and their results are not conducive to the efforts of the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina.

Therefore, when Eden announced the results of the US-British talks in the House of Commons, it immediately aroused fierce questioning. Many Labor Party members accused the British government of succumbing to US pressure, believing that the statement that "the prospect of establishing consistency for defensive purposes throughout Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific will help achieve a glorious peace in Indochina" was an intentional act to undermine the Geneva Conference.

This is not accidental. The powerful movement of the British and Western European people to end the Indochina War and oppose new US adventures in Indochina has been widely and deeply rooted in all social strata, exerting a powerful influence on the public opinion of various countries. When commenting on the talks between Dulles and Eden, the British press fiercely criticized the US's provocative policy, believing that this policy threatens the interests of peace and security of all countries.

The fact is that the United States is forcing Asian countries to expand their armaments and prepare for war, wantonly participating in the Indochina War, and doing everything possible to squeeze France out of Indochina, and using the suspension of so-called US "aid" to force France and Britain to follow the United States in carrying out "joint statements" and "joint actions," attempting to drag them into sabotaging the Geneva Conference and expanding the Indochina War. The United States has established a network of military bases throughout Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, from Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indochina, Thailand, to Pakistan, and is stepping up the formation of military aggression groups. This fully proves the ambition of the United States to dominate Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region, and proves that the United States intends to threaten and undermine the peace and security of Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region.

Just like the military bloc organized by the United States in Western Europe, establishing any military bloc in Asia and the Pacific region can only deepen division and hostility, allowing US adventurers to maintain and create world tensions. World and especially Asian public opinion clearly sees that the peace and security of any region depends on the common obligations of all countries to be guaranteed.

Currently, peace-loving people in various countries are working to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina. The Indochinese people's peaceful will to strive for a ceasefire has been clearly expressed in the repeated statements of President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Indochinese people fought hard and were liberated from the iron heel of Japanese fascism in August 1945. In January 1946, a national election was held, and the unified government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was formally established. This is a well-known historical fact. Today's Indochina War was entirely caused by the colonialists in the French ruling group violating the agreement originally signed between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and France. For many years, the French people have opposed this dirty colonial war, and recently have strongly demanded to end this war through negotiations. Without the obstruction and interference of the United States, the Indochina War could be ended as soon as possible in accordance with the wishes of the people of all countries, especially the people of Indochina and the French people.

It can be seen that the words in the joint statement of the talks between Dulles and Eden, such as the national liberation war of the Indochinese people "threatening" the peace and security of Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region, are completely absurd. Everyone knows that the Indochinese people have been fighting for a long time for the purpose of striving for national independence in order to establish a peaceful and free life on their own land. No one will believe that the struggle of an oppressed nation for freedom and liberation will threaten the peace and security of other countries. In fact, the people of the vast majority of countries in the capitalist world today, including the British and French people, are launching movements aimed at opposing US domination and striving for national independence. It is precisely because of this that Dulles' adventurous plan of "joint action" has received a bad response in Western Europe from the beginning. Despite Dulles' imposition of various pressures, including threatening to suspend "US aid," his ulterior motives cannot deceive people. On the eve of the Geneva Conference, Dulles attempted to poison the international atmosphere with his fabricated lies of "threats" and "dangers" in order to force Britain and France to accept "joint action" and carry out new adventures. This cannot escape the eyes of the people of the world. Under such circumstances, other countries should take an independent attitude and act according to their own interests.

    杜勒斯的歪曲和讹诈
    吴全
    一般国际舆论认为，杜勒斯这次到西欧去，怀抱着两个目的，一方面是要逼迫英法参加“联合行动”，扩大印度支那战争；另一方面则企图绑住英法两国的手脚，结成所谓“巩固的西方阵线”，来共谋破坏日内瓦会议。杜勒斯为了达到这个目的，对英法施行强烈的压力。
    杜勒斯已与英国外交大臣艾登结束了两天的会谈，并发表了会谈的联合声明。声明居然歪曲大家所知道的事实，硬说和平的威胁是来自印度支那人民争取民族独立与和平的正义斗争，而不是来自美国对印度支那战争的公开干涉，特别是来自华盛顿大叫大嚷要扩大印度支那战争的冒险计划。声明表明美国和英国准备与其他有关国家一起研究在东南亚和西太平洋建立一个类似北大西洋联盟的军事集团的可能性，企图借此进行讹诈。虽然声明表示希望“日内瓦会议将导致恢复印度支那的和平”，但是，美英会谈的本身及其结果，都并不是为了促进日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的努力。
    因此，当艾登在下院宣布美英会谈的结果时，立即引起了激烈的质询。许多工党议员指责英国政府屈服于美国的压力，认为声明所谓“在整个东南亚与西太平洋建立防御目的的一致性的前景将有助于在印度支那实现光荣的和平”，是有意破坏日内瓦会议的行为。
    这不是偶然的。英国和西欧人民普遍要求结束印度支那战争，反对美国在印度支那进行新的冒险的强大运动，已广泛地深入到了各社会阶层，对各国舆论发生了有力的影响。英国报刊在评论杜勒斯和艾登的会谈时，就激烈地批评了美国的挑衅政策，认为这个政策威胁到各国和平与安全的利益。
    事实正是如此，美国强使亚洲国家扩军备战，横蛮参加印度支那战争，多方设法要把法国挤出印度支那，并以停止所谓美“援”来逼迫法国和英国等跟随美国搞什么“联合声明”、“联合行动”，企图拖着他们破坏日内瓦会议，扩大印度支那战争。美国在整个东南亚及西太平洋地区，从日本、冲绳岛、台湾、菲律宾、印度支那、泰国，直到巴基斯坦，建立了星罗棋布的军事基地网，并加紧拼凑军事侵略集团。这完全证明了美国企图称霸东南亚及西太平洋地区的野心，证明美国居心威胁并破坏东南亚和西太平洋地区的和平与安全。
    正像美国在西欧所组织的军事集团那样，在亚洲和太平洋地区建立任何的军事集团，都只能加深分裂与敌对，使美国冒险家得以保持和制造世界的紧张局势。全世界特别是亚洲的公众舆论看得很清楚，任何地区的和平与安全，都有赖于所有国家共同承担义务，才能得到保证。
    目前各国爱好和平的人民正致力于在印度支那实现停战。印度支那人民争取停战的和平意志，在越南民主共和国胡志明主席的多次声明中已经表示得非常清楚。印度支那人民在胡志明主席领导艰苦奋斗，于一九四五年八月从日本法西斯的铁蹄下解放出来。并于一九四六年一月举行了全国的选举，正式成立了统一的越南民主共和国政府，这是人所共知的历史事实。今天的印度支那战争完全是由法国统治集团中的殖民主义者违背当初的越南民主共和国和法国订立的协定而引起的。法国人民多年来就反对这场肮脏的殖民战争，最近更强烈地要求通过谈判来结束这场战争。如果没有美国的阻挠和干涉的话，印度支那战争是可以按照各国人民特别是印度支那人民和法国人民的愿望早日结束的。
    由此可见，杜勒斯和艾登的会谈的联合声明中所说的印度支那人民的民族解放战争“威胁”了东南亚及西太平洋地区的和平与安全等语，完全是荒诞无稽之谈。谁都知道，印度支那人民进行了长期的斗争，其目的就是为了争取民族独立，以便在自己的土地上建立和平与自由的生活。没有人会相信，一个被压迫民族争取自由解放的斗争竟会威胁他国的和平与安全。事实上，在今天资本主义世界的绝大多数国家的人民，包括英法人民在内，都正在展开旨在反对美国支配、争取民族独立的运动。正是因为这样，杜勒斯提出“联合行动”的冒险计划，一开始就在西欧得到不好的反应。尽管杜勒斯施行了各种压力，包括以停止“美援”作要挟在内，但是，它的别有用心的计谋是骗不了人的。杜勒斯在日内瓦会议前夕，企图用他自己所编造的什么“威胁”“危险”的谎言，来毒化国际气氛，借以逼迫英法接受“联合行动”，进行新的冒险，已不可能逃避世界人民的目光。在这种情形下，别的国家应该是根据自己的利益来采取独立的态度行事。
