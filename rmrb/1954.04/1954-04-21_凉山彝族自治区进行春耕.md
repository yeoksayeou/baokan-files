Make a good job of spring ploughing and sowing to ensure increased agricultural production

    Spring Ploughing in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region
    Spring ploughing is underway in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, Xikang Province. Yi farmers in various locations are currently sowing buckwheat, while some farmers are busy repairing paddy fields. The main grain crop planted in March, potatoes, has already sprouted to be more than an inch high, and rice in the plains has also sprouted.
    Before spring ploughing, the Autonomous Region People's Government organized production work teams to go to Zhaojue, Xide, Puge and other counties to guide and assist Yi farmers in production. The People's Governments of various counties in the Autonomous Region have also studied the work of leading spring ploughing production. In order to help farmers of all ethnic groups overcome the difficulties of farm tools, rations, and seeds, the Autonomous Region People's Government, in addition to distributing more than 220,000 pieces of free iron farm tools last December, has recently allocated approximately 800,000 catties of relief grain. In addition, special personnel were sent to the Jinsha River area in Yunnan to purchase seeds for poor farmers. In many areas, after receiving free farm tools, Yi farmers actively repaired embankments and processed the land, turning dry land into paddy fields. According to statistics from Zhaojue, Xide, Puge, and Jinyang counties, the repaired and newly built water embankments can irrigate more than 25,000 mu of land.

    凉山彝族自治区进行春耕
    西康省凉山彝族自治区正在进行春耕生产。目前各地彝族农民正在播种荞麦，部分农民忙着整修水田。三月间播种的主要粮食作物马铃薯，已经出土一寸多高，平坝地区的水稻也已出芽。
    春耕前，自治区人民政府组织了生产工作队分别到昭觉、喜德、普格等县指导和帮助彝族农民生产，自治区各县人民政府也都研究了领导春耕生产的工作。为帮助各族农民克服农具、口粮和籽种的困难，自治区人民政府除在去年十二月发放了二十二万多件无偿铁质农具，最近还拨发了约八十万斤救济粮。此外，还派专人到云南境内金沙江一带给贫苦农民购买种籽。许多地区的彝族农民，在得到无偿农具后，积极修埝，进行土地加工，把旱地改成水田。据昭觉、喜德、普格、金阳等四个县的统计，已整修和新修的水埝可灌地二万五千多亩。
