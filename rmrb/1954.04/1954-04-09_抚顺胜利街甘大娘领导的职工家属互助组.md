The Twenty-second Residents' Group of Shengli Street, Shengli District, Fushun City, consists of fifty households, all of whom are workers' families. Forty-two of these households are families of power plant workers, with sixty-three women and sixty-two children. This group was established in 1950. The group leader, Gan Da Niang, is a housewife in her forties or fifties and a representative of the district's First People's Congress. At the First People's Congress, she vividly introduced her experience in organizing mutual aid among workers' families, describing the achievements made over the years in launching mass mutual aid to solve the immediate problems of workers' families and encourage workers' enthusiasm for production, ensure the improvement of workers' attendance rates, and assist workers in completing and overfulfilling national plans. The congress finally passed a resolution to promote Gan Da Niang's experience in organizing mutual aid groups throughout the district.

The family mutual aid work of the Twenty-second Residents' Group was gradually developed under the leadership of the power plant's Party committee and trade union. Before the organization of family mutual aid in 1950, the absence of power plant workers due to family affairs was quite common. In general, the desire of family members to study culture and participate in social activities was also greatly limited. Therefore, organizing family mutual aid naturally became an inevitable path to solving these problems. However, when the organization of family mutual aid began, many difficulties were encountered due to the extremely inconsistent understanding among people. First of all, many people were unwilling to participate. For example, young worker's family member Wang Guihua had the idea of "never asking anyone for anything," thinking that she was nimble and did not need help from others, and that joining the mutual aid group would only be troublesome. Later, when she gave birth, Gan Da Niang organized family members to help her call a doctor and cook, and explained the purpose of mutual aid to her. After Gan Da Niang's education and personal experience, Wang Guihua changed her previous ideas. She not only joined the mutual aid group, but also often said: "Joining the mutual aid group is really convenient; who can be without big or small things!" The worker Li Lianzhong initially disagreed with his wife joining the mutual aid group. Later, when his wife went back to her parents' home to visit relatives, the mutual aid group helped him take care of the children and cook, and he was very touched. After his wife returned, he actively encouraged her to do a good job in mutual aid.

Although the mutual aid group was organized, many abnormal phenomena still existed due to the lack of necessary systems and the insufficient understanding of the nature of the mutual aid group, which hindered the consolidation and development of the mutual aid group. At the beginning, the mutual aid group did not know how to mobilize and organize the masses. Therefore, when something happened, only a few cadres and activists ran around. Worker's family member Liu Liu had no children and less work, so she often helped others; Li Li had many children and a lot of work, and thought that "mutual aid means those with less work help those with more work." Although she often received help from others, she was dissatisfied if she did not receive help immediately. Some also only proceeded from personal feelings. For example, Zhang Da Niang and Chen Da Niang were from the same hometown, and although they lived far apart, they could often help each other, but they did not care much about those with whom they had less emotional connection. Song Zhao, who lived next door to Chen Da Niang, said: "This kind of mutual aid is really not fun. Last time I was sick, Chen Da Niang didn't care, so tomorrow I won't help her either." After Gan Da Niang discovered these situations, she analyzed and researched them with the cadres in the group, realizing that no matter what kind of work, it is necessary for cadres to take the lead, but it is more important to mobilize and rely on the masses. This requires strengthening ideological education for the masses and establishing necessary organizational systems. Therefore, through deliberation, discussion, and explanation at meetings, Gan Da Niang explained to everyone that mutual aid is everyone's business. On the one hand, it is necessary to promote the spirit of class friendship and take care of families in difficulty in order to ensure that workers do not miss work due to family affairs and to cooperate with factory production for the benefit of the country. On the other hand, it is also necessary to be as fair and reasonable as possible based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. Everyone decided that in future work, the mutual aid group leader would be responsible for appropriate division of labor and make mutual aid records, check them once a week, and solve problems immediately when they were discovered. As a result, everyone further recognized the purpose and principles of mutual aid. Chen Da Niang and Zhang Da Niang also had great changes. The mutual aid work gradually got on the right track.

After the mutual aid group was organized, the question of how much it could play a role became a matter of unanimous concern. The facts answered this question. First, the problem of workers' families not being able to participate in cultural learning and social activities due to family affairs and children was solved. At first, they tried to take time out every day to study, but they were still hindered by family affairs and found it difficult to persevere. After the mutual aid group was consolidated, the learning time was changed to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Except for some problems that had to be solved on the same day, people were drawn to solve them, and general housework was done on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, women and children gathered in two courtyards. The children learned to sing, or adults educated them not to hit people, not to make noise, and to pay attention to hygiene; women studied culture, listened to the radio, or read newspapers. In the past, it was very inconvenient for women to go out to do some errands or visit relatives. Now, the children can be handed over to the temporary nursery, and someone can cook meals at home, so they can rest assured. Second, it guaranteed the attendance rate of workers. For example, when the wife of worker Wu Xuesi was about to give birth, the mutual aid group sent people to take care of her before and after delivery, and they were very concerned. On the day of delivery, some people invited doctors, some people cooked eggs, and they took good care of her. Wu Xuesi not only did not miss work, but also his wife and children received good care. After the wife of worker Qin Yuzhang died, he took care of four children, cooked by himself, could not participate in learning, and could not attend meetings at night, so he could not concentrate on production. After the family mutual aid group was established, everyone took turns to be responsible and solved his difficulties. Later, Qin Yuzhang found a knack for production in the production increase and economy movement, creating wealth worth 430 tons of grain for the country, and was also named a municipal labor model. After the family members were organized, they not only did a good job in everyone's housework, so that the workers could eat well, sleep well, and rest well, ensuring that they could concentrate on production, but also stipulated a system for checking the attendance of workers. After 1952, the workers in this group basically maintained a 100% attendance rate. Third, it improved the socialist consciousness of family members and cultivated collectivist ideas. Now, almost every group member realizes that their work is of great significance for promoting production and promoting the country's socialist industrialization. "Everything for the production of factories and mines, for building a better country" has become the creed of everyone's daily work and life. In order to promote the spirit of class friendship, they not only carry out mutual aid among family members, but also help single workers cook and wash clothes. During the Spring Festival, the mutual aid group made many dumplings for the workers in the single dormitory and washed one hundred and six quilts.

After being organized for a considerable period of time, they still did not know how to contact and obtain assistance from all parties. When something happened, they just revolved around the family circle. At that time, although they did a good job in housework, they still could not help with the factory's production. For example, worker Lu Fanbin's wife did not know how to manage the family, and the couple was not in harmony. The mutual aid group helped his wife to change, but Lu Fanbin still "held grudges" against his wife, did not like to get up in the morning, slept during working hours, and often violated labor discipline. The chairman of the factory trade union asked him why he was sleeping during working hours, and he lied and said, "I take care of the children and do housework at home, so I am sleepy when I go to work." Later, the trade union contacted the mutual aid group and jointly educated and helped him, and Lu Fanbin made great progress. The family members learned from this incident that if they encounter problems that cannot be solved, they should study solutions with the trade union and pay attention to seeking assistance from all parties. Last year, they began to organize regular joint meetings of workers and family members in order to understand each other's situations and requirements and exchange opinions. Therefore, they not only constantly overcame the shortcomings in their work and made the family work more closely coordinated with the production of factories and mines, but also naturally carried out criticism and praise at the meetings, which greatly encouraged the production and work enthusiasm of workers and family members. Especially after the First People's Congress, due to the further emphasis on this work by the Party and government leading organs and the strengthening of unified leadership over family mutual aid work, the work of the mutual aid group became more organized and planned. For example, before the Spring Festival, under the leadership of the People's Government, the Party organization of factories and mines, and the trade union, a joint meeting of workers and family members was held in advance, and workers and family members put forward their requirements and guarantees to each other. The family members guaranteed not to take workers to visit relatives casually during the Spring Festival, to do a good job in sanitation, not to let workers drink alcohol before work, and to make dumplings and wash quilts for single workers; the workers guaranteed not to be absent from work, to do a good job in the factory's safety and security work, to inform family members or the mutual aid group when visiting or going out, to concentrate on production when working, and not to cause accidents. On the fourth day of the first lunar month, except for Zhang Jingchun, who was absent due to his wife's mental illness relapse, all the other workers happily went to the factory to produce.

    抚顺胜利街甘大娘领导的职工家属互助组
    一
    抚顺市胜利区胜利街二十二居民组现有五十户，都是职工家属，其中四十二户是发电厂职工家属，有六十三名妇女，六十二名儿童。这个组是从一九五○年建立起来的，组长甘大娘是一位四五十岁的家庭妇女，该区第一次人民代表大会的代表。她在第一次人民代表大会上生动地介绍了组织职工家属互助的经验，介绍了几年来开展群众性的互助在解决职工家属的切身问题和鼓励职工生产热情、保证提高职工出勤率、协助职工完成和超额完成国家计划等方面所取得的成绩。大会最后通过决议，把甘大娘组织互助组的经验在全区加以推广。
    二
    二十二居民组的家属互助工作是在发电厂的党委和工会领导下逐渐开展起来的。一九五○年未组织家属互助以前，发电厂职工由于家庭事务的牵累，缺勤现象相当普遍。一般家属学习文化和参加社会活动的要求，也受到很大的限制。因此，组织家属互助就自然形成解决这些问题的必经道路。然而，开始组织家属互助时，由于大家的认识极不一致，工作中遇到很多困难。首先是许多人不愿意参加。如青年工属王桂花有着“万事不求人”的想法，以为自己俐手俐脚，不需要别人帮助，参加互助组反而是找麻烦。后来甘大娘就在她生孩子的时候，组织家属帮助她请医生，做饭，并给她讲解互助的目的。王桂花经过甘大娘的教育和切身的体会，改变了以前的想法。她不仅加入了互助组，还常说：“参加了互助组可真方便了，谁还能没个大小事情！”工人李连仲最初也不同意他的老婆参加互助组，后来他的老婆回娘家看亲，互助组就帮他看孩子、做饭，他很受感动。他的老婆回来后，他便积极鼓励她做好互助工作。
    互助组虽然组织起来了，但由于缺乏必要的制度，大家对互助组的性质也了解得不够清楚，因而还存在着许多不正常的现象，妨碍互助组的巩固和发展。互助组开始不懂得怎样发动和组织群众，因而有了事，只是几个干部和积极分子东跑西跑。工属刘柳氏没有小孩，自己活少，经常帮助别人；李李氏孩子多，活多，认为“互助就是活少的帮助活多的”，虽然经常得到别人帮助，但一时得不到帮助就不满意。也有的只从私人感情出发，如张大娘和陈大娘两人是同乡，虽然相隔较远，也能经常互助，但对感情较为疏远的就不怎么关心。陈大娘隔壁的宋赵氏就说：“这样互助真不带劲，咱上次有病，陈大娘也不管，明儿个咱也不帮助她了。”甘大娘发现这些情况后，就和组里的干部作了分析研究，认识到不管在什么工作中，干部带头是必要的，但更重要的是发动群众和依靠群众。这就要对群众加强思想教育，并建立必要的组织制度。于是，通过酝酿讨论和开会讲解，甘大娘向大家说明了互助是大家的事，一方面要发扬阶级友爱精神，为了国家的利益，应从保证职工不因家事缺勤和配合工厂生产出发，照顾困难户；一方面也要根据自愿互利的原则，尽量做到公平合理。大家决定以后的工作，由互助组长负责适当分工，并作互助记录，每周检查一次，发现问题立即解决。这一来，大家都进一步认清了互助的目的和原则。陈大娘和张大娘也有了很大的转变。互助工作逐步纳入正轨。
    三
    互助组组织起来以后，究竟能起多大的作用，成了大家一致关心的问题。事实解答了这一疑问。第一是职工家属因家事和孩子扯腿不能参加文化学习和社会活动的问题解决了。她们最初曾采取每天抽时间学习的办法，但仍然受到家事的拖累，很难坚持。互助组巩固后，改为每星期一、三、五为学习时间。除了一些必须当日解决的问题抽人加以解决外，一般的家务放到星期二、四、六去搞。在星期一、三、五这几天里，妇女和孩子们分别在两个院子集中，孩子们学唱歌，或由大人教育他们不打人、不吵闹以及讲究卫生等；妇女们学习文化，收听广播或读报。过去，妇女们外出办一些事情或串亲戚，很不方便，现在孩子可以交给临时托儿所，家里的饭也有人代做，就很放心了。第二，保证了职工的出勤率。如工人吴学思的老婆要生孩子，临产前后，互助组即派人照顾，非常关心。生产的那天，有的给请医生，有的给煮鸡蛋，照顾得很周到。吴学思不仅没有缺勤，而且孩子大人都得到很好的照顾。工人秦玉章老婆死了以后，他带着四个孩子，自己做饭，不能参加学习，晚上也不能开会，生产也不安心。成立了家属互助组后，大家轮流负责，解决了他的困难。后来秦玉章在增产节约运动中，找到生产窍门，为国家创造了价值四百三十吨粮食的财富，还被评为市级劳动模范。家属们组织起来以后，不仅搞好了大家的家务，使职工吃好、睡好、休息好，保证他们安心生产，而且还规定了检查职工出勤情况的制度。一九五二年以后，该组职工基本上保持了百分之百的出勤率。第三，提高了家属的社会主义觉悟，培养了集体主义的思想。现在每一个组员差不多都认识到自己的工作对推动生产，促进国家社会主义工业化有很大意义。“一切为了厂矿生产，为了建设好国家”，已成为大家日常工作和生活的信条。为了发扬阶级友爱的精神，她们不仅在家属间进行互助，而且还帮助单身工人做饭、洗衣服等。春节期间，互助组给独身宿舍工人包了许多饺子，拆洗了一百零六床被子。
   四
    在组织起来以后一个相当长的时期，她们还不懂得与各方面联系和取得协助，有事只是在家属圈子里打转，那时，她们虽然把家务做得很好，但对厂里的生产还是使不上劲。如工人陆樊滨因为老婆不会过日子，夫妇不和。互助组帮助他的老婆转变了，可是陆樊滨还和老婆“呕气”，早晨不爱起来，工作时间睡觉，经常违犯劳动纪律。工厂工会主席问他为什么工作时间睡觉，他撒谎说：“在家带孩子、做活，上班就困。”后来工会和互助组取得联系，共同教育他，帮助他，陆樊滨有了很大的进步。家属们从这件事情中得出经验，以后遇到解决不了的问题，就和工会研究解决办法，并注意争取各方面的协助。去年她们开始组织了定期的工人和家属联席会，以便互相了解情况和要求，交换意见，因而不仅不断地克服了工作中的缺点，使家属工作与厂矿生产更加密切配合，而且在会上很自然地开展了批评和表扬，大大鼓舞了工人和家属的生产、工作积极性。特别在第一次人民代表大会以后，由于党、政领导机关进一步重视了这一工作，加强了家属互助工作的统一领导，互助组的工作就更加有组织有计划了。如春节前，在人民政府、厂矿党组织和工会的领导下，提前召开了工人、家属联席会，职工和家属互相提出了要求和保证条件。家属保证春节期间不随便带职工走亲戚，搞好卫生工作，不让职工在上班前喝酒，并给独身职工包饺子、洗被子；职工保证不缺勤，做好厂里安全保卫工作，串门外出时要告知家属或互助组，上班时安心生产，不出事故。正月初四那天，全组除张景春由于老婆精神病复发而缺勤外，其余职工全都愉快地进厂生产了。
