The CCP Central Committee Inner Mongolia Bureau Holds Enlarged Meeting
Conscientiously Reviewing Work Based on the Fourth Plenary Session Resolution

[By Our Own Correspondent] The Inner Mongolia Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from March 10th to 27th to convey and discuss the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. In addition to all members of the Branch Bureau, the participants included the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Eastern District Party Committee, various local Party Committees, Municipal Party Committees, League Committees, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, cadres above the division level of the Inner Mongolia Military Region and the Public Security Forces, and leading Party member cadres in Party, government, and mass organizations at the Inner Mongolia level, totaling sixty-six people.

After hearing the report by Comrade Ulanhu, Secretary of the Branch Bureau, on the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and the report by Comrade Su Qianyi, Deputy Secretary of the Branch Bureau, on the Enlarged Meeting of the North China Bureau, the meeting conducted a serious discussion. All comrades present unanimously supported Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the Fourth Plenary Session and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Plenary Session, expressing their determination to fight for the implementation of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolutions. Based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and in light of the actual situation of Party organizations at all levels in the Inner Mongolia region, the meeting conducted a review and discussion in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The meeting clearly pointed out that Inner Mongolia is a multi-ethnic region, especially since the merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia is recent, and there is a greater need to pay attention to unity; we must be sufficiently vigilant and prevent the harm of bourgeois nationalism of all colors to our ethnic unity. The meeting also pointed out that the Inner Mongolia region is vast, dispersed, and located on the border of the motherland, which often makes it easy to consciously or unconsciously emphasize the special, and it is easy to produce errors of departmentalism, localism, and decentralism when specifically implementing the central government's guidelines and policies due to emphasizing the special. Therefore, leading cadres in various places must pay close attention to correctly implementing the central government's guidelines and policies in accordance with local conditions under the major premise of strengthening unified and centralized leadership. The meeting also reviewed the past insufficient understanding of the importance of Party unity, low sensitivity, failure to fully exert the role of the Party's collective leadership, and insufficient development of democratic life within the Party and criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, and put forward suggestions for improvement in the future. The meeting emphasized that the Central Committee's resolution on strengthening Party unity must be implemented in Party organizations at all levels throughout the region, and every Party member must use it to examine their words and deeds, and responsible cadres must become models for implementing this resolution.

The meeting requested that Party committees at all levels organize the conveyance and study of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution and report among Party members and cadres, especially Party committees above the level of the prefectural, league, and municipal committees must first study well and conduct inspections in connection with the leadership of the Party committees. Through careful study and inspection, they should overcome and eliminate all phenomena that are not conducive to unity, so that the Central Committee's resolution on strengthening Party unity can be implemented in all aspects of the Inner Mongolia region.

    中共中央内蒙古分局举行扩大会议
    根据四中全会决议认真检查工作
    【本报讯】中共中央内蒙古分局在三月十日到二十七日举行了扩大会议，传达并讨论了七届四中全会决议。参加会议的除分局全体委员外，有东部区党委和各地委、市委、盟委正副书记，铁道部第三工程局党委书记，内蒙古军区、公安部队师以上的干部及内蒙古一级的党、政、群众团体中党员负责干部，共六十六人。
    会议听了分局书记乌兰夫同志关于七届四中全会的传达报告和分局副书记苏谦益同志关于华北局扩大会议的传达报告后，进行了严肃的讨论。全体到会同志一致拥护刘少奇同志在四中全会上的报告和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，表示坚决为实现四中全会的决议而斗争。会议并根据四中全会的精神，联系内蒙古地区各级党的实际情况，以批评与自我批评的精神进行了检查和讨论。会议明确指出：内蒙古，是一个多民族地区，特别是绥远与内蒙古合并不久，有更加注意团结的必要；对各色资产阶级民族主义思想对我们民族团结的危害，必须有足够的警惕和防止。会议并指出：内蒙古地区辽阔、分散，处于祖国边陲，往往容易自觉或不自觉地强调特殊，容易在具体贯彻中央的方针和政策时，因为强调特殊，而产生本位主义、地方主义、分散主义的错误。所以各地领导干部必须十分注意在加强统一集中领导的大前提下，因地制宜地正确地贯彻中央的方针和政策。会议也检讨了过去对党的团结的重要性认识不足，嗅觉不高，党的集体领导的作用未能充分发挥，党内民主生活及批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评开展得不够充分等，并提出了今后改进的意见。会议强调指出：中央关于增强党的团结的决议必须在全区各级党组织中贯彻执行，每个党员都必须据此来检查自己的一言一行，负责干部更须成为贯彻这个决议的模范。
    会议要求各级党委对四中全会决议及报告，在党员干部中组织传达和学习，特别是地、盟、市委以上的党委必须首先学好，联系党委的领导进行检查，通过认真的学习和检查，克服并消除一切不利于团结的现象，使中央关于增强党的团结的决议在内蒙古地区各个方面求得贯彻实现。
