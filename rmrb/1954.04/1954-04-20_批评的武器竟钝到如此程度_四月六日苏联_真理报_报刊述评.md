The Weapon of Criticism is So Dull
—Commentary on the Soviet "Pravda" Newspaper on April 6th

Veterinary doctor Pavlov from the Urnar district sent a letter to the editorial department of the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper. This rural correspondent reported the poor management of the Krupskaya collective farm. In the fifth work team of this collective farm, the sheep pen has not been completed after two years of construction, and the sheep are all in the open air. In another livestock farm, the rabbits are also gradually dying.

The rural correspondent originally wanted to let the broad public opinion and the readers of the newspaper know about this negligent attitude towards collective farm property, but he did not receive the necessary support from the editorial department. Comrade Gimofeyev, the head of the agricultural group, kept the letter in his desk for nearly a month and a half, and then wrote a bureaucratic and indifferent reply to the author: "Your communication 'Neglected Corner' cannot be used due to the crowded layout of the newspaper."

If the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper really had no space to publish this letter of about fifty lines from the rural correspondent, then the editorial department had other ways to influence the careless leaders of the collective farm. It could write a letter to the Party organization and the Soviet organization, and to the inspection organs, asking them to investigate the situation of the collective farm on the spot and hold people accountable. However, no one in the editorial department cared about this matter. The letter was buried in the archives.

The letter from technician Tsiganov also suffered the same fate. His letter talked about the chaos in the construction of the Republic's collective farm hydropower station. Four months later, the editorial department told the author that his letter could not be used "due to the harvest campaign."

Many articles and letters from worker-peasant correspondents were archived by the editorial department. Among them were questions about serious violations of the articles of association of agricultural labor cooperatives in collective farms, waste of socialist property, and shortcomings in the cultural and living supply of workers.

This non-Party attitude towards letters from worker-peasant correspondents is essentially suppressing criticism from below and stifling the initiative of workers.

The "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper has forgotten that the strength of our newspapers lies in its broad connection with the masses. This can be proved by the fact that the number of letters received and published by the editorial department is not gradually increasing, but gradually decreasing. The number of letters received by the editorial department in 1953 decreased by 1,709 compared with 1952, while the number of letters published in the newspaper decreased by almost half.

All this makes the newspaper weak and unable to perform its tasks well.

The "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper has not done a satisfactory job in the struggle to further improve agriculture. The editorial department did not widely attract experts, mechanics from machine tractor stations, and advanced agricultural and animal husbandry workers to participate in the newspaper's work. After the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, only two small articles appeared in the newspaper about the working experience of ordinary collective farmers. The "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper rarely publishes articles by collective farm chairmen, agronomists, breeders, livestock farm managers, and work team leaders.

The bureaucratic attitude and formalism in the work of the editorial department has alienated the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper from the collective farmers, workers and experts of the machine tractor stations, making it unsatisfactory in clarifying the socialist competition of the Republic's workers to realize the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, to strive for high yields of grain, industrial crops, potatoes and vegetables, to expand the number of livestock and increase their product productivity, and to adopt scientific achievements and innovators' experiences.

The readers of the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper have long discovered that the criticism in the newspaper is usually only aimed at lower-level staff. It is difficult to find a sharp article in the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper criticizing the organizations and their leaders at the republic level. This style, which runs counter to the tradition of our newspapers, was established by Editor-in-Chief Kartashov. He is unwilling to spoil his relationship with leading cadres, and often does not publish critical articles under various pretexts, but sends these articles to the relevant authorities. This is a very successful method: he cannot be blamed for suppressing criticism, and no one will blame the editor-in-chief.

The editorial department received a sharp communication exposing the leaders of the Chuvash Handicraft Cooperative for a long-term disregard of the "Red Warrior" cooperative's behavior of raising the price of woven products, which violated national interests. It seemed that the editor-in-chief should respond enthusiastically, check these facts and publish this communication, and at the same time give a sharp and principled criticism to the staff who harmed the interests of consumers. But it wasn't like that. This communication was secretly sent to the inspection agency that already knew these facts.

This mistake has been pointed out to the editor-in-chief. But, obviously, he still sticks to his own opinion. On March 21, the newspaper published an article entitled "Change the Working Style and Working Methods of the Chuvash Handicraft Cooperative Council." In such an article, which is almost a full page long, there is not even the slightest mention of the behavior of the Republic's handicraft cooperative system that violates national interests. At the same time, the editorial department has already learned some new situations about the "Shvenik" cooperative raising the price of goods.

In an article entitled "Strive for High Quality of Daily Necessities!", it was pointed out that the quality of products of many enterprises is poor. However, this article did not point out the names of any staff in the Republic's local industry and fuel industry department who condoned the manufacture of defective products.

The editorial department's avoidance of shortcomings and failure to criticize specific individuals who made mistakes has resulted in fostering a mood of indifference and complacency among industrial staff.

A year ago, the plenary session of the Chuvash Party's State Committee discussed the work of the editorial departments of the Republic's newspapers and passed a resolution. The resolution said:

"The plenary session believes that the Standing Committee of the State Committee has not taken sufficient measures to launch criticism and self-criticism from below in the newspapers. The newspapers are afraid to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of individual organizations, especially the organizations at the Republic level and their leaders."

However, there has been no actual change so far. The leadership of the Chuvash Party's State Committee over the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper is still not satisfactory, failing to make good use of the newspaper to fight against the unattended phenomena in the Republic's agriculture, and tolerating the indifferent attitude towards letters from worker-peasant correspondents and the lack of sharp and principled criticism on the newspaper.

×××

After discussing the work of the "Soviet Chuvash" newspaper, the Central Committee of the CPSU instructed the Standing Committee of the Chuvash Party's State Committee to pay attention to the unsatisfactory situation of the leadership of the newspaper, and instructed it to take measures to ensure the improvement of the work of the editorial department, to launch realistic and principled criticism in the newspaper, so that the shortcomings of the Republic's Party, Soviet and economic organizations in leading industry and agriculture can be eliminated.

    批评的武器竟钝到如此程度
    ——四月六日苏联“真理报”报刊述评
    乌尔纳尔区兽医医士巴伏洛夫向“苏维埃楚瓦什”报编辑部寄去了一封信。这位农村通讯员报道了克鲁普斯卡娅集体农庄管理不善的现象。这个集体农庄的第五工作队，羊栏已经建造了两年尚未建成，羊都在露天里，另外一个牧畜场中的家兔也在逐渐死亡。
    这位农村通讯员原想使广大舆论界、使报纸的读者知道这种对待集体农庄财产的疏忽态度，但是他没有得到编辑部必要的支持。农业组组长吉莫菲耶夫同志把这封信在办公桌里放了几达一个半月之久，然后给作者写了一封官僚主义的冷淡的复信：“你的通讯‘无人过问的角落’，由于报纸版面拥挤不能采用。”
    如果“苏维埃楚瓦什”报真是没有地位刊登农村通讯员这封长约五十行的信件，那么编辑部也有其他办法来影响集体农庄不经心的领导者们。它可以写一封信给党组织和苏维埃组织，给检查机关，要求他们就地研究一下集体农庄的情况并追究责任。但是，编辑部里没有一个人关心这件事。信被埋葬在档案之中。
    技师齐加诺夫同志的信，也遭到了同样的命运。他信中所谈的是共和国集体农庄水电站建筑中的紊乱情况。四个月后，编辑部告诉作者说，他的信“由于收获运动”而未能用出。
    有不少工农通讯员的短文和信件，都被编辑部存了档。其中有关于集体农庄中严重破坏农业劳动组合章程的问题，有浪费社会主义财产和对劳动者文化和生活供应方面的缺点问题。
    对待工农通讯员信件的这种非党的态度，实质上就是压制来自下面的批评，扼杀劳动者的主动精神。
    “苏维埃楚瓦什”报已经忘掉，我们报刊的力量就在于它与群众的广泛联系。这可由以下情况来证明：编辑部所收到的信件和刊登的信件数目，不是逐渐增长，而是逐渐减缩。编辑部一九五三年所收到的信件与一九五二年相比，减少了一千七百零九封，而报纸上刊载的信则几乎减了一半。
    这一切情况使报纸变得软弱无力，使它不能很好地执行它面前的任务。
    “苏维埃楚瓦什”报在为进一步提高农业而斗争方面，做得不能令人满意。编辑部没有广泛吸引专家、机器拖拉机站的机械师、农业和饲畜业的先进者来参加报纸工作。在苏共中央九月全会之后，报纸上只出现了两小篇普通集体农民关于他们的工作经验的文章。“苏维埃楚瓦什”报很少刊载集体农庄主席、农艺学家、饲养家、畜牧场场长和工作队长的文章。
    编辑部工作中的官僚态度和形式主义，使“苏维埃楚瓦什”报脱离了集体农民、机器拖拉机站的工人和专家，使它在阐明共和国劳动者争取实现苏共中央九月全会决议，争取得到谷物、技术作物、马铃薯和蔬菜的高额收获量，争取扩大牲畜头数并提高其产品生产率，争取采用科学成就和革新者经验的社会主义竞赛方面，也不能令人满意。
    “苏维埃楚瓦什”报的读者早已发觉报纸上的批评通常只是针对低层工作人员。在“苏维埃楚瓦什”报上很难找到一篇尖锐的批评共和国一级的组织及其领导人的文章。这种与我们报刊的传统背道而驰的作风，是总编辑卡尔塔晓夫同志建立起来的。他不愿和领导工作者搞坏关系，时常在各种借口下不发表批评文章，而把这些文章分送至各有关机关。这是一个很成功的办法：既不能责备他压制批评，也不会有人见怪总编辑。
    编辑部曾接到揭发楚瓦什工艺合作社领导人的一则尖锐的通讯。指出这些领导人长时期漠视“红色战士”合作社工作人员提高织品价格的违反国家利益的行为。看起来，总编辑应该热烈响应，检查这些事实并发表这篇通讯，同时给损害消费者利益的工作人员以尖锐的原则性的批评。但是，并不是这样。这篇通讯被秘密送往早已知道这些事实的检查机关去了。
    这个错误曾向总编辑指明过。但是，显然他仍然固执己见。三月二十一日报纸刊登了“改变楚瓦什工艺合作社理事会的工作作风和工作方法”的论文。在这样一篇几乎长达一版的文章中，甚至丝毫未提及共和国工艺合作社系统中违反国家利益的行为。同时，编辑部已经又知道了“什维尼克”合作社抬高商品价格的一些新情况。
    在一篇以“争取日用品的高等质量！”为题的论文中，曾指出许多企业的产品质量低劣。然而在这篇文章中却未指出共和国地方工业和燃料工业部中姑息制造废品的任何一个工作人员的姓名。
    编辑部对缺点避而不谈，对犯错误的具体人物不批评，结果在工业工作人员之间培植起满不在乎和自安自慰的情绪。
    一年以前，楚瓦什党的州委会全会讨论了共和国各报纸编辑部的工作并通过决议。决议中说：
    “全会认为，州委会常委会没有采取充分措施来在报纸上展开来自下面的批评和自我批评。各报在批评个别组织，特别是共和国一级的组织及其领导人的缺点和错误时，是畏首畏尾的。”
    但是，到目前为止并没有任何实际的改变。楚瓦什党的州委会对“苏维埃楚瓦什”报的领导仍然不能令人满意，未能好好利用该报与共和国农业方面的无人照管现象做斗争，并容忍对待工农通讯员信件的冷淡态度和报面上缺乏尖锐的原则性的批评的现象。
                ×××
    苏共中央在讨论了“苏维埃楚瓦什”报的工作问题之后，指示楚瓦什党的州委会常委会注意对报纸的领导不能令人满意的情况，并责成它采取措施，保证改进编辑部的工作，在报纸上展开实事求是的和原则性的批评，以使共和国党、苏维埃和经济组织在领导工业和农业方面的缺点得以消除。
