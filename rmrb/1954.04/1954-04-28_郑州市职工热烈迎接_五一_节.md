    Zhengzhou workers are enthusiastically welcoming "May Day" with unparalleled labor enthusiasm. Workers at the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are focusing all their efforts on striving for full production by "May Day" as a gift to the "May Day" Labor Day. The factory has partially started trial production, with the yarn quality reaching Grade A and the white cloth fully meeting standards. This year, the factory will be able to supply urban and rural people with cloth equivalent to more than 160% of the total provincial woven fabric production last year. To overcome abnormal phenomena that occur during the operation of new machines and ensure timely and smooth operation on "May Day," the factory's employees often work until late at night. Workers at the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory are taking practical actions to welcome "May Day." Wang Zhiye, a worker in the lathe workshop, researched and modified the use of triangular belt pulleys to increase the speed. As a result, seven four-foot small lathes have been accelerated from the original 580 revolutions to 920 revolutions to 1300 revolutions, thus completing the April production plan five to ten days ahead of schedule. The factory has now successfully completed the trial manufacturing of seven new products and the preparation for manufacturing all new products. Workers at the newly built Zhengzhou Power Plant are more conscientiously implementing the more than 200 rationalization proposals they put forward at the production representative meeting to welcome "May Day," ensuring that abundant current is safely and economically delivered to various factories, construction sites, and electricity users.

    郑州市职工热烈迎接“五一”节
    郑州市的工人们正以无比的劳动热情迎接“五一”节。国营郑州第一棉纺织厂的工人们，正集中全力以争取“五一”全面开工生产，做为向“五一”劳动节的献礼。该厂已部分开始试车生产，纱的质量达到甲等，白布也完全符合标准。该厂今年内就能以等于去年全省机织布总产量百分之一百六十以上的布匹供应城乡人民。该厂职工为克服新机器运转时所发生的不正常现象，以保证“五一”节按时顺利转动，时常工作到深夜。国营郑州纺织机械厂职工，纷纷以实际行动迎接“五一”节。车工间工人王治业研究改用三角皮带轮加快转速的结果，现已有七部四尺小元车从原来五百八十转加快到九百二十转至一千三百转，因此提前五天至十天完成了四月份生产计划。现该厂已胜利完成了七种新产品的试造工作，和制造全部新产品的准备工作。新建郑州发电厂的职工们，为迎接“五一”节，更加认真地执行着他们在生产代表会议上提出的二百多条合理化建议，保证把充裕的电流安全、经济地送给各个工厂、工地和用电户。  （吕建中）
