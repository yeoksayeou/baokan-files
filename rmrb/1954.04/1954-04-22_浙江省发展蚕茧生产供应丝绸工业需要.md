Zhejiang Province is actively developing silkworm cocoon production this year to meet the needs of the national silk industry. The allocation of silkworm eggs this year has increased by 12.5% ​​compared to last year, requiring a 14% increase in fresh cocoon production. According to preliminary statistics, the province has expanded mulberry garden areas in mountainous regions by more than 22,500 mu this year. Silkworm eggs have been released from warehouses successively since April 9. Counties such as Shengxian and Xinchang, which started raising silkworms earlier, have begun to force-hatch. Currently, all 66 forcing-hatching rooms in the province are about to fully enter the forcing-hatching stage.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of spring cocoons, Party committees and people's governments at all levels in the silkworm areas have transported and sold more than 70 million mulberry saplings. In addition to expanding the mulberry garden area in mountainous areas, approximately 20 million saplings have been replanted in the plain silkworm areas. They are currently continuing to mobilize farmers to do a good job in transplanting 100 million wide seedlings for the needs of developing silkworm cocoon production next year. All counties have universally convened meetings of silkworm farmer representatives to publicize the guidelines and policies regarding silkworm and mulberry production, mobilize silkworm farmers to actively increase production, and support national construction. They are also developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, further implementing the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and developing silkworm rearing collective rooms. Actively training silkworm farming activists to improve silkworm rearing techniques.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of spring cocoon purchasing work, cooperatives in various places are actively adding new stoves and renovating coal stoves, striving to complete all preparations for collection and drying by early May. The broad masses of silkworm farmers are carrying out disinfection of silkworm rearing equipment and silkworm rearing rooms and preparing to arrange collective rearing rooms in order to welcome the spring cocoon production season.

    浙江省发展蚕茧生产供应丝绸工业需要
    浙江省为适应国家丝绸工业的需要，今年积极发展蚕茧生产。今年配发蚕种比去年增加百分之十二点五，要求增产鲜茧百分之十四。今年全省扩大山区桑园面积据初步统计已达二万二千五百余亩。四月九日起，蚕种已陆续出库。养蚕较早的嵊县、新昌等县已开始催青，目前，全省六十六处催青室就要全面进入催青阶段。
    蚕区各级党委与人民政府，为了争取春茧丰收，共已运销桑苗七千余万株，除扩大山区桑园面积外，平原蚕区补植了约二千万株，目前正在继续动员农民做好一亿株广秧的移栽工作，以供明年发展蚕茧生产的需要。各县普遍召开了蚕农代表会议，宣传关于蚕桑生产的方针、政策，动员蚕农积极增产，支援国家建设。并发展互助合作运动，进一步贯彻自愿互利原则，发展养蚕共育室。训练蚕农积极分子，提高养蚕技术。
      为保证做好春茧收购工作，各地合作社正在积极添建新灶、改建煤灶，争取在五月上旬做好各项收烘准备工作。广大蚕农为迎接春茧生产，正在紧张进行蚕具、蚕室消毒，并筹备布置共育室。
