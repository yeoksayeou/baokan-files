Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th: The CCP Central Committee's Central and Southern Bureau has requested that all localities in Central and Southern China make every effort to successfully establish the agricultural production cooperatives that were newly established last winter and this spring. From March 16th to 26th, the Central and Southern Bureau convened a regional mutual aid and cooperation symposium. At the meeting, the work of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives was inspected, the pilot experience of various provinces was discussed, and requirements for continuing to successfully run the new cooperatives were put forward.

After the publicity of the General Line in the Central and Southern region, the enthusiasm of farmers to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been very high. According to statistics up to mid-March, 3,697 agricultural production cooperatives have been newly established in the region, and another 1,036 cooperatives will be completed soon. The above-mentioned more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives have exceeded the original planned number of cooperative establishments by more than 88% last winter, accounting for 80% of the revised annual development plan. The pilot cooperative establishment plans of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have been completed this year, and they will now shift to consolidation work; no more pilot programs will be conducted before autumn. Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi will develop another 1,100 cooperatives before autumn. In this way, nearly 6,000 new cooperatives will be piloted throughout the region this year, which is more than six times the number of agricultural production cooperatives (931) in the entire region before last autumn. The more than 3,600 cooperatives that have been established include more than 70,000 farm households; the more than 900 old cooperatives in the entire region have expanded from more than 15,000 households to more than 20,800 households during this period. Except for nine counties in the ethnic minority areas of Guangdong and Guangxi, all more than 500 counties in the region have agricultural production cooperatives. Guangdong Province did not have a single agricultural production cooperative before this, and this time 225 new ones have been established. Henan Province originally had more than 800 agricultural production cooperatives, and now has 2,775. One hundred and thirteen villages in the five special districts of Anyang, Xinxiang, Puyang, Xuchang, and Xinyang have basically been cooperativized. Among the above-mentioned more than 3,600 cooperatives, 43 are production cooperatives for vegetables, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, fruit trees, tea, etc. During this period, mutual aid teams have also developed greatly. According to statistics from five provinces and one city (excluding Guangdong and Guangzhou): before last winter, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations accounted for 30% of the total number of farm households, and now accounts for 38.7%. Judging from the situation reflected at the symposium, most of these new cooperatives were established on the basis of the original mutual aid teams, with the exception of a very small number that were directly organized by individual farmers. Generally, each cooperative has an average of eight or nine fair, capable, and active backbone members. In the process of establishing cooperatives, most cooperatives have come up with many ways to increase production in accordance with local conditions. As soon as they were established, they formulated production increase plans and put them into spring plowing production. This is the main aspect of the Central and Southern region's cooperative establishment.

The symposium also studied the situation that about half of the new cooperatives still lacked sufficient ideological mobilization, about 10% of the new cooperatives had even worse ideological mobilization and weaker backbones, and that due to lack of experience, half of the cooperatives handled the members' contributions of production materials and income distribution relatively crudely, and 10% of the cooperatives had many outstanding problems. Based on this, it was pointed out that under the principle of active and steady progress, the current work of piloting new cooperatives should immediately stop development and fully shift to consolidation work. All cadres who lead farmers to establish cooperatives should continue to help farmers run the existing new cooperatives well. The meeting pointed out that the central link in running cooperatives well is to do a good job in production, mobilize cooperative members to tap production potential, find ways to increase production, and revise production plans. At the same time, it is necessary to rationally organize the labor force and earnestly do a good job in evaluating work and recording points. After these cooperatives shift to production, conduct another general inspection to seriously solve outstanding problems and rationally revise the income distribution system. For agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously organized by farmers or rural cadres, the situation should be clarified and handled separately. Those that meet the conditions should be approved and strengthened leadership; those that do not meet the conditions should be helped to transform into mutual aid teams to continue to do a good job in production, so as to prepare conditions for future cooperative establishment. The meeting also requested that party committees at all levels strengthen leadership over the local mutual aid and cooperation movement, accumulate experience in running cooperatives; especially requiring district-level leaders to learn how to run cooperatives, and requiring all localities not to ignore the leadership of mutual aid teams. In areas where the development of mutual aid teams is insufficient, appropriate development should be carried out; on this basis, carry out a production movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

    中共中央中南局召开全区互助合作座谈会
    要各地办好新建农业生产合作社
    【新华社武汉六日电】　中共中央中南局要求中南各地全力办好去冬今春新建的农业生产合作社。从三月十六日到二十六日，中南局召开了全区互助合作座谈会。会上，检查了新建农业生产合作社工作，座谈了各省的试办经验，提出了继续办好新社的要求。
    中南区经过宣传总路线后，农民要求参加互助合作运动的积极性非常高涨。截至三月中旬的统计，全区已新建成三千六百九十七个农业生产合作社，另有一千零三十六个社最近就可建成。上述四千多个农业生产合作社，已超过去冬原订建社计划数的百分之八十八以上，占修订后的年度发展计划的百分之八十。湖北、湖南、江西今年试办建社计划已经完成，今后即转入巩固工作；秋前不再试办。河南、广东、广西三省秋前还将再发展一千一百多个社。这样，全区今年度试办的新社将近六千个，等于去年秋前全区原有农业生产合作社（九百三十一个）的六倍以上。已建成的三千六百多个社，包括七万多农户；全区原有的九百多个老社，在此期间由一万五千多户扩展为二万零八百多户。除广东、广西少数民族地区的九个县外，全区五百多县每县都有了农业生产合作社。广东省在此以前没有一个农业生产合作社，这次新建成了二百二十五个。河南省原有八百多个农业生产合作社，现已有二千七百七十五个。安阳、新乡、濮阳、许昌、信阳五个专区已有一百一十三个村基本上合作化了。上述三千六百多个社中，有四十三个是蔬菜、林业、渔业、畜牧、果树、茶叶等生产合作社。在这期间，互助组也有很大发展。据五省一市（缺广东和广州）统计：去冬以前参加互助合作组织的农户占总农户数的百分之三十，现在占百分之三十八点七。从座谈会上反映的情况看：这批新社除极少数是由单干农户直接组织的以外，大都是在原有的互助组基础上建成的。一般每个社平均都有八、九个公道、能干、积极的骨干分子。大部社在建社过程中，因地制宜地想了许多增产办法，一建成就订出增产计划投入了春耕生产。这就是中南区建社的主要的方面。
    座谈会也研究了约有一半的新社思想发动尚欠充分，约百分之十的新社思想发动更差，骨干也弱，以及由于缺乏经验，有一半社对社员入社生产资料和收益分配的处理较粗糙，有百分之十的社遗留问题很多等情况，并据以指出：在积极稳步的方针下，当前试办新社工作应即停止发展，全力转入巩固工作。所有领导农民建社的干部，应继续帮助农民把现有的新社办好。会议指出：办好社的中心环节是搞好生产，发动社员挖掘生产潜力，找增产门路，修订生产计划。同时要合理组织劳动力，切实做好评工记分工作。在这些社转入生产后，再普遍检查一次，认真解决遗留问题，合理修订收益分配制度。对于农民或乡村干部自发组织起来的农业生产合作社，应即摸清情况以后分别处理，够条件的应予批准并加强领导；不够条件的，帮助其转变为互助组，继续搞好生产，以为将来建社准备条件。会议并要求各级党委加强对当地互助合作运动的领导，积累办社经验；特别要求区级领导学会办社、要求各地不要忽视对互助组的领导，凡互助组发展不够的地区，应再适当发展；在这个基础上开展以互助合作为中心的生产运动。
