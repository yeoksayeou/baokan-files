Making a Good Job of Spring Planting to Guarantee Increased Agricultural Production

    All regions generally emphasize increased peanut production
    In order to greatly increase oil crops, regions suitable for planting peanuts are actively expanding their planting area and promoting the method of inoculating seeds with rhizobia. Jiangsu Province's peanut planting area this year has expanded by 55% compared to last year. Hebei, Guangdong, Shandong, Guangxi and other provinces have also expanded by 6% to 31%. In order to ensure the completion of the peanut sowing plan, oil companies in various regions are actively carrying out seed supply work. According to statistics from the oil companies in Wendeng, Laiyang, Jiaozhou and other regions of Shandong Province, a total of more than 37 million jin of white-skinned, large-grain peanut seeds have been prepared and have been sold or loaned to farmers by local supply and marketing cooperatives. Many regions have also solved the difficulty of lacking peanut seeds through mutual assistance and mutual borrowing.
    In terms of increasing yield per unit area, various regions are actively promoting inoculation with rhizobia. This year, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute has manufactured a large number of "Peanut Rhizobium Inoculant" to supply various regions. The Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute and Shandong, Henan and other provinces have also begun manufacturing this year. According to preliminary statistics, the inoculation area nationwide this year can reach about 1.9 million mu, an increase of about four times compared to last year, which will play a significant role in increasing peanut production this year. At present, the rhizobium inoculants manufactured by the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute and other places have been successively transported to the promotion areas. Jiangsu Province plans to teach inoculation techniques layer by layer from the special districts to the counties and districts in the process of promotion, so as to give full play to the role of inoculation in increasing production.

    各地普遍重视花生增产
    为了大量增产油料作物，适宜种植花生的地区积极扩大种植面积，并推广根瘤拌种方法。江苏省今年种植花生面积，较去年扩大百分之五十五，河北、广东、山东、广西等省也都扩大百分之六至百分之三十一。为了保证花生播种计划的完成，各地油脂公司积极进行种子供应工作。现据山东省文登、莱阳、胶州等专区油脂公司统计，共准备了白皮大粒花生种三千七百多万斤，已由当地供销合作社出售或贷放给农民。很多地区并通过互助互借办法解决了缺花生种的困难。
    在提高单位面积产量方面，各地正积极推广根瘤菌拌种。今年华北农业科学研究所大量制造“花生根瘤菌拌种剂”供应各地。东北农业科学研究所及山东、河南等省今年也开始制造。据初步统计，全国今年拌种面积可达到一百九十万亩左右，约较去年增加四倍，对今年增产花生将起很大作用。目前，华北农业科学研究所等地制造的根瘤拌种剂已先后分运至推广地区。江苏省准备在推广过程中，由专区到县区层层传授拌种技术，充分发挥拌种增产的作用。
