      Spring patriotic health campaigns have been widely launched in Gui Sui, Baotou and other places in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. At present, patriotic health campaign committees have been established in various places, and publicity and mobilization work has begun among the broad masses of the people. So far, the three cities of Gui Sui, Baotou, and Ulanhot have held symposiums for relevant personnel from government agencies and organizations, as well as meetings for street cadres and the masses, organized by district. After sub-district publicity and mobilization, government agencies, organizations, and residents of all ethnic groups on the streets have begun to clean up indoor and outdoor environmental sanitation, remove garbage and feces, dredge ditches, and repair seepage pits. Some government agencies, organizations, and residents have also begun to dig for pupae. In addition, Gui Sui City is preparing to conduct a sanitation inspection in mid-April focusing on factories, construction sites, schools, the catering industry, and major transportation arteries. In mobilizing women of all ethnic groups to participate in the spring sanitation campaign, the suburbs of Ulanhot City have also carried out activities such as evaluating model workers.

      归绥、包头等地开展春季爱国卫生运动
    春季爱国卫生运动已在内蒙古自治区归绥、包头等地普遍展开。现在，各地都已成立了爱国卫生运动委员会，并开始向广大人民进行了宣传动员工作。到目前为止，归绥、包头、乌兰浩特三市都以区为单位分别召开了机关团体有关人员座谈会和街道干部、群众会。经过分片宣传动员后，机关团体和街道各族居民已开始打扫室内外环境卫生、清除垃圾粪便、疏通沟渠、整修渗水坑等。有些机关团体和居民还开始挖蛹。此外，归绥市并准备在四月中旬以工厂、工地、学校、饮食行业及交通大道为重点进行一次卫生检查。乌兰浩特市郊区在动员各族妇女参加春季卫生运动中，还进行了评比模范等工作。
