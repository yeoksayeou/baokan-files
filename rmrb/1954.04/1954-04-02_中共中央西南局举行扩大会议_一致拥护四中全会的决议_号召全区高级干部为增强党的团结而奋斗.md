    【Benbao Chongqing, 31st dispatch】The Southwest China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held its 12th enlarged meeting from March 13th to 24th to discuss the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC. Participating in the meeting were the secretaries and deputy secretaries of each province and city, cadres at the level of prefectural committee secretary or above from Southwest level organs and the Chongqing Municipal Committee, and cadres above the division level from the armed forces, totaling more than 300 people. After listening to the reports by Comrade He Long, Secretary of the Southwest China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Song Renqiong, First Deputy Secretary, on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, the enlarged meeting held earnest discussions. The comrades who attended received extremely profound education, raised their political awareness, and also conducted serious self-criticism in connection with the issues of party unity and collective leadership. All cadres present unanimously endorsed the report to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session. Finally, a resolution was unanimously adopted. The resolution pointed out: 1. The enlarged meeting unanimously believes that the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong is entirely correct. The fact that the Southwest region has achieved certain successes in its work since liberation is precisely due to the resolute support and implementation of the correct political and organizational line of the Party Central Committee. In the future, it is still necessary to follow the general line of the Party in the transition period proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, to work diligently, to strive to overcome shortcomings and errors in the work constantly, and to be constantly vigilant against any complacency. 2. The enlarged meeting unanimously believes that the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee is very timely and correct. The enlarged meeting unanimously believes that to ensure the implementation of this resolution, first of all, responsible cadres above the provincial (municipal) committee level and senior responsible cadres of the armed forces must recognize that party unity is the basic guarantee for the victory of China's socialist revolution; and the unity of senior cadres is the key to the unity of the entire party. Therefore, among senior cadres, it is necessary to raise political awareness and revolutionary vigilance, to criticize and struggle against any words and deeds that undermine party unity, and to strive to enhance party unity.
