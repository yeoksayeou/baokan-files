　　Our Country's Construction Technicians on Korean Construction Sites
　　On November 4th of last year, the first group of Chinese construction technicians aiding North Korea's post-war recovery and construction crossed the Yalu River into North Korea. Now, they are working enthusiastically on various construction sites in North Korea.
　　This group of construction technicians is divided into six groups, working on the construction sites of the Korean Central Government Office Building, Mangyongdae Revolutionary Family Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office Building, "Rodong Sinmun" newspaper building, Construction University, and Pyongyang General Hospital. They have a very high level of enthusiasm for their work. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office Building construction site, they completed the construction plan ahead of schedule. At the "Rodong Sinmun" newspaper building construction site, they are engaged in a friendly competition with Korean workers and technicians. Korean comrades exceeded the Chinese comrades by 121%, and the Chinese comrades exceeded the Korean comrades by 23%. Wang Mingtian, a Chinese bricklayer working on the construction site of the Mangyongdae Revolutionary Family Institute, the hometown of Marshal Kim Il-sung, wrote in his diary: "I feel very honored to be working in the hometown of Marshal Kim Il-sung, the wise leader of the Korean people. Today, I stand on the high scaffolding of the academy's construction project and happily build the wall. This is the academy for the children of the Korean revolutionary martyrs, and we must build it into a beautiful and magnificent academy as soon as possible." When the Chinese construction technicians participating in the reconstruction of the Pyongyang General Hospital heard that on September 19, 1950, American planes dropped more than 400 bombs on the hospital, killing many seriously ill patients and more than 30 pregnant women and their babies, they decided to complete the construction plan ahead of schedule to avenge the dead Korean mothers and babies.

　　Soviet Engineers at North Korean Agricultural Machinery School
　　Currently, in schools such as the North Korean Agricultural Machinery Technician Training Center, Pyongyang Agricultural Mechanization College, and Pyongyang Tractor Driver Training School, many young men and women from rural areas are studying under the kind guidance of Soviet technicians. They are studying subjects such as animal husbandry, horticulture, mechanization of agricultural product handling and loading/unloading operations, and water conservancy. All of their teaching materials are various tractors, new-style plows, combine harvesters, tillers, and seeders donated by the Soviet people. When students from the Agricultural Machinery Technician Training Center were busy practicing plowing the land with dozens of tractors on the practice field, Soviet engineer Alexander Petrov personally went to the practice field to guide the work. Petrov sat in the driver's seat of the tractor, specifically explaining the driving and operating methods to the students, and enthusiastically helped the Korean teachers with their teaching work.
　　Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet engineers, students can independently drive tractors in a very short time and learn various agricultural machinery repair methods. Student An Zhiyong said, "In my internship, I have become increasingly clear about how enormous the spiritual and economic assistance that the Soviet Union, China, and the people of fraternal countries have given to our country is, and how great a role this assistance will play in the recovery and development of our country's economy."

　　Czechoslovak People Donate Aid-Korea Fund
　　The people of Czechoslovakia are widely launching a campaign to raise aid for Korea, to help with Korea's recovery and construction.
　　Workers in various factories are increasing their working hours and donating the rewards of their extra labor. The workers of the Dimitrov factory in Bratislava donated 20,000 crowns (Czech currency) in one Sunday's work; the employees of the Česká Lípa engine section have donated more than 500 hours of extra labor on Sundays. Government employees are also practicing thrift and donating to the Aid-Korea Fund. Employees of the Czechoslovak government's transportation department have decided to purchase a tractor for 24,000 crowns and send it to Korea. Residents of cities and villages are also donating their savings. All the farmers in the village of Jutovte actively participated in this movement and donated a total of more than 4,500 crowns. Walekikba, a member of the Kbelisk Cooperative, decided to donate one crown from his salary every day, and his accumulated donations have now reached 490 crowns.
　　Czechoslovak actors have also widely held performances to aid Korea; students have also used their spare time to collect scrap iron and save study expenses to donate. As of November 26th of last year, 3.87 million crowns of Aid-Korea funds had been raised in twenty states, including Prague State.

　　Hungarian People Eager to Participate in Korean Construction
　　Recently, the Korean people have received many letters from the Hungarian people, filled with ardent desires to help the Korean people carry out recovery and construction.
　　The letter from the workers of the machine factory in Stalinvaros stated: "We are determined to complete the production plan so as to supply a large amount of equipment needed for the Korean recovery and construction undertaking." The letter from Betergo Chagalloy, a model automobile driver from Miercurea Ciuc, stated: "As a driver, together with my wife, I am determined to go to your beautiful homeland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which will be rebuilt, to participate in your recovery and construction undertaking, to take on transportation work, and the drivers and assistants who work with me have the same desire." The letter from the construction worker Gyula from Gyöngyösmiklós stated: "I am determined to contribute all my strength to the reconstruction of heroic Korea, which was destroyed by the American aggressors, based on my past experience in rebuilding Hungary, which was liberated from the aggression of the Hitler bandits."

　　我国建筑技术人员在朝鲜建筑工地上
    去年十一月四日，我国援助朝鲜战后恢复和建设的第一批建筑技术人员，跨过鸭绿江到了朝鲜。现在，他们正在朝鲜各个建筑工地上热情地工作着。
    这批建筑技术人员分成六组，分别在朝鲜中央政府办公厅、万景台革命遗族学院、外务省办公厅、“劳动新闻”报馆、建设大学、平壤综合医院等工地上进行工作。他们的劳动热情非常高。在外务省办公厅建筑工地上，他们提前完成了建筑计划；在“劳动新闻”报馆建筑工地上，他们正紧张地与朝鲜的工人和技术人员进行友谊的竞赛运动，朝鲜同志以百分之一百二十一的成绩超过了中国同志，中国同志又以百分之二十三的成绩超过了朝鲜同志。在金日成元帅故乡万景台革命遗族学院建筑工地上工作的我国砌砖工人王明天在他的日记上写道：“我觉得很光荣，因为我在朝鲜人民的英明领袖金日成元帅的故乡工作。今天我站在学院建筑工事的高高的搭板上愉快地砌墙。这里是朝鲜革命先烈子女们的学院，我们必须把它早日建筑成一个美丽而雄壮的学院。”参加平壤综合医院重建工作的我国建筑技术工人们，当听到一九五○年九月十九日，美国飞机在这个医院的上空投掷了四百多颗炸弹，许多重病号以及三十多名产妇和她们的婴孩们都被炸死的情形时，他们决定以提前完成建筑计划来为死难的朝鲜母亲和婴儿们复仇。
　　苏联工程师在朝鲜农业机械学校里
    目前，在朝鲜农业机械技术人员养成所、平壤农业机械化专门学校和平壤拖拉机驾驶员讲习所等学校里，有很多农村青年男女在苏联技术人员的亲切指导下进行学习。他们学习的科目是：畜牧、园艺、农产品搬运装卸作业机械化和水利等。他们所有的教材是苏联人民赠送的各种拖拉机、新式犁、康拜因、耕田机和播种机等机械。　当农业机械技术人员养成所的学生们在实习场上用几十架拖拉机忙着实习耕地的时候，苏联工程师亚历山大·彼得洛夫亲自到实习场上去指导工作。彼得洛夫坐在托拉机的驾驶台上，向学生们具体地讲述驾驶法和操纵法，并热心地帮助朝鲜教员们进行教学工作。
    在苏联工程师的热心指导下，学生们很短时间内就能单独驾驶拖拉机，并学会了各种农业机械的修理法。学生安致永说：“我在实习生活中越来越明确地认识到苏联、中国和各兄弟国家人民给我国的精神上和经济上的帮助有多么巨大，这个帮助在我国人民经济的恢复和发展中将起多么大的作用。”
　　捷克斯洛伐克人民捐献援朝基金
    捷克斯洛伐克人民，正广泛地展开募集援朝基金运动，以帮助朝鲜的恢复和建设。
    各工厂的工人们，都增加劳动时间，捐献额外劳动的报酬。布拉智斯拉巴市季米特洛夫工厂的工人们，在一个星期日的劳动中，就捐献了二万克朗（捷币）；捷斯卡亚利巴机务段的员工们，已捐出了五百多小时的星期额外劳动。机关人员也实行节约，捐献援朝基金。捷克斯洛伐克政府交通运输部门职员们，决定以二万四千克朗购买拖拉机一架送到朝鲜去。城市和乡村的居民，也把他们积蓄捐献出来。居托夫捷村的全体农民都热烈参加了这个运动，一共捐献了四千五百多克朗。克贝利斯克合作社社员瓦列基克巴，决定每天从工资中拿出一克朗来捐献，现在他积蓄的捐款已达四百九十克朗。
    捷克斯洛伐克的演员们，也广泛地举行了援朝演出；学生们也利用课余时间，搜集废铁，并节约学习费用来捐献。截至去年十一月二十六日为止，在布拉格州等二十个州中，已募集了三百八十七万克朗的援朝基金。
　　匈牙利人民热望参加朝鲜建设
    最近，朝鲜人民收到了许多匈牙利人民的来信，信中充满了援助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设事业的热烈愿望。
    斯大林巴洛斯市机器工厂工人们的信中写道：“我们决心完成生产计划，以便大量地供应朝鲜恢复建设事业中所需要的器材。”米捷卡诺市模范汽车司机别捷戈查加洛伊的信中写道：“我以一个司机的身分，和我的妻子一起，决心要到你们将被重建起来的美丽的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国去，参加你们的恢复建设事业，担任运输工作，和我一起工作的司机和助手们，都有这样的愿望。”吉散特米克洛斯市的建筑工朱拉的信中写道：“我决心象重建从希特勒匪帮的侵略中解放了的匈牙利一样，根据我过去得到的经验，为重建被美国侵略者所破坏的英雄朝鲜而贡献我的一切力量。”
