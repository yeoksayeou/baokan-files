Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on April 15th: North Vietnamese People's Armed Forces eliminated over 1,000 enemy troops in counter-sweep operations in Bac Ninh and Son Tay provinces.

In four days of counter-sweep operations from April 4th to 7th in Bac Ninh province, the People's Armed Forces annihilated over 600 enemy troops from the 4th and 8th Mobile Groups who were conducting a "sweep" in Thuan Thanh district, and destroyed eight enemy vehicles. This "sweep" by the enemy began on March 28th, with the aim of eliminating the threats along Highway 5 and the Hai Phong-Hanoi railway.

On March 28th, the enemy massed many mobile units in the Thach That area of Son Tay province to conduct a "sweep," attempting to deal with the increasingly intensified guerrilla warfare in Son Tay province. However, under the tenacious resistance of the People's Armed Forces, the enemy suffered 515 casualties, including one major and five lieutenants.

In addition, on April 4th, the People's Army attacked the enemy stronghold of Vi Phu in Nam Truc district, Nam Dinh province, completely annihilating the 210 enemy troops stationed there, and seizing over 100 machine guns and rifles, as well as a large amount of ammunition. Three days earlier, the People's Army had eradicated an enemy stronghold in Thanh Oai district, Ha Dong province, completely annihilating the defending enemy. On the 10th, the People's Army attacked the French military stronghold of Hoai Bao Cang, located seven kilometers southwest of Bac Ninh province's capital, eliminating 120 enemy troops. On the 4th, the People's Armed Forces also sank and destroyed three enemy motorboats in the Thai Binh area, killing and capturing over 100 enemy troops.

Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: According to Vietnam News Agency: On the 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army shelled the enemy artillery positions in Muong Thanh, the center of the Dien Bien Phu fortified group, destroying twelve enemy cannons, thereby greatly reducing the enemy's artillery firepower on that day. At the same time, an enemy gasoline depot in Muong Thanh was hit and caught fire. The People's Army also captured many enemy airdropped supplies around Dien Bien Phu.
