Popularizing Scientific and Technological Knowledge Among the Masses
——Congratulations on the Opening of the “Scientific Education Film Exhibition”
Mao Yisheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization

The "Scientific Education Film Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, has opened in the capital and will be held successively in major cities across the country. Thirteen scientific education films produced in our own country will be screened during the exhibition. This is an unprecedented event in the history of education in our country, as well as in the history of film. In the early stage of our country's great socialist construction, being able to use film, such a powerful propaganda tool, to conduct popular science and technology education for the broad masses, improve the scientific and technological level of the masses, and better serve construction through science, is truly a matter worth celebrating.

Among the films in this exhibition, some explain natural phenomena, such as "Solar and Lunar Eclipses"; some introduce advanced experiences in industrial and agricultural production, such as "Hao Jianxiu's Working Method" and "How to Achieve High-Yield Cotton"; and some introduce sports and health knowledge, such as "Painless Childbirth." Through these films, the masses will broaden their horizons in science and technology, learn some advanced production experiences, and increase their scientific knowledge.

As a result of long-term oppression and exploitation in the past, the general scientific and technological level of our working people is not high. The rapid development of our country's construction cause makes the masses' demand for learning science and technology extremely urgent. However, regular and systematic formal scientific education cannot be expanded very quickly and widely at present. Therefore, various forms are needed to popularize science and technology among the masses. Among all existing forms of publicity, film is the most mass-oriented and most powerful tool. It can vividly present scientific content that meets practical needs and is suitable for the general public on the screen in an easy-to-understand way, and can educate more people in a shorter time and in the most economical way. This form of "illustrated popular lectures" was highly valued by Lenin. Such films have achieved great success in the Soviet Union. In our country, it is only the beginning. The scientific education films in this exhibition have been able to initially meet the requirements of popularizing scientific knowledge in terms of educational significance. We hope to receive criticism from the masses and gradually improve them.

In the process of realizing the general line for the transition period of the state, the popularization of science and technology education is of particular importance. To achieve socialist industrialization, we must establish new industrial bases, reform the old technical equipment, and create new technical equipment suitable for the needs of our industrial development. To transform agriculture, we need advanced farming methods. All of this requires us to have a high level of science and technology. We must have a high technical foundation so that socialist construction can be completed more quickly. We not only require technical personnel and scientific workers to improve their level, but also to continuously improve the technical level of the broad masses. A high level of technology is based on popular science, so the popularization of science and technology education has become an indispensable means for cultivating the high technology of the masses. When the masses have established a preliminary technical foundation, the demand for improvement is even more urgent. In the ongoing national patriotic labor production competitions, labor models and advanced workers are constantly emerging, and their inventions and creations are changing with each passing day. All of this shows that in our production and construction, the primary competition movement to strengthen labor intensity has gradually developed into an advanced competition combining labor and technology. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses for learning science and technology is very high.

Our scientific workers are willing to contribute their greatest efforts to the masses' urgent demand for learning science. We should make full use of film as a tool to send general scientific knowledge and the results of scientific research to the masses. We must cooperate closely with filmmakers to produce more and better scientific education films, and through various popularization activities, make the scientific work of New China a mass undertaking. Only in this way can we combine scientific theory with mass experience, and combine scientific research with production work.

Scientific education films are a record of the combination of mass wisdom and scientific theory. After learning these educational films, the masses will inevitably gain new inspiration. They will not only be able to promote existing advanced experiences, but also create new experiences based on the inspiration from the films, and improve technology one step further. Scientific workers can also see the development of science and technology in practical life from the films, thereby improving their theories. Through such mutual inspiration, scientific education films will gradually become a powerful assistant in establishing a high technical foundation. Scientific education films have extremely broad development prospects in the great cause of socialist construction in the motherland.

Under the brilliant light of the general line, our scientific workers must make better use of scientific education films to carry out popular science work, promote mass wisdom, and strive to complete the socialist construction of the motherland at an early date!

### 把科学技术知识普及到群众中去——祝“科学教育影片展览”开幕

    把科学技术知识普及到群众中去
    ——祝“科学教育影片展览”开幕
    中华全国科学技术普及协会副主席　茅以升
    中央文化部电影局和中华全国科学技术普及协会联合举办的“科学教育影片展览”，已在首都开幕，并将在全国各大城市陆续举行。我国自己摄制的十三部科学教育影片，将在展览期间放映。这是我国教育历史上，同时也是电影历史上的一个创举。在我们国家进行伟大的社会主义建设的初期，就能利用电影这样有力的宣传工具，向广大群众进行有关科学和技术的普及教育，提高群众的科学和技术水平，使科学更好地为建设服务，实在是一件值得庆贺的事情。
    在这次展览的影片中，有解释自然现象的，如
  “日食与月食”；有介绍工农业生产先进经验的，如“郝建秀工作法”“怎样丰产棉花”等；有介绍体育卫生知识的，如“无痛分娩”等。通过这些影片，群众将扩大在科学技术上的眼界，学习到一些先进的生产经验，和增长不少科学知识。
    我们劳动人民由于过去长期受压迫和受剥削的结果，一般的科学技术水平是不高的，目前我国建设事业的迅速发展，使群众对于学习科学技术的要求异常迫切。但经常化、系统化的各项正规科学教育，目前尚不能很迅速广泛地展开，因而就需要多种多样的形式，将科学技术普及到群众当中去。在现有的一切宣传形式中，电影是最群众化的、最有力的工具。它可以把切合实际需要、适合一般群众水平的科学内容，通俗易懂地用活的形象显现在银幕上，并能在较短时间内，以最经济的方法，对较多的群众进行教育。这种“形象化的通俗演讲”的形式，是很为列宁重视的。这种影片在苏联已有极高的成就。在我国，则仅仅是开始。这次展览的科学教育影片，在教育意义上，已能初步达到普及科学知识的要求，我们希望得到群众的批评，逐步加以改善。
      在实现国家过渡时期总路线中，科学和技术的普及教育是具有特殊重要意义的。我们要实现社会主义工业化，就要建立新的工业基地，要改革旧有的技术装备，创造适合我们工业发展需要的新的技术装备。我们要改造农业，就需要有先进的耕作方法。所有这一切都需要我们有高度的科学和技术水平。我们必须要有高度的技术基础，社会主义建设才能加速完成。我们不但要求技术人员和科学工作者都要提高水平，而且要使广大群众的技术水平都能不断地提高。高度的技术是以普及的科学为基础的，因而科学和技术的普及教育成为培养群众的高度技术不可缺少的手段。在群众已经建立了初步技术基础的时候，提高的要求就更为迫切。在经常的全国性的爱国主义劳动生产竞赛中，不断地涌现出劳动模范和先进工作者，他们的创造发明更是日新月异，这一切都说明在我们生产建设中，加强劳动强度的初级竞赛运动，已经逐渐发展到劳动与技术相结合的高级竞赛，因而群众学习科学技术的热情是很高的。
    我们科学工作者对于群众迫切要求学习科学的热情，是愿意贡献出最大的力量的。我们应该充分利用电影这种工具，把一般科学知识和科学研究的成果送到群众中去。我们要和电影工作者密切合作，出产更多更好的科学教育片，并通过各种普及活动，使新中国的科学工作成为群众性的事业。只有这样，才能把科学理论和群众经验结合起来，把科学研究和生产工作结合起来。
    科学教育影片是群众智慧和科学理论相结合的纪录。群众在学习了这些教育片以后，必然会得到新的启示，不但能推广已有的先进经验，而且由于从影片得到启发，又能创造新的经验，将技术提高一步。科学工作者也可从影片里看到科学技术在实际生活中的发展，从而在理论上有所提高。通过这样相互的启发作用，科学教育影片就逐渐成为建立高度技术基础的有力助手。科学教育影片在祖国社会主义建设的伟大事业里，是有其极广阔的发展前途的。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们科学工作者要更好地运用科学教育影片，来开展科学普及工作，发扬群众智慧，为早日完成祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗！
