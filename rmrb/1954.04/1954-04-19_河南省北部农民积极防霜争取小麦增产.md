Northern Henan farmers are actively preventing frost to strive for increased wheat production. After the Central Meteorological Observatory issued a gale warning on the 6th of this month, the relevant leading organs in Henan Province urgently instructed the area north of the Yellow River in the province to pay attention to frost prevention. Many village farmers, learning from the severe frost damage to wheat last year, immediately carried out organized and prepared frost prevention activities. For example, the wheat seedlings in Guowangdu Township, Anyang, are particularly robust this year. Farmers are actively watering and applying top dressing, demanding that the yield be at least 10% higher than last year. After receiving the frost prevention instructions, the township branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the township people's government immediately established an emergency frost prevention command post. The township branch secretary served as the commander-in-chief, leading the production team leaders and mutual aid group leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives to the fields to divide the prevention areas. The township head was responsible for organizing the masses and preparing 5,000 jin of firewood, which was placed beside the wheat fields in each prevention area.

On the night of the 7th, the temperature continued to drop from two degrees Celsius towards the freezing point. The local farmers went to the fields and lit bonfires. On the vast plains along the Beijing-Hankou Railway in Anyang, a blaze of fire suddenly lit up, followed by countless plumes of smoke rising and spreading out. A train departing from Anyang Station was completely obscured by the white smoke; only the increasingly distant rumble could be heard. By the time the east turned red, the layer of white smoke enveloping the earth gradually disappeared, and the farmers discussed the victory of this struggle between man and nature with joyful expressions. Some said, "Last year the wheat suffered, this year man triumphs over nature." Now they are continuing to prepare for frost prevention until the critical period for wheat frost prevention around Grain Rain has passed. (Lü Jianzhong)

    河南省北部农民积极防霜争取小麦增产
    河南省北部农民积极防霜，争取小麦增产。本月六日中央气象台发出大风消息后，河南省有关领导机关便紧急指示该省黄河以北地区注意防霜，不少乡村农民接受去年小麦遭受严重霜灾的教训，立即有组织、有准备地进行防霜活动。如安阳郭王度乡今年麦苗特别肥壮，农民正积极浇水，追肥，要求产量至少达到比去年增加一成，接到防霜指示后，中共乡支部和乡人民政府当天便成立了紧急防霜指挥部，乡支部书记任总指挥，领着农业生产合作社各个生产队长和互助组长们到田里划分防区，乡长负责组织群众并筹备了五千斤柴草分置在各个防区的麦地边。
    七日夜晚，气温由摄氏两度继续向水点下降，当地农民便到田野里燃起了烟火。安阳沿京汉铁路两侧苍茫的原野上，顿然亮起一片火光，接着就是数不清的烟柱，升上去，又散开来。从安阳车站开出的一列火车，全被白烟遮住了，只听见越来越远的轰隆声。到东方发红的时候，笼罩着大地的一层白烟才逐渐消失，农民们喜形于色地谈论着这一阵人与自然斗争的胜利。有的说：“去年麦受害，今年人胜天。”现在他们还继续进行防霜准备，直到谷雨前后小麦防霜的紧要时期过去为止。（吕建中）
