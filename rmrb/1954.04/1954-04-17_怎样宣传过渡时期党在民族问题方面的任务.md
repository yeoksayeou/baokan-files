    How to Propagate the Party's Tasks on the Nationalities Question During the Transition Period

    During the period of our country's gradual transition to socialism, the Party's general task on the nationalities question is: to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities, and to jointly build the great family of the motherland; within the unified great family of the motherland, to guarantee equality in all rights for all nationalities, and to implement national regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all nationalities, to gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities between nationalities left over by history, to enable backward nationalities to join the ranks of advanced nationalities, and to gradually transition to socialist society. To thoroughly and universally propagate this general task to the people of minority nationalities, to call on everyone and organize everyone to strive for the realization of this general task, this is the specific requirement when propagating the general line of the state during the transition period in minority nationality areas.

    When propagating the general line of the state during the transition period and the Party's tasks on the nationalities question to minority nationalities, it is first necessary to tell the people of all minority nationalities in our country that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country has begun a new period, which is a new period of gradual transition to socialism. For more than four years now, the people of all nationalities in our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, have achieved the complete independence and unification of the country, and the people of all nationalities are closely united in a free and equal great family. The people's democratic regime led by the working class has been greatly consolidated. Thanks to the victory of economic recovery, the productivity of industry and agriculture in our country has greatly increased, and the main industrial and agricultural products have exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history, and the people's lives have generally been initially improved. Our country began planned economic construction in 1953. Under the illumination of the general line of the transition period, our country will be transformed from an industrially underdeveloped country into a highly developed socialist country.

    It should be made clear to the people of all nationalities that the nationalities work over the past four years has achieved significant successes. After more than four years of efforts, all nationalities are becoming more and more united with each other and within themselves, and the political, economic, and cultural education undertakings in various minority nationality areas are developing rapidly. Tremendous changes are taking place in both agricultural and pastoral areas, cities and villages. By 1953, 48 national autonomous regions above the county level had been established across the country, and minority nationalities had gained the right to be "masters of their own affairs." State-owned trading institutions have penetrated remote minority nationality areas and nomadic areas, supplying the people of all nationalities with production tools and daily necessities at reasonable prices, purchasing local and special products, and gradually improving the lives of minority nationality people. County-level health institutions have been established in various nationality areas, and medical teams are touring various places, providing free medical treatment for the people of all nationalities. The population of minority nationalities is gradually increasing. Land reform has been implemented in the agricultural areas, which account for nearly two-thirds of the total minority nationality population, and necessary democratic reforms have been carried out in some pastoral areas based on the voluntary wishes of local nationalities. The People's Government has helped the people of all nationalities develop agricultural and animal husbandry production by distributing agricultural tools, providing loans, building water conservancy projects, preventing and controlling animal epidemics, protecting pastures, and improving breeds. The transportation conditions in minority nationality areas are also constantly improving. In 1953, highway construction focused on minority nationality areas, and the total investment was approximately equal to the total investment in the past three years. Some minority nationality areas such as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang already have modern industries. At the end of 1952, there were more than 9,100 ethnic primary schools nationwide, more than 4,860 primary schools enrolling children of all ethnic groups, and approximately 100,000 minority nationality cadres nationwide.

    However, this is only the beginning of a great cause. In the future, with the gradual progress of the country's socialist industrialization, the construction undertakings in minority nationality areas will also continue to progress gradually. This means that our country will gradually build more factories, manufacture more new-style machines, agricultural tools, and inexpensive and high-quality daily necessities, and build more highways and railways to remote minority nationality areas in order to transport more industrial products and transport out local and special products, especially animal husbandry and sideline products. The backward tools used by minority nationality herdsmen for cutting grass, milking, shearing sheep, eliminating wolves, and protecting livestock will gradually be replaced by advanced tools. The medicines and medical personnel needed by people and livestock will also gradually become sufficient, increasing human health and reducing livestock mortality, and gradually improving livestock breeding methods, so that livestock can be raised better and reproduce more. Livestock products such as wool, cowhide, milk, and casings, as well as other local and special products produced by herdsmen, will be processed by factories into more suitable means of livelihood, in order to increase people's income and improve people's lives. As industry develops, the wooden farm tools and backward "slash-and-burn" farming methods used by minority nationality farmers will also gradually be replaced by new-style farm tools. Moreover, conditions will be created to build more and larger water conservancy projects, manufacture a large amount of chemical fertilizers, and open up more abundant grasslands and fertile farmland for minority nationality areas. The rich underground mineral resources in minority nationality areas will also gradually gain the conditions for development. The security of our border areas will be guaranteed by a modern and consolidated national defense, and the people of all nationalities will be able to live and work in peace and contentment.

    It should be made clear to the people of all nationalities that this is an extremely great and magnificent cause, but it is also an extremely arduous and complex cause. It cannot be completed in a day or two, but requires a long-term struggle. Therefore, we must proceed from the current situation and move step by step, and cannot plan to achieve it all at once. At present, minority nationality areas should still focus on developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. The Party and the People's Government will further help farmers of all nationalities improve production tools, improve agricultural production technology, and build water conservancy projects to increase output and improve the lives of farmers of all nationalities. In pastoral areas (minority nationality pastoral areas account for more than 90% of the country's pastoral areas), we will continue to adhere to the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry production, including the economy of herdowners, implement the policies of "no struggle, no division, no class division" and "both herdsmen and herdowners benefit," and help herdsmen improve livestock breeding methods, improve livestock breeds, prevent and control animal epidemics, and protect and cultivate grasslands. As for industrial construction in minority nationality areas, it should be considered from the perspective of the overall national construction and carried out gradually with emphasis based on the strength of the country and the unified plan and steps, as well as the resource distribution and transportation of various actual situations in minority nationality areas, according to needs and possibilities. Some of the key projects of industrial capital construction in our country's first five-year plan are located in minority nationality areas. In some minority nationality areas where conditions already exist, we will build some light industrial factories and local and special product processing factories that are necessary for the people of all nationalities to improve their lives and have greater development prospects as much as possible, and run some local industries and handicrafts as much as possible. After the country's heavy industry has a solid foundation, the speed of development of industrial construction in minority nationality areas will not be very slow but will be quite rapid. Some cadres and people in minority nationality areas do not look at the current situation and conditions and demand that industrial development in minority nationality areas be developed on a large scale immediately, which is unrealistic. We must move forward steadily step by step.

    Without the unity of all nationalities, the development of all construction undertakings in the motherland, including minority nationality areas, is impossible. Therefore, we must tell the people of all nationalities to continue to strengthen national unity. At present, Han chauvinism is the main obstacle to national unity. The Han people, especially Han cadres, must continue to overcome the remnants of Han chauvinism, respect the rights of minority nationalities, and sincerely help minority nationalities develop. It should be recognized that the economic and cultural development of minority nationality areas is closely related to the development of the entire country, and it is also of great benefit to the Han people. The existence of local nationalism in minority nationalities and the existence of great-nation chauvinism in minority nationalities that occupy a majority position in some areas are also harmful to the unity between nationalities and must also be overcome. Disputes within various nationalities were caused by the reactionary ruling class's implementation of a policy of discord in history. The people of all nationalities should proceed from the interests of the entire motherland, resolve them through consultation in the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual concession, and defeat the conspiracies of lurking enemies to sow discord and create disputes within and between minority nationalities. The people of all nationalities, especially leaders who have contact with the people, should be vigilant at all times against the sabotage activities of the remaining enemies.

    In order to do a good job in production and construction and consolidate national unity, the policy of national regional autonomy should be further implemented. The policy of national regional autonomy is the basic policy for solving the nationality problem in our country and is the main key to doing a good job in nationality work. Only by realizing national regional autonomy can we give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all nationalities to be "masters of their own affairs," enhance the patriotic and internationalist concepts of the people of all nationalities, strengthen the unity between nationalities and within nationalities, strengthen the ties between the central government and the border areas, and further incorporate the construction undertakings of various minority nationality areas into the overall track of the country's planned economic construction. In the future, we must follow the "Basic Summary of the Experience of Promoting National Regional Autonomy" of the Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission and let the people of minority nationalities manage their own ethnic affairs themselves. The people of all minority nationalities, as well as leaders who have contact with the people, should also give play to a high degree of enthusiasm and patriotism and, with the help of the Han nationality, build the autonomous region better and strive to enter socialism together with the Han nationality areas in a fairly long period of time.

    It should be clearly told to the people of all nationalities that the political, economic, and cultural development of minority nationality areas, on the one hand, depends on the help of the Han people, and the Han people should also regard helping all minority nationalities as their own obligation. On the other hand, this also requires the people of all minority nationalities to raise their awareness and give full play to their abilities and wisdom in order to gradually realize it. This is inseparable from the internal reforms of all minority nationalities. However, this kind of reform must be decided by the voluntary wishes of the minority nationalities themselves and mainly carried out by themselves, and others have no right to force it. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report to the Third Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Appropriate reforms within various nationalities are a necessary process for the development and progress of various nationalities and their gradual entry into the ranks of advanced nationalities. However, this kind of reform must be suitable for the characteristics of the current stage of development of its own nationality, must be based on the will of the majority of the people of its own nationality, and must take appropriate steps to rely on its own ethnic cadres to carry it out." At the same time, we should recognize that because the historical development of various nationalities is different, the current level of development also varies greatly. Therefore, the steps and methods of transitioning to socialism will also be different. But one thing is common, that is, transitioning to socialism through peaceful means.

    Some people ask, "Socialism is good, but can I enter it?" The answer is affirmative. The Chinese Communist Party will continue to adhere to the policy of long-term unity and long-term cooperation with patriotic democratic figures and leaders of all nationalities and religions. All leaders of all nationalities and religions who have contact with the masses of the people have made beneficial contributions in stabilizing social order, restoring and developing the economic and cultural undertakings of various minority nationalities, and enhancing the unity of the people of all nationalities in the past four years, and have learned a lot and made great progress; in the future, they should actively learn and strive for progress, and strive to make more and greater contributions in the realization of the various tasks during the transition period of the country. In the future, as long as they are people who approve of socialism, they can enter socialism. As early as June 1950, Chairman Mao said: "As long as someone is willing to truly serve the people, and has indeed helped and done good deeds during the period when the people are still in difficulty, and continues to do so consistently, and does not give up halfway, then the people and the people's government have no reason to reject him, and have no reason not to give him the opportunity to live and the opportunity to serve." (Concluding Remarks at the Second Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)

    Some people also doubt: "Will there still be freedom of religious belief after socialism? Will the unique customs and habits of the ethnic group still be maintained?" This kind of doubt is also unnecessary. Chairman Mao once clearly pointed out: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and those who believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion, those who believe in this religion and those who believe in other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will still adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." (Talk with members of the Tibetan Tribute Delegation) The Soviet people still have freedom of religious belief now, which is the best explanation. Similarly, the customs and habits of minority nationalities will still be respected at that time. The reform or non-reform of customs and habits is decided by the ethnic group itself, and others have no right to interfere and will not interfere.

    There are dozens of minority nationalities in our country, and the political, economic, and cultural development of each minority nationality and even the same nationality living in different regions is also unbalanced. The current work guidelines and tasks are also different, and the content and methods of propaganda cannot but be different. We cannot simply transplant the content and methods of propaganda in Han areas to minority areas, nor can we transplant the content and methods of propaganda in one minority area to another minority area with different circumstances. Propaganda must be adapted to the specific circumstances of the current development of each nationality, and must be closely integrated with the local work tasks. If this is not the case, but rather a generalized propaganda of the general line, mistakes will inevitably be made, even serious mistakes.

    The road indicated by the Chinese Communist Party for the people of all nationalities in our country to gradually transition to socialism is a road of infinite light and great distance. The facts of the Soviet Union have clearly indicated this prospect. At the beginning of the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the nationalities in the eastern and northern border regions of Russia were also very undeveloped. Many nationalities not only did not have their own industries and their own intellectual cadres, but even did not have their own national scripts. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, with the help of the advanced Russian nationality, these backward nationalities directly entered the socialist economy from a primitive economy. Over the past 30 years, the economic and cultural construction undertakings of the Soviet national republics have developed rapidly. The development of industry, especially large-scale industry, in the eastern Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan is even faster than the average rate of industrial development in the entire Soviet Union. The output of large-scale industry in these republics increased 22 times from 1928 to 1951. In the same period, the entire Soviet Union only increased 16 times. By the eve of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1952, in the fields of collective farms and state-owned farms in these republics, there were 121,000 tractors (with 15 horsepower as a unit), 23,000 combine harvesters, 102,000 machines for sowing, cultivating, and picking cotton, and hundreds of thousands of other types of agricultural machines and tools. In this way, there are no longer any backward nationalities in the Soviet Union. In the years of socialist construction, all nationalities have developed into advanced socialist nationalities.

    It should be told to the people of all minority nationalities in our country: The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class, which base their nationalities policy on the Leninist-Stalinist theory of the nationalities question, will also, like the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet working class, resolutely lead the people of all minority nationalities in our country and the Han nationality into socialism and jointly enjoy the happy life of socialism in the future.

    The Marxist-Leninist theory of nationalities and the nationality policy of Comrade Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party illuminate the road forward for the people of all our nationalities. Let the people of all nationalities unite, actively participate in and vigorously support the great cause of national socialist industrialization, and strive to realize the Party's general tasks on the nationality issue during the transition period.

    怎样宣传过渡时期党在民族问题方面的任务
    在我们国家逐步地向社会主义过渡的时期中，党在民族问题方面的总任务是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利方面的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。向少数民族人民深入普遍地宣传这个总任务，号召大家和组织大家为这个总任务的实现而奋斗，这就是在少数民族地区宣传国家过渡时期总路线时的具体要求。
    在向少数民族宣传国家过渡时期总路线和党在民族问题方面的任务时，首先必须告诉我国各少数民族的人民，从中华人民共和国成立起，我国就开始了一个新的时期，这就是逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期。四年多来，我国各民族人民，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，已经实现了国家的完全独立和统一，各民族人民都紧密地团结在自由、平等的大家庭里。工人阶级领导的人民民主政权已经大大巩固，由于经济恢复工作的胜利，我国工农业的生产力有了很大提高，工农业主要产品已经超过了中国历史上最高年产量，人民生活已普遍地得到初步改善。我国在一九五三年已经开始了有计划的经济建设。在过渡时期总路线的照耀下，我国将由一个工业不发达的国家变成一个工业很发达的社会主义国家。
    应当使各族人民了解，四年多来的民族工作，已获得了重大的成就。经过四年多的努力，现在各民族之间和各民族内部已经越来越团结了，各少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化教育事业正迅速发展着。无论农业区或牧业区，城市和乡村，都在发生着巨大的变化。到一九五三年，全国已经建立了四十八个县级以上的民族自治区，少数民族获得了“当家作主”的权利。国营贸易机构已经深入到偏远的少数民族地区和游牧区，用合理的价格供应各族人民生产工具和生活用品，收购土产特产，逐步改善着少数民族人民的生活。各民族地区的县都建立了卫生机构，并有医疗队巡回各地，为各族人民免费治病。少数民族的人口已在逐渐增加。将近少数民族人口总数三分之二的农业区已经实行了土地改革，一部分牧业区已经根据当地民族的自愿进行了必要的民主改革。人民政府用发放农具、贷款、兴修水利和防治兽疫、保护牧场、改良品种等方法，帮助各族人民发展了农业和畜牧业生产。少数民族地区的交通状况也在不断改善。一九五三年公路建设以少数民族地区为重点，投资总数约等于过去三年投资的总和。一部分少数民族地区如内蒙古和新疆已经有了现代化的工业。一九五二年底，全国已有民族小学九千一百多所，兼收各族子弟的小学四千八百六十多所，少数民族的干部在全国已有十万人左右。
    但是这还只是一件伟大事业的开端。今后随着国家社会主义工业化的逐步进展，少数民族地区的建设事业也将继续逐步进展。这就是说：我们国家将逐步地建立更多的工厂，制造更多的各种各样的新式机器、农具和物美价廉的日用品，把更多的公路、铁路修到偏远的少数民族地区去，以便运进更多的工业品和运出土特产品特别是畜牧业与副业的产品。少数民族牧民们割草、挤奶、剪羊毛、灭狼、保畜所用的落后工具，将逐渐为进步的工具所代替。人和牲畜所需要的医药和医务人员也将逐步充足起来，增加人的健康和减少牲畜的死亡，并逐步改善牲畜饲养方法，使牲畜养得更好、繁殖得更多。牧民所生产的羊毛、牛皮、牛奶、肠衣等畜产品和其他土、特产品，将经过工厂的加工变为更适用的生活资料，以增加人民收入，改善人民生活。工业发展了，少数民族农民使用的木制农具和“刀耕火种”的落后耕作方法，也将逐渐被新式农具所代替。而且有条件兴修更多更大的水利，大量制造化学肥料，为少数民族地区开辟更多丰盛的草原和肥沃的良田。少数民族地区丰富的地下矿藏也将逐渐获得开发的条件。我们边疆地区的安全，将有现代化的巩固的国防来保障，各族人民将更能安居乐业。
    应当使各族人民明白：这是一个极其伟大壮丽的事业，但同时也是一个极其艰巨复杂的事业。它不是一朝一夕可以完成，而是要经过长期的奋斗过程的。因此，我们必须从现状出发，一步一步地走，而不能打算一下子就达到。目前，少数民族地区仍应着重发展农业和畜牧业生产。党和人民政府将进一步帮助各族农民改进生产工具，提高农业生产技术，兴修水利，以提高产量，改善各族农民的生活。在牧业区（少数民族牧业区占全国牧业区百分之九十以上）仍将继续坚持保护与发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业生产的方针，贯彻“不斗、不分、不划阶级”与“牧工、牧主两利”的政策，并帮助牧民改善牲畜饲养方法，改良牲畜品种，防治兽疫，保护和培育草原。至于少数民族地区的工业建设，则要从整个国家建设着眼，依据国家的力量和统一的计划、步骤，以及少数民族地区的资源分布、交通运输等各种实际情况，按照需要与可能，有重点地逐步进行。我国第一个五年计划中工业基本建设的重点工程，有的就是在少数民族地区。在一些已有条件的少数民族地区，则将尽可能建设某些为各族人民改善生活所必需的和发展前途较大的轻工业工厂和土、特产加工工厂，尽可能兴办一些地方工业和手工业。到国家重工业有了坚实的基础以后，少数民族地区工业建设的发展的速度将不会是很慢而会是相当迅速的。有些少数民族地区的干部和人民不看今天的情况和条件，要求现在马上就大规模发展少数民族地区的工业，这是不现实的。我们必须一步一步的稳步前进。
    没有各民族的团结，包括少数民族地区在内的祖国一切建设事业的发展是不可能的。因此，我们必须告诉各族人民要继续加强民族团结。在目前，大汉族主义是民族团结的主要障碍，汉族人民特别是汉族干部必须继续克服大汉族主义的残余思想，尊重少数民族的权利，诚心诚意帮助少数民族发展。应该认识，少数民族地区经济文化的发展，对于整个国家的发展是有很密切关系的，对于汉族人民同样也是有很大好处的。少数民族中的地方民族主义，以及在某些地区占多数地位的少数民族中的大民族主义的存在，对民族间的团结也是有害的，也必须注意克服。各民族内部的纠纷是历史上反动统治阶级实行挑拨离间政策所造成的，各族人民应该从整个祖国的利益出发，本着互助互让的精神，协商解决，击破潜伏的敌人在少数民族内部和相互间进行挑拨离间、制造纷争的阴谋。各族人民，特别是与人民有联系的领袖人物，应该随时警惕残余敌人的破坏活动。
    为了作好生产和建设工作，巩固民族的团结，应该进一步贯彻民族区域自治政策。民族区域自治政策是解决我国民族问题的基本政策，是做好民族工作的主要关键。实现了民族区域自治，才能发挥各族人民“当家作主”的积极性和自动精神，增强各族人民的爱国主义和国际主义观念，加强民族间和民族内部的团结，加强中央与边疆的联系，并将各少数民族地区的建设事业进一步纳入国家有计划的经济建设的总轨道。今后我们必须按照“中央民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结”，让少数民族人民自己管理本民族的事务。各少数民族人民以及与人民有联系的领袖人物，也应该发挥高度的积极性和爱国主义精神，在汉族的帮助下，把自治区建设得更好，争取和汉族地区一道在一个相当长的时期内共同进入社会主义。
    应当明确地告诉各民族人民：少数民族地区政治、经济和文化的发展，一方面有赖于汉族人民的帮助，汉族人民也应当把帮助各少数民族当作自己的义务。另一方面，这也需要各少数民族人民提高觉悟，并把自己的能力和智慧充分发挥起来，才能逐步实现。这和各少数民族内部的改革是分不开的。但是，这种改革，必须由少数民族自己的志愿决定，并主要由他们自己去进行，别人是无权强迫的。周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上所作的报告中曾指示：“各民族内部的适当改革，是各民族发展进步、逐渐跻于先进民族水平所必须经历的过程。但这种改革必须适合其本民族当前发展阶段的特点，必须根据其本民族大多数人民的意志，并采取妥善步骤，依靠其本民族干部去进行。”同时我们应该认识：由于各民族的历史发展不同，目前的发展水平也有很大差异，因此，过渡到社会主义的步骤和方式也将有不同。但有一点是共同的，这就是经过和平的道路向社会主义过渡。
    有人问：“社会主义好是好，但是我能进去吗？”回答是肯定的。中国共产党对于各民族、各教派中爱国民主人士及领袖人物将继续坚持长期团结、长期合作的方针。一切与人民群众有联系的各民族、各教派中的领袖人物，在过去四年中，在安定社会秩序、恢复与发展各少数民族的经济和文化事业、增进各族人民团结方面，都作了有益的贡献，并学到不少东西，获得很大进步；今后应该积极学习，力求进步，争取在实现国家过渡时期的各项任务中，能有更多更大的贡献。到将来，只要是赞成社会主义的人，都可以进入社会主义。毛主席早在一九五○年六月就说过：“只要谁肯真正为人民效力，在人民还有困难的时期内确实帮了忙，做了好事，并且是一贯地做下去，并不半途而废，那末，人民和人民的政府是没有理由不要他的，是没有理由不给他以生活的机会和效力的机会的。”（中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕辞）
    还有人怀疑：“到了社会主义以后，宗教信仰是不是还有自由呢？民族特有的风俗习惯是不是还能保持呢？”这种怀疑也是没有必要的。毛主席曾经明确指出：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的和信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”（和西藏致敬团人员的谈话）苏联人民现在仍然有信教的自由，就是最好的说明。同样，少数民族的风俗习惯，到那时也仍会受到尊重。风俗习惯的改革或不改革，都由本民族自己来决定，别人是无权干涉，也不会干涉的。
    我国少数民族有几十个，各个少数民族之间以至居住在不同地区的同一民族之间，政治、经济和文化的发展又都是不平衡的。目前的工作方针和任务也各不相同，宣传的内容和方式、方法也就不能不有所区别。既不能把在汉族地区宣传的内容和方式方法搬用到少数民族地区去，也不能把这一少数民族地区的宣传内容和方式方法搬用到情况不同的另一少数民族地区去。宣传要适合各该民族目前发展的具体情况，要密切结合当地的工作任务进行。倘若不是这样，而是一般化的宣传总路线，就必然会犯错误，直至严重的错误。
    中国共产党指示我国各民族人民逐步过渡到社会主义的道路是一条无限光明远大的道路。苏联的事实已经把这种前途鲜明地指示出来了。苏联在十月革命胜利之初，俄国东部和北部边疆各民族也是很不发展的，许多民族不但没有自己的工业和自己的知识分子干部，甚至没有自己的民族文字。苏维埃政权建立以后，经过先进俄罗斯民族的帮助，这些落后民族从原始的经济直接进入社会主义的经济。三十年来，苏联各民族共和国的经济、文化建设事业飞速地发展着。东部的乌兹别克、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼和塔吉克等苏维埃共和国的工业特别是大规模工业的发展，比全苏联工业发展的平均速度还要快。这些共和国的大规模工业的产量，从一九二八年到一九五一年增加到二十二倍。而在同一时期整个苏联只增加到十六倍。到一九五二年联共（布）第十九次代表大会召开前夕，在这些共和国的集体农场和国营农场的田野上，有着十二万一千台拖拉机（以十五马力为单位）、两万三千台联合收割机、十万二千台播种、培育和采棉花的机器和几十万台其他种类的农业机器和工具。这样，苏联就不再有什么落后民族了。各民族已经在社会主义建设的年代里，统统发展为先进的社会主义的民族了。
    应当告诉我国各个少数民族的人民：苏联的今天就是我们的明天。以列宁、斯大林关于民族问题的学说作为自己民族政策基础的中国共产党和中国工人阶级，也将像苏联共产党和苏联工人阶级一样，坚决领导我国各少数民族人民和汉族一道进入社会主义，共同在将来享受社会主义的幸福生活。
    马克思列宁主义的民族学说和中国共产党毛泽东同志的民族政策，照耀着我们各民族人民前进的道路。各民族人民团结起来，积极参加和努力支援国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业，为实现过渡时期党在民族问题方面的总任务而奋斗。
