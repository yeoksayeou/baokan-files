Consolidating and Improving Agricultural Production Cooperatives During Spring Plowing: Inspection of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work in the Northeast Region

[This Newspaper Despatch] The Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held a mutual aid and cooperation report meeting at the end of March to review the recent development of agricultural production cooperatives, focusing on how to further consolidate and improve existing agricultural production cooperatives during spring plowing.

From August of last year to mid-March of this year, the Northeast region, with the exception of a few areas, generally began establishing agricultural production cooperatives. During this period, 12,243 new agricultural production cooperatives were established, equivalent to 2.4 times the number of cooperatives existing last year. This includes 521 vegetable, fruit tree, livestock, ginseng, and fishing production cooperatives. Among them, 45 cooperatives were upgraded from the original cooperatives to agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature; 72 cooperatives were directly developed into agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, adding to the original 10, for a total of 127 completely socialist agricultural production cooperatives. The number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 4.56 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the region. These cooperatives are distributed in 36.4 percent of the villages in the region, among which 289 villages have more than 50 percent of the total number of farming households participating in cooperatives.

According to reports from various localities, the newly established agricultural production cooperatives are basically successful. However, the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has brought many new situations and new problems. How to further consolidate and improve the existing agricultural production cooperatives has become the most important task at present. The meeting concluded that the key to consolidation and improvement lies in guaranteeing increased production through improved technology, as well as improving business management and ideological education. For older cooperatives, especially some older cooperatives with a good foundation, large scale, and long history, attention must be paid to conditionally expanding the scope of operations and further improving farming techniques; according to the development of production and the level of awareness of the members, appropriately expand public accumulation to better exert the potential of production. New cooperatives generally have high enthusiasm for production, but lack experience in rationally organizing labor and managing operations. About 10 percent of the cooperatives have some problems left over due to the relatively rough work of establishing the cooperatives. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the time before the busy spring plowing season to effectively solve the problems that still exist and quickly switch to production. County and district leaders should plan and adopt various practical and effective methods to organize new and old cooperatives to exchange experiences, and use the old cooperatives to drive the new cooperatives. An active attitude should be taken towards agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously organized by farmers to rectify and lead them. All those who have the conditions to do well should be approved; those who are indeed not qualified should be persuaded and educated with enthusiasm and patience, reorganized into year-round mutual aid teams, and helped to create conditions.

The meeting also reviewed the work of mutual aid teams. Some county and district cadres did not have a deep understanding of the policy of comprehensively developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Some only cared about building cooperatives and did not lead mutual aid teams; some drew out the backbone of the mutual aid teams to build cooperatives, regardless of the consequences, resulting in a tendency of "building cooperatives and collapsing teams"; others mechanically followed the plan, ignoring the people's requirements for building cooperatives, and were divorced from the actual situation. In response to these situations, the meeting held that leadership over mutual aid teams should be strengthened. County and district leaders should plan to rectify mutual aid teams by season and in stages, train key members, and grasp the central link of consolidation and improvement that combines technical guidance, the principle of mutual benefit, and ideological education. In addition, the meeting believes that supply and marketing and credit cooperation should be strengthened so that they can keep up with the development of production and mutual aid and cooperation.

The meeting emphasized that the fundamental purpose of developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations is to improve productivity and increase production. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose any phenomenon of grasping mutual aid and cooperation in isolation and neglecting to lead technical increase in production. It is necessary to quickly guide the current high socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to do a good job in spring plowing and production, and ensure the completion of the state's task of increasing grain, industrial raw materials, and non-staple food.

   在春耕生产中巩固和提高农业生产合作社
   东北区检查互助合作工作
   【本报讯】中共中央东北局农村工作部，在三月底召开互助合作汇报会，检查了农业生产合作社最近发展的情况，着重研究了怎样使现有农业生产合作社在春耕生产中进一步巩固和提高的问题。
    东北区从去年八月到今年三月中旬为止，除少数地区以外，一般都开始了建立农业生产合作社的工作。在这个期间内，新建立了一万二千二百四十三个农业生产合作社，等于去年原有社的二点四倍。其中包括蔬菜、果树、牧畜、人参、渔业生产合作社五百二十一个。其中由原来的合作社提升为完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社四十五个；直接发展成完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社七十二个，加上原有的十个，共有一百二十七个完全社会主义性质的合作社。参加农业生产合作社的户数，占全区农业户数百分之四点五六。这些合作社分布于全区百分之三十六点四的村子里，其中有二百八十九个村，每个村参加合作社的户数超过该村总农户百分之五十。
    根据各地汇报，新建立的农业生产合作社基本上是成功的。但是由于互助合作运动的迅速发展，带来不少新情况和新问题，如何使现有的农业生产合作社进一步巩固和提高，就成为目前最主要的任务。会议研究结果，认为：巩固和提高的关键在于从改进技术来保证增产，并搞好经营管理和思想教育。对老社特别是一部分基础较好、规模较大、历史较久的老社，必须注意有条件地扩大经营范围，进一步提高农作技术；根据生产发展情形和社员觉悟程度，适当扩大公共积累，更好地发挥生产潜在力。新社一般生产情绪都很高，但缺乏合理地组织劳动力和经营管理的经验，约有百分之十的社因建社工作比较粗糙，尚遗留一些问题。因此，必须抓紧春耕大忙以前的时间，切实解决现在还存在的问题，迅速转入生产。县、区领导应当有计划地采取各种切实可行的有效办法，组织新、老社交流经验，用老社带动新社。对那些农民自发组织的农业生产合作社，应当采取积极的态度进行整顿和领导，凡有条件办好的都应当批准；对确实不够条件的，应热情耐心地进行说服教育，改组为常年互助组，并帮助创造条件。
    会议同时检查了互助组的工作。部分县、区干部因为对全面发展互助合作运动的政策体会不深，有的只管建社，不领导互助组；有的把互助组的骨干抽出来建社，不顾后果，造成“建社垮组”的偏向；也有的机械地按计划办事，无视群众建社的要求，脱离了实际情况。针对这些情况，会议认为，应加强对互助组的领导。县、区领导应有计划地按季分段整顿互助组、训练骨干分子，抓住技术指导、互利原则和思想教育相结合的巩固与提高的中心环节。此外，会议认为应加强供销、信用合作工作，使之能够跟上生产和互助合作的发展。
    会议强调指出：发展互助合作组织的根本目的是为了提高生产力，增加生产。因此，反对任何孤立抓互助合作而忽视领导技术增产的现象，必须把广大农民当前高涨的社会主义热情，迅速引导搞好春耕生产，保证完成国家增产粮食与工业原料、副食品的任务。
