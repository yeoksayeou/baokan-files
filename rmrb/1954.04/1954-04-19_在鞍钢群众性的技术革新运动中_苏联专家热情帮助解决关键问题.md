Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 18th: Soviet experts have played a significant role in the technical innovation movement carried out in various plants and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Works. In the past four years, experts have put forward more than 10,000 suggestions to production and basic construction departments, solving many key problems that had not been resolved for a long time.

As early as 1950, Soviet expert Popov helped the Iron Smelting Plant successfully trial the use of sintered ore to smelt low-silicon iron. The success of this technical innovation solved many problems that "experts" from capitalist countries believed were impossible to solve. During the Japanese occupation of Anshan Iron and Steel, special personnel were sent to countries such as England, the United States, and Germany to study the ore, and even an American expert was invited to Anshan for on-site observation. All these attempts failed, and the "expert" concluded that "Anshan raw materials are not suitable for sintering." Shortly after the liberation of Northeast China, Soviet expert Popov came to Anshan and enthusiastically proposed the extensive use of sintered ore. Anshan Iron and Steel Company actively supported the Soviet expert's suggestion and decided to first experiment with it on a blast furnace operated by Zhou Chuandian in the Iron Smelting Plant. Through the joint efforts of Zhou Chuandian and the blast furnace workers, the suggestion of using sintered ore in the blast furnace was finally realized. In a short period, all the blast furnaces in the Iron Smelting Plant used sintered ore for iron smelting, with a usage rate of 90 percent, greatly increasing the output of pig iron and reducing costs by 50 percent. Subsequently, Popov guided the Iron Smelting Plant to successfully smelt low-silicon iron. The smelting of low-silicon iron in blast furnaces was another problem that the Japanese had been unable to solve for a long time. After Popov conducted specific research and analysis of various factors such as the blast furnace and ore, he proposed using acidic slag to smelt low-silicon iron. Through experiments by Zhou Chuandian and the blast furnace workers, the experiment of smelting low-silicon iron was also successful.

The successful smelting of low-silicon iron in blast furnaces created conditions for the direct transfer of steelmaking pig iron from the blast furnaces to the open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking. Therefore, the preliminary refining furnaces set up by the Steelmaking Plant for desiliconization were to be idled. At this time, with the help of experts such as Makarov and Bliznyukov, the Steelmaking Plant began the project of converting the preliminary refining furnaces into steelmaking open-hearth furnaces. This transformation enabled the Steelmaking Plant to expand its steelmaking equipment with very little investment. In addition, with the help of Soviet experts Masherov, Gilingif, and Nie Noroschev, the employees of the Steelmaking Plant successfully transformed the cold-setting furnace bottom into a sintered furnace bottom, which not only ensured the quality of the furnace bottom and extended its lifespan but also greatly increased steel production. Soviet expert Gilenchev, who was helping at the Ore Dressing Plant, guided the employees to successfully replace anthracite coal with coke powder as fuel for sintering, increasing output by two-thirds and increasing the nation's wealth by more than 70 billion yuan a year. After Makarov helped the initial rolling mill improve the burners of the recuperative soaking furnace, the speed of heating steel increased by 36.5 percent. At the Chemical Complex, based on the suggestion of Soviet expert Beresky, employees improved the production of crude benzene, increasing the recovery rate of crude benzene by more than 50 percent.

In the mass technical innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, Soviet experts paid great attention to the new creations of the vast number of employees and tried to provide assistance in all aspects. For example, when Zhang Mingshan created the "anti-surrounding disc," the problem of how the steel could stand up when entering the inlet guide plate could not be solved, which troubled Zhang Mingshan for many days. Later, Zhang Mingshan remembered the experience of Soviet expert Bestrov, who suggested adding baffles in the steel running trough between the rough rolling and bright rolling mills. This inspiration enabled Zhang Mingshan to finally complete the creation of the "anti-surrounding disc." After the "anti-surrounding disc" experiment was successful, the outlet pipe often had problems, and the rolled steel bars also had streaks. After research by Soviet experts, the outlet pipe was changed to a twisted one, and the steel bar would no longer push the pipe away, and the steel bar passed through the pipe obediently. Then, the experts widened the ellipse of the outlet pipe nozzle and replaced the iron pipe with a steel pipe, so the rolled steel bar was smooth, without any streaks. Tang Fulin, assistant engineer of the First Thin Plate Plant, received great help from Soviet experts when he created the double lifting platform of the rolling mill. Expert Zhdanovsky lent him Soviet books, enabling him to first create an automatic coupler. Expert Kratkov proposed a method of neatly merging two iron plates together for rolling, which not only ensured quality but also increased output. Expert Radimov helped him finalize the drawing of the double lifting platform. Now, the double lifting platform is being tested with the help of Soviet experts. The success of this creation is a very significant innovation for the production of the First Thin Plate Plant.

    在鞍钢群众性的技术革新运动中
    苏联专家热情帮助解决关键问题
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】苏联专家在鞍钢各厂矿开展的技术革新运动中起了很大作用。四年来，专家们向生产和基本建设部门提出的建议有一万多项，解决了许多长期没有解决的关键问题。
    早在一九五零年，苏联专家波波夫就帮助炼铁厂试用烧结矿冶炼低矽铁成功。这一技术革新的成功，解决了许多资本主义国家的“专家”认为无法解决的问题。日本统治鞍钢时期，曾经派专人拿着矿石到英、美、德等资本主义国家研究，并且还请了一位美国专家来鞍山实地观察，结果都失败了，这位“专家”认为“鞍山原料不适宜做烧结”。东北解放后不久，苏联专家波波夫来到鞍山，就热情地提出大量使用烧结矿的建议。鞍山钢铁公司积极支持苏联专家的建议，并确定首先在炼铁厂周传典所在的某号高炉上试验。经过周传典和高炉工人的共同努力，高炉使用烧结矿的建议终于实现。在很短的时间内，炼铁厂的各个高炉都使用烧结矿炼铁，使用率达到百分之九十，生铁的产量大增，成本降低了百分之五十。接着，波波夫又指导炼铁厂炼制低矽铁成功。高炉冶炼低矽铁，也是日本人长期无法解决的问题。波波夫具体研究分析了高炉、矿石等各种情况后，提出了用酸性渣炼低矽铁的建议，经过周传典和高炉工人的试验，炼低矽铁又试验成功了。
    高炉炼低矽铁成功后，为高炉的炼钢生铁直接送到平炉炼钢创造了条件。因此，炼钢厂为了脱矽所设的预备精炼炉就要闲置起来。这时，在马卡洛夫和布利兹纽阔夫等专家的帮助下，炼钢厂又开始了改预备精炼炉为炼钢平炉的工程。这一工程的改造，使炼钢厂增加很少的投资就扩大了炼钢的设备。此外，在苏联专家马雪洛夫、吉林吉夫、聂挪司切也夫的帮助下，炼钢厂的职工改造冷打炉底为烧结炉底成功，这不但保证了炉底的质量，延长了炉底的寿命，而且大大增加了钢的产量。在选矿厂帮助工作的苏联专家吉连切耶夫，指导职工用焦粉代替无烟煤作为烧结的燃料成功，使产量提高了三分之二，一年可为国家增产七百多亿元的财富。马卡洛夫帮助初轧厂改进复座均热炉的烧嘴后，使烧钢的速度提高了百分之三十六点五。在化工总厂，职工们根据苏联专家别列斯基的建议，改进了粗苯的生产，使粗苯的回收率提高百分之五十以上。
    在鞍钢群众性的技术革新运动中，苏联专家们十分关怀广大职工的新创造，并设法给予各方面的帮助。例如张明山创造“反围盘”时，钢材怎样在进入口导板时能立得起来这一问题无法解决，这使张明山苦恼了好多天。后来，张明山想起苏联专家贝斯脱罗夫提出的在毛轧和光轧之间的跑钢槽里加挡板的经验，这一启发使张明山最后完成了“反围盘”的创造。“反围盘”试验成功后，出孔管子时常出毛病，轧出来的钢条还有一道一道的纹。经过苏联专家研究，把出孔管子改成拧劲的，钢条再也不会把管子顶跑，钢条在管子里服服贴贴地过去了。接着专家又把出孔管子嘴的椭圆再放宽一些，铁管换成钢管，这样轧出来的钢条就光溜溜的，一道纹也没有了。第一薄板厂助理工程师汤富麟在创制轧钢机的双重升降台时，苏联专家给了他很大的帮助。专家日丹诺夫斯基把苏联的书籍借给他看，使他首先创造了自动联合器。专家克拉特柯夫提出把两块铁板整齐地合并起来轧制的办法，既保证了质量，又提高了产量。专家拉地莫夫帮助他把双重升降台的图样最后肯定下来。现在，双重升降台正在苏联专家帮助下进行试验。这一创造成功后，对于第一薄板厂的生产是一项非常重大的革新。
