Reader's Letters Abstract

    Strengthen Education for Loading and Unloading Workers
    (I)
    Zhang Weixiang from the Construction Materials Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry writes: In late December of last year, the exploration team under our bureau entrusted the railway department to transport 464 pieces of drilling tools, including core tubes, casings, core pipes, and drill rods, from Shenyang to Shuangqiao Station on the Jing-Tong Railway Line. When our personnel went to pick up the goods, they discovered that 189 of these pipes had damaged screw threads at both ends. If these damaged pipe mouths were repaired, the cost would be approximately 16 million yuan. According to our inquiries with the loading and unloading workers at the station, the damage to the pipes was caused by the loading and unloading workers throwing the pipes off the train during unloading. Fortunately, these pipes were not being transported to the construction site for drilling; otherwise, it would have delayed resource exploration work and caused incalculable losses to the project. Therefore, we suggest that the railway department strengthen education for loading and unloading workers and formulate operating procedures for loading and unloading various goods. Items that should be lifted and placed gently should not be thrown, so that every worker can ideologically and actively implement the concept of cherishing state property.
    (II)
    Wang Guangju from the Yongnian County Cooperative Union of Hebei Province writes: In February of this year, our cooperative transported dozens of truckloads of timber from the south to Linmingguan Station on the Jinghan Railway Line. Due to the arbitrary throwing of timber during unloading, some timber was broken into several sections, and many good materials were turned into scraps. Similar incidents have frequently occurred at Linmingguan Station in the past. I have made several suggestions, but the station is unwilling to accept them, and instead says, "If the station unloads the timber, it will have to be damaged; otherwise, the cargo owner should unload it themselves."
    I believe that Linmingguan Station should educate loading and unloading workers on cherishing state property and actively seek ways to improve their work to prevent further losses to state property.

### 加强对装卸工人的教育

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强对装卸工人的教育
    （一）
    中央重工业部建筑材料工业管理局张维相来信：去年十二月下旬，我局所属勘察队委托铁路部门把曲分管、套管、岩心管、钻杆等钻探工具四百六十四件由沈阳运至京通线双桥站。在我处派员提货时，发现这批管子两端螺丝口处遭损坏的竟有一百八十九根，如果把这些被碰坏的管子口修理好，费用约需一千六百余万元。据我处向该站装卸工人了解，管子所以遭受损坏，是由于装卸工人在卸车时把管子向车下乱掷所致。幸而这批管子还不是运往工地进行钻探的，否则就会耽误资源勘察工作，造成工程上无法计算的损失。因此，建议铁路部门加强对装卸工人的教育，并制订装卸各种货物的操作规程，应该轻抬轻放的就不能投掷，使每一个工人都能从思想上和行动上贯彻爱护国家财产的观念。
    （二）
    河北省永年县合作社联合社王广居来信：今年二月间，我社由南方运数十车木材至京汉线临洺关车站。由于卸车时大批木材被任意乱掷，有的木材就被摔成几段，很多好料变成残料。以前临洺关车站也经常发生这样的事件。我曾提过好几次建议，该站不愿接受，反而说“要车站卸车就得摔坏木头；不然，就由货主自行卸车”。
    我认为，临洺关车站应该对装卸工人进行爱护国家财产的教育，并积极设法改进工作，以免使国家财产继续遭受损失。
