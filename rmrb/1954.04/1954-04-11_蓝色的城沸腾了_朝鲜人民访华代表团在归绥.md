    Blue City Boils Over
    —Korean People's Delegation Visits Gui Sui
    Jin Feng
    "Where the water and grass are lush, there are many birds; in a kind family, there are many friends."
    —Mongolian Proverb
    (I)
    At four o'clock in the morning, the Big Dipper is still twinkling in the sky, the sheep on the vast grasslands are still quietly huddled together, the newborn babies in the yurts are sound asleep, and the hardworking housewives have not yet gotten up to milk the cows. Gui Sui, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, known as the Blue City (Hohhot) in Mongolian, is already awake and bustling. Loudspeakers are blaring everywhere: "Fellow villagers, get up quickly and prepare to go to the meeting." The sound echoes between the vast new and old cities. By eight o'clock, a quarter of the city's residents—Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu people, workers, students, farmers, herdsmen, government cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army—totaling 50,000 people, are neatly seated in the newly built stadium, waiting for the envoys of the heroic Korean people. There is a 70-year-old Hui woman, Ma Gui, who, despite having just recovered from an illness, is being supported by her young grandson; there are also Young Pioneers under the age of ten, with wide, expectant eyes; and even Hu Heletai, a model herdsman who has traveled thousands of miles from the Hulunbuir grasslands. They all want to see the "relatives who help us guard the gate."
    The clear sky is dotted with a few white clouds. In the square, as far as the eye can see, there are people dressed in blue and green clothing, looking like a blue and green grassland. The pink, sky-blue, light green, and apricot-yellow silk headscarves worn by women of various ethnic groups and the red scarves of the Young Pioneers are like blooming flowers on the grassland.
    The Korean People's Delegation arrives. As if a warm spring breeze has blown over, the calm grassland suddenly stirs, rising and falling in layers of waves. Fifty thousand people applaud in unison, like spring thunder rolling across the square. When Liu Wanshu, a representative of the delegation and a Hero of the Republic, begins to report on the heroic struggles of the Korean people over the past three years, the square falls silent. Fifty thousand people silently recall those difficult days. The flames of war burned the land of Korea, and they also burned the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. That winter, a blizzard swept across the Mongolian grasslands, and hundreds of Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, and Han youths mounted their war horses and crossed the river to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. The villagers of Jerim League, bordering the Northeast, automatically carried stretchers across the river, even when the snow was knee-deep. More herdsmen busied themselves slaughtering cattle and sheep, carefully making various kinds of meat floss and dried meat to send to the front lines, supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people. When the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued a call: the Korean front needs airplanes and cannons, look, people on the grasslands told each other on horseback. At a "Nadam" conference in the Eastern United Banner of Xilin Gol League, herdsmen led groups of cattle, sheep, camels, and horses, bringing piles of silver dollars and ingots to the donation table. The herdsman Dan Xinzhongnai alone donated two horses, and the old Living Buddha of Halava Temple donated eight thousand silver dollars. At that time, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with a population of only 2.3 million, donated more than 46 billion. At the welcoming rally at the station, Kim Eung-gi, the head of the delegation, spoke with gratitude about this figure and the role it played in the Korean War. The more than 50,000 people in the square, deeply moved by the report of the hero Liu Wanshu, also thought of this figure, but they were thinking: how little we have done compared to the people of this heroic country! At this time, railway worker Liu Guozhu was already pondering: he would propose another rationalization proposal to improve tools in April. Chang Zhengzhong, an apprentice at the wool mill, couldn't help but whisper to Zhang Xiulan and Li Sumei, who were sitting next to him: how to better unite with the masters and learn the skills to complete the production plan ahead of schedule. Zhang Kang, the director of the Mahuaban Xingguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, was planning: to grow more fine grains to sell to the state to support the construction of the Korean people. Gereldulin, a young herdsman who came from Ulanqab League, five hundred miles away, secretly resolved: to run the newly established pastoral mutual aid group well, increase the number of livestock, and provide the Korean people with wool, sheepskin, beef, mutton, milk, dried milk, and milk skin that they need in their daily lives every year....
    When the report ended, the square was like a boiling ocean again, with another thunderous applause, even more powerful than before. Everyone has the same belief, in order to accelerate the construction of the motherland, in order to better support Korea, we must continue to work hard!
    (II)
    This is truly an unusual day. The representatives of the Korean People's Delegation are going to meet with the families of martyrs and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The Mongolian old woman, Huo Suzhen, was particularly excited. She is sixty-three years old this year and has three sons, one who joined the People's Liberation Army and two who joined the Chinese People's Volunteers. Once, in Korea, one of her sons, Han Yulin, was wounded. He wrote a letter to his mother, saying: "Mom, you don't have to worry about me, the Korean fathers and mothers treat me very well, just like at home. After I was wounded, the Korean fathers carried me back, and when we encountered enemy planes bombing, they climbed on top of me to protect me from being bombed. Mom, look how much the Korean fathers care about me!" After receiving this letter, Old Woman Huo Suzhen couldn't sleep for days and nights. The mother's heart worried about her child and was grateful to the Korean villagers who took care of her son as if he were their own! It was too far to go and see them, and she only regretted that her son had not told her their names and addresses, so she couldn't even write a letter. Finally, she heard that the Korean people had sent their representatives to China, to Gui Sui, and that they specifically wanted to meet with the families of martyrs and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The old woman was so happy that she didn't know what to do. She rummaged through the bottom of her chest and found a purple robe with colorful wide edges that she had worn when she was a daughter-in-law and wore it to attend the meeting. The 95-year-old mother of the Hui man, Ma Rui, had a only grandson, Ma Zhimin, who was fighting with the Korean people in Korea. When he heard that the Korean relatives were going to meet with the families of martyrs and soldiers, she couldn't wait to go too; Ma Rui told her that she was too old and couldn't move easily, but promised her that he would definitely say hello to the leaders of the delegation on her behalf, and definitely thank the Korean fathers and mothers who took care of Zhimin on her behalf. Only then did the old woman feel relieved, and now Old Man Ma Rui is also hurrying to come.
    "We have been looking forward to your arrival day and night." At the meeting, the Mongolian old woman, Huo Suzhen, held the hand of Liu Wanshu, a Hero of the Republic, and said gratefully.
    Old Man Ma Rui sat in the meeting with a satisfied expression, listening attentively to the report of Park Chan-soo, a Hero of the Republic. Park Chan-soo said: After the armistice, they and the Chinese People's Volunteers retreated from the military demarcation line to the first line of defense. Their fortifications were next to those of the Chinese People's Volunteers, only fifty meters apart. At night, when patrolling, Park Chan-soo went out with his gun and often walked together with the patrolling Chinese People's Volunteers. "Although everyone speaks different languages," "we pat each other on the shoulder, which means: 'We are always vigilant, guarding our common line of defense, and protecting our common relatives.'" When Old Man Ma Rui heard this, he forgot the customs of his ethnicity and hugged Park Chan-soo tightly, kissing him repeatedly and calling him: "My child." Park Chan-soo looked at the excited old man in front of him and affectionately called him "Old Daddy."
    Old Man Ma Rui remembered his old mother's instructions. He plucked up his courage and walked to the head of the delegation, Kim Eung-gi, and said: "My ninety-five-year-old mother wanted to see you, but she is old and not in good health, so she couldn't come. Let me say hello to you on her behalf, and to all the Korean fathers and mothers. My son is being taken care of by the Korean fathers and mothers in Korea, and I am very grateful." Kim Eung-gi, the head of the delegation, stood up quickly, looked respectfully at the old man with white hair, and said sincerely: "Seeing you today makes me as happy as seeing my own relatives. Thank you for your old mother, and I hope she takes care of her health, lives a long and happy life, and has a happy old age." (Attached picture)

    蓝色的城沸腾了
    ——朝鲜人民访华代表团在归绥
    金凤
    “水草肥美的地方，鸟儿多；善良的人家，朋友多。”  
    ——蒙古谚语
    （一）
    清晨四点钟，北斗星还在天空闪光，大草原的群羊还静悄悄挤在一起，蒙古包中新生的婴儿正在熟睡，勤劳的主妇也还没有起身挤牛奶，蒙古语称为蓝色的城（厚和浩特）的内蒙古自治区首府归绥却已醒来，开始喧闹了。扩音器到处响着：“老乡们快起来，准备开会去。”声音在辽阔的新城和旧城之间回荡着。不到八点钟，全城四分之一的居民——蒙、汉、回、满各族居民、工人、学生、农民、牧民、机关干部和解放军等共五万人，整整齐齐坐在新修的大运动场上，在等待着英雄朝鲜人民的使者。这里有着七十多岁的回族马贵老太太，病刚好搀着她的小孙子赶了来；也有不满十岁的红领巾，睁着滚圆的双眼期待着；更有从数千里外呼伦贝尔草原赶来的牧业劳动模范胡和勒泰，他们都要来看看“帮我们把守大门的亲人”。
    晴朗的天空，飘着几片白云。广场上，一眼望过去，尽是穿着蓝色和绿色服装的人们，简直像一片蓝色和绿色的大草原。各族妇女头上包扎的粉红、天蓝、浅绿、杏黄各色纱绸头巾和少年先锋队的红领巾，正像大草原上盛开的鲜花。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团出现了。仿佛吹过来一阵温暖的春风，平静的草原顿时骚动起来，起伏着层层波浪，五万人一齐鼓起了掌，好像春雷一样在广场上滚过。当代表团代表、共和国英雄柳万洙开始报告三年来朝鲜人民英勇斗争的情形时，广场上一片寂静。五万人默默回想着当时那些严重的日子。战火焚烧着朝鲜的土地，也焚烧着内蒙古各族人民的心。那年冬天，暴风雪刮过蒙古的草原，成百的蒙族、回族、满族、汉族青年跨上战马，过江参加志愿军去了。大雪下得没膝的深，和东北接壤的哲里木盟老乡自动抬起担架过江去了。更多的牧民忙着宰牛杀羊，精心制作各种肉松、肉干送到前线，支援志愿军和朝鲜人民。当抗美援朝总会一声号召：朝鲜前线需要飞机、大炮的时候，看吧，草原上的人们骑马相告。锡林郭勒盟东部联合旗一次“那达慕”大会上，牧民牵着一群群牛、羊、骆驼和马匹，带着一堆堆银元、元宝，奔向捐献台前。牧民丹心忠乃一个人捐了两匹马，哈拉伐庙老布伯活佛捐了八千块银元。当时只有二百三十万人口的内蒙古自治区共捐献了四百六十多亿。代表团团长金应基在车站欢迎大会上曾经带着感激的心情谈到这个数字，谈到这个数字在朝鲜战争中所起的作用。目前广场上的五万多人，当他们被英雄柳万洙的报告所深深感动着时，也想到了这个数字，但他们在想：比起这个英雄国度的人民来，自己做得多么少啊！铁路工人刘国柱这时已经在捉摸着：在四月份要再提出一件改进工具的合理化建议。毛织厂的徒工常正中忍不住和坐在身旁的张秀兰、李素梅低低商量：怎样才能更好团结师傅，学好技术来提前完成生产计划。麻花板星光农业生产合作社主任张康在打算着：要多种些细粮卖给国家来支援朝鲜人民的建设。远从五百里外的乌兰察布盟来的青年牧民格尔都林暗暗下了决心：要把才成立的牧业互助组搞好，牲畜增多，每年给朝鲜人民支援些生活上需用的羊毛、羊皮、牛肉、羊肉、牛乳、奶干、奶皮……。
    报告结束了，广场又像沸腾了的海洋，又是一阵春雷样的掌声，比先前响得更有力了。每一个人都有一个同样的信念，为了加速祖国的建设，为了更好的支援朝鲜，还要继续努力啊！
    （二）
    这真是一个不寻常的日子。朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表要和志愿军烈属、军属会面了。
    蒙族老太太霍素贞特别激动。她今年六十三岁了，有三个儿子，一个参加了解放军，两个参加了志愿军。一次，在朝鲜的一个儿子韩汝霖负伤了，他给母亲写来一封信，信上说：“妈，你不用惦念我，朝鲜的爸爸妈妈待我可好，如同在家一样。我负伤后，朝鲜的爸爸们把我抬着往回送，中途遇上敌人的飞机轰炸，他们怕炸着我，就爬在我的身上遮护着。妈，你看朝鲜的爸爸们多么疼我啊！”霍素贞老太太接到这封信后，几天几夜睡不着。母亲的心又惦记着自己的孩子，又感激着这些把自己儿子当亲生的儿子一样照顾的朝鲜老乡！路远又不能去看他们，只怪儿子没有告诉姓名地址，连信也不能写
  一封去。好容易听说朝鲜人民派了自己的代表上中国来，上归绥来了，还特地要和志愿军的烈属、军属见见面，老太太喜欢得真不知道怎样才好。她从箱子底里翻出一件还是做媳妇时穿的紫色的五彩滚宽边的长袍来，穿着来参加会来了。回族老大爷马瑞的老母亲，今年九十五岁了，她有一个独生孙子马治民在朝鲜和朝鲜人民一起作战，他听到朝鲜的亲人要和烈属、军属会面，巴不得也要去；马瑞因为她年纪太大，行动不便，答应她一定代她向代表团的首长问好，一定代她感谢照顾治民的那些朝鲜爸爸妈妈们，老太太才放下心，现在马瑞老大爷也急急忙忙走来了。
    “日盼，夜盼可把你们盼来了。”在会场上，蒙族老太太霍素贞拉着共和国英雄柳万洙的手，感激地说。
    马瑞老大爷带着心满意足的神情坐在会场，聚精会神地听着共和国英雄朴赞洙的报告。朴赞洙说：停战以后他们和志愿军一道从军事分界线撤退到第一道防线，他们的工事和志愿军的紧挨着，相距只有五十公尺宽。夜间，游动放哨的时候，朴赞洙背着枪出去巡逻，常常和放哨的志愿军走到一起了。“虽然大家言语不通”，“但是我们互相碰碰肩膀，这就是说：‘我们时时刻刻提高警惕，来守卫着我们共同的防线，来保卫我们共同的亲人’”。马瑞老大爷听到这里，忘了民族的习惯，一把紧紧抱住朴赞洙，连连亲着他，叫着：“我的孩子”。朴赞洙看着面前这位激动的老人，也亲切地叫着他“老爹爹”。
    马瑞老大爷又记起了老母亲的嘱托，他鼓起勇气走到代表团金应基团长面前说：“我的九十五岁的老母亲想来看您，年纪大了，身体不好，来不了，让我代她问您好，问全体朝鲜父亲、母亲们好。我的儿子在朝鲜受到朝鲜爸爸、妈妈的照顾，实在是非常的感谢。”金应基团长连忙站起来，尊敬地看着这位满头白发的老人，诚挚地说：“今天看到你，就如看到自己的亲人一样高兴。谢谢你的老母亲，希望她保重身体，长命百岁，有一个幸福的晚年”。（附图片）
