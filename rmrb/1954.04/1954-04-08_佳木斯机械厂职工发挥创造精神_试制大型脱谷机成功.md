    Jiamusi Machinery Factory Workers Display Creativity
    Successfully Trial Produce Large Threshing Machine
    The state-owned Jiamusi Machinery Factory in Songjiang Province successfully trial-produced a large threshing machine on March 16 and held a test run on March 28. After technical appraisal, the quality of the machine reached the specified standards.
    The large threshing machine, manufactured for the first time by the Jiamusi Machinery Factory, is six meters long, 3.17 meters high, and weighs 3.9 tons. The complexity of this machine is second only to combine harvesters. It can thresh barley, wheat, oats, millet, foxtail millet, soybeans, sorghum, etc. With 28 laborers working a day, it can thresh 50,000 catties of grain, equivalent to the labor efficiency of 100 farmers and 75 horses.
    The Jiamusi Machinery Factory has relatively low technical conditions, with most of the production tools being manual. In the past, it could only produce simple plows, harrows, cultivators, and seeders. This time, manufacturing a large threshing machine was a very arduous task. However, the propaganda of the General Line and the education of the worker-peasant alliance greatly inspired the workers' enthusiasm for labor. After they officially started the trial production on January 10, they enthusiastically launched a technical innovation movement. Worker Zhang Zhenfa said: "The peasant brothers keep asking us to produce new-style farm tools. We must overcome any difficulties, no matter how great!" So he and technician Wang Hongjiang studied and created a mold tool that could produce a fish-scale sieve in half an hour, solving the main key problem in the trial production. Thanks to the workers' creativity, a total of 74 types of handicraft production tools were improved during the trial production process.
    In the work of trial-producing the large threshing machine, the factory improved the old equipment, improved the technical level of the workers, and laid a good foundation for semi-mechanization, mechanization, and mass production. Some workers who were previously unwilling to work in the factory are now settled down to production. Some workers said: "In the past, I thought there was no future, but now I feel that my skills are not enough, and I can't finish learning the technology."
    Currently, all the workers in the factory are actively learning Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, planning to shorten the trial production time from more than 8,000 hours to more than 2,000 hours, and determined to produce a large number of high-quality, low-cost threshing machines.

### 佳木斯机械厂职工发挥创造精神  试制大型脱谷机成功

    佳木斯机械厂职工发挥创造精神
    试制大型脱谷机成功
    松江省地方国营佳木斯机械厂在三月十六日试制大型脱谷机成功，并在三月二十八日举行了试车。经过技术鉴定，这台机器的质量达到了规定的标准。
    佳木斯机械厂首次制成的大型脱谷机身长六公尺，高三点一七公尺，重三点九吨。这种机器的复杂性，仅次于联合收割机和康拜因。它能打大麦、小麦、燕麦、糜子、谷子、大豆、高粱等，一天用二十八个人工，可打五万斤粮食，相当于一百个农民、七十五匹马的劳动效率。
    佳木斯机械厂技术条件较低，大部是手工的生产工具，过去仅能生产简单的犁耙、铲趟机和播种机，这次制造大型脱谷机是一件十分艰巨的任务。但是，总路线的宣传和工农联盟的教育，大大鼓舞了职工的劳动热情。他们从一月十日正式开始试制后，就热烈地展开了技术革新运动。工人张振发说：“农民兄弟口口声声要我们生产新式农具，天大的困难也要克服它！”于是他和技术员王洪江研究，创造了一个胎模工具，半小时就能生产一个鱼鳞筛，解决了试制中的主要关键问题。由于工人们发挥了创造性，试制过程中共改进了七十四种手工业生产工具。
    该厂在试制大型脱谷机工作中，改进了旧有设备，提高了工人的技术水平，为半机械化和机械化和大批生产打下了良好的基础。过去有些不愿在该厂工作的工人，现在也安心生产了。有的工人说：“过去认为没有前途，这回就觉得本事不够用，技术学不完了。”
    目前，全厂职工正积极学习王崇伦的革新精神，计划由试制八千多小时，缩短为两千多小时，决心生产大批质量好、成本低的脱谷机。
