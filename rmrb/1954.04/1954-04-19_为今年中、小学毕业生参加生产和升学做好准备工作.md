Editorial:

    The issue of participation in production labor and further education for graduates of higher primary and junior middle schools is a significant matter concerning national construction and the vital interests of the broad masses of the people. All localities should carefully summarize the experiences of last year in resolving this issue and make timely preparations to resolve it this year based on the specific circumstances.

    The number of higher primary and junior middle school graduates in our country is increasing year by year, which is a gratifying phenomenon. This phenomenon is gratifying not only because it reflects the gradual improvement of the people's material life and cultural level, but also because it meets the actual needs of national construction. The great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation requires not only experts in various fields but also more young people with a certain degree of political awareness and cultural knowledge. In industry, skilled workers need to have a certain level of education. According to the experience of the Northeast, modern industrial technicians, especially heavy industrial technicians, need a considerable level of education. And in the vast countryside, the significant role of educated youth participating in agricultural production in improving agricultural technology and promoting agricultural production cooperativization has also been demonstrated by many facts. The deeds of Xu Jianchun, a higher primary school graduate from Houlu Village, Yexian County, Shandong Province, are a typical example.

    Based on last year's experience, to guide higher primary and junior middle school graduates to participate in production and construction work, we must first do a good job of propaganda and education. In the past few years, there have been serious shortcomings in our school education and social propaganda. The nature and tasks of school education have rarely been comprehensively and clearly explained in connection with the actual situation of national construction. We often one-sidedly encourage students to go on to higher education to become experts and cadres, and some even intentionally or unintentionally spread bourgeois individualism to students, aiming to become experts for personal status and enjoyment. Labor education, as an important part of socialist ideological education, has been severely neglected. Coupled with the influence of the old society's thinking of "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," many middle and primary school students despise labor, despise workers and peasants, and lack a sense of honor for labor production. This is the main ideological obstacle to their participation in production and construction work. All localities must learn from last year's experience and, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, organize forces from all aspects to conduct in-depth and meticulous propaganda and education work among students, teachers, parents, cadres, and the masses through report meetings, symposiums, family visits, graduate and parent representative meetings, and people's representative meetings, and by using various propaganda tools in a planned manner.

    First, it is necessary to connect with the actual situation of the local area and specifically explain that China's people's education has greatly developed in the past four years, and a large number of workers' and peasants' children have entered schools. This situation not only proves the importance attached to education by the Party and the People's Government and the great achievements made in implementing the policy of increasing the proportion of workers and peasants among students, but also proves that school education can only develop correspondingly by first developing industrial and agricultural production. If our country had not vigorously carried out the restoration, reform, and development of industry and agriculture in the past four years, the lives of the working people would not have been improved, their children would not have been able to enter schools in such large numbers, and the state would not have been able to run so many schools. As everyone knows, the educational foundation left to us by old China was very weak. At a time when our country is concentrating its main manpower, material resources, and financial resources on economic construction, the Party and the People's Government have already made great efforts in developing school education. It is unrealistic to demand that all higher primary and junior middle school graduates who increase year by year should go on to higher education. Second, it is necessary to clearly explain the nature and tasks of middle and primary school education. Our primary school education is the basic education of the people. Its main task is to improve the cultural level of the broad masses of working people, cultivate a reserve labor force with a certain degree of political awareness and cultural knowledge for industrial and agricultural production, make it easier for them to learn and master advanced production technologies when participating in production work, become experts on the production front, and only a part of them can go on to higher education. Middle school education is general education. Its task is to cultivate a reserve labor force with a higher political and cultural level for the country, in addition to sending some new students to universities. In the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation, with the continuous improvement and improvement of production technology, the importance of cultivating this reserve force will also become increasingly prominent. The idea that workers and peasants in the new China can do without culture and that it is "too regrettable" for middle and primary school graduates to participate in production labor is obviously wrong. Third, it is necessary to publicize the truth that labor creates the world and enhance everyone's sense of honor for labor production through the personal experiences of the working people and the vivid deeds of labor models. Labor creation is the only source of social wealth, and it is a glorious and heroic undertaking in the people's country. A beautiful new socialist life can only be gradually built up with clever minds and diligent hands. Loving the motherland and loving labor are indispensable virtues for the people of the new China, and the era of despising labor and despising the working people is long gone.

    Some students believe that participating in production labor, especially participating in agricultural production labor, cannot lead to innovation in science and technology, cannot realize their lofty ideals, and cannot make great contributions to the construction of the motherland. This is also an incorrect idea. Comrade Stalin said in 1938 when receiving workers from higher education institutions in the Kremlin: "...Sometimes, those who open up new paths in science and technology are not famous figures in the scientific community, but ordinary figures in the scientific community, ordinary people, practitioners, and innovators. Among those present here are Comrade Stakhanov and Comrade Babanin. They are not famous figures in the scientific community, they are not people with degrees, but practitioners in their own professions. But who does not know that Stakhanov and the Stakhanov workers, when engaged in practical work in industry, overturned the existing standards set by famous figures in the scientific and technical circles as outdated standards, and implemented new standards suitable for the requirements of true science and technology? Who does not know that Babanin and the Babanin explorers, when engaged in practical work on the drifting ice, effortlessly overturned the old concepts about the Arctic Ocean as outdated concepts, and laid the new concepts suitable for the requirements of true science? Who can deny that Stakhanov and Babanin are innovators in science and figures in our advanced scientific community?..." It can be seen that in a country led by the Communist Party and the working class, engaging in any work that is beneficial to the people can gain the respect of the people and the attention of the Party and the government; practitioners in any field can carry out innovation work and achieve outstanding results. In our own motherland, haven't a large number of innovators also emerged from ordinary workers and peasants?

    Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, combined with the propaganda and education work of the general line for the country's transition period, in connection with the actual situation of cities and villages, through the actual examples of middle and primary school graduates participating in industrial and agricultural production and achieving remarkable results, and in light of the ideological situation of different objects, repeatedly explain the above-mentioned principles to improve their ideological understanding. This is an effective method to gradually overcome the ideological obstacles of middle and primary school graduates participating in production and construction work.

    While carrying out propaganda and education work, we must also do a good job in organizational work with leadership and planning. This is also an important experience from last year. In cities and industrial and mining areas, the education department, enterprise department, personnel department, labor department, and trade union and the Communist Youth League, etc., must cooperate closely under the unified leadership of the Party committee, find out the actual situation of all aspects, do a good job in specific arrangements based on facts, so that the enterprise department can absorb and train a certain number of junior middle and higher primary school graduates in a planned manner according to actual needs; and after they participate in production work, they should always give them care and help in terms of work and study, so that they can continue to move forward with full confidence. In rural areas, we should mobilize and organize the majority of higher primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production labor. The leading comrades of the Party, government, and the Communist Youth League in rural areas and the grassroots working cadres must fully understand the great significance and role of educated youth participating in agricultural production, take a positive and welcoming attitude towards them, value them, care for them, encourage them, guide them to participate in social activities, give full play to their role, and after they participate in production work, according to the actual situation of the local area, through various ways and methods, help them carry out amateur learning as much as possible, and continuously improve their political and cultural level on the existing basis, so as to better serve production and construction. This has a huge effect on enhancing their confidence in work and consolidating their production emotions.

    Under the current circumstances, it is absolutely necessary to educate and organize most higher primary school graduates and some junior middle school graduates to participate in production and construction work; and on the other hand, we must also try our best to tap the potential of existing middle schools, and appropriately develop secondary education, mainly high school, according to possible conditions, in order to admit as many higher primary and junior middle school graduates as possible. At the same time, factories and mining enterprises should hold full-day or half-day middle schools as much as possible to absorb mainly the children of employees in this unit, and appropriately enroll some children of nearby residents. All localities should also, according to needs and possible conditions, hold or rectify various tutoring schools, tutoring classes, radio lectures, night middle schools, correspondence schools, self-study groups, and other learning organizations with leadership and planning to give junior middle and higher primary school graduates who cannot go on to higher education but are temporarily unable to participate in production labor the opportunity to continue learning.

    Taking the education and organization of higher primary and junior middle school graduates to participate in production labor as the main focus, while making every effort to tap the potential of existing schools, appropriately developing secondary education with emphasis, and holding or improving various auxiliary learning organizations with leadership and planning - this is our solution to the problem of higher primary and junior middle school graduates participating in production labor and going on to higher education this year. Party and government leading organs and related working cadres in all localities should deal with this issue with an active and proactive attitude, and school teachers and student parents should also recognize their important responsibility for nurturing the younger generation and must treat children who cannot go on to higher education with the correct attitude; especially for those children who cannot go on to higher education and have difficulty participating in production labor for a while, they should be given sincere encouragement and active help so that they can carry out self-study in a planned way and play their role in appropriate work in the family and society. The Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers should strengthen the education and organization of members and team members who cannot go on to higher education and unite other students who have not been able to go on to higher education through them, help them organize their studies, and guide them to participate in social work and cultural, sports, and other activities. As long as the forces of all parties cooperate closely under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, difficulties can be overcome.

### 为今年中、小学毕业生参加生产和升学做好准备工作

    为今年中、小学毕业生参加生产和升学做好准备工作
    高小和初中毕业生的参加生产劳动和升学问题，是关系国家建设和广大人民切身利益的重大问题。各地应该好好总结去年解决这一问题的经验，根据今年的具体情况，及时地为今年解决这一问题做好准备工作。
    我国高小和初中毕业生逐年增加，这是一种可喜的现象。这一现象之所以可喜，不但因为它反映了人民群众的物质生活和文化水平的逐步提高，而且因为它是适应国家建设的实际需要的。社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业，不仅需要各方面的专家，而且需要更多的有一定政治觉悟和文化知识的青年。在工业方面，技术工人是需要有一定文化水平的。根据东北的经验，现代工业技术工人，特别是重工业技术工人，需要有相当的文化程度。而在广大的农村，知识青年参加农业生产对改进农业技术、促进农业生产合作化的显著作用，也由许多事实证明了。山东省掖县后吕村的高小毕业生徐建春的事迹，便是典型的例子。
    根据去年的经验，要引导高小和初中毕业生参加生产建设工作，首先必须做好宣传教育工作。在过去几年中，我们的学校教育和社会宣传中都存在着严重的缺点，对学校教育的性质和任务，很少联系国家建设的实际情况，全面地、明确地加以阐明，往往片面地鼓励学生升学当专家、当干部，有的甚至有意无意地向学生散布了资产阶级的个人主义思想，为了个人的地位和享受而当专家。作为社会主义思想教育重要组成部分的劳动教育，遭受到严重的忽视。再加上旧社会遗留下来的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的思想影响，便使得许多中、小学生轻视劳动，轻视工人和农民，缺乏对劳动生产的光荣感。这是他们参加生产建设工作的主要思想障碍。各地必须吸取去年的经验，在党委的统一领导下，组织各方面的力量，通过报告会、座谈会、家庭访问、毕业生和家长代表会议以及人民代表会议等形式，并运用各种宣传工具，有计划地向学生、教师、家长、干部和群众进行深入的、细致的宣传教育工作。
    首先要联系当地实际情况，具体说明四年来我国人民教育事业有了很大的发展，工农子女大量入学。这种情况不但证明了党和人民政府对教育事业的重视，不但证明了执行增加学生中的工农成份的方针，已经取得巨大的收获，而且证明了只有首先发展工农业生产，才能相应地发展学校教育。如果我国四年来不大力进行工农业的恢复、改革和发展工作，劳动人民的生活就不能得到改善，他们的子女就不可能如此大量地进入学校，国家也不可能办这么多学校。大家知道，旧中国遗留给我们的教育基础是十分薄弱的。在我国正在集中主要人力、物力和财力进行经济建设的时候，党和人民政府在发展学校教育方面已经作了极大的努力。如果逐年增加的全部高小和初中毕业生都要升学，那是不切实际的要求。第二，要明确地说明中、小学教育的性质和任务。我们的小学教育是人民的基础教育，其主要任务在于提高广大劳动人民的文化水平，为工农业生产培养有一定政治觉悟和文化知识的劳动后备力量，使他们在参加生产工作时易于学习和掌握先进生产技术，成为生产战线上的能手，升学的只能占其中的一部分。中学教育是普通教育，它的任务，除为高等学校输送一部分新生以外，也要为国家培养有较高政治、文化水平的劳动后备力量。在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的过程中，跟着生产技术的不断改进和提高，培养这种后备力量的重要性也将日益突出地显示出来。认为新中国的工人农民可以不要文化，中、小学毕业生参加生产劳动“太可惜”的想法，显然是不对的。第三，必须通过劳动人民的切身经验和劳动模范的生动事迹，宣传劳动创造世界的真理，提高大家对劳动生产的光荣感。劳动创造是社会财富的唯一来源，在人民国家里是荣誉和豪迈的事业。美好的社会主义新生活，只有用聪明的头脑和勤劳的双手，才能逐步把它建立起来。热爱祖国、热爱劳动，正是新中国人民不可缺少的美德，轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的时代，早已
  一去不复返了。
    有些学生认为参加生产劳动，特别是参加农业生产劳动，就不能在科学技术方面有所创造，不能实现自己的远大理想，不能对祖国建设作巨大的贡献，这也是不正确的想法。斯大林同志一九三八年在克里姆林宫招待高等学校工作人员时说：“……有时候，开拓科学和技术新道路的，竟不是在科学界著名的人物，而是在科学界全不著名的人物，平凡的人物，实践家，工作革新者。这里座中有斯大哈诺夫同志和巴巴宁同志。他们是不著名于科学界的人物，是没有学位的人物，是自己本行事业的实践家。可是谁不知道斯大哈诺夫和斯大哈诺夫工作者在工业方面从事实际工作时，把科学界技术界著名人物所规定的那些现行标准作为陈腐标准推翻，而施行了适合于真正科学和技术要求的新标准呢？谁不知道巴巴宁和巴巴宁探险家在流动冰上从事实际工作时，没费特别工夫，就顺便把关于北冰洋的旧观念作为陈腐观念推翻，而奠定了适合于真正科学要求的新观念呢？谁能否认斯大哈诺夫和巴巴宁是科学中的革新者，是我们先进科学界中的人物呢？……”可见在共产党和工人阶级领导下的国家，从事任何有益于人民的工作，都能取得人民的尊敬，党和政府的重视；任何方面的实际工作者，都有可能进行革新工作，获得卓越的成绩。在我们自己的祖国，不是也从普通工人农民中涌现了大批革新者吗？
    在党委统一领导下，结合国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育工作，联系城市和乡村的实际情况，通过中、小学毕业生参加工农业生产、获得显著成绩的实际范例，针对不同对象的思想情况，反复说明上述的道理，以提高他们的思想认识，这便是逐渐克服中、小学毕业生参加生产建设工作的思想障碍的有效方法。
    在进行宣传教育工作的同时，还必须有领导、有计划地作好组织工作，这也是去年的一条重要经验。在城市和工矿区，教育部门、企业部门、人事部门、劳动部门，以及工会和青年团等，必须在党委的统一领导下密切合作，摸清各方面的实际情况，实事求是地作好具体安排，以便企业部门根据实际需要，有计划地吸收和训练一定数量的初中和高小毕业生；并在他们参加生产工作之后，在工作和学习方面经常给以关怀和帮助，使他们满怀信心地不断前进。在农村，应动员和组织广大高小毕业生参加农业生产劳动。农村的党、政、团的领导同志和基层工作干部都必须充分认识知识青年参加农业生产的重大意义和作用，对他们采取积极欢迎的态度，重视他们，关心他们，鼓励他们，引导他们参加社会活动，充分发挥他们的作用，并在他们参加生产工作之后，根据当地实际情况，通过各种方式方法，尽可能地帮助他们进行业余学习，在现有的基础上不断提高政治、文化水平，以便更好地为生产建设服务。这对于提高他们的工作信心和巩固他们的生产情绪，有非常巨大的作用。
    在目前的情况下，教育和组织大部分高小毕业生和一部分初中毕业生参加生产建设工作，那是完全必要的；而在另一方面，也必须尽量挖掘现有中学的潜力，并根据可能条件，适当发展中学教育，主要是高中，以便尽可能地多收一些高小和初中毕业生。同时，厂矿企业应该尽可能地举办整日制或半日制的中学，以吸收本单位职工子女为主，并酌量招收一部分附近居民的子女。各地还应该根据需要和可能条件，有领导、有计划地举办或整顿各种补习学校、补习班、广播讲座、夜中学、函授学校、自学小组以及其他各种各样的学习组织，给不能升学而暂时又不可能参加生产劳动的初中和高小毕业生以继续学习的机会。
    以教育和组织高小和初中毕业生参加生产劳动为主，同时尽量挖掘现有学校的潜力，有重点地适当发展中学教育，并有领导、有计划地举办或改进各种辅助学习组织——这便是我们解决今年高小和初中毕业生参加生产劳动和升学问题的办法。各地党、政领导机关和有关工作干部都要用主动、积极的态度来处理这一问题，而学校教师和学生家长也要认识自己对抚育年青一代的重大责任，必须用正确的态度对待不能升学的孩子们；尤其对那些不能升学而一时又难于参加生产劳动的孩子，更要给以亲切的鼓励和积极的帮助，使他们有计划地进行自修，并在家庭和社会的适当工作中发挥自己的力量。青年团和少先队应加强对不能升学的团员、队员的教育和组织工作，并通过他们团结其他未能升学的学生，帮助他们组织学习，引导他们参加社会工作和文娱、体育等活动。只要各方面力量在党和人民政府的领导下密切配合，困难是能够克服的。
