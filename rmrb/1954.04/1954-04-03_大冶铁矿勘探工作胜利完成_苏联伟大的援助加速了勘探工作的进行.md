Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch: The large-scale exploration work at the Daye Iron Mine has been successfully completed. The Daye Iron Mine Geological Exploration Report, summarizing all exploration results, has been submitted to the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government on March 29th after final meticulous review and verification. This report will be the main basis for our country to build a new iron and steel base in the Daye area.

    The exploration work of Daye Iron Mine is one of the key projects of resource exploration in our country, which lasted nearly two years from beginning to end. All the staff of the 429 Exploration Team directly under the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, who undertook this work, carried out large-scale geological drilling, trenching, pitting, physical prospecting, sampling, chemical analysis, surveying, mapping, hydrogeology, meteorological surveys, data collation and research in the entire mining area in the past two years. Their footprints have covered every corner of this vast area, and they have collected abundant geological resource data. The drillers alone completed more than four times the total number of boreholes completed by imperialist countries and the Kuomintang reactionaries in this area in the sixty years before liberation, with a total drilling depth of more than 40,000 meters. The analysts analyzed more than 8,400 different mineral samples during the same period. The sufficient data collected through this large-scale exploration proves that the actual reserves of the Daye Iron Mine are much larger than any historical estimates, and also exceed the state's expected figures. At the same time, the data proves that the iron content of the Daye Iron Mine is very high, and the ore contains many elements that are beneficial to steelmaking.

    The great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union has played a significant role in accelerating the completion of the exploration work at the Daye Iron Mine.

    The Soviet Union's advanced geological science theories and superb technology have helped the Daye Iron Mine Geological Exploration Team solve many key problems. In July 1952, Soviet expert Krotki came to the Daye mining area despite the scorching heat. He taught the Daye Exploration Team the Soviet Union's advanced geological exploration experience, such as exploration procedures and mineral deposit calculation methods, which quickly put the exploration work of Daye Iron Mine on the right track. Based on Krotki's suggestion, new mineral deposits were discovered in Jianlinshan and Jinshandiang in the Daye mining area, and a second layer of iron ore was discovered under the main body of the Shizishan mine. These discoveries not only brought a new evaluation to Daye Iron Mine, but also improved the theoretical and technical level of geological workers. In 1953, due to the incomplete understanding of the ore deposit types of Tieshan by the geological personnel, some shortcomings were caused in the exploration work, and these shortcomings would cause difficulties in future mining if they were not overcome. Soviet experts Mideev and others immediately discovered this problem after arriving in Tieshan and proposed perfect solutions to help solve it.

    The advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union has been promoted in all departments of the Daye Exploration Team, and great results have been achieved. From the second half of 1953 to the first quarter of 1954, all drilling teams generally promoted the Soviet advanced "one-time sand injection method" and "mud operation method" on the basis of steel grit drilling, which increased the drilling efficiency by half to one time, and the core recovery rate increased by one and a half to two times. The Soviet "fast flow operation method" increased the efficiency of the laboratory by about two and a half times. In terms of geological surveying, the problem of insufficient manpower was also solved by implementing the Soviet observation point mapping method.

    The Daye Iron Mine Exploration Team also received a large amount of modern machinery and equipment assistance from the Soviet Union. The Daye Exploration Team has dozens of Soviet drilling rigs that can drill to a depth of 300 meters to 1,200 meters, and the working efficiency of these drilling rigs far exceeds that of drilling rigs in capitalist countries. As a result of using Soviet drilling rigs and promoting the Soviet steel grit drilling method, the area where only three centimeters could be drilled per day in the past now drills three meters per day, thus quickly discovering huge mineral deposits under Jianlinshan.

    大冶铁矿勘探工作胜利完成
    苏联伟大的援助加速了勘探工作的进行
    据新华社武汉电：规模巨大的大冶铁矿勘探工作已胜利完成。综合全部勘探成果的大冶铁矿地质勘探报告，经过最后的缜密审查和核对，已在三月二十九日送往中央人民政府地质部。这个报告将是我国在大冶地区建设新的钢铁基地的主要依据。
    大冶铁矿的勘探工作是我国资源勘探的重点工程之一，从开始到结束总共经历了将近两年的时间。负担这一工作的中央人民政府地质部直属四二九勘探队的全体职工，两年来在整个矿区范围内进行了大规模的地质钻探、槽探、坑探、物理探矿、采样、化验、测量、绘图、水文地质、气象调查、资料整理和研究等各项工作。他们的足迹踏遍了这一片辽阔地区的每一个角落，搜集到了丰富的地质资源资料。仅钻探工人们两年来完成的钻孔，就超过解放前六十年间帝国主义国家和国民党反动派在这个地区完成的钻孔总数的四倍以上，钻进的总深度超过了四万多公尺。化验人员们在同一时期内分析的各种矿样，达八千四百多个。这些经过大规模勘探搜集到的充分的资料，证明大冶铁矿的实际储量比历史上的一切估计都要多得多，而且也超过了国家的预期数字。同时，资料证明大冶铁矿的含铁率很高，并且矿石里含有许多对炼钢有益的元素。
    苏联的伟大无私的援助，对大冶铁矿的加速完成勘探工作起了重大作用。
    苏联先进的地质科学理论和精湛的技术，帮助大冶铁矿的地质勘探队解决了许多关键性的问题。一九五二年七月，苏联专家克罗特基冒着酷暑来到大冶矿区。他把苏联先进的地质勘探经验如勘探程序、矿量计算等教给了大冶勘探队，使大冶铁矿的勘探工作迅速纳入正轨。根据克罗特基的建议，大冶矿区先后在尖林山、金山店发现了新矿藏，并在狮子山的主体矿下发现了第二层铁矿。这些发现不但给大冶铁矿带来了新的评价，而且也提高了地质工作者的理论和技术水平。一九五三年，由于地质人员们对铁山矿藏类型的认识不够完整，曾使勘探工作产生了一些缺点，这些缺点如不克服，将来开采时就会带来困难。苏联专家米德耶夫等来到铁山后，立即发现了这个问题，并提出完善的办法帮助加以解决。
    苏联先进的技术经验在大冶勘探队的各个工作部门中推广，都收到了很大效果。一九五三年下半年到一九五四年第一季度内，各个钻探队普遍在钢砂钻进的基础上推行了苏联先进的“一次投砂法”和“泥浆作业法”，使钻进效率提高了半倍到一倍，岩芯采取率提高了一倍半到两倍。苏联“快速流水作业法”使化验室的工作效率提高了两倍半左右。地质测量方面也因为推行了苏联的观测点填图法，从而解决了人力不足的问题。
    大冶铁矿的勘探队还得到苏联大量的现代化机器设备的援助。大冶勘探队拥有几十台能钻进三百公尺到一千二百公尺深的苏联钻机，这些钻机的工作效能远远地超过资本主义国家的钻机。使用苏联钻机并推行苏联钢砂钻进法的结果，就在过去每天只能钻进三公寸的地方每天钻进了三公尺，因而迅速地在尖林山下发现了巨大的矿藏。
