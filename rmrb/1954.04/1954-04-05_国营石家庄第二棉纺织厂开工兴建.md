The construction of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, one of the four major new cotton textile factories to be built by the Central Textile Industry Ministry this year, officially began on March 15th. This cotton textile factory is twice the size of the state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory built last year. Once completed, it will provide more and more beautiful yarn and cloth to meet the needs of the people.

Before the start of this massive project, the construction department made full preparations. The factory's construction will utilize various machines such as cranes, electric winches, stone crushers, universal loaders and unloaders, and automatic conveyors. A network of light railways has been laid on the site, and several highway transportation lines have also been opened up. The workers have high enthusiasm for labor, and each type of work has put forward guarantees to complete the civil engineering work (excluding chemical flooring) and electrical installation by the end of December this year, and to ensure the installation of 10,000 spindles and 250 looms before the New Year.

Currently, more than 2,000 construction workers have launched into an intense labor competition on the construction site. Large machines such as stone crushers, road rollers, and stone sifting machines have already started operating.

    国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂开工兴建
    中央纺织工业部今年新建四大棉纺织厂之一——国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂，已在三月十五日正式动工兴建。这座棉纺织厂比去年新建的国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂的规模大一倍，它建成以后，将有更多更美丽的纱布供应人民需要。
    这巨大工程开工以前，施工部门曾作了充分的准备工作。这个厂子的建设要用起重机、电动卷扬机、碎石机、万能装卸机、自动运输带等各种机器施工。现场已经铺好了纵横交错的轻便铁道，还开辟了几条公路运输线。工人们劳动热情很高，各工种都提出了保证，在今年十二月底完成土建工程
  （化学地板除外）和电气安装，并保证在年前安装好一万纱锭和二百五十台布机。
    现在工地上两千多名建筑工人已展开了紧张的劳动竞赛，碎石机、轧路机、筛石机等大型机器已在工地上转动起来。
