Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: Commentary by Jiang Nan: The Geneva Conference is approaching. All good people around the world, especially the French people, hope that this conference can lead to the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, the US ruling group has been carrying out various activities to undermine the Geneva Conference. Therefore, the world cannot but pay close attention to the attitude of the French ruling group on the Indochina issue. Will they seek a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue through consultation, according to the wishes of the French people? Or will they obey the US warmongering clique to obstruct the Geneva Conference in order to continue or even expand the Indochina war?

The people of all strata in France have clearly realized that the "dirty war" in Indochina is the main cause of the deep disasters suffered by their country and themselves. This war has caused huge losses to France and caused serious economic difficulties. This war has also brought an increasing burden to the French people, constantly lowering their living standards, and driving their children and husbands to the distant Indochina battlefield to die in vain. At the same time, the United States is using this war and the arms expansion and war preparation policy it has imposed on France to damage the dignity of French national independence, weaken France's status as a major power, and make it increasingly dependent on the United States. The facts are very clear that only the US ruling group benefits from continuing the Indochina war. Therefore, the people of all strata in France are increasingly widely involved in the struggle to safeguard the dignity of national independence and defend their right to life, resolutely demanding an end to the Indochina war and opposing continuing to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States in Indochina. It is obvious that only when this wish of the French people is realized can France get out of its difficult situation and the French people get rid of the heavy burden imposed on them.

However, for selfish interests and against the peaceful wishes of the French people, the US ruling group is using various methods to tie France tightly to the US war chariot, forcing it to continue the war in Indochina, so that the United States can intensify international tensions. As the Geneva Conference approaches, those in the United States who fear peace in Indochina like the fear of the Day of Judgment, have fully launched a propaganda campaign aimed at opposing peaceful consultations and expanding the war of aggression, openly threatening to take "united action" in Indochina, turning the Indochina war into a second Korean war, and attempting to use this to carry out more aggressive activities against the People's Republic of China. In order to tie the hesitant allies together and force them to follow the United States in taking risks, the US ruling group is forcing France and other allies to sign the so-called "joint statement" drafted by them, which is aimed at undermining the Geneva Conference and expanding the Indochina war, and specifically asking the US allies to promise the number of troops they are willing to provide to participate in the Indochina war. At the same time, the US ruling group is stepping up the sending of large numbers of military personnel and military equipment to Indochina, and is trying its best to force France to hand over the training rights of the puppet army, in an attempt to further seize the command and control of the war in order to replace France's position in Indochina. Needless to say, this warmongering policy of the United States is of no benefit to peace and security in the Far East, and is especially harmful to France's interests. Patriotic people of all strata in France have expressed great indignation and protest against this policy of the United States.

However, up to now, some figures in the French ruling group, under the coercion and instigation of the US ruling group, have still not given up their idea of ​​relying on the United States to continue the war in Indochina. According to this idea, French Prime Minister Laniel once put forward so-called "truce" conditions that essentially rejected ceasefire negotiations, and still insists on these so-called "conditions." In order to obtain a so-called "position of strength" according to the US proposal, French Chief of Staff Ély recently went to Washington to beg for US assistance and planned to continue the war in Indochina. Recently, some people in France who are particularly fond of relying on the United States have issued urgent appeals to the US ruling group, requesting more aircraft, artillery, and military equipment in order to step up the war in Indochina. The attitude of these people in the French ruling group shows that although they have expressed their willingness to seek a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue at the upcoming Geneva Conference, they are pinning their hopes on the US ruling group and attempting to continue the Indochina war. Of course, the attitude of these people does not match the urgent desire of the French people to end the Indochina war through consultation, but it meets the dangerous requirements of the US ruling group to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina war.

The upcoming Geneva Conference provides a starting point for ending the Indochina war. It is entirely possible to achieve a ceasefire and restore peace. President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has expressed such a desire. This desire is in line with the desire of the French people and the peace-loving people of the world. Only by striving to make the Geneva Conference a success, instead of following the United States to obstruct and undermine this conference, can this desire be realized.

    全世界注视法统治集团对印度支那的政策
    是继续殖民战争为美国火中取栗还是努力开好日内瓦会议？
    【新华社十三日讯】本社评论员江南评论：日内瓦会议日益迫近了。全世界善良人民，尤其是法国人民，都希望这个会议能够导致恢复印度支那的和平。但是美国统治集团却一直在进行各种破坏日内瓦会议的活动。因此，目前全世界不能不密切注意，法国统治集团在印度支那问题上究竟采取什么态度。根据法国人民的愿望，以协商的方式谋求印度支那问题的和平解决？还是顺从美国好战集团来阻挠日内瓦会议，以便继续甚至扩大印度支那战争？
    法国各阶层人民已经清楚地认识到，在印度支那进行的“肮脏的战争”是使得他们的国家和他们自己蒙受深重的灾难的主要原因。这个战争使法国遭受了巨大的损失，引起了经济上严重的困难。这个战争还给法国人民带来了日益加重的负担，不断降低了他们的生活水平，并且把他们的子弟和丈夫驱策到遥远的印度支那战场上去无谓地送死。同时，美国正在利用这个战争以及它强加于法国的扩军备战政策，来损害法国民族独立的尊严，削弱法国的大国地位，使得它日益依赖美国。事实十分清楚，继续进行印度支那战争，得到好处的只是美国统治集团。所以，法国各阶层人民愈来愈广泛地投入了维护民族独立的尊严和保卫自己生活权利的斗争，坚决地要求结束印度支那的战争和反对继续在印度支那为美国火中取栗。十分明显，唯有法国人民的这种愿望得到实现，才能使法国走出它的困难境地，使法国人民摆脱强加在他们身上的重担。
    但是，美国统治集团为了自私的利益，违反法国人民的和平意愿，正在用种种办法把法国紧紧地缚在美国的战车上，迫使它继续在印度支那进行战争，以便美国来加剧国际紧张局势。随着日内瓦会议的临近，美国的那些像害怕末日审判一样害怕印度支那的和平的人，全力发动了一个旨在反对和平协商、扩大侵略战争的宣传运动，公开威胁要在印度支那采取“联合行动”，把印度支那战争变成第二个朝鲜战争，企图借此对中华人民共和国进行更多的侵略活动。为了把三心二意的盟国紧紧地缚在一起，迫使它们跟着美国一道进行冒险，美国统治集团正在逼迫法国和其他盟国在他们一手拟定的旨在破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的所谓“联合声明”上签字，并且要美国的盟国具体答应愿意提供参加印度支那战争的军队的数量。同时，美国统治集团正在加紧把大批军事人员和军事装备送到印度支那去，并且竭力逼迫法国交出伪军的训练权，企图进一步夺取战争的指挥权和控制权，以便取代法国在印度支那的地位。不待说，美国的这种好战政策对远东和平与安全毫无好处，对法国的利益尤其有害。法国各阶层爱国人士对美国的这种政策都表示了很大的愤慨和抗议。
    然而，到现在为止，法国统治集团中的某些当权人物在美国统治集团的胁迫和策动下，仍然没有放弃他们依靠美国继续进行印度支那的战争的想法。根据这种想法，法国总理拉尼埃曾提出了实质上是拒绝谈判停战的所谓“停战”条件，并且至今还在坚持这些所谓“条件”。为了按照美国的主张来取得所谓“实力地位”，法国总参谋长埃利不久以前曾到华盛顿去乞求美国的援助，并且策划继续进行印度支那的战争。最近，法国一些专好倚靠美国的人们又向美国统治集团发出紧急呼吁，要求更多的飞机、大炮和军事装备，以便加紧进行印度支那的战争。法国统治集团中的这些人的态度表明：他们虽然一方面表示愿意在即将到来的日内瓦会议上谋求印度支那问题的和平解决，但是另一方面却是把希望寄托在美国统治集团身上，企图把印度支那战争继续打下去。当然，这些人的态度与法国人民以协商方式结束印度支那战争的迫切愿望是不相符的，它是符合美国统治集团破坏日内瓦会议、扩大印度支那战争的危险要求的。
    即将到来的日内瓦会议为结束印度支那战争提供了一个起点。要实现停战、恢复和平是完全可能的，越南民主共和国胡志明主席已经表示了这样的愿望。这种愿望和法国人民与世界爱好和平人民的愿望是一致的。只有努力开好日内瓦会议，而不是跟随美国来阻挠和破坏这个会议，才有实现这种愿望的可能。
