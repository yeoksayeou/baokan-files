    People of Various Countries Welcome the Convening of the Geneva Conference
    Hope for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue and Restoration of Peace in Indochina
    Korea
    Prominent figures from all walks of life in Korea have written articles in newspapers, warmly supporting the convening of the Geneva Conference, denouncing the United States' attempts to undermine the conference, and expressing the determination of the Korean people to fight to the end for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    Jeong No-sik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, wrote that the Korean people, together with the people of the world, expect a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world, and therefore welcome and support the convening of the Geneva Conference. Disregarding this wish of the people of the world, the US imperialists are obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and planning to expand the Indochina war. The powerful force of the people of the world will not allow the US imperialists' conspiracy to succeed.
    Li Gi-yeong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean-Soviet Cultural Association, wrote that the Geneva Conference will once again confirm who are the true defenders of peace and who are the vicious enemies of peace. If the US ruling circles still have a little desire for peace, then they should show sincerity at the Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina.
    Li Yeong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Working People's Party, wrote that the only and correct path chosen by the Korean people is to solve the problem of peaceful reunification of the motherland by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference. With the broad support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people must achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland through unyielding struggle.
    Li Keu-ro, Chairman of the Korean Jianmin Association, said that today's Asia has formed a reliable fortress of peace. If the US imperialists ignore the fact that Asia is not the Asia of the past and do not learn a lesson from the failure of the Korean War, they will inevitably receive another painful lesson from the people of Asia.
    Yu Yeong-jun, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, wrote that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the cessation of the Indochina war, and the acquisition of legitimate rights by the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will help consolidate peace in Asia and make a significant contribution to the cause of world peace.
    Kim Chang-jun, Director of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, said in an article that the US imperialists vainly attempt to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, thereby continuing to maintain tension in Asia and permanently using the southern half of our country as its base for aggression. But its conspiracy will inevitably be further bankrupt.
    Czechoslovakia
    The Czechoslovak "Red Right News" published a commentary on the 23rd, saying: "A peaceful solution to the Korean issue and a truce in Indochina are the unanimous calls of our people for the Geneva Conference."
    The commentary said that the attention of peace-loving people all over the world will be focused on this conference. Because those countries that do not want war in Europe or the Far East are very concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue.
      "Red Right News" said that it is obvious that those who oppose a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and oppose the restoration of peace in Indochina are unwilling to give up their bankrupt "policy of strength," and they are conspiring to poison the atmosphere before the Geneva Conference. However, their strength is constantly disappearing, and the movement against inciting war is on the rise.
    Hungary
    The Hungarian National Peace Council sent a telegram to the representatives of the Geneva Conference, saying that we sincerely hope that the Geneva Conference will be an important step forward on the road to consultation. The telegram said that although we are European people, we cannot stand idly by when peace is threatened in any corner of the world. Therefore, we hope that issues such as the security of the entire Far East, universal disarmament, peace in Korea, and truce in Vietnam can be resolved. Our people look forward to further gains in peaceful cooperation and resolving various disputes at the Geneva Conference. We ask you to recognize your important responsibilities and do your best to ensure peace, so that our people and the people of the world can look forward to the future with confidence.
    Romania
    Romanian newspapers published articles commenting on the Geneva Conference scheduled to open on the 26th, pointing out that all people hope that this conference will take new steps to ease international tensions and consolidate peace. "Spark" newspaper called for lasting peace in Korea and demanded the unification of Korea on a democratic basis to finally resolve the Korean issue. "Spark" newspaper said: The Korean armistice is a great victory for peace-loving people. The People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have strongly demonstrated their ardent desire for peace. World public opinion recognizes that the reason why the Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully is entirely due to the United States and the Syngman Rhee group pursuing aggressive conspiracies and systematically undermining the armistice agreement.
    "Free Romania" wrote that everyone eagerly hopes that the Geneva Conference will resolve the disputes in Asia. The broadest public opinion in countries around the world has expressed its belief that the Geneva Conference will take new steps on the road to consolidating peace. The newspaper wrote that this is the first time that the five major powers and other relevant countries have held a meeting to deal with very important issues on the Asian continent. The participation of the People's Republic of China in this conference clearly shows that it is unimaginable to solve one of the most important international problems—here we are talking about the Asian issue—without the participation of the legitimate representatives of 500 million people.
    "Labor News," the organ of the Central Council of the Romanian General Trade Union, published an article on the Indochina issue, saying: Broad world public opinion eagerly hopes that at the Geneva Conference, representatives of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries will reach an agreement on a truce in Indochina, so as to establish a just peace based on the principle that the people of all countries enjoy freedom and national independence. Everyone unanimously demands that the people of Indochina not be prevented from deciding their own destiny.
    Bulgaria
    Bulgarian newspapers published editorials on the 25th welcoming the convening of the Geneva Conference.
    The "Fatherland Front News" editorial pointed out: The convening of the Geneva Conference and the joint participation of the People's Republic of China and other major powers in this conference is an indisputable achievement of the Soviet Union's peace policy. Peace-loving people all over the world are eagerly hoping that the Geneva Conference will be a firm step towards peace in Asia. The editorial said: The Bulgarian people sincerely hope that the Geneva Conference will achieve results that are in line with the interests of peace in Asia and peace in the world.
    "Labor News" published an editorial entitled "Towards New Peaceful Victories," saying: The convening of the Geneva Conference has opened the door to peaceful resolution of existing international disputes and outstanding issues through consultation. The editorial pointed out that the democratic resolution of the Korean issue and the cessation of the Indochina war are closely related to the vital interests of people all over the world. People of all countries are not only expecting, but also striving to ensure that the Geneva Conference can reach an agreement sufficient to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
    India
    The Uttar Pradesh Peace Conference in India was held in Lucknow from the 17th to the 18th. About sixty representatives from all parts of Uttar Pradesh attended the meeting.
    The meeting passed a resolution welcoming the convening of the Geneva Conference; demanding the prohibition of hydrogen bombs and other weapons of mass slaughter, and demanding the removal of US "observers" in Kashmir. The meeting condemned US military "aid" to Pakistan and called on the people of Uttar Pradesh to enthusiastically hold "Asia Day" on April 25.
    Switzerland
    Many Swiss newspapers, in commenting on the upcoming Geneva Conference, emphasized that the participation of the People's Republic of China in this major international conference will have a great impact on the conference. The "Basel News" pointed out on the 25th that the participation of the People's Republic of China alone makes this conference a historically significant event, regardless of the specific outcome of the conference. The newspaper emphasized that without China's participation, it is clear that there will be no future in dealing with Asian issues.
    West Germany
    The German People's Daily (published in Dusseldorf, West Germany), the organ of the League for German Unity, Peace and Freedom, published an article on the 24th saying: "The failure of the Geneva Conference must not be allowed." The newspaper said: "For the whole of Europe, and especially for Germany, the Geneva Conference is very important. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world, together with us, have great hopes for the Geneva Conference. They expect that at this conference, the disaster-ridden Korean people can achieve peace and unity, and the dirty war in Vietnam can end. To prevent the failure of the conference, the concerted efforts of all peace-loving people are needed."
    The newspaper quoted the West German "Westphalian Review" as saying: "If Dulles wants to greet the Geneva Conference with sensational and threatening words, we must remind him that people of all countries have never liked a politician who predicts failure from the start."

    各国人民欢迎召开日内瓦会议
    希望和平解决朝鲜问题恢复印度支那和平
    朝鲜
    朝鲜各界著名人士纷纷在报纸上撰写文章，热烈拥护日内瓦会议的召开，斥责美国破坏会议的企图，并表明朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而斗争到底的决心。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团议长郑鲁湜撰文说：朝鲜人民和全世界人民一起，期望朝鲜问题获得和平解决从而巩固远东与全世界的和平，因而都欢迎和支持日内瓦会议的召开。不顾全世界人民的这种愿望，美帝国主义者却在阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决并在策划扩大印度支那战争。全世界人民的强大力量将不容许美帝国主义者的阴谋得逞。
    朝苏文化协会中央委员会委员长李箕永撰文说：日内瓦会议必将再一次证实，谁是真正的和平保卫者，谁是和平的凶恶敌人。如果美国统治集团还具有一点和平的愿望，那么它就应该在日内瓦会议上拿出诚意来和平解决朝鲜问题并恢复印度支那的和平。
    勤劳人民党中央委员会委员长李英撰文说：朝鲜人民选择的唯一而正确的道路，就是在没有外国干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己解决和平统一祖国问题的道路。朝鲜人民在全世界爱好和平人民的广泛支持下，一定要以不屈不挠的斗争达成祖国的和平统一。
    朝鲜健民会委员长李克鲁说：今天的亚洲已形成了一个可靠的和平堡垒。如果美帝国主义者忽视亚洲已经不是过去的亚洲这一事实，不从朝鲜战争的失败中吸取教训的话，它将势必要从亚洲人民那里得到另一个惨痛的教训。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团议长刘英俊写道：朝鲜问题的和平解决、印度支那战争的停止以及中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法的权利，都将有助于巩固亚洲的和平，对维护世界和平的事业作出重大的贡献。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会书记局局长金昌俊在文章中说：美帝国主义者妄想阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，从而继续维持亚洲的紧张局势，把我们祖国的南半部永远作为它的侵略基地。但它的这种阴谋诡计必将遭到进一步的破产。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”二十三日发表评论说：“和平解决朝鲜问题以及在印度支那停战，这是我国人民对于日内瓦会议的一致的呼声。”
    评论说，全世界爱好和平的人民的注意都将集中在这一次的会议上。因为那些既不愿意欧洲发生战争、也不愿意远东发生战争的各国人民，对于和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题是非常关切的。
      “红色权利报”说，很明显，那些反对和平解决朝鲜问题以及反对在印度支那恢复和平的人们，绝不愿意放弃他们的已经破了产的“实力政策”，他们正阴谋在日内瓦会议以前毒化空气。不过他们的实力正在不断消失，而反对煽动战争的运动正在日趋高涨。
    匈牙利
    匈牙利全国和平理事会致电日内瓦会议的代表们说，我们衷心地希望日内瓦会议成为协商道路上的重要进展。电报说，虽然我们是欧洲人民，但是我们不能眼见世界任何角落的和平受到威胁而无动于衷。因此，我们希望整个远东的安全、普遍裁军、朝鲜和平以及越南停战等问题都能得到解决。我国人民盼望日内瓦会议在和平合作以及解决各种争执方面得到进一步的收获。我们要求你们认识到你们的重大责任，尽最大的努力来确保和平，那么我国人民和全世界人民就可以满怀信心地期待着将来。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚各报载文评论定于二十六日开幕的日内瓦会议，指出所有人民都希望这一会议会采取缓和国际紧张局势与巩固和平的新步骤。“火花报”要求在朝鲜实现持久和平，并要求在民主基础上统一朝鲜，以最后解决朝鲜问题。“火花报”说：朝鲜停战是爱好和平人民的一个巨大胜利。中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经有力地表现了它们要求和平的热烈愿望。世界舆论认识到：朝鲜问题所以到现在还没有得到肯定的和平解决，完全是由于美国与李承晚集团推行侵略阴谋，有计划地破坏停战协定。
    “自由罗马尼亚报”写道，大家热烈期望日内瓦会议使亚洲的争执问题得到解决。全世界各国最广泛的舆论都已经表示相信日内瓦会议将在巩固和平的道路上采取新的步骤。该报写道，五个大国与其他有关国家举行会议，来处理亚洲大陆的非常重要的问题，这还是第一次。中华人民共和国参加这个会议，清楚地说明：没有五亿人民的合法代表参加，要解决一个最重要的国际问题——这里是说亚洲问题——是不可想像的。
    罗马尼亚总工会中央理事会机关报“劳动报”发表一篇论印度支那问题的文章说：广泛的世界舆论都热烈希望：在日内瓦会议上，苏联、法国、英国、美国、中华人民共和国和其他有关国家的代表达成关于印度支那停战的协议，以便根据世界各国人民享有自由和民族独立的原则建立正义的和平。大家一致要求，不要阻挠印度支那人民决定他们自己的命运。
    保加利亚
    保加利亚报纸二十五日发表社论欢迎日内瓦会议的召开。
    “祖国阵线报”的社论指出：日内瓦会议的召开以及中华人民共和国与其他大国共同参加这次会议，是苏联和平政策所取得的无可置辩的成就。全世界爱好和平的人民都在殷切地希望：日内瓦会议将是导致亚洲和平的一个坚定的步骤。社论说：保加利亚人民衷心地希望日内瓦会议获得符合亚洲和平及全世界和平的利益的成果。
    “劳动报”以“走向新的和平胜利”为题发表社论说：日内瓦会议的召开为通过协商和平解决现有的国际争端和悬而未决的问题打开了大门。社论指出：朝鲜问题的民主解决和停止印度支那战争是与全世界人民切身利害有关的。各国人民不仅在期待，而且在争取使日内瓦会议能达成足以巩固亚洲和全世界和平的协议。
    印度
    印度北方省和平会议于十七日至十八日在勒克瑙举行。参加会议的有北方省各地代表约六十人。
    会议通过决议欢迎日内瓦会议的召开；要求禁止氢弹及其他大规模屠杀的武器，并要求撤除美国在克什米尔的“观察员”。会议斥责美国对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”，并号召北方省人民在四月二十五日热烈举行“亚洲日”。
    瑞士
    瑞士的许多报纸在评论即将到来的日内瓦会议时，都强调指出在这个大的国际会议上有中华人民共和国参加将对会议有很大影响。“巴塞尔新闻”二十五日指出：单是中华人民共和国的参加，就使得这次会议成为一次有历史意义的事件，不管会议的具体结果如何。该报强调指出：没有中国参加，要处理亚洲的问题很明显是不会有任何前途的。
    西德
    德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟机关报“德国人民报”（在西德杜塞尔多夫出版）二十四日刊载了一篇文章说：“绝不容许日内瓦会议失败。”该报说：“对于整个欧洲，尤其是对于德国来说，日内瓦会议非常重要。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民都和我们一起对于日内瓦会议寄予极大的希望。他们期望在这次会议上，饱经灾难的朝鲜人民可以得到和平与统一，在越南进行的肮脏战争可以结束。要防止会议失败，需要所有爱好和平的人民一致努力。”
    该报引用西德“威斯特伐利亚评论报”的话说：“假如杜勒斯要用耸人听闻和威胁的话来迎接日内瓦会议，我们必须提醒他：各国人民从来不喜欢一个一开始就预言失败的政客。”
