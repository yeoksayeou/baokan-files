Improving Leadership Methods in Agriculture
— Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda," March 11

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have shown great concern for the further development of socialist agriculture and the improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people. Party and Soviet organs have done a lot of work in implementing the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, creating the necessary conditions for completing the task of vigorously improving all sectors of agriculture.

Currently, based on its achievements, the Party is mobilizing the Soviet people to fight for increased agricultural production, especially for vigorously improving the grain economy. The recently concluded Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party pointed out that the current task facing our country is to drastically expand grain production. The Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government believe that, in addition to increasing the yield per unit area of all cultivated land, it is also necessary to reclaim at least 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in 1954-1955.

In the meetings between candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and voters held these days, the working people of our country expressed deep satisfaction with the program formulated by the Party for the further development of agriculture. They declared that they are ready at any time to resolutely and combatively implement various measures to drastically increase production in collective farms and state farms.

The resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party state: "The complex and extremely important tasks put forward by the Party and the government for agriculture require Party organizations and Soviet organs to conduct more skilled and in-depth leadership of all sectors of agricultural production, and require them to be good at organizing the masses to solve the fundamental problems of agricultural upsurge."

After the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, local Party organizations have begun to pay more attention to the Party's political work in rural areas. The work of district-level Party organizations has begun to be reorganized, making it closer to the production work of collective farms and state farms. However, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party pointed out that the reorganization of the organs managing agriculture and the Party's political work in rural areas is progressing extremely slowly. There is a harmful, bureaucratic working method in leading agriculture, that is, the leading staff and experts of the organs do not use their main strength to carry out specific and lively work - organizing collective farmers, machine tractor stations, and state farm staff to implement the Party and government's resolutions on further developing agriculture - but instead bury themselves in drafting countless instructions, resolutions, documents, letters, reports, and other documents that are often not needed by anyone. Some districts still arbitrarily hold various meetings and arbitrarily summon collective farm chairmen and agricultural experts to participate in meetings, separating people from lively organizational work.

Many states are also very slow to reorganize the work of the district Party committees and district executive committees, and it often becomes a formality. In many places, the machine tractor station work group of the district Party committee, headed by the district Party secretary, has not actually started work. When some Party committees form work groups, they do not pay attention to including those who are well-cultivated, understand their tasks, are familiar with collective farm production, and love Party work.

Many district Party committees still work in the old way. The district Party secretaries and instructors responsible for leading the machine tractor stations still live in the center of the district, spending most of their time in the center of the district, rarely going to the machine tractor stations and collective farms, not delving into their lives, and not providing them with the necessary assistance.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party emphasized that it is impossible to successfully advance agriculture without thoroughly improving the leadership of the collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and without greatly improving the Party's political and organizational work in rural areas. The plenary session required Party, Soviet, and agricultural organs to eradicate the harmful red tape and bureaucratic leadership methods in agriculture, reduce the exchange of forms and official documents, and establish lively connections with collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

State Party committees, border region Party committees, and central committees of the Party of various union republics have the responsibility to complete the reorganization of the work of the agricultural district Party committees in the shortest possible time. It is necessary to organize well the work of the secretaries and other staff members of the district Party committees working in the machine tractor station areas, so as to eliminate not just in form, but in reality, the phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsible for the leadership of the machine tractor stations and collective farms. The problem lies in eradicating the bureaucratic working methods and the practice of being busy with empty meetings, so that the district committee's guiding work group can carry out regular political, organizational, and cultural education work in the countryside, and get close to every collective farmer and every staff member of the machine tractor station.

District-level organizations play a significant role in leading agriculture. If this link is not strengthened with experienced cadres, it will be impossible to raise the leadership of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms to the level required by the new tasks. This work requires us to draw outstanding staff from the Party organizations and Soviet organs of states, border regions, and republics, and transfer Party and Soviet staff from cities and industrial centers to work permanently in the agricultural district Party committees and district executive committees.

Party and Soviet staff can only skillfully lead agriculture when they analyze agricultural production issues well and expertly, study and promote advanced experiences. The task facing all Party and Soviet cadres related to agricultural production is to master the basic principles of agriculture and familiarize themselves with the new production methods and techniques adopted by advanced individuals.

The further consolidation of collective farms organizationally and economically is one of the most important conditions for successfully completing the current tasks in agriculture. All collective farms in our country have unlimited potential for developing agricultural production. To fully utilize the existing potential, it is necessary to greatly improve the leadership of collective farms, strive to raise all collective farms without exception to the level of advanced farms, and pay special attention to the work of applying the experiences of advanced collective farms and agricultural production innovators to all collective farms.

The urgent task of Party and Soviet organs is to strengthen the ranks of leading cadres of collective farms, especially the chairmen of collective farms. Under the current conditions, the role of collective farm chairmen has increased immeasurably. The improvement and consolidation of the collective farm's public economy depends primarily on the chairmen of the farms. Party committees must ensure that every collective farm is led by skilled and experienced people.

The successful completion of the reclamation of virgin land depends primarily on the correct selection and dispatch of skilled leaders, engineers, technicians, and agronomists, as well as mechanical operators to the areas where new land is being reclaimed. The organized transfer and dispatch of staff to the areas where new land is being reclaimed should be regarded as an important task of the Party and the government, and as a great patriotic undertaking.

It is the responsibility of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to carry out propaganda and explanation work among rural mechanical operators, experts, and agricultural leaders, in order to attract volunteers to actively participate in the work of reclaiming new land. In this work, newspapers, radio, film, and other propaganda tools must be used.

State farms play a significant role in completing the task of drastically increasing agriculture. Local Party organizations must pay close attention to the leadership of state farms, strengthen supervision of their work, and try to consolidate them with skilled cadres.

The success of any work is determined by people. The struggle to implement the measures formulated by the Party in agriculture means, first and foremost, organizing the people, giving play to their creative initiative and enthusiasm, and supporting various initiatives conducive to completing the tasks facing agriculture.

The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party required Party organizations to resolutely strengthen political work in rural areas. Efforts must be made to ensure that all rural laborers – male and female collective farmers, workers of state farms and machine tractor stations, agricultural experts – can deeply understand the tasks of further improving agriculture and work selflessly to realize these tasks.

The task of the Party organizations' political work in rural areas is to launch a wide-ranging socialist emulation campaign, striving to vigorously improve the grain economy, striving for a bumper harvest of all crops, and striving to further increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of livestock products. We must more broadly absorb the intellectuals, teachers, doctors, agronomists, animal husbandry specialists, and engineers in our countryside to participate in our rural political work and mass cultural work. This is a huge force that can and should become the backbone of Party organizations.

Party organizations at all levels, in improving leadership methods in agriculture and strengthening organizational and political work, will be able to effectively ensure the successful completion of the various tasks formulated by the Party in developing agriculture. (Translated by Zhang Zhenya)

    改进对农业的领导方法
    ——苏联“真理报”三月十一日社论
    共产党和苏联政府对于社会主义农业的进一步发展和苏联人民生活水平的提高，表现了极大的关切。党和苏维埃机关在执行苏共中央九月全会的决议方面做了许多工作，为完成大力提高农业各部门这一任务创造了必要的条件。
    目前，党根据已有的成就，正在动员苏联人民为增加农业生产，首先是大力提高谷物经济而进行斗争。不久前闭幕的苏共中央委员会全体会议指出，目前我国所面临的任务就是要急剧扩大谷物的生产。党中央委员会和苏联政府认为除了提高一切耕地的单位面积产量以外，还必须在一九五四——一九五五年至少开垦一千三百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。
    在这些天举行的苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人和选民的会见中，我国劳动人民对于党所制订的进一步发展农业的纲领表示出深深的满意。他们宣称将随时准备坚决地、战斗地来实现急剧提高集体农庄和国营农场生产的各项措施。
    苏共中央全会的决议写道：“党和政府对农业提出的复杂而极其重要的任务，要求党组织和苏维埃机关对农业生产的一切部门进行更加十分熟练而深入的领导，并要求它们善于组织群众解决农业高涨的根本问题。”
    各地方党组织在苏共中央九月全会之后已经开始更加注意农村党的政治工作。区级党组织的工作已开始改组，从而使它更接近了集体农庄及国营农场的生产工作。但是苏共中央全体会议指出，对管理农业的机关和农村党的政治工作的改组，进行得极其缓慢。在领导农业方面有一种有害的、官僚主义的工作方法，这就是机关领导工作人员和专家没有把主要力量用来进行具体生动的工作——组织集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员执行党和政府关于进一步发展农业的决议，而是埋头于草拟无数指令、决议、文件、信件、报告和其它时常是谁都不需要的文件。一些区仍然任意举行各种会议，任意召集集体农庄主席和农业专家参加会议，使人们和生动的组织工作隔离开来。
    许多州对于改组区党委会和区执行委员会的工作，进行得也很缓慢，而且往往流于形式。在许多地方，以区党委书记为首的区党委会机器拖拉机站工作组实际上还没有着手工作。某些党委会在编工作组时，没有注意将那些修养好的、了解自己的任务的、通晓集体农庄生产的、热爱党的工作的人编在里面。
    许多区党委会仍然是以老一套的工作方法进行工作，负责领导机器拖拉机站的区党委书记和指导员仍然住在区的中心，把大部分时间花在区的中心，很少到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去，不深入它们的生活，没有给它们必要的帮助。
    苏共中央委员会全体会议强调指出，不彻底改进对各集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导，不大大地提高党在农村的政治和组织工作水平，就不可能顺利地把农业向前推进。全会要求党、苏维埃和农业机关根除对农业的有害的文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，减少表报和公文的往来，同集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场建立生动的联系。
    州党委会、边疆区党委会和各加盟共和国党中央有责任在最短期内完成改组农业区党委会的工作。必须很好地组织区党委会在机器拖拉机站地区工作的书记和其他工作人员的工作，以便不是在形式上，而是在实际上消除对机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的领导无人负责和不负责任的现象。问题在于要根绝文牍主义的工作方法和忙于空洞会议的作风，以便使区委会的指导工作组能在农村里进行经常的政治、组织和文化教育工作，去接近每一个集体农民和机器拖拉机站的每一个工作人员。
    区级组织在领导农业方面所起的作用很大。如果不用练达的干部来加强这一环节，那就不可能把对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导工作提高到新任务所要求的水平。这一工作要求我们从州、边疆区和共和国的党组织和苏维埃机关中抽出优秀的工作人员，从城市和工业中心抽出党和苏维埃的工作人员，调到农业区党委会和区执行委员会做固定工作。
    党的和苏维埃的工作人员只有在他们很好地、内行地分析农业生产问题，研究并推广先进经验时，才能熟练地领导农业。党和苏维埃的所有同农业生产有关的干部所面临的任务，就是要掌握农业的基本原理，熟悉先进者所采用的新的生产方式和方法。
    集体农庄组织上和经济上的进一步巩固，是成功地完成农业方面当前任务的最重要的条件之一。我国所有的集体农庄都拥有发展农业生产的无限潜力。为充分利用现有的潜力，就必须大大改进对集体农庄的领导，努力把所有集体农庄毫无例外地提到先进农庄的水平，对于把先进集体农庄和农业生产革新者的经验采用到全部集体农庄中去的工作，尤应特别注意。
    党和苏维埃机关的迫切任务就是要加强集体农庄领导干部、特别是集体农庄主席的阵容。在目前的条件下，集体农庄主席的作用不可估量地提高了。集体农庄公有经济的提高和巩固，首先要依靠农庄主席。党委会必须保证使每一个集体农庄都由熟练的和有经验的人来领导。
    顺利地完成生荒地的开垦工作，首先取决于正确地选拔和派遣熟练的领导人、工程师、技术人员和农艺工作者，以及机械操使人员到开垦新土地的区域中去。应当把有组织地抽调与派遣工作人员到开垦新地的区域去这一工作，当作党和政府的重要任务，当作一项伟大的爱国事业来完成。
    党、工会和青年团的责任，是在农村机械操使者、专家和农业领导干部中展开宣传解释工作，以便吸收志愿积极参加开垦新地的工作者。在这一工作中必须利用报刊、无线电、电影和其它宣传鼓动工具。
    国营农场在完成急剧提高农业的任务中起着重大的作用。地方党组织必须十分重视对国营农场的领导，加强对它们的工作的监督，并设法用熟练的干部来巩固它们。
    任何工作的成绩都是由人决定的。为实现党在农业方面所制订的措施而斗争，这首先就是指要组织人们，发挥他们的创造积极性和主动精神，支持有利于完成农业所面临的任务的各种创举。
    苏共中央全会要求党组织坚决加强农村的政治工作。必须争取使全体农村劳动者——男女集体农民、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工人、农业专家——都能深刻地了解进一步提高农业的任务，并忘我地为实现这些任务而工作。
    党组织在农村的政治工作任务就是要掀起广泛的社会主义竞赛，争取大力提高谷物经济，争取全部农作物丰收、争取进一步增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜产品的生产率。必须更广泛地吸收我们农村中的知识分子、教师、医生、农艺师、饲畜师、工程师参加我们农村的政治工作和群众文化工作。这是一支巨大的力量，它能够而且应当成为党组织的支柱。
    各级党组织在改进对农业的领导方法、加强组织和政治工作中，将能够切实保证顺利完成党在发展农业方面所制订的各项任务。（张振亚译）
