The Party and Government Cadres of the Provincial and Municipal Organs of Shaanxi and Other Provinces Study the Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee

[Our newspaper dispatch] Party members and cadres of the provincial and municipal directly affiliated organs of the Party and government in Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, as well as in Xi'an municipality, began studying the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and other documents in March. Before the start of the study, the responsible comrades of the Party organizations in the provincial and municipal organs gave mobilization reports. The Shaanxi provincial and Xi'an municipal organs combined the above documents with the first and fifth parts of the "Outline for Studying and Propagating the General Line" for in-depth study. The Qinghai provincial organs also adopted the form of study assistance groups, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, with branch committee members and responsible Party members specifically dividing the work to be responsible for the study.

Through this period of study, both leading cadres and general Party cadres have realized the importance of strengthening Party unity and strengthening Party leadership in the transition period to ensure the thorough victory of the general line; they have also realized that arrogance, complacency, liberalism, decentralism, and all erroneous thoughts and behaviors that hinder Party unity, hinder the Party's unified leadership, and undermine the Party's principle of collective leadership are harmful to the Party's cause. On the basis of increased understanding, everyone carried forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, universally examined their own mistakes and shortcomings, criticized arrogance and complacency, and expressed that in future work and all actions, they would strive to strengthen Party unity. In particular, many responsible Party cadres in the Xi'an municipal organs took the lead in conducting self-criticism in their own units in light of the spirit of the documents, humbly accepted criticism from others, and promoted serious self-criticism among general Party cadres, making the study more effective. For example, Sun Zhongjia, a staff member of the Jiefang Road office of the Xi'an Municipal People's Bank, said: "I used to think that I was a high school student with a high level of education, so I was arrogant and complacent, and looked down on some leading comrades with 'poor ability.' Now I realize that arrogance, complacency, and disharmony only benefit the enemy, harm the Party and the people, and will even ruin my personal future, which really startled me. In the future, I guarantee to constantly improve my awareness and overcome this shortcoming."

    气象台预告大风消息
    据新华社讯：中央气象台十四日下午八时发布大风消息：预计十五日内蒙古自治区中部、东北南部的平原地区和热河省，将有六级左右的西南风；黄海南部、东海北部、浙江沿海和江苏沿海地区，将有六级左右的偏东风；鄱阳湖、洞庭湖地区将有六级左右的偏北风。陕西等省市级机关干部学习四中全会决议
    【本报讯】陕西、青海省级及西安市级各党、政直属机关的党员、干部，于三月间开始学习中共七届四中全会决议等文件。学习开始前，各省、市级机关的党员负责同志都作了动员报告。陕西省级和西安市级机关，都把以上文件结合着“总路线学习和宣传提纲”的第一、第五部分进行深入的学习。青海省级机关并采取了学习互助小组的形式，在党支部的统一领导下，由支委及党员负责同志具体分工负责，进行学习。
    通过这一时期的学习，不论领导干部或一般党员干部，都认识到在过渡时期，加强党的团结和加强党的领导对于保证总路线彻底胜利的重要意义；也认识到骄傲自满情绪、自由主义、分散主义以及一切妨碍党的团结、妨碍党的统一领导、破坏党的集体领导原则的错误思想和行为，对党的事业的危害性。在认识提高的基础上，大家都发扬了批评与自我批评的精神，普遍地检查了自己的错误和缺点，批判了骄傲自满情绪，并表示今后在工作和一切行动中，要为加强党的团结而奋斗。特别是西安市级机关的许多党员负责干部，在学习过程中对照文件精神，带头在本单位作了自我检讨，虚心地接受旁人的批评，推动一般党员干部进行了严肃的自我批评，学习的效果更加显著。如西安市人民银行解放路办事处工作人员孙仲葭说：“我以前认为自己是高中学生，文化程度高，骄傲自满，对一些‘能力差’的领导同志瞧不起，现在认识到骄傲自满、闹不团结，只有利于敌人，而有害于党和人民，发展下去还要毁掉我个人前途，真使我大吃一惊。今后我保证不断地提高自己的觉悟，克服这一缺点。”
