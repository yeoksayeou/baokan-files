    I. Close Planting of Rice Can Increase Yield

    Most rice-producing areas promoted the advanced experience of close planting of rice last year, with Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces promoting it on a relatively large scale. The results of trials, demonstrations, and promotion in these areas have proven that appropriate close planting based on the original sparse planting can significantly increase yield. The results of trials in 21 farms in Jiangxi Province showed that, under existing cultivation conditions, reducing the spacing between hills and rows to 6-7 inches to 8-9 inches could increase production by an average of 30%. A comparative test by 17 farmers in Guomen Village, Shangrao County, also proved that, under the same cultivation conditions, appropriate close planting increased production by 70 to 140 jin per mu compared to the original sparse planting. The results of trials in 471 key townships, cooperatives, and groups in Hunan Province showed that appropriate close planting increased production by at least 10%, and in some cases by 34%, with an average increase of 17%. In Changshou County, Sichuan Province, 80% of farmers reduced the spacing between hills and rows by 1 to 4 inches based on the original sparse planting and improved other technologies, increasing rice production in the county by about 18%. Last year, more than 70,000 mu of rice fields in Wuyi County, Zhejiang Province, adopted a hill and row spacing of about 9 inches, all of which increased production by 20% to 30%. In Luoyuan County, Fujian Province, 80% of the area reduced the hill and row spacing by 2 to 3 inches, and the county's early rice production increased by 18.5%.

    However, there were also cases of reduced production due to the promotion of close planting of rice in some areas last year. Some areas called for "small seedlings and close planting" and "fewer seedlings and close planting," but failed to clearly explain the scientific principles and specific methods of close planting to the masses, one-sidedly emphasizing "small seedlings" or "fewer seedlings." As a result, although the number of planting hills increased, the total number of seedlings greatly decreased, and close planting became sparse planting. For example, in the Longxi Special District Farm in Fujian Province, although the hill and row spacing was reduced by 2 to 3 inches when promoting close planting of rice, the number of seedlings per hill was reduced from more than 10 to 3 or 4. Some areas mistakenly believed that "closer is better, the closer the better," and blindly over-planted. Some reduced the hill and row spacing of rice plants but did not simultaneously adjust the number of seedlings planted per hill, resulting in "large seedlings and close planting." All these unreasonable close planting methods not only failed to achieve the desired results but even led to reduced production.

    II. Further Promote Close Planting of Rice

    First, the general planting density of rice in our country is relatively sparse, and the yield is generally low. Currently, the planting hill spacing in most single-season indica rice areas is 1 to 1.8 chi, the row spacing is 8-9 cun to 1.5-1.6 chi, and each mu generally has 4,000 to 7,000 hills, with fewer areas having around 3,000 hills. The planting density of japonica rice is also generally inappropriate. For example, in some areas of Jiangsu, the medium-grained japonica rice generally has only about 10,000 hills per mu, and the late-season japonica rice in the Taihu Lake basin still has only 8,000 hills per mu. It can be seen that rice planting in our country generally has wide hill and row spacing and fewer planting hills per mu, which limits the increase in yield. According to the advanced experience of Soviet agricultural production, small-plant crops such as rice have a certain limit to the development of single plants and single ears. To obtain high yields, it is necessary to ensure that there are enough plants per unit area. Therefore, promoting appropriate close planting has become the most economical and effective measure to increase the yield per unit area of rice.

    Second, close planting is a practical and feasible method at present. Because close planting mainly aims to eliminate the unreasonable phenomenon of wide hill and row spacing and excessive number of seedlings planted per hill, so that plants are evenly distributed and fully utilize land fertility. Therefore, it can be adopted in areas with high or low cultivation levels and good or bad cultivation conditions.

    Third, some people believe that close planting will result in poor ventilation and light transmission, which can easily cause lodging. Scientific experiments have proven that reasonable and appropriate close planting will not cause lodging, because appropriate close planting increases the total number of panicles and makes the panicles uniform. This not only greatly increases yield, but also limits the tillering of single plants to a certain extent, so it will not cause lodging due to excessive tillering, dense plants, and affecting ventilation and light transmission. For example, the results of the Qu County Farm experiment in Zhejiang Province showed that with a hill and row spacing of 1 chi and 6,000 hills planted per mu, the average tillering per hill was 20, but the effective tillering rate was only 75%, and the total number of plants per mu was only more than 90,000, with a yield of 460 jin per mu; with a hill and row spacing of 6 cun and more than 16,000 hills planted per mu, the average tillering per hill was only 10.6, but the effective tillering rate reached 100%, the total number of panicles per mu was more than 176,000, and the yield per mu was 609 jin. This proves that although the total number of plants increases after close planting, the number of tillers per plant decreases relatively, and therefore will not cause lodging. Experience has shown that the main causes of lodging are unreasonable irrigation, fertilization, and excessive close planting. For example, in the Jiangsu Rice Experiment Farm, medium-grain japonica rice with a hill spacing of 7 cun and a row spacing of 8 cun, and with a hill and row spacing of 5 cun for close planting, did not lodge under shallow and frequent irrigation, but caused lodging in deep irrigation areas. In 1953, all "high-yield fields" in Shaomao Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, generally reduced production. The main reasons for the reduction in production were excessive close planting (such as some planting 25,000 to 50,000 hills per mu) and excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer (such as Xu Shaoyin, a farmer in the 16th electoral district, applied 70 dan of basal fertilizer black manure, 130 jin of soybean cake, 8 dan of topdressing manure, 50 jin of soybean cake, and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate to more than 9 fen of "high-yield fields," resulting in complete lodging before the milky stage).

    Fourth, some difficulties in labor allocation and mid-cultivation weeding caused by close planting can be overcome. In areas where close planting of rice was promoted last year, with the appropriate increase in the number of planting hills per mu, the labor required for transplanting and harvesting also increased slightly. However, due to the large-scale organization of temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance, rational allocation of labor, and increased labor efficiency in various places, the labor difficulties during the busy farming season were overcome. In the future, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the need to increase labor due to the implementation of close planting can be resolved. Although close planting reduces the hill and row spacing, there is still a certain distance between the hills and rows under appropriate close planting, so weeding can be carried out, and the original weeding tools can generally still be used without being affected. If the weeding tools are too large, they can be appropriately reduced. Farmers in areas where close planting of rice was promoted in Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province, and Songyang County, Zhejiang Province, last year appropriately reduced the size of the weeding harrows.

    Fifth, all localities have experience in increasing production through close planting, which can be obtained and promoted locally. For example, in western Hunan Province, there are sayings such as "sparse plowing and sparse planting is for lazy people, dense plowing and dense planting brings great harvest," "7 cun rows, 8 cun hills," and "8 cun rows, 8 roots per hill." Sichuan Province was originally a sparse planting area, but Wang Dexuan, a farmer in Silixiang, Er District, Xuyong County, has been practicing close planting for more than ten years. His close-planted fields generally yield more than 20% more than sparse-planted fields. The rice planting density in various parts of our country is very inconsistent. Even within a village, there are various planting densities, some of which are more reasonable and some of which are unreasonable. As long as the reasonable parts can be carefully summarized and improved, they can become the basis for promotion.

    III. Issues to Note When Promoting Close Planting of Rice

    First, when promoting close planting of rice, it is necessary to adopt a positive and steady approach, preventing any hasty, rash, coercive, or mandatory practices, and opposing any laissez-faire or conservative attitudes. While the masses have a certain limit to the acceptance of new technologies, it must be recognized that due to the widespread development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production, as long as they are good at using practical examples of increasing production through close planting, relying on agricultural production cooperatives and well-established mutual aid groups, and making good typical demonstrations, the masses will quickly promote it once they see the benefits of close planting with their own eyes. When promoting close planting of rice, it is necessary to be good at discussing with the masses and proposing simple and easy-to-implement methods. For example, the Guilin Special District in Guangxi Province proposed the "six hills plus one hill" close planting method, which the masses thought was feasible.

    Second, the density of rice planting should be determined based on the farmers' original cultivation experience and the results of local trials and demonstrations, and should not be subjectively unified. Experience over the past year has proven that in the southern indica rice areas, reducing the hill and row spacing to 7, 8, or 9 cun on the basis of the original sparse planting generally has better yield-increasing effects. However, due to different climates, varieties, cultivation systems, and cultivation conditions in various places, the appropriate planting density should not be the same. For example, in the early and mid-season indica rice areas of Jiangxi, reducing the hill and row spacing to 7 or 8 cun; in the early and mid-season indica rice areas of northern Jiangsu, reducing the hill and row spacing to 5 or 6 cun; in the late-season indica rice areas of Fujian, reducing the hill and row spacing to 8 to 10 cun; in the mid- and late-season japonica rice areas in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, reducing the hill and row spacing to 6 or 7 cun; in the double-cropping intercropping rice areas in Zhejiang, reducing the hill and row spacing to 7 cun and 1.2 chi; and in the double-cropping intercropping rice areas in Hunan, reducing the hill and row spacing to 1.2 or 1.3 chi, have all achieved significant yield increases. Various localities can study and promote locally feasible close planting methods based on local natural conditions, variety characteristics, cultivation levels, and mass habits. The general principle of sparseness and density is: areas with lower temperatures, weaker tillering ability of varieties, more fertile soil, and better cultivation conditions can have a higher degree of close planting, and vice versa.

    Third, to implement close planting of rice, it is necessary to master the scientific principles of close planting. The principle of rational close planting is: on the premise of increasing the total number of plants per mu and ensuring that each plant has a certain nutritional area, appropriately reduce the hill and row spacing, increase the number of planting hills, and appropriately adjust the number of seedlings planted per hill, so as to achieve balanced plant development, neat and robust growth, more panicles and more grains, and increased yield. Therefore, in areas where "large seedlings and sparse planting" was originally adopted, the number of seedlings planted per hill reached 20 or 30. After increasing the number of planting hills, the number of seedlings planted per hill should be appropriately reduced according to different varieties, climates, and soil fertility to prevent the deviation of "large seedlings and close planting" from occurring. On the other hand, attention should also be paid to preventing the deviation of increasing the number of hills per mu by a small amount, while greatly reducing the number of seedlings planted per hill, so that close planting becomes sparse planting. Close planting is only to achieve a rational planting density, not "closer is better," "the closer the better." Therefore, in areas where planting was originally very dense, there is no need to blindly advocate close planting, but attention should be paid to studying the appropriate hill and row spacing and the appropriate number of seedlings planted, improving cultivation techniques, and further exerting the effect of increasing production through close planting.

    Fourth, when promoting close planting, it is necessary to guide the masses to carry out a series of technical improvements. First, strong seedlings must be cultivated. If the seedlings grow weakly, the purpose of increasing production through close planting will not be achieved due to seedling death and missing seedlings after transplanting. Second, deep plowing must be implemented. Third, the amount of fertilizer should be appropriately increased after close planting due to the increase in the number of plants per unit area. Fourth, in the case of high fertilizer and dense planting, it is also necessary to select fertilizer-resistant and non-lodging high-yield varieties. In addition, attention should also be paid to rational irrigation and drainage, timely mid-cultivation weeding, and efforts to prevent various natural disasters such as water, drought, diseases, and insects.

    继续推广水稻密植，提高水稻产量
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
      一、水稻密植可以提高产量
    大部水稻产区在去年都推行了水稻密植的先进经验，其中以四川、贵州、浙江、福建等省推广的面积较大。这些地区的试验、示范和推广的结果证明：在原来稀植的基础上，适当密植，就能显著提高产量。江西省二十一个农场试验结果，在现有耕作条件下，穴、行距缩小到六、七寸到八、九寸，平均能增产百分之三十。该省上饶县郭门村十七户农民用对比法试验，也证明在同样耕作条件下，适当密植比原来稀植的每亩增产七十斤到一百四十斤。湖南省四百七十一个重点乡、社、组的试验结果，证明适当密植至少增产一成，多的增产百分之三十四，平均增产百分之十七。四川省长寿县有百分之八十的农民在原来稀植基础上，缩小穴、行距一到四寸，并改进了其他技术，全县水稻增产百分之十八左右。浙江省武义县去年有七万多亩水稻田采用了九寸左右的穴、行距，都增产二到三成。福建省罗源县有百分之八十的地区，缩小穴、行距二到三寸，全县早稻增产百分之十八点五。
    但是，去年有些地区也有因推广水稻密植，造成减产的事实。有些地区号召“小株密植”，“少秧密栽”，但是没有把密植的科学道理和具体方法向群众交代清楚，片面强调了“小株”或“少秧”，结果插植穴数虽有增加，总株数却大大减少，密植反而成了稀植。如福建省龙溪专区农场，推广水稻密植，穴、行距虽缩小了二、三寸，但每穴株数却由原来十株以上减少到三、四株。有些地区，错误地认为“密了便好，愈密愈好”，有的盲目地过分密植，有的缩小了水稻植株的穴、行距，但没有同时适当调整每穴插秧株数，结果变成了“大株密植”。所有这些不合理的密植不但不能收到应有的效果，甚至造成减产。
    二、进一步推行水稻密植
    首先，我国水稻一般栽植密度较稀，产量普遍较低。目前大部单季籼稻地区的栽植穴距是一尺到
  一尺八寸，行距八、九寸到一尺五、六寸，每亩一般插四、五千穴至六、七千穴，少的插三千穴左右，栽植较密的只有少数地区。粳稻的插植密度，一般也不适当，如江苏部分地区的中粳稻，每亩一般仅插秧一万穴左右，太湖流域的晚粳稻，每亩还有插八千穴的。由此可见，我国水稻种植，一般都是穴、行距较宽，每亩插植穴数较少，因而限制了产量的提高。根据苏联农业生产的先进经验，水稻等小株作物，单株单穗的发育有一定限度，要获得高的产量，必须保证单位面积内有足够的植株数。因此，推行适当密植就成了当前提高水稻单位面积产量最经济而有效的措施。
    第二、密植是当前切实可行的办法。因为密植主要是要消除目前栽植的穴、行距较宽，每穴插植株数过多的不合理现象，使植株均匀分布，充分利用地力。因此无论耕作水平高低，栽培条件好坏的地区都可以采用。
    第三、有人认为密植后通风透光不好，容易引起倒伏。科学的试验证明，合理的、适当的密植，不会造成倒伏，因为适当密植后，总穗数增多，穗头齐一，不仅可以大大提高产量，而且单株分蘖受到了一定限制，所以不会因分蘖过多，植株密集，影响通风透光而倒伏。例如浙江省衢县农场试验结果，穴、行距十寸，每亩插六千穴的，每穴平均分蘖有二十个，但有效分蘖率只有百分之七十五，每亩总株数只有九万多棵，每亩产量四百六十斤；穴、行距六寸，每亩插一万六千多穴的，每穴平均仅有十点六个分蘖，而有效分蘖率达到百分之百，每亩总穗数有十七万六千多个，每亩产量六百零九斤。证明密植后总株数虽然增加，但每一植株的分蘖数却相对地减少，因而不会引起倒伏。经验证明，造成倒伏的主要原因是不合理的灌溉、施肥和密植过度。例如江苏省稻作试验场中粳稻穴距七寸，行距八寸稀植的，和穴、行距五寸密植的，在浅水勤灌的情况下，都没有倒伏，而深水灌溉区，则都引起了倒伏。湖北省浠水县纱帽乡一九五三年所有“丰产田”普遍减产。减产的主要原因是密植过度（如有的每亩植到二万五千穴至五万穴）和施用氮肥过多（如十六选区农民徐绍银，在九分多“丰产田”内上了基肥黑粪七十担，豆饼一百三十斤，追肥大粪八担，豆饼五十斤，硫酸铵十斤，结果不到乳熟期，就全部倒伏）。
    第四、密植后在劳力调配及中耕耘耥上产生的一些困难是可以克服的。去年推行水稻密植的地区，随着每亩插秧穴数的适当增加，插秧和收割所费的人工，亦略有增加，但因各地都大量地组织了临时变工互助，合理调配劳动力，提高了劳动效率，克服了农忙季节的人工困难。今后随着互助合作运动的开展，因实行密植而需要增加劳力是可以解决的。密植虽然缩小了穴、行距，但在适当密植的情况下，穴、行间还有一定的距离，可以进行耘耥，原有耘田工具一般仍然可以适用，不受影响。如果发生耘耥工具过大，可以适当改小，江苏省金山县和浙江省松阳县去年推行水稻密植地区的农民，都适当改小了耘耙。
    第五、各地都有密植增产的经验，可以就地取材就地推广。如湖南省湘西有“稀犁稀插懒人话，密犁密插收成大”，“七寸行子、八寸兜”，“行行八寸，兜兜八根”等说法。四川省原是一个稀植的地区，但叙永县二区撕栗乡农民王德宣，十几年来就一直实行密植，他的密植田一般比稀植的多收二成多。我国各地水稻插植密度是很不一致的，即在一乡一村内，也有各种不同的插植密度，其中有比较合理的，也有不合理的，只要能够认真总结合理的部分并加以提高，就可以成为推广的依据。
    三、推行水稻密植应注意问题
    第一、推行水稻密植，必须采取积极的稳步的方针，既要防止任何急躁冒进强迫命令的作法，也要反对放任自流或保守不前的态度。群众对新技术的接受，固然还有一定限度，但必须认识：由于互助合作运动的广泛发展，农民生产积极性的提高，只要善于运用密植增产的实际事例，依靠农业生产合作社及有基础的互助组，作好典型示范，使群众亲眼看到密植的好处，就能很快推广。在推行水稻密植时，要善于和群众研究，提出简而易行的办法。如广西省桂林专区提出“六兜加一兜”的密植办法，群众认为可行。
    第二、水稻插植的密度，应根据农民原有的栽培经验和各地试验示范的结果来决定，不能主观地加以统一规定。一年来的经验证明，南方籼稻地区，在原来稀植的基础上，缩小穴、行距到七、八、九寸的，增产效果一般较好，但由于各地气候、品种、栽培制度和耕作条件不同，插植的适宜密度也不应一样。如江西早中籼稻地区，缩小穴、行距到七、八寸，苏北早中籼稻缩小穴、行距到五、六寸，福建晚籼稻缩小穴、行距到八至十寸，在长江下游中晚粳稻缩小穴、行距到六、七寸，在浙江双季间作稻缩小穴、行距到七寸及一尺二寸，在湖南双季间作缩小穴、行距到一尺二、三寸，都获得显著增产效果。各地可根据当地自然条件、品种特性、耕作水平及群众习惯，研究和推广当地切实可行的密植办法。稀密的原则一般是：凡气温较低，品种分蘖力较弱，土壤较肥沃，耕作条件较好的，密植的程度可以高些，反之则应该低些。
    第三、实行水稻密植，必须掌握密植的科学道理。合理密植的原则是：在增加每亩总株数和保证每一植株有一定营养面积的前提下，适当缩小穴、行距，增加插植穴数，并适当调整每穴插植株数，以达到植株发育均衡，生长整齐健壮，穗多粒多，产量提高的目的。因此，原来采用“大株稀植”的地区，每穴插植株数达到二、三十株，在增加插植穴数后，每穴插植株数应根据品种、气候、及土壤肥力不同，适当减少，防止发生“大株密植”的偏向；另一方面也应注意防止每亩穴数增加不多，而每穴插植株数却大为减少，使密植变为稀植的偏向。密植只是为了要达到合理的插植密度，不是
  “密了便好”，“愈密愈好”。因此，在原来插植很密的地区，就无需盲目提倡密植，而应注意研究适宜的穴、行距及适宜的插植株数，提高耕作栽培技术，进一步发挥密植增产效果。
    第四、推行密植时，必须指导群众，进行一系列的技术改进工作。首先要培育壮秧，如果秧苗生长衰弱，移植后因死秧缺秧，就达不到密植增产的目的。其次要实行深耕。第三，密植后由于单位面积上株数增多，应适当增施肥料。第四，在多肥密植情况下，并须选用耐肥、不倒伏的丰产品种。此外，还要注意合理地灌溉、排水，适时中耕耘耥，努力防治水、旱、病、虫等各种自然灾害。
