"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
Introduction to the Thirteenth Issue, 1954, Chinese Edition

The thirteenth issue, 1954, Chinese edition, of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!," the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "The Communist and Workers' Parties are the Vanguard of the People's Democratic Countries." The editorial points out: The Communist and Workers' Parties in the People's Democratic countries have gained high prestige among the masses of the people and are recognized as the leading force in the struggle for socialist construction. This year, a particularly significant event for the life of the Communist and Workers' Parties is that the Communist and Workers' Parties in these countries are preparing and holding party congresses one after another. At their respective congresses, the Communist and Workers' Parties are demonstrating themselves to be stronger, more united, and more militant than before. Based on the achievements already made in socialist construction, the Party has put forward new tasks to the entire Party and the working people. The most important of these is to ensure further achievements in socialist construction, to rapidly and comprehensively develop agriculture, to greatly increase the production of daily necessities, to further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, to continuously improve the welfare of the working people, and to strengthen the people's democratic regime and national defense. However, it is impossible to successfully complete the great task of socialist construction in the People's Democratic countries without further strengthening the Communist and Workers' Parties themselves. The editorial emphasizes that the strength of the Communist and Workers' Parties lies in the rock-solid unity of their ranks. Now, the Communists in the People's Democratic countries are striving to enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, strengthen the unity of their ranks, strengthen their ties with the people, unswervingly implement the norms of inner-party life stipulated by Lenin, and continuously enhance the prestige of the Communist and Workers' Parties—the vanguard of the working people in the People's Democratic countries—in the struggle to build a socialist society and strive for peace.

This issue contains an abstract of the report "On Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land" made by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the February Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, and an article by Hannar, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Austria, entitled "Struggle for Austria's Independence and Democracy."

Khrushchev's report first summarized the implementation of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year. He pointed out: From the September Plenary Session to the present, it has been mainly a period of creating conditions for agriculture to achieve rapid upsurge in the near future. We have done a lot of work in this regard. The issue of increasing agricultural production has attracted the attention of all organizations and staff.

Most cadres have realized the urgency of the tasks put forward by the Party and are launching an increasingly broad struggle to complete these tasks. However, grain production is the foundation of the entire agricultural production. The level of grain production largely determines the development of all other agricultural sectors.

Our task is to greatly increase the total harvest of grain in the next two years. In addition to increasing the per-unit yield of all collective farms and state farms in the country, the main, most reliable, and fastest way to increase grain production is to expand the grain planting area, that is, to reclaim virgin and fallow land. Khrushchev said: Reclaiming 13 million hectares of new land in the eastern and southeastern regions is only the beginning of this great work of further expanding the planting area. In the next two years, we will also prepare to reclaim large areas of new land that are more difficult to develop in the east. We also need to reclaim river flats, swamps, and grasslands and pastures with very little grass on a large scale in the central and northwestern regions. Khrushchev then made a detailed analysis of the major issues of expanding grain production and reclaiming new land, and put forward measures and suggestions for improving the work.

Hannar's article points out: The successors of Hitler fascism are preparing for a third world war. In their plans, Austria is arranged to be an important position as an "advanced base" and a military springboard. Therefore, the struggle of the peaceful and progressive forces in Austria to prevent Austria from becoming a victim of the war economy and militarist policy of the Western powers, and to ensure Austria's neutrality and national independence, is not only in the interests of the Austrian people, but also conducive to the peaceful development of Europe. The Austrian Communists, as the loyal sons and daughters of the Austrian people, while fulfilling their proletarian internationalist responsibilities, lead and organize this struggle. The main slogan of the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Austria, scheduled to be held in May, will be to further strive for Austria's independence, oppose the threat of West German militarism, and strive for Austria to implement a policy of neutrality, democracy and peace.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第十三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十三期已经出版。
    本期以“共产党和工人党是人民民主国家的先锋队”为题发表社论。社论指出：人民民主国家的共产党和工人党在人民群众中已有了崇高的威信，是在社会主义建设的斗争中被大家公认的领导力量。今年对于共产党和工人党的生活具有特殊重大意义的事件，就是这些国家的共产党和工人党纷纷筹备和举行党代表大会。共产党和工人党在自己的代表大会上表现得比从前更坚强、更团结、更有战斗力。党根据社会主义建设的既得成就，向全党和劳动人民提出了新的任务。其中最重要的就是保证在社会主义建设中获得进一步的成就，迅速而全面地发展农业，大量增加日用品生产，进一步加强工农联盟，不断增进劳动人民的福利，加强人民民主政权和国防力量。但是，如果不进一步加强共产党和工人党本身，要在人民民主国家胜利完成社会主义建设的伟大任务是不可能的。社论强调说：共产党和工人党的力量在于它们队伍的磐石般的团结。现在，各人民民主国家的共产主义者都在努力提高党的战斗力，加强自己队伍的团结，加强自己和人民的联系，坚持不渝地实行列宁所规定的党内生活的准则，在建设社会主义社会和争取和平的斗争中不断提高共产党和工人党——人民民主国家劳动人民的先锋队——的威望。
    本期刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在党中央委员会二月全体会议上所作的“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的报告的摘要，和奥地利共产党政治局委员杭纳尔的“为奥地利的独立民主而斗争”的文章。
    赫鲁晓夫的报告首先综述了苏共中央去年九月全体会议决议的执行情况。他指出：从九月全会到现在，主要是为农业在不久的将来获得迅速高涨创造条件的时期。在这方面我们已做了很多工作。增加农业生产的问题已引起所有的组织和工作人员的注意。
    大部分干部都已认识到党提出的任务的迫切性，并为完成这些任务展开日益广泛的斗争。但是，谷物生产是整个农业生产的基础。谷物生产的水平在极大程度上决定其他所有农业部门的发展。
    我们的任务是在今后两年大大增加谷物的总收获量。除了提高全国所有集体农庄和国营农场的单位面积产量外，增加谷物生产的主要的、最可靠和最迅速的办法就是扩大谷物播种面积，即开垦生荒地和熟荒地。赫鲁晓夫说：在东部和东南部地区开垦一千三百万公顷的新地，还只是进一步扩大播种面积这一巨大工作的开端。在今后两年内，我们还要准备在东部开垦大片困难较多的新地。我们还要在中部和西北部各地区大规模开垦河滩地、沼泽地以及长草很少的草地和牧场。赫鲁晓夫接着就扩大谷物生产和开垦新地的各项重大的问题作了详尽的分析，并提出了改进工作的措施和意见。
    杭纳尔的文章指出：希特勒法西斯主义的继承者正在准备第三次世界大战。在他们的计划中奥地利被安排在作为“前进据点”和军事跳板的重要地位。因此，奥地利和平进步力量为使奥地利不致成为西方大国的战争经济和军国主义政策的牺牲品、为确保奥地利的中立和民族独立而进行斗争，不但符合奥地利人民的利益，而且有利于欧洲的和平发展。奥地利共产党人作为奥地利人民的忠实儿女，同时履行着自己的无产阶级国际主义者的职责，领导和组织了这一个斗争。定于五月间召开的奥地利共产党第十六次代表大会的主要口号，将是进一步争取奥地利的独立，反对西德军国主义的威胁，争取奥地利实行中立、民主与和平的政策。
