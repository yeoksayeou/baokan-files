The Xisi District People's Government of Beijing
Builds a Bathhouse for the Working People

　　The bathhouse built by the Xisi District People's Government of Beijing in the Xinjiekou North area, a densely populated area of ​​working people, officially opened on April 1st.

　　This bathhouse is a symbol of the honor of the people of Beijing. During the Patriotic Health Campaign in 1952, Beijing was rated as a Class B National Hygiene Model City and received a bonus of 2.5 billion yuan. In order to use this bonus for the working people, the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee consulted with various districts and obtained the approval of the Municipal People's Government. It was decided to use the bonus to build five bathhouses in the Xisi, Dongsi, Chongwen, Xuanwu, and Jingxi districts where there were more working people and poor sanitary conditions, in order to improve the health conditions of the working people.

　　The bathhouse in Xisi District was designed by the Municipal Sanitary Engineering Bureau and constructed by the district government's construction engineering team, and is operated by the district supply and marketing cooperative after completion. During the construction process, the workers regarded undertaking this project as a glorious task. They guaranteed the quality of the project and shortened the completion period; the project cost also did not exceed the budget.

　　The design of the bathhouse took into account the convenience of the masses and met hygiene requirements. The entire bathhouse covers an area of ​​301 square meters, and includes men's and women's bathrooms, cloakrooms, barbershops, disinfection rooms, rest rooms, and staff dormitories. The men's bathroom has seventeen shower heads and the women's bathroom has thirteen shower heads, all equipped with hot and cold water pipes. The cloakroom has thirty-two lockers for individual use by each bather (lockable). The rooms are all equipped with heating.

　　Before liberation, there were sewage pits and garbage dumps everywhere here; now the face of the area has been fundamentally changed. The People's Government has not only established a bathhouse here, but also built a movie theater and clinic that can accommodate more than 800 people.

### 北京西四区人民政府  为劳动人民修建一所淋浴室

    北京西四区人民政府
    为劳动人民修建一所淋浴室
    首都西四区人民政府在新街口北劳动人民聚居地区修建的一所淋浴室，已于四月一日正式开幕。
    这所淋浴室是北京市人民荣誉的象征。一九五二年爱国卫生运动中，北京市被评为全国乙等卫生模范城市，得奖金二十五亿元。为了把这笔奖金用于劳动人民，市爱国卫生运动委员会与各区协议，并取得市人民政府的同意，决定用奖金在西四、东四、崇文、宣武和京西等五区劳动人民较多、卫生条件较差的地区修建淋浴室五所，来改善劳动人民的卫生状况。
    西四区的淋浴室，由市卫生工程局设计，区人民政府的建筑工程队负责施工，竣工后交由区供销合作社负责经营。在施工过程中，工人们都把担负这项工程当作一项光荣的任务。他们保证了工程质量，缩短了竣工期限；工程费用也未超过预算。
    淋浴室的设计，处处考虑到对群众的方便，并合于卫生要求。全浴室占地三百零一平方公尺，里面设有男女浴室、更衣室、理发室、消毒室、休息室和职工宿舍。男浴室有十七个喷头，女浴室有十三个喷头，都装设冷热水管。更衣室内设有三十二个衣柜，供每个浴者单独使用（可上锁）。屋内都装有暖气设备。
    解放前，这里到处是污水坑，垃圾堆；现在已根本改变了面貌。人民政府不但在这里设立了淋浴室，还修建了能容八百多人的电影院和门诊部。
