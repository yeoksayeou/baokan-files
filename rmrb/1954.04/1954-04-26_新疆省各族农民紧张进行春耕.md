Farmers of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang Province Tensely Carry Out Spring Plowing

The spring sowing work in various parts of Xinjiang has entered a tense stage. On every oasis along the edges of the Tarim and Junggar Basins, the labor songs of farmers of all ethnic groups, both men and women, are heard everywhere. Tractors, plowing oxen, and horses are busily plowing and harrowing. The spring wheat sowing in most parts of southern Xinjiang has been completed, and other crops are now being cultivated. Hotan Prefecture completed the sowing of 550,000 mu of spring wheat in late March and is now sowing cotton and corn. In northern Xinjiang, except for some mountainous areas in Altay and Tacheng Prefectures, plowing has generally begun in other areas. In Turpan, where spring sowing started early, the sowing of spring wheat has been completed, and cotton is now being planted. Farmers in the nine counties of Urumqi Prefecture and in parts of Yili, Tacheng, and Hami Prefectures are currently sowing spring wheat. The early-sown spring wheat has already sprouted, and all winter wheat has also turned green. In northern Xinjiang, winter wheat seedlings are generally five to six centimeters high with more than three tillers. In southern Xinjiang, in Aksu, Shache, and other prefectures, wheat seedlings are generally nine to fifteen centimeters high, and some have begun to joint.

The spring plowing work in Xinjiang Province this year started about one month earlier than last year. In addition to sending work teams to assist, various localities have trained a large number of key personnel. With the help of cadres in various places, many farmers have used the money from selling surplus grain or winter production income to purchase livestock and farm implements. Farmers in the nine counties of Urumqi Prefecture have purchased and repaired more than 10,000 pieces of farm implements. Farmers in nineteen counties in Hami, Yili, and other places have added more than 3,300 head of draft animals. To help farmers with production, the People's Bank has provided a total of more than 20 billion yuan in loans, and supply and marketing cooperatives have allocated more than 250,000 pieces of farm implements and organized the local processing of 150,000 pieces of small farm implements.

The twenty-three state-owned farms throughout Xinjiang have also played a demonstration role in spring plowing, driving mass production. In the production plans of each farm, the unit area yield of major crops has been increased compared to last year. Wheat is increased by 37 percent, and cotton is increased by 48 percent. The Turpan Horticultural Farm and the county demonstration farm have sown a total of 150 mu of high-yield cotton, striving to produce an average of 800 jin of seed cotton per mu. Under its leadership, farmers in the first, fourth, and fifth districts have established a large-area high-yield plan for 15,000 mu of fine cotton, targeting an average yield of 350 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    新疆省各族农民紧张进行春耕
    新疆各地的春季播种工作已进入紧张阶段，在塔里木、准噶尔盆地边沿的每一个绿洲上，到处都扬溢着各族男女农民的劳动歌声，拖拉机、耕牛耕马在紧张地进行耕耙。南疆大部地区已完成春麦播种，现在正耕种其他作物。和阗专区三月下旬就种完了五十五万亩春麦，现正播种棉花、玉米。北疆除阿勒泰、塔城等专区部分山区外，其他地区也普遍开犁。春播早的吐鲁番，已播完春麦开始种棉。乌鲁木齐专区北九县和伊犁、塔城、哈密等专区部分县，都正在播种春麦。早种的春麦已经出苗，全部冬麦也都返青，北疆冬麦苗一般高五、六公分，分蘖三个以上，南疆阿克苏、莎车等专区，一般麦苗高九至十五公分，有的已开始拔节。
    新疆省今年春耕工作，约比去年提早一个月开始。各地除派出工作组帮助工作外，并训练了大批骨干。在各地干部的帮助下，很多农民都把卖余粮的钱或冬季生产收入购买了牲畜农具。乌鲁木齐专区九个县的农民就买回和整修了一万多件农具。哈密、伊犁等地十九个县的农民共添购耕畜三千三百多头。为了帮助农民生产，人民银行共贷出二百多亿元贷款，供销社拨出农具二十五万多件，并就地组织加工小农具十五万件。
    全疆二十三个国营农场在春耕中也发挥了示范作用，带动群众生产。各农场生产计划中，主要作物单位面积产量都比去年提高。小麦提高百分之三十七，棉花提高百分之四十八。吐鲁番园艺场和县示范农场共播丰产棉花一百五十亩，争取平均每亩产籽棉八百斤，在它的带动下，一、四、五等区农民把一万五千亩良棉订定了平均每亩产籽棉三百五十斤的大面积丰产计划。　（符镇殿）
