In the Northeast China forest areas, the state-owned commercial system has established a large number of supply institutions. In the second quarter of this year, major forest areas will gradually extend the state-owned commercial network to the work sites, directly meeting with workers.

In early 1953, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee and relevant departments sent people to the forest areas to understand the impact of inconvenient transportation and insufficient supply of materials on the lives of employees. After this investigation, they began to establish state-owned commercial supply institutions in the forest areas. Starting from the second quarter of 1953, the commercial networks of state-owned native produce, grain, and general merchandise companies successively extended to the forest areas. State-owned native produce companies established native produce supply stations in the locations of various Forest Industry Bureaus in the Jilin forest area and established a forest area native produce supply store in Dunhua County. Grain companies established retail departments in each Forest Industry Bureau. General merchandise companies directly went to the work sites and established fixed or mobile sales teams. The state-owned commercial system in the Yichun area also replenished supply institutions. By the end of 1953, the number of state-owned stores in the Northeast China forest areas had increased to 131. In the first quarter of this year, major forest areas established joint ventures of state-owned trading enterprises. In the past, it was difficult for forest area employees to eat vegetables and meat in the summer. After the native produce company entered the mountains, eggs and vegetables were transported in, and live pigs and live sheep were also transported to the forest areas for slaughter. Now, forest area employees can eat fresh meat and vegetables at any time. In 1953, the state-owned commercial system in Northeast China supplied a total of 96,700 tons of staple and non-staple foods to the forest areas, including 1,100 tons of meat and 12,763 tons of vegetables. Large shrimp, sea fish, and large dried shrimp were also transported into the forest areas. In winter, most Forest Industry Bureaus dug cellars to store vegetables. Tofu workshops were also commonly established at various work sites. The general merchandise company system supplied forest area workers with a large number of floral striped shirts, floral washbasins, floral mattress covers, and various soaps, candies, cigarettes, and alcohol. In the past, workers had to ask for leave to go down the mountain to buy a few pounds of cotton. Now, if they want to buy general merchandise, they can go to the state-owned store at any time to choose and buy.

    东北林区设立大批国营商业供应机构
    东北区国营商业系统已在林区设立了大批供应机构，今年第二季度各大林区将把国营商业网逐步伸展到作业现场，直接和工人见面。
    一九五三年初，东北财政经济委员会和有关部门派人深入林区，了解了因交通不便、物资供应不足而影响职工生活的情况以后，就开始在林区设立国营商业供应机构。从一九五三年第二季度开始，国营土产、粮食、百货公司的商业网先后伸展到了林区。国营土产公司在吉林林区各森林工业管理局所在地成立了土产供应站，在敦化县成立了林区土产供应商店；粮食公司在各森林工业管理局成立了门市部；百货公司直接深入到作业现场，设立了固定或流动的售货组。伊春地区国营商业系统也充实了供应机构。到一九五三年末，东北林区的国营商店已增设到一百三十一处。今年第一季度，各大林区都设立了国营贸易企业联营公司。过去林区职工在夏季很难吃到蔬菜和肉类。土产公司入山以后，鸡蛋、蔬菜都运来了，活猪、活羊也运到林区屠宰。现在林区职工随时都可以吃到新鲜的肉类和蔬菜。一九五三年东北区国营商业系统供应给林区的主食品、副食品共有九万六千七百多吨，其中肉类就有一千一百吨，蔬菜有一万二千七百六十三吨。大虾、海鱼、大海米等也运进了林区。在冬季，大部分森林工业管理局都挖了菜窖，储藏了蔬菜。各个作业现场还普遍设立了豆腐房。百货公司系统供应了林区工人大量花条衬衣、花洗脸盆、花褥单和各种香皂、糖果、烟、酒等。过去工人想买几斤棉花，还得请假下山，现在要想买一般日用百货，都可以随时到国营商店去选购。
