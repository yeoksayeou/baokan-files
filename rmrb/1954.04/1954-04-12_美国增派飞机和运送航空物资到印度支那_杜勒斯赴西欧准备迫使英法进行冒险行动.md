Xinhua News Agency, April 10th—The US government is stepping up its efforts to increase the number of aircraft and transport other aviation materiel to Indochina, expanding its intervention in the Indochina War. Washington confirmed on the 8th that the US Secretary of Defense had ordered the US military's Far East Command to accelerate the transfer of all available aviation materiel from US bases in the Far East to Indochina.

    On the same day, US officials in Saigon said that "large numbers" of US B-26 bombers and C-47 Dakota transport aircraft had arrived in Indochina in the past three days. It is reported that these aircraft were flown from the Philippines by American pilots.

    The US Far East Air Force Command in Tokyo has canceled the leave of transportation personnel. According to a military spokesman, this is because they are engaged in "more urgent tasks." United Press reporter Al Kaff concluded that this "shows that the United States has stepped up its military aid to Indochina."

    News has it that the US has dispatched "technical personnel" stationed at bases in Japan to reinforce the 250 US Air Force personnel already participating in war activities in Indochina.

    At the same time, American journalists revealed that American flight personnel "may" have participated in actual combat. United Press reporter Al Kaff reported on the 10th that "Americans – the number is not yet revealed – piloting transport planes in Indochina may be performing flight missions in actual combat, because the French have used transport planes to closely support ground combat at least twice."

    On the eve of the Geneva Conference, the series of war cries issued by US government leaders and the measures taken by the US government to expand its intervention in the Indochina War are clearly aimed at undermining efforts at the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina, which cannot but arouse serious vigilance.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th—TASS, Paris, April 10th—Washington reports that US Secretary of State Dulles is scheduled to fly to Western Europe on the evening of the 10th. He will visit London and Paris. Accompanying Dulles are State Department Advisor Douglas MacArthur II, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Merchant, and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson.

    A State Department spokesman said that Dulles is prepared to hold talks in London and Paris on the issue of "joint action" in Indochina. As everyone knows, the so-called "joint action" proposal put forward by the United States, which is aimed at opposing the people of Indochina, is a replica of the Korean adventure, and the US armed intervention in Korea was carried out under the banner of the "United Nations."

    Dulles's sudden arrival in Western Europe on the eve of the Geneva Conference, according to the "Volunteer Army News," is because France, Britain, and other countries are unwilling to take actions that may threaten "the opportunity to reach an agreement" on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. "Paris-Normandy" newspaper, when talking about the US exerting pressure on its allies, said that although London and Paris's opposition to Washington's overly tough proposals showed differences among the three countries, "this is still better than being dragged into an adventure."

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th—In coordination with US Secretary of State Dulles's trip to London and Paris to coerce Britain and France to follow the United States in taking joint adventurous actions in Indochina, some of the most reactionary senators in the United States are openly making blackmailing threats against US allies: If they do not yield to the will of the United States, the US Congress will suspend appropriations for "aid" to them.

    US Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges told reporters on the 9th after meeting with US President Eisenhower that the US would "re-evaluate the entire foreign aid program" based on the "extent to which its allies are willing to cooperate."

    Senator Knowland openly declared on the 8th that if some of America's allies do not "respond" to Dulles's demands, the US Congress may delay their "aid" appropriations. He told reporters again on the 10th that any country that does not accept the US's Far East policy must bear the "risk" of reduced "aid."

### 美国增派飞机和运送航空物资到印度支那  杜勒斯赴西欧准备迫使英法进行冒险行动

    美国增派飞机和运送航空物资到印度支那
    杜勒斯赴西欧准备迫使英法进行冒险行动
    【新华社十日讯】美国政府正加紧增派飞机并运送其他航空物资前往印度支那，扩大干涉印度支那战争。华盛顿方面八日证实：美国国防部长已命令美军远东总司令部，加速把美国在远东基地的一切可以拿出的航空物资，运送到印度支那去。
    同一天，西贡的美国官方人士说：在过去三天中，已有“大批”美国B—二十六式轰炸机和C—四十七达科他式运输机抵达印度支那。据报道，这些飞机是由美国驾驶员从菲律宾驾驶去的。
    在东京的美国远东空军司令部已经取消了运输工作人员的休假，据军方发言人说：这是因为要从事“更紧急的任务”。合众社记者阿尔·凯夫断定：这“表明美国已经加紧了它对印度支那的军事援助”。
    有消息说：美国已派遣驻日本基地的“技术人员”去增援两百五十名已在印度支那参加战争活动的美国空军人员。
    同时，美国记者透露，美国飞行人员“可能”已参加实际作战。合众社记者阿尔·凯夫十日报道说：在印度支那驾驶运输机的“美国人——人数尚未透露——可能正在实际作战中担任飞行任务，因为法国人曾经至少有两次用运输机紧密支援地面战斗”。
    在日内瓦会议前夕，美国政府领袖所发出的一连串的战争叫嚣，以及美国政府所采取的这些扩大干涉印度支那战争的措施，其目的显然在于破坏日内瓦会议中谋求恢复印度支那和平的努力，这不能不引起人们的严重警惕。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：华盛顿消息，美国国务卿杜勒斯定于十日晚间乘飞机到西欧去。他将访问伦敦和巴黎。随杜勒斯同行的有国务院顾问道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟第二、负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿麦钱特和负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊。
    国务院发言人说，杜勒斯准备在伦敦和巴黎就印度支那“联合行动”问题进行会谈。大家知道，美国提出的旨在反对印度支那人民的所谓“联合行动”建议，就是朝鲜冒险的翻版，美国武装干涉朝鲜就是在“联合国”的旗帜下进行的。
    杜勒斯在日内瓦会议前夕突然到西欧来照“义勇军报”的说法，是因为法国、英国和其他国家，不愿意采取可能威胁到就恢复印度支那和平的问题“达成协议的机会”的行动。“巴黎—诺曼底报”在谈到美国对它的盟国施加压力时说，虽然伦敦和巴黎反对华盛顿过于强硬的建议表现出三国之间有着分歧，“但这总比可能被拖入冒险要好些”。
    【新华社十一日讯】配合着美国国务卿杜勒斯到伦敦和巴黎去胁迫英国和法国跟随美国一道来在印度支那采取联合冒险行动，美国国内最反动的一些参议员正公然对美国的盟国提出敲诈性的威胁：如果它们不屈从美国的意志，美国国会就要暂缓给它们以“援助”拨款。
    美国参议院拨款委员会主席布里奇斯九日在和美国总统艾森豪威尔会谈后，对记者说：美国要根据它的“盟国愿意合作的程度，重新估计整个援外计划”。
    参议员诺兰八日就露骨地宣称：如果美国的某些盟国不“响应”杜勒斯的要求，美国国会可能延缓对它们的“援助”拨款。他十日又对记者说：凡是不接受美国远东政策的国家，必须承担“援助”减少的“风险”。
