Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 10th: With the Yangtze River flood season approaching, large quantities of surplus grain from the Southwest region are being concentrated along the Yangtze River bank in preparation for continuous outward shipment.

The second quarter of this year will see the largest quantity of surplus grain transferred out of the Southwest region. The amount of grain to be transferred out in the second quarter will be double the actual amount transferred out in the first quarter, and 58 percent more than the same quarter last year.

Currently, counties in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces with outward transfer tasks are concentrating and processing grain. Large quantities of grain sacks from the Northeast, North China, and East China regions supporting the Southwest are being transported to various locations. Without affecting spring plowing production, the broad masses of farmers have vigorously supported the grain departments, concentrating the dispersed grain along transportation lines. Workers at various wharves in Chongqing receive large numbers of grain boats from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jialing River every day, and at the same time load the packaged grain onto ships for outward transfer, often working until late at night.

Starting in April, the Southwest transportation departments increased the means of transport for grain. In Sichuan's inland river lines alone, there are more than 4,800 large and small wooden boats participating in grain transport. The Chongqing Port Authority's transportation plan for the second quarter is 48 percent higher than that of the first quarter, and starting from April, a ship operation plan is being implemented on the Yangtze River to ensure correct and balanced transportation, thereby increasing transport volume. All employees have drawn up unit or individual production plans for April to ensure the completion of the grain outward transfer task.

    西南区大批余粮向长江沿岸集中准备外运
    【新华社重庆十日电】长江涨水的季节快要到来了，西南大批余粮正向长江沿岸集中，准备源源外运。
    今年第二季度是西南区调运到区外去的余粮最多的一个季度。第二季度将要外调的粮食比第一季度实际外调数增加一倍，比去年同季度增加百分之五十八。
    现在，四川、贵州两省有外调任务的县份正在把粮食集中和加工。东北、华北、华东各地支援西南的大批装粮麻袋，正陆续运到各地。广大农民群众在不影响春耕生产下，大力支援了粮食部门，把分散的粮食集中到交通沿线。重庆各个码头的职工每天要迎接来自长江上游和嘉陵江上的大批粮船，同时又将粮包装上轮船向外调运，常常忙碌到深夜。
    四月份开始，西南交通部门增加了运输粮食的交通工具。仅四川内河各线参加运粮的大小木船就有四千八百多只。重庆港务局第二季度的运输计划比第一季度增加百分之四十八，并从四月份起在长江上推行船舶运行作业计划，做到运输正确、均衡，以增加运量。全体职工为保证完成粮食外运任务，已订出单位或个人四月份的生产计划。
