New Measures to Improve Working Conditions for Underground Workers
Hanqiao Coal Mine in Jiawang, Jiangsu Province Opens Sunlamp Bathhouse

The newly built sunlamp bathhouse at the Hanqiao Coal Mine in Jiawang, Jiangsu Province, has been in use since April 1.

The sunlamp bathhouse is divided into several sections: a changing room, a bathroom, a drying room, and a sunlamp room. After the workers come up from the mine, they first go to the bathroom to shower. After showering, they push open a small door and enter the drying room. Here, everyone uses a disinfected towel to dry their bodies, puts on specially made shorts with white numbers printed on them, and then goes to the drying room. On one side of the drying room, two heaters are placed side by side to blow warm air to dry the moisture on the body, and then they enter the sunlamp room.

The sunlamp room is designed and built largely according to the sunlamp room of the Donbass Coal Mine in the Soviet Union. The room is 23 meters long, with 27 sunlamps, each with 700 candlepower, arranged on the east and west sides. From the entrance to the exit of the sunlamp room, a straight wooden plank road is laid, which is an electric automatic timing conveyor belt. Each worker puts on a pair of brown goggles at the entrance, and after stepping on the conveyor belt, there is no need to walk. The conveyor belt will steadily transport the person from the entrance to the exit, taking exactly one minute, so that everyone can enjoy sufficient sunlamp exposure. Music records are also played in the sunlamp room, making people feel more relaxed and happy.

Before liberation, underground workers did not see the sun all year round and often suffered from rheumatism, anemia, arthritis, athlete's foot, and other diseases. After liberation, the mine gradually carried out a series of improvement measures to improve working conditions. This time, the construction of the sunlamp bathhouse means that one minute of exposure under the sunlamp is equivalent to six hours of sunbathing. From now on, it can prevent and treat various diseases caused by lack of sunlight.

On the first day the sunlamp bathhouse was opened, the workers of the Patriotic No. 1 Coal Mining Team were the first to receive sunlamp exposure. When they walked out of the sunlamp room, they said happily: With it, we will be more energetic in production.

    改善井下工人劳动条件的新措施
    江苏省贾汪韩桥煤矿开放太阳灯浴室
    江苏省贾汪韩桥煤矿新设的太阳灯浴室，已经在四月一日开始使用了。
    太阳灯浴室共分更衣室、浴室、揩身室、干燥室、太阳灯室等几个部分。浴室内有一个大浴池和二十个淋浴器，工人走上矿井，先到浴室内洗澡，沐过淋浴，便推开一扇小门，走进揩身室，在这里，每个人用消过毒的毛巾揩去身上的水，穿起特制的印着白色号码的短裤，再走到干燥室，干燥室的一边，并排放着两部暖风机，让暖风机吹干身上的水分后，就走进太阳灯室。
    太阳灯室大致是按照苏联顿巴斯煤矿的太阳灯室设计建造的，室长二十三公尺，东西两面排列着二十七盏有七百支光的太阳灯。从太阳灯室的入口到出口，底下铺着一段笔直的木板道，这是一个电动的自动定时传送带。每个工人在入口处带上一付棕色护目镜，一脚踏上传送带后，用不着行走，传送带就可安安稳稳地把人从入口送到出口，历时刚好一分钟，使每个人都享受到足够的太阳灯浴。太阳灯室里并播送着音乐唱片，使人的身心更加感到轻松愉快。
    解放前，井下的工人们整年不见太阳，常患风湿、贫血、关节炎、脚气等疾病。解放后该矿逐步进行了一系列的改进措施，改善了劳动条件。这次建设了太阳灯浴室，工人在太阳灯下照射一分钟等于在太阳光下晒六小时，从此就可预防并医治因不见太阳而起的各种疾病了。
    在太阳灯浴室开放的头一天，爱国一队采煤队的工人首先受到了太阳灯的照射，当他们走出太阳灯室时，高兴地说：有了它，我们搞生产就更有劲了。
