    Measures to Prevent Wheat Midges
    Cao Hualin

    The wheat midge is one of the most damaging pests of wheat crops. In 1950, the Nanyang region of Henan and the Fuyang region of Anhui experienced wheat midge infestations, resulting in the loss of over 400 million catties of wheat. In 1951, Jianyang and other counties in Sichuan suffered wheat midge infestations, leading to yield reductions of over 50% per mu. In 1952, the Fuyang region of Anhui Province lost 220 million catties of wheat due to wheat midge damage. This highlights the crucial importance of preventing this pest to ensure increased wheat production.

    The wheat midge is also known as the wheat blossom midge, small red midge, jaundice midge, wheat maggot, etc. Its life cycle consists of four stages: adult, egg, larva, and pupa. The adult resembles a small orange-red mosquito. Preventing wheat midge infestations involves eliminating these adults. Adults typically begin to appear in mid to late April, and their lifespan is generally only three to five days. After pupae transform into adults, they quickly mate and lay eggs, preferring to deposit them on wheat ears that have not yet flowered. The eggs hatch into larvae after five to seven days. The larvae penetrate the wheat grains through the seams of the outer and inner glumes, feeding on the grain's sap. Affected grains become shrunken, hollow, or even empty shells.

    Over the past four years, investigations and studies on wheat midges, along with prevention efforts, have led to a preliminary understanding of their occurrence patterns and some effective prevention methods. Several of these effective prevention methods are described below:

      (1) Inspecting for Larvae in the Soil: The wheat midge adult stage is short, and delays in intervention can affect prevention effectiveness. Therefore, precise field inspections are critical for wheat midge control. Inspections should be conducted in wheat fields that were affected in the current or previous year. The inspection method involves digging up one cubic foot of soil, dividing it into layers of one to two inches, three to four inches, etc., up to four layers, and placing each layer in a separate bag. During inspection, pour one bag into a container (bucket, basin, etc.) filled with clean water and stir thoroughly. Then, pour the mud slurry into a copper sieve (60 meshes per square inch) for filtration. Rinse away the mud and sand with clean water and record the number of larvae or pupae remaining on the sieve. Repeat this process for the remaining three bags. This allows you to infer the larval activity based on the number of insects in each layer. This inspection should be conducted twice a year, before wheat tillering and after harvest.

    (2) Prevention Methods

    1. Selecting Pest-Resistant Varieties: This is the long-term direction for preventing wheat midges. Currently, many wheat varieties resistant to wheat midges, such as "6028," "2419," and "Northwest Station No. 2," have been selected in various regions. For example, in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, in 1953, the average wheat infestation rate was 10% to 40%, but the "6028" wheat variety had an infestation rate of less than 1%. Generally, wheat grains with tightly closed glumes can hinder adult oviposition and possess pest resistance. Various regions should select high-quality, pest-resistant varieties suitable for their local climate, geographical environment, and farmers' farming habits.

    2. Spraying 0.5% active ingredient 666 powder: According to experiments in Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Ningxia, and other provinces, 666 powder is very effective in controlling wheat midge adults. Generally, the first spraying should be carried out when the wheat begins to head and adults are detected in the field. Due to the short lifespan of the adults, delaying spraying until adults are heavily present will not achieve the desired effect. A second spraying should be done five days later, and a third spraying can be done if adults are still abundant. During the first spraying, when adult oviposition is at its peak, the application rate should be 3 catties per mu. This can be reduced to 2 catties per mu for the subsequent two sprays. Spraying should be done in the evening or early morning. In areas where hand-operated powder sprayers are lacking, airplane-style cloth bag powder applicators can be widely promoted.

    3. Netting: This is a relatively common prevention method currently adopted by farmers. Its disadvantage is that it can easily damage the wheat during control, but it can still be used in areas where pest infestations are severe and 666 powder spraying and switching to pest-resistant varieties cannot be widely promoted in the short term. There are many types of insect nets used in various regions, but the following types have the best effect:

    Flat Net: Use sparse cloth (such as mosquito net cloth, gauze, etc.) to make a rectangular net 15 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. Sew a hemp rope along the upper and lower edges, and tie wooden sticks or bamboo poles equal in width to the net on the left and right ends. When using, wet the net with water, and two people each hold one end and move forward quickly in step along the wheat rows.

    Cattle Trough Net or Folding Net: Use bamboo poles or other materials to make a cattle trough-shaped frame and sew on sparse cloth. When using, two people each hold one end and pull forward to catch insects. The folding net replaces the bamboo poles on the upper and lower edges of the cattle trough net with thick ropes. This way, when pulled to the end of the field, the insects can be killed by folding it left and right.

    Square-Mouth Net: Use bamboo to make a two-foot square frame and sew a sparse cloth net behind it. The bottom of the net is large and the mouth is small. Tie a rope to each side of the net opening. When in use, one person holds the rope and moves forward. Because the bottom is large and the mouth is small, insects cannot easily escape.

    Things to note when netting: (1) Generally, netting should begin when the wheat starts to head and insects are present in the field. It is best to net every day until there are very few adults. Especially one or two days after heavy rain, there will be a large number of adults emerging from the soil, so netting should be intensified. (2) Netting should begin when the sun goes down and the adults are active, and continue until dark. In addition, it can also be done in the early morning or on cloudy days, but the effect is smaller. If there is strong wind or low temperatures, the adults will mostly hide between the wheat plants and will not move, so it is not necessary to net. (3) Flat nets and cattle trough nets must be soaked in water before use. When the weather is dry, they must be soaked in water after each pull to prevent adults from escaping. Folding nets and square-mouth nets do not need to be soaked in water. (4) When netting, two-thirds or one-half of the net should be exposed above the wheat ears and tilted slightly forward for the best effect. Before netting, black smut (wheat smut) should be removed to avoid spreading the infection. (5) Netting only catches a portion of the adults at a time, so each time it is necessary to pull back and forth. Or, several nets can be arranged in front and behind to be carried out at the same time. It has been proven that the rear net often catches more insects than the front net, because the front net disturbs the wheat plants, the adults fly up, and they are caught by the rear net.

    防治小麦吸浆虫的办法
    曹华林
    小麦吸浆虫是为害麦类作物最大的一种害虫。一九五○年河南南阳、安徽阜阳两个专区发生小麦吸浆虫，损失小麦四亿多斤。一九五一年四川简阳等县发生小麦吸浆虫，每亩小麦减产达百分之五十以上，一九五二年安徽省阜阳专区因小麦吸浆虫为害损失小麦二亿二千万斤。由此可见，防治这种虫害，是保证小麦增产的重要环节。
    小麦吸浆虫又叫喝浆虫、小红虫、黄疸虫、麦蛆等。它的一生有成虫、卵、幼虫和蛹四个时期。成虫很像一个橙红色的小蚊子。防治小麦吸浆虫就是要消灭这种成虫，成虫一般在四月中下旬开始发生，成虫的寿命一般只有三、五天。蛹羽化为成虫后很快就交配产卵并且最喜把卵产在没有扬花的麦穗上。卵经过五天到七天就孵化为幼虫。幼虫经麦粒的外颖和内颖合缝处侵入麦粒内部，吸食麦粒浆液。麦粒被害后，瘦缩凹瘪，甚至变成空壳。
    四年来，各地经过对小麦吸浆虫的调查研究和防治，已初步掌握了它的发生规律，同时也取得了一些防治经验。现在把几种有效的防治办法介绍在下面：
      （一）检查土内幼虫，小麦吸浆虫成虫发生期短，动手稍迟，就要影响防治效果，因此精密的田间检查，对防治小麦吸浆虫非常重要。检查应在当年或上年受害的麦田中进行。检查办法是掘土一立方尺，按一至二寸、三至四寸……四层，分别装袋，检查时，先将一袋倒入盛有清水的家具内（桶、盆皆可）进行搅拌，然后把泥浆倾入铜筛中（铜筛每方寸六十眼）过滤，再用清水洗去泥沙，将留在筛上的幼虫或蛹等分别记载。其余三袋同法进行。这样可以根据各层虫数，推知幼虫活动情况。这种检查每年应在麦苗拔节前和收获后进行两次。
    （二）防治办法
    一、选种抗虫品种。这是长期防治小麦吸浆虫的方向。目前各地已选出“六○二八”“二四一九”、“西北站二号”等不少抗吸浆虫品种。如一九五三年陕西省兴平县一般小麦被害率为百分之十到四十，但“六○二八”小麦被害不到百分之一。大凡麦粒颖壳紧密，都能影响成虫产卵，具有抗虫能力。各地应根据当地气候条件、地理环境以及农民耕作习惯，选用当地质量均优的抗虫品种。
    二、喷撒千分之五有效成分的六六六粉。根据陕西、河南、安徽、宁夏等省试验，六六六粉防治吸浆虫成虫有特效。一般应在麦子开始吐穗，田间发现成虫时进行第一次喷药。因成虫寿命很短，俟成虫大量发生时再喷药，就不能收到应有效果。五天后喷第二次，以后如成虫仍多可喷第三次。第一次喷药时，因成虫产卵最盛，每亩喷药以三斤为宜，后两次可减到每亩二斤。喷药时间以傍晚和早晨为宜。在手摇喷粉器缺乏地区可广泛推用飞机式等布袋撒粉器。
    三、拉网防治。这是目前农民比较普遍采用的防治办法。它的缺点是在防治时容易损坏麦子，但在虫害严重，六六六喷粉和换种抗虫品种一时不能大量推广的地区，仍可继续采用。各地使用的捕虫网种类很多，但以下列几种效果最好：
    平网：用稀布（如蚊帐布、纱布等）做成长一丈五尺，宽二尺半的长方形网，上下两边各缝一条麻绳，左右两端拴上和网宽相等的木棍或竹竿。使用时把网用水浸湿，二人各持一端，顺麦垄齐步快进。
    牛槽网或折网：用竹竿等物做成牛槽形的架子，缝上稀布即成。使用时二人各持一端向前拉捕。折网是将牛槽网上下两边的竹竿，改用粗绳代替。这样拉到地头时，左右一折，就可以把虫子拍死。
    方口网：用竹子做成一个二尺见方的框子，后面缝上一个稀布网，网底大口小，网口两边各拴一绳，用时一人持绳前进。由于底大口小，虫子不易逃出。
    拉网注意的几件事情：（1）一般应在麦子开始吐穗，田间有虫时就要拉捕，以后最好每天拉，直到成虫很少时为止。特别在大雨后一二天必有大量成虫出土，更要加紧进行。（2）拉的时间应在太阳落山，成虫活动时开始，到天黑时止。此外清晨或阴天也可以拉，但效果比较小。如遇大风或低温天气，成虫多隐伏麦株间不动，不必进行。（3）平网和牛槽网，用前必须浸水，天干时，每拉一次就要浸水一次，以免成虫飞逃。折网和方口网无须浸水。（4）拉网时，应将网的三分之二或二分之一露在麦穗以上，并稍向前倾，效果才大。拉前应先拔除黑穗（乌麦），以免扩大传染。（5）拉网一次，只能捕捉一部分成虫，故每次要来回拉。或以数网前后排列，同时进行。事实证明，后网常较前网拉的虫多，因前网扰动麦株，成虫飞起，刚好被后网拉到。
