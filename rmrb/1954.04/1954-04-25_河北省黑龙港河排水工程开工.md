The Heilonggang River drainage project in Hebei Province commenced in early April. The Heilonggang River encompasses a vast area east of the Grand Canal and west of the Ziya River. This area is low-lying and prone to flooding during the rainy season. To reduce the risk of waterlogging and safeguard agricultural production, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Department decided to construct the Heilonggang River drainage project. The entire project includes dredging six main canals, excavating diversion canals, and constructing numerous gates, culverts, and bridges, involving over 70 million cubic meters of earthwork. It is the largest drainage project in the North China region. Upon completion, the project will protect 950,000 mu of fertile land in more than ten counties across the Cangxian, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang prefectures from waterlogging. In the Jiaokouwa waterlogged area of Jinghai County downstream, approximately 130,000 mu of land will be available for planting autumn wheat, and another 90,000 mu will be available for harvesting reeds.

Prior to construction, various localities widely conducted water removal work in the work areas. Dozens of pumps removed nearly 10 million cubic meters of accumulated water, which not only reduced the need for a large amount of cement but also saved the state 850 million yuan and 100,000 man-days of labor. In terms of supplies, a section of the Cangxian Prefecture established over fifty supply stations, transporting more than 2 million jin of grain and over 100,000 jin of non-staple foods, ensuring timely supply. At the same time, more than 300 construction sheds, medical sheds, and kitchen sheds were built. The more than 80,000 civilian laborers participating in the project have now begun construction. It is expected that all earthwork will be completed by the end of May, and the drainage effectiveness can be realized during this year's flood season.

    河北省黑龙港河排水工程开工
    河北省黑龙港河排水工程已于四月上旬开工。黑龙港河包括南运河以东子牙河以西的广大地区，这一带地势低洼，雨季积水成灾。为了减免内涝灾害，保障农业生产，河北省人民政府水利厅决定兴修黑龙港河排水工程。全部工程包括疏浚干渠六道、开挖引水渠和修建闸、涵、桥梁多处，共七千多万公方土方，是华北区最大的一项排水工程。全部工程完成后，可使沧县、天津、石家庄三个专区十余县九十五万亩良田免受涝灾；下游静海县贾口洼积水区约有十三万亩土地可播种秋麦，还有九万亩可收割芦苇。
    施工前，各地普遍进行了工区积水排除工作。几十部抽水机排除了近千万立方公尺的积水，这不仅减少了大量水泥难工，而且替国家节省了八亿五千万元的开支和十万个人工。在供应方面，沧县专区一个工段就建立了五十多个供应站，运到粮食二百多万斤，副食品十多万斤，保证了供应及时。同时还搭盖工棚、治疗棚灶棚等三百多处。参加这一工程的八万多民工现已开始施工。预计全部土方工程将在五月底竣工，在今年汛期中即可发挥排水效能。
