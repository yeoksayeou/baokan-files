Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: Eden Yields to U.S. Plot to Obstruct Peaceful Resolution of Indochina Issue; British MPs Raise Sharp Questions and Criticisms

Xinhua News Agency, April 15th Dispatch: Following a meeting in London between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Eden, a mutually agreed statement was issued on the 13th.

The statement said: Dulles and Eden fully exchanged views on the Indochina issue and the Southeast Asia issue. In this statement, Dulles and Eden dared not mention the fact that the United States is massively interfering in the Indochina war and is plotting to expand this war of aggression. They deliberately did not mention that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the legitimate government of Vietnam, established through formal universal suffrage of the Vietnamese people in 1946. Instead, they distorted the struggle led by this legitimate government of the Vietnamese people to resist foreign aggression and strive for democracy, peace, freedom, and independence as an "attempt to overthrow the legitimate, friendly government of Vietnam recognized by us (the United States and Britain)." Moreover, they described the liberation wars waged by the peoples of Laos and Cambodia as "incursions" from outside. The statement also groundlessly stated that the Indochinese people's struggle for national independence "not only threatens those countries that are directly involved but also endangers the peace and security of the entire Southeast Asia and West Pacific region, which is of vital interest to our two countries and other friendly countries and allies." However, it is well known that what truly threatens the peace and security of Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia and West Pacific region is precisely the United States' aggressive policy of expanding its network of military bases in Asia, organizing aggressive military blocs, participating in and attempting to expand the Indochina war, and aggressing against the People's Republic of China.

Under the above-mentioned distorted pretext, the statement indicated that the U.S. and British governments "are prepared to study with other major countries concerned the possibility of forming a collective defense within the framework of the United Nations Charter to ensure peace, security, and freedom in Southeast Asia and the West Pacific." This means that the U.S. and British governments are attempting to begin organizing an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia and the West Pacific to expand interference in the Indochina war.

Dulles and Eden, apparently to cope with world public opinion and the public opinion of the United States, Britain, and France, stated in this statement: "We hope that the Geneva Conference will lead to the restoration of peace in Indochina." However, the statement then went on to say: "We believe that the prospect of establishing a defensively oriented unity throughout Southeast Asia and the West Pacific will help achieve a glorious peace in Indochina." Thus, the statement itself clearly demonstrates that the purpose of Dulles's pressure on Eden to issue this "joint statement" was to attempt to tie Britain and France tightly together under the guise of so-called "defense" and "unity," forcing them to join the United States in obstructing the Geneva Conference from peacefully resolving the Indochina issue, so as to continue and expand the war of aggression against the Indochinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, April 15th Dispatch: London - The statement issued after the meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and the British Foreign Secretary in London has caused a wave of opposition in the British Parliament's House of Commons. When Eden reported the results of the meeting to the House of Commons on the 13th at the request of the members, he was met with sharp questions and criticisms from many Labour MPs.

Eden read out a statement in the House of Commons that was identical in content to the joint communiqué he issued with Dulles. His statement was interrupted by some Labour MPs. Labour MPs shouted "Shameful". MP Donnelly believed that the statement "deliberately undermined the Geneva Conference." MP Henderson questioned Eden as to whether the British government's goal was still to seek peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference. Eden said: "Our hope is that the Geneva Conference will lead to the restoration of peace in Indochina." He said: "I hope to see the Geneva Conference succeed as much as anyone." However, Labour MPs shouted: "You have damaged it now."

Influential Labour MP Bevan loudly said: "Does Mr. Eden know that the statement he has issued will be hated by the majority of the British people?" Bevan criticized the part of Eden and Dulles' statement regarding Britain and the U.S. "being prepared to study with other major countries concerned" "the possibility of forming a collective defense to ensure peace, security, and freedom in Southeast Asia and the West Pacific." Bevan said that Asia would view this as establishing an organization similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Southeast Asia, in order to forcibly impose colonial rule on Southeast Asia. This plan will alienate Britain from the Commonwealth countries in Southeast Asia. Bevan accused that: This will "be regarded by the world as (Britain's) yielding to American pressure."

In response to the MPs' inquiries, Eden replied that Britain had so far made no promises other than agreeing to study the plan. He said that he and Dulles "did not reach any agreement. The agreement we reached was an agreement on studying certain possibilities."

Eden's response failed to satisfy the Labour MPs. A group of Labour MPs has already raised a motion at the secret meeting of Labour MPs' leaders, accusing Eden's statement. This motion "expresses regret" over Eden's statement.

### 艾登屈从美国图谋阻挠和平解决印度支那问题  英国下院议员纷纷提出尖锐质问和抨击

    艾登屈从美国图谋阻挠和平解决印度支那问题
    英国下院议员纷纷提出尖锐质问和抨击
    【新华社十五日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣艾登在伦敦会谈结束后，于十三日发表了一项双方同意的声明。
    这个声明说：杜勒斯和艾登对印度支那问题和东南亚问题充分交换了意见。杜勒斯和艾登在这个声明中不敢提到美国大规模干涉印度支那战争，并正在图谋扩大这个侵略战争的事实。他们故意不提越南民主共和国政府是一九四六年越南人民正式普选成立的越南合法政府，却歪曲这个合法政府所领导的越南人民抵抗外国侵略、争取民主和平、自由与独立的斗争是“企图推翻我们（美国和英国）承认的合法的、友好的越南政府”。他们而且把寮国和高棉两国人民进行的解放战争说成是外来的“侵入”。这个声明并毫无根据地说，印度支那人民争取民族独立的斗争“不但威胁到那些现在直接有关的国家，而且危及对我们两国与其他友国和盟国有切身利害关系的整个东南亚与西太平洋地区的和平与安全”。但是，众所周知，真正威胁着印度支那和整个东南亚与西太平洋地区的和平与安全的，恰恰是美国在亚洲扩张军事基地网、组织侵略军事集团、参加并企图扩大印度支那战争、侵略中华人民共和国的侵略政策。
    在上述歪曲借口之下，这个声明表示，美、英两国政府“准备与其他主要有关国家一起研究在联合国宪章范围内建立集体防务以确保东南亚与西太平洋的和平、安全与自由的可能性”。这就是说，美、英两国政府企图着手组织东南亚与西太平洋的侵略集团，来扩大干涉印度支那战争。
    杜勒斯和艾登显然是为了应付世界舆论和美、英、法三国的舆论，在这个声明中表示：“我们希望，日内瓦会议将导致恢复印度支那的和平。”但是，声明接着却又说：“我们相信，在整个东南亚与西太平洋建立以防御为目的的团结的前景，将有助于在印度支那实现光荣的和平。”这样，这个声明本身就清楚地表明了：杜勒斯压迫艾登发表这个“共同声明”的目的，是企图在所谓“防御”和“团结”的幌子下把英国以及法国紧紧地束缚起来，迫使它们和美国一起来阻挠日内瓦会议和平解决印度支那问题，以便继续并扩大对印度支那人民的侵略战争。
    【新华社十五日讯】伦敦消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣在伦敦举行会谈后发表的声明，在英国议会下院引起了一阵反对的浪潮。艾登在十三日应议员们的要求到下院报告会谈的结果时，受到许多工党议员尖锐的质问和抨击。
    艾登在下院宣读了一项和他与杜勒斯发表的联合公报内容相同的声明。他的声明被一些工党议员所打断。工党议员们大声叫喊“可耻”。议员唐纳利认为，这个声明“蓄意破坏日内瓦会议”。议员汉德逊质问艾登，英国政府的目标是否仍然是在日内瓦会议上谋求印度支那的和平。艾登说：“我们的希望是：日内瓦会议会导致恢复印度支那的和平。”他说：“我和任何人一样盼望看到日内瓦会议成功。”但是，工党议员们高声说：“你现在已经使它受到损害了。”
    有势力的工党议员比万大声说：“艾登先生是否知道，他发表的声明将受到大多数英国人民的痛恨？”比万抨击艾登和杜勒斯的声明中关于英美“准备和其他主要有关国家一起研究”“建立集体防务以确保东南亚与西太平洋的和平、安全与自由的可能性”的部分。比万说，亚洲将认为这是要在东南亚建立一个类似北大西洋公约的组织，以便对东南亚强行施以殖民统治。这个计划将疏远英国和东南亚的英联邦国家的关系。比万指责说：这将“被全世界认为是（英国）对美国压力的屈服”。
    艾登在议员们的纷纷质询下答辩说，英国迄今除了答应研究这个计划以外，并未作任何允诺。他说，他和杜勒斯“并没有达成任何协议。我们所达成的协议是一项关于研究某些可能性的协议。”
    艾登的答复未能使工党议员们满意，有一批工党议员已在工党议员首脑人物的秘密会议中提出了一项指责艾登声明的动议，这项动议对艾登的声明“表示遗憾”。
