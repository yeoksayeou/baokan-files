    The Director Cadre Training Class, organized by the Central Academy of Drama, officially began on March 20th.
    The study period for the Director Cadre Training Class is one and a half years. Students will study political theory, directing, acting techniques, dialogue, dance (Soviet and other foreign dances), Chinese dance and other professional courses, as well as basic art courses such as drama history, art history, selected readings of world-renowned plays, painting, and model making.

    Sun Weishi, Vice President of the China Youth Art Theater, serves as the director of the Director Cadre Training Class. Renowned Chinese dramatists and writers Ouyang Yuqian, Sha Kefu, Cao Yu, Zhang Geng, and Sun Jiaxiu will lecture the class. Soviet drama expert Liesley, who has taught at the Moscow State Theater Institute for a long time and has been engaged in artistic life for more than 30 years, will also impart his years of accumulated knowledge and experience to these students.
    The drama workers who applied for the Director Cadre Training Class included 63 outstanding directors and actors with directing talent selected from major administrative regions, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and theaters and academies directly under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture. The examination committee, composed of Soviet drama expert Liesley and renowned Chinese dramatists and writers, conducted tests on applicants in political, acting, directing, and literary cultivation. After strict examinations, 23 regular students and 2 probationary students were admitted. Among the admitted students are Ouyang Shanzun, director of the currently staged drama "One Must Live That Way" in Beijing; Shi Xing, Deputy Head of the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission; A Jia, Director of the Arts Department of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera; Peking Opera director Li Zigui; Geng Zhen, actor from the Beijing People's Art Theater; and Zhulan Qiqike, the Mongolian actress who played the lead in the film "Golden Sands Beach". In addition, 15 drama workers recommended by drama groups from various regions are attending the class as auditors.
    Institute for the Study of National Music Established
    The Institute for the Study of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music was officially established on March 27th. After its establishment, the institute will unite folk artists and ancient music experts from all ethnic groups across the country, cultivate young research talents, engage in the excavation, collation, and introduction of China's national music heritage, and conduct reform experiments in a step-by-step and focused manner. It will also compile an outline of Chinese music history, translate ancient musical scores, improve national musical instruments, and integrate with current singing, creation, and teaching practices.
    The Institute for the Study of National Music currently has more than 30 researchers and graduate students, including music historians Sheng Jialun and ancient music experts Guan Pinghu and Cao Anhe. In addition, the institute has invited more than 20 ancient music experts and famous artists to serve as corresponding researchers and special performers of the institute. Kunqu Opera expert Yu Pingbo, Guqin experts Zha Fuxi, Wang Mengshu, and Wu Jinglue, historians Pan Huaisu and Yin Falu, archaeologists Chen Mengjia and Shen Congwen have all been hired as corresponding researchers of the institute.
    At the founding ceremony of the institute, Guan Pinghu played a portion of the long-lost "Guangling San." The Central Experimental Opera House performed songs and lyrics by Song Dynasty musician Jiang Kui and ancient folk songs "Jin Zi Jing" and "Dou Ye Huang" recorded by Zhu Zaiyu of the Ming Dynasty, as well as songs adapted from folk songs collected by researchers of the institute in Shanxi and other places, and other ancient music and folk music.
    The Chinese Music History Materials Exhibition Room attached to the institute was also officially opened, displaying various materials about ancient music, modern music, folk music, as well as ancient and ethnic minority musical instruments collected by the institute from various places.

    Cultivating Active Members of Mass Cultural Activities
    The first class of 58 students from the Hunan Mass Art School has officially graduated. These students were transferred from 47 rural theater troupes in four counties: Xiangtan, Xiangyin, Liuyang, and Pingjiang. They are all active members of amateur cultural activities in rural areas who do not leave production, including actors, staff, and folk artists from rural theater troupes.
    The Hunan Mass Art School adopts a teaching method that combines theory with practice and emphasizes classroom teaching and rehearsal practice. During the study period, in addition to systematically studying political common sense, the general line, literary and artistic policies, and professional theoretical courses, the students also rehearsed small programs such as flower drum opera and folk dances.
    Through study, the ideological and professional levels of the students have generally been improved. After learning the general line, many people said that they would definitely participate in mutual aid groups after returning home, and many people spontaneously wrote letters to their families, mobilizing their families to sell surplus grain to the state. When the students first arrived at the school, they generally did not know how to act in plays, and they did not sing in time with the rhythm. After learning and practicing, most of the students knew that they must understand the theme of the script and grasp the ideological and emotional feelings of the characters in order to perform the play well. Most of the students have learned to read music scores and can sing simple songs with music scores.

    培养群众文艺活动的积极分子
    湖南群众艺术学校第一期学员五十八名，已经正式结业。这期学员是由湘潭、湘阴、浏阳、平江四县四十七个农村剧团调来的，他们都是农村中不脱离生产的群众业余文艺活动积极分子，其中有农村剧团的演员、工作人员及民间艺人等。
    湖南群众艺术学校是以理论结合实际，课堂讲授与排演实习并重为教学方法的。学习期中，学员除较系统地学了政治常识、总路线、文艺政策及业务理论课外，还排练了花鼓戏、民间舞蹈等小型节目。
    通过学习，学员的思想水平和业务水平普遍得到提高。学过总路线后，许多人表示回家后一定参加互助组，许多人自动给家里写信，动员家里人把余粮卖给国家。学员们刚到校时，一般都不知道应该怎样来演戏，唱起歌来也不合节拍，经过学习和实习后，大部学员都知道必须了解剧本的主题思想、掌握了角色的思想情感才能演好戏。大部学员都学会了读歌谱，拿着歌谱子会唱简易的歌了。
