    Joliot-Curie Publishes Article
    Demanding that all Countries Guarantee Not to Use Atomic Weapons
    The "Humanité Hebdo" published an article by Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council. The article stated: The current situation requires people to take resolute action so that all countries immediately and solemnly guarantee not to use atomic weapons. The article continued: It is possible that countries immediately sign a convention or protocol banning atomic weapons, an action similar to the signing of the Geneva Protocol prohibiting asphyxiating gases, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons. A resolute movement launched by the world to achieve this initial goal may create a situation that no one can refuse. After making the guarantee not to use atomic weapons, a strict supervision system must be established immediately.
  Indonesian Prime Minister Issues Statement
    Calling for an End to Atomic Bomb Explosions
    On the 3rd, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo issued a statement regarding the recent U.S. hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific, calling for an end to atomic bomb explosions.
    Indonesian Deputy Speaker of Parliament Tambunan and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Rendunou both expressed their opposition to the recent U.S. hydrogen bomb test. Rendunou said that the recent hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific should not be regarded as a technical matter, but as part of the "Cold War."
  British House of Commons Holds Debate on U.S. Hydrogen Bomb Test
    Broad Public Opposes the Use of Atomic Weapons
      "Pravda" correspondent in London, F. Olyekhov, commented on the debate held in the British House of Commons on April 5 regarding the necessity of disarmament and the establishment of a supervision system, which was triggered by the recent U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island.
      Olyekhov wrote: The debate in the House of Commons is the result of the public's growing unease with the British government's attitude. The British government does not believe that it is possible to take a decisive stance on the adventurous policies of the United States, which endanger Britain's vital interests. To know what the British people want, one only needs to look at the large group of ordinary British people standing in front of Parliament before the debate began, and listen to their conversations. The wishes they expressed are the same as those expressed in the thousands of resolutions passed across the country and the thousands of letters and telegrams sent by voters to the government and government officials. They expressed the hope for disarmament and the reduction of armed forces, and the hope for international agreements to prohibit the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes and the mass slaughter of mankind.
    Olyekhov pointed out: Therefore, the parliamentary debate to a certain extent reflects the increasingly profound desire of the British people to immediately resolve the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes and the mass slaughter of mankind.
  British Scientist P.M.S. Blackett Advocates
    Banning Atomic Weapon Tests Through Negotiations
      Dr. P.M.S. Blackett, author of "The Problems Arising From Atomic Energy," published an article in the London "Daily Worker" on April 1.
    Blackett said: When discussing atomic energy issues at mass rallies, a question I often hear is: "Why are scientists willing to manufacture weapons of mass destruction?" I can appreciate the questioner's point of view. The situation over the past nine years should have caused even the most politically indifferent scientific workers to stop and think about the implications of their work. As for myself, I would like to see scientists from all countries stop manufacturing such (mass destruction) weapons.
    Blackett said that the vast majority of people, from all parties and factions, and those with no party affiliation, are very disturbed by this (U.S. test in the Marshall Islands) test (of the hydrogen bomb). They want to stop these tests. They want to see hydrogen bombs and all kinds of weapons of mass destruction banned.
    Even from a military point of view, there doesn't seem to be any benefit in exploding larger hydrogen bombs.
    Blackett said that now is indeed the time to begin high-level negotiations to avoid conducting such tests again. Blackett also quoted the original text of the Soviet government's announcement on hydrogen bomb tests on August 20, 1953, to illustrate that the Soviet government is willing to ban all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.
  Egyptian Foreign Minister Issues Statement

The statement also said that Egypt will continue to work in the United Nations to seek the prohibition of atomic weapons.  (Xinhua News Agency)

专栏：

    各国广大公众一致要求禁止使用原子武器
    约里奥—居里发表文章
    要求各国保证不使用原子武器
    “人道报星期刊”发表了世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里教授的一篇文章。文章说：目前的局势要求人们采取坚决行动，以便使各国立即庄严保证不使用原子武器。文章继续说：如果各国立即签订一个禁用原子武器的公约或议定书，可能是一个类似签订禁止窒息瓦斯、化学武器和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的行动。世界为达到这个初步目的而掀起一个坚决的运动可能造成一种使得任何人都无法拒绝的局势。在作了不使用原子武器的保证后，紧接着必须建立严格的监督制度。
  印尼总理发表声明
    呼吁终止举行原子弹爆炸
    印尼总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约三日就美国最近在太平洋举行氢弹试验一事发表声明，呼吁终止举行原子弹爆炸。
    印尼国会副议长谭布兰和外交小组委员会主席伦度诺乌都对美国最近举行的氢弹试验表示反对。伦度诺乌说，最近在太平洋举行的氢弹试验，不应该把它当作技术事情，而应该把它当作“冷战”的一部分。
  英下院就美国试验氢弹举行辩论
    广大公众反对使用原子武器
      “真理报”驻伦敦记者弗·奥列霍夫评论因美国最近在比基尼岛试验氢弹引起英国下院在四月五日举行关于裁减军备并建立监督制度的必要性的辩论。
      奥列霍夫写道：下院的辩论是公众对于英国政府的态度日益感到不安的结果。英国政府不认为它有可能对于危害英国切身利益的美国冒险政策采取断然的态度。要想知道英国人民所要的是什么，只要看看辩论开始前议会前面伫立的一大群普通英国人民，听听他们的谈话就够了。他们表示的愿望，与全国各地的所通过的几千个决议以及选民寄给政府与政府人员的几千封信与电报中所表示的愿望是一样的。他们表示希望裁减军备与武装部队，希望达成国际协议，禁止使用原子能来从事破坏目的并大规模屠杀人类。
    奥列霍夫指出：因此，议会的辩论在一定程度上反映了英国人民有日益深切的愿望，他们希望立即解决裁减军备并禁止使用原子能来从事破坏目的与大规模屠杀人类的问题。
  英国科学家柏贺浦主张
    通过谈判禁止试验原子武器
      “原子能带来的问题”一书的作者、英国科学家柏贺浦博士在四月一日的伦敦“工人日报”上发表文章。
    柏贺浦说：在群众集会上谈到原子能问题时，我常常听到的一个问题是：“为什么科学家们愿意制造大规模毁灭性的武器呢？”我是可以体会发问人的这种观点的。过去九年来的局势应该使得即使是最不关心政治的科学工作者停下来想一想他的工作的含意，至于我个人，我是愿意看到各国的科学家们停止制造这种（大规模毁灭性的）武器的。
    柏贺浦说，各党各派的和无党派的绝大多数人民对于这次（美国在马绍尔群岛）试验（氢弹），都感到非常不安。他们希望停止这种试验。他们希望看到氢弹以及各种大规模毁灭性的武器受到禁止。
    甚至从军事观点来看，爆炸更大的氢弹似乎也没有什么好处。
    柏贺浦说，的确，现在是开始高级谈判以避免再作这种试验的时候了。柏贺浦并引用一九五三年八月二十日苏联政府关于氢弹试验的公告原文说明，苏联政府是愿意禁止各种大规模毁灭性的武器的。
  埃及外交部长发表声明
    拥护禁止原子武器的主张
    埃及广播电台八日广播了埃及外交部部长法齐的一篇声明。声明说：“埃及人民和政府坚决拥护禁止原子武器。”声明还说，埃及将在联合国中继续努力谋求禁止原子武器。  （据新华社讯）
