    The Second National Congress of the Chinese Railway Trade Union Opens
    [Our Newspaper] The Second National Congress of the Chinese Railway Trade Union opened in Beijing on April 5th. A total of 385 formal delegates and observers attended the congress.
    Dong Biwu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the opening ceremony of the congress.
    Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, delivered the opening speech at the meeting, pointing out that the central task of this congress is to summarize the experience of the railway trade union work in the past four years, formulate the guiding principles and tasks of the railway trade union work during the period of national construction in accordance with the general line of the Party and the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union; discuss how to further study and implement the advanced experience of the China Changchun Railway, and elect the leading body of the Second Chinese Railway Trade Union, so as to further develop the railway workers' movement under the leadership of the Party.
    Comrade Dong Biwu, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, extended warm congratulations to the congress. He said that the Communist Party of China attached great importance to mobilizing and organizing railway workers to carry out the struggle against imperialism and feudalism in the early days of its establishment. The "February 7th" general strike led by railway workers under the leadership of the Party played a locomotive role in the national workers' movement. He instructed all railway workers to inherit and carry forward this glorious tradition, and to make more organized and disciplined struggles to realize the Party's general line during the transition period. The railway trade union organizations should further unite all employees and truly become a communist school, and strive to complete the transportation tasks given by the state and build a socialist society.

    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke at the meeting. He gave detailed instructions on learning from the Soviet Union, promoting the experience of the China Changchun Railway, improving technology in labor competitions, improving the technical level of employees, and carrying out mass technical innovation movements. At the same time, he also gave a brief explanation of the great significance of strengthening the unity of the working class and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.
    In the afternoon of the same day, the congress listened to the report by Wang Zhijie, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, on the summary of the work of the Chinese Railway Trade Union in the past four years and the tasks for the future.
