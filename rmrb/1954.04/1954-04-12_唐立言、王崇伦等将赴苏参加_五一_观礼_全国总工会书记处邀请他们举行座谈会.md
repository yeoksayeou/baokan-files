This visit to the Soviet Union will surely bring back many production experiences to your work posts. In their speeches, the labor models unanimously expressed that it was the greatest honor of their lives to be able to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day parade in the Soviet Union. They will definitely live up to the trust of the people of the motherland, learn from the Soviet Union with an open mind, and after returning to their work posts, they will work hard together with all the worker comrades to create and better fulfill the national construction plan. Wang Chonglun said: Under the cultivation and education of the Party, although I have made some creations in production in the past, I still have many shortcomings. This visit to the Soviet Union will definitely bring back the advanced experiences I see and learn to my work post, and exert greater power in the technological innovation movement. In his speech, Tang Liyan introduced the process of casting "anchor chains" in detail.
