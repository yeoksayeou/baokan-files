    Chinese Academy of Sciences to Send 200 Scientists for Field Investigations Nationwide
    East China Agricultural Science Institute to Conduct Large-Scale Rural Research

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences will send 200 scientists, including soil scientists, geographers, botanists, zoologists, entomologists, and aquatic biologists, to conduct field investigations across the country. Some of these scientists have already departed.

    The comprehensive development and fundamental treatment of the Yellow River is a massive, long-term undertaking of great significance to the entire national economy. Soil and water conservation work in the Northwest is a major link in the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River. Scientists will depart for the Northwest to collaborate with local scientific workers from the water conservancy, agriculture, and forestry sectors to further conduct various experimental research investigations into soil and water erosion and conservation.

    China has a long coastline, vast freshwater surfaces, and abundant aquatic resources. Marine biologists have already begun planned resource surveys. They are currently investigating fish, marine plants, and economically valuable invertebrates along the coasts of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. In the waters of North China, another group of scientists is cooperating with the Fisheries Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture to survey hairtail and mackerel fishing grounds, study changes in the marine environment and fish living habits, and seek fish migration routes in order to guide fisheries production and increase catches. Freshwater biologists are investigating the natural environment and biological conditions of lakes in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, studying methods for utilizing lakes to raise fish. Some typical lakes among those surveyed in Hubei Province in 1953 will be selected for stocking experiments, and larger-scale fish ecology research will begin. The success of this work will enable the utilization of vast lakes, providing a scientific basis for increasing aquatic production, and will also promote further improvement and development of aquatic biology.

    Entomologists are studying the natural environment of locust areas and the patterns of locust outbreaks in Weishan Lake, at the junction of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces. They will cooperate with various aspects of water conservancy construction and changes in farming systems to study changing the natural environmental conditions of locust outbreak areas, fundamentally seeking ways to eliminate locust plagues. In the Lesser Khingan Mountains of Northeast China, there are red pine forests stretching for hundreds of miles, and the Greater Khingan Mountains contain valuable coniferous trees. Entomologists will study forest pests in Northeast China, especially the damage caused by pine caterpillars, and methods for eliminating pests. In the area north of the Yellow River in Henan Province, entomologists will conduct experimental research work to eliminate cotton aphids and other cotton pests.

    Mammal experts will conclude their investigation of mammals in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area and prepare to move to the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area to observe the ecology and living habits of mammals. Ornithologists will continue to study the relationship between birds and orchards in the fruit-growing areas of northern Hebei Province. They will use artificial methods to attract beneficial birds to live in the orchards, while simultaneously devising ways to prevent harmful birds, increase orchard production, and begin investigating beneficial birds that peck locusts. In Anhui Province, mammal experts will conduct ecological research on the Chinese alligator, which endangers embankments, along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

    The East China Agricultural Science Institute is conducting large-scale rural research work in conjunction with agricultural production. More than seventy scientific and technical personnel, organized into four comprehensive research groups and nine specialized research groups, have recently departed for Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang provinces, and the suburbs of Shanghai to carry out research activities. They focus their research on increasing the production of rice, wheat, and cotton, and also pay attention to the research of vegetables and fruit trees.

    All research groups are primarily targeting state-owned farms and mutual aid cooperative organizations, conducting research work in a planned manner. For example, the rice comprehensive research group that arrived in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, is composed of thirteen scientific and technical personnel from fields such as food crops, soil, and agricultural implements. They have established base points at the state-owned Lianhu Farm and the Chen Hefa Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Erling electric irrigation area to study issues related to direct dry seeding of rice in mechanized cultivation on large areas of land, creating technical conditions for the agricultural cooperation and mechanization of rice-growing areas. The cotton comprehensive research group, composed of eight scientific and technical personnel from fields such as soil and plant protection, recently arrived in the saline-alkali cotton-growing areas of northern Jiangsu to cooperate with the state-owned Shanghai Farm, Huaihai Farm, and local mutual aid cooperative organizations to systematically study the technology of saline-soil improvement and large-scale mechanized cotton cultivation, and to conduct comprehensive control experiments on cotton pests.

    In order to meet the growing needs of urban people for non-staple foods, the East China Agricultural Science Institute has increased manpower this year to establish a vegetable cultivation technology research group, which will go to the suburbs of large cities such as Shanghai to systematically study the improvement of diverse vegetable cultivation technologies on large areas of land in conjunction with state-owned horticultural farms and agricultural production cooperatives, in order to increase supply and extend the supply season.

    A total of twelve technical personnel who went to the citrus-producing areas of Zhejiang Province and the apple-producing areas of Shandong Province will conduct research work to supply more and better fruits domestically and abroad.

    中国科学院将派出二百名科学工作者
    到全国各地进行野外调查工作
    华东农业科学研究所大规模地进行农村研究工作
    中国科学院将派出包括土壤学家、地理学家、植物学家、动物学家、昆虫学家及水生生物学家等二百名科学工作者，到全国各地进行野外调查工作。其中有些科学工作者已经出发。
    黄河全面开发及根治黄河是一个规模浩大的长期工作，对整个国民经济有重大意义。西北水土保持工作是根治黄河的主要环节之一。科学工作者将出发到西北，和当地的水利、农、林各部门的科学工作者结合，进一步进行各种不同的水土侵蚀和水土保持的试验研究调查工作。
    我国有漫长的海岸线，辽阔的淡水水面和富饶的水产资源，海洋生物学者已经开始了有计划的资源调查，他们正在广西、广东、福建沿海调查鱼类、海洋植物和经济无脊椎动物。在华北的海面上，另一批科学家和农业部水产实验所合作，勘察黄花鱼、鲐鱼渔场，研究海洋环境的变化和鱼类生活习性，寻求鱼群洄游的路线，以便指导渔业生产，提高渔获量。淡水生物学家在江苏、安徽省调查湖泊的自然环境和生物情况，研究利用湖泊放养鱼类的办法。一九五三年已经调查过的湖北省的湖泊，将挑出一些典型湖做放养试验，并将开始较大型湖的鱼类生态研究。这些工作的成功，将会使广大湖泊得到利用，成为提高水产产量的科学依据，并且也将促进水生生物学进一步的提高和发展。
    昆虫学家在山东、江苏两省交界的微山湖研究蝗区自然环境和蝗虫发生规律。他们将与水利建设和改变农作制度等各方面相配合来研究改变蝗虫发生地的自然环境条件，从根本上设法消除蝗灾。东北小兴安岭有蔓延数百哩长的红松林，大兴安岭蕴藏着有价值的针叶松柏树木。昆虫学家将在这里研究东北的森林虫害，尤其是松毛虫的为害情况和消灭虫害的办法。在河南省黄河北岸地带，昆虫学家将进行消灭棉蚜及其他棉虫的试验研究工作。
    兽类学家将结束小兴安岭林区兽类的调查，并准备转到大兴安岭林区去观察兽类的生态和生活习性。鸟类学家将继续在河北省北部果区研究鸟类和果园的关系。他们将利用人工方法诱引益鸟在果园生活，同时想法防除害鸟，增加果园生产，并开始研究啄食蝗虫的益鸟的调查。在安徽省，兽类学家将沿长江下游进行为害堤岸的中国鳄鱼的生态的研究。　（新华社）
    华东农业科学研究所结合农业生产大规模地进行农村研究工作。七十多个科学技术人员组成四个综合研究组和九个专业研究组，最近先后出发到江苏、安徽、山东、浙江等省和上海市郊区开展研究活动。他们以水稻、小麦和棉花的增产为研究中心，并注意对蔬菜、果树的研究。
    所有的研究组都以各地国营农场和互助合作组织为主要对象，有计划地进行研究工作。如到达江苏省丹阳县的水稻综合研究组，有食用作物、土壤、农具等方面的十三个科学技术人员参加，他们在国营练湖农场和珥陵电力灌溉区陈和法农业生产合作社建立基点，研究在大面积土地上机械化耕作过程中关于水稻旱直播等方面的问题，为水稻地区农业合作化机械化创造技术条件。由土壤和植物保护等方面的八个科学技术人员组成的棉花综合研究组，最近到达江苏北部盐垦棉区，配合国营上海农场、淮海农场以及当地互助合作组织有计划地研究盐土改良和大面积机械化栽培棉花的技术，并进行对棉虫的综合防治试验。
    为适应城市人民对副食品日益增加的需要，华东农业科学研究所今年增加人力成立蔬菜栽培技术研究组，到上海等大城市郊区结合国营园艺场和农业生产合作社，在大面积土地上有系统地研究多种多样蔬菜栽培技术的改进，以增加供应量，延长供应季节。
    分别到浙江省柑桔产区和山东省苹果产区的技术人员共有十二人，他们将为供应国内和国外更多更好的果类而进行研究工作。　（新华社）
