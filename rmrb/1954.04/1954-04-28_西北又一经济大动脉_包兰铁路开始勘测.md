Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 27th: The surveying of another economic artery in Northwest China—the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway—has begun.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway starts from Baotou in the western basin of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, advances southward along the Yellow River plain, passes through pastoral areas such as Ulanqab League and Yikezhao League, crosses the Yellow River, enters the Ningxia Plain along the Helan Mountains, reaches Yinchuan City, the capital of Ningxia Province, and then extends southwestward along the west bank of the Yellow River into Gansu Province, passes through the Great Wall, and crosses the Yellow River again to reach Lanzhou. The Baolan Railway is more than 1,000 kilometers long, connecting to the Tianlan Railway and Lanxin Railway in the west, and connecting to the Jingbao Railway in the east. After the completion of this railway, it will become the second major railway trunk line running across northern China, playing a significant role in prospering the northwestern border regions of our country and accelerating the exchange of materials between Northwest China, the interior of our country, and coastal areas.

The surveying work of the Baolan Railway began in 1950. The workers surveying the Bao (tou)-Ning (xia) section braved the cold weather outside the Great Wall and overcame numerous obstacles. They not only bravely crossed small and medium-sized ditches by jumping and using poles, but also often took off their clothes and waded across large canals and rivers. Once, when crossing a large canal, the water supply team members carried wooden boards and stood in the icy rapids to form a human bridge, allowing heavy water pumps and other equipment to pass over the human bridge. The geological team's hand-cranked drilling team sometimes worked from 8:00 in the morning until late at night to ensure the normal progress of exploration work. During reconnaissance and preliminary surveys, they put forward slogans such as "If there is a road, we must walk it; if there is a ditch, we must drill it; if there is a mountain, we must climb it; if there are people, we must visit them" and "The line is straight, the slope is small, the radius is large, and the cost is low," thus fully demonstrating collective wisdom and creativity.

    西北又一经济大动脉—包兰铁路开始勘测
    【新华社呼和浩特二十七日电】我国西北的又一经济大动脉——包头兰州铁路已经开始勘测。
    包兰铁路北起自内蒙古自治区西部盆地的包头，沿黄河大平原南进，途经乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟等畜牧区，跨过黄河，沿贺兰山脉进入宁夏平原，到达宁夏省会银川市，又沿黄河西岸向西南伸展进入甘肃省，穿过万里长城，再渡黄河到达兰州。包兰路全长一千多公里，西边与天兰路、兰新路相连，东边与京包路衔接。这条铁路建成后，将成为横贯我国北方的第二条大铁路干线，在繁荣我国西北边疆，加速西北和我国内地以及沿海各地物资交流上将起重大作用。
    包兰路勘测工作是从一九五零年开始的。勘测包（头）宁（夏）段的职工们，冒着塞外寒冷的天气，突破了重重阻碍，他们不仅用跳跃和撑竿等方法奋勇地跨过了中、小沟渠，而且经常脱衣涉水渡过大渠和河流。有次渡过大渠时，给水队人员曾抬着木板站在冰冷的急流里搭成人桥让笨重的抽水机等从人桥上通过去。地质队手摇钻机队，有时从上午八时开始工作一直坚持到深夜，保障了勘探工作的正常进行。他们在进行草测和初测时，曾提出“有路必走，有沟必钻，有山必上，有人必访”和“线路直，坡度小，半径大，花钱少”等口号，因而充分发挥了集体智慧和创造性。
