    Anshan, April 25th (from our newspaper) – The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has begun clearing the site for the second primary rolling mill system project. This is another huge new construction project following the completion of large and complex projects such as the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant last year. If the buildings of this project were to be connected in the future, they would be two li long, and one li wide at the widest point. In this project, the amount of earth backfilled into the low-lying areas alone is more than 2 million cubic meters, which is enough to fill more than 80,000 train cars weighing 30 tons each.
    The system engineering of this primary rolling mill is designed by the Soviet Union for us, and the equipment is also the most modern. Its output will be twice as large as the first primary rolling mill, which is currently being renovated, and three times as large as the large rolling mill. It will produce various large, medium, and small steel billets, which can meet the needs of Anshan Iron and Steel and many rolling mills across the country. It is of great significance for accelerating the realization of socialist industrialization in our country.
    Partial construction of this project will be carried out this year, which is a sign of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction moving forward. At the same time, it is also another serious test of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction technical strength. At present, the engineering companies that will participate in this huge construction are actively organizing their forces to prepare for construction.

    鞍山钢铁公司准备动工兴建现代化初轧厂
    【本报鞍山二十五日电】鞍山钢铁公司第二初轧厂系统工程开始进行厂基清扫工作。这是继去年大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂等巨大复杂的工程完成之后，又一个巨大的新建工程。假使将来把这个工程的厂房连在一起，将有两里长，最宽的地方也有一里。在这个工程中，仅向洼地回填的土方，就有二百多万立方公尺，这些土方可装载重三十吨的火车车皮八万多辆。
    这个初轧厂的系统工程，是苏联替我们设计的，设备也都是最新式的。它的产量，比现在正在改建的第一初轧厂要大一倍，比大型轧钢厂要大三倍。它将要生产各种大型、中型和小型的钢胚，可以满足鞍钢和全国许多轧钢厂的需要。对于加速实现我国社会主义工业化，有着很重大的意义。
    这个工程今年将进行部分施工，这是鞍钢基本建设向前迈进的一个标志。同时，也是对鞍钢基本建设技术力量的又一次严重的考验。现在，将要参加这一巨大建设的工程公司，都在积极地组织力量准备参加建设。
