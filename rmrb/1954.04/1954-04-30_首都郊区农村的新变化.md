    New Changes in the Rural Suburbs of the Capital
    Yu Ming
    The busy spring plowing season has arrived before the "May Day" holiday. This year, spring plowing in the suburbs of the capital is undergoing a tremendous change. On the surface, it is still plowing and sowing, but many of the cultivators are no longer individual farmers, but are appearing in the fields as members of agricultural production cooperatives. Last year, farmers in the suburbs who participated in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for only six per thousand of the total number of farm households, but before "May Day" this year, it has reached seven and four tenths percent of the total number of farm households. Among the 374 agricultural production cooperatives, 98 have already implemented land without dividend distribution. This is the foundation for all the changes that have taken place.
    Many agricultural production cooperatives have connected the land of hundreds of farmers into one piece. Before "May Day", the vegetable production cooperative in Baipenyao Township, the vegetable production cooperative in Huangtugang Township, and the vegetable production cooperative in Shuanghuaishu Township were all planting various vegetables needed to supply the people of the capital on hundreds of acres of land. Now, a large number of vegetable seedlings cultivated under reed mats are about to leave the crowded seedling beds and be transplanted to the vast and free fields to grow and develop. The state-owned Zhanghua Farm, the Red Star Collective Farm, the Shuanghuaishu Township Vegetable Production Cooperative, and many other cooperatives have planted apples, grapes, peach trees, and pear trees on dozens or even hundreds of acres of connected land. In the mountains and fields of the Jingxi Mining Area, various fruit trees are blooming with flowers. This year, farmers have planted a large number of fruit trees here again. In a few years, in addition to providing the capital's construction with abundant minerals, it will also become a beautiful orchard in the suburbs of the capital producing abundant fruit. In order to supply raw materials for the capital's newly built textile industry, the area for cotton planting in the suburbs has been expanded this year. The Red Star Collective Farm alone has sown excellent cotton seeds on 7,000 acres of land. The Zhang Guozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, which has more than 300 members, plans to plant more than 1,100 acres of peanuts this year. Many mutual aid teams and individual farmers are also expanding the planting area of vegetables, cotton, and oil crops under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives. Such large-scale planned production activities according to the needs of the capital's construction and people's lives are unprecedented for farmers in the suburbs of the capital.
    The Communist Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the consolidation and development of these agricultural production cooperatives. After the spring plowing and sowing began, many cadres were sent to the countryside to help farmers manage these "big businesses." Some professors and students from the Capital Agricultural School and scientific and technical personnel from various scientific research institutions have gone deep into the production teams of each cooperative, enthusiastically helping farmers improve production techniques in actual production. One morning, I saw such a moving scene at the Red Star Collective Farm, which owns tens of thousands of acres of land: after the chairman of the collective farm and the comrades of the work team watched the production teams go to the fields, they began to study the production plan of the entire farm. At this time, some agricultural technicians and old professors from the Agricultural University followed the production teams to the fields to guide production; some technicians and some farm members, representatives of nearby agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and some individual farmers held a forum on improving cotton production techniques in the conference room of the farm; a veterinarian and the farm's breeder squatted in front of the stable, studying how to improve the way of feeding livestock; in the farm office, a technician carefully made charts for the farm's five-year construction plan... More than 500 farm members and all the people who came here to help production formed a university for learning how to run socialist undertakings. On the eve of this year's "May Day", not only can you see this rare event in the farm, but also in many agricultural production cooperatives, you can meet such people who are working together for the socialist cause.
    Before "May Day", factories and supply and marketing cooperatives in the capital that manufacture agricultural machinery have transported a large number of production tools and means of production to the suburbs to supply farmers. However, farmers who are organized on a large scale still feel the lack of means of production and the backwardness of production tools. The old waterwheel, which takes one person and one animal power to irrigate only three acres of land every day, has become overwhelmed on the continuous thousands of acres of land. The millions of catties of vegetables produced by each vegetable production cooperative need to be transported by several or dozens of people and animals all year round. The Shuanghuaishu Township Vegetable Production Cooperative alone produces more than 8 million catties of vegetables a year, which requires more than a dozen rubber-wheeled carts to transport non-stop for a year to complete the transportation. Therefore, each cooperative urgently needs to improve transportation conditions and transportation tools. Cooperatives that plant a large number of vegetables need a large amount of chemical fertilizers. The Beijing Machine Tractor Station has cultivated land for some cooperatives this spring, but it is still far from the actual needs. Some members of several cooperatives told me with confidence that they had connected the land into a large piece, and this year is the first year. Next year and the year after, the land of the surrounding villages will be merged with their land, and then it will be necessary to use many electric wells (using electric power to pump water) to irrigate the land and many tractors to cultivate the land. On this year's "May Day", farmers in the suburbs felt more deeply that agriculture needs the help of industry. They reached out to their worker brothers and sisters for support, and they will also work harder to support their worker brothers and sisters in production.
    Before "May Day", the organized farmers in the suburbs enthusiastically discussed this year's production increase plan according to the needs of the country. Now, some production cooperatives have made the plan into charts: the Baipenyao Township Vegetable Production Cooperative and the state-owned Zhanghua Farm, which have more than 250 members, both plan to supply more than 10 million catties of vegetables to the capital this year; the Huangtugang Township Vegetable Production Cooperative plans to increase the yield per unit area of 19 kinds of vegetables by 41.1% this year; the Xiaotun Township Vegetable Production Cooperative plans to increase the maximum yield of cabbage to 24,000 catties; the Zhang Guozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative guarantees that this year's grain production will increase by 58%, and the yield per unit area of oil crops will increase by 35.9%... Farmers in the suburbs will use these charts to express their determination to work hard to increase agricultural production and support industrial construction to Chairman Mao and the workers and citizens of the capital on "May Day".
      Before "May Day", the production competition for completing these plans was launched enthusiastically by farmers in the suburbs. Many cooperatives greeted this festival of the great unity of the working people by completing the sowing work ahead of schedule.

    首都郊区农村的新变化
    于明
    “五一”节前，农村繁忙的春耕季节到来了。今年，首都郊区的春耕，正经历着一个巨大的变化。从表面上看，同样是耕地、播种，可是，许许多多的耕作者，已经再不是个体农民，而是以农业生产合作社社员的身份出现在田野里。去年，郊区农民参加农业生产合作社的只占总农户数的千分之六，今年“五一”前，已经达到总农户数的百分之七·四。三百七十四个农业生产合作社中，有九十八个社已经实行了土地不分红。这就是发生一切变化的基础。
    许多农业生产合作社，把数百户农民的土地连成了一片。“五一”节前，郊区白盆窑乡蔬菜生产合作社和黄土岗乡、双槐树乡蔬菜生产合作社，都在百余亩的土地上栽种供应首都人民需要的各种蔬菜。现在，在蒲席保护下培育起来的大批菜秧，即将离开那拥挤的秧畦，被移植到广阔自由的田地里发育生长。国营彰化农场、红星集体农庄、双槐树乡蔬菜生产合作社和其他许多合作社，都把数十亩以至数百亩相连的土地，栽植了苹果、葡萄、桃树和梨树。京西矿区的山野里，各种果树开满了鲜花。今年农民在这里又栽上了大批的果树。几年以后，这里除了可供给首都建设以丰富的矿产以外，还将成为首都郊区出产丰盛的美丽果园。为了供给首都新建的纺织工业原料，郊区今年棉花的种植面积扩大了，只是红星集体农庄，就在七千亩的土地上播下了优良棉种。拥有三百多户社员的张郭庄乡农业生产合作社，今年计划种一千一百多亩花生。许多互助组和个体农民，也在农业生产合作社的带动下，扩大蔬菜、棉花和油料作物的种植面积。这样大规模地按照首都建设和人民生活需要种植农作物，在首都郊区农民来说，是空前的有计划的生产活动。
    共产党和人民政府十分关心这些农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。春耕播种开始以后，许多干部被派下乡帮助农民经营这些“大家务”。首都农业学校的部分教授、学生和各种科学研究机关的科学技术人员，都深入到各个社的生产队，在实际生产中热心地帮助农民改进生产技术。一天上午，我在拥有上万亩土地的红星集体农庄，看到这样的动人景象：集体农庄主席和工作组的同志们，目送着一队队的生产队上地以后，就开始研究整个农庄的生产计划了，这时，一些农业技术人员和农业大学的老教授随着生产队上地指导生产；一些技术人员和部分庄员、附近农业生产合作社、互助组的代表以及一些单干农民，在农庄的会议室里举行着改进棉花生产技术的座谈会；一个兽医人员和农庄的饲养员蹲在马棚的前面，研究如何改进喂养牲口的办法；农庄办公室里，一个技术人员细心地为农庄制作五年建设计划的图表……，五百多户庄员和一切来到这里帮助生产的人们，组成了一个学习办社会主义事业的大学校。今年的“五一”节前夕，不但在农庄里可以看到这种过去少有的盛事，而且在许多农业生产合作社里，都可遇到这样一些为社会主义事业齐心努力的人们。
    “五一”节以前，首都制造农业机器的工厂和供销合作社，已经把大量生产工具和生产资料运送到郊区供应农民。可是，大规模组织起来的农民，还是感到生产资料的缺乏和生产工具的落后。每日费去一个人工和一个畜力只浇三亩地的旧有水车，在连绵千百亩的土地上，已经显得力不胜任；每个蔬菜生产合作社生产的千百万斤蔬菜，要用数个或数十个人力畜力常年运输，只是双槐树乡蔬菜生产合作社，一年生产的蔬菜就有八百多万斤，要十数辆胶皮车不停地运送一年才能运完，所以，各社迫切地需要改进运输的条件和运输的工具；大量种植蔬菜的合作社，需要大量的化学肥料；北京机器拖拉机站今春为一些合作社代耕了土地，但是，距离实际需要还是很远。有几个合作社的社员，都满怀信心地对我说，他们把土地连成一大片，今年还是头一年。明年后年，周围村庄的土地就要和他们的土地合在一起，那时就非用许多电井（用电力抽水）浇地、许多拖拉机耕地不可了。今年的“五一”节，郊区农民们更加深切感到农业需要工业的帮助，他们向工人兄弟伸出了要求支援的手，他们也将更加努力支援工人兄弟们生产。
    “五一”节前，郊区有组织的农民，按照国家需要，热烈地讨论了今年的增产计划。现在有些生产合作社，已经把计划制成了图表：有二百五十多户社员的白盆窑乡蔬菜生产合作社和国营彰化农场，今年都计划供应首都一千多万斤蔬菜；黄土岗乡蔬菜生产合作社，今年要把十九种蔬菜的单位面积产量提高百分之四十一点一；小屯乡的蔬菜生产合作社计划把白菜的最高产量提高到二万四千斤；张郭庄乡农业生产合作社保证今年粮食增产百分之五十八，油料作物提高单位面积产量百分之三十五点九……。郊区农民将用这些图表，在“五一”节向毛主席、向首都工人和市民表达自己努力提高农业生产、支援工业建设的决心。
      “五一”节前夕，郊区农民为完成这些计划的生产竞赛热烈地展开了，许多社都以提前完成播种工作，来迎接这一劳动人民大团结的节日。
