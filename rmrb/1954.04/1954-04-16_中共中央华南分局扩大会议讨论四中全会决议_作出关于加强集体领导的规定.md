Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 14th: The CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau held an enlarged meeting from March 17th to April 8th to convey the resolution of the CCP's Seventh Central Committee Fourth Plenary Session. The first stage of the meeting was held simultaneously with the enlarged meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Central South Military Region Party Committee. At the meeting, Tan Zheng, Political Commissar of the Central South Military Region, and Tao Zhu, Acting Secretary of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, delivered reports on conveying the resolution of the CCP's Seventh Central Committee Fourth Plenary Session. Based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution, the meeting conducted inspections and discussions on the issues of Party unity and the collective leadership of the Sub-bureau, and Tao Zhu made a summary. The meeting proceeded from beginning to end in a serious and earnest atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism. The comrades present spoke extensively and unanimously supported the report of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee to the Seventh Central Committee Fourth Plenary Session and the "Resolution on Enhancing Party Unity" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session, believing that this resolution was completely correct, necessary, and timely.

The meeting believed that the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution played a significant role in overcoming the "peaceful complacency" lacking revolutionary vigilance that existed within the Party in the South China region, and in recognizing the importance of strengthening Party unity. The comrades present conducted serious self-examination and unanimously agreed that since the South China Party organization opposed right-leaning thought in land reform and opposed localism and decentralism, the unity of all comrades under the correct political line and correct organizational line of the Party Central Committee had been greatly enhanced. However, Party unity was not perfect, and individualistic thinking unfavorable to Party unity still existed to varying degrees; in particular, Party comrades lacked sufficient understanding of the necessity to strengthen Party unity in order to defeat the enemy's conspiracy to create division and factional activities within our Party and to find agents, which was precisely what the South China Party organization, located on the front lines of national defense, must pay full attention to and be highly vigilant against. The meeting believed that when conveying and organizing the study of the documents of the CCP's Seventh Central Committee Fourth Plenary Session to Party members and cadres, it was necessary to seriously examine and overcome any remarks and actions that were detrimental to Party unity, based on the resolution; blind sectarian emotions, liberalist ideas, and individual pride that grew after achievements in work must be corrected, so that all Party comrades in South China could further enhance revolutionary vigilance and strengthen Party unity.

Regarding the issue of collective leadership, the meeting believed that in order to realize the principle of the Party's collective leadership, it was necessary to resolutely oppose the individual pride that had grown within the Party in the South China region due to certain achievements in work over the past few years, and to oppose the erroneous tendencies of individual prominence and individual worship arising from exaggerating the role of the individual, and even regarding the regions and departments under one's leadership as personal capital and independent kingdoms, etc., because if these errors were not corrected, they would inevitably create favorable conditions for political careerists to engage in activities. Based on the above spirit, the comrades present examined the collective leadership of the Sub-bureau Committee, believing that the Sub-bureau was basically normal in observing the principle of collective leadership and had paid attention to opposing individual prominence and individual worship. However, in order to further strictly guarantee the implementation of the principle of collective leadership, the meeting believed that the high-level leading organs of the Party, such as the South China Sub-bureau, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, and the Party Committees of various regions in Guangdong, must implement the following regulations: 1. Ensure that all major issues are subject to substantive, rather than formal, collective discussions by the Party Committee and the Standing Committee, and strive to ensure that major issues are fully deliberated and discussed collectively, in order to rely on the collective experience and collective wisdom of the Committee to make decisions as properly as possible and to ensure a high degree of ideological unity. 2. The secretaries and deputy secretaries should form the leading core of the Standing Committee and collectively handle the daily work of the leading organs, so that many things are not handled solely by the Party Committee Secretary, but are researched collectively by this core group to ensure that they are handled more appropriately. 3. Hold Party Committees, Party Representative Conferences, and Party Congresses on schedule, promote democracy, conduct criticism and self-criticism, examine work, and decide on major policies and guidelines. 4. All senior Party cadres must participate in the Party branch life as ordinary Party members, accept the criticism and supervision of the branch and the masses of Party members; at the same time, senior cadres in the same organ should also hold regular meetings of criticism and self-criticism in order to encourage each other and enhance unity.

    中共中央华南分局扩大会议讨论四中全会决议
    作出关于加强集体领导的规定
    【新华社广州十四日电】中共中央华南分局在三月十七日到四月八日举行扩大会议，传达中共七届四中全会的决议。会议的前一阶段是和中国人民解放军中南军区党委扩大会议同时举行的。会上先后听取了中南军区政治委员谭政和中共中央华南分局代书记陶铸关于中共七届四中全会决议的传达报告。会议根据四中全会决议的精神，就党的团结问题和分局的集体领导问题，进行了检查和讨论，并由陶铸做总结。会议自始至终在严肃认真和开展批评与自我批评的空气中进行。到会同志普遍发言，一致拥护中共中央政治局向七届四中全会的报告及四中全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，认为这一决议是完全正确的、必要的和及时的。
    会议认为四中全会的决议对于克服华南区党内现存的缺乏革命警惕性的“太平无事观念”，对于必须增强党的团结的重要性的认识，起了极大的作用。到会同志进行了认真的检查，一致认为华南党的组织自从反对了土地改革中的右倾思想和反对地方主义、分散主义以后，全体同志团结在党中央正确的政治路线和正确的组织路线下，党内的团结是大大增进了。但是，党的团结并不是十全十美的，不利于党的团结的个人主义思想在不同程度上还是比较普遍地存在着；特别是党内同志对于必须增强党的团结以击败敌人在我们党内制造分裂、制造派别活动、寻找代理人的阴谋毒计的认识是很不够的，而这正是地处国防前线的华南党组织所必须充分注意和高度警惕的。会议认为在向党员干部进行传达和组织学习中共七届四中全会文件时，必须特别根据决议，认真检查和克服不利于党的团结的任何言论和行动；对盲目宗派情绪、自由主义思想以及工作取得成绩后滋长着的个人骄傲情绪必须纠正，以便使华南全党同志更加提高革命警惕性，更加增强党的团结。
    关于集体领导问题，会议认为要实现党的集体领导原则，必须坚决反对华南区党内由于几年来工作上获得若干成绩而滋长着的个人骄傲情绪，反对由于夸大个人作用而产生的个人突出和个人崇拜，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国等等错误倾向，因为这些错误如不纠正，就必然会给政治野心家制造便利的活动条件。到会同志根据上述精神检查了分局委员会的集体领导，认为分局在遵守集体领导的原则方面基本上是正常的，对反对个人突出、个人崇拜是有所注意的。但为了进一步严格保证集体领导原则的贯彻，会议认为华南分局、广西省委、广州市委和广东各区党委这些党的高级领导机关，必须实行下列各项规定：一、保证一切重大问题都经过党的委员会、常委会的切实的而不是形式的集体讨论，力求重大问题都经过集体的充分酝酿、讨论，以便依靠委员会的集体经验和集体智慧，达到尽可能妥善地作出决定，和保证高度的思想一致。二、书记和副书记应组成为常委会的领导核心，集体地处理领导机关的日常工作，以便许多事情不是仅仅由党委书记一个人来处理，而是经过这个核心集体研究以保证处理得更为妥善。三、按期开好党的委员会、党的代表会议和党的代表大会，发扬民主，进行批评和自我批评，检查工作，决定重大政策、方针问题。四、党的高级干部一律要以普通党员的身份参加党的支部生活，接受支部和党员群众的批评和监督；同时，在同一机关里的高级干部之间，也应定期举行批评和自我批评的会议，以便互相鞭策，增进团结。
