The Braille books printed with new Braille script by the Department of Blind and Deaf Education of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education began to be distributed in late March. The first published books include three types: "Extracurricular Reading Materials for Blind Children's Schools" for senior and middle grades, and "Selected Songs." This new Braille script was created by the blind person Huang Nai. Its characteristic is the use of word separation in writing, which makes it much easier to recognize by touch than the old Braille script that used simple phonetic symbols.

The Braille books published this time are printed using the letterpress printing method advocated by the blind person Li Ding. This type of printing can be applied by slightly modifying ordinary printing presses. Trial printing results proved that this method can not only print on one side, but also print neat raised dots on both sides, as beautiful as Braille books printed by foreign countries using specially made Braille printing presses.

The government publishing Braille books is a first in Chinese history. In old China, imperialist elements, in order to use religion to numb our country's blind people, once published the "Bible" in the old Braille script. The Kuomintang reactionary government never cared about the textbooks and general reading materials needed by blind people. All blind schools have always used the method of hand-copying, spending one-third or even half of their teaching time copying textbooks. The lessons could not be completed, and teachers and students felt great difficulties. Last spring, when the blind person Li Ding successfully experimented with letterpress printing of Braille and sent the first letterpress-printed "Who are the Most Beloved People" in the old Braille script to various blind schools and blind people's training centers, the blind people were very excited. When the Braille Compilation Group led by the Department of Blind and Deaf Education of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education was established last October, blind people from all over the country wrote letters asking about publishing news and expressing their infinite gratitude to the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao.

The Braille books published this time are all printed on high-quality thick paper with exquisite printing and sold at the lowest possible price. Future Braille books to be published successively include "Reader of Political Common Sense" and its reference materials, "Introduction to New Braille Script," and some primary school textbooks. Due to the small and scattered demand for Braille books, these Braille books are uniformly distributed by the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中央教育部盲哑教育处  用新盲字编印多种盲文书籍

    中央教育部盲哑教育处
    用新盲字编印多种盲文书籍
    中央人民政府教育部盲哑教育处用新盲字编印的盲文铅印书籍，已在三月下旬开始发行。第一次出版的书籍有高年级和中年级的“盲童学校课外读物”、“歌选”等三种。这种新盲字是盲人黄乃创造的，它的特点是采用分词写法，比采用简单的注音符号的旧盲字，在摸认上方便很多。
    这次出版的盲文书籍，是采用盲人李玎倡议的铅字活版印刷方法印刷的。这种印刷，只需将普通印刷机略加改装，便可应用。试印的结果证明：用这种方法不仅能印单面，也能两面印出整齐的凸点，和外国用特制的盲文印刷机印出的盲书一样漂亮。
    由政府出版盲文书籍，在我国历史上还是第一次。在旧中国，帝国主义分子为了利用宗教来麻醉我国盲人，曾用旧盲字出版过“圣经”，国民党反动政府对于盲人所需的教科书和一般读物从不过问，所有的盲校一向沿用手抄的方法，花费了教学时间三分之一甚至一半去抄课本，功课教不完，师生都感到很大困难。去年春天，盲人李玎试验铅印盲文成功，将第一次用旧盲字铅印的“谁是最可爱的人”寄送给各盲校和盲人教养院时，盲人们非常兴奋。当中央人民政府教育部盲哑教育处领导的盲文编译组于去年十月成立时，各地盲人纷纷写信询问出版消息，并对共产党、人民政府和毛主席表示无限感激。
    这次出版的盲文书籍，都是用上等厚纸精印，以最低廉的价格出售。今后将陆续出版的盲文书籍还有“政治常识读本”及其参考资料、“新盲字入门”以及一部分小学课本。由于盲文书籍的需要量少而分散，这些盲文书籍都由新华书店北京分店统一发行。  （新华社）
