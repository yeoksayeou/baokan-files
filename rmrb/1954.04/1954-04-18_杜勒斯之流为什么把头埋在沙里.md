Why are the Dulles Clique Burying Their Heads in the Sand?
Hu Sisheng

Recently, with the Geneva Conference approaching, American reactionary politicians, led by Dulles, have been desperately spreading an atmosphere of hostility toward the Chinese people and denying the significant role of People's China in resolving international issues. Dulles stubbornly clings to the straw that "the Geneva Conference is not a Five-Power Conference," even though the Berlin Conference agreement clearly states that the five major powers, not four or three, will participate in the discussions on both Korean and Indochinese issues. At the end of March, the United States Congress even deliberately published a "report" from its "investigation" team in Southeast Asia last year, which clamored that "Communist China must not be recognized or allowed to join" any international organization. The chairman of this "investigation team," reactionary Congressman Walter Judd, even hysterically shouted that "methods must be found" to "weaken and destroy Communist China."

The recent loud and frequent clamoring of American reactionaries is, of course, for a reason. As everyone knows, the convening of a conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China as one of the five major powers itself signifies a step forward towards improving relations between major powers and easing international tensions. Therefore, after the Berlin Conference, people from all walks of life in various countries (including some more sober-minded members of the ruling groups in Western European capitalist countries) have increasingly called for the restoration of China's legitimate status within the United Nations and in international relations as a whole. Public opinion in various countries has concluded from the facts and the Berlin Conference agreement that ignoring the significant role of the People's Republic of China as a major power in resolving pressing international issues (especially Asian issues) is not feasible. In this situation, the American ruling group seems to find itself increasingly isolated. Therefore, they are desperately trying to diminish the significance of the Geneva Conference as a conference of major power consultations, desperately closing their eyes and refusing to recognize the great power status of the People's Republic of China. When an ostrich feels afraid, it buries its head in the sand, thinking that the world ceases to exist; the clamoring of the Dulles clique is clearly a reflection of America's desperate struggle under the pressure of world public opinion.

It should be reminded to these politicians that, whether it is slander or "non-recognition" or "not a Five-Power conference," the 500 million Chinese people and their people's country will not only never disappear from the earth, but will also firmly advance along the broad road of peaceful construction and increasing strength.

It is worth noting that the clamoring of the Dulles clique shows that the American ruling group is still stubbornly continuing its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people and maintaining international tensions. However, anyone with a little foresight can see clearly that this approach by the United States is obviously a waste of effort. The American ruling group should remember a famous Western proverb: "He who refuses to learn his lesson must pay the price to learn it."

    杜勒斯之流为什么把头埋在沙里
    胡思升
    近来，随着日内瓦会议的日益临近，以杜勒斯为首的美国反动政客们拚命地散布敌视中国人民、抹煞人民中国在解决国际问题中的重大作用的空气。杜勒斯一口咬住“日内瓦会议不是五大国会议”这根稻草不放，虽然柏林会议协议上明明写着同时参加朝鲜和印度支那问题讨论的将是五大国，而不是四大国或三大国。美国国会在三月底更别有用心地发表了它的一个“调查”小组去年在东南亚地区的“调查报告”，这个报告叫嚷“一定不要承认共产党中国或准许其加入”任何国际组织。这个“调查小组”的主席、反动议员周以德更歇斯底里地叫嚣“必须找出”方法来“削弱和摧毁共产党中国”。
    美国反动人物近来所以吵嚷得如此厉害和频繁，这当然是有其原因的。大家知道，召开有中华人民共和国在内的五大国参加的会议本身，就意味着朝向改善大国关系和缓和国际紧张局势前进了一步。因此，柏林会议后，各国广大阶层人士（包括西欧资本主义国家统治集团中一部分头脑较为清醒的人士）要求恢复中国在联合国组织内和整个国际关系中的合法地位的呼声日益高涨。各国舆论都从事实中和柏林会议协议中得出结论：忽视中华人民共和国作为大国在解决迫切的国际问题（特别是亚洲的问题）中的重大作用是行不通的。在这种情况下，美国统治集团似乎发现自己越来越陷于孤立了。因此，他们拚命要贬低日内瓦会议作为大国协商会议的意义，拚命地闭上眼睛拒绝承认中华人民共和国的大国地位。鸵鸟在觉得害怕时，就把头埋在沙土里，他以为这样世界就不存在了；杜勒斯之流的叫嚷，显然是美国在世界舆论压力下作绝望挣扎的反映。
    应该提醒这些政客们，诬蔑也好，“不承认”也好，不是“五大国”也好，五亿中国人民及其人民的国家不仅永远不会从地球上消失掉，而且将坚定地沿着和平建设和日益强大的康庄大道前进。
    值得注意的是：杜勒斯之流的叫嚷，说明美国统治集团仍然在顽固地继续执行敌视中国人民、保持国际紧张局势的政策。但是，稍有远见的人都看得很清楚：美国这种做法显然是白费力气的。美国统治集团应该记住西方的一句有名的谚语：“谁拒绝接受教训，谁就要付出代价来学到这个教训”。
