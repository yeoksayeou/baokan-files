Holding Lectures on Marxism-Leninism for Engineering Technicians: Gains and Experiences
中共旅大市委宣传部 (Propaganda Department of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee)

    In order to raise the theoretical level and political consciousness of engineering technicians, and to enable them to consciously participate in national economic construction, we organized city-wide lectures on Marxism-Leninism for engineering technicians in September 1953, absorbing the main engineering technicians from various factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the city to participate in the study. It was stipulated that Chapters IX to XII of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and a portion of "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" would be used as teaching materials. It was required that through this study, engineering technicians would understand the basic knowledge of the Soviet Union's realization of national socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and completion of socialist construction, so as to recognize the outline of our country's future development and enhance their confidence in their work.

    Based on this requirement, after deliberation, mobilization, and voluntary registration, there are currently 893 students participating in the study, including 460 party members and 196 members of the Communist Youth League. Their educational levels are: 675 university graduates, 148 junior college graduates, 33 high school graduates, and 37 with junior high school or lower education; their positions are: 246 engineers, 139 technicians, 224 technical staff, 199 doctors, and 85 others (laboratory technicians, planners, etc.). Since the start of the semester, ten lectures have been given, and Chapter IX of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the general line of our country's transition period have been studied.

    Over the past six months, our gains from holding Marxism-Leninism lectures are as follows:

    I. We have found a better way to organize theoretical study for the city's main engineering technicians.

    Lüda City is an industrial city with a considerable number of engineering technicians. In the process of realizing national socialist industrialization, engineering technicians occupy a very important position. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the political and theoretical education of engineering technicians. However, the past situation of theoretical study for engineering technicians in Lüda City was unsatisfactory. Factories, mines, and enterprises generally adopted two methods to organize theoretical study for engineering technicians: one was to organize engineering technicians and general cadres to study separately. Units that did this generally had more engineering technicians and stronger leadership from the Party committee. However, due to heavy production tasks, the Party committee could not take good care of them, which made theoretical education unsystematic, the quality of lectures and theoretical guidance did not meet the requirements of the engineering technicians, and the study could not be sustained for a long time. The other was to organize engineering technicians and general cadres to study together. There were more units that adopted this method. These units generally had fewer engineering technicians and it was not appropriate to organize them to study separately. However, there were also many shortcomings to adopting this method. First, in terms of study time, engineering technicians could not be the same as general cadres; second, in terms of lecturing and organizing discussions, they were different from general cadres due to their lower theoretical level and higher cultural level. Moreover, they generally had unrealistic ideas, and were unwilling to participate in lower-level classes, but could not learn if they participated in higher-level classes. Therefore, the technical personnel participating in the study in these units felt that they had not gained much and their enthusiasm for learning was not high. In addition, individual units simply did not organize theoretical study for engineering technicians and let them drift.

    Judging from the past learning situation in various units, it was difficult and ineffective to organize engineering technicians to carry out theoretical learning separately. Now, we have adopted the method of holding Marxism-Leninism lectures, absorbing the city's main engineering technicians to participate in the study, which has initially overcome these difficulties. The lectures are led by the Municipal Party Committee, with unified centralized lectures and decentralized self-study. This overcomes the difficulties of low lecture quality and weak learning guidance forces in decentralized study in various units. At the same time, it is also convenient to carry out education according to the characteristics and ideological conditions of engineering technicians. At present, the engineering technicians participating in the Marxism-Leninism lectures account for 30% of the city's engineering technicians.

    II. To a certain extent, the theoretical level and awareness of engineering technicians have been improved.

    Through the study of Chapter IX of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and the general line of the transition period, most of the students have initially acquired the basic knowledge of socialist construction and recognized the great significance of our country's development prospects and the general line of the transition period. For example, at the beginning of studying the general line, many people had many erroneous and vague understandings of our country's industrialization policy. Some people thought: "Developing heavy industry first requires a lot of funds, has low profits, and the products cannot meet the needs of the people; if we start with developing light industry, we can improve the people's material and cultural level more quickly." However, after several months of study, this problem has been basically solved in a considerable part of the technical personnel, and everyone has recognized the great significance of developing heavy industry to consolidate national defense and promote the socialist transformation of the entire national economy.

    Because of the improved understanding of these issues, they further realized the importance of the responsibilities and roles of technical personnel in realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and increased their enthusiasm for work. For example, after clarifying the importance of developing heavy industry, the technical personnel of Dalian Iron and Steel Plant realized the close relationship between the plant's production and national defense construction and national industrialization. They realized that the quality of their work directly affected the progress of the country's socialist construction. Therefore, they put forward their tasks in the transition period: "Accelerate the ideological remolding of self, actively and consciously examine and eliminate the capitalist enterprise management methods and technical viewpoints, humbly learn the Soviet socialist enterprise management methods and advanced technology, and constantly improve work to adapt to the needs of the country." Many people are also excited about every job and every minute of work after clarifying the country's development prospects. Some said: "When I know that the building of the socialist society also has a brick I personally moved, I feel very honored." Some expressed that they would dedicate all their strength to the socialist society.

    In addition, many people examined their thoughts and work during the learning process. The engineering technicians of Lüda factories and mines are mostly from other places. In the past, many people were not at ease with their work, especially the engineering technicians in the capital construction department, who thought that capital construction work was hard, irregular, and highly mobile, and asked to transfer their work, and individual ones asked to return to their hometown; some young engineering technicians were unwilling to work in the original enterprise, thinking that working in the "old" enterprise had no "future," and it was better to go to Anshan Iron and Steel, where they could learn a lot of new technologies and become "famous" engineers in the future, so they asked to change jobs; Individual engineering technicians have serious mercenary views, calculate salaries, status, and demand excessive treatment. Through the study of the general line, these individualistic ideas have been criticized to a certain extent, and they have initially learned about the relationship between individual interests and national interests, and the situation of some people who are not at ease with their work has also been initially overcome.

    III. Engineering technicians have begun to develop the habit of studying theory and increased their interest in studying theory, laying the foundation for future theoretical studies.

    After this stage of study, due to the planned organization of lectures and seminars and discussions, the quality of lectures has also been greatly improved compared with the past decentralized lectures in various units. At the same time, the study of the general line has provided convenient conditions for linking with reality. Therefore, the majority of students have realized the relationship between theoretical study and ideological remolding and improving work, thereby increasing their interest in theoretical study. Most of the technical personnel have basically overcome the phenomenon of being unwilling to participate in theoretical study and corrected various incorrect views on theoretical study. Now, the engineering technicians participating in the study can generally attend lectures on time, read reference materials, and abide by the study system. Among them, some backbone elements have emerged, and they have played a certain role in promoting the learning of other engineering technicians.

    We have the following experiences in organizing and leading the political and theoretical study of engineering technicians:

    I. In carrying out Marxism-Leninism education for engineering technicians, we must adhere to the policy of positive education and carry out enlightenment education based on their ideological conditions.

    The ideological conditions of the engineering technicians participating in the study vary. Some of them have more serious fame and fortune ideas and conservative ideas, are deeply influenced by bourgeois technical viewpoints, and have greater ideological obstacles to accepting new things and theoretical study; some are not deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, and have been tempered by practical work and educated and influenced by the new society. Basically, they are willing to learn Soviet advanced science and technology and are willing to learn political theory; some have more progressive ideas, are willing to endure hardships, are willing to learn from Soviet advanced experience and learn from workers, and accept new things quickly, but lack practical work experience. They are active participants in theoretical study and the backbone of learning. These situations illustrate the complexity of teaching. Therefore, teachers are required not only to expound theoretical issues when lecturing, but also to educate and criticize appropriately against the students' ideological conditions and their erroneous viewpoints in order to achieve better learning results.

    The key to doing this work well is to grasp the ideological situation of engineering technicians in a timely manner. In the past, some units adopted a rough and purely critical attitude towards the erroneous views of engineering technicians, which made many engineering technicians unwilling to contact ideas and dare not truly expose their thoughts in learning. This time we paid attention to this issue. First of all, we emphasized that engineering technicians should give full play to their free thinking in learning and not arbitrarily put labels on them. Therefore, they fully exposed their thoughts during the study of the general line. For example, on the issue of industrialization policy, some people advocated that industrialization should start from light industry for their own different reasons; when the lecturer lectured, he conducted education from a positive perspective, clarified the truth and then appropriately criticized them, that is, persuaded people with reason. According to the reflection of several lectures, the effect of this teaching is good. They are easy to accept and are sincerely convinced.

    II. Organizing engineering technicians to study theory must proceed from their actual situation.

    When organizing engineering technicians to study theory, we cannot demand too much at the beginning, but must proceed from their theoretical level, level of awareness, work conditions and other actual situations. In Lüda City, the general engineering technicians are more indifferent to politics, and in addition to the heavy work tasks, many people are unwilling to participate in extracurricular activities or political and theoretical studies. Based on these situations, we paid attention to the following points when organizing lectures: (1) Do not take up too much study time, so that it will not affect the technical personnel's research on technology. We stipulate that technical personnel use three hours of their spare time every week for theoretical study (including lectures). Facts have proved that this regulation is appropriate; (2) Emphasize voluntary participation in study, and do not force or demand uniformity, otherwise it will cause adverse effects;
    (3) Determine the content of the lectures according to the theoretical level of the students, and it should not be too deep; (4) In terms of learning methods, it is stipulated that lectures and self-study should be equally emphasized. Self-study should be carried out on the basis of lectures, and a study experience report should be written after each chapter is completed to assess the learning results and urge learning.

    III. Unified leadership, division of labor and responsibility.

    While concentrating the city's engineering technicians to study together, we must obtain the cooperation of Party committees at all levels. Because the work of the lectures themselves is only a part of the education work for technical personnel, students also carry out self-study, group activities, etc. in various units, so we must adopt the principle of unified leadership, division of labor and responsibility. The Municipal Party Committee is responsible for unified leadership, determining teaching materials, preparing study plans, hiring teachers, organizing lectures, grasping the progress of study, exchanging learning experiences, etc.; as for the specific leadership of the study of technical personnel in various units, it is the responsibility of the study committee or study group elected by the students themselves. The establishment of such a study committee or study group can give play to the spirit of independent responsibility of engineering technicians. The members of the study committee and the group leaders can directly understand the ideological situation of the technical personnel and report to the Party committee frequently, so that the Party committee can easily grasp the ideological situation of the students and understand the problems existing in the study, so as to solve and strengthen supervision and inspection in a timely manner.

    举办工程技术人员马克思列宁主义讲座的收获和经验
    中共旅大市委宣传部
    为了提高工程技术人员的理论水平和政治觉悟，使他们自觉地参加国家经济建设工作，我们于一九五三年九月组织了全市性的工程技术人员马克思列宁主义讲座，吸收了全市各厂矿、企业中主要工程技术人员参加学习。规定“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章和“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”的一部分著作为讲授教材。要求通过这一学习，使工程技术人员了解苏联实现国家的社会主义工业化、农业集体化和完成社会主义建设的基本知识。以便认识我国将来发展的轮廓，增强工作信心。
    根据这一要求，经过酝酿、动员和自愿报名，参加学习的学员现有八百九十三名，其中党员四百六十名，团员一百九十六名。他们的文化程度是：大学六百七十五名，专科一百四十八名，高中三十三名，初中以下三十七名；职别是：工程师二百四十六名，技师一百三十九名，技术员二百二十四名，医师一百九十九名，其他（化验员、计划员等）八十五名。自开学至今，已讲授了十讲，学习了“联共（布）党史”第九章及我国过渡时期的总路线。
    半年来，我们举办马克思列宁主义讲座的收获有如下三方面：
    一、找到了组织全市主要工程技术人员进行理论学习的较好的方式。
    旅大市是工业城市，工程技术人员相当多，而在实现国家的社会主义工业化过程中，工程技术人员所占的地位是很重要的，因此，必须加强工程技术人员的政治理论教育。但是，旅大市过去工程技术人员理论学习的状况是不能令人满意的。各厂矿、企业组织工程技术人员理论学习，大致采用这样两种方式：一种是工程技术人员与一般干部分别组织学习，这样的单位一般是工程技术人员多，党委领导力量较强。但由于生产任务繁重，党委不能很好照顾，这就使得理论教育进行得很不系统，讲课及理论指导的质量满足不了工程技术人员的要求，而且学习不能长期坚持。另一种是把工程技术人员和一般干部组织在一起学习，这样的单位较多。这些单位一般是工程技术人员少，不宜分别组织学习。但采用这种方式也有不少缺点。首先，在学习时间上，工程技术人员不能与一般干部相同；其次，在讲课及组织讨论上，因他们理论水平较低，而文化水平又较高，与一般干部也有所不同。并且，他们一般有好高骛远思想，不愿参加较低班级学习，参加较高班级学习又学不了。所以，这些单位参加学习的技术人员感到收获不大，学习情绪不高。此外，个别单位干脆不组织工程技术人员理论学习，任其自流。
    从过去各单位学习状况看来，分别组织工程技术人员进行理论学习，困难多，效果不大。而现在，我们采取举办马克思列宁主义讲座的办法，吸收全市主要工程技术人员参加学习，就初步克服了这些困难。讲座由市委领导，统一集中讲课，分散自学，这样克服了分散在各单位学习讲课质量不高、学习指导力量薄弱的困难，同时也便于根据工程技术人员的特点、思想情况进行教育。目前参加马克思列宁主义讲座学习的工程技术人员已占全市工程技术人员的百分之三十。
    二、在一定程度上提高了工程技术人员的理论水平和觉悟程度。
    通过了“联共（布）党史”第九章及过渡时期总路线的学习，大部分学员初步获得了社会主义建设的基本知识，认识了我国发展的前途和过渡时期总路线的伟大意义。如在学习总路线之初，很多人对我国工业化的方针存在许多错误和模糊认识。有的认为：“首先发展重工业需要资金多，赢利少，产品又不能满足人民需要；如果从发展轻工业开始就能更快提高人民物质文化水平。”但经这几个月来的学习，这问题在相当大的一部分技术人员中已基本获得解决，大家都认识了发展重工业对巩固国防和促进整个国民经济的社会主义改造的重要意义。
    由于对这些问题认识有所提高，他们进一步认识了技术人员在实现国家的社会主义工业化中责任和作用的重大，提高了工作热情。如大连钢铁厂的技术人员在明确了发展重工业的重要意义后，认识了本厂的生产与国防建设及国家工业化的密切关系，认识了自己工作的好坏都直接影响到国家社会主义建设工作的进展，因此他们提出了自己在过渡时期的任务是：“加速进行自我思想改造，积极地自觉地检查并清除资产阶级的企业管理方法和技术观点，虚心学习苏联社会主义企业管理方法及先进技术，不断改进工作，以适应国家的需要。”还有很多人在明确了国家的发展前途后，都为自己的每件工作、每分钟工作感到兴奋。有的说：“当我知道社会主义社会大厦建成也有我亲手搬的一块砖头的时候，我感到十分光荣。”有的表示要把自己的全力献给社会主义社会。
    另外，很多人在学习过程中检查了自己的思想和工作。旅大厂矿的工程技术人员多是外来的，过去有很多人不安心工作，特别是基本建设部门的工程技术人员，认为基本建设工作苦，不正规，流动性大，要求调动工作，个别的要求返乡；也有一部分年轻的工程技术人员，不愿在原有企业工作，认为在“旧”企业中工作没有“前途”，不如到鞍钢去，可以学到很多新技术，将来可以成为有“名望”的工程师，因此要求调换工作；个别工程技术人员存在严重的雇佣观点，计较薪资、地位，要求过高的待遇等。通过总路线学习，这些个人主义思想在一定程度上受到了批判，他们都初步了解到个人利益与国家利益的关系，一部分人不安心工作的情况也得到了初步的克服。
    三、使工程技术人员开始养成了学习理论的习惯，提高了学习理论的兴趣，为今后理论学习打下了基础。
    经过这一阶段的学习，由于有计划地组织讲课及座谈、讨论，讲课质量也比过去各单位分散进行大为提高，同时总路线的学习又提供了联系实际的便利条件，所以广大学员都认识到理论学习与改造思想、改进工作的关系，从而提高了理论学习的兴趣。大部分技术人员已基本上克服了不愿参加理论学习的现象，纠正了对理论学习各种不正确的看法。现在参加学习的工程技术人员一般都能按时参加听课，阅读参考材料，遵守学习制度。其中并涌现了一些骨干分子，他们对推动其他工程技术人员的学习起了一定的作用。
    我们在组织与领导工程技术人员政治理论学习过程中有如下几点体会：
    一、向工程技术人员进行马克思列宁主义教育必须坚持正面教育的方针，并根据其思想情况进行启发教育。
    参加学习的工程技术人员，思想情况各有不同，其中有的人有较严重的名利思想和保守思想，受资产阶级技术观点影响深，对接受新事物和理论学习存在较大的思想障碍；有的人受资产阶级影响不太深，又经实际工作的锻炼及新社会的教育与影响，基本上愿意学习苏联先进科学技术，愿意学习政治理论；有的人思想较进步，肯吃苦，愿意学习苏联先进经验和向工人学习，接受新事物快，但缺乏实际工作经验，他们是理论学习的积极参加者和学习的骨干。这些情况说明了教学工作的复杂性。因而要求教师讲课不仅仅是阐述理论问题，而且必须针对学员的思想情况及其错误观点进行教育并作适当批判，才能收到较好的学习效果。
    做好这一工作的关键乃是及时掌握工程技术人员的思想情况。过去某些单位对工程技术人员的错误观点采取了粗暴的单纯批判态度，致使很多工程技术人员在学习上不愿接触思想、不敢真实暴露思想。这次我们注意了这一问题。首先强调工程技术人员在学习上充分发挥自由思想，不随便乱扣帽子。所以他们在总路线学习过程中就较充分地暴露了思想。如关于工业化方针问题，有些人以各自不同的理由主张实现工业化应从轻工业开始；讲师讲课时就针对这些错误观点，从正面进行教育，在说清道理的基础上加以适当的批判，即以理服人。根据几次讲课反映，这样教学的效果良好。他们易于接受，而且心悦诚服。
    二、组织工程技术人员理论学习，必须从他们的实际情况出发。
    组织工程技术人员理论学习，开始时不能要求太高，必须从他们的理论水平、觉悟程度、工作状况等实际情况出发。旅大市一般工程技术人员不问政治倾向较严重，加以工作任务繁重，很多人不愿意参加业余活动或政治理论学习。根据这些情况，在组织讲座时，我们注意了下列几点：（一）不占用过多的学习时间，这样可以不影响技术人员对技术的钻研。我们规定技术人员每星期利用业余时间进行理论学习三小时（包括讲课在内），事实证明，这一规定是适当的；（二）强调自愿参加学习，不能勉强和强求划一，否则就引起不良效果；
  （三）根据学员理论水平决定讲课内容，不宜讲得过深；（四）在学习方法上规定讲课和自修并重，在讲课的基础上进行自修，每章学完后写学习心得一篇，以考核学习成绩和督促学习。
    三、统一领导，分工负责。
    在把全市工程技术人员集中起来学习的同时，必须取得各级党委的配合。由于讲座本身的工作只是向技术人员进行教育工作的一部分，学员除听课外，自修、小组活动等还都在各个单位进行，所以，必须采取统一领导，分工负责的原则。由市委统一领导，确定教材，编制学习计划，聘请教员，组织讲课，掌握学习进度，交流学习经验等；至于各单位技术人员学习的具体领导，乃是由学员自己选出的学委会或学习小组来负责。成立这样的学委会或学习小组，可以发挥工程技术人员独立负责的精神。学委会委员和小组长可以直接了解技术人员的思想情况，并经常向党委汇报，使党委易于掌握学员思想情况及了解学习上存在的问题，以便及时解决和加强督促检查。
