The United States is plotting to expand its interference in the Indochina War. In addition to attempting to force France to continue exchanging blood for dollars and accept the U.S.'s "takeover" of training Indochinese puppet troops, it is also actively plotting to drive Asian countries that receive U.S. aid to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the U.S. The U.S. "Wall Street Journal" blatantly revealed that the U.S. wants to usurp the banner of the United Nations in the Indochina War, as it did in Korea, and drive Asian member states of the United Nations to provide cannon fodder.

Recently, the U.S. has stepped up its conspiracy to use Thailand to expand the Indochina War, which is part of this sinister plan of the U.S.

Because the Phibun government has adopted a reactionary policy that violates Thailand's security and national interests, Thailand has become a tool for the U.S. to actively expand its influence in Southeast Asia and implement its plan to invade Asia. Through its so-called "aid" to the Phibun government, the U.S. is gradually controlling Thailand's political, economic, and military power, turning Thailand into a military base for aggression against Southeast Asia. Recently, with the U.S. expanding its interference in the Indochina War, Thailand is also being considered to be placed in this risky gamble. The U.S. "Business Week" openly stated on February 20th: "The United States is trying to support the region around Indochina as a supplement to U.S. aid to the battlefield. Thailand occupies a key position in this strategy."

As early as August 1953, the U.S. government's appointment of espionage chief Donovan as the U.S. ambassador to Thailand and "artillery and paratrooper expert" Gilmore as the head of the U.S. "Military Advisory Group" in Thailand harbored the U.S.'s secret plans in Thailand. At the time, the United Press revealed that Donovan's mission was to "ensure" that the U.S. and Thailand achieved "closer cooperation" in the U.S.'s steps to suppress the Indochinese national liberation movement.

At the same time, the U.S. stepped up its military "aid" to Thailand. According to Bangkok newspapers, the U.S. military "aid" to Thailand has exceeded $100 million in the past three years. In January of this year, when Donovan returned to Bangkok from Washington, he brought with him a concrete plan for the U.S. to further increase the Thai army with its assistance. The number of members of the U.S. "Military Training Mission" in Thailand has also been expanded to more than 300. The Phibun regime is also preparing to force all men between the ages of 18 and 55 to receive military training. Senior officials of the Thai government have also admitted that the Phibun regime has expressed its willingness to expand Thailand's cannon fodder to 200,000 for the U.S. On February 13th, the United Press stated that the U.S. is considering "aiding" Thailand with $50 million, and "this money can at least increase the training of two divisions and auxiliary troops."

The U.S. also instructed the Phibun government to step up the construction and expansion of Thailand's naval and air force bases. Nearly 30 airports have been expanded or are being expanded. Phibun has also begun preparing to transform 13 airports located in Chiang Mai, Phrae, and other places to make them suitable for use by U.S. high-speed giant aircraft. A new naval base is also being planned in the so-called "strategic coastline" of Chanthaburi Province. Phibun once said that when the U.S. "needs" it, "Thailand will allow the U.S. to use its military bases." Now, the Thai government is stepping up the construction of strategic highways leading to the Laotian border. The U.S. also instructed Thailand and the Cambodian puppet regime to start connecting the "militarily valuable" railway between Bangkok and Cambodia.

In this way, the purpose of the U.S. and the Phibun government in stepping up these military steps in Thailand is very obvious.

The Thai Phibun government actually learned the lying tongue of U.S. adventurers, shouting nonsense about so-called "communist expansion" in an attempt to deceive the Thai people and conceal the fact that Thailand is being dragged by the U.S. to the dangerous edge of interfering in the Indochina War.

Not only that, but the Phibun government is also trying to create an atmosphere of tension in order to implement the U.S.'s adventurous plan. Recently, just as the U.S. and French invaders have suffered serious defeats in the Indochina War, and the world is calling for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, the Phibun government has announced that 12 provinces on the border between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia are "under martial law," and has increased the deployment of troops and police to the border provinces. The Thai government has also announced the postponement of the demobilization of active-duty soldiers and will carry out "mobilization" "when necessary"; it is even preparing to establish a so-called "Aid to Neighboring Countries Committee" to carry out a so-called Thai-Lao "joint border security plan." Not long ago, the Thai authorities also decided to send dozens of army officers to Laos to reside in various "strategic strongholds" to "study the war situation in Laos." According to the Bangkok "Honorary News," the Thai authorities have "surveyed" the geographical situation of the northeastern border and have decided to force 100,000 young people in the border provinces to be incorporated into the "Volunteer Defense Force." Starting on March 23rd, Thai troops have also been conducting provocative "exercises" for a week on the "river bank across the Mekong River from Laos." Needless to say, these actions of the Phibun government are being carried out purposefully under the direction of the U.S.

Now, Thailand's fate, handed over to others, is awaiting the final confirmation of Washington's overall plan to expand its interference in the Indochina War. The notorious adventurer and ambitious man, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Donovan, has been summoned back to Washington, and before leaving, he openly instructed the Phibun government to "be prepared" "in case of ... involvement in the war." At the same time, U.S. news agencies are also boasting that Donovan's return to the country "has considerable political significance." The United Press said: "General Donovan is returning to the United States to participate in important talks on the Geneva Conference and Southeast Asian defense issues."

In fact, Donovan's return to the U.S. is so valued and linked to Washington's secret collusion on "Southeast Asian defense issues" because Donovan's task is not only to use Thailand to expand interference in the Indochina War, but also to implement the U.S.'s conspiracy to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. On February 17th, the United Press revealed that the U.S. wants to "organize a solid Buddhist state defense group including Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia with the full support of the United States." Now, the United Press is saying again that Donovan is drafting "a plan for certain Southeast Asian countries to conclude a joint security treaty," "this plan will include Thailand and the Indochinese Federal member states (puppets) - Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos - and possibly the Philippines."

This thoroughly exposes that the U.S. is using the Indochina War to gradually control Southeast Asia and thus expand the war. This conspiracy will not only attempt to seize France's position in Indochina, but also to squeeze out the influence of other countries in Southeast Asia. If we link this to the U.S.'s active efforts to conclude a U.S.-Pakistan military agreement and piece together a Middle East aggression group, we will more clearly understand the U.S.'s arrogant ambition to dominate Asia for a long time.

There is no doubt that the U.S.'s conspiracy in Southeast Asia is a vicious step by the U.S. to strengthen the suppression of the people of Southeast Asian countries in their movements to defend peace and strive for national independence. For those countries that are striving to avoid being involved in the danger of war, this cannot but be a serious threat.

Thailand provides a powerful example to some countries, illustrating what the consequences of accepting U.S. aid and succumbing to U.S. policy will be. The movement of the people of Southeast Asian countries against the U.S.-Pakistan military agreement and against U.S. interference in the Indochina War is rising. Any arbitrary policy that disregards the wishes of the people and attempts to force countries onto the road to war is bound to go bankrupt sooner or later.

    美国利用泰国干涉印度支那战争的阴谋
    冯之丹
    美国正在策划扩大干涉印度支那战争，除了企图迫使法国继续以鲜血换取美元，接受由美国“接管”训练印度支那傀儡军队以外，并积极图谋驱使接受美援的亚洲国家为美国火中取栗。美国“华尔街日报”就毫不掩饰地透露美国想要像在朝鲜那样，在印度支那战争中盗用联合国的旗帜，驱使联合国的亚洲会员国提供炮灰。
    近来美国加紧利用泰国来扩大印度支那战争的阴谋活动，就是美国这种罪恶计划的一部分。
    由于銮披汶政府采取了违反泰国安全与民族利益的反动政策，泰国成了美国积极在东南亚扩张势力和执行侵略亚洲计划的一个工具。美国通过对銮披汶政府的所谓“援助”，一步紧一步地控制着泰国的政治经济与军事力量，把泰国变为侵略东南亚的一个军事基地。最近随着美国扩大对印度支那战争的干涉，泰国也被打算放在这种冒险的赌注中了。二月二十日美国“商业周刊”公开说：“美国正试图支持印度支那周围的地区来作为美国对于战场现场的援助的一种补充。泰国在这个战略中占着关键性的地位。”
    早在一九五三年八月美国政府任命特务头子杜诺万为驻泰大使，“炮兵和伞兵专家”吉尔摩为驻泰美国“军事顾问团”团长，就包藏着美国在泰国的阴谋计划。当时合众社曾透露，杜诺万的任务就是要“保证”美、泰两国在美国镇压印度支那民族解放运动的步骤中，取得“更密切的配合”。
    与此同时，美国加紧了对泰国的军事“援助”。据曼谷报纸透露，三年多以来，美国对泰国的军火“援助”已超过一亿美元。今年一月，杜诺万从华盛顿赶回曼谷时，又带了美国援助下进一步增加泰国军队的具体计划。美国驻泰“军事训练团”的成员也已扩充至三百余人。銮披汶政权也就准备强迫所有十八岁到五十五岁的男子都受军事训练。泰国政府的高级人士并承认，銮披汶政权表示愿意为美国扩充泰国的炮灰到二十万人。二月十三日合众社称，美国正考虑以五千万美元“援助”泰国，而“这笔钱至少可以增加训练二个师与补助部队”。
    美国还指使銮披汶政府加紧修建和扩充泰国的海、空军基地。目前已扩建或正在扩建中的机场将近三十处。銮披汶并已着手准备改建位于清迈、帕府等地的十三个飞机场，使之适合美国高速式巨型飞机使用。在尖竹汶府的所谓“战略海岸线”还正在计划建筑一个新的海军基地。銮披汶曾说过：在美国“需要”的时候，“泰方允将各军事基地交由美方使用”。现在，泰国政府正在加紧修筑通往寮国边境的战略公路。美国并指使泰国和高棉傀儡政权着手把曼谷和高棉之间“具有军事价值”的铁路连接起来。
    这样，美国和銮披汶政府在泰国加紧进行这些军事步骤的目的，就表现得非常明显了。
    泰国銮披汶政府居然学着美国冒险家的说谎嘴舌，无中生有地叫嚷所谓“共产党扩张”之类的鬼话，来企图蒙骗泰国人民，掩盖泰国被美国拖到干涉印度支那战争的危险边缘的事实。
    不仅这样，銮披汶政府还竭力制造紧张空气，以便执行美国的冒险计划。最近，正当美、法侵略者在印度支那战争中遭到严重失败，举世要求和平解决印度支那问题之际，銮披汶政府竟宣布了泰国与寮国、高棉接壤的边界上十二个省“进入戒严状态”，增调军警至边界各省。泰国政府并已宣布延缓现役士兵的复员，“在必要时”进行“动员”；甚至准备成立所谓“援助邻邦委员会”，进行所谓泰寮“边区治安联合计划”。不久以前，泰国当局还决定派遣数十名陆军军官去寮国，驻在各个“战略据点”，以“研究寮国的战争形势”。据曼谷“荣誉报”透露，泰国当局已“勘察”东北边境的地理形势，并已决定了在边境省份强迫十万青年编入“志愿保卫队”。三月二十三日起泰国部队更在“隔着湄公河和寮国相望的河岸”进行一星期挑衅性的“演习”。不消说，銮披汶政府的这些举动完全是在美国的导演之下有目的地进行的。
    现在，泰国交到别人手里的命运，只待华盛顿扩大干涉印度支那战争的整个计划的最后确定了。臭名远扬的冒险家和野心家——美国驻泰大使杜诺万，已奉召返华盛顿，行前公然嘱咐銮披汶政府“作好准备”，“以备万一……卷入战争。”同时，美国通讯社也在吹嘘杜诺万的返国，“具有相当重要的政治意义”。合众社说：“杜诺万将军返回美国，是为了参加日内瓦会议问题与东南亚防务问题的重要会谈”。
    事实上，杜诺万返美所以如此被重视，并与华盛顿进行对“东南亚防务问题”的密谋联系起来，是因为杜诺万担负的任务，不仅仅是要利用泰国来扩大干涉印度支那战争，而且执行着美国在东南亚扩张势力的阴谋计划。二月十七日合众社就透露出美国很想“组织一个在美国全力支持下的包括泰国、寮国和高棉在内的稳固的佛教国家防御集团”。现在合众社又说，杜诺万正在拟订“由某些东南亚国家之间缔结共同安全条约的计划”，“这个计划将包括泰国与印度支那联邦成员国（傀儡）——越南、高棉与寮国——可能还有菲律宾。”
    这就彻底地暴露了美国是在利用印度支那战争来一步一步地控制东南亚，并从而扩大战争。这个阴谋计划将不仅企图夺取法国在印度支那的地位，并且要排挤其他国家在东南亚的势力。如果我们再把美国积极进行的订立美巴军事协定和拼凑中东侵略集团的步骤联系起来看，就会更加清楚地了解到美国企图长期统治亚洲的狂妄野心。
    毫无疑问，美国在东南亚的阴谋计划，是美国加强镇压东南亚各国人民保卫和平争取民族独立运动的凶恶步骤。对于那些力求使自己不被卷入战争危险的国家来说，这也不能不是严重的威胁。
    泰国给一些国家提供了一个有力的例证，说明了接受美援及屈从美国的政策，将会使自己造成怎样的一种后果。东南亚各国人民反对美巴军事协定、反对美国干涉印度支那战争的运动，正在日益高涨起来。任何不顾人民的愿望而企图迫使各国走向战争道路的专横政策，迟早总是要破产的。
