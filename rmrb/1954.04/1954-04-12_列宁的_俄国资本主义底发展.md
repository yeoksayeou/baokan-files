Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia," a work of brilliant scientific genius, was written between 1896 and 1899 while Lenin was imprisoned and exiled. It was published on April 12, 1899, exactly fifty-five years ago today.

Like Marx and Engels, Lenin was a great revolutionary and theorist. His theoretical activities stemmed from the demands of revolutionary practice; and the results of his theoretical activities served as a guide for revolutionary practice. Lenin wrote "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" in order to complete the task of ideologically crushing populism, thereby laying the theoretical foundation for the determination of the revolutionary tactics of the proletariat party.

The populist view of Russia's economic development was this: due to the self-sufficiency of the Russian economy, the existence of the commune system, and the lack of sales markets, the development of capitalism in Russia was impossible. They believed that the products of capitalist production could not be realized in the domestic market, and the foreign markets had already been completely occupied by developed imperialist countries. Therefore, they asserted that Russian capitalism had no prospects for development.

Obviously, to crush populism, it was first necessary to crush the populists' reactionary view of Russia's economic development, because this view was the theoretical foundation of populism. If it could be proven based on existing facts that Russia's economy was developing, whether within or outside the village communes, and that, despite the remnants of feudalism, it had indeed embarked on the road of capitalism, thus the class composition of Russian society was basically that of a capitalist society, then the entire populist theory and program could be thoroughly broken. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the completion of this critical task would also lay the foundation for the correct formulation of the revolutionary program of the proletariat party.

Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" brilliantly accomplished this great task.

In the first chapter of this work, Lenin succinctly and clearly expounded Marx's theory of capitalist production and reproduction, pointing out that "the basic process of the creation of a domestic market... is the social division of labor," and that "the social division of labor is the foundation of the entire development process of commodity economy and capitalism"; pointing out that "when a commodity economy appears, a domestic market also appears; the domestic market is created by the development of this commodity economy, and the degree of refinement of the social division of labor determines the height of its development"; pointing out that capitalist production is established when direct producers are deprived of the means of production, wealthy industrialists and merchants concentrate the means of production, and direct producers become wage laborers, at this time commodity production develops to a high degree, and the domestic market also develops to a high degree. Therefore, the bankruptcy and proletarianization of small producers precisely demonstrates the expansion of the domestic market, rather than indicating its contraction; pointing out that the development of capitalist production is mainly in the production of the means of production, therefore, although the development of capitalist production is ultimately linked to personal consumption, it does not depend on the increase in personal consumption to a certain extent, therefore, the contradiction between capitalism's tendency to infinitely expand production and the limited consumption of the proletariat working people does not make the development of capitalist production impossible, nor does it negate the progressiveness of the capitalist system compared to the preceding socio-economic system. In short, he pointed out: "The capitalist 'domestic market' is created by the developing capitalism itself, which deepens the social division of labor and divides the direct producers into capitalists and workers. The degree of development of the domestic market is the degree of development of capitalism in that country."

Lenin thus elucidated several basic principles of political economy regarding the issue of the capitalist domestic market, criticizing the populists' error of separating the domestic market issue from the capitalist development issue. Lenin used this chapter as an introduction to the factual parts of the rest of the book. In the following chapters, he used these basic principles to summarize the facts.

In the second, third, and fourth chapters, Lenin profoundly demonstrated the facts of capitalist development in Russian agriculture after the 1861 reform, based on rich factual materials. Lenin pointed out that the differentiation of peasants was proceeding rapidly, and this differentiation was creating a capitalist domestic market; serfdom, usury, and labor service, and other remnants of the feudal system, were hindering this differentiation process. He pointed out that the labor service system was declining, wage labor was developing, agricultural machinery was being adopted, landlords had to turn to capitalist management methods, and the labor service economy was transitioning to a capitalist economy. He pointed out that agriculture was increasingly commercial and entrepreneurial in nature. The development of capitalist agriculture created a domestic market for capitalism, created large-scale agricultural production based on the use of machines and extensive worker cooperation, destroyed labor service and the personal dependence of peasants, and created the mobility of the agricultural population, which "replaced their small, medieval divisions with a large, nationwide class division of farmers," which developed their consciousness and autonomy. Large agricultural production was socialized, but with the development of this socialization, agriculture was bound to be involved in the crisis of capitalist overproduction, and this crisis gave a strong impetus to the development of agricultural socialization.

After the above three specific analyses, Lenin drew a conclusion on the "commune" based on Marx's view of small agriculture. "The principle of the commune hinders the capture of agricultural production by capital" – this was the populists' "theory." Lenin pointed out: "No land ownership can constitute an insurmountable obstacle to capitalism, which takes various forms according to various agricultural, legal, and living conditions." The commune could never prevent the differentiation of small farmers. Capitalism had developed in the commune. "Regardless of people's formulating and overturning all plans, capitalism is following its own path, and the commune village is becoming a village of small farmers." The "commune," along with its joint responsibility, heavy taxes on peasants, lack of freedom of movement, etc., were all remnants of serfdom in Russia at that time. "All these ancient systems cannot guarantee the non-differentiation of peasants at all, but only lead to an increase in various forms of labor service and serfdom, leading to a huge obstacle to the entire social development." Therefore, what was beneficial to workers and peasants was the disintegration of the commune, not its preservation. Therefore, when the commune was shaken by the development of capitalist agriculture, Marxists were looking at the future of true socialism, while the populists were eulogizing the stagnation of the medieval serf system.

In the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters, Lenin still used rich factual materials as a basis to specifically discuss the process of capitalist development in Russian industry.

Lenin pointed out that there were three main stages in the development of capitalism in Russian industry: small commodity production – capitalist manufactory – factory. The facts analyzed by Lenin refuted the populists' views. According to the populists' views, small commodity production seemed to be detached from capitalist relations. But the real economic situation had nothing in common with this. "Home handicraft" industry and "factory" industry were not isolated. "The basic trend of small commodity production lies in the development of capitalism, especially in the formation of manufactories, and manufactories, in our eyes, are growing into large-scale machine industry extremely rapidly." Russian large industry was developing. And the development of large industry created a huge and increasingly expanding market for the means of production, thereby developing the market for personal consumer goods, which further expanded the domestic market. "Russia with wooden plows and threshing sticks, water mills and hand looms, is beginning to rapidly become Russia with iron plows and threshing machines, steam mills and steam looms." This was the fact before their eyes, no matter what the populists' desire to "avoid capitalism" was! According to the populists' views, the proletariat would not develop in Russia, and the proletariat was not the main revolutionary force. But this was also extremely absurd. Due to the development of capitalism in Russia, the proletariat was also growing. From 1865 to 1890, "the number of workers in capitalist large enterprises increased more than twofold in twenty-five years." They are the most revolutionary class in history.

In the last chapter of this work, Lenin summarized the statistical materials examined in the previous chapters, focusing on the issue of the domestic market formation process. Lenin demonstrated that the increase in commodity circulation, the increase in the industrial and commercial population, the increase in factory and industrial and commercial small cities and villages, the increase in population inflow into cities, the increase in the use of wage labor, the formation of the domestic labor market, and other facts proved that "the establishment of the capitalist domestic market is due to the parallel development of capitalism in agriculture and industry, is due to the formation of a class of rural entrepreneurs and industrial entrepreneurs on the one hand, and the formation of a class of agricultural wage laborers and industrial wage laborers on the other hand." This proves the consistency between Marxist economic theory and Russian economic facts.

Finally, Lenin demonstrated the significance of foreign markets. He pointed out that capitalism must have foreign markets, but not because the domestic market cannot realize its products, but because capitalism cannot produce on an unchanging scale, it has an unlimited tendency to expand. Coupled with the inherent uneven development of capitalism, the rapidly developing sectors cannot wait for the expansion of the existing market, but demand the development of new markets. "Therefore, the process of capitalist market formation manifests itself in two aspects, namely: the development of capitalism in depth, that is, the further development of capitalist agriculture and capitalist industry within the existing, certain, and isolated territories; the development of capitalism in breadth, that is, the extension of the scope of capitalist rule to new territories." This was precisely the situation of capitalist development in Russia at that time, which was expanding from the mainland to the border areas.

After summarizing the development of capitalism in Russia, Lenin said: Acknowledging the progressiveness of capitalism is consistent with acknowledging the negative and dark aspects of capitalism.

"The progressive historical role of capitalism can be summarized in two short propositions, namely: the increase in the social productivity of labor and its socialization." Capitalism destroyed the decentralization of the natural economy and converged small local markets into national markets and even world markets; capitalism replaced the decentralization of production with the concentration of production in agriculture and industry; capitalism swept away the personal dependence generated by the previous economic system; capitalism created the mobility of the population; capitalism constantly reduced the proportion of the agricultural population and increased large industrial centers; capitalism destroyed the narrow, local, and hierarchical associations of medieval society and promoted the union of huge social classes; capitalism, through the above-mentioned changes in the old economic structure, caused changes in the mental outlook of people: all of this greatly increased the socialization of production and developed social productive forces. Naturally, the development of capitalism is not balanced or symmetrical. Periods of prosperity are replaced by periods of panic, wealth accumulation and poverty accumulation run in parallel, social production and private ownership form a sharp opposition, its progress and its contradictions all illustrate its historical transitional nature. The historical "mission" of capitalism lies in creating conditions under the capitalist mode of production to prepare for a more advanced society—socialist society.

Russia was already a capitalist country at that time. However, "no capitalist country has so many ancient systems remaining, these ancient systems are incompatible with capitalism, hinder the development of capitalism, and make the production situation deteriorate without limit, and the producers 'suffer not only from capitalism, but also from the insufficiency of capitalism'." What were these ancient systems? These were the "rural communes," "national production," and the remnants of the feudal system closely related to them, which were eulogized by the populists.

On the one hand, capitalism had already developed, and on the other hand, feudal remnants were still deeply rooted. This was the economic foundation of Russia at that time.

Lenin said in the preface to the second edition of this book: "On this economic basis, the Russian revolution is inevitably a bourgeois revolution."

The populists denied the development of capitalism in Russia and denied the historical role of the proletariat. Despite waving the banner of "socialism," they were in fact bourgeois liberals, representatives of wealthy farmers, and supported the alliance of landlords and the bourgeoisie. Plekhanov, in his anti-populist works, admitted the development of capitalism in Russia and admitted the bourgeois nature of the Russian revolution, but he came to the erroneous conclusion that the bourgeoisie has a leading role in the revolution and that socialists must support liberals. In this way, he abandoned the leading role of the proletariat.

Based on profound economic analysis, Lenin insightfully perceived the leading role of the proletariat, insightfully perceived the dual status and dual role of the peasantry—"the opposition between its internal possessive tendencies and proletarian tendencies," and insightfully perceived the weakness and compromise of the Russian bourgeoisie, clearly pointing out: "On the current economic basis of the Russian revolution, there can objectively be two basic development routes and endings for the Russian revolution. ... Either the main part of landlord land ownership and the main basis of the old 'superstructure' are preserved; hence, the overwhelming role of liberal monarchist bourgeois and landlords, the rapid turn of wealthy farmers to their side, and the decline in the status of the peasant masses.... Or the main part of landlord land ownership and all the main foundations of the related old 'superstructure' are destroyed; the proletariat and the peasant masses have an overwhelming role to neutralize the wavering or counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie; ... hence, the most favorable conditions are created for the working class to further realize its true and fundamental socialist reform tasks." In simple terms, there were two paths: one was the reformist path of compromise between the bourgeoisie and the landlord class, and the other was the path of the worker-peasant alliance carrying out a thorough democratic revolution and then transitioning to a socialist revolution.

Lenin's genius foresight has been confirmed by the successive Russian revolutions. Relying on the worker-peasant alliance, the Russian proletariat has gone through a victorious socialist revolution and socialist construction and embarked on the road to communism.

Lenin's brilliant work has great significance for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, whether in the past or present.

China also had its own "populist" thought, "dreaming that China could 'prevent' capitalism, dreaming that China could carry out 'social revolution' more easily because of its backwardness." (Lenin: "Democracy and Populism in China") Lenin's theory tells us that this is not "preventing" capitalism, but abolishing socialism. The Chinese Trotskyite bandits insisted that Chinese society was already a capitalist society, and therefore said that the Chinese revolution should start from the socialist revolution. Lenin's theory dealt a devastating blow to this "one-time revolution theory." Lenin recognized that Russia was a capitalist country, but feudal remnants still existed, and therefore recognized that the first stage of the Russian revolution was a bourgeois revolution. Then, how could China, with a lower level of capitalist development, stronger feudal remnants, and the addition of imperialist rule, not start from the national democratic revolution but from the socialist revolution! The Trotskyite bandits used their "socialist revolution" to abolish the national democratic revolution. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy": "'One-time revolution theorists' do not want revolution, which is the essence of the problem."

Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people have already achieved victory in the national democratic revolution. Now, the Chinese revolution has entered the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. Of course, our current environment is different from that of Russia at the end of the 19th century. But the various economic forms analyzed by Lenin, as well as the laws of development of these economic forms in interaction, are still vivid facts before our eyes. Therefore, seriously studying "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and understanding its essence will provide us with profound theoretical guidance when we are struggling to realize the Party's general line during the transition period.

Lenin's brilliant work, like Marx's "Capital," is the highest model of scientific works. It is a model of the spirit of investigation and research, a model of the connection between theory and practice, and a brilliant monument in the development of Marxist economics. This work has been tested for almost half a century, and history has proven that it is an inexhaustible source of thought and wisdom.

    列宁的“俄国资本主义底发展”
    孙叔平
    “俄国资本主义底发展”这部天才的科学著作，是一八九六——一八九九年列宁在监禁和流放的条件下写成的。出版时间是一八九九年四月十二日，到今天，恰好满五十五周年。
    与马克思、恩格斯一样，列宁是伟大的革命家和理论家。他的理论活动是革命实践的要求；而他的理论活动的结果又是革命实践的指南。列宁所以要写“俄国资本主义底发展”，是为了完成从思想上粉碎民粹主义的事业，从而为无产阶级政党的革命策略的规定打下理论基础。
    民粹派对俄国经济发展的观点是这样的：由于俄国经济的自给自足、公社制度的存在和缺乏销售市场，俄国资本主义的发展是没有可能的。他们认为，资本主义生产的产品是不能在国内市场上实现的，而国外市场早已全被发达的帝国主义国家所占据，因此，他们断言，俄国资本主义不可能有其发展的前途。
    很显然，要粉碎民粹主义，就首先要粉碎民粹派对俄国经济发展的反动观点，因为这种观点是民粹主义的理论基础。假如能够根据当前存在事实证明俄国经济的发展，无论在村社内或在村社外，虽然还存在着封建制度的残余，但已经确实地走上资本主义的道路，从而俄国社会的阶级构成已经基本上是资本主义社会的阶级构成，则整个民粹派的理论与纲领就可以彻底攻破。这是一方面。另一方面，这个批判任务的完成也就为无产阶级政党的革命纲领的正确规定打下了基础。
    列宁的“俄国资本主义底发展”一书，光辉地完成了这个伟大的任务。
          ×　×　×
    列宁在这部著作的第一章中，简洁明快地阐述了马克思关于资本主义生产和再生产的理论，指明：“国内市场底创立……之基本过程是社会分工”，“社会分工是商品经济与资本主义全部发展过程底基础”；指明：“当商品经济出现的时候，国内市场也就出现；国内市场是由这种商品经济底发展所创立，社会分工之精细程度决定着它的发展底高度”；指明：在直接生产者被剥夺了生产资料，富有的工商业者集中了生产资料，而直接生产者变成了雇佣劳动者的时候，资本主义生产就成立了，这时商品生产就发展到高度，国内市场也就发展到高度。因此，小生产者的破产和无产阶级化正是表现国内市场的扩展，而不是表示国内市场的减缩；指明：资本主义生产的发展主要是在生产资料的生产方面，因此，资本主义生产的发展虽然归根结底是和个人的消费联系着，但在某种程度上并不依存于个人消费的增长，因此，资本主义无限扩大生产的倾向与无产阶级劳动人民有限的消费之间的矛盾，并不使资本主义生产发展成为不可能，也不抵消资本主义制度较之先行的社会经济制的进步性。总之，他指明：“资本主义的‘国内市场’，是由发展着的资本主义自身所创立，资本主义加深着社会分工，把直接生产者分为资本家和工人。国内市场发展底程度，就是该国资本主义发展底程度。”
    列宁就是这样地阐明了政治经济学关于资本主义国内市场问题的几个基本原理，批判了民粹派把国内市场问题和资本主义发展问题割裂开来的错误。列宁把这一章作为本书其余事实部分的导言。在以后各章中就运用这些基本原理来总结事实。
    在第二、三、四章中，列宁以丰富的事实材料为基础，深刻地论证了一八六一年改革以后俄国农业中资本主义发展的事实。列宁指出，农民的分化正在迅速进行，这种分化创立着资本主义的国内市场；奴役、高利贷和工役制等等封建制的残余则阻碍着这个分化过程。指出，工役制度衰落了，雇佣劳动发展了，农业机器也被采用了，地主不得不转而采用资本主义的经营方式，工役经济就过渡到资本主义经济。指出，农业一天比一天更多地带有着商业的、企业的性质。资本主义农业的发展，给资本主义造成了国内市场，创造了以使用机器及工人广泛合作为基础的大规模农业生产，摧毁了工役制与农民的人格依附，造成了农业人口的流动性，这就“以农人底大的包括全国的阶级的划分来代替了他们的小的中世纪的划分”，就发展了他们的觉悟性与自动性。大农业生产是社会化了，但随着这种社会化的发展，农业也就必然卷入资本主义生产过剩的危机，而这种危机又给农业社会化发展以强有力的推动。
    经过以上三方面的具体分析，列宁就根据马克思对小农业的观点对“公社”作了一个结论。“公社的原理阻碍着资本之夺取农业生产”——这是民粹派的“理论”。列宁指出：“没有任何土地所有权能够构成资本主义不可克服的障碍，资本主义按照各种不同的农业的、法律的与生活的条件而采取各种不同的形式。”公社决不能阻止小农的分化。资本主义已在公社中发展起来了。“不管人们制定和推翻一切计划，资本主义却走着自己的道路，而且公社的乡村变成小农业家底乡村。”“公社”连同着它的连环保、对农民的重税、没有迁移自由等等，在当时的俄国，都是农奴制的残余。“这一切古旧的制度丝毫不能保证农民不分化，只是导引到各种工役形式与奴役形式底增多，导引到整个社会发展底巨大阻碍。”因此，对工农有利的是公社的瓦解，而不是公社的保存。因此，在公社为资本主义农业的发展所动摇的时候，马克思主义者的眼睛是望着真正的社会主义的未来，而民粹派则歌颂着中古奴役制度的停滞。
    在第五、六、七章中，列宁仍以丰富的事实材料为基础，特别地论述了俄国工业中资本主义发展的过程。
    列宁指出，俄国工业中资本主义的发展有三个主要阶段：小商品生产——资本主义工场手工业——工厂。为列宁所分析的事实驳倒了民粹派的见解。依据民粹派的见解，小商品生产似乎是脱离了资本主义关系的。但真实的经济情形与此毫无共同之点。“家庭手工”工业与“工厂”工业并不是隔绝的。“小商品生产底基本趋势是在于资本主义底发展，特别是在于工场手工业底形成，而工场手工业在我们眼中是极其迅速地成长为大机器工业。”俄国大工业是在发展着。而大工业的发展又创造了巨大的并且日益扩展的生产资料市场，从而也就发展了个人消费品市场，这就更进一步地扩张了国内市场。“木犁与打谷棒、水磨与手织机的俄国，开始迅速地变为铁犁与打谷机、蒸汽磨与蒸汽织机的俄国。”这是眼前的事实，不管民粹派有怎样的“避免资本主义”的愿望！依据民粹派的见解，在俄国，无产阶级不会发展起来，无产阶级并不是主要的革命力量。但这也是极其悖谬的。由于资本主义在俄国的发展，无产阶级也日益增长起来。从一八六五年到一八九○年，“资本主义大企业中的工人数目在二十五年中增加到两倍以上”。他们是历史上最革命的阶级。
    在这部著作的最后一章中，列宁总结了前几章考察过的统计材料，着重地说明了关于国内市场形成过程的问题。列宁论证了商品流通的增长、工商业人口的增长、工厂的和工商业的小城市与村落的增长、人口流入城市的增长、雇佣劳动使用的增长、国内劳动力市场的形成等等事实，证明“资本主义国内市场之建立，是由于农业中与工业中资本主义底平行的发展，是由于一方面农村企业家与工业企业家阶级底形成，另方面农业雇佣工人与工业雇佣工人阶级底形成。”证明马克思主义经济理论与俄国经济事实的一致。
    最后，列宁论证了国外市场的意义。他指出：资本主义必须有国外市场，但不是由于国内市场不能实现生产品，而是由于资本主义不能以不变的规模进行生产，它有无限扩张的倾向。加上资本主义所固有的发展不平衡，更使猛烈发展中的部门不能等待旧有市场的扩大，而要求发展新市场。“因此，资本主义市场形成底过程表现着两方面，即是：资本主义之在深度上的发展，即现有的、一定的与闭关自守的领土内资本主义农业与资本主义工业之进一步的发展；资本主义之在广度上的发展，即资本主义统治范围之推广到新的领土内。”这也正是当时俄国资本主义发展的形势，它正在由本土扩展向边疆。
    列宁在总结了俄国资本主义的发展以后，说道：承认资本主义的进步性和承认资本主义的消极和黑暗方面是一致的。
    “资本主义底进步的历史作用，可以用两个简短的命题概括起来，这两个命题就是：社会劳动生产力底提高及其社会化。”资本主义破坏了自然经济的分散性，把小的地方市场汇合成为国家市场以至世界市场；资本主义在农业和工业中以生产集中代替了生产的分散；资本主义扫除了由以前经济制度产生的人格依存；资本主义造成了人口的流动性；资本主义经常减少农业人口的比例，增加了大工业中心；资本主义破坏了中世纪社会的狭隘的、地方的等级联合，推动着巨大的社会阶级的联合；资本主义通过上述旧经济结构的改变引起了人的精神面貌的改变：所有这一切都大大提高了生产的社会化，发展了社会生产力。自然，资本主义的发展并不是平衡的、匀称的。繁荣时期为恐慌时期所代替，财富积累与贫困积累相并行，社会性生产与私人占有形成尖锐的对立，它的进步和它的矛盾都说明它的历史过渡性质。资本主义的历史“使命”就在于在资本主义生产方式下创造条件，为更高级的社会——社会主义社会作准备。
    俄国在当时已经是一个资本主义国家了。但是，“没有一个资本主义国家内残存着这样繁多的古旧制度，这些古旧制度是与资本主义不相容的，是阻碍资本主义发展的，是使生产状况无限制地恶化的，而生产者‘不仅苦于资本主义，并且苦于资本主义底不足’”。这些古旧制度是什么呢？这些就是民粹派所歌颂咏叹的“农村公社”“国民生产”以及和它们密切相联的封建制度的残余。
    一方面，资本主义已经发展了，另一方面，封建残余又依然根深柢固。这就是当时俄国的经济基础。
    列宁在本书第二版序言中说道：“在这个经济基础上，俄国革命不可避免地是资产阶级性的革命。”
    民粹派否认俄国资本主义的发展，否认无产阶级的历史作用，尽管打着“社会主义”的幌子，事实上却是资产阶级自由派，作富农的代表，拥护着地主资产阶级的联盟。普列汉诺夫在其反民粹派的著作中，承认俄国资本主义的发展，承认俄国革命的资产阶级性质，但他却得出错误的结论说：资产阶级在革命中具有领导作用，社会主义者必须拥护自由派。这样他就放弃了无产阶级的领导作用。
    列宁根据深刻的经济分析，洞察无产阶级的领导作用，洞察农民的双重地位与双重作用——“它内部的所有主倾向与无产者倾向之对立”，洞察了俄国资产阶级的软弱性与妥协性，明确地指出：“在当前俄国革命经济基础上，俄国革命客观上可能有两种基本的发展路线和结局。……或者是地主土地占有制之主要部分与旧的‘上层建筑’之主要基础保存下来；由此就有自由君主派资产者与地主之压倒的作用，富农之迅速转向他们方面，农民群众之地位降落……。或者是地主土地占有制与有关的旧的‘上层建筑’底一切主要基础被破坏了；无产阶级与农民群众具有压倒的作用而使动摇的或反革命的资产阶级中立起来；……由此就造成工人阶级进一步实现其真正和根本的社会主义改革任务之最有利的条件。”简单地说，就是：一条是资产阶级与地主阶级妥协的改良主义道路，一条是工农联盟进行彻底的民主革命然后转变到社会主义革命的道路。
    列宁的天才预见，已为俄国历次革命所证实。俄国无产阶级依靠着工农联盟，已经经过胜利的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，走上了通向共产主义的道路。

    列宁这部天才的著作，对于中国工人阶级和中国人民，不论在过去或现在，都有重大的意义。
    中国也曾有过自己的“民粹主义”思想，“梦想在中国可以‘预防’资本主义，梦想在中国可以因其落后而比较易于进行‘社会革命’”。（列宁：“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”）列宁的理论指示我们，这并不是“预防”资本主义，而是取消社会主义。中国的托洛茨基匪徒则硬说中国社会已经是资本主义社会了，因而说中国革命就应当从社会主义革命做起。列宁的理论更给这种“一次革命论”以毁灭性的打击。列宁认定俄国是资本主义国家，但封建残余仍然存在，因而认定俄国革命的第一阶段是资产阶级性的革命。那么，资本主义发展更低、封建残余更强、又加上帝国主义统治的中国，怎样能够不从民族民主革命而从社会主义革命做起呢！托洛茨基匪徒是用他们的“社会主义革命”来取消民族民主革命。因此，毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中指出：“‘一次革命论’者，不要革命论也，这就是问题的本质。”
    中国人民在马克思列宁主义的引导下，已经取得民族民主革命的胜利。现在，中国革命已经进入了社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段。我国当前所处的环境和十九世纪末叶的俄国当然不同。但列宁所分析的各种经济形态，以及各种经济形态在交互作用下发展的规律，还是摆在我们眼前的活生生的事实。因此，认真地学习“俄国资本主义底发展”，领会其精神实质，在我们为实现党在过渡时期总路线而斗争时，将会得到深刻的理论指示。
    列宁这部天才的著作，与马克思的“资本论”一样，是科学著作的最高典范。它是调查研究精神的典范，是理论与实际联系的典范，是马克思主义经济学发展中的一块光辉的纪念碑。这部著作已经经过了差不多半个世纪的考验，历史证明了它是取之不尽的思想与智慧的源泉。
