Fujian Province Credit Cooperative Organizations Have New Developments
Actively Organizing Rural Idle Funds to Vigorously Support Spring Planting Production

Since the beginning of spring, rural credit cooperative organizations in various parts of Fujian Province have seen new developments. According to incomplete statistics from the Fujian Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China as of the end of March, the province already has 859 credit cooperatives and 2,683 credit mutual aid groups, with more than 470,000 farmers participating in credit cooperative organizations. On average, there is one credit cooperative organization in less than two townships in the province's 6,568 townships.

During the spring plowing season, these credit cooperative organizations actively expanded their work of absorbing rural idle funds and issuing loans to support agricultural production. At present, credit cooperative organizations throughout the province have collected approximately 10 billion yuan in share capital and absorbed rural idle funds. The Wushan Township Credit Cooperative in Minhou County has existing funds of more than 200 million yuan. It can not only issue this year's spring plowing loans on its own instead of the state bank, but also has surplus funds deposited in the bank to support the spring plowing production of farmers in other townships through the state bank. The Yanshan Township Credit Cooperative in Jinjiang County had insufficient funds and signed a business contract with the local bank, distributing 42.38 million yuan in fertilizer and cattle loans on behalf of the bank. At the same time, it also issued 3.14 million yuan in small loans, helping farmers purchase 900 jin of grain seeds, 12 new waterwheels, and other small farm tools. The business activities of credit cooperative organizations in various places have effectively cracked down on usurers. After the establishment of the Xiadong Credit Cooperative in Hui'an County, usury activities were severely suppressed. One usurer had to reduce the interest rate on private loans from 20% to 2%.

The vigorous support of spring plowing production by credit cooperative organizations in various places has further encouraged farmers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Shajing Township Credit Cooperative in Changle County originally had 285 members, but has recently increased to more than 500. After the Yanshan Township Credit Cooperative in Jinjiang County issued spring plowing production loans, another sixteen farmers deposited 13.6 million yuan of idle funds into the credit cooperative.

    福建省信用合作组织有新发展
    现正组织农村游资大力支持春耕生产
    福建省各地农村信用合作组织入春以来有了新的发展。据中国人民银行福建省分行截至三月底的不完全统计，全省已有八百五十九个信用合作社、二千六百八十三个信用互助组，参加信用合作组织的农民有四十七万多人。全省六千五百六十八个乡镇，平均不到两个乡镇就有一个信用合作组织。
    这些信用合作组织在春耕期间，积极展开吸收农村游资，发放贷款，支持农业生产的工作。目前全省信用合作组织已经收集股金和吸收农村游资约达一百亿元。闽侯县吴山乡信用合作社现有资金两亿余元，不但可以代替国家银行自行发放今年春耕贷款，而且还有剩余资金存入银行，通过国家银行支援外乡农民的春耕生产。晋江县雁山乡信用合作社现有资金不足，和当地银行订立业务合同，代银行发放了肥料、耕牛贷款四千二百三十八万元，同时自己也发放了小额贷款三百一十四万元，帮助农民购买了九百斤谷种、十二架新水车和其他小农具。各地信用合作组织的业务活动，有力地打击了高利贷者。惠安县霞东信用合作社成立后，高利贷活动受到严重打击，有个高利贷者不得不把私人借贷的利息从二十分降为二分。
    各地信用合作组织大力扶助春耕生产进一步鼓舞了农民参加互助合作运动的积极性。长乐县沙京乡信用合作社原有社员二百八十五人，最近已增至五百多人。晋江县雁山乡信用合作社发放春耕生产贷款以后，又有十六户农民把闲散资金一千三百六十万元存入信用合作社。
