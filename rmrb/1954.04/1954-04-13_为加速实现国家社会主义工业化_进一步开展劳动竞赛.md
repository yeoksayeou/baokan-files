To Accelerate the Realization of National Socialist Industrialization
    Further Launch Labor Emulation Drives

    [This newspaper dispatch] To greet the 1954 "May Day" International Labor Day, labor emulation drives are unfolding in many industrial and transportation units, as well as at basic construction sites.

  Workers of Units such as the Shenyang Smelting Plant
    Promote the Spirit of Innovation to Launch Emulation Drives
    Workers of units such as the Shenyang Smelting Plant are using practical actions of deeply developing socialist labor emulation drives to greet "May Day" International Labor Day. After comprehensively overfulfilling the first quarter's production plan, the Shenyang Smelting Plant, starting in April, launched a labor emulation drive centered on technological innovation to greet "May Day" International Labor Day. In order to promote the competition and make the goals of the competition clearer, the leadership of the Shenyang Smelting Plant put forward ten key production issues for the entire factory's workers; the trade union also widely publicized the innovative spirit of production innovators.  Less than a few days after the start of the competition, Wang Zi'an, a mechanic from the repair team of the zinc electrolysis workshop, and Feng Junshan, the leader of the fitter team, solved the key problem of automatic feeding in the rotary kiln section, which greatly reduced the intensity of workers' physical labor and saved one feeding worker; the key problem of increasing the output of danfan by adding neutralization tanks in the danfan section of the copper electrolysis workshop was also solved under the close cooperation of section chief Wang Mao Yan and veteran worker Li Changchun, learning from advanced Soviet experience, which increased the output of danfan by nearly one time; the technical innovation of automatic ore-pulling trucks in the power department has also been successfully test-driven and the effect is very good; now, workers in other workshops are also working hard to realize their own technical innovation actions in the competition.  On April 6, the state-owned Fourth Rubber Factory held a mobilization meeting for all employees to welcome "May Day" and further develop the socialist labor emulation drive, mobilizing all employees to further promote the spirit of production technology innovation, solve key problems, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the plan. In addition, in the local state-owned industry of Shenyang City, enamel factories, refractory material factories, shoe factories, metal products factories, electrical equipment factories and other units have also launched labor emulation drives to welcome "May Day."

    The entire crew of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration is enthusiastically carrying out a full-load, over-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement to greet "May Day" International Labor Day, guaranteeing the completion and overfulfillment of this year's heavy transportation tasks. The Transportation Workshop Branch of the CCP Sujiatun Locomotive Depot deployed publicity and mobilization work, calling on all crew members to completely eliminate accidents in April, implement various advanced experiences, ensure punctual operation, and strive to pull 1,700 over-axle and 380,000 tons to greet "May Day" International Labor Day and strive for the Harbin Railway Administration's winning circular red flag.  The national railway model group - the Zheng Xikun Youth Chartered Group of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, put forward a practical action to ensure the complete elimination of all accidents, traction exceeding four or five axles, and overweight of 10,000 tons in the full-load, over-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement and punctual operation competition, as a gift to "May Day" International Labor Day.

  Twenty Local State-Owned Factories in Tianjin
    Launch Inter-Factory Increase Production and Practice Economy Emulation

    Workers of twenty local state-owned factories in Tianjin, in order to greet "May Day" International Labor Day, started an inter-factory production increase and economy practice emulation that runs throughout the year, starting from the second quarter. The purpose of this inter-factory production increase and economy practice emulation is to make all factories promote the spirit of collectivism through competition, cooperate, encourage each other, promote each other, help each other, give full play to the initiative and pioneering spirit of the working class, use the advanced to drive the backward, seek common progress and common improvement of all factories on the existing basis, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan and the production increase and economy practice plan.  The Light Industry Management Office of the Tianjin Municipal Local State-Owned Industry Bureau held an expanded cadre meeting of all factories, mobilizing the employees of all factories to enthusiastically participate in the inter-factory production increase and economy practice emulation.  Representatives of the Zhonghua Match Factory challenged all brother factories at the meeting, and representatives of all factories responded enthusiastically.  In the challenge response, all factories formulated specific guarantee conditions. In addition to guaranteeing the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan and the production increase and economy practice plan, they also put forward conditions such as using substitutes, saving raw materials, and manufacturing new products. In order to summarize achievements and exchange experiences in a timely manner, the Local State-Owned Industry Bureau decided to conduct a judgment every three months and reward the top three winning factories in the competition.

  The Famous Liu Lifu and Guo Zhaolan Groups
    Want to Use Surplus Achievements to Offer Gifts to "May Day"

    The nationally renowned Liu Lifu Group of the Lushun Factory proposed an advanced plan to complete two months of production quotas in April as a gift to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. The Liu Lifu Group has been conducting regular labor emulation drives for several years. After completing the 1957 plan in December last year, they proposed a competition plan to learn from Wang Chonglun, to complete the second quarter plan of 1959 by the end of 1954, and guarantee excellent quality and save ten tons of raw materials throughout the year. In the implementation of this plan, they continued to carry forward collective wisdom, and constantly created and improved tire molds, created triangular tire molds, and increased efficiency by one time. At present, they have completed the second quarter plan of 1958 ahead of schedule. In March, the Liu Lifu Group initially discussed the issue of raising the labor emulation to a higher level. After careful discussion on April 3, they formulated a labor emulation plan to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. The plan proposed that in April, they guarantee to complete two months of production quotas, guarantee excellent product quality, and save six hundred kilograms of raw materials. They also put forward specific guarantee measures such as continuing to promote the spirit of innovation, applying advanced experience; strengthening the maintenance and upkeep of equipment to ensure safe production; strengthening political study, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthening mutual assistance and unity. Now, all the workers in the group are confidently implementing this labor emulation plan.

    The Guo Zhaolan Group of the Passenger Car Workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory is continuing to carry out labor emulation, and will use the practical action of overfulfilling the April production plan by 125 percent to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day. The Guo Zhaolan Group was originally a freight car blanking group, and began to be changed to a substitute passenger car blanking group in March. The quality of substitute passenger cars is more precise than the quality of freight cars. In order to adapt to the new situation of producing this product, the Guo Zhaolan Group divided into twelve labor groups according to specialties, and carried out production according to the assembly line operation method, which increased production efficiency by one and a half times, and completed the first quarter production task ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the task. In April, the production task of the Guo Zhaolan Group was changed from an average of more than 30 working hours per vehicle in March to 13 working hours. In order to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day, all the workers in the group proposed to guarantee the overfulfillment of the April production plan by 125 percent, and at the same time, the quality should be increased from the current 80 percent to 97 percent, and 20 artificial jobs should be saved and sent to the timber workshop to help cut materials.

  All Builders on the Hanshui Railway Bridge Construction Site
    Build the No. 5 Pier out of the Water before the Flood Season

    Four of the five most arduous piers of the Hanshui Railway Bridge project have been built out of the water. The No. 5 pier has now also been driven with foundation piles and is being constructed at an accelerated pace. The builders on the construction site enthusiastically responded to the call of the construction site party committee: "Guarantee quality, build the No. 5 pier, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the underwater foundation project," launched a labor emulation drive to welcome "May Day" International Labor Day, and are full of confidence in building the No. 5 pier out of the water before this year's major flood season. On April 8, the first day of the Labor Day competition, all the groups in the water work area overfulfilled the day's plan. The workers of the Liu Jinxiang group not only completed the mooring work ahead of schedule, but also helped the workers of the Bi Yunzhi group to complete part of the task; after the Bi Yunzhi group took over, they completed their own task in three hours, and then helped the Kuang Yongfu group to winch the steel wire rope; the workers of the Kuang Yongfu group also completed the winching work of the steel wire rope in one point and twenty minutes due to the improvement of the operation method.
