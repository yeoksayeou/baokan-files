    The North China Cadre Cultural Remedial School opened on April 16th. This school was established by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to systematically improve the cultural level of veteran worker and peasant cadres.

    The 320 students who have already arrived at the school are veteran worker and peasant cadres above the level of Deputy Secretary of the CPC County Committee and County Head of the People's Government, drawn from various parts of North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Most of these cadres have been tempered by the War of Resistance Against Japan or the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and nearly two-thirds have participated in revolutionary struggles for more than fifteen years. There are 125 current CPC County Committee Secretaries and People's Government County Heads. Thirty-eight are above the level of CPC Prefectural Committee Member. The others are all responsible cadres of various units. Shi Yulin, First Deputy Director of the Hebei Provincial CPC Committee's Supervisory Committee, and others also participated in this study session. Guo Shangyi, the forty-year-old Director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Real Estate Administration Bureau, also came. Under the long-term education of the Party, these cadres have a high level of political awareness and rich experience in struggle. They deeply understand the needs of the new situation for them and the Party's concern for them. They have a high determination and enthusiasm for learning. Wei Fanchu, an old party member who is already fifty-six years old, has also enthusiastically and vigorously begun his cultural learning life.

    At the opening ceremony, Zhang Panshi, Fourth Deputy Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended and delivered a speech. He said that as the country enters a period of planned economic construction, the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao are very concerned about and attach great importance to the cultural and educational work of worker and peasant cadres. He asked the students to treat this study as a political task to be completed, strive to be good students in cultural learning, give play to their inherent political enthusiasm and experience in practical work, apply the spirit and wisdom of overcoming Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and landlords to their studies, overcome all difficulties, and successfully complete the study plan. He hoped that the students would pay attention to politics and live a good political life in their studies; they should also pay attention to physical exercise, which is the capital to guarantee learning.

    After the establishment of the North China Cadre Cultural Remedial School, it will draw members of the CPC Prefectural Committees, County Committee Secretaries, and People's Government County Heads whose cultural level is not high enough to meet junior high school standards, in batches and in three phases. The study period for each phase will be one and a half years. It is estimated that within five years, all of the more than 1,100 cadres in the region with this cultural level can be raised to the level of junior high school graduates.

    华北干部文化补习学校开学
    华北干部文化补习学校在四月十六日开学。这个学校是中共中央华北局为有计划地提高工农老干部的文化程度而创办的。
    现在已经到校的三百二十名学员，都是从华北各地和内蒙古自治区抽调的中共县委副书记、人民政府县长以上的工农老干部。这些干部多数都经过抗日战争或第二次国内革命战争的锻炼，有近三分之二参加过十五年以上的革命斗争。现任中共县委书记、人民政府县长的就有一百二十五人。中共地委委员以上的有三十八人。其他也都是各单位的一定负责干部。中共河北省委监察委员会第一副主任史玉林等都参加了这一期学习。四十多岁的天津市人民政府房地产管理局局长郭尚义也来了。这些干部在党的长期教育下，政治觉悟较高，又具有较丰富的斗争经验，他们深切了解新形势对他们的需要和党对他们的关怀，学习决心和热情都很高，年已五十六岁的老党员卫范初，也热情蓬勃地开始了他的文化学习生活。
    在开学典礼会上，中共中央华北局第四副书记张磐石到会讲话。他说，在国家进入有计划经济建设时期，中共中央和毛主席十分关怀和重视工农干部的文化教育工作。他要求学员们把这次学习当成政治任务来完成，努力做文化学习上的好学生，发挥固有的政治热情和实际工作的经验，将过去战胜日寇、蒋匪帮和地主阶级的精神、智慧运用到学习上，克服一切困难，胜利地完成学习计划。他希望学员们在学习中要关心政治，过好政治生活；也要注意锻炼身体，这是保证学习的资本。
    华北干部文化补习学校建立后，将分批抽调中共地委委员、县委书记和人民政府县长中文化水平不够初中程度者，先后分三期入校学习，每期学习时间为一年半，预计五年内可把全区一千一百多名此种文化程度的干部，全部提高到初中毕业的水平。（据新华社讯）
