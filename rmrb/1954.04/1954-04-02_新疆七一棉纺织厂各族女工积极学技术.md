Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory: Female Workers of All Ethnic Groups Actively Learn Technology

The thirty-four female workers (including five ethnic groups: Uyghur, Kazakh, Sibe, Hui, and Manchu) recruited by the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory in Urumqi, southern Xinjiang, and Yili, etc., have gone to the workshops to learn production technology.

The Han female workers believe that helping female workers of fraternal ethnic groups to learn is a very glorious task, and they all hope to have female workers of fraternal ethnic groups assigned to their groups. When female workers of fraternal ethnic groups learn technology, the Han female workers patiently explain the basic knowledge of operating the machines to them, demonstrate for them, and encourage and help them practice operating. The female workers of fraternal ethnic groups are in high spirits to learn technology. In less than a month, they have initially learned various production operation techniques. Mao Peiyu (Manchu) and Zhao Meilan (Sibe), female workers learning technology in the carding, drawing, and roving workshops, can now independently watch the machines. Hui female workers Ma Caifeng and Ma Xiuying can now watch two hundred fine yarn spindles. Han female workers are also very concerned about the lives of female workers of fraternal ethnic groups. The workshops and dormitories are full of an atmosphere of unity and friendship.

    新疆七一棉纺织厂各族女工积极学技术
    新疆七一棉纺织厂在乌鲁木齐市、南疆和伊犁等地招收的三十四名女工（包括维吾尔、哈萨克、锡伯、回、满等五个民族）已下车间学习生产技术。
    汉族女工们认为帮助兄弟民族女工学习是非常光荣的任务，她们都希望把兄弟民族女工分到自己的小组来。兄弟民族女工们学习技术的时候，汉族女工们很耐心地给她们讲解操作机器的基本知识，并且表演给她们看，鼓励和帮助她们练习操作，兄弟民族女工学习技术的情绪很高，不到一个月，她们已经初步学会了各种生产操作技术。在梳棉、并条、粗纱车间学习技术的毛培玉（满族）、赵美兰
  （锡伯族）等女工，现在已经能单独看机器了。回族女工马才凤、马秀英已能看二百个细纱锭了。汉族女工也非常关心兄弟民族女工的生活，在车间里，在宿舍里，都充满了团结友爱的气氛。
