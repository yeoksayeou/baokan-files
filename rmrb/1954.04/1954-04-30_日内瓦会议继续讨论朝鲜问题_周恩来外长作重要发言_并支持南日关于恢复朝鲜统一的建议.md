Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 28th: The Geneva Conference continued in the afternoon of the 28th, chaired by the British representative, British Foreign Secretary Eden.

The first to speak was the American representative, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles.

Dulles's speech, like that of South Korean representative Byun Young-tae on the 27th, showed no sincerity in negotiating a solution to the problem and did not offer any new suggestions.

Dulles first distorted the history of Korea since 1945, slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, and denied the responsibility of the United States for creating the division of Korea and launching the Korean War.

Dulles repeatedly repeated the lie of so-called "communist expansion" and, taking the long unresolved German and Austrian issues as examples, predicted that the Geneva Conference would be "fruitless," thereby spreading a pessimistic atmosphere.

Dulles could not offer any remotely justifiable reasons to oppose the reasonable plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue proposed by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il at yesterday's meeting.

Dulles first opposed Nam Il's suggestion of holding free elections throughout Korea, excluding foreign interference. Dulles also opposed Nam Il's proposal that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea within six months. He created a strange logic, saying that because the United States is too far from Korea, it would be difficult for American troops to return after withdrawal, so they should not withdraw. This exposes the U.S.'s ambition to occupy South Korea indefinitely. Dulles understood that if free elections were held throughout Korea without foreign interference, the unpopular South Korean government would be "destroyed."

Dulles actually proposed using the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7, 1950, under the manipulation of the United States, as a "practical and feasible plan" for unifying Korea. According to this illegal resolution, Dulles suggested that the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea should supervise elections in North Korea "to complete the work of the United Nations." That is to say, the United States has not abandoned its ambition to annex North Korea under the guise of the United Nations. Dulles repeatedly demanded the implementation of the so-called United Nations resolution on unifying Korea, while completely ignoring the principle that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, attempting to impose the will of the United States on the Korean people. This attitude obviously cannot be considered sincere in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

The chief representative of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, then spoke (full text to be published separately).

After Zhou Enlai finished his speech, the chairman announced that no one else had registered to speak today, and the meeting adjourned to continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to TASS, Geneva, 29th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference held its third meeting on April 28th, chaired by Eden. The conference continued to discuss the Korean issue.

Many political observers pointed out that after the DPRK delegation put forward suggestions on the 27th including measures designed to quickly restore the national unity of Korea and establish a unified, independent and democratic Korea, the discussion of this issue has had a concrete foundation.

Dulles spoke first on the 28th. He acknowledged that Korea has the right to exist as a unified, indivisible, and independent nation and said that the purpose of the meeting was to establish a unified Korea. But in talking about the reasons why Korea is still divided into two parts, Dulles attempted to shift the responsibility for creating this situation from the United States to the Soviet Union. He repeated a set of stale and discredited American arguments, which are completely inconsistent with the facts, regarding the development of the situation in Korea after its liberation from Japanese rule. Dulles made no mention of the fact that the South Korean authorities, on the orders of the United States, ignored the proposals repeatedly made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of Korea and the end of the division. This division was caused by the United States' arbitrary violation of the agreement on the Korean issue reached at the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in December 1945, and its immediate efforts to divide Korea and suppress democratic forces in Korea after the Moscow Conference.

The U.S. Secretary of State also attempted to portray the U.S.'s armed intervention in Korea as an act of aggression by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the assistance given by the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people in their struggle against foreign interventionists as an act of aggression by the People's Republic of China.

Dulles also distorted the development of the situation after the conclusion of the armistice agreement, his purpose being to conceal from public opinion the responsibility that the United States should bear for the fact that the Korean issue has not yet achieved a final peaceful resolution.

Dulles did not mention the specific plan proposed by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for resolving the Korean issue until the final part of his speech.

Dulles found some false arguments to justify his opposition to the implementation of this plan. He showed a blatant distrust of the democratic forces of the Korean people, insisting that elections in Korea could only be conducted under foreign supervision. He opposed the suggestion of the DPRK delegation that all foreign armed forces withdraw from Korea within six months, even though this suggestion could avoid exerting various kinds of pressure on the Korean people and the possibility of interfering in their internal affairs during elections, and could become an important step towards the peaceful unification of Korea on a democratic basis.

Dulles made it clear that the United States does not intend to withdraw its troops from South Korea, thus once again acknowledging that the South Korean regime relies on the support of foreign armed forces.

While rejecting the proposals of the DPRK delegation, Dulles still said that the United States was trying to unify Korea. However, he did not offer any suggestions for achieving this goal, which shows that what he said about the United States hoping to promote the peaceful unification of Korea was nothing more than empty words. Thus, Dulles showed that the United States opposes the genuine unification of Korea and is willing to expand the puppet regime of Syngman Rhee to the whole of Korea with the help and cooperation of the so-called United Nations Commission, which he defended.

Next, the chief representative and Foreign Minister of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, spoke.

Zhou Enlai's speech was listened to with great attention. In his speech, he spoke about the unprecedented achievements made by the People's Republic of China in politics, economy and culture in Chinese history. He said that the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people have always worked for peace. Zhou Enlai said: "We respect the right of the people of all countries to choose and maintain their own way of life and national system without foreign interference; at the same time, we also ask other countries to treat us with the same attitude."

Speaking of Sino-Soviet relations, Zhou Enlai emphasized that the increasingly consolidated friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has played and is playing an extremely important role in defending and consolidating the cause of peace not only in the Far East but also in the world.

He also pointed out that some countries, especially the United States, are unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China and are trying to ignore the right of the Chinese people to choose their own national system, which hinders the peaceful resolution of pressing world problems, especially pressing Asian problems, and increases the tension and unease in international relations. Zhou Enlai said that the Geneva Conference should lay the foundation for changing this state of affairs.

The chief representative of the Chinese delegation then said that the People's Republic of China attaches great importance to the solution of the Korean issue based on the interests of consolidating peace in the Far East and the national interests of the Korean people.

Zhou Enlai said that the delegation of the People's Republic of China fully supports the proposal made by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on restoring the national unity of Korea and holding free elections throughout Korea. Zhou Enlai spoke about American aggression, saying that these actions should be stopped and peace in Asia should be guaranteed. He pointed out that Dulles's speech at the meeting today was contrary to these demands. Zhou Enlai said that his government believes that Asian countries should consult with each other and make joint efforts to maintain peace and security in Asia by undertaking corresponding obligations.

In his speech, Zhou Enlai also expressed his support for consolidating peace in Europe and other regions of the world, stopping the rearmament of West Germany, and guaranteeing European security through the collective efforts of all European countries as proposed by the Soviet Union, reducing armaments and armies, and banning the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Finally, Zhou Enlai expressed his hope that the representatives participating in the Geneva Conference would work hard to resolve the pressing issues on the conference agenda.

### 日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题  周恩来外长作重要发言  并支持南日关于恢复朝鲜统一的建议

    日内瓦会议继续讨论朝鲜问题
    周恩来外长作重要发言
    并支持南日关于恢复朝鲜统一的建议
    据新华社日内瓦二十八日电：日内瓦会议在二十八日下午继续举行，由英国代表、英国外交大臣艾登担任主席。
    首先发言的是美国代表、美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    杜勒斯的发言和南朝鲜代表卞荣泰二十七日的发言一样，没有表示丝毫愿意协商解决问题的诚意，也没有提出任何新的建议。
    杜勒斯首先歪曲一九四五年以来朝鲜的历史，诽谤朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联，抵赖美国制造朝鲜南北分裂的局面、发动侵略朝鲜战争的责任。
    杜勒斯一再重复所谓“共产主义扩张”的谎言，并拿德国问题和奥地利问题长期以来未获解决为例，预言这次日内瓦会议将是“徒劳无益”，借此散布悲观空气。
    杜勒斯提不出任何稍为站得住脚的理由，就反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在昨天会议上提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的合理方案。
    杜勒斯首先反对南日主张在全朝鲜举行排除外国干涉的自由选举的建议。杜勒斯还反对南日关于一切外国军队应在六个月内从朝鲜撤退的建议。他创造了一个奇怪的逻辑，他说，因为美国距离朝鲜太远，美国军队撤退后回来不易，因此不应该撤退。这就暴露了美国要无限期占领南朝鲜的野心。杜勒斯懂得，如果在全朝鲜举行不受外力干涉的自由选举，不得人心的南朝鲜政府就将被“摧毁”。
    杜勒斯居然提出把一九五零年十月七日联合国大会在美国操纵下通过的非法决议作为统一朝鲜的
  “切实可行的方案”。根据这个非法决议，杜勒斯建议由联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会监督在朝鲜北部举行选举，“以完成联合国的工作”。这就是说，美国仍然没有放弃其假联合国之名以并吞朝鲜北部的野心。杜勒斯口口声声要求实现所谓联合国统一朝鲜的决议，而根本不提朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己来解决的原则，企图将美国的意志强加于朝鲜人民身上。这种态度显然不能被认为有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来接着发言（全文另发）。
    在周恩来发言结束以后，主席宣布已没有人报名在今天发言，会议休会至明日继续举行。
    据新华社二十九日讯：据塔斯社日内瓦二十九日电：日内瓦外长会议于四月二十八日举行第三次会议，由艾登担任主席。会议继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    许多政治观察家指出，在二十七日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出了包含着目的在于早日恢复朝鲜国家统一和建立统一、独立、民主的朝鲜的措施的建议以后，讨论这个问题已经有了具体的基础。
      杜勒斯在二十八日首先发言。他承认朝鲜有作为一个统一不可分的、独立的国家而生存的权利，并且说会议的目的是建立一个统一的朝鲜。但是在谈到朝鲜迄今还分裂为两部分的原因时，杜勒斯企图把造成这种局势的责任从美国转嫁到苏联身上。他对于朝鲜在从日本统治下获得解放后的局势发展，重复了陈腐的、早已被揭穿的一套美国说法，这套说法是完全不符合事实的。杜勒斯丝毫没有提到南朝鲜当局按照美国的命令对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一再提出的和平统一朝鲜并结束分裂局面的建议置之不理的情况。这种分裂局面，是由于美国恣意违反一九四五年十二月在苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议上获得的关于朝鲜问题的协议，并在莫斯科会议后立即着手分裂朝鲜和压制朝鲜民主力量所引起的。
      美国国务卿又企图把美国对朝鲜的武装干涉说成是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国方面的侵略行为，把中国人民志愿军在朝鲜人民反对外国干涉者的斗争中给予朝鲜人民的援助说成是中华人民共和国方面的侵略行为。
    杜勒斯也同样歪曲了停战协定缔结后的局势发展，他的目的就是在舆论面前掩盖美国对于朝鲜问题所以还没有获得最后和平解决所应负的责任。
    杜勒斯一直到他的发言的最后部分，才提到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团提出的解决朝鲜问题的具体方案的建议。
    杜勒斯找出一些虚假的论据来为他反对实行这个方案辩解。他对朝鲜人民的民主力量显示了公然的不信任，硬说朝鲜的选举只有在外国监督下才能进行。他反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团关于使一切外国武装力量在六个月内撤出朝鲜的建议，虽然这个建议可以避免对朝鲜人民施加各种压力和在选举时干涉他们内政的可能性，可以成为走向在民主基础上和平统一朝鲜的重要步骤。
    杜勒斯使人明白：美国并不打算从南朝鲜撤出它的军队，这样就再一次承认了南朝鲜政权是依靠外国武装力量的支持的。
    杜勒斯一面拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的建议，一面还是说美国在设法统一朝鲜。但是，他却没有提出达到这个目的的建议，这就表明他所说的什么美国希望促成朝鲜的和平统一，都不过是一篇空话。这样，杜勒斯就表明，美国反对朝鲜的真正统一，而愿意在他所为之辩护的所谓联合国委员会的帮助和合作之下，把李承晚傀儡政权扩大到整个朝鲜。
    接着，中华人民共和国代表团首席代表、外交部部长周恩来发言。
    周恩来的发言受到大家注意倾听。他在发言中谈到中华人民共和国在政治、经济和文化上取得的中国历史上空前的成就。他说，中华人民共和国政府和中国人民一贯为和平而努力。周恩来说：“我们尊重各国人民的选择和维护他们自己的生活方式和国家制度而不受外来干涉的权利；同时，我们也要求其他国家用同样的态度对待我们。”
    谈到苏中关系时，周恩来强调指出：中国人民和苏联人民日益巩固的友谊，不仅在远东、而且在全世界保卫和巩固和平的事业中，起了并起着极其巨大的作用。
    他还指出，有些国家，首先是美国不愿意承认中华人民共和国，并力图无视中国人民选择自己国家制度的权利，这妨碍了世界迫切问题、特别是亚洲迫切问题的和平解决，增加了国际关系的紧张和不安。周恩来说，日内瓦会议应该为改变这种状态奠定基础。
    中国代表团首席代表接着说，中华人民共和国基于巩固远东和平的利益和朝鲜人民的民族利益，对于朝鲜问题的解决极为重视。
    周恩来说，中华人民共和国代表团完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相所提出的关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜的自由选举的建议。周恩来谈到美国的侵略行动时说：这些行动应该被制止，亚洲的和平应该得到保证。他指出，杜勒斯今天在会议上的发言是同这些要求相反的。周恩来说，他的政府认为，亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。
    周恩来在发言中还赞成：巩固欧洲和世界其他地区的和平，停止武装西德，如苏联所建议的那样由所有欧洲国家集体努力来保证欧洲的安全，裁减军备和军队并禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。
    最后，周恩来表示希望参加日内瓦会议的代表能努力来解决会议议程上的迫切问题。
