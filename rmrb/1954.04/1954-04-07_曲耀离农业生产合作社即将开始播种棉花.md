    Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative to Begin Sowing Cotton Soon
    The agricultural production cooperative led by Qu Yaoli, a cotton production model worker from Quzhuangtou Township, Jie County, Shanxi Province, has completed its preparations for cotton planting and is about to start plowing and sowing.
    The Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative has grown from ten households last year to eighty-three households, and the total cultivated land area has also expanded from more than 150 mu to more than 1,200 mu. Under the principle of not affecting grain production increases, it is planned to appropriately expand the cotton planting area and increase the unit area yield of cotton fields. The entire cooperative plans to plant 598 mu of cotton this year, requiring the production of 160,000 jin of seed cotton. The target is an average yield of 378 jin of seed cotton per mu for irrigated cotton fields, a 15 percent increase over last year; and an average yield of 172 jin of seed cotton per mu for dryland cotton fields, a 22 percent increase over last year. Thirteen mu of high-yield irrigated cotton fields have been cultivated, with a required production of 750 jin of seed cotton per mu.
    Currently, all 1.5 million jin of fertilizer have been delivered to the fields, and more than 90 percent of the cotton fields have been applied with 3,000 to 7,000 jin of pen manure per mu as base fertilizer. More than 11,900 jin of cotton seeds have also been sun-dried and selected. The cooperative has signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 2,500 jin of fertilizer powder and 500 jin of "666" insecticide powder, as well as two hand-cranked sprayers.
    In order to further prepare for spring plowing, promote technological reforms, and strive to complete cotton field sowing in a timely manner, at the end of March, Qu Yaoli and all the cadres of the cooperative, based on the technical reform experience of recent years, proposed new yield-increasing technical measures that must be carefully implemented before sowing, including "preparing the land to preserve moisture, increasing the application of base fertilizer, selecting and sun-drying seeds, and densely planting for full stands." They also led various production teams in studying and formulating plans. Recently, the cooperative plans to mobilize mutual aid teams and individual farmers throughout the village to weed, in order to prevent the spread and occurrence of aphids and ensure the universal high yield of cotton fields throughout the village and the cooperative.

    曲耀离农业生产合作社即将开始播种棉花
    山西省解县曲庄头乡棉花丰产模范曲耀离所领导的农业生产合作社，已完成种棉准备工作，即将开犁下种。
    曲耀离农业生产合作社已由去年的十户发展到八十三户，耕地总面积也由一百五十多亩扩大到一千二百多亩。在不影响增产粮食的原则下，计划适当扩大棉花种植面积，并要提高棉田的单位面积产量。全社今年计划种棉五百九十八亩，要求生产十六万斤籽棉。水地棉花要求每亩平均产籽棉三百七十八斤，比去年提高百分之十五；旱地棉花每亩平均产籽棉一百七十二斤，比去年提高百分之二十二，并培养了十三亩水地棉花丰产地，每亩要求生产七百五十斤籽棉。
    现在，一百五十万斤的肥料已全部送到地里，百分之九十以上的棉田每亩已施了三千斤到七千斤圈粪的底肥。一万一千九百多斤棉籽也已经过翻晒、挑选。全社和供销合作社订立了合同，购买肥田粉两千五百斤、“六六六 ”杀虫药粉五百斤，手摇喷雾器两架。
    为进一步做好春耕准备工作，推行技术改革，争取适时完成棉田下种，三月底，曲耀离和全社干部根据近年来的技术改革经验，提出了播种前必须认真做好“整地保墒、增施底肥、选种晒种、密植全苗”等新的增产技术措施。并领导各个生产小组研究制订了计划。最近，该社计划发动全村互助组和个体农民进行除草，以防止蚜虫的蔓延和发生，保证全村和全社棉田的普遍丰产。
