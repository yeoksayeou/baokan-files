East China has achieved preliminary success in the grain quality census actively carried out by grain departments in various locations across the region. During February and March, grain departments throughout East China conducted a comprehensive grain quality census, with relevant leading authorities generally dispatching cadres to the grassroots level for inspection, supervision, and concrete assistance. In the process of the census, various localities discovered and promptly dealt with a batch of unsafe grain. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen counties in Fujian Province, over 3,450,000 *jin* of unsafe grain have been processed during the census. Simultaneously, 340-plus warehouses were cleaned, more than 500 *dan* of garbage were removed, and 67 ditches were cleared and dredged. Wenzhou Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, taking advantage of seven sunny days, sun-dried more than 18,500,000 *jin* of grain. Huang County in Shandong Province turned over 2,400,000 *jin* of corn in warehouses, exposed 82,000-plus *jin* of corn to the sun, and stored a portion of the sun-dried corn using the "dry sand sealing" method to prevent insect infestation.

Recently, the Grain Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee instructed grain departments in various localities in East China to continue processing unsafe grain based on existing achievements, especially to reduce the moisture content of high-moisture grain, to ensure the safe storage of grain during the plum rain season. Grain departments in various localities are currently continuing to organize forces to deeply develop the grain storage protection campaign. (Li Jiaquan, Tao Mingpan, Qian Jinyu)

    华东各地开展粮质普查取得初步成绩
    华东区各地粮食部门积极开展粮质普查工作，已经取得初步成绩。华东各地粮食部门在二、三月份全面进行了粮质普查工作，有关领导机关一般都抽派干部深入基层，进行了检查督促和具体帮助。在普查过程中，各地都发现和及时处理了一批不安全粮食。福建省据十四个县的不完全统计，在普查中已处理不安全粮食三百四十五万多斤，同时打扫仓房三百四十多座，清除垃圾五百多担，清理和疏通水沟六十七条。浙江省温州专区利用七个晴天，即翻晒一千八百五十多万斤粮食。山东省黄县把二百四十多万斤玉米倒仓，曝晒了八万二千多斤玉米，并将一部分晒好的玉米用“干沙密闭”的方法储存起来，以防虫害。
    最近华东行政委员会粮食局指示华东各地粮食部门在现有成绩的基础上，继续处理不安全粮食，特别是要降低高水分粮食的水分，以保证储粮安度梅雨季节。各地粮食部门现正继续组织力量，深入开展查仓保粮运动。（李家泉　陶铭盘　钱金玉）
