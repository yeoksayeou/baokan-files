Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 31st: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution regarding the Berlin Conference.

    The resolution states: The WFTU Executive Bureau is pleased to see that the Berlin Conference is the result of the powerful movement of people from all countries, especially the broad masses of working people, striving for a peaceful settlement of outstanding international issues to maintain and strengthen peace.

    The Berlin Conference decided that the governments of the Four Powers would take measures to promote a smooth resolution of the disarmament issue, or at least a substantial reduction in armaments.

    This resolution confirms the just nature of the working class and the people of all countries' heroic struggle against the expansion of armaments; it can promote the further development of the peace movement.

    The WFTU and its affiliated trade union organizations are fully determined to take new steps to reduce the burden of military expenditure that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the working people.

    The Berlin Conference also decided to convene a conference in Geneva on April 26, 1954, with the participation of the People's Republic of China. This will allow the People's Republic of China to assume its rightful place among the major powers, helping to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The WFTU, representing its more than eighty million members, welcomes this resolution and believes that it also expresses the views of millions of people who have not yet joined the WFTU. It hereby declares its full support for the people of Indochina who are yearning for the restoration of peace, freedom, and national independence.

    The WFTU Executive Bureau believes that if a genuine and stable European security system is to be established, it must be based on an all-European collective security treaty with the participation of all European countries without exception. This treaty can help establish a common front against war, guaranteeing collective strength to repel aggression, rather than rearming West Germany and forming different groups of European countries in opposition to each other.

    Therefore, the WFTU calls on trade unions in European countries, especially the German working class, to prevent the revival of German militarism and revanchism, which constitutes a serious threat to peace and international security.

    The WFTU hopes that the negotiations between the Four Powers and the Austrian government will reach an agreement to conclude a peace treaty with Austria in accordance with the interests of the Austrian people and the interests of European peace and security.

    The resolution points out that through concerted action, the working people and their trade unions are able to and must play a decisive role in the struggle for the victory of the cause of peace.

    The resolution concludes by saying that the WFTU solemnly declares its firm determination to strive for the unity of action of the working people of all countries at home and abroad, so that the great cause of disarmament, easing international tensions, and safeguarding peace will be victorious.

    世界工联执行局通过关于柏林会议的决议
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳三十一日讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议通过了一项关于柏林会议的决议。
    决议说：世界工联执行局满意地看到，柏林会议是各国人民、首先是广大的劳动人民大众争取和平解决悬而未决的国际问题以保持并加强和平的强大运动的结果。
    柏林会议决定，四大国政府采取措施，以促进裁军问题或至少是大量缩减军备问题的顺利解决。
    这个决议证实了工人阶级与各国人民反对扩充军备的英勇斗争的正义性质；它可以促进和平运动的进一步开展。
    世界工联及其所属工会组织有充分的决心采取新的步骤，争取削减沉重地压在劳动人民肩上的军费负担。
    柏林会议又决定于一九五四年四月二十六日在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议，这样，中华人民共和国就将取得它在大国中应有的地位，以帮助实现朝鲜问题的和平解决，并讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。
    世界工联代表它的八千多万会员欢迎这个决议，并相信这也表达了千千万万还没有参加世界工联的人们的意见。它在这里宣布：它以全力支持渴望恢复和平、自由与民族独立的印度支那人民。
    世界工联执行局认为，如果要建立真正的和稳固的欧洲安全体系，那么这个体系必须以所有欧洲国家毫无例外地参加的全欧集体安全条约为基础。这个条约可以有助于成立一个反对战争、保证以集体力量击退侵略的共同阵线，而不是重新武装西德和使欧洲国家结成不同的集团对立起来。
    因此，世界工联号召欧洲各国工会，首先是德国工人阶级阻止构成对和平与国际安全的严重威胁的德国军国主义和复仇主义的复活。
    世界工联希望，四大国与奥地利政府之间的谈判能够取得协议，按照奥地利人民的利益以及欧洲和平与安全的利益缔结对奥和约。
    决议指出，通过一致的行动，劳动人民和他们的工会是能够并且必须在争取和平事业胜利的斗争中起决定性作用的。
    决议最后说，世界工联庄严地宣布，它有坚定的决心争取实现各国劳动人民在国内和国际上的行动一致，以使裁减军备、缓和国际紧张局势与维护和平的伟大事业获得胜利。
