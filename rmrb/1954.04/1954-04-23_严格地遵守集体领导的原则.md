Editorial:

    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that the unity of the Party, the unity of the working class, the unity of the toiling people, and the unity of the people of the whole country are the fundamental guarantees for the victory of the revolution. The unity of the responsible comrades of the Party's Central Committee and provincial (municipal) committees and above, as well as the senior responsible comrades of the armed forces, is the key to the unity of the entire Party. To achieve the above-mentioned unity, it is particularly required that these senior responsible comrades strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership. Because only through collective discussion of issues and collective decision-making by leading cadres can the unity and solidarity of the Party ranks in thought and action be guaranteed.

    Collective leadership requires that all major issues concerning policies and principles, and concerning the lives of the broad masses, be brought to the Party committee (plenary session or standing committee meeting) for full discussion, and then correct conclusions be drawn. In the collective discussion, implement mutual supplementation and mutual correction in order to make correct and satisfactory conclusions on the work of the Party.

    In the leading group of our Party's senior Party committees, there are experienced people from all aspects, and these people maintain close ties with the Party's activists and have a grasp of all aspects of the situation and problems. As long as the main leading cadres can strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership, as long as they can fully utilize collective wisdom, they can ensure that correct decisions are made and correct leadership is realized. As Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "In all the actual work of our Party, all correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses. That is to say, the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) are concentrated (after research, transformed into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then go to the masses for propaganda and explanation, transformed into the opinions of the masses, so that the masses adhere to them, see them in action, and test whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Then concentrate them from the masses again, and then persist in them among the masses. Such an infinite cycle, more correct, more vivid, and richer each time."
  ("Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership")

    Since the Zunyi Conference, the Party has formed a unified and united Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of the correct political line and organizational line. This committee includes outstanding members from all fields, outstanding politicians, outstanding military strategists, outstanding social activists, outstanding theorists, outstanding propagandists, and outstanding experts of all kinds. In this committee, each member can not only put forward their own opinions and suggestions, but also reflect the opinions and suggestions of the vast number of Party members and the masses, and jointly discuss and decide on issues. This ensures that the Party can continuously put forward the correct political line and organizational line. This ensures that the Party can timely overcome hostile activities and erroneous tendencies that endanger the Party's unity, achieve the unity of the proletariat. This ensures that the Party can lead the working class, the toiling people, and the people of the whole country to overcome any sabotage by enemies at home and abroad, and build a new China. This will also surely guarantee the victory of the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    Therefore, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often educate all Party comrades that they must strictly abide by the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership, resolutely oppose decentralism and individualism, oppose treating their own regions and departments as independent kingdoms, oppose putting individuals above the organization, oppose inappropriately overemphasizing the role of individuals, and oppose complacency and the cult of personality. The Central Committee issued the "Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit" in July 1941, the "Decision on Unifying the Leadership of the Party in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas and Adjusting the Relationships Between Various Organizations" in September 1942, and the "Instruction on Improving the Committee System of the Party Committee" in September 1948. Comrade Mao Zedong, in his many works, especially in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," pointed out the role of collective leadership extremely profoundly, calling on the entire Party, not only the Party committees at all levels, but all large and small institutions and schools, to establish a leadership core and give play to the role of collective leadership in accordance with the ninth article of Stalin's "On the Bolshevization of the Party."

    However, some comrades do not recognize the problem in this way, but are overwhelmed by the current achievements and have developed extremely dangerous arrogance, even treating these achievements as individual achievements. Therefore, they exaggerate the role of individuals and emphasize their own "correctness." A very wrong statement and practice has arisen among them, namely, they believe that as long as their opinions are considered correct, they can disregard the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership, are not bound by Party discipline, can disobey leadership, and do not act in accordance with the Party Constitution. If these people are Party committee secretaries or Party group secretaries, they often make decisions on their own regarding major issues concerning policies and the lives of the broad masses, without discussing them with the Party committee or without sufficient discussion; or they modify the decisions of the Party committee according to their own intentions. At Party committee meetings, instead of encouraging the committee members to put forward their own opinions, or humbly listening to the opinions of the committee members and learning from others in every way, they often self-righteously deliver a long speech of affirmative opinions first, letting the committee members only come to listen to their "instructions," and often even completely deprive other committee members of the opportunity to express their opinions because of their long speeches. In order to insist on their own self-righteously correct opinions, or in order to pass their own decisions, they do not hesitate to engage in sophistry and quibbling, or even seize on individual shortcomings or individual errors in others' speeches to carry out extraneous refutations, attempting to prove that the fundamental problems of others are also wrong by proving the errors of branch problems. In short, such people use their position and their sophistry and autocratic attitude to achieve the goal of individual decision-making.

    If these people are general responsible cadres, they emphasize the special nature of their department's work. They believe that the Party committee is not familiar with their work and cannot put forward practical opinions on their work, so they do not ask for instructions or report on issues that should be reported to the Party committee. They make decisions on their own regarding major policy issues without submitting them to the Party committee for discussion. When instructions come from higher-level business departments, they do not transmit and discuss them in the Party committee, but directly hand them over to lower-level organs for implementation. When they return from meetings attended by higher-level business departments, they do not report to the Party committee, but implement them in their own departments. When the Party committee designates them to report on the work of their department, they report a lot of purely business-related technical issues in order to show off their specialized talents, while in fact making it difficult for the committee members to put forward opinions on their work. When others offer opinions on their work, they often use "you don't understand the specific situation" as a shield to keep people at a distance. When he drafts instructions on behalf of the Party committee and submits them to the committee for discussion, he rudely refuses to modify the instructions according to the opinions of other committee members and the secretary; he even resorts to hooligan tactics, saying: "You don't know, I know. You can rest assured to approve, I am fully responsible, if there is a problem, cut off my head."

    Violating the system of collective leadership is a principled error. No compromise can be made on principled errors, and they cannot be allowed to grow from small to large; adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards principled errors, no matter what their subjective wishes are, is objectively condoning and shielding them. Many phenomena of Party committees violating the principle of collective leadership were not serious at the beginning. However, due to the lack of regular and serious criticism and self-criticism in the leading group, the sprouts of some leading cadres destroying collective leadership not only do not get timely correction, but also get the nourishment of liberalism. Those people become bolder and bolder, more and more dictatorial, and the complacent arrogance will overwhelm their heads, and individualism will blind their communist conscience, and even develop to the point where as long as he thinks he is right, he can not abide by the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership, can not be bound by Party discipline, can not obey the leadership, and does not act in accordance with the Party Constitution. It can be seen from this that arrogance naturally undermines the principle of collective leadership, and liberalism also undermines the principle of collective leadership. To overcome this arrogance and leadership habits of individualistic indulgence of errors, it is necessary to use the method of collective leadership, especially the method of criticism and self-criticism between leading cadres. This kind of criticism and self-criticism is very sharp and very fierce. Because on the one hand, collectivism must be implemented, and on the other hand, individualism must be implemented. Individualists also think they are correct, which requires arduous ideological struggle. But this will not hinder the unity of the Party but will enhance the unity of the Party, because the purpose of criticism is to implement the principle of the Party's collective leadership and increase the Party's unity. Conversely, if a decadent liberal attitude of "knowing it's wrong, the less said the better; protecting oneself wisely, but seeking no fault" is adopted, it will inevitably weaken and undermine the unity of the Party.

    Sound systems should also be used to consolidate collective leadership. The Party committee system is the basic system for implementing collective leadership. Therefore, this system must be adhered to, and it must be insisted that all major issues of principle be decided after discussion by the Party committee. Before the Party committee's discussion, the members must be notified of the issues to be discussed, necessary reference materials must be provided, and the members must be asked to fully prepare their opinions and actively put forward their own opinions at the meeting. Strict criticism should also be carried out for the erroneous attitude of individual members who do not prepare beforehand, do not speak at the meeting, or do other things at the meeting. Because this unserious attitude towards Party meetings is actually undermining the Party's collective leadership system.

  The Party committee is produced by the Party Congress or the Party Representative Conference. The Party Congress, the Party Representative Conference, and the Party Congress are the highest power organs of the Party, and have the right to inspect the work of the Party committee. Moreover, through the convening of these meetings, the rich experience and wisdom of the Party members and the masses can be used to supplement the deficiencies in the experience of the Party committee. It can also be checked by the majority of Party members on the work of the Party committee to remove or re-elect those who violate the principle of collective leadership. Stalin said at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1937: "The Party masses examine their leaders at activist meetings, at delegate meetings, at congresses, by listening to reports on the work of leading comrades, criticizing their shortcomings, and finally, electing or not electing certain leading comrades to the leading organs." ("On the Shortcomings of Party Work and the Methods of Eliminating Trotskyist Double-Dealers and Other Double-Dealers") At present, many regions have convened such Party Representative Conferences and Party Congresses, strengthened the Party's collective leadership, and enhanced the Party's unity. In the future, Party Representative Conferences and Party Congresses will be convened regularly in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution.

    All Party comrades should recognize that violating the Party's democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership is undermining Party discipline, is undermining Party unity, and undermining Party unity is undermining the Party's highest interests and endangering the Party's life. Therefore, we must fight against this erroneous behavior and resolutely defend the Party's democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership.

### 严格地遵守集体领导的原则

    严格地遵守集体领导的原则
    党的七届四中全会指出：党的团结，工人阶级的团结，劳动人民的团结，全国人民的团结，是革命胜利的基本保证。党的中央委员会和省（市）委员会以上负责同志以及武装部队的高级负责同志的团结又是全党团结的关键。要达到上述的团结，就特别要求这些高级负责同志严格遵守集体领导的原则。因为只有经过领导干部集体讨论问题，集体决定问题，才能保证党的队伍在思想上和行动上的统一和团结。
    集体领导要求一切有关政策性原则性的、有关广大群众生活的重大问题，都提到党的委员会（全体会议或者常务委员会议）上充分讨论，然后作出正确的结论。在集体讨论中，贯彻互相补充、互相修正，以便对党的工作作出正确圆满的结论。
    在我们党的高级党委的领导集团中，拥有各方面有经验的人，而且这些人与党的积极分子保持着密切的联系，掌握各方面的情况和问题，主要领导干部只要能够严格遵守集体领导的原则，只要能够充分地发挥集体智慧，就可以保证作出正确的决定，实现正确的领导。正如毛泽东同志曾经指出的：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。”
  （“关于领导方法的若干问题”）
    遵义会议以来，党就在马克思列宁主义的基础上，在正确的政治路线和组织路线的基础上，形成了以毛泽东同志为首的统一团结的中央委员会。在这个委员会里，包括了各方面的优秀分子，杰出的政治家，杰出的军事家，杰出的社会活动家，杰出的理论家，杰出的宣传家和杰出的各种专门家。在这个委员会里，每个委员不仅可以提出自己的意见和建议，并且可以反映广大党员和广大群众的意见和建议，共同讨论和决定问题，这就保证了党能够不断地提出正确的政治路线和组织路线，这就保证了党能够及时地克服危害党的团结的敌对活动和错误倾向，达到无产阶级的统一，这就保证了党能够领导工人阶级、劳动人民、全国人民战胜了内外敌人的任何破坏，而建设起一个崭新的中国，这也必将保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业的胜利。
    因此党中央和毛泽东同志经常教育全党同志必须严格遵守民主集中制和集体领导的原则，坚决反对分散主义和个人主义，反对把自己的地区和部门当做独立王国，反对把个人放在组织之上，反对不适当地过分强调个人的作用，反对骄傲情绪和个人崇拜。中央在一九四一年七月发布了“关于增强党性的决定”，一九四二年九月发布了“关于统一抗日根据地党的领导及调整各组织间关系的决定”，一九四八年九月发布了“关于健全党委制的指示”。毛泽东同志在他的许多著作中，特别是在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中，极其深刻地指出了集体领导的作用，号召全党，不仅是各级党的委员会，就是一切大小机关学校都应当按照斯大林论党的布尔什维克化的第九条，建立领导核心，发挥集体领导的作用。
    但是有一部分同志却不是这样去认识问题，而是被目前的成就冲昏了头脑，产生了极端危险的骄傲情绪，甚至于把这些成就当作是个人的成就，因而夸大个人的作用，强调自己的“正确”，在他们之中产生一种十分错误的说法和作法，即他们认为：只要他的意见自以为是对的，就可以不遵守民主集中制和集体领导的原则，不受党的纪律的约束，就可以不服从领导，不按党的章程办事。这些人如果是党委书记，或者是党组书记，则对于有关政策性的、有关广大群众生活的重大问题，往往不经党的委员会讨论或者不经过充分的讨论，就擅自作出了决定；或者按照自己意图修改党的委员会决定。在党委会上，不是启发委员们提出自己的意见，也不是虚心听取委员们的意见、处处向别人学习，常常自以为是地首先发表一大篇肯定性的意见，让委员们只是来听取他的“训话”，甚至于常常因为他的大篇演说完全剥夺了其他委员发表意见的机会。为了坚持个人的自以为正确的意见，或者为了通过自己的决定，不惜进行强词夺理的诡辩，甚至抓住别人发言中的个别缺点或个别错误，进行节外生枝的批驳，企图用证明枝节问题的差错来证明别人的根本问题也是错误的。总之，这种人是利用自己的地位，自己诡辩和专横的态度，来达到个人决定问题的目的的。
    这些人如果是一般负责干部，则强调自己部门工作特殊。他们认为党的委员会不熟悉他们的业务，对他们的工作就不可能提出切实可行的意见，因而应该向党的委员会请示报告的问题，不请示报告。对政策性的重大问题，不提交党的委员会讨论，擅自作出了决定。上级业务部门来了指示，不在党的委员会上传达讨论，就交下级机关执行。从上级业务部门参加会议回来，不向党的委员会传达汇报，就在自己主管部门贯彻。在党的委员会指定汇报本部工作情况时，就汇报一大堆纯粹业务性技术性的问题，以炫耀自己的专门材干，同时在事实上使各委员很难对自己的工作提出意见。当别人对自己工作提出意见时，常常以“你不了解具体情况”为挡箭牌，拒人于千里之外。当他代党委起草指示提交委员会讨论时，他横蛮地拒绝根据其他委员和书记的意见来修改指示；甚至耍流氓手段，说：“你们不知道，我知道。你们放心批准，我完全负责，出了问题，砍我的脑袋。”
    违反集体领导制度是一种原则性的错误。对原则性的错误是丝毫不能妥协的，是不能让它由小到大地日益严重的；对待原则性的错误采取自由放任的态度，不管其主观愿望如何，在客观上就是纵容包庇。很多党委违反集体领导原则的现象，开初是并不严重的。但是由于领导集团中缺乏经常性的严肃的批评与自我批评，某些领导干部自行其是的破坏集体领导的萌芽不只得不到及时的纠正，而且得到自由主义的滋养，那些人就越来胆子越大，越来越独断专行，自以为是的骄傲情绪就会冲昏他们的头脑，个人主义就会蒙蔽他们共产主义的良知，甚至于发展到只要他自以为是的时候，就可以不遵守民主集中制和集体领导的原则，就可以不受党的纪律的约束，就可以不服从领导，不按党章办事。由此可见，骄傲情绪自然是破坏集体领导原则的，自由主义也是破坏集体领导原则的。要克服这种骄傲情绪和纵容错误的个人主义的领导习气，必须用集体领导的方法，特别是领导干部之间的批评和自我批评方法。这种批评与自我批评是很尖锐的很激烈的。因为一方面要实行集体主义，另一方面要实行个人主义。个人主义者又自以为是正确的，这就要有艰苦的思想斗争。但这并不会妨碍党的团结而会增强党的团结，因为批评的目的就是为了执行党的集体领导的原则，增加党的团结。相反的，如果采取“明知不对，少说为佳；明哲保身，但求无过”的腐朽的自由主义态度，必然要削弱和破坏党的团结。
    还应该用健全的制度来巩固集体领导。党的委员会制度是实行集体领导的基本制度。因此必须坚持这一制度，必须坚持一切原则性的重大问题，经过党的委员会讨论后才作出决定。党的委员会讨论之前，又必须将所要讨论的问题通知各委员，提供必要的参考资料，并要求各委员充分准备意见，在会议上，积极提出自己的意见。对于个别委员那种事前不准备、会上不发言、或者会上作其他事情的错误态度，也应当进行严格的批判。因为这种对党的会议不严肃的态度，实际上是破坏党的集体领导制度。
  党的委员会是由党员大会或者党的代表大会所产生的，党员大会、党的代表会议，党的代表大会又是党的最高权力机关，有权检查党的委员会的工作，而且通过这些会议的召开，又可以党员群众的丰富的经验和智慧来补充党的委员会的经验的不足，还可以经过广大党员对党委会工作检查，撤消或者改选掉那些破坏集体领导原则的人。斯大林在一九三七年三月的联共（布）中央全会上曾说：“党员群众在积极分子会议上、在代表会议上、在代表大会上审查自己的领导者，其方法是听取领导同志底工作报告，批评他们的缺点，最后，选举或不选举某些领导同志到领导机关。”（“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”）目前已有不少地区召开了这样的党的代表会议、党的代表大会，加强了党的集体领导，增强了党的团结。今后就要按照党章规定，定期召开党的代表会议、党的代表大会。
    全党同志应当认识违反党的民主集中制和集体领导原则，就是破坏党的纪律，就是破坏党的团结，而破坏党的团结，就是破坏党的最高利益，危害党的生命。因此我们必须与这种错误的行为进行斗争，坚决保卫党的民主集中制和集体领导的原则。
