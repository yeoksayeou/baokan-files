    Henan Farmers Begin Sowing Cotton
    Province to Expand Cotton Fields by 875,000 Mu
    Farmers in various parts of Henan Province have begun sowing cotton. On the basis of last year's 10,681,000 mu, the province will complete the expansion of cotton fields by 875,000 mu. The unit area yield is required to increase from last year's 22.9 jin to 29 jin.

    Party and government leaders at all levels in the province attach great importance to the task of expanding cotton fields. Various cadre meetings, cotton farmer representative meetings, and cooperative mutual aid group representative meetings have been held in various places to publicize the importance of expanding cotton fields and to implement policies such as equal burden for grain and cotton land, and the ratio of grain to cotton prices. Many areas have educated farmers on the expansion of cotton fields by organizing them to visit factories. Economic departments have also paid attention to solving the difficulties of cotton farmers in terms of lack of grain, seeds, and fertilizer, and have carried out cotton pre-purchase work. The Daying District of Jia County promptly supplied grain to grain-deficient households, and the supply and marketing cooperative purchased livestock grass from Luoyang and promptly supplied fertilizer to cotton farmers, which strongly promoted the expansion of cotton fields. At the cotton farmer representative meeting in Anyang County, the supply and marketing cooperative signed 374 cotton pre-purchase contracts with the representatives, pre-purchasing more than 3.49 million jin of cotton. Under the slogan "Love the country, plant cotton," farmers in the Anyang area revised their cotton planting plans, forming a craze, and the cotton fields in the entire area expanded from 1,060,000 mu last year to 1,360,000 mu. Luoyang, Puyang, Nanyang, and other areas can also overfulfill their tasks. At present, some cadres in many areas still have a sense of complacency and satisfaction, satisfied with the "vigorous" momentum of spring plowing and production, satisfied that the task of expanding cotton field areas can be completed, and unwilling to closely rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, seize the practical problems that need to be solved most urgently, and guide the production enthusiasm that the masses have already developed into practical actions, so as to ensure the improvement of unit area yield. Guowangdu Village in Anyang County has solved this problem well. While strengthening political and ideological education for farmers and completing the task of expanding cotton fields, the Party branch of the village, with the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative as the core, created the "four checks and four calculations" method, mobilizing farmers to find out the actual difficulties and problems existing in spring plowing and production, and then organized and planned to lead farmers to dig more than 3,000 zhang of ditches and canals, and find fertilizer sources from all aspects, accumulating 2,000 carts of fertilizer, which prominently solved the village's water conservancy and fertilizer problems this spring, thus ensuring the increase in cotton and grain production.

    河南省农民开始播种棉花
    全省将扩大棉田八十七万五千亩
    河南省各地农民开始播种棉花，全省棉田在去年一千零六十八万一千亩的基础上，将完成扩大棉田八十七万五千亩。单位面积产量要求在去年二十二点九斤的基础上提高到二十九斤。
    全省各级党政领导干部对扩大棉田的任务十分重视。各地都分别召开了各种干部会、棉农代表会、合作社互助组代表会，宣传扩大棉田的重要意义，和贯彻了粮地棉地同等负担、粮棉比价等政策。不少地区用组织农民参观工厂的方式，对农民进行扩大棉田的教育。经济部门也注意解决棉农缺粮食、缺种籽、缺肥料等困难，并开展棉花预购工作。郏县大营区及时供应缺粮户粮食，供销社又从洛阳购回牲口草，并及时供应棉农肥料，有力地推动了棉田扩大工作。安阳县在棉农代表会上，供销社与代表们订立了预购棉花合同三百七十四件，预购棉花三百四十九万多斤。安阳专区农民在“爱国家，种棉花”的口号下，修订植棉计划形成热潮，全专区棉田由去年的一百零六万亩扩大到一百三十六万亩。洛阳、濮阳、南阳等专区也能超额完成任务。现在不少地区的干部还存在麻痹自满情绪，满足于春耕生产“轰轰烈烈”的声势，满足于扩大棉田面积的任务能够完成，而不肯紧紧依靠互助合作组织，抓住当前最需要解决的实际问题，把群众已经发扬起来的生产积极性引向实际行动，以便保证单位面积产量的提高。安阳县郭王度村对这方面的问题解决得较好，该村党支部在加强对农民政治思想教育，完成扩大棉田任务的同时，以先锋农业生产合作社为核心，创造了“四查四算”的办法，发动农民找出了春耕生产中存在的实际困难和问题，然后有组织有计划地领导农民挖渠开沟三千多丈，从各方面寻找肥源，积肥二千车，突出地解决了全村今春的水利和肥料问题，这样就使棉粮增产有了保证。　（吕建中）
