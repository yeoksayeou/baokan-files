Shandong Yexian held a meeting of representatives of higher primary school graduates in early March. The central focus of this meeting was to organize and mobilize these graduates to participate in agricultural production.

In the summer of 1953, Yexian had a total of 4,130 higher primary school graduates. Since the large-scale publicity of the general line, most of these graduates have participated in agricultural production, and some have become active participants in production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, some of them are still wavering. This situation has attracted great attention from the Yexian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and this meeting of representatives of higher primary school graduates was convened.

The meeting, through commending typical examples, specifically explained the glorious and great future of higher primary school graduates participating in agricultural production and struggling for the socialist transformation of agriculture. It also encouraged those higher primary school graduates who had already participated in agricultural production to establish a long-term determination to struggle for the socialist transformation of agriculture. At this meeting, Xu Jianchun, a Shandong Provincial Labor Model, reported on her experiences in participating in agricultural production after graduating from higher primary school; Liu Hongen, the head of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuli Township, Thirteenth District, reported on the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation and his cooperative's production plan for 1954.

This meeting provided all the representatives with a good labor education and greatly enhanced their socialist and patriotic consciousness. Representative Fang Jiamei said: "In the past, I thought that I could not serve the people if I did not leave agricultural production, so the more I thought about it, the less I wanted to engage in agriculture, and I tried every means to find a job. Now I understand how confused this thinking was, and how much loss it caused to the country and to myself!" Representative Li Xiuwen said: "In the past, I always felt that engaging in agriculture wronged me. After listening to the reports of Xu Jianchun and Liu Hongen, I finally understood. When I go back this time, I must organize our higher primary school graduates to form a technical group and study hard." All the representatives said in unison: "We must learn from Xu Jianchun and actively participate in agricultural production." They also unanimously expressed that they would convey the spirit of the meeting well when they returned, educate the higher primary school graduates who did not participate in this meeting, and settle down to participate in agricultural production. Some representatives were so eager to go home that they couldn't even wait for the meeting to end, and planned to examine their past erroneous ideas of not settling down to agricultural production in the mutual aid groups.

After the meeting, Li Xiuwen, the representative of Wuli Township, Thirteenth District, conveyed the spirit of the meeting to the higher primary school graduates who did not participate in the representative meeting, and introduced Xu Jianchun's advanced thinking and actions. All 27 higher primary school graduates in the township were greatly encouraged and have actively invested themselves into spring plowing and production. For example, Duan Wenjun researched and introduced the experience of accumulating dry ash, accumulating urine, and eliminating insects in his mutual aid group, which greatly increased the whole group's confidence in increasing production and income in 1954. Group leader Duan Fuan said: "With him in our group, we are guaranteed to produce more grain this year, and we will definitely sell more grain to the state in the autumn."

    山东掖县召开高小毕业生代表会议
    动员和组织高小毕业生参加农业生产
    山东掖县在三月初召开一次高小毕业生代表会议。这次会议的中心内容是组织和动员高小毕业生参加农业生产。
    一九五三年暑期，掖县共有高小毕业生四千一百三十人。自大张旗鼓宣传总路线以来，这些高小毕业生，大部分都参加了农业生产，有一部分并已成为生产和互助合作运动中的积极分子。但是，其中仍有一部分还动摇不定。这种情况引起了中共掖县县委会的极大重视，于是召开了这次高小毕业生代表会议。
    会议通过表扬典型，具体地说明了高小毕业生参加农业生产和为农业的社会主义改造事业而斗争的光荣、伟大前途，并鼓励已经参加农业生产的高小毕业生树立长期地为农业的社会主义改造而斗争的决心。在这次会上，还由山东省劳动模范徐建春报告了她在高小毕业后，参加农业生产的经过；由十三区五里乡第一农业生产合作社社长刘洪恩报告了互助合作的优越性和他的合作社一九五四年的生产计划。
    这次会议使全体到会代表受了一次很好的劳动教育，大大地提高了他们的社会主义和爱国主义觉悟。代表方甲梅说：“以前我认为不脱离农业生产，就不能为人民服务，所以越想越不愿意干农业，千方百计的想门路，找职业。现在才懂得这是多么糊涂的思想，这对国家对个人有多么大的损失！”代表李秀文说：“过去总觉得干农业委屈了自己，听了人家徐建春和刘洪恩的报告，才想通了。这次回去，一定要组织咱们高小毕业生，成立技术小组，好好学习。”全体代表异口同声地说：“要向徐建春学习，积极参加农业生产。”他们并一致表示，回去要好好传达会议精神，教育未参加这次会议的高小毕业生，安心参加农业生产。有些代表甚至等不得会议结束就急着要回家，打算在互助组里检讨过去不安心农业生产的错误思想。
    会后，十三区五里乡的代表李修文，向未参加代表会议的高小毕业生传达了会议的精神，介绍了徐建春的先进思想和行动，全乡二十七名高小毕业生受了很大鼓舞，都已积极投入了春耕生产。如段文均在自己的互助组里研究和介绍了积干灰、积尿、除虫的经验，使全组对一九五四年增加生产、增加收入的信心大为提高，组长段富安说：“俺组里有了他，今年多打粮食保险啦，秋后一定会有更多的粮食卖给国家。”
