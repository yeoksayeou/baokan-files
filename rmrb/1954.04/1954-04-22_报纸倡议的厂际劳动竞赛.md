    Factory Labor Competition Initiated by Newspapers
    After learning from the experience of Soviet local newspapers in economic propaganda, the Xi'an Daily suggested to the Shijiazhuang Daily that the two newspapers jointly propose and organize an inter-factory competition between the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory and the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory.
    The competition proposed and organized by these two newspapers was launched on the basis of the deep friendship established between the workers of the two factories, and was carried out in a planned and prepared manner. When reporting on the process of initiating the competition, the Xi'an Daily said: The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory and the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory are two newly established local state-owned enterprises, and their product quality was not high in the past. Through the increased production and thrift campaign last year, the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory improved its working methods and implemented planned management, and the output and quality of its products have improved significantly compared with the past. The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory once sent people to the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory to learn the "caustic soda boiling blank method", exchange experiences, and study ways to improve quality. The Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory also improved the quality of the milky yellow pigment and improved the problem of uneven edges of the cups after adopting the advanced experience and suggestions of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. The workers of the two factories were greatly encouraged in these activities of exchanging experiences and in their correspondence with each other. In order to further promote the workers of the two factories to improve production and improve product quality, the Xi'an Daily wrote a letter to the Shijiazhuang Daily, and the two newspapers jointly proposed and organized this two-month inter-factory competition with the production of high-quality products as the main content.
    For more than a month, the Xi'an Daily has promoted the development of the competition through its own reports and propaganda. On March 13, the newspaper published on the prominent position of the first page a communication report and photos of the warm brewing of the conditions of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory workers after receiving the challenge letter from the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory, as well as their reply agreeing to launch the competition; and published a commentary. In the short commentary "We Must Do This Competition Well", the newspaper pointed out: Through this competition, we must break conservative ideas, eliminate the resistance that hinders the progress of the masses, and tap the potential power hidden in the working masses and put it into the competition. The short commentary also emphasized: The mutual competition between two factories in different regions is a new beginning in Xi'an. Therefore, it is even more necessary to carry out this competition and achieve results and experience. Mi Qinghua, a labor model in Xi'an City and head of the administrative group of the first workshop of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, who had visited the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory and exchanged production experience, also wrote an article in the Xi'an Daily entitled "I Will Use Practical Actions to Do This Competition Well". He said: This competition has added strength to the "genuine goods" movement that is being carried out in the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. He said that he would further improve his technical level in this competition and improve production from the current basis. The two newspapers also reported on the progress of the competition between the two factories, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor and their confidence in victory. For example, the workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory once stopped learning the "caustic soda boiling blank method" created by the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory due to equipment problems. After seeing the news reprinted in the newspaper about the successful imitation of the bottom powder of their factory by the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory, they successfully learned it in two days. The Xi'an Daily reprinted the Shijiazhuang Daily's report that the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory completed the production task for the first ten days of March one day ahead of schedule, and the product quality was even higher than the competition conditions, which encouraged the workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory to complete the competition's determination, and each workshop team actively worked hard for their guarantee conditions. Now the inter-factory competition between the two factories is in full swing. The Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory is actively preparing to carry out a small-scale mechanization campaign, and has decided to change the manual production of the enamel furnace to semi-mechanized "straight-line enamel rotary furnace" production; the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory has successfully transformed the enamel furnace and is actively carrying out research and experimental work on the loop mechanical continuous kiln. And the newspapers in the two places are also promoting the exchange of advanced experience between factories in the two regions through their own propaganda and organizational role, along with the development of the labor competition between the two factories.
    The inter-factory competition proposed and organized by the Xi'an Daily and the Shijiazhuang Daily provides a good example for newspapers in learning from the advanced experience of Soviet newspapers and further connecting with reality and the masses. However, this competition is not just a matter between two factories, it has also attracted great attention from the workers and masses in other factories in the two regions. The Xi'an Textile Factory once asked the Xi'an Daily to help organize an inter-factory competition between them and the Xianyang State-owned Cotton Textile Factory. Therefore, in the future, continuing to expand the impact of this competition and reporting on the reactions of various production departments to this competition should be an issue worthy of attention by newspapers.

### 报纸倡议的厂际劳动竞赛

    报纸倡议的厂际劳动竞赛
    西安日报在学习苏联地方报纸经济宣传的经验后，向石家庄日报建议，由两报共同提议和组织了西安人民搪瓷厂和石家庄搪瓷厂的厂际竞赛。
    这两个报纸所提议和组织的竞赛，是在两厂职工建立了深厚友情的基础上，有计划、有准备地开展起来的。西安日报在报道发起竞赛的经过时说：西安人民搪瓷厂和石家庄搪瓷厂是两个新建的地方国营企业，过去产品质量不高。石家庄搪瓷厂经过去年的增产节约竞赛，改进工作方法，实行计划管理，产品的产量和质量比过去有了显著的进步。西安人民搪瓷厂曾派人去石家庄搪瓷厂学习“火碱煮坯法”，交流经验，研究提高质量的办法。而石家庄搪瓷厂，也在采纳了西安人民搪瓷厂的先进经验和他们的建议后，提高了奶黄色素的质量，改进了口杯边不平正的毛病。两厂职工在这些交流经验的活动和彼此间的信件往来中，互相得到了很大的鼓舞。西安日报为了进一步推动两厂职工提高生产改进产品的质量，就写信给石家庄日报，由两报共同提议组织了这次为期两月、以生产优良产品为主要内容的厂际竞赛。
    一个多月来，西安日报通过自己的报道，宣传和推动了竞赛的开展。三月十三日该报在一版的显著地位，发表了西安人民搪瓷厂的职工接到石家庄搪瓷厂的挑战书后，热烈酝酿应战条件的通讯报道和照片，以及他们同意展开竞赛的复信；并发表了评论。该报在“一定要把这次竞赛搞好”的短评中指出：必须通过这次竞赛，打破保守思想，消除束缚群众前进的阻力，把蕴藏在工人群众中的潜在力量发掘出来，投入竞赛中去。短评又着重说明：不同地区两个工厂相互展开竞赛，在西安是一个新的开端。因此更必须把这次竞赛开展起来，取得成绩和经验。曾去石家庄搪瓷厂参观和交流过生产经验的西安市劳动模范、西安人民搪瓷厂第一车间行政组长米清华，也在西安日报上写了“我要用实际行动把这次竞赛搞好”的文章。他说：这次竞赛给西安人民搪瓷厂正在开展中的“正货”运动增加了力量。他表示要在这次竞赛中更加提高技术水平，把生产从现在的基础上提高一步。两报还报道了两厂竞赛进展的情况，这些都大大鼓舞了职工的劳动热情和胜利信心。例如，西安人民搪瓷厂职工一度因设备问题停止了对石家庄搪瓷厂创造的“火碱煮坯法”的学习，这次看到报上转载石家庄日报关于石家庄搪瓷厂仿制他们工厂底粉成功的消息后，在两天中一股劲学习成功了。西安日报转载了石家庄日报报道的石家庄搪瓷厂提前一天完成三月上旬的生产任务、产品质量比竞赛条件还高的消息，就鼓舞了西安人民搪瓷厂职工完成竞赛的决心，各车间小组都为自己的保证条件积极努力。现在两厂厂际竞赛正紧张进行中。石家庄搪瓷厂正在积极准备开展小型机械化运动，决定要把搪瓷炉的手工生产，改为半机械化的“直线型搪瓷转炉”生产；西安人民搪瓷厂改造搪瓷烧炉成功，正积极进行回型机械连续窑的研究试验工作。而两地的报纸，也正随着两厂劳动竞赛的开展，通过自己的宣传和组织的作用，促进两个地区的工厂间先进经验的交流。
    西安日报和石家庄日报提议组织的这次厂际竞赛，为报纸在学习苏联报纸先进经验和进一步联系实际联系群众方面，提供了一个较好的例子。但是，这次竞赛决不仅仅是两个工厂之间的事情，它还引起两个地区其他工厂中职工群众们的极大的注意。西安纺织厂就曾要求西安日报协助组织他们与咸阳国营棉纺织厂之间的厂际竞赛。因此在今后，继续扩大这一竞赛的影响，报道各个生产部门对这次竞赛的反映，应是报纸值得注意的问题。
