Wendeng Special District, Shandong Province, has achieved initial success in addressing the production difficulties of labor-short households during spring plowing.

In Wendeng Special District, 77% of farmers have been organized. A significant portion of the farmers who have not joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations are households lacking labor. While the production and living standards of general farmers have rapidly improved in recent years, these struggling households have largely remained at their previous levels, with per-mu yields about 100 jin lower than those of general farmers, leading to more production difficulties. In response to this situation, the Wendeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, drawing on the experience of Kunyu Third District in addressing the production problems of struggling households last year, instructed all localities to effectively assist labor-short households in resolving their production difficulties during spring plowing. Some areas even calculated that if the yield of these households could be raised to the level of the general masses, overall production would increase by about 2% compared to last year.

Currently, some areas of Wendeng Special District have basically resolved the problem of struggling households. According to statistics from only four townships—Zhongcun Township in Haiyang, Menlou Township in Fushan, Lijiazhuang in Wendeng, and Tengjiazhuang in Rushan—out of 1,810 farming households, 162 are struggling households. Forty-three of these struggling households have now joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, sixty households have contracted their land to surrounding masses for cultivation at reasonable prices, thirty households have resolved their issues through mutual assistance among relatives and neighbors, and the remaining twenty-plus households have been resolved through methods such as renting out land and dividing land for cultivation. The struggling households are in high spirits and actively engaged in production. Ding Xiuzhen, a labor-short household in Tengjiazhuang Township, has finished plowing her peanut fields after joining a group, and has dismantled a heated brick bed to get an additional two cartloads of manure per mu. Zhou Xiangsheng, a sixteen-year-old orphan, used to be idle all day long, but since joining the mutual aid group, he has been working very energetically. He has three mu of drainage ditches that had never been dug before, but now they have all been dug.

    山东省文登专区在春耕生产中
    初步解决了缺乏劳力农户的困难
    山东省文登专区在春耕生产中注意解决缺劳力的困难户的生产困难，已获得初步成绩。
    文登专区组织起来的农户已达总农户百分之七十七，未参加互助合作组织的农户中有很大一部分是无劳力户，一般农户的生产和生活几年来都迅速上升，这些困难户大都还停止在旧有水平上，每亩田的产量比一般农户要低一百斤左右，所以，生产中困难较多。中共文登地委针对这一情况，并根据昆嵛三区去年解决困难户生产问题的经验，指示各地在春耕生产中要很好地帮助无劳力户解决生产中的困难。有的地方并计算了一下，如果能把这些户的产量提高到一般群众的水平，就能比去年全面增产百分之二左右。
    目前文登专区已有部分地区基本上解决了困难户的问题。仅据海阳中村乡、福山门楼乡、文登李家庄和乳山腾甲庄四个乡的统计，一千八百一十户农民中共有困难户一百六十二户，现在这些困难户已有四十三户参加互助合作组织，六十户用合理价格把土地包给周围群众代种，通过亲邻相帮的方法解决的有三十户，其余二十多户采用出租和分种等办法也都得到解决。困难户情绪饱满，生产积极。腾甲庄乡无劳力户丁秀贞入组后，花生地已耕完，并拆了一铺炕，每亩地能多上两车粪。十六岁的孤儿周相生，过去整天不知干活，自从参加互助组后，干活很起劲，他有三亩地的水沟，过去从未挖过，现在已经全挖了。
