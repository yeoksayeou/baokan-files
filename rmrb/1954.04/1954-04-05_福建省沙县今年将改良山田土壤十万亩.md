    Sha County, Fujian Province, plans to improve 100,000 mu of mountain paddy soil this year, of which 60,000 mu were initially improved last year and will continue to be improved this year. In this way, 55 percent of the county's 180,000 mu of thin and barren mountain paddy fields will gradually become fertile. It is estimated that the county will increase its rice production by at least 2.7 million jin this year as a result.
    Last year, the Sha County Party and government leading organs summarized and promoted the farmers' experience in increasing production, and mobilized the farmers to adopt a series of improved farming techniques such as improving soil, appropriately close planting, and selecting fine varieties. As a result, the county's rice harvest was still abundant despite the drought that had not been seen in thirty years, with an average increase of 9 percent. In particular, the increase in production was even more significant in mountain paddy fields that had been improved. Local farmers used tender leaves and weeds from the mountains, stems and leaves of leguminous plants, and bamboo shoot heads and shells, turning them into the soil to decompose, or changed their past habits and adopted the method of "not burning rice straw, cow dung, or garbage," directly burying them in the fields. More than 60,000 mu of mountain paddy fields increased organic matter, with production increasing by 10 to 20 percent. Last year, Eight Street and Mao Ping townships improved 763 mu of mountain paddy fields, with an average increase of more than 20 percent. Zhang Wangzhi, a labor model in Eight Street, improved 10.5 mu of soil last spring, increasing production by more than 30 percent, yielding 94 jin more grain per mu.
    This year, the county organized more than ten cadres to specifically summarize the experience and lessons learned from improving technology last year, and held discussions with agricultural labor models, further affirming that widely opening up fertilizer sources and increasing organic fertilizer application is the main key to improving mountain paddy soil quality and increasing yields. At the same time, applying this kind of fertilizer is a simple and easy way to increase production with very low costs. Based on these situations, the Sha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a preliminary plan for improving agricultural technology with soil improvement as the main focus, and decided to improve 100,000 mu of soil throughout the county this year.
    At the agricultural production increase model representative meeting held in the county in mid-March, the experience of soil improvement was emphatically summarized and exchanged. Each district will also hold technical training courses to promote advanced farming experience such as soil improvement.

    福建省沙县今年将改良山田土壤十万亩
    福建省沙县计划今年改良山田土壤十万亩，其中六万亩去年已初步改良，今年将继续改良。这样，全县十八万亩瘦瘠的山田中就有百分之五十五能逐步变得肥沃，估计全县今年因此至少能够增产二百七十多万斤稻谷。
    去年，沙县党政领导机关总结推广农民的增产经验，发动农民采用改良土壤、适当密植、选用良种等一系列改进耕作技术的办法，使全县水稻虽在三十年来未有的旱灾侵袭下，仍然得到丰收，平均增产百分之九。特别是经过改良土壤的山田增产成绩更加显著。当地农民用山野间的嫩叶杂草、豆科植物的秆叶、笋头笋壳翻入土中使其腐烂，或改变过去习惯，采用“稻草、牛粪、垃圾三不烧”，直接埋入田中等办法，使六万多亩山田增加了有机质，都增产一成到二成。八街、茅坪两乡去年改良山田七百六十三亩，平均增产两成多。八街劳动模范张旺治去年春季改良土壤十亩三分半，增产三成多，每亩多收九十四斤谷。
    该县今年曾组织干部十余人，专门总结了去年改进技术的经验教训，并和农业劳动模范作了座谈讨论，进一步肯定了广泛开辟肥源增施有机质肥料是改良山田土质提高产量的主要关键。同时，增施这种肥料是简便易行而且成本很低的增产办法。根据这些情况，中共沙县县委制订了以改良土壤为主的改进农业技术的初步方案，决定今年全县改良土壤十万亩。
    在三月中旬县里召开的农业增产模范代表会上，着重总结交流了改良土壤的经验。各区也将先后举办技术训练班，推广改良土壤等先进耕作经验。
