The Grain Bureau of Jiangxi Provincial People's Government is actively carrying out grain centralization and transportation work, and has now completed 75% of the task of centralizing and transporting dispersed grain.

The grain unified purchase work in Jiangxi Province ended in early January, but due to insufficient warehouse capacity in some areas, some grain could not be put into storage and was stored in a decentralized manner. This extremely dispersed phenomenon of every village having warehouses and every household having grain not only made storage difficult and scheduling inflexible, but also affected planned supply. In response to this situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Bureau immediately focused on the centralized transportation and rectification of dispersed grain. In mid-January, it held an emergency meeting of personnel from grain bureaus of various special districts and counties, key counties, and key warehouses, and made specific arrangements. Subsequently, centralized transportation work was launched throughout the province. At present, 75% of the province's grain centralization and transportation tasks have been completed, of which eight counties have completed all tasks, and twenty-seven counties are close to completion.

Before the centralized transportation, various localities also carried out specific organizational mobilization work, organized and grouped people by township to transport grain collectively, handed over and allocated grain collectively, and established systems such as receipt and dispatch procedures. For example, Wuning and other counties inspected bridges, roads, ferry crossings, and ships that were in disrepair along the way before the centralized transportation of grain, and set up tea stations to solve the food and accommodation problems of the masses. Some counties also dispatched doctors to provide services for sick grain-transporting laborers. In areas with insufficient labor, they transferred laborers from neighboring districts and counties to help. Yiyang County transferred hundreds of laborers from Guangfeng County and Yugan County, and Yihuang County transferred hundreds of handcarts from Linchuan County and Chongren County to participate in the centralized transportation. Some counties, such as Yongfeng County, adopted segmented relay transportation to speed up the process. In areas lacking tools, the shipping department carried out unified allocation of boats and rafts to accelerate turnover and give full play to the role of transportation tools. In Nancheng Shihuangg and Poyu and other places, which have historically relied on manual transportation, raft transportation was used this year, completing the task ahead of schedule and saving more than 30 million yuan in transportation costs.

    江西省集运粮食加强保管工作
    江西省人民政府粮食厅，积极进行粮食集运工作，现已完成分散粮食集运任务的百分之七十五。
    江西省粮食统购工作在一月初结束，但由于某些地区仓容不足，有些粮食未能入库而分散存放。这样村村有仓、户户有粮的极端分散现象，不仅保管困难，调度不灵，而且影响计划供应。针对这一情况，江西省粮食厅，立即抓紧了分散粮的集运和整顿工作，在一月中旬，召开了各专区、县粮食局、重点县、重点仓库人员紧急会议，进行了具体布置。接着，各地普遍展开集运工作。目前，全省粮食集运任务，已完成百分之七十五，其中有八个县已全部完成，二十七个县接近完成。
    在集运前，各地还进行了具体的组织动员工作，分乡编队编组集体运送，集体交拨和建立了收发手续等制度。如武宁等县在粮食集运前，检查了沿途失修的桥梁、道路渡口、船只，并设立茶水站等，解决群众的食宿问题。有的县还调派医生，准备为生病的运粮民工服务。对劳动力不足的地区，调拨邻区邻县民工帮助。弋阳县从广丰县，余干县调拨了数百个民工，宜黄县到临川县，崇仁县调拨了几百部手车参加集运。有的县如永丰县采取了分段接力运输，加快了速度；对工具缺乏地区，通过航运部门进行了船筏统一调配，加速了周转，充分发挥了运输工具的作用，南城石璜、珀玗等地，历年都是人力运输，今年改用筏运，提前完成了任务，而且节约了运费三千余万元。
