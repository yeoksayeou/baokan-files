    Harbin Municipal People's Representatives Closely Contact Constituents
    Shanghai Many Factory People's Representatives Actively Contact the Masses to Find Ways to Improve Production
    Harbin's district people's representatives have established various systems and methods for contacting constituents. After the grassroots elections in the city's seven districts, the newly elected 1,198 people's representatives formed people's representative groups according to the different characteristics of factories, institutions, enterprises, and street electoral districts, and held regular group meetings or joint meetings of people's representatives and government cadres. At these meetings, the people's representatives specifically studied and handled the constituents' proposals, listened to government cadres report on the current central work, and, based on the specific conditions of each electoral district, determined further activity plans for the people's representatives to contact the constituents. The meetings also organized the people's representatives to study government policies and decrees and exchange good experiences in contacting constituents. The Nangang District People's Representative Group studied the grain planned supply policy when discussing the constituents' proposals. Some people's representative groups discussed the issue of mobilizing farmers who blindly flowed into the city to return to their hometowns to engage in production, based on the central work of the district people's government. The Taiping District People's Representative Group also organized the people's representatives to study the typical experiences of people's representatives contacting constituents, as introduced in the "People's Representative Activity Bulletin" published by the district people's government.
    The people's representatives in various districts also continuously created new methods for contacting constituents. In order to facilitate frequent contact with constituents and accept and handle constituents' proposals, the people's representatives of the Cement Factory, together with the people's supervision correspondents, established a proposal review office. Recently, based on the suggestions in the workers' proposals, the factory established a four-prevention inspection team and conducted a major spring safety inspection. People's representatives in institutions, enterprises, and schools, due to busy work schedules, find it difficult to meet with constituents frequently, so they created forms of contacting constituents such as holiday visits, people's representative activity days, proposal boxes, suggestion books, and forums, to collect constituents' proposals and answer questions about the handling of constituents' proposals. Through the discussion of the "Proposal Forum," the people's representatives of the Harbin Tram Company educated the tram attendants to change their cold and impatient attitude towards passengers. People's representatives in the streets mainly take the form of participating in street cadre meetings, resident group meetings, forums, and visits to contact constituents. Due to the active activities of the people's representatives, the broad masses of constituents are very concerned about state affairs. The proposals submitted by all constituents in Nangang District in two months increased nine times compared to the proposals received at the last People's Representative Conference, which played a great role in improving the work of government agencies and spurring cadres to work more actively. For example, based on the constituents' proposals, the people's representatives of Guxiang District urged the health section of the district people's government to form a joint health inspection team and promoted spring sanitation work through commendation and criticism.
    Among the more than 4,600 district people's representatives elected in the grassroots elections in Shanghai, more than 37 percent are workers in various industrial production departments. After being elected, these people's representatives actively contacted the masses and promoted the production of many departments. In Putuo District, where factories are relatively concentrated, eighty district people's representatives working in factories held many forums and studied with the workers how to improve production. Zhou Afeng, a model worker of Shanghai First State-owned Cotton Mill and assistant of the preparation department, who once created the fine yarn reverse joint method, collected workers' opinions on production in the workshop every day after being elected as a people's representative. When he learned about particularly poor skills and the pursuit of quantity over quality, he patiently helped correct them. Usually, when he discovered some problems in production or workers' thinking, he would take the opportunity of the workshop's "lane meetings" to solve them, thereby strengthening the connection with the groups in the four workshops. Shanghai Xin Yu Yarn Factory, which recently implemented joint state-private ownership, carried out a locomotive blitz repair to improve production efficiency and change labor organization. During the repair, many maintenance technicians were not accustomed to using advanced repair methods, were afraid of trouble, and thought that it could not be repaired well without stopping the machine. Zhu Rongquan, the factory's people's representative, helped everyone calculate the production account, explained the reason why fixed parking repair hindered production in the past, and repeatedly persuaded technicians Zhu Yongchun, Wang Asi, etc. to change their old habits of decades, giving play to everyone's enthusiasm, and repaired more than 30 locomotives in more than 20 days, reducing working hours by more than 50% compared to the past.
    In February this year, many citizens wrote letters to the Shanghai State-owned Bulb Factory, raising the opinion that some bulbs had broken filaments. Zhu Guanbao, director of the factory's large bulb workshop and district people's representative, organized a quality research group with the factory's engineers and technicians based on these opinions and found the cause of the broken filaments. They conducted inspections on technical operations and specifications in the entire workshop, strengthened technical guidance, and consequently reduced the bulb breakage rate from 1.2 percent to 0.5 percent within a month. After accepting the opinions raised by workers from relevant factories that the factory's high-quality steel ingots had "subcutaneous pinholes," Pan Desheng, director of the smelting workshop of the State-owned Asia Steel Factory and district people's representative, led 18 production groups and many people to study and learn advanced Soviet technology, so that 99 percent of the products reached the qualified standard.

    哈尔滨市各区人民代表密切联系选民
    上海很多工厂的人民代表积极联系群众设法改进生产
    哈尔滨市各区人民代表建立了各种联系选民的制度和方法。市内七个区在基层选举结束后，新当选的一千一百九十八名人民代表，就按工厂、机关、企业和街道各选区的不同特点，成立了人民代表小组，定期召开小组会议或人民代表和政府干部的联席会议。在这些会议上，人民代表具体研究和处理选民的提案，听取政府干部报告当前中心工作的情况，并根据各选区具体情况，确定人民代表进一步联系选民的活动计划。会上还组织人民代表学习政府政策法令，交流联系选民的好经验。南岗区人民代表小组在讨论选民提案时，学习了粮食计划供应政策。有些人民代表小组根据区人民政府的中心工作，讨论了动员盲目流入城市的农民回乡生产的问题。太平区人民代表小组还组织人民代表学习了区人民政府刊印的“人民代表活动通报”上所介绍的人民代表联系选民的典型经验。
    各区人民代表还不断创造出联系选民的新的方法。水泥厂人民代表为了便于经常和选民联系，接受和处理选民的提案，和人民监察通讯员一起，成立了提案审查室。最近，该厂根据职工们在提案中的建议，成立了四防检查小组，进行了春季保安大检查。在机关、企业和学校里的人民代表，由于工作繁忙很难经常和选民见面，因此就创立了假日访问、人民代表活动日、提案箱、留言簿和座谈会等联系选民的形式，搜集选民提案和解答选民提案的处理情况。哈尔滨电车公司人民代表通过“提案座谈会”的讨论，教育电车乘务人员改变了对待乘客态度冷淡、不耐烦的工作作风。街道中的人民代表，主要是采取参加街道干部会、居民组大会、座谈会和访问等形式去联系选民。由于人民代表的积极活动，广大选民非常关心国家事务。南岗区全体选民在两个月中提出的提案较上次人民代表会议收到的提案增加九倍，这些提案对提高政府机关工作和鞭策干部更加积极工作都起了很大作用。如顾乡区人民代表根据选民的提案，督促区人民政府卫生科组成卫生联合检查组，并用表扬与批评的办法，推动了春季卫生工作。
    上海市在基层选举中选出的四千六百多个区人民代表中，有百分之三十七以上是各工业生产部门的工人。这些人民代表被选出以后，都积极联系群众，推动了许多部门的生产。在工厂相当集中的普陀区，有八十个在工厂工作的区人民代表，他们召开过很多座谈会，和工人一道研究如何改进生产。曾经创造细纱反接头法的市劳动模范、国营上海第一棉纺织厂准备部助理员周阿凤，在当选为人民代表后，每天都在车间里征集工人对生产的意见。他了解到技术特别差和求量不求质的情况时，便耐心帮助纠正。平时他发现生产或工人思想上的一些问题时，就利用车间开“弄堂会”的机会加以解决，因而加强了和四个车间的小组的联系。新近实行公私合营的上海市新裕纱厂，为了提高生产效率，改变劳动组织，曾进行了一次机车突击检修。检修中，许多保全技工对采用先进的检修方法不习惯，怕麻烦，认为不停车修不好。该厂人民代表朱荣泉就帮助大家计算生产账，说明过去固定停车检修妨害生产的道理，反复说服技工朱永春、王阿四等改变了几十年来的旧习惯，发挥了大家的积极性，在二十多天内修好了三十多部机车，较过去减少工时百分之五十以上。
    今年二月间，许多市民写信给国营上海灯泡厂，提出有部分灯泡断丝的意见。该厂大灯车间主任、区人民代表朱观保根据这些意见和该厂工程师、技工等组织了质量研究小组，找出断丝的原因，在全车间的技术操作上和规格上进行了检查，加强了技术指导，因而在一个月内使灯泡断丝率由百分之一点二降低到百分之零点五。国营亚细亚钢铁厂冶炼车间主任、区人民代表潘得生，在接受有关工厂工人提出该厂优质钢锭有“皮下小气孔”的意见后，就带动十八个生产小组，和许多人研究学习了苏联的先进技术，使产品百分之九十九达到合格标准。
