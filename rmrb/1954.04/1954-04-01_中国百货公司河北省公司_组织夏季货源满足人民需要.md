China Department Store Hebei Provincial Company

Organizes Summer Goods Supply to Meet People's Needs

The China Department Store Hebei Provincial Company, as early as February, based on the supply of summer goods last year and the need for increased purchasing power of urban and rural people this year, made a business plan for summer goods. Currently, summer goods such as sleeping mats, umbrellas, DDT, fans, mosquito netting cloth, sock covers, and white canvas shoes have been listed as the main part of the purchase, and these summer goods have generally been expanded by about three times compared to last year. The purchase of rain (rubber) shoes in the second quarter is approximately equal to the total sales volume of last year. Accepting the lesson of the out-of-stock umbrellas last year, the purchase of umbrellas has been appropriately expanded in this year's summer goods plan, and pillow mats, straw hats, bamboo curtains, etc., which were not commonly operated last year, will also be managed.

Now, the company has sent special personnel to major cities or production areas to actively organize procurement. The goods successively transferred in March can reach 30% of the total purchase plan for the summer, and the remaining goods will be purchased in large quantities in April according to seasonal needs to ensure timely supply.

    中国百货公司河北省公司
    组织夏季货源满足人民需要
    中国百货公司河北省公司，早在二月份就根据去年夏季商品的供应情况，和今年城乡人民购买力增长的需要，作出了夏季商品的经营计划。目前已将凉席、雨伞、滴滴涕、扇子、蚊帐布、袜套、白力士鞋等夏季商品列入进货的主要部分，这些夏令商品一般都较去年扩大了三倍左右。第二季度进货的雨（胶）鞋约等于去年全年的销售量。接受去年雨伞脱销的教训，在今年的夏季商品计划中适当地扩大了雨伞的进货，并将经营去年没有普遍经营的枕席、草帽、竹帘等。
    现在该公司已派专人前往大城市或产地积极组织采购，在三月陆续调进的商品可达夏季全部进货计划的百分之三十，其余商品则按季节需要在四月份大量进货，以保证及时供应。
