    Nationwide Movement in Japan Protests American Hydrogen Bomb Tests

    At four o'clock in the morning on March 1st, the Japanese fishing boat "Lucky Dragon No. 5" was fishing in the Pacific Ocean, 19 nautical miles outside the exclusion zone for American hydrogen bomb tests, when it was suddenly harmed by the American hydrogen bomb test. Four or five days later, the crew members began to develop various symptoms. On March 13th, the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" returned to the port of Yaizu in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, and the severely injured people's hair had already begun to fall out. After the twenty-three crew members brought the fish ashore, they were all hospitalized for treatment.

    The Japanese people suffered the third disaster from American atomic weapons. This incident immediately aroused the outrage of all sectors of Japanese society.

    After the incident, instead of stopping hydrogen bomb tests and compensating the Japanese people for their losses, the United States notified Japan on March 19th that it was expanding the exclusion zone for hydrogen bomb tests several times over, and on March 26th, it conducted another hydrogen bomb explosion test. At the same time, the United States, under the pretext of having American medical institutions treat the injured, attempted to forcibly take the affected Japanese crew members to use as experimental subjects for American hydrogen bomb research. The United States also demanded that Japan sail the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" fishing boat to the Yokosuka U.S. military base for American research. This tyrannical behavior of the United States, treating the Pacific high seas as its own inner lake and the Japanese people as guinea pigs for hydrogen bomb tests, further angered all sectors of Japanese society.

    The people and fishery organizations in various fishing ports in Japan were the first to protest the American atrocities of harming Japanese fishermen by testing hydrogen bombs, demanding compensation for losses and demanding a ban on the use and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The day after the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" incident news was published—March 17th—the Yaizu City Council convened an emergency meeting and jointly formed the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" Incident Countermeasures Headquarters with the "Yaizu Fisheries Cooperative Association" to launch activities. On the same day, at the strong request of the fishermen, the governor of Shizuoka Prefecture issued a protest to the United States. The Shizuoka Prefectural Council of Trade Unions and the Shizuoka Prefectural Assembly both lodged serious protests with the United States. The Misaki Town Council in Kanagawa Prefecture and the Shiogama City and Ishinomaki City Councils in Miyagi Prefecture also passed resolutions calling for a ban on atomic weapons.

    The protest movement spread rapidly. On March 19th, the Japan National Relief Association, the Japan Federation of Democratic Medical Institutions, and the New Japan Medical Association sent a joint investigation team to Yaizu Port to visit the hospitalized crew members of the "Lucky Dragon No. 5", report the investigation situation to the people of the whole country, and launch people's relief activities. On March 20th, the Japan Peace Protection Committee invited representatives from a wide range of sectors to hold a forum on the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" incident, and decided: (1) to launch a nationwide movement to demand a ban on atomic weapons; (2) to demand that the United States compensate for the direct and indirect losses of this incident; (3) to demand that all members of the Diet pass a resolution banning atomic weapons in the current Diet session; (4) to carry out a large-scale signature campaign to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs; (5) to demand that the government propose to the United States to stop conducting hydrogen bomb tests on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean; (6) to appeal to world public opinion to demand the disclosure of the secrets of atomic weapons and guarantee the freedom of fishing on the high seas; (7) to submit the demand to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs to the Geneva Conference to be held on April 26th, and to submit this demand to the World People's Peace Conference; (8) to oppose the U.S. government's conspiracy to take the victims away under the pretext of U.S. treatment of the injured, in reality to use them as experimental subjects, and to firmly advocate that Japanese doctors conduct treatment; and to request medical scientists and scientists from all countries to send investigation teams to Japan to investigate. On March 22nd, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference invited representatives from many trade unions, peace organizations, fishermen, and chambers of commerce to hold a meeting, listen to the report of the investigation team of the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" incident dispatched by the committee, and decided to fully support and promote the movement policy of the Japan Peace Protection Committee.

    Kasuga Shoichi, Chairman of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on March 17th, sternly condemning the damage caused to the Japanese people by American atomic weapon tests, and pointed out: "We understand the great significance of the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the use of atomic weapons, and we must fight together with the people of the whole country to stop such tests." The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than three million members, held a meeting on March 22nd and decided to protest to the United States, launch a movement in Japan for the Japanese people to demand a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs, and issued an appeal to trade unions, peace organizations, and academic organizations around the world, hoping that trade unions and peace and academic organizations in various countries would appeal to their own people and demand that their own governments ban the manufacture of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and demand that this issue be listed as an important topic of the Geneva Conference.

    Representatives of women's organizations across Japan gathered in Tokyo on April 6th and unanimously passed a resolution calling for a ban on atomic weapons. Japanese youth and students collected signatures on the streets of Tokyo demanding compensation from the United States for the losses of the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" incident and demanding the convening of an international conference to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Every day, crowds of people enthusiastically responded by signing. At the fourth spring conference of the Human Rights Protection Committee of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations held on March 27th, an emergency motion was passed stating: "The Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb incident is an infringement on the right to human survival and an affront to human culture, and therefore the use of atomic weapons must be prohibited." The Atomic Nucleus Special Committee of the Science Council of Japan issued a statement at a meeting held in Tokyo on April 4th, saying: Standing from the standpoint of humanitarianism and researchers, we firmly demand a ban on atomic weapons.

    Under the pressure of the people's protest movement, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet also passed resolutions on April 1st and 5th respectively, demanding that the United Nations take appropriate measures as soon as possible to ban atomic weapons.

    However, after the United States tested hydrogen bombs and harmed Japanese fishermen, the Yoshida government has not taken appropriate and reasonable measures in response to the protests and demands of the vast number of Japanese people against the United States. On March 25th, Yoshida government Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki shamelessly said at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives of the Diet, in response to questioning from Diet members: "I will try my best to assist and not hinder the hydrogen bomb tests of the United States." This fully exposes the traitorous nature of the Yoshida government, which disregards national security and blindly serves as a tool for the American policy of aggression.

    Currently, the protest movement of the Japanese people is continuing to spread like wildfire throughout Japan. The editorial of the "Red Flag" newspaper, the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party, on March 30th pointed out: The Japanese people's movement to demand a ban on atomic weapons is the patriotic struggle of the Japanese people to defend national security, peace, and independence.

### 日本全国抗议美国试验氢弹的运动

    日本全国抗议美国试验氢弹的运动
    三月一日清晨四时，日本福龙丸渔船在离开美国试验氢弹禁止航行区域外缘十九浬的太平洋公海上捕鱼时，突然受到美国试验氢弹的伤害。四、五天后，船员们身上就先后开始发生种种病态。三月十三日福龙丸返抵日本静冈县的烧津港，受重伤的人头发已经开始脱落。二十三名船员把鱼运上岸后，全体入医院治疗。
    日本人民受到了美国原子武器的第三次灾害。这一事件立即引起了日本各阶层人民的震怒。
    事件发生后，美国非但没有停止氢弹试验并赔偿日本人民的损失，反而在三月十九日通知日本把试验氢弹的禁区扩大了数倍，并且在三月二十六日又进行了氢弹爆炸试验。同时，美国还借口由美国医疗机关治疗伤者而企图把受害的日本船员强夺过去充当美国研究氢弹的实验品。美国并且向日本要求把福龙丸渔船开到横须贺美军基地以供美国研究。美国这种把太平洋公海当作自己的内湖，把日本人民视作试验氢弹的豚鼠的横暴行为，更加激怒了日本各阶层人民。
    日本各渔港的人民及渔业团体首先起来抗议美国试验氢弹伤害日本渔民的暴行，要求美国赔偿损失，要求禁止使用和试验原子弹氢弹。福龙丸事件新闻发表的第二天——三月十七日，烧津市议会就召开了紧急会议，并和“烧津渔业协同组合”共同组成了福龙丸事件对策本部展开活动。同一天，在渔民的强烈要求下，静冈县县长发表了对美国的抗议。静冈县工会评议会和静冈县议会都向美国提出严重抗议。神奈川县的三崎町议会和宫城县的盐灶市、石卷市议会也都通过了要求禁止原子武器的决议。
    抗议运动迅速扩展起来。日本国民救援会、日本民主医疗机构联合会、新日本医师协会三个团体，在三月十九日派出联合调查团到烧津港访问住院医治的福龙丸船员，向全国人民报道调查情况，展开了人民的救济活动。日本拥护和平委员会在三月二十日邀请广泛阶层代表举行福龙丸事件恳谈会，决定：（一）在全国范围内展开要求禁止原子武器的运动；（二）要求美国赔偿这次事件的直接和间接损失；（三）要求全体国会议员在本届国会中通过禁止原子武器的决议；（四）开展征集禁止原子弹氢弹的签名大运动；（五）要求政府向美国提出停止在太平洋公海继续举行氢弹试验；（六）呼吁世界舆论要求公开原子武器的秘密和保证公海捕鱼的自由；（七）向四月二十六日举行的日内瓦会议提出禁止原子弹氢弹的要求，并向世界人民和平大会提出这项要求；（八）反对美国政府借口由美国治疗伤者而实际是要把受害者夺去充作实验品的阴谋，坚决主张由日本医师进行治疗；并要求世界各国的医学家、科学家派调查团来日本调查。三月二十二日，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本和平联络会邀请许多工会、和平团体、渔民、商会的代表举行会议，听取该会派遣的福龙丸事件调查团的报告，决定全面支持和推进日本拥护和平委员会的运动方针。
    日本共产党中央指导部主席春日正一在三月十七日发表谈话，严正指责美国原子武器试验对日本人民的伤害，指出：“我们理解苏联提出禁止使用原子武器建议的重大意义，一定要和全国人民一道为制止这种试验而奋斗。”拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会，三月二十二日召开会议，决定向美国提出抗议，在国内开展日本人民要求禁止原子弹氢弹的运动，并发表致世界各国的工会、和平团体、学术团体的呼吁书，希望各国的工会及和平、学术团体向本国人民呼吁及向本国政府要求禁止制造原子弹氢弹，并且要求把这个问题列为日内瓦会议的重要议题。
    日本全国妇女团体的代表，四月六日在东京集会，一致通过了要求禁止原子武器的决议。日本青年学生，在东京街头征集要求美国赔偿福龙丸事件损失和要求召开禁止原子弹氢弹国际会议的签名。每天，成群的人们热烈响应签名。日本律师会联合会三月二十七日举行的第四次保卫人权委员会春季大会上，通过紧急动议说：“比基尼岛的氢弹事件是对人类生存权利的侵害，是对人类文化的冒渎，因而必须禁止使用原子武器。”日本学术会议四月四日在东京举行的原子核特别委员会会议上发表声明说：我们站在人道主义和研究工作者的立场上，坚决要求禁止原子武器。
    在人民群众抗议运动的压力下，日本国会众议院和参议院在四月一日和五日也先后通过决议，要求联合国从速采取适当措施禁止原子武器。
    可是，美国试验氢弹伤害日本渔民事件发生后，吉田政府对于日本广大人民对美国的抗议和要求，一直没有采取适当的合理措施。三月二十五日，吉田政府外务相冈崎胜男在国会众议院外务委员会上答复议员质询时，竟厚颜无耻地说：“我将尽量以协助的态度，不妨碍美国的氢弹试验。”这充分暴露了吉田政府不顾民族安全、一味顺从地充当美国侵略政策工具的卖国本质。
    目前，日本人民的抗议运动，正如燎原之火一样地在日本全国各地继续扩展。日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”三月三十日的社论指出：日本人民要求禁止原子武器运动，就是日本人民保卫民族安全、和平与独立的爱国斗争。
