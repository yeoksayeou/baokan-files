    Reply from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Supervisory Office Regarding the Handling of Embezzlement of Remittance Cases

    The Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications replied in a letter: The three cases reported by your readers regarding certain postal workers stealing remittances for the dependents of the Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army have been verified by our office as factual. The handling of each case is hereby reported as follows:

      I. Zhao Guangfu, a rural postman from the Panshan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Liaoxi, embezzled and stole nearly five million yuan in total, including one million yuan in remittances for the dependents of Comrade Ma Lianxi; and tore up seven letters (including two registered letters) addressed to Comrade Ma Lianxi. After the case was clarified in December last year, in addition to recovering and returning all the stolen money, Zhao Guangfu was arrested and brought to justice.

    II. The remittance for the dependents of Comrade Zhang Yongfeng, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, was stolen by Zhu Junzhi, a mailman from the Zunhua Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei. This case was handled in December last year. In addition to recovering the stolen money and returning it in full to Comrade Zhang's family, Zhu Junzhi was given an administrative demerit.

    III. Quan Bangqing of the Longtan Agency of the Huayuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Hunan Province was found guilty of stealing remittances for revolutionary soldiers, etc. The case was clarified in December last year, and the relevant remittances were returned to the addressees. Quan Bangqing was sentenced to imprisonment by the local People's Court.

    The supervisory institutions of the postal and telecommunications system discovered and handled many cases of embezzlement and theft of remittances last year, which shows that there are serious acts of embezzlement, theft, and violation of law and discipline among rural mail carriers and rural postal agencies. The leadership attaches importance to this situation. The recently concluded national conference of postal and telecommunications bureau directors of all provinces and cities has resolved to continue to oppose embezzlement and theft, rectify rural postal services, and clean up agency offices as one of the important tasks this year in order to eliminate embezzlement and theft and improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    邮电部监察室来信答复贪污汇款事件的处理情况
    中央人民政府邮电部监察室来信：你报读者反映的某些邮政人员盗窃志愿军、解放军赡家汇款的三个案件，经我室了解，都是确实的。今将各案处理情况函复如下：
      一，辽西盘山邮电局乡邮员赵广福一共贪污盗窃近五百万元，其中有马连喜同志赡家汇款一百万元；并撕毁了马连喜同志的七封家信（内有两封挂号）。该案于去年十二月间查清后，除将全部赃款追回退还外，并将赵广福逮捕法办。
    二，人民解放军战士张勇锋同志的赡家汇款，为河北遵化邮电局邮递员朱俊志盗窃。此案已于去年十二月处理，除将赃款追回，原数退还张同志家属外，已给予朱俊志行政上记大过处分。
    三，湖南省花垣邮电局龙潭代办所全邦清盗窃革命军人汇款等罪行，已于去年十二月间查清，相关汇款均分别退还收件人。全邦清经当地人民法院判处徒刑。
    邮电系统的监察机构在去年曾发现并处理了很多贪污盗窃汇款的案件，这说明在乡投递员、乡邮代办所中存在着严重的贪污盗窃违法乱纪的罪恶行为。领导方面对这种情况是重视的。在刚刚结束的全国各省、市邮电局长会议上已决议把继续反对贪污盗窃和整顿乡邮，清理代办所工作作为今年重要任务之一，以杜绝贪污盗窃提高邮电工作质量。
