"Red Star" published an article by M. Klimentsev entitled "The Pentagon Adventurists' 'Global' Strategy."

Klimentsev wrote: The American military newspapers are using a lot of space to discuss how future wars will be conducted. Military leaders and journalists who comment on this issue repeatedly talk about the "global" and all-encompassing nature of this new war, meaning the conquest of the entire world.

The heads of the Pentagon do not hide that the spearhead of their "global" strategy is directed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. However, the existence of the democratic and peace-loving countries is the main obstacle to the implementation of the United States' aggressive plans.

One of the most prominent features of this "global" strategy is the United States' attempt to subordinate other capitalist countries to it by organizing various military blocs, and to use these countries' armed forces and their manpower and material resources to achieve its own goals. The essence of the U.S. "global" strategy is roughly this: to use foreign troops to wage wars on foreign territories as far away from the U.S. border as possible.

One of the basic principles of the U.S. global "strategy" is to establish a series of air and naval bases. They do this for two purposes: (1) to threaten the main industrial and political centers of the democratic camp from these bases, and (2) to control the countries where these bases are located and the neighboring countries.

The American military is mainly committed to developing two types of forces that can attack over the longest distances, namely the Air Force and the Navy. In the eyes of American strategists, these two forces have another advantage, that is, relying on these two forces can use weapons of mass destruction - atomic, chemical and bacteriological weapons.

The U.S. newspapers promote the "global" strategy to make Americans believe that future wars will be fought by U.S. allies using U.S. equipment far away from the United States.

But all these calculations are unreliable. The great divisions within the imperialist camp, and the constant struggles between the major capitalist countries, make the various alliances pieced together by the United States extremely unstable. Facts show that the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to get others to wage aggressive wars for the U.S. has failed. The American intervention in Korea is proof of this.

The struggle of the people for peace and to defend their national independence is an insurmountable obstacle to the aggressive conspiracy of the American ruling group. The "global" strategists of the United States hope that new wars will be fought mainly far away from the U.S. border, and this expectation is equally unfounded. The modern warfare methods used by aggressors and those who are aggressed against have made the American continent no longer immune to damage as it used to be. Even some American leaders admit this, and they realize that the Pentagon's adventurous "global" strategy is dangerous for the United States itself.

### 五角大楼的冒险主义者的“全球”战略——苏联“红星报”评论摘要

    五角大楼的冒险主义者的“全球”战略
    ——苏联“红星报”评论摘要
    “红星报”刊载了麦·克里门采夫的一篇文章，题为“五角大楼的冒险主义者的‘全球’战略”。
    克里门采夫写道：美国的军方报纸以大量的篇幅来讨论未来的战争如何进行的问题。就这个问题发表评论的军事领袖和记者们反反复复地谈到这次新战争的“全球性”与无所不包的性质，意思也就是说征服全世界。
    五角大楼的头目们并不隐瞒他们的“全球”战略的矛头是指向苏联和各人民民主国家的。但是，民主与爱好和平国家阵营的存在，是美国要实行侵略计划时所碰到的主要障碍。
    这种“全球”战略的最突出的特点之一便是美国想通过组织各种军事集团的办法来使其他资本主义国家隶属于它，想利用这些国家的武装部队和它们的人力物力来达到自己的目的。美国“全球”战略的实质大概是这样：利用外国军队在距离美国边境尽量远的外国领土上进行战争。
    美国全球“战略”的基本原则之一便是建立一连串的空军与海军基地。他们这样做有两个目的：（一）从这些基地去威胁民主阵营主要的工业与政治中心，（二）控制这些基地所在的国家以及邻近各国。
    美国军人主要致力发展两种能到最远的距离去进攻的军队，即空军与海军。在美国的战略家们看来，这两种军队还有另一种方便，就是依靠这两种军队就能使用大规模破坏性的武器——原子、化学与细菌武器。
    美国报纸上宣传“全球”战略，是要使美国人相信：将来的战争是由美国盟友使用美国的装备在距离美国很远的地方进行的。
    但是所有这些算盘都是靠不住的。帝国主义阵营内部极大的分歧，主要资本主义国家之间不断的斗争，都使得由美国拼凑的各种联盟极不稳固。事实表明：美国帝国主义者使别人去替美国进行侵略战争的阴谋已经遭到了失败。美国在朝鲜的干涉就是一个证据。
    人民群众为争取和平与保卫本国独立的抗争是美国统治集团的侵略阴谋所无法克服的障碍。美国的“全球”战略家们指望新的战争主要是在距离美国边界很远的地方进行，这种指望也是同样没有根据的。侵略者与被侵略者所使用的现代化的战争方法，已使美洲大陆不能再像以前那样不受损害了。甚至美国的某些领袖们也承认这一点，他们认识到，五角大楼冒险的“全球”战略，对于美国本身来说是危险的。
