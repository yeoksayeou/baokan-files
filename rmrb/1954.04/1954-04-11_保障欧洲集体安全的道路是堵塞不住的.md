The Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on March 31, putting forward new proposals on the issue of guaranteeing European collective security. In the notes, the Soviet government stated that it approved of the United States participating in the "All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security" and was prepared to jointly study with relevant countries the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is another significant step by the Soviet Union in its unremitting efforts to consolidate European security and world peace.

The Soviet Union proposed a plan for establishing a European collective security system at the Berlin Conference, suggesting that European countries conclude an all-European treaty. Although this plan did not achieve an agreement at the Berlin Conference due to the opposition of Western countries, it has taken root in the hearts of the people and won the support of broad sections of the European population. Now, proceeding from the European people's desire for peace and the security interests of European countries, the Soviet government has once again put forward constructive and specific proposals to eliminate obstacles to the establishment of a European collective security system and promote the consolidation of European security and world peace.

The Soviet Union's new proposal is clearly aimed at eliminating hostile military blocs and consolidating European and world peace. As long as one is not merely paying lip service to peace and easing tensions, but is indeed willing to do so in action, there is no reason not to consider accepting the Soviet proposal. This is obvious.

Precisely because of this, the Soviet Union's peace proposal has immediately aroused great repercussions in public opinion in Western Europe and around the world. Peace-loving people of all countries, and all social and political figures in various countries who are unwilling to put their own countries' fate into inextricable danger, have expressed universal sympathy and support for the Soviet proposal. The Soviet proposal has greatly advanced the movement to strive for European collective security and prevent a new war, which has been widely unfolding in Europe since the Berlin Conference.

However, people have seen that the Soviet proposal has caused panic among the ruling groups in Western countries. They resisted the Soviet Union's plan to establish a European collective security system at the Berlin Conference, placing themselves in a more difficult situation. The United States is single-mindedly trying to erase the issue of European collective security from the agenda, and is trying to block the increasingly large breach through which their war plans have been broken. Now, it is rushing to block the new breach again.

Before even seeing the full text of the Soviet note, a U.S. State Department spokesperson hurriedly stated that the Soviet proposal could not be accepted. The old rules that the U.S. State Department has consistently arranged for the "concerted action" of the ruling groups of Western countries have been used even more crudely this time. The British bourgeois newspaper "The Observer" wrote: "The United States government, seeing that it is becoming increasingly difficult to formulate a common policy in the face of this defect (the different attitudes of the public on both sides of the Atlantic towards the idea of German rearmament and compromise with Communist China), is increasingly inclined to create accomplished facts with unilateral decisions and statements." Indeed, the U.S. State Department is trying to preemptively tie itself in knots according to its own intentions, so as to force its allies to take "concerted action" on the Soviet proposal when "consulting" with them.

However, the U.S. State Department's rash attitude of rejecting the Soviet proposal is untenable, and thus cannot but expose its actual intentions in the face of European and world public opinion. Those other Western countries that obediently follow the U.S. State Department's rules are, of course, even more embarrassed.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson attempted to dismiss the Soviet proposal as a major step towards European security, insisting that the Soviet proposal still brought the issue back to the divisions at the Berlin Conference. However, the Soviet proposal clearly answered the objections of Western countries to the Soviet Union's plan to establish a European collective security system at the Berlin Conference, and is fully sufficient to resolve this division. The United States and other Western countries then objected to not including the United States as a formal member of the all-European treaty, and insisted that the Soviet Union wanted to abolish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But now, doesn't the Soviet proposal eliminate this difficulty that hinders reaching an agreement on the issue of establishing a European collective security system?

In fact, the facts, past and present, have proven that the real crux of the matter is that the U.S. State Department is fundamentally unwilling to eliminate the division and antagonism in Europe, thereby consolidating peace in Europe, but wants to cling to the "European Defense Community" and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, using it to revive German militarism, deepen the division of Europe, and turn Western Europe into a hotbed for re-launching war.

The truth of the matter is thus thoroughly revealed. U.S. diplomats and their followers have always described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as "defensive," and have also tried to conceal the fact that this treaty is an aggressive bloc with its spearhead pointed at the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democracies. But now, when the Soviet Union expresses its willingness to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, their fig leaf is no longer able to cover them. They either openly state that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is aimed at the Soviet Union, or evasively say that if the Soviet Union joins the treaty, it will lose its "meaning and effect." There are even figures posing as "U.S. diplomatic officials" who express their "sarcastic attitude," saying that if the Soviet Union can join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then it can also be allowed to join the U.S. "National Security Council" and "Central Intelligence Agency." This, of course, is not a "sarcastic remark" about the Soviet proposal, but precisely a true sarcasm of Dulles's "comprehensive diplomacy policy." Because, according to the "U.S. diplomatic official," the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is actually a branch of the U.S. State Department. Figures who live by overbearing "strength politics" often reveal their ulterior political motives in the form of naked arrogance under the excitement of their warmongering emotions.

However, in this way, the conductor of the U.S. State Department's rhapsody cannot but embarrass his followers. When the diplomatic authorities of major Western European countries such as Britain and France followed the U.S. State Department in expressing their attitude towards the Soviet proposal, they had to use various self-defeating arguments to reject the Soviet proposal, putting themselves in a self-contradictory situation. The British and French diplomatic authorities insisted that the Soviet Union's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could not guarantee peace, and that they could only maintain a North Atlantic Treaty Organization that excludes the Soviet Union and rely on this treaty to maintain "strong power" in order to have "peace." France's position is even more difficult, so Bidault, while rejecting the Soviet proposal, had to express his willingness to discuss security issues with the Soviet Union. Although some major Western European countries have to shout along with the U.S. "strength politics" and often have to accept the dangers and damages brought to them by the U.S. "strength politics," they still express their belief that "Western strength is necessary for peace." Obviously, it is difficult for the diplomatic authorities of these countries to convince the people that pursuing the U.S. "strength politics" and engaging in military blocs can lead to any peace. The common people of Western Europe know that if there is truly to be peace, all countries, especially major powers, must accept the obligation to defend peace and undertake common constraints, and the security of Europe must be guaranteed jointly by all European countries. Isn't this a very obvious principle?

In fact, the policy of establishing military blocs of a few countries in Europe is being met with increasingly strong opposition from broad sections of people in European countries. It is precisely because of this that although the United States has exhausted all kinds of means such as "aid," "guarantees," and "ultimatums" to entice Western European countries, especially to entice France, to ratify the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty after the Berlin Conference; the matter is still extremely unsuccessful. The French Laniel government is still finding it difficult to accept the repeated pressure exerted by the United States to set a date for the National Assembly to debate the European Army Treaty. Now, in France and other Western European countries, more and more people have realized that the "European Defense Community" treaty is incompatible with their vital interests, and these countries are seeking a way out of this predicament. It is no accident that even people like French General Juin oppose the establishment of a European army, believing that another solution should be sought. From this, it can be seen that as long as the countries of Europe decide their policies in accordance with their own national interests rather than the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, guaranteeing European collective security is entirely achievable.

    保障欧洲集体安全的道路是堵塞不住的
    吴全
    苏联政府三月三十一日照会法、英、美三国政府，就保障欧洲集体安全问题提出了新的建议。苏联政府在照会中表示：赞成美国参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”，并准备和有关国家共同研究关于苏联参加北大西洋公约的问题。这是苏联坚持不懈地致力于巩固欧洲安全与世界和平的又一重大的步骤。
    苏联在柏林会议上曾经提出一个关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的方案，建议欧洲国家缔结一项全欧条约。尽管这个方案由于西方国家的反对而没有在柏林会议上取得协议，但是它已深入人心，博得了欧洲广大阶层人士的拥护。现在苏联政府从欧洲人民的和平愿望及欧洲各国的安全利益出发，再次提出了建设性的具体建议，以便消除建立欧洲集体安全体系的存在的障碍，促进欧洲安全与世界和平的巩固。
    苏联这个新建议的旨在消除敌对军事集团、巩固欧洲及世界和平的积极性质，是一目了然的。只要不是口头上说要和平、要缓和紧张局势，而是在行动上也的确愿意这样做，那就没有理由不考虑接受苏联的建议。这是再明显不过的事了。
    正是因为这样，苏联的这个和平建议，立即在西欧和世界各国舆论中引起了巨大的反响。各国爱好和平的人民，和所有不愿使自己的国家的命运陷于不能自拔的危险境地的各国社会政治界人士，都对苏联的建议表示普遍的同情和支持。苏联的建议使得柏林会议以来正在欧洲广泛展开的争取欧洲集体安全、阻止新战争的运动，大大推前一步。
    但是，人们看到，苏联的建议却使西方国家统治集团感到惊慌失措。它们在柏林会议上抵制了苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的方案，使自己陷于更困难的处境中。美国一心想使欧洲集体安全的问题从日程上抹掉，竭力堵塞它们的战争计划已被冲破了的日益巨大的决口。现在，它又赶忙来堵塞新的决口了。
    美国国务院发言人还没有看到苏联照会的全文，就慌慌张张地表示不能接受苏联的建议。美国国务院一贯地为西方国家统治集团的“一致行动”而安排的老规矩，又一次地更粗暴地使用出来了。英国资产阶级报纸“观察家报”写道：“美国政府看到，在面临着这种缺陷（大西洋两岸的公众对于德国重新武装以及和共产党中国妥协的想法所持有的不同态度）的情况下，要制定一个共同的政策是愈来愈困难了，它就愈来愈倾向于以片面的决定和声明来制造既成事实。”的确，美国国务院就是这样地企图抢先根据自己的意图预先打上死结，以便与它的盟国“商量”时强迫它们对苏联建议采取“一致行动”。
    可是，美国国务院拒绝苏联建议的轻率态度是站不住脚的，因而不能不使它在欧洲和世界舆论面前暴露它的实际意图。那些委曲求全地按照美国国务院的规矩行事的其他西方国家当然更加为难了。
    美国国务院发言人企图抹煞苏联提出的这个建议是导致欧洲安全的重大步骤，硬说苏联的建议仍使问题回到柏林会议时的分歧上面。但是，苏联的建议显然是回答了西方国家在柏林会议上对苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系方案的反对意见，并且完全足以解除这个分歧。美国和其他西方国家那时反对不把美国以正式成员参加全欧条约，并硬说苏联要废除北大西洋公约。但是，现在苏联的建议不是可以使阻碍建立欧洲集体安全体系问题达成协议的这个困难为之消除了吗？
    实际上，过去和现在的事实都证明了，真正的症结是在于：美国国务院根本不愿意消除欧洲的分裂和敌对状态，从而巩固欧洲的和平，而是要死死抱住“欧洲防务集团”和北大西洋公约，用它来复活德国军国主义，加深欧洲的分裂，把西欧变成重新发动战争的温床。
    事实的真相正是这样地被彻底地揭穿了。美国外交家和它的追随者们一直把北大西洋公约说成是“防御性”的，并且还企图掩饰这个公约是一个矛头指向苏联和东欧人民民主国家的侵略集团。但是，现在当苏联表示愿意参加北大西洋公约的时候，他们的遮羞布就盖不住了。他们不是直言不讳地公开表明北大西洋公约是针对苏联，就躲躲闪闪地说如果苏联参加了这个公约就会失掉它的“意义和效力”。甚至有这样的以“美国外交官员”出面的人物来表示他的“讥讽态度”，说什么如果苏联可以参加北大西洋公约，那末也就可以容许苏联参加美国的“国家安全委员会”和“中央情报局”了。这当然不是对苏联建议的什么“讥讽”，而恰恰是对杜勒斯的“全面外交政策”的真正的讥讽。因为，照“美国外交官员”说来，北大西洋公约竟然是美国国务院的分支机构了。靠横行霸道的“实力政策”过日子的人物，往往总是要在他们好战情绪的激动下，把自己的不可告人的政治意图用赤裸裸的狂妄的形式表现出来的。
    但是，这样一来，美国国务院的狂想曲的指挥者却不能不使他的追随者狼狈不堪了。西欧主要国家如英法等国的外交当局，在跟着美国国务院对苏联建议表示态度时，就不得不用各种无法自圆其说的论调来拒绝苏联的建议，使自己陷于自相矛盾的境地。英法外交当局硬说苏联参加北大西洋公约不能对和平有所保障，它们只有保持排斥苏联在外的北大西洋公约，靠这个公约保持“强大的力量”，才会有“和平”。法国的立场更困难，于是，皮杜尔在拒绝苏联建议的同时，不得不表示愿意与苏联讨论安全问题。虽然西欧有些主要国家已不能不跟着美国的“实力政策”呐喊，经常要接受美国“实力政策”给它们带来的危险和损害；但是，他们居然还表示相信“西方的实力是和平所必需的”。显然，这些国家的外交当局已很难使人民相信：奉行美国的“实力政策”，搞军事集团，会能有什么和平。西欧普通人民都知道：如果真要和平，就要所有国家特别是大国都来接受保卫和平的义务，承担共同的约束，欧洲的安全就要靠所有欧洲国家都来共同作出保证。这不是很明显的道理吗？
    事实上，在欧洲建立少数国家军事集团的政策，正遭受到欧洲国家广大阶层人士越来越强烈的反对。正是因为如此，所以尽管美国在柏林会议之后用尽了“援助”、“保证”、“最后通牒”等各种各样的手段来诱迫西欧国家，尤其是诱迫法国批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约；但是事情却依然极不顺利。法国的拉尼埃政府依然难于接受美国一再施行的压力来确定国民议会辩论欧洲军条约的日期。现在在法国和其他西欧国家中，已经有愈来愈多的人认识到“欧洲防务集团”条约和他们的切身利益毫不相容，这些国家都正在寻求摆脱这种困境的出路。甚至像法国的许温将军这样的人，也反对建立欧洲军，认为应当谋求另外一种解决的办法，这都不是偶然的。由此可以看到，只要欧洲的国家按照本身的民族利益而不是按照美国垄断资本的利益决定自己的政策，保障欧洲集体安全是完全可以实现的。
