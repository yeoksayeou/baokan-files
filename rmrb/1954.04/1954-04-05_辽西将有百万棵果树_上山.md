Liaoxi Province will plant one million fruit trees "up the mountains" this year. With the support of the state, the original fruit trees in various parts of the province have been restored. Last year, the People's Government put forward the slogan "Fruit Trees Up the Mountains," and planted another 1.07 million fruit trees, accounting for 26.1 percent of the total number of original fruit trees. Among these, the number of apple trees more than tripled, giving a new impetus to the fruit tree industry in Liaoxi Province. Last year, the province's output of apples, pears, peaches, plums, and grapes reached 100,400 tons. This year, in order to develop the fruit tree industry, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, under the principle of not competing with "grain and cotton for land," has put forward a new task of planting "one million fruit trees up the mountains." To ensure the realization of this plan, the Provincial People's Government has issued instructions and organized six "Fruit Trees Up the Mountains Work Teams" to go to six key counties to assist in the "Fruit Trees Up the Mountains" work. In order to improve the survival rate of fruit trees, the Provincial Fruit Tree Nursery has established branch nurseries for cultivating fruit tree seedlings in Suizhong, Xingcheng, Yixian, Beizhen, and Jinxian, so as to systematically promote good varieties, eliminate pests and diseases, and prevent speculation by seedling merchants. Now, farmers in the mountainous areas are confidently carrying out the work of planting fruit trees, and they want to turn the barren mountains into orchards.

    辽西将有百万棵果树“上山”
    辽西省今年要有一百万棵果树“上山”。在国家的扶持下，全省各地原有果树得到恢复。去年人民政府提出“果树上山”的口号，又栽植了一百零七万棵果树，占原有果树总棵数的百分之二十六点一，其中苹果超过三倍多，使辽西省果树业有了新的发展。去年全省苹果、梨、桃、李子和葡萄的产量达十万零四千吨。今年，辽西省人民政府为了发展果树事业，在不与“粮棉争地”的原则下，提出了“百万棵果树上山”的新任务。为了保证这一计划的实现，省人民政府又发出了指示，并组织六个“果树上山工作队”，分赴六个重点县协助进行“果树上山”工作。省果树苗圃为了提高果树的成活率，在绥中、兴城、义县、北镇、锦县建立了培育果树苗分圃，以便有计划地推广良种，杜绝病虫和防止苗商的投机。现在山区农民正满怀信心地展开栽植果树工作，他们要把秃山变成果园。
