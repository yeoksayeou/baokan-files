　　People's China Cannot Be Ignored
    Editor's Note: On the eve of the Geneva Conference, people from all walks of life in various countries around the world (including some bourgeois figures in capitalist countries and even some people in power) have successively advocated restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in resolving pressing international issues and restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations. The following are excerpts from these statements:
    　　　　＊　　　　　　　　　＊　　　　　　　　　　＊
    The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement saying: "Restoring the People's Republic of China to its rightful place in the United Nations is absolutely necessary to ease tensions in Asia and the world."
    Pierre Gotte, editor of "Defend Peace" magazine, said: "In the West, everyone knows that some major basic issues, such as disarmament, the role of the United Nations, the fate of Asia, and business relations between East and West, etc., cannot be resolved without the participation of People's China, and even serious discussions are impossible."
    Mrs. Blum, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council from Belgium, said: "Only by convening a meeting of the five major powers with the participation of China and the Soviet Union can we create an atmosphere in which our current problems can be solved."
    Silmonte, Chairman of the Brazilian Peace Committee, said: "The people of Brazil, like the people of the world, cannot believe that true peace for all mankind can be achieved by denying the People's Republic of China its legitimate place in the United Nations."
    Mexican General Hara said: "Now some people in the highest political circles are talking about a possible meeting of the five major powers, but one of the five powers still wants to be the strongest among the strong... insisting on excluding the great People's Republic of China... we can't help but ask, what right do they have to do this?"
    Colombian writer Salamia said: "The governments of most Latin American countries follow the orders of the US State Department and refuse to recognize the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which is not at all the opinion of the Latin American people."
    Govind Sahai, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India, said: "We firmly support the demand for recognition of the government of the People's Republic of China, and we also believe that without the participation of great China in international conferences, all efforts to ease international tensions will be in vain."
    Dr. Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York, England, wrote in a letter to the Diocese of York: "It is hard to imagine that China should be permanently excluded from the United Nations if China wishes to become a member of the United Nations."
    British Deputy Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd said: "It is wrong not to take into account the fact that the Central People's Government is the true and effective government of China."
    Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent said: "We will one day have to look at the facts realistically and recognize that the current Chinese government is a government that meets the wishes of the people."

　　人民中国不容忽视
    编者按：在日内瓦会议前夕，世界各国各个阶层的人士（包括资本主义国家的某些资产阶级人士甚至某些当权人物），纷纷主张恢复中华人民共和国在解决迫切的国际问题上的权利，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利。下面就是这些言论的摘录：
    　　　　＊　　　　　　　　　＊　　　　　　　　　　＊
    日本拥护和平委员会发表了一项声明说：“恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的应有地位，对于缓和亚洲和世界的紧张局势是绝对必要的。”
    “保卫和平”杂志主编皮埃尔·戈特说：“在西方，每个人都知道若干重大的基本问题，如裁减军备、联合国组织作用、亚洲的命运、东方与西方之间的商务关系等等，如果没有人民中国参加，不可能得到解决，甚至连认真的研讨也是不可能的。”
    世界和平理事会常务委员会委员，比利时的布伦姆夫人说：“只有召开有中国和苏联参加的五大国会议，才能造成使我们当前的问题得以解决的气氛。”
    巴西和平委员会主席西尔蒙特说：“我们巴西人民如同全世界人民一样，不能相信拒绝中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，而能得到全人类的真正和平。”
    墨西哥哈拉将军说：“现在最高政治方面有人在谈论五大国可能举行会议，然而五强之中某一强国还是想当强中之强……坚持排斥伟大的中华人民共和国……我们不禁要问，他们有什么权利这样做？”
    哥伦比亚作家萨拉米亚说：“大多数拉丁美洲国家的政府执行美国国务院的命令，在联合国中拒绝承认中华人民共和国，这根本不是拉丁美洲人民的意见。”
    印度北方省立法议会议员戈文德·萨海说：“我们坚决支持要求承认中华人民共和国政府，我们也认为没有伟大的中国参加国际会议，将使一切缓和国际紧张局势的努力归于无效。”
    英国约克郡大主教西里尔·加伯特博士写给约克主教区的信里说：“很难想象中国应当被永远排斥在联合国以外，如果中国希望成为联合国会员国的话。”
    英外交副大臣塞尔温·劳埃德说：“如果不考虑到中央人民政府是中国的真正有效的政府这一事实，是错误的。”
    加拿大总理圣劳伦说：“我们总有一天不得不现实地来看待事实，并承认现在的中国政府是一个符合人民愿望的政府。”
