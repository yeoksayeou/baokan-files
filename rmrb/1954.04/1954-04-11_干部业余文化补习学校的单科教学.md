The general characteristics of students in cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools are: older age, relatively rich life and struggle experience, strong comprehension, and an urgent need to learn culture; however, due to busy work schedules, high mobility, and limited study time, they face more difficulties in learning. Therefore, how to adapt teaching and class organization to these characteristics has become an important issue in running cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools well.

In the three years before 1953, most cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools in Hebei Province adopted the teaching method of multiple subjects concurrently or two subjects concurrently. Teaching with multiple subjects concurrently encountered many difficulties. The work of cadres in government offices is generally relatively busy, and a lot of energy is already spent on work. If they have to study several subjects simultaneously in their spare time, it is indeed too much of a burden. Cadres generally only have six or seven hours a week for cultural studies. In a short period of time, with limited energy, learning two or three subjects simultaneously, because the nature of the subjects are different and the content is complex, they will inevitably lose sight of one thing while attending to another, and will not learn any of them well. With various subjects progressing simultaneously, it often takes two or three years to complete a subject. Some cadres often "give up halfway" or have to "start from scratch" because of job transfers. Therefore, many students feel that "graduation from middle school is a distant prospect," which affects the learning enthusiasm of the majority of workers and peasants cadres.

The cultural level of workers and peasants cadres is uneven. Generally speaking, the language level of cadres in Party, government, and mass organization departments is higher than their arithmetic level, while the mathematical level of some business personnel in economic departments is higher than their language level. Thus, there are also great difficulties in class organization. If classes are organized according to language proficiency, then arithmetic proficiency will be uneven; if classes are organized according to arithmetic proficiency, then language proficiency will be uneven. No matter how classes are organized, there will always be many difficulties in teaching.

In order to make teaching and class organization further adapt to the characteristics of cadre spare-time cultural learning, the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School began to implement the method of single-subject class organization and teaching in 1952. After more than half a year of experimentation, it achieved preliminary experience. Since 1953, this method has been promoted throughout the province. Now, most cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools above the county level have adopted the single-subject teaching method. The results of the trial implementation in various places generally reflect that the implementation of single-subject teaching has "good results and great achievements," and it is considered to be a more practical teaching method in cadre spare-time cultural learning.

What are the advantages of single-subject class organization and teaching?

First, time is concentrated, and the learning of a certain subject can be completed in a short period of time, which is suitable for the characteristics of cadres with "little study time" and "high mobility." For example, when the Shijiazhuang Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School used to implement two-subject teaching, some classes started learning algebra in the second half of 1951 and had not finished learning it by the end of 1952. After implementing single-subject teaching, they can complete junior high school algebra in twelve or thirteen weeks (with seven and a half hours of class per week). When the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School used to implement two-subject teaching, it took more than two years to complete arithmetic. After implementing single-subject teaching, the number of arithmetic teaching hours was reduced from 504 hours to 360 hours; later, after streamlining the teaching materials and implementing the spirit of accelerated learning, the task of arithmetic teaching could be completed in 170 hours. In this way, the problem of cadres dropping out of school due to job transfers is relatively solved. If a cadre can work in a certain area for a longer period of time, he or she can complete one or several subjects. For example, in the first semester of 1953, the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School had a total of 62 classes, with more than 3,200 people each completing one subject. In Tongxian Special District, county-level and above cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools had 1,323 students complete elementary school language, 370 students complete junior high school language, 991 students complete arithmetic, 243 students complete junior high school algebra, 124 students complete junior high school chemistry, and 79 students complete junior high school geography in 1953. In Tangshan Special District (the entire special district), eighty classes were promoted, forty classes graduated, and fifteen classes graduated in one year. Even the most dispersed district and township cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools have had graduates since the implementation of single-subject teaching. For example, in the seventh district of Lulong County, all language courses had reached the level of upper elementary school graduation by the end of 1953.

Second, energy is concentrated, and the teaching effect is great. Cadres' work is heavy, and the more types of courses there are, the more dispersed their energy will be, and as a result, they cannot help but lose sight of one thing while attending to another. Single-subject teaching focuses on one subject, making it easier for teachers to guide and easier for students to accept. At the same time, teachers teach continuously in one class and are more familiar with the situation of each student in the class. Therefore, it is easier to connect with reality when lecturing, continuously improve teaching quality, and achieve higher teaching effectiveness. The algebra test scores of a single-subject class and two two-subject classes in the Shijiazhuang Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School were: the single-subject class averaged 78 points, one two-subject class averaged 58 points, and the other class averaged 63 points. From this, it can be clearly seen that the effect of single-subject teaching is better. For example, after the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School implemented single-subject teaching, the promotion rate of each subject increased from about 70 percent in the past to about 90 percent. Many students said: Single-subject teaching is really a good method. Learning for one year is learning for one year, and it really works! Due to the better effect of single-subject class organization and teaching, students' learning enthusiasm has also increased. Some cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools have almost eliminated the phenomenon of being late or absent.

Third, single-subject teaching can meet the work needs of cadres and the different requirements of students. Due to the different nature of students' work, their learning requirements are also different. For example, cadres in Party and government departments mainly require improving their language skills, while cadres in economic and enterprise departments are eager to learn mathematics and science knowledge. The implementation of single-subject teaching can meet these different requirements of students.

Fourth, single-subject teaching is also simpler in management work. According to preliminary calculations by the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School, it can reduce the workload by one-half in terms of registration, attendance, and performance evaluation compared with the method of multiple subjects concurrently.

Based on our work experience in the past six months, we believe that the following issues should be paid attention to in the implementation of single-subject class organization and teaching:

First, ideological problems should be solved at any time. At the beginning of the implementation of single-subject teaching in the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School, some students believed that single-subject teaching only involves learning one subject at a time and can be quickly completed without much effort, and they underestimated the difficulties in learning; when they encountered difficulties, they easily lost confidence in learning. On the teacher's side, there are conservative ideas. Some think that the progress of single-subject teaching is too fast and they are afraid of not being able to keep up; some think that single-subject teaching will make students bored. These problems must be addressed according to different situations, with persuasion and explanation, so that teachers and students have a correct understanding of single-subject teaching, in order to successfully complete the teaching task.

Second, the order of courses in single-subject class organization and teaching should generally be humanities courses first, followed by science courses. Generally, students should first study language to lay the foundation for studying other subjects. In experiments, the spare-time cultural supplementary school in an individual county in Hebei Province first learned arithmetic, and as a result, because the cadres had few literacy skills, they also found it difficult to learn arithmetic, the learning effect was not great, and they could not perform calculations after learning. In the arithmetic single-subject class of the Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Supplementary School, there were also a few students with low language proficiency. Because their self-study and comprehension skills were poor, they also had to learn literacy while learning arithmetic, which increased the difficulty of teaching, and some even dropped out halfway. However, some people have this idea: to improve language all the way to junior high school graduation, and then return to learn arithmetic. This is also inappropriate. In their work, cadres must have a certain level of language to read documents and write materials, and they must also have a certain calculation ability. For example, making statistics, making plans, and leading industrial and agricultural production all require a certain amount of arithmetic knowledge and calculation ability. It is also not in line with the needs of cadres to postpone the time of learning arithmetic too much. Our experience is that it is more appropriate to learn arithmetic after improving students' language to the level of upper elementary school; after learning arithmetic, then continue to learn middle school language. Will this affect the connection between arithmetic and algebra? There is some impact, but the problem is not big. As long as arithmetic is really learned and continuously applied in work, it is still possible to connect with middle school algebra after learning middle school language.

Third, due to the faster progress of single-subject teaching, we should try to take care of the evenness of the students' level in the same class, otherwise it will cause difficulties in teaching. First of all, we must conduct strict class organization tests. Secondly, we must do a good job in the work of students receiving lessons, making up lessons, and group self-study when they go to the countryside or on business trips. When necessary, it is also necessary to transfer students who have missed too many lessons and cannot make up the missed homework to appropriate classes to learn, in order to maintain the evenness of the level, and to ensure the completion of the teaching plan. At the same time, in places with many classes, we should also take care to organize students with the same graduation subject into one class, so that they can transfer to learn another subject without moving the original class after graduating from one subject, avoiding the trouble of reorganizing classes.

Fourth, regarding the issue of accelerated learning. Although the implementation of single-subject teaching further adapts to the characteristics of cadre spare-time cultural learning, shortens the teaching time, and improves the quality of teaching, this does not completely solve the problem of accelerated learning; therefore, we should not overemphasize speed and rush progress, in order to prevent "speed without success." As for how to achieve accelerated learning, such as compiling and selecting teaching materials suitable for cadre learning and further creating various accelerated learning teaching methods and other specific issues, we should naturally actively study and solve them.

    干部业余文化补习学校的单科教学
    河北省人民政府教育厅
    干部业余文化补习学校学员的一般特点是：年龄较大，生活和斗争经验比较丰富，理解力强，学习文化的要求迫切；但由于工作较忙，流动性大，学习时间少，学习上的困难便较多。因此，如何在教学和编班上适应这些特点，就成为办好干部业余文化补习学校的一个重要问题。
    在一九五三年以前的三年中，河北省各地干部业余文化补习学校大多采取多科并进或双科并进的教学方法。采用多科并进的方法进行教学，碰到了不少困难。机关干部的工作一般是比较繁忙的，日常用于工作方面的精力已经很多，如果在业余再要同时进行数种学科的学习，确实负担太重。干部每周用在文化学习上的时间一般只有六、七个小时，在较短的时间内，以有限的精力同时进行两三门学科的学习，因为学科性质不同，内容复杂，势必顾此失彼，那门也学不好。各种学科同时并进，一种学科往往要二、三年的时间才能结业，有些干部因为调动工作，往往会“半途而废”或要“从头学起”，因此，不少学员感到“中学毕业，遥遥无期”，这就影响到广大工农干部的学习情绪。
    工农干部的文化程度是参差不齐的，大体上是党、政府、群众团体等机关部门的干部语文水平高于算术水平，而经济部门的某些业务人员则数理水平高于语文水平。这样，编班也有很大的困难，依语文程度编班则算术程度不齐，依算术程度编班，则语文程度不齐。不论怎么样编班，教学上总有很多困难。
    为了使教学和编班进一步适应干部业余文化学习的特点，河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校于一九五二年起开始实行单科编班教学的方法，经过半年多的实验，取得了初步经验。一九五三年起，这种方法已在全省范围内推行，现在各地县以上的大多数干部业余文化补习学校业已采用单科教学的方法。各地试行结果，普遍反映实行单科教学的“效果好，成绩大”，认为这是在干部业余文化学习中一个比较切合实际的教学方法。
    单科编班教学有那些优点呢？
    一、时间集中，能在短期内完成某种学科的学习，适合干部“学习时间少”“流动性大”的特点。如石家庄市干部业余文化补习学校过去实行双科教学时，有的班从一九五一年下半年开始学习代数，到一九五二年年底还没有学完。实行单科教学后，在十二、三周内（每周上课七时半），就能学完初中代数。河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校过去实行双科教学时，两年多的功夫才能学完算术。实行单科教学后，算术教学时数就由五百○四小时缩短到三百六十小时；后来经过精简教材，贯彻速成的教学精神，用一百七十小时就能完成算术教学的任务。这样，就相对地解决了干部因调动工作而中途辍学的问题。如果一个干部能在某一地区工作一个较长的时期，就能学完一门或几门学科。如河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校一九五三年上学期共有六十二个班，计三千二百多人各结业一门学科。通县专区县以上干部业余文化补习学校在一九五三年内就有一千三百二十三个学员学完初小语文，三百七十人学完初中语文，九百九十一人学完算术，二百四十三人学完初中代数，一百二十四人学完初中化学，七十九人学完初中地理。唐山专区（全专区）一年中有八十个班升级，四十个班结业，十五个班毕业。连最分散的区、乡的干部业余文化补习学校自实行单科教学以后，也有结业的了。如卢龙县七区，到一九五三年年底语文科已全部达到高小毕业程度。
    二、精力集中，教学效果大。干部的工作是繁重的，课程门类越多，精力越分散，结果不能不顾此失彼。单科教学专攻一门，教师易于指导，学员易于接受。同时，教师在一个班内连续上课，对班中每个学员的情况比较熟悉，因而讲课时容易联系实际，不断提高教学质量，取得较高的教学效果。石家庄市干部业余文化补习学校一个单科班和两个双科班的代数测验的成绩是：单科班平均分数七十八分，双科班一班平均五十八分，一班平均六十三分。从这里，就可以清楚地看到单科教学的效果是比较好的。又如河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校实行单科教学后，各科的升级率即由过去的百分之七十提高到百分之九十左右。不少学员说：单科教学真是一个好方法，学一年是一年，真见效！由于单科编班教学效果较好，学员的学习情绪也随之高涨，有些干部业余文化补习学校几乎已消灭了迟到旷课的现象。
    三、单科教学能适合干部的工作需要和学员的不同要求。由于学员的工作性质不同，他们的学习要求也就不同。如党和政府部门的干部主要是要求提高语文水平，经济企业部门的干部则急于学习数、理知识。实行单科教学可适应学员这种不同的要求。
    四、单科教学，在管理工作上也较简便。据河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校初步计算，在注册、考勤、考绩等方面，和多科并进的方法比较，可以减少二分之一的工作。
    根据半年来的工作体会，我们认为在实行单科编班教学中应注意下面几个问题：
    一、要随时解决思想问题。河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校在实行单科教学之初，部分学员认为单科教学只是一门一门地学，不费力就能速成，对于学习中的困难估计不足；及至遇到困难，又容易丧失学习信心。在教师方面，有保守思想。有的认为单科教学进度快，怕跟不上；有的认为单科教学会使学员学着腻烦。这些问题，都必须根据不同情况，进行说服解释，使教师和学员对单科教学有正确的认识，才能胜利地完成教学任务。
    二、单科编班教学，课程进行的次序一般地应先文科后理科。一般学员应先学习语文，为学习其他学科打下基础。在实验中，河北省有个别县的业余文化补习学校先学算术，结果因为干部识字少，学算术也感到困难，学习效果不大，学了不会运算。河北省直属机关干部业余文化补习学校的算术单科班中，也有少数语文水平低的学员，因自修和理解力差，在学习算术中还要兼学识字，增加了教学上的困难，有些人以致于中途掉队。但也有人有这样一种想法：把语文一直提高到初中毕业程度，再返回来学算术，这也是不合适的。干部在工作中，既须要有一定的语文水平来看文件写材料，也须有一定的计算能力，比如作统计，拟计划，领导工农业生产，都需要有一定的算术知识和运算能力，过于推迟学习算术的时间，也是不合干部需要的。我们的体验是，把学员的语文提高到高小水平后，就可以学算术；学完算术后，再接上学中学语文，这是比较合适的。这是不是会影响算术和代数的衔接呢？是有一些影响的，但问题不大，只要把算术切实学会，在工作中不断应用，学完中学语文再学中学代数还是能衔接的。
    三、由于单科教学进度较快，应尽量照顾在同一班级内学员程度的整齐，不然会造成教学上的困难。首先须严格进行编班测验。其次必须做好学员在下乡或出差时的领课、补课及小组自习的工作。必要时还需将误课太多不能补齐功课跟班学习的学员调到适当班次去学习，才能保持程度的整齐，也才能保证完成教学计划。同时，在班级多的地方，也应照顾到把结业学科相同的学员编在一班，在一种学科结业后就可原班不动，转学另一学科，避免重新编班的麻烦。
    四、关于速成问题。实行单科教学，虽然进一步适合了干部业余文化学习的特点，缩短了教学时间，教学质量有所提高，但这并不能全部解决速成的问题；因此，不应过分地强调快速而赶进度，以防“速而不成”。至于如何达到速成，如编选适合干部学习的教材以及进一步创造各种速成的教学方法等具体问题，自然应积极研究解决。
