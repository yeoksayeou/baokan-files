    A Department Store in the Capital
    Shen Wenying
    The Beijing No. 1 Department Store of the China Department Store Beijing Company, located on Wangfujing Street in the capital, is usually very prosperous. In the run-up to the "May Day" holiday, it presented an even more prosperous scene. Groups of male and female customers, like countless streams, converged here from all directions. On ordinary days, more than thirteen thousand customers come here every day. On Sundays, the number doubles. On April 25th, it increased by more than two times.
    The flow of people poured through the gate between the two large red pillars, and once inside, the flow divided into several streams heading in all directions. In the shirt department, girls watched various beautiful shirts and tried on various skirts, meticulously selecting their holiday outfits. Workers and office staff members selected various shirts that satisfied them in batches, and the salespersons busily served these endless streams of customers. Salesperson Shi Jinxian said: Although this year, twenty kinds of men's and women's shirts made of various silks and fabrics have been added, the new varieties are quickly sold out as soon as they arrive at the store. On April 4th, the first business hall alone sold nearly six hundred men's and women's shirts, many of which were made of newly added silk, floral seersucker, plaid, and striped poplin.
    Female customers holding or supporting children were all gathered in the children's clothing department. Although the little ones don’t participate in the parade, the mothers want to dress their children up nicely for the holiday. There are particularly many varieties and styles of children’s clothing. This year, the children’s clothing department has increased to 278 kinds of goods, including 94 kinds of noble embroidered double crepe dance clothes and skirts, shirts, and various corduroy children’s clothing newly shipped from Shanghai. The supply has increased by about 100% compared to last year. However, female customers still say that more inexpensive, beautiful, and novel children's clothing should be prepared.
    The fabric group on the second floor has recently received a large batch of brightly colored prints and various seersuckers. These floral seersuckers are both harmonious and bright in color. The girls all say: This piece of material is good, that piece is also good, they are all very good. Some shouted: Look! How beautiful! How pretty! Middle-aged women are selecting seersucker and various linen fabrics with more plain colors. Various colored lace skirt fabrics newly produced by the Tianjin No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory have begun to be supplied. Young girls all love it. The various oriental gabardines that have arrived this year are diverse and elegant in color. The girls are all buying them to sew beautiful skirts or pants. Salesperson Feng Qingxiang said: "This year, the proportion of various rainproof cloths, khaki, and wool gabardine prepared by the No. 1 Department Store has increased by 40% compared to last year, and the quantity has increased by 20% compared to last year. However, customers not only want khaki, but also silk-glossed khaki at 9,000 yuan per foot; not only want good quality, but also particularly bright colors. Last year, workers bought twill or colored cloth to make uniforms. This year, many workers have already requested better fabrics. Some workers, after buying a piece of medium-quality khaki, saw that the silk-glossed khaki was beautiful and said: Give me another set of silk-glossed khaki. Some workers originally planned to buy a piece of cloth to make clothes for themselves, but later saw that the goods were good and they had enough money on hand, so they bought cloth for their spouses and children. One worker and his wife brought three children and bought more than two zhang of blue corduroy at one time.” The clothing department was crowded, and the newly arrived denim clothing was very popular with customers. Workers would say as soon as they opened their mouths: Give me a set of khaki; Give me a set of wool gabardine; Some customers requested that the company prepare some cloth. Some customers thought the clothing did not fit well, so they bought their favorite cloth at the beginning of the month and sewed it in the processing group. Now they are queuing up to receive their custom-made holiday clothes.
    Since entering April, the food department of the No. 1 Department Store's second business hall has often been overwhelmed because of the spring outing season. The supply of bread this year has doubled compared to last year. The supply of cream roll cakes and other assorted pastries has increased nearly twofold compared to last year, but it is still in short supply. Fruits and canned meat, and jams have become bestsellers. A large batch of Shanghai soft candies and various biscuits prepared especially for the holiday has begun to be supplied in large quantities. The food department's supply in recent days has increased by 140% compared to normal days.
    With the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of people, the supply has increased significantly. This year, the total sales of various commodities by the Beijing Department Store in the first quarter increased by 45.46% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the sales volume of small commodities (knitted cotton and woolen goods, daily cosmetics, enamelware, steel appliances, rubber shoes, woolen yarn, shirts, raincoats, etc.) urgently needed by the broad masses increased by 142.14%; the sales volume of sugar and bicycles increased by more than 90%; and the sales volume of cotton cloth increased by 35%. Although the purchase volume of sugar, socks, cotton cloth, and shirts this year has more than doubled compared to last year, and the varieties and colors of various commodities have increased, the needs of the masses have increased even more. The business director of the No. 1 Department Store said to me: “The total sales volume of the No. 1 Department Store in the first and middle ten days of April this year increased by 63.6% compared with the same period last year. The continuous improvement of people's lives is the benefit of the revolution, and it also poses new problems and new tasks for state-owned commercial workers. Now we are studying the laws of production and consumption, purchasing and sales based on customer opinions to improve our supply work.”
    …The day is almost over, but the torrent of customers has not diminished at all. The salespersons are still busy, and the customers leave the shopping mall with bags and bundles of selected supplies or food, with smiles on their faces.

    首都的一个百货公司
    沈文英
    首都王府井大街中国百货公司北京市公司第一门市部，平时是很繁荣的，“五一”节前夕，这里，呈现了更加繁荣的景象。一群群男女顾客像无数股流水一样，从四面八方汇集在这里。每天来这里的顾客，平常的日子有一万三千多人，遇星期日就要增加二倍，四月二十五日那天，就增加了两倍多。
    人流拥进两面大红圆柱子中间的大门，一到里面，人流分成数股流向四方。在衬衣部，姑娘们有的观看各式美丽的衬衣，有的在试穿各种裙子，经心地挑选她们节日的盛装。工人们和机关工作人员们一批一批地在这里挑选着各种自己满意的衬衣，售货员忙碌地应接这些川流不息的顾客。售货员史进贤说：虽然今年增加了各色绸、布的男女衬衣二十种，可是新品种一到门市部，很快就销光了。四月四日那天，单第一商场就销出了将近六百件男女衬衣，其中有很多是新添的丝质、花泡泡纱、花格、条府绸制成的。
    抱着或搀着孩子的女顾客们都围在童装部。虽然娃娃们不去参加游行，但妈妈们都愿意让孩子们打扮得漂漂亮亮过节日。童装的品种花样特别多，今年童装部增加到二百七十八种商品，其中包括新从上海运来的高贵的绣花双绉舞衣和裙、衫和各式灯芯绒童装等九十四种，供应量较去年增加约一倍。可是女顾客们还是说应该多备些价廉物美式样新颖的童装。
    二楼花布组新近进了大批艳丽的印花和各色泡泡纱。这些花泡泡纱颜色又调和又鲜艳，姑娘们都说：这段料子不错，那一段也不错，都挺好。有的直嚷嚷：瞧！多美！多漂亮！中年妇女在选购颜色较素净的泡泡纱和各色麻纱。新从天津第一印染厂出产的各色花边裙布已开始供应。年轻的姑娘们都喜爱它。今年新到的各色东方呢，颜色多样、雅致，姑娘们都买来缝制美丽的裙子或裤子。售货员冯清湘说：“今年第一门市部准备的各色防雨布、卡其布、华达呢的比重比去年增加百分之四十，数量比去年增加百分之二十，可是顾客们不仅要卡其布，而且要九千元一尺的丝光卡其布；不但要质量好的，而且要颜色也特别鲜亮的。去年工人都买斜纹或色布做制服，今年很多工人已经要求要更好的布料了；有的工人买了一块中等卡其布后，看见丝光卡其布漂亮就说：再来一套丝光卡其布的。有的工人本来打算自己买块布做衣服，后来看看东西好，手头钱有敷余，就给爱人、孩子都买了布。有一个工人和他爱人领了三个孩子来，一次就买了二丈多青色灯芯绒。”服装部挤得满满的，新到的劳动布服装很受顾客欢迎。工人们一开口就说：我来一套卡其布的；我来一套华达呢的；有些顾客要求公司能备些克罗丁的。还有一部分顾客嫌服装不合身，早在月初就买了可心的布在加工组缝制，现在正一个个排队等候着领取订制的节日服装。
    第一门市部第二商场的食品部自进入四月份以来，因值春游季节，售货员常常应接不暇。今年面包的供应量比去年增加一倍。奶油卷筒蛋糕等各色点心的供应量比去年增加近二倍，可是也是供不应求。水果和肉类罐头、果子酱成了畅销品。专为节日供应准备的大批上海软糖和各种饼干，已开始大量供应。食品部近日的供应量比平日又增加了百分之一百四十。
    随着广大人民生活水平的提高，供应量有了显著的增加。今年北京市百货公司第一季度各种商品的销售总额比去年同期增加了百分之四十五点四六，其中为广大群众迫切需要的小百货（针棉毛织品、日用化妆品、搪瓷、钢精用具、胶鞋、毛线、衬衣、雨衣等）的销售量就增加了百分之一百四十二点一四；糖、自行车的销售量增加百分之九十以上；棉布销售量增加百分之三十五。虽然今年糖、袜子、棉布、衬衣的进货量比去年增加一倍以上，而且各种商品在品种花色上都有增加，但是群众需要却更加增长。第一门市部的营业主任对我说：“第一门市部今年四月上旬和中旬的总销售量比去年同期增加了百分之六十三点六。人民生活的不断提高，正是革命的好处，也给国营商业工作者提出了新的问题和新的任务。现在我们正根据顾客的意见来研究生产和消费、进货和销货的规律，来改进我们的供应工作。”
    ……一天快要过去了，顾客的洪流丝毫没有减退，售货员们依然忙碌着，顾客们提着成包成捆所挑中的用品或食品，笑容满面地离开了商场。
