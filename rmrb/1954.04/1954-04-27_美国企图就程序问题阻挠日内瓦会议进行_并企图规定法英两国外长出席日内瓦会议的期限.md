Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: Western sources indicate that on the eve of the Geneva Conference, the United States is attempting to obstruct, or even sabotage, the Geneva Conference by raising procedural issues, and to expand the Indochina War. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the United States intends to "spend a lot of time arguing with Russia after the conference begins, not only about the status of China but also about the specific methods of conducting the conference—purely procedural issues such as what language to use and who invites whom." Reuters added: "Diplomats believe that perhaps many days will pass before the substantive issues of the conference—the Korean peace issue and the end of the Indochina War—can be discussed."

However, on the other hand, the United States is attempting to impose a deadline on the attendance of the French and British foreign ministers at the Geneva Conference. According to the "Christian Science Monitor," U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has proposed to France and Britain that the initial deadline for the foreign ministers of the three Western countries to attend the Geneva Conference be two weeks. The U.S. wants to spend "many days" on procedural issues while also "limiting" the conference to "two weeks." How can there be time to fully discuss and resolve substantive issues in this way?

The "Christian Science Monitor" also reported that after withdrawing from the conference, the United States intends to coerce France, Britain, and other allies to immediately hold negotiations to organize an aggressive bloc, and plans to sign a treaty for an aggressive bloc in Manila. If this treaty can be signed, the United States will force its allies to send troops to Indochina to fight against the Vietnamese people, turning the Indochina War into a second Korean War.

Peace-loving people around the world are closely watching the Geneva Conference and eagerly hope that the conference will achieve success. Whether the United States insists on implementing these ill-intentioned plans or seriously attends the conference to discuss issues, peace-loving people will pay close attention.

### 美国企图就程序问题阻挠日内瓦会议进行  并企图规定法英两国外长出席日内瓦会议的期限

    美国企图就程序问题阻挠日内瓦会议进行
    并企图规定法英两国外长出席日内瓦会议的期限
    【新华社二十五日讯】来自西方的消息表明：在日内瓦会议举行前夕，美国企图就会议的程序问题来阻挠甚至破坏日内瓦会议并扩大印度支那战争。据路透社的巴黎消息透露，美国在会议开始以后“要花费很多的时间与俄国争论，所争论的不但是中国的地位问题，还有进行会议的具体方法——用什么语言、谁邀请谁等纯粹程序问题”。路透社并说：“外交官们认为，也许要经过许多天以后，才能讨论会议的实质问题——朝鲜和平问题及结束印度支那战争问题。”
    但是，另一方面，美国又企图给法国和英国外交部长出席日内瓦会议规定一个期限。据美国“基督教科学箴言报”报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯已经向法国和英国提出西方三国的外交部长出席日内瓦会议的初步期限为两星期。美国一面要在程序问题上花“许多天”，一面又要把会议“限为两星期”。试问，这样如何能有时间来充分讨论和解决实质问题呢？
    又据“基督教科学箴言报”报道，美国企图在退出会议以后，胁迫法国、英国和其他盟国立刻举行组织侵略集团的谈判，并且打算在马尼拉签订侵略集团的条约；如果这个条约能够签订，美国就要迫使它的盟国派遣军队到印度支那去对越南人民作战，把印度支那战争变成第二个朝鲜战争。
    全世界爱好和平人民正在密切注视着日内瓦会议，并热烈希望会议取得成就。美国究竟是坚持实现这些不怀好意的打算，还是正经开会来讨论问题，爱好和平的人们是会加以严密注意的。
