In areas along the Huai River in Anhui Province, such as Suxian and Fuyang, crop conversion work is proceeding vigorously.

The Suxian Special District plans to convert and restore 200,200 mu to paddy fields this year, trial-plant 100,000 mu of potatoes, and promote the cultivation of gaoliang (sorghum) and "Victory Hundred" sweet potatoes on a portion of land. Huaiyuan and Wuhe counties have been designated as key counties for converting and restoring paddy fields, while Suxian and Suixi counties have been designated as key counties for trial-planting potatoes. The Fuyang Special District is restoring and converting more than 27,000 mu to paddy fields in Yingshang, Fuyang, Funan, and Linquan counties, and trial-planting more than 10,000 mu of potatoes. The Liu'an Special District will also focus on promoting high-yield crops such as potatoes and gaoliang this year.

To ensure the completion of this year's crop conversion task, meetings were held as early as last September to make specific arrangements and discussions. The Anhui Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department dispatched more than 80 people to Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Western Liaoning provinces to purchase high-quality potato seeds. At the same time, it held potato conversion technical training classes to cultivate a group of technical guidance cadres. Subsequently, counties and districts also conducted conversion technical training. According to statistics from the Fuyang Special District alone, more than 5,400 people have been trained. The Suxian Special District also sent people to Shandong to learn gaoliang cultivation methods and bought back more than 1,000 jin of gaoliang seeds. In addition, investigations were conducted in Xujiagang and Suxian to summarize the experience of transplanting sorghum, planting potatoes, and converting to paddy fields.

Farmland water conservancy projects in the paddy field conversion and restoration areas also started in early and mid-March. The construction projects in the Suxian Special District include 11 polders, the excavation of 62 ditches and channels, the digging of 114 ponds, and 20 culverts, with a total earthwork volume of 1.95 million cubic meters. The total earthwork volume of all projects in the Fuyang Special District is 960,000 cubic meters. According to incomplete statistics from Jinzhai, Huoshan, and Shucheng counties in the Liu'an Special District, more than 1,400 mu of terraced fields have been built, and more than 600 mu have been completed by the end of March. To solve the difficulties of poor households in building terraced fields, the Anhui Provincial People's Government issued subsidies of over 1 billion yuan to these three counties.

Currently, farmers in the conversion and restoration areas of Suxian and Fuyang Special Districts are finishing the construction of farmland water conservancy projects. More than 1,700 pieces of conversion farm implements, such as waterwheels and harrows, which the People's Government helped farmers purchase, have also been transported to various places in time to strive for timely planting of rice. More than 25 million jin of potato seeds purchased by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry from Hebei and other provinces have also been mostly transported to rural areas and are about to be planted.

Note: The Huai River basin is an area prone to both floods and droughts. There is very little rainfall in spring and summer, and continuous rain in autumn. Therefore, the hard work of farmers in the Huai River area is often swallowed up by floods and droughts. In order to reduce the threat of drought and flood disasters to agricultural production, the Party and government leading organs of Anhui Province, based on several years of experiments, have decided to implement three reforms in agricultural production in the Huai River basin starting this year: gradually changing the proportion of sown areas for summer and autumn crops; converting to high-yield crops, water-resistant crops, and drought-resistant crops; and changing cultivation methods and the habit of extensive planting and low yield.

    安徽省淮河沿岸宿县阜阳等地
    农作物改种工作正在紧张进行
    安徽省宿县、阜阳等地的农作物改种工作，正在紧张进行。宿县专区今年计划改种和恢复水稻二十万零二千亩，试种马铃薯十万亩，推广糁子、胜利百号山芋一部分。并确定以怀远、五河等县为改种和恢复水稻重点县，宿县、濉溪等县为试种马铃薯重点县。阜阳专区在颍上、阜阳、阜南、临泉等县恢复和改种水稻二万七千多亩，试种马铃薯一万数千亩。六安专区今年也重点推广高产作物马铃薯、糁子等一部分。
    为了保证完成今年的改种任务，早在去年九月，各地就召开会议，作了专门布置和讨论。安徽省人民政府农业厅一面派出八十余人分赴河北、山东、山西、陕西、四川、辽西等省收购马铃薯优良种籽，一面举办改种马铃薯技术训练班，培养了一批技术指导干部。接着，各县、区也都进行改种技术训练，仅据阜阳专区的统计，共已训练了五千四百多人。宿县专区还派人到山东学习栽培糁子的方法，并买回一千多斤糁子种籽。同时，又在徐家港和宿县等地调查总结了移植高粱、种马铃薯和改种水稻的经验。
    改种和恢复水稻地区的农田水利工程也在三月上、中旬先后开工。宿县专区的施工工程计有圩田十一个，开挖沟洫六十二条，挖塘一百一十四个，涵管二十处，土方达一百九十五万公方。阜阳专区全部工程土方共有九十六万公方。六安专区据金寨、霍山、舒城三县不完全统计，共修梯田一千四百多亩，三月底已完成六百多亩。安徽省人民政府为了解决贫困户修梯田的困难，发给该三县补助费十亿余元。
    目前，宿县、阜阳两专区改种和恢复水稻地区的农民正在结束农田水利兴修工程，人民政府帮助农民代办的水车、活耙等改种农具共一千七百多件，也都及时运到各地，争取水稻按时种植。农林厅从河北等省收购的马铃薯种二千五百多万斤，也大部运到农村，即将开始种植。
    按：淮河流域是多涝多旱的地区，春夏雨量特少，秋季霪雨连绵，所以沿淮地区的农民，艰苦劳动的成果常被水旱灾害吞没。安徽省党政领导机关为了减少农业生产中旱涝灾害的威胁，根据几年来的试验，决定从今年起对淮河流域的农业生产实行三项改革工作，这就是：逐步改变夏季和秋季农作物播种面积的比重；改种高产作物，耐水作物和耐旱作物；改变耕作方法和广种薄收的习惯。
