The heroic Vietnamese people are fighting. Their recent continuous victories inspire peace-loving people all over the world. We Chinese people are particularly eager to understand the real situation of every battle and every victory of the Vietnamese people. The recently screened film "Victory in the Northwest" records the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in liberating the Northwest region of Vietnam in the autumn and winter of 1952. This film tells us that the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for the independence of their motherland dealt a heavy blow to the French aggressors in a quarter of the land in northern Vietnam. The film points out to the audience that the war waged by the French aggressors in Vietnam is an unpopular colonial war, and therefore its fate is doomed to failure. Victory belongs to the Vietnamese people!

The Northwest of Vietnam is a rich area where ethnic minorities live, and it is an important strategic base. American imperialism is trying its best to help the French aggressors hold this place, trying to use it as a springboard to attack New China, and then threaten the national liberation movements in Thailand and Burma. At the same time, the French aggressors also wanted to use this to cover their northern defense line in Laos and threaten the neighboring Vietnamese people's liberation areas. The French aggressors implemented a policy of splitting the Vietnamese nation here, and cruelly oppressed and exploited the Vietnamese people. The French aggressors were afraid of the Vietnamese people's resistance activities. In the occupied areas of Northwest Vietnam, they forced the local Vietnamese people to live in concentration villages. People's lives were extremely poor, and they could only fill their stomachs with yams and wild vegetables every day. Some people in some places had not eaten a grain of rice for four whole years. The French aggressors created hunger and death everywhere. The enemy's ferocity did not scare the Vietnamese people. The film vividly shows the invincible strength of the Vietnamese people. Under the close surveillance of the enemy, they protected the cadres of President Ho Chi Minh in carrying out anti-enemy activities. The people were closely united around the cadres, picked up weapons, organized guerrillas, and fought for national independence and freedom.

The people in the Northwest region of Vietnam looked forward day and night to seeing the beloved father and mentor of all ethnic groups in Vietnam—President Ho Chi Minh. They said, "We are like rice seedlings, and the French army is like haze. When will we clear the clouds and see the sun, then we will see President Ho's kind face." They carefully wrapped the photos of President Ho given to them by the cadres in towels, put them in their arms, and close to their hearts. They deeply felt that President Ho was always with them, encouraging and leading them to fight against the invaders. The power of the people is infinite. When the People's Army attacked the enemy in the Northwest region, the Vietnamese people closely followed the troops, and relied on their hands and shoulders to continuously send food and supplies to the soldiers. The Vietnamese people supported the sacred war against aggression in this way.

With the enthusiastic support of the people, the Vietnamese People's Army launched a powerful offensive against the enemy in the Northwest region. They were not afraid of difficulties and dangers, climbed over high mountains and ridges, crossed rivers large and small, and passed through thorny jungles, attacking the enemy day and night. Although the French aggressors had solid fortifications and American-made planes and artillery, they could not stop the victorious advance of the People's Army. They liberated Nghia Lo, Son La, liberated most of the Northwest region of Vietnam, liberated 250,000 Vietnamese people in the Northwest, wiped out more than 6,000 French aggressor troops, and seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition from the enemy. This victory shattered the French colonialists' conspiracy to split the unity of the Vietnamese people, connected the entire Viet Bac liberated area and the Sino-Vietnamese border and the Vietnam-Laos border into one piece, and further enhanced the Vietnamese people's confidence in resisting aggression.

"Victory in the Northwest" truly records this glorious victory of the Vietnamese people, records the shameful defeat of the French aggressors and American interventionists, and records the joy of the people in Northwest Vietnam after liberation. The People's Army entered the newly liberated towns and was warmly welcomed by the local people. People couldn't help but shed tears. An old Thai woman who was blind in both eyes excitedly stroked the face and body of a People's Army soldier, as if she was stroking her own beloved son.

Many displaced people returned to their hometowns and began to rebuild their homes. The people's soldiers tirelessly helped the people restore peaceful life. Some helped the villagers build thatched huts, and some helped the farmers harvest. The army and the people were as close as a family. After tense labor, they sang and danced to their hearts' content and held grand gatherings to celebrate their glorious victory.

The victory of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Northwest is not only of great significance to the Vietnamese people, but also strikes a blow at the American imperialists' conspiracy to use the Northwest of Vietnam as a springboard to invade China. The Vietnamese People's Army is fighting for the national independence and freedom of Vietnam, and is also fighting for the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

    越南人民的胜利
    ——介绍越南民主共和国纪录影片“西北大捷”

    英雄的越南人民在战斗中。他们最近连续不断的胜利，鼓舞着全世界爱好和平的人民。我们中国人民特别渴望着了解越南人民的每一个战斗、每一次胜利的实况。最近放映的影片“西北大捷”，纪录了越南人民军在一九五二年秋、冬季解放越南西北地区的胜利。这部影片告诉我们：越南人民为争取他们祖国的独立而作的英勇斗争，在越南北部的四分之一的土地上，给予法国侵略者以沉重的打击。影片向观众指出：法国侵略者在越南进行的战争，是不得人心的殖民战争，因此注定了它的失败命运。胜利属于越南人民！
    越南西北部是个少数民族聚居的富饶地区，是一个重要的战略基地。美帝国主义竭力援助法国侵略者守住这个地方，想以此作为进攻新中国的跳板，并进而威胁泰国和缅甸的民族解放运动。同时，法国侵略者也想借此掩护他们在寮国的北部防线，威胁邻近的越南人民解放区。法国侵略者，在这里实行分裂越南民族的政策，并对越南人民进行残酷的压迫和榨取。法国侵略者害怕越南人民的抵抗活动，在越南的西北占领区，曾把当地的越南人民逼到集中村居住。人民的生活陷于异常贫困，每天只能以山薯和野菜充饥。有些地方的人民整整四年没有吃过一粒米饭。法国侵略者到处制造饥饿和死亡。敌人的凶残并没有把越南人民吓倒。影片生动地把越南人民不可征服的力量表现出来了。他们在敌人的严密监视下，掩护胡志明主席的干部进行抗敌活动，人民紧紧地团结在干部周围，拿起武器，组织游击队，为争取民族的独立和自由而斗争。
    越南西北地区的人民日日夜夜盼望看到越南各族人民亲爱的父亲和导师——胡志明主席。他们说：“我们好像稻苗，法军好像阴霾，什么时候拨开云雾见太阳，我们就看到了胡主席的慈容。”他们把干部送给他们的胡主席像片，小心翼翼地用手巾包起来，揣在他们的怀里，贴在他们的心上。他们深深感到胡主席永远和他们在一起，鼓舞着，领导着他们向侵略者进行斗争。人民的力量是无穷尽的。当人民军攻击西北地区的敌人时，越南人民紧紧地跟在部队之后，靠双手和肩膀，源源不断地把粮食给养送到战士手中。越南人民就是这样支援着反抗侵略者的神圣战争。
    越南人民军在人民的热烈支援下，在西北地区对敌人展开了强大的攻势。他们不畏艰难危险，爬过高山峻岭，涉过大小河流，穿过棘丛密林，不分昼夜地向敌人攻击。虽然法国侵略者有坚固的工事，有美制的飞机和大炮，但它阻挡不住人民军的胜利前进。他们解放了义路、山萝，解放了越南西北的大部地区，解放了西北的二十五万越南人民，歼灭了六千多法国侵略军，并缴获敌人大量的武器弹药。这次胜利，粉碎了法国殖民者企图分裂越南各族人民团结的阴谋，使整个越北解放区和越中边境、越、寮边境连成了一片，更加提高了越南人民的反侵略的信心。
    “西北大捷”真实地纪录了越南人民这次辉煌的胜利，纪录了法国侵略者和美国干涉者的可耻失败，纪录了越西北人民解放后的喜悦。人民军开进新解放的城镇，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。人们情不自禁地流出眼泪。一个双目失明的泰族老大娘激动地抚摸着一个人民军战士的脸和身子，好像她在抚摸自己亲爱的儿子一样。
    许多流离失所的人民，纷纷回到自己的故乡，开始重建家园。人民的战士，不知疲倦地帮助人民恢复和平生活。有的帮助老乡盖起草屋，有的帮助农民收割，军民亲如一家人。他们在紧张的劳动之后，尽情地歌唱和舞蹈，举行盛大的联欢，庆祝他们的光辉胜利。
    越南人民军在越西北的大捷，不但对于越南人民有重大的意义，而且打击了美帝国主义企图以越西北为跳板来侵略中国的阴谋。越南人民军为越南的民族独立和自由而战，同时也是为远东和全世界的和平事业而战。
