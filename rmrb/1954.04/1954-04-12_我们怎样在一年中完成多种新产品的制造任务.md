    How We Completed the Manufacturing Task of Multiple New Products in One Year
    Wen Yuhe, Director of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant

    In 1953, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant manufactured a total of twenty-nine new products. In addition, it cooperated with brother factories and mines to jointly support key construction projects, manufacturing 154 kinds of various parts and forgings, totaling 23,258 pieces.

    With a wide variety of products and complex specifications, there were few factors for repeated manufacturing of parts, and the accidental variability of temporary tasks was significant. The large variability of products frequently led to imbalances in equipment, labor, production preparation, external procurement of accessories, material supply, raw material workshops and processing workshops, and auxiliary workshops and production workshops, especially imbalances in large machine tools and key equipment. Because the quantity of each product was small, the tools, fixtures and gauges (工卡具) required for parts processing could not be excessive, as this would increase product costs and cause waste. However, without tools, fixtures and gauges, the quality of parts processing could not be guaranteed, leading to long production cycles. At the same time, these situations dictated that the production process required more design technicians, higher technical levels of workers, and higher business levels and stronger organizational capabilities of cadres. These requirements contradicted the current reality of low cadre levels, a shortage of technical personnel, and a relative decline in the technical skills of workers due to the rapid increase in their numbers.

    Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee and with the sincere help of Soviet experts, we vigorously studied advanced Soviet experience and relied on the active efforts of all the plant's employees. Last year, we not only completed the manufacturing tasks of multiple new products and gradually strengthened the enterprise's planned management, but also gained some experience.

    Our first experience was: starting from product design, strive for the greatest possible generalization and standardization of product parts. This involves summarizing the many components with roughly the same functions in the products to be manufactured into several general typical designs and standard parts designs. For example, every machine has parts such as screws, nuts, shafts, tiles, and gears. Unifying the standards of these parts for various machines and implementing standardization and generalization allows these parts to be used on this type of product and also on that type of product. In 1953, we unified the old Japanese and American specifications of various oil pumps into the most advanced Soviet specifications. The advantage of this specification is summer cooling and winter insulation. This saved the design of five hundred types of parts, thus saving the strength of design personnel and also saving material consumption. Part standardization and generalization have many other benefits: it provides favorable conditions for the implementation of specialized division of labor in the workshop, allowing for the adoption of new assembly line-style technological methods for production; reducing the types of parts circulating in the workshop while increasing the quantity of each part, transforming some individual production into small-batch production; some parts can also have insurance reserves; simplifying material preparation and reducing the difficulty of placing external orders; and reducing the formulation of process specifications and tool, fixture and gauge design work. The result is accelerating the production process and ensuring the timely supply of various high-quality new products to the state.

    Our second experience was: adopting the same type of division of labor design and tool, fixture and gauge versatility design in the construction preparation work. For example: various crushers have a frame. To manufacture these frames, many tools, fixtures and gauges are needed. We classified the tools, fixtures and gauges used to manufacture various specifications of crusher frames and prepared them accordingly. Versatile tools, fixtures and gauges are universal tools that can be used to process this part and also to process that part. Last year, we designed and manufactured more than thirty types of special-purpose machine tools and universal tools, fixtures and gauges. Many large parts cannot be processed on ordinary machine tools at all, so we fix them in one place (usually fixing the machine, not the part) and use special tools to process them on the part—using a shaft, tile, wheel, and small motor to transmit power, with a cutting tool installed on one end of the shaft. In this way, special tools can replace heavy machine tools, which is both economical and overcomes the difficulty of insufficient equipment, achieving the goal of spending less money and having a greater effect.

    Our third experience was: relying on the masses of employees and strengthening the technical guidance of work sections. In our factory, two or three (or even more) new products are put into production every month, and only one or two units of these products are required. It is impossible to consider all aspects of drawing design and construction preparation thoroughly before putting them into production, and it is impossible to discover problems through trial production and correct them before putting them into mass production. Therefore, strengthening the technical guidance of work sections and relying on the masses of employees to discover and solve problems in the manufacturing process is a very important task. We assigned a skilled trouble-shooter to serve as the chief foreman of the key work section, and also equipped the work section with technical personnel. Technical personnel and workers jointly studied and improved fifteen types of tools in the manufacturing process, solving key technical problems.

    Our fourth experience was: unifying the strength of departments and workshops, cooperating with each other, and solving problems concretely and in a timely manner. In the trial production process of new products, combined with strengthening planned management, we promoted work plans and organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts. Workshops added planners and dispatchers, and established and improved a series of systems for production organization and management, gradually bringing production and technical management onto the right track. However, because new and old products are put into production at the same time, and thousands of parts are circulated in different types of work processes, if the relevant workshops and departments do not cooperate well, parts often remain stagnant in the work process or workshop due to insufficient supply of tools, fixtures and gauges and materials, or defective workpieces, defective materials, rework, etc., delaying the manufacturing progress of new products. In order to complete the trial production task of new products in a timely manner, starting in October, we organized a new product trial production team headed by the chief engineer, with dedicated personnel responsible for construction, forging, design, planning, production, tooling, inspection, supply and marketing departments, and relevant workshops, with clear division of labor, mutual cooperation, and solving all problems in the trial production process of all new products. The trial production team also specifically grasped the processing progress of important parts for four larger new products, checking them item by item every day, thereby powerfully promoting and accelerating the circulation process of various parts. When the first crusher entered the assembly stage, the team went deep into the construction site to specifically guide the assembly, and immediately studied and solved any technical problems discovered.

    In addition, we also closely organized the work of various departments to do a good job in pre-production preparation; carefully did a good job in the monthly, ten-day, and day-and-night shift work plans in the workshop; and divided joint work sections and joint groups according to the degree of standard parts, so that the work processes could manufacture parts in one work section as much as possible to simplify management procedures. This is an effective method to shorten the production cycle.

    To ensure the completion of the new product trial production plan, it is necessary to strengthen the political education of employees. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has carried out a series of education activities for employees, making employees understand that completing the manufacturing task of new products is to support key engineering construction and gradually realize national industrialization. Educating employees to learn from advanced Soviet experience, promote the concept of the whole, and ensure that the previous work process considers the next work process, and the previous workshop creates convenient conditions for the next workshop, to ensure the completion of the plant's tasks.

    Because we educate employees in departmental work and workshop work, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees, we can constantly overcome the difficulties in new product manufacturing. This year, all employees of our plant must continue to carry forward the spirit of overcoming difficulties last year and manufacture more new machines to accelerate the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

    我们怎样在一年中完成多种新产品的制造任务
    沈阳重型机器厂厂长　温玉和
    沈阳重型机器厂在一九五三年共制造了二十九种新产品，另外配合兄弟厂矿共同支援重点建设工程，制造了各种零件和铸锻件一百五十四种，共二万三千二百五十八件。
    生产的产品品种多，规格复杂，零件重复制造的因素就少，临时任务的意外的变动性就大。而产品变动性大，便经常产生设备、劳动力、生产准备工作、外购配件、材料供应、原材料车间与加工车间、辅助车间与生产车间的不平衡现象，特别是大型机床和关键设备的不平衡现象。由于每一种产品的数量是很少的，部件加工过程中所需要的工卡具就不能过多，多了产品成本就高，造成浪费。但没有工卡具，部件加工的质量就没有保证。生产循环期长。同时，这些情况决定了在生产过程中，需要设计技术人员多，需要工人技术水平高，需要干部业务水平高，组织能力强。这些要求，恰恰与我们目前干部水平低，技术人员缺少、工人因人数迅速增长而技术水平相对降低的实际情况相矛盾。
    我们在上级党委正确领导下，在苏联专家真诚帮助下，大力学习苏联先进经验，依靠全厂职工积极努力，去年不仅完成多种新产品制造任务，逐渐加强了企业的计划管理，并且获得了一些经验。
    我们第一个经验是：从产品设计入手，争取产品零件尽可能地通用化、标准化。这就是把将要制造的产品的许多作用大致相同的部件，归纳成为几种通用的典型设计与标准件设计。如每件机器都有螺丝、螺帽、轴、瓦、齿轮等零件，把各种不同机器这些零件的标准统一起来，实行标准化、通用化，使这些零件可以用在这一种产品上，也可以用在那一种产品上。一九五三年，我们把各种油泵的陈旧的日本式、美国式规格统一为最先进的苏联规格。这种规格的优点是夏季冷却，冬季保温。这样便节省了五百种零件设计，因而节省了设计人员的力量，同时又节省了材料的消耗。零件标准化、通用化还有很多好处：它给车间实行专业分工提供有利的条件，可以采取流水作业式新的工艺方法进行生产；减少车间流转零件的种类而增加每种零件的数量，把部分个别生产变为小批生产；部分零件也可以有保险储备量；简化材料的准备工作，减少对外订货的困难；减少制订工艺规格和工卡具设计工作。其结果是加速生产过程，保证及时地供应国家以各种质量好的新产品。
    我们的第二个经验是：在施工准备工作中采取同类型分工设计和工卡具通用性设计。例如：各种破碎机都有一个架体，为了制造这些架体，需要很多工卡具，我们就把制造各种规格的破碎机架体所用的工卡具加以分类，进行准备。通用性的工卡具，就是万能式的工具，可以用来加工这种部件，也可以用来加工那种部件。去年我们共设计制造了三十余种专用机床和万能性的工卡具。有许多大的部件根本不能在一般机床上加工，我们就把它们固定在一个地方（通常是固定机器，不固定部件），使用专用工具到部件上去进行加工——利用一个轴、瓦、轮、小马达传动，在轴的一端安装切削刀具。这样，专用工具便可以代替重大的机床，又经济又能克服设备不足的困难，做到花钱少、作用大。
    我们的第三个经验是：依靠职工群众，加强工段的技术指导。我们工厂，每一个月都有二、三种
  （或者更多些）新产品在生产，这些产品仅要一、二台。在投入生产前不可能把图纸设计、施工准备等工作都考虑得很周到，又不可能经过试制来发现问题并加以纠正后再大量投入生产。因此，加强工段的技术指导，依靠职工群众在制造过程中发现问题，解决问题，便是一件很重要的工作。我们派了一个找窍门的能手担任关键工段总工长，并在工段配备了技术人员。技术人员与工人在制造过程中共同研究改进了十五种工具，解决了关键的技术问题。
    我们的第四个经验是：统一科室、车间力量，共同配合，及时地具体解决问题。我们在新产品试制过程中，结合加强计划管理，推行作业计划，按指示图表组织有节奏生产。车间增设了计划员、调度员，建立和健全了生产组织管理上一系列的制度，使生产技术管理逐步纳入正轨。但是，由于新旧产品同时投入生产，千百种部件在不同工种的工序中流转，如果有关车间、科室配合不同，部件往往因为工卡具及材料的供应不及或工废料废、返修回用等，迟滞停留在工序或车间里，而推迟了新产品的制造进度。我们为了及时完成新产品试制任务，从十月份开始以主任工程师为首，组织了新产品试制小组，施工、锻冶、设计、计划、生产、工具、检查、供销等科与有关车间都有专人负责，明确分工，互相配合，解决所有新产品试造过程中的一切问题。试制小组并具体掌握四种较大的新产品，每天逐件检查重要部件的加工进度，因而有力地推动和加速了各种部件的流转过程。第一台破碎机进入装配阶段时，小组深入工地具体指导装配，发现技术问题立即研究解决。
    此外，我们还把各科室工作密切组织起来，做好生产前的准备工作；在车间里认真做好月的、旬的和昼夜班的作业计划；并根据标准零件的多寡程度划分联合工段、联合小组，使工序之间尽可能在一个工段制造出零件来，简化管理手续。这是缩短生产周期的有效方法。
    要保证新产品试制计划的完成，必须加强对职工的政治教育。沈阳重型机器厂在党委的统一领导下，曾对职工进行了一系列的教育，使职工懂得完成新产品制造任务，就是支援重点工程建设和逐步实现国家工业化。教育职工学习苏联先进经验，发扬整体观念，做到上一道工序给下一道工序打算，上一个车间给下一个车间创造便利的条件，保证全厂任务的完成。
    由于我们在科室工作、车间工作中教育职工，发挥职工群众的积极性与创造性，才能不断地克服新产品制造中的困难。今年，我们全厂职工一定要继续发扬去年克服困难的精神，为加速祖国社会主义工业化制造更多的新机器。
