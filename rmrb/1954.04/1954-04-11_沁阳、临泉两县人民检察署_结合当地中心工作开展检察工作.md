The People's Procuratorates of Qinyang County, Henan Province, and Linquan County, Anhui Province, closely integrated their procuratorial work with the local central tasks in 1953, and investigated and handled a number of cases of violations of law and discipline. According to the statistics of the Linquan County People's Procuratorate, they accepted a total of 351 cases of various types throughout the year, of which 39 were investigated and handled as special cases. The investigation and handling of these cases protected the people's democratic rights and played a certain role in promoting the smooth progress of the central tasks.

The People's Procuratorates of these two counties can proactively and actively conduct investigations and research whenever a central task arrives, formulate work plans based on the actual situation, and, after submitting them to the local Party and government leading organs for approval, focus on key cases for investigation and handling in a planned and focused manner. This is the main reason why the people's procuratorial work in the two places has been able to achieve results. For example, in the spring of last year, Qinyang and Linquan counties both suffered from frost damage, and production and disaster relief became the central task at that time. However, bad elements took the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities, and grain speculators also frantically purchased and hoarded grain. After the Qinyang County People's Procuratorate received the unified work deployment from the local Party and government leading organs, it immediately held a business meeting to study and determine that the focus of the procuratorial work was: to supervise and inspect whether there were any violations of national policies and laws in social relief work; to investigate the sabotage activities of speculators and counter-revolutionary elements. After this work opinion was approved by the county's Party and government leading organs, the deputy procurator of the county People's Procuratorate went to Chongyi Town in the fifth district, where there were more problems, and found that the peasants were not very enthusiastic about fighting the disaster and protecting the seedlings, but were busy buying and hoarding grain. However, the local cooperative and grain station had a large stock of grain, and the grain supply was fully guaranteed. The occurrence of the hoarding phenomenon was obviously not justified. After the procuratorial cadres conducted in-depth investigation and research, they found that this abnormal phenomenon was mainly caused by grain speculators buying and hoarding grain, and the local First Exchange was highly suspected. With the close cooperation of the county Grain Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Section, they quickly investigated and verified the criminal behavior of Yang Xianfu, the manager of the exchange, and others, and filed a public prosecution with the county People's Court. The county People's Court convened a mass public trial attended by merchants and vendors from Chongyi Town and representatives from nine towns and twenty-two administrative villages. Yang Xianfu was sentenced to two years of imprisonment on the spot, and other criminals were sentenced to labor reform or fines. At the same time, the county People's Procuratorate also applied to the county People's Government to commend Yang Chunfu, the accountant of the exchange, who was honest, law-abiding, and actively reported criminal elements. The high-profile handling of this case not only played a positive role in stabilizing grain prices and reassuring the people in Qinyang County, but also had a good impact on the nearby Meng County and Wen County. At the same time, the Linquan County People's Procuratorate also sent personnel to investigate and study the social situation, and based on the reports of the People's Procuratorial Correspondents, inspected the cases of Hu Guobao, an illegal grain merchant in Hongzhuang District, hoarding grain, selling at high prices, and disrupting the grain market, as well as the conspiracy of bad elements such as Wang Guochang to sabotage. Hu and others were arrested and handed over to the judicial organs for punishment according to law, and extensive publicity was carried out through the county's blackboard newspapers, which also played a good role in stabilizing social order and ensuring the smooth progress of production and disaster relief work.

During last year's "New Three-Anti" struggle, these two county's People's Procuratorates actively and proactively cooperated with relevant organs to inspect and handle a batch of major cases among cases improperly inspected and handled by judicial and public security organs, especially in the state's unified purchase and sale of grain. The Linquan County People's Procuratorate investigated and handled twenty major cases of violations of law and discipline and five cases of sabotaging the unified purchase of grain. Qinyang County alone successively uncovered three major cases of violations of law and discipline in Xiwantown in the Second District: the theft of the Xiwantown Cooperative, the violations of law and discipline by manager Chang Youde and others; the serious bureaucracy of the Danhe Canal Administration, forcing the people to pay water fees regardless of their hardships; and the destruction of people's graves and farmland by the Second District in leading the people to dig canals and dredge rivers regardless of the people's opposition. These cases had caused considerable negative impact among the masses. After verifying the facts, the county People's Procuratorate immediately reported to the Party and government leading organs for serious handling.

While investigating the above-mentioned cases, the People's Procuratorates of these two counties also paid attention to supervising the correct implementation of policies and laws. During last year's grain purchase work, the Linquan County People's Procuratorate dispatched inspection teams to investigate and study the deviations in the implementation of policies in a few places, and reported to the Party and government leading organs for timely handling. For example, in Qiwancun Village, Ronglou Township, Wangzhai District, Qi Mingru, a militiaman, and others illegally forced the surrender of surplus grain and beat Li Fengshi, a military family member, and her three children. The township head covered up the facts and did not report them. After People's Procuratorial Correspondent Dong Weisheng exposed the case, the county People's Procuratorate investigated and verified the facts, arrested Qi Mingru and brought him to justice, and suggested that the higher-level People's Government dismiss the township head. The CPC Linquan County Committee circulated this incident to various places, ordering them to prevent the occurrence of similar violations of law and discipline. In last year's campaign to implement the Marriage Law, the Qinyang County People's Procuratorate found that some leading cadres of the county Women's Federation had deviations in their understanding of policies and mistakenly proposed when deploying work to lower-level Women's Federations: the campaign to implement the Marriage Law should be the same as the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries" movement. As a result, cadres of the District Women's Federation mistakenly emphasized the punitive aspect in their propaganda, which caused anxiety and led to suicides due to male-female relationships. The county People's Procuratorate immediately reported these situations to the Party and government leading organs and took emergency measures to correct the deviations, which played a positive role in the correct development of the campaign to implement the Marriage Law.

Because the People's Procuratorates of these two counties were able to closely integrate their procuratorial work with the central tasks and achieved certain results, they were generally welcomed and supported by the masses and aroused the attention of the Party and government leading organs to the procuratorial work. For example, after the Linquan County People's Procuratorate handled the case of Li Yucai, a cadre of Huaji District, and others severely infringing on human rights and extorting confessions by torture, not only did the phenomena of violations of law and discipline significantly decrease, but the prestige of the People's Procuratorate was also enhanced. At the eleventh second session of the People's Congress of the county last year, more than seventy proposals indicated that the procuratorate should handle them. The Party and government leading organs of these two counties also paid more attention to the People's Procuratorial work and strengthened their leadership over it, which provided extremely favorable conditions for the development of the procuratorial work. For example, when the Qinyang County People's Procuratorate handled the three cases of violations of law and discipline in Xiwantown, Second District, last year, the county Party secretary personally presided over the meeting. When handling the case of bad element Gu Taifu and others inciting the masses to dig dikes and destroy water conservancy facilities in July last year, the county magistrate also personally presided over the meeting. After the summer harvest last year, grain speculators in Qinyang County rushed to buy wheat, which affected the completion of the state's purchase task. After research and analysis, the county People's Procuratorate reported to the county's Party and government leaders, and the county Party committee instructed the district Party committee to specifically help the procuratorate carry out this work, so that the procuratorate achieved remarkable results in opposing the speculative activities of grain merchants. In the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, the county Party committee designated the procuratorate as the main body, and jointly formed an inspection team with the Public Security Bureau, the People's Court, the Supervisory Committee, the Industry and Commerce Section, and the Grain Bureau. These facts show that the People's Procuratorates of these two counties have become powerful assistants to the Party and government organs in the struggle against violations of law and discipline.

The reason why the People's Procuratorial work in these two counties has achieved the above-mentioned results is certainly due to their ability to actively and proactively serve the central tasks, and to seize the investigation and handling of major typical cases to expand the publicity of law and discipline, and mobilize cadres and the masses to work hard to complete the work tasks, but at the same time, it is also inseparable from their emphasis on the work of People's Procuratorial Correspondents. For example, the Linquan County People's Procuratorate not only held a meeting of Procuratorial Correspondents to summarize the work of Procuratorial Correspondents in 1952; but also established a meeting and reporting system based on the suggestions of the Procuratorial Correspondents, and assigned them different tasks according to different business natures. Therefore, they were able to report situations in a timely manner and report seven major cases of violations of law and discipline, becoming powerful ears and eyes and assistants of the People's Procuratorial organs.

    沁阳、临泉两县人民检察署
    结合当地中心工作开展检察工作
    河南省沁阳县和安徽省临泉县人民检察署，在一九五三年内密切结合当地中心工作，检察处理了一批违法乱纪案件。据临泉县人民检察署统计，他们全年共受理了各种案件三百五十一起，其中有三十九起作了专案检察和处理。这些案件的检察和处理，保护了人民的民主权利，对于推动中心工作的顺利进行起了一定的作用。
    这两个县的人民检察署，在每一项中心工作到来后，都能主动积极地进行调查研究，根据实际情况拟订工作计划，报请当地党政领导机关批准后，有计划有重点地抓住典型案件进行检察处理。这是两地人民检察工作能够做出成绩的主要原因。例如去年春季，沁阳和临泉两县都遭受霜灾，生产救灾成了当时的中心工作，但坏分子却乘机进行破坏活动，粮食奸商也大肆抢购和套购粮食。沁阳县人民检察署在当地党政领导机关统一布置工作任务后，立即召开了业务会议，研究确定了检察工作的重点是：监督和检察社会救济工作中是否有违反国家政策法令的行为；追究奸商和反革命分子的破坏活动。这一工作意见经县的党政领导机关同意后，县人民检察署副检察长便深入到问题较多的第五区崇义镇，发现农民对于抗灾保苗的劲头不大，反忙于争购、抢购粮食，而该区合作社和粮站都备有大批粮食，粮食供应完全有保证，抢购现象的发生显然是不应该的。经检察干部深入调查研究后发现，这一反常现象主要是粮食奸商抢购、套购粮食所引起的，而当地第一交易所又有很大的嫌疑。他们在县粮食局和工商科的密切配合之下，迅速调查证实了交易所经理杨宪富等的犯罪行为，向县人民法院提起了公诉。县人民法院召开了以崇义镇的坐商、摊贩为主并有九个镇、二十二个行政村代表参加的群众公审大会，当场判处了杨犯宪富有期徒刑两年，其他各犯分别判处了劳动改造或罚款。同时县人民检察署又申请县人民政府表扬了廉洁守法、积极检举犯罪分子的交易所会计杨春富。这一案件大张旗鼓地处理后，不仅在沁阳县境内对稳定当时的粮价、安定人心起了积极的作用，而且对附近的孟县和温县都发生了良好的影响。与此同时，临泉县人民检察署也派员调查研究了社会情况，并根据人民检察通讯员的反映，检察了洪庄区不法粮商胡国保套购粮食、高价贩卖、捣乱粮食市场以及坏分子王国昌等阴谋破坏等案件，将胡犯等逮捕交司法机关依法惩办，并通过全县的黑板报作了广泛的宣传，对于安定社会秩序、保障生产救灾工作的顺利进行也起了良好的作用。
    这两个县的人民检察署在去年的“新三反”斗争中，在司法、公安机关检查处理不当的案件中，特别是在国家的粮食统购统销工作中，都积极主动地协同有关机关检查处理了一批重大的案件。临泉县人民检察署查处了重大的违法乱纪案二十件、破坏粮食统购案五件。沁阳县仅在二区西万镇就连续查出了三件重大违法乱纪案：西万镇合作社被盗、经理常有德等违法乱纪案；丹河渠道管理局严重官僚主义、不顾群众疾苦逼交水费案；二区在领导群众挖渠整理河道工程中不顾群众反对、挖毁群众坟墓和田地案。这些案件曾在群众中造成相当恶劣的影响，县人民检察署在查实情况后，立即报请党政领导机关作了严肃的处理。
    在检查上述案件的同时，这两个县的人民检察署还注意了监督政策法令的正确贯彻执行。在去年的粮食收购工作中，临泉县人民检察署就曾派出检查组，调查研究了少数地方在执行政策中的偏差，汇报党政领导机关作了及时的处理。如该县王寨区荣楼乡齐湾村民兵齐明儒等非法追挤余粮，吊打军属李冯氏母子三人，而该乡乡长反而掩盖事实真象，不往上汇报。经人民检察通讯员董维生揭发，县人民检察署查明事实后，将齐明儒逮捕法办，并建议上级人民政府将乡长撤职。中共临泉县委会曾将这件事情通报各地，责成他们防止类似违法乱纪事件的发生。在去年的贯彻婚姻法运动中，沁阳县人民检察署发现县妇联的某些领导干部对政策的认识有偏差，在给下级妇联布置工作时错误地提出：贯彻婚姻法运动要和“镇反”运动一样。结果区妇联的干部在宣传时错误地强调了惩罚的一面，因而人心不安，并造成了因男女关系而自杀的事件。县人民检察署立即把这些情况汇报给党政领导机关，采取了紧急措施，纠正了偏向，对贯彻婚姻法运动的正确开展起了积极的作用。
    由于这两个县的人民检察署能够密切结合中心工作开展检察业务，获得了一定的成绩，因而普遍受到群众的欢迎和拥护，引起了党政领导机关对检察工作的重视。如临泉县人民检察署在处理滑集区干部李玉才等严重侵犯人权刑讯逼供的案件后，不仅违法乱纪现象显著减少，而且提高了人民检察署的威信，在去年该县第十一届第二次人民代表会议上，就有七十多个提案注明要检察署处理。这两个县的党政领导机关也更加重视人民检察工作，加强了对它的领导，这就为检察工作的开展提供了极其有利的条件。如去年沁阳县人民检察署在处理二区西万镇的三件违法乱纪案时，县委书记亲往主持。在去年七月处理煽动群众扒堤破坏水利设施的坏分子谷太富等一案时，县长也曾亲往主持。去年夏收后，沁阳县粮食奸商抢购小麦，影响国家收购任务的完成。县人民检察署经过研究分析，向县的党政领导方面作了汇报，县委责成区委具体帮助检察署开展这一工作，因而使检察署在反对粮商的投机倒把行为方面取得了显著成绩。在粮食统购统销工作中，县委又指定以检察署为主，和公安局、人民法院、监委、工商科、粮食局等共同组成检查组。这些事实说明：这两个县的人民检察署已经成为党政机关反对违法乱纪斗争的有力助手。
    这两个县的人民检察工作所以取得上述成绩，固然是由于他们能够积极主动地为中心工作服务，并抓住重大典型案件的检查处理来扩大法纪的宣传，动员干部和群众为完成工作任务而努力，但同时也是和他们重视人民检察通讯员工作分不开的。如临泉县人民检察署不仅召开过检察通讯员会议，总结了一九五二年的检察通讯员工作；而且还根据检察通讯员的建议，建立了会议、汇报制度，并依据不同的业务性质，给他们布置不同的任务。因此他们能够及时反映情况，检举了重大的违法乱纪案件七件，成为人民检察机关的有力耳目和助手。
