People and public opinion in various countries have called for a negotiated solution to pressing Asian issues and opposed the US plot to expand intervention in the Indochina War.

    Vietnam
    The Vietnamese "Independence News" recently published a commentary condemning the US conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference. The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the Geneva Conference was to resolve urgent Asian issues, mainly the Korean and Indochina issues, through consultation to ease international tensions. Just as the people of Asia and the world were looking forward to the success of the conference, the United States was stepping up its activities to undermine it. The United States is instigating the Lee Seung-man clique to actively obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue. The United States is intensifying its intervention in the Indochina War, coercing the French colonialists to continue the war. The United States and Japan signed an agreement aimed at promoting Japanese rearmament, and are stepping up the establishment of military bases in the Philippines and Thailand. These actions by the United States in Korea, Indochina and other parts of Asia show that the United States is conspiring to undermine the Geneva Conference and prevent the easing of tensions in Asia and the world.
     India
    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorialized on the 12th: Dulles said in Washington that he wanted to "create the necessary conditions to ensure that the Geneva Conference does not lead to the loss of freedom in Southeast Asia." The editorial said: "For him, 'freedom' means not allowing the establishment of a communist regime. Does South Korea enjoy freedom under Lee Seung-man's autocracy? Does consolidating French rule in Indochina mean freedom for the people of that country? Of course, Dulles would inevitably answer 'yes' to these simple questions. But at least in Asia, few would agree with him. For Asian countries, the word 'freedom' has an ancient meaning." The editorial asked: "Why should any country have to give up its inherent right to choose its own government just because the government of another country dislikes a certain ideology?"
    The "Assam Tribune" editorial on the 10th criticized Dulles' proposal to take joint action to interfere in the Indochina War. The editorial said: "Given that the Geneva Five-Power Conference including China will be held on April 26, all peace-loving people in the world denounce Dulles' activities as the most untimely. Judging from Dulles' bizarre actions, he seems to be trying to prevent the problem from being resolved peacefully. Dulles' attempt to sabotage in advance the first international conference in which representatives of the People's Republic of China will participate together with representatives of the United States, Britain and France, only tore off the masks of those American politicians who talk about peace but act to harm peace." The editorial then pointed out: "Dulles claims that the United States hopes to maintain the territorial integrity of the region. This means that the local people of Indochina are not given the right to self-determination, but France is supported in dominating the region." The editorial said: "This is absolutely harmful to the cause of world peace."
    The "Hindu" editorial on the 10th condemned Dulles for "sabotaging the Geneva Conference before it was held."
      The "Hindustan Times" said in its editorial on the 10th, referring to Dulles' trip to London and Paris: "It is amazing that the United States is forcing big countries to follow suit and submit to its dictates."
    The "Organiser" weekly editorial on April 12 said: "Dulles' recent remarks on the situation in Indochina are not a very reassuring proof that he loves peace." The editorial ridiculed Dulles' slanderous and threatening remarks against China, saying: "It is strange that these threats come from the mouth of a person who sends American planes and experts to Indochina to fight desperately."
    Pakistan
    The "Pakistan Times" said in an editorial on the 10th entitled "America Against Freedom": "The new conspiracy of the United States to invite the ANZUS countries, Britain, France and certain Asian countries to guarantee in advance support for possible actions by the United States in Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam, shows that the United States wants to internationalize the war and undermine the upcoming Geneva Conference, causing irreparable damage to the prospect of a peaceful settlement in that region."
    The Lahore "Today" editorial on the 11th said: "The United States hopes to turn Indochina into a second Korea. In this Indochina war, not only France is a participant, but the United States is also a participant. Although it is French soldiers who are dying, the weapons and ammunition are all supplied by the United States. But even such assistance seems to have failed, and the French imperialists are retreating. Therefore, the United States is now一心希望 (yīxīn xīwàng, wholeheartedly hoping) to intervene directly, but as in Korea, it wants to drag its allies into this war." The editorial criticized the US conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Conference, saying: "It should be pointed out that the Five-Power Conference (United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China) will soon be held in Geneva to discuss the Indochina issue. But the leaders of the United States are beginning to predict the failure of the Geneva Conference before the conference is held." The editorial said: "Eisenhower said that the United States cannot lose Indochina under any circumstances. This alone shows the United States' conspiracy in Indochina. The United States not only hopes to dominate French imperialists in Indochina, but also hopes to replace French imperialists in that region."

    各国人民要求协商解决亚洲问题  反对美国扩大干预印度支那战争
    各国人民和舆论纷纷要求以协商方式解决亚洲的迫切问题，反对美国扩大干预印度支那战争的策划。
    越南
    越南“独立报”最近一期发表评论，谴责美国阴谋破坏日内瓦会议。评论指出，日内瓦会议的目的是以协商方式来解决亚洲的迫切问题，主要是朝鲜和印度支那问题，以缓和国际紧张局势。正当亚洲及世界人民都盼望会议获得成功的时候，美国却在加紧进行破坏这个会议的活动。美国正在唆使李承晚集团积极阻挠朝鲜问题的解决。美国正在加紧干涉印度支那战争，胁迫法国殖民者继续进行这个战争。美国和日本签订了旨在推进日本重新武装的协定，并在菲律宾和泰国加紧建立军事基地。美国目前在朝鲜、印度支那及亚洲其他地方的这些行动，都说明美国阴谋破坏日内瓦会议，阻止亚洲及世界紧张局势的缓和。
     印度
    “甘露市场报”十二日社论说：杜勒斯曾在华盛顿说过，要“创造必要条件以保证日内瓦会议不会导致东南亚丧失自由”。社论说：“对他来说，‘自由’的意思是不准建立共产党政权。难道南朝鲜在李承晚的专制之下享有自由吗？难道巩固法国在印度支那的统治，就意味着该国人民的自由吗？当然，对于这些简单明了的问题，杜勒斯必然会回答说‘是的’。但是，至少在亚洲，很少会有人同意他的意见。对亚洲国家来说，‘自由’这两个字，具有自古即然的含义。”社论问道：“任何国家为什么只是为了另外一个国家的政府不喜欢某一种意识形态，就必须放弃它固有的选择自己政府的权利呢？”
    “阿萨姆论坛报”十日社论斥责杜勒斯主张采取联合行动以干涉印度支那战争的建议。社论说：“鉴于包括中国在内的日内瓦五大国会议将在四月二十六日召开，全世界爱好和平的人们都斥责杜勒斯的活动为最不合时宜的活动。由杜勒斯的稀奇古怪的作法看来，他似乎在努力使这个问题不要得到和平解决。杜勒斯企图事先破坏中华人民共和国的代表第一次和美、英、法代表一起参加的国际会议，只是扯下了那些嘴里说要和平而行动上却损害和平的利益的美国政客们的假面具。”社论接着指出：“杜勒斯声称，美国希望保持该地区的领土完整。这意味着，不给印度支那当地人民以自决权，而支持法国在该地区称王称霸。”社论说：“这是绝对有害于世界和平事业的。”
    “印度教徒报”十日社论谴责杜勒斯“在日内瓦会议没有举行以前就对这个会议横加破坏”。
      “印度文汇报”在十日社论中提到杜勒斯的伦敦与巴黎之行时说：“美国竟然强迫大国随它亦步亦趋和俯首听命，这实在是令人惊异的事。”
    四月十二日的“组织家”周刊社论说：“杜勒斯最近发表的关于印度支那局势的言论，并不是足以表明他爱好和平的非常令人安心的证明。”社论讥刺杜勒斯诬蔑和威胁中国的言论说：“这些威胁之词出自把美国飞机与专家送到印度支那去拼命干的人之口，这是奇怪的事。”
    巴基斯坦
    “巴基斯坦时报”十日在题为“美国反对自由”的社论中说：“美国邀请澳、新、美集团国家、英国、法国和某些亚洲国家在事先保证支持美国可能在东南亚尤其是在越南采取的行动，这种新的阴谋表明美国想使战争国际化，破坏即将召开的日内瓦会议，使得在那个地区实行和平解决的前景受到无可补救的损害。”
    拉合尔的“今天报”十一日社论说：“美国希望把印度支那变成第二个朝鲜。在这场印度支那战争里，不仅法国是参加者，而且美国也同样是参加者。虽然送死的是法国士兵，但是武器和弹药都是美国供给的。不过纵然是这样的援助似乎也已失败，法帝国主义者在退却。因此，美国现在一心希望直接干涉，但是像在朝鲜一样，它又希望把它的盟友拖进这场战争里。”社论斥责美国破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋说：“应该指出：五大国（美国、苏联、英国、法国与中国）会议不久就要在日内瓦召开来讨论印度支那问题。但是美国的领袖们正在会议召开以前开始预言日内瓦会议将要失败。”社论说：“艾森豪威尔说过美国在任何情况下都不能失掉印度支那。仅仅这一点就已经表明美国在印度支那的阴谋。美国不仅希望在印度支那支配法帝国主义者，而且希望在那个地区代替法帝国主义者。”
