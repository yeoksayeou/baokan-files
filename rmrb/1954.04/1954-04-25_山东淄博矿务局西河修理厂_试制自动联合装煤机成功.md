    Xihu Repair Shop of Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province
    Successfully Trial-Manufactures Automatic Combined Coal Loading Machine
    The Xihu Repair Shop of the Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province has successfully trial-manufactured an automatic combined coal loading machine. One automatic combined coal loading machine can load 250 tons of coal per hour.
    The machine weighs more than five tons. Given the shop's equipment capacity and technical level, it was very difficult to trial-manufacture such a heavy machine, but the workers in the shop displayed their creative wisdom and overcame various difficulties. When processing the machine's drum, the shop didn't have a tool for this kind of work. Wang Zhikun, the leader of the fitter team, devised a "fixture" and processed it on a shaper, which not only completed the task but also achieved the standard in quality. After the machine was assembled, the initial test loading volume was low, only 150 tons of coal per hour. The fitter Sun Dapu then came up with the idea of installing coal digging wings on the coal digging groove to increase the coal digging volume. The worker Sun Daiming also suggested adding baffles to the drum so that the locomotive could clear the coal path itself when it started. The worker Ma Xingche found a way to add railway sandpipes to reduce the slipperiness of the railway and ensure normal and safe operation.
    The successful trial-manufacture of this automatic combined coal loading machine has greatly reduced the physical labor of the coal loaders. In the past, manual loading could only load two tons per person per hour. With the machine, only two or three workers are needed to operate the electrical switches, and a dozen or so workers are responsible for digging coal, pushing carts, and clearing the road. Two hundred and fifty tons can be loaded in an hour, so the cost per ton of coal can be reduced by 3,840 yuan.

    试制自动联合装煤机成功
    山东省淄博矿务局西河修理厂试制自动联合装煤机成功。一部自动联合装煤机每小时可装二百五十吨煤。
    这部机器有五吨多重，按该厂的设备能力和技术水平，试制这样重型的机器，是有很多困难的，但该厂工人发挥了创造智慧，克服了各种困难。加工这部机器的滚筒时，厂里没有加工这种活的工具，钳工组组长王至坤想办法做了一个“卡具”，在牛头刨上加工，不但完成了任务，而且质量也达到了标准。这部机器装成后，在初次试机时，扒装量低，每小时仅能装一百五十吨煤，钳工孙大朴便想法在扒煤槽上安装扒煤翅子，提高了扒煤量。工人孙岱明又提出在滚筒上加设档板，机车开动时，便能自己扫清煤路。工人马兴车想办法增添了铁路沙管子，减少了铁路的滑度，保证了正常安全运转。
    这部自动联合装煤机的试制成功，大大减轻了装煤工人的体力劳动，过去用人工装车，每人每小时只能装两吨，用机器只用两三个工人操纵电器开关，有十几个工人负责扒煤、推车、清路等工作，一小时就可装二百五十吨，因而每吨煤的成本可降低三千八百四十元。
