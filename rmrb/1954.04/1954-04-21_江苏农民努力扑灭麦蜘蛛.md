Jiangsu farmers are working hard to eradicate wheat spider mites, which have spread in some areas of Jiangsu Province. Party and government leaders at all levels are actively mobilizing the masses to vigorously eliminate them.

The CPC Yangzhou Prefectural Committee made specific arrangements for prevention and control work at a meeting of county party secretaries, and decided to allocate 200,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder to support farmers in eradicating wheat spider mites. The CPC Liuhe County Committee drew cadres from county-level organizations to form three pest control work teams, which went to seriously affected areas such as Wangzi, the outskirts of the city, and Getang to assist in carrying out prevention and control. When mobilizing farmers to eliminate wheat spider mites, leaders in various places relied on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to set an example, driving the vast number of farmers to invest in the pest control movement. Some places even launched pest control competitions. The Changjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dapeng Township, Jiangning County, and the 52 mutual aid teams in the township, under the leadership of the Party branch, launched a rotating red flag competition to eliminate wheat spider mites. Under the influence of the leading cooperative and mutual aid teams, farmers throughout the township have enthusiastically engaged in pest control work. In many places, wheat seedlings have turned from withered yellow to green after the wheat spider mites were eliminated.

    江苏农民努力扑灭麦蜘蛛
    江苏省麦田害虫麦蜘蛛已在部分地区蔓延起来，各地党政领导上正积极发动群众大力扑灭。
    中共扬州地委在县委书记会议上具体布置了防治工作，并决定拨出二十万斤“六六六”药粉支援农民扑灭麦蜘蛛。中共六合县委从县级机关抽调干部组成三个灭虫工作组，分头到王子、城郊、葛塘等虫害严重地区协助开展防治工作。在发动农民扑灭麦蜘蛛时，各地领导方面都依靠互助合作组织做出样子，带动广大农民投入灭虫运动，有的地方还开展了灭虫竞赛。江宁县大棚乡长江农业生产合作社和全乡五十二个互助组在党支部领导下，展开了扑灭麦蜘蛛的循环红旗竞赛，在合作社和互助组带头影响下，全乡农民已热烈投入灭虫工作。许多地方麦苗在麦蜘蛛扑灭后已由萎黄转青。
