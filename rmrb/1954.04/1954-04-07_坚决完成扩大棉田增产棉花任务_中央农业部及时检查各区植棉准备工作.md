    Resolutely Complete the Task of Expanding Cotton Fields and Increasing Cotton Production
    Central Ministry of Agriculture Timely Inspects Cotton Planting Preparation Work in Various Regions
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 6th] The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture, in order to help and promote the resolution of current work issues in various cotton-producing areas, convened a cotton planting preparation work report meeting from March 17th to 20th. More than ten representatives from the agricultural departments of North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, Northeast, and provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi attended the meeting.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Li Shu-cheng, Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture, expounded on the importance of completing this year's cotton planting task. Subsequently, representatives from various regions reported on the cotton planting preparation situation and展开讨论on the problems existing in cotton planting. Vice Minister Yang Xian-dong gave a report on how to improve cotton planting technology.
    Based on the reports and discussions of representatives from various regions, the meeting concluded that as long as everyone makes a little more effort, the country's cotton planting plan for this year can be completed. In order to adapt to the development of the national textile industry and meet the needs of civilian cotton wadding, all regions should resolutely complete this year's task of expanding cotton fields and increasing cotton production. Increasing grain production is the primary task on the current agricultural production front, but a comprehensive arrangement must be made for both grain and cotton production increases. Generally, it is correct for all regions to emphasize publicizing increasing grain production to support national construction, but in cotton-suitable areas, it must be emphasized that increasing cotton production is also a contribution to national industrialization.
    The meeting concluded that all cotton-producing areas must vigorously publicize the country's general line during the transition period, help farmers understand the benefits of socialist industrialization; publicize the cotton-grain price ratio policy, conduct detailed calculations, and combine the personal interests of farmers with the national interests; publicize the policy of planned purchase and supply of grain, educate farmers not to worry about not being able to buy grain; and publicize the cotton pre-purchase policy and the policy that cotton can be used to pay public grain, etc., to guide farmers to consciously and voluntarily plant cotton in accordance with the national plan.
    Yang Xian-dong said in his report: Not only must we ensure the completion of the task of expanding cotton fields, but we must also ensure the completion of the task of increasing yield per unit area. Therefore, all regions must vigorously carry out technical instruction work, and in accordance with the different situations in different regions, achieve seed protection, seedling protection, increased fertilization, pest and disease control, and improved cultivation techniques.
    [Xinhua News Agency, April 6th] Farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country are making preparations for cotton planting in accordance with the national plan to support the national textile industry and meet the needs of the people. According to the situation in North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, and Northeast regions, all cotton-producing areas can complete the cotton planting task as planned as long as they make a little more effort. Jiangsu Province, due to the bumper cotton harvest last year, farmers have a high enthusiasm for cotton planting. Farmers in the salt reclamation area are actively reclaiming wasteland for cotton planting, and the province's cotton planting plan can be overfulfilled.
    This year, after the publicity of the country's general line during the transition period and the worker-peasant alliance in various cotton-producing areas, the farmers' production enthusiasm is very high. However, some farmers also have some concerns about expanding the cotton planting area. For example, some farmers in the Liaocheng Special Area of Shandong Province were once afraid that they would not be able to buy grain after planting more cotton and that livestock would not have grass to eat; some were also afraid of insect pests and floods, and the cotton harvest was not guaranteed, and that cotton was not as profitable as peanuts and sweet potatoes. In response to this situation, the Party and government leading organs at all levels in Liaocheng Special Area continued to thoroughly publicize the country's general line during the transition period and the worker-peasant alliance at various meetings, publicize policies such as increasing the grain-cotton price ratio this year, and conduct specific detailed calculations; at the same time, they paid attention to promoting cotton planting technology, leading farmers to universally harrow spring land, prevent drought and conserve soil moisture, and accumulate a large amount of coarse fertilizer and select and replace cotton seeds. In this way, farmers throughout the special area consciously and voluntarily revised their plans to increase cotton planting, which is expected to exceed the original plan of 2.35 million mu by 20,000 mu. In Mancheng County, Hebei Province, the task of expanding cotton fields was first discussed at the county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings, the representative conference of agricultural production cooperatives, and the mutual aid group leader training class. Subsequently, the county and district levels selected 239 cadres to form work teams to go to the countryside to widely publicize the country's general line during the transition period and various policies related to cotton planting, and used various facts to dispel farmers' concerns, and the grain departments appropriately increased the number of grain sales points in rural areas and simplified grain purchase procedures, and the farmers in the county revised the cotton planting plan. At present, among the 264 agricultural production cooperatives in the county, 195 cooperatives have revised their plans, and the total area of cotton planting will be expanded by 33% compared to last year according to the national plan. In Wugong, Jingyang, Chang'an, Chengcheng, Dali, Baocheng and other counties in Shaanxi Province, after launching publicity and mobilization, many farmers changed the land prepared for planting gourds, vegetables, and sweet potatoes to cotton, in order to maintain the original cotton planting area as required by the plan.
    Various cotton-producing areas have prepared a large amount of cotton seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides early to supply to farmers. Hebei Province has prepared 40 million catties of cotton seeds; the province plans to supply nearly 1 billion catties of commercial fertilizer mainly in cotton-producing areas, and 390 million catties have been prepared. In Shanxi Province, in addition to preparing 135 million catties of commercial fertilizer and a large number of pesticides to supply to farmers, agricultural farms and county farms in various special areas will also be equipped with a part of sprayers to provide to farmers in the form of lease. Henan Province has prepared 431.1 million catties of commercial fertilizer, 6.792 million catties of pesticides, and 30,000 sprayers. In Jiangsu Province, in addition to each county preparing a part of cotton seeds, the province also prepared 8.4 million catties of cotton seeds with a germination rate of over 70%; the province plans to control cotton insects in an area of 3.5 million mu, and the required pesticides and machinery have been fully prepared.
    At present, the soil moisture in the cotton fields of various cotton-producing areas is generally good. Party and government leading organs at all levels are continuing to publicize and mobilize farmers, help agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups formulate plans to expand the cotton field area in accordance with the requirements of the state, drive the broad masses of farmers to plant cotton, and carry out fertilizer accumulation, drought prevention, and flood prevention to welcome sowing, in order to victoriously complete and overfulfill the state's cotton planting plan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, April 6th] The state-owned Huangfanqu Mechanical Farm is actively carrying out various preparations for increasing cotton production, and is promoting the high-quality variety of Da Si cotton to farmers to help them increase cotton production. The farm's land preparation, seed selection, and seed dressing are underway. In order to help farmers sow cotton in a timely manner, the farm has specially selected more than 100,000 catties of high-quality, pure, and high-germination Da Si cotton varieties to supply to farmers in the surrounding counties. At present, agricultural technology guidance stations in Linying, Yancheng, and other places are transferring cotton seeds from the farm.

    坚决完成扩大棉田增产棉花任务
    中央农业部及时检查各区植棉准备工作
    【新华社六日讯】　中央人民政府农业部为帮助和推动各产棉区解决目前工作中的问题，在三月十七日到二十日召开了植棉准备工作汇报会议。到会的有华北、华东、中南、西北、东北等区和河北、山西、山东、江苏、河南、湖北、陕西等省农业部门代表十多人。
    会议开始，中央人民政府农业部部长李书城阐述了完成今年植棉任务的重要性。接着各地代表汇报植棉准备情况，并对植棉中存在的问题展开讨论。副部长杨显东就如何改进植棉技术作了报告。
    根据各地代表的汇报和讨论，会议结论指出：只要大家再努一把力，今年国家的植棉计划是有条件完成的。为了适应国家纺织工业的发展和满足民用絮棉的需要，各地应坚决完成今年扩大棉田和增产棉花的任务。增产粮食是当前农业生产战线上的首要任务，但对粮、棉增产必须作全面的安排。各地一般强调宣传增产粮食支援国家建设是对的，但在宜棉地区，必须强调宣传增产棉花也是对国家工业化的贡献。
    会议结论指出：各产棉区必须大力宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线，帮助农民认清社会主义工业化的好处；宣传棉粮比价政策，进行算细账，把农民的个人利益和国家利益结合起来；宣传粮食计划收购计划供应的政策，教育农民不要顾虑买不到粮食；以及宣传棉花预购政策和棉花可以抵交公粮的政策等，引导农民自觉自愿地按照国家计划种植棉花。
    杨显东在报告中说：不仅要保证完成扩大棉田的任务，同时要保证完成提高单位面积产量的任务。因此，各地必须大力开展技术传授工作，按照不同地区的不同情况，做到保种保苗、增施肥料、防治病虫和提高栽培技术。
    【新华社六日讯】　全国各产棉区农民正在按照国家计划进行植棉准备，以支援国家纺织工业和满足人民需要。根据华北、华东、中南、西北、东北等区的情况来看，各产棉区只要再努一把力，都可能按计划完成植棉任务。江苏省由于去年棉花丰收，农民植棉情绪很高，盐垦区农民积极开垦荒地植棉，全省植棉计划可以超额完成。
    今年各产棉区经过国家在过渡时期的总路线和工农联盟的宣传，农民生产情绪都很高涨。但也有部分农民对扩大植棉面积存在一些顾虑。比如山东省聊城专区有些农民，曾怕多种棉花后买不到粮食，牲口没草吃；有的还怕发生虫害和水灾，棉花收成没有保证，以及棉花不如花生、地瓜（甘薯）收益大等。聊城专区各级党政领导机关针对这种情况，便在各种会议上继续深入宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和工农联盟，宣传今年提高粮棉比价等政策，进行具体算细账；同时注意推广植棉技术，领导农民普遍耙春地，防旱保墒，并大量积粗肥和选换棉种。这样，全专区农民就自觉自愿地修订了增植棉花的计划，预计可比原来植棉二百三十五万亩的计划超过二万亩。河北省满城县先在县、区、乡三级干部会议中、农业生产合作社代表大会中和互助组长训练班里讨论了如何完成扩大棉田的任务，随后县、区两级又抽调干部二百三十九人组成工作组下乡，向农民广泛宣传国家过渡时期的总路线和有关植棉的各项政策，并用各种事实解除农民的顾虑，加以粮食部门在农村中适当增设了售粮点，简化了购粮手续，全县农民就纷纷修订植棉计划。现在，全县二百六十四个农业生产合作社中，已有一百九十五个社把计划修订好，合计起来将按照国家的计划比去年扩大植棉面积百分之三十三。陕西省武功、泾阳、长安、澄城、大荔、褒城等县在展开宣传动员后，许多农民就把准备种大瓜、蔬菜、红苕的地改种棉花，以达到计划保持原有植棉面积的要求。
    各产棉区都及早准备了大量棉种、肥料和药械供应农民。河北省已准备棉种四千万斤；全省计划以产棉区为主供应商品肥料近十亿斤，现已准备好三亿九千万斤。山西省除已准备一亿三千五百万斤商品肥料和大批药械供应农民外，同时各专区农场和县农场将配备一部分喷雾器，以租借方式供给农民使用。河南省已准备商品肥料四亿三千一百万斤，农药六百七十九万二千斤，喷雾器三万架。江苏省除各县准备一部分棉种外，还由省准备了八百四十万斤棉种，发芽率在百分之七十以上；全省计划防治棉虫面积三百五十万亩，所需药械已有充分准备。
    目前，各产棉区的棉田墒情一般良好。各级党政领导机关正继续向农民进行宣传动员，帮助农业生产合作社、互助组按照国家的要求订出扩大棉田面积的计划，带动广大农民植棉，并开展积肥、防旱、防涝，迎接播种，以胜利完成和超额完成国家的植棉计划。
    【新华社开封六日电】　国营黄泛区机械农场积极进行增产棉花的各种准备工作，并向农民推广大斯棉优良品种，帮助农民增产棉花。农场的整地、选种、拌种等工作正在紧张进行。为了帮助农民及时播种棉花，农场特选出了十多万斤质量纯洁、发芽率高的大斯棉优良品种，供应周围各县的农民。现临颍、郾城等地各农业技术指导站正从该场调运棉种。
