    A Liberated Cambodian Village

    Great changes have taken place in the liberated Cambodian villages, and the people are living a free and happy life.

    Zuo Keng Village in Kampot Province in southwestern Cambodia was originally a remote village where people lived in extreme suffering under French colonial rule. Due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of the French colonialists, the peasants in this rice-producing village had to eat potatoes and corn for eight or nine months of the year. Large tracts of land were left uncultivated because the farmers did not have enough farm implements or money to obtain licenses to cultivate.

    However, since the Cambodian People's Liberation Army entered Zuo Keng in the spring of 1948, the village has gradually changed. Farmers can reclaim wasteland, fish, hunt, or gather firewood without oppression, and their lives have greatly improved. Bandits have disappeared, and people can even leave their doors unlocked at night. In the past, only four out of 360 people in the village were literate, but now the number of people who can read and write has increased to 200.

    Fifty-five-year-old poor peasant Jin Zhai only had a small piece of land during the French colonial occupation. Although he worked diligently all year round, his income was only barely enough to make a living. But now he is able to harvest enough rice and other non-staple foods for the whole year. His wife, young daughter, and himself each have a set of formal attire that they can wear to religious ceremonies held in the pagoda. He used to live in a small thatched cottage, but now he lives in a large wooden house.

    When Jin Zhai is resting, he can sit under the palm trees in his garden and drink the refreshing coconut juice. He often tells his children that it is the Cambodian People's Liberation Army that has given us this good life. We must remember the benefits that the Resistance Government, the Liberation Army, and Chairman Son Ngoc Minh have given us. We should put all our strength into resisting foreign aggressors and defending our homeland.

    After the liberation of Zuo Keng Village, a guerrilla unit was established. Jin Zhai actively participated in sentry duty to guard against sudden enemy attacks. Both of his sons joined the Cambodian People's Liberation Army and the guerrillas.

    Because of the people's strict guard, in the six years after liberation, the French aggressors only re-entered the village once, but were immediately driven away by the guerrillas, and thirty-five enemy soldiers were killed or wounded.

    Today, in Cambodia, thousands of villages like Zuo Keng form the liberated areas and guerrilla bases of Cambodia.

### 一个解放了的高棉乡村

    一个解放了的高棉乡村
    解放了的高棉乡村起了很大的变化，人民过着自由和幸福的生活。
    高棉西南唝吥省的左铿村原是一个偏僻的村庄，在法国殖民者的统治下，人民处境痛苦到了极点。由于法国殖民者的残酷剥削和压迫，这个出产大米的村庄，农民一年中有八九个月要吃马铃薯和玉米。大片的田地荒芜，因为农民没有足够的农具也没有钱去领取执照来耕种。
    但是，从一九四八年春天高棉人民解放军进入左铿开始，这个村庄就渐渐变了样。农民可以不受压迫地开垦荒地、捕鱼、打猎或打柴，生活得到很大改善。盗匪已经绝迹，人们甚至可以夜不闭户了。过去全村三百六十个人中间只有四个认识字，现在能读会写的人增加到两百个。
    五十五岁的贫农谨斋，在法国殖民者占领期间，只有一小块土地。虽然终年辛勤耕作，收入仅能勉强糊口。但现在他已能收获足够的大米和其他副食品供全年吃用。他的妻子、小女儿和他自己每人都有了一套礼服，可以穿去参加佛塔里面举行的宗教仪式。以前他住在一间小茅屋里面，现在他住的是一座大木头房子。
    谨斋休息时还能坐在花园里的棕榈树下，喝那令人心旷神怡的椰子汁。他常对孩子们说，使我们有这种好日子过的是高棉人民解放军。我们必须记住抗战政府、解放军与山玉明主席给我们的好处。我们应该拿出全部力量来反抗外国侵略者和保卫家乡。
    左铿村解放以后就建立了游击队。谨斋积极参加放哨，防备敌人突然的攻击。他的两个儿子都参加了高棉人民解放军和游击队。
    因为人民的严密守卫，解放后的六年中，法国侵略者只有一次重新进入这个村庄，但随即被游击队赶跑了，三十五名敌军被杀伤。
    如今在高棉，几千个像左铿这样的村庄组成了高棉的解放区和游击根据地。
