Hangzhou tea farmers in the Longjing tea area have begun picking spring tea. The earliest picking was at the state-owned Longjing Tea Farm, which picked "one bud and one leaf" "Bao Xin" tea on Qingming Festival, the highest grade of Longjing tea, called "Lion Peak Supreme." The quality of tea this year is better than last year, and the output will also increase. The tea bushes are vibrant, with neat and strong budding. The price of Longjing tea produced by the farm this year is lower than last year: "Lion Peak Supreme" is reduced by 20%, "Ming Qian" is reduced by 17%, and "Yu Qian" is reduced by 7.5%. Around Guyu, it is the peak season for "Guyu tea, a handful to grab." Thousands of tea farmers in the Longjing Tea Farm and tea area will be engaged in more intensive labor.

    杭州茶农开始采摘龙井茶
    杭州龙井茶区的茶农们，已在采摘春茶。采摘最早的是地方国营龙井茶场，清明节那天即采制“一芽一叶”的“报新”茶，这是龙井茶叶品级最高的一种，称为“狮峰极品”。全场今年茶叶品质比去年好，产量也将比去年增加，茶丛生机勃勃，发芽齐整壮旺。该场今年所出龙井茶叶售价，较去年减低：“狮峰极品”减低百分之二十，“明前”减低百分之十七，“雨前”减低百分之七点五。谷雨前后，正是“谷雨茶、满把抓”的茶汛旺期，龙井茶场及茶区数以千计的茶农，将投入更紧张的劳动中。
