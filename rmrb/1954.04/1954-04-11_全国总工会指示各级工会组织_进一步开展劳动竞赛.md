The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Instructs Trade Union Organizations at All Levels to Further Carry Out Labor Emulation Drives

[By this newspaper] The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions passed on January 27th the "Instruction on Further Carrying Out Labor Emulation Drives in State-Owned Factories and Mining Enterprises" to trade union organizations at all levels. The full text of the instruction is as follows:

I. The Chinese working class, as the leading class of the state, must adopt the most effective methods to continuously increase labor productivity. Because only by continuously increasing labor productivity can we guarantee the smooth completion of the national construction plan, the victory of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, the gradual improvement of the material and cultural life of the working class and the working people, and the effective defense of the security of the motherland and world peace. In order to rapidly increase labor productivity, the entire working class must treat the country's construction undertakings with a communist attitude towards labor.

Labor emulation is a concrete manifestation of the communist attitude towards labor, and it is itself the best kind of communist education. Labor emulation can fundamentally change people's views on labor, make people realize that labor in the new society is a glorious, noble, and courageous cause, enable people to correctly treat labor, correctly treat public property, and overcome the non-working class thoughts—small producer and bourgeois thoughts—in the ranks of the working class. Labor emulation is also a mass-based, realistic criticism and self-criticism. With its help, we can break old conventions, overcome all obstacles that hinder the masses from advancing, and gradually tap the potential strength hidden within the working class. Labor emulation is an inexhaustible source of the creative ability of the working class.

Labor emulation and capitalist competition are essentially different. Competition is detrimental to others and benefits oneself. It is a method of seizing and consolidating victory by attacking others, while labor emulation uses advanced elements to drive the backward and provides comrades with assistance to achieve common improvement. Through labor emulation, the backward are gradually raised to the level of the advanced, the backward links in production are continuously eliminated, and labor productivity is continuously improved. Therefore, timely discovery and support of all advanced innovative initiatives, and summarizing and promoting the experience of advanced producers, have become one of the most important conditions for organizing labor emulation.

Labor emulation is a reliable guarantee for developing production and realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and it is a basic method of socialist construction. As Comrade Stalin taught: "In reality, emulation is a method of building socialism and communism based on the greatest enthusiasm of millions of working people. In reality, emulation is such a lever, with the help of which the working class will turn the entire economic and cultural life of the country upside down on a socialist basis." Therefore, attracting and organizing the broad masses of workers to participate in labor emulation, giving full play to the initiative and pioneering spirit of the working class, thereby continuously increasing labor productivity, to ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the national plan, is the primary task of trade union organizations.

II. The Chinese working class, taking the Soviet Union as an example, carried out various forms of labor emulation in many liberated areas as early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War and the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the early days of liberation, the broad masses of workers, with the attitude of masters of the country, actively participated in the struggles of protecting factories, taking over, inventorying materials, donating equipment, and restoring production. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and in various campaigns to increase production and practice economy, they further developed their labor enthusiasm to a high degree, launched an unprecedentedly magnificent mass-based labor emulation drive, and made great contributions to the country's construction cause.

Practice has proven that labor emulation is an inevitable manifestation of the conscious labor enthusiasm of the working class after it becomes the leading class of the country, and it is an inevitable manifestation of the new relations of production. However, in the early days of liberation, we lacked experience in leading labor emulation, so the early labor emulation had a certain degree of spontaneity. This spontaneous labor emulation inevitably overemphasized strengthening labor intensity. It was characterized by great impetuosity and blindness, while organization and planning were lacking. Therefore, it showed great shortcomings in product quality, product cost, labor protection, and technical safety. This kind of impetuous competition cannot last. However, it must be admitted that the labor enthusiasm of the masses is extremely valuable, and appropriately strengthening labor intensity is also necessary. Therefore, we must never negate labor emulation because the early labor emulation had these shortcomings, but should cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, actively strengthen the leadership of spontaneous labor emulation, and make it a regular form of labor for the working masses. Now that the democratic reform of enterprises has been completed, and the various industrial departments have begun to implement planned management, the production responsibility system, and economic accounting system, the improvement of labor emulation is even more objectively possible. In fact, many factories and mines have accumulated some experience in leading labor emulation and have emerged with advanced units such as the May 3rd Factory, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the China Changchun Railway. Especially since the central government called for carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and carried out education on the general line of the state's transition period among the working masses, labor emulation has undergone new and tremendous development. Trade union organizations have every necessity and possibility to adapt to the progress of production management and push labor emulation further forward.

III. The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has made principled provisions on how to organize labor emulation. The Third Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also determined the direction for pushing labor emulation forward and proposed that the main tasks of current labor emulation are: to require each enterprise, workshop, and group to comprehensively and balancedly complete and strive to over-fulfill the various indicators of the national plan, to continuously improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce product costs, improve operating conditions, and ensure production safety through labor emulation, and to continuously improve the technical level of the working masses and the management level of enterprises through labor emulation. In order to achieve these requirements, we must pay close attention to the innovation of production technology and the improvement of labor organization, rather than focusing on physical strength. Such labor emulation must be organized and planned, not spontaneous. Such labor emulation can become a continuous and regular labor method, not a rush.

In order to push labor emulation further forward, this requires trade union organizations to improve their leadership level in labor emulation, carry out in-depth, meticulous, and specific organizational work, overcome formalism and bureaucracy; grasp ideological work firmly, overcome championship-ism in competition, oppose the bad criminal behavior of fabricating achievements to obtain honors, and fight against the capitalist competitive thinking. With the development of competition, on the basis of improving labor productivity, gradually and actively improve the labor conditions, housing, medical care, and other cultural and living facilities of employees in accordance with the principle of need and possibility.

IV. Labor emulation is a basic method for building our motherland, so organizing labor emulation is not only the task of trade union organizations, but also the task of enterprise administration, and it is the cause of the entire Party. The reason why enterprise administration must undertake the task of organizing competition is because only by relying on the determination and will of the broad masses of employees to complete the national plan and giving full play to the initiative of the employees can we better exert the potential strength of the enterprise and continuously improve the enterprise management level. Conversely, the more scientific and reasonable the organization and planning of the enterprise, the more it can give play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses. In labor emulation, enterprise administration is responsible for announcing the production plan on time, formulating and implementing organizational and technical measures aimed at ensuring the continuous progress of labor emulation, and giving full play to the role of functional departments, so that production can be carried out in a balanced and rhythmic manner. Enterprise administration regularly publishes production results and plans to promote the piece-rate wage system, which are necessary conditions for widely carrying out labor emulation. Therefore, under the unified leadership of the Party, trade union organizations should organize labor emulation realistically in conjunction with the administrative departments, continuously educate the masses with the spirit of communism, give play to the initiative and creativity of the working masses, and strive for the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of the national plan, for higher labor productivity, and for accelerating the process of the country's socialist industrialization!

V. In order to push labor emulation further forward, it is necessary to further clarify the following issues:

First, the form of competition. The forms of labor emulation are diverse, and various forms of competition can be adopted according to specific circumstances. Such as competition between individuals, groups, or workshops, competition throughout the industry (i.e., between factories), competition between the same types of work and business; and of course, there are other forms of competition that reflect a certain requirement of current production, such as the railway "Full Load Over Axis Five Hundred Kilometer Movement," as well as competitions to improve quality and reduce costs, etc. But mobile red flags cannot be regarded as a form of competition.

Second, the conditions for competition. Organizing competition must have clear conditions for competition. These conditions for competition are the guarantee conditions put forward for completing the administrative plan. Guarantee conditions are put forward realistically based on the various indicators of the production plan of factories and mines. These competition conditions generally include: completing the average advanced product quota, achieving excellent product quality, saving raw materials, materials, and tools to reduce costs, and learning and mastering advanced operating methods. Guarantee conditions should not be uniform, nor should abstract slogans be included in the indicators. The competition conditions should not be too numerous. The forms of patriotic conventions, production increase and economy plans, etc., currently adopted by many factories and mines can actually be unified by one form of guarantee conditions.

Third, the evaluation of competition. The results of the competition should be announced regularly, the advanced should be commended, and the shortcomings should be criticized. The winner should be determined according to the degree of completion of the guarantee conditions, but other factors besides the guarantee conditions, such as the complexity of the task, the degree of technical proficiency, and the condition of the equipment, must also be considered and compared. Because the purpose of the evaluation is to summarize and disseminate advanced experience, find the reasons why backward links are backward, and take specific measures to eliminate backward phenomena and gradually raise the backward to the level of the advanced. The scoring system adopted by many factories and mines at present must be gradually changed. This method restricts the initiative and creativity of the masses and may lead the competition to competition.

The evaluation materials rely on the supply of enterprise administration. Trade union organizations should assist the administration in establishing a system of original records and a statistical system for competition, setting up a bulletin board for competition results, and publishing irregular news reports and bulletins.

Fourth, the reward for competition. In addition to giving material rewards to the winners in the labor emulation, honorary rewards should also be given. The mobile red flag is a very good form of reward, which has a great inspirational effect on the workers' labor enthusiasm. However, at present, various places use the red flag as a form of competition or motivation, so that too many red flags are issued, and the methods are too complicated, thus reducing its effect. This situation must be rectified. Each factory and mine can generally set up one or two mobile red flags and issue them to the winning workshops, sections, or groups; workshops can also set up one or two small pennants and issue them to advanced workers. A certain amount of bonus can be attached to the units and individuals who win the winning red flag, and this bonus can be paid from the factory reward fund. In addition, according to the specific circumstances, establish a honorary reward system for glory lists, glory books, and honorary titles such as advanced workers and labor models. For this system, the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions entrusted the Secretariat to study it and assist relevant departments in formulating plans.

Fifth, the issue of mobilizing engineering and technical personnel and staff to participate in the competition. Mobilizing and organizing engineering and technical personnel and staff to participate in the competition can also put forward guarantee conditions according to specific circumstances. In addition to ensuring that the tasks are over-fulfilled, the guarantee conditions for engineering and technical personnel and staff should also include: reducing the labor consumption of products, saving on the expenditure of wage funds, correctly specifying the load of machinery and equipment, reasonably formulating the maintenance plan of machinery and equipment, and making every effort to reduce the overhead expenses of the entire factory and each workshop. However, the competition methods of direct production workers cannot be rigidly applied to engineering and technical personnel and staff. Because the work of engineering and technical personnel and staff does not have specific quotas like workers, and it is unnecessary to stipulate the rules that they must abide by within the scope of their duties in the guarantee conditions, so some engineering and technical personnel and staff do not necessarily have to make guarantee conditions. Their responsibility is to plan and organize production most effectively and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of national plan indicators. As long as they have carried out creative labor in addition to completing the work within the scope of their duties, such as assisting workers in putting forward rationalization proposals or promoting advanced experience, actively participating in certain production meetings, and improving the production of the entire factory or mine, workshop, and section, the winners can also be realistically evaluated according to these specific circumstances.

    全国总工会指示各级工会组织
    进一步开展劳动竞赛
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第二次会议于一月二十七日通过向各级工会组织发出“关于在国营厂矿企业中进一步开展劳动竞赛的指示”，指示全文如下：
    一、作为国家领导阶级的中国工人阶级，必须采取最有效的办法来不断地提高劳动生产率。因为只有不断地提高劳动生产率，才能保证国家建设计划的顺利完成，才能保证我国社会主义建设事业和社会主义改造的胜利，才能逐步提高工人阶级和劳动人民的物质和文化生活，才能有效地捍卫祖国的安全与世界的和平。为了迅速地提高劳动生产率，全国工人阶级必须以共产主义的劳动态度来对待国家的建设事业。
    劳动竞赛是共产主义劳动态度的一种具体表现，同时它本身就是一种最好的共产主义教育。劳动竞赛可以根本改变人们对劳动的看法，使人们认识到新社会的劳动是光荣、高尚、勇敢的事业，使人们正确地对待劳动，正确地对待公共财物，克服工人阶级队伍中非工人阶级的思想——小生产者以及资产阶级的思想。劳动竞赛也是一种群众性的实事求是的批评与自我批评，借助于它可以打破因循守旧的观念，突破一切束缚群众前进的障碍，把蕴藏在工人阶级内部的潜在力量逐步发掘出来。劳动竞赛是工人阶级创造能力的不竭的源泉。
    劳动竞赛和资本主义的竞争有着本质的区别。竞争是损人利己的，是以打击别人的方法来夺取和巩固胜利的，而劳动竞赛则是以先进带动落后，并给落后者以同志的帮助，来达到共同提高的目的。通过劳动竞赛，逐步地把落后者提高到先进者的水平，不断地消除生产中的落后环节，不断地提高劳动生产率。所以，及时地发现与支持一切先进的革新的创举，总结与推广先进生产者的经验，就成为组织劳动竞赛的极重要的条件之一。
    劳动竞赛是发展生产、实现国家的社会主义工业化的可靠保证，是社会主义建设的基本方法。正如斯大林同志所教导的：“实际上竞赛是千百万劳动群众在最大积极性的基础上建设社会主义的共产主义方法。实际上竞赛是这样的杠杆，借助于它，工人阶级要在社会主义基础上把国内整个经济生活和文化生活翻转过来。”所以，吸引与组织广大工人群众参加劳动竞赛，发挥工人阶级的主动性和首创精神，从而不断地提高劳动生产率，以保证国家计划的完成并争取超额完成，是工会组织的首要任务。
    二、中国工人阶级以苏联为榜样，远在第二次国内革命战争和抗日战争时期在许多解放区就开展过各种形式的劳动竞赛。解放初期，广大工人群众以主人翁的态度，积极地参加了护厂、接管、清点物资、献纳器材、恢复生产等斗争；在抗美援朝和历次增产节约运动中，更高度地发挥了劳动热情，展开了空前壮阔的群众性的劳动竞赛，对祖国的建设事业有了巨大的贡献。
    实践证明：劳动竞赛是工人阶级成为国家的领导阶级之后的自觉的劳动热情的必然的表现，是新的生产关系的必然的表现。可是解放初期，我们对劳动竞赛的领导还缺乏经验，所以初期的劳动竞赛，带有一定的自发性。这种带有自发性的劳动竞赛，不可避免地是过份偏重于加强劳动强度的，它的突击性、盲目性很大，而组织性、计划性却很缺乏，所以在产品质量、产品成本、劳动保护和技术安全方面都表现出很大的缺点。这种突击性的竞赛绝不能持久。可是必须承认群众的这种劳动热情是极为可贵的，适当地加强劳动强度也是需要的。所以绝不能因为初期的劳动竞赛带有这些缺点而否定劳动竞赛，而是应该珍贵群众的热情，对带有自发性的劳动竞赛积极地加强领导，使之成为工人群众的经常的劳动方式。现在，企业的民主改革已经完成，各工业部门又都开始实行了计划管理、生产责任制和经济核算制，因而使劳动竞赛的提高更加具备了客观的条件。事实上许多厂矿已经积累了一些领导劳动竞赛的经验，并且出现了像五三工厂、鞍山钢铁公司、中长路等先进的单位。特别是自中央号召开展增产节约运动和在工人群众中进行了关于国家过渡时期总路线的教育以后，劳动竞赛有了新的巨大的发展。工会组织完全有必要和可能与生产管理工作的进步相适应，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。
    三、中国工会第七次全国代表大会对于如何组织劳动竞赛已作了原则的规定。中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第三次会议又确定了把劳动竞赛向前推进一步的方向，并提出目前劳动竞赛的主要任务就是：要求每个企业、车间和小组，全面地、均衡地完成和争取超额完成国家计划的各项指标，通过劳动竞赛不断地提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，改善操作条件，保证生产安全，通过劳动竞赛不断地提高工人群众的技术水平和企业的管理水平。为了达到这些要求，就必须十分注意生产技术的革新与劳动组织的改进，而不应该是偏重于拚体力的。这样的劳动竞赛，必须是有组织有计划的，而不能是自流的。这样的劳动竞赛才能成为持续的经常的劳动方式，而不是突击。
    为了把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，这就要求工会组织提高对劳动竞赛的领导水平，进行深入细致的具体的组织工作，克服形式主义和官僚主义；抓紧思想工作，克服竞赛中的锦标主义，反对捏造成绩骗取荣誉的恶劣的犯罪行为，向资本主义的竞争思想进行斗争。随着竞赛的发展，在提高劳动生产率的基础上，根据需要与可能的原则，逐步地积极地改善职工的劳动条件、住宅、医疗及其他文化生活设施。
    四、劳动竞赛是建设我们祖国的基本方法，所以组织劳动竞赛不仅是工会组织的任务，也是企业行政方面的任务，是全党的事业。企业行政之所以必须担负起组织竞赛的任务，是因为只有依靠广大职工群众完成国家计划的决心和意志，高度发挥职工群众的主动性，才能更好地发挥企业的潜在力量，才能不断地提高企业管理水平。反过来说，企业的组织与计划愈科学、愈合理就愈能更高地发挥群众的劳动热情。在劳动竞赛中企业行政有责任按时宣布生产计划，制订与实施旨在保证劳动竞赛不断前进的组织技术措施计划，充分发挥职能部门的作用，从而使生产均衡地有节奏地进行；企业行政定期公布生产成绩，有计划地推广计件工资制，都是广泛开展劳动竞赛的必要条件。因此，工会组织要在党的统一领导下，会同行政部门实事求是地组织劳动竞赛，不断地以共产主义精神教育群众，发挥工人群众的主动性和创造性，为全面地完成与争取超额完成国家计划，为更高的劳动生产率，为加速实现国家的社会主义工业化的进程而斗争！
    五、为了把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，需要进一步明确以下几个问题：
    第一、竞赛的形式。劳动竞赛的形式是多种多样的，可以根据具体情况采取各种不同的竞赛形式。如个人、小组或车间之间的竞赛，整个产业（即工厂与工厂之间）的竞赛，同工种、同业务之间的竞赛；当然还有其它反映当前生产的某种要求的竞赛的形式，如铁路“满载超轴五百公里运动”，以及提高质量、降低成本的竞赛等等。但不能把流动红旗当作竞赛的形式。
    第二、竞赛的条件。组织竞赛要有明确的竞赛条件，这种竞赛条件就是对于完成行政的计划而提出的保证条件。保证条件是根据厂矿企业的生产计划的各项指标，实事求是地提出来的。这种竞赛条件一般应包括：完成平均先进产品定额，达到优等产品质量，节约原料、材料和工具以降低成本，学习与掌握先进操作方法等项目。保证条件不应该是千篇一律的，也不应该把抽象的口号列入指标。竞赛条件不应过分繁多，目前许多厂矿所采用的爱国公约、增产节约计划等形式，实际上都可用竞赛的保证条件一种形式统一起来。
    第三、竞赛的评比。要定期公布竞赛成绩，表扬先进，批评缺点。要根据完成保证条件的程度确定优胜者，但也必须考虑到保证条件以外的其他因素，如任务繁简、技术熟练程度、设备状况等，加以比较。因为评比的目的在于总结和传播先进经验，寻找落后环节之所以落后的原因，并采取具体措施消除落后现象，把落后者逐步提高到先进者的水平。目前许多厂矿所采取的分数制的办法必须注意逐步加以改变，这种办法限制着群众的主动性和创造性，并可能把竞赛导向竞争。
    评比的材料是依靠企业行政供给的。工会组织要协助行政建立好原始记录的制度和竞赛的统计制度，设置竞赛成绩的公布牌，并刊行不定期的捷报、喜报。
    第四、竞赛的奖励。对劳动竞赛中的优胜者，除发给物质奖励外，还应给予荣誉奖励。流动红旗是一种很好的奖励形式，这种奖励对工人的劳动热情有极大的鼓舞作用。但目前各地把红旗当作竞赛或鼓动的形式，使红旗发得太多，办法也太复杂，因而减低了它的作用。这种情形必须加以整顿。每一个厂、矿一般可以设置一两面流动红旗，发给优胜的车间、工段或小组；车间也可设置一两面小锦旗，发给先进工人。对获得优胜红旗的单位和个人，可附发一定数额的奖金，此项奖金可由工厂奖励基金中支付。此外，可根据具体情况，建立光荣榜、光荣册和先进工作者、劳动模范等光荣称号的荣誉奖励制度。对于这种制度，中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会委托书记处加以研究，协助有关部门拟订方案。
    第五、发动工程技术人员和职员参加竞赛问题。动员与组织工程技术人员和职员参加竞赛，也可以根据具体情况提出保证条件，工程技术人员和职员的保证条件，除要保证超额完成任务外，还应该包括：降低产品的劳动消耗量，节省地开支工资基金，正确地规定机器设备的负荷，合理地制订机器设备的检修计划，尽力降低全厂和各车间的杂费开支。但不能把直接生产工人的竞赛办法，硬搬到工程技术人员和职员中去。因为工程技术人员和职员的工作，不像工人一样有具体的定额，在保证条件中规定他们职责范围内必须遵守的规则又是不必要的，所以某些工程技术人员和职员不一定都要订保证条件。他们的职责就是最有效地计划与组织生产，保证全面地均衡地完成国家计划指标。只要他们除了完成本身职责范围内的工作以外，还进行了创造性的劳动，例如协助工人提合理化建议或推广先进经验，积极参加一定的生产会议，把整个厂矿或车间、工段的生产搞好，也可以根据这些具体的情况，实事求是地评比优胜者。
