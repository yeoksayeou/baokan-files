Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 5th: Genghis Khan's coffin has been moved from Qinghai back to Inner Mongolia. On the morning of April 3rd, the special train carrying the coffin arrived in Gui Sui, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Wang Zaitian, Director of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Relocation and New Mausoleum Construction Committee, along with committee members Yang Zhilin, Sun Lanfeng, Li Shijie, Kong Fei, and representatives from various agencies, troops, and organizations, totaling more than 400 people, held a grand welcoming ceremony at the station. It is expected that within a week, the coffin will be safely moved back to the old site of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum in the Ikh Zhao League on the west bank of the Yellow River. The foundation laying ceremony for the new Genghis Khan Mausoleum will be held on April 23rd.

    Genghis Khan's coffin was originally located in Ejin Horo in the Ikh Zhao League. In 1939, the Kuomintang reactionaries, disregarding the opposition of the local Mongolian people, forcibly seized the mausoleum and moved it to Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province. In 1949, before the liberation of Northwest China, it was again forcibly transported to Ta'er Temple in Qinghai Province. It was not until December 1953 that the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, at the request of the Mongolian people of the Ikh Zhao League and with the approval of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, established the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Relocation and New Mausoleum Construction Committee and decided to move Genghis Khan's Mausoleum back to Ejin Horo. On March 15th of this year, a welcoming delegation composed of Kligeng (Mongolian), Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, Wu Daping (Han), Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, Ochir Hoya Gatu (Mongolian), Head of the Ikh Zhao League, and well-known Mongolian figures, went to Ta'er Temple to carry out the relocation. After the welcoming delegation arrived in Qinghai, Zhou Renshan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, Guan Baojia (Mongolian), Chairman of the People's Government of the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region of Qinghai Province, and Dan Ren (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee, accompanied them and held a grand mausoleum raising ceremony at Ta'er Temple, the site of Genghis Khan's Mausoleum, in accordance with Mongolian customs. On March 29th, the welcoming delegation escorted Genghis Khan's coffin, the coffin of Lady Hulan, and Genghis Khan's relic, the Sulude (spear), and other sacrificial vessels, back to Inner Mongolia by special train, receiving warm care from the responsible party and government organs along the way in Gansu and other places.

    成吉思汗灵柩由青海移回内蒙古
    【新华社归绥五日电】成吉思汗灵柩已由青海移回内蒙古。迁陵的专车在四月三日上午到达内蒙古自治区首府——归绥后，成吉思汗陵迁移及新陵园建筑委员会主任王再天和委员杨植霖、孙兰峰、李世杰、孔飞以及各机关、部队、团体的代表共四百多人，在车站举行了隆重的迎祭仪式。预计一周内灵柩将安全移回黄河西岸伊克昭盟的成吉思汗陵园旧址，新的成吉思汗陵园将在四月二十三日举行奠祭典礼。
    成吉思汗灵柩原在伊克昭盟伊金霍洛地方。国民党反动派在一九三九年不顾当地蒙族人民的反对，武装劫走成陵，移到甘肃省榆中县兴隆山，在一九四九年西北解放前夕又劫运到青海省塔尔寺。直到一九五三年十二月，内蒙古自治区人民政府应伊克昭盟蒙族人民的请求，并报请中央人民政府政务院批准，成立了成吉思汗陵迁移及新的陵园建筑委员会，决定将成吉思汗陵移回伊金霍洛。今年三月十五日由内蒙古自治区人民政府人民监察委员会主任克力更（蒙族）、内蒙古自治区人民政府文教委员会副主任武达平（汉族）、伊克昭盟盟长鄂齐尔呼雅克图（蒙族）以及蒙族知名人士组成迎陵代表团，前往塔尔寺进行移陵事宜。迎陵代表团到达青海后，由青海省人民政府民族事务委员会主任委员周仁山和青海省海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区人民政府主席官保加（蒙族）及协商委员会副主席丹仁（蒙族）等陪同，在成吉思汗陵所在地——塔尔寺按照蒙古民族的风俗习惯，举行了起陵大祭。三月二十九日，迎陵代表团护随成吉思汗灵柩、胡兰夫人灵柩和成吉思汗遗物苏鲁锭（长矛）及其他祭器，乘专车返回内蒙古，沿途受到甘肃等地党政负责机关的热情照顾。
