The highway from Leping to Dexing in Jiangxi Province has commenced trial operation.

The highway from Leping to Dexing in Jiangxi Province, located in the old revolutionary base area, was completely repaired on March 21st and has commenced trial operation.

During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to attack the revolutionary base areas, built a 55-kilometer-long highway there, which brought endless disasters to the people of the revolutionary base areas. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang relied on this highway to carry out bloody rule over the local people, and used the pretext of "road construction" to plunder and extort. Later, this highway gradually fell into disuse.

After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government, concerned about the development of the economic and cultural life of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, decided to repair this highway. After long-term preparations and the strong support of the people of Leping and Dexing counties, construction began in 1953 and was completed in February of this year.

On March 21st, the Leping County Bus Station held a trial run ceremony. When the bus arrived in Dexing, it was warmly welcomed by the local people. During the trial period, it is tentatively scheduled that buses will depart from Jingdezhen to Dexing via Leping every Monday, Thursday, and Sunday; and return from Dexing to Jingdezhen every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday. After the opening of the highway, Dexing County's local specialties such as timber, rosin, sugar, hogs, and sulfur can be continuously transported and sold to the outside world, and the industrial products needed by the local people will also be supplied in a timely manner.

In addition, the Yongxin-Anfu-Fenyi Highway in Jiangxi Province was completed in February of this year and is expected to have stations and be open to traffic in the second quarter. The completion of this highway will facilitate transportation between northwestern and central Jiangxi, and connect the transportation of local specialties from various parts of the Ji'an area with the railway, bringing greater happiness to the lives of the people in the old base areas.

    江西省乐平到德兴的公路已试行通车
    老革命根据地江西省乐平到德兴的公路，已在三月二十一日修复完竣，并试行通车。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期，蒋介石匪帮为了进攻革命根据地，在那里修筑了一条长五十五公里的公路，曾给革命根据地的人民带来了无尽的灾难。蒋介石匪帮倚靠这条公路，对当地人民进行了血腥的统治；借口“修路”进行掠夺和敲诈。后来这条公路便渐渐荒废。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府关心老革命根据地人民的经济和文化生活的发展，决定修复这条公路。经过长期的准备和乐平、德兴两县人民的大力支持，一九五三年开始动工整修，到今年二月已经竣工。
    三月二十一日，乐平县汽车站举行了试车通行典礼。当汽车抵达德兴时，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。目前在试行期间，暂定每逢一、四、七日由景德镇开车经乐平到德兴；二、五、八日由德兴开回景德镇。通车以后，德兴县的木材、松香、砂糖、毛猪、硫磺等土特产，可源源向外运销，当地人民所需要的工业产品也将会得到及时的供应。
    又：江西省永（新）安（福）分（宜）公路，已于今年二月间竣工，预计在第二季度内即可设站通车。这条公路的修成，将便利了赣西北与中部的交通，并使吉安专区各地的土特产品运输和铁路衔接起来，给老根据地人民生活带来更大的幸福。
