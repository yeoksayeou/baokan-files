As the mutual aid and cooperation movement develops daily, paddy field areas in East China, Central South, North China, and Northeast China are comprehensively rectifying existing pumping stations and focusing on developing a number of state-owned pumping stations.

According to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui provinces and the suburbs of Shanghai in East China alone, more than 50 pumping stations will be established this year, equipped with more than 300 pumps, totaling more than 6,600 horsepower. Jiangsu Province has decided that the government will invest 20 billion yuan in Yangzhou, Yancheng, Nantong, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Suzhou and other places, selecting areas that are prone to drought and waterlogging, have a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, and can significantly increase production, to set up more than 10 pumping stations, planning to benefit an area of 200,000 mu. The construction work in Zhejiang Province began before the New Year, and efforts are being made to complete it all before the spring plowing. The construction work in Fujian Province has also begun, and efforts will be made to complete it in May and June to irrigate the early rice for local farmers. The suburbs of Shanghai will establish 10 small pumping stations to solve the irrigation problem of 15,000 mu of vegetables. Liaoxi Province will lend 21 water pumps this year and add a pumping station in Panshan to carry out windmill pumping experiments. The planned area for drought-resistant irrigation will be increased from more than 18,000 hectares last year to more than 40,000 hectares.

Various places will also rectify the existing pumping stations to give them a greater role in agricultural production. The Mechanical Irrigation and Drainage General Station of the Guangdong Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has improved the 12-horsepower gas engine made in China, and the pumping efficiency has doubled. Hubei Province, based on local natural conditions, has determined a method of setting up fixed stations for centralized use, overcoming the shortcomings of decentralized use and blind operation in the past. This year, on the existing basis, 290 pumping machines (more than 3,500 horsepower) will ensure that 120,000 mu of farmland will benefit. The mechanical irrigation and drainage meeting held in Henan Province in February determined to rectify the six pumping stations in Junxian, Changge, Weichuan, Yancheng, Huangchuan and other counties.

In recent years, pumping stations in rural areas of our country have developed greatly. Since liberation, various places have added 1,300 agricultural pumping machines with more than 36,000 horsepower; more than 2,000 agricultural pumping machines have been repaired, with more than 37,000 horsepower. At present, the total number of agricultural pumping machines in the country is about 6,600, with a power of more than 137,000 horsepower. These pumping machines have removed the threat of drought and flood disasters for nearly 5 million mu of farmland, ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture.

In the rice field areas of Northeast China and the Bohai Bay area of ​​North China, some electric pumping stations have been expanded and newly built, which not only expanded the irrigated area, but also enabled large areas of saline-alkali wasteland that had never been cultivated in the past to obtain bumper harvests. At present, there are more than 40 electric pumping stations in the Bohai Bay area alone, and the area of ​​rice fields irrigated by electric water lifting has reached more than 300,000 mu. Last year, the average yield of rice per mu was nearly 700 jin. With the help of the people's governments, East China and Central South have improved and reorganized various scattered small pumping stations in recent years, and have added many pumping machines to put into production. In the southern Jiangsu area, which has more than 16 million mu of rice fields, about one-fifth of the area relies on pumping machines to solve irrigation and drainage problems. There are more than 3,000 privately-owned water-lifting boats (about 60,000 horsepower) that have been organized under the leadership and support of the people's government to implement regional joint contracting of fields, eliminating the feudal monopoly system and overcoming the chaotic phenomena such as scrambling for contracts, indiscriminate contracting, and cross-contracting of fields. Small electric pumping stations are particularly developed in southern Jiangsu. There are more than 160 small electric pumping stations (more than 5,000 horsepower) built by the masses along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. In recent years, the people's government has also focused on building modern electric drainage and irrigation projects in Erling, Danyang, Yangjiawei, Wuxi, Yongguzhou, Zhenjiang, and Baguazhou, Nanjing. The Erling electric irrigation project has a total of eight pumping stations and 27 electric pumping machines that can replace the labor of 20,000 people. In the past, the local rice yield was generally only 200 to 300 jin per mu, and the yield was reduced in dry years. Last year, with electric irrigation, although it did not rain for more than 40 days in July and August, the rice yield still increased by 30% to 40% compared with previous years, averaging more than 450 jin per mu. In areas prone to waterlogging, pumping stations have also played a significant role. Since the Yi Tai Dyke in Wuhu, Anhui, was built in 1927, it has suffered from waterlogging for 17 years in a row, resulting in serious production reduction. After the establishment of a drainage station in 1951, it has had bumper harvests for three consecutive years, and last year alone, it increased grain production by 7 million jin. There are many enclosed fields in the Pearl River Delta. During the summer and autumn rainy seasons, the water level outside the dike rises, and the accumulated water inside the dike cannot be discharged, and agricultural production is seriously affected. Since there are pumping stations, the threat of internal waterlogging has been basically eliminated. In addition, in the suburbs of Lanzhou, Kunming, Lushun, Dalian, and Beijing, a number of pumping stations have also been developed relying on urban electricity.

While developing pumping stations, various places have also trained many farmer technicians, enabling them to learn how to use machines and simple maintenance techniques. Among the more than 100 farmers trained in Hunan, 56 can independently master the machines. The pumping station established in Jiaxing, Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province in 1950 has a total of 11 pumping machines (more than 160 horsepower), which have been handed over to the local masses for management last year.

The establishment of pumping stations has also played a significant role in promoting the transformation of the local small-scale peasant economy. The first collective farm in our country, the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, was built on the land irrigated by electric water lifting at the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm. With the help of pumping stations, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also developed rapidly in the Bohai Bay area. In Ninghe County alone, farmers in the area benefiting from electric pumping stations have organized 35 agricultural production cooperatives.

    华东、中南等水田地区
    正在建立和整顿抽水机站
      【本报讯】随着互助合作运动日益发展的需要，华东、中南、华北、东北等区的水田地区对旧有抽水机站全面加以整顿，并重点发展一批国营抽水机站。
    仅据华东区的江苏、浙江、福建、安徽四省和上海市郊的不完全统计，今年将建立五十多个抽水机站，配备了三百多台抽水机，共计六千六百多匹马力的动力。江苏省决定由政府投资二百亿元分别在扬州、盐城、南通、松江、镇江、苏州等地，选择易旱易涝、互助合作基础较好又能显著增产的地区，设置十多个抽水机站，计划受益面积达二十万亩。浙江省建站工作在年前就已开始，春耕前争取全部完成。福建省的建站工作也已开始，五、六月间争取完成，以便给当地农民灌溉早稻。上海市郊将建立十个小型抽水机站，解决一万五千亩菜蔬的灌溉问题。辽西省今年贷放抽水机二十一台，并在盘山增设抽水站一处，进行风车抽水试验工作。旱地灌溉面积计划从去年一万八千多垧的基础上，提高到四万多垧。
    各地还将对旧有抽水机站进行整顿，使其在农业生产中发挥更大作用。广东省水利局机械排灌总站将我国自制的十二匹马力煤气机加以改良后，抽水效率提高了一倍。湖北省根据当地自然条件，确定了固定设站、集中使用的办法，克服过去分散使用、盲目经营的缺点，今年要在现有基础上，使二百九十台抽水机（三千五百多匹马力）保证受益农田十二万亩。河南省二月间召开的机械排灌会议，确定对浚县、长葛、洧川、郾城、潢川等县的六个抽水机站进行整顿。
    近几年中，我国农村中的抽水机站有很大发展，各地在解放后添置的农用抽水机有一千三百台，三万六千多匹马力的动力；修复的农用抽水机有二千余台，三万七千多匹马力的动力。现在全国农用抽水机的总数约有六千六百余台，所用动力在十三万七千匹马力以上。这些抽水机使将近五百万亩农田解除旱涝灾害的威胁，保证了农业的丰收。
    在东北稻田区域和华北渤海地区，扩建和新建了一些电力抽水站，不仅扩大了灌溉面积，而且使有些过去从未开垦过的盐碱荒地也能获得大片丰收。现仅渤海地区即有电力抽水站四十多处，利用电力扬水灌溉的稻田已达三十多万亩，去年平均每亩收稻谷近七百斤。华东、中南各地在人民政府帮助下，几年来，除改善与整理了原有各种零散的小型抽水机站外，并添置了很多抽水机投入生产。江苏南部地区一千六百多万亩水稻田中，约有五分之一的面积依靠抽水机解决灌溉排水问题。当地有三千多只私营的戽水机船（约有六万匹马力）已在人民政府领导与扶持下，组织起来实行分区联合包田，消除了封建把持制度，克服了争包、滥包、交错包田等混乱现象。小型电力抽水站在苏南地区特别发达，沪宁铁路沿线群众自办的小型电力抽水站有一百六十多处（五千多匹马力），人民政府近年又在丹阳珥陵、无锡杨家圩、镇江永固洲、南京八卦洲等地重点兴建了现代化的电力排灌工程。珥陵电力灌溉工程共有八个抽水站，二十七部可以代替两万人劳动的电动抽水机，当地水稻产量过去一般每亩只收二、三百斤，旱年还要减产，去年用电力灌溉，虽然七、八月间有四十多天没下雨，水稻产量仍比往年增加三、四成，平均每亩收四百五十多斤。在内涝地区，抽水机也发挥了显著作用。安徽芜湖易太圩从一九二七年建圩以来，有十七年连遭涝灾，减产严重，一九五一年建立排水站以后，三年连获丰收，去年一年中即增产粮食七百万斤。珠江三角洲有很多围田，夏秋雨季围外江水上涨，围内积水无法排泄，农业生产受到严重损失，自有了抽水机站，内涝威胁才基本消除。此外，在兰州、昆明、旅大和北京等市郊，依靠城市电力也发展了一批抽水机站。
    各地在发展抽水机站同时，还培养了很多农民技工，使他们学会了使用机器和简单的保养技术。湖南训练的一百多名农民中有五十六人能单独掌握机器，浙江省一九五○年在嘉兴桐乡建立的抽水机站，共有十一台抽水机（一百六十多匹马力），已在去年交给当地群众自己管理。
    抽水机站的建立，对当地小农经济的改造也起了重大的推动作用。我国第一个集体农庄——松江省桦川县星火集体农庄就是在桦川水利农场电力扬水灌溉的土地上建立起来的。渤海地区的农民在抽水机站的帮助下，互助合作运动也开展得较快，仅宁河一县在电力抽水站受益区的农民就组织了三十五个农业生产合作社。
