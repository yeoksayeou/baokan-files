Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, March 3rd: The eastern pastoral areas of the Xilin Gol League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which have been afflicted by snow disasters, have received care and assistance from all sides. Since the beginning of spring, the climate in this area has suddenly turned cold, with continuous heavy snowfall. Pastures are covered with snow up to about one foot deep, and in some places, the snow is three feet deep. Livestock cannot graze, and they are generally losing weight and becoming weak. In some areas, livestock have already collapsed or died. The Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Autonomous Region People's Government, in response to this situation, issued urgent instructions and allocated a large amount of fodder and transportation tools. At the same time, a disaster area慰问团 (comforting delegation), led by Shi Ruilin, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and other responsible cadres, took 300 million yuan in relief funds to Xilin Gol League to express condolences.

Under the guidance of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, neighboring leagues have been promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and support, providing manpower and materials to support the disaster area. Party and government officials in Zhaowuda League led truck and horse-drawn cart convoys filled with supplies to Xilin Gol League at the end of March to assist in disaster relief and livestock protection. The league also decided to provide 300,000 jin of naked oats and a large amount of bean cake and oil to support Xilin Gol League. Chahar League, Xing'an League, and others have designated the best pastures adjacent to Xilin Gol League for disaster-stricken herders to migrate.

At present, the party and government organs of Xilin Gol League have made doing a good job in disaster relief and livestock protection the central task that overrides everything else. They have put forward the slogan "Rescuing one more head of livestock is to add one more point of strength to national construction," and mobilized herders to fight against wind and snow disasters. Local CCP committees and people's governments, as well as heads of mass organizations, have formed work groups to go deep into various Zuo (districts) and yurts, leading herders to fight against wind and snow disasters.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The Central People's Government has sent aircraft for consecutive days to airdrop food to support herders in the eastern pastoral areas of the Xilin Gol League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to fight disaster and protect livestock.

Since the beginning of spring, Xilin Gol League has experienced continuous heavy snowfall, and snow has covered the pastures, trapping a large number of livestock. The snow is very deep in the severely affected areas of the east, and vehicles and horses cannot pass through. Food from nearby areas cannot be delivered in time to support disaster relief. The Central People's Government is extremely concerned about this and dispatched fifteen aircraft from April 1st to 3rd, airdropping more than 14,000 kilograms of grain and fodder. Local herders were extremely moved by the support they received from these grains.

    中央人民政府派飞机空投粮食饲料支援
   【新华社归绥三日电】积雪成灾的内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟东部牧区，已得到来自各方的关怀和援助。入春以来，这个地区的气候突然寒冷，连降大雪，牧场覆盖深达一尺左右的积雪，有些地方雪有三尺深。牲畜不能放牧，普遍掉膘瘦弱，部分地区的牲畜已爬卧不起或死亡。中共中央内蒙古分局、自治区人民政府根据这一情况，发出了紧急指示，并调拨了大批的饲料和交通运输工具，同时，由自治区人民政府农牧部副部长石汝麟等负责干部组成灾区慰问团，携带三亿元救济款前往锡盟慰问。
    在中共中央内蒙古分局的指导下，邻近各盟发扬互助互济的精神，以人力物力支援灾区。昭乌达盟的党政负责干部已在三月底带领满载物资的卡车、马车，赶赴锡盟协助抗灾保畜工作，该盟并决定以三十万斤莜麦及大量豆饼、油类支援锡盟。察哈尔盟、兴安盟等已划出了与锡盟毗连的最好牧场，供灾区牧民移牧。
    目前，锡盟党政机关已把做好抗灾保畜工作，当作当前压倒一切的中心任务，提出了“多抢活一头牲畜，就是为国家建设多增加一分力量”的口号，发动牧民抗灾保畜。当地中共党委和人民政府以及群众团体的负责人，都已组成工作组，深入各佐
  （区）和蒙古包，领导牧民向风雪灾害作斗争。
   【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府连日派出飞机空投粮食，支援内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟东部牧民抗灾保畜。
    入春后，锡林郭勒盟连降大雪，积雪覆盖牧场，大批牲畜被困。东部重灾区积雪很深，车马不能通行，附近各地的粮食不能及时支援救灾。中央人民政府对此极为关怀，于四月一日到三日派出飞机十五架次，空投粮食饲料一万四千多公斤。当地牧民得到这些粮食的支援后，极为感动。
