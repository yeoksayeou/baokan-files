Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 26th: "Pravda" published an article by V. Mikhailov entitled: "China - A Great World Power."

The article stated: Recently, various reactionary groups have intensified their activities to undermine the Geneva Conference, oppose the People's China, and oppose the possibility of further easing international tensions that has emerged. In the United States, Senator Nolan and other individuals hostile to the new China have exposed their aggressive ambitions. They are creating an atmosphere of failure for the Geneva Conference, demanding that the legitimate rights of People's China continue to be disregarded, demanding that it be presented with ultimatums, and that a "policy of strength" be adopted towards it.

The reactionary groups' attempt to greet the Geneva Conference with this stance has aroused the anger of all peace-loving people who hope to resolve Asian issues and improve the international situation. It is obvious that only those who do not want the Geneva Conference to succeed would resort to threats and ultimatums. But it is equally clear that the "policy of strength" advocated in the United States will not bring victory to its planners, who forget that they are dealing with a powerful peace camp; they forget that the policy implemented by People's China is in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of Asian countries; they forget that China's representatives will be speaking for the largest country in the world in Geneva.

The article stated: People's China, which has shaken off the shackles of imperialism and propelled millions of people into a life engaged in constructive endeavors, is an advanced and powerful nation in Asia. Of course, even in the past, the great Chinese people had a great influence on the people of their Asian neighbors. But now, due to the victory of the people's revolution and the subsequent achievements in building a new country, China's role in the process of human progress and development has been incomparably enhanced.

The article pointed out: Despite the enemy's use of various conspiracies, all the achievements of People's China and its peaceful foreign policy are having an increasingly significant impact on the current development of Asia, the Far East, and international relations around the world. China's efforts to stop the Korean War and the signing of the armistice agreement have shown the world that without the direct participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve any major problem in international life, and it is impossible to solve any problem in Asia. All this shows that the "strength" policy implemented by the US ruling clique against the great China will not bring the US imperialists the results they expect. The United States has not succeeded in weakening China, nor has it succeeded in isolating or suffocating China through blockade. Many clear-headed people in the capitalist world have understood that the "strength" policy is a futile effort. Another policy of the American reactionary groups – the policy of "non-recognition" of China – has also gone bankrupt. The indestructible strength of the people's regime and the remarkable victories in China's economic and cultural construction are undeniable facts. Dozens of countries have established trade relations with People's China. Twenty-five countries, large and small, with a population of about one billion, have established or are establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

The article continued: Today, the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, with the participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are about to open a conference in Geneva to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and, with the participation of relevant countries, to restore peace in Indochina. China will participate in the conference on an equal footing with other major powers. World opinion believes that the participation of the People's Republic of China on an equal footing with other major powers in the Geneva Conference is a very important factor in the struggle to ease international tensions.

The Paris "Weekly Outlook" pointed out: "The most important result of the Berlin Conference is that People's China has stepped onto the international stage politically and economically, and the international situation continues to ease." The agreement to convene the Geneva Conference has aroused enthusiastic reactions in Asia. Indian political activist Kalelkar wrote about the role of People's China:
	"We are proud of the rejuvenation of China, and excited to have such a great, strong, and highly cultured neighbor with whom we can coexist peacefully." Indonesia's "People's Daily" wrote in an article commenting on the Geneva Conference: "All disputed issues, such as the Korean issue, the Indochina issue, the issue of the danger of the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, or the issue of American aggression against Pakistan, and all other Asian issues, can only be thoroughly resolved with the participation of the People's Republic of China." The source of this friendship of the Asian peoples towards the new China is the great achievements this young republic has made in creative peaceful construction, and the Chinese people's unswerving struggle for peace. No conspiracies of the enemies of peace can shake the trust of the Asian peoples, who support and endorse the People's Republic of China's policy of consolidating world peace, in the People's Republic of China.

### 中国——伟大的世界大国——“真理报”刊载的文章的摘要

    中国——伟大的世界大国
    ——“真理报”刊载的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“真理报”刊载了维·米海耶夫的一篇论文，题目是：“中国——伟大的世界大国”。
    文章说：近来，各种反动集团为了破坏日内瓦会议、反对人民中国、反对已经出现的国际紧张局势进一步缓和的可能性而加紧展开了活动。在美国，参议员诺兰及其他敌视新中国的人暴露了自己的侵略野心，他们在制造日内瓦会议失败的空气，要求今后依然不考虑人民中国的合法权利，要求向它提出最后通牒，对它采用“实力政策”。
    反动集团以这种立场来迎接日内瓦会议的企图，引起了所有希望解决亚洲问题从而改善国际局势的爱好和平的人们的愤怒。很明显，只有不想让日内瓦会议成功的人才会动用威胁和最后通牒的手段。但是同样明显的是：在美国所宣传的“实力政策”不会给它的策划者带来胜利，这些人忘记了他们是和强大的和平阵营打交道；忘记了人民中国所实行的政策是符合于亚洲各国人民的根本利益的；他们忘记了中国的代表将在日内瓦代表世界上最大的国家说话。
    文章说：摆脱了帝国主义的桎梏并推动了千百万人民投入从事建设性努力的生活的人民中国是亚洲的一个先进的强大的国家。当然，就是在过去，伟大的中国人民也曾给予亚洲各邻国的人民以巨大的影响。但是现在，由于人民革命的胜利及随后在建设新国家中所取得的成就，中国在人类进步发展过程中的作用是无比地提高了。
    文章指出：尽管敌人使用种种阴谋，人民中国的全部成就与和平的外交政策对当前亚洲的发展、对远东以及全世界的国际关系发生着日益巨大的影响。中国为停止朝鲜战争所作的努力以及停战协定的签订向全世界表明：如果没有中华人民共和国直接参加，就不可能解决国际生活中的任何一个重大问题，不可能解决亚洲的任何一个问题。这一切说明，美国统治集团对伟大的中国所实行的“实力”政策不会给美帝国主义者带来他们所预期的结果。美国想削弱中国没有成功，想用封锁来孤立中国或窒息中国也没有成功。资本主义世界中许多头脑清醒的人都已理解到“实力”政策是白费心机的。美国反动集团的另外一个方针——“不承认”中国的政策也破产了。人民政权不可摧毁的坚固，中国经济建设和文化建设中卓著的胜利都是无可置辩的事实。数十个国家和人民中国建立了贸易关系。拥有约十亿人口的二十五个大小国家与中华人民共和国建立了或正在建立外交关系。
    文章接着说：今天，英国、美国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国的代表在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加之下为和平解决朝鲜问题以及在有关国家参加之下为恢复印度支那和平问题而举行的会议就要在日内瓦开幕了。中国将和其他大国一道以平等地位来参加会议。世界舆论认为，中华人民共和国和其他大国一道以平等地位来参加日内瓦会议是争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中的一个很重要的因素。
    巴黎的“展望周报”指出：“柏林会议最重要的成果就是人民中国在政治上和经济上走上了国际舞台，以及国际局势的继续缓和。”召开日内瓦会议的协议引起了亚洲热烈的反应。印度的政治活动家卡里尔卡谈到人民中国的作用时写道：
  “我们为中国的复兴而感到骄傲，并因有这样一个伟大的、壮大的、具有高度文化的邻邦而感到兴奋，我们能和它友好共处。”印尼的“人民日报”在其评日内瓦会议的一篇文章中写道：“一切的争执的问题，像朝鲜问题、印度支那问题，又像关于日本帝国主义侵略再起的危险的问题，或者是美国侵略巴基斯坦的问题和一切其他亚洲问题，只有在中华人民共和国参加解决的条件下，才能得到彻底的解决。”亚洲各国人民对新中国的这种友情的泉源，就是这一年青的共和国在创造性的和平建设中所取得的巨大成就，以及中国人民坚持不渝的争取和平的斗争。和平的敌人的任何阴谋诡计都不能使拥护和支持中华人民共和国巩固世界和平的政策的亚洲各国人民对中华人民共和国的信任有所动摇。
