    National Conference in London Opposes the Rearmament of West Germany

    Opposition to the “European Army” Grows in France and Italy

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The National Conference in Britain against the rearmament of West Germany, initiated by the British Peace Committee, opened in London on April 3 and closed on April 4. More than 250 representatives from 136 organizations participated in the conference. Participants—Communist Party members, Conservative Party members, Labour Party members, and representatives from various trade unions and public organizations—discussed the threat of the revival of German militarism under the guise of the "European Defense Community."

    Physicist Dr. Burhop delivered a speech at the meeting, criticizing the United States for its unwillingness to resolve the issue of banning weapons of mass destruction, which the people of the world hoped to resolve, within the United Nations. He believed that the Western propaganda claiming that the solution to this problem was obstructed by the Soviet Union was a complete lie. Dr. Burhop proposed a motion requiring major powers to conclude an agreement on banning the use of atomic weapons. The meeting unanimously adopted this proposal.

    J.G. Pritt, a member of the World Peace Council, then gave a report on the German issue. He said that the ruling groups in the United States should be responsible for delaying the resolution of the German issue on a peaceful and democratic basis, because they needed an armed West Germany to prepare for a war against the Soviet Union. Pritt vehemently condemned the West's "policy of strength," saying that it was an arbitrary policy and an unreasonable method of rejecting all negotiations.

    Subsequently, the participating representatives unanimously adopted a resolution expressing their unanimous opinion. The resolution stated: "This conference reiterates its view that rearming West Germany and incorporating it into the 'European Defense Community' will increase the threat of war in Europe, hinder the peaceful reunification of Germany, and revive German militarism and Nazism; doing so will not only fail to bring security to Western Europe, but will only harm our security and freedom, as well as their own." The resolution pointed out that the Berlin Conference did not reach an agreement on the German issue "mainly because the Western foreign ministers attended the Berlin Conference with the determination to rearm West Germany and were unwilling to abandon, or even extend, their plans." The representatives declared: "We believe that the German issue and the European issue can only be resolved through a four-power agreement, and negotiations must continue. This agreement on the peaceful reunification of Germany, without it joining any military alliance, can ease international tensions and create conditions for general disarmament in Europe and the rest of the world." The resolution called on the British people to unite under the slogan: "Stop German rearmament and achieve peace in Europe!"

    The participating representatives also unanimously adopted another resolution welcoming the upcoming Geneva Conference; because the continued holding of international negotiations is in line with the deep and ardent wishes of the people of all countries and is a victory for the forces of peace.

    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] (TASS dispatch from Paris): Many municipal council members and provincial council members in France have participated in the movement against arming West Germany and against incorporating French troops into the "European Defense Community." Activists from the Socialist Party and other organizations are also actively participating in this movement.

      “l'Humanité” reported: In Drôme, 462 municipal council members have expressed their opposition to ratifying the Paris Treaty. In Indre, 80 mayors and their representatives, 8 provincial council members, and hundreds of municipal council members protested against the establishment of the "European Army." In Sarthe, 250 municipal council members, 13 mayors, and 5 members of parliament opposed the establishment of the "European Defense Community."

    Many members of the Socialist Party, disregarding the attitude of the upper leadership headed by Guy Mollet, who advocated ratifying the Paris Treaty, joined the ranks opposing the "European Army." Recently, more than half of the Socialist Party members of the National Assembly jointly issued a booklet opposing the "European Army" treaty in its current form, and requested that Socialist Party members be allowed to vote freely without being bound by party discipline when the parliament votes on whether to ratify the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. The Socialist Party municipal council member of La Voulte-sur-Rhône in Ardèche and the deputy mayor of Épinay-sur-Seine opposed the establishment of the "European Defense Community" and the arming of Germany. Jean Brochérelane, the leader of the Socialist Party in Ain, published an article in a local newspaper saying: "Ordinary members of the Socialist Party are unwilling to blindly agree to the heinous plan of establishing the European Defense Community."

    The Union of Independent Action Centers of the Paris District, the "Young Republic" Party, the People's Liberation Movement, and the Progressive Republican League also held a joint meeting. At the meeting, a resolution was passed calling on everyone to take joint action to oppose the establishment of the "European Defense Community" or the arming of West Germany in any other form, demanding an end to the war in Indochina and immediate negotiations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and demanding the pursuit of a policy of national independence.

    [Xinhua News Agency, April 4th] (TASS dispatch from Rome): The Italian National Peace Council held a meeting on the 1st and 2nd to discuss the domestic situation in Italy and the struggle against ratifying the "European Defense Community" treaty. Representatives from various democratic organizations in Italy also participated in this council meeting.

    Council Secretary Pajetta emphasized in his speech that the movement against the arming of West Germany in Italy has taken various forms and included the broadest strata of the people. People who had previously stood outside the struggle for peace, such as court officials, lawyers, supporters of the so-called "European Federalist Movement," reserve officers, and many supporters of ruling parties, have all joined this movement.

    Sereni, a member of the World Peace Council, talked about expanding the methods of struggle against Italy's participation in the "European Defense Community" and organizing a movement against the use of atomic weapons.

    Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, said that the General Confederation of Labor would support all proposals against the establishment of the "European Defense Community" and advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons. Rossi, Chairman of the Italian Women's League, said that Italian women will stand at the forefront of the struggle to eliminate the threat of a new war.

    伦敦举行英国反对重新武装西德全国会议
    法意两国反对“欧洲军”的运动正日益壮大
    据新华社讯：由英国和平委员会发起的英国反对重新武装西德全国会议，已于四月三日在伦敦开幕，四日闭幕。参加会议的有一百三十六个团体的二百五十多名代表。参加会议的人——共产党党员、保守党党员、工党党员以及各工会组织与公众组织的代表——讨论了德国军国主义在“欧洲防务集团”的伪装下复活的威胁。
    物理学家柏贺浦博士在会上发表演说，斥责美国不愿意在联合国中解决为全世界人民所希望解决的禁止大规模毁灭性武器的问题。他认为西方宣传所谓这个问题的解决受到苏联阻碍的说法是个弥天大谎。柏贺浦博士提出一个提案，要求各大国缔结一个关于禁止使用原子武器问题的协定。会议一致通过了这个提案。
    世界和平理事会理事普里特接着就德国问题作了报告。他说，拖延在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题的责任，应由美国的统治集团来负，因为他们需要一个武装的西德来准备反苏战争。普里特猛烈斥责西方的“实力政策”，他说这是一种独断的政策，是拒绝一切谈判的蛮不讲理的办法。
    接着，与会代表一致通过了一项决议，表达他们一致的意见。决议说：“本会议重申它的看法，就是：重新武装西德和把它并入‘欧洲防务集团’将会增加欧洲战争的威胁，阻挠德国的和平统一，复活德国军国主义和纳粹主义；这样做非但不能给西欧带来安全，反而只会损害我们的安全和自由以及他们自己的安全和自由。”决议指出，柏林会议在德国问题上没有获致协议，“主要是由于西方外长们是抱着一定要重新武装西德的决心和不愿放弃、甚至要延续他们的计划的态度去参加柏林会议的。”与会代表宣称：“我们认为德国问题和欧洲问题只有通过四国协议来解决，必须继续进行谈判。这种和平统一德国、不使它加入任何军事联盟的协议可以缓和国际紧张局势，并为欧洲以及世界其余地方的普遍裁减军备创造条件。”决议号召英国人民团结在这样一个口号下：“制止德国重新武装，实现欧洲和平！”
    与会代表也一致通过了另一个决议，欢迎即将举行的日内瓦会议；因为国际谈判的继续举行符合于各国人民的深切的、热烈的愿望，并且是和平力量的胜利。
    【新华社五日讯】　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国许多市政委员会委员和省议会议员都参加了反对武装西德、反对把法国军队并入“欧洲防务集团”的运动。社会党及其他一些组织的活动分子，也积极参加这个运动。
      “人道报”报道：德罗摩省有四百六十二个市政委员会委员表示反对批准巴黎条约。昂德尔省有八十个市长和他们的代表、八个省议会议员以及几百个市政委员会委员抗议成立“欧洲军”。萨尔特省有二百五十个市政委员会委员、十三个市长和五个议会议员反对成立“欧洲防务集团”。
    许多社会党党员不顾以居伊·摩勒为首的上层领导机构主张批准巴黎条约的态度，参加到反对
  “欧洲军”的队伍中来。最近，国民议会的社会党议员中，有半数以上联合发出一个小册子，反对现有形式的“欧洲军”条约，并且要求在议会表决是否批准波恩条约和巴黎条约时社会党议员可以自由投票而不受党的纪律约束。阿尔代歇省拉琴蒂埃的社会党市政委员和塞纳河畔厄比纳尔的副市长都反对成立“欧洲防务集团”和武装德国。安省社会党领袖让·布罗歇兰在地方报纸上发表文章说：“社会党普通党员不愿意闭着眼睛同意成立欧洲防务集团的罪恶计划。”
    巴黎区的独立行动中心联合会、“青年共和”党、人民解放运动和进步共和联盟也举行联席会议，会上通过决议，号召大家采取联合行动来反对成立“欧洲防务集团”或以其他任何形式武装西德，要求停止印度支那战争并且立即和越南民主共和国谈判，要求奉行民族独立的政策。
    【新华社四日讯】　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利全国和平理事会在一日和二日举行会议，讨论意大利国内形势和反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约斗争的问题。参加这次理事会会议的，还有意大利各民主组织的代表。
    理事会书记巴叶塔在发言中强调指出，反对武装西德的运动在意大利采取了各种不同的方式，包括了最广泛阶层的人民。过去一直站在争取和平的斗争之外的人们，如法院官员、律师、所谓“欧洲联邦运动”的拥护者、后备军官和许多执政党派的拥护者都参加了这个运动。
    世界和平理事会理事塞伦尼谈到了扩大反对意大利参加“欧洲防务集团”和组织反对使用原子武器的运动的斗争方法。
    意大利总工会总书记维多里奥说，总工会将支持一切反对建立“欧洲防务集团”和主张禁止原子武器的建议。意大利妇女联盟主席罗西说，意大利妇女将站在消除新战争威胁的斗争的前列。
