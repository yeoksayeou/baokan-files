Department stores in various parts of Northwest China are conscientiously overcoming the past shortcoming of "summer clothing arriving in autumn," and have advanced the purchase of a large number of summer goods, and have begun selling them to urban and rural consumers in various places.

Department stores in various parts of Northwest China have this year conducted timely investigations and studies on the needs of people in various places for summer goods. In February, the Xi'an City Department Store organized an investigation team to go deep into government offices, organizations, schools, etc., to understand the requirements of people of all strata for the colors and varieties of summer goods; department stores and state-owned stores in Ningxia Province, Xianyang, Shaanxi, and other places also studied the time and characteristics of local people's needs for summer goods through seminars with cooperative cadres. According to the needs of people in various places, the Northwest District Company of China Department Store Company timely and vigorously organized sources of goods, and in the first quarter, it transferred in a large number of various kinds of shirts, vests and other commodities, and promptly allocated them to sales units in various places. In early March, the company organized a large number of shirts, sock covers, mosquito nets, bed sheets and other commodities in East China and other places. These goods have now been successively transported to various parts of Northwest China and have begun to be sold.

The quantity of summer goods prepared by department stores in various parts of Northwest China this year is quite sufficient, and the colors and varieties are also relatively new and complete. For example, the number of bed sheets that have now been prepared is double the actual sales volume in the second quarter of last year, the number of towels has increased by 34.17% compared with the actual sales volume in the second and third quarters of last year, and the number of shirts has also increased by 137% compared with the actual sales volume in the second and third quarters of last year. A large number of bamboo-shell hot water bottles, scissors, and razors, which sell quickly in rural areas, have also been prepared.

    西北各地百货公司提前调进夏季商品
    西北区各地百货公司认真克服过去“秋来汗衫到”的缺点，提前调进大批夏季商品，并开始销售给各地城乡消费者。
    西北各地百货公司今年及时调查研究了各地人民对夏季商品的需要情况。西安市百货公司在二月份组织调查小组，深入机关、团体、学校等，了解了各阶层人民对夏季商品花色、品种的要求；宁夏省、陕西咸阳等地的百货公司、国营商店也都通过邀集合作社干部座谈等方式，研究了当地人民需要夏季商品的时间和特点等。根据各地人民的需要，中国百货公司西北区公司及时大力组织货源，在第一季度即调进大批各种各样的衬衣、背心等商品，并及时调拨给各地销售单位。三月初，该公司又在华东等地组织了大批衬衣、袜套、蚊帐、床单等商品。这些货物，现在已陆续运到西北各地，并已开始销售。
    西北各地百货公司今年准备的夏季货物数量相当充足，花色、品种也比较新颖、齐全。如现已备妥的床单比去年第二季度实际销售数量增加了一倍，毛巾比去年第二、三两季度实际销售量增加百分之三十四点一七，衬衣也比去年第二、三两季度实际销售量增加百分之一百三十七。在农村中销售很快的竹壳热水瓶和剪刀、剃头刀等，也准备了很多。
