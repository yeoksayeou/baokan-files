Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th – Within the five days from April 1st to April 5th, the US side violated the Armistice Agreement by repeatedly launching armed attacks and shelling our military control areas and the Demilitarized Zone. At the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held its 40th meeting on April 7th. At the meeting, General Li Xiangchao, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding these violations of the Armistice Agreement.

    General Li Xiangchao pointed out that on April 3rd, the US military authority stationed in Munsan dispatched US military personnel Kim Jeong-geum, Kim Kyung-rip, Kim Cheol, and two others, carrying US-made automatic rifles and carbines, to invade our area to conduct hostile activities. Led by an American officer, they rode in a medium-sized truck to Baekhak-dong, and then illegally entered the Demilitarized Zone, crossed the Military Demarcation Line, and invaded the area managed by our side in the Demilitarized Zone adjacent to the Military Armistice Commission headquarters, at approximately 37 degrees 57 minutes 27 seconds North latitude and 126 degrees 42 minutes 47 seconds East longitude, and opened fire on our civil police. Kim Kyung-rip, one of the US military personnel dispatched, was shot and killed by our civil police in self-defense, and Kim Jeong-geum was captured on the spot. On April 4th, members of both sides of the Second Joint Observer Team conducted a joint investigation of the incident at the scene. During the joint investigation, material evidence and witness testimony, including that of the US military personnel Kim Jeong-geum captured by our civil police, confirmed the US's armed attack in violation of Articles 6 and 12 of the Armistice Agreement.

    On April 4th, the US side again dispatched US military personnel Jeon Hong-woo, Ryu Bok-soo, Seo Hak-seon, Jeong Ki-jun, and Lee Sa-ryong, and two others, to the vicinity north of Bonghwa-ri in our military control area, attempting to carry out missions of attack and kidnapping. They departed from the vicinity of Saijeong-dong on the US side on the evening of the 4th, and landed west of Bonghwa-ri, southeast of Yeon’an, around 1:00 AM on the 5th. Two of them have been captured by our side and have confessed all the details, confirming that they were US armed personnel dispatched by the 21st Detachment of the 90th Area Team of the US "HID" forces to conduct hostile activities in our military control area.

    In addition to the above incidents of armed attacks in the Demilitarized Zone and armed intrusion into our military control area, the US side blatantly violated Article 6 of the Armistice Agreement by shelling the vicinity northwest of Height 851 in the northern part of the Demilitarized Zone at approximately 1:00 PM on April 1st, 1954. The Fifth Joint Observer Team has conducted a joint investigation of this US violation of the Armistice Agreement. The US side admitted that the shells came from the US side and were manufactured by the US. The results of the on-site investigation proved that this incident was a destructive action violating the Armistice Agreement, carried out by the US using US-made 4.2-inch chemical mortars against the northern part of the Demilitarized Zone under our management.

    General Li Xiangchao pointed out at the meeting that guaranteeing the cessation of all hostile acts is the solemn responsibility of both parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, since the Armistice Agreement came into effect, the US side has dispatched a large number of special agents to infiltrate our area through the Demilitarized Zone or the coast. US aircraft frequently intrude into our airspace, blatantly disregarding the express provisions of Articles 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, and 17 of the Armistice Agreement, and constantly engage in hostile activities in our area. In response to this, our side has repeatedly presented facts and lodged protests or warnings to the US side, demanding that the US side immediately take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. However, the US side not only shows no remorse for past violations of the agreement, but also continues to carry out such provocative acts with increasing intensity on April 1st, 3rd, and 5th. This action by the US side is clearly intended to create incidents to threaten the stability of the Korean Armistice, so as to intensify international tensions and obstruct the progress of the Geneva Conference. The US side must bear serious responsibility for its crimes and the consequences arising therefrom.

    李相朝将军抗议美方违反停战协定的罪行
    【新华社开城七日电】在一九五四年四月一日至五日五天之内，美方违反停战协定，连续三次武装袭击并炮击我方军事控制地区及非军事区。军事停战委员会在朝中方面建议召开之下，于四月七日举行第四十次会议。朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上，就美方这些违反停战协定事件向美方提出严重抗议。
    李相朝将军指出，四月三日，驻汶山的美方军事机关派遣美方军事人员金正今、金庆立、金哲等五人，携带美式自动步枪及卡宾枪侵入我方地区进行敌对行为。他们由一个美国军官率领乘坐中型卡车至白鹤洞，然后非法进入非军事区，越过军事分界线，侵入邻近军事停战委员会总部区的我方管理的非军事区北纬三七度五七分二七秒，东经一二六度四二分四七秒附近，并开枪袭击我方民政警察。美方派遣的军事人员金庆立被我方民政警察还枪击毙，金正今被当场捕获。四月四日，第二联合观察小组的双方成员曾到现场对这一事件进行共同调查。在共同调查的过程中，物证和人证，包括被我方民政警察捕获的美方军事人员金正今在内，都已证实美方这一违反停战协定第六款和第十二款的武装袭击事件。
    四月四日，美方又派遣美方军事人员全洪禹、柳福秀、徐学善、郑基俊及李士龙等五人到我方军事控制地区烽火里以北附近，企图执行袭击和绑架的任务。他们于四日晚自美方四井洞附近出发，五日一时左右在我方延安东南烽火里以西登陆，其中的两名已被我方捕获，供出全部情况，证实了他们是美方“HID”部队第九十地区队二十一派遣队所派到我方军事控制地区进行敌对行为的美方武装人员。
    除上述武装攻击非军事区和武装侵入我方军事控制地区的事件外，美方又悍然违反停战协定第六款，在一九五四年四月一日下午一时左右，炮击非军事区北部的八五一高地西北附近。第五联合观察小组对美方这一违反停战协定事件已进行了共同调查，美方承认炮弹来自美方，并且是美方所制造。现场调查的结果证明了此一事件是美方以美制四点二英寸化学迫击炮向我方管理的非军事区北部所进行的违反停战协定的破坏行动。
    李相朝中将在会上指出，保证停止一切敌对行为是朝鲜停战协定缔约双方的庄严责任。但美方自停战协定生效以来，派遣了大批特务通过非军事区或海岸侵入我方地区，美方飞机经常侵入我领空，悍然不顾停战协定第六、七、九、十二、十四与十七各款的明文规定，不断向我方地区进行敌对行为。对此，我方过去曾列举事实，多次向美方提出抗议或警告，要求美方立即采取有效措施以保证嗣后不再发生类似事件。但美方不但对以往的违反协定的事件毫无悔过之意，反于四月一日、三日、五日接二连三，日益猖狂地进行此种挑衅行为。美方这种行动显然是有意制造事件来威胁朝鲜停战的稳定，以便加剧国际紧张局势来阻挠日内瓦会议的进行。美方对于它的这种罪行以及由此而产生的后果必须负起严重责任。
