    Guo Hou Banner Rectifies Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations to Launch Production Increase Movement

    In order to complete this year's production increase task, Guoerluosi Hou Banner in Heilongjiang Province is actively rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations and promoting high-yield experiences. This year, the entire banner has newly established 70 agricultural cooperatives, bringing the total to 101, including the old cooperatives. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 5.2% of the banner's total peasant households. More than 3,100 mutual aid teams across the banner have undergone universal rectification. Currently, 99% of peasant households have been organized. This year, the banner plans to produce 970,000 shi of grain, with an average yield per hectare increasing to 8 shi, a 9.5% increase compared to 1952.

    In order to ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan, the Guoerluosi Hou Banner Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to first consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations. For the new cooperatives, the primary task is to eliminate ideological obstacles preventing members from increasing production and to formulate production increase plans, while also establishing labor organizations and various systems. For the old cooperatives, the goal is to universally implement the contract work system through summarizing and inspecting work, and resolving outstanding issues. Mutual aid teams are required to universally formulate production increase plans and methods, and to rationally revise mutually beneficial systems. Secondly, the banner will further promote the technological production increase movement, promote the technical experiences developed last year, and also require vigorous efforts to find fertilizer sources, improve the method of filtering manure, and expand the fertilization area by about 10% on the existing basis. Recently, the Banner Committee has organized more than 100 cadres from government organs to go deep into various villages and settlements to inspect and promote spring plowing work.

    郭后旗整顿互助合作组织开展增产运动
    黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗积极整顿互助合作组织，推广丰产经验，为完成今年增产任务准备条件。全旗今年新建了七十个农业合作社，连老社在内共已有一百零一个社，入社农户已达全旗农户的百分之五点二。全旗三千一百多个互助组普遍经过整顿。目前百分之九十九的农户都已组织起来。全旗今年计划生产粮食九十七万石，平均每垧产量提高到八石，比一九五二年提高百分之九点五。
    为了保证今年增产计划的完成，中共郭尔罗斯后旗旗委决定首先巩固、提高互助合作组织，对新社主要是扫除社员增产思想障碍，订出增产计划，同时建立劳动组织和各种制度；对老社是通过总结检查工作，解决遗留问题，普遍推行包工制；对互助组要求普遍订立增产计划和办法，合理修订互利制度。其次是进一步开展技术增产运动，推行去年发展了的技术经验，并要求大力寻找肥源，改进滤粪方法，在现有基础上扩大施肥面积百分之十左右。最近，旗委已组织机关干部一百多人分别深入各村、屯检查推动春耕工作。
