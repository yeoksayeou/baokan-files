The Nanbatan Canal project in Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, has been successfully excavated. From now on, 100,000 mu of grassland on both sides of the canal, "more often seen with reed catkins than people," will become fertile cotton fields. Currently, the tractors of the state-owned Huaihai Farm have begun to gallop on the vast grassland, reclaiming wasteland in preparation for planting cotton this year. The Nanbatan Canal is located north of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and is approximately 60 li in length. The entire project involves more than 2,536,000 cubic meters of earthwork. More than 47,000 migrant workers and pump operators from the three counties of Binhai, Funing, and Sheyang participated in this project. The Nanbatan Canal involves digging a canal on flat ground, which is a relatively arduous project. However, the enthusiasm of the migrant workers and workers was extremely high. The Weidang Team of migrant workers completed 20 days of tasks in seven days; and braved strong winds and rain for two consecutive nights to rush to build a tidal barrier. Digging rotten silt was the most difficult part of the entire project. The silt was like a thin paste, impossible to dig with a shovel or load into a basket. Communist Party member Li Dabang took the lead in jumping into the waist-deep silt pond, ignoring the biting cold to rush to dig rotten silt. All the migrant workers in the detachment followed suit under his influence. Pump operators Xu Caiyuan and Ding Wenxiong stayed up for six consecutive nights, sleeping only one or two hours each night, to rush to drain the accumulated water in the Longgou ditch. Thanks to the intense labor of the workers and migrant workers for more than a month, the entire project was successfully completed by the end of March.

    江苏滨海县开挖南八滩渠
    十万亩草滩将成棉田
    江苏省滨海县南八滩渠工程已开挖成功。从此，两岸十万亩“多见芦花少见人”的草滩，就要变成了富饶的棉田。目前，国营淮海农场的拖拉机已开始在广阔的草滩上奔驰，开垦荒地，准备今年播种棉花。南八滩渠在苏北灌溉总渠以北，全长约六十华里，全部工程计二百五十三万六千多公土方、参加这个工程的有滨海、阜宁、射阳三县的四万七千多民工和抽水机工人，南八滩渠是在平地上开挖一条渠，工程较为艰巨，但是，民工和工人的劳动热情极为高涨。苇荡中队的民工在七天内就完成了二十天的任务；并接连两夜冒着大风雨抢打拦潮圩。挖烂淤是全部工程中最艰苦的部分，淤土像稀浆糊一样，挖不上锹，装不上筐，共产党员李达邦，带头跳下齐腰深的淤塘，不顾寒冷刺骨抢挖烂淤，全分队民工在他影响下也都跟着跳下去。抽水机工人许才元、丁文雄为了突击排除龙沟积水，连熬了六个夜晚，每夜只睡一两个钟头。由于工人和民工们这样紧张地劳动了一个多月，全部工程已于三月底胜利完工。
