    The election work in the 2,424 basic-level units of the 83 counties and cities in Xinjiang Province has been victoriously completed.
    The people of all ethnic groups living on this one-sixth of the motherland's territory have actively participated in the general election movement with high patriotic enthusiasm. Although the area here is vast and the people live scattered, the proportion of voters participating in the election has still reached a high level. According to statistics from 654 basic-level units in 56 counties, the number of participants in the election reached more than 89 percent of the total number of voters. In the southern agricultural region of Xinjiang, where the Uyghur people live in concentrated communities, more than 95 percent of voters participated in the election. Women of all ethnic groups have also fully exercised their democratic rights. According to incomplete statistics from 29 townships in five counties, the number of women participating in the election accounted for more than 87 percent of the total number of female voters. In Kucha, Baicheng, Wensu, Awat and other counties, the proportion of female voters participating in the election reached more than 95 percent. On the day of the election in Sulagong Township, Yining County, the weather suddenly changed, with wind and snow, but people got up before dawn, put on new clothes, and rushed to the polling place to participate in the election, carrying instruments such as tamburs and dombras. Suphbak Mullah, a 118-year-old farmer, also rode his donkey to the election meeting place. When the old man raised his hand to vote, he burst into tears and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    In this general election movement, all localities have paid attention to the breadth of representation. Among the 341 people's representatives elected in Urumqi City, there are 11 ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Han, Mongolian, Tatar, Uzbek, Manchu, Sibe, Kirgiz and Russian, including workers, peasants, government cadres, teachers, business people, religious figures and other people from all walks of life. In the election, Communist Party members were loved and supported by the broad masses of people. Maimaitirozi, the head of the Hairak Township in Artush County and a Communist Party member, was called a good township head "chosen from the gold" by the people of the township. Last August, during a flash flood, Maimaitirozi jumped into the raging flood and led the people to rescue the dam, and won the honorary title of "Batur" (hero) for defending the harvest. Many excellent cadres who have been tempered through social reform struggles have been re-elected. According to statistics from 312 townships, among the 7,088 people elected, 5,248 were re-elected.
    The general election movement has improved the production enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups. The People's Congresses held in various basic-level units have taken the development of various production activities in their respective regions as the central topic. At the first People's Congress of Hairak Township in Artush County, a resolution was made to increase wheat production by 20 catties per mu and corn production by 30 catties per mu in 1954. In order to ensure the completion of the production increase plan, the people of Hairak Township actively participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The number of mutual aid teams in the township increased from 30 before the general election to 40 now. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinhua News Agency: The basic-level election work in Hubei Province has basically ended. The newly elected cadres and people's representatives are actively leading the masses to carry out various tasks with high enthusiasm.
    According to statistics in early April, except for Yichang, Huangshi, Xiangfan and other three cities and a few villages that are still in the process of election, the province has completed the election in 11,628 basic-level units and the entire Shashi City. The units that have been completed account for more than 94 percent of the province's basic-level election units. Due to the education of the General Line, the voters have carefully and prudently elected the people they are most satisfied with as people's representatives. Among the 35 representatives elected in Chunhe Township, Wuchang County, 10 are Communist Party members, who have all won the greatest trust and support from the voters. The heads of the Hongyan, Xinxin and Chunhe agricultural production cooperatives in this township were all elected as people's representatives; 18 of the 82 mutual aid team leaders in the township were elected as people's representatives. Rao Xingli, the head of the famous Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, was also elected as a people's representative with extremely high votes.
    The basic-level units that have completed the basic-level elections have all convened the People's Congress, elected the members of the township and town people's government and the township and town heads and deputy heads, and discussed and approved the resolution on developing production at the congress. After the meeting, the newly elected cadres and people's representatives went deep into various places to convey and promote the people to realize these resolutions, making a new atmosphere appear in the vast rural areas and towns. In Yingshan County, due to the leading role of cadres, the old habit of "looking for something to do after the Lantern Festival (the fifteenth day of the first lunar month)" has been broken, making spring plowing and production earlier than in previous years. The county's 11 districts have currently opened five new ponds, repaired more than 880 old ponds and old dikes, and repaired 52 dams. Cadres and people's representatives of Xiaojia'ao Township in Luotian County led the Wangjiaban farmers to dig a large ditch 50 zhang long, 5 chi wide, and more than 4 chi deep, turning more than 180 mu of half-yield paddy fields that suffer from waterlogging every year into high-yield good fields, realizing the wishes that local farmers have not realized for 20 years. The peasants joyfully sang: "Opening this ditch turns half-yield into bumper harvest. Thanks to the good cadres we elected, we support them." (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆省基层选举工作全部完成
    湖北省基层选举基本结束
    新疆省八十三个县、市的二千四百二十四个基层单位的选举工作，已全部胜利完成。
    居住在这占祖国六分之一土地上的各族人民，都以很高的爱国主义热情积极投入普选运动。这里虽然地区辽阔，人民居住分散，但选民参加选举仍然达到了很高的比例。据五十六个县的六百五十四个基层单位统计，参加选举的人数达到选民总数的百分之八十九以上。维吾尔族聚居的新疆南部农业区，有百分之九十五以上的选民参加了选举。各族妇女也充分行使了她们的民主权力，根据五个县的二十九个乡不完全统计，妇女参加选举的人数占女选民总数的百分之八十七以上。在库车、拜城、温宿、阿瓦提等县，妇女选民参加选举的比例达到百分之九十五以上。伊宁县苏拉宫乡选举的那天，天气突然变化，风雪交加，但人们却在天没亮就起来，换上新衣，带着弹波尔、东不拉等乐器，赶赴选区参加选举。一百一十八岁的农民素甫巴克毛拉，也骑着毛驴赶到选举大会会场。当这位老人举手投票时，激动地流下了眼泪，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”。
    各地在这次普选运动中，都很注意代表的广泛性。乌鲁木齐市选出的三百四十一名人民代表中，包括有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉、蒙古、塔塔尔、乌兹别克、满、锡伯、柯尔克兹和俄罗斯等十一个民族，其中有工人、农民、机关干部、教师、工商界、宗教界及其他阶层的人士。在选举中，共产党员受到广大人民的热爱和拥护。阿图什县哈依拉克乡乡长、共产党员买买提肉孜，被乡里人们称为：“沙里淘金”选出来的好乡长。去年八月，有一次山洪暴发，洪水冲毁了堤坝，买买提肉孜奋不顾身地跳入汹涌的洪水中，领导人民抢救堤坝，得到了保卫丰收的“巴图尔”（英雄）的光荣称号。许多经过社会改革斗争锻炼出来的优秀干部，得到连选连任。根据三百一十二个乡的统计，在选出的七千零八十八人中，有五千二百四十八人是连选连任。
    普选运动提高了各族人民的生产积极性。在各基层单位召开的人民代表大会上，都以开展本区各项生产作为中心议题。阿图什县哈依拉克乡在首次人民代表大会上，作出了一九五四年每亩小麦增产二十斤、每亩包谷增产三十斤的决议。为保证增产计划的完成，哈依拉克乡人民积极参加互助合作组织，全乡互助组由普选前的三十个增加到现在的四十个。　（新华社）
    湖北省基层选举工作已基本结束。新选出的干部和人民代表正以高度的热情，积极带动人民群众进行各项工作。
    据四月上旬统计，湖北省除宜昌、黄石、襄樊等三个市和个别乡村正在选举外，全省已在一万一千六百二十八个基层单位和沙市市全部完成了选举。已经完成的单位占全省基层选举单位的百分之九十四以上。选民们由于受到总路线的教育，都认真慎重地选出了他们最满意的人做人民代表。武昌县春和乡选出的三十五个代表中，有十个是共产党员，他们都得到了选民的最大信任和拥护。这个乡的红焰、新新、春和三个农业生产合作社的社长都当选为人民代表；全乡八十二个互助组长中当选为人民代表的就有十八人。湖北省浠水县著名的饶兴礼农业生产合作社社长饶兴礼，也以极高的票数当选为人民代表。
    已完成基层选举的基层单位，都已召开了人民代表大会，选出了乡、镇人民政府委员和正、副乡、镇长，并在代表大会上讨论通过了发展生产的决议。会后新当选的干部和人民代表，深入各地传达和推动人民实现这些决议，使广大农村、市镇出现了一片新的气象。英山县由于干部带头，打破了历来“过月半（农历正月半），找事干”的老习惯，使春耕生产比往年提早进行。全县十一个区目前已开新塘五口，修旧塘、旧堰八百八十多口，修坝五十二道。罗田县萧家坳乡干部和人民代表领导王家畈农民，挖了一条五十丈长、五尺宽、四尺多深的大沟，使一百八十多亩每年遭受水涝的半收畈田，变为能有高额产量的良田，实现了当地农民二十年来没有实现的愿望，农民们满意地歌颂道：“开了这条沟，半收变丰收，多亏选了好干部，我们来拥护。”　（新华社）
