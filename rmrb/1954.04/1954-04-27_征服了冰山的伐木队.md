A logging team that conquered the ice mountain
From Kashgar, going south for more than four hundred li, there is a large mountain covered with snow and ice all year round, called Qijiaolangzi Mountain, also known as "Ice Mountain." In Xinjiang Province, there is a logging team living at the foot of this "Ice Mountain," and every day they cross this ice mountain, traverse river valleys, and go to a primitive forest more than 6,000 meters above sea level to cut wood.
	Every year in May, the woodcutters set off, because the climate is gradually warming, and the ice near the ground begins to melt. If people are not careful when walking, they will step into an ice cave, and their feet will fall into it, or even half of their body. The ice ladders on the ice mountain have also disappeared, and in some places, even the traces cannot be found, only a layer of ice skin. They temporarily build a "human ladder," and after three or four people go up, they hang down a rope, and then hoist the other people up one by one. After crossing the ice mountain, there is a boundless black pine forest. They put their dry food under the pine trees, and then two people formed a group and started sawing. In the snow, they were so hot that they took off their cotton-padded coats, and the sweat on their bodies soaked their shirts, giving off white heat. When the tall and straight pine tree fell, making a sound that resounded through the valley, a smile of infinite joy appeared on their faces. Then they started arguing:
	"This is a girder for the power plant."
	"No, this is the machine frame for the flour mill."
	"Why use such a thick machine frame? Don't you see that it is the crossbeam for repairing the Yehe Bridge!"...
	This ice mountain was never visited by anyone in the past. The Kirgiz herders have a saying: "The ice mountain is ten thousand feet high, there is only going up and no coming down." Meaning: People who walk on the ice mountain rarely come back alive. But this sentence was completely shattered in front of our brave and tenacious logging team. Now the ice mountain has been conquered, and thousands of logs have been transported down across the ice mountain.

    征服了冰山的伐木队
    从喀什噶尔向南走四百多里，有座终年积雪结冰的大山，名叫七角郎子山，又叫“冰山”。新疆省有一个伐木队，就住在这座“冰山”的脚下，每天翻过这座冰山，越过河谷，到拔海六千多公尺的一座原始大森林里砍伐木料。
    每年五月，砍伐木料的人们就出发了，因为气候逐渐和暖，靠近地面的冰开始溶化，人走着，一不留神，就会踏出个冰窟窿，脚就会掉进去，甚至掉进半个身子。冰山上的冰梯也消了，有的地方连痕迹都找不到，只是一层冰皮，他们就临时搭起个“人梯”，上去三四个人以后，吊下来一条绳子，再把其他的人一个一个吊上去。翻过冰山就是一眼望不见边的黑的松林。他们把干粮放在松树底下，两个人一组两个人一组地就锯起来了。他们在雪地里都热得脱掉了棉袄，身上的汗把衬衣都湿透了，冒着白色的热气。当那高大笔直的松树倒下来，发出响彻山谷的声音时，他们脸上都露出无限高兴的笑容，接着就争论开了：
    “这是发电厂的大梁。”
    “不，这是面粉厂的机器架。”
    “那用上这么粗的机器架？你不看那正是修叶河大桥的横木！”……
    这座冰山过去是从来没有人去过的，柯尔克孜的牧民们流传着这么一句话：“冰山高万丈，有上没有下。”意思是说：走冰山的人，很少能够活着回来。但这句话在我们英勇顽强的伐木队面前完全被粉碎了。现在冰山是被征服了，成千上万的木料，翻过冰山运了下来。
