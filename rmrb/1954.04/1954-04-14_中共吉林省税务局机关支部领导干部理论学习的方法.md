    Methods of Theoretical Study for Leading Cadres of the 机关 Branch of the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau of the CPC
    Wang Zhong
    Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, the 机关 Branch of the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau of the CPC has strengthened its leadership over the theoretical study of cadres, thereby improving the political and theoretical level and ideological awareness of cadres, and ensuring the smooth progress of administrative work.
    The 机关 Branch of the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau mainly adopts the following methods for the theoretical study of leading cadres:
    Treating the theoretical study of leading cadres as a regular
      task of the branch
    Since the publication of the "Instructions on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954" by the CPC Central Committee, the 机关 Branch of the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau has held nine branch committee meetings in nearly a year to discuss how to lead cadres' study, promptly formulated plans for cadres' theoretical study in various periods, regularly checked the cadres' study situation, and promptly discovered and solved the problems that occurred in the cadres' study. During the general line study, the study instructors all went to the countryside, and some students developed the phenomenon of reading books without understanding due to the lack of guidance. After learning about this situation, the branch held a branch committee meeting to study and formulated a plan to improve study, established a study core group to strengthen specific leadership. After the meeting, comrades who were better at connecting with reality were invited to introduce their study experience; the cadre in charge of the agency was invited to make an enlightening report on how to correctly implement the tax policy. In terms of business, the heads of each section were invited to make reports. After the report, the branch held a study core group meeting. It was also pointed out that the core group must inspire everyone to consciously connect and check their work and thinking. In this way, the study of the general line was on the right track.
    At the same time, the branch also frequently reported the cadres' study situation to the administrative responsible cadres, and obtained the attention and support of the administrative leadership. The administrative side ensured that the cadres' study time was not occupied, and gave the cadres who returned from the countryside a certain amount of time to make up lessons. The main administrative responsible cadres also took the initiative to help the branch answer questions for the cadres, and made a report on study issues to all cadres every month. According to preliminary statistics, the main administrative responsible cadres of the agency have made a total of twenty-eight study reports in the past year, which has greatly helped the cadres.
    Cultivate and give play to the role of instructors, strengthen study
      tutoring work
    Doing a good job of tutoring is one of the keys to doing a good job in cadres' theoretical study. When the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau began to organize cadres to study theory, because there were many students and few instructors, the instructors were too busy; sometimes when the instructors were out on official business, no one tutored the cadres' study. Therefore, the tutoring work could not meet the requirements of the students, and the instructors' confidence was not high. In this case, the branch selected nine more instructors, helped the instructors form a tutoring group, and established a bi-monthly meeting system for researching work, thereby giving play to the collective strength of the instructors and improving the tutoring work. For example, before previewing, the tutoring group first studied the content of the lesson, determined the central issues, and how to help everyone conduct self-study and read reference materials; before the discussion, the tutoring group studied how to help comrades write outlines for speeches, and predicted the problems that might occur in the discussion and solutions... The result of doing so not only improved the instructors' work confidence, but also gave better play to the collective role of the instructors.
    Secondly, this helped the instructors meet the requirement of "taking the lead" in learning. The instructors not only did a good job of tutoring, but also improved their theoretical level. Therefore, the general instructors did a good job of pointing out the key points before class, helping everyone to hold good discussion meetings after class, digesting the content taught in large classes, tutoring the cadres' study, and checking the learning effect on time.
    Strengthen ideological leadership, criticize erroneous ideas in study
    Ideological leadership in study is a powerful guarantee for the branch to lead study and strengthen the learning effect. The Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau branch starts from grasping the specific ideological situation of cadres, and promptly discovers and solves problems to ensure study. For example, when starting to study theory, although most cadres welcomed the new learning tasks with a humble attitude, some comrades in the "History of the CPSU (B)" group were afraid of not keeping up; another individual comrade believed that it would take five or six months to study a chapter, and they could learn it "not too far off" (meaning almost the same); cadres in the "Economic Construction" group had the idea of aiming too high, thinking that the "Reader of Common Sense on Economic Construction" could be understood at a glance without studying. In response to this situation, the branch organized everyone to discuss the mobilization report of the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, encouraged everyone to strengthen their confidence to overcome the "roadblocks" in study and overcome complacency and other ideological obstacles, and laid an ideological foundation for theoretical study.
    Strengthen leadership over the study of cadres who are out on duty
    The Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau often has one-third (two-thirds when busy) of its cadres working outside. Therefore, the branch paid attention to strengthening the leadership over the theoretical study of cadres who are out on duty. The specific methods are as follows:
      (1) The branch designates an instructor to specifically help cadres who are out on duty to study. Before the cadres are out on duty, the instructor, according to the nature of the work, working hours and work location of the staff who are out on duty, and in accordance with the branch's study plan, uniformly arranges the study tasks and puts forward study requirements at the meeting of cadres who are out on duty. In addition, cadres who work in one area form study groups, and a special person is assigned to be the study group leader to be responsible for leading the study.
    (2) Sending materials. The branch regularly sends study publications: "Study Magazine", "Current Affairs Handbook", study newsletters, study plans, discussion topics, and lecture notes of large class teachers to cadres who are out on duty for reference. For example, during the general line study, the branch sent the lecture notes of fourteen large classes and various study reference materials, as well as the issues debated by cadres in the bureau in study discussions, to the cadres who were out on duty as study materials. At the same time, the branch was also responsible for answering the difficult questions raised by the cadres who were out on duty. This further promoted the study of cadres who were out on duty. The cadres who went to the countryside reflected: "The branch is so concerned about our study, which is of great help to us. We not only completed our work tasks in the countryside, but also learned theory."
      (3) Make-up lessons. When the cadres who are out on duty return, the branch holds a discussion meeting or conducts individual talks, checks the notes and outlines of speeches, etc., to see if they have carried out the study tasks arranged by the branch, and tests the effect of their study by means of oral examinations. Then, according to the specific situation, the instructors conduct make-up lessons for them, and give them a certain amount of study time.
    Cultivate activists and give play to the role of backbones
    The branch pays attention to cultivating study activists throughout the study process. In the past year, a total of twenty study activists have been cultivated. The main methods of cultivation are: absorbing those who perform actively in study into the study core group, regularly understanding their ideological situation and problems in study, assigning work tasks, helping to solve difficulties in study, etc., so that they can play a backbone role in study. Some cadres disliked the "Reader of Common Sense on Economic Construction" for being too shallow, so they were unwilling to study, or they lacked the spirit of independent thinking and researching problems in study. After learning about this situation, the branch gathered study activists to study how to help these people learn well, and everyone put forward many methods. With the help of activists, many comrades who did not study well before have made progress. For example, Qian Xiuqing overcame his slackening thoughts with the help of activist Wang Daoming. Activist Liu Kerensheng helped Zhang Chengye solve the difficulties in his study.
    Check the learning effect, conduct commendation and criticism
    The branch checked the learning effect on time, strengthened the cadres' consciousness and enthusiasm for learning; at the same time, it could also discover the problems existing in the study and correct them in time. The branch adopted the forms of written tests and oral questions, checking notes and outlines of speeches, writing learning experiences and papers, and typical report meetings to check the learning effect of cadres. After the completion of each study task, a discussion meeting is held, and each comrade talks about their gains after this stage of study, that is, what problems they have understood in terms of theoretical knowledge, what wrong ideas they have corrected on the basis of understanding the problems, what problems still exist now, and how to overcome them in the future, etc. On the basis of the discussion meeting, the branch mobilized everyone to write out their learning gains, and then the branch selected the "learning experiences" that were written better and introduced them through the learning report meeting to encourage everyone's learning enthusiasm. In the past year, the branch also commended five comrades who studied better, and pointed out the direction of efforts for three comrades who did not study well enough, and adopted individual assistance methods to improve their learning enthusiasm.
    In the past year, due to the branch's earnest leadership of the cadres' theoretical study, the cadres' ideological and policy level has been greatly improved; the understanding of problems has also become more comprehensive and profound. Most cadres have basically corrected the wrong ideas that "doing tax work is to make small money and is not promising" and "economic construction has nothing to do with oneself" in their thinking, thereby establishing the view that doing tax work well is directly serving economic construction. With the improvement of ideological awareness, the cadres' enthusiasm for work has been further brought into play, the work style has been improved, the work efficiency has been improved, and the implementation of the administrative plan has been guaranteed.

    中共吉林省税务局机关支部领导干部理论学习的方法
    王中
    中共吉林省税务局机关支部，自“三反”运动后，就加强了对干部理论学习的领导，从而提高了干部的政治理论水平与思想觉悟，保证了行政工作的顺利进行。
    吉林省税务局机关支部，对于领导干部理论学习，主要是采取如下几个方法：
    把领导干部理论学习当做支部的经常
      任务
    吉林省税务局机关支部自中共中央“关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”公布后，在将近一年内，专门召开了九次支委会议讨论如何领导干部学习问题，及时做出了各个时期的干部理论学习的计划，经常检查干部的学习情况，及时发现与解决干部学习中所发生的问题。在总路线学习中，学习辅导员都下乡去了，有些学员因为缺乏辅导而发生了读死书的现象。支部了解这一情况后，就召开支委会议研究，订出了改进学习的计划，成立了学习核心组加强具体领导。会后，还请联系实际较好的同志介绍了自己的学习经验；请本机关负责干部作了关于如何正确执行税收政策的启发报告。在业务方面，又请各科科长作了报告。报告之后，支部又召开了学习核心组会议。并指出核心小组一定要启发大家自觉地联系检查自己的工作和思想，这样，总路线的学习就步入了轨道。
    同时，支部还经常向行政负责干部汇报干部学习情况，取得了行政领导方面的重视和支持。行政方面保证了不占用干部的学习时间，并对下乡回来的干部给予一定的时间补课。行政主要负责干部还主动地帮助支部给干部解答问题，做到每月给全体干部作一次有关学习问题的报告。据初步统计，该机关行政主要负责干部一年来共作了二十八次学习报告，对干部的帮助很大。
    培养与发挥辅导员的作用，加强学习的
      辅导工作
    做好辅导工作，是搞好干部理论学习的关键之一。吉林省税务局开始组织干部学习理论时，因为学员多，辅导员少，辅导员就忙不过来；有时辅导员因公外出，就没有人辅导干部学习，因而辅导工作满足不了学员的要求，辅导员的工作信心也不高。在这种情况下，支部又选拔了九名辅导员，并帮助辅导员组成辅导小组，建立了半月一次的研究工作的会议制度，从而发挥了辅导员的集体力量，提高了辅导工作。比如在预习之前，辅导小组首先研究好课文内容，确定中心问题，以及如何帮助大家进行自修和阅读参考材料；开讨论会之前，辅导小组就研究如何帮助同志们写发言提纲，以及预计在讨论中可能发生的问题和解决的办法……。这样做的结果，不仅提高了辅导员的工作信心，同时更能发挥辅导员的集体作用。
    其次，这样做又帮助辅导员在学习上达到“先走一步”的要求，辅导员不但做好了辅导工作，而且将自己的理论水平也提高了一步。因此，一般的辅导员均做到了课前指重点，课后帮助大家开好讨论会，消化大课讲授内容，辅导干部的学习，按时检查学习效果等工作。
    加强思想领导，批判学习中的错误思想
    在学习中的思想领导，是支部领导学习和加强学习效果的有力保证。吉林省税务局支部，是从掌握干部具体思想情况着手，及时发现与解决问题来保证学习的。例如开始学习理论时，虽然大部分干部以虚心的态度，来迎接新的学习任务；但在“联共（布）党史”组有部分同志，还有些怕跟不上；另有个别同志，认为一章要学五、六个月，怎么也能学个“不大离”（即差不多的意思）；“经济建设”组的干部存在好高鹜远的思想，认为“经济建设常识读本”一看就懂，不用学习。支部针对这种情况，即组织大家座谈了吉林省委宣传部部长的动员报告，鼓励大家坚定信心战胜学习中的“拦路虎”和克服自满等思想障碍，给理论学习打下了思想基础。
    加强对外出干部学习的领导
    吉林省税务局经常有三分之一（忙时有三分之二）的干部外出工作。因此支部注意了加强对外出干部理论学习的领导。其具体方法有以下三点：
      （一）支部指定一名辅导员专门帮助外出干部进行学习。干部在外出前，辅导员就根据外出工作人员的工作性质、工作时间和工作地点，按照支部的学习计划，在外出干部会议上统一布置学习任务，提出学习要求。另外，对到一个地区工作的干部则组成学习小组，并指派专人担任学习组长，负责领导学习。
    （二）寄材料。支部按时把学习刊物：“学习杂志”、“时事手册”、学习通讯、学习计划、讨论题目和大课教员讲授记录，寄给外出的干部参考。如在总路线学习时，支部曾将十四次大课讲授记录和各种学习参考材料、及局里干部在学习讨论中所争论的问题寄给外出的干部，作为学习材料。同时，支部又负责解答了外出的干部提出的疑难问题。这就进一步推动了外出的干部的学习。下乡的干部回来反映：“支部这样关心我们的学习，对我们帮助很大，我们在乡下不但完成了工作任务，而且还能学习理论。”
      （三）补课。当外出的干部回来后，支部即召开座谈会议或进行个别谈话，检查笔记和发言提纲等，看他们是否执行了支部所布置的学习任务，用口试等方法测验他们学习的效果。然后，根据具体情况，由辅导员给他们进行补课，并给以一定的学习时间。
    培养积极分子，发挥骨干作用
    支部在整个学习中，注意培养学习积极分子。一年来，共培养出二十名学习积极分子。培养方法主要是：把学习上表现积极的吸收到学习核心组里来，经常了解他们的思想情况和学习上的问题，布置工作任务，帮助解决学习上的困难等，使他们在学习中发挥骨干作用。有的干部嫌“经济建设常识读本”太浅，因而不愿学习，或者学习中缺乏独立思考和钻研问题的精神。支部了解了这种情况，便召集了学习积极分子研究如何帮助这些人学好，大家提出了很多方法。经过积极分子的帮助，许多原来学习不好的同志都有了进步。如钱秀清经过积极分子王道明的帮助，克服了松劲思想。积极分子刘克仁帮助张承业解决了学习上的困难。
    检查学习效果，进行表扬和批评
    支部按时检查学习效果，加强了干部学习的自觉性和积极性；同时也能发现学习中存在的问题，及时纠正。支部采取笔试测验和口头提问题，检查笔记和发言提纲，写学习心得和论文，以及典型报告会等形式，来检查干部的学习效果。在每个学习任务完毕后即召开座谈会，每个同志都谈谈自己经过这一阶段学习后的收获，即在理论知识上明白了那些问题，在理解问题的基础上纠正了那些错误思想，现在还存在那些问题，以及今后怎样克服等等。在座谈会的基础上，支部发动大家将自己学习的收获写出心得来，然后支部选出写得比较好的“学习心得”，通过学习报告会加以介绍，来鼓励大家的学习热情。一年来，支部还表扬了五名学习比较好的同志，对于三名学习不够好的，给他们指出了努力的方向，并采取个别帮助的办法，来提高他们的学习积极性。
    一年来，由于支部认真地领导了干部的理论学习，因而使干部思想政策水平有了很大提高；对问题认识也更加全面深刻了。大多数干部在思想上基本上纠正了认为“做税务工作是要小钱的没有出息”、“经济建设与己无关”等错误思想，从而树立了做好税收工作是直接为经济建设服务的观点。随着思想觉悟的提高，干部的工作积极性更加发挥了，工作作风改进了，工作效率提高了，保证了行政计划的实施。
