Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: Many signs indicate that the United States is painstakingly trying to force France to follow it in undermining the Geneva Conference. It is attempting to use the three Indochinese regimes of Bao Dai, etc., to obstruct the Geneva Conference from achieving positive results on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, in order to continue and expand the Indochina War and "take over" this war from France.

According to the "Washington Post's" Paris correspondent, before the start of the Geneva Conference, when Dulles met with Bidault and Eden in Paris, he had "already notified the British and French Foreign Ministers that the United States would not agree to seeking a solution to the Indochina War at the Geneva Conference, because this was unacceptable to the three federal member states of Indochina."

At the same time, according to a report by the "Sunday Times" Washington correspondent, the United States is also prepared to use the Bao Dai and other regimes to overturn any peace agreement and have these regimes fully accept American "protection" in the event that France agrees to restore peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference. The "Sunday Times" Washington correspondent reported: "If France accepts a solution that the United States cannot agree to, Washington's policy may depend on the attitude of the three federal member states. It is believed here that these three countries will refuse to accept any agreement that endangers their future. It is implied that in this case, the United States may consider protecting them."

On the 24th, Dulles met with Bao Dai, who was in Paris, to discuss the situation in Indochina and the Geneva Conference. The next day, Bao Dai issued a statement in Paris openly opposing consultations to restore peace in Indochina. Bao Dai also stated that he and his regime would not be bound by any consultation results.

The American ruling clique advocates war and opposes peace, even at the cost of using extremely vicious methods to achieve this goal. However, the people advocate peace and oppose war. Peace-loving people are powerful. Some of the schemes of the American ruling clique, which are intent on being enemies of the people, should not expect to proceed smoothly.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 27th (TASS): The threat of direct American intervention in the Indochina War has caused deep concern in France. Recently, this threat has become even more concrete due to the vigorous activities of the American diplomatic authorities to continue and expand the Indochina War.

On April 24th, Bao Dai met with Dulles, after which Bao Dai issued a statement declaring his refusal to sign the agreement recently drafted by French and Bao Dai representatives after weeks of negotiations. According to some newspapers, Dulles asked Bao Dai to refuse to sign the agreement on the pretext that the agreement could not guarantee Bao Dai's Vietnam full economic and political independence from France.

According to newspaper reports, French political figures believe that Dulles's meeting with Bao Dai was a means for the United States to exert pressure on the French government. In his communique, Bao Dai opposed any peace negotiations with representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam or with countries "hostile" to the Bao Dai regime. "Le Monde" commented on the 27th: "Bao Dai and Dulles's positions are no different." The newspaper emphasized that the Vietnamese people do not want their country "to become a second Korea due to international warfare" and that they "unanimously demand a cessation of military operations."

    美国企图利用保大等三个政权
    阻挠在印度支那恢复和平
    【新华社二十七日讯】许多迹象显示：美国处心积虑要迫使法国跟着它破坏日内瓦会议，正企图利用保大等印度支那的三个政权来阻挠日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平的问题上得到积极的结果，以便继续和扩大印度支那战争，并从法国手中“接管”这个战争。
    据“华盛顿邮报”驻巴黎记者报道：在日内瓦会议开始之前，杜勒斯在巴黎和皮杜尔与艾登会谈时，“已经通知英法外长，美国将不同意在日内瓦会议上谋求印度支那战争的解决，因为这是印度支那的三个联邦成员国所不能接受的”。
    同时，据英国“星期日泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者发表的消息，美国还准备万一法国在日内瓦会议上同意恢复印度支那和平时，就利用保大等三个政权来推翻和平协议，并使这些政权完全接受美国的“保护”。英国“星期日泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者报道说：“如果法国接受了一个为美国所不能同意的解决办法的话，华盛顿的政策可能决定于三个联邦成员国的态度。此间认为，这三个国家将拒绝接受危害他们前途的任何协议。据暗示，在这种情况下，美国可能考虑保护它们。”
    二十四日，杜勒斯就和正在巴黎的保大会谈了印度支那形势和日内瓦会议问题。第二天，保大就在巴黎发表了一个声明，公开表示反对进行协商恢复印度支那的和平。保大并表示，他和他的政权将不受任何协商结果的约束。
    美国统治集团主张战争、反对和平，甚至不惜用极端恶毒的办法来达到这个目的。但是，人民是主张和平、反对战争的。爱好和平的人民是有力量的。美国统治集团一意与人民为敌的一些计策，不要想一帆风顺的进行。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十七日讯：美国直接干涉印度支那战争的威胁在法国引起了深刻的忧虑。最近，由于美国外交当局极力活动企图继续和扩大印度支那战争，这种威胁就愈加具体了。
    四月二十四日，保大会见杜勒斯，随后保大发表一项声明，声言拒绝签署法国和保大代表最近经过几星期谈判而拟订好的协定。据某些报纸说，杜勒斯要求保大借口这个协定不能保证保大越南从法国获得充分的经济和政治独立，拒绝在协定上签字。
    根据报纸的消息，法国政界人士认为杜勒斯与保大的会谈是美国对法国政府施加压力的手段。保大在他的公报中，反对和越南民主共和国的代表或是和“敌视”保大政权的国家进行任何和平谈判。“世界报”二十七日发表意见说：“保大和杜勒斯的立场没有两样”。报纸着重说，越南人民完全不希望他们的国家“由于国际的战争而变为第二个朝鲜”，他们“一致要求停止军事行动”。
