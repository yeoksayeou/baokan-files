    Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 13th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session on the 11th. The Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, delivered a report on "The Struggle for a Policy of Easing International Tensions, Achieving Peace and Social Progress."

    Longo emphasized that in the three months since the last plenary session of the Central Committee, Italy has changed governments three times. The failure of the current Scelba-Saragat government in the vote on the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance shows that it has the support of only a minority, not only nationwide but also in the Chamber of Deputies. The results of the 1953 elections and the development of the international situation prove that the Christian Democratic Party is incapable of establishing a stable government domestically.

    Longo then said that after the agreements reached at the Berlin Conference, the rulers of Western European countries cannot but increasingly consider the public's desire for peace, while American diplomats are trying every means to demand that Italy and France immediately ratify the "European Defence Community" treaty. The re-establishment of a four-party coalition government of the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Republican Party in Italy under American pressure is clearly for this purpose.

    Longo pointed out that in Italy, France, and West Germany, the forces opposing the establishment of the "European Defence Community" are growing stronger, and the movement demanding a ban on the atomic bomb is also constantly expanding. He further emphasized that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will never threaten Italy, while Italy's membership in the "European Defence Community" will cause Italy to lose its military, political, and economic independence.

    Longo concluded by saying that the points we must emphasize in the movement against the "European Defence Community" are very clear and very common truths, which will surely be supported by millions of citizens. We will encounter devastation and violence, but if we can turn this movement into broad mass action, it will surely be victorious.

    意大利共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    隆哥就缓和国际紧张局势等问题作报告
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议在十一日开幕。意大利共产党副总书记隆哥作了关于“为缓和国际紧张形势、实现和平与社会进步的政策而斗争”的报告。
    隆哥强调指出：在中央委员会上次全体会议以来的三个月中，意大利已更换了三个政府。在表决财政部的预算草案时目前的谢尔巴与萨拉盖特政府的失败，表明不仅在全国范围内，而且在下院内也只有少数人支持它。一九五三年选举的结果和国际形势的发展，证明天主教民主党没有能力在国内建立一个稳定的政府。
    隆哥接着说：在柏林会议达成协议以后，西欧各国的统治者们不能不越来越要考虑公众对和平的渴望，而美国的外交家们却在千方百计地要求意大利和法国立刻批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。意大利在美国人的压力下重新建立一个天主教民主党、社会民主党、自由党与共和党的四党联合政府，显然就是为了这种目的。
    隆哥指出：在意大利、法国与西德各地，反对建立“欧洲防务集团”的力量日益强大，要求禁止原子弹的运动也在不断扩大。他又强调指出：苏联和人民民主国家绝不会威胁意大利，而意大利加入了“欧洲防务集团”，将使意大利丧失军事、政治和经济上的独立。
    隆哥最后说：在反对“欧洲防务集团”运动中我们所必须强调指出的各点，都是非常明白非常普通的道理，它们一定会得到千百万公民的拥护。我们会遇到摧残和暴力，但是假使我们能将这个运动变成群众的广泛的行动，这个运动是一定会胜利的。
