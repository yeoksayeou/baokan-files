    A Profound Socialist Education
    ——Gains from the Propaganda of the General Task of the Transition Period in Anhui Province

    Since November of last year, Party organizations at all levels in Anhui Province have vigorously carried out propaganda and education on the Party's policy and tasks during the transition period. This has resulted in a profound socialist education for the province's Party members, cadres, and masses, generally achieving widespread awareness and deep understanding, with significant gains.

    Over the past few years, cadres and masses in various parts of Anhui Province have received some degree of communist education in the course of various social reform movements and daily political education. Party members and activists have also received relatively systematic education on communism and the Communist Party during Party rectification. Therefore, most people generally understand that socialism is good and that they should take the road to socialism. However, most grassroots cadres and masses are not entirely clear, or not clear at all, about how to achieve socialism and what path to take to transition to socialism. In addition, the ideological boundaries between socialism and capitalism are blurred; especially in rural areas, many cadres and masses still live on the economic basis of the small-peasant economy, and the spontaneous forces of capitalism and the small-peasant economy in rural areas have also developed. A few rural Party members and cadres still hire laborers, buy land, and engage in speculative business. Some workers in factories and mines also have exploitative behaviors such as buying land, lending money, and partnering with private merchants.

    After extensive and in-depth education, the above situation has been initially changed. Now, whether in urban or rural areas, the socialist ideological front has been greatly expanded, and the atmosphere of "taking the road of socialism" and "striving to build socialism" has been greatly strengthened. It has also powerfully promoted the current production movements and economic construction work, and promoted the growth of socialist factors in the national economy.

    All Party members and cadres have universally received a profound socialist education, initially clarifying the Party's policy and tasks during the transition period and the Party's current specific policies for rural work, greatly improving their political and ideological level and socialist consciousness, and greatly increasing their enthusiasm for work. Especially the grassroots cadres in rural areas, when they clarified the direction of rural development, were extremely excited and felt that "the earlier they started, the clearer things became." After discussion and analysis, cadres initially distinguished the boundaries between socialism and capitalism. Some people with exploitative behavior regretted that they had "taken the wrong path and been captured by capitalism," realizing that "if you don't carry a lantern, you will fall into a mud pit." Cadres who had long held "shift change" thoughts also made self-criticism. Many long-term passive Party members and cadres are now working actively. Everyone generally felt that this solved many problems that had not been solved in previous ideological education.

    After the propaganda education, the broad masses of peasants also realized the benefits of taking the socialist road and that the capitalist road is a dead end and must never be taken. Everyone realized that the small-peasant economy is "each family is weak and powerless, unable to move the head or the feet," "south field and north field, ten li away, effort wasted on the road," "one plow and one rake, slow and dragging, plowing for most of the day, not even a palm-sized area." Even with hard work, they still cannot withstand "three winds and four rains." If the small-peasant economy is not transformed, it will inevitably be "the poor are poor, the rich are rich, some helping, some hiring." Everyone also realized that "taking the road of socialism means developing production and increasing income."

    During the study, production comparisons were also carried out, enabling everyone to further realize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. Everyone said: "It is difficult to start a fire with a single piece of firewood, and individual households have many difficulties," "fish rely on water, birds rely on trees, and increased production relies on mutual aid." Therefore, mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives in rural areas have been greatly consolidated and have achieved new development. According to statistics from the Wuhu Special District, 71,174 mutual aid teams and 152 agricultural producers' cooperatives were restored and developed during the propaganda process. "Taking the road of socialism" and "mutual aid and cooperation is glorious" have become universal public opinion in rural areas.

    Due to the universal exposure of the crimes of profiteers' speculation, exploitation, and harm to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the broad masses of peasants have realized that profiteers are "smiling tigers" and "black-hearted," and doing business with profiteers is "raising a tiger to hurt oneself, and people suffer from the tiger's deception." Speculative profiteers have been hit hard in rural areas, and supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives have also had greater development. According to statistics from only five counties including Dingyuan, supply and marketing cooperatives have developed more than 56,000 shares, and newly established rural credit cooperatives and credit groups in only three special districts including Fuyang, Wuhu, and Anqing number 89. At the same time, due to the universal criticism of capitalist ideas, exploitative behaviors such as lending money at high interest rates, speculation and profiteering, buying and selling land, and hiring laborers in rural areas have been opposed by general public opinion. Farmers who engaged in the above behaviors have also changed.

    After the propaganda, the idea of the worker-peasant alliance has also been greatly strengthened. In the past, many grassroots cadres and peasant masses mistakenly believed that the Communist Party "only cares about workers and not about peasants"; some even could not understand why the working class is the leading class. But after propaganda education, many grassroots cadres and peasant masses realized the role of the working class in supporting rural social reform movements and agricultural production over the past few years, initially understood the significance of national socialist industrialization, and saw the great power of the working class. Therefore, they initially corrected their understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and corrected some confused ideas.

    In cities, through propaganda, the broad masses of workers further realized their responsibility and role in building socialism, and their class consciousness was greatly improved. Their production enthusiasm was generally high, and the campaign to increase production and practice economy was rapidly launched. The quantity and quality of products in many factories and mines have been significantly improved, and the production plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy in the fourth quarter of 1953 have been overfulfilled. At the same time, due to the increased awareness of the workers, many problems have been solved smoothly, such as the phenomenon of absenteeism during the Spring Festival has been greatly reduced, and workers have voluntarily proposed to abolish the year-end double salary. Some workers who were eroded by bourgeois ideas also realized that the past ideas and behaviors of lending money, renting out land, and opening shops in partnership with private merchants were wrong, and have changed in practical actions. Handicraft workers have also taken the initiative to organize and take the road of socialism. The unified purchase and sale of grain has also been carried out smoothly.

    Through this stage of work, Party committees at all levels have further realized the importance of propaganda work, the propaganda ability of cadres and Party members has been greatly improved, and propaganda work has also been initially consolidated and developed. Especially through this propaganda activity, the role of the Party's propaganda network has been greatly brought into play, and the propaganda network has been consolidated and developed. According to statistics from only Anqing and Lu'an two special districts, more than 30,000 propagandists have been trained and exercised (accounting for more than 90 percent of the total number of propagandists in the two special districts). Anqing Special District has also newly developed 642 propagandists. The work of reporters has also been mobilized. Not only has the number of people going out to report unprecedentedly increased, but also the reporters' enthusiasm for work is very high. They have made full preparations before going out to report, and the content of the reports is very substantial, so the propaganda effect is very significant. The educational work of rural branches has also made progress, greatly enriching the content of branch education.

    After this period of propaganda, the Party's prestige among the people has also been further enhanced, and the Party's connection with the masses has been closer. The masses deeply feel that "only the Communist Party can guide us to the road of happiness" and unanimously expressed that they will "listen to Chairman Mao and take the road of the Communist Party."

    In the previous stage, Anhui Province's propaganda work was characterized by a blitzkrieg approach, and the development of various regions and various aspects was unbalanced. There are still many shortcomings and problems in the propaganda. For example, individual places confuse the small-peasant economy with capitalism, causing some farmers to feel that they are useless; individual places regard wearing new clothes and riding bicycles as capitalist behavior, causing a few workers and farmers to be unable to distinguish the boundaries between socialism and capitalism. These problems are being addressed in the ongoing propaganda.

### 一次深刻的社会主义教育——安徽省宣传过渡时期总任务的收获

    一次深刻的社会主义教育
    ——安徽省宣传过渡时期总任务的收获
    安徽省各级党组织自去年十一月起，大张旗鼓地进行了关于党在过渡时期的方针和任务的宣传教育，使全省党员、干部、群众普遍受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，基本上达到了家喻户晓，深入人心，收获很大。
    几年来，安徽省各地的干部群众，在历次社会改革运动和日常的政治教育中，都或多或少的受到共产主义教育，党员和积极分子在整党中还受到比较系统的共产主义和共产党的教育，因此，一般的都懂得社会主义好，和要走社会主义的道路。但是怎样才能实现社会主义，过渡到社会主义应该走怎样一条道路，则大多数的基层干部和群众是不完全清楚的，或不清楚的。加上划不清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限；特别是农村中，不少干部和群众依然生活在小农经济的经济基础上，农村中资本主义和小农经济的自发势力也有了发展。有少数农村党员和干部还雇工、买田、做投机生意。在工厂、矿山的工人中也有人买田、放债，和私商合股做生意等剥削行为。
    经过广泛深入的教育后，上述情况已初步改变。现在无论在城市、农村，社会主义的思想阵地大为扩大，“走社会主义的路”、“为建设社会主义而奋斗”的空气也大为浓厚，并且还有力地推动了当前的各项生产运动和经济建设工作，促进了国民经济中社会主义因素的增长。
    在全体党员干部中，普遍地受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，初步明确了党在过渡时期的方针任务和当前党在农村工作的具体政策，大大提高了政治思想水平和社会主义觉悟，工作积极性也大为提高。尤其是农村的基层干部，当明确了农村发展方向以后，兴奋异常，都感到“鸡叫赶路，越赶越明”。干部经过讨论分析，初步划清了社会主义与资本主义的界限，一些有剥削行为的人，痛悔过去
  “走错了路，被资本主义俘掳了”，认识到“不提灯笼走，就要掉下烂泥坑”。长期存在着“换班”思想的干部，也作了自我检查。很多长期消极的党员干部现在积极工作了。大家普遍感到这次解决了历次思想教育中很多未解决的问题。
    广大农民群众经过宣传教育后，也体会到走社会主义道路的好处，资本主义道路是条绝路，万万走不得。大家认识到小农经济是“一家一户，人单力薄，搬头不动，搬脚不动”，“南田北地，一走十里，功夫都误在路上”，“一犁一耙，滴溜搭拉，犁了大半天，没有巴掌大”，纵然努力生产，但仍经不起“三风四雨”；小农经济如不改造，必然是
  “穷的穷，富的富，帮的帮，雇的雇”。大家又认识到
  “走社会主义的路就是要发展生产，增加收入”。
    在学习中，又进行了生产评比，使大家进一步地认识到了互助合作的好处。大家说：“一根劈柴难起火，单门独户困难多”，“鱼靠水，鸟靠树，增加生产靠互助”，因此农村的互助组、农业生产合作社大为巩固，并有了新的发展。据芜湖专区统计，在宣传过程中，即恢复与发展了七万一千一百七十四个互助组和一百五十二个农业生产合作社。“走社会主义的道路”，“互助合作光荣”，已成为农村中普遍的舆论。
    由于普遍揭露了奸商投机、剥削、危害国计民生的罪恶行为，广大农民已认识到奸商是“笑面虎”、“黑炭心”，和奸商做买卖是“养虎伤人，人受虎欺”。投机奸商在农村中已受到打击，而供销合作社和信用合作社也就有了较大的发展。仅据定远等五个县统计，供销合作社即发展了五万六千余股，新办的农村信用合作社与信用小组，仅阜阳、芜湖、安庆等三个专区即有八十九个。同时由于资本主义思想普遍受到批判，农村中放高利贷、投机倒把、买田买地、雇工等剥削行为，已为一般舆论所反对。农民中有上述行为的也纷纷转变。
    经过宣传后，工农联盟思想也大大加强。过去不少基层干部和农民群众错误地认为共产党“只顾工人，不顾农民”；有人甚至想不通为什么工人阶级是领导阶级。但经过宣传教育，许多基层干部和农民群众体会到几年来工人阶级对农村社会改革运动和农业生产支持的作用，初步懂得了国家社会主义工业化的意义，看到工人阶级的伟大力量，因而初步地端正了对工农联盟的认识，纠正了若干糊涂观念。
    在城市中，经过宣传，广大工人进一步认识了自己在建设社会主义中的责任和作用，阶级觉悟大大提高，生产情绪普遍高涨，增产节约运动迅速展开。不少厂、矿的产品数量、质量有了显著提高，超额完成了一九五三年第四季度的生产计划和增产节约计划。同时由于工人的觉悟提高，许多问题都已顺利解决，如春节缺勤现象大大减少，工人自动提出废除年终双薪等。某些受资产阶级思想侵蚀的工人，也认识到过去放债、出租土地、和私商合股开店等思想行为是错误的，并在实际行动中有所转变。手工业者也主动地要求组织起来，走社会主义的道路。粮食统销工作也得以顺利进行。
    经过这一阶段的工作，各级党委也进一步认识到宣传工作的重要，干部、党员的宣传能力也大大提高，宣传业务也得到了初步的整顿和发展。特别是通过这次宣传活动，大大地发挥了党的宣传网的作用，并结合整顿和发展了宣传网。仅据安庆、六安两个专区统计，就培养和锻炼了三万余名宣传员（占两专区宣传员总数的百分之九十以上），安庆专区并新发展了宣传员六百四十二人；把报告员工作也发动起来，不但出去报告的人数空前增多，而且报告员们的工作积极性很高，出去作报告前都作了充分准备，报告内容很充实，因而宣传效果很大。农村支部教育工作也有了进展，大大地丰富了支部教育的内容。
    经过这个时期的宣传，党在人民群众中的威信也更加提高，党和群众的联系已更加密切，群众深切感到“只有共产党才能指引我们走幸福的道路”，
  一致表示要“听毛主席的话，走共产党的路”。
    安徽省前一阶段由于宣传工作带突击性，同时各个地区各个方面发展也不平衡，宣传上还存在着许多缺点和问题，例如个别地方把小农经济和资本主义混为一谈，致使有的农民觉得自己一无是处；个别地方把穿新衣，骑自行车也当作是资本主义行为；致使少数工人，农民分不清社会主义与资本主义的界限。这些问题都正在继续宣传当中注意解决。
