Hunan Farmers Actively Prepare to Expand Double-Cropping Rice Area

Expanding the planting of double-cropping rice is one way to increase the yield per unit area of rice. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has requested that the province increase its area from the original 3.2 million mu to 3.8 million mu this year.

Hunan Province has a warm climate and abundant rainfall, with a year-round frost-free period of up to 230 days. Most areas are suitable for growing double-cropping rice. Liling, Liuyang, and the counties bordering lakes have a tradition of planting double-cropping rice. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have led some state-owned farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and model workers and production experts to trial-plant double-cropping rice in more areas. The vast majority of these trials were successful, resulting in more grain, so the masses have great interest and confidence in planting double-cropping rice.

In areas with the conditions to expand the planting area of double-cropping rice, the masses of farmers are actively exchanging seed grains with each other, preparing to plant more double-cropping rice. Local governments also attach importance to the supply and allocation of double-cropping rice seeds. For example, Wangcheng County collected more than 630,000 jin of early rice "Lei Huo Sticky" and more than 100,000 jin of late rice "Red Rice Dong Sticky" during the autumn harvest last year. Recently, it sent cadres to Liling to exchange 130,000 jin of intercropping late rice seed grain from farmers. Anxiang, Xiangyin, Hengshan, Shuangfeng, Xiangxiang, Taojiang and other counties and the State-owned Datong Lake Farm, etc., have also exchanged more than 400,000 jin of seeds from other places. The masses in Nanxian, Huarong, Yuanjiang, Xinshao, Shaodong, Hengnan, and Dong'an and other places have also exchanged seed grains with each other or transported some seeds from other counties.

Doing a good job in pest control preparations is a powerful guarantee for increasing the production of double-cropping rice. When holding production technology training classes, various localities discussed the cultivation methods of double-cropping rice and studied methods to prevent "rice stink bugs". The students of the Wangcheng County agricultural production training class have learned the use and repair methods of sprayers and have purchased insecticides and machinery. Other localities are also preparing medicines and machinery.

    湖南省农民积极准备扩大双季稻种植面积
    扩大种植双季稻是提高水稻单位面积产量的办法之一。湖南省人民政府要求该省今年在原有的三百二十多万亩的基础上增加到三百八十多万亩。
    湖南省气候温暖，雨量充足，全年无霜期达二百三十多天，大部分地区适宜种植双季稻。醴陵、浏阳和滨湖各县原有种植双季稻的习惯，解放以来，党和人民政府领导部分国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和劳动模范、生产能手在更多的地区试种了双季稻，绝大部分都试种成功，多打了粮食，所以群众种植双季稻的兴趣和信心很大。
    在有条件扩大双季稻种植面积的地区，农民群众正纷纷相互兑换种谷，准备多种双季稻。各地政府也重视双季稻种子的供应和调剂工作。如望城去年秋征时收集了早稻“雷火粘”六十三万多斤，晚稻“红米冬粘”十多万斤，最近又派干部到醴陵向农民兑换间作晚稻种谷十三万斤。安乡、湘阴、衡山、双峰、湘乡、桃江等县和国营大通湖农场等，也向外地调换了种籽四十多万斤。南县、华容、沅江、新邵、邵东、衡南、东安等地群众，也都互相兑换种谷，或向外县调运了一些种子。
    作好治虫准备工作，是双季稻获得增产的有力保证。各地在举办生产技术训练班时，讨论了双季稻的栽培方法，并研究了防止“稻椿象”的办法。望城县农业生产训练班的学员们已学会了喷雾器的使用和修理方法，并购置了杀虫药械。其它各地也正在准备药械。
