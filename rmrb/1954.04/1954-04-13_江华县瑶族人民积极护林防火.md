    Yao People in Jianghua County Actively Protect Forests and Prevent Fires
    Nanmu from the Hunan Forestry Bureau writes: The Yao compatriots who live in Jianghua County, Hunan Province, have planted vast forests, and the "Jianghua wood" produced is famous throughout the country. After liberation, the Yao compatriots actively supplied these precious timbers to meet the needs of the country's economic construction.

      In the winter of 1952, Jianghua County established a forest fire prevention command and extensively promoted forest fire prevention. The enthusiasm of the Yao compatriots for forest protection work was greatly increased, and more than 7,000 people participated in the forest fire prevention organization. Over the past year, the county has opened 3,252 li of firebreaks that are two zhang wide, established 114 observation posts, and prepared more than 10,000 fire-fighting tools. In 1953, the county's losses from mountain fires decreased by 95% compared to 1952. This spring, Jianghua County, in conjunction with the preparations for spring plowing and production, extensively carried out forest fire prevention work and mobilized 6,676 people to repair 2,759 li of firebreaks. At each lookout tower, people take turns watching day and night. Under the slogan of "Everyone protects the forest, everyone prevents fire," the Yao compatriots are protecting the country's forest resources with the attitude of masters of the country.

    江华县瑶族人民积极护林防火
    湖南林业局楠木来信：聚居在湖南省江华县境内的瑶族同胞曾植造了广大的森林，生产的“江华木”著名全国。解放后，瑶族同胞积极把这些珍贵的木材供应祖国经济建设的需要。
      一九五二年冬，江华县成立了护林防火指挥部，并广泛地进行了护林防火的宣传，瑶族同胞护林工作的积极性大大提高了，有七千多人参加了护林防火的组织。一年来全县开辟了二丈宽、三千二百五十二里长的防火线，建立了一百一十四座瞭望台，准备了一万多件打火工具。一九五三年该县所受山火损失比一九五二年减少了百分之九十五。今春，江华县又结合春耕生产的准备工作，广泛开展了护林防火工作，发动了六千六百七十六人修好了两千七百五十九里的防火线。每个瞭望台上，白天、晚上都有人轮流守望。在“人人护林，个个防火”的口号下，瑶族同胞们都以国家主人翁的态度保护着国家的森林资源。
