Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 21st: TASS Geneva, April 21st: A consultation conference on trade between Eastern and Western European countries opened in Geneva on April 20th.

    Experts from twenty-six European countries (the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, the United Kingdom, France, other countries and the United States) are participating in this conference. This is the second conference on trade between Eastern and Western Europe organized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The first such conference was held in Geneva in April 1953, based on a statement by Gunnar Myrdal, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and with the unanimous agreement of the Commission's member states. That conference had positive results, facilitating the conclusion of many new trade agreements between Eastern and Western European countries, and extending the terms of existing trade agreements.

    At the Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, representatives of European countries expressed great interest in this conference to promote trade relations between Eastern and Western Europe. According to a proposal by the Commission's Secretariat, this conference will last approximately two weeks. It will examine the development of trade between Eastern and Western European countries from April 1953 to the present. Experts will exchange views on the types and quantities of goods that these countries can buy and sell to each other in 1954 and 1955, as well as on the "composition of trade" between Eastern and Western European countries.

    During this conference, experts from various countries will also hold meetings.

    东西欧国家贸易谘询会议在日内瓦开幕
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社日内瓦二十一日讯：关于东西欧国家之间贸易的谘询会议四月二十日在日内瓦开幕。
    参加这个会议的有二十六个欧洲国家（苏联、各人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国、西德、英国、法国及其他国家和美国）的专家。这是联合国欧洲经济委员会组织的关于东西欧之间贸易的第二次会议。第一次这样的会议是根据联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔的声明和该委员会会员国的一致意见，于一九五三年四月在日内瓦举行的。那次会议收到了积极的结果，促进了东西欧国家间许多新贸易协定的缔结，并延长了原有的贸易协定的期限。
    在联合国欧洲经济委员会第九次会议上，欧洲各国的代表对这个促进东西欧贸易关系的会议表示了极大的兴趣。根据该委员会秘书处的提议，这个会议大约将举行两星期。它将检查从一九五三年四月到现在的东西欧国家之间的贸易发展情况。专家们将就这些国家在一九五四年到一九五五年能够互相买卖的货物的种类和数量以及东西欧国家之间的“贸易的构成”等问题交换意见。
    在这个会议期间，各国专家也将举行会议。
