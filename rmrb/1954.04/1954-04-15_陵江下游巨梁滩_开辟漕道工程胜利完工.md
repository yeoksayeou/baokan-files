    Giant Liangtan on the Lower Reaches of the Jialing River
    Canal Construction Project Successfully Completed
    The canal construction project at Giant Liangtan on the lower reaches of the Jialing River, which began construction in December of last year, was successfully completed in March of this year. Giant Liangtan is located twenty-one kilometers from Hechuan. There, a stone ridge extends into the water, and the banks of the stone ridge are jagged rocks. The water flow is rapid, and there are hidden reefs everywhere, making it very easy for boats to have accidents. According to statistics, the loss of grain due to accidents each year is more than one million jin. For a long time, the loss of life and property due to the danger of Giant Liangtan has been incalculable.
    The Third Branch of the Sichuan Provincial Inland Water Navigation Administration accepted the people's demands and sent people to investigate, held several meetings with local boatmen and boat people to study, and formulated a renovation plan for Giant Liangtan. On December 25th of last year, a construction team was formally established and construction began. During the construction, the workers created the "ox glue bamboo tube water cannon method" and improved the pressure引法 (pressure leading method). They used black gunpowder ox glue fuse to replace yellow explosives and detonators, which not only increased the explosive power but also saved manpower and material resources, enabling the entire project to be completed on schedule. A total of 6,000 cubic meters of hard rock were blasted, and a new canal 100 meters long and 50 meters wide was excavated. From then on, the dangerous face of Giant Liangtan has been fundamentally changed, ensuring the safety and smooth flow of navigation.

    嘉陵江下游巨梁滩
    开辟漕道工程胜利完工
    嘉陵江下游巨梁滩开辟漕道工程，自去年十二月开始施工，到今年三月已胜利完工。巨梁滩距合川有二十一公里，那里有条石梁伸入水中，石梁两岸又是齿形岩石，水流急湍，暗礁错杂，行船最易失事。据统计每年因失事而损失的粮食在百万斤以上。长期以来，因巨梁滩险而造成人民生命财产的损失，真是难以数计。
    四川省内河航运管理局第三分局接受了人民的要求，曾派人查勘，与当地船工船民几度开会研究，作出巨梁滩整治计划，于去年十二月二十五日正式成立施工队开始施工。施工中职工们创造了
  “牛胶竹筒水炮法”，改进了压引法，用黑火药牛胶引线代替黄炸药和雷管，不但提高了爆炸威力，同时节约了人力物力，使全部工程如期完成任务。总计炸除六千公方坚石，开凿出长一百公尺、宽五十公尺的新漕道。从此根本上改变了巨梁滩险恶的面貌，保障了航运安全与畅通。
