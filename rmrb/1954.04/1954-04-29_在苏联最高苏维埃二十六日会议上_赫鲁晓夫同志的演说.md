    At the Twenty-Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union
    Speech by Comrade Khrushchev
    Comrade Delegates! The Soviet people have achieved tremendous successes in economic and cultural construction and in improving the welfare of the working people. These achievements are due to the fact that the Communist Party firmly and confidently guides the Soviet state along the path indicated by our brilliant leader and teacher, the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, V.I. Lenin (stormy and prolonged applause). The Party and its Central Committee, carrying out Lenin's behests, under the leadership of the great successor to Lenin's cause, J.V. Stalin, tirelessly consolidated the Soviet state and built it into a powerful socialist country—an indestructible fortress of world peace. We have achieved these successes because the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union warmly support the policies of the Communist Party, because our heroic working class, glorious collective farmers, and people's Soviet intellectuals spare no effort in striving to realize the great plans for communist construction (prolonged applause).
    In the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held on March 14, our people once again demonstrated that they are indivisibly united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The fact that the whole nation unanimously voted for the candidates of the Party and the non-Party bloc is one of the manifestations of the nationwide support for our Party’s policies, and it indicates the Soviet people’s deep conviction that the representatives of the supreme organ of state power—the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—will not fail to live up to the people’s lofty trust and will selflessly struggle for the prosperity of the socialist motherland (applause).
    Our most important task at present is to rapidly develop agriculture and vigorously increase the production of consumer goods while not relaxing the development of heavy industry—the foundation of the socialist economy—so as to supply the residents with sufficient industrial products and food within the next two to three years, and to greatly improve the living standards of the working people.
    The draft state budget of the Soviet Union for 1954 stipulates huge amounts of funds to be allocated for the further development of all sectors of the national economy. The appropriations for realizing the plans formulated by the Party and the government to vigorously improve the welfare of the Soviet people have been greatly increased. A total of 74.4 billion rubles is planned to be allocated for the development of agriculture alone, an increase of 42.4 percent over 1953. 31 billion rubles will be allocated for further expanding the production of consumer goods, an increase of 45.7 percent over last year. 141.3 billion rubles will be used for social and cultural facilities, an increase of approximately 10 percent over last year.
    We have all the necessary material and technical conditions to solve the task of further greatly improving our national economy. Soviet organs, Party organizations, and economic organs should focus their attention on properly utilizing these conditions and turning the existing possibilities into reality. We are fighting for the great cause of the people—building communism. To achieve this goal, we should work extremely hard. It is necessary to talk about this because not everyone has deeply realized how important and complex the work we should complete is. Our task is to mobilize all the internal potential in industry, transportation and agriculture.
    Lenin repeatedly emphasized that raising labor productivity is of paramount importance for the victorious construction of a communist society. He said that labor productivity is the most important and principal condition for the victory of a new social system. Labor productivity in our country has already been greatly improved: in 1953, labor productivity in industry increased by 71 percent compared with 1940. However, there are still serious shortcomings in this regard. Some industrial sectors and many enterprises have not paid enough attention to the mechanization of production, especially the mechanization of auxiliary work. Due to the irresponsibility of individual economic leaders, the use of first-class machines is often very poor. The following example can illustrate this point: in 1953, the number of machines for transporting wood in the timber and paper industry's timber transport depots increased by two times compared with 1940, the number of tractors increased by five times, and the number of locomotives increased by six times, but the labor productivity of timber transport workers has been very low for many years, and has not yet reached the pre-war level. This is the result of poor labor organization and very unsatisfactory machine utilization. The plan for raising labor productivity in such an important sector of the national economy as the coal mining industry has also been completed very poorly, although this industrial sector is equipped with advanced machines and has excellent skilled workers and expert cadres. Now is the time to understand that if we cannot continuously and vigorously raise labor productivity, it will be impossible to victoriously solve the task of further developing heavy industry and rapidly developing agriculture, light industry and the food industry. This is a major link, and we should seize this link to achieve a stronger upsurge in all sectors of the national economy. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, about three-quarters of the increase in industrial products will rely on raising labor productivity.
    The great potential for further developing industry is to more fully utilize production capacity. There are many enterprises with the same technical equipment, cadres and production site conditions, but their production indicators are very different. As an example: the equipment of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory and the Kharkov Tractor Factory are basically the same. In December 1949, they simultaneously turned to producing diesel tractors. However, the technical and economic indicators of these two factories are different. Compared with the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, the Kharkov Tractor Factory used 2.4 percent less labor to produce each tractor last year, the production volume per worker was about 10 percent higher, the loss of defective products was 41 percent lower, and the cost of tractors was 10 percent lower. This is because the Kharkov Tractor Factory paid more attention to applying advanced technical operations and high-efficiency labor methods in production. If the Machine Building Industry Department can seriously organize the work of promoting advanced experience, then the Stalingrad Tractor Factory can greatly improve its technical and economic indicators like the Kharkov Tractor Factory.
    While guiding the staff of the entire industrial sector to further improve labor productivity, we must strive to emphasize the primary and urgent tasks of improving product quality and reducing costs. It is no longer permissible for many enterprises to fail to complete the tasks of the state plan and quality indicators for a long time. The glorious cause of every enterprise staff member is to produce high-quality products and forever eradicate the shameful phenomenon of producing low-quality goods and generating a large number of defective products.
    Comrades, at the two plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee in September and February-March, the serious shortcomings of some agricultural sectors have been exposed, and methods for overcoming these shortcomings have been stipulated. The fact that the Party Central Committee resolutely exposed the phenomenon of no one being responsible in individual sectors of agricultural production demonstrates the strength of our Party and the Soviet people, and demonstrates the power of the socialist system. The Soviet people are confident that the existing shortcomings will be overcome in the shortest period.
    Our working people are vigorously striving to implement measures to improve agriculture. The call issued by the Party and the government to the Soviet people to participate in the reclamation of virgin and cultivated land has been widely responded to. In two months, more than 500,000 Soviet patriots requested to be sent to work on the reclamation of new land. More than 80,000 agronomists, engineers, machine operators and other staff members have undertaken this glorious and significant cause. Isn't this another vivid proof of the high degree of spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people and their political activeness and determination to do everything possible to build communism? This also shows that the interests of our Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people are consistent, and the unbreakable alliance of the working class and the collective farmers is consolidated.
    Our socialist industry meets the necessary requirements of agriculture in terms of technical equipment. In a relatively short period, 15,000 powerful diesel tractors, tens of thousands of plows, seeders and other agricultural machines have been transported to reclaim new land. We are fully confident that we will victoriously reclaim 13 million hectares of virgin and cultivated land in two years. While striving to increase the yield per unit area of all crops, we must also make more rational use of all the land of collective farms and state farms, and further expand the sown area by reclaiming new land, of which we have quite a lot.
    The spring field work is now underway across the country. Doing a good job in this year's spring sowing should be a major step in increasing grain production and increasing the yield per unit area of all crops. All our local Soviet organs, Party organizations and agricultural organs should guide the labor enthusiasm of agricultural workers and ensure the organized progress of spring sowing and some agricultural work after spring sowing. We have all the conditions to vigorously develop agriculture, but we must be good at utilizing these conditions. Primary attention should be focused on strengthening the leadership of collective farms, state farms and machine tractor stations, and strengthening the leadership of the region.
    What else is lacking in many of our leading cadres? I think they are not doing enough in specific leadership work, timely pointing out shortcomings, and correcting shortcomings. There are many comrades who are only enthusiastic about listing those shortcomings discovered by the Party Central Committee, but in their own collective farm or region, in the state or republic, they cannot point out specific shortcomings, cannot try to eliminate these shortcomings, and the organization work is weak. Every staff member of machine tractor stations and state farms, every collective farm member, and all agricultural experts should strive to eliminate specific shortcomings and improve the work of every collective farm, state farm, and machine tractor station.
    Grain production is the foundation of the entire agricultural production. Therefore, the Party and the government are taking all measures to further increase grain production, so as to fully meet the growing needs of the residents for food, ensure grain feed for animal husbandry, and enrich the national reserves. This task can be solved. There is no doubt that this task will be solved by increasing the yield per unit area and reclaiming virgin and cultivated land.
    In order for our industry to produce enough textiles and clothing for the residents, it is necessary to greatly expand the sown area of industrial raw material crops that provide raw materials for industry, especially cotton, fiber flax, hemp, etc., and increase their total harvest. To have more sugar, it is necessary to expand the sown area of sugar beets and increase their yield per unit area. To meet the need for fruits and berries, it is necessary to establish orchards, berry gardens, and vineyards. But it must be known that it takes at least eight or nine years to cultivate a good fruit-bearing orchard. Every state, first of all, Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, Donbass, Kuzbass and other industrial center areas, as well as the Far East regions, must solve the task of supplying potatoes and vegetables to the working people this year.
    Developing animal husbandry is of the most important significance for ensuring the supply of high-quality food for residents and the supply of raw materials for industry. However, in many states, border areas, and republics, the use of the great potential for developing animal husbandry is very poor. The number of livestock per 100 hectares of agricultural land is still very small, and the productivity of livestock products is still very low. The collective farms and state farms in every region should make unremitting efforts to obtain as much grain, milk, meat, wool, leather, vegetables, potatoes and other products per 100 hectares of agricultural land as the advanced collective farms and state farms in the same region.
    The country is widely launching a competition to participate in the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition that will open this year. This exhibition will play an important role in disseminating the experience of advanced collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms and agricultural production innovators and scientific achievements; this exhibition will be a powerful lever in the struggle to improve all sectors of our agriculture.
    Comrades, in order to advance victoriously, it is necessary to constantly and continuously improve the work of state organs. The Soviet state organs, as a whole, have undoubtedly achieved great successes in solving the tasks of economic and cultural construction. However, in addition to the achievements, we cannot fail to see serious shortcomings. At present, we have a bad habit: the focus of work of many organs is not how to organize work, but to draft a large number of various instructions, directives and orders, various reference materials and forms, and hold many various meetings that make people disengaged from practical work. Since the CPC Central Committee made the decision "On the Serious Shortcomings in the Work of Party and State Organs," some specific measures have been taken to eradicate bureaucracy, bureaucratic leadership methods, reduce many redundant documents and forms, and constantly strengthen flexible leadership of grass-roots work. But it should be pointed out that some leading personnel have not drawn due conclusions based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee, so they have not changed their work style and work methods to this day.
    The September and February-March plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee exposed the serious shortcomings in the work of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms and their local institutions. However, the reorganization of the work of these ministries is very slow, and their institutions are still huge. For example, there are 422 administrations, departments, and sections in the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, which is enough to explain the problem. The result of the reorganization is that one in every two staff members of the ministry is a chief (the whole room burst into laughter). Lessons must be learned from the shortcomings arising from the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture, and these shortcomings cannot be allowed to appear in other ministries.
    As everyone knows, many decisions on downsizing certain ministries have recently been passed. Experience shows that if the government's ministries are very large, if they lead many national economic sectors and a large number of enterprises of different types, then it is difficult for them to effectively lead these sectors and enterprises. Therefore, everyone agrees that it is reasonable to downsize these ministries. The relevant orders of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are being submitted to the Supreme Soviet for consideration. Some ministers believe that their task is to organize many huge and bloated institutions. Then they should be corrected here. When downsizing the ministries, attention should be paid to ensuring that the staff of the institutions under the new ministries must not exceed the number of original staff of the original ministries before the division. I think this proposal will not be particularly approved by individual ministers (the room showed a lively atmosphere). But I am convinced that this proposal is aimed at improving the work of our state organs and will inevitably be supported by the representatives (applause).
    The reorganization of the ministries should not be mechanical, but should proceed from the task of improving the efficiency of the work of state organs and further improving the leadership of enterprises. For these purposes, it is necessary to greatly reduce the flow of documents and excessive forms; relentlessly eradicate bureaucratic and paperwork styles of leadership. Only in this way can the work of state organs be improved, and the work of organizing production can be done better with fewer people. If we take the path of least resistance and set up huge institutions in the new ministries, then the reorganization will not bring any benefits. The task facing the ministries (including the reorganized ministries) is to strive to improve the specific leadership of each enterprise and improve the sense of responsibility of each staff member from top to bottom for completing the national economic plan. According to reports from staff members of local institutions, to date, the institutions of the ministries, republics and states continue to issue countless instructions, directives and orders to them. For example, the Lysenko Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant received 2,580 various instructions from the Ministry of Machine Building Industry last year, and 640 in the first two and a half months of this year. The management office of the factory issued a total of 10,250 various documents in the past year, and 3,000 in the first two and a half months of this year. The Kuibyshev State Executive Committee (chaired by Petrushin) issued about 12,000 instructions, directives and telegrams to various places last year (the whole room burst into laughter). This cannot but remind people of Saltykov-Shchedrin's incisive words in the fairy tale about a diligent chief. This great satirist wrote: "Woe to the place where the chief issues resolutions indiscriminately." (laughter in the hall). You see, these words have not lost their meaning today.
    In the cause of the victorious development of the national economy, persistently practicing economy plays a significant role. In the national budget, billions of dollars are allocated for economic and cultural construction. These funds must be used with the attitude of masters, and every ruble and every kopeck of the people must be used carefully.
    Comrades, it must be admitted that we have not eradicated the indifferent attitude towards the use of state funds. Even within the system of the Soviet Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for strictly supervising the implementation of financial discipline and economy, there are phenomena of bloated staffing and very chaotic organization of financial work. In fact, some regions of the Karelia-Finland Republic, even after the tax authorities were reduced, still have so many tax units that their salaries even exceed the total amount of taxes paid in those regions. Doesn't this illustrate the astonishing chaos? (the hall burst into laughter) For example, in the Kalevala region, the total annual salary of the tax unit is 56,000 rubles, but the tax unit in the region received only 55,000 rubles in taxes (laughter). In the Sooyarvsky region, the total salary of the tax unit exceeds 26,000 rubles (laughter). We spend a lot of money on the redundant staffing of various competent authorities and institutions. Isn't it clear that this bad phenomenon must be resolutely eliminated?
    Our task is to intensify the struggle against the bureaucratic vices in individual organs, concentrate major forces to flexibly organize the work of enterprises, machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, launch criticism and self-criticism, and resolutely eliminate shortcomings. Party organizations, Soviet organs, economic organizations, and trade union organizations at all levels should pay more attention to meeting the daily needs of residents, study housing construction and welfare issues more deeply, and improve trade and public catering in each residential area.
    Comrades, in the urban and rural areas of our vast motherland, a nationwide movement is being launched to further develop socialist industry, increase the production of consumer goods, and vigorously develop agriculture. The staff and workers of the advanced enterprises in Moscow and Moscow State have launched a competition to strive for high labor productivity, increase production on existing production sites, improve product quality, and reduce costs. Their patriotic initiative is being supported in all aspects and is being widely promoted. The competition in enterprises in Leningrad, Kiev and other industrial centers in the country is expanding. Many new labor methods are constantly emerging in the competition. However, the initiatives and experiences of advanced people are not supported everywhere. Unfortunately, there are still some economic leaders who do not carefully study and actively promote new and advanced things, but reject many valuable suggestions. There are also some workers who are still working with outdated methods. They only shout out such "policies": "Hurry up, brother!" "Let's urge it," "Let's check it," "We must launch it," and many other such irresponsible and empty words that will not produce any results. Of course, such leadership is ineffective.
    In any work, a conservative and formalistic style is intolerable and harmful, and in the competition, this style is particularly intolerable. However, there is also a formal and bureaucratic style in leading the competition. Some enterprises have stipulated many different ways of reporting the competition and formulated many imaginary conventions, which have stifled the creativity and initiative of the masses. In order to summarize the competition, the Kharkov Bicycle Factory formulated dozens of various report forms. According to only one of the report forms on the promotion of advanced labor methods, each workshop must fill out a monthly report form including more than 1,000 questions (the whole room burst into laughter). In this way, dozens of staff members cannot do useful things, but are busy compiling and synthesizing these forms! This is the most harmful bureaucratic style. Bureaucratic attitudes must be resolutely eradicated, and attitudes of organizing competitions in a uniform and rigid manner must be resolutely opposed.
    Socialist competition is a lively and creative cause of tens of thousands of working people. It has become a time-tested method of communist construction. The communist seedlings that Lenin saw in the obligatory Saturday have today grown into a strong socialist competition—the great movement of working people striving to complete the development plan of each sector of the national economy as quickly as possible.
    Comrades, engaged in peaceful creative labor, we have always implemented a peaceful foreign policy, and constantly consolidated and expanded the business contacts between the Soviet Union and all countries willing to conduct business contacts on the basis of mutual benefit. The entire history of the development of the Soviet state is a clear proof of the Soviet Union's love of peace, and is a clear proof of the implementation of the principles of mutual relations between the Soviet Union and other countries formulated by Lenin. Our task is to continue to implement a peaceful policy that is understood and close to the people of all countries, consolidate business contacts with foreign countries, and strive to develop trade with them on the basis of mutual benefit.
    As early as the early days after the establishment of the Soviet regime, Lenin said: "There is a force that is more powerful than the wishes, will and decisions of any hostile country or class, and this force is the overall global economic relationship, which forces them to deal with us in this regard." Facts have confirmed the correctness of Vladimir Ilyich's words. Despite the various conspiracies and tricks used by various enemies, the Soviet Union's foreign trade has been expanding year by year. We are now trading with fifty-one countries. In 1953, the total volume of trade between the Soviet Union and foreign companies increased by 11 percent compared with 1952, and almost tripled compared with the pre-war level. More and more people in bourgeois countries recognize the urgent need to develop and strengthen trade ties with our country and the people's democratic countries. For example, many trade delegations, especially delegations of business people from Britain, Argentina and some other countries, have visited the Soviet Union in recent months and signed some important trade agreements.
    The proposal to expand and strengthen business contacts between countries, as well as the Soviet government's measures to ease international tensions, have been warmly supported and endorsed by countries around the world. But what is supported by millions of people has aroused the anger and vicious attacks of some dignitaries in the United States and other countries. What I am referring to is first and foremost Mr. Dulles, the US Secretary of State. While the Soviet Union is making every effort to ease the situation of unjustified mutual distrust, Mr. Dulles is raging as if he is suffering from some kind of madness. In many of his speeches, he has been promoting the policy of strength; inciting war hysteria and hatred and contempt for the people; and threatening many countries, especially the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries. All sane people in the world are eager to ease international tensions, and condemn the discriminatory policy implemented by the US ruling clique against the great People's Republic of China with a population of more than 500 million. This shortsighted policy is bound to fail (prolonged applause).
    Since the founding of the Soviet state, we have heard various threats against the Soviet people more than once, and we know the price of this trick. We are not afraid of threats, and threats cannot scare us. We remember how Hitler and his accomplices shouted about the weakness of the Soviet Union before invading our country, trying to profit at the expense of the Soviet Union, and attracting other imperialist plunderers to military adventures. Everyone knows what the outcome was. There is no doubt that if anyone arrogantly imitates Hitler, they will inevitably suffer the same fate (stormy and prolonged applause). Never forget the lessons of history. These lessons are: the First World War enabled the socialist revolution to win victory in our country and established the first state of workers and peasants in the world. As a result of the Second World War, many countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist system, and the people of these countries bravely embarked on the road of socialist development and established people's democratic systems in their own countries. It would be foolish to think that the people who have forever escaped the shackles of capitalist slavery would voluntarily put on these shackles again just to please Mr. Dulles and his followers (applause).
    If the imperialists launch a new war, then this war will inevitably end with the collapse of the entire capitalist system (stormy applause).
    Our people do not want war, because they know that war will bring bloodshed, great sacrifices and destruction. The people of all countries in the world do not want war either, and the powerful movement to defend peace is a clear proof of this.
    It would be much better for the cause of peace if Dulles and other figures in capitalist countries could make their remarks more calmly. We are very clear that Dulles and his ilk do not like the Soviet state, let alone the Communist Party. We are not prepared to say that we have any sympathy for capitalism, because the capitalist system ruthlessly exploits the working class, enslaves the people of all countries, and makes millions of working people live an unbearable life. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, but our people, like millions of people all over the world, have always expressed sympathy for the people who are fighting against the colonialists and imperialist aggressors, and hope that the oppressed people will achieve a complete victory in their struggle for liberation (prolonged applause).
    At the same time, we have always believed that the peaceful coexistence of socialism and capitalism is possible. Since there are two systems, their business contacts must be strengthened, rather than provoking mutual hostility and hatred. The people of all countries should decide for themselves their attitude towards the current system in their own countries. The Soviet state will continue to adhere to a peaceful foreign policy, strive to ease international tensions, work to develop business contacts between countries, and consolidate world peace (prolonged applause).
    Why do the perpetrators of aggressive policies brandish their teeth and claws and implement the notorious policy of strength? Frankly speaking, even the planners of this policy themselves understand that it is too abrupt and reckless to treat great powers such as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China with this policy. Now everyone can see that the strength of the growing socialist democratic camp, which accounts for more than one-third of the world's population, is constantly strengthening and consolidating. Everyone knows that a person often loses his mind when he is in a rage. Is it appropriate for a politician who announces the country's foreign policy to be full of hatred and malice towards the people of other countries? Blind hatred is the root of right and wrong. At the instigation of politicians such as Mr. Dulles, the newspapers and radio stations of the American bourgeoisie are making the most absurd and clumsy distortions of some of the measures taken by the Soviet government to ease international tensions. The Soviet government's proposal to improve business contacts with capitalist countries has been described by some bourgeois newspapers as a "Soviet economic bomb" and a "communist conspiracy" aimed at conquering the world. The imperialists are very clear that the Soviet Union is implementing a peaceful policy and does not intend to attack anyone. Why are they clamoring about the non-existent Soviet threat? They are clamoring in this way for propaganda. They fabricate some imaginary danger from the Soviet Union to scare the people, so that it is easier to collect taxes and ensure that imperialist monopoly capital obtains high profits. The imperialists are inciting hysteria in order to justify the mad arms race, and they hope to alleviate the impact of the increasingly imminent economic crisis through the arms race. The American imperialists also want to scare the people of Western European countries and force the governments of these countries to pay more money for armaments. The economies of Western European countries are already extremely tight, and American capitalists sell their munitions to them in the name of aid to extract huge profits and enslave these countries.
    The imperialists are afraid of peaceful competition with the Soviet state, because the capitalist system is clearly unable to withstand this competition. The American bourgeois press is increasingly reflecting a fear that the rapid development of the Soviet Union and the improvement of the people's material welfare will attract the working people of capitalist countries. In this regard, an article in the "New York Herald Tribune" on April 11 is noteworthy, and this article is quite well written. This article wrote: "While we are still gleefully comforting ourselves with the bankrupt myth of 'backward Russians,' the huge Soviet state is constantly strengthening its economic strength at a speed much faster than Western Europe. The center of gravity has shifted to consumer goods. Believe it or not, but this is indeed the most dangerous event in the second half of the twentieth century (the whole room burst into laughter). The sad and undeniable fact (note that sad is for the imperialists) is that the Soviet Union's industry and technology have made great progress after the war, which is great by Russian standards, and even huge by our standards." This is what the imperialist lords are afraid of.
    The working people of the world have personally seen that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, where the power belongs to the people, are victoriously implementing plans for peaceful construction, and everything is to ensure the continuous improvement of the people's welfare. We will unswervingly continue to work to strengthen the Soviet state, improve the living standards of our people, and develop all sectors of the national economy. We will tirelessly strengthen the defense capabilities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, so that when the mad imperialist aggressors dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and infringe on our motherland, they will be given a devastating counterattack, and they will taste again the taste that the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces gave to the Hitler aggressors during the Second World War (stormy and prolonged applause). The Soviet people are marching confidently along the broad road to communism. No matter how angry the enemies are, they cannot stop us from advancing victoriously, just as they cannot stop the sun from rising (prolonged applause). We live in an era in which the cause of communist construction has become the cause of millions of people, and the victory of this cause is beyond doubt (prolonged applause). The immortal and vibrant doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin illuminate the road to communism (prolonged applause). The Soviet Communist Party, created and nurtured by our immortal father and mentor Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and tempered in the struggle for the happiness of the working people, leads the Soviet people to communism (stormy and prolonged applause, which then turned into cheers. Everyone stood up). (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 27th by TASS)

    在苏联最高苏维埃二十六日会议上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的演说
    代表同志们！苏联人民在经济建设、文化建设和增进劳动人民福利方面获得了巨大的成就。这些成就的获得，是由于共产党坚定而满怀信心地引导着苏维埃国家沿着我们天才的领袖和导师、共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者乌·伊·列宁所指示的道路迈进（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）。党及其中央委员会执行着列宁的遗训，在列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林的领导下，不倦地巩固了苏维埃国家，把它建设成一个强大的社会主义国家——不可摧毁的世界和平堡垒。我们之所以获得这些成就，是因为苏联各族人民热烈拥护和支持共产党的政策，因为我们英雄的工人阶级、光荣的集体农民和人民的苏维埃知识分子不遗余力地为实现伟大的共产主义建设计划而奋斗（经久不息的掌声）。
    我国人民在三月十四日举行的苏联最高苏维埃的选举中又一次显示了：他们不可分地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围。一致投票选举党和非党联盟的候选人这一事实，是全国人民拥护和支持我们党的政策的表现之一，它表示苏联人民深信：国家最高政权机构——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃——的代表不会辜负人民的崇高信任，并将忘我地为社会主义祖国的繁荣而奋斗（掌声）。
    我们当前最重要的任务是，在不放松发展重工业——社会主义经济的基础的基础——的同时，急速提高农业，大力增产消费品，要在最近两三年内供给居民以足够的工业品和食品，大大提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    苏联一九五四年国家预算草案规定拨出巨款来进一步发展国民经济各部门。用来实现党和政府所制订的大力增进苏联人民福利的计划的拨款大大增加了。仅在发展农业方面就准备拨出七百四十四亿卢布，即比一九五三年增加百分之四十二点四。将拨出三百一十亿卢布来进一步扩大消费品的生产，即比去年增加百分之四十五点七。用于社会和文化设施的将有一千四百一十三亿卢布，约比去年增加百分之十。
    我们有着一切必需的物质和技术条件来解决进一步大大提高我国国民经济的任务。苏维埃机关、党组织和经济机关应当集中注意来妥善地利用这些条件，把现有的可能变为现实。我们在为伟大的人民事业——建成共产主义而奋斗。要达到这个目的，我们应当极其紧张地工作。所以必须谈到这一点，是因为不是所有的人都已深刻地意识到：我们应当完成的工作是如何的重要和复杂。我们的任务是：动员工业、运输业和农业中的一切内部潜力。
    列宁曾不止一次地着重指出，提高劳动生产率对胜利地建设共产主义社会具有头等重要的意义。他说过，劳动生产率是新社会制度取得胜利的最重要、最主要的条件。我国的劳动生产率已经大大地提高了：一九五三年工业中的劳动生产率比一九四零年提高了百分之七十一。但是，在这一方面仍然存在着严重的缺点。有些工业部门和许多企业对生产的机械化，特别是辅助工作的机械化还没有予以足够的注意。由于个别经济领导人员的不负责任，头等机器的使用往往非常不好。下面这个例子就能说明这一点：一九五三年木材和造纸工业部各木材采运处的运木材的机器比一九四零年增加了两倍，拖拉机增加了五倍，机车增加了六倍，但是，木材采运工人的劳动生产率许多年来却一直很低，直到现在还没有达到战前的水平。这是由于劳动组织得不好，机器的利用非常不能令人满意的结果。像采煤工业这样重要的国民经济部门，提高劳动生产率的计划完成的情况也非常不好，虽然这个工业部门装备有先进的机器，拥有卓越的熟练工人和专家干部。现在是应该明白的时候了：如果不能不断地大力提高劳动生产率，就不可能胜利地解决进一步发展重工业、急速提高农业、轻工业和食品工业的任务。这是一个主要环节，我们应当抓住这个环节才能取得国民经济各部门的更强大的高涨。在第五个五年计划中，要靠提高劳动生产率来使工业产品增加四分之三左右。
    进一步发展工业的巨大潜力是更充分地利用生产能力。有不少企业，它们的技术装备、干部和生产场地的条件都一样，但是它们的生产指标就差得很远。举一个例子：斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂和哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂的设备基本上都是一样的。在一九四九年十二月，它们同时转向生产柴油拖拉机。但是这两家工厂的技术经济指标却不同。和斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂比较，哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂去年生产每台拖拉机所需的劳动量要少百分之二点四，每个工人的生产量约多百分之十，废品损失少百分之四十一，拖拉机成本低百分之十。这是因为哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂更加注意在生产中运用先进技术操作和高效率的劳动方法。如果机器制造工业部能认真组织推广先进经验的工作，那么就可以使斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂和哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂一样大大提高技术经济指标。
    一方面引导整个工业部门工作人员致力于进一步提高劳动生产率，一方面必须竭力强调提高产品质量和降低成本这一首要和迫切的任务。决不能再容忍许多企业长期不完成国家计划和质量指标的任务。每一企业工作人员的光荣事业就是生产质量高的产品，永远根绝生产质量低的货品和产生大量废品这样可耻的现象。
    同志们，在党中央委员会九月和二—三月的两次全体会议上已把若干农业部门的严重缺点揭露出来，并规定了克服这些缺点的办法。党中央委员会坚决揭露农业生产个别部门的无人负责现象，这一事实说明了我们党和苏联人民的力量，说明了社会主义制度的威力。苏联人民确信：现存的缺点在最短期间内即将得到克服。
    我国劳动人民大力争取实现提高农业的措施。党和政府向苏联人民发出的参加开垦生荒地和熟荒地的号召获得了广泛的响应。在两个月中，五十多万苏联爱国者请求派他们担任开垦新地的工作。八万多名农艺师、工程师、机器操使者和其他工作人员担负起这项光荣的和重大的事业。难道这不是苏联人民的高度的精神上和政治上的团结一致以及他们的政治积极性和为建成共产主义而竭尽全力的决心的又一鲜明的证明吗？这也说明：我们的党、苏联政府和苏联人民的利益是一致的，工人阶级和集体农民的牢不可破的联盟是巩固的。
    我们社会主义的工业满足着农业在技术设备方面的必要要求。在颇短的时期内，已经有一万五千台强大的柴油拖拉机、数以万计的犁、播种机和其他农业机器运往开垦新地。我们充分相信：我们在两年中将胜利地开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地。一方面努力提高所有农作物的单位面积产量，
  一方面必须更合理地使用集体农庄和国营农场的所有土地，用开垦新地的办法进一步扩大播种面积，而新地我们是有不少的。
    现在全国正在进行春季田间工作。做好今年的春播，应该是增产谷物和提高一切农作物的单位面积产量的重大步骤。我们所有的地方苏维埃机关、党组织和农业机关都应引导农业工作者的劳动积极性，并保证有组织地进行春播以及春播以后的一些农业工作。我们具备有大力提高农业的一切条件，只是我们要善于利用这些条件。主要注意力应集中于加强集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的领导，加强区的领导。
    我们的许多领导干部在哪一方面还不够呢？我认为，在具体领导工作、及时指出缺点、纠正缺点方面，还做得不够。有不少这样的同志，他们只热心于列举为党中央所发现的那些缺点，但在自己的集体农庄或区里，在州或共和国中就不能指出具体的缺点，不能设法消除这些缺点，组织工作做得薄弱。机器拖拉机站和国营农场的每个工作人员、每个集体农庄庄员、所有农业专家应该努力消灭具体的缺点，改进每一集体农庄、国营农场，每一机器拖拉机站的工作。
    谷物生产是整个农业生产的基础。因此，党和政府正采取一切措施来进一步增加谷物生产，以便充分满足居民增长着的对粮食的需要、保证畜牧业有谷物饲料和充实国家的储备。这一任务是可以解决的。毫无疑问，这一任务将靠提高单位面积产量和开垦生荒地与熟荒地来解决。
    要使我们的工业为居民生产足够数量的纺织品、服装，就必须大大地扩大给工业提供原料的工业原料作物，特别是棉花、纤维用亚麻、大麻等等的播种面积并增加其总收获量。要能有更多的糖，就需要扩大甜菜的播种面积和提高其单位面积产量。要满足对水果和浆果的需要，就需要建立水果园、浆果园、葡萄园。但必须知道，要培植一个好的能结果实的果园，至少要八、九年的时间。每一个州，首先是莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔、顿巴斯、库兹巴斯及其他工业中心地区，以及远东各地区在今年必须解决对劳动人民的马铃薯和蔬菜供应这一任务。
    发展畜牧业对于保证居民的高质量食品供应和工业的原料供应，具有最重要的意义。但是，在许多州、边疆区和共和国内，在利用提高畜牧业的巨大潜力方面作得很差。按每一百公顷农业用地计算，牲畜头数还很少，牲畜的产品生产率还很低。每一个地区的集体农庄和国营农场都应当坚持不懈地努力在每一百公顷农业用地上得到和同一地区的先进的集体农庄和国营农场一样多的谷物、牛奶、肉、羊毛、皮革、蔬菜、马铃薯和其他产品。
    全国正在广泛地展开争取参加将于今年开幕的苏联农业展览会的竞赛。这一展览会在传播先进的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和农业生产革新者的经验以及科学成就方面，将起重要的作用；这一展览会在提高我国农业各部门的斗争中，将是一个强有力的杠杆。
    同志们，为了胜利地前进，就必须经常不断地、精益求精地改进国家机关的工作。苏维埃国家机关，整个说来，在解决经济和文化建设的任务中无疑是取得了巨大的成绩的。但是，除了成绩之外，我们不能不看到严重的缺点。目前我们有一种不好的作风：许多机关的工作重心不是如何组织工作，而是草拟大量各式各样的指示、指令和命令、各种参考材料和表报，举行许多各式各样使人脱离实际工作的会议，自从苏共中央作出了“关于党和国家机关工作中的严重缺点”这一决定后，已采取了一些具体措施来铲除文牍主义、官僚主义的领导方法，减少了许多多余的公文和表报，不断在加强对下层工作的灵活领导。但是应当指出，有些领导人员还没有根据党中央的指示作出应有的结论，所以到现在还没有改变自己的工作作风和工作方法。
    党中央委员会九月全体会议和二—三月全体会议揭露了苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部及其地方机构的工作中的严重缺点。但是，这些部的工作改组得很慢，其机构仍然庞大。如苏联农业部中就有着四百二十二个管理局、处、科，这一点就足以说明问题了。改组的结果是：该部的每两个工作人员中就有一个首长（全场哄笑）。必须从改组农业部的机构时所产生的缺点中吸取教训，不能容许这种缺点在其他部中出现。
    大家知道，最近曾通过了关于划小某些部的许多决定。经验证明，政府的部如果很庞大，如果领导许多国民经济部门和为数众多、种类不同的企业，那么，它们便很难对这些部门和企业进行有效的领导。因此，大家承认划小这些部是合理的。苏联最高苏维埃主席团的有关命令正送交最高苏维埃审议。有些部长认为他们的任务是组织许许多多庞大臃肿的机构。那么这里应当给他们改正。在进行划小各部的工作时应当注意，新部领导下的各机构的人员无论如何不得超过未划分前的原部原有的工作人员的数目。我想，这个建议不会受到个别的部长们的特别赞同的（场内现出活跃气氛）。但是我确信，这个建议的目的在于改进我们国家机关的工作，必然会受到代表们的支持（掌声）。
    各部的改组不应当是机械的，而是从提高国家机关的工作效率和进一步改进对企业的领导这一任务出发。为了这些目的，必须大大减少文件往来，过多的表报；无情地根绝领导上的官僚主义、文牍作风。只有这样才能改进国家机关的工作，并以数量更少的人员把组织生产的工作做得更好。如果我们采取阻力最小的路线，并且在新的部里设立庞大的机构，那么改组不会带来什么好处。各部（其中包括改组的部）所面临的任务是竭力改进对各企业的具体领导，从上而下提高每个工作人员对完成国民经济计划的责任心。据地方机关工作人员报告，到目前为止，各部、共和国和州的机构仍继续向他们发出无数的指示、指令和命令。譬如，利森农业机器制造厂在去年就接到机器制造工业部两千五百八十件各种各样的指示，在今年两个半月中接到六百四十件。该工厂的管理处在过去一年中发出各种各样的公文共有一万零二百五十件，在今年两个半月中发出三千件。古比雪夫州执行委员会（主席是别特鲁辛）去年就向各地发出了约一万二千件指示、指令和电报（全场哄笑起来）。这不禁使人想起萨尔蒂柯夫—谢德林在关于一个勤奋的首长的童话中所说的精辟的话。这位伟大的讽刺家写道：“倒霉的是那个地方，在那里首长漫无限制地滥发决议。”（大厅发出笑声）。你们看，这些话在今天也没有失去它的意义。
    在胜利发展国民经济的事业中，坚持不懈地厉行节约是起着重大的作用的。在国家预算中，规定拨出数以十亿计的款项用于经济和文化建设。必须以主人翁的态度使用这些资金，要精打细算地使用人民的每一个卢布，每一个戈比。
    同志们，应该承认：我们还没有根除在使用国家资金上的满不在乎的态度。甚至在负有严格监督执行财政纪律和节约使命的苏联财政部的系统内，也存在着编制臃肿的现象和组织财政工作中的很混乱的情况。事实上，卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的一些区，甚至在收税机关裁减以后，税收单位还有这样多：它们的工资额竟超过各该区缴纳的税款总数，这件事难道不正说明了惊人的混乱情况吗？（大厅哄笑起来）例如在卡列瓦尔区，税收单位全年工资总数是五万六千卢布，但是，该区税收单位收到的税款只有五万五千卢布（笑声）。在索奥雅尔夫斯基区，税收单位的工资总数超过两万六千卢布（笑声）。我们把很多资金花费在各个主管机关和机构多余的编制上面。必须坚决肃清这种不良现象，这难道还不清楚吗？
    我们的任务是，加紧与个别机关中的官僚主义恶习作斗争，集中主要力量来灵活地组织各企业、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、国营农场的工作，展开批评和自我批评，要坚决消除缺点。各级党组织、苏维埃机关、经济组织和工会组织应当更多地注意满足居民的日常需求，更深入地研究住宅建设、生活福利的问题，改善每个居民区的贸易和公共饮食业。
    同志们，我们辽阔的祖国的城乡各地正在展开一个全民的运动，争取进一步发展社会主义工业，增加消费品的生产，大力提高农业。莫斯科市和莫斯科州的各先进企业的职工展开了竞赛，争取高度的劳动生产率，争取在现有生产场地上增加产量、改善产品质量和减低成本，他们的爱国倡议正在受到各方面的支持，并正在广泛推广。列宁格勒、基辅和国内其他工业中心的企业中的竞赛日渐扩大。竞赛中不断出现许多新的劳动方法。但是先进者的倡议和经验并不是到处都受到支持的。遗憾的是，还有这样一些经济领导人员，他们不是去缜密地研究和积极推广新的、先进的事物，而是拒绝许多宝贵的建议。还有些工作员，他们仍然在用早已过了时的方法进行工作。他们只是满口高嚷这样一些“方针”：“加紧督促，老兄！”“我们催一下”，“我们检查一下”，“我们一定展开”，以及其他许多诸如此类的一些不负责任的、不会产生任何结果的空话。当然，这样的领导是毫无效果的。
    在任何一件工作中，守旧的、形式主义的作风都是不能容忍而且是有害的，在竞赛中，这种作风特别不能容忍。但是，在领导竞赛方面，还有着形式的、官僚主义的作风。有些企业规定了许多形形色色的报告竞赛的方式，订立了不少想出来的公约，结果扼杀了群众的创造性和主动性。哈尔科夫自行车工厂为了总结竞赛，制订了数十种各式各样的报告形式，仅根据其中一种关于推广先进劳动方法的报告形式，每个车间每月必须填一张包括一千多个问题的月报表（全场哄笑）。这一来，有数十名工作人员就不能去干有用的事情，而为编制和综合这些表格忙得满头大汗！这是最有害的官僚主义作风。必须坚决铲除官僚态度，坚决反对千篇一律地、刻板地组织竞赛的态度。
    社会主义竞赛，这是成千成万劳动群众的生气蓬勃的创造性的事业。它已成为共产主义建设的久经考验的方法。列宁在义务星期六中所看出来的共产主义萌芽，今天已成长为强有力的社会主义竞赛——劳动人民争取最快地完成国民经济各部门发展计划的伟大的运动。
    同志们，从事于和平创造性劳动的我们，一贯实行着和平的外交政策，在互利的基础上不断地巩固和扩大苏联与一切愿意进行事务联系的国家的事务联系。苏维埃国家发展的全部历史是苏联爱好和平的明证，是贯彻列宁所制订的苏联和其他国家的相互关系的原则的明证。我们的任务在于：今后仍然实行为各国人民所了解而且亲近的和平政策，巩固和外国的事务联系，在互利的基础上尽力发展和它们的贸易。
    早在苏维埃政权建立后的初期，列宁就曾说过：“有这样一种比任何一个敌对国家或阶级的愿望、意志与决定更有力的力量，这种力量就是总的世界性的经济关系，这种关系迫使它们和我们在这方面打交道。”事实证实了乌拉季米尔·伊里奇这些话的正确性。尽管形形色色的敌人使用各种阴谋诡计，苏联的对外贸易年年在扩大。现在我们在和五十一个国家进行贸易。一九五三年苏联与外国公司的贸易总额比一九五二年增加百分之十一，而与战前水平相比几乎增加三倍。资产阶级国家中承认急需发展和加强和我国及各人民民主国家的贸易联系的人越来越多了。例如，许多贸易代表团，特别是英国、阿根廷和其他一些国家工商界人士的代表团曾在最近几个月中到过苏联，并签订了一些重要的贸易协定。
    扩大与加强各国间事务联系的建议，以及苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施，获得世界各国的热烈支持和拥护。但是千千万万人民所拥护的事情却引起美国和其他国家某些显要人物的忿怒和恶毒的攻击。我所指的首先是美国国务卿杜勒斯先生。当苏联尽一切力量来缓和毫无理由的互不信任的局势时，杜勒斯先生却仿佛害了某种疯狂病似的暴跳如雷。在他的许多言论中都宣传实力政策；煽动战争歇斯底里和对人民的仇恨和蔑视；对许多国家，特别是对苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家进行威胁。全世界思想健全的人都渴望缓和国际紧张局势，而指责美国统治集团对拥有五亿以上人口的伟大的中华人民共和国所执行的歧视政策。这种目光短浅的政策必遭失败（经久不息的鼓掌声）。
    自从苏维埃国家成立之日起，我们不止一次听到对苏联人民的各种威胁，并且知道了这种手段的价钱。我们不怕威胁，威胁吓不倒我们。我们记得，希特勒和他的帮凶们在侵犯我国之前，如何大叫大喊苏联的软弱，企图靠牺牲苏联而谋利，并把其他帝国主义掠夺者都吸引到军事冒险中。结局如何，这是大家都知道的。毫无疑问，如果有人狂妄地模仿希特勒，他们将不可避免地遭到同样的命运
  （暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。决不要忘记历史的教训。这些教训是：第一次世界大战使社会主义革命在我国获得胜利，并在世界上建立了第一个工农的国家。第二次世界大战的结果，使欧洲和亚洲的许多国家脱离了资本主义体系，这些国家的人民勇往直前地走上了社会主义发展的道路，在自己国家内建立了人民民主制度。如果认为永远摆脱了资本主义的奴役枷锁的人民，只是为了取悦杜勒斯先生及其同流者而自愿再套上这一枷锁，那就未免愚蠢了（掌声）。
    如果帝国主义者发动新的战争，那么这一战争就必然会以整个资本主义体系的崩溃而告终（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我国人民不要战争，因为他们知道战争会带来流血、巨大的牺牲和破坏。全世界各国人民也不要战争，强大的保卫和平的运动就是明显的证明。
      如果杜勒斯及资本主义国家的其他人物发表言论时更加冷静些，那对和平事业就不知要好多少了。我们十分清楚，杜勒斯之流不喜欢苏维埃国家，更不喜欢共产党。我们也不准备说我们对资本主义有任何同情，因为资本主义制度无情地剥削工人阶级，奴役各国人民，使千百万的劳动群众过着难以忍受的生活。我们不干涉别国的内政，但是，我国人民和全世界千百万人民一样，对于正在进行反对殖民者和帝国主义侵略者的解放斗争的人民，一贯表示同情，并希望被压迫的人民在他们的解放斗争中取得彻底的胜利（经久不息的掌声）。
    同时，我们一直认为社会主义与资本主义的和平共处是可能的，既然存在着两种制度，那就必须加强它们之间的事务联系，而不应挑起互相的敌视和仇恨。各国人民对自己国家现行制度的态度应由自己决定。苏维埃国家今后仍将坚持执行和平的外交政策，争取国际紧张局势的缓和，努力发展各国之间的事务联系，并巩固世界和平（经久不息的掌声）。
    侵略政策的奉行者为什么要张牙舞爪实行臭名昭彰的实力政策呢？老实说，连这种政策的策划者自己也明白，用这种政策对待苏联、中华人民共和国这样一些大国是太唐突造次了。现在大家都可以看到，占世界三分之一以上人口的壮大的社会主义民主阵营的力量正在不断地加强和巩固。大家知道，一个人在暴怒之下往往会失去理智的。一个宣布国家外交政策的政治家对其他国家的人民满怀仇恨和恶意，这难道适合他的身份吗？盲目的仇恨就是是非的根源。美国资产阶级的报纸和电台在像杜勒斯先生这样一些政治家的教唆下，对苏联政府所采取的缓和国际紧张局势的一些措施进行最荒诞不经的、拙劣的歪曲。苏联政府提出的关于改善和资本主义国家的事务联系的建议，竟被一些资产阶级报纸说成是“苏联的经济炸弹”，说成是旨在征服世界的某种“共产主义者的阴谋”。帝国主义者十分清楚：苏联实行着和平政策，并不打算进攻任何人，为什么他们叫嚷着根本不存在的苏联的威胁呢？他们这样叫嚷是为了宣传。他们胡说什么虚构的来自苏联方面的危险，来恐吓人民，以便较容易地征取税收，保证帝国主义垄断资本获得高额的利润。帝国主义者煽起歇斯底里，以图证明疯狂的军备竞赛是正当的，他们希望靠军备竞赛来减轻日益迫近的经济危机的打击。美帝国主义者还想恐吓西欧各国人民，强迫这些国家的政府为军备支付更多的钱。西欧国家的经济本已极端紧迫，美国资本家就假援助之名把自己的军火出卖给它们，以榨取巨额利润和奴役这些国家。
    帝国主义者害怕和苏维埃国家进行和平竞赛，因为资本主义制度明显地经受不起这种竞赛。美国资产阶级的报刊上愈来愈频繁地反映出了一种恐惧心理，怕苏联的迅速发展和人民物质福利的增进会吸引资本主义国家的劳动人民。在这方面，四月十一日“纽约先驱论坛报”上的一篇文章是值得注意的，这篇文章说得倒挺不错。这篇文章写道：“当我们还在以‘落后的俄国人’这样一种破产了的神话欣然自慰时，庞大的苏维埃国家却在不断地以比西欧快得多的速度加强自己的经济实力。重心已移到消费品上去了。信不信由你，不过这确是二十世纪后半世纪中最危险的事件（全场哄笑）。可悲而不可置辩的事实（说明一下，可悲是对帝国主义者说的）是：战后苏联的工业和技术有了极大的进展，按俄国的标准说是极大的，甚至按我们的标准说也是巨大的。”这就是帝国主义老爷们所害怕的。
    世界各国劳动人民亲眼看到：政权属于人民的苏联和各人民民主国家胜利地执行着和平建设计划，一切都是为了保证不断提高人民的福利。我们将坚定不移地继续努力加强苏维埃国家，提高我国人民的生活水平，发展国民经济各部门。我们将不倦地加强苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的防御力量，以便在疯狂的帝国主义侵略者胆敢来破坏苏联人的和平劳动、侵犯我们祖国时，给以毁灭性的反击，再叫他们尝尝苏联人民及其英勇的武装力量在第二次世界大战期间给希特勒侵略者尝过的滋味（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）。苏联人民满怀信心地沿着通向共产主义的康庄大道迈进。不管敌人如何暴怒，他们阻止不了我们胜利地前进，正像阻止不了太阳的上升一样（经久不息的掌声）。我们生活在这样一个时代，在这个时代中共产主义建设事业已成为千千万万人的事业，这一事业的胜利已是无可怀疑的了（经久不息的掌声）。永垂不朽的、富有生命力的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说照耀着通向共产主义的道路（经久不息的掌声）。我们不朽的父亲和导师乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁所缔造和培育出来的、在为劳动人民的幸福的斗争中锻炼出来的苏联共产党，引导着苏联人民走向共产主义（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，继而转为欢呼。全体起立）。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日电）
