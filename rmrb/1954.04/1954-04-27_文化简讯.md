	China Blind Welfare Association Publishes "Blind People's Monthly"
	The "Blind People's Monthly," edited by the China Blind Welfare Association, was launched on March 15th and has now published two issues.
	The purpose of publishing the "Blind People's Monthly" is to provide blind people scattered across various regions with opportunities to learn cultural knowledge and understand current events and policies. Therefore, the content mainly includes national policies, current affairs summaries, blind people's life dynamics, blind character reform, and popular literary works.
	After the publication of the "Blind People's Monthly," blind people from various regions wrote letters expressing their welcome. All the blind veterans of the Liaoxi Province Veterans Recuperation Center wrote to say: "We warmly congratulate the publication of the 'Blind People's Monthly,' which has brought us new knowledge that we wanted to know but could not know in the past. We must study hard and become 'disabled but not useless' people to contribute our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland." Some blind people also put forward reasonable suggestions and criticisms on the layout of the "Blind People's Monthly" and the raised dots of the Braille.
	The "Blind People's Monthly" is printed with high-quality thick paper and sold at one-fifth of the cost.
	Special Economic Construction Stamps to be Issued for "May Day"
	The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government has notified post and telecommunications bureaus across the country to issue special economic construction stamps for "May Day." The patterns of this set of stamps reflect several major achievements in China's economic construction: the first pattern is an automated iron-smelting furnace—Angang's No. 8 blast furnace; the second is the Fuxin open-pit coal mine, showing automatic coal shovels loading coal onto trucks; the third is workers at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant assembling machinery; the fourth is a picture of a Northeast automated power plant; the fifth is a scene of a train passing through the elevated steel bridge of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway; the sixth is a picture of the Tanggu New Port and its wharf facilities; the seventh is an exterior view of the Harbin Flax Textile Factory; and the eighth is a scene of male and female members of the No. 429 Geological Exploration Team surveying underground treasures. This set of special stamps are all vertically rectangular and printed in intaglio. The two sides under each pattern are printed with fretwork patterns.
