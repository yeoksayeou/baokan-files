Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: The "Red Star" published today an article by Lieutenant Colonel S. Osipankov, commenting on the US action of establishing military bases in British territory.

Osipankov said that since the first batch of bombers of the US 28th and 307th Regiments landed on British territory on July 17, 1948, Britain began to become an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the United States. According to official statements, these aircraft came to Britain for "three months of training."

Six years have passed since then, and the US military has no intention of leaving Britain. Moreover, their number is increasing year by year. According to official figures, there are a total of 38,000 US soldiers and officers stationed there. But according to foreign newspapers, the number is over 50,000.

The US bomber bases in Britain are mainly concentrated in the airfield centers of "East England" and "South England." A special committee of the US House of Representatives allocated more than 12 million pounds this year to expand the nineteen bomber bases in Britain. Most of the US airfields in Britain can accommodate B36, B50, and B47 bombers.

Osipankov wrote that the British government bears 50 percent of the maintenance costs of the US bases on its territory. The maintenance costs of the US airfields in Britain impose a heavy burden on the British people and worsen the economic situation. The US maintenance of military bases in Britain not only makes it more difficult and impoverished for the British people, but also violates British national independence. US soldiers exercise the extraterritorial rights given to them by the British government, wantonly destroy British laws, and behave as if they were in a conquered country. Newspapers of all persuasions publish almost every day news of crimes, brawls, and other forms of rioting by US soldiers.

The article said that the existence of these bases on the British Isles poses a serious threat to the security of the British people. The British people are increasingly determined to demand the abolition of US military bases. The British people's struggle against turning their country into an "unsinkable US aircraft carrier" is combined with the common struggle of the people of the world to ease international tensions.

### 苏联“红星报”载文指出  美国在英国占有基地侵犯英国的民族独立

    苏联“红星报”载文指出
    美国在英国占有基地侵犯英国的民族独立
   【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：“红星报”今天登载了斯·奥西潘科夫中校的一篇文章，评论美国在英国领土上建立军事基地的行动。
    奥西潘科夫说，自从一九四八年七月十七日美国第二十八和第三百零七联队的第一批轰炸机在英国领土上着陆以后，英国就开始变成了美国的“不沉的航空母舰”。据官方的声明，这些飞机是到英国来受“三个月的训练的”。
    自从那时起到现在已经有六年了，美国军队还没有离开英国的意思。而且，它们的数目一年比一年增加。据官方数字，美国驻在那里的兵士和军官共三万八千名。但是据外国报纸说，这个数字在五万以上。
    美国在英国的轰炸机基地主要集中在“东英格兰”与“南英格兰”的飞机场中心。美国众议院的一个特别委员会今年拨出了一千二百多万英镑来扩建在英国的十九个轰炸机基地。美国在英国的飞机场大多数能够起落B36、B50与B47型轰炸机。
    奥西潘科夫写道，英国政府负担美国在它领土上的基地的维持费的百分之五十，美国在英国的飞机场的维持费给英国人民加上了沉重的负担，并使经济情况更加恶化。美国在英国保有军事基地不仅使得英国人民更加困难与贫穷，而且侵犯了英国的民族独立。美国军人行使英国政府给他们的治外法权，肆意破坏英国的法律，他们的所作所为就像他们是在一个被征服的国度里，各种倾向的报纸差不多每天都刊载美国军人的罪行、斗殴和其他形式的暴乱行为的消息。
    文章说，这些基地在英伦三岛的存在孕育着对英国人民的安全的严重危险。英国人民越来越坚决地要求取消美国的军事基地，英国人民反对把他们的国家变成“不沉的美国航空母舰”的斗争，是与全世界人民要求缓和国际紧张局势的共同斗争结合在一起的。
