Southwest China Begins Spring Plowing, Actively Increasing Grain, Cotton, and Subsidiary Food Production

Xinhua News Agency: The spring plowing season has generally started in most parts of Southwest China. Rice is being sown in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, as well as parts of Xikang and Guizhou. In Yunnan province's Dali, Lijiang, and Baoshan regions, cotton sowing has begun. In Guizhou province's Guanling, Zhenfeng, and Xingren counties, robust corn seedlings have already grown to two or three inches high.

In the spring plowing production, all regions have relied on state-owned farms and mutual aid cooperative organizations to drive the improvement of farming techniques for all farmers. The Qianning Farm in Xikang Province invited more than 40 local Tibetans to a forum on production techniques, explaining the preparation work and operational procedures for spring plowing, including seed selection, sowing, and fertilization, and demonstrating rice mud-water seed selection. The Rongchang County Farm in Sichuan Province also organized representatives from agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to the farm to learn the specific methods of cultivating strong rice seedlings, which vigorously promoted spring plowing. In Yiliang Region, Yunnan Province, when transplanting seedlings, many cadres went to the countryside and used market days and "local broadcasting" to conduct propaganda in the fields. In Jiang'an County, Sichuan Province, the mutual aid groups were divided into designated areas and a universal demonstration method was implemented, with 90 percent of farmers using mud-water seed selection for rice sowing this year. Due to the close attention paid to technical guidance in various places, advanced farming techniques such as "new-style seedling fields," "mud-water seed selection," and "good seed strong seedlings" have been widely promoted among farmers.

In addition to carrying out various water conservancy projects, the Southwest and various provinces have also piloted a number of pumping stations to help farmers with spring plowing. The promotion of new-style agricultural tools is also being actively carried out.

In order to strengthen the specific leadership of spring plowing, relevant departments of the Southwest first-level organs have successively organized more than 40 working groups to go to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang and other provinces to help with the work. Party and government leading organs at the provincial, regional, and county levels in Sichuan Province have also mostly transferred cadres to the countryside to inspect and lead spring plowing.

Capital Suburbs Farmers Increase Vegetable and Meat Production

The 358 agricultural production cooperatives and the vast number of mutual aid groups in the suburbs of Beijing are not only striving to increase grain production this year but are also paying attention to increasing the production of vegetables, fruits, milk, meat, and industrial raw materials. Led by 123 vegetable production cooperatives, farmers in the Beijing suburbs plan to expand the vegetable planting area by 5,000 mu this year. The vegetable planting area in the suburbs of Beijing this year is more than 160,000 mu, and it is estimated that about 700 million jin of vegetables can be produced, with the output of vegetable production cooperatives accounting for a considerable proportion. Suburban farmers have also developed the production of cattle, sheep, and hogs. The Jingxi mining area is expected to increase the number of cattle and sheep by more than 28,000 this year. The Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry originally planned to promote 15,000 apple, honey peach, and grape seedlings, but these seedlings still cannot meet the needs of various cooperatives, and many cooperatives plan to open nurseries and cultivate seedlings themselves. Many cooperatives and groups have expanded the planting area of cotton and oil crops. The farmers of Dongbeiwang Township in Haidian District accepted the state's cotton planting task of 1,200 mu, and after discussion by the township people's congress, unanimously agreed to increase it to 1,400 mu, an increase of 57 percent compared with last year. The Zhangguozhuang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District planted more than 1,190 mu of peanuts, an increase of 50 percent compared with last year. The cooperative also used hillsides and river beach wasteland to plant more than 600 mu of castor beans, which can increase the production of oil crops by more than 50,000 jin.

Because agricultural production cooperatives and some mutual aid groups formulated plans and began spring plowing preparations as soon as they were organized, the preparation of fertilizers, seeds, and agricultural tools is generally more sufficient than in previous years. In order to solve the problem of insufficient funds for expanded reproduction for some farmers, the State Bank and credit cooperatives have issued loans of 8 billion yuan. Supply and marketing cooperatives have also supplied various means of production in a timely manner, including more than 20 million jin of fertilizers.

At the same time, many of the more than 120 vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing are brewing the idea of signing production and sales combination contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. Large-scale vegetable production cooperatives such as Huangtugang, Baipenyao, Shuanghuaishu, and Xiaohongmen in the suburbs have recently discussed the content of the contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, and the Changhua State-owned Farm, which mainly grows vegetables, is also discussing the signing of contracts. The Rural Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee held a meeting on the 14th to review the draft contracts that these cooperatives have prepared and studied the methods for universally signing contracts based on these contracts. After these large cooperatives' contracts are further revised, they will be promoted in other cooperatives, and it is expected that combination contracts can be universally signed before the end of April.

Wheat Grows Vigorously in Hebei, Shanxi and Other Provinces

This spring, the rainfall and snowfall in North China were timely, and more than 50 million mu of wheat is growing vigorously, generally reaching six or seven inches high. Wheat in southern Shanxi and southern Hebei provinces is more than one foot high and has begun to head. Farmers in North China attach great importance to wheat field management in order to ensure increased wheat production. According to statistics from Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other regions in Hebei Province in mid-March, 40 percent of the wheat fields have been hoeed. In areas with water conservancy conditions in Tianjin, Tangshan and other regions, farmers are carrying out spring irrigation. In terms of topdressing, one-third of the wheat fields in Huanghua, Wu'an and other four counties in Hebei Province have been topdressed.

More than 30 million mu of wheat in Jiangsu Province are very robust, and some have grown to more than one foot high. Barley and naked barley in areas north of the Yangtze River have begun to head. The abundant rainfall and snowfall in Jiangsu Province last winter and this spring and the normal climate are conducive to wheat seedling growth. Farmers in various places pay great attention to wheat field management to strive for increased production. About 90 percent of the wheat fields in the province have been hoeed once or twice, and most of the wheat fields have also been fertilized reasonably in stages. The tens of thousands of mu of wheat cultivated by machines on state-owned mechanized farms such as Dongxin and Huaihai and the improved varieties of wheat such as "Xuzhou 438" and "2419" sown by farmers in various places grow better than ordinary wheat. At present, farmers in various places are paying attention to pest control to protect wheat seedlings. (Xinhua News Agency)

Jiangsu Province Plants Approximately 11 Million Mu of Cotton

Jiangsu Province originally planned to plant 10 million mu of cotton, but now it can reach approximately 11 million mu, an increase of 15 percent compared with last year; the total cotton output can increase by more than 16 percent compared with last year.

The farmers in Jiangsu Province are in high spirits to plant cotton as they had a bumper cotton harvest last year. There are many uncultivated wastelands containing salinity in the coastal areas north of the Yangtze River, such as Binhai, Sheyang, Dongtai, Dafeng, Nantong, Qidong, and Haimen counties. They are suitable for planting cotton, and the income is greater than planting grain crops and oil crops. Local farmers also have rich cotton planting experience. In addition, since liberation, the local people's government has led farmers to vigorously build water conservancy projects, completing more than 26 million cubic meters of earthwork in the past four years, so the cotton planting area can be expanded this year. More than 3.8 million jin of cotton seeds have now been transported to the areas where cotton planting is being expanded, and farmers are nervously turning the soil and leveling the land in preparation for sowing.

Songjiang and Zhejiang Provinces Develop Pig Raising

Songjiang and Zhejiang provinces have increased the number of hogs raised this year. Songjiang Province will raise 20 percent more hogs this year than last year to meet the needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, forest areas and the broad masses of the people for meat. At present, the province is taking various measures to develop hog production. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture is preparing to build a pig farm. This pig farm will raise a large number of fat pigs and be responsible for helping state-owned farms in various countries develop pig raising. Various counties have also begun to organize this work. Huachuan County has helped four collective farms, including Xinghuo and Hongguang, prepare funds to develop pig raising; each farm has transferred a member to learn new pig raising techniques.

Zhejiang Province plans to raise more than 3.3 million pigs this year, an increase of more than 66,000 pigs compared with last year. In order to complete this plan, many areas of the province have generally mobilized farmers to seize the opportunity to cultivate spring flowers and alfalfa after the Spring Festival, trying to increase the yield per unit area, and have expanded the area of crops such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins that can be used as feed without affecting rice production. Many counties and districts have also held forums for pig raising experts, livestock farmers, veteran farmers, and women to find many effective ways to increase feed sources and exchange experiences on how to save food and raise pigs well. In order to ensure that the hogs raised in various places receive the necessary refined feed before the newly planted feed crops are harvested, the Provincial People's Government's Grain Department has allocated a portion of miscellaneous grains to the supply and marketing cooperatives for supply to various places.

    积极增产粮棉和副食品
    西南大部地区农民开始春耕
    西南大部分地区普遍开始春耕。四川、云南两省及西康、贵州部分地区正播种水稻。云南省大理、丽江、保山等专区棉花已开始下种。贵州省关岭、贞丰、兴仁等县茁壮的苞谷幼苗已长二、三寸高。
    各地在春耕生产中，都依靠了国营农场与互助合作组织，带动全体农民改进耕作技术。西康省乾宁农场邀请当地藏民四十多人座谈生产技术，讲解春耕选种、播种、施肥等各项准备工作和操作过程，示范了水稻泥水选种。四川省荣昌县农场并组织农业生产合作社和互助组代表到农场学习培育水稻壮秧的具体作法，有力地推动了春耕。云南省宜良专区在撒秧时，不少干部下乡还利用了赶集和“土广播”在田间进行宣传。四川省江安县以互助组为单位分片包干，实行普遍示范的办法，百分之九十的农户在今年水稻播种中实行了泥水选种。由于各地抓紧了技术指导，“新式秧田”、“泥水选种”、“好种壮秧”等先进耕作技术在农民中广泛推广了。
    西南及各省除举办各种水利工程外，并试办了一批抽水机站，帮助农民春耕。新式农具推广工作也在积极进行。
    为了加强春耕的具体领导，西南一级机关的有关部门，先后组织了四十余个工作组分赴四川、云南、贵州、西康等省帮助工作。四川省、专、县三级党政领导机关也大都抽调干部下乡，检查和领导春耕。
  首都郊区农民增产菜蔬肉类
    北京市郊区三百五十八个农业生产合作社和广大互助组，今年除了努力增产粮食外，也注意增产蔬菜、水果、乳肉和工业原料。京郊农民在一百二十三个蔬菜生产合作社的带动下，今年计划扩大蔬菜种植面积五千亩。北京市郊区今年的蔬菜种植面积是十六万多亩，估计可生产蔬菜七亿斤左右，蔬菜生产合作社的产量，在其中占了相当比重。郊区农民们还发展了牛、羊和毛猪的生产，京西矿区今年预计可增殖牛、羊二万八千多只。市农林局原计划推广苹果、蜜桃、葡萄等果苗一万五千棵，但这些果苗仍不能满足各个合作社的需要，许多社都计划开辟苗圃，自己育苗。许多社、组都扩大了棉花和油料作物的种植面积。海淀区东北旺乡农民接受国家的种棉任务是一千二百亩，经乡人民代表大会讨论后，一致同意增至一千四百亩，比去年扩大百分之五十七。丰台区张郭庄乡农业生产合作社种花生一千一百九十多亩，比去年扩大百分之五十。该社并利用山坡、河滩荒地种篦麻六百多亩，可增产油料作物五万余斤。
    由于农业生产合作社和部分互助组一组织起来，就制订计划，着手春耕准备工作，所以肥料、种籽、农具的准备一般较往年充足。为了解决部分农民扩大再生产中资金不足的困难，国家银行和信用社已发放贷款八十亿元。供销社还及时地供应了各种生产资料，其中肥料就有二千余万斤。
    同时北京市郊区一百二十多个蔬菜生产合作社中有许多社，正在酝酿和供销合作社订立产销结合合同。郊区黄土岗、白盆窑、双槐树、小红门等大型蔬菜生产合作社已经在最近和供销社讨论了合同内容，以种植蔬菜为主的彰化国营农场也正在讨论签订合同。北京市委农村工作委员会十四日召开会议，对这些社已拟出的合同草案进行了检查，并根据这些合同研究了普遍订立合同的办法。这些大型社的合同进一步修订以后，将在其他社中推广，预计四月底以前就可普遍签订结合合同。
  河北、山西等省小麦生长旺盛
    华北区今春雨雪适时，五千多万亩小麦生长旺盛，一般已长到六七寸高。山西省南部和河北省南部小麦高达一尺多，已开始孕穗。华北区农民为了保证小麦增产，都很重视麦田管理。河北省邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区三月中旬统计，已锄过的麦田占百分之四十。天津、唐山等专区有水利条件的地区，农民都进行春浇。在追施肥料方面，河北省黄骅、武安等四县已有三分之一的麦田施过追肥。
    江苏省三千多万亩小麦多很茁壮，有的已长到一尺多高。长江以北地区的大麦和元麦已开始孕穗。江苏省去冬今春雨雪充足，气候正常，有利于麦苗生长。各地农民都很注意麦田管理争取增产。全省百分之九十左右的麦田锄过一遍到两遍，大部分麦田并经过分期合理施肥。东辛、淮海等国营机耕农场几万亩用机器耕种的小麦和各地农民播种的“徐州四三八”、“二四一九”等良种小麦，比一般小麦长得更好。目前各地农民正注意防治虫害，保护麦苗。　（新华社）
  江苏省植棉一千一百万亩左右
    江苏省原计划植棉一千万亩，现在可以达到一千一百万亩左右，比去年增加百分之十五；棉花总产量可比去年增加百分之十六以上。
    江苏省去年棉花丰收，农民植棉情绪很高。长江以北沿海的滨海、射阳、东台、大丰、南通、启东、海门等县有很多未开垦的荒地，土壤中含有盐质，适宜种植棉花，收益比种植粮食作物和油料作物大，当地农民也富有植棉经验，再加上解放后当地人民政府领导农民大力兴修水利，四年来完成土方工程二千六百多万方，因此今年可以扩大植棉面积。现在已有三百八十多万斤棉种运到扩大植棉的地区，农民正紧张翻土整地，准备播种。（新华社）
  松江、浙江两省发展养猪事业
    松江、浙江两省今年饲养毛猪都有增加。松江省今年将比去年增养百分之二十的毛猪，以供应城市、工矿、林区和广大人民对肉食的需要。现在全省正采取各种措施发展毛猪生产。省人民政府农业厅正筹备修建一处养猪场。这个养猪场将大量饲养肥猪，并负责帮助各国营农场发展养猪事业。各县也都已着手组织这一工作。桦川县已帮助星火、红光等四个集体农庄筹备了资金，发展养猪业；各农庄都已抽调一名庄员去学习新的养猪技术。
    浙江省今年计划养猪三百三十多万只，比去年增加六万六千多只。为完成这个计划，全省许多地区在春节以后即普遍发动农民抓紧培育春花和苜蓿，设法提高单位面积产量，并在不影响水稻生产前提下扩大了马铃薯、甘薯、南瓜等可作饲料的作物面积。不少县、区还召开了养猪能手、牲畜户、老农民和妇女的座谈会，找出了许多增加饲料来源的有效办法，并且交流了既能节约粮食又能养好猪的经验。为了使各地所养毛猪在新种的饲料作物收割前得到必需的精饲料，省人民政府粮食厅已拨出一部分杂粮交供销合作社供应各地。　（新华社）
