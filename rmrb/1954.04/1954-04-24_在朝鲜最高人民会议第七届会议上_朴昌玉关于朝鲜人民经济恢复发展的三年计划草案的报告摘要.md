The Pyongyang newspapers published on the 22nd a report by Park Chang-ok, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the Seventh Session of the Supreme People's Assembly, on the draft Three-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the People's Economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 1954 to 1956.

Park Chang-ok said: The draft plan for the restoration and development of our republic's people's economy is formulated for a period of three years. During this period, we must heal the wounds of the people's economy that have suffered from the war, and we must restore the level of industrial and agricultural production and the level of the people's material life to or above the pre-war level.

Park Chang-ok briefly recalled the colonial nature of the Korean economy during the forty years of Japanese imperialist rule and the great achievements made during the five years after the "August 15th" liberation through a series of democratic reforms.

Park Chang-ok then spoke of the profound disasters brought to the Korean people by the aggressive war launched by American imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang. He pointed out that the war of more than three years took the lives of thousands upon thousands of young people, caused casualties to millions of people, and turned our cities, villages, factories, railway facilities, ports, hospitals, schools, theaters and clubs into ruins. The losses suffered by the Korean people's economy due to the war amounted to more than 420 billion won (Korean currency) according to incomplete statistics. More than 8,700 factory buildings, 600,000 houses with a total area of 28 million square meters, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and clinics, 263 theaters and cinemas, and thousands of cultural facilities were brutally destroyed. The rural economy and transportation industry also suffered serious damage.

Park Chang-ok emphasized: Such a war is the most severe test for the lives of our people; it is a comprehensive test for the solidity of the social system and the state system established by our people. The social system and state system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea gloriously overcame the severe test of the war, and the war did not frustrate the brave spirit of the Korean people who love the independence and freedom of their motherland. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the political and ideological unity and solidarity of our people were not weakened but further consolidated during the three years of severe war.

Park Chang-ok said: Although our country and our people have suffered enormous losses and disasters due to the war, we have defended something more noble and precious than life and property—the freedom and independence of our motherland, avoiding the fate of being slaves of a foreign country once again.

Park Chang-ok pointed out that after achieving the historic victory of the just Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean people have embarked on the road of peaceful construction and have begun the work of comprehensively restoring the people's economy destroyed by the war. He said: Because the Korean people have political unity and solidarity, the superiority of our social system and state system, the rich natural resources of our country, and the comprehensive assistance of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries, we can say that in the recent three years, we will be able to victoriously restore the damaged people's economy.

Park Chang-ok then talked about the basic and specific tasks for the restoration and development of various sectors of the people's economy as stipulated in the draft three-year plan.

Regarding industry, the report pointed out that the draft three-year plan stipulates that the total output value of state-owned and cooperative industries should increase by more than 1.6 times by 1956 compared with 1953, and by more than 50% compared with 1949. The output of coal, coking coal, pig iron, ferrous metals, rolled products, cement, slate tiles, logs, and various types of paper will not only reach but also exceed the level of 1949. The output of electrolytic lead will increase by about one time, mining equipment by about 24 times, metal-cutting machine tools by about 62.5 times, agricultural machinery by about 16.5 times, bricks by about 16 times, cotton fabrics by five times, rubber shoes by about three times, and the catch of fish by about two times. To ensure such a growth in industrial output, the state will invest 37.36 billion won in the industrial sector in three years. The output of calcium carbide, caustic soda, chemical fertilizers, silk fabrics, and soap, etc., will not be able to reach the pre-war level temporarily.

In the power industry sector, our important hydropower stations and transmission lines will be restored within three years, so that the total capacity of power stations will increase by 1.35 million kilowatts, which is about the level of 1949. The restored hydropower plants will produce 3.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1956, which is 3.7 times that of 1953 and 64.1% of 1949.

In the coal mining industry sector, coal mining volume can reach 4 million tons by 1956, reaching the level of 1949, which is 5.6 times that of 1953. Thirty-two coal mines will be restored within three years. By January 1, 1957, the total output of coal mines can reach 6.3 million tons. In addition, three new coal mines with a total annual output of 2.5 million tons will be constructed.

In the mining sector, 24 mining enterprises will be restored. Compared with 1949, lead will increase by 3.8 times, zinc by 2.7 times, antimony by three times; the output of copper, gold, silver concentrates and other concentrates can be restored to the pre-war level. At the same time, large-scale geological exploration work will be carried out.

The production capacity of steel rails and rolled products in the metallurgical industry sector will reach the level of 1949, and the pig iron production capacity can exceed about 20%.

In the machine manufacturing industry sector, the production of mining equipment, pumps, agricultural tools, steam turbines and metal daily necessities must be quickly restored, and the production of equipment that our country could not produce before must be organized - metal-cutting machine tools, air compressors, motors, refrigeration equipment, cranes, steam boilers and ventilation equipment. For this purpose, a series of machinery manufacturing plants will be built, mainly mining machinery manufacturing plants, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, machine tool manufacturing plants, automobile repair and assembly plants that will be developed into automobile factories, automobile parts factories, prime mover manufacturing plants, heavy machinery manufacturing plants, tool factories, etc.

In the chemical industry, a huge project to restore the production of ammonium sulfate and nitrogenous fertilizers will be carried out, producing 150,000 tons of chemical fertilizers by the end of 1956. The reserve capacity for chemical fertilizer production should be adjusted. By 1956, compared with 1949, the production of building materials industry will increase cement by 1.2 times, bricks by 16.3 times, and slate tiles by six times. At the same time, the production of tiles and flat glass will be organized, and many factories will be restored and constructed.

In the forest and wood processing industry sector, the log production in 1956 should be increased to 1.4 times that of 1949, and the sawn timber products to 1.9 times.

In the light industry sector, the production of people's consumer goods in 1956 should be increased to more than twice that of 1949, cotton yarn by about four times, cotton fabrics by five times, paper by 26%, and shoes by four times. For this purpose, 42 enterprises in the food industry and light industry sectors will be restored and 11 new enterprises will be built.

In the aquatic products industry, in 1956, the catch of aquatic products and the harvesting of seaweed will increase by four times compared with 1953, and the processing of aquatic products will increase by six times compared with 1953. Three new aquatic product canning factories will be built and the necessary refrigeration equipment will be started, and fish farming will be carried out using lakes and swamps.

The report then talked about the rural economy. The report said: The cultivated area of farmland in our country increased by 2% in 1953 compared with 1952, roughly reaching the pre-war level. Restoring and further developing the rural economy is one of the most important tasks of the three-year plan. In order to promote the restoration and development of the rural economy, the government will provide comprehensive assistance and support in terms of the supply of agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers, the expansion of irrigation facilities, the provision of improved seeds and breeding livestock, and the provision of loans and the guarantee of materials, so as to ensure the significant growth of agricultural production within three years and create conditions for the more rapid development of the rural economy in the future.

In terms of total output of crops, it is now expected to increase the total output of rice by 31%, miscellaneous grains by 41%, vegetables by 3.4 times, cotton by 2.4 times, and tobacco by 5.7 times within three years. In this way, the total output of rice will exceed the pre-war level by 19%, miscellaneous grains by 9%, and vegetables by two times. The main condition for achieving such output is to increase the yield per unit area. The three-year plan expects that by 1956, the average yield of rice per *町步* will reach 3.4 tons, dryland grains will reach 1.1 tons, vegetables will reach 18.7 tons, cotton will reach 900 kilograms, and tobacco will reach 1 ton. [*translator's note: I am unsure how to accurately translate 町步, but it appears to be a unit of area*].

The report said: Our country currently has 27 state-owned farms. The task of state-owned farms is to improve their work so that farmers can see the superiority of large-scale production using tractors and complex machinery. Our country already has about 800 agricultural production cooperatives, absorbing 12,000 farmers to participate. Many agricultural production cooperatives have already achieved excellent results in their business activities. Members of agricultural production cooperatives have increased their business income and saved labor through collective labor. The state will provide extensive assistance to agricultural production cooperatives by allocating loans, supplying fertilizers, machinery, improved seeds, livestock, and the operation of state-owned agricultural machine farming stations and horse-drawn farming stations.

Regarding transportation and postal and telecommunications services, the report pointed out that according to the draft three-year plan, by 1956, freight transportation in the railway transportation sector will increase by 11% compared with 1949, and passenger transportation will increase by 7%. Railway freight transportation will reach the pre-war level by 1955. By 1956, the volume of freight transportation by sea and river will reach 1.4 times that of 1949; the volume of freight transportation by automobile will increase to more than five times that of 1949, and the volume of passenger transportation will increase to more than four times. The planned transportation volume and the improved use of transportation tools will meet the needs of domestic freight and passenger transportation. In terms of postal and telecommunications, by 1956, direct telephone and telegraph equipment between Pyongyang and the administrative centers of each province and county, as well as telephone equipment in the city, will be restored and significantly expanded. Wired broadcasting equipment will be set up to the administrative centers of the county and worker districts, and new broadcasting stations will be built.

Regarding raising the people's material and cultural living standards, the report said: The Party and the government always care about and pay attention to improving the material life of our working people. Measures to improve the lives of the working people are constantly being taken.

Retail prices were reduced three times in 1953. As a result, the retail prices of major daily necessities in state-owned stores and consumer cooperative networks were reduced by 20% to 69% compared with 1952. The reduction in prices greatly increased the actual income of workers and staff. At the beginning of 1954, the government again passed a decision to increase the wages of workers and staff by an average of 25%. In this way, the lives of workers and staff have been significantly improved.

The state provided huge assistance to farmers. In 1953, the state issued loans of 1.287 billion won to farmers to help them purchase livestock and build houses.

The draft three-year plan also stipulates measures to continue to improve the lives of the working people in the future.

On the basis of improving the production level, by 1956, the national income will increase by about 30% compared with 1949, and by more than 75% compared with 1953. The supply of light industrial products and food will increase by about 2.3 times in 1956 compared with 1953.

In order to ensure the supply of people's consumer goods and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the draft three-year plan stipulates further development of state-owned commerce and consumer cooperatives. By 1956, the amount of commodity circulation will increase to 73.8 billion won, which is 2.3 times the 31.6 billion won in 1953. The network of state-owned commerce and consumer cooperatives will expand by 94% compared with 1953. In addition, the state will continue to reduce retail prices from 1954 to 1956.

The draft three-year plan stipulates that the state will build houses with an area of 4.7 million square meters for urban workers, and assist farmers in restoring and building houses by issuing loans and providing extensive assistance with building materials. The state will restore and build public facilities and welfare facilities in cities and industrial bases. In this regard, the state will invest 3.9 billion won. In addition, the state will establish medical institutions in all county locations and larger villages, and the number of hospital beds will increase by 14.5% compared with the current number, the number of nurseries will increase by 10%, and the number of kindergartens will increase three times.

The report said that the people's education department should create the necessary conditions for the comprehensive implementation of the elementary compulsory education system in the near future. The number of students in junior and senior middle schools, technical colleges and universities will increase significantly. Excellent educational cadres should be trained to ensure the quality of teachers at all levels of schools. Improve publishing work and publish more textbooks and teaching materials.

The draft three-year plan stipulates measures to further develop national culture and art. Within three years, the number of seats in theaters, cinemas and clubs will increase to 187,200. In addition, the book funds of existing mass libraries will be replenished, and libraries will be established in all cities and county locations.

Regarding basic construction, the report pointed out that the draft three-year plan plans to invest 78.751 billion won in basic construction, which is four times the average annual investment amount of 1949 before the war. In the basic construction tasks, the cities destroyed by the war should be built into beautiful and modern cities. In order to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks, it is necessary to ensure the stability of construction technical workers, prevent labor mobility, improve labor organization, improve labor efficiency, mechanize operations, and improve and improve the quality of design work.

The report then emphasized that one of the most important conditions for ensuring the completion of the three-year plan, as instructed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, is to fundamentally improve the labor organization of enterprises and construction sites in the republic, improve the cultural and technical level of workers, adopt advanced technologies in all sectors of the people's economy, and mechanize heavy labor that requires a lot of manpower.

Park Chang-ok said in the conclusion of the report: The successful completion of the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war is a major step forward in further strengthening the democratic base of our country and realizing the peaceful reunification of our motherland. Our country will be built more beautifully and powerfully, and the material and cultural living standards of our people will be significantly improved.

As Marshal Kim Il-sung pointed out at the March Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the task of completing the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war is by no means easy. Many difficulties are superimposed on our construction road.

However, Park Chang-ok pointed out that we have the experience accumulated in the five years of peaceful economic construction in the past, the people's power tested and tempered in the three years of arduous Fatherland Liberation War to defend freedom and independence, and the heroic Korean people who fought heroically to defend and support this power and overcame the enemy and achieved glorious victory. We have the leadership and guiding force of our country, the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and the leadership of our leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, who organizes and guides our people to victory. As long as we implement Comrade Kim Il-sung's instructions in actual life, we will surely victoriously complete the arduous and glorious tasks of the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war that is put forward in front of our country and our people. There is no doubt about this.

Park Chang-ok finally said: All the Korean people must unite more closely around the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and like one person, rise up together to carry out the restoration and construction of the people's economy after the war for the unlimited prosperity of our country and the happiness and glory of future generations.

    在朝鲜最高人民会议第七届会议上
    朴昌玉关于朝鲜人民经济恢复发展的三年计划草案的报告摘要
    平壤报纸在二十二日发表了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相兼国家计划委员会委员长朴昌玉在最高人民会议第七届会议上所做的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一九五四年到一九五六年人民经济恢复发展的三年计划草案的报告。
    朴昌玉说：我们共和国人民经济的恢复发展计划草案是以三年为期而制定的。在这期间，我们一定要医治好遭受了战争破坏的人民经济的创伤，我们一定要把工业和农业生产水平以及人民物质生活水平恢复到或超过战前水平。
    朴昌玉概括地回忆了朝鲜经济在日本帝国主义统治的四十年间的殖民地性和在“八·一五”解放后的五年间经过一系列的民主改革所取得的巨大成就。
    朴昌玉接着谈到美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮发动的侵略战争给朝鲜人民带来的深重灾难。他指出，三年多的战争夺去了成千上万的青年的生命，使数百万人民遭到伤亡，并使我们的城市、农村、工厂、铁路设施、港口、医院、学校、剧场和俱乐部变成了废墟。朝鲜人民经济因战争而遭到的损失，据不完全的统计，就达四千二百多亿元（朝币）。遭到了残酷破坏的有：八千七百多座工厂建筑物、总面积达二千八百万平方公尺的六十万幢住宅、五千所学校、一千所医院和诊疗所、二百六十三所剧场和电影院及数千所文化设施。农村经济和交通运输业也遭到严重破坏。
      朴昌玉着重指出：这样的战争，对于我们人民的生活，是最严重的考验；对于我们人民所建立的社会制度和国家制度的牢固性是全面的考验。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的社会制度和国家制度光荣地战胜了战争的严重考验，战争并没有挫折热爱自己祖国独立自由的朝鲜人民的勇敢精神。在朝鲜劳动党、政府和金日成元帅的领导下，我国人民在政治上和思想上的统一和团结，在三年的严重战争中，不是削弱了，而是更加巩固了。
    朴昌玉说：我们国家和我们人民虽因战争而遭到莫大的损失和灾害，但是，我们捍卫了比生命和财产更加崇高更加宝贵的东西——我们祖国的自由和独立，避免了再一次做亡国奴的命运。
    朴昌玉指出：朝鲜人民在取得正义的祖国解放战争的历史性胜利以后，已经走上了和平建设的道路，着手进行全面恢复遭受战争破坏的人民经济的工作。他说：由于朝鲜人民有着政治上的统一和团结、我们的社会制度和国家制度的优越性、我们国家丰富的自然资源、伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的全面援助，我们可以说，在最近的三年中，我们是能够胜利地恢复被破坏的人民经济的。
      朴昌玉接着谈到三年计划草案中所规定的人民经济各部门恢复发展的基本任务和具体任务。
    关于工业，报告中指出，三年计划草案规定，国营及合作社的工业总产量到一九五六年要比一九五三年增加一点六倍以上，比一九四九年增加百分之五十以上。煤炭、焦煤、铣铁、黑色金属、压延品、水泥、石板瓦、原木、各种纸张等产量不仅达到而且要超过一九四九年的水平。电铅约增加一倍，矿山设备约增加到二十四倍，金属切削工作机约增加到六十二点五倍，农业机械约增加到十六点五倍，砖约增加到十六倍，棉织物增加到五倍，胶鞋约增加到三倍，捕鱼量约增加到二倍。为保证工业产量如此程度的增长，国家将在三年内向工业部门投资三百七十三亿六千万元。电石、苛性钠、化学肥料、丝织品和肥皂等的产量，暂时还不能达到战前水平。
    电力工业部门，要在三年内恢复我们重要的水力发电站和送电线路，使发电站的总能力增加一百三十五万瓩，即约可达到一九四九年的水平。恢复起来的水力发电厂将在一九五六年生产三十八亿瓩时的电力，等于一九五三年的三点七倍，一九四九年的百分之六十四点一。
    在煤矿工业部门，煤矿开采量到一九五六年可达四百万吨，达到一九四九年的水平，等于一九五三年的五点六倍。三年内要恢复三十二座煤矿。到一九五七年一月一日，煤矿的总产量可达六百三十万吨。此外，并将建设年产共为二百五十万吨的新煤矿三座。
    在矿业部门，将恢复二十四所矿山企业，和一九四九年相比，铅增加到三点八倍；锌增加到二点七倍；锑增加到三倍；铜、金、银精矿及其他精矿的产量可恢复到战前水平。同时要大规模地进行地质勘探工作。
    金属工业部门的钢轨和压延品等的生产能力将达到一九四九年的水平，铣铁生产能力约可超过百分之二十。
    机器制造工业部门，要迅速恢复矿山设备、抽水机、农具、汽轮与金属制的日用品的生产，并将组织生产我国从前不能生产的设备——金属切削工作机、空气压缩机、电动机、冷藏设备、起重机、蒸气锅炉及通风设备，为此将要建设一连串的机械制造所，主要是矿山机械制造所、农业机械制造所、工作机械制造所、将发展为汽车工厂的汽车修理装配工厂、汽车部件工厂、原动机制造所、重型机械制造所、工具工厂等。
    化学工业方面，进行恢复生产硫铵和氮质肥料的巨大工程，到一九五六年底生产十五万吨化学肥料。要调整对化学肥料生产的预备能力。建筑材料工业的生产，到一九五六年，和一九四九年相比，水泥将增加到一点二倍，砖增加到十六点三倍，石板瓦增加到六倍。同时，将组织瓦和平板玻璃的生产，恢复与建设许多所工厂。
    林产及木材加工工业方面，要使一九五六年的原木生产比一九四九年提高到一点四倍，制材品提高到一点九倍。
    轻工业部门，要使一九五六年的人民消费品生产提高到一九四九年的两倍以上，棉纱约增加到四倍，棉织物增加到五倍，纸张增加百分之二十六，鞋类增加到四倍。为此将恢复食品工业及轻工业部门的四十二所企业和新建十一所企业。
    水产业方面，一九五六年，水产品的捕获量和海藻的采获量比一九五三年要增加到四倍，水产业加工比一九五三年要增加到六倍。将新建三所水产品罐头工厂和开始进行必要的冷藏设备的作业，并利用湖沼河川进行养鱼工作。
    报告接着谈到了农村经济。报告说：我国农田耕种面积在一九五三年比一九五二年增加了百分之二，大约达到了战前水平。恢复和进一步发展农村经济，是三年计划的最重要的任务之一。政府为促进农村经济的恢复和发展，将以农具和化学肥料的供给、灌溉设施的扩大、优良种籽和种畜及贷款的贷予、资材的保障等予以全面的帮助和支持，以保障三年内农业生产的显著成长，创造今后更迅速发展农村经济的条件。
    在农作物总产量方面，现在预计在三年内把稻子总产量增加百分之三十一，杂粮增加百分之四十一，蔬菜达到三点四倍，棉花达到二点四倍，烟草达到五点七倍。这样，稻子总产量将超过战前水平百分之十九，杂粮超过百分之九，蔬菜达到两倍。达到这样产量的主要条件是提高单位面积产量。三年计划预计，到一九五六年，水稻平均每町步产量要达到三点四吨，旱地谷物达到一点一吨，蔬菜达到十八点七吨，棉花达到九百公斤，烟草达到一吨。
    报告说：我国现有国营农场二十七个。国营农场的任务，在于改善自己的工作，使农民看到利用拖拉机和复杂的机械进行大规模生产的优越性。我国已有约八百个农业生产合作社，吸收了一万两千个农户参加。有许多农业生产合作社已经在经营活动中取得了优良的成绩。农业生产合作社社员们以集体劳动提高了经营的收入，并节省了劳动力。对农业生产合作社，国家将以拨给贷款，供给肥料、机械、优良种籽、家畜和国营农业机器代耕站及马匹代耕站的作业等方法予以广泛的帮助。
    关于运输业和邮电事业，报告中指出，按照三年计划草案，到一九五六年，铁道运输方面的货物运输将比一九四九年增加百分之十一，旅客运输增加百分之七。铁道货物运输到一九五五年就将达到战前水平。到一九五六年，海上和河川的货物运输量将达到一九四九年的一点四倍；汽车的货物运输量将增长到一九四九年的五倍以上，旅客运输量将增长到四倍以上。计划的运输量和运输工具的改进使用，将满足国内货物、旅客运输的需要。邮电方面，到一九五六年，将恢复和显著地扩大平壤和各道、郡行政中心的直通电话、电报设备以及市内的电话设备，把有线广播设备设置到郡的行政中心和劳动者区，并建设新的广播电台。
    关于提高人民物质及文化生活水平，报告中说：党和政府对于改善我国劳动人民的物质生活，经常予以关怀和注意。不断地采取改善劳动人民生活的措施。
    在一九五三年就曾降低零售物价三次。结果，国营商店和消费合作社网的主要日常消费品的零售价格比一九五二年降低了百分之二十到百分之六十九。物价的降低使得工人和职员的实际收入大为增加。在一九五四年初，政府又通过了平均提高职工工资百分之二十五的决定。这样，工人和职员的生活就得到了显著的改善。
    国家给予农民以巨大帮助，在一九五三年国家就发放给农民十二亿八千七百万元的贷款，以帮助他们添购家畜和修建住宅。
    三年计划草案中又规定了今后继续改善劳动人民生活的措施。
    在提高生产水平的基础上，到一九五六年，国民收入将比一九四九年约增加百分之三十以上，比一九五三年增加百分之七十五以上。轻工业品和食品的供应，一九五六年将比一九五三年约增加二点三倍。
    为了保证人民消费品的供应和城乡之间物资交流，三年计划草案中规定进一步发展国营商业和消费合作社。到一九五六年，商品流通金额将增加到七百三十八亿元，等于一九五三年的三百一十六亿元的二点三倍。国营商业和消费合作社网比一九五三年将扩大百分之九十四。另外，在一九五四年到一九五六年间，国家将继续降低零售价格。
    三年计划草案中规定：国家将为城市工人建设面积达四百七十万平方公尺的住宅，并用发放贷款和广泛帮助建筑材料等办法来协助农民恢复和建设住宅。国家将在城市和工业基地恢复和建设公共设施和福利设施，在这方面，国家将投资三十九亿元。另外，国家将在所有的郡所在地和较大的里设立医疗机关，医院的病床数目将比目前增加百分之十四点五，育儿院将增加百分之十，托儿所将增加三倍。
    报告中说，人民教育部门要为在最近的将来全面实施初等义务教育制创造必要条件。初级和高级中学、技术专门学校和大学的学生数将显著增加。要培养优秀的教育干部以保证各级学校的师资。改善出版工作，出版更多的教科书和教材。
    三年计划草案中规定了进一步发展民族文化和艺术的措施。在三年内，剧场、电影院和俱乐部的座位将增加到十八万七千二百个。此外，并将补充现有群众图书馆的图书基金，在所有城市和郡所在地设立图书馆。
    关于基本建设，报告中指出：三年计划草案预定对基本建设投资七百八十七亿五千一百万元，这比战前一九四九年的投资额，平均每年增加四倍。在基本建设任务中，要把遭到战争破坏的城市建设成为美丽的现代化城市。为了保证基本建设任务的完成，要确保建设技术工人的固定，防止劳动力的流动，改善劳动组织，提高劳动效率，使作业机械化，并提高和改进设计工作的质量。
    报告接着强调指出：保证完成三年计划的最重要条件之一，正如同金日成元帅所指示的一样，是要根本地改进共和国各企业和建设工地的劳动组织，提高工人的文化技术水平，在人民经济的一切部门采用先进技术，使需要许多人工的重劳动机械化。
    朴昌玉在报告的结语中说：战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的胜利完成，就是在进一步加强我们国家的民主基地，实现我们祖国的和平统一的事业上迈进了一大步，我们的国家将建设得更加美丽、更加富强，我们人民的物质、文化生活水平将显著地提高。
    如同金日成元帅在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会三月全体会议上所指出的一样，完成战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的事业，绝不是容易的事情。在我们建设的道路上重叠着许多的困难。
    但是，朴昌玉指出，我们有着过去在和平经济建设的五年期间所积累的经验，有着在捍卫自由和独立的三年多艰苦的祖国解放战争中经受考验和锻炼的人民政权和为保卫和支持这个政权而奋不顾身地进行英勇斗争并战胜敌人、取得了光荣胜利的英雄的朝鲜人民。我们有着我们国家的领导和主导的力量、组织和引导我们人民经常走向胜利的朝鲜劳动党、政府和我们的领袖金日成元帅的领导。只要我们在实际生活中执行金日成同志的指示，就必将胜利地完成在我们国家和我们人民面前所提出的关于战后人民经济恢复发展的三年计划的艰巨而光荣的任务。这是无可置疑的。
    朴昌玉最后说：全体朝鲜人民要更加巩固地团结在朝鲜劳动党、政府和金日成元帅的周围，为了我们国家的无限繁荣和子孙后代的幸福和光荣，像一个人似地一致奋起进行战后人民经济的恢复建设。（新华社）
