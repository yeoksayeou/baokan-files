The Evil Consequences of the US "Embargo" Policy
Shi Chi

Since the Korean armistice and the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, as the international situation has tended to ease, business and political figures in capitalist countries have increasingly opposed the US "embargo" policy and demanded the expansion of trade with countries in the peaceful democratic camp. On February 25, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in a speech to the House of Commons, advocated "greatly relaxing" "trade restrictions" and hoped to open the way for trade with China at the Geneva Conference. In March, the Ninth Session of the Economic Commission for Europe unanimously adopted the joint proposal of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on expanding East-West trade; French Finance Minister Faure also stated before the meeting that the so-called "strategic materials" list should be revised.

The US "embargo" policy is creating increasingly strained relations between the US, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries. Recently, the US government dispatched Harold Stassen, Director of the "Foreign Operations Administration," to London to hold talks with the British and French governments in order to ease their serious conflicts over East-West trade. The United States had to reluctantly agree to discuss relaxing "trade restrictions" with other countries in the "near future," but forced Britain, France, and other countries to continue to abide by the "current control measures" on China and North Korea, that is, to continue to implement the "embargo" policy.

Obviously, the strong pressure exerted by the United States on various countries has encountered increasing resistance from business people in capitalist countries.

The US "embargo" policy is part of the US's aggressive actions against the socialist camp, and it attempts to use economic blockade to undermine the large-scale peaceful construction of peaceful democratic socialist countries, especially the People's Republic of China. To this end, the United States not only implements "embargoes" itself, but also forces the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass resolutions, using the banner of the United Nations to obstruct East-West trade. At the same time, the US armed forces actually directed the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan to carry out piratical looting and intercept ships of various countries coming to and from China. The US "embargo" policy hinders the development of normal international relations and hinders the easing of international tensions.

However, facts have proved that the US "embargo" policy cannot hinder the growth of the economic strength of peaceful democratic countries. The economic ties between socialist camp countries are becoming closer and closer, and the democratic world market is becoming increasingly prosperous. The United States' despicable attempt to suffocate the economic revival and industrialization of the People's Republic of China with the "embargo" policy has long been declared bankrupt. On the contrary, all countries that adhere to the US "embargo" policy have suffered serious damage. The United States uses the "embargo" policy imposed on various countries to carry out economic expansion and monopoly in the capitalist world, plunder raw materials and dump surplus commodities in large quantities, squeeze out the forces of Britain, France, and other countries in the capitalist world market, and strengthen its control over them.

In recent years, although Western European countries have reduced their imports from the United States, due to the shrinking of the capitalist market and the strengthening of tariff barriers and commodity dumping by the United States, their foreign trade situation has still improved very little. In 1952, the total trade deficit of Western European countries reached US$5.444 billion. From 1946 to 1952, other countries in the capitalist world were short of nearly US$32 billion in their trade with the United States. From 1947 to 1951, France shipped out more than 220 tons of gold to cover its overdraft of US dollars.

Even for the United States itself, its non-military exports began to decline in 1952, and decreased by 7 percent in 1953. The shrinking of domestic and foreign markets has deepened the crisis of overproduction in the United States. This is why the US business community has also begun to call for the development of East-West trade.

The US "embargo" policy has caused particularly serious damage to Britain, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries.

The US monopoly capital group uses the "embargo" policy as a tool to massively invade and attack Britain's market in Southeast Asia. In 1937, Britain's trade with Southeast Asia exceeded the United States by 50 percent. By 1951, the United States had surpassed Britain by 18 percent. In the past two years, the United States' advantage in this regard has expanded. The United States is also using Japan as a powerful assistant to squeeze out British influence. Japan's exports of textiles to Southeast Asia have greatly exceeded those of Britain. Market competition between Britain and Japan has become increasingly fierce.

Britain has always dominated the raw material markets of India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, and other countries, and obtained huge dollar revenues. In the past, exports from Indonesia and Thailand were also re-exported through Singapore. From the second half of 1951 to the first half of 1952, the US dollars that Britain earned from selling rubber in Malaya alone were almost equal to all of Britain's exports to the United States. However, due to the drop in rubber prices and sluggish sales caused by the "embargo" policy, Britain lost US$200 million in revenue in Malaya in 1953.

Trade between China and Britain once reached about 100 million pounds in the peak years. However, since Britain followed the US "embargo" policy, Sino-British trade has fallen to less than 10 percent of the historical peak. According to official British estimates, in the first eight months of 1953, the British government refused to issue export licenses to manufacturers who had trade contracts with peaceful democratic countries, and Britain lost more than 40 million pounds in trade, most of which were Chinese orders.

The sharp decline in Hong Kong's trade with mainland China is also the result of Britain's submission to the US "embargo" policy. In the first half of 1951, Hong Kong's trade with mainland China averaged about 274 million Hong Kong dollars per month. In the second half of the year, due to the impact of the "embargo," it decreased to an average of more than 143 million Hong Kong dollars per month. In the past two years, it has not even reached this level. Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham had to admit: "We have faithfully observed the United Nations embargo, but we have harmed ourselves." He also said that if the embargo on China is not lifted, Hong Kong's trade with other Asian countries cannot replace Hong Kong's trade with China, and Hong Kong's entrepot position will gradually disappear.

Japan has always relied mainly on trade with China to obtain supplies of many important raw materials and markets for commodity sales. After Japan implemented the "embargo" policy, its trade with China in 1951 plummeted to less than 1 percent of its total foreign trade. It lost the greatest guarantee of sales markets and raw material supply, and had to allow itself to be controlled and plundered by US monopoly capital. Japan's trade deficit with the dollar area was nearly US$1.5 billion from 1950 to 1952. At the same time, after Japan lost its source of raw materials in China, it had to purchase US raw materials at particularly high prices, which made the cost of manufactured goods too high and it was not easy to find sales outlets abroad. Even with the support of the United States, Japanese goods massively invaded the Southeast Asian market and grabbed a lot of business from the British, but it still failed to alleviate the trade crisis. In 1953, Japan's foreign trade situation deteriorated further, with a trade deficit of US$1,135,890,000, which was almost equal to the total export volume in the same year, breaking the historical record of excess imports. Obviously, only by getting rid of the shackles of the US "embargo policy" and resuming normal trade with China can Japan's economy have a way out.

The US "embargo" policy has brought particularly deep disasters to Southeast Asian countries that have always relied on the production and export of raw materials and food. The United States relies on its monopoly position as the largest buyer, threatening to reduce or refuse purchases and increase the production of substitutes, arbitrarily suppressing prices, making it difficult for Southeast Asian countries to sell their products and causing prices to plummet. According to statistics from the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, compared with 1951, the export volume of Asian countries in 1953 decreased: rubber by 13 percent, rice by 20 percent, tea by 14 percent, and vegetable oils and oilseeds by 36 percent. A report by the British "Natural Rubber Bureau" said that due to the drop in rubber prices, the income of Southeast Asian rubber producers decreased by US$575 million in 1953 alone.

At the same time, the United States took the opportunity to dump surplus commodities to Southeast Asian countries at high prices, causing these countries to experience huge trade deficits. The ten countries in Asia and the Far East had a trade surplus of US$748 million in the first half of 1951, but in the same period in 1952, it changed to a trade deficit of US$876 million. In 1953, although Indonesia adopted an import control policy, it still had a trade deficit of US$150 million; Malaya had a trade deficit of more than 300 million ringgits; and the trade deficit figures of other countries were also increasing without exception.

Under the impact of the US "embargo" policy, many countries in Southeast Asia have experienced extremely serious fiscal deficits and inflation in recent years. National industrial and commercial enterprises have reduced or closed down, tin mining and rubber industries have reduced or stopped production, the number of unemployed people has continued to increase, and the already low living standards of the working people have become even more impoverished.

Therefore, the governments and business circles of many countries that have been harmed by the "embargo" policy, regardless of the constraints of the US ban, are striving to restore and develop trade relations with countries in the peaceful democratic socialist camp. At present, there are more than 40 capitalist countries trading with the Soviet Union, and about 20 capitalist countries trading with China, and the trade volume is continuing to increase.

Obviously, breaking the US trade restrictions and developing normal international trade is not only in the interests of the countries engaged in trade, but also conducive to easing international tensions and promoting international cooperation.

    美国“禁运”政策的恶果
    施迟
    自朝鲜停战以至柏林四国外长会议以来，随着国际局势趋于缓和，资本主义世界各国工商界和政治界人士，越来越普遍地反对美国“禁运”政策，要求扩展对和平民主阵营国家的贸易。二月二十五日，英国首相邱吉尔在下院发表演说时，主张“大大放宽”“贸易限制”，并希望能在日内瓦会议上打开对中国贸易的道路。三月间，欧洲经济委员会第九届会议一致通过苏联和英国关于扩大东西贸易的联合提案；法国财长富尔并在会前表示应该删改所谓“战略物资”的名单。
    美国“禁运”政策正在美英法等资本主义国家之间造成日益紧张的关系。最近，美国政府派遣“援外事务管理署”署长史塔生到伦敦与英法政府举行会谈，就是为了缓和它们在东西贸易问题上的严重冲突。美国不得不笼络人心地同意在“最近将来”和其他国家商讨放宽“贸易限制”，但却强迫英法等国继续遵守对中国和朝鲜的“现行管制办法”，即继续推行“禁运”政策。
    很显然，美国对各国施行的强烈的压力，遭遇到了资本主义国家商界人士越来越大的反抗。
    美国“禁运”政策是美国敌视社会主义阵营的侵略行动的一部分，它企图利用经济封锁来破坏和平民主社会主义国家特别是中华人民共和国大规模的和平建设。为此目的，美国不但自己实行“禁运”，并且强制联合国大会非法通过决议，打着联合国的旗帜来阻挠东西方贸易。同时，美国武装部队居然指挥台湾国民党残匪进行海盗式劫掠，拦截来往中国的各国船只。美国的“禁运”政策，阻碍了国际正常关系的发展，妨碍了国际紧张局势的缓和。
    但是事实证明，美国“禁运”政策并不能阻挠和平民主国家经济力量的增长，社会主义阵营国家之间的经济联系愈来愈密切，民主世界市场日趋兴旺。美国企图以“禁运”政策来窒息中华人民共和国的经济复兴和工业化建设的可耻阴谋，早已宣告破产了。与此相反，所有奉行美国“禁运”政策的国家，却使自己受到严重的损害。美国利用强加在各国身上的“禁运”政策来在资本主义世界进行经济扩张和垄断，大量掠夺原料和倾销过剩商品，排挤英法等国在资本主义世界市场上的势力，并加强对它们的控制。
    这几年来，西欧国家尽管减少自美国的输入，但由于资本主义市场的缩小，美国加强关税壁垒和商品倾销的结果，它们的对外贸易景况依然很少起色。一九五二年西欧各国贸易逆差共达五十四亿四千四百万美元。自一九四六年至一九五二年，资本主义世界其他国家在对美贸易中短欠美元结账将近三百二十亿美元。在一九四七年至一九五一年中，法国运出了二百二十吨多黄金，以抵偿美元的透支。
    即使是美国本身，它的非军事性输出也从一九五二年开始衰退，一九五三年又降低了百分之七。国内外市场的缩小加深了美国生产过剩的危机。这就是为什么美国工商界也开始发出了发展东西方贸易的呼声了。
    美国“禁运”政策使英国、日本和东南亚国家遭到特别严重的损害。
    美国垄断资本集团把“禁运”政策作为一个工具，大规模地侵入和打击着英国在东南亚地区的市场。一九三七年英国对东南亚贸易超过美国百分之五十，到一九五一年美国已反过来超过英国百分之十八。近两年来，美国在这方面的优势又有了扩展。美国并利用日本作为排挤英国势力的得力助手。日本纺织品向东南亚地区的输出，已大大超过了英国。英国和日本之间的市场竞争日益激烈化了。
    英国一向支配着印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、锡兰、马来亚等国的原料市场，获得巨大的美元收入。过去印尼和泰国的输出品也经由新加坡转口。一九五一年下半年至一九五二年上半年，英国仅从马来亚出售橡胶所得的美元，就几乎等于英国本部对美输出的全部美元收入。但由于“禁运”政策造成橡胶的跌价和滞销，一九五三年英国在马来亚就损失了两亿美元的收入。
    中英两国的贸易，在过去曾在最高年份达到一亿英镑左右。但自英国追随美国“禁运”政策以来，中英贸易下降到了不及历史上最高水平的百分之十。据英国官方的估计，在一九五三年头八个月中，由于英国政府拒绝签发出口许可证给与和平民主国家订有贸易合同的厂商，英国就损失了超过四千万英镑的贸易，其中大部分是中国的订货。
    香港对中国大陆贸易的锐减，也是英国屈从美国“禁运”政策的结果。在一九五一年上半年，香港对中国大陆的贸易额平均每月约二亿七千四百万港元，到下半年因受“禁运”的影响，减少到平均每月一亿四千三百余万港元。最近两年还达不到这个水平。香港总督葛量洪也不得不承认：“我们忠实地遵守了联合国的禁运，但是却害了我们自己。”他又说，假如不解除对中国的禁运，香港对其他亚洲国家的贸易，也不能代替香港对中国的贸易，香港的转口地位势将逐渐消失。
    日本一向是主要依靠对中国的贸易，来取得许多重要原料的供应和商品销售的市场。日本奉行“禁运”政策后，一九五一年对中国贸易骤减到不及其对外贸易总额的百分之一，销售市场和原料供应失去最大的保障，只有任凭美国垄断资本的控制和掠夺。日本对美元区贸易差额自一九五○年到一九五二年亏空将近十五亿美元。同时，日本丧失了中国的原料来源后，不得不以特别高昂的价格，购买美国原料，使制成品成本过大，不容易在国外找到销路。即使在美国支持下，日本商品大规模侵入东南亚市场，在英国人手里抢了不少生意，但仍未能减轻贸易危机。一九五三年，日本对外贸易情况更加恶化，贸易逆差达到十一亿三千五百八十九万美元，几乎与同年全部出口额相等，突破了历年入超的最高纪录。显然，只有摆脱美国“禁运政策”的束缚，重新与中国恢复正常贸易，日本经济才有出路。
      美国“禁运”政策给一向依靠生产和输出原料和粮食的东南亚国家带来特别深重的灾难。美国仗着最大买主的垄断地位，以减购、拒购和增产代用品为要挟，任意压低价格，使得东南亚国家的产品销售困难，价格猛跌。据亚洲与远东经济委员会的统计，一九五三年亚洲国家的出口量，与一九五一年比较：橡胶降低百分之十三，大米降低百分之二十，茶叶降低百分之十四，植物油和油料种子降低百分之三十六。英国“天然橡胶局”报告书说，由于橡胶跌价，仅在一九五三年内，东南亚橡胶生产者的收入就减少了五亿七千五百万美元。
    同时，美国并乘机以高昂的价格向东南亚国家倾销过剩商品，使这些国家发生巨大的贸易逆差。亚洲和远东的十个国家在一九五一年上半年出超七亿四千八百万美元，到一九五二年同期就一变而为入超八亿七千六百万美元。在一九五三年，印尼虽采取入口统制政策，但仍入超一亿五千万美元；马来亚入超三亿多叻元；其他国家的贸易逆差数字，也都没有例外地增加着。
    在美国“禁运”政策的打击下，近年来东南亚许多国家的财政赤字和通货膨胀，极为严重。民族工商业纷纷缩减或歇业，锡矿业橡胶业纷纷减产或停止生产，失业人数不断增多，生活水平本来很低的劳动人民更加贫困化了。
    因此，许多被“禁运”政策所损害的国家的政府和企业界，不顾美国禁令的约束，争取与和平民主社会主义阵营国家恢复和发展贸易关系。目前，与苏联进行贸易的资本主义国家已有四十多个，与中国进行贸易的资本主义国家已有二十个左右，贸易额也在继续增加。
    显然，打破美国的贸易限制，发展正常的国际贸易，不仅符合于进行贸易的各国的利益，并且有利于缓和国际局势和促进国际合作。
