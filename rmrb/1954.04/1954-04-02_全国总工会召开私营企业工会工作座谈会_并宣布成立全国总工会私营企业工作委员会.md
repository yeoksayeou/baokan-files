The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) convened a symposium on trade union work in private enterprises from March 16th to 26th to understand the situation of trade union work in private enterprises across the country since the nationwide publicity of the general line of the state during the transition period, and to prepare for the upcoming Second National Conference on Trade Union Work in Private Enterprises this year. The meeting also focused on discussing trade union work in state capitalist enterprises of advanced and intermediate forms.

The symposium was summarized by Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the ACFTU. He said: Since the nationwide large-scale publicity of the general line of the state during the transition period, progressive capitalists have expressed welcome and support and are more actively approaching the government, and have also shown better performance in business management. Some capitalists do not understand the general line enough and are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Another small number of capitalists do not understand the greater good and resist in many ways. Lai Ruoyu said: The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the task of the people of the whole country. Trade union workers should not regard it as just the government's business. Trade union organizations should actively take on this task, mobilize workers, educate and promote capitalists, and implement this transformation from within the enterprise. In order to make the transformation more effective, trade union workers must firmly grasp the two links of mastering policy and doing a good job in production.

Regarding trade union work in state capitalist enterprises of advanced and intermediate forms, Lai Ruoyu gave more detailed instructions. He said: Enterprises engaged in processing and ordering account for a large proportion of the entire capitalist industry. The quality of production in these factories has a great impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, trade union workers in these private enterprises should focus on production, mobilize workers to supervise capitalists, and prevent them from repeating the "five poisons" and evading funds and wasting funds. In order to ensure that these enterprises complete the state's processing and ordering tasks, the trade union must launch a production increase and economy practice campaign under the slogan of "completing the processing and ordering tasks on time in accordance with the quality and quantity stipulated in the public-private contract, in order to meet the needs of national construction and the people," improve product quality, reduce costs, and complete the processing and ordering tasks on time and strive to complete them ahead of schedule. At the same time, through the competition, improve business management and prepare conditions for the transition to advanced forms. These enterprises should organize production increase and economy committees and make them an important organizational form for realizing and implementing the leadership of the Party and the government over capitalist enterprises. In enterprises that have already implemented joint public-private ownership or are preparing to implement joint public-private ownership, the trade union should mobilize workers to do a good job in production and welcome joint ownership; assist public shareholders in their work, improve business management, and learn from state-owned factories.

Lai Ruoyu finally pointed out: In order for trade union organizations to complete the tasks they undertake in the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the departments in charge of trade union work in private enterprises in trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen policy learning and strengthen investigation and research.

Thirty-eight people attended this symposium, including cadres in charge of trade union work in private enterprises from the six major administrative regions and eight major cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Beijing, Shenyang, and Xi'an, representatives from sixteen grassroots trade unions, and representatives from relevant industrial trade unions. At this symposium, in order to better lead and promote trade union work in private enterprises, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced the establishment of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Private Enterprise Work Committee. Dong Xin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, concurrently serves as the director, Li Xiuren and Wu Ming serve as deputy directors, and Hou Che, Han Wucheng, Chen Haowen, Zhang Jing and other nineteen cadres in charge of trade union work in private enterprises from the North China Region and six major cities including Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union, and the Light Industry Trade Union Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, etc., serve as members.

    全国总工会召开私营企业工会工作座谈会
    并宣布成立全国总工会私营企业工作委员会
    中华全国总工会在三月十六日到二十六日召开全国私营企业工会工作座谈会，了解自全国宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线以来各地私营企业工会工作的情况，为今年将召开的全国第二届私营企业工会工作会议作准备。会议并着重讨论了在高级形式和中级形式的国家资本主义企业中的工会工作问题。
    座谈会由全国总工会主席赖若愚作总结。他说：自全国大规模宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线以来，进步的资本家表示欢迎和拥护，比较积极地靠拢政府，在经营管理上也有较好的表现。一部分资本家对总路线不够了解，抱着观望的态度。另一部分为数不多的资本家不明大义，多方面抗拒。赖若愚说：对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造是全国人民的任务。工会工作者更不要把它看做只是政府的事情，工会组织应该积极担负起这个任务，发动职工，教育和推动资本家，从企业内部实行这种改造。为使改造进行得更有力，工会工作者必须抓紧掌握政策和搞好生产这两个环节。
    关于高级形式和中级形式的国家资本主义企业中的工会工作，赖若愚作了较详细的指示。他说：加工订货的企业在整个资本主义工业中占了很大的比重。这些工厂生产的好坏，对国计民生影响很大。因此，这些私营企业中的工会工作者应该以生产为中心，发动工人监督资本家，防止其重犯“五毒”以及逃避资金、浪费资金等行为。为了使这些企业保证完成国家的加工订货任务，工会要在“按照公私合同所规定的质和量，准时完成加工订货任务，以满足国家建设和人民的需要”的口号下，发动职工开展增产节约竞赛，提高产品质量，降低成本，按时和争取提前完成加工订货任务，同时要通过竞赛，改进经营管理，为过渡到高级形式准备条件。这些企业应该组织增产节约委员会，并使它成为实现和贯彻党和政府对资本主义企业的领导的重要的组织形式。在已经实行公私合营或正在准备实行公私合营的企业中，工会要发动工人，搞好生产，迎接合营；协助公股代表进行工作，改进经营管理，向国营厂看齐。
    赖若愚最后指出：工会组织要完成它在国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造中所担当的任务，各级工会组织中负责私营企业工会工作的部门必须加强政策学习，加强调查研究。
    出席这次座谈会的有六大行政区和上海、天津、武汉、广州、重庆、北京、沈阳、西安八大城市负责私营企业工会工作的干部，十六个基层工会的代表和有关产业工会的代表共三十八人。在这次座谈会上，全国总工会为了更好地领导和推动私营企业的工会工作，宣布成立全国总工会私营企业工作委员会。由全国总工会书记处书记董昕兼主任，李修仁、吴明任副主任，华北区和上海、天津等六大城市以及纺织工会全国委员会、全国总工会轻工业工会工作委员会等七个产业工会领导私营企业工会工作的干部侯彻、韩武成、陈好问、张静等十九人为委员。（新华社）
