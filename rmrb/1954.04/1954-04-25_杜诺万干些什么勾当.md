What Kind of Dirty Deeds is Donovan Up To?
　　Gu Yin

　　On the eve of the Geneva Conference, the movements of American diplomatic officials are particularly noticeable. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's hurried trip to London and Paris for a "lightning visit" is certainly seen as a political weathervane; and the "leisurely" "vacation home" of U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Donovan also aroused people's interest.

　　Since Donovan left Thailand on March 15, he has spent a lot of time at the State Department in Washington. Although officials said he was "on vacation at home," and he himself refused to explain the purpose of his return, according to a Washington dispatch from the International News Service on April 13: "Donovan's urgency is just like Dulles’...urgency of his trip to London and Paris"; he is in the United States "consulting on Dulles's proposed joint action plan" and is also working hard to organize an alliance including Thailand and the Indochinese puppet groups, "as the core of a united front in Asia against communism." It is very obvious that Donovan's "vacation" is, like Dulles's "visit," to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand intervention in the Indochina War.

　　Donovan is a well-known American spy chief. Since he came to Southeast Asia last year under the guise of the U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, he has traveled to Indochina, Pakistan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea to carry out conspiratorial activities, and has had extensive contacts with reactionaries in various Far Eastern countries. According to the International News Service, he "has become a central figure in the U.S. plan to form an anti-communist united front in Southeast Asia" and "plays an important role in urging countries to accept the united front." Therefore, it is no accident that Dulles chose Donovan as the executor of the U.S. plan to establish a "united front" in Southeast Asia, asking him to give this plan a "concrete start" before the Geneva Conference.

　　However, what are the prospects for Donovan's conspiracy? In this regard, a New York dispatch from the International News Service on April 6 provided some noteworthy materials. The news revealed that "based on talks with responsible U.S. and foreign officials, careful analysis of opinions in various newspaper editorials, and talks with many ordinary citizens," the "situation" in the five so-called "extremely important regions to the United States" in the Far East "is not good," and this situation "will greatly worsen." The International News Service admitted: "The prestige of the United States in the Far East has reached an astonishing and unprecedented low," because "Americans often participate excessively in the affairs of other countries, to the point of almost blatant interference." Donovan, like Dulles, is precisely the person who blatantly interferes in the Indochina War, so the prospects for his conspiracy are also "not good."

　　Dulles openly admitted that the intervention in the Indochina War was for the "rice granary" of Southeast Asia, and for the raw materials of Southeast Asia such as "tin, oil, rubber and iron sand." Donovan played the criminal role of implementing Dulles's policy of plundering the "rice granary" and raw materials of Southeast Asia. However, the American "Worker's Daily" said it well: The "rice granary" and raw materials of Southeast Asia "belong to the people of Asia." Indeed, it will never be a small group of American politicians who create new wars that will determine the fate of this region, but the masters of this region - the Asian people themselves.

    杜诺万干些什么勾当
    谷音
      日内瓦会议前夕，美国外交官员们的行踪特别惹人注意。美国国务卿杜勒斯匆忙地跑到伦敦和巴黎去进行“闪电式的访问”，固然被人们看作是政治风标；而美国驻泰国大使杜诺万“悠闲地”“回家休假”，也使人们颇感兴趣。
    杜诺万自从三月十五日离开泰国后，曾到华盛顿国务院呆了许多时候，虽然官方说他是“回家休假”，他本人也拒绝说明他这次返国的任务，可是，据国际新闻社四月十三日华盛顿电讯透露：“杜诺万工作的急迫性正如杜勒斯……伦敦和巴黎之行的急迫性一样”；他正在美国“磋商杜勒斯建议的联合行动计划”，还在努力组织一个包括泰国和印度支那傀儡集团的联盟，“作为亚洲反对共产主义的联合阵线的核心”。杜诺万的“休假”和杜勒斯的“访问”一样，是为了破坏日内瓦会议和扩大干涉印度支那战争，这是很明显的。
    杜诺万是著名的美国特务头子。自从他去年披着驻泰国大使的外衣来到东南亚之后，曾先后到印度支那、巴基斯坦、香港、菲律宾、日本和南朝鲜等地进行过阴谋活动，和远东各国的反动派有着广泛的接触，照国际新闻社的说法，他“今天已成为美国在东南亚结成反共联合阵线计划中的中心人物”，“在促使各国接受联合阵线的工作中，他起很重要的作用。”因此，杜勒斯选定了杜诺万为美国在东南亚建立“联合阵线”的执行人，要他在日内瓦会议之前使这个计划有一个“具体的开端”，并不是偶然的。
    然而，杜诺万阴谋活动的前景如何呢？在这方面，国际新闻社四月六日的纽约电讯提供了一些值得注意的材料。这个消息透露：“根据美国和外国负责官员们的谈话、对各报社论的意见所作的仔细分析和许多普通公民的谈话得出的结论”，远东五个所谓“对美国极端重要的地区”的“情况是不妙的”，而且这种情况“还要大大恶化”。国际新闻社承认：“美国在远东的威信已达到惊人的空前低落的地步”，原因就是“美国人常常过分参预其他国家的事务，以至几乎达到公然干涉的地步。”杜诺万和杜勒斯一样，正是公然干涉印度支那战争的人，因此，他阴谋活动的前景同样是“不妙的”。
    杜勒斯公开承认干涉印度支那战争是为了东南亚的“米仓”，为了东南亚的“锡、石油、橡胶和铁砂”等原料，杜诺万充当了执行杜勒斯抢劫东南亚“米仓”和原料政策的罪恶角色。然而，美国“工人日报”说得好：东南亚的“米仓”和原料“都是属于亚洲人民的”。的确决定这个地区的命运的决不会是美国一小撮制造新战争的政客，而是这个地区的主人——亚洲人民自己。
