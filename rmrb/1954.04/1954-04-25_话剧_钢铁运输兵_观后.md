Review of the Play "Steel Transportation Soldiers"
Cao Xin
Playwright: Huang Ti
Director: Wu Xue
Performed by: China Youth Art Theater

I watched the four-act, six-scene play "Steel Transportation Soldiers" performed by the China Youth Art Theater with excitement and joy. Our literary and art workers have made great efforts to use literary and artistic forms such as communications, novels, and poems to praise the heroic deeds of resisting America and aiding Korea; however, there are not many plays based on the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This makes us pay more attention to the performance of this play. The playwright Huang Ti and all the actors of the China Youth Art Theater went deep into the battlefield and experienced the advanced thinking and vigorous combat enthusiasm of the Volunteers more deeply in the combat life. They created moving heroic images of the Volunteers, bringing the events of the autumn of 1951, when the Korean and Chinese People's forces shattered Van Fleet's "Autumn Offensive," vividly to the stage, giving the audience a deep impression and powerful encouragement.

In the autumn of 1951, our army was in the most difficult period after the five victorious campaigns. Floods unprecedented in Korea for thirty years had destroyed most of the bridges and roads, and supplies were very difficult. The enemy launched the "Autumn Offensive" against our army during this period, concentrating its forces to carry out the so-called "strangulation war" on the throat areas of the vast rear of North Korea, using all kinds of vicious means to destroy our transportation lines. The number of enemy aircraft sorties and the amount of bombs dropped during and after the "Autumn Offensive" increased thirty to forty times compared to January 1951. The enemy attempted to cut off our transportation lines with indiscriminate bombing. Under such circumstances, the logistics staff, railway corps, Korean laborers, train and truck drivers, loaders and unloaders, warehouse managers, and air defense forces on our transportation lines bravely undertook the arduous and complex task of fighting the mad American air pirates, wind, rain, and floods. They tried every means to protect every transportation line with their labor, bravery, and wisdom, so that our transportation volume not only did not decrease, but increased day by day.

"Steel Transportation Soldiers" describes the heroic deeds of a branch of the transportation line—the truck drivers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. A company of a certain motor transport regiment was ordered to rush artillery shells to support the front-line troops in counterattacking the enemy's offensive against Tiande Mountain and Yueye Mountain. The motor transport company was blocked by the river bridge that had been blown up by enemy aircraft during the march, and the highway to the rear was also cut off by another vehicle loaded with ammunition that had been hit by enemy aircraft and exploded. The vehicles that had returned to hide near the river bridge and the vehicles parked on the road were crowded together. Enemy aircraft were flying low and circling in the sky, and had begun to drop flares. The situation was very urgent. If the target was exposed, all the dozens of vehicles blocked would inevitably suffer serious losses, which would seriously affect the war on the front line. At this time, the protagonist of the play, Gao Keying, stepped forward and suggested that he drive an empty vehicle out of the pedestrian path to divert the enemy aircraft with lights, in order to buy time to evacuate the vehicles and repair the river bridge. With the commander's consent, Gao Keying completed this arduous task, allowing all the vehicles to escape from danger and successfully deliver the artillery shells to the front line. Through several interconnected stories, the author vividly reflects the complex and arduous struggle of the Volunteer truck drivers against the enemy on the transportation line; showing their noble qualities of loving the motherland and the Korean people, and their high sense of responsibility for the war and for victory. The plot and character images on the stage gave the audience a vivid education in internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary heroism.

The protagonist, Gao Keying, is a resourceful and brave young soldier. He loves the motherland, the Korean people, and every Korean child. He transforms his love for the motherland and his sympathy for the Korean people into combat power. In his daily work, he endures hardships with great perseverance and sticks to his post; he constantly helps his comrades pull and repair cars; he sincerely and kindly educates and encourages the comrades around him in various ways; and he is always concerned about the victory of the war. In extremely urgent situations, he does not hesitate to risk his life to divert enemy aircraft, so that the vehicles of the entire company are safe. This noble act of revolutionary heroism deeply moved the audience.

"Steel Transportation Soldiers" reflects the unbreakable fighting unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Grandma Jin kindly takes care of every Volunteer soldier, just like taking care of her own children. Sister-in-law Jin left her elderly mother-in-law and young daughter Xiao Yingzi, and led the labor team and Volunteer engineers to repair roads and bridges day and night to support the war. When she heard that her young daughter had an unexpected misfortune, and saw the injured Gao Keying, she suppressed the anxiety and pain in her heart and carefully rescued the Volunteer soldier Gao Keying. This is completely understandable. The Chinese and Korean people share weal and woe and are united like a family. Every Volunteer soldier also regards the suffering of the Korean people as their own suffering. At the end of the second act of the play, Gao Keying shouted his determination in a steel-like firm and powerful voice: "Heaven and earth cannot stop us!" The bloody atrocities of American toy bombs killing the Korean child Xiao Zhenzi and blinding Xiao Yingzi tore Gao Keying's heart. The experiences of Sister-in-law Jin's family made us deeply realize how deep the suffering the Korean people have endured! They held down their wounds, straightened their chests, and fought stubbornly against the enemy, defending their motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world. It was on the basis of this patriotic and internationalist ideological sentiment, in the revolutionary struggle against the common enemy, that the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples was established.

"Steel Transportation Soldiers" reflects the high revolutionary optimism shown by the heroic Volunteer drivers in the arduous struggle of "enemy aircraft overhead, and time bombs underfoot." This spirit of optimism permeates the details of the entire play. The author portrays a group of loyal and dedicated Volunteer soldiers who serve the people wholeheartedly and do not care about personal gains or losses. They have become familiar with the laws of fighting the enemy, and have sufficient fighting experience and confidence in victory. This makes them full of calmness, joy, and optimism in any difficult situation.

Naturally, the play "Steel Transportation Soldiers" still has shortcomings, and in some places it gives people a feeling of being not real enough. For example, in the second act, the author overemphasizes that the enemy aircraft's circling bombing is to drop bombs so that they can go back and "report the task." This portrays the enemy as too useless, thereby weakening the hardship of our struggle against the enemy and the significance of our victory. If the author could strengthen the description of the difficult situation, it would be more in line with the actual situation at that time, and it would be more able to show the Volunteer's indomitable heroic spirit and great revolutionary spirit.

Despite its shortcomings, this play is basically good and can give people a healthy ideological education. The comrades of the China Youth Art Theater have put the play on the stage with great effort, which is a very meaningful work.

    话剧“钢铁运输兵”观后
    曹欣
    作剧：黄悌
    导演：吴雪
    中国青年艺术剧院演出
    我以兴奋和喜悦的心情看了中国青年艺术剧院演出的四幕六场话剧“钢铁运输兵”。我国文艺工作者曾经尽了很大努力，运用通讯、小说、诗歌等文艺形式，歌颂了抗美援朝的英雄业迹；但以中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争为题材的话剧还不多。这就使我们更加重视这个剧的上演。剧作者黄悌和青年艺术剧院全体演员同志们，深入战地，在战斗生活里比较深切地体会了志愿军的先进思想和旺盛的战斗热情，从而创造了志愿军的动人的英雄形象，使一九五一年秋季朝、中人民部队粉碎范佛里特的“秋季攻势”的事迹，活现在舞台上，给予观众以深刻的印象和有力的鼓舞。
    一九五一年秋季，我军正处在五次胜利战役后最困难的时期。朝鲜三十年来所没有过的洪水，把桥梁、道路大部都冲坏了，供应十分困难。敌人就在这一时期向我军发动了“秋季攻势”，并集中力量对北朝鲜广大后方的咽喉地区进行所谓“绞杀战”，用尽了破坏我交通干线的种种毒辣手段。“秋季攻势”前后敌机出动的次数和投弹量比一九五一年一月增加到三、四十倍，敌人企图用狂轰滥炸来割断我们的运输线。在这样的情况下，我们运输线上的后勤工作人员、铁道兵团、朝鲜民工、火车和汽车司机员、装卸员、仓库管理人员以及防空部队，英勇地担负起与疯狂的美国空中强盗、风雨和洪水作斗争的艰苦而复杂的任务。他们想尽了一切办法，用自己的劳动、勇敢和智慧，保卫着每一条运输线，使我们的运输量不但没有减少，反而一天比一天增加。
    “钢铁运输兵”描写了运输线上的一个兵种——志愿军汽车司机员的英勇事迹。某汽车团的一个连队奉命抢运炮弹，支援前线部队反击向天德山、月夜山进攻的敌人。汽车连在行进途中被敌机炸断的江桥所阻拦，通后方的公路也被另一辆满装弹药、被敌机击中而爆炸的车辆所切断。接近江桥的另一部分折回来隐蔽的车辆和停在路上的车辆拥挤在一起。敌机又在上空低飞盘旋，并已开始投掷照明弹。情况是十分紧急的。假如暴露了目标，所有堵塞着的数十台车辆必然会遭到严重的损失，就会严重地影响前线的战争。就在这个时候，剧中的主角高克英挺身而出，建议由自己驾空车从人行小道冲出去，以灯光引开敌机，争取时间疏散车辆和抢修江桥。在指挥员的同意下，高克英完成了这艰险的任务，使全部车辆脱离了险境，顺利地把炮弹送到了前线。作者通过相互连接的几个故事，生动地反映了志愿军汽车司机员勇敢地机智地与敌人在运输线上进行复杂而艰苦的斗争；表现了他们热爱祖国、热爱朝鲜人民的高贵品质和他们对战争负责、对胜利负责的高度责任感。舞台上的情节和人物形象使观众受到了国际主义、爱国主义和革命英雄主义的生动的教育。
    剧中的主角高克英是一个机智、勇敢的青年战士。他热爱祖国、热爱朝鲜人民、热爱朝鲜的每一个儿童。他把自己对祖国的热爱和对朝鲜人民的同情化为战斗的力量。在日常工作中，他以高度的毅力，忍受着艰苦，坚守着自己的岗位；他不停地帮助同志们拉车、修车；他诚恳而亲切地用各种方式去教育和鼓励周围的同志；他时刻关心着战争的胜利。在情况万分紧急的时候，他不惜冒着生命的危险去引开敌机，使全连车辆转危为安。这种革命英雄主义的高贵行为，深深地感动了观众。
      “钢铁运输兵”反映了中、朝人民牢不可破的战斗的团结。金老大娘亲切地照顾我们每一个志愿军战士，就像照顾自己的子女一样。金大嫂离开了年老的婆婆和幼女小英子，带领着民工队和志愿军工兵们一起，日日夜夜地抢修公路和桥梁，支援战争。当她听到自己的幼女发生了意外的不幸，又看到了受伤的高克英的时候，她压住心头的焦急和痛苦，细心地救护着志愿军战士高克英。这是完全可以理解的。中朝人民患难与共，团结得像一家人一样。志愿军的每一个战士也把朝鲜人民的苦难当作自己的苦难。在剧本第二幕的末尾，高克英以钢铁般的坚强有力的声音喊出自己的决心：“天塌地陷也挡不住咱！”美国玩具炸弹杀死了朝鲜孩子小贞子和炸瞎了小英子的血腥暴行撕裂了高克英的心，金大嫂一家人的遭遇使我们深刻地体会到朝鲜人民忍受了多么深沉的苦痛！她们按住了自己的创伤，挺起了胸膛，顽强不屈地与敌人斗争着，保卫着自己的祖国，保卫着远东和世界和平。就在这种爱国主义和国际主义的思想感情的基础上，在抗击共同敌人的革命斗争中，建立了中、朝两国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊。
    “钢铁运输兵”反映了志愿军英雄司机员在“头顶敌机，脚蹬定时弹”的艰苦斗争中所表现的高度的革命乐观主义的精神。这种乐观主义精神渗透在全剧的细节里。作者刻划了一群忠心耿耿为人民服务、不计较个人得失的英勇的志愿军战士。他们摸熟了与敌人作斗争的规律，有了充分的斗争经验和胜利信心。这就使得他们在任何困难的处境中都充满了镇定、愉快和乐观的情绪。
    自然，剧本“钢铁运输兵”还是有缺点的，在某些地方给人以不够真实的感觉。例如在第二幕中，作者过分强调了敌机的盘旋轰炸是为了丢掉炸弹好回去“交差”。这就把敌人描写得太无用了，因而减弱了我们对敌人斗争的艰苦性和我们取得胜利的意义。假如作者能更加强对艰苦情景的描写，那就更切合当时的实际情况，也更能表现志愿军坚强不屈的英雄气魄和伟大的革命精神。
    尽管有缺点，这个剧本基本上是好的，能给人以健康的思想教育。中国青年艺术剧院的同志们以极大的努力，把这个戏搬上了舞台，这是很有意义的工作。
