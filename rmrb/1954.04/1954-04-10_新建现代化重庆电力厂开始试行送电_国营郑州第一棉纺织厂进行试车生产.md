Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 9th: The newly built, modern Chongqing Power Plant began trial power transmission at 11:05 AM on April 7th. Powerful current, via the high-voltage transmission lines between the power plant and the Chongqing city center substation, began to be transmitted to various factories and enterprises in need of electricity. When the red light illuminated, signifying the transmission of current from the high-voltage lines, enthusiastic applause erupted from the crowd. Soviet experts, workers, and technicians tightly shook hands, celebrating the success of the new power plant's trial power transmission.

Hundreds of thousands of workers and students in Chongqing are thrilled about the impending formal power generation of the new power plant, with some sending congratulatory letters to the newly built power plant even before the official launch. All the staff of Sichuan Cement Factory wrote, saying, "We are very happy that you are about to generate electricity. In the future, we can produce more cement to support the country's basic construction." Second-year students majoring in power plants, power distribution networks, and combined transmission systems at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Chongqing University, also wrote as future industrial builders to congratulate this new victory of the country's industrialization.

To meet the eager expectations of the people of Chongqing for this new power plant, workers installing the turbine generator units have been working day and night in tense effort, finally completing the final installation work on April 5th. On the same day, the Start-up Committee Headquarters ordered the operating personnel of each section to conduct a thorough inspection of the equipment participating in the operation, preparing to start at any time. The Chongqing Electricity Bureau also recently connected the second high-voltage transmission line between the new Chongqing Power Plant and the central substation to ensure the reliability of power transmission. The electrical sub-station directly responsible for power transmission has spent nearly a month revising and studying various regulations and systems based on the opinions of Soviet experts, and carrying out equipment inspection and maintenance. After this trial power transmission, it is expected that after a few more days of full-load trial operation, some of the plant's units and boilers can be formally energized.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 9th: The construction project of the new state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has been basically completed and has begun trial production. After nearly a month of trial operation in March, the quality and production efficiency of the complete set of domestically produced textile machines have been proven to be very good. For the fine spinning frames producing 23-count yarn, the average output per thousand spindles per hour is 45.15 pounds, and the quality of the yarn reaches Grade A. The average output of the looms reaches 4 yards per hour, and the density, length, and width of the cloth all meet the standards. Such output is already close to the average production level of textile factories in the Northwest region. The factory director, chief engineer, and workshop technical cadres transferred from textile factories in Shanghai and Wuhan, who are observing the production situation in the workshop every day, all believe that such production results from the trial operation of the new machines are rare in the history of China's textile industry, which indicates the progress of China's textile machinery manufacturing level.

In addition to the part of the machines that have already been started, most of the remaining machines in Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have also been installed, and are undergoing final inspection and calibration. It is expected that all machines can be started by May. According to the national plan, this factory will produce tens of thousands of cotton yarns this year. If these yarns are completely woven into fabrics, they can supply more than 4 million people with one set of clothes each.

    新建现代化重庆电力厂开始试行送电
    国营郑州第一棉纺织厂进行试车生产
    【新华社重庆九日电】新建现代化的重庆电力厂已在四月七日上午十一点五分开始试行送电。强大的电流，经由电厂和重庆市中心变电站之间的高压输电线，开始输送到需要电力的各个工厂企业中去了。当红灯一亮，电流从高压线输送出去的时候，人群中响起了热烈的掌声，苏联专家、工人和技术人员们紧紧地互相握手，庆贺新电厂试行送电的成功。
    重庆市几十万工人和学生都为新电厂即将正式发电感到欢欣鼓舞，有的等不到发电就写信向这个新建电力厂致贺了。四川水泥厂的全体职工写信说，你们将要发电了，我们很高兴，今后我们可以生产更多的水泥来支援国家的基本建设了。重庆大学机电系的发电厂、配电网和联合输电系统等专业的二年级生，也以未来工业建设者的身份，写信祝贺这一国家工业化的新的胜利。
    为了满足重庆人民对这个新建电力厂的殷切期望，几日来安装汽轮机组的工人夜以继日地紧张工作着，终于在四月五日完成了最后的安装工作。同日启动委员会指挥部下令各部分的运行人员对参加运转的设备进行一次彻底的检查，准备随时启动。重庆电业局也在不久以前接通重庆新建电力厂和中心变电站之间的第二条高压输电线，以保证送电的可靠性。直接负责送电的电气分场，近一个月来根据苏联专家的意见修改和学习了各种规程制度，进行了设备的检查和修理。这次试行送电以后，预计再经过几天的满负荷试车，这个电力厂的部分机炉就可以正式送电了。
    【新华社郑州九日电】新建国营郑州第一棉纺织厂建厂工程基本完成，已进行试车生产。这个纺织厂经过三月份将近一个月的试车，全套国产纺织机器的质量和生产效能都证明是很好的。细纱机纺二十三支纱，平均每千个锭子每小时的产量为四十五点一五磅，纱的质量达到甲等。织布机的产量平均每一台每小时达到四码，布的密度、长度、宽度都符合标准。这样的产量已接近目前西北地区纺织工厂的平均生产水平。每天在车间里察看生产情况的厂长、总工程师和从上海、武汉的纺织工厂调来的车间技术干部们，都认为新机器开始试车得到这样的生产成绩，在我国纺织工业历史上是少有的，这表明了我国纺织机械制造水平的进步。
    郑州第一棉纺织厂除了现已开动的一部分机器外，其余的机器大部分也已安装好，正在进行最后的检修和校正，预计到五月份就可以全部开车。根据国家计划，这个厂今年要生产出一万几千件棉纱。这些纱如果完全织成布匹，可以供给四百多万人每人各做一套衣服。
