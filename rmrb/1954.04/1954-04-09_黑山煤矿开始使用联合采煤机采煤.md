    Heishan Coal Mine Begins Using Combined Coal Mining Machine
    The Heishan Coal Mine of the Zibo Mining Bureau in Shandong Province began test-using a Donbass-1 combined coal mining machine in the Sanli Shaft in late February. Now this mining machine has been officially put into production.
    The Donbass-1 combined coal mining machine is produced in the Donbass mining area of ​​Ukraine, Soviet Union. It is seven meters long and weighs seven tons. Its original minimum efficiency was 50 tons of coal per hour. As long as a worker controls the switch, the cutter on the machine touches the coal seam, and the coal is cut off in large pieces. The crushing bar on the machine automatically crushes the coal, and then the loading machine automatically sends the coal blocks to the coal chute for transportation. The whole process is mechanized. Due to the irregular thickness of the coal seam in the Heishan Coal Mine, the uneven roof, and the workers' unskilled operation skills, this mining machine can only mine about 250 tons of coal per day, which is only half of the machine's minimum efficiency, but this has replaced the work of 130 people.
    In early February, when this combined coal mining machine was transported to the Heishan Coal Mine, the workers were very happy, as if they had encountered a great happy event. They told each other, and after get off work, they couldn't wait to change clothes or take a bath, so they rushed to see the combined coal mining machine first. They looked at it again and again, touched it again and again, and were reluctant to leave. Worker Han Changshan said emotionally: "In the old society, coal miners were worse than cattle and horses. After liberation, our working conditions have been improving day by day, and our lives have also been improving day by day. This time, our Soviet elder brother has sent us a combined coal mining machine, so that the heavy work can be replaced by machines, reducing the physical labor of the workers. From this incident, we have a clearer understanding of the benefits of socialism."
    The coal cutting device of this combined coal mining machine was originally on the right, while the coal mining face of the Sanli Shaft of the Heishan Coal Mine was on the left, so it had to be modified. Engineers sent by the Zibo Mining Bureau, technicians from the Heishan Coal Mine, and combined coal mining machine drivers who had interned at the Datong Coal Mine actively carried out the dismantling, washing and modification work. They carefully compared the instructions, overcame many difficulties, and finally successfully modified it in more than ten days. When starting the test run underground, the machine often stopped because the workers were not skilled in operating, the natural conditions on site changed a lot, and the supply of cars and the movement of the chute could not keep up. But with the workers' enthusiastic study, these difficulties were finally overcome. Now this combined coal mining machine has been officially put into production. The drivers are actively learning technology, preparing to better master this machine and make it play a higher efficiency.

### 黑山煤矿开始使用联合采煤机采煤

    黑山煤矿开始使用联合采煤机采煤
    山东省淄博矿务局黑山煤矿从二月下旬开始在三立井试用顿巴斯—一型联合采煤机采煤，现在这部采煤机已正式投入生产。
    顿巴斯—一型联合采煤机是苏联乌克兰顿巴斯矿区的出品，机长七公尺，机重七吨。它原来的最低效率是每小时采煤五十吨。只要一个工人管着开关，机器上的截刀一碰到煤层，煤就被一大块一大块地割下来，机器上的破碎杠又自动把煤打碎，然后装煤机又自动地把煤块送到煤溜子里运出去，这全部过程都是机械化的。由于黑山煤矿的煤层厚薄不规律，顶板不平，工人的操作技术还不熟练，现在这部采煤机每天还只能采煤二百五十吨左右，仅发挥了机器最低效率的一半，但是这样已代替了一百三十个人的工作。
    二月初，这部联合采煤机运到黑山煤矿的时候，工人都非常高兴，像遇到大喜事一样，互相传告，下班后顾不得换衣服、洗澡，就先跑去看联合采煤机。他们看了又看，摸了又摸，舍不得离开。工人韩长山感动地说：“过去在旧社会里，煤矿工人比牛马还不如。解放后，咱们的劳动条件一天天地改善，生活也随着一天天地提高。这回苏联老大哥又给咱们送来联合采煤机，笨重的活让机器来代替，减轻了工人的体力劳动。从这件事情上，咱们更清楚地体会到了社会主义的好处。”
    这部联合采煤机的割煤装置原来是在右面，而黑山煤矿三立井的采煤面是在左面，因此必须进行改装。由淄博矿务局派来的工程师、黑山煤矿的技术人员和曾经到大同煤矿实习过的联合采煤机司机就积极进行拆洗改装工作。他们仔细地对照着说明书，克服了很多困难，花了十多天的时间终于改装成功。开始在井下试车时，由于工人操作技术不熟练，现场的自然条件变化多，车皮的供应及移溜子等工作跟不上，常常停车。但在工人热情的钻研下，终于克服了这些困难。现在这部联合采煤机已正式投入生产。司机们正积极学习技术，准备更好地掌握这部机器，使它发挥更高的效能。
