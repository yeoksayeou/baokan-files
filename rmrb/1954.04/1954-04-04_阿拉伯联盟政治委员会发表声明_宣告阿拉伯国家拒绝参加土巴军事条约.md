Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 3rd: According to TASS, the twenty-first session of the Arab League Council opened in Cairo on March 31st. Egypt and Syria sent their foreign ministers to participate in the meeting. Lebanon was represented by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other countries were represented by their ambassadors to Egypt.

According to newspaper reports, during the meeting of the League's Political Committee on April 1st, the representatives of various countries spoke out, condemning the Western countries' attempts to draw Arab countries into military blocs. The Political Committee issued a statement declaring that the Arab states refused to participate in the Pakistan-Turkey military treaty and "resolutely insisted that all member states of the League adhere to the League's charter."

According to the League's charter, member states of the League are prohibited from participating in any alliances and organizations that are detrimental to Arab countries.

The statement of the Political Committee emphasized that the Arab countries will strive to defend their independence and "will never undertake any obligations that would harm their complete sovereignty and independence."

The twenty-first session of the Arab League Council was originally scheduled to be held in Baghdad, but the Iraqi government temporarily requested the Arab League Secretariat to hold the meeting in another capital, citing the floods in Iraq due to the flooding of the Tigris River.

Egyptian newspapers pointed out that this was not the real reason for the Iraqi government's opposition to holding the meeting in Baghdad. Many countries intended to raise the issue of the Turko-Pakistani military treaty, which was unpopular with Arab countries, at the meeting, and the Iraqi government feared that such actions would have an adverse impact domestically when the Iraqi government was considering joining the treaty.

The "Republic" wrote that the Iraqi government had sent a letter to the member states of the Arab League, requesting them not to raise the issue of the Turko-Pakistani treaty at the Council meeting. It is reported that the Arab countries did not agree and decided to hold the meeting in Cairo.

    阿拉伯联盟政治委员会发表声明
    宣告阿拉伯国家拒绝参加土巴军事条约
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社开罗讯：阿拉伯联盟理事会第二十一届会议于三月三十一日在开罗开幕。埃及和叙利亚派了它们的外交部长参加会议，黎巴嫩的代表是外交部秘书长，其他国家都由它们驻埃及的大使为代表出席。
    据报纸消息，在四月一日联盟的政治委员会举行会议的时候，各国代表发言谴责西方国家拉阿拉伯国家参加军事集团的企图。政治委员会发表声明，宣告阿拉伯国家拒绝参加巴基斯坦—土耳其军事条约，并“坚决主张联盟的全体成员国忠于联盟的宪章”。
    按联盟的宪章禁止联盟的成员国参加不利于阿拉伯国家的一切同盟和组织。
    政治委员会的声明强调指出：阿拉伯国家将努力奋斗，保卫它们的独立，并且“决不承担任何会损害它们的完整主权和独立的义务”。
    阿拉伯联盟理事会第二十一届会议原定在巴格达举行，但是伊拉克政府临时要求阿拉伯联盟秘书处在另一个首都举行这次会议，理由是由于底格里斯河泛滥，伊拉克发生了水灾。
    埃及各报指出，这并不是伊拉克政府反对会议在巴格达举行的真正理由。许多国家打算在会上提出不受阿拉伯国家欢迎的土巴军事条约问题，而伊拉克政府害怕当伊拉克政府正在考虑要参加这个条约时，这种行动将在国内发生不利的影响。
    “共和国报”写道，伊拉克政府曾致函阿拉伯联盟的会员国，要求它们不要在理事会的会议上提出土巴条约问题。据悉，阿拉伯国家没有答应，并决定在开罗举行会议。
