Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 4th: More than forty state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in Chongqing have criticized complacency and conservative thinking, and have set more advanced production plans for the second quarter. The majority of factories and mines have set their various planned targets for the second quarter to exceed the actual production levels of the fourth quarter of last year and the planned targets for the first quarter. The planned pig iron output of Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant for the second quarter has increased by 46.52 percent compared to the estimated completion figure for the first quarter. The planned electric furnace steel output of No. 102 Steel Plant for the second quarter has increased by more than 38 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and labor productivity has increased by 18.7 percent. No. 104 Steel Plant, which produces a large number of heavy rail accessories, plans to increase its total output value in the second quarter by more than 53 percent compared to the first quarter of this year. Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory, Chongqing Machine Tool Factory, Chongqing General Machinery Factory, and various coal mines have also raised their production targets and set relatively advanced production plans. After criticizing the idea of waiting for the mechanization of the production process before increasing output, the state-owned Nantong Coal Mine raised its planned targets on the basis of promoting advanced experience, tapping the potential of the enterprise, and mobilizing the masses to create advanced production targets. The output of bituminous coal in the second quarter will increase by 6 percent compared to the first quarter, and metallurgical coke will increase by 35 percent. Many factories and mines will also further improve product quality and reduce costs in the second quarter.

Many factories and mines have already formulated technical measures plans in accordance with the requirements of the second quarter production plan. No. 101 Steel Plant will promote advanced ironmaking methods such as "furnace top adjustment" and "steam blowing" in the second quarter to increase pig iron output. State-owned Nantong Coal Mine plans to promote advanced tunneling experience such as "directional blasting" and "deep-hole operation" to increase tunneling rate and increase coal production. Twenty-two locally state-owned factories have established full-time inspection agencies, implemented technical records and technical responsibility systems to improve product quality.

Chongqing State-owned No. 610 Textile Factory will save the country more than 1.21 billion yuan in the second quarter by saving raw materials, improving technology, and disposing of sluggish materials. Steel mills and textile factories have begun to implement summer cooling measures in advance to ensure safe production.

The production plans of many factories and mines in Chongqing in the first quarter of this year were relatively conservative, and although the production plans for the first quarter were completed well, they were lower than the actual level of the fourth quarter of last year. Based on this situation, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Southwest Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government convened relevant factory and mine leading cadre meetings in March to examine the production planning and production situation of various factories and mines. At the meeting, responsible cadres of various factories and mines criticized complacency and conservative thinking, and, in accordance with the spirit of the meeting, mobilized employees to discuss the plan, further explored potential capabilities, and formulated a relatively advanced second quarter plan.

    重庆四十多个厂矿提高第二季度生产指标
    【新华社重庆四日电】重庆市四十多个国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿批判了自满情绪和保守思想，订出了比较先进的第二季度生产计划。多数厂矿第二季度的各项计划指标，都超过了去年第四季度的实际生产水平和第一季度的计划指标。重庆国营一零一钢铁厂第二季度的生铁计划产量比第一季度预计完成的数字增加了百分之四十六点五二。一零二钢铁厂第二季度的电炉钢计划产量比去年第四季度增加百分之三十八以上，劳动生产率提高百分之十八点七。大量生产重轨配件的一零四钢铁厂，第二季度计划总产值比今年第一季度增加百分之五十三以上。重庆空气压缩机厂、重庆柴油机厂、重庆机床厂、重庆通用机器厂和各煤矿也都提高了生产指标，订出了比较先进的生产计划。国营南桐煤矿批判了等待生产过程机械化以后再提高产量的思想以后，在推广先进经验、挖掘企业潜力、发动群众创造先进生产指标的基础上，提高了计划指标。第二季度烟煤产量将比第一季度提高百分之六，冶金焦将提高百分之三十五。许多厂矿还将在第二季度进一步提高产品质量和降低成本。
    许多厂矿已经根据第二季度生产计划的要求，编制了技术措施计划。一零一钢铁厂将在第二季度推行“炉顶调剂”、“蒸气鼓风”等先进炼铁方法，提高生铁的产量。国营南桐煤矿准备推广“定向爆破”、“深孔作业”等先进掘进经验，提高掘进率，增加煤产量。已有二十二个地方国营工厂建立了专职检验机构，实行了技术记录和技术专责制，提高产品质量。
    重庆国营六一零纺织厂将通过节约原材料、改进技术、处理呆滞材料等方法，在第二季度给国家节约十二亿一千多万元。各钢铁厂、纺织厂已提前开始进行夏季降温工作，保证安全生产。
    重庆市许多厂矿今年第一季度的生产计划订得比较保守，第一季度的生产计划完成得虽然不错，但却低于去年第四季度的实际水平。中共重庆市委员会、中央人民政府第一机械工业部西南办事处根据这个情况，曾在三月份分别召开了有关的厂矿负责干部会议，检查各厂矿制订生产计划的情况和生产情况。各厂矿负责干部在会上批判了自满情绪和保守思想，并根据会议精神发动职工讨论计划，进一步发掘了潜在能力，订出了比较先进的第二季度计划。
