Editor's Note: The article "In a Meeting..." profoundly exposes bureaucratic leadership styles. Bureaucracy like holding lengthy meetings, reading reports aloud, without going deep into the masses, understanding the situation, and solving problems is not uncommon in our country. We are reprinting this article to arouse everyone's vigilance in order to further overcome bureaucracy and improve our leadership work.
    
    In a Meeting…
    Soviet Union　Walentin Oweczkin
    
    The district's Party activists' congress was held at the cultural palace.
    
    The summary of the recently held plenary session of the state committee was reported by Rudenko, chairman of the district executive committee. Because Comrade Martynov, the first secretary of the district committee, had a cold and a hoarse voice, with a woolen scarf around his neck, he could not speak loudly. Comrade Medvedev, the second secretary of the district committee, was on vacation.
    
    To be honest, this report was not "made," it was read, and such a report could be entrusted to anyone to read, even to the technical secretary, as long as they had a loud voice. Or, to save time, it could be omitted entirely - just print hundreds of copies in advance and distribute them to all participants.
    
    The plenary session of the state committee discussed two issues: the situation of mass education work in collective farms and measures to improve and develop animal husbandry. Rudenko also reported the resolution of the plenary session of the state committee. He monotonously read for an hour and a half; he did not deviate from the manuscript drafted by the district committee and district executive committee staff for even a minute, nor did he raise his head to look at the hall in front of him. Some people in the audience were dozing off, some were whispering to their neighbors, and those sitting in the back rows were secretly smoking into their sleeves.
    
    Martynov sat on the rostrum, looking annoyed, nervously fiddling with a pencil, frowning, and looking at Rudenko with malicious eyes.
    
    No one asked the reporter any questions. Only two people signed up to speak in the discussion.
    
    The first speaker was Nikolenko, a district committee instructor. He used all of his allotted ten minutes to list the shortcomings in the work of the Party organizations of the collective farms he was responsible for: no Party member congress had been held for three months, there were fewer and fewer propagandists, no wall newspapers were published, and Communist Party members were drinking heavily during the local guardian saint festival. It seemed that his task was limited to this: running from one collective farm to another, carefully noting all the "faults," and then "reflecting" them to the members of the district committee standing committee. His speech did not improve Martynov's mood.
    
    After Nikolenko spoke, Goncharova, a female collective farm member who had joined the Party in 1939 and was the head of a pig farm, spoke.
    
    The lights in the hall were turned off, although the meeting was held during the day, the area behind the table on the rostrum was somewhat dark: because very little light came in from the frozen, snow-covered windows. The female collective farm member stuttered distressfully, reading her speech word by word.
    
    "Our achievements... are the result of... tenacious... labor and a high level of conscious attitude. In terms of nurturing piglets... we pay close attention... piglet production takes place in clean... disinfected... places... using rich and varied... feeds to feed the pigs... and piglets, creating good conditions for them, we are able to obtain healthy and vigorous piglets from... the sows... Now we set ourselves... the task... of increasing... the income of animal husbandry in this way..."
    
    Even in the parts of the speech that should have been delivered with enthusiasm, she stuttered.
    
    "A lively... lively... competition has unfolded, we guarantee to..."
    
    Near the end, she mixed up the pages of her manuscript, panicked, and became at a loss; so, one sentence was only half-spoken, and she walked off the stage.
    
    Those sitting on the rostrum lowered their heads out of shame and embarrassment.
    
    Martynov stood up to announce a break.
    
    He asked in his hoarse voice, damaged by a cold: "Is the Party branch secretary of the 'Friendship' collective farm here?"
    
    "I am," a man in a military officer's coat without epaulets stood up from the back rows.
    
    "Comrade Mostovoi, did you draft the speech for her?"
    
    "I... and the collective farm chairman."
    
    "You put a lot of effort into it!... One of the best livestock breeders in the district, whose ability is enough to make the pig farm a model pig farm, are you afraid she's not capable enough to talk about her own work without your crib sheet?... Comrade Goncharova, don't be embarrassed because you didn't speak well. The shame is not yours, but ours... Before I announce the break, comrades," Martynov glanced at the state committee instructor sitting on the rostrum, foreseeing a quarrel with him. He had long had disagreements with Golubkov, the instructor who frequently came to the district. "Let's agree on this: if anyone has nothing worth saying, then it's best not to speak here, and don't waste your own time and everyone else's. We don't need to report on activism with ‘a certain percentage of those attending the meeting spoke.’ But what was discussed, and why? Nikolenko just reread a report that we already saw three days ago. Party activists are gathered together to seriously discuss issues, not to give speeches for the sake of giving speeches. I now declare a fifteen-minute break."
    
    People did not immediately go out to smoke, everyone was a little bewildered.
    
    Golubkov grabbed Martynov on the stage and said:
    
    "What's wrong with you, Pyotr Illarionovich, are you feeling unwell? Do you have a fever? You'd better go home and lie in bed. There are other members of the Standing Committee here, the meeting can proceed without you. Are you trying to attack Party activists? ‘If you can't speak well—don't speak at all.’"
    
    "That's not what I meant, Comrade Golubkov!"
    
    "Are you holding a meeting with professors or what? Half of the people in this room are collective farmers, why are you scaring them? This Goncharova—she has a low level of education! We should help her!"
    
    "My words are not directed at those with a low level of education," Martynov retorted, "but at those with a very high level of education! I am speaking to those whose tongues have calluses from such meetings!"
    
    "I don't understand," Golubkov shrugged, "I don't know what's going on with your Party activists. Watch out, I hope Rudenko doesn't feel compelled to give the closing remarks immediately after the break."
    
    "Maybe he'll have to... For you, Nikolai Arkhipovich, this is certainly very unpleasant. This is a special event in the district you are responsible for! The Party activists' congress has failed! Only two people spoke. How can you report this to the state committee? Especially since you yourself attended the meeting."
    
    "I don't think this is very pleasant for you either."
    
    Rudenko came over. Martynov said:
    
    "Damn it, your report is like saying smoking is bad for your health!"
    
    "Pyotr Illarionovich!" Rudenko grabbed his shoulder and said, "Because I didn't have time to prepare!"
    
    "You've been working in this district for five years. You know the people, and you are good at talking to them! But you just repeated the resolution of the state committee. But you didn't say what everyone has already seen! But your own opinions - there weren't any!... If the report is like this, then the discussion will certainly be like this!"
    
    "My words have dried up. I've been in meetings for five days! I thought you would give the report, but you were going to be sick."
    
    After the break, despite Martynov's warning, the first speaker was precisely the kind of person whose tongue had calluses. This was Korobkin, the head of the rural construction department of the district executive committee. No meeting in the district was complete without Korobkin's fiery speech.
    
    Korobkin was thin and tall, wearing a long black overcoat, with a high forehead (due to baldness), and his hands waving majestically on the lectern, as if shouting slogans to hundreds of thousands of people in the square, shouting each word distinctly. The glass of the chandelier hanging from the ceiling rattled from the sound of his voice.
    
    "Comrades! Fodder - is the foundation of animal husbandry! But some comrades resolutely refuse to understand this point, and very wrongly underestimate the preparation of fodder for animal husbandry!..."
    
    "Cows, comrades, cows are working livestock! Working livestock needs to be protected!..."
    
    "Comrades, pigs can provide us with meat, oil, leather, and bristles! Pigs are very useful animals! But how do we treat pigs?"
    
    "Comrades, livestock needs warm, well-built sheds. Comrades, cows produce more milk in warm, clean places than in cold, dirty places! But some collective farm chairmen, comrades, do not pay attention to building cowsheds!..."
    
    "Speaking of mass political work for collective farmers, I must be very frank, comrades, we are not doing our work well for collective farmers!..."
    
    "Comrades, wall newspapers, these are newspapers! And newspapers are the sharpest weapon of our Party! But, does every collective farm have a wall newspaper? No, comrades, not every collective farm has a wall newspaper!..."
    
    Martynov frowned as if suffering from a severe headache.
    
    He whispered to Rudenko, who was sitting next to him: "It takes skill to say something for ten minutes without saying a single useful thing!..."
    
    There was a commotion in the hall:
    
    "Comrade Korobkin, what is the purpose of your speech?"
    
    "What use are you to us?"
    
    "Saying that pigs can provide oil?"
    
    "And dairy cows can supply milk?"
    
    "Please say something serious, don't waste our time!"
    
    Martynov tapped the table with a pencil.
    
    "Who will speak next?..."
    
    An unbearable silence lasted for about five minutes. No one requested to speak. It seemed that the meeting could really only end here. Golubkov angrily looked at Martynov, pushed his chair back with a squeak, and stood up to go behind the stage to smoke. Obviously, even Martynov felt uncomfortable at this time... But suddenly a hand was raised in the hall, two hands, three hands. Five people all requested to speak at the same time.
    
    ...Demyan Vasilyevich Opinkin, the chairman of the "Soviet Regime" collective farm, walked toward the club's stage, heavily treading the steps up to the table on the rostrum. He unhurriedly took off his coat, took out his glasses and notebook from his coat pocket, wiped his glasses with the hem of his coat, opened the notebook, and coughed twice.
    
    "Comrades, this is not my speech outline," Opinkin began to say, "this is the diary of a collective farm chairman. That is, my personal diary. I write down every day where I was and what I did. If someone ever accuses me of messing up the work - this is my defense. The inspector will understand after reading it and will sympathize with me. He will say: ‘Comrade Opinkin, I’m surprised you even have time to do some work on the collective farm!’"
    
    Opinkin continued to speak to the attentive listening of the entire hall, flipping through the notebook:
    
    "Let's calculate how many meetings I have attended in half a month, and calculate how many more I will have to attend by the end of the month?... The state committee plenary session was held on the 2nd. I am a member of the state committee. I was called, so I went. It lasted two days. Then they asked the representatives of the state soviet to stay for a meeting. So I stayed. Another two days. Running here and there - a whole week away from home. Then, to here, to the district: district committee plenary session, district soviet meeting, today is the Party activists meeting. In short, I spent a total of two days on the collective farm in half a month. But it's not just that. The day after tomorrow is our village soviet meeting, I have to report on the summary of the state soviet meeting. On the 20th, we plan to hold a collective farm Party member congress, also to discuss the summary of the state committee plenary session. Comrades, now let's calculate how many times a month the collective farm chairman is called to the standing committee or the executive committee. When I get there - there are all kinds of committees. I don't have time to work at home! At the same time, all the meetings are discussing: how to improve work, how to improve this, and strengthen that. But if all our time is spent talking, when do we improve and strengthen?... Party member congresses - are not public, plenary sessions are of course secret, the Party activists meetings are as well, and the soviet meetings are only attended by representatives. But the meetings are talking about how to do work with the masses. We are locked in rooms, convincing each other that we should lead the people's work better!... There are twenty meetings a month - the work is really intense! But all the meetings are not public, we just encourage ourselves! At the same time, some collective farms only hold a general meeting of all members once a year, just to make a work summary report!..."
    
    Opinkin usually rarely spoke at Party committee plenary sessions and activists meetings, but this time he did:
    
    "Comrades, I am not against sitting in this hall for an hour or two. For example, listening to a good report, listening to a speech on the international situation, etc. Let the knowledgeable people talk to us about things that we haven't had time to read or wouldn't deeply study ourselves. They tell us - and then we pass it on to others. But Comrade Korobkin is here proving to us that pigs are useful livestock... This is intolerable! It should be admitted that a lot of this is also heard at the state meetings. A person goes to the podium and talks endlessly! Then think about it: what did he say? Nothing! All just words like: ‘Mobilize forces!’, ‘Elevate it to a high level!’ The chairman doesn't stop it either. Everyone shouts ‘Enough!’, ‘The speaking time limit has been reached!’ - but he still talks on and on. As if he is getting paid for every word. And we sit there thinking: who will pay for our time? Five hundred people are sitting here, how much time are you wasting from us! Calculate how many work hours that is! If a driver runs an empty car, the public security bureau fines them, calculated by ton-kilometers. This is work time. It is also of considerable value! But no one fines these people who waste time!..."
    
    Opinkin walked down amid approving laughter and applause from the entire hall.
    
    The people who spoke after Opinkin - there were about ten more speakers, so if you look at it according to "numerical indicators," the Party activists congress was "up to standard" - almost all talked about the harm of too many meetings, tall talk, and discussing behind closed doors issues that need to be solved with the masses.
    
    Posokhov, the editor-in-chief of the district newspaper, who was sitting behind Martynov on the rostrum, leaned over from the back of his chair and said to him with a smile:
    
    "How terrible the power of inertia is, Pyotr Illarionovich! Look, you brought up a topic of discussion: the harm of empty talk, and so many people are talking about this issue, repeating each other!... ‘We need to hold another meeting about eliminating all kinds of meetings!’"
    
    Reshkov, the secretary of the district youth league committee, spoke, saying:
    
    "In ancient Sparta, if a person could say in two or three sentences what others could not explain clearly in an hour, it was considered a heroic thing. Should we also restore this tradition of Sparta?"
    
    Someone in the hall retorted to him:
    
    "You yourself are not following the rules, you have already spoken for thirteen minutes!"
    
    Mostovoi, the Party branch secretary of the "Friendship" collective farm, spoke. This was the person who wrote the speech for Goncharova, the head of the pig farm. He reasonably and factually blamed the bureaucratic leadership methods of the staff of the district committee.
    
    "The district committee instructor comes to our grassroots organization. What does he check, what is he interested in? It's when the Party member congress was held, what issues were discussed. And then: how many people spoke, is there enough enthusiasm. Then, he looks at the resolution to see if it's written smoothly. He asks about the work plan - what is planned to be read in the work team, what kind of discussions will be held, whether they have been held. But he is not at all interested in what changes have occurred in our lives after these meetings! For example, a work team held a discussion on the resolution of the plenary session. How is the work of the work team after the meeting? Are the collective farmers working better? Maybe new Stakhanovite workers have emerged in this team? Is the competition more heated? If there is no improvement, then, comrades, how did you conduct the discussion? This means that it has not touched people's hearts! Then let's talk to people together again, I'll help you! This is what is needed. But that's not how it's done there. Documents, just documents!... Someone says: It doesn't matter if you can't work - you need to learn to report fluently, and a written report will solve everything! District committee comrades, you yourselves have made us like this! And you, Comrade Martynov, obviously, completely ignore your instructors. You manage the affairs of the collective farm directly, without going through them. You want everything in the collective farm to be in order, but so far, you haven't straightened out the work of your own organization! Under your nose, in the district committee, there is both bureaucracy and red tape, everything that you scold us for!..."
    
    Martynov scratched the back of his head. The facts are still facts. His hand just "didn't reach" the nearest place. He had never convened a meeting of instructors, had not talked with them heart-to-heart, and had not practically taught them with lively Party work methods. The district committee secretaries' attitude toward the staff was still old, according to habit - like ordinary "plenipotentiaries," sending them to the collective farm was the simplest and most convenient, because they were always at hand...
    
    Goncharova spoke again, no longer holding a manuscript. This woman concentrated her thoughts and simply and interestingly told why her pig farm had become a model pig farm. She said how they moved the houses of all the staff of the pig farm from the village ten kilometers away, formed a new village, where people settled down, opened gardens, and raised many birds, and in recent years none of her livestock keepers had left the pig farm; at the same time, she tried hard to send her mountain village's primary school students, the children of the livestock keepers, to the village school by sleigh every day - the success of this event was not without arguments in the collective farm management office. She also talked about how she not only felt responsible for the production but also for the good life of the collective farmers in her work team. Last summer, she organized people, who used their rest time to restore the dam next to the old mill themselves, and with the voluntary help of the railway workers, the pig farm and the small village were electrified. Now they have electric lights, radios, and adult night schools in the evenings, and all the livestock keepers are studying in animal husbandry training classes. She also reported that many livestock keepers take turns visiting the best collective farms in the state in winter to see how livestock is raised and learn good experiences.
    
    "Now we understand, Comrade Goncharova!" Rudenko said, "It seems that the problem is not just disinfection and pig breeds! People might think that only pigs interest you. But it turns out you have been doing work with the livestock keepers. That's the key to success!..."
    
    Martynov did not speak at this meeting. Perhaps it was not because his voice was hoarse - he could still say a few words even with a hoarse voice. Obviously, he had not yet figured out how to respond to Opinkin and other Communists, whose speeches were caused by his own frank and excited talk today. The meeting could not be held in the same way as before. But how should it be held?
    
    The draft resolution prepared by the district committee was read by Zhibanov, the head of the propaganda department. He read for an hour.
    
    "Damn it!" Martynov bent down, put his head in his hands and cursed, "I didn't finish reading this work they wrote before the meeting. Alas, they have learned to write resolutions that weigh a whole pood!..."
    
    The draft resolution, in the so-called "factual part," narrated things that had been said a hundred times in past resolutions of the Party plenary sessions and activists meetings: that something was lagging behind in one aspect, and that some kind of work was abandoned. These were all copied by the district committee staff from old resolutions. However, there were also few new words in the "decision part." This part was also similar to what had been read many times from this podium to such meetings. It was still those words: "must," "pay special attention to," "strive for," "elevate to the proper level." The draft included all the issues that the Party district committee and grassroots Party organizations needed to do: radio broadcasting, collective farm amateur theater troupes, material propaganda, Young Pioneer work, agricultural knowledge learning, clearing clover seeds, preventing livestock epidemics, and building roads.
    
    After the basic content of the draft was put to a vote, Martynov made a suggestion - a suggestion that surprised and angered Golubkov again: to delete nine-tenths of the draft.
    
    He said: "In fact, we should punish those who don't spare our time, as Comrade Opinkin talked about here... Who in the collective farm Party organization wants to see this fifty-page resolution? Who has the time to read it all?"
    
    The hands raised were like a forest, in favor of reducing the draft resolution.
    
    Golubkov stood up, apparently wanting to refute Martynov, but after thinking about it, he waved his hand...
    
    In the rush, no one made any revisions or additions to the draft.

    In the evening, Golubkov and Martynov argued in the district committee.
    
    "I was embarrassed to correct your words and correct you, the first secretary, in the hall," Golubkov said, "But who knows what's going on, Comrade Martynov! You are teaching Communists not to respect Party documents and not to respect our resolutions!"
    
    "I am precisely respecting Party documents," Martynov answered, losing his self-control, "so I can't write such resolutions! Burying the main things in a sea of words. ‘Pay special attention!’ has been said twenty times. But in reality, what needs special attention?... It is you, these red tape people, who turn important Party documents into empty pieces of paper! Our fault is - that our instructors are not doing their work well. But even you, everything you pay special attention to when you come here is just on paper: how is the resolution written? Our comrades write such all-encompassing resolutions for you! I hope God blesses you, don't let you find fault! You ask: ‘Where is the wall newspaper? How is the teacher's work? So, you haven't done these things?’ ‘No, you can't, you can't find fault! We've done everything! Look, it's all written here. All ten resolutions have these items!’... Blindly believing in the power of paper: writing it down - means it's done. Ah! Far from being done!..."
    
    "You have led the Party activists' meeting away from the fundamental issues!" Golubkov insisted on his opinion: "You have not actually discussed the summary of the state committee plenary session. Haven't you seen that everyone has already raised doubts: Are there too many plenary sessions and congresses? Are we having too many meetings? This kind of meeting - is a school of Communist education!"
    
    "They should be schools of Communist education!" Martynov said, "It depends on what kind of meetings they are, and how they are held! If I entrust you to lead the meeting, I'm afraid that the result will not be this kind of school!"
    
    "That's how you presided over the activists' meeting today!... I am going to report on the results of this lack of preparation and your naivety, as well as your unserious attitude towards work, and a strange quirk that nobody knows about, you almost ruined the meeting today!"
    
    "Okay, report it then!" Martynov lost his patience, and began to put the documents on the table into the safe. "Report it! It's the right time - it's almost spring, so that the new secretary can become familiar with the situation in the district... But, I just think, Comrade Golubkov, not all the people in the state committee are... like you. They will investigate!"

    In the morning, Rudenko went to Martynov's house to see him. Martynov, Nadezhda Kirillovna, and their son Jimka were having breakfast in the dining room.
    
    "Please sit down, Ivan Fomich," Nadezhda Kirillovna pushed the fourth chair to the table.
    
    "Thank you," Rudenko declined, "I'm going to work. My wife has never let me go out hungry." He sat on the sofa, "Pyotr Illarionovich, would you like to talk about yesterday?..."
    
    "No, I don't want to talk about it. Let it be as it will!..." Martynov finished his tea and handed the cup to his wife to refill it. "Fomich, listen to what this situation can lead to. Jimka! Tell us what your Young Pioneer instructor said at the last meeting."
    
    Jimka was a boy of about ten years old, who looked just like his father, with the same blue eyes and black hair. He stood up and walked to the window, with his schoolbag hanging on the handle of the window sill.
    
    "She said to us: ‘Children, don't be embarrassed to go on stage. If you turn around after saying two or three sentences... - that's not called a speech.’"
    
    Martynov and Rudenko laughed.
    
    "We laugh. Generally speaking, this is not funny - it's worrying," Martynov said.
    
    Nadezhda Kirillovna looked at her husband inquiringly while clearing the table: "What are you talking about? What does ‘Let it be as it will!...’ mean? Has something happened?"
    
    "Nothing special, Nadya," Martynov comforted his wife, "I had a fight with the state committee instructor. He will certainly write a report to the secretary, he will lie about some things, he will exaggerate. But I can explain."
    
    "This Golubkov is really a meaningless person!" Rudenko shook his head and said, "Why let such a person do Party work?"
    
    "Wasn't he the state committee plenipotentiary who insisted on growing sugar beets in the mud for Golotov?" Martynov asked.
    
    "It was him, it was him! He had contact with Baurzov. The two of them had a big fight."
    
    On the way to the district committee, Rudenko said to Martynov:
    
    "The question raised by Demyan is correct. Twenty secret meetings a month, but the collective farm congress - once every six months. How are we working? What is this called work? We should think about it! The meetings we hold are often for form's sake. ‘Speak, say something! We should show activism!’ So people speak, say ‘something,’ and that's considered a meeting. Sitting there holding this kind of meeting is sometimes a little embarrassing."
    
    "Reporting is the foundation of everything," Martynov said, "If the report is not lively, the discussion will not be lively, so the whole meeting is in vain!"
    
    "Pyotr Illarionovich, I already told you about my report yesterday: I didn't have any strength left! I've made five reports this week. No, no, we talk too much, we encourage each other too much, just like Demyan said. We can't go on like this!"
    
    "Do you agree with Demyan? But you didn't mention it at all when you made the conclusion."
    
    "Because that was to discuss the summary of the plenary session, not to discuss how many meetings there are."
    
    "Fomich, you are really cautious!... Everyone sees and feels that we can't go on like this, but no one says anything. Ah, you, friends, assistants! Is it up to Martynov to take the lead? Is it always better to see the lump on someone else's forehead than on your own head?..."
    
    A week later, Martynov was called to the Party's state committee.
    
    Martynov was sitting in the state committee's Ministry of Agriculture minister's office with his long-term plan. The first secretary's reception room called on the phone to invite him to go there.
    
    The state committee secretary had held this position in the state for more than ten years. He was an elderly man in his fifties, who had participated in the domestic war and served as a cavalry company commander in the Chapayev division; during the Patriotic War, he served as a member of the military commission of a certain army in the South. He was slim and not tall, with unruly light yellow straight bangs that made him look young, which often fell to his forehead. It was said that he was very fond of rowing and hunting: he spent every day off either at the Temple Lake or in the Zhuguyev Forest.
    
    This was the first important conversation that Martynov had with him. In the past, Martynov had only met him briefly at a few plenary sessions and two meetings of the state committee standing committee: one was to remove Baurzov from his position, and the other was to recommend him - Martynov - to serve as the first secretary of the district committee.
    
    "Alexei Petrovich, this may not seem as urgent to you as it does to us grassroots workers," Martynov said, "But we, please believe me, are intolerable and can't stand it anymore! You rarely see bad meeting opportunities."
    
    "Do you mean to say that we, the people in the state committee, don't understand life and are divorced from reality?" the secretary frowned unhappily and said.
    
    "No, that's not what I meant... If you come to the venue and see that the meeting is proceeding without vitality, and the people are not talking sincerely enough, and they speak only for the record, then you will not be able to endure it, you will intervene, you will get angry. Generally, you will guide the meeting in the right direction. With you in attendance, the meeting will proceed well, but you can't see how the meeting proceeds without you!"
    
    "You're slippery, you're beating around the bush!" the state committee secretary smiled and said, "Have some tea," pushing a cup of strong tea with lemon to Martynov. "Please forgive me, we in the state committee don't have anything else to entertain guests with, have some biscuits!"
    
    "Oh, we in the district committee don't even have tea to entertain guests," Martynov broke off a biscuit and said, "Your finance department doesn't give us this expense... Alexei Petrovich, since we're talking about financial matters, then I'll talk about it in passing, it's not a big deal, but I always still have three thousand on my head..."
    
    "Why?"
    
    "We held a district-wide mechanic congress in December. We should give prizes to outstanding tractor drivers and combine harvester drivers, but the machine tractor station doesn't have this money. What should we do? We sold a mare from the district committee based on the resolution of the district committee standing committee. We didn't use this horse anymore. The district committee has two cars, the district executive committee has four horses, and this mare is old and doesn't have any horse equipment. We sold it to the forestry area for people to use for horseback patrols. But your finance department's instructor complained to me: ‘You don't have the right to sell things! The horse is the same as all the property of the district committee, and it is included in the state committee's balance sheet.’ But we didn't squander the horse on alcohol, and the money wasn't used for banquets, we bought five watches, a suit of clothing, and a bicycle, the meeting was held very well! We gave out prizes!..."
    
    "Are there receipts?"
    
    "How could there not be! There are receipts, and there is a list of prize winners."
    
    "But next time you want to reward sugar beet growers - what will you sell then? Sell the ‘Victory’ car?... Okay, write an application and give it to my assistant, we need to study it."
    
    The state committee secretary opened his briefcase and flipped through it.
    
    "So, Comrade Martynov, I have read the record of your lively Party activists' meeting..." He was silent for a long time, frowning, Martynov no longer drank tea, and carefully pushed the teacup away, making sure not to make any noise with the spoon. "This is Opinkin's speech... There are also speeches from the collective farm chairmen... The words are quite clever... But I don't agree with them. They are economic workers, extremely practical, and everything is converted into work hours, they see a bad thing in this - wasting time. But I, a Party worker, also see a harmful thing in another aspect... The most terrible thing - is not wasting time... If there is more than just one empty talker like your Korobkin, then what will they turn the Party meeting that we call a school of Communist education into? A school of empty talk?..."
    
    Martynov's heart jumped with joy:
    
    "Alexei Petrovich!..."
    
    "Wait a minute... People like Korobkin really think that this is the most genuine work - making the same remarks every day: ‘Fodder - is the foundation of animal husbandry!’, ‘Pigs are useful animals!’ creating a facade of work. Some people shout so loudly that the walls shake, and others read from paper - their remarks are of the same value. Empty talk - is a spiritual poison that numbs people's consciousness... People think that they have really done what is needed, important, and socially beneficial. Thinking that they are leading and influencing the life of the collective farm in this way. He sits there for six hours in a meeting, and his conscience is clear: he thinks he worked very well today! He listened to a speech that we must strengthen mass education work in the collective farm, and he himself also spoke, so loudly that his voice was hoarse. He went home very tired to eat and rest. You have to know that this is not called work, but escaping from real work by talking, just talking about work... When this kind of empty talk has become a specialty, has become the profession of some of our comrades - this is the most terrible thing!..."
    
    The secretary spoke calmly and slowly, often pausing for a long time before continuing, as if he were reviewing what he had said aloud in front of himself and Martynov.
    
    "Party congresses, activists meetings, and plenary sessions are not the goal. We don't hold meetings for the sake of meetings; but to make the Communists charge into battle after the meeting! To make them roll up their sleeves and get to work!... We use collective wisdom to solve major problems, and expose the shortcomings in our work. Young Communists learn to speak at Party congresses, learn to persuasively and

### 在一个会议上……
瓦连金·奥维奇金

专栏：

    编者按：“在一个会议上……”这篇文章，深刻地揭露了官僚主义的领导作风。像这样开冗长的会议，照念报告，而不深入群众，不了解情况，不解决问题的官僚主义，在我们国家里，也不是少见的。我们转载这篇文章，是为了引起大家的警惕，以便进一步克服官僚主义，改善我们的领导工作。
    在一个会议上……
    苏联　瓦连金·奥维奇金
    在文化宫举行了区的党的积极分子大会。
    关于不久以前开过的州委会全会的总结，是由区执行委员会主席鲁登科做的报告。因为区委会第一书记玛尔蒂诺夫同志患了感冒，嗓子沙哑了，脖子上缠着一条毛绒围巾，不能高声说话。区委会第二书记门得维杰夫同志，则正在休假期间。
    说实在话，这个报告不是“作”的，是念的，而且这样的报告委托给任何一个人来念，甚至委托给技术秘书来念都可以，只要是个嗓门高的人就行。或者为了节省时间，完全可以不念它——预先印几百份散发给全体参加会议的人。
    州委会全会讨论了两个问题：关于集体农庄中群众教育工作的情况和提高并发展饲畜业的措施。鲁登科也报告了州委会全会的决议。他单调地念了一个半小时；一分钟也没有离开区委会和区执行委员会工作人员所拟的讲稿，他没有抬过一次头，没有看一下他面前的大厅。会场上有的人在打盹，有的人和邻座小声谈话，坐在后排的人就偷偷对着袖口吸烟。
    玛尔蒂诺夫坐在主席台上，显出一副气恼的样子，手指神经质地玩弄着铅笔，蹙着眉头，用恶意的眼光看着鲁登科。
    谁也没有向报告人提问题。报名参加讨论的只有两个人。
    第一个发言的是区委会指导员尼科连克。规定给他发言的十分钟，他全部都用来列举他所负责的那些集体农庄党组织工作中的缺点：三个月没有举行一次党员大会，鼓动员愈来愈少，没有出墙报，共产党员在守护神节狂饮。好像他的任务仅止于此：即从这个集体农庄跑到那个集体农庄，用心记下一切“过错”，然后“反映”给区委会常委会委员。他的发言并没有改善玛尔蒂诺夫的心情。
    尼科连克发言以后，集体农庄女庄员岗查罗娃发言，她是一九三九年的党员，是养猪场的场长。
    会场上的电灯熄灭了，虽然会议在白天举行，然而主席台上的桌子后面有些黑暗：因为从结了冰的、撒满雪花的窗户上透过来的光线很少。女庄员苦恼地口吃着，一个字一个字地念她的讲演稿。
      “我们的成就……是顽强的……劳动和高度觉悟态度的结果。在抚育小猪方面……我们非常注意……生产小猪是在清洁的……消过……毒的地方……采用丰富的各种各样的……饲料来喂猪……和小猪，给它们创造良好的条件，我们能够从……母猪获得健康的生命力强的小猪……现在我们给自己提出……任务……这样来提高……饲畜业的收入……”
    甚至在演说中应该是谈得很热情的地方，她也是口吃的。
      “展开了生动……生动的……竞赛，我们保证要……”
    快讲完的时候，她把讲稿的页数颠倒了，她慌张起来，手足无措了，于是，有一句话还只说了半句，她就这样走下了讲台。
    坐在主席台上的人们，都由于羞愧和难为情而低着头。
    玛尔蒂诺夫站起来，要宣布休息。
    他用那伤了风的沙哑的嗓音问道：“‘友谊’集体农庄党组织书记在这儿吗？”
      “我就是，”从后边的几排站起来了一个男人，穿着一件没有肩章的军官大衣。
      “莫斯托沃依同志，是你替她起草的讲演稿吗？”
      “我……和集体农庄主席。”
      “你们费了心了！……区内一个最好的饲养员，她的能力足以使养猪场成为了模范养猪场，难道在这儿谈她自己的工作，如果没有你们作的小抄，还怕她能力不够吗？……岗查罗娃同志，你不要因为说的不好而不好意思。羞愧的不是你，而是我们……我在宣布休息以前想要说，同志们，”玛尔蒂诺夫斜眼看了看坐在主席台上的州委会指导员，预感到会和他有一场口角。他和这位经常到这个区来的果鲁布科夫指导员早有些不协调。“让我们这样商量好：谁如果没有什么值得说的，——那么最好就不要在这儿发言，不要耽误自己的时间也耽误大家的时间。我们不需要为了汇报用的积极性：
  ‘出席会议的人有百分之多少都发了言’。可是谈的是些什么，又是为了什么谈的呢？尼科连克刚才在这儿重新念了一个报告书，这是我们三天以前已经看过的了。党的积极分子聚在一起是为了认真地讨论问题，不是为了演说而来演说。现在宣布休息十五分钟。”
    人们不知怎么没有立刻走出去吸烟，大家有些惶惑。
    果鲁布科夫在台上抓住玛尔蒂诺夫说道：
      “你怎么了，彼得·伊拉里奥内奇，你不舒服了？发烧了吗？你最好回家去躺在床上。这儿还有常委会的委员们，你不在会也可以开。你是想打击党的积极分子吗？‘如果不会讲话—就不要发言’。” 
      “我并不是这样说的呀，果鲁布科夫同志！”
    “你是和教授一起开会还是怎样？这个会场上有一半是集体农民，你为什么吓唬他们？这个岗查罗娃—她是文化很低的！应该帮助她！”
    “我的话并不是向文化低的人说的”，玛尔蒂诺夫反驳道：“是向文化很高的人说的！我是向那些在这种会议上舌头已经磨出茧来的人们说的！”
    “不明白，”果鲁布科夫耸了一下肩膀说，“我不知道你们的党的积极分子会怎样。看吧，希望休息以后，鲁登科不要立即被迫要讲闭幕词。”
    “也许他不得不这样做……对于你来说，尼古拉·阿尔希波维奇，这当然是非常不愉快的。这是你所负责的这一个区里的特殊事件！党的积极分子大会失败了！只有两个人发言。这怎么向州委会去报告呀？何况你自己还出席了这个会。” 
    “我认为，这对于你也不是什么很愉快的事。”
    鲁登科走过来了。玛尔蒂诺夫说：
      “真是见鬼，你这种报告简直等于说吸烟对身体有害一样！”
      “彼得·伊拉里奥内奇！”鲁登科抓住他的肩膀说，“因为我没有时间准备呀！”
    “你在这个区工作了五年。人们你也都了解，同时你也很善于和人们谈话！结果你只是重说了一遍州委会的决议。可是你不说大家早已看过了！可是你自己的意见——却一点没有！……报告既然是这样，讨论也当然会如此！”
    “我的话已经干涸了。已经开了五天会了！我原想你会做报告的，可是你又要害病。”
    休息以后，虽然有玛尔蒂诺夫的警告，可是第一个发言的演说家正是那种舌头上已磨出茧来的人。这是区执行委员会农村建设部部长科罗布金。区内举行的任何一次会议，都少不了科罗布金的火热的演说。
    科罗布金又瘦又高，穿着一件长的黑呢大衣，前额高高的（因为秃头的原故），两只手威严地在讲桌上挥舞着，像是对着广场上成千上万的人喊口号一样，一个字一个字地喊着。天花板上挂着的枝形吊灯的玻璃，被他的声音震动得铿锵作响。
      “同志们！饲料——是饲畜业的基础！但是有的同志坚决不愿意理解这一点，非常错误地轻视饲畜业用的饲料的准备工作！……”
      “牛，同志们，牛是工作牲畜！工作牲畜是需要保护的！……”
      “同志们，猪可以供给我们肉、油、皮革、鬃！猪是一种很有用的动物！可是我们是怎样对待猪的呢？”
    “同志们，牲畜需要温暖的、建设得很好的畜棚。同志们，母牛要是在温暖清洁的地方就会比在寒冷肮脏的地方产的奶多些！可是有一些集体农庄主席，同志们，他们是不重视建造牛棚的！……”
      “谈到对集体农民的群众政治工作，我应该非常率直地说，同志们，我们对集体农民的工作做得很不好！……”
      “同志们，墙报，这是报刊！而报刊是我党最尖锐的武器！但是，是不是我们每个集体农庄都有墙报呢？没有，同志们，不是每个集体农庄都有墙报！……”
    玛尔蒂诺夫像患了严重的头疼似的皱着眉。
    他向坐在他旁边的鲁登科耳语道：“说十分钟的话，能够一句有用的都不说，这也需要本领呢！……”
    会场上开始有喧哗声：
    “科罗布金同志，你发言的目的何在呀？”
      “你对我们说的有什么用处呢？”
      “说什么猪能供给油？”
      “还有乳牛可以供应牛奶？”
      “请你说点正经事，不要白浪费我们的时间！”
    玛尔蒂诺夫用铅笔敲着桌子。
      “下边谁来发言？……”
    难耐的沉寂持续了五分钟左右。谁都不要求发言。看起来，好像会议就真的只能开到这里为止了。果鲁布科夫愤怒地看了看玛尔蒂诺夫，吱地一声推开椅子，站起来到台后面吸烟去了。显然，连玛尔蒂诺夫这时也感到自己不大好受了……但是会场上忽然举起了一只手，两只，三只。同时有五个人都要求发言。
    ……“苏维埃政权”集体农庄主席杰米扬·瓦西里耶维奇·奥平金走向俱乐部的舞台，踏着很重的步子上了台阶向主席台上的桌子走去。他不慌不忙地脱掉大衣，从上衣口袋中取出眼镜，笔记本，用上衣的衣襟擦了擦眼镜，摊开笔记本，咳嗽了两声。
      “同志们，这不是我的发言提纲，”奥平金开始说，“这是一个集体农庄主席的日记。就是说我的私人日记。我每天都写上我在什么地方和做了什么事。如果万一什么时候有人因为我把工作搞坏而告我——这就是我的辩护词。检查长看了就会明白并会同情我的。他会说：‘奥平金同志，我奇怪你怎么还会来得及在集体农庄中做了一些工作！’”
    奥平金在整个会场的凝神倾听之下继续讲下去，一边翻着笔记本：
    “让我们来计算一下，半个月之中我开了多少次会，算一算到月底还要开几次？……州委会全会是二号开的。我是州委会委员。叫我，我就去了。开了两天。然后让州苏维埃代表留下来开会。我就留下来了。又是两天。这儿跑跑，那儿跑跑，——整整一个星期没有回家。然后，到这儿，到区里来：区委会全会，区苏维埃会议，今天是党的积极分子会议。简言之，这半个月里，我总共在集体农庄中呆了两天。但是，还不仅如此。后天是我们村苏维埃会议，我要报告州苏维埃会议的总结。二十号，计划要召开集体农庄党员大会，也是讨论州委会全会总结。同志们，现在再来计算一下，集体农庄主席一个月会有几次被叫到常委会或执行委员会去。到了那里——有各种委员会。我就没有时间留在家中工作了！同时一切会议都是讨论：怎样改进工作，怎样提高这样，加强那样。但是，如果我们的全部时间都用来谈话，那什么时候去提高和加强呢？……党员大会——是不公开的，全会当然是秘密的，党的积极分子会议也是，而苏维埃会议也只是代表们出席。而会议谈的是怎样向群众做工作。我们关在屋子里互相说服应该更好地领导人民工作！……一个月中要开二十次会——工作真是紧张呀！可是一切会议都是不公开的，自己来鼓动自己！同时有一些集体农庄的全体庄员大会一年才开一次，只是做工作总结报告而已！……”
    奥平金通常在党委会全会和积极分子会上是很少发言的，这一次却不然了：
    “同志们，我并不反对在这个大厅里坐上一二小时。比如说，听个好报告，听听有关国际形势的演说等。让那有学问的人给我们谈一谈我们自己还没有来得及读，或者是不会深刻研究的东西。他告诉我们，——然后我们再向别人传达。但是，科罗布金同志却在这儿向我们证明，猪是有用的牲畜……这是不能令人忍受的！应该承认，在州的会议上也要听到不少这样的话。一个人走到讲台上滔滔地讲了半天！然后回想一下：他说的是什么呢？什么都没有！全都是一些这样的话：‘动员力量！’，
  ‘提到高度来！’主席也不制止。大家都喊‘够了！’，‘已到了规定发言限制时间！’——可是他还是滔滔地说。好像他的每个字都会得到报酬一样。而我们坐在那儿想：谁来为我们的时间付代价呢？五百个人坐在这里，你损害了我们多少时间！算一算这有多少工时！司机跑空车民警局要罚款，那是按吨公里计算。这是工时。这也是不小的价值呢！可是没有人来罚这些浪费时间的人！……”
    奥平金在全场赞扬的笑声和鼓掌声中走下来。
    在奥平金后边发言的人，——还有十来个人发言，所以如果按照“数字指标”来看，党的积极分子大会是“够水平的”，——几乎都谈到会议太多、高谈阔论，以及关起门来讨论需要和群众一道解决的问题等现象对工作的害处。
    主席台上坐在玛尔蒂诺夫身后的区报纸总编辑波索霍夫，从椅背上弯过身来笑着向他说道：
    “惰性的力量是多么可怕，彼得·伊拉里奥内奇！你看，你提出来了一个谈话题目：空谈的害处，于是就有多少个人谈到这个问题、互相重复着呀！……‘还需要开一次关于铲除各种会议的会！’”
    青年团区委书记雷什科夫发言说：
      “古时候在斯巴达，如果一个人能把别人一小时说不清楚的事用两三句话说出来，认为这是一种豪迈的事情。我们是否也应该恢复斯巴达的这种传统呢？”
    会场上有人反驳他说：
      “你自己都不守规定，已经说了十三分钟了！”
    “友谊”集体农庄党组织书记莫斯托沃依发言，这就是为养猪场场长岗查罗娃编讲词的那个人。他合理地、用事实责备了区委会机关工作人员的文牍主义的领导方法。
    “区委会指导员到我们基层组织来。他检查什么，他感到兴趣的是什么呢？就是什么时候开的党员大会，讨论的是什么问题。还有就是：有多少人发言，积极性够不够。呶，然后他看看决议，写得是否通顺。问一下工作计划——预备在工作队中读些什么，开什么座谈会，是否举行过了。可是在这些会议之后我们生活中有那些改变，这他是丝毫不感兴趣的！例如，一个工作队举行了关于全会决议的座谈会。工作队会后工作如何？集体农民们是否工作好些了？也许，这个队里出现了新的斯达哈诺夫工作者？竞赛更加火热了？如果任何改进都没有，那么，同志们，你们怎样进行的座谈？这就是说，还没有打动人心！那么我们一道再和人们谈谈吧，我来帮助你们！需要这样。但是我们那里不是这样做的。文件，只是文件！……有人说：不会工作不要紧——要学会报告得流畅，书面报告，那么就万事大吉！区委会工作同志们，是你们自己使得我们这样的！而您，玛尔蒂诺夫同志，显然，完全不管你的指导员们。你不通过他们，就直接来管集体农庄的事情。你愿意集体农庄中一切都有秩序，可是到现在为止，你还没有把自己的机关工作搞好！在您的鼻子底下，在区委会之中，既有官僚主义也有文牍主义，有您因而骂我们的那一切！……”
    玛尔蒂诺夫搔了一下后脑勺。事实究竟还是事实。他的手正好“没有伸到”最近的地方。他从未召集过一次指导员的会，没有和他们倾心地谈一谈，没有用生动的党的工作方法实际教导他们。区委会的书记们对待机关工作人员的态度，仍然是旧的，按照习惯——像是对普通的“全权代表”一样，派他们到集体农庄去最简单也最方便，因为他们时时都在手边……
    岗查罗娃又发了一次言，已经不是拿着讲稿了。这位妇女集中起思想，简单而有趣地说出为什么她的养猪场成为了模范养猪场。她说出他们怎样把养猪场全体工作人员的房子从村中运到十公里以外来，组成了一个新村，人们定居下来，开辟了花园，还养了许多鸟儿，近几年来她的饲畜员一个都没有离开养猪场；同时她怎样努力使他们山村的小学生们，饲畜员的孩子们，现在能每天用雪橇送到村里学校去读书——这件事的成功在集体农庄管理处不是没有经过争吵的。她还讲到她不仅感到对生产所负的责任，还感到对她的工作队的集体农民的美好生活所负的责任，去年夏天，她把人们组织起来，他们利用休息时间自己恢复起旧磨房旁边的堤坝，同时在铁路员工的自愿帮助之下，使养猪场和小村都电气化了。现在他们有电灯、无线电、晚上有成人夜校，全体饲畜员都在动物饲养训练班中学习。她还报告说，许多饲畜员在冬天轮流到州内最好的集体农庄去参观牲畜饲养情况，学习好的经验。
    “现在我们就明白了，岗查罗娃同志！”鲁登科说，“看起来，问题并不仅仅在于消毒和猪种了！那样人们也许要想，只有猪才使你感到兴趣。可是原来你对饲畜员们是做了工作的。这就是成功的根本之处！……”
    这次会上，玛尔蒂诺夫没有发言。可能并不是因为他嗓子沙哑了，——嗓子哑了也还是可以说上几句的。显然，他还没有想好怎样答复奥平金和其他共产党员们，这些人的发言是他自己今天坦白激动的谈话所引起的。会议不能像过去一样地开了。可是应该怎样开呢？……
    区委会所准备的决议草案，是由宣传鼓动部部长日巴诺夫来读的。他念了一个钟头。
    “真是见鬼！”玛尔蒂诺夫弯下腰，头伏在手上骂着说，“开会前我没有看完他们写的这个著作。唉，他们学会了写整普特重的决议！……”
    决议草案中，在所谓“事实部分”，叙述的是在过去党的全会和积极分子会议决议中说过一百遍的东西：某一方面落后，某一种工作荒废了。这都是区委会工作人员从旧决议中抄录下来的。但是，在“决定部分”也很少新鲜的话。这一部分也和那已经多次从这个讲台上向这种会议所读过的东西相似。还是这些话：“必须”，“给以非常的注意”，“致力于”，“提到应有的高度”。草案中包括了党的区委会和基层党组织需要做的一切问题：无线电化，集体农庄的业余剧团，实物鼓动，少先队工作，农业知识学习，清除三叶草种子，防止家畜流行病，修建道路。
    在对草案的基本内容付诸表决之后，玛尔蒂诺夫提出了一个建议，——这是又使果鲁布科夫惊奇而愤怒的建议：把草案删掉十分之九。
    他说：“事实上，应该像奥平金同志在这儿所谈的来惩罚那些不吝惜我们的时间的人………集体农庄党组织中谁要看这长达五十页的决议呢？谁有功夫来看完它呢？”
    举起的手像森林一样，赞成缩减决议草案。
    果鲁布科夫站起来，显然想反驳玛尔蒂诺夫，但是想了一下，把手一甩……
    仓促之中，没有任何一个人对草案提出任何修改或补充。
                ×　×　×
    晚上，在区委会中，果鲁布科夫和玛尔蒂诺夫吵了起来。
    “我在会场上不好意思来改正你的话，纠正你这位第一书记。”果鲁布科夫说：“但是鬼知道这是怎么回事，玛尔蒂诺夫同志！你教导共产党员不尊重党的文件，不尊重我们的决议！”
      “我正是因为要尊重党的文件，”失掉了自制力的玛尔蒂诺夫回答，“不能写这样的决议！把主要的东西都埋没在词藻的汪洋大海之中。‘异常注意！’说了已有二十次。可是实际上，需要异常注意什么呢？……这是你们，这些文牍主义者们，把重要的党的文件变成空洞无物的纸张！我们的罪过是——我们的指导员工作做的不好。但是连你也算在内，你来到我们这里所异常注意的只是纸面：决议写得怎么样了？我们的同志们写这样无所不包的决议是为了你！希望上帝保佑，不要使你找到岔子！你要问：‘墙报在哪儿？对于教员的工作如何？那么，你们没有做这些工作吗？’，‘不，你没有办法，你找不到岔子的！我们都做了！你看都写在这里。十个决议中都有这几项！……’盲目地相信纸面力量：写上了——就是做完了。啊！远不是已经做完了呢！……”
      “你使党的积极分子会议离开了根本问题！”果鲁布科夫坚持他的意见：“你们实际上并没有讨论州委会全会的总结。你没有看出来吗，大家已经产生了疑问：全会、大会是不是开的太多了？我们是不是开会开得太多呢？这种会议——是共产主义教育的学校！”
      “它们应该是共产主义教育的学校！”玛尔蒂诺夫说，“要看是什么样的会，要看怎样开法！如果委托你领导会议，我恐怕，其结果不会是这种学校的！”
      “你今天主持了积极分子会，是这样的开法！……我要报告这种缺乏准备和你的幼稚所造成的结果，还有你这种对待工作的不严肃态度，以及鬼知道的一股怪劲，你今天几乎把会议破坏了！”
    “好吧，报告去吧！”玛尔蒂诺夫失掉了忍耐，他开始把桌上的文件都收到保险柜中去。“报告吧！最好要快些。正是时候——快到春天了，好让新书记能够熟习一下区内情况……但是，只是我认为，果鲁布科夫同志，州委会的人并不都是……像你这样。他们会调查研究的！”
                ×　×　×
    早晨鲁登科到玛尔蒂诺夫家中去看他。玛尔蒂诺夫、娜杰日达·吉里洛夫娜和他们的儿子吉姆卡正在饭厅吃早饭。
    “请坐下来，伊万·弗米奇，”娜杰日达·吉里洛夫娜把第四把椅子推向桌边。
    “谢谢，”鲁登科推让说，“我是去上班。我妻子从来没有让我饿着肚子出来过。”他坐在沙发上，“彼得·伊拉里奥内奇，愿意不愿意谈谈昨天的事？……”
    “不，不想谈。爱怎样就怎样吧！……”玛尔蒂诺夫喝完茶，把杯子递给妻子让她再给他添一杯。“弗米奇，你听一听这种情况会弄到什么地步。吉姆卡！说一说你们少先队辅导员上次会上说的话。”
    吉姆卡是个十岁左右的男孩，长得酷似父亲，同样的蓝眼睛，黑头发。他站起来走到窗前，窗栏的把手上挂着他的书包。
    “她向我们说的是：‘孩子们，走上讲台上去不要不好意思。如果说上两三句就向后转……——这不叫演说。’”
    玛尔蒂诺夫和鲁登科哈哈大笑。
    “我们笑起来。一般说来这并不可笑——而是可忧的呢，”玛尔蒂诺夫说。
    娜杰日达·吉里洛夫娜一边收拾桌子，一边询问地看了看丈夫：“你们在说什么？什么叫‘爱怎样就怎样吧！……’发生了什么事了吗？”
    “没有什么特别的事，娜佳，”玛尔蒂诺夫安慰妻子说，“我和州委会的指导员吵了一场。他当然要向书记写报告，他会谎报一些，会过甚其词。但是我可以解释。”
      “这个果鲁布科夫真是没有意思的人！”鲁登科摇着头说，“为什么让这样的人来做党的工作？”
      “硬叫哥洛托夫在泥里种甜菜的，州委会全权代表是不是他？”玛尔蒂诺夫问。
      “是他，就是他！他和包尔佐夫有过联系。他们两人曾经大吵过一场。”
    在去区委会的路上，鲁登科向玛尔蒂诺夫说：
    “杰米扬提出的问题是正确的。一个月之中二十次秘密会议，可是集体农庄大会—半年一次。我们是怎样工作的？这叫什么工作？应当考虑一下！我们举行的会议时常是为了形式。‘发言吧，说些什么！应该表示积极！’于是人们就发言，说些
  ‘什么’，这就算开过会了。坐在那儿开这种会有时简直有些难为情。”
      “报告是一切的基础，”玛尔蒂诺夫说，“如果报告没有生气，讨论也就会没有生气，于是整个会议都是枉然！”
      “彼得·伊拉里奥内奇，我已经向你说过了我昨天的那个报告：我一点力气都没有了！这个星期之内作了五个报告。不对，不对，我们说得太多了，互相鼓动得太多了，正像杰米扬所说的。不能再这样下去了！”
      “你同意杰米扬吗？可是你做结论时丝毫未提。”
      “因为那是讨论全会总结，而不是讨论会议多少的。”
      “弗米奇，你真是小心翼翼呀！……大家都看到、感到不能再这样下去了，可是都不说。啊，你们，朋友们，助手们！是不是让玛尔蒂诺夫来打头阵呢？看到别人额角上的疙瘩，总是比自己头上的好受些吗？……”
      一星期之后，玛尔蒂诺夫被叫到党的州委会去。
    玛尔蒂诺夫带着自己的远景计划坐在州委会农业部部长室，第一书记接待室把电话打到这儿来请他去。
    州委书记在各州担任这个职位已经十来年了。是一位五十多岁上了年纪的人，参加过国内战争，做过夏伯阳师骑兵连连长；在卫国战争期间，曾任南方某军的军事委员会委员。瘦削的不高的身材，不驯顺的使他显得年青的淡黄色的直直的额发，时时落到前额来。据说他非常爱好划船和打猎：凡是休息日他不是在寺院湖，就是消磨在朱古耶夫森林。
    这是玛尔蒂诺夫第一次和他进行重要的谈话，过去玛尔蒂诺夫只是在几次全会和州委会常委会的两次会上匆匆和他会过面：常委会的两次会一次是解除包尔佐夫职务，一次是推荐他——玛尔蒂诺夫担任区委会第一书记。
      “阿列克赛·彼得罗维奇，对于您来说，这也许不像我们基层工作人员所感到的那样迫切。”玛尔蒂诺夫说，“可是我们，请相信我，已经是忍无可忍，实在受不了了！您看到坏的大会的机会是很少的。”
      “你的意思是想说，我们，州委会的人们不了解生活，脱离生活实际吗？”书记不满意地皱了一下眉头说。
      “不是，我想说的并不是这个……如果您来到会场，看到会议进行得毫无生气，人们谈的话不够诚恳，发言只是为了记录，那您会忍耐不住，您会干预其事，会发火的。一般地，您会把会议导向应有的方向，有您出席，会议会进行得很好，可是那没有您参加的会进行得怎样，您是看不见的！”
    “滑头，你到会转弯子！”州委会书记笑了说，“喝茶吧，”把一杯带有柠檬的浓茶推给玛尔蒂诺夫。“请原谅，我们州委会中再没有其他东西来招待客人了，吃些饼干吧！”
    “噢，我们区委会招待客人连茶都没有，”玛尔蒂诺夫掰开一块饼干说，“您的财政科不给我们这笔经费……阿列克赛·彼得罗维奇，既然我们谈到财政的事，那我就顺便谈谈，不是一件大事，不过我头上总是还有三千……”
      “为什么？”
    “我们在十二月份曾举行全区机械师大会。应该给优秀的拖拉机手和联合收割机手发奖品，可是机器拖拉机站没有这笔钱。怎么办呢？我们就根据区委会常委会决议卖了区委会的一匹母马。这匹马我们没有用了。区委会有两辆汽车，区执行委员会有四匹马，而且这匹母马已经老了，也没有马具。卖给林务区了，为骑马巡视的人用。可是你们财政科的指导员，告了我一状：‘你们没有权利卖东西！马和区委会全部财产一样，是算在州委会资产负债表之内的。’但是，这匹马并不是我们吃酒挥霍掉了，钱也不是用在宴会上了，我们买了五只表，一身衣料，一辆自行车，会议开得很好！我们发了奖品！……”
    “有账单吗？”
    “怎么会没有呢！有账单，也有得奖人名单。”
      “可是下一次你又想奖励甜菜种植者了——那你卖什么呢？卖‘胜利’小汽车吗？……好吧，写一个申请书交给我的助手，我们要研究一下。”
    州委书记打开公文夹翻阅。
    “这样，玛尔蒂诺夫同志，我已经看了你们那次热闹的党的积极分子大会的记录……”他沉默了很长时间，皱着眉头，玛尔蒂诺夫不再喝茶，小心地不使匙子发出响声，把茶杯推开。“这是奥平金的发言……这儿还有集体农庄主席们的发言……话说的相当聪明……但是我并不同意他们。他们是经济工作人员，极端讲究实际，一切都折合成工作时来计算，他们在这方面看到一件坏事——浪费时间。可是，我一个党的工作人员也在另一方面看到一件危害的事情……最可怕的——还不是浪费时间……如果像你们的科罗布金这样的空谈家不只一个的话，那么他们会使我们称之为共产主义教育学校的党的会议，变成什么样子呢？变成空谈的学校吗？……”
    玛尔蒂诺夫的心愉快地跳起来：
      “阿列克赛·彼得罗维奇！……”
      “等一下……科罗布金这一类人确实认为这也就是最真正的工作——每天都发表同样的言论：
  ‘饲料——这是饲畜业的基础！’，‘猪是有益的动物！’造成了一种工作的幌子。一些人喊的墙都震动了，另一些人照着纸念——他们的言论价值是
  一样的。空谈——这是一种麻醉人的意识的精神毒素……人们认为他们已真正做了需要的、重大的和对社会有益的事。认为他们就这样领导着，影响着集体农庄的生活。他坐在那里开了六小时会议，他的良心也是清白的：他认为今天工作的很好！他听了必须加强集体农庄中的群众教育工作的演说，他自己也发言，说的嗓子都哑了。很疲倦地才回到家中去吃饭、休息。要知道，这不叫工作，而是在谈话中逃避真正的工作，空谈工作而已……当这种空谈已经成为专门东西，已成为我们某些同志的职业时，——这才是最可怕的！……”
    书记平静地，慢腾腾地谈着，时常停很久才继续说，好像是在自己和玛尔蒂诺夫面前高声审查着早已说过的话一样。
      “党的大会，积极分子会议，全体会议都不是目的。我们不是为了会议而举行会议的；而是为了使共产党员们会后冲入战斗！为了使他们卷起袖子去工作！……我们用集体的智慧来解决重大问题，揭发我们工作中的缺点。年青的共产党员们在党的大会上学习着发言，学习着有说服力地，有条理地叙述自己的思想。他们学习着讲演艺术，以备以后在人民面前发言。这也是需要的：每一个共产党员应该是宣传员，鼓动员……但是，他们不应该向科罗布金之类的人学习！”
      “问题就正是在这里，阿列克赛·彼得罗维奇！”玛尔蒂诺夫说，“有着装样子的积极性！大会举行了，有人发言，记录写下来了——形式上是遵守了。在别的方面也许可以马虎一点，但是，党的工作是完全不能忍受形式主义的！青年团员，还有少先队员都在学我们的样子。形式主义和官僚主义是两兄弟。而在列宁全集最后一卷，第三十五卷的
  一封信中说过：如果说，有什么会断送我们，那就正是官僚主义。这我们当然是不能容许的。但是列宁曾警告过我们，这是多么严重的危险！……”
    两个共产党员，两位书记，很久地用研究的眼光互相对视着。他们将来也许还会在一起工作不止
  一年。州委书记高兴他们的思想的一致，玛尔蒂诺夫不止高兴，简直是快乐极了。
    州委书记走过办公室，站在一扇大窗户旁边。从四层楼的这扇窗子向外看，是一片广阔的景色，可以看到城郊工厂的新厂房，可以看到白雪掩盖起来的田野和地平线上的小树林。玛尔蒂诺夫也站起身来走近他。
      “‘演说家’这个名词，一般说来并不是坏名词”，州委书记说：“演说艺术——是我们很需要的一种艺术！可惜，近来它已经被贬低了，所有的演说都是照着稿子念……”
    “我还记得，我们在组织第一批集体农庄时期是怎样进行工作的。那个时期是很值得纪念的！那时候我们在农民面前讲话如果把鼻子藏在讲稿里，那我们还能吸引他们参加集体农庄吗？那是对于农村中的领导者的最严重的考验。如果你找不到人民最容易接受的语言，如果你不会和人们谈话，不会用话、用事实和个人的范例吸引他们跟着你走，那你的工作连一个月也作不了，非垮台不行！玛尔蒂诺夫同志，要根绝空谈但是不要委屈‘演说家’这个名词！这个名词不是用来开玩笑的。一切老革命者都是演说家。应该教导共产党员这种艺术！要重视真正的演说家，像重视其他各种艺术家一样……是的，至于果鲁布科夫他不会再到你们那里去了，他已经不只一次地向我们控诉地方上的领导，而这些控诉却转过来反对了他自己。我们不再使他做党的工作。你们那一组要另派一个指导员去……我们是不是都谈完了！好吧，请回去吧。”
    州委书记握了一下玛尔蒂诺夫的手：
    “过几天我要到你们区去，和你一块去出席我没有看到的‘坏会议’，我们来想办法怎样使它变好起来……是的，我们应该减少些互相之间的鼓动，而要增加与普通集体农民的生动工作。譬如说，先进工作者的集会，——这是最生动的工作，群众工作！但是这样的会也可以进行得没有丝毫好处。如果毫无感情地‘宣读’报告，提前准备一切讲话——这也是官僚习气，形式主义！……而你，玛尔蒂诺夫同志，你是个急躁的人！小心着陡峭的山坡会把一匹好马搞坏。”
    玛尔蒂诺夫又听见了这句话，甚至战栗了一下。但是他克制住了自己，他告诉州委书记说，他已经是第三次听到人们给他这个警告了。
    “怎么样，可见这个谚语用在你身上是正确的，”书记回答说，“我并不是说：你这匹好马一定会搞坏，而是说防备着不要发生这种情况才好！山坡是有的，我们也不能闭上眼不看它。这就是那个形式主义和它的亲兄弟官僚主义以及它们的全部亲属——这就是山坡……你也许认为我会轻松一些？你认为职位愈高，权力愈大，力量也就愈强吗？也是这样，力量较大些，但是山坡也更陡一些。规模是完全不同了。我们这里也有科罗布金这一类的人。而且你们那里的对我们这儿的这类人来说，简直是小巫见大巫。他们还在不停地向我们这儿的人学习呢！简直是些空谈能手！典型人物！……如果你让他在常委会上对某一个问题发表意见，——譬如说关于工作人员的问题，他会站起来开始大发雷霆。音调，眼神，手势！如果在远处听不到他的话的地方，你会想他大概是在宣布一个人的死刑。可是他只不过是在‘指示’。从音调来说，是一个揭发缺点的热情斗士，可是他的讲话的思想——是自由主义者，是蜕化分子的姑息者。或者讨论这个问题：同意不同意部里关于某一建筑工程的意见，时间是否拖得太长，也许我们要发掘一些后备力量可以缩短些日期？他于是又在速记员面前发表言论，这种言论，事后也可以这样解释，也可以那样解释。如果我们在缩短了的期限内不能完成并因而受到责备时，他就说：
  ‘我早就警告过，恐怕要责备我们的幼稚！这不是我的发言记录！’如果因为建筑的速度快而受到表扬时——他也会混到里边来。因为他基本上曾‘拥护’这件事！他甚至想把自己的名字填到受奖名单上去。简直是演员！……我告诉你，玛尔蒂诺夫，想揭穿这种演员还有点困难呢。他们有党龄，也有无可责难的历史，还有毕业证书，有威风的外表，也有工作历史。还有——联系。可惜，到现在还有包庇的事情存在。有的人在莫斯科一个有权力的大机关中——有朋友，有连襟。你如果碰他一下——电报、电话来了：‘解释一下！’‘有何根据！……’你要证明，这个人毫无气节，无原则性，你气喘喘地要求根据他的表现解除他的职务——看吧，过了不久，他又游到别的州中担任同样的工作去了！……”
    州委书记把玛尔蒂诺夫送到门口：
      “空谈这还不是全部，玛尔蒂诺夫同志。这是一种琐事，是以庸俗的态度对待党的工作的标志……比如说，州内准备开党代表会议。对于真正的共产党员来说，这种准备工作是党的生活中的严肃的重大事件。可是有多少庸人是从他自己出发来体验这种准备工作啊！他们想，会不会有重大变化呀，就是说，第一书记会不会换呀？各部会有什么草案呀？他们在各办公室徘徊，叽叽咕咕，打探风声。我们的部长会不会变动？据说他要被调去做经济工作。噢！那么说，部长要换了……最好不要派我到外地去。唉，真糊涂，那时提议要我在浴室洗衣联合厂工作，而我没有同意！浴室——总还是在城市内的。如果要赶我到很远很远的一个区中去做第二书记怎么办呢！第二书记还可以，要是让到科里去呢？使他们所激动的不是党代表会议将对州内生活有什么影响，不是想，经过会议的推动，落后的集体农庄会有怎样的改进？他们所担心的只有一件事：这大大小小的改变对他那微小的存在会有什么影响？会不会使他离开这熟习了的地方？等级、薪金会不会降低？简直是官吏！……总之，玛尔蒂诺夫同志，你不要以为我是向你诉苦。我并不抱怨困难。我只是向你说，庸俗作风有各种形式的表现，而和它斗争是有点困难的。困难，但并不是不可能。那么，既然能和它斗争——让我们就来斗争吧！……”
