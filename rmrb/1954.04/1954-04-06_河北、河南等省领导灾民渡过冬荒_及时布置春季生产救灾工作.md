Hebei, Henan and Other Provinces Lead Disaster Victims Through the Winter Famine
Timely Deployment of Spring Production and Disaster Relief Work

After some areas of Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Liaoxi provinces suffered from floods in the autumn of 1953, the local party and government leading organs attached great importance to this, and at the end of drainage and wheat planting, they launched and led the masses in winter sideline production. Due to the extensive and in-depth publicity of the general line, not only was the confidence of the masses in production for self-salvation universally improved, but the direction of sideline production was further clarified. In carrying out sideline production, all localities widely adopted the contract system and made full use of cooperative organizational forms to solve the difficulties of disaster victims in production such as labor, capital, technology, and tools. Therefore, after a winter of sideline production activities in many disaster areas, the food ration problem of the disaster victims was solved, and they were able to survive the severe winter peacefully. In areas where sideline production was well done, not only was "the famine eliminated in winter," but there was also surplus grain, and new vehicles and horses were purchased. At the same time, through winter production and disaster relief work, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the disaster areas were further consolidated and developed. As of the end of January, the disaster victims in Hebei Province who participated in sideline production had earned more than 495 billion yuan from sideline production, which could be exchanged for more than 600 million catties of coarse grains. In the production and famine relief, Tianjin Prefecture organized 10,592 mutual aid groups. Due to the development of sideline production, 45 percent of the disaster victims in the province have made up for all the grain shortage, and have a surplus to support spring plowing production. Another 41 percent of the disaster victims will not have major difficulties in their lives before the wheat harvest as long as they continue to engage in sideline production. In Henan Province, more than half of the disaster-stricken households in 89.8% of the disaster-stricken townships in six prefectures participated in sideline production. In Anyang Prefecture, 84.6% of the disaster-stricken townships basically realized the requirement of "eliminating the famine in winter." According to incomplete statistics from four counties in the prefecture, disaster victims purchased 356 head of livestock, 114 carts, 23 waterwheels, 525 farm tools, and built 167 houses from their sideline production income. In 58 disaster-stricken townships in Minquan, Shangshui, and other counties, 1,961 mutual aid groups combining agricultural and sideline production or engaging in sideline production were organized through production self-salvation. Junxian and Yexian developed 170 credit cooperatives and credit groups. Shandong and Liaoxi provinces have also achieved similar results.

Although the sideline production in the disaster areas last winter achieved great results, its development was not balanced enough. The grain shortage difficulties of some disaster-stricken households have not been completely resolved, and there are still some poor households in rural areas. Therefore, since the beginning of spring, the disaster situation in some areas has shown a tendency to develop again. In order to prevent the development of the spring famine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government issued the "Instructions on Carrying out Winter Production and Self-Salvation Work in Disaster Areas to Prevent Spring Famine Next Year" as early as December last year, and sent working groups to severely affected areas such as Henan and Shandong to inspect the spring famine situation. At the beginning of this year, the Central People's Government allocated a total of 358.4 billion yuan of spring famine relief funds to various places. On March 23, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government issued the "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in Spring Famine Relief Work to Prevent the Development of the Disaster Situation." Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Liaoxi and other provinces also took corresponding measures in a timely manner. Hebei and Henan convened production and disaster relief work conferences around the Spring Festival, and comprehensively deployed spring production and disaster relief work by summarizing the winter production and disaster relief work. Henan Province proposed that, regardless of the severity of the disaster area, before the wheat harvest, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of taking production and disaster relief and spring plowing production as the overriding center. Any work that hinders production and disaster relief and spring plowing production must be resolutely stopped, and all other work that must be carried out should also be combined with doing a good job in production and disaster relief and spring plowing production. Each prefecture and county is still under the collective leadership of the prefectural commissioner and county magistrate, specifically responsible for leading the production and disaster relief work. Grain supply points should be added in disaster areas to ensure the supply of food, seeds, and livestock feed to grain-deficient households. In order to ensure that the spring production and disaster relief work is well done, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has included the production and disaster relief work as one of the main contents of the provincial party representative meeting in March, and is preparing to convene a meeting of the county party secretaries and district party secretaries of the disaster areas and areas with severe spring famine after the meeting to specifically study the production and disaster relief work. The relevant departments also provided strong support for the disaster relief work. The bank issued 50 billion yuan in spring sideline loans to disaster areas; in addition to ensuring the supply of production and living materials for disaster victims, the commercial and cooperative departments also planned to purchase local and special products from disaster victims with a total value of more than 50 billion yuan; the spring repair projects of water conservancy, highways, etc. in various places will try to absorb disaster victims to participate and implement work-for-relief. Hebei Province proposed that disaster areas should adhere to the principle of putting production and disaster relief first, overcome the complacency of cadres, specifically organize forces, appropriately arrange various tasks, and the cadre force for production and disaster relief work should only be strengthened, not weakened. The three tasks of agriculture, sideline production, and work-for-relief in disaster areas should be specifically arranged according to different times and regions, and the superiority of being organized should be fully utilized to vigorously mobilize women to participate in agricultural and sideline production. It is necessary to continue to implement the State Council's "Instructions on Persuading Farmers to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities" to stabilize farmers in rural areas in order to facilitate agricultural production and national construction in disaster areas. The issuance of relief grain and funds must be conducive to organizing production. The province's spring water conservancy, transportation and other projects will invest more than 200 billion yuan and will also try to absorb disaster victims to participate. Shandong and Liaoxi provinces have also specifically deployed spring production and disaster relief work in accordance with the spirit of the general line.

    河北、河南等省领导灾民渡过冬荒
    及时布置春季生产救灾工作
    一九五三年秋季，山东、河北、河南、辽西等省部分地区遭受水灾后，当地各级党政领导机关极为重视，在排水种麦末期，即发动与领导群众进行了冬季副业生产。由于广泛深入地宣传了总路线，不仅普遍提高了群众生产自救的信心，而且进一步明确了副业生产的方向，各地在进行副业生产中，都广泛采用了合同制，并充分运用互助合作的组织形式，解决了灾民生产中的劳力、资金、技术、工具等困难。因此，许多灾区经过一冬副业生产活动，灾民口粮问题得到解决，安稳渡过了严冬。副业生产搞得好的地区，不仅“把灾荒消灭在冬季”，而且有了余粮，添车、买马。同时，通过冬季生产救灾工作，灾区的互助合作组织也得到了进一步的巩固与发展。截至一月底，河北全省参加副业生产的灾民从副业生产中获利四千九百五十余亿元，可换粗粮六亿多斤。在生产渡荒中，天津专区组织了一万零五百九十二个互助组。由于副业生产的开展，全省已有百分之四十五的灾民弥补了全部缺粮，并有盈余支持春耕生产。另有百分之四十一的灾民只要继续进行副业生产，麦收前生活也不会发生大的困难。河南省六个专区百分之八十九点八的受灾乡中，半数以上的灾户都参加了副业生产。安阳专区有百分之八十四点六的受灾乡基本上实现了“把灾荒消灭在冬季”的要求。据该专区四个县的不完全统计，灾民从副业生产收入中买进牲口三百五十六头、大车一百十四辆、水车二十三辆、农具五百二十五件，盖房一百六十七间。民权、商水等县五十八个受灾乡，通过生产自救组织了一千九百六十一个农副业生产结合或副业生产的互助组。浚县、邺县发展了一百七十个信用合作社和信用组。山东、辽西等省也获得类似成绩。
    去冬受灾区副业生产虽然得到很大成绩，但开展得还不够平衡，部分受灾户缺粮困难还没有获得全部解决，加以农村中还有一些贫困户，因此入春以来，某些地区灾情又趋发展。为了防止春荒的发展，中央内务部早在去年十二月间即发出了“关于开展灾区冬季生产自救工作，预防明年春荒的指示”，并派出工作组到河南、山东等重灾区检查春荒情况。本年年初中央人民政府拨付各地春荒救济款共达三千五百八十四亿元。三月二十三日中央内务部又发出了“关于做好春荒救济工作，防止灾情发展的指示”。河北、河南、山东、辽西等省也及时采取了相应的措施。河北、河南在春节前后召开了生产救灾工作会议，通过总结冬季生产救灾工作，全面部署了春季生产救灾工作。河南省提出不论轻重灾区，在麦收前必须坚决贯彻以生产救灾与春耕生产为压倒一切的中心，凡阻碍生产救灾与春耕生产的任何工作，必须坚决停止，其他一切必须进行的工作也应在做好生产救灾与春耕生产的基础上结合进行。各专区、县仍由专员、县长在党委的集体领导下，具体负责领导生产救灾工作。灾区应增设粮食供应点，保证对缺粮户的食粮、种籽及牲口饲料的供应。为了保证做好春季生产救灾工作，中共河南省委并把生产救灾工作列为三月份全省党代表会议主要内容之一，并准备会后召集灾区及春荒严重地区的中共县委书记、区委书记会议，专门研究生产救灾工作。各有关部门对救灾工作也作了有力的支持。银行发放春季灾区副业贷款五百亿元；商业合作部门除保证灾民的生产生活资料供应外，并计划向灾民收购总值五百余亿元的土特产品；各地水利、公路等春修工程将尽量吸收灾民参加，实行以工代赈。河北省提出：灾区应坚持生产救灾第一，克服干部麻痹思想，具体组织力量，适当安排各项工作，生产救灾工作的干部力量只许加强，不许削弱。灾区的农业、副业和以工代赈三项工作，应根据时间和地区的不同情况，具体安排，并要充分发挥组织起来的优越性，大力发动妇女参加农副业生产。要继续贯彻政务院“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”，把农民稳定在农村，以利灾区农业生产和国家建设的进行。救济粮款的发放，必须有利组织生产。全省春季水利、交通等工程共投资二千余亿元，也将尽量吸收灾民参加。山东、辽西两省也都根据总路线的精神，具体布置了春季生产救灾工作。（中央人民政府内务部救济司）
