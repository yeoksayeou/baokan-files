Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—The basic-level elections in the suburban areas of Beijing concluded at the end of March, marking the complete conclusion of the city's basic-level election work.

The basic-level election work in Beijing was carried out in two batches. The seven districts within the city began first in December of last year and ended in late January of this year. The second batch of basic-level elections, which began in the suburbs in February, was completed at the end of March. Each township convened its first People's Congress, elected the township head and committee members of the township people's government, and discussed and formulated the 1954 agricultural production plan.

The people in the suburbs demonstrated high political enthusiasm in the general election, with a very high percentage of voters participating. In the twenty-six townships of Gaobeidian and Xinzhuang in the eastern suburbs, the number of voters participating in the election reached 98.3% of the total electorate. As a result of the election, many labor models in industry and agriculture, advanced producers, leading cadres of factories and mines, and responsible persons of the district Party committees, district people's governments, and various people's organizations were honorably elected as representatives to the district people's congresses. Among them were Wang Wenbin, Director of the Shijingshan Power Plant; Li Kezuo, industrial labor model of North China and chief engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory; Hou Decheng, Beijing industrial labor model and blast furnace shift foreman of the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant; Ni Jiying, leader of the Beijing industrial production model group and young worker at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory; Yin Weichen, Beijing agricultural labor model and director of the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District; and Guo Rong, director of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative. Yin Weichen and Guo Rong, among others, were not only elected as township people's representatives, but also as district people's representatives. Many township cadres who have consistently served the masses loyally have been particularly supported by the people. Shuang Kuiquan, the head of Xinzhuang Township in the eastern suburbs, has been the township head since the liberation of Beijing. Under his leadership, 70% of the farmers in the township have joined agricultural production cooperatives. In the election, the voters unanimously elected him as a representative to the township people's congress, and he was unanimously elected as the township head at the township people's congress.

The suburban general election was closely integrated with production. In the general election, the employees of various factories and mines used creative labor to realize their slogan of "welcoming the general election with practical actions in production." Liu Dezhen, national industrial labor model and director of the steam turbine workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant, led the workers of the entire workshop to complete the overhaul of a certain machine two days ahead of schedule as a gift to the general election. Jiao Xinglin, Beijing industrial labor model and worker at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, created the "double fork-shaped sprue" casting method for plowshares to improve the quality of plowshares greatly in order to welcome the general election. The first People's Congresses held in various townships earnestly discussed the current spring plowing production and the annual production plan. The Sihai Township in Nanyuan District originally planned to increase grain production by ten catties per mu and cotton production by fourteen catties per mu. The township people's congress modified this plan based on the township's production conditions, and all the representatives unanimously agreed to increase the grain production plan from ten catties per mu to twenty catties, and cotton from fourteen catties per mu to twenty catties. The resolutions of the township people's congress were supported by the people of the entire township, and everyone expressed their determination to work hard to complete this plan under the leadership of the township people's government.
