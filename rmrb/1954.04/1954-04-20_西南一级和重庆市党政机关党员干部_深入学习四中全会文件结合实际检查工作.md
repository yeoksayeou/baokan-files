    [Dispatch from this newspaper, Chongqing, 19th] More than 90,000 Party member cadres from the first-level Southwest and Chongqing municipal Party and government organs have been deeply studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. After listening to the reports conveying the resolutions, cadres from all organs, under the leadership of Party organizations, formed study groups according to different levels, earnestly reading and discussing the Fourth Plenary Session documents and relevant People's Daily editorials. Cadres from the Southwest Bureau directly affiliated Party Committee and the finance and economics, culture and education, and political and legal Party committees of the Southwest Administrative Committee, in their studies, generally, on the basis of understanding the documents, combined with reality, deeply criticized bourgeois individualism and complacency, examined decentralism, and strengthened collective leadership. Some units with existing problems of unity, through self-criticism, resolved problems that had not been resolved in the past. Therefore, the mood for studying is very good. At the representative meeting of staff members of the Southwest Local Industry Bureau, after criticizing various phenomena that hindered unity, they also passed resolutions to improve the working system of the organs, strengthen organization and discipline, and overcome commandism and bureaucracy. The Chongqing No. 102 Factory Party Committee led the cadres of the entire factory to deeply criticize complacency and conservative thinking in production in light of the production situation. After this period of study, the political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the Party member cadres have been generally improved, the unity and combat effectiveness of the Party have been further strengthened, and it is unanimously believed that the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session is a warning bell rung by the Central Committee for the entire Party during the transition period, and is a reliable guarantee for implementing the General Line.
