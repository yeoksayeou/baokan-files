Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 11th: The mass technical innovation movement at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has propelled China's labor competition from a preliminary stage to an advanced stage, and pointed out a direction for transforming China's original industrial and mining enterprises and leveraging the potential of existing enterprises.

The mass technical innovation movement at Anshan Iron and Steel began on September 16, 1952, when Zhang Mingshan, a worker at the Anshan Small Rolling Mill, successfully created the anti-collar method. In 1952, the production of many factories and mines at Anshan Iron and Steel exceeded the highest levels during the puppet Manchukuo period. At that time, the preliminary labor competition relying on labor enthusiasm and physical strength could no longer create more wealth for the country. Therefore, the question of how to further increase production and leverage the potential capabilities of existing enterprises in the campaign to increase production and practice economy was sharply presented to all employees. Zhang Mingshan's successful creation of the anti-collar method quickly changed the production outlook of the small rolling mill, pioneering a new path for socialist labor competition. This event attracted great attention from the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. With timely praise and strong calls from the leadership, a labor competition centered on technical innovation was launched throughout Anshan Iron and Steel. In particular, the morale of the workers in small factories was even higher. In the past year and a half, workers and technicians in Anshan Iron and Steel's mines, iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, machinery, and other factories and mines, with the help of Soviet experts, have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals and created hundreds of advanced experiences and operating methods. There have been 545 relatively significant technical innovations in mechanical and electrical equipment, of which 309, such as the automatic return track for agglomerate ore at the concentrator and the automatic cutting machine at the steel rope factory, have been successfully tested. In particular, after young worker Wang Chonglun created tools such as the "universal tool tire," he completed the equivalent of four years of production tasks in 1953, establishing a banner on the industrial production front for breaking through old production quotas and old technical standards. This mass technical innovation movement has ensured that Anshan Iron and Steel exceeds the state production plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy. In 1953, the total output value of Anshan Iron and Steel increased by nearly 100% compared to 1951, and labor productivity increased by 65%.

In the mass technical innovation movement, the hundreds of mechanical and electrical equipment created by Anshan Iron and Steel workers can create wealth worth several hundred billion yuan for the country every year, and also greatly improve labor productivity and save a large number of workers. According to statistics on only 68 of these pieces of equipment, they can create a profit of 72.5 billion yuan for the country every year. Fifty-nine technical innovations achieved by units such as the steel rope factory, small rolling mill, power plant, and chemical plant can free hundreds of workers from heavy manual labor. Fifty-four pieces of equipment created by workers in factories such as the machinery general factory, concentrator, metal products factory, and steelmaking plant can save 546 workers. The establishment of a collar at the small plant improves rolling efficiency by 35.9% and saves 71% of manpower. After the medium-sized plant created the "iron dustpan" device for rolling flat steel, the ability to roll flat steel increased by 31.2%. After the mechanization of steel rolling operations at the metal products factory, labor productivity increased by 16.7%. The technical innovation movement has leveraged great production potential with very little expenditure. For example, the 25 pieces of equipment created by workers in the small factory create wealth for the country every year equivalent to 50 times the cost of manufacturing these equipment. The investment in the seven pieces of equipment created by the metal products factory was only over 40 million yuan, while the net profit added to the country every year can reach 4.6 billion yuan.

The achievements of the technical innovation movement at Anshan Iron and Steel have improved the labor conditions of workers, reduced physical labor, and reduced occupational diseases and personal accidents. During the period of the enemy puppets, workers in the concentrator, small factory, and steelmaking plant described their miserable lives at the time by saying: "The concentrator is like a pigsty, the small factory is like the Palace of Yama, workers have to eat this bowl of rice, it's harder than passing through the gates of hell in steelmaking." However, the technical innovation movement began to fundamentally change this situation. When the anti-collar method was successfully created, it is not difficult to understand the feelings of the workers at that time who cheered and carried Zhang Mingshan up, because from then on, the workers in the small factory no longer have to risk their lives and can no longer produce by clamping red-hot steel bars. As one worker said, "This creation can let us live ten more years!" In the past, strong young men among the workers in the small factory would get tired of back pain, leg pain, and cramps after working for a year or two. Now, various occupational diseases and personal accidents have been greatly reduced, and the attendance rate has generally increased. For example, after the steel rope factory installed small cranes, workers no longer have to move 90-kilogram hot wire coils from the operating table, thus avoiding scalding accidents.

The mass technical innovation movement in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel is continuing to unfold under leadership. There are currently more than 200 pieces of equipment being researched and created. Workers and technicians in various factories and mines are determined to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in this movement, continue to transform old enterprises with new technologies, further improve labor productivity, and produce more steel for the country.

    鞍钢群众性技术革新运动
    把劳动竞赛推进到新阶段
    并为现有工矿企业的改造指出了一个方向
      【新华社鞍山十一日电】鞍山钢铁公司开展群众性的技术革新运动，已把我国的劳动竞赛由初级阶段推进到高级阶段，并为改造我国原有工矿企业和发挥现有企业的潜在力量指出了一个方向。
    鞍钢群众性的技术革新运动，自一九五二年九月十六日鞍钢小型轧钢厂工人张明山创造反围盘成功开始。在一九五二年，鞍钢许多厂矿的生产都超过了伪满时期的最高水平。当时，凭劳动热情拚体力的初级的劳动竞赛已不能为国家创造更多的财富，因此在增产节约运动中如何进一步的提高生产，发挥现有企业潜在能力的问题，就非常尖锐地提到全体职工的面前了。张明山首创反围盘成功，迅速改变了小型轧钢厂的生产面貌，为社会主义的劳动竞赛开创了新的途径。这件事引起了中共鞍山市委会、鞍山钢铁公司、鞍山市人民政府和市工会联合会的很大重视。经过领导方面及时的表扬和有力的号召，一个以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛就在全鞍钢发动起来了。特别是小型厂工人的情绪更加高涨。一年半以来，鞍钢的矿山、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、机械等厂矿的工人和技术人员在苏联专家帮助下，提出了成千上万条的合理化建议，创造了数以百计的先进经验和操作方法，在机械和电气设备方面比较重大的技术革新就有五百四十五件，现已试验成功的有选矿厂的团矿自动回车道、钢绳厂的自动切断机等三百零九件。特别是青年工人王崇伦创造了“万能工具胎”等工具后，在一九五三年内完成了相当于四年的生产任务，为工业生产战线树立了突破旧的生产定额、旧的技术标准的旗帜。这一群众性的技术革新运动，保证鞍钢超额完成国家生产计划和增产节约计划。一九五三年鞍钢的生产总值比一九五一年增加了将近一倍，劳动生产率提高了百分之六十五。
    在群众性的技术革新运动中，鞍钢工人所创造的数百种机械和电气设备，每年可为国家创造数千亿元的财富，还大大地提高了劳动生产率和节省出大批劳动力。仅据其中的六十八件设备统计，每年就可为国家创造七百二十五亿元的利润。钢绳厂、小型轧钢厂、发电厂和化工厂等单位五十九件技术革新的成就，能够使几百个工人摆脱笨重的体力劳动。机械总厂选矿厂、金属制品厂、炼钢厂等厂工人所创造的五十四件设备，可以节省出五百四十六个劳动力。小型厂的立围盘提高轧出效率百分之三十五点九，节省百分之七十一的人力。中型厂创造轧制扁钢的“铁簸箕”装置后，使轧扁钢能力提高百分之三十一点二。金属制品厂轧钢操作机械化后，提高劳动生产率百分之十六点七。技术革新运动以很小的开支发挥了很大的生产潜力，像小型厂工人创造的二十五件设备，每年为国家所创造的财富就相当于制造这些设备的费用的五十倍。金属制品厂创造的七件设备投资只四千多万元，而每年给国家增加的纯利可达四十六亿元。
    鞍钢技术革新运动的成就改善了工人的劳动条件，减轻了体力劳动，减少了职业病和人身事故。在敌伪时期，选矿厂、小型厂和炼钢厂的工人形容当时的悲惨生活说：“选矿好像大猪圈，小型赛似阎王殿，工人要吃这碗饭，难过炼钢鬼门关。”但是技术革新运动开始从根本上改变了这种情况。当反围盘创造成功时，人们不难理解工人们当时都欢呼着把张明山抬起来的心情的，因为从此小型厂的工人可以不冒生命的危险，可以不再夹着通红的钢条进行生产了。正如一个工人所说：“这一创造我们可以多活十年啊！”过去小型厂工人中挺结实的小伙子，干一两年就累得腰痛、腿痛、抽筋。现在各种职业病和人身事故都已大大减少，出勤率普遍提高了。又如钢绳厂装置小吊车后，工人们也不必再把九十公斤重的热线盘从操作台搬上搬下，这样就避免了烫伤事故。
    鞍钢各厂矿群众性的技术革新运动在继续有领导地展开着，目前正在研究和创造中的设备就有二百多件。各厂矿的工人和技术人员都决心在这个运动中学习苏联先进经验，继续以新的技术改造旧的企业，进一步提高劳动生产率，为国家造更多的钢铁。
