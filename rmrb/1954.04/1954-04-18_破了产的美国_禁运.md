	Suffering the Consequences of One's Own Actions

Last November 27, the British Labour Party's "Tribune" weekly published an article commenting on the United States suffering the consequences of its own "embargo." The article pointed out that the entire Western world, especially the United States, is experiencing a crisis of overproduction. If the "embargo" continues, industry will continue to decline, and by June 1954, the United States will have five million unemployed. The article also pointed out that the general manager of Chrysler Motors Export Corporation in Detroit recently gave a speech, citing trade with New China as the "only glimmer of hope" for the American "auto industry."

The article said: "As the economic recession in the United States deepens, more and more manufacturers are eagerly eyeing the Chinese market. It now seems that McCarthy will have to order the U.S. Navy to aim its guns at his errant compatriots" (McCarthy had clamored for the Navy to destroy any ships of U.S. allies trading with New China).

The United States' implementation of the "embargo" was originally intended to "strangle" the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, but it has harmed the United States itself. This is truly lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet, suffering the consequences of one's own actions.

	Locked Itself In

According to a Reuters dispatch from Penang, Malaya, on April 2, the Penang Chamber of Commerce in Malaya expressed strong complaints about the American "embargo" policy. The Penang Chamber of Commerce said in its annual report: "This ban (referring to the American 'embargo' policy) continues to hamper Malaya's export trade," because the sales of tin are restricted, leading to a drop in tin prices, and many tin mines have closed down. In 1953, tin production had already decreased by 22,461 piculs.

The facts mentioned in the Penang annual report prove the views of British Labour MP Silverman. Silverman believes that the "only result" of implementing the "embargo" policy is to "lock itself in" (United Press International, London, February 23). (Attached picture) By Fang Cheng

### 破了产的美国“禁运”

    破了产的美国“禁运”
    自作自受
    去年十一月二十七日，英国工党的“论坛”周刊，发表了一篇评美国自食“禁运”恶果的文章。文章指出：整个西方世界，尤其是美国正在发生生产过剩的危机，要是继续执行“禁运”，工业将会继续衰退下去，那么到一九五四年六月，美国将有五百万人失业。文章又指出，最近底特律克莱斯勒汽车出口公司总经理发表演说，曾把和新中国贸易，作为美国“汽车工业仅有的一线希望”。
    文章说：“随着美国经济衰退的加深，越来越多的制造商眼巴巴地望着中国市场，现在看来，麦卡锡一定要美国海军把炮口对着他的犯了错误的同胞了”（麦卡锡曾叫嚣用海军击毁与新中国贸易的美国任何盟国的船只）。
    美国执行“禁运”，原打算“窒息”苏联和人民民主国家，结果却损害了美国自己，这真是搬起石头打了自己的脚，自作自受。
      把自己封锁了起来
    据路透社槟榔屿四月二日电讯消息，马来亚槟榔屿商会对美国的“禁运”政策，发出强烈的怨言。槟榔屿商会在它的年报中说：“这种禁令（指美国的“禁运”政策）继续妨害着马来亚的出口贸易”，因为锡的销路受到限制，以致锡价下跌，很多锡矿都倒闭了。一九五三年，锡的生产已下降了二万二千四百六十一担。
    槟榔屿年报中提到的事实，正证明了英国工党议员雪维尔曼的见解。雪维尔曼认为：执行“禁运”政策的“唯一结果是把自己封锁起来”（合众社伦敦二月二十三日电）。（附图片）方　成作
