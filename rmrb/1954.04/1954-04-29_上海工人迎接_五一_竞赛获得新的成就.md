    Shanghai workers, having successfully completed their first-quarter production tasks, launched a labor competition in early April to greet "May Day," achieving significant results. Workers in Shanghai's iron and steel system have displayed a high degree of creativity. Employees at the Asia Iron and Steel Factory improved furnace construction methods and strengthened furnace maintenance, extending the lifespan of electric furnaces, which originally required overhauling after only 40 to 50 heats, to 66 heats. They are now striving for a record of 70 heats. The expansion project of the "converter" workshop at Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1, which began in December last year, was originally scheduled for completion in July of this year. Due to the workers' enthusiastic labor competition, they completed the expansion and machine installation more than two months ahead of schedule, and it was put into production on April 21st. The early completion of this project saved the state over 9 billion yuan in funds. Workers at Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 completed the open-hearth furnace overhaul project, originally scheduled for 35 days, in 30 days.
    Among the advanced production groups in Shanghai's hardware industry, the Xu Xizhai sand casting group at Shanghai Turbine Factory completed the sand casting of 15 diesel engine bodies by April 23rd, exceeding the group's highest previous monthly output. They will produce two more diesel engine bodies before "May Day" as a gift. Chen Xiulin, a labor model in the hardware industry from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, and his group actively studied Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation. Focusing on key production issues within their group, they identified seven "tricks" that could increase production efficiency by one to five times, enabling the entire group to complete their April tasks 11 days ahead of schedule. Workers at the Shanghai Wire Factory are actively preparing for the trial production of new products to successfully complete the trial production of three Soviet-style new products: large "T-shaped copper bars," "150-square paper-insulated power cables," and high-voltage "X-ray power cables" during the "Red May."
    Workers engaged in basic construction at various construction sites in Shanghai are conducting a labor competition focused on "good quality, speed, economy, and safety." Workers at the No. 9 direct construction site of the Shanghai Construction Engineering Company, responsible for building cadre dormitories for the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, have improved 25 tools and operating methods, greatly increasing work efficiency. They are striving to complete all projects before "May Day" and, while ensuring quality, will save the state over 4 billion yuan in construction costs.
    Workers in Shanghai's textile factories are striving to weave more and better fabrics to meet the needs of the people. They are all conducting labor competitions focused on reducing cotton consumption, increasing the rate of first-quality cloth, and reducing yarn breakage. The Yi Shijuan group of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, a well-known textile labor model, is working to ensure the completion of April's production tasks according to the work plan to greet "May Day." In the past, the average doffing stop time in the spinning room was 40 seconds. To greet "May Day," they are striving to reduce it to no more than 35 seconds. The Dai Ketu maintenance group of the same factory is also striving to comprehensively over fulfill the April group plan and has proposed a friendly competition with other maintenance groups in the factory. In the Gong Jindi group, a labor model at the joint state-private Unified Yarn Factory, the rate of substandard cloth has been reduced from 0.23% to 0.2%, a decrease of about 90% compared to last year. Workers at the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory currently have an average substandard cloth rate of 1.5%. Workers have guaranteed to reduce the substandard cloth rate to below 0.9%.
    Shanghai's dock loading and unloading workers have also joined the competition. Workers at the Rihui Port Loading and Unloading Supply Station achieved breakthroughs in loading and unloading quota hours for 80% of the goods during the "May Day" labor competition. It originally took 70 minutes to load 30 tons of soap into a covered wagon, but now it only takes 24 minutes.

    上海工人迎接“五一”竞赛获得新的成就
    上海很多工厂的工人，胜利地完成了第一季度生产任务以后，从四月初起，先后展开了迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛，已取得了很大成绩。上海钢铁系统的工人，发挥了高度的创造性、亚细亚钢铁厂的职工们改进了筑炉方法，加强炼炉保养工作，使原来只能炼四十至五十炉就要翻修的电炉炉龄延长到六十六炉，现在他们正向炼到七十炉的纪录前进。上海钢铁公司第一厂去年十二月份施工的“转炉”车间的扩建工程，原定今年七月份完工，由于工人们展开了热烈的劳动竞赛，他们提前了两个多月完成了扩建与机器安装工程，已于四月二十一日投入生产。这一工程的提前完成，为国家节省了九十多亿元的资金。上海钢铁公司第三厂的工人，以三十天完成了原定三十五天才能完成的平炉翻修工程。
    上海五金工业先进生产小组上海汽轮机厂许锡斋翻砂小组，到四月二十三日为止，完成了十五部柴油机大身翻砂工作，超过了这个小组过去最高的月产量。他们将在“五一”前将再增产两部柴油机身，作为“五一”的献礼。五金工业劳动模范、上海柴油机厂陈修林和他的小组，积极学习王崇伦生产革新精神，针对本小组生产关键问题，找到了能提高生产效率一至五倍的“窍门”七件，使全组四月份的任务提前十一天完成。上海电线厂的工人，正在积极为试制新产品作好准备工作，以便在“红五月”顺利完成大型“T形铜排”、“一五零平方纸绝缘电力电缆”和高压“X光电力电缆”三种苏联式新产品的试制任务。
    在上海各工地担负基本建设的工人，正在开展“好、快、省、安全”的劳动竞赛。为上海市人民政府建筑干部宿舍的上海市建筑工程公司第九直属工地的工人，改正了工具和操作方法二十五种，大大提高了工作效率；他们正争取在“五一”前完成全部工程，他们在保证质量的前提下，将为国家节省四十多亿元的建筑费用。
    上海各纺织工厂的工人，为了织出更多更好的布匹满足人民的需要，他们都正在以降低用棉量，提高正布率，减少断头率为内容开展劳动竞赛。著名的纺织劳动模范、国营上海第二棉纺织厂裔式娟小组，正为保证按作业计划完成四月份的生产任务来迎接“五一”，过去细纱间落纱停台时间，平均在四十秒钟，为了迎接“五一”他们正争取不超过三十五秒钟。该厂戴可都保全小组也正在争取全面超额完成四月份小组计划，与全厂各保全小组提出友谊竞赛。在公私合营统一纱厂的劳动模范龚金弟小组里次布率已由百分之零·二三降到百分之零·二，次布率已比去年降低了百分之九十左右。国营上海第十六棉纺织厂的工人，目前他们的次布率平均是百分之一·五，工人们已保证把次布率降到百分之零·九以下。
    上海各码头装卸工人，也同样投入了竞赛。日晖港装卸供应站的工人，在迎接“五一”的劳动竞赛中，做到了百分之八十的货品突破了装卸定额工时，原来要七十分钟，才能装好三十吨篷车的肥皂，现在只要二十四分钟就可以装好一车。
