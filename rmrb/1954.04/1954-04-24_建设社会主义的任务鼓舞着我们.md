The Task of Building Socialism Inspires Us
Shan Changju, Steelworker, No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace, Steelmaking Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

In the first quarter of this year, all comrades of our No. 6 open hearth furnace exceeded the state plan by more than two thousand tons of steel, with a quality exceeding the plan by 0.58 percent. In March, we produced a total of twelve heats of quick steelmaking.

This achievement is the result of the joint efforts of all three shifts. For steelworkers, the most important thing to do to improve production is the close cooperation of the three shifts. The three shifts on our furnace are very united, and everyone helps each other to create good conditions. For example, Hu Lian'ge, a steelworker from Shift A, often sweeps the area in front of and behind the furnace clean, and prepares all kinds of tools and materials when he hands over to me. When we take over, we are 80 percent sure that we can achieve quick steelmaking. Guan Shu'en, a steelworker from Shift C, also does the same. When taking over from my shift, he often tells me his good experiences and points out the shortcomings in our work. All our comrades are like this, with a sense of the overall situation. For example, my first assistant, Wang Deyuan, always prepares everything well in advance before each tapping, placing the hooks and oxygen pipes for the tap hole, and various materials for repairing the furnace in a convenient place, so that whatever is needed is available. All those working on our furnace are young lads, and they are so energetic when they work.

Why do we work so actively? In a word, it is because we know what it is for to produce more steel. Last August, I went to Romania to participate in the 4th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship. At the meeting, representatives from various countries warmly embraced us and welcomed us. When I was in China, I always said that our motherland was great, but I never felt it so concretely as this time. Why do they love us and respect us so much? It is because we have contributed to the cause of defending world peace. Representatives from capitalist countries said: The most ferocious in the world is American imperialism, but American imperialism was defeated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Korean representative embraced us, tearfully thanking us, saying that they would never forget the great Chinese people's help to Korea. We were all moved to tears at that time. I thought to myself: If we can produce more and better steel, wouldn't we be able to better defend peace! This year, after studying the general line, we have a clearer understanding of the importance of steel. To build socialism, our steel plant is the most important department. The more steel we produce, the greater the strength of building socialism; the faster we produce, the faster the pace of national industrialization. We smelt every heat of steel to defend world peace and to build socialism. That is why we are always so energetic when we work. I and all the comrades on our furnace have discussed it, and we guarantee to the motherland and to Chairman Mao: In the second quarter of this year, we will not only maintain the number of quick steelmaking heats, but also exceed the level of the first quarter in terms of quality. We did not complete our cost plan in the first quarter, and this shortcoming must be remedied in the second quarter. (Attached picture)

    建设社会主义的任务鼓舞着我们
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂第六号炼钢炉炼钢工　单长巨
    今年第一季度，我们第六号平炉的全体同志在完成国家计划之外，多出了二千多吨钢，质量超过计划百分之○·五八，在三月份里，我们一共出了十二炉快速炼钢。
    这个成绩是我们三个班全体同志一齐努力的结果。对炼钢工人来说，要把生产搞好，最重要的就是三个班密切合作。我们炉上这三个班团结得是很好的，大家都互相帮助创造好条件。像甲班的炼钢工胡连阁给我交班的时候，常把炉前炉后扫得干干净净，各种工具、材料准备得齐齐全全，我们一接班，就有十分之八的把握能实现快速炼钢。丙班的炼钢工关述恩也是这样，在接我的班时，常常把他们的好经验告诉我，指出我们工作中还有哪些缺点，我们所有的同志都是这样，有整体观念。像我的第一助手王德元在每次出钢之前，总是早早就把准备工作做好了，把出钢口用的钩子、氧气管，补炉用的各种材料，都放在顺手的地方，到时候用什么有什么。在我们这个炉子工作的，全是年青小伙子，干起活来都是这么带劲。
    我们为什么这样积极干活呢？一句话，就是因为我们知道多出钢是为了什么。去年八月，我到罗马尼亚去参加第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节。在会上，各国代表都热烈地拥抱我们，欢迎我们。我在国内时也总说我们的祖国伟大，但从没有这回感觉得这么具体。他们为什么这样爱我们，尊敬我们呢？就因为我们对保卫世界和平的事业作了贡献。资本主义国家的代表们说：世界上最凶恶的是美帝国主义，但是美帝国主义被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打败了。朝鲜代表拥抱着我们，流着泪感谢我们，说永远也忘不了伟大的中国人民对朝鲜的帮助。当时我们都感动得哭了。我心里想：如果我们能炼出更多更好的钢，不就更能保卫住和平了么！今年学习了总路线，我们对钢的重要性认识得更明确了。要建设社会主义，我们炼钢厂是最重要的部门。我们炼的钢越多，建设社会主义的力量就越大；我们炼得越快，国家工业化的速度也就越快。——我们炼每一炉钢都是为了保卫世界和平，为了建设社会主义，这就是我们干活为什么总是这么有劲的缘故。我和我们炉子上的全体同志商量过了，我们向祖国向毛主席提出保证：在今年第二季度，我们不但要保持快速炼钢的炉数，而且质量方面也要超过第一季的水平。第一季度我们的成本计划没有完成，这个缺点也一定要在第二季度里补救过来。（附图片）
