Herdsmen in Darhan Muminggan United Banner, Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are now intensively engaged in livestock lambing and nursing work. By mid-March, a quarter of the banner's sheep and goats had given birth; cattle and camels and other large livestock have also begun calving and lambing.

The concentration of the lambing period is a new feature of this year's animal husbandry production. Last year, 80 percent of the banner's herdsmen, due to the adoption of separate grazing of breeding rams and ewes, and regular mating, this spring's lambing period is concentrated in a month or more after mid-February, which is easy to nurse. This important reform in production avoids the serious mortality caused by random mating in the past, resulting in early lambing, long lambing period (half a year), causing lambs to freeze to death, starve to death, have diarrhea, and ewes to miscarry.

This year, in order to strive for a net increase rate of 23 percent for all kinds of livestock, herdsmen in various places are working day and night with joy. When livestock are breeding, herdsmen often clean the sheds and pens, and spread warm and soft dry grass and dry manure in the sheds to prevent miscarriage of pregnant animals and diarrhea of lambs. Many herders in various Nuruu (districts) have managed to graze castrated sheep and ewes separately and separate the flocks for lambing. During the day, herders pay special attention to pregnant ewes, take lambing felt bags with them for grazing, and keep ewes about to give birth at home for feeding. At night, herdsmen take turns on night duty to prevent newborn young animals from being crushed or frozen to death. During the lambing period, most cadres of the Nuruu go deep into the herders' households to specifically lead the lambing and nursing work. All thirty-one veterinary cadres and local veterinarians in the banner have also gone to various pastoral areas to provide timely animal husbandry and veterinary technical guidance and treat temporary illnesses of livestock. The Taoketaole Animal Husbandry Production Mutual Aid Team in the First Nuruu has divided all its labor force into lambing, feeding, and watering livestock groups in order to ensure the healthy survival of young animals; castrated sheep and ewes are grazed separately, and measures for preventing diarrhea in young animals have also been formulated.

### 内蒙古达茂联合旗牧民紧张进行接羔保育

    内蒙古达茂联合旗牧民紧张进行接羔保育
    内蒙古自治区乌兰察布盟达茂联合旗牧民，现正紧张地进行着牲畜接羔保育工作。到三月中旬为止，全旗已有四分之一的绵、山羊下羔；牛和骆驼等大牲畜也开始下犊、下羔。
    接羔期的集中，是今年牧业生产上的新的特点。去年全旗百分之八十的牧民，由于采取了种公羊与母羊分群放牧，定期交配，今春接羔期集中在易于保育的二月中旬以后的一个多月里。这一生产上的重要改革，避免了过去因乱交乱配，造成早下羔、接羔期长（半年），致使羊羔冻死、饿死、下痢及母羊流产等严重死亡现象的发生。
    今年全旗为争取各种牲畜的纯增殖率达到百分之二十三，各地牧民都满怀喜悦的心情，日夜不停歇地劳动着。当牲畜繁殖的时候，各地牧民经常打扫棚圈，在圈棚内铺暖而软的干草和干粪末，以防母畜受凉流产和羊羔下痢。各努图克（区）不少牧户都做到了羯羊与母羊分群放牧，拨群接羔。白天牧工特别注意怀胎的母畜，都带接羔毡袋出去放牧，对将要临产的母羊，就留在家里喂养。夜间牧民轮流下夜，防止新生幼畜被压死或冻死。在接羔期中，各努图克干部大部深入牧户，具体领导接羔保育工作。全旗还有三十一名兽医干部和地方兽医，也都到各个牧区，及时进行畜牧兽医技术指导，医治牲畜临时发生的疾病。第一努图克陶克陶勒牧业生产互助组，为保证幼畜健壮成活，将全部劳动力分成接羔、喂羔、饮牲畜等小组；羯羊与母羊分群放牧，还订出了预防幼畜下痢办法。
