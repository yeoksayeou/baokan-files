Lhasa and Xigaze Youths of All Nationalities Actively Prepare to Celebrate "May Fourth" Youth Day

	Youths of all ethnic groups in Lhasa and Xigaze are actively carrying out various preparatory activities to celebrate the "May Fourth" Youth Day. Members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association will collectively join the All-China Youth Federation in Lhasa this "May Fourth"; the Xigaze Patriotic Youth Cultural Association will also be officially established on "May Fourth."

	The preparatory committee for the Lhasa "May Fourth" celebration meeting has been established and is carrying out preparations for the "Great Motherland" photo exhibition and garden party. Every afternoon, many young people gather in the parks to rehearse various recreational programs. Tibetan youths in Xigaze are also rushing to rehearse a "Patriotic and Anti-Imperialist" drama and other song and dance programs. They have launched a surge of writing letters of condolence to the soldiers and civilians constructing the Kangzang Highway. Currently, Tibetan and Hui youths in both regions are actively practicing ball sports techniques, preparing to hold friendly matches with the youth soldiers of the People's Liberation Army during the festival.

Develop Milk Processing Industry in Pastoral Areas

	The Dairy Products Company of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Cooperative Union recently dispatched a large number of personnel to Horqin League, Xilingol League, Chahar League, Yeke Juu League, Ulanqab League and other places to investigate milk source conditions. It is preparing to establish a number of milk processing factories in the leagues to transport processed milk to the interior to meet the increasing needs of the people.

	Before liberation, most of the milk produced on the grasslands, except for a portion consumed by herdsmen, was wasted. After the establishment of processing factories, this waste can be avoided, and the surplus milk can be processed into casein, lactose, milk powder, and cream.

	The establishment of dairy processing plants has also improved the lives of herders. In the past, herdsmen mainly relied on selling livestock and furs to maintain their livelihoods. Now, herdsmen can also rely on selling milk to make a living. For example, herdsman Nima of the Baiyintohai Sumu of Solon Banner in Hulunbuir League has four dairy cows, and the proceeds from selling 20 kilograms of milk per day can support his family of five for three days.

Farmers of All Nationalities in Nuomao Lake Strive for a Bumper Harvest

	The Nuomao Lake area has fertile land. It is located within the Hami Prefecture of Xinjiang Province. Uyghur, Han, Hui, and Uzbek people live here.

	This year, farmers of all nationalities generally completed spring plowing preparations twenty days early. Every day, as soon as the sun rose, people urged their livestock to transport cart after cart of manure to the fields. Previously, farmers followed ancient farming methods, without fertilization, weeding, or seed selection. Therefore, the average yield per mu was very low.

	Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have led the minority nationalities in the Nuomao Lake area towards a new life: teaching them new farming techniques, providing necessary production funds, and leading them to gradually embark on the new road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Last year, the average yield of wheat per mu was 290 jin. This year, they proposed: "To serve the country's socialist industrialization and produce more grain." They plan to harvest 300 jin of grain per mu.

Trial Planting of Various Vegetables on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

	The agricultural experimental farm established by the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the western suburbs of Lhasa City will continue to trial plant more than fifty kinds of crops and various vegetables this year. Among the crops trial planted this year, in addition to various crops that have been successfully trial planted last year, there are also sesame, tea trees, etc. The trial planting area will be expanded by one-fifth compared to last year.

	Currently, the experimental farm is carrying out seedling work. Seedlings of eggplant, chili peppers, and other vegetables grown using the "forcing cultivation method" have emerged, and chives, spinach, and other vegetables are already edible. More than twenty varieties of winter wheat sown last winter have become a green expanse. A greenhouse has recently been built to cultivate various vegetables using the "forcing cultivation method."

Gospel for the Korean People of Yanbian

	Yanji City, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, recently established a hospital - Yanbian Hospital. This is a hospital with modern equipment, divided into internal medicine and surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, dentistry, and a radiology department and an acupuncture room.

	Doctors and staff warmly receive people of fraternal nationalities who come to see a doctor, and patiently treat them to help them quickly restore their health.

	Yanbian Hospital not only undertakes general treatment tasks, but also absorbs students from the Yanbian University School of Medicine for internships, so that their theoretical learning is closely integrated with clinical practice.

The First Normal School for the Li and Miao Peoples of Hainan

	A junior normal school established by the People's Government of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region has recently opened. The first batch of fifty students selected from various counties have begun a happy learning life.

	After liberation, thanks to the care of the Party and the People's Government, primary school education in the Li and Miao Autonomous Region has greatly developed. In order to further develop the people's education in the autonomous region, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government allocated more than 1.27 billion yuan to establish this normal school. This is the first normal school for the Li and Miao peoples of Hainan, which will play a great role in cultivating teachers for the Li and Miao peoples, running primary school education well throughout the region, and improving the culture of the Li and Miao peoples.

The Yao People of Xishan Love "The People Sent by Chairman Mao"

	Xishan, Donglan County, Guangxi Province, is an old revolutionary base area. The Yao people who live here suffered from poverty and disease in the past due to the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. After liberation, the Yao Autonomous Region People's Government established a health center here. However, because the area is vast and the mountain roads are difficult to travel, the Yao people cannot all go to the health center for diagnosis and treatment when they are sick. Health worker Huang Xiulian and doctor Huang Hanju carried medicines over the mountains, going from village to village, touring to treat the masses.

	Wherever the comrades of the health center go, the local people welcome them in groups as if celebrating a happy event. The Yao people in Xiangyou, Nongfeng, and other townships published wall newspapers before the doctors arrived; elementary school students beat waist drums when the doctors entered the village. People call the doctors "the people sent by Chairman Mao."

Curing Danba Dengzhu's Horse

	The family of Tibetan Danba Dengzhu felt unhappy because their horse was seriously ill and had not drunk water or eaten grass for several days. Someone told Danba Dengzhu: "The Lhasa Livestock Clinic can treat it, take the horse there and try!"

	He took the horse to the livestock clinic. After careful examination by the veterinarian, surgery was immediately performed to puncture the intestines. A day later, the horse's acute pneumatosis intestinalis disease was cured.

	How happy Danba Dengzhu was! He presented a Hada to the doctor and said gratefully: "My mother's illness was cured by the Lhasa People's Hospital, and my sick horse was cured by you. Chairman Mao cares about the Tibetan people everywhere!"

    在祖国各族人民的大家庭里
    拉萨和日喀则的各族青年积极筹备庆祝“五四”青年节
    拉萨、日喀则各族各界青年积极进行庆祝“五四”青年节的各种筹备活动。拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会的会员们将在今年“五四”在拉萨集体参加中华全国民主青年联合会；日喀则市爱国青年文化联谊会也将在“五四”正式成立。
    拉萨市庆祝“五四”大会筹备会已经成立，正在进行“伟大祖国”图片展览和游园会的各项筹备工作。每天下午，很多青年集体在林卡里排练各种游艺节目。日喀则市藏族青年也正在赶排一个“爱国反帝”的话剧和其他歌舞节目，他们已经掀起了给修筑康藏公路的军工和民工写慰问信的热潮。现在两地的藏、回族青年正在积极练习球类技术，准备在节日里和人民解放军的青年战士举行友谊赛。
    发展牧区的牛奶加工事业
    内蒙古自治区合作社联合社乳品公司，最近派出大批人员分赴哲里木盟、锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟、伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟等地调查奶源情况，准备在各盟建立若干牛奶加工工厂，把经过加工后的牛奶运到内地，以满足人民日益增长的需要。
    解放前，草地上出产的牛奶，除一部分供牧民食用外，大部分都被蹧蹋。加工工厂成立后，就可以避免这种浪费现象，把剩余的牛奶加工成为酪胶、乳糖、奶粉、奶油。
    乳品加工厂的建立，也相应地改善了牧民的生活。过去，牧民主要依靠出卖牲畜和皮毛来维持生活，现在，牧民也可以依靠出售牛奶来维持生活。如呼纳盟索伦旗白音托海苏木牧民尼玛，有四条乳牛，每天用出售二十公斤牛奶的所得，就可供全家五口人吃三天。
    淖毛湖各族农民争取丰收
    淖毛湖地区土地肥沃，它在新疆省哈密专区境内。这里聚居着维吾尔族、汉族、回族和乌兹别克族人民。
    今年，各族农民普遍提早二十天做好了春耕准备工作。每天太阳刚刚露头，人们就吆喝着牲口，把一车车的大粪往地里送。以前，农民们沿习古老的耕作方法，不施肥，不锄草，不选种。因此，每亩地的平均收获量很低。
    解放以后，党和人民政府领导淖毛湖地区的少数民族人民走向新的生活：教他们学习新的耕作技术，贷给必要的生产资金，又领导他们逐步走互助合作的新道路。去年每亩小麦的平均产量为二百九十市斤。今年，他们提出：“要为国家社会主义工业化服务，生产更多的粮食。”计划每亩地打三百斤粮食。
    康藏高原上试种各种蔬菜
    中国人民解放军西藏军区在拉萨市西郊建立的农业试验场，今年将继续试种五十多种作物和各种蔬菜。今年试种的作物中，除去年已经试种成功的各种作物外，还有芝麻、茶树等。试种面积将较去年扩大五分之一。
    现在，试验场正在进行育苗工作。用“促成栽培法”种植的茄子、辣椒等蔬菜的幼苗已经出土，韭菜、菠菜等已可食用。去年冬天播种的二十多种品种的冬小麦，已成一片油绿。最近还修建了一所温室，准备用“促成栽培法”栽培各种蔬菜。
    延边朝鲜族人民的福音
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区的延吉市，最近建立了一所医院——延边医院。这是一所有着近代设备的医院，内分设内科和外科、妇产科、小儿科、耳鼻科、眼科、齿科以及放射线科和一个针灸室。
    医师和工作人员，热诚地接待前来看病的兄弟民族人民，耐心地给他们进行治疗，使他们迅速恢复健康。
    延边医院不仅担负一般的治疗任务，还吸收延边大学医学院的同学实习，使他们的理论学习与临床实践密切结合起来。
    海南黎族苗族人民的第一所师范学校
    海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府开办的一所初级师范学校，已在最近开学。第一批由各县选送入学的五十名学生，已经开始了愉快的学习生活。
    解放后，由于党和人民政府的关怀，黎族苗族自治区的小学教育，已有很大的发展。为进一步发展自治区的人民教育事业，广东省人民政府又拨款十二亿七千多万元兴办这所师范学校。这是海南黎族苗族人民的第一所师范学校，对今后培养黎族、苗族人民的师资，办好全区的小学教育，提高黎族苗族人民的文化，将起很大的作用。
    西山瑶族人民热爱“毛主席派来的人”
    广西省的东兰县西山是革命老根据地。生活在这里的瑶族人民，过去由于国民党反动统治的压迫，贫病交迫。解放后，瑶族自治区人民政府在这里成立了卫生所。但因地区辽阔，山路难行，瑶族人民有了病，不能都到卫生所去诊治。卫生员黄秀莲和医生黄汉举便挑着药品越过高山，从这个村到那个村，巡回给群众治病。
    卫生所的同志每到一处，当地人民像办喜事一样，成群结队地欢迎他们。央佑、弄峰等乡的瑶族人民在医生来到以前，曾出版了墙报；小学生们在医生进村时，打着腰鼓。人们把医生称做“毛主席派来的人”。
    把旦巴邓珠的马治好了
    藏民旦巴邓珠一家人都感到不愉快，因为他们的马有了重病，好几天没有喝水吃草了。有人告诉旦巴邓珠：“拉萨市家畜门诊所会治疗，把马牵去试试吧！”
    他把马送到家畜门诊所。兽医进行仔细检查以后，立刻施行穿肠手术。一天以后，马的急性风气疝病就给治好了。
    旦巴邓珠是多么高兴啊，他给医生献了哈达，并感激地说：“我母亲的病是拉萨市人民医院给治好的，我的病马是你们给治好的。毛主席处处关心藏族人民！”
