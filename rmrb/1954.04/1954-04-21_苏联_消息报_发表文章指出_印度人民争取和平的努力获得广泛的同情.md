Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The "Izvestia" newspaper published an article by A. Pronin on the 18th, entitled "The Indian People's Contribution to Peace."

The author wrote: The Indian people are justified in being concerned about the security of their country. The purpose of the United States' policy of establishing military blocs in the Near and Middle East is to turn this vast region into a springboard for a new world war.

American interference in Indochina affairs, connivance with the Kuomintang bandits in Burma, and unwillingness to establish a firm peace in Korea are threats to the Indian people and other peace-loving people in Asia. This policy of the United States is clearly contrary to the wishes of the Indian people to eliminate colonialism in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world.

The Indian public firmly supports the convening of the Geneva Conference and strives to achieve lasting peace in Asia and to fight for the freedom and independence of all Asian people.

The firm attitude of the Indian public on the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is known to the world. In view of the upcoming Geneva Conference, the Indian public is stepping up its demands to allow the People's Republic of China to participate in all international institutions.

The movement of the Indian people demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction is growing, which proves the urgent desire of the Indian people to achieve peace and ease international tensions.

Pronin said: The United States' conspiracy to pit the Indian people against other Asian people has failed. The author discussed the issue of India and Pakistan in this regard, saying that the vast majority of the Indian people believe that these issues can only be resolved by India and Pakistan without interference from other countries. Facts show that the people of Pakistan are equally willing to have friendly mutual relations with the people of India.

The demand for strengthening peace and ensuring security is forming a practical and effective force in India. This force unites and unites all those who cherish the vital interests of their country and people. India has some urgent problems related to the interests of the entire country that need to be resolved, including developing the national economy, effectively using national resources for the benefit of the country, increasing the material well-being of the people, and increasing the people's purchasing power. Lasting peace, security, and peaceful labor are the basic prerequisites and conditions for solving these important problems. Precisely for this reason, the Indian people demand peace and the security of their country. The Indian people's demand for peace vividly illustrates the growth of the movement of Asian people to safeguard peace and oppose turning Asian countries into springboards for a new world war.

Pronin concluded that, undoubtedly, in the arduous and complex work of strengthening peace, the Indian people will, as before, receive the sincere sympathy and support of all progressive humanity.

    苏联“消息报”发表文章指出
    印度人民争取和平的努力获得广泛的同情
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“消息报”十八日刊载了阿·普罗宁写的一篇文章，题目是“印度人民对和平的贡献”。
    作者写道：印度人民对于他们的国家的安全感到忧虑是很有理由的。美国在中近东建立军事集团政策的目的，就是要把这个广大地区变成新的世界战争的跳板。
    美国干涉印度支那事务、纵容在缅甸的国民党匪帮、不愿意在朝鲜确立稳固的和平，这些行径是对印度人民以及亚洲的其他爱好和平人民的威胁。美国的这种政策显然是和印度人民希望消灭亚洲、非洲以及各地的殖民主义的愿望相对立的。
    印度公众坚决支持召开日内瓦会议，并为实现亚洲的持久和平、争取全亚洲人民的自由和独立而努力。
    印度公众在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利问题上的坚决态度，是举世皆知的。鉴于日内瓦会议就要召开，印度公众正加紧要求让中华人民共和国参加所有国际机构。
    印度人民要求取缔原子武器、细菌武器以及其他大规模毁灭性的武器的运动正日益壮大，这证明了印度人民要实现和平和缓和国际紧张局势的迫切愿望。
    普罗宁说：美国想使印度人民和其他亚洲人民对立的阴谋已经失败了。作者就这方面论及印度和巴基斯坦问题说：广大的印度人民相信这些问题只能由印度和巴基斯坦在没有其他国家干涉的情况下来解决。事实说明巴基斯坦人民同样愿意和印度人民有友好的相互关系。
    加强和平和保障安全的要求正在印度形成一种实际而有效的力量。这种力量团结和联合了所有珍视他们国家和人民的切身利益的人们。印度有一些关系到整个国家利益的迫切需要解决的问题，这些问题包括发展国民经济、有效地利用国家的资源为国家造福、增进人民的物质福利和提高人民的购买力。持久和平、安全与和平劳动是解决这些重要问题的基本前提和条件。正因为如此，印度人民才要求和平和他们国家的安全。印度人民要求和平的意志生动地说明了亚洲人民维护和平与反对把亚洲国家变成新的世界战争的跳板的运动的壮大。
    普罗宁最后说，无疑的，在加强和平这一艰巨和复杂的工作中，印度人民将和以前一样得到所有进步人类的诚挚的同情和支持。
