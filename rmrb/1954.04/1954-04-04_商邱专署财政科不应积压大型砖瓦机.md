Letters from readers Xie Shuzhang and Yuan Dengyun: In October 1951, the Finance Section of the Shangqiu Special District in Henan Province purchased a large brick and tile machine in Qingdao for 150 million yuan; however, after it was bought back, it could not be installed and used because the geological conditions were not suitable. It has been nearly two and a half years, and this machine is still idle in the directly subordinate warehouse of the Shangqiu Special District Grain Bureau. Because the warehouse is damp and has been unattended for a long time, the machine has not only rusted, but also lost some parts due to several moves. When the Shangqiu Municipal Finance and Economic Committee organized relevant departments to inspect the work of the grain depot, it discovered this problem and made several suggestions, but the leaders of the Finance Section consistently ignored it. We believe that the department's behavior of blindly purchasing machinery, resulting in hoarding and wasting state property, should be strictly criticized. It is recommended that the Finance Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government immediately conduct an inspection and handle this matter.

    商邱专署财政科不应积压大型砖瓦机
    读者谢树章、袁登云来信：一九五一年十月间，河南省商邱专署财政科以一亿五千万元在青岛购买大型砖瓦机一部；但买回后因为地质条件不适合，不能安装使用。至今将近二年半了，这部机器还在商邱专署粮食局直属仓库里闲放着。因为仓地潮湿，又长期无人照料，现在机器不但生了锈，而且由于几次搬动而丢失了一些零件。商邱市财政经济委员会组织有关部门检查粮库工作时，曾发现了这个问题，并数次提出意见，但财政科领导同志始终置之不理。我们认为该科这种盲目采购机器，以致造成积压和浪费国家财产的行为，应该受到严格的批评。建议河南省人民政府财政厅立即对这件事进行检查和处理。
