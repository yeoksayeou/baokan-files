Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The basic-level election work in Jiangxi Province has been successfully completed by the end of March. Nearly ten thousand basic-level units under the jurisdiction of eighty-two counties, six cities, and the Lushan Special District in the province have established basic-level political power under the People's Congress system.

    After the basic-level election work in Jiangxi Province was launched in batches in early June of last year, seventeen million people across the province participated in the election activities with high political enthusiasm. According to statistics from 239 townships in 14 counties, including Ruijin, Xingguo, Suichuan, Yiyang, Tonggu, Xinyu, and Dongxiang, the voter turnout generally reached about 90% of the total number of voters. In the Jinggang Mountain area, the cradle of the revolution, the average voter turnout in basic-level units reached 99.8%. The aquatic residents who frequent the Gan River and Poyang Lake also actively exercised their democratic rights. Many aquatic voters sailing outside came back from hundreds of miles away to participate in the election, or sent their ballots back to entrust relatives and friends to put them into the ballot box.

    In the basic-level elections in various parts of Jiangxi Province, a large number of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, agricultural production cooperative directors, and industrial labor models, who were called "socialist leaders" by the voters, were elected as people's representatives with extremely high votes. In the counties under the jurisdiction of the Central Revolutionary Base Area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, many former workers of the worker-peasant democratic government, veteran Red Army soldiers and families of Red Army revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary soldiers were elected to the basic-level political power to directly participate in the management of state affairs.

    Due to the election of these outstanding figures, the connection between the broad masses of the people and the basic-level political power has become closer. Many people's representatives in counties such as Poyang and Yongxiu often go deep into the masses during their work or production spare time, take the initiative to collect opinions and requirements of voters, and use them as the basis for improving government work. The people in various places are more actively putting forward various beneficial criticisms and suggestions to the government and cadres to help the government improve its work. According to incomplete statistics from 35 townships and towns in Hengfeng, Hukou, Dean, and Dongxiang counties, and the Pingxiang coal mining area, more than 3,400 criticisms and suggestions from the people have been received since the end of the basic-level elections, most of which are related to production and improving the leadership style of government workers. The basic-level political powers in various places have made serious efforts to handle the criticisms and suggestions from the people. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    江西省基层选举工作胜利完成
    全省建立了人民代表大会制度的基层政权
    江西省基层选举工作已在三月底全部胜利完成。全省八十二个县、六个市和庐山特别区所辖的近一万个基层单位，都已经建立了人民代表大会制度的基层政权。
    江西省基层选举工作从去年六月初分批展开后，全省一千七百万人民都以高度的政治热情参加了选举活动。据瑞金、兴国、遂川、弋阳、铜鼓、新喻、东乡等十四个县的二百三十九个乡统计，参加选举的选民一般都达到选民总数的百分之九十左右。革命摇篮井冈山区各基层单位选民参加选举的比例平均达到百分之九十九点八。常年来往在赣江、鄱阳湖中的水上居民，也积极地行使了自己的民主权利。许多航行在外面的水上选民都从几百里外赶回来参加选举，或者把自己的选票寄回来委托亲友投入票箱。
    在江西省各地基层选举中，被选民们称为“社会主义带头人”的大批共产党员、青年团员、农业生产合作社社长和工业劳动模范们都以极高的票数当选为人民代表。第二次国内革命战争时期的中央革命根据地所属各县，很多以前工农民主政府的工作人员、老红军战士和红军革命烈士家属、革命军人家属被选举到基层政权中，直接参加管理国家事务。
    由于这些优秀人物的当选，更加密切了广大人民群众和基层政权之间的联系。鄱阳、永修等县许多人民代表，经常在工作或生产余暇时间深入群众，主动搜集选民的意见和要求，作为改进政府工作的依据。各地人民群众更加积极地向政府和干部提出各种有益的批评和建议，帮助政府改进工作。据横峰、湖口、德安、东乡等县的三十五个乡、镇和萍乡煤矿区不完全统计，基层选举结束后，来自人民群众中的批评和建议已达三千四百多件，其中绝大部分都是有关生产和改进政府工作人员领导作风的。各地基层政权接到人民群众的批评、建议后，都做了认真的处理。　（据新华社讯）
