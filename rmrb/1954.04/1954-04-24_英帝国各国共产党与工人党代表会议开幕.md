Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd - TASS reports: A conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of the British Empire opened in London on April 21st.

    The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Harry Pollitt, delivered the opening address, welcoming the delegates.

    The Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Palme Dutt, gave a political report. Dutt pointed out the unprecedented upsurge of national liberation movements against imperialism. He described in detail the struggles of the people of colonies and semi-colonies for national independence and spoke of the increasingly intensified expansion of American imperialism after the war.

    Dutt emphasized that the struggle for peace is extremely important because American imperialism is threatening to expand the scope of its unjust wars against colonial peoples. He called for a struggle to withdraw British troops from British Guiana, Egypt, Sudan, Cyprus and other countries, appealed for solidarity with the oppressed peoples in their struggle for independence against American and British imperialism, and called on the Communist and Workers' Parties to unite in this struggle.

    At the afternoon session on the 21st, representatives of parties from some colonies and autonomous territories spoke.

    The editor of the "Malay Mail", representative He. Bu. Lin, revealed in his speech the real reason why British imperialism is waging war in Malaya for the benefit of rubber giants, and reported to the delegates on the heroic struggle of the Malayan people for independence. He called for an end to all colonial wars and the lifting of the state of emergency and all political restrictions declared in the colonies.

    Billy Strachan of the West Indies emphasized that the people of the West Indies are intensifying their struggle for independence and have already accumulated certain experience in the struggle.

    Myers of the Communist Party of Australia spoke of the intensified penetration of American imperialism into Australia. He pointed out that due to American pressure, the Australian people are bearing an unbearable burden of armaments. Myers said that Australia is on the eve of parliamentary elections, and he called on the working people to form a united front to oppose the Menzies government. Dilip Bose of the Communist Party of India spoke of the growing ties between the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of Great Britain. He said that the Indian peace movement is a fortress of democratic forces in India and is inseparable from the struggle for democracy and against imperialism.
