Xinhua News Agency, Changdu, 9th. The People's Liberation Army soldiers constructing the Kangzang Highway, with feelings of reluctance to part, bid farewell to the representatives of the comfort delegation, and asked their relatives to convey their determination to build the highway to Lhasa to Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country.

Soldiers braved strong winds and heavy snow from distant camps, rushing to the representatives' residences or climbing onto the cars carrying the representatives, handing over their oaths and letters of determination. One snowy night, soldier Ma Qiang walked five miles in the dark to the representatives' residence to deliver a letter expressing his determination. The letter said: Dear Chairman Mao, we will certainly follow your instructions, defend the border well and build the highway well. The famous "Pioneer Pathfinder" and first-class merit recipient of road construction, Cui Ximing, said: In the future, we will conquer more high mountains and floods, and build the Kangzang Highway to Lhasa as soon as possible. Miao soldier and Youth League member Ma Lao Si is determined to learn from the spirit of hero Huang Jiguang and actively participate in the construction of the motherland's border areas. The "Plateau Model Cooking Class" of the 4th Company of a certain unit presented their homemade soy sauce to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the people of the whole country.

    修筑康藏公路的战士送别慰问团
    决心把公路早日修到拉萨去
    【新华社昌都九日电】修筑康藏公路的人民解放军战士们，怀着难分难舍的心情送别慰问团代表的时候，纷纷托亲人把他们坚决把公路修到拉萨去的决心，带给毛主席和全国人民。
    战士们从遥远的营地冒着大风大雪，赶到代表们的住处或是攀上载着代表正在行进的汽车，交来他们的誓词和决心书。一个飘着雪花的深夜，战士马强摸黑走了五里路到代表们的住所送上写着他的决心的信件。信上说：亲爱的毛主席，我们一定听从你的嘱托，守卫好边疆、修好公路。著名的“探路先锋”、筑路一等功臣崔锡明说：今后我们要征服更多的高山和洪水，把康藏公路早日修到拉萨去。苗族战士、青年团团员马老四决心学习英雄黄继光的精神，积极参加祖国边疆的建设事业。某部四连“高原模范炊事班”向毛主席、朱总司令和全国人民献出他们自制的酱油。
