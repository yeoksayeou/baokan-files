    CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee Holds Symposium to Exchange Experience and Research
    [Our Newspaper] The Rural Work Department of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee convened a symposium on the work of agricultural production cooperatives in late March to discuss issues such as consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives and strengthening leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Dozens of people attended the meeting, including directors of county party committee offices and secretaries of some key district party committees.
    Songjiang Province originally had 780 old cooperatives, which were reorganized and merged into 770, increasing the number of cooperative members by more than 3,600 households. More than 1,800 new cooperatives were built this year, exceeding the original plan by 33 percent. Seventy-three villages and 146 settlements in the province have basically achieved cooperation, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 7.15 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. Due to the large number and rapid development of cooperatives, the leadership strength cannot keep up, and it often loses sight of the other. As a result, some cooperatives' production plans are not carefully formulated, and the organization of labor is not meticulous enough. These situations were studied at the symposium, and experiences were exchanged.
    The meeting believed that the primary task at present is to shift the leadership strength to consolidation and improvement. It is necessary to mobilize cooperative members to formulate or revise practical and feasible production development plans, further improve farming techniques, and tap potential in large quantities; at the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of labor and the calculation of labor in order to promote and improve labor productivity; grasp the ideological situation of the masses and carry out education in a timely manner. Secondly, we should further implement the policy of running the cooperatives well, driving the groups, and comprehensively promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Cooperatives should help farmers outside the cooperatives in terms of technology and materials, and closely link the relationship between groups and cooperatives through the mutual aid and cooperation network. The leadership must also help solve specific problems and consolidate and improve mutual aid groups. Thirdly, it is necessary to improve the level of leadership and strengthen the leadership of the district party committees, with the district as the unit to establish points and divide areas, so as to combine points and areas, and convene mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings on time to solve problems and exchange experience.

    中共松江省委开座谈会交流经验研究情况
    【本报讯】中共松江省委农村工作部在三月下旬召开了农业生产合作社工作座谈会，讨论巩固提高农业生产合作社和加强对互助合作运动的领导等问题。参加会议的有各县县委办公室主任及部分重点区区委书记等数十人。
    松江省原有七百八十个老社，经整顿、合并成七百七十个，增加社员三千六百多户。今年新建社一千八百多个，超过原计划百分之三十三。全省已有七十三个村和一百四十六个屯基本上达到合作化，全省入社农户占总农户百分之七点一五。由于合作社发展得多、发展得快，领导力量赶不上，常会顾此失彼。因而有些社生产计划订得不够周密，组织劳动不够细致。座谈会上对这些情况都进行了研究，并互相交流了经验。
    会议认为，目前首先应把领导力量转移到巩固提高方面来。要发动社员制订或修订切实可行的发展生产计划，进一步改进耕作技术，大量挖掘潜力；同时要加强组织劳动和计算劳动的工作，以促进和提高劳动生产效率；掌握群众思想情况，及时进行教育。其次，应进一步贯彻办好社、带动组，全面推动互助合作运动的方针。合作社要在技术上物质上帮助社外农民，通过互助合作联系网密切组社关系，领导上还必须帮助解决具体问题，巩固提高互助组。再次，必须提高领导水平，加强区委的领导，以区为单位建点划片，做到点面结合，按时召开互助合作代表会，解决问题、交流经验。
