    Ministry of Railways Convenes National Railway Work Conference
    This Year's Decision to Strengthen Transportation Organization and Exploit Latent Potential
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government convened the 1954 National Railway Work Conference. The conference decided that the central task for the railways this year is to strengthen transportation organization and tap the latent potential of the railways.
    Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan delivered a report at the meeting, providing a basic summary of the work in 1953 and outlining the work arrangements for 1954. Last year, railway workers across the country overfulfilled the state's transportation plan and the production increase and economy drive plan. Freight transport completed 112.9% of the plan; passenger transport completed 127.8% of the plan; transportation cost per converted ton-kilometer decreased by 18.5% compared to the plan; labor productivity completed 125.1% of the plan; profits and basic depreciation submitted exceeded the plan, and the basic construction plan was also nearing completion. According to the state's plan, this year's railway freight transport will be 115.5% of that in 1953 (excluding narrow gauge); passenger transport will be 114% of that in 1953. Basic construction investment, used to strengthen existing railways and locomotives and rolling stock, will be 143% of that in 1953. The national railway equipment overhaul plan is 136.1% of that in 1953. Transportation cost per converted ton-kilometer will be 97.2% of that in 1953, and labor productivity will be 118.7% of that in 1953.
    The meeting studied the current basic situation of the railways and the basic tasks for the future. The meeting believes that with the development of national construction, railway transport volume will grow significantly, but the progress of current railway work is not keeping pace with the growth rate of transportation needs. According to the general task of the state during the transition period and the current basic situation of the railways, the basic tasks of the railways should be: With the development of the national economy, correspondingly develop railway transport so that it can meet the growing transportation needs of industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, and the people's material and cultural life, and guarantee national defense needs. To this end, it is necessary to conduct technical transformation of China's railways in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with the advanced standards of socialist Soviet railways; it is necessary to always attach importance to the maintenance and repair of railway fixed assets and maintain the good condition of railway technical equipment; it is necessary to build new railways and connect more regions of the country into a whole in terms of politics, economy, military affairs, and culture; it is necessary to continuously improve business management and fully utilize the potential capacity of equipment; it is necessary to train a large number of cadres who master new technologies and unite, educate, and transform the original technical personnel, in order to catch up with the existing advanced technical level of Soviet railways within a considerable period and serve the country's socialist construction.
    The meeting discussed the technical transformation of the railways and the issue of tapping the potential of existing equipment. The meeting believes that the potential of existing railways is great, and it is necessary to tap the potential to complete the tasks. However, tapping potential must oppose the brute force method of "living off old capital." In order to ensure the completion of the 1954 national transportation plan, the meeting stipulated that all employees must be organized to study the Soviet Union and learn from and promote the experience of the China Changchun Railway, implement planned management, focus on transportation organization, and accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, to strive for the high-quality completion of the national plan. The meeting also specifically stipulated the ten main tasks of the national railways.
    The meeting believes that: In order to complete the transportation tasks, it is also necessary to strengthen the unity of all cadres, strengthen the unity of all railway workers, and strengthen the unity of railways and other departments. This meeting was held from March 29th to April 2nd.

    铁道部召开全国铁路工作会议
    今年决定加强运输组织工作发挥潜在力量
    【新华社十九日讯】　中央人民政府铁道部召开了一九五四年全国铁路工作会议。会议决定今年铁路的中心工作是加强运输组织工作，发挥铁路的潜在力量。
    铁道部滕代远部长在会上作了一九五三年工作的基本总结和一九五四年工作部署的报告。全国铁路职工去年超额完成了国家运输计划和增产节约计划。运送货物完成计划百分之一百一十二·九；输送旅客完成计划百分之一百二十七·八；运输成本每换算吨公里比计划降低了百分之十八·五；劳动生产率完成计划百分之一百二十五·一；上缴利润和基本折旧都超过了计划，基本建设计划也接近完成。根据国家的计划，今年铁路运送货物为一九五三年的百分之一百一十五·五（窄轨不在内）；输送旅客为一九五三年的百分之一百一十四。基本建设计划，用于加强现有铁路及机车车辆的投资，为一九五三年的百分之一百四十三。全国铁路设备大修计划。为一九五三年的百分之一百三十六点一。运输成本每换算吨公里为一九五三年的百分之九十七点二，劳动生产率为一九五三年的百分之一百一十八点七。
    会议研究了目前铁路的基本情况和今后的基本任务。会议认为，随着国家建设的发展，铁路运输量将有巨大的增长，但目前铁路工作的进展和运输需要的增长速度不相适应。根据国家过渡时期的总任务和目前铁路的基本情况，铁路的基本任务应该是：随着国民经济的发展，相应地发展铁路运输，使之能满足工农业生产、商品流通和人民物质文化生活日益增长的运输需要，并保证国防需要。为此，必须按照社会主义苏联铁路的先进标准，对我国铁路有计划地、有步骤地进行技术改造；必须经常重视铁路固定资产的养护维修工作，保持铁路技术设备的良好状态；必须修筑新铁路，在政治、经济、军事、文化各方面，把国家更多的地区连成为一个整体；必须不断改善经营管理，充分发挥设备的潜在能力；必须培养掌握新技术的大批干部，并团结、教育、改造原有技术人员，以期在一个相当长的时期内赶上苏联铁路现有的先进技术水平，为国家社会主义建设服务。
    会议讨论了铁路的技术改造和发挥现有设备潜力问题。会议认为，现有铁路的潜力是很大的，必须发挥潜力来完成任务。但发挥潜在能力，必须反对“吃老本”的蛮干办法。为了保证完成一九五四年的国家运输计划，会议规定必须组织全体职工学习苏联和学习与推广中长路经验，贯彻计划管理，抓紧运输组织工作，加速机车车辆周转，为质量良好地完成国家计划而奋斗。会议并具体规定了全国铁路的十项主要工作。
    会议认为：为了完成运输任务，还必须加强全体干部的团结，加强全路职工的团结，加强铁路和其他部门的团结。这次会议是在三月二十九日到四月二日举行的。
