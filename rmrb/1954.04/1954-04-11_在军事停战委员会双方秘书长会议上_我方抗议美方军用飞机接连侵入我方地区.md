Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. From March 12th to April 3rd, US military aircraft violated the armistice agreement thirteen more times, flying across the military demarcation line and intruding into the airspace controlled by the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting of secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission on the 9th, the Korean-Chinese side protested to the US side regarding these thirteen incidents and demanded an explanation from the US side.

Among these thirteen intrusion incidents, the following are particularly noteworthy: Around 21:00 on the night of April 3rd, US military aircraft intruded into the airspace above the brightly lit Kaesong. Around 11:00 on March 30th, US aircraft intruded into the airspace above the headquarters area of the Military Armistice Commission twice in succession. This is clearly a provocative act by the US side.

On two occasions, US military aircraft intruded into our rear areas. One was: Around 9:00 on March 25th, a US single-engine propeller aircraft intruded into our area north of Gorampo-ri, and then flew over 100 kilometers over our deep inland areas, flying over Tusan, Xiaoxing Mountain southeast of Ichon, Jinlae-dong north of Shangganling, and other places within our area, finally flying back to the US area from the airspace above Hill 602.2 south of Kimhwa. The other was: Around 10:30 on March 12th, a US single-engine propeller aircraft intruded from the sea into the airspace above Haksan-ri southwest of Yeonan on the west coast, and then flew south over Yeonan, Seokpo-ri, and other places.

In addition to the above five incidents, the other eight incidents were:

Around 10:50 on March 16th, a US military jet aircraft intruded from due south into the airspace approximately four kilometers east of Guiseonbong southeast of Goseong, stayed for about 20 minutes, and then flew back to the US sea area.

Around 17:07 on March 16th, two US military jet aircraft intruded from the direction of Ganghwa Island into our area above the Haewol-ri area where the Ryesong River and Han River meet, and then flew south.

Around 10:55 on March 18th, a US military twin-engine propeller aircraft intruded from the direction of Chorwon into our area above Hill 527.7 south of West Fang Mountain northeast of Chorwon, and then flew east over Shangganling, Gyoyamsan, and Hill 1219.8 south of Eoeun Mountain, and then flew south.

Around 16:10 on March 19th, two US military jet aircraft intruded from due east into our area above the Gunryangsan area southeast of Kaesong, and then flew south.

Around 13:00 on March 20th, a US military jet aircraft intruded into our area above the Cheongun-dong area northeast of Songneung. It then flew over Tusan, Hwaseok-dong southwest of Ichon, Orijeong, and other places, and then flew to the US area.

Around 15:10 on March 24th, a US military jet aircraft intruded from the southeast into our area above the Duryubong area southeast of Pyonggang, and then flew towards Chorwon.

Around 15:40 on March 24th, two US military single-engine propeller aircraft intruded from the southeast into our area above Daeyahyeon-ri southeast of Kaesong, and then flew east over Hwazangsan, Wicheon-ri, and other places.

Around 10:55 on March 31st, four US military jet aircraft intruded from the southeast into our area above the Deokmul Mountain area southeast of Kaesong, and then flew southeast.

    在军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上
    我方抗议美方军用飞机接连侵入我方地区
    【新华社开城十日电】从三月十二日到四月三日，美方军用飞机又十三次违反停战协定，飞越军事分界线，侵入朝中方面控制地区上空；在九日的军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面就这十三次事件向美方提出抗议，并要求美方提出交代。
    在这十三次入侵事件中，特别值得注意的是：四月三日夜二十一时左右，美方军用飞机竟侵入灯火辉煌的开城上空。三月三十日十一时左右，美机接连两次侵入军事停战委员会总部区上空。这显然是美方的挑衅行为。
    有两次，美方军用飞机侵入我后方地区。一次是：在三月二十五日九时左右，美方军用单引擎螺旋桨飞机一架从高浪浦里以北侵入我方地区上空后，竟在我方纵深地区上空飞行了一百多公里，飞经我方地区内的兔山、伊川东南的晓星山、上甘岭以北的真莱洞等地上空，最后才从金城以南的六零二点二高地上空飞回美方地区。另一次是：在三月十二日十时三十分左右，美方军用单引擎螺旋桨飞机一架，从海面上侵入西海岸延安西南的鹤山里上空，后飞经延安、石浦里等地上空向南飞去。
    十三次事件中，除上述五次外，其他八次为：
    三月十六日十时五十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机一架，由正南方侵入我方高城东南九仙峰以东约四公里的海面上空，活动约二十分钟后，飞回美方海面上空。
    三月十六日十七时零七分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机两架，由江华岛方向侵入礼成江与汉江会合处的海月里一带我方地区上空，后向南飞去。
    三月十八日十时五十五分左右，美方军用双引擎螺旋桨飞机一架从铁原方向侵入铁原东北西方山南五二七点七高地我方地区上空，后向东飞经上甘岭、轿岩山、鱼隐山以南的一二一九点八高地等地上空，然后向南飞去。
    三月十九日十六时十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机两架，由正东方向侵入开城东南的军藏山一带我方地区上空，后向南飞去。
    三月二十日十三时左右，美方军用喷气式飞机一架，侵入朔宁东北青云洞一带我方地区上空。后飞经兔山、伊川西南的花席洞、五里亭等地上空，然后飞往美方地区。
    三月二十四日十五时十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机一架，从东南方向侵入平康东南的斗流峰一带我方地区上空，后向铁原方向飞去。
    三月二十四日十五时四十分左右，美方军用单引擎螺旋桨飞机两架，由东南方向侵入开城东南大也岘里我方地区上空，后飞经华藏山、渭川里等地上空，向东飞去。
    三月三十一日十时五十五分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机四架，由东南方向侵入开城东南德物山一带我方地区上空，后向东南飞去。
