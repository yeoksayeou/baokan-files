The nationwide factory and mine enterprise workers, inspired by the General Line, have made new progress in learning from the technological innovation experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company since the beginning of this year. Now, the tide of technological innovation has expanded from state-owned industries to local state-owned industries, from iron and steel smelting enterprises to light industry and transportation departments, and from the Northeast region to the southern border areas. According to statistics from sixteen local state-owned factories in Heilongjiang Province, from January to March this year, workers put forward a total of 684 reasonable suggestions on technological reforms and other aspects, of which 283 have been implemented. Many inventions and rationalization proposals have played a significant role in tapping the potential of enterprises. For example, in the past, Xinhua Glass Instrument Factory produced large glass bottles, and a group of fourteen people produced more than 700 bottles per day, with a waste rate as high as 11.6%. During the plan discussion this year, worker Fu Fengqi proposed using semi-mechanized molds to replace manual labor. The trial production resulted in eleven people in each group producing 1,700 bottles per day, the waste rate was reduced to 0.57%, and the unit cost was reduced from 2,900 yuan to 2,267 yuan.

Since January, workers in Yingkou City have put forward more than 2,800 reasonable suggestions, of which more than 300 belong to technological reforms. Wang Zifeng, an electrical worker at the local state-owned Liaodong Bleaching and Dyeing Factory, successfully created a wool-shearing machine, which transformed wool-shearing work from manual labor to automation, reduced the labor intensity of workers, improved product quality, and increased output by 50%.

In February, the Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions held the first industrial labor model training class in its spare time. After returning to their factories, the labor models who participated in the training class launched a technological innovation movement in each factory. Liu Shulin, a skilled worker in the assembly workshop of Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory, created a tool fixture for drilling holes in the wall panels of the 11-type transporter after two days and one night of painstaking research, which eliminated a scribing process and greatly shortened auxiliary time. He completed the task of twelve hours and forty minutes in one hour and five minutes, increasing production efficiency by ten and a half times.

After the youth workers in various factories and enterprises in Xuzhou City launched a movement to learn from Wang Chonglun's production innovation, more than 50 young workers broke through production quotas from January to mid-February. Liu Wenyi, of the Xuzhou Transportation Branch Locomotive Depot of the Jinan Railway Administration, and the foreman jointly studied and improved the axle sleeve of the cylinder lathe, completing twelve hours of work in four hours, increasing work efficiency by two times.

The broad masses of young workers in Kunming City have learned from Wang Chonglun's spirit of technological innovation and have achieved many new achievements in production. Meng Youcheng, a member of the Communist Youth League at the Kunming Wire Factory, actively improved technology and has created new records six times in a row. Li Shaozhong, a young worker at the Kunming Drilling Machine Repair Factory, learned from Wang Chonglun to improve his working methods, completing the task for March in seven and a half days and ensuring quality.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Wang Chonglun, a young planer at the Machinery General Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, has created and improved eight new tools in three years.

In the past three years, the new tools created and improved by Wang Chonglun mainly include "bending plate fixture," "screw cutting fixture," "turret," "gang tool," and "universal tool fixture." The use of these new tools has greatly improved the production capacity of the original machinery. For example, after the "screw cutting fixture" was used on the planer, the screws that could only be planed one by one in the past could be planed thirteen at the same time. In this way, the production plan for the past month could be completed in advance within three days. After the "bending plate fixture" was used on the planer, the tool that could only clamp five templates in the past could clamp twenty-five, increasing production efficiency by four times. The "universal tool fixture" created by Wang Chonglun in April 1953 is the most valuable of the tools created by Wang Chonglun. With this universal tool fixture, mechanical parts that could only be manufactured on the slotting machine in the past can now be manufactured smoothly on the planer, and production efficiency can be increased to seven and a half times.

Wang Chonglun is not satisfied with continuous creation. He absorbed the experience of advanced worker Wei Yuxi and tried to shorten auxiliary production time as much as possible. In production, he made a box for the tools that were scattered around the lathe in the past, so that the tools were lined up in the box. In this way, he could squeeze out two hours from non-production time every day to use for formal production.

Wang Chonglun's innovative spirit has opened up the path of how the machinery industry can tap the potential of equipment. In 1953, Wang Chonglun completed more work than four times the workload of 1953. This year, he has set an advanced plan to complete the equivalent of sixteen months of work.

    技术革新热潮扩展到各工业部门
    王崇伦三年来创造和改进了八种新工具
    【本报讯】全国各地厂矿企业职工在总路线鼓舞下，今年以来学习鞍钢职工技术革新经验有了新的发展。现在，技术革新热潮已从国营工业扩大到地方国营工业，从钢铁冶炼企业扩大到轻工业和交通运输部门，从东北地区扩展到南部边疆。据黑龙江省十六个地方国营工厂的统计，从今年一月到三月，职工们共提出技术改革等方面合理化建议六百八十四件，已实现的有二百八十三件。许多创造发明、合理化建议对发挥企业潜在力量，都起了很大的作用。如新华玻璃器械厂过去生产大玻璃瓶子，一个小组十四个人日产七百多个，废品率高达百分之十一点六。在今年讨论计划中，工人富凤岐提出利用半机械化模子代替手工劳动，试制结果每个小组十一个人日产一千七百个，废品率降低到百分之零点五七，单位成本由两千九百元降低到两千二百六十七元。
    营口市全市职工从一月份以来，共提出两千八百多件合理化建议，其中有三百多件是属于技术改革的。地方国营辽东漂练厂电气工人王子丰创造剪毛机成功，使剪毛工作由手工劳动变为自动化，减轻了工人的劳动强度，提高了产品质量，产量提高了百分之五十。
    张家口市工会联合会在二月份利用业余时间，举办了第一期工业劳动模范训练班。参加训练班的劳动模范回厂后，各厂职工就展开技术革新运动。张家口矿山机械厂装配车间技术工人刘树林，经过两天一夜的苦心钻研，创造了十一型运输机壁板打眼的工具胎，减去了一道划线工序，大大缩短了辅助时间，用一小时零五分的时间完成了十二小时四十分钟的任务，生产效率提高了十倍半。
    徐州市各工厂企业的青年工人学习王崇伦生产革新的运动展开后，从一月到二月中旬，有五十多个青年工人突破了生产定额。济南铁路管理局徐州市运输分局机务段工场刘文义，和领工员共同研究改进了镟缸机轴套，四小时完成了十二小时的任务，工作效率提高了两倍。
    昆明市广大青年工人学习了王崇伦的技术革新精神，在生产上取得许多新的成绩。昆明电线厂青年团员孟友诚，积极改进技术，已连续六次创造了新纪录。昆明钻机修造厂青工李绍忠，学习王崇伦改进工作方法，以七天半的时间完成了三月份的任务，并保证了质量。
    【新华社十四日讯】鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂青年刨工王崇伦三年来创造和改进了八种新工具。
    三年来，王崇伦创造和改进的新工具，主要有“弯板卡具”、“开螺丝切口卡具”、“转刀架”“排刀”和“万能工具胎”等。这些新工具的使用，大大提高了原有机械的生产能力。如“开螺丝切口卡具”在刨床上使用后，原来只能一个一个刨的螺丝，可以十三个同时刨，这样，过去一个月的生产计划三天内就能提前完成。“弯板卡具”在刨床上使用后，也使原来卡五块模板的工具变成卡二十五块，使生产效率提高四倍。一九五三年四月，王崇伦创造的“万能工具胎”是王崇伦所创造的工具中最有价值的一种。有了这个万能工具胎，过去只能在插床上制作的机械零件，在刨床上也能顺利制造了，生产效率还能提高到七倍半。
    王崇伦在不断地创造中并不满足。他吸收了先进工人韦玉玺的经验，尽量缩短辅助生产时间。在生产中，他给过去散扔在车床周围的工具做了个箱子，让工具都在箱子里排好队。这样，他每天就可以在非生产时间内挤出两个钟头用到正式生产上来。
    王崇伦的革新精神，打开了机械工业如何发挥设备潜力的道路。一九五三年的一年中，王崇伦完成的工作量比四个一九五三年的工作量还多。今年，他又订出了完成相当于十六个月工作量的先进计划。
