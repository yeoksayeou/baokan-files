    Prevent Sweet Potato Black Rot Starting from the Seedling Stage

    The sweet potato is a food beloved by the Chinese people. Its planting area across the country is very large, and its yield is also very high. The harvest from an ordinary mu of sweet potatoes is equivalent to two, three, or even four mu of grain crops. At the same time, sweet potatoes contain a large amount of starch, making them a raw material for manufacturing sweet potato flour and brewing wine, vinegar, etc.; in rural areas, they are also good feed for feeding cattle and pigs.
    However, sweet potatoes are not easy to store and often rot in large quantities during storage. This is mainly due to the harm caused by sweet potato black rot. In the dozen or so major sweet potato-producing provinces where sweet potato black rot is rampant, the phenomenon of rotting becomes even more serious as the disease develops. For example, in the winter of 1953, more than 1.88 million jin of sweet potatoes rotted in seven villages in Qingyuan and Mancheng counties, Hebei Province, due to black rot. In Fuzhuangtou Village in Ding County and Tingsijian Village in Changli County, Hebei Province, the annual losses caused by black rot during the sweet potato seedling stage alone amount to more than 200 million yuan. Black rot not only affects the storage of sweet potatoes, but also causes illness and death in cattle when they are fed sweet potatoes infected with this disease. From November 1952 to January 1954, 9,828 head of cattle in Henan Province died from poisoning after eating sweet potatoes infected with black rot.
    The transmission routes of sweet potato black rot include seed potatoes, soil, manure, and insects. Therefore, prevention and control must also start from these aspects; however, cultivating disease-free seedlings is the central link in preventing and controlling this disease. Promoting warm water soaking of seeds in areas where spring sweet potatoes are mainly planted, and promoting the taking of cuttings from spring sweet potato fields in areas where summer sweet potatoes are mainly planted, can both obtain disease-free seedlings. Last year, the North China Agricultural Seed Research Institute promoted warm water soaking of seeds in key demonstration areas in Changli County, Hebei Province, with very good results and was very popular among the masses. Experiments conducted by the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences at the Suxian Prefecture Farm in Anhui Province proved that adopting the method of taking cuttings from spring sweet potato fields also has a significant disease prevention effect. This year, agricultural technicians in various sweet potato planting areas should specifically guide farmers to try these methods when cultivating and planting sweet potato seedlings.

    从育苗时期着手防治甘薯黑斑病
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
    甘薯是我国人民喜爱的一种食物。它在全国的播种面积很大，产量也很高。普通一亩甘薯的收获量相当于粮食作物二、三亩甚至四亩。同时，甘薯含有的淀粉较多，是制造薯粉和酿造酒、醋等的原料；在农村中，又是喂牛喂猪的良好饲料。
    但甘薯不容易收藏，在收藏时期经常大批腐烂。这主要是因甘薯黑斑病为害。在甘薯黑斑病蔓延的十几个主要产薯省份里，随着病害的发展，腐烂现象也更加严重。如一九五三年冬天，河北省清苑、满城两县七个村就因黑斑病烂掉甘薯一百八十八万多斤。河北省定县阜庄头、昌黎县渟泗涧两村，每年仅在甘薯育苗期，因黑斑病遭受的损失就有两亿元以上。黑斑病不仅影响甘薯的收藏，用染有这种病害的甘薯喂牛还会使牛患病和死亡。从一九五二年十一月到一九五四年一月，河南省的耕牛因吃染有黑斑病的甘薯中毒而死亡的就有九千八百二十八头。
    甘薯黑斑病的传播途径有种薯、土壤、粪肥和昆虫等，因此防治也必须从这些方面着手；但培育无病秧苗是防治这种病害的中心环节。在种春薯为主的地区推行温汤浸种，在种夏薯为主的地区推行从春薯地里取蔓扦插，都可以得到无病秧苗。去年华北农业种学研究所在河北省昌黎县重点示范地区推行温汤浸种效果很好，很受群众欢迎。华东农业科学研究所在安徽省宿县专区农场的试验，证明采用从春薯地里取蔓扦插的办法，也有显著的防病效果。今年各种植甘薯地区的农业技术干部在培育、栽种薯苗时，应具体指导农民试行这些方法。
