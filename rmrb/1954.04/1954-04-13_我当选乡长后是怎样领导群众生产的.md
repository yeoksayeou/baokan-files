I Am Leading the Masses in Production After Being Elected Township Head
Liu Xianrong said Chen Houyu recorded

I am the township head of Shili Dian Township, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province. Shili Dian Township is one of the first townships in the county to hold universal elections. In this election, the masses elected me as township head, and I deeply felt that the masses had given me the greatest honor and a noble responsibility. The masses trust me so much, how should I respond to everyone? I thought that only by leading the masses to produce better and produce more grain could I support the country's industrial construction. On February 25th, our township held a People's Congress and made a resolution on production, after which we mobilized the masses throughout the township to engage in production.

However, the implementation of the resolution did not go so smoothly. At the beginning, we encountered resistance from some of the masses. One type of person was unwilling to engage in agricultural production and only wanted to go out and earn cash to spend. The second type of person thought that the season was still early and that the land could not be repaired. The third type of person was afraid of suffering losses. Because repairing the land is not something that one person can do, mutual assistance is needed, but some people felt that the days in February and March were short, and they were afraid that they would suffer losses in the future when returning work hours.

In view of this situation, we first organized propagandists and people's representatives under the leadership of the Party branch to carry out propaganda and education work among the masses. First, we calculated an account for the masses: going to the kiln to carry coal to the city to sell, earning 5,200 yuan a day, after eating, there is not much left, using this effort to repair one mu of land can increase production by four sheng of grain, and over time, the increase in production will be even greater; and more importantly, it supports national construction. We also combined this with publicity about the fact that farmer Ma Weijun repaired the edges of the land and adjusted the soil last year, thus increasing production by more than double. This overcame the idea of some of the masses who were unwilling to engage in agricultural production and only wanted to go out to find odd jobs to earn money. Secondly, Township Party Branch Secretary Liu Zhenliang led Yin Yufu's group to use seven laborers to repair one mu of land in half a day, and organized the mutual aid team leaders of the whole township to visit, which also broke the excuse that the ground was frozen and could not be repaired. Village cadre Feng Naijiang said:
“If others can repair it, why can’t we! The main thing is that we don’t lead, and we must lead well when we go back. We must always catch up with them!” After returning, he immediately studied and conveyed the experience of Yin Yufu's group in repairing the land with branch secretary Li Fengtong, and led three groups to repair 63 mu of land in two days. We organized 32 representatives from the whole township to visit, which promoted the production work of the whole township. As of March 16, one agricultural production cooperative and 22 mutual aid groups in the township have been put into production.

Once production started, problems arose again. Because the days were short at this time, everyone was afraid of suffering losses and was unwilling to do their own work. We strengthened specific leadership. There is one agricultural production cooperative and 32 mutual aid groups in the township. We first helped the cooperative to formulate a plan and started to take action, and then helped the 32 groups to formulate a five-day plan, and helped solve the problem of wage rates: because the days were short, the labor calculation standard was reduced from ten points to nine points. We also adopted the method of fixed points and flexible calculation in production. For example, Ma Zhong, a member of the Yin Yufu mutual aid team, did a good job and worked hard, so the score was increased from nine points to nine and a half points. Liu Xizhu was late to go to the field, so the score was reduced from five points to three points. In this way, no one suffered losses, and everyone actively produced. Sun Sucheng used to go to the city to catch a market every other day, but now he goes to the field every day. The team members also launched a competition, and the whole team repaired ten mu of land in six days.

In order to further promote production, we helped the Ma Minquan Agricultural Production Cooperative to formulate a plan to repair 40 mu of land in five days, and mobilized the agricultural production cooperative to challenge the mutual aid groups in the whole township. All 32 mutual aid groups responded to the challenge and set conditions. In this way, the masses' enthusiasm for production became even greater. The Ma Minquan Agricultural Production Cooperative repaired 38 mu of land in three days. Ren Maozhi's group repaired 16 mu of land in two days, adjusted 3 mu of soil, and accumulated 750 dan of fertilizer. Three women from Feng Tinggui's group participated in digging soil and building dams, and jointly repaired 10 mu of land with the eleven male laborers in the whole group. The number of participants also increased day by day. For example, Ren Maozhi's group had only 13 people on the first day, but increased to 22 people on the second day. A total of 291 male laborers and 110 female laborers in the township participated in production.

From March 1 to March 18, in the past ten days or so, the following achievements have been made in production: 30,000 dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, 352 mu of land have been repaired, a credit cooperative has been established, with 566 shares collected (total share capital of 17 million yuan), and 8.7 million yuan has been lent to 30 households including Li Haizhu to help them buy 8 head of livestock, 134 pieces of agricultural tools, 20 pigs, and other means of production.

After the universal election, we led the masses to do these things, which made the prestige of the people's government even higher. The masses all said: The government we elected ourselves is doing good things for us. In the future, we must listen to the people's government and do a good job in production.

    我当选乡长后是怎样领导群众生产的
    刘显荣说　陈厚裕记
    我是山西省左权县十里店乡的乡长。十里店乡是全县的第一批普选乡中的一个。这次选举中，群众把我选做乡长，我深深感到群众给了我最大的荣誉和崇高的责任。群众对我这样信任，我该用什么来回答大家呢？我想，只有领导群众更好地生产，多打粮食，支援国家工业建设。二月二十五日，我们乡召开了人民代表大会，作出了关于生产的决议，会后就发动全乡群众投入了生产。
    可是，决议的贯彻并不那么顺利。开始时遇到了某些群众的抵触思想。一种人是不愿搞农业生产，光想出去抓现钱花。第二种人是认为季节还早，不能修地。第三种人是怕吃亏。因为修地不是一个人能做的事情，需要互助，可是有些人觉得二、三月天短，怕将来还工时自己吃亏。
    根据这种情况，我们首先在党总支的领导下组织宣传员和人民代表向群众进行了宣传教育工作。先在群众中算了一笔账：去窑上驮煤到城里卖，一天挣上五千二百元，除了吃就剩不多了，要用这个功夫修上一亩地，能增产四升粮食，年长日久增产得更多；而更主要的是支援了国家建设。还结合宣传了农民马维俊去年修了地边、调剂了土壤，因而增产一倍多的事实。这样就克服了部分群众不愿从事农业生产，只想出外找零钱花的思想。其次，乡总支书记刘振良领导尹玉富组用七个劳动力在半天时间内修地一亩，组织了全乡互助组长参观，又打破了地冻不能修的借口。村干部冯乃江说：
  “人家能修我们怎么就不能修！主要是咱不领导，回去以后一定好好领导，总要赶上他们！”他回去以后立即和分支部书记李凤桐研究并传达了尹玉富组修地的经验，领导三个组在两天内修地六十三亩。我们又组织全乡三十二个代表去参观，这就推动了全乡的生产工作。全乡到三月十六日为止，有一个农业生产合作社、二十二个互助组投入了生产。
    生产一开始，问题又来了。因为这时天短，谁也怕吃亏，都不愿去做自己的活。我们就加强了具体领导。全乡有一个农业生产合作社，三十二个互助组。我们先帮助社里订出计划，开始行动，又帮助三十二个组订出五天计划，并帮助解决了工价问题：因为天短，把劳动计工标准由十分降到九分。在生产中还采用了死分活计的办法。如尹玉富互助组组员马忠做活好，又卖力，就由九分提高到九分五。刘喜珠下地迟，由五分减到三分。这样谁也不吃亏了，都积极生产。孙速成以前隔一天去城赶一回集，现在天天下地。组员们还发起竞赛，全组在六天内修地十亩。
    为了把生产更推进一步，我们帮助马民权农业生产合作社订出五天修地四十亩的计划，发动农业生产合作社向全乡的互助组提出挑战。三十二个互助组都应了战，并订出了条件。这样群众的生产劲头更大了。马民权农业生产合作社三天修地三十八亩。任毛芝组两天修地十六亩，调剂土壤三亩，积肥七百五十担。冯廷贵组有三个妇女参加了刨土垒堰，和全组十一个男劳动力共同修地十亩，参加的人数，也一天比一天多了。如任毛芝组第一天只有十三个人，第二天就增加到二十二个。全乡有二百九十一个男劳动力和一百一十个女劳动力参加了生产。
    自三月一日到三月十八日，十几天来在生产方面取得了以下成绩：积肥三万担，修地三百五十二亩，成立了一个信用合作社，集股五百六十六股（共股金一千七百万元），贷给李海珠等三十户八百七十万元，帮助买牲口八头、农具一百三十四件、猪二十口和其它生产资料。
    普选后，我们领导群众做了这些事情，使人民政府威信更加提高了。群众都说：咱们自己选出来的政府，净给咱们办好事情，今后要好好听人民政府的话，搞好生产。
