The unprecedented prosperity and strength of the Soviet Union infinitely inspires our confidence in socialist construction and the struggle of peace-loving people around the world to defend peace. Now the great Soviet people are fighting to realize the new tasks put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government to further develop the national economy and improve the people's living standards. We wish you great victories in this historically significant struggle, and wish the Soviet Union - the strong fortress of world peace - even greater prosperity and strength.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    Long live the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!
