Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th dispatch from TASS: World opinion continues to pay close attention to the Soviet proposals for guaranteeing European collective security, as put forward at the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and in the Soviet government's note of March 31 to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States.

The major newspapers of the People's Democratic countries particularly point out that the Soviet government, in pursuing its consistent policy of peace, does not abandon any opportunity that can be used to ease international tensions. For example, an article published in the Czechoslovak "People's Defense Daily" writes that no one can fail to see that the Soviet proposals are a major step in defending peace. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Western governments to defend and maintain their policies, even in the eyes of their own people. The Romanian "Free Romania" writes: "The recent Soviet proposals lay the foundation for new consultations on the most pressing international issues."

Newspapers in capitalist countries continue to comment on the Soviet plan to establish a European collective security system. Many bourgeois newspapers tacitly acknowledge that the Soviet Union's reasons for advocating the establishment of a collective security system are correct. They believe that the US State Department's opposition to the Soviet proposals was "too hasty" and that this step by the United States is obviously disadvantageous to Western propagandists. The British "Birmingham Post" writes: "The suggestion of a security treaty, which might also include the United States, cannot be so easily dismissed." The Austrian "Arbeiter-Zeitung" says: "It is wrong to reject the Soviet proposals without discussion... The Western countries themselves acknowledged at the Berlin Conference that the Soviet Union must be given security guarantees. They have no reason to refuse consultations on this issue." The Canadian "Citizen" writes that the Soviet proposals are worthy of full and careful analysis.

India's "Hindustan Times" warns Western countries not to reject one proposal after another that is conducive to consolidating peace. Another Indian newspaper, the "Times of India," writes: "It is difficult for Western countries to state the reasons for rejecting the Soviet proposals, and they cannot provide a convincing explanation."

The US State Department had hoped to influence world newspapers with its hasty remarks on the Soviet proposals, but it did not achieve its goal. The British "Observer" commented that the Soviet proposal to conclude a "pan-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security" has aroused a certain sympathetic reaction in Western Europe. The "New York Times" correspondent in Paris writes that this sympathetic reaction may undermine US military plans in Western Europe, especially the "European Defense Community" plan. What clearly worries the American newspapers is not only the reaction of broad public opinion in Western Europe, but also the reaction of officials in Western European countries. For example, the Belgian News Agency reported: "Belgian officials are extremely interested in the mention in the Soviet note of the possibility of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The French "Liberation" reported that disagreements arose among the heads of the French Foreign Ministry when discussing the reply to the Soviet note.

Many bourgeois newspapers acknowledge that, given the mood of world opinion, it is extremely difficult to give a negative answer to the Soviet note. For example, a Reuters commentator writes that the Soviet proposals present Western countries with a "tricky problem" when responding to the Soviet note, and he urges "great caution" in drafting a negative reply. It is clear from the comments of this Reuters commentator and many other bourgeois newspapers that Western politicians do not intend to substantively discuss the Soviet collective security plan, but are only trying to find ways to reject the plan without provoking opposition from public opinion.

The British ruling group's dissatisfaction with the US State Department's hasty rejection of discussions on the Soviet note stems precisely from the above considerations. The "New York Herald Tribune's" correspondent in Washington, Russell, points out that the State Department's "quick and violent" reaction to the Soviet government's note "has again strained Anglo-American relations. The degree of tension in this relationship and the reasons for its emergence have greatly angered America's good friends in Prime Minister Churchill's government and, as responsible people in Washington say, have strengthened forces in Britain that have long been agitating for Britain to further separate from and become independent of the United States." The "New York Times" correspondent in London, Middleton, writes, based on some remarks made in the British Parliament: "After these public remarks, government officials and political activists expressed concern in private conversations: they believe this is a manifestation of the deterioration of friendly relations between the United States and Britain. They believe this indicates that the US government is accustomed to first expressing unilateral opinions on issues of global significance and then demanding London's full support."

Some bourgeois newspapers in other countries are also dissatisfied that the Western countries do not have a plan to guarantee collective security to counter the Soviet Union's draft "pan-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security." The "New York Times" writes that the Soviet Union's recent diplomatic moves "have made some of the problems faced by those who determine Western policy exceptionally complicated."

    世界舆论重视苏联保障欧洲集体安全建议
    许多资本主义国家报纸说没有理由拒绝苏联建议
   【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：世界舆论仍极注意苏联在柏林四国外长会议上以及在苏联政府三月三十一日致法、英、美三国政府的照会中提出的关于保障欧洲集体安全的建议。
    人民民主国家的各大报纸特别指出这样一种情况，即苏联政府在执行其一贯的和平政策中，不放弃任何一个可被用来缓和国际紧张局势的机会。如捷克斯洛伐克的“人民防线报”刊载的一篇文章写道，谁也不会看不出苏联建议是保卫和平的重大步骤。西方国家政府甚至在它们本国人民面前都越来越难替它们的政策辩护和坚持它们的政策了。罗马尼亚的“自由罗马尼亚报”写道：“苏联最近的建议给就最迫切的国际问题进行新的协商打下了基础。”
    资本主义各国报纸继续评论苏联的建立欧洲集体安全体系的计划。许多资产阶级报纸默认苏联主张建立集体安全体系的理由是正确的。它们认为，美国国务院反对苏联建议“太匆忙”了，美国这一步走的显然对西方宣传家们是不利的。英国“北明翰邮报”写道：“不能这样随便地抛弃缔结也可能有美国参加的安全条约的建议。”奥地利“工人报”说：“没有讨论苏联建议就加以拒绝，这是不对的……西方国家在柏林会议上自己也承认必须给苏联以安全的保证。它们没有理由拒绝就这个问题协商。”加拿大“公民报”写道，苏联的建议是值得加以充分地、仔细地分析的。
    印度的“印度斯坦时报”警告西方国家不要把有利于巩固和平的建议一个一个都拒绝掉。印度另一家报纸“印度时报”写道：“西方国家很难说出拒绝苏联建议的理由，它们不能作出令人信服的解释。”
    美国国务院本指望以它对苏联建议急忙发表的言论来左右世界报纸，可是并没有达到目的。英国“观察家报”评论说，苏联提出的缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的主张在西欧引起了一定的同情的反应。“纽约时报”驻巴黎记者写道，这种同情的反应可能破坏美国在西欧的军事计划，特别是“欧洲防务集团”的计划。使美国报纸不安的显然不仅是西欧广泛舆论的反应，而且还有西欧各国官方人士的反应。例如，比利时通讯社报道说：“比利时官方人士对苏联照会中提到可能扩大北大西洋联盟组织一事极感兴趣。”法国“解放报”报道说，在讨论答复苏联照会时，法国外交部首脑之间发生了分歧。
    许多资产阶级报纸承认，考虑到世界舆论的情绪，要对苏联照会作出否定的答复极为困难。例如路透社的评论员写道，苏联的建议使西方国家在答复苏联照会时碰到“棘手问题”，他促请在草拟否定的答复时要“十分小心”。从这位路透社评论员与其他许多资产阶级报刊的议论可以清楚地看出，西方的政治家并不打算从实质上讨论苏联的集体安全计划，只是设法如何拒绝这一计划，而又不致引起社会舆论的反对。
    英国统治集团对美国国务院急忙拒绝讨论苏联照会表示不满，正是出于上述的考虑。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者鲁塞尔指出：国务院对苏联政府照会的“快而剧烈的”反应，“使英美关系又趋紧张了。这一关系的紧张程度及其产生的原因大大激怒了邱吉尔首相政府中的美国好朋友，并且，如像华盛顿的负责人士所说的，在英国加强了早就鼓动英国进一步脱离美国而独立的势力。”“纽约时报”驻伦敦记者密德尔顿根据英国议会中所发表的一些言论写道：“在发表这些公开的言论之后，政府人员和政治活动家在私人谈话中表示忧虑：他们认为这是美英两国之间友好关系恶化的表现。他们认为这表示美国政府习惯于就一些具有世界意义的问题先发表单方面的意见，然后再要求伦敦全力支持。”
    其他国家有些资产阶级报纸也不满西方国家没有一个保障集体安全的计划与苏联提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案相抗衡。“纽约时报”写道，苏联最近的外交步骤“使决定西方政策方针的人所面临的一些问题变得异常复杂。”
