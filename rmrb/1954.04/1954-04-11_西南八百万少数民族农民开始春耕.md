(By our correspondent from Chongqing, April 10th) The eight million minority farmers in the Southwest region who are engaged in agricultural production are joyfully welcoming the spring plowing season. Following the free distribution of 1.3 million pieces of agricultural tools by the government last year, they will receive an additional 38 billion yuan in interest-free agricultural and livestock tools from the Central People's Government this year. The funds are currently being distributed. The Yunnan Provincial Government recently allocated over 5.82 billion yuan for mountainous area production reconstruction, distributed to 14 counties and 3 districts inhabited by minority ethnic groups in Honghe, Dehong, Lancang, and Nujiang, to further support the people in the border areas to develop production. In addition to the early distribution of 80,000 pieces of agricultural tools and 980,000 catties of grain to various counties, the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang also plans to promote 300 new-style walking plows in counties such as Yajiang and Kangding.

Since the beginning of spring, farmers of all ethnic groups have been actively preparing for spring plowing. The water conservancy projects built in Longchuan County, the Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan, are expected to increase the irrigated area by more than 11,000 mu of paddy fields. The Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County in Guizhou Province is steadily developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, with 50 percent of the county's farmers participating in mutual aid groups. The Miao farmers in Wangfeng and Baode townships in Leishan County have accumulated more than 100,000 loads of various fertilizers before spring plowing. At present, in areas such as Jinggu County in Yunnan Province where two seasons of rice can be planted, on both sides of the Qingshui River and Dan River where the Miao people live in Guizhou, and in warmer counties such as Daofu and Batang on the Kangzang Plateau, spring plowing and sowing have already begun. Farmers who have received various iron agricultural tools have broken away from the backward production methods of "slash-and-burn" and "relying on the mountains for food" and have begun to carry out intensive cultivation on fixed plots of land.

    西南八百万少数民族农民开始春耕
    【本报重庆十日电】西南区八百万从事农业生产的少数民族，欣喜地迎接着春耕。他们继去年得到政府一百三十万件无偿农具后，今年又将得到中央人民政府三百八十亿元无偿的农业和牧畜业工具的帮助。该款正发放中。云南省政府最近并拨出五十八亿二千余万元山区生产改造费，分配给红河、德宏、澜沧、怒江少数民族聚居的十四个县和三个区，进一步扶助边疆人民发展生产。西康藏族自治区政府除早将八万件农具和九十八万斤粮食发到各县外，自治区农业技术指导站还计划再在雅江、康定等县推广三百部新式步犁。
    入春以来，各族农民积极准备春耕。云南傣族景颇族自治区泷川县兴修的水利，预计可增灌水田一万一千多亩。贵州省炉山县苗族自治区稳步发展互助合作组织，全县百分之五十农民参加了互助组。雷山县望丰、报德两乡苗族农民，春耕前即积下各种肥料十万余挑。现在云南景谷等县能播种两季稻的地区，贵州苗族聚居的清水江、丹江两岸和康藏高原上气候较暖的道孚、巴丹等县，业已开始春耕播种。得到各种铁质农具的农民，打破了“刀耕火种”“赶山吃饭”的落后生产方式，开始在固定地块上进行精耕细作了。
