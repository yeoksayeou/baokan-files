Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: The installation of machinery at the newly built state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory is basically complete, and trial operations began on April 7th. Various departments are actively preparing for the official start of production.

    The trial run began with the cleaning workshop. After careful inspection of the machines by installation workers, cadres, engineers, and three experts from the German Democratic Republic, the motors of the first row of machines were started. When raw cotton appeared on the apron of the cotton feeder, the worker in charge of the cloth electric box skillfully turned on the switch. The first small red light on the cloth electric box lit up, and then the belt of the first machine began to rotate. A few minutes later, scattered raw cotton had been rolled into cotton laps on the iron rollers of the lap machine. The trial run proved that the installation quality of the cleaning machine was good. The trial operation of the carding machine has also begun.

    Production preparations are being intensified. The China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation has transported a large quantity of high-quality raw cotton to the factory and has signed a product sales contract. Textile engineers, technicians, and planning department staff of the production planning team are studying and formulating technical management, operation plans, original records, and various production record forms. Auxiliary workers are also being trained.

    Apprentices who have been studying in Qingdao will soon be returning one after another. Some apprentices studying spinning are able to oversee 600 spindles, with the highest being able to see 880 spindles. More than 70 percent of the apprentices studying weaving are able to independently oversee 24 automatic looms.

    北京新建纺织厂试车
    【新华社十二日讯】新建的国营北京第一棉纺织厂机器安装工程基本结束，四月七日开始试车。各科室正为正式开工生产积极进行准备工作。
    试车是从清花车间开始的。安装工人、干部、工程师和三位德意志民主共和国的专家，仔细检查过机器以后，第一列机器的马达开动起来。当原棉在给棉器的帘子上出现时，负责开关布电箱的工人灵巧地开动电门，布电箱上的第一个小红灯亮了，随着，第一台机器的皮带就旋转起来。几分钟后，散乱的原棉已在成卷机的铁辊上卷成棉卷。试车结果，证明清花机的安装质量良好。现在梳棉机的试运转也已开始。
    生产准备工作正在加紧进行。中国花纱布公司已为这个厂运来大批优良原棉，并已签订了产品包销合同。生产筹划组的纺织工程师、技术人员和计划科职工们正在研究制订技术管理、作业计划、原始记录和各种生产记录表报。辅助工人也正在训练。
    在青岛学习的徒工马上就要陆续回来了。学习细纱的徒工有些已能看六百个纱锭，最高的能看到八百八十锭。学习织布的徒工，有百分之七十以上能够独立看二十四台自动织布机。
