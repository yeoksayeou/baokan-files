    [Reported by this newspaper] The "Neues Deutschland" published the communique of the 17th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on January 25, 1954, announcing the expulsion of anti-Party elements engaged in splitting activities, Herrnstadt (former candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, editor-in-chief of "Neues Deutschland") and Zaisser (former member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Minister of Public Security of the German Democratic Republic) from the Party. It also gave appropriate punishments to the other three candidate members of the Political Bureau, Ackermann (former State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic), Jendretzky (former First Secretary of the Greater Berlin Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany), and Schmidt (former Chairman of the Democratic Women's League of Germany, Chairman of the State Trade and Supply Committee), who committed errors of principle in the struggle against the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group. Ackermann received a severe warning and was expelled from the Central Committee; Jendretzky and Schmidt received warnings, and they were also not elected in the subsequent election of new members of the Political Bureau.
    During their tenure as leading cadres of the Party and the state, Herrnstadt and Zaisser adopted a defeatist line aimed at undermining the unity and solidarity within the Party, made despicable remarks slandering and splitting the Party, and engaged in factional activities against the Party in an attempt to usurp the Party's leadership and bring about the restoration of capitalist rule in the German Democratic Republic.
    The Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group repeatedly distorted the Party and its leading role with the reactionary views of social democracy, worshipped the spontaneity of unorganized masses, and promoted a policy of capitulationism. Under Herrnstadt's direction, "Neues Deutschland" published a series of anti-Party articles. These articles took a hostile attitude towards the Party's organization, slandered the Party, and pitted the non-Party masses against the Party. Herrnstadt did everything in his power to fundamentally obliterate the Party's great historical achievements, attempting to discredit the Party in order to achieve the sinister goal of destroying the Party. Herrnstadt used his anti-Party remarks to encourage fascist provocateurs to stage riots. This exposed his true face as a pawn of imperialism. Zaisser, taking advantage of his position as Minister of Public Security, engaged in factional activities to split the Party, attempting to make Party members working in the Ministry of Public Security immune from the Party's supervision, and conspiring to place the Public Security apparatus above the Party. In his talks with staff members of the Ministry of Public Security, Zaisser openly disseminated capitulationist views, arguing that the German Democratic Republic might be transformed into a bourgeois republic. Zaisser's anti-Party activities showed that he was a class alien hostile to the masses, hostile to the Party leading the masses, and hostile to the German Democratic Republic.
      On June 9, 1953, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany adopted a new policy aimed at raising the living standards of the people of all strata, further consolidating the German Democratic Republic, and promoting reconciliation between the eastern and western parts of Germany, thereby restoring Germany's unity. On June 11, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic successively formulated decrees based on the new policy. The international reactionaries and the Adenauer group in West Germany feared that the new policy would greatly hinder their sinister war plans, and instigated fascist provocateurs to launch the long-planned riot on June 17. During this period, the Party and the people were engaged in a serious struggle against international reactionary forces, while the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group believed that this was an opportunity for them to launch an offensive against the Party and usurp the Party's leadership. In a committee appointed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, they openly suggested changing the Party's leadership so that Herrnstadt and Zaisser could obtain unlimited power. In a joint conspiracy, Zaisser shamelessly suggested that Herrnstadt be the First Secretary of the Party Central Committee. Soon after, Herrnstadt's anti-Party activities became even more rampant, and he proposed a so-called resolution draft for "innovating" the Party in the Political Bureau. He demanded "innovation" of the Party's leadership and "innovation" of the Party's central organs, that is, he wanted to usurp the Party's leadership. He incited the masses to rise up against the Party and advocated in his speech that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany be changed into a "people's party representing all classes," attempting to destroy the Party. Herrnstadt and Zaisser completely exposed their anti-Party faces as individualistic careerists, proving that they were standing on the same front as imperialism and its agents. In the struggle against the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group, other candidate members of the Political Bureau also adopted serious erroneous attitudes. Ackermann initially actively supported the anti-Party views of Herrnstadt and Zaisser. After Herrnstadt and Zaisser bowed their heads to the Central Committee, Ackermann, although separated from them, still advocated that the anti-Party activities of Herrnstadt and Zaisser should not be reported to the Central Committee, but that the whole problem should be resolved only within the Political Bureau, attempting to protect Herrnstadt and Zaisser from being expelled from the Party's leadership organs. Jendretzky and Schmidt had actively participated in the activities of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser group for a long time, but they did not make a frank self-criticism of their erroneous attitude at the Central Committee meeting, but instead avoided expressing a clear position at the meeting and downplayed their attitude, attempting to deceive the Central Committee.
    The crimes of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group in carrying out splitting activities within the Socialist Unity Party of Germany were exposed as early as the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany from July 24 to 26, 1953. This meeting passed a resolution to expel Herrnstadt and Zaisser from the Central Committee and decided to continue the investigation. From January 22 to 23, 1954, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany convened the 17th Plenary Session under the chairmanship of Comrades Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl. Comrade Hermann Matern reported on the results of the investigation of the Herrnstadt-Zaisser anti-Party group at the meeting. After discussion, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, according to the Political Bureau's proposal put forward by Comrade Hermann Matern, made the decision to expel the anti-Party elements Herrnstadt and Zaisser from the Party and made the decision to give punishments to Ackermann, Jendretzky, Schmidt and others.
    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany demonstrated Bolshevik unity and firmness in the struggle against the Herrnstadt-Zaisser reactionary group, defended the Party's unity and solidarity, and demonstrated the maturity, consolidation, and strength of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Hundreds of Party activist meetings and Party member congresses unanimously supported the Central Committee's decision.

    德国统一社会党中央委员会第十七次全会
    决定将反党反人民分子开除出党
      【本报讯】“新德意志报”一九五四年一月二十五日发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第十七次全体会议的公报，宣布把进行分裂活动的反党分子海恩斯塔特（前德国统一社会党政治局候补委员、 “新德意志报”总编辑）和蔡塞尔（前德国统一社会党政治局委员、德意志民主共和国公安部部长）二人开除出党，并给予在反对海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的斗争中犯了原则错误的其他三名政治局候补委员阿克曼（前德意志民主共和国外交部国务秘书）、颜德累茨基（前德国统一社会党大柏林市委第一书记）和史密特（前德国民主妇女联合会主席、国家贸易供应委员会主席）以应得的处分。阿克曼受严重警告处分，并被开除出中央委员会；颜德累茨基和史密特受警告处分，后来在新的政治局委员的选举中，他们也都落选了。
    海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔二人在担任党和国家的领导职务期间，采取了旨在破坏党内统一和团结的失败主义的路线，发表诬蔑党、分裂党的可耻言论，进行反对党的派别活动，以图篡夺党的领导权，造成资本主义统治在德意志民主共和国的复辟。
    海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团一再用社会民主主义的反动观点来曲解党及其领导作用，崇拜无组织群众的自发性，宣扬投降主义政策。在海恩斯塔特的主使下，“新德意志报”曾刊载了一系列反党的文章。这些文章对党的组织采取敌对态度，对党进行诽谤，并把非党群众和党对立起来。海恩斯塔特竭尽一切力量来根本抹杀党的伟大历史性的成就，企图败坏党的威信，以达到毁灭党的罪恶目的。海恩斯塔特以其反党言论去鼓励法西斯挑衅分子举行暴动。这就暴露了他自己成为帝国主义走卒的面目。蔡塞尔利用他所担任的公安部部长的职务，进行分裂党的派别活动，力图使在公安部工作的党员不受党的监督，并阴谋把公安部机构置于党之上。蔡塞尔在和公安部工作人员的谈话中，公开散布投降主义观点，认为德意志民主共和国可能转变为一个资产阶级共和国。蔡塞尔的反党活动，表明他是敌视群众、敌视领导群众的党、敌视德意志民主共和国的阶级异己分子。
      一九五三年六月九日，德国统一社会党中央政治局通过了旨在提高各阶层人民生活水平、进一步巩固德意志民主共和国、促进德国东西两部分之间的和解从而恢复德国的统一的新方针。六月十一日德意志民主共和国部长会议根据新方针陆续制定法令。国际反动派和西德阿登纳集团害怕新方针将大大地妨碍他们实行罪恶的战争计划，便指使法西斯挑衅分子在六月十七日发动了蓄谋已久的暴动事件。在这个时期内，党和人民同国际反动势力进行着严重的斗争，而海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团却认为这是他们对党实行进攻并篡夺党的领导权的机会。在由德国统一社会党中央政治局所任命的一个委员会中，他们公然建议改变党的领导，以便使海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔获得无限的大权。在共同的密谋下，蔡塞尔恬不知耻地建议由海恩斯塔特为党中央委员会第一书记。不久以后，海恩斯塔特的反党活动更加气焰高涨，在政治局中提出了所谓“革新”党的决议草案。他要求“革新”党的领导，“革新”党的中央机构，就是说，他要篡夺党的领导权。他鼓吹群众起来反对党，并在发言中主张把德国统一社会党改为“代表一切阶级的人民政党”，企图使党遭到毁灭。海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔彻底暴露了他的个人主义野心家的反党面目，证明了他们是和帝国主义及其特务分子站到了同一战线上的。在反对海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的斗争中，也有其他的政治局候补委员采取了严重的错误态度。阿克曼起初积极支持海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔的反党观点。当海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔向中央委员会低头后，阿克曼虽然和他们分开了，但仍然主张不要把海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔的反党活动向中央委员会报告，而要把全部问题只在政治局内部解决了事，企图以此来保护海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔不被逐出党的领导机构。颜德累茨基和史密特曾在较长的时间内积极参与了海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔集团的活动，但是他们二人并不是在中央委员会上对自己的错误态度进行坦率的自我批评，而是在会上避不表示明确的立场，把自己的态度加以轻描淡写，企图蒙混中央委员会。
    海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团在德国统一社会党内进行分裂活动的罪行，早在一九五三年七月二十四日至二十六日德国统一社会党中央委员会第十五次全体会议上就已被揭露出来。这次会议通过了决议，将海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔开除出中央委员会，并决定继续进行调查。一九五四年一月二十二日至二十三日，德国统一社会党中央委员会在威廉·皮克同志和奥托·格罗提渥同志的主持下，召开了第十七次全体会议，赫尔曼·马特恩同志在会上报告了对于海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反党集团的调查结果。德国统一社会党中央委员会经过讨论后，根据赫尔曼·马特恩同志提出的政治局的建议，对反党分子海恩斯塔特和蔡塞尔作出了开除党籍的决定，对阿克曼、颜德累茨基、史密特等人作出了给予处分的决定。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会在反对海恩斯塔特—蔡塞尔反动集团的斗争中，表现了布尔什维克的一致性和坚定性，捍卫了党的统一和团结，说明了德国统一社会党的成熟、巩固和强大。数以百计的党活动分子会议和党员大会一致拥护中央的决定。
