[This Newspaper] The "Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition" sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions officially opened yesterday (the 15th) at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace.

This exhibition is divided into two major parts: technical innovation and basic construction (the three major projects). The technical innovation section displays the inventions and creations of workers from thirty-five units, including a small rolling mill. Here, you can see the anti-encircling disk created by Zhang Mingshan, the universal tool tire created by Wang Chonglun, the winding machine created by Li Genyuan, and the automatic steel pusher created by worker Lu Naitao and technician Wu Liangya in collaboration. Here, you can also see the important experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel Works in carrying out the technical innovation movement from charts. Machines created by factory and mine workers in Hankou, Kunming, Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, and other places in learning the innovative spirit of advanced producers at Anshan Iron and Steel Works are also introduced to the audience through pictures. In the basic construction section, you can see the models of the large rolling mill, the seamless steel tube plant, and the No. 7 blast furnace, which are the crystallization of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. These highly automated factories, from surveying, design, construction, machine installation to personnel training and production, were all completed with Soviet assistance. Here, the construction experience of the three major projects is systematically introduced.

The actual objects and models of these exhibits were mostly made by the workers of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Works in a night-time rush in mid-February. Workers from the small rolling mill, metal products factory, steel pipe plant, and primary rolling mill did not rest during the Spring Festival in order to rush to make them. After the exhibits were transported to Beijing, Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent nearly a hundred workers and technicians to assist the exhibition in installation work. (Attached picture)
