    The Agricultural Implement Research Institute of the Northwest Administrative Committee's Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry recently organized four work teams to go to the areas promoting new agricultural implements in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to carry out technical instruction work. The main targets of instruction are cadres from technical extension stations or agricultural work stations at all levels, comrades from cooperatives and banks responsible for the supply of means of production, as well as rural activists and production experts.
    In addition to supplementing more than 38,000 old agricultural implements and promoting more than 30,000 new agricultural implements, the main focus of agricultural implement work in the Northwest Region last year was on solving the remaining problems in the promotion of new agricultural implements and focusing on imparting technology. During the year, due to the resolute implementation of the principle of repairing, testing, and teaching simultaneously, a total of more than 16,000 new-style walking plows and more than 700 sprayers were repaired for farmers, and technology was imparted to more than 8,000 people. After technical instruction, the number of walking plows used by farmers in Ningxia Province increased from 60 percent to over 80 percent. In Zhangye County, Gansu Province, the number of walking plows used reached 96 percent. After repairing and imparting technology in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, more than 90 percent of the 1,200 walking plows that were not used in the past were put into use in the fields.

    西北区继续传授使用新式农具的技术
    西北行政委员会农林局农具研究所最近组织四个工作组，分赴陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省推广新式农具地区，进行技术传授工作。传授的主要对象是各级技术推广站或农业工作站的干部，合作社、银行负责生产资料供应的同志，以及农村积极分子和生产能手等。
    西北区去年的农具工作，除增补旧农具三万八千多万件、推广新农具三万多件外，主要力量集中在解决新农具推广中的遗留问题，并着重传授技术。一年中，由于坚决贯彻边修、边试、边教的方针，共为农民修好各种新式步犁一万六千多部，喷雾器七百多架，并向八千多人传授了技术。宁夏省农民经过技术传授后，步犁使用数由百分之六十提高到百分之八十以上，甘肃省张掖县的步犁使用数达百分之九十六，陕西大荔县经过修理和传授技术，过去未用的一千二百多部步犁，有百分之九十多下地使用。
