    The United States is intensifying its collusion with the Syngman Rhee clique to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and is attempting to expand the war in Indochina, maintaining and creating tension in the Far East. All of this is to promote a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, allowing American monopoly capital groups to obtain billions in profits, thereby alleviating the threat of an increasingly imminent American economic crisis.

    Everyone knows that American monopoly capital groups relied on the Korean War and a comprehensive arms expansion and war preparation movement to abnormally expand the war industry, once creating a false sense of prosperity and seizing unprecedentedly high profits. The realization of a ceasefire in Korea was never what American monopoly capital groups wanted; they were even more alarmed and angered by the easing of the international situation caused by the Korean ceasefire.

    The Korean War was launched by the American ruling group amid the threat of a periodic economic crisis in the United States after World War II. The peak of American industrial production during World War II was in 1943, but by 1946 it had decreased by almost one-third. Although it rebounded somewhat due to intensified "Cold War" activities and preparations for a new war, the American industrial production index was still only 199 on the eve of the Korean War, about 17 percent lower than the 239 in 1943. The Korean War drove the Wall Street bosses wild with joy. "U.S. News & World Report" wrote at the time: "This is truly an ideal situation to maintain business activity at a high level. The Korean incident has banished the shadow of depression that threatened American entrepreneurs after World War II. The prospect of long-term prosperity has emerged."

      Indeed, the United States' launch of the war of aggression against Korea and its large-scale arms expansion and war preparations greatly stimulated the American military industry, causing the American industrial production index to rise to 243 in March 1953, even higher than in 1943. The American government used astronomical military orders to support the war industry. In the four years from July 1950, the United States' direct and indirect military expenditures totaled more than 220 billion U.S. dollars, an average of 1,500 U.S. dollars per person. The speed of the war industry's expansion can be illustrated by the example of the United States' military aircraft production: according to figures revealed by "U.S. News & World Report," if 1950 is taken as 100, then 1951 was 158, 1952 was 300, and 1953 was expected to reach 450. That is, it increased three and a half times in four years. Other military industries also expanded rapidly accordingly.

    While giving Wall Street bosses huge military orders, the American ruling group also greatly increased the price of military goods. According to "U.S. News & World Report" published on October 31, 1952, during the Korean War, the unit price of American military goods increased compared to the period of World War II: fighter aircraft prices rose nearly sevenfold, medium bomber prices more than elevenfold, heavy bomber prices more than fivefold, bomb sights fiftyfold, medium tanks nearly fourfold, destroyers nearly sixfold, 105mm shells two and a half times, rifles nearly threefold, and walkie-talkies two and a half times.

    In this way, American monopoly capital groups obtained astonishingly high profits during the Korean War. According to figures published in "U.S. News & World Report," American company profits in those years were as follows:
    1950: 39.6 billion U.S. dollars
    1951: 42.9 billion U.S. dollars
    1952: 39.7 billion U.S. dollars
    1953: 45 billion U.S. dollars (preliminary figures)

    The high profits obtained by American monopoly capital groups were almost double those of 1949, before the outbreak of the Korean War, or the peak of American company profits during World War II in 1943, and five or six times more than before World War II in 1939. In particular, the growth in profits was even more staggering for those large monopoly companies closely related to military production. In 1953, the net profit figures announced by General Motors, General Electric, Standard Oil of New Jersey, U.S. Steel, and DuPont were all three, four, or even five times higher than in 1943. General Motors, the company that received the most military orders from the American government, earned a total net profit of 2.497 billion U.S. dollars in four years, only 300 million U.S. dollars less than the company's total assets at the end of 1949 (2.824 billion U.S. dollars). It is not surprising that American arms tycoons are so bellicose.

    However, the "prosperity" created by war and military orders is unstable and contains increasingly acute crises. Moreover, the era when Wall Street bosses could both make money and win in war to seize greater hegemony is gone forever. American adventurers finally had to accept the ceasefire, and the Korean armistice promoted the easing of international tensions, making it increasingly difficult for the United States to pursue its arms expansion and war preparation policy. In this way, the United States cannot but face a serious economic crisis.

    Below is the rise and fall of the American industrial production index in recent years, as published by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. From this, people can see why American monopoly capitalists are so afraid of peace and how precarious their lives are.

    (Based on 1935-1939 as 100, adjusted for seasonal variations)
    Highest level during World War II (1943 average): 239
    At the outbreak of the Korean War (June 1950): 199
    First peak during the Korean War (April 1951): 223
    First trough (July 1951): 212
    Second peak (February 1952): 222
    Second trough (July 1952): 193
    Third peak (March 1953): 243
    At the Korean armistice (July 1953): 232
    Current period of crisis development (February 1954) (estimated): 209
    [Note] Why did American industrial production fluctuate so greatly during the Korean War? This is due to the impact of the armistice negotiations, the drastic contraction of civilian industrial production inevitably caused by economic militarization, and the disruption of the normal development of the capitalist world economy by war and arms expansion.

    The fluctuations in the American economy that began in the spring of 1951 occurred precisely when the American forces invading Korea suffered repeated defeats and were forced to accept Korean armistice negotiations. When the armistice negotiations began, American industrial production fell to its lowest point of that year, and the stock market also experienced a major slump. The Wall Street bosses' cries of fear of peace began. "The New York Times" even loudly proclaimed: "A sudden peace will harm industry and commerce." The drastic decline in American industrial production in 1952 (which fell even lower than when the Korean War began) also coincided with the completion of all agenda items of the Korean armistice negotiations except for the prisoner of war issue.

    The possibility of a Korean armistice has been playing a role in the American market. Thus, people have seen a situation of fighting while talking, with no resolution for a long time. As United Press reporter Harry Frantz reported on July 19, 1953, the American government had "worked hard" to make the negotiations "progress slowly" in order to "give business and industry time to adjust." However, the armistice that Wall Street bosses were unwilling to accept was still to come. But "good times don't last." "U.S. News & World Report," which asserted that there would be "long-term prosperity" at the outbreak of the Korean War, had to exclaim at the time of the Korean armistice: "Now, prosperity is in its final stages...The threat of war, a larger-scale war, is no longer a stimulus that is constantly working."

    Another major reason for the large fluctuations in American industrial production during the Korean War was the contraction of civilian industrial production. The contraction of civilian industrial production is an important characteristic of economic militarization. This factor has an impact even during wartime boom periods. The rise in the American industrial production index was achieved by the war industry's growth greatly offsetting the decline in civilian industrial production. American civilian industrial production shrank extremely sharply during the Korean War. For example, according to figures revealed by the American press, the output of passenger cars (automobiles), which are less related to the war, was only 85 percent of that in 1950 in 1951, and only 66 percent in 1952. The number of American residential buildings decreased by 22 percent in 1951 compared to 1950, 20 percent in 1952, and even more after 1953. The American textile industry production index decreased by 16 percent in December 1951 compared to the same period in 1950, and 24 percent in the same period in 1953. Even so, the sale of civilian industrial products was still very difficult. At the time of the Korean armistice, the inventory of American manufacturing companies and merchants had increased by 24 billion U.S. dollars compared to the beginning of the Korean War, totaling 77.3 billion U.S. dollars, which was more than the total value of American industrial production in 1949 (estimated to be 75.4 billion U.S. dollars).

    The contraction of civilian industrial production means the unemployment of a large number of workers in the civilian industrial production sector, a reduction in the supply of consumer goods, a rise in consumer goods prices, and a serious blow to the people's livelihood. In this way, the contradiction between the development of productive forces and the low purchasing power of the people, which is a factor in the American economic crisis, is further expanded and sharpened.

    The American people bore a heavy tax burden during the Korean War. By 1953, the total amount of taxes and other burdens borne by the American federal and local governments had reached an astonishing figure of over 100 billion U.S. dollars per year, breaking the highest record in history. This is more than double the actual cost of food purchased by the American people that year. In addition, the American working people also endured the pain of rising living expenses. According to statistics from the American Labor Research Association, the relative status of American workers (the comparison between actual wages and productivity) in 1952 was 4 percent lower than in 1949, and 21.2 percent lower than in 1939. After 1953, due to increased unemployment and wage cuts, American workers not only continued to see their relative status and real wages decline, but even their nominal wages decreased. At the same time, the taxes borne by American workers in 1953 increased several times compared to before the Korean War, living expenses rose by 15 percent, and rent burdens rose by 30 percent. The situation for farmers was even more serious. In 1953, American farmers' income fell to 12 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of one-third compared to 1947.

    Moreover, the arms expansion and war preparation burdens and "embargo" policies that the United States imposed on many countries during the Korean War more broadly damaged the interests of many countries. With the help of the monopoly position created by the "embargo" policy and the increasing dependence of satellite countries on the United States, American capital is expanding outward at an alarming rate. According to the figures published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which were obviously concealed, from the end of 1950 to the end of 1953, American companies' overseas investments increased from 11.8 billion U.S. dollars to 16 billion U.S. dollars, an expansion of more than 35 percent in three years. The traditional markets of capitalist countries such as Britain and France are being invaded and controlled by American monopoly capital. In particular, the damage suffered by countries such as Indonesia, Malaya, and Chile, which produce strategic raw materials such as rubber, tin, and copper, is even more difficult to estimate. Now, the growing threat of an American economic crisis is making all capitalist countries that have fallen into difficulties as a result of following the American war policy extremely uneasy, and the British ruling class cannot but go to great lengths to avoid the impact of the American economic crisis.

    Now, the American economic crisis is approaching. The American ruling group does not believe that continuing on the path of militarization cannot truly solve the crisis of overproduction, and still attempts to support the war industry with huge military budgets and increased military orders. According to "U.S. News & World Report," the American government's direct military orders for the 1954 fiscal year are expected to be 53.2 billion U.S. dollars, 400 million U.S. dollars more than the highest year during the Korean War (1953 fiscal year). Therefore, the American ruling group appears even more afraid of peace, afraid of negotiation, and afraid of the easing of international tensions.

      However, the American ruling group's policy of relying on war, arms expansion and war preparations, and creating tension to maintain maximum profits for Wall Street is incompatible with the interests of the American people and the countries and peoples of the world. The people of the world unanimously demand further easing of tensions, a final resolution of the Korean question and the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, a cessation of the so-called "Cold War" and arms expansion and war preparations, and the development of international trade, thereby consolidating world peace and improving the normal development of the economic lives of all countries.

        [Note] According to the new industrial production index published by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (based on 1947 to 1949 as 100), February 1954 was about 10 percent lower than July 1953. This figure is estimated accordingly.

    朝鲜问题和美国经济危机
    李高
    美国正在加紧勾结李承晚集团阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，并力图扩大印度支那战争，在远东保持和制造紧张局势。这都是为了推行扩军备战政策，使美国垄断资本集团获得亿万利润，借此缓和美国日益逼近的经济危机的威胁。
    谁都知道，美国垄断资本集团曾依靠朝鲜战争和全面的扩军备战运动，畸形地扩展战争工业，一度造成虚假繁荣景象，攫取了空前高额的利润。朝鲜停战的实现原就不是美国垄断资本集团所愿意的，他们对于朝鲜停战导致国际局势的缓和，更是感到惶恐和恼怒。
    朝鲜战争是美国统治集团在第二次世界大战后美国发生周期经济危机的威胁中发动的。在第二次世界大战时期的一九四三年达于最高峰的美国工业生产水平，到了一九四六年几乎降低了三分之一。此后虽因加紧进行“冷战”，准备新战争而有回升，但到朝鲜战争爆发前夕，美国工业生产指数仍只有一九九，比一九四三年的二三九，约低百分之十七。朝鲜战争使华尔街老板们狂欢到发疯了。“美国新闻与世界报道”在当时写道：“这真是一种使商业活动维持一个高度水平的如意局面。朝鲜事件把第二次世界大战之后就威胁着美国企业家的萧条的魔影祛除了。长期景气的远景出现了。”
      的确，美国发动侵朝战争及进行大规模扩军备战，大大刺激了美国军事工业，使美国工业生产指数上升到了一九五三年三月的二四三，即比一九四三年还要高了。美国政府用天文数字的军事订货来支持战争工业。从一九五○年七月起的四年中，美国的直接间接军费共达二千二百余亿美元，即每一美国人平均要负担一千五百元。战争工业膨胀之速可举美国的军用飞机产量为例：据“美国新闻与世界报道”透露的数字，如以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年为一五八，一九五二年为三○○，一九五三年预计达四五○。即四年中增加了三倍半。其他军事工业也相应地迅速扩大着。
    美国统治集团在给华尔街老板们以庞大的军需订货时，还大大提高了军火价格。据一九五二年十月三十一日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”所载，朝鲜战争期间美国军火的单位价格比起第二次世界大战时期，战斗机价格上涨了七倍弱，中型轰炸机十一倍强，重轰炸机五倍多，投弹瞄准器五十倍，中型坦克四倍弱，驱逐舰六倍弱，一○五公厘炮弹二倍半，步枪三倍弱，步行话机二倍半。
    这样，美国垄断资本集团就在朝鲜战争期间获得了惊人的高额利润。据“美国新闻与世界报道”所载数字，这几年的美国公司利润如下：
    一九五○年三九六亿美元一九五一年四二九亿美元一九五二年三九七亿美元一九五三年四五○亿美元（初步数字）
    美国垄断资本集团获得的这样高的利润，较之朝鲜战争爆发前的一九四九年或美国公司在第二次世界大战中的空前获利最多的一九四三年都几乎高一倍，比第二次世界大战前的一九三九年更是多了五、六倍。特别是那些和军需生产关系密切的巨大垄断公司，利润的增长更为惊人。一九五三年，通用汽车公司、通用电气公司、新泽西美孚石油公司、美国钢铁公司和杜邦公司等所公布的纯利数字，都比一九四三年增加了三、四倍或五倍以上不等。获得美国政府军火订货最多的通用汽车公司一家，四年中共获纯利二十四亿九千七百万美元，比这个公司在一九四九年年底时的资产总额（二十八亿二千四百万美元）只少三亿余美元。美国军火大亨们所以如此好战，就不足为奇了。
    但是，依靠战争和军事订货造成的“繁荣”是不稳定的，并且蕴藏着日益尖锐的危机。不仅这样，华尔街老板们一手拿稳赚钱，一手又能在战争中取胜，夺取更大的霸权的时代，已一去不复返了。美国冒险家不得不终于接受停战，朝鲜停战促进了国际紧张局势的缓和，美国推行扩军备战政策日益困难。这样，美国就不能不面临着严重的经济危机了。
    下面是美国联邦储备局发表的美国工业生产指数最近几年来的起落情况。人们从这里可以看到美国垄断资本家为什么那样害怕和平，他们过的日子是多么的不安定啊。
    （以一九三五—一九三九年为一○○，调整了季节性的变化）第二次世界大战中最高水平（一九四三年平均）二三九朝鲜战争爆发时（一九五○年六月）一九九朝鲜战争中第一次上升的最高点（一九五一年四月）二二三第一次回降的最低点（一九五一年七月）二一二第二次上升的最高点（一九五二年二月）二二二第二次回降的最低点（一九五二年七月）一九三第三次上升的最高点（一九五三年三月）二四三朝鲜停战时（一九五三年七月）二三二目前危机趋势的发展时期（一九五四年二月）（估计）二○九〔注〕美国工业生产在朝鲜战争期间为什么会有那样大的升降幅度？这就是由于停战谈判的影响，和经济军事化所必然造成的民用工业生产的剧烈萎缩，以及战争和扩军备战使资本主义世界经济的正常发展遭到了扰乱的缘故。
    一九五一年春开始的美国经济的波动，就正是发生在侵朝美军连遭失败，被迫接受朝鲜停战谈判的时候。停战谈判开始时，美国工业生产降到了那年的最低点，股票市场也掀起了大跌风。华尔街老板们害怕和平的叫嚷开始了。“纽约时报”即曾大声疾呼：“突然出现的和平将会伤害工商业”。一九五二年美国工业生产的剧烈下降（那次降到了比朝鲜战争开始时还低），也正好是朝鲜停战谈判的议程除战俘问题外全部达成了协议的时候。
    朝鲜停战的可能性这个因素，一直在美国的行情中起着作用。于是，人们看到了边谈边打，长期不决的局面。正如合众社记者哈里·弗朗兹在一九五三年七月十九日所报道的：美国政府曾“努力”使谈判“缓慢进展”，目的是“给予工商界以时间来进行调整”。可是，华尔街老板所不甘心的停战还是要到来。但是，“好景不常”。曾在朝鲜战争爆发时断言有了“长期景气”的“美国新闻与世界报道”不得不在朝鲜停战时惊呼道：“现在，繁荣已处在其最后阶段。………战争，更大规模战争的威胁，不再是经常起作用的刺激了。”
    美国工业生产在朝鲜战争期间所以会有很大的升降的另一主要原因，是民用工业生产的萎缩。民用工业生产的萎缩是经济军事化的重要特征。这个因素就在战争景气期间也要发生影响。美国工业生产指数的上升，是靠战争工业的增长大大地抵消了民用工业生产的下降数字来获得的。美国民用工业生产在朝鲜战争期间萎缩得极为猛烈。例如据美国报刊透露的数字，和战争关系较少的客车（汽车）产量，一九五一年只及一九五○年的百分之八十五；一九五二年只及百分之六十六。美国的住宅建筑所数，一九五一年比一九五○年减少了百分之二十二，一九五二年减少百分之二十，一九五三年以后减少的更多。美国的纺织工业生产指数在一九五一年十二月比一九五○年同期降低了百分之十六，一九五三年同期则降低了百分之二十四。即使这样，民用工业产品的销售仍很困难。朝鲜停战时，美国制造公司和商人手里的存货比朝鲜战争开始时增加了二百四十亿美元，总数达七百七十三亿美元，这比一九四九年美国工业生产总值（据估计是七百五十四亿美元）还要多。
    民用工业生产的萎缩，意味着民用工业生产部门广大工人的失业，人民消费品供应的减少，消费品价格的上涨，人民生活遭受到严重的打击。这样，就使得美国经济危机的因素——生产力的发展与人民购买力低落之间的矛盾，更为扩大化和尖锐化了。
    美国人民在朝鲜战争期间承担了沉重的税负，到一九五三年，美国联邦政府和地方政府的税收和其他负担总额已递加到超过每年一千亿美元的惊人数字，打破了历史上的最高纪录。这比美国人民这年购买食物的实际费用还多一倍。此外，美国劳动人民还忍受着生活费用上升的痛苦。据美国劳工研究会的统计，美国工人的相对地位（实际工资和生产率的比较）在一九五二年就比一九四九年降低了百分之四，比一九三九年则低百分之二十一点二。一九五三年以后，由于失业增加和工资被削减，美国工人不但相对地位和实际工资继续降低，连货币工资也减少了。与此同时，美国工人在一九五三年所负担的税收则比朝鲜战争前增加了数倍，生活费用上涨了百分之十五，房租负担上涨了百分之三十。农民的情况更严重。一九五三年美国农民的收入降至
  一百二十亿元，这比一九四七年减少了三分之一。
    不仅这样，美国在朝鲜战争期间强加于许多国家的扩军备战负担和“禁运”政策，则更广泛地损害了许多国家的利益。借助于“禁运”政策所造成的垄断地位和仆从国家对美国日益加强的依赖性，美国资本正在以惊人的速度向外扩张。仅据美国商务部所公布的显然被隐瞒了的数字，从一九五○年底到一九五三年底，美国企业在国外的投资就由一百一十八亿美元增加到一百六十亿美元，三年中扩张了百分之三十五强。英、法等资本主义国家的传统市场，受到美国垄断资本的侵袭和控制。特别是出产橡胶、锡、铜等战略原料的印尼、马来亚、智利等国所受的损害，更是难于估计。现在，美国正在增长着的经济危机的威胁，使得所有追随美国战争政策因而陷于困境的资本主义国家极感不安，英国统治阶级就不能不为避免美国经济危机的影响而颇费周章。
    现在，美国经济危机正在日益逼近着。美国统治集团并不认为继续走军事化的道路不能真正解救生产过剩的危机，依然企图以庞大的军事预算和增加军需订货来支持战争工业。据“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，美国政府在一九五四年度的直接军需订货，预计为五百三十二亿美元，这比朝鲜战争中最高的一年（一九五三年度）还要多四亿美元。因此，美国统治集团就显得更加害怕和平，害怕协商，害怕国际紧张局势的缓和。
      但是，美国统治集团依赖战争、依赖扩军备战和制造紧张局势，为华尔街维持最大限度利润的政策，是和美国人民和世界各国及其人民的利益不相容的。世界人民一致要求进一步缓和紧张局势，要求日内瓦会议能够最后解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平，并停止所谓“冷战”和扩军备战，发展国际贸易，从而巩固世界和平，改善各国经济生活的正常发展。
        〔注〕据美国联邦储备局发表的新的工业生产指数  （以一九四七到一九四九为一○○），一九五四年二月比一  九五三年七月约低百分之十。这一数字，是据此估计的。
