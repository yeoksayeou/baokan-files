Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant

    The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant was rebuilt last year. The blast furnaces in this plant were redesigned according to advanced Soviet design ideas. Each is equipped with four highly efficient Cowper stoves, which greatly increases production. Among them, No. 6 blast furnace created a new national record for small blast furnaces smelting "steelmaking pig iron" on January 4th.

    The increase in pig iron production at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has strongly supported the production of machinery manufacturing industries in Shanghai and other places. Cowper stoves of the blast furnaces at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant.

    马鞍山炼铁厂
    马鞍山炼铁厂是在去年重建的。这个厂的炼铁炉是根据苏联先进设计思想重新设计的。每座都安装有效率很高的四个高白式热风炉，产量因而大大提高。其中六号炼铁炉在一月四日创造了全国小型炼铁炉冶炼“炼钢生铁”的新纪录。
    马鞍山炼铁厂生铁产量的增加，有力地支援了上海等地机械制造业的生产。马鞍山炼铁厂炼铁炉的高白式热风炉。
