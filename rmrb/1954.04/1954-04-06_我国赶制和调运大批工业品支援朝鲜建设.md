    Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: Our country is supporting the people of Korea in restoring construction with large quantities of industrial products. This year, machine factories across the country will manufacture many kinds of machinery and equipment for the Korean people.
    Workers in more than a dozen machine factories in East China are working hard to produce dozens of types of textile machinery parts. Concrete mixers manufactured by the Beijing People's Machinery General Factory have already been shipped to Korea. Water pumps jointly manufactured by the Shenyang Water Pump Factory and the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory for irrigating Korean terraced fields are expected to be shipped to Korea successively early this month to help Korean farmers with spring plowing. The China Transportation Electric Equipment Company and the China Chemical Raw Materials Company have also organized factories in various places to supply Korea with more than 500 kinds of electrical power, lighting equipment, communication equipment, as well as various industrial raw materials and chemical reagents.
    A large amount of basic construction materials, including tens of thousands of cubic meters of wood, more than 100,000 tons of cement, several thousand tons of construction steel, refractory materials, and roofing felt, have mostly been shipped to Korea. The China Hardware and Machinery Company has organized factories to manufacture more than 800 kinds of construction equipment, including woodworking tools and construction instruments.
    The Harbin, HuangguTtun, Tangshan, Qishuyan, Changxindian, and Jinan locomotive and rolling stock repair factories, and the Mudanjiang locomotive repair factory, will rebuild and overhaul many locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars for Korea this year. At present, the first quarter's task of rebuilding and overhauling freight cars and passenger cars has been overfulfilled in various factories, and the quality of the vehicles is very good.
    Most of the fabrics provided by the Central People's Government Ministry of Textile Industry and the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to support the Korean people have been shipped to Korea. Department stores in Northeast China, Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places have prepared more than 180 kinds of daily necessities for the Korean people, some of which were shipped to Korea at the beginning of the year, and most of the other daily necessities have been shipped in the first quarter. The China Medical Company has organized more than a dozen pharmaceutical factories and medical equipment manufacturing factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places to manufacture a large number of medicines and medical equipment, which will soon be leaving the factories.
    Workers in various places regard supporting the Korean people in restoring construction as being as important as building their own motherland, ensuring the completion of production tasks on schedule, and the quality of the products is very good. At the beginning of March, the Korean railway department needed a batch of cabooses. Although the factories that accepted the orders had already determined their production plans, they immediately accepted the orders. After the active efforts of the workers, they were finally completed on schedule. The products ordered by the Tianjin No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory were products that had not been produced in the past. The workers formulated new operating procedures based on the specifications and requirements of the new products. In order to ensure that the concrete mixers could be safely transported to Pyongyang, workers at the Beijing People's Machinery General Factory, in addition to using wooden boards to pack them securely, added cross wooden frames to the outside of each machine package to support all four sides, and then tied them tightly with thick iron wires. They said: This is being shipped to Korea, so it must be nailed tightly, supported firmly, and tied securely, so that it can reach Pyongyang smoothly.
    All relevant departments attach great importance to the work of supporting the Korean people in restoring construction. The various departments under the China Sundries Export Company regard the export of materials to support the Korean people as the focus of their work. The Central People's Government Ministry of Railways has selected seven large factories with excellent technology and equipment to undertake the task of repairing locomotives and rolling stock for the Korean railways. It also requires all employees to fully develop the spirit of internationalism and to guarantee quality with superb technology. In order to ensure that industrial products for aid to Korea are quickly delivered to Korea, railway departments in various places regard the transportation of materials for aid to Korea as an urgent task, and give priority to allocating vehicles for shipment. After receiving the task of supplying daily necessities to Korea, department stores in Northeast China, Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and other places first allocated them from their inventory and immediately organized specialized processing and ordering according to Korea's needs.

    我国赶制和调运大批工业品支援朝鲜建设
      【新华社五日讯】我国正以大批工业品支援朝鲜人民恢复建设。今年全国各地的机器工厂将为朝鲜人民制造许多种机器设备。
    华东区有十几个机器工厂的工人正在紧张地赶制几十种纺织机械配件。北京市人民机器总厂制造的混凝土拌合机已启运赴朝。沈阳水泵厂和上海电焊机厂合制的用于灌溉朝鲜梯田的水泵，预计本月初可以陆续运往朝鲜，帮助朝鲜农民春耕。中国交通电工器材公司和中国化工原料公司也已组织各地工厂供应朝鲜五百多种电气动力、照明设备器材、通讯器材以及多种工业原料和化学试剂等。
    大量的基本建设材料，包括几万立方公尺木材、十多万吨水泥、几千吨建筑钢材、耐火器材、油毡等大部都已运往朝鲜。中国五金机械公司组织各厂制造的建筑器材就有木工工具、建筑仪器等八百多种。
    哈尔滨、皇姑屯、唐山、戚墅堰、长辛店、济南机车车辆修理工厂和牡丹江机车修理工厂，今年将为朝鲜重造和大修许多机车、货车和客车。现在各厂第一季度重造和大修货车、客车的任务都已超额完成，而且车辆的质量都很好。
    中央人民政府纺织工业部以及中国花纱布公司支援朝鲜人民的布疋大部已运到朝鲜。东北、天津、上海、北京等地百货公司为朝鲜人民准备的一百八十多种日用品有一部分在年初就运到朝鲜，其他日用品大部已在第一季度启运。中国医药公司组织天津、上海、北京等地十几个制药厂、医疗器械制造厂制造的大批药品、医疗器械也快要出厂。
    各地工人都把支援朝鲜人民恢复建设看作和建设自己的祖国一样重要，保证按期完成生产任务，而且产品的质量都很好。三月初，朝鲜铁路部门需要一批守车，接受订货的各工厂虽然都已确定了生产计划，但仍立刻接受下来，经过职工们的积极努力，终于按期完成。天津市第二印染厂接受的订货是过去没有生产过的产品，工人们就根据新产品的规格和要求，订出了新的操作规程。北京市人民机器总厂工人为了使混凝土拌合机安全运到平壤，在包装时除用木板包装牢靠外，又在每台机器包装外面加上十字木架顶住四边，再用粗铁丝捆紧，他们说：这是运到朝鲜去的，一定要钉紧、顶牢、捆扎实，叫它顺利到平壤。
    各有关部门都十分重视支援朝鲜人民恢复建设的工作。中国杂品出口公司所属各部把支援朝鲜人民的出口物资作为工作的重点。中央人民政府铁道部选择技术、设备优良的七个大厂担负为朝鲜铁路修理机车车辆的任务，还要求全体职工充分发挥国际主义精神，要以精湛的技术来保证质量。为了保证援朝工业品迅速地送到朝鲜，各地铁路部门都把运送援朝物资当作紧要任务，尽先拨车发送。东北、天津、上海、北京等地百货公司接到供应朝鲜日用百货的任务后，都由库存物资中尽先拨出，并按照朝鲜需要立即组织专门的加工、订货。
