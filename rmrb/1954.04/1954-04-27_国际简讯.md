    US Industrial Production Continues to Decline in March
    US industrial production continued to decline in March, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline since last summer.
    According to a report by the US President's Council of Economic Advisers, the industrial production index for March fell to 123 (with the average for 1947-1949 as 100), which is 14 points lower than the peak of 137 reached in July last year, or 10.2 percent. It is also lower than the industrial production index of 125 in January and 124 in February (revised figure) by two points and one point respectively.

    Lebanon Signs Secret Military Agreement with the United States
    Syria's "Al Binaa" and Lebanon's "Al Yawm" and "Al Shark" newspapers reported that Lebanon and the United States have signed a secret military agreement under Truman's Point Four Program.
    The reports said that the agreement stipulates the construction of four airports, which will be guarded by 8,000 US Air Force officers and soldiers. It also provides for the supply of a large amount of weapons and equipment to the Lebanese army, the dispatch of a US military mission to Lebanon to train Lebanese troops, and so on. The term of this military agreement is ten years.
    According to the newspaper reports, the final clause of the agreement states: This agreement is of a secret nature and falls within the scope of Truman's Point Four Program; therefore, it does not require discussion and approval by parliament.

    American Secret Agents Frequently Active in Uttar Pradesh, India
    Dr. Sampurnanand, Minister of Home Affairs of the Uttar Pradesh government in India, recently said in the State Assembly that American "missionaries" are frequently active in Uttar Pradesh and on the border between Nepal and China. He said that their activities have caused concern to the Uttar Pradesh government.
    He said that people often expose the fact that these secret agents are engaged in political activities under the guise of "missionaries." For example, the Deputy Speaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Hargonind Pant, and others have revealed that some "missionaries" carry and use radio transceivers.
    According to the "Tarun Bharat" newspaper, about two months ago, a group of American secret agents went to Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, and paid people to write propaganda materials in support of the US-Pakistan military alliance.
