    Expansion of Soviet Foreign Trade Relations
    Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce, Nie Sieterov
    From the very first day of its establishment, the Soviet state has consistently pursued a policy of peace and cooperation among all nations, and a policy of expanding economic ties with all countries. All trade agreements signed by the Soviet Union, regardless of whether the other party is a large or small country, are based on the principles of mutual benefit, equality, and mutual respect for sovereignty. The purpose of concluding such agreements is to conduct cooperation on the basis of equivalent exchange of goods beneficial to both parties.
    The history of international trade relations shows what a reliable partner the Soviet state is in commerce. Throughout the entire period of establishing trade relations between the Soviet Union and other countries, there has never been a case where the Soviet Union failed to fulfill its obligations. Soviet trade organizations have never failed to comply with delivery deadlines and payment dates.
    After the end of World War II, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to restore international trade as quickly as possible and to expand trade relations between Eastern and Western countries that had been destroyed by the war. However, due to the interference of the United States in the trade of other capitalist countries, the development of trade relations between Eastern and Western countries came to a standstill. The reduction of trade by Western countries with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the European People's Democracies has not been able to hinder the economic development of the democratic camp. It has promoted the emergence of two parallel world markets, replacing the unified, all-encompassing world market.
    In the market of the democratic camp, there are no difficulties of goods滞销[lacking a market]. The Soviet Union and other countries in the democratic camp have become closely integrated economically and have conducted economic cooperation and mutual assistance very well. The basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge. This has enabled these countries to develop their economies rapidly, and at the same time, it has enabled their foreign trade, based on equality and mutual respect for each other's interests, to develop. It is sufficient to point out the following: In the period from 1948 to 1952 alone, the trade volume among the countries of the democratic camp increased more than threefold.
    The foreign trade of the countries in the democratic camp is developing rapidly. For example, the foreign trade volume of the five European People's Democracies of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria increased more than sixfold from 1946 to 1952. This rapid development of foreign trade relations among the democratic countries is primarily because these countries have expanded their trade with the Soviet Union. In 1952, the trade share with the People's Democracies accounted for 80 percent of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade.
    The economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is developing smoothly. For example, in 1950, the trade volume between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies accounted for only 26 percent of the People's Republic of China's total foreign trade, while in 1953 it exceeded 70 percent.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a manifestation of a new type of equal and truly friendly relations that are impossible under the capitalist system, a characteristic inherent in the countries of the democratic and socialist camp.
    Due to the development of trade with the countries of the democratic camp, the Soviet Union, with its strong socialist economy, has given these countries the maximum amount of all-round and skilled assistance. The Soviet Union supplies the People's Democracies with the goods necessary to complete their national economic plans. In the Soviet Union's supply of materials to the People's Democracies, the proportion of machinery and equipment has been increasing, including complex equipment for industrial enterprises. In addition, the Soviet Union has also given these countries technical assistance in the design, construction, and start-up of factories, transferred patents and licenses to them free of charge, and imparted to them the technical operating methods of production. The Soviet Union's selfless, fraternal assistance has enabled the People's Democracies to establish enterprises that manufacture new products in their own countries, as well as industrial departments equipped with modern machinery and equipment, which these countries would not and could not have under other conditions.
    In the post-war period, another world market, the market of capitalist countries headed by the United States, has been developing in another direction. The reduction of trade with the Soviet Union, People's China, and the European People's Democracies has aggravated the economic difficulties of the capitalist countries, deteriorated their currency conditions, and had adverse consequences for employment and the living standards of the working people.
    Things could only be this way. Artificially isolating many countries from the huge international market, including the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democracies, with a population of 800 million, cannot but have a detrimental effect on the economies of the capitalist countries. The short-sighted policy of certain leading groups in Western countries, especially the United States, has led their own foreign trade into a dead end. After closing off their access to the markets of the Soviet Union, China, and the Eastern European People's Democracies, the business circles of certain Western countries headed by the United States have faced the fact that their exports have sharply declined.
    However, in recent times, an increasing number of countries have expressed their willingness to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies. For example, in 1953, the Soviet Union conducted trade with 51 countries, of which trade with 25 countries was conducted on the basis of one-year or multi-year trade agreements. The Soviet Union's foreign trade volume in 1953 increased to 23 billion rubles, while in 1952 it was 20.8 billion rubles, which means an increase of 11 percent. At the same time, the foreign trade volume in 1953, calculated at comparable prices, has almost exceeded the pre-war level by three times.
    The development of international trade in the first months of 1953 and 1954 has increasingly clearly confirmed that the United States' hegemonic and restrictive policies in international trade have been bankrupt. The urgent economic needs of Western countries are more important and more powerful than the barriers and obstacles they have artificially created, and these barriers are collapsing one after another. Prominent figures in political and business circles have increasingly frequently issued sober calls for a re-examination of US foreign trade policy.
    In this regard, it is worth noting the following statement made recently by Pearson, Chairman of the US Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, who said: "We should accept and spread the idea that international trade can help improve living standards around the world and that it is a straight path to peace. I hope to be a witness to a re-examination of our policies on East-West trade relations..."
    The following is a statement made by the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Westminster, London on March 12 this year: "We merchants should have the freedom to breathe. We should be free. In the presence of trade restrictions, ... we have been restricted and bound to such an extent that normal trade is impossible... We should be able to participate in the competition of foreign markets, because without foreign trade, we cannot live... In the presence of trade freedom, we merchants will be able to move forward and obtain the funds for living." The speeches of representatives of many capitalist countries at the recent meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe also reflected this position.
    The Soviet Union's desire to develop international trade in the first few months of 1954 has once again been confirmed. In January and February, the Soviet Union concluded trade agreements with Norway, the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, Afghanistan, France, Sweden, Finland, and many People's Democracies. The prospects for trade between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are also noteworthy. Trade negotiations are underway between representatives of British companies and representatives of Soviet foreign trade organizations, and trade contracts are being signed. Not long ago, a delegation from the Finnish government came to Moscow to hold negotiations on the conclusion of new long-term agreements on the mutual supply of goods.
    Thus, life itself is demanding the normalization of international trade and the restoration of disrupted international economic ties, which are necessary for the economic prosperity of every country. There is ample evidence that the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies have a sincere desire to promote the normalization of international trade and to develop it, and that promoting international trade is one of the ways to consolidate peace.

    苏联对外贸易关系的扩大
    苏联商会主席　涅斯捷罗夫
    苏维埃国家从它建立的第一天起，就始终不渝地一贯推行着各国人民和平与合作的政策，推行着和所有国家扩大经济联系的政策。苏联所签订的一切贸易协定，不论缔约国对方是大国或是小国，都是建立在缔约国双方互利、平等和互相尊重主权的原则上的。缔结这种协定的目的，就是要在对缔约国双方都有利的商品等价交换的基础上，来进行合作。
    国际贸易关系的历史表明，苏维埃国家在商业方面是一个如何可以信赖的对手。在苏联和其它国家建立贸易关系的全部时期中，从来没有发生过苏联不履行自己的义务的情事。苏联的贸易组织从来没有不遵守过供货期限和付款日期。
    第二次世界大战结束后，苏联曾表示愿意尽可能快地恢复国际间的货物交换，并扩大为战争所破坏的东西方国家之间的贸易关系。但是，由于美国对其它资本主义国家贸易的干涉，东西方国家贸易关系的发展停顿了下来。西方各国对苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲人民民主国家的贸易的缩减，并没有能够妨碍民主阵营各国经济的发展。它促成了两个平行的世界市场的出现，以代替那个统一的、无所不包的世界市场。
    在民主阵营市场中没有货物滞销的困难。苏联和民主阵营其它国家在经济上已密切结合起来，并很好地进行了经济上的合作和互助。这种合作的基础，就是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。这就使这些国家的经济有了迅速的发展，同时也使它们之间以平等和彼此尊重对方利益为基础的对外贸易获得了发展。只须指出下面的一点就足以说明了：仅在一九四八到一九五二年时期内，民主阵营各国间的贸易额就增加了两倍多。
    民主阵营各国的对外贸易正在飞快地发展着。例如，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚这五个欧洲人民民主国家的对外贸易额在一九四六——一九五二年内增加了六倍多。各民主国家对外贸易关系的这种迅速发展，首先是因为这些国家扩大了和苏联的贸易。一九五二年在苏联对外贸易总额中，对人民民主国家的贸易份额占百分之八十。
    中华人民共和国和苏联及人民民主国家的经济合作正在顺利地发展着。例如，一九五○年中国和苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易额只占中华人民共和国对外贸易总额的百分之二十六，而一九五三年已超过百分之七十。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约是一种新型的、在资本主义制度下不可能有的、平等和真正友好关系的表现，这种关系乃是民主和社会主义阵营各国所固有的特点。
    由于对民主阵营各国的贸易的发展，苏联以其强大的社会主义经济给了这些国家以最大限度的、各方面的熟练的帮助。苏联供应各人民民主国家用以完成它们的国民经济计划所必需的货物。在苏联给各人民民主国家的物资供应中，机器和装备所占的比重已愈来愈多，其中包括工业企业用的复杂装备在内。此外，苏联还给了这些国家以像在工厂的设计、兴建和开工方面的技术帮助，无偿地让给它们专利权、执照，并把生产的技术操作方法传授给它们。苏联的无私的、兄弟般的帮助使各人民民主国家在自己国家内建立了制造新产品的企业以及装备有现代机械设备的工业部门，在别的条件下，这些国家没有而且也不可能有这样的机器设备。
    战后时期，另一个世界市场，即以美国为首的资本主义各国市场，则是在向着另外一个方向发展。对苏联、人民中国及欧洲各人民民主国家的贸易的缩减，加重了世界各资本主义国家的经济困难，恶化了它们的通货状态，并对就业和劳动人民生活水平产生了不良的后果。
    事情也只能是这样。把许多国家和包括苏联、中国与其它人民民主国家的、拥有八亿人口的巨大国际市场人为地隔离开来，当然不能不对资本主义各国的经济发生恶劣的影响。西方国家、特别是美国的某些领导集团的目光短浅的政策，把它们本国的对外贸易引上了绝路。在封闭掉自己的进入苏联、中国和东欧人民民主国家市场的通路以后，以美国为首的某些西方国家的商业界面临了本国的出口锐减的事实。
    但是，最近时期，已有愈益众多的国家表示愿意和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家发展贸易关系。例如，一九五三年，苏联已和五十一个国家进行了贸易，其中与二十五个国家的贸易是根据一年或多年的贸易协定来进行的。苏联一九五三年的对外贸易额增达二百三十亿卢布，而一九五二年则为二百零八亿卢布，这就是说，增加了百分之十一。同时，一九五三年的对外贸易额，以比较价格计算，已几乎超过战前水平的三倍。
    一九五三年和一九五四年初国际贸易的发展，愈益明显地证实，美国在国际贸易中的专横和限制政策已宣告破产。西方国家迫切的经济需要比它们所人为地建立起来的壁垒和障碍更为重要和更为有力，这些壁垒已一个接着一个地倒塌了。政治界和商业界的著名代表人物已经愈益频繁地发出了要求重新审查美国对外贸易政策的清醒的呼声。
    在这方面，值得注意的是不久前国际商会美国委员会主席皮尔逊所作的下列声明，他说：“我们应当接受和传播有关国际贸易能帮助改进世界各地生活水平，以及它是一条走向和平的坦途的意见。我希望做一个重新审查我们在东西方贸易关系的政策上的见证人……”
    下面是今年三月十二日伦敦魏斯特敏斯特区的商会主席所作的声明：“我们商人应当有自由呼吸的机会。我们应当是自由的。在存在着贸易限制的情况下，……我们已被限制、束缚到这样的程度，以致进行正常的贸易都不可能了……。我们应当能够参加国外市场的竞争，因为没有对外贸易，我们就不能生活……。在存在着贸易自由的情况下，我们商人将能够向前发展，并取得生活的资金。”在不久前举行的联合国欧洲经济委员会会议上，许多资本主义国家代表的发言也反映了这一立场。
    在一九五四年的头几个月中苏联发展国际贸易的愿望，再次获得了证实。在一月和二月，苏联和挪威、比利时—卢森堡经济联盟、阿富汗、法国、瑞典、芬兰以及许多人民民主国家缔结了贸易协定。苏联和英国之间开展的贸易的远景也是值得注意的。在英国公司代表和苏联对外贸易组织的代表之间正在进行贸易谈判并签订贸易合同。不久前芬兰政府代表团曾前来莫斯科，以便就缔结新的相互供应货物的长期协定举行谈判。
    这样，生活本身正在要求国际贸易正常化，要求被破坏的国际经济联系得到恢复，这种联系是每一个国家的经济繁荣所必需的。有充分的例证说明，在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家方面是具有促进国际贸易正常化并使其获得发展的真诚愿望的，而促进国际贸易乃是巩固和平的途径之一。
