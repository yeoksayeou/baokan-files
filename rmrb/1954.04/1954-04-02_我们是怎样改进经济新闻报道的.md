    How We Improved Economic News Reporting
    Dongbei Ribao Editorial Department
    For a long time, the news reporting of the Dongbei Ribao has suffered from the shortcomings of being dry, stiff, and having a narrow scope of coverage, with economic news reporting being the most prominent example. The newspaper has been constantly criticized by readers because of this. In July 1952, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the editorial department to improve reporting methods, requiring the newspaper to comprehensively and vividly reflect the process of the Party's policies being realized among the people, and to strive to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. Based on this instruction, the editorial department held a symposium for reporters in September, proposing the requirement of "going deep into reality, going deep into the masses, and reflecting the process of the Party's policies being realized among the masses," and organized everyone to implement it. In the following months, although the news reports and features written by reporters had some improvements, the newspaper as a whole did not undergo a fundamental transformation. At the beginning of 1953, the editorial department made overcoming the shortcomings of dry and stiff news reporting the central focus of the year's improvement of professional work in its annual work plan, and from April onwards, it organized professional study and reform focusing on "strengthening news reporting, expanding the scope of coverage, and enriching the content of reporting."
    This business reform is centered on improving and strengthening news reporting, and solving other problems in connection with it. Because news (including news stories and features, especially news stories) is the largest form of reporting in newspapers and a unique propaganda weapon for newspapers. Using news to fully, timely, and accurately report new situations, new things, new people, and new experiences that are educational for the people and have guiding significance for practical work, and to conduct political mobilization, is an effective way to expand the scope of coverage and enrich the content of reporting. In the case of the Dongbei Ribao, news reporting, especially economic news reporting, is precisely the weakest link in various forms of reporting. Not only is the amount of news small, and the scope of coverage narrow, failing to reflect the rich content of national economic construction and people's lives; but also in news writing, there are serious shortcomings such as conceptualization, formulaic writing, and being lengthy and dry.
    To improve and strengthen economic news reporting, it is necessary to unify everyone's understanding of the role of news through learning. To this end, we first organized the editorial department staff to study articles on news writing (Comrade Qiao Mu's "Everyone Should Learn to Write News" and Brantman's "On News Reporting") and news reports from the Soviet "Pravda," and organized study discussions in the editorial department's business journal. After a period of study, everyone initially recognized the purpose and requirements of strengthening news reporting, understood the role and characteristics of news, and thus unified the understanding of improving economic publicity by starting with strengthening news reporting. At that time, we also encountered some ideological problems: One was being satisfied with the old reporting methods, opposing strengthening news reporting, expanding the scope of coverage, and enriching the content of reporting to guiding practical work, worrying that strengthening news reporting would weaken the guiding role of practical work, and thus hesitating to move forward and being afraid of making improvements. In the early stage of learning, this understanding was more prominent among some comrades. These comrades have made some changes after a period of study, but it will still take a longer period of practice, and only after preliminary results have been achieved in strengthening news reporting, can the problem be truly resolved. The emergence of this understanding is mainly due to insufficient understanding of the significance and role of strengthening news reporting, and not clearly understanding that strengthening news reporting, fully and comprehensively reflecting new situations, new things, new people, and new experiences, is precisely to strengthen the guiding nature of reporting. Another understanding understands the role of newspapers as only an encouraging role, ignoring the introduction of advanced experience and reporting on the central issues in current practical work. This is a tendency to deviate from reality and also a manifestation of opposing strengthening news reporting and guiding practical work. Another understanding is that everything in the past seems to be wrong, holding an attitude of negating everything, thinking that everything must be restarted. There is also an understanding that strengthening news reporting is only seen as a formal improvement, thinking that strengthening news reporting is just about writing more news, writing it shorter and faster, and thinking that this is a relatively easy thing. This shows that some comrades have not understood that strengthening news reporting is an important step to adapt to the new situation and improve economic publicity. First, it is an improvement in the content of publicity, not just a change in form. It is necessary to improve ideological understanding and improve organizational work to achieve it. Therefore, it is not an easy task, but a complex and arduous task.
    In order to further make all staff members recognize the role of news and eliminate the above-mentioned ideological obstacles, the editorial department then held reporter symposiums and editor symposiums in June and July respectively. The reporter symposium, combined with the review of past work, conducted a discussion on "how to further go deep into the masses, go deep into life, combine with the central work to strengthen news reporting, expand the scope of coverage, and enrich the content of reporting." The meeting criticized the practice of some reporters being unwilling to use news for timely reporting and wanting to one-sidedly engage in "experience," and the view that strengthening news reporting is only a formal issue; it emphasized that to strengthen news reporting, it is necessary to further go deep into reality and go deep into the masses, so as to timely reflect new situations, new things, new people, and new experiences, and to correctly and profoundly reflect the process of the Party's policies being realized among the masses. According to the spirit of this symposium, we also put forward "having a center, being multifaceted, writing about typical examples, and writing about the masses" as specific requirements for strengthening news reporting. The editor symposium focused on how to clarify reporting ideas. Because to make economic publicity have a center, be multifaceted, and strengthen the policy and ideological guidance and political mobilization of economic publicity, it is necessary to first clarify reporting ideas among the editorial staff, otherwise all improvements will easily become formalities. Since September, based on the issues and requirements raised in these two symposiums, the newspaper has made improvements in practice through the National Day propaganda and the increased production and conservation movement reporting.
    More than half a year of professional study and professional reform have achieved preliminary results. According to the feedback from various readers, the more significant improvements are first in highlighting the reporting center and closely linking with reality. This has always been a good working tradition of the Dongbei Ribao, and it is also one of the main requirements of this business reform. In the main reports of various aspects in the third and fourth quarters of 1953, this was achieved. In particular, the reporting on the increased production and conservation competition in the industrial sector was rapid and concentrated, which played a timely mobilizing role in mobilizing the masses to participate in the competition. When the reporting turned to in-depth reporting, the typical experience of the 53 Factory in carrying out the competition in depth, and the advanced experience of Hu Zhaosen and Wang Chonglun were continuously introduced, which also played a great role in promoting the competition to go in depth. Secondly, in the overall aspects and the reporting of each work, the themes are broader than in the past. For example, in the industrial sector, local industries, mines, and forest industries, etc., which have rarely been reflected for a long time in the past, have been appropriately reported. In each report, it is also possible to conduct multifaceted reporting around a center. For example, when the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine started production, we focused on issues such as the scale of the project, the workers' enthusiasm for labor, the growth of technical strength, Soviet assistance, and the support from various regions, and conducted reporting. And in terms of regions, Jilin and Benxi, which were less reflected in the past, now occupy a certain position in the newspaper. Third, the shortcomings of dryness and stiffness have been overcome, and short and lively news reports have increased. For example, the reporting on the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine, the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and the large-scale rolling mill projects used relatively short, popular, and lively forms to publicize their scale and political and economic significance. Each project was reported continuously from near completion to formal production. When publishing news, it was accompanied by features, special articles, letters from readers, and pictures. The kind of news that was often seen in the past, with cumbersome content, unclear background, and unclear organization, has been greatly reduced. General news has achieved being relatively short and clear, and features have also paid attention to writing about the process and writing about people. The essays published in the newspaper, the added compilation of short news, and thematic collections of news (such as the thematic collection of news "Give Play to the Pioneering Spirit of Production Innovators" reporting on the creations of workers in various places in the competition), and other diverse reporting forms, are also very popular among readers; some readers have also checked their own work in connection with the examples criticized in the essays. Readers said: "The Dongbei Ribao is not only diversified in form, but also reflects the diversity of social life, and more reflects the lives and activities of the masses."
    In organizing the professional study of the editorial department and carrying out professional reform, we have gained the following experiences.
    It is necessary to closely combine professional study with improving work, focusing on the main problems in the work. And improving business must be based on the actual situation, starting from specific problems, formulating specific plans, and taking a series of specific measures. In 1951, we organized professional study to strengthen ideology. Although the issues were raised correctly, and everyone actively participated, due to the lack of clear improvement goals and specific improvement measures, we felt that we had no way to start and the results were not great. This time, the study focused on strengthening news reporting, stipulating specific requirements for having a center, being multifaceted, writing about the masses, and writing about typical examples; not only did the editorial committee have specific plans, but each business group also made specific improvement plans in the reporting plan, requiring this reform to be "specific to each person and each report." In addition, the editorial department's business journal "Business Briefing" was used as a tool to promote learning, and discussions and reviews were carried out in the journal. These specific measures played a great guarantee role in the business reform. Among these specific measures, the central link is the formulation and implementation of the reporting plan. Many problems were recognized in principle, but it was found that they were not clear when formulating the reporting plan; some opinions were consistent in principle, but disagreements may still occur when formulating the reporting plan. Therefore, the formulation of the reporting plan is not only a program of action for implementing business reform, but also an important step to further clarify understanding and unify thinking.
    However, if there are only specific requirements and specific measures, and it is not possible to fundamentally improve understanding, then specific requirements will not be easily implemented. Although we recognized at the beginning that this business reform is not just a matter of reporting methods, but first a matter of reporting content, and ultimately a matter of how to understand the tasks and role of newspapers during economic construction; we did not emphasize this point sufficiently in the specific implementation. In the learning process, we also did not conduct in-depth discussions on some fundamental issues in improving publicity, especially economic publicity, which could not fully mobilize everyone ideologically and implement specific measures to improve business on key issues. Of course, improving the economic publicity and reporting of newspapers is a complex issue. It is necessary to oppose the tendency of being conservative and unwilling to move forward, and to prevent the mood of negating everything, being impatient and rash, and at the same time, it is impossible to require everyone to have a clear understanding and unified thinking at once. It is necessary to learn and improve, gradually deepen, and use the achievements already achieved on the existing foundation (such as the aforementioned several better reports) as examples to guide everyone to gradually improve.
    In this business study and business reform, we also realized that learning from the advanced experience of Soviet newspapers in news reporting has great inspiration and help for our business reform. Although we did not systematically study the Soviet newspaper management experience this time, but only studied Brantman's article "On News Reporting" and a small part of the news on the "Pravda" newspaper, it has played a great role in improving the understanding of news reporting. In the future, we should organize the editorial department staff to systematically study the advanced experience of Soviet newspapers to improve our newspaper work. Finally, it is also very important for the editorial department to pay attention to accumulating various work experiences in the process of business reform. For more than half a year, the comrades of the editorial department have been able to consciously work in accordance with the requirements of improving business in their daily work. However, the editorial department's leadership has not done enough to accumulate experience, especially to analyze and study the large amount of fragmentary experience, systematize it, and further promote business reform on this basis. Every comrade is in contact with new things and new problems every day in their work, and they will inevitably produce new experiences or new difficulties, which are manifested in the work as new progress or temporary stagnation. We lack a specific and deep understanding of these problems, so that good work experience is allowed to slip away lightly, and difficulties that need to be solved urgently have not been grasped and solved in time. In the future, we plan to pay attention to exploring the work experience of each comrade through daily work, and concentrate and promote it.

    我们是怎样改进经济新闻报道的
    东北日报编辑部
    长时期以来，东北日报的新闻报道存在着枯燥、生硬、报道面狭窄的缺点，而又以经济新闻报道表现得最为突出。报纸曾因此不断地受到读者的批评。一九五二年七月，中共中央东北局指示编辑部应改进报道方法，要求报纸全面地、生动地反映党的政策在人民群众中具体化的过程，努力克服上述缺点。编辑部根据这一指示，在九月间召开了记者座谈会，提出“深入实际，深入群众，反映党的政策在群众中具体化的过程”的要求，并组织大家予以贯彻。在以后几个月中，记者采写的新闻通讯虽有了一些改进，但整个报纸并没有基本的转变。一九五三年年初，编辑部就在全年工作计划中把克服新闻报道内容枯燥生硬的缺点，作为全年的改进业务工作的中心，并自四月起组织了以“加强新闻报道、扩大报道面、丰富报道内容”为主要内容的业务学习和业务改革。
    这次业务改革是以改进和加强新闻报道为中心，连带地解决其他问题。因为新闻（包括消息和通讯，其中尤其是消息）是报纸最大量的报道形式，也是报纸特有的宣传武器。运用新闻充分地、及时地、准确地报道对人民群众有教育意义、对实际工作有指导意义的新情况、新事物、新人物和新经验，进行政治鼓动，是扩大报道面、丰富报道内容的有效办法。而在东北日报说来，新闻报道特别是经济新闻报道恰恰又是各种报道形式中薄弱的一环。不但新闻数量少，报道面狭窄，不能反映国家经济建设和人民生活多方面的丰富的内容；并且在新闻写作上，也严重地存在着概念化、公式化、冗长枯燥等等缺点。
    改进和加强经济新闻报道，必须通过学习，统一大家对新闻的作用的认识。为此，我们首先组织编辑部人员学习了有关新闻写作的文章（乔木同志的“人人要学会写新闻”和布朗特曼的“论新闻报道”）和苏联“真理报”上的新闻报道，在编辑部的业务刊物上组织了学习讨论。经过一个阶段的学习，大家初步认识了加强新闻报道的目的和要求，理解了新闻的作用和特点，从而统一了从加强新闻报道入手改进经济宣传的认识。当时也碰到以下的一些思想问题：一种是，满足于老一套的报道方法，把加强新闻报道、扩大报道面、丰富报道内容和指导实际工作对立起来，耽心加强新闻报道会削弱对实际工作的指导作用，因而迟迟不前，怯于改进。在学习初期，这种认识在一部分同志中比较突出。这些同志经过一个时期的学习之后有了若干改变，但还必须经过一个较长时期的实践，在加强新闻报道有了初步成绩之后，才能使问题真正得到解决。这种认识的产生主要是由于对加强新闻报道的意义和作用认识不足，没有明确了解加强新闻报道，充分地、多方面地反映新情况、新事物、新人物和新经验，恰恰是为了加强报道的指导性。一种认识又把报纸的作用理解为只是鼓舞作用，忽视介绍先进经验和报道当前实际工作中的中心问题。这是一种脱离实际的倾向，也是把加强新闻报道和指导实际工作对立起来的表现。另一种认识是，似乎过去的一切都不对头了，抱着一种否定一切的情绪，认为什么都要重新做起。也有一种认识是把加强新闻报道只看作是一种形式上的改进，以为加强新闻报道，不过是要多写些新闻，要写得短些、快些，认为这是比较轻易的事。这说明有些同志没有弄清加强新闻报道是适应新的情况、提高经济宣传的一个重要步骤，首先是宣传内容的改进而不仅是形式的改变，必须提高思想水平，改进组织工作才能做到。因而不是轻而易举的事，恰恰是一件复杂、艰苦的工作。
    为了进一步使全体工作人员认识到新闻的作用，消除上述的种种思想障碍，编辑部接着就在六、七月间分别召开了记者座谈会和编辑座谈会。记者座谈会结合检查过去工作，进行了“如何进一步深入群众、深入生活，结合中心工作加强新闻报道，扩大报道面，丰富报道内容”的讨论。会议批判了有些记者不愿意用新闻及时进行报道而要片面地搞“经验”的做法，和认为加强新闻报道只是形式问题的看法；着重指出要加强新闻报道，必须进一步深入实际，深入群众，这样才能做到及时地反映新情况、新事物、新人物和新经验，正确地深刻地反映党的政策在群众中具体化的过程。根据这次座谈会的精神，我们又提出了“有中心，多方面，写典型，写群众”，作为加强新闻报道的具体要求。编辑座谈会则以如何明确报道思想为主要内容进行了讨论。因为要使经济宣传做到有中心、多方面，并加强经济宣传的政策思想的指导与政治鼓动，就必须在编辑工作人员中间首先明确报道思想，否则一切改进就容易流于形式。报纸自九月以后，根据这两次座谈会中所提出的问题和要求，通过国庆节宣传和增产节约运动的报道，在实践中作了改进。
    半年多以来的业务学习和业务改革，已经收到初步的成效。根据各方面读者的反映，比较显著的改进，首先是在突出报道中心、密切联系实际方面。这本来是东北日报的一个好的工作传统，也是这次业务改革的主要要求之一。在一九五三年第三、第四季度各方面的主要报道中，又都做到了这一点。特别是工业方面增产节约竞赛的报道做到了迅速、集中，对动员群众参加竞赛起了及时的鼓动作用。在报道转向深入时，又连续介绍了五三工厂深入开展竞赛的典型经验，和胡兆森、王崇伦的先进经验，对推动竞赛走向深入也起了很大作用。其次，在总的方面和每一项工作的报道中，主题都比过去广阔了。例如在工业方面，过去很长时期很少反映的地方工业、矿山、森林工业等等，都有了适当的报道。在每一项报道中，也能围绕一个中心，多方面地进行报道。如在阜新海州露天矿开工生产时，我们即抓住工程规模、工人的劳动热情、技术力量的成长、苏联的援助、各地支援等多方面的问题，进行了报道。而在地区上，过去反映较少的吉林、本溪等，现在也在报纸上占了一定的地位。第三，枯燥生硬的缺点有了克服，短小生动的新闻报道增多。例如，对于阜新海州露天矿、鞍山无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂几项重点工程的报道，就是以比较短小、通俗、生动的形式，来宣传了它们的规模和政治经济意义的。每一项工程从将近完工到正式生产，都连续地进行了报道。在发表消息时，并配以通讯、专文、读者来信和图片。过去常见的那种内容繁琐、背景不明、条理不清的新闻大大减少。一般新闻都做到了比较简短、明了，通讯也注意了写过程、写人物。报纸所发表的小品文，增设的短讯汇编、专题集讯（如报道各地职工在竞赛中的创造的专题集讯“发挥生产革新者的首创精神”）等等多样的报道形式，也很受读者欢迎；有的读者并联系小品文中批评的事例，检查了自己的工作。第四，增加了群众活动的报道。我们业务改革的主要要求之一，就是要反映党的政策在群众中具体化的过程，加强群众活动的报道，这在学习后有了比较显著的改进。反映群众活动，最主要的是反映劳动群众在贯彻党的政策、执行国家计划中的创造性劳动和首创精神，宣传先进生产者和他们的先进思想。王崇伦一年完成四年多工作量的报道，就是基于这种认识组织的。关于先进经验的推广，我们过去也是重视的。但这次大张旗鼓地更有计划地报道王崇伦的先进经验，则是经过业务学习，进一步明确了报道思想的结果。另如读者来信组从群众来信中提出的关于“机关式商店”的批评，和“联合运输”、“联合收费站”的合理化建议等，也使报纸增加了群众呼声，增加了生动活泼的气息。读者说：“东北日报不仅在形式上多样化了，同时也反映了社会生活的多样性，更多地反映了群众生活和群众活动。”
    在组织编辑部的业务学习和进行业务改革方面，我们取得了以下的一些经验。
    必须针对工作中的主要问题，使业务学习与改进工作紧密结合。而改进业务又必须根据实际情况，从具体问题入手，制订具体计划，采取一系列的具体措施。一九五一年我们组织过加强思想性的业务学习，问题虽然提得对，大家也积极参加了，但由于缺乏明确的改进目标和具体的改进措施，因而就感到无从下手，收效不大。这次的学习以加强新闻报道为中心，规定了有中心、多方面、写群众、写典型的具体要求；不仅编辑委员会有具体的计划，各业务组也在报道计划中订出具体改进计划，要求这一改革“具体化到每一个人，每一项报道”。此外，并利用编辑部的业务刊物“业务简报”作为推动学习的工具，在刊物上展开讨论、评介。这些具体措施对业务改革起了很大的保证作用。在这些具体措施中，中心环节又是报道计划的制订与实施。许多问题在原则上认识到了，在制订报道计划时发现还并不明确；有些意见在原则上是一致的，但制订报道计划时仍可能发生分歧。因此，制订报道计划一方面是实行业务改革的行动纲领，一方面也是进一步使认识明确、统一思想的重要步骤。
    但是如果只有具体要求和具体措施，而不能从根本上提高认识，那末具体要求也就不易贯彻。我们在一开始虽已认识到，这一业务改革不只是报道方法问题，而首先是报道内容问题，并且归根到底是如何认识报纸在经济建设时期的任务和作用的问题；但是我们在具体贯彻中，对这一点是强调得不够的。在学习过程中，我们也没有在改进宣传特别是经济宣传的一些根本问题上展开深入的讨论，这就不能从思想上充分发动大家，在关键问题上贯彻改进业务的具体措施。当然，改进报纸的经济宣传报道，是一个复杂的问题。既要反对保守不前的倾向，又要防止否定一切、急躁冒进的情绪，同时又不可能要求大家一下子认识明确、思想统一。而必须边学习边改进，逐步深入，在现有基础上，用已经达到的成就（如前述几个比较好的报道）做样子，引导大家逐步提高。
    在这次的业务学习和业务改革中，我们还认识到学习苏联报纸新闻报道的先进经验，对于我们改革业务有重大的启发和帮助。我们这次虽没有系统地学习苏联办报经验，只学习了布朗特曼的文章“论新闻报道”和“真理报”报面上的一小部分新闻，但在提高对新闻报道的认识上已经起了很大的作用。今后，我们应组织编辑部人员系统地学习苏联报纸的先进经验，来改进我们的报纸工作。最后，编辑部注意积累业务改革过程中的各种工作经验，也是很重要的。半年多来，编辑部的同志在日常工作中，都能有意识地按照改进业务的要求进行工作。但是编辑部领导上对于积累经验，特别是从大量的片断的经验中加以分析研究，使它系统化，并在这个基础上来进一步推动业务改革，还是做得不够的。每一个同志在每天的工作中，时刻都接触着新的事物和新的问题，也必然会产生新的体会或新的困难，表现在工作上就是新的进展或暂时的停滞。我们对这些问题缺乏具体的深刻的了解，以致很好的工作经验让它轻轻滑过，亟待解决的困难也没有及时抓住解决。今后，我们准备通过日常工作，经常注意发掘每一个同志的工作经验，并加以集中和推广。
