Farmers in Anhui, Henan, Shandong and other provinces have begun sowing flue-cured tobacco. In Anhui and Henan provinces, early-maturing tobacco has already been sown while the soil is moist, and late-maturing tobacco will also begin to be sown. In the Changwei Special District of Shandong Province, nearly 300 agricultural producers' cooperatives and tens of thousands of mutual aid teams are actively engaged in preparing seedbeds, transporting sand for seedbeds, repairing wells, and preparing manure, to ensure the fulfillment of the state plan for increasing flue-cured tobacco production.

In accordance with the state's policy for developing flue-cured tobacco production this year, Henan Province has decided to focus on increasing the yield of late-maturing tobacco, Shandong Province has proposed selecting seedlings to prevent diseases and summarizing and promoting the application of chemical fertilizer techniques, and Anhui Province has proposed cultivating strong seedlings and popularizing curing techniques, and is preparing to select and hire skilled tobacco growers to conduct technical instruction in new tobacco areas and areas with poor curing techniques. All localities are required to increase yield per unit area by 20.5 percent based on last year's figures. The planting area has also been appropriately expanded in various localities.

In order to help farmers grow tobacco well, Shandong Province has not only provided a large number of waterwheels and other agricultural implements to tobacco areas, but also supplied more than 700 jin of fine tobacco seeds and disease-resistant varieties. By early March, the Changwei Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had supplied 42 million jin of bean cake and more than 10 million jin of chemical fertilizer to tobacco areas. The Xuchang Special District of Henan Province plans to supply more than 47 million jin of bean cake and more than 11 million jin of chemical fertilizer, about 20 times more than last year.

    产烟区农民开始播种烤烟
    安徽、河南、山东等地农民开始播种烤烟。安徽、河南两省的早烟已经趁墒下种，晚烟也将开始播种。山东省昌潍专区有近三百个农业生产合作社和上万个互助组的农民，正在积极进行整理烟畦、搬运烟畦用沙、修理水井和准备粪肥等工作，保证按国家计划完成烤烟增产任务。
    按照今年国家发展烤烟生产的方针，河南省决定以提高晚烟产量为中心环节，山东省提出选苗防病、总结推广化学肥料施用技术，安徽省提出培育壮苗、普及烘烤技术等，并筹备选聘烤烟能手到新烟区及烘烤技术较差地区进行技术传授。各地要求在去年的基础上提高单位面积产量百分之二十点五。种植面积各地也都有适当扩大。
    为了帮助农民种好烤烟，山东省除在烟区大量贷放水车及其它农具外，并供应优良烟种及抗病品种七百余斤。昌潍专区供销合作社在三月上旬已供应烟区豆饼四千二百万斤，化学肥料一千多万斤。河南许昌专区计划供应豆饼四千七百多万斤，化学肥料一千一百多万斤，比去年约多二十倍。
