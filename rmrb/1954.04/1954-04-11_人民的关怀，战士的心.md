　　In March, the spring scenery in the Yunnan border area was at its best. On the 19th, some representatives of the National People's慰問 (comforting) People's Liberation Army Delegation came to a certain unit in the western border of Yunnan.

　　With excitement and gratitude, the representatives, carrying the entrustment of Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country, came to the company, to the squad, and to every soldier, to express Chairman Mao's and the people of the whole country's deep care and warm慰問 (comforts) to these most beloved people. The Zhang Gaolin group went to a炊事 (cooking) squad and inquired with concern about the lives of the border soldiers. The soldiers replied: "Thanks to the support of the motherland, we eat well, dress well, and lack nothing."

　　"How much flour can you eat every month?" Zhang Gaolin asked again. "We can eat steamed buns and dumplings." A cook replied happily.

　　The representatives nodded and smiled.

　　Volunteer Army representative and combat hero Wang Zhanshan always cared about the improvement of the cultural level of his closest comrades-in-arms—the People's Liberation Army. On a table in a certain class, he saw a "Selection of Korean Correspondence Reports." He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. "Ah! Can you all read this now?" he asked excitedly.

　　"Yes, these are all your heroic deeds. They encourage us day and night!" everyone answered him. Wang Zhanshan turned to another table and saw textbooks on algebra and geometry. He said in surprise: "I didn't expect the cultural level of our troops to be raised so high. When I go back, I must tell everyone: the border of the motherland is guarded by our highly cultured and educated elder brothers, which is even more solid than a copper wall."

　　"Compared with your contribution to the motherland, it is still far from enough. We need to continue to improve," the soldier Su Guangming said modestly. At this moment, Li Zhanbiao, a soldier of the minority nationality, grabbed Wang Zhanshan's hand and stuffed the certificate of merit he had obtained in cultural studies into Wang Zhanshan's hand, saying: "Look, this is the culture that the people have given me. I will use my achievements to answer the people." Wang Zhanshan opened the certificate and saw "Arithmetic one hundred points, Chinese one hundred points..." He looked at this ethnic minority comrade-in-arms who was originally illiterate but has now become an excellent student in cultural studies. He was so excited that he couldn't speak. He quickly took off his Chairman Mao commemorative badge and put it on his chest with both hands, saying: "I wish you will always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao and achieve greater achievements."

　　After learning the General Line, the comrades who打炮眼 (drilling holes for explosives) and炸石头的 (blasting rocks) deeply realized that steel tools did not come easily. So, the Li Guangfu group saved every sliver of iron filings that collapsed from the steel drill. In two months, they picked up seven liang and four qian of broken iron filings. At this moment, Comrade Li Guangfu put these iron filings in a small red cloth bag and presented them to his relatives, asking them to pass them on to the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant. The red cloth bag reads: "Although there is not much, it is also support for the construction of the motherland." How touching is the noble quality of the border soldiers caring for and supporting the construction of the motherland!

　　The soldiers love the motherland, and the representatives sent by the motherland also love them even more. The representatives must see every soldier with their own eyes. They sometimes ran to the stables to shake hands with the soldiers who were feeding the horses, and sometimes ran to the kitchen to talk to the soldiers who were cooking; and they did not hesitate to travel back and forth to various construction sites to meet with the comrades who were sticking to their work. There was a seventeen-year-old soldier named Zhou Guiliu, who was starting a fire in a brick kiln, and thought:
　　"It seems that I can't see my relatives!" However, representatives Wang Zhanshan, Zhang Gaolin, Wang Chengjian, Li Wenwu, etc., all successively drilled into the kiln door to shake hands with him and say hello, which moved him so much that he didn't know what to say. He only repeated one sentence: "Serve the people!" After the representatives left the kiln, they were all covered in sweat and black ash, but they said: "Only in this way can we feel at ease."

　　In a certain class, the soldiers and representatives talked and laughed. They talked about the border, about Korea, about Beijing and the motherland, and about the future of the world. They said: "Every tunnel in Korea, every trench on the border of the motherland, every workshop in the factory, and every mu of cultivated land in the countryside, all lead to Tiananmen Square and to the socialist society of the motherland."

　　"We love peace, and for it, we will always actively defend the socialist construction of the motherland." This is the voice of the border soldiers.

    人民的关怀，战士的心
    陈英
    三月，在云南边疆正是春光明媚的时节。十九日，全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团的部分代表来到了云南西部边境的某部了。
    代表们怀着兴奋感激的心情，带着毛主席和全国人民的嘱托，来到了连队，来到了班，来到了每一个战士的面前，向这些最可爱的人表达毛主席和全国人民对他们的深切关怀和热烈慰问。张高林小组到了一个炊事班，关切地询问边疆战士的生活。战士们答道：“由于祖国的支援，我们吃得好穿得好，什么也不缺。”
    “每月能吃多少面？”张高林又问。“馒头饺子都吃得上”。一个炊食员很快活地回答。
    代表们点头微笑了。
    志愿军代表、战斗英雄王占山，处处关心着他最亲密的战友——解放军文化水平提高的情况，在某班的桌子上，他看到一本“朝鲜通讯报告选”，他乐的合不上嘴，“啊！你们都可以读这个了吗？”他兴奋地问着。
    “是啊，都是你们的英雄事迹，它日日夜夜在鼓舞着我们呢！”大家回答了他。王占山转身到另一个桌前，看到的是代数、几何课本，他十分惊讶地说：“想不到咱们部队的文化水平提的这样高了，我回去，一定要告诉大家：祖国边疆有着我们高度文化教养的老大哥守卫着，比铜墙铁壁还要牢靠。”
    “比起你们对祖国的贡献来说，还差的很远呢？还需要继续提高。”战士苏光明谦逊地说。就在这时，民家族战士李占标拉住王占山的手，把自己获得的文化学习成绩优良证塞在王占山的手里，说：“你瞧，这是人民给我的文化，我要用成绩回答人民。”王占山把证书打开一看，里面写着“算术一百分，语文一百分。……”他看着这位原来一字不识，而现在却成为文化学习优等生的兄弟民族战友激动得说不出话来，他连忙取下自己的毛主席纪念章，双手给他戴在胸前说：“祝你永远当个毛主席的好战士，获得更大的成就。”
    学了总路线以后打炮眼，炸石头的同志们，深刻地认识到钢铁工具来得不容易，于是，李光福小组就把从钢钎上打崩下来的每一丝铁屑都积攒起来。两个月的光景，他们拾得了碎铁屑七斤四两。这会儿，李光福同志把这些铁屑装在一个小红布袋里，献给亲人，请亲人们转给鞍山炼钢厂的工友们。红布袋上写着：“虽然东西不多，但也是支援祖国建设。”边疆战士关怀和支援祖国建设的崇高品质是多么感动人啊！
    战士们热爱祖国，祖国派来的代表，也更加热爱他们。代表们一定要亲眼看到每个战士。他们有时跑到马棚里，和正在喂马的战士握手，有时跑到厨房里，和正在炒菜的战士谈话；而且不辞劳苦，往返在各个工地，和坚持工作的同志们见面。有一个十七岁的战士周贵刘，正在砖窑里生火，心想：
  “可见不着亲人了！”但是，代表王占山、张高林、王承鉴、李文武等，却都先后钻进窑门去跟他握手，问好，感动得他就不知说什么好。他只反复地说着一句话：“为人民服务！”代表们出窑后，都出了一身汗，糊了一身黑灰，但他们却说：“这样我们心里才过得去。”
    在某班，战士和代表们谈着笑着，他们从边疆谈到朝鲜，从北京和祖国谈到了世界的未来。他们说：“朝鲜的每一条坑道，祖国边防线上的每一条壕沟，祖国工厂的每一个车间和农村每一亩耕地，都通向天安门广场，通到祖国的社会主义社会。”
    “我们热爱和平，为了它，我们永远积极地保卫祖国的社会主义建设。”这就是边防战士们的心声。
