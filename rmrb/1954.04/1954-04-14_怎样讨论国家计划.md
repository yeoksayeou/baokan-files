How to Discuss the National Plan
By Our Reporter An Gang

Currently, factories are discussing the national plan. According to the situation in Harbin factories, some are preparing for the discussion, some are waiting for plans from higher authorities, some have already discussed the quarterly plan, and a few have completed the discussion of the national plan. The Northeast Daily published an article on March 29th entitled "Seriously Break Down Conservative Thinking and Ensure the Advanced Nature of This Year's Industrial Production Plan," which pointed out: "Judging from the preliminary indicators of the annual plans proposed by various production factories and mines in Northeast China this year... the planned indicators (output, quality, cost) of many factories are lower than the actual levels achieved last year. This is not in line with the requirements of the general line." The article calls on factories to continue studying the Party's general line during the transition period during the discussion of the national plan, link it to inspections, criticize conservative thinking, fully mobilize workers, conduct in-depth investigations into the production process to explore potential, and raise certain backward indicators to advanced levels.

Why are the indicators set low?

If you ask any leader of these enterprises, they can cite several reasons to prove the correctness of the "low" indicators. Similarly, you can find countless contradictory facts to prove the incorrectness of the "low" indicators. If we study the basic lessons of this issue, based on my observations in Harbin, the basic reason is that the factories did not promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses when drafting the initial plan, organize mass discussions, and transform every indicator into an advanced indicator in accordance with the requirements of the national general line. Some leaders believe: "Lower figures can be balanced," "It's better to set lower figures now, and then raise them when the plan approved by the state is handed over to the masses for discussion." This is not appropriate. Now the higher-level economic organs issue plans relatively late. After the factories wait for the plans to be issued, and then organize bottom-up discussions, the entire second quarter is submerged in the "sea of discussion." A lot of production work has to be concentrated in the third and fourth quarters for a rush, creating an extremely unbalanced situation in production.

What is the situation of Soviet enterprises discussing plans? According to Soviet experts: In the Soviet Union, factories generally formulate and approve production and financial plans before the year begins. Factories start drafting the production and financial plan for the coming year in the fall, and mobilize workers for discussion during the drafting process. The factory's plan for the coming year is generally based on the norms of September and October of the current year, and an advanced plan is formulated after mass discussion. Once approved by the state, there is no need to re-discuss it, but rather to focus on mobilizing employees to propose guarantee conditions and measures, formulate welcome plans (i.e., China's increased production and conservation plans) and carry out competitions. Soviet factories attach great importance to organizing worker discussions in the preparation of plans. This ensures that the enterprise submits an advanced and reasonable plan to the state, and also prevents the work of discussing the plan from being dragged into the next year, affecting the completion of the plan and the launch of competitions.

Currently, our factories all organize workers to discuss plans after the higher authorities approve them. This was also the case during the Sino-Soviet joint administration period of the China Changchun Railway (hereinafter referred to as the Sino-Soviet joint administration period). However, they have a relatively complete set of experiences for organizing the masses to systematically discuss the nationally approved plan. Now, with reference to the needs of various places, I would like to raise some issues worthy of reference and learning.

What is the purpose?

When our factories hand over the plan to the workers for discussion, the slogan often put forward is "Find tricks and tap potential," "Deep dig and fine search," which is correct. However, some places only pay attention to mobilizing workers to find tricks and are satisfied with the numbers of the tricks they find. They have not guided employees to seriously study the content of the plan itself, resulting in "Thousands of tricks, but the plan is not completed." During the Sino-Soviet joint administration period, the discussion of the national plan first involved letting workers, engineers, technicians, and staff understand the significance and content of the plan, the workload of the plan (including quantity, quality), and repeatedly explaining the production tasks assigned by the state to the employees. This is not enough. More importantly, it is necessary to make workers aware of the specific tasks they are responsible for in the common task. Everyone, regardless of the size of their responsibilities, understands their responsibility in completing the national task, consciously thinks of ways to complete and overfulfill the plan assigned by the state. At the same time, because they know the overall content of the plan, each department, workshop, work section, and group can strengthen mutual connections under a common goal in performing national tasks. Discussing the plan is a serious political task. During the Sino-Soviet joint administration period, the factory paid special attention to establishing the overall concept of completing national tasks among employees when discussing the plan. Many of our factories cannot fully complete the tasks, not because every department is not working well, but often because a department, a group, or even an individual fails to complete the plan, which affects the completion of the entire national plan. This kind of fact is very common. For example, the foundry and forging workshops have completed the plan in terms of tonnage, but not in terms of variety. However, the assembly workshop needs variety, not tonnage. On the surface, the foundry and forging workshops have completed the plan, but in fact, the failure to complete the variety plan undermines the completion of the entire enterprise plan. When manufacturing machines, bearings and bushings are needed. If a bearing or bushing is not made well, it will only be discovered when the machine is assembled and test-run. It has to be re-scraped, ground, or replaced. This rework seems small, but because the entire machine has to be disassembled, it often affects the product from leaving the factory on schedule. When employees discuss the plan, they cannot lower the plan, let alone bargain. Every link and everyone must proceed from the overall interests of the country, propose their own conditions and measures to ensure the overfulfillment of national tasks, help each other, and strive to fully complete the tasks and indicators stipulated by the state.

What to Discuss?

What to discuss? Everyone knows that it is discussing the plan. However, many factories only put forward the general statement of "Mobilize everyone to discuss the plan," and send the plan to the workshops and departments for discussion, while the leading cadres are listening to reports from the sidelines. The experience during the Sino-Soviet joint administration period was a further step. They want everyone to participate in the discussion without exception. The discussion method is from top to bottom, first cadres, then workers.

The discussion is generally divided into three categories: The first category is a comprehensive discussion of the plan by the factory's leading cadres and the leading cadres of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League. First, the head of the planning section and the chief accountant make a detailed explanation of each section and article of the national plan (the head of the planning section and the chief accountant must know the details of the plan very clearly). According to their introduction, everyone discusses each chapter and section of the plan, and proposes various measures to ensure the implementation of the plan. The second category is discussion by workshop, led by workshop leading cadres (including workshop directors, engineers, technicians, economic planners, accountants, Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres). The workshop economic planner and accountant make a plan report. When discussing the plan of this workshop, it is necessary to study it item by item, the more specific the better. The above is the discussion of leading cadres. Only when leading cadres discuss deeply and meticulously can they have a clear understanding and lead workers to discuss the plan. The main reason why some factories' plan discussion work falls into laissez-faire is that leading cadres have not seriously discussed the plan. The third category is to organize workers to discuss. At the workshop workers' meeting, the workshop director introduces the overall production and financial plan and the workshop production and financial plan in detail. During the Sino-Soviet joint administration period, factories already had various consumption quotas. Therefore, when workers discuss the production plan, they can discuss various consumption quotas (such as labor, materials, fuel, electricity, and other consumption quotas) according to various expenses and products to ensure that the new quota is lower than the original quota standard. If the workshop group does not have quotas, it can also organize workers to discuss how to improve production efficiency, save expenses, improve quality, and reduce expenditures. In the discussion of the plan, enterprise leaders should be good at listening to and accepting the opinions of workers. Soviet experts said: "All the opinions put forward by workers, no matter how big or small, should be recorded in full. Leaders should pay great attention to every opinion, even if it is very small but useful, and accept and organize its implementation quickly, not only to implement it, but also to implement it as soon as possible." Delaying and failing to deal with it is to dampen the enthusiasm of the workers. If the leadership accepts and implements the small suggestions of the workers, the workers will use their brains to put forward bigger and better opinions. The more suggestions workers put forward, the more carefully the leadership analyzes and studies them, and they will find the tricks and keys to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan.

Discussion Steps

Now many factories put forward a slogan when discussing the plan called "Department personnel go down to the workshop." This sentence is good in itself. During the Sino-Soviet joint administration period, as soon as Soviet experts arrived at the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory, they proposed that department personnel should face the workshop. All department work is based on workshop production as the object of their work. At that time, an employee was working on official documents at the table every day. When the workshop had an emergency to solve, he said: "I'm too busy to go down." A Soviet expert (section chief) helped him lock the official documents in the drawer and asked him to go down to breathe the air of production. In the past, technical personnel did not go to the workshop. The technical operation process transformation plan arranged by Soviet experts stipulated that technical personnel should not sit in the room and think about drawings, but go to the workshop to combine with the workers, investigate the workers' production actions, summarize the workers' labor experience and raise it to the level of advanced working methods. Department work must constantly take root in the workshop year after year and combine with the daily production labor of the workers. However, when some factories discuss the plan, they find that there are not enough materials, and only temporarily send department personnel to the workshop to investigate and determine. If the department staff all run to the workshop to help with the work, it will be impossible to fully discuss the national plan and the work of each department in completing the national plan, which will make the department a weak link in the year's work. It is very important for the department to discuss the national plan. For example, in addition to discussing and studying the overall production tasks and total workload of the entire factory, the equipment section should also discuss the investment plan and major repair plan in more detail; in addition to discussing the overall production tasks of the factory, the accounting section personnel should also carefully discuss the financial revenue and expenditure plan, the product sales plan, and the product indirect expense budget plan. If the department does not discuss the national plan well, it will definitely affect the factory's overall completion of the annual plan.

Discussion of the plan must be carried out step by step. According to Soviet experts, the steps for factories to discuss the national plan during the Sino-Soviet joint administration period are:

Step 1: First, each department studies in detail the parts of the plan related to the department and discusses specific action plans.

Step 2: According to the factory's overall plan, each department drafts plans for each workshop related to the department. When drafting workshop plans in Soviet factories, it is necessary to include the workshop's project-by-project, product-by-product, consumption quotas, and other indirect expense quotas. Some factories currently do not have such quotas, and approximate quotas should also be formulated, or rough quotas should be formulated based on past statistical materials to give the workshop a goal to strive for.

Step 3: The economic planning section summarizes the workshop plans related to each department drafted by each department to make the factory's overall workshop plan. Then compare it with the national approved plan indicators. The workshop's plan must be higher than the national approved plan. In the Soviet Union, it is not allowed for the plans of various workshops to be lower than the national approved plan.

When the economic planning section summarizes the overall plan of the factory based on the information provided by each department, it must absorb the participation of the economic planners of each workshop. Because: 1. The economic planners of the workshop have a thorough understanding of the situation of the workshop, and some situations cannot be seen by the economic planning section. 2. The economic planners of each workshop help the economic planning section to prepare the overall workshop plan, which can quickly issue the overall plan to the workshop without delay. 3. The economic planners of the workshop participate in the preparation and research of the overall plan, and also participate in the preparation and research of the plan of their own workshop. They fully understand the content of the plan, so it is easy to issue the plan to their own workshop.

Step 4: Organize workshop cadres to study the workshop plan issued by the factory. The number of participants should not be too many. Workshop directors, deputy directors, foremen (work section chiefs), engineers, technicians, and accounting personnel should participate. The economic planner leads the study and research. Why is the economic planner leading the study and research? Because he participated in the preparation of the overall plan and understands the content of the workshop plan. In the discussion of the plan, workshop cadres must formulate overall measures to complete the plan of their own workshop, and also divide up the group plans of the workshop.

Step 5: Prepare the plans for each work section, which should be prepared based on the workshop plan. When preparing the group plan, the workshop director or deputy director and relevant foremen and some engineers and technicians should participate.

Step 6: When the group workers study the plan of their own group, the foreman of the group leads the study. The workshop economic planner and engineers and technicians help the workers study. The economic planner should participate in the most important work sections, and the engineers and technicians can participate in various groups separately.

After each group of workers has clearly understood the content of the plan, they begin to discuss the plan. The main discussions are: what methods to use to complete the plan; how to allocate labor; what methods can be used to overfulfill the plan, reduce product costs, improve quality, and improve production efficiency, and formulate a plan that is higher than the task required by the factory.

Step 7: After each work section discusses the plan, they must summarize the plans of each work section and the guarantee conditions proposed into the overall plan of the workshop. This work is the responsibility of the workshop director, deputy director, foremen, engineers, technicians, economic planners, accountants, etc.

Step 8: Convene a workshop workers' meeting to pass the summarized workshop plan at the workshop meeting. Propose workshop guarantee measures and increase production and conservation plans.

Step 9: Each workshop submits the workshop's increased production and conservation plan to the economic planning section, which is summarized by the economic planning section, and the factory leadership cadres discuss and study it, and propose the factory's guarantee conditions, the factory's measures, and the factory's increased production and conservation plan.

Step 10: Convene a factory-wide meeting to pass and supplement the factory-wide guarantee conditions and increased production and conservation plan.

The order of plan review is: each group submits the results of the plan discussion to the workshop review committee. The review committee is attended by the workshop director, deputy director, the heads of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League, the workshop economic planner, and the chief accountant. After the group plan is summarized and reviewed by the workshop review committee, it is submitted to the economic planning section, which is summarized and submitted to the factory review committee. The factory review committee is composed of the factory director, the Party committee secretary, the chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, the head of the economic planning section, the head of the accounting section, the head of the production scheduling section, etc. When necessary, other section chiefs and relevant personnel also participate.

The contents of the plans drawn up by the group, workshop, and factory are different: the group's plan is specific and detailed; the workshop's plan only summarizes the main methods and guarantee conditions for completing the plan of the workshop; the factory's plan includes the main indicators, projects, and measures.

There are many benefits to discussing in the above order. First, the discussion is conducted from top to bottom with leadership. Before the workshop discussion, the departments have made thorough preparations and provided detailed information for the workshop staff to discuss, so that the workshop discussion will not be laissez-faire, and it also saves the workers' discussion time. Second, the departments and workshops base themselves on the national plan, discuss in detail, and study what specific measures to take to ensure completion. After summarizing, it becomes a factory-wide detailed action plan; third, the economic planning section of the factory and the economic planners of the workshop preside over the study, which can help leading cadres better understand the content and indicators of the plan. After the study, they discuss how to do it, which prevents blind and unfocused rambling; fourth, the guarantee conditions of each group and the workshop guarantee measures are concentrated to form factory-wide guarantee measures, and a call is made to launch a competition to realize the guarantee conditions, which achieves the goal of coming from the masses and going to the masses, and strengthens the combination of leadership and the masses.

The Role of the Party

The Party organization should provide political guarantees and supervision in the discussion of the plan in accordance with each of the steps listed above. In terms of guarantees, the main responsibility of the Party organization is to conduct full political mobilization both inside and outside the Party, to ensure that a series of plan discussion meetings are held well, and to mobilize employees to propose conditions and measures to ensure the overfulfillment of the national plan. When discussing the plan, the Party and the trade union should promote advanced thinking, commend advanced figures, eliminate various ideological obstacles that may occur, and mobilize and organize the masses to find tricks, tap potential, and actively propose ways to overfulfill the plan. The Party organization cannot be satisfied with the figures for completing the plan, because completing the plan is everyone's responsibility to the country. The Party organization should carefully study and analyze the various potentials that still exist in the factory, and encourage workers to consciously improve the increased production and conservation plan
(The Soviet Union calls it the welcome plan, that is, the plan to overfulfill the plan in addition to completing the national task).

During the Sino-Soviet joint administration period, the Ministry of Railways ordered the factory to manufacture heavy-duty vehicles. At that time, the factory had great difficulties, the workers had never made new vehicles, and the equipment was not complete. In the face of this arduous task, the leaders of the factory from China and the Soviet Union did not raise any difficulties, but accepted the task assigned by the higher authorities as the most lofty honor. They submitted the task to the masses for discussion in accordance with the above steps. The guarantee conditions and measures finally proposed by the employees could not only fully complete the task of manufacturing heavy-duty vehicles, but also make 20 more vehicles, and as a result, they completed the task ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. In 1953, after the employees discussed the total output value of the production task assigned to the factory by the Ministry of Railways, they proposed a total output value plan that increased by 68 billion yuan compared with the national plan. This kind of increased production and conservation plan was not proposed out of thin air, but proposed specific quantities according to product varieties, and proposed ways to compress various consumption quotas according to the quota standards stipulated by the Ministry of Railways, so it was sure to be completed. The higher authorities once gave the factory a new task outside the annual plan. The relevant departments of the factory were afraid of not completing the task and proposed a plan to increase manpower. The leadership submitted the plan to the workers for discussion. The workers proposed methods and measures to improve labor productivity and ensure the completion of the task without increasing manpower. The role of the Party is concrete and realistic. The more practical, specific, and advanced the plan proposed by the masses, the more in-depth and powerful the Party's work will be.

The Party organization should adhere to correct principles in the discussion of the plan, carry out political supervision, and correct deviations at any time. The most important thing is to supervise the administrative department to correctly treat the various initiatives and opinions of the workers. If it is found that the opinions of the workers are ignored or the handling is delayed, criticism and correction should be made in a timely manner, which has a direct relationship to improving the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in the discussion of the plan. In the discussion of the plan, some people may propose blind and impractical rushing plans. On the one hand, the Party organization should publicize those practical and reasonable plans to the masses so that everyone understands that improving the plan must be based on evidence and cannot rely solely on subjective wishes. On the other hand, it is necessary to earnestly and patiently persuade and educate those who propose rushing plans, pointing out that his plan has no real basis and helping him propose a reasonable plan. All phenomena of improving the plan without starting from reality must be stopped in a timely manner. Otherwise, the Party will become tailism in politics, but when persuading, a very cautious attitude should be adopted, and rough methods should not be used. Do not pour cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses.

    怎样讨论国家计划
    本报记者　安岗
    现在各工厂正在讨论国家计划，根据哈尔滨各工厂情况，有的正在作讨论计划的准备工作，有的正在等待上级的计划，有的已经讨论了季度计划，个别工厂已讨论完国家计划。三月二十九日东北日报发表的“认真打破保守思想，保证今年工业生产计划的先进性”一文指出：“从东北各生产厂矿今年提出的全年计划初步指标来看……有不少工厂的计划指标（产量、质量、成本），都低于去年实际达到的水平。这是和总路线的要求不相适应的。”文中要求各工厂在讨论国家计划的过程中继续学习党在过渡时期的总路线，联系检查，批判保守思想，充分发动职工，深入生产过程调查发掘潜力，把某些落后的指标提高到先进的水平。
    为什么指标订得低了呢？
    随便你问这些企业的那一个领导者，他都可以举出若干理由，证明“低”的正确。同样地，你可以找到无数相互矛盾的事实来证明“低”的不正确。如果研究这个问题的基本教训，根据我在哈尔滨的观察，基本原因是在工厂编制初步计划时没有发扬群众积极性创造性，组织群众讨论，把每一个指标都按照国家总路线要求变为先进的指标。有些领导人认为：“低一点可以均衡”，“现在订得低一点，等到国家批准的计划交给群众讨论时再提高。”这是不妥当的。现在上级经济机关发出计划都比较晚，工厂等计划发来后再组织自下而上的讨论，整个第二季度就被淹没在“讨论”的大海中。很多的生产工作只好集中在第三第四季度去突击，造成了生产上极大的不均衡的局面。
    苏联企业讨论计划的情况是怎样呢？据苏联专家谈：在苏联，工厂制订和批准生产财务计划一般都在年度以前。工厂在秋季就编制来年的生产财务计划，编制过程中就发动工人讨论，工厂编制的来年计划一般以不低于本年九、十月份的定额为依据，经过群众讨论后，制订出先进的计划。等到国家批准下来，就不需要再重新讨论，而是把重点放在发动职工提保证条件和措施，订迎接计划（即我国的增产节约计划）和开展竞赛了。苏联工厂非常重视在编制计划中组织工人讨论，这样就可以保证企业向国家提出的是先进的合理的计划，同时，也使讨论计划的工作不致拖到来年，影响完成计划和开展竞赛。
    现在我们各个工厂都是等待上级批准计划后，再组织工人讨论。中长铁路时期（即指中长铁路中苏共管时期，下同）哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂也是如此，但他们对于组织群众系统讨论国家批准的计划有着一套比较完整的经验，现特参照各地需要，提出一些值得参考和学习的问题。
      目的何在？
    我们各工厂把计划交给工人讨论时，经常提出的口号是“找窍门，挖潜力”，“深挖细找”，这是对的。但有些地方只注意了发动工人找窍门，满足于找出来的窍门数字。却没有引导职工认真学习计划本身的内容，结果是“窍门千千万，计划完不成”。中长铁路时期，讨论国家计划首先是让工人、工程技术人员、职员了解计划的意义、内容，计划的工作量（包括数量、质量），反复地向职工交代国家交给的生产任务，这还不够，更重要的是要使工人知道自己在共同任务中所担负的具体任务。每个人不论职责大小，都明白自己在完成国家任务中应尽的责任，自觉地想办法完成和超额完成国家交给的计划，同时由于知道了总的计划内容，在执行国家任务中，各部门、车间、工段、小组都能够在共同目标下加强相互联系。讨论计划是一个严重的政治工作。中长铁路时期，工厂在讨论计划时，特别注意在职工中树立完成国家任务的整体观念。我们很多工厂不能全面完成任务，并不是由于每一个部门工作都不好，常常是一个部门，一个小组甚至一个人完不成计划就影响了整个国家计划的完成，这种事实是很多的。譬如铸工、锻冶车间按吨数都完成了计划，按品种却没有完成，可是装配车间要的是品种而不是吨数，表面看来，铸工、锻冶车间是完成了计划，实际上由于品种计划没完成就破坏了整个企业计划的完成。在制造机器时要用轴承轴瓦，一个轴承轴瓦制作得不好，到了机器装好试运转时才发现有毛病，只得重新刮、研或换新的。这个返工似乎很小，但因要把整个机器拆开，往往影响产品不能按计划日期出厂。职工讨论计划时，不能降低计划，更不能要价还价，每一个环节和每一个人都要从国家整体利益出发，为保证超额完成国家任务提出自己的条件和措施，互相协助，争取全面完成国家规定的任务和指标。
    讨论什么？
    讨论什么？谁都知道，是讨论计划。但，有不少工厂却只是笼统地提“发动大家讨论计划”，把计划发到车间科室去讨论，领导干部却是在一旁听汇报。中长铁路时期的经验是更进了一步。他们要每一个人毫无例外地参加讨论。讨论的方式是自上而下，先干部，后工人。
    讨论一般分三类：第一类是工厂厂部领导干部及党、工会、青年团领导干部在一起全面讨论计划。首先由计划科长和总会计对国家计划逐节逐条作详细的解说（计划科长和总会计要对计划大小细节都知道得非常清楚），根据他们的介绍，大家按照计划书逐章逐节地进行讨论，提出各种保证实现计划的措施；第二类是以车间为单位，由车间领导干部（包括车间主任，工程技术人员，经济计划员，会计员，党、工会、青年团干部）讨论，车间经济计划员、会计员作计划报告，在讨论本车间计划时要逐条逐项研究，越具体越好，以上是领导干部的讨论。领导干部讨论得深刻、细致，才能作到心中有数，领导工人讨论计划。有些工厂讨论计划工作陷于自流，主要原因就是领导干部没有对计划作认真的讨论。第三类是组织工人讨论，在车间工人大会上由车间主任详细介绍总的生产财务计划和车间生产财务计划。中长铁路时期工厂已有各种消耗定额，因此，工人讨论生产计划时，可以按各项费用、产品分别讨论各项消耗定额（如劳动力、材料、燃料、电力及其他消耗定额），保证新的定额一定低于原有的定额标准。如果车间小组没有定额，也可以组织工人讨论如何提高生产效率，节约经费，提高质量，减少支出。在讨论计划中，企业领导者要善于倾听和接受工人的意见，苏联专家说：“对工人所提的意见不论大小都要全部记录下来。领导者要十分重视每一个那怕是很小但是有益的意见，要迅速地接受并组织实现，不但要实现，而且要实现得越快越好。”拖拖拉拉不处理，就是打击工人的热情，领导上接受和实现了工人小的建议，工人就会动脑筋把更大更好的意见提出来。工人提的建议越多，领导上认真分析研究，就会找到保证完成和超额完成国家计划的窍门和关键。
      讨论的步骤
    现在很多工厂在讨论计划时提出一个口号叫做“科室人员下车间”，这句话本来是不错的。中长铁路时期，苏联专家一到哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂，就提出要科室人员面向车间。一切科室工作都以车间生产作为自己工作的对象。当时有位职员天天伏在桌子上办公文，车间有紧急事要他解决，他说：“忙的要死，下不去。”一位苏联专家（科长）帮助他把公文锁在抽屉里，请他下去呼吸生产的空气。过去技术人员不下车间，苏联专家布置的改造技术作业过程方案就规定要技术人员不是坐在屋里望天花板想图样，而是到车间去同工人结合在一起，考察工人的生产动作，总结工人的劳动经验并把它提高到先进的工作方法的水平。科室的工作要经年不断地把根子扎到车间，同工人日常的生产劳动相结合。可是，有些工厂到了讨论计划时候，发现材料不够，才临时派科室人员下车间去查定，科室的工作人员都跑到车间去帮助工作，就不可能充分地讨论国家计划和每个科在完成国家计划中的工作，这就会使科室在一年的工作中成为一个薄弱环节。科室讨论国家计划非常重要，例如设备科除讨论和研究全厂总的生产任务，总的工作量外，还应更详细地讨论投资计划和大修计划；会计科人员除讨论工厂总的生产任务外，还应仔细讨论财务收支计划，产品销售计划和产品间接费预算计划，科室对国家计划讨论得不好，一定会影响工厂全面完成全年计划。
    讨论计划一定要有步骤地进行。据苏联专家谈，中长铁路时期工厂讨论国家计划的步骤是：
    第一步、首先各科详细研究与本科有关的计划部分，讨论具体的行动计划。
    第二步、各科根据工厂总的计划，拟出与本科有关的各个车间的计划。在苏联工厂编制车间计划时，一定要包括这个车间的项目别、产品别、消耗定额及其他各项间接费定额。目前有些工厂没有这样定额，也应制订近似的或根据过去统计材料订出概略的定额，使车间有奋斗目标。
    第三步、由经济计划科汇总各科所拟定的与本科有关的车间计划，作出全厂总的车间计划。再与国家批准的计划指标核对，车间的计划一定较国家批准的计划高一些。在苏联来说，不允许各车间的计划比国家批准的计划低。
    经济计划科根据各科提出的资料，汇总工厂总的计划时，一定要吸收各车间经济计划员参加。因为：一、车间经济计划员对车间情况了解的透彻，有些情况是经济计划科看不到的。二、各车间经济计划员帮助经济计划科编制总的车间计划，就能使总的计划迅速下达车间，不致耽误时间。三、车间经济计划员参加了总的计划编制和研究工作，同时也参加了本车间的计划编制和研究工作，他们充分了解了计划的内容，因而便于向本车间下达计划。
    第四步、组织车间干部学习工厂发下来的车间计划，参加研究的人不要太多，应由车间主任、副主任、各领工员（工长）、工程技术人员及会计人员参加。由经济计划员来领导学习研究，为什么由经济计划员来领导学习研究呢？因为他参加了总的计划编制，了解了本车间计划内容。车间干部在讨论计划中，要作出为完成本车间计划的总措施，另外要分劈出车间的小组计划。
    第五步、编制各工段计划，要根据车间计划来编制，在编制小组计划时要由车间主任或副主任及有关的领工员和某些工程技术人员参加。
    第六步、小组工人学习本组计划时，由本组领工员来领导学习。车间经济计划员、工程技术人员来帮助工人学习。经济计划员要参加最主要的工段，各个小组可由工程技术人员分别参加。
    各组工人确实明白了计划内容，就开始讨论计划。主要讨论：用什么办法完成计划；怎样配备劳动力；用什么办法可以超额完成计划，降低产品成本，提高质量，提高生产效率，拟定出比工厂要求的任务为高的计划。
    第七步、各工段讨论计划后，就要把各工段计划和提出的保证条件，汇总成为车间总的计划。这项工作由车间正、副主任、各领工员、工程技术人员、经济计划员、会计人员等负责汇总。
    第八步、召开车间工人大会，在车间会议上通过所汇总的车间计划。提出车间的保证措施和增产节约计划。
    第九步、各车间将车间增产节约计划，提交给经济计划科，由经济计划科汇总，厂部领导干部进行讨论研究，提出全厂保证条件，全厂措施和全厂的增产节约计划。
    第十步、召开全厂大会，通过和补充全厂的保证条件和增产节约计划。
    计划审查的次序是：各个小组将讨论计划的结果，提交车间审查委员会。审查委员会由车间正、副主任，党、工会、青年团负责人，车间经济计划员，主任会计员参加，小组计划经车间审查委员会汇总审查后交经济计划科，经济计划科汇总后交厂部审查委员会。厂部审查委员会由厂长、党委书记、工会主席、团委书记、经济计划科长、会计科长、生产调度科长等人组成，必要时，其他科长和有关人员也参加。
    小组、车间、厂部订的计划内容是有区别的：小组的计划具体、细致；车间的计划只汇总本车间完成计划的主要方法，保证条件；厂部的计划则包括主要指标、项目、措施。
    按照以上次序进行讨论，好处很多。第一、从上到下有领导地进行讨论，在车间讨论前，就由科室作了周密的准备工作，给车间员工讨论提供了细致的资料，这样使车间讨论不致形成自流，也节省了工人讨论的时间。第二、科室、车间以国家计划为基础，详细讨论，研究本部门采取什么具体措施来保证完成，汇总后，就成了一个全厂性的详细的行动计划；第三、由厂部经济计划科和车间经济计划员主持学习，可以帮助领导干部更好地了解计划的内容及指标，学习后，才讨论怎样干，这就防止了盲目的不着边际的漫谈；第四、把每一小组的保证条件、车间保证措施集中起来作出全厂保证措施，并号召展开竞赛，实现保证条件，这就做到了从群众中来，到群众中去，加强了领导与群众的结合。
      党的作用
    党组织在讨论计划中要按照上述列举的每一步骤从政治上进行保证和监督。在保证方面，党组织的责任主要是在党内外进行充分的政治动员，保证开好一系列讨论计划的会议，动员职工提出保证超额完成国家计划的条件和措施。在讨论计划时，党和工会要发扬先进思想，表扬先进人物，清除可能发生的各种思想障碍，动员组织群众找窍门，挖潜力，积极提出超额完成计划的办法。党组织不能满足于完成计划的数字，因为，完成计划是每个人对国家应尽的责任。党组织要仔细研究分析工厂还存在的各种潜力，鼓励工人自觉地提高增产节约计划
  （苏联称之为迎接计划，即除完成国家任务外超额完成的计划）。
    中长铁路时期，铁道部命令工厂制造重型车。当时工厂困难很大，工人都没有做过新造车，设备也不齐全。工厂苏中两国领导同志在这一艰巨任务面前，没有提出任何困难，而是把上级交给的任务当作最崇高的荣誉接受下来。他们把任务按照上述步骤提交群众讨论。职工最后提的保证条件和措施不但可以全部完成制造重型车的任务，而且还要多做二十辆，结果提前超额完成了任务。一九五三年职工讨论铁道部给工厂生产任务总产值后，提出比国家计划增加了六百八十亿元的总产值计划。这种增产节约的计划不是凭空提的，而是按产品品种提出具体数量，并按铁道部规定的定额标准提出压缩各项消耗定额的办法，因此，是有把握完成的。上级曾给这个工厂增加了年度计划外的新任务，厂部有关科室害怕完不成任务，提出增加人的计划，领导上把计划提交工人讨论，工人提出了提高劳动生产率的方法和措施，保证在不增加人的情况下完成任务。党的作用是具体的和现实的，群众提出的计划越实际、具体、先进，这就标志着党的工作深入和有力。
    党组织在讨论计划中要坚持正确原则，从政治上进行监督，随时纠正偏向。最重要的是监督行政部门正确地对待工人的各种倡议和意见。如发现有对工人意见置之不理或是处理上拖拖拉拉现象，就要及时提出批评和纠正，这对于提高群众在讨论计划中的积极性、创造性有着直接的关系。在讨论计划中，可能有人提出盲目的、没有条件完成的冒进计划。党组织一面要向群众宣传那些实际的，合理的计划，使大家明白提高计划一定要有根据而不能单靠主观愿望，另一方面，要认真耐心地说服教育提冒进计划的人，指出他的计划没有实在的根据，帮助他提出合理的计划，对于一切不从实际出发提高计划的现象，都要及时制止。否则党在政治上就会变成尾巴主义，但在说服时要采取十分慎重的态度，不能用粗暴的方法，千万不要给群众的积极性泼冷水。
