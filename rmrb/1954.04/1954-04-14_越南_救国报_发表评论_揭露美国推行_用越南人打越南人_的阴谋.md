    Vietnam's "Save the Nation" Newspaper Publishes Commentary
    Exposing the American Conspiracy to Promote "Using Vietnamese to Fight Vietnamese"
      [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, April 13th] According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, April 11th: "Cuu Quoc" ("Save the Nation"), the official newspaper of the Vietnam National United Front Central Committee, recently published a commentary entitled: American Interventionists are Doing Their Utmost to Promote the Conspiracy of Using Vietnamese to Fight Vietnamese.

    The commentary said: When French Chief of Staff Paul Ely was recently in Washington, the American ruling clique once again demanded the power to directly control the puppet army in Vietnam. The American interventionists made it clear to the French colonialists that if the latter wanted to get more aid from the United States, they would have to let the United States train the puppet army.

    This is not the first time that American interventionists have raised this issue. At the beginning of last year, when they urged the French colonialists to expand the puppet army in Vietnam, they had already talked about sending American officers to Indochina to exchange the "experience" they had gained in establishing the Syngman Rhee puppet army. The French colonialists cleverly rejected this suggestion, and quickly established fifty-four puppet army battalions to avoid American help. But this does not in the slightest mean that the French colonialists do not recognize the need to accelerate the realization of their conspiracy to use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese, and to expand the puppet army to make up for their lack of manpower. Although the French colonialists are actually acting as servants of the United States, they have been trying as much as possible to firmly maintain their position.

    However, this time the American interventionists took advantage of the French colonialists' precarious situation to put pressure on the latter by even more unscrupulous means.

    The commentary then said: What is the result of the current dealings between the American and French imperialists on the puppet army issue? The facts show that France's attitude is not as firm as before. American General O'Daniel is about to go to Indochina to serve as the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, whose main task is to train the puppet army.

    Why are American interventionists going to such lengths to directly control the puppet army? The reason is that while they are using the French colonialists to realize their aggressive conspiracy in Indochina, they have always wanted to control the running dogs of the French colonialists, so that one day they can kick them away when they no longer need the French colonialists. In addition, the conspiracy that American interventionists have been urging the French colonialists to implement, to use Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese completely, has suffered increasing failures. The Vietnamese army and people have won successive victories, giving the enemy severe blows, thereby causing great chaos among the French invading forces. The number of puppet soldiers who deserted and defected to the Vietnamese People's Army is increasing. The movement of the people in the enemy-occupied areas against forced conscription is also strengthening day by day.

    The commentary pointed out: The American interventionists forced the French colonialists to let them train the puppet army, thus exposing their intention to seize direct command of the Indochina war of aggression, and to step up the implementation of their plan to continue this dirty war with the blood of the Vietnamese people. But whether they want to realize this conspiracy directly, or through the French colonialists, they are bound to fail, because the difficulties faced by the French colonialists are exactly the difficulties they will inevitably encounter. No matter how vicious the means of the French colonialists and the American aggressors, they cannot shake the Vietnamese people's determination to defend their independence.

### 越南“救国报”发表评论  揭露美国推行“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋

    揭露美国推行“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋
      【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越十一日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会机关报“救国报”最近一期发表了一篇评论，题目是：美国干涉者正尽力推行用越南人打越南人的阴谋。
    评论说：法国总参谋长保罗·埃利最近在华盛顿的时候，美国统治集团再次要求得到直接在越南掌握伪军的权力。美国干涉者明白地告诉法国殖民者说，假如后者要从美国得到更多的援助的话，就要让美国来训练伪军。
    美国干涉者提出这个问题已经不是第一次了。去年年初，当他们敦促法国殖民者在越南扩充伪军的时候，就已经谈到派遣美国军官到印度支那去，交流他们在建立李承晚伪军的工作中所得到的“经验”。法国殖民者巧妙地拒绝了这个建议，它赶快建立了五十四个伪军营来避免美国的帮助。但这丝毫也不意味着法国殖民者不认识到必须加速实现他们的用越南人打越南人的阴谋，并扩充伪军以弥补他们的兵员缺乏。法国殖民者虽然在实际上充当着美国的仆从的角色，但它却一直在尽可能地想牢牢地保住他们的地位。
    不过这一次美国干涉者利用了法国殖民者的危急处境，以更无耻的手段对后者施加压力。
    评论接着说：目前美法帝国主义者在伪军问题上打交道的结果如何呢？事实说明法国的态度不像以前那样坚决了。美国将军奥丹尼尔立刻就要到印度支那去担任美国军事援助顾问团团长，这个顾问团的主要工作是训练伪军。
    为什么美国干涉者费尽心机地想要直接掌握伪军呢？理由是：虽然他们在利用法国殖民者来实现他们在印度支那的侵略阴谋，然而，他们一直想控制法国殖民者的走卒，这样到有一天他们不再需要法国殖民者的时候就可以一脚踢开。此外，美国干涉者一直催促法国殖民者去实行的完全用越南人来打越南人的阴谋，已经遭到越来越大的失败。越南军民接连地得到了胜利，给了敌人严重的打击，从而引起了法国侵略军很大的混乱。伪军开小差、投向越南人民军的人数越来越多了。敌占区人民反对强迫征兵的运动也一天比一天加强了。
    评论指出：美国干涉者迫使法国殖民者让他们来训练伪军，因而暴露了他们想夺取印度支那侵略战争的直接指挥权，并加紧实行他们的用越南人民的鲜血来继续进行这场肮脏战争的计划。但是不论他们是想直接实现这个阴谋，或是通过法国殖民者来实现这个阴谋，他们都必然要遭到失败，因为法国殖民者所面临的困难也正是他们必然会遭到的困难。不论法国殖民者与美国侵略者的手段多么恶毒，他们都不能动摇越南人民保卫独立的决心。
