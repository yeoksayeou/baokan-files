Harbin City Units Actively Support Basic Construction

    Various units in Harbin are actively supporting basic construction projects. In order to supply local materials needed for basic construction projects, the Municipal Industrial Bureau plans to build one brick factory, one cement tile factory, and one oxygen factory this year; construction is planned to be completed in the first half of the year and production will begin in the second half. The Municipal Construction Bureau established a survey team in January to understand the internal and external equipment capabilities of key construction units, and formulated plans for the load of the main water supply line and the opening of transportation lines. In addition to improving existing construction site service departments, commercial departments have also organized personnel to go deep into construction sites to understand workers' needs and formulate supply plans. The Municipal Cooperative General Society Federation plans to establish construction site service departments in construction units with a construction period of more than five months, and establish vegetable, fish, and meat supply stations in areas with more construction sites to supply non-staple foods to the construction sites. The Municipal Labor Bureau has formulated a basic construction labor force allocation and supply plan, a safety measures plan, and a preparation work plan for implementing this year's labor quotas. The Municipal Hardware and Machinery Company and the Transportation and Electrical Equipment Company, in addition to actively investigating the needs of basic construction departments and organizing procurement, also organized private factories in the city to process various building materials. In order to strengthen on-site sanitation work, the Municipal Health Bureau sent 36 doctors and nurses to various basic construction units in the first quarter, and jointly formed a construction site health and safety office with the Municipal Labor Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Construction Trade Union to be responsible for inspecting on-site safety and health work. In late March, the Municipal Health Bureau conducted research with six major hospitals including Songjiang Provincial Hospital and Harbin Municipal Hospital, and determined to prepare fixed beds and outpatient quotas to serve construction workers.
