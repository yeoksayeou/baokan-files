    Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory is rushing to produce wheat harvesters for farmers. The first wheat harvester was assembled successfully on March 18th. That afternoon, during testing, farmers from the suburbs of Xi'an, including Wu Xinmin, came to the factory to exchange waterwheel parts. They witnessed the harvester's blades, as sharp as barber's clippers, with a cutting width of four feet eight inches. They praised, "This is much faster than harvesting wheat with sickles!" This type of wheat harvester, when pulled by horses, can harvest eighty mu of wheat per day.
    During the trial production of the wheat harvester, the workers considered the farmers' needs in every aspect. For example, the original blade quenching technology was not good, the blades were not sharp, and the cutting edges were prone to chipping. Fitter Guo Jiasheng was very anxious, saying, "I must not let this affect the farmers' wheat harvesting!" Later, Guo Jiasheng and technicians Sun Chenghe and Pan Yanhua worked hard together and finally broke through this key production bottleneck, enabling the entire trial production to be completed on schedule.
    Now, the factory has shifted from trial production of wheat harvesters to formal production. A large number of wheat harvesters will be produced and supplied to farmers in the Northwest before the wheat harvest.

    西北农业机械制造厂为农民赶制割麦机
    西北农业机械制造厂工人正为农民赶制割麦机，第一部割麦机已经在三月十八日装配成功。当天下午试验时，正碰上西安郊区农民吴新民等来厂里换水车零件，他们亲眼见到割麦机的刀子像理发用的推子一样锋利，刀口足有四尺八寸宽，就赞美说：“这可比用镰割麦快多啦！”这种割麦机用马拉上每天可以割八十亩麦。
    在试制割麦机期间，工人们处处为农民打算。如原来刀片淬火技术不好，刀片既不锐利，刀刃又容易崩口，钳工郭家生非常焦急，他说：“决不能在我手里影响农民割麦！”后来，郭家生和技术员孙成河、潘延华共同刻苦研究，终于突破了这一生产关键，使整个试制工作按期完成。
    现在，该厂已由试制割麦机转入正式生产阶段，麦收前将生产一大批割麦机供应西北农民。
