    Under the instigation and planning of the US authorities,
    Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly incorporated志愿军 prisoners of war into the bandit army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] Under the instigation of the US authorities, the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan forcibly incorporated Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who had been abducted from Korea to Taiwan by the US, into the Kuomintang remnant bandit troops directly supported and trained by the US on the 11th. According to US news agencies, with the exception of a portion of the elderly, weak, wounded, and sick, approximately 13,000 Chinese prisoners of war were forced to don the uniforms of the Kuomintang bandit army on the 11th and were sent to various units of the bandit army. This fact irrefutably proves that the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is entirely a trick to forcibly detain prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder for the Kuomintang bandit gang. The US authorities bear inescapable and full responsibility for this crime.

    在美国当局指使和策划下
    蒋匪把志愿军战俘强编入匪军
    【新华社十二日讯】在美国当局的指使下，台湾国民党匪帮已在十一日把美方从朝鲜劫往台湾的中国人民志愿军被俘人员强制编入美国直接支持和训练下的国民党残匪部队。据美国通讯社报道，除一部分老弱伤病人员以外，一万三千名左右中国战俘已于十一日被迫换上国民党匪军的军服，并被送交匪军的各个部队。这一事实无可辩驳地证明了美方的所谓“自愿遣返”完全是一个强迫扣留战俘来充当国民党匪帮的炮灰的骗局。美国当局对于这一罪行负有无可逃避的完全责任。
