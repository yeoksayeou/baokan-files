    Li Bingzhong's Letter to Wang Chonglun
    Dear Comrade Wang Chonglun:
    When I saw your advanced deeds in the newspaper, how excited I was! I thought, you are a young person, and I am also a young person; you are a planer, and I am also a planer; you are a member of the Communist Youth League, and I am also a member of the Communist Youth League. How could you cherish time so much, completing four years' worth of tasks in one year, while I carelessly let time slip away in the past? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. Therefore, I made up my mind to learn from you and become a person who runs ahead of time.
    In late December last year, with only a few days before the New Year, our section chief gave me a batch of motor frames to process, saying it would be best to complete them before the New Year. However, based on the production situation at the time, it would take twenty-seven days to complete. But I immediately thought that this was the last month of the first year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan. If I failed to complete the task alone, it would affect the team and the workshop; if the workshop failed to complete the task, it would affect the whole factory; and if the whole factory failed to complete the task, it would affect our country's economic construction. I also thought of your spirit of creation and innovation, so my enthusiasm and determination greatly increased. During the work, I modified the tools and fixtures several times, and used the Soviet multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method. With the help and support of my comrades, I finally completed the task in less than five days.
    After studying the General Line, I became more clearly aware of the great responsibility of the working class, and you have set a good example for us. Thinking of this, my labor enthusiasm is even higher. In January of this year, I completed forty-eight working days' worth of tasks in fifteen working days; in February, I completed fifty-two days' worth of tasks in seventeen days; and in March, I completed fifty-two and a half working days' worth of tasks in fifteen days.
    I always feel that I am far behind and still far from the requirements of the motherland. I sincerely thank you and humbly learn from you; I learned from you in the past, I am learning from you now, and I will continue to learn from you in the future. For the common ideal—building a beautiful socialism—may we advance together.
    Respected Comrade: I would very much like to know your recent new achievements and hope that you can often give me friendly help.
    A firm handshake,
            Li Bingzhong, Worker of Chongqing Air Compressor Factory
                          March 22

    李秉中给王崇伦的信
    亲爱的王崇伦同志：
    当我在报纸上看到你的先进事迹时，我的心是多么激动，我想你是青年我也是青年，你是刨工我也是刨工，你是团员我也是团员，你怎么那样爱惜时间，一年就完成了四年的任务，而我过去却把时间轻易放过去了呢？越想越感觉得很惭愧。于是，我就下定决心向你学习，做一个跑在时间前面的人。
    去年十二月下旬，眼看只有几天就要过年了，我们段长交给我一批马达架生活，说是最好在年前完成，可是根据当时的生产情况，需要二十七天才能完成。但我马上想到，这是祖国第一个五年计划的第一个年头的最后一个月，要是我一个人完不成任务就会影响小组和车间，车间完不成任务就会影响全厂，全厂完不成任务就会影响我国的经济建设；又联想到你的创造革新精神，于是劲头和决心大大增加了。在工作中我几次改工具、夹具，运用苏联的多刀多刃切削法，在同志们的帮助和支持下，终于在五天以内完成了任务。
    学了总路线，我更明确地认识到工人阶级的责任的重大，而你又为我们树立了好榜样，想到这些，我的劳动热情更高了。今年一月份我以十五个工作日完成了四十八个工作日的任务；二月份以十七天完成了五十二天的任务；三月份又以十五天完成了五十二个半工作日任务。
    我总是感觉自己差得很，离祖国的要求还很远。我衷心地感谢你，虚心地向你学习；以前向你学习，现在向你学习，今后仍然要向你学习。为了共同的理想——建设美好的社会主义，愿我们共同前进。
    敬爱的同志：我很想知道你最近的新成就，盼望你经常能给我友谊的帮助。
    紧紧地握手
            重庆空气压缩机厂工人  李秉中
                          三月二十二日
