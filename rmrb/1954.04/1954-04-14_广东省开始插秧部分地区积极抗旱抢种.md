Guangdong Province has entered the busy season of spring plowing. Except for the northern Guangdong area, other areas have begun rice transplanting, generally seven to twenty days earlier than last year. Hainan Island, where the agricultural season starts earlier, has basically completed spring plowing and entered the stage of mid-season management and weeding. In Wanning, Lehui, Qiongzhong and other counties, early rice is already flowering and heading, growing well, and a good harvest is expected. Haikang, Xuwen, and Suixi counties on the Leizhou Peninsula have also basically completed transplanting. Other spring crops, such as peanuts, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, taro, and soybeans, were also sown before Qingming Festival.

However, Guangdong has had little rainfall since last winter and this spring, and many areas are currently showing signs of drought. More than fifty counties across the province are threatened by varying degrees of drought. The CPC committees in eastern Guangdong, northern Guangdong, and central Guangdong successively issued emergency instructions in late March, calling on cadres at all levels to pay close attention to the drought situation, go deep into the masses, overcome passive waiting, guide the masses to fight drought and protect seedlings, divert water for transplanting, and strive for a bumper harvest of early rice.

Currently, in many drought-affected areas, under the in-depth and specific leadership of cadres at all levels and driven by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, a mass movement to fight drought, protect seedlings, and transplant rice is being launched. For example, in the first village of Fengxi Township, first district of Chao'an County, all the farmers in the village were organized and dug twenty-four ponds, overcoming the water shortage difficulties for 460 mu of land. Farmers in Wuli Village, first district of Puning County, organized collective water lifting, dispatching thirty waterwheels and 250 people every day, taking turns to lift water. After eight days of hard work, they finally successfully transplanted early rice seedlings on the original 550 mu of drought-stricken land. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, farmers in Suixi County invested in drought resistance and rushed to plant crops such as rice, peanuts, soybeans, and sweet potatoes, covering more than 114,000 mu. In the northern Guangdong area, where the agricultural season is later, sowing is currently underway, and farmers in some drought-affected areas are also actively engaged in drought resistance to protect seedlings and prepare for transplanting.

    广东省开始插秧部分地区积极抗旱抢种
    广东省的春耕农忙季节已经到来，除了粤北区外，其它各地已经开始插秧，普遍比去年提早了七天到二十天。农事季节较早的海南岛已基本结束春耕，进入中耕除草阶段；万宁、乐会、琼中等县，早稻则已扬花抽穗，生长良好，丰收可望。雷州半岛上的海康、徐闻、遂溪等县也已基本完成插秧工作。其它春季作物，如花生、甘蔗、番薯、芋头、大豆等，在清明前也都下种。
    但是，广东去冬今春雨量稀少，目前许多地区已呈现旱象，全省有五十多个县都受程度不同的旱灾威胁。粤东、粤北、粤中区中共党委先后在三月下旬发出紧急指示，号召各级干部密切注意旱情，深入群众，克服消极等待思想，引导群众抗旱保苗，引水插秧，争取早稻丰收。
    现在许多受旱的地区，在各级干部深入具体领导与农业生产合作社、互助组带动下，掀起群众性的抗旱保秧插秧运动。如潮安县一区枫溪乡第一村，全村农民都组织起来，挖了二十四个池塘，克服了四百六十亩田的缺水困难。普宁县一区乌黎村农民组织集体车水，每天出动三十架水车和二百五十人，轮流车水，经过八天辛勤劳动，终于使原来受旱的五百五十亩田，顺利地插下了早稻秧苗。遂溪县在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，整乡整村的农民投入抗旱斗争，抢种下水稻、花生、大豆、番薯等作物达一十一万四千多亩。在农事季节较迟的粤北区，目前正进行播种，部分受旱地区的农民，也正积极进行抗旱保苗和准备插秧工作。
