Model Army Family Member Liu Laidi, After Being Elected as a People's Representative, Actively Leads Farmers to Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations

Model revolutionary army family member Liu Laidi, a member of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, and known as "Chinese Mama" by the Korean People's Army, after being elected as a people's representative of Wuyang Township, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, actively led farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and carry out spring plowing production.

When she returned from Korea in January this year, she was very happy to learn that the people of the township had elected her as a people's representative, and expressed that she would definitely lead everyone to do a good job in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production. In late February, Liu Laidi attended the Fourth People's Congress of Wuyang Township. The Congress, in accordance with the spirit of the general line of the state during the transition period, discussed and formulated a plan for this year to increase the number of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations from 30 percent last year to 50 percent, and to increase total grain production by 10 percent throughout the year. At the meeting, Liu Laidi put forward many opinions on how to implement the general line in the township this year. After the meeting, she actively implemented the resolutions of the Township People's Congress and first started checking the production preparations of the mutual aid group she led and the entire village. During the inspection, she found that some leaky reservoirs and canals in the mutual aid group and the village had not been repaired due to the heavy rainfall last winter, and not much fertilizer had been accumulated. Liu Laidi then called a meeting of the farmers in the mutual aid group to mobilize everyone to repair the water conservancy facilities in the village before spring plowing and to carry out a surprise fertilizer accumulation campaign. Under the leadership of her and her mutual aid group, the farmers in the entire village repaired a reservoir and four canals, and accumulated more than 6,000 dan of fertilizer in just over ten days. While repairing reservoirs and canals and increasing fertilizer accumulation, Liu Laidi also publicized and explained the general line to individual farmers in the village, and mobilized them to organize and take the socialist road. After the publicity, forty-two farmers in the village organized six seasonal mutual aid groups. In order to help these newly established mutual aid groups to do a good job in production, Liu Laidi also used her own mutual aid group as the center, and established a mutual aid and cooperation network with seven mutual aid groups in the village and twenty other mutual aid groups in the township, helping each newly established mutual aid group to formulate this year's grain production increase plan, and holding a joint group leader meeting before the start of each production season to study the work of the mutual aid groups and promote production experience. Before spring plowing and sowing, Liu Laidi had already led and held two such meetings, studying how to complete this year's grain production increase plan and the issue of work evaluation and scoring within the mutual aid groups, and promoted the advanced experience of mud and water seed selection and making new-style seedling fields. These methods were universally welcomed by farmers.

In order to further lead the farmers of the entire township to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and to set an example for them, Liu Laidi has recently rectified and expanded the mutual aid group she leads, increasing it from the original seven households to sixteen households. She is now actively preparing to create conditions for transitioning to an agricultural production cooperative after the autumn harvest. (Xinhua News Agency)

    模范军属刘来娣当选为人民代表后
    积极带领农民参加互助合作组织
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团团员、被朝鲜人民军唤作“中国妈妈”的模范革命军人家属刘来娣当选为江西省瑞金县武阳乡人民代表后，积极带领农民参加互助合作组织和进行春耕生产。
    今年一月当她由朝鲜回来时，知道全乡人民选举她为人民代表，非常高兴，表示一定带领大家搞好互助合作运动和农业生产。二月下旬，刘来娣出席了武阳乡召开的第四次人民代表大会，大会根据国家过渡时期总路线的精神，讨论和制订了今年全乡由去年参加互助合作组织占百分之三十的农户增加到百分之五十和全年粮食增产百分之十的计划。会上，刘来娣提出了很多关于今年在本乡如何贯彻总路线的意见。会后，她便积极执行乡人民代表大会的决议，首先着手检查了她领导的互助组和全村的生产准备情况。在检查时，她发现互助组和村里的农民因去冬雨水多，有些漏水的水库、水圳都没有补修好，肥料也积存得不多。刘来娣就召集互助组内的农民开会，动员大家在春耕前把村里的水利修好，并开展突击性的增积肥料运动。全村农民在她和她的互助组带领下，十多天的时间内就补修好一个水库和四条水圳，积好六千多担肥料。在补修水库、水圳和增积肥料的同时，刘来娣又向村里单干农民宣传和讲解总路线，动员他们组织起来走社会主义的道路。经过宣传后，村里有四十二户农民分别组织了六个季节性互助组。刘来娣为了帮助这些新成立的互助组搞好生产，还以自己的互助组为中心，和村里的七个互助组以及全乡另外的二十个互助组建立了互助合作网，帮助各个新成立的互助组订出了今年的粮食增产计划，并在每个生产季节开始前召开联组组长会议，研究互助组的工作和推广生产经验。在春耕播种前，刘来娣已领导召开了两次这样的会议，研究了如何完成今年的粮食增产计划和互助组内的评工记分问题，并推广了泥水选种和做新式秧田的先进经验。这些办法受到农民的普遍欢迎。
    刘来娣为了进一步带领全乡农民走互助合作的道路，并给他们做出榜样，最近她已把她领导的互助组进行了整顿和扩大，由原来七户增加到十六户。现正在积极准备为秋后转为农业生产合作社创造条件。　（新华社）
