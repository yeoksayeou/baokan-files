Salt Worker Hu Langming from the private Qunli Salt Factory in Wutongqiao City, Sichuan Province, recently succeeded in experimenting with embedded-pot salt production. Since March 10th, the Qunli Salt Factory has used this method to boil eight pots of salt in a little over a month, proving that it has a significant impact on safety and production. According to preliminary calculations, the labor productivity of embedded-pot salt production can be increased by more than 35%. Judging only from extending the lifespan of the salt pots and reducing coal consumption, costs can be reduced by 9.48%. It can also solve the problem of insufficient stove room equipment and the lack of salt-boiling technicians.

Embedded-pot salt production has been warmly welcomed by the salt workers in Wutongqiao City. In the past, every time a pot of salt was boiled, it required seven or eight workers to lift the salt pot, weighing 1,500 to 2,000 jin and with a very high temperature, off the salt stove, apply glaze, and then boil again. If one was careless and the pot fell, workers would be crushed to death. With embedded-pot salt production, after the salt is boiled, you only need to disassemble the pot to apply the glaze, and then embed it again for use, thus ensuring the safety of the workers.

    试验镶锅烧盐成功
    四川省五通桥市私营群力盐厂盐工胡朗铭，最近试验镶锅烧盐成功，从三月十日起，群力盐厂在一个来月的时间里，用这个办法烧了八锅盐，证明对安全和生产都有重大作用。据初步计算，用镶锅烧盐，劳动生产率可提高百分之三十五以上，仅从延长盐锅寿命和降低煤耗来计算，就可降低成本百分之九点四八。并可解决灶房设备不足及烧盐技工缺乏的问题。
    镶锅烧盐受到五通桥市盐工们的热烈欢迎。过去每烧一锅盐，就需要七八个工人把重达一千五百至两千市斤、温度很高的盐锅从盐灶上抬开，上好釉泥，然后才能再烧；一不小心锅倒下来，就要压死工人。镶锅烧盐，在盐烧好后，只须把锅拆开就能上釉，然后再镶起使用，这样工人的安全就有了保障。
