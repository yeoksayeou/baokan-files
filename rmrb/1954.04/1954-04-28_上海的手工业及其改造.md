    Shanghai's Handicraft Industry and Its Transformation
    By our reporter Ai Fang
    Shanghai is a large manufacturing city. It not only has various factories with advanced equipment and large-scale production and a large number of industrial workers, but also a large number of handicraftsmen and handicraft workers.
    Before liberation, Shanghai's handicraft industry, like its machine industry, suffered from extremely low purchasing power, continuous inflation, and the massive dumping of goods by imperialists. Its fate was very miserable (in addition, it also suffered from the blows of commercial capital, usurers, etc.); except for a very few handicraft industries producing high-end consumer goods that developed abnormally, the vast majority of handicraft industries declined, fell into disrepair, and went bankrupt. It could not withstand such a series of blows. Even if it repeatedly lowered its living standards, even to the point where it could not maintain itself, it still could not change its declining state. After liberation, it began to have vitality (people's purchasing power increased day by day, prices stabilized, and the dumping of goods by imperialists disappeared). Under the leadership of the local government and the state-owned economy, it has been developing step by step in recent years. Comparing the output value of six major handicraft industries (knitting, ribbon weaving, mirror making, Chinese-style wooden furniture, cardboard boxes, and underwear) in Shanghai's Yimiao District in February 1952 with February 1953: if the output value of each industry in February 1952 is taken as 100, the figures for February 1953 are 253.13 for knitting, 138 for ribbon weaving, 1002.2 for underwear, 192.6 for Chinese-style wooden furniture, 105.44 for mirror making, and 351.5 for cardboard boxes. From the perspective of the entire city, the development of handicraft industry is also obvious.
    It is said that Shanghai has a large number of handicraft industries and has developed in recent years. How many are there currently? What is the output value? It is still impossible to find an accurate answer to this. According to past surveys and statistics from Shanghai's relevant financial and economic departments, it is estimated that there are currently more than 40,000 handicraft households in Shanghai with three or fewer people (including unlicensed businesses and family handicrafts), and approximately 100,000 people engaged in handicraft industries (handicraft owners, workers, and apprentices with three or fewer people) (the number of workers in handicraft factories is much higher than this number). In the 21 districts of the city, Yimiao District, which has more handicraft industries, has the following situation: according to surveys conducted before and after 1952, there were 4,217 large, medium, and small handicraft businesses, of which 2,529 were with three or fewer people (owners participating in the main labor, employing two or fewer workers and apprentices) (recent surveys show about 3,000 households). The total number of people in large and medium-sized handicraft industries in the district is 10,930, plus the number of 2,529 households, estimated to be over 15,000 people. Here, what a handicraftsman sees is that in a day's labor, he only makes one or two pairs of leather shoes, less than a dozen or more socks, or a few or dozens of parts for steel pens... Some repair a few pairs of shoes a day, some repair a few watches... Some people only make a few kitchen knives or scissors, or a few parts for a machine in a day... Compared with machine industry, this is naturally dwarfed; however, from the perspective of hundreds of thousands or even more handicraftsmen and handicraft workers, what they produce in a year will be trillions, including thousands of types of large quantities of goods made by more than one hundred industries, and various kinds of repair work. Taking Shanghai—a city with a relatively concentrated industry—as an example, although the handicraft industry is not large compared with other economies, it is even more important in the current situation where China's machine industry is still very lacking and the vast majority of people need a large number of consumer goods and means of production. Moreover, there are also many handicraft industries that cannot be replaced by machine industry even after the machine industry is developed in the future.
    Shanghai's and the nation's handicraft industry is an indispensable part of the current national economy. It can make up for the shortcomings of machine industry production, meet the diverse requirements of people's lives and the needs of national construction. This is one aspect of the reason why we cannot ignore it. Since the handicraft industry is still built on the basis of a decentralized individual private economy, Shanghai's handicraft industry, like other handicraft industries, has production blindness, technical conservatism (keeping secrets, not exchanging experiences, and even the loss of skills with the death of the craftsman), and capital shortage, which are all backwardness in production and management. These fundamental shortcomings seriously hinder the development of the potential of the handicraft industry, making it impossible to better utilize it for the country and the people, and even causing some chaos in the market. Under this circumstance, the improvement of the lives of handicraft workers is also greatly restricted. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of the handicraft industry. This is another aspect of the reason why we cannot ignore it.
    The transformation of the handicraft industry is to be carried out through the road of cooperation.
    Shanghai's handicraft industry has many characteristics, which cannot but affect its transformation. First of all, for the vast majority of Shanghai's handicraft industry, it does not directly serve agricultural production, but serves the daily lives of the vast urban and rural population and national construction. Therefore, Shanghai's handicraft industry is highly dependent on commerce and machine industry. Here, around many shops and machine industries, there are countless handicraftsmen who produce, process, and have supply and sales relationships with them. That is to say, in addition to establishing supply and sales and production links with state-owned industry, commerce, and cooperatives, many handicraftsmen are also dependent on commercial capital and industrial capital and are controlled by them. This is the reason why handicraftsmen cannot finally escape from their predicament. There are also many handicraftsmen who are interdependent because they cannot independently manufacture complete goods, such as the relationship between knitting and dyeing, and the plastic, leather sacs, springs, nibs, and assembly of handmade steel pens (mostly operated separately). Second, there are many industries, complex products, and wide sales channels. One of the characteristics of general handicraft industry is that the product legs are short and cannot be sold far. However, many Shanghai handicrafts can be sold throughout the country, such as leather shoes that can be sold to the Northeast, small mirrors that can be sold to Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, and scissors, embroidery, and children's hats that can be sold to some areas of North China, Northwest China, and Central and South China. The products of other industries are also supplied to many parts of the country. Third, due to blind production and the influence of seasonal production, there are many changes in career changes and shutdowns and openings, with large fluctuations. In recent years, the general trend of Shanghai's handicraft industry has been development. However, it is not to say that this development is a straight upward line and a balanced development of various industries; on the contrary, the fluctuations and changes in development are very large. For example, some handicraftsmen have changed careers two or three times, six or seven times, or even more times in recent years with changes in the market. According to a survey by the Shanghai Yimiao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, there were only a few households in the Shanghai wind buckle industry before liberation. In the spring of 1951, it developed to more than 100 households, but by the end of the same year, it had dropped by two-thirds, and by the end of 1952, there were only about 30 households. Another example is the knitting industry taxpayers managed by the fourth branch of the Yimiao District Tax Bureau, which has undergone the following changes since July last year: there were 64 households in July last year, which rose to 106 households in November last year, fell to 91 households in January this year, and fell to 85 households in February (seasonal influences are great).
    The countless facts in the above characteristics have educated the handicraft workers that it is impossible to take the road of capitalism, and strengthened everyone's demand to organize and take the road of cooperation and develop in the direction of socialism. Also, because Shanghai has many machine industries and machine manufacturing industries, and has electrical equipment, the conditions for developing to semi-mechanization and mechanization after being organized are good and easier. However, due to the above characteristics—large quantity, large changes, and complex situations—it also makes some transformation work more arduous and difficult.
    Under such circumstances, the local government and cooperatives have done a lot of work in the transformation of the handicraft industry in recent years, and the handicraft production cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as production cooperatives) have greatly developed. By the end of last year, there were 52 cooperatives in 11 industries such as cotton weaving, knitting, and hardware, with more than 5,700 people organized under the direct leadership of the cooperatives—including a small number of employees (not including the seven or eight new cooperatives and about 300 people organized by the Labor Bureau and transferred to the Shanghai Production Cooperative Preparatory Committee for leadership in the first quarter of this year), of which 20 cooperatives have progressed from manual production to varying degrees of using machine production. The cooperatives have accumulated nearly 28 billion yuan in public accumulation funds, and the total annual output value last year has reached more than 280 billion yuan. In addition, the number of people organized by mass production enterprises organized by local government civil affairs, labor departments, and some people's organizations to relieve unemployment and solve the problems of mass life, as well as self-organized production cooperatives that meet the conditions, greatly exceeds the above numbers, and the output value also greatly exceeds the above output value numbers. After thousands of handicraft workers and handicraft workers have been organized, they have changed their past production and living conditions.
  Let's take a look at the changes that have taken place after the
                Shanghai Iron Bed Production Cooperative was organized:
    This is a production cooperative initiated and organized by 30 unemployed workers three years ago. At that time, they had no funds, no tools, and no factories, and they relied entirely on borrowing from the east and borrowing from the west to start production. Everyone overcame countless difficulties and has now become a cooperative factory with more than 200 people (including a small number of employees). In recent years, they have accumulated more than 3 billion yuan in public accumulation funds, purchased more than 12 acres of factory land, more than 100 houses, and other production equipment. More importantly, they have cultivated a group of management cadres and created experience, which makes everyone's production and life built on a reliable foundation.
    Exploitation has been eliminated here, and everyone has established mutual assistance and cooperation in production relations. Everyone knows the bitterness of three years of apprenticeship and one year of Bu Shi in the past
  (Bu Shi means to repay the master for one year of study, because apprentices did not have wages during their apprenticeship), so everyone tries hard to teach each other, learn from each other, and study technology. Here, they can quickly master the operation technology more proficiently, and no longer need several years. For example, dozens of people were transferred from brother cooperatives last year. They used to make leather shoes, but they caught up in two or three months in the new position. Production technology and equipment are constantly improving (now it is semi-mechanical production), and labor organization is also constantly improving. As a result, production efficiency is constantly improving—in 1950, the average total output value per person in the cooperative was more than 40 million yuan, the average annual output value per person in 1951 and 1952 was more than 70 million yuan, and the average annual output value per person last year has increased to more than 100 million yuan. The quality of products has also gradually improved, and costs have gradually decreased. They have repeatedly reduced the selling price of products, which is a proof that they cannot meet the orders from various places.
    With the improvement of production, the lives of cooperative members are also constantly improving. When the cooperative started, it was so difficult that it was impossible to improve living standards. The highest monthly salary of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan was the highest. Now, the lowest salary has exceeded this amount. Last year, the various welfare expenses used on each cooperative member in the cooperative were only 20,000 yuan (such as medical expenses, etc. were only subsidies). Now the cooperative is fully responsible for the medical expenses of the cooperative members, and 30% of the salary is paid for sick leave, and 70% is paid for work-related injury leave. The cooperative also runs a spare-time school, and illiteracy has now been basically eliminated.
    Of course, this is beneficial to the country and the people. In last year alone, they produced more than 22,000 high-quality iron beds and hundreds of medical devices, which were supplied to various places, and played a great role in stabilizing the market price of the above products.
    After many handicraftsmen ran into obstacles to developing capitalism spontaneously in the past, they had the desire to organize, but they did not know how to organize, and what the specific situation of the organization was. After seeing the above moving situation, the questions were solved. The more important role of these production cooperatives that have been organized is here.
    But this is not to say that everything is without problems. In the existing production cooperatives, capitalist ideas and styles still exist seriously, which is manifested in the fact that many wages are too high, and some cooperatives are sometimes unwilling to accept the state's commissioned processing orders, etc. The habit of freedom and laxity still exists quite seriously among the members of the cooperative. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological work and collectivism education in the production cooperatives, and rectify the business and management style. These have already begun to be implemented in various cooperatives. Some cooperatives adjusted the production quota in the first quarter of this year to make wages more reasonable. In the future, the work in this area needs to be further strengthened in various cooperatives.
    More importantly, there is the problem of leadership, management, and transformation of the vast number of handicraft households that have not yet been organized. There are still some shortcomings in this regard. For example, the local industrial and commercial management departments have improper practices in handling the applications for business registration and licenses by some handicraft households (these tasks in the local area were handled by the industrial and commercial sections of the district government in the past). There are many handicraft households here whose applications for business registration have not been approved, and whose production and sales have no major problems, and can exist for a long time (there are about 3,000 handicraft households in Yimiao District, and about 900 households are not registered, a part of which have not applied to the District Industrial and Commercial Section for business registration, but there are also many who have applied but have not been approved). The reasons for not approving are often: blind development, overproduction, not needed for national economy and people's livelihood, etc. Since it is still an individual privately owned economy that has not been transformed, of course it is developing blindly, so it is necessary to actively transform it. Is it already overproduced and not needed for the national economy and people's livelihood? Individual or temporary industries have this situation; but generally speaking, it is not the case, but it is needed by the people, and there is no major problem with production and sales. The fact that many handicraft households have not been registered but have opened and can exist for a long time is proof. Furthermore, the organization of developing production cooperatives is also behind the actual needs. Here, there are many handicraftsmen who have successively requested the leadership of the production cooperative organization to organize them, some have proposed it for a long time, and are basically qualified, but have not been organized in a timely and led manner. Some have already spontaneously organized (that is, spontaneous cooperatives, such as the Dazhong Brush Cooperative in Guandi Temple in Yimiao District, which is an example. It was organized in 1952 by more than 70 brush-making workers and independent laborers, with a share capital of 200,000 yuan per person. The business did not start very well. Now it can produce 20,000 to 30,000 brushes per month, and there is no major problem with production and sales. The average monthly salary per person is about 400,000 yuan. In addition to paying taxes and other expenses, there is also a surplus. Although it still has many shortcomings and needs to be rectified and improved, it is an enterprise of the nature of a production cooperative. They are willing to abide by the regulations of the local production cooperative preparatory committee and apply for leadership, but it has not been resolved for a long time).
    The shortcomings in these tasks are obviously mainly due to insufficient understanding of the significance of the handicraft industry in the current national economy and the importance of the transformation of the handicraft industry. We actively lead, manage, and transform the handicraft industry, which cannot be understood as taking care of it and promoting its passive dependence thinking (many handicraftsmen have shown this thinking in various aspects, which does exist at present). On the contrary, it can better persuade and eliminate its passive dependence thinking; nor can the active leadership, management, and transformation of the handicraft industry be interpreted as blind advancement, but to better and correctly implement the policy of actively and steadily transforming the handicraft industry.

    上海的手工业及其改造
    本报记者　艾方
    上海是个生产的大城市。它不仅有很多具有进步设备、进行大生产的各种各样的工厂和大量的产业工人，同时还有数量众多的手工业者和手工业工人。
    解放以前，上海的手工业和机器工业同样处于人民购买力极度低下、通货不断膨胀、帝国主义的商品大量倾销等重重打击之下，它的命运是很悲惨的（此外它还遭受商业资本、高利贷者等等的打击）；除极少数生产高级消费品的手工业畸形发展之外，绝大多数手工业走向萧条、没落、倒闭。它抗不住这样一连串的打击，即使一再降低自己的生活水平，甚至到了不能维持的地步，仍不能改变没落的状况。解放以后，才有了生机（人民购买力日见提高、物价稳定、帝国主义的商品倾销绝迹）。在当地政府和国营经济领导之下，几年以来它一步一步向前发展了。就以上海邑庙区六个主要手工行业（针织、织带、制镜、中式木器、纸盒、内衣）一九五二年二月同一九五三年二月的产值来比较：如以一九五二年二月各业产值为一○○，一九五三年针织为二五三点一三，织带为一三八，内衣为一○○二点二，中式木器为一九二点六，制镜业为一○五点四四，纸盒业为三五一点五。从全市来看，手工业发展的情况也是明显的。
    说上海的手工业数量多，几年以来并且有了发展，当前究竟有多少？产值有多大？这还找不出确切的回答。根据上海有关财经部门过去的调查统计，估计当前上海三人以下的手工业户（无照开业户和家庭手工业包括在内）在四万户以上，手工业从业人员（三人以下的手工业主、工人和学徒）约十万人（加上手工业工厂的工人数字当大大超过这个数字）。全市二十一个区中手工业较多的邑庙区的情况是：据一九五二年年前年后的调查，大、中、小型手工业有四二一七户，其中三人以下的（业主参加主要劳动，雇佣工人、学徒在二人以下的）有二五二九户（最近调查有三千户左右）。全区大、中型手工业一○九三○人，加上二五二九户的人数，估计在一万五千人以上。在这里，从一个手工业者所看到的，一天的劳动，只做了一双到两双皮鞋，不到一打或者一打以上的袜子，或者几只、几十只钢笔上的零件，……有的一天修理了几双鞋，有的修了几只表，……有的几个人一天才打了几把菜刀、剪刀，或者一部机器上的几个零件……。这和机器工业相比，自然是相形见绌；但是，从十万以至更多的手工业者、手工业工人来看，一年所生产的，将是几万亿，包括一百多个行业所制做的成千上万种大量物品，和各种各样的修理工作。拿上海——这个工业比较集中的城市来说，手工业和其他经济来比虽然不大，但在当前我国机器工业还很缺乏，广大人民需要大量消费品和生产资料的情况下，手工业就显得更重要了。并且也有不少的手工业，将来机器工业发达以后，也不能由机器工业所代替。
    上海以及全国的手工业同为目前国民经济中所不可缺少的部分，它可以补机器工业生产的不足，满足人民生活上多种多样的要求，和国家建设上的需要，这是我们不能忽视它的一方面的原因。由于手工业还是建筑在分散的个体私有经济基础之上的，上海的手工业同其他各地的手工业同样具有生产上的盲目性、技术上的保守（留一手、互不交流经验、甚至人亡艺绝）和资金短绌等生产上和经营管理上的落后性，这些根本缺点，严重地阻碍着手工业潜力的发挥，不能更好地为国家和人民所利用，甚至还会造成市场上一些混乱。在这种情况之下，手工业者的生活改善也受到很大的限制。因此，必须对手工业者实行社会主义改造。这是我们不能忽视它的另一方面的原因。
    对手工业的改造，是要通过合作化的道路的。
    上海的手工业有很多特点，这些特点不能不影响到对它的改造。首先，上海的手工业就绝大多数来说，不是直接为农业生产服务的，而是为广大城乡人民日常生活和国家建设服务的。因此，上海的手工业对商业和机器工业的依附性大。在这里，很多商店和机器工业的周围，有无数手工业者为它生产、加工，和它发生供销关系。这就是说，除了和国营工业、商业以及合作社建立了供销、生产上的联系以外，很多手工业还依附于商业资本、工业资本，而为它所控制。这是手工业者不能最后脱离困境的原因。也有很多手工业者，因为不能独立制造完整的商品，而互相依存，如针织和染织，手工制钢笔的塑胶、皮囊、弹簧、笔尖、装配（多是分别经营的）等的关系。第二，行业多，产品复杂，产品销路也广。一般手工业的特点之一，是产品腿短，不能远销。但上海有不少手工业品，可以销行全国，如皮鞋可以销东北，小镜子可销到内蒙、新疆、西藏，剪刀、绣花、童帽销行华北、西北、中南的若干地区。其他行业的产品，供应全国各地的也很多。第三，由于盲目生产，和生产季节性的影响，造成转业和停业、开业的变化多，起伏波动大。几年以来，上海的手工业总的趋势是发展的。但不是说这种发展是直线上升，各业平衡的；相反，发展中的波动、变化很大。例如有些手工业者随着市场上的变化，几年以来转业两、三次，六、七次，以至更多的次数。据中共上海邑庙区委会调查，上海的风纪扣业解放前仅有几户，一九五一年春发展到一百多户，同年年底降了三分之二，一九五二年底只有三十户左右了。又如邑庙区税务分局第四分所所管针织业纳税户，自去年七月以来就有如下变化：去年七月是六十四户，去年十一月上升至一百零六户，今年一月降为九十一户，二月降为八十五户（季节影响大）。
    上述特点中的无数事实教育了手工业者，走资本主义的道路是走不通的，加强了大家组织起来走合作化的道路、向社会主义方向发展的要求。也因为上海的机器工业多、机器制造业多，有电力设备，所以组织起来以后向半机械化、机械化发展的条件好，较容易。但也由于上述特点——数量多、变化大、情况复杂，因此也使若干改造工作更加繁重、艰巨。
    就在这样的情况下，几年以来当地政府和合作社对手工业的改造做了不少工作，手工业生产合作社（下简称生产社）已有很大发展。到去年年底，在合作社直接领导下组织起来的，已有棉织、针织、五金等十一个行业的五十二个社、五千七百多人——内有少数雇员（今年第一季度新发展的和劳动局组织起来拨归上海生产合作社筹委会领导的共七、八个社，三百人左右未计算在内），其中已由手工生产进到程度不等地使用机器生产的有二十个社，各社已经积累了公积金近二百八十亿元，去年年产总值已达到两千八百多亿元。再加上当地政府民政、劳动部门和一些人民团体为救济失业和解决群众生活问题而组织起来的群众生产企业，以及已够条件的自发组织起来的生产社，组织起来的人数要大大超过上述数字，产值也要大大超过上述的产值数字。千千万万的手工业者、手工业工人既经组织起来以后，就改变了过去自己的生产和生活的面貌。
  我们看看上海铁床生产合作社组织起来以后所
                起的变化吧：
    这是在三年前由三十个失业工人发动组织起来的生产社，当时没有资金、没有工具、没有厂房，全凭东借西凑搞起生产来。大家克服了无数困难，到现在已经是一个有二百多人（内有少数雇员）的合作工厂了。几年以来已经积累了三十多亿元的公积金，购买了十二亩厂地、一百多间房子和其他生产设备，更重要的是培养了一批管理干部，创造了经验，这就使大家的生产和生活建筑在可靠的基础上。
    这里消灭了剥削，大家建立了互助合作的生产关系。每一个人都知道过去三年学徒、补师一年
  （补师，即补学一年报答师傅的意思，因为学徒的时候是没有工资的）的苦味的，因此大家互教互学、钻研技术是努力的，这里很快地能比较熟练地掌握操作技术，再也不用几年。例如去年由兄弟社调来几十个人，他们原是做皮鞋的，可是在新的岗位上两、三个月就跟上去了。生产技术上、设备上不断的进步（现在是半机械生产），劳动组织也不断改进。这一切的结果，是生产效率不断提高——一九五○年该社每人平均生产总值是四千多万元，一九五一、一九五二年平均每人年产总值七千多万元，去年每人年产总值已提高到一亿元以上了。产品的质量也逐步提高，成本逐步下降，他们曾一再降低产品售价，对各地订货迎接不暇就是证明。
    随着生产的提高，社员的生活也不断地改善。该社开始时那么困难的情形，谈不上改善生活，每月二、三十万元的工资，是最高的了。现在，最低的工资也超过了这个数目。去年社里用到每一个社员身上的各项福利费用还只有两万元（如医药费等只是补贴性质的），现在社员的医药费已全由社来负责，病假期工资发百分之三十，因公负伤的假期发百分之七十。社里并办了业余学校，现在基本上已经扫除了文盲。
    当然，这对国家和人民都是有好处的。只是去年一年，他们就生产了质量较好的两万两千多只铁床和几百件医疗器械等，供应各地，并在平稳上述产品的市场价格上，起了很大作用。
    很多手工业者过去自发地向资本主义发展碰壁之后，有组织起来的要求，但不知道怎样组织起来，组织起来具体情况又是怎样的。当看到了上述的动人情况后，疑问解决了。已经组织起来的这些生产社，更重要的作用也就在这里。
    但这并不是说一切都毫无问题了。已有的生产社中，资本主义的思想和作风还严重地存在着，这表现在很多工资是偏高的、有的社有时还不愿接受国家的委托加工订货等方面，社员中也还相当严重地存在着自由散漫的习气。因此，必须加强生产社中的政治思想工作和集体主义的教育，整顿业务和经营作风。这些已经在各社开始贯彻，有的社今年第一季度曾调整了生产定额，使工资趋向合理。今后各社在这一方面的工作需要进一步加强。
    更重要的，是对广大的还没有组织起来的手工业户的领导、管理和改造的问题。这方面还存在一些缺点。例如，当地工商管理部门在一些手工业户申请开业登记、领取执照的处理上，就有不妥当的地方（当地的这些工作过去是由区政府工商科办理的）。这里有不少申请开业登记未获准，开业后产销并无大问题，而能长期存在的手工业户（邑庙区有三千户左右的手工业户，未登记的有九百户左右，其中一部分是没有向区工商科申请开业登记，但也有很多是申请而未获准的）。未准登记的理由，往往是：盲目发展，生产过多，不为国计民生所需要，等等。既然还是个体私有的尚未被改造过的经济，当然它是盲目发展的，因此才要积极改造它。是不是已经生产过多，不为国计民生所需要呢？个别的、或某种行业一时的有这种情况；但一般说并不是这样，而是为人民所需要，产销无大问题，许多手工业户未予登记而开业，并能长期存在，就是证明。再如，在发展生产社的组织上，也还落于实际需要之后。这里有很多手工业者，先后向生产社的领导机构，要求组织起来，有的提出了很久，并且基本上也够条件，而未获得及时地，有领导地组织起来。有的已经自发地组织起来（即自发社，如邑庙区关帝庙的大众毛笔社，就是个例子。这是在一九五二年由七十多个制毛笔的工人和独立劳动者组织起来的，每人股金二十万元。开始营业不很好。现在每月可出两、三万支笔，产销问题不大，每人每月平均工资四十万元左右，除缴税及其他开支外，还有盈余。尽管它还有许多缺点，需要整顿和提高，但它是生产合作社性质的企业。他们愿遵守当地生产联社筹委会的规定，申请予以领导，但长时间未得到解决）。
    这些工作中的缺点，显然主要是由于对手工业在当前国家各种经济中的意义、对手工业改造的重要性认识不足而来的。我们积极地领导、管理、改造手工业，这不能被理解为包办它，助长其消极依赖思想（有很多手工业者在各方面表现出来，当前确有这种思想），相反，却能更好地说服消除其消极依赖思想；更不能把积极领导、管理、改造手工业解释为盲目冒进，而是为了更好地正确地贯彻积极稳步地改造手工业的方针。
