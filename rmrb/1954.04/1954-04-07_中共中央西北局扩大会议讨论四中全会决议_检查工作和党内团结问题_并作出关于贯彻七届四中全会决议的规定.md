    (Our newspaper's report from Xi'an on the 6th) The Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee held an enlarged meeting from March 25th to April 1st to convey the spirit of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity." Present and attending the meeting were members of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, first and second secretaries of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau and various provincial (municipal) committees, and senior Party cadres from various provinces (municipalities) and Northwest Region organs, totaling forty-eight people. The meeting first heard a report by Comrade Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, on the spirit of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session. Subsequently, Comrade Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, gave a report entitled "Strive to Strengthen Party Unity and Continue to Victoriously Complete Various Work Tasks," based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and the situation of work and intra-Party unity in the Northwest Region. The comrades present unanimously agreed that the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session was of extreme importance for strengthening Party unity, enhancing the ideological awareness of the entire Party, and ensuring the victorious implementation of the Party's general line during the transition period. The comrades present unanimously expressed their determination to fight for the realization of the Fourth Plenary Session's resolution and conducted extensive criticism and self-criticism based on the spirit of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

    The meeting earnestly examined the work and intra-Party unity in the Northwest Region, especially the unity of leading cadres above the provincial (municipal) committee level and senior leading cadres of the armed forces. It was unanimously agreed that the Party in the Northwest Region is basically united, and this unity is built on the basis of the correct political and organizational line of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, thus making it solid, reliable, and powerful. However, bourgeois individualistic ideas that are detrimental to unity exist among Party members and cadres, and in areas and sectors where political and ideological work is weak, these ideas have grown and developed to some extent. The meeting pointed out that imperialism and all hidden counter-revolutionary elements are constantly attempting to find and create disputes and disunity within our Party in order to exploit these things and sabotage and destroy the cause of our Party and people. It would be extremely dangerous if we were to become complacent and arrogant due to victory, lose the vigilance that a Communist Party member should have, or adopt a vulgar attitude towards the shortcomings existing within the Party and allow them to persist and develop. The meeting decided to convey the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session to Party members and cadres and organize them to study it, requiring Party members and cadres to earnestly examine and overcome all phenomena that are detrimental to unity. When examining and overcoming these shortcomings, in addition to resolutely implementing the spirit of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and the various methods indicated in the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity," the meeting also made the following regulations: 1. Every responsible comrade, especially responsible comrades above the level of the provincial and municipal committees, must participate in the local Party branch life as an ordinary Party member in order to accept the criticism and supervision of the branch and the masses of Party members and to understand the work and life situation of the Party branch. 2. The main responsible comrades of the Party committee should be modest and prudent, strive to study and work hard, and must seriously consider and study the criticisms and opinions of comrades. They must enthusiastically help comrades who work with them to do their work well, learn work experience and theoretical knowledge, so as to ensure that they can truly become the unity and leadership core of the Party committee, and that the Party committee will become the unity and leadership core of all Party members. 3. Party committee meetings, Party representative conferences, and Party congresses should be held on schedule, democracy should be promoted, and criticism and self-criticism should be conducted. The above-mentioned Party meetings must not be replaced by general cadre meetings. 4. Improve Party committees at all levels, pay attention to absorbing outstanding Party member cadres from all ethnic groups to participate in the Party committees, and improve the organization and work of the Party committees.

    中共中央西北局扩大会议讨论四中全会决议
    检查工作和党内团结问题
    并作出关于贯彻七届四中全会决议的规定
    【本报西安六日电】　中共中央西北局从三月二十五日到四月一日举行扩大会议，传达七届四中全会的精神和“关于增强党的团结的决议”。出席和列席会议的有中共中央西北局委员，新疆分局和各省（市）委正副书记及各省（市）与西北区机关高级党员干部共计四十八人。会议首先听了中共中央西北局副书记马文瑞同志关于七届四中全会精神的传达报告，接着由中共中央西北局第三书记马明方同志根据四中全会的精神，结合西北地区工作和党内团结的情况，作了“为增强党的团结继续胜利完成各项工作任务而奋斗”的报告。到会同志一致认为：党的七届四中全会，对于增强党的团结，提高全党的思想觉悟水平，保证党在过渡时期总路线能够得到胜利贯彻，都有极为重要的意义。到会同志一致表示坚决为实现四中全会的决议而斗争，并根据七届四中全会的精神，广泛地进行了批评与自我批评。
    会议对西北地区的工作和党内团结问题，特别是省（市）委员会以上的负责干部和武装部队的高级负责干部的团结问题，认真地进行了检查。一致认为：西北地区的党基本上是团结的，这种团结是建立在党中央和毛泽东同志正确的政治路线和组织路线的基础上的，因而是巩固的、可靠的、有力量的。但不利于团结的资产阶级个人主义思想，在党员和干部中是存在的，在政治思想工作薄弱的方面和部分，这种思想还有所增长和发展。会议指出：帝国主义和一切潜藏的反革命分子，经常打算在我们党内找到并制造一些纠纷和不团结的事情，以便利用这些事情，将我们党和人民的事业加以破坏和毁灭。我们如果因为胜利而骄傲自满，失去共产党人应有的警惕，如果对党内存在的缺点采取庸俗的态度而任其存在和发展下去，那将是极其危险的。会议决定向党员干部传达和组织他们学习七届四中全会的文件，要求党员干部对于一切不利于团结的现象，认真予以检查和克服。在检查和克服这些缺点时，除坚决贯彻七届四中全会的精神和“关于增强党的团结的决议”中所指示的各项办法外，会议还作了规定：一、每个负责同志，特别是省、市委员会以上的负责同志，必须以普通党员的身份参加当地党的支部生活，以便于接受支部和党员群众的批评与监督，了解党支部的工作和生活状况；二、党委会的主要负责同志要虚心谨慎，努力学习和工作，对于同志们的批评和意见，必须认真加以考虑和研究，对于和自己一起工作的同志，必须热忱帮助他们做好工作，学到工作经验和理论知识，以便使自己能够确实成为党的委员会的团结和领导核心，党的委员会又要成为全体党员的团结和领导核心；三、按期开好党的委员会会议，党的代表会议和党的代表大会，发扬民主，进行批评与自我批评，不得以一般干部会议代替上述党的会议；四、健全各级党的委员会，注意吸收各族人民中的优秀党员干部参加到党的委员会中来，健全党委会的组织和工作。
