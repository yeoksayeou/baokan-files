Most of the provincial-level cities (except Jinzhou City) and 166 counties in the six provinces of the Northeast region had completed their first People's Congresses by early April. At the People's Congresses of each city and county, based on the full promotion of democracy, resolutions were discussed and passed regarding the guiding principles and tasks of industrial and agricultural production in 1954, as well as the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations and preparations for spring plowing. The county people's representatives who attended the meetings were all outstanding individuals who had emerged from general elections and were supported and loved by the masses. For example, among the representatives from 41 counties (banners) in Heilongjiang Province, 22% were labor models at or above the county level.

Before the convening of the first People's Congresses in each city and county, extensive publicity was carried out and proposals were collected. In Xifeng County, 300 propagandists were trained before the meeting to carry out extensive publicity to the voters, and people's visit reception rooms were set up to receive the masses and collect opinions and demands. The county collected 541 proposals. The proposals at this time at the People's Congresses of each city and county were generally several times more numerous than at previous People's Representative Conferences. There were also many important and constructive suggestions in the proposals. For example, the masses in Longjiang County suggested that the government repair the dam from Yin River to Arong River, which could save 5,500 hectares of fertile land from flooding. The government has also seriously dealt with these valuable opinions.

The People's Congresses of each county focused on discussing spring plowing and this year's production increase tasks, the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and other issues. The People's Congress in Zhaodong County determined that this year each hectare of land should produce five more *dou* of grain than last year, consolidate the existing 46 agricultural production cooperatives, and establish 98 new ones. The resolution of the People's Congress of Pingquan County proposed that this year, all efforts should be concentrated on agricultural production to strive for the production of 85,000 tons of grain (an increase of 14% in output per unit area compared with last year). In terms of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the county will establish 83 new agricultural production cooperatives this year, focusing on cultivating 300 mutual aid teams, so that the organized farmers account for 80% of the total number of households in the county.

In order to ensure the completion of the production increase task, the people's representatives of each county repeatedly and conscientiously discussed specific methods for increasing production at the meeting. When the people's representatives of Zhaodong County began to discuss, they lacked confidence in completing the production increase task, believing that there was a lack of fertilizer. After Representative Ma Fushuang introduced the experience of Sanhe Village (a high-yield model village in Heilongjiang Province) in accumulating fertilizer, the representatives all expressed that they would actively develop fertilizer sources and apply fertilizer reasonably, and use more "night soil" and "ground manure" to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. In order to help the masses solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer, the government also decided to vigorously organize "city manure" to go to the countryside. At the People's Congresses of many counties, the difficulties of insufficient animal feed and fertilizer in spring plowing were effectively resolved, which strongly promoted spring plowing work.

The People's Congresses of each city mainly discussed urban work based on the general line: clarifying that industrial production must be the main focus, and all other work must serve production. The conference also discussed how to strengthen the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce.

The people's representatives of each city and county conscientiously exercised their democratic rights, elected county heads, deputy county heads, mayors, and deputy mayors, and elected people's representatives to the provincial People's Congress. Yang Xianting and Meng Qingyu, famous agricultural labor models in Heilongjiang Province, as well as female tractor driver Sa Ren and Shen Fengqin, chairman of the Xinsheng Collective Farm, were all elected as provincial people's representatives.

After the People's Congress was held, each city and county is actively implementing the resolutions of the conference. After the closing of the People's Congress, Keshan County immediately convened a meeting of the County People's Government Committee to study specific implementation methods. Immediately, responsible comrades such as the county party secretary, deputy secretary, and deputy county head of the County People's Government led 168 cadres to go deep into the countryside to assist the county people's representatives in carrying out implementation. Now, the masses are actively taking action. The masses in many counties are also working hard to implement the resolutions of the People's Congress.

    东北区的大部分省属市和一百六十六个县
    全部开完第一次人民代表大会
    东北区六个省所属市（锦州市除外）和一百六十六个县，到四月上旬已全部开完第一次人民代表大会。各市、县的人民代表大会在充分发扬民主的基础上，讨论并通过了一九五四年工业农业生产方针、任务和关于发展互助合作组织及备耕等工作的决议。参加会议的县人民代表，都是在普选中涌现出来的为群众所拥护和爱戴的优秀人物。如黑龙江省四十一个县（旗）的代表中，有百分之二十二是县以上的劳动模范。
    各市、县第一次人民代表大会召开前，都广泛地进行了宣传和搜集提案。西丰县会前训练了三百名宣传员，广泛向选民们进行了宣传，并设立了人民来访接待室接见群众，搜集意见和要求。该县搜集的提案达五百四十一件。这次各市、县人民代表大会提案普遍比历次人民代表会议增多数倍。提案中并有很多重要的建设性的意见，如龙江县群众建议政府修治阴河到阿荣河的水坝，可使五千五百垧肥沃良田免遭水灾。这些宝贵的意见政府也都认真地进行了处理。
    各县人民代表大会，都集中讨论了春耕和今年的增产任务、发展互助合作组织等问题。肇东县在人民代表大会上确定：今年每垧地要比去年增产五斗粮，巩固已有的四十六个农业生产合作社，并再新办九十八个社。平泉县人民代表大会的决议中提出：今年在农业生产上要集中一切力量，为生产八万五千吨粮食（比去年单位面积产量增加百分之十四）而奋斗。在互助合作组织方面，全县今年新办八十三个农业生产合作社，重点培养三百个互助组，使组织起来的农户占全县总户数的百分之八十。
    为了保证增产任务的完成，各县的人民代表们在会上都反复认真地讨论了增产的具体办法。肇东县的人民代表开始讨论时，对完成增产任务信心不足，认为粪源缺乏，后经马福双代表介绍三合村
  （黑龙江省丰产模范村）的积肥经验后，代表们都表示要积极开辟粪源，并要合理施肥，多“摅口粪”“捡地粪”，以解决粪源不足的困难。政府为帮助群众解决粪不足问题，也决定大力组织“城粪”下乡。许多县的人民代表大会上，都切实地解决了备耕中马料和肥料不足的困难，有力地推动了春耕工作。
    各市人民代表大会主要是根据总路线讨论了城市工作：明确了必须以工业生产为主，其他一切工作都要为生产服务。大会也讨论了如何加强对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造等问题。
    各市、县人民代表都认真地行使了自己的民主权利，选出了县长、副县长、市长、副市长，并选出了出席省人民代表大会的人民代表。黑龙江省著名的农业劳动模范杨显亭、孟庆余及女拖拉机手萨仁、新生集体农庄主席沈凤琴等都当选了省人民代表。
    人民代表大会开过以后，各市、县正积极贯彻大会决议。克山县于人民代表大会闭幕后，即召开了县人民政府委员会研究了具体贯彻办法，当即由县委书记、副书记、县人民政府副县长等负责同志率领一百六十八名干部分头深入农村协助县人民代表进行贯彻。现在，群众都积极行动起来。许多县的群众也都积极为贯彻人民代表大会决议在紧张地劳动着。
