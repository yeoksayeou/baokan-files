Comrades, honored guests:

On behalf of the Central Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, I congratulate you on the opening of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technological Innovation Exhibition!

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has made great achievements in technological innovation, thereby significantly increasing labor productivity and improving working conditions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is using this exhibition to introduce these achievements to workers, economic workers, and trade union workers across the country, which will surely greatly promote technological innovation in factories, mines, transportation enterprises, and basic construction units nationwide.

The mass technological innovation movement of Anshan Iron and Steel Company provides a correct direction for factories, mines, and transportation enterprises across the country to transform old equipment, adopt new technologies, and further tap the potential of enterprises. Therefore, we attach great importance to and actively support this movement.

As our country has entered a period of planned economic construction, on the one hand, we must complete many new and expanded factories, first of all, completing the 141 large-scale projects. These new and expanded factories will fully adopt Soviet modern equipment, so that our socialist industry will be placed on a high technological foundation from the very beginning. On the other hand, we must cherish our existing factories, mines, and transportation enterprises and, based on the specific conditions of each enterprise, actively innovate them technologically, relying on the wisdom and strength of the working class, to fully tap the potential of equipment and increase labor productivity. This kind of innovation in production technology is equally necessary and possible in basic construction. Technological innovation in basic construction is of great significance to the victorious completion of the 141 projects and the acceleration of national industrialization.

Transforming existing equipment and fully exploiting the maximum potential of existing enterprise equipment is a very complex task. The implementation of any innovation proposal may cause significant changes in enterprise production, and therefore it is easy to encounter some setbacks or resistance. Therefore, the leading cadres of enterprises must first give strong support to the initiators of innovation, and secondly, they must improve the leadership of the enterprise along with the improvement of the enterprise's technological foundation. Many facts at Anshan Iron and Steel Company prove that if the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses receive correct leadership and support, they can achieve great achievements, and the improvement of enterprise management level promotes the development of technological innovation movement.

Are there currently bureaucratic phenomena of burying the proposals of innovators and not giving support to innovators? Yes, even quite a lot. Some leading cadres of enterprises lack a keen sense of new things, do not pay attention to the proposals of innovators, and dare not give bold support. They often bury the rationalization proposals of the masses with excuses such as tight production tasks or "not enough conditions" or "need to be handled carefully." This kind of conservatism, turning a blind eye to the creativity of the working class, must be overcome.

In socialist enterprises, the advanced leading the backward and the backward catching up with the advanced is the law of forward development. The leaders of enterprises must pay attention to the newly emerging advanced things, support those newly emerging advanced things, and remove various obstacles on the road to their advancement. All of this, in general, is a matter of relying on the masses. Relying on the masses and learning from the Soviet Union are the two basic principles for us to lead economic work. The leading cadres of enterprises must rely on the masses and learn from the Soviet Union to innovate production technology and improve management level.

Currently, labor competitions with technological innovation as the main content are developing rapidly in factories and mining enterprises across the country. This marks that labor competitions have begun to enter a new stage. Enterprise leaders should be very concerned about this new situation, actively support the correct proposals of innovators, publicize the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and resolutely oppose various conservative ideas. As long as the leading cadres of the party, administration, and trade union organizations in the enterprise can stand on the side of the advanced masses, then all backward ideas and all difficulties can be overcome.

I believe that the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technological Innovation Exhibition can help the development of technological innovation movement, help the improvement of enterprise leadership, and help inspire and improve the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class across the country to complete the great historical task of national industrialization.

### 中央财经委员会副主任李富春同志的讲话

    中央财经委员会副主任李富春同志的讲话
    同志们、各位来宾们：
    我代表中央人民政府财经委员会祝贺鞍钢技术革新展览会的开幕！
    鞍山钢铁公司在中国共产党的领导下和苏联专家的具体帮助下，在革新技术方面取得了很大的成就，从而显著地提高了劳动生产率，改善了劳动条件。中华全国总工会把这些成就用展览会的形式向全国职工、经济工作者和工会工作者加以介绍，这对于全国各厂、矿、交通企业和基本建设单位的技术革新必将发生很大推动作用。
    鞍山钢铁公司群众性的技术革新运动，为全国各厂、矿、交通企业改造旧的设备，采用新的技术，进一步发挥企业潜力，提供了一个正确方向，因此，我们对这个运动是十分重视而且积极支持的。
    当我国已经进入了有计划的经济建设的时期，我们一方面要完成许多新建和扩建的工厂，首先是完成一四一项规模宏大的工程，在这些新建和扩建的工厂中完全采用苏联的近代化的设备，使我国社会主义工业一开始就放在高度的技术基础之上。另一方面，对于我们原有的厂、矿、交通企业，必须十分珍视，并根据各个企业的具体情况依靠工人阶级的智慧与力量积极地从技术上加以革新，充分发挥设备潜力，提高劳动生产率。这种生产技术上的革新，在基本建设方面也是同样必要和可能的。基本建设方面的技术革新，对于胜利地完成一四一项工程加速国家工业化有着重大意义。
    改造现有的设备，充分发挥现有企业设备的最大潜力，是一件很复杂的工作，任何一件革新建议的实施都可能引起企业生产的重大变化，因而也就很容易遇到一些挫折或抵抗，所以企业的领导干部，首先必须给革新的倡议者以有力的支持，其次必须随着企业技术基础的改进来改进企业的领导。鞍钢的许多事实证明，群众的积极性与创造性，如果得到了正确的领导与支持，就能够获得巨大的成就，而企业管理水平的提高又促进技术革新运动的开展。
    目前是不是有埋没革新者的倡议，不给革新者以支持的官僚主义现象呢？有的，甚至是相当多的。有些企业的领导干部对新鲜事物缺乏敏锐的感觉，对革新者的倡议不予重视，不敢给予大胆支持，往往以生产任务紧或以“还不够条件”以“需要慎重处理”之类的借口把群众的合理化建议埋葬了。这种因循保守对工人阶级的创造熟视无睹的现象是必须克服的。
    在社会主义的企业里，先进的带动落后的，落后的赶上先进的，是向前发展的规律，企业的领导者必须注意新生的先进的东西，支持那些新生的先进的东西，为新生的先进的东西扫除前进道路上的各种障碍。这些，总起来说就是依靠群众的问题。依靠群众和学习苏联，是我们领导经济工作的两条基本原则，企业的领导干部必须依靠群众，学习苏联，来革新生产技术，提高管理水平。
    目前全国各厂、矿企业以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛正在日益发展，这标志着劳动竞赛开始走上一个新的阶段，企业领导干部应十分关怀这个新的情况，积极地支持革新者的正确倡议，宣传苏联的先进经验，坚决反对各种保守思想。只要企业中党的、行政的、工会组织的领导干部能够站在先进群众方面，那末，一切落后思想和一切困难都是可以克服的。
    我相信鞍钢技术革新展览会，能够有助于技术革新运动的发展，有助于企业领导工作的改进。有助于启发和提高全国工人阶级的积极性和创造性，来完成国家工业化的伟大的历史任务。
