Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 9th: The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a reporting conference in Xi'an from April 6th to 8th for Party cadres at or above the level of Prefectural Committee members and County Committee members from various organs and organizations in the Northwest Region. The conference focused on conveying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the resolutions and spirit of the Northwest Bureau's enlarged meeting. Responsible Party cadres from various organs, organizations in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, as well as the Xi'an-based organs and troops of the Northwest Military Region, also attended the conference.

At the conference, Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, first conveyed the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity." Subsequently, Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, conveyed the spirit of the Northwest Bureau's enlarged meeting and the report "Striving to Enhance Party Unity and Continue to Successfully Complete Various Tasks," which was adopted by the meeting. In their reports, they called on the participating Party cadres to conscientiously abide by the resolutions and spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau's enlarged meeting. They emphasized the need to seriously examine and overcome all bourgeois individualistic thoughts that are harmful to Party unity, so as to improve the ideological awareness of each Party member, strengthen Party unity, and struggle for the implementation of the Party's general line during the transition period.

This reporting conference was conducted on the basis of the study of the Party's general line during the transition period and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee by all Party cadres. As early as February 20th, the Northwest Bureau issued a notice on studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. The notice required that through this study, all Party members should recognize the importance of strengthening Party unity, strengthening the Party's unified leadership, and adhering to the Party's principle of collective leadership during the current great socialist transformation period; recognize the harm to the Party and the people's cause of all erroneous thoughts and behaviors that hinder Party unity, hinder the Party's unified leadership, and undermine the Party's collective leadership; and, on the basis of raising awareness, examine and correct the shortcomings and errors of each Party member in this regard. From the end of February, Party cadres of first-level organs and organizations in the Northwest Region have generally carried out studies in accordance with this notice. The Party organizations of many organs and organizations have also conducted inspections on the ideological conditions of cadres in conjunction with the assessment of Party members and cadres, and have carried out criticism and self-criticism.

Through this reporting conference, the participating Party cadres were further profoundly educated. They are all prepared to conduct in-depth inspections and seek practical improvements in strengthening Party unity, promoting intra-Party democracy, strengthening collective leadership, and strengthening political and ideological work, based on the work of each unit and the actual ideological situation of the cadres, and on the basis of extensively carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

In addition, the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Provincial Committees of the CPC in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and the Xi'an Municipal Committee, will also hold enlarged meetings of the Party committees in the coming days to convey and discuss the resolutions and spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Bureau.

    西北局号召党员干部克服个人主义思想
      【新华社西安九日电】中共中央西北局，在四月六日到八日在西安市召集西北区各机关、团体中相当于地委委员以上和县委委员以上的党员干部，分别举行关于中共七届四中全会和西北局扩大会议的决议和精神的传达报告大会。参加大会的还有陕西省和西安市各机关团体以及西北军区驻西安机关部队中负责的党员干部。
    大会先由西北局副书记马文瑞传达中共七届四中全会的精神和“关于增强党的团结的决议”，继由西北局第三书记马明方传达西北局扩大会议的精神和会议所通过的“为增强党的团结继续胜利完成各项工作任务而奋斗”的报告。他们在报告中号召到会的党员干部，切实遵照七届四中全会和西北局扩大会议的决议和精神，对于一切有害于党的团结的资产阶级个人主义思想，必须认真予以检查和克服，以提高每个党员的思想觉悟水平，增强党的团结，为贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线而斗争。
    这次传达报告大会是在全体党员干部学习了党在过渡时期的总路线和七届四中全会文件的基础上进行的。西北局早在二月二十日便发出关于学习七届四中全会文件的通知。通知要求通过这次学习，使所有党员认识目前党在伟大的社会主义改造时期加强党的团结、加强党的统一领导、坚持党的集体领导原则的重要性；认识一切妨碍党的团结、妨碍党的统一领导、破坏党的集体领导的错误思想和行为对党和人民事业的危害性；并在提高认识的基础上，检查和改正每个党员在这一方面的缺点和错误。西北区一级各机关团体的党员干部从二月底起，遵照这个通知，已普遍进行了学习。许多机关团体的党的组织，并结合党员干部鉴定，就干部的思想状况进行了检查，开展了批评和自我批评。
    经过这次传达报告大会，使到会的党员干部进一步受到了深刻的教育。都准备结合各单位的工作和干部的思想实际，在广泛开展批评和自我批评的基础上，对增强党的团结、发扬党内民主、加强集体领导、加强政治思想工作等方面，进行深入的检查并求得切实的改进。
    此外，中共中央新疆分局、中共陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏等省委和西安市委，日内亦即将举行党委扩大会议，传达和讨论中共七届四中全会和西北局扩大会议的决议和精神。
