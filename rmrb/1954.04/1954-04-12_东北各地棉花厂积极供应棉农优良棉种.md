    Cotton Factories in Northeast China Actively Supply Cotton Farmers with High-Quality Cotton Seeds
    Cotton factories under the leadership of the Northeast China Branch of the China General Merchandise Company are actively supplying cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas with high-quality cotton seeds. By mid-March, they had supplied 7,000 tons of cotton seeds.
    This year, the cotton-producing areas of Northeast China, including Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe provinces, as well as the suburban areas of Lüda and Anshan cities, plan to plant 300,000 hectares of cotton, an expansion of 9% compared to last year's cotton planting area. Efforts are being made to achieve a total raw cotton output of 80,000 tons. To support farmers in increasing cotton production, the Commercial Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, with the approval of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee, has appropriately lowered the price of cotton seeds supplied to farmers. Cotton factories in various locations generally started supplying cotton seeds to farmers in February and March. The Beizhen County Cotton Factory in Liaoxi Province had supplied farmers with 812 tons of cotton seeds by March 26th. It is expected that all the cotton seeds needed by cotton farmers in the region will be supplied in time before spring plowing and planting. Cotton factories and agricultural departments in various cotton-producing areas have also reserved a portion of cotton seeds to meet the needs of farmers for replanting seedlings after spring plowing.

    东北各地棉花厂积极供应棉农优良棉种
    中国百货公司东北区公司领导的各产棉区棉花厂正积极供应棉农优良棉种，到三月中旬止，已供应棉种七千吨。
    今年东北产棉地区辽东、辽西、热河三省及旅大、鞍山两市郊区准备种植棉花三十万垧，比去年棉田播种面积扩大百分之九；争取皮棉总产量达到八万吨。为了扶助农民增产棉花，东北行政委员会商业局经东北财政经济委员会批准，适当降低了供应农民的棉种价格。各地棉花厂一般在二、三月份即开始供应农民棉种。辽西省北镇县棉花厂到三月二十六日止，已供应给农民八百一十二吨棉种。预计在春耕播种前，全区棉农所需棉种可以及时供应完毕。各产棉地区的棉花厂和农业部门还储备了一部分棉种，准备供应农民春耕后补苗的需要。
