    Two kinds of crops in one cooperative
    By our reporter Lin Mo
    Last year, the Xinmin Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, became famous in the Chengdu Plain because all kinds of crops grew well. This year, the cooperative has expanded from fifteen households to more than one hundred and sixty households. Farmers from nearby counties who are preparing to build cooperatives and those who have just built cooperatives have come to learn skills. Visitors come and go all day long, and some relatives who have not been in contact with the village for many years have also come to visit. Before people enter the village, they can see that the cooperative's crops are growing well. Look at those rapeseed (oilseed rape), one piece connected to another, all in bloom. From afar, you can see a yellow, bright expanse. When the wind blows, the waves of rapeseed flowers are like brocade woven with gold threads. Even on cloudy days, this area feels particularly bright, and when the sun shines, it is even more dazzling. Visitors approached the rapeseed fields and saw layers upon layers of flowers, high and low, densely clustered on the branches. The lower leaves were a dark green, and the middle stems were thick and strong. As they watched, everyone couldn't help but discuss, "Looking at this rapeseed, you can't even throw a clod of dirt into the field." "Hey, even a sparrow couldn't fly out if it got in!" Some careful people wanted to count how many flowers were on a single rapeseed plant, but as they counted, the wind blew and they lost count.
    As people walked along a main road south of the village, the rapeseed got better and better. The more they looked, the more envious they became. They slowly walked to a fork in the road east of the village and suddenly discovered that the rapeseed in this area was very different: the leaves were soft and limp, some were yellowing, the stems were thin, and the flowers were sparse, like a weak patient. At first, they thought it was a crop outside the cooperative, but when they asked, they found out it was also part of the cooperative. Everyone was a little surprised. Some people didn't say anything, but thought to themselves, "This rapeseed isn't even as good as our mutual aid team's!"
    Why are there good and bad crops growing in one cooperative?
    The Xinmin Village Agricultural Production Cooperative has a total of nine production teams. The rapeseed that grew poorly was cultivated by the third team, and the rapeseed that grew well next to it was cultivated by the fifth team. The cultivated areas of the third and fifth teams are adjacent to each other, and the people also live close by. In terms of the conditions of the two teams, the third team has a stronger labor force than the fifth team. They have more middle peasants, and many of them are experienced farmers. Why is the third team's rapeseed not as well cultivated as the fifth team's? The people of the third team will certainly offer many reasons: their land is not as good as the fifth team's, some of the rapeseed was replanted after the expansion of the cooperative, etc. But people can also see that, even taking the replanted rapeseed of the two teams as an example, the third team's is not as good as the fifth team's.
    If we put aside the crops for a moment and look at the leadership of the two team leaders and the labor attitude of the members, the problem becomes clear.
    When the third team holds meetings, the discussion on planned production and labor allocation is very simple. There is even less ideological education for the members. The most lively and attractive topic is the evaluation of work points. People with strong labor power say that their points are rated too low, and those with weak labor power complain that they have suffered a loss. Sometimes, for one person's extra or missing half a point, they will review and debate for several nights in a row. If they can't reach a consensus at the night meeting, they will compare their strength on the spot while working during the day, and the more they compare, the more dissatisfied they become with each other. Some people, in order to do it quickly and get more points, do the work sloppily. The regulations stipulate that each batch of manure water should be poured on four rapeseed plants, but some people pour it on five or six. They work for work points, and they are unwilling to do the jobs with fewer points. Weeding and earthing up rapeseed is a land processing activity during the slack farming season, and the work points set by the cooperative are lower, so some people do not do the work and run to the market. The captain and group leader run around calling people, and half a day's work is delayed. The cooperative decided to universally spread saltpeter mud (old wall base soil) in the rapeseed fields, which is a good way to increase soil fertility. The team mobilized everyone to lend some clay bricks to dismantle and exchange old walls, but no one with clay bricks was willing to take them out. There was less saltpeter mud in the rapeseed fields, and the time was delayed. The team didn't keep a tight grip on the work, and the rapeseed was behind in fertilizing and watering. How can crops grow well if they are hungry and thirsty?
    This labor attitude of the third team members is inseparable from the leadership of the captain. The captain, Ren Siming, takes everything very simply. When the cooperative arranges any work, he often explains it to everyone in a few words and then finishes it. He rarely consults with the group leaders about the team's production and the members' thoughts. Many jobs are arranged just before starting, and sometimes the production is affected because of a lack of farm tools and less manure water, which causes people to be idle and unable to work.
    Ren Siming feels that being a captain is not easy, and often complains to the cooperative director, but compared with the fifth team captain, his ability is not weak. The main reason is that his thinking is not quite right. Originally, he joined the cooperative, but half of his heart remained outside. Sometimes he thinks to himself: in previous years, when he didn't join the cooperative, he did the work in his own fields loosely, and he could still find time to go out and earn some money. Now that he has joined the cooperative and become a cadre, he feels like he has been tied down tightly. He saw other members taking the time to grow some chili seedlings and selling them at the market for hundreds of thousands, and he became envious. So he took the time to grow some eggplant seedlings. The cooperative was preparing to promote new farm tools and wanted to send him to Chengdu to study. The cooperative cadres explained to him how good the new farm tools were and that in the future, when the entire cooperative used them, they would be able to harvest a lot more grain. But Ren Siming was focused on his own eggplant seedlings, and no amount of persuasion could convince him to go. Sometimes, Ren Siming was unhappy when he spent a day busy with the cooperative's affairs without working in the fields to earn work points. Later, when the cooperative held meetings, he simply acted like he was on official duty, taking turns with the women's captain to attend.
    If a captain is so passive about the cooperative's affairs, of course the team's work will not be grasped tightly.
    The situation in the fifth team is very different. It is so difficult to evaluate work points in the third team, but it is very easy in the fifth team: every day after finishing work, the group leader takes charge and evaluates everyone's points while standing on the edge of the field. The people of the fifth team all understand that it is useless to just earn work points, and that it is important to cultivate the fields well and produce more grain. Everyone often says: if there is less food in the pot, no one's bowl will be full!
    The reason why the fifth team members have such an understanding is because the team cadres have carried out correct leadership and education. The fifth team captain, Dai Xianzhi, is a progressive young man, and his whole family is wholeheartedly trying to run the cooperative well. His younger brother, Dai Xianzhong, serves as the team's accountant, and even his fifty-year-old mother has become an activist among the women after joining the cooperative. Their family discusses the cooperative's work while eating.
    Although Captain Dai Xianzhi doesn't know much about growing crops, he is willing to learn from others humbly. In the fifth team's office, team cadres and activists often gather at night; after eating dinner, they always come together to chat for a while. Everyone talks about the happy life of socialism and how the team can compete with other teams. As they chat, they unknowingly come up with new ways to work and discover new shortcomings. When formulating the spring production plan, the team cadres and activists discussed it for two and a half nights. They repeatedly studied the nature of each piece of land, what fertilizer should be used, and how to cultivate it. The rice should be sparsely planted, with the spacing between nests and rows set at eight to nine inches; some people said that this was too dense and that the rake would not be able to get in for weeding. They immediately used a ruler to measure it and found this year's new style rake to test it. Applying base fertilizer for rice requires scattering it into the furrow along the plow, which is a good way; some people say that this is too labor-intensive and that they are afraid that the manpower will not be able to keep up. They then calculated in detail the labor force required for spring plowing. Once the cadres reached a consensus, they further studied how to mobilize the members. The next day, while working in the fields, the cadres and activists chatted with the members. In the evening, the captain gathered them again to report on the results of the brewing and the members' thoughts. After such repeated brewing and discussion up and down, and in-depth mobilization of the masses, the plans were formulated with specific measures at every step, and everyone had a high degree of confidence.
    The team cadres carefully discuss and study the arrangement of work at each stage and the ideological emotions of the members. Getting up early and approaching night, the captain often pulls a few people to look at the crops, talking while walking. After a trip back, they check the cultivation of the previous day and arrange the work that should be done as soon as possible. It has only been two or three months since everyone joined the cooperative and worked together, but the captain and group leader have almost figured out the thoughts and temperaments of each member. If anyone has something on their mind that they can't figure out, or if anyone has a small disagreement with someone, they will promptly explain it. Team member Ye Zhonglin used to have a very strange temper and couldn't get along with anyone in the mutual aid team. After joining the cooperative, after continuous help and education, he has now become an activist on the team. Ye Zhonglin used to be a hired laborer and a bachelor. He was allocated a piece of land during the land reform, but he felt that there was not enough work to do, and the income was not enough to eat and wear. It was a problem for him to live alone, let alone find a wife and start a family; he was often unhappy, and his words were not good. Dai Xianzhi saw through his thoughts and often talked to him: the cooperative has plenty of work to do, as long as you work hard and run the cooperative well, your personal path will be wide; living will not be a problem, and it will be easy to find a partner. These words spoke to his heart. Ye Zhonglin became happy and his temper changed; when working in the cooperative, he wanted to use all his strength, and when discussing anything, he wanted to pour out his heart.
    There are also many problems that occur in the fifth team. For example, in the first few days of working in the fields, some members were arguing over work points; among the three group leaders, two always rated their own points higher first, and the other group leader, although he did not openly argue for points, always felt that he was earning fewer points, and couldn't sleep at night. They promptly reviewed these problems and used them as educational materials for the members. There are many other ways for the fifth team members to conduct self-education: they read newspapers regularly, summarize production, and hold self-criticism meetings. Some old women have only been in the cooperative for two or three months, but they also know how to self-criticize. They have put a lot of effort into ideological education, so the members are enthusiastic about the cooperative and have great energy. When they say they want to put saltpeter mud in the fields, everyone competes to take out their own clay bricks to dismantle and exchange wall corners; when the cooperative wants to build houses, everyone competes to sign up to work. The crops on their team are fertilized and watered as they should be, just like a mother caring for a child, not letting them go hungry or thirsty. How can such crops not grow well?
    Now, the leading cadres of the cooperative are strengthening their leadership over the third team and helping the third team to catch up with the spring crops.

    一个社里两样庄稼
    本报记者  林沫
    四川省新繁县新民村农业生产合作社去年因为样样庄稼长得好，在成都坝子上出了名。今年，这个合作社已经由十五户扩大到一百六十多户，附近几个县准备建社和刚刚建社的农民，都跑来学本事，参观的人来来往往整天不断，村里有些多年没有来往的亲戚也来串门子了。人们还没进村，就看到合作社的庄稼长得就是好。看那些菜籽（油菜）呀，一块连一块，花都开了，老远就望见黄澄澄的一片。风一吹，那菜花的波浪就像用金线织的锦缎一样，阴天走过这里，都觉得这片地方格外明亮，太阳一照，更是金光耀眼。参观的人走近菜籽田，只见上面开的花，里一层，外一层，高一层，低一层，密密丛丛黏在枝头上；下边的叶子，绿的发黑；中间的枝秆，又粗又壮。看着看着，大家不由得议论开了：“看这菜籽呀，你往田里丢一团土巴也丢不进。”“嘿，就连雀子钻进去也飞不出来呀！”有些细心人，想要数一数一颗菜籽开有多少花，数着数着，风一吹，又数不清了。
    人们沿着村南边一条大路看过去，菜籽是一块强似一块，大家越看越眼热，慢慢走到村东边一条岔路口上，突然发现，这一带的菜籽却大不一样了：叶子软绵绵的，有些发黄，秆秆又瘦，花开得稀稀洒洒的，像是身体虚弱的病人。起初，还以为这是社外的庄稼，问了，才知道这也是合作社的，大家都有些奇怪了。有的人嘴里不言语，心里却说：“看这菜籽呀，还不如我们那互助组的好哩！”
    为什么一个社里会长出好坏两样庄稼呢？
    新民村农业生产合作社共有九个生产队，那些长得差的菜籽是第三队耕种的，旁边长得好的是第五队的。三队和五队的耕作区相挨着，人也住的邻近。拿两个队的条件说，三队的劳动力比五队还要强，他们中农多，很多人是做庄稼的老手。为什么三队的菜籽作务得不如五队好呢？三队的人当然也会提出不少理由：他们的土地不如五队好啦，有些菜籽是扩社以后才补种的啦等等。可是人们也看得出，就拿两队补种的菜籽来说，三队的也不如五队。
    如果先撇开庄稼不谈，看一看两个队长的领导和队员的劳动态度，问题就明白了。
    三队开起会来，对计划生产、调配劳动力，都谈得很简单；对队员的思想教育，就更少了；大家吵得最热闹、最吸引人的却是评工分。劳动力强的人，说自己的分评低了，劳动力弱的喊自己吃了亏。有时为一个人多一分、少半分，会接连评论几个晚上；夜晚开会评不下来，又在白天做活时当场比强弱，越比就互相越不服气了。有的人为了做得快，多得分，活路却做得粗糙了；一档档粪水规定淋四窝菜籽，有的人却淋上五、六窝。为了工分干活，分少的活路就不愿做了。菜籽抅厢培土，因为是农闲时期的土地加工活，社里定的工分就低一些，有些人就不做活路，跑去赶场。队长、组长到处跑着喊人，半天的活路也给耽误了。社里决定要普遍往菜籽田里丢硝泥（旧墙脚的泥土），这是增加土地肥力的好办法。队上动员大家借出些土砖拆换旧墙，但有土砖的人谁也不愿往外拿。菜籽田里硝泥丢少了，时间也拖迟了，队上对活路抓得又不紧，菜籽淋粪、浇水，步步都落在人家后面。庄稼饿了吃不上肥料，渴了得不到水喝，怎么会长得好呢？
    三队队员的这种劳动态度，是和队长的领导分不开的。队长任思明把啥事都看得很简单，社里布置下什么工作，他常是三言两语向大家交代下去就完了，全队的生产、队员的思想，很少和组长商量研究，很多活路，都是临动手才布置下来，有时因为缺农具，少粪水，人闲下来使不上，生产也受了影响。
    任思明觉得队长不好当，常向社长叫苦，但和五队队长比起来，他的能力并不弱，主要的还是他的思想不大对。原来他是人入了社，心还有一半留在外头。有时他一个人在想：往年没入社，自己田里的活也做的松松活活的，一年还能抽空出去挣些工钱，如今入了社，又当了干部，一个人算是给绑得死死的了。他见别的社员抽空自己养些海椒秧子，担到场上，能卖上十几二十万，自己也眼热了。他就抽空养了些茄子秧。社里准备推广新式农具，要派他到成都去学习。社里的干部向他解释，新式农具如何好，将来全社使用起来，能够多打好多粮食，但任思明一心想到自己的茄子秧子，怎么动员他也不去。有时候，任思明为社里的事情忙上一天，自己没有到田里做活挣工分，就不高兴；后来社里开会，他就索性像支公差一样，和妇女队长两个人轮流去。
    一个队长，对社里的事情都是这么消极不前，队上的工作当然也就不会抓紧的了。
    五队的情形就大不相同。三队评起工分来那么费劲，但在五队却很省事：大家每天作完活，由小组长掌握着，站在田坎上就把每人的分评妥了。五队的人都明白：光挣工分没有用，要把田种好，多打粮食才算事。大家常说：锅里饭少，谁碗里也多不了啊！
    五队的队员所以有这样的认识，是因为队上的干部进行了正确的领导和教育。五队队长戴先智是一个进步的青年，他全家都一心要想把合作社办好。他弟弟戴先忠担任队上的会计，连他那五十多岁的老母亲入社后也成了妇女中间的积极分子。他们一家人，吃起饭来都在讨论社里的工作。
    队长戴先智对种庄稼虽然懂得不深，但他肯虚心向别人学习。在五队的办公室里，夜晚经常聚集着队上的干部和积极分子；他们吃了夜饭，总要到一起拉扯一阵。大家从社会主义的幸福生活，谈到本队如何和别队比赛，扯着扯着，不觉的就对工作提出些新的办法，发现些新的缺点。订大春生产计划时，队上的干部和积极分子整整讨论了两个半夜。对每块田土的性质、应该使用什么肥料、如何耕作，都反复研究。稻子要作到稀秧密植，窝、行距定为八寸到九寸；有人说这样太密了，薅秧就下不去钉耙。他们当时就用尺子比量，又找到今年的新式钉耙来试验。种稻子施底肥，要顺犁沟往里撒，这是个好办法；有人说，这样作太费工，怕人手赶不上。他们就打起算盘，详细计算了春耕所需用的劳动力。干部认识一致了，又进一步研究如何发动队员。第二天在田间作活的时候，干部、积极分子就同队员们拉扯起来了。到晚上队长又召集他们汇报酝酿的结果和队员的思想情况。经过这样上下反复酝酿讨论，深入发动了群众，所以订出的计划步步都有具体办法，人人都有很高的信心。
    对每一个阶段活路的安排啦，队员的思想情绪啦，队上的干部都勤商量，细研究。起早临晚，队长常拉上几个人去看庄稼，边看边拉扯，走一趟回来，对头天的耕作进行了检查，该作的活路，就及早作了安排。大家入社后在一起干活才不过两三个月，队长、组长对每个队员的心思、脾气都摸个差不多了。谁心里有啥事想不通，谁和谁闹了点小意见，就及时给解释开了。队员叶中林过去脾气很怪，在互助组里和谁也合不来，入社以后，经过不断的帮助和教育，现在却成了队上的积极分子。叶中林原来是个雇工单身汉，土地改革时分了一份田，他觉得，活路不够做，收入又不够吃穿，一个人生活还成问题，更不用说讨老婆成家了；心里常常不如意，出口也就没有好言好语。戴先智看透了他的心思，就常和他谈：合作社有的是活路，只要好好劳动，把合作社搞好，个人的路就宽了；生活不成问题，找个对象也容易。这些话句句说到他心里。叶中林心里高兴起来，脾气也就改变了；在合作社干起活来，恨不得把一身的气力都使上，讨论个啥事情，恨不得把心都掏出来。
    五队里边，发生的问题也是很多的，譬如：初下田做活那几天，有些队员在为工分闹意见；三个小组长，有两个在评分时总是先把自己的分评高一些，另一个组长虽不当面争分，但总觉得自己分挣少了，夜里觉都睡不着。对这些问题，他们就及时检讨出来，当作教育队员的材料。五队的队员进行自我教育方式还很多：他们定期读报，总结生产，开检讨会。有些老太婆入社不过两三个月，也懂得自我批评了。他们在思想教育上花了很大功夫，因此，队员们对合作社热情高，劲头大，说声要往田里下硝泥，大家就争着把自己的土砖拿出来，去拆换墙脚；合作社要盖房子，人人争着报名出工。他们队上的庄稼，该淋粪就淋，该浇水就浇，就像娘带孩子那样，不让饿着，不让渴着，这样庄稼怎么能长得不好呢？
    现在，合作社的领导干部正在加强对三队的领导，帮助三队作务的大春作物能够赶上前去。
