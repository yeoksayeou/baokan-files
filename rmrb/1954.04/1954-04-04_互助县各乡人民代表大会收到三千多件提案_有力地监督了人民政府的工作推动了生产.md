Editor's Note: The People's Congresses of townships in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, received over 3,000 proposals. The content is rich and broad, the criticism is sharp and profound, fully demonstrating the spirit of the people as masters of the country, fully demonstrating the high level of political and production enthusiasm of the people, and also proving that in the election campaign in various townships, democracy was more fully promoted in the process of representatives collecting proposals. At present, many regions are actively preparing to convene people's congresses. Before the congress is convened, all localities should take Huzhu County, Qinghai as an example, fully promote democracy, actively assist representatives in mobilizing the masses, do a good job in collecting proposals, and check the implementation of various policies based on the people's proposals, check the work of the government and the style of cadres, and then improve the work based on the criticism and suggestions of the masses. Only in this way can the people's congress be held vigorously and achieve good results.

In the grassroots election work, Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, fully promoted democracy, checked the work of the government and the style of cadres, and improved the political and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Before the convening of the township people's congresses, the voters of all ethnic groups in the county's thirty-two townships, with the attitude of masters of the country, earnestly and responsibly put forward a total of more than three thousand eight hundred and fifty proposals related to production and construction, truly exerting the supervisory role of the people over the government, thereby powerfully promoting the government's various tasks, especially production work.

Among the more than three thousand eight hundred proposals, the people of various townships put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the development of mutual aid and cooperation movements. For example, the proposal of Lian Da Township pointed out that the township people's government did not provide enough leadership in the evaluation of work and scoring of mutual aid groups, and requested that leadership be strengthened for mutual aid groups in the future to help solve difficulties in order to consolidate and improve mutual aid groups. The proposal of Shangzhai Township criticized that a staff member of the county people's government lived in Shangzhai for nearly two months, only working in one mutual aid group, and completely ignored other mutual aid groups and agricultural production. Many proposals criticized the people's government in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement as "tight in spring and not asked in autumn, reorganized again next year."

In their proposals, the people of various townships checked the work of supply and marketing cooperatives. Townships without supply and marketing cooperatives reported that they were still exploited by private merchants, that it was inconvenient to go to supply and marketing cooperatives in other townships because of the long distance, and that they suffered too much from buying goods from "peddlers." Townships that already had cooperatives reported that there were few members, little funds, and not many commodities, which could not fully meet the needs of the people, and requested to mobilize the masses to buy shares and expand funds. The proposal of Zelin Township criticized the cooperative: "No member meeting has been held, and the cooperative's policies have not been publicized to the masses. Therefore, ordinary women do not understand the benefits of the cooperative and still often trade with hawkers, suffering from intermediate exploitation." The proposals of Thirteen townships, including Sanqi and Lian Da, all proposed that the cooperative should fully supply production tools such as iron shovels, wooden shovels, back baskets, and hammer handles in the future to ensure the needs of production. Some township proposals also suggested that the cooperative sell fewer consumer goods such as granulated sugar and supply more production tools; and that the cooperative staff be required to carry goods to the countryside during the busy farming season.

Many proposals exposed and criticized the bureaucratic style in the agricultural leadership system. For example, some criticized the work of the local state-owned Heping Township Farm as "insufficient contact with the masses, little guidance to production, and no demonstration effect." It criticized the farm staff for not knowing how to closely contact the local people, especially for not combining their work with the local mutual aid and cooperation movement; and the work of promoting improved varieties was not very effective. At the same time, the masses also revealed that the farm did not take good care of livestock and farm implements, and criticized the farm for delaying the harvest time, causing more than 2,000 kilograms of improved varieties to be blown to the ground by the wind. In their proposals, the people of various townships also criticized the cadres of the local state-owned Heping Water Conservancy Management Office for not respecting the opinions of the masses, delaying the watering time, claiming to be technicians, and not accepting the local administrative leadership, saying that they only did their own work, managed the large canals, and were unwilling to do a little more that was related to the vital interests of the people even though they had nothing to do. The masses reflected that these cadres did not work for more than half the year. The people of Shangzhai Township criticized that "the county promotion station did not understand the situation and promoted new-style plows to the hilly areas of Lianhe Township, which could not be used and became chicken coops." At the same time, they criticized that "two comrades sent by the provincial promotion station to promote new-style farm implements lived in Dajiazhuang for more than a month and did not teach the masses how to use them at all, never leaving the house and only sleeping every day." The masses reflected: "These two comrades are like 'sitting the month' (women resting after childbirth), only guarding the house and watching the door!" The proposal of Shuangshu Township said that a comrade sent by the county promotion station to Shizi Village to promote new-style farm implements "only knows how to talk, but doesn't know how to use them," and the masses wanted him to "go back and learn it before coming again."

In terms of the production of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the people of various townships put forward many beneficial criticisms and suggestions. For example, the proposal of Lian Da Township requested: "Organize rural cadres and activists to learn agricultural production knowledge, improve farming techniques, and working methods during slack farming season, so as to lead the masses in production." Many proposals also requested to develop more turn-head plows suitable for small plots and mountainous areas in the future. Some township people requested to supply more improved varieties suitable for local planting, such as Biyu wheat. Regarding seed dressing with pesticides, the masses criticized: "The dressing last year was too late, it was a 'post-mortem' job"; and requested that in the future, not only people in the plains should use pesticide dressing, but also people in the mountains, and so on. In forest areas, the current widespread and serious problem is that forestry protection work is too poor. Various townships reported that shepherds grazed sheep and scattered livestock entered the forest at will, and individual cadres cut down trees privately to build houses. The general opinion on closing mountains for forest protection is that it is "closed to death," so that even the wooden shovels and hoe handles needed for production have become difficult to obtain. In pastoral areas, the people's proposals in various townships requested to strengthen the work of breeding stations and to increase livestock with strong physiques. The Tibetan and Tu people of Songduo, Lian Da, and other townships close to pastoral areas "requested to give livestock more vaccinations and strengthen the organization of wolf fighting to reduce livestock casualties and protect livestock health." Some township people also proposed to implement zonal rotational grazing and consolidate the grassland management system to solve the difficulty of livestock grazing.

Many townships proposed: "Request the government to attach importance to the work of reforming lazy people in order to strengthen the strength of production," and criticized the government for having inappropriate places in issuing relief funds. For example, the proposal of Lian Da Township said: "Relief is given to lazy people, making them rely on the government for a living."

In addition, there are also some proposals on transportation, credit loans, as well as cultural, educational, health, and women's work. Among them, there are two hundred and forty-one items related to repairing bridges and roads, accounting for about 6.3 percent of the total number of proposals. Many township proposals reflect that the loans have not been subject to democratic evaluation, and are monopolized by a few selfish cadres, and have not been used for households with real production difficulties, and some people even use the name of engaging in sideline occupations to actually engage in commerce, speculation, and profiteering with loans, or lending at usurious rates. For example, the people's proposal in Dongshan Township criticized that "the cooperative's credit loans should not be lent to horse traders to resell livestock and exploit people, but should be lent to farmers to develop agricultural production." Some proposals proposed that there were few schools and requested to send more teachers. Doctors do not often go to the countryside, especially there are few maternity stations, and they requested to set up more medical clinics and train more new-method midwives. Many women representatives criticized that the Marriage Law was not implemented enough. Regarding the work of the people's court, the masses reflected that "problems are not handled carefully." The proposals of Huaixin, Taiyuan, and other townships said: "We must publicize the marriage policy very well. Some men casually beat and scold women, and women stay in their parents' home and do not return, affecting production."

The local party and government attached great importance to the three thousand eight hundred and fifty proposals put forward by the people of various townships, and are prepared to gradually solve them according to needs and possibilities. Zhang Guosheng, a member of the Provincial Election Committee, personally collected and studied opinions from all aspects of the masses and carefully handled them. Through these proposals, not only has the style of cadres been changed, and the government has been able to further specifically understand the vital requirements of the broad masses of all ethnic groups, but also the improvement of the work of various work departments has played a practical and powerful promotion and supervision role, thus further strengthening the connection between the government and the people.

    互助县各乡人民代表大会收到三千多件提案
    有力地监督了人民政府的工作推动了生产
    编者按：青海省互助县各乡人民代表大会收到三千多件提案，内容很丰富广泛，批评很尖锐深刻，充分显示了人民群众的国家主人翁气概，充分显示了人民群众政治积极性和生产积极性的高涨，同时也证明各乡在普选运动中，在代表收集提案过程中，比较充分地发扬了民主。目前许多地区正积极准备召开人民代表大会。在大会召开之前，各地应该以青海互助县为榜样，充分发扬民主，积极协助代表发动群众，作好收集提案的工作，并根据人民的提案来检查各种政策的执行情况，检查政府的工作和干部作风，进而根据群众的批评和建议来改进工作。只有这样，才能使人民代表大会开得生气勃勃，收到良好的成果。    
    青海省互助县在基层选举工作中，充分地发扬了民主，检查了政府工作和干部作风，提高了广大人民的政治积极性和生产积极性。在召开乡人民代表大会之前，全县三十二个乡各民族的选民都以国家主人翁的态度，认真负责地提出了有关生产建设工作等方面的提案共三千八百五十多件，真正发挥了人民对政府的监督作用，从而有力地推动了政府的各项工作特别是生产工作。
    在三千八百多件提案中，各乡人民对发展互助合作运动方面提出了许多批评和建议。如连大乡提案中指出，乡人民政府对互助组的评工和记分领导不够，要求今后对互助组加强领导，帮助解决困难，以巩固提高互助组。上寨乡提案中批评县人民政府有个工作人员在上寨住了近两个月，只在一个互助组里做工作，对其他互助组及农业生产完全不管。许多提案中对人民政府在领导互助合作运动工作上的批评是“春紧秋不问，来年再整顿”。
    各乡人民在提案中对供销合作社的工作作了检查。没有设立供销合作社的乡，人民提出他们仍受私商剥削，到别的乡供销合作社路远不便，向“货郎担”买货吃亏太大。已有了合作社的乡，人民提出社员少，资金少，商品不多，不能充分满足人民的需要，要求发动群众入股，扩大资金。泽林乡的提案中批评合作社：“没召开过社员大会，没向群众宣传过合作社的政策，因而一般妇女不明白合作社的好处，仍经常和小贩交易，受到中间剥削。”三其、连大等十三个乡的提案中，都提出合作社今后要充分供应铁锨、木锨、背斗、鎯头把等生产工具，以保证生产的需要。有些乡的提案中还建议合作社少卖砂糖等消费品，多供应一些生产工具；农忙时要求合作社工作人员背货下乡。
    许多提案中，揭发和批评了农业领导系统中的官僚主义作风。如有的批评地方国营的和平乡农场工作是“联系群众不够，对生产指导作用不大，没起到示范作用”。批评农场工作人员不懂得密切联系当地人民，特别是没有把自己的工作和当地的互助合作运动结合起来；推广优良品种的工作效果不大。同时群众还揭发了农场不爱护牲畜和农具，批评农场因为耽误收割时间，使两千多斤优良品种被风刮到地上的错误。各乡人民提案中对地方国营的和平水利管理处干部不尊重群众意见、误了浇水时间，自称技术人员，不接受当地行政领导等缺点和错误，也提出了批评，说他们只做分内的事，管大水渠，虽然闲着没事做，也不愿多做一点关系人民切身利益的事。群众反映这些干部一年有大半时间不做事。上寨乡的人民批评“县推广站不了解情况，给联合乡山地推广了新式步犁，用不成，当了鸡架”。同时批评“省推广站派来两个同志推广新式农具，在达家庄住了一个多月，根本不教给群众使用方法，每天不出门，只睡觉。”群众反映：“这两个同志就像是‘坐月子’（妇女产后休息时间），只守家看门！”双树乡的提案中说：县推广站派到十字村推广新式农具的一位同志“只会说，不会用”，群众要他“回去学会了再来”。
    在农业、林业、牧畜业的生产方面，各乡人民都提出了许多有益的批评和建议。如连大乡提案中要求：“农闲时组织农村干部和积极分子学习农业生产知识，改良耕作技术和工作方法，以便领导群众生产。”许多提案中还要求今后多发展那种适于小块地和山地的转头犁。有些乡的人民要求多供应适于当地种植的碧玉麦等优良品种。对于药剂拌种，群众批评：“去年拌的迟了，成了‘马后炮’”；要求今后不仅给川地人民用药拌种，也要给山地人民拌种，等等。在林区，目前普遍而严重的问题是护林工作太差。各乡反映：牧童放羊和零散牲畜随便进树林，个别干部为造房屋私自砍了林木。在封山护林方面的普遍意见是“封死了”，以致生产上需要的木锨、镢头把等都发生了困难。在牧区，各乡人民提案中要求加强配种站工作和要求增加体格健壮的牲畜的意见颇多。接近牧区的松多、连大等乡的藏族和土族人民“要求多给牲畜打防疫针，加强打狼的组织，以减少牲畜伤亡，保护牲畜健康”。有些乡的人民还提出了实行分区轮牧，巩固草原管理制度，以解决牲畜吃草的困难等建议。
    不少乡提出：“要求政府重视改造懒汉的工作，以加强生产的力量”，并批评政府发放救济款有不适当处。如连大乡提案中说：“救济了懒汉，使他们专靠政府过活。”
    此外，还有些关于交通运输、信用贷款以及文教、卫生和妇女工作等方面的提案。其中属于修桥补路的有二百四十一件，约占提案总数的百分之六点三。有不少乡的提案中反映：贷款没有经过民主评议，被少数自私自利的干部包办，没有用到真正生产困难户身上，甚至有人以搞副业为名，实际上是用贷款搞商业，投机倒把，或放高利贷。如东山乡人民提案中批评“合作社信用贷款不应该贷给马贩子倒卖牲口剥削人，应贷给农民发展农业生产”。有的提案提出学校少，并要求多派教员。医生不常下乡，特别是接生站少，要求多设医疗所，多训练新法接生员。不少妇女代表批评婚姻法贯彻得不够。对人民法院工作，群众反映“处理问题不慎重”。淮新、太源等乡提案中说：“要把婚姻政策很好地宣传一下，有的男人随便打骂女人，妇女住娘家不回来，影响生产。”
    对于各乡人民提出的三千八百五十多件提案，当地的党和政府极为重视，并准备根据需要与可能，逐步地加以解决。该省选举委员会委员张国声并亲自搜集研究了来自群众中的各方面意见，认真地做了处理。通过这些提案，不但促使干部作风有所改变，使政府更进一步具体地了解到各族广大人民的切身要求，而且对各个工作部门工作的改进也起了实际有力的推动和监督作用，因而也就更加密切了政府与人民群众的联系。
