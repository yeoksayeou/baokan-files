Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has established the policy of "restoring and developing commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." For more than four years, our country has been restoring and developing its foreign trade in accordance with this policy.

Since 1950, China's foreign trade has changed the situation of import surplus that lasted for seventy-three years during the reactionary rule; in recent years, imports and exports have been basically balanced. Compared with 1949, the total value of foreign trade in 1953 increased more than five times, and greatly exceeded the highest level before the war, fully demonstrating the enormous potential of China's foreign trade.

The continuous growth of China's foreign trade is a heavy blow to the U.S. ruling clique's hostile measures of "blockade" and "embargo" against China. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out as early as October 1951: "The ignorant American imperialists thought that 'blockade' and 'embargo' would surely deal a heavy blow to our country, but they were completely wrong. The imperialists' 'blockade' and 'embargo' are precisely used by us to eliminate the semi-colonial dependence in China's economy, shorten the process of our achieving complete economic independence and autonomy, and those who are truly hit are themselves."

One of the main reasons why China's foreign trade has been able to break the "blockade" and "embargo" of U.S. imperialism and achieve great success is that China has established and developed close economic cooperation with the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. For example, if the total value of China's trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 255 in 1951, 312 in 1952, and 409 in 1953. In 1950, the total value of China's trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries accounted for only 26 percent of China's total foreign trade, increasing to 75 percent in 1953.

The development of China's trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has greatly helped China's economic recovery and production development, and has great significance for China's first five-year plan economic construction that began last year. In recent years, China has imported a large number of various metallurgical, mining, machine manufacturing, chemical, power and other equipment, as well as various industrial materials, automobiles, agricultural machinery, construction machinery, steel, non-ferrous metal materials, petroleum products, chemical products and other important materials needed for economic construction from the Soviet Union through foreign trade. The new construction or reconstruction of many factories, mines and other enterprises in China has received huge selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in technology and equipment. For example, China's first mechanized and automated seamless steel pipe plant, the first mechanized and automated large-scale rolling steel plant and the No. 7 automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the large-scale Fuxin open-pit coal mine, and China's first modern automated flax factory—Harbin Flax Factory—were all built with the supply of Soviet equipment and with the help of Soviet experts. In 1953, China also imported a considerable amount of important materials such as machine tools, power machines, drilling machines, cranes, construction machinery and vehicles from six European people's democratic countries such as Poland, Democratic Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. At the same time, China also supplied various important mineral products and soybeans, peanuts, vegetable oil, oilseeds, meat, tobacco, fruits, wool, raw silk, silk fabrics, leather and other materials according to the needs of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The export of these products to the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has guaranteed a reliable and broad market for China's agricultural and sideline products, and has played a considerable role in promoting the development of agricultural and sideline production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

While developing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, China has also made unremitting efforts to restore and develop trade relations with various countries in the capitalist world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In 1950, the total value of China's trade with various countries in the capitalist world greatly exceeded that of 1936, the year before the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the U.S.'s "blockade" and "embargo" policy, this trade volume slightly decreased in 1951. However, this did not prevent the continuous development of China's economy, but caused serious damage to the economies and people's lives of various countries in the capitalist world. During the Moscow International Economic Conference in 1952, the Chinese delegation signed trade agreements with business representatives from eleven countries including Britain, France, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ceylon, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Italy, totaling US$224 million. The economic representatives of China and Japan participating in the Moscow Economic Conference signed a Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Beijing with a total import and export value of 60 million pounds. In the same year, China and Ceylon also signed a five-year trade agreement on rubber and rice, and in the second half of the same year, they signed a triangular trade agreement with the Soviet Union and Finland.

China's trade relations with various countries in the capitalist world had a significant restoration and development in 1953, with a 29 percent increase in trade volume compared with 1952, which not only conforms to the economic interests of the people of the world, but also helps to ease international tensions. In June and July 1953, the China National Import and Export Corporation signed a trade agreement in Beijing with the French industrial and commercial trade delegation with a total trade amount of 10 million pounds each for both parties (payable in French francs), and signed a commercial agreement with the British industrial and commercial delegation visiting China with 15 million pounds each for each party. In October of the same year, the trade delegations of the Central People's Government of China and the Government of Ceylon signed two contracts in Beijing for the purchase and sale of rice and rubber in 1954, and the two parties agreed to extend the trade agreement concluded in October 1952 for two years. In October of the same year, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the delegation of the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade" of Japan signed a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement on the basis of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed on June 1, 1952, with a total trade amount of 30 million pounds each for the purchase and sale of goods by each party. Last November, China and Indonesia signed a trade agreement, and recently they signed a trade agreement with Burma. These agreements show that despite the embargo obstruction of U.S. imperialism, trade between China and various countries in the capitalist world has continued to develop on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The signing of all the above agreements and contracts reflects the urgent demands of the people of all countries for improving and expanding normal international trade relations, especially for restoring and developing trade relations with China. It also proves that China's foreign trade policy of equality and mutual benefit not only conforms to the requirements of China's economic development, but also conforms to the vital interests and wishes of millions of people all over the world. However, due to the fact that the governments of some countries disregard the interests and wishes of their own people and follow the U.S.'s "blockade" and "embargo" policy, many of the above agreements and contracts have not been fully realized smoothly, and the development of normal international trade has been damaged. These countries that follow the policies of the U.S. government have encountered increasing difficulties. If all man-made obstacles hindering the development of normal international trade are removed, and if some countries do not succumb to the U.S.'s "embargo" policy, China's trade with various countries in the capitalist world would have greater development.

It is well known that China is a country with huge export potential. We are one of the world's major silk suppliers, the export of Chinese tea has a long history, China's bristle supply accounts for three-quarters of the world's needs, and China's exports of eggs and egg products often rank first in the world. There are many other materials available for export. With the development of China's production, the output of these export materials will inevitably increase day by day. In 1953, China's export volume of mineral products had increased three and a half times compared with 1950.

On the other hand, China, with a population of more than 500 million, is carrying out large-scale industrialization construction, and the first five-year plan has begun last year; at the same time, the purchasing power of the Chinese people is also increasing day by day, so China's import needs, whether in terms of means of production or means of subsistence, will inevitably increase day by day. It can be seen that China has very good objective conditions for developing normal trade relations with various countries. We are still willing, as in the past, to restore and develop commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Now it depends on whether the capitalist countries are prepared to implement trade policies that conform to their own national interests, and whether they are willing to work together to restore and develop mutual trade relations.

    中国对外贸易的恢复和发展
    叶周
    中华人民共和国自成立之日起，就确定了“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”的方针。四年多以来，我国就是本着这一方针，恢复和发展了我国的对外贸易。
    从一九五○年起，我国对外贸易就改变了在反动统治时期的七十三年的入超情况；几年来进出口基本上都是平衡的。和一九四九年相比，一九五三年对外贸易总值增加了五倍多，并大大地超过了战前的最高水平，充分显示着我国对外贸易的巨大可能性。
      我国对外贸易不断的增长，对美国统治集团对我国所采取的“封锁”“禁运”的敌对措施，是一个沉重的打击。周恩来总理早在一九五一年十月就曾指出：“愚昧无知的美帝国主义者满以为‘封锁’和‘禁运’一定能给我国以沉重打击，但是他们完全错了。帝国主义者的‘封锁’和‘禁运’，正好被我们用以肃清在中国经济中的半殖民地的依赖性，缩短我们在经济上获取完全独立自主的过程，而真正受到打击的，反而是他们自己。”
    我国对外贸易所以能打破美帝国主义的“封锁”“禁运”而取得巨大的成就，主要原因之一就在于我国和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国建立和发展了密切的经济合作关系。如以一九五○年我国对苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易总值为一百，则一九五一年为二五五，一九五二年为三一二，一九五三年为四○九。在一九五○年我国对苏联与各人民民主国家贸易总值只占我国对外贸易总额的百分之二十六，一九五三年增至百分之七十五。
    我国对苏联和人民民主国家贸易的发展，大大地帮助了我国经济恢复和生产的发展，并对我国去年开始的第一个五年计划经济建设有重大的意义。几年来，我国通过对外贸易从苏联输入了大量经济建设上所必需的各种冶金、采掘、机器制造、化工、电力等设备以及各种工业器材、汽车、农业机器、建筑机器、钢材、有色金属材料、石油产品、化学产品等重要物资。我国许多工厂、矿山及其他企业的新建或改建，获得苏联技术与设备上的巨大的无私帮助，例如我国第一座机械化自动化的无缝钢管厂、第一座机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂和鞍山炼铁厂第七号自动化炼铁炉、规模宏大的阜新露天煤矿、我国第一个现代化自动化的亚麻工厂——哈尔滨亚麻厂等，都是获得了苏联的设备供应并在苏联专家帮助下建设起来的。一九五三年我国从波兰、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚等六个欧洲人民民主国家也进口了相当数量的工作母机、动力机、钻探机、起重机、建筑机械及车辆等重要物资。同时我国也根据苏联和各人民民主国家的需要供应了各种重要的矿产品和大豆、花生、植物油、油籽、肉类、烟草、水果、羊毛、生丝、绸缎、皮革等物资。这些产品对苏联和人民民主国家的输出，为我国的农副产品保证了可靠的广阔的市场，对促进农副业生产发展、巩固工农联盟均起了相当大的作用。
    在发展对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易的同时，我国也一贯地对在平等互利的基础上恢复与发展对资本主义世界各国的贸易关系作了不懈的努力。一九五○年我国与资本主义世界各国的贸易总额即大大地超过了抗日战争前的一年，即一九三六年。由于美国的“封锁”“禁运”政策，到一九五一年这种贸易额有稍微的下降。但是这并没有阻止了我国经济的不断发展，而对资本主义世界各国的经济和人民生活却造成了严重的损害。一九五二年莫斯科国际经济会议期间我国代表团曾与英、法、西德、比、荷、瑞士、锡兰、印尼、巴基斯坦、意大利等十一个国家的工商界代表签订了总额达二亿二千四百万美元的贸易协议，我国与日本参加莫斯科经济会议的经济代表在北京签订了双方进出口总值为六千万英镑的中日贸易协议，同年我国与锡兰也签订了关于橡胶和大米的五年贸易协定，在同年下半年又和苏联、芬兰签订了三角贸易协定。
    我国和资本主义世界各国的贸易关系，在一九五三年中又有了显著的恢复与发展，贸易额比一九五二年增加百分之二十九，这不仅符合世界人民的经济利益，并有助于缓和国际紧张局势。一九五三年六、七月间，中国进出口公司与法国工商业贸易代表团在北京签订了贸易总金额双方各出口一千万英镑（用法郎支付）的贸易协定，与英国工商界访华代表团签订了每方各出口一千五百万英镑的商业协议。同年十月，我中央人民政府和锡兰政府贸易代表团在北京签订了一九五四年买卖大米和橡胶的两项合同，双方并同意将一九五二年十月缔结的贸易协定延长两年。同年十月，中国国际贸易促进委员会和日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团以一九五二年六月一日签订的中日贸易协议为基础，签订了一项贸易总金额为每方购入与售出各为价值三千万英镑货物的新的中日贸易协议。去年十一月，我国和印度尼西亚签订了贸易协定，最近又和缅甸签订了贸易协定。这些协定说明尽管有美帝国主义的禁运阻挠，但在平等互利的基础上我国与资本主义世界各国之间的贸易仍不断地有了发展。
    以上一切协议和合同的签订，反映了各国人民对于改善与扩大正常的国际贸易关系，特别是恢复与发展对中国的贸易关系的迫切要求，同时也证明了我国平等互利的对外贸易政策不但符合我国经济发展的要求，并且也符合全世界千百万人民的切身利益和愿望。但由于某些国家的政府不顾本国人民的利益与愿望，追随美国的“封锁”“禁运”政策，使得上述许多协议和合同未能顺利地全部实现，使国际正常贸易的开展受到了损害，而这些追随美国政府政策的国家已遭到日益增大的困难。如果铲除阻碍国际正常贸易发展的一切人为障碍，如果不是有些国家屈服于美国的“禁运”政策的话，我国对资本主义世界各国的贸易是会有更大发展的。
    人所共知，中国是一个具有巨大输出潜能的国家。我们是世界上主要丝绸供应国之一，中国茶叶的输出已有悠久的历史，中国的猪鬃供应了世界需要量的四分之三，中国鸡蛋和蛋品的输出经常占着世界的第一位，其他可供出口的物资还有很多。随着我国生产的发展，这些出口物资的产量必然日益增大。一九五三年我国矿产品的出口量就已比一九五○年增加了三倍半。
    另一方面，拥有五亿多人口的中国，正在进行大规模工业化建设，第一个五年计划已于去年开始实行；同时我国人民的购买力也正日益提高，因此我国进口的需要无论是在生产资料或生活资料方面都必然日益增多。可见，我国有着与各国发展正常贸易关系的很好的客观条件。我们今后仍然和过去一样愿意在平等互利的基础上，与各国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系。现在就要看各资本主义国家是否准备执行符合自己民族利益的贸易政策，愿不愿意共同努力恢复和发展相互的贸易关系了。
