    For a Common Aspiration
  　By Our Correspondent Shen Shi
    The people in the production technology office say he is an internal combustion engine fitter. The people in the team say he is a crane driver. Regardless of whether he is an internal combustion engine fitter or a crane driver, he is now managing a rock drill (workers call the air compressor a rock drill).

    He is from the Machinery Rental Station. After the Rental Station signed a contact contract with the Tunnel Engineering Team, he and many companions went to the Wushaoling Tunnel Engineering Team.

    He hasn't been here long, but if you ask the workers of the Second Detachment of the Tunnel Team, they will definitely tell you:
    "Sun Kuifu? He has been a great help to our tunnel!"
    "You're asking about Old Sun? He is really an outstanding rock drill manager."

    Comrades encouraged him, the detachment rewarded him, and when the pilot tunnel was being excavated, people wrote letters to thank him. Sun Kuifu has become the most popular person in the Second Detachment of the Tunnel Engineering Team.

    He and his two companions live on the hillside near the east entrance of the tunnel. Each of them takes turns working eight hours a day.

    Those who manage rock drills always get machine oil on themselves. Sun Kuifu is, of course, no exception. In addition to the accumulated black oil stains, his clothes are sometimes covered with patches of brown mud.

    The mud on his clothes is a sign of Sun Kuifu's popularity among the workers. It tells people how closely he is integrated with the workers in the tunnel, which is what sets him apart from other rock drill operators.

    According to the usual saying, those who manage rock drills only need to keep the machine running normally, without accidents, and as long as they send a certain amount of air to the tunnel, no one can say anything. However, Sun Kuifu is not like that.

    On the high mountains, every day he walks out of that machine room, sees the rolling mountains, and cannot help but think: quickly break through the Wushaoling Tunnel and let the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway be built westward.

    When Sun Kuifu first came to Wushaoling, he managed the machine for eight hours a day as usual. As time went on, he felt that he knew very little about the situation in the tunnel. Did the workers have any opinions on the operation of the rock drill? What was the progress of the tunnel... These kinds of questions made him uneasy. He thought: should those who manage rock drills only be limited to eight hours of work a day and not care about the workers? As a Communist Party member, should he be content with the status quo and stay away from the tunnel? No, he can't do that, he can't stay in the machine room all the time, he must go into the tunnel often.

    He constantly contacted the workers and learned about some of the situations in the tunnel: the workers could not repair the rock drills, and if the rock drills broke down, work would stop; each rock drill was equipped with four pneumatic drills, and the progress was slow during excavation; the rock drills often encountered hard rocks; the raincoats worn by the workers were always soaked by the groundwater. These situations aroused his deep concern for the tunnel workers. He thought: can these problems in the tunnel be ignored? If the rock drill is broken, can't I repair it? Can't the rock drill I'm managing carry a few more pneumatic drills? The machine room is warm, can't the workers dry their raincoats? Thinking of this, his sense of responsibility for the construction of the motherland surged up in his heart.

    Old Sun went to Comrade Cao Enxu, the foreman of the detachment, and said to him: "Old Cao! The workers' raincoats are often soaked, and sometimes even their cotton clothes are wet. Can they be dried in my machine room?"

    "As long as it doesn't interfere with your work, I certainly hope everyone can wear dry clothes," Foreman Cao replied.

    "It won't interfere with the work, please tell them to come and dry their raincoats every day," Old Sun said.

    From then on, the workers of the Second Detachment of the Tunnel Team no longer had to go down the tunnel wearing wet raincoats every day.

    Old Sun also often brought an oil can and repair tools to the tunnel to help the workers repair rock drills and pneumatic drills.

    In his conversations with the workers, Sun Kuifu learned that they hoped the rock drill could carry one or two more pneumatic drills to speed up the progress of excavating the pilot tunnel. Old Sun ran to the detachment and said to Deputy Captain Zi Yaorong: "Captain Zi! Can my rock drill carry one or two more pneumatic drills?" "Old Sun! Will carrying more pneumatic drills damage the machine? Think about it carefully!" Captain Zi replied.

    "I've thought about it many times. As long as we maintain the machine well, carrying one or two more pneumatic drills won't damage the machine," Old Sun said confidently.

    "As long as the machine is not affected, try carrying one first!" Captain Zi said.

    After that, the rock drill at the east entrance carried one more pneumatic drill. Some of his companions who came with him from the Rental Station said: "Old Sun! Your rock drill is carrying more pneumatic drills, and it runs an average of twenty-two hours a day, burning fifty-three kilograms of diesel oil every eight hours. Do you know how much a kilogram of diesel oil is worth!"

    "Comrade!" Old Sun replied, "It seems that my rock drill burns more diesel oil, but think about it: if the tunnel is broken through one day earlier, and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is opened to traffic one day earlier, how much benefit will it bring to the country? Not to mention the distant future, just think about the tunnel team. If more than three thousand workers stay in Wushaoling for one more day, how much money will it cost!"

    "Aren't you considering that the rock drill might be damaged?" the person asked again.

    "I've already considered it. We will take care of the machine as if we were protecting our own eyes," Old Sun said.

    Sun Kuifu really lived up to his words. Although he was managing an old rock drill, after carrying one more pneumatic drill, he and his two companions managed it with extra care. From October of last year to February of this year, it has been running for more than three thousand two hundred hours without any major obstacles.

    Anyone familiar with Sun Kuifu knows that he loves machines very much. During the Liberation War, he drove cars in the army, and the cars rarely had accidents. Later, he participated in the construction of the Baoji-Tianshui and Tianshui-Lanzhou Railways, and the machines he managed were always well maintained.

    In 1952, he worked in the Beidaobu Machinery Depot on the Tianshui-Lanzhou line, and the person in charge of the machinery depot was Xu Junchen, the current vice chairman of the trade union of the Machinery Rental Station. Once, the cylinder of the crane was frozen and cracked. Old Sun said to Xu Junchen: "The accident on the crane should attract your attention!" Xu Junchen didn't take his words to heart. Who knew that the next day, Xia Sunding, the deputy director of the Machinery Department, and Zhu Shitang, the political commissar, called him in and asked: "Old Xu! Did you know about the accident?"

    "What accident? Tell me!" Xu Junchen said.

    "The cylinder of the crane was frozen and cracked, and it didn't attract your attention."

    Later, when Xu Junchen saw Sun Kuifu, he asked: "Old Sun! Did you tell Director Xia about the accident on the crane?"

    "I reported it. I told you, but you didn't pay attention to it, so of course I brought it up to Director Xia and Political Commissar Zhu," Old Sun said.

    The Machinery Department conducted a major accident inspection through this incident and discovered some problems in the work. Since then, Xu Junchen further understood what kind of person Old Sun was, and instead became better with him.

    Sun Kuifu, this ordinary worker, thought so deeply and saw so far for the sake of the collective cause and for a common aspiration. Although he didn't do anything earth-shattering, he used his actions at all times to speed up the time for tunneling and to increase the strength of construction for the motherland.

    为了共同的愿望
  　本报记者　沈石
    生产技术室的人说，他是内燃机钳工。分队的人说，他是吊车司机。不管他是内燃机钳工，或者是吊车司机，他现在管理着一台开山机（工人叫空气压缩机做开山机）。
    他是机械经租站的人，经租站和隧道工程队订过联系合同以后，他和许多同伴，到了乌鞘岭隧道工程队。
    他来的时间并不长，可是你去问隧道队二分队的工人，他们一定会告诉你：
    “孙魁福吗？他对我们隧道的帮助可大哩！”
    “你问老孙吗？他真是个出色的管理开山机的人。”
    同志们鼓舞过他，分队奖励过他，开凿隧道的导坑时，人们写信感谢过他。孙魁福成了隧道工程队第二分队最受欢迎的人了。
    他和他的两个同伴，住在隧道东口附近的山坡上。他们每天每人轮流值班八小时。
    管理开山机的人，身上总免不了机器油。孙魁福，当然不会例外，他那套衣服，除了日积月累的漆黑的油垢，有时还沾上一块一块的褐色的泥浆。
    衣服上的泥浆，这是孙魁福受到工人欢迎的标志，这告诉人们：他是怎样和隧道里的工人紧紧地结合在一起，这就是他不同于其他照管开山机的人的地方。
    按通常的说法，管理开山机的人，只要开山机运转正常，不发生事故，只要向隧道压送一定的风量，别人是没话可说的。可是，孙魁福不是这样。
    他在高山上，每天走出那间机器房，看到绵延起伏的山峦，就情不自禁地想到：赶快打通乌鞘岭大隧道，让兰新铁路向西修去。
    孙魁福刚来乌鞘岭的时候，每天照例管理机器八个钟头，日子久了，他感到隧道里的情形，自己很少知道。工人对开山机的运转有没有意见？隧道的进度怎样……这类问题引起他的不安。他想：照管开山机的，难道每天只限于八小时的工作，不去关心工人吗？一个共产党员，难道只满足现状，将自己高搁在隧道以外吗？不，不能这样，不能老守在机器房里，必须经常到洞子里去。
    他和工人不断地接触，明白了隧道里的一些情况：工人们不会修理风镐，风镐发生故障，工作便停下来；每台开山机，带四具风镐，开凿时，进度慢；风镐经常碰到坚硬的岩石；工人们穿的雨衣，总是被地下水淋得透湿。这些情形，激起了他对隧道工人深切的关怀。他想：隧道里有了这些问题，难道可以袖手旁观吗？风镐坏了，难道我不能修理吗？我管的那台开山机，难道不能多带几具风镐吗？机器房很暖，难道不能让工人们烘干雨衣吗？想到这些，他对祖国建设的责任感不由得涌上心来。
    老孙去找分队的领工员曹恩序同志，对他说：“老曹！工人们的雨衣，经常湿透了，有时连棉衣也湿了，可不可以到我那间机器房里去烘干？”
    “只要不妨碍你们的工作，我当然希望大家能够穿干的衣服。”曹领工员回答他。
    “不会妨碍工作的，请你告诉他们，叫他们每天来烘干雨衣吧。”老孙说。
    从此以后，隧道队二分队的工人，每天不用穿湿的雨衣下洞子了。
    老孙又经常带着机油壶和修理工具，下到洞子里，帮助工人修理风镐和风钻。
    孙魁福和工人交谈中，知道他们希望开山机多带一、两具风镐，来加速开凿导坑的进度。老孙跑到分队，对副分队长訾耀荣同志说：“訾队长！我那台开山机，可不可以多带一、两具风镐？”“老孙！多带风镐，会不会损坏机器，你好好考虑吧！”訾队长回答他。
    “我考虑过多少次了，只要我们把机器保养好，多带一、两具风镐，不会损坏机器的。”老孙满有信心地说。
    “只要机器不受影响，你们先带一具试试吧！”訾队长说。
    以后，东洞口那台开山机，多带了一具风镐。和他一道从经租站来的同伴中，有的说：“老孙！你们那台开山机，多带了风镐，每天平均运转二十二小时，每八小时烧五十三公斤柴油，一公斤柴油，你知道值多少钱！”
    “同志！”老孙回答说，“看起来我那台开山机，烧的柴油多，可是，你想一想：隧道提早一天打通，兰新路提早一天通车，对国家有多大好处，远的不说，只提一提隧道队，三千多工人，在乌鞘岭多待一天，花多少钱！”
    “你难道不考虑开山机会受损坏吗？”这人又追问他。
    “我早就考虑过了，我们会像保护自己的眼睛一样来照管机器的。”老孙说。
    孙魁福真的说到做到，他照管的虽是一部旧的开山机，多带一具风镐以后，他和两个同伴，管理得格外小心，从去年十月到今年二月，运转了三千二百多个钟头，没有发生过大的障碍。
    只要熟悉孙魁福的人，都知道他是顶爱护机器的。解放战争时期，他在部队里，驾驶汽车，车子很少出过事故。以后，他参加了修建宝天和天兰铁路，他管理的机器，总是保养得好好的。
    一九五二年，他在天兰线上的北道埠机械库工作，负责机械库的是机械经租站现任工会副主席徐俊臣。有一次，起重机的汽缸冻裂了，老孙对徐俊臣说：“起重机上的事故，应该引起你的注意哩！”徐俊臣没有把他的话放在心上。谁知道，第二天，机械处副处长夏孙丁和政治委员朱时堂把他叫去，问道：“老徐！你是不是知道事故？”
    “什么事故？你们说吧！”徐俊臣说。
    “起重机的汽缸冻裂了，没有引起你的注意。”
    以后，徐俊臣见了孙魁福，问道：“老孙！你向夏处长说过起重机上的事故吗？”
    “是我反映的，我向你说过，你不重视，我当然向夏处长、朱政委提出来。”老孙说。
    机械处通过这桩事情，开展了事故大检查，发现了工作上的一些问题。从此，徐俊臣进一步了解了老孙是一个怎样的人，反倒跟他更好了。
    孙魁福，这位普通的工人，为了集体的事业，为了共同的愿望，他想得多么深入，看得多么远大。虽然他没有做什么惊天动地的事，但是，他随时随地用自己的行动，来提早修通隧道的时间，用自己的行动，给祖国增加建设的力量。
