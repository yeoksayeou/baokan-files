Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 22nd: More than 2,000 representatives of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people of all nationalities and strata from the liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas of Vietnam gathered on the 20th in a certain location in North Vietnam to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the World Peace Movement. All representatives unanimously passed a statement "Supporting the World Peace Movement and Opposing US Imperialism's Increasingly Arrogant Interference in the Indochina War."

The statement said: We are watching with great excitement the deepening and development of the World Peace Movement. The power of the World Peace Movement has forced the warmongers of US imperialism to sign an armistice agreement in Korea, followed by the convocation of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, at which it was agreed to convene the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

However, US imperialism still clings to its "policy of strength," and recently supported the French colonialists with massive amounts of military supplies to continue their war of aggression, and is increasingly arrogantly and directly interfering in the Indochina War.

The statement continued: Under these circumstances, we resolve:

    1. To implement the decision adopted by the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front in early April 1954, and launch a broad movement throughout the country against the increasingly arrogant US interference in the Indochina War and the French warmongers' reliance on the United States to deliberately continue the Indochina war of aggression.
    2. To support the convening of the Geneva Conference.
    3. To support the holding of an international conference in 1954 to discuss easing international tensions.

The statement emphasized: We believe that with the support of the World Peace Movement and under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and peace will surely be victorious. The Vietnamese people vow to join the Khmer, Lao, and all peace-loving people around the world in an unremitting struggle to defend world peace and ease international tensions.

    越南各界集会纪念世界和平运动五周年
    发表声明反对美国蛮横干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社北越二十二日电】越南解放区和敌占区的工人、农民、知识分子以及各民族、各阶层的代表二千多人，二十日在北越某地集会纪念世界和平运动五周年，全体代表一致通过“拥护世界和平运动、反对美帝国主义日益蛮横地干涉印度支那战争”的声明。
    声明说：我们以极兴奋的心情注视着世界和平运动日益深入和发展。世界和平运动的力量已迫使美帝国主义好战分子在朝鲜签订停战协定，随而召开柏林四国外长会议，在这个会议上协议召开日内瓦会议来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平问题。
    可是美帝国主义仍然抱住它的“实力政策”不放，最近以大量军火支持法国殖民者继续进行侵略战争，又日益蛮横地直接干涉印度支那战争。
    声明继续说：处在这种情况下，我们决议：
    一、实现一九五四年四月初越南国民联合战线全国委员会扩大会议所通过的决定，在全国发动一个广泛的反对美国日益蛮横的干涉印度支那战争以及法国好战分子依附美国蓄意继续印度支那侵略战争的运动。
    二、拥护召开日内瓦会议。
    三、赞成在一九五四年间举行一个国际性会议来商讨缓和国际紧张局势的问题。
    声明强调说：我们相信：在世界和平运动的支持下，在胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，越南人民为争取民族独立与和平的斗争一定胜利。越南人民誓和高棉、寮国以及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为保卫世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势而进行不懈的斗争。
