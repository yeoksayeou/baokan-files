    Production Innovator Qin Yisan
    By our reporter Li Ce
    Qin Yisan is a machine lettering worker at the Nan'an Machine Factory in Chongqing. Although he has more than 30 years of work experience, he still humbly learns, diligently studies, and improves his skills. From 1951 to 1953, he made many rationalization proposals. Among the more valuable ones was changing the manual grinding of templates by fitters to machine grinding, and restoring a curve grinder that had been out of service for seven years, solving a key problem in production. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party once called on all machinery factories in the city to promote his production innovation experience. Many workers are now taking Qin Yisan as an example to improve their production.
    In November 1952, on the eve of the start of the country's First Five-Year Plan, the Nan'an Machine Factory began trial-producing new products and re-manufacturing various product templates. In the past, template grinding had always been done manually. Now, with the needs of production, the template production task in the tool workshop had more than doubled, and the fitters had no confidence in completing it. At that time, when Qin Yisan saw this situation, he thought: "Templates are tools for manufacturing new products. If everyone has no confidence in completing this task, how can the trial production of new products succeed? This is the key to the trial production of new products, and we must find a way to complete it." More than half of the template production task in November was "notch templates." He planned to grind "notch templates" on the grinding wheel of the lettering machine. He said to everyone at a meeting:
    “What do you think, will my lettering machine work for grinding 'notch templates'?"
    Most of the fitters were level six or seven master craftsmen, and everyone had their own set of skills. Therefore, they didn't pay much attention to the suggestion of a lettering worker.
    After the meeting, Master Qin returned home, feeling more and more irritated, and complaining that he was meddling in other people's business. After his wife understood the reason for his anger, she said, "The power of the masses is great. If people say it can't be done, it must be impossible. What's the use of you getting angry?" Master Qin lay in bed as if he hadn't heard his wife's words, continuing to think, "Even though I have completed my lettering task, if the team's task is not completed, it will also delay the trial production of new products!" He began to ponder the matter of grinding templates with a grinding wheel again. The next morning, as soon as he went to work, he sought the foreman's opinion. The foreman said, "Go ahead and try it."
    Master Qin found two waste templates, polished them on the grinding wheel of the lettering machine, and sent them to the fitters. A fitter took the polished template and measured it left and right with a steel ruler, saying happily, "It works, the finish is very good." Some people shouted from the side, "See what the tolerance is like?" The tolerance of the template is very important, and the tolerance number cannot exceed one and a half threads. Master Qin asked the fitters for a "notch template" and took it back to grind. He measured it with a steel ruler while grinding. When it was close to the tolerance number, he reduced the speed of the grinding wheel and ground it slowly. Finally, he checked the template and was overjoyed. The tolerance was only half a thread off, and the trial grinding was successful. It was slow at the beginning of grinding, but later, as he became proficient in the operating method, he could grind up to 39 pieces a day at most, and at least 18 pieces, increasing the output by up to 15 times compared to the highest number produced manually.
    In February 1953, when the trial production of new products was nearing completion, the production department needed a large number of type molds again, which were used to stamp the factory name, brand, and date on the new products. Some characters were even smaller than the No. 5 font in the newspaper, and they had to be carved manually on steel. Master Qin sat under the dazzling light every day, wearing a magnifying glass, hunching his back, and carving laboriously. Even a lettering expert like him could only carve four at most in a day, but the comrades who came to collect the type molds kept urging him, saying, "Now we need twelve a day, and when production is in full swing, we will need forty or fifty a day. How can we do it if we carve so slowly!" Master Qin thought to himself: At this rate, I will work myself to death and still not be able to carve enough. In the past, when something like this happened, it would have been simple. He would have slammed the carving knife on the table and said, "I can't do it," and that would have been the end of it. Now he had to think of a way. His apprentice, Zhu Rucai, was not yet proficient in the technique of grinding "notch templates," and he also needed his help. If he didn't think of a way, not only would he not be able to complete the lettering task, but also the template production of the fitters would be affected. Should the factory add a few more lettering workers? That would be the same as not thinking of a way himself. He often pressed his head and pondered.
    One day, he used the old method to check the quality of the carved type molds, pressing a piece of lead onto the carved negative-text type mold with a pressure machine, and the lead immediately showed clear positive-text characters. His mind suddenly cleared, and he thought while holding the lead piece: This is a piece of lead, what if it were a piece of steel? How many type molds could be pressed out if it were used as a master mold! He discussed it with technician Wang Wenguang. Wang Wenguang agreed with his opinion and helped him quench the steel material with the carved type molds, making it very hard. They pressed a piece of non-quenched steel onto it, and the positive-text characters that were pressed out were also very clear. The administration adopted Master Qin's suggestion of using a master mold to press type molds. The production volume of type molds increased fiftyfold. Later, Master Qin made some improvements to the method of pressing type molds, and he was able to complete a month's production task in one hour.
    During the trial production of new products, the lettering machine was contracted to produce "notch templates," and the fitters had time to concentrate their efforts on completing other types of templates. The quantity of templates was sufficient, but "arc templates" were still ground by fitters with files, which was difficult to guarantee quality. Sometimes they were ground round, and sometimes they were ground flat. The arc template is the most difficult type of template to make, with very high precision. In the past, it was also processed manually, and some veteran workers had to wear reading glasses to do this work.
    Now the curve grinder in the workshop can solve this difficult problem, but the factory can't find anyone who knows how to operate it. It has been in the factory for seven years, sleeping there all the time. Last spring, the factory director saw this grinder and said to Qin Yisan, "We should study this problem and put this lathe into use." Soviet experts who came to the factory to visit also said, "The curve grinder is the heart of template processing and should be revived."
    Qin Master listened to these words and said with a smile: "We can't do it, the master who came to our factory last time understood English, could read the machine construction manual, but couldn't subdue it after playing with it for three months. Not to mention English, we don't even know how to operate it, can we do it?" Although he said that, he thought to himself: "Only this curve grinder can grind arc templates, it's a pity to leave it idle, we don't know how to operate it, can't we learn!"
    He squatted in front of the curve grinder and watched it for more than ten days. He also borrowed a Chinese "Curve Grinder Construction Manual," carefully studied it in comparison with the curve grinder several times, and understood the entire structure of the machine. He also learned some operating methods. Master Qin finally started operating the curve grinder, but he still couldn't grind out arc templates. It turned out that the "scaling instrument" on the machine was broken due to years of disrepair, and it was impossible to grind "arc templates" at all. In the past, people couldn't solve this key problem, so they retreated. But Master Qin did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. He came up with a method of using a "slide plate cam" to replace the "scaling instrument," and as a result, he ground out arc templates.
    In December 1953, the "slide plate cam" was made and installed on the curve grinder very appropriately. Master Qin continued to practice the operating method, and soon he was able to operate this machine sensitively and accurately, and began to grind out various fine arc templates. An important change occurred again in the factory's template production. A kind of fine arc template that a seventh-level fitter needed twenty or thirty days to grind, Master Qin grinded on the curve grinder in only a few hours.
    In early March of this year, in order to welcome the Second Chongqing Municipal Labor Model Representative Conference, all the employees of the factory evaluated advanced production units and individuals. The fitter team of the tool workshop was named an advanced production team, and Master Qin was named a production innovator of the Nan'an Machine Factory. The workers in the workshop calculated an account for him. In 1953 alone, in addition to completing the lettering task, the templates that Master Qin helped the fitters grind, calculated according to the quota at that time, were equal to the workload of a fifth-level fitter for four years and two months, and pointed out the road to mechanization for the fitters.

    生产革新者秦益三
    本报记者　李策
    秦益三是重庆市南岸机器厂的一个机器刻字工人。他虽然有三十多年的工龄，还是虚心学习，努力钻研，改进技术。一九五一年至一九五三年，他提了不少合理化建议，其中价值较大的，是将钳工手工磨样板改为用机器磨，并复活了一座七年未用的曲线磨床，解决了生产上的关键问题。中共重庆市委会曾经号召全市各机械厂推广他的生产革新经验，现有许多工人正以秦益三为榜样，提高自己的生产。
    一九五二年十一月，正当祖国开始第一个五年建设计划的前夕，南岸机器厂开始试制新产品，重新制造各种产品的样板。过去磨样板一直是靠手工加工的，现在厂里随着生产的需要，工具车间样板生产任务增加了一倍多，钳工们都没有信心完成。当时，秦益三看到这个情况，就想：“样板是制造新产品的工具，大家都没有信心完成这个任务，新产品试制的工作怎能成功呢？这是试制新产品的关键，一定要设法完成它”。十一月份样板生产任务中有一多半是“缺口样板”。他计划在刻字机的砂轮上磨“缺口样板”也差不多，在一次会议上向大家说：
      “你们看，我那刻字机磨‘缺口样板’行吧。”
    钳工们大多数是六、七级的老师傅，论技术谁也有两套。因此，对于一个刻字工人的建议，都没看在眼里。
    散会了，秦师傅回到家中，越想越别气，埋怨自己爱管闲事。他的爱人清楚了他发脾气的原因以后，说：“群众的力量是大的，人家都说不行，一定是不行，你干别气有啥用。”秦师傅像没有听见他爱人说话似的，躺在床上，继续想着：“我刻字的任务尽管完成了，小组的任务完不成，也要耽误新产品的试制工作呀！”他又琢磨开砂轮磨样板的事了。第二天早上他一上班就去征求工长的意见。工长说：“你去试一试吧。”
    秦师傅找到两块废样板，在刻字机的砂轮上磨光了以后，给钳工们送去。一位钳工接过磨光了的样板，用铁尺在上边左量右量，高兴地说：“行啊，光洁度很好。”有些人在旁边喊着：“看看公差怎样？”样板的公差是十分重要的，公差数不能超过一丝半。秦师傅又向钳工们要了一块“缺口样板”拿回去磨。他一边磨一边用铁尺量，快接近公差数的时候，就降低了砂轮的转数，慢慢地磨。最后，他拿样板一检查，可高兴透了，公差只差半丝，试磨的结果成功了。开始磨的慢，后来操作方法熟练了，一天最多磨到三十九块，最少也磨十八块，产量比手工生产的最高数提高了十五倍。
    一九五三年二月，新产品试制工作快要结束的时候，生产部门又需要大量的字模，这是往新产品上打上厂名、牌子和年月日用的。有些字比报纸上的新五号字还小，又要在钢料上用手工刻。秦师傅每天坐在耀眼的灯光下，戴着放大镜，弓着背，吃力地刻着。像他那样的刻字好手，一天最多刻四个，但取字模的同志整天不断地催促他说：“现在
  一天要十二个，正式生产的时候一天要四、五十个，刻得这么慢能行呀！”秦师傅心里盘算着：这么说，累死人也刻不出来。在以前碰着这种事倒也简单，把刻字刀往桌上一摔，说：“我干不了”就完啦。现在自己得想个办法，徒工朱儒才磨“缺口样板”的技术还不熟练，也需要自己动手磨。不想个办法，不但完不成刻字任务，连钳工们的样板生产也要受到影响。若叫工厂添几个刻字工人呢？那就等于自己没想办法。他时常拿手按着脑袋思虑着。
    有一天，他又用老办法检查字模刻的好坏，拿一块铅在压力机上往刻好阴纹字的字模上一压，铅上立刻现出了清晰的阳纹字。他心上豁然开朗，揣着铅块想：这是一块铅，若是一块钢呢？拿它做主模能压出多少字模！他和技术员王文光研究。王文光很赞成他的意见，又帮助他把刻了字模的钢料淬了火，变得很坚硬。他们找块不淬火的钢往上一压，压出来的阳纹字也很清楚。行政上采纳了秦师傅用主模压字模的建议。字模的生产量提高了五十倍。后来，秦师傅又把压字模的方法作了一些改进，在一小时内就能够完成一个月的生产任务。
    新产品试制期间，刻字机就包干了“缺口样板”的生产，钳工们有时间集中力量完成其他种样板，样板的数量足够了，但是“弧形样板”还是由钳工用锉刀磨，很难保证质量，有时磨圆了，有时磨扁了。弧形样板是最难做的一种样板，精密度很高，过去也是用手工加工，有些老工人为了做这种工作，要戴上老光眼镜。
    现在车间内的那部曲线磨床能解决这个困难问题，但是工厂请不到会操作方法的人，它进厂七年，
  一直躺在那里睡大觉。去年春天，厂长看到这部磨床，就对秦益三说：“应该研究这个问题，把这个车床使用起来。”苏联专家来厂参观也说：“曲线磨床是样板加工的心脏，应该复活它。”
    秦师傅听了这些话笑着说：“咱不行，前次厂里请来那位师傅懂英文，能看机器构造说明书，摆弄了三个月，也没制服它。咱别说英文，连操作法也不会，能行吗？”他嘴里虽这样说，可是心里却想：“只有这个曲线磨床才能磨弧形样板，闲放着多可惜，咱不会操作方法，还不能学一学！”
    他蹲在曲线磨床跟前，一连看了十几天。又借到一本中文的“曲线磨床构造说明书”，仔细地对照曲线磨床研究了几遍，弄清楚了机器的全部构造。并学习了一些操作方法。秦师傅终于把曲线磨床操纵起来了，但还是磨不出弧形样板。原来是机器上的“缩放仪器”，因年久失修坏了，根本不能磨“弧形样板”。过去人们解决不了这个关键问题，就退缩了。但秦师傅没有在困难面前低头，他想出了以“滑板靠模”来代替“缩放仪器”的办法，结果磨出了弧形样板。
    一九五三年十二月，“滑板靠模”做好后，安在曲线磨床上挺合适。秦师傅又不断地练习操作方法，不久，就能够灵敏而正确地操纵这部机器了，开始磨出来各种精细的弧形样板。工厂样板的生产又发生了一个重要的变化，一个七级钳工需要二、三十天磨出来的一种精细的弧形样板，秦师傅在曲线磨床上磨，只用几小时。
    今年三月初，全厂职工为了迎接重庆市第二次劳动模范代表会议，评选先进生产单位和人物。工具车间的钳工小组被评为先进生产小组，秦师傅被评为南岸机器厂生产革新者。车间的工人们替他算了一笔账，秦师傅在一九五三年一年内除了完成刻字任务外，帮助钳工们磨的样板，按当时的定额计算，就等于一个五级钳工四年零两个月的工作量，并且给钳工指出了走向机械化的道路。
