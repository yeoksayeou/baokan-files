Cultivate Qualified Senior Financial and Economic Construction Talents

    In order to further adapt the work of cultivating cadres in higher financial and economic schools to the needs of national construction, the Central Higher Education Department convened a national higher financial and economic education conference at the beginning of this month. The achievements of this conference will have a significant impact on the improvement and development of higher financial and economic education throughout the country.

    Over the past few years, after successive social reform movements, after departmental adjustments and the ideological remolding of teachers, and after studying the Soviet Union and implementing teaching reforms, higher financial and economic education throughout the country has greatly improved. At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic, our Party Central Committee decided to establish the Renmin University of China and stipulated the educational policy of "integrating teaching with practice and combining Soviet experience with China's situation." Over the past few years, the Renmin University of China has implemented this policy and achieved remarkable results. However, on the whole, the current higher financial and economic education cannot yet well meet the requirements of national construction, and there are still many problems in the work.

    According to the law of planned and proportional development of national economic construction, the plan for higher education institutions to train cadres must also stipulate reasonable proportions. However, judging from the urgency of our national construction's need for various cadres and the actual conditions for training cadres (especially since high school graduates cannot yet meet the needs of national higher education institutions' enrollment), the proportions of the various majors set up by existing higher financial and economic schools and the number of cadres trained are not reasonable enough—the proportion of management cadres belonging to the economic circulation process is relatively large, while the proportion of talents belonging to production management and planning, such as industrial economics, statistics, accounting, and national economic planning, is relatively small. The goals of training cadres in some majors are not clear, and the teaching plans are not uniform. This shows that the development of financial and economic education still has a certain degree of blindness. At the same time, the teaching quality of various higher financial and economic schools is generally still very low, and the ideological situation of students is quite complex, with uneven levels of entry. The quality of many cadres trained cannot meet the actual requirements. When national construction is developing rapidly and various departments urgently need cadres, this situation in higher financial and economic education must be effectively improved.

    This conference clearly put forward the guiding principles and tasks for higher financial and economic education in the future. That is: to cultivate, in a planned and proportional manner, senior economic theory talents and financial and economic management talents who serve the country's socialist construction, are physically sound, love the motherland, and have a certain level of Marxist-Leninist ideology and a certain amount of economic theory and professional knowledge. In terms of work pace, we should implement the central government's guiding principle of "consolidation, focused development, improved quality, and steady progress," and especially vigorously improve quality to create conditions and prepare for future development.

    Under this general spirit, the conference deeply discussed and resolved the following major issues: First, the proportion of new students enrolled in higher financial and economic schools should be appropriately reduced during the first five-year plan, with the focus on rotating training for on-the-job cadres; various majors should be selectively increased and adjusted according to the requirements of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, with different priorities. Therefore, it was determined that industrial economics, statistics, accounting, agricultural economics, and national economic planning would be the key development areas during the first five years, while also taking into account the needs of other aspects of finance and economics. At the same time, it was decided to actively utilize the existing strength of various schools to rotate training for on-the-job cadres in various relevant business departments through specialized courses, training classes, evening universities, and correspondence courses, in order to improve the political and professional level of existing cadres. Second, in order to unify and improve the training standards of higher financial and economic institutions, the training goals of various majors were further clarified, and based on the teaching plans of the same majors in Soviet higher financial and economic schools, combined with the current actual situation in China and the practical experience of the Renmin University of China over the past few years, a draft of a unified teaching plan for each major was proposed and discussed, which will be finally reviewed and promulgated by the Central Higher Education Department. Third, it was determined that higher financial and economic schools should pay special attention to recruiting revolutionary cadres and worker-peasant youth in the future, and specific measures were determined to gradually increase the worker-peasant composition of students. In the case of insufficient high school graduates and higher education institutions still not being able to strictly select students according to standards, higher financial and economic schools should also try their best to recruit on-the-job cadres for undergraduate programs. At the same time, for the long-term, it was decided that higher financial and economic schools should establish worker-peasant rapid middle schools as soon as possible to expand the source of worker-peasant students. Fourth, it was clearly stipulated that the central task of higher financial and economic schools for a considerable period of time is to further learn from the Soviet Union and continue to implement teaching reforms to improve teaching quality.

    The resolution of the above-mentioned issues will greatly help to improve higher financial and economic education in the future. What is particularly important is that everyone has a further understanding of the key issue of teaching reform. Teaching reform must focus on studying Marxist-Leninist theory and advanced Soviet experience, and transforming and improving the ideological and professional level of teachers. This is a long-term and arduous struggle, as well as a long-term and arduous basic construction work. Teaching reform, in its essence, is an ideological revolution that runs through all aspects of teaching work, and therefore is also a process of ideological struggle and ideological transformation for a considerable period of time. The characteristic of ideological transformation and ideological struggle that runs through all aspects of teaching reform is that everything must be achieved through each person's ideological consciousness in order to achieve the desired results. Therefore, on the one hand, we must adopt the methods of serious study and sincere criticism and self-criticism, and we must never adopt compulsory or rough methods. It is not right to demand too much too quickly; on the other hand, we must actively lead, actively help, patiently educate and criticize, and help each person improve their understanding. Letting things take their own course, passively waiting, or making unprincipled compromises on the part of the leadership is also wrong.

    In order to do a good job in teaching reform, the role of the teaching and research section should be given full attention. The central work of the school is teaching and scientific research, and these tasks are completed by various teachers. However, the entire teaching work is carried out under unified guidelines and plans, and the quantity and quality of each science taught by each teacher are necessary to achieve the overall guidelines and complete the overall teaching plan. If the work of the teachers is not carried out through this kind of led and organized collective activity in the teaching and research section, it will be difficult to achieve the desired results. What is particularly important is to continuously strengthen the unity of the teachers, which is an important condition for doing a good job in teaching reform. It is necessary to clearly recognize that teaching reform must rely on all teachers, and that the purpose of ideological transformation is to consolidate unity, to mobilize all teachers to wholeheartedly engage in teaching with the spirit of serving the people, and to strive to cultivate qualified talents for socialist construction. Facts have proved that only by starting from unity, actively guiding teachers to study, and constantly improving their socialist awareness, will true unity be realized.

    All leading cadres, teachers and students of higher financial and economic education must fully realize that the work of financial and economic cadres is a work that controls the lifeline of the country, so financial and economic education should demand higher quality in politics and profession. At the same time, with the development of national economic construction, the need for higher financial and economic cadres will inevitably increase day by day, and the development of higher financial and economic education will inevitably accelerate. It is completely wrong to fail to see this fact and think that financial and economic education has no future and regard financial and economic education as a "cold subject."

    All workers in higher financial and economic education should deeply appreciate the spirit of this National Higher Financial and Economic Education Conference and strive to further improve the quality of financial and economic education and cultivate qualified senior financial and economic construction talents.

    培养合格的高级财经建设人才
    为了使高等财经学校的培养干部工作进一步适合国家建设的要求，中央高等教育部于本月初旬召开了全国高等财经教育会议。这次会议的成就对于全国高等财经教育的提高和发展将有重大的作用。
    几年来，经过历次的社会改革运动，经过院系调整和教师思想改造，经过学习苏联、实行教学改革，全国高等财经教育有了很大的改进。在建国之初，我们的党中央就决定创办中国人民大学，并规定了“教学与实际联系、苏联经验与中国情况相结合”的教育方针。几年来中国人民大学贯彻执行了这一方针，取得了显著的成绩。但是总的看来，目前全国高等财经教育还不能很好地适合国家建设的要求，工作上还存在着许多问题。
    根据国家经济建设有计划按比例发展的法则，高等学校培养干部的计划中也必须规定合理的比例。但从我们国家建设对于各种干部的需要的轻重缓急和培养干部的实际条件（特别是高中毕业生还不能满足全国高等学校招生的需要）来看，现有高等财经学校的各种专业的设置和所培养的干部数量的比例还不够合理——属于经济流通过程的管理干部比例较大，而属于生产管理和计划方面的人才，如工业经济、统计、会计、国民经济计划等方面的人才，则比例较小。有的专业培养干部的目标还不明确，教学计划也不统一。这说明财经教育的发展还带有一定程度的盲目性。同时，各高等财经学校的教学质量一般的还是很低，加以学生的思想情况相当复杂，入学程度参差不齐，培养出来的许多干部的质量，还不能适合实际要求。当国家建设迅速发展，各部门迫切需要干部的时候，高等财经教育的这种情况，必须有效地加以改进。
    这次会议明确提出了今后高等财经教育的方针和任务。这就是：有计划按比例地培养为国家社会主义建设服务的，体魄健全、热爱祖国、具有一定马克思列宁主义思想水平和一定经济理论和专业知识的高级经济理论人才及财经管理人才。在工作步调上应贯彻中央所指示的“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针，尤其要大力提高质量，以创造条件，准备以后的发展。
    在这一总的精神下，会议深入讨论了和解决了下列几个主要问题：第一，高等财经学校招收新生比例，在第一个五年计划内适当地缩减，而以轮训在职干部为重点；各种专业则根据国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的要求，分别轻重缓急，有重点地增设和调整。因此，确定了工业经济、统计、会计、农业经济、国民经济计划等几个专业为第一个五年内的发展重点，并兼顾财经其他各方面的需要。同时决定积极发挥各校现有力量，以专修科、训练班、夜大学和函授等方式为各有关业务部门轮训在职干部，以提高现有干部的政治业务水平。第二，为了统一和提高高等财经院校的培养标准，进一步明确地规定了各种专业的培养目标，并以苏联高等财经学校相同专业的教学计划为依据，结合目前中国实际情况和中国人民大学几年的实践经验，提出和讨论了各专业的统一的教学计划草案，将由中央高等教育部最后审核，颁布施行。第三，确定高等财经学校今后应特别重视吸收革命干部和工农青年，并确定了具体办法，以逐渐增加学生中的工农成分。在高中毕业生不足，高等学校招生还不可能按照标准严格选择的情况下，高等财经学校本科也应尽量吸收在职干部。同时为了长期打算，决定各高等财经学校尽速设立工农速成中学，以扩大工农学生的来源。第四，明确规定了高等财经学校相当长时期内的中心任务是进一步学习苏联，继续贯彻教学改革，以提高教学质量。
    上述几个问题的解决，大大有助于今后高等财经教育的改进，特别重要的是使大家对教学改革这一关键性问题有了进一步的认识。教学改革必须从学习马克思列宁主义理论和苏联先进经验，改造和提高教师的思想和业务水平上着眼。这是一种长期艰苦的斗争，也是长期艰苦的基本建设工作。教学改革工作，从其本质来说，是贯穿教学工作各方面的一种思想革命，因而也是相当长时期内的一种思想斗争和思想改造的过程。贯穿于教学改革各方面的思想改造和思想斗争的特点，就是一切都必须通过每个人的思想自觉，才能达到预期的效果。因此一方面必须采取认真学习和诚恳的批评与自我批评的方法，决不能采取强制或粗暴的办法，要求过急是不对的；另一方面必须积极领导、积极帮助、耐心进行教育和批评，帮助每个人的认识的提高，领导方面的放任自流、消极等待或无原则的迁就，也是不对的。
    为了做好教学改革工作，教研室的作用，应加以充分的重视。学校的中心工作是教学和科学研究，而这些工作是通过各个教师来完成的。但是整个教学工作又是在统一的方针和计划下来进行的，每一个教师所教的每门科学的数量和质量都是为实现总的方针和完成总的教学计划所必需的。如果教师们的工作不通过教研室这种有领导、有组织的集体活动，那是很难取得应有的效果的。特别重要的是不断加强教师们的团结，这是做好教学改革工作的重要条件。要明确认识教学改革要依靠全体教师来进行，而思想改造的目的就在于巩固团结，就在于动员全体教师本着为人民服务的精神全心全意地搞好教学，为社会主义建设培养合格的人才而奋斗。事实证明，只有从团结出发，积极引导教师们进行学习，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟，才会实现真正的团结。
    全体高等财经教育的领导干部和师生必须充分认识到财经干部的工作是掌握国家命脉的工作，因此财经教育在政治上业务上应要求更高的质量。同时随着国家经济建设的发展，高等财经干部的需要也必然日益增长，高等财经教育的发展也必然加速。看不到这一事实，认为财经教育没有前途，把财经教育当作“冷门”的观点是完全错误的。
    全体高等财经教育工作者应深刻体会这次全国高等财经教育会议的精神，为进一步提高财经教育质量，培养合格的高级财经建设人才而奋斗。
