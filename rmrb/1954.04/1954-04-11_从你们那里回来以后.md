    After Returning From Your Place

    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:

    After our reluctant farewells, we returned safely to the motherland. From Tianjin to Taiyuan, and from Taiyuan back to the special district and the counties, we were warmly welcomed by the people of our hometowns. They were all eager to know about our visit to Korea and the heroic deeds of you and the Korean people.

    To satisfy the demands of the people of the motherland, we began to make reports to them on January 18th. In these reports, the Party committees and people's governments at all levels, as well as the Resist America, Aid Korea branches, attached great importance to this and helped us a lot. Responsible cadres in many areas even came a long way with the masses to greet us. The report meetings were personally presided over by responsible comrades from each county, and the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. When we gave reports in the squares of Yangcheng and Jincheng counties, the ground was covered with white snow, but no one showed any sign of being afraid of the cold. An old man whose family member was a soldier even said, "I'm sweating from listening!" Whenever we talked about your heroic deeds or recited the lyrics and couplets you created yourselves, the audience responded with warm applause. Many people even copied these lyrics to recite to others and asked for your mailing addresses to establish regular communication with you. For this purpose, we specially printed booklets containing the addresses of more than 300 of you and distributed them to everyone. By March 6th, according to incomplete statistics, a portion of the masses from just the five counties of Gaoping and others had sent you 8,984 letters. You must have received these letters by now!

    Moreover, everyone who has heard the reports has been moved by your heroic deeds. They are using your spirit to examine their own work, production, and study, and are making plans to improve themselves, determined to support you with practical actions. Two typists at the Changzhi Central Branch of the People's Bank said in a discussion: "Volunteer Army female clerk Xiao Jie worked continuously for six or seven days and nights without sleeping because of work needs, and she didn't complain at all. Sometimes when our work is tense, we get a little impatient. We are really sorry to the Volunteer Army. We are determined to learn from this female hero in the future!" Guo Quanyou, the militia captain of Liuchang Township, First District, Yangcheng County, used to be afraid of hardship and lacked enthusiasm for his work. After hearing our reports, he was greatly moved. He said: "Like Ma Junkun (a hero of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army), the hard bone of the proletariat, who was wounded three times and had his leg blown off, but persisted in fighting for victory until he gloriously sacrificed himself. I am unwilling to do even a little work in a peaceful environment. I really shouldn't! I am really sorry to the Volunteer Army! I am determined to do a good job in militia work in the future and strive to realize the Party's general line!" Comrade Jiao Laifu of the Gaoping County Grain Bureau originally planned to buy 500,000 yuan of public bonds; after hearing the reports, he decided to save expenses and subscribed to 2.5 million yuan. After we made reports at the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in Pingshun County, everyone unanimously expressed that they would do a good job in the work of tilling and contracting land for agricultural production cooperatives to thank you, and also wrote a letter of comfort to you in the name of the conference. Farmers in Gukou Village, First District, Gaoping County, in order to express their love for you, rectified the land-tilling work in advance, and all 32 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the village had someone responsible for their land. Li Youshun, the civil affairs director of Runcheng Township, Second District, Yangcheng County, convened a meeting of all members of the mutual aid group on the evening of the day he heard the reports to discuss and formulate a plan for preferential treatment of soldiers' families. The next day, before dawn, group member Li Yonghua ran to the civil affairs director, asking to carry manure for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and to ensure increased production on their land. Ren Huanhai, a female labor model in Wuxiang County, said: "I want to learn from the spirit of Volunteer Army soldier Chen Renhui, mobilize all 80 women in the cooperative to participate in production, and organize eleven preferential treatment groups to ensure that the 36 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in our cooperative do not suffer any difficulties. I want to love the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers as much as I love my own parents!"

    Around the Spring Festival, all sixteen counties in the entire special district successively convened enlarged cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels, civil affairs work meetings, labor model representative meetings, and mutual aid and cooperation meetings. At these meetings, we made reports to all the attendees. According to incomplete statistics, the audience reached more than 151,000 people. They all unanimously expressed that they would learn from your spirit, implement the general line of the state during the transition period, develop and consolidate mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and do a good job in preparing for spring plowing. The general line of our country during the transition period has indeed illuminated the hearts of the people of the entire special district. The farmers said: "We must strive to 'get on the boat early, transition early, and live a better life early'!" At present, 2,752 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the entire special district, and together with the 984 in the past, there are 3,736. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounts for 19.7% of the total peasant households in the entire special district. In the process of building cooperatives, the confidence and determination of the peasants to actively take the socialist road have been further encouraged and strengthened. Therefore, not only has there been a large number of mutual aid groups requesting to be transformed into cooperatives, but mutual aid groups have also developed greatly. For example, the 154 new agricultural production cooperatives established in Tunliu County were transformed from the original 213 permanent mutual aid groups and three seasonal mutual aid groups.

    Comrade Guo Yu'en, the nationally renowned labor model and winner of the 1952 Patriotic丰产 Gold Star Medal, who went to Korea to see you this time, not only actively carried out propaganda activities after returning to his hometown, but also actively expanded and consolidated his agricultural production cooperative. The cooperative has been expanded from the original 76 households to 150 households. They have also formulated this year's production increase plan, which plans to increase the average yield per mu by 50 jin compared to last year. Ma Baobei, as you know, was the women's representative of this visit to Korea comfort group and the director of the Beipo Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifth District of Changzhi County. After returning to her hometown this time, she made reports to the masses and organized the members of the cooperative to discuss, which further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses; many people asked to join the cooperative, and the cooperative also expanded. After hearing her reports, Song Wangze took everyone to deliver manure to the fields before dawn on the second day of the Spring Festival. When people asked him why, he said, "The Volunteer Army still has to guard their positions during the Spring Festival in Korea. Can we not guarantee to produce more grain to support them!"

    Dear comrades, the peaceful environment that you have bravely fought for with your blood and sweat guarantees the smooth progress of the various construction undertakings of the motherland, and therefore the people of the motherland must first thank you. Please rest assured, comrades, we will never fail to live up to our promise, and we must work hard, produce well, and produce more grain to support you and to support our country's socialist industrial construction!

      The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea Comfort Group, Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province
                Representatives: Jia Yunlong, Deputy Commissioner of the Special Commissioner's Office, Guo Yu'en, winner of the Patriotic丰产 Gold Star Medal, and ten others

### 从你们那里回来以后

1954-04-11

专栏：寄战士

    从你们那里回来以后亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    咱们依依不舍地分别以后，我们一路平安地回到了祖国。从天津到太原，从太原回到专区、各县，到处都受到了家乡人民的热烈欢迎。他们都盼望着早点知道我们在朝鲜慰问的情景，盼望着早点知道你们和朝鲜人民的英雄事迹。
    为了满足祖国人民的要求，我们从一月十八日开始，就向他们进行了传达报告。在传达报告中，各级党委、人民政府和抗美援朝分会都十分重视，他们帮助我们做了很多工作。有许多地区的负责干部，还和群众一块，到很远的地方来迎接我们。报告会都由各县负责同志亲自主持，群众情绪都很高。在阳城、晋城县的广场上做报告时，地上还铺着皑皑的白雪，可是没有一个人显示出怕冷的样子。一个军属老汉还说：“我听得都出汗了！”每当我们谈到你们的英雄事迹或念到你们自己创作的歌词、对联时，听众都报以热烈的掌声，很多人还把这些歌词抄写回去，准备向别人朗诵，并要求知道你们的通讯地址，和你们建立经常的通信联系。为了这，我们专门印制了你们当中三百多人的通信地址的小册子，分发给大家了。到三月六日，据不完全统计，光高平等五个县的一部分群众，就给你们寄去了八千九百八十四封信。这些信，想你们早已收到了吧！
    不仅如此，凡听过传达报告的人，都被你们的英雄事迹所感动，都在用你们的精神检查自己的工作、生产和学习，并且订出自己的改进计划，决心以实际行动来支援你们。人民银行长治中心支行，有两个打字员在讨论中说：“志愿军的女文印员萧捷同志，因为工作的需要，一连工作六、七昼夜不睡觉，都没有怨言；咱有时工作紧张了，就有点不耐烦，真对不起志愿军。今后决心向这位女功臣学习！”郭全有，是阳城县第一区刘昌乡的民兵队长，他过去怕吃苦，工作劲头不大。听了我们的传达报告以后，大受感动。他说：“像无产阶级的硬骨头麻俊坤（志愿军某部功臣），三次负了伤，腿都叫炸断了，但为了胜利，一直坚持战斗，直到光荣牺牲。我自己在和平环境下做一点工作，还不愿干，真不应该！真对不起志愿军！我下定决心，今后要做好民兵工作，为实现党的总路线而奋斗！”高平县粮食局焦来福同志，原计划买五十万元的公债；听了传达报告后，决定节约开支，认购了二百五十万元。当我们在平顺县各界人民代表会议上作了传达报告后，大家一致表示：要把农业生产合作社的代耕、包耕工作做好，来感谢你们，还以大会的名义给你们写了慰问信。高平县第一区谷口村的农民，为了表达对你们的热爱，提前整顿了代耕工作，全村三十二户烈属、军属，都做到了户户有人负责。阳城县第二区润城乡的民政主任李有顺，在听了传达报告的当天晚上就召集全互助组的组员开会，讨论和订出了优属代耕计划。组员李永华第二天天还未亮，就跑去找民政主任，要求去给烈属、军属担粪，保证做到烈属、军属的土地增产。武乡县的女劳动模范任焕孩说：“我要学习志愿军陈仁慧的精神，发动全社八十个妇女参加生产，还要组织十一个优属小组，保证我社三十六户烈属、军属不受任何困难。我要像热爱自己父母一样地爱戴烈属、军属！”
    春节前后，全专区十六个县都先后召开了县、区、乡三级的扩大干部会议、民政工作会议、劳动模范代表会议和互助合作会议。在这些会议上，我们都向所有到会的人员做了传达报告。根据不完全的统计，听众达十五万一千余人。他们都一致表示，要学习你们的精神，贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线，发展和巩固互助合作组织，做好春耕生产的准备等工作。咱们国家过渡时期的总路线，的确照亮了全专区人民的心。农民说：要争取“早上船，早过渡，早过更好的光景”！目前，全专区又建立了两千七百五十二个新的农业生产合作社，加上过去的九百八十四个，就有三千七百三十六个了。入社的农户占全专区总农户的百分之十九点七。在建社的过程中，进一步鼓舞和坚定了农民积极走社会主义道路的信心和决心。因此，不但出现了成批的互助组要求转社的情况，同时互助组也有很大的发展。比如，屯留县新建的一百五十四个农业生产合作社，就是由原来的二百一十三个常年互助组、三个季节互助组转成的。
    这次到朝鲜去看你们的全国著名劳动模范、一九五二年爱国丰产金星奖章获得者郭玉恩同志，回乡后不但积极进行宣传活动，还积极地把自己的农业生产合作社扩大和巩固了。合作社已由原来的七十六户扩大为一百五十户。他们还订出了今年的增产计划，计划每亩平均要比去年增产五十斤粮食。马宝贝，你们是知道的，她是这次赴朝慰问团的妇女代表，长治县第五区北坡乡农业生产合作社的社长。她这次回乡后，就向群众进行传达报告，并组织社员们作了讨论，进一步启发了群众的积极性；好多人都要求入社，合作社也扩大了。宋王则听了她的传达报告后，在春节的第二天天不明，就带着大家往地里送粪，人家问他为什么，他说：“志愿军在朝鲜过年还要严守阵地，我们还能不保证多打粮食，来支援他们！”
    亲爱的同志们，你们英勇奋斗用血汗换来的和平环境，保障了祖国各项建设事业的顺利进行，因之祖国人民首先要感谢你们。请放心吧，同志们，我们绝不会辜负自己的诺言，一定要好好工作，好好生产，多打粮食，来支援你们，来支援咱们国家社会主义的工业建设！
      中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团山西省长治专区
                代表、专署副专员贾云龙，爱国丰
                产金星奖章获得者郭玉恩等十人
