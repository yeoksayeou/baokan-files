The National Conference on Political and Legal Education, convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, opened on the 26th. The main agenda of the conference is: to clarify the direction and tasks of national political and legal education; to discuss how to further implement the principle of combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's actual conditions to improve teaching quality; to discuss and formulate teaching plans for political and legal colleges and university law majors; and to study the national higher political and legal faculties' enrollment plans for 1954 to 1957, as well as methods for training teachers for various types of political and legal schools.

The conference opened with a speech by Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government. Huang Songling, Vice Minister of Higher Education, delivered a "Report on the Direction and Tasks of Political and Legal Education" on behalf of Minister Ma Xulun. In his report, Huang Songling pointed out that over the past four years, with the development of national political and legal work, under the leadership of the central and local Party and government leading organs, political and legal education has achieved certain successes. These are mainly reflected in: First, in accordance with the state's need for political and legal cadres, four types of institutions and departments for training political and legal cadres have been established and adjusted, including central and greater administrative region political and legal cadre schools (three), provincial and municipal training classes (seventy-three), political and legal colleges (four), and university law departments and programs, training a total of more than 100,000 public security, judicial, procuratorial, and civil affairs cadres; and cultivated more than 5,000 young students. Second, in 1950, the Law Department of Renmin University of China was established. Under the direct assistance of Soviet experts, a teaching plan for the Law Department was formulated, more than one hundred teachers were trained, a batch of teaching syllabuses and materials were compiled, a relatively complete teaching system and teaching organization were established, and advanced teaching methods were adopted, creating experience for the teaching work of other university law departments and political and legal colleges, and pointing out the direction. Third, the old higher political and legal departments were reorganized, and new types of political and legal colleges were established. The political and legal colleges established after the departmental adjustments have established the leadership of the working class ideology, basically eliminated the reactionary Kuomintang Six Laws viewpoint; under the leadership of the political and legal departments or in close contact with the political and legal departments, the teaching content is increasingly integrated with the actual construction of political and legal affairs.

Huang Songling pointed out that our country has entered the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation, and the class struggle during this period is extremely complex and sharp. Political and legal cadres stand at the forefront of this struggle. In the face of this situation and task, political and legal work must not only rely on mobilizing the strength of the people, but also gradually strengthen and use the people's democratic legal system to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, so as to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and various socialist transformation undertakings, and protect the democratic rights of the people from infringement. Therefore, it has become an important political and organizational task to strengthen political and legal education work in a planned way.

In his report, Huang Songling put forward the direction and tasks of national political and legal education, and put forward improvement opinions on the main problems existing in current political and legal education for discussion at the conference.

Representatives from national higher political and legal colleges and university law departments and programs, central and greater administrative region political and legal cadre schools attended the conference. Representatives from the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, relevant central political and legal departments, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and relevant universities were also invited to attend.

    中央人民政府高等教育部
    召开全国政法教育会议
    中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国政法教育会议二十六日开幕。会议主要议程是：明确全国政法教育的方针任务；讨论如何进一步贯彻学习苏联先进经验与中国实际相结合的方针以提高教学质量；讨论拟订政法学院和大学法律专业的教学计划；研究全国高等政法院系一九五四年到一九五七年的招生计划，以及各类政法学校师资的培养办法。
    会议由中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡致开幕词。高等教育部副部长黄松龄代表马叙伦部长作了“关于政法教育方针任务的报告”。黄松龄在报告中指出：四年来，随着全国政法工作的发展，在中央和各级党政领导机关的领导下，政法教育工作获得一定的成绩。主要表现在：第一，按照国家培养政法干部的需要，创办了和调整成立了中央和大区政法干部学校（三所）、省市训练班（七十三所）、政法学院（四所）以及大学法律系科等四种培养政法干部的院系和机构，总共训练了十万以上的公安、司法、检察、民政干部；并培养了青年学生五千余人。第二，一九五○年成立中国人民大学法律系，即在苏联专家的直接帮助下，订了法律系的教学计划，培养了一百多个教师，编译了一批教学大纲和教材，建立了比较完整的教学制度、教学组织和采用先进的教学方法，为其他大学法律系及政法学院的教学工作创造了经验，指出了方向。第三，整顿了旧的高等政法系科，成立了新型的政法学院。经过院系调整后建立的政法学院树立了工人阶级思想的领导，基本上肃清了反动的国民党六法观点；在政法部门的领导下或与政法部门密切联系的条件下，教学内容日益结合政法建设的实际。
    黄松龄指出：我们的国家已进入社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段，这一时期的阶级斗争是极其复杂和尖锐的。而政法工作干部则站在这个斗争的最前列。在这种情况和任务面前，政法工作不仅要依靠发动人民群众的力量，而且要逐步加强和运用人民民主的法制，进一步巩固人民民主专政，以保障社会主义建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行，保护人民群众的民主权利使之不受侵犯。因此，有计划地加强政法教育工作，已成为当前一项重要的政治任务和组织任务。
    黄松龄在报告中提出了全国政法教育的方针任务，并对当前政法教育存在的主要问题提出了改进意见，供大会讨论。
    参加这次会议的有全国各高等政法学院和大学法律系科、中央及大区政法干部学校的代表，会议并邀请了中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会、中央各有关政法部门、中共中央宣传部和有关大学的代表参加。（新华社）
