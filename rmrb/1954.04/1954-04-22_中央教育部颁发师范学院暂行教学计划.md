    The Central Ministry of Education recently issued provisional teaching plans for nine departments of teachers colleges, including Chinese Language and Literature, Russian Language, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Education. It instructed all teachers colleges (schools) to implement them on a trial basis starting with the first-year students of the 1954 academic year. The courses for the first-year students of the 1954 academic year should be offered in accordance with the provisions of the provisional teaching plan. Schools with the necessary conditions may also offer courses for the second-year students in accordance with the teaching plan. The original plan for the third and fourth grades can be maintained basically unchanged, but students who have not studied the necessary courses in secondary schools or the required common courses of Chinese Revolutionary History and Pedagogy must be given supplementary instruction before graduation.

    In order to correctly implement the provisional teaching plan for teachers colleges, the Central Ministry of Education formulated the "General Explanation of the Provisional Teaching Plan for Teachers Colleges." The explanation clearly stipulates and elaborates in detail on the four components included in the teachers college teaching plan—political theory courses, education courses, professional courses, and teaching practice—as well as their purpose, and on the basic forms of teaching work in teachers colleges, such as lecturing, practical exercises, classroom discussions and special topic classroom discussions, independent student work, and tutoring.

    In 1952, the Central Ministry of Education printed and distributed a teaching plan (draft) for teachers colleges, which stipulated the training objectives of various teachers colleges (schools) and pointed out the direction of teaching work, thus changing the previous situation of aimless and unplanned teaching work. However, this teaching plan (draft) had shortcomings such as insufficient integration with China's reality and overly high requirements. The revised provisional teaching plan overcomes the above shortcomings. The main principle of this revision is that, according to the training objectives of teachers colleges, the teaching plans of each department must include four parts: political theory courses, education courses, professional courses, and teaching practice. These four components are organically interconnected. This teaching plan also combines China's historical conditions and the current national construction tasks, as well as the actual situation of secondary schools and higher normal schools, so it is both directional and realistic.

    Since higher normal schools across the country are still in the initial stage of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms, and there are still imbalances in terms of teachers, equipment, and student levels, it is impossible to formulate a teaching plan that suits the situation of all teachers colleges (schools). Therefore, this teaching plan does not require all teachers colleges (schools) and all grades to immediately implement it in full at present, but rather serves as the general direction for the efforts of all teachers colleges (schools), requiring all teachers colleges (schools) to actively create conditions to basically achieve it in the last year of the first Five-Year Plan.

### 中央教育部颁发师范学院暂行教学计划

    中央教育部颁发师范学院暂行教学计划
    中央人民政府教育部最近颁发了师范学院中国语文、俄语、历史、地理、数学、物理、化学、生物、教育等九个系的暂行教学计划，并指示各师范学院（校）自一九五四学年度一年级开始试行。一九五四学年度一年级的课程应按暂行教学计划的规定开设。有条件的学校二年级亦可按照教学计划规定开课。三、四年级可维持原定计划基本不动，但如有未学过中等学校所必需的课程或共同必修科目的中国革命史、教育学的学生，须在毕业前予以补授。
    为了正确地执行师范学院暂行教学计划，中央人民政府教育部制订了“师范学院暂行教学计划总说明”。说明中对于师范学院教学计划中所包括的政治理论科目、教育科目、专业科目和教育实习等四个组成部分及其设置的目的，对于师范学院教学工作的基本形式如讲授、实习作业、课堂讨论和专题课堂讨论、学生的独立作业、辅导等，都作了明确的规定和较详细的阐述。
    中央人民政府教育部在一九五二年曾印发过师范学院教学计划（草案），规定了各师范学院（校）的培养目标，指明了教学工作的方向，因而改变了以往教学工作中无目的、无计划的状况。但这个教学计划（草案）存在结合中国实际不够，要求偏高的缺点。经修订后的暂行教学计划克服了以上缺点。这次修订的主要原则是根据师范学院的培养目标，规定了各系的教学计划必须包括有政治理论科目、教育科目、专业科目和教育实习四个部分。这四个组成部分是有机地互相关联的。这个教学计划还结合了我国的历史条件和当前国家建设的任务以及中等学校、高等师范学校的实际情况，所以是具有方向性和现实性的。
    由于全国各高等师范学校在学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革方面还处在开始阶段，各高等师范学校在师资、设备和学生程度等方面还存在不平衡性，不可能制订出一个适合全国各师范学院（校）情况的教学计划，因此，这次教学计划不要求所有师范学院（校）、所有年级在目前立即全部实行，而是成为各师范学院（校）努力的总方向，要求各师范学院（校）积极创造条件在第一个五年计划的最后一年都能基本上实现。　（新华社）
