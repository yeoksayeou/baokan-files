Guangxi Province Anticipates a Bumper Harvest of Ramie

In Pingle and Lipu counties of Guangxi Province, known for ramie production, the ramie is growing well.

Pingle and Lipu produce approximately three million jin of ramie annually. The fibers are fine, long, soft, glossy, and resilient, making it an excellent industrial raw material. In recent years, due to the development of industry in our country and the government's support for ramie farmers, state-owned trading companies have been actively purchasing ramie, leading to brisk sales and greatly boosting the farmers' enthusiasm for production. This year, while ensuring that grain production acreage is not reduced, farmers in various areas have restored and appropriately expanded the acreage planted with ramie, paying attention to fertilization, inter-tillage, pest control, and improved cultivation techniques. For example, Zheng Zhicai, a ramie farmer from Anliang Township in Pingle District, applied 50 to 60 loads of cattle manure and other fertilizers per mu last winter. He also broke the old tradition of not using tung cake, applying more than one dan of tung cake per mu. As a result, this year's ramie is growing very well. He said, "In the past, ramie prices were manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, so who had the heart to grow it? Now that the ramie price is fair and reasonable, more ramie harvested means a better life for ourselves and support for national economic construction. Why not grow more?"

Currently, ramie farmers are strengthening field management of ramie. In another month, the first harvest of ramie will begin (ramie can be harvested three to four times a year). Local trading companies are now actively engaged in advance purchase and ordering work.

    广西省青麻丰收在望
    广西省盛产青麻的平乐、荔浦两县，青麻生长情况良好。
    平乐、荔浦年产青麻约三百万斤，纤维细长柔软、光泽，富韧性，是很好的工业原料。近年来，由于我国工业的发展以及人民政府对麻农的扶助，国营贸易公司大力收购，青麻畅销，大大提高了麻农的生产情绪。今年各地麻农都在不缩小粮食生产面积的原则下，恢复并适当地扩大了青麻种植面积，并注意施肥、中耕、除虫，改进耕作技术。如平乐一区安良乡麻农郑芝才，去年冬，除了每亩放牛栏粪等肥料五、六十担外，还打破了以往不放桐麸的老例，每亩放了桐麸一担多，因此今年的麻长得很好。他说：“往时麻价被奸商操纵，哪个有心种。现在麻价公平合理，麻收多了，自己生活好过，又能支援国家经济建设，还不多种到几时。”
    目前麻农正加强青麻田间管理工作，再过一个月就可以收割头麻了（青麻一年可收三道至四道）。当地贸易公司现正积极展开青麻的预购订购工作。
