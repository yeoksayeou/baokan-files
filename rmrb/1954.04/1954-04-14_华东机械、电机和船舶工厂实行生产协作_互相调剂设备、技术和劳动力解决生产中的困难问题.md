Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th. Twenty-eight state-owned and joint state-private machinery, electrical, and shipbuilding factories in East China have achieved regular, organized production collaboration. Under the auspices of the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government, these factories recently held their fourth production collaboration meeting, signing forty-three agreements for mutual support in production for the second quarter of this year. Including the previous three agreements, the factories have, in an organized manner, resolved more than 320 difficult production issues arising from imbalances in equipment, technology, and labor. This is of great significance for further leveraging the potential of East China's machinery industry to meet the needs of national construction.

	The trial production of China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator has been accelerated due to broader production collaboration. The state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, responsible for manufacturing the turbine, encountered difficulties in manufacturing many special tools for producing precise turbine blades. At two production collaboration meetings, with the assistance of the state-owned Shanghai Tool Factory and Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, this factory successively signed agreements to jointly manufacture 107 types of special cutting tools, resolving this problem. The state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory, responsible for manufacturing the turbine boiler, also found assistance from other factories at the meeting. The forging of diesel engine crankshafts is currently one of the most difficult problems in China's power machinery industry, given the existing equipment and technology. At the most recent collaboration meeting, relevant factories preliminarily drafted a plan to balance crankshaft forging. In the second quarter, Jiangnan Shipyard, Hudong Shipyard, and others will help various power machinery factories forge 110 crankshafts for 60 to 300 horsepower diesel engines.

	Recently, the relevant machinery and electrical factories in East China have also implemented a "collaborative production, complete set supply" approach. The state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, and the joint state-private Huatong Switch Factory are planning to jointly produce complete sets of small-scale power generation equipment, including diesel engines, generators, and switchboards, with capacities of 200 or 135 kilowatts. This small-scale power generation equipment can provide lighting electricity for small towns with a population of 12,000 households, or power and lighting electricity for agricultural production cooperatives, flour mills, rice mills, oil presses, or small mines. It can also be used as auxiliary power generators for ships. This approach can change the past situation where related product specifications from various factories were inconsistent, making it impossible to assemble complete sets of equipment and leading to product backlog.

	The regular organized production collaboration of twenty-eight factories in East China has not only mutually adjusted equipment, technology, and labor, but also, to a considerable extent, solved the difficulties faced by some factories in the first two quarters of this year due to insufficient production tasks.

    华东机械、电机和船舶工厂实行生产协作
    互相调剂设备、技术和劳动力解决生产中的困难问题
    【新华社上海十三日电】华东区二十八个国营和公私合营机械、电机、船舶工厂，已经做到经常有组织地实行生产协作。在中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东办事处主持下，这些工厂最近举行了第四次生产协作会议，签订了今年第二季度各厂在生产上互相支援的协议书四十三份。连同前三次协议，各厂之间有组织地解决了三百二十多项由于设备、技术和劳动力不平衡而发生的生产中的困难问题，对于进一步发挥华东机械工业的潜力以满足国家建设的需要有重大作用。
    我国第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机的试制工作，由于更广泛的生产协作加速了进度。负责制造汽轮机的国营上海汽轮机厂在制造精密的汽轮叶片时，有许多种特殊的工具制造有困难。在两次生产协作会议上，这个工厂在国营上海工具厂和上海机床厂协助下先后签订了合作制造一百零七种特殊刀具等的协议书，解决了这个问题。负责制造汽轮机锅炉的国营上海锅炉厂，也在会议上找到其他厂的协助。柴油机曲轴的锻制，是目前我国动力机械工业现有设备和技术上最感困难的一个问题。最近一次协作会议上，有关工厂之间初步拟定了一个平衡曲轴锻制的方案。江南造船厂、沪东造船厂等在第二季度中，将帮助各动力机厂锻制六十到三百匹马力柴油机曲轴一百一十根。
    最近，华东区各有关机械、电机厂还实行了一种“协作生产、成套供应”的办法，由国营上海电机厂、上海汽轮机厂和公私合营华通开关厂有计划地共同生产一种包括柴油机、发电机及开关台等全套小型发电设备二百或一百三十五瓩。这种小型发电设备可以供一万二千户人口小城镇的照明用电，或供农业生产合作社、面粉厂、碾米厂、榨油厂或小型矿山的动力和照明用电，也可以作为船舶用发电辅机。这种办法，可以改变过去各厂有关产品规格不一致，不能装配成套设备而使产品积压的现象。
    华东区二十八个工厂经常有组织地实行生产协作，不仅互相调剂了设备、技术和劳动力，而且也在不小的程度上解决了今年头两季度中有些工厂生产任务不足的困难。
