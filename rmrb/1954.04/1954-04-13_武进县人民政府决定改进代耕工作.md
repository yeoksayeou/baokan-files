Wujin County People's Government in Jiangsu Province wrote: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column published on February 26th included a letter from Comrade Huang Yuansheng, pointing out that the method of issuing substitute farming fees in Daba Township, Xinzha District, in our county, could not solve the production difficulties of military families. After our investigation, this was indeed the case. The reason for this situation is mainly that we did not check the preferential treatment substitute farming work sufficiently in the past. We sincerely accept Comrade Huang Yuansheng's suggestion. In addition to urging Xinzha District to immediately check and resolve the difficulties of military families, and based on the current development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, we will try our best to assign the substitute farming work to fixed labor, contracting it out to mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives. Xinzha District has decided at the cadre meeting on March 10th that substitute farming fees will no longer be collected in the future, and the substitute farming fees that were not collected in full in 1953 will be collected in the shortest possible time and the accounts will be made public. Most other districts and townships in our county are currently using the method of issuing substitute farming fees in substitute farming work. We are preparing to convene a county-wide civil affairs conference in the near future to specifically study and improve substitute farming work.

    武进县人民政府决定改进代耕工作
    江苏省武进县人民政府来信：二月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了黄元生同志的来信，指出我县新闸区大坝乡发代耕费的办法不能解决军属生产困难，经我们调查，确系事实。发生这种情况的原因，主要是我们平时对优抚代耕工作检查不够。我们诚恳接受黄元生同志的意见，除已督促新闸区立即检查和解决军属的困难外，并根据目前互助合作运动的发展情况，尽量将代耕工作做到固定劳动力，包到互助组或农业生产合作社里去。新闸区已在三月十日的干部会议上决定今后不收代耕费，并将一九五三年未能收清的代耕费在最短期内收清，公布账目。我县其它区、乡目前在代耕工作中大部也采用发代耕费的办法，我们准备在最近召开全县民政会议，专门研究改进代耕工作。
