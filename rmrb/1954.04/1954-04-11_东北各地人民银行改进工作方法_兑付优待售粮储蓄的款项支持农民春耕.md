    People's Banks in Northeast China Improve Working Methods to Redeem Preferential Grain Sale Savings and Support Farmers' Spring Planting
    People's Bank of China branches and sub-branches in Northeast China are actively redeeming preferential grain sale savings to support farmers' spring plowing and production. In order to facilitate farmers' withdrawals, People's Banks in Northeast China have appropriately simplified redemption procedures, improved working methods, and sent cadres to rural areas to carry out redemption work. The Dongfeng County Branch of the People's Bank of China in Liaodong Province, for example, dispatched 30 staff members to rural areas to contract for redemption procedures by district. People's Banks in various places also entrusted rural supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to handle redemption business on their behalf.
    As of March 20, the preferential grain sale savings redeemed in the entire Northeast region accounted for 17 percent of the total amount of savings received. Due to timely redemption and simplified procedures, this has not only supported spring plowing and production but also further consolidated the credibility of national banks in carrying out savings in rural areas. After farmers in Yangcao Village, Dehui County, Jilin Province, withdrew their savings, eight households bought livestock, three bought carts, and ten bought fodder, solving many difficulties in spring plowing and production. Some farmers were not very confident about being able to withdraw their savings easily after saving, but after the bank redeemed their savings in a timely manner, they happily stated that they would deposit the money they received from selling grain into the national bank again in the fall. Li Yaowu, a farmer in Heilinzi Village, Yushu County, tried depositing seven million yuan for a period of one month because he was afraid of the trouble of withdrawing money. When he saw that the procedures were simple when he withdrew the money, he deposited another six million yuan into the bank.

    东北各地人民银行改进工作方法
    兑付优待售粮储蓄的款项支持农民春耕
    中国人民银行东北区各地分、支机构积极兑付优待售粮储蓄款，支持农民春耕生产。为了便利农民取款，东北各地人民银行都适当简化了兑付手续，改进了工作方法，并派出干部深入农村进行兑付工作。中国人民银行辽东省东丰县支行即抽调了三十名工作人员到农村分片包干办理兑付手续。各地人民银行还委托农村供销合作社和信用合作社代办兑付业务。
    到三月二十日止，东北全区兑付的优待售粮储蓄款，占收储总额的百分之十七。由于兑付及时，手续简便，既支持了春耕生产，又进一步巩固了国家银行在农村开展储蓄的信誉。吉林省德惠县洋草村农民取回储蓄款后，有八户买了牲畜，三户买了车，十户买了马草，解决了春耕生产中的不少困难。有的农民储蓄后怕提取困难，不很放心，在银行及时兑付了储蓄款后，都高兴地表示，今年秋后还要把卖粮得到的钱存入国家银行。榆树县黑林子村农民李耀武因怕取款时麻烦，试着存了七百万元，期限一个月，取款时见手续简便，又把六百万元继续存入银行了。
