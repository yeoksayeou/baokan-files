    Anhui Province Pre-Purchases Wheat and Rapeseed
    Entrusted by the state, the cooperative system in Anhui Province has launched a pre-purchase program for wheat and rapeseed throughout the province since early March. This has powerfully supported spring plowing and production, and struck a blow against rural usury.
    During the pre-purchase process, cooperatives in various parts of Anhui Province, combined with in-depth publicity of the General Line, explained the benefits of pre-purchase work to the country and the peasants. The broad masses of peasants actively pre-sold wheat and rapeseed to the state. As of March 2nd, farmers in Sihu Township, Daqiao District, Dangtu County, had pre-sold more than 184,900 jin of wheat and 227,400 jin of rapeseed. The Huayuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangqiao District, Shou County, took the lead in pre-selling 9,984 jin of wheat and guaranteed to dry and clean the wheat and deliver it to the state grain purchasing station on time.
    In previous years, when the spring plowing season arrived, some farmers had to endure usury exploitation in order to solve the "lean season" difficulties. Last year, in Longzhuang electoral district, Sihu Township, Dangtu County, 36 households borrowed at high interest rates, totaling more than 9 million yuan. Farmer Zhou Chengyin borrowed two dan of sweet potatoes last year, and this autumn he has to repay two dan of rice. This year, the state has carried out pre-purchase work, paying a large amount of interest-free deposit to the peasants, enabling them to carry out spring plowing and production smoothly. The 867 pre-selling households in Sihu Township, Daqiao District, Dangtu County, received more than 94 million yuan in deposits, averaging more than 100,000 yuan per household, with the most receiving more than 400,000 yuan. Farmers in Qiaobei electoral district of the township used more than 56 percent of their deposits to purchase means of production. Xu Jiayou, the head of a mutual aid team, said: "Our mutual aid team's farm tools were broken, and we were worried about not having cash to repair them. Now that we have the deposit, we can repair the farm tools and carry out spring plowing and production in a timely manner." After receiving the deposit, the farmers in Shagang Township, Lincheng District, Xuyi County, immediately ordered more than 500 pieces of agricultural implements from the cooperative.

    安徽省预购小麦菜籽
    安徽省合作社系统接受国家委托，从三月上旬起在全省范围内展开小麦和菜籽的预购工作，有力地支持了春耕生产，打击了农村高利贷剥削。
    在进行预购时，安徽省各地合作社结合深入宣传总路线，说明了预购工作对国家和农民的好处，广大农民踊跃将小麦和菜籽预售给国家。当涂县大桥区四垾乡农民，到三月二日，已预售小麦十八万四千九百多斤、菜籽二十二万七千四百斤。寿县双桥区花园农业生产合作社带头预售小麦九千九百八十四斤，并保证要按时把小麦晒干扬净送到国家粮食收购站。
    往年一到春耕季节，有些农民为了解决“青黄不接”的困难，不得不忍受高利贷剥削。当涂县四垾乡龙庄选区去年借高利贷的有三十六户，共借九百多万元。农民周成银去年借了两担山芋，到今秋就要还两担稻子。今年国家开展了预购工作，付给农民大量无息定金，使农民能够顺利进行春耕生产。当涂县大桥区四垾乡八百六十七家预售户，领到定金九千四百多万元，平均每户十万余元，最多的领到四十多万元。该乡桥北选区的农民将百分之五十六以上的订金购买了生产资料。当地一个互助组组长徐家友说：“我们互助组的农具坏了，正愁没有现钱修理，现在有了定金，修好农具，就可以及时开展春耕生产了。”盱眙县临城区沙岗乡的农民领到定金后，即向合作社订购了五百多件农具。
