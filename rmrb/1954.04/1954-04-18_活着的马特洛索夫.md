The Living Matrosov
Gao Yuanbai

This is a true story. The commander of this battle, Captain Xu Jixing of the Korean People's Army, personally narrated all the details of the battle to me. Since then, whenever I think of the Korean War, whenever I think of the Korean people, I think of this story, of the hero in this story. The arrival of the Korean People's Delegation to China has made this story even more moving, and I feel it is my responsibility to let more people know about it.

It was the night of January 7, 1953, on a position of the Korean People's Army on the eastern front in Korea. A team of soldiers jumped out of the tunnel and advanced rapidly to the south, led by Captain Xu Jixing. The artillery fire that had been roaring all day gradually subsided, but the wind blew harder and harder, and the snow fell heavier and heavier. This was a particularly arduous battle. In order to outflank an enemy high ground, they had to swim across a river that had not yet completely frozen, they had to climb a high mountain with almost no roads, and they had to reach the vicinity of the enemy's 565.7 high ground before dawn. They also had to hide there for a day, so that on the second night, they could attack the enemy, seize the high ground, and eliminate the threat posed by this high ground to the People's Army. Now, they set off, groping forward against the wind and snow in the pitch-black night. The wind rolled the snow, covering them head-on, and the mountain was steep and the road slippery. The snow was knee-deep in some places, and in some places they climbed up and slid down, and climbed up again after sliding down. Some soldiers were buried by the snow when they slid down, but they stood up and climbed up again. They were all as lively as dragons and tigers, as if no difficulties could exist in front of them. The Party's call at the branch meeting before departure, the resolutions and guarantees announced by each of them, constantly echoed in their minds. Finally, before dawn, they arrived at their predetermined destination—near the 565.7 high ground and hid. They used the daytime to rest while studying the battle plan to capture the high ground. As soon as it got dark, they advanced again. Their task was to climb over the 500-meter cliff of the high ground, detour to the rear of the high ground, and annihilate the enemy by surprise. It took six hours for the team to move to the rear of the high ground, which was only 200 meters away from the enemy's position. At this time, a final reconnaissance of the enemy's position was necessary before the steps of the surprise attack could be determined to ensure the victory of the battle. Captain Xu Jixing personally went to reconnoiter. He climbed to a place 30 meters away from the enemy's position and found that at the entrance of the position, there were two heavy machine gun firing points. The firing point on the right side had no communication trench connecting it to the position, which was obviously a fake. Only the firing point on the left side was real, and if this firing point was not eliminated, they would not be able to approach the position and would suffer heavy casualties. After Captain Xu Jixing reported the reconnaissance situation to the soldiers in detail, he pointed to Jin Chengzhen and three other engineering soldiers and said, "Let's give you the task of blowing up this firing point!" Jin Chengzhen stood up upon hearing the captain's order and said as if he were swearing: "Captain Comrade, I am a member of the Labor Party. For the motherland, for the Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and for world peace, I will resolutely complete the task."

Jin Chengzhen and the other three engineers set off immediately. Then, the entire team of soldiers also kept a distance of thirty or forty meters from them and climbed towards the high ground, agreeing to charge up when they heard the explosion of the first grenade. The four of them crawled, crawled, and Jin Chengzhen crawled in the front, very close to the enemy's firing point. He was worried about exposing the target and asked the other three engineers to stop moving forward. He crawled up alone. Closer, closer, the firing point could be seen very clearly. Just as he was about to throw the grenade, he slipped and fell. He grabbed a branch, but the branch was also broken. The sound alarmed the enemy sentry, and with the shout of "Who is it! Stop!" the machine gun roared in the firing point. Jin Chengzhen rushed forward a few more steps and threw the first grenade at the muzzle of the machine gun. Hearing the explosion of the grenade, the entire team of soldiers rushed up like the wind. Fifty meters, thirty meters, closer and closer. But the first grenade did not stop the enemy's machine gun from roaring, and the situation was very urgent. In this instant, the oath at the branch meeting, the captain's order, his own guarantee, the Party, Kim Il-sung, and the people of the motherland... all surged into his mind. A common people's soldier produced a great heroic act: only to hear him shout, "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" Then, with the explosion of the second grenade, he jumped sideways and pounced on the machine gun firing hole, and the flames were suppressed by him. At this time, the team of soldiers rushed up, quickly ended the battle, occupied the high ground, and eliminated a company of the enemy.

The position began to calm down. When Xu Jixing and his comrades found Jin Chengzhen, his upper body was still tightly blocking the gun hole, his right hand was still in the posture of throwing a grenade, his blood had stained the surrounding white snow red, and eleven holes had been pierced through his left armpit by the machine gun. However, his pulse had not stopped beating.

The comrades immediately carried him to the hospital. After emergency treatment, Jin Chengzhen woke up. The first sentence he said when he woke up was: "How is the battle going?" When his comrades told him: "The enemy has been eliminated, we have won!" He then felt the intense pain of the wound.

On February 8th of this year, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded Jin Chengzhen the highest honor of the Republic—the title of "Hero of the Republic."

Now, Jin Chengzhen is still in the ranks of the People's Army, continuing to fight to prevent the enemy from sabotaging the armistice and to strive for the reunification of the motherland. (Attached picture) Miao Di's illustration

    活着的马特洛索夫
    高元白
    这是一个真实的故事，指挥这次战斗的朝鲜人民军许极星中队长曾经亲自给我叙述了这次战斗的一切细节。以后，一提起朝鲜战争，一说到朝鲜人民，我就想起这个故事，想起这个故事中的英雄。由于朝鲜人民访华代表团的到来，这个故事就更加使我激动，我觉得让更多的人知道它是我的责任。
    那是一九五三年一月七日的夜晚，在朝鲜东线朝鲜人民军的一个阵地上，有一队战士，跃出坑道，向南急进，率领这队战士的就是许极星中队长。轰响了一天的炮火，逐渐稀落下去，但是风越吹越猛，雪也越下越大了。这是一次特别艰苦的战斗，为了迂回敌人的一个高地，他们要泅过还未完全结冻的江河，他们要爬过几乎没有道路的高山，他们要在天亮以前赶到敌人五六五点七高地的附近，还要在那里隐蔽一个白天，以便在第二天晚上，突击敌人，夺取高地，解除这个高地对人民军的威胁。现在，他们出发了，在伸手不见掌的黑夜中破风冒雪地摸索前进。风卷着雪，没头没脑地盖下来，山又陡，路又滑，雪下得有没膝深，有的地方他们爬上去就滑下来，滑下来又爬上去，有的战士滑下来被雪埋住，站起来又往上爬。一个个生龙活虎一样，仿佛一切困难都不能在他们面前存在似的。出发前支部大会上党的号召，他们每个人宣布的决心和保证，不断在他们的脑海里回响着。终于在拂晓以前，他们赶到预定的目的地——五六五点七高地附近隐蔽起来了。利用白天的时间一边休息，一边还在研究着攻占高地的战斗计划。天一黑，他们又前进了，他们的任务是爬过高地的五百公尺绝壁，迂回到高地的后面去，抄敌人的后路，乘虚歼灭敌人。花了六个钟头的时间，队伍总算运动到高地后面去了，这里离敌人的阵地只有二百公尺的距离。这时，必须对敌人的阵地进行一次最后的侦察，然后才能确定突袭的步骤，确保战斗的胜利。许极星中队长亲自去侦察了，他一直爬到离敌人阵地三十公尺的地方，他发现在阵地的入口处，有两个重机枪火力点，右侧的那个火力点没有和阵地联络的交通沟，显然是个假的，只有左侧的那个火力点才是真的，而就是这个火力点不消灭的话，他们就无法接近阵地，还要遭受很大伤亡。许极星中队长把侦察来的情况向战士们详细报告之后，就指着金成振和另外三个工兵同志说：“把炸毁这个火力点的任务交给你们吧！”金成振听到中队长的命令挺身而出，好像宣誓似地说：“中队长同志，我是劳动党员，为了祖国，为了党和金日成元帅，为了世界和平，我一定坚决完成任务。”
    金成振和另外三个工兵马上出发了，接着，中队全体战士也和他们保持三、四十公尺的距离向高地爬去，约好听到第一颗手榴弹的爆炸声就冲上去。他们四个人爬着，爬着，金成振爬在最前面，离敌人的火力点很近了，他耽心暴露目标，要另外三个工兵停止前进，他一个爬了上去。近了，近了，火力点已经看得很清楚了，他正准备扔出手榴弹时，不防脚一滑，溜下来了。他顺手抓住一根树枝，不料树枝也被拉断了。响声惊动了敌人的哨兵，随着“谁呀！站住！”的叫喊，火力点里爆发了机枪的吼声。金成振又抢前爬了几步，就对准机枪发射的火口抛出了第一个手榴弹。听到手榴弹的爆炸，中队全体战士风也似地冲了上来，五十公尺了，三十公尺了，越来越近了。可是第一个手榴弹还没有使敌人的机枪停止怪叫，情况十分紧急。在这一刹那间，支部大会上的誓言，中队长的命令，自己的保证，党、金日成以及祖国人民……一起在他的脑海里涌现出来。一个普通的人民战士就产生了伟大的英雄行为：只听得他在高喊：“金日成元帅万岁！”接着第二个手榴弹的爆炸，他侧面纵身一跃，扑在机枪射口之上，火舌被他压住了。这时，中队战士冲了上来，很快结束了战斗，占领了高地，消灭了一个中队的敌人。
    阵地开始沉静下来。当许极星和战友们发现金成振时，他的上身还死死地堵在枪眼上，右手还在做着投弹的姿势，他的鲜血已经染红了周围的白雪，左腋下被机枪打穿了十一个洞，不过，脉搏还没有停止跳动。
    战友们马上把他抬到医院，经过急救，金成振苏醒过来了。他醒来的第一句话就是：“仗打得怎么样？”当战友们告诉他：“消灭了敌人，胜利了！”时，他才感到伤口的剧痛。
    今年二月八日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会授予金成振以共和国最高荣誉——“共和国英雄”的称号。
    现在，金成振还在人民军的行列里为防止敌人破坏停战，为争取祖国统一而继续战斗着。（附图片）苗地插图
