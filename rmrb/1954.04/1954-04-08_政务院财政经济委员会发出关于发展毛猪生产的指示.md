Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: Due to the increase in the urban and industrial population, and the improvement of farmers' lives, the consumption of meat by urban and rural residents has greatly increased. At present, the sales volume of pork is increasing across the country. In 1953, domestic pork consumption increased by 10% compared to 1952, with an increase of 20% in the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. It is estimated that the sales volume of meat during this year's Spring Festival increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year. In order to increase hog production, solve the contradiction between meat supply and demand, expand fertilizer sources, promote increased agricultural production, and increase farmers' sideline income, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government State Council has issued instructions on developing hog production.

The instructions require local people's governments to strengthen leadership in hog production and increase hog production. Based on the supply and demand of hogs and pig raising conditions, production tasks should be stipulated according to the needs of the state and local areas, specific difficulties should be resolved, and the hog raising plan of the Central Ministry of Agriculture should be guaranteed. In areas where commercial pigs are raised, feed should be adjusted in a planned way, requiring further development, and at least maintaining the original number of pigs raised. In areas where feed is not lacking and there are fewer pigs, appropriate development can be carried out as needed. In areas where there is no habit of raising pigs (except for ethnic minority areas), pig raising can be promoted. Especially in areas near large cities and with convenient transportation and pig raising conditions, the agricultural sector should organize a large number of pig raising industries and establish new pig source bases. State-owned farms, forest farms, and ranches should include pig raising in their production tasks, and agricultural experiment stations should promote improved pig breeds and breed them for the masses. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups should be organized to raise a large number of pigs, formulate pig raising plans, and mobilize the majority of farmers to raise pigs in every household. Organs, troops, and schools living in the suburbs of small and medium-sized cities and in rural areas can be encouraged to use discarded food to raise pigs, provided that hygiene is not affected. Agricultural departments should provide appropriate rewards and care for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups that raise more pigs and more sows. Food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives should sign contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to supply bran, guarantee the sale of hogs, or pre-purchase contracts to support hog production.

The instructions state that in order to open up sources of pig feed in many ways and strengthen the supply and adjustment of feed, it is necessary to actively educate farmers to use bean cake and oil cake for fertilizing fields to feed pigs and accumulate fertilizer. The amount of oil cake produced nationwide is very large, and most of it can be used as livestock feed. If farmers can be mobilized and educated to change the habit of applying cake fertilizer directly to the land, tens of millions of fat pigs can be fed. By doing so, the fertilizer efficiency will not be reduced, which can solve the difficulty of insufficient feed, and avoid the harm of oil cake fat to crops, making phosphorus and nitrogen more easily absorbed by crops.

Pigs are omnivorous animals, and there are many items that can be used as feed. Generally, wild grass, pond weeds, vegetables, wild fruits, leaves, stems and leaves of melons, vegetables, and taro, silage corn stalks, and sweet potato vines and leaves can all be used to feed pigs. These green feeds contain a large amount of protein, vitamins, and carbohydrates, and are comprehensively nutritious, which can promote the development of piglets and increase the fattening speed of large pigs. Local pig raising experience and scientific evidence show that pigs grow faster when fed with green feed than with grain alone. There are many types of green feed, and the masses should be mobilized to collect them in large quantities.

In areas where pigs are concentrated, pig vegetables can be sown on the edges of fields. According to climate, soil, and other natural conditions, a certain amount of high-yielding feed crops and green manure crops such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, radishes, barnyard grass, alfalfa, sweet vetch, milk vetch, and purple cloud clover should be planted as needed to raise pigs. And strengthen the feeding management of hogs, pay attention to the proper preparation of feed, and use fermentation and germination feed preparation methods according to local conditions. Research and summarize the experience of the masses in using substitute foods to raise pigs, actively promote it, and ensure increased pig production. The instructions pointed out that local grain departments should adjust and supply bran nearby to maintain and develop hog production. First of all, it is necessary to meet the needs of key pig-producing areas, areas near large cities, and areas with convenient transportation. Surplus bran should be transferred to secondary areas. Grain processing factories should sign supply and sales contracts with cooperatives to quickly organize bran to go to the countryside and resell it to pig farmers who lack feed as soon as possible. In key pig-producing areas, if farmers feel that their pig feed is insufficient, the grain department should appropriately sell a part of miscellaneous grains through the supply and marketing cooperative to adjust pig feed. The state has decided to allocate 1.29 billion catties of miscellaneous grains and oil cake to support the pig-raising industry in key areas. Localities can appropriately sell a part of miscellaneous grains within the scope that does not affect the planned sales of grain, according to specific circumstances, to maintain the production of side businesses such as flour mills and tofu workshops. Publicly owned sugar factories, oil factories, distilleries, and food workshops of supply and marketing cooperatives can use distiller's grains, sugar residues, and powder residues to run their own pig farms, and should actively support the pig raising industry and give priority to supplying pig feed to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups.

Reward the feeding of excellent breeding boars, select pig breeds that mature early, grow fast, save feed, have strong vitality, and have good meat quality according to local conditions, promote hybridization methods, carry out key improvements, improve the quality of hogs, and strive to meet market needs and export specifications.

The instructions believe that it is very important to strengthen the prevention and control of pig infectious diseases. The policy of "prevention is more important than treatment" should be implemented, the masses should be mobilized and organized, feeding management should be strengthened, having pigs and pens should be promoted, attention should be paid to environmental hygiene, and in areas with pigpox, improvement of Lian Mao Pens should be promoted so that toilets and pigpens are separated to prevent insect eggs from entering the pig's body. When infectious diseases occur, the epidemic situation should be reported in a timely manner, sick pigs should be isolated, thorough disinfection of pig houses should be carried out, and the masses should be educated to organize livestock protection groups, establish covenants, and abide by them together to prevent the spread of the epidemic. Drug prevention and treatment must be carried out in epidemic areas. And promote the effective methods of the masses to improve the therapeutic effect. At present, there are few veterinary prevention and control personnel and the technical level is low. It is necessary to train grassroots cadres, unite and improve local veterinarians, impart technology, and mobilize the masses to prevent and control pig infectious diseases.

The instructions finally require strengthening the adjustment of pork. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperative departments should strengthen the planned supply of hogs and meat, expand the scope of hog purchases to remote areas with inconvenient transportation, set up factories to process and make ham, bacon, preserved meat, lard, etc., pack them in boxes and transport them out to stimulate the local masses to increase pig production and make up for the shortage of meat supply in cities.

    政务院财政经济委员会发出关于发展毛猪生产的指示
    【新华社七日讯】由于城市和工矿区人口增加，农民生活改善，城乡居民食肉量大增。目前全国各地猪肉销售量日益增加。一九五三年国内猪肉消费量比一九五二年增加百分之十，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州五大城市增加百分之二十，今年春节比去年同期销肉量估计增加百分之三十以上。为增加毛猪生产，解决肉食供求矛盾，扩大肥料来源，促进农业增产，增加农民副业收入，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会特发出关于发展毛猪生产的指示。
    指示要求各地人民政府加强对毛猪生产的领导，增加毛猪生产。根据毛猪供求情况和养猪条件，按国家和当地需要，规定生产任务，解决具体困难，保证完成中央农业部的养猪计划。在养商品猪的地区应有计划地调剂饲料，要求进一步发展，至少维持原有养猪数量。在饲料不缺猪只较少地区可根据需要适当发展。在无养猪习惯地区（少数民族地区除外），可提倡养猪。特别在大城市附近和交通方便具有养猪条件的地区，农业部门应大量组织养猪业，建立新的猪源基地。国营农场、林场、牧场应将养猪列入生产任务，农业试验场应推广优良猪种，为群众养猪配种。组织农业生产合作社、互助组大量养猪，制订养猪计划并动员广大农民家家养猪。住在中小城市近郊和农村的机关部队、学校，在不影响卫生的原则下，可提倡利用废弃食品养猪。对多养猪和多养母猪的农业生产合作社、互助组，应由农业部门给予适当奖励和照顾，食品公司、供销合作社要与农业生产合作社、互助组订立供应糠麸、包销毛猪或预购合同，扶持毛猪生产。
    指示说，为了多方面开辟猪食来源，加强饲料的供应调剂工作，必须积极教育农民采取肥田的各种豆饼、油饼喂猪积肥。全国所产油饼数量很大，且大部可作牲畜饲料，如能动员教育农民，改变用饼肥直接上地的习惯，可喂成肥猪数千万只。这样做，肥效不会减少，既可解决饲料不足的困难，又可避免饼肥油脂对作物的危害，使磷素、氮素更易被作物吸收。
    猪是杂食性动物，可作饲料的物品很多。一般野生草、池塘水草、青菜、野果、树叶、瓜菜芋艿的茎叶、青贮玉米秸秆和红薯藤叶等，大都可以喂猪。这些青饲料多含有大量蛋白质、维他命及炭水化合物，养分全面，可以促进小猪各部发育，增加大猪的育肥速度。各地养猪经验和科学证明，用青饲料喂猪，猪的成长比单用粮食来的快，青饲种类很多，应发动群众大量采集。
    在猪只集中地区，可利用田头地边播种猪菜，根据气候、土壤等自然条件，按照需要种植一定数量的红薯、马铃薯、萝卜、稗子、苜蓿草、苕子、金花菜、紫云英等多产饲料作物和绿肥作物，用以养猪。并加强毛猪的饲养管理，注意饲料适当调制，根据各地条件利用发酵发芽饲料调制法。研究和总结群众利用代食品养猪经验，积极加以推广，保证猪只增产。指示指出，各地粮食部门应就近调剂和供应糠麸，维持和发展毛猪生产。首先是满足重点产猪地区，大城市附近和交通方便地区，有剩余糠麸再调剂次要地区。粮食加工厂应与合作社签订供销合同，迅速组织糠麸下乡，尽先转售给缺乏饲料的养猪户。在重点产猪区，农民的猪饲料如感不足，应由粮食部门通过供销合作社适当出售一部杂粮调剂猪食，国家已决定拨出杂粮和油饼十二亿九千万斤扶持重点地区养猪业。各地可按具体情况在不影响粮食计划销售范围内，酌量出售一部杂粮维持粉坊、豆腐坊等副业生产。公营的糖坊、油坊、糟坊及供销合作社的副食品作坊可利用酒糟、糖渣、粉渣等自办养猪场，并应主动扶持养猪业，尽先供应农业生产合作社和互助组的养猪饲料。
    奖励喂养优良种公畜，根据当地条件选择成熟早、长肉快、省饲料而又生活力强和肉质良好的猪种，提倡杂交方法，进行重点改良，提高毛猪品质，力求合乎市场需要与出口规格。
    指示认为加强猪传染病的防治工作是很重要的，应贯彻防重于治的方针，发动和组织群众，加强饲养管理，提倡有猪有圈，注意环境卫生，有猪痘的地区提倡改善连茅圈，使厕所和猪圈分开，防止螩虫卵进入猪体。传染病发生时，要及时报告疫情，隔离病猪，实施猪舍彻底消毒，教育群众组织护畜小组，订立公约，共同遵守，以防疫情传染扩大。在疫区必须进行药物防治。并推广群众行之有效的办法，以提高治疗效果。目前兽医防治人员少，技术水平低，必须训练基层干部，团结与提高地方兽医，传授技术，发动群众防治猪的传染病。
    指示最后要求加强猪肉的调剂工作。国营商业部门和供销合作社部门应加强对毛猪与肉食计划供应工作，到边远交通不便地区扩大收购毛猪面，设厂加工制成火腿、咸肉、腊肉、猪油等，装箱外运，以刺激当地群众猪只增产且可弥补城市肉食供应的不足。
