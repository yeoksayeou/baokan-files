    Southwest Region Completes Population Survey and Registration of Over 70 Million People
    Population of Emerging Forestry City Yichun County in Northeast Region is Growing Rapidly
    The population survey and registration work in the Southwest Region is nearing its conclusion. As of March 20th, the population survey and registration work has been completed in areas with over 76.5 million people. The election committees and population survey offices in these areas have mostly conducted reviews of the population survey and registration work. In Ba County, Sichuan Province, the clerks of each township (the main technical cadres of the townships) were first concentrated for training before conducting the review. In Chongqing City, where there is a large floating population, after the population survey and registration was completed, multiple rounds of sampling and review were conducted to ensure that the accuracy of the survey reached over 99%. Xikang Province, which completed the general election earlier, also carefully reviewed and checked the comprehensive statistical tables of the population survey of ten counties in the province.
    During the population survey and registration and review process, various methods were adopted to avoid hindering mass production and to facilitate the masses. In many areas, the population survey and registration work was combined with the publicity and education of the general line, mobilizing the broad masses to actively assist in carrying out this work. In the jurisdiction of the Liujia Tai police station in the Second District of Chongqing City, 149 female activists actively publicized and assisted in the population survey and registration, enabling the local voter registration work to be completed quickly and accurately.

    The results of the population survey and registration conducted recently in the famous emerging forestry city of Yichun County show the prosperous scene of this city. The current permanent population of the county is 177,058, an increase of more than 72% compared to January last year, and five times more than in 1948. By the end of the population survey and registration, more than 72,000 family members of workers had settled here; young workers have also married and started families, and in the past year, 1,361 pairs of young male and female workers registered their marriages. Due to the rapid development of medical and health services in the forest area and the unfolding of the patriotic health campaign, the number of people getting sick and dying among the county's residents has greatly decreased, and the infant birth rate has greatly increased. Currently, the county averages more than 280 newborns per month. There are 10,288 children under the age of one on the population survey and registration forms.
    People have developed a love for this emerging forestry city, because the social landscape here has undergone tremendous changes, and the material and cultural life of the workers has gradually improved. Before 1948, Yichun County had only three to five households besides the staff of the forestry bureau and a company of soldiers. Since the establishment of the Yichun County People's Government at the end of 1952, it has become more and more prosperous day by day. The number of outsiders has continued to increase, and the local population is also growing rapidly. The county has built more than 176,000 square meters of family dormitories for workers, and has also established 98 state-owned store branches and cooperatives, selling more than 3,000 kinds of general merchandise, local specialties, and non-staple foods. Silk fabrics produced in Shanghai and wool serge produced in Shenyang are warmly welcomed by workers and residents. The county has 33 primary schools and one middle school, as well as a forestry cadre school. Currently, more than 11,000 children of workers have the opportunity to attend school, and more than 2,400 workers and their families have participated in 49 winter schools and literacy classes.

    西南区完成七千多万人口的调查登记工作
    东北区新兴林业城市伊春县人口日益兴旺
    西南区人口调查登记工作已临近结束阶段。截至三月二十日止，已有七千六百五十多万人口的地区完成了人口调查登记工作。这些地区的选举委员会和人口调查办公室大都对人口调查登记工作进行了复查。四川省巴县先将各乡的文书（乡的主要技术干部）集中训练后，再进行复查。流动人口较多的重庆市，在人口调查登记完毕后，经过多次的抽查和复查，使调查的准确程度达到了百分之九十九以上。完成普选较早的西康省，还将该省十个县的人口调查综合统计表，进行了认真的审核和查对。
    各地在进行人口调查登记和复查时，采取了不妨碍群众生产和便利群众的多种多样的方法进行。很多地区的人口调查登记工作结合总路线的宣传教育进行，动员了广大群众积极协助进行这项工作。重庆市第二区刘家台派出所辖区内就有一百四十九个妇女积极分子向群众宣传并协助人口调查登记，使当地选民登记工作迅速准确地完成。

    不久以前在著名的新兴林业城市——伊春县进行人口调查登记的结果，显示出这座城市的兴旺景象。现在全县常住人口共有十七万七千零五十八名，比去年一月增加了百分之七十二以上，比一九四八年增加了五倍。到人口调查登记结束时，全县有七万二千多职工家属在这里定居；青年工人们也都成家立业，在过去一年里，登记结婚的青年男女职工有一千三百六十一对。由于林区的医药卫生事业有了飞跃的发展和爱国卫生运动的展开，全县居民中生病的人和死亡的人都大大减少，婴儿出生率大大增加。现在，全县平均每月有新生婴儿二百八十多名。在人口调查登记表上的一岁以下幼儿有一万零二百八十八名。
    人们对这个新兴的林业城市发生了热爱，因为这里的社会面貌发生了巨大的变化，工人的物质和文化生活也逐步提高。一九四八年以前的伊春县，除了林务所的职工和一个连的战士外，只有三五家住户。从一九五二年底建立了伊春县人民政府以后，这里就一天比一天繁荣。外来人员不断增加，本地人口也日益兴旺。全县为工人建筑的家属宿舍有十七万六千多平方公尺，还设立了九十八处国营商店的门市部和合作社、出售的百货和各种土、特产品和副食品共有三千多种。上海出产的绢丝呢、绢纹呢和沈阳出产的毛哔叽等，受到职工和居民的热烈欢迎。全县有三十三所小学和一所中学，还有一所林业干部学校。目前有一万一千多名职工子弟得到升学机会，还有二千四百多工人和家属参加了四十九处冬学和识字班学习。　（新华社）
