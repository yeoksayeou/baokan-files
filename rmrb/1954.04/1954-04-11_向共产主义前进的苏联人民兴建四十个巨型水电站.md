The Soviet people, marching towards communism, are building forty giant hydropower stations on major rivers in Europe and Asia within the Soviet Union.

Near Molotov City in the Western Urals, the first section of the hydropower station on the Kama River will generate electricity in the third quarter of this year, and the locks will be open to navigation after the spring flood. The reservoir will be filled in April. All kinds of work are mechanized, with excavators, cranes, bulldozers, dump trucks, and dredgers humming everywhere. On average, thirteen horsepower of machinery is allocated to each construction worker on the site.

The first section of the Gorky Hydropower Station near Gorky City will also begin generating electricity this year. Currently, a magnificent scene unfolds on the left bank of the Volga River construction site. Especially at night, amidst a sea of lights, the power plant, spillway, locks, and canal structures appear particularly beautiful. The speed of the project's progress increases monthly. Currently, workers are intensifying their efforts to complete preparations for blocking the Volga River's flow in September.

The Narva Hydropower Station in Estonia is being built fifteen kilometers from the mouth of the Narva River, before the famous Narva Falls. Here, the turbulent water flows down from a height of ten meters, generating tremendous power. On the construction site, the most laborious earthwork for water retaining dams, power plant foundation pits, spillway foundation pits, and diversion canals are being successively completed. Builders are working day and night, and they have decided to complete the first part of the dam before the spring flood and begin the second part after the spring flood.

The first giant hydropower station on the Angara River in Siberia is being successfully built near Irkutsk. The power generation of this hydropower station will be twice as large as that of the largest European Dnipro Hydropower Station. Workers are completing the first phase of the project. A steel pile wall and earth dam have spanned the Angara River. Concrete factories, repair factories, lumber factories, as well as residential buildings and cultural and educational institutions have been established. By late February, more than five thousand people on the construction site had completed over one hundred and twenty percent of their tasks.

Latest Record of the Largest Steel Plant

The Soviet Union's largest Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works has broken metallurgical industry conventions and created various new labor records. The plant's blast furnace workers have fully mastered the use of self-cultivated sintered ore to produce pig iron. According to the theory of American metallurgists, if the proportion of sintered ore in iron ore exceeds 45 percent, the smelting of pig iron will become complicated and prolonged. However, the plant's blast furnace workers have been able to use ore sand with a sintered lump ratio of more than 90 percent to refine iron, and also greatly strengthen the production process. In the production process, blast furnace workers increased the blast temperature, used high-pressure blast furnace gas, and mastered airflow management, thereby greatly increasing pig iron production. For example, after using these methods in the plant's No. 3 blast furnace, it has been able to refine one ton of pig iron from an effective furnace volume of 0.637 cubic meters, while the best steel plant in the United States last year refined one ton of pig iron from more than one cubic meter.

The plant's steelmaking workers have also created amazing records. For example, the No. 2 open hearth furnace produced 9.25 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom area last year (the best steel plant in the United States is 5.3 tons), and over-produced a total of 19,000 tons of steel. In terms of extending furnace life, the plant's workers have enabled open hearth furnaces with chrome-magnesite brick tops to refine more than 400 heats of steel per furnace lifespan, compared to 150 to 200 heats in the past. The plant's chief engineer, Lerenko, and others recently also planned a rapid overhaul method for open hearth furnaces, which can shorten the downtime for each repair by two days and greatly increase steel production.

In the rolling mill, the staff of the control measurement instrument and automatic machine workshop automated the operation of the No. 2 primary rolling mill. The operator's job is now just to pay attention to the movement of the instruments. In this sense, the plant's primary rolling mill is now unparalleled in the world.

Moscow Builds New Underground Railway Line

Construction of Moscow's fifth underground railway line has begun. Preparations are now underway to excavate the new 12-kilometer-long tunnel.

The fifth underground railway line will extend in two directions. The first one, called the Frunze Line, will run from the Gorky Central Culture and Recreation Park Station to the new campus of Moscow University on Lenin Hills, with a total of five stations. The second one, called the Shcherbakov Line, will lead to the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, with a total of four stations.

A TASS reporter learned from the Underground Railway Construction Bureau that the tunnel excavation work for these two new lines will be carried out in very poor geological conditions. It is necessary to sink shafts through several meters of quicksand. Powerful pumping stations are being installed to remove groundwater. Many new technical equipment will be used in the construction of the fifth underground railway line, including a mechanized high-speed tunnel boring machine.

More Varieties and Better Designs of Daily Necessities

While increasing the production of daily necessities, the variety, patterns, and styles of products are also being expanded and improved. The Soviet Union has designed more than 5,000 new clothing styles for this year, more than 3,500 shoe styles, including 2,000 spring and summer shoes, 800 new silk patterns, and more than 200 wool patterns. The art designers of the All-Union Sample House in Moscow design more than 200 fashion styles every month for clothing factories to adopt. The mansion recently held a spring and summer fashion exhibition, displaying 250 kinds of spring and summer fashions produced by Moscow clothing factories. The Soviet Ministry of Daily Necessities Industry also recently held a textile exhibition, displaying 1,000 product styles produced by two major enterprises, the Tashkent United Textile Factory and the Barnaul Textile Factory, including dazzling Oriental textiles, colorful printed cloth, new-style imitation satin, and cotton fabrics. In addition, the Soviet Ministry of Daily Necessities Industry also held a spring and summer new style shoe exhibition in February this year, exhibiting new products from 60 major shoe factories across the country.

Spring Comes to the Crimean Resort Area

Spring has arrived in the resort area on the southern coast of Crimea in the Soviet Union. Palatial sanatoriums and resorts hidden in the gardens are eagerly receiving spring vacationers from all directions. Every day, more than 300 guests arrive by train and car. After working hard for a winter, people come here to enjoy the warm sunshine and fresh air, and admire the beautiful scenery.

Crimea's sanatorium institutions are constantly expanding and renovating. The Soviet trade union organization established a large mineral spring sanatorium with 450 beds here at the end of last year. A new sanatorium built by the working people of Belarus has been opened. A sanatorium for electrical workers has also been reopened after major renovations. In Yalta, the construction of buildings, clubs, and canteens of the "Bolshevik" Sanatorium and the "Metallurgical Worker" Sanatorium is also nearing completion. In addition, more new sanatorium institutions will be built for young vacationers in Artek, a famous children's resort.

While expanding and building new sanatorium institutions, a large hotel that can accommodate 500 people is being built in Yalta, Crimea, which is near the sea. Construction of cafes, public canteens, and shops has begun in Gurzuf, Simeiz, Alupka, and Miskhore. The establishment of these trade organizations will further meet the living requirements of vacationers and make their lives more enjoyable and comfortable during their vacation.

Close Contact Between Universities and Middle Schools

Soviet universities are preparing for the admissions work for the next academic year.

The Bauman Higher Technical School - one of Moscow's oldest engineering colleges - held an "Open Day". Hundreds of middle school students visited the school's auditorium and laboratories on this day. The school's professors and teachers introduced the industries that can be studied here to the visiting students, accompanied them to visit the school, and instructed them to see some of the latest equipment, which enables teaching to be based on the latest achievements in science and technology.

The tradition of "Open Days" in Soviet colleges and universities gives middle school graduates a clearer concept of various professions and helps them decide which school to enter.

Soviet universities and secondary schools maintain close ties. One of the forms of this connection is to organize competitions for students in grades seven to ten. A few days ago, Moscow University held the first round of a mathematics competition. More than 700 middle school students participated in the competition, answering questions given to them by university professors. This competition will not end until April 25. Through this competition, it can be known who has the most mathematical talent, and then university scholars will help them develop in this area.

Universities in Moscow, Leningrad, Kazan, and many other cities also regularly hold competitions in physics, chemistry, astronomy, history, and biology for middle school students. Thousands of middle school students participate in such competitions. This also helps them choose a career. (Xinhua News Agency)

    向共产主义前进的苏联人民兴建四十个巨型水电站
    苏联境内欧洲和亚洲各大河流上正在兴建四十个巨型水电站。
    在西乌拉尔莫洛托夫城附近，卡马河上的水电站第一部分将在今年第三季发电，水闸在春汛后就要开航。四月间水库就要灌水了。各种工作都机械化了，挖掘机、起重机、开路机、自卸卡车、汲泥机等到处轰鸣。工地上平均每一建筑工人可分配十三匹马力的机器。
    高尔基城附近的高尔基水电站第一部分也将在今年开始发电。目前伏尔加河左岸工地展开了一片壮丽景象。尤其是晚上，在一片灯光之海中，电力厂、溢洪道、水闸、渠道等建筑显得分外美丽。工程进展速度每月都在提高。目前工人们正加紧努力，他们将在九月完成堵住伏尔加河水流的准备工作。
    爱沙尼亚的纳瓦水电站，建筑在离纳瓦河入海口十五公里的著名的纳瓦瀑布之前。这里，汹涌的水流由十公尺高的地方倾泻而下，产生巨大的动力。工地上拒水堰、电力厂基坑、溢洪道基坑、引水渠等最费力的土方工作正陆续完成。建筑者们夜以继日地工作着，他们决定在春汛前完成堤坝第一部分，在春汛后开始第二部分的建筑工作。
    西伯利亚的安加拉河上第一座巨型水电站正在伊尔库次克附近顺利兴建着。这座水电站的发电量将比欧洲最大的第聂伯水电站还大一倍。工人们正在完成第一期工程。一道钢桩墙和土坝已横跨安加拉河。混凝土工厂、修理工厂、木材工厂及住宅、文教机构已建立起来。到二月下旬，工地上有五千多人完成任务百分之一百二十以上。
    最大钢铁厂的最新纪录
    苏联最大的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂打破冶金工业中的陈规，创造了各种新的劳动纪录。该厂高炉工人已完全掌握利用自培烧结矿来生产铣铁。根据美国冶金学家的理论，铁矿中烧结块比重超过百分之四十五，冶炼铣铁工作就要复杂并且延长。而该厂高炉工人已能利用烧结块比重占百分之九十以上的矿砂炼铁，而且还使生产过程极其强化。在生产过程中，高炉工人提高鼓风温度、利用高压高炉煤气并掌握气流管理，因而大大提高了铣铁产量。例如该厂三号高炉利用这些方法后，已能从高炉有效容积○·六三七立方公尺炼出一吨铣铁，而美国去年最好的钢铁厂，每一立方公尺以上才炼出一吨铣铁。
    该厂炼钢工人也创造了惊人纪录。例如二号平炉去年使每一平方公尺的炉底面积生产九点二五吨钢（美国最好的钢铁厂是五点三吨），共超额炼出了
  一万九千吨钢。在延长炉龄方面，该厂工人使铬镁砖炉顶的平炉每一炉龄期可炼四百炉以上的钢，而过去是一百五十炉到二百炉。该厂总技师勒仁科等最近还计划了一种平炉快速大修法，可使每次修理停工期缩短两昼夜，大大增加了钢产量。
    在轧钢车间，控制量度仪表和自动机器车间的工作人员使二号初轧机操纵工作自动化了。操纵员的工作现在只是注意仪表的运动。就这个意义来说，该厂的初轧机现在是举世无匹的。
      莫斯科建筑新地下电车道
    莫斯科第五条地下电车道的建筑工作已开始了。开凿长达十二公里的新隧道的准备工作现在正在进行。
    第五条地下电车道将向两个方向伸展。其中的第一条，叫伏龙芝线，它将从高尔基中央文化休憩公园站到列宁山上的莫斯科大学新校舍，共五个站。第二条叫谢巴科夫线，它将通到苏联农业展览会，共四个站。
    塔斯社记者自地下电车道建筑局获悉，这两条新路线的隧道开凿工作要在条件很坏的地层中进行。必须通过几公尺厚的流沙来凿井。效力强大的抽水站正在安装抽去地下水的设备。第五条地下电车道的建筑工作中将使用许多新的技术设备，其中包括一种机械化的高速隧道挖掘机。
      日用品的种类更多花样更好
    和提高日用品产量的同时，产品的种类、花色和式样也正在扩大和改进。苏联为今年设计的新服装式样已有五千多种，鞋类式样有三千五百多种，其中春夏季鞋类二千种，丝织品新花样有八百种，毛织品有二百多种。莫斯科的全苏货样大厦的美术设计师每月设计二百多种时装式样供服装工厂采用。该大厦最近举办了一个春夏季时装展览会，展出了莫斯科各服装工厂出品的春夏季时装二百五十种。苏联日用品工业部最近也举办了纺织品展览会，展出了塔什干联合纺织厂和巴尔瑙尔纺织工厂两大企业生产的一千种产品式样，其中有鲜艳夺目的东方纺织品、彩色印花布、新式假缎和棉织品。此外，苏联日用品工业部今年二月间还举办了一个春夏季新式样鞋类展览会，展出了全国六十个大制鞋工厂的新出品。
    春到克里米亚休养地区
    春天已降临到苏联克里米亚南部海岸的休养地区。隐没在园林深处的宫殿似的疗养院和休养所，正在殷切地接待着来自四面八方的春季休养者。每天，火车、汽车载来的客人有三百多人。人们在辛勤地劳动了一个冬季之后，到这里尽情地享受着温暖的阳光和清新的空气，观赏绮丽的风景。
    克里米亚的疗养机构正在不断扩充和改建。苏联工会组织去年年底在这里设立了一所有四百五十个床位的大矿泉疗养院。白俄罗斯劳动人民的一所新建的疗养院已经开放。电气工人的一所疗养院经过大加修缮之后也重新开放。在雅尔塔，“布尔什维克”疗养院和“冶金工人”疗养院的大厦、俱乐部和食堂等建筑工程，也接近完成了。此外，还要在有名的儿童疗养地阿尔台克为少年休养者建造更多的新的疗养机构。
      和扩建新的疗养机构同时，在克里米亚临海的雅尔塔正在建造一所能容纳五百人的大饭店。在古尔祖夫、西米兹、阿路波卡和米斯赫尔等地已开始建筑咖啡店、公共食堂和商店的房屋。这些贸易机构的设立将进一步满足休养者的生活上的要求，使他们在休养期间生活得更愉快、更舒适。
    高等学校和中学的密切联系
    苏联的高等学校已在准备下一个学年的招生工作了。
    包曼高级技术学校——莫斯科历史最悠久的工程学院之一——举行了一个“开放日”。数百个中学学生在这一天参观了该校的大礼堂和实验室。该校教授和教员向参观的学生介绍在这里可以学到的行业，陪他们参观学校，指示他们看一些最新式的设备，这些设备使得教学能够在科学与技术的最新成就的基础上进行。
    苏联各学院和大学的“开放日”的传统，使得中学毕业生对于各种职业有较明确的概念，并且帮助他们决定进什么学校。
    苏联高等学校和中等学校保持着密切的联系。这种联系的形式之一，便是组织七年级到十年级学生的各项比赛。几天以前，莫斯科大学举行了数学比赛的第一轮。有七百多名中学生参加了这次比赛，解答大学教授们给他们出的题目。这次比赛要到四月二十五日才结束。通过这次比赛，可以知道谁最有数学天才，然后由大学学者们帮助他们在这方面发展。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、喀山和许多其他城市的高等学校也经常举行中学生的物理、化学、天文、历史和生物方面的比赛。成千上万的中学生参加了这种比赛。这也有助于他们选择职业。（据新华社讯）
