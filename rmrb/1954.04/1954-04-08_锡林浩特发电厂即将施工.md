Construction preparations for the Xilinhot (also known as Beizi Temple) Power Plant in the Xilin Gol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are largely complete. Construction is expected to begin in May, installation in June, and formal power generation on October 1st.

With the enthusiastic support of the herdsmen, the preparatory personnel of the Xilinhot Power Plant actively overcame difficulties and carried out preparations for the plant's construction. They crossed deserts and grasslands to transport two 240-kilowatt generators shipped from Shanghai to Xilinhot, and transported large quantities of bricks, lime, cement, steel bars, hardware, etc., from Tongliao, Chifeng, Dashiqiao, and other places to the construction site. The material transportation plan has been completed on schedule.

The establishment of this power plant will bring light and prosperity to the naturally rich pasture of the Xilin Gol League. In the past, because the Xilin Gol League had no processing plants, the herdsmen had to travel thousands of miles every year, using camels to transport locally produced wool and hides to Duolun, Zhangjiakou, and other places for processing; then, they used camels to transport the processed felt, wool, and leather boots back. With the establishment of the power plant, felt factories, leather factories, wool mills, dairy processing plants, etc., will appear successively on the Xilin Gol League grassland. At that time, the main daily necessities of the herdsmen here will no longer need to be transported from distant places, and the processed leather, felt, wool, dairy products, etc., will be continuously transported to all parts of the motherland.

    锡林浩特发电厂即将施工
    内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟锡林浩特（即贝子庙）发电厂的施工准备工作已大体就绪，预计五月份开始施工，六月安装，十月一日将正式发电。
    锡林浩特发电厂的筹备人员在牧民们的热情支援下，积极克服困难，进行了建厂准备工作。他们越过沙漠和草原，把从上海起运的两部二百四十瓩的发电机运到锡林浩特，把大批砖、石灰、水泥、钢筋、五金等从通辽、赤峰、大石寨等地运到施工现场。器材运输计划已按期完成。
    这个发电厂的建立，将给水草丰美的锡林郭勒盟天然牧场带来光明和繁荣。过去，由于锡林郭勒盟没有加工厂，牧民们年年要经过千里的途程，把当地出产的羊毛、皮子用骆驼运到多伦、张家口等地去加工；然后，再用骆驼把加工后的毡子、毛绒、牛皮靴等运回来。随着发电厂的建立，锡林郭勒盟草原上将会陆续出现制毡厂、制革厂、毛织厂、奶品加工厂等。那时候，这里的牧民们的主要生活用品，便可以不需要从遥远的地方去驮运，而且，这里加工的皮革、毡子、羊毛、奶食等，还将源源地输送到祖国各地。
