    The "Larousse Encyclopedia" is re-published every year in Paris. This dictionary is used by elementary school students, academicians, farmers who don't trust their own handwriting, crossword puzzle enthusiasts, and members of parliament who prepare speeches by quoting classical works. It can be said that this is the most popular book in France, serving more than one generation. Of course, many things in this reference book have changed: new social systems have emerged, scientists' inventions have enriched the world, some words have been created, and some words are dying out. However, some truths can be found both in the first edition of the "Larousse Dictionary" a long time ago and in the most recent edition: a cow is a ruminant, Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, and Newton invented the law of universal gravitation. Whether in the first or the most recent edition of the "Larousse Dictionary," there is the following entry:
   “Europe has vast lands, bordered by the Arctic Ocean in the north, the Atlantic Ocean in the west, the Mediterranean Sea and its associated rivers in the south, as well as the Caucasus Mountains, and the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea in the east. Southern Caucasus and Iceland are also usually included in Europe.”
    I believe that French politicians generally have this elementary geographical knowledge, and the "Larousse Dictionary" is also serving them. If any of them doubt where Europe starts and ends, it should be blamed on American fantasies, not on French middle schools.
    In fact, we can now see that some politicians are very rashly trying to change the boundaries of the continents. One often reads news like this: the border of Europe is on the Oder River or even the Elbe River. All sorts of Europes have appeared: now it is the "coal and steel" Europe, now it is the "Strasbourg" Europe, and now it is the "defense group" Europe; sometimes a quarter of the European countries participate in these alliances, sometimes a fifth. This does not prevent those inventors who arbitrarily divide "Europe" into various forms from repeatedly insisting that their union represents Europe, representing that great continent known for civilization - the real Europe.
    The journalists from various countries who came to Berlin during the Foreign Ministers' Conference were very surprised by the life of this city: they had two Berlins in front of them. The French couldn't help but wonder what Paris would be like if Montmartre and Montparnasse were separated by a boundary line. It is difficult for the British to imagine London coveting Hempsted in another country and not wanting Watechepel. Everyone knows that neither Alexanderplatz nor Wilhelmstrasse is the complete Berlin: it is just a district of a cut-off city.
    Frankfurt on the Main and Frankfurt on the Oder are two German cities located in two countries. Neither of these countries can be called the whole of Germany: they are only part of Germany.
    Can the latest invention of the fantasists on the other side of the Atlantic - the so-called "European Defense Community" - be disguised as Europe? Only five and a half countries participate in the "European Defense Community": France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and half of Germany. But the supporters of this alliance shamelessly make people believe that they represent Europe.
    We should say that this is a strange Europe, a Europe without London and Moscow, without Berlin and Warsaw, without Prague and Stockholm, a Europe that is headless, legless, incomplete, and can be carried around at will. This Europe may be easily packed in a carry-on bag for shipment overseas, but it does not resemble our ancient and glorious continent at all.
    But Europe is not an abstract concept, not an accidental term of ancient geographers. Despite the various natural conditions in Europe, despite the different historical destinies in Europe, and despite the vastly different political and social systems in Europe, Europe is indeed an indivisible whole: it has a common cultural origin; since ancient times, the various ethnic groups living in Europe have cherished all the happiness derived from the exchange of spiritual and material treasures, and they believe from painful experience that the destruction of this exchange will lead to poverty and rationing. At the same time, every thoughtful European is very concerned not only about the security of his own country, but also about the security of all European countries, because a fire in one house will threaten the entire village, and our Europe is not a desert, not a prairie, it is the most densely populated place in the world.
    How complex Europe is! No one denies that there are countries with capitalist economies and countries with socialist economies in Europe. Of course, the residents of Warsaw or Prague can understand the difficulties and victories of Soviet society more easily than the residents of Paris or London. Naturally, there is also a kind of unity between the exchanges of Brussels, Lisbon, and Stockholm. Sociologists or politicians have the right to talk about the existence of these two types of countries in Europe. These two types of countries can compete peacefully with each other, they can ideologically oppose each other, but they have a common interest: both types of countries are concerned about defending peace.
    The train speeds from the Ural Mountains, through dense forests, through iron smelting furnaces and schools, across Europe's largest river - the Volga River, to Moscow with its ancient Kremlin and its centuries of youth, and then through Warsaw, which has been resurrected from the ashes, through the divided Berlin, across the Rhine River and its castles, to Paris, which looks like a stone jungle of centuries, and then to the last cape of Europe, where Breton fishermen dry their pale blue fishing nets in the biting sea breeze. Airplanes fly from the small gingerbread-like Derangsu beyond the Arctic Circle, over the chimneys of the Ruhr, over the snow-covered Alps, over Italy's olive trees and marble, and over the melancholy rocks of Calabria. The bagpipes of Scotland are different from the mandolins of Naples, Swedish etiquette is cumbersome, the life of Bupuwens is simple, Belgium is densely populated, and Aragonese farmers have to ride donkeys from morning to night through sparsely populated mountainous areas. In Europe, there are countries with huge feudal territories, there are extremely small plots of land, and there are vast green fields of collective farms; there are kings and presidents of republics, there are judges with wigs and Communist Young Pioneers, Jesus churches and rural ten-year schools, millionaires and working people's Soviets - a winding strip often marks out two centuries.
    However, differences in customs, differences in political and social systems have never prevented the various ethnic groups in Europe from feeling the commonality of their destinies. Ancient Greece enriched it with its legacy, great art, and the seeds of humanism. Christianity is a common impulse and disease in Europe. The Renaissance discovered the amazing and valuable culture of the ancient world, it made human treasures triumph over medieval superstitions, and it made Italy and Russia, France and Bulgaria developed. Everyone familiar with the creation of the great Russian painter Andrei Rublev will understand how similar his creation is to the creation of Guido. In fact, the cultural history of Europe does not need to be studied according to McCarthy's speeches…
    Italian architects, French scholars, and Russian composers have enriched the entire Europe. No educated European does not know the names of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Moliere, Goethe, and Tolstoy. In all European universities - whether at Oxford University and Paris University, whether at Prague's oldest Charles University and Moscow University, students know the contributions of Pasteur, Curie, Einstein, and Pavlov to science. Can you imagine that the novels of modern French or British writers do not reflect the spiritual discoveries of the great Russian novelists? Can you imagine that modern painters from any European country can not learn a lot from French masters? Of course, Nicholas I's inspectors were not idle, but Belinsky, Herzen, and Shchedrin still read the works of progressive French writers. In recent years, French inspectors have repeatedly banned Soviet books and magazines from going to France; but this cannot prevent the French from yearning to hear the voices of Russian scientists and writers. Yes, Europe has commonality. The French Revolution shook the Spanish countryside and St. Petersburg Square. The fantasies of utopian socialists awakened the workers of Lyon and the petty citizens of Russia. Karl Marx's writings became the foundation of a new century for millions of Europeans. The October Revolution changed the consciousness of all European residents - some saw the embodiment of their hopes, and some also understood that they would inevitably perish.
    Even in ancient times, when it took months to go from one European country to another, the people of Europe tried their best to get closer to each other, not to separate; their representatives were travelers, ambassadors, and merchants, mainly merchants: long before international expositions and international conferences, Europe had a large international market. French republicans liked to eat bread made from wheat bought from Tsarist Russia, and Russian royalists did not dislike French silk fabrics. One country sent wood, another country sent coal, and a third country sent minerals. Differences in political ideas cannot affect exports and imports.
    When the storm struck, when the plunder of a small group of people threatened Europe, the countries united to try to eliminate the invaders' offenses. This happened during the Napoleonic era, when European countries with various political systems rose up together to oppose this tyrant, including Russian reservists from serf origins and British generals from aristocratic origins, Spanish peasants and Prussian university students, and patriots from all European countries. This also happened not long ago in the Hitler era, when the Soviet army found allies among the people of Britain, Greece, Poland, Norway, and France.
    The conspiracy to turn half of Europe against the other half has always been inseparable from insulting the national culture of the European people and trampling on the entire European culture. Napoleon tried in vain to convince people that he was building a united Europe and sent his brothers to European countries to be kings, but his empire collapsed like a house made of cards. Hitler's "New Europe" also fell into the same fate, neither Laval, nor Mussolini, nor Quisling could save the "New Europe", and it is too naive to expect the "European Defense Community" that is currently being tried to be imposed on six European countries by people from another continent to succeed. The people of European countries clearly remember some terrible events not long ago.
    The people of European countries have memories, and they indignantly oppose the shameless and absurd conspiracy to create such a "Europe," because such a Europe would exclude a European country, which has contributed more than all other countries in liberating the European people from the heinous fascist shackles with sacrifices, bloodshed and heroic actions.
    Apparently the defenders of the "European Defense Community" completely do not understand what is called ridiculous. There is a "European Security Committee" in the Bonn Congress, which is now engaged in restoring the Wehrmacht. The residents of Paris and Warsaw, the residents of Rome and Kiev, the residents of Copenhagen and Prague still hear the sound of soldiers' leather boots and the rows of artillery fire of executioners, and at the same time, those who issue weapons to yesterday's SS people calmly declare that they are concerned about "European security". If one did not think of so much blood and tears, one would laugh at this statement.
    No, the people of Europe will not regard the restoration of the Wehrmacht, the establishment of new military alliances, and the division of Europe in half as their savior. They hope that Europe will be like a garden and not a military camp, they hope that the roads of Europe will not be covered with barbed wire, they hope that their destiny should be decided by themselves at the round table, not in the secret offices of the New World.
    All Europeans warmly welcome the signs of economic cooperation between Western and Eastern European countries. Not long ago, American politicians and businessmen thought they could prevent such cooperation. But the work of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe shows that this plan is unfounded. Many agreements, whether already signed or intended to be signed, prove that a healthy body will overcome the disease. The people of European countries hope to do business with each other, and even this matter has a bad effect on the nervous systems of some members of parliament. The fact that Poland is a people's democratic country will not prevent the French from buying Silesian coal, and the British will not be disturbed because the Soviet manganese is mined by people who can be called neither Conservatives nor Her Majesty's opponents.
    Europeans also welcome the revitalization of cultural ties. It is very good that Muscovites can quickly see Moliere's plays, Parisians can appreciate Soviet ballet, Italian movies are staged in Leningrad, Prague, and Budapest, and West German music lovers can see the performances of Soviet musicians. It should be hoped that this is only a beginning: we in Moscow can also see exhibitions of French painters, Shakespeare's plays, Milan's operas, and exhibitions of Swedish and Dutch architects. The residents of Western Europe will be very interested in learning about the Soviet Union's medical achievements, Soviet children's books, the architecture of New Warsaw, and the achievements of the Czechoslovak printing industry.
    However, for the fate of Europe, the most important thing is to defend peace, and first of all, the issue of the security of their countries that excites Europeans. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet delegation's proposal on European security at the Berlin Conference has aroused such a warm response in all European countries and among people of different political beliefs.
    Common suffering brings people closer together, and Europe has suffered two terrible wars in a short period of time. Those who have only seen wars on the screen will not understand the thoughts and feelings of Europe… The commonality of Europe is most clearly expressed in the intention to defend peace, protect the sovereignty of every country - whether large or small - and establish an organization that can avoid further bloodshed. Many articles have been written about the Soviet proposals, and more has been talked about and thought about than written. No one can bury this proposal. The idea of ​​European collective security has taken root deeply in the minds of every rational person. Of course, the road from the first draft to the completed building is not smooth, but we are convinced that European countries will eventually unite to defend peace and ensure the security of every country and every family.
    The organization of European collective security is not to oppose other continents of the world. On the contrary, any peace-loving American, Chinese, Brazilian, or Indian is concerned that peace in Europe can be guaranteed, because wars on the European continent have more than once swept the world. Perhaps, many residents of New York do not know what the meaning of the words "European collective security" is - not all newspapers take on the responsibility of educating readers, and many newspapers prefer to keep readers ignorant, but the truth will sooner or later reach the distant Nevada farm, and then all Americans will see that a Europe united in defending the security of European countries is a guarantee of peace for all mankind.
    Those who would rather see the economic bankruptcy of other continents than peace have not woken up and have not rested. On the contrary, they are now more stubbornly talking about war, about various bombers and various weapons. They do not want to understand that there have been many changes in the world in recent years, and they do not want to understand that their poisonous spells cannot change the course of history. The pointer of the barometer is rising, which is much more important than the theatrical thunder from across the ocean. Not long ago, millions of Europeans thought that war was destined and inevitable, but now they see all the advantages of negotiations, even though these negotiations are difficult, complex, and long-term. When thinking about diplomatic conferences or notes, the turning point is still unclear, but in the heart of every ordinary European, the turning point is very clear: for Europeans, the shadow of war is moving away, and ordinary Europeans are now seriously considering how to get rid of this shadow forever.
    The fate of Europe depends on the reason and goodwill of the European nations. Every nation walks its own path, and every nation has its own experience, its own traditions, and its own customs. It is absolutely impossible to push the thirty-two countries of Europe onto one track. The superiority of various social systems cannot be proved by the destructive power of bombs, which can equally easily destroy socialist factories or capitalist factories, but the superiority of various social systems is proved by creative labor, culture, and the improvement of the material living standards, as well as the development of science and art. The Soviet people regard themselves as the vanguard of the future and are proud of this; the idea of ​​imposing their own way of life on other nations is not only contrary to them, but also extremely disgusting to them. They hope that Europe has peace, first of all because people engaged in construction abhor war. They hope for peace for their cities and villages, their children, and their future. They hope for peace in Europe because they cherish and love the culture of the European people.
    Now it is time for the unlearned or mediocre people in the West to stop this absurd argument: saying that the Soviet people do not understand the countries of Asia and Europe. Since ancient times, Russians have loved the freedom-loving French people, British culture, and inspiring Italy. Is it necessary to recall Herzen's wonderful remarks about the sacred stones of Europe? Is it necessary to quote Belinsky and Shchedrin, Gogol and Turgenev, Chekhov and Gorky, Blok and Mayakovsky? They spoke the words of our people. We are happy that we have learned many things from our Western neighbors, and we are happy that we have also taught them many things. In this regard, we have not used ledgers, have not peddled ideas, have not asked for high prices, and have not pretended to be poor. We cherish the future of Europe, because we have Moscow and Leningrad, Moscow and Leningrad are precious to all good people in Europe, just as we cherish Paris, Rome, and London. We are willing to defend the great heritage and future of Europe together with all European countries. We live in the same continent of the world with the French, British, Danish, Hungarian, German, and Italian people, we have a common home with them - Europe, and we will defend the peace of this home with the greatest enthusiasm of a human-loving heart.

专栏：

    欧洲的命运
    苏联伊里亚·爱伦堡
   “拉露斯小百科辞典”在巴黎每年都要再版。使用这部辞典的有小学生，有科学院士，有不相信自己的书法的农民，有字谜的爱好者和引用古典作品中的字句来准备演说的议员们。可以说，这是法国最流行的一本书，它所服务的人已不只一代了。当然，这本参考书里的许多东西都改变了：新的社会制度产生了，科学家们的发明使世界丰富起来，有的字在产生，有的字在衰亡。但是，也有一些真理是在很久以前的“拉露斯辞典”第一版和最近的一版里，都可以找到的：牛是反刍动物，珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰，牛顿发明了万有引力定律。无论在“拉露斯辞典”的第一版或最近一版里，都有下面的一条：
   “欧洲拥有广阔的土地，北以北冰洋为界，西有大西洋，南有地中海和与它相连的河流，以及高加索山脊，东以乌拉尔山，乌拉尔河和里海为界。南高加索和冰岛通常也包括在欧洲之内。”
    我认为，法国的政客一般都有这种初级地理知识，而且“拉露斯辞典”也在为他们效劳。如果他们之间有人怀疑欧洲从何处起到何处止的话，那就应当归咎于美国的幻想，而不应当归咎于法国的中学校了。
    实际上，我们现在可以看到，有些政客非常轻率地要改变世界各洲的界线。常常可以读到这样的消息：欧洲的边界是在奥得河甚至易北河上。各种各样的欧洲出现了：一会儿是“煤钢”欧洲，一会儿是“斯特拉斯堡”欧洲，一会儿又是“防务集团”欧洲；参加这些联盟的有时是欧洲国家的四分之一，有时是五分之一。这并不妨碍那些把“欧洲”任意割裂成各式各样的发明家屡次硬说他们的联合就代表着欧洲，代表着以文明著名的世界那一大洲——真正的欧洲。
    在外长会议期间来到柏林的各国记者，对于这个城市的生活是非常惊奇的：他们的面前有两个柏林。法国人不由得想到，如果蒙麦德尔和蒙派那斯用一条界线分开的话，那么巴黎会成什么样呢。英国人很难想像伦敦看中了在别国的赫姆普斯德特，而不要瓦特契普尔。大家都清楚，无论是亚历山大普拉茨或维米尔斯道尔夫都不是完整的柏林：这只是被切开的城市的街区。
    美茵河的法兰克福和奥得河的法兰克福分布在两个国家的两个德国城市。绝不能把这两个国家的任何一个称为全德国：它们只是德国的一部分。
    能够把大西洋彼岸的幻想家们最近的发明——所谓“欧洲防务集团”——冒充欧洲吗？参加“欧洲防务集团”的只有五个半国家：法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和半个德国。但是这个联盟的拥护者们却大言不惭地使人相信好像他们就代表欧洲。
    我们应该说，这是一个奇怪的欧洲，这个欧洲没有伦敦和莫斯科，没有柏林和华沙，没有布拉格和斯德哥尔摩，这是一个缺头断腿、残缺不全、可以随便携带的欧洲，这个欧洲也许可以很轻便地装在一个运往海外的手提皮包里，但是一点也不像我们古老而光荣的大陆。
    但是欧洲不是抽象的概念，不是古代地理学家的偶然的术语。尽管欧洲有各种各样的自然条件，尽管欧洲有各不相同的历史命运，尽管欧洲有差别很大的政治和社会制度，但欧洲究竟是一个不可分割的整体：它有一个共同的文化发源地；自古以来，住在欧洲的各民族都珍爱由于精神上和物质上的宝贵的东西交流而得来的一切幸福，他们根据痛苦的经验相信，这种交流的破坏会引到贫困和灯火管制。同时每一个有思想的欧洲人，不仅对于自己国家的安全，而且对于所有欧洲国家的安全都是非常关心的，因为一家起火就会威胁全村，而我们的欧洲不是荒漠，不是大草原，它是世界上人口最稠密的地方。
    欧洲是多么复杂啊！任何人都不否认，在欧洲有资本主义经济的国家和社会主义经济的国家。当然，华沙或布拉格的居民比起巴黎人或伦敦人更容易理解苏维埃社会的困难和胜利。自然，在布鲁塞尔、里斯本、斯德哥尔摩的交易所之间也有一种团结。社会学家或政治家们有权谈论在欧洲存在这两类国家。这两类国家可以互相和平地竞赛，它们在思想上能够彼此对立，但是它们有一个共同的利益：这两类国家都关心保卫和平。
    火车从乌拉尔山飞驰，经过密林，经过镕铁炉和学校，通过欧洲最大的河流——伏尔加河，到达有着古老的克里姆林宫的和有着世纪的青春的莫斯科，继而，经过从灰烬中复活起来的华沙，经过四分五裂的柏林，通过莱茵河和它的城堡，到达像是一个数世纪之久的石头丛林的巴黎，再走，就到了欧洲最后的海角，在这里，布列顿的渔夫迎着凛冽的海风晾干他们淡青色的鱼网。飞机从北极圈以外的小姜饼似的德琅索飞过鲁尔烟囱的上空，飞过积雪的阿尔卑斯山，飞过意大利的橄榄树和大理石，飞过卡拉布里的忧郁的山石的上空。苏格兰的风笛和那不勒斯的曼陀铃不同，瑞典的礼节繁琐，布普温斯的生活质朴，比利时人烟稠密，阿拉贡农民要从早到晚骑着驴走过人烟稀少的山区。在欧洲有巨大的封建领地的国家，有极小块的土地，也有集体农庄辽阔的绿色田地；有国王和共和国总统，有带着假发的法官和共产主义少年先锋队队员，耶稣教堂和农村里的十年制学校，百万富翁和劳动人民苏维埃——一条蜿蜒的地带时常划出了两个世纪。
    但是，风俗习惯的不同，政治和社会制度的不同，从来没有妨害欧洲各民族感到他们的命运的共同性。古代希腊以它的遗产，伟大的艺术和人道主义萌芽使它丰富起来。基督教是欧洲的共同的冲动和病症。文艺复兴发现了古代世界令人惊奇的宝贵文化，它使人类的珍宝战胜中世纪的迷信，它使意大利和俄国、法国和保加利亚发达起来。每一个熟悉俄国伟大画家安德烈·鲁勃廖夫的创作的人都会了解他的创作与归多的创作是多么近似。说实在话，欧洲的文化史是不需要按照麦卡锡的演说来研究的……
    意大利的建筑家，法国的学者，俄国的作曲家使全欧洲丰富起来。没有一个有知识的欧洲人不知道莎士比亚、塞万提斯、莫里哀、哥德和托尔斯泰的名字。在欧洲所有的大学里——无论在牛津大学和巴黎大学，无论在布拉格最老的卡尔洛夫大学和莫斯科大学，大学生们都知道巴士德、居里、爱因斯坦和巴甫洛夫对科学的贡献。能够设想现代的法国或英国作家的小说里没有反映出伟大的俄国小说家精神上的发现吗？能够设想任何一个欧洲国家的现代画家能不从法国大师那里学到很多东西吗？当然，尼古拉一世的检查官并不是闲着没事干的，可是别林斯基、赫尔岑、谢德林依然读过先进的法国作家的著作。最近几年来，法国的检查官屡次禁止苏联的书籍和杂志到法国去；但是，这是不能阻碍法国人渴望听到俄国科学家和作家的声音。是的，欧洲是有共同性的。法国的革命撼动了西班牙的农村和圣彼得堡的广场。乌托邦的社会主义者的幻想唤醒了里昂的工人和俄国的小市民。卡尔·马克思的著作成了千百万欧洲人的新世纪的基础。十月革命改变了欧洲全体居民的意识——有的人看到了自己希望的体现，有的人也懂得了自己必会遭到灭亡。
    甚至在古老的时代，从欧洲这一国家到另一国家去而需要走几个月的时候，欧洲的人民都是想尽办法彼此接近，而不是分隔；他们的代表者就是旅行家、大使和商人，主要是商人：在国际博览会和国际会议以前好久，欧洲就有了很大的国际市集。法国共和主义者喜欢吃从沙皇俄国买来的麦子做成的面包，俄国保皇分子也没有厌恶法国的丝织品。一个国家送来木材，另一个国家送来煤，第三个国家送来矿产。政治思想上的不同并不能影响到输出和输入。
    当暴风雨袭来的时候，当一小撮人的掠夺狂威胁到欧洲的时候，各个国家就曾团结起来，企图消灭掠夺者的侵犯。拿破仑时代就发生过这样的事，当时各种不同政治制度的欧洲国家起来共同反对这个暴君，参加的人有俄国农奴出身的后备军和英国贵族出身的将军，西班牙的农民和普鲁士的大学生，以及欧洲各国的爱国者。不久以前在希特勒的时代也有过这样的事，当时苏军在英国、希腊、波兰、挪威和法国人民之间都找到了同盟者。
    想使一半欧洲反对另外半个欧洲的阴谋，一向是与侮辱欧洲人民的民族文化和蹂躏整个的欧洲文化分不开的。拿破仑枉费心机地使人相信他建立起联合欧洲，把自己的兄弟派到欧洲各国去作国王，但是他的帝国就像用纸牌搭成的房子一样倒塌了。希特勒的“新欧洲”也陷入了同样的命运，无论是赖伐尔、无论是墨索里尼，或者是吉斯林都不能挽救“新欧洲”，假若指望目前正由另外一个大陆上的人们设法强加在欧洲六个国家身上的“欧洲防务集团”会成功，那真是太天真了。欧洲各国的人民都很清楚地记得不久以前的一些可怕事件。
    欧洲各国的人民有记忆力，他们愤慨地反对制造这样一种“欧洲”的无耻而荒谬的阴谋，因为这样的欧洲要排斥这样一个欧洲国家，这个国家在以牺牲、流血和英勇行动而使欧洲人民从万恶的法西斯桎梏下获得解放方面，比所有其他国家都更有贡献。
    显然“欧洲防务集团”的辩护者完全不懂得什么叫做可笑。在波恩国会里有一个“欧洲安全委员会”，这个委员会现在正从事恢复国防军。巴黎和华沙的居民，罗马和基辅的居民，哥本哈根和布拉格的居民的耳朵里还响着士兵们的皮靴声和刽子手们一排排的炮声，同时，那些把武器发给昨天的党卫军的人们，却心平气和地宣称他们关心“欧洲的安全”。如果不是想起那么多的血和泪，人们对这种说法是要付之一笑的。
    不是的，欧洲人民不会把恢复国防军、建立新的军事同盟，把欧洲分成两半看作是自己的救星。他们希望欧洲像一个花园而不要成为军营，他们希望欧洲的道路上不要布满铁丝网，他们希望他们的命运应当由他们自己在圆桌上决定，而不要在新大陆秘密办公室中来决定。
    所有的欧洲人都热烈地欢迎西欧和东欧各国之间实行经济合作的征兆。不久以前，美国的政客和商人还认为他们能够阻止这样的合作。但是联合国欧洲经济委员会的工作说明这种打算是毫无根据的。许多的协定，无论是已经签订的或是打算签订的，都证明健康的身体会战胜疾病。欧洲各国人民是希望互相作买卖的，甚至于这件事情对于某些国会议员的神经系统起着不好的影响。波兰是人民民主国家的这一事实是不会妨害法国人去买希列兹的煤的，英国人也不会因为苏联的锰是被那些既不能称为保守党人，也不能称为陛下反对者的人们所开采的而感到不安。
    欧洲人同样欢迎使文化联系活跃起来。莫斯科人能很快地看到莫里哀的戏剧，巴黎人欣赏一下苏联的巴蕾舞，意大利的电影在列宁格勒、布拉格、布达佩斯上演，西德的音乐爱好者能够看到苏联音乐家的表演，这是很好的。应该希望这仅是一个开端：我们在莫斯科也能看到法国画家的展览会、莎士比亚的戏剧、米兰的歌舞剧以及瑞典和荷兰建筑师的展览会。西欧的居民将会很有兴趣地去了解苏联的医学成就、苏联的儿童读物、新华沙的建筑、捷克斯洛伐克印刷业的成就。
    但是，对于欧洲的命运来说，最重要的是保卫和平，首先是使欧洲人激动的关于他们国家的安全问题。正因为如此，苏联代表团在柏林提出的欧洲安全问题的建议，在所有的欧洲国家里，在不同政治信仰的人之间引起了如此热烈的响应。
    共同的痛苦使人们接近起来，在一段很短的时间内欧洲已遭到了两次恐怖的战争。只在银幕上看过战争的人们是不会理解欧洲的思想和感情的……欧洲的共同性最清楚地表现在保卫和平，保护每一个国家——无论是大国和小国——的主权，以及建立可以避免再流血的这样一个组织的意图。关于苏联的建议，已有人写了许多文章，而谈的、想的比写的还要多。没有人能够把这个建议埋葬掉。欧洲集体安全的思想已经在每一个有理智的人的思想中深深地扎下了根。当然，从第一个草图到建成的建筑物的道路不是平坦的，但是我们深信欧洲国家终将团结起来保卫和平，保障每一个国家、每一个家庭的安全。
    欧洲集体安全的组织不是为了反对世界其他各洲。相反地，任何一个爱好和平的美国人、中国人、巴西人、印度人都关心欧洲的和平能获得保障，因为在欧洲大陆上发生的战争，不止一次席卷了全世界。也许，纽约的许多居民不知道“欧洲集体安全”这几个字的含义是什么，——并不是一切报纸都负起教育读者的责任，许多的报纸宁愿使读者愚昧无知，但是真理迟早会传到辽远的内华达的农庄去的，那时所有的美国人都会看到在保卫欧洲各国安全的事业上团结起来的欧洲，就是全人类的和平的保证。
    宁愿其他大陆的经济破产而不愿和平的人们还没有醒悟，也没有静息下来，相反，他们现在更加顽固地谈论着战争，谈论着各种轰炸机和各种武器。他们不想明白近年来世界上有了许多变化，他们不想明白他们的毒恶的咒语是不能够改变历史的进程的。气压表的指针升起来了，这比从海洋彼岸传来的舞台上的雷声重要得多。还是不久以前，千百万的欧洲人认为战争是命定的、不可避免的，而现在他们看见了谈判的全部优越性，尽管这些谈判是困难的、复杂的和长期的。当想到外交会议或照会时，转机还是不明朗的，但是在每一个普通的欧洲人的心里，转机却看得很清楚：对欧洲人来说，战争魔影是离远了，普通的欧洲人现在认真地考虑到如何永远摆脱这个魔影。
    欧洲的命运系于欧洲各民族的理智和善良的意志。每一个民族走着自己的道路，每一个民族都有自己的经验，自己的传统，自己的习俗。绝不能把欧洲的三十二个国家推到一个轨道上去。各种社会制度的优越性是不能用炸弹的破坏力来证明的，炸弹能同样轻易地消灭社会主义的工厂或资本主义的工厂，而证明各种社会制度的优越性的，却是创造性的劳动、文化和物质生活水平的提高，以及科学和艺术的发展。苏联人民把自己看作是未来的先锋队，并以此而感到自豪；苏联人民喜欢鼓舞别人，而把自己的生活方式强加在别的民族身上的思想，不仅是与他们背道而驰的，而且是他们异常厌恶的。他们希望欧洲有和平，首先是因为从事建设的人民厌恶战争。他们为了他们的城市和村庄、他们的儿童、他们的将来而希望着和平。他们希望欧洲和平，因为他们珍视、喜爱欧洲人民的文化。
    现在应该是西方不学无术的人或庸人们停止这种荒谬论调的时候了：说苏联人民不了解亚欧各国。自古以来俄国人都是热爱那爱好自由的法国人民、英国的文化、使人鼓舞的意大利。是不是需要回忆一下赫尔岑关于欧洲神圣的石头的妙语呢？是不是需要去引证别林斯基和谢德林、果戈理和屠格涅夫、契诃夫和高尔基、布洛克和马雅可夫斯基的话呢？他们说出了我们人民的话。我们幸福的是我们从西方邻人那里学会了许多东西，我们幸福的是我们也教给了他们许多东西，在这方面我们没有使用出纳簿，没有贩卖思想，没有索过高价，也没有假装穷困。我们珍视欧洲的未来，因为我们有莫斯科和列宁格勒，莫斯科和列宁格勒对于欧洲的一切好人都是珍贵的，就像我们珍贵巴黎、罗马、伦敦一样。我们愿意与欧洲所有国家一道来保卫欧洲的伟大遗产与将来。我们与法国人、英国人、丹麦人、匈牙利人、德国人以及意大利人住在世界的同一个大洲上，我们与他们有一个共同的家——欧洲，我们将以一颗热爱人类的心的最大热情来保卫这个家的和平。
