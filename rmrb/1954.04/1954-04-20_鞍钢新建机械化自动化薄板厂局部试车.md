Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's newly built, China's first mechanized and automated sheet mill – Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Sheet Mill, has begun a partial trial run. All of the plant's dozens of electromagnetic stations were officially energized starting April 8th. Over a hundred distribution panels, after undergoing power reception operations, have proven to be of good quality. This has created conditions for trial runs of individual components of many machines throughout the plant. Currently, trial runs have begun on individual components of the plant's most important machines, as well as the heating furnace bottom, roughing mill, finishing mill, and cutting machines of the finishing system. In a few more days, the mechanical repair shop, equipped with various machine tools such as steam hammers, forging furnaces, and gantry planers, as well as the inspection room equipped with various precision instruments, will be handed over to the production units to begin preparations for hot test rolling and production.

From partial trial runs to completion is an arduous and complex working process. The plant's machines must go from the operation of a single component to the operation of the entire machine, from the operation of one machine to the simultaneous joint operation of all sections and workshops throughout the plant, before hot test rolling can be carried out. Soviet experts guiding the trial runs carefully inspected each important machine before its trial run. The managers and all employees of the various engineering companies responsible for the construction of the sheet mill, although they encounter many complicated problems every day, are overcoming difficulties with a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, working intensely to strive for the early commissioning of this mechanized and automated sheet mill.

    鞍钢新建机械化自动化薄板厂局部试车
    据新华社鞍山电：鞍山钢铁公司新建我国第一座机械化自动化的薄板厂——鞍钢第二薄板厂，已开始局部试车。全厂几十个电磁站从四月八日起就正式通电。一百多面配电盘经过受电操作，证明质量良好。这就为全厂许多机器进行部分部件的试车创造了条件。现在，开始试车的有全厂最主要机器的个别部件以及加热炉底，荒轧、精轧和精整系统的剪断机等。再过几天，设有汽锤、锻造炉和龙门刨等各种机床的机械修理车间，还有设有多种精密仪器的检验室，就可以移交给生产单位，开始为热试轧和开工生产进行准备。
    从局部试车到完工，是一个艰巨而复杂的工作过程，全厂的机器要从某一个部件的运转到整个机器的运转，从一部机器的运转直到全厂各工段各车间同时联合运转，然后才能进行热试轧。指导试车的苏联专家在每个重要的机器试车前，都认真地进行了检查。担负薄板厂建厂工作的各工程公司的经理和全体职工们虽然每天都要碰到许多繁杂的问题，但是他们都以互助协作的精神克服困难，为争取这座机械化自动化薄板厂早日投入生产而紧张劳动。
