We must be good at concentrating and giving play to everyone's wisdom, and strengthening collective and specific leadership over scientific research work. Vice President Li Siguang said: The establishment of the Secretariat and the commencement of the preparatory work for the departments is a concrete gain from our learning of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. We hope that through these steps, we can truly organize China's scientific research work. Although the responsibility for this work is very heavy, we have the confidence to do this work well. Vice President Zhang Jiafu emphasized that the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the highest academic research institution in the country, and it should become the center of scientific research work in the country, absorb accomplished scientific experts from all fields to participate in academic leadership work, and promote the scientific cause of New China.

    秘书处是院长会议加强学术领导的有力助手。参加秘书处工作的有钱三强、贝时璋、叶渚沛、钱伟长、柳大纲、张文佑、刘大年、叶笃正等著名科学家。
    学部是中国科学院领导所属各研究所进行学术研究的机构。目前先着手筹备设立四个学部。四个部和各部负责人是：物理数学化学部，主任吴有训、副主任庄长恭、华罗庚；生物学地学部，主任竺可桢、副主任许杰、陈凤桐；技术科学部，主任严济慈、副主任茅以升、武衡；社会科学部，主任郭沫若、副主任张稼夫。
