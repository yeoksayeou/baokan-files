After the 12th enlarged meeting of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the provincial committees of the CPC in the Southwest region generally convened meetings to convey the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

From March 16th to April 14th, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC convened its Second Party Representative Meeting to convey and discuss the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session. Based on the Party's general line during the transition period and the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, the meeting reviewed the province's work in 1953 and deployed the main work tasks for 1954. More than 500 people attended and participated in the meeting, including members of the Provincial Committee, responsible cadres of various departments and commissions of the Provincial Committee, secretaries and members of local prefectural and municipal committees, secretaries of county committees, and representatives from factories, mines, troops, and government organs. More than 700 party cadres in provincial and municipal organs and people's organizations, equivalent to members of county committees and above, also attended the meeting as observers.

After listening to Comrade Xie Fuzhi's report on conveying the resolutions of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, the meeting conducted serious and conscientious study and discussion. The delegates unanimously supported the report made by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and the resolution on strengthening Party unity adopted by the Fourth Plenary Session. Based on the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, the meeting seriously reviewed the state of unity within the Party organization in Yunnan Province. The meeting emphasized that Yunnan Province is located on the national defense frontier, faces the direct threat of imperialism, and is a multi-ethnic region, and that the Party had previously made serious mistakes of localism in the past. Therefore, it must be even more vigilant. The meeting unfolded criticism and self-criticism in an atmosphere of close unity. Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted corresponding resolutions on implementing the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session.

In addition, the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provincial committees, besides already conveying and discussing the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session at the provincial committee standing committee or enlarged standing committee meetings, are convening enlarged provincial committee meetings to further convey and discuss the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session.

    【本报重庆十七日电】在中共中央西南局第十二次扩大会议后，中共西南区各省省委普遍召开会议，传达七届四中全会的决议。
    中共云南省委在三月十六日到四月十四日召开了第二次党代表会议，传达和讨论了七届四中全会的文件，并根据党在过渡时期的总路线和四中全会决议，检查了一九五三年全省的各项工作，布置了一九五四年全省的主要工作任务。出席和列席会议的，有省委委员，省委各部委的负责干部，各地地委、市委书记和委员，各县县委书记，以及工厂、矿山、部队、机关的代表，共五百多人。省市机关和人民团体中相当于县委委员以上的党员干部七百多人也参加会议旁听。
    会议听了谢富治同志关于七届四中全会决议的传达报告后，进行了严肃认真的学习和讨论。到会代表一致拥护中共中央政治局向七届四中全会的报告和四中全会所通过的关于增强党的团结的决议。会议根据四中全会的决议，严肃地检查了云南省党的组织的团结情况。会议强调指出：云南省地处国防边疆，面临着帝国主义的直接威胁，是多民族地区，加以党内过去曾经有过严重的地方主义的错误，因此，必须更加引起严重警惕。会议在亲密团结的空气中展开了批评和自我批评。最后，会议一致通过了关于贯彻四中全会决议的相应的决议。
    此外，四川、贵州、西康等省委除已在省委常委会或常委扩大会议上传达和讨论四中全会决议外，正在召开省委扩大会议，进一步传达和讨论四中全会的决议。
