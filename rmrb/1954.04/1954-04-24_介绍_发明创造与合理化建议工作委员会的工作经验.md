Introducing "Work Experience of the Invention and Rationalization Proposal Work Committee"
    Shi Jinding
    Written by Soviet author Terekhov, translated by Zou Ning, published by Workers' Publishing House

    Carrying out invention and rationalization proposal movements is one of the main methods to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet trade union organizations have carried out tremendous work in this area and achieved remarkable results and experience. This book, written by Terekhov, uses many vivid practical examples to illustrate the tasks, roles, and experiences of the Invention and Rationalization Proposal Work Committee in building the Soviet socialist state.

    To carry out invention and rationalization proposal movements well, the organizational structure must first be sound. In the first part of this book, the author uses specific examples to illustrate that, in the Soviet Union, according to the organizational regulations, invention and rationalization proposal work committees of the masses of workers can be organized under the factory committee and the workshop committee with more than 500 employees. The work committee is elected by the production representative meeting or the general meeting of all employees by a show of hands. The number of members varies from three to fifteen depending on the number of employees. Many advanced factories and enterprises have made full preparations before selecting this work committee. The main tasks of this work committee are: to help rationalization proposers develop their creative enthusiasm, to expand the scope of work of rationalization proposers, to organize the collection and review of proposals and inventions, and to ensure the rapid implementation of proposals. The members of the work committee carry out their work according to the work plan approved by the higher authorities. At the same time, the work committee must establish a group composed of members of the work committee and active rationalization proposers. In the course of work, if it is found that a workshop has not carried out rationalization proposal work well, has not adopted proposals, has delayed the review and implementation of proposals, or has not given rationalization proposers the creative rights and bonuses they deserve, the work committee will send a group to investigate, find out the causes of these shortcomings, and formulate ways to eliminate these shortcomings. For those staff members who have committed bureaucratic errors, depending on the severity of the circumstances, it is recommended that administrative sanctions be imposed, or that they be sent to the court for criminal punishment. The work committee must also organize tutoring for rationalization proposers and inventors in various workshops in terms of technical aspects and drafting. At the same time, the work committee also selects the active workers in factories and mines as organizers of rationalization proposal work. Their tasks are: to organize competitions to strive for higher rationalization proposal work targets, to help rationalization proposers formulate topic selection plans for each month and ten-day period, and to collect and improve workers' proposals. In the Gorky City Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the organizers of rationalization proposal work played a great role. Due to the increase in the number of rationalization proposals, the plant saved more than 15 million rubles for the country in the first quarter of 1951 alone.

    Combining the creative activities of rationalization proposers and inventors with the implementation of national plans is of great significance in production competitions, and the author emphasizes this issue in the second part of the book. In the Soviet automotive and tractor manufacturing industries, all rationalization proposers and inventors actively participated in socialist competitions. In the Moscow "Stalin" Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the rationalization proposers of the generator manufacturing workshop participated in the socialist competition to win the title of "Excellent Workshop for Rationalization Proposal Work". They stipulated in their competition conditions: in 1950, an average of at least 35 proposals should be submitted for every 100 employees, ensuring that at least 75% of the adopted proposals are implemented, and relying on the implementation of these proposals, an average of 5,200 rubles should be saved per employee. As a result, they overfulfilled the task: an average of 42 proposals were submitted for every 100 employees, 87% of the adopted proposals were implemented, and an average of 8,827 rubles was saved per employee throughout the year. The personal savings registration system is an effective way for rationalization proposers to engage in socialist competition. For example, in the Moscow Carburetor Manufacturing Plant, personal savings registration was widely promoted. Karpov, a designer at the plant, guaranteed to save 150,000 rubles in 1950 by implementing the personal savings registration system, and as a result, saved 175,000 rubles for the factory.

    In the third part of the book, the author introduces the advanced experience of Soviet factories and enterprises in carrying out prize-winning competitions and public inspection work. Carrying out prize-winning competitions is an important method to strive for outstanding rationalization proposals and inventions. The factory's Invention and Rationalization Proposal Work Committee actively participated in the organization and development of this prize-winning competition. Many engineers, designers, and technicians were selected into the prize-winning competition work committee. The chairman of the work committee is usually the chief engineer. Correctly formulating the terms of the prize-winning competition can help rationalization proposers and inventors to exert their creative enthusiasm in solving urgent problems in production. Therefore, the organizational regulations of the prize-winning competition must determine the topic of the competition, stipulate the procedures for submitting and reviewing proposals, the rights and obligations of creators, the deadline for submitting proposals and the procedures for implementation, as well as the amount of the bonus, etc. When reviewing proposals, the prize-winning competition work committee should pay attention to whether it can improve the quality of the product, whether it has economic benefits, and what valuable and unique aspects it has. After determining the value of each proposal, the good proposals are selected for implementation and awarding. Then, the factory director issues a special order approving the decision of the prize-winning competition work committee, which is attached with a specific plan for implementing the proposal, specifying the implementation deadline and the person in charge. For example, the Kharkov Bicycle Manufacturing Plant carried out a prize-winning competition in 1950 and implemented a large number of rationalization proposals, thus saving a total of 2.6 million rubles. In addition, the system of public inspection is also implemented in Soviet factories and enterprises. A public inspection work committee is established throughout the factory, composed of the chairman or vice-chairman of the factory committee, the chief engineer, the chairman of the Invention and Rationalization Proposal Work Committee, representatives of the Labor and Wage Section, the chief designer, the chief technician, the chief mechanic, representatives of the Planning and Economic Section, rationalization proposers, and inventors, etc., and approved by the factory committee and the factory director. Work committees are also established in various workshops, and several inspection teams are formed by the public inspection work committee of the whole factory to select active rationalization proposers. The tasks of the public inspection work committee and the inspection teams are: to inspect the implementation of proposals and the improvement of product quality and the saving of wealth after the implementation of proposals, to assist the Invention and Rationalization Proposal Work Committee, to inspect and expose various bureaucratic phenomena that neglect or backlog rationalization proposals, and to strongly support the accusations of rationalization proposers against bureaucrats. Experience has proved that public inspection can not only help inventions and rationalization proposals to be quickly implemented in production, but also improve the invention and rationalization proposal work of the masses.

    At present, most of our country's factories and mines have organized rationalization proposal committees. However, they not only lack relatively mature experience in carrying out this work, but also have many shortcomings. For example, some of our factories and enterprises have established rationalization proposal work committees in name, but have not actually played their role; some leading cadres of factories and mines do not believe in the great creativity of the masses of workers, and adopt an attitude of backlog, delay, or "ignoring" the rationalization proposals of the masses of workers; and many cadres of factories and mines, although they also attach importance to rationalization proposal work, do not give specific help and correct leadership, resulting in the phenomenon of "thousands of tricks, but the task is not completed." Therefore, this book is of certain significance for us to further carry out the rationalization proposal movement in factories and mines in order to complete and overfulfill the state's production plans.

    介绍“发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会的工作经验”
    石金鼎
    苏联　捷列恒著　邹宁译　工人出版社出版
    开展发明创造与合理化建议运动，是完成增产节约任务的主要方法之一。苏联的工会组织在苏联共产党的领导之下，在这一方面曾进行了巨大的工作，并获得了显著的成绩和经验。捷列恒所写的这本书，就是用许多生动的实际例子，来说明发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会在建设苏联社会主义国家中的任务、作用和经验的。
    要想很好地开展发明创造与合理化建议运动，首先必须把组织机构健全起来。作者在本书第一篇中，通过具体事例来说明：在苏联，根据组织条例的规定，在工厂委员会以及拥有职工五百人以上的车间委员会之下，可以组织工人群众的发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会。该工作委员会是由生产代表会议或全体职工大会以举手表决方式选出的，委员名额视职工人数多寡定为三至十五人不等。许多先进的工厂企业，在选定这个工作委员会以前，都进行了充分的准备工作。这个工作委员会的主要任务是：帮助合理化建议者发挥创造积极性，扩大合理化建议者的工作范围，组织建议和发明创造的搜集及审查工作，保证迅速地实行建议。工作委员会的委员们都是按照上级批准的工作计划进行工作的。同时，工作委员会必须建立由工作委员会委员和积极的合理化建议者组成的小组。在工作过程中，如果发现哪个车间没有很好地开展合理化建议工作、没有采用建议、拖延对建议的审查和实行、没有给合理化建议者以应有的创造权和奖金等，工作委员会就指派一个小组下去调查，找出造成这些缺点的原因，并订出消灭这些缺点的办法。对于那些犯有官僚主义错误的工作人员，根据情节轻重，建议行政上给予一定处分，或者送交法院要求给予刑事处分。工作委员会还必须在建议的技术方面以及制图方面，为各车间的合理化建议者及发明家组织辅导工作。同时，该工作委员会并把厂矿中的工人积极分子选拔为合理化建议工作的组织者。他们的任务是：组织争取达到更高的合理化建议工作指标的竞赛，帮助合理化建议者拟定每月每旬的选题计划，并搜集工人的建议加以提高和构成等。在高尔基城汽车制造厂中，合理化建议工作组织者起了极大的作用。由于合理化建议数量的增加，该厂仅在一九五一年第一季度，就给国家节约了一千五百多万卢布。
    把合理化建议者和发明家的创造性活动与执行国家计划结合起来，在生产竞赛中是具有重大的意义的，作者在本书第二篇中着重地说明了这个问题。在苏联的汽车及拖拉机制造业中，全体合理化建议者和发明家都积极地参加了社会主义竞赛。在莫斯科“斯大林”汽车制造厂中，发电子制造间的合理化建议者，参加了争取获得“合理化建议工作的优秀车间”称号的社会主义竞赛。他们在自己的竞赛条件中规定：在一九五○年，平均每一百个工作人员至少提出三十五项建议，保证已被采纳的建议最少实行百分之七十五，依靠实行这些建议，平均每一个工作人员节约五千二百卢布。结果，他们超额完成了任务：平均每一百个工作人员提出了四十二项建议，已被采纳的建议实行了百分之八十七，平均每个工作人员全年节约了八千八百二十七卢布。个人节约登记制，是合理化建议者的社会主义竞赛的有效方式。例如，在莫斯科化合器制造厂中，广泛地推行了个人节约登记。该厂设计师卡尔波夫，保证用实行个人节约登记制的办法，在一九五○年节约十五万卢布，结果，给工厂节约了十七万五千卢布。
    在本书第三篇中，作者介绍了苏联的工厂企业开展有奖竞赛和公共检查工作的先进经验。开展有奖竞赛是争取提出卓越的合理化建议和发明创造的一种重要方法。工厂的发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会，积极地参加了这种有奖竞赛的组织工作和开展工作。许多工程师、设计师和技师，被选入有奖竞赛工作委员会。工作委员会主席通常由总工程师担任。正确地拟定有奖竞赛的条款，可帮助合理化建议者和发明家把自己的创造积极性发挥在解决生产中迫切的问题上。因此，在有奖竞赛的组织条例中，必须确定竞赛的课题，规定建议的提出和审查的程序、创造人的权利和义务、建议提出的期限和实行的程序，以及奖金的数额等。有奖竞赛工作委员会在审查建议时，应该注意它是否可改进产品的质量，是否具有经济效果，以及有哪些珍贵独特之处。确定各项建议的价值以后，就把好的建议选出，以便实行和发奖。然后，工厂厂长发布关于批准有奖竞赛工作委员会决定的专门命令，其中附有实行建议的具体计划，指定实行的期限和负责人。例如，哈尔科夫自行车制造厂在一九五○年，开展了有奖竞赛，实行了大量的合理化建议，因而共计节约了二百六十万卢布。此外，在苏联的工厂企业中，还实行了公共检查的制度。全厂成立一个公共检查工作委员会，由工厂委员会主席或副主席、总工程师、发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会主席、劳动工资科代表、总设计师、总技师、总机械师的代表、计划经济科代表、合理化建议者和发明家等组成，并由工厂委员会和厂长批准。在各个车间，也成立了工作委员会，并由全厂的公共检查工作委员会挑选积极的合理化建议者组成几个检查组。公共检查工作委员会和检查组的任务是：检查建议的实行情况和建议实行后提高产品质量与节约财富的情况，在协助发明创造与合理化建议工作委员会，检查并揭发各种忽视或积压合理化建议的官僚主义现象，大力支持合理化建议者对官僚主义者的控诉。经验证明，公共检查不仅可以帮助发明创造与合理化建议迅速在生产中实行，而且可以提高群众的发明创造与合理化建议工作。
    目前，我国大多数厂矿都已组织了合理化建议委员会。但是他们在开展这个工作方面，不仅缺乏比较成熟的经验，并且还存在着许多缺点。例如，我们有些工厂企业，虽在名义上建立了合理化建议工作委员会，但在实际上并未发挥它的作用；有些厂矿企业的领导干部，不相信工人群众的伟大创造力，对工人群众的合理化建议，采取积压、拖延或“置之不理”的态度；还有许多厂矿企业的干部，虽也重视合理化建议工作，但并没有给予具体的帮助和正确的领导，结果形成“窍门千千万，任务完不成”的现象。因此，这本书对于我们进一步开展厂矿企业中的合理化建议运动，以完成和超额完成国家的生产计划，是有一定的意义的。
