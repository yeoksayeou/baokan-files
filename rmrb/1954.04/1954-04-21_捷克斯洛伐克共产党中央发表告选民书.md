Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 20th: TASS reports that on April 18th, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party issued a letter to voters concerning the upcoming elections for the People's Committees, to be held on May 16th.

The letter to voters points out: On May 16, 1954, the working people of Czechoslovakia will elect their representatives to the People's Committees. This election will be a major event in the political life of our people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and closely united around the National Front, the masses will participate in the election.

The letter to voters states: In 1944-1945, the People's Committees made great contributions in organizing the Czechoslovak working people to fight against the fascist occupiers, and also played a huge role in mobilizing the Czechoslovak people for socialist construction. People's Democratic Czechoslovakia has completed its first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), and great achievements have been made in all sectors of economic and cultural construction. During the era of the People's government, the material and cultural standards of the working people have also improved.

The letter to voters then points out the tasks of the Czechoslovak people in developing industry, agriculture, culture, and defending peace in the recent period.

The letter to voters concludes by calling on all voters to participate in the election on May 16th and to vote for the candidates of the National Front.

    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央发表告选民书
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会十八日就即将于五月十六日举行的人民委员会选举发表了告选民书。
    告选民书指出：一九五四年五月十六日，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民将要选举自己的人民委员会的代表。这次选举将是我国人民政治生活中的重大事件。人民群众将在共产党领导下，紧密地团结在民族阵线的周围，进行选举。
    告选民书说：在一九四四—一九四五年，人民委员会在组织捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民和法西斯占领者进行斗争中曾作出了巨大贡献，在动员捷克斯洛伐克人民群众进行社会主义建设中，也起了巨大作用。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克已完成了第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年），经济和文化建设各部门都获得了很大成就。在人民政权年代中，劳动人民的物质和文化水平也提高了。
    告选民书接着指出了最近时期捷克斯洛伐克人民在发展工业、农业、文化以及保卫和平方面的任务。
    告选民书最后号召全体选民在五月十六日参加选举，并投票选举民族阵线的候选人。
