In order to directly serve national economic construction through the use of film, the Science Education Film Studio of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has decided to create 18 science education film scripts, produce 15 science education films and four issues of "Science and Technology" newsreels, and translate 24 science education films from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries in 1954.

The film production policy of the Science Education Film Studio this year will still focus on popularization films, emphasizing the introduction of basic scientific knowledge to enable general audiences to understand the scientific foundations of industrial construction; solve some agricultural science and technology problems; and also increase the number of topics on aquatic products, meteorology, geography, and explanations of social phenomena.

In terms of industrial construction, the selected topics include five themes: "Rubber," "How to Make Steel," "Mineral Exploration," "Parallel Flow Line Method," and "Overcoming High Temperatures in Factories." Among them, "Rubber" and "How to Make Steel" belong to the category of explaining the basic scientific knowledge of industrial construction, which can explain the important role of rubber and steel in industrial construction to the general audience; at the same time, it also introduces to the audience some of the main operating procedures of rubber manufacturing and steel production, so that the audience can understand the basic scientific principles of rubber and steel production. In terms of capital construction, "Parallel Flow Line Method" is selected, using building construction as the background, and introduces the production procedures and the reasonable organization methods of various types of work, which can be used as teaching films for construction workers and technicians. In the heavy industry sector, workers often carry out production under high temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees. The theme of "Overcoming High Temperatures in Factories" takes the advanced measures and methods of various enterprises and mines in solving the problem of high temperatures as its content. "Mineral Exploration" will explain how the Daye Geological Exploration Team in China, after adopting the advanced experiences of Soviet physical prospecting and deep drilling, found mineral deposits in the local area.

Regarding agriculture, there are topics such as "Freshwater Fish Farming," "Close Planting of Wheat," "Animal-Drawn Farm Implements," and "Cotton Red Bollworm." China has a very long history and rich experience in freshwater fish farming. The theme of the film "Freshwater Fish Farming" is to promote these experiences in China's vast freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and marshes. In addition, in agricultural production, with the development of agricultural cooperativization, farmers' demands for improving agricultural production technology are increasing. In order to meet this demand, the two themes of "Close Planting of Wheat" and "Animal-Drawn Farm Implements" have been determined to help farmers increase yield per unit area. The red bollworm is very harmful to increasing cotton production. "Cotton Red Bollworm" will tell the general audience the life secrets and control methods of the red bollworm through film images. Another film on agriculture is "Soybean Rhizobia," which explains how to increase soybean yield per unit area.

Regarding hygiene, there are topics such as "Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis," "Protecting Eyes," and "Vegetables and Nutrition." Other topics such as "Aquarium," "Traffic Safety," and "Agricultural Production Cooperatives" are also included in this year's plan.

The scripts for the science education films based on the above themes and topics that have been completed are "Rubber," "Mineral Exploration," "Overcoming High Temperatures in Factories," "Freshwater Fish Farming," "Close Planting of Wheat," "Soybean Rhizobia," "Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis," and "Aquarium." The creation of these scripts has received strong support from scientists in various fields. The production teams responsible for shooting these eight films have been established, some have already started shooting, and some are in preparation.

The science education films planned to be translated this year include "The Story of Magnet," "Vitamins in Animal Husbandry," "The Seven-Colored Flower," and "They Regained Their Sight," all of which are better films. These films will help the broad masses of our people learn the new scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences in industrial and agricultural production of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries.

    科学教育电影制片厂
    今年将摄制和翻译许多部科学教育影片
    为了运用电影直接为国家经济建设服务，中央人民政府文化部电影局科学教育电影制片厂决定在一九五四年创作科学教育电影剧本十八个，摄制科学教育影片十五部和四本“科学与技术”的新闻片，并翻译苏联和人民民主国家科学教育影片二十四部。
    科学教育影片制片厂今年的制片方针，仍以普及片为主，着重介绍基本科学知识，使一般观众了解工业建设的科学基础知识；并解决一些农业科学技术问题；另外也增加了关于水产、气象、地理及解释社会现象方面的题材。
    在工业建设方面，已选定的题材有“橡胶”、“怎样炼钢铁”、“找矿”、“平行流水作业法”及“战胜厂房高温”等五个主题。其中“橡胶”和“怎样炼钢铁”是属于解释工业建设的基本科学知识的，可以向一般观众说明橡胶和钢铁在工业建设上的重要作用；同时也向观众介绍了橡胶制造和钢铁生产的一些主要操作过程，使观众了解到关于橡胶、钢铁的生产上的基本科学道理。在基本建设方面，选定了“平行流水作业法”，以房屋建筑为背景，介绍了生产程序及各工种的合理组织方法，可以作为对建筑工人和技术人员的教学片。在重工业部门，工人们往往在一千多度的高温下进行生产，“战胜厂房高温”这个主题，以各企业厂矿在解决高温问题上的一些先进措施和办法为内容。“找矿”将说明我国的大冶地质勘探队在采用了苏联物理探矿和打深钻等先进经验后，如何在当地找到了矿藏。
    关于农业方面的有“淡水养鱼”、“小麦密植”、“马拉农具”、“棉花红蛉虫”等主题。我国淡水养鱼事业的历史非常悠久，经验丰富。影片“淡水养鱼”的主题，就是为使这些经验能够在我国广大的淡水湖泊、河流、池沼地区推广。另外在农业生产上，随着农业合作化的发展，农民对改进农业生产技术的要求日益增长，为适应这种要求，确定了“小麦密植”和“马拉农具”两个主题，以帮助农民提高单位面积产量。红蛉虫对棉花增产的危害很严重。“棉花红蛉虫”将把红蛉虫的生活秘密和防治方法通过电影形象告诉广大观众。农业方面另外还有一部“大豆根瘤菌”的影片，主题是说明提高大豆单位面积产量的。
    关于卫生方面，有“防治血吸虫病”、“保护眼睛”、“蔬菜与营养”等题材。其他如“水族馆”、“交通安全”、“农业生产合作社”等题材，也列入了今年计划。
    根据以上这些主题和题材创作的科学教育影片的剧本，已经完成的有“橡胶”、“找矿”、“战胜厂房高温”、“淡水养鱼”、“小麦密植”、“大豆根瘤菌”、“防治血吸虫病”、“水族馆”等八个。这些剧本的创作，得到各方面科学家大力的帮助。现在负责拍摄这八部影片的摄制组都已成立，有的已开始拍摄，有的正在进行准备。
    今年计划翻译的科学教育片，有“磁石的故事”、“维他命在畜牧业中”、“七采花”、“他们重见光明”等，都是较好的影片。这些影片将帮助我国广大群众学习苏联及人民民主国家的新的科学技术成就和工农业生产上的先进经验。
