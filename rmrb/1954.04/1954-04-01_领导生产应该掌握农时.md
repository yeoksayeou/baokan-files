    Leading Production Should Grasp the Farming Season
    Chen Chengzhong from Yishan District, Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, writes: The leading cadres of Pingyang County are not familiar with the farming season, and therefore often cannot lead production appropriately according to the production season. For example, when the county held a meeting of district and township cadres in early February this year to arrange spring plowing, the county leaders believed that there were still two and a half months before spring plowing. But in fact, here we start spring plowing three days before the Spring Equinox, which was only forty days away from the meeting.
    The county's agricultural and forestry department held an agricultural technology training class to promote advanced farming methods, stipulating that the county would organize it from March 5th to 10th, the district from March 15th to 20th, and the township only after March 20th. By the time it is implemented among the masses, it would be the end of March or the beginning of April. According to our local season, we start soaking seeds and spring plowing on March 18th, and after the 20th, it is the busy season for farming. At that time, no one will come to participate in the training class organized by the township. Even if someone comes to learn techniques such as salt water seed selection, it will be useless.
    This shortcoming of our county's leading cadres in leading production without considering the farming season has existed in the past. For example, in the spring of the year before last, when the farmers had already generally transplanted rice seedlings, the county began to arrange inspections of spring plowing preparations, investigating draft cattle, grain seeds, and so on. Last spring, when the farmers had already sown the seeds, the county emphasized making "combined seedling fields" and "sparse sowing," which led to mandatory measures at the grassroots level.
    Regarding the above situation, the township cadres and farmers have a lot of complaints. Although we have reported this to the leading comrades, it has not received due attention. It is hoped that the agricultural and forestry department of the Pingyang County People's Government will quickly overcome this shortcoming of not being able to grasp the farming season in leading production, so as to better lead the farmers to increase production.

### 领导生产应该掌握农时

专栏：读者来信摘要

    领导生产应该掌握农时
    浙江平阳县宜山区陈承中来信：平阳县领导干部对农时不熟悉，因此往往不能根据生产季节适时地领导生产。如今年二月上旬县里召开区、乡干部会议布置春耕生产时，县领导干部认为离春耕还有两个半月，但实际上我们这里是春分前三天开始春耕，距开会时只有四十天了。
    县农林科举办推广先进耕作法的农业技术训练班，规定三月五日至十日由县里办，三月十五日到二十日区里办，三月二十日以后乡里才能办，等贯彻到群众中去就是三月底或四月初了。根据我们这里的季节，三月十八日就开始浸种、春耕，二十日以后正是农事紧张季节。到那时乡里办训练班根本没人会来参加，就是有人来学了盐水选种等技术也用不上了。
    我县领导干部这种不根据农时领导生产的缺点，在以往就有。像前年春季，农民已经普遍插秧了，县里才布置检查春耕准备工作，调查耕牛、谷种等等。去年春季，农民已经播谷了，县里却强调做“合式秧田”、“落谷稀”，致使下面产生了强迫命令做法。
    对于以上情况，乡村干部和农民有满肚子意见。我们虽然向领导同志反映过，但并未引起应有的重视。希望平阳县人民政府农林部门迅速克服这种不能掌握农时领导生产的缺点，以更好地领导农民提高生产。
