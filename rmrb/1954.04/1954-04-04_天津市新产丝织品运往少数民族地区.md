    A batch of brightly colored silk fabrics from Tianjin were shipped to ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang, Yanbian, and Inner Mongolia in late March. This batch of silk fabrics included satin-backed crepe, 'Yanlaihong' (wild goose red), plain soft satin, 'Tianxiang' silk, and colored feather yarn. They were manufactured for the country by workers from eight private factories in Tianjin, including Meiya and Xinhua. In order to meet the needs of our fraternal ethnic peoples as soon as possible, the workers completed these orders on time or ahead of schedule. Workers at the Xinhua Silk Weaving Factory and other factories also worked hard to improve product quality and overcome defects such as "skipped stitches." Currently, some of these factories have signed second-quarter silk fabric order contracts with state-owned commercial departments. The colors and patterns of these silk fabrics will be more abundant and colorful than in the first quarter, and the quantity will increase by more than one and a half times compared to the first quarter.

    天津市新产丝织品运往少数民族地区
    三月下旬，天津市运了一批色彩鲜艳的丝织品到新疆、延边、内蒙古等少数民族地区。这批丝织品有缎背绉、雁来红，素软缎、天香绢和色羽纱等，是天津市私营美亚、新华等八个工厂的工人为国家制造的。工人们为了早日供应兄弟民族人民的需要，都按期或提前完成了这批订货任务。新华丝织厂等厂的工人还努力提高产品质量，克服了“跳线”等缺点。目前，这些工厂中有的又和国营商业部门签订了第二季度的丝织品订货合同。这些丝织品的花色将比第一季度更加丰富多采，数量比第一季度将增加一倍半以上。
