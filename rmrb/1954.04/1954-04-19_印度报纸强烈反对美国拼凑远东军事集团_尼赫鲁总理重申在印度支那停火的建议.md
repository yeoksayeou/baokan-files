Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 18th: Indian newspapers strongly condemn the United States' attempt to establish a military bloc in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.

    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on April 15th, pointing out that after Dulles's meeting with Eden in London, a statement was issued saying that a Southeast Asian military group would be established, and their excuse was to ensure peace and security in Asia. The editorial refuted this argument, saying: "It's strange that these guardians of Asian peace and security... don't even consider that the peace and security they are embarking on to consolidate and restore Western imperialist forces is deeply abhorred by the awakened Asia."

    The editorial pointed out that the US policy is not a guarantee of genuine peace and security in Asia, but has become a definite threat to Asian countries. "In Korea, the United States, along with its lackeys in the camp, virtually devastated the country. In Japan, the United States has created a situation in which Japan's true national interests are sacrificed for the West's anti-communist strategy. In Indochina, the United States is providing massive military aid to save the tottering French colonial rule. The United States is supporting the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Bao Dai puppet regimes only because these puppet regimes can help to defeat the communists. The Pakistani government has been lured to join hands with the United States in the anti-communist crusade. The same traps have been set in Middle Eastern countries—some countries have already fallen into the traps, the purpose of which is to establish a strategic encirclement of anti-communism on the Asian continent. A 'defense' plan similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is now being planned for Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. This Western policy, formulated under the instigation and guidance of the United States to prevent so-called communists from forcibly implementing their political systems in non-communist countries in Asia, is dangerously pushing the region onto a volcano."

    The editorial said: The "evil agreement" reached by Western countries on "joint action" is opening the way to another Korean War, and the hegemonic United States and its allies hope that the peace-loving people of Asia will walk down this road to destruction. This despicable conspiracy must be defeated by the people of Asia themselves.

    The "Tribune" published an editorial on April 15th, saying: "Asian countries, which are mainly concerned with the security of Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, will not agree to enter into any military alliance with Western countries, for two good reasons. First, such an alliance would mean the perpetuation of colonialism in Malaya and Indochina; second, it means expanding the conflict between East and West to Asia and is sure to drag the region into war."

     The "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on April 15th, pointing out:
  "Although independent public opinion around the world attaches great importance to the Geneva Conference - the first meeting of the five major powers to discuss the entire Far East situation, and everyone is eager to do everything possible to create a favorable atmosphere for the Geneva Conference, Dulles suddenly appeared with a deeply alarming identity." "Dulles is frantically engaged in activities that are bound to create mistrust and hostility. He is not trying to enable all parties to discuss peaceful solutions in a beneficial mood." The editorial said that the US policy "neither increases the hope of success for the Geneva Conference nor promotes peace in Indochina."

    The editorial said: "It is astonishing that Eden ignored the opposition of the vast British public to Dulles's actions—as expressed in the House of Commons itself—and almost agreed to a policy that threatens to undermine the Geneva Conference."

    TASS, Delhi, April 17th: Delhi Radio broadcast the news: Indian Deputy Minister of External Affairs Chanda read out Prime Minister Nehru's statement in the People's House on April 17th regarding the communique issued by Dulles on April 13th after the London talks. The communique stated that Britain and the United States were "prepared" to discuss plans to establish an organization similar to the North Atlantic Alliance in Southeast Asia. Nehru's statement said: The Indian government and the governments of the countries concerned have not exchanged or consulted on this issue. Nehru said: India's position is clear to everyone and remains unchanged. Nehru also said that India still suggests a ceasefire in Indochina, and believes that this "will open the way for further negotiations."

### 印度报纸强烈反对美国拼凑远东军事集团  尼赫鲁总理重申在印度支那停火的建议

    印度报纸强烈反对美国拼凑远东军事集团
    尼赫鲁总理重申在印度支那停火的建议
      【新华社新德里十八日电】印度报纸强烈谴责美国企图建立东南亚及西太平洋军事集团的阴谋。
    “甘露市场报”四月十五日发表社论，指出杜勒斯与艾登伦敦会谈后发表声明说要建立东南亚军事集团，他们的借口是所谓确保亚洲和平及安全。社论驳斥这种论调说：“真够奇怪的，这些亚洲和平及安全的捍卫者……也不考虑一下，他们为了巩固地恢复西方帝国主义势力而着手要建立的这种和平及安全，是觉悟了的亚洲所深恶痛绝的。”
    社论指出：美国政策不是亚洲真正和平及安全的保障，而成为对亚洲国家的肯定的威胁了。“在朝鲜，美国和它的阵营中的仆从们一起，实际上使这个国家遭到破坏。在日本，美国制造了一种为了西方的反共战略而牺牲日本真正民族利益的局势。在印度支那，美国正提供大量的军事援助来挽救摇摇欲坠的法国殖民统治。美国正在支持蒋介石、李承晚和保大傀儡政权，只是因为这些傀儡政权可以帮助来击败共产党。巴基斯坦政府已被诱在反共的十字军运动中和美国携手。在中东国家中也设下了同样的圈套——有些国家已经落入圈套，这些圈套的目的是要在亚洲大陆建立反共的战略包围圈。现在正在为东南亚和西太平洋地区策划一个和北大西洋公约组织类似的‘防御’计划。这种在美国的授意和指导下，为防止所谓共产党强行在亚洲非共产党国家实行他们的政治制度而制定的西方国家政策，是在危险地把这个地区推上火山。”
    社论说：西方国家就“联合行动”“达成的邪恶协议，是开辟走向另一个朝鲜战争的道路，霸权狂的美国和它的盟国希望爱好和平的亚洲人民沿着这条道路走向毁灭。这种卑鄙的阴谋必须由亚洲人民自己来予以击败。”
    “论坛报”四月十五日发表社论说：“与东南亚和西太平洋的安全主要有关的亚洲国家，将不会同意与西方国家订立任何军事同盟，这有两个很好的理由。第一，这样的同盟将意味着马来亚和印度支那的殖民主义永久化，其次，它意味着把东西方的冲突扩大到亚洲来，并一定会把这一区域拖入战争。”
      “印度斯坦时报”四月十五日发表社论指出：
  “虽然全世界的独立舆论都异常重视日内瓦会议——这是五大国第一次坐在一起讨论整个的远东局势的会议，并且，大家都渴望尽一切可能为日内瓦会议创造有利的气氛，但是杜勒斯却突然以一种引起人们深切焦虑的身份出现了。”“杜勒斯狂热地在从事于那种一定会造成互不相信和敌意的活动，他不是为了使各方面能一同在有益的心情中讨论和平解决。”社论说：美国的政策“既不是增加日内瓦会议成功的希望，又不是促进印度支那的和平”。
    社论说：“令人惊异的是，艾登居然不顾英国广大舆论对杜勒斯的行动的反对——就像下院本身所表现出来的那样——而差不多同意了那种威胁着要破坏日内瓦会议的政策。”
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社德里十七日讯：德里电台广播消息：印度外交部副部长钱达十七日在人民院宣读了尼赫鲁总理就杜勒斯在伦敦会谈结束后于四月十三日发表的公报所作的声明。该公报中表明：英国和美国“准备”讨论在东南亚建立一个类似北大西洋联盟的组织的计划。尼赫鲁的声明中说：印度政府和有关国家政府之间对这一问题没有作过任何的意见交换或协商。尼赫鲁说：印度的立场是大家都很清楚的，并且仍然不变。尼赫鲁又说：印度仍然建议在印度支那停火，并认为这样“才能打开进一步谈判的道路”。
