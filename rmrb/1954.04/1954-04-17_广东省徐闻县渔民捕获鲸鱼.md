On the morning of March 14th, at a little after 3 a.m., 22 fishing boats from the whaling team of Wai Luo Port, Xuwen County, Guangdong Province, set sail. At 7 a.m., they spotted a mother whale and its calf spouting water in the fishing grounds, and the entire team of fishing boats immediately surrounded and chased them. After chasing for three hours, Yang Mao-xiang's boat approached the calf whale and fired a harpoon. After being harpooned, the calf whale struggled violently, dragging the boat along. Soon, Lin De-fang's boat caught up and fired a second harpoon. The calf whale continued to struggle. Later, Yang Guo-cun's boat fired a third harpoon, finally controlling the calf whale. After the calf whale exhausted its strength, these three boats towed it back to Wai Luo Port.

    广东省徐闻县渔民捕获鲸鱼
    三月十四日早上三点多钟，广东省徐闻县外罗港捕鲸队二十二艘渔船扬帆出海。上午七点钟，在渔场上远远看见一对子母鲸在喷着水，全队渔船立即包围追捕。追了三个钟头，杨茂祥的船逼近子鲸，发出镖枪。子鲸中镖后奋力挣扎，把船拖着走。不久，林德芳的船赶上来，发出第二镖。子鲸仍然挣扎着。后来由杨国存的船上发出第三镖，才把子鲸控制住。等子鲸气力使尽了，这三条船就把它拖回外罗港。
