    Anhui Province Commercial Departments Transfer Industrial Products to Supply Tea Farmers' Needs
    Hebei Province Grain Departments and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Actively Supply Farmers with Grain
    The state-owned commercial departments of Anhui Province are transferring a large number of goods to supply the needs of tea farmers. In the second quarter of this year, state-owned cotton yarn companies in key tea-producing areas such as Tunxi City and Lu'an County plan to supply tea farmers with approximately four times more cloth than in the same period last year; tea-producing areas in Wuhu and Anqing will increase by nearly three and a half times. The variety and specifications of the cloth will also strive to meet the preferences of tea farmers. At the same time, department stores in various regions have also prepared sufficient general merchandise such as towels and socks, as well as rubber shoes, enamelware, and bamboo-cased water bottles suitable for tea farmers' needs. Tunxi City Department Store conducted in-depth investigations and research on the customary needs of tea farmers, expanded the variety of goods favored by tea farmers, and prepared round yarn belts, mesh bags, and black hairpins used by women, which were not previously sold. To meet the needs of tea areas for baking tea at night, a large amount of kerosene has also been prepared.
    These goods have now begun to be continuously transported to tea areas such as Tunxi, Lu'an, Shexian, Wuhu, and Anqing. Lu'an County Department Store has fully allocated the sheet metal (for making tea buckets), undershirts, socks, summer cloth, etc., organized by the Bengbu Department Store Supply Station to the tea areas. Xuan County Department Store, based on the inconvenient transportation situation in the Xikou tea-producing area, decided to set up temporary sales teams for supply. The store is now gradually transporting goods to the area to supply the needs of tea farmers.

    Grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province are actively supplying grain to farmers who lack grain. In planned supply, various regions have also added and adjusted grain supply points. There are now 3,499 grain supply points in the province, an increase of 1,000 compared to before the implementation of planned grain purchase and planned supply.
    The province has paid more attention to the grain supply of farmers in cash crop areas and some areas affected by floods. Handan Prefecture is a cotton-producing area, and 4.75 million jin of grain were supplied to cotton farmers in February. From March 10th to 15th, Wu'an County statistically supplied an average of 230,000 jin of various grains to cotton farmers every day. Cang County Prefecture was severely affected by floods, and a total of 68.73 million jin of grain were supplied to farmers in March. While supplying grain to disaster victims, a large amount of grain was also allocated to support disaster victims in developing sideline production. Dacheng and Wuqing counties alone supplied more than 1.99 million jin of red sorghum and more than 520,000 jin of soybeans before and after.
    In order to further improve rural grain supply work and not delay farmers' production, grain supply points in various regions have recently implemented a "continuous shift system" work method. The results of the implementation in various regions have greatly facilitated farmers. Due to the province's vigorous efforts in grain planned supply work, farmers have a clearer understanding of the significance of the state's implementation of planned grain purchase and planned supply.

    安徽省商业部门调运工业品供应茶农需要
    河北省粮食部门和供销合作社积极供应农民粮食
    安徽省国营商业部门正调运大批货物供应茶农的需要。今年第二季度，屯溪市、六安县等重点茶区的国营花纱布公司计划供应茶农的布匹，比去年同期增加了四倍左右；芜湖、安庆茶区增加了近三倍半。在布匹的品种和规格上，也尽量满足了茶农的喜爱。同时，各地百货公司还准备了充足的毛巾、袜子等一般百货商品，以及适合于茶农需要的胶鞋、搪瓷、竹壳水瓶等。屯溪市百货商店深入调查研究了茶农的习惯需要，扩大了茶农喜爱的商品品种，准备了过去没有经营的圆纱带、网袋等，和妇女们爱用的黑色发夹。为了适应茶区晚间烘茶的需要，还准备了大量的煤油。
    现在这些商品已开始源源运往屯溪、六安、歙县、芜湖、安庆等茶区。六安县百货商店向蚌埠百货供应站组织的白铁皮（做茶桶用）、汗衫、袜子、夏季布匹等，已全部分别调配到茶区。宣城县百货商店根据溪口产茶区交通不便的情况，决定设置临时推销组进行供应。现该店正陆续将货物运往该地以供应茶农需要。

    河北省各地粮食部门和供销合作社积极供应缺粮农民粮食。在计划供应中，各地并增设和调整了供应粮食点。现在全省有三千四百九十九个粮食供应点，较实行粮食计划收购和计划供应前增加了一千个。
    该省对经济作物区和部分遭受水灾地区的农民粮食供应更为重视。邯郸专区是个产棉区，二月份供给了棉农四百七十五万斤粮食。武安县三月十日到十五日的统计，每天平均供给棉农各种粮食二十三万斤。沧县专区受水灾较重，三月份一共供应给农民六千八百七十三万斤粮食。在供应灾民粮食的同时，并拨出了大批粮食支持灾民开展副业生产。只大城、武清两县前后就供应了一百九十九万余斤红粮、五十二万余斤吉豆。
    为进一步做好农村粮食供应工作，不耽误农民生产，最近各地粮食供应点实行“连带上班制”工作方法，各地实行结果大大便利了农民。由于该省大力做好了粮食计划供应工作，使农民更清楚地认识到国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应的意义。  （郭君儒）
