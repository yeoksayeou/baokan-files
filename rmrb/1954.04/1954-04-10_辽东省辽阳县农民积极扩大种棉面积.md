Farmers in the key cotton-producing areas of Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, have generally increased their enthusiasm for cotton planting after studying the General Line and the state's commencement of grain supply. According to preliminary statistics, the county plans to plant more than 11,500 hectares of cotton, exceeding last year's sown area by more than 40 percent. To ensure the expansion of cotton fields, the Liaoyang County People's Government has prepared a large quantity of cotton seeds and means of production. To date, 800,000 jin of cotton seeds have been distributed to farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas stored a large amount of grain early on and conducted thorough and detailed investigations into the farmers' grain shortages. They have now begun planned grain supply work.

The increased enthusiasm of farmers in Liaoyang County for cotton planting is greatly related to the planned grain supply. In the past, farmers had to first consider whether they had enough grain to eat when planting cotton. Even if the soil was very suitable for cotton planting, they had to plant enough food crops first before planting cotton. This year, after the state implemented planned grain supply, farmers were relieved of concerns about grain price fluctuations and were able to plant cotton boldly and confidently. In previous years, during the preparations for spring planting, grain-deficient households had to run around everywhere to raise money to buy food. This year, they are using all their time for production, actively selecting seeds, accumulating manure, buying means of production, and consolidating mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Many villages, cooperatives, and mutual aid teams have selected cotton seeds, prepared fertilizers, and bought ammonium sulfate, and are now finalizing land preparation, ready to begin sowing soon.

    辽东省辽阳县农民积极扩大种棉面积
    辽东省辽阳县几个重点产棉区的农民，经过学习总路线和国家开始粮食供应以后，种棉积极性普遍提高。据初步统计，全县准备种棉一万一千五百多垧，超过去年播种面积百分之四十以上。辽阳县人民政府为了保证扩大棉田，准备了大批棉籽和生产资料等，目前发到农民手中的棉籽已有八十万斤。棉区的供销合作社很早就储备了大批粮食，并深入细致地了解了农民的缺粮情况，现在已经开始了粮食计划供应工作。
    辽阳县农民植棉积极性的提高与粮食计划供应有很大关系，过去农民种棉时首先要考虑吃粮够不够，虽然土质很适合种棉，也必须先把食粮种够，然后才种棉花。今年国家对粮食实行计划供应后，农民解除了粮价波动的顾虑，放心大胆地种棉花。往年在备耕时期，缺粮户要东奔西跑到处筹购食粮，今年，他们把所有时间都用在生产上，积极进行选种、关粪、买生产资料和整顿互助合作组织等工作。很多村、社和互助组都已粒选了棉籽，准备了肥料，买了硫铵，现正在最后整地，即将开始播种。　（陈　昌）
