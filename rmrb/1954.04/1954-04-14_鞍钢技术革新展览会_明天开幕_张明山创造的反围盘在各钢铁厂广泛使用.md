Xinhua News Agency, April 13th - The "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition" is scheduled to officially open on April 15th. The exhibition began preparations in October last year. During the preparation period, Anshan Iron and Steel Company manufactured all the models for the exhibition and sent nearly a hundred workers and technicians to assist in the installation of the exhibits. As the exhibition's preparatory work neared completion, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also invited Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Li Lisan, Minister of Labor of the Central People's Government, Wang Heshou, Minister of Heavy Industry, and Lu Dong, Deputy Minister, to view the main exhibits. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Secretaries of the Secretariat Xu Zhizhen, Liu Ziju, Li Jiebo, and Dong Xin also personally participated in the review of the main exhibits.

Xinhua News Agency, April 13th - The "reverse winding disk" invented by Zhang Mingshan of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Rolling Mill has been promoted to the small rolling mill departments of major steel plants across the country. To date, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Daye Steel Plant, and New Shanghai Steel Plant, among others, have installed "reverse winding disks" and various winding disk equipment.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully trial-produced the "forward winding disk" last year. Using this type of winding disk to roll steel can save thirty-six labor hours per day for two shifts and double the efficiency of rolling even iron. Last year, the First Branch of the Tianjin Steel Plant successfully trial-produced three types of winding disks for rolling steel below 12 cm: forward winding disk, reverse winding disk, and vertical winding disk. After installing these winding disks, the plant greatly improved steel rolling efficiency and completely changed the previously manual operation procedures to mechanical operation. Workers at the local state-owned Tianjin Rolling Mill installed "forward winding disks" and "reverse winding disks" using waste materials. After using the "reverse winding disk" for production, output increased by 30%, accidents involving burns were avoided, and two hook pullers and two machine operators could be reduced. The Rolling Mill Department of the Tangshan Steel Plant also installed "forward winding disks" and "reverse winding disks" in July last year, increasing production efficiency by 16%.

For more than a year, inspired and enlightened by Zhang Mingshan's innovation campaign, employees of steel plants across the country have made many new creations, resulting in the development of winding disk equipment. After successfully manufacturing "forward winding disks" and "reverse winding disks," the Rolling Mill Workshop of the Daye Steel Plant successfully trial-produced "reverse vertical winding disks." The "three-roller transverse" rolling mill used by the Rolling Mill Workshop of the Daye Steel Plant has two rolling grooves. If only "forward winding disks" and "reverse winding disks" are installed, only one rolling groove can be used. With the "reverse vertical winding disk," the rolling grooves of the "three-roller transverse" rolling mill can be fully utilized. In addition, 30 to 40 labor hours can be saved every day, and the feeding time is also reduced from seven seconds to half a second. In March of this year, the Tianjin Steel Plant successfully developed a "double-groove winding disk" that feeds two steels simultaneously, increasing daily output by 21%.

    “鞍钢技术革新展览会”明天开幕
    张明山创造的反围盘在各钢铁厂广泛使用
    【新华社十三日讯】“鞍钢技术革新展览会”定于四月十五日正式开幕。这个展览会是从去年十月开始筹备的。筹备期间，鞍山钢铁公司为展览会制造了全部模型，并派来了近百名工人和技术人员，协助展览会进行展品模型的安装工作。展览会筹备工作接近结束时，中华全国总工会还邀请了国家计划委员会副主席李富春、中央人民政府劳动部部长李立三、重工业部部长王鹤寿、副部长吕东等，观看了展览会的主要展品。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，书记处书记许之桢、刘子久、李颉伯、董昕等，也亲自参加了对主要展品的审查工作。
    【新华社十三日讯】鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂张明山创造的“反围盘”，已在各地主要钢铁厂的小型轧钢部门推广。到目前为止，安装了“反围盘”和各种围盘设备的有太原钢铁厂、天津钢厂、唐山钢厂、大冶钢厂、新沪钢铁厂等。
    太原钢铁厂在去年试制“正围盘”成功。利用这种围盘轧制钢材，两班每天可以节省人工三十六个，并使轧制匀铁的效率提高一倍。天津钢厂一分厂去年试制成功了轧制十二糎以下钢材的正围盘、反围盘和立围盘等三种围盘。该厂安装这种围盘后，轧钢效率大大提高，并把过去人工操作的程序完全改变为机械操作。地方国营天津轧钢厂的职工，利用废料安装了“正围盘”和“反围盘”。使用“反围盘”生产后，产量提高了百分之三十，避免了烫伤事故，并可减少两个拉勾工人和两个看机器的工人。唐山钢厂轧钢部去年七月份也安装了“正围盘”和“反围盘”，使生产效率提高了百分之十六。
    一年多以来，各地钢铁厂职工在张明山革新行动的鼓舞和启示下，出现了许多新的创造，使围盘设备得到了发展。大冶钢厂轧钢车间制造“正围盘”和“反围盘”成功后，又试制成功了“反立围盘”。大冶钢厂轧钢车间使用的“三辊横列式”轧钢机上有两道轧槽，如果只装置“正围盘”和“反围盘”，就只能使用一道轧槽，有了“反立围盘”以后，“三辊横列式”轧钢机的轧槽就可以充分利用了。此外，每天还可以节省三十到四十个劳动力，而且喂钢的时间也从七秒钟缩短到半秒钟。今年三月，天津钢厂研究出了同时走两根钢的“双槽围盘”成功，使日产量提高了百分之二十一。
