    The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau Issues Second Quarter Industrial Production Instructions
    Mobilize Workers to Discuss National Plans
    Push Labor Competitions to a New Climax Before May Day
    [Report from this newspaper] On April 9th, the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau instructed Party committees at all levels to continue adopting effective measures to ensure that the second quarter's production significantly advances on the basis of the first quarter. It demanded that the second quarter's total industrial output value for the entire region complete 27 percent of the annual plan and comprehensively fulfill all economic indicators.
    The instruction first analyzed the industrial production situation in the North China region in the second quarter, pointing out that due to the thorough implementation of the General Line and the transmission of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers would inevitably be further enhanced. In addition, the second quarter has four more working days than the first quarter, better weather conditions, and coincides with the upcoming "May Day" International Labor Day and the communication of the North China Bureau's industrial meeting. As long as leadership is firmly grasped, the increase production and practice economy labor competition is pushed to a new climax before the "May Day" holiday, and combined with enterprise management and the promotion of advanced experience, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the above requirements.
    The instruction requested that Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the spirit of the North China Bureau's Industrial Work Conference held in March this year, mobilize workers to discuss the national plan (for factories and mines where the national plan has not yet been issued, discussions can be conducted according to the control targets of the ministries and bureaus), and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy and technical organizational measures plans based on needs and possibilities. On this basis, trade unions and administrations should be organized to sign collective contracts as the goals for conducting labor competitions throughout the year. The discussion of plans should implement the principle of discussing while acting, ensuring that the discussion of plans is closely linked to improving current work and solving key problems. For factories that failed to complete their plans in the past and factories that did not fully achieve their targets, thorough inspections should be conducted to identify the root causes and make improvements.
    The instruction stated: Recently, many units in Beijing and Hebei Province, using the spirit of the General Line and the resolutions of the North China Industrial Conference, first started by having the leading cadres of the Party and administration examine their conservative and complacent sentiments and the influence of bourgeois ideology in various tasks, and then breaking through ideological barriers layer by layer. As a result, their thinking became clear, their eyes brightened, and they saw that there was great potential in all aspects of existing enterprises, and all units automatically proposed plans to increase production and practice economy. The instruction required all localities to accept this experience in order to promote work in all areas.
    In view of the increasing trend of accidents in the first quarter and the ease with which diseases can spread in the second quarter, the instruction emphasized: Implementing the policy of safe production and strengthening safety and health work are of particular importance to ensuring normal production and normal attendance in the second quarter. All cities should hold safety and health conferences to inspect and deploy this work. All industrial administrative bureaus should, based on the characteristics of their industries, deploy and promote the safety production experiences of their systems.
    The instruction also pointed out that for units with insufficient production tasks or difficulties in the supply of raw materials, the provincial and municipal committees should instruct the financial and trade commissions and trade departments to help factories and mines solve problems from the aspects of material allocation, material adjustment, and organizing production collaboration. It is necessary to mobilize the initiative and creativity of all workers, save raw materials, use substitutes, and solve new problems caused by changes in raw materials.

    中共中央华北局发出第二季工业生产指示
    发动职工讨论国家计划
    把劳动竞赛在“五一”前引向新的高潮
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局在四月九日指示各级党委继续采取有效措施，保证第二季度的生产在第一季度的基础上大大前进一步，要求第二季度全区工业总产值完成全年计划的百分之二十七，并全面完成各项经济指标。
    指示首先分析了华北地区第二季度工业生产情况，指出由于总路线的深入贯彻，党的七届四中全会的传达，广大职工的觉悟和劳动热忱必将更加提高；再加上第二季度比第一季度多四个工作日，气候条件较好，又正当“五一”国际劳动节的来临和华北局工业会议的传达，只要抓紧领导，把增产节约劳动竞赛在“五一”节前引向新的高潮，并结合企业管理和先进经验的推广，完成和超额完成以上要求是有充分的可能的。
    指示要求各级党委根据今年三月华北局工业工作会议的精神，发动职工讨论国家计划（国家计划还未下达的厂矿，可按部、局控制指标进行讨论），并根据需要与可能制定增产节约计划和技术组织措施计划。在这个基础上，组织工会和行政签订集体合同，作为全年进行劳动竞赛的奋斗目标。讨论计划中要贯彻边讨论边行动的方针，务使讨论计划和改进当前工作、解决关键问题紧紧地结合起来。对过去没有完成计划的厂和完成指标不全面的厂，要切实检查，找出症结所在，加以改进。
    指示说：最近北京市和河北省的许多单位，以总路线的精神和华北工业会议决议，首先从党和行政的领导干部检查在各项工作中保守自满情绪和资产阶级的思想影响，然后层层打通思想，于是思想上开了窍，眼睛亮了，看到现有企业中各方面都有很大潜力，各单位都自动提出了增产节约计划。指示要求各地必须接受这一经验，以推进各方面的工作。
    鉴于第一季度事故增加的趋势和第二季度疾病又容易流行的情况，指示着重指出：贯彻安全生产的方针，加强安全卫生工作，对保证第二季度正常生产和正常出勤有特别重要的意义。各市应召开安全卫生会议来检查和布置这一工作。各工业管理局要根据本产业的特点，布置推广本系统的安全生产经验。
    指示还指出，对生产任务不足或原材料供应有困难的单位，各省、市委要责成财委及贸易部门，从物资调拨、材料调剂、组织生产协作等方面帮助厂矿加以解决。要发动全体职工的积极性、创造性，节约原材料、采用代用品，解决因原材料变换所引起的新问题。
