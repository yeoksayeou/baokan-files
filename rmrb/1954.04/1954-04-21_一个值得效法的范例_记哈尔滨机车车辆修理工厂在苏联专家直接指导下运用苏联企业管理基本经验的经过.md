    An Example Worth Emulating
    ——Recording the Experience of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Applying the Basic Experience of Soviet Enterprise Management Under the Direct Guidance of Soviet Experts
    By Our Correspondent An Gang
    The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, located on the banks of the Songhua River and with a history of more than fifty years, is a large-scale, comprehensive factory with complex products. In May 1950, the Soviet government sent twenty-seven experts to participate in the work in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the agreement on joint management of the Chinese Changchun Railway signed on the basis of the treaty. Chinese and Soviet comrades, on the basis of friendly cooperation, took turns serving as the factory director, deputy factory director, section chiefs, and main workshop directors, in accordance with the principle of equal employment of personnel. The joint management lasted for two years and eight months. The most important task undertaken by the factory during this period was to learn from the Soviet Union in an all-round way and apply the advanced socialist enterprise management principles and methods to make the factory an advanced factory.
    From May 1, 1950, under the direct guidance of Soviet experts, the factory began enterprise reform work. The goal of the reform was to promote the economic accounting system on the basis of the original work (before the joint management, the factory had carried out democratic reforms, and factory management had a preliminary planned production and cost accounting system) in accordance with the socialist enterprise management principles. Soviet experts believed that in order to make the factory a model enterprise, it was necessary to complete and overfulfill the state's production and financial plans in accordance with the principles of the economic accounting system. Correctly applying the economic accounting system, a method of planned economic leadership, can eliminate the deeply rooted "only ask for production, regardless of cost, and not counting accumulation" supply system thinking in the minds of the factory comrades at that time, establish a conscientious and comprehensive management of production, careful calculation, cherish every penny of the country's thinking, ensure that various products are handed over to the country according to the plan, and at the same time, the results of all production and economic activities of the factory guarantee that more is handed over to the country than the amount allocated to the enterprise by the state; the actual expenditure is lower than the planned expenditure, ensuring that the enterprise does not suffer financial losses, and accumulating funds for the country.
    Where to start?
    The goal of the reform has been determined, where to start?
    The factory started with the implementation of the economic accounting system. In the process of changing to an economic accounting unit, the following measures were taken: 1. comprehensively reformed the organizational structure, reduced a large number of administrative management personnel, implemented new staffing tables and various work rules and job manuals, and transformed the multi-headed leadership and no-one-responsible organizational structure into an organization that faces production, has single leadership, is responsible at each level, and is easy to implement the economic accounting system; 2. formulate and implement production and financial plans, including production plans, product cost plans, labor and wage plans, material supply plans, technical organizational measures plans, financial plans, product cost plans, basic construction and overhaul plans. This is the basis for the factory to implement comprehensive planned management, and it is also the program of action for all employees; 3. clear up fixed assets and determine the quota of working capital, and the factory implements independent operations within the scope of funds allocated by the state; 4. implement the piece-rate wage system; 5. reform the accounting calculation system and establish an internal original statistics and document turnover system; 6. the Audit Bureau of the Chinese Changchun Railway established an audit office in the factory to comprehensively supervise the factory's daily production and financial activities; 7. convene a final accounting committee to organize the inspection of the results of the factory's production and financial activities.
    As a result of the initial implementation of the economic accounting system, the factory has undergone profound changes: the entire enterprise activity is completely under strict supervision of planned income and expenditure, all planned tasks are only allowed to be completed and not allowed to be uncompleted, all planned funds are only allowed to be reduced and not allowed to be overspent, and enterprise leaders and all employees think of every way to comprehensively complete the state plan. Because, if only the production task is completed and the working capital is accumulated, the factory's financial work will be difficult; if only attention is paid to compressing the working capital and the completion of the production task is ignored, the factory's products will be insufficient, the income will be reduced, and the production cannot be continued; the production task is completed, and the quota of working capital is determined reasonably, but the product quality is not good, and the orderer requires rework or devaluation (first-class products become second-class products), and the result is still that the money cannot be recovered in time, affecting the capital turnover and cannot continue production. The production and financial plan implemented in accordance with the principles of the economic accounting system is a comprehensive plan, which requires the factory not only to complete the production plan, but also to complete the financial plan at the same time, not only to complete the total output value, but also to complete the product plan in a balanced manner, and to systematically improve the product quality. Only by comprehensively, completely, and organically completing all the indicators of the state plan can the enterprise accelerate the turnover of funds, continuously improve productivity, and accumulate funds. In the specific measures of changing the factory into an economic accounting unit, it is clearly stipulated that the method of combining the factory's centralized planned leadership with strict statistical supervision should be adopted. Daily effective supervision is the fundamental method to ensure that the enterprise comprehensively completes the state plan. The factory must carry out any work (including buying a few teacups) according to the plan. Work without a plan and without a source of funds cannot and is not allowed to be done. Plans and various original vouchers are the basis for implementing supervision. Supervision is multi-faceted: First, establish an independent accounting system, adopt new accounting subjects and balance sheets, and prepare monthly, quarterly, and annual final accounts to comprehensively reflect the operating results of the entire enterprise. The factory's chief accountant has the same responsibility as the factory director in ensuring the supervision of the factory's financial activities; second, establish an audit system, and the resident auditor comprehensively supervises the factory's daily cash expenditure, treasury inventory, clearing of accounts receivable, wage payment, material consumption, product sales, and all activities related to economic accounting, and all unplanned expenditures are not approved; third, establish an annual property inventory and registration system to find out the factory's protection of state property, and at the same time grasp the comparison between the working capital quota and the actual funds, review the real results of the factory's production and economic activities, and at the same time regularly convene factory-wide and workshop final accounting meetings to systematically analyze and supervise enterprise activities, and formulate specific measures to improve the factory's production and financial activities.
    Based on the comprehensive production and financial plan, the use of the economic accounting system, a method of planned leadership of the economy, to comprehensively carry out the work, so that the factory's large machine can rotate flexibly, is the basic characteristic of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to implement socialist enterprise management.
    Starting from this, the normal order of factory production was established. The factory implemented a planned management system internally. The production and financial plan is the basis of the employees' activities, and the production operation plan is its continuation. The content of the operation plan includes making production preparations, compiling monthly, ten-day, and daily operation plans, and production scheduling work. These two plans constitute the factory's entire planned management system. The factory overcomes the past problem of "doing whatever you encounter" through the operation plan, carries out production according to the plan every day, and discovers and improves all the bad phenomena in production and finance in a timely manner. Planned management has become a weapon for mobilizing the masses to create new quotas, explore various potential human and material resources, save labor, materials, fuel and other expenses, and fight against various production losses. Under the direct leadership of Soviet experts, the factory realized the correct direction of "everything for production": non-production personnel were reduced, various cumbersome procedures and organizational levels were simplified, meetings were greatly reduced except for the prescribed daily meetings and scheduling meetings, workers were not allowed to do non-production work during production time, and the phenomenon of temporary conscription and meetings disappeared. Everyone is no longer "doing their own thing," but is moving forward together according to the goal of completing and overfulfilling the production and financial plan.
    But it is not enough to have only plans and a planned management system. Plans and systems can only become a material force when combined with the conscious labor of employees. Every year after the plan is determined, the administration and the trade union jointly sign a collective contract. Mass labor competitions have become the fundamental method for employees to ensure the completion of the annual production and financial plans and production operation plans. In the principles of socialist enterprise management, competition is comprehensive, lasting, and frequent. It changed the way of using organized competitions to temporarily rush to complete a certain task, and competition became a means for the masses to master various advanced work methods and comprehensively realize the plan.
    Several Tasks Done Simultaneously
    The Soviet experts' method of leading production was not to engage in a movement for a period of time, nor to equate production work with other work (such as the Marriage Law). They relied on single leadership and responsibility at each level, simultaneously promoting, comprehensively advancing, and gradually improving. All work was closely combined with the leadership and the masses, and the plan was closely combined with supervision and inspection. All work was carried out in accordance with normal production order.
    During the Chinese Changchun Railway period, Soviet experts and Chinese employees carried out seven tasks in the factory according to the above goals, measures, systems, and methods. These tasks constituted the whole of enterprise production, and it was an interconnected part of the factory's large machine activities. Soviet experts established advanced socialist ideas, working methods, and systems in their actual work.
      Complete and Overfulfill the Production Plan
    The first major event that the factory did was to complete and overfulfill the state's production plan. The completion of the production plan is the most important indicator of the factory's activities. Soviet experts led all employees to resolutely carry out production in accordance with the needs of the state, and unconditionally and resolutely complete all product types and quantities stipulated by the state. In the past, some people liked to pick easy tasks and do them, and do less or even not do the tasks that were difficult to do. This practice is absolutely not allowed. The temporary production tasks assigned to the factory by the state must be accepted and guaranteed to be completed even if the factory has difficulties, and the normal production plan must be resolutely completed at the same time. Soviet comrades never emphasized objective difficulties in their work, but explored potential from various internal aspects to ensure the completion of the plan. During the Chinese Changchun Railway period, the factory's output increased year by year. Taking the monthly average planned figure in 1950 as 100, it was 128.6 in 1951 and 191.5 in 1952; the actual completion of the production plan: 122 in 1950, 124.3 in 1951, and 199.6 in 1952. The main method for the factory to complete the production plan is to implement a daily production dynamic analysis table, arrange progress according to the operation plan, and ensure balanced production. If the mechanical workshop did not process according to the production progress schedule, as a result, one workshop accumulated two-thirds of the factory's work-in-process working capital. Soviet experts organized all employees to strictly abide by the product production cycle progress schedule, and implemented advanced work methods to shorten the production cycle and improve quality. The working capital in work-in-process was compressed to the normal quota within three months. This method of balanced production is comprehensive rather than isolated. It not only consolidated the normal production order, but also became an important means to improve product quality, shorten the production cycle, and accelerate capital turnover.
      Complete and Overfulfill the Financial Plan
    The second major event is to complete and overfulfill the financial plan while completing the production plan. After the factory became an economic accounting unit, the state allocated a certain amount of fixed assets and working capital to the factory for independent operation. All production and economic activities of the factory are completely under strict capital supervision. Soviet experts helped Chinese comrades learn to consciously use the law of value to influence production. As Comrade Stalin said: "In our enterprises, such issues as economic accounting and profitability, cost issues, price issues, etc., have practical significance. Therefore, our enterprises cannot and should not fail to consider the law of value." (Soviet Socialist Economic Problems) The factory must carefully calculate everything it does, and reduce expenditures as much as possible, even a penny must be saved. If you lose money, you cannot be considered to have comprehensively completed the state plan. In order to complete the financial plan, we must first correct the harmful ideas of "the production plan must be completed, the financial plan can be relaxed" and "completing the task does not count." At that time, the factory accumulated a large number of materials. For example, in order to save trouble, the material department bought five tons of sulfuric acid at one time, which was enough for eight years. Similar phenomena were numerous. The leadership conducted ideological education on employees to cherish state property and implement the economic accounting system, and on the one hand, organized an internal capital mobilization committee headed by Soviet factory director Khrizhevich to clear and register commodities, materials, work-in-process, and black materials, and compress all over-quota materials and parts, so that the factory's working capital was reduced from 76.5 billion yuan actually surplus on May 1, 1950 to 26.5 billion yuan in 1952, freeing up a large amount of capital for expanded production. At the same time, it established strict financial discipline, planned discipline, and a balance sheet final accounting analysis system, and established a system of settling accounts with orderers on time, changing the past phenomenon of forgetting to ask for money after delivering the goods. In addition, the audit system also played an extremely important role in ensuring the supervision of the factory's implementation of the economic accounting system without wasting a penny. As a result of the above series of measures, the factory's financial situation improved year by year. During the two years and eight months, the factory did not experience financial difficulties, nor did it borrow a penny from the bank. They accumulated funds by mobilizing internal expansion of production. In 1950, the factory's enterprise accumulation accounted for 21.7% of the total annual output value, 29% in 1951, and 35.4% in 1952. The total output value and total commodity value stipulated by the state were overfulfilled.
      Systematically Reduce Costs
    The third major event is to systematically reduce product costs, accurately analyze and calculate the factors constituting the cost of each product, and save labor, materials, fuel, electricity and other expenses by all means. The factory established a principle: to produce the most and best finished products with the smallest but also the most reasonable labor and materials; costs are only allowed to be reduced and not allowed to be overspent, and if costs are overspent, it will be impossible to pay wages and purchase raw materials and fuel, making all plans fall through. Reducing costs is also the main source of accumulating funds. For example, material costs account for 70% of all cost expenses. The factory adopts various methods to save materials, implements the method of processing and reusing old parts, utilizes waste materials, replaces copper castings with steel castings, and carries out mass movements to utilize waste materials, resulting in a year-by-year reduction in product costs. People began to establish the idea of reducing costs and implementing the economic accounting system, and some "habitual" practices were criticized. For example, some people do not turn off the lights when they are not in use, thinking that "leaving the lights on is convenient"; in terms of employment, they always feel that "more people are better" and "the more the better." These comrades do not understand that every kilowatt-hour wasted by the factory and one more person added outside the staffing table will cause an increase in product costs. In the past, copper shavings were all over the floor in the machining workshop. When the experts saw them, they tried to compress the copper shavings into copper cakes for utilization, saving a lot of non-ferrous metals. When a screw is dropped on the ground, the expert must pick it up. These seem to be small things, but some people ignore these small things, which creates a big loophole in wasting funds. Therefore, Soviet comrades often said: "To accumulate funds for the country, we must accumulate from every penny and every screw. Small things put together become an amazing figure." Cost is a mirror of the entire enterprise's work quality. Another method for the factory to systematically reduce costs is: according to planned costs and actual costs, the method of comparing the costs of the previous period and the next period is used to analyze the proportion of product cost consumption every month, every quarter, and every year to see where more money is spent, find out the problems, take measures, and improve them in a timely manner. This method of cost analysis has become an important means to supervise the enterprise to comprehensively complete the production and financial plan.
      Continuously Improve Product Quality
    The fourth major event is to continuously improve product quality. Soviet experts strictly required production to be carried out in accordance with the standards and specifications stipulated by the state, and product quality can only be improved and not reduced. After the factory implemented the economic accounting system, it signed contracts with orderers. If the products delivered by the factory do not meet the provisions of the contract, they must be scrapped and even fined. Soviet experts helped the factory formulate various technical measures and standards to ensure product quality, and established scientific production work. Improving quality is not only a technical issue, but also a political and ideological issue. First of all, we must oppose various conservative ideas. For example, some people have doubts about the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and say: "I have been spinning around wheels for decades, and I can find the problem with my eyes closed"; some people think that they have more than 30 years of experience and can measure the temperature with their eyes. As a result, hundreds of tons of molten steel oxidized due to excessive temperature and were all scrapped. This kind of anti-scientific thinking is no longer popular after the product quality requirements are improved. Everyone realized that production is a science, and they must learn advanced Soviet technology to improve quality, and from then on, they were convinced of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Fighting against defective products and rework products is the most important work to ensure quality improvement. The Soviet experts' experience in fighting against defective products tells us that when carrying out the struggle to improve quality, we must ruthlessly criticize the idea that "there must be some defective products." Some people think that defective products are "inevitable," and one section once formulated a "legal defect rate." Soviet experts said: "We materialists have never admitted that there are any irresistible legal defects. All defective products (here, we are not referring to some inevitable natural consumption) are caused by people, and therefore can be completely eliminated by people." To improve quality, we must strengthen the scientific and technical knowledge of employees, so that they can learn to scientifically control temperature, machines, and tools, and not succumb to difficulties or push the responsibility for producing defective products to objective reasons (such as the raw materials are not good, the weather is not right, etc.). The factory implemented a three-inspection system for products (producers inspect themselves, foreman inspects, and leading worker inspects) in the work of improving quality, determined that the inspection section is responsible to the state and supervises the factory's product quality, strengthened the inspectors' intermediate inspection of various links in production, and at the same time promoted a mass labor competition organizational form for consciously improving quality in the production process - the Ren Dalova work method. This method is to first carry out criticism and self-criticism in one process to ensure that no defective products and rework products are produced, and then strictly check the quality of the unfinished products delivered by the previous process. If the quality is not good, it will be returned to the previous process and suggestions for improvement will be made. As a result of the implementation of the Ren Dalova work method by the Zhu Shiqing team in the mechanical workshop, no defective products have been produced in the past four years. In 1952 alone, more than 100 teams in the factory learned the Ren Dalova work method, which greatly improved product quality.
      Improve Labor Productivity and Correspondingly Improve Worker
          Wage Levels
    The fifth major event is to improve the labor productivity of each worker, and correspondingly improve the wages of workers on the basis of improving labor productivity. Labor productivity, as Lenin said: "In the final analysis, it is the most important and the main condition to ensure the victory of the socialist system." Soviet experts often told Chinese comrades: "People are the decisive force. A dead plan can only be completed by living people." To improve labor productivity, we must "arm labor with technology." The main method is to rely on advanced Soviet experience and various inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of employees to compile and complete technical organizational measures plans. According to this plan, the technical and business levels of workers are frequently and systematically improved, technical operation processes are improved, and advanced labor organization methods are promoted. Comrade Stalin pointed out that all work to improve labor productivity "is based on improving technology and rational organization of labor"
  (Problems of Leninism). How can labor productivity be continuously improved? The factory did three tasks, one is to organize competitions, which is the most basic work. Competition is not a central task for a period of time, but takes the various guarantee conditions put forward to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the production and financial plan as the content, and becomes an effective method of organizing daily production. During the Chinese Changchun Railway period, the factory achieved monthly and quarterly evaluation of production results, ranked the order of superior workshops, promptly commended and rewarded advanced producers, and encouraged everyone to learn from advanced producers. Another measure is that the factory administrative department must re-examine the labor consumption standard of unit products every year, and determine the staffing of production workers and the labor productivity standard (that is, the production volume of each worker) according to the production plan and the labor consumption quota of unit products. Soviet experts always paid attention to guiding enterprise leaders to find and explore various potentials, and systematically and gradually reduced labor consumption standards, such as using mechanized methods to replace heavy labor processes, improving technical operation processes, etc., breaking the supply system thinking of only wanting to reach out to superiors for people, but not exploring labor potential. As a result of the efforts of all employees of the factory in 1952, the labor consumption standard was reduced by 13%, and the man-hour standard was reduced by 14.5%. Finally, to improve labor productivity, we must resolutely fight against violations of labor discipline. The conscious labor of employees is inseparable from strictly abiding by labor discipline. The Soviet chief engineer checked the attendance of employees in each workshop at the production meeting every day. If absenteeism was found, the reasons were immediately investigated, and the administrative and political work departments were required to strengthen education for workers, such as organizing family visits to understand the ideological situation of workers to improve workers' awareness. At the same time, people who seriously violated labor discipline were dealt with in accordance with the regulations, absenteeism must be fined, defective products must be compensated for losses, and employees who are late for work will have their wages deducted. All this is to establish a correct disciplinary point of view and improve people's serious responsibility for national production. Some people's view that absenteeism is a small matter is completely wrong. Experts believe that "absenteeism is actually an act of undermining production," and "if one part is not done, it will disrupt the production order of the entire factory." Only by raising the various phenomena of disrupting discipline to the height of principle and taking effective measures can we improve the workers' conscious enthusiasm for labor. During the Chinese Changchun Railway period, the factory's labor productivity gradually increased. For example, the labor productivity in 1950 was 100, which increased to 128 in 1951 and 138 in 1952. The number of people who could not complete the product standard was greatly reduced. In 1951, there were only 92 people who could not complete the product standard, and in 1952, there were only 81 people. The number of advanced producers greatly increased. In 1951, there were 397 people in the factory, and in 1952, it increased to 1,499 people.
    Appropriately increasing workers' wage income on the basis of improving production is an important means to consolidate and improve labor productivity. The factory continuously revised quotas, and on the basis of advanced quotas, systematically improved workers' wage levels (but the increase in wages must not exceed the rate of increase in labor productivity). In 1951, the man-hour completion rate of the quota was 126%. After the revision of the quota in 1951, the man-hour completion rate was 133%. In July 1952, the quota was revised again. The man-hour completion rate reached 123% within half a year, and the workers' income also increased accordingly. In 1950, the average monthly wage income per piece-rate worker was 180 work points, 242 work points in 1951, and 268 work points in 1952. The factory corrected the unreasonable phenomenon of average distribution of wages that violated the principle of distribution according to work, and determined the principle of combining correct wage payment with improving workers' production enthusiasm. Every piece-rate work ticket must be signed and reviewed item by item by the inspector to ensure that wages are paid correctly on the basis of improving product quality and reducing costs. In the workshop implementing the individual piece-rate wage system, a daily wage calculation system was implemented. The production situation and the wages to be received by each person every day were announced on the workshop's disclosure board to encourage workers to overfulfill the daily production plan. After the wheel workshop implemented the daily wage calculation system, the daily output of the axle head increased from 18 pairs to 24 pairs. In the past, the people who paid wages in the factory never asked about the production situation of the wage earners, and believed that since they were workers or employees in name, they had to be paid wages. People who do not work can also receive money on time. After the Soviet experts came, they changed this supply-based method of receiving allowances, promoted the work of the labor and wage section to face production, and correctly used the wage fund on behalf of the country to ensure that the wages paid can be exchanged for more material wealth than the wages.

    一个值得效法的范例
    ——记哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂在苏联专家直接指导下运用苏联企业管理基本经验的经过
    本报记者  安岗
    位于松花江畔、有着五十多年建厂历史的哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂，是一个规模较大，产品复杂的综合性工厂。一九五○年五月，苏联政府按照中苏友好同盟互助条约以及在条约的基础上签定的关于共同管理中国长春铁路的协定，派来了二十七名专家参加工作。中苏两国同志在友好合作基础上，按照均等用人原则轮流担任正副厂长，正副科长和主要的车间主任。共管时间历两年零八个月，工厂在这个时间内担负的最重要的任务就是全面向苏联学习，运用社会主义先进的企业管理原则和方法，使工厂成为一个先进工厂。
    从一九五○年五月一日起，在苏联专家直接指导下，工厂开始了企业改革工作。改革的目标是按照社会主义企业管理原则在原有的工作基础上（共管前工厂已进行民主改革，工厂管理有了初步的计划生产和成本计算制度）推行经济核算制。苏联专家认为：要使工厂成为一个模范的企业，就必须按照经济核算制的原则来完成和超额完成国家的生产财务计划。正确运用经济核算制这个有计划领导经济的方法，可以排除当时工厂同志思想中根深蒂固的“只问生产，不顾成本，不计积累”的供给制思想，树立起兢兢业业全面管理生产，精打细算，爱惜国家每一文钱的思想，保证按计划交给国家各种产品，同时使工厂全部生产与经济活动的结果，保证交给国家的多于国家拨给企业的款额；实际支出，低于计划支出，保证企业在财政上不发生亏损，给国家积累资金。
    从何入手？
    改革的目标确定了，从何入手呢？
    工厂从推行经济核算制入手，在改变为经济核算制单位的过程中，采取了以下各项措施：一、全盘地改革了组织机构，减缩大批行政管理人员，实行新定员表和各种工作细则、职务手册，把多头领导、无人负责的组织机构变成一个面向生产、单一领导、逐级负责、便于实行经济核算制的机构；二、编制与贯彻执行生产财务计划，内容包括有生产计划、产品成本计划、劳动与工资计划、材料供应计划、技术组织措施计划、财务计划、产品成本计划、基本建设和大修计划。这是工厂实行全面计划管理的基础，也是全体职工共同行动的纲领；三、清查固定资产，确定流动资金定额，工厂在国家拨给的资金范围内实行独立经营；四、实行计件工资制度；五、改革会计计算制度，建立厂内原始统计与证件周转制度；六、中长铁路稽核局在厂内设立稽核室，全面监督工厂日常的生产财务活动；七、召开决算委员会，组织对工厂生产财务活动结果的检查工作。
    经济核算制初步实施的结果，工厂发生了深刻的变化：整个企业活动完全处在计划收支严格监督之下，一切计划任务只准完成不准完不成，一切计划经费只准降低不准超支，企业领导者和全体职工想一切办法全面完成国家计划。因为，只完成生产任务而使流动资金积压，工厂财务工作就会发生困难；只注意压缩流动资金，忽视了生产任务的完成，工厂产品不足，收入减少，不能继续维持生产；生产任务完成，流动资金定额确定得合理，可是，产品质量不好，订货人要求返修或是贬值（头等品变成二等品），结果还是不能及时地把钱换回，影响资金周转，不能继续生产。按照经济核算制原则实行的生产财务计划乃是一个综合性的计划，它要求工厂不仅完成生产计划，而且要同时完成财务计划，不仅要完成生产总值，还必须均衡地完成产品计划，有系统地改善产品质量。只有综合、全面、有机地完成国家计划的一切指标，企业才有可能加速资金的周转，不断地提高生产力，积累资金。工厂在改变为经济核算制单位的具体措施中，明确规定了把工厂集中的计划领导同严格的统计监督相结合的办法。日常的有效的监督是保证企业全面完成国家计划的根本方法。工厂作任何一件事（包括买几个茶杯在内）都必须按计划进行。没有计划和没有经费来源的工作是不能也不允许做的。计划及各种原始凭证是实行监督的依据。监督是多方面的：第一，建立独立的会计制度，采取新的会计科目和资产负债表，编制月、季、年度的决算，全面反映整个企业的经营结果。工厂的总会计在保证监督工厂财务活动上同厂长负有同等的责任；第二，建立稽核制度，驻厂稽核员对工厂每日的现金支用，金库现存，清算往来，工资支付，材料耗用，产品销售以及一切与经济核算有关的活动实行全面监督，一切非计划的开支都不予批准；第三，建立一年一度的财产清查登记制度，查明工厂对国家财产保护情况，同时掌握流动资金定额与实有资金的对比关系，审查工厂生产经济活动的真实结果，同时定期召开全厂和车间决算会议系统地分析和监督企业活动，制定改进工厂生产财务活动的具体措施。
    以综合性的生产财务计划为基础，运用经济核算制这个有计划的领导经济的方法来全面展开工作，使工厂这个大机器灵活地转动起来，这是哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂实行社会主义企业管理的基本特点。
    由此出发，树立了工厂生产的正常秩序。工厂内部实行了计划管理的制度。生产财务计划是职工活动的基础，生产作业计划则是它的继续。作业计划内容包括作好生产准备，编制按月、按旬、按日的作业计划和生产调度工作。这两种计划构成了工厂全部计划管理的体系，工厂通过作业计划克服了过去“碰见什么就干什么”的毛病，每天按照计划进行生产，及时发现和改善生产上和财务上的一切不良现象。计划管理成了动员群众创造新定额，掘发各种潜在的人力、物力，节约人工、材料、燃料等费用，与各种生产损失进行斗争的武器。在苏联专家直接领导下，工厂实现了“一切为了生产”的正确方向：非生产人员减少了，各种繁琐的手续和组织层次简化了，会议除规定的日常会议、调度会议外大大减少了，工人在生产时间内一律不准做非生产工作，临时拉夫、开会的现象没有了，大家不再是“各干各”，而是按照完成和超额完成生产财务计划的目标共同前进。
    但是光有计划和计划管理的制度是不够的。计划和制度只有同职工自觉的劳动相结合才能成为物质的力量。每年在计划确定后，行政同工会共同签定集体合同。群众性的劳动竞赛成为职工保证完成全年生产财务计划和生产作业计划的根本方法。为了超额完成计划，工厂自下而上地发动职工提保证条件，保证条件是群众积极性和创造性的集中表现。在社会主义企业管理原则下，竞赛是全面的、持久的和经常的。它改变了用组织竞赛来临时突击某一项工作的方式，竞赛成为由群众来掌握各种先进工作方法全面实现计划的手段。
    同时动手做的几件工作
    苏联专家领导生产的方法不是一个时期搞一个运动，也不是把生产工作同其他工作（如婚姻法）等量齐观，他们是依靠单一领导逐级负责制，同时动手，全面推进，逐步提高，一切工作都是领导与群众密切结合，计划与监督检查密切结合，都是按照正常的生产秩序来进行。
    中长铁路时期，苏联专家和中国员工在工厂按照以上的目标、措施、制度和方法进行了七项工作，这些工作构成了企业生产的整体，它是在工厂大机器活动中互相联结的部分。苏联专家在实际工作中树立了社会主义的先进的思想、工作方法和制度。
      完成和超额完成生产计划
    工厂做的第一件大事是完成和超额完成国家的生产计划。生产计划的完成是工厂活动最重要的指标。苏联专家带领全体职工坚决依照国家的需要来进行生产，无条件地、坚决地完成国家规定的一切产品种类和数量。过去有人喜欢挑好干的干，不好干的就少干，甚至不干。这种做法是绝对不允许了。国家交给工厂的临时生产任务，工厂虽有困难也要接受下来保证完成，同时还要坚决完成正常的生产计划。苏联同志在工作中从来不强调客观困难，而是从内部多方面地发掘潜力，保证完成计划。中长铁路时期工厂产量逐年上升，以一九五○年月平均计划数字为一○○，一九五一年为一二八点六，一九五二年为一九一点五；生产计划实际完成情况：一九五○年为一二二，一九五一年为一二四点三，一九五二年为一九九点六。工厂完成生产计划的主要方法是实行每日生产动态分析表，按照作业计划安排进度，保证均衡生产。如机械车间没有按生产进度表进行加工，结果一个车间就积压了全厂在制品流动资金的三分之二。苏联专家组织全体职工严格遵守产品生产周期进度表，实行缩短生产周期提高质量的先进工作方法，在三个月内就把在制品流动资金压缩到正常定额。这种均衡生产的方法是全面的而不是孤立的。它不但巩固了正常的生产秩序，而且成为提高产品质量缩短生产周期加速资金周转的重要手段。
      完成和超额完成财务计划
    第二件大事，是在与完成生产计划的同时，完成和超额完成财务计划。工厂成为经济核算制单位后，国家拨给工厂一定数量的固定资产和流动资金，由工厂独立经营。工厂一切生产经济活动完全处在严格的资金监督之下。苏联专家帮助中国同志学习自觉地利用价值法则对生产的影响。正如斯大林同志所说：“在我们的企业中，这样一些问题，如经济核算和赢利问题、成本问题、价格问题等等，就具有现实的意义。所以，我们的企业是不能不而且不应该不考虑到价值法则的。”（苏联社会主义经济问题）工厂做任何一件事都要精打细算，尽一切可能减少支出，那怕是一文钱也要节省。赔了钱就不能算做全面完成国家计划。为了完成财务计划，首先纠正“生产计划必须完成，财务计划可以放松”“完成任务不算账”的有害思想，当时工厂积压了大批材料，如材料部门为了图省事一次竟买了五吨硫酸，足够八年使用，类似的现象很多。领导上一面向职工进行爱惜国家财产实行经济核算制的思想教育，一面以苏联厂长赫里杰维赤为首组织内部资金动员委员会清查登记商品、材料、在制品和黑材料，压缩一切超定额的材料和零件，使工厂流动资金由一九五○年五月一日实际结余的七百六十五亿元，到一九五二年压缩为二百六十五亿元，解放出大批资金进行扩大生产。同时树立了严格的财政纪律、计划纪律及资产负债对照表的决算分析制度，建立了按时同订货人结算的制度，改变过去把货交出去忘了要钱的现象。此外，稽核制度在保证监督工厂实行经济核算制不浪费一文钱等方面也起了极重要的作用。由于采取以上的一系列措施，工厂的财政状况逐年好转。工厂在两年零八个月期间，没有发生财政上的困难，也没有向银行借过一文钱，他们用动员内部扩大生产的办法积累了资金。一九五○年工厂获得的企业积累占全年生产总值百分之二十一点七，一九五一年占百分之二十九，一九五二年占百分之三十五点四。超额地完成了国家规定的生产总值和商品总值。
      有系统地降低成本
    第三件大事是有系统地降低产品成本，精确地分析计算构成每一产品成本的因素，用一切办法节省人工、材料、燃料、电力等费用。工厂确立一条原则：用最小的但也是最合理的人工和材料来出产最多和最好的成品；成本只许降低不许超支，成本超支了就无法支付工薪和购买原料、燃料，使一切计划都有落空的危险。降低成本，又是积累资金的主要源泉，如材料费占了全部成本费用的百分之七十，工厂就采用多种方法节约材料，实行旧零件加工再用的方法；利用废料；用钢铁铸件代替铜铸件；开展群众性的利用废料运动，结果产品成本逐年降低。人们开始树立起降低成本实行经济核算制的思想，某些“习惯成自然”的作风受到了批判。如有人不用电灯时也不关电门，认为“开着灯方便”；在用人上总觉得“人多好办事”、“多多益善”，这些同志不了解：工厂浪费的每一度电和在定员外多增加一个人都会造成产品成本的增加。过去，加工车间满地是铜屑，专家见了就想办法把铜屑压成铜饼来利用，节省了大量的有色金属。一个螺丝丢在地上时，专家一定要把它拣起来。这些看起来都是小事，有些人正是忽视了这些小事，就造成了浪费资金的大漏洞。所以，苏联同志常说：“为国家积累资金就要在一文钱、一个螺丝钉上去积累，小事情弄到一起就成了惊人的数字。”成本是整个企业工作质量的一面镜子。工厂有系统地降低成本的另一个方法是：根据计划成本与实际成本，用上一时期与下一时期成本对比的方法来分析每月、每季、每年的产品成本消耗比重，看一看在哪些方面花多了，找出毛病，采取措施，及时改进。这种成本分析的方法成了监督企业全面完成生产财务计划的重要手段。
      不断地提高产品质量
    第四件大事是不断地提高产品质量。苏联专家严格要求按照国家规定的标准和规格进行生产，产品质量只能提高不得降低。工厂实行经济核算制后，同订货人签定合同，如工厂交出的产品不符合合同上的规定就得作废以至罚款。苏联专家帮助工厂制订保证产品质量的各种技术措施和标准，建立了生产科学化的工作。提高质量不仅是技术问题，而且是政治思想问题，首先必须反对各种保守思想，如有人对苏联先进经验抱怀疑态度说：“车轮这种东西，我围着它转了几十年，闭着眼睛就能找出毛病”；有人认为自己有三十多年经验，用眼睛就可以测定温度，结果百吨钢水因温度过高起了氧化作用，全部作废。这一类的反科学思想，在产品质量要求提高后就吃不开了。大家认识到生产是一种科学，必须学习苏联的先进技术才能提高质量，从此对苏联先进经验心服口服。向废品和返修品进行斗争是保证提高质量最重要的工作。苏联专家向废品作斗争的经验告诉我们：在进行提高质量的斗争的时候，必须无情地批判那种认为“多少总得有废品”的思想，有些人认为废品是“非有不可”的，有一个科曾拟定一个“法定废品率”。苏联专家说：“我们唯物论者，从来就不承认有什么不可抗拒的法定废品，一切废品（这里指的不是某种不可避免的自然消耗）都是人造成的，因而都是完全能够被人消灭的。”提高质量就要加强职工科学技术知识，使他们学会科学地控制温度、机器、工具，而不要向困难屈服或是把出废品的责任推给客观（如借口原料不好，天气不对等）。工厂在提高质量的工作中推行了产品的三检制（生产者自己检查、工长检查、领工员检查），确定检查科对国家负责，监督工厂产品质量，加强了检查员对生产各个环节的中间检查，同时在生产工序中推行群众自觉提高质量的劳动竞赛组织形式——任大洛瓦工作方法，这种方法是由一道工序首先开展批评与自我批评，保证自己不出废品和返修品，然后，严格检查上道工序交来的未完成品的质量，如果质量不好就退给上道工序，提出改进的意见。机械车间朱世清小组实行任大洛瓦工作方法的结果，四年来没有出过一件废品。一九五二年一年，工厂共有一百多个小组学习了任大洛瓦工作法，大大提高了产品质量。
      提高劳动生产率并相应地提高工人
          工资水平
    第五件大事是提高每一个工人的劳动生产率，并在提高劳动生产率的基础上，相应地提高工人工资待遇。劳动生产率，正如列宁所说的：“归根结底是保证社会主义制度胜利的最重要和最主要的条件。”苏联专家经常告诉中国同志：“人是决定性的力量，死的计划只有靠活的人才能完成”，提高劳动生产率，就得“用技术来武装劳动”，主要的方法是依靠苏联先进经验和职工的各种发明创造、合理化建议来编制和完成技术组织措施计划，按照这个计划，经常地有计划地提高工人技术业务水平，改进技术作业过程和推行先进的劳动组织方法。斯大林同志曾指出提高劳动生产率的一切工作，“都是以改善技术和合理的组织劳动为基础”
  （列宁主义问题）。怎样能使劳动生产率不断提高呢？工厂作了三项工作，一个是组织竞赛，这是最基本的工作。竞赛不是一个时期一个中心，而是以保证全面完成和超额完成生产财务计划而提出的各种保证条件为内容，成为有效的组织日常生产的方法。工厂在中长铁路时期做到了按月按季评定生产成绩，排列优胜车间的位置顺序，及时表扬和奖励先进生产者，鼓励人人向先进生产者看齐。另一个措施是工厂行政部门每年都要重新审查单位产品的人工消耗标准，根据生产计划及单位产品的人工消耗定额来确定生产工人的定员和劳动生产率的标准（即每个工人的生产量）。苏联专家随时注意引导企业领导者去寻找和发掘各种潜力，有计划地逐步降低劳动力消耗标准，如采用机械化方法代替繁重的劳动过程，改进技术作业过程等，打破了那种只想伸手向上级要人，而不去发掘劳动潜力的供给制思想。一九五二年工厂全体职工努力的结果，劳动力消耗标准降低了百分之十三，工时标准降低了百分之十四点五。最后，提高劳动生产率，必须坚决向违犯劳动纪律现象进行斗争。职工自觉的劳动同严格遵守劳动纪律是分不开的。苏联总工程师每天在生产会议上检查各车间职工出勤情况，发现欠勤，立即追究原因，要求行政和政治工作部门加强对工人的教育，如组织家庭访问，了解工人思想情况来提高工人觉悟，同时对严重破坏劳动纪律的人都是照章给以处理，旷工一定罚款，无故出废品一定要赔偿损失，职员迟上班就要扣工资，这一切都是为了树立正确的纪律观点，提高人们对国家生产的严肃负责精神。某些人把旷工欠勤看做小事的看法，是完全错误的。专家认为：“旷工实际上是一种瓦解生产的行为”，“一件零件没有人干，就会打乱全厂生产秩序”，只有提到原则高度去认识各种破坏纪律的现象，并作有效处理，才能提高工人自觉的劳动热情。中长铁路时期，工厂劳动生产率是逐步提高的，如一九五○年劳动生产率为一百，一九五一年提高到一百二十八，一九五二年提高到一百三十八。不能完成产品标准的人数大大减少，一九五一年不能完成产品标准的只有九十二人，一九五二年只有八十一人，先进生产者的数量大大增加，一九五一年全厂有三百九十七人，到一九五二年就增加到一千四百九十九人。
    在提高生产的基础上适当地提高工人工资收入，是巩固和提高劳动生产率的重要手段。工厂不断修正定额，在定额的先进基础上，有计划地提高了工人工资水平（但工资的提高不得超过劳动生产率增长的比率）。一九五一年定额的工时完成率为百分之一百二十六，一九五一年定额修订后的工时完成率是百分之一百三十三，到一九五二年七月又重新修订定额，半年期间工时完成率即达到百分之一百二十三，工人收入也随着提高，一九五○年计件工人每人每月平均工资收入是一百八十工分，一九五一年为二百四十二工分，一九五二年为二百六十八工分。工厂纠正了违反按劳取酬的原则，平均分配工资的不合理现象，确定了正确支付工资与提高工人生产积极性相结合的原则，每一个计件工作票都要经检查员逐项签字审查，保证在提高产品质量与降低成本的基础上正确地支付工资。在实行个人计件工资制的车间，实行了按日计算工资制度，每人每天完成生产情况和应领的工资都在车间的揭示牌上公布出来，鼓励工人超额完成每日的生产计划。车轮车间实行日工资计算制度后，旋轴头的日产量由十八对提高到二十四对。过去工厂支付工资的人向来不过问领工资人的生产情形，认为既然在名义上是工人或是职员就得照发工资。不做工作的人同样可以按时领钱。苏联专家来后改变了这种供给制的领津贴办法，推动劳动工资科的工作面向生产，代表国家正确运用工资基金，保证使支付出去的工资都能给国家换回价值较工资为多的物质财富。
