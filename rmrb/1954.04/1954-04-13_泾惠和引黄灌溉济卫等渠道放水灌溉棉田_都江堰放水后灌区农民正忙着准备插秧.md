Jinghui, Luohui, and Weihui, three state-owned channels in Shaanxi Province, and the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Channel in Henan Province, have successively opened their gates to release water, helping farmers in the irrigation areas with spring irrigation of cotton fields. Since the water release on March 30th, the water diversion volume of various channels in Shaanxi has been continuously increasing. By the 5th, the Jinghui Canal had irrigated 250,000 mu of cotton fields. The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Canal released water on April 1st and is expected to irrigate 230,000 mu of cotton fields and early autumn land within ten days.

Before releasing water, all channels carried out work such as tidying up the channels, training water management personnel, and formulating irrigation plans. This time, the Luohui Canal newly opened and repaired more than 177,000 meters of channels and repaired more than 310 structures. In late March, the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Administration held a meeting of section chiefs and technicians to formulate irrigation plans for cotton, early autumn crop sowing, and wheat jointing, stipulating that the irrigation task this time is more than 576,000 mu. Before April 10th, the focus is on irrigating blank land, and from April 10th to 25th, the focus is on irrigating wheat jointing water.

Dujiangyan in Sichuan also released water ahead of schedule on April 1st, and the rolling river water is flowing to 3 million mu of farmland in 15 cities and counties of the Chengdu Plain. Farmers in the irrigation area are grinding rice paddies, preparing to transplant rice seedlings early. After several years of continuous renovation, the Dujiangyan project has played a significant role in increasing grain production in the irrigation area. Last year, the entire basin increased production by 7 percent on the basis of the 1952 bumper harvest, an increase of 20 percent compared to the year before liberation. More than 20 days of renovation work were carried out in March this year, so that farmers in the upper and lower reaches have sufficient water, striving to increase production by 6 percent compared to last year.

    泾惠和引黄灌溉济卫等渠道放水灌溉棉田
    都江堰放水后灌区农民正忙着准备插秧
    陕西省的泾惠、洛惠、渭惠三条国营渠道和河南省的引黄灌溉济卫渠道都先后开闸放水，帮助灌区农民棉田春灌。陕西各渠道自三月三十日放水以来，引水量不断增加，泾惠渠到五日止，已灌完棉田二十五万亩。引黄灌溉渠在四月一日放水，预计在十天内灌完棉田和早秋地二十三万亩。
    各渠道在放水以前，都进行整理渠道、训练行水人员、制订灌溉计划等工作。洛惠渠这次就新开和补修渠道十七万七千多公尺，修建筑物三百一十多处。引黄灌溉济卫管理局在三月下旬召开段长、技术人员会议，制订了棉花、早秋作物下种和小麦拔节灌溉计划，规定这次灌溉任务为五十七万六千多亩，四月十日以前以浇灌白地为主，四月十日到二十五日以浇小麦拔节水为主。
    四川都江堰也提前于四月一日放水，滚滚的河水正流向成都平原十五市、县的三百万亩农田。灌区农民正在打磨秧田，准备提早插秧。都江堰工程经过几年来不断的修整，对灌区粮食增产起了显著作用，去年全流域在一九五二年丰收的基础上又增产百分之七，比解放前一年增产二成。今年三月又进行了二十多天的整修工作，使上下游农田都有了充足的用水，争取今年比去年再增产百分之六。
