    Factory Production Plans Must Be Advanced
    By Our Reporter An Gang
    Everyone verbally agrees that factory production plans should be advanced plans. But what exactly constitutes an advanced plan?
    This year, the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory set its first-quarter production value plan at only 92.5% of the actual production value of the first quarter of last year. Why is this year's plan lower than last year's? Besides the fact that the factory outsourced more work in 1953, there are supposedly two reasons: one is that the Ministry of Railways assigned fewer tasks, and the other is that the technical requirements are stricter and the quality requirements are higher. After the plan was made, the factory leaders consulted with Soviet experts. After reviewing it, the experts said: "This year's plan is so much lower than last year's. How can this be called advanced? In the Soviet Union, if the plan is set too low, the factory director would not agree. Even if the factory director agreed, when it is sent to the Party committee, the Party secretary would immediately take out the first-quarter plan from last year and compare it, saying: 'No, this year's plan must be higher than last year's.'"
    To formulate advanced plans, it is necessary to overcome various difficulties and fight against various undesirable phenomena that hinder the implementation of the plan.
    If it is because "the higher authorities assigned fewer tasks," then we must actively ask the higher authorities for more work. Administratively, we must approach the section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and even the minister, explaining the factory's production capacity and urging the higher authorities to strive for production tasks from other areas of the country, so that the factory's personnel and equipment do not become idle.
    If it is because of "many internal difficulties," these difficulties can be completely overcome by mobilizing the masses, and we must move forward in the struggle to continuously overcome difficulties. It is for this reason that the Soviets call their plans "mobilization plans." Comrades who deliberately set the plan low will inevitably end up like a Soviet expert described: holding the banner of advancement in their left hand and the conservative plan in their right hand, they will slowly put down their left hand and completely succumb to the difficulties. Why? Some enterprise leaders often have the idea that "it is a fact that this year's task is lower than last year's, but wouldn't it be better if we overfulfilled it by a large margin?" They should be told that if last year was 100%, then even 0.1% more than last year is good; conversely, if this year's plan is reduced to 70% of last year's, even if it is overfulfilled by 5%, this plan is not advanced. The Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory's locomotive workshop stipulated that the production task for January was to overhaul nine locomotives (the average monthly overhaul in the fourth quarter of 1953 was more than ten locomotives). Ordinarily, this number should have been achievable, but on the contrary, only eight locomotives were overhauled. Why? Because the plan was set too low, losing its role in mobilizing the masses, and competition could not be launched. The leadership, believing that fourteen locomotives were completed last month, assumed that nine locomotives in January would not be a problem. As a result, problems that should have been solved, such as cylinder cracks, were not addressed promptly, and potential difficulties were not anticipated. As a result, at the end of January, it was discovered that the quality of one overhauled locomotive did not meet the standards and could not be delivered, but it was too late to remedy it. In February (although this month had seven fewer working days than January), the comrades in the locomotive workshop learned their lesson and organized balanced production. Because they quickly corrected their shortcomings, they overfulfilled the task in all aspects in February. In March, the workshop completed the overhaul of thirteen locomotives. According to the branch secretary of the workshop, the workshop still has great potential. What does this fact illustrate? The production capacity of this workshop is sufficient to overhaul ten locomotives, and overhauling eleven would be somewhat difficult but not impossible. However, the leadership only assigned nine, which fostered a slack mood among the workshop's production leaders. The correct approach should be to assign the workshop more tasks, even if it is tight. After receiving the tasks, the workshop leaders would conscientiously rely on the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League to launch competitions to ensure the completion of the tasks. This fact fully illustrates that only advanced plans can promote the progress of production.
    How should advanced plans be formulated and implemented? During the period of the China Changchun Railway (referring to the period of joint Sino-Soviet administration of the China Changchun Railway, same below), the guiding principles for the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory in formulating and implementing plans were legality, scientificity, advancement, and feasibility.
    "The state plan is the law." An advanced plan must unconditionally reflect all the production tasks and various indicators assigned by the higher authorities. Soviet experts said: "The annual plan is the program, it is the law. All its products and various technical and economic indicators must be fulfilled." Taking the completion of the annual plan by state-owned factories in Harbin in 1953 as an example, most factories overfulfilled the production plan, but this plan was actually only a plan for the total value of production. The vast majority of factories did not fully complete the plan, with product quality, variety, cost reduction, and attendance rates being the worst. Some economic workers believe that "any method is acceptable as long as the task is completed." Under the control of this thought, acts violating national requirements have occurred; some people believe that "since the total value of production is expressed in currency, I only need to complete the monetary amount," so they do not produce according to the varieties stipulated by the state; others adopt a "pick and choose" attitude when receiving state tasks, only paying attention to completing the quantity of products and unwilling to produce complex, laborious, or even loss-making products. How did the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory implement the 1950 production and financial plan during the China Changchun Railway period? In order to make the plan a law that everyone abides by, they made production and financial plans for each workshop based on the overall plan, including task plans, cost plans, staffing, wage fund budgets, and indirect expense budgets. The production and financial plans were distributed to the workshops, but initially, they did not receive the attention they deserved. The workshop directors believed that knowing the quantity of production tasks was enough, and they did not seriously study various quota indicators, feeling that the plan contained too much information and was troublesome. Some locked the plan in drawers as confidential documents, and others handed the plan over to the economic planners without even looking at it. After these situations were discovered, the factory department conducted education on the importance of the plan and took many specific measures: 1. Conducted general lectures for cadres on the content and significance of economic and technical plans and conducted examinations; 2. Trained workshop economic planners, enabling them to learn how to analyze production and financial activities by comparing actual results with the plan, promptly raise issues to workshop cadres, and help workshop cadres regularly conduct economic analysis of production; 3. Determined that the results of the workshop's implementation of the production and financial plan would be used as the basis for evaluating the workshop's monthly work performance. Workshops with excellent results were ranked at the forefront of each workshop and provided material rewards to workshop cadres and workers, greatly increasing the awareness of all employees of the production and financial plan; 4. The factory director presided over the workshop final settlement committee, and the workshop director reported the workshop's implementation of the production and financial plan using economic activity analysis methods, and a resolution on improving work was made at the meeting. Therefore, before the meeting, the leadership had to first check and understand the situation of each workshop's plan implementation; 5. Adhere to the overall interests of the country in the formulation and implementation of the plan and oppose localism. The factory has promptly corrected various errors such as falsely reporting achievements, defrauding bonuses, pursuing illegal profits, and not completing state tasks to do unplanned work. These measures promoted workshop cadres' attention to and research on the production and financial plan. After the monthly plan was issued, they automatically organized team leaders to discuss the plan and quickly implemented the plan in the teams. Because the workers understood the technical and economic indicators of their workshop, they could also improve their enthusiasm and produce according to state indicators.
    Advanced plans should reflect new achievements in science and technology, so they must be formulated and implemented with a scientific perspective. In 1950, the axles of the locomotives repaired by the factory often overheated, causing many major rework incidents, and one locomotive was test-run as many as twenty-six times. However, the factory did not formulate the plan based on such backward technical conditions. Instead, they proposed improvement measures in the plan according to scientific requirements, determined new operating procedures, improved axle tile quality, and improved lubricating oil, finally eliminating all axle overheating phenomena. The number of test runs for major repairs of locomotives was reduced from twenty-six times to one or two times, and the plan was based on one test run instead of twenty-six times. Soviet experts helped the factory implement new technical operating procedures, which is the scientific basis of the plan. The transformation of technical operating procedures is a systematic technical revolution. This method should start from weak and key production links, systematically and comprehensively adopt advanced Soviet experience and rationalization proposals of advanced producers; use technical innovation spirit to specifically study the organization of each process and each production action, retain the scientific parts, remove the backward parts, and formulate and implement new operating procedure schedules. For example, after the new operating procedure was implemented, the wood drying time was shortened from about twenty days to about ten days. In addition, advanced methods such as high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-edge cutting, and assembly line operations were successfully implemented, shortening the production cycle. When formulating the plan, all conservative ideas should be opposed. For example, workers in some factories have created various tools that can improve production, but these tools are only used on the lathes of the workers who created the new tools, and other similar lathes in the factory have not adopted them; this phenomenon of "advanced is advanced, backward is backward," and "advanced experience does not go out" is very common in various factories. Therefore, when formulating the plan, it should be based on the effect produced by applying new tools and new work methods to similar lathes; some factories clearly have mechanized tools (such as cranes) that can replace manual loading and unloading, but some enterprise workers are afraid that "cranes are not safe," so they still retain a lot of labor in the plan to replace cranes for loading and unloading, and the cranes are instead listed as spare parts. Such a plan, without accurately analyzing and utilizing all the technical conditions of the factory, will inevitably increase production costs and cannot be allowed. An important means for the factory to ensure the completion of the plan is to formulate a technical and organizational measures plan at the same time as formulating the factory's production and financial plan. The technical and organizational measures plan includes the implementation of assembly line operations, multi-machine tending methods, new technical operating procedures, workers' rationalization proposals, inventions, and various measures to improve equipment utilization. With a technical and organizational measures plan, the completion of the production and financial plan has a scientific and technical guarantee.
    The decisive factor in achieving advanced plans should be people's conscious labor. Our plan should not be based on average quotas but should be based on average advanced quotas. The plan should be formulated according to the direction of raising backward production quotas to advanced quotas. For example, there are three groups manufacturing the same type of product, and these three groups are working under the same conditions. According to the calculation of past time, in terms of labor productivity and product manufacturing quantity, the first group completes 90% of the plan, the second group is 100%, and the third group is 110%. Then the average productivity is 100%. If the plan is formulated according to the average quota, according to this example, the output and labor productivity of the three groups should be 100%, which is equal to the past quota. In this way, the group with a productivity of 110% will receive a new plan that is 10% lower than the labor productivity already achieved, and they will feel that they can complete it without strenuous labor. The second group can also complete the plan effortlessly. This method is to let the backward drag down the advanced, which is wrong. Some people are afraid of revising quotas, thinking that "revising quotas will cause trouble," which is wrong. The plan must "be determined by advanced workers, engineers, and technicians, because they show the possibility of achieving highly advanced technical quotas and ensuring the overfulfillment of the national plan" (Resolution of the Soviet Council of Ministers on national economic issues in 1947). The advancement of the plan depends on the advancement of the quota. During the China Changchun Railway period, under the direct leadership of Soviet experts, the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory began to formulate empirical statistical quotas for each unit of product according to consumption items from 1950 and gradually improved on this basis. The 1951 quota was no longer the average but a quota slightly higher than the average. The average standard of manual consumption was reduced by 5% to 20%, and the material consumption was reduced by 35% to 60% compared with the regulations of the Ministry of Railways. By 1952, the working hours consumption and material consumption quotas of various major products in various indicators had been changed from empirical statistical quotas to technical review quotas. For example, using ferrous metals instead of non-ferrous metals saved 10.3 billion yuan in material costs, which played a great role in reducing quotas. During the China Changchun Railway period, the factory resolutely opposed the kind of statistical quota that did not analyze various artificial shortcomings in the work and made a general overview of various losses. This quota could only strangle the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and lead the enterprise leaders to deviate from the masses and become bureaucratic. In daily work, the factory formulates quotas based on the actual statistical data of each product expenditure item, analyzing and studying the advanced factors that give full play to the factory's highest production capacity. They implemented a correct principle: the various quotas of each year must be lower than the actual average quota achieved. This can organize the continuous upsurge of mass production enthusiasm.
    Advanced plans should reflect the realistic achievements of the working class in production. It is formulated and implemented based on the principle of continuous rise in production and attracting the conscious participation of the masses. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "... It would be foolish to think that a production plan is just a table of numbers and a list of work tasks. In fact, the production plan is the living practical action of hundreds of millions of people. The reality of our production plan is the hundreds of millions of laborers who are creating a new life. The reality of our production plan is the living people, it is ourselves, our will to work, our determination to work according to new work methods, and our determination to implement the plan..." (Problems of Leninism). One of the basic characteristics of the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory's plan is that it is closely integrated with the daily labor of the masses and with the mass labor form - competition. The factory's production and financial plan is based on the workshop's production and financial plan. The workshop's plan is formulated based on the production achievements obtained by the creative labor of the workers. From May 1, 1950, the date of joint Sino-Soviet administration, the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory issued the production and financial plan approved by the higher authorities to each executor, organized all employees to discuss and study the main indicators in the plan. The result of the discussion unified the thoughts and actions of all employees of the factory, and then the employees consciously put forward specific conditions to ensure the completion of the planned tasks and technical and economic indicators. These guarantee conditions are higher than the original planned tasks. It is based on completing all indicators of the factory, mastering advanced work methods, and improving the political awareness and technical level of all employees. After the guarantee conditions were determined, everyone launched a labor competition based on the guarantee conditions. In the competition, advanced people who broke the old quotas were promptly commended and rewarded. The factory clearly stipulated that the standard of advancement is to break the old quotas and establish new quotas rather than other things. In the competition, groups striving for superior quality products, advanced model workshops, etc. appeared, and a large number of advanced producers and labor models emerged. The result of the employee labor competition in 1950 was the completion of 122% of the original plan. This number became the basis for the original compilation of the 1951 plan, reflecting the principle of continuous rise in production and continuous reduction in costs. When compiling the plan, some people also made excuses such as "old machines" and "small production area," believing that "production has reached the top" and "cannot be more advanced." This backward thinking was strictly criticized. The factory formulates the plan according to the production growth rate. If the productivity and production volume increased by 10% in the first year, the factory should use the production growth rate of 10% in the first year to formulate the plan in the second year without adding new equipment. The plan reflects the reality of production development rather than succumbing to objective difficulties.
    Now, some factories clearly have backward plans (which can be seen by comparing them with last year's plans) but think that "they cannot be more advanced." Then please check whether these basic conditions that are indispensable for socialist enterprise plans are available in the plan. This is also a method of using the spirit of the general line to check the work.

    工厂制订的生产计划必须是先进的
    本报记者　安岗
    工厂的生产计划应当是先进的计划，这在口头上是谁也不否认的。但是，什么是先进的计划呢？
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂今年订出第一季度生产总值计划只相当于去年第一季度的百分之九十二点五，为什么今年比去年低了呢？除了一九五三年工厂外委工作较多外，据说原因有两个，一个是铁道部给的任务少了，另一个是技术要求严格，质量要求高了。计划作出后，工厂负责同志找苏联专家请教，专家看了说：“今年比去年低了这么多，这怎能叫先进呢？在苏联，如果计划订低了，厂长不会同意，即使厂长同意了，送给党委会，党委书记马上会把去年第一季度计划拿出来比较一下说：‘不行，今年的计划一定要得比去年高。’”
    制订先进的计划，必须克服各种困难并向阻碍实现计划的各种不良现象进行斗争。
    如果是“上级给的任务少”，那就要积极找上级多要求工作。行政上要找处长、局长以至于部长，向上级说明工厂的生产能力，推动上级去争取国家其他方面的生产任务，使工厂的人和设备不致空闲起来。
    如果是“内部困难多”，困难是完全可以动员群众来克服的，我们就要在不断克服困难的斗争中前进；正因如此，苏联才把计划叫做“动员计划”。故意把计划订低的同志，他的结局就一定会像一位苏联专家所描述的那样：他左手拿着先进的旗帜，右手拿着保守的计划，他慢慢地就会把左手放下来，完全向困难屈服了。为什么呢？有些企业领导者常常有这样一种想法：“今年的任务比去年订得低是事实，可是我们让它多超额完成，岂不更好？”应该告诉他们：如果去年是百分之百，今年比去年多了百分之零点一也是好的；相反的，把今年计划降低到去年的百分之七十，即使超额完成了百分之五，这个计划也不是先进的。今年哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂机车车间一月份的生产任务规定了检修九台机车（一九五三年第四季度平均每月检修十台多），按常情说，这个数字应该能完成了吧，但恰恰相反，仍然只检修了八台。为什么呢？因为计划订低了，失去了动员群众的作用，竞赛也搞不起来，而领导上认为上月十四台都完成了，一月份九台不会有问题，于是，应该解决的问题如汽缸裂纹问题没有抓紧解决，可能发生的困难也没有预见到，结果到一月底才发现检修过的机车有一台质量不合标准，交不出去，但已无法补救。二月份（虽然这个月份工作日比一月份少七天），机车车间的同志接受了教训，组织了均衡生产。由于他们很快地改正了自己的缺点，二月份就超额全面完成了任务，到了三月份，该车间完成了检修十三台机车，据该车间支部书记谈，车间还有着很大的潜力。这个事实说明了什么问题呢？这个车间的生产能力是可以检修十台机车的，至于要检修十一台就有些困难，但是并非不可能完成。可是，领导上只分配了九台，这就助长了车间生产领导者的松懈情绪。正确的作法应该分配给车间较多的任务，虽则紧一些，但车间领导者接到任务以后就会兢兢业业依靠党、工会和青年团发动竞赛来保证完成任务。这一事实充分说明了只有先进的计划才能够推动生产的前进。
    怎样编制和执行先进的计划呢？中长铁路时期（即指中长铁路中苏共管时期，下同）哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂编制和执行计划的指导原则是法律性，科学性，先进性和现实性。
    “国家计划就是法律”。先进的计划必须无条件体现上级分配的全部生产任务和各种指标，苏联专家说：“年度计划就是纲领，就是法律，它的各种产品，各种技术经济指标都必须完成。”以一九五三年哈尔滨市国营工厂完成全年计划的情形来看，多数的工厂超额完成了生产计划，但这个计划实际只是生产总值的计划。绝大多数工厂都没有全面地完成计划，其中以产品质量、品种、降低成本、出勤率等方面完成得最不好。有些经济工作人员认为“不管用什么方法，完成任务就行”，在这种思想支配下，发生了违反国家要求的行为；有人认为“既然生产总值是用货币来表现的，我只要完成钱数就够了”，于是，他们就不按国家规定的品种进行生产；还有的人接到国家的任务时采取“挑好的干”的态度，只注意完成产品数量，不愿生产复杂费力甚至赔钱的产品。中长铁路时期，哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂是怎样执行一九五○年度的生产财务计划的呢？他们为使计划成为人人遵守的法律，根据计划，制成发给车间的生产财务计划书，其中包括任务计划、成本计划、定员、工资基金预算、间接费预算等。生产财务计划书发到车间，起初并没有引起应有的重视，车间主任认为，知道生产任务数量就够了，他们没有认真研究各种定额指标，感到计划内容多了麻烦。有的就把计划锁到抽屉里当作保密文件，有的连看也不看就把计划交给经济计划员去办。发现了这些情况后，厂部就进行了重视计划的教育和采取了许多具体措施：一、普遍给干部讲经济技术计划的内容和意义，并进行考试；二、培养车间经济计划员，使他们学会用实际结果和计划对比的方法分析生产财务活动，及时向车间干部提出问题，帮助车间干部经常作生产的经济分析工作；三、确定以车间执行生产财务计划书的结果作为评比车间每月工作成绩的依据，成绩优良的车间排在各车间的前列，并给车间干部、工人物质奖励，大大地提高了全体职工对生产财务计划书的认识；四、由厂长主持召开车间决算委员会，由车间主任用经济活动分析的方法报告车间执行生产财务计划的情形，会上要作出关于改进工作的决议。所以会前，领导上要先经过检查了解那个车间执行计划的情况；五、在制订计划及执行计划中要坚持国家的整体利益，反对本位主义。工厂曾经及时纠正了各种谎报成绩，骗取奖金，追求非法利润，不完成国家任务而去作计划外的工作等错误。这些措施推动了车间干部重视和研究生产财务计划，以后每月计划发下来，就自动组织领工员讨论计划，很快把计划贯彻到小组里去，由于工人了解了本车间的技术经济指标，因而也就能提高积极性，按照国家指标进行生产。
    先进的计划要反映科学与技术方面新的成就，因此，必须用科学的观点来编制和执行计划。一九五○年工厂修的机车大轴常常发热，造成多次重大返工，一台机车曾经试运达二十六次。但是工厂并没有根据这样落后的技术条件去制订计划，他们却在计划中按照科学的要求提出改进措施，确定新的作业过程，改进轴瓦质量，改善滑润油，终于全部消灭了大轴发热现象，大修机车试运次数由二十六次降到一两次，计划中就以试运一次为根据而不以二十六次为根据。苏联专家帮助工厂实行新的技术作业过程，这是计划的科学基础。改造技术作业过程是有系统的技术上的革命，这种方法要从薄弱和关键的生产环节入手，有系统地综合采用苏联先进经验，和先进生产者的合理化建议；用技术革新精神具体研究每一道工序的组织、每一个生产动作，保留其中科学部分，去掉落后的部分，制定和推行新的作业过程进度表。如实行了新作业过程后，木材干燥时间，就由二十天缩短到十天左右。此外还顺利地推行了高速切削、多刀多刃和流水作业等先进方法，缩短生产周期。制订计划的时候就要反对一切保守思想，譬如有的工厂工人创造了各种能提高生产的工具，但是这种工具只在创造新工具工人自己的车床上使用，工厂其他同样的车床却没有采用；这种“先进自先进，落后自落后”，“先进经验不出门”的现象在各工厂是很普遍的。所以订计划时就应当按照新工具和新工作法应用到同类车床上去所产生的效果来编制；有的工厂明明有机械化的工具
  （如起重机）可以代替人工装卸物品，但有些企业工作者却害怕“起重机不保险”，于是在计划内仍保留很多劳动力代替起重机装卸，把起重机反而列为备用品。这样的计划，没有精确地分析利用工厂一切技术条件，必然增加生产开支，是不能允许的。工厂保证完成计划的重要手段就是在编制工厂生产财务计划的同时就编制技术组织措施计划。技术组织措施计划包括了推行流水作业法，多机床看管法，新的技术作业过程，工人的合理化建议发明创造以及提高设备运用的各种措施，有了技术组织措施计划，生产财务计划的完成就有了科学的技术保证。
    实现先进计划的决定性因素应当是人的自觉的劳动。我们的计划不能用平均定额而应该用平均先进定额作为依据，计划是要按照把落后的生产定额提高到先进定额的方向来编制的。譬如，有三个制造同一型式产品的小组，这三个小组都是在同样条件下进行工作的，根据过去时间的计算，在劳动生产率和产品制造数量方面，第一小组完成计划百分之九十，第二小组是百分之百，第三小组是百分之一百一十，那末平均生产率是百分之百。如果按平均定额编制计划，根据这个例子，三个小组的产量和劳动生产率应该是百分之百，也就是等于和过去的定额一样，这样一来，生产率达到百分之一百一十的小组接到一个比已达到的劳动生产率还要低百分之十的新计划，就会感到不需要紧张的劳动就可以完成它，第二个小组同样也可以不费力气地完成计划，这种方法是让落后拖住先进的做法，是不对的。有些人害怕修改定额，认为“修改定额会引起麻烦”，这是错误的，必须使计划“决定于先进的工人、工程师和技师，因为他们表现出能达到高度先进技术定额的可能性，以及保证超额完成国家计划”（一九四七年苏联部长会议关于国家经济问题的决议）。计划的先进性取决于定额的先进性，中长铁路时期哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂在苏联专家直接领导下，从一九五○年起就开始按消耗项目制订每单位产品的经验统计定额，以这个定额为基础逐步提高。一九五一年的定额已经不是平均的而是较平均数字略高的定额。人工消耗标准平均降低了百分之五到二十，材料消耗较铁道部规定降低了百分之三十五到六十，到了一九五二年各项指标中各项主要产品的工时消耗和材料消耗定额已由经验统计定额改为技术查定定额。如用黑色金属代替有色金属就节省了材料费一百零三亿元，这对于降低定额起了很大的作用。中长铁路时期，工厂坚决反对那种不分析工作中各种人为的缺点，笼统地制成包括各种损失在内的统计定额，这种定额只能绞杀工人的积极性和创造性，使企业领导方面走向脱离群众、官僚主义的道路。工厂在日常工作中根据每种产品支出项目的实际统计资料，分析研究那些发挥工厂最高生产能力的先进因素来制定定额。他们执行了一条正确的原则：每年的各种定额一定要低于实际达到的平均定额。这才能组织群众生产热情的不断高涨。
    先进的计划要反映出工人阶级生产的现实成就。它是依据生产不断上涨和吸引群众自觉参加的原则来编制和执行的。斯大林同志曾指出：“……如果以为生产计划就是一张数字表和工作任务一览表，那就是愚蠢的想法了。其实，生产计划是千百万人底活的实际行动。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是创造新生活的千百万劳动者。我们的生产计划底实在性，就是活的人，就是我们自己，我们的劳动意志，我们按新工作方法来工作的决心，我们执行计划的决心……”（列宁主义问题）。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂计划基本特征之一便是同群众日常劳动密切结合，同群众劳动形式——竞赛相结合。工厂的生产财务计划是建立在车间生产财务计划基础之上的。车间的计划是根据工人创造性的劳动所获得的生产成绩而制订的。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂从一九五○年五月一日中苏共管之日起，便把上级批准的生产财务计划发给每一个执行人，组织全体职工讨论研究计划中的主要指标，讨论的结果统一了全厂职工思想和行动，然后由职工自觉地提出保证完成计划任务和技术经济指标的具体条件，这些保证条件都比原计划任务为高，它是以完成工厂一切指标、掌握先进工作方法、提高全体员工政治觉悟和技术水平为内容的。保证条件确定后，大家根据保证条件展开了劳动竞赛，在竞赛中，及时表扬和奖励突破旧定额的先进人物。工厂明确规定：先进的标准就是打破陈旧定额树立新定额而不是其它。在竞赛中出现了争取优胜质量产品的小组、先进模范车间等，涌现了大批的先进生产者和劳动模范。一九五○年职工劳动竞赛的结果，完成了原计划的百分之一百二十二，这个数字就成了原编制一九五一年计划的根据，体现生产不断上涨和成本不断降低的原则。在编计划时，也曾有人借口“机器老”，“生产面积小”，认为“生产到顶”，“无法再先进”，这种落后思想受到严格批判。工厂根据生产增长速度来编制计划。如第一年提高的生产率和生产量是百分之十，第二年工厂在不增加新的设备条件下应该用第一年增长百分之十的生产速度来编制计划。计划反映了生产发展的现实而不是反映向客观困难屈服。
    现在，有些工厂明明是订了落后的计划（这只要拿去年计划对比就可以看出）却认为是“不能再先进了”。那就请检查一下是否在计划中具备了这些社会主义企业计划缺一不可的基本条件吧。这也是用总路线精神来检查工作的一个方法。
