Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency on April 10th, the Vietnam Labor Party's organ "People's Daily" published an editorial in its recent issue, commenting on the struggle of the people of the three Indochinese countries for peace and national independence.

The editorial stated: The struggle of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, closely united in the past nearly eight years against imperialist aggressors and for national independence and unification, has caused the enemy to lose hundreds of thousands of troops on the three battlefields of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The conspiracy of the French and American imperialists to divide the people of the three countries has failed. The establishment of the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos People's Alliance in March 1951 marked a great political victory for the people of the three countries. Since then, they have achieved greater and greater successes. At present, the Lao liberated area covers approximately 100,000 square kilometers with a population of approximately one million. The Cambodian liberated areas and guerrilla bases have also expanded. The liberated areas of Vietnam and Laos, as well as Vietnam and Cambodia, have been connected in many places.

The editorial stated: The French colonialists have fallen into a situation that has never been so passive and embarrassing. However, the American imperialists are intensifying their intervention in the Indochina War, forcing the French colonialists to continue fighting in Indochina.

The editorial stated: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Huang Minhjian, protested against the interventionist actions of the American imperialists on March 8th. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Cambodian Resistance Government, Gao Mani, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Resistance Government, Nuoha· Fengshawan, also issued statements on March 20th and March 26th respectively, denouncing the American imperialists' direct intervention in the Indochina War. The position of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos is consistent: the three countries must achieve true independence and peace. This explains why the foreign ministers of the three countries, representing the governments of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, unanimously supported the convening of the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The editorial continued: This correct position of the Indochinese people has been enthusiastically supported by peace-loving people all over the world. However, the French colonialists and American interventionists continue to disregard this position of the Indochinese people.

The editorial stated: The American imperialists are attempting to expand their dirty war of intervention in Indochina. The talks held in Washington in late March between French Chief of Staff Ély and American President Eisenhower and Secretary of Defense Wilson clearly show that the American imperialists are deliberately intensifying their intervention in the Indochina War. In a speech on March 29th, US Secretary of State Dulles slandered the People's Republic of China and openly threatened to take "united action" against the people of Indochina.

The editorial stated: The American imperialists are attempting to tie the French colonialists to their war chariot, forcing them to continue fighting in Indochina in order to continue forcing French youth to serve as cannon fodder for them. Although the Laniel government verbally claims to want to end the war, it actually wants to follow the will of the United States and continue the war. However, the movement of the French people demanding an end to the war is growing. The recent remarks of the American imperialists have aroused the indignation of French public opinion.

The editorial stated: The French colonialists and American interventionists are attempting to conquer the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. However, the people of the three Indochinese countries, who have been fighting side by side for nearly eight years, have clearly realized that the struggle for national independence and peace, and a free life, is an arduous struggle, but one that will inevitably be victorious. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, united closely, are full of confidence in crushing all the conspiracies of the imperialists.

    越南“人民报”论印度支那人民的胜利斗争
    三国必须实现真正的独立与和平
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社十日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在最近的一期上发表社论，评论印度支那三国人民争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    社论说：越南、高棉、寮国三国人民在过去将近八年中紧密地团结在一起进行的反对帝国主义侵略者、争取民族独立和统一的斗争，使得敌人在越南、高棉和寮国三个战场上损失了几十万名军队。法、美帝国主义者企图分裂三国人民的阴谋已经失败。一九五一年三月间越南—高棉—寮国人民联盟的宣告成立，更标志着三国人民在政治上的巨大胜利。自此之后，他们获得了越来越大的成就。目前，寮国解放区的面积约有十万平方公里，人口约一百万。高棉的解放区和游击根据地也扩大了。越南和寮国以及越南和高棉的解放区在许多地方已经连成一片。
    社论说：法国殖民者已经陷于从来没有像现在这样被动和窘困的境地。但是，美帝国主义者正在加紧干涉印度支那的战争，逼迫法国殖民者在印度支那继续打下去。
    社论说：越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴已在三月八日对美帝国主义者的干涉行动提出抗议。高棉抗战政府外交部长高玛尼与寮国抗战政府外交部长诺哈·冯沙万也已分别在三月二十日和三月二十六日发表声明，斥责美帝国主义者直接干涉印度支那的战争。越南、高棉与寮国三国人民的立场是一致的：三国必须实现真正的独立与和平。这就说明了为什么三国外交部长代表越南、高棉与寮国人民政府一致拥护召开日内瓦会议，讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题。社论接着说：印度支那人民的这种正确的立场，受到全世界爱好和平人士的热烈拥护。但是，法国殖民者和美国干涉者对印度支那人民的这种立场仍然置之不顾。
    社论说：美帝国主义者正在企图扩大干涉印度支那的肮脏的战争。法国总参谋长埃利和美国总统艾森豪威尔以及国防部长威尔逊三月下旬在华盛顿进行的会谈，就清楚地表明了美国帝国主义者蓄意加紧干涉印度支那的战争。美国国务卿杜勒斯在三月二十九日发表的演说中诬蔑中华人民共和国，并且公开威胁要对印度支那人民采取“联合行动”。
    社论说：美帝国主义者企图把法国殖民者缚在他们的战车上，迫使它在印度支那继续打下去以便继续强迫法国青年为他们充当炮灰。拉尼埃集团虽然口头上要停止战争，实际上却要遵照美国的意旨，继续进行战争。但是，法国人民的要求结束战争的运动正在日益高涨。美国帝国主义者的最近的言论已经引起了法国舆论的愤慨。
    社论说：法国殖民者和美国干涉者企图征服越南、高棉和寮国人民。但是在过去将近八年中一直并肩作战的印度支那三国人民已经清楚地认识到：争取民族独立与和平、自由的生活的斗争是一个艰巨的、但是必然获得胜利的斗争。越南、高棉、寮国三国人民在紧密的团结下，怀有充分的信心粉碎帝国主义者的所有阴谋。
