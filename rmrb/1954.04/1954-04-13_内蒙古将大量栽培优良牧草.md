Inner Mongolia will cultivate large quantities of high-quality forage grasses this year to improve grasslands in pastoral areas and further address the shortage of livestock feed in some agricultural and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas.

According to the situation of forage grass cultivation promotion last year and the amount of grass seeds requested by local governments this year, the Animal Husbandry Bureau of the Agricultural and Pastoral Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government has distributed 55,000 jin of alfalfa seeds to various locations since early March, so as to cultivate them in a timely manner. This year, the region plans to promote and trial-plant alfalfa on more than 21,800 mu, with more than 1,600 mu trial-planted in the eastern region and more than 20,200 mu promoted in the western region; the Ikezhao League will sow 77,200 mu of local forage grasses. The survival rate of forage grasses cultivated by the masses is required to be above 50%, and the survival rate of forage grasses cultivated by state-owned farms and ranches should be above 80%.

In order to do a good job in cultivating forage grasses, the Animal Husbandry Bureau has already formulated a 1954 forage grass cultivation plan, requiring governments at all levels to act in accordance with the policy of "active leadership, steady promotion, comprehensive deployment, and key cultivation." It has also printed a booklet on the cultivation methods of alfalfa to solve the technical problems of cultivating high-quality alfalfa forage grass. It also plans to pay attention to solving the problems existing in the cultivation of forage grass at any time during the growing period of forage grass in combination with various tasks.

In addition, the Animal Husbandry Bureau has also opened up experimental areas for cultivating high-quality forage grasses to trial-plant various forage grasses. It plans to use two to three years of cultivation time to promote high-quality forage grasses that have been proven to grow vigorously and have high feed value through experiments, so as to gradually achieve the purpose of improving the grasslands in this region and improving the quality of livestock.

    内蒙古将大量栽培优良牧草
    为了改良牧区草原和进一步解决部分农业区、半农半牧区牲畜饲草不足的问题，今年内蒙古全区将大量栽培优良牧草。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部畜牧局根据去年推广栽培牧草的情况和今年各地人民政府申请需要草籽的数量，从三月上旬起，就把五万五千斤紫花苜蓿籽种发放到各地，以便适时栽培。今年全区计划推广及试种紫花苜蓿两万一千八百多亩，东部区试种一千六百多亩，西部区推广两万零二百多亩；伊克昭盟播种本地牧草七万七千二百亩。要求群众栽培的牧草成活率在百分之五十以上，国营农场、牧场栽培的牧草成活率应在百分之八十以上。
    为做好栽培牧草工作，畜牧局早已制订出一九五四年栽培牧草方案，要求各级政府按“积极领导，稳步推广，全面布置，重点栽培”的方针去办事。并印发紫花苜蓿栽培法的小册子，解决栽培紫花苜蓿优良牧草的技术问题。还计划在牧草生长期间结合各项工作，随时注意解决栽培牧草工作中所存在的问题。
    另外，畜牧局又开辟了栽培优良牧草试验区，试种各种牧草。打算利用两年到三年的栽培时间，把经过试验证明生长茂盛饲料价值高的优良牧草加以推广，以便逐步达到改良本区草原和提高牲畜质量的目的。
