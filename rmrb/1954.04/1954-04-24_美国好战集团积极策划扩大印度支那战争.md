Title: U.S. Warmongering Group Actively Plots to Expand Indochina War

    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Many signs indicate that, with the approach of the Geneva Conference, the U.S. warmongering group, craving world hegemony and worried about the U.S. economic crisis, is becoming increasingly alarmed and anxious. They are extremely afraid that the Geneva Conference will lead to the cessation of the Indochina War and that the Geneva Conference will further ease tensions in Asia and the world. Therefore, they are even more frantically inciting war hysteria and actively planning new adventures to expand the Indochina War, attempting to sabotage the Geneva Conference and reverse the trend towards easing tensions, which had begun with the Korean armistice and the Berlin Conference agreements.
    U.S. Air Forces in Europe announced on the 21st that they have been ordered to begin airlifting French troops from Europe and North Africa to reinforce Indochina. This action announced by the U.S. Air Force is a new development in a series of measures taken by the U.S. government before the Geneva Conference to interfere in the Indochina War and obstruct negotiations.
    Dulles' mission to Western Europe to coerce France and Britain into a "joint action" to sabotage the Geneva Conference and participate in the expanded Indochina War failed to achieve its goals because British, French, and world public opinion universally demanded an agreement at the Geneva Conference. After this, U.S. Vice President Nixon delivered a speech on April 16th. Nixon expressed the U.S.'s firm opposition to stopping the Indochina War through negotiations. He even openly threatened that the U.S. was prepared to send troops itself to directly participate in the Indochina War, thereby coercing France to continue fighting in Indochina and not to implement independent policies at the Geneva Conference or have any freedom to negotiate. In coordination with Nixon's war cries, some reactionary U.S. senators also issued a series of talks. Nixon's speech reflects the adventurous policy of expanding the Indochina War that the U.S. government is currently pursuing. Even the U.S. State Department's statement on Nixon's speech did not deny this.
    In fact, U.S. authorities have been interfering in the Indochina War step by step. The U.S. has already sent two aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Tonkin to provoke the people of Indochina. The U.S. is accelerating the transport of aircraft to Indochina. At the Philippine Air Force base, U.S. troops are busy painting over the U.S. insignia on the aircraft and painting on French markings. In addition to the U.S. Air Force directly flying aircraft to Indochina air bases, a recent aircraft carrier transported a batch of Corsair fighter-bombers from Japan to Indochina. The U.S. Air Force has drawn a large number of aircraft from Japan, Korea, and even Western Europe to carry out urgent missions and rush ammunition and combat materials to Indochina. News reports say that this airlift is increasing daily. The scale of U.S. military personnel activity in the Indochina battlefield is growing larger and larger. Even a United Press International dispatch from Manila on the 19th admitted that "Americans are now on the firing line in Indochina." "In fact, the airlift effort to support the besieged (French) garrison at Dien Bien Phu is an American operation." "U.S. military supplies delivered to the Dien Bien Phu garrison are loaded onto giant aircraft under the direction of experienced U.S. paratroopers." Although U.S. government leaders have repeatedly said that the "technicians" that the U.S. has sent to Indochina will withdraw from the combat area in June as planned, United Press International news reports indicate that the number of U.S. personnel in Indochina is increasing, and "a rotation plan to replace those who have reached the maximum service period of one hundred and twenty days has already been drawn up with new personnel."
    U.S. newspapers have recently revealed more and more such news, indicating that the U.S. government is actively preparing in all aspects for further direct involvement in the Indochina War. The "Washington Post" published an article by Pearson on April 12th, which stated that Dulles and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford made two suggestions at a recent secret meeting between the government and senior congressional leaders. One suggestion was to give the President the power "to do everything he deems appropriate to prevent Indochina from falling into the hands of the Communists." The other suggestion planned some specific measures for the direct participation of U.S. troops in the war, including: "Sending four aircraft carriers from the Philippines to anchor off the coast of Indochina to bomb the Communists; using long-range bombers stationed in the Philippines to destroy the Communist supply lines and ammunition depots." U.S. Republican Senator Knowland openly told reporters on April 17th that the possibility of sending naval and air forces had been considered, and the possibility of sending ground troops to Indochina was not unimaginable.
    At the same time, the U.S. is proclaiming that the U.S. Navy and Air Force are on standby, ready to participate in the Indochina War. A United Press International dispatch from Hong Kong on the 18th reported that senior U.S. military officials announced when the U.S. aircraft carriers had entered the Gulf of Tonkin that as long as the U.S. government ordered it, "the Navy could immediately take" direct military action. The aforementioned United Press International dispatch from Manila on the 19th also said that "only an order from Washington is required." "U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots will be the first to fight the Communists in Indochina." The combat aircraft on the two aircraft carriers currently anchored in Manila Bay are "on standby on the flight deck."
    The U.S. warmongers are clearly eager to expand the flames of war in Indochina and further undermine peace and security in the Asian region. This U.S. adventurous conspiracy is an open provocation to the Asian people's desire for peace. The peace-loving people of Asia and the world are increasingly taking the cause of maintaining peace and security into their own hands. If the U.S. adventurers disregard the people's will for peace, they are bound to suffer setbacks sooner or later.

### 美国好战集团积极策划扩大印度支那战争

    美国好战集团积极策划扩大印度支那战争
    【新华社二十二日讯】许多迹象显示：随着日内瓦会议的迫近，渴望着世界霸权和担忧着美国经济危机的美国好战集团越加惊惶焦急了，他们极其害怕日内瓦会议会导致印度支那战争的停止，害怕日内瓦会议会进一步缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势。因此，他们正在更加疯狂地煽动战争歇斯底里，积极策划扩大印度支那战争的新的冒险，企图破坏日内瓦会议，使已经因朝鲜停战和柏林会议的协议而开始缓和的局势转趋紧张。
    美国驻欧洲空军二十一日宣布，它已奉令开始自欧洲及北非空运法国军队向印度支那增援。美国空军宣布的这一行动是美国政府在日内瓦会议前采取的一连串干涉印度支那战争、阻挠谈判的措施的新的发展。
    杜勒斯到西欧去胁迫法国和英国破坏日内瓦会议参加扩大印度支那战争的“联合行动”的使命，因为英、法和世界各国舆论普遍要求在日内瓦会议上谋求协议而未能如愿以偿。在这以后，美国副总统尼克松又在四月十六日发表演说。尼克松表示美国坚决反对通过谈判停止印度支那的战争，他甚至公然威胁说美国准备自己派遣军队直接参加印度支那战争，借以胁迫法国必须在印度支那打下去，而不得在日内瓦会议上执行独立的政策，有任何进行协商的自由。配合着尼克松的战争叫嚣，美国一些反动参议员也发表了一连串的谈话。尼克松的演说反映着美国政府目前正在推行的扩大印度支那战争的冒险政策。连美国国务院就尼克松演说所发表的声明中也没有否认这一点。
    事实上，美国当局已经在一步紧一步地干涉印度支那战争。美国已经派遣两艘航空母舰驶入东京湾向印度支那人民进行挑衅示威。美国正在加紧运送飞机到印度支那去。在菲律宾空军基地上，美军正忙着把飞机上的美国国徽涂去，而涂上法国标记。除美国空军直接把飞机飞到印度支那空军基地去外，最近还有一艘航空母舰把一批海贼式战斗轰炸机自日本运到印度支那去。美国空军自日本、朝鲜以至西欧抽调了大批飞机，来执行紧急任务，把弹药及作战物资赶运到印度支那去。消息说，这种空运每天都在增加。在印度支那战地，美国军事人员活动的规模正越来越大。连合众社马尼拉十九日电也承认：“美国人现在正在印度支那的火线上”。“实际上，支援奠边府被围（法国）守军所进行的空运努力是美国的工作”。“运给奠边府守军的美国军用物资是在有经验的美军伞兵指挥下装载到巨型飞机上去的”。虽然美国政府首脑一再说美国已经派到印度支那去的“技术人员”将按预定计划在六月间退出战斗地区，但是，合众社消息指出，美国在印度支那人员的数目正在增加，而且“以新的人员来替换那些已达到一百二十天最高服役期限的人的轮换计划前已拟出”。
    美国报纸近来透露愈来愈多这样的消息，说明：美国政府正在各方面积极进行着进一步直接参与印度支那战争的准备。“华盛顿邮报”四月十二日刊载了皮尔逊的一篇文章，其中就说，杜勒斯和美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在最近政府与国会高级领袖们举行的一次秘密会议上提出了两个建议。一个建议是要国会给予总统以权力，“使他能作一切他认为宜于防止印度支那落入共产党之手的事情”。另外一个建议规划了美国军队直接参加战争的某些具体措施，包括：“从菲律宾派遣四艘航空母舰停泊在印度支那沿海以轰炸共军；使用驻在菲律宾的远程轰炸机来摧毁共方的供应线和军火基地”。美国共和党参议员诺兰四月十七日公开对记者说，派遣海空军的可能性已经考虑过了，派遣地面部队到印度支那去的可能性也不是不可想像的。
    同时，美国正扬言美国海军及空军已在待命准备参与印度支那战争。合众社香港十八日电报道，美国高级军界人士在宣布美国二艘航空母舰已驶入东京湾时说，只要美国政府下令，“海军马上就可采取”直接军事行动。上述合众社马尼拉十九日电也说，“只须华盛顿发布一个命令”。“美国空军及海军飞机驾驶员将首先和印度支那的共军作战”。目前停泊在马尼拉湾中的两艘航空母舰上的作战飞机已“在飞行甲板上待命”。
    美国的玩火者显然在跃跃欲试地企图扩大印度支那的战火，进一步破坏亚洲地区的和平和安全。美国这种冒险阴谋是对亚洲人民的和平愿望的公开挑衅。亚洲和世界爱好和平人民正在日益把维护和平与安全事业掌握到自己手里。美国冒险家要是无视人民的这种和平意志，迟早一定要碰得头破血流。
