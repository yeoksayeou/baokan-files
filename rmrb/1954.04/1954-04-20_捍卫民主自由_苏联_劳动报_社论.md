    Defend Democratic Freedom
    – Editorial from the Soviet "Trud"

    In capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies, the struggle to defend and fight for democratic freedoms and trade union rights is expanding daily. Millions of working people of all races, nationalities, professions, and political beliefs are participating in this movement. This movement is of particularly important significance today, as the clouds of an impending economic crisis are gathering on the horizon of the capitalist world. The accumulation of vast quantities of goods in warehouses, unsalable because ordinary people do not have the money to buy them, is a clear indication of this crisis. The signs of crisis are manifested in the reduction of production in peaceful industrial sectors and the decline of agriculture. The signs of crisis are manifested in the rapid increase of the vast numbers of unemployed, with five million jobless in the United States alone; it is manifested in the absolute and relative impoverishment of the broad masses of working people. These and many other facts undeniably confirm that the capitalist economy is encountering increasingly serious difficulties and is gradually entering a period of outbreaks and shocks.

    Under these circumstances, capitalists around the world, in order to obtain maximum profits, are taking all kinds of measures to shift the burden of the approaching crisis onto the shoulders of working people and to further strengthen the exploitation and enslavement of working people. In capitalist countries, the persecution of working people and the masses is intensifying. The spearhead of the reactionary forces' attack is aimed at all the democratic freedoms won by the people, and the target of this attack is primarily trade union rights, freedom of association, and the right to strike.

    American imperialism is the ringleader of this reactionary offensive. American imperialism is obstructing the organization of working people at all costs, refusing to allow them to have their own will and their own beliefs. To this end, they are increasingly widely adopting the methods of the extremely reactionary McCarthyist Black Hundreds to stifle any expression of free will. To this end, they have implemented the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, which in essence aims to abolish the workers' right to strike. The actions of American reactionary forces are not limited to the United States. Under the orders and pressure of American reactionaries, in countries subordinate to the United States, tyrannical suppression of the strike movement, illegal arrests of worker activists, and dissolution of trade unions are being carried out or are being prepared.

    However, the working class under the leadership of the glorious Communist and Workers' Parties and the progressive trade union organizations under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) are blocking the path of the reactionary forces.

    The WFTU is a true organization of the working people, with over eighty million workers, staff, tenant farmers, and agricultural worker members in its ranks in sixty-four countries. The WFTU has always tirelessly and persistently defended and fought for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, calling all those who value glory and freedom, democracy, and independence to rally under its banner. It has consistently pointed out that to win in the struggle for bread, labor, and a better life, working people must defend and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

    The Third World Congress of Trade Unions, representing the will of the working people, decided to launch a broad international movement from May 1, 1954, to defend and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms. The Congress also entrusted the leading bodies of the WFTU to draft a charter on the trade union rights and democratic rights of working people, which must be implemented in all countries, including colonial and semi-colonial countries. This charter will be printed in the languages of all countries and distributed in all countries, in urban and rural enterprises. This charter will be submitted to national parliaments and various democratic assemblies for adoption and will be submitted to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the International Labour Organization for adoption. The WFTU, faithful to the interests and will of the working class, has already begun to implement this extremely important decision of the Congress. The Executive Bureau of the WFTU recently held a meeting in Vienna, adopted a declaration on the basic principles of trade union rights of the world's working people, and has submitted it to the working people of all countries for broad discussion. Throughout the world, these principles, which safeguard the fundamental interests of the ordinary people of all countries, are being studied and discussed. Through this nationwide discussion in all countries, the solidarity of the working people will be further consolidated, and their determination to block the path of the reactionary forces will be further enhanced. The WFTU knows that the struggle to defend the interests of the working class and protect trade union rights is closely linked to the struggle of the people of all countries for freedom and national independence, for economic and social progress, and for world peace. The WFTU calls on the people of all countries to tirelessly fight against the revival of German militarism, against any military agreements similar to the Bonn and Paris treaties, against the arms race, and to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    In these days of preparing for the international festival of the great solidarity of the working people of all countries—International Labor Day on May 1st—the working class of the whole world responds to this call, unites more closely under the banner of the WFTU, strengthens trade union unity, and actively protects and strives for trade union rights, striving for world peace. The growing strike movements in capitalist countries such as France, Italy, and Britain illustrate this, with the increasingly united actions of the proletariat in these countries attracting more and more masses.

    The increasing number of people in the United States who oppose the policies of the aggressive blocs, strive to ease the international situation, and oppose American intervention in the Indochina war also illustrates this. The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers recently reported that its meeting passed a resolution demanding that the U.S. government immediately take measures to "end the protracted and costly war in Vietnam." In defending trade union rights and democratic freedoms and striving to consolidate peace, working people resolutely condemn the betrayal of the splitters of trade unions, especially the reactionary bosses of American trade unions—the faithful agents of imperialism.

    The working class of all countries is increasingly aware that only by uniting their ranks can the working class protect and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, safeguard the cause of peace, and guarantee a better future.

### 捍卫民主自由——苏联“劳动报”社论

    捍卫民主自由
    ——苏联“劳动报”社论
    各资本主义国家及殖民地与附属国内，保卫与争取民主自由和工会权利的斗争日见扩大。各种不同种族、民族、职业和政治信仰的千百万劳动人民都参加了这一运动。这一运动在今天更具有特别重要的意义，因为现在日益迫近的经济危机的乌云已散布在资本主义世界的天边。大量商品由于普通人没有钱来买而堆积在仓库中，从这里可以明显看出这一危机的象征。危机的象征表现在和平工业部门的减产和农业的衰退中。危机的象征表现在大量失业人口的迅速增加中，仅在美国的失业者就有五百万人；它表现在广大劳动群众绝对地与相对地贫困化中。这些及其他的许多事实无可争辩地证实：资本主义的经济正遭遇到愈益严重的困难，又渐渐进入一个爆发与震荡的时期。
    在这种情形下，全世界的资本家为了获得最大限度的利润，都在采取各种办法，把日益迫近的危机的重担推到劳动人民的肩上，并进一步加强对劳动人民的剥削和奴役。在各资本主义国家中，劳动人民及人民群众所遭到的迫害越来越加强了。反动势力的进攻的矛头指向人民所争得的一切民主自由，而这一进攻的打击对象首先是工会权利、结社自由和罢工的权利。
    美国帝国主义是这一反动势力进攻的魁首。美国帝国主义不惜一切代价阻挠劳动人民组织起来，不许他们有自己的意志，有自己的信仰。为了这个目的，他们日益广泛地采用极端反动的麦卡锡主义的黑色百人团的手段，来扼杀一切自由意志的表现。为了这个目的，他们施行了塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，这一法律的目的实质上是要取消工人的罢工权利。美国反动势力的行动不限于美国。在美国反动派的命令和压力下，在从属于美国的各国内，正在或正在准备对罢工运动进行横暴的镇压，非法逮捕工人积极分子和解散工会。
    但是，在光荣的共产党和工人党领导下的工人阶级和在世界工会联合会领导下的进步工会组织，阻挡着反动势力的道路。
    世界工联是真正的劳动人民的组织，在它的队伍里拥有六十四个国家的八千多万工人、职员、雇农和农业工人会员。世界工会联合会过去和现在一直不倦地、坚持不渝地维护和争取工会权利及民主自由，把所有重视光荣和自由、民主和独立的人们召唤在自己的旗帜下。它过去和现在一贯指出，劳动人民要在争取面包、劳动和美好生活的斗争中取得胜利，就必须维护和争取工会权利和民主自由。
    世界工会第三次代表大会代表劳动人民的意志，决定从一九五四年五月一日起，开始广泛地展开一个国际运动，来保卫和争取工会权利和民主自由。代表大会同时委托世界工联领导机构草拟一个关于劳动人民的工会权利和民主权利的章程，所有的国家，包括殖民地和半殖民地国家在内，都必须实行这一章程。这个章程将用各国文字印就，在各国、各城乡企业中散发。这一章程将提交各国议会和各种民主集会通过，并将提交联合国经济与社会理事会和国际劳工组织通过。世界工会联合会忠实于工人阶级的利益和意志，已经着手执行代表大会这一极其重要的决定。世界工会联合会执行局不久前在维也纳召开了一次会议，通过了关于世界劳动人民的工会权利基本原则的宣言，并已提交各国劳动人民进行广泛讨论。在全世界各国内，正在就这些维护各国普通人民根本利益的原则，展开研究和讨论。通过这次各国的全国性的讨论，劳动人民的团结将得到进一步的巩固，他们阻挡反动派进攻的道路的决心将得到进一步的提高。世界工会联合会知道，开展维护工人阶级利益、保护工会权利的斗争，是与各国人民争取自由与民族独立，争取经济和社会进步和争取世界和平的斗争有密切联系的。世界工会联合会号召各国人民不倦地斗争来反对德国军国主义复活，反对任何类似波恩和巴黎条约的军事协定，反对军备竞赛，争取和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平。
    在准备各国劳动人民大团结的国际节日——“五一”国际劳动节的这些日子里，全世界的工人阶级响应这个号召，更加紧密地团结在世界工会联合会的旗帜下，加强工会的团结，积极地保护和争取工会权利，争取世界和平。像法国、意大利、英国这些资本主义国家中的罢工运动日益壮大，就说明这一点，在这些国家无产阶级的行动日益团结，吸引的群众越来越多。
    在美国越来越多的人反对侵略集团的政策，争取缓和国际局势，反对美国干涉印度支那战争，也说明这一点。国际开采冶炼工人工会组织最近报道，该工会的会议曾通过决议，要求美国政府立即采取措施“停止旷日持久的和花费巨大的越南战争”。在维护工会权利和民主自由，争取巩固和平时，劳动人民坚决谴责工会的分裂分子的出卖行为，首先谴责美国工会的反动头子——帝国主义的忠实代理人。
  各国工人阶级越来越明白，只有把自己的队伍团结一致，工人阶级才能够保护和争取到工会权利和民主自由，才能够维护和平的事业，保证美好的未来。
