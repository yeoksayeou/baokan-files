Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th: Farmers in Shandong Province are continuously selling large quantities of peanuts and cotton to the state. Farmers in the Laiyang Special District sold a total of 212.43 million jin of peanuts to the state from October of last year to March 25th of this year. The Jiaozhou, Linyi, and other special districts are currently able to collect 200,000 to 300,000 jin of peanuts every day. The purchase volume in Linyi Special District has increased since the end of March. By the end of March, Shandong Province had exceeded its annual peanut purchase plan (from October 1953 to the end of September 1954), and it is estimated that another 50 million jin can be purchased.

While expanding the cotton field planting area, farmers in the cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province continuously sell cotton to the state in exchange for means of production. Farmers in the Dezhou Special District sold 10,549 dan to the state in twenty days of March. The Dezhou Special District has now completed 92.75% of its annual cotton purchase plan. From September of last year to mid-March of this year, farmers in the Huimin Special District sold a total of 579,380 dan of cotton to the state, most of which is high-quality cotton that can be spun into high-count fine yarn. According to recent partial survey statistics from Dezhou, Huimin, Liaocheng, Jiaozhou, and other special districts, cotton farmers still have 15% to 20% of commercial cotton in storage, with some reaching over 30%. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are also preparing to continue selling the large amount of cotton they have stored to the state.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th: Shandong Province, which is rich in fruits, plans to reach a total output of 860 million jin of dozens of kinds of fresh fruits this year, including "Qingxiangjiao" apples, "Hongxiangjiao" apples, Laiyang pears, Feicheng peaches, Leling jujubes, and Dazeshan grapes, an increase of about 6.3% compared with last year. Since the beginning of spring, farmers who plant fruit trees in various places have generally carried out fertilization, pruning, and pest control. In the apple-producing areas of Xishawang, Muping County, Fushan County, Longkou in Yantai City, and the suburbs of Qingdao, farmers have sprayed most of the apple trees with lime-sulfur mixture to prevent and reduce apple brown spot disease. Currently, the peach-producing areas are in full bloom with peach blossoms, and the apple-producing areas have grown tender leaves on the trees and are waiting to bloom. Many fruit tree production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are actively improving production technology to increase yield per unit area.

In recent years, the agricultural and forestry departments of governments at all levels in Shandong Province have actively guided farmers to cultivate new orchards in mountainous areas and sandy beaches along the coast and rivers in order to increase the production of more fresh fruits to supply the domestic people and sell them far abroad. Various fruit trees planted from 1949 to 1952 are now growing vigorously. A large number of apple trees will blossom and bear fruit in another two or three years. This year, the province will also plant 3 million apple trees.

    山东省农民卖给国家大量花生仁和棉花
    全省今年计划生产水果八亿六千万斤
    【新华社济南六日电】　山东省农民陆续把大量花生仁和棉花卖给国家。莱阳专区的农民从去年十月到今年三月二十五日， 卖给国家的花生仁共有两亿一千二百四十三万斤。胶州、临沂等专区目前每天能收进二十万到三十万斤花生仁。临沂专区从三月下旬开始，收购量比以前又有增加。到三月底止，山东省收购花生的年度计划（从一九五三年十月到一九五四年九月底）已超额完成，估计还可再收购五千万斤左右。
    和扩大棉田种植面积的同时，山东省棉花产区的农民不断地把棉花卖给国家，换回生产资料。德州专区的农民在三月份二十天内，就卖给国家一万零五百四十九担。现在德州专区已完成棉花年度收购计划的百分之九十二点七五。惠民专区的农民从去年九月到今年三月中旬，卖给国家的棉花共有五十七万九千三百八十担，其中绝大部分是优质棉，可以纺高支数细纱。据德州、惠民、聊城、胶州等专区最近的部分调查材料统计，棉农现在还储存有占商品棉百分之十五到二十的棉花，个别的达到百分之三十以上。许多农业生产合作社和互助组还准备把储存的大量棉花继续卖给国家。
    【新华社济南六日电】　盛产水果的山东省，今年“青香蕉”苹果、“红香蕉”苹果、莱阳梨、肥城桃、乐陵枣、大泽山葡萄等数十种鲜果的总产量计划达到八亿六千万斤，比去年增产约百分之六点三。入春以来，各地种植果树的农民已相当普遍地进行了施肥、修枝和防治病虫害。苹果产地烟台市西沙旺、牟平县、福山县、龙口和青岛市郊区，农民们已用石灰硫磺合剂把大部分苹果树喷了一遍，以防治和减少苹果的褐斑病。目前，蜜桃产地已是桃花盛开，苹果产地树上已长出嫩叶，含苞待放。许多果树生产合作社和互助组正在积极改进生产技术，争取提高单位面积产量。
    几年来，山东省各级人民政府农林部门积极指导农民在山区和沿海、沿河的沙滩上培植新果树园，以增产更多的鲜果，供应国内人民和远销国外。在一九四九年到一九五二年栽植的各种果树，现在生长旺盛。其中大量苹果树再过二、三年就要开花结果。今年，全省还要栽植苹果树三百万株。
