Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Fourth Meeting of the Central Election Committee and the 213th Government Affairs Meeting of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council were jointly held on the afternoon of the 15th. The meeting was presided over by Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Central Election Committee. Committee member Deng Xiaoping gave a report on the progress of the current grassroots election work across the country.

Based on the suggestions put forward in the report by Committee member Deng Xiaoping, the meeting made decisions on several related issues concerning the upcoming convening of provincial, municipal, and county People's Congresses. Since the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has not yet been promulgated, and the organizational forms of local governments at all levels after the general election have yet to be determined, the current session of the provincial, municipal, and county People's Congresses will not elect their respective People's Governments at their first meetings. If county-level People's Governments must be re-elected due to special circumstances, they should be reported to and approved by the People's Government at the next higher level, and their organization will temporarily follow the original form. According to the above provisions, the provincial, municipal, and county People's Congresses should respectively invoke the provisions of the "Organizational Regulations for People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Provinces, Cities, and Counties" passed by the Fourth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on December 2, 1949, and be convened by their respective People's Governments. In order to ensure that the candidates for representatives stipulated in Articles 47 and 49 of the Electoral Law can be fully deliberated, and at the same time, to ensure that the convening of People's Congresses at all levels can be coordinated with each other, it is stipulated that county-level People's Congresses will be convened in June 1954; provincial and municipal People's Congresses are tentatively scheduled to be convened in late July or early August 1954; the People's Congresses of industrial cities under provincial jurisdiction with a population of more than 500,000 should be convened before the provincial People's Congresses. Representatives to the National People's Congress from industrial cities under provincial jurisdiction with a population of more than 500,000 should be elected by the provincial People's Congress concurrently.

The meeting also determined that ten industrial cities under provincial jurisdiction with a population of more than 500,000, including Nanjing, Qingdao, Chengdu, Jinan, Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Kunming, Tangshan, Changsha, and Wuxi, should elect one representative to the National People's Congress for every 100,000 people according to the provisions of Article 20 of the Electoral Law.

    中央选举委员会、政务院政务会议联合举行
    对召开省、市、县人民代表大会的问题作出决定
    【新华社十六日讯】中央选举委员会第四次会议和中央人民政府政务院第二百一十三次政务会议在十五日下午联合举行。会议由中央选举委员会刘少奇主席主持。邓小平委员在会上作了关于目前全国基层选举工作进展情况的报告。
    会议根据邓小平委员报告中所提出的建议，对于即将召开的省、市、县人民代表大会的几个有关问题作了决定。由于中华人民共和国宪法尚未公布，普选后的地方各级政权组织形式尚待确定，因此，省、市、县本届人民代表大会，不在首次会议上选举其本级人民政府；县一级人民政府如有特殊情况必须改选者，应报经上一级人民政府批准，其组织暂照原有的形式。根据上述规定，省、市、县人民代表大会应分别援引一九四九年十二月二日中央人民政府委员会第四次会议通过的省、市、县各界人民代表会议组织通则的规定，由其本级人民政府召开。为了使选举法第四十七条、第四十九条规定的代表候选人都能得到充分的酝酿，同时使各级人民代表大会的召开能互相衔接起见，规定县一级人民代表大会在一九五四年六月间召开；省、市人民代表大会暂定在一九五四年七月下旬或八月上旬召开；人口在五十万以上的省辖工业市人民代表大会应先于省人民代表大会召开。人口在五十万以上的省辖工业市应选到全国人民代表大会的代表由省人民代表大会一并选出。
    会议并确定南京、青岛、成都、济南、太原、杭州、昆明、唐山、长沙、无锡等十个人口在五十万以上的省辖工业市应按照选举法第二十条的规定，按人口每十万人选全国人民代表大会代表一人。
