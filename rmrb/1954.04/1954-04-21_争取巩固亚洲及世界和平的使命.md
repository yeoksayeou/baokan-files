    The conference to be held in Geneva on April 26, with the participation of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China—and other relevant countries, as agreed upon at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, is imminent. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, has appointed a delegation headed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to attend the Geneva Conference. The delegation departed for Geneva on April 20 to attend the conference. The important mission of our government delegation is, in line with the consistent peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, and in the spirit of sincerity and consultation, to work with all countries participating in the conference to seek the success of the Geneva Conference, achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, thereby contributing to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people unanimously support the great efforts of their government delegation for the solemn cause of peace.
    The great significance of the Geneva Conference lies in the fact that all participating countries, especially the major powers that bear special responsibility for maintaining world peace, will have the opportunity to reach agreements on the basis of mutual respect and equality, and in accordance with the vital interests of Asian countries and the common interests of world peace. Therefore, the Geneva Conference marks a starting point for the efforts of major powers to resolve international disputes through consultation and jointly safeguard international peace and security.
    From the first day of its founding, the People's Republic of China declared a clear and firm peaceful foreign policy, willing to establish diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit, in order to consolidate peace in Asia and the world. For more than four years, our country has established or is in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with twenty-five countries with a population of approximately one billion, including the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, as well as Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Pakistan. Currently, the number of countries establishing trade relations with China is increasing, and the governments or trade groups of more than twenty countries have signed trade agreements or contracts with China. China's cultural exchanges with various countries are also continuously increasing. All these facts vividly prove that the peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China is aimed at promoting and strengthening normal international relations and is conducive to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people believe that as long as all countries are willing to abide by the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit, there are no insurmountable obstacles to achieving the establishment of normal international relations.
    However, the ruling clique of the United States attempts to close its eyes to the fact of the existence and strength of the People's Republic of China, and tries its best to prevent the People's Republic of China from restoring its undeniable international rights and legitimate status. This hegemonic behavior of the US ruling clique does not diminish the ever-increasing international prestige and status of the People's Republic of China, but only exposes the aggressive ambitions of the US ruling clique to be hostile to the Chinese people, making it more isolated in international relations.
    The peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China is also fully reflected in the attitude and efforts of the Chinese people towards the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. The Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to defend the security of their motherland and peace in Asia, fought alongside the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to defeat the American aggressors, achieve the Korean armistice, and begin to ease international tensions. After the Korean armistice, the Korean-Chinese side made unremitting efforts to maintain the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to convene a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. On the Indochina issue, the Chinese people have consistently advocated restoring peace in Indochina based on the independence, freedom, and democratic aspirations of the Indochinese people. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement advocating a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue, which received the full support of the Chinese people. These are all facts known to all.
    The peaceful efforts of the Chinese people have made the international position and prestige of the People's Republic of China grow day by day. The agreement reached at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on convening the Geneva Conference clearly shows that the position and voice of the People's Republic of China in Asian and international affairs cannot be ignored. At the same time, this agreement also powerfully shows that the era in which imperialism arbitrarily manipulates the fate of the Asian people and the Asian people cannot intervene in Asian affairs has definitely gone forever. The Chinese people, who have stood up, are determined to work together with the people of Asian countries for peace in Asia and for the Asian people to control their own destiny. Anyone who ignores the will and determination of the Asian people is bound to fail.
    The convening of the Geneva Conference broke the deadlock on the Korean issue created by the United States, providing the possibility of seeking the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, so that the Korean people can seek the reunification of the country in a peaceful manner and transform Korea from an armistice to lasting peace. The Geneva Conference should also realize the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries, especially the people of Indochina and the French people, and restore peace in Indochina. The settlement of the Korean issue and the Indochina issue will undoubtedly eliminate the threat to peace and security in Asian countries, help consolidate peace in Asia and the world, and further ease the overall international situation. Therefore, this is entirely in line with the fundamental interests of Asian and world countries.
    However, the situation on the eve of the Geneva Conference shows that the US ruling clique continues to ignore the peaceful aspirations of the people of Asian and world countries, and is stepping up its efforts to continue to pursue a policy of aggression aimed at being hostile to the People's Republic of China and promoting neo-colonialism in Asia, in order to intensify international tensions and attempt to dominate the world. The US ruling clique regards the consistent peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China as the main obstacle to its conspiracy to enslave millions of people in Asia, and spares no effort to slander and vilify it by various despicable means. In particular, after the Berlin Conference reached an agreement on convening the Geneva Conference, the hostility and provocative attacks of the US ruling clique against the People's Republic of China reached an even more irrational level. The purpose of all these actions by the US ruling clique is to sabotage the Geneva Conference and carry out new adventures in Asia. Recently, the US diplomatic authorities have openly used pressure to force countries such as Britain and France to participate in "joint action," threatening France with no freedom of consultation at the Geneva Conference, and planning to establish a military alliance in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, threatening the peace and security of countries in this region. The United States is stepping up plans to expand the Indochina war. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford suggested sending aircraft carriers and air force to directly participate in the Indochina war. Two US aircraft carriers have sailed into the Indochina waters, preparing to take action. US Vice President Nixon even clamored to send US troops to Indochina.
    The Chinese people are vigilantly watching the military adventures that the United States is currently stepping up. The Chinese people will unswervingly fight for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. We do not invade others, and we resolutely oppose anyone's acts of aggression; we do not threaten others, and we resolutely oppose anyone's threats; we do not interfere in the internal affairs of others, and we resolutely oppose others interfering in anyone's internal affairs. We advocate peace and oppose war, but we will never ignore any armed aggression against us!
    The people of the world, especially the people of Asian countries, have great expectations for the upcoming Geneva Conference, hoping that the conference can achieve something in order to consolidate peace in Asia and the world and further ease international tensions. This universal aspiration is fully reflected in the public opinion and government attitudes of Asian and other countries. Public opinion in various countries attaches particular importance to the significance of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference, believing that major international issues, especially those related to Asia, cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. They condemned the increasingly intensified conspiracies of the US ruling clique to sabotage the Geneva Conference and its provocative policy of trying to expand the Indochina war. Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in Mumbai on April 11, criticizing the recent war hysteria clamor of the United States, and expressed: hope that the representatives attending the upcoming Geneva Conference will "calmly consider the urgent problems facing the world - the Korean and Indochina issues, and seek a solution for them, so that the world can achieve peace and happiness."
    The Chinese people will unite more closely with the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to strive to achieve the common goal: to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina, in order to consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

### 争取巩固亚洲及世界和平的使命

    争取巩固亚洲及世界和平的使命
    根据柏林四国外长会议的协议，在苏联、美国、法国、英国和中华人民共和国这五大国及其他有关国家参加下举行的会议，即将于四月二十六日在日内瓦举行。中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席已经任命了以外交部部长周恩来同志为首的出席日内瓦会议的代表团，代表团已于四月二十日启程前往日内瓦出席会议。我国政府代表团的重大使命是本着中华人民共和国一贯的和平外交政策，以诚意和协商的精神，与参加会议的各国一起谋求日内瓦会议的成功，实现和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平，从而有利于巩固亚洲及世界和平。中国人民一致支持自己的政府代表团为了庄严的和平事业而作的重大努力。
    日内瓦会议的重大意义是在于，所有参加会议的国家尤其是对维护世界和平事业负有特别责任的大国之间将有可能在互相尊重的平等地位上，根据亚洲各国的切身利益及世界和平的共同利益达成协议。因此，日内瓦会议标志着各大国以协商方式解决国际争端、共同维护国际和平与安全的努力的一个起点。
    中华人民共和国从它成立的第一天起，就宣布了明确而坚定的和平外交政策，愿在互相尊重领土主权及平等互利的基础上与各国建立外交、经济和文化关系，以巩固亚洲和世界的和平。四年多以来，我国已与人口约达十亿的二十五个国家建立了或正在建立外交关系，其中有苏联和各新民主主义国家，有印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家。目前与中国建立贸易关系的国家正日益增多，二十多个国家的政府或贸易团体已与中国签订了贸易协定或合同。中国与各国的文化交流也在不断地增进中。这一切事实都生动地证明了，中华人民共和国的和平外交政策是旨在促进和加强国际间的正常关系并有利于巩固亚洲及世界的和平。中国人民认为，只要各国都愿意遵守互相尊重领土主权及平等、互利的原则，就没有任何不可克服的障碍来实现国际间正常关系的建立。
    但是，美国统治集团企图闭着眼睛不看见中华人民共和国存在和强大的事实，竭力阻挠中华人民共和国恢复它的不容抹煞的国际权利和合法地位。美国统治集团这种专横行为，丝毫无损于中华人民共和国的国际声望和地位的日益提高，而只有暴露了美国统治集团敌视中国人民的侵略野心，使它自己在国际关系中更加趋于孤立。
    中华人民共和国的和平外交政策，也充分表现在中国人民对和平解决朝鲜问题及印度支那问题的态度和努力上面。中国人民志愿军为捍卫自己祖国的安全和亚洲的和平，曾与朝鲜人民及朝鲜人民军一道打败了美国侵略者，实现了朝鲜停战，使国际紧张局势开始有了缓和。朝鲜停战后，朝中方面又为维护朝鲜停战协议的实施，和召开政治会议以和平解决朝鲜问题，而作了不懈的努力。在印度支那问题方面，中国人民也一贯主张根据印度支那人民的独立自由和民主的愿望恢复印度支那的和平。越南民主共和国胡志明主席发表主张和平解决越南问题的声明，得到了中国人民的完全支持。这都是人所共见的事实。
    中国人民的和平努力，使中华人民共和国的国际地位和声望日益增长起来。柏林四国外长会议达成关于召开日内瓦会议的协议，就清楚地表明，中华人民共和国在亚洲和国际事务上的地位和发言权是不容抹煞的。同时，这个协议也有力地表明了，帝国主义任意摆布亚洲人民的命运，而亚洲人民不能过问亚洲问题的时代，是肯定地一去不复返了。站起来了的中国人民决心和亚洲各国人民一道，为了亚洲的和平和亚洲人民掌握自己的命运而共同努力。谁要漠视亚洲人民的这个意志和决心，谁就一定要遭到失败。
    日内瓦会议的召开，打破了美国所造成的朝鲜问题的僵局，为谋求从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，以便朝鲜人能以和平方式来谋求恢复国家的统一，使朝鲜从停战转入持久和平，提供了可能性。日内瓦会议也应该实现各国人民，特别是印度支那人民和法国人民的和平愿望，恢复印度支那的和平。朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的解决，无疑地将有可能消除亚洲各国和平与安全的威胁，有助于亚洲及世界和平的巩固和整个国际局势的进一步缓和，因而，这是完全符合于亚洲及世界各国的根本利益的。
    但是，日内瓦会议前夕的形势说明，美国统治集团依然无视亚洲及世界各国人民的和平愿望，正在加紧继续推行敌视中华人民共和国、和在亚洲推行新的殖民主义，以便加强国际紧张局势，妄图称霸世界的侵略政策。美国统治集团把中华人民共和国始终不渝的和平外交政策视为它实现奴役亚洲千百万人民的阴谋计划的主要障碍，不惜用种种卑劣的手段来加以诽谤和诬蔑。特别是柏林会议达成召开日内瓦会议的协议以后，美国统治集团对中华人民共和国的敌视和挑衅性攻击，达到了更加丧失理性的地步。美国统治集团这一切做法的目的，都是为了破坏日内瓦会议，在亚洲进行新的冒险。最近美国外交当局竟公开使用压力，逼迫英法等国参加“联合行动”，威胁法国不许在日内瓦会议有协商的自由，并策划在东南亚和西太平洋建立军事联盟，威胁这一地区各国的和平与安全。美国正在加紧计划扩大印度支那战争，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福建议派遣航空母舰和空军直接参加印度支那战争，美国两艘航空母舰已驶入印度支那海面，准备采取行动。美国副总统尼克松，又竟然叫嚣要派美国军队到印度支那去。
    中国人民警惕地注视着美国目前正在加紧进行的军事冒险。中国人民将坚定不移地为谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决和恢复印度支那的和平而斗争。我们不侵略别人，也坚决反对任何人的侵略行为；我们不威胁别人，也坚决反对任何人的威胁行为；我们不干涉别人的内政，也坚决反对别人干涉任何人的内政。我们主张和平，反对战争，但别人对我们的任何武装侵略，我们决不会置之不理！
    全世界人民特别是亚洲各国人民都对即将举行的日内瓦会议怀抱着极大的期望，希望这个会议能够有所成就，以便巩固亚洲及世界和平，进一步缓和国际紧张局势。这种普遍的愿望充分反映在亚洲及其他国家的舆论和政府的态度上面。各国公众舆论特别重视中华人民共和国参加日内瓦会议的意义，认为国际间特别是与亚洲有关的重大问题如果没有中华人民共和国的参加就不可能解决。他们对于美国统治集团最近变本加厉地阴谋破坏日内瓦会议，并力图推行扩大印度支那战争的挑衅性政策加以谴责。印度总理尼赫鲁四月十一日在孟买发表演说，抨击美国最近的战争歇斯底里的叫嚣，并表示：希望出席即将举行的日内瓦会议的代表们“冷静地考虑世界所面临的迫切问题——朝鲜和印度支那问题，为它们谋得一个解决的办法，这样世界才能得到和平与幸福。”
    中国人民将和亚洲及世界各国爱好和平的人民更紧密地团结在一起，争取实现共同的目标：和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平，以便巩固亚洲及世界和平。
