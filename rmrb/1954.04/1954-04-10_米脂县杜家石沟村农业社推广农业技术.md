The Dujia Shiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mizhi County, northern Shaanxi, has land located entirely in mountain gullies. Since the cooperative was established in 1950, members have increased the application of manure, plowing, and intercropping in the fields, and changed from broadcasting to row planting and ditch planting. However, they have not further adopted new farming techniques to transform the mountainous area. Some with conservative ideas even believe that a mountain gully is a mountain gully, and good crops cannot grow on poor land.

Last year, the People's Government sent a work team to help the cooperative promote new agricultural technologies. They mobilized some members to adopt close planting and seed dressing with pesticides during the spring sowing season and seized the opportunity to plant wheat quickly in the autumn when the soil was moist. Wherever these methods were used, yields were significantly increased, and wheat seedlings emerged completely. Last year, the cooperative's spring-sown crops such as sorghum and millet yielded an average of over 100 catties per mu, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year, and 34% higher than the yield of individual farmers in the area that year. Among them, six mu and four fen of high-yield sorghum fields yielded 281 catties of grain per mu. The first and fourth production teams of the cooperative, due to conservative ideas, did not adopt close planting (although seedlings were replenished) and seed dressing with pesticides for spring-sown crops, resulting in a total loss of more than 6,000 catties of grain compared to the second and third production teams, which accepted technical guidance from the work team. The third team planted 33 mu less of crops than the fourth team, but its total yield was more than 2,000 catties higher.

The facts of increased production have educated all members, effectively overcoming conservative ideas and enhancing their confidence in transforming the mountainous area. This year, the cooperative's production plan, in addition to deciding to adopt close planting, seed dressing with pesticides, increased fertilization, more weeding, terracing, and watering to strive for a greater harvest throughout the year, also decided to adopt a combined agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry management policy, planning to plant trees and forage grass on 49 mu of land, laying the foundation for future development of forestry and animal husbandry.

    米脂县杜家石沟村农业社推广农业技术
    陕北米脂县杜家石沟农业生产合作社，土地都在山沟里。自一九五○年建社后，社员们虽是在田里多施畜肥、多耕、倒槎，改撒播为安种、壕种；但大家却没有进一步地采用新的耕作技术来改造山区。有保守思想的人，还认为山沟就是山沟，薄地长不出好庄稼来。
    去年，人民政府派来工作组帮助该社推广新的农业技术。他们发动部分社员在春季播种时采用了密植和药剂拌种，在秋季天旱，趁墒抢种麦子。凡是采用这些办法的土地，产量都获得显著提高，麦苗也都出得齐全。去年全社高粱、谷子等春播作物，每亩平均产粮达一百斤以上。比前年增产百分之二十三。比当年当地单干农户产量高达百分之三十四。其中有六亩四分高粱丰产田，每亩收粮达二百八十一斤。该社第一、四生产小组，由于存在保守思想，春播作物没有采用密植（补过苗）和药剂拌种，要比接受工作组技术指导的第二、三生产小组，共少收六千多斤粮食。第三组比第四组少种三十三亩庄稼，总产量却比它多收二千多斤粮。
    增产事实教育了全体社员，有效地克服了保守思想，增强了改造山区的信心。今年，全社制定的生产计划，除决定采用密植、药剂拌种、增施肥料、多锄、修梯田、水地等办法，以争取全年的更大丰收外，还决定采取农、林、牧相结合的经营方针，计划在四十九亩地里植树和种牧草，打下今后发展林、畜业的基础。　（李根蒂）
