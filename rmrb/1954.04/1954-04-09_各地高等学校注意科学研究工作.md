    【This Newspaper News】In the past, although universities and colleges had done some scientific research work, it was generally individual and lacked planning. Since the National Comprehensive University Conference last September, universities have begun to pay more attention to this work.
    Many university teachers have specially studied the resolutions of the National Comprehensive University Conference, further clarifying the importance of scientific research work and recognizing that scientific research work combined with teaching can not only gradually improve their teaching level but also solve some practical problems in national construction. Now, an atmosphere of scientific research has emerged in some universities and colleges. In order to promote scientific research work, Shandong University and Shandong Agricultural College have organized specialized institutions to lead this work in a unified way. Lanzhou University, Sun Yat-sen University, Central South University of Finance and Economics, and other universities held scientific report meetings or scientific discussion meetings to promote scientific research work, which greatly encouraged teachers' enthusiasm for learning advanced Soviet science and conducting scientific research. Since 1950, under the active promotion of the school leadership and the help of Soviet experts, Renmin University of China has gradually carried out scientific research work from partial to comprehensive and from low to high, held regular scientific discussion meetings, and formulated methods such as scientific assignment evaluation and awards. The report on "Research on the Organization of Rhythmic Production According to Charts in the Northeast No. 3 Machinery Factory" at the school's third scientific discussion meeting aroused the attention of various enterprises. The leadership of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government believes that it can solve practical problems in the work. This academic year, a total of 399 teachers participated in scientific research, with 331 research topics. In addition, Northeast People's University has also held 42 scientific report meetings and seminars since the last semester and completed 12 scientific research papers.
    At present, many teaching and research groups and teachers in universities and colleges have put forward scientific research work plans based on specific situations, generally focusing on the problems that urgently need to be solved in current teaching; combining the study of Soviet textbooks and collecting relevant materials to enrich the content of textbooks. For example, teachers in the Department of Mathematics at Lanzhou University requested everyone to study Soviet textbooks and criticize idealist ideas in their plans; Professor Wu Zongfen of the Department of Economics, based on the theory of "Principles of Statistics" by Soviet scholar N.N. Ryazov, studied the actual materials of our country and prepared to adapt the textbooks according to the level of the students. Some teachers in psychology, biology, and other departments are studying the advanced scientific theories of Pavlov or Michurin. In the humanities, the content of scientific research work is generally to prepare professional courses, revise, discuss lecture notes, or compile textbooks. The Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University conducted special discussions on several important schools of thought in the pre-Qin period, such as Confucius, Lao Tzu, Mo Tzu, Xun Zi, and Han Fei, and studied how to correctly understand the social development at that time and use correct historical viewpoints and class analysis methods to analyze and criticize the thoughts of ancient philosophers.
    Some departments and teachers in some schools have established contacts with scientific research institutions, production departments, or administrative leadership departments. For example, teachers from the Departments of Biology, Oceanography, Fisheries, and Chemistry at Shandong University cooperated with the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Central Fisheries Experimental Institute, and the Shandong Aquatic Products Company to investigate the fishing grounds in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. Facts have proved that this kind of connection is necessary and helpful to both parties. For example, the Department of Mineral Processing at the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy compiled nine lecture notes for professional courses in the past year, and most of the materials were collected from relevant departments and factories. Some schools have signed technical cooperation contracts with factories or relevant departments on this basis. For example, the Northeast Institute of Technology and Shenyang Smelter recently signed a cooperation contract to strive to complete the research topics jointly agreed upon by both parties. In the research process, the factory should provide the necessary research materials, samples, and equipment, and invite production innovators and engineering technicians to give reports to teachers and students. The school should combine the actual problems in the factory's production to give special reports and answers to the cadres, technicians, and workers of the factory; regularly provide new information on non-ferrous metal smelting; assist the factory in formulating the teaching plan for technical schools and provide teaching reference materials. At present, teachers of the Non-ferrous Smelting Group of the Department of Metallurgy of the Northeast Institute of Technology have selected topics and started research with the help of Soviet experts.
    Judging from the situation in various schools, many teachers have adopted a positive attitude towards carrying out scientific research work. Some professors said, "If our cow does not eat grass well, there will not be enough milk." However, a few teachers believe that the teaching tasks are very heavy and it is difficult to carry out research work. In fact, as long as it is handled well, the two are complementary. For example, teachers from the Departments of Agronomy and Soil and Fertilizer at Nanjing Agricultural College used the information obtained in scientific research to revise or enrich the textbooks. In the past, the "Industrial Economy" course in the Department of Industrial Economics of Renmin University of China only had "The Production Plan of Soviet Industrial Departments" and lacked relevant teaching materials about our country. Later, Jin Hui, a teacher at the school, collected materials from internships and research work to compile textbooks. Teachers at East China University of Chemical Technology realized from research that only by going to the factory to see and do can they have a deeper understanding of the theoretical problems of principles. Engineers and workers will help them understand a lot of practical knowledge that is not in books, so that they have a basis for determining the content, focus, and experimental equipment of professional teaching materials. Lecturer Shi Yajun of the school used to feel unsure about teaching professional courses, but changed his mind after interning in the factory.

    各地高等学校注意科学研究工作
    【本报讯】高等学校的科学研究工作，过去在某些学校中虽然多少做了一些，但一般都是个别的，而且缺乏计划性。去年九月全国综合大学会议以后，各校才开始比较重视这个工作。
    不少高等学校的教师曾专门学习了全国综合大学会议的决议，进一步明确了科学研究工作的重要意义，并认识到和教学工作结合进行的科学研究工作，不仅能使自己的教学水平逐步提高，而且能解决国家建设中的某些实际问题。现在，科学研究的空气已在某些高等学校中出现。为了推动科学研究工作，山东大学和山东农学院组织了专门机构，统一领导这一工作。兰州大学、中山大学、中南财经学院等校，为提倡科学研究工作，举行了科学报告会或科学讨论会，大大地鼓舞了教师们学习苏联先进科学和进行科学研究的热情。中国人民大学由于学校领导方面的积极提倡及苏联专家的帮助，从一九五○年起逐步由局部到全面、由低到高地开展了科学研究工作，定期举行科学讨论会，并订出科学作业评选、奖励等办法。该校第三次科学讨论会中关于“东北机械三厂按图表组织有节奏生产的研究”的报告，曾引起各企业单位的重视。中央人民政府第一机械工业部领导方面认为，它能够解决工作中的实际问题。本学年全校参加科学研究的教师共有三百九十九人，研究专题三百三十一个。另外，东北人民大学自上学期起，也举行了四十二次科学报告会、座谈会，完成了十二个科学专题论文。
    现在，很多高等学校的教研组和教师，已根据具体情况提出了科学研究工作计划，一般围绕目前教学上迫切需要解决的问题着手研究；结合钻研苏联教材，搜集有关资料，以充实教材内容。例如兰州大学数学系教师在计划中要求大家钻研苏联教材，批判唯心思想；经济系教授吴宗汾则根据苏联恩·恩·廖佐夫的“统计学原理”的理论，研究我国的实际材料，准备按照学生的水平改编教材。有些学校心理、生物等系的教师，则学习巴甫洛夫或米丘林的先进科学理论。文科方面，一般以准备专业课、修改、讨论讲稿或编写教材作为科学研究工作的内容。北京大学中国哲学史教研室对先秦几个重要学派如孔子、老子、墨子、荀子和韩非子等作了专题讨论，研究了如何正确理解当时社会发展情况及运用正确的历史观点和阶级分析方法来分析批判古代哲学家的思想。
    有些学校的系科和教师，和科学研究机构，生产部门或行政领导部门建立了联系。如山东大学生物、海洋、水产、化学等系的教师和中国科学院海洋生物研究室、中央人民政府农业部、中央水产实验所和山东水产公司等单位合作，调查黄海、渤海区的鱼场。事实证明这种联系是必要的，对双方都有很大帮助。如中南矿冶学院选矿系一年来编了九本专业课的讲义，大部分材料都是有关部门及厂矿搜集来的。有的学校在这个基础上和厂矿或有关部门订立了技术合作联系合同。如东北工学院和沈阳冶炼厂在最近签订了一项合作合同，努力完成经双方共同商定的研究题目。在研究过程中，工厂方面应供给必要的研究材料、样品和设备等，并请生产革新者和工程技术人员为教师和学生做报告。学校方面则应结合工厂生产中的实际问题，向该厂干部、技术人员和工人作专题报告和解答；经常供给有关有色金属冶炼方面的新资料；协助工厂制订技工学校的教学计划，供给教学参考资料。现在，东北工学院冶金系有色冶炼组的教师，在苏联专家的帮助下，已选定题目开始进行研究。
    从各地学校的情况看来，不少教师对开展科学研究工作都采取积极的态度。有的教授说：“我们这头牛，如不好好吃草，奶就不够了。”但有少数教师认为教学任务很重，很难进行研究工作，其实只要处理得好，二者是相辅相成的。例如，南京农学院农学及土壤肥料等系教师，利用科学研究中所获得的资料，修改或充实了教材。中国人民大学工业经济系“工业经济”课程，过去只有“苏联工业部门的生产计划”，缺乏有关我国的教材。后来，该校教师金挥从实习和研究工作中搜集材料编写了教材。华东化工学院教师从研究中体验到：只有到厂里看一看、做一做，才能对原则的理论问题领会得更深刻。工程师和工人会帮助他们了解许多书本上没有的实际知识，使他们在确定专业教材的内容、重点及实验器材的设置等方面有所依据。该校施亚钧讲师过去觉得开专业课没把握，下厂实习后改变了这种认识。
