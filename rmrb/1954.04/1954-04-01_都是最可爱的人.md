All Are the Most Lovable People
　　Tang Changzhi
　　Ding Baozhu is a people's hero of the Xikang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who has been credited with meritorious service three times. After learning that Yi Caixue, a second-class hero and special-class meritorious person of the Volunteer Army, would be coming to the Kangzang Plateau with the Chinese People's Delegation to comfort the People's Liberation Army, he eagerly hoped to meet him. In the past, he always thought that meeting this hero was an unattainable ideal, because the hero was in Korea, while he lived in a remote border area. Now that the ideal is about to become a reality, how could he not be happy!
　　On the day Yi Caixue arrived in Ya'an, Ding Baozhu was both excited and agitated. He couldn't sleep that night, lying in bed thinking about what to say.
　　The next day, it happened to be Ding Baozhu's turn to be on duty. He was unable to meet Yi Caixue. On the third day, he participated in the entire comfort meeting, and again did not find an opportunity to talk with Yi Caixue. In the evening, he heard that Yi Caixue would be going to Changdu with the delegation tomorrow. Ding Baozhu was so anxious that he took gifts and rushed to the military region's guest house that night. But unfortunately, Yi Caixue was invited away by a group of students a few minutes before he arrived. After waiting for a long time, Yi Caixue still did not return. He became even more anxious, walking from upstairs to downstairs, and then from downstairs to upstairs; then he stood at the door again. At midnight, a receptionist advised him, "Come early tomorrow morning. Yi Caixue will not leave for Changdu until eight o'clock tomorrow!" "No, I will wait until dawn!" Ding Baozhu replied stubbornly.
　　After waiting for a while, Yi Caixue returned. The receptionist quickly greeted him and Yi Caixue to meet. This made Ding Baozhu extremely happy. He tightly grasped Yi Caixue's hand and said, "I finally got to see you!" Yi Caixue also warmly shook his hand and said excitedly, "Ah! Old Brother! Close comrade-in-arms!" Then, Ding Baozhu gave the two gifts he had prepared to Yi Caixue.
　　Yi Caixue took the gift and opened the red satin commemorative album. On it was written: "Presented to the most lovable person - Comrade Yi Caixue." He said excitedly, "Close comrade-in-arms, I know your heart. You are my dear elder brother. After I return to Korea, I must show your gift to all the comrades. I will also suggest that all the comrades in our company communicate with you. We will encourage each other and progress together."
　　Ding Baozhu replied, "We soldiers guarding the border of the motherland must also learn from your noble qualities of loyalty to the motherland, and we must learn from your great spirit of not fearing difficulties and sacrifices. We will always guard here, protect the construction of the motherland, and build the border area even more beautifully."
　　In an instant, they felt they understood each other better and were closer to each other. Yi Caixue seemed to feel that he and Ding Baozhu had not met for the first time, but were old comrades-in-arms for many years. He put his arm around Ding Baozhu and said, "Your encouragement to me is too great!"
　　"No, your encouragement to me is too great!" Ding Baozhu also hugged him tightly.
　　The next morning, Ding Baozhu came to see him off. When Yi Caixue jumped into the car, he tightly grasped Yi Caixue's hand and said, "Let us encourage each other and progress together in our posts of defending the motherland!" (Attached photo)

    都是最可爱的人
  　唐昌智
    丁宝珠是中国人民解放军西康军区的人民功臣，曾立过三次功。他看到志愿军二级英雄特等功臣易才学将随中国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到康藏高原上来的消息以后，就热望着能见到他。过去，他总以为和这个英雄见面是不可实现的理想，因为英雄身在朝鲜，而自己却住在僻远的边疆。现在，理想快成为现实，这怎么不叫他高兴呢！
    易才学到达雅安的那一天，丁宝珠又兴奋又激动。晚上，他怎么也睡不着觉。躺在床上思索着要说的话。
    第二天，恰巧轮到丁宝珠值班。他没有能碰到易才学。第三天他又整天参加了慰问大会，又没有找到和易才学谈话的机会。晚上，他听说易才学明天就要随代表团去昌都。丁宝珠急坏了，拿起礼品连夜赶往军区招待所。但事不凑巧，在他到达前几分钟，易才学被一群学生请走了。等了老半天，还不见易才学回来。他又急了，一会儿从楼上走到楼下，又从楼下走到楼上；一会儿他又站到门口去。等到深夜十二点钟，一个招待员劝他说：“明天清晨来吧。易才学要明天八点钟才动身去昌都呢！”“不，到天亮我也要等！”丁宝珠固执地回答着。
    等了好一会，易才学回来了。招待员连忙招呼他和易才学相见。这可把丁宝珠乐坏了。他紧紧地握住易才学的手说：“我可见到你了！”易才学也亲热地握着他的手激动地说：“啊！老大哥！亲密的战友！”接着，丁宝珠把准备好的两件礼品送给了易才学。
    易才学接过礼品，将那本红色缎面的纪念册翻开一看，上面写着：赠给最可爱的人——易才学同志。他激动地说：“亲密的战友，我知道你的心意了。你是我的亲哥哥。我回到朝鲜后，一定要把你的礼物给全体同志看，我还要建议我们全连的同志和你通信，我们互相鼓励，一同进步。”
    丁宝珠回答说：“我们守卫着祖国边疆的战士们，也一定要学习你们忠于祖国的高贵品质，要学习你们不怕困难牺牲的伟大精神。我们永远守卫在这里，保卫祖国的建设，将边疆建设得更美丽。”
    顷刻之间，他们觉得相互更加了解了，更加亲密了。易才学似乎觉得自己和丁宝珠不是初次见面，而是多年的老战友，他一把搂住丁宝珠说：“你对我的鼓励太大了！”
    “不，你对我的鼓励太大了！”丁宝珠也用劲搂住他。
    第二天清晨，丁宝珠赶来送行。当易才学跳上汽车的时候，他紧紧地握住易才学的手说：“让我们在保卫祖国的岗位上互相鼓励，互相进步吧！”（附图片）
