Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 28th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference held its second meeting on the 27th, chaired by V.M. Molotov.

    The foreign ministers began discussing the first item on the agenda—the Korean issue.

    Some newspapers reflected the concern of peace-loving people for the success of the Geneva Conference. They expressed satisfaction that the conference could immediately proceed with practical work and that attempts to obstruct the conference by creating disputes over procedural and organizational issues had failed. For example, the "Lausanne Gazette," when commenting on the agreement reached on the chairmanship issue due to the initiative of the Soviet delegation, praised this agreement as a "good start for the Geneva diplomatic conference despite pessimistic predictions."

    The peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, as decided at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, is the task of the Geneva Conference. The conference should seek ways to unify the Korean nation on a democratic basis. However, this is undoubtedly not within the plans of the South Korean government and its protectors.

    As everyone knows, certain aggressors have been engaging in provocative actions in the period before the Geneva Conference. In Seoul, there have been and still are cries to resume the Korean War, advocating a northward march to the Yalu River. The Seoul government is participating in the Geneva Conference on the condition of receiving "solemn assurances" from the United States of increased military aid to South Korea. Dulles pretended to be persuading the Seoul government to send representatives to Geneva, promising in his letter to Syngman Rhee on March 17th that if the Geneva Conference did not achieve success within three months, he would support Syngman Rhee's position. Syngman Rhee, in turn, shamelessly said that his government's representatives were going to Geneva merely to "prove that negotiations are futile."

    All these provocative activities conducted on the eve of the Geneva Conference illustrate that the sole purpose of the South Korean regime's representatives attending the Geneva Conference is to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement to peacefully unify Korea. This was confirmed by the speech of South Korean Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tae on the 27th. The South Korean representative was the first to speak during the discussion of the Korean issue on the 27th. In his speech, the South Korean representative gave an overview of the major events in Korea in recent years. This "overview," consistent with the spirit of American and Syngman Rhee's propaganda, blatantly distorted the actual situation. He attempted to shirk the responsibility of the South Korean government and the United States for the division of Korea and the responsibility of the United States for the aggression against Korea, and repeated stale slanders against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the democratic forces of the Korean people. He opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Korea who are using bayonets to support the Syngman Rhee regime. Unsurprisingly, he did not offer any suggestions that could slightly promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a democratic basis.

    Next, the chairman invited the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, to speak. Nam Il delivered a speech on the Korean issue and put forward concrete suggestions on restoring the national unification of Korea and holding free all-Korea elections.

    The next speaker was the representative of Colombia. He said that the Colombian delegation believes that the sole purpose of the Geneva Conference should be to reach an agreement on establishing a unified and independent Korea on a democratic basis by peaceful means. However, when talking about how to achieve this goal, the Colombian representative did not offer any suggestions, but only said that elections must be held throughout Korea under the supervision of the United Nations Korean Commission in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. As everyone knows, the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly were forced through by a majority that obeyed the orders of the United States. The Colombian representative made no mention of the fact that the above-mentioned resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly had been firmly condemned by the entire democratic public opinion of Korea, because elections held under foreign supervision and with foreign troops stationed in Korea could not be a means for the people to truly freely express their will.

    After the Colombian representative spoke, Chairman Molotov announced that the only speaker remaining on the registered list—the American representative—wished to postpone his speech until the next meeting. Therefore, Molotov suggested that the meeting be adjourned until then and that the discussion on the Korean issue be continued at the next meeting.

    This suggestion was accepted, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference will continue on the 28th.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Geneva Conference continued at 3 p.m. on the 27th, chaired by Molotov, the head of the Soviet delegation and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union.

    The representative of the Republic of Korea, Pyun Yung-tae, who spoke first, did not put forward any concrete suggestions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in his entire speech, but arbitrarily distorted and fabricated history, and wantonly slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. Thus, his speech was nothing more than a lengthy defamation. Pyun Yung-tae began by trying to conceal the illegality of the South Korean government. Pyun Yung-tae attempted to shift the responsibility for the war launched by the Syngman Rhee clique under the instigation of the United States onto the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Obviously, this denial does not change the well-known fact of the American aggression against Korea in the slightest. Although Pyun Yung-tae talked about "peace" and "independence" for Korea, he was afraid of losing the support of the American troops, he opposed the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, and at the same time unreasonably demanded that the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw first. Pyun Yung-tae wantonly slandered the peaceful foreign policy of China and the Soviet Union, and misrepresented China as an aggressor. Everyone knows that the United States occupied China's territory of Taiwan at the same time as launching the Korean War. The Chinese people have repeatedly advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Chinese people only organized the Chinese People's Volunteers to assist the Korean people in resisting foreign aggression and defending the security of their motherland when the American troops, ignoring the repeated warnings of the Chinese people, approached the Chinese border and threatened China's security. In concluding his slanderous long speech, Pyun Yung-tae complained that people blamed the Syngman Rhee clique for "liking war" and being "bellicose," and to the very end he still declared that South Korea "cannot buy peace." Thus, Pyun Yung-tae once again exposed the South Korean authorities' hostility and fear of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, then spoke (full text to be published separately). In stark contrast to Pyun Yung-tae's provocative speech, Nam Il thoroughly analyzed the essence of the Korean issue and put forward a concrete plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Next to speak was the representative of Colombia. He first declared that Colombia was not directly involved in the Korean issue, but he still put forward his views on the issue of rebuilding Korean unification. He advocated holding free elections in Korea to achieve the establishment of a unified and independent country in Korea. However, he did not offer any guarantees that this election could be truly free. He made no mention at all of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea as an indispensable condition for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and a prerequisite for holding free elections. On the contrary, he believed that this election must be held under the supervision of the United Nations and with the intervention of the illegal United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. As everyone knows, the side in the Korean War was the army under the name of the United Nations. Elections supervised by a belligerent party cannot be truly free elections.

    Chairman Molotov then announced that since the US Secretary of State Dulles, who had originally registered to speak on the 27th, had decided to postpone his speech until the 28th, and since no one else had registered to speak, the meeting on the 27th was adjourned.

    The next meeting will continue at 3 p.m. on the 28th.

### 日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题  南日提出恢复朝鲜统一的建议

    日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题
    南日提出恢复朝鲜统一的建议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社日内瓦二十八日讯：日内瓦外长会议在二十七日举行第二次会议，由维·米·莫洛托夫担任主席。
    外长们开始讨论第一项议程——朝鲜问题。
    有些报纸反映了爱好和平的公众关心日内瓦会议取得成功的情绪，它们对于会议能立即进行实际工作、对于在程序问题和有关组织的问题上制造争执以阻挠会议工作的企图已遭到失败，表示满意。例如，“洛桑日报”在谈到主席问题因苏联代表团的创议而达成协议时，称赞这个协议是“日内瓦外交会议尽管有悲观的预测而取得的良好开端”。
    和平解决朝鲜问题，正如柏林四国外长会议上所决定的，是日内瓦会议的任务。会议应该寻求在民主基础上使朝鲜国家统一的途径。可是，无疑的，这是不在南朝鲜政府和它的庇护人的打算之内的。
    大家知道，在日内瓦会议前的期间，某些侵略分子一直在采取挑衅手段。在汉城，曾经发出而且还在发出要恢复朝鲜战争的叫嚣，宣传向北进军直到鸭绿江边。汉城政府是在得到美国增加对南朝鲜的军事援助的“庄严保证”的条件下，才参加日内瓦会议的。杜勒斯装出好像是在劝说汉城政府派代表去日内瓦的样子，他在三月十七日致李承晚的信中答应，如果日内瓦会议在三个月之内不能取得成功，他便支持李承晚的态度。而李承晚呢，他无耻地说，他的政府的代表去日内瓦，仅仅是为了“证明谈判是无益的”。 
    在日内瓦会议前夕进行的这一切挑衅活动说明：南朝鲜政权的代表出席日内瓦会议的唯一目的，就是阻挠达成以和平方式统一朝鲜的协议。这一点在南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰二十七日的发言中，也可以得到肯定。卞荣泰在二十七日讨论朝鲜问题时首先发言。南朝鲜代表在发言中对近几年来的朝鲜大事作了一个概述。这一个和美国、李承晚的宣传精神一致的“概述”，露骨地歪曲了实际情况。他企图推卸南朝鲜政府和美国分裂朝鲜的责任、推卸美国侵略朝鲜的责任，并对苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜人民民主力量重复陈腐不堪的诬蔑。他反对从朝鲜撤退用刺刀来支持李承晚政权的美国军队。不出所料，他没有提出任何能稍稍促进在民主基础上和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    接着，主席请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日发言。南日就朝鲜问题发表演说，并提出了关于恢复朝鲜的国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的具体建议。
    下一个发言的是哥伦比亚代表。他说，哥伦比亚代表团认为，日内瓦会议的唯一目的应当是就用和平方式在民主基础上建立统一、独立的朝鲜的问题达成协议。但是，谈到怎样来达到这个目的时，哥伦比亚代表没有提出任何建议，只是说必须按照联合国大会的决议在联合国朝鲜委员会的监督下在全朝鲜举行选举，而大家知道，联合国大会的决议是顺从美国号令的多数所强迫通过的。哥伦比亚代表一点也没有提到，上述联合国大会的决议曾经遭到全朝鲜民主舆论的坚决斥责，因为在外国监督之下并在外国军队驻在朝鲜境内的情况下所举行的选举，不可能成为人民真正自由地表达自己意志的手段。
    哥伦比亚代表发言后，主席莫洛托夫宣布：在登记的名单上剩下的唯一发言人——美国代表，希望延至下次会议上发言。因此，莫洛托夫建议会议至此休会，在下次会议上再继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    大家接受了这一建议，外长会议将于二十八日继续举行。
    据新华社讯：日内瓦会议在二十七日下午三时继续举行，由苏联代表团首席代表苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫担任主席。
    首先发言的大韩民国的代表卞荣泰在他的全篇发言中没有提出任何和平解决朝鲜问题的具体建议，而只是任意歪曲并捏造历史，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联肆意诬蔑。这样，他的发言就不过是长篇的诽谤。卞荣泰一开始就竭力掩饰南朝鲜政府的非法性，卞荣泰企图把李承晚集团在美国唆使下发动战争的责任推在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国身上，显然这种抵赖丝毫改变不了众所周知的美国侵略朝鲜的事实。卞荣泰虽然谈到朝鲜的“和平”和“独立”，但是他唯恐失去美国军队的支持，他反对美国军队撤出朝鲜，同时又无理地要求中国人民志愿军首先撤退。卞荣泰肆意诬蔑中国和苏联的和平外交政策，并且颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国是侵略者。大家都知道，美国在发动朝鲜战争的同时侵占了中国的领土台湾。中国人民一再主张和平解决朝鲜问题。中国人民只是在美国军队不顾中国人民的一再警告，逼近中国国境，威胁中国安全的时候，才组织了中国人民志愿军去援助朝鲜人民，反抗外国侵略者，保卫自己祖国的安全。卞荣泰在结束其诽谤性的长篇发言时，抱怨人家责怪李承晚集团“喜欢战争”与“好斗成性”，而他直到最后还是扬言南朝鲜“不能购买和平”。这样，卞荣泰就又一次暴露了南朝鲜当局对朝鲜问题和平解决的敌意和恐惧。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表南日外务相接着发言（全文另发）。与卞荣泰的挑衅性发言完全相反，南日详尽地分析了朝鲜问题的实质，并且提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的具体方案。
    接着发言的是哥伦比亚代表。他首先宣称哥伦比亚对于朝鲜问题并非直接有关，但是他还是对重建朝鲜统一的问题提出了他的主张。他主张在朝鲜举行自由选举，以达到在朝鲜建立一个统一、独立的国家。但是，他没有提出任何保证，使这一选举能够是真正自由的。他完全没有提到外国军队撤离朝鲜，作为和平解决朝鲜问题的必不可少的条件，和举行自由选举的前提。相反地，他认为这一选举必须在联合国监督和在非法的联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的干预下举行。而大家知道，朝鲜战争的一方就是联合国名义下的军队。由交战的一方来监督进行的选举，不可能是真正自由选举的。
    主席莫洛托夫接着宣布：由于原来报名在二十七日发言的美国国务卿杜勒斯已决定将他的发言推迟到二十八日，同时又无别人报名发言，二十七日会议宣告休会。
    下次会议将于二十八日下午三时继续举行。
