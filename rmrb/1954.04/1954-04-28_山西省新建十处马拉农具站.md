Shanxi Province Builds Ten New Animal-Drawn Farm Implement Stations

    In order to improve agricultural production, the agricultural leadership organs of Shanxi Province have established ten animal-drawn farm implement stations in areas with relatively good mutual aid foundations throughout the province. Most of the animal-drawn farm implements at these stations have now been put into spring plowing production or are being tested locally. According to statistics from the Nan Shidian station in Jincheng County, the Dalu Village station in Xia County, and the Lujiazhuang station in Xin County, the single animal-drawn plow alone has cultivated nearly 400 mu of land for local agricultural producers' cooperatives. Farmers have realized the benefits of animal-drawn farm implements from practice and are actively requesting to join cooperatives. After the Xizhanggeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jie County tried animal-drawn farm implements, the number of cooperative members increased from 40 households to 351 households. Due to the further improvement of the class consciousness of the farmers after using animal-drawn farm implements, they realize that they must increase the production of grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials in order to industrialize the country and further develop agriculture. Therefore, some agricultural cooperatives have revised their plans that were not well integrated with the national plan. The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Datong County originally planned to plant 104 mu of spring wheat and 200 mu of flax. After using animal-drawn farm implements, they expanded the spring wheat to 200 mu and the flax to 1,000 mu, and made a plan to sell 30,000 jin of flax and 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. After using animal-drawn farm implements, the four agricultural cooperatives in Xiliang, Yicheng County, also expanded their cotton fields from the originally planned 700 mu to 1,000 mu.

    山西省新建十处马拉农具站
    山西省农业领导机关为了提高农业生产，特在全省互助基础较好的地方建立了十处马拉农具站，现在这些站的马拉农具已大部投入春耕生产或在当地进行试验。据晋城县南石店和夏县大吕村、忻县逯家庄等站统计，单马拉犁一项即给当地农业生产合作社代耕土地近四百亩。农民从实际中体会到马拉农具的好处，纷纷要求入社。解县西张耿农业生产合作社试用马拉农具后，社员已由四十户扩大到三百五十一户。由于农民使用马拉农具后，阶级觉悟有了进一步的提高，认识到必须多增产粮食、棉花和其他工业原料，才能使国家工业化，农业才能更发展，所以有些农业社原来订的计划没有和国家的计划结合好，又重新修订了他们的计划。大同县陈家庄农业社原来计划种春麦一百零四亩，葫麻二百亩，使用马拉农具后，他们就把春麦扩大到二百亩，把葫麻扩大到一千亩，并订出计划要卖给国家三万斤葫麻和三十万斤余粮。翼城县西梁四个农业社经过使用马拉农具后也由原来计划种七百亩棉田扩大到一千亩。
