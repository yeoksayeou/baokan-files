Reader's Letters Summary:

    Overlapping Institutions Should Be Merged
    Readers Li Zhongqi and Yang Linsheng write: The Anqing Prefectural Grain Bureau and the Anqing Municipal Grain Company in Anhui Province both have directly affiliated warehouses and processing plants in Anqing city and both directly engage in business. The Municipal Grain Company and its affiliated warehouses and processing plants have a total of more than 160 employees, while the Prefectural Grain Bureau's directly affiliated warehouses and processing plants have more than 70 employees. They have no division of labor in their business, and currently more than 30 percent of the personnel in both units have nothing to do. This has resulted in overlapping institutions, wasting a lot of manpower and financial resources. Due to the overlapping of institutions and the lack of coordination in work, the work has suffered a lot of losses. For example, in the allocation of processing tasks to private merchants, the directly affiliated warehouse of the Prefectural Grain Bureau sometimes does not go through the Municipal Processing Committee, nor does it contact the Municipal Grain Company, but directly contacts the private merchants for processing. This not only disrupts the processing plan and steps of the Municipal Grain Company, but also gives private merchants the opportunity to exploit loopholes due to the lack of unified standards.
    Since the First National Grain Work Conference, the directly affiliated warehouse of the Anqing Prefectural Grain Bureau and the Municipal Grain Company were once merged, but they were separated again soon after. We have reported this issue to the Provincial Grain Department, but it has not been resolved. We request the Grain Department of the Anhui Provincial People's Government to promptly address this issue.
      Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from Comrades Li Zhongqi and Yang Linsheng, we contacted the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government.
  The Ministry of Food believes that the readers' opinions are correct and has urged the Food Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee and the Food Department of the Anhui Provincial People's Government to promptly address this issue. Streamlining institutions and cutting administrative expenses are of great significance for ensuring the accumulation of national construction funds and overcoming bureaucracy. At present, the situation of waste and impact on work caused by overlapping institutions is not an isolated case, and all localities should pay attention to it and correct it.

### 应该合并重叠的机构

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该合并重叠的机构
    读者李忠琦、杨林生来信：安徽省安庆专署粮食局和安庆市粮食公司都在安庆市内设有直属仓库和加工厂，并且都直接经营业务。市粮食公司及所属仓库、加工厂共有职工一百六十多人，专署粮食局直属仓库和加工厂又有职工七十多人，彼此业务上又无分工，目前两个单位都有百分之三十以上的人没事可做。这就造成了机构重叠，浪费了不少的人力、财力。由于机构重叠，工作互不联系，使工作遭受了不少损失。如在分配私商加工任务方面，专署粮食局直属仓库有时不通过市加工委员会，也不与市粮食公司取得联系，就直接与私商接洽加工。这样不仅打乱了市粮食公司的加工计划和步骤，而且也因掌握加工标准不统一而给私商钻空子的机会。
    自第一次全国粮食工作会议以后，安庆专署粮食局直属仓库曾和市粮食公司合并，但不久又分开了。我们曾将这个问题向省粮食厅反映，结果也未得到解决。我们要求安徽省人民政府粮食厅迅速处理这个问题。
      编者按：我们接到李忠琦、杨林生二同志
  的来信以后，曾和中央人民政府粮食部联系。
  粮食部认为读者的意见是正确的，并已督促华
  东行政委员会粮食局及安徽省人民政府粮食
  厅迅速处理这个问题。精简机构，紧缩行政开支，对保证国家建设资金的积累和克服官僚主义有很重要的意义。而目前因机构重叠而造成浪费和影响工作的情况还不是个别的，各地应引起注意，加以纠正。
