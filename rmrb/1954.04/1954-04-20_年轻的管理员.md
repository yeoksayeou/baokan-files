    The Young Administrator
    By Our Correspondent Shen Shi
    
    The story begins when the tunnel engineering team first moved onto the Wushaoling Mountains.

    It was late at night, and two people were still talking in a tent halfway up the mountain.
    
    "Administrator! Are you aware of the situation in the team? Up here on the high mountains, the weather is cold and then hot. The workers aren't used to it yet, and some have fallen ill. The tunnel is about to be started, and if this continues, the project will be affected."
    
    "Instructor! I heard about these problems when I first came to Wushaoling, and I've been thinking about it too."
    
    "Yes, isn't everyone on the engineering team thinking about this problem? You and the doctor need to put in extra effort to help the sick recover as soon as possible," the instructor said.
    
    Instructor Wang Fuchang's words were deeply etched in Administrator Zhang Jingming's mind. He returned to his tent, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. One moment, the future tunnel appeared before him, as if saying, "Zhang Jingming! You also have a responsibility for the early completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway through Wushaoling!" The next moment, his thoughts turned to the mess hall. The newly built mess hall, made of reed mats, had no firewood, no vegetables. If this continued, would the workers have to drink plain boiled water with steamed buns for every meal? Although the conditions here aren't as good as at Qu'ercha on the Tianlan Line, even if we can't buy vegetables or firewood, there are always people living around here. As long as we travel a bit further, we can definitely buy things.

    Early in the morning, Zhang Jingming went down the mountain to Lanquan Gully, five kilometers from Wushaoling, and met an old villager named Wang Hongjun. Seeing him in railway worker's clothing, Wang Hongjun greeted him: "Comrade, what brings you to our mountain valley?"
    
    "Old fellow, we're on Wushaoling, and we can't buy firewood or vegetables. I'm here today to ask for your help."

    "Comrade, of course you can't buy anything on the mountain. As long as you come down the mountain, we won't let you come for nothing."
    
    Wang Hongjun led him to Fengjia Village in Sanggou Terrace and found the village chief. The village chief was a Tibetan, and he was overjoyed to hear that he was from the railway. He busily invited them into his house and brought out butter tea. They chatted while drinking tea.
    
    The village chief said, "I heard a long time ago that a railway was going to be built in Wushaoling. Building a railway, running trains, our minority people never even dreamed of it! To think that only four years after liberation, a railway is being built in our Tianzhu Autonomous Region."

    "Village Chief!" Zhang Jingming said, "Building the railway is just the beginning of construction in this area. Just speaking about the railway, with it, the products of this area can be transported to other places, and products from other places can be transported here. It will be very useful for the development of fraternal minority areas in the future!"
    
    "Comrade! I understand some of these principles too. Didn't you see us often riding our horses hundreds of miles to see the construction of the Jinqi River Railway Bridge? Didn't you hear that when the railway was being built in our autonomous region, we organized labor teams to help build the road? We eagerly盼望the railway to be built as soon as possible, and we also eagerly盼望to be able to take a train in the Tianzhu Autonomous Region as soon as possible!"
    
    The village chief became more and more enthusiastic. Wang Hongjun told him, "The tunnel engineering team is short of firewood and vegetables. They can't be bought on Wushaoling. Comrade Zhang is here today to ask you to think of a solution."

    "Firewood?" the village chief said. "We have plenty of firewood in Sanggou Terrace. I'll solve it for you." He consulted with the people in the village and ordered 200,000 catties for Zhang Jingming. Before Zhang Jingming left, the village chief also told him where to buy eggs.
    
    The next day, Zhang Jingming went to Shuanma River. This is an agricultural area, and every Tibetan resident raises chickens. Hearing that the railway workers had no vegetables to eat, they were all willing to sell them eggs.
    
    With firewood and eggs, Zhang Jingming gathered the cooks and said to them, "The climate on Wushaoling is abnormal, and the air is thin. Some of the workers are sick and don't like to eat dry food. Let's cook some egg drop soup and noodles for every meal. They'll definitely be happy to eat them." The cooks all agreed. Sure enough, after medical treatment and eating nutritious food, the workers' health recovered.

    One evening, Zhang Jingming calculated the food bill. He thought: always eating eggs costs a lot of money. Didn't the villagers say that there are many cattle and sheep in the Tibetan areas? Why not inquire about it?

    He went to Fengjia Village again and found the village chief. The village chief told him where to buy cattle and sheep and also told him about some Tibetan customs.
    
    When he returned from Fengjia Village, he said to the cooks, "I've calculated the food bill, and we can't keep eating eggs all the time!"

    "Why not? Isn't everyone fond of them? Besides, we can't buy anything else in this place," the cook said.

    "Everyone's fondness is one thing, but exceeding the monthly food budget is another. Think about it: there are many temporary workers in our team. They don't earn much each month, and their food expenses take up half of it. They still have wives and children! Yesterday, I inquired at Fengjia Village and learned that Tibetan families have many cattle and sheep. If we buy some cattle and sheep, the workers will have beef and mutton, and the food expenses will be reduced. They will definitely be satisfied."

    The cooks all agreed. Zhang Jingming also told the squad leader and instructor about the plan to improve the food. They both supported him.

    In June, on the grasslands of the Tianzhu Autonomous Region, the grass was growing lush and green. Zhang Jingming, along with cooks Zhang Xisan and Wang Jiu'an, took advantage of the good weather and set off for the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas inhabited by Tibetans. They talked as they walked. Zhang Jingming said, "Have you been to places like this before?"

    "No, this is my first time!" Zhang Xisan said.
    
    "Since it's our first time in a place like this, we should pay attention. These are all Tibetan residents. We must respect their customs and religious beliefs, and we can't be careless at all." On the way, Zhang Jingming also talked about some Tibetan customs and told them to remember them well.
    
    That day, they traveled eighty li and arrived at the ninth village of Yongfeng Township. They found the village chief, who could speak a few words of Chinese. When he learned that they were railway workers and had come from Wushaoling, he warmly welcomed them and brought out butter tea, zanba, and milk tea to entertain them. Zhang Jingming explained their purpose, and the village chief said, "Cattle and sheep can be bought here, but they have all been driven to a place thirty li away. Why don't you stay at my house and leave tomorrow?"
    
    That night, they stayed at the village chief's house. When it was time to sleep, there was already a woman lying on the kang. The three men went to sleep without taking off their clothes.

    After chanting scriptures, the village chief walked to the kang and saw that they were all facing away from his daughter, so he quietly went out.

    The next morning, they prepared to go to the place where the cattle and sheep were. The village chief said, "Comrades, why are you in such a hurry? Have some morning tea before you leave!" They stayed and had tea with the village chief's family. Just as they were drinking tea, the village chief told his daughter to saddle up three good horses in the house. After drinking tea, they prepared to set off, but the village chief's daughter brought the horses. The village chief said, "Comrades! You were tired yesterday. Today, everyone should ride a horse, and it will be faster." The three men declined for a while, but the village chief said, "Coming to our place means you're part of the family, so there's no need to be so polite!"

    Before leaving, the village chief shook Zhang Jingming's hand tightly and said to them, "You are truly people sent by Chairman Mao. You even paid attention to our customs when sleeping. How can we not be moved?"
    
    Zhang Jingming established a good relationship with this village chief. Later, he often went to this area to buy cattle and sheep. The village chief sometimes went to Wushaoling to visit Zhang Jingming. Zhang Jingming showed him around the tunnel project and even returned the sheepskin he had tanned well.
    
    The workers often ate beef and mutton, and the monthly food expenses were not high. Everyone was satisfied. Especially the temporary workers, when they saw Zhang Jingming, said, "Administrator! You really think about us in a thoughtful and meticulous way."

    Zhang Jingming has been on the railway for four years. In those four years, his jobs have been: cook, mess hall manager, and administrator.
    
    When he was still a cook, someone said, "Jingming! You're young and you're better than others at everything you do. Why are you a cook?"
    
    After he became an administrator, someone said, "Some of the people who came with you have become squad leaders. Look at you, still just a cook leader."

    Whenever he heard such words, he always said calmly, "Comrades! Don't look down on cooks! The work of cooks and mess hall managers is all for the railway. Constantly caring about the workers' health, so that they are full of energy when they work, isn't the tunnel able to be opened sooner? Isn't the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway able to be extended westward earlier?"

    In April, the southern regions of the motherland are in full bloom, but on Wushaoling, three thousand meters above sea level, snow still sometimes falls from the sky. Our young administrator, this tireless Communist Youth League member, will be going to the pastoral areas again in a few days. As he steps on the tender grass that has sprouted, thinking of the strong and sturdy worker brothers who have already pierced through the heart of Wushaoling (the tunnel's pilot tunnel), thinking that in the near future, the trains on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway will follow the winding railway, climb over the high mountains, pass through the tunnel, and advance towards the rich Hexi Corridor, he will forget the fatigue of the journey. He knows that he has contributed his share to the railway construction of the motherland.

    年轻的管理员
    本报记者　沈石
    事情的开始，是在隧道工程队刚搬上乌鞘岭的时候。
    夜，已经很深了，山腰的帐篷里，有两个人还在谈话。
    “管理员！你知道队上的情形吗？高山上，时冷时热，工人初到这里，没有住惯，有的病倒了，眼看隧道就要动工，这样下去，工程会受影响的。”
    “指导员！前两天，我来乌鞘岭，就听说过这些情形了，我也在想这个问题。”
    “是的，工程队的人，那个不想这一问题？要想生病的人，早日恢复健康，你和医生都得加一把劲。”指导员说。
    指导员王福昌的话，深深地刻在管理员张景明的心里。他回到自己的帐篷，翻来复去，老是睡不着。一会儿，那未来的隧道出现在他的面前了，好像它在说：“张景明！兰新路早日修过乌鞘岭，你也有一份责任啊！”一会儿，他的思想又转到伙房去了。那用芦席新搭好的伙房，没有烧柴，没有菜蔬，这样下去，难道每顿饭，都让工人喝白开水加馒头吗？这儿的条件，虽然还赶不上天兰线上的曲儿岔，虽然买不到菜蔬烧柴，可是周围总有人家，只要多跑些路，一定可以买到东西的。
    清早，张景明下了山，走到离乌鞘岭五公里的兰泉沟，碰见一位名叫王洪君的老乡，王洪君看他穿着铁路工人的服装，就向他打招呼：“同志，跑到我们山沟里来干什么呢？”
    “老乡，我们在乌鞘岭上，买不到柴和菜。我今天来这里，就是请你们帮忙的。”
    “同志，你们在山上，当然买不到东西，只要你下了山，总不会让你白跑一趟的。”
    王洪君把他引到三沟台冯家庄，找着了村长。村长是个藏民，一听说他是铁路上的人，高兴的了不得，忙着请他们到自己的房里，拿出酥油茶，他们边喝茶边谈话。
    村长说：“早就听说要在乌鞘岭修铁路了，修铁路，走火车，我们少数民族人民真是做梦也没有想到啊！想不到，解放还只四年，就在我们天祝自治区修起铁路来了。”
    “村长！”张景明说：“修铁路，只是这个地区的建设刚刚开始，仅仅就铁路来说，有了它，这里出产的东西，可以运到外地去，外地的东西，可以运到这里来。将来对发展兄弟民族地区可有作用哩！”
    “同志！这些道理我也懂得一些，你没有见到修金?河铁桥时，我们经常骑着马，跑百几十里路，到那里去看了又看吗？你没有听到铁路修到我们自治区时，我们组织民工队帮助修路吗？我们眼巴巴地盼望铁路早早修过来，也眼巴巴地盼望早一天能够在天祝自治区搭上火车哩！”
    村长越谈越有劲，王洪君告诉他：“隧道工程队缺少烧柴菜蔬，乌鞘岭上买不到，张同志今天来这里，要请你想办法。”
  “烧柴吗？”村长说：“我们三沟台有的是柴，我给你们解决。”他找村上的人商量，给张景明订购了二十万斤。张景明临走时，村长还告诉他哪里可买到鸡蛋。
    第二天，张景明到了拴马河。这里是农业区，藏族居民家家都养鸡。他们听到铁路工人没有菜吃，都愿意卖鸡蛋给他们。
    有了柴，有了鸡蛋，张景明把炊事员们找来，对他们说：“乌鞘岭气候不正常，空气稀薄，有的工人有病，不爱吃干的东西，我们每顿煮些鸡蛋汤，做些面条，他们一定欢喜吃。”炊事员都赞成。果然，病人经过医疗，再加上吃了有营养的食品，健康都恢复过来了。
    一个晚上，张景明算了算伙食账，他想：老是吃鸡蛋，工人伙食费花的多，老乡不是说过藏民地区牛羊多吗？为什么不去打听一下呢？
    他又到了冯家庄，找着了村长。村长告诉他哪里可买到牛羊，还讲了一些藏族的风俗习惯。
    他从冯家庄回来，对炊事员说：“我算了一下伙食账，老是吃鸡蛋不行哩！”
    “为什么不行？大家不是爱吃吗？再说这地方又买不到别的东西。”炊事员说。
    “大家爱吃是一回事，每月的伙食费要超过，是另一回事。你们想一想：我们队上临时工多，临时工每月挣的不多，他们的伙食费要占去一半，他们还有老婆娃娃哩！昨天，我到冯家庄打听了，知道藏胞家里牛羊多，如果我们买上些牛羊，工人吃到牛羊肉，伙食费又减少了，他们一定满意。”
    炊事员都赞成。张景明又将改善伙食的办法告诉分队长和教导员。他们都支持他。
  六月里，天祝自治区的草原上，草儿长的青青的，张景明带着炊事员张喜三和王九安，趁着好天气，向藏民聚居的半农半牧区进发了。他们边走边谈。张景明说：“你们过去到过这样的地方吗？”
    “没有，这还是第一次哩！”张喜三说。
    “既然是初次到这样的地方，我们应该注意。这里住的都是藏民，我们一定要尊重他们的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，一点也马虎不得。”在路上，张景明还说了一些藏民的风俗习惯，告诉他们应该牢牢地记住。
    这一天，他们走了八十里，到了永丰乡第九村，找到了村长，村长会说几句汉话，当他知道他们是铁路工人，又是从乌鞘岭来的，热情地欢迎他们，拿出酥油、糌粑和奶茶来款待。张景明说明了来意，村长说：“这里是可以买到牛羊的，不过，牛羊都赶到三十里路以外的地方去了，你们还是在我家住下来，明天再走吧？”
    这天晚上，他们歇宿在村长的家里。睡觉的时候，炕上已经躺了一个女人。三个人，衣服也没脱就睡起来。
    村长念完了经，走到炕旁，看到他们都是背对着自己的女儿，便悄悄地走出去了。
    第二天的早上，他们准备动身到有牛羊的地方去。村长说：“同志们，为什么这样急急忙忙的呢？还是喝了早茶再走吧！”他们留下来，和村长一家人一道喝茶。就在喝茶的时候，村长叫他的女儿，将家里的三匹好马备上了马鞍。喝过茶，他们准备启程，想不到村长的女儿将马牵来了。村长说：“同志们！你们昨天辛苦了，今天，大家都骑上马，赶起路来也快些。”三个人推辞了一阵，村长说：“到我们这里来，就是一家人，用不着客套呵！”
    临行前，村长紧紧地握着张景明的手，对他们说：“你们真是毛主席派来的人，连睡觉都注意到我们的风俗习惯，怎叫我们全家不感动呢？”
    张景明和这个村长建立了感情，以后，他经常到这一带去买牛羊。村长有时也去乌鞘岭看望张景明，张景明引他参观隧道工程，还将羊皮晒得好好的退还给他。
    工人们经常吃到牛羊肉，每月的伙食费支出的不多，大家都满意。特别是临时工，见了张景明，就说：“管理员！你真替我们想得周到细致。”
    张景明，他到铁路上，已经四个年头了。四个年头，他的工作：炊事员，伙食长，管理员。
    还是他当炊事员的时候，有人说：“景明！你年纪轻轻的，干什么都比别人强，为什么当个炊事员呢？”
    他做了管理员，有人说：“人家和你一道来的，有的当了分队长，看你，还是个炊事员头头。”
    每当他听这样的话，总是心平气和地说：“同志！你不要瞧不起炊事员哩！炊事员，伙食长，他们的工作，还不是为了铁路。经常关心工人的健康，让他们干起活来，满身都是劲，隧道不是可以早日打通吗？兰新路不是可以提前向西修吗？”
    四月，祖国的江南，正是春暖花开的时候，但在拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭，有时天空仍然飘起雪花，我们年轻的管理员，这位不知劳倦的青年团员，过几天，他又要到牧区去了。当他踏着那发出嫩芽的浅草，想到那些身强力壮的工人弟兄，已经打穿了乌鞘岭的心脏（隧道的导坑），想到不久的将来，兰新路上的火车，将循着蜿蜒的铁路，爬过高山，通过隧道，向那富饶的河西走廊前进，他会忘却旅途的疲劳，他知道他在祖国的铁路建设里，贡献了自己的一份力量。
