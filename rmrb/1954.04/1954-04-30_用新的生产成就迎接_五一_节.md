Greet the "May Day" Festival with New Production Achievements

Six Factories in Beijing Complete Plans Ahead of Schedule

The workers of the capital are continuously greeting the "May Day" International Labor Day with new production achievements. As of April 28th, the state-owned North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, and the locally state-owned Beijing Enamel Factory, Beijing Flour Mill, Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Beijing Tap Water Company have all completed their national production plans for April ahead of schedule. In the State-owned Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the axle box professional chemical section of the locomotive workshop, and the guide plate crosshead, connecting rocker, and valve movement sections of the mechanical workshop completed their national plans for April twelve to sixteen days ahead of schedule. In the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the Shi Juncai casting team successfully changed to the "split box molding method" to make guard knife holders in the competition with their counterparts from brother factories, increasing work efficiency by nearly doubled, thus completing the April task ten days ahead of schedule. The No. 7 production team of the Chengzi Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau adopted the advanced experience of mixed operations and the implementation of regular cyclic operations, completing the national plan for April eleven days ahead of schedule. Fangshan Coal Mine workers Wang Tieshuan and electrical and mechanical worker Yang Zuodong cooperated to create a drilling machine, which greatly improved work efficiency. In the past, three people jointly held a wind drill to make holes, but now three people can operate five wind drills at the same time. Gui Yupeng, a young lathe operator in the State-owned Beijing People's Machinery Factory, improved operations four times in a row, completing the work-hour quota for the first ten days of April in just three days, and completed the entire month's production plan on April 15th.

At present, the city's workers are continuing to create newer production achievements. The workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, which has completed the national plan for April, plan to overfulfill the plan by increasing production by 100 harvesters, 6,000 No. 20 walking plows, and 1,000 weeding hoes in the second quarter. Workers at the Beijing People's Machinery Factory guarantee to increase production and save 10 billion yuan in the second quarter, and will successfully trial-produce a 30-ton meter-type gantry crane on the eve of the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Actively Help the Korean People Repair Vehicles

The workers of the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, in the competition to greet the "May Day" festival, have highly developed the spirit of internationalism and actively helped the Korean people repair locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars.

A batch of steel, blue-green skinned, and milky-yellow carriage passenger cars and sturdy freight cars repaired by the factory's workers for the Korean people in the first quarter have been delivered to the Korean people on April 9th and 21st respectively. In the second quarter, the factory accepted the glorious task of repairing another batch of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars for the Korean people. Recently, when these vehicles to be repaired were pulled into the yard for work, the workers felt very excited, and each team formulated a competition plan. In the competition, workers continuously improved technology, improved production efficiency, and improved the quality of vehicle repairs. Each process guarantees that unqualified parts are not passed on to the next process. All processes have strengthened the intermediate inspection system. Workers are very careful when conducting intermediate inspections. Workers who make passenger car skins use a flat ruler of more than five feet long to check the plane to prevent unevenness, and consult the product inspector's opinion while self-inspecting, without any carelessness. Workers Li Guoxing and Jiang Guangqi improved their operation methods when making passenger car side doors, shortening working hours.

Daye Steel Plant Completes Main Product Plan Ahead of Schedule

The workers of the state-owned Central China Iron and Steel Company's Daye Steel Plant greeted the "May Day" International Labor Day with actions to complete the national plan for April ahead of schedule. As of April 27th, high-quality rolled steel, high-quality forged steel, ordinary rolled steel, electric furnace steel ingots, and Bessemer furnace steel ingots, among the factory's main products, have all achieved the national plan for April ahead of schedule, and the product quality has reached the standards stipulated by the state. Among them, high-quality rolled steel achieved the plan eight days and eight hours ahead of schedule, and 99.96% of the products met the specifications. (Xinhua News Agency)

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Makes Achievements in Technological Innovation

In mid-April, the workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant greeted the "May Day" International Labor Day with many new achievements in technological innovation.

Technician Li Chunyuan and workers Xue Shengwen and Li Jintang of the Steelmaking Department put forward a suggestion for the mechanization of steelmaking furnace feeding. On April 26th, two electric cars for feeding have been manufactured, and electromagnetic iron suction cups and belt conveyors are also being installed. After these devices are completed, the feeding work can be completely mechanized. More than 30,000 workdays can be saved throughout the year. The Xin'an mechanical feeding equipment will hold a grand commissioning ceremony on "May Day."

The Small Rolling Mill Department of the factory began manufacturing and installing anti-retaining discs, automatic steel roller transportation, and steel press-out machines in April. It is expected that after completion in late May, labor efficiency will be increased by two to three times, and personnel can be reduced by 60%.

In addition, Liu Linhu, the machine repair foreman of the Coking Department, created a wind drill expansion eye device, which increased production efficiency by 16 times. The gas leakage phenomenon of the old-fashioned gas generators used by the steelmaking department has been a serious problem for a long time, and people often faint from poisoning in front of the furnace every year. Foreman Ma Shoujin put forward an important suggestion for reforming the old furnace, and reform is currently underway. After the reform is completed, the gas leakage situation will be completely changed. Guo Mingcai, a coal loading worker in the Coking Department, proposed installing an automatic coal mixing machine in front of the coking furnace. This equipment is now being installed, and after completion, the coal loading workers will no longer operate in the yellow smoke and high temperature.

April was a month in which the factory's workers proposed an unprecedented number of technical innovation suggestions. Preliminary statistics show that there are 150 major suggestions, which have greatly contributed to increasing production, reducing costs, and improving labor conditions.

Angang No. 6 Blast Furnace Reconstruction

The reconstruction project of another modern blast furnace in my country - the No. 6 Blast Furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company - has begun on a large scale. Now, from the towering furnace top to the ground, every corner is filled with construction workers. With the experience of reconstructing the No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnaces, the reconstruction project of this blast furnace is progressing rapidly after it started. The foundation reinforcement project of the furnace body has been successfully completed. After the hearth equipment arrives for installation, bricklaying can begin. The reinforcement project of the winch room has also been completed, and the winch foundation is now being poured in preparation for installing the winch. The heightening and reinforcement project of the hot blast stove has also been basically completed, and some hot blast stoves have begun bricklaying.

To greet this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, the workers participating in the construction of this blast furnace launched a warm labor competition. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the workers overcame many difficulties in construction. Technicians Jiang Zhongxian, Xiong Dashou, and more than a dozen workers created a small-scale gunpowder blasting method in clearing more than 200 tons of scrap iron, completing the task ahead of schedule and saving 500 workdays. Soviet expert Kryukov put forward three suggestions in the furnace body foundation reinforcement project. After the workers earnestly implemented them, the quality of the furnace body foundation was fully guaranteed, creating favorable conditions for large-scale construction.

Railway Construction Workers Enthusiastically Launch Competition

The workers constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway enthusiastically launched a labor competition to greet "May Day."

More than 100 teams and more than 60,000 workers participated in the competition on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway; many management departments and affiliated factory workers also participated in the competition. In the competition, the workers actively learned Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, put forward rationalization proposals for improving production, and created many new production records. Luo Yaogui, a young worker from the Jialing River Bridge Team, created a "medicine package pressure blasting method," which increased work efficiency by 50 times. When erecting the No. 2 Shuimo River Bridge, the workers of the nailing track and bridge team created the latest record of erecting four T-beams in four hours and fifty minutes.

Workers who built the No. 2 Gulang River Bridge on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway adopted the "prefabricated bridge pier model installation method" to install the bridge pier model, which increased work efficiency by 15 times. Zhang Guangbin, a 70-year-old foreman, put forward a rationalization proposal, saving more than 100 cubic meters of wood, more than 3,000 screws, and more than 1,000 man-hours for scaffolding. They also challenged other construction sites with conditions such as completing the bridge one month ahead of schedule and saving 1 billion yuan in construction costs. Since the launch of the labor competition, the workers have opened up the Longgou No. 5 tunnel ten days ahead of schedule. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
