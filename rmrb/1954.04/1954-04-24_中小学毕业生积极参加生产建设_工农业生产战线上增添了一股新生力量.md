    Primary and Secondary School Graduates Actively Participate in Production and Construction
    A New Force Added to the Industrial and Agricultural Production Fronts

    [Reported by our newspaper] In recent years, especially since the gradual strengthening of labor education for primary and secondary school students in various regions last year, a large number of senior primary school graduates and junior high school graduates across the country have participated in production and construction work. This group of students has become a new force on the industrial and agricultural production fronts.

    Over the past four years, East China has trained more than 1.83 million senior primary school graduates, of which nearly half have participated in production and construction work; most of the rural senior primary school graduates have participated in agricultural production. In Northeast China last year, about 10,000 junior high school graduates went to work in industrial departments such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Harbin Flax Factory; at the same time, more than 140,000 senior primary school graduates participated in agricultural production. In Inner Mongolia, more than 1,400 senior primary school graduates from counties such as Kailu, Tongliao, and Tuquan participated in the agricultural production front last year. In other regions, hundreds and thousands of senior primary school graduates and junior high school graduates have also happily joined production and construction work.

    These educated youths have certain cultural and scientific knowledge and political awareness, learn production techniques quickly, and are also easily receptive to new things. Many people have already played a significant role in production and construction. Junior high school graduates who went to work at the technical inspection station of the ore dressing plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company last September have basically mastered inspection techniques after a short period of study and are now gradually being transferred to more important positions. Zhu Lu, a senior primary school graduate who went to work as a plumber in a state-owned factory in Harbin last year, has mastered the general techniques of plumbing due to his active work and diligent learning and is often praised at workshop meetings; at the same time, because he takes good care of tools, he has also been elected by workers as the tool custodian of the workshop. Many students participating in industrial production also serve as teachers in workers' spare-time schools and assist factories in carrying out recreational and sports activities. Junior high school graduates and senior primary school graduates participating in agricultural production have shown an even greater role. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, has 34 senior primary school graduates, five of whom were sent to tractor stations to learn how to drive tractors, two to learn how to dig wells, one to study at the maternal and child health station, two to become accountants, two to become agricultural technicians, one to become the deputy director of the cooperative, and the others to become work recorders, civil school teachers, and women's production team leaders, etc. Last autumn, Yushu Village in Xifeng County, Liaodong Province, organized 25 senior primary school graduates to learn new techniques for raising livestock and basic knowledge about animal and poultry disease prevention and breeding. Last year, they helped the whole village build 62 new-style pigsties and 11 stables and cowsheds, and under the guidance of animal husbandry technical cadres in the county, they carried out swine fever prevention injections and livestock prevention injections in the village and helped neighboring villages. The fourteen senior primary school graduates from Zhaotun Village, Dachengzhuang Township, 11th District, Feng County, Jiangsu Province, promoted the establishment of 15 mutual aid teams in the village, and many people served as leaders and work recorders of the mutual aid teams.

    Primary and secondary school graduates participating in production and construction are generally valued and welcomed. Many factories have also set up technician training classes for them. Many veteran workers have signed apprenticeship contracts with them, enthusiastically teaching them production techniques. Farmers in various places warmly welcome this group of educated youths. Some elderly farmers said, "In the future, we will use tractors in the countryside, but we old folks don't even recognize the number codes, how can we use them? It's great that students are participating in production now!" Primary and secondary school graduates who are doing well in production and work are actively elected by the masses as cadres and model workers. Li Enfeng, a senior primary school graduate from Aohan Banner, Rehe Province, was awarded the title of model worker and received a reward from the Rehe Provincial People's Government for leading the women of the village to do a good job in production. Cai Keji, an 18-year-old senior primary school graduate from Caijia Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, was elected as the deputy village chief due to his good labor and active work. Lu Genze, a junior high school graduate from Hailan Village, Yanji County, Jilin Province, secretary of the village branch of the Communist Youth League, and deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative, Xu Jianchun, a senior primary school graduate from Houlu Village, Yexian County, Shandong Province, and director of the agricultural production cooperative, and Guo Tongxu, a senior primary school graduate from Nanguo Village, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, and deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative, have all become figures loved by the local masses.

    中小学毕业生积极参加生产建设
    工农业生产战线上增添了一股新生力量
    【本报讯】最近几年来，特别是去年各地逐步加强了对中、小学生的劳动教育以后，全国各地已有大批高小毕业生和初中毕业生参加生产建设工作。这批学生成了工农业生产战线上的一股新生力量。
    华东全区四年多来培养了一百八十三万多名高小毕业生，其中将近半数参加了生产建设工作；农村高小毕业生大部分参加了农业生产。东北区去年约有一万名初中毕业生到鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂和哈尔滨亚麻厂等工业部门工作；同时有十四万多名高小毕业生参加了农业生产。内蒙古开鲁、通辽、突泉等县去年有一千四百多名高小毕业生参加到农业生产战线上去。其他地区也有成百成千的高小毕业生和初中毕业生愉快地投入生产建设工作。
    这些知识青年有一定的文化科学知识和政治觉悟，学习生产技术较快，也容易接受新鲜事物，许多人已在生产建设中发挥了不少作用。去年九月到鞍山钢铁公司选矿厂技术检查站工作的初中毕业生，经过短时期的学习，已基本上掌握了检查技术，现在正逐渐被调到更重要的岗位上去。去年到哈尔滨一个国营工厂作水暖工的高小毕业生朱路，由于积极工作，虚心学习，已能掌握水暖工的一般技术，并时常在车间会议上受到表扬；同时因为他很爱护工具，还被工人推选为车间的工具保管员。许多参加工业生产的学生还在工人业余学校兼任教员和协助工厂开展文娱与体育活动。参加农业生产的初中毕业生和高小毕业生显示的作用更大。河北省饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社有三十四个高小毕业生，其中有五个被送到拖拉机站学开拖拉机，两个学打井，一个到妇幼保健站学习，两个当了会计，两个当了农业技术员，一个当了副社长，其他的人当了记工员、民校教员和妇女生产队长等。辽东省西丰县榆树村去年秋季组织二十五名高小毕业生学习了饲养牲畜的新技术和有关家畜、家禽防疫及繁殖等方面的基本知识。他们去年帮助全村修建了六十二幢新式猪舍和十一间马棚、牛棚，并在该县畜牧技术干部的指导下，在该村和帮助邻村进行了猪瘟预防注射和牲畜预防注射。江苏省丰县第十一区大程庄乡赵屯村的十四个高小毕业生，推动村里农民成立了十五个互助组，不少人担任了互助组的组长和记工员。
    参加生产建设的中、小学毕业生，普遍受到重视和欢迎。不少工厂还为他们设立了技工训练班。许多老工人和他们订立师徒合同，热心地教他们生产技术。各地农民都热情地欢迎这批知识青年。有些老年农民说：“将来农村要使拖拉机，咱们这帮老家伙连个数字码都不认得，怎么使？如今学生参加生产可太好啦！”生产、工作得好的中、小学毕业生，群众就积极选他们当干部和劳动模范。热河省敖汉旗高小毕业生李恩凤，由于带动全村妇女搞好生产，被评为劳动模范，受到了热河省人民政府的奖励。黑龙江省绥化县蔡家村十八岁的高小毕业生蔡克基，由于劳动好、工作积极，被选为副村长。吉林省延吉县海兰村初中毕业生、青年团村支部书记、农业生产合作社副主任吕根泽，山东省掖县后吕村高小毕业生、农业生产合作社主任徐建春，陕西省渭南县南郭村高小毕业生、农业生产合作社副主任郭统绪等，都成为当地群众爱戴的人物。
