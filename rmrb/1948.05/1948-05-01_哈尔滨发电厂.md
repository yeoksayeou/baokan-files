　　I stayed in Harbin for a period of time. Apart from the general impressions of the strict order of the city under the democratic government, the improvement of the lives of the vast poor citizens, the stability of industry and commerce, and the richness of the cultural life of the people, what touched me the most was that in this short period, I had begun to see the internal strength of this beautiful city of ours being brought into play. Thanks to the exertion of this internal strength, Harbin is undergoing changes that it has never experienced since the years it began to be built. It is becoming younger and more filled with new vitality. What is this internal strength? First of all, it is the increasing awareness of the broad masses of workers in all walks of life.
　　We visited a number of large-scale public enterprises. Among the ordinary employees of all the public enterprises we met, two sentences were popular: "The factory is our own now." "Serve the people, serve the victory of the war of self-defense." From all the facts we have come into contact with, they are indeed building their new working lives in this spirit.
　　A visit to the power plant of the Electricity Bureau gave me a very profound education. I saw the great talent and wisdom of the working class, which had given significant help to our city's construction.
　　This factory, which generates tens of thousands of kilowatts of electricity every day, was completely preserved by the workers from the frenzied destruction of the Japanese invaders when the Red Army liberated Harbin on "August 15th." There are × huge boilers and × generators here. In the late period of the puppet Manchukuo regime, these machines had been out of use for a long time and partially damaged because Harbin used hydroelectric power from Xiaofengman in Jilin. In the early days of our army's entry into Harbin, the city still relied on Xiaofengman for power. However, after the Chiang bandits launched a civil war in the Northeast, on a certain day in the autumn of 1946, the Chiang bandits brazenly cut off this power supply, plunging Harbin into a dark situation without electricity. For a modern city, this attack was a major event related to the lives of hundreds of thousands of citizens.
　　The workers of the power plant gave a powerful response to this vicious and brazen attack by the Chiang bandits. They worked hard day and night in indignant emotions, overcame all kinds of difficulties in a completely unexpected short period of time, and quickly completed all the preparations for power generation. Thus, on a dim autumn evening, Harbin suddenly had its appearance illuminated by a bright electric light. The machines roared in the factories, the tap water transported fresh water, streetcars drove out of the factory one after another... The telephones in the power plant rang continuously with congratulatory voices from all sides, and the whole city cheered.
　　The director here is Comrade Xiao Changhai. Before our army entered Harbin, he was still a worker. Now, trusted by the 400 employees of the entire factory, he is in charge of all factory affairs. When he came out of the office to greet us, we simply couldn't tell the difference between him and ordinary workers. Short in stature, wearing a short coat stained with oil, his face covered with coal dust, and his right eye slightly squinting. He shook hands firmly with us, said only a few words, and immediately led us to visit the machine room. He advocated looking at the power production equipment first before talking about the factory situation. In each factory room, among those frighteningly large steel giants, he explained the efficiency and structural principles of each machine with extreme enthusiasm, in a voice that overwhelmed the noise of the machines, and traced their history and the process of repair. He spoke of various problems so familiarly, that he was more familiar with the principles and experiences of these machines than a farmer is with his simple hoe and plow, because he had been in this industry for more than twenty years. When I asked, "You have such skilled technical and management talents, why have you always been a worker in the past?" He wiped the dust off his eyebrows with the back of his hand and said simply, "What was the past? What about now? You understand: the factory is our workers' own."
　　In front of a rapidly rotating generator, a worker asked me: "Have you seen the movie 'Democratic Northeast'?" I said: "I've seen it." He said with joy: "Look, this is the No. × generator that was filmed in that movie. It was repaired by our labor hero Liu Yingyuan." The director told us: Liu Yingyuan miraculously repaired the seven blade segments of this generator, which was an important reason why the factory was able to resume mass power generation. If this machine part had been broken during the puppet Manchukuo period, it would have to be transported by plane to Dalian and then transshipped to Mitsubishi Corporation in Japan for repair. This time, many old senior technicians in the factory were at a loss. However, when the workers themselves managed the factory to serve the people and the war, Liu Yingyuan, who came from an ordinary worker background, repaired it in only twenty-eight days. Although he encountered some ridicule and instigation from some backward elements during the labor process, he did not waver in his great creative genius. When work was at its most intense, he did not leave the factory for two consecutive weeks. He finally made this untamed steel beast roar and spin obediently. I still remember the strong hands of Liu Yingyuan holding a huge wrench in that movie.
　　In the boiler room, the workers introduced us to the achievements of labor hero Zhang Kexing. Zhang Kexing took the lead in climbing into the boiler at a high temperature of 100 degrees Celsius and repaired a large sand-cast tile. The workers said: Some people may not believe this. At a high temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, eggs will cook instantly, how can people work? In the puppet Manchukuo period, there would definitely be a power outage for three days until the boiler completely cooled down before work could begin. "But," a worker repeated what the director had said: "Now the factory is our workers' own." He said: "None of us want a power outage, and none of us want to see those machines that are manufacturing military supplies for the front lines stop for nothing. Old Hero Zhang came up with a way to fix it quickly." He pointed to the boiler door, which was currently spewing raging flames, and explained the situation at the time: We cleared out all the coal fire. After a period of cooling, we laid thick straw mats and reed mats inside the boiler. The people who went in first put on thick clothes and draped themselves in burlap bags, and the water hose was constantly pouring cold water behind them. Under such circumstances, Zhang Kexing led several workers to lift out the broken two-hundred-jin sand-cast tile and replaced it with a new one. The boiler was sending out steam again.
　　Fortunately, this Old Hero Zhang had time to meet with us and give us a short report. He is from Haiyang County, Shandong Province. He came to Harbin to study electricity at the age of seventeen because of the famine. He has been working in this factory for a full twenty-eight years. He has a pair of eyes reddened by coal smoke and a newly shaved head. He is now the head of the boiler repair team. When I told him that I was from the Shandong Liberated Area, he grabbed my hand with joy and inquired about the situation in his hometown.

　　哈尔滨发电厂
    冠西
    我在哈尔滨逗留了一个时期，除了对民主政府治下的都市秩序之严整，广大贫苦市民生活之改善，工商业之稳定和人民大众文化生活之丰富等一般印象之外，使我感触最深的，是在这一不长的时日里，我已开始看到了我们这一美丽都市的内在力量已在发挥了出来。由于这一内在力量的发挥，哈尔滨正经历着从开始建设它的年代起，所从未经历过的变化，它正更加年青，更加充沛着新生的活力了。这种内在力量是什么？这首先便是各行各业广大工人群众的日益觉悟。
    我们曾经参观了若干规模宏大的公用企业。在所有我们遇到的公用企业的普通员工中，都流行着两句话：“工厂是我们自己的了。”“为人民服务，为自卫战争的胜利服务。”从我们接触的一切事实看来，他们的确是本着这种精神，来建设了自己新的劳动生活。
    在电业局发电厂的一次参观中，给了我很深刻的教育，我看见了工人阶级的伟大才能和智慧，这种伟大的才能和智慧，是曾经给了我们的都市建设以重大帮助的。
    这座每天发着×万基罗瓦特电力的工厂，在“八一五”红军解放哈市时，是被工人们从日寇的疯狂破坏中完整的保留下来的。这里有×个庞大的锅炉，×个发电机。伪满时代末期，曾因哈市使用吉林小丰满的水力发电，这些机器长久的停止了使用，并且部分的受到了损坏。我军进驻哈市的初期，全市仍然依靠小丰满供给电流。但当蒋匪在东北大打内战以后，一九四六年秋季的某日，蒋匪悍然的切断了这个电源，使哈市陷于没有电源的黯淡境地。对于一个近代化的都市，这一袭击是关系了几十万市民生活的重大事件。
    发电厂的工人们有力的回答了蒋匪这一恶毒的悍然袭击。他们在激愤的情绪中昼夜辛劳工作，在一完全出乎人们意料的短时期里，克服了种种困难，迅速的完成了一切发电的准备，于是，在一个黯淡的秋日的黄昏，哈市突然被一片明亮的电灯光芒，照亮了它的容貌。机器在各厂间里喧嚣了，自来水输送着新鲜的清水，电车一辆接一辆的开出了厂房……发电厂的电话机里，连续的响着各方祝贺的声音，全市欢腾了起来。
    这里的厂长是萧长海同志。我军进驻哈市以前，他还是一个工人，现在他却在全厂四百员工的信任下，全面掌理着厂务，当他从办公室走出来迎接我们时，我们简直认不出他和普通工人有着什么区别。矮矮的身材，穿着一件染满油垢的短衣，面孔沾着煤灰，右眼有些斜视。他结实的和我们握过手，仅仅说了一两句话，便立刻引我们到机械间参观，他是主张先看看电力生产设备以后再谈工厂情况的。在每个厂间里，在那些大得骇人的钢铁巨物之间，他极其热情的用压倒机器喧闹的声音，给我们解释每个机器的效能和构造原理，并且追述它们的历史和修复的经过。他那样熟悉的述说着种种问题，他对于这些机器的原理和经历，比农民熟悉他那把简单的锄头、犁耙还要熟悉，因为他干这行业，已经有二十多年的历史。当我问起：“你有这样纯熟的技术和管理才能，过去为什么一直在当工人？”他用手背擦去眉毛上的灰垢，简单的说：“过去是什么？现在呢？你明白：工厂是我们工人自己的了。”
    在一个迅疾旋转着的大发电机跟前，一个工人向我发问：“你看过‘民主东北’那部电影吗？”我说：“看过的。”他欣喜的说：“你看，这就是照在那部电影里的×号发电机。这是我们的劳动英雄刘英源修理好的。”厂长告诉我们：刘英源奇迹一样的修好了这部发电机的七页片，是使工厂能够恢复大量发电的重要原因。这个机件如果在伪满时代坏了，要用飞机运到大连，然后转运日本三菱公司才能修好。这次为了修理它，许多在厂的旧的高级技师都束手无策。然而，当工人自己管理工厂为人民为战争服务的今天，普通工人出身的刘英源只用了二十八天的时间就修好了它。他虽然在劳动过程中，遭到了若干落后分子的揶揄和挑拨，但他不动摇于自己伟大的创造天才，工作最紧张时，他曾一连两个礼拜没有离开厂房，他终于使这不驯服的钢铁的野兽，服服贴贴的咆哮着旋转起来。我还记得那部电影里，刘英源拿着巨大的螺丝扳子的强壮的双手。
    在锅炉间，工人们向我们介绍了劳动英雄张克兴的功迹。张克兴曾在一百度的高热下，带头爬进锅炉，修好了一个翻砂大瓦。工人们说：有的人会不相信这件事的，一百度的高热，鸡蛋都会立刻烫熟，人怎么能工作呢？要是伪满时代，一定要停电三天，等锅炉完全冷下来，才能动工。“可是，”一个工人重复厂长所说过的话：“现在工厂是我们工人自己的了。”他说：“我们谁都不愿意停电，谁都不愿意看着那些替前线制造军需品的机器，白白的停下来。张老英雄就想出了很快修好的办法。”他指着现在正喷着熊熊烈焰的锅炉门，说明当时的情形：我们把所有的煤火都清除出来，冷了一个时间以后，把锅炉里面铺上厚厚的草苫和席子，进去的人都先穿上厚厚的衣服，披上麻袋，后面用水龙管子不断浇着冷水，就在这样的情形下，张克兴带着几个工人把已烧断的二百斤重的翻砂大瓦抬出来，又换上了新的。锅炉又重新放送着蒸气了。
    很幸运，这位张老英雄有时间和我们见面，并且给我们作了一个短短的报告。他是山东海阳县人，十七岁上便因闹荒来哈市学电业。他在这个厂里劳动，算起来已是整整的二十八年了。他有着一双被煤烟熏红的眼睛和一个刚剃光的头顶。他现在已经担任了锅炉修理班的班长。当我告诉他我是从山东解放区来的时，他欣喜的抓住我的手，探询着家乡的情况。
