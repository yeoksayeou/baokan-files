Our newspaper's correspondent work has been further improved over the past year in terms of establishing working systems and strengthening business research. Internally, a division of labor system has been established, with specific personnel responsible for organizing and guiding correspondents' reports in each region. Analysis and research are conducted on the situation in each region and the correspondents' contributions, and "Situation Bulletins" are compiled as a reference for determining the reporting guidelines for each campaign stage. The submission situation is summarized monthly, and the focus of contact and reporting guidelines for the next month are proactively determined. Problems are raised, key points are grasped, and specific examples of counties, districts, and villages are used in "Correspondence" to guide various regions. In August and September of last year, two news and literary awards were held, which played a role in educating and encouraging correspondents.

Regarding the establishment of a communication network, since the New China News Agency's editorial "Commemorating September 1st, Implementing the Spirit of Serving the People" and the leadership's proposal of "Establishing a Rural Worker-Peasant Correspondent Network" and "Integrating Intellectuals with Workers and Peasants" last September, we have begun to proactively pay attention to this issue. For example, the Taixing Fourth Military Subdistrict, where communication work was relatively poor, also rectified and developed its communication organization. Especially after the Xuanlian Association issued a call to various regions last winter to reorganize the news teams and when reorganization began in various regions in January of this year, we obtained the direct help of the local Party committees and offices to rectify and develop the communication network during the reorganization of the teams. As of now, the number of correspondents has increased from 1,000 at the time of the newspaper's anniversary last year to more than 1,500, and the registration forms for correspondents from various regions are still being sent in continuously. Our correspondent team has greatly developed, and the quality of correspondents has been greatly improved. They are all county, district, and village cadres, workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals who have undergone reorganization, studied ideological positions, and stood in line.

On the other hand, in the past year, we have made "leftist" mistakes in our thinking and work. First, it was manifested in the wrong understanding of the organizational line of the communication network. Because we failed to carefully understand and grasp the spirit of "Establishing a Rural Worker-Peasant Correspondent Network, Integrating Intellectuals with Workers and Peasants" in the initial period, coupled with the one-sidedness of the petty-bourgeois ideological method, we had a tendency to despise and even exclude intellectuals. In daily work, this was manifested in distrust of intellectuals' contributions. In the article "Looking at the Basic Problems of Establishing a Rural Communication Network from the Neiqiu Communication Work" published on the fourth page of this newspaper on September 25th last year, this ideological emotion was even more severely revealed. The article required that intellectuals be transformed "well" before they could "cooperate" with workers and peasants to promote rural reporting work. How to determine what counts as being transformed "well"? The standard is difficult to determine. Moreover, they should be constantly transformed in their work, and it is impossible to talk about letting them be correspondents only after they have been transformed well. Because in the reality of our rural areas, if we do not give play to the cultural specialties of intellectuals (of course, they should humbly learn the good ideological style of workers and peasants and constantly transform themselves), it is difficult to imagine the establishment of a rural worker-peasant communication network. What's more, most of the intellectuals in the liberated areas today are our political and civilian cadres, revolutionary staff, and freelancers serving the new democratic society.

Leftist erroneous ideas are also manifested in the guidance of reporting work. The general spirit of the "Correspondence" No. 32 on December 10th last year, which organized winter production reporting, and the reporting guidelines for winter production and the anti-grain grabbing struggles in various regions issued to various regions on November 30th, was to emphasize that "poor peasants and farm laborers should be the backbone leaders and control the mass-based sideline production mutual aid groups," and did not mention how to unite middle peasants for joint production. It also said: "All reports should conform to the true position of poor peasants and farm laborers and conform to the interests of poor peasants and farm laborers and other peasants who have been emancipated." The anti-grain grabbing reporting guidelines emphasized that "the armed forces must be truly controlled by poor peasants and farm laborers." These are completely serious manifestations of ignoring the Party's policies. Our erroneous and one-sided view of poor peasants and farm laborers has had a certain impact on the leftist deviations that have occurred in reporting work in the past.

    在整顿队伍中发展通讯网
    本报一年来的通联工作
    本报的通联工作，一年来在建立工作制度、加强业务研究等方面都有了更进一步的改善。在内部工作上建立了分工制度，每个区域由专人负责组织及指导通讯员报导，并对每个区域的情况及通讯员来稿能够进行分析研究，编印“情况通报”，作为确定每个运动阶段的报导方针的参考。每月总结来稿情况，主动地定出下月联系重点及报导方针，提出问题，抓住关键，在“通讯往来”中以具体的县区村为例指导各地。在去年八、九两月，并举办两次新闻通讯文艺评奖，起了教育与鼓励通讯员的作用。
    在建立通讯网工作上，自去年九月新华社“纪念九一，贯彻为人民服务的精神”社论及领导上提出“建立农村工农通讯网”、“知识分子与工农结合”的问题以后，我们即开始主动地注意这一问题，如通讯工作较差的太行四分区也整顿并发展了通讯组织。特别是经过去冬宣联会对各地发出整编新闻队伍的号召及今年一月在各地开始整编的时候，我们取得各地党委、办公室的直接帮助，在整编队伍中整顿并发展通讯网。截至目前为止，通讯员已由去年本报周年时的一千人发展到一千五百余人，而各地的通讯员登记表尚在源源寄来。我们的通讯队伍是大大发展了，而且通讯员的质量是大大提高了，他们都是经过了整编学习思想站队的县、区、村干部，工农群众，及革命知识分子。
    另一方面，在过去一年中，我们思想上及工作上曾犯了左倾的错误。首先表现在对于通讯网的组织路线上的错误认识。由于我们对“建立农村工农通讯网、知识分子与工农结合”的精神，在最初一个时期没有能够仔细体会掌握，加上小资产阶级思想方法上的片面性，我们曾对知识分子发生了轻视甚至排斥的情绪。在日常工作上，表现对知识分子来稿的不信任。在去年九月二十五日本报第四版发表的“从内邱通讯工作来看建立农村通讯网的基本问题”一文中，更严重的表露了这种思想情绪，该文对知识分子要求改造“好”了以后，才能“配合”工农推进农村报导工作。怎样才算改造“好”了？标准是很难确定的。而且，应该是在工作中不断改造，不能空谈改造好了才让他们做通讯员。因为在我们的农村的现实情况下面，如果不发挥知识分子的在文化方面的特长（当然工农好的思想作风他们应该虚心学习，不断改造自己），农村工农通讯网的建立是很难想象的。何况今天解放区的知识分子，绝大部分都是我们的政民干部、革命职员，及为新民主主义社会服务的自由职业者。
    左倾错误思想，还表现在对报导工作的指导上，去年十二月十日三十二号“通讯往来”组织冬季生产报导及十一月三十日印发各地的冬季生产及各地反抢粮斗争的报导方针，总的精神是强调应以“贫雇为骨干领导，并掌握群众性的副业生产互助组”，对于如何团结中农共同生产则没有提到。并说：“一切报导应符合真正的贫雇立场，符合贫雇农及其他翻身农民利益。”反抢粮报导方针则强调“武装要真正为贫雇所掌握”。这些，完全是忽视党的政策的严重错误表现，对报导工作上过去所发生的左倾偏向，我们错误的片面贫雇观点是发生了它一定的影响的。
