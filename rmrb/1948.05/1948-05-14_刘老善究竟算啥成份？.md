    What Class Status Does Liu Laoshan Actually Belong To?
    To the Editor:
    Our work team has a household whose class status cannot be determined, and a dispute has arisen that we cannot resolve. We are hoping for a reply.

    Liu Laoshan of Heicheng Village, Second District, Lincheng County. Before 1944, his family originally had five mu of land. He did not engage in agricultural labor year-round. He knew how to make sesame candy, but he didn't do it regularly. His brother-in-law was a Kuomintang officer, and after he left, he gave Liu Laoshan thirty-six mu of land. Laoshan rented out the land, and Laoshan relied on the land rent for his main source of income, collecting rent for thirteen years. Adding his own land, he had a total of forty-one mu to support his livelihood. Laoshan considers himself a poor peasant, but the masses believe that he does not work and relies on rent for a living. Public discussion has determined him to be an exploiting landlord. Five of the work comrades believe that he does not exploit the land, but the land is actually his. However, he also makes sesame candy, which can be considered as other total income. He should be an old-style rich peasant. One person believes he is a tenant rich peasant.
    Please give us a reply.          (Work Team  Niu Baorong)

Comrade Baorong:
    This household cannot be considered an exploiting landlord, because the land is rented out and not farmed by hired laborers. Nor can it be considered an old-style rich peasant or a tenant rich peasant, because rich peasants must have someone participating in major agricultural labor. To determine his class status, there are several points that need to be clarified: 1. How many people are in the family, and how many are able-bodied laborers? 2. When he rents his brother-in-law's land, does he have to pay rent to his brother-in-law again? 3. How is his own five mu of land farmed? If the family population is not too large, and there are able-bodied laborers (men aged eighteen to fifty), but they do not engage in major agricultural labor, and the total amount of land exceeds that of a middle peasant, and he does not need to pay rent to his brother-in-law again, and his own land is also rented out, and he also makes and sells sesame candy, he can be considered a landlord engaged in handicraft labor. If the population is large and the average land per person does not exceed that of a middle peasant; or he has to pay rent to his brother-in-law, and the total annual income can only maintain a life that is less than that of an average middle peasant, then he cannot be considered a landlord. If, according to the situation before the spring of 1944, he was determined to be a landlord, and his status has declined since the establishment of the local democratic government, then it has not been five years yet. After engaging in any labor for five years after the decline, his class status can be changed according to the actual situation.

    刘老善究竟算啥成份？
    编辑同志：
    我们工作组有一个户没办法划成份，发生了争论，没法解决，请答复我们为盼。
    临城县二区黑城村刘老善，民国三十三年以前，他本家原有五亩地，他常年不从事农业劳动，本人会炸麻糖，也不经常干，他有一个妹夫当国民党的军官，走后把他三十六亩地给刘老善，老善把地租出去，老善靠地租子作生活主要来源，收租十三年。加他自己地共地四十一亩来顾生活的，老善自认是个贫农，群众认为他不劳动，并依靠租子生活，公议是经营地主。工作同志五人，认为他不经营地，地实际是他所有的，但他也炸麻糖，可作其他总收入算，他应是旧式富农，一个人认为他是佃富农。
    请给我们答复。          （工作组  牛宝荣）宝荣同志：
    这户不能认为经营地主，因为土地是租出而不是雇人种的；也不能认为旧式富农或佃富农，因为富农必需是有人参加主要农业劳动的。确定他的成份，有几点需要弄清楚：一、家里人口多少，全劳力几个？二、他妹夫的地给他转租出去，要不要再给他妹夫缴租子？三、他自己的五亩地怎样种的？如果家里人口不是太多，有全劳动力（十八岁至五十岁的男子），而不从事主要农业劳动，土地总数超过中农，也不需要再给他妹夫缴租子，自己的地也是租出去的，自己也炸麻糖卖，可认为地主兼手工业劳动者。如果人口多每人占有土地平均数不超过中农；或者还要给他妹夫缴租子，每年总收入只能维持不及一般中农的生活，就不能认为地主。如果按民国三十三年春天以前的情形确定是地主，当地民主政府成立后下降了，那到现在还不够五年。下降后从事任何劳动满五年，就可以按实际情形改变成份。
