　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Tyranny
    Chiang Notes are Worthless
    In Jining, the most worthless thing is Chiang notes. 20,000 yuan can only buy one bun, 100,000 yuan can buy a pound of fried dough cakes, 20,000 yuan can buy a pot of water. White flour costs 60,000 yuan per pound, dark flour costs 48,000 yuan per pound, white cloth costs 50,000 yuan per foot, millet costs 50,000 yuan per pound, and each斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) costs 1,500,000 yuan.
    Puppet Bandits Press-Gang Soldiers, Driving People to Death
    Chiang Kai-shek bandits are frantically grabbing soldiers in both urban and rural areas. In Jining's eastern suburbs, outside Dongguan, a young man named Zhao was only nineteen years old. His family of five depended on him alone to sell vegetables for a living, but unfortunately, on February 20th, he was captured by the puppet bandit Wu Huawen's troops. After hearing this, his family searched for him for four or five days without finding any trace. The family has been left with no one to support them, constantly crying and starving. His father, deeply grieved and worried about the family's livelihood, committed suicide by jumping into a well on the afternoon of February 28th. His wife strangled their child, who was less than two years old, one night and then hanged herself.
    Life in Jining is Impossible, They Flee to the Liberated Areas
    Jining was flooded last year, and the harvest was bad! The lives of the people were already hard enough, but from last autumn to now, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been levying 35 jin of wheat and more than 50 jin of coarse grains per mu. The people had no grain to eat even before the New Year, and in the spring, they only ate tree leaves, tree bark, and wild vegetables. Some people pushed carts and carried loads, making a business of buying and selling, earning ten or eight jin of coarse grains. Women spun cotton and wove cloth to earn money to buy four or five jin of grain, but this was also snatched away by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The Zhang family in Zhang Village in the southeast township had six members, two of whom starved to death. Later, they sold their clothes and quilts to buy more than ten jin of sorghum, but it was also seized by the bandits. The whole family cried and begged bitterly, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandits replied, "Get out! Whose sorghum is this? Eating for us is more important than eating for you!" The old woman was even beaten by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and became ill and died as a result. Many people, unable to bear the enemy's persecution, have fled to the liberated areas. In Jianglou Village, east of the city, alone, out of more than 300 households, 210 have fled.
    The People Long for the People's Liberation Army
    Whenever the People's Liberation Army wins a victory, the news reaches the ears of the people of Jining. They are excited and encouraged, eagerly hoping that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them soon. Old women burn incense and kowtow at home, cursing Chiang Kai-shek bandits to die quickly and hoping that the People's Liberation Army will come quickly. When children cry from hunger, adults always stroke their little heads and comfort them, saying, "Good child, wait a little longer. When the Eighth Route Army comes, we won't go hungry anymore, and we'll have white buns to eat then."

### 蒋匪的暴政

　　蒋匪的暴政
    蒋票不值钱
    济宁最不值钱的是蒋票，二万元才买一个馍馍，十万元买一斤油饼，二万元买一壶水，白面每斤六万元，黑面每斤四万八千元，白布每尺五万元，小米每斤五万元，每斗一百五十万。
    伪匪抓兵逼死人
    蒋匪在城关和乡下疯狂的抓兵。济宁东关外一个姓赵的青年才十九岁，他家五口人靠他一个人卖青菜维持生活，但不幸在二月二十日被伪匪吴化文的队伍抓去，家里听说后，找了四五天没找到下落，一家人从此没人供养，整天的痛哭挨饿，他父亲因极伤心，更愁一家人的生活，在二月二十八日的下午跳井死了。他妻子在一天夜间用绳子勒死了他不满二岁的小孩，自己也吊死了。
    济宁没法活，逃来解放区
    济宁去年被淹了，年景不好！老百姓本来就够苦了，从去年秋天到现在，每亩地又被蒋匪征收麦子三十五斤，粗粮五十多斤，老百姓在年前就已经没有粮食吃了，到春天只吃些树叶子、树皮和野菜。有的推车担担子作买卖，挣个十斤八斤粗粮，女人纺花织布赚点钱买四、五斤粮食，也要被蒋匪抢走。东南乡张庄一家六口人，饿死了两口，后来卖了自己的衣服被子，买了十多斤高粱，也被匪抢了去，全家人哭着苦苦哀求，但蒋匪回答说：“滚！谁们的高粱，你吃没有我们吃要紧！”老太太还被蒋匪打了一顿，这个老太太因此气病而死。很多老百姓不堪敌人的迫害，纷纷逃来解放区，仅城东姜楼村三百多户人家，就逃了二百一十户。
    人民盼望解放军
    每逢解放军打了一个胜仗，消息都会传到济宁人民的耳朵里，他们兴奋鼓舞，热切的盼望着解放军快去解放他们。老太太们在家里烧香磕头，咒骂蒋匪快快死，盼望解放军快快去。小孩子饿了哭的时候，大人总是摸着他的小头顶安慰的说：“好孩子，等着吧，八路军来了我们就不挨饿了，到那时候给你白馍馍吃。”
