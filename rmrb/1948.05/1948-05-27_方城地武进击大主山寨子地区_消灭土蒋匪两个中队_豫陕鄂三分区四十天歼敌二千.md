Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 24th: Fangcheng local armed forces, in coordination with a unit of the Liberation Army, annihilated two companies of intruding local Chiang bandit Zhu Xi'an's troops in the Dazhushan Zhaizi area on the 9th of this month. The operation resulted in the killing of over twenty enemies, including company commander Wang Guantang, and the capture of over eighty enemies, along with the seizure of one machine gun, over a hundred rifles, and three pistols. This group of bandits was organized by local tyrant Wang Guantang in the eastern mountains of Fangcheng in January. On January 27th, they attacked the democratic village government of Hucheng Village, injuring seven militiamen. The local masses were delighted by their annihilation.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 24th: Delayed news: The Third Military Sub-district (governing counties south of the Luo River, including Song County, Yiyang, Yichuan, and Luanchuan) announced the results of its forty-day bandit suppression campaign from March 2nd to April 11th. According to incomplete statistics: In eight battles, large and small, 326 Chiang bandits were killed or wounded, including the puppet Luoning County Chief and concurrently Self-Defense Commander Dong Hairong (killed). Furthermore, 1,807 were captured, including Luoning Self-Defense Deputy Commander Han Qinghai, Deputy and Battalion Commander of the Second Detachment Liu Yutang, Deputy and Battalion Commander of the Fifth Detachment Zhang Guowei, Deputy and Battalion Commander of the Eleventh Detachment Zhang Zhenjing, Special Service Battalion Commander Zhang Jinsheng, and others. The operation yielded the seizure of sixteen light machine guns, eight hundred and eighteen rifles, sixty-nine pistols, eleven submachine guns, over 26,000 rounds of ammunition, over 20,000 catties of grain, and other spoils of war. According to the Deputy Commander of the military sub-district, the main experiences in the forty-day bandit suppression were: (1) Cadres personally conducted reconnaissance to grasp the situation and understand the activity patterns of the local Chiang bandits before carrying out the suppression. (2) A mass bandit suppression movement was launched, including guiding the way and providing intelligence. In areas where close contact was maintained with the masses and the mass movement was mobilized, the bandit suppression work proceeded easily. (3) In-depth political mobilization was carried out, and mobilization slogans were put forward in a timely manner according to the situation, such as the five "not afraid of": 1. Not afraid of striking empty, 2. Not afraid of fatigue, 3. Not afraid of rain, 4. Not afraid of walking at night, 5. Not afraid of crossing rivers. At the same time, two "mores" were put forward in the bandit suppression: more captured bandits and more captured guns, and rewards were given to heroes of bandit suppression. At present, the indigenous bandit forces in the military sub-district have been largely eliminated, and the bandit suppression troops are stepping up their efforts to prepare for the complete completion of the bandit suppression mission.

    【新华社豫陕鄂二十四日电】方城地方武装配合解放军一部，本月九日在大主山寨子地区，歼灭进扰土蒋匪朱希安部两个中队，毙中队长王贯堂以下二十余名，俘八十余名，缴机枪一挺，步枪百余支，短枪三支。按该股土匪是当地恶霸王贯堂于一月间在方城东山所组织的，一月二十七日曾袭击我祜城村民主村公所，伤害民兵七人，这次被歼，当地群众莫不称快。
    【新华社豫陕鄂二十四日电】迟到消息：三分区（辖洛河以南之嵩县，伊阳、伊川、滦川等县）公布三月二日至四月十一日四十天剿匪战果，据不完全统计：大小战斗八次，毙伤蒋匪伪洛宁县长兼自卫总队长董海容（毙）以下三百二十六人，俘洛宁自卫总队副韩青海，二支队副兼大队长刘玉堂、五支队副兼大队长张国威、十一支队副兼大队长张振京、特务大队长张金生等以下一千八百零七人。缴获轻机枪十六挺，步枪八百十八支，短枪六十九支，手提机枪等十一支，子弹两万六千余发，粮食两万多斤，及其他胜利品一部。据该分区副司令员谈，四十天来的剿匪经验主要是：（一）干部亲自侦察掌握情况，了解土蒋匪活动规律，然后进行清剿。（二）发动群众性剿匪运动，如带路送情报等，凡与群众密切联系，群众运动发动起来的地方，那里的剿匪工作就容易进行。（三）深入政治动员，根据情况及时提出动员口号，如提出五不怕：一不怕扑空，二不怕疲劳，三不怕淋雨，四不怕走夜路，五不怕过河。同时在剿匪中又提出两多：俘匪多，缴枪多，奖励剿匪功臣等。现该分区土著匪军已大部肃清，剿匪部队正加紧努力准备全部完成剿匪任务。
