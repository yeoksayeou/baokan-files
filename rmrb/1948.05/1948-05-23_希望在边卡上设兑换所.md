According to Mr. Gong, a Zhoucun merchant from Jinan: he has been trading in our area for quite some time and has the following two reflections on the facilities of our border area tax authorities and the promotion of our industrial and commercial policies:

	I. They feel it is very inconvenient to operate because the commodities currently permitted for import are inconsistent across our liberated areas. For example, when he started operating last year, he carefully inquired beforehand which commodities were legal to import. The commodities – palm-leaf fans – that the person in charge of the Dezhou Bureau of Industry and Commerce had clearly stated and taxed according to regulations, became illegal after entering Linqing, and it took a lot of trouble to resolve. He also said that "foreign colors" are legal in the Southern Hebei area, but illegal in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area.

	II. Regarding the commodities imported from Jinan via Qiyu County Guoyao in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area this time, because we stipulate that Chiang Kai-shek's currency is absolutely not allowed to enter the country, and there are no "exchange offices" on the border, it is said that some merchants often leave more goods for tax declaration, or find other shopkeepers to guarantee them, and the time delayed in the procedures takes two or three days. The feeding and consumption of vehicles and livestock often exceed the amount of tax they should pay.

Therefore, the hope is: 1. The government should set up "exchange offices" at the border passes to facilitate currency exchange. 2. Regarding our industrial and commercial and tax policies, it is best to issue a "Notice to Foreign Merchants on Transportation or Tax Payment" to foreign merchants, specifically explaining "What does the government want us to do?" "How to do it?" This is much more effective than simply publicizing theories.

### 希望在边卡上设兑换所

　　希望在边卡上设兑换所
    据新从济南来的周村商人宫先生谈：他往来我区作买卖已经好长时间了，对我们边沿区税收机关的设施及对我们工商政策的宣传，有如下两个反映：
    一、对我们各解放区现时许可入口商品不一致，他们感觉经营时很不方便。象去年他开始经营时，事前曾很仔细的探听哪样商品输入是合法的。经德州工商局负责人当面谈明并按章报税的商品——芭蕉扇入口后到临清又弄成违法了，结果费了不少周折才了事。又说现时的“洋色”在冀南合法，但在冀鲁豫又非法了。
    二、此次由济南经冀鲁豫齐禹县郭窑入口的商品，由于我们规定蒋币绝对不容许入境，而边境上又没有“兑换所”，据说往往有的商人多留货报税，或另找铺保，手续上耽误的时间得两三天，车辆牲畜的喂养消耗，时常超过他们应交的税额。
    为此希望：一、政府应在边卡上设“兑换所”，以便利货币兑换。二、对我们的工商及税收政策，最好应印发一种对外商的“贩运或纳税须知”，具体说明政府要我们“作什么？”“怎样作？”这样比单纯宣传理论的实效要大得多。
