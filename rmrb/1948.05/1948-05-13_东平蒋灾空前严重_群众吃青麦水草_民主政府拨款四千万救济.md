[Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 10th Dispatch] The Chiang Kai-shek disaster in Dongping is extremely serious. Our democratic government is leading the people to rise up and help themselves. Last spring, Chiang's bandits violated the agreement and released water at Huayuankou, causing the Yellow River to rise in the summer, along with the Grand Canal, the Daqing River, the Xiaoqing River, and the Wen River. At the same time, continuous rainy days caused accumulated water in the eleven counties surrounding Dongping to pour into Dongping Lake, turning this rich wheat-producing area into a vast and boundless swamp. The Chiang Kai-shek's Dongping Seventh District Department opened the Grand Canal embankment at Jinkou, flooding more than fifty peaceful villages, creating an unprecedented disaster. In addition, from August of last year to April of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek's 72nd Division and other troops, combined with the Chiang Kai-shek's Dongping and Shouzhang county governments and the "Returning Home Corps," twice occupied Dongping City and carried out unprecedented oppression and devastation of the people. Currently, the enemy in Wenshang City still constantly loots in the Dongping territory at night, fining households. They even steal the tattered clothes and quilts of the masses and sell them cheaply in Wenshang City. In Sun Zhifang Village, District One, 167 households had 27 people arrested by the enemy in the past eight months, and it cost 100,000 catties of wheat to redeem them. Eight households had everything looted by the enemy. The entire village bears a burden of 100 catties of grain per mu to the enemy. Last autumn, due to the Chiang-made flood disaster, the entire village planted half as much wheat as usual. In Li Zhifang Village, District Six, 85 households were looted eleven times in the past eight months, and 74 households had their grain looted. The Seventh District was especially heavily oppressed and devastated by the enemy. In Gulou, the burden to the enemy is 180 catties of grain per mu, in Hou Caizi it is 110 catties, and in Qiaokou, only 50 households have been forced by the enemy to the point where eight households are begging for food, and 70 households are eating willow leaves, green barley, and aquatic plants. Our democratic government has successively allocated 45 million yuan and 50,000 catties of grain since January to provide relief to the disaster victims to maintain their lives and carry out production. In addition, the democratic government is now actively leading the masses to plan the construction of dikes for the Grand Canal and the Daqing River.

    东平蒋灾空前严重
    群众吃青麦水草
    民主政府拨款四千万救济
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】东平蒋灾严重，我民主政府领导人民奋起自救。去年春蒋匪违约在花园口放水，以致入夏黄河水涨，运河、大清河、小清河、汶河亦涨水，同时连日阴雨，东平周围十一县积水均灌东平湖，使这块富饶的产麦区，即变为茫茫无边的泽国。蒋记东平七区部，又于靳口打开运河堤水淹五十多个和平村庄，造成空前的灾难。再加自去年八月至今年四月，蒋匪七十二师等部队结合蒋记东平、寿张等县府及还乡团，曾两次窜占东平城，对人民进行了空前的压榨摧残，现汶上城敌人还不断夜间到东平境内抢劫，挨户罚款，他们把群众的破衣被也抢去拿到汶上城内贱卖。一区孙纸坊村一百六十七户，在过去八个月中被敌抓去二十七人，花十万斤麦子赎回，八户被敌抢光一切东西。全村对敌负担每亩一百斤粮，去秋因蒋制水灾，全村少种麦子二分之一，六区李纸坊村八十五户，在过去八个月中被抢掠十一次，现有七十四户被掠光粮食。七区被敌压榨摧残尤甚，古楼对敌负担每亩一百八十斤粮，后蔡子一百一十斤，桥口只五十户人家，被敌逼得有八户要饭，七十户吃杨叶青大麦水草。我民主政府从一月份起，已先后拨款四千五百万元，粮食五万斤，贷给灾民维持生活，并进行生产。另外，现在民主政府正积极领导群众筹划修设运河大清河的堤坝。
