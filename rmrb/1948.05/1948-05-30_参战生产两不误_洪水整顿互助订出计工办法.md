　　Combining Participation in War and Production

  　Hongshui Village Rectifies Mutual Aid and Formulates Work Point Methods
    [Wuxiang News] Hongshui Village in Wuxiang County accepted this task of participating in the war. The chairman of the Farmers' Association immediately convened a mass meeting to discuss how to combine participation in the war with production. During the discussion, everyone said, "We have turned ourselves around and are living a good life. We must also save our class brothers and sisters in the enemy-occupied areas." Following this, 24 people signed up to participate in the war at the front, and 57 people volunteered to transport supplies in the rear. Women, children, and old men said, "You can go to the front and fight with peace of mind. We will guarantee to cultivate the land well for everyone, complete the sowing, and we will be responsible for taking care of all the chores at home." In this way, everyone's enthusiasm was very high.
    In order to organize and lead production, the Farmers' Association committee convened a mass meeting of the people at home the next evening to adjust mutual aid and organize production. Mainly relying on experienced old farmers, people voluntarily combined. A total of 119 women, children, and old men in the village who could work in the fields organized 33 groups. 122 women who could not work in the fields also organized 15 spinning and weaving groups. After organization, a sowing plan was formulated: sowing in the back-lying fields first, then in the sunny fields, ensuring that both those participating in the war and those at home would have their land sown, with the women who could not work in the fields helping at home. In order to consolidate the mutual aid groups and prevent anyone from suffering losses, the standards for calculating temporary labor were discussed and formulated: (1) Each day's work is calculated as ten points, with two and a half points for the early morning, four points for the morning, and three and a half points for the evening. (2) Plowing 14 mu of land with a seeder drawn by a person or plowing 3 mu of land each counts as ten work points. Thinning four plots of foreign cotton seedlings counts as one work point, and carrying manure is calculated according to the number of trips and the distance of the land. Other special small tasks are evaluated on a temporary basis. (3) Oxen are calculated at two work points per ox. Plowing 3 mu of land or sowing 14 mu of grain each counts as twenty work points. The calculation of work points for women's spinning and weaving is five taels of spun cotton, six chi of woven cloth, two hundred chi of warp, and one pair of sewn trousers each count as ten work points. Making a pair of shoes counts as eighty work points, and sewing a cloth shirt counts as thirty work points. The method of implementation is to exchange work tickets with each other and settle accounts based on the work tickets. This kind of work point regulation resolved everyone's fear of suffering losses, and all the labor force actively took action. In particular, the women's enthusiasm was very high. They said, "In the past, we were looked down upon by men because we didn't know how to work in the fields. This time, they are going to participate in the war, and we will study field work hard at home, cultivate the land well, and they won't be able to look down on us when they come back, will they? This is a good opportunity to improve the status of our women." Under such enthusiasm, men, women, old, and young in the whole village actively worked. They are now weeding foreign cotton and sowing grain.

　　参战生产两不误
  　洪水整顿互助订出计工办法
    【武乡消息】武乡洪水村接受了这次参战任务，农会委员即召开了群众会议进行讨论，提出参战和生产如何结合。讨论中大家都说：“咱们翻了身过好了时光，还得挽救敌占区被压迫的阶级弟兄。”接着就有二十四人报名要到前方参战，五十七人自报要在后方运输。妇女儿童和老汉们说：“你们去参战要安心，俺们在家保证给大家种好地，完成下种，家里的一切杂事有俺们负责照管。”这样大家情绪很高。
    农会委员会为了有组织的领导生产，在第二天晚上即召开了在家群众会议，调整互助，组织生产。以技术老汉为主，自愿结合。全村能上地的妇女儿童老汉共一一九人，组织了卅三个小组。不能上地的妇女一二二个，也组织了十五个纺织组。经过组织，订出了下种计划：先种背地后种阳地，参战在家的要都种上，不能上地的妇女在家帮忙。为了巩固互助组，互不吃亏，即讨论订出临工计工的标准：（一）每天的工以十分计算，早二分五，上午四分，晚上三分五。（二）人拉耧种十四亩、耕地三亩、各计工十分。挽洋棉苗四池计工一分，担圊粪是按回数及地的远近来计算。其他特殊小活临时评议。（三）耕牛按一牛二工计算。耕地三亩、种谷十四亩、各计工二十分。妇女纺织计工是纺花五两、织布六尺、经布二百尺、缝裤一条、计工十分。做鞋一双计工八十分，缝布衫一件计工三十分。执行的办法是；互相传换工票，以工票算帐。经过了这样计工规定，解决了大家怕吃亏思想，全部劳力积极行动起来。特别是妇女的劲头很大。她们说：“过去咱被男人小看，是咱不会上地的过。这次他们去参战，咱们在家好好学习地里营生，把土地种好，他们回来还能小看咱？这次可是提高咱妇女的好机会。”在这样热情下，全村的男女老幼都积极劳动起来。现正在锄洋棉花、种谷。
