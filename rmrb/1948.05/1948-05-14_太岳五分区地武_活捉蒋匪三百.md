    Local Armed Forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Taiyue
    Capture 300 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Alive
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th] The local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Taiyue have won another great victory. On the 4th, after recovering Daying Town, the seat of the puppet 11th Special Administration Office, the puppet commissioner Qin Tingyu fled and then gathered more than 1,000 men from Li Zikui's department in Lingbao, the puppet Shan County Self-Defense Column, and local bandits Liu Hanzhi, Huo Junfa, and Lu Shui. They first went to Zhangbian, forty miles south of Shan County, planning to reoccupy the city of Shan County, but they were severely beaten by our unit and the local armed forces of Shan (County) and Yuan (Qu) on the morning of the 6th. Qin Tingyu quickly fled again, and the rest were scattered by us. We captured more than 300 people alive, including Deputy Regiment Commander and concurrently Battalion Commander Liu Huamin, killed and wounded more than 30 people below the deputy battalion commander level, and seized two American-style heavy machine guns, eleven light machine guns, one hundred and forty-two rifles, one submachine gun, three short guns, more than 10,500 rounds of ammunition, nine warhorses, and many other military supplies.
