[Report from our newspaper] Following the Central Bureau's instructions on industrial and commercial policies and Comrade Chen Boda's publication of "Labor Policy and Tax Policy for Developing Industry," the leadership of this newspaper's printing plant immediately conducted a preliminary inspection of the plant's wage system in accordance with the spirit of the policies. They discovered that not only were wages too high, but there were also serious egalitarian errors. According to the current wage regulations, a third-grade, first-level worker receives 300 catties of millet per month, which is exactly equal to the high wage standard of military factories criticized in the Central Bureau's instructions. A first-grade, first-level worker receives 390 catties, which is lower than the aforementioned standard. However, the wages of trainees are much higher than the apprentice treatment stipulated in the aforementioned regulations (150 catties per month)—a first-level trainee receives 230 catties per month, a second-level trainee receives 210 catties, and a third-level trainee receives 190 catties, not much different from the technical workers. For example, the difference between a first-level trainee's wage and a standard worker's wage of 280 catties is only 50 catties. Egalitarianism is also reflected in the fact that there is no difference in wages between the various departments of the printing plant, despite differences in labor intensity and technical complexity.

The formation of egalitarianism has its historical roots. During the Anti-Japanese War, the printing plant operated under a supply system. After the wage system was revised, apprentice treatment still referred to the organ's supply system, emphasizing equality in living enjoyment. For example, clothing, food, and pocket money were the same for workers and trainees, and trainees also received technical allowances (up to 50 catties of millet per month for first-level trainees). On the other hand, after the land reform, peasants obtained land and their living standards improved. Workers unilaterally compared their living standards with those of the peasants and wanted to become cadres. If the treatment was meager, it would be difficult to recruit apprentices. In fact, the living standards of the plant's workers were generally much richer than those of the local middle peasants. A second-level trainee could support a wife and a child, and still save an average of six or seven thousand yuan per month, enough for clothes. Such an egalitarian high-wage system is mainly caused by the tailism of the plant's management, unconditionally accommodating backward thinking, resulting in a wage system that is not high where it should be and not low where it should be, which is completely inconsistent with Comrade Chen Boda's proposed reasonable and appropriate progressive wage system based on piecework, grade, points, and savings (reducing production capital). Not only does it fail to stimulate workers to study technology and improve production enthusiasm, but on the contrary, once workers enter the plant, their lives become richer, and they can even support their families, which relatively reduces their enthusiasm for creative research. Among the workers, especially the trainees, there is a widespread mentality of waiting for seniority and waiting for promotion. After reaching a certain number of years, they can be promoted step by step, even if they are not promoted, their lives are guaranteed. Generally, trainees express great satisfaction with the wage system after entering the plant. However, some have been in the plant for more than three years, and their skills have not improved, and they are still trainees. At the same time, due to the unfair wages between departments, one department always wants to jump to another department, because the technology of the plate-making department is simpler than that of the typesetting and machine rooms, some workers in these two departments want to work in the plate-making department. From the perspective of the entire factory, the wage system does not play a role in stimulating production. Usually, business innovations and improvements are generated by the leadership's political encouragement or certain campaign upsurges, rather than regular and conscious improvement and research. For example, after the Three Check-ups study, the entire production process of the newspaper this year has been shortened, the quality has been improved, and there has also been progress in saving raw materials. For example, the typesetting department's initial proofreading errors used to be as high as more than 10 per thousand, but now they have been reduced to 1 to 3 per thousand. The machine department's plate-mounting time used to be 40 minutes to one hour, but now it is 19 minutes to 27 minutes. The plate-making department can pour eight paper molds from one piece of rough-edged paper (formerly two or three pieces). However, according to responsible comrades, this is mainly due to political education, and after the upsurge is over, it is easy to become fatigued. Now, the labor-management sides are inspecting and researching these specific situations based on these situations, and have initially put forward opinions on correcting and reducing wages, waiting for unified regulations to resolve. At the same time, after May Day, the whole factory will launch a study of industrial policies to improve political awareness, as a preparation for correcting the wage system.

### 本报印刷厂根据中央局指示　初步检查工资制度　发现工资过高且有平均主义

　　本报印刷厂根据中央局指示
  　初步检查工资制度
  　发现工资过高且有平均主义
    【本报消息】中央局关于工商业政策的指示及陈伯达同志的“发展工业的劳动政策与税收政策”发表后，本报印刷厂领导方面当即根据政策精神，对厂内工资制度作了初步检查，发现不但工资过高，且还有相当严重的平均主义错误。按现行工资规定：三等一级者每月小米三百斤，和中央局指示中所批评的军工等厂的高工资规定恰相等，一等一级者三百九十斤，低于前项规定。但练习生工资却较前项规定的学徒待遇（每月一百五十斤）高的多——一级练习生每月二百卅斤，二级二百一十斤，三级一百九十斤，和技术工人差额不大。如一级练习生和标准工人工资二百八十斤，其相差只五十斤。平均主义还表现在印刷各部门劳动强度与技术繁简不同，而工资上没有差别。平均主义的形成，是有其历史根源的。印刷厂在抗日战争时期是供给制，改订工资制度以后，学徒待遇也还参照机关供给制，强调生活享受上的平均。如穿用费、食用费、零用费工人和练习生相同，而练习生还要领技术津贴（一级的每月高至小米五十斤）。另一方面土改中农民获得土地，生活改善，工人片面的与农民比生活，想当干部，若待遇微薄，学徒就不易招收。实际上，该厂工人生活一般都比当地中农生活富裕的多。一个二级练习生养活一个老婆，一个孩子，每月平均还可节余六、七千元，足供衣服。这样平均主义的高工资制度，主要是厂方的尾巴主义，无原则的迁就落后思想所造成，形成该高不高，该低不低的工资待遇，是完全不符合于陈伯达同志提出的按件、按等、按分、按节约（减低生产资本）等的合理与适当的累进工资制度的。不但不能刺激工人钻研技术，提高生产热忱，相反地，工人一进厂，生活就较富裕，甚或还可养活家属，创造研究钻研技术的热情就相对减低。工人中间，特别是练习生中间，普遍存在着熬年限，等升级的思想，熬到一定年限就可一步步往上升，即便不升生活也有保障。一般练习生进厂后对工资制度表示非常满意。但有的进厂三年多，技术提不高，依然是练习生。同时由于各部门间工资不公平，这一部门老想往另一部门跳，因为打版部的技术较排字房和机器房的简单，这两部门的某些工人就想到打版部工作。就整个工厂讲，工资制度起不了刺激生产的作用。平时业务上的创造改进，都是由于领导上的政治鼓舞或一定的运动热潮下产生的，而不是经常的自觉的改进钻研。例如经过三查学习，今年报纸整个生产过程缩短，质量提高，原料节省也都有进步。如排字部初校错字过去最高到千分之十以上，现在减少到千分之一到三。机器部上版时间，过去为四十分到一点钟，现在则为十九分到二十七分钟。打版部一张毛边纸纸型可浇八张（过去两张或三张）。但据负责同志谈，这主要是靠政治教育，热潮一过，容易疲塌下去。现在劳资双方正根据这些具体情况，检查研究，已初步提出改正与减低工资意见，等候统一规定解决。同时在五一节后将要展开全厂职工对工业政策的学习，提高政治觉悟，作为改正工资制度的准备。
