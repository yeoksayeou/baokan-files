Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: The second phase of the large-scale training movement for the second-line troops of the rear military regions of the Northeast People's Liberation Army has been widely launched on "May 1st." The experience of the first phase of large-scale training last winter has provided excellent conditions for this movement. A few days ago, the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region held a training meeting, which determined that the educational policy and plan should be to train politics first and then military affairs, and to organically combine the military and political aspects. In the political training stage, land reform education is the main focus, with policy and ideological education conducted with emphasis, so that the broad masses of commanders and fighters can understand the relationship between land reform policies, urban industrial and commercial policies, and the War of Liberation. At the same time, due to the victorious development of the situation in the Northeast and the rapid southward movement of the front line, preventing and correcting the tendency of slackness should also be an important educational content. In the military education stage, technology is the main focus, supplemented by tactics. Military education time accounts for 60% of the total training time. The principle of repeated teaching is adopted, with shooting, grenade throwing, and bayonet fighting techniques taking precedence, followed by education in blasting, night combat, and other areas. Tactical training will focus on Commander Lin Biao's tactical thinking and tactical movements, emphasizing the consistency of learning and application, closely linking it with actual battlefield experience, and opposing formalism. In the training, each unit should also carry out "military," "political," and "economic" democratic movements under centralized leadership to create a mass training upsurge.

  　东北二线兵团大练兵
    【新华社东北十六日电】东北解放军后方各军区第二期第二线大规模练兵运动，已于“五一”广泛展开。去冬第一期大练兵经验，使此次运动具备了优越条件。日前东北军区政治部曾召开练兵会议，确定教育方针与计划为先练政治后练军事，并使军政两者有机的结合起来。在练政治阶段中，以土改教育为主，并有重点的进行政策思想教育，使广大指战员认识到土改政策、城市工商业政策与解放战争的关系。同时由于东北形势的胜利发展，战线迅速南移，防止与纠正懈怠思想偏向亦应为重要教育内容之一。军事教育阶段，以技术为主，战术为辅，军事教育时间占练兵总时间百分之六十，采取反复教学的原则，以射击投弹刺杀技术为先，然后进入爆破夜战等教育。战术教练则以林彪司令员之战术思想及战术动作为主，着重学用一致，使与战场实际经验密切联系，反对形式主义。各部队在训练中并应开展集中领导下的“军事”“政治”“经济”民主运动，以掀起群众性的练兵热潮。
