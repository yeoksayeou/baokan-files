    Gaoling Organizes the Masses for Production and Self-Relief; Work Relief Saves Many
    [News from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area] The democratic government is organizing large-scale transportation and textile production for disaster victims, using work relief, ensuring the livelihood of the people in Gaoling who have been affected by the disaster, and boosting production morale. Since the disaster relief efforts began in Gaoling County, loans totaling 130 million yuan and 160,000 jin of relief grain have been mostly distributed. To prevent the people from consuming all the aid without being able to sustain themselves, the government has organized poor and middle peasants with no other options to transport grain and engage in textile work as a form of work relief. In terms of transportation, priority is given to villages severely affected by the disaster. The daily calculation is based on 60 li, with each 100 jin of transported goods earning 7 to 9 jin of grain. To accommodate poor and middle peasants without carts or livestock, it is stipulated that carrying 100 jin by shoulder earns 10 jin per day, pushing a wheelbarrow earns 6 jin, and pulling with a large cart earns 4 jin. The Finance and Grain Section of the County Government has already transported 870,000 jin of grain, and the masses will receive 69,000 jin of grain. Because the disaster situation in the first and second districts is the most serious, the majority of the transportation is being done by these two districts. Currently, there are 600,000 jin being transported, with the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts participating. De Fengyu, a store of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Branch of the People's Bank in Jingdian, also transported a large amount of grain and relief supplies from Linqing and Neihuang using the work relief method, changing the past practice of only using professional porters, and spending a total of more than 6.73 million yuan in transportation costs. Zhang Yongjin, a poor peasant from Dong Panjing in the second district, transported a load and had more than 20 jin of coarse grains left after eating. He said, "My wife and I can avoid starvation for more than ten days, and I will go transport again later." Xipan Jing Village transported more than 20,000 jin in three trips, earning more than 2,400 jin in transportation fees. Liu Shousen said, "In the past, people in our village all wanted to flee the famine. After getting loans and transporting grain, one person can earn ten taels of grain a day, so we won't starve." The De Fengyu store also plans to transport another 500,000 jin of grain and other supplies from Neihuang. Qingfeng Store also transported 210,000 jin of grain from Neihuang, using 420 wheelbarrows, involving 840 people, and paying a total of about 25,200 jin of grain in transportation fees. It also plans to transport 200,000 jin from Handan. Currently, the masses in the whole county have received a total of 132,134 jin of grain in transportation fees, which, calculated at one jin of grain per disaster victim per day, can sustain 13,213 people for ten days. In terms of organizing textile work, in addition to distributing cotton to the poorest middle peasants and female textile workers, cloth permits are also issued. A total of 30,000 copies have been issued in the county, distributed in two phases. One bolt of cloth is calculated at 25 double-market-feet, and generally those with cloth permits are guaranteed to earn one and a half dou of grain, while those without cloth permits earn one dou. The method of issuing cloth permits is also through self-reporting and public discussion, and the first phase has been distributed and is being used. The Jingdian Market Exchange collects more than 1,100 bolts of cloth per market day, and the back market also collects 500 to 600 bolts, averaging more than 800 bolts per day. Since the disaster relief efforts began, more than 1,187,000 square feet of cloth without cloth permits and more than 100,000 square feet of cloth with cloth permits have been collected. The wife of Zhang Xiujing from Panjing and his sister-in-law both received cloth permits. His sister-in-law exchanged one bolt of cloth for ten jin of cotton, more than one dou of sorghum, and one sheng of beans. She came back happily and said, "We have food to eat and work to do, so we don't have to worry." She and her sister-in-law smiled at the portrait of Chairman Mao and said, "If it weren't for your leadership, we wouldn't know what to do!" Zhang Xiujing's wife interjected, "Look how good Chairman Mao is! He's smiling happily. He's happy that we have food to eat!" Thanks to the support of loans and work relief, the masses' enthusiasm for production and self-relief is gradually increasing.

    高陵组织群众生产自救
    以工代赈救人很多
    【冀鲁豫消息】民主政府大规模组织灾民运输纺织生产，以工代赈，高陵受灾人民生活得到保障，生产情绪提高。高陵县救灾以来，贷款一万万三千万元，救济粮米十六万斤，已大部贷下。为防止吃光用光，政府又组织没办法的贫农中农运输粮食和纺织，以工代赈。运输方面，首先要受灾重的村来做规定。每日按六十里计算，每一百斤可得七斤至九斤粮。为了照顾无小车及牲口的贫农中农，规定人担每百斤一天可得十斤，小车推可得六斤，大车拉得四斤。县府财粮科现已运粮八十七万斤，群众可得粮六万九千斤。因一、二区灾情最严重，绝大部分是这两个区运的。现在正在起运的有六十万斤，有一、二、三、四、五各区分别运送。冀鲁豫区分行在井店的商店德丰玉，也按以工代赈的办法在临清及内黄运来大批粮食及救济物资，并改变了过去只用老脚户的办法，共计出运费六百七十三万余元。二区东潘井贫农张永金运了一趟，除吃净剩二十多斤杂粮。他说：“两口人可以十多天不挨饿了，以后还得去运。”西潘井村运输三次，共运两万余斤，得运费二千四百余斤。刘守森说：“过去俺村都想逃荒，贷款运粮后，一天一人能合十两粮食，饿不死啦。”德丰玉商店还准备由内黄再运粮食等五十万斤。清丰商店也在内黄运来粮食二十一万斤，用小车四百二十辆，合八百四十个人，共约支运费粮二万五千二百斤。还准备由邯郸运来二十万斤。现在全县群众共得运费粮十三万二千一百三十四斤，一个灾民每天按一斤粮食计算，可维持一万三千二百一十三个人十天的生活。在组织纺织方面，除发给最没办法的贫中农纺妇棉花外，并发给布证。全县共发三万份，分两期发下，一个布按二十五双市尺算，一般有布证的保证能赚粮一斗半，没布证的赚一斗。发布证的办法也是经过自报公议，现已发下去一期，开始使用。井店集交易所每集可收一千一百余匹布，背集也收五、六百匹，平均一天收八百余匹。自救灾以来，已收没布证的布一百一十八万七千多方尺，有布证的十万多方尺。潘井张修敬的老婆和他嫂子都领了布证，他嫂子一个布换了十斤花，一斗多高粱，一升豆子，回来很喜欢的说：“有吃的，有做的，不愁了。”她妯娌两个对着毛主席的像笑着说：“要不是你领导俺，还不知道怎着哩！”张修敬的老婆插嘴说：“你看毛主席多好！笑喜喜的，咱有了吃的，他也喜欢啊！”由于贷款和以工代赈的支持，群众生产自救情绪正在逐步提高。
