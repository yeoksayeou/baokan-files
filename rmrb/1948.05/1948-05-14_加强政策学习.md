    Strengthen Policy Learning
    Since the Central Bureau issued instructions to the Taiyue and Taihang District Party Committees on correcting left-leaning adventurism, and instructions on developing industrial and commercial policies, many comrades from various regions have written letters raising numerous questions and requesting answers. This indicates that everyone is concerned about and studying the Party's policies, which is a good phenomenon and should be promoted. However, there are also many comrades whose spirit of conscientious learning is greatly lacking, even to the point of not paying attention to or studying the Party's policies and instructions, as if policy documents have nothing to do with them. They are building cars behind closed doors in their work, continuing to make avoidable mistakes. For example, on the issue of compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords, some places still use the excuse of ideological disagreement or lack of resources to avoid earnestly implementing these policies, putting the Party's policies behind them, persisting in errors, affecting spring plowing and production, and even causing people to starve to death. This phenomenon must be immediately and resolutely corrected. We believe that the current work of correcting deviations is a key to guiding our region's work onto a sound development track. Every comrade, especially leading comrades, must resolutely grasp the policies, so that work can avoid detours and the masses can suffer less. To grasp the policies, it is necessary to conscientiously study and correctly understand them, and to investigate and study the current specific circumstances; without doing so, it will be impossible to adhere to the Party's policies in complex situations and impossible to do a good job. In addition, some of our comrades are only accustomed to running around busily, without being good at combining work with policy learning, distinguishing boundaries ideologically – what mistakes have been made that should be corrected, and what correct things should be adhered to. Everything is simply "cooked in one pot." Even if something is done correctly, they don't know it; if something is done wrong, they don't know it either. This is like "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep abyss in the middle of the night." Doing work in this way is also very dangerous. We must overcome the above shortcomings and strengthen policy learning.

    加强政策学习
    自从中央局对太岳、太行区党委指示纠正左倾冒险主义，发展工商业政策指示等文件发出后，各地工作同志纷纷来信提出很多问题，要求解答，这说明大家都在关心与研究党的政策，这是一种好的现象，应该发扬。但另外也有许多同志，认真学习的精神非常不够，甚至对党的政策与指示不注意，不研究，好象政策文件与他无关。工作上闭门造车，继续发生可以避免的错误。如补偿中农、安置地主问题，有些地方仍借口思想不通或没有东西，不去认真进行，把党的政策置于脑后，坚持错误，影响春耕生产，甚至还饿死人。这种现象，必须立即坚决纠正。我们认为目前纠偏工作，是使我区工作走上健全发展轨道上的一个关键。每个同志，尤其是领导同志必须坚决掌握政策，使工作少走弯路，群众少受痛苦。要掌握政策，就必须认真学习和正确了解政策，并调查研究当前的具体情况；不这样做，就无法在复杂的情况中坚持党的政策，无法把工作做好。另外我们还有些同志，只惯于东跑西跳，忙忙碌碌，而不善于在工作中结合工作进行政策学习，在思想上分清界限，哪点是做错了应该纠正，哪点是正确的应该坚持，反正是“一锅煮”，即便做得正确也不知道，错了也不知道，“盲人骑瞎马，夜半临深渊”，这样做工作也是非常危险的。我们须要克服上述毛病，加强政策学习。
