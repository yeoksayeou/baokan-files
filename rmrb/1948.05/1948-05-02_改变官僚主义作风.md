Changing Bureaucratic Work Style

The rectification of deviations in Jincheng for twenty days still resulted in lip service. Some villages are still continuing to infringe upon the interests of the middle peasants. This demonstrates a lack of seriousness and resoluteness in implementing the Party's policies, as well as a manifestation of liberalism. It shows that the leadership in Jincheng, in terms of production and correcting deviations, has more or less committed the fault of bureaucracy. For example, the struggle against the middle peasants in Wu Village and the borrowing of grain from the middle peasants in Guo Village are both recent events. The County Committee did not know about them or earnestly resolve them before the meeting and report, which is very inappropriate. The County Committee's proposal to go deeper and promote generally is good, but it should not be used as a beautiful slogan to shout; it is necessary to break with bureaucracy, set an example, promptly guide the work of various villages, and take resolute measures against all "leftist" deviations at any time and place, rather than simply relying on meetings and inspections. Only then will it be possible to reverse the thinking of cadres and correct mistakes. The resolution made by the Jincheng County Committee on correcting "leftist" deviations is not complete enough. For example, how to settle the lives of landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of the house and allow them to turn to production is not mentioned at all. It is hoped that this point will also attract attention.

　　改变官僚主义作风
    晋城纠偏二十天，结果仍是停在口头上。有些村至今仍在继续侵犯中农利益。这是对党的政策执行上不严肃，不坚决以及自由主义的表现。说明晋城领导生产和纠正偏向或多或少是犯了官僚主义的毛病。譬如吴庄斗了中农，郭庄向中农借粮都是眼下的事，县委在开会汇报以前，并不知道也没认真解决，这就十分不妥当。县委提出深入一点推动一般是好的，但不应只当一个漂亮口号来叫喊，必须打破官僚主义，做出样子及时指导各村工作，对一切左的偏向都能随时随地采取坚决措施，而不要单纯依靠开会检查；这才有可能扭转干部思想，纠正错误。在纠正左的偏向上，晋城县委所作的决议是不够完整的。譬如已被扫地出门的地主富农如何安置生活使其转入生产，则只字未提，这一点也望能引起注意。
