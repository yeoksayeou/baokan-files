Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Reports from various sources: Laboring people in Western European countries, holding high the banner of struggle for peace, democracy, independence, and bread, commemorated this year's May Day. More than one million laboring people in Paris responded to the call of the French General Confederation of Labor and the French Communist Party, overcame the reactionary forces' desperate sabotage, and held powerful demonstrations. Slogans demanding peace, bread, freedom, and national independence resounded throughout the country. At the Place de la Bastille in Paris, French Communist Party leaders Thorez, Duclos, and Casan, as well as General Confederation of Labor leaders and militant socialist leader Figeat, delivered speeches one after another. Casan commented in L'Humanité on the demonstration, saying: "Paris has never seen a more powerful May Day demonstration than this one. The laboring people of Paris have given the reactionary forces who attempt to split the trade unions a clear lesson." In London, 20,000 laboring people held a May Day demonstration. In Rome, the capital of Italy, 100,000 workers gathered in the People's Square to celebrate May Day. Sainan, representing the World Federation of Trade Unions, paid tribute to the conference. When Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Trade Unions, congratulated the conference on behalf of the Soviet Trade Unions, he was warmly cheered. He said: "The power of workers and peace is much greater than the power of those who want to launch a new war." And he called for "maintaining and strengthening the international solidarity of the laboring people to stop the attempts of the warmongers." Vittorio, secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, called on the laboring people to stand at the forefront in the struggle for the vital interests of the people and national independence, peace, and freedom. Seven hundred thousand workers in Berlin participated in the May Day demonstration called by the Free German Trade Union Federation. Berlin demonstrators held up signs reading "Give the German people unity and peace, freedom and independence." The May Day commemoration, presided over by the Austrian Communist Party and trade unions, was carried out under the slogans of workers' unity, people's democracy, opposition to the American capital's plan to enslave Austria, opposition to the obstruction of the Austrian peace treaty, and demands for an end to the occupation and improved living standards for workers. Workers in Vienna gathered in various centers of the city and then marched towards the parliament, with demonstrations lasting for three hours. Many Social Democratic Party members, disregarding the leadership's ban on joint May Day celebrations with the Communists, joined the marches organized by the Communists. In the Netherlands, despite the authorities' strict prohibition of demonstrations and the intimidation of police and troops, red flags were still flying in Amsterdam and The Hague to celebrate May Day. The slogans "Strive for peace and bread," "Down with the Beel government," "Withdraw from Indonesia," and "Down with plutocratic dictatorship" were heard everywhere. In Brussels, Belgium, 50,000 laboring people held demonstrations under the slogans of all democratic forces fighting for peace and opposing the Marshall Plan.
