Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 6th: Wang Jiyun, the principal of Kaifeng China Middle School, recently abandoned his post and returned to his hometown of Wuzhi in the liberated area. He also brought back two nephews who were studying in the KMT-controlled area, and was welcomed by the local democratic government. According to Wang, "The Kuomintang bandits' newspapers in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou consistently fabricate victory reports, which the people do not believe. After the People's Liberation Army captured Xuchang last winter and Luoyang this spring, the people of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, who had suffered deeply from the persecution of the Kuomintang bandits, were overjoyed and hoped to be liberated soon. The Kuomintang bandits' bureaucrats and their families fled to Nanjing and Shanghai in droves." He also said, "Prices in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are rising rapidly, and public school teachers are starving. Many students have returned to their liberated hometowns to participate in democratic construction work. An increasing number of people near the two isolated cities of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, including even Baos and Jia chiefs, are fleeing due to the excessive levies imposed by the Kuomintang bandits."

　　开封中国中学校长
  　王际云投奔我区
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】开封中国中学校长王际云于日前弃职返回解放区武陟原籍，他并带回在蒋管区上学的两个侄子，当受当地民主政府欢迎。据王氏说：“蒋匪开封郑州报纸一贯伪造胜利战报，人民都不相信，去冬解放军攻克许昌及今春解放洛阳后，深受蒋匪迫害的郑州开封人民莫不人心大快，都期望早日获得解放，蒋匪官僚及眷属则纷纷逃往南京上海”。他并说：“郑州开封物价赛跑上升，公教人员都在挨饿，已有不少学生返回解放了的家乡参加民主建设工作。郑州开封两孤城附近民众甚至保甲长为蒋匪过重的摊派逼迫而潜逃的亦日益众多。”
