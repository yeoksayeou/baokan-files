　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Rome Dispatch: The inaugural meeting of the new Italian parliament is scheduled to open on the 8th. Italy's democratic and reactionary camps have launched a fierce struggle over the candidates for president and speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Christian Democratic Party is attempting to seize these three important positions and is openly attacking the current president, Nicola, forcing him to abandon his candidacy and instead promoting Gasperi's docile slave, Sforza (Republican), as a presidential candidate. The Executive Committee of the People's Democratic Front recently decided to form three parliamentary groups consisting of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and a mixed group (composed of other parties of the People's Democratic Front) for the senators and representatives representing the Front. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti declared that the issue of the Front's candidate for president of the republic falls within the purview of the Front's parliamentary group, but he personally believes that "not participating in the presidential election would be an effective political action, an action that would powerfully demonstrate to the people of the country the Front's protest against the violation of the Italian people's freedom of will." Togliatti also criticized the proposal of Sforza as a presidential candidate, saying: "We must not allow a 'clown who lacks the spirit and qualities of a citizen of the republic and is wearing an American uniform' to serve as the head of the republic."

　　意民主与反动两大阵营
  　展开竞选总统斗争
    【新华社陕北十二日电】罗马讯：意大利新议会首届会议决于八日揭幕，意民主与反动两大阵营对总统及参众两议长候选人问题，已展开激烈的斗争。基督教民主党企图夺取这三个重要职位，并公开攻击现总统尼古拉，迫其放弃候选，而抬出加斯贝利的驯服奴隶史佛卓（共和党）为总统候选人。人民民主阵线执委会近已决定将代表该阵线的众参议员，分别组成共产党、社会党和混合集团（按由人民民主阵线其他政党组成）三个国会党团。意共领袖托格里亚蒂宣称：该阵线之共和国总统候选人问题，属于该阵线国会党团的职权范围，但他个人认为：“不参加总统选举，将是一有效的政治行动，这一行动能在国人面前，有力地表明了该阵线对侵犯意人民表达其自由意志的抗议。”托氏并抨击提出史佛卓为总统候选人，他说：决不能让“缺乏共和国公民应有的精神和品质以及穿着美国制服的小丑”来充当共和国的元首。
