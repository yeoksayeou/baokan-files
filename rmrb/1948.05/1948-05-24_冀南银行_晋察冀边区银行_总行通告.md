　　Jinan Bank
    Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank
    General Office Notice
    It has been found that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Lusi Bank banknotes were issued in the Northwest Shandong area and circulated uniformly in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to unify the currency and facilitate merchants and the people, it was announced in July of last year that the banknotes would be recovered at par with the Ji banknotes within six months. It has now been found that a small number of these banknotes are still circulating in the market. Therefore, it is hereby announced again to merchants and the people that those holding Lusi Bank banknotes should quickly exchange them at the local Jinan Bank or Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank (one to one against Ji banknotes, and one to ten against Border Region banknotes) so that they can be recovered as soon as possible. This is hereby announced.

    总行通告
    查抗日时期我鲁西北地区曾发行鲁西银行钞票，于抗日胜利后统一流通于晋冀鲁豫地区。为了统一货币，便利商民，曾于去年七月间公布限六个月以冀钞等值收回。兹查此项钞票尚有少数流通市面，为此特再通告商民凡持有鲁西银行之钞票者，希速向当地之冀南银行或晋察冀边区银行兑换（对冀钞一对比、边钞一比十），以便早日收回。特此通告
