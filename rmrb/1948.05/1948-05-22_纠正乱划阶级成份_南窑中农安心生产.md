Correcting Random Classifications
　Nanyao Middle Peasants Reassured and Producing

　　[Changzhi News] On the night of April 30th, Nanyao Village in the Fifth District held a cadre meeting to investigate the reasons for the lack of enthusiasm in spring plowing. Li Yuangen, the Director of Civil Education, said: "Alas! To be honest, the main reason why our village is not producing enthusiastically is that the last class classification wrongly categorized a middle-peasant household as a rich peasant, and everyone is frightened. Take me for example, I used to be very active in my work. After being classified as a rich peasant in the first month, I just waited to be struggled against every day. If I work actively, I'm afraid the masses will say I'm taking advantage; if I don't, I'm afraid the superiors will say I'm lying down and not working, making mistakes on top of mistakes. I really feel uneasy every day. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that past mistakes in struggling against middle peasants should be resolutely compensated, and that class classification should not be based on three generations but on whether there is exploitation. This has made me feel a little more at ease. But I always think that others can do it, but my land is good, but it's always no use." Mutual Aid Team Leader ×× said: "In the past, these eleven households were all middle peasants and even shared the fruits of struggle. Now, according to three generations, they have all been classified as rich peasants. They didn't even eat during the famine years and almost starved to death. Every winter, they rely on working in kilns to earn wages to cover miscellaneous expenses, but now they have become rich peasants. Who dares to produce again?" Ma Xingze said: "The main reason is that the class classification classified me as a prosperous middle peasant. I thought that after struggling against these eleven households, it would be my turn to be struggled against. If I work, I'm afraid they will say I am protecting my property, so I am not leading the work." After being classified as a rich peasant, Li Xinglao lay at home for several days and told others: "If I were still among the middle peasants, I would dare to say anything. Not only would I produce well, but I would also like to buy another animal; now that I have been made a rich peasant, even my mule's leg (one-sixth share) has to be sold!"

　　After discovering these problems, a mass meeting of more than seventy people was held the next night. First, it was explained that it was wrong for Meitianbu Village to classify classes casually. Secondly, the five guarantees of uniting with middle peasants were explained, and the criteria for class classification were explained, based on the individual's possession of land, means of production, and whether there was exploitation, not tracing back three generations, and that no other conditions could be used as a standard. Everyone argued: "If that's the case, these eleven households are not rich peasants." After the meeting, everyone went to the mutual aid teams and meal halls to discuss. After three days, the masses in each group said that the classification was wrong, and the mutual aid team leaders conveyed this (because the masses were busy planting and did not hold a meeting), stating that the eleven households previously classified as rich peasants were not rich enough and must be resolutely corrected. In this way, the eleven households were emotionally stable in the mutual aid team, and the masses, especially the middle peasants, became actively engaged in production. Zheng Xiaohu's team spent another 2.7 million yuan to buy a mule. Currently, 265 mu of valley land have been planted (there are still 21 mu unplanted), 115 mu of corn and sorghum, and 4 mu of indigo.

　　纠正乱划阶级成份
  　南窑中农安心生产
    【长治消息】五区南窑村四月三十日夜召开干部会议，研究春耕工作不起劲的原因。民教主任李元根说：“唉！我实说吧，咱村生产不起劲，主要是上次划阶级把一户中农划成富农，大家都害了怕。拿我来说，过去我对工作很积极，正月把我划成富农后，我就每天等着挨斗。工作积极干吧，怕群众说我是钻空；不干吧，又怕上级说我躺倒不干，错上加错。实在每天心里不安。最近我又看到报上的消息，过去错斗中农坚决补偿，划阶级不追三代，是看有无剥削。这样我又稍安心了。但总想着别人能行，我种的地好，总是不行。”互助组长××说：“过去这十一户都是中农，还分斗争果实哩。现在按三辈把他们都划成了富农，灾荒年都没吃，几乎饿死，每年冬天都是靠下窑赚工资顾零开支，现在都成了富农啦，谁还敢再生产哩？”马幸则说：“我主要也是因为划阶级把我划成富裕中农，我想斗了他们这十一户，就轮着斗我啦。工作吧，怕说我是为了保护我的财产，因此我也不领导工作了。”李兴劳被划为富农后，就在家躺了数天，和别人说：“我要还在中农里，我什么也敢说，不但好好生产，我还想再买个牲口哩；现在把我弄到富农，连我这条骡子腿（六分之一）还要卖了哩！”
    发现这些问题后，第二天夜就召开群众会，参加有七十余人，首先讲明没填补村随便划阶级是不对的。其次讲明团结中农的五项保证，又说明划阶级标准，是根据本人占有土地生产资料及有无剥削关系，不追三代，其他任何条件也都不能为准。大家咯吵：“要这样说，这十一户都不够富农。”会后由大家又到互助组和饭场讨论。经过三天，各组群众都说是划错了，便由互助组长传达下去（因群众忙下种没有开会），说明上次划的十一户富农都不够，坚决纠正。这样，这十一户在互助组里情绪安定了，群众特别是中农也积极生产起来。郑小虎组又花了二十七万元买骡子一头。现在谷地已下种二六五亩（未下种还有二十一亩），玉茭、高粱一一五亩，蓝四亩。（张放田）
