    Why Restrict the Development of New Cloth Shops?
    Please Guangping County Investigate
    To the Editors:
    On April 28th, the County Government's Industry and Commerce Bureau sent Comrade Ma Futang, Director of the Trading Center, as a representative, implementing a new policy regarding newly established cloth shops, the content of which is as follows:
    Regarding the issue of new cloth shops, we are resolutely against allowing any further development. In order to facilitate control and management of the market, there must be restrictions on cloth shops, and the specific regulations for restriction and reduction are as follows: 1. Among these three or four new cloth shops, apart from Gongji Cloth Shop, which has already obtained a business license and is permitted to operate, all others must find partners to merge with existing cloth shops. 2. If existing cloth shops do not agree to merge, they can apply to the government for instructions, which may include permission to join the county-run local cloth cooperative or be ordered to change professions. The implementation of the above policy means that free development is not allowed.
    On September 13th of last year, the Border Region Government promulgated the Outline Land Law, Article 12 of which clearly stipulates to expand and develop industry and commerce as much as possible, and provide legal protection and support. The county and districts have also issued announcements and instructions to expand private commerce and protect the interests of merchants. Now, I don't know why, the freedom of commercial trade is suddenly suspended, and an instruction of commercial restriction is issued? The Border Region Government's laws and regulations require the expansion of commerce as much as possible, which is unrestricted, but now Guangping County commerce is to be restricted. Can the County Committee or the Government arbitrarily delete or modify the policies and laws of higher authorities? What is the basis for the new instructions of Guangping County? Are there any special circumstances in Guangping County that allow for flexibility? Or is this a decision made by the County Industry and Commerce Bureau? Or is it a decision made by the County Committee of the Government? I hope the responsible comrades of the Guangping Industry and Commerce Bureau will conduct an investigation and reply.

### 为何限制新布店发展？  请广平县检查

    为何限制新布店发展？
    请广平县检查编辑同志：
    四月二十八号，县政府工商局派交易总所主任马福堂同志为代表，对于新设的布店又变了一个新政策，内容如下：
    关于新布店的问题，坚决不承认再有一家进行发展的。为了便利掌握市场与管理，所以布店要有限制的，并指出限制与缩小的规定法：一、在这三四家新布店内，除了公记布店一家已领出营业证准许经营外，一概令其各寻对象与旧布店合并。二、旧布店不同意合并时，可向政府申请，听其指示，或准许参加县立土布合作社，或令转业，当执行上级政令，不准自由发展。
    去年九月十三日，边府所颁布的实行土地法大纲内，第十二条有明确规定，尽量扩大发展工商业，加以合法的保护与扶助，县区都有颁发的扩大私人商业、保障商人利益的布告与指示。现在不知为啥，忽然中止商业贸易自由，出了一个商业有限制的指示？边府法令要尽量扩大商业，是无限制的，而广平县商业现在要有限制，是否上级的政策法令县委或政府可以擅自删改呢？广平县的新指示，是根据什么规定的？广平县是否有特殊情形可以灵活机动呢？还是县工商局决定的呢？还是政府县委会决定的？我希望广平工商局负责同志予以检查答复。
