　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu on the 22nd] The Administrative Office has allocated grain and funds to repair the Wen River, the Grand Canal, and the Daqing and Xiaoqing Rivers in order to alleviate the flooding in Dongping and Juye, and to remove the threat of the Juye dangerous works. The Juye dangerous works are not only the largest and most dangerous project on the Yellow River, but its geographical environment is also extremely harsh, often threatened by water from all sides. To its southwest, during the continuous rainy season of summer and autumn, the rainwater from Juye pours in from Huanghuasi; to the east, Dongping County has crisscrossing rivers, and coupled with Dongping Lake, it is a region plagued by floods year-round. This water not only causes great suffering to the people of Dongping and Juye, but also directly threatens the Juye dangerous works on the Yellow River. This is because every summer and autumn, the rainwater from the Lai Meng Mountains flows backward into the Wen River. When the water in the Wen River reaches the Daicun Dam on the eastern border of Dongping, 30% of the flow crosses the Daicun dam and flows into the Daqing River (also called the Yan River), and 70% flows southwest to Nanwang Town (also called the Water Diversion Ridge) in Wenshang and enters the Grand Canal. After entering the Grand Canal, it splits north and south, with the northern flow entering Dongping Lake at Anshan Town in Juye County. Rainwater from the Pingfei Mountains enters the Daqing River via the Hui River, and then enters Dongping Lake via the Daqing and Xiaoqing Rivers. The water of the Wen River, after crossing the Daicun Dam, diverts at Longjie in the fifth district of Dongping, with the northern branch being the Daqing River and the southern branch being the Xiaoqing River. All the waters converge into Dongping Lake and then enter the Yellow River through Qinghemen. However, Qinghemen is often blocked by the sediment of the Yellow River, preventing the lake water from being discharged. In addition, the Wen River flows down from the mountains, making each rainy season particularly fierce, with a flow rate reaching 8,000 cubic meters per second. Therefore, every rainy season, Dongping and Juye are in a state of alarm, with breaches occurring almost every year, causing continuous flooding. In particular, a breach on the southern bank of the Grand Canal puts the Juye dangerous works in a precarious position. The Wen River, the Grand Canal, and the Qing River have always been repaired by the people, but due to the repeated exploitation and looting by the Chiang bandits, the vast majority of people's lives have long been extremely difficult. This year, river management requires an expenditure of over one million jin of rice. The Administrative Office, mindful of the people's hardships, has made the following decisions: (1) The Wen River and the Qing River will still be repaired by the people. In order to take care of the difficulties of the local people, the democratic government will allocate 430,000 jin of rice to Juye, 415,551 jin of rice to Dongping, 683,286 yuan, 154,605 jin of firewood, 343,170 jin of grass, and 564,890 jin of straw as river management expenses. (2) In the spirit of reducing flooding, Dongping will not carry out major repairs, but will only repair the dams and embankments of each river and dangerous works. The upper and lower mouths of the Xiaoqing River will be completely blocked, so that the water from the Wen River and the Grand Canal will all flow into the Daqing River, concentrating efforts on defending the Daqing River. (3) Juye will block the two breaches in the Grand Canal opened by the Chiang bandits last year near Jinkou (one breaching north and one breaching south), pave the embankment west of Anshan Town with protective stones to resist the impact of Dongping Lake water, and build a levee on the west bank of Dongping Lake to prevent the lake water from flowing westward. (Note: 8,000 cubic meters per second is a term for river water flow, meaning that 8,000 cubic meters of water flows per second. Last year, the maximum flow of the Yellow River was no more than 15,000 cubic meters per second.)

　　冀鲁豫行署决定兴修汶运河
  　解除昆山险工威胁
  　体念民艰拨米八十万斤协助
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】行署拨粮款修治汶河、运河及大小清河，以减轻东平、＠山的水患，和解除＠山险工的威胁。按＠山险工不但是黄河上最大最险的工程，而且它所处的地理环境也极恶劣，常在四面受水的威胁中。在它的西南方，到夏秋雨水连绵的季节，鄄城一带的雨水便由黄花寺倾泄而来；东面之东平县，则河流交错，再加上东平湖，更是常年闹水灾的地区。这些水不但常给了东平和＠山一带人民以极大的痛苦，而且直接威胁着黄河上的＠山险工，这是因为每年夏秋时莱蒙山区的雨水倒灌入汶河。汶河至东平东边境的戴村坝，水大时即有十分之三的流量越过戴村拦水坝而灌入大清河（也叫盐河），十分之七的流量往西南流至汶上的南旺镇（也叫分水岭）入运河。入运河后，北南分流，北流的至＠山县的安山镇入东平湖。平肥山区的雨水则由汇河入大清河，经大小清河入东平湖。汶河的水越过戴村坝后，至东平五区的龙碣分流，北股即大清河，南股为小清河。各水汇流到东平湖后，再由清河门入黄河。但清河门常被黄河的混沙闭塞致湖水宣泄不出去，加以汶水由山区倒灌而下，每次雨水涨发时，来势特别凶猛，流量竟达到八千秒立方，因而每年雨水涨发时，东平和＠山一带都是到处告警，几乎每年决口，闹得连年水灾，而尤其运河南岸一决口，＠山险工便陷于背面受敌的危境。汶、运、清等河，向来是归民修，但因多次蒋匪的压榨抢掠，绝大多数人民的生活早已困苦不堪，而今年治河须开支米百余万斤，行署体念民艰，特作如下决议：（一）汶、清等河仍归民修，民主政府为了照顾当地人民的困苦，除拨给＠山四十三万斤米，并拨给东平米四十一万五千五百五十一斤，款六十八万三千二百八十六元，柴一十五万四千六百零五斤，草三十四万三千一百七十斤，秸料五十六万四千八百九十斤，以为治河费用。（二）在减少水灾精神下，东平不进行大复，只修治各河各险工的坝埽，并将小清河的上口与下口全部堵死，以便使汶河过来的水及运河的水都流入大清河，集中力量防守大清河。（三）＠山堵死去年蒋匪在靳口一带打开的两个运河决口（一向北决一向南决），在安山镇西的运堤加铺护沿石，以抗东平湖水的冲击，井筑东平湖西岸堤，以防湖水西倾。（附注：八千秒立方，是河水流量名词，即每一秒钟水流过八千立方公尺，去年黄河水最大时，不超过一万五千秒立方。）
