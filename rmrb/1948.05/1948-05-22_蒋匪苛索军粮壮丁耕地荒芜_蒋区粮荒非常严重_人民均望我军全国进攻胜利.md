Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Comprehensive report: The grain shortage in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has now entered a severe stage. Last year, the rice harvest in the area decreased by 33% compared to normal years, and wheat decreased even more drastically by 40%. Compared with the minimum required amount, each is short by more than 60 million piculs. Now is the time between harvests, and grain prices are rising sharply. The price of rice in Shanghai from the beginning of January to the 12th of this month has risen from 1 million (KMT currency, same below) to 6.4 million per picul, an increase of 5.5 times, and 3.5 times higher than the same period last year, showing a sharp acceleration trend. Nanjing reached 5.8 million on the 8th of this month. In Tianjin, flour reached 2.45 million per bag on April 20th. As early as late March in Qingdao, rice had risen to more than 50,000 per jin, and flour more than 60,000. In Taiyuan, millet reached an astonishing height of 14.5 million per picul on April 8th. In Xiamen, rice reached the 5 million mark per picul in early April. Rice prices in Fuzhou, Chaozhou-Shantou, Guangzhou, Guilin, and even the rice-producing areas of Changsha, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Chongqing have all skyrocketed. Amidst the grain shortage, in Shanghai, the number of poor people who starved to death, only the bodies collected by the Tongshan Hall charity in the city in the first three months of this year, reached more than 7,300. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially in rural areas, the phenomenon of people starving to death is unprecedentedly serious.

Two major factors have caused the current grain shortage in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The first is the Kuomintang's mad plunder of peasants: From 1946 to 1947, under the guise of land tax, requisition, borrowing, and "military grain procurement," more than 69 million piculs of grain were extorted from the people. This (i.e., 1947-48) year, it was decided to collect 80 million piculs, and "procure military grain" of 3 million large packages in the four provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi at "official prices" (only 170,000 per picul of rice), which were dozens of times lower than market prices, and the "procurement" in the ten provinces of Taiwan, Kang, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong was not included. The extortion by local governments at all levels is even more severe. For example, in Chahar, in addition to the 160,000 piculs of land tax "quota" extorted by the bandit Fu Zuoyi last year, another 128,000 piculs of "provincial public grain" and 160,000 piculs of "county public grain" were levied, and the military grain levied only to supply the Northeast, Baoding, and Laishui reached 700,000 piculs, and the number purchased at low prices for the use of the Kuomintang army reached 2.2 million piculs. Various apportionments in the Kuomintang-controlled areas generally account for the vast majority of farmers' income from farming. Even the Central News Agency of the bandits admitted that in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan, most farmers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas do not have enough income to pay grain taxes throughout the year. The second is that Chiang Kai-shek bandits maintain - and cannot but continue to maintain - the feudal exploitation system as the social foundation of their counter-revolutionary rule. In the Chiang Kai-shek bandit-controlled areas, landlords and rich peasants, who account for less than 10% of the population, own 70% to 80% of the land and extract land rent from peasants, accounting for 50% to 70% of the total harvest. The dual exploitation of the Kuomintang government and the landlord class has deprived peasants of their ability to reproduce. The number of people abandoning cultivated land is increasing day by day: in the three counties of Hengyang, Lingling, and Qiyang in Hunan, a famous rice-producing area, the wasteland reached more than 670,000 mu last year, accounting for a quarter of the total cultivated land; according to the official confession of the Kuomintang-controlled area of Hebei: the wasteland reached 2.8 million mu; the senators of Yan Xishan bandits even said that the wasteland in the Yan Xishan area of central Shanxi reached nine-tenths. Even those who are still maintaining production, the farming methods and the degree of application are becoming increasingly crude, which has led to a sharp reduction in agricultural production in the Chiang-controlled areas. Now is the spring plowing season, and peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas are unable to carry out the planting of cultivated land because their food, seeds, and livestock have been plundered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the rural labor force has either been conscripted or displaced by fleeing military service and harsh duties. Therefore, the agricultural economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will inevitably tend to develop further.

The widespread hunger that the grain shortage has brought to the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is forcing them to rise up in a struggle to save themselves. At present, this struggle has gradually increased. The urban and rural hungry people are forced to carry out rice-grabbing riots, including Wuhu and Chengdu in the rice-producing areas, and the anti-hunger movement in academic and other fields is also advancing with each passing day. The unprecedented awakening of the people has greatly panicked the bandit gang. In a proposal passed by the pseudo-National Congress on the 22nd of last month, they wailed: "Looking back at our area (referring to the Kuomintang-controlled area), 70% of the poor are bewitched by the 'bandits' (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's slander of the Chinese Communist Party) and look forward to the 'Communist bandits' coming early to share the benefits." The broad masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are now pinning their hopes on the victory of the People's Liberation Army's nationwide offensive.

　　蒋匪苛索军粮壮丁耕地荒芜
  　蒋区粮荒非常严重
    人民均望我军全国进攻胜利
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：国民党统治区粮荒，现已步入严重阶段。去年该区稻谷收获量较常年激减三成三，小麦更激减四成，与最低需要量相较，各不敷六千万市担以上，现当青黄不接时期，粮价更急剧飞涨。上海一月初至本月十二日的米价，每担已由匪币（下同）一百万涨至六百四十万，上涨五倍半，较去年同时期上涨三倍半，呈现猛烈的加速度涨势。南京本月八日已达五百八十万。天津四月二十日面粉每袋亦达二百四十五万。青岛早在三月下旬大米每斤已涨到五万多，面粉六万多。太原四月八日小米每担更达一千四百五十万的惊人高度。厦门四月初大米每担已登五百万大关。福州、潮汕、广州、桂林以至产米区的长沙、武汉、成都、重庆米价无不暴涨。在粮荒中，上海饿死的贫民，仅该市慈善团体同善堂今年头三个月收葬的尸体，即达七千三百余具。在国民党统治区，特别是农村，饿死人的现象空前严重。
    两个重大因素造成了目前国民党统治区的粮荒，第一是国民党对农民的疯狂掠夺：一九四六至四七年以田赋征实征借及“征购军粮”等名目，向人民勒榨了六千九百多万担粮食；本（即一九四七至四八）年度又决定征收八千万担，并以低于市价数十倍的“官价”（每担稻谷仅十七万元），在川湘鄂赣四省“采购军粮”三百万大包，而在台、康、豫、陕、甘、绥、宁、冀、晋、鲁十省“采购”者尚不在内。各级地方政府的勒索更为苛重，如察哈尔傅匪去年征田赋“正额”十六万担外，又随赋带征“省公粮”十二万八千担，“县公粮”十六万担，加征军粮仅供给东北、保定、涞水三地者即达七十万担，低价购充国民党军支用者更达二百二十万担。国民党统治区内各种摊派一般占农民种地所得的绝大部分，即匪中央社亦曾供认，在苏鲁豫边境，国民党统治区大多数农民，全年收入尚不够完粮纳税。第二是蒋匪维持着——而且不能不继续维持封建剥削制度，作为其反革命统治的社会基础。在蒋匪统治区，人口不到百分之十的地主富农，占有百分之七十到八十的土地，并向农民榨取着占全收获量百分之五十到七十的地租；国民党政府与地主阶级的双管齐下的榨取，已剥夺了农民进行再生产的能力。耕地抛荒者日多：著名产米区湖南衡阳、零陵、祁阳三县去年荒地达六十七万余亩，占全耕地四分之一；河北国民党统治区荒地据匪官方供认：达二百八十万亩；阎匪参议员甚至说晋中阎区荒地达十分之九。即尚在维持生产的，耕作法与施工程度亦日益粗陋，这就造成了蒋区农产的激减。现当春耕时节，蒋区农民因食粮、种籽、牲畜被蒋匪掠夺罄尽，农村劳动力或被抓丁、或因逃避兵役及苛杂而流离四方，耕地播种多无法进行。因此国民党统治区农业经济危机，势将愈趋发展。
    粮荒加给国民党统治区人民的普遍饥饿，正迫使他们奋起作救死求生的斗争，目前这个斗争已渐趋高涨，城乡饥民被迫进行抢米骚动者，及于产米区的芜湖与成都，而学界及其他各界的反饥饿运动亦与日俱进。人民的空前觉悟，已使匪帮大为恐慌，伪国大于上月二十二日通过的一个提案中即哀鸣：“反观我区（指国民党统治区），百分之七十穷人受‘匪’（按系蒋匪帮对中国共产党的诬称）蛊惑，日盼‘共匪’早来，得以分甘沾惠”。国民党统治区广大人民现正寄其希望于人民解放军在全国进攻的胜利。
