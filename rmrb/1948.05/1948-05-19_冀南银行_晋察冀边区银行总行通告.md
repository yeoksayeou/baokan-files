    Jinnan Bank
    Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank
    Head Office Announcement

    It has been found that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Luxi Bank notes were issued in the northwest of Shandong province and were circulated in the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu area after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to unify the currency and facilitate merchants and people, it was announced in July of last year that the notes would be recalled at an equal value to Jichaopiao (冀钞) within six months. It has now been found that there are still a small number of these notes circulating in the market. Therefore, we hereby announce again to merchants and people that those who hold Luxi Bank notes should quickly exchange them at the local Jinnan Bank or the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank (at a rate of one to one with Jichaopiao, and one to ten with Bianchao (边钞)) in order to recall them as soon as possible. This is hereby announced.

    总行通告
    查抗日时期我鲁西北地区曾发行鲁西银行钞票，于抗日胜利后统一流通于晋冀鲁豫地区。为了统一货币，便利商民，曾于去年七月间公布限六个月以冀钞等值收回。兹查此项钞票尚有少数流通市面，为此特再通告商民凡持有鲁西银行之钞票者，希速向当地之冀南银行或晋察冀边区银行兑换（对冀钞一比一、对边钞一比十），以便早日收回。特此通告
