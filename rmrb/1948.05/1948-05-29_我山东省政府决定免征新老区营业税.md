Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th—The Shandong Provincial Government recently issued a proclamation deciding to exempt all new and old liberated areas from business tax for the 37th year of the Republic of China. This decision has been particularly praised by the industrial and commercial circles of Weifang City (newly established provincial-level city, from the county seat to Fangzi Town), which was liberated not long ago. In the past, under the burden of more than thirty kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, many industrial and commercial enterprises had been brutally strangled. The industrial and commercial enterprises in the old liberated areas towns are also in urgent need of recovery and restoration due to the devastation suffered during last year's Chiang Kai-shek bandit offensive.

　　我山东省政府决定免征新老区营业税
    【新华社华东二十六日电】山东省政府日前发出布告，决定所有新老解放区民国三十七年度之营业税一律免征，此一决定，特别为获得解放不久的潍坊市（新设省辖市，自县城至坊子镇一带）工商业界所赞颂。该地前在蒋匪三十余种苛杂重压下，已有不少工商业惨遭绞杀。老解放区各城镇工商业亦因去年遭受蒋匪进攻浩劫，亟待恢复生息。
