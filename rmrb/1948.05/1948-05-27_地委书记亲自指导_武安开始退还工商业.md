District Committee Secretary Personally Guides
Wu'an Begins Returning Industry and Commerce

To the Editor:
　　The article "Wu'an Seriously Damages Industry and Commerce" published in the People's Daily on the 15th of this month is completely factual. However, the first sentence in the article, "The Sixth Inspection Group of the Taihang District Clearance Committee has made a preliminary inspection of Wu'an's implementation of the Party's policy on industry and commerce," is not consistent with the facts. Wu'an's return of industry and commerce began on April 10th, under the leadership of Zhang Huiru, Secretary of the District Committee, and Zhang Hanlin, County Chief of Wu'an, who conducted in-depth research. Later, the cadres were divided into three groups to work in each street: County Chief Zhang Hanlin and Branch Secretary Guo Peiwen led a group to experiment in Second Street; the second group was an investigation team, specializing in investigating the losses of industry and commerce; and another group of cadres went to each street to publicize policies and guide production. A week later, the investigation team summarized and studied the investigation situation. Comrade Feng from the Taihang District Clearance Committee also participated in the report of the investigation situation. After listening to the report, he organized the materials. This inspection was done by the Wu'an Chengguan District Working Group. In addition, after the experiment in Second Street, all commerce had been returned. Since the 6th of this month, the return has been generally carried out in the remaining fourteen streets of the entire Chengguan District except for First Street. Because of the lack of district cadres, eleven cadres were transferred from the County Committee, County Government and other organs to participate. The situation of the return in Second Street is reported as follows:

　　Chengguan Second Street: In the first ten days of this month, five businesses, including Heshenghao, Yuxingheng, Tongmaohao, Xinhua Pool, and Victory Car Dealership, which were confiscated in the May movement last year, were returned, with a capital of 4.95 million yuan, and profits of 8.638685 million yuan earned in the past six months, all returned. A joint meeting of more than 20 people, including old owners, new managers, shop employee representatives, and street cadres, was convened for the return. At the meeting, the chairman of the Poor People's Association and the Chengguan Branch Secretary first made a public review of the wrongful struggle against industry and commerce and the violation of the policy on industry and commerce, and then explained the Party's policy on protecting industry and commerce. Then, everyone was allowed to discuss specific issues in the return. The old shareholder, Li Decun, said, "It's easy to return. Just count the goods. How many goods did you receive from me, and how many should be returned to me?" The new manager and cadre representatives all said, "It's better to calculate the accounts. The business has made money, and the principal and interest should be returned. Take Tongmaohao as an example. The goods were valued at 2.45 million yuan when they were confiscated. The business has made a lot of money in the past six months, and the profit is still 1.16 million yuan. If you return as much as you confiscated, the original owner will suffer too much. All should be returned, and we cannot profit from it." After discussion, several issues in the return were determined: (1) Valuation of goods: Some of the fruits of struggle of the Poor People's Association were invested in the business. Heshenghao alone invested 1.3 million yuan. The goods must be valued before the accounts can be settled and dividends distributed. After everyone's discussion, the goods were uniformly priced according to the market price. The prices of goods have risen and fallen: for example, paint was 40,000 yuan per barrel when it was confiscated, and now it is 20,000 yuan; but some goods have also risen in price. It is fair to average the price according to the market price. Everyone is satisfied, and they say it is a win-win-win situation. Old shareholders, the Poor People's Association, and staff and shop employees (because staff and shop employees also get dividends) are all satisfied. (2) The employment of staff and shop employees by shops is negotiated voluntarily by both parties, and the government will never appoint them. Wages are also determined voluntarily by both parties, so that capitalists can profit and shop employees can have food to eat. Return method: Four return teams were organized according to the shops, consisting of an old shareholder, a new manager, one cadre, one representative from each industry, and shop employees. Business is conducted during the day, and goods are counted and accounts are settled at night. Now all the business has been cleared, the old shareholders have changed to the original shops, and they are officially in business. (Wu'an Joint Office Zhang Yiying)

Comrade Yiying:

　　Your letter informs us that Wu'an City has begun to correct the deviation, and there are responsible comrades leading it, which is very good. The previous report on Wu'an's damage to industry and commerce was rewritten based on the copied materials from the Sixth Inspection Group of the Taihang Clearance Committee. Because the copied materials were marked with words such as "Preliminary Inspection of Wu'an's Implementation of the Party's Policy on Industry and Commerce." The material was stamped with the seal of the "Sixth Inspection Group of the Taihang Clearance Committee," and the article did not mention comrades such as Zhang Huiru, Secretary of the District Committee, and Zhang Hanlin, County Chief of Wu'an. Therefore, after reading it, we believed that the inspection of Wu'an's policy on industry and commerce was done by the Sixth Inspection Group of the Taihang Clearance Committee. In the editor's note, we hoped that the leading comrades of Wu'an would express their attitude towards this inspection.

### 地委书记亲自指导　武安开始退还工商业

专栏：

　　地委书记亲自指导
  　武安开始退还工商业编辑同志：
    本月十五号，人民日报发表的武安严重损害工商业一稿，情况完全真实。但文中第一句说：“太行区清委会第六检查小组对武安执行党的工商业政策做了初步检查，”这句话不符合事实。武安退还工商业，四月十号就已开始着手进行，这一工作首先有地委书记张慧如、武安县长张汉林领导，作了深刻研究。后把干部分成三部分到各街进行：县长张汉林与分书郭佩文领导一组在二街试验；二组是调查组，专门调查损害工商业损失情况；还有一部分干部分头到各街宣传政策，领导生产。一礼拜后，调查组把调查情况总结研究。在汇报调查情况时，太行区清委会冯同志也参加，他听了汇报以后，把材料整理了一下。这个检查，是武安城关区工作小组做的。另外，二街经过试验，商业已全部退还，从本月六号，全城关区除一道街没有进行，其余十四个街普遍的着手退还。因为区干部缺少，又从县委会、县政府等机关抽调十一个干部参加。兹将二街退还情形报导如下：
    城关二街：本月上旬退还了去年五月运动没收的和顺号、豫兴恒、同茂号、新华池、胜利车行等五家，资金四百九十五万，和半年来赚的红利八百六十三万八千六百八十五元，全部退还。退时召开了旧东掌、新经理、店员代表、街干部等廿余人的联席会议，会议首先有贫民会主席与城关分书把错斗工商业、违背工商业政策作了公开检查，又讲解了党对保护工商业的政策。然后让大家讨论退还中的具体问题。旧股东李德存说：“这好退，把货点一下，你们接收了我多少货，还退还我多少”。新经理和干部代表们都说：“还是算一下帐好，生意都赚了钱，应该把本利都退还。象同茂号吧，没收时货物折价二百四十五万元，半年来生意赚钱很多，货顶货，红利还有一百一十六万。没收多少退多少，原主太吃亏，要退都得退还，我们不能从中取利”。讨论结果，确定了退还中的几个问题：（一）货物作价：生意里入有贫民会一部分斗争果实，光和顺号就入有一百三十万，货物必须作成价才能结帐分红。经大家讨论，货物一律按市价来作。货物有涨有落：比如颜料吧，没收时每桶四万元，现二万元；但也有的货物涨了价。一律平均按市价比较公道。大家都不吃亏，他们说是三全其美。旧股东、贫民会、职员店员（因职员店员也分红）都满意。（二）店铺雇用职员店员，由双方自愿接洽，政府决不委派。工资也由双方自愿确定，一方面使资本家有利可图，一方面使店员有饭吃。退还办法：按商铺组织了四个退还小组，由旧股东，新经理，干部一人，各行业代表一人及本号店员组成。白天营业，夜里点货算帐。现在生意全部交清，旧股东改为原来商号，正式营业。（武安联合办公室张一英）一英同志：
    来信使我们获知武安城已开始纠偏，并有负责同志领导，这是很好的。关于上次报载武安损害工商业稿子，是根据太行清委会第六检查小组复写材料改写而成。因复写材料上标有“对武安执行党的工商业政策初步检查”等字样。材料后面，盖有“太行清委会第六检查组”的图章，文内没有谈到地委书记张慧如、武安县长张汉林等同志。因此我们看了，认为对武安工商业政策的检查是太行清委会第六检查组做的。在编者按语内希望武安领导同志对此检查表示态度。
