　　Men, Women, and Children Working Together
    Xu Jiahou Rushes to Plant Seeds
    [Huguan News] In Xu Jiahou Village, Third District, under the active leadership and promotion of branch secretary Xu Yueshun, villagers voluntarily organized themselves, pooling labor of people and animals to seize the time for planting. The whole village formed five mutual aid teams and thirteen groups, consisting of one hundred and forty-two men and eighty-two women and children. Before sowing, they made appropriate arrangements for daily life and clarified the division of labor. Each group selected skilled plowmen to manage plowing, skilled planters to manage sowing, children to lead livestock, young adults to carry manure and apply fertilizer, dig pits to plant corn and sweet potato vines, elderly men to manage dropping seeds, and women to spread fertilizer, hoe edges, pick up stones, and help in planting "Golden Queen" corn. Using two-legged seeders to plant "August 1st Grain" (谷子 - foxtail millet), they applied an average of 100 loads of fertilizer per mu. Working from dawn till dusk, in just five days, they planted 41 mu of "August 1st Grain" and 107 mu of "Golden Queen" corn. They also applied 1,500 loads of fertilizer to neglected land and 86 mu were fertilized. Ninety mu were plowed. The plan is to complete all plowing and planting before the seventh day of the fourth lunar month. They are now turning the soil and rushing to plant local millet and local corn. (Dai Yun)
