　　Ren County Launches Large-Scale Land Reclamation
　　Eleven Villages Reclaim Over 1,700 Mu

　　[Ren County News] To encourage mass production, Ren County has stipulated that barren land left uncultivated for three or four years will be exempt from levies for three years after reclamation. The masses are very enthusiastic about land reclamation, using pickaxes and shovels to cultivate every piece of land, every edge of the field, and every ditch. Villagers in places like Dalu Ze, Beizhangpo, and Tainanpo have spontaneously organized to cooperate in reclaiming large tracts of wasteland. In the Fourth District, Dabeizhang has reclaimed 100 mu, and Donggengzhuang has reclaimed 110 mu. In the Third District, Nijiazhuang had 1,000 mu of wasteland, of which 300 mu have already been reclaimed, and the rest is being reclaimed. Majiazhuang has completely reclaimed its original 250 mu of wasteland. According to statistics from eleven villages, a total of 1,732 mu of land has been reclaimed, all of which had been barren for more than seven or eight years. If each mu can yield 100 jin of coarse grains, production can be increased by more than 170,000 jin. The masses are energized in land reclamation. In villages like Beizhangpo, longer-term land reclamation organizations have been established in conjunction with handicrafts. (Zi Rui)

　　任县大开荒
  　十一个村已开一千七百多亩
    【任县消息】为鼓励群众生产，任县规定三、四年不种的熟荒，开了三年不出负担，群众对开荒的劲头很大，地头头地边边水沟沟，都用＠头铁锨刨的刨了、挖的挖了。大陆泽、北张坡、台南坡等村群众都自动互助起来开了大块荒地。四区大北张开荒一百亩，东耿庄开荒一百一十亩；三区尼家庄原有荒地一千亩，现已开了三百亩，其余正在开。马家庄原有荒地二百五十亩已完全开了。据十一个村统计，共开荒地一千七百三十二亩，都是荒芜了七八年以上的土地。若以每亩能收一百斤粗粮计，可增加生产量十七万余斤。群众开荒带了劲，在北张坡等村，与手工业结合成立了较长期的开荒组织。　　　（子瑞）
