　　Pay Attention to Protecting Small Vendors

　　Today's newspaper carries the opinions of the Daxinzhuang work group and the investigation materials of the Jilu豫 District Party Committee's research group in Puyang, providing us with a new issue: When correcting the "leftist" errors in the implementation of industry and commerce, we must take good care of the interests of small vendors and resolutely correct all erroneous policies and measures that infringe upon the interests of small vendors and restrict their development. Judging from these two materials, there have been many errors in the past policies towards small vendors: First, the tax burden is too heavy, affecting many small vendors to close down and become unemployed; second, state-owned stores control the market, do not require small invoices for wholesale, and increase prices at any time, which increases many difficulties for small vendors; third, the government has many prohibitions and strict restrictions, hindering free trade; fourth, some villages, seeing that small vendors live a little better than farmers, struggle against them, and even confiscate the stalls of small vendors. We must recognize that most small vendors are independent laborers and exploited people, and their commercial labor is needed throughout the production process and should be firmly protected in land reform and the new democratic country. Because they have small capital and meager profits, and many need to support their families, they must be given more care in terms of tax loans and other aspects. The leadership at all levels and the industrial and commercial tax authorities should immediately, according to the Central Bureau's instructions on industry and commerce, earnestly check the "leftist" errors of the past. While returning and compensating other fought industrial and commercial enterprises, we must resolutely correct the infringement on small vendors, make specific regulations, appropriately reduce tax rates, abolish all undue taxes and levies, and abolish unnecessary restrictions of various kinds, giving small vendors the convenience of free trade.

　　注意保护小商贩
    今天报载大辛庄工作组的意见和冀鲁豫区党委调查研究组在濮阳的调查材料，提供我们一个新的问题：在纠正执行工商业中的左倾错误时，必须很好关心小商贩的利益，坚决纠正一切侵害小商贩利益、限制小商贩发展的错误政策和措施。从这两个材料看，过去对小商贩的政策是有很多错误的：一是税收过重，影响许多小商贩停业、失业；二是公营商店统制市场，批发不要小票，随时提高货价，使小商贩增加不少困难；三是政府禁令多，限制严，妨碍自由买卖；四是有些村庄看到小商贩生活比农民好一点，便斗争，甚至没收小商贩的货摊。我们必须认识，小商贩大都是独立劳动者和被剥削者，他们的商业劳动，是整个生产过程中所需要的，在土地改革和新民主国家中，应受到坚决保护。由于他们本小利薄，又多需养家活口，所以在税收贷款及其他各方面都须对他们有更多照顾。各地领导上及工商业税收机关，应即根据中央局工商业指示，认真检查过去左倾错误。与退还补偿其他被斗工商业同时，要坚决纠正对小商贩的侵犯行为，作出具体规定，适当降低税率，废止一切不应有的捐税，取消不必要的各种限制，给小商贩以自由买卖的方便。
