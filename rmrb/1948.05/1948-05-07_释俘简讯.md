Brief News on Prisoner Releases

　　▲ The Political Department of the Northeast Military Region recently released 378 captured KMT military officers and soldiers. Among them were nine colonels, five lieutenant colonels, twenty-eight majors, and one puppet county magistrate and one secretary. Chen Linda, the former commander of the KMT's New 5th Army, said at the farewell meeting: "In the past, I was used by Chiang Kai-shek as a tool for the civil war against the people, and I didn't even realize it. Now, after learning, I have gradually recognized right from wrong. I deeply feel that being a commoner in a New Democratic society is much better than being a running dog official under the dictatorship of the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek."
　　▲ The East China People's Liberation Army has released 150 KMT officers, including Zhang Bofa, a captain company commander of the 51st Division captured in the Yilin battle, and 180 soldiers.
