　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Guangzhou dispatch: American imperialism's aggressive activities in South China have recently become more active. The American company Pan-American Trade and Investment Corporation has borrowed $300 million from the US Export-Import Bank to establish the "South China Construction Company" to monopolize industries in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. It is currently signing contracts with Song Ziwen, and businesses starting operations include fertilizer plants, cement plants, and glass factories. On Hainan Island, the Jiang gang's "Land Reclamation Bureau," actually controlled by American "advisor" McConaughy Johnson and Japanese war criminal Horiuchi Kansei, is exploiting cheap labor to cultivate wasteland in the southwest of the island, aiming to extract huge profits. The "Hainan Construction Company," dominated by American capital and Japanese advisors, monopolizes the Yulin Port fishery on the island. The Jiang gang's "National Fisheries Administration" has already designated the port as a base for Guangdong sea fisheries, establishing a Guangdong "Fisheries Branch Office" with several new fishing vessels to fish in the port. The six provinces of Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Jiangxi are jointly preparing to establish a "South China Agricultural Improvement Committee" as the general organ for American imperialism to control agriculture in South China. The committee will be chaired by the traitor Song Ziwen.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong Chinese business community has launched a movement to oppose the resumption of trade with Japan. A few days ago, three industrial organizations in Hong Kong submitted a memorandum to the British authorities in London, protesting the resumption of trade with Japan. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association held a press conference on the 15th, stating: "We will spare no effort to protest (America's) restoration of Japanese industry. Japanese industry will threaten the whole world, and not just Hong Kong, because the world will be flooded with cheap Japanese goods produced with cheap raw materials and labor." It is reported that this movement initiated by Chinese businessmen has aroused the attention of Chinese and foreign people in Hong Kong and the Far East to the dangers that will be caused by the revival of Japanese industry through the assistance of American imperialism. According to an AFP Hong Kong dispatch, Malaya has responded to the movement, and it is expected that other regions will also have similar reactions.
