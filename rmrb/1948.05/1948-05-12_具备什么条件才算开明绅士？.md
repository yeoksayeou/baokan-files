To the Editor:

I. The April 21st newspaper reported that "The Central Bureau instructed the Taiyue District Party Committee to correct left-leaning adventurism," mentioning that "Enlightened gentry are landlords who approve of anti-American, anti-Chiang, and land reform." The New Masses' reply to what constitutes an enlightened gentleman is the same as the Central Bureau's instructions, specifically stating that someone like Mr. Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, is considered an enlightened gentleman. Here, I have some questions. If revolutionary figures who are landlords or rich peasants in county and district governments meet the above conditions, are they considered enlightened gentry? Are there enlightened gentry in rural areas? If so, what conditions must they meet?

II. I was studying at the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee and I remember the Central Bureau's regulations on organizational rectification, which stated that those who marry landlord's daughters (unless they participate in work or receive revolutionary education) must be resolutely divorced. However, in the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee, there is a passage: "Freedom of divorce and marriage is guaranteed. Farmers or cadres who wish to marry daughters of landlords or rich peasants should also be allowed, and they should not be forced to divorce. Those who wish to marry in the future should be allowed to do so." To which level does the so-called "cadre" refer? Does it refer to rural cadres? Or does it refer to all those who participate in the revolution? If all levels of cadres are included, is this consistent with the spirit of the Central Bureau's regulations on organizational rectification for dealing with this issue?

III. If landlords and rich peasants are also engaged in industry and commerce, and they were engaged in business from the very beginning, should their industry and commerce be resolutely protected and not infringed upon, and do they have civil rights?

I would be grateful if you could take the trouble to answer the above questions!

Respectfully,
Reader, Xizheng

Comrade Xizheng:

I. According to the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee, enlightened gentry are landlords who approve of anti-Chiang, anti-American, and land reform. As long as these people actively support the people's revolutionary cause, whether they are in county or district governments or in villages, they should be treated as enlightened gentry. Mr. Li Dingming of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is a role model. II. Regarding the issue of cadres marrying daughters of landlords and rich peasants, it should be handled in accordance with the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee. The so-called cadre here includes cadres at all levels. Regarding the issue of conditions and restrictions, this point is clearly stated in the instructions: "...Freedom of divorce and marriage is guaranteed. Farmers or cadres who wish to marry daughters of landlords or rich peasants should also be allowed, and they should not be forced to divorce. Those who wish to marry in the future should be allowed to do so." There are no other conditions and restrictions. III. Landlords who operate businesses have civil rights.

    具备什么条件才算开明绅士？
    编辑同志：
    一、四月二十一号报载“中央局指示太岳区党委纠正左倾冒险主义”提到“开明绅士是地主中赞成反美反蒋与土改的分子”，在新大众答复什么算开明绅士，条件与中央局指示同，并具体的说出如象陕甘宁边区副主席李鼎铭先生那样，才算开明绅士。这里边我就产生了疑难问题，如象县区政权地主富农革命人物，具备上述条件，是否算开明绅士呢？农村中是否有开明绅士？如有，得具备啥条件？
    二、我在太行五地委学习，曾记得中央局整顿组织条例，对地主女儿与干部结婚者（除参加工作或受革命教育外）坚决离婚。但在中央局指示太岳区党委文中，有一段“离婚结婚保证自由，农民或干部与地主富农女儿结婚者，亦可允许，不要强制其离婚，今后愿结婚者听便。”这里所谓“干部”是指着哪一级？是农村干部？还是参加革命的都算呢？如不论那级干部都算，这和中央局整顿组织条例对处理这个问题的精神，是否一致呢？
    三、地富兼工商业者如本人出身就从事经商，工商业坚决保护，不准侵犯，他本人是否有公民权呢？
    以上几个问题，请你们费神答复一下为盼！
          读者      西征西征同志：
    一、按照中央局给太岳区党委指示，开明绅士就是地主中赞成反蒋反美及土地改革的分子，这些人只要他们以积极行动赞助人民革命事业的，不管是在县区政权或乡村里的，都应以开明绅士对待。陕甘宁李鼎铭先生是一个榜样。二、关于干部与地主富农女儿结婚的问题，应按照中央局给太岳区党委指示处理，这里所谓干部是包括各级干部在内的。关于条件限制问题，这一点指示里说得很明白：“……离婚结婚保证自由，农民或干部愿与地主富农女儿结婚者，亦应允许，不要强制其离婚，今后愿结婚者听便。”并没有什么其他条件限制。三、经营商业的地主是有公民权的。
