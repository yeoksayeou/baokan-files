[Taiyue News] The Yuncheng Salt Pond, which supplies salt to people in several provinces, has been helped by the democratic government, which has issued 400 million yuan in salt industry loans, and is now producing salt in large quantities. Thirty-six manufacturers have resumed salt production, and more than 2,000 workers are employed, including 1,598 long-term workers, 463 short-term workers, and 209 staff members. During the "May 1st" celebration, they held their first conference with more than 1,800 people, awarded model workers, and established a salt industry trade union. The workers said, "Now it's a new world!" Everyone is very happy. Before liberation, salt workers were even more miserable than ordinary workers. They worked in the ponds all day and all month, eating only two millet buns a day, without vegetables, and drinking salty water. Manufacturers, fearing they would run away, withheld their wages. When the factory closed (at the end of each year) and accounts were settled, because the Kuomintang currency devalued sharply, after much haggling and deductions, they were practically working for nothing and could not maintain their livelihoods. They were beaten and scolded and had no freedom. A few songs circulated among them: "I want to go to Henan, but I don't have travel money; I want to go to the salt pond, but I'm afraid of the whip"; "Coming down from the Zhongtiao Mountains, I see the great salt flats of Anyi, eating stored grain, sweating under the sun"; "Coming down from the Zhongtiao Mountains, my eyes are always wet with tears, entering the salt shed, it's like entering a prison." After liberation, their suffering was eliminated. During the first liberation of Yuncheng, the democratic government gave each person three dou of wheat as relief grain; after the second liberation, in addition to giving each person two jin of white flour and 100 yuan for vegetable money per day to maintain their lives, they then settled the wages that the manufacturers had owed in the past. Now the government has stipulated that wages must be paid monthly and cannot be delayed. The government completely returned to the manufacturers the salt price of Lu salt purchased last year, enabling them to quickly repay the accumulated wages to the workers. After the workers' lives stabilized, the democratic government, in order to help the salt merchants resume business, issued the first batch of 420 million yuan in salt industry loans. They also lent them a lot of grain (enough to eat from the start of work until the wheat harvest), livestock, tools, and supplies, such as reed mats, wooden pillows, water dippers, burlap bags, hemp ropes, wooden buckets, wooden carrying poles, brooms, iron wire, and nails. In order to improve labor-management relations, the feudal rules of beating and scolding salt workers were abolished, and the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital to jointly develop the salt industry was implemented. At the same time, it was advocated that "old monks" (experienced old foremen) should care for workers and help workers learn skills; salt workers should also respect the "old monks" and learn from their experience and technology. Because the salt workers' lives have been appropriately improved, they have begun to realize that the salt pond belongs to the new democratic country led by the working class, so their labor enthusiasm is very high. Worker representative Wang Zhiqiang said, "Now that we are liberated, we are working for ourselves today, so we must work hard. Those who work well should be rewarded; those who do not should be criticized. Let's all work together for everyone, for ourselves." The workers responded to this call and proposed the slogan "Each person completes one ming (each ming equals 40,000 jin by the new market scale) of salt per year." Manufacturer representative Sun Lianhua said, "The manufacturers thank the democratic government for its support, will obey the laws of the democratic government, improve the lives of salt workers, achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital, unite and work hard to produce, support the front lines, and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek."

　　适当改善盐工待遇贷款扶助厂商
  　运城盐业迅速恢复
    【太岳消息】供给好几省老百姓吃盐的运城盐池，经过民主政府的帮助，发放盐业贷款四万万元，现已大批出盐。恢复晒盐的厂商已有三十六家，工人上工的两千多人里头，长工一千五百九十八人，短工四百六十三人，职员二百零九人。纪念“五一”时，他们第一次开了一千八百多人的大会，奖励了模范，成立了盐业职工会。工人们说：“现在换了新世道啦！”每个人都很高兴。解放前，盐工比一般工人更苦，成天成月在池里做工，每天吃的是两顿小米馒，吃不上菜，喝的咸水。厂商怕他们逃跑，扣住工资不发。等到完厂（每年停工时候）算帐时，因为蒋票跌价很猛，经七折八扣的结果，差不多是白动弹，生活没法维持。他们挨打受骂，一点自由也没有。他们中间流行着几句歌：“有心下河南，没有盘川钱；有心下盐池，单怕疙瘩鞭”；“下了中条山，看见安邑的大盐滩，吃上仓谷米，熬的日头汗”；“下了中条山，两眼泪不干，进了盐×间，好象进了监”。解放后，他们的痛苦是去掉了。第一次运城解放时，民主政府每人发给救济粮小麦三斗；第二次解放后，除每人每天发给二斤白面、一百元菜金先叫维持生活外，接着就解决了厂商过去扣压欠下的工钱。现在政府已经规定按月发工钱，不准拖欠。政府把去年购买潞盐的盐价完全归还厂商，使他们能很快把积欠工资发还工人。工人生活安定以后，民主政府为帮助盐商复业，又发放盐业贷款第一批四万万二千万元。还借给他们很多粮食（可从开工吃到麦收）、牲畜、工具、用品，如芦席、木枕、水斗、麻包、麻绳、木桶、木担、扫帚、铁丝、钉子等。为了改善劳资关系，废除了打骂盐工的封建规矩，实行劳资两利共同发展盐业。同时提倡：“老和尚”（掌握技术的老工头）爱护工人，帮助工人学会本事；盐工也要尊重“老和尚”，向“老和尚”学经验，学技术。因为盐工生活得到适当改善，他们开始觉悟到盐池是工人阶级领导的新民主主义国家的，所以劳动情绪很高。工人代表王志强讲话说：“解放了，今天是为咱们自己干，要掏劲的干。谁劳动的好，就要受奖；不好的要受批评。大家一条心为大家干，为自己干。”工人们响应这个号召，提出“每人每年完成一名（每名合新市秤四万斤）盐”的口号。厂商代表孙联花说：“厂商感谢民主政府的扶助，要服从民主政府的法令，改善盐工的生活，劳资两利，团结起来努力生产，支援前线，打倒蒋介石”。
