　　Democratic Governments in Jin-Cha-Ji Regions
　　Use Loans to Promote Agricultural and Sideline Production
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st dispatch] Democratic governments at all levels in the border region are using loans to promote agricultural and sideline production and water conservancy construction. After Hejian and Jin counties issued 500 million yuan in loans, it has stimulated more than 80 million yuan in private capital and a large amount of idle wealth to be invested in production. After two villages in Gaocheng obtained loans, they drove more than 4.8 million yuan of private capital into production. Now, the number of livestock and agricultural implements has greatly increased in various places. Yixian and Jin counties have newly added 317 head of livestock, and Raoyang alone has added 59 head of livestock in one district. Hejian and Ding counties have organized 287 women's groups to participate in textile production, and Suning has organized 187 mutual aid groups for production; Beigaojiaying Village in Zhengding has also established a shipbuilding cooperative, newly building seven large wooden boats, and 67 fishing boats have been newly organized in Wenxin Water Region for fishing; the saltpeter boiling industry in Jinghai, Hejian and other counties has been greatly developed with the support of loans. In Chengxiang, Hejian alone, the number of saltpeter workers has increased by more than 52% compared with the past, and 87 new saltpeter ponds have been added. The saltpeter boiling industry has gradually expanded from Chengxiang to nearby villages. Other rural sideline industries have also seen new developments in various places. In terms of water conservancy construction, after obtaining loans, Suning, Jin, Gaocheng and other five counties have newly added more than 40 water wells and repaired more than 30 old wells; Anxin once loaned 70,000 jin of grain to help Xiaoying and other seven villages repair sluices and open canals, planning to turn 20,000 mu of dry land into fertile fields. Wenxin Water Region borrowed nearly 30,000 jin of rice seeds, benefiting nearly a thousand households, and now more than 20,000 mu of rice fields can be planted in the entire region. After obtaining loans, the enthusiasm for production among the masses in disaster-stricken villages in Quyang and other counties has greatly increased, and the difficulties in life have also been resolved. Villages in the border areas such as Liangxiang and Huailai, which had been turned into "no-man's land" by the "three-all policy" of the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, have resumed production after production assistance. Banbidian Village in Yi County has organized five work teams.
