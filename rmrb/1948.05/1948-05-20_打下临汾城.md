　　Capture of Linfen City
　　Our People's Liberation Army captured Linfen City on the 17th, completely wiping out the thirteen regiments of Yan's bandit troops defending the city. This is another great victory.

　　Linfen is a large city in southern Shanxi, on the Fen River. The Japanese invaders, Yan Xishan, and Hu Zongnan all built solid fortifications, but these fortifications could not withstand the bombardment of our People's Liberation Army's artillery. This victory proves that our People's Liberation Army is incredibly powerful. No matter how solid the fortifications or how stubborn the enemy, there is no place we cannot take.

　　Linfen City was the last stronghold of the Chiang-Yan bandits in southern Shanxi. Now that this stronghold has been removed, all of southern Shanxi is under the control of our people.

　　打下临汾城
    咱人民解放军，在十七号那天，打下了临汾城，把守城的阎匪十三个团消灭得一干二净。这又是一个大胜利。
    临汾是山西南部汾河边上一个大城市，日寇、阎锡山、胡宗南都修了坚固的工事，可是这些工事都顶不住咱解放军大炮一轰。这个胜利，证明了咱人民解放军力量强大无比，工事再坚固，敌人再顽强，也没有打不下来的地方。
    临汾城是蒋阎匪在晋南最后一个钉子，现在打掉了这个钉子，全山西南部就都是咱人民的天下了。
