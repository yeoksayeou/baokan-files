　　【Taiyue News】The industrialists and businessmen in Yangcheng Town have understood the industrial and commercial policies, removed their worries, and are developing their businesses freely. The "Leftist" errors in the leadership in Yangcheng last winter also harmed the industrial and commercial sectors, so industrial and commercial development stopped. They classified businessmen as farmers. For example, Wei Bingxun of the Zhenxing Mutual Aid Society was classified as a wealthy middle peasant, and because he was a "designated merchant" during the Japanese occupation, he was also treated as a traitor and local tyrant to be struggled against, with his property confiscated, his doors sealed, and his shares frozen. Loans to merchants were also taken back and re-loaned to poor peasants and farmhands. This frightened the merchants. Wei Bingxun buried goods worth hundreds of thousands of yuan underground, refusing to take them out; he withdrew his shares of about two hundred thousand yuan from the Zhenxing Mutual Aid Society, leaving only twenty or thirty thousand yuan, but he was reluctant to spend it and bought some oil to store. In December, when the price of oil rose, he was not happy but worried, quietly telling people: "I'm afraid of making money, making money again!" The ×× Mutual Aid Society in Nanguan had its own money but dared not take it out, only wanting to borrow money, and if they couldn't get a loan, they wouldn't do it. Many merchants were like this. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the merchants saw it and felt a little more at ease. The leadership also corrected the past deviations, such as giving loans to merchants and allowing free withdrawal of shares. In March, Director Niu of the Administrative Office invited several old merchants, such as Liu Guoyi and Ning Shaojiu, to discuss industrial and commercial policies, resolutely protecting them and never infringing on them, and soliciting their opinions. They all talked about their opinions, and then asked Director Niu to answer several questions. For example, what class would they be classified as? Director Niu told them: "You are independent industrialists and businessmen and should be protected. You should do business well in the future." From then on, their mood changed. Ning Shaojiu used to be afraid to eat a bowl of dry rice in the store, and because he had been the vice chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, he was afraid of being struggled against, and was always gloomy. Now he dares to eat noodles outside and is happy and smiling. On April 10th, the County Industrial and Tax Bureau, in conjunction with the town government, convened a meeting of merchants. In addition to re-explaining the Party's industrial and commercial policies, it was also decided that if anyone took out past inventory, they would not be taxed or confiscated, and they could freely buy and sell, and help with sales. Wei Bingxun took out the more than one hundred thousand yuan worth of goods he had stored in the past, including foreign red, bright red, peach red, lotus green, as well as red, green, blue, black, and various colored dyes, twenty-five barrels, twenty catties of copper coins, fifty packs of foreign fire, and foreign locks, etc., to sell. Zhang Xiaoshen in Nanguan, Hou Xiaoshuan in Dongguan, and others also took out their inventories. They also invested in shops or pooled shares to engage in commerce. Zhang ＠feng invested more than one hundred thousand yuan in Liu Daoguo's dyeing workshop, and another mutual aid society opened in Nanguan. The Xinhua Mutual Aid Society did not engage in transportation once from December last year to January this year. Recently, it has run to Linqing, Jincheng, and Yicheng three times in the past month, and is now going to Yuanqu and Qinghua, and has not yet returned.

　　纠正“左”倾错误去掉心病
  　阳城商人放手经营
  　地下物资纷纷投入市场
    【太岳消息】阳城城关镇的工商业者，明白了工商业政策去掉心病，放手发展业务。阳城去冬领导上的“左”倾错误，也危害到工商业方面，所以工商业都停止发展。他们把商人划成农民成份。如把振兴互助社的卫秉勋，划成富裕中农，又因他是日寇在时的“指定商”，也当成奸霸来斗争，没收、封门、冻结股金。又收回商人贷款，转贷给贫雇农。这样商人就恐慌起来。卫秉勋把价值百把万元的货物埋在地下，不往出拿；把入振兴互助社的二十来万股金，抽得只剩下两三万元，可是又舍不得花，又买了些油存起来。腊月里油价大了，他不是欢喜是发愁，悄悄对人说：“怕赚了钱，又赚了钱啦！”南关××互助社自己有钱不敢往出拿，光想贷款，贷不上就不干，这样的商人很多。土地法大纲公布后，商人看到了，稍稍安心了些，领导上又纠正了过去的偏向，如给商人贷款，股金抽取自由等。三月间行署牛主任又请了刘国义、宁绍九等几位老商人座谈工商业政策，坚决保护决不侵犯，并征求他们意见。他们都谈了自己的意见，后又要求牛主任解答几个问题。如他们谈划成什么成份？牛主任告诉他们说：“你们是独立的工商业者，应受到保护，以后要好好做买卖。”从此以后，他们的情绪就变化了。宁绍九以前吃碗干米饭都不敢到柜上吃，又因为当过商会副主席，光怕斗争，终日愁眉苦眼，现在吃面也敢在外面吃了，喜眉笑眼的。县工税局又在四月十日协同镇公所召集商人开会，除重新解释我党的工商业政策外，又决定了如有人把过去存货拿出来不上税，不没收，可以自由买卖，并帮助推销。卫秉勋就把过去存的洋红、大红、桃红、莲青，及红、绿、蓝、黑及各色煮色二十五桶，铜元二十斤，洋火五十包，及洋锁等约值洋一百来万元的货，拿出来卖。南关张小申、东关侯小拴等，也把存货拿出来了。又纷纷投资到商店，或集股闹商业。张＠峰把十来万元入到刘道国的染房，南关又开了一家互助社。有家新合互助社，去年十二月到今年正月没搞过一次运输，最近一个月来就到临清、晋城、翼城跑了三次，现在又去垣曲、清化，还没有回来。
