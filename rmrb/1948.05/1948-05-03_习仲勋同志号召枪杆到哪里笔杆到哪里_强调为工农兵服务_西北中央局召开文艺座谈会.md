Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th: The Northwest Central Bureau convened a symposium of literary and art workers from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 5th. More than 40 people, including Zhang Jichun, Ma Jianling, and Li Ji, attended the meeting. At the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the literary and artistic activities in the border region over the past year and how to cooperate with the war to liberate Northwest China in the future. Everyone believed that in the past year, literary and art workers in the border region had traveled thousands of miles with the army, fully promoting the spirit of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, in practical work, the planned organization and guidance of creative work were not enough, so there were too few creations reflecting the rich combat life of the military and civilians in the border region. The meeting also made the following decisions: (1) The first and second Northwest Cultural Work Troupes and the Joint Political Propaganda Team will set out to work in the new districts; (2) Supplement the creation teams in various cultural work troupes and drama troupes; (3) Prepare for the establishment of literary and art publications throughout the region, strengthen contact with all parties, and carry out criticism and self-criticism on the literary and art front. When the symposium ended on the 7th, Comrade Xi Zhongxun, secretary of the Northwest Bureau, spoke, pointing out the shortcomings of the border region's literary and artistic creation over the past year, such as insufficient reflection of reality and the failure to develop criticism and self-criticism. He proposed that the guiding principle for literary and artistic work in the future is to cooperate with the restoration of agricultural construction, the liberation of Northwest China, and strive for the victory of the national revolutionary war. Therefore, literary and art workers should reflect more on the lives of people of all classes in the old liberated areas, and express the suffering of the people in the newly liberated areas under the brutal rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, their love for the People's Liberation Army, and their actual struggle to participate in the revolution and carry out land reform. Finally, he called on literary and art workers to cooperate with the Northwest People's Liberation Army. Wherever the gun goes, the pen goes; mobilize the broad masses of people to fight against Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan and against feudalism. Comrade Ma Mingfang, deputy secretary of the Northwest Bureau, deeply praised the border region's literary and art workers for their integration with reality. He said: The accumulation of this kind of practical life experience, bit by bit, is the source of creative wisdom. He hoped that the literary and art workers in the border region would reflect the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which has undergone a long period of revolutionary struggle, from all aspects with a realistic spirit. He emphasized that the root of the border region's literary and artistic undertakings lies in cultivating more local cultural cadres in the border region. Finally, Director of the Propaganda Department, Comrade Li Zhuoran, made a summary. He said: The literary and art workers in the border region have undergone a year of training in participating in actual struggles. He hoped that everyone would review Chairman Mao's speech at the Forum on Literature and Art in 1942 to summarize the work of the past year in order to better implement the literary and artistic policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. He said that the current improvement in drama, in addition to strengthening the creators' and actors' experience of mass life and carrying out relevant business policy studies, it is extremely important to adopt a combination of collective creation and specialized research. In the past, most of them were too eager to achieve quick results, so the content and art were often not rich enough, so better scripts only played a temporary role, and afterwards they all seemed to "not be popular anymore," which is a pity. Regarding the issue of criticism, Comrade Zhuoran also pointed out that the lack of criticism and self-criticism in the literary and artistic front has a long history and has not been corrected yet. Without criticism and self-criticism, it is like closing the windows and not letting fresh air in. Our newspaper has made significant progress since the launch of the anti-Kelikong and individualism ideological style. This spirit should be implemented in all aspects of literature and art. Comrade Zhuoran, based on the situation reflected in the recent land reform and at this symposium, especially pointed out that the main shortcomings in the current literary and artistic work are the lack of specific guidance from the leadership, the departmentalism of the workers, individual prominence, and the hasty and undisciplined work style, so they are impatient to study in the tortuous mass struggle, research problems and organize materials in actual life, and even look down on reality and other petty-bourgeois erroneous views. These must be resolutely criticized and overcome. Finally, regarding the issue of literary and artistic forms to cooperate with launching the struggle of the newly liberated people to emancipate themselves, Comrade Zhuoran fully agreed to make full use of local folk forms and engage in a large number of diverse and small-scale literary and artistic activities.

　　习仲勋同志号召枪杆到哪里笔杆到哪里
  　强调为工农兵服务
  　西北中央局召开文艺座谈会
    【新华社西北二十四日电】西北中央局于五日召开陕甘宁边区文艺工作者座谈会，到会有张季纯、马健翎、李季等四十余人，会上，对过去一年来的边区文艺活动，及今后如何配合解放大西北战争的问题均作了详细讨论。大家认为过去一年，边区文艺工作者随军转战千里，充分发扬了文艺为工农兵服务的精神，但在实际工作中有计划的组织与指导创作工作做的不够，因此反映边区军民丰富的战斗生活的创作还太少。会议并作了以下决定：（一）西北文工团一、二两团及联政宣传队出发新区工作；（二）充实各文工团和剧团中的创作小组；（三）筹办全区的文艺刊物，加强与各方面的联系，开展文艺战线上的批评与自我批评。七日座谈会结束时，西北局书记习仲勋同志讲话，指出一年来边区文艺创作反映实际不够和未展开批评和自我批评等缺点，提出文艺界今后工作的方针，是配合恢复农业建设，解放大西北，争取全国革命战争的胜利。因此文艺工作者要多反映老解放区各阶层人民生活，并将新解放区人民在蒋胡暴政下的痛苦，他们对人民解放军的热爱和参加革命进行土改的实际斗争表现出来。最后他号召文艺工作者配合西北人民解放军，枪杆到哪里，笔杆到哪里，动员广大人民为反蒋胡反封建而斗争，西北局副书记马明芳同志对边区文艺工作者于实际结合一点深加赞许，他说：这种实际生活的经历一点一滴的积累就是创作智慧的源泉。希望边区文艺工作者以实事求是的精神，从各方面反映经过长期革命斗争的陕甘宁边区。他着重提出边区文艺事业的生根在于更多的培养边区本地的文化干部。最后宣传部长李卓然同志作了总结。他说：边区文艺工作者经过一年来参加实际斗争的锻炼，希望大家重温毛主席一九四二年在文艺座谈会的讲话来总结一年来的工作，以便更好的贯彻为工农兵服务的文艺方针。他说目前戏剧方面的提高，除了加强创作者与演员对群众生活的体验及进行有关业务的政策学习外，采取集体创作与专门钻研结合极为重要。过去大多为了急于求成，使内容与艺术上常常不够充实，因而比较好的剧本也不过起了一时的作用，过后似乎都“吃不开了”，这是很可惜的。关于批评问题，卓然同志并指出缺乏批评与自我批评在文艺战线上由来已久，而至今仍未改正。没有批评与自我批评就等于闭塞窗户，不让新鲜空气进来。我们的报纸自开展反克里空与个人主义的思想作风以来，进步显著。这种精神应当贯彻到文艺的各方面去，卓然同志就最近土改中及此次座谈会上所反映的情况，特别指出目前文艺工作方面的主要缺点是领导上缺乏具体指导，工作者的本位主义，个人突出，作风上的急燥散漫，因而不耐烦在曲折的群众斗争中学习，在实际生活中钻研问题，整理材料，甚至瞧不起现实等等小资产阶级的错误观点。这些都必须坚决批评克服。最后，关于配合发动新解放区人民翻身斗争的文艺形式问题，卓然同志完全同意充分利用当地民间形式及大量从事多样的小型文艺活动。
