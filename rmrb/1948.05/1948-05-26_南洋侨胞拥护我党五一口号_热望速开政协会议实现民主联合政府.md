　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's "May 1st" slogan has been warmly supported by the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. According to a United Press dispatch: One hundred and twenty overseas Chinese democratic organizations, representing 100,000 overseas Chinese in Singapore, held a meeting on May 4th and resolved to send a telegram to the CCP Central Committee, supporting the proposal to quickly convene a Political Consultative Conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a People's Congress and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. The "Nanyang Overseas Chinese Daily" in its editorial, denounced the bandit Chiang as "a counterfeit president in a counterfeit government." Furthermore, the Siamese Overseas Chinese Association for the Promotion of Fatherland Peace, Democracy and Unity issued a circular telegram on May 16th, responding to the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's May 1st call. The circular telegram pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionary regime has committed heinous crimes against the country and the people for the past twenty years, and expressed that it would never recognize the pseudo-National Assembly and the illegal election of a pseudo-president by the bandit Chiang.
