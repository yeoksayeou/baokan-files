(Taiyue News) At the beginning of May, the Sixth District of Yangcheng held a joint meeting of village cadres to examine and correct "leftist" deviations. The sealing of doors and control of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against were all cancelled. The doors of landlords and rich peasants were also opened. On the surface, it seems to be going well, but in reality, there are many problems. What is particularly noteworthy is that the thinking of cadres and the masses has not been straightened out. Many cadres treat correcting deviations as completing tasks assigned by higher authorities. Some say, "How can we not implement the Party's policy?" Others say, "Let us withdraw, we withdraw; let us open, we open. What can we do?" Many poor and hired peasants in villages also express dissatisfaction with correcting deviations and voice complaints. Because thinking has not been straightened out, cadres are haphazard in publicizing the policy. Some village cadres initially told landlords and rich peasants, "We are cancelling control and opening doors to resettle you"; later, they said, "Cancellation is cancellation, but you cannot be reckless." They continued control in a disguised form. Regarding middle peasants, they would say, "You were wrongly struggled against. We are all one family; you shouldn't have been struggled against. Now we are cancelling control, returning your belongings, and you should produce well"; then they would say, "Production is still a problem. We'll talk about compensation later." Therefore, the middle peasants who were controlled and struggled against were very happy to hear the first part, but worried after hearing the second part, saying, "It's good now, but what about compensation in the autumn?" Landlords and rich peasants feel that the cancellation of control is fake. Guo Xiaobao, a cadre in Dianyao Village, even openly said to the masses, "We are now compensating middle peasants to encourage good production, but in the autumn, won't we still seal their doors and impose control? Beat them when they should be beaten, and handle them when they should be handled!" Because thinking has not been straightened out, phenomena of disguised infringement on middle peasants and control of landlords have occurred. For example, in Wawutou Village, the doors of Lu Yuanming and his four brothers, who were under control, were opened by the village, but it was not announced that the control of their property was cancelled. Moreover, the more than one hundred catties of third-class disabled veteran rice issued to these brothers when they were discharged from the army were lent to the elementary school teacher to offset the teacher's salary. Liu Benzhu of Nuan Village, whose door was sealed, had no food to eat after the door was opened and asked to borrow grain. Village cadre Liu Ge@ said, "What did you do with last year's grain?" When he wanted to borrow from relatives, he was not allowed to. A teacher at San Nanpo Elementary School in Yuanxing Village said, "Now we don't control peasants, but that doesn't mean we don't control landlords and rich peasants." After Jianhua (a rich peasant) from Jihou Village had his control cancelled, his child Shuwen cut more than ten bundles of twigs on the slope to prepare for burning fertilizer. Poor and hired peasants in the village carried away most of it. The village chief and the agricultural association cadre saw it but did not correct it. Zhang Yuanyong (a well-to-do middle peasant) in Dianyao Village had his door opened on the first day, and the next day the director of the agricultural association had his wife borrow grain from others. A widow in Shun Di (said to be a landlord) had her control cancelled, and a hired hand said, "You can't come out to produce for us, but can't you produce for us at home?" He sent a spool of thread to the widow's house, still wanting the widow to weave cloth without paying wages. It was said that the landlord's mouth in Yangshugou had his control cancelled, but in reality, he was still working in the mutual aid team for others, receiving only one liter of rice per day (the general wage is three or four liters). In many villages, landlords whose control was cancelled still had to ask for leave to go out.

　　阳城六区有些村庄
  　仍在变相实行“管制”
    【太岳消息】五月初头，阳城六区开了个村干部联席会，检查纠正“左”倾偏向，对错斗中农的封门、管制，都取消了，地主富农的门也开了，表面看来搞的还不错，可是实际上问题很多。值得大大注意的是干部和群众思想并没弄通。不少干部把纠偏当作是完成上级任务。有的说：“党的政策还能不执行？”有的说：“让退就退、让开就开，有什么法子？”不少村的贫雇农，对纠正偏向也表示不满，说二话。因为思想没弄通，干部就胡乱宣传政策。有些村干部开头对地主富农说：“取消管制，开门安置你们”；后边又说：“取消是取消了，你们可不能随便。”变相的继续管制。对中农也是前边说“斗错了，一家人，不该斗，现在取消管制，退还东西，好好生产”；后边又说：“现在生产，问题还是问题，将来填补时再说。”因此被管制斗争的中农，听了前边很高兴，听了后边的话，又提心吊胆说：“现在很好，秋后填补又怎样？”地主富农感到取消管制是假的。殿腰村干部郭小保更公开的在群众中说：“现在赔偿中农是为了好好生产，秋后填补还不是照样封门，照样管制？该打就打，该办就办！”因为思想没弄通，发生了变相侵犯中农与管制地主的现象。如瓦屋头村被管制户卢元明兄弟四人，村里把他的门子开了，可是没宣布取消财产的管制。并且还把这家兄弟退伍时发给的三等残废米百多斤，借给了小学教员，顶了教员的工资米。暖村封门户刘本住，开门后没粮吃，要求借粮，村干部刘圪＠说：“你去年的粮食干了甚啦？”人家要到亲戚家借，也不让去借。元兴村三南坡小学教员说：“现在是不管制农民，并不是不管制地主富农。”被管制户荣安的老婆到邻家借粮，教员把这老婆叫到校内说：“你不作活，乱跑什么啦？不准你去别人家。”吉后村建华（富农）的孩子书文取消管制后，在坡里割了十多捆圪枝，准备烧粪，村内贫雇给担走大部。村长和农会干部看见，也不纠正。殿腰村张元永（富裕中农）第一天开门，第二天农会主任即让他老婆到人家家内借粮。舜帝一个寡妇（据说是地主）取消了管制后，雇贫说：“你不能出来给咱生产，还不能在家给咱生产？”便将线子送到这寡妇家里，仍旧要寡妇织布，不付工钱。杨树沟的地主嘴说取消了管制，实际还在互助组给旁人劳动，每天只给一升米（一般的工资是三、四升）。许多村取消管制的地主，出门还是请假。
