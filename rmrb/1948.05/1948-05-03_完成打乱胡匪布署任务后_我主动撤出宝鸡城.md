　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: After completing the task of disrupting the enemy's deployment, destroying the bandit Hu's rear, and completely annihilating the defending enemy, the Northwest People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Baoji City on the 28th. Before withdrawing, our army had transported all the main military materials from the bandit Hu's arsenal in the city and thoroughly destroyed the remaining ones.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st: Earlier this month, a unit of the People's Liberation Army released Bai Zhixiu, the puppet magistrate of Chengcheng County. Before leaving, the head of the unit bid him farewell and gave him travel expenses. Bai is from Weinan and is a confidant of Zhu Shaoxhou, the Chiang bandit's chairman of Shaanxi Province. On the 27th of last month, when our army attacked Chengcheng County, he foolishly led more than 600 security police to resist and was completely captured by us. When our army brought him to his original office, he saw that everything in the room, including the inkwell on the table, the calendar on the wall, and the books on the shelf, were unchanged and exactly the same as the furnishings before he was captured. He greatly admired the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army.

　　完成打乱胡匪布署任务后
  　我主动撤出宝鸡城
    【新华社西北三十日电】西北解放军于完成打乱敌人布署，破坏胡匪后方并全歼守敌之任务后，于二十八日主动撤出宝鸡城，我军于撤离前已将城内胡匪军火库中之主要军火物资悉数运出，并将余留者予以彻底破坏。
    【新华社西北一日电】解放军某部于本月初释放伪澄城县长拜志修，临行前该部首长并予欢送，发给路费。拜系渭南人，为蒋匪陕西省主席祝绍周心腹。上月二十七日我军进攻澄城县城时，他曾愚蠢地率领保警队六百余人抵抗，当即为我全部生俘。当我军把他带到他原来的办公室时，他看见室内一切东西连桌上的墨盒，墙上的日历，案架上的书籍等都毫无变动，和他就俘前的陈设完全一样，他对解放军的纪律严明极为叹服。
