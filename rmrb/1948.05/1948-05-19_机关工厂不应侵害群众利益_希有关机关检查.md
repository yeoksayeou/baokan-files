Criticism and Suggestions

　　Government Factories Should Not Infringe Upon the Interests of the Masses
  　Hope Relevant Authorities Inspect
    Comrade Editor:
    Recently, many government factories in our district have committed numerous acts infringing upon the interests of the masses, causing popular dissatisfaction. However, the masses are still afraid to speak out. After village cadres saw news of criticisms and suggestions regarding individual personnel from some government agencies and troops infringing upon the interests of the masses constantly appearing in the newspaper, they wished for district cadres to write an article for publication in the paper. Now, the specific incidents are listed as follows:
    (1) In Dongshuiyang Village in our district, during the mass movement, more than seventy large vats (belonging to the landlord's distillery) were confiscated. Before they could be distributed, the Licheng Dongshuiyang Third Distillery, established by the Third Special Commissioner's Office, borrowed these vats, along with the building, to open for business. For over a year, they have not proposed returning or compensating for them. After party rectification, in early March, they proposed compensating with a discounted price, which is certainly good. However, when paying, they only compensated 5,000 yuan per vat. The masses reflected that the amount was too little. District cadres then negotiated with the distillery's responsible comrade. The distillery comrade said personally: "The distillery vats have good and bad ones, a fair average value is 7,000 yuan per vat." Then, for more than seventy large vats, we are shorted 140,000 to 150,000 yuan.
    (2) The Licheng Dongcui Factory Construction Department recently sawed down many trees in Maicang Village. The price wasn't agreed upon before cutting the trees. After the trees were felled and hauled away, the price was still not discussed. The factory's leader responsible for cutting trees said: "This year, every cubic foot of timber is worth eight jin of rice." According to the masses, the factory previously priced trees at ten jin of millet per cubic foot. Now that prices have risen, why has the tree price decreased to eight jin? The factory comrades were unwilling to exert effort when cutting the trees, sitting on the ground platform to cut, leaving very high stumps. Generally, more than one chi was left (trees growing on slopes had three to four chi exposed on the downhill side). Calculated at eight jin of rice per chi, the masses lost six to seven hundred jin of rice. What was left could not be used. Maicang Village has many fruit trees, growing very close to timber trees, not far apart. The factory did not pay enough attention when cutting trees, damaging several productive trees. Peach and apricot trees are not a big deal, but the masses are most dissatisfied when walnut trees are damaged (it takes more than ten years to bear walnuts). Damage to wheat seedlings is needless to say. After the work team discovered these opinions from the masses, they had the masses send representatives to negotiate with the comrade responsible for cutting the trees. However, the result of the negotiation was that the factory leader responsible for cutting trees had all one or two dozen workers go on strike, and made an unreasonable demand to the masses to cover all the workers' wages, using big talk to intimidate the masses. At that time, work stopped, and frightened cadres and masses shirked responsibility and blamed each other. Some masses said: "We shouldn't have brought it up to them, who can afford to offend the public? Let's just let it be." Later, the cadres negotiated again, and the tree cutting resumed. Originally, seventy-two trees were marked, but after the cadres suggested it, more than ten more trees were cut. A total of more than eighty trees were cut. The masses said: "We can't offer opinions, if we do, they cut more than ten more trees in retaliation."
    (3) The Zhao Dian boat construction, it is said, is a joint public-private venture. In early April, they bought a large poplar tree in Maicang. This tree was divided to a liberated farmer last year during the movement. At that time, they only took a government letter of introduction, felled the tree without agreeing on a price, and conscripted labor in Xi Wu to haul the planks away. Then, they sent 25,000 yuan. This tree was four zhang and five chi tall (not including the top of the tree that cannot be used for planks, but was also hauled away), four chi and eight cun thick. At that time, it was sawn into planks, totaling nine zhang, two cun thick, and two zhang and two chi and five cun long. According to the factory's fixed price, one cubic foot is ten jin of millet, which is more than nine hundred jin of millet. Converted at the current market price of millet, that is 180,000 to 190,000 yuan, but they only sent 25,000 yuan. The liberated farmer said: "You are the government, you don't need money, we support it." But behind their backs, they said: "Hmph, you are the government, and you still give the common people less money?!" The masses have not accepted the tree money, and it is still unresolved. Based on the above, individual personnel from government factories, when going to the countryside, threaten the masses by invoking the name of the government, and many village-level cadres and masses dare not speak out, creating antagonism towards the government among the masses. We feel that this practice is by individual personnel, and affects the relationship between the entire government factory and the masses. We especially suggest that the responsible comrades of the relevant government factories make a good inspection, and educate the individual comrades. In particular, the construction department should quickly return the tree money to the masses at a fair market price.

### 机关工厂不应侵害群众利益　希有关机关检查

专栏：批评与建议

　　机关工厂不应侵害群众利益
  　希有关机关检查编辑同志：
    近来有不少机关工厂在我区发生不少侵犯群众利益的事情，引起群众不满。但群众到现在仍不敢吭声。村干部看到报纸上不断登载有些机关部队个别人员侵犯群众利益的批评与建议消息之后，他们愿让区干部写稿登到报上。现在将几件具体事情列写如下：
    （一）我区东水洋村在群运时斗出七十多个大缸（系地主酒房大缸），还未分配，即有三专署所设黎城东水洋第三酒坊，将这缸连房子都借用，开设营业。一年有余，并未提出归还与赔偿。整党以后，三月初即提出折价赔偿，这当然是很好的。但在出钱时，每个只赔出五千元。群众反映钱少，区干部当时和酒坊负责同志交涉。酒坊同志亲口说：“酒坊缸有好坏，公道平均每个缸值七千元”。那么七十多个大缸，就少给我们十四、五万元钱。
    （二）黎城东崔工厂建筑部最近在麦仓村锯了很多树，杀树前价钱不搞，杀倒后把树拉走，仍未说价。该厂领导杀树负责同志说：“今年每方尺木料成了八斤米。”根据群众反映，以前工厂买树每方尺定价小米十斤。现在物价上涨，树价为何降成了八斤？该厂同志杀树时不愿下力，坐地台杀树，留茬很高。一般留一尺多（靠坡长的树，下坡露三四尺）。每尺按八斤米计算，群众就少得米六、七百斤。留下的又不能使用。麦仓村果木树很多，和木材树长的很近，离不远。工厂在杀树时注意不够，砸坏了好几棵生产树。桃树、杏树都不大要紧，特别是核桃树砸坏，群众最不满意（种十几年才能结核桃）。砸坏麦苗就更不必说了。工作组发现群众这些意见，让群众推派干部去与杀树负责同志交涉，但交涉结果，工厂领导杀树的同志将一、二十个工人全部罢工，并向群众提出包赔他全部工人工资的无理要求，拿大话来威吓群众。当时工停了，吓的干部群众互相推诿，互相埋怨。有的群众说：“不该给人家提来，公家的事谁惹的起？弄成甚算甚吧。”后来干部又去交涉，杀开树了。原来号了七十二棵，经干部提意后，多杀了十几棵。共成了八十余棵。群众说：“不能提意见，提了提多杀了十几棵，报复了咱一下”。
    （三）赵店建船，据说是公私合办。四月初在麦仓买了一棵大杨树，此树是翻身农民在去年运动时顶分作价分的。当时只拿个政府介绍信，把树杀倒，未有搞价，并在西仵要差，将板拉走。随后捎来二万五千元。此树有四丈五尺高（不能出板的树顶不在内，但也拉走了），四尺八寸粗，当时就拉成板，共计九丈，厚二寸，长二丈二尺五。按工厂定的价，一方尺小米十斤，该米九百多斤。以现在米市价来折，该洋十八、九万元，但只捎来二万五千元。翻身农民说：“你们是公家，不要钱啦，我们拥护了吧”。但背后又说：“哼，你们是公家，还少给老百姓钱哩？！”树价群众未接，到现在仍未解决。根据以上，机关工厂个别人员下乡，动不动拿上公家二字威吓群众，不少村级干部和群众不敢吭声，造成群众对公家的对抗。我们感觉，此种做法是个别人员，而影响了整个的机关工厂与群众关系。特提出各该机关工厂负责同志做很好检查，并对个别同志进行教育。特别是建设部门，应迅速按公道市价，将树钱归还群众。
