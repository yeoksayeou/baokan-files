Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: New York dispatch: When Wallace received Stalin's reply during a speech at a San Francisco radio station on the 11th, he said in an emotionally trembling voice, "I am extremely happy and simply speechless. Stalin's comments on my open letter as the most important document for striving for international peace are, in effect, a statement by the Soviet Premier to the American people who are suggesting peace; Stalin's extraordinary open reply, following closely after the recent US-Soviet notes, is the beginning of genuine US-Soviet peace negotiations." Prior to this, Wallace had condemned the US government's refusal to openly negotiate with the Soviet Union on the radio, saying: The Molotov-Smith notes once meant there was hope of resolving the differences between the US and the Soviet Union, but this hope has been rejected by Washington. "The Soviet Union's expression of the need for peace has disrupted the plans of the Wall Street military clique, which fears peace as much as we all fear war."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Prague dispatch: Czech public opinion highly praises Stalin's reply to Wallace's open letter. The Czech "Truth" newspaper editorial strongly stated: Stalin's reply will be praised by the millions upon millions of people around the world who long for peace. This answer illustrates that the Soviet Union is the only major power that adheres to peace and fights for peace. "Free Speech" said: "Since Molotov and Stalin issued their replies, the United States should bear full responsibility for the current international situation. Because the Soviet Union has done everything possible to ensure and consolidate peace, and to eliminate all differences."

　　华莱士斥美帝拒绝和平谈判
  　拥护斯大林的回信
    捷报盛赞苏联坚持和平政策
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】纽约讯：华莱士十一日在旧金山广播电台演讲时，接获斯大林复信，即以充满着感情的颤抖的声调说：“我高兴极了，简直说不出话来。斯大林认为我的公开信是争取国际和平的最重要文件给予评论，实际上是苏联总理向建议和平的美国人民所发表的声明；斯大林这种异乎寻常的公开复信，是紧跟着最近美苏照会以后的行动，是美苏间真正谈判和平的开始。”在此以前，华莱士曾于广播中谴责美政府拒绝与苏联公开谈判说：莫、史照会曾意味着美苏两国间的分歧有解决的希望，但这种希望已被华盛顿方面拒绝了。“苏联表示需要和平破坏了华尔街军事集团的计划，这个集团害怕和平犹如我们大家害怕战争一样。”
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】布拉格讯：捷克舆论盛赞斯大林对华莱士公开信的复文。捷真理报社论力称：斯大林的回信将为世界千千万万渴望和平的人民所赞扬。这一回答说明了苏联是坚持和平并为和平而斗争的唯一大国。“自由言论报”说：“自莫洛托夫与斯大林提出复文后，目前国际形势应由美国负全责。因为苏联已竭尽所能以保证与巩固和平，及革除一切的分歧”。
