Sanhe Village Loan for Disaster Relief
Insufficient Care for Wrongly Struggled Against Middle Peasants in the Struggle Against Errors

[Ji-Lu-Yu News] In Sanhe Village, Ninth District of Changyuan, more than half of the eighty-odd households had nothing to eat during the Spring Festival. In the first month, most subsisted on turnips, and later, most ate tree leaves and wild vegetables. On the evening of April 26th, district cadres held a mass meeting in the village to explain that the government would issue disaster relief grain loans, calling on everyone to fight against the disaster, to ensure that not an acre of land was left uncultivated and no one starved to death, and to ensure that the loans were given to the farmers most severely affected by the disaster. The district cadres also reviewed that in the past, the loans had only followed the cadre line, causing the masses to suffer greatly. They explained that this time they would resolutely change this practice. The next day, at dawn, the cadres went down in separate groups, some to investigate the situation in depth, and some to stabilize the emotions of the cadres, emphasizing that the village cadres should care about the suffering of the disaster-stricken farmers. After deliberation, it was determined that 36 disaster-stricken households needed loans. Some reported too much in their self-reporting, and the leaders pointed out that this loan was for disaster relief, and our goal was to prevent starvation and land abandonment, not large-scale production loans. After enlightenment, the masses said that it was not up to anyone to report how much they wanted, it had to be evaluated. So, evaluation committee members were elected to conduct the evaluation. They called on everyone to speak fairly, no household that should be lent to should be left out, and no household that should not be lent to should be added. The evaluation lasted two evenings, and the results of the evaluation were distributed entirely according to the severity of the disaster and the production situation. Those who borrowed more, such as Cheng Dongcheng, a family of four with fifteen acres of newly divided land, borrowed 15,000 yuan. He Yitang, who was less affected by the disaster, also a family of four with sixteen acres of newly divided land, borrowed 12,000 yuan. Among the 36 poor peasant households, Cao Fawen and Cheng Dongming were lazy people who liked to eat and drink well; Mu Xinji, Wang Guangju and other four people were relatively lazy. During the evaluation, the evaluation members felt that they were lending him too much money, and he would waste it. Some evaluation members were afraid of offending the lazy people, saying, "Let's lend him a little less!" At that time, the lazy people were called in to educate them to produce in the future, explaining that if they did not express their attitude, they would not be given a loan. The lazy people expressed their determination to change in the future and produce well, and admitted their mistakes at the mass meeting before they were approved for a loan. After evaluating these 36 households, they checked and found that seven old middle peasant households also had nothing to eat, and three wrongly struggled against middle peasants, including Mu Eryuan, were also starving. The leaders persuaded the masses to lend them money. Those who were severely affected by the disaster were also lent 15,000 yuan per household. Finally, the loan list and figures were announced at the mass meeting, totaling 215 jin of relief grain for 14 households with 26 widowed, orphaned, and childless people without labor. Thirty-two households of new and old middle peasants and poor peasants borrowed a total of 426,000 yuan. Middle peasant Mu ×× said: "In the past, some people spread rumors that the Land Law would extract from middle peasants and struggle against middle peasants. Seeing that the superiors are lending money to disaster-stricken middle peasants at this time, they still can't struggle against middle peasants. In the future, we must produce well." Now the whole village is actively engaged in various productions.

(Editor's note: In Sanhe Village's loan, the care for the wrongly struggled against middle peasants is not attentive enough. The news reflects that only after the 36 poor households were evaluated was it mentioned that three wrongly struggled against middle peasants were starving. Obviously, the attention given to the wrongly struggled against was not taken seriously. It is hoped that this point can be re-examined.)

    三合村贷款救灾
    对错斗中农照顾不够
    【冀鲁豫消息】长垣九区三合村，共有八十余户，二分之一以上过年时就没啥吃了，正月大部用蔓菁充饥，以后大多数都是吃树叶、野菜。四月二十六日晚，区干部在村召开了群众大会，说明政府要发救济粮贷款，号召大家与灾荒作斗争，要作到不荒一亩地，不饿死一口人，把款要贷到灾难重的农民手里。区干并检讨了过去贷款只走了干部路线，使群众吃了大亏。说明这次要坚决的转变这种作风。第二天一明，干部就分头下去，有的深入了解情况，有的安定干部情绪，强调村干要关心受灾农民痛苦。经酝酿后，确定卅六户受灾户须贷款，自报中有多报的，领导提出这次贷款是为的救灾，不饿死人不荒地是我们的目的，而不是大量的生产贷款。经过启发后，群众说谁想报多少不算数，还得评议。于是就选举评议委员评议。并号召大家按公道说话，该贷的不掉一户，不该贷的一户不添。共评议了两个黄昏，评议结果完全按灾情轻重及生产情况进行分配，贷的多的如程东成四口人新分十五亩地，贷洋一万五千元。灾情较轻的何壹堂，也是四口人新分了十六亩地，贷洋一万二千元。在卅六户贫农中，曹法文、程东明是懒汉，好吃好喝；比较懒的轻点的有穆心计、王广聚等四人。在评议时评议员就觉得贷给他的款子多了，他浪费了还是没法。有的评议员不敢得罪懒汉，说少贷给他点吧！当时就把懒汉叫去，教育他们今后要生产起来，说明他们如不表明态度就不给贷。懒汉表明今后决心改变好好生产，并在群众会上承认了错误，才批准他们贷款。把这三十六户评议完后，又检查一下有老中农七户也没啥吃，还有错斗中农穆二元等三户也饿着，领导上说服群众贷给他们款。灾情重的同样每户贷给一万五千元。最后在群众会上公布了贷款名单和数字，计共救济鳏寡孤独无劳力者十四户廿六口人，发救济粮二百一十五斤。三十二户新老中农及贫农，共贷款四十二万六千元。中农穆××说：“过去有人造谣说土地法上要抽中农斗中农咧，看这时上级贷给受灾中农款，还是斗不了中农，以后可得好好生产。”现在全村正在积极进行各种生产中。
    （编者按：三合村贷款中对错斗中农的照顾是注意不够的。消息中反映，三十六户贫苦户评议完后，才提到三户错斗中农在饿着，这样，显然是没把照顾错斗当回事。这一点希能再作检查。）
