    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Council of Ministers decided on the 3rd to issue the Third Soviet National Economic Post-War Reconstruction Bond, with a term of twenty years and a total amount of 20 billion rubles, in order to mobilize the people's financial resources to complete the decisively important third year of the post-war Five-Year Plan and to complete the entire Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in terms of economy and culture. As soon as this new decision of the Soviet government was promulgated, the people immediately rushed to subscribe. The famous writer Gorbatov said: The new bond means new factories, workshops, power stations, schools, welfare, and a happy life for millions of Soviet peasants, workers, and professionals. Fadeyev subscribed to 65,000 rubles, Simonov 53,000, Ehrenburg 20,000, and Panferov purchased bonds worth 25,000 rubles, half of his Stalin Prize money.

　　争取提前完成全部五年计划
  　苏发行善后复兴公债
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议于三日决定发行为期二十年的第三期苏联国民经济善后复兴公债，总额二百亿卢布，以便动员人民的财力，完成战后五年计划中有决定意义的第三年计划，并在经济与文化方面提前完成全部五年计划。当苏联政府这一新决定刚一颁布，人民立即踊跃认购。名作家郭尔巴托夫说：新公债意味着给千百万苏维埃农民、工人、与职业者以新的工厂、作坊、动力站、学校、福利与幸福的生活。法捷耶夫认购了六万五千卢布，西蒙诺夫五万三千，爱伦堡二万，潘菲洛夫以斯大林奖金之半的二万五千卢布购买公债。莫斯科“力”发电厂在听到广播电台宣布政府决定后半小时内，各部门百分之七十三的工人，便以全月工资的百分之五十六认购了公债。
