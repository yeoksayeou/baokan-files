Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 21st. Liberated soldiers from the Wanxi Campaign are exposing the crimes of local Chiang bandit leaders like Xue Bingling, who forced peasants to become bandits. These soldiers are all poor peasants who were forced to become "Regular Soldiers" or "Reserve Soldiers" and had to bring their own food and clothing. Zhang Fakui, a transportation soldier from the Fifth Battalion of the Neixiang First Regiment, said: "When we gathered last October, my family was already starving, but in addition to bringing our own food, we were forced to carry 150 catties of firewood from home." Dong Tianlu, a soldier from the Second Company, was forced to become a cook because his family had no food, eating the leftovers of others. He was dissatisfied with this and said a few idle words, for which the platoon leader made him kneel for the time it takes to burn two incense sticks. Wang Yunsheng's grandson, Fa, from Hoya Village, didn't want to be a soldier and ran away, so his whole family was driven out and the gate was sealed. In the militia, soldiers who ran away were often shot if caught, and someone from their family was grabbed to replace them. Wang Mingshan, a soldier from the Seventh Battalion, tearfully recounted that his brother ran away last October and was caught and executed on the same day. Soon after, he was also grabbed. Chen Guoyun from Erlangping was caught and shot after running away, and his 42-year-old brother, Chen Guoju, was grabbed to replace him. Zhao Yougen, a wounded soldier abandoned by the bandit militia in the Battle of Xixiakou, who we took in, said angrily: "Eating your own food, wearing your own clothes, selling your life for others (local Chiang bandit leaders), and they don't care at all if you get hurt." Wang Quanshan's wife said to her husband, who was being treated in the hospital after being taken in by us: "Oh heavens! If it weren't for the Liberation Army, I don't know where you'd be sleeping!" These wounded soldiers said that they were all forced to the front lines. The adjutant and others of Yang Zixi, the head of the First Regiment, used guns to block them from behind, killing anyone who retreated. But because everyone was unwilling to die, they scattered after a brief engagement. When the main force of the First Regiment, the Third Battalion, broke through from Xixiakou, as soon as they left the city gate and a gunshot rang out, the entire battalion couldn't gather a single person, and they all scattered.

　　宛西战役解放士兵揭露蒋匪抓丁罪行
    【新华社宛西前线二十一日电】宛西解放民团士兵，纷纷揭露土蒋匪头子薛炳灵等强迫农民为匪的罪行。这些士兵都是贫苦农民，被强迫编为“常备兵”或“预备兵”，并须自带伙食衣服。内乡保一团五营运输兵张法魁说：去年十月集合时，他一家已饿着肚皮，但除了自带粮食外还强迫从家里担去一百五十斤烧柴。第二连士兵董天禄家里没有粮食，就被逼着当伙夫，吃别人的残汤剩饭，他因此不满，说了两句闲话，就被排长罚跪了两柱香。后窑村王运升孙子法不愿当兵逃走，全家都被赶出，把大门封了。在民团中，跑的士兵一经捉住常遭枪毙，并另抓他家里的人顶替。七营士兵汪明山哭诉着他哥哥去年十月逃跑回来，当日就被捉去枪决，不久他也被抓来了。二朗坪陈国云逃走后被抓回枪决，并抓了他四十二岁的哥哥陈国巨顶替。西峡口战斗中被匪民团所遗弃为我收容的伤兵赵有根愤恨的说：“吃上自己的饭，穿上自己的衣，给人家（土蒋匪头）卖性命，挂了彩他们全不管。”王全善的女人对被我收容在医院里治疗的丈夫说：“天爷呀！要不是解放军，还不晓得你在哪里睡着！”这些伤兵说，他们都是被迫驱上火线的，一团团长杨子锡的副官等人都在他们后面用枪堵住他们，谁退就打死谁，但是因为大家不愿送死，因此还是稍经接触就一哄而散，一团主力第三营自西峡口突围时，一出城门，枪声一响，全营就一个人也集合不起来，各自逃散了。
