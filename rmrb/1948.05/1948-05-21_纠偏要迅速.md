　　Correcting Deviations Must Be Swift

　　Yang Zhenxing of the Xiwangzhao work group and the Dalucheng work group in Qinyang, incited beatings in the mass movement, even personally engaging in arbitrary and reckless actions, undermining policy principles, and losing the sympathy of the masses. After discovering this principled error, the Qinyang leadership immediately and swiftly corrected it. This spirit is worth promoting and advocating.

　　In the past, due to our insufficient understanding of the situation and insufficient study of policies, and unclear policy boundaries, we made many principled errors in the implementation of policies, seriously damaging the interests of the masses and becoming detached from the masses. This should be taken as a lesson. These errors must be quickly and unconditionally corrected in order to straighten out policies and closely integrate with the masses. Chairman Mao taught us in his speech at the cadre meeting in Jin-Sui: "The Jin-Sui Central Bureau took appropriate steps in January of this year to correct 'leftist' deviations. This step was implemented after the comrades of the Bureau returned from attending the Central December meeting. The Bureau issued five directives for this purpose. This step to correct deviations was so in line with the demands of the masses, and so swift and thorough, that almost all 'leftist' deviations were corrected in a short period of time." Now, some of our comrades, on the contrary, believe that correcting deviations is too "fierce," and turning the corner too "fast," advocating a slow approach. This understanding is incorrect. We have made errors in policy principles and have already taken a detour. If we do not correct them quickly, the masses will move further away from us, and the detour will become larger. This is a significant loss for the Party and the people. Only by resolutely, swiftly, and immediately unconditionally correcting deviations can we prevent deviations from developing and guide the implementation of policies towards righteousness.

　　纠偏要迅速
    沁阳西王召工作组、大芦城工作组杨振兴，在群众运动中，鼓动打人，甚至亲自动手包办蛮干，破坏了政策原则，失掉了群众的同情。这一带有原则性的错误，沁阳领导上发觉后，即刻迅速加以纠正，这种精神，值得发扬与提倡。
    过去在执行政策上由于我们了解情况不够，和对于政策研究不够，政策界限不分明，致使工作上犯了不少原则错误，严重地损害了群众利益，脱离了群众，应当引为教训。这些错误，必须迅速的无条件的加以纠正，才能使政策端正过来，紧密的同群众结合。毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话里教导我们说：“晋绥中央分局在今年一月采取了纠正左的偏向的适当步骤。这个步骤是在分局同志参加中央十二月会议回来以后实行的。分局为此发出了五项指示。这一纠正偏向的步骤，如此适合群众的要求，又如此迅速和贯彻，在短时期内，几乎一切左的偏向都已纠正过来了。”现在我们有一些同志，反而认为纠正偏向太“猛”了，转弯子太“快”了，主张慢慢的来。这种认识是不对的。我们犯了政策原则上的错误，已经走了弯路，如不迅速纠正，群众就离开我们越远，弯子绕得越大。对党和人民都是重大的损失。只有坚决，迅速，立即无条件的纠正偏向，才能使偏向无从发展，引导政策的执行走向端正。
