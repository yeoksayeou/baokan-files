　　Snippets of American Imperialist Aggression Against China
　　◇ The Yaroad Artificial Silk Company has established a branch in Shanghai, preparing to produce artificial silk on a large scale and dump it in China for profit. American technicians are currently managing the installation of American-style machinery in the factory. In mid-May, the American imperialist government also awarded so-called "Navy Lieutenant Commander-level Medals" to six senior special agents of the Dai Li system who held "important positions in the Sino-American Cooperative Organization Training Class, a joint US-Chiang special agent organization in China," to reward them for their cruel massacre of the Chinese people and their meritorious "achievements" in serving American imperialist aggression against China. The medals were personally awarded by American imperialist aggression agent, John Leighton Stuart.
　　◇ The commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet stationed in Qingdao, Badger, publicly declared at a press conference in Shanghai on the 18th of last month that his fleet headquarters was not fixed in Qingdao. (All Chinese coastal ports, as well as Japan and the Philippines, are its stationing locations.) This shows that the Chiang bandits have in fact sold all the usage rights of China's coastal ports to their American masters.
　　◇ An American named Godwin was recently appointed as the "Foreign Liaison Officer" of the Chiang bandit Resource Committee, representing American imperialists to supervise the work of the committee. The US Department of Justice publicly announced Godwin's position at the beginning of this month.

　　美帝侵华零讯
    ◇亚劳德人造丝公司已在上海设立分公司，准备大规模制造人造丝，在华倾销牟利。美国技师刻正在该厂管理美式机器之装置。上月中旬美帝政府并以所谓“海军中校级勋章授予曾在美蒋在华联合特务机构中美合作训练班”担任“要职”的六名原戴笠系统高级特务，以奖励他们残酷屠杀中国人民，和为美帝侵华服务的功“绩”。该项勋章系由美帝侵华代理人司徒雷登亲自授予。
    ◇驻青美帝西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔，曾于上月十八日在上海记者招待会上公开宣称其舰队司令部并不固定在青岛一处。（凡中国沿海各口岸及日本菲律宾等地，皆为其驻札地点。）显示蒋匪实际上已将中国沿海港口使用权全部出卖给其美国主子。
    ◇美人戈德温近任蒋匪资源委员会“对外联络专员”，代表美帝监督该会工作，美国司法部已于本月初公开宣布戈德温此项职务。
