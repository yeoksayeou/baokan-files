　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 28th. After land reform eliminated feudal exploitation, how to organize peasants to utilize their surplus labor immediately became the first important issue in rural areas. For this issue, Daixian, on the banks of the Hutuo River in northern Shanxi, provided noteworthy experience. Daixian is currently organizing land reclamation, canal construction, and mass sideline production. In some rural areas, after land reform, some peasants had 30 percent surplus labor. For example, Li Nianwang, a poor peasant in Yukou Village, had three family members. Before land reform, he had two mu of flat land and rented fourteen mu of landlord's land. After land reform, he was allocated eight and a half mu, which was nearly half of his original cultivated land. On the one hand, feudal exploitation was eliminated, and cultivation income increased; but on the other hand, because the land was not enough for him and his wife's surplus labor to be utilized, these peasants complained that "there is not enough land to cultivate" and felt idle, especially in the plains along the Hutuo River, where there is little land and a dense population, resulting in more surplus labor than elsewhere. Therefore, recently, farmers' representative meetings in various places have been organizing peasants to reclaim land, build canals, and develop sideline occupations to find outlets for surplus labor. Yukou Village, near the mountains, has a total of 320 households and has decided that each household should reclaim at least one mu of wasteland, and the whole village should strive to reclaim 1,000 mu. Xuanren Village only had 200 mu of paddy fields last year, but this year it has been expanded to 1,200 mu, which can increase rice production by 500 to 600 shi. The village has now built an 8-li long, 7-zhang wide, and 4-chi deep canal, and plans to also convert nearby wasteland into paddy fields. In terms of sideline occupations, the county's saltpeter boiling industry has also developed more recently. The county seat alone has 340 saltpeter boiling pots, producing more than 20,000 jin per month. Other sideline occupations such as salt boiling, alkali boiling, and straw hat weaving have also increased.

　　晋绥组织剩余劳动开展群众副业生产
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】在土地改革消灭了封建剥削以后，怎样组织农民利用自己的剩余劳动随即成为农村中第一个重要问题。对于这个问题，山西北部滹沱河畔的代县提供了可注意的经验。代县刻正组织开荒、修渠及群众副业生产。有些农村在土地改革后，有的农民的剩余劳动力百分之三十，如峪口村贫农李年旺，全家三口人，土地改革以前，有平地二亩，另租种地主地十四亩；土地改革以后，分地八亩半，较原耕地少了近一半，这样一方面是去掉了封建剥削，耕种收入增加了；但另一方面又因土地不够他和他老婆的剩余劳动力无处发挥，这类农民就喊着“地不够种”，感到身闲无事，尤以滹沱河两岸平川地少人稠，剩余劳动力较别处更多。为此最近各地农民代表会，都在组织农民开荒修渠，及发展副业，为剩余劳动力找出路。峪口村靠近山边，共三百二十户，决定每户至少开荒一亩，全村争取开荒一千亩。选仁村去年仅有稻田二百亩，今年扩大为一千二百亩，可增产稻五百至六百石。该村现已兴修长八里，宽七丈，深四尺之水渠，拟将附近荒地亦辟为稻畦。在副业方面，该县熬硝业近亦较前发展，仅县城熬硝锅已达三百四十口，月产二万斤以上，其他如熬盐、熬咸、编草帽等副业均有增加。
