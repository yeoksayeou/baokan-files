Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 15th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 13th, US Third Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace, after the exchange of notes between the US and the Soviet Union, released an "Open Letter to Premier Stalin" to the press, requesting the reconstruction of US-Soviet cooperation and calling for the withdrawal of US troops from China and the non-interference of the United States in China's internal affairs.

Wallace began his letter by stating: "Although the notes from Ambassador Smith and Foreign Minister Molotov still maintain opposing viewpoints, they undoubtedly offer significant hope to those who firmly believe that peace is possible; to those propagandists who insist that the two countries cannot coexist peacefully in the same world, it is a severe blow. Both notes affirm our long-held view that wartime cooperation between the two great powers can be rebuilt and strengthened in peacetime. The exchange of notes opens the door to negotiations, which should be followed by frank and open meetings between US and Soviet representatives."

Next, Wallace presented his "Century of Peace Plan," stating: The US and the Soviet Union must immediately take concrete and decisive measures to achieve the following goals: universal disarmament, cessation of arms exports, restoration of unrestricted trade between the two countries, and the establishment of some organization under the United Nations to distribute international relief. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union should interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; neither should maintain military bases in other United Nations countries; neither should intimidate citizens of other United Nations member states by assembling land forces, establishing air bases, or deploying naval fleets; neither should use financial, economic, or espionage pressure to gain political advantages in other countries. The US and the Soviet Union should cooperate sincerely in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter to promote the sound political, economic, and cultural development of the world. To this end, within the framework of the United Nations, Europe should be given the maximum possible economic assistance as quickly as possible, depending on the extent of war damage and economic needs, and the "European Economic Cooperation Administration" and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe should be transformed as soon as possible into a powerful and broad-based United Nations organization to build a highly developed and economically unified Europe. The Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France should conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible in order to establish a peace-loving, unified German government that strictly adheres to the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements. "Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union should supply arms to China. The troops of both countries should withdraw from China (Editor's note: Currently only the US imperialist troops stationed in China have not withdrawn) and Korea. A government should be established throughout Korea as soon as possible. The US and the Soviet Union should, while respecting China's sovereignty, adhere to the principle of equal rights for all countries in China and never interfere in China's internal affairs. A strong and unified China based on political and economic democracy is beneficial to both the US and the Soviet Union." A peace treaty with Japan should be reached as soon as possible in accordance with the original agreement, and all occupying forces should withdraw from Japan one year after the signing of the peace treaty. As long as trust is established on all major issues, the veto power and the issue of atomic energy control can be handled constructively. The door should be opened quickly to allow atomic energy to bring extraordinary benefits to mankind in peace.

Wallace concluded his letter by stating: "The competition between communism and capitalism is one thing, and the misunderstanding between the US and the Soviet Union is another. The latter can be resolved by maintaining peace. The US and the Soviet Union can seek agreement on the basis of a provisional treaty, while on the other hand, the slow evolution of time will determine the merits of the two economic systems, and the free nations of the world will make their choices in their daily lives. There are no misunderstandings or difficulties between the US and the Soviet Union that must be resolved by force or intimidation, nor are there any differences that cannot be resolved by peaceful and hopeful negotiations."

　　华莱士致斯大林公开信
    要求美苏重建合作
  　反对美军驻华干涉中国内政
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据塔斯社纽约十三日电：美第三党总统候选人华莱士，于美苏照会发表后向报界发表“致斯大林总理的公开信”，要求美苏重建合作，呼吁美军撤出中国和美国不干涉中国内政。
    华莱士在信中首称：“虽然史密斯大使与莫洛托夫外长的照会，仍旧各持一方的理由，但它们对那些坚认和平是可能的人们说来，确不失为一个重大的希望；对那些力言两国不能在同一世界上和平共处的宣传家，则不啻一个严重的打击。双方的照会都断定了我们久已具有的见解，而两大强国间战时的合作，是能够在和平时期重建与加强的。照会的交换，打开了谈判之门，接着就应该举行美苏代表开诚布公的会议。”
    接着，华莱士在信中提出了“百年和平方案”的意见说：美苏必须立即采取确切而有决定性的措施，以期达到下列目标，即：普遍缩军，停止输出武器，恢复两国间无限制的贸易，建立联合国下某种组织，进行国际救济的分配。无论美国或苏联，均不得干涉他国内政；不得在其他联合国国家内保持军事基地；不得以集结陆军、建立空军基地或海军舰队游弋来恫吓其他联合国会员国的公民；不得利用财政经济或特务压力，在别国获取政治果实。美苏两国应根据联合国宪章精神，竭诚合作，以促进世界之政治、经济与文化的健全发展。为达此目的，在联合国范围内，视战争破坏与经济需要的程度，尽速予欧洲以最大限度的经济上帮助，尽快把“欧洲经济合作执行处”与联合国欧洲经济委员会转变为有力而广泛联总，以建设生产力高度发展与经济上统一的欧洲。苏美英法应尽早缔结对德和约，以便尽速建立严格履行雅尔塔与波茨顿协定的爱好和平的统一的德国政府。“无论美国或苏联，均不应输送武器至中国。两国军队应自中国（编者按：现仅美帝国主义驻华军队尚未撤退）与朝鲜撤退。尽速建立全鲜的政府。美苏两国应在尊重中国主权下，信守各国在华平等权利的原则，绝不干涉中国内政。一个在政治与经济民主的基础上强盛而统一的中国，对美苏两国均属有利。”依据原有协议尽早达成对日和约，所有占领军于和约签字一年没从日本撤退。只要在各重大问题上确立了信任，否决权与原子能管制问题都可能作建设性的处理。应当迅速把大门打开，使原子能在和平中给人类带来非常的利益。
    华莱士在信末认为：“共产主义与资本主义之间的竞争和美苏的误解是两回事。后者可以用保持和平的方法解决之。美苏两国可以根据一个暂定条约求得协议，同时在另一方面，时间的慢慢演进，会决定两个经济制度的好坏，而全世界各自由民族则在日常生活中进行选择。美苏之间并没有必须武力或恐吓才能解决的误解或困难，也没有不能以和平而有希望的谈判解决的分歧。”
