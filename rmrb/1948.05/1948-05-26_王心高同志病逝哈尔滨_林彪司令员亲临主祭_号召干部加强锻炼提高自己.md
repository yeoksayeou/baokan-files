Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: Comrade Wang Xingao, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Ninth Column of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, suffered from stomach cancer. Despite various treatments by doctors, he unfortunately passed away at 8:30 AM on the 7th of this month at the Harbin Garrison Hospital. A public memorial service was held by people from all walks of life in Harbin at the city's Martyrs Memorial Hall on December 12th. Commander Lin Biao personally presided over the ceremony, accompanied by Deputy Commanders Xiao Jingguang and Zhou Baozhong, Director Tan Zheng, and Chief of Staff Liu Yalou. Commander Lin spoke before the remains, pointing out that Comrade Xingao had started as an ordinary soldier fifteen years ago, accumulating a lot of work experience in a down-to-earth manner. After fifteen years of arduous struggle, it could be said that he had attended a military school for fifteen years, until he assumed the responsibility of a column-level position today. Such cadres are rare. Veteran cadres are the backbone of the revolutionary cause and the most valuable wealth of the Party and the people, but the number of veteran cadres is decreasing day by day, and the revolutionary cause is expanding day by day. How many leading cadres do the 450 million people of China need? Veteran cadres are very valuable to the revolutionary cause, and the Party cherishes them very much. The Party's cherishment begins with politically improving them, strengthening their political education, especially their professional education, and then taking more care of them in terms of life and health. This should be the case for Party committees and cadres at all levels without exception. On the other hand, veteran cadres themselves should also work hard to train themselves, absorb new experiences, give full play to old experiences, carefully study new problems, and actively find ways to overcome difficulties, constantly improving themselves, and not becoming fatigued because of old age, and not stubbornly adhering to and conservatively sticking to old experiences. Commander Lin continued, pointing out that veteran cadres are becoming fewer and fewer, their responsibilities are becoming heavier and heavier, and the revolutionary cause is developing day by day, so it is necessary to remedy this loss. The way to remedy it is on the one hand, for veteran cadres to improve themselves, and at the same time, to promote a large number of new cadres, be good at training new cadres, and teach them experience, so that the revolutionary cause can continue to develop and continue to proceed. After the memorial ceremony, the leaders and guests personally escorted the remains, passing through the city streets to the cemetery in the Xiangfang suburbs for burial. Comrade Wang Xingao was born in 1917 in a farmer's family in Langzhong County, Sichuan Province. He came from a student background and joined the revolution in 1933, working as a propagandist in the Fourth Front Army. Later, he served as a soldier, squad leader, clerk, propaganda captain, staff officer, section chief, etc. In 1937, he served as the Chief of the Propaganda Section of the Political Department of the 129th Division. In 1938, he served as the Political Commissar of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Jinnan Military Region and the Director of the Political Department of the First Regiment. From 1940 to 1944, he studied at the Yan'an Military and Political College and the Central Party School. In 1944, he served as the Chief of the Propaganda Section of the Political Department of the New Fourth Brigade. In 1945, he was elected to attend the Seventh National Congress of the Party. At the end of 1945, he served as the Minister of Propaganda of the Political Department of the Jidong Military Region. In 1947, he served as the Minister of Organization of the Ninth Column, and at the beginning of this year, he served as the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Column.
