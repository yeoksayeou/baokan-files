　　Changzhi Municipal Party Committee Holds Expanded Cadre Meeting
　　Begins Inspection of Industrial and Commercial Policies
　　Large Merchants Visit Less, “Lean Months” Arrive Early
　　Fails to Consider Developing Production, Thinks Higher Wages Are Fine
　　Pursuit of "Getting Organized" Hits a Wall and Collapses
　　[Changzhi News] In order to correctly accept and implement the Taihang District Party Committee's instructions on urban policy, protect and develop industry and commerce, and develop urban production, Changzhi City held an expanded cadre meeting with more than 120 participants from April 8th to 17th to review past work and the implementation of policies, and to determine future work directions.
　　In the first phase of the meeting, the urban economic policy was studied. In principle, the general cadres acknowledged that industry and commerce should be protected and that the problems of the poor should be solved mainly by developing production and promoting market prosperity. It was wrong to fight industry and commerce for the sake of turning over. However, since most of the cadres grew up in rural work, the influence of old ideas was very deep, and their understanding of urban policies was insufficient, which was specifically manifested in the fact that some comrades agreed in principle, but could not understand specific issues. For example, regarding the protection of landlords' industry and commerce, they felt that it was making it easy for the landlords, "benefiting both ends." Some said, "It is feasible to implement urban policies in Changzhi City in the future. The general citizens have almost turned over, but it will not work in newly recovered cities" (meaning that they cannot turn over without fighting industry and commerce). Some advocated that "it is okay not to fight industry and commerce economically, but we must knock down their prestige." Others said, "Developing industry and commerce is protecting the interests of capitalists and landlords, which is always uncomfortable."
　　The leadership guided everyone to understand the urban policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, mainly from two aspects. On the one hand, from the perspective of the nature and future of the revolution at this stage, this stage is indispensable. In general, cadres accepted this point abstractly and with difficulty. On the other hand, from the cadres' own experiences: the characteristic of urban life is reliance on the market. When the market is prosperous, citizens have more "ways to live" and can make money everywhere, so life is good; conversely, when the market is depressed and there are no production channels, citizens' lives are difficult. The prosperity or depression of the market depends on whether industry and commerce are developed. The cadres easily accepted this point by understanding the consistency among citizens' lives, the market, and industry and commerce, which was proven by many practical experiences. For example, the cadres of the Third District reviewed that they had fought a paint shop on East Street in the past. A lot of paint was pulled out in many carts and scattered to the masses. The colors were all messed up with ink, which was of little help to the lives of the masses, but greatly increased their difficulties. In addition, the fewer large merchants came and went, and no one collected fur, causing the price of fur to drop, so that the "lean months" of business came two months earlier than usual, making it difficult for nearly 4,000 Hui people in the First District who made a living from the fur trade to even pay the unified progressive tax. Also, because the public-owned commercial ended, there were fewer people coming and going, and the business of small vendors was not as good as before. Fewer people ate noodles, so there were not many mills, and porters could not find work, and the business of shops suddenly became deserted. After the public-owned shops ended this time, everyone deeply realized that it was difficult for the masses on a street to raise funds to take over an ordinary agency shop, including the house and goods. It has become impossible to restore the industry and commerce that was defeated in the past with the financial resources of the masses today. Everyone has understood many problems from this point of view.
　　The second phase of the meeting was to review the work on the basis of preliminary acceptance of the policy. In the review of the labor-capital two-benefit policy, it was found that general wages were relatively high. In the Second District, the hired labor in general shops and workshops, in addition to food, had a monthly salary and bonus totaling at least eight dou and at most one shi and five dou, with the average being one shi and two dou. Calculated at one shi and two dou, the annual income was fourteen shi and eight dou. In addition to the individual eating at the store, it was enough to support the food and clothing of a family of three. Such a wage standard was too high except for particularly good workers. In particular, shop assistants and apprentices received the same bonus in addition to a salary of four dou. In the Third District, this was calculated to be eight or nine dou, which could support two people in addition to their own food in the store. Due to the excessive wages and bonuses of shop assistants and apprentices, shops generally do not want to hire shop assistants or take apprentices now, because the wages and bonuses are similar to those of purchasing and sales, but the role in work is different, which is a loss to the cultivation of industrial and commercial operating skills. However, everyone had a very poor understanding of this point in the meeting. Although the leadership pointed out that high wages are destructive to industrial and commercial production, development, and construction, and after specific calculations, the general comrades also admitted that they were somewhat high, they still felt "it doesn't matter if they are a little higher" psychologically. Although the leadership finally pointed out that such thinking was wrong, we still need to make great efforts to correctly implement the two-benefit policy. In addition, it was unanimously clarified that: in organized production, those who are mainly labor must take care of labor, and those who are mainly capital must take care of capital. Only in this way can we achieve labor-capital two-benefit.
　　The meeting reviewed the situation of "getting organized" in urban production and found the following unreasonable phenomena: First, emphasizing that everything should be organized, and mechanically organizing some productions that are suitable for family units. For example, for making tofu in the suburbs, the capital and labor required are not large, and the production tools, small pots and small mills, can only help those who have tools but no labor, or those who have labor but no tools; however, our district cadres organized ten or eight people together, which hindered production and caused a lot of opinions. Some people were afraid of joining the production team and did not grind tofu for half a year. Later, the masses still did their own work secretly, with only a formal "team" to deal with the inspection of the district cadres. Second, regardless of the nature of the business, the masses' production was forced together. For example, in the loan in Xin'nan Street last winter, the district cadres organized five people who sprouted soybeans, sold used clothes, were bookbinders, and ground flour into a soybean sprouting group, which collapsed in less than a month. The reason was that the person who sprouted soybeans originally sprouted two dou per day, and it only increased to two dou and five sheng with the addition of three people, and there were no sales if there were more. Third, starting solely from the task, pursuing advanced forms, emphasizing scale, emphasizing large-scale, street-wide, and lane-wide. Last winter in the First District, whoever made money from a joint venture, the cadres held a general meeting to call on the masses to invest. A workshop in Nanjie made one million from a capital of 100,000 last year, so everyone invested. People were afraid of being called "selfish" and dared not refuse; however, due to the specific conditions of technology, market, storefront, etc., the original funds were enough, and more funds would reduce profits relatively. Fourth, many cadres mechanically and one-sidedly emphasized that poor hired laborers should be in power, causing many production departments to lose money and hurting small business owners and handicraftsmen. Three production departments in Xiadong Street closed down because they were replaced by poor people who lacked technical and management experience to be managers. In the meeting, everyone jointly exposed and criticized past mistakes, and unified their understanding under the general policy of "developing production and prospering the economy."
　　The third phase of the meeting, after accepting the policy and reviewing the shortcomings, the Municipal Party Committee arranged for the next stage of work based on the opinions discussed by everyone. First, in accordance with the urban policy, vigorously publicize the protection of industry and commerce, protect private capital, and solve the masses' general "fear of development" mentality; publicize that there will be no equal distribution in the city in the future, and eliminate the citizens' thinking of waiting for equal distribution and waiting for struggles. At the same time, specific problems must be solved. For example, some streets that have put industrialists and businessmen under control and prepared for struggle must return their capital and restore their freedom of production. Second, vigorously organize factories, workshops, handicrafts, vendors, and all commercial production, combined with agriculture. The leadership's focus should be on serving the countryside from the city, and on handicraft production. The labor-capital two-benefit policy should be generally reviewed, investigated and researched step by step, to solve the excessively high wages, and stop the behavior and measures that harm handicraftsmen, small business owners, and industrialists and businessmen. Then it was pointed out that there is indeed a part of urban production that cannot be organized. For example, if the capital required is small, the labor is small, the family labor is sufficient, and the sales are limited, the mechanical organization must be corrected.
　　This meeting has achieved certain results, but the understanding is still not consolidated and not clear enough. Therefore, at the end of the meeting, it was emphasized that: 1. Establish and improve the working system, strengthen work inspection, investigation and research, ensure the implementation of various specific regulations of the policy, and handle affairs in accordance with the policy. If you still can't understand something, study it slowly yourself. 2. Among the cadres, focus on the urban policy and arrange for a relatively long-term study plan on the relevant parts of Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government" and the current situation and tasks related to industry and commerce.

### 长治市委召开扩大干部会　着手检查工商业政策

　　长治市委召开扩大干部会
  　着手检查工商业政策
  　大商人来往少“空月”来得早
  　不从发展生产着想认为工资高些没啥
  　追求“组织起来”碰了钉子垮了台
    【长治消息】为正确接受与执行太行区党委对城市政策的指示，保护与发展工商业，发展市民生产，长治市于四月八日至十七日召开一百二十多人的扩大干部会，检查过去工作与对政策的执行情形，并确定今后的工作方针。
    会议第一段，学习城市经济政策，一般干部原则上都承认了工商业要保护，贫民问题主要从发展生产，繁荣市场中求得解决，为翻身而斗争工商业是错误的。但由于干部大部分是从农村工作中生长起来的，旧的观点影响很深，对城市政策了解很不够，具体表现在部分同志原则上同意，具体问题想不通。如对地主工商业的保护，觉得便宜了地主，“两头赶上”。有人说：“长治市今后实行城市政策还可以，一般市民翻身已翻得差不多，但要到新收复城市就行不通”（意思是指不斗工商业翻不了身）。有人主张“对工商业经济上不斗也可以，但要把他的威风打下来”。也有人说：“发展工商业就是保护了资本家老财的利益，总是不舒服”。
    领导上诱导大家了解保护发展工商业的城市政策，主要从两方面。一方面从现阶段革命性质，革命前途上看，非经过这段不可。对这一点，一般干部接受是较空洞与困难的。另一方面从干部亲身体会：市民生活特点是依靠市场，市场繁荣，市民“活路”多，到处能赚钱，生活就好；反之市场萧条，没有生产门路，市民生活就难过。而市场的繁荣与萧条，又决定于工商业是否发达。从市民生活、市场、工商业这三者一致性来想通问题，这一点干部自己用很多实际体会得到证明，容易接受。如三区干部检查过去斗争了东街一座颜料庄，颜料拉出来好多大车，七零八散的分给群众，颜色都是配了墨水乱糟蹋，对群众生活帮助极小，增加的困难却很大。另外，大商人来往少，没人收皮子，皮价下降，使买卖“空月”比常年提早两月来到，使一区近四千经营皮毛业为生的回民困难到统累税也无法交付，也因为公营商业结束，来往人少，小摊贩买卖不如以前。吃面人少了，磨坊也不多，运脚户更是找不到活做，店房生意顿形冷淡。这次公营商店结束，大家都深深体会到：一条街道的群众集资，想把一个普通的机关商店连房带货接受过来，就很难办到。要以今天群众财力恢复以前斗垮的工商业，已经成为不可能，大家从这方面想通不少问题。
    会议第二段，是在初步接受了政策的基础上检查工作。检查劳资两利政策中，发现一般工资较高。在二区，一般商店作坊的雇佣劳力，除管吃外，每月工资分红合起来，最低八斗，最高一石五，普通的是一石二。就一石二计算，全年十四石八。除本人吃在商店外，尚可顾住三口人的吃穿。这样的工资标准，除了特别好的把式外，是过高的。特别是店员学徒，除四斗工资外一样的分红，在三区算下来有八九斗，除自己吃在商店外还能养活两口人。由于店员学徒工资分红过高，现在各商店一般不愿用店员、带学徒，因为工资分红和采购营业差不多，但作起活来作用不一样，这对工商业经营技术的培养是有损失的。但会议中大家对这点认识很差，虽然领导上指出了工资过高，对工商业生产发展建设有破坏性。经具体计算后，一般同志也承认有些高，但心理上总还觉得“高一些没啥”。虽然领导上最后指出那种思想不对，但要两利政策正确执行，还需我们很大努力。此外一致明确了：在组织起来的生产中，以劳为主的，必须照顾劳力，以资为主的，必须照顾资本。只有如此，才能达到劳资两利。
    会议检查了市民生产中“组织起来”的状况，发现下列几种不合理现象：第一、强调一切都组织起来，将一些适合以家庭为单位的生产也机械组织了。例如附城的磨豆腐，需要资本劳力不大，生产工具锅小磨小，最多只能将有工具无劳力，或有劳力无工具的互助起来；但我们区干部把十个八个组织在一起，结果妨碍生产，意见极多。有人害怕加入生产组，半年没磨豆腐，后来群众暗地仍然各干各，只有一个形式上的“组”，用来对付区干部的检查。第二、毫不根据业务性质，将群众生产硬凑到一块。如新南街在去冬贷款中，区干部将发豆芽的，卖估衣的，裱糊匠，及磨面的五人组织起来，叫发豆芽小组，不到一月就垮了。原因是发豆芽的原来每天发二斗，增加了三个人才发二斗五升，再多则无销路。第三、单从任务出发，追求高级形式，讲究规模，强调大型，全街性、全闾性。一区去冬谁的合伙买卖赚了钱，干部就开大会号召群众入股。南街一个作坊，去年十万元资本赚到一百万，大家就入股，人家怕说“自私自利”，不敢不收；但这买卖由于技术、市场、门面等等具体条件限制，原来资金已够用，再多了赚钱就相对减少。第四、不少干部机械片面的强调贫雇掌权，使不少生产部赔钱，刺伤了小商、手工业者。下东街有三个生产部，因换成缺乏技术经营经验的贫民当经理，倒闭了。会议中，大家共同揭发与批判了过去错误，并在“发展生产、繁荣经济”的总方针下，将认识统一起来。
    会议第三段，经过接受政策，检查缺点后，市委根据大家讨论的意见布置了今后的一段工作。首先根据城市政策，大力宣传保护工商业，保护私人资本，解决群众普遍的“怕发展”思想；宣传市内以后不进行平分，扫除市民等待平分，等待闹斗争的思想。同时必须解决具体问题，如有些街将工商业者管制起来，准备斗争的，必须归还资本，恢复其生产自由。其次，大力组织工厂、作坊、手工业、摊贩、及一切商业生产、结合农业。领导重点要从城市为农村服务出发，放在手工业生产上。要普遍的检查劳资两利政策，有步骤的调查研究，解决过高的工资，停止伤害手工业者、小商与工商业者的行为与措施。接着指出，市民生产中，确有一部分是不能组织起来的。如需要资本小，劳力少，家庭劳力够用，销路有限，机械的组织起来必须纠正。
    这一会议有一定成绩，但认识还有不巩固与不够明确之处，因此会议结束时，强调了：一、建立健全的工作制度，加强工作检查，调查研究，保证政策各种具体规定的执行，一定按政策办事，还想不通的地方自己慢慢研究。二、在干部中围绕着城市政策，对毛主席论联合政府，目前形势与任务等文件中有关工商业部分，进行布置一段较长时间的学习计划。
