To the Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:

After reading the People's Daily's April 18th opinions on class division and industry and commerce in Changzhi City, we feel they are very correct. To correct the erroneous policies of Changzhi City in industry and commerce, and to provide the Changzhi Municipal Committee with concrete materials, we are writing about the situation at the Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill. We hope this material can be published in the People's Daily.

There are two different understandings of the Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill: We believe that the Xiangyuan sectarianism among the paper mill workers is very serious, and their economism is rampant; while the Changzhi City Federation of Trade Unions and its Third Branch are fostering and supporting this sectarianism and economism. The Municipal Committee completely believes the false reports from the City Federation of Trade Unions. But the City Federation of Trade Unions believes that the workers' wages are low and that Li Fugui, the deputy factory director sent by the Xinhua Daily, has an undemocratic work style. What is the truth? Here are the facts.

The Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill was originally established by the enemy and puppets. After the liberation of Changzhi, it was taken over by the Shangdang Construction Company. Soon after, it was transferred to the Taihang Paper Industry Company. In March 1946, it was taken over by the Xinhua Daily. At that time, the scale was very small, with only four paper-making vats, one stone mill, and three livestock for power, with a total of sixteen or seventeen workers and staff. In the autumn of 1946, the City Federation of Trade Unions proposed implementing "Labor-Capital Both Benefit" and "Labor-Capital Cooperation." After several months of trial, the factory only had a monthly surplus of more than 20,000 yuan, without deducting depreciation of tools, etc. At that time, the workers' wages, in addition to meals provided by the factory, were more than 20,000 yuan per month, and the factory's surplus was only enough to pay one worker's salary. The so-called "Labor-Capital Both Benefit" was actually one-sided labor benefit and capital loss. This so-called labor-capital benefit method was repeatedly advocated and promoted by the Federation of Trade Unions at the Taihang District Model Workers Conference in 1946, and was selected as a "model factory," producing "heroes" and "model managers." At that time, a responsible comrade from a certain ordnance factory said: "The Xinhua Paper Mill is a light industry with such high wages; we have many more labor heroes like this!"

Last spring, the paper mill expanded production, increasing from the original four paper-making vats to ten vats, and changing from animal power to electric power, with capital increasing to more than ten million yuan (now it has increased to 50 million yuan). At the same time, it was discovered that the original manager had committed embezzlement and corruption, so he was replaced, and the "labor hero" Wu Changhai, a worker in the factory, was boldly promoted to manager. At this time, the wage was ten districts of hemp paper (food outside), worth about 20,000 yuan. At that time, the price of rice was 450 yuan per "shi" (a unit of dry measure) which could buy more than four "shi" of rice. The production standard was five districts of paper per day, not including the bonuses for exceeding the standard (each person could make up to seven districts per day). The wages were higher than any light industry wages in Changzhi City, equal to the first-class wages of heavy industry. However, the City Federation of Trade Unions repeatedly claimed that the paper mill's wages had been reduced, and constantly supported the workers' demands for wage increases, always dissatisfied with the factory.

Last July, the factory felt that the wages were too high and the costs were too large, so it proposed appropriately reducing wages and changing from earning paper to earning rice. However, the workers demanded an extremely unreasonable and excessive "five 'shi' of rice and three 'zhang' of cloth" (a 'zhang' is about 3.3 meters). After several disputes, it was finally decided to pay one 'shi' and eight 'dou' of rice and twenty-five square 'chi' of cloth per month, with food still provided by the factory. In fact, this amount was still higher than general wages. However, both the City Federation of Trade Unions and the workers were dissatisfied. In order to get more bonuses, they deliberately reduced production, lowering the production standard from five districts per day to four and a half districts. By last winter, it had been reduced to four districts, but the actual production was five to six districts.

Due to this reduction in wages and the change from earning paper to earning rice, the Federation of Trade Unions and the workers were extremely dissatisfied with the factory, mainly focusing on Li Fugui (the deputy factory director and accountant sent by the newspaper, who was originally a carpenter). On August 15th, the workers, under the leadership of a few Xiangyuan workers and with the support of the City Federation of Trade Unions, launched the "struggle Li Fugui" incident under the pretext of the shutdown issue (the factory regularly shuts down for one month every two seasons. It was originally proposed by the workers, but after the factory agreed to their proposal and announced the shutdown, the workers denied it, saying that the shutdown was the factory's dismissal of workers without cause). As a result, work was stopped for ten days (but the workers' wages were still paid), and the factory suffered a direct loss of hundreds of thousands of yuan. At that time, the Municipal Committee and the City Federation of Trade Unions stood purely on the side of the workers. Yan Zhen of the Municipal Committee, Sun Guobao, secretary of the Third Branch, Li Yisheng, deputy secretary, Song Youxin, director of the City Federation of Trade Unions, Niu Laiquan, director of the Propaganda Department of the City Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhao Baocheng, director of the Armed Forces Department of the City Federation of Trade Unions, etc., one-sidedly listened to the workers' opinions. Director Zhao Baocheng even said: This is "the paper mill undermining the workers' movement." Under the pressure of the Municipal Committee, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the workers, two struggle meetings were held, the reasons being that Li Fugui's "leadership style was undemocratic," that he dismissed workers without cause (referring to the shutdown issue), deducted workers' wages (referring to the appropriate wage reduction), embezzled, etc. At the meeting, Li Fugui was almost beaten. At the second meeting, the branch secretary, the director of the City Federation of Trade Unions, and the director of the Propaganda Department all personally participated. Before the meeting, Li Yisheng, deputy secretary of the branch committee, and Niu Laiquan, director of the Propaganda Department of the City Federation of Trade Unions, proposed their solution: "Li Fugui must be removed from the factory, otherwise the problem cannot be solved." Director Niu even said directly: "If Li Fugui does not leave the factory, all the workers will quit and disband. If the factory does not accept this opinion, we will not care..." As a result, under the pressure of the Municipal Committee and the City Federation of Trade Unions, the newspaper was forced to announce the dismissal of Comrade Li Fugui, and he received a Party warning (The reason Li Fugui was not beaten was because he was a Party member and the secretary of the paper mill branch. The warning was given by the Municipal Committee because the administrative power of the paper mill was led by the newspaper, but the branch was led by the Municipal Committee, and it has not changed until now).

More than half of the paper mill workers are from Xiangyuan, led by Li Laixiu (engineering), Wu Changhai (factory director), Qiao Gen (director of the Federation of Trade Unions), Jiang Dan (branch secretary), and others, who have formed a solid sectarian group in economic terms, excluding non-Xiangyuan workers, especially apprentices (the wages of apprentices are not high, but the Xiangyuan sect and the City Federation of Trade Unions do not care).

During the paper mill incident, Song Youxin, director of the City Federation of Trade Unions, twice requested the newspaper to hand over the management of the paper mill to the Federation of Trade Unions.

The City Federation of Trade Unions views the paper mill as a "capitalist," treating the paper mill with a "capitalist attitude." Therefore, the solution to the labor-capital relations problem is not to solve the problem through consultation under the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, but to be the tail of the workers' economism, purely economic viewpoint, to mobilize the workers, support the workers, and struggle against the factory. They do not understand that the paper mill is a public enterprise or a revolutionary factory. They moved the set of methods of struggling against feudal landlords in the countryside to the city to deal with industry and commerce and solve labor-capital problems, which is wrong. They even brought the slogan "The landlord is evil, the peasant is truth" into the factory, turning it into "The factory is evil, the worker is truth." Implementing "The tiller has his own land" in the countryside has become "The worker has his own factory" in the factory. The Changzhi Municipal Committee also has the same view as the Federation of Trade Unions.

Because the paper mill workers are controlled by a few old Xiangyuan workers, they have colluded with some cadres of the City Federation of Trade Unions, not only frequently going in and out of restaurants and theaters, but also being able to borrow money from the paper mill at will (Director Song Youxin alone borrowed 300,000 yuan, and Director Niu Laiquan borrowed more than 30,000 yuan), becoming the tail of the workers' economism. After eating with a short mouth, they inevitably lose their principles and cannot adhere to principles. Therefore, in addition to directly supporting the workers, they only say good things about the workers to the Municipal Committee. Since they have eaten sweets, they have to "speak good words to heaven." The Municipal Committee only listens to one side of the story, unconditionally believing the words of the Federation of Trade Unions cadres, and rarely listening to the opinions of the factory. The main reason is that they mistakenly regard the factory as landlords and rich peasants and the workers as poor and hired peasants. For example, Municipal Committee member Yan and Director Song have both said that the paper mill saved 4,500 workers and doubled production when talking about Changzhi's annual production. After the People's Daily published this news on December 29 last year, Reader Zheng Yan and Fu Hong exposed it on February 8.

Due to the low output, high wages, and poor quality of the paper mill, the cost of paper is very high. Now, the price of folk paper and double-printed paper in Lintang and other places is 25,000 to 26,000 yuan per stack (thousand sheets), while the cost of double-printed paper produced by the Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill in March is as high as 37,500 yuan per stack, not including construction costs.

### 长治市错误的工资政策

　　长治市错误的工资政策
    人民日报编辑同志：我们看到人民日报四月十八日对长治市划阶级及工商业的意见，感觉到十分正确。为了纠正长治市在工商业中的错误政策，为了给长治市委提供一个具体材料，特把长市新华纸厂的材料写去。我们希望这个材料能在人民日报上发表。
    对长治新华纸厂存在两种不同认识：我们认为纸厂工人中襄垣小宗派很严重，他们的经济主义很厉害；而长治市工会、工会三分会是培养、支持这种小宗派和经济主义的。市委会则完全听信市工会的假报告。而市工会则认为工人工资低，新华日报馆派去的副厂长栗富贵作风不民主。究竟是怎样呢？下面是事实。
    长治市新华纸厂，其前身原为敌伪创办。长市解放后，归上党建设公司接管。不久移交给太行纸业公司。四六年三月转归新华日报馆接办。当时规模甚小，只有四口抄纸池，一盘土碾，动力为三个牲口，工人连职员共十六七人。四六年秋，市工会提出实行“劳资两利”、“劳资合作”。试行数月结果，厂方每月只盈余二万多元，工具折旧等尚未扣除。而当时工人工资除由厂方管饭外，每月即为两万余元，厂方盈余只顶一个工人的工资。所谓“劳资两利”，实际上是片面的劳利资亏。而这种所谓劳资两利的办法，在四六年太行区群英会上，工会一再鼓吹提倡，选为“模范工厂”，并产生了“英雄”、“模范经理”。当时，某军火工厂负责同志曾这样说：“新华纸厂是轻工业，工资如此之高；象这样子的劳动英雄，我们还多得很！”
    去年春，纸厂扩大生产量，从原有之四口抄纸池，扩充为十口池子，改用畜力为电力，资本增加到千余万元（现在则增到五千万元）。同时发现原经理有贪污腐化行为，即将其撤换，大胆提用厂内工人“劳动英雄”武昌海担任经理。此时工资为十区麻纸（伙食在外），值二万元左右。当时米价为四百五十元一市斗，可买四石多米。生产标准为每日五区纸，超出之数分红尚不在内（每人每日最高可抄七区）。工资之高，超出长市任何轻工业工资，与重工业一等工资相等。但市工会则一再认为纸厂工资降低了，经常支持工人增资意见，处处对厂方不满。
    去年七月，厂方感到工资过高，成本太大，提出适当降低工资，并改赚纸赚米。但工人提出要“五石米、三丈布”的极不合理的过高要求，几经争执，最后决定为每月一石八斗米，二十五方尺布，伙食仍由厂方供给。实际此数比一般工资还是高。但市工会及工人均不满，他们为了多分红，硬将生产量降低，生产标准从每日五区降到四区半。到去年冬天，则减到四区了，但实际生产量则为五区到六区。
    由于这次减低工资及改赚纸为赚米，工会与工人对厂方极为不满，主要集中在栗富贵身上（是报馆派去的副厂长兼会计，木匠工人出身）。八月十五，工人借口停工问题（每年两季照例停工一月。当时本为工人提出，但厂方同意其意见并宣布停工后，工人即加否认，说停工是厂方无故开除工人），在少数襄垣工人带头及在市工会撑腰作主下，爆发纸厂斗争栗富贵事件。结果停工十天（但工人工资仍然发），厂方直接损失数十万元。当时市委、市工会单纯站在工人方面，市委阎镇，三分书记孙国宝，副书记李宜生，市工会主任宋有信，市工会宣传部长牛来全，市工会武装部长赵保成等，片面听信工人意见。赵保成部长并说：这是“纸厂破坏职工运动”。在市委、工会及工人的压力下，共开斗争大会两次，理由是栗富贵“领导作风不民主”，无故开除工人（指停工问题），克扣工人工资（指适当降低工资），贪污等等。在大会上栗几乎被打。第二次会上，分委书记、市工会主任、宣传部长等，均亲自参加。在开会前，分委副书记李宜生、市工会宣传部长牛来全提出他们的解决办法是：“栗富贵一定得撤换离厂，否则问题即不能解决。”牛部长更直接了当的说：“栗富贵如不出厂，则全体工人都不干要散伙。如厂方不接受此意见，我们即不管了………”。结果在市委、市工会压力下，报馆被迫将栗富贵同志宣布撤职，并受到党内的警告处分（栗富贵没有挨打的原因，是由于栗是党员，且是纸厂支书。受到警告处分是市委的处分，因纸厂行政权归报馆领导，但支部归市委领导，至今未变）。
    纸厂工人中半数以上为襄垣人，以李来秀（工务）、武昌海（厂长）、乔根（工会主任）、姜旦（支书）等数人为首，在经济上结成巩固的小宗派，排斥非襄垣工人，特别是对非襄垣的学徒排斥与统治更为厉害（学徒的工资是不高的，但襄垣小宗派和市工会是不关心的）。
    在纸厂事件中，市工会主任宋有信，曾两次提出要求报社将纸厂交给工会管理。
    市工会对纸厂的看法，认为厂方是“资本家”，以“对资本家的态度”对纸厂。故对劳资关系问题的解决，不是在发展生产、劳资两利的原则下，用协商方式来解决问题，而是做工人经济主义的尾巴，单纯经济观点，发动工人给工人撑腰，向厂方斗争。不了解纸厂是公营事业或革命工厂，把农村中斗争封建地主的一套办法，都原封不动的搬到城市来对待工商业，来解决劳资问题，这是错误的。甚至把“地主即是罪恶，农民即是真理”的口号也搬进工厂，变成“厂方即是罪恶，工人即是真理”。在农村实行“耕者有其田”，在工厂即成为“工者有其厂”。长市市委也与工会有同样的观点。
    由于纸厂工人掌握在几个襄垣老工人手中，他们便拉拢了市工会一部干部，不仅经常进出饭馆、戏院，而且可以在纸厂随便借钱（宋主任有信一人借了三十万，牛部长来全借了三万多），做工人的经济主义尾巴。他们在吃了嘴短之后，腰即不硬了，即不能坚持原则了，这是必然的。所以除直接给工人撑腰外，到市委那里便只说工人对。既然吃了糖，便只得“上天言好事”了。而市委只听一面之词，无条件的相信工会干部的话，很少听取厂方意见。主要原因，是他们错误的把厂方看成地主富农，工人看成贫雇。如阎市委、宋主任在先后谈到长治市一年生产时，都曾说纸厂省工四千五百个，增产一倍。去年十二月二十九日人民日报登载这个消息后，二月八日读者正言、傅宏予以揭发。
    由于纸厂的产量低，工资高，质量坏，所以纸的成本很大。现在林汤等地民间纸，双印纸每块（千张）售价二万五六千元，而长市新华纸厂三月份出的双印纸，每块成本则达三万七千五百元，而建设费尚未列入。
