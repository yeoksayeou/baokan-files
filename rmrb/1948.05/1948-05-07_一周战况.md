Weekly Battle Situation
April 29th to May 5th

Following the capture of Weixian city, a strategic point in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, on April 27th, the East China People's Liberation Army (PLA) successively captured Anqiu, Changle, and Hanting Town on the 30th and 1st of May, annihilating all or most of the defending enemy. In the battle to capture Weixian, we annihilated more than 25,000 enemy troops of the 96th Army of Chiang Kai-shek and puppet bandits, capturing over 18,000 alive. Chen Jincheng, the bandit Lieutenant General and Commander of the 45th Division of the 96th Army, whom Shandong enemy chieftain Wang Yaowu called "highly meritorious in a hundred battles," was finally captured. By this point, the Chiang bandits in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway had been completely eliminated by our forces. Under the powerful offensive of our East China PLA, Chiang's troops rose up in rebellion. On April 9th, 170 officers and soldiers of the Zhucheng Security Brigade garrisoned south of Changle, defected to our army under the leadership of the Deputy Brigade Commander Zhao Chengxian. On the 28th, the entire two detachments and thirteen companies, totaling 1,500 men, of the puppet Weixian "People's Self-Defense Force," revolted south of Changle under the leadership of Deputy Commander Fan Qi＠.

The Central China and Lunan local armed forces launched extensive attacks to protect the spring plowing, also achieving victories. In Central China, 1,700 enemy troops were annihilated in Jingjiang, Nantong, and Huaibei in Southern Jiangsu within half a month. In Lunan, they pressed towards the Jinpu and Linzao lines, recovering vast villages in Sishui, Feixian, and Guanyang, annihilating over 1,400 enemy troops.

On April 23rd, the Jireliao PLA recaptured Duolun City, a strategic town in northern Chahar Province, in one fell swoop. Two regiments of Fu Zuoyi's 10th and 11th Security Regiments and a cavalry unit, totaling 2,100 men, were annihilated. Jing Yingqing, the puppet Chahar Provincial Security 4th Column Commander and City Defense Commander, and 640 others were killed, and 1,500 enemy troops, including Liu Tiefu, the Zhaowu Commissioner and "Save the People Pioneer Team" Captain, with the rank of Colonel, were captured alive. On the same day, local armed forces captured Shuining, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits in eastern Chahar, annihilating over 500 enemy troops. The Jidong local armed forces, active along the Beining Railway, also annihilated over 400 enemy troops north of Tangshan. A company of 110 men from the 53rd Army of Chiang Kai-shek stationed in Xintai, Tieling, defected to our side with their weapons on April 23rd.

A unit of the PLA in the Pingjinbao area advanced into the suburbs of Beiping and launched extensive attacks north of the Daqing River, subjecting the vulnerable heartland of Fu Zuoyi's bandits to continuous strikes. On April 18th, we captured Bei'anhe Gaolizhuang, located more than 30 li from Beiping, and simultaneously captured several villages such as Zhangfang and Wayao between Wanping and Changping. North of the Daqing River, our local armed forces also achieved successive victories. In late April, they cleared three enemy strongholds and large township police teams in the outer areas of Baxian, Yongqing, Gu'an, and Shengfang, annihilating a total of 700 bandits under Battalion Commander Wang Fenggang.

After recovering Yan'an and liberating Luochuan, the Northwest PLA pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy troops in both locations. From the 23rd to the 25th, they annihilated over 700 enemy troops. On the 27th, they completely defeated the 12th, 48th, and 61st Brigades in Wuzhuang on the Luo(chuan)-Bai(shui) highway, and completely annihilated one regiment and one battalion of the 61st Brigade, capturing over 1,600 alive.

The Yu-Shaanxi-E PLA recaptured Runan on the 1st. The local Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled in disarray. The local armed forces in the area are growing stronger. The local armed forces of the Third Sub-district entered the area north of the Luo River, annihilating over 1,700 bandits in 26 days, capturing Luoning County and several important strongholds, expanding the area north of the Luo River.

The local armed forces and militia of the Taiyue Fifth Sub-district of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region also searched and suppressed over 600 fleeing and dispersed bandits and local Chiang Kai-shek troops west of Mengjin from April 19th to 21st. Most of the area is now under our control.
