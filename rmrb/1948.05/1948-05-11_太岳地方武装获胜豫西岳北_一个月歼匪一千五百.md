    Taiyue Local Armed Forces Win in Western Henan and Northern Yue
    Annihilating 1,500 Bandits in One Month
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] The Taiyue Military Region's local armed forces achieved great victories in suppressing bandits in western Henan in April, having largely eliminated the local Chiang Kai-shek forces in Xin'an and Mengjin counties. They also pressed towards Shanzhou, connecting the Taiyue area in the west of Mengjin, Xin'an, and Mianchi with the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei area, allowing for unobstructed passage. In this month, in the western Henan and northern Yue areas, our local armed forces annihilated a total of more than 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, including 388 killed or wounded, including Gao Guansan, the Chief Commander of the "clearing and suppression" of the puppet Xin'an, Mianchi, and Yiyang counties. 1,071 bandits were captured alive, including Guan Jiwu, the deputy commander of the 53rd Brigade of the local Chiang Kai-shek forces, and regimental commanders Wei Qinglong and Guo Wenzong. 48 surrendered to us. The captured materials include 2 mortars, 1 small cannon, 15 light machine guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 1,555 rifles and carbines, 52 pistols, more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and many other military supplies. More than 200,000 people in Luoyang and Mengjin were liberated.
