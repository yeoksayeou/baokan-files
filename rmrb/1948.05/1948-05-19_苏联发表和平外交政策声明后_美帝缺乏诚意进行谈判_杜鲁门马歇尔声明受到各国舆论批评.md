Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. According to TASS, Moscow, the "Pravda" observer Viktorov wrote an article on the 14th analyzing the comments from various parties on the U.S.-Soviet statements. Viktorov wrote: The exchange of notes between the U.S. and Soviet governments on May 4th and 9th received great concern and attention from the world. A Reuters reporter wrote: London breathed a great sigh of relief upon learning that the Soviet Union had accepted the U.S. proposal to hold negotiations on the differences between the two countries. The French newspaper "Le Monde" hailed the prospects of U.S.-Soviet negotiations, writing: The U.S. State Department has expressed its willingness to begin frank talks with the Soviet Union in order to alleviate the anxiety of the American people and eliminate the war mania whose poison is likely to spread widely. The American public had a warm and clearly satisfied reaction to the news that the Soviet Union had agreed to negotiate with the United States. The New York Times published this news with the large headline: Soviet Union Accepts U.S. Proposal to Negotiate Differences. The New York Herald Tribune reported to its readers: The Soviet Union is prepared to negotiate to end the discord with the United States. Even social figures known for their anti-Soviet rhetoric, such as Senator Connally and House Speaker Martin, felt it necessary to welcome the start of U.S.-Soviet negotiations, given the mood of the general public. Therefore, it seemed that everything favored an early start to concretely realize the desire expressed by the U.S. government and endorsed by the Soviet government.

　　However, the U.S. policymakers then came out with statements that once again showed how different the statements of some political leaders are from their true intentions. U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall declared that U.S. policy remains unchanged. Marshall also said that the U.S. government has no intention of conducting bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union involving the interests of other governments. At the same time, a series of receptions were held for American journalists in the secret rooms of Washington, after which, as if by magic, the tone of American newspapers changed dramatically and began to cool down. The tone of the American political leaders also changed accordingly. House Republican Leader Halleck found himself in an embarrassing situation. He stated the day before that an understanding that would satisfy both countries would be appropriate; on May 12th, he admitted feeling rather confused and hoped the government would clarify the situation.

　　How to explain this situation that embarrassed Washington so much that the Republican leader of the House called it confusion? A Washington reporter for a telegraphic news agency said: American progressives believe: "The State Department was surprised by the Soviet Union's rapid and unexpected response. Some government officials were convinced that the Soviet Union would either refuse or shelve Ambassador Smith's statement." The telegraphic news agency reporter further wrote: "Now, the State Department seems to want to lower the hopes for negotiations."

　　American newspapers do not conceal the fact that the war mania stirred up in the United States as a result of a long and stubborn propaganda campaign launched by reactionaries has reached a point where it is difficult for the American ruling clique to deal with. Therefore, this requires them to take urgent measures to alleviate the anxiety of the American people. The American people did temporarily alleviate their anxiety when they learned of the exchange of statements between Ambassador Smith and Foreign Minister Molotov. However, after the U.S. policymakers began to back down, this feeling of relief began to dissipate just as quickly.

　　This new shift in American policy has even drawn criticism in conservative American newspapers. The Washington Post wrote: The government is losing the opportunity to consider the issues raised by the Soviet government, and there is nothing to justify its lack of effort to resolve the issues through negotiation. Even the New York Herald Tribune, after it had already turned around and stubbornly tried to pour cold water on the enthusiasm of its readers, now says: The White House and the State Department have not responded with sufficient sincerity to the Soviet Union's acceptance of the U.S. proposal.

　　In this regard, it is worth pointing out the statement of Wallace, the representative of the progressive people of America. Wallace felt it necessary to publish his own open letter to Premier Stalin those days, in which he put forward a program of action aimed at restoring cooperation between the two great powers. This statement reflected the urgency of the issues raised in the process of the exchange of statements between the U.S. and Soviet governments.

　　When the news of the exchange of statements between the U.S. and Soviet governments was first released, it received a positive response from newspapers in countries such as Britain and France. This proves the hypocrisy of the warmongering sentiment recently stirred up by most bourgeois newspapers in European countries. What is particularly clear in this regard is Bevin's statement, this time he could not hide his hostility to the prospect of improved U.S.-Soviet relations. On the other hand, even Reuters said that London's feeling about Marshall's rejection of the possibility of bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union was one of disappointment.

　　In the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union's peaceful policy has been fully understood; the U.S. government's proposal has received due attention here, and the statements subsequently made by American politicians have also aroused due criticism.

　　In the Soviet Union, needless to say, the exchange of statements between the U.S. and Soviet governments received warm attention. This also reflects the deep confidence of the broad masses of the Soviet people in the correct foreign policy of the Soviet government.

　　苏联发表和平外交政策声明后
  　美帝缺乏诚意进行谈判
    杜鲁门马歇尔声明受到各国舆论批评
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科电，真理报观察家维克托洛夫十四日著文分析各方对美苏声明的评论。维氏写道：美苏政府于五月四日和九日交换照会，获得全世界的极大关心与注意。路透社记者写道：伦敦获悉苏联接受了美国关于举行两国分歧的谈判的建议时，大大松了一口气。法国“世界”报为美苏谈判的前途欢呼，它写道：美国务院表示愿与苏联开始坦白的会谈，以便减轻美国人民的焦虑，消除其毒素有广泛蔓延之虞的战争狂。美国社会公众对苏联同意与美国谈判的消息，有热烈而且显然满意的反应，纽约时报发表这一消息时用这样的大标题：苏接受美建议谈判解决分歧。纽约先驱论坛报告诉它的读者说：苏联准备进行谈判以终止与美国的不和。甚至以反苏言论著称的社会人士，如参议员康纳利和众院议长马丁之流，鉴于广大社会公众的情绪，也认为有欢迎苏美开始谈判的必要。因此，似乎每件事情都有利于尽早开始具体实现美国政府所表示且获得苏联政府赞同的愿望。
    但是，美国的决策者们这时却出而发表一些声明，这些声明又一次表示某些政治领袖的声明是与他们真正的意图如何不同。美总统杜鲁门和国务卿马歇尔宣称，美国政策仍然不变。马歇尔还说，美政府毫无与苏联进行牵涉他国政府利益的双边谈判的意图。同时，在华盛顿的密室里为美国记者举行了一连串的招待会，会后竟好象变戏法一样，美国报纸的语调剧烈改变，并开始冷淡下来。美国政治领袖们的语调也相应改变。众院共和党领袖哈利克发觉自己也陷入了狼狈的境地，他前一天声明说，可以使两国满意的谅解是很合宜的；五月十二日他承认感到相当的混乱，并希望政府澄清这种局势。
    对于使华盛顿这样狼狈而为众院共和党领袖称为混乱的局势，如何解释呢？电报通讯社华盛顿记者说：美进步人士认为：“国务院对于苏联迅速而意外的答复感到突然。某些政府人士曾经确信，苏联不是拒绝就会是搁置史密斯大使的声明”。电报通讯社记者更写道：“现在，国务院似乎想要抑低谈判的希望。”
    美国报纸并不掩盖下述事实：由于反动派发动的长期而顽固的宣传运动的结果，在美国引起的战争狂，业已到达了使美国统治集团很难对付的程度。因此，这就需要他们采取紧急措施以减轻美国人民的焦虑。美国人民当获悉史密斯大使和莫洛托夫外长互换声明时，的确暂时减轻了焦虑。但是，在美国决策者们开始打退堂鼓以后，这种松一口气的感觉就同样快地开始消散。
    美国政策中这种新的转变甚至在美国保守的报纸上也引起了批评。华盛顿邮报写道：政府正失去考虑苏政府所提的问题的机会，并且没有东西可作为口实，用以辩解它缺乏以谈判解决问题的努力。甚至纽约先驱论坛报，在它已经向后转并顽固地企图给读者的热情泼冷水以后，现在也说：白宫和国务院对于苏联之接受美国建议，并没有足够诚恳的反应。
    在这方面值得指出的是美国进步人民的代表华莱士的声明。华莱士认为有必要在那几天发表他自己给斯大林总理的公开信，他在信中提出以恢复两大国之间的合作为目的的行动纲领。这一声明反映了在苏美政府交换声明的过程中所提出的问题的迫切性。
    美苏政府交换声明的消息刚一发出时，曾受到英法等国报纸的积极反应。这可以证明在欧洲各国近来由大多数资产阶级报纸所煽起的好战情绪的虚伪性。在这一方面衬托得特别清楚的是贝文的声明，这一次他又不能掩盖他对苏美关系改善的前途所怀的敌意。另一方面，甚至路透社，在马歇尔拒绝了与苏联进行双边谈判的可能性以后，也说伦敦对这一声明的感觉是沮丧的。
    在东欧人民民主国家里，对苏联的和平政策已有充分了解；美政府的提议在这里获得适当的注意，而美国政客随后所发表的声明，也引起了适当的批评。
    在苏联，用不着说，美苏政府交换声明受到热烈关切。这也反映了苏联广大人民对苏政府的正确外交政策具有深厚的信心。
