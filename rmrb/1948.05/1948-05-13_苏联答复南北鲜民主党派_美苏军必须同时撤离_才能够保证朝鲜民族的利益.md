Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 11th: TASS, Pyongyang, May 7th reports: Lieutenant General Korotkov, Commander of the Soviet Army in North Korea, handed the Soviet government's reply to the Joint Conference of Democratic Parties and Groups in North and South Korea to the chairman of the conference, Kim Tu-bong, on the 7th. The reply stated: "The Soviet government has received a letter from the Joint Conference of Democratic Parties and Groups in North and South Korea to the Soviet and American governments, requesting that the two countries immediately withdraw their troops from Korea so that the Korean people can freely hold general elections without foreign interference, in order to form a national democratic government and establish an independent and unified country. The Soviet government fully understands and sympathizes with the wishes of the Korean people. To this end, the Soviet delegation opposed attempts to resolve the Korean issue without the participation of Korean people's representatives and without considering the interests of the Korean nation at the Second United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet government insists that the simultaneous withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea is a prerequisite for ensuring that the Korean people express their free will. As early as September 1947, the Soviet delegation made this proposal in the Soviet-American Joint Commission and proposed that the withdrawal date be the beginning of 1948. This proposal was reiterated by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1947, but it was not accepted. The Soviet government, as in the past, is prepared to withdraw its troops from Korea immediately, but only on the condition that U.S. troops withdraw from Korea simultaneously."
   
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 11th: Moscow News Agency international observer wrote an article on the 6th criticizing the American reactionary leader Vandenberg's fallacies such as "how the United States government 'helps' the Korean people in South Korea to exercise their legitimate rights to independently handle their destiny." The observer pointed out: The living facts of Korea so strongly and convincingly refuted Vandenberg. Hodge, commander of the US garrison in South Korea, decided to hold a split election on May 10 and hand over the "supervisory power" of the election to the so-called United Nations Korean Commission established in violation of the United Nations Charter. However, the Korean people resolutely oppose the US policy of splitting Korea, and even Menon, chairman of the committee, admitted that the only people who advocate the establishment of a split government in South Korea are the reactionary Syngman Rhee and the so-called "Democratic Party" representing the interests of Korean landlords under his control. The observer pointed out: The decision to hold a split election in South Korea proves that the US authorities have disregarded the will of the Korean people. Vandenberg's so-called "helping" the Korean people "independently handle their destiny" is just like this. The observer concluded: The Korean people have fully seen what is democracy and what is reaction, and the Pyongyang Conference illustrates this point.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 11th: Tokyo News: Approximately three thousand Korean residents in Fukuoka held another meeting on the 6th and passed a resolution requesting the Japanese authorities to implement the Potsdam Declaration, allowing the Korean residents to have educational autonomy, and opposing national discrimination and oppression against Korean residents. A demonstration was held after the meeting.

    苏联答复南北鲜民主党派
    美苏军必须同时撤离
    才能够保证朝鲜民族的利益
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据塔斯社平壤七日讯：北鲜苏军司令科罗特科夫中将，于七日将苏联政府致南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议之复文，交予该会主席金托本。该复文称：“苏联政府接获南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议致苏美政府书，该书要求两国立即自朝鲜撤军，使朝鲜人民能不受外国干涉，自由举行大选；以便组成全国民主政府，并建立独立统一的国家。苏联政府十分了解并同情朝鲜人民的意愿。为此，苏代表团早在联合国第二届大会上即反对没有朝鲜人民代表参加及不考虑朝鲜民族利益而解决朝鲜问题的企图。苏联政府坚持必须美苏军队同时撤离朝鲜，认为这是保证朝鲜人民表现其自由意志的首要条件。早在一九四七年九月间，苏代表团曾在苏美联合委员会提出这种建议，并提议以一九四八年初为撤军日期。这一建议曾由苏代表团在一九四七年十月的联合国大会上再度提出过，然未被接受。苏联政府如过去一样，准备立即自朝鲜撤退其军队，但须以美军同时撤离朝鲜为条件。”
    【新华社陕北十一日电】莫斯科讯：消息报国际观察家六日著文抨击美反动头子范登堡所谓“美国政府在南鲜如何‘帮助’鲜明人民执行其合法权利，以独立的处理其命运”等谬论。观察家指出：朝鲜的活的事实，是如此强烈而具有说服性地驳倒了范登堡。南鲜美驻军司令霍奇决定于五月十日举行分裂选举，并把选举的“监督权”交给违反联合国宪章而建立的所谓联合国朝鲜委员会。但朝鲜人民坚决反对美国分裂朝鲜的政策，甚至该委员会主席梅农亦承认：唯一主张在南鲜建立分裂政府的人，只有反动派李承晚和在他控制下代表朝鲜地主利益的所谓“民主党”。观察家指出：南鲜分裂选举的决定，证明美国当局把朝鲜人民的意志置若罔闻。范登堡所谓“帮助”朝鲜人民“独立的处理其命运”就是如此。观察家结语称：朝鲜人民完全看清了什么是民主什么是反动，平壤会议就说明了这一点。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】东京讯：福冈约三千名鲜侨的六日再度集会并通过决议，要求日本当局实行波茨顿宣言，允许鲜侨教育自主的决议，反对鲜侨的民族歧视和压迫。会后并举行示威游行。
