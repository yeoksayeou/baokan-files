　　Several Problems in Production in Shili Village
　　Huan Shan
　　Since the work team left Shili Village, I have learned from conversations with village cadres and the masses that the following problems exist in production:
　　(1) The village branch and village government lack leadership in production work. The branch secretary emphasizes that "there is no way to lead, and the party members' morale is not high"; the production director emphasizes that "my ability is weak," and says that the groups have not yet reported. Although the women's textile group has been organized, and the cooperative has decided to provide loans to support textiles, no one is interested in the cooperative's two hundred jin of cotton, and it cannot be lent out. This may be an unavoidable phenomenon in the short term after party rectification, but it is also due to the work team leaving too hastily, and the new leaders are not yet familiar. Therefore, the first thing to do now is to establish the normal leadership of the branch, and lead production in a planned and organized manner. How party members can play a backbone and leading role in each group, and how to specifically help new cadres lead the work, are all practical problems that must be resolved quickly.
　　(2) The staff of the cooperative are not at ease in their work. From July to December last year, they earned more than 2.6 million yuan. The cooperative staff received 20% of the profits, only 52,000 yuan, plus the 30,000 yuan from the first half of the year, totaling 82,000 yuan. Manager Wang Xingshun said: "Household expenses and fuel cost 10,000 yuan a month; I have three children, no labor, and my wife is partially disabled, there is no way." Cook Wang Peijin is a poor peasant and is also unwilling to work. He said, "I was forced to come in. They said I have two brothers, and if I don't do it, they will call me to join the army!" He also said, "If I go to the kiln to work, I'm a master craftsman, and I can earn more than 200,000 in two months." "I'm still in debt. My father didn't leave me anything, I don't even have a hair (animal hair)." Li Cheng, who was in charge of accounting last year, said: "In the past, even if you broke the harness, no one would say it was good. I heard that the Guzhen cooperative has a 40/60 profit sharing, but here it's still 20/80." The oil mill also has the same situation. Therefore, I think the cooperative must pay attention to:
　　1. Adopt a policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, establish a fixed wage and profit-sharing system, with clear rewards and punishments. Good deeds should be rewarded, bad deeds should be criticized. One should not unilaterally emphasize taking care of the interests of the masses and ignore the interests of the cooperative staff. Their family farming problems must be properly handled so that they can concentrate on business.
　　2. In terms of organizational issues, it has also been affected by the one-sided view of poor and hired peasants. Former oil mill manager Li Baowu said: "I can't lead them (referring to the master craftsmen), their composition is good, and they speak firmly." And the master craftsmen complained about Li Baowu: "You don't see us working, you're either looking at the new public or holding the child." It is necessary for the manager not to put on airs, but the workers should not demand equality, but should divide the work and cooperate, each fulfilling their responsibilities, with democratic centralism. Undemocratic and extremely democratic practices in cooperatives are both harmful.
　　3. The staff of the cooperative should not be replaced frequently. If there are mistakes, they should be criticized and asked to correct them; if they cannot make money, the reasons should be investigated, and simply replacing personnel is not a solution. This will prevent the cooperative's work from accumulating experience, and the newly elected cadres are also prone to not making long-term plans and simply dealing with things temporarily. For example, the new oil mill manager Fu Zhi said: "They couldn't do it, can I? I think Li Baowu was not bad, without capital, he still made 500,000 to 600,000 last year!"
　　The fact that the cooperative's 200 jin of cotton cannot be lent out indicates that there are problems in the textile work. In addition to leadership inspections, there are also practical reasons: last year, one jin of cloth could be exchanged for three and a half jin of cotton, but this year no one specifically collects and exchanges even two jin. One jin of cotton costs 1,100 yuan, one jin of cloth costs 2,200 yuan, and it costs 120 yuan to fluff one jin of cotton, and it also loses more than one tael. It costs 1,000 yuan to find someone to spin one jin of cotton. Li Cheng said: "There is no profit, and the women won't do it!" Production Director Zhang Zheng said: "In the past, even in famine years, 6,000 jin of cotton were lent out. Our Shili Village's textiles were a model in the ninth district, but the woven cloth cannot be sold, there is no way." Therefore, economic agencies should pay attention to the regulation and export of homespun cloth, and import other necessities.
　　The above problems are just some feelings, and may not be correct, but I estimate that they may also be common problems, so I write them out for reference.

### 什里店生产中几个问题

　　什里店生产中几个问题
    幻山
    自工作组离开什里店后，我从村干及群众的谈话中，发现生产中存在着以下几个问题：
    （一）村支部及村政权对生产工作缺乏领导，支部书记强调“没法领导，党员情绪不高”；生产主任强调“自己能力弱”，说各组还没报告。妇女纺织小组虽然组织起来了，合作社决定贷花扶植纺织，但合作社的二百斤棉花无人问津，贷不出去。这可能是在整党后短期内不可避免的现象，但也由于工作组走的太仓促，新的领导还不够熟悉。因此目前第一件事情，应该是建立支部的正常领导，有计划有组织地领导生产。党员在各小组中如何起骨干与带头作用，以及如何具体地帮助新干部领导工作，都是现实问题，必须迅速解决。
    （二）合作社人员工作不安心。从去年七月到十二月，赚了二百六十多万元，合作社人员按二八分红，只分到五万二千元，连前半年的三万元，共八万二千元。经理王兴顺说：“家里一个月支差和烧的，得花一万元；有三个孩子，没劳力，老婆是个半残废，没有办法。”火夫王培金是个贫农，也不愿干，他说：“咱是被迫进来的，人家说咱有弟兄两个，不干就叫去参军！”又说：“咱到窑上动弹，咱是个全把式，两个月能嫌二十几万。”“咱到如今还是个窟窿户，老子没给咱留下啥，咱连根毛（牲口毛）也没有。”去年管帐的李成说：“过去你就拉断套也没人说好，听说固镇合作社是四六分红，这里还是二八。”油坊也存在着同样情形。因此我以为合作社必需注意：
    １、采取劳资两利的方针，确立固定的工资与分红制度，赏罚严明，好的奖励，坏的批评，不应当片面的强调照顾群众利益，而忽视合作社人员的利益。他们的家庭种地问题必须适当处理，使其专心营业。
    ２、在组织问题上，也受了片面贫雇观点的影响。前油坊经理李保五说：“咱领导不了人家（指大匠二匠），人家成份好，说话硬。”而大匠二匠则埋怨李保五：“你看不见我们做活，你不是看新大众，就是抱孩子。”经理不要摆架子是必要的，但工人们也不能平均要求，应该分工合作，各尽职责，民主集中。合作社中的不民主和极端民主，都是有害的。
    ３、合作社人员尽可能不要经常更换，有错误应该批评，要他纠正；赚不了钱要考察原因，单纯更换人员不是办法。这样会使合作社工作积累不下经验，新选的干部也容易不作长期打算，临时支应。如油坊新经理傅治说：“人家不行，咱行？我觉得李保五还不错，没本钱，去年还赚了五六十万呢！”
    合作社二百斤棉花贷不出去，说明纺织工作中存在着问题。除领导上应作检查外，另外还有实际情况：去年一斤布能换三斤半棉花，今年二斤也没人专门收换。一斤棉花一千一百元，一斤布二千二百元，弹一斤花一百二十元，还要脱一两多。寻人纺一斤花就得出一千元。李成说：“无利可图，妇女就不干了！”生产主任张正说：“过去灾荒年还贷出六千斤棉花，俺什里店纺织，在九区还是模范，但织成布销不出去，没办法。”因此经济机关应注意土布的调剂与输出，换取其他必需品入口。
    以上问题，仅是些感觉，不见得对，但我估计也可能是带有普遍性的问题，特写出供参考。
