Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- According to news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled area, in Xi'an City, one of the Chiang bandit's counter-revolutionary strongholds, an anti-oppression student movement has broken out. Students from Northwest Institute of Technology and Northwest University have successively gone on strike to protest the Chiang bandit's atrocities of arresting people. On the 7th of this month, two students from the main campus of Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang, Xu Aiyun and Yao Qianchong, were forcibly arrested by soldiers from the 3rd Company of a certain troop-recruiting brigade of Chiang bandit's army passing through Xianyang Railway Station. Xu and Yao presented their student IDs and demanded release, but to no avail. The two were immediately forced into a "conscript train" and beaten, resulting in injuries. Upon receiving the news, students from the institute rushed to the railway station and sent representatives to negotiate with the Chiang bandit army, but with no result. As more and more students gathered, the Chiang bandit company commander even ordered the shooting to begin. It was not until 9:00 PM that night that Xu and Yao were released. After the atrocity occurred, the institute immediately decided to hold a general strike starting from the 8th to express protest, and sent representatives to the Chiang bandit provincial government to demand guarantees for student safety. After the six representatives from Northwest Institute of Technology arrived in Xi'an, the Student Union of Northwest University immediately held an emergency meeting, deciding to hold a general strike starting from the 9th in support of protesting the "Xianyang Railway Station Incident," and to send representatives to visit the injured students. The strike at the two universities lasted for five days. It was not until the Chiang bandit authorities, under the pressure of the student masses, were forced to punish the military officer that the students at the two universities resumed classes on the 13th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- Shanghai dispatch: Students at Jiaotong University here have launched a general strike for two days starting from the 28th to protest the "unreasonable loan system" implemented by the Chiang party school authorities, and to show support for the anti-oppression strike by students at Fudan University.

  　上海交大学生罢课两天
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据蒋区报纸消息，在蒋匪反革命堡垒之一的西安市，亦已爆发反压迫学潮，西北工学院、西北大学两校学生相继罢课，抗议蒋匪抓人暴行。本月七日，咸阳西北工学院总院许蔼云、姚谦冲两学生行至咸阳车站，突被过境蒋匪军某旅接兵第三连士兵强行拉捕；许、姚两生拿出学生证，要求释放无效，二人随即被押入“壮丁车”内，并被拷打致伤。该院学生得讯，纷纷奔向车站，推派代表与蒋匪军交涉，亦无结果。当时学生越聚越多，但该蒋匪连长竟下令开枪，直至当夜九时，许姚两生始获释放。暴行发生后，该院立即决定自八日起举行总罢课表示抗议，并推派代表赴蒋匪省政府要求保障学生安全。西工六代表抵西安后，西北大学学生自治会当即召开紧急会议，决定为抗议“咸阳车站案”自九日起总罢课以为声援，并推派代表慰问受伤同学。两校罢课延续五天，直至蒋匪当局在学生群众压力下被迫将该军官惩办后，两校学生始于十三日复课。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】沪讯：此间交通大学学生自二十八日起举行总罢课两天，抗议蒋党校方当局所实行的“不合理的贷金制度”，并借以声援复旦大学学生的反压迫罢课。
