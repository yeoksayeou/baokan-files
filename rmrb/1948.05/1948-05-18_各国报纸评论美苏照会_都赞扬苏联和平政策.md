Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Following the publication of the US-Soviet notes, newspapers in various countries have published articles praising the Soviet government's peace policy, powerfully reflecting the peace aspirations of the people of all countries. The Prague newspaper *Právo lidu* wrote: The exchange of notes is the result of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peace policy. The Czech newspaper *Rudé právo* said: The Soviet Union has explained the true reasons for the current international situation. Newspapers in the Hungarian capital emphasized the great significance of this event. *Szabad Nép* emphasized that the note illustrates the principle of peace and equality in the Soviet Union's foreign policy toward the people's democratic countries. When Wallace delivered a speech at a mass meeting of 20,000 people in Madison Square, New York, on the 11th, he said: "The whole world is encouraged by the announcement of the US-Soviet notes." Even the editor of the conservative *Christian Science Monitor*, Kenham, declared in a radio speech: The whole world is asking to begin negotiations to resolve US-Soviet differences. Radio commentator Walsh said: Truman's statement on the 11th that American policy remains unchanged is deeply disappointing. Commentator Thomas affirmed: This move by the Soviet Union has embarrassed the State Department. An editorial in the British *Daily Express* wrote: "The uncertain development of the international situation has confused and disappointed the general public. Everyone was relieved to learn that Molotov was prepared to negotiate with the United States. But Marshall's recent statement has caused great concern in addition to optimism." The newspaper emphasized the necessity of US-Soviet negotiations, "because the current stalemate cannot continue." The Canadian capital's *Ottawa Citizen* believes that the Soviet statement "is a friendly and well-intentioned suggestion." The Swedish *Nydag* commented: "US-Soviet negotiations will help world peace," and "the improvement of relations between the two countries will have a significant impact on Sweden." The *Berliner Zeitung* asserted: "If future American policy is based on cooperation with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, then the world can embrace new hope."

　　各国报纸评论美苏照会
  　都赞扬苏联和平政策
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方讯：美苏照会发表后，各国报纸纷纷著论赞扬苏联政府的和平政策，有力地反映了各国人民的和平愿望。捷京布拉窝。里都报写道：交换照会是苏联一贯执行和平政策的结果；捷克真理报说：苏联说明了造成目前国际局势的真正原因。匈牙利首都各报强调这一事件的重大意义；萨巴德·涅普报着重指出：照会说明苏联对各人民民主国家的外交政策的和平平等原则。华莱士十一日在纽约麦迪逊广场的二万人群众大会上发表演说时称：“全世界都为美苏照会的宣布而鼓舞。”甚至保守的美科学箴言报主编肯汉姆在广播演说中宣称：全世界都要求开始解决美苏分歧的谈判。广播评论员华尔施说：杜鲁门十一日声明美国政策仍旧不变，使人深为失望。评论员汤玛斯肯定：苏联这一着使国务院狼狈不堪。英每日快报社论写道：“国际局势发展不定，使一般人民困惑失望。大家得悉莫洛托夫准备与美国谈判，这才松了一口气。但马歇尔最近的声明，又令人在乐观之余，大为忧虑。”该报强调美苏谈判的必要性，“因为目前的僵局不容继续”。加拿大首都公民报认为苏联的声明“是友谊与善意的建议。”瑞典尼达格报评道：“美苏的谈判将有助于世界的和平”，“两国关系的改进将对瑞典有重大影响。”柏林新闻报断言：“如果日后美国的政策，以与苏联及其他民主国家合作为基础，那么世界将可怀抱新希望。”
