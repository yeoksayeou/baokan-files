Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th Dispatch: The great victories of the East China People's Liberation Army sweeping the Jiaoji Railway and liberating Weixian and Changle have caused unprecedented shock in Qingdao, under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Prices in the city have soared wildly. The Qingdao Evening News wrote: "The fate of Shandong is coming to an end. After the counties were recaptured, they were abandoned one after another, either because they 'lost military value' or due to 'strategic transfers'. There are very few complete counties left in Shandong. It is so sad to think about it." The Min Yan Bao complained in an editorial about Chiang Kai-shek's transfer of Fan Hanjie's troops to reinforce Liaoxi, saying: "We have not seen the expansion of the battle results after reinforcing Liaoxi, but as generally expected, Shandong immediately showed instability. Although the position of Liaoxi is not lower than Shandong, ten Liaoxis cannot be exchanged for Weihaiwei, Longkou, and Shijiusuo, not to mention the losses of the withdrawal from Weixian." Due to military defeat, the price of gold notes in Qingdao City has now exceeded that of Shanghai and Beijing, and prices have soared. According to Qingdao newspapers, the black market price of gold exceeds that of Shanghai and Beijing by more than 10 million yuan, and the price of US dollars is higher than that of Shanghai and Beijing by hundreds of thousands of yuan (Chiang currency, same below). From April 30 to May 13, Shuanglong fine cloth increased from 4.44 million to 6.84 million per bolt. Military and merchant ship brand flour increased from 2.8 million to 3.65 million per bag. The Qingdao government authorities have been pushing the responsibility for rising prices onto merchants, and police and military police are arresting merchants everywhere, but prices continue to rise.

　　山东蒋匪大势全非昔比青岛敌极恐慌物价狂涨
    【新华社华东二十五电】华东人民解放军横扫胶济线解放潍县、昌乐的大捷，引起了蒋匪统治下的青岛历来罕见的震动。市上物价疯狂上涨，青岛晚报写道：“鲁境的大势命运告终了，各县城于克复后相继的或因为‘失却军事价值’，或由于‘战略转移’而弃守了，鲁境完整的县份已寥寥无几，思想起来好不伤感人也。”民言报在社论上抱怨蒋介石抽调范汉杰部增援辽西说：“我们未见辽西增防后扩大战果，却正如一般预料山东立刻呈现不稳，辽西的地位虽不比山东低，可是十个辽西也不可能换回威海卫、龙口、石臼所，更不用提潍县撤守的损失了。”由于军事败北，青岛市金钞价格现已超过京沪物价暴涨不已，青岛报载黄金黑市超出京沪一千余万元，美钞高出京沪数十万元（蒋币下同）。自四月三十日至五月十三日双龙细布每匹由四百四十四万涨至六百八十四万。兵，兵船牌面粉每袋由二百八十万涨至三百六十五万。青岛政府当局把物价上涨的责任，都往商人身上推，警察宪兵到处逮捕商人，但是物价仍继续上涨。
