　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. Harbin has a large number of foreign nationals. This reporter specifically visited Mayor Zhu Qiwen to inquire about the current situation of foreign nationals in Harbin. According to him, Harbin's foreign nationals include 33,721 residents from over twenty countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Denmark, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Sweden, Iran, and Korea. There are forty-one churches, including the Polish Saint Stanislaus Catholic Church, the French Lutheran Church, the British Alfred Gregorian Church, the Soviet St. Sophia Christian Church, and the Jewish Church; twenty-one charitable institutions, including the Niefkiev Catholic Relief Home, the Jewish Old Age Home, the Polish Old Age Home, and the Jiefu Weichi Nursery; seven hospitals, including Guo Luniv, Kazanbek, and Jewish hospitals; the French Girls' Orphanage; the Polish School; the Jewish School; the Tatar School; the Medical School; the Advanced Music School; the Haza Accounting School; the Wuerlanli Girls' Middle School; and nineteen schools, including the Foreign Language Preaching Center run by the Soviet expatriate association. Mayor Zhu stated: The democratic government adopts a firm policy of protecting and supporting the various undertakings run by foreign nationals, provided that they abide by the laws of the democratic government and do not engage in espionage or sabotage activities. In the past two years, the Harbin democratic government has allowed freedom of religion, strictly prohibited military, government, and civilian organizations from occupying churches, and protected their legal property. Regarding the education of foreign nationals, because there are many young children of foreign nationals in the city, in order to respect their customs, habits, languages, and writing, and to develop education for foreign nationals, a Foreign Nationals Education Section has been set up in the Municipal Education Bureau. In addition to assisting their educational work, it also provides financial subsidies. Currently, the monthly subsidy for the salaries of foreign teachers alone reaches 6.36 million Northeast circulation coupons. This year, it also assisted Korean expatriates in establishing one middle school and four primary schools. The government treats the many elderly, orphans, and destitute among foreign nationals as compatriots, regularly subsidizing them with food and clothing. Mayor Zhu also explained in detail that foreign nationals in Harbin have achieved great development in operating industry and commerce in the past year. Currently, there are 726 industrial and commercial enterprises operated by foreign nationals from twenty countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and Germany. Among them, the 322 industrial enterprises are operated by fourteen countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, covering forty-seven types of industries, including textiles, ironwork, leather, matches, electrical materials, pharmaceuticals, printing, food, and pigments. The total capital is 16,211,856,000 yuan, with 2,872 employees. According to statistics from 1947, 236 of the above-mentioned industrial enterprises were profitable, accounting for 74% of the total, with a total profit of 639,322,200 yuan; 55 enterprises broke even, accounting for 17%; and 31 enterprises suffered losses, accounting for 9%. There are 404 commercial enterprises operated by sixteen countries, including Yugoslavia and Austria, with a total capital of 49,904,822,000 yuan. Last year, 331 enterprises were profitable, accounting for 82% of the total; 33 enterprises broke even, accounting for 8.2%; and 40 enterprises suffered losses, accounting for 9.9%. Mayor Zhu pointed out that the number of foreign-owned industrial and commercial enterprises in Harbin has increased by 193 compared to the 535 during the Japanese puppet Manchukuo era in 1944. The main reason for their development is that foreign merchants have obtained the protection and support of the democratic government while complying with the laws of our democratic government, especially the government's efforts to provide assistance with raw materials and power during the war. Since the industrial and commercial registration in February, foreign businessmen's confidence has further increased. Recently, five more industrial enterprises and more than ten commercial enterprises have applied to start businesses. For example, Soviet merchant Ximolianke and others raised 38.3 million yuan to prepare for the establishment of the Oriental Industrial Company, which will mass-produce rubber shoes and plans to increase its capital to 70 million yuan. Gusev invested in agricultural production, and the government has agreed to lease 1,300 hectares of land. Tractors have been collected, and cultivation will begin soon. The government also adopts a policy of protecting the industrial and commercial enterprises and properties of foreign nationals who return to their home countries for business, so as not to allow them to be suspended or infringed upon, either by entrusting them to an agent or by requesting the government to manage them on their behalf, continuing their operations and preserving their property. Currently, our court has on file 119 cases of industrial and commercial enterprises, houses, and family businesses under trusteeship, belonging to foreign nationals from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Iran, and stateless persons. Although most of them are cases from the puppet Manchukuo era, our government also recognizes their validity. Mayor Zhu finally stated: The above shows that foreign nationals in the jurisdiction of the democratic government are not allowed to have privileges on the one hand, and on the other hand, as long as they respect the laws of our government and do not engage in sabotage activities, they enjoy the same treatment as our people. Therefore, we have been able to eliminate the estrangement between Chinese and foreigners in this very short period of time, and have improved the concept of foreign nationals respecting the policies and laws of our democratic government, further strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and foreign people.

　　哈市妥善保护外侨
    政府对贫苦无依者经常补助
  　千余家外侨工商业均获发展
    【新华社东北七日电】哈尔滨市外侨甚多，记者特走访朱其文市长就询目前哈市外侨情况，据称：哈市外侨包括苏联、美国、英国、法国、捷克、意大利、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、瑞士、南斯拉夫、丹麦、奥大利、希腊、土耳其、葡萄牙、瑞典、伊朗、朝鲜等二十余国计有侨民三万三千七百廿一人，有波兰圣斯坦尼斯拉夫天主教，法国路得教会，英国阿尔佛格列果连教堂，苏联圣索菲亚基督教，犹太教等教堂四十一座，涅夫基天主教救济院，犹太养老院、波兰养老院，节夫维赤保育院等慈善机关廿一所，郭鲁尼夫，卡赞别克，犹太等七个医院，法国女子孤儿院，波兰学校，犹太学校，靼靼学校，医学校，高级音乐学校，哈乍会计学校，乌尔兰里女子中学，及苏联侨民会办的外国语传教所等学校十九处。朱市长称：民主政府对外侨所主办之各种事业只要其遵守民主政府法令，不作敌探和破坏活动，均采坚决保护和扶持的方针。两年来哈市民主政府允许信教自由，严禁军政民机关团体占用教堂，并保护其合法财产。关于外侨教育问题，由于本市侨民青年儿童很多为尊重其风俗习惯语言文字，发展侨民教育，特在市教育局内设外侨教育科，除协助其教育工作外，并予以经费上的补助，目前仅补助外侨教员薪金每月即达东北流通券六百三十六万元。并于今年协助朝鲜侨民成立中学一所，小学四所。对外侨中的不少的残老孤儿贫苦无依者，政府亦待若同胞，经常补助其粮食和衣物。朱市长并特别详细的说明近一年来外侨在哈市经营工商业获得很大发展，现哈市外侨经营工商业者有苏联、美国、德国、意大利等二十个国家，共七百二十六家，其中经营工业者有苏、美、英、德等十四国包括纺织、铁工、皮革、火柴、电料、制药、印刷、食品、颜料等四十七种共三百二十二家，资本总额为一百六十二亿一千一百八十五万六千元，职工人数二千八百七十二人。据一九四七年统计上述工业获利者计二百卅六家，占总数百分之七十四，共盈利六亿三千九百三十二万二千元，收支相抵者五十五家，占百分之十七，亏损者三十一家，占百分之九。经营商业者有南斯拉夫、奥大利等十六国共四百零四家，资本总数为四百九十九亿零四百八十二万二千元。去年获利者三百三十一家，占总数百分之八十二，收支相抵者三十三家，占百分之八点二，亏损者四十家，占百之九点九。朱市长指出哈市外侨工商业较一九四四年伪满时代的五百卅五家增加达一百九十三家，其获得发展的主要原因为侨商在遵守我民主政府法令下，获得了民主政府的保护与扶持，特别是政府在战争期间多方设法给以原料及动力的帮助。自二月经过工商业登记后，外侨经营信心更加提高，最近要求新开业者又有工业五家，商业十余家。如苏商西莫连柯等九人集资三千八百三十万元筹备东方实业公司，大批制造胶皮鞋，并计划再增资到七千万元。古赛夫投资农业生产，政府已允租一千三百垧地，现拖拉机已筹齐，不日即可开始耕种。政府对因事回国的外侨工商业及其财产为不使其停顿或被侵犯，也一样采取保护政策，或由其本人委托代管，或请求政府代管，继续经营，并保管其财产。现我法院已存案代管的工商业、房屋、家业等计有苏、美、英、波、伊朗及无国籍的外侨一百十九户，虽然其中大部系伪满时的存案，但我政府亦承认其有效。朱市长最后称：以上说明在民主政府管辖区内的外侨，一方面不容许有特权，另一方面只要尊重我政府法令不作破坏活动，得享受与我人民同等的待遇，因此我们能在这很短的期间消除了中外人士的隔阂，并提高了外侨尊重我民主政府政策与法令的观念，进一步加强了中外人民的友谊。
