　　[Shahe News] Spring ploughing production in Taziyu Village, Third District, has initially gained vitality after resolving the ideological obstacles and some specific difficulties of the farmers. Currently, the masses are urgently demanding the rectification of mutual aid. For example, Duan Jingzhuo said: "If the mutual aid groups are not reorganized immediately, not to mention improving production, it will hinder production." Duan Xiuhe said: "I didn't sympathize with the so-called big mutual aid last year." Qin Jing said: "No matter how much work credit I get, I can't stand the leader's temper. Anyway, if I have to join again, I will jump out of the group." Because last year, in the mutual aid groups, good and bad labor were given the same work credit, the households with good labor and livestock suffered losses. Immediately, the cadres made self-criticisms. For example, Duan Lainen, the director of the farmers' association, said: "Last year, when organizing mutual aid, we said it was based on the voluntary association of the masses, but we always had to get the masses to form large mutual aid groups (standard was at least ten households). Anyone who didn't participate in mutual aid could not go out to sell persimmons without the group leader's stamp. These were all our leadership's mistakes (the twelve group leaders all had a stamp made to control the masses' freedom of production)." Duan Changxi, the production committee member, said: "Last year, households with labor and livestock were all combined, leaving those without labor aside. The cadres forced the households without labor into each group. Some bachelors did work for households without labor and asked them to make a pair of shoes, which was a high price for labor. The bachelors reflected that one day of work could not even be exchanged for a woman's labor." Duan Xiaosan, the mutual aid group leader, said: "At the end of the year, we forced everyone to invest in the mutual aid group for sideline production. Anyone who didn't invest couldn't go out to do business." Further discussion on how to rectify the situation revealed that some people did not dare to express their opinions because they had suffered losses in the mutual aid groups in the past. The cadres were afraid that after voluntary association, the strong would pair with the strong and the weak with the weak, leaving those without labor behind. Therefore, the final rectification methods discussed were: (1) Cadres should first admit their past leadership errors in front of the masses, such as forced organization, control, and coercion; (2) Mobilize all the masses participating in mutual aid groups to raise opinions and solve outstanding problems; (3) First hold a meeting of households without labor, let them first raise the difficulties in production, and then discuss how to solve them, breaking the past reliance or waiting for others to cultivate for them, and actively seeking households with labor; (4) This year, rectification must be carried out based on the voluntary association of the masses.

　　塔子峪打破强制互助
    【沙河消息】三区塔子峪村的春耕生产，经过解决农民的思想障碍及一些具体困难，生产工作初步有了生气。当前群众迫切要求整顿互助。如段景琢说：互助组再不马上整理整理，不用说提高生产，还防碍生产。段修合说：“去年叫大互助我就不同情。”秦景说：“给我顶工多少我不说，实在受不了组长的气，反正再要结合我要跳跳组。”因为去年互助组内不管好赖都一样顶工，结果劳畜好的户吃了亏。随即干部作了检讨，如农会主任段赖年说：去年组织互助，说吧是听群众自愿结合，可是总得叫群众结合成大组互助（标准至少十户），谁要不参加互助，没有组长盖章，即不能出去卖柿子。这都是咱领导上的错误（十二个组组长都刻了一个管制群众自由生产的戳）。生产委员段昌喜说：去年有劳力有畜力的户都结合起来了，把没劳力的剩在一边，干部就硬把没劳力的户塞到各组里，有的光棍汉给没劳力户做了活，叫她们给做一对鞋，工价顶大，光棍汉们反映说：俺做一天活还换不了个妇女工。互助组长段小三说：年时个搞副业硬逼的谁也往互助组集股，谁不集，一个也不能出去做买卖。再进一步讨论到如何整顿时，因有人过去在互助组吃了亏也不敢提意见，干部怕自愿结合后，兵对兵将对将，把无劳力的摔出来，故最后讨论出整顿办法：（一）干部先在群众面前承认过去领导上的强编、管制、硬逼等错误；（二）发动所有参加互助组的群众提出意见，解决遗留问题；（三）先开个无劳力户会议，让她们先提出生产中的困难，然后讨论如何解决，打破过去依靠或等叫别人代耕思想，去主动的找有劳力户；（四）今年一定叫群众自愿结合来进行整顿。（秦政民、国万英）
