　　The Battle to Seize the Jade Emperor Temple Peak
    Ke Ren
    In the battle to capture the Jade Emperor Temple Peak north of Linfen city, the local armed forces, established only half a year prior, launched their first siege, successfully seizing the enemy's multi-layered defensive fortifications. This stronghold was one of the highest points on the city wall, over five zhang above ground, covering an area of more than twenty mu. The enemy defended it with four companies of troops. The People's Liberation Army, with less than three companies, took only a little over an hour of battle to completely occupy this key point. This is a victory of our military democracy. Before the battle, the People's Liberation Army implemented widespread military democracy. When the mission was announced, it immediately sparked conscious action among the soldiers. They actively sought solutions, often forgetting to eat while surveying the terrain. Everyone practiced at night less than 100 meters from the enemy. A platoon leader climbed the fortifications in the drizzling rain to scout the terrain. The enemy panicked and threw grenades, but they remained calm and measured the distance outside the moat. Because everyone truly understood the situation and came up with countermeasures, the cadres felt relaxed and happy about accepting the mission, and the soldiers happily said, "Even if we are cut off from command, we will still know what to do." Liberated soldier Wang Zhongfa, despite being wounded in the arm, still requested to participate in the attack. He said, "I may not be able to throw grenades, but I can still carry ammunition." At dusk on the 14th, when the battle unfolded, everyone rushed forward after a fierce artillery bombardment. Soldier Bai Sheng said, "Let's go! If we can't cover the troops going up, we'll take responsibility." Saying this, he ignored his injuries, got up, and threw grenades at the enemy. The troops swarmed forward, and the enemy defending the first line was frightened by the People's Liberation Army's surging morale and ran away. When they ran out of grenades, they picked them up from the enemy's fortifications and threw them back at them. During the intermittent advance, they were temporarily blocked by the second trench, but because everyone had observed the terrain beforehand and noticed the enemy constantly moving back and forth from the northwest, Platoon Leader Liu Changteng commanded a feigned attack from the east of the position to attract the enemy's fire, while he led the advance towards the northwest. As they approached the enemy's position, Xu Zikuan bravely removed the barbed wire, and the troops surged up the path like a torrent. Finally, the panicked enemy on the upper-level position dropped their machine guns and the telephone they were using to call for help, and fled into the tunnels. The position was thus occupied by the courageous and resourceful People's Liberation Army.

　　夺取玉皇庙顶的战斗
    克仁
    攻占临汾城北之玉皇庙顶战斗中，解放军成立仅仅半年的地方武装初次攻坚，一举占领敌人复层的防御工事。该据点为城垣制高点之一，高出地面五丈余，占有面积二十余亩，敌以四连兵力据守，解放军却以不到三连的兵力经一小时许的战斗，即全部占领此一要点，这是我们军事民主的胜利。战斗前解放军实行了普遍的军事民主，当任务宣布后，立刻引起战士们的自觉行动，他们主动的想办法，常常因为看地形而忘了吃饭，大家在距敌不到一百米达内乘夜演习，架设排长于细雨蒙蒙中爬上工事侦察地形，敌人慌得拉雷投弹，可是他们仍镇静地在外壕前测量距离，由于大家确实了解情况想出对策，干部接受任务觉得轻松愉快，战士高兴的说：“就是脱离了指挥也有办法。”解放战士王忠发虽然臂部负伤，仍要求参加攻击，他说：“我不能投弹还能运弹。”十四号黄昏战斗展开时，经过一阵猛烈炮火的轰击，大家即争先恐后而出，战士白生说：“加油干，不能掩护部队上去咱要负责”，说着不顾伤痛爬起来就向敌人投弹，部队即蜂拥而上，守备第一线的敌人被解放军旺盛的士气给吓跑了。没有了手榴弹便到敌人工事里去拾，再向敌人打去，在断续前进中，一时被二道交通壕拦住去路，但由于大家事前观察地形时已发现敌人不断从西北来往，此时连长刘长腾指挥，从阵地以东佯攻，吸引敌人火力，他却指挥向西北方向前进，在接近敌人阵地时，徐子宽奋勇拔去铁丝网，部队从小路上象洪流一样冲上，最后上层阵地慌的敌人摔下手中的机枪和正在告急的电话机，向地道逃去，该阵地遂为智勇的解放军占领。
