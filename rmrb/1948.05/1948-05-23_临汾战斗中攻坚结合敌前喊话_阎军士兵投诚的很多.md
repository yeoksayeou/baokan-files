(This dispatch from Taiyue, dated the 19th by our newspaper) Soldiers Li Fugui, Wang Laicheng, and Dong Fuguan, along with squad leader Shang Hongjun and more than ten others from the 7th and 8th Companies of the Yan bandit police regiment, who laid down their arms in the Linfen campaign, recounted their experience. They said, "Your (referring to the People's Liberation Army, hereinafter the same) tunnels kept digging towards the front and side of our Luanren Tomb position. This really scared us. If you set off explosives, wouldn't we 'fly' with the bunkers? But the superiors kept ordering us to 'coexist with the position' and announced four capital punishment disciplines: 1. Those who waver will be killed; 2. Those who retreat will be killed; 3. Those who mutiny will be killed; 4. Those who sabotage or shake the morale of the army will be killed. But we thought, the station and the electric company have several outer moats, power grids, and barbed wire, such solid fortifications that you have captured. How can we hold this fortification? On the 23rd and 24th, our 7th Company commander was wounded and escaped, and the 8th Company commander was seriously wounded in the station battle. Four out of six platoon leaders were injured, and two ran away secretly. They said they were going to the electric company to get in touch, but they never came back. Our two companies were left with only thirty-odd people. We felt that continuing to defend would only lead to death.

On the evening of the 24th, you shouted to us: 'Those who surrender will not be killed; those who want to work can stay, those who don't want to can go home.' At first, we didn't quite believe it. The officers said that 'those who surrender will be buried alive.' Later, you said again: 'Putting down your weapons will absolutely guarantee your safety.' We started to calculate: retreat means beheading, and defense will eventually lead to being blown up. If surrendering really means not being killed, then it is a way out. With a way out, why not give it a try? The company commander and platoon leader were either injured or escaped. Who cares about these things? So we all decided to surrender, but no one dared to say what was on their minds.

Dong Fuguan had been captured by you in Yuncheng before. That night, Li Fugui came back from sentry duty, and Fuguan asked: 'Did you hear people shouting to surrender?' Fugui said: 'I heard it.' Fuguan then said: 'What do you think we should do?' Fugui said: 'Let's surrender.' The two of them discussed it and then consulted with their confidant Li Guodong. Guodong agreed, and they immediately went to collude with others. Soon, everyone in the entire 8th Company agreed to surrender. Shang Hongjun, the squad leader of the 5th squad of the 7th Company, saw this situation and was anxious to discuss it with the soldiers. He said, 'Everyone sees that we are surrounded now, and there is only one way to die. Let's find a way.' Everyone said in unison: 'You are the squad leader, you tell us.' Shang Hongjun said: 'Let's surrender.' Everyone answered in unison: 'No objection, we've wanted to surrender for a long time.' So we sent Li Fugui to carry the telephone, expressing our determination to contact your officers. After the contact was made, we happily brought our weapons over."

　　临汾战斗中攻坚结合敌前喊话
  　阎军士兵投诚的很多
    【本报太岳十九日电】在临汾战役中放下武器的阎匪保警二十九团七、八两连士兵李福贵、王来成、董福官，班长尚鸿钧等十余人，诉述他们七、八两连放下武器经过时说：“你们（指解放军，下同）的坑道一直向我们栾人坟阵地的前面和侧面挖来，这可把我们吓坏了，如果埋上炸药，我们不是要和碉堡一同‘坐飞机’吗？上级却连下命令要我们‘与阵地共存亡’，又宣布了四项杀头纪律：一、动摇者杀，二、撤退者杀，三、兵变者杀，四、进行破坏和动摇军心者杀。但我们想车站和电灯公司有几道外壕、电网、铁丝网，那样坚固的工事都被你们打下来了，我们这工事还能守住？二十三、二十四两天，我们七连连长负伤逃跑了，八连连长在车站战斗已负重伤，六个排长有四个带彩，两个偷跑了，他们走时说是去电灯公司取联系，可是都不回来了，我们两个连打的只剩下三十多个人了，我们感到守下去只有死路一条。
    二十四晚上，你们向我们喊话说：‘缴枪不杀，愿干就干，不愿干就回家’。起初我们还不大相信，当官的说过‘投降也要被活埋’，后来你们又说：‘放下武器绝对保证安全。’我们就盘算开了，退是杀头，守呢终归要炸死，投降果真要不杀的话就是一条活路；有了活路，为什么不去碰一碰呢？连长、排长伤的伤逃的逃，谁还管这些事，于是我们都打定主意投降，但这心里的话谁也不敢说。
    董福官过去在运城就被你们俘掳过，那天夜里李福贵放哨回来，福官就问：‘你听见人家叫喊投降来吗’？福贵说：‘听见了’。福官接着又说：‘你说这该怎么办？’福贵说：‘投降就投降吧’。他两人商量好，又和知心的李国栋商量，国栋也同意，立即分头串通，一会儿全八连的人都同意投降了。七连五班班长尚鸿钧看见这种情形，也急的找士兵们商量，他说：‘大家看现在咱们是被包围住了，只有一条死路，大家想办法吧’。大家都同声说：‘你是班长你说吧’。尚鸿钧说：‘投降吧’。大家同声的回答：‘没意见，我们早就想投降’。于是我们派李福贵背上电话机，表示决心去和你们长官接头；接洽好了，我们便欢天喜地的带着武器过来了。”
