　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet "New Times" magazine published an important May Day editorial, stating:

　　The Soviet Union is commemorating May Day with tremendous achievements in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life. The Soviet Union is victoriously recovering from the serious wounds left by the war and is confidently and firmly advancing along the path of progress and prosperity.

　　Every People's Democratic country is effectively striving towards socialism along its own unique path. In the People's Democratic countries of Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc., the urgent task of uniting the forces of the working class into a single party guided by Marxist-Leninist principles has been completed or is nearing completion. This unity helps to multiply the strength of the working class vanguard and enhance its role as the recognized leader of the working masses.

　　In the past year, the ties between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have been further strengthened and consolidated. The basis of their cooperation is the faithful adherence to the principle of equality between large and small nations and mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and legitimate rights and interests.

　　In this part of the world, the banner of democracy and socialism leads everything. In contrast to the scene of peaceful construction in this part, the camp ruled by imperialism and reaction presents a terrible scene of desolation: increasingly growing economic disorder, increasingly reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the ruling class, unscrupulous infringement upon the vital interests of the masses, increasing oppression and tyranny, and cultural degradation and poverty. The countries of Europe being Marshallized have been designated to play the role of American bridgehead fortresses and cannon fodder suppliers. Wall Street banker Harriman, in the capacity of an American imperial envoy, has come to Western Europe from across the Atlantic to implement the so-called aid to Europe plan of handing the rope to the hanging man. But the policies of the imperialist camp's wire-pullers and their running dogs, the right-wing Social Democrats, are being resisted by the broad masses throughout the world.

　　In the United States, the fortress of modern imperialism, increasingly loud and strong voices of protest can be heard from under the oppression of militarist and fascist reactionary laws. The initial election campaigns have revealed the rising activities of progressive and democratic elements, who are receiving a broad response from the masses.

　　In Western European countries, the treacherous policies of the ruling reactionary "American Party" are arousing increasing anger among all true patriots and progressive-minded men and women. The results of the Italian parliamentary elections on April 18th are a stern warning to imperialism.

　　At the same time, the rear of the imperialist system is being devastated by the increasingly strengthened national liberation movements of the colonial peoples.

　　Like the phoenix reborn from the ashes, new democratic China is rising and has already controlled the land of 170 million people. Just on the eve of May Day, the news of the liberation of Yan'an, the former capital of democratic China, has arrived. The people of Indonesia and Vietnam have never surrendered to those colonialists who are fighting with American weapons and diplomatic deception. In vast areas of India, the policies of the imperialists and their running dogs in the ruling class cannot solve any of the pressing problems of the people.

　　A wolf cannot change its nature. The imperialists are now trying to seek a way out of their predicament by engaging in foreign adventures and inciting a new world war. But the strength of the democratic front is sufficient to crush the sinister plots of imperialism. In all countries, the true friends of peace always constitute the vast majority of the population. As long as they are firmly determined to protect peace, crush the imperialist plans to enslave all countries, and expose the tricks of the new war conspirators, the conspiracies of the enemies of peace will surely be shattered.

　　苏联“新时代”五一节社论
  　世界民主阵营无比强大
  　新民主中国正在兴起
  　反动营垒现出一幅萧条景象
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联新时代杂志发表五一节重要社论，内称：
    苏联以政治、经济与文化生活各方面的巨大成绩来纪念五一节。苏联正胜利恢复战争所遗留的严重创伤，并且正满怀信心，坚定地沿着进步与繁荣的大道奋力前进。
    每一个人民民主国家，都正循着自己独特的道路，有效地向着社会主义奋力迈进。在罗、匈、波、捷等人民民主国家中，把工人阶级的力量，团结在马列主义原则为行动指针的单一政党中的这一迫切任务，已经完成或近于完成了。这种团结，有助于倍增工人阶级先锋队的力量，并提高其作为公认的劳动大众领导者的作用。
    在过去一年中，苏联与各人民民主国家间的联系，已更益加强和稳固。它们合作的基础是忠实遵守大小国家平等的原则，互相尊重彼此主权与正当权益。
    在世界这一部分中，民主与社会主义的旗帜领导一切。与这一部分努力和平建设的情景相对照，帝国主义与反动派力最所统治的阵营，呈现出一幅可怕萧条的情景：经济上日益增长的紊乱、统治阶级越来越反动的内外政策、对大众切身利益肆无忌惮的侵害、日益增加的压迫与暴政以及文化的堕落与贫乏。欧洲马歇尔化的国家，已被指定扮演美国桥头堡垒与炮灰供应者的角色。华尔街银行家的心复代理人哈里曼，以美国巡按的资格，自大西洋彼岸到了西欧，便是要实现把绳子交给上吊人的所谓援欧计划。但是帝国主义阵营牵线人及其走狗右翼社会党的政策，正遭到全世界广大群众的抵抗。
    在美国这一现代帝国主义的堡垒中，从军国主义与法西斯主义的反动法律的压迫下面，已经可以听到越来越响亮与强烈的抗议呼声。初期的竞选运动已显露出进步与民主分子的活动日益高涨，他们受到群众广泛的响应。
    在西欧各国，当权的反动“美国党”背信弃义的政策，在一切真正的爱国者与有进步思想的男女之间，正激起增涨不已的愤怒。意大利四月十八日议会选举的结果，是对帝国主义的一次严厉警告。
    同时，帝国主义制度的后方，正受到殖民地人民民族解放运动日益加强的摧毁。
    正如自灰炉中再生的涅般凤凰一般，新民主的中国正在兴起，并已控制了一亿七千万人口的土地。恰在五一节前夕，传来了民主中国前首都延安解放的消息。印尼和越南人民决未向那些正以美国武器和外交欺诈来作战的殖民者表示屈服。在印度广大的地区，帝国主义者及其在统治阶级中的走狗的政策，不能解决人民的任何一个迫切问题。
    狼的本性难移，帝国主义者现正力图从国外冒险和煽动新的世界大战来寻求摆脱困境的出路。但是民主阵线的强大，足够摧垮帝国主义的罪恶阴谋。在一切国家里，和平的忠实友人，总是占人口中的绝大多数。只要他们有坚定的决心保护和平，摧垮帝国主义奴役各国的计划，并揭露新战争阴谋家的诡计，和平之敌的阴谋，一定将被粉碎。
