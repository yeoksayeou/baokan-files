　　Soviet Folk Tale: Andrei and the Divine Eagle
    In the Soviet Union, there was a village where an old man and an old woman lived, and they lived a very poor life. The old man watched as his whole family was about to starve to death. What to do? The old man sent his son, Andrei, to find happiness. Andrei was walking on the road and came to a fork in the road. There stood a pole with words written on it: "Go right - to the bear; go left - to the divine eagle." Andrei thought for a long time and decided to take the left road. The next morning, Andrei saw a radiant sun, and on top of the sun stood a divine eagle.
    The divine eagle said to Andrei, "Where are you going?"
    Andrei replied, "My family is too poor to live on, I'm going to find happiness." The eagle called Andrei closer and said to him, "Happy days are to be fought for. Take this wooden stick and go back. On the way, you will encounter a bear. Use the stick to kill the bear, cut open its belly, and a golden box will fall out from there. Open that box, and you will find happy days." Andrei listened to the divine eagle's words, he killed the bear, took out the small box, opened it, and a sow and a ewe jumped out of the box. Andrei returned home, very content. Life was a little better, but still far from happy days, so he decided to go find happiness again. He met the divine eagle again, and the divine eagle asked him, "Andrei, where are you going again?" Andrei told him everything in detail. The divine eagle said: "Okay, here's a wooden stick for you, go back. You will encounter a wolf. Kill it, cut open its belly, there's a small box, and you can live a good life." Andrei did everything the divine eagle said. He opened the small box, and a cow and a horse jumped out of it. Andrei contentedly returned home. After living at home for some time, he felt that he was still far from happy days, and he decided to go find happiness again. He met the eagle again, and said that life was always difficult. The divine eagle said: "Okay, go back, you will encounter a fox, kill it. In the place where you kill it, you will find your happy life." Andrei did as the divine eagle said. He encountered a fox in his own village, killed it, and could not recognize his own village. The current village is built with tile-roofed houses, the warehouses are full of grain, and the pens are full of cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks. On the main house of this village are written four large characters - Collective Farm.
    In this way, poor Andrei killed the bear emperor, the wolf landlord, and the fox rich peasant, and finally found his own happy life.
    The divine eagle who showed poor Andrei the way, his name is Stalin.

　　苏联民间故事：安德礼和神鹰
    在苏联，有一个村子里，住着一个老头和一个老大娘，他们过的日子很穷。老头子眼看着全家人将要饿死了。怎么办呢？老头子就派了自己的儿子安德礼，找幸福去。安德礼在路上走着，走到岔路口上了，那儿竖着一根杆子，杆子上写着字：“向右走——到狗熊那里；向左走——到神鹰那里。”安德礼想了很久，决定走左的路。第二天早上，安德礼看见一个光辉的太阳，太阳上面站住一个神鹰。
    神鹰向安德礼说：“你上那里去？”
    安德礼回答说：“我家里实在穷的没法过，我去找幸福去。”鹰把安德礼叫到跟前，对他说：“幸福的日子，是要斗争的。你把这一根木棒拿住，走回去吧。在路上你要碰到一只狗熊，用木棒把狗熊打死，把它肚子剖开，有一个金小盒就从那儿倒出来。你把那盒子打开，你就找到幸福日子了。”安德礼听了神鹰的话，他打死了狗熊，取出了小盒，打开一看，一只母猪和母羊就从那盒子里跳出来了。安德礼回　到家，恣的很。日子好一点了，但是离开幸福的日子，还是很远，他决定再去找幸福去。他又碰到了神鹰，那神鹰就问他道：“安德礼，你又上那里去？”安德礼就一五一十的把一切都告诉了他。神鹰说：好吧，给你一根木棒，你回去吧，你将要碰到一只狼。把它打死，把它肚子剖开，有一个小盒，你就可以过好日子了。安德礼把神鹰所说的话统统照着作了。他打开了小盒，一只母牛和一匹马，就从那儿跳出来了。安德礼恣的回了家。在家里住了一些日子，觉得离开幸福的日子还很远，他决定再去找幸福。他又碰到了鹰，说生活总是困难。神鹰说：“好吧，你回去吧，你将要碰到一只狐狸，你打死它。在你打死它的地方，你就找到你的幸福的生活了。”安德礼照神鹰的话作了。他就在自己的本村里，遇到一只狐狸，打死了它，看着自己的村子就认不出来了，现在的村子，修盖的是房，仓库里满盛着粮食，牛羊、鸡鸭满栏。这村子的正屋上，写着很大的四个字——集体农村。
    这么样，穷的安德礼打死了狗熊皇帝、狼地主和狐狸富农，终于找到了自己幸福的生活了。
    给穷的安德礼指示这条路的那个神鹰，他的名字就叫斯大林。
