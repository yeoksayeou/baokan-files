　　News from this newspaper: In early May, the local armed forces of the Fifth District of Northern Henan struck against invading enemies and won successive victories. At approximately 11:00 AM on May 2nd, more than 70 enemy troops from Kuai Village attacked. A unit of our Huixian Brigade launched a fierce attack on the enemy, chasing them to Xiaoying. After a ten-minute battle, three enemy security team members, including the 15th company commander, were killed or wounded, and two were captured alive. We suffered no casualties. On the night of the 1st, more than a thousand bandits under Guo Qing from Anyang invaded our Sun Taoji area in Yexian County to loot grain and conscript soldiers. On the morning of the 2nd, they were repelled by our Yexian Brigade, with four enemies killed or wounded. At the same time, more than 20 enemy township government armed personnel stationed in Tunziji, Tangyin County, attacked, entering an ambush set by our Tangyin Battalion troops near Beicheng (southeast of Yangcheng). After several minutes of battle, three enemies were captured, and one light machine gun was seized. We suffered no casualties. On the morning of the 4th, two battalions of the 117th Regiment of the Chiang bandit 40th Division stationed in Anyang, combined with two companies of the bandit Liu Lexian's troops, attacked Gaicun and Jiajiagang to loot grain. Upon receiving the news, our Second Detachment divided into three routes to attack the enemy. After a two-hour battle, the enemy was routed, with over 40 killed or wounded, and one captured. At dawn on the 11th, a unit of our First Detachment ambushed in a wheat field near Liuhuang Village, 20 miles north of Tangyin City. On the morning of that day, 18 armed personnel from the puppet township government stationed in Weijiaying attacked and fell into our ambush. Except for three who escaped, all were annihilated. Four enemies, including the company commander, were killed or wounded, and eleven enemies, including the squad leader, were captured alive. One light machine gun and thirteen rifles were seized.
