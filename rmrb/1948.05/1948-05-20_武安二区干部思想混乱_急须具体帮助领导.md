　　[Wu'an News] On April 25th, the Second District convened a meeting of 160 village cadres from the entire district to review the production work of the past half-month. From the perspective of the entire district, cadres and the masses have initially been mobilized in production. However, there are still many problems. The primary issue is the ideological confusion among cadres. Several cadres stated in their self-criticisms at the meeting: Being a cadre now is difficult in three ways: (1) It is difficult to come to the district for meetings, and self-criticism at meetings leads to further criticism. (2) It is difficult to serve the masses. Gathering the masses for meetings is unsuccessful, and work cannot be carried out. Now that democracy is being implemented, if you say a few words, some people immediately bring up the poor and hired peasants, constantly invoking them to block you. It is really impossible to do anything. (3) Trouble at home from parents and wives, who complain about being a cadre. After thinking it over, it is truly difficult, so they just wait for the masses to remove them. Some cadres are still unclear about democratic party rectification and do not know how to pass this test. Some say: "I have made mistakes in my work in the past, and I am sorry to the masses. Can I not change? However, some of the opinions raised by some people are not true, and I really cannot accept them. In production, I want to lead the masses to work hard, but this knot cannot be untied, and I am always uneasy, thinking that the masses are producing for themselves, so I should not interfere too much and cause trouble. Whatever the masses say, goes.”

　　The ideological confusion of district and village cadres has not been thoroughly resolved, and they dare not let go in organizing and leading village-level production. Now, some villages, after discussions in the farmers' associations, have formed production committees with good cadres and good party members as the main force, and have absorbed middle and poor peasants to participate, and have made arrangements for landlords, overcoming the chaos. However, some villages have not done this. In production, they kicked away the old foundation and only used a few poor and hired peasants to lead production, resulting in great chaos and constant damage to the interests of middle peasants, causing middle peasants to be afraid and passive in production. Secondly, in rectifying mutual aid, an overemphasis on democracy and voluntarism has led to the abandonment of leadership. Some cadres said: "In the past, I forced the masses to engage in mutual aid. Now, it is democratic and voluntary. Whoever wants to engage in mutual aid can do so, and whoever doesn't want to can quit. It is also convenient for everyone to do their own thing." Cadres dare not use administrative orders anymore, and they have no new methods, so they simply say, "Let's voluntarily combine for mutual aid." They also do not promote the benefits of organizing in the past, nor do they examine and settle the outstanding issues in the past mutual aid, nor do they explain the significance of rectifying mutual aid, resulting in free flow.

### 武安二区干部思想混乱　急须具体帮助领导

　　武安二区干部思想混乱
  　急须具体帮助领导
    【武安消息】二区四月二十五日召开一百六十人的全区村干部会议，检讨半月来的生产工作。从全区看，干部与群众在生产上都初步动起来了。但还有很多问题。首先是干部思想混乱。有几个干部在会上检讨说：现在当干部是三头为难：（一）来区上开会难，开会反省还要受批评。（二）为群众服务难。召集群众开会不来，工作弄不起来，现在实行民主，你说几句话吧，有些人张口贫雇，合口贫雇，就把咱顶住了，真没法干。（三）在家父母老婆给为难，埋怨不该当干部，左思右想实实难，只好等着群众来撤换自己。有的干部对民主整党直到现在不摸底，这一关不知怎样过。有的说：“咱过去在工作上有错误，对不起群众，咱还能不改？就是有些人提的意见不是那回事，咱真不能接受。生产中也想领导群众好好干，但这个疙瘩解不开，总是不安心，想着人家群众生人家的产，咱不要多管事惹人啦，群众说怎就怎。”
    区村干部思想混乱没得到彻底解决，对村级生产的组织领导即不敢放手干。现在有些村经过农会讨论，以好干部好党员为主，吸收中贫农参加，组成生产委员会，对地主作了安置，克服了混乱现象。但有些村没有这样做，生产中把老基础一脚踢开，只以几个贫雇领导生产，结果搞得十分混乱，损伤中农利益也不断发生，造成中农害怕，对生产消极。其次，在整顿互助中，一强调民主自愿，就放弃了领导。有的干部说：“过去咱强迫群众互助，现在民主自愿，谁想互助就互助，不想互助就拉倒，各搞各的也方便。”干部不敢再用行政命令，又没有新的做法，只好简单的说：“自愿结合互助吧”。对过去组织起来的好处也不宣传，对过去互助中的遗留问题也不检查清算，对整顿互助的意义也不讲解，形成了自流。　　（侯国英）
