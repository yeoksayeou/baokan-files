　　Combining Political Offensives to Suppress Scattered Bandits
  　Wanxi Captures 400 Local Chiang Elements

    [Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 20th] In recent days, the Wanxi People's Liberation Army, in areas such as Siping Town in Neixiang, has been combining political offensives with the suppression of scattered bandits. From the 11th to the 15th, they captured 466 local Chiang bandits, seized one mortar, sixteen light and heavy machine guns, 363 rifles and pistols, over 60,000 rounds of ammunition, one radio transmitter, forty-two head of livestock, and a quantity of military supplies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 20th] The first group of 487 captured officers and soldiers of the Neixiang and Zhenping local militia in the Wanxi campaign have been released. Some of them were lieutenants and captains, and most of them were poor peasants, forced into banditry by local bandit leaders such as Xue Bingling and Wang Jinsheng. They are extremely grateful for our lenient policy. Ten company-grade officers including Zhu Rongzong, Bai Qingshan, and Li Baoshan, formerly platoon leaders of the 1st Regiment of the Neixiang militia, have written to the democratic county government of Xixia (newly established county), guaranteeing that they will never be local Chiang bandits again, and that after returning home, they will cooperate with the democratic government to call on scattered bandits to return home and register. Each of them also guaranteed to mobilize at least three people to return home and hand over at least one gun to the democratic government.
