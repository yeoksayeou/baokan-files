    [This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th dispatch] Henan General Branch News: Since April 23rd, the enemy, mainly the Whole 5th Division, combined with the remnants of the 70th Division, 55th Division, and 68th Division, began to "sweep up" our Third and Fifth Sub-districts and the southern part of the Second Sub-district, implementing a policy of destruction. Our local army and people are bravely persisting in the hinterland struggle. The characteristics of the enemy's "sweeping-up" operations are generally the use of methods such as decentralized harassment and net-dragging, following our army's transfer operations, and wantonly destroying democratic village governments, capturing village cadres, young women, and strong men, and burning houses on a large scale. In Weiwang Village, Qibin County, a village of 300 households, was so badly damaged by the enemy that only three pots remained. The 143rd Brigade of the enemy Liu Ruming's army, even more inhumanely released poisonous gas, poisoning to death twelve militiamen and village cadres in a tunnel in Wang Village, Heze, a thousand people. After death, the bodies were carried out and chopped off with a guillotine, a tragic sight. Anlingji X Tun, Heze, has now been turned into a no-man's land by the Chiang bandits. Under the Chiang bandits' repeated devastation and trampling, the masses hated the Chiang bandits to the marrow, and rose up to defend themselves. A certain village in Cao County, an eighty-year-old woman, was forced to kill two Chiang special agents. The militia armed work team of the Third Sub-district, from April 23rd to 28th, fought a total of fourteen battles, killing eleven enemies, intercepting 260 chickens, more than sixty young women and strong men, and obtaining a bicycle, a cart, forty bombs, a part of bullets, and a part of wires. The Fanmiao armed work team in the Ma area of Shan County and Cao County heroically relied on tunnels to use landmines, killing and wounding thirty enemies in half a day of combat on the 29th with landmines, and repelling the siege of an infantry battalion of the 96th Brigade of the Enemy's 5th Division, fighting until dusk without any casualties on our side.
    [This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] The Model Class of the Yucheng County Militia Armed Work Team of the Fifth Sub-district of Henan Province heroically fought against the "sweeping-up". On April 15th, a battalion commander of the 200th Brigade of the enemy's 5th Army, along with a communications soldier and an army supply sergeant, went to Xumazhuang, the fourth district, to pull cattle, and were captured by our militia, capturing ten people and seizing one gun, and one American-style rifle. On the same day, a squad of the enemy went to Wudazhuang, the fifth district, to seize laborers, and our model class of four people seized three guns with bare hands, and drove the enemy away. The enemy then increased by a platoon, and our militia transferred into the tunnel. After the enemy found the entrance of the cave, they did not dare to go down, only cursing, "If you have the guts, come out and fight." Our militia also cursed in the cave, "If you have the guts, come down." The enemy finally left helplessly. Now, the Yucheng County Militia Armed Work Team of the Fifth Sub-district has captured more than fifty personnel from the 5th Army and fifty weapons, including 60 mortars, machine guns, submachine guns, and American-style rifles.
