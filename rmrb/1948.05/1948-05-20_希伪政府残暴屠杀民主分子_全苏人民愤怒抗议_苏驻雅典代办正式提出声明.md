Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Reports from various sources: Countries around the world continue to protest the atrocities of the Greek puppet government. On the 14th, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Athens, on the order of the Soviet government, sent a statement to Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, "calling the Greek government's attention to the outrage aroused among the Soviet people by this large-scale execution of democrats. The Soviet people hope for an immediate end to this execution, which violates the conscience of people around the world. The Soviet government shares this sentiment." Soviet newspapers also published a statement from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, demanding the cancellation of the death sentences for 1,500 Greek patriots and the release of all fighters for Greek freedom and independence. The committee also urged the World Federation of Trade Unions to take effective measures to stop the crimes of the Greek fascists and prevent the new, monstrous crimes they are plotting. Prominent Soviet scientists, writers, and artists such as Vavilov, Fadeyev, and Ehrenburg, loudly called for "putting away the evil sword that is covered with the blood of innocent people all over Greece." The Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, representing millions of Soviet women, demanded an end to the massacres of Greek anti-fascists. In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, a protest rally of 350,000 people was held the other day. At the meeting, General Trade Union Secretary Nico, representing 1.5 million Romanian workers, denounced "the interference of American and British imperialists in Greek internal affairs." The conference passed a resolution demanding that the United Nations immediately stop the monstrous crimes committed by the Greek fascists and ensure that foreign troops withdraw from Greece, allowing the Greek people to decide their own destiny. Similar meetings were held throughout Romania, and hundreds of protest letters were sent to newspapers for publication every day. The wave of protests against Greek fascist terror is surging in France, with tens of thousands of protest letters and telegrams being sent from all over the country. Hundreds of members of the "Free Austria Youth" group demonstrated in front of the Greek embassy in Vienna, shouting slogans such as "Murderous executioners," "The Marshall Plan means death to all anti-fascists," and "Down with fascism."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Rome News: The global movement to protest the atrocities of the Greek puppet government has saved the lives of thirty-one Greek patriots. On April 22nd, the Argentine fascist government deceived and extradited thirty-one Greek democrats to the Greek puppet government. However, when the ship they were on passed through the port of Naples on the 11th, Italian Popular Democratic Front Senator Tracinni and Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary Viterio, among others, lodged a strong protest with Gasperi, forcing him to agree to cancel the extradition of these patriots to the Greek puppet government. On the 11th, the Yugoslav embassy in Italy announced that Yugoslavia was willing to accept these patriots for refuge in Yugoslavia. On the same day, the Italian government ordered the police to escort these Greek patriots to the Yugoslav border, and the Italian Workers' Representative Council decided to send representatives to escort them.
