　　Production materials should be given to wrongly-labeled middle peasants even in non-fill-in villages
Editor：
　　Recently, the newspaper has been continuously publishing articles on correcting component classifications and restoring the rights of wrongly-labeled middle peasants. However, I have not seen any corrections in our county (Linzhang) yet. Who is responsible for initiating this matter? Is it the work team specifically responsible? Or is it the responsibility of the district personnel? If the fruits have already been distributed, how will compensation be made?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Qing Fu
Comrade Qing Fu:
　　In areas where fill-in work is being carried out, the correction of wrongly-labeled middle peasant status and compensation for losses are handled by the work team assisting the new peasant association. In areas where fill-in work is not being carried out, county and district cadres can be responsible for assisting the village peasant association to provide necessary living and production materials first, resolve difficulties, and restore their civil rights. The remaining losses will be compensated during fill-in work. If the fruits have already been distributed, appropriate consideration can be given in grain and loan provision. Formal compensation will be made when confiscating feudal property or when those who have turned over excessively return the excess fruits.

　　Civil rights of wrongly-labeled middle peasants should be restored immediately
Editor：
　　I have two questions, please answer: (1) Will wrongly-labeled middle peasants only have their civil rights restored during the fill-in? Especially many were wrongly labeled during the major movement last year, some not even qualifying as middle peasants. They were all struggled against by tracing three generations and estimating property. They say, "The fill-in will take two to three years, and we don't know if we can wait that long." They are eager to return to the ranks of the peasants. It would be best to have local cadres appropriately classify their class status first and restore the civil rights of wrongly-labeled middle peasants, so they can quickly stand with us.
　　Zhang Sigong
Comrade Zhang Sigong:
　　Your opinion is correct. Wrongly-labeled middle peasants should not only be given living materials but also have their civil rights restored immediately. This part of the masses should not be treated as landlords and rich peasants. Local cadres can be responsible for assisting the village peasant association to correct the component classifications of all wrongly-labeled households (but it is not necessary to re-classify the entire village) and resolve their difficulties.

Editor:
　　During the mass movement in Maidibian Village, Xingtai Seventh District, the winter before last year, four households (who were neither landlords nor rich peasants) were struggled against due to "political issues." Do these people have the right to vote now? Shen Zonghao in that village is an honest and hardworking person, not a landlord or rich peasant either, but he was struggled against the winter before last year because his brother had some "political issues." He doesn't even have food to eat right now. The masses in his group discussed this issue, and most people suggested that if the basic masses are facing the same difficulties as him, grain can be allocated to the basic masses first. But no decision was made in the end. Are these households considered basic masses? (Shen Wanhua, Shen Wanzhao, Shen Wanhe)
Comrades Shen Wanhua, et al.:
　　1. The term "political issues" cannot be used casually and recklessly. In the past, many places mistakenly struggled against middle and poor peasants by randomly using the label of political issues. The Central Bureau has already criticized this practice in its instructions to the Taihang District Party Committee. These people should have their civil rights restored immediately. 2. It is even more wrong that Shen Zonghao was struggled against because his brother had "political issues." His civil rights should be restored immediately. The difficulties in their lives and production must be resolved immediately. If other peasants are facing the same difficulties as them, they should also be given appropriate consideration. But one cannot only take care of one side.

　　Shares of landlords and rich peasants that were confiscated should be returned
Editor：
　　I have read the instructions of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau regarding industrial and commercial policies published on page one of your newspaper on April 29th, and I still have two points that are unclear. Please explain: 1. Are public-run management offices considered commercial enterprises? If so, last year during the elimination of feudalism, the shares and dividends earned by employees of the management office who were struggling households were confiscated by the management office after they were purged. If industrial and commercial policies are implemented, should the shares and dividends be returned to the original owners? 2. Are cooperatives in rural areas considered commercial enterprises? If so, last year during the elimination of feudalism, the stocks of landlords who invested in cooperatives were confiscated. Should these stocks be returned? If they should be returned, who is responsible for returning them? Because the stocks were confiscated by individuals, not by the unified peasant association, and the stocks obtained by the individuals were not within the fruits to be distributed, the peasant association should not be responsible and it cannot be regarded as personal embezzlement (as it was stated at the time). If the individual is asked to return them, they only see their own small interests and their thinking is not clear. Should they be forced to comply?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sun Weifan
Comrade Sun Weifan:
　　1. If the public-run management office is commercial in nature, it should naturally be considered industry and commerce. The shares of the struggling households that were confiscated by the public should be returned. 2. According to the Central Bureau's instructions to Taiyue, the shares of landlords in cooperatives should not be confiscated. Those that have already been confiscated should be returned. If they were confiscated by individuals, they should be resolutely returned. Allowing individuals to confiscate them at will and take them for themselves is completely wrong.

　　Confiscated street vending equipment should be returned
Editor：
　　I live in Xiaoshitou Village, Xingtai Third District. I started as an apprentice at Sanshenghe at the age of fifteen. At the age of twenty-three, I earned eighty yuan in interest and started a stall with my brother in Tongtan. At that time, my family only had forty mu of land (both good and bad). Through my street vending, I gradually acquired another thirty to forty mu over eighteen years. When I left home, my family had ten or so people, and now it has thirteen or fourteen. During the land reform movement the year before last, my family was also struggled against, and we were left with only twenty mu of bad land. However, the land there does not produce grain at all. We can only maintain our livelihood by working hard for others and women doing needlework. My brother is still vending in Tongtan. Last year, during the elimination of feudalism, Tongtan Village also put my brother under control (I participated in shop work before the movement, and I was also squeezed back at that time). After being put under control, the Tongtan Public Office sent a letter to my village, asking us to clear up the goods. Kong Zhaoxuan from my village was responsible for clearing them up. He went to Tongtan and discussed with the village. The goods were worth a total of 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, and they were divided in half. My brother also had five city houses that he bought in Tongtan in 1942, and he also left them in Tongtan. My brother only got a bed and a carrying pole after ten years of hard work. After going back, he picks up firewood all day long. He still carries some loads this year, but he still can't make ends meet. Now that I see in the newspaper that industry and commerce should be returned, should my brother's burden be returned? Because the goods, quilts, and houses in Tongtan have not been divided, they are still stored in that house. Please answer. (Kong Xianjing, Lin Fenghuo Inn, Changzhi)
Comrade Kong Xianjing: Based on your letter, your brother's component should be a small vendor. Small vendors are independent laborers and exploited people. Their interests should be resolutely protected in the land reform and in the new democratic country. It is wrong to struggle against or control small vendors. If the fruits, houses, and goods in Tongtan have not been divided, they should be returned in full immediately. The fruits that your village took back should also be returned. If they have already been distributed, appropriate compensation should be made to enable them to resume business. As for whether your family should be struggled against, it is impossible to say for sure based on the materials you provided. But regardless of whether they should be struggled against, control should be lifted immediately. If they cannot maintain their livelihood, the village should provide necessary resettlement to enable them to carry out production.

    非填补村也应给错斗中农生产资料编辑同志：
    近来报上不断登载改正成份，恢复错斗中农权利，到现在我县（临漳）还未见纠正。这事靠何方面来发动？还是工作组专门负责？还是区里人就算？村中把果实分完了，怎样补偿呢？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　庆蚨庆蚨同志：
    改正错斗中农成份，补偿错斗中农损失，在进行填补地区，由工作组协助新农会处理；没进行填补的地方，可由县区干部负责协助村农会先给以必要的生活及生产资料，解决困难，恢复其公民权，其余损失等填补时再补偿。若果实已经分完，可在贷粮贷款中适当照顾，将来没收征收封建财产或翻身过高者退出多得果实时正式补偿。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者
    错斗中农应即恢复公民权编辑同志：
    我有两个疑难问题，请答复：（一）被误斗了的中农，非等到抽补时才能恢复公民权吗？特别是去年大运动时斗错的很多，有的连中农都不够。都是追三代、估圪堆斗了。他们说：“抽补要二年至三年，咱还不知等到等不到哩。”他们急着想回到农民队伍里来，最好让当地区干部先适当划好阶级，恢复误斗中农公民权，让他们很快和咱站在一起。
    张思恭张思恭同志：
    你的意见是对的，错斗的中农，不但应给以生活资料，还应立即恢复他们的公民权，不能还把这一部分群众当地主富农看待。可由当地区干部负责协助村农会改正所有错斗户成份（但不必全村都划一次阶级），解决他们的困难。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者编者同志：
    邢台七区麦地湾村前年冬群运时，有四户（也不是地主、富农），因政治问题被斗争了，象这些人现在有选举权没有？该村申宗豪是个老实受家，也不是地主富农，因他哥有些政治问题，前年冬也被斗了。现在当下就没吃的。他组群众把这问题圪扯了一下，多数人提到，要是基本群众与他同样困难，可先调剂粮食给基本群众。最后也没有确定。这些户算不算基本群众？（申万华、申万兆、申万河）申万华等同志：
    一、“政治问题”这名词，不能随便乱用，过去不少地方随便用政治问题的帽子，斗了中贫农是错误的。中央局给太行区党委的指示中已经批评了这种作法。这些人现在应立刻恢复他们的公民权。二、申宗豪因为他哥哥有政治问题被斗争，更属不对，应立即恢复他的公民权。他们生活上生产上的困难必须立即给予解决。如果有其他农民与他们同样困难，当然也须适当照顾。但不能光照顾这一边。
    编者
    没收地主富农股金应退还编辑同志：
    我看了贵报四月二十九日一版所登中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于工商业政策的指示，还有两点糊涂，请你们解释一下：一、公家设立的经营处是不是商业？如是的话，去年挤封建中在经营处当职员的人在本处入下股金，赚下红利，因他们是斗争户，被清洗出来，其股金和红利也被经营处没收。如果执行工商业政策，其股金和红利是否该退原主？二、在农村中的合作社是不是商业？如是的话，去年挤封建时，把地主在合作社入股金的股票没收了，是否还要退？如该退的话叫谁负责退？因没收股票是个人没收的，不是农会统一没收，其本人所得股票又不在应分之果实内，当然农会不该负责，还不能按本人贪污论（当时声明过）；如叫本人退，他只看到自己的小利益，思想不通，是否就该服从了他？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　孙维藩孙维藩同志：
    一、公家设立的经营处，若系商业性质，自然应算做工商业。公家没收的被斗户股金应该退还。二、根据中央局给太岳的指示，地主在合作社里的股金是不应没收的，已经没收的应该退还。若是个人没收，更应坚决退还。让其个人随便没收，据为己有，是完全错误的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    摆小摊被没收应该退还编辑同志：
    吾家住邢台三区小石头庄村，自十五岁出门到三盛和学生意，到二十三岁自己找了八十元利息，与吾兄到桐滩摆摊，那时吾家只有四十来亩地（连好带坏），经过吾摆摊赶集，十八年当中自己慢慢的又置了三四十亩。我出门时家有十来口人，到现在有十三四口。前年土改运动时，吾家也被斗了，还留下有廿亩坏地，可是吾们那里的地根本不打粮食，只凭与人家受苦，妇女做活维持生活，吾兄还是在桐滩摆摊。去年挤封建时，桐滩村把吾兄也管理起来了（吾运动前参加商店工作，到那时吾也挤回去了）。被管后，桐滩公所与吾村去信，叫上去清理，吾村孔照选负责去清理，到桐滩与村上共同讨论，货物一共值十五六万元，各分一半，还有吾兄在那里四二年买下市房五间，也与桐滩放下了。吾兄经过十年辛苦，只落下一个铺的、一根扁担，拿回去了。回去后整天拾柴，今年还不断的担些脚，但仍是赶不了嘴。现在看见报纸上说得要退工商业，象我兄的这个担子，是不是该退？因为桐滩的东西与货、被子、房子都没有分了，还在那个房子存放。请答复。（长治林凤货栈内孔宪敬）
    孔宪敬同志：就来信看，你哥哥的成份应是小商贩。小商贩是独立劳动者与被剥削者，他们的利益在土改中和新民主国家中，应受到坚决保护。斗争或管制小商贩是错误的，假如桐滩的果实房屋货物还未分，应立即如数退还，你村拿回的果实也同样应该退还，若已分散，则应作适当补偿，使其能恢复营业。至于你家庭是否该斗，就来信所谈材料，尚无法肯定。但不管是否该斗，管制应立即取消。生活无法维持时，村中应给以必要安置，使有可能进行生产。——编者
