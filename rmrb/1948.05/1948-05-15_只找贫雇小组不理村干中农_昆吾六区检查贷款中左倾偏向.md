    Focusing Only on Poor and Hired Peasant Groups, Ignoring Village Cadres and Middle Peasants:
    Left-Leaning Deviation in Loan Inspection in the Sixth District of Kunwu
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] The Sixth District of Kunwu inspected the disaster relief loan work and summarized three problems: (1) Two different approaches were adopted in the loan process, resulting in completely different outcomes: One approach involved village cadres investigating the actual difficulties of the poor masses, while district cadres went deep into the masses to individually consult with core poor peasants. After the investigation and consultation matured, a meeting of middle and poor peasants was held to explain the spirit of the loans. During the explanation, attention was paid to avoiding the suggestion of "first lending to poor peasants, then to middle peasants, and finally to landlords," to prevent isolating the poor peasants from the middle peasants. It was advocated to compare who was the most miserable and who could get the loan. Then, loan recipients were discussed in groups, and the loan recipients discussed by each group were announced to everyone for final decision-making. The loan amount was self-reported and publicly agreed upon. The other approach was that after the district cadres arrived in the village, they did not conduct in-depth investigations, but only spoke a few words with individual village cadres and then convened a peasant meeting, asking everyone to self-report and publicly agree. For example, in Yan Village, because the district cadres had a poor understanding of the situation and did not consult beforehand, the village initially wanted to borrow one million yuan, but the meeting self-reported five million yuan. Later, after in-depth work, it took a lot of effort to lend out, and a total of twenty-seven households borrowed 970,000 yuan, which caused dissatisfaction among some people, who said that the cadres were not telling the truth. (2) The district as a whole loaned five million yuan. The district originally planned to only lend to five or six severely affected villages. During the district cadre meeting, some people disagreed, believing that if they did not specifically understand the situation and subjectively concentrated the loans too much in key villages while ignoring general villages, it would allow many undeserving households in the key villages to receive loans, while truly poor households in other villages would not receive loans. Finally, it was decided to expand the loan scope to a total of eleven villages. In order to truly solve the difficulties of the poor peasants, the number of loan recipients in each village should be reduced, and the money should be lent to the most difficult people. (3) There was also a serious left-leaning deviation in the loan process. Some comrades who had undergone party rectification believed that all the past work was wrong and were not bold in their work. Comrades who had not undergone party rectification were also not bold under these influences. In short, many comrades had the mistaken idea of seeking to avoid mistakes rather than seeking merit. During the loan process, they only learned about the situation from poor peasant groups, and did not care about village cadres and middle peasants, believing that the old village cadres were all bad and completely unreliable. The village cadres also failed to correctly understand the spirit of party rectification and were afraid of being criticized in the future, which also caused problems in the work.

    (Editor's note: The correct approach in loaning is to truly lend to poor and hired peasants and middle peasants who have difficulties in production, and the distribution should be self-reported, publicly discussed, and discussed by the masses.)

### 只找贫雇小组不理村干中农  昆吾六区检查贷款中左倾偏向

    只找贫雇小组不理村干中农
    昆吾六区检查贷款中左倾偏向
    【冀鲁豫消息】昆吾六区检查救灾贷款工作，总结出三个问题：（一）在贷款中采取了两种不同的作法，得到完全不同的结果：一种作法是一面布置村干部调查贫苦群众的实际困难情况，一面由区干部深入群众，掌握贫农骨干个别酝酿，等调查酝酿成熟时再开中贫农大会，讲解贷款精神。在讲解中注意到不提先贷贫农二贷中农三贷地主，以免使贫农孤立脱离中农，提倡比苦谁最苦谁可贷，然后分组讨论贷款户，再把各小组讨论的贷款户统一宣布，让大家讨论做最后决定，贷款数目是自报公议。另一种作法是区干到村后不深入了解，只和个别村干谈几句话就召开农民大会，叫大家自报公议。如阎庄因为区干了解情况差，事前没酝酿，本来要贷给这村一百万款，大会自报了五百万元，后来又经过深入工作，费了很大力气才贷下去，共二十七户贷了九十七万元，引起一些人不满，说干部不说实话。（二）全区共贷款五百万元，区里原打算只贷五、六个重灾村，开区干会讨论时，有些人不同意，认为如不具体了解情况，凭主观想象把贷款过多的集中在重点村而忽视了一般村，会使重点村好多不该贷款的户也贷了款，而在其他村真正贫苦的户贷不到。最后决定扩大贷款范围共十一个村。为了真正解决贫苦农民的困难，各村贷款户要减少，要把款子贷到最困难人们的手里。（三）在贷款中还存在着严重的左倾偏向。一部分经过整党的同志，认为过去的工作全部错了，对工作不大胆，没整过党的同志在这些影响下，也是不大胆。总之，许多同志存在着不求有功但求无过的错误思想，在贷款中专从贫农小组里了解情况，对村干和中农不管不问，认为老村干都是坏的，全不可靠，村干又未能正确了解整党精神，怕将来挨整，这样也使工作发生毛病。
    （编者按：贷款中正确作法是真正贷到贫苦和生产有困难的贫雇中农手里，分配应是自报公议群众讨论。）
