Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Under the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the Zaozhuang mining area in southern Shandong has become a living hell. Since Chiang Kai-shek's bandits reoccupied Zaozhuang last November, most of the original 240 small kilns were destroyed by the bandits, and only about 50 small kilns have been put into operation, accommodating only 2,000 workers. The remaining 13,000 workers are displaced and begging everywhere. Yang, a worker in Xitou, unable to survive, secretly put poison in the food while eating, poisoning his wife and two sons, and then hanged himself in the mine kiln. A tragic incident occurred in Shimiao Street where seven people in one house starved to death at the same time. Selling children has become commonplace, and children are becoming less and less valuable. A seven-year-old child of Hou in Nanzhaofang was sold for only 800,000 Chiang coins. The 2,000 miners still employed are also in dire straits under the layers of exploitation by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Their daily wages are only enough to buy a little over a catty of sorghum pancakes, but they still have to pay monthly "trade union" dues, military expenses, flag fees, consolation fees, and New Year's fees. Mine safety equipment has been completely abandoned. Mine shafts often collapse. On the night of April 20th, rainwater poured into two kiln openings, drowning 24 workers at once. Thugs and special agents holding weapons are even more rampant, robbing day and night. Twelve households were robbed in Sujiayuan in one night. One miner sold his child during the day and exchanged it for thirty catties of grain, which was also snatched by them. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits also colluded with seventeen profiteers headed by Li Chuntian to manipulate grain. When grain prices soared, the bandits lent the corn and soybean cakes they had plundered at usurious rates, cruelly exploiting workers and citizens. The Zaozhuang workers are eagerly looking forward to the return of the People's Liberation Army.

    在蒋匪血腥统治下枣庄矿工讨吃度日
    【新华社华东十三日电】在蒋匪血腥统治下的鲁南枣庄矿区，已成人间地狱。去年十一月蒋匪重占枣庄后，原二百四十多个小窑，因多为蒋匪破坏，仅于五十余小窑开工，只能容纳二千工人。其余一万三千余工人流离失所，到处行乞。西头一工人杨某，因无法过活，在吃饭时偷偷渗入毒药，将老婆和两个儿子毒死，自己也在矿窑上吊而死。石庙街曾发生一屋七人同时饿死的惨剧。卖儿鬻女更为常事，小孩越来越不值钱。南赵房侯某一个七岁的孩童只卖了八十万蒋币。两千在业矿工，在蒋匪层层压榨下亦陷绝境。他们每日的工资仅够买一斤多高粱煎饼，但每月尚须缴纳“工会”会费、军工费、旗子费、抚血费、过年费等。矿窑安全设备，已全告废弛，窑井常常倒塌，四月二十日夜雨水冲入两个窑口，一次即溺毙工人二十四名。持有武器之匪特，更横行无忌，日夜抢劫，苏家园一夜曾被抢十二户，有一矿工白天卖了孩子换得三十斤粮食，也为他们抢去。蒋匪更勾结以李春田为首的十七家奸商操纵粮食，在粮价暴涨时，蒋匪即以抢来的包米、豆饼大放高利贷，一斗高粱还一斗面，残酷的剥削着工人和市民。枣庄工人正在殷切盼望人民解放军的回来。
