　　【This Newspaper News】After two and a half months of the democratic party rectification and replenishment movement in Zhao Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, a rural democratic life has been gradually established. At the beginning of the democratic party rectification, it was clearly announced that party members and cadres had no privileges. It was explained that party members and cadres should humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and no retaliation was allowed. The leadership resolutely guaranteed the democratic rights of the masses such as freedom of speech. During the movement, the class status of wrongly criticized households in the past was corrected, the label of "special agent" was removed, and the civil rights of this group of people were officially restored. The working group also emphasized that in the future, no one could arbitrarily label others as special agents. Those with real and conclusive evidence had to be sent to higher-level governments for interrogation and handling. No feudal rule methods such as detention and hanging were allowed. Party member cadres openly conducted self-criticism among the masses, admitting their mistakes. If the responsibility should be borne by the higher-level, the working group would make a self-criticism on its behalf, clarifying responsibilities and distinguishing right from wrong, so that the masses could realize that under a truly democratic system, no one would be wronged, and they would dare to stand up and be masters of their own affairs. Throughout the movement, attention was paid to establishing normal meeting life and organizational life, breaking the long-standing formalism of democracy in the past. It was emphasized that in the future, everyone should express their own opinions, without fear of retaliation, and there was no need for a few people to speak on behalf of others. At the same time, in action (especially in class division and election of cadres), efforts were made to maintain the isolated opinions of the minority, explaining that the minority should obey the majority, but the minority had the right to reserve their own opinions, so that the masses dared to boldly express and adhere to their own opinions, avoiding blindly agreeing with everyone.
　　
Various Organizations are Discussed and Used by the Masses Themselves
Whenever an organization was established, the structure, responsibilities, and relationship with other organizations were also discussed and decided by the masses. Only after they had a clear understanding themselves could they use it correctly. For example, when the Peasants' Representative Assembly was established, the masses were asked to discuss why there should be such an organization. As a result, everyone believed that the village cadres were like the managers of a cooperative, and the Peasants' Representative Assembly was like the representatives of the shareholders of the cooperative. Because the village was large and it was not easy for the shareholders to hold meetings, the shareholder representatives would represent everyone to regularly assign work to the managers, check the accounts, reward them if they did well, criticize them if they did wrong, and even replace them. The members of each organization also studied and clarified their own identity and tasks. For example, after the Poor Peasants' League made a resolution, the members would go to the Peasants' Representative Assembly group and the Peasants' Association group to publicize and explain it. If it didn't work, they would hold a meeting to check where the problem was. When necessary, the Poor Peasants' League also absorbed upright middle peasants to participate in the meeting. When electing village government members, some groups emphasized good speaking skills, writing skills, and accounting skills when proposing candidates, forgetting the basic conditions such as long-term labor and selflessness. The Poor Peasants' League immediately invited upright middle peasants to hold a meeting to discuss and carefully consider, and everyone voluntarily proposed others based on the conditions, ensuring the successful completion of the election.
　　
In the subsequent replenishment, Zhao Village mainly relied on the Peasants' Representative Assembly to promote democracy and represent public opinion. Land measurement, output assessment, and even the assessment and decision of supplementary levy plans were all discussed and resolved by the Peasants' Representative Assembly. After the three lists were finalized and announced, the Agricultural Committee, the Poor Peasants' Committee, and the village government respectively led the implementation. Various administrative tasks, such as providing corvée labor, paying burdens, and making military shoes, were studied by the Village Political Committee, and then the responsible committee members put forward principles and plans, which were then executed after being approved by the Peasants' Representative Assembly. This not only passed through the masses, but also ensured the rapid completion of tasks. The village cadres also felt that with the Peasants' Representative Assembly, someone was in charge, and the work was easier to do.
　　
The Disadvantage is that the Peasants' Representative Assembly Replaced the Work of the Agricultural Committee
However, in this supplementary levy, the use of the Peasants' Representative Assembly was not clear and proficient enough. The Peasants' Representative Assembly often met, forming a situation where the representatives worked collectively, and the work of the Agricultural Committee was reduced instead, failing to fully exert the representativeness of the Peasants' Representative Assembly. A small number of representatives became bureaucratic and alienated from the masses. This was mainly due to the fact that the Peasants' Association did not have groups, and the representatives' residential groups were unified with the Peasants' Association groups. In this way, the work of the Peasants' Association group was also placed on the shoulders of the representatives, which not only increased the burden on the representatives, but also lacked supervision over the representatives. The representatives did not convene residential group meetings, and the members of the Peasants' Association could not fully exercise democracy. In the process of supplementary levy, at first, the representatives missed some individual requests from the poor and hired peasants, and did not bring them all to the Peasants' Representative Assembly. Some masses were dissatisfied, appealed to higher levels, or complained behind their backs. The organized democratic life was not sound enough, which was the root cause of this. Secondly, in a large village like Zhao Village, the number of members of the Agricultural Committee should be increased. Thirteen members cannot well concentrate and study the opinions of the masses, and cannot well realize the role of a permanent agency. Although the form of joint office of the Agricultural Committee and the Poor Peasants' Committee was adopted, the use of the Peasants' Representative Assembly was not clear and proficient enough, and this shortcoming was still not quickly corrected. After a democratic inspection and summary of this stage of work, a few responsible comrades of the Peasants' Association were much clearer than before.

　　赵庄建立民主生活的点滴经验
    【本报消息】武安九区赵庄经过两个半月的民主整党填补运动，逐步建立了乡村民主生活。民主整党一开始，就明确宣布党员干部没有任何特权，说明党员干部应虚心倾听群众意见，不许打击报复，领导上坚决保障群众言论自由等民主权利。在运动中，订正了过去错斗户的成份，摘掉特务帽，正式恢复了这一部分人的公民权。工作组并强调声明，今后任何人不能随便给人戴特务帽子，真正有确凿证据的也得送交上级政府审讯处理，不能随便采取扣押吊打等封建统治办法。并由干部党员在群众中公开进行自我批评，承认错误。责任应由上级负的，则由工作组代作检讨，分清责任，弄清是非，使群众体会到在真正民主的制度下，任何人都不会受屈，而敢于起来当家主事。在整个运动过程中，注意建立正常的会议生活与组织生活，打破过去长时期的形式主义的民主。强调以后各人有意见各人发表，不怕打击报复，也用不着少数人代替别人讲。同时在行动中（特别是在划阶级、选举干部中），有意识地维护少数孤立的意见，说明少数应该服从多数，但少数人有保留自己意见的权利，使群众敢于大胆发表并坚持自己的意见，避免盲目地附和大家。
    各种组织均由群众自己讨论运用
    每当成立一个组织时，这个组织的机构、职责，与别的组织关系等问题，也都交由群众讨论决定。他们自己先认识清楚以后，就能正确地运用。例如成立农代会时，让群众讨论为啥要有这个组织，结果大家认为村干部好比合作社掌柜，农代会好比合作社的股东代表，因为村大，股东开会不容易，股东代表就代表大家经常给掌柜布置工作，检查帐目，好了奖励他，错了批评他，甚至撤换他。各个组织中的成员对自己的身份和任务，也都经过研究，弄得很清楚。例如贫农团有了决议，由团员们分别到农代会小组与农会小组里宣传解释，行不通就开会检查，看毛病在哪里。必要时，贫农团开会也吸收正派中农参加。选村政府委员时，有些小组提候选人看重了能说会道、能写会算，而把长年劳动大公无私等基本条件忘掉了，贫农团即邀请正派中农一块开会研究，慎重考虑，由大家根据条件，自愿另提别人，保证了选举的完满。
    在后来的填补中，赵庄主要依靠农代会发扬民主、代表民意。丈地、评产量，以至评议决定抽补等计划，都经农代会讨论决议，三榜定案公布后，交农委会、贫委会及村政府分别领导执行。各种行政工作，如支差、交负担、做军鞋，则由村政委员会研究后，分别交各该负责委员提出方针原则和计划，经农代会通过而后执行。既通过了群众，又保证了很快完成任务。村干部们也觉得有了农代会就有人当家，工作也好办了。
    缺点是农代会代替了农委会工作
    但在这次抽补中，农代会的运用还不够明确熟练。农代会经常集会，形成了代表集体办公，农委会的工作反而减轻，没有充分发挥农代会的代表性。一小部分代表产生了官僚化，脱离群众的现象，这主要是由于农会没有小组，把代表的居民组与农会小组统一起来的结果。这样，农会小组的工作也放在代表肩上，不但加重了代表的负担，而且对代表也缺乏监督。代表不召集居民小组会，农会会员便不能充分运用民主。在抽补过程中，起初代表有些遗漏了个别贫雇要求，没全带到农代会上去，有的群众不满，越级上诉，或背后瞒怨，有组织的民主生活还不够健全，就是基源于此。其次，象赵庄这样大村，农委会的人数应该加多，十三个委员是不能很好集中与研究群众意见，不能很好实现常驻机关的作用的，虽然采取了农委会、贫委会联合办公的形式，但对农代会的运用不够明确熟练，仍没有很快的纠正这一缺点。经过民主检查总结这一阶段的工作后，少数农会负责同志才较前明确多了。
