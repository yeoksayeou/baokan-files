[Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] The Changyuan County Party Committee is actively leading production to overcome the famine, resolutely correcting the "leftist" erroneous actions of damaging middle peasants and乱斗 (luàn dòu - chaotic struggle sessions) village cadres. According to a letter from the County Party Committee on April 24, during the first phase of Party rectification, the cadres left behind in the old areas of the eighth, ninth, and tenth districts, after reading the Central Committee's instructions on the work in the old and semi-old areas published in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, did not truly grasp the spirit of it. They convened group leader meetings at the district level to discuss and decide on organizing poor peasant groups, and immediately took action after the meeting. For example, the South Group of the Ninth District held a village cadre meeting, stipulating that poor peasant groups be organized within five days. Some poor peasant groups were controlled by former ousted village cadres, while others were controlled by current village cadres; it can be said that truly pure and honest poor peasants had no control. The former type of poor peasant group had great enthusiasm for opposing incumbent village cadres. In the whole county, eleven villages had carried out or were preparing to carry out activities against village cadres. The latter type had great enthusiasm for struggling against middle peasants. Twenty-two villages had already struggled against or were preparing to struggle against middle peasants, and middle peasant cadres were very panicked. When the Party rectification cadres returned and promoted the policies, they were somewhat cold towards the village cadres, making them even more panicked. For example, Jing Wenbing, the director of the farmers' association in Jingzhai Village, Ninth District, cried several times out of fear, while others became antagonistic to the masses. Xishaozhai Village organized a poor peasant group of more than 200 people, but the real power was in the hands of several ousted village cadres. Headed by Li Wanyong, a seven-member accounting committee was formed, creating a sharp confrontation between the incumbent village cadres and the poor peasant group. Based on these circumstances, the County Party Committee felt that it was necessary to quickly stabilize social order, so that cadres and the masses could shift to production and frugality to overcome the famine. Therefore, it convened joint meetings of village cadres at the sub-district level, explaining the spirit of Party rectification, pointing out that as long as they were enthusiastic about serving the masses, the masses would forgive them, and pointing out the future for the village cadres. The village cadres began to stabilize somewhat. At the same time, it educated the masses not to be fooled by a small number of ambitious elements, and guided the masses to obtain loans, borrow fruits, and engage in production and frugality to overcome the famine. The County Party Committee prepared to further propose, at the district level, to resolutely compensate the middle peasants who had been struggled against, and to strictly prohibit any further damage to the interests of middle peasants. As of April 24, most of the village cadres and masses who had obtained loans were focused on production. In Cao's six households in the Tenth District who received loans, they weaved mats at night and went to the market during the day to buy sorghum stalks, earning 2,000 yuan per person per day. Some loan recipients transported grain for business, and the atmosphere of production was rising.

    长垣开始制止混乱
    冀鲁豫各地都应做检查
    【冀鲁豫消息】长垣县委积极领导生产渡荒，坚决纠正损害中农乱斗村干的左倾错误行动。据县委会四月二十四日来信称：在第一期整党时，八、九、十三个老区留在家里的干部，看到冀鲁豫日报登的中央对老区半老区工作指示后，没有真正领会其中的精神，就以区为单位召开组长会议，讨论并决议组织贫农组，会后立刻行动起来。如九区南组召开村干会，规定五天组织好贫农组，有的贫农组被过去下台的村干所掌握，有的被现任村干所掌握，真正纯正老实的贫农掌握的可说没有。前一种贫农组，反当权村干的劲头很大，全县有十一个村进行了和准备进行反村干的活动。后一种斗中农的劲头很大，已斗争和准备斗争中农的有二十二个村，中农村干都很恐慌。到整党干部回来后宣传政策时，对村干又有些冷淡，村干更恐慌起来。如九区敬砦村农会主任敬文炳，吓的哭了几场，有的则和群众对立起来。西邵砦村组织了二百余人的贫农组，实际掌握大权的是几个下台村干。以李万永为首，组成七人算帐委员会，形成了当权村干和贫农组的尖锐对立。根据这些情况，县委感到必须迅速安定社会秩序，使干部群众都转到生产节约渡荒，于是便以小区为单位召开村干联席会，讲明整党精神，只要热心为群众服务，群众会原谅自己的，给村干指出了前途，村干开始有些稳定。同时教育群众不要上了少数野心分子的当，引导群众到贷款借果实生产节约渡荒方面来。县委会准备以区为单位并进一步提出对被斗中农坚决补偿，一律不许再损害中农利益。至四月二十四日，一部分贷到款的村干群众，多数都专心从事生产了。十区曹家六户贷款的，黑夜编席白天上集买秫秸，每天每人编两领可赚两千元，有的贷款户则运输粮食做买卖，生产空气上升。
