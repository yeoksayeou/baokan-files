◇ In Jidong, five counties including Leting and Luannan have sown 632,000 mu of spring and autumn wheat. They are now actively preparing to plant 50,000 mu of cotton, striving to produce 50 million jin of cotton to solve the needs of the military and the people.

◇ Public security bureaus in various counties of Jidong actively organize prisoners to engage in production, transforming and educating them through labor, and reducing expenses. According to statistics from counties such as Pinggu, the profits earned in the past six months have reached 97,755 jin of millet. Public security personnel in Ji County are engaged in production together with the prisoners. Since March, they have solved the food and spring clothing needs of all prisoners. Qian'an County also organized prisoners to help the masses in Xingcheng with more than 1,500 workdays.

◇ The Beiyue Quyang County Production Promotion Agency used "cotton loans in exchange for cloth," lending out a total of 60,000 jin of cotton. More than 39,000 spinning wheels and 7,000 looms are operating throughout the county. It is estimated that 4,500 to 5,000 shi of rice can be earned within two months.

◇ The Pingshan County Production Promotion Agency has allocated 275 million yuan as production promotion funds. It was decided to issue 50 million yuan in agricultural loans and 133,000 jin of millet. 20 million yuan was used to purchase draft animals from Shanxi and sell them directly to users at prices lower than the market price. 50 million yuan was used to open farm implement manufacturing plants and iron factories, etc. The farm implement factory has already started production and plans to transport local cloth to Shanxi for sale, exchanging it for livestock, black and red alum, for insect prevention, pest control, and soil fertilization.

◇ The Yangwu River in Lan County is known as "Yangwu flows with gold, enriching thousands of villages." In the past, due to harassment by the Yan bandit gang, the channels were silted up, the canal mouths were damaged, and irrigation was greatly affected. After the land reform, local farmers established the Yangwu Water Conservancy Construction Administration Bureau, and last winter they re-dredged the main and branch canals, increasing the area irrigated by one times compared to the past. Now, they are building seven canals in villages such as Jiatuo Village and Weijiazhuang Village, which are expected to increase the irrigated land by more than 200 qing. Furthermore, a meeting of representatives from 32 water conservancy villages was held to stipulate water use time according to the land area of each village, overcoming past water use disputes and chaotic waste.
