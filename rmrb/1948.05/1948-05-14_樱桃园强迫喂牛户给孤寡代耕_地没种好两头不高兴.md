(Jilu Yu News) In the Cherry Orchard area of the Fourth District of Fan County, cadres forced households that fed cattle to farm land for the solitary and widowed, causing losses for middle peasants and delaying production for the solitary and widowed. When the district cadres convened a meeting of the solitary and widowed in the Cherry Orchard area and asked them to raise their difficulties, they said, "We have no one to farm the land; assign it to the groups to farm for us." The district cadres then instructed the village cadres to call all the cattle-feeding households (mostly middle peasants) from separate streets to a meeting and order them to farm for the solitary and widowed. The cattle-feeding households said they couldn't farm for free and would need fodder. The district cadres explained, "The solitary and widowed can't afford it." The middle peasants outwardly agreed to farm the land, but after the meeting, they were unenthusiastic and procrastinated. In the back street, there was a widow named Cui Wangshi, who lived alone and had four mu of land (a little more than one mu of spring land). Previously, her son-in-law (from the same village) had farmed the land for her. After the forced farming meeting, which stipulated that each street should take care of its own, her son-in-law no longer took care of it. Her land was assigned to Cui Yuanshan, a relative, to farm, but Cui Yuanshan was very unhappy. He kept delaying for more than ten days, not plowing the land or spreading manure. He demanded that Cui Wangshi pay him 4,800 yuan for the livestock's legs, plus 300 jin of wheat straw, one dou of feed per month, and all the broken straw, chaff, bean skins, and other scraps should also go to the livestock (he didn't want to farm for her and deliberately asked for a high price). Cui Wangshi couldn't afford it and complained to the cadres. She told the district cadres, "In previous years, my son-in-law did the work and did it so timely! Since this method was introduced, my son-in-law can push it away and I can't stop him, and the land still hasn't been plowed. I really don't know what to do." The district cadres then asked the village cadre, Cui Youhuai, to find a solution. Cui Youhuai became anxious and personally pushed six small carts of manure to her field with Cui Yanhai and also asked elementary school students to hoe the land for half a day. Cui Wangshi was still unhappy and told the district cadres, "The children are hoeing the land, and it's too late to harrow it. The ground is full of clods." Because of the forced farming, the middle peasants who had cattle also lacked motivation to work, feeling that after they finished their own work, they would have to do work for others anyway, so they just "dragged their feet." In the west back street, a middle peasant named Ma Zihe, who was almost finished plowing his own land, was afraid of having to work for others, so he dawdled in the field. He smoked a pipe at the south end after plowing, and he smoked a pipe at the north end after plowing. Some people continued to use the cattle to grind fine flour loosely and without urgency.

    樱桃园强迫喂牛户给孤寡代耕
    地没种好两头不高兴
    【冀鲁豫消息】范县四区樱桃园区干部强迫代耕，使中农吃亏，孤寡也耽误了生产。当区干在樱桃园召集孤寡开会，叫提困难时，她们说：“俺没人种地，划到组里给俺种吧。”区干部就让村干分开街把喂牛户都叫在一堆（多是中农），叫他们给孤寡代耕。喂牛户说不能白种，得给草料。区干解释说：“孤寡拿不起。”中农表面答应代耕，散了会都不带劲，向后推。后街有一家寡妇叫崔王氏，一口人，四亩地（一亩多春地），先前是她女婿（本村人）给她种地，开了代耕会，规定各街照顾各街后，她女婿就不管了。她的地分给本家崔元山给种，可是崔元山心里很不痛快，一直推了十来天，地没犁，粪没拉，非叫崔王氏拿四千八百元牲口腿，再拿三百斤麦秸，一个月一斗料，麦秸糠，豆皮等碎草也得归牲口（他不愿给她种，故意要个大价）；崔王氏给不起，就埋怨起干部来。她向区干部说：“年时俺女婿给做活，做的多应时！一兴这法，俺女婿能推不能拦，地这时还没犁，俺真没法。”区干部又叫村干崔有怀给想法。崔有怀急了，亲自和崔彦海给她把六小车粪推到地里，又叫小学生给她刨了一晌地。崔王氏还不乐意，对区干部说：“小孩刨地，耙的晚了，满地是坷垃”。因为强迫代耕，有牛的中农做活也没劲，觉得自己做完后反正得给人家做，就光“磨洋工”。西后街有一家中农叫马子合，自己快犁完了，怕给别人做活，就在地里死拖。犁到南头吸袋烟，犁到北头也吸袋烟。有的照常使牛磨细面，松松地，不上紧。
