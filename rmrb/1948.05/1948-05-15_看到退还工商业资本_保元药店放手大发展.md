    Seeing the Return of Industrial and Commercial Capital
    Baoyuan Pharmacy Lets Go for Great Development
    [Taihang News] After learning about the democratic government's policy of resolutely protecting and supporting industry and commerce, the "Baoyuan Pharmacy" in Changzhi City dispelled its worries about "being struggled against if it grew too large," expanded its capital, and developed its business. The pharmacy was originally a very small shop. After Changzhi was liberated in 1945, it moved from Lucheng to Changzhi City and set up a small drug stall. At that time, under the government's policy of encouraging the development of industry and commerce, it achieved rapid development. In 1946, its capital expanded to more than 2 million yuan. After the anti-traitor and liquidation campaign began, Manager Miao of the pharmacy was afraid of being struggled against and wanted to merge with a public store as a backer. He put his shares into the Lu'an General Cooperative and changed the name to "Lu'an General Cooperative Baoyuan Pharmacy." However, he remained cautious and did not dare to operate freely. Even when he received some dividends, he always felt that having too much money was a curse. He once donated several hundred thousand yuan to support the front lines, which seemed enlightened on the surface, but was actually out of fear. When the West Street Store Employees' Union held a symposium for managers and employees, the employees made suggestions to him, leading to a struggle session. Some people even mistakenly claimed that he was exploiting people by doing business. This frightened him so much that he stopped doing anything and even thought about committing suicide. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, which stipulated the protection of industry and commerce, he felt slightly relieved. Later, the Lu'an General Cooperative closed down and transferred the pharmacy to him, with a total capital of more than 20 million yuan. He then recruited more than 10 million yuan in shares from the masses. At this time, he was still somewhat skeptical about the policy. It was not until he read in the newspaper that industrial and commercial enterprises would be resolutely protected and that those who had been wrongly struggled against would be compensated that he dared to operate boldly. In one month, he made 20 million yuan in turnover, with a net profit of 6-7 million yuan in silver dollars. Due to the development of the business, he recently added three more staff members. He is very busy every day and does not go to sleep until after 12 o'clock at night. The current circulating capital is frequently above 30 million yuan. He said excitedly: "In the past, I was afraid and didn't dare to do anything. Now I understand the government's policy and want to continue to develop and do business well to prosper our liberated area market."

    看到退还工商业资本
    保元药店放手大发展
    【太行消息】长治市“保元药店”在了解了民主政府坚决保护扶持工商业政策后，解除了“怕发展大了挨斗争”的顾虑，扩大资本，发展业务。该药店原是一座很小的店铺，一九四五年长治解放后，从潞城搬到长市，摆一小药摊，当时在政府奖励发展工商业的政策下，得到飞跃发展。一九四六年资金扩大到二百余万元。反奸清算开始后，该店苗经理害怕斗争，想找个公家商店合并起来，作为靠山，便把他的股金入到潞安总社，字号改为“潞安总社保元药庄”。但他始终小心翼翼，不敢放手经营。得到些红利，也总觉得钱多是害，曾拿出几十万元支援前线，表面看是开明，实际是害怕。西街店员职工会召开经理店员座谈会时，店员向他提意见，形成了斗争会。还有些人错误的提出他做生意是剥削人。这一下把他吓坏了，啥也不干了，甚至要想寻死。土地法大纲公布后，规定着要保护工商业，他才稍放了些心。以后潞安总社结束，把药店转给他，共二千余万元资金，他又招收了群众股金千余万元，这时对政策还是有些怀疑。直到报上登出坚决保护工商业，错斗了的还要退还时，他才大胆的经营开了。一个月即做了两千万元流水，可净赚洋六、七百万元。由于业务的发展，又于最近增添伙计三人，每天生意很多，夜间到十二点钟后才能睡觉，现流动金经常在三千万元以上。他很兴奋的说：“往年害怕不敢干，现在我了解了政府的政策，要不断发展，好好闹生意，来繁荣咱解放区市场。”
