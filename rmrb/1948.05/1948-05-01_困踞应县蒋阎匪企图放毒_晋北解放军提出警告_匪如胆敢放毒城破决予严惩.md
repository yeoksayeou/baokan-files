Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 29th—A spokesman for the Jinbei Front Command of the People's Liberation Army recently exposed the Kuomintang Central News Agency's May 24th fabrication and slander that our army "used smoke and poisonous gas shells." According to documents seized from the enemy, the enemy's dissemination of this rumor is clearly a pre-arranged plan by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops trapped in Ying County to carry out the atrocity of releasing poison gas against our army, just as the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops in Linfen did. The spokesman hereby issues a serious warning to the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops in Ying County: if the bandit troops dare to violate international law and release poison gas, our army will severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit officers who commanded the poisoning on the day the city is captured. The spokesman also requested that our army on the front line in Ying County raise its vigilance a hundredfold against this poisoning plot by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandits.

　　困踞应县蒋阎匪企图放毒
    晋北解放军提出警告
  　匪如胆敢放毒城破决予严惩
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十九日电】解放军晋北前线指挥部发言人，顷揭发中央社二十四日造谣诬指我军“施放烟幕毒气弹”之阴谋称：根据我方缴获匪方文件，匪方散播此项谣言，显系困踞应县城之蒋阎匪军，按其预定计划，为向我军施放毒气的暴行预作布置，一如临汾蒋阎匪军之所为。发言人为此特向应县蒋阎匪军提出严重警告，如匪军胆敢违反国际公法施放毒气，本军决于攻克该城之日，对指挥放毒之蒋阎匪军官，严予惩办。发言人并要求应县前线我军对蒋阎匪此一放毒阴谋，提高百倍警惕。
