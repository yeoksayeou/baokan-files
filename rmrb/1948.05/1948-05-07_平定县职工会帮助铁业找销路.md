　　[Taihang News] The Pingding County Trade Union is leading iron workers in production to overcome the famine. Pingding produces a significant amount of iron, and a large portion of the population relies on iron furnaces for their livelihood. In villages such as Ning'ai, Libi, Xiyu, and Chenjiazhuang, one-third of the population depends on the iron industry for their living. In villages like Qianhousuohuang, Donggou, and Chengguan, each person has an average of only slightly more than nine fen of land, and two-thirds of their livelihood comes from the iron industry. However, due to insufficient attention to the iron industry in the past by leaders, the issue of sales channels was not resolved, leading to the unemployment of a large number of workers. The masses said, "We were not afraid of the famine in 1943 because the iron industry could rely on the railway to transport and sell goods outside in exchange for rice. But this year, we are terrified: if the iron furnaces can't operate, we will starve to death." They sought help from the Trade Union. The Trade Union then assigned Comrade Wang Mantang to focus solely on workers' affairs, not participating in party rectification and replenishment, but dedicated to finding sales channels for the iron industry and working with workers to improve ironmaking techniques and enhance quality. In Houxiyu, they found an elderly merchant named Huo Zizhong, who had experience in the iron industry. He first secured a large number of sales for "yanggun" (iron bars), securing two months of work, organizing 44 furnaces and providing employment for 220 workers. Subsequently, they found sales channels for sickle and scissor iron, with Chenjiazhuang alone selling 80,000 jin. They also helped Libi sell 700 stored iron hoes, and Xiyu and other villages sell more than 830,000 jin of plowshares. This resolved the difficulties for a significant portion of the workers.

　　平定县职工会帮助铁业找销路
    【太行消息】平定县职工会领导铁业工人生产渡荒。平定产铁较多，有一大部分群众依靠铁炉维持生活。宁爱、立壁、西峪、陈家庄等村，群众靠铁业生活的有三分之一。前后锁簧、东沟、城关等村，每人只平均九分多地，生活三分之二靠铁业。但因过去领导上对铁业注意不够，销路问题没解决，大部工人失业。群众说：“四三年灾荒咱不怕，铁行靠铁路能运到外面出卖换来米，今年可害怕啦：铁炉开不了，非饿死不行”。他们找职工会想办法。职工会便抽出王满堂同志专做工人工作，不参加整党填补，专寻找铁行销路，并同工人研究改进制铁的技术提高质量。在后西峪找一个商人霍自中老汉，过去闹铁行有经验，他首先找到一大部分洋棍（铁）销路，揽下两个月的营生，组织了四十四盘炉，二百二十名工人有了事做。接着又找到镰剪铁的销路，只陈家庄就销售了八万斤。还帮助立壁推销了存的铁镢七百个，西峪等村推销铧八十三万多斤。这样便解决了一大部分工人的困难。
