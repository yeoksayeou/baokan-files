Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd. Shijiazhuang's primary and secondary education is increasingly developed. At the beginning of liberation, the male and female middle schools and commercial vocational schools jointly resumed classes, with a total of 1,305 students. Seventy-two primary schools resumed classes, with 10,869 students. Currently, there are three secondary schools: the Municipal Boys' Middle School, the Girls' Middle School, and the Normal School. Excluding the normal school students, there are currently 1,293 students in the boys' and girls' middle schools. The number of primary schools has increased to 79, with 14,531 students. The Municipal Education Bureau is extremely concerned about the students. At the time of the resumption of classes, it allocated more than 5,000 jin of millet to help poor students. During the winter vacation, it introduced a group of middle school students to the primary school teacher training class, and later introduced them to work as primary school teachers, other occupations, or transferred to specialized schools for study. Currently, in addition to the normal school students being provided with free room and board at public expense, the middle schools have 100 publicly funded students, and they also support poor students with work-study programs or provide them with study loans. Many of the original primary and secondary school teachers and staff continue to work for the Municipal Education Bureau, and 41 new primary school teachers have been newly hired from the local intellectual community.

　　石庄中小教育发达
  　贫寒学生享有读书机会
    【新华社晋察冀廿三日电】石家庄市中小学教育日益发达。解放之初，当时男中女中与商职联合复课，共有学生一千三百零五名，小学复课者七十二处，学生一万零八百六十九名；现中等学校分市立男中女中师范三校，除师范学生外，现在男中女中共有学生一千二百九十三名，小学增至七十九处，学生增至一万四千五百三十一名。市教育局对学生极为关切，复课时曾拨小米五千多斤救济贫寒学生，寒假中并介绍一部中学生入小学教师讲习班，后经介绍任小学教员、其他职业或转入专门学校学习。现除师范公费供给食宿外，中学设有公费生一百名，并扶助贫寒的半工半读或给以学习贷款，原来中小学教职员多人，仍继续供职市教育局，并从本市知识界新聘小学教员四十一人。
