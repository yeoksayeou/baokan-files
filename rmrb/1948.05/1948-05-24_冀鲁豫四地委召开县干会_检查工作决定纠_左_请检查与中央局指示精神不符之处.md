Hebei-Shandong-Henan News: The Fourth Prefecture Committee convened a meeting of cadres from various counties at the end of April to inspect work and correct "leftist" deviations. The meeting determined that the current deviation in work was that cadres, during the Party rectification, had rectified the "village cadre line." This resulted in the perception that old village cadres were "all black" (all bad). Cadres did not approach or educate them, but kicked them aside, creating panic and unease among village cadres, who then simply stopped working. Furthermore, bad elements spread rumors that the Poor Peasants League was a "desperate gang" that would struggle against cadres, making village cadres even more fearful. The village head of Chan Qiqiu in Hua County, fearing struggle, even attempted suicide by hanging. In addition, during this production and disaster relief effort, loans were not given to middle peasants, and middle peasants were not called upon to transport grain in exchange for work. Many middle peasants had been struggled against in the past, and this had not been corrected. During the Party rectification, it was proposed to strengthen the "poor and hired peasant viewpoint," but after returning, poor and hired peasants were seen smuggling without being stopped. In terms of supporting the army, providing labor, and mutual aid in production, middle peasants were also at a disadvantage. After discussion, the meeting decided: (1) Resolutely change the erroneous attitude towards village cadres. The basic principle is to reform and educate village cadres, dispel their ideological concerns, correct their shortcomings, and develop their strengths. It was proposed that serving the people well and correcting mistakes is the only way out. (2) For middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against and those who were wrongly labeled as secret agents, their losses should be compensated, and their secret agent labels should be removed. It should be explained that middle and poor peasants are one family, and they should not be fooled by bad elements, but should concentrate on production and be absorbed into the peasant association. (3) After discussion by the peasants, various restrictions on landlords and rich peasants should be cancelled separately. While being lenient, their mistakes should be criticized, telling them not to sabotage and to concentrate on production.

Branch Office Opinion:

The Fourth Prefecture Committee's decision to cancel various restrictions on landlords and rich peasants, saying: "After discussion by the peasants, various restrictions on landlords and rich peasants should be cancelled separately," is not in line with the Central Bureau's instruction to the Taiyue District Party Committee on resolutely correcting "leftist" adventurism, which stated: "Special controls on landlords, such as special armbands, signs, asking for leave to go out, reporting visitors, and other markers, should all be unconditionally and immediately abolished." It is hoped that the Fourth Prefecture Committee will make a clear examination based on this instruction from the Central Bureau.

　　冀鲁豫四地委召开县干会
  　检查工作决定纠“左”
    请检查与中央局指示精神不符之处
    【冀鲁豫消息】四地委于四月底召开了各县干部会，检查工作，纠正左倾偏向。认为当前工作中的偏向是干部在整党中整了“村干路线”，这次下去工作，就认为老村干是“一窝黑”（都不好），对他们不接近不教育，一脚踢开，造成村干的恐慌不安，躺倒不干。又加上坏分子的造谣，说贫农团是“拚命团”要斗干部哩，使得村干部更加害怕。滑县颤齐邱的村长怕斗争，曾上了一吊。另外在这次生产救灾中，贷款时不贷给中农款，以工代赈不叫中农运粮，过去斗争了许多中农，现在没有纠正。整党中提出加强“贫雇观点”，回来后见贫雇走私不缉，在支差代耕互助生产上，中农也吃亏。研究后，会上决定：（一）坚决转变对村干部的错误态度，对村干基本上是改造教育的方针，解除村干思想上的顾虑，纠正他的缺点发挥优点，提出好好为人民办事并改正错误才是出路。（二）对错斗中农及错戴了特务帽的中农，应补偿其损失，一律摘掉特务帽子，说明中贫农是一家，不要上坏分子的当，要安心生产，并吸收其参加农会。（三）经农民讨论，分别取消对地主富农的各种管制，一面宽大一面批评他的错误，叫他不准破坏，好好生产。
    分社意见：
    四地委对取消对地主富农的各种管制的决定中说：经农民讨论分别取消对地主富农的各种管制，与中央局给太岳区党委指示坚决纠正左倾冒险主义中所说的：“对地主特殊管制如特殊臂章牌号出门请假，来客报告及其他标帜等，均应一律立即无条件的取消”是不符合的。望四地委根据中央局的这一指示，做一明确的检查。
