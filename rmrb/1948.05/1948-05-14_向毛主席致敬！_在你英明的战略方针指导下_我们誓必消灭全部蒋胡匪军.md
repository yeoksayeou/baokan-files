Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th: People from all walks of life in Yan'an sent a special telegram to Chairman Mao at the victory rally celebrating the liberation of Yan'an. The original telegram is as follows:

Chairman Mao: Yan'an is back! Today we are holding a celebration rally in Yan'an. In our joy and excitement, we deeply resent the inhuman "burn all, kill all, loot all" policy of the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops, which has caused unprecedented disasters in our border region. While celebrating the victory, we especially miss you. You led us in making revolution and liberating ourselves, and you also led us in developing production and creating a life of abundance. During the difficult days of the past year or so, you were always with us, giving us a thousandfold more strength, enabling us to always have full confidence in persisting in the struggle against the enemy, actively supporting the front lines, and finally achieving the great victory—the liberation of Yan'an. The development of the Northwest war situation in the past year has fully proved the complete correctness of your strategic policy and military principles. We firmly believe that under your great and brilliant leadership, the time for the Chinese people to be liberated is not far away. We will do our best to do all our work well, seize the time to expand our lives, restore the pre-war cultivated land area, develop industry and commerce, prosper the border region economy, overcome all difficulties, overcome the famine, continue to work hard to support the front lines, and vow to eliminate all the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops, liberate the Great Northwest, and cooperate with all battlefields across the country to strive for the early arrival of the final victory. We would like to extend our highest respect to you on behalf of the people of the entire border region and wish you good health. Yan'an All Circles Celebration of the Liberation of Yan'an Victory Congress kowtows. 4th.
