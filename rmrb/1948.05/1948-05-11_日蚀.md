    From a little after nine o'clock on May 9th until ten twenty-five, the weather suddenly turned cold, the sunlight was very weak, and only a small portion of the sun remained. This is called a solar eclipse. Why does a solar eclipse happen? The reason is that the Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth. When the moon moves between the sun and the Earth, blocking the sunlight, a solar eclipse occurs. There are several types of solar eclipses. One where only a ring of light remains around the sun is called an annular eclipse. When only half of the sun is covered, it's called a partial eclipse. When the sun is completely blocked, it's called a total eclipse. The day before yesterday was a partial eclipse. Some villagers say that this is "the Black Fiend eating the Old Sun," and some others say that it is an "ominous sign." These are all superstitions and should not be believed. In fact, solar eclipses are very common natural phenomena. Two to five can be seen each year across the entire Earth, and there is nothing strange about them.

    日蚀
    从五月九日上午九点多钟开始，到十点二十五分，天气忽然变凉，太阳光线很弱，太阳剩下了小半边，这叫日蚀。为什么会发生日蚀呢？原因是地球围着太阳在转圈子，月亮又围绕地球在转圈子，月亮走到太阳与地球的中间，把太阳光线遮住了，就发生日蚀。日蚀有几种，太阳四周只留下一个圆圈的叫金环蚀，只遮住一半的叫部分蚀，全部把太阳遮没了的叫全蚀。前天是部分蚀。有些老乡说，这是“黑煞神吃了老阳”，还有些人说是“不祥之兆”，这些都是迷信话，不能相信。其实日蚀是很普通的自然现象，一年中全地球上共可以看到两次到五次，没有什么奇怪的。
