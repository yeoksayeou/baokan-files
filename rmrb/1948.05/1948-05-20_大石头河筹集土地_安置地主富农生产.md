　　Dashi Touhe Raises Land
　　Settle Landlords and Rich Peasants for Production
　　[Ping Shun News] Dashi Touhe Village, Qiqu, Ping Shun, has 132 households with 1,100 mu of land. Among the 21 households that were struggled against, 13 had no land to cultivate. The rest had very little land. This spring, during production, the households without land had no way to make a living and had to beg from everyone. Recently, after seeing the Central Bureau's instruction to the Taiyue District Party Committee on correcting left-leaning errors, district cadres in the village led production to overcome the famine and organized the masses to study the instruction. During the discussion, everyone said that it was a big problem that landlords and rich peasants had no land to cultivate. What they eat every day is still the blood and sweat of us peasants. They are not actively engaged in production, which is not good for us peasants. We should give them some land and let them cultivate it themselves. If they don't have enough to eat, borrow some grain from the farmers' association and let them produce well. Village cadres, who had previously acquired more land, returned 54.5 mu to them in order to settle the landlords and rich peasants for production, allowing them to work for a living. The masses said, "That's right! This is a good thing. If it were like before, the landlords and rich peasants would not do anything; even us, the masses, would be scared. Now that they have land to cultivate, they can afford to contribute and support the work, and they can also make a living, which is good for the peasants." The landlords and rich peasants said, "There's still a chance for us to live! We've been given land again! We must produce well. If we don't produce, the masses will look down on us." Then, the masses and the landlords helped each other in production, and their enthusiasm was great. The millet has already been planted. The sweet potatoes have been planted on 367 mu of land, and the corn on 431 mu will be completed by the end of the month. Now they are stepping up the planting of corn. (Feng Buge)
    Editor's note: It is feared that not all of these households that were struggled against were landlords and rich peasants. It is hoped that this will be checked.

　　大石头河筹集土地
  　安置地主富农生产
    【平顺消息】平顺七区大石头河村，有一百卅二户，土地一千一百亩。被斗过的廿一户，其中没地种的十三户。其余有些地的也很少。今春生产中，没地种的户因为生活没办法，只好向大家要饭吃。最近看到中央局给太岳区党委的纠左指示，区上干部就在该村一面领导生产渡荒，一面组织群众学习这个指示。大家讨论中，都说地主富农没有地种，是个大问题。他们每天吃的都还是咱农民的血汗，他们也不来积极生产，还不是对咱农民不利吗？还是给他们一些土地，叫他们自己来种才对。没有吃的，到农会里借上些粮食，让他们好好生产。村干部在过去多得了土地，这时为安置地主富农生产，就退出五十四亩半，分给他们，让他们劳动过活。群众都说：“对呀！这样做就是好，要象从前那样，地主富农什么也不干了；就说咱们群众吧，也是光害怕。今天他们有了地种，也能负担，也能支差，他自己也有了生活，对农民也有好处。”地主富农说：“还有咱活的天气哩！又给咱闹上地了！咱可得好好生产哩。不生产，群众就看不起咱来了。”接着，群众和地主互助起来搞生产，劲头很大。谷已经种完啦。三百六十七亩地蔓也种上了，四百三十一亩玉茭到月底完成，现在正加紧种玉茭。（冯步阁）
    编者意见：这些被斗户恐怕不一定都是地主富农，希作检查。
