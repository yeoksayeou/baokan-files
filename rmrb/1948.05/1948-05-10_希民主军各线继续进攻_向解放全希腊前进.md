Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: "The Greek Democratic Army is resolutely advancing towards the goal of completing the liberation of all Greece." This was the conclusion of a commentary on the war situation by the Free Greece radio station on the 2nd. The commentary stated: Throughout the winter, the Greek Democratic Army has continuously launched victorious attacks, shattering the enemy's powerful offensives, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, and forcing the enemy headquarters to deploy garrison troops and reserves into battle. This spring, the enemy attempted to drive the Democratic Army out of the northern part of the Bandus Mountains and the western part of the Aetolia Mountains, and attempted to strike the Democratic Army in the eastern part of central Greece, Karyas and the Olympus region. To this end, the enemy concentrated a large number of infantry, artillery and air force in Bogonia. However, on March 5th, the Democratic Army launched a counter-offensive from Mount Morghan as a base, defeating the stubborn enemy. On March 27th, the puppet army launched another offensive in the area, but suffered heavy casualties. On April 16th, the Democratic Army attacked the enemy in the Roumeli region, fighting for eight hours, annihilating many enemies, and has now penetrated deep behind enemy lines to carry out activities.

Another dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army continues to advance on all fronts. On April 26th, a battalion of the Democratic Army attacked the city of Alantreza, within nineteen kilometers of Patras (northern Morea), and occupied the city that night, calmly removing the spoils of war before taking the initiative to leave. Another unit of the Democratic Army advanced along the Euboean Strait, only forty kilometers from Athens.

　　希民主军各线继续进攻
  　向解放全希腊前进
    【新华社陕北七日电】“希民主军正向着完成解放全布腊的目标坚决前进”。这是自由希腊电台二日评战局的结语。该评论称：在整个冬天，希民主军不断胜利出击，粉碎了敌人的强大攻势，予敌重大打击，迫使敌军总部不得不把驻防军与后备队投入战斗。今年春天，敌人企图把民主军逐出班都斯山之北部与爱四鲁斯山之西部，并企图在希中东部卡希亚与奥林匹斯地区打击民主军。为此，敌在波哥尼亚集中了大批步兵炮兵与空军。然而民主军于三月五日，以莫尔干山为基地发动反攻，击溃顽敌。三月二十七日，伪军又在该区发动攻势，但伤亡累累。四月十六日，民主军于鲁米里亚地区出击敌军，作战八小时，歼敌甚众，现已深入敌后活动。
    另讯：希民主军在各线继续进攻。四月二十六日，民主军一营袭击巴特拉斯（摩里亚北部）十九公里以内阿兰得瑞查城，当晚即占领该城，从容搬走战利品后主动离开。民主军另部沿优卑亚海峡前进，距雅典仅四十公里。
