    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: The Information Bureau's journal "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" of the Communist Parties of nine European countries recently published an article by Spanish Communist leader Dolores Ibárruri entitled "The Spanish People Continue to Fight," pointing out that in order to resist fascist trade unions, Spanish workers have rebuilt their former underground democratic trade unions. Anti-fascist intellectual representatives have united around the secret organization "League for Intellectual Freedom," Republican military personnel have established the "Association of Armed Forces of the Spanish Republic" in major Spanish cities, women have formed the National Anti-Fascist Women's Organization, and the United Socialist Youth League has also joined the anti-Franco struggle. Guerrilla forces are extensively increasing their activities in Andalusia (south), Aragon, Levant (northeast), and Galicia (northwest). Franco is forced to use aircraft, artillery, and all means such as burning fields and provisions and driving residents from villages to deal with guerrilla activities. All this proves that the people's will to strive for the establishment of a democratic regime and a free life cannot be extinguished, whether by the betrayal of the leaders of the Socialist Party and anarchists, or by the US dollars and British pounds used to buy such betrayal. TASS, July 7th, citing Republican Spanish radio broadcasts: Spanish guerrillas are stepping up their activities near Ceuta, near Lille, in the New Castile province.

    西班牙人民加强组织
    坚持反佛朗哥斗争
    【新华社陕北十日电】贝尔格莱德讯：欧洲九国共产党情报局机关刊物“争取持久和平与人民民主”，顷刊载西共领袖伊巴露丽著“西班牙人民在继续战斗”一文，指出：西班牙工人为了对抗法西斯工会，已重建起以前的地下民主工会，反法西斯知识分子代表已团结在秘密组织“知识分子自由联盟”周围，共和分子——军人已在西班牙各大城市建立起“西班牙共和国武装部队协会”，妇女则已组成全国反法西斯妇女组织，统一社会主义青年团亦已参加反佛朗哥的斗争。游击队正在安达露西亚（南部）、亚拉冈、利凡特（东北）与加利西亚（西北）各地广泛地增强活动。佛朗哥被迫运用飞机大炮以及焚毁田野与粮草，把居民从村庄里赶走等一切手段，来对付游击队的活动。这一切证明：人民奋力以求建立民主政权和自由生活意志，不管是社会党与无政府主义者首领的背叛行为，抑是用以收买这种背叛行为的美元英镑，都不能消灭它。另据塔斯社七日电引共和西班牙电台广播：西游击队在新加斯提尔省休达，里尔附近正加强活动。
