[Jinan News] In Dang'erzhai, Linqing County, some party members used to be very undemocratic in their style of work and had bad behaviors such as occupying too much of the fruits of struggle, which aroused the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party. After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League and the subsequent democratic rectification of the Party, the party members were determined to repent and be good party members. Those who occupied too much of the fruits were willing to return them to the masses. For example, Li Huaili reflected and said: "In the past, I felt that I was a village cadre, and the masses dared not do anything to me. I occupied too much of the fruits. I have already divided three shares, two of which are first-class. Today I feel very wrong. I accept any criticism from the Poor Peasants' League, I have no objection." Those who had beaten and scolded the masses were willing to say good words and apologize to the masses. After a few days of party consolidation meetings, the masses had a further understanding of the Party, realizing that it was not the Party that was bad in the past, but that individual party members had problems in their style of work. With the full approval of the Poor Peasants' League, eleven party members were absorbed into the Poor Peasants' League. When reorganizing the river digging team, four party members were elected as squad leaders. In order to cooperate with the river digging, a general meeting of all party members was held, and the party members expressed their determination to take the lead in the river digging. Li Huaili said: "In the past, I was a village cadre and never did anything myself. Today, I must do the work ahead of everyone, so that the masses will understand that I am not the old Li Huaili." Li Cai said: "We must show the model of a Communist Party member, don't let others shout and yell!" Li Yunxiu said: "A Communist Party member should do more than others!" Li Shuyuan said: "Not only will I work hard, but I must also ensure that my class does a good job." Du Mingxin said: "If they complete it in three days, I guarantee that my class will complete it in two days and then help them." Li Jixiang said: "In the future, we really have to work hard, otherwise, the masses will say, what kind of party rectification is this?" All twenty-odd party members expressed their determination to lead the masses to complete the river digging task. In the end, it was stipulated that they should supervise and criticize each other in their work and regularly engage in organizational life.

　　党尔寨支部整党后
  　党员决心带头挖河
    【冀南消息】临清县党尔寨过去有部分党员作风很不民主，又有多占斗争果实等不好的行为，因此惹起群众对党的不满。贫农团成立后，经过民主整党，党员都决心痛改前非做个好党员。多占果实的愿退给群众。例如李怀理反省说：“过去我觉着自己是村干，群众不敢怎样我，多占了果实，我已经分了三个股，有两个都是头等，今天我觉着很不对，贫农团怎样批评我都接受，我没意见。”打骂过群众的愿向群众说好话道歉。几天的整党会上，群众对党有了进一步的认识，认识过去不是党不好，而是有个别的党员在作风上有毛病，经贫农团全体通过，吸收十一名党员参加了贫农团。在整编挖河队时，四个党员被选为班长，为了配合挖河，又召开了个全体党员会，党员在会上表示，决心要在挖河中起带头作用。李怀理说：“过去咱是村干，没动过手，今天一定把活做在头里，叫群众明白明白我不是以先的李怀理了。”李才说：“要显出共产党员模范来，别叫别人喊呀、叫呀！”李云岫说：“共产党员要比别人干的多才对哩！”李书元说：“不但我上劲干，还得保证我这一班都得干好。”杜明信说：“他们三天完成，我保证我班两天完成，再去帮助他们。”李吉祥说：“今后真得好好干，不的话，叫群众说你整党整的吗哟？”全体二十几个党员，都表示决心要带起群众来完成挖河任务。末后并规定了在工作中要互相监督、批评及经常过组织生活。
