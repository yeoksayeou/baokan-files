　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region News: The infringement of the interests of Changyuan merchants by the Administrative Office and the Fourth Administrative Office should be strictly investigated and thoroughly corrected. Our reporter Yu Qi wrote on the 7th: When the enemy ruled Changyuan, there was a cigarette-making machine in the city, with a total of more than twenty shares, with a capital of 308 million yuan in legal tender. Among them, the enemy held two shares, worth more than 48 million yuan in legal tender. The rest of the shares belonged to merchants in the Changyuan city area. Bai Yutian and Wang Pingjun were in charge. This machine was very new and could produce 1,000 packs of cigarettes (20 cigarettes per pack) per day. When our army captured Changyuan last December, a certain responsible comrade from the Fourth Administrative Office entered the city with the troops and occupied the factory. According to him, before the city was attacked, the cigarette factory belonged to the enemy. After entering the city, he inquired and found that not all of it belonged to the enemy, but mainly to the merchants and residents of Changyuan. People were unwilling to have it taken away, so he tried to persuade them there for three days, and finally took it away. I asked him if there was any coercion at the time, and he said, "I don't admit it was coercion." I think there is a problem: if it wasn't coercion, why persuade them for three days? After taking it out, he initially only gave people 3 million yuan in local currency. People thought it was too little, so he added another 500,000 yuan, for a total of 3.5 million yuan. This was considered the merchants' share. I asked him if the money given was too little, and he said, "Not little, at that time 2 million yuan could buy a machine. Because his machine was new, he was given 3.5 million yuan." Later, the YongSheng Cooperative of the Administrative Office invested 30 million yuan to start organ production. This spring, during party rectification, the higher authorities proposed centralized management. The Administrative Office did not believe that the machine belonged to the Changyuan merchants, saying it was the organ production of the Fourth Administrative Office. So, on April 23rd, it was reported to the Administrative Office. The Administrative Office gave people 2 million yuan in local currency, and the merchants refused to accept it. The Fourth Administrative Office had no choice. A few days ago, the person in charge of the machine was introduced by the Administrative Office to the Administrative Office to negotiate directly. I think this does not proceed from protecting industry and commerce. If it proceeds from protecting industry and commerce, it should carefully solicit the opinions of merchants. If they are willing to have joint operation, then have joint operation. If they are unwilling to have joint operation, the machine should be returned to them. Originally, giving 3.5 million yuan made people unhappy, and now giving 1.5 million yuan less is destroying industry and commerce. Now, the so-called public-private joint venture is also coercive, not voluntary. It is hoped that the Administrative Office and the Fourth Administrative Office will conduct a strict investigation and thoroughly correct it.

### 冀鲁豫四专署某负责同志　为何拉走人家卷烟机？ 请行署和四专署严格检查

　　冀鲁豫四专署某负责同志
  　为何拉走人家卷烟机？
    请行署和四专署严格检查
    【冀鲁豫消息】行署和四专署侵犯长垣商人利益，应严格检查彻底纠正。本报记者于琦七日来信称：敌人统治长垣时，城里有一部卷烟机器，共二十余股，资本三万万零八百万元法币。内有敌人两股，四千八百余万元法币。其余股金全是长垣城一带商人的。由白玉田、王平君二人负责。这个机子很新，廿盒一条的烟，每天能出一千条。去年十二月我军攻克长垣时，四专署某负责同志随部队入城，就占领了这个工厂。据他谈，没打城前，这个烟厂是敌人的；进去后，一问，并不都是敌人的，主要还是长垣一带商民的。人家不愿叫拉走，就在那里动员了三天，最后拉走了。我问他当时是否有些强制，他说：“我不承认是强制的。”我认为有问题：若是不强制，何必动员三天呢？弄出来后，开始只给人家打了三百万元本币；人家嫌少，又添了五十万元，共三百五十万元。这算商人的股。我问他是否打的钱少，他说：“不少，当时二百万元就可买个机子。因他这个机子新，才给三百五十万元。”以后专署的永生合作社投入三千万元，搞起机关生产。到今春整党，上级提出集中经营，行署不相信机子是长垣商人的，说是四专署的机关生产。就于四月二十三日报到行署。行署给人家打了二百万元本币，商人不干。四专署没法。前几天由专署介绍该机器负责人到行署去直接谈判。我认为这是没从保护工商业出发。若从保护工商业出发，就应该细心征取商人意见，愿合营就合营，不愿合营时，就应退还人家的机器。原来打三百五十万元，人家就不高兴，又少打一百五十万元，这不是破坏工商业吗？现在所谓公私合营，也是强制的，不是自愿的，希望行署和四专署严格检查，彻底纠正。
