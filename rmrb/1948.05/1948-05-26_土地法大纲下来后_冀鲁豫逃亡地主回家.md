　　After the Promulgation of the Land Law Outline

　　Landlords Fleeing from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Return Home

　　[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan report, dated 22nd] Since our First and Seventh Sub-districts publicized the Land Law Outline and rectified policies, fleeing landlords, returning legions, and wrongly struggled-against middle peasant households have been returning one after another, now totaling 1,600 people. The enemy is now in great internal turmoil and feels that there is no future. For example, some say: "We are seizing grain and conscripting soldiers, while the Eighth Route Army is providing disaster relief and loans. Can we continue like this?" The returning legions are also very dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's regular army. Some say: "They are squatting in the cities guarding the walls, while we are sent to seize grain and conscript soldiers, and we are the ones who get beaten." Now some returning legions are sending messages to our government wanting to go home. Some are afraid that their families will be harmed because their homes are close to the enemy, and they want to become prisoners of war. Some still have doubts about our policies. For example, more than ten people fled back from the Sixth District of Dongping, and at first they were all hiding in relatives' homes, watching to see if we were really lenient towards returning landlords. Some said, "If I had known this, I wouldn't have run away." The landlords at home said, "It's better to be honest. I knew long ago that you wouldn't last long outside." The masses are very satisfied with the policy. For example, some people said, "If we do this, the Central Army and the returning legions will run away." Many people are mobilizing the family members of puppets, saying, "Call your child back. As long as he is honest at home, we will guarantee his safety."

　　土地法大纲下来后
  　冀鲁豫逃亡地主回家
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】我一、七分区自宣传土地法大纲端正政策以来，逃亡地主还乡团、被错斗的中农逃亡户，纷纷回来，现已达一千六百人。现在敌人内部非常混乱，感觉没前途，如有的说：咱们抢粮抓丁，八路救灾贷款，这样下去，咱还行吗？还乡团对蒋匪正规军也很不满，有的说：“他们在城里蹲着守城，叫咱们前去抢粮抓丁，挨打的还是咱们。”现在有的还乡团给我政府捎信要回家。有的家离敌人近，怕家里受害，想当俘虏。有的对我们的政策还有怀疑，如东平六区跑回来了十多人，开始都是在亲戚家藏着，看我们是不是真宽大回来的地主。有的说早知道这样，俺不跑啦。在家的地主说，还是老老实实的好，我早就知道您在外边不长。群众对政策很满意，如有的群众说：“这样办，中央军还乡团跑就跑光啦。”许多群众动员伪属说：“把您小孩叫回来吧，他只要在家老老实实的，有事俺保险。”
