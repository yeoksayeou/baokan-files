Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: The Subei Liberation Army valiantly repulsed fourteen regiments of Chiang bandits who invaded the Yancheng and Funing areas, eliminating over 700 bandits. They have been driven back, and there are no enemy traces east of the Chao River. In late last month, Chiang bandits pieced together five regiments of the Reorganized 83rd Division, six regiments of the Reorganized 72nd Division, one regiment of the Reorganized 51st Division, and two regiments of the Reorganized 44th Division, a total of fourteen regiments, to form the Northern Route "Suppression" General Corps, led by Zhang Xuezhong, commander of the Huaiyin Pacification Area of the bandit army. They invaded our Yancheng and Funing areas from Huaiyin, Huai'an, Lianshui, and Sheyangzhen in four routes, successively occupying Suju, Dachong, Banhu, Chenji, Fenggucun, Yilin, Donggou, and other places. One route even captured Funing City on the 9th of this month. The Liberation Army repelled the enemy at every stage, inflicting casualties. From the 9th to the 11th, fierce battles were fought with the enemy along the Chao River, more than ten li east of Yilin Town. Bandit leader Zhang Xuezhong personally commanded, and the Reorganized 72nd Division concentrated over 40 artillery pieces and used aircraft to assist in a fierce attack on our positions, repeatedly attempting to forcibly cross the Chao River, but all were repelled by the Liberation Army. At this point, the bandits' strong attack failed, and fearing annihilation, they retreated to the Fenggucun and Sujuzhuang areas on the 14th and 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: The local armed forces in Huaibei recovered S County town for the third time on the 16th. The defending enemy, the 180th Brigade of the Reorganized 59th Division, abandoned the city and fled. S County town was previously recovered by us twice on October 11th of last year.
