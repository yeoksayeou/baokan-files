Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: The following are excerpts from Chairman Mao's writings on guiding the masses in production:

　　"Developing agricultural production is the direct purpose of land reform. Only by eliminating the feudal system can we obtain the conditions for developing agricultural production. In any region, once the feudal system has been eliminated and the task of land reform has been completed, the Party and the democratic government must immediately propose the task of restoring developing agricultural production, transferring all possible forces in the countryside to the restoration and development of agricultural production, organizing cooperation and mutual assistance, improving agricultural technology, improving seeds, developing water conservancy, so that increased production becomes possible. The greatest part of the rural Party's energy must be placed on restoring and developing agricultural production and industrial production in towns and cities. In order to rapidly restore and develop agricultural production and industrial production in towns and cities, in the struggle to eliminate the feudal system, we must pay attention to making every effort to maximize the preservation of all available means of production and means of livelihood, and take measures to resolutely oppose anyone's destruction and waste of means of production and means of livelihood, oppose extravagance and waste, and pay attention to thrift. In order to develop agricultural production, we must advise farmers to gradually organize themselves, on the principle of voluntariness, into various production and consumption cooperative groups based on private ownership that are permitted by the current economic conditions. Eliminating the feudal system and developing agricultural production lays the foundation for the task of developing industrial production and transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country, which is the ultimate goal of the new democratic revolution." (Speech at the Cadre Meeting in Jin-Sui Liberated Area)

　　"If the reform of the mode of production from individual labor to collective labor is not carried out, then the productive forces cannot be further developed. Therefore, it is very necessary to build labor mutual aid organizations based on the individual economy (without destroying the basis of individual private property), that is, agricultural production cooperatives of farmers. Only in this way can the productive forces be greatly improved." (On Cooperatives)

　　"On the part of the peasant masses, for thousands of years they have been an individual economy, with each household as a production unit. This decentralized individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into perpetual poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only road to collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives. In the border region, we have now organized many peasant cooperatives, but they are not the kind of cooperatives in the Soviet Union called collective farms. Our economy is new democratic, and our cooperatives are collective labor based on the individual economy (based on private property).

　　……Organizing the power of all the masses into a labor army is the only way for the people to be liberated, the only way to change from poverty to prosperity……

　　Every Communist Party member must learn to organize the labor of the masses. Party members of intellectual origin must also learn. As long as they are determined, they can learn it in half a year or a year. They can help the masses organize production and help the masses summarize their experiences. In the past, many of our comrades also had Confucius' shortcomings. When Confucius' students asked about how to grow crops and how to grow vegetables, Confucius could not answer. Our comrades could not answer either. But our comrades have now learned it, and they can answer. They are more intelligent than Confucius.

　　"If our comrades who do local work are divorced from the masses, do not understand the emotions of the masses, cannot help the masses organize production, improve their lives, and only know how to ask them for national salvation public grain, but do not know that they should first use 90% of their energy to help the masses solve their 'private grain for saving the people' problem, and then only use 10% of their energy to solve the public grain problem for saving the country, then this is infected with the Kuomintang style, infected with the dust of bureaucracy. The Kuomintang only asks the people for things and does not give the people anything at all. If we Communist Party members are also like this, then the style of such party members is the Kuomintang style, and a layer of bureaucratic dust is piled on the faces of such party members, and they must be washed clean with a basin of hot water." (Get Organized!)

　　"Organize the people, lead the people, help the people develop production, increase their material welfare, and on this basis, step by step, raise their political consciousness and cultural level. For this purpose, we should not be afraid of wind and frost, work hard day and night, diligently and conscientiously study the problems of life and production among the people, cattle, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, water conservancy, pasture, agricultural loans, immigration, reclamation, improved farming methods, women's labor, labor of loafers, resettlement plans, cooperatives, mutual aid teams, transportation teams, textile industry, animal husbandry, salt industry and other important issues, and help the people solve these problems specifically rather than talking empty words. This aspect of work is the first priority of every Communist Party member working in rural areas. Only after we have done this aspect of work and it has indeed produced results, can we obtain the support of the people when we do the second aspect of work—the work of asking the people for things. They will say that it is right and proper for us to ask for things. They will understand that if they do not send grain and grass to the government, their lives will not be good or better. In this way, our work will not be forced, it will feel smooth, and it will feel like we are truly one with the people. This is the fundamental line and fundamental policy of our Party, and every comrade (including comrades in the army) should study it carefully. Only when our comrades understand and implement the coordination of these two aspects of work can we be regarded as a complete communist revolutionary. Otherwise, although we are also doing revolutionary work, and although we are also a revolutionary, we are not a complete revolutionary. Moreover, for some comrades, they are still bureaucrats who are divorced from the masses, because they only know how to ask the masses for things, but they do not know or are unwilling to give the masses anything, causing the masses to dislike them. This issue is very important, and I hope everyone will pay close attention to it and publicize this principle to the whole Party." (Economic Problems and Financial Problems)

### 毛主席论领导群众生产

　　毛主席论领导群众生产
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】毛主席著作中对领导群众生产的指示摘录如下文：
    “发展农业生产，是土地改革的直接目的。只有消灭封建制度，才能取得发展农业生产的条件。在任何地区，一经消灭了封建制度，完成了土地改革任务，党和民主政府就必须立即提出恢复和发展农业生产的任务，将农村中的一切可能的力量转移到恢复和发展农业生产的方面去，组织合作互助，改良农业技术，改良种子，兴办水利，务便增产成为可能。农村党的精力的最大部分，必须放在恢复和发展农业生产及市镇上的工业生产上面。为了迅速地恢复和发展农业生产及市镇上的工业生产，在消灭封建制度的斗争中，必须注意尽一切努力最大限度地保存一切可用的生产资料和生活资料，采取办法坚决地反对任何人对于生产资料和生活资料的破坏和浪费，反对大吃大喝，注意节约。为了发展农业生产，必须劝告农民在自愿原则下逐步地组织为现时经济条件所许可的以私有制为基础的各种生产的和消费的合作团体。消灭封建制度，发展农业生产，就给发展工业生产，变农业国为工业国的任务奠定了基础，这就是新民主主义革命的最后目的。”（在晋绥干部会议的讲话）
    “如果不从个体劳动转移到集体劳动的生产方式的改革，则生产力还不能获得进一步的发展。因此，建设在以个体经济为基础（不破坏个体的私有财产基础）的劳动互助组织，即农民的农业生产合作社，就是非常需要了，只有这样，生产力才可以大大提高。”（论合作社）
    “在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。在边区，我们现在已经组织了许多的农民合作社，不过还不是苏联式的被称为集体农庄的那种合作社。我们的经济是新民主主义的，我们的合作社是建立在个体经济基础上（私有财产基础上）的集体劳动。
    ……把全部群众的力量组织成为一支劳动大军，这是人民群众得到解放的必由之路，由穷苦变富裕的必由之路………。
    每一个共产党员，必须学会组织群众的劳动。知识分子出身的党员，也必须学会，只要有决心，半年一年工夫就可以学好的，他们可以帮助群众组织生产，帮助群众总结经验。以前，我们的许多同志也有孔夫子的缺点，孔夫子的学生问到如何种庄稼如何种蔬菜的事情时，孔夫子就答不上来，我们的同志也答不上来。但是我们的同志现在是学会了，他们答得上来了，他们就比孔夫子高明了。
    “如果我们做地方工作的同志脱离了群众，不了解群众的情绪，不能够帮助群众组织生产，改善生活，只知道向他们要救国公粮，而不知道首先用百分之九十的精力去帮助群众解决他们‘救民私粮’的问题，然后仅仅用百分之十的精力就可以解决救国公粮的问题，那末，这就是沾染了国民党作风，沾染了官僚主义的灰尘。国民党就是只问老百姓要东西，而不给老百姓以任何一点什么东西的。如果我们共产党员也是这样，那末，这种党员的作风就是国民党作风，这种党员的脸上就堆上了一层官僚主义的灰尘，就得用一盆热水好好洗干净。”（组织起来）
    “组织人民领导人民帮助人民发展生产，增加他们的物质福利，并在这个基础上一步一步地提高他们的政治觉悟与文化程度。为着这个，我们应该不惜风霜劳苦，夜以继日，勤勤恳恳，切切实实地去研究人民中间的生活问题，生产问题，耕牛、农具、种籽、肥料、水利、牧草、农贷、移民、开荒、改良农作法、妇女劳动、二流子劳动、安家计划、合作社、变工队、运输队、纺织业、畜牧业、盐业等等重要问题，并帮助人民具体地而不是讲空话地去解决这些问题。这一方面的工作是每个在农村工作的共产党员的第一位工作。只在做了这一方面的工作，并确实生了成效之后，我们去做第二方面的工作——向人民要东西的工作时，我们才能取得人民的拥护，他们才会说我们要东西是应该的，是正当的，他们才会懂得他们如不送出粮草等等东西给政府，则他们的生活就不会好，就不会更好。这样我们的工作才不是勉强的，才会感觉顺利，才会感觉真正和人民打成一片了。这就是我们党的根本路线，根本政策，每个同志（军队的同志也在内）都要好好去研究。只在我们的同志懂得并实行了这样两方面工作的配合时，我们方能算得上称为一个完全的共产主义的革命家。否则我们虽也在做革命工作，虽也是一个革命家，却还不是一个完全的革命家。而且，对于某些同志说来，他们还是一个脱离群众的官僚主义者，因为他们只知道向群众要东西，却不知道或不愿意给群众一点东西，引起群众讨厌他们。这个问题非常重要，希望大家十分注意，并向全党宣传这个道理。”（经济问题与财政问题）
