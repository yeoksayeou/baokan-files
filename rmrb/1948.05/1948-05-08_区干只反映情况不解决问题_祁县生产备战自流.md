　　District Cadres Only Reflect the Situation, Not Solve Problems;
  　Qi County Production and War Preparations Left to Drift
    [Qi County News] After mobilizing and deploying spring plowing, disaster relief, and war preparations in mid-March, the county found that the masses' enthusiasm for production was still not high after more than 20 days. After inspection by the county party committee, the following problems were discovered: (1) District cadres, after party rectification, had not learned the leadership methods of the mass line. In their work, they were too cautious, only able to understand the situation and reflect problems from below, but not daring to solve problems or lead the masses. In implementing the class line and policies, they wanted to rely on the poor and hired peasants but feared following a blind poor and hired peasant line; they wanted to rely on the middle peasants but feared the poor and hired peasants would be dissatisfied, which would be even worse. "Relying on the poor and hired peasants and uniting with the middle peasants" was good, but many practical problems could not be solved. Thus, the idea of not daring to work and only seeking to avoid mistakes was generated. (2) The work focus was not clear, only paying attention to the land reform issue, neglecting the solution of production difficulties and the organizational leadership of production. There was insufficient understanding that failure to wage war well would expand the disaster. Many villages were constantly robbed by the enemy, and the disaster was becoming increasingly serious. (3) Most villages had not carried out party rectification and democratic replenishment movements. Village cadres heard that cadres had been dismissed in land reform experiment villages. Everyone was preparing to be punished and lay down on the job; cadres with minor mistakes were also afraid of making mistakes and dared not do anything. New cadres who could truly represent the interests of the masses had not been elected, and no one was leading the masses. (4) Some villages themselves established "Poor Peasants' Leagues." Individual bad elements sneaked into the leagues, using the name of the "Poor Peasants' League" to create friction in the villages, making the peasant ranks very chaotic. For example, in Xiaozhuang, a person named HaiShui in the "Poor Peasants' League" had not suffered in the past and was a hooligan. Now he held power in the "Poor Peasants' League." The poor peasants did not dare to provoke him, and the middle peasants were also afraid. No one dared to actively produce. After learning about these problems, the county immediately instructed each district to strengthen the leadership of war and production. It also promoted the spirit of "one person doing the work of two" in the county-level leading organs, assigning the work of various departments of the organs to a few people to persevere, and extracting 19 cadres to organize a production and war preparation work team, divided into four groups, to rush to each district and vigorously organize spring plowing and war preparation work.

　　区干只反映情况不解决问题
  　祁县生产备战自流
    【祁县消息】本县从三月中旬动员布置春耕救灾与备战工作后，经过廿几天，群众生产劲头仍不大。近经县委检查，发现有以下几个问题：（一）区干部经过整党，并未学会群众路线的领导方法，工作上成了束手束脚，只能在下面了解情况，反映问题，不敢下手解决问题，领导群众。在执行阶级路线与政策上，想依靠贫雇，怕走了盲目的贫雇路线；想依靠中农又怕贫雇不满，更加不对。“依靠贫雇、团结中农”很好，但好多实际问题又解决不了。于是产生了不敢工作、但求无过的思想。（二）工作方针不明确，只注意土改问题，忽视生产困难的解决与对生产的组织领导。对于搞不好战争会扩大灾荒，更认识不足。不少村庄不断遭敌抢掠，灾荒日益严重。（三）大部村庄没有进行整党与民主填补运动，村干部听到土改实验村撤职干部，大家都准备受处分，躺倒不干；错误小的干部也光怕干错，不敢干，真正能代表群众利益的新干部又没选出，没人领导群众。（四）有些村自己成立了“贫农团”，个别坏分子钻进团里，假借“贫农团”名义在村里制造磨擦，把农民阵营闹得很乱。如小庄“贫农团”里一个叫海水的，过去没受过苦，是个流氓，现在“贫农团”里掌了权，贫农不敢惹，中农也害怕，谁也不敢积极生产了。县里了解了这些问题后，除立即指示各区加紧领导战争与生产外，又在县级领导机关中发扬“一个人顶两个人用”的精神，把机关各部工作交给少数人坚持，抽出十九个干部，组织了一个生产备战工作队，分四个小组赶赴各区，大力组织春耕与备战工作。（祁县联合办公室）
