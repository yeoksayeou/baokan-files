Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: Shenyang Correspondence: The Chiang bandit forces in Shenyang, surrounded on all sides by the People's Liberation Army, have reached the end of their road. The once incomparably ferocious Chiang bandit Northeast provinces' exiled "reception officials" feel the heat is on and the overall situation is lost. They are taking their families and fleeing south. Chiang bandit henchmen are arguing endlessly to buy plane tickets. The black market plane ticket price, which was recently 30 million Chiang currency, now requires at least five gold bars (equivalent to over 3 billion Chiang currency). Those big and small corrupt officials who cannot escape are in despair, indulging in lavish eating and drinking.

A special agent terror covers the entire Shenyang area. The fascist "police district system" has been implemented in Shenyang. The so-called police are all special agents who have received "technical training" and can inspect households at any time. Gong Tianmin, general manager of Zhicheng Bank on Dabeimen Road East, was arrested with the label of a member of the Democratic League. Some of the eighty-six students recently expelled from Northeastern University have disappeared, and some are under surveillance. Students at the school who like to talk are seen as "left-leaning," while those who don't like to talk are considered by special agents to be without awareness of the turbulent situation and also face the danger of being persecuted at any time. The Chiang bandits' reckless issuance of banknotes to extract the people's blood and sweat has caused continuous price increases. Sorghum rice has risen from 41,000 Chiang currency per catty to over 150,000 recently. Under the heavy burden of Chiang bandit taxes and the monopoly oppression of bureaucratic capital, industries and businesses are collapsing one after another. According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Section of the Chiang bandit Shenyang Municipal Social Bureau, 20% of the city's factories and shops had applied to register for closure before the new year. According to Yu Enqi, chairman of the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, by the end of March of this year, the number of companies that had closed or were semi-closed had reached 40%. More than 150,000 workers and shop assistants have been laid off and are unemployed. Employees of Chiang bandit agencies are generally trapped in hunger and destitution. The Chiang bandit Shenyang Municipal Government and the China Changchun Railway have not paid salaries for three months. All the students of "Zhongzheng University," run by Du Yuming, have been without food four times. The lives of students at other schools are even more miserable. Most of the middle schools in the city have been forced to close, filled with Chiang bandit wounded soldiers.

Under the cruel plunder of the Chiang bandits, the vast majority of citizens can no longer live. Wang Huayi, a Chiang bandit supervisory committee member, also admitted: "More than 500,000 people in Shenyang City cannot even afford bean cakes and bean dregs every day." Worker Wang, who was over fifty years old and had worked in the Chiang bandit arsenal, starved to death. Before he died, he waved his hand and whispered: "I want to eat cornbread." Li Fengxiang, a worker at the Tiexi Coal Liquefaction Plant, strangled his three children to death because he could not live, and then committed suicide with his wife by taking arsenic. Similar tragedies are too numerous to mention. The people of Shenyang have been forced to carry out anti-hunger struggles. Grain riots by starving people have successively occurred in the Northwest Bianmen, the Outer East Bianmen, the Da Dong Bianmen, and various districts of the city. The Chiang bandits have arrested and massacred the grain-grabbing masses with extreme cruelty. The people of Shenyang have placed their only hope on the People's Liberation Army. The topic of conversation on the streets is: "When will the Eighth Route Army enter the city?"

　　
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tianjin News: Because the people refuse to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang bandit gang, Chiang bandit conscription in Tianjin and Beijing is facing numerous difficulties. The original conscription quota for Tianjin Chiang bandits was 7,500 people (the city has a population of 1.7 million), and the deadline has been extended again and again, but less than one-third has been recruited. Recently, the age of those forced to participate in the lottery has been extended from 21 to 25 years old, to 30 years old. The restrictions on deferment qualifications are extremely strict, and even news reporters and clerical personnel in semi-military agencies must serve. Another piece of news: The Chiang bandit mayor of Beiping has also recently ordered that the unfinished conscription plan be stepped up. The Beiping Municipal Bandit Civil Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau have decided to investigate strong beggars or homeless vagrants on the streets or in slum areas, preparing to arrest them to supplement the army, and have sent personnel to Yangliuqing, Jinghai, Tanggu, Tangshan, Langfang and other places near Tianjin to capture recruits.

　　沈阳在饥饿中
  　贪官污吏争相南逃
    【新华社东北十五日电】沈阳通讯：在解放军四面包围中的沈阳蒋匪，已日暮途穷。过去凶恶无比的蒋匪东北各省流亡“接收大员”，都感到火烧眉毛大势已去，携带其家属纷纷南逃。蒋匪爪牙为争购飞机票争吵不休，黑市飞机票价不久前尚为蒋币三千万，现在起码要五根金条（折合蒋币三十亿以上），那些逃不了的大小贪官污吏，则终日潦倒，大吃大喝。
    特务恐怖笼罩整个沈阳，法西斯的“警官区制”已在沈市实施，所谓警察都是受过“技术训练”的特务，他们可以随时检查住户。大北门路东志成银行总经理巩天民即被加以民盟盟员头衔而逮捕；东北大学最近被开除的八十六名学生有的已失踪，有的受监视，在校学生爱说话的被目为“左倾”，不爱说话的，特务又说是：“时局这样动荡你难道没有知觉”，也有随时被迫害的危险。蒋匪滥发流通券榨取人民血汗，造成了物价不断上涨，高粱米由蒋币四万一千元一斤一直涨到最近的十五万元以上。在蒋匪苛杂累累及官僚资本的垄断压迫下，工商业纷纷倒闭。蒋匪沈市社会局工商科统计供认，全市工厂商号年前申请登记歇业的已达百分之二十。至今年三月底据沈市商会理事长余恩祺透露，已倒闭及半倒闭者更达百分之四十。被解雇失业工人店员达十五万余名。蒋匪机关员工普遍陷于饥饿绝境，匪沈阳市政府及中长铁路已三个月未发薪。杜匪聿明所办“中正大学”全体学生已四次断炊，其他学校学生生活更苦，市内中学大多数被迫停办，住满蒋匪伤兵。
    在蒋匪残酷掠夺下广大市民已无法生活，蒋匪监察委员王化一亦供认：“沈阳市有五十万人以上每日连豆饼豆腐渣都吃不上”。曾在蒋匪兵工厂内做工的五十多岁的工人王某活活饿死，临死时还摆着手微呼：“我要窝窝头吃”。铁西石炭液化工厂工人李凤翔因无法生活，先勒死三个孩子，随与其妻同服砒霜自杀。类此惨剧不胜枚举。沈市人民已被迫而进行反饥饿斗争，西北边门、外东边门、大东边门以及市内各区已相继发生饥民抢米风潮。蒋匪穷凶极恶的逮捕和屠杀抢粮群众。沈市人民已把唯一的希望寄托在人民解放军身上，街谈巷议的题目是：“八路什么时候进城？”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】天津消息：由于人民拒绝充当蒋匪帮炮灰，平津蒋匪征兵困难重重。天津蒋匪征兵额原定七千五百名（该市人口一百七十万），限期一延再延，迄未征足三分之一，近复将被强迫参加抽签者的年龄由二十一岁到二十五岁，延长至三十岁。对缓役资格限制极严，连新闻记者和半军事机关的文职人员，亦非服役不可。另息：北平蒋匪市长近亦命令加紧进行迄未完成之征兵计划，平市匪民政局及警察局已决定调查街头或贫民区中之壮年乞丐或无家可归之流浪者，准备抓捕补充，并派员到天津附近杨柳青、静海、塘沽、唐山、廊坊等地抓丁。
