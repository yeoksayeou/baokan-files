　　【Taihang News】The district cadres of the Fourth District of Licheng recently held a meeting to review their leadership in production and discovered a common tendency to belittle production, an unwillingness to lead production, and a sole desire to do democratic land redistribution work, feeling that only democratic land redistribution could improve and transform themselves. Tian Guirong said: "After participating in the Party rectification study, I was focused on gaining experience in land reform so I could do a good job later. When I was transferred to production work, I felt somewhat dissatisfied, but I didn't dare say it, and this issue was always on my mind. Furthermore, I accepted the spirit of Party rectification one-sidedly, which generated a one-sided poor and hired peasant viewpoint, and I was afraid of making mistakes, so I just relied on the higher-ups. I didn't dare to handle problems myself. For example, the fake poor peasant group in Hexi seized power, only created conflict with the cadres. The cadres attended the meeting but they didn’t participate. Every day they would get up to find fault, satirize the cadres, confiscate the cadres’ property, fire some cadres' donkeys, dismiss this person, send that person to the people's court, which made the whole village very chaotic. The cadres were also afraid. No matter how I explained it, I didn't dare to do anything. I was just afraid of going the wrong way, afraid that people would say I didn't have a poor and hired peasant viewpoint in the future. I wrote a letter to the responsible comrade in the district, and they told me to handle it as I saw fit. I couldn't do anything, and production never got going." In Pingtou Village, the poor peasant group was taken over by the hooligan Wang Tianzhang as the director, and he acted recklessly, cleaning out all the middle peasants from a saltpeter workshop, and instigating the sealing of cadres' and wealthy middle peasants' doors. The cadres did not dare to boldly handle these phenomena and resolutely correct them. In Tianbu Village, due to the cadres' neglect of production, the masses' enthusiasm for production was even lower. After reviewing, everyone agreed that this kind of thinking and practice was wrong. The responsible comrades of each work team unanimously believed that delaying the masses' production was a big problem. If the land is not farmed well and less grain is harvested, it is not for the benefit of the masses, but harms the masses. In the future, we must correct the one-sided poor and hired peasant line, boldly implement the Central Committee's complete class line, and the poor peasant group in Pingtou Village should be disbanded. Finally, it was decided that Tianbu Village should be properly arranged, and several responsible comrades from the central group should be transferred to spend time in each base point, concentrating their efforts to create experience in production work and promote overall development.

　　不愿领导生产  不敢纠正偏向
  　黎城四区干部思想不对头
    【太行消息】黎城四区区干部于最近开会检查生产领导，发现普遍存在着轻视生产，不愿领导生产，光愿做民主填补工作，觉得只有民主填补能提高自己，改造自己。田贵荣说：“我参加整党学习后，一心要在土改中得些经验，以后好好干；一调我做生产工作，我心里就有些不满，可是不敢说，常在思想上存在这个问题。再加上片面接受整党精神，产生片面贫雇观点，以及怕犯错误，所以就光依靠上级。遇到问题也不敢处理。如河西假贫农团掌了权，光和干部闹矛盾，干部开会他们不去参加，每天起来找错，讽刺干部，要没收这个干部财产，下那个干部的驴，这个撤职，那个送人民法庭，闹的全村很乱，干部也害了怕，我怎样解释也不敢干。我虽然觉得很不对，但也不敢说，光怕走错了路线，怕将来说咱没有贫雇观点。我写信问区的负责同志，他们说叫我看着办吧。我也没办法，生产始终搞不起来”。平头村贫农团被流氓王天章当了主任，胡作胡为，把一座硝坊中全部中农都清洗出去，并策动封干部封富裕中农的门，干部对这些现象都不敢大胆处理，坚决纠正。填补村由于干部忽视生产，群众生产情绪更低。经过检讨，大家一致认识这种思想和做法是错误的。各工作组负责同志一致认为：耽误了群众生产是个大问题，种不好地，少打了粮食，不是为群众，而是害群众。今后一定要纠正片面的贫雇路线，大胆的执行中央完整的阶级路线，平头村的贫农团应该解散。最后并决定填补村应很好安排，并抽调中心组的几个负责同志，抽时间到各基点集中力量创造生产工作经验，推动全面。
