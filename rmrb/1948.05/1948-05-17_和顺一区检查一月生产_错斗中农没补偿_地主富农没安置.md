　　Heshun First District Inspects One Month of Production
  　Middle Peasants Wrongly Struggled Against Without Compensation
  　Landlords and Rich Peasants Not Resettled
    [Our Newspaper's News] The First District work team convened a meeting of village chiefs, branch secretaries, and production committee members from various villages on May 2nd to summarize the production work of the past month. The meeting focused on inspecting the compensation for middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against and the resettlement of landlords and rich peasants. The meeting studied the new standards for class demarcation and experimented with classifying the status of households that had been struggled against in three villages. This was done to better distinguish landlords, rich peasants, and wrongly struggled middle peasants in non-land reform experimental villages, so as to carry out compensation and resettlement. According to statistics from all thirty-one villages in the district, a total of 425 households (excluding land-donating households) with 1,979 people were struggled against, holding 7,053 mu, 7 fen, and 8 li of land. Among them, 75 households, with 308 people, were swept out the door. Among all the households struggled against, there was no grain to eat and generally no livestock or seeds. In the nine villages of the Dongweima base point, most of the households struggled against received no compensation or resettlement. Furthermore, wrongly struggled households were not distinguished from true landlords and rich peasants. On the one hand, this was due to a lack of understanding of the standards for class demarcation; on the other hand, village cadres were unwilling to clarify the situation. According to the thinking of cadres in Dongweima and Nan'anyi villages, they felt ashamed and embarrassed when a household was classified as wrongly struggled against, and they dared not face their past mistakes. Another problem was lending land to those already well-off. For example, in Baiquan Village, all 28 households that borrowed land were those who had already been thoroughly turned over, while poor peasants and farm laborers with little land did not borrow any. Landlords and rich peasants were not resettled. For example, in Xing Village, a family of military dependents already had 10 shi of grain per person, but because they were assertive, the cadres, fearing objections, lent them another 2 shi.

    The main reasons why wrongly struggled households were not compensated and landlords and rich peasants were not resettled were: (1) The leadership's policies were not firm and clear enough, and no specific methods were pointed out. As a result, cadres did not consider it a priority, and village cadres were fundamentally unwilling to carry out resettlement. Coupled with the leadership's tailism, they did not delve into the work and treated the one-sided opinions of a few as the opinions of the masses. Those who insisted on correct opinions were instead attacked. In Baiquan Village, the chairman of the farmers' association raised the point at a land-lending meeting that land should not be lent to those already well-off. As a result, he was attacked by a group of ambitious elements and expelled from the meeting on the spot. Although the leadership at the time inwardly thought the cadre was wronged, they did not uphold principles and one-sidedly considered it the "mass line," resulting in wrongly struggled middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants not receiving compensation and resettlement. (2) Village cadres had resistant sentiments and made excuses that resettlement was impossible. The Xiyao branch secretary said: "I didn't understand it in the first place, and seeing that other villages hadn't done any resettlement either, I didn't do it. I was also afraid of being criticized by others for being the first to act." The Sanquan village chief said: "I'm afraid of losing face. I struggled against them in the past, and now it's even harder to lend them land than it is for landlords. My approach is for cadres not to take the lead, but to let households with more land lend some poor land that they can't farm." The Xiweweima production committee member said: "Our village is poor and has nothing, so there's no way to carry out resettlement." In short, they were all looking for reasons not to compensate and resettle, with some even saying: "They won't starve to death even without resettlement. They were swept out the door last July, and they're still alive!" When discussing why landlords should be resettled, they all said it was okay in principle, but when it came to concrete solutions, they raised a lot of difficulties. Some said there were no fruit tree plots in the village, others said the land that had been lent out had already been sown and fertilized. Still others said, "We can get through to them, but what if we can't get through to the masses?" The work team repeatedly explained that resettling landlords and rich peasants and having them engage in labor and production would also benefit our peasants. Then, some specific resettlement methods were discussed: such as stopping the harsh control of households that had been struggled against, allowing them freedom of production and movement, allowing them to join mutual aid groups, allowing women from landlord and rich peasant families to marry freely, and forbidding anyone from forcing or restricting them. Supplying them with land yielding 2 shi of grain, forbidding anyone from begging for food, forbidding any compulsory labor, and forbidding special wage provisions, ensuring that no one would starve to death, etc. Various methods were used to enable them to live and to find land for them to cultivate.

    In order to strengthen leadership, five leading production cadres were originally assigned. Five more were drawn from the filling team to form five groups for inspection, with a provision for reporting every five days and summarizing every ten days.

### 和顺一区检查一月生产　错斗中农没补偿　地主富农没安置

　　和顺一区检查一月生产
  　错斗中农没补偿
  　地主富农没安置
    【本报消息】一区工作团于五月二日召开各村村长、支书、生产委员会议，总结一月来的生产工作，着重检查了补偿错斗中农和安置地富的工作，学习了划阶级的新标准，并实验划了三个村被斗户的成份，为的是在非土改实验村好区别地主、富农与错斗中农，以便进行补偿和安置。根据全区三十一个村的统计，被斗户共四百二十五户（献地户未统计在内），一千九百七十九口人，有土地七千零五十三亩七分八厘，其中扫地出门的七十五户，三百零八口人。整个被斗户中，无粮食吃、普遍的没有牲口、种子。东喂马基点九个村，被斗户大部没补偿和安置。再就是被斗户中没有分清错斗户与真正地主富农，一方面由于不了解划阶级标准，另方面村干部也不愿划清。据东喂马、南安驿两个村的干部思想，凡划成错斗户时，就觉得丢脸，不好意思，不敢正视过去的错误。另外是把土地借到圪堆上。如白泉村廿八户借地的都是翻透身的，其他少地贫雇没有借到，地主、富农没有安置。如邢村一户抗属本来每人已有十石产粮的地，因为厉害，干部怕提意见，又借到二石。
    错斗户没有补偿、和地富没有安置的主要原因是：（一）领导上方针不够坚决明确，更没有指出具体办法，因之在干部思想上没有当成重点，村干部思想上根本就不愿安置；加上领导的尾巴主义，没深入工作，把片面的少数人的意见当成群众意见，坚持正确意见的反受到打击。白泉村农会主席在讨论借地会上，他提了不该借到圪堆上，结果被一部分野心分子打击，当场驱逐出会，领导上当时内心谁也认为该干部冤曲，却没有坚持原则，片面的认为是“群众路线”，结果使错斗中农和地主富农没有得到补偿和安置。（二）村干部的抵触情绪，找借口说没法安置。西窑支书说：“我原来就不通，又见别村也没安置，我也就没做，又害怕别人说我，又是抢先办事。”三泉村长说：“我怕丢脸，过去斗争了他，现在给他借地，地主还好说，错斗中农更难办，我用的办法是干部不出头，让地多的户种不了的坏地给他借些就算了。”西喂马生产委员说：“俺村穷没有东西，没法安置。”总之都是寻找理由不补偿安置，甚至有的说：“不安置亦饿不死，去年七月扫地出门了，现在还活着哩！”在讨论为啥安置地主时，在口头上都说可以，但在具体解决时，便又提出一大堆困难。有的说村里没有果实地，有的说借出的地已经下种了、上粪了。还有的说我们好通，群众打不通怎办？工作组反复讲解安置地主富农，使他劳动生产，对咱农民也有利。接着又讨论了一些具体安置办法：如停止对被斗户强管制，允许自由生产自由行动，可以参加互助组，地主富农女人可以自由结婚，任何人不得强迫限制，供给二石产粮的土地，不准有要饭吃的，不准有义务劳动，不准有特殊工资的规定，保证不饿死一个人等。用各种办法使他们能生活，给他们找到地种。
    为了加强领导，原来五个领导生产干部，从填补时抽了五个，组成五个小组，进行检查，规定五日汇报，十日总结。（一区生产组、刘锋整理）
