　　What are the five conditions for class comparison in Shili Village?
　　Editor:

    In the People's Daily on March 13th, in the news about class division in Shili Village, it said that comparison should only be made on five conditions, and not on lifestyle, history, or "getui" (a derogatory term referring to someone who is miserly or stingy); what are these "five conditions"? Also, why does it say that the classification of new middle peasants should be based on the situation in 1928?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Zhang Yangnian Yangnian:

    The "five conditions" that Shili Village mentioned during the initial class division refer to: (1) Do they have land? How much? (2) Do they have livestock? (3) Do they have farm tools, and are they complete? (4) Do they have fertilizer and seeds, and are they sufficient? Besides farm tools, do they have other large production tools (such as cotton gins, looms, etc.)? How much sideline capital do they have? (5) On balance, is the income more than the expenditure in a year? Are they accumulating debt? Do they sell labor? If they don't sell labor or engage in arduous sideline occupations, is it enough to make a living? Among these five conditions, the first and fifth conditions are the most important. These five conditions are for distinguishing between middle peasants and poor peasants. As for distinguishing between new middle peasants and middle peasants, the situation in 1928 should be considered because the democratic government in Shili Village was only established in 1930. If someone was a poor or hired peasant in 1928 and has now become a middle peasant, then they are a new middle peasant; if someone was a middle peasant in 1928 and is still a middle peasant, then they are still a middle peasant.

### 什里店划阶级比的五个条件是什么？

　　什里店划阶级比的五个条件是什么？编辑同志：
    三月十三日人民日报载什里店划阶级新闻里，说要比只能比五个条件，不能比生活、比历史、比圪堆；这“五个条件”是什么？还有，其中为什么说划新中农的成份要看二十八年的情况？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者张羊年羊年同志：
    什里店初划阶级时所说的“五个条件”是指：（一）有土地没有？有多少？（二）有牲口没有？（三）农具有没有，齐全不齐全？（四）肥料、种子有没有，够用不够用？除了农具以外还有别的大件生产家具（如轧花机，织布机等）没有？有多少副业资本？（五）满打满算一年进的多出的多？垒饥荒（债务）不垒？出卖劳力不出卖？不出卖劳力或不经营艰苦副业够生活不够？这五个条件里，第一、第五两条件是最主要的条件，这五个条件是为区别中农、贫农的。至于区分新中农和中农时要按二十八年的情形，是因为什里店民主政权是二十九年才建立的。二十八年是贫雇农现在成了中农，就是新中农；二十八年是中农，一直还是中农，就仍是中农。
