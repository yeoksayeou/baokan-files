Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th: The Jizhong Hejian Democratic Government recently issued loans of 200 million yuan to help 26 industrial and commercial businesses in the city, which were robbed by the bandit Fu last month on the 15th, to resume operations. It also appropriately reduced the industrial and commercial taxes for all robbed households by half a year. Farmers in the city who suffered from robbery, arson, and killings by the bandits have been provided with low-interest loans and clothing by the government to help them quickly resume agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 4th: In conjunction with land reform and party rectification, various agencies in Jizhong have carried out household cleanup work and have achieved preliminary results. The leading agencies at the Jizhong Administrative Office level organized a working team of 120 people in early March and sent them to various counties to assist in the cleanup. They also educated the new village farmers' associations and poor peasants' leagues, mobilizing all farmers to report the amount of public goods stored, and to report phenomena such as hiding, privately borrowing public funds, and corruption, waste, and theft. Some places learned about the expenditure of various agencies from accounting, such as whether there were overspending and waste, where these overspending and waste came from, and then according to the source, they understood the original and current numbers, and the whereabouts of surplus materials. According to incomplete statistics, the grain cleaned and stored in Raoyang, Gaocheng, Luancheng, Qingcangjiao, Renqiu and other counties alone reached more than 1.1 million jin, more than 300 million yuan in border currency, and a large number of military equipment, cloth, bedding, medicines and other important equipment. At the same time, many financial chaos were also discovered, such as the misappropriation of village funds, corruption, theft, retention of public grain by agencies, and unauthorized use of public grain. In Renqiu County alone, the misappropriated public grain reached 320,000 jin. After this preliminary cleanup, cadres at all levels strengthened their sense of responsibility for managing public property. At the moment, the Jizhong Administrative Office and other agencies have also begun to register their household affairs, and are checking the stored items separately.
