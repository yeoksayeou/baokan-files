　　Decisions on Disciplinary Measures for Party Members Must Be Approved by Higher-Level Party Committees

Editor:
    After reading the news report on the Party rectification in Hexi, Wu'an, published on April 4th, it was mentioned that at the conclusion of the Party rectification, the branch studied the opinions raised by the masses regarding disciplinary actions for Party members and then announced the disciplinary measures for the Party members. I wonder if this was done with the approval of the higher-level Party committee. In the article "How Xin Village, Huguan, Conducted the Party Rectification Democratic Movement" on April 24th, it was mentioned that at the end of the Party rectification, the peasant representative assembly assessed and reviewed Party members and announced disciplinary measures for Party members. There was no mention of whether this was discussed and decided by the branch and approved by the higher-level Party committee. Is it appropriate for the peasant representative assembly to discipline Party members in this way? At the same time, I have recently seen many news reports about Party rectification where Party members need to undergo self-reflection and be approved to join the Poor Peasants' League. This approach is also mentioned in "Some Experiences in the Pilot Party Rectification and Democratic Supplementation Movement in the Ninth District of Wu'an." Does this imply that the requirements for members of the Poor Peasants' League are higher than those for Party members? If someone doesn't pass the Poor Peasants' League, does that mean they are not qualified to be a Party member?

Comrade Lù Fāng:
    We believe that the questions you raise are very important and involve matters of principle. It would be serious tailism and a violation of the Party Constitution if the work team did not lead such an important matter as deciding on disciplinary actions for Party members, did not seek approval from the higher-level Party, and allowed the masses to handle it casually. It would be an even more fundamental error to lower the Party's position to be inferior to that of the Poor Peasants' League, the Peasants' Association, or the Peasant Representative Assembly. If they are doing things this way, then they are completely wrong. Therefore, after receiving your letter, we immediately sent letters to the Wu'an Ninth District Work Team and the Huguan Xin Village Work Group based on your opinions, asking them to respond to your questions based on their understanding of their leadership and how they specifically conducted the work. Except for the reply from Xin Village, which will be reported after the letter arrives, we now present a summary of the reply from the Wu'an Ninth District Work Team as follows:

    "...In the Party rectification, we adhered to the Central Bureau's guidelines of combining intra-Party struggle with mass criticism, combining the Party branch's general meeting with the mass representative assembly, and combining strict correction of errors with enthusiastic pointing out of the way forward, to achieve the goal of education and transformation. Our approach is: We begin by explaining the significance of democratic Party rectification in the village, first making ideological preparations for both Party members and the masses, and then allowing the masses to fully express their opinions about Party members, and electing representatives to participate in branch Party rectification. Because rural branch Party members have long been detached from mass supervision and have an extremely undemocratic style, offending the masses, the opinions raised by the masses are often motivated by indignation, and the opinions raised are not necessarily all correct or consistent with the facts. Therefore, the Party members are then allowed to reflect on the opinions raised by the masses. After repeated revisions to clarify the right and wrong and the degree of responsibility, the work team drafts a preliminary opinion on disciplinary measures for Party members based on this, and then seeks opinions on whether the severity of the disciplinary measures for Party members is appropriate, and at the same time requests approval from the higher-level Party committee before making the final disciplinary decision.

    Why should the decision to discipline Party members be made by the branch and approved by the higher-level Party committee, and not by the masses or the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasant Representative Assembly directly? The reason is very clear. Our experience proves that the opinions of the Party and the masses are generally consistent, but not necessarily completely the same, because the opinions of the masses are not necessarily all correct. For example, the masses' understanding of the standards for Party members is sometimes based on human nature. For example, the Party members who they can initially approve are often those who are silent, inactive, and do not offend anyone, and whose political awareness is very poor. The masses consider such Party members to be good people; but from the perspective of the qualifications of Party members, such Party members sometimes have no or unstable class stand. Therefore, the 'good people' recognized by the masses do not necessarily meet the qualifications of good Party members. Sometimes the masses may think that a certain Party member has no mistakes (for example, they have not offended the masses), but the Party sees that there is a problem (for example, they have not done anything). But there are also opposite situations, where the Party does not see the mistake as a big deal, but some of the masses are dissatisfied with him. The work team should be clear about this, adhere to the Party's principles, and persuade and educate the masses. It is not permissible to blindly cater to the masses regardless of whether the masses' opinions are correct, to run around blindly following the masses without principles, or to allow the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasant Representative Assembly to directly discipline Party members. All of these are tailism and are abandoning the Party's leadership and violating the Party's organizational principles. The Party rectification work in the Ninth District of Wu'an is all done in this way, and so is Hexi, but because they were careless when writing the article, they omitted the process of Party committee approval. The approving authority for disciplinary measures for Party members is the higher-level Party committee, not the Peasant Representative Assembly. This is the only organizational principle stipulated in the Party Constitution, and there can be no other.

    Furthermore, does the fact that Party members participate in the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association and are approved by the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association mean that the requirements for members of the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association are higher than those for Party members? That is not what we mean by doing that. At this time, the Party rectification has not yet ended, and it is not known whether they are qualified to be Party members, but they can first be allowed to participate in the peasants' own organizations—the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association—to allow the masses to examine whether they are qualified to be members of the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association. Even if they are qualified to be members of the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association, whether they are qualified to be a Party member will be decided at the end of the Party rectification. But in any case, the qualifications for a Party member are naturally much higher than the qualifications for a member of the Poor Peasants' League or the Peasants' Association, so many places' Poor Peasants' Leagues and Peasants' Associations hope that Party members will participate and lead them, and good Party members are all absorbed to participate..."

### 决定党员处分须经上级党委批准

　　决定党员处分须经上级党委批准编辑同志：
    看了四月四日报载武安河西整党消息，在整党结束时，支部研究了群众提出处分党员的意见后，就宣布了党员的处分，不知是否经过上级党委批准。四月二十四日“壶关辛村怎样进行整党民主运动的”一文中，整党最后，由农代会鉴定审查党员，宣布党员处分，也未提是否经支部讨论决定和上级党委批准，这样由农代会处分党员是否适当？同时最近看到不少整党消息，党员要进贫农团得去反省通过才能参加，“武安九区试行整党、民主填补运动的点滴经验”中也是这样提法。这样做是否认为贫农团团员的条件比党员还要高？假如贫农团通不过，则是否这个人还够个党员的资格？　　读者　陆方陆方同志：
    你提的问题我们认为很重要，是有关原则性的问题。决定党员处分这样重要的事情，工作团不去领导，不请示上级党批准，任凭群众随便处理，那就是严重的尾巴主义，违犯了党章的规定。把党降低到不如贫农团、农会、农代会的地位，那更是原则错误。如果他们照这样做，那就完全错了。因之，我们在接到你的信后，随即根据你的意见，分函武安九区工作团及壶关辛村工作组，请他们根据自己领导是怎样认识的，和在工作中是怎样具体进行的，答复你提出的问题，除辛村答复俟来信后再告外，兹将武安九区工作团复信摘要如次：
    “……在整党中处分党员，我们是坚持了中央局所规定的党内斗争与群众批评，支部党员大会同群众代表大会相结合，严格纠正错误与热情指出出路相结合，达到教育改造之目的的方针。我们的做法是：开始到村讲明民主整党意义，先让党员与群众都做思想准备，然后让群众对党员尽情提意见，选举代表参加支部整党。由于过去农村支部党员长期脱离群众监督，作风极不民主，得罪了群众，因此群众提意见时，往往激于义愤，提的意见不一定都正确，也不一定都合事实，因之，再让党员根据群众所提意见进行反省。这样反复几次的订正，把是非轻重责任分清后，工作团即据此拟出对党员处分的初步意见，再征求党员处分轻重恰当与否，同时请求上级党委批准，这才做出最后处分决定。
    为什么处分党员要由支部决定，上级党委批准，不能让群众或贫农团、农代会直接处分党员呢？道理很明白，我们的经验证明，党和群众的意见，大体上是一致的，但不一定完全相同，因为群众的意见不一定都是正确的，如群众对党员标准的认识，有的是从人性论出发。比如他们第一次能通过的党员中往往有的是不吭气，不起作用，任何人也不得罪，政治觉悟很差的人。这样的党员，群众认为是好人；但从党员的条件看来，这样的党员有时是没有或站不稳阶级立场，因此群众认为的‘好人’，不一定都够得上好党员。有时群众认为某个党员也许没啥错误（比如说没得罪过群众），但党看来却是有问题的（比如说没有做什么事）。但也有相反的情形，在党看来不是了不起的错误，而某些群众却对他不满意。这点，工作团应该清醒，坚持党的原则，说服教育群众。不能不办群众意见正确与否，盲目的迁就群众，无原则的跟着群众乱跑，或由贫农团、农代会直接处分党员，这都是尾巴主义，都是放弃了党的领导，违犯了党的组织原则的。武安九区整党工作，都是这样做的，河西也是这样，不过由于他们写稿时疏忽，把党委批准的过程丢掉了。党员处分的批准机关是上级党委而不是农代会，这是党章上规定的唯一的组织原则，决不能再有其他。
    再则，党员参加贫农团、农会，由贫农团农会通过，是否贫农团团员和农会会员比党员条件还高呢？我们那样做并不是这个意思。这时整党尚未结束，够不够党员还不知道，但可以先让他们参加农民自己的组织——贫农团或农会，让群众审查他们够不够贫农团团员或农会会员，即便他们够上个贫农团团员或农会会员，够不够一个党员，还待整党结束时再来决定。但不管怎样，一个党员条件，自然比一个贫农团团员或农会会员的条件高得多，所以许多地方的贫农团、农会都希望党员参加，领导他们，好的党员都被吸收参加了……。”——编者
