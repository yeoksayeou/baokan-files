　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: Yan'an is rapidly recovering. Within five days of the recapture, all twenty-nine puppet "Bao" and "Gong" offices, comprising two hundred and eighteen "Jia", were automatically dissolved. Those puppet "Baojia" personnel who had been coerced by the Hu bandits and had gone astray have voluntarily registered with our government to confess their guilt and start anew. The district governments have been formally established and are operating in succession, and the villages have also restored democratic power. Transportation in Yan'an has also been restored, and cars can travel directly to Luochuan and Suide. The outer trench fortifications and barbed wire, etc., built by the Hu bandits around the city, have been filled in and destroyed. Over a thousand landmines buried by the Hu bandits have been cleared, and clearing is still continuing. More than five hundred shops, workshops, and stalls throughout the city, which had been forced to close due to looting by the Hu bandits, are resuming business one after another. The department stores in the large market are moving out the valuable goods that had been "fortified" during the bandit occupation, and merchants are flocking to Yichuan, Luochuan, and other places to procure goods. Grain from Luochuan and @ County has been arriving in Yan'an in succession. The price of millet has fallen more than five times compared to when the bandits occupied the city. Residents have begun to repair houses and shops, and various agencies and schools are busy renovating. Yan'an's First Elementary School has been repaired and classes have resumed. The enemy's filthy slogans in the city have been completely painted over, and the new slogans written by the masses have been refreshed. The Yan'an Municipal Government is now working to improve various organizations, actively restore industry and commerce, and organize farmers for spring plowing.
