【Taiyue News】According to a letter from Comrade Song Changfa of the Taiyue Fourth District Committee Working Group of the Chinese Communist Party: The correction of deviations in some villages in Gaoping has not yet begun, especially the left-leaning deviations regarding landlords and rich peasants. His letter stated: "When I arrived at Huojia Village, I saw that the village was still the same as before. The masses dared not speak, and production morale was very low. The reason was that they were afraid of disrupting the equal distribution and becoming rich, and they were uneasy. Can this be blamed on the masses? No, this is caused by the cadres, because this village is still forcing 'struggle targets' to eat their own food and organize them into groups to work for the village cooperative. Recently, a 'struggle target' in Seping Village starved to death because he could not work for the cooperative due to lack of labor. His family had no food, and he was not allowed to be given food or drink by the masses, nor was he allowed to go out to beg. He just starved to death like that."
(Editor's note: The Central Bureau clearly pointed out in its instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee: "Your saying that you will first unseal the property of middle peasants who have been swept out, and then unseal the property of landlords and rich peasants, instead of handling them simultaneously, is wrong and is preparing to starve some people to death..." Was the starvation in Gaoping caused by such erroneous thinking? The Gaoping County Party Committee should immediately conduct an inspection and immediately correct the deviations in accordance with the spirit of the Central Bureau's instructions. They should go to the countryside themselves and set an example, just like the Yangcheng County Party Committee, and should not delay any longer.)

### 塞平“管制”尚未取消　无偿劳动竟致饿死人

　　塞平“管制”尚未取消
  　无偿劳动竟致饿死人
    【太岳消息】据中共太岳四地委工作团宋长法同志来信说：高平有些村庄纠正偏向还没着手，特别是对于地主富农的左倾偏向。他来信说：“我到了霍家庄，看到村里还和过去一样，群众不敢说话，生产情绪很低，原因是怕打乱平分，怕发财，不安心，这能怨群众吗？不能，这是干部造成的，因为这村眼前还在强迫‘斗争对象’吃自己的饭，编成组为村合作社劳动。最近塞平村饿死一个‘斗争对象’因他无劳动不能为合作社作工，家里没吃的，又不许群众给他吃喝，也不许出外讨饭，就这样饿死了。”
    （编者按：中央局在给太岳区党委指示中明确指出“你们说先启封被扫地出门的中农财产，然后再启封地主富农财产，而不是同时处理的办法是错误的，是准备饿死一部分人的。……”高平是否是在这样错误的思想下把人饿死了呢？高平县委应立即检查，并立即按照中央局指示精神来进行纠偏。应象阳城县委那样亲自下乡，作出样子来，丝毫不应再加拖延。）
