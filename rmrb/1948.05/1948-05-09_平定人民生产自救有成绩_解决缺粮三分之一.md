　　Pingding People Achieve Success in Production for Self-Relief
  　Resolves One-Third of Grain Shortage
    [Pingding News] Pingding experienced a widespread poor harvest last year, with only 30% of a normal year's yield for the entire county. The most severely affected areas, districts one, two, five, six, four, and seven, had over fifty deserted villages (caused by Yan Xishan's bandits), involving over ten thousand households and sixty thousand people. Last year, the average actual harvest per person was around three *dou* of coarse grains. More than half of the county's population of over 100,000 people went hungry. To address this serious issue, county-level leaders established a Production and Disaster Relief Committee, distributing 550 *shi* of interest-free loans in grain to help resolve problems relating to production tools and various difficulties. In early March, the county committee convened a meeting of central group leaders from each district to study the integration of production relief with democratic land redistribution, drawing a large number of personnel from the land redistribution movement to focus on the central task of production relief. From top to bottom, spring plowing production and disaster relief committees were established, distributing 300 *shi* of relief grain and 38 million *yuan* in loans to resolve specific difficulties in spring plowing production, such as seeds and farm tools. At the same time, based on the different production conditions in each district and village, further organization and leadership were provided to the masses to carry out a production movement combining agriculture and sideline occupations. Last winter, when organizing the masses for transportation, transportation stations were established in Baijing in the seventh district, Shu Hui in the eighth district, Yingzhuang and Ceyu in the ninth district, Songta in the third district, and Zanhuang City and Xuting to specifically handle the coal transported by the masses, allowing them to gain significant benefits from November last year to February this year. As a result of continued efforts for the past three months from February to the present, the masses have gained even greater benefits. In districts one, six, and seven alone, the masses earned 14 million *yuan* in freight charges for transporting rice and wheat, equivalent to 230 *shi* of millet. In districts two, five, and the urban district, transporting rice for the state-owned Wanxing Company earned 4.3 million *yuan*. Wanxing Company also used over 32.2 million *yuan* in capital to purchase copper in large quantities, allowing the masses to earn over 11 million *yuan*. Transporting rice for the Yangquan state-owned store (carrying coal and iron on the return trip to cover round-trip expenses) resulted in a net profit of over 15 million *yuan* in freight charges. In addition, the county's saltpeter bureau lent out some rice as capital to organize the masses in boiling saltpeter. From last winter to the present, a mass-based, self-created (without hiring technical workers, creating it themselves) movement of boiling saltpeter in every village has developed. In the third district, 32 natural villages have developed one or two pots for boiling saltpeter in each village. Most villages in the fourth district are boiling saltpeter, and there are also 15 villages in districts one, two, five, and six doing so. Last October, there were more than ten saltpeter pots; now, there are more than sixty, with sixty to seventy workers developed. In total, over 35,000 *jin* of saltpeter were produced last year, earning over 320,000 *jin* of rice. The districts and villages that can boil saltpeter have resolved significant difficulties. In the coal, iron, and mining industries, a sales channel was found last winter to have the Taihang Military Industry Department purchase 1 million *jin* of pig iron. The government issued 510 *shi* of industrial loan grain to the villages in districts one, two, and six that can develop industry and mining and are the most severely affected by famine, lending it to truly poor households without labor as investment capital to develop industry and mining. Last November, there were eight original pig iron furnaces in Badao Hao; now, there are 38, with 418 workers, completing 1 million *jin* of pig iron, which was exchanged for 1 million *jin* of millet (sixteen iron pot furnaces, with 244 workers; profits not yet calculated). After the Military Industry Department stopped purchasing pig iron, in order to completely overcome the famine, each village developed wrought iron furnaces. The pig iron was turned into wrought iron and farm tools and sold to Yangquan, Hebei, and other places. Forty-four "foreign stick" furnaces have now been developed, producing a total of 520,000 *jin* of "foreign sticks," which were exchanged for 725,000 *jin* of millet. In addition, 69 farm tool furnaces were developed, producing a total of 491,000 *jin* of hoe blades, shovels, plows, strip iron, etc., selling for over 160 million *yuan*. With the development of pig iron furnaces, coal, charcoal, sulfur, and gangue kilns have also greatly developed. In districts one and two, there were 21 coal and charcoal kilns, with 280 workers; now, there are 24, with 348 workers. In four months, they earned 892 *shi* of rice. There are now 41 sulfur kilns, with 253 workers, and 25 gangue kilns, with 130 workers. In four months, they earned 1,149 *shi* of rice. In this way, the masses in areas with industry and mining have also resolved significant problems. Poor and hired laborers without labor have been provided with food for three to six months.

    The above transportation, saltpeter boiling, and industrial and mining production, from last November to the present, based on existing figures alone, have earned a total of 21,888 *shi* of rice (including the cost of coal, charcoal, sulfur, gangue, and converting profits into rice). In addition to small-scale peddling, workers going out to work, and various productions such as household sideline occupations and small handicrafts, the county's grain shortage can be reduced by one-third, and the production enthusiasm of the masses has greatly increased. Currently, efforts are being made to actively combine agriculture and sideline occupations to overcome the famine through production.

　　平定人民生产自救有成绩
  　解决缺粮三分之一
    【平定消息】平定去年普遍歉收，全县不足三成年景，最严重的一、二、五、六、四、七区，有五十多个无人村（阎匪造成），一万余户，六万余口人。去年每人平均实收杂粮三斗上下，挨饿的人占全县十万多人口的二分之一以上。县级领导上为解决这一严重的问题，成立生产救灾委员会，发放无利贷粮五百五十石，解决生产工具和各种困难。三月初，县委召开各区中心小组长会议，研究生产救灾与民主填补的结合，由填补运动中抽出大批力量，转向生产救灾的中心工作。从上而下成立了春耕生产救灾委员会，发放救济粮三百石，贷款三千八百万元，解决春耕生产中的种子、农具等具体困难。同时依据各区村不同生产条件，进一步组织与领导群众开展农副业结合的生产运动。去冬组织群众运输时，曾在七区柏井，八区束回、九区营庄、测鱼、三区松塔及赞皇城、许亭等地成立运输站，专门吞吐群众运输的煤炭，使群众从去年十一月至今年二月获得很大利。二月以后到现在三个月中继续搞的结果，群众获利更大。仅一、六、七区群众运米麦即赚脚价一千四百万元，小米二百三十石。二、五、城关区给公营商店万兴号运米赚洋四百三十万元，万兴号并用三千二百二十多万元资本大批买铜，群众得利一千一百多万元。给阳泉公营商店运米（下去捎上炭铁，能够来回盘费）净赚脚洋一千五百余万元。另外，由县硝磺局借出一部分米作资本，组织群众熬硝，从去冬到现在发展了群众性的自创的（不请技术工人，自己硬创）村村熬硝。三区三十二个自然村，每村都发展了一、二口锅熬硝。四区大部村庄都在熬硝，一、二、五、六区也有十五个村熬硝。去年十月硝锅十多口，现在发展到六十多口，发展工人六、七十名。连去年总共产硝三万五千多斤，赚米三十二万多斤。这样能熬硝的区村解决了很大困难。在煤铁工矿业上，去冬开始找到太行区军工部收买一百万斤生铁的销路。政府对一、二、六区能开展工矿业和灾荒最严重的村庄发放工业贷粮五百一十石，贷给各村真正贫苦无劳力户作为入股资本，开展了工矿业。去年十一月份原有生炉八道壕，现在发展到三十八道壕，工人四百一十八个，完成了一百万斤生铁，换回小米一百万斤，（铁锅炉十六道壕，工人二百四十四个，得利未统计）。军工部停止收生铁后，为彻底渡过灾荒，各村又开展了熟铁炉。由生铁变成熟铁和农具，向阳泉、河北等地推销。现在已经发展起四十四盘洋棍炉，共产出洋棍五十二万斤，换回小米七十二万五千斤。又发展农具炉六十九座，共出锄板、锹、铧、条铁等四十九万一千斤，卖洋一万万六千多万元。随着生铁炉的开展，煤、炭、磺、矸窑也大大发展了。一、二区煤、炭窑二十一座，工人二百八十人，现在发展到二十四座，工人三百四十八个。四个月赚米八百九十二石。磺窑现在发展到四十一座，工人二百五十三个，矸窑二十五座，工人一百三十个，四个月赚米一千一百四十九石。这样，有工矿业地区群众也解决了很大问题。贫雇无劳力户已经安置住三个月至半年的食用。
    以上运输、熬硝、工矿业等生产，从去年十一月至现在，仅现有数字，共赚米二万一千八百八十八石（包括煤、炭、磺、矸各种成本，赚钱的也折成米）。再加上担挑小商、出外工人、及家庭副业和小手工业等各种生产，能减少全县缺粮数三分之一，群众生产情绪大为提高。现正农副业结合，积极生产渡荒。（平定联合办公室、职工会及县政府通讯组）
