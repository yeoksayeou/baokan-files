　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS, Moscow, reports: The "Moscow Bolshevik Newspaper" recently published a detailed article entitled "On the Other Side of the Pyrenees," discussing the current situation in Spain, stating: "The terrible years of the Spanish fascist dictatorship began after Colonel Casado abandoned Madrid and surrendered to Franco in March 1939. Franco, who proclaimed himself the 'Head of State' of Spain, surpassed his teachers, Hitler and Mussolini, turning a prosperous country into a torture chamber."

　　However, after the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) abandoned Madrid, it quickly organized a resistance movement using secret committees. The people's belief in the Communist Party and the prestige the PCE won through its heroic struggle against German, Italian, and Spanish fascists mobilized Spanish workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals to fight against Franco. The mountainous areas have now become strongholds of the guerrilla movement, which Franco's troops cannot penetrate. In less than a year, the guerrillas carried out more than 700 acts of sabotage, disrupting railways from Andalusia, Galicia, and other mountains, destroying arsenals, eliminating notorious Falangist bandits, and fighting against punitive expeditions.

　　Franco's rule has brought disaster to Spain's economic life, with an economic crisis of unprecedented severity. Franco's entire economic policy is aimed at enriching a small number of capitalists, feudal aristocrats, and the Catholic Church. Since Franco's rebellion in 1936, the cost of living in Spain has increased fivefold, while workers' wages have remained at previous levels. Taxes on the people are constantly increasing, with a recent increase of 25 percent. Inflation and economic chaos have made the people's lives extremely miserable. In the cities, the poor can only survive on wild chestnuts.

　　It is only because the United States, Britain, and France have disregarded the resolutions of Potsdam and the various sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, and actively expanded their trade with Franco, transfusing Franco's economy with dollars and gold pounds, that Franco, who was already shaken by domestic resistance movements and the economic crisis, has been able to temporarily maintain his position. In 1947, the proportion of British and American trade in Spain's total foreign trade accounted for more than 50 percent. The United States supplied Franco with grain, oil, and industrial equipment, attempting to control Spain's basic industries. To date, the United States has controlled the textile industry, bells, telephones, aviation, automobiles, transportation, fuel supply, and automobile and tire production in Catalonia, and is also establishing control over railways and ports. British capital controls Spain's steel and mining industries. According to Workers' Daily figures, Franco's trade exports to Britain exceeded imports by 20 million pounds in 1947. Franco used the proceeds from this trade surplus to increase imports of machinery from Britain.

　　Domestically, Franco is supported by right-wing Socialists and anarchists. The right-wing Socialist Prieto has openly declared that he is more anti-communist than Franco. Due to the growth of the domestic people's resistance movement, Spanish reactionaries are intensifying their collusion with the likes of Prieto to oppose the People's Front.

　　However, the conspiracies of the Spanish opposition and their foreign supporters have been shattered by reality. The people's resistance movement is growing stronger, and the influence and prestige of the Spanish Communist Party are increasing, because it has proven itself to be the party of resistance, the party that steadfastly fights for the freedom of the people, for the Republic, and for the independence of Spain. The Republican radio station "Pyrenees" recently reported that guerrillas are actively operating in Castile, Andalusia, Aragon, and Galicia, and the scale of the guerrilla warfare has forced Franco to send large armies, artillery, and even the air force to fight. The indomitable Spanish freedom-loving people are continuing their struggle.

　　西班牙人民战斗不歇
  　英勇反抗佛朗哥匪帮
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】莫斯科塔斯社讯：此间“莫斯科布尔什维克报”最近以“比利牛斯山的那一边”为题，详论西班牙的现状称：从一九三九年三月卡萨多上校放弃马德里投降佛朗哥之后，西班牙法西斯独裁的可怖年月就开始了。自封为西班牙“元首”的佛朗哥，超过了他的老师们——希特勒和墨索里尼，他把繁荣的国家变成了刑讯室。
    但是，西班牙共产党在马德里被放弃后，即迅速利用秘密委员会组织抵抗运动，人民对共产党的信念以及西共在反对德意与西班牙法西斯的英勇斗争而赢得的威信，将西班牙工人、农民与进步知识分子动员了起来，进行反佛朗哥的斗争，山区现在已变成了游击运动的据点，而佛朗哥的部队则无法进去。在不到一年中间，游击队进行了七百余次的破击他们从安达卢西亚、卜里西亚等山下来往的铁路，炸毁兵工厂，消灭著名的长枪党匪徒，并与讨伐队作战。
    佛朗哥的统治，给西班牙经济生活带来了灾难，经济危机之严重，前所未有。佛朗哥的全部经济政策，是在于使极少数资本家、封建贵族与天主教会致富。自一九三六年佛朗哥叛乱以来，西班牙生活费用增加了五倍，而职工的薪资则仍滞留于以前的水平，对人民的课税不断地增长着，仅在最近即增加了百分之二十五。通货膨胀与经济混乱，使人民的生活极端低劣。在城市中，穷人只能靠野栗子过活。
    只是由于美英法对波茨顿与联合国大会历届大会的决议弃置不顾，并积极扩展他们与佛朗哥的贸易，以美元和金镑为佛朗哥经济输血，这才使早被国内人民抵抗运动与经济危机所震撼的佛朗哥，得以暂时保持其地位。一九四七年，英美在西班牙全部对外贸易中的比重占百分之五十以上。美国以谷类、石油与工业装备供应佛朗哥，当时力图控制西班牙的基本工业。迄今为止，美国已控制了加泰隆尼亚的纺织工业、钟锣、电话、航空、汽车、运输、燃料供应以及汽车与车胎的生产，而对铁道与港口的控制亦在建立中。英国资本则控制着西班牙的钢铁与矿业。据工人日报数字，一九四七年佛朗哥对英贸易输出超过输入两千万镑。佛朗哥就以此种出超的收益，增加自英国输入机械。
    在国内，佛朗哥得到右派社会党与无政府主义者的撑腰，右派社会党人普利多曾公开宣布他比佛朗哥还要反共。由于国内人民抵抗运动的增长，西班牙反动派正加紧与普利多之流勾结一起，反对人民阵线。
    但是，西班牙反对派与他们的外国支持者的阴谋，却被现实粉碎了。人民的抵抗运动正日益加强，西共的影响与威信正在增涨，因为它已证明是进行抵抗的党，是坚持不渝地为人民自由、为共和国、为西班牙独立而战斗的党。共和广播电台“庇兰内加”最近报导游击队在卡斯提里亚、安达卢西亚、亚拉岗与加里西亚等地正积极活动，游击战的规模迫使佛朗哥派遣大军、炮兵甚至空军前往作战。不屈不挠的西班牙爱好自由人民，在继续他们的斗争。
