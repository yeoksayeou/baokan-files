Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th—Various shops and vendors in Weixian City have successively resumed business, and the market is becoming increasingly active. War relics on the streets have been cleared, and several city gates blocked by the Japanese puppets, Chiang Kai-shek bandits for more than ten years have been completely opened. Farmers from the outskirts bring fresh vegetables into the city every day, and merchants from surrounding counties come to Weicheng in groups for trade. Hundreds of shops on Zhongshan Avenue and Dongguan Avenue, which run through the east and west of the city, have officially opened. The daily turnover of the famous Huidong Pharmacy Dongguan Branch, Yadong Pharmacy Fu Shou Tang, and Chinese medicine stores is several times higher than in the past. After the credit cooperative resumed business, its turnover exceeded three times that during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit rule. Many shoe stores, clothing stores, tailoring shops, and barber shops are renovating their storefronts while conducting business. The Shatan market opened on the 18th, with cloth, shoes, socks, ironware, porcelain, and food shops of all kinds. One cloth merchant traded nearly a thousand bolts of cloth in a single day.

    【新华社华东二十八日电】潍县城各种商店摊贩相继复业，市场日趋活跃。街道上战争遗迹均已扫除，被日伪蒋匪堵塞十余年之几处城门已完全开放，四郊农民每天挑鲜菜进城，四周各县商人纷纷结伴到潍城进行交易，横贯东关西城之中山大街与东关大街数百家商店均已正式开门，著名之惠东大药房东关支店、亚东大药房付寿堂及中药店每日营业额倍于往昔。信用商店复业后，营业超过蒋匪统治时期三倍。许多鞋店、服装店、成衣局、理发店均一面修饰门面，一面进行营业。十八日纱滩市场开市布匹、鞋袜、铁器、瓷器、食品小店，应有尽有，某布商一天中交易即近千匹。
