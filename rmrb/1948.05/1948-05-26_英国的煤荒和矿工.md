    Britain's Coal Shortage and Miners
    Liu Ningyi
    According to China's old "destiny studies," Britain's annual fortune is "lacking all five elements, cursed by the White Tiger." Among the five elements, the first to be discussed is "metal," lacking US dollars, lacking pounds, lacking hardware, lacking machinery. Therefore, it panics every day and when it concludes trade agreements with others, it can only ask them to deliver goods, while it cannot produce anything itself. Because it has no money, it is also afraid of taking the goods from others. The problem with "wood" is even more serious. It does not produce trees either, and the trees that do grow are all suitable for ancient Chinese paintings, crooked and useless, which makes building houses and making paper a problem. As for "water," it should certainly not be lacking, but on the other hand, there are not enough ships for shipping routes, so the United States is allowed to gradually encroach, and it will slowly be squeezed until it lacks water. "Fire" was originally abundant, the Great Fire of London in 1666 and the Great War fires were sufficient. But now the coal shortage is alarming, and it cannot be overcome, which leads to problems with gas, electricity, and everything else. "Earth" was eaten up by sheep and land enclosure three hundred years ago, and now Britain only has rotten stones and grassland. Lacking all five elements is already a "fate that is difficult to escape," but then comes Churchill and those like Churchill, which adds "cursed by the White Tiger."
    Some reactionary elements deliberately ignore the fundamental causes, yield to American imperialism, protect the big capitalists, discriminate against new democratic and socialist countries, and seek solutions by increasing retail taxes, reducing wages, reducing food, and intensifying labor. In order to truly understand the reasons for their poverty, I traveled a lot, met many people, and went down to a mine a thousand feet deep to see if it was the workers' responsibility.
    "Bring the troops back to dig coal," was the cry during a heavy snow last year. A year has passed, and it is said that there are still no fewer than 1.5 million troops stationed overseas, spending a lot of money. Before the war, the coal mines had one million miners, producing 240 million tons annually, but now there are only 717,000 miners. Moreover, the machinery has not been replaced since the war, the old are old, the broken are broken, the people are also old and sick, and the mines are deep and the tunnels are far away. Even so, the efficiency of coal production is still very high. This year, it can still reach 190 million tons. The coal miners' union has 660,000 members, and the general secretary is named Arthur Horner. He is a communist and a veteran coal miner from Wales. This union is a united front organization of workers of the Labor Party, the Communist Party, and various beliefs. Since the implementation of the five-day work week this May, the workers' production efficiency has further improved. The union pays close attention to workers' insurance, and large-scale fires and floods are rare. Now the coal mines are state-run, although the management agencies still retain the same people from the past, workers can participate in the production committee. For the sake of the people's fuel and the country's economic self-reliance, they are willing to make every effort to solve this difficulty. It is only a pity that there is a serious lack of manpower, and when it comes to digging coal, there are not enough people and the treatment is not good. When it comes to working, there is not enough strength, and the machinery is very insufficient, so there is no way to speed up. This attracted me to go to the coal mine to see for myself.
    On October 23rd, I arrived at the Northwest Basin Coal Mine in Cardiff, South Wales, where there are more than two hundred mines, now with 108,000 workers, compared to 250,000 before the war. This area is a series of rolling hills. It takes three and a half hours by train from London. The scenery along the way is not bad. Sheep are still grazing on the grass roots, and withered trees occupy the rolling hills. Occasionally, you can see a small vegetable garden, with a few bell-sized fruits still hanging on the thin tomato stems. Our train entered Cardiff station at six o'clock. We were unwilling to trouble people, so we simply found a hotel to stay overnight and look for the union tomorrow. But like other cities, the hotels were all full. My two friends and I ran for more than an hour in the autumn rain, asking at more than ten places, all of which refused. Camp out? It was raining again, so we had to turn back and return to the station, lamenting that we had wasted more than six pounds on train fare. In despair, we called the union to ask, fearing that we would not be able to find anyone so late. Fortunately, the director of the union's labor insurance department was there and found us a hotel, solving the problem.
    The coal mining area is still forty kilometers away from Cardiff. This is the area where coal miners have the most strength. Skilled workers account for 56 percent, and underground workers account for 60 percent, totaling 85,000 people. Their wages are divided into piecework and daily rates. Those on piecework can earn eight pounds and fourteen shillings a week, and those on daily rates can earn five pounds and twelve shillings. The overall average is four pounds and five shillings a week for those above ground and five pounds and thirteen shillings for those below ground. Workers' wages are divided into seven grades. Working hours are eight and a half hours above ground and seven and a half hours below ground, including getting in and out of the mine, it is also eight and a half hours. Working five days a week produces more coal than working six days before.
    The problem of labor insurance is much less than before the nationalization of the coal mines. According to last year's statistics, including serious injuries, there were about 10,000 people, an average of one injury for every ten people. Permanent disabilities occurred in two out of every hundred people. This means that mining is like fighting a war, with injuries and deaths every day. The so-called progress now is due to the union's constant negotiations with the mine owners. For example, on the issue of preventing large-scale fires and collapses, installing ventilation ducts, building supports, and injecting water into the coal seams. After a worker is injured, according to the general insurance law promulgated by the government, if the worker cannot work, he receives two pounds and five shillings a week, and his wife and children receive twenty-two shillings. The miners believe that this general approach is unfair, because miners are much more dangerous than any other workers. There are actually many obstacles to obtaining this insurance, and the union demands a supplementary approach, increasing the insurance money for each injured worker to four pounds, and clearly stipulating the age and conditions for retirement. The union also strictly supervises the equipment. If death is due to the worker's negligence, the mine owner compensates 400 pounds. If it is due to the mine owner's negligence, the compensation is 2,000 pounds, so that the capitalist cannot cut corners on equipment. All these demands for improvement are not because the miners want to be special, but because they want to make the miners more at ease in their production. Indeed, to this day, the British people are wary of becoming miners. Although today there are fewer machines and fewer people, the 108,000 workers in this area produced a total of 427,000 tons last week.
    On October 25th, Comrade Taurer took us down to the mine. We took electric lamps from the lamp room, changed into mine clothes, and drilled straight into the lower level of 1,000 feet from the coal-carrying tank. That was not the deepest point. After walking three li from the main entrance, the coal cars here were no longer pulled by horses, but by electric trolleys. The cars蠕动 ran to the mine, and the black-faced British men were still in the depths of the cave. We also bent over and drilled inward. From the main tunnel, we entered the stone gate, climbed on the revolving canvas, and slid into a small hole. There were more than twenty workers in the cave, sweating and wielding hoes, fighting in the five-foot-thick coal seam. We immediately joined the production. The coal was hard, large chunks, glittering, black, and resisting these people who wanted bread. The workers gritted their teeth and attacked the coal seam. They shoveled the coal onto the canvas, the canvas sent it to the car, the car sent it to the mine mouth, and the mine heard the bell, turned the switch, and the steam engine roared out white gas, hoisting the car up. Black British workers, gritting their teeth, pushed the car aside and dumped it into the train's box. The train sent it to the city to burn machines, burn gas, and warm the carved beams and painted rafters for the white-gloved people sitting on the sofas, and they would hold meetings there, proposing:
    "Coal miners work too short hours, they should work longer hours, reduce wages, increase prices, eliminate bread subsidies, and increase retail taxes to solve the economic crisis!"
    You can't hear anything or see anything in the mine. The electric light in front of you shines directly on the coal, and your ears are filled with the sound of the machines and the sound of digging coal. The sulfur gas, methane, and coal dust filled the air. The wind pressed down from the mine mouth was weakly sent to the end of the cave, filling people's lungs with black air. The miners didn't care about this. The coal is black, the flesh is black, everything is black, only the three shillings earned for digging a yard (nineteen-twentieths of a ton) is white. The spur of this wage drove them to forget fatigue and hygiene, forget parks and green grass. Every worker can dig out eight tons a day. Those who strike stones, build sheds, hold big drills, and manage machines are all for a day's wages, fighting desperately with their lives. Suddenly a friend said:
    "Don't forget, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, don't kill him, send him to dig coal."
    This proposal is good and can be applied to international law. Anyone who says that workers should not improve their lives should be sent to dig coal. Only in this way will they understand why workers oppose them, otherwise they will not understand until they die.
    The workers of all countries are one family, that's right. Everyone became acquainted at first sight. Sitting on the coal, they talked about each other's lives. They are concerned about the Chinese miners and the Chinese workers. They talked about their union history and the current situation. They swallowed bread in the foul air and sent it to their stomachs with cold water brought in bottles. We were going back, and we shook hands tightly with our black hands.
    We ate in the canteen run by the union above, and then embarked on our way back. A machine worker sent us to the bus station. The union leader repeatedly said that they would be responsible for all hotel expenses to show their hospitality. Their guest car approached the rolling town again, and drove on the misty highway. The small buildings on both sides stood quietly in rows, children playing and fighting in the streets, and the clothes dried in the courtyards were blown by the mountain wind beside the small pine branches. The housewives carried baskets to get some sweet potatoes and bread and returned home. This is probably the miners' residence. I know that the children's father is sweating under the ground where they are playing.
    The workers have put forth all their strength, but the coal is still not enough, the food is still not enough, everything is not enough. Are the 1.8 million or 1.5 million troops still in overseas colonies, and will American gold come like the London fog without any cost? (London, October 30, 1947)

　　英国的煤荒和矿工
    刘宁一
    若按中国的旧“命运学”讲来，英国的流年运是“五行都缺，白虎照命”。在五行之中，第一谈到“金”，缺美金、缺金镑、缺五金、缺机器。因而每天闹恐慌，和人家订商约，只能要求人家交货，自己拿不出东西。因为自己没有钱，又怕要人家的货。“木”的问题，更为严重。也不出树，所长的树全是适合于中国古画，歪歪曲曲不成材，这就使树盖房造纸都成问题了。至于谈到“水”，当然应该不缺，然而在另一方面，船只不够航路，只得让美国步步逼进，慢慢会挤得它缺了水。“火”本来是不少，一六六六年的伦敦大火二次，大战的大火很够了。但现在煤很恐慌，无法克服，这就引起瓦斯、电力一切成问题。“土”在三百年前就被羊连田带谷给吃光了，现在英国只有烂石头和草地。五行都缺，已经是“大数难逃”，却又来了邱吉尔和邱吉尔之流，这就加上“白虎照命”。
    有些反动分子故意把根本原因丢开，对美帝国主义退让，对大资本家保护，对新民主主义及社会主义国家歧视，而求解决之路，企图从增加零售税，减工资，减食物，加强劳动强度去着手。我为了真正了解其贫困原因，曾跑了很多路，会了很多人，亲自下到一千英尺深的矿井去看看，是否是工人的责任。
    “把军队调回来去挖煤”，这是去年一次大雪时的呼声。一年了，据谈现在驻扎在海外的部队还不缺一百五十万，钱花的很多。煤矿在战前有一百万矿工，年产二万四千万吨，现在只有七十一万七千矿工。而且机器又是从战争以来没有换过，旧的旧了，坏的坏了，人也是老的老了，病的病了，矿井也深了，洞子也远了。纵然如此，煤的生产效率还是很高。今年还可达一万九千万吨。煤矿工会会员有六十六万人，总书记名叫阿特·霍尔纳。他是一个共产党员，威尔斯煤矿的老工人。这一工会是工党、共产党及各种信仰的工人统一战线组织。自从今年五月实行每星期五天工作制之后，工人的生产效率更提高了。工会对于工人的保险很注意，大的透火透水是很少的。现在煤矿是国家经营，虽然管理机关还存留着过去的一班人，但工人可以参加生产委员会。他们为了人民的燃料，为了国家经济的自力更生，愿尽一切的努力解决这一困难。只可惜人力太缺乏，挖起煤来，人不够，待遇还不好。做起工来，还没有大劲，机器很不够，要加快也没办法。这样吸引着我一定到煤矿去看看。
    十月二十三日，我到了南威尔斯加梯夫的西北盆地煤矿，那里有两百多个矿井，现在有十万零八千工人，战前是二十五万人。这一带都是起伏不断的小山。从伦敦出发，要坐三个半钟头的火车。沿路的风景还不错。羊还啃着草根，枯黄的树木占着起伏的山地。偶尔可以看见一小片菜园，细弱的蕃茄茎上还挂着几颗铃铛大的果子。我们的车进了加梯夫站已经六点钟了。我们不愿意麻烦人，索性自己找一个旅馆住一夜，明天再找工会吧。哪晓得和其他城市一样，到处旅馆没有屋子。我和两位朋友在秋雨淋淋的街上跑了一个多钟头，问了十多家，一概拒绝了。露宿吗？又下雨，只好向后转，又回到车站，自叹白花了六镑多车费。在绝望当中，给工会打个电话问问，天晚了恐怕人也找不到。可巧工会劳动保险部的主任在那里，代替我们找了一个旅馆，解决了问题。
    煤矿区还离加梯夫有四十公里，是煤矿工人最有力量的一个区域，这里的工人，熟练工人占百分之五十六，井下工人占百分之六十，共八万五千人。他们的工资分为论件和论日。论件的每礼拜可拿到八镑十四个先令，论日的可拿到五镑十二个先令。总平均在井上的每礼拜四镑五个先令，在井下的五镑十三个先令。工人工资的差别分为七等。工作时间在井上的八个半钟头，在井下的七小时半，连上井下井也要八小时半。每礼拜做五天，比以前做六天出的煤还多。
    关于劳动保险的问题，比煤矿国营以前少的多了。去年一年的统计，重伤在内约一万人，平均每十人中一人受伤。永久残废的每百人中有二人。这就是说开矿如作战，伤亡日日有。现在所谓进步了，是由于工会不断的向矿方交涉。如对于预防大规模的透火和塌陷，装风筒，搭棚子，向煤层中灌水等问题。工人受伤后，根据政府公布的一般保险法，工人不能做工的，本人每礼拜两镑五个先令，老婆和小孩二十二先令。矿工认为这一普遍办法是不公平的，矿工比任何工人危险的多。这种保险，实际上还有很多阻碍，得不到，工会要求一个补充办法，并增加每一受伤工人保险金至四镑，并明确规定养老退休的年龄和条件。特别对于设备问题，工会更予以严格督促。如果是工人的疏忽，而至死亡，由矿方赔偿四百镑。如果是矿方疏忽，赔偿二千镑，使资方不能从设备上偷工、减料。这一切改善的要求，并不是因为要矿工特殊化，而是想使矿工更安心的进行生产。的确，直至今日，英国人民都以做矿工为畏途，虽然今天的机器少，人手少，而这一区十万零八千工人在上礼拜的生产总计就达四十二万七千吨。
    十月二十五日陶勒尔同志同我们到井下去。从电灯房带上电灯，换上窑衣，从载煤的罐上一直钻入了一千英尺的下层。那里还不是最深处，从大井口走进三华里的样子，这里的运煤车已经没有马拖的，都是电力拖车。车子蠕动的跑向井上，而英国的黑脸大汉还在洞的深处。我们也就半俯着腰往里钻。从总洞进了石门，爬在旋回的帆布上，一直溜到一个小洞里。洞里有二十多工人，流着汗，扬着锄，在五尺厚的煤层搏斗。我们随即参加了生产。那煤是坚硬的大块，亮晶晶，黑压压，张牙舞爪的向着这些要面包的人抵抗。工人们咬紧牙齿，向煤层进攻。把煤块用铁铲抛到那帆布上，帆布送到车子上，车子又送到井口，井上听到铃声，拨动开关，那蒸气机呼呼的吐出了白气，把车子吊上来。黑色英国工人，一咬牙齿，把车推到旁边，倒到火车的箱子里。火车就把它送到城里，烧机器、烧瓦斯，给坐在发沙上的白手套的人烘暖了雕梁画栋，他们就在那里开会，提出：
    “煤矿工人工作时间太短了，应该延长时间，减少工资，增加物价，取消面包津贴，增加零售税，以解决经济危机呵！”
    在井下是什么也听不到，什么也看不到。额前的电灯直射着煤，耳朵里塞满了机器的声音，挖煤的声音。那硫磺气瓦斯味，和煤的灰尘，充满了空气。从井口压下的风，微弱的送到这洞子的末尾，使人的肺腑充满着黑的空气。矿工们还是不在乎这一点。煤是黑的，肉也是黑的，一切是黑的，只有挖一码（一吨的二十分之十九），所得三个先令是白的。这工资的鞭策，驱使着他们忘记了疲劳与卫生，忘记了公园与绿草。每一个工人每天能挖出八吨。那打石头的，搭棚子的，掌大钻的，管机器的，也都是为了一天的工资。在紧张地与寿命搏斗。忽然一位朋友说：
    “不要忘记，活捉了蒋介石，千万不要杀掉，送他挖煤。”
    这个提议很好，可适用于国际公法。凡说工人不要改善生活的人，都应送他去挖煤。只有这样，他们才懂得为什么工人要反对他们，否则他们到死也不明白。
    各国的工人是一家，一点不错。大家一见如故。坐在煤上交谈着彼此的生活。他们在关心着中国的矿工，中国的工人。谈述着他们的工会历史和现在的情况。他们在恶劣的空气中吞食着面包，用瓶子里带来的凉水送到肚里去。我们要回去了，彼此伸出了黑手，紧紧的握别。
    到了上面工会办的食堂里，吃过饭，又踏上了归途。一位机器工人送到汽车站。工会的负责人再三说旅馆的一切费用由他们负责，以示招待。他们的客人汽车又临上那岗岗起伏的小镇，在那烟气笼罩的公路上驰去。两旁的小楼一排排的静置着，孩子们在街上玩着，打闹着，天井里晒的衣衫被那山风吹得在小松树的枝旁飘着，主妇们提篮子领了一些山芋和面包，回到家中。这大概是矿工们的住家了。我知道孩子们的爸爸就在他们玩耍的地底下流着汗。
    工人们的力量出足了，煤还是不够，食物还是不够，一切不够。一百八十万还是一百五十万的军队还是在海外殖民地，美国的金元是不是象伦敦的大雾一样而来不要任何代价呢？（一九四七年十月三十日伦敦）
