　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 22nd: Moscow dispatch: TASS announced on the 19th opinions obtained from Soviet leaders regarding the U.S. State Department's statement to the press on the 18th. It stated: In the U.S. State Department's special statement to the press concerning Stalin's reply to Wallace, while acknowledging the importance of Stalin's statement that unresolved issues should be peacefully resolved for universal peace, it claimed that the specific issues listed in Stalin's reply should not be regarded as topics for bilateral discussion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It further claimed that the reason previous discussions on these issues, involving other countries, had not yielded positive results was allegedly due to the Soviet Union's position. The State Department's statement caused surprise here. The State Department's argument is completely different from the U.S. government's statement on May 4th; at that time, they not only did not deny the possibility of bilateral negotiations but clearly affirmed it; otherwise, the U.S. government would certainly not have considered it possible to send a statement to the Soviet government expressing the desire to resolve differences. Moreover, everyone knows that during Roosevelt's administration, for more than three years, the most difficult international problems were resolved with the full agreement and unanimity of representatives from the U.S., Soviet Union, and Britain. So one must ask: why is the decision to reach an agreement between major powers on new and less difficult issues now considered impossible? Is this not because the current U.S. government has deviated from Roosevelt's policies and is pursuing a different policy? The Soviet people believe that the current situation is the result of the provocative stance taken by the current U.S. government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 22nd: Moscow dispatch: The New Times magazine commented on Soviet-American relations and Washington's policies, stating: A series of statements have been issued by U.S. officials which Taylor, the Third Party vice-presidential candidate, described as "pouring cold water on the hopes of the world." After these statements, the New York Herald Tribune felt it necessary to express a hope: "The United States will begin to guide its diplomatic activities in a more skillful manner." Initially, American newspapers reacted optimistically and generally clearly to the Soviet-American notes; but since the State Department instructed a change, the comments in the newspapers have become more depressed, but also extremely contradictory, vague and confused. Its content can be summarized as follows: First, dissatisfaction with the publication of both parties' "confidential" statements by Moscow Radio and Soviet newspapers. However, in these published statements, which were published in the most general form, nothing that revealed any "secrets" could be found. Moreover, the State Department itself intended to publish the full text of these two statements. This proves that the above statement is groundless. Secondly, there are various far-fetched arguments: saying that the United States retreated because if it expressed any proposals, it would be interpreted as a symbol of weakness, and the U.S. government was afraid of "losing face." This argument cannot withstand any criticism. More truthful are the comments of commentators and newspapers who see signs of hesitation in the US government's hesitation. Third, it is said that discussing existing differences is likely to fail, and if it really fails, the international situation will become more tense. This argument only seems believable to those who, from the beginning, never intended to build their relationship on an equal footing. The sudden change in American diplomacy after Smith's statement and the Soviet response exposed Washington's true attitude. Judging from the recent development of events, it is difficult to predict that this change is the last one; because, as newspapers around the world have often pointed out, one of the striking characteristics of post-war American diplomacy is clumsy changes of heart and playing tricks. One of the reasons for this trickery is for the election campaign. What new changes will Washington's foreign policy take in the future - while changing, it will desperately say: the policy is absolutely firm and absolutely unchanged! - future facts will tell us. In any case, the Soviet people are firmly and confidently facing the future and unanimously approve the Soviet government's unwavering policy of peace.

　　美帝玩弄外交花样
  　掩盖不了侵略立场
    苏联领导方面发表意见揭穿
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科讯：塔斯社于十九日公布从苏联领导方面获得对美国务院十八日向新闻界发表的声明的意见。内称：在美国务院对新闻界发表的有关斯大林给华莱士复信的特别声明中，一方面承认斯大林所说为普遍和平来和平解决悬案这一声明的重要性；另一方面却声称：斯大林复信中所列举的具体问题，不能当作美苏两国间双边讨论的题目；并称：过去有其他国家参加的对这些问题的讨论之所以没有获得积极的结果，据说乃是由于苏联所持立场的结果。国务院的声明引起这里的诧异。国务院的立论与美政府五月四日所作的声明完全不同；那时他们非但不否认双边谈判的可能性，而是显然确定了这一点的，否则美国政府便当然不会认为向苏联政府致送声明，提出解决分歧问题的愿望是可能的了。而且，大家都知道，在罗斯福执政时代，有三年多时间最困难的国际问题，都曾以美苏英三国代表完全协议与一致而得到解决。那么倒要问：现在强国间要在新的而困难较少的问题上作出协议的决定，为什么倒被认为不可能呢？这难道不是因为美国现政府已经背离罗斯福的政策，而在举行着不同的政策吗？苏联人民认为已经产生的情势乃是美国现政府所采取的挑战性的立场的结果。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】莫斯科讯：新时代杂志评论苏美关系与华盛顿政策称：美国官方人士方面发表了一连串被第三党副总统候选人泰勒称之为“对全世界的希望泼冷水”的声明。在这些声明之后，纽约先锋论坛报感到有必要表现一个希望；即：“美国将以更巧妙的方式开始指导其外交活动”。起先，美报纸对美苏照会的反应是乐观的，而且一般说来是明确的；但自国务院授意改变以后，报上的评论就变成比较沮丧、同时也极为矛盾、含糊与混乱。其内容可概括如下：第一，对莫斯科电台和苏维埃报纸公布双方“机密”的声明表示不满。可是在这已公布的、而且是以最一般的形式公布的声明中，无论如何也找不到透露了什么“机密”的东西。何况国务院本身也有把这两个声明全文公布的意思。这就证明上述说法是毫无根据的。其次，有各种牵强附会的论点：说美国之所以退却，是因为它如果表示任何提议都会被解释成为软弱的象征，并且美国政府害怕“丢面子”。这种论点，是受不住任何批评的。比较真实的，倒是那些就在美政府的犹豫不决中看出疑虑不定的征象的评论员和报刊的言论。第三，说什么讨论现存的分歧，很可能遭到失败，而假设真的失败，则国际局势将更为紧张。这种论点只有在那些从开始起就无意把对方的关系建立在平等的基础上者看来，才似乎是可以相信的。美国外交上在史密斯声明与苏方答复之后所作的突然转变，暴露了华盛顿的真正态度。从最近事变的发展看来，很难预料这一次的转变乃是最后一次的了；因为有如全世界报纸所经常指出的，战后美国外交的显著特点之一，便是很笨拙的朝令暮改和玩花样。这种玩花样的原因之一，是为了竞选。华盛顿的外交政策此后将采取什么新的转变——一面转，一面还会拚命说：政策绝对坚定和绝对不变呀！——将来的事实自会告诉我们。无论怎样，苏联人民是坚定而有信心的面向将来，并且一致赞成苏联政府坚守不渝的和平政策。
