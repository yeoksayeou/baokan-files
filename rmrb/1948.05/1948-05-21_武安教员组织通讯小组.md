　　Wu'an Teachers Organize Correspondence Groups
    [Wu'an News] At this conference of primary and secondary school teachers in Wu'an, a correspondence campaign was launched. A total of fifty-six correspondence groups were organized throughout the county, with a total of five hundred and one primary and secondary school teachers participating. Each person subscribed to a plan to write two to three articles per month. The Yangyi base area correspondence group proposed that writing should focus on the actual events in the village, and that the articles should be read aloud to the masses after they are written. They also suggested that there should be no discouragement if the articles are not published in the newspaper. The Eighth District established "mutual aid groups" to revise each other's drafts. Everyone recognizes that writing is not only promoting work, but it is also of great benefit to oneself. (Wen Shan, Wu'an Education Section)

　　武安教员组织通讯小组
    【武安消息】武安在这次高初小教员会议上，发起了组织通讯运动，全县共组织了五十六个通讯小组，参加通讯小组的高初小教职员共五百零一人，每人都订了争取每月写两篇到三篇稿子的计划。阳邑基点通讯小组提出写稿要写村上的实际事情，写完以后再给群众念一遍。并提出，报上不登也不灰心。八区成立了“互助小组”，写好稿子互相修改。写稿大家都认识了不但是推动工作，对自己也有很大好处。（武安教育科文珊）
