All factories and shops in our city have prepared a large number of goods, such as sickles, plows, harrows, hoes, cotton bows, brooms, ladles, sieves, wooden forks and other agricultural tools; pots, pot lids, steamers, bamboo tubes, bellows, bamboo baskets and other daily utensils; socks, towels, various colored printed cloths, soaps, paper, seasonal new shoes and other daily necessities; various pickles and preserved bean curd, stinky tofu, various kinds of dim sum, fresh candies, etc., all of which are of extremely high quality and low price.

We sincerely expect factories, shops, and peddlers from all regions to come and sell various goods, especially various agricultural tools, and to exchange and trade cotton, salt, grain, livestock, medicinal materials, homespun cloth, etc. Our association will do its best to entertain and help promote sales, and all expenses will be waived. Merchants from all liberated areas are welcome to come for free trade and sightseeing. The government will provide guarantees in all aspects. For the sake of economy, the sale of superstitious items is prohibited at the fair. At that time, new opera troupes, old opera troupes, drum storytelling, circuses, dragon lanterns, stilt walkers, grand tutors, and other performances will be held to add to the fun, making it extremely lively. A night market will also be opened, with bright lights, as bright as day. Peasants and industrialists and business people from all regions who have turned over a new leaf, do not miss this opportunity, come at that time, and this association will provide appropriate care!
