Comrades Editors:
    Pengcheng in Ci County is a place in our border region that produces porcelain clay. Before liberation, these pottery kilns were all operated by local capitalists (kiln owners). During the war against Japan, their exploitation of the workers was also very cruel. After liberation, some of the big kiln owners, fearing struggle sessions, fled. These kilns then became public property and are still being run by the public. During the mass movement last year, another portion of pottery kilns was confiscated. Some of these kilns became the property of the village masses, and some were transferred to the workers themselves (i.e., changing the deity but not the temple). Some kiln owners even had their family property and houses confiscated. Given the policy of protecting industry and commerce, how should such situations be handled? Should the pottery kilns of these escaped kiln owners be returned to them? If so, to whom should they be returned? How should they be returned? Should the pottery kilns confiscated during last year's movement be returned? Should the confiscated houses and property also be returned? If they are returned, will the masses and workers be ideologically amenable to this? If not, how should it be resolved? What if the raw materials and tools on the kilns are missing during the return?

Comrade Yi Xi:
    Private magnetic industry operated in Pengcheng should be resolutely protected and supported in its development, according to the Central Bureau's instructions on industry and commerce. The situation reflected in your letter, where owners have fled or property was confiscated during the mass movement, should be quickly corrected according to the Central Bureau's instructions: for fleeing owners, the government should try to persuade them to return to the liberated areas to operate their businesses through various channels. Before they return, if they have agents, the pottery kilns can be kept by the agents. If there are no agents, they should be kept by the government. Once the original owners return, the kilns should be returned to them to operate. The property confiscated during last year's mass movement, regardless of whether it was given to the village masses or to the workers, should be immediately returned to the original owners for continued operation. The confiscated family property and houses of the kiln owners should also be returned unconditionally. If the individual is both an industrial capitalist and a landlord, and if this portion of the property is not connected to his pottery kiln but is connected to his landlord land, then it should not be returned. If raw materials and tools are missing, the method of compensation or retroactive compensation can be determined based on the circumstances, or the government can provide loan support. It is essential to ensure that the original owners can continue to operate their businesses. If the masses and workers disagree, they should be guided and enlightened from the perspective of the long-term interests of the masses, and it is essential to resolutely persuade the masses to firmly implement the policy on industry and commerce.

　　彭城没收磁窑财产应无条件退还原主编辑同志：
    磁县彭城是我边区的产磁地方，未解放前，这些磁窑都是当地的资本家（窑主）所经营，抗战中他们对工人的剥削也很残酷，解放后，一部分大窑主怕挨斗逃跑了，这些碗窑归了公，现在还是公家经营着。去年大运动时，又有一部分磁窑被没收了，这些磁窑有的成了本村群众的，有的归工人自转（即换神不换庙）。有的连这些窑主的家产房屋也被没收了。象这样的情况，在保护工商业政策下，应该怎样处理？这些跑了的窑主的磁窑是否还要退还给他？如退还，退还给谁？怎样退还？去年运动时没收了的磁窑是否退还？没收了的房屋财产是否也要退还？如退还的话，群众和工人的思想是否闹通了呢？闹不通怎样解决？退还时如窑上的原料工具少了怎办？　　　　　　读者　一溪一溪同志：
    彭城私人经营的磁业，应根据中央局关于工商业的指示，坚决保护，并扶持其发展。如来信中所反映的业主逃亡或在大运动时被没收的情况，应根据中央局指示，迅速纠正：对逃亡业主，应由政府通过各种关系，争取他们重返解放区营业，在其未回来前，他们若有代理人，磁窑可由代理人保管，无代理人的由政府保管，待原业主归来后，仍交其本人经营。去年大运动中没收的不管归本村群众或归工人，都应立即退还原业主继续经营。没收窑主的家产房屋也应一律退还。其本人若是工业资本家兼地主，如这部分财产不与其磁窑相连，而与其地主土地相连的，则不应退还。原料工具少了的，可看情况决定补偿或追补办法，或由政府贷款支持，一定要做到使原业主能继续营业，假若群众和工人闹不通，应从群众长远利益上诱导启发，一定要坚决说服群众坚定执行工商业政策。
