    Wu Xiang Fifth District Convenes Production Committee
    Corrects Wrongful Struggles House by House
    [Wu Xiang News] In order to inspect and resolve obstacles in production and to launch a concentrated planting campaign, the Fifth District convened a meeting of village production committee members on April 27th. With the exception of four villages that evenly distributed land, a total of eighteen administrative villages participated. The meeting inspected and initially resolved the difficulties faced by poor and middle peasants. It focused on organizing loans for 32 villages, providing a total of 500,500 yuan (old currency) to 299 poor peasant households and 1,661,500 yuan (old currency) to 150 middle peasant households. Combined with funds raised by the masses, they purchased a total of 37 cattle, 1 mule, 1 donkey, and 837 pieces of agricultural equipment. Secondly, relatively sound leadership organizations were established. Village production committees have been formed, selecting good village cadres and able-bodied poor and middle peasants. For example, Zhao Wu-kui, the newly elected committee member in Chengguan, said to village chief Liang Wen-jin, "From now on, let's work together to do a good job." Because they discuss and practically solve problems together, the village's production is more vigorous. The inspection revealed that the serious "fear of getting rich" mentality is still widespread. For example, Wei Mo-suo of Fu Zhuang is unwilling to move. When someone encouraged him to join a mutual aid group, he said, "If I get rich, I won't be able to maintain the poor peasant stance." Wu Bo-yuan, an old middle peasant from Wang Jia Gou, used to work very hard, but he stopped working last fall. When asked why he wasn't working, he said, "The more you do, the more problems you have. It's not good to become a rich peasant. Wu Jin-sheng in our village doesn't work much, but he is always a poor peasant, and this year he borrowed grain and gained power. It's enough for me to have enough to eat and wear." The main reason is the wrongful struggle against middle peasants, which was not immediately corrected. Simply publicizing the Land Law Outline and the Border Region Government Proclamation cannot solve the masses' ideological problems.
    From the district leadership's inspection, it was proposed during the spring production arrangements to support poor peasant production, correct wrongful struggles against middle peasants, and resettle landlords and rich peasants who could not make a living. However, in specific implementation, there was no in-depth inspection and assistance, and no specific demonstrations were made to correct the wrongful struggles against middle peasants, so the policy was not implemented.
    At this meeting, the issue of middle peasants was specifically studied, and village production committee members were asked to inspect each household to clarify the number of households that had been wrongly struggled against. A decision was made to immediately correct the situation. After a day of research, each village reached a conclusion. For example, Wang Jia Gou determined to correct 13 households, Zhang Jia Gou determined to correct 21 households, and a total of 134 middle peasant households were to be corrected in the 18 villages of the district. Apologies were made to these households. Those that should be unsealed were immediately unsealed, those that should have things returned had them returned, and those that should be compensated were compensated as much as possible. Those households that could not be clearly identified or could not make a living were to be resettled immediately, totaling 47 households in the district. The district immediately approved the use of items for these households, to be paid for from the villages' own fruits or confiscated property, or borrowed. This first solved the problem of the production committee members themselves being afraid to get rich. For example, the village chief of Nie Village said, "Correcting the wrongly struggled middle peasant households will increase the enthusiasm for production, and mutual aid groups will be able to do better." Finally, each village drew up a plan for a concentrated planting campaign, proposing to complete all planting five days before the busy season.

    武乡五区召开生产委员会
    挨村挨户纠正错斗
    【武乡消息】五区为了检查解决生产中障碍，开展突击下种运动，特于四月二十七号召开各村生产委员会议，除四个平分村未参加外，共十八个行政村，检查各村初步解决了贫雇中农的困难，有重点的组织了卅二个村的贷款，共贷给贫农二百九十九户，洋五十万零五百元，贷给中农一百五十户，共洋一百六十六万一千五百元，结合群众资金共买牛三十七头，骡一头、驴一头，农具八百三十七件。其次是建立了比较健全的领导组织，各村生产委员会已成立，里边选的有好的村干部，又有能劳动的贫中农，如城关新选的委员赵五魁对村长梁文斤说：“今后咱们好好联系起来把工作搞好。”由于他们互相商讨实际解决问题，该村生产比较有劲。检查中发现到现在还普遍的存在着严重的不敢发家思想。如傅庄魏磨锁不动弹，有人动员他参加互助组，他说：“发了家就站不住贫雇立场了。”王家沟旧中农武波元过去劳动很好，去秋以来不动了，问他你为什么不劳动了？他说：“再闹的东西多，成了个富农就不好了。咱村武金生不大劳动，人家经常是贫雇，今年又借上粮又掌了权。咱闹的够吃够穿就算了。”主要原因是错斗了中农，没有即时纠正，单纯宣传土地法大纲和边府布告，解决不了群众思想问题。
    从区的领导上检查，今春布置生产时也曾提出扶植贫雇生产、纠正错斗中农、安置无法生活的地主富农。但在具体执行中，没有深入检查与帮助，对纠正错斗的中农，没具体做出示范，因此政策没有贯彻下去。
    在这次会议上，对中农问题专门作了研究，让各村生产委员逐户检查，弄清错斗户数，作了决定回去马上纠正。经过一天研究，各村都得出了结论，如王家沟确定纠正十三户，张家沟确定纠正廿一户，全区共十八个村，决定纠正错斗中农一百三十四户，并向这些户道歉。马上该启封的启封，该退东西的退东西，该想法补偿的补偿。下余一时弄不清的和无法生活的户，回去马上安置，全区共计马上安置四十七户。这些户用的东西，区上当面即给批准，从他们自己村果实内或整财内开支或借用，这样首先就解决了各生产委员本身不敢发家的思想。如聂村村长说：“纠正了错斗中农户，生产劲头会更大，互助组就越能搞好了。”最后各村订了突击下种计划，提出要争取在忙种前五天全部下种。
