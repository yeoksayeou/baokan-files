[Ji Lu Yu News] Fugitive merchants in Liaocheng are returning one after another, and industry and commerce are gradually recovering and prospering. During last year's re-examination, due to "leftist" errors in leadership, 103 industrial and commercial enterprises in Liaocheng were struggled against. As a result, merchants were panicked and afraid to do business. Heng De Tang Pharmacy has a history of more than 300 years. Last year, due to fear, it was only going through the motions, not buying goods, but selling a little to live off of. When people from the countryside came to buy goods from him, if they wanted five jin, he would persuade them to buy three jin. Old Man Wang, who sold porridge in Beimenli, used to be able to sell a whole vat of porridge in one morning, and his whole family had enough to eat and drink. Since last autumn, he has not been able to sell it. He said, "With big business, small business can also make money; without big business, small business is also no good." Since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, merchants have learned that industry and commerce must be protected, and seeing reports of compensation and return to industry and commerce, they began to feel relieved. Some pooled shares to do business, and some went to Jinan to purchase goods. Now the city has increased by more than 100 private businesses. The capital of Dadong Freight Station has reached 6 million yuan, and the capital of Dongxing Freight Station and Juyuan Oil Station are both in the millions of yuan. In addition, a freight station on Guangming Street and a cart shop on Zhabei Street are being prepared and will soon be open for business. Previously, there was only one uniform shop, now the number has increased to eight. The public-owned Taixinglong and Yunchang Freight Stations now have frequent traffic from Jinan merchants, no less than 20 or 30 people every day. They transport goods in and buy goods out, with freedom of business. Because commerce has begun to recover and prosper, the lives of the urban poor are also better than before. They have organized a porter's union, and each person can earn 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per day. Yunchang Freight Station alone can provide for the lives of more than 1,400 poor people every day. On the 17th of this month, after the Dongchunchi Bathhouse on Dongguan Street was returned to its original owner, the news quickly spread throughout the city, and merchants became more confident in the policy of protecting industry and commerce. Industrial and commercial operators who were struggled against and fled are returning one after another. Old Hu Dachen's wife came back to assess the situation and prepared to call her husband back from Jinan. Liu Xuting's eldest son has already asked someone to call his father to Jinan. Ding Qindang ran to the countryside after being struggled against, and is now back as a shop assistant in the Democratic Grain Store. Yang Rongshan and his son have also returned, his son became a shop assistant, and he himself opened a mill again. Now 13 industrial and commercial households who were struggled against have returned and began to do business with peace of mind.

　　逃亡商人纷纷回来
  　聊城增加私商百余家
  　贫民搬运货物生活得到改善
    【冀鲁豫消息】聊城逃亡商人纷纷归来，工商业逐渐恢复繁荣。去年复查时，由于领导上的左倾错误，聊城斗争了一百零三家工商业。因此商人恐慌，不敢营业。恒德堂药行有三百多年的历史，去年因为害怕，也只是应付门面，不买货，卖一点吃一点。乡里有人来买他的货时，人家要五斤，他劝人家买三斤。北门里卖粥的汪老头，过去一早晨能卖完一缸粥，全家人有吃有喝。从去年秋里就卖不动了。他说：“有大买卖，小买卖也能混钱；没大买卖，小买卖也不行了。”从土地法大纲颁布后，商人们知道了要保护工商业，又见到报上登着补偿退还工商业，开始放心了。有的集股作买卖，有的到济南去办货。现在全市已增加了一百家以上的私营买卖。大东货栈资本已达六百万元，东兴货栈和聚源油栈资本均在几百万元。另外，光明街的一家货栈和闸北街的一家车行正在筹备，不久即可营业。从前只有一家制服店，现在增至八家。公营的太兴隆和运昌货栈，现在经常有济南商人来往，每天不下二三十人。他们运货来，买货去，营业自由。因为商业开始恢复繁荣了，城市贫民的生活也比从前好了。他们组织有搬运工会，每天每人可弄到一两千元。仅运昌货栈一家，每天就能顾住一千四百多贫民生活。本月十七日，东关大街的东春池澡塘归还原主后，消息很快传遍全市，商人们对保护工商业的政策更加相信，被斗逃亡的工商业者纷纷归来。胡大臣的老婆回来摸了底，准备到济南把丈夫叫回来。刘绪亭的大儿已经找人到济南去叫他父亲，丁钦当被斗后跑到乡里，现在也回来在民主粮店当了店员。杨荣山爷儿俩也都回来，他儿当了店员，他自己又开起磨坊来了。现在已有十三户被斗的工商业主回来，开始安心营业。
