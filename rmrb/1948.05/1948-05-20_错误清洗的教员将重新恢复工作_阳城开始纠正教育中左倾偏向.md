【Taiyue News】 Yangcheng has begun to correct the "Leftist" deviations in its educational work. Since last autumn, there have been chaotic phenomena in various villages and schools, such as squeezing out teachers and students from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, arbitrarily deducting teachers' salaries and rice, and confiscating students' books and stationery. Some villages blindly replaced teachers with poor and hired peasant teachers. In Daling Village, a stonemason was appointed as a teacher. In Zhanggou, a coal miner named Lu Maimai was appointed as a teacher. He could earn two shi of rice per month working in the kiln, but as a teacher, he only earned six dou of rice per month, making it difficult to make a living and affecting his motivation. Su Wenzhi, a poor peasant teacher in Yigu, cried because he was illiterate and unable to read the newspaper, which greatly harmed his work. At the "May Fourth" conference of cultural and educational workers, everyone thoroughly examined these phenomena and the reasons behind them ideologically, and formulated corrective measures: (1) The county government recently convened a meeting of teachers who had been wrongfully dismissed to explain the policies, dispel their concerns, and assign them work according to their individual circumstances. (2) The salaries and rice of teachers and school funds for all public and private primary and secondary schools in the county shall not be arbitrarily reduced below the standards set by the government. (3) The salaries and rice deducted from teachers on the job last winter and the illegal apportionment of labor rice from teachers and students should be returned in full. (4) Regardless of their class background, all teachers in various villages who were wrongfully dismissed in the past should be paid in full for the salaries and rice they accumulated during their tenure. (5) Hereafter, the power to appoint and dismiss teachers shall rest solely with the county government, and no organization, group, or individual shall be allowed to appoint or dismiss teachers at will.

　　错误清洗的教员将重新恢复工作
    阳城开始纠正教育中左倾偏向
    【太岳消息】阳城开始纠正教育工作中的左倾偏向。去年秋季以来，各村各学校曾发生了排挤地主富农出身的教员学生，随便克扣教员薪米，没收学生书籍文具等等混乱现象。有些村盲目的换上贫雇教员。大岭村叫一个石匠当教员，张沟叫煤窑工人卢麦麦当教员，他在窑上做工每月能落两石米，当了教员一月赚六斗米，生活困难干的没劲。宜固贫雇教员苏文直因识字少不会念报急的哭了，损害工作很大。在“五四”文教工作者会议上，大家把这些现象以及造成这些现象的原因从思想上作了清算，并定出纠正的办法：（一）县府最近召集过去被清洗的教员开会，说明政策解除顾虑，分别情况分配工作。（二）凡本县各公立民办高初小学的教员薪米与学校经费，按政府规定标准不准随便减低。（三）去冬扣除在职教员的薪米与非法摊派教员学生的差米应一律退还。（四）过去各村被清洗的教员不论成份如何，在职期间所积欠的薪米应一律如数付给。（五）今后教员的任免权一律归县政府，任何机关团体或个人不准随便任免教员。
