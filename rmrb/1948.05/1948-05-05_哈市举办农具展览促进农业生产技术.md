Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. In order to improve agricultural production technology and enable urban industry to serve agriculture, the Northeast Political Committee, Songjiang Provincial Government, Harbin Municipal Government, and Harbin Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly organized the first Harbin Agricultural Implement Exhibition on the 19th of this month. Representatives of farmers from various provinces in North Manchuria were sent to visit. The exhibits include the improved and created seeders, corn threshers, small threshing machines, large seeders, and other industrial departments' trial-produced weeding machines, hay balers, land reclamation machines, and various hoes, sickles, mattocks, harrows, and sideline production such as rope spinning machines, bag weaving machines, totaling 580 types. All can save manpower and animal power, and production efficiency is very high. For example, the seeder can complete the seeding work at one time, saving two people. The weeding machine can complete shoveling and harrowing at one time, and two people and two horses can complete six hectares of land in one day. The corn thresher is equipped with a windmill and sieve, which can automatically separate corn stalks and stubble. Two people can sift one ton a day, and if electricity is used, it can sift more than two tons. Farmers from various places also provided specific improvement suggestions at the meeting, such as Xiangfang farmers suggesting that installing a round knife on the land reclamation machine can save one horsepower, and changing the small iron wheel in front of the plow to a plow-bottom shape will not be afraid of uneven ground and wet grass and mud blockage. Using a curved iron rod behind the plowshare of the turning plow is better than using an iron plate, which can reduce resistance and make the soil loose, which are all extremely valuable opinions. The Harbin Daily editorial pointed out that the exhibition is a harbinger of closer urban-rural relations, improving agricultural technology, and promoting research, invention, and creation of agricultural implements. During the period of Japanese occupation of the Northeast, in order to make the Northeast its aggressive warehouse, it carried out the improvement of agricultural implements and transferred 35 machinery and furniture factories from Hokkaido to various parts of the Northeast. However, because its purpose was to intensify the exploitation of farmers, and the new agricultural implements were not suitable for the rural conditions in the Northeast, it was opposed by the farmers and ultimately failed.

　　哈市举办农具展览促进农业生产技术
    【新华社东北二日电】东北政委会、松江省政府、哈尔滨市政府及哈市工商联合会为改进农业生产技术，使城市工业为农业服务，特于本月十九日联合举办哈市第一届农具展览会。北满各省均派农民代表前往参观，展览品中计有东北农林处农具研究室改良与创造的播种机，苞米脱粒机，小型打谷机，大型播种机，及其他工业部门试制成功之锄草机，捆草机，开荒机，以及各种锄、镰、镢、耙与副业生产之纺绳机，织袋机等共五百八十种。皆能节省人力畜力，生产效率甚高。如播种机能一次完成播种工作，省两个人力，锄草机一次完成铲和趟，两人两马一天能完成六垧地。苞米脱粒机附有风车和筛子，能自动把苞米草屑和秆子分开，两个人力一天能筛出一吨，若用电力能筛出二吨以上。会上各地农民并提供了具体改进的意见，如香坊农民提议在开荒机上按一圆刀就可省一马力，把犁前小铁轮改成为犁底形就不怕地面不平和湿草泥的堵塞，翻土犁的铧子后面用弯铁棍比用铁板好，能减轻阻力，使土块松碎等，皆为极宝贵的意见。哈尔滨日报社论指出展览会为使城乡关系更加密切，而成为改进农业技术的先声，促进了对农具的研究发明与创造。按日寇侵占东北期内，为使东北成为他的侵略仓库，曾进行改良农具并自北海道迁移三十五家机械家具工厂至东北各地，但因其目的在加紧榨取农民，且各新农具不适用于东北农村情况，故遭农民反对，终归失败。
