    Is Hiring a Long-Term Laborer by a Family Member Serving as a Puppet Soldier Considered Exploitation?
    To the Editor:
    I. We are currently in the process of classifying class status here. There are quite a few people who served as puppet soldiers during the period when the enemy occupied the area (1942-1944). If, at that time, the person himself left, and the family hired a long-term laborer or half a laborer, does this count as exploitation? Also, is there a difference between going voluntarily and being forced to go?
    II. The newspaper reported the cancellation of travel permits. Should children and women still stand guard? Children mainly check travel permits, and women entertain passing troops. Now that the war has shifted to the outer lines and there are fewer passing troops, is it still appropriate to provide hospitality?
          (Wang Jianhua, Third District, Zuoquan)

To Comrade Jianhua:
    Except for the families of revolutionary staff and revolutionary soldiers who rent out or hire labor to cultivate land due to the lack of or insufficient labor force, all other individuals who rent out or hire labor to cultivate land are considered to be engaged in exploitation. Hiring a long-term laborer while serving as a puppet soldier is considered exploitation. However, when classifying class status, a distinction should be made between going voluntarily and being forced to go. Those who went voluntarily are considered to have labor power but not participating in labor; those who were forced to go are considered to have lost their labor power due to unavoidable reasons. But it should be noted that regardless of whether it was forced or voluntary, if their land and property holdings do not exceed those of an average middle peasant, they should not be considered landlords or rich peasants, but should be considered other class components based on their specific circumstances.
    Children and women standing guard is unnecessary in core areas and under normal circumstances. Providing passing troops with drinking water when they are thirsty, and providing care for the wounded and sick, should still be done whenever necessary.

    家里有人当伪军用长工算不算剥削？
    编辑同志：
    一、这里正在划阶级中，遇到过去（三十一年三十三年）敌人占过地方当过伪军的人很不少。可是在那时他本人走了，家庭觅长工一个或半个，这算不算剥削？另外，自愿去、被迫去有什么分别？
    二、报上登出取消路条，儿童妇女站岗是否还站？儿童主要是查路条，妇女是招待过路军，现战争转到外线，过路军人少，是否还可以招待？
          （左权三区王建华）建华同志：
    除革命职员革命军人家庭因没有或缺少劳动力而出租或雇工耕种土地者外，其余任何人出租或雇工耕种土地都算剥削。当伪军而觅长工的，算是剥削。不过，在划成份时，自愿去与被迫去是应该分别的，自愿去的，算是有劳力而不参加劳动；被迫去的，算是因不可抗的原因而丧失劳动力。但要注意，不管是被迫的或自愿的；其土地财产占有状况不超过一般中农的，都不应认为地主或富农，而应按其具体情况认为其他成份。
    儿童妇女站岗，在腹心区，在平常情况下，是不必要的。过路军人口渴了喝些开水之类和对于伤病员，无论何时，只要有招待的必要，还是应该招待的。
