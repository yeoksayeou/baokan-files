　　Changing Labor and Mutual Aid Together
  　Du Village Seizes the Time to Plant
    [Wu'an News] The democratic land redistribution work in Du Village, Wu'an County, has been successfully completed, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the entire village. With the early vegetables (substituting for a season's crops) ripe and a light rain falling on the 17th, men, women, and children were extremely excited. They spontaneously implemented mutual aid and labor exchange, participating in the harvest and rushing to plant, forming a production movement.

    In recent days, ten middle and poor peasant households have bought and exchanged livestock. Shen Deli, a middle peasant who was wrongly classified, received compensation for one-fifth of his livestock (i.e., five households sharing one animal) during the land redistribution. The same was true for a large cart. Because it was difficult for multiple households to feed it well, it was sold, and each household received 30,000 yuan. He added 56,000 yuan and bought an ox. Yang Chunhui and Jia Xijiu, households who were wrongly classified, sold the compensated one-fifth share of livestock and cart and each added money to buy an ox. Yang Baocheng and Yang Baogui, with the consent of the five households, combined their compensated livestock and cart, valued at 150,000 yuan, and gave it to themselves. Poor peasant Jia Chou bought an ox for 70,000 yuan. Han ＠ming originally had an ox and has now exchanged it for a mule. Shen Deli said, "We have moved back to our original house, and we have everything. It's even better than before we suffered. If you don't believe me, just wait two years and see." All are actively buying and exchanging livestock to develop production and become prosperous. A total of six animals were newly purchased.

    Due to the joint efforts of men, women, and children, and mutual aid and labor exchange, the entire village's more than 600 mu of early vegetables were harvested in three days. During the harvest, most families worked in the fields together. Generally, labor exchange involved three to five or six households, with more than ten people. Shen Deli and three other households, with eight people in total, harvested thirteen mu in one day. Children (ten years old) also participated in the harvest. Yang Qingyuan's entire family harvested six mu before eating breakfast in the mid-morning. Han ＠ming used a cart to transport early vegetables home and also hauled manure (on return trips). Men and women also exchanged labor equally. When Yang Qiutian harvested, there were nine people, including six women.

    The spontaneous labor exchange during the early vegetable harvest led to the formation of mutual aid groups for planting. For example, Yang Fushan (a party member) freely combined twelve people into a group during the breakfast gathering on the 17th. The next day, the entire group went all out to rush planting. Yang Shuangshan (the group leader) and two households planted and rolled eight mu in one day. Yang Fushan, Jia Xiaoting, and three other households plowed and planted. One donkey was used to plant fifteen mu. Animals were used for planting in the front, and people pulled rollers behind. Zhang Taiyi planted three mu in the afternoon. His wife led the animals and did odd jobs in the field. The masses in the entire village are still actively rushing to plant. (Ru Xiu)

　　变工互助一齐动手
  　杜庄趁垧突击下种
    【武安消息】武安杜庄村民主填补工作胜利完毕，全村生产情绪大大提高。又值小菜（顶一季庄稼）已熟，十七号又落浅雨，男女老少异常兴奋，自动的实行互助变工，参加收割，突击下种，已形成生产运动。
    最近几天当中，有十户中、贫农买换牲口。错斗的中农申得立在填补当中得到补偿牲口五分之一（即五户伙一个），一辆大车也如此，因户多不易喂好，出卖后，各分三万元，他又添了五万六千元，买了一头牛。错斗户杨春会、贾西九，将原补偿的五分之一的牲口大车出卖后，又添上钱各自买了一个牛。杨保成、杨保贵，将补偿的牲口大车，经五户同意，共折十五万元，合给了自己。贫农贾丑七万元买一牛。韩＠明原有一牛，现已调换成骡子。申得立说：“咱也搬回咱原来房子住了，什么也有了，比过去受的还要红。你不信，再过二年看”。都是积极买换牲口来生产发家。共添买六个。
    由于男女老少一齐下手，互助变工，三天就将全村六百多亩小菜收割完了。收割当中，多半都是全家下地，一般变工是三户到五六户，十多个人。申得立等四户八个人互助，一天收割了十三亩。小孩（十岁）也参加收割。杨庆元全家到半前晌未吃早饭，收割六亩。韩＠明往家用车拉小菜，同时拉粪（来回脚）。男女也同样变工。杨秋田收割时共有九人，其中妇女就有六个。
    在割小菜当中自发变工的，到下种时就组成互助小组。如杨富山（党员）在十七日吃早饭的饭场中，就自由结合十二人成为一组。第二天全组全力突击下种。杨双山（组长）两户一天连种带砘下种八亩。杨富山、贾小廷等三户，犁的犁，种的种，一个驴种了十五亩。前头用牲口种，后边人拉砘。张太一下午种了三亩。老婆到地牵牲口，并打杂活。全村群众现仍在积极突击下种。（儒修）
