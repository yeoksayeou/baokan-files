　　"Leftist" Errors Hinder Production
  　Gaoyi Formulates Solutions

　　[Gaoyi News] Gaoyi convened a county-wide production cadre meeting on April 23rd to review the sowing work of the past ten days. Statistics from fifty-three villages show that over 40,000 mu of cotton, sorghum, beans, corn, and yams have been sown. Some villages integrated mutual aid teams with sowing and quickly completed plans according to groups; however, these were only a few villages. On a county-wide scale, this phase of production work is still flowing freely. The reason is that district cadres generally have the idea of not daring to be bold and fearing to make mistakes. For example, eight middle peasant households in Shiliang Village were sealed off last year. The last meeting decided to immediately unseal them and publicly admit the error, but three households have not yet been unsealed. Comrades working in the village said that they had not gone through rectification and did not know what class these three households should be classified as. Now that they have been unsealed, won't they be following the rich peasant line if they are classified as rich peasants in the future? Secondly, the comrades participating in production are also unable to affirm their thoughts on some specific issues. For example, they are unclear on issues such as the old base issue, wrongly struggling against middle peasants, landlords and rich peasants, and poor peasant groups established without a work team, and they do not dare to solve them boldly, so production is difficult to lead.

　　This sowing review meeting lasted for four days, and finally affirmed the following points: (1) Regarding the old base issue, analyze and understand its history, advantages, disadvantages, and relationship with the masses. We cannot one-sidedly think that they are all bad, and we should generally adopt the policy of education and transformation. For particularly bad cadres, they can be dismissed and replaced when necessary; if the masses particularly hate them, we can adopt the method of admitting errors in a large meeting and then dismissing them. However, we must pay attention to not turning it into a general replacement of cadres. (2) The wrongly struggled against middle peasants (including well-to-do middle peasants) must be resolutely compensated, or a meeting should be held to allow cadres who occupied more fruits or the masses who divided more fruits to lend a portion to the wrongly struggled against middle peasants. The sealed doors of middle peasants must be unsealed immediately, and the interests of middle peasants must absolutely not be violated. (3) Regarding the issue of landlords and rich peasants, landlords and rich peasants should be allowed to live, and they should be given certain means of production. Under the principle of democracy and voluntariness, landlords and rich peasants can participate in mutual aid teams. Stop landlords and rich peasants from providing unpaid labor to the masses and abolish the landlord and rich peasant signs; however, the method of cancellation should be cautious. It should be done through the masses, so that the masses understand the benefits of cancellation to the masses, and let landlords and rich peasants understand that this is to allow them to produce well and transform themselves. (4) The issue of the cancellation of poor peasant associations. Most of the poor peasant associations or poor peasant groups that were not established by a work team are manipulated by bad cadres; however, some represent the masses. The good ones can participate in leading production, and the bad ones should have their mistakes exposed in front of the masses, and be cancelled through the masses. (Zeng Liang, Wen Yan)

　　左倾错误障碍生产
  　高邑订出解决办法
    【高邑消息】高邑于四月二十三日召开全县生产干部会议，检查十天的下种工作。五十三个村统计，下种棉花、高粱、豆子、玉茭、山药等共达四万多亩。有些村庄结合下种整顿了互助，并按组订计划，完成得很快；但只是少数村。就全县说来，这一段生产工作仍是自流的。原因是区干部普遍存在着不敢大胆干，怕犯错误的想法。比如，石良庄去年封了八户中农门子，上次会议决定要立即启封，公开承认错误，但现在还有三户未启。该村工作同志谈，自己没经过整编，闹不清到底这三户该算啥成份。现在给他们启了封，以后划阶级如划成富农，自己不走了富农路线吗？其次是参加生产的同志，对有些具体问题，思想也肯定不起来。如对老基础问题、错斗中农问题、地富问题，以及未经过工作队成立的贫雇小组等问题，思想上都弄不清，不敢大胆解决，生产也就很难领导。
    这次检查下种会议上，一直研究了四天，最后肯定了以下几点：（一）对老基础问题，分析认识其历史与优点缺点、与群众的关系。不能片面认为都坏了，一般应采取教育与改造方针。对特别坏的干部，必要时可撤职调换；如系群众特别仇恨的，可采用大会承认错误，然后撤职的办法。但必须注意不要闹成普遍的换干部。（二）对斗错的中农（包括富裕中农）要坚决补偿，或召开大会，让多占果实的干部或多分果实的群众，借出一部给错斗中农。封中农门的要立即启封，对中农利益绝对不能侵犯。（三）地主富农问题，要让地主富农生活下去，给其一定的生产资料。在民主自愿原则下，地富分子可参加互助组。停止地富给群众无代价的劳动，取消地富记号；但取消方法要慎重，通过群众，使群众了解取消对群众的好处，让地富懂得这是让好好生产，改造自己。（四）贫农团的取消问题。没经工作团成立的贫农团或贫农小组，大部是操纵在坏干部手中的；但也有些是代表群众的。好的可参加领导生产，坏的要在群众面前揭露他们的错误，通过群众来取消。（增亮、文彦）
