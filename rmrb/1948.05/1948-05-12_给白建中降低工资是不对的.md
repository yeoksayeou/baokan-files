    It is Wrong to Reduce Bai Jianzhong's Salary
    Comrade Editor:
    My brother and I had 44 mu of land when our father was alive, and a family of five. My father passed away in the 13th year of the Republic of China. My stepmother was addicted to taking golden pills, relying on selling family property to survive each year. By the 18th year, only 21 mu of land remained, which was also mortgaged to others. Our life was basically without rice to cook. My stepmother remarried, and I lived with my sister's family. My brother worked as a long-term laborer for others, and my sister-in-law cooked for others. My sister's family was also too poor to support me, so I herded sheep for others for three years starting at the age of fourteen, and worked as a long-term laborer at seventeen. In addition to working as a long-term laborer, my brother also learned carpentry for two years. At the age of twenty-two, I guarded a temple in the village for two years, and incidentally cooked for the teacher. My brother did carpentry work when he had time. In this way, we gradually redeemed the mortgaged land and also had a donkey. In 1943, due to the disaster and famine, I started working, and in 1946, I also got married. My life was much better than before. Last year, during the mass movement in February, my brother acted as an air-raid shelter for the landlord Bai Jubao, which also led to our family being struggled against and four mu of land being taken away. The donkey was also sold to repay the borrowed grain, and my sister-in-law also passed away due to illness. As it stands now, there are five people in the family, living in three cave dwellings, cultivating twenty mu of land. The only labor force is my brother, with two children (the older one thirteen, the younger one eight) and my unhealthy wife helping. According to the average land per person in our village, it is more than five mu. Since my brother made a mistake, he has not been allowed to participate in the farmers' association and is treated as a struggle object everywhere. When working for others, people get three sheng of rice per labor day, but my family only gets half a sheng. Occasional services don't count, whether we earn rice or not, how much service we provide, none of that matters. Because my brother stumbled, we were labelled as a family to be struggled against, which is really unbearable. Based on the above situation, what kind of household am I exactly? I hope you can give me an answer.
        Sincerely,
          Respectfully,
              Bai Jianzhong, Yongzi Bian Village, Third District, Xiangyuan

    Comrade Bai Jianzhong: The information about your family situation is not detailed enough in your letter, and it is still impossible to determine your class status. You said that your life was better in 1946. If you had a considerable amount of land, draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production at that time, and engaged in agricultural labor yourself, or engaged in other independent labor as a sideline, as the main source of livelihood, if the actual situation is like this, you should be classified as middle peasant. Because your brother worked as an air-raid shelter for the landlord, a portion of your land was confiscated, and you were treated as a struggle object and had your salary reduced, this is wrong. You should raise your opinions to the farmers' association and the government to revise your class status. You should receive equal pay for equal work and cannot be arbitrarily reduced. Difficulties in production should be resolved first; other difficulties can be compensated for in future supplementation.

    给白建中降低工资是不对的
    编辑同志：
    我兄弟俩，父亲在时种有地四十四亩，人五口，民国十三年父亲去世，继母吸食金丹，每年靠卖家产过活。十八年上，只剩下二十一亩地，也典给人家，生活上简直是支锅没米，继母改嫁，我在我姐家度日，哥哥给人家住长工，嫂嫂给人家做饭，我姐家也因穷养不了我，十四岁上我便给人家放羊三年，十七上也住了长工。我哥除住长工外，还学了二年木匠，我二十二上在村守了二年庙，捎带给教员做饭，我哥抽空给人做木工，这样逐渐把典地抽回，还有一只驴，一九四三年因灾荒难渡，我开始参加工作，并在四六年也娶上妻室，生活上比以前好的多了，去年二月群运时，我哥给地主白聚宝当了防空洞，因之也牵连把我家地斗去四亩，驴也卖掉还了借粮，嫂嫂也因病去世。以现在说，家五口人，住三孔窑，种地二十亩，劳动力只有我哥一个，累着两个小孩（大的十三，小的八岁）和我那不健康的女人，按我村地的平均数每人五亩多，自我哥犯错误后，不叫参加农会，处处以斗争对象看待，给人家劳动，人家每工三升米，我家只升半，零星服务都不算数，赚米不赚米，服务多少，那不算啥，因我哥一失脚，就给顶上被斗户帽子，实在受不了。根据上述情况，我究竟算个啥户，请给一解答为盼。
        此致
          敬礼

    白建中同志：你的家庭情况，来信中所谈还不够详细，尚无法肯定是什么成份，你说四六年生活较好，这时若已有相当土地、耕畜、农具及其他生产资料，自己从事农业劳动，或兼营其他独立劳动的副业，作为主要生活来源的，如果实际情形如此，应是中农成份。因为你哥哥给地主当防空洞就没收你家一部分土地，并当斗争对象看待，减低工资，这是不对的，你应向农会及政府提出意见改订成份。做活应同工同酬，不能随便降低，生产困难应先给予解决；其他困难可到将来填补中再作补偿。
