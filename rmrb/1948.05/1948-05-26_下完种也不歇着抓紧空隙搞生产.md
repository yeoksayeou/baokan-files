　　After Sowing, Don't Rest, Seize Every Opportunity for Production

　　Maitiwan shifts to making heating platforms, preparing to topdress millet fields
    [Xingtai News] After completing sowing, Maitiwan Village, in the seventh district of Xingtai, has shifted its efforts to making heating platforms, producing fertilizer, transporting manure, and weeding, based on the needs of agricultural work. After the fourth group finished sowing, the work was not specific, and most people said there was no work, forming a situation where everyone did their own thing. On the evening of the 29th day of the third lunar month, Deputy Village Head Shen Fujin led a review meeting of all seventeen members of the group. After an evening of review, the following problems were discovered: Shen Huaiduo said: "Others don't work according to my wishes. The cotton sown for me later didn't turn out well. They only think about doing their own work when there is work to be done." Shen Zonglin said: "There are many adults in the group. Whenever we plan agricultural work, it's either a chaotic quarrel or no one speaks up, delaying time." Shen Zongzhang said: "The young people are too mischievous and delay work." Shen Zongfang said: "When I was weeding later, I wanted to weed better, but the weeding done for me was a mess, and some seedlings couldn't even be distinguished. Shen Wanshi clearly knows he's only doing eight-tenths of the labor, but he gets paid the same as full labor, and I don't want to say anything." After the review, the following solutions were discussed the next evening: (1) Those who cannot withstand full labor will be paid according to the work they do, regardless of personal feelings, to truly implement death division and live setting. (2) The mischievous youths voluntarily proposed that they would no longer be mischievous in the future. (3) Weeding should be done better. The work should be done according to the master's wishes, and the work should follow the master. (4) Sowing is a major event. Whether or not to catch seedlings should be based on the land conditions. Sowing should not be rigid but should be based on the plots. (5) There are many adults in the group. In the future, agricultural work should be planned separately, each calculating its own, and the group leader will mobilize when needed. After the problems were solved, everyone mentioned that if there was anything in the future, it should be brought up face to face to create a model mutual aid group. At the same time, the difficulties were studied. Among the fifteen households in the group, seven households, including Shen Fujin, lacked agricultural tools, which would cost 20,000 yuan at market prices. In addition, one household lacked seeds, totaling 23,000 yuan. These difficulties were solved through mutual borrowing. They are now continuing to make heating platforms, produce fertilizer, and transport manure, preparing to topdress the millet fields, with a very high production enthusiasm.

　　After completing sowing, all able-bodied laborers in Duanqu went out to sell labor
    [Shexian News] This spring, under the leadership and promotion of labor hero Shen Qibiao, Duanqu Village in the seventh district truly implemented voluntary mutual assistance. The village has fifty-eight able-bodied laborers and twenty-seven half-laborers. In the spring plowing and sowing, they combined agriculture and sideline occupations and have achieved remarkable results in the past two months. In agricultural production, the village has planted a total of 148.5 mu of cotton, 100.01 mu of upright millet, and 32,700 kilns of pumpkins. In sideline production, they earned 6,263 jin and three taels of rice and 166,000 yuan. After the whole village finished sowing, labor hero took the opportunity to lead the masses to turn to production for self-rescue and overcome famine, organizing all able-bodied laborers to go out to sell labor, and children and old men to weed cotton at home. After six days of work, all 148.5 mu of cotton in the village were weeded. They are now reclaiming wasteland and accumulating fertilizer.

　　Xigang plans to weed cotton and repair threshing grounds after planting
    [Another dispatch] After the spring rain on the 16th and 17th, Xigang Village in the ninth district immediately mobilized all its strength to carry out a blitz sowing. After two or three days of work, all 345 mu of white land were planted. Immediately following this, on the 11th and 12th, the Production Committee convened the masses to study life after sowing. After everyone's discussion and deliberation, they accepted the lesson learned last year when they could not plant after the wheat harvest due to lack of rain. This year, they will plant corn from the wheat fields. The Farmers' Association will lend the masses 170 jin of corn seeds. In addition, a five-day plan was discussed and formulated to weed all cotton fields, melon fields, and broom fields, and to repair the threshing grounds in preparation for the wheat harvest.

　　Piancheng strengthens leadership to promote fertilizer production and firewood gathering
    [Another dispatch] After completing sowing, there were constantly idlers sitting on the streets in Piancheng, Shexian, thinking, "Now that the land is sown, it's time to rest!" In order to overcome this phenomenon, the Production Command organized the surplus labor force to gather firewood and produce fertilizer. In order to exchange experiences in a timely manner, commend heroes and models, and improve publicity work, mass blackboards, mobile signs, and broadcasting stations were added to each street. Each street was responsible for collecting materials and publishing them independently to guide production. In addition, with the promotion of the group leaders and captains, the whole village gathered 12,000 jin of firewood in five days, preparing the firewood for weeding and wheat harvesting in advance to reduce the trouble during the busy season.

　　下完种也不歇着抓紧空隙搞生产
　　麦地湾转入换炕准备谷地上追肥
    【邢台消息】邢台七区麦地湾村，完成下种后，根据农活需要已转入换炕、造肥、运粪、锄苗等生活。第四组在下完种后，活不具体，多数都说没活，形成各做各的现象。古历三月二十九日晚上，副村长申福进领导召开了全组十七人的检讨会议，经一黄昏的检讨，发现下面几个问题：申怀夺说：“别人做活不随心，在后＠给我种的棉花就没出好，有活光想自己做”。申宗林说：“组大人多，每逢计划农活不是乱咯吵，就是没人吭，拖延时间”。申宗张说：“青年好调皮，也耽误做活”。申宗方说：“在后＠锄苗我心眼想锄好些哩，因给我锄的是乱七八糟，有的连苗也分不开，申万诗明白是八分劳力，也给全劳力一样赚晌，咱也不好吭”。检讨后，第二天晚上讨论解决：（一）顶不住全劳力的今后按做活赚晌票，丢下情面，确实实现死分活定。（二）好调皮的青年自动提出，今后再不调皮。（三）锄苗要锄好些，活由主便，做活要随主。（四）下种是个大事，要根据土地情况捉苗不捉苗，不能死板下种，要斟酌地块。（五）组大人多，今后计划农活分开，各计各的，需要的活再有组长调动。问题解决后，大家提到今后有啥当面提出，要搞个模范互助组。同时又研究了困难，全组十五户，内有申福进等七户缺农具，按市价需洋二万元，再加上一户缺籽种，总共需洋二万三千元。从互借中解决了这些困难，现正继续换炕造肥运粪，准备谷地上追肥，生产劲头十分高涨。（宗南、宗军、万忙）

　　偏城加强领导推动造肥打柴
    【又讯】涉县偏城完成下种后，街上不断坐着闲人，以为“种上地啦，该歇歇哩！”生产指挥部为克服这种现象，便组织剩余劳力打柴造肥。为了及时交流经验、表扬英雄模范，并健全了宣传工作，在各街增设大众黑板、流动牌、广播台，由各街负责收集材料自行出版指导生产，再加上各组长、队长推动全村五天打柴一万二千斤，将麦收锄苗中的烧柴准备妥当，以减少忙时麻烦。
