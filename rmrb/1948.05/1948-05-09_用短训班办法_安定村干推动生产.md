　　Using Short Training Courses to Stabilize Village Cadres and Promote Production

To the Editors:

　　Currently, the difficulty felt in the spring plowing movement in various places is the lack of enthusiasm among village cadres, who are not actively leading, resulting in production becoming laissez-faire. Furthermore, a small number of bad village cadres are resisting and causing trouble, which has a significant impact on production. Before widespread democratic party rectification is carried out in various places, how to solve this problem deserves attention.

　　Recently, we went to Julu and Pingxiang counties in Jinnan to understand the work of production and disaster relief. We found that these two counties, in order to smoothly carry out production, convened short-term training classes for village cadres to carry out preliminary party rectification from top to bottom, resolve their ideological concerns, and establish a correct working attitude, which has achieved some results. We believe that this approach is better in the current transitional period.

　　The method of the training class is to concentrate the main cadres of each village in the county for study (Pingxiang divided into two phases of rectification and training), for a period of about ten days. The steps taken are roughly the same as the party rectification of county and district cadres. When the county and district cadres went to the prefectural committee for party rectification in January of this year, the village cadres were unclear about the spirit of party rectification, and a small number of bad elements spread rumors that "many cadres were detained in Nangong and did not return." Therefore, they generally had a "waiting to be rectified" panic. When the county party committee notified them to attend the meeting, the village cadres were unwilling to go, fearing punishment, but they dared not not go. In the early stages of the meeting, they were unwilling to reflect, and there was resistance to "blaming the superiors," "we have made contributions in the past," "unwilling to be cadres," and "being a cadre has no good ending." The leadership repeatedly explained that the spirit of party rectification is to strive for transformation and education, not to attack; this time, the main focus is on reviewing mistakes and shortcomings, not on showing off merits, and at the same time exposing the serious mistakes of a small number of bad village cadres, explaining the need for thorough reflection. As a result, the thinking of the village cadres began to change, and those with minor mistakes reflected one after another. After praising those who reflected well and criticizing a few who resisted stubbornly, the reflection went a step further. Some cadres in Julu reflected on bad things that happened several years ago (of course, not thoroughly). After the mistakes were reflected, the ideological and emotional state of the village cadres changed greatly. Most of them initially realized their past mistakes, resolved the emotions of "blaming" and "not doing," felt that the superiors were kind and caring to them, and were in a relatively happy mood. Only a few who made serious mistakes were threatened with "punishment" and were unhappy. Regarding the issue of punishment, Julu County adopted the policy of no punishment or less punishment. Because this party rectification is not mass-based, it should be left to the masses to review them in the future before a decision is made. More than 1,000 village cadres in Julu participated in the study, only three people were punished; more than 1,000 village cadres in Pingxiang had more than 80 people punished.

　　After a short period of study, the village cadres understood the spirit of party rectification and the attitude of the superiors towards them. Most of them were in a better mood, and basically changed the "lying down" passive attitude. Finally, the village cadres all expressed their attitude at the meeting, saying: "We must work hard when we return to the village." The village cadres in Pingxiang County also held an oath-taking ceremony. In this study, the leading comrades of Pingxiang County paid special attention to resolving the village cadres' questions about "what is democracy" and "what is commandism," which is of great educational significance to the village cadres in terms of work style. After returning, the village cadres held mass meetings to reflect on past mistakes, and some even personally apologized to the people's homes. The masses' views on them have also changed somewhat (not fundamentally). Some said: "The village cadres have come back from the county meeting this time and are better than before!" At present, the loan work in various villages, in addition to the county and district cadres directly leading the masses, still allows the village cadres to participate in the leadership (not completely relying on them). Most of them are still active in production, but some are timid and afraid of making mistakes.

　　We believe that this short-term training class method solves two problems: (1) It enables village cadres to understand the spirit of party rectification, educates and saves most village cadres, so that they can continue to serve the people in this transitional period (before new village cadres are produced), so as not to create a state of rural anarchy, and at the same time lays some foundation for the future democratic party rectification movement. (2) Suppressing a small number of bad village cadres, so that they dare not take the opportunity to sabotage and make trouble. Due to the short time, the materials we have learned are simple. If there is any inconsistency with the facts, we will make corrections. Please Pingxiang and Julu County Party Committees report their experiences in detail. We hereby raise this issue, whether it is correct, please study.

### 用短训班办法　安定村干推动生产

　　用短训班办法
  　安定村干推动生产编辑同志：
    目前春耕运动中，各地感到的困难，是村干部情绪消沉，不积极领导，生产形成自流。更有少数坏村干部抵抗捣乱，对生产影响颇大。在各地尚未普遍进行民主整党前，如何解决这一问题，值得注意。
    最近我们到冀南巨鹿、平乡两县了解生产救灾工作，发现这两县为了顺利开展生产，召开村干短期训练班，进行自上而下的初步整党，解决其思想顾虑，树立正确的工作态度，得到一些效果，我们认为在目前过渡时期，这种作法是比较好。
    训练班的方式，是把各村主要干部都集中到县（平乡分两期整训），进行学习，时间十天左右。进行的步骤，和县区干部整党大体相同。今年一月县区干部去地委整党时，村干部对整党精神摸不清，又加上少数坏分子造谣说是“有许多干部扣在南宫没回来，”因此他们普遍存在着“等着挨整”的恐慌情绪。县委通知开会时，村干都不愿去，怕受处分，但又不敢不去，会议的初期，都不愿反省，存在着“抱怨上级”，“俺过去有功劳”，“不愿当干部”，“当干部没下场”的抵抗情绪。巨鹿村干说：“给群众戴高帽游街，光批评我们做的不对，这还不是上级叫这样做的？”领导上反复解释整党精神是争取改造教育，不是打击；这次主要是检讨错误缺点，不是表功，同时又揭发少数坏村干的严重错误，说明必须彻底反省。这样一来，村干部思想开始变化，错误小的纷纷反省，又经过表扬反省好的，批评少数顽抗的，反省就更深入一步。巨鹿有些干部把几年前的坏事都反省了（当然不彻底）。错误反省出来后，村干部的思想情绪有很大变化。大部分初步认识到自己过去的错误，解决了“抱怨”和“不干”的情绪，感觉上级对他们亲切爱护，精神比较愉快了。只有少数错误重大的被“处分”威胁着，不愉快。关于处分问题，巨鹿县采取不处分或少处分的方针。因为这次整党不是群众性的，应留待将来群众审查他们时再决定。巨鹿一千多村干部参加学习，只三个人受处分；平乡一千多村干部有八十多个受处分。
    经过短期学习，村干了解了整党精神和上级对他们的态度。大部分情绪好转，基本上改变了“躺倒”的消极态度。最后村干在会议上都表明态度说：“回村一定要好好工作”。平乡村干部还举行了宣誓。在这次学习中，平乡县的领导同志，特别注意解决村干对“什么是民主”，“什么是强迫命令”的疑问，这对村干部在作风上的教育意义很大。村干回去后，都召开群众会议反省过去错误，有的还亲自到群众家中道歉。群众对他们的看法也多少有些改变（不是根本改变）。有的说：“村干部这次从县上开会回来，比过去好啦！”目前各村的贷款贷粮工作，除县区干部直接领导群众进行外，仍让村干部参加领导（不是完全依靠他们），他们在生产中大部分表现尚积极，但有些胆小，怕犯错误。
    我们认为这种短期训练班的方式解决了两个问题：（一）使村干了解整党精神，教育与挽救了大部分村干部，在此过渡时期（新村干未产生前），能继续给人民服务，不致造成农村无政府状态，同时给将来的民主整党运动打下一些基础。（二）镇压少数坏村干，使其不敢乘机破坏捣乱。由于时间短促，我们了解的材料简单，若有与事实不符之处，再作修正。请平乡、巨鹿两县委详细报导他们的经验。我们谨将此问题提出，是否正确，请大家研究。
