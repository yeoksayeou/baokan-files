Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th—At the closing session of the Border Region Production Conference, Commander He Long elaborated on the issue of developing production. He first pointed out that production work over the past year has been successful. This can be summarized into two main aspects: (1) it has strongly supported the war; (2) it has solved the production difficulties of the masses, thus enabling them to combat famine. However, serious shortcomings still existed in the work of the past year. He particularly emphasized criticizing the erroneous leading ideology of some comrades in the financial and trade departments, who still believe that investing in production contradicts financial expenditure. Commander He Long said that the starting point of these comrades was to support the war and guarantee supplies, but this financial perspective is not comprehensive and is not unified with the mass perspective and the development of production. It cannot reflect the difficulties of the masses, and as a result, it will cause financial fluctuations, unstable prices, and be detrimental to the development of production. He proposed "Developing Production to Solve Finance," "Developing Production to Guarantee Supply," and "Developing Production to Stabilize Finance" as the general guidelines for future financial and economic work. He said that a comprehensive financial perspective must be consistent with the mass perspective, and to be consistent, it is necessary to develop production. He also criticized the financial and trade organs for using too little force in developing production in the past. The vast majority of the bank's strength was used for financial expenditure, and the trade companies and state-owned stores only focused on completing financial tasks, with insufficient help in developing production. Financial and trade work was suspended in the air, without taking root among the masses. He said that the main tasks of our banks and trade companies should be "developing production, stabilizing finance, and stabilizing prices." He advocated that the tasks of the financial and trade departments and the financial departments must be clearly divided. Banks, trade companies, and state-owned stores should be solely responsible for developing production, stabilizing finance, and stabilizing prices, and should not bear financial tasks. Financial expenditure should only establish a loan relationship. With such a division of tasks, the so-called contradiction will be easier to resolve. He said that agricultural currency is a tool and should play these four roles: (1) developing production; (2) fighting against Chiang currency and silver dollars; (3) acting as a medium to change the state of bartering; (4) acting as a storage. Now, agricultural currency has not played its due role, and therefore cannot take root among the masses. He called on everyone to come together to reorganize finance, to store materials in a planned way, and to sell materials to tighten the currency supply. What is particularly important is to combine agricultural currency with the production of the vast number of farmers who have obtained land after the land reform, to invest heavily in rural production, and to develop rural exchange, to run beneficial or unprofitable loans, so that agricultural currency can go to the countryside.

    He said with confidence that we are fully capable of reorganizing finance and combining it with the production of the vast number of farmers who have obtained land. This is the first strong guarantee. The second is that the bank has strong funds. Furthermore, after the land reform, the financial speculation and illegal smuggling of landlords, rich peasants, and economic counter-revolutionaries have been greatly reduced. Also, it depends on the comrades attending the meeting and the comrades in the financial and economic departments to understand the idea of developing production. Regarding trade policy, he reiterated the principle of internal freedom and external management, and foreign exchange should also be strictly managed. He said that this policy is based on benefiting the people's development of production. Internally, we must resolutely implement the policy of free trade to develop exchange and prosper the market. Externally, we must see which needs to be exported and reward exports, and not allow exports that should not be exported. Necessities should be allowed to be imported, and non-essential luxuries should not be allowed to come in. Foreign exchange management is also based on needs and cannot be supplied without restriction to all foreign exchange.

    The main task of future tax collection is also to protect production. He criticized the serious mistake of the past tax collection that protected production less and damaged production more. Especially the business tax, which not only exceeded the prescribed collection last year, but also collected what should not have been collected. This error is now being gradually corrected.

    Regarding production work, Commander He Long particularly emphasized that it must be planned, organized, and led. He said that last year there was famine, drought, and grain shortage, and now grain is expensive and cloth is cheap. If there is no plan, organization, or leadership, cotton planting will be reduced this year, and textile production will be suspended. In the autumn, farmers will have to exchange grain for cloth to wear, and they will suffer a great loss. Therefore, there must be an overall plan, and it cannot be allowed to drift. He said that it is not enough to just generally call for the development of production. It is necessary to formulate practical plans according to the specific conditions of each region. It is not okay to have no plan, and it is not okay to have a plan that is not practical. For example, last year, the Second Sub-district did not investigate and study the source of cotton, the sales of cloth, and the teachers of the training class, etc., and then proposed to develop 20,000 looms within two years, which is not practical. All kinds of production must also calculate the output and sales of products, and study and improve technology. Producing more grain will still be the central link of all production work this year and in the next few years. He also attached great importance to sideline production, saying that farmers cannot turn over just by getting land. They must vigorously promote the development of sideline production, organize women to raise chickens, pigs, and silkworms, and attach importance to the development of animal husbandry and various family sideline production, etc. If the income from sideline production can reach 20% to 30% of the agricultural income, farmers can turn over.

    Regarding the issue of famine, Commander He Long reminded everyone to pay great attention and mobilize all forces to fight against famine. He said to tell the farmers, "Prevent famine and drought every year." Try to save surplus money and rice, otherwise there will be no way to deal with famine years. He proposed that organs should strive to develop agriculture, handicrafts, or engage in workshops, transportation, and other sideline industries, and should not engage in speculative smuggling and illegal business. Some units burned several gullies of forests in order to plant land, which is illegal. Each special commissioner's office should send people to manage the forests, and whoever cuts down one tree must plant ten trees. Commander He Long finally said: After developing production in this way, the farmers will turn over and have a closer relationship with the Communist Party, and they will also love the government more, and it will be much easier to hand in public grain. With more materials and more foreign exchange, financial and material prices will be stabilized, and banks and trade companies will also stand on the ground from the air. In this way, solving finance, guaranteeing supply, and stabilizing finance through the development of production, all contradictory problems can be solved.

    贺龙同志详论发展生产问题
    提出财经建设方针
    强调生产须有计划有组织有领导
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】边区生产会议闭幕会上，贺龙司令员详论发展生产问题，他首先指出，过去一年来生产工作是有成绩的，这可归纳为两个主要内容，即（一）有力的支援了战争；（二）解决了群众生产困难，因而能与灾荒作了斗争。但在去年一年的工作中，还存在着严重的缺点，他特别着重批评金融贸易部门某些同志迄今仍认为投资生产与财政开支互相矛盾的错误领导思想。贺司令员说，这些同志出发点是为了支援战争，保证供给，但这种财政观点是不全面的，没有与群众观点和发展生产统一起来，不能反映群众的困难，因而结果就会使金融波动，物价不稳，不利于发展生产，财政供给也会更加困难。他提出“发展生产解决财政”、“发展生产保证供给”、“发展生产稳定金融”为今后财经工作的总方针。他说全面的财政观点必须是与群众观点一致的，而要一致就必须发展生产。他又批评了金融贸易机关过去用于发展生产的力量太少，银行绝大部分力量用于财政开支，贸易公司与公营商店也只顾完成财政任务，帮助发展生产很不够。金融贸易工作悬在空中，没有在群众中生根。他说，我们银行与贸易公司的主要任务应该是“发展生产，稳定金融，平定物价。”他主张金融贸易部门与财政部门之任务须划分清楚，银行、贸易公司、公营商店专管发展生产，稳定金融，平定物价，不负担财政任务。而对财政开支只是建立借款的关系。这样划分好任务所谓矛盾就比较好解决。他说农币乃是一种工具，应当发挥这样四种作用：（一）发展生产。（二）与蒋币、白洋作斗争。（三）媒介作用，改变以物易物状态。（四）储存作用。现在农币没有起它应有的作用，因而不能在群众中生根。他号召大家起来整理金融，要有计划地储存物资，抛售物资，以紧缩通货。而特别重要的应使农币与土改后广大得地农民的生产结合起来，要大量投资农村生产，并发展农村交换，举办有利或无利的借贷，使农币下乡。
    他充满信心的说，我们完全有力量把金融整理好，与广大得地农民的生产相结合，乃是第一个有力的保证，其次是银行有雄厚的资金，再就是经过土地改革，地主、富农与经济反革命的金融投机、违法走私的事大大减少了，还有就是靠与会同志和财经部门的同志弄通发展生产的思想。他对于贸易政策，重申对内自由、对外管理的原则，对外汇也应严加管理。他说，这样政策是以有利于人民发展生产为依归的，对内应坚决执行贸易自由政策，以发展交换，繁荣市场。对外要看那些需要出口的就奖励出口，不应出口的就不准出口，必需品应允许入口，非必需的奢侈品就不准进来。外汇管理也是根据需要，不能无限制的供给一切外汇。
    今后的税收工作主要任务也是为了保护生产。他批评了过去的税收保护生产少而破坏生产多的严重错误。特别是营业税，去年不仅超出规定征收，且不应征的也征了。此种错误目前已经逐渐纠正了。
    对于生产工作，贺司令员特别强调必须有计划、有组织、有领导。他说去年荒旱粮缺，现在粮贵布贱，如无计划、组织、领导，今年种棉减少，纺织停顿，秋后农民再拿粮食换布穿，又要吃很大亏。所以必须要有整个计划，不能听其自流。他说光是一般号召发展生产是不行的，必须要按各地具体条件订出切合实际的计划，没有计划是不行的，有计划而不切合实际也是不行的。如去年二分区未调查研究棉花来源、布的销路、训练班的教师等问题，即提出两年内发展两万架织布机，是不合实际的。各种生产也都要计算产品的产量、销路及研究、改进技术。多产粮食，这在今年以至若干年内仍是一切生产工作的中心环节。他也十分重视副业生产说，农民光得土地这翻不了身，必须大力提倡发展副业，组织妇女养鸡、养猪、养蚕，重视牧畜业及各种家庭副业的发展等。如果副业收入能达到农业收入的百分之二十到三十，农民就可以翻身了。
    关于灾荒问题，贺司令员提醒大家必须十分重视，动员一切力量与灾荒作斗争。他说要告诉农民“年年防荒旱。”设法积存余钱余米，否则遇荒年就没有办法。他对机关生产提出要努力发展农业、手工业、或搞作坊、运输及其他副业，不准搞投机走私违法生意。有的单位为了种地烧了几条沟的树林，这是犯法的。各专署要派人管理森林，谁砍一棵，就要栽十棵。贺司令员最后说：这样发展生产之后，农民翻了身对共产党关系更密切，对政府也更爱护，交点公粮也容易得多了。物资多了，外汇也有了，金融物价也稳定了，银行贸易公司也从空中站到了地上，这样从发展生产来解决财政，保证供给，稳定金融，一切矛盾问题都可以得到解决。
