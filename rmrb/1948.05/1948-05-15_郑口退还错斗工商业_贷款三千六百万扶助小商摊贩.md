    Zhengkou Returns Wrongfully Confiscated Industrial and Commercial Property; Loans 36 Million to Support Small Vendors
    [Jinan News] During the review in Zhengkou Town, Gucheng County, last year, the leadership's policies towards industry and commerce were not clear enough. They generally believed that without struggling against industry and commerce, landlords could not be thoroughly eliminated, so they led the masses in struggle. Of the 400 shops in the town, 41 were struggled against, and 17 were so frightened that they offered up their property. In total, 58 households (not including those struggled against by the masses in various towns) were affected. These 58 households were merged by the masses into 21 households, collectively referred to as "Guang Zi Hao." The masses elected 11 representatives to serve as managers, who, together with the old shop assistants, opened for business. Many restrictions were placed on industry and commerce, such as dismissing all cadres and shop assistants with landlord or rich peasant backgrounds and sending them home. Except for some freedom for general shop assistants, managers could not resign or quit their jobs casually, etc.
    These regulations greatly restricted merchants. In addition, each store was assigned mass managers, who actually had no business experience. Shop assistants reflected: "They can't manage big things, but they manage small things very tightly," which also restricted the free competition and development of industry and commerce. The market was stagnant, business was sluggish, and small and medium-sized merchants and the poor felt that there was little buying and selling, making it impossible to maintain a living. For example, the Jianmin Photo Studio did not open for half a month; Xiao Cheng, a barber, also complained: "In the past, merchants would get a haircut every half month and a shave every five days, but who gets a haircut now?" An old woman named Zhang in Xicheng Town originally relied on washing clothes for a living, but after the struggle, she had no means of support. Before the struggle, there were more than 130 porters, but now even 60 or 70 people are not very busy. A poor porter said: "In the past, I could earn about 1,000 yuan a day to support my whole family. I was very active during the struggle, hoping to turn over, but unexpectedly, after the struggle, I only received tens of thousands of yuan in fruits, and now that the money is used up, there is nowhere to sell my labor."
    In order to correct past mistakes and make Zhengkou's industry and commerce develop and prosper, the county and district jointly organized a working committee. After in-depth investigation and research and with the approval of the prefectural committee, a symposium of merchants was held on April 23. Zhao, the county secretary, formally announced at the meeting that the wrongfully confiscated industrial and commercial property would be returned to the original owners for free operation and protected by government laws. The merchants were very happy to hear this. The vice chairman of the Commercial Federation said: "In the past, we only talked about protection, but there was no factual evidence; now that it has been returned, the merchants really believe it." County Secretary Zhao finally explained: In the future, business tax will be reduced as much as possible, and the government will not only protect industry and commerce by law, but also provide loan support. Road passes will be abolished in the liberated areas, and everyone can come and go freely, etc. The merchants were even happier and said: "These three things alone can make Zhengkou prosperous." At the same time, in order to solve the difficulties of small vendors and small merchants (within the five towns of Zhengkou), a non-fixed-term low-interest loan of 36 million yuan was issued. Now, merchant representatives, mass representatives, and cadres of the Commercial Federation, in cooperation with county and district cadres, are inspecting goods, handling handovers, and providing loans, etc., and the whole town is very active.

  Fugitive Merchants Hear the News and Return to Open for Business
    Another message: Since the Gucheng County Government officially issued a notice on April 25, stating that Zhengkou's industrial and commercial property (excluding that of traitors) would be returned, some merchants who had been struggled against or had fled to the KMT-controlled areas or returned home out of fear of being struggled against have returned (according to statistics on the 27th, nine have already returned, and some others have returned but have not yet reported to the Commercial Federation) to take over their goods and prepare to continue opening for business. In order to ensure that the goods are returned to the original owners and to prevent individual managers or shop assistants from impersonating or harming the owners, the government has formulated the following receiving methods: 1. If both the owner and the manager are present, they can receive the goods immediately. 2. If the manager is not present but the owner has come, they can receive the goods as long as they guarantee to continue opening for business and not to transfer or stop operating. 3. If the owner has not come but the manager and shop assistants are present, the government will temporarily manage the goods on their behalf and entrust a reliable person to receive and operate them. The government will hand them over to the owner as soon as they arrive. 4. If many owners have not all come, the shares of those who have come will be handed over, but if there are elderly and weak people who are indeed unable to come, they can also receive the goods as long as they have written proof or other procedures. 5. After receiving the goods, they must register with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and obtain a business license to open for business as usual.
    The handover procedures such as inventory and price fixing are currently underway smoothly in various stores. The merchants say with great confidence: "If this is done well, Zhengkou will be very prosperous and look like it by the Dragon Boat Festival (May Festival)."

### 郑口退还错斗工商业  贷款三千六百万扶助小商摊贩

    郑口退还错斗工商业
    贷款三千六百万扶助小商摊贩
    【冀南消息】故城郑口镇在去年复查时，由于领导上对工商业政策不够明确，总认为不斗工商业不能彻底消灭地主，便领导群众进行了斗争。全镇共有商店四百户，斗了四十一户，有十七户吓得献出财物，共五十八户（各镇群众自斗的未计在内）。这五十八户，群众把他合并成二十一户，统称为“广字号”，由群众选出代表十一人当经理，结合老店员开张营业，并定出许多限制工商业的规矩，把地主富农成份的职、店员一律停职回家，除一般店员稍有自由外，经理均不能随便辞职不干等。
    这些规定，给商人很大限制，再加上各商店派有群众经理，这些人实际没有经商经验，职、店员反映：“大事管不了，小事管的挺紧”，也限制了工商业的自由竞争和发展。市面死气沉沉，营业萧条，中小商人及贫民均感到买卖少，无法维持生活。如建民照像馆，半月没开张；剃头的小成也叫苦说：“过去商人半月一剃头，五天一刮脸，现在谁还剃呢？”西成镇一个张老太太，原靠洗衣服吃饭，斗争后生活无依靠了。斗争前脚行一百三十多人，现在六七十人还不很忙，一个脚行贫民说：“过去我每天能得一千元左右，养活全家人，斗争时我很积极，指望翻身，不料斗后只分了几万元的果实，现把钱用完也没处去卖力气了。”
    为了纠正过去错误，使郑口工商业发展繁荣起来，县区共同组织一工作委员会，经过深入的调查研究及地委会的批准，于四月二十三日召开商人座谈会，赵县书在会上正式宣布了退回错斗工商业财产，归原主自由经营，并受政府法律保护。商人听说都很高兴。商联会副主任说：“过去光说保护，没有事实证明；现在一退，商人便真相信了。”赵县书最后又说明：今后营业税尽量减轻，政府对工商业除以法律保护外，并贷款支持，在解放区内取消路条，大家自由来往等。商人更高兴的说：“只这三条也能使郑口繁荣了。”同时为了解决小摊贩小商人的困难（光郑口内五镇），又发放了三千六百万元的不定期低利贷款。现在商人代表、群众代表、商联会干部配合县区干部，正在进行检查货物，办理接交及贷款等工作，全镇空气很活跃。
  逃亡商人听到消息  纷纷回来开张营业
    又息：故城县政府，自四月廿五号正式出布告：声明退还郑口工商业（汉奸除外）以后，一些被斗及因怕斗而逃亡到蒋管区或回家的商人，都纷纷回来（据二十七号统计已回来九家，还有好些回来还未向商联会报告的），接收货物准备继续开张。政府为了保证货物退给原主，防止个别经理或职、店员冒名顶替，坑害东家等情形发生，定出几项接收办法如下：一、东家经理都在者，马上能接收。二、经理不在光东家来了，只要保证继续开张，不转移或停止营业者也能接收。三、东家未来光经理职店员在者，政府暂为代管，委托可靠专人接收经营，东家啥时来了，政府啥时即交给本人。四、如东家很多未全来，来几股即交几股，但有老弱确系不能来者，只要有本人文字或其他手续证明也能接收。五、接收后即向工商局登记领取营业证照常开张营业。
    现各商店正在顺利进行盘货划价等接交手续，商人都很有信心的说：“这样一办，等不到吃粽子（五月节），郑口就能繁荣的很象样子了。”
