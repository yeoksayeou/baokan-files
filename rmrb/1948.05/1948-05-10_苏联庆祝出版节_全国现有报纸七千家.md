Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Moscow dispatch: May 5th is the Soviet Union's Publication Festival, and also the 36th anniversary of the publication of *Pravda*. The entire Soviet publishing industry celebrated enthusiastically. TASS released statistics on this day saying: Currently, the Soviet Union has 7,000 central and local newspapers, with a total circulation of 31 million copies, published in 80 national languages of the Soviet Union (of which 20 ethnic groups did not have their own written language before the revolution). "The huge increase in Soviet newspapers most vividly demonstrates socialist democracy and genuine freedom of the press" (TASS). Last year, the total sales of books and periodicals were five times that of 1913 and twice that of 1940. In the past 30 years, a total of 889,000 kinds of books have been published, totaling 11.5 billion copies. In the past 20 years, a total of 70,000 kinds of literary works have been printed, totaling more than 1 billion copies, of which one-third are works by writers from ethnic groups outside of Russia. The Soviet Union pays special attention to the education of the younger generation, and textbooks account for one-fourth of all Soviet publications.
