To the Editor:

Regarding the compensation for wrongly struggled middle peasants, I have several questions I would like answered:

1.  During the struggle, the middle peasant's family property was not confiscated, but under pressure from the masses, they personally sold their property to exchange for food to hand over to the masses. How should this be compensated? If the government allows the land to be recovered, but the buyer does not agree, what should be done?

2.  During the struggle against middle peasants, in addition to houses and land, should other furniture, food, livestock, etc., also be compensated? What is the method of compensation?

3.  The property of wrongly struggled middle peasants has already been distributed. What should be done if it was distributed to poor peasants and hired laborers? What should be done if it was distributed to middle peasants? What should be done if it was distributed to cadres, or seized by cadres through threats or purchases?

4.  Under the call for uniting with the middle peasants, when compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants, does the household have full disposal rights over its original property?

5.  During the struggle, the industry and commerce of middle peasants or landlords were confiscated, and the masses distributed or consumed them. How should compensation be made now? If the owner of the industry and commerce has died, should it also be returned? If the returned industry and commerce owner is temporarily unwilling or unable to operate, what should be done?

6.  Some have more land but fewer people, but have not collected rent, nor have they used long-term laborers, only using some short-term laborers when busy or plowing some of the land out (only managing hoeing and harvesting, while the landlord himself does the plowing, harrowing, and sowing). How should class be determined at this time? Some have less land than the village average, but do not rely solely on land income, but rent out the land to collect rent for a living. How should class be determined at this time?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Xu Gengsheng, Cixian

Comrade Xu Gengsheng:

1.  When middle peasants are threatened and hand over land and property during struggle, even if it is not formally confiscated, it is still a violation of the middle peasant policy. Because during land reform, the property of middle peasants must be protected, and a small amount of surplus land from some wealthy middle peasants can only be redistributed with their consent. Therefore, the losses suffered by these households you mentioned should be compensated. If the replenishment has not yet been carried out, and their lives and production can still be maintained, the problem can be postponed to the replenishment process. Otherwise, they must first be given the necessary production and living materials. If the replenishment has already been carried out, you can adopt a united and negotiated approach to compensate them. If there are difficulties, there is no need to insist on returning the original items. As you said, if the land has already been sold to someone else, it can be handled according to the specific situation. If he was originally a wealthy middle peasant, and now does not lack land, he can be persuaded and mobilized not to recover the original land, or given other compensation. If his land is insufficient, he should be supplemented with appropriate land (but not necessarily returning the original land).

2.  Livestock, grain, and other items of wrongly struggled middle peasants should also be compensated. The compensation method can be determined based on the specific situation. If the old middle peasant's property remains untouched, it should be returned in full; if it has been distributed, appropriate compensation can be given through negotiation in other fruits.

3.  Things taken from wrongly struggled middle peasants, or from cadres, if not much in the way of benefits, can be resolved appropriately through negotiation, and when it is not easy to take them back, benefits seized by cadres through coercion or threats, whether from middle peasants or landlords and rich peasants, should be resolutely returned.

4.  The original property of the wrongly struggled middle peasants that you refer to, it is not known whether it is the property that was struggled out or the part that was not struggled. They, of course, have the right to dispose of the part that was not struggled. The wrongly struggled part should be handled according to the principles discussed above.

5.  If the industry and commerce of middle peasants or landlords were confiscated, and if it was distributed but not yet consumed, it should still be returned. If it has already been consumed, the method of repayment and compensation can be determined according to the situation. It is essential to enable the original owner to resume business. If the capital is insufficient and they are unable to operate, the government should provide assistance with low-interest or interest-free loans. Those who are unwilling to operate must be persuaded, because returning it to them is for them to continue operating. If the owner of the industry and commerce has died, it can be returned to their heirs. If there is no heir, it can be handed over to the higher-level government for handling, depending on the size of the industry and commerce.

6.  The two situations you mentioned are not sufficiently detailed to determine their class. As for the former, exactly how much more land is there? What is the amount of exploitation from the plowed land? In principle, if a farmer owns land exceeding the average owned by general middle peasants by one or more times, but less than two times, and the income from feudal exploitation exceeds one-eighth of their total income, they can be considered rich peasants. If it exceeds two or more times, and their exploitation does not exceed one-eighth of their total income, they are also rich peasants. As for the latter, what exactly is his profession? Does he rely primarily on rent or on income from his profession for a living? Is his professional income independent? His class should be determined based on these specific conditions.

Title: How to Classify the Four Family Components

To the Editor:

We have a few questions we hope you can answer:

1. Hao Fa Hai - No one in the family participates in labor. He was the village head in the old society. Before the war, he studied. When the enemy came, he became a puppet village chief, not participating in labor. His wife does not work in the fields but does spinning and weaving, enough for her own use. Does this family count as having labor power?

2. Wang Chun - He studied before the war and became a cadre after the war. No one in the family participates in labor. They have seventeen mu of land, seven mu of which are farmed by his brother. Separately, his brother-in-law farms eight mu, and four mu are farmed by others on their behalf. Does farming by relatives count as exploitation? Does his participation in work count as labor power? How should this be calculated?

3. Hao De Wang - Before 1939, he did not separate from the family. He worked as a teacher outside. His father and brothers worked at home, employing two people and a shepherd, counting as a rich peasant. In 1939, he separated from the family and still worked as a teacher outside. There is no labor power at home. He and his father are together, and his father is old, capable of one-quarter of the labor power. Does he count as labor power? If he counts as labor power, he is a well-to-do middle peasant. If he does not count as labor power, he is a rich peasant. According to the central regulations, the family component of people is determined by their source of livelihood. If his family mainly relies on the land for a living, not on his teacher income, what component is he?

4. In Dong Village, there is a household called Duan Qingnian. He studied before the war and became a teacher after the war. The family employs people and rents out land. Does he count as a laborer? Also, should he be counted with his family? If he is counted with his family, he is a rich peasant. If he is not counted, he is a landlord. How should such landlords who are teachers be classified?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wuxiang Joint Office

Wuxiang Joint Office:

1. Hao Fa Hai's wife's spinning and weaving counts as labor, but not as agricultural labor. When calculating total income, income from non-agricultural labor must also be included. A distinction must be made between "having labor" and "having labor power." If Hao Fa Hai is between the ages of eighteen and fifty, he counts as a full laborer; but if he does not work, he cannot be considered "having labor."

2. Wang Chun studied before the war and became a cadre after the war. His own component is revolutionary staff. If his brother farms the land voluntarily, it does not count as exploitation. The same applies to relatives farming the land. His participation in work counts as mental labor, but according to regulations, it is not considered as his family having labor power. Instead, it should be said: "The family members of revolutionary staff who rent out or hire labor to cultivate land because they have no or lack labor power should not be considered exploitation." According to this, even if it is not his brother or relatives farming the land for him, renting out land or hiring labor to cultivate land because there is no labor power should not be considered exploitation.

3. Based on the conditions described in the letter, Hao De Wang's family component before 1939 cannot be determined yet. It depends on whether the labor power of his father and brothers is equal to the labor power of the two employees. It depends on whether "employing two people" means both are long-term farm laborers. If the labor power of the hired laborers is equal to or exceeds the labor of the employer, plus the exploitation of employing a shepherd, the exploitation income exceeds one-quarter of the total income. If this continues for more than three years, it counts as a rich peasant. If his entire or main source of livelihood comes from being a teacher, his own component should be that of a freelancer. After 1939, according to the situation described in the letter, there is no full labor power in the family. Then it depends on the status of land and property ownership and living conditions. If the land and property do not exceed that of a general middle peasant, and being a teacher is only for self-sufficiency, with no other labor power in the family, and the income from renting out land or hiring labor is only enough to maintain the same living as a general middle peasant, then the entire family's component is determined by his, counting as a freelancer. He himself counts as a mental laborer, but not as having agricultural labor power. His family also has no one participating in main agricultural labor, so he does not count as a peasant, let alone a rich peasant. Duan Qingnian's component should also be determined according to this principle. However, if the family's land and property exceed that of middle peasants by a lot, and their living is also much better than that of middle peasants, then it must be counted as a freelancer and landlord. His property that is not connected to the landlord's land should be protected.

In addition, the letter also mentioned the issue of the "Peasant Congress," which will be answered separately.

### 关于补偿中农的几个问题答徐更生同志

第2版()
专栏：编读往来

    关于补偿中农的几个问题答徐更生同志编辑同志：
    关于补偿错斗中农我有几个问题请解答：
    一、在斗争时中农家产不是没收的而是在群众压力下把家产亲自卖掉换成食粮交给群众的，这样该怎样补偿？如政府许可收回土地买主不许可又怎办？
    二、在斗争中农时除房屋土地外其他家具食粮牲畜等是否也要补偿，怎样补偿法？
    三、错斗的中农家产已经分配了，分配给贫雇的怎样办？分配给中农的怎样办？分配给干部了或被干部威胁收买、霸占了，又该怎么办？
    四、在团结中农的号召下，补偿错斗中农时，该户对于自己原有财产是否有充分处理权？
    五、在斗争时没收了中农或地主的工商业，群众分配了或消耗了，现在怎样补偿？工商业主人死过了是否也要退还？退还工商业主暂时不愿经营或无力经营时又该怎样办？
    六、有的土地多人口少但没有收过租，又没有用过长工，仅在忙时候用些短工或把一部分地拨锄出去（光管锄割，收打犁耙耩种还是地主自己劳动），这时划阶级时怎样划法？有的土地不到全村平均土地数，但他本人不专靠土地收入过活，而把土地租出去收租过活的，这时划阶级该怎样？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县读者徐更生徐更生同志：
    一、斗争中中农受到威胁拿出土地财产，虽形式上不是没收，但也是违犯中农政策的，因为土改中，中农的财产必须保护，一部分富裕中农有少数多余土地，也必须经他们同意才能抽动。因之你提的这些户所受到和损失是应补偿的。若目前尚未进行填补，而他们生活生产尚可维持下去，问题便可推迟到填补中解决，否则一定先给他们必要的生产生活资料。若已进行填补，可以采取团结协商的方式补偿他们，若有困难不必坚持退还原物。如你所说的，土地已经卖给别人，这时就可根据具体情况处理，假使他原系富裕中农，而现在又不缺土地时，可以说服动员他不再收回原来土地，或给以其他的补偿。若他土地不足，则应补以适当土地（但不一定退还原地）。
    二、错斗中农的牲口粮食等也要补偿。补偿办法可看具体情况决定，老中农的财产还原封未动，则应该全数退还；若已分散则可在其他果实中，以协商方式予以适当补偿。
    三、错斗中农的东西，或干部，若不是多得果实，可用协商办法，适当解决，而抽动又不容易时，干部霸占或威胁收买的果实，不管是中农的或地主富农的都应坚决退出。
    四、你所指的错斗中农的原有财产，不知是错斗出的还是未斗的部分。未斗的部分他们当然有权处理。错斗的应按前面谈的原则处理。
    五、没收中农或地主的工商业，若分配了还未消耗完，仍应退还，若已消耗，可看情况决定追补和补偿办法，一定要使原主能重新恢复营业，若资本不足无力经营时，政府应以低利或无利贷款扶助。不愿经营的一定要说服他们，因为退还他们就是为了让他们继续经营。工商业主人已死的可退给其继承人。无人继承的可看工商业规模的大小交上级政府处理。
    六、你所说的这两种材料都不充分，无法判定他们的阶级。如前一个，究竟土地多出多少？拨锄的剥削数目大小如何？原则上若农民占有土地超过一般中农平均所有一倍或一倍以上，二倍以下，则封建剥削收入超过其总收入八分之一的就可构成富农成份，若超过二倍或二倍以上，其剥削不超过总收入八分之一的也是富农。后面提的究竟他本人是什么职业？他的生活是以收租或以职业收入为主？他的职业收入有无独立性？他本人的成份应根据这些具体条件来确定。

    　　　　四个家庭成份的划法编辑同志：
    我们有这样几个问题希解答一下：
    一、郝发孩——家中没人参加劳动，在旧社会当村长，战前读书，敌人来时又当伪材长，不参加劳动。他老婆不上地，可是纺织，能供自己穿用。这家算不算有劳动力？
    二、王春——战前念书，战后当干部，家中无人参加劳动，有地十七亩，靠他哥哥种的七亩。另开家，他妹夫种八亩，代种的四亩，亲戚哥哥种地算不算剥削？他参加工作是不是顶劳力？这如何计算？
    三、郝德旺——在三九年前未另家，他在外当教员，家中有他父亲和他兄弟劳动，并用人二个，羊工一个，算富农。三九年另开家，他仍在外当教员，家中无劳力，他和他父伙的，他父年老能顶四分之一劳力，他是否算劳力？如算劳力者，即是富裕中农。如不算劳力，即是富农。按中央规定，决定人们家庭成份按他的生活来源，他的家庭主要是靠土地过生活，不靠他当教员收入，算什成份？
    四、东村有一户叫段青年，战前念书，战后当教员，家中用人和出租土地，他是否算劳动者？另外是否和家中算？如和家中算，即是富农，不算即是地主。象这样地主的教员该如何划？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　武乡联合办公室武乡联合办公室：
    一、郝发孩老婆纺织算有劳动，可是不算农业劳动。在计算总收入时，不是农业劳动的所得也要计入。“有劳动”与“有劳动力”要分清楚。郝发孩如果是十八岁以上、五十岁以下，他就算个全劳力；但他如果不劳动，就不能算“有劳动”。
    二、王春战前念书、战后当干部，他本人的成份是革命职员。哥哥种地如果是自愿的，不能算是剥削，亲戚给种地也同样。他参加工作算是脑力劳动，但按规定不是作为他家里有劳动力，而应该这样说：“革命职员家属因为没有或缺少劳动力而出租或雇工耕种土地者，不得认为剥削行为。”按这来说，他家即使不是哥哥、亲戚代种地，因没劳动力而出租地或雇工种地，也不能算剥削。
    三、郝德旺三九年前家中成份，照来信所说的条件，还不能确定，要看他父亲和兄弟的劳动力和两个雇工的劳动力是不是相等，要看“用人两个”是不是都是上地的长工；如果雇农与雇主劳动力相等，或雇农劳动力超过雇主的劳动，另加上雇羊工的剥削，剥削收入就超过总收入的四分之一了。这样连续三年以上，就算富农。他本人如果是靠当教员作为全部或主要生活来源，本人的成份应为自由职业者。三九年后，照来信所说的情形，家中没有全劳动力，那就要看土地财产占有状况及生活状况，如果土地财产不超过一般中农，当教员仅是自给，家中无别的劳动力，出租土地或雇工种地的收入仅足以维持和一般中农相同的生活，则全家成份都跟他划，算是自由职业者。他本人算脑力劳动者，但不算有农业劳动力，他家也没有人参加主要农业劳动，所以不算农民，更不算富农。段青年的成份也应根据这个原则给他确定。但如果家庭土地财产超过中农很多，生活也比中农好的多，那就得算自由职业者兼地主。他的不和地主土地相连的财产，应受保护。
    另外，来信还谈到关于“农代会”的问题，另作答复。
