　　【Taiyue News】After the Fifth District of Quwo convened a meeting of village cadres on the 26th of last month, the cadres of Tingcheng Village realized that leftist reckless actions were not good. After returning to the village, they convened a mass meeting to discuss correcting the deviations. Everyone understood the compensation for the losses of middle peasants, but it was very difficult to understand the return of property of landlords, rich peasants, and industrialists and merchants. Some people said, "If landlords and rich peasants have businesses, won't they just be enjoying themselves again?" Li Wenhai's wife said, "This time, the landlords have been let off too easy!" After discussion, everyone began to think from a long-term perspective. Xie Xusheng said, "If we only look at the present, it would be better not to return it; but if we look further ahead, it is better to give the business back to them. If we don't, no one in the village will dare to engage in industry and commerce in the future. When businessmen from big places (referring to big cities) see our People's Liberation Army coming, they will also 'collapse' their businesses. If businesses all collapse, and we can't buy anything, what good will that do for us ordinary people?" After some arguing, most people agreed to return the property. In the past, the village had struggled against two handicraft businesses: a vinegar workshop and a wood shop. The owner of the vinegar workshop ran away after being struggled against and hasn't returned yet. Everyone decided to send him a letter, asking him to come back and do business properly. As for the other wood shop, the wood was completely untouched, and both the furniture and the house were returned to the original owner. After resolving things in this way, the masses generally thought it was the right thing to do. Poor peasant Zhang Dingguo said, "It seems that the Communist Party really corrects its mistakes and is always planning for the people!"

　　听城村退还木铺
  　“买卖垮了台，对咱老百姓也没好处”
    【太岳消息】曲沃五区上月二十六日召开了各村干部会议以后，听城村干部认识到左倾瞎干不好，回村就召开群众会议，讨论纠偏。大家对补偿中农损失是弄通了，但对退还地主富农工商业财产，很不容易弄通。有人说：“地主富农人家有了买卖，还不又是享福吗？”丽文海的女人说：“这一下放的地主太宽了！”经过讨论，大家开始从远大处想起来。解旭盛说：“要光看眼前，就是不退好；要看远些，就是把买卖给了人家好。不这样，以后村里就没人敢闹工商业了。大地方的买卖人（指大城市）见咱解放军去了，也就把生意‘日塌’了。买卖都垮了台，想买个啥东西也没有，对咱老百姓有啥好处？”经过一番争吵，大多数人都赞成退还。村里过去斗争了两家手工业：一家醋坊，一家木铺。醋坊的东家被斗后逃跑了，还没回来，大家决定给他去信，叫他回来好好做生意。另一家木铺，木料完全没动，连同家具和房屋都一齐还给了原主。这样解决了以后，群众一般都认为做得对。贫农张定国说：“看起来，共产党真是有错就改，整天替老百姓打算盘哩！”
