(Taihang News) After holding a meeting and voicing truth and speaking honestly, the poor and lower-middle peasant masses of Houbu Village, Fourth District, Pingshun, returned items that had damaged the interests of middle peasants. At the meeting, the majority of poor and lower-middle peasant masses expressed strong dissatisfaction with harming the interests of middle peasants. Zhao Qilin said: "Talking about uniting with middle peasants, I think some people in our village just pay lip service! The middle peasants are in the same mutual aid group as us, and we see with our own eyes that they also work hard and sweat, but they don't get the wages they earned, saying they have to take care of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and they don't even appreciate it. For example, middle peasant Zhao Fusheng doesn't get wages in the group, how can he be motivated to produce?! Furthermore: New middle peasant Wang Aimin invested 500 yuan and received 600 yuan in dividends; old middle peasant Yue Hehua also invested 500 yuan, and the number of days invested was the same, but he only received 400 yuan. These things just don't make sense!" Zhao Kezheng said: "We talk about relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants all day long. I think our poor and lower-middle peasants are like a big wall. If it is upright and solid, others will dare to rely on it, otherwise, who would dare to rely on it? They would be afraid of it collapsing and crushing them!" Fa Zhi said: "The higher-ups call on us to produce well. I think if we continue to infringe on the interests of middle peasants, half of the land in our village will be barren this year. How can the poor and lower-middle peasants do it? Can they do all 1,700 mu of land in the village? If the interests of middle peasants are infringed upon, they will not dare to become prosperous, and they will not do a good job of farming, and the whole village will suffer, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will also suffer. As long as the interests of middle peasants are not infringed upon, everyone will not be afraid of producing and becoming prosperous, and they will be able to do a good job. Not to mention anything else, if each person plants one more pumpkin, our village has more than 200 laborers, just imagine how many more can be planted?" Everyone felt that what the three of them said was very right. After discussion, they all felt that harming middle peasants was harming themselves. Therefore, they all consciously sorted out the wages they owed and the things they obtained from the different treatment in the small-scale cooperatives, and returned them to the original owners. They also mobilized other poor and lower-middle peasants to return grain if they had it, and return labor if they didn't have grain, handling the matter fairly and justly, and uniting the whole village in production.

    　　　　Editor's opinion:
    The attitude and opinions expressed by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Houbu Village towards uniting with the middle peasants and compensating them for the losses from mistaken struggles provide us with an important enlightenment: that is, the poor and lower-middle peasants are fully capable of correctly understanding and accepting our Party's policies of uniting with the middle peasants, compensating for mistaken struggles, and correcting left-leaning deviations. Our Party's policies and slogans can become their policies and slogans, and they can consciously implement them. It is not as some comrades think: that compensating the middle peasants will dampen the enthusiasm of the poor peasants, encounter resistance from the poor peasants, or even alienate the poor peasants. On the contrary, we will therefore be able to better organize and mobilize the vast number of poor peasants, and will not fall into the small circle of a few activists. Because, in the eyes of most poor peasants, it is completely reasonable for the land and property of the middle peasants, earned with hard work and sweat, to be firmly guaranteed; and it is completely unreasonable to infringe upon them. This requires us to truly go deep into the middle and poor peasants, listen to their opinions, use the correct opinions among them (which usually represent the majority) to educate and overcome the incorrect opinions among them (which usually only account for a minority), and improve them, so that they can understand and accept the correct policies and ideas as guidelines for their actions. The Houbu Village material proves that this is entirely possible.

　　发扬贫雇农正确意见后补村退还中农财物
    【太行消息】平顺四区后补村贫雇群众开了个会，大家谈真理讲实话，退还了损害中农的东西。会上，大部贫雇农群众对损害中农利益，非常不满。赵起林说：“团结中农哩，我看咱村就有些是光嘴说哩！中农和咱在一个互助组里，咱亲眼看见人家也是一点汗一点血的在受，可是赚下工资不叫人家得，叫照顾贫雇，连个情也不领。象中农赵伏生在组里得不上工资，生产怎能起劲！？再说：新中农王爱民入股五百元，分红时分了六百元；旧中农岳荷花也入了五百元，入的天数一样，但只分了四百元。象这些事情实在说不通理呀！”赵克正说：“成天说依靠贫雇哩，我想咱这贫雇好比一堵大墙，要是端端正正结结实实的，别人才敢依靠，不然，谁敢依靠？还怕塌倒压住人家哩！”法芝说：“上级号召咱们要好好生产，我看要是还侵害中农利益，咱村今年地得荒一半。贫雇怎能干吧，还能把全村一千七百多亩土地做了？侵害中农，都不敢发家，做不好地，全村受害，贫雇也受害。只要不侵害中农利益，大家生产发家不怕了，就能干好。不说别的吧，一个人就多栽一棵南瓜，咱村二百多劳力，你瞧能多栽多少？”他三个人的话，大家都觉得很对。又经过讨论，都觉得伤害中农是自害自。于是都自觉的把自己所欠工资及由小型社不同待遇所得的东西，清理了一下，退还原主。并动员其他贫雇，有粮还粮，没粮还工，把事情办的公公道道的，全村团结生产。
    　　　　编者意见：
    后补村贫雇农对团结中农、补偿错斗中农损失所抱的态度，所发表的意见，给了我们一个重要启示：就是贫雇农民对我党团结中农，补偿错斗，纠正左倾偏向的方针，是完全能够正确领会与接受的。我党的政策、口号，是能够变成他们的政策、口号，而自觉地去执行的。并不象有些同志所想的：补偿中农，就会给贫农泼了冷水，遭到贫农抵抗，甚至脱离贫农。相反，我们将因此更能很好的组织与发动广大贫农，而不致陷入少数积极分子的小圈圈。因为，在大多数贫农看来，一点血、一点汗换来的中农的土地财物受到坚决保障，这是完全合乎情理的；侵害他们，则是完全不合情理的。这就要求我们工作时要真正深入到中贫农中去，倾听他们的意见，以他们中间正确的意见（这种意见通常是代表大多数），教育与克服他们中间不正确的意见（这种意见通常只占少数），提高他们，使他们领会与接受正确的政策思想，作为自己行动的指针。后补村材料证明，这是完全可能的。
