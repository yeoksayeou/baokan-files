    To Comrades of County Committee Offices and Correspondents of Work Groups in Various Localities:
    After the Central Bureau issued policy instructions to Taiyue and Taihang, and instructions regarding industrial and commercial policies, some localities have reported on the situation of checking work and correcting "leftist" deviations based on the spirit of the instructions, while others have not yet responded; or there are only inspection materials, and reports are insufficient regarding what effective measures have been taken to resolutely correct "leftism." Please report promptly, and report on your process and achievements in correcting "leftism."
    To Comrades of the Sixth Group of the Taihang Qing Committee: Your report on the inspection of industry and commerce in Wu'an Chengguan will be published. Please continue to report: How did the leadership correct it? What methods were used to remedy and support these damaged industries and businesses? Pay attention to the process and experience when reporting.
    To Comrades Zhang Daofeng and Wang Junbang of the Fourth District Committee of Hebei-Shandong-Henan: Please immediately organize correspondents to report on the recent situation in the Fourth Military Sub-district.
    To the She County Committee: What effective measures have you taken to implement the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting deviations and stop the still existing chaotic phenomena? Please quickly submit reports.

    各地县委办公室、各地工作组通讯员同志：
    中央局给太岳太行的政策指示及关于工商业政策的指示发下去以后，有的地方，已将根据指示精神检查工作纠正左倾偏向的情况作了报导，有的地方尚无反映；或只有检查材料，对采取什么有效办法坚决纠左，则报导得不够。请迅速反映，将你们纠左过程及成绩报导出来。
    太行清委会第六组同志：你们报导的对武安城关工商业检查稿子即刊用，请继续报导：领导上怎么样纠正的？用什么办法补救、扶植这些被破坏了的工商业？报导时应注意过程和经验。
    冀鲁豫四地委张道锋、王俊邦同志：请立即组织通讯员报导四分区近来情况。
    涉县县委会：你们采取什么有效措施贯彻中央局纠偏指示，停止仍然存在的混乱现象，请迅速来稿报导。
