【Taiyue News】During the Party rectification study, Tunliu cadres opposed the administrative order style, but now, conversely, tailism has occurred. When they returned to their work posts after studying, they felt they didn't understand the situation and relied on local cadres in everything; the local cadres, in turn, fearing to make mistakes because they hadn't participated in the study, relied on the cadres who had studied. This "three-way leaning caused the stove to collapse," and no one actively put forward their correct opinions to guide the work and educate the masses, resulting in tailism. For example, when evaluating preferential treatment for military dependents in Chuandiping Village, Third District, out of more than fifty military households in the village, after self-reporting and public discussion of the number of workdays for preferential treatment, the masses only evaluated three households as eligible, and even then, only a dozen workdays of preferential treatment were given to each household for the entire year, causing several military households to leave in tears. The district and village cadres dared not persuade the masses, fearing to commit "administrative orders." When cadres in Xinzhuang Village convened a meeting of the masses, people came and went as they pleased, and the cadres did not explain anything, so the meeting was not successfully held all day. The Luocun Village in the Fifth District was originally a model for mutual aid teams in the county, but the cadres said, "Now we are not allowed to use administrative orders, let the masses do as they please!" As a result, the mutual aid team became self-flowing, and the work of plowing on behalf of others could not be assigned. Such situations are not uncommon in various villages. In addition, some mutual aid teams that were clearly not formalistic were also "corrected" by the cadres. For example, Chang Hongsheng's mutual aid team in Laozhuanggou, Third District, was originally voluntarily organized, with sixty-two male laborers in the team, and their work was done very well, but the village cadres, fearing that it would be called "formalism," reported only forty-seven people to the higher authorities and divided the large team into many small groups in the village. As a result, the masses disagreed, saying, "A large group has more energy to move," so they reunited again. These deviations in leadership are being corrected.

　　对群众不教育不提高
  　屯留干部放弃领导
    【太岳消息】在整党学习中屯留干部反对了行政命令的作风，可是现在反过来又发生了尾巴主义。当他们学习后回到工作岗位的时候，觉着自己不了解情况，处处依靠当地干部；当地干部又因为自己没参加过学习怕犯错误，就又依靠学习过的干部，这样“三家相靠倒了锅灶”，谁也不积极提出自己正确主张去指导工作教育群众，当了尾巴主义。比如三区川地坪村评议优待军属时，全村五十多户军属，自报公议优待工数，结果群众才评议了三户可以优待，还是每户全年才给优待十几个工，弄得好几户军属都哭着走了。区村干部也不敢去说服群众，怕犯了“行政命令”。辛庄村干部召集群众开会时，群众来的来走的走，干部也不解释一下，就这样闹了一天也没开成个会。五区的罗村本来互助组是全县的模范，但是干部们说“现在不准行政命令啦，随群众做吧！”结果使互助组变成自流，代耕工作也派不动了。象这样的情形各村也还不少。另外有的互助组明明不是形式主义，干部也给“纠正”了，象三区老庄沟常宏胜的互助组，本来是自愿组织的，全组六十二个男劳动力，工作搞的很好，但是村干部怕说是“形式主义”，对上边只说是四十七人，并且在村里把大组又分成很多小组，结果群众不同意说：“大组烘火动弹有劲”，才又结合在一起了。这些偏向领导上正在想法纠正。
