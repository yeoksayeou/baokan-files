Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: Thanks to the great victory of the revolutionary war and the basic completion of land reform, the work of building a new democratic country on a national scale has begun in all aspects of the Northeast Liberated Area and will be greatly developed. In order to combine scientists and technical personnel with this great construction work, so as to make the best use of their talents and build the Northeast, the Northeast Administrative Committee has established the Northeast Academy of Sciences. The academy has departments of agriculture and forestry, engineering, medicine, and education, as well as a natural science research institute. The former enrolls students from secondary schools and above, while the latter absorbs graduates from domestic and foreign universities and colleges, or experts with equivalent specialized technology who have served in society for many years and have rich experience in creation, invention, and writing to conduct research. The academy began enrollment in Harbin, Jilin, Qiqihar, Siping and other places on the 10th of this month. Recently, a reporter visited a person in charge of the academy, who said: Due to the state-owned banks, railways, and mines, and the developed industry in the Northeast Liberated Area, the development of various construction works has unlimited prospects. There will be great developments in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, mining and metallurgy, iron and steel smelting, machinery industry, electricity, textile industry, food industry, clothing and leather industry, chemical industry, medical testing, etc., all of which require a large number of technical personnel; and as the People's Liberation Army recovers more industrial cities, this need becomes more urgent. The Northeast Academy of Sciences will understand the specialties of the admitted personnel to a considerable extent, and will send them to work posts at any time if the work requires it, so the study and research time is not fixed. If they are experts and scholars, they will be provided with convenience in research and work, and their difficulties will be solved to help them develop. The person in charge hoped that all scientists and technical personnel in the Northeast would participate in the Academy of Sciences and jointly build a new Northeast.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The education work in the Northeast Liberated Area has undergone significant changes in both quantity and quality in areas where land reform has been basically completed. A large number of emancipated peasants' children have enrolled in schools after the land reform. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province, 65 percent of school-age children in the province have already enrolled, and the number of primary school students has increased by two and a half times compared to 1946 before the land reform. According to incomplete statistics from various provinces and cities, there are currently 8,583 primary schools with 916,166 students. In some areas, the number of students has more than doubled that of the puppet Manchukuo era. Emancipated peasants in various places are actively establishing new private primary schools, and many landlords' children who are willing to serve the masses of peasants have also been hired as primary school teachers. Among middle school students, the number of students from worker and peasant backgrounds is also rapidly increasing. In Liaobei Province, students from worker and peasant backgrounds account for more than half of all middle school students. In order to meet the current practical needs, local cadre training classes are attached to various middle schools. In middle schools in Mudanjiang Province, rural clerk training classes are specifically set up, and most of the students are from worker and peasant backgrounds. After graduation, they will play a major role in the construction of the new socialist countryside in Northeast China. In the past two years, more than 15,000 young students from various middle schools have participated in the work of the front lines and rear agencies after preliminary ideological transformation. According to statistics from only seven provinces in northern Manchuria, Harbin City, and part of Liaoning Province, there are 119 schools above the secondary level (excluding schools belonging to the Northeast Political Committee), with 50,489 students, including 99 ordinary middle schools, 5 normal schools, 1 worker middle school, 3 agricultural colleges, 3 commercial colleges, 3 midwifery colleges, 2 engineering colleges (one of which is run by Korean expatriates), and 5 local administrative training classes. In addition, there are Liaoning Public School (in Shanchengzhen), Zhengjiatun Youth Training Class, Jilin University, and the Sipingjie Agricultural College, which is being established by the Liaobei Provincial Government, specifically for accepting college and middle school students who have fled from enemy areas. In addition, there are more than ten schools such as Northeast University, China Medical University, Military and Political University, and specialized cadre schools, railway schools, and art schools established by various regions and departments, with more than 10,000 students. The recently established Northeast Academy of Sciences specializes in recruiting scientific and technical personnel to meet the needs of the vast construction departments in the Northeast.

　　吸收科学技术人材建设新东北
  　东北解放区设立科学院
  　各地中小学极发达农民子弟占半数
    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北解放区由于革命战争的伟大胜利，及土地改革的基本完成，具有国家规模的新民主主义建设工作已经在各方面开始，并将大大发展。东北行政委员会为使科学家、技术人材与此伟大建设工作相结合，达到人尽其材建设东北的目的，特设立东北科学院。该院设有农林、理工、医学、教育等系及自然科学研究所。前者招收中等以上学校学生学习，后者吸收国内外大学专科毕业，或有同等专门技术、在社会服务多年具有丰富经验及创造、发明、著作之专家进行研究。该院于本月十日起分别在哈市、吉林、齐齐哈尔、四平等地开始招考。日前记者曾走访该院某负责人，据称：东北解放区由于银行、铁路、矿山国有及工业发达的条件，各项建设工作的发展具有无限前途，无论在农业、牧畜业、林业、采矿冶金业、炼铁炼钢业、机器工业、电业、纺织业、食品工业、被服皮革工业、化学工业、医疗化验等各方面都将有极大发展，都需要大批技术人材；而且随着解放军收复工业城市越多，此项需要就越迫切。东北科学院将在考取人员中相当了解其专长，以后如果工作需要，将随时派往工作岗位，所以学习研究时间并非固定不变。如果是专家、学者，则在研究和工作上予以方便，并解决其困难，帮助其发展。该负责人希望所有东北科学家、技术人材都来参加科学院，共同建设新的东北。
    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北解放区的教育工作在土地改革基本完成的区域，不论数量或质量上均起了重大变化，广大的翻身农民子弟在土改后纷纷入学。据合江省统计，全省学龄儿童百分之六十五已经入学，小学生数目较土改前一九四六年增加两倍半。据各省市不完全统计，现有小学八千五百八十三处，学生九十一万六千一百六十六名。某些地区的学生数目已超过伪满时代的一倍半，各地翻身农民并积极建立新的民办小学，许多愿意为农民大众服务的地主子弟，亦被聘为小学教师。中学生中，工农出身学生亦迅速增加。辽北省所有中学生中，工农出身学生占半数以上。为适应当前的实际需要，各中学内附设地方干部训练班。牡丹江省中学内，并专门设立乡村文书训练班，学生多半为工农出身。他们毕业后，对东北新农村的建设将起重大作用。过去两年来，各中学有一万五千以上的青年学生在思想初步改造之后，参加了前线及后方各机关的工作，现仅据北满七省、哈尔滨市及辽宁省的一部分材料统计，中等以上学校即达一百十九处（属于东北政委会的学校不在内），学生达五万零四百八十九名，其中普通中学九十九处，师范五处，工人中学一处，农科专校、商科专校、助产专校各三处，工科专校两处（其中一处为朝鲜侨民所办），地方行政训练班五处；而专门收容自敌区逃来大、中学生的则有辽宁公学（在山城镇），和郑家屯青训班、吉林大学及辽北省府正在创办的四平街文农学院。另外，如东北大学、中国医科大学、军政大学及各地区、各部门设立之专门干部学校、铁路学校、艺术学校等亦有十余处，学生达万名以上。最近成立之东北科学院，专门招收科学、技术人才以应东北广大建设部门之需。
