Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Youth Army:
    Soldiers Cannot Eat Their Fill

[This report] According to news reports, before the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Youth Army was annihilated, it extorted the people of Luoyang in various ways. Its officers were corrupt, causing the soldiers to be unable to eat their fill. When the Youth Army collected military grain, they hung a 150-斤 (jin, a unit of weight, about 1.1 lbs) weight on a 100-斤 scale, causing the common people to always lose 40 to 50 斤. However, even under these circumstances, they could not give even one grain less, forcing the common people to be unable to even eat sweet potatoes and corn. The masses' grain was completely plundered. The common people had to buy grain from the Youth Army to hand over, and this grain all went into the pockets of the division and regimental commanders. As a result, it was the Youth Army soldiers who went hungry, and the common people who suffered. The Youth Army could take things from shops in Luoyang city at will—socks, shirts, anything, even the reflector cloth in the photo studio was taken. (Xiao Fang)

    蒋匪青年军
    士兵不得一饱
    【本报消息】蒋匪青年军未被歼灭前，以各种方法勒索洛阳人民，其军官贪污腐化，使得士兵都不得一饱。青年军征收军粮时，把一百五十斤的秤锤，挂在一百斤的秤杆上，致使老百姓总是要吃亏四五十。但是在这种情况下，也不能少给一颗，逼得老百姓连红薯玉茭都吃不上，群众的粮食被搜刮一空，老百姓只有向青年军买粮交，这些粮食都装到师长、团长腰包里去了，结果饿的是青年军士兵，苦的是老百姓。青年军可以在洛阳市上随意拿店铺的东西，袜子、衬衣，什么都要，连照相馆里的反光布也被拿去。        （萧芳）
