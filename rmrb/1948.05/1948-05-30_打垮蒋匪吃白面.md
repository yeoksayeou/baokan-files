　　Defeat the Chiang Bandits and Eat White Flour
    Ji Lu Yu Branch Agency
    The village of ×, on the banks of the Wen River, is only twenty-odd li away from the Chiang bandit-occupied city of Wenshang. It frequently suffers from the exploitation and looting by Chiang bandit secret agents, resulting in an unprecedented disaster this spring. Thanks to the relief provided by our democratic government, wasteland was eliminated, and no one starved to death. Now the wheat is turning yellow, and the masses are happily saying, "We've made it through spring, and we can't bear to starve anymore!" Some people also say, "We can't say for sure if we'll get to eat this year's wheat. Last year's wheat was all snatched away by the enemy. If they snatch these two mu of wheat again this year, we won't escape starvation." Everyone is worried about whether they can eat this year's wheat. They all believe that without taking action soon, it won't be reliable.
    On the evening of May 17th, a village meeting was held in a courtyard. The militia captain said, "Let's quickly harvest the wheat. The enemy in Wenshang is active in seizing wheat, and these days the enemy often comes out to loot. It's not a solution for us to just hide. The district meeting said that each of our villages should start keeping watch at night. The enemy in Wenshang doesn't dare to come out easily during the day; if they do, our large contingent will beat them. If we keep watch, and they come out to rob at night, we'll fight them. The wheat is ripe, and this year we must harvest it quickly, thresh it quickly, and hide it quickly, so they can't rob it." As soon as he finished speaking, the whole courtyard burst into noise. Some young and strong people said, "Sharpen the spearheads, and if they come, we'll fight them." Most people said, "We should have been guarding our homes long ago! It's terrible to be captured by them." A few people also said, "Keeping watch is one thing, but they have fast guns and Mauser pistols. We don't even have a small hand grenade. If they come, are we going to fight them with our bare fists? Let's see what's happening in the villages outside. If the villages outside are all watching, we'll watch too; if the villages outside are not watching, it won't work just for our village to watch." A few others said, "Keeping watch is not just a matter of words. If we hold out, that's great, but if we can't, it will be a big disaster." The opinions of these few were opposed by the majority. Some said, "Are we just going to stick our necks out and wait to be captured without even fighting back? They don't have two lives. If we watch our homes, they'll have to think twice about coming to rob us." The village chief said, "If our village doesn't hold out, and the other villages don't hold out either, every family will suffer. If our village can fight, the other villages will certainly fight too." In the debate, everyone clearly realized that fighting is the only good solution. Everyone also said that if we want to fight, what do we do without weapons? Some said, "The few villages to the west of ×× are still holding out so strongly with spears (red spears) and homemade cannons! It's not like our village doesn't have these things."
    The next day, the masses in this village began keeping watch. In the last six or seven days, with the cooperation of our local armed forces, they have driven away the Chiang bandits who came out of Wenshang city to loot twice.

　　打垮蒋匪吃白面
    冀鲁豫分社
    汶河岸旁的×庄，是离汶上城蒋匪仅二十余里的一个村子。经常遭受蒋匪特务的压榨抢掠，造成了今春空前的灾难。经我民主政府救济，才消灭了荒地，没饿死人。现在麦子已经发黄，群众高兴着说：“一春天可熬过来啦，可再挨不了饿啦！”也有些人说：“今年的麦子咱不敢说能不能捞着吃。去年的麦子都被敌人抢去啦，今年要再把这二亩麦给抢走就脱不了挨饿。”大家都耽心今年的麦子能不能吃到嘴里。都认为不早生办法，还是吃不牢靠。
    五月十七日晚上，在一个院子里开村民大会。自卫队长说：“快割麦穗拉，汶上的敌人正活动抢麦子，这几天敌人也时常出来抢东西。咱光躲躲藏藏的不是办法，怎么办呢？区里开会说，咱各庄上都应当打起更来看家。汶上的敌人白天轻易不敢出来，出来就有咱的大队揍他。咱打起更来，到夜里他再出来抢，咱就给他干。麦子熟了，今年咱要快割、快打、快藏，叫他抢不着。”刚一讲完，整个院里就嚷嚷起来。有些青壮年说：“把枪头子磨的快快的，来了就打他。”大部分人都说：“早就该看家啦！叫他抓去真不得了。”也有少数人说：“看家是该看，可是人家有快枪，有盒子枪，咱连个小手榴弹也没有，来了咱用空拳头打人家？咱看看外边庄上吧，外边庄上要都看，咱也看；外边庄上要都不看，光咱庄上也不办事。”还有个别的说：“看家可不是一句话，撑住了怪好，撑不住就是个大祸。”这少数人的意见被多数所反对。有的说：“咱挺着脖子等挨抓，连手也不还吗？他也没两个命，咱看起家来，他来抢时也得费费心思。”村长说：“咱庄不撑，外庄也不撑，谁家也都要受害。咱庄要能干起来，外庄上也一定会干起来。”大家在争论中，明确认识了只有干才是好办法。大家又说，要干没有武器怎么办？有的说：“西边××几个庄，人家用杆子（红枪）土炮还撑的那么红哩！咱庄上也不是没有这些家伙。”
    第二天，这个村的群众就看起家。最近六七天内，在我地方武装的配合下，就把汶上城出来抢掠的蒋匪打跑了两次。
