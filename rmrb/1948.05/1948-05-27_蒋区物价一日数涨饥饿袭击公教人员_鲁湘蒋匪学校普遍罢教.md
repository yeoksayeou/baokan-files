Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Public employees in the Chiang-controlled areas are increasingly trapped in starvation. At the end of last month, the Chiang bandit authorities announced the cost of living index for public employees for April, stipulating that the index for areas such as Nanjing and Shanghai was 240,000 times the base, while the wholesale price index in Shanghai had already risen to over 520,000 times. Those with a base salary of 50 yuan had a total income of 7.68 million yuan; however, their actual income was only equivalent to 29.5% of the pre-war level, or about 14.7 yuan, and monthly salaries were often delayed by a month, so the actual value was even lower. In the middle of last month, a Tianjin newspaper published a letter signed by "a group of miserable petty public employees," which criticized the Chiang bandit authorities for the so-called "monthly salary adjustments based on the cost of living index," calling it "blowing a trumpet behind a closed door." The letter pointed out: "Which bureaucrat (except for high-ranking officials) isn't frowning? Even if the adjustments are made monthly and paid on time, they are only based on the previous month's index, still unable to keep up with the current month's prices." At the beginning of last month, a teacher in Shenyang also painfully complained: "Everyone knows that prices change several times a day. What can we buy with our salary a month later?" All faculty and staff of the Chiang bandit Tianjin County Simple Normal School also protested against the Chiang bandit authorities' "delaying the implementation of treatment adjustments until a month later each time." In Kaifeng at the beginning of last month, the salary received by a mid-level civil servant could only cover the monthly rent for two rooms. As for the so-called "rationed goods," they were even more "nominal." At the end of last month, a letter from "a group of small civil servants" published in a Tianjin newspaper acutely revealed: "For three months, we haven't seen an ounce of flour," angrily shouting, "The meager salary we receive every month can't support our wives and children!" In the middle of last month, 17,000 employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang also petitioned the Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters due to financial difficulties, protesting the bureau's disregard for them. Tragedies caused by excessively low salaries for public employees have also become commonplace. In the middle of last month, Song Qingshao, a staff member of the Materials Section of the Chiang bandit Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau's Public Bus Management Office, suffered from osteomyelitis. Before undergoing surgery in the hospital, he needed several hundred CCs (cubic centimeters) of blood transfusions. Because he had no money to buy blood, when hospital staff went to the Management Office to draw blood from his colleagues, they saw that every face lacked nutrition and looked pale, and they couldn't bear to do it. As a result, Song is now hemiplegic and his condition has worsened.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to comprehensive reports from Tianjin newspapers: Large-scale anti-hunger strikes broke out in Shandong and Hunan provinces' Chiang bandit (provincial) schools last month. Faculty and staff of Jining Middle School, Ziyang Normal School, Qufu Normal School, and Tengxian Middle School in Shandong Province went on strike on April 15th to protest the Chiang bandit authorities' failure to issue living allowances for April according to the new standards, and to fight for the reasonable demand of distributing two bags of flour from February and issuing living allowances at the beginning of the month. Xiangxiang Senior Industrial School, Xiangtan Women's Middle School, Chaling Second Middle School, Lingling Seventh Middle School, Nanyue Twelfth Middle School, and Fourth Normal School in Hunan Province went on a general strike at the beginning of April to fight for equal treatment with Changsha and Hengyang areas and to protest the Chiang bandit authorities' deduction of teachers' salaries in various places, paying them at 70% of the full amount. Primary school teachers and staff in Hunan Province were also involved in the anti-hunger struggle. They sent representatives to the Kuomintang Education Department and Finance Department in Changsha on April 3rd to petition.

　　蒋区物价一日数涨饥饿袭击公教人员
  　鲁湘蒋匪学校普遍罢教
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋区公教人员日益陷于饥饿绝境。上月底，蒋匪当局公布四月份公教人员生活指数，其中规定京沪等地区指数为二十四万倍，而该月中沪市批发物价总指数则已涨至五十二万余倍。底薪五十元者，其收入共为七百六十八万元；但实际收入仅抵战前百分之二十九点五，即约十四元七角而已，且每月薪津往往有相隔一月尚未领到者，故其实值更将大为降低。上月中，天津报纸披露具名“一群苦命的小公教人员”的信，即指责蒋匪当局曾喧嚷一时之所谓“按月照生活指数发薪”，为“隔着门吹喇叭”。该信指出：“局内人（大官员除外）哪一位不是愁眉苦脸，即或按月调整准时发下，亦只有按照上月的指数为标准，仍旧追不上本月份的物价。”上月初，沈阳一位教师亦沉痛控诉：“大家都知道过去的物价是一天数变，一个月后再得到我们的薪金还能买一点什么东西呢？”蒋匪天津县立简易师范学校全体教职员，亦抗议蒋匪当局对“调整待遇，每次均拖延至一个月后始实行。”开封上月初，一个中级公务员领到的薪金，只能支付两间房子的月租。至于所谓“配给实物”，更是“名存实亡”。上月底津报载“一群小公务员”的信上即痛切揭露：“三个月来，我们一两面（指‘配面’）也没有看见”，愤而发出“每月拿的那微薄的待遇，养不活我们的老婆孩子”的绝叫。上月中，沈阳中长路员工一万七千名，因生活困难，亦向蒋匪东北行辕请愿，并抗议该局置彼等于不顾。公教人员因待遇过低而发生之悲剧，亦已屡见不鲜。上月中，蒋匪天津公用局公共汽车管理处材料科职员宋庆绍，因患骨髓瘤，住医院施行手术前必需输血几百ＣＣ（立方公分），因无钱买血，医院人员到管理处抽取该处同人血液时，看见每张缺乏营养的面孔，都现出菜色不忍下手，致宋现已半身不遂，危险加重。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合平津报纸消息：山东、湖南两省蒋匪（省立）学校，上月爆发大规模反饥饿罢教。鲁省济宁中学、滋阳师范、曲阜师范、滕县中学四校教职员，为抗议蒋匪不照新标准发给四月份生活补助费，及争取自二月份起配售两袋面粉，月初拨发生活补助费等合理要求，于四月十五日全体罢教。湘省湘乡高级工业学校、湘潭女中、茶陵二中、零陵七中、南岳十二中及第四师范等校，为争取与长沙、衡阳两区平等待遇，及抗议蒋匪克扣各地教员薪金按七折发给，于四月初实行总罢教。湘省（省立）小校教职员亦卷入反饥饿斗争中，他们于四月三日派遣代表多人赴长沙国民党教育厅及财政厅请愿。
