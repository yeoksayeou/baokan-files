    [Taihang News] As the wheat harvest approaches, the enemies in the Taihang border areas are actively preparing to seize wheat. To strengthen and prepare for the struggle surrounding the wheat harvest in the border areas, the Taihang District Party Committee issued an important directive to local party committees on the 5th of this month. It stated: Recently, Jiang bandits in northern Henan held a meeting in Kaifeng specifically to discuss the issue of seizing wheat. They are now mobilizing at all levels and inciting the masses in the Jiang-controlled areas to fully prepare and organize for seizing wheat. The Yan bandits have established a long defensive line in the border mountain areas in our western line, preparing to encompass the wheat harvest on the plains. This year's wheat harvest struggle will be more acute and fierce than in any previous year. Due to certain errors in our policies and guidelines in the border area struggle since last year, we have not focused everything on the struggle against the enemy, neglecting the development and consolidation of the united front against Jiang and Yan. We have indiscriminately attacked landlords and rich peasants, even harming middle peasants, which has expanded the enemy's camp, isolated ourselves, and made enemy bandits and reactionary groups very active. In addition, cadres have retreated, relaxing mass work, causing the troops to fail to obtain the assistance of the masses, and the entire struggle has fallen into a passive state. The key to changing this passive situation lies in mobilizing and organizing the masses to struggle against the enemy and launching mass guerrilla warfare. The key to mobilizing and organizing the masses lies in rectifying our various policies, eliminating the influence of certain erroneous policies of the past, uniting all anti-Jiang and Yan forces, consolidating and developing the anti-Jiang and Yan united front, and isolating the enemy. This work must be based on armed forces and combined with constant political offensives, otherwise it will inevitably fall through. In specific methods, first, we must strengthen work in the guerrilla areas, deeply propagate the Party's policies in the guerrilla areas, effectively compensate middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, resettle landlords and rich peasants who were struggled against, and differentiate between rich peasants and landlords, and also differentiate between small and medium landlords and local bullies, and large landlords. For those who were wrongly killed in the past, their families should be given appropriate consolation and care. Areas where land reform has not been carried out should be stopped. Doing so will not only stabilize the various strata of the masses in the guerrilla areas but also have a great impact on the various strata in the Jiang and Yan areas. At the same time, it is also necessary to repeatedly expose the enemy's conspiracies among the broad masses, make the masses recognize the enemy's ugly face, and increase the masses' hatred of the enemy in order to stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for the struggle against the enemy, and then organize the masses to establish, restore, or strengthen border guerrilla groups, militia joint defense, guerrilla garrison zones, and other war organizations to carry out mass guerrilla warfare. Second, we must also mobilize the masses in the Jiang and Yan areas to struggle against the enemy, mobilize the masses to protect grain, protect manpower, defend the wheat harvest, and oppose the enemy's looting. It is necessary to frequently send troops or plainclothes armed forces to actively operate deep in the Jiang and Yan areas, conduct political offensives, expose the enemy's conspiracies, publicize our policies, and mobilize and cover up the masses' struggle. We must carry forward the good traditions of the armed work teams during the Anti-Japanese War and not allow the enemy's rule to stabilize. At the same time, we must use the relations of the masses in the guerrilla areas to carry out work among the masses in the Jiang and Yan areas, and seek the unity of the masses in the enemy and our areas against the enemy. Only by making the struggle position in the guerrilla area more consolidated can the victory of the wheat harvest struggle be guaranteed. Furthermore, in order to change the situation of the struggle and in order to carry out the wheat harvest struggle, it is necessary to conscientiously carry out enemy military work, disintegrate the enemy, and relax the enemy. When enemy, die-hard, and reactionary bandits are captured, they must be educated and released separately. It is necessary to use mass relations to carry out mass disintegration work. This work should be taken as the main content in the entire political offensive. If the above basic aspects are done well, we will definitely be able to achieve the victory of the wheat harvest struggle. In addition, it is necessary to educate the masses in the Jiang-controlled areas who are coerced by the enemy to our area to seize grain, and make them understand that the enemy is squeezing them, causing poverty, and using their poverty to sell their lives for the enemy. Smash the enemy's conspiracy to create red-white opposition, disintegrate the deceived reactionary masses, and isolate their key elements. Finally, the party, government, army and people must fully coordinate and go all out; strengthen the command at all levels, concentrate the use of power under the unified leadership of the party. When deploying various forces, we must prepare for a resolute and sustained struggle for a considerable period of time, and do not think that the struggle will end after the wheat harvest. After the wheat harvest, it is often the most acute and tense period of struggle, and we must guarantee the victory of grain protection to stimulate the masses to carry out the struggle against the enemy.

    蒋阎匪积极布置抢粮
    太行区党委号召保麦
    克服左倾，扩大反蒋阎统一战线
    【太行消息】麦收迫近，太行边地敌人都在积极准备抢麦。太行区党委为加强与准备边地麦收斗争，特于本月五日向各地委发出重要指示。略谓：最近豫北蒋匪在开封集会，专门讨论抢麦问题，现正逐级动员，并向蒋管区群众煽动，以全力准备与组织抢麦。阎匪在我西线边山一带建立绵长的防线，准备囊括平川麦收。今年的麦收斗争将比以往任何一年都更尖锐剧烈。由于去年以来我们边地斗争中方针与政策上的某些错误，不是一切为了对敌斗争，忽视反蒋阎统一战线的发展与巩固，不加分别的普遍打击了地主与富农，甚至伤害了中农，以致扩大了敌人阵营，孤立了自己，敌匪及会斗很活跃，加以干部退缩，放松群众工作，致使部队不能取得群众协助，整个斗争陷于被动。改变这一被动形势的关键，在于发动与组织群众的对敌斗争，开展群众游击战争。而发动与组织群众的关键，即在于端正我们的各种政策，肃清过去某些错误政策的影响，团结一切反蒋阎力量，巩固与发展反蒋阎统一战线，孤立敌人。这些工作，又必须以武装为骨干，结合经常的政治攻势来进行，否则就必然落空。在具体作法上，首先须加强游击区工作，在游击区深入宣传党的政策，切实补偿错斗中农，安置被斗地主富农，对富农要和地主分别开来，中小地主与恶霸，大地主也要分别对待，过去错杀了的人，应对其家属作适当抚衅照顾。过去未进行土改的地区，一律停止进行。这样做不但可以安定游击区的各阶层群众，且对蒋阎区各阶层会有很大影响。同时，亦必须在广大群众中反复揭露敌人的阴谋，使群众认识敌人的狰狞面目，提高群众对敌人的仇恨心，以激发群众对敌斗争的积极性，进而组织群众建立、恢复或强化边地游击集团、民兵联防、游击警备地带等战争机构，开展群众性游击战争。其次，必须在蒋阎区也发动群众对敌斗争，发动群众护粮、护丁、保卫麦收，反对敌人抢掠。必须经常派遣部队或便衣武装，不断深入蒋阎区积极活动，进行政治攻势，揭露敌人的阴谋，宣传我们的政策，发动与掩护群众的斗争。要发扬抗日时期武工队的好传统，不让敌人的统治稳定起来。同时要运用游击区群众的关系，向蒋阎区群众进行工作，求得敌我区域的群众团结对敌。使游击区的斗争阵地更加巩固，麦收斗争的胜利才有保证。再，为了转变斗争形势，为了开展麦收斗争，必须认真进行敌军工作，瓦解敌人，松懈敌人。俘到敌、顽、会匪时，必须进行教育，分别释放。要利用群众关系，进行群众性的瓦解工作。在整个政治攻势中，要把这一工作作为主要内容。上述这几个基本方面如果作的好，我们就一定可取得麦收斗争的胜利。此外，要教育被敌胁迫到我区抢粮的蒋管区群众，使了解敌人压榨他们，造成穷困，又利用他们穷困，替敌卖命。粉碎敌制造赤白对立之阴谋，瓦解被骗的会斗群众，孤立其首要分子。最后，党政军民必须完全协调一致，全力以赴；要强化各级指挥部，在党统一领导下，集中使用力量。在布署各种力量时，要准备在一个相当时期内进行坚决的持续的斗争，不要以为麦收后斗争即会终结。收麦后，往往正是斗争最尖锐紧张的时期，我们必须保证护粮的胜利以激发群众对敌斗争的贯彻。
