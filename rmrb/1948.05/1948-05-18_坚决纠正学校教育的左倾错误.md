　　Resolutely Correct Leftist Errors in School Education

　　Last autumn, in some areas of our region, under the pretext of the "poor peasant and hired laborer line" and "establishing poor peasant and hired laborer backbone," the class division and class struggle of the countryside were brought into the schools in an extremely erroneous manner, calling it "squeezing out feudalism." Organizations such as the so-called "Poor Peasant Associations," "Poor Peasant Groups," and "Poor Peasant Corps" were successively established in Peking University's College of Agriculture and many middle and primary schools. In some places, these organizations actually led struggles. Many people who came from landlord and rich peasant families and had been engaged in education for many years were struggled against. In a certain middle school in the Taiyue area, the phenomenon of poor peasant and hired laborer students having landlord and rich peasant students serve them meals occurred, and even more serious was that the children of struggle targets were treated as "little bullies" and "little landlords" to be struggled against, labelled and controlled, deprived of all democratic rights, and even had their stationery confiscated and distributed to poor peasant and hired laborer students, implementing so-called equal distribution.

　　These serious errors completely violated the New Democratic education policy stipulated by Chairman Mao as "proletarian-led, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal for the broad masses of the people," abandoned the leadership of the proletariat, and the task of the school was not to cultivate the people's sound New Democratic ideology, improve culture, eliminate illiteracy, and eliminate various cultural and political backward phenomena, but instead to mobilize poor peasants and hired laborers to create struggles. It attacked some teachers and students and seriously damaged the New Democratic education cause.

　　Now, these errors have been corrected in some places. However, there are still many places where not enough attention has been paid, and from the self-criticisms reported in this newspaper today, they still appear to be insufficiently profound, and the errors have not been excavated from the perspective of the education work's policy line. We hope that in all areas where such errors have occurred, local governments and schools will resolutely correct them, conscientiously correct the teacher compositions that were wrongly determined last year due to "tracing three generations," "cutting off tails," and "dian dou lu," pay attention to solving their living difficulties, and the children of households who have been struggled against must be allowed to enroll in school (including the children of landlords and rich peasants). The school life in each village must return to normal. At present, many teachers are not provided with salaries, firewood, or rice, and the government must quickly find a way to solve this. When necessary, teacher conferences can be convened to solicit their opinions and correct biases. As long as the leadership is determined, it will not be difficult to eliminate all these errors in a short period of time.

### 坚决纠正学校教育的左倾错误

　　坚决纠正学校教育的左倾错误
    去年秋季，我区有些地方借口“贫雇路线”、“树立贫雇骨干”，极其错误的把农村的阶级划分、阶级斗争搬到学校里边来，称之为“挤封建”。象北大农学院及不少的中学小学均曾先后成立了所谓的“贫农会”、“贫农小组”、“贫农团”。这些组织在有些地方居然领导起斗争。许多出身地主富农而从事教育工作多年的人被斗了。太岳某中学则发生有贫雇学生会餐让地主富农出身学生端饭的现象，更为严重者：是把斗争对象的子弟当做“小恶霸”、“小地主”来斗，挂牌管制，剥夺一切民主权利，甚至没收他们的文具分给贫雇学生，实行所谓平分。
    这些严重错误，完全违背了毛主席所规定的“无产阶级领导的，人民大众的反帝反封建的”新民主主义教育方针，放弃了无产阶级的领导，学校的任务不是培养人民的健全的新民主主义思想，提高文化，消灭文盲，肃清各种文化政治落后现象，反而是发动贫雇制造斗争。打击了一部分教员学生，严重的损害了新民主主义教育事业。
    现在，这些错误有些地方是纠正了。但还有不少地方没有引起足够重视，从今天本报所报导的这些检讨看，也还显得不够深刻，没有从教育工作的方针路线去发掘错误。我们希望凡是发生这类错误地区，各地政府学校要坚决纠正，要认真改正去年因“追三代”“割尾巴”“掂都卢”而错订的教员成份，注意解决他们的生活困难，被斗户的子弟要一律允许入学（地主富农子弟在内）。各村的学校生活要恢复正常状态，目前很多教员无人供给薪金柴米，政府必须迅速设法解决。必要时可以召开教员会议，征求他们意见，纠正偏向。只要领导上有决心，这一切错误在很短期间不难肃清。
