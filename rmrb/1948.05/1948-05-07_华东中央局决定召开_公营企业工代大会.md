　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th. The East China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to convene a Public Enterprise Workers' Representative Congress on May 30th, to establish a Public Enterprise Trade Union Federation, to lead the workers' movement in public enterprises, and to determine and stipulate that each enterprise's trade union should be the broadest mass organization in that enterprise, with all original mass organizations serving as a department of the trade union or under its leadership (such as clubs, food committees, etc.). The trade union represents the daily economic, political, and cultural interests of the workers, and at the same time, must lead the workers to fight for the long-term interests of the proletariat. A preparatory committee for the representative congress has now been formed by Sun Yefang and twelve others to begin preparatory work.
