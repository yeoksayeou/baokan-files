　　Not Taking Disaster Relief Seriously and Falsifying Reports
  　Village Chief of Wuqingnao Punished

    [Shouyang News] After more than 3,000 catties of relief grain was distributed in Wuqingnao Village, Shouyang County, the Joint Defense Production Guidance Group convened a meeting of village cadres from Niuhuangkou, Wuqingnao, and Bishi villages to conduct inspections in order to promptly understand the distribution situation in each village. At that time, Yan Yiwen, the village chief of Wuqingnao, reported very well at the meeting: "After discussions by the poor and hired peasants, and public deliberation by the masses, the grain was distributed to sixteen poor and hired peasant households who were currently hungry, and seven middle peasant households, a total of seventy-eight people, and distributed in three grades: the first grade, three households, four people, those with greater difficulties received 55 catties each; the second grade, eight households, thirty-two people (those who could survive for five or six days), received 34 catties each; the third grade, eleven households, forty-two people (those who could survive for ten days), received 28 catties each. Now the whole village can survive the spring famine." At that time, the leadership, fearing it was not true, personally went to investigate. After inspection, out of 119 households with 454 people in the whole village, only eight households (36 people) did not receive grain, and the rest were distributed evenly. This was completely inconsistent with the village chief's original report, so a meeting of all village cadres was convened for self-criticism: (1) The distribution scope was too wide. More than one-third of the households could have survived until the wheat harvest with their own production, but this time each person received seven or eight catties of grain, which neither solved major problems nor reduced their waste. (2) No distinction was made between diligence and laziness, households with few people and many people, households with draft animals and those without draft animals, and it was not combined with the masses' self-salvation through production. After the grain was distributed, the masses were not organized to actively produce, which fostered a reliance mentality among some of the masses. The lazy man Wu Shenghuan ate tofu and was still wasting it. Deputy Village Chief Kang Huibin said: "This time, my thinking on the distribution of relief grain was very unclear. I did not take good responsibility and was only afraid, seeking quick release. I did not conduct a good investigation beforehand, and it was not discussed by the poor and hired peasants or deliberated by the masses. It was simply based on self-reporting by the masses, forming a situation where every request was granted." The Director of the Armed Forces Committee said: "This time, the cadres did not discuss the distribution of grain well, and the real problems of the poor and hired peasant households were not solved." After inspection, it was believed that Village Chief Yan Yiwen was not realistic and made false reports to his superiors, and he received a public warning at the cadre meeting. (Fan Shengqing)

　　不认真救灾作假报告
  　五顷垴村长受处分
    【寿阳消息】本县五顷垴村第二次救济粮食三千余斤发放后，联防生产指导组为及时了解各村发放情况，召开了牛黄口、五顷垴、碧石三个村村干部会议，进行检查。当时五顷垴村长阎益文在会上报告得很漂亮：“经过贫雇讨论，群众公议，将粮发给当下饿肚的贫雇农十六户，中农七户，共七十八人，分三等发给：一等三户，四人，困难较大者每人五十五斤；二等八户，卅二人（能过活五、六天者），每人卅四斤；三等十一户，四十二人（能过活十来天者），每人二十八斤，现全村都能渡过春荒了。”当时领导上惟恐不实，亲去调查。经过检查，全村一一九户，四五四人，只有八户（卅六人）未分粮，其余都平均分了。和村长原来报告完全不符，便召集全村干部会议，进行检讨：（一）发放面太宽，有三分之一以上的户数，本来加上自己生产，足能维持到麦收，这次每人也得了七、八斤粮，既顶不了大事，又增加他们的浪费。（二）勤和懒、人少和人多、有劳畜力和无劳畜力户没有分别照顾，和群众生产自救没有结合，发粮后没有组织群众积极生产，助长了部分群众依靠心理，懒汉吴生换吃豆腐，仍在浪费。副村长康会斌说：“这次发救济粮，我思想上就很不明确，没很好好负责，光是怕，急求快放，事先没有进行很好调查，又未经贫雇讨论、群众公议，只简单根据群众自报，形成有求必应。”武委会主任说：“这次发粮，干部就没有很好讨论，真正贫雇困难户没解决了问题。”检查后认为村长阎益文不实事求是，向上假报告，在干部会上受到当众警告处分。（范生庆）
