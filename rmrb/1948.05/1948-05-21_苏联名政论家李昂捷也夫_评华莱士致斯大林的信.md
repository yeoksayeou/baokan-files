　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Pravda published on the 16th a commentary by the famous political commentator Leontiev on Wallace's open letter to Stalin. The full text is as follows:

　　"The Soviet people read with great interest the recently published open letter from Wallace to Stalin. This is not only because the author of the letter leads the American progressive forces in their struggle against the reactionaries; nor is it only because the content of the letter concisely mentions various outstanding issues in the current international situation; the main reason is the attitude taken in raising the questions. There is much talk and writing around the world about Soviet-American relations. The famous statements exchanged on this issue on May 4th and 9th gave new impetus to this discussion. In contrast to the countless foreign newspaper and politician commentaries, Wallace's remarks stand out particularly well in two aspects: first, its realism; second, its consistency between words and deeds. These two characteristics are all the more prominent because they are lacking in many statements by American official spokesmen."

　　"Wallace is a realist: he deeply understands the necessity of compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union on current differences. For example, he recognizes that the short-sighted hope of trying to force the Soviet Union to accept the views of the American ruling class on disputed issues through blackmail, intimidation, or the notorious 'war of nerves' is completely unfounded."

　　"As everyone knows, the so-called hard-line policy in American diplomacy or the 'Cold War' strategy in foreign newspapers aims precisely at forcing the Soviet Union to submit. Practical experience has proved that this strategy, regardless of its many other shortcomings, is primarily unrealistic, because it has not, and essentially cannot, produce any positive results. Wallace knows this and suggests another method, namely, the method of resolving disputes through negotiation, which should reach agreements on a mutually acceptable basis."

　　"Wallace is consistent between words and deeds: after recognizing that there is no conflict between the basic interests of the two countries, he is not afraid to draw appropriate conclusions from it. Indeed, if the national interests of the United States are correctly understood as fundamentally not contradictory to the national interests of the Soviet Union, then the path of peaceful resolution is the only possible and necessary path; abandoning or departing from this path is, to say the least, adventurism, and is completely unreasonable and inexcusably thoughtless."

　　"Wallace understands this, so his attitude is more correct than that of the official Washington figures. These officials sometimes admit that there are no fundamental differences between the interests of the two countries, but sometimes they use the so-called 'impossibility of reaching an agreement' with the Soviet Union to intimidate millions of Americans. At the same time, they are now avoiding taking any realistic steps to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union."

　　"American government spokesmen sometimes also issue some peaceful statements, but as a rule, they also use deliberately contrived pessimism to assess the international situation, and sometimes even directly clamor for war. In the United States, this is how the seeds of real war mania, fear, and anxiety are sown in the hearts of millions of people; this creates international tension. Doing so is certainly not in the interests of the American people. The American people, like the people of all other nations, are inextricably linked to peace."

　　"Wallace calls on the United States to return to Roosevelt's policies, and that is where his appeal lies; because real life has proved that in the Roosevelt era, the differences between the Allied powers against Hitler were successfully resolved - this is something that millions of Americans remember vividly. The Soviet people also remember this very clearly. On November 6, 1944, Stalin, in his report commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Soviet revolution, spoke of the decisions of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference on the principles of the future United Nations Charter. He declared: 'These decisions address the differences that exist between the three major powers on certain security issues. Differences naturally exist, and will continue to exist on some other issues. Even differences can arise among members of the same party. Differences will occur even more often among representatives of different countries and different parties. People should not be surprised that there are differences; the surprising thing is that there are so few differences, and that almost every time they are resolved in the spirit of unity and concerted action among the three major powers.' Now, Wallace, in his open letter to Stalin, suggests a plan to resolve existing differences in the same spirit of agreement. One can easily see that Wallace's specific suggestions are not contradictory to many official statements by representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union. We can cite the following such suggestions as examples. Such as: universal arms reduction; declaring all instruments of mass destruction illegal; abandoning interference in the internal affairs of other countries; abandoning the establishment of military bases in other member states of the United Nations; cooperating in the spirit of the United Nations Charter to consolidate human political, economic, and cultural welfare; increasing trade between the United States and the Soviet Union many times over compared to before the war; the withdrawal of foreign troops from China and Korea; and the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany on the basis of strict adherence to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. American government official spokesmen have repeatedly adopted a positive attitude towards all these suggestions, but the difficulty lies in the great disparity between their words and their deeds. It is enough to mention the following: the true nature of the United States' policies towards Greece, China, Korea, Germany, and Japan, the formation of the Marshall Plan and the Western European military bloc, the arms race, and opposition to international control of atomic weapons, etc."

　　"It is here that we also see the greatest weakness in Wallace's open letter. He seems to want to stand above the policies of the two countries and act as an impartial arbitrator. Wallace's wish may be commendable, but unfortunately, when Wallace tries to show the reasons for the unresolved nature of Soviet-American relations, this leads him to distort the facts. Of course, that is not the central proposition in Wallace's letter, and he only discussed this aspect of the issue in passing. However, the contrived nature of his suggestions is very conspicuous. It is enough to give just one example here. For example, Wallace wrote: Soviet-American notes 'are a painful blow to propagandists on both sides who insist that the two countries cannot coexist peacefully in one world.' This statement, at least, sounds strange to the Soviet people. We are fully aware of those American 'propagandists' who insist that the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate peacefully. The whole world knows their names and their bloodthirsty cries for a new war, an arms race, and the payment of billions of dollars to produce instruments of mass destruction. But who can even cite the name of a single Soviet 'propagandist' who claims that the Soviet Union cannot coexist peacefully with the United States? No one in the world, including Wallace himself, can cite one such 'propagandist,' and there is only one reason for this, namely, that the Soviet Union does not have, and cannot have, such 'propagandists.' The Soviet people unanimously agree with the opinion of their great leader and teacher - who stated not long ago: 'The Soviet Union and the United States can, of course, cooperate with each other. As far as their cooperation is concerned, their differences are not of fundamental importance. The economic systems of Germany and the United States were originally similar, but war broke out between the two countries. The economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are different, but the two countries have not fought each other, and have cooperated during the war. Why can't they cooperate in peacetime? Of course, everyone understands that as long as there is a desire for cooperation, cooperation with different economic systems is entirely possible. But if there is a lack of a desire for cooperation, even if there are similar economic systems, countries and nations may still fight each other.' It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet people also agree with Wallace's opinion that there are no difficulties between our two countries now that can be resolved by force, and at the same time, there are no irresolvable differences, as long as there is a common desire to adopt this approach."

　　苏联名政论家李昂捷也夫
  　评华莱士致斯大林的信
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于十六日发表著名政论家李昂捷也夫对华莱士致斯大林的公开信的评论。全文如下：
    “苏联人民以极大的兴趣读到日前报载的华莱士致斯大林的公开信。这不仅是由于该信作者领导着美国进步力量与反动派进行斗争；也不仅是由于这封信的内容，简明地提到了目前国际形势的各种悬案；首先主要的，还是由于提问题的态度。全世界对苏美关系是谈得极多而且也写得极多的。五月四日和九日对这问题所交换的著名的声明，给这种讨论以新的刺激。与无数外国报纸与政治家言论对衬之下，华莱士的言论显得特别好的有两点：第一，它的现实主义；第二，它的言行一致。这两特点，正由于美国官方发言人的许多声明中所缺乏而更形显著。”
    “华莱士是现实主义者：他深悉美苏在当前分歧上有妥协的必要性。例如：他认清那近视的希望也就是种想以敲诈恫吓或臭名昭彰的‘神经战’的手段，迫使苏联在争执问题上接受美国统治阶级的观点，是全无根据的。”
    “众所周知，美国外交上所谓强硬政策或外国报纸所谓‘冷仗’策略，其企图正是在于这种迫使苏联就范。实际的经验已经证明：这种策略，姑不论其他许多缺点，首先就是不现实的，因为它并没有，而且实质上也不可能引起任何积极的效果。华莱士知道这点，并且建议另一个办法，即以谈判解决争执问题的办法，这种谈判应当在双方均可接受的基础上达成协议。”
    “华莱士是言行一致的：他认识了两国基本利益没有矛盾之后，也就不怕从其中作出适当的结论。真的，如果美国的国家利益被正确的认识到基本上与苏联的国家利益不相矛盾的话，那么和平解决的道路就是唯一可能而且必需的道路；放弃或离开这一道路，就不说它是冒险主义的话，也是完全不合理的、不可宽恕的无思想。”
    “华莱士了解这点，因此他的态度比华盛顿官方人士正确。这些官方人士有时承认两国利益并没有任何基本的分歧，有时却又以所谓与苏联‘不可能达成协议’来恫吓千百万美国人。同时他们现正避免采取任何达成与苏联协议的实事求是的步骤。”
    “美国政府发言人有时也发表一些和平的声明，但照例另外又用故意做作的悲观情绪来估计国际形势，有时，甚至直接叫嚣战争。在美国，在千百万人的心中也就是这样种下了真正的战争狂、恐惧与忧虑的种籽；这样就造成了国际间的紧张局面。这样做，当然不是为了美国人民的利益。美国人民也如其他各民族人民一样，对和平是休戚相关的。”
    “华莱士号召美国回复到罗斯福的政策，而这就是他的号召力之所在；因为现实生活已证明：在罗斯福时代，反希特勒同盟强国之间的分歧曾胜利地获得解决——这是千百万美国人民所熟记不忘的。苏联人民对这件事也记得很清楚。一九四四年十一月六日，斯大林在纪念苏联革命二十七周年纪念日的报告中，说到了敦巴顿橡树园会议关于将来联合国宪章原则的决定。他宣称：‘这些决定论到了三大国间对某些安全问题所存在的分歧。分歧自然是存在的，而且还会在若干其他问题上存在。甚至就在同一个党的党员间也会发生分歧。在不同国家与不同党派的代表间，分歧就更会发生了。人们不应该因有分歧存在而感到惊奇，应该惊奇的倒是在分歧是那样的少，而且几乎每次都照例以三大国团结与协议行动的精神予以解决了。’现在，华莱士在他致斯大林的公开信中建议了以同一的协议精神来解决现存分歧的方案。人们可以很容易的看出，华莱士的具体建议，与美苏两国代表的许多官方声明是不矛盾的。我们可以举出下面的这类建议作为例子。如象：普遍缩军；宣布一切具有大规模毁灭性的工具为非法；放弃干涉他国内政；放弃在联合国其它会员国内建立军事基地；以联合国宪章的精神为巩固人类政治上、经济上与文化上的福利而合作；较战前多倍地增加美苏间的贸易；外国军队撤出中国及朝鲜；在丝毫不苟地履行雅尔塔与波茨顿协定的基础上准备对德和约。美国政府官方发言人对这一切建议，曾一再采取积极态度，但困难却在于他们的言与行大相迳庭。这只要一提下面的事就够了。即美国对希腊、中国、朝鲜、德国、日本各国政策的真实性质，马歇尔计划与西欧国家军事集团的形成，军备竞赛、反对对原子武器的国际管制等等。”
    “就在这里，我们也看到了华莱士公开信中的最大弱点。他似乎想超过两国的政策之上而当一个不偏不倚的仲裁人。华莱士的愿望或许可嘉，但不幸得很，当华莱士试图表明苏美关系之未决性的理由时，这使他走向了歪曲事实。诚然，那不是华莱士信中的中心命题，而且他对问题的这一面，也只是顺便地论了一下。不过，他的种种建议之做作性，甚为触目。这里只举一个例子就够了。例如华莱士写道：苏美照会‘对坚称两国不可能在一个世界中和平共处的双方宣传家，是一个沉痛的打击。’这种说法，是苏联人民听来，至少是感到奇怪的。我们完全清楚那些坚称美苏两国不可能和平合作的美国‘宣传家’。全世界也清楚他们的姓名及他们对新战争、军备竞赛、支付成十亿美元以生产具有大规模毁灭性工具的喝血叫嚣。但谁能够甚至只举出一个声称苏联不可能与美国和平共处的苏联‘宣传家’的姓名？华莱士自己在内，全世界没有一个人能够举出一个这种‘宣传家’，这只有一个原因，便是苏联没有，并且也不可能有这种‘宣传家’。苏联人民一致同意他们伟大领袖与导师的意见——他就在不久以前声明过：‘苏联与美国当然可能互相合作。就它们的合作而论，它们间的分歧是不具有基本重要性的。德国与美国的经济制度原本相似，但两国之间爆发了战争。美国与苏联的经济制度是不同的，但两国却未互相交战，而在战争期间合作了。为什么它们不可能在和平时期合作呢？当然，大家了解，只要有合作愿望，与不同的经济制度合作是完全可能的。但假若缺乏合作的愿望，即使有相似的经济制度，国家与民族仍可能打起来的。’正因为如此，所以苏联人民也同意华莱士的意见，便是我们两国之间现在并无可以用武力解决的困难存在，同时，也没有不能解决的分歧存在，只要同有采取这种方针的愿望的话。”
