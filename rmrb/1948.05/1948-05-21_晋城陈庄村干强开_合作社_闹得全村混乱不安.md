Taiyue News: In Chenzhuang Village, Third District of Jincheng, district cadres rarely visit, and village cadres engage in reckless and misguided actions. The leftist, reckless approach has not been thoroughly corrected. Since last winter, village cadres have forcibly organized "village-wide large-scale mutual aid in production," placing all income from the village's sixty-plus households' shops, workshops, transportation, small handicrafts, and women's weaving under the control of the "cooperative." Anyone who earns money must hand it over to the "cooperative," and private individuals are not allowed to engage in free production. The income is then distributed to everyone in the village, men, women, old, and young, in the form of "dividends." The method of distributing dividends is as follows: a full laborer gets ten shares, a semi-laborer gets eight or five shares, women weaving get five shares, cooking gets three shares, old women get three shares, children over two years old get two shares, and newborns get one share. Regardless of the type of production, this share system applies. Under these unequal and involuntary conditions, everyone has become idle, waiting for dividends. For example, Sang Tianxi, a carpenter, earned 50,000 yuan at a wood factory in Fushan last winter. The village cadres forced him to bring it back and hand it over to the "mutual aid group." His second brother worked in the cooperative all winter doing carpentry, ate his own food, and earned no wages. His third brother, who was injured while serving in the army, was considered a full laborer for dispatch work but only a semi-laborer for dividend distribution. He used his own livestock and ate his own food to haul coal for the mutual aid group and earned no money. The entire family labored all winter and only received 20,000 yuan in dividends, making their lives very difficult. Now, the entire Sang Tianxi family is demanding to move out and not live in this village anymore. Another example is Chen Fasuo and three other households, who earned 140,000 yuan (foreign currency) from transportation last winter. As a result, the four families, including the women weaving, only received a total of 40,000 yuan in "dividends," averaging 10,000 yuan per household. This has caused everyone in the village to become idle, living off their savings. These phenomena have not been thoroughly corrected, and there is little enthusiasm for spring plowing and production. The masses reflect that "district cadres rarely come, and when they do, they only sit in the cadres' homes, listen to the cadres' reports, and then leave. How would they know about these things?"

　　晋城陈庄村干强开“合作社”
  　闹得全村混乱不安
    【太岳消息】晋城三区陈庄村，区干部不多去，村干部瞎胡来，左倾盲干还没彻底纠正。去冬以来，该村干部强迫组织“全村生产大互助”，将全村六十余户所有商店、作坊、运输、小手工业、妇女纺织的一切收入统归“合作社”所有，谁赚下钱也得交“合作社”，不准私人自由搞生产，然后再按全村男女老少个个有份来“分红”。分红的办法是全劳动力顶十分，半劳动力顶八分、五分不等，妇女纺织顶五分，做饭顶三分，老太婆顶三分，二岁以上的小孩顶二分，刚生下的小孩顶一分，不论是做什么生产，都按这样顶分。参战和闲人都一样顶分。在这种不等价不自愿的情况下，弄得大家都躺倒了，等着分红。如桑田喜是木匠工人，去冬在浮山木厂赚了五万元，村干部也强迫他拿回来交给“互助组”。他二弟给合作社做了一冬木活，吃自己的饭一个工钱也没有赚。他三弟因参战把手打坏了，在支差上叫顶全劳力，在分红上叫顶半劳力，拿自己的牲口吃自己的饭给互助组拉煤，也是一个钱也没赚上。全家劳动一冬，只分了二万元红利，生活非常困难，现在桑田喜全家要求搬走，不在这村住了。又如陈发锁等四户，去冬运输共赚回洋十四万元，结果四家连女人纺花在内，才共“分红”四万元，每家平均一万元。这样弄得全村都躺倒不动，坐吃山空，现在这些现象还没彻底纠正，春耕生产很没劲头。群众反映说：“区上干部常不来，来了也只在干部家里坐坐，听听干部说就走了，这些事情他们哪里会知道”。
