　　Mobilize the Intellectuals Squeezed Back Home
To the Editor:
　　Under the general spirit of the Central Bureau's instruction to correct left-leaning adventurism, I feel that in education work, we should also begin to correct left-leaning deviations and should quickly transform and effectively carry out education work. In some places, during last year's squeeze-feudal movement, a large number of intellectuals and some old teachers in the countryside were considered feudal or suspected spies, squeezed out of schools, and sent home to farm. They were replaced by a group of liberated honest peasants whose general level of education was very low. They couldn't read newspapers, couldn't do accounts, and had no experience in running schools. As a result, the masses reflected in their work that children in schools couldn't learn to read, nor could they help the village promote cultural undertakings (such as giving newspaper readings, writing mass blackboards, etc.). The teachers themselves were also very distressed. The masses proactively proposed to dismiss them, and individual villages even established small private schools without the government's approval, privately hiring educated teachers. I think if this continues, education work will suffer serious losses, delaying the studies of a large number of children. Recently, many documents have mentioned uniting intellectuals. I think the government should immediately mobilize those intellectuals who were squeezed back home last year to continue engaging in education work and should no longer hesitate. Waiting for the filling movement before doing this work will continue to cause losses to the work and continue to separate it from the masses.

    Editor's Opinion: Comrade Beisheng's opinion is an important issue in current education work. Intellectuals and teachers who were wrongly purged and returned to their villages during last year's land reform should be allowed to come out and participate in work. Comrade Ren Bishi's report stated: "There are still many intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families in rural areas who have nothing to do. We should find ways to win them over and transform them. As long as they express their willingness to abide by the laws of the democratic government, especially the Land Law, do not oppose the policies of the Communist Party, are willing to serve the people, and do not engage in sabotage activities, and are willing to accept government legal sanctions for illegal acts, they can be allowed to come out and work. ... At the same time, more attention should be paid to cultivating intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds." According to this spirit, governments at all levels should, on the one hand, resolutely correct the left-leaning errors of blindly excluding all intellectuals connected with the feudal system in the past and absorb them back into work; on the other hand, they should also pay constant attention to the training of worker-peasant intellectuals.

### 把挤回家的知识分子动员出来吧

　　把挤回家的知识分子动员出来吧编辑同志：
    在中央局指示纠正左倾冒险主义总的精神下，我觉得在教育工作上，也该开始纠正左的偏向，并应迅速转变，有效的去开展教育工作。有些地方在去年挤封建运动中，把大批在乡知识分子及一些老教员认为封建或特务嫌疑分子，挤出学校，回家种地，代替他们的是一批翻身的老实农民，一般的文化程度都很低，读不下报，算不成帐，没有办学校的经验，因之在工作中群众反映，说儿童在校中识不上字，又不能帮助村中推进文化事业（如讲报、写大众黑板等）。教员本身也很苦恼。群众主动提出要解聘，个别村甚至不通过政府成立小型私塾，私自聘请有文化的教员，我想这样继续下去，教育工作要受到严重损失，耽误一大批儿童的学业。最近很多文件上都谈到团结知识分子，我想那批去年被挤回家的知识分子，政府应立即动员他们继续从事教育工作，不应再犹豫不决。等填补运动后再去作这工作，将会使工作继续受到损失，继续脱离群众。　　读者韩北生
    编者意见：北生同志这个意见，是当前教育工作中一个重要问题。去年土改中错误清洗回村的知识分子、教员，应该让他们出来参加工作。任弼时同志报告中说：“现在农村中还有许多地主富农家庭出身的知识分子没事做，我们应想法争取改造他们。只要他们表示愿意服从民主政府法令，特别是土地法，不反对共产党的政策，愿为人民服务，不进行破坏活动，如有违法行为甘受政府法律制裁，就可让他们出来工作。……同时，更要注意培养工农出身的知识分子。”各地政府根据这个精神，一方面应坚决纠正过去盲目排斥一切与封建制度有联系的知识分子的左倾错误，吸收他们出来重新参加工作；另一方面对工农知识分子的培养，也应经常注意。
