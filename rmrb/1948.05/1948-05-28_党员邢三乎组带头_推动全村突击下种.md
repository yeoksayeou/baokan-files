　　After the rain in Xiaotunqiao, the Fourth District of Shahe, the mutual aid team leader and Party member Xing Sanhu (new middle peasant) and the newly elected deputy village head Liu Haiqu (new middle peasant) personally led their group of ten households in a crash planting effort. In one day, the whole group hoed seven mu, harrowed nine mu, and sowed fourteen mu (including three mu of newly reclaimed land). Following that, they sowed three mu for families of soldiers. Group member Wang Jichun didn't sleep or rest at noon, sowing three mu. That evening, the leadership convened a mass meeting of the entire village to mobilize a crash planting and land reclamation effort. During the discussion, Wang Shunjing of the Sanhu group suggested: "I don't have any fallow land (spring land), I want to plant seven mu of millet in the wheat field." Huo Xianbao of the ×× group said: "Planting millet in the wheat field won't work, mole crickets will gnaw on it, there won't be any seedlings." Everyone unanimously suggested: "Sow it more densely, we can't let an area of land go to waste." Huo Juan said: "The wheat planted in the millet field last year grew very well, the ears were big. Whatever the crop, it's better to plant it early than late. We must listen to the call, it's the Lesser Fullness season now, it's the right time to plant millet." In the end, the Xing Sanhu group set a plan to completely sow all fallow land and wasteland within three days, leaving not a single mu unplanted, which promoted planting throughout the village.
