　　Introduction to the World Federation of Trade Unions
    The establishment of the Soviet-British Trade Union Committee in November 1941 paved a new way for solidarity and cooperation between workers in socialist countries and workers in the capitalist world, and for the unified movement of international trade unions. In July 1943, at the third session of the Soviet-British Trade Union Committee, Shvernik, the former chairman of the Soviet Trade Union Central Committee, proposed expanding the Soviet-British Trade Union to include trade unions from the Americas and various invaded countries. This historically significant proposal was supported by the British Trades Union Congress, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and progressive trade unions in countries such as Australia, Canada, and Latin America. After overcoming various obstacles from the American capitalist oligarchs' puppet AFL and union scabs, the fourth session of the Soviet-British Trade Union Committee finally decided to convene a World Trade Union Conference in October 1944. In December of the same year, the Soviet-French Trade Union Committee was established, expanding the foundation for the unified movement of international trade unions.
    The World Trade Union Conference was convened in London on February 6, 1945, under the increasingly mature conditions of the international trade union unification movement. At that time, more than 200 representatives from 38 Allied countries and 7 neutral countries' trade union organizations attended the meeting, representing 60 million organized workers. At the meeting, based on the proposals of Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Soviet Trade Union Central Committee, and Hillman, Chairman of the Political Action Committee of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the decision to establish the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) was adopted. In September of the same year, the WFTU was officially established in Paris. At that time, it already included progressive trade unions from 64 countries, with 70 million members. The organizational structure of the WFTU is: Congress – Executive Committee (21 members) – Executive Bureau (9 members).
    As estimated by the Soviet newspaper Pravda, the WFTU is "complex in composition." For example, it contains various trade union organizations that are the most incompatible, with different experiences, different development paths, and different political strategies. In addition to the most progressive trade unions, such as those in the Soviet Union, the WFTU also includes some trade unions that are still subject to opportunist traditions. Its leadership includes not only the leaders of the old Amsterdam International but also the leaders of trade unions in people's democratic countries. It includes both the Swedish trade unions, which have no war experience, and the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT), which has engaged in fierce underground struggles. The WFTU involves both unity and struggle.
    In the three years after the war, the World Federation of Trade Unions has gradually developed and grown stronger in the struggle to defend peace, democracy, and the interests of the working class, and in the struggle against the American imperialist agents and internal right-wing union leaders. After the establishment of the WFTU, two countries with powerful trade unions joined one after another, namely the Free German Trade Union Federation (with 6.5 million members according to last year's statistics) and the Japanese Federation of Industrial Organizations (with more than 2 million members according to 1946 statistics). At the same time, the membership of trade unions in various countries participating in the WFTU has also greatly developed. For example, when the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) was established in early January 1945, it had only 4.5 million members, but by June 1947, it had increased to 7 million; before May Day in 1947, the membership of the Czech Unified Trade Union was 1,877,000, and the membership of the Polish Trade Union was 2,055,000. By January 1948, the Czech Republic had increased to more than 3 million, and Poland had increased to 2.8 million; in 1945, trade union members in the Chinese Liberated Areas were only 800,000, but in 1947 they had increased to 1.2 million; as for the Soviet Union, in the first quarter of 1948 alone, the number of workers increased by more than 2 million compared to the same quarter in 1947. Therefore, according to incomplete statistics, the WFTU now has about 80 million members. Because the World Federation of Trade Unions is such a powerful democratic force with world-wide reach and mass support, it makes American imperialism and its henchmen very afraid. Before the birth of the WFTU, American imperialism, through the heads of the AFL such as Green, tried to make it stillborn. When the WFTU was born and took its first steps on the international political stage, they tried their best to attack, dismember, and suffocate it, but their conspiracy did not succeed. The imperialist elements headed by the United States have tried their best to prevent the WFTU from participating in the Social and Economic Council of the United Nations. After November of last year, the American and British reactionaries, through the right-wing heads of the CIO, Carey and Deakin, the acting general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), proposed to the WFTU to discuss the "Marshall Plan," conspiring to carry out activities to split the WFTU from within. In order to completely defeat their pretext for division, the progressive forces in the World Federation of Trade Unions have decided to expose the tactics of the "Marshall Plan" at the upcoming Executive Committee meeting. In March, the heads of the AFL and the British TUC convened a "International Trade Union Conference" of union scabs in London, attempting to establish a "Trade Union International" opposed to the WFTU, but it failed because it had no mass base. Up to now, progressive forces have occupied a dominant position in the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions. On the other hand, the conspiracy of American imperialism and its lackeys to dismantle the two pillars of the World Federation of Trade Unions—the French and Italian CGT—has also failed. The American AFL has set up a special office in France to undermine the labor movement. Last November, it bought off the French union scab, Stonehouse, to withdraw from the CGT, conspiring to split and sabotage the CGT. However, the French CGT has become more consolidated because this small group of right-wing elements rolled out. Last autumn, the AFL spent huge sums of money to run newspapers in Italy and instigated right-wing elements to organize another "trade union," but only 15,000 people were drawn from the Italian CGIL, which has 7 million members; the Christian Democratic Party's proposal within the CGIL to "not interfere in purely political issues" was also rejected. The American and British reactionaries also instructed the right-wing elements of the Eastern European Socialist Party to undermine the labor movement by opposing the trade union's "engagement in politics" and other activities; but the result was that the Eastern European working class actively participated in the people's democratic front, cleared out right-wing opportunists, and the trade union organizations in Eastern European countries continued to consolidate and grow stronger.
    From this, we can see that no matter how hard American imperialism and its accomplices try to split and sabotage, the World Federation of Trade Unions is relying on the improvement of the world working class's awareness and the degree of unity, and the future development is infinitely bright, but on the road of advancing under the banner of the WFTU, it is still necessary to continue to overcome greater difficulties and break through the obstacles set up by the enemy. For example, American imperialism and its vassals are continuing to conspire to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions in various countries through the traitors in the trade union movements of various countries; on the other hand, especially at the upcoming meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the American imperialist agents Green and Brown are deploying a sinister plan to split the World Federation of Trade Unions. They instigated the British TUC and other right-wing representatives to force the meeting to accept the proposal to support the Marshall Plan. If this plan fails, they plan to order them to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions and reorganize a so-called new world trade union organization to confront the World Federation of Trade Unions. Therefore, in this impending serious struggle, it will be another major test for the leaders of trade unions in some countries. The Chinese trade union organizations, led by the Liberated Areas, resolutely oppose this conspiracy by the agents of American imperialism, and will unite all progressive forces of the WFTU to fight to defeat this conspiracy and consolidate the unity of the WFTU.

　　世界职工联盟介绍
    一九四一年十一月，当时苏英职工会委员会成立的这一行动，为社会主义国家工人与资本主义世界工人间的团结合作，为国际职工的统一运动开辟了新道路。一九四三年七月，在苏英职工会委员会第三届会议上，苏前任职工会中央委员会主席什维尔尼克倡议扩大苏英职工会，吸收美洲以及被侵略的各国职工会参加。这个有历史意义的动议，博得英国总工会、美产联以及爱、澳、加、拉丁美洲各国进步工会的支持，在声破了美资本寡头御用的劳联和工贼头子的种种阻挠之后，终于一九四四年十月苏英职工会委员会第四届会议上，决定召开世界职工大会。同年十二月，苏法职工会委员会宣告成立，为国际职工的统一运动扩大了基础。
    世界职工大会就在国际职工统一运动日趋成熟的条件下，于一九四五年二月六日在伦敦召开。当时与会的有三十八个盟国和七个中立国的职工团体的代表二百余人，代表了六千万有组织的职工。会上根据苏职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫和美产联政治行动委员会主席希尔曼的动议，通过了建立世界职工联盟的决定。同年九月，世界职工联盟正式成立于巴黎。当时已包括六十四国进步的职工会，拥有会员七千万人。世职的组织机构为：大会——执行委员会（二十一人）——执行局（九人）。
    诚如苏真理报估计的一样，世职是“成分复杂”的。比如：它包含着最不相合的各种职工组织，它们具有不同的经验，不同的发展道路与不同的政治策略。除了最进步的如苏联的职工会外，在世职联盟中还有一些仍受着机会主义传统的职工会。它的领导机构中除了往日阿姆斯特丹国际的领袖外，也还包括有人民的民主国家的职工会领袖。既包括有毫未经战争体验的瑞典职工会，也有曾经激烈地下斗争的法国总工会。世职是也有联合，也有斗争的。
    战后三年来，世界职工联盟在保卫和平、民主和工人阶级利益的斗争中，在与美帝代理人及内部右翼工会头子的斗争中，逐渐发展与壮大起来。世职成立后有两个国家强大的职工会先后参加，即自由德国工会联合会（据去年统计有会员六百五十万），及日本产业别组合联合会（据一九四六年统计有会员二百多万）。同时参加世职的各国职工会会员亦大大发展了。例如意总工会在一九四五年一月初成立时会员仅四百五十万，到一九四七年六月已增加到七百万；在一九四七年五一以前，捷统一职工会会员为一百八十七万七千，波职工会会员为二百零五万五千，到一九四八年一月，捷克增至三百余万，波兰增至二百八十万；一九四五年中国解放区工会会员仅八十万，一九四七年已增至一百二十万；至于苏联，仅在一九四八年的第一季中，就比一九四七年同季增加了职工二百多万。所以，根据不完全的统计，现在世职拥有的会员已在八千万左右。由于世界职工联盟是具有这样世界性与群众性的强大民主力量，因此使美帝及其助手们非常害怕。在世职诞生之前，美帝就通过美劳联头子格林之流力图使它难产。在世职诞生并且在国际政治舞台上走开第一步的时候，他们便竭力企图打击，肢解与窒息它，但他们的阴谋并未成功。以美国为首的帝国主义分子，曾在联合国中极力阻止世职参加社会经济理事会，去年十一月以后，美英反动派更通过产联右翼头子加莱和英国总工会代理总书记狄根，向世职提出讨论“马歇尔计划”问题，阴谋从内部来进行分裂世职的活动。为了彻底击破他们分裂的借口，世界职工联盟中的进步势力，已决定在未来的执委会上揭露“马歇尔计划”的策略。三月间，美劳联与英国总工会的头子在伦敦召开了一个工贼头子的“国际职工大会”，企图成立与世职对立的“职工国际”，可是因为毫无群众基础而失败了。迄今为止，世界职工联盟的领导机构中，进步力量已占有优势地位。另一方面，美帝及其走狗妄图拆散世界职工联盟的两大台柱——法意总工会的计谋也未得逞。美劳联在法国设立了专门破坏工运的办事处，去年十一月收买了法国工贼石屋，退出总工会，阴谋分裂与破坏总工会，然而法总工会却因为这一小撮右翼分子的滚出去而更加巩固了。去年秋季，劳联曾以巨额金元在意大利办报，并唆使右翼分子组织另一个“职工会”，然而从拥有七百万会员的意总工会中只拉去了一万五千人；基督教民主党在总工会内所提的“不干涉纯政治问题”的主张，也遭到否决。美英反动派也曾指使东欧社会党右翼分子以反对职工会“从事政治”等活动，来破坏工运；但其结果却是：东欧工人阶级的积极参加人民民主阵线，清洗右翼机会主义分子，东欧诸国职工组织的继续巩固与壮大。
    由此可知，尽管美帝及其走卒如何千方百计进行分裂与破坏，但世界职工联盟依靠世界工人阶级觉悟与团结程度的提高，发展前途是无限光明的，但是高举世职旗帜而前进的大路上，仍须继续克服更大困难与冲破敌人设下的障碍。比如美帝及其附庸正在继续通过各国职工运动中的叛卖分子，阴谋破坏世界职工联盟与各国职工会；另一方面，尤其是在行将召开的世界职工联盟执委会上，美帝代理人格林及布朗等，正布置了一个分裂世界职工联盟的险毒计划，他们嗾使英总工会等右翼代表将压迫会议接受支持马歇尔计划的建议，如此计不成，即计划令其退出世界职工联盟，并重组与世界职工联盟对抗的所谓新的世界职工机构。因此在这一行将到来的严重斗争中，将成为若干国家职工会领袖们的又一次重大考验。以解放区为首的中国职工组织，坚决反对美帝代理人等的这一阴谋，并将联合世职的一切进步势力，为击溃这一阴谋与巩固世职的团结而斗争。（新华社）
