Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 4th. A certain unit of the local armed forces in Eastern Hebei, active along the Beining Railway line, launched a surprise attack on Xiaojizhen, an important stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits 35 miles north of Tangshan, on the night of the 24th, annihilating a part of the enemy. The defending enemies of the 62nd Army stationed in Tangshan and Hetou, consisting of two battalions of one regiment and a part of the puppet bandits, rushed to the town's aid on the 25th. Finding nothing, they fled in panic and were intercepted by our troops, who annihilated a part of them. In these two battles, we captured 180 enemy soldiers below the rank of platoon leader, killed or wounded over 230 puppet bandit leaders and soldiers below the rank of company commander, and seized two 92-type infantry guns, one 60mm mortar, two grenade launchers, nine light and heavy machine guns, sixteen rifle grenade launchers, 132 long and short guns, over 27,000 rounds of various ammunition, and other materials.

The Hebei-Chahar-Jehol Military Region has recently announced the detailed results of the recapture of Duolun, an important town in northern Chahar Province: A total of over 2,100 enemies were annihilated, including the death of Jing Yingqing, commander of the 4th Security Column of the puppet Chahar Province and commander of the city defense; Bai Jinhui, the second deputy commander of Duolun; Guan Ming, the lieutenant colonel commander of the 11th Regiment (previously mistaken for the 17th Regiment); and over 614 other officers and soldiers. Over 1,500 enemies were captured, including Liu Tiefu, the colonel-level commissioner of Zhaowu Special District and captain of the "People's Salvation Vanguard Team"; Liu Yaxuan, the lieutenant colonel deputy commissioner; Zhang Zhenqi, the puppet colonel-level deputy commissioner of the administrative office and deputy commander of the bandit security force; Yang Guilin, the lieutenant colonel commander of the 10th Regiment; Yue Baoan, the captain of the Bao Xun Brigade; Wang Jiade, the puppet county magistrate; and other officers and soldiers. We seized two mortars, two grenade launchers, ten light and heavy machine guns, 851 long and short guns, four submachine guns, over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, nine radio stations, 895 war horses, three vehicles, and many other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th. The Northwest Field Army Front Command announced the comprehensive results of the pursuit of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fleeing from Yan'an and Luochuan along the Luochuan-Baishui Highway in the Wuzhuang area from the 26th to the 28th of last month: The fleeing enemy Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops of the 12th Reorganized Brigade, the 48th Reorganized Brigade, and the 61st Reorganized Brigade were completely defeated. The entire 182nd Regiment of the 61st Reorganized Brigade and one of its battalions were annihilated, with over 1,600 captured alive and over 2,000 civilians who had been captured by the bandits were liberated. Five tanks, nine field guns, twenty-two mountain guns, over ten 60mm mortars, over twenty light and heavy machine guns, a portion of ammunition, two radio stations, and sixteen vehicles were seized. In addition, two tanks and two vehicles were destroyed. The remnants of the enemy fled westward across the Luo River, and we are continuing our pursuit and interception.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 4th. The armed village governments formed by cadres and the masses in the villages and districts of Pu County in southwestern Shanxi Province have been clearing out scattered Yan Xishan bandits in the mountainous areas of Heilongguan and Puyi for the past month. Seventeen people, including platoon leaders, have been captured. After repeated propaganda of our lenient policy to encourage registration and self-renewal, over 200 people, including the puppet county speaker, have registered and surrendered. One machine gun and 59 long and short guns have been seized.
