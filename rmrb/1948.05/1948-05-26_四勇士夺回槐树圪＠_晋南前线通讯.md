　　Four Warriors Recapture Huaishuge

    On the afternoon of March 20th, the 8th Platoon of the 3rd Company of the 1312th Unit valiantly recaptured the Huaishuge position, which had just been seized by the enemy. This position was a very important high ground on the southern periphery of Dongguan. If it could not be retaken, all the fortifications that our army had already developed or were developing towards Dongguan from the open area on both sides of the position would be seriously threatened or cut off, greatly hindering the attack on Dongguan. After accepting this major task, the 8th Platoon, under the cover of strong firepower, swiftly rushed towards Huaishuge. However, as they passed through the open area blocked by the enemy's several lines of fire, five people were wounded one after another (one of whom was the platoon leader), which was very unfortunate. The entire platoon only had nine people, and now only four remained. Of these four, besides the deputy platoon leader Liu Qun and soldier Wang Fadou who were veteran soldiers, Guo Deqing and Zhang Sixing were newly enlisted, and neither had any combat experience. As for the enemy at Huaishuge, they had ten times more troops than the four warriors (i.e., a platoon), and together with the enemy forces being held back on both sides, they totaled about a battalion, all belonging to the 196th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 66th Division. In this situation of overwhelming numerical disparity, for the 8th Platoon to recapture Huaishuge, considering the 8th Platoon used to be the model platoon of the entire × District, the stubborn deputy platoon leader Comrade Liu Qun, in order to maintain this glorious reputation, did not hesitate to say to everyone: "We must not let the model platoon lose face, even if there are only four of us, we will take it down." Wang Fadou also said: "That's right, we will take it down even if we have to use bayonets." Encouraged by the firm fighting spirit of these two veteran soldiers, the two new soldiers Guo Deqing and Zhang Sixing also said in unison: "Wherever you charge, we will follow." Deputy platoon leader Liu Qun then reorganized the team, acting as the platoon leader himself, designated Wang Fadou as the squad leader, and led one new soldier each, continuing to advance towards Huaishuge.
    Huaishuge is a small hill, with no fortifications on top. The fortifications are all at the front of the hill. Therefore, when the enemy saw the four warriors coming, they panicked and desperately used dense artillery fire to block them. However, the four warriors' determination to recapture the position could not be stopped by artillery fire. Suddenly, they heard platoon leader Liu Qun roar like a fierce tiger: "Comrades, follow me and charge!" He gripped a grenade and ran along the favorable terrain, and the others followed closely behind regardless of everything. In just a moment, the four warriors rushed onto Huaishuge and threw rows of grenades, which exploded in front of the enemy. This brave, rapid, and sudden action by the four warriors completely took the enemy by surprise. The enemy thought that there were many more people charging behind them (in fact, the area was not large, and it would be disadvantageous to have too many people), and panicked and dared not retaliate. The entire platoon turned around and ran away, and the four warriors recaptured the Huaishuge position in a matter of minutes.
    But then the enemy counterattacked, gathering several powerful forces from the Dongguan city walls and Liujiagou, frantically bombarding the Huaishuge position, which had no fortifications. The entire Huaishuge was surrounded by the enemy's fire net, and the four warriors lost contact with the rear. In this serious situation, platoon leader Liu Qun analyzed the current situation to everyone in a calm and determined tone, saying: "Everyone has seen that the enemy is relying on artillery fire, but they have not destroyed our position. The enemy is relying on their numbers, but didn't the platoon guarding this place just now run away from the four of us? Now, if the enemy dares to charge up, we will occupy this high ground and beat them to smithereens." Every word of his gave everyone—especially the two new soldiers—limitless encouragement and strength. Everyone rubbed their fists and said: "Hold on, we will not retreat an inch." Everyone then braved the artillery fire to move stones (there were many stones here) and build simple fortifications. At this time, an enemy platoon, under the cover of artillery fire, counterattacked like mad dogs. The four warriors calmly threw rows of hand grenades, forming a strong fire net. Where did the cowardly enemy have the courage to break through the fire net? They only fired their guns randomly at the edge of the fire net. Later, the enemy felt that several counterattacks had not succeeded, so they dug fortifications twenty or thirty meters away, preparing to counterattack again. However, the warriors' cold shots prevented the enemy from raising their heads. Just as the warriors were fighting the enemy helplessly, suddenly a gray and white heavy object flew over a large road blocked by the enemy and landed on the warriors' position. It turned out to be a stone tied with a letter, which contained words of encouragement from the regimental commander: "The four of you bravely, tenaciously, and rapidly recaptured the position, and then stubbornly defended the position under the enemy's fierce artillery bombardment and blockade. You are attacking well and defending steadily. The entire platoon will be credited once." The four warriors all said happily: "As long as everyone knows what we are doing here, it is glorious even if we sacrifice." The four warriors became even more energetic and fought the enemy. The four warriors recaptured the position at 3:00 PM and held it for seven hours before being relieved.

　　四勇士夺回槐树圪＠
  　晋南前线通讯
    维进
    三月二十日下午，一三一二部三连八班奋命夺回刚刚被敌人占去的槐树圪＠阵地。这个阵地是东关南部外围非常重要的一个高地，如果夺不回来，我军已经从该阵地两侧开阔地带向东关发展的或正在发展的一切工事，都要遭受敌人严重威胁或切断，使攻击东关受到很大的妨碍。八班接受这个重大的任务后，在强大火力掩护下，神速的向槐树圪＠扑去，但是当他们通过敌人数道火力封锁的开阔地带时，先后有五个人负伤（内有一个是班长），这是非常不幸的事情。该班全班才有九个人，现在只剩下四个人了，这四个人除了副班长刘群和战士王发斗是老战士之外，郭德庆和张四兴都是才参军，两个都是没有打过仗的新战士。至于槐树圪＠的敌人比他们多十倍的兵力（即一个排），连两侧被我牵制之敌约共一个营，均为阎匪军六六师一九六团。在此众寡悬殊形势下，八班要想夺回槐树圪＠，是八班过去是×区全区的模范班，倔强的副班长刘群同志为了保持这个光荣的号称，便毫不犹豫的给大家说：“决不能让模范班丢了人，四个人也要把他拉下来。”王发斗也说：“对呀，拼刺刀也要拉下来”。被这两个老战士坚决战斗的精神所鼓舞的两个新战士郭德庆和张四兴也齐声说：“你们冲到哪里，咱就跟到哪里。”副班长刘群随即进行整理队伍自己代理班长，指定王发斗当小组长，两个人各带一个新战士，继续向槐树圪＠前进。
    槐树圪＠是一个小邱，上面没有工事，工事都在小邱下面的前沿，因此当敌人看见四勇士过来，慌张地拼命地以密集炮火阻击，但是四勇士坚决夺回阵地的意志不是炮火可以阻击的。忽听得班长刘群如一只猛虎吼叫：“同志们跟上冲呀！”他紧握着手榴弹就沿着有利地形飞跑，后面的人都不顾一切的紧紧跟上去，于是只一阵工夫，四勇士便冲上槐树圪＠，手榴弹一排排扔到敌人跟前爆炸。四勇士这种勇猛神速突然的动作，完全出乎敌人意料，敌人以为他们后面还有不少的人冲来，（其实此地不大，人多展不开要吃亏的，）慌得不敢还击，整个排掉头就跑，四勇士便以几分钟速度夺回槐树圪＠阵地。
    但是随即敌人又反扑了，从东关城垣及刘家圪＠等地凑成几股强大的火力，疯狂地向着槐树圪＠这块没有工事的阵地轰击，整个槐树圪＠陷于敌人的火网包围中，四勇士与后方失去联系了。在此严重情况下，班长刘群以沉着坚定的语调给大家分析当前的情况说：“大家都看清楚敌人依靠炮火、没有摧垮咱的阵地，敌人依靠人多，刚才守这里的一个排不是给咱四个人一赶就跑吗？现在敌人如果敢冲上来，咱占住这块高地打他娘稀巴烂。”他的每一句话，给了大家——特别是二个新战士无限的鼓舞和力量，大家磨拳擦掌的说：“顶住它，宁进一尺不退一寸。”大家随即冒着炮火搬动石头（此地多石头），垒起简单的工事，此时敌人一个排在炮火掩护下疯狗似的反扑过来了，四勇士沉着气扔下成排的手留弹，组成一股强烈的火网，怕死的敌人哪里有突过火网的勇气呢？只在火网边沿胡乱打枪，后来敌人感到几次反扑都没有成功，便在二三十米突之外的地方挖工事，准备再来反扑，但是勇士的冷枪打的敌人不能抬头。正当勇士打得敌人无可奈何之际，忽然一个灰白色的沉重的东西飞过敌人封锁的一条大路上，落到勇士的阵地，这原来是一块石头捆的一封信，信里面写着营首长的勉语说：“你们四个人勇猛顽强神速的夺回阵地，又在敌人猛烈炮火轰击封锁之下坚守阵地，正是攻得好守得稳，全班记功一次。”四勇士都高兴的说：“只要大家知道咱在这里是干什么的，就是牺牲也光荣。”四勇士越发鼓起劲头和敌人干，四勇士从下午三时夺回阵地，一直坚守了七小时才换防。
