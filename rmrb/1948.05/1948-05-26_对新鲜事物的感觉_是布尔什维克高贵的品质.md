　　Feeling for New Things
  　Is a Noble Quality of Bolsheviks
    Dolgunov
    We live and work in an era when the construction of a classless socialism has been completed, and the transition from socialism to communism is gradually taking place. Inspired by the prospects of a brighter future, the laborers of our country have demonstrated great initiative and an ever-increasing political and productive enthusiasm. This enthusiasm is manifested in the higher forms of the Stakhanovite movement, in the productive achievements of countless innovators in various sectors of industry and agriculture, and in the achievements of Soviet scholars and literary workers. The multifaceted talents of the Soviet people are expanding more and more widely because the Soviet system gives our people boundless possibilities for development and creative courage.

    Our party, the party of innovators, the party of revolutionaries, dares to overthrow old standards and accept new and progressive things.

    Obviously, a new thing is accepted in life not spontaneously or automatically, but is formed in a tense and constant struggle. To support a new thing, to encourage it with all our strength, and to give it all the conditions for growth and formation, this is the duty of every Bolshevik, especially every party leader.

    Comrade Stalin called the feeling for new things a noble quality of every Bolshevik worker. But what does it mean to grasp this feeling for new things? It means, first of all, being good at seeing the future, not sticking to conventions, but relying on things that are small but are rising. It means not being satisfied with what has already been achieved, but constantly moving forward.

    Many party leaders always complain that daily work takes up all their time, which makes it impossible for them to think deeply about the future development of their districts and provinces. In most cases, this phenomenon occurs among people who try to do everything themselves. They are not good at coordinating the work of the various departments under their leadership. Party workers should not take care of everything and replace everything. He is a political leader, and his responsibility lies in mobilizing all the forces of the party, Soviet, economic and other organs, giving them the necessary direction, and urging them to resolutely implement decisions in practice. Only in this way can a party leader be freed from trivial and secondary work, and concentrate on the main work that determines the future development of the district or province, and deeply consider these development prospects to take advantage of economic possibilities.

    In this regard, the planning of a district or province is of great significance. To formulate a plan, we must not only take into account today's tasks, but also see tomorrow. This means that a certain policy must be implemented in the economic development of each district. The plan is a manifestation of this economic policy. Those party district and provincial committees who wholeheartedly work for the development prospects of various districts are doing the right thing.

    For example, last year, the Molotov Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party held a scientific representative conference to discuss the development of the province's productive forces. Nationally renowned scholars participated in the conference. What natural treasures can be developed in Molotov Province? Which factories must be established first? In what aspects should engineers and technicians work? The staff of the province received the necessary answers to these and many other questions. For this reason, party leaders were able to put forward specific tasks to themselves and push party and financial organs to solve the most urgent problems.

    Looking forward means evaluating what you have done, but not treating it as a fixed conclusion, but as a starting point for advancing the movement. Some leaders always forget this important aspect when they summarize a certain movement. They usually just list the positive and negative phenomena, scold the shortcomings, and put forward many figures. Here, they forget about the vivid and lively examples of new things, which exist in any major event. And to promote this new thing, thoroughly analyze its conditions of origin, and focus public opinion on it, is to establish a supplementary source for the more accelerated and forward-moving development towards new victories.

    Naturally, when a new thing begins to happen, it is not easy to observe its sprouts. Lenin wrote in his "The Great Beginning": "When a new thing is just born, the old always remains, and for some time, it is still stronger than the newborn. This is always the case in nature and social life... We urgently need to carefully study the newborn sprouts, treat them with extreme care, help their growth in every way, and 'nurture' these young sprouts."

    In order to discover new things in a timely manner and lay the foundation for their rapid growth, one must have a keen sense. Sometimes, a certain thing often goes through tremendous birth pains before we value it according to its strengths. Those who fear extra hard work and effort, are accustomed to peace and harmony, and live according to the old order are guilty of indifference to new things. Naturally, such workers are slow to feel new things, and they are more inclined to outdated things. Sooner or later, they will become dogmatic people, the danger of conservatism.

    Take the staff of the General Administration of the Sugar Industry as an example. For years, they have shelved many valuable suggestions, which, if implemented, could give the country thousands of extra poods of sugar and save millions of rubles in expenditure. In the General Administration of the Sugar Industry, narrow departmental interests are placed above the interests of the country. Not only do they not support such valuable initiatives, but they hinder them instead. Even after sharp criticisms were published in the Soviet public opinion circles, the phenomenon of dragging on and not using new inventions still continued in the General Administration of the Sugar Industry. It can be imagined how deeply ingrained dogmatism and conservatism are in these places. And why is this? This is because the leading workers of the General Administration of the Sugar Industry have become divorced from practical life and lost their feeling for new things.

    Work experience, contact with the masses, and being good at treating everything from the perspective of the needs of the country give a worker a keen sense of new things. Several years ago, several collective farms in Kursk Province began to adopt a team system of labor organization. At that time, the leaders of the provincial party committee often went to various districts to carefully listen to the opinions and suggestions of collective farmers. The provincial party committee decided to popularize these fragmented experiences, and decided that this work must be done by the provincial party committee, because the provincial party committee is connected with all districts, all economic, Soviet, and party organizations, because it is the provincial party committee that holds the main leadership threads.

    The provincial party committee then wholeheartedly studied the team system of labor organization. In the collective farm, each team was fixed with land, farm tools, and livestock that they regularly cultivated. Each team was fixed with the crops they managed: crops, vegetables, and sometimes grain crops were also specified. Egalitarianism in labor compensation was eliminated, and income was distributed according to the harvest obtained by each team; collective farmer teams that obtained higher yields were paid higher rewards, while teams that obtained lower yields were paid lower rewards.

    When studying the team system of labor organization, the experience of the collective farmers was supported by the political experience of the party leaders and was guided in the right direction. From the beginning, the provincial party committee understood that it was not only necessary to promote the emergence of new things in every way, but also to help them form, grow, and consolidate. The provincial party committee wrote letters more than once to the chairmen of collective farms, the party secretaries of collective farms, the party organizations in villages and townships, and the team leaders, telling them how to correctly organize labor, how to adopt piece-rate wages, how to distribute income, and how to abolish non-personal responsibility and egalitarianism.

    Unfortunately, it is not always possible to listen carefully to the voices of the masses and popularize the experience of the masses. Sometimes, they are limited to writing decisions and instructions that encourage individual Stakhanovite workers and individual units, formally insuring themselves against being blamed for inactivity, but in reality, they do not do anything to adopt and consolidate new things. This attitude towards work cannot promote initiative, but only stagnates it and stifles it.

    Our party organization has accumulated tremendous experience in deeply utilizing the advanced forms of the Stakhanovite movement and new working methods. What does this experience tell us? It tells us that we must help those who adopt new labor methods every day, and clear the path blocked by dogmatism and conservatism for them. However, it is not enough to help only one or two Stakhanovite workers. The experience of the progressives must be shared by all workers. Only in this way can this experience gain national significance. Even so, the collection of the experience of the Stakhanovite movement, the generalization of these experiences, and the dissemination of these experiences have far from been done to the extent that they should be everywhere. Generally speaking, these advanced experiences are quickly praised, but not all of them can find the delicate, scientific, and technological basis, and this basis can precisely become the working methods and rules in production.

    The feeling for new things arises from the party's work itself, which is to unite the laborers in the struggle for new victories in the construction of communism. The party's activities cannot tolerate stereotypes and stagnation. The passion for creation is inherent in a party worker. He critically assesses his own experience and constantly checks whether his experience is suitable for new tasks and requirements. A party worker with a sense of new things never disregards the experience of others and does not consider it shameful to learn and master the experience of others. Some so-called "infallible" workers believe that they have nothing to learn from others, and no one is worth learning from. They limit their vision to personal experience and lock themselves in their own limited circle of knowledge, so they always stagnate in one place.

    When a worker constantly masters the theory of Marxism-Leninism, this feeling for new things becomes more and more acute and sensitive. Marxism-Leninism can help us recognize the sprouts of new things in the embryo and value them according to their strengths. This feeling is forever lively and is generated by the ever-developing Marxism-Leninism itself. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the struggle between the new and the old, the dying and the newborn, the aging and the developing constitutes the content of the development process. By studying Marxism, a Bolshevik can deeply understand the requirements of the party and the requirements of the party's leaders, Lenin and Stalin, which is to pay attention to the newborn things that appear in life, and not to rely on the old and aging things, but to rely on the young and developing things. The significance of learning Marxism-Leninism is invaluable to the practical activities of cadres. The theory of Marxism-Leninism arms Bolsheviks with the ability to foresee and recognize forward-moving things, and the ability to create all conditions for their formation and growth.

    In our society, there is a constant and mass process of the birth of new things and their struggle with old things. Criticism and self-criticism is a method of destroying aging and backward things and a method of struggling to cultivate new and advanced things. Stalin said: "There can be no progress without criticism. This truth is as pure and clear as spring water." By launching criticism of the backward and blaming dogmatic elements, the Bolsheviks clear the way for new things and their consolidation.

    After the end of the war, new tasks appeared in front of the party. The Soviet people are wholeheartedly striving to do everything they can for the motherland. They bring new things to their labor methods every day, and these new things enable us to move forward more quickly, more confidently, and more smoothly. To discover these new things in a timely manner, to maintain them, to enable them to be widely spread, and never to be satisfied with one's own creation, to encourage the creative enthusiasm of the masses, this is the most noble and glorious task of every party leader and every Bolshevik.

　　对新鲜事物的感觉
  　是布尔什维克高贵的品质
    多尔库诺夫
    我们生活和工作在无阶级的社会主义建设已经完成，以及由社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的时代。为更加光明的将来的前途所鼓舞着的我国劳动者们，表现了极大的主动性，及日益不断增长着的政治的和生产的积极性。这种积极性在斯塔汉诺夫运动的更高的形式中，在工业和农业各部门无数革新者的生产业绩中，在苏联学者、文艺工作者的成就里，都得到自己的表现。苏联人民的多方面的才能是日益广泛地展开了，因为苏维埃制度给我国人民的发展及创造勇气以无限的可能。
    我们的党，是革新者的党，革命者的党，这个党敢于推翻陈旧的标准，而接受新鲜和前进的事物。
    显然，一种新鲜的事物，在生活中被接受，并不是自流地、自发地，而是在紧张的、不断的斗争中形成的，扶植一种新鲜的事物，以一切力量鼓舞它，给与它以一切生长和形成的条件，这便是每一个布尔什维克的义务，尤其是每一个党的领导人的义务。
    斯大林同志把对新鲜事物的感觉，称之为每一个布尔什维克工作人员的高贵品质。然而掌握这种对新鲜事物的感觉是什么意思呢？这首先就是说要善于看到未来，不是墨守成规，而是依靠那种虽然幼小，但都在上升着的事物，这就是说，不要满足于已经获得的东西，而是不断地向前进步。
    有许多党的领导人总是抱怨说：日常工作占去了他们的全部时间，这就使他们没有可能深思熟虑地去考虑本区、本省的发展前途问题。在大多数的情形下，这种现象发生在这样一些人们的身上，他们企图把一切事情都自己亲手去做。他们不善于配合那些在他们负责领导下的各个不同的工作部门的工作。党的工作人员，不应该包办一切，代替一切。他是一个政治领导者，他的责任在于把党的、苏维埃的、经济等各机关的一切力量推动起来，给以需要的方向，并督促他们能在实践中坚决的执行决定。只有这样，一个党的领导人才能从琐碎的、次要的工作中解放出来，而集中精力在那些主要的，决定本区或本省未来发展的工作之上，深思熟虑这些发展前程，去利用经济上的可能性。
    在这方面，一个区或一个省的计划问题有着重要的意义。要制订计划，不单是只照顾到今天的任务，而且要看到明天。这就是说，在每一区的经济发展上要执行一定的政策。计划就是这样经济政策的表现。那些全心全力去搞各区发展前途的党的区委和省委，他们就是做得对了。
    例如，去年联共党莫洛托夫省省委，召开了一个讨论发展本省生产力问题的科学代表会议，全国著名的学者都参加了这次会议。莫洛托夫省有什么天然宝藏可以开发？哪些工厂必需首先建立起来？工程师和技术员应该按着什么方面进行工作？诸如此类以及许许多多其他的问题，该省的工作人员都得到了必要的答复。正因如此，党的领导人才能够在自己的面前，提出具体的任务，推动党的和财经的机关去解决最急迫的问题。
    向前看，这就是说，对自己已经做过的东西给以估价，但并不是把它当做固定的总结，而是把它当做向前推进运动的出发点。有些领导人，当他们给某一运动做总结时，总是忘记事情的这一重要方面。他们通常只是把积极的和消极的现象加以罗列，痛骂缺点，提出许许多多的数目字。在这里便忘记了关于新鲜事物的生动活泼的例子，这样的例子在任何一件大事中都有的。而发扬这种新鲜事物，彻底分析它的产生条件，把社会舆论的注意力集中在它身上，这就是为更形加速的、前进的运动向新的胜利之发展，建立了补充的源泉。
    自然，当一个新的事物在它开始发生时，是不容易观察出它的萌芽的。列宁在它的“伟大的开端”一文中写道：“当一个新鲜的事物刚刚出生时，旧的总是存留下来，在某些时间内，还比新生的强大，这在自然界中和社会生活中总是如此………我们急需仔细地研究新生的萌芽，极其关怀地去对待它，用一切方法帮助它的生长，并‘扶育’这些幼小的萌芽。”
    为了及时的发现新鲜的事物，为其迅速的生长奠下基础，就必须具有敏锐的感觉。有时，某一件事情，在我们按其长处给以估价之前，常是经过巨大的诞生的痛苦的。那些惧怕份外的操劳努力，惯于和和平平，按着旧秩序生活的人们，靠得住就是漠不关心新鲜事物的罪人。很自然的，这样的工作人员对于新鲜事物的感觉是迟钝的，他们是更多地倾向于阵旧的东西，他们早晚有变成墨守成规的人，保守主义的危险。
    就拿砂糖工业管理总局的工作人员做例子吧。他们成年成岁地把许许多多的宝贵建议搁置起来，而这些建议如果实现的话，就能额外地给国家以几千普得砂糖及节省千百万卢布的开支，而在砂糖工业管理总局里，把狭隘的本位利益置于全国利益之上，他们不但不支持这种宝贵的倡导，而且相反的去阻碍它们。甚至于在苏联舆论界发表了尖锐的批评之后，在砂糖工业管理总局里仍然继续存在着对待新发明拖捱不用的现象。可以设想，在这些地方墨守成规及保守主义是多么根深蒂固。而这是为什么呢？这就是因为砂糖工业管理总局的做领导工作的人员，脱离了实际生活，失去了对新鲜事物的感觉。
    工作经验，与群众的连系，善于从国家的要求出发去对待每一件事情，这些东西便给一个工作人员以对新鲜事物的敏锐的感觉。几年以前，库尔斯克省的几个集体农庄开始采用了劳动组织之小组制。当时省委领导人常常到各区里去，仔细倾听集体农民的意见和他们的提议。省委决定把这些零零碎碎的经验普遍化起来，而且决定这个工作必须由省委来做，因为省委和所有的区，所有的经济的，苏维埃的，党的组织连系着，因为正是省委手里牵着主要的领导线索。
    省委当时就全心全力地研究了劳动组织的小组制。在集体农庄内给每一小组固定了经常由他们耕种的土地、农具和牲畜。给各小组固定了由他们管理的作物：载植作物，菜蔬，有时还规定了种植谷类作物。劳动偿付中的平均主义被消灭了，收入按每一小组所获得的收获进行分配；获得较高收成的集体农民小组，得到较高的报酬，而获得较低收成的小组，则得到较低的报酬。
    在研究劳动组织小组制的时候，集体农庄农民的经验又被党的领导人的政治经验所支持并被导入了正确的道路。从一开头，省委就了解不但有必要用一切方法促成新鲜事物的产生，而且要帮助它形成、生长和巩固。省委不止一次地写信给集体农庄主席们、集体农庄党的书记们、村乡地方党的组织、小队长们，告诉他们如何正确的组织劳动，如何采取按件工资制，如何分配收入，并如何去废除非个人负责制及平均主义。
    很可惜，并不是到处都能很注意地倾听群众的呼声，并把群众的经验普遍化起来。有时便只局限于去写些鼓励个别斯塔汉诺夫式工作者及个别单位的决定和指令，形式上给自己保了一险，以求避免受到工作不活跃的责备，但实际上对于采用和巩固新生事物方面，并没有做任何工作。这种对待工作的态度，不能发扬主动性，而只会停滞它，绞杀它。
    我们党的组织，在深入的利用斯塔汉诺夫运动前进形式及新的工作人员方式等方面，已经积蓄了巨大的经验。这些经验告诉了我们什么呢？它告诉我们说，必须每天都去帮助那些采用新的劳动方法的人们，给他们扫清被墨守成规、保守主义所阻塞了的道路。但是，只去帮助一二个斯塔汉诺夫式工作者还是不够的，前进者的经验必须为全体工人所享有，只有这样，这种经验才能获得全民的意义。虽然如此，然而收集斯塔汉诺夫运动的经验，把这些经验普遍化，加以传播，远非所有的地方都做了应有的程度。一般来说，这些进步的经验，很快就被颂扬一番，然而并不是都能找得到其中细腻的、科学技术的根据，而这种根据恰恰能够成为生产中的工作方法和规则。
    对新鲜事物的感觉是从党的工作本身发生的，党的工作就是在共产主义的建设中团结劳动者为着新的胜利而进行斗争。党的活动是不能容忍定型和停滞的。创造的热情在一个党的工作人员来说，是固有的，他批判地估计自己的经验，经常地检查自己的经验是否适合于新的任务和要求。一个具有对新鲜事物感觉之党的工作人员，从来不漠视别人的经验，并不以学习和掌握别人的经验为可耻。有些所谓“绝无错处”的工作人员，他们认为自己没有什么可以向别人学习，也没有谁值得他去学习，他们把自己的眼界只局限于个人的经验之内，把自己封锁在自己的有限的学识的圈子里，于是他们就老是僵在一个地方了。
    当一个工作人员不断地去精通马列主义的理论的时候，这种对新鲜事物的感觉就日益锋利和敏锐。马列主义能帮助我们认识在胚胎中的新生事物之萌芽，并按其长处去估价它们。这种感觉是永远生动活泼的，永远发展着的马列主义本身产生出来的。马列主义教导我们说：在新鲜的和陈旧的、垂死的和新生的、衰老的和发展的之间的斗争，就组成发展过程的内容。研究马克斯主义，一个布尔什维克就能深刻地认识党的要求，党的领袖列宁和斯大林的要求，就是要求我们注视生活中出现的新生的事物，就是要求我们不去依据那些陈旧、衰老的，而是依靠年青的、发展着的事物，学习马列主义的意义，对干部的实际活动来说，是无法估价的。马列主义的理论，用预见和辨认前进事物的能力，以及为其形成和生长创造一切条件之能力武装着布尔什维克。
    在我们的社会里正在进行着新鲜事物之诞生，及其与旧的事物斗争之不断的、群众性的过程。批评和自我批评就是摧毁衰老、落后事物的方法，就是为培养新生、前进事物而斗争的方法。斯大林说：“没有批评就不能前进，这个真理是纯洁的、明彻的，有如泉水那样纯洁、明彻。”展开对落后的批评，责备墨守成规的分子，布尔什维克就是给新生事物及其巩固肃清道路。
    战争结束以后，在党的面前，出现了新的任务。苏联人民正全心全意努力为祖国做他们力所能及的一切。他们每天都给自己劳动方法带来新的东西，这些新的东西使我们能更迅速、更有信心、更顺利地向前进步。及时地发现这些新鲜的东西，维护它，使它能广泛地传播开来，任何时候也不满足于自己的创造，鼓励群众的创造热情，这就是每一个党的领导人，每一个布尔什维克之最崇高、最光荣的任务。
