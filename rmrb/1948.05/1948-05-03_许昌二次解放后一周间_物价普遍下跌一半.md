　　Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan Front, 25th. From February 20th, when the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Xuchang City, until the city was retaken on the 8th of this month, in one and a half months, according to preliminary statistics, more than 130 innocent citizens were shot and buried alive by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the East Market. Residents within the city alone (excluding the four passes) were extorted for conscription donations, labor service fees, and other miscellaneous taxes amounting to 300 billion yuan in Kuomintang currency (hereinafter referred to as yuan). The China Bookstore alone paid out more than 50 million yuan, and a single conscription donation was 10 million yuan. Various cigarette factories and shops successively closed down. Prices soared more than tenfold compared to before the People's Liberation Army's withdrawal. By the evening of the 7th, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled, flour had risen to 52,000 yuan per catty, whereas flour was only worth 5,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per catty when the People's Liberation Army withdrew. Wheat rose to 550,000 yuan per dou (14 catties), salt was 120,000 yuan per catty, and a box of matches cost 10,000 yuan. After the People's Liberation Army retook the city this time, prices generally fell by half in one week, with some falling by three-quarters. By the 13th, wheat had fallen to 4,600 yuan per dou in local currency (hereinafter referred to as yuan), flour was 470 yuan per catty, matches were 100 yuan per box, and salt was 600 yuan per catty. The exchange rate between local currency and Kuomintang currency had risen from 1:25 to 1:50. Various commercial firms have resumed business one after another, cigarette factories have installed machines and started work, and farmers from the surrounding villages and merchants from neighboring counties are coming to the city to trade in an endless stream, and the market has suddenly become active. The daily trade volume in the tobacco industry alone has reached about 240 million yuan in local currency, and now various private schools are also planning to open.

  　物价普遍下跌一半
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十五日电】许昌城自解放军二月二十日主动撤出至本月八日再次收复为止，一个半月内，据初步统计被蒋匪枪杀活埋于东市的无辜市民即达一百三十多人，只城内（四关不在内）居民就被勒索壮丁捐、出夫费等苛杂达蒋币（下同）三千亿元，中华书局一家就出款达五千多万，一名壮丁捐款就是一千万元。各烟厂商店相继停业。物价较解放军撤离前陡涨十倍以上，至七日晚蒋匪逃窜时面粉每斤涨到五万二千元，而解放军撤离时面粉每斤还只合蒋币五千元。小麦每斗（十四斤）涨到五十五万元，食盐每斤十二万元，火柴一盒也得一万元。此次解放军再次收复后，一周间物价就普遍下降了一半，有的下降了四分之三，至十三日小麦已降至每斗本币（下同）四千六百元，面粉每斤四百七十元，火柴每盒一百元，食盐每斤六百元，本币与蒋币比值已由一比二十五上升为一比五十。各商行纷纷复业，烟厂装机开工，四乡农民及邻县商民来城买卖的络绎不绝，市场顿转活跃。仅烟业每天贸易额就达本币二亿四千万元左右，现各私立学校也正计划开学。
