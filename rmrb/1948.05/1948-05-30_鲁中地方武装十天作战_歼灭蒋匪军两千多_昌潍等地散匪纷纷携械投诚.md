Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th: After the liberation of Changyi, Weifang and Anqiu, bandits fleeing in various places have surrendered to the democratic government one after another. On the 4th of this month, more than 50 puppet bandits surrendered their weapons to the Zhangzhuang District Office of Yiyuan (newly established county) in Central Shandong. Another group of over a hundred remnants of the puppet bandit Sun Yutian's regiment fled to the vicinity of Yishan. After our local armed forces appealed to them, they all surrendered, handing over one light machine gun, twenty-two various rifles, and more than two thousand six hundred bullets. On the 6th of this month, another twenty puppet bandits surrendered to the Linqu County government with a machine gun. The county magistrate personally spoke with them and issued certificates that day to send them home. After another lone puppet soldier surrendered, handing over a pistol, a district government in Linqu issued a bonus according to regulations and sent him home. The puppet soldier ran back after walking more than a li, saying, "You treat me too well. I still have a machine gun hidden in the wheat field." So he led government personnel to dig out the machine gun before leaving.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th: Nine hundred Chiang soldiers liberated in the Zhoucun-Weixian campaign have gloriously joined the People's Liberation Army. After going through accusation meetings and study to raise their awareness, they have all requested to join the People's Liberation Army. After approval by the leading organs, a grand oath-taking ceremony was held on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month.
