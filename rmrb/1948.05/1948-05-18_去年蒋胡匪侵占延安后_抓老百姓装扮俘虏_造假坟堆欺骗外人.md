Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: After Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Yan'an last year, they heavily publicized their so-called "glorious victories" in attacking Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense News Bureau even fabricated a book entitled "Recovering Yan'an," claiming that "over 10,000 'Communist troops' were captured or surrendered during the attack on Yan'an," and that "'the most stubborn' 358th Brigade, 359th Brigade, and the Second Teaching Brigade were 'completely annihilated.'" These "victories" were ridiculed by knowledgeable people at the time and shattered by subsequent facts. With the recapture of Yan'an this time, citizens of Yan'an and many liberated soldiers who participated in the events revealed in detail the truth about how Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fabricated their victories. The whole trick is exposed. The reporter has selected part of the information to show how the Chiang Kai-shek's bandits manufactured their "victories."

After Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied the empty city of Yan'an, they hurriedly sent people to seize two or three thousand civilians from various places. They were first concentrated in Yan'an city. A week later, they were sent to the so-called First and Second "Patriotic Youth Reception Centers" in Wangjiaping in the northern suburbs of Yan'an and the former Luxi Inn in the new market. Chiang Kai-shek's First War Zone Command organized them into detachments, companies, and platoons. At first, these civilians thought they were being conscripted into the army. After a few days, each person was given a felt hat. The bandit army captain gave a speech saying, "People from outside will come to visit soon. When they ask you questions, you must say you are 'Eighth Route Army' soldiers. You will be shot if you say the wrong thing." Only then did everyone understand a little. At that time, because there were not enough people, many old men were grabbed, their beards shaved off, and forcibly used to fill the numbers. In addition, the "Self-Defense Corps" seized from the Chiang-controlled area of Daguan also participated. Then they began training. Some were assigned to be "Second Teaching Brigade," some to be "New Fourth Brigade," and some to be "359th Brigade." Chang Zhide, a citizen who was assigned to pose as a "Second Teaching Brigade" soldier, told the reporter that the Chiang Kai-shek's bandit captain told him that the commander of the Second Teaching Brigade was "Luo Yaping," who was killed in Jinpenwan, and the entire brigade was wiped out. The names of other regimental, battalion, and company commanders were made up by him. Everyone was taught in this way, and they had to remember it very well. They were repeatedly told, "Be quick in your actions, and don't hesitate when answering questions." Then they were tested. During the test, the "responsible persons" of the reception center asked questions according to what they had been taught. Many civilians were beaten for not answering correctly. For example, when the bandit captain asked an old man from Luojiaping in Yan'an, "What do you do?" the old man blurted out, "I am a civilian." The captain immediately slapped him twice in the face and said, "This is my question. Wouldn't it be terrible if a reporter asked that? The masses who were seized were still far from the real "Eighth Route Army" in action and language. So they were trained in tidying up, singing, playing games, etc. Wang Junxian, a farmer, told the reporter, "People felt as if their hearts were being cut with a knife, but the Hu bandits still wanted you to play cat and mouse!" They trained like this for more than ten days. In early April last year, the "Chinese and Foreign Journalists Visiting Group" led by Chiang Kai-shek's Deng Wenyi, the "Shaanxi Inspection Group" led by Sheng Wen, Chief of Staff of the Bandit Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, the "Wuhan Student Visiting Group," and the "Beijing-Shanghai慰問团" all came. This kept the people at the reception center busy. They were afraid of making mistakes, so they disguised themselves as "Eighth Route Army" soldiers. But in the end, mistakes were made. An American journalist asked an old man who was originally an immigrant seized from Linzhen, "What do you do?"

The old man replied, "I am a prisoner."
"What did you do in the past?"
"I was a militiaman."
"What did the militiamen do?"
"I reclaimed wasteland for two years."

This made everyone burst into laughter. Later, when another Chinese journalist asked Hu Xiaoshuan, because the question had not been taught by the "captain" beforehand, he could not answer and said anxiously, "I am a civilian, a seller. I don't know what you are asking."

A captured Chiang Kai-shek's officer told the reporter, "Hu Zongnan did not only do this in Yan'an, but also in Xi'an." Jin Shirong, a security regiment soldier who had disguised as the "Second Teaching Brigade" in Xi'an, said, "The Qingxun Column is a concentration camp where Chiang Kai-shek's special agents imprisoned patriotic youth, also known as the 'Labor Camp.'" All the suspected political prisoners in more than thirty teams also disguised as "Eighth Route Army" soldiers when the journalist group came. Teams one to thirteen disguised as the "359th Brigade," and teams sixteen to thirty disguised as the "Second Teaching Brigade." If there were not enough people, the Chiang Kai-shek's army itself would change into tattered clothes and pretend to be "Eighth Route Army" soldiers. They were also trained in the same way, and some were beaten for saying the wrong thing.

South of Qilipu and east of the river in Yan'an, there are more than a thousand dense grave mounds in a flat area about two li long. In front of them are wooden signs with numbers and names written on them. These are the fake graves made by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to fabricate their victory in attacking Yan'an. On May 2nd, the reporter visited with the villagers of Qilipu. There were more than sixty graves in the one mu of land belonging to old man Hu Juxing. The villagers said, "These are all fake. Let's dig one open and see!" They borrowed a hoe that was being used for wasteland reclamation and casually dug one open. There was nothing inside. According to old man Hu Juxing, the day after Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied Yan'an, they sent more than two companies of troops; early in the morning, they piled up so many mounds. They (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek's bandits) said that they had completely annihilated the "Second Teaching Brigade" and killed many people from the "Second Teaching Brigade," with more than ten people on one wooden sign. Later, visiting groups and Chinese and foreign journalists also came to visit. Hu Juxing said angrily, "Everyone knows these graves are fake. Hu Zongnan beats and scolds living civilians, but he is so filial to 'dead people'!" Another farmer who was planting vegetables smiled and said, "There is one real one here. A platoon leader of the Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was killed by our guerrillas when he was looting grain in Yanligou, and he was buried there."

"A dead person cannot be buried in the snow." Deception cannot cover up the iron facts.

　　去年蒋胡匪侵占延安后
  　抓老百姓装扮俘虏
  　造假坟堆欺骗外人
    【新华社西北十六日电】去年胡匪侵占延安后，即大事宣传所谓进攻延安的“辉煌战绩”，蒋匪国防部新闻局并专门捏造了“收复延安”一书，说什么“进攻延安之役‘匪军’被俘及投诚者达万余名”，“‘匪’最顽强之‘三五八’、‘三五九’及教二旅‘全部被歼’。”这些“胜利”当时就已为识者所嗤笑，并为以后的事实所粉碎。此次延安收复，延市市民及许多曾参预其事的解放官兵纷纷揭露当时胡匪虚构胜利的真相甚详，西洋镜全部拆穿，记者姑摘记一部，看看胡匪怎样制造他们的“胜利”。
    胡匪侵占延安空城后，即慌忙派人到各处抓了两三千老百姓，先在延安城里集中，一周后，便开到延市北关王家坪和新市场里之原路西客栈，成立了所谓第一第二两个“爱国青年招待所”，并由蒋匪第一战区长官部编成大队、中队和班。起初这些老百姓都以为是叫当兵，闹了几天，后来每人发了一顶毡帽，匪军队长并给大家训话说：“不久外边的人就要来参观了，他们来问你们时，你们就说是‘八路军’，说错了要枪毙。”大家这才搞明白一点，当时因人不够数，又抓了很多老汉剃了胡子勉强充数；另外从大关中蒋区抓来的“自卫纵队”也参加了进去。接着便开始训练，有的当“教二旅”，有的当“新四旅”，有的当“三五九旅”。被派装“教二旅”战士的市民常志德对记者说：胡匪队长教他说教二旅旅长是“罗亚平”，在金盆湾被打死的，全旅都消灭了。其他团营连长等名字由他自己编。每人都这样教了一遍，都要记得很熟，且再三叮咛大家：“动作要迅速，答话不要打哼哼。”随后便试验，在试验中该所的各“负责人”都照以往所教的询问一遍，很多老百姓因答不上挨了打。如匪队长问延市罗家坪一个老乡：“你是做什么的？”该老乡冲口而答：“我是老百姓”，队长即迎面给了两个耳光，并说：“这是我问哩，叫人家记者来问不是就糟糕了吗？但抓来的群众在行动和语言上，还是和真“八路军”差得很远，于是又训练整理内务、唱歌、游戏等等。一个农民王君贤向记者说：“人家心里难受得象刀子割一样，胡儿子还要叫你捉老鼠戏耍呢！”就这样训练了十多天。去年四月初，蒋匪邓文仪所领导的“中外记者参观团”、匪西安绥署参谋长盛文所领导的“陕西视察团”、“武汉学生参观团”、“京沪慰问团”等都来了，这便忙坏招待所的人们，他们怕出岔子，自己也化装成“八路军”，但终于还是出了岔子。一位美国记者问从临镇抓来的一位原来是移民的老汉说：
    “你是做什么的？”
    老汉答：“我是个俘虏，”
    “你过去做什么？”
    “我当民兵，”
    “民兵做什么？”
    “就是开了两年荒。”
    这一下惹得大家忍不住大笑。后来另一个中国记者问到胡小拴时，因问的问题事前“队长”没有教过，答不上来，急的他说：“我是个老百姓，卖东西的，你问的我不知道。”
    一个被俘的胡军官兵告记者说：“胡宗南不只在延安这样，在西安也是如此。”曾在西安伪装过“教二旅”的保安团士兵金水荣说：“青训纵队即蒋特监禁爱国青年的集中营，又称‘劳动营’”全体三十多个队的嫌疑政治犯，在记者团来时也都化装了“八路军”，一队至十三队化装为“三五九旅”，十六队至三十队化装“教二旅”，人不够就又将胡军自己部队也换上破烂衣服装“八路军”，同样也训练，同样也有人因说错而挨打。
    延市自七里铺以南河东边，在约有二里长的一片平川上密集的突起有一千多个坟堆，前面还插有写着番号和姓名的木牌，这就是胡匪为捏造进攻延安战绩所制造的假坟。记者于五月二日随七里铺老乡亲去参观了一番，在胡居兴老汉的一垧地里就有六十多个坟墓。老乡说：“这都是假的，不信咱们挖开一个看一看！”随着借用正在开荒的镢头，顺手挖开了一个，里面什么也没有。据胡居兴老汉说，去年胡匪占了延安，第二天就派来两营多队伍；一清早就堆起了这么多堆堆，他们（指胡匪）说把“教二旅”全部消灭了，杀死“教二旅”的人很多，十多个一个木牌子。后来参观团及中外记者还来参观。胡居兴愤愤的说：“这些坟是假的谁都知道。胡宗南对活老百姓还打骂哩，对‘死人’倒这样孝顺！”另一个正在种菜的农民笑了笑说：“这里头倒有一个是真的，胡匪一个排长到燕利沟抢粮时，被咱们的游击队打死了，后来埋在那里。”
    “雪里埋不住死人”，欺骗总掩盖不着铁的事实。
