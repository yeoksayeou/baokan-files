Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Paris dispatch: The World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to workers worldwide on May Day, calling on them to unite their strength in the struggle to defend peace, freedom, and democracy. The World Federation of Trade Unions (formerly abbreviated as WFTU, hereinafter referred to by its current name) emphasized in the telegram: During the war, freedom-loving people waged a heroic struggle against fascism to achieve this goal. Only by achieving this goal can we guarantee improved living standards and lasting peace, universal security, and the freedom and democracy of all countries worldwide. The telegram, while denouncing the many difficult situations for workers in capitalist countries, said: Wages are reduced to levels that cannot maintain living standards; soaring prices and inflation policies have created unbearable living conditions; fascist anti-labor laws have been implemented in some countries; free and democratic trade unions have been closed down, and the right to strike has been restricted or deprived. But all this cannot stop the resistance of the working masses, who unanimously support their democratic trade union organizations. Trade union organizations and other democratic forces worldwide are growing daily. The telegram emphasized: The working masses have seen with their own eyes that, three years after the victory, many governments have spent large sums of money on armaments, money that could have been used to improve the living conditions of the people. The working masses of all countries long for peace, hate war, and reject and denounce aggression and policies to prepare for another world war. The telegram announced: The World Federation of Trade Unions, created by the will of hundreds of millions of people during the hard struggle against fascist aggressors, has become the center of solidarity and active cooperation of trade unions worldwide. The telegram concluded: On May Day, the working people of all countries will resolutely declare: All efforts of trade unions must be to fight for peace, democratic rights and freedoms, for improving the lives of working people and the rights of trade unions.

　　世界工联号召全世界工人
  　团结力量加强斗争
    捍卫和平自由民主
    【新华社陕北二日电】巴黎讯：世界职工联盟于五一节日致电全世界工人，号召他们在捍卫和平、自由与民主的斗争中，团结自己的力量。世界工联（过去简称用世职，今后均改用现名）在电文中着重指出：大战期间，爱好自由人民为实现这一目标，曾对法西斯主义作过英勇的斗争，只有实现这个目标，才能保证提高生活水平，才能保证持久和平、普遍安全和全世界各国的自由与民主。电文在斥责资本主义各国许多令工人难堪的状况时说：工资降低到不能维持生活水平；物价飞腾与通货膨胀政策造成了不堪忍受的生活条件；法西斯式的反劳工法已在某些国家实行了；自由民主的职工会被封闭了，罢工权被限制或剥夺了。但所有这些，都不能阻止劳动群众的反抗，他们一致拥护自己民主的职工会组织。全世界职工组织及其他民主力量正日益增长。电文力称：工人群众亲眼看到，胜利已经三年，许多政府在军备上花费了大批金钱，本来这些金钱是可以用来改善人民生活条件的。各国工人群众都渴望和平，憎恨战争，拒绝并斥责侵略与准备另一次大战的政策。电文宣布：在反法西斯侵略者艰苦斗争的日子中，由成千百万人们的意志所产生出来的世界工联，已成为全世界职工会团结与积极合作的中心。电文最后宣称：在五一节，各国劳动人民将坚决宣布：职工会的一切努力，必须是为和平、民主权利与自由，为改善劳动人民的生活与职工会的权利而奋斗。
