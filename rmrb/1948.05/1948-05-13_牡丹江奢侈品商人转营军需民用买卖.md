Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th – In Beiman (Northern Manchuria) Mudanjiang City, antique dealers, traveling merchants, and luxury goods businesses have gradually shifted towards developing military and civilian supplies, which has promoted the prosperity of other general industrial and commercial sectors. Last spring, the area from East First Road to East Fourth Road in the city was filled with antique dealers and traveling merchants, forming a deformed development of industry and commerce, and dispersing the city's capital. After last summer, the democratic government explained the New Democratic economic policy to merchants and small and medium-sized capitalists, helping them develop towards "military and civilian livelihood" industries and commerce, and correctly implemented the policy of supporting legitimate industry and commerce. Antique dealers and luxury goods businesses felt that profits were small and the prospects for development were limited, and they all switched to other industries. According to recent statistics from the Municipal Government, there were seven jewelry stores in December last year, but this has decreased to three in March of this year. At the end of last year, there were still 182 antique dealers, but now there are only two left. Other industries and commerce, such as the textile industry, have increased sixfold compared to last year, and the iron and chemical industries have also seen great development. Existing enterprises are also actively expanding production. For example, since the Xinmin Rubber Factory opened in February, its output has more than doubled in less than three months, and its capital has also increased by 40%. The factory is also planning to set up other industries, which will start operating within the month.

    牡丹江奢侈品商人转营军需民用买卖
    【新华社东北十一日电】北满牡丹江市古物商、行商及奢侈品业等已逐渐转向军需民用方面发展，并促使了其他一般工商业日呈繁荣。去春该市从东一条路到东四条路曾充斥着古物商与行商，形成工商业的畸形发展，全市资金分散，经民主政府去夏以后向商人及中小资本家阐明新民主主义的经济政策，帮助他们向“军需民生”工商业方面发展，并正确执行了扶助正当工商业的政策，古物商及奢侈品业等，感到获利不大发展前途有限，均纷纷转业。据最近市政府统计，首饰店去年十二月为七家，今年三月已减至三家，古物商去年年底尚有一百八十二家现已仅剩两家。而其他工商业，如纺织业则较去年增加六倍，铁工业、化学业均有很大发展。原有各种企业并积极扩大生产，如新民胶皮厂自二月开业以来，不及三个月产量已较前增加一倍，资金亦因而增加了百分之四十，该厂并正筹设其他工业，月内即可开工。
