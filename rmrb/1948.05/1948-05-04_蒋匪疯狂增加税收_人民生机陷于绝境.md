Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: A comprehensive report: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime's extortion from the people is unprecedentedly heavy. According to incomplete statistics: For the Chiang Kai-shek central government's regular tax revenue since the beginning of the year, salt has been continuously taxed three times. Since April, the tax per dan (unit of weight) has reached 450,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency (hereinafter referred to as such), compared to 150,000 before the new year. The commodity tax rate has increased by an average of 98% since New Year's Day, with the cigarette tax increasing by 100% to 300%. It was increased again in April, with cigarettes increasing by another 60%, and cotton yarn, sugar, cosmetics, etc., increasing by 20% to 50%. Import tariffs have increased by 50% since New Year's Day. Tobacco and alcohol taxes have increased by 4 trillion yuan since March. The business income tax has increased sixfold compared to last year and stipulates that the full amount must be prepaid in the first four months. This year's land tax collection includes a total of 80 million dan of local quotas. The Chiang Kai-shek central government also establishes new items at any time to carry out extortion, such as the so-called "Self-Defense Special Tax," which in Beiping alone amounts to 1.5 trillion, with the first phase of 400 billion to be collected before the end of March. In addition, it is planned to extract a "Relief Special Tax" of 10 trillion yuan throughout the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, with the three cities of Pingjin and Tangshan bearing 400 billion yuan. On April 24, the Chiang Kai-shek central government announced that it would extort 15 million pairs of military shoes throughout the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas before the end of May. The taxes levied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit local military and political organs are even more burdensome: for example, the so-called "Yin Shang Rich Household Donation" in the Henan Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area this spring alone amounted to 260 billion yuan. In the one and a half months from February 20, when the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Xuchang County, to April 8, when it was recaptured, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits extorted 300 billion yuan in the city. The president of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce said that the city's shops bear more than 30 kinds of donations every month. In the Jinzhong Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan-controlled area, the standard for land tax collection this spring is three shi and five dou of wheat (260 jin per shi), one shi and six dou of horse feed, five jin of cotton, and horse grass as needed. Other miscellaneous taxes are countless. Under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's frantic extortion, the burden on the people in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas has become alarmingly heavy. Chu Xichun, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit governor of Hebei Province, admitted that the burden on the people in the counties under his rule often exceeds 90% of their income. The Chiang Kai-shek Central News Agency also admitted that the donations in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit garrison areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan often exceed the total income of the people. Industries and businesses in various parts of the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas have closed down one after another, and the people's livelihoods are hanging by a thread.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th: The grain in the villages along the Ping-Sui Railway has been plundered by the Fu bandit regime. Wherever our People's Liberation Army has launched offensives along the Ping-Sui Railway, the local people have denounced the Fu bandit's heinous crimes. Taking Beifengyao Village in the fifth district of Tianzhen as an example, the village has more than 30 households, 240 people, and dozens of qing of land. Last year, it produced more than 70 shi of grain, but 59 shi were looted by the Fu bandits one after another. On September 26th of the old lunar calendar last year, just when the autumn harvest season was in full swing, the villagers had just moved the grain to the threshing ground when it was looted by the bandit traffic police team and the Tianzhen Security Regiment stationed in General Temple, and no nearby villages were spared. Shi Benquan's family, the head of the village, had a dozen people and cultivated more than 70 mu of land. After this catastrophe, they only had one shi of grain left. Another example is a tenant farmer surnamed Shi, who worked for a year and harvested two shi and two dou of grain, all of which was looted by the bandits, without even leaving a single yam. The quilts and clothing of many farmers were also looted. Now our democratic government has urgently dispatched personnel to carry cloth and grain to provide relief.

　　蒋匪疯狂增加税收  人民生机陷于绝境
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：蒋匪各级统治机构对人民之榨取空前繁重。据不完全统计：匪中央一级之经常税收，年初以来，食盐已连续增税三次，自四月起每担收税达蒋币（下同）四十五万元，年前尚为十五万元。货物税税率自元旦起平均增加百分之九十八，其中卷烟税增达百分之一百到三百；四月起再度增加；卷烟又增百分之六十，棉纱、食糖、化妆品等亦增百分之二十至五十不等。进口关税自元旦起增加百分之五十。烟酒税自三月起增税四万亿元。营利事业所得税较去年增加六倍，并规定须在头四个月预缴足额。今年田赋征实征借包括地方赋额共八千万担。匪中央并随时另立名目，进行榨取，如最近有所谓“自卫特捐”，北平一地即达一万五千亿，三月底以前为第一期，征收四千亿元。此外，又预定在全蒋区搜刮十万亿元的“救济特捐”，仅平津唐山三地负担即达四千亿。四月廿四日匪中央政府又宣布：在五月底以前要在全蒋区勒索军鞋一千五百万双。至蒋匪地方军政机关的捐税尤为繁重：如河南蒋区今春的所谓“殷商富户捐”一种即达二千六百亿元。许昌县本年二月二十日解放军主动撤出至四月八日再度收复的一个半月中，蒋匪在城内勒索即达三千亿元。汉口商会会长称：该市商店每月负担捐款三十余种。晋中蒋阎统治区今春搜刮田赋的标准为每两赋银征小麦三石五斗（每石二百六十斤）、马料一石六斗、棉花五斤、马草随要随供。其他苛杂不可胜计。在蒋匪疯狂勒索下，蒋区人民负担已惊人沉重。河北蒋匪省主席楚溪春供认：其统治各县人民负担多超过收入百分之九十。蒋匪中央社亦供认：苏、鲁、豫蒋匪驻军区捐款常超过人民全部收入。蒋区各地工商业已纷纷倒闭；人民生机已不绝如缕。
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】平绥沿线农村粮食被傅匪搜刮殆尽，我人民解放军沿平绥路发动攻势所到之处，当地人民纷纷控拆傅匪万恶罪行。以天镇五区北冯窑村为例，该村有三十多户，二百四十口人，几十垧地，去年产粮七十多石，竟被傅匪先后抢走五十九石。去岁旧历九月二十六日，正值秋禾收割时节，该村农民将禾谷刚刚搬运上场，即被盘踞将军庙的匪交通警察队和天镇保安团抢走，附近村庄无一幸免。该村首户史本全家十几口人，种地七十多亩，经此浩劫，只余粮食石余。又如佃户史某，一年劳作所打粮食二石二斗，悉数被匪抢走，连山药蛋也没留下一颗。许多农民的被褥衣物，亦被抢劫一空。现我民主政府已急派员携带布匹、粮食前往救济。
