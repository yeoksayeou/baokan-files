    Last Year's "Great Mutual Aid" Left Land Uncultivated;
    Dawuji and Other Villages Voluntarily and Rapidly Replant
    [This Newspaper News] Congshanlou in Yuanchao First District: last year's mutual aid was just empty slogans with no real work. 373 people participated, divided into 16 groups, all fake mutual aid. Village cadres didn't conduct thorough inspections, which severely delayed spring plowing, significantly reducing the harvest, and many households ran out of food in the spring. This spring, after the masses heard about the Land Law, many were unclear and their thoughts were confused. Village cadre Liu Yuwen enthusiastically explained the policies to the masses, held five meetings, and also spoke at the mass school about this year's mutual aid and exchanging labor: poor peasants using grass, widows using handicrafts to exchange for livestock. He also took the lead. A total of 16 groups were organized. He said: "There are many temple fairs in the spring, let's not buy farm tools or idly attend them." Liu Yuke's group of six households and twelve people had three livestock, two of which were sick. Everyone mutually helped each other by having people pull the plow and seeder, and in five days, they sowed millet and sorghum. Now, the whole village has finished sowing all crops except peanuts. Many groups are also starting to make adobe bricks again.
    [Another Dispatch] In the West Sub-district of the Third District of Pingyuan, a total of twenty-one villages arranged production at a joint meeting of village cadres, reviewed the failures of forced "Great Mutual Aid" in the past, and emphasized that in the future, the organization of mutual aid must be based on voluntary association, and that it is good for the masses to cultivate the land well and produce more grain. The whole village had 110 hectares of spring land unplowed, with 371 original livestock. At the beginning of spring plowing, 23 more were added. Now, the villages are finishing sowing sorghum and are planting cotton and millet. The district took Dawuji as a base point. At a mass meeting, the chairman of the farmers' association said: "In the past, we suffered a great loss from the Great Mutual Aid. In the future, free association will never be restricted. Everyone should plant early and harvest early." Huo Jixing said: "The loss from Great Mutual Aid was really great! Calling everyone to get up early, people couldn't even gather by mealtime. The front arrived at the field but the back hadn't even left the village, and some just loafed. Women who didn't know how to hoe would drop the weeds and just hoe the seedlings. Children, carrying flags, didn't work in the fields but just threw their shoe soles into gopher holes to play. After working in this group for a day, they'd be transferred to that group, transferring back and forth, the land was all left uncultivated, and in the end, no one's land was cultivated well." Everyone reviewed the losses suffered from the Great Mutual Aid and all said that free association was good. On the spot, they found their own partners and organized 18 groups. Now, the whole village is sowing cotton and millet, and production is very active. Huo Jitong said: "This year's land certainly won't be left uncultivated!"

    去年“大互助”荒了地
    大务集等村重新自愿突击下种
    【本报消息】元朝一区从善楼，去年的互助是光喊口号没真作。有三百七十三人参加，分了十六个小组，都是假互助，村干也不深入检查，结果把春耕耽误的可不轻，减少了好些收成，很多户春天没有了粮食吃。今春群众听到土地法，好些人摸不清底，思想混乱。村干刘玉文热心给群众讲政策，开了五次会，又到群众学校里讲今年互助工换工，贫农拿草、寡妇用手工换牲口。他还起来带头。共组织了十六个组，他说：“春天会多，咱们不买农具不要闲赶会。”刘玉珂组六户十二人，三个牲口病了两个，大家就互助人拉犁、耧，五天把谷子、高粱耩上，现在全村除了花生，别的庄稼都已耩完。好些组又脱起坯来。
    【又讯】平原三区西小区共二十一个村，在村干联席会上布置了生产，对过去强迫大互助的失败作了检查，强调今后组织互助必须自由结合，群众种好地多打粮食就好。全村共有一百一十顷春地没犁，原有牲口三百七十一头，春耕开始又添了二十三头，现在各村种完高粱正种棉花谷子。区里拿大务集当基点，开群众大会时，农会主任说：“过去咱大互助吃了大亏，以后自由结合决不限制，大家要早种早收就行。”霍吉兴说：“大互助吃的亏才大哩！早起喊到吃饭人也齐不了，前头到了地里后头还没出村，还有的脱滑不去。妇女不会锄地丢下草净往下锄苗。儿童打着旗子不下地干活，到地里光投鞋底窝玩。在这组干了一天又拨了那组，拨来拨去把地都荒了，末后谁的地也种不好。”大家检讨了过去大互助吃的亏，都说自由结合好，当场就自己找对象，组织了十八个组。现在全村正耩棉花谷子，生产很积极，霍吉通说：“今年的地准荒不了啦！”
