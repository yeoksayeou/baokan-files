　　[Taihang News] The Yushe County Party Committee recently held an expanded cadre meeting to examine the previous stage of spring plowing production. Due to the leadership's focus only on filling gaps and neglecting production leadership, district cadres, after reorganization, were afraid of making mistakes and losing their stance, fearing dissatisfaction from poor and hired peasants. They did not dare to boldly disband or stop the activities of bad "poor peasant leagues," did not dare to compensate middle peasants, and did not dare to lift restrictions. As a result, in most villages, ruffians masqueraded as poor and hired peasants, taking the opportunity to retaliate against cadres, arbitrarily dismissing them, and even hanging and beating them. Cadres and party members lay down and did nothing, leading to a state of rural anarchy with disharmony among the three groups (poor and hired peasants, cadres, and middle peasants), greatly affecting production work. Wang Yeming of Wangjiagou in the Third District, who had been disciplined by the Party, organized a fake poor peasant league in the village, specializing in attacking cadres. Old man Wang Genyuan said, "Some cadres were not good in the past, but most are good cadres. You can't lose your conscience and oppose them all." Wang Yeming threatened the masses, saying, "No! Anyone who doesn't obey will be 'living immortals' (meaning buried alive)." In Zhou Village, people were assigned to monitor cadres every day. In Duanjiazhuang, a few people even threw stones at cadres. Wang Sanhuo, an honest poor and hired peasant (shepherd), secretly told the district cadres, "Things can't go on like this; some control is necessary." In addition, the interests of middle peasants were generally harmed. For example, in Wangjing Village in the First District, a middle peasant received 11 jin of rice for a day's work away from home, while a poor peasant received 22 jin. The cooperative in Xiache Village arbitrarily borrowed livestock from middle peasants. In Yin＠ Village in the Second District, most of the loans this time were provided by middle peasants; Wang Qianxiang was supposed to contribute 6,000 yuan according to his share, but he ended up contributing 17,000 yuan. In Zhou Village in the Third District, which was not a village for gap-filling, nine middle-peasant households, out of fear and panic, lent out more than 40 mu of land; in Zhao Village, middle peasants were not allowed to casually cut down their own trees, etc.

　　After the report, combined with the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee on correcting leftism, and comparing themselves, they conducted a special self-criticism. Everyone recognized the blind leftist viewpoints of the previous stage, such as indiscriminately hating branch party members regardless of whether they were good or bad, and unilaterally favoring poor and hired peasants at the expense of middle peasant interests. At the same time, they determined the methods for handling the situation: for the branches, they should call on party members to play an exemplary role in production. Good branches should be firmly relied upon. Representatives of middle and poor peasants should be absorbed to participate and become the core of the village's production leadership, thoroughly overcoming the current state of anarchy in rural areas. Bad elements should be given resolute criticism. In everyone's thinking, a complete mass line ideology should be established. In the implementation of policies, for middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, things should be resolutely returned if they still exist. Landlords and rich peasants should be appropriately resettled.

　　榆社县委检查生产决心纠左
  　克服农村无政府状态
    【太行消息】榆社县委近召开全县扩干会，检查前一段春耕生产。由于领导上只重视填补，对生产领导忽视，区干部经过整编，光怕犯错，怕失掉立场，惹起贫雇不满，对坏的“贫雇团”不敢大胆解散或停止其活动，对中农不敢补偿，不敢取消管制，结果大部村庄是二流子们冒充贫雇，趁机报复干部，随便撤职、甚至吊打干部；干部党员躺倒不干，形成农村三不和（贫雇、干部、中农）的无政府状态，对生产工作影响很大。三区王家沟被党处分过的王业明，在村活动组织起假贫农团，专门打击干部。王根元老汉说：“有些干部过去不好，大部分可都是好干部，你们可不能丧良心，一律都反对。”王业明威胁群众说：“不行！不服从大家就是“活神仙”（活埋的意思）。周村每天有专人监视干部。段家庄少数人还用石头打干部。杨家庄老实贫雇（羊工）王三货，悄悄向区干部说：“现在社会不算了，不管住些可不行。”另外，普遍的伤害了中农利益。如一区王景村中农出差一天得米十一斤，贫农得二十二斤。下车村合作社随便借中农牲口。二区银＠村这次借款，大部让中农出了；王千祥按分该出六千元，结果出了一万七千元。三区周村非填补村，九户中农因恐慌害怕，借出地四十余亩；赵庄不叫中农随便砍自己的树等等。
    汇报后，结合中央局对太岳区党委的纠左指示，对照自己，进行了专门检讨，大家都认识了前段盲目的左倾观点，如不分是非好坏，一律仇视支部党员，片面为贫雇，损害中农利益。同时确定了处理办法：对支部应号召党员在生产中起模范带头作用。好的支部要坚决依靠。吸收中贫农代表参加，成为村的生产领导核心，彻底克服目前农村中的无政府状态。对一些坏分子，应给以坚决的批评。在大家思想上，应树立完整的群众路线思想。执行政策中，对错斗的中农，原东西在，要坚决退回。对地主富农要适当安置。
