Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Foreign news agencies report: On May Fourth, the traditional revolutionary day for Chinese students, over ten thousand students from more than 150 universities and middle schools in Shanghai held a grand commemorative meeting at the Jiaotong University campus. On the evening of that day, as students from various schools gathered at the Jiaotong University campus, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits dispatched a large number of armed infantry, cavalry, and police to surround Jiaotong University. However, the students remained undeterred and held a large-scale bonfire party to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. During the meeting, over ten thousand students shouted in unison, "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Down with Chinese Dictatorial Politics (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek government)! Down with the Feudal System!" The assembled students condemned U.S. imperialism for rebuilding Japan into a world power, threatening China and world peace and security. They also angrily denounced U.S. military aid to Chiang Kai-shek for slaughtering the Chinese people. During the meeting, students burned portraits of "Uncle Sam" (referring to American imperialists) and "Chinese Tyrant" (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) and performed anti-American and anti-Chiang Kai-shek variety shows. Students danced and sang around the bonfire, and the gathering lasted until midnight.

Another report: On May 3rd, when students of Daqing University gathered to discuss the commemoration of the May Fourth Movement, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in the school used iron bars and wooden sticks to beat students. Many students were injured, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits then arrested four of the beaten students on the pretext of students "fighting."
