Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: On April 28th, when the Allied Council for Japan discussed the "Navigation Safety Powers Act" passed by the Japanese Diet on April 15th, Soviet representative Kislenko, disregarding US representative Sebald's repeated sophistry and blatant obstruction of his speech, criticized MacArthur for allowing the Japanese Diet to pass the bill without consulting the Allied Council for Japan and the Far Eastern Commission. Kislenko stated that, with the support of MacArthur's headquarters, the strength of the Japanese armed forces is increasing daily, and the Allies are facing the danger of the defeated enemy's resurgence. Due to the passage of the "Navigation Safety Powers Act," Japan has been permitted to establish a coast guard, and Article 4 of the act stipulates that "each vessel should be constructed and equipped to be suitable for performing its mission. The flexible application of this article can give the Japanese government freedom of action in deciding on issues such as the weapons of the vessels." Kislenko continued, MacArthur's unilateral actions in deciding on major political issues are not the first. Last December, with MacArthur's approval, the Japanese Diet passed a law establishing a new police system, increasing the total number of Japanese police to 125,000, a number equal to twice the total number of police and gendarmes before Japan's surrender. In addition, MacArthur also allowed Japan to establish so-called railway police. Kislenko strongly stated that it is very clear that the dramatic increase in the number of Japanese police, coupled with the frequent increase in staffing and equipment, is leading to the revival of Japanese armed forces. Kislenko finally suggested delaying the implementation of MacArthur's law on establishing a maritime safety agency pending the decision of the Far Eastern Commission.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Rome, 4th: The secretary of the US Industrial Union Federation, Galais, told the Italian Socialist newspaper that the Soviet Trade Unions' attitude towards the "Marshall Plan" has changed. Kuznetsov, chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Trade Unions, issued a statement on the matter, stating that Galais's statement is a complete fabrication, attempting to confuse the public. People should note that there is no lack of precedent for Galais's nonsense, the purpose of which is clearly to use the prestige of the Soviet Trade Unions to strengthen Galais's awkward position on the "Marshall Plan" issue.

    美帝扶植日本海防
    苏联代表强烈反对
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：上月二十八日，盟国对日委员会讨论日议会四月十五日通过的“航海安全权力法案”时，苏代表基斯连科不顾美代表赛鲍尔一再狡辩和横蛮阻止发言，抨击麦克阿瑟未与盟国对日委员会及远东委员会咨商，擅自准许日议会通过该法案。基氏称：在麦克阿瑟总部的扶植下，日本武装部队实力日增，盟国已面临着败敌重新崛起的危险。由于“航海安全权力法案”的通过，日本已被准许建立海岸防卫队，在该法案第四条并规定：“各船在构造与装备上应使之适于执行其任务，该条灵活运用，可使日本政府在决定船只的武器等问题上，有行动自由”。基斯连科继指出：麦克阿瑟对重大政治问题的决定采取片面行动，这不是第一次，去年十二月经麦克阿瑟批准，日议会曾通过一项确立新警察制度的法律，增加日警总数至十二万五千人，此数等于日本投降前警察和宪兵总数的两倍。此外，麦克阿瑟还允许日本设立所谓铁路警察。基氏力称：十分明白，日本警察人数剧增，加以编制和装备经常增加，正导向日本武装部队的复活。基斯连科最后建议：延缓实施麦克阿瑟关于设立海上安全局的法律，以待远东委员会的决定。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据塔斯社罗马四日讯：美产联秘书加莱曾向意大利社会主义报谈称：苏联职工会对“马歇尔计划”的态度已经改变。苏职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫就此事发表声明称：加莱的声明，是彻头彻尾的捏造，冀图混淆社会视听。人们应当注意，加莱的这种无稽之谈，不乏前例，其目的显然在利用苏联职工会的威望，以加强加莱在“马歇尔计划”问题上所处的尴尬地位。
