　　Nationwide Strike to Be Implemented by Japanese Private Railway Workers
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—Tokyo dispatch: Over 300 Japanese private railway workers began a four-day strike on the 18th, becoming the prelude to a nationwide strike in response to the capitalists' persistent refusal to workers' demands for wage increases over the past three weeks. It is estimated that tens of thousands of private railway workers will be involved in the strike struggle. The labor unrest will affect many private railway companies in Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido, Japan. Another dispatch: The Japanese working people are about to form a united front organization – the "Worker-Peasant Liaison Committee" – to fight for labor rights. It is reported that members of the Japanese Communist Party and Socialist Party have held meetings with representatives of left-wing trade unions to actively prepare for the establishment of this organization.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—Tokyo dispatch: Famous Japanese writer and former university professor Moriya Kin has joined the Japanese Communist Party. Moriya declared that communism is the highest morality of mankind.
