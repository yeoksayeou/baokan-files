　　Caiyu Village Cooperative Leads the Masses to Overcome the Famine

　　[Xingtai News] In Caiyu Village, Seventh District, 39 households faced food shortages this spring due to a poor harvest last year. To solve this difficulty, the village cooperative: First, organized porter teams. The cooperative purchased goods and hired the masses to carry them, earning 210,000 yuan, enough to buy over 1,400 jin of corn. Second, some poor women and hired laborers lacked the money to buy cotton, hindering the development of spinning and weaving. The village cooperative bought some cotton and lent it to poor women and hired laborers as capital, enabling them to start spinning and weaving. They can repay the loan whenever they have the means. Recently, the cooperative also plans to buy two looms and lend them to women who have no other means. Third, it also organized elderly women who did not know how to spin and weave, buying them some hemp stalks and asking them to peel the hemp skin to earn wages. They can also earn firewood. The masses happily said, "The cooperative has helped us solve no small difficulties this year."

　　菜峪村合作社领导群众渡荒
    【邢台消息】七区菜峪村三十九户，因去年歉收，今春有好多户缺粮，村合作社为解决这一困难，第一、组织扁担队，合作社买货，叫群众担脚，赚洋二十一万元，能买玉茭一千四百多斤。第二、有些贫雇妇女没钱买花，阻碍纺织开展，村合作社就买了些棉花，借给贫雇妇女作本钱，使他们纺织起来。谁啥时有了办法再归还。最近合作社还准备买两架织布机，借给没办法的妇女使用。第三、把不会纺织的老太太们也组织了一下，给她们买了些麻杆，叫他们剥麻皮，赚些工资。还能赚柴烧。群众都高兴的说：“合作社今年给咱解决的困难可不小。”
