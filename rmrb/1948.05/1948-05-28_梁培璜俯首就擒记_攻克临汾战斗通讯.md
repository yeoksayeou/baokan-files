　　A Record of Liang Pei-huang's Submission and Capture
  　Battle Report on the Capture of Linfen
    Chang Deng
    Since our People's Liberation Army's powerful forces besieged Linfen, the bandit Yan Xishan repeatedly telegraphed Liang Pei-huang, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Seventh Group Army and concurrently the Commander-in-Chief of the local armed forces of Southern Shanxi, who was responsible for holding Linfen, ordering him to defend the city to the death. He explicitly presented Liang Pei-huang with two paths: one was "success with the city's survival"; the other was "achieving righteousness with the city's demise." Furthermore, Liang Pei-huang's counter-revolutionary partners, such as Sun Chu and Wang Jingguo, also telegraphed him, urging him to "resolve to achieve righteousness." Liang Pei-huang himself also issued "Participation Character No. 114 Substitute Telegram" on March 9, saying: "The defense of Linfen has entered a critical stage. This officer has resolved to live and die with Linfen. If I die in battle, then Division Commander Xu Qichang will be my first agent, and Deputy Brigade Commander Xie Xichang will be the second agent, to continue carrying out the task of defending Linfen." It seemed that Liang Pei-huang had made the greatest determination, either "success" or "righteousness," but what was the result? There was neither "success with the city's survival" nor "achieving righteousness with the city's demise," but rather he became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army.
    On the evening of May 17th, after the People's Liberation Army suddenly entered Linfen, Liang Pei-huang, seeing that he was completely hopeless, took six attendants and fled in panic through the west gate. When they fled to the Fen River, the sound of our army's gunfire and cannons rapidly came from behind, and they had no time to take off their shoes and socks before jumping into the water and wading across the Fen River. After crossing the Fen River, the sound of gunfire still came from all directions, and everywhere there were faint sounds of our troops blocking the routed enemy shouting, "Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed!" They walked all night in shock and panic before reaching the wheat field north of Mawu Village, but they were already extremely exhausted, and several people lay down in the wheat field to sleep.
    After the sun came out on the morning of the 18th, they crawled out of the wheat field to dry their clothes. In an instant, our mopping-up troops approached. When the soldiers of our People's Liberation Army asked what they were doing, Liang Pei-huang quickly said, "Don't shoot, don't shoot, we surrender our weapons!" He immediately ordered his guards to hand over the pistols they were carrying. He also volunteered, "I am Liang Pei-huang, please take me to your headquarters." In fact, he didn't need to identify himself. The People's Liberation Army soldiers who besieged Linfen all recognized him, because in the battle order for the capture of Liang Pei-huang, everyone had already remembered him clearly: "Liang Pei-huang: Japanese-like, with a high nose bridge, dark complexion, already fifty-five years old; a skinny monkey, an old fool, put him in a sealed gourd, and one day he will be captured!"
    When Liang Pei-huang was sent to a certain headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, he was covered in mud and water, haggard and exhausted. Our commander immediately gave him a set of new yellow military uniforms. After changing, he requested to be sent to General Xu Xiangqian's headquarters. When our commander introduced our army's lenient policy towards Kuomintang officers and soldiers who laid down their arms, he said, "I know about your army's lenient policy. Commander Shi (former Yan bandit 19th Army Commander Shi Zebo, who laid down his arms in the Shangdang Campaign in 1945) returned from your place, going from Linfen to Taiyuan. I asked him about it." Later, after the enemy's breakout troops were blocked and surrendered their weapons, Liang Pei-huang even spoke to his subordinates once, advising them, "I arrived two hours earlier than you. They are treating us leniently and generously here, it doesn't matter. I hope you tell the truth, everyone tell your real names and ranks, don't be afraid." He was not unfamiliar with our army's lenient policy.

　　梁培璜俯首就擒记
  　攻克临汾战斗通讯
    常登
    自我人民解放军强大兵团围攻临汾以来，阎匪锡山就一再打电报给负责困守临汾的第七集团军副总司令兼晋南地方武装总指挥梁培璜，要他死守临汾城，并且明白地给梁培璜提出两条路：一条是“城存成功”；另一条是“城亡成仁”。此外，梁培璜的反革命伙伴孙楚、王靖国之流也打了电报给他，劝他“决心成仁”。梁培璜本人于三月九日也发出“参战字第一一四号代电”说：“临汾之保卫战，已入严重阶段，本官已下定决心与临汾共存亡，如中途战死，即以徐师长其昌为本官之第一代理人，谢副旅长锡昌为第二代理人，继续执行保卫临汾之任务。”看起来梁培璜似乎也下了最大决心，不是“成功”便是“成仁”，可是结果怎样呢？既没有“城存成功”，也没有“城亡成仁”，而是作了人民解放军的阶下囚。
    五月十七日晚上，人民解放军突进临汾城后，梁培璜看着已经完全绝望了，于是带了六个随从人员，仓惶出西门逃命去了。逃到汾河边，我军的枪声炮声急速地从后面飞来，他们也来不及脱下鞋袜，就跳下水去淌过汾河。过了汾河，枪声仍然从四方八面传来，并且到处隐隐约约传来我堵溃的部队缴枪不杀的喊叫声，他们又惊又急走了一个通夜才到马务村北的麦地里，但是已经疲惫极了，有几个人便躺在麦地里睡觉了。
    十八号早上太阳出来后，他们从麦地里爬出来晒衣服。一霎时我堵溃的搜罗部队逼近了，当我解放军的战士一问干什么的，梁培璜就连忙说道：“不要打，不要打，我们缴枪！”马上叫他的卫士把带的几支手枪缴出来了。他并且自动报名道：“我就是梁培璜，请把我带到你们司令部去。”其实不用他自报，我围攻临汾的解放军战士们都认得他出来，因为在活捉梁培璜这张战地传令中，大家已经把他记得很清楚：“梁培璜：日本胡，高鼻梁，黑糊糊，年纪已经五十五；瘦皮猴，老糊涂，把他装在闷葫芦，总有一天作俘虏！”
    梁培璜被送到人民解放军某司令部时，他满身又湿又泥，憔悴而疲惫。我某司令员当即送给他一套黄色的新军装，换好后，他又要求把他送到徐向前将军的司令部去。当我某司令向他介绍我军对放下武器之国民党军官兵的宽大政策时，他说：“贵军的宽大政策我知道，史军长（前阎匪十九军军长史泽波，一九四五年在上党战役时放下武器。）在你们那里回来时，是从临汾回太原去的，我问过他。”后来敌人突围部队被我堵击放下武器后，梁培璜他还对他的部下讲过一次话，劝他的部属说：“我比你们早来两个钟头了，这边对我们宽大优待，没有关系，希望你们说实话，大家把真实的姓名和职别都说出来，不要恐惧。”他对我军的宽大政策不是生疏的。
