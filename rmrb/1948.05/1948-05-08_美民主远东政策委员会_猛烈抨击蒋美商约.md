　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Washington dispatch: As the US Senate began debating the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce, the US Democratic Far East Policy Committee launched a fierce attack on the treaty. Russell's group, representing the committee, stated vehemently before the US Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the 27th of last month that the treaty would economically reduce China to a US colony, and the result would be that China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime) would become a US puppet state, which is precisely the goal pursued by current US policy. Russell stated that the Democratic Far East Policy Committee opposes the passage of the treaty. Russell said: The Nanjing government, controlled by the Four Big Families, will not rule China for long. This government does not represent the people, and the political parties opposing Chiang Kai-shek (referring to the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties) have officially announced that they will not recognize the treaty and any other treaties signed by the Chiang government. The Chiang-US "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" was signed in November 1946, and the Chiang government immediately ratified it. According to US constitutional procedures, it still requires approval by the US Senate.

  　猛烈抨击蒋美商约
    【新华社陕北五日电】华盛顿讯：在美参议院开始辩论蒋美商约时，美民主远东政策委员会对该约加以猛烈抨击。该委员会代表罗素尔小组上月二十七日在美参院外交小组委会上力称：该条约将使中国在经济上沦为美国的殖民地，其结果并将使中国（指蒋匪政权）成为美国的傀儡国，而这正是当前美国政策所追求的目的。罗氏表示民主远东政策委员会反对通过该条约，罗氏说：掌握在四大家族手中的南京政府将不会长期统治中国，该政府并不代表人民，而反对蒋介石的政党（按指中国共产党及其他民主党派）已正式宣布不承认该条约及蒋政府所签订的其他任何条约。按蒋美“友好通商航海条约”自一九四六年十一月签字后，蒋政府当即予以批准，美国方面按宪法规定手续尚须经美参议院批准。
