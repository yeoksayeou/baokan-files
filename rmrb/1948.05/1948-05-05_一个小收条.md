[Report from the Jinan Front, This Newspaper, 2nd] The field army on the Jinan front was overjoyed to hear that the brother troops on the Northwest battlefield had recovered the democratic holy land of Yan'an. Because the troops were in the trenches, engaged in intense combat with the enemy, there was no time to hold large-scale celebration meetings. The comrades in the trenches immediately started working, composing clapper talk and creating blackboards to celebrate the recovery of Yan'an. The Seventh Platoon (Zhang Gengwu Platoon) of the Eighth Company of the 206th Unit composed a clapper talk that spread throughout the trenches. The title of this clapper talk is "A Small Receipt," and the original text is as follows:

	Chiang Kai-shek, made in the USA, relies on your godfather
		to support your back,
		Relying on Truman, selling out the country for civil war is no
		small crime.
		A weasel wants to eat swan meat,妄想 trying to
		eliminate the liberated areas, resulting in送枪又送炮, becoming a transportation team.
		Last March you occupied Yan'an, and this April you rolled out of there.
		This is a big change, and the accounts should be settled.
		Just talking about our Seventh Platoon, we fought five battles in a year,
		How many guns and cannons did we receive from you? Here’s a small receipt for you;
		Received today, received today, one small sixty mortar,
		Two and a half light and heavy machine guns, forty-two rifles,
		And two submachine guns, mostly made in the USA;
		Two telephone sets, brand new, durable, and very light;
		Captured ninety-five of your soldiers, some of whom are very young.
		Because we often interact with you, it is necessary to do a little accounting;
		Here’s a small receipt for you, so you can report it to your godfather for reimbursement.

　　一个小收条
    【本报晋南前线二日电】晋南前线野战军，听到西北战场的兄弟部队收复民主圣地延安以后，全体指战员欢喜得蹦蹦跳跳。因为部队都是在战壕里，同敌人进行着紧张的战斗，一时来不及召开大规模的祝捷大会，各战壕的战士同志们，首先就纷纷劳动的在战斗中编快板，出黑板报，以庆祝延安的收复。二○六部队，八连七班（张庚午班）编的一个快板，传遍了各个战壕，这个快板的题目，叫做“一个小收条”，原文如下：
    蒋介石，美国造，靠你干爹
     撑后腰，
     凭上杜鲁门，卖国内战罪不
     小。
     黄鼠狼想吃天鹅肉，妄想把
     解放区消灭掉，结果送枪又送炮，运输队给
     当的牢。
     去年三月你把延安占，今年四月你就滚了蛋。
     这是一个大转变，有帐应该算一算。
     光说我们第七班，一年打了五次战，
     收到你多少枪和炮，给你打个小收条；
     今收到，今收到，一门小小六○炮，
     轻重机枪两挺半，步枪四十又两条，
     还有两支冲锋枪，大部都是美国造；
     电话机子有两部，崭新耐用很轻巧；
     俘虏你的士兵九十五，可有几个年纪小。
     因为和你常交往，算个小帐是必要；
     给你打个小收条，你好给你干爹作报销。
