Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Tianjin News: The student unions of eleven universities in Beiping, Tianjin and Tanggu established a joint association on April 20th to strengthen unity and prepare to resist further persecution by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It is reported that the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek is extremely frightened by the great power shown by the student movements against oppression and hunger in Beiping and Tianjin. After ordering his special agent organs in Beiping and Tianjin to sabotage in various ways without success, he sent bandit Chen Xueping to Beiping on April 16th to suppress the movement on the spot. After bandit Chen arrived in Beiping, student representatives from the Teachers College presented ten demands to bandit Chen on the 18th: (1) Severely punish the murderers of "April 9th" and "April 11th"; (2) Severely punish those who directed the atrocities and the security authorities of the Chiang Kai-shek government; (3) Compensate for all public and private losses and medical expenses for injured students; (4) Revoke the order to "ban the North China Student Federation"; (5) Do not fabricate names to search and arrest students in schools, and stop summoning the twelve students of Peking University; (6) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future; (7) Increase education funding to 15% of the total budget; (8) Reasonably adjust the treatment of public education personnel; (9) All students above the junior college level in the whole country (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas) should be given full public funding; (10) Increase subsidies for private schools nationwide (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas). The students of the Teachers College also demanded that bandit Chen reply immediately. However, bandit Chen not only did not accept the students' demands, but also claimed that Chiang Kai-shek said students "will have a great misfortune happen one day, and the Teachers College incident is the beginning of this incident. In the future, if there is solid evidence, they will be publicly arrested."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Beiping News: The "Joint Association for Rescuing the Education Crisis," jointly organized by the student unions of five universities in Beiping, including Yenching University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Teachers College, and Sino-French University, held an emergency relief donation to help poor students maintain their studies. It is reported that the fundraising began separately in various schools on March 15th, registration for students seeking assistance began on the 19th, and ended on the 24th. The relief funds were distributed by April 4th. According to the announcement, a total of 440 million yuan was raised, and a total of 836 students registered. According to the investigation by the Joint Association, they should all be given relief, but because of the lack of funds, only 626 people who were most in need of relief were approved. Each person received an average of only 700,000 yuan. Although the amount is small, the spirit of mutual assistance among students is touching.

　　平津学生加强团结抵抗蒋匪迫害
  　蒋贼派陈雪屏赴平镇压
    【新华社陕北一日电】津报讯：平津唐十一院校学生自治会已于四月二十日成立联合会，以加强团结准备抵抗将匪进一步迫害。据悉，匪首蒋介石对平津学生反压迫反饥饿学潮所表现的伟大威力极为恐惧，在命令其平津特务机关多方破坏无效之后，复于四月十六日派遣陈匪雪屏赴北平就地镇压。陈匪抵平后，师院学生代表于十八日即向陈匪提出十项要求：（一）严惩“四、九”“四、十一”凶手；（二）严惩暴行主持者及蒋政府治安当局；（三）赔偿一切公私损失及受伤学生医药费；（四）撤消“查禁华北学联”命令；（五）不得捏造名义向学校搜索逮捕学生，并停止传讯北大十二名学生；（六）保证今后不再发生类似事件；（七）提高教育经费至占总预算百分之十五；（八）合理调整公教人员待遇；（九）全国（指蒋区）专科以上学生全体发给全公费；（十）增加全国（指蒋区）私立学校津贴。师院学生并要求陈匪立即答复。但陈匪不但未接受学生要求，反而声称：蒋匪对学生“将有一天会有大不幸事件发生，师院事件就是这事件的开始，今后如有确实证据，即公开逮捕。”
    【新华社陕北二日电】北平讯：平市燕京、北大、清华、师院、中法等五大学学生自治会联合组织的“抢救教育危机联合会”，为帮助贫苦同学维持学业，曾举行紧急救济募捐。据悉募捐于三月十五日在各校分别开始，十九日开始登记求助同学，二十四日截止，至四月四日已将救济款发放完毕。据公布，共募得四亿四千万元，登记的同学共八百三十六人。据联合会调查，他们都是应当救济的，但因款子少，只核准最急需救济的六百二十六人，平均每人仅得到七十万元，数目虽小，同学互助的精神却是感人的。
