　　Jiluyu Regional Armed Militia Bravely Fights Back Against Raids
  　Annihilating More Than Eighty Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Paratroopers
    [This newspaper's Jiluyu dispatch on the 22nd] Henan General Branch News: Our Third Military Sub-district’s militia and local troops maneuvered in coordination to fight back against the raids, causing the enemy to panic and be restless. On May 10th, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek bandit paratroopers, cooperating with more than a thousand local bandits, launched a joint attack on Mengzhai, north of the old Yellow River in Yucheng. The Independent First Battalion of our Third Military Sub-district took the initiative to attack the enemy, and in a two-hour battle, killed and captured more than fifty enemy soldiers, seizing ten rifles, one carbine, and one Thompson submachine gun. The enemy abandoned twenty-five corpses and fled in a panic. During the counter-raid, from the 1st to the 15th, the battalion took the initiative to fight four times (the results of the first three battles are unknown), recovered 400 jin of electrical wire, and reclaimed much of the property that the enemy had looted from the masses, preventing small enemy armed forces from daring to plunder more than five li away. The people's morale is stable, and prices have fallen. The military region issued a special commendation for the troop's active defense of the people's interests. From April 30th to May 4th, our military sub-district and county militia fought eight battles in five days, wounding two soldiers from the enemy's 5th Division, capturing six alive, seizing one rifle and two horses. The enemy built a fortified village in Chenmanzhuang. When they swept south of Shan County, our militia took the opportunity to immediately destroy the fortified village. When the enemy heard about it, they were extremely alarmed and returned to the area overnight, traveling more than a hundred li. The militia completed the task of containing the enemy, coordinating with the counter-raid in southern Shan County. Since the 70th Division began building the Jin (Xiang) - Cheng (Wu) highway, establishing strongholds, and carrying out suppression raids on the 23rd of last month, the Chengtiao militia has fought twenty battles in twenty days, killing more than twenty enemy soldiers, seizing twelve rifles, one warhorse, and more than 400 jin of electrical wire.
    [This newspaper's Jiluyu dispatch on the 22nd] Henan General Branch reports: On May 12th, two companies of the enemy paratrooper headquarters in Dangshan, cooperating with a total of 500 local bandits, attempted to establish strongholds in Jia Village and Guo Zhang Village, north of Dangshan. A unit of our Third Military Sub-district's armed forces launched a surprise attack on the enemy that night, killing and wounding 24 enemy soldiers, capturing ten enemy soldiers, and seizing ten rifles and 250 rounds of ammunition. On the 18th, our Huashan County Brigade ambushed the enemy on the Fengdang Road, capturing seven enemy soldiers and seizing 5,000 rounds of ammunition, one cart, and a portion of military supplies. The Third Military Sub-district took the initiative to seek opportunities to strike the enemy in the midst of the enemy's raids, and the military region gave it a special commendation.

　　冀鲁豫地武民兵英勇反扫荡
  　歼灭蒋匪伞兵八十余
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】河南总支社消息：我三分区民兵地方部队机动配合反扫荡，敌人慌手慌脚，行止不安。五月十日，蒋匪伞兵一个营配合土顽共千余人，由虞城出发合击老黄河北岸的孟砦，我三分区独立一营主动向敌出击，战斗二小时，毙俘敌人共五十余人，缴步枪十支，卡宾自动步枪一支，汤姆冲锋式一支，敌弃尸二十五具，狼狈逃窜。在反扫荡中，该营从一号至十五号，主动作战四次（前三次战果不详），收电线四百斤，夺回被敌抢走群众的东西甚多，使敌人小股武装不敢出五里地以外抢掠。老百姓情绪稳定，物价下降，对该部队积极保卫群众利益的斗争，军区特通令表扬。从四月三十到五月四日，我军县民兵五天八战，打伤敌整五师二人，活捉六人，得步枪一支，马两匹。敌人在陈满庄修了围砦，当其向单县以南扫荡时，我民兵就乘机马上将围砦破毁，敌人听说后，张惶异常，一夜百余里返回该地。民兵完成牵制了敌人任务，配合了单南反扫荡。城桃民兵自七十师上月二十三日修筑金（乡）城（武）公路，按设据点清剿扫荡以来，二十天作战二十次，毙敌二十余，缴枪十二支，战马一匹，电线四百余斤。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】河南总支社报导：五月十二日砀山敌伞兵总队两个连，配合土顽共五百人至砀山北贾庄、郭张庄企图按设据点，我三分区武装一部，当夜对敌展开强袭，毙伤敌二十四名，俘敌十名，缴步枪十支，子弹二百五十发。十八日，我华山县大队，在丰砀路上设伏，俘敌七名，缴获子弹五千发，大车一辆，文件军用品一部。三分区在敌扫荡环境之下，主动寻机打击敌人，军区特予以表扬。
