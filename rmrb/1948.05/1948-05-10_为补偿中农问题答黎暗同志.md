　　Answering Comrade Li An Regarding the Issue of Compensating Middle Peasants

Comrade Editor:

    The Central Bureau instructed the Taiyue District Party Committee to correct the policies and rectify the "leftist" adventurism. After reading it, I have some questions that I don't understand and would like to discuss. Please answer them when you have time:

    1. I very much agree with the issue of uniting with middle peasants, and I am earnestly implementing it in the current land reform work. We have realized the importance of uniting with middle peasants regarding the hiring of poor peasants. However, there is a problem among village cadres and hired poor peasants concerning the correction of wrongly labeled middle peasant status and the return of the fruits of wrongly labeled middle peasants that are currently held by the farmers' association. It is easier to get through to people in villages where there are few wrongly labeled middle peasants, but it is not easy in places where there are many wrongly labeled middle peasants. For example, in Ruzuo Group of Yongnian Second District, the status of five wrongly labeled middle peasant households was corrected in Zhengjiaying. At first, the masses were very satisfied, but when it came to returning a large cart that the farmers' association had stored for him, everyone expressed their opinions and disagreed with returning it. After studying it again according to the latest Central Committee's spirit of class division, there were no more objections. But in Xiaolongma, this issue is difficult to handle. According to yesterday's report: about thirty households in the whole village were wrongly labeled as middle peasants, and eight of them were new middle peasants who had no problems of increasing assets or reversing tenancy, and the rest were either somewhat related to the Japanese collaborators or had some "roughness" (problems). Now most of the things preserved by the farmers' association belong to these households, and these people have all been swept out of their homes. We raised this issue in the village cadre team meeting for research. They said, "Let's just consider it done! It's not enough to return the things of the farmers' association to the wrongly labeled middle peasants to compensate for their losses, their pits are the biggest." After our persuasion and mobilization, seventeen households were corrected on the evening of the 23rd, but when the meeting was convened on the 24th, everyone did not come. The village cadre team leader said: "Everything has been corrected, and things have to be returned, so there's nothing for us, so there's no point in having a meeting." Of course, I know that this is the farmers' simple economic viewpoint and backward thinking. But in villages with many households that have been wrongly labeled, this issue is difficult to resolve among the hired poor peasants. We can only guide them correctly or talk about the middle peasant policy. We cannot force the masses to return the fruits. In Xiaolongma, if the things of the wrongly labeled middle peasants are completely returned now, it would be to become separated from the hired poor peasants. Therefore, it has now been decided to first return the things of the middle peasants who have no "roughness," and the wrongly labeled middle peasants who have "roughness" will be dealt with later. Does this count as accommodating the backward thinking of the hired poor peasants? If we don't do this, what should we do if they don't come to the meeting? What should be done in villages with many wrongly labeled middle peasants? Of course, we should grasp the middle peasant policy. How can we ensure that the hired poor peasants do not become separated from us and that the fruits of the middle peasants are returned?

    2. "All houses of landlords and rich peasants should be unsealed immediately..." I have considered this for a long time, and I always feel that it is inappropriate in my mind. For landlords, according to the Land Law, the farmers' association should accept everything from the landlords and then distribute a share to them. I think that the share given to the landlords does not necessarily have to be the original houses, land, and furniture. It is the same to distribute another share to them from the village. Now, is unsealing them immediately to let them live in their original houses? If they are not allowed to live in their original houses, then according to the population and housing distribution in the village, they should live wherever they should live. What is the point of unsealing or not unsealing? (I am talking about my work area, when landlords were swept out of their homes, each person had a quilt, pots, bowls, spoons, and simple furniture.) Perhaps I have problems in my thinking. Regarding the issue of hidden wealth, it is said that he should be ordered to hand it over, or people should be sent to dig it out together with him. If he says he doesn't have it, then he doesn't have it. No landlord would say he has it. It is still necessary to study it based on the masses, neighbors, and neighborhood committees. I think that the instructions of the Central Bureau can be implemented in areas that have been re-examined and have a mass foundation. If the mass mobilization has no foundation, and the class hatred of the hired poor peasants towards the landlords is not the same as in the old areas, then doing so will easily blur the class consciousness of the masses.

    3. "The industry and commerce (including the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants in urban and rural areas) must be resolutely protected and must not be violated..." In the countryside, do the oil mills and flour mills of landlords and rich peasants count as sideline businesses or commercial businesses? One family is a landlord with hired labor, but in 1940, he opened an oil mill. The oil mill processes oil for nine months a year, and the livestock and hired labor are used entirely by the oil mill when they are not farming. The oil cakes produced by the oil mill are also used as fertilizer for the land, and the family members also sell the oil in retail to earn money. The flower seeds planted in the fields are also used as oil pressing materials. These oil pressers all eat the grain produced by their own families, and the accountant is the landlord himself. Does this count as a family sideline business or a commercial business? We have two opinions after researching it. Some say that it is inseparable from the family's feudal exploitation and should be considered a family sideline business and should be confiscated (it has already been confiscated). Others say that it provides food for other people and turns raw materials into goods for social use, so it should be considered a rural workshop and should not be confiscated. Which of these two opinions is correct? Then, if it is a commercial business, should it be returned to the landlord? Farmers also use it to press oil now, which is equally beneficial to society, so what should we do?

    On the first page of the People's Daily on April 23, after the discussion and research, the editor's note said: "It is wrong to have the words 'upper middle peasant' and 'lower middle peasant' in the wrongly classified class..."

    In the classification of classes in the countryside, there is a distinction between upper middle peasants and middle-middle and lower-middle peasants. These three types of middle peasants are the same class, and they have the same political treatment, but their economic treatment is different. Lower-middle peasants are given a small share of the fruits in the distribution of fruits, because their land and tools are similar to those of middle peasants, but sometimes the grain produced by their land is not enough to sustain them for a year. They also have to sell a small amount of labor (no more than half a month or twenty days a year). Most of the time, they are engaged in production on their own land. In good years, they have enough to eat, and their life is a little better than that of the middle peasants in the countryside, and much better than that of the poor peasants. This is the lower-middle peasant. If a household has land and tools comparable to those of a middle peasant according to the documents, but the family is slightly poorer due to natural disasters or man-made disasters, what should we do? Upper-middle peasants are wealthy middle peasants in the countryside. It is not to elevate the status of middle peasants. The masses also agree with this, because sometimes calling them wealthy middle peasants is considered to be calling them rich peasants, so wealthy middle peasants are called upper-middle peasants. There is no difference in principle, it is just a different way of calling them.

    Ruzuo Work Team, Yongnian Second District, Li An

Li An Comrade:

    Your spirit of studying policies and raising questions in your work is good, but judging from the questions you have raised, you have not correctly grasped the spirit of the policies, and your attitude in implementing the policies is not serious enough. Now, I will answer your questions separately as follows:

    1. Regarding the issue of uniting with middle peasants, you should carefully understand our party's middle peasant policy from the recent many documents and instructions. The principle of compensating middle peasants who have been wrongly labeled is very definite and clear. You said that you encountered resistance from the masses when implementing it, and as a result, you compensated the wrongly labeled middle peasants who had no "roughness" first, and dealt with those who had "roughness" later. This is completely wrong. In the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taihang District Party Committee, the phenomenon of resisting correction by using the excuse of fighting not middle peasants, but puppet soldiers, local bullies, and special agents was criticized, indicating that it was wrong to fight them on these charges, and all of them should be corrected and apologized, and their land and property should be compensated immediately and unconditionally. Therefore, it is wrong for your work team to leave those with "roughness" aside for later, using the excuse that the masses are unwilling. You said that you would leave them for later, but the fruits are still in the farmers' association and have not been distributed, and are currently being filled. If they are not returned or compensated at this time, it will be even more impossible to solve them in the future, so doing so is actually not preparing to compensate these wrongly labeled households! It is to continue to adhere to the past mistakes. You said that the masses are not thinking straight, but in reality, the leadership of the work team is weak and powerless, and has committed the error of tailism. The Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee said that this kind of resistance to correction under the pretext of the masses not thinking straight is "adhering to 'leftist' adventurism, which is the ideology of anarchism." I hope you will have enough understanding of this point. In your work, you must resolutely implement whatever is stipulated in the policies, and break down any obstacles. You must not mess around with anything that is not allowed by the policies. According to the following situation, as long as the work team adheres to the policies in implementing the party's policies, the masses can be completely persuaded to agree (we have fully proven this point in several reports on Wu'an Ninth District). Your work team should adhere to the policies and implement leadership, and middle peasants who have been wrongly labeled, regardless of whether they have "roughness" or not, should be compensated and returned immediately and unconditionally. At the same time, it must also be recognized that the more wrongly labeled households there are, the greater the damage to the people and the party, and the faster they should be compensated or returned. Doing so is not to become separated from the masses, but the concrete implementation of the correct and complete mass line.

    2. You have a misunderstanding about the Central Bureau's instructions to Taiyue to immediately unseal the houses and property of landlords and rich peasants. There is no land reform in Taiyue District at present, and landlords who have been swept out of their homes must be resettled immediately. If they are not resettled, people will starve to death, so their property must be unsealed so that they can survive and engage in production. As for giving them a share as stipulated in the Land Law Outline, how to give it and what to give must be determined in the filling, which does not conflict with the provisions of the Land Law Outline. You said that landlords who have been swept out of their homes in your work area all have a quilt and some simple furniture, and it is enough to give them a house, which is not correct. In the place where the filling is being carried out, we should insist on giving the landlords a share, otherwise it is still a "leftist" error. Here, you seem to have no understanding of the error of sweeping them out of their homes. As for the issue of hidden wealth, the instructions said very clearly: if it is known for sure that they have hidden wealth, they can be ordered to hand it over according to the Land Law Outline. If they do not hand it over, people can be sent to dig it out together with them. If it cannot be dug out, then it cannot be determined that they really have it, which is a trumped-up charge, and should not be sealed for a long time.

    3. The so-called protection of industry and commerce includes the sideline businesses of landlords, such as their handicraft tools and small workshops in rural areas (because these do not belong to feudal exploitation). Therefore, the oil mill of the landlord you mentioned should not be confiscated. If it has already been confiscated, it should be returned immediately and unconditionally according to the Central Bureau's instructions on industry and commerce, and allowed to continue operating.

    4. Regarding the issue of whether the middle peasant class should be further divided into upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle in the classification of classes, we believe that it should never be done. We must act according to the class classification documents. Chairman Mao's report said very clearly about the situation of middle peasants in the filling: part of the land remains unchanged, part of the land is increased, and only a part of the wealthy middle peasants can take out a small amount of surplus land with their consent. The upper-middle peasants are classified here to distinguish middle peasants from rich peasants and to prevent middle peasants with slight exploitation from being classified as rich peasants. The purpose is to protect middle peasants. The classification method of upper, middle, and lower that you mentioned has the danger of harming the interests of middle peasants. At the same time, the absence of lower-middle peasants does not prevent the poorer middle peasants from being given land and fruits in the filling. The documents do not stipulate that middle peasants should not be given fruits and land. Chairman Mao's report also pointed out that the needs of middle peasants should be paid attention to when distributing the land and property of the feudal classes. You said that there must be lower-middle peasants when distributing fruits, which is also incorrect. I hope you will act according to the policies and not create other names outside the policies, which will lead to errors.

    If you disagree with the reply, please raise it for discussion.　　　　　Editor

### 为补偿中农问题答黎暗同志

专栏：编读往来

　　为补偿中农问题答黎暗同志编者同志：
    中央局指示太岳区党委端正政策纠正左倾冒险主义，我看后有弄不清的地方，特提出商讨，请有时间作一答复：一、团结中农问题，我非常赞成，在最近做土改工作中也是在切实执行。雇贫对于团结中农认识到了，但对订正错斗中农成份，退还农会现存错斗中农的果实问题，在村干和雇贫中是个问题。在村中错斗中农少的户也好打通；在错斗中农多的地方就不易打通。如永年二区茹佐组在郑家营订正了五户错斗中农成份，在开始群众也很满意，但提到退农会存他的一辆大车时，大家就反映意见，不同意退。根据最近中央划阶级的精神又研究了一次才没意见。而在小龙马这个问题就难做。据昨天汇报：全村被错斗中农有三十户左右，没有一点毛病增资倒佃的新中农八户，其余都是有的和汉奸有点关系，有的身上有“糙气”（毛病），现在农会保存的东西大部是这些户的，而这些人都是扫地出门，我们在村干小组会上提出这个问题做研究，他们说斗了就算了吧！要把农会的东西给错斗中农还不够他的呢，他们的坑最大。在我们说服动员之后，于二十三晚上订正了十七户，在二十四日召开会，大家就不来了，村干小组长说：“都改正了，要退东西，没咱的啦，开会没劲。”当然知道这是农民的单纯经济观点落后思想。但在被斗户多的村庄，在雇贫中这一问题是难打通。我们只能正确的引导或讲中农政策，我们不能强迫群众退还果实，在小龙马现在如把错斗中农的东西完全退回，是脱离雇贫的。故现在决定先退身上没糙气中农的东西，有糙气的错斗中农以后再说。这算不算迁就雇贫的落后思想？如果不这样做都不来开会怎么办？对于错斗中农多的村庄怎办？当然，应当掌握中农政策，怎样才能使雇贫也不脱离我们而又把中农的果实退还了。
    二、“对（第二条）地主富农房子应一律立即启封………”我个人考虑了很长时间，思想上总认为不合适。对于地主，根据土地法上是农会接受地主一切东西，再分给他一份，我认为给地主的一份不一定是原来的房屋土地和家具，把村中其他的分给他一份也是一样的。现在给他立即启封是不是让他住原房？如果不让他住原房，根据村中人口和房屋分配该他在那里就在那里，启封不启封有啥关系。（我根据我的工作区谈的，地主在扫地出门时每人有被子一条，锅碗盆勺和简单的家具）也许我思想上有毛病。对内财的问题，说要他交出，或派人协同本人挖出，这样如果他说没有就没有，那个地主也不会说有。还得根据群众街坊邻居的研究，我认为中央局的指示在经过复查的与群众发动有基础的区域可以施行，如果群众发动没有基础，雇贫对地主的阶级仇恨不和老区一样，这样做容易模糊群众的阶级意识。
    三、“对工商业（包括地富城乡工商业在内）坚决保护不得侵犯……”地富在乡村中的油坊、粉坊算是副业还算是商业？有一家是地主有雇工，但在民国二十九年又开一油坊，油坊一年打九个月油，牲口雇工不种地时油坊完全使用，油坊打的油饼也当肥料上地，家中人也零化卖油赚的钱。而地里种花的花籽也当打油材料，这些打油人都是吃的家中打的粮食，管帐的就是地主本人。这倒底算是家庭副业还算商业？我们研究有两个意见，说他和家庭的封建剥削是分不开的，算家庭副业，应没收（已没收了）。有的说是供给其他人吃的，是把原料变成物品供给社会使用，算是农村作坊，不应没收。这两种意见究竟那种对？那么如属商业还得退还地主？农民现在也用他打油，对社会是一样的有利，怎办？
    人民日报四月二十三日第一版，讨论与研究的后边，编者按：“白错划阶级有‘上中农、下中农’字样这是错误的……。”
    在乡村划阶级的等级是有上中农和中中、下中的区别，这三种中农是同一阶级，在政治待遇上是一样的，而在经济待遇上不一样，下中农在分果实中都分到少部果实，因为他土地工具和中农差不多，但有时其土地打粮不够维持一年生活。还要出卖很少一些劳力（一年也不过半月二十天），大部时间是在自己地中生产，好年头就够吃，和乡下说中农的时光稍空一些，而比贫农强的多，就是下中农，这是分果实时的名词。如果只按文件有的户土地工具相当中农，而家中因天灾人祸弄的稍空一些怎办？上中农在农村中就是富裕中农，并不是把中农成份提高，群众在这点上也是同意的，因为有时说富裕中农就给说成富农了，所以叫富裕中农为上中农，这没有原则上的区别，只是叫法的不同。
    永年二区茹佐工作组　黎暗黎暗同志：
    你们在工作中研究政策提出问题的精神是好的，但就你所提出的几个问题看，对政策的精神还没有正确掌握，执行政策的态度也还不够严肃，现就所提问题分别答复如下：
    一、团结中农问题，你们应该再从最近许多文件指示中细心体会我党中农政策。错斗了的中农必须补偿，这一原则是十分肯定明确的。你说执行起来遭到群众抵抗，结果你们就分步骤的先补偿没“糙气”的错斗中农，有“糙气”的以后再说，这样做是完全错误的。中央局给太行区党委的指示里，对各地以不是斗中农，而是斗伪军分子、恶霸分子、特务分子为借口抵抗纠偏的现象给以批评，说明以这些罪名斗争是错误的，应一律改正道歉，其土地财产应立即无条件的补偿。因之，你们工作组以群众不愿意为借口，把有“糙气”的丢下以后再说是不对的，你们说留下以后再说，但目前果实尚在农会未分，又正在进行填补，这时还不退还补偿，以后将更无法解决，所以这样做实际上就是不准备补偿这些错斗户！就是继续坚持过去错误。你们说是群众思想不通，实际上是工作组领导软弱无力，犯了尾巴主义错误。中央局给太岳区党委指示中，说这种借口群众思想不通抵抗纠偏是“坚持左倾冒险主义，就是无政府主义思想”。希望你们对于这点作足够认识，在工作中凡是政策上规定的一定要坚决执行，有障碍要打破，政策上不许做的就一点也不要乱动。根据下面情况，在执行党的政策上，只要工作组坚持政策，群众是完全可以说服同意的（这一点我们在关于武安九区的若干报导中已经充分证明了的）。你们工作组应该坚持政策贯彻领导，错斗了的中农不管有没有“糙气”，应立即一律无条件的该补的补该退的退。同时还须认识，越是错斗户多的地方，因为错斗越多，对人民对党的损害越大，越应赶快补偿或退还。这样做并不是脱离群众，而是正确的完整的群众路线的具体执行。
    二、对中央局指示太岳立即启封地主富农房屋财产问题，你了解有错误，太岳区目前没有进行土改，而扫地出门的地主必须立即安置，不安置就要饿死人，所以要给他们启封财产，使他们能活下去，并且能进行生产。至于土地法大纲规定的给他们一份，怎样给，给什么，必须在填补中才能确定，这和土地法大纲的规定并不冲突，你说你们工作地区扫地出门的地主都有一条被子和一些简单家具，只要分给他们房子就可以了，这是不对的，在进行填补的地方应坚持给地主一份，否则仍是左倾错误，这里你似乎对扫地出门的错误是没有认识的。至于内财问题，指示中说的很清楚：若确知其有内产，可根据土地法大纲令其交出，不交者可派人并协同其本人挖出，如果挖不出，就不能断定其真有，就是莫须有，就不应长期封闭。
    三、所谓保护工商业，就包括地主的副业如他们的手工业工具和农村里的小作坊（因为这些不属于封建剥削）。因之，你提的那户地主的油坊是不应没收的，已经没收了，就应该按中央局关于工商业指示规定，立即无条件退还，并使其继续营业。
    四、关于划阶级中，中农阶层中是否应再分为上中、中中、下中问题，我们认为绝不应该，一定要按划阶级文件去做。毛主席报告中对于填补中的中农情况，说得很清楚：一部分土地不变，一部分增加土地，只有一部分富裕中农，有少数多余土地在他们自愿情况下方可拿出。这里划上富裕中农，是为了区别中农与富农，怕把有轻微剥削的中农划入富农，目的是为了保护中农。你所提的上、中、下的划法则有损害中农利益的危险。同时没有下中农也并不妨碍在填补中给较贫苦的中农分土地果实，文件上并没规定是中农就不分果实土地，在毛主席报告中还指出在分配封建阶级的土地财产时应当注意中农的需要，你说分果实时要有下中农也是不对的。希望你们按照政策办事，不要在政策之外另立名目，招致错误。
    对答复有不同意的地方仍望提出讨论。　　　　　编者
