[Report from the Jinlu豫 (Ji Lu Yu) Area on the 3rd of this month] The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has created deep suffering for the people in the areas they have reached on the south bank of the Yellow River, through looting, burning, and killing. On March 22nd, the Chiang bandits conducted "mopping-up" operations in the areas south of the Yellow River to arrest men for conscription and to loot. In the ten-odd villages of Sanguanmiao, Guolüe, Renzhuang, and Mengguj, the Chiang bandits shot and killed twenty-six farmers. Zhang Zuoren of Mengguj was not spared, and all four members of his family were killed. Zhang Zuoren and his wife were shot by the Chiang bandits, and their two children were thrown to their deaths alive. The Chiang bandits boldly seized men for conscription. On the 25th, when the market was held in Macun, the 84th Division of the Chiang bandits surrounded the market and seized 1,400 young and middle-aged people who had come to the market. Two civilians asked the Chiang bandits to release them, but the enemy demanded 220 silver dollars from them. Just as they were released, an enemy sentry shouted "They're running away!" and opened fire. As a result, one person was killed, and the other was captured again. The Chiang bandits stole more than 1,000 large carts of grain in the Nanwangpo South area within seven days. An investigation into the lives of several families in Manzhuang Village, Jinxiang, reveals the severe disaster suffered by the people of Henan due to the enemy's looting. Man Yangfeng's family of four in Manzhuang has four mu of land. Last year, they paid the enemy an assessment equivalent to 80 jin of grain per mu. This February, he made some money by selling bean cakes, and hid two sheng of sorghum in a cabinet, but it was also stolen by the Chiang bandits stationed in Yangshan. Now, the whole family of four eats only two meals a day of wheat seedlings boiled in plain water. A 70-year-old Mrs. Man, who lives in Dongtou Temple, goes out to beg for food every day and can only get vegetable nests or cotton seed nests mixed with bean cakes and wheat seedlings. A few days ago, her daughter gave her one jin and one liang of cotton thread, asking her to make a single layer of clothing. One day, she went out to beg for food, and the thread at home was taken away by the Chiang bandits. She had saved twelve eggs for a long time, planning to sell them to buy some sorghum to eat, but fearing that the Chiang Kai-shek army would steal them again, she hid them in a pile of firewood, but they were finally stolen by the Chiang bandits, which made the old lady half dead with anger. Man Yunzeng is 71 years old, with two people in his family and 1.8 mu of land. He was allocated two mu of land in 1946. The grain he harvested last year was completely requisitioned by the enemy, and he maintains his life with sweet potato leaves and other vegetables. Recently, the Chiang bandits collected one silver dollar per mu and stole three jin of cotton from his old pit field. Man Shouyi's family of four has three mu of land. In previous years, he mainly made a living by hammering stones to make grinding stones, but now he cannot do business due to the disturbances of the Chiang bandits. The whole family is now eating cotton seeds and leaves. They planted half a mu of green onions and a few fen of garlic seedlings, but the Chiang bandits ate them all without giving a penny.

　　黄河南岸蒋灾严重
  　老百姓吃麦苗棉籽
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】蒋家匪帮在黄河南岸，所到地区抢掠烧杀造成了人民的深重灾难，三月二十二日，蒋匪在南岸地区清剿抓丁抢掠，仅三官庙、郭掠、任庄、孟姑集等十余村庄，被蒋匪枪杀的农民即有二十六名，孟姑集的张作仁全家四口均未幸免，张作仁与其妻被蒋匪枪杀，其两个孩子被蒋匪活摔死。蒋匪大胆抓丁，二十五日马村逢集时，蒋匪八十四师即将该集包围抓去赶集的青壮年一千四百余人，其中两个老百姓要求蒋匪释放，但敌人向他们索取了二百二十元银洋，刚刚释放，敌人哨兵又喊“跑差了”，即开枪射击，结果两个人一个被打死，一个又被捉回。蒋匪在南旺坡南地区于七天内抢走粮食千余大车。根据在金乡满庄村对几户群众生活的调查，即可知道河南群众因敌人的抢掠而所遭受的严重灾难，满庄满仰风四口人，四亩地，去年给敌人出负担每亩地合粮食八十斤，今年二月间他推豆饼赚了二升高粱藏在柜里，也被住羊山的蒋匪抢了去，现在全家四口人每天只吃两顿白水煮麦苗。住在东头庙里的一位七十岁的满老太太，每天出去讨饭，只能要到点豆饼掺麦苗的菜窝窝或棉籽窝窝。前几天她闺女给了她一斤一两棉线子，叫她弄件单衣裳，一天她出去要饭，家里的线子被蒋匪拿走了，她长时间存下了十二个鸡子准备卖了买点高粱吃，恐怕蒋匪军再抢走而把它藏在柴火堆里，但终于又被蒋匪抢走了，把老太太气了个半死。满云增七十一岁了，家有两口人，一亩八分地，一九四六年分到了二亩地。去年所打粮食被敌人征收完了，他以红薯叶子等菜维持生活，最近蒋匪又每亩地征收去了一块银洋，抢走了他老坑地里所收的三斤棉花。满守义四口人，三亩地，往年主要靠他打石头做磨为生，现因蒋匪的扰乱买卖不能做了，全家现在吃的是棉花种和树叶子，栽了半亩葱和几分蒜苗子，蒋匪给全部吃光没给一个钱。
