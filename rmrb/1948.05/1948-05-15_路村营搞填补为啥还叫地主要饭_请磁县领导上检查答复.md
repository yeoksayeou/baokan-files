    Lucunying's Filling Gaps Campaign: Why are Landlords Being Forced to Beg?
    Please, Leaders of Ci County, Investigate and Reply

    To the Editors:

    We are unclear on two issues and request clarification:

    1.  We have seen in the newspaper that landlords and rich peasants who were swept out the door are to be provided with means of production and livelihood. However, we have heard that in Lucunying Village, in the Seventh District of Ci County, during the gap-filling work, all the landlords were confiscated and then ordered to beg for food. Does this not contradict the provision of means of production and livelihood? Please reply to clarify!

    2.  Furthermore, cadres in Houlibing Village, in the Seventh District of Ci County, privately arrested a landlord and took him to their home. They severely beat the landlord to extort valuables. Is this in accordance with the Land Law Outline? Does it violate the instruction against using corporal punishment? Please reply.

    路村营搞填补为啥还叫地主要饭
    请磁县领导上检查答复编辑同志：
    现在有两个问题不明确请指示：
    一、看到报纸上有照顾扫地出门地主、富农生产资料和生活资料，现在确实听到磁县七区路村营村做填补工作，把地主全部没收后，令其要饭，这不是没照顾生产资料和生活资料吗？究竟是否对，请答复为荷！
    二、又有磁县七区后李兵庄村干部，私行将地主捉获到他家，将地主重打要内物，这是不是合乎土地法大纲？合乎不许用肉刑的指示？请答复。
