　　Nanciying Corrects Infringements Against Middle Peasants;
　　All Thousand Acres of Spring Land Planted
　　[Taiyue News] Nanciying in the Fourth District of Yangcheng is united in production, and more than 1,600 mu of spring land has been completely planted. Since the correction of the pro-poor, anti-middle peasant deviation, the entire village has shown great enthusiasm for production. When the middle peasant Yan Guanzhang's mutual aid group was planting millet, they voluntarily formed a "night work team." In addition to working during the day, they also raced against time at night, plowing more than one mu of land in four dark nights. Women and children also went to the fields to hoe wheat. Currently, all 1,230+ mu of millet, 370+ mu of cotton, hemp, sesame and other miscellaneous crops in the village have been planted. Women and children alone have hoed eighty or ninety mu of wheat. Some have even rebuilt the long-neglected field dikes to expand the cultivated area. The village production committee also plans to leave some people at home to take care of the fields after planting, and to send others to engage in short-term transportation to solve everyone's need for salt and other necessities. Some women have already gathered wild vegetables to survive the famine. For example, poor peasant woman Yan Xiaosan leads her entire group to collect poplar leaves and dig up wild vegetables every morning and evening, mixing them into their meals.

　　南次营纠正侵害中农后
  　千余亩春地全部下种
    【太岳消息】阳城四区南次营团结生产，一千六百多亩春地已完全种上。自从伤害中农偏向纠正后，全村生产劲头高。中农燕官章互助组在种谷的时候，自愿结合了一个“夜干班”，除了白天做活外，夜里还要抢时间干，四个黑夜就翻了一亩多地。妇女儿童也都上地锄麦。现全村一千二百三十多亩谷，三百七十多亩棉花，大麻芝麻等杂田，已全部种起，麦子光靠妇女儿童，就锄了八九十亩。有的还把多年不修的地堰也垒起来，扩大耕地面积。村里生产委员会，也计划种完了就留一部分人在家照顾地里，抽出人去搞短期运输，解决大家吃盐和其他的需要。有些妇女已采野菜渡荒。如贫农妇女燕小三，每天早晚领导全组人搞杨叶挖野菜，配在饭里吃。
