　　Local Armed Forces in Northern Henan Ambush on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway
　　Annihilating 200 Chiang Kai-shek Bandits in Two Days
　　[Report from this newspaper] The local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Taihang Region annihilated over two hundred Chiang Kai-shek bandits in two days on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. On April 15th and 16th, our sub-district's armed backbone troops set up an ambush on the railway between Daiwang and Qianzhuang. On the first day, the assault battalion of the enemy’s 40th Division from Jiaozuo and part of the 318th Regiment were escorting the families and property of the Chiang Kai-shek 40th Division to Xinxiang. They entered our ambush circle and suffered casualties from our short, intensive fire. The enemy fled in disarray into the Daiwang stronghold. The enemy’s rearguard retreated back to Jiaozuo,不敢续进, killing and wounding over fifty enemy soldiers, capturing one alive, capturing four puppet soldiers’ family members, and seizing three mules and horses, fifty-eight rifles, over two thousand rounds of ammunition, two bicycles, 1.25 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency and customs gold certificates, and two carts fully loaded with property. At six o'clock in the morning on the 16th, the enemy, with its main force of two battalions of the 318th Regiment and over four hundred men from the assault battalion, along with a part of the puppet bandit Wang Delin's forces, tried to flee eastward under cover. The enemy attempted to occupy the Qianzhuang coal accumulation high ground. Our × Regiment had already deployed its firepower and gave the enemy a head-on blow, killing over one hundred and fifty enemy soldiers including a company commander and below. The enemy abandoned over fifty corpses, captured nine alive, and seized ten rifles, ten bayonets, one American-style machine gun, one rifle grenade launcher, and over two thousand rounds of ammunition. The enemy stronghold in Qianzhuang has been completely destroyed. These two battles excited the masses in the enemy-occupied areas. The people of Baijianfang brought us soup and water, saying with smiles to our soldiers: "We've been hoping you'd come for a long time! The damned '遭殃军' [soldiers of misfortune] have made us suffer so much, robbing us of everything and not even letting us speak. I think if you keep fighting like this a few more times, we won't have to worry about wiping them out and getting some relief for us old folks!"
