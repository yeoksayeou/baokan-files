　　The First Corps of the North China Field Army Announces:
  　25,000 Enemies Annihilated in the Linfen Campaign
    [Report from the Jinnan Front, this newspaper, 21st] The Headquarters of the First Corps of the North China Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued its Operational Communiqué No. 1 on May 21st, stating:
    A portion of the First Corps of the North China Field Army, in coordination with the Jin Sui and Taiyue Military Region troops, launched a powerful offensive against the strongly fortified stronghold of Linfen held by the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops on March 7th, in order to eliminate the remaining strongholds in the inner lines, completely liberate southern Shanxi, and coordinate with the Northwest and Yu-Shaan-E (Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei) People's Liberation Army operations. Initially, a portion of our forces cleared the outer enemy local armed forces in the Linfen and Xiangling areas west of the Fen River. Another portion simultaneously attacked and occupied the enemy's forward positions from the north and south of the city, and raided and seized the airfield south of the city, destroying two transport planes of their airlifted troops, completely thwarting the enemy's plan to airlift the 30th Brigade to reinforce the Northwest. Subsequently, the main force attacked and captured Dongguan (the commercial center of Linfen, with an independent defense system). On April 10th, after breaking through three layers of enemy defenses on the periphery of Dongguan and capturing important strongholds such as the railway station and the power plant, we launched a general offensive against the enemy in Dongguan, immediately annihilating the main force of Yan Xishan’s 66th Division, and the campaign immediately entered a decisive stage. We then concentrated our main force to attack the city from the east, south, and north simultaneously. The enemy, utilizing their long-term reinforced bunker complexes, concrete fortifications, underground works, and moats and fortified pillboxes outside the city, constructed four lines of defense, and under the cover of day and night bombing by light and heavy bombers, resisted desperately. After more than twenty days of fighting, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, with entire companies and battalions being annihilated by us. We finally cleared all obstacles to scaling the city walls before May 17th. At dusk on the 17th, under the support of intense artillery fire and close coordination between infantry, artillery, and engineer units, we launched a general offensive, breaking into the city in just one minute. The enemy still attempted to concentrate their forces and stubbornly resist using the moats and bunkers inside the city, but they were all smashed by our assault troops. The battle ended completely at 24:00 on the 17th, and the entire city of Linfen was occupied by us. According to preliminary statistics, in this campaign, we annihilated the headquarters of the 30th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek’s 30th Division and its 88th Regiment, 90th Regiment, and Replacement Regiment; the headquarters of Yan Xishan’s 66th Division and its 196th Regiment, 197th Regiment, and 198th Regiment; the headquarters of Yan Xishan’s Southern Shanxi Local Armed Forces Command and its Training Regiment 1, Training Regiment 2, Security Regiment 15, Security Regiment 24, Security Regiment 25, Security Regiment 26, Security Regiment 27, and Security Regiment 29; the Southern Shanxi Military District Command, the Linfen Area People's Armed Self-Defense Corps, the Kuomintang 38th Army (i.e., 1st Army) garrison office, the 5th Sub-Supervision Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters Station, and the 7th Station, 212th Station, Linfen Air Station, the People's Service Brigade of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, Yan Xishan’s 5th, 6th, 9th, and 12th puppet Commissioner's Offices, and the puppet county governments of Linfen, Fushan, Xiangling, Fencheng, Wanquan, Gaoping, Yangcheng, Qingshui, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Daning, Xinjiang, Anze, and Yonghe, totaling more than 25,000 people. Among them, 23,495 people (including wounded prisoners) were captured, including Liang Peihuang, the lieutenant general deputy commander-in-chief of Yan Xishan’s 7th Army and commander-in-chief of the southern Shanxi local armed forces, and the highest commander of the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit army in Linfen. Five aircraft were destroyed or shot down, and the following were captured: two howitzers, twelve mountain guns, four anti-tank guns, eight 120mm mortars, fifty-nine 82mm mortars, three hundred and ninety-one small cannons, fourteen anti-tank rifles, one rocket launcher, one hundred and four heavy machine guns, one thousand and twenty-three light machine guns, two hundred and eighteen submachine guns, seven thousand four hundred and eighty-one rifles and carbines, more than one million six hundred thousand rounds of ammunition of various types, more than one thousand four hundred rounds of artillery shells of various types, more than four thousand catties of yellow explosives, four radio telephones, twenty-seven radio stations, two hundred and fifty-seven telephones, nine locomotives, one hundred and twenty-six cars, one hundred and fifty-four automobiles, six hundred and sixteen mules and horses, more than 8 billion in puppet currency, more than thirteen thousand parachutes, one ordnance repair shop and one bomb factory each, and many other war trophies.
