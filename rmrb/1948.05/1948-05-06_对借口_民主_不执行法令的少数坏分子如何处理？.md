　　To the Editor:
    During the democratic replenishment movement, the tax collection work in the Second District of Xingtai was affected due to a misunderstanding of democracy. The county assigned agricultural income tax, and because the funds were urgently needed, the district convened a meeting of village chiefs, treasurers, and poor peasant/farm laborer group leaders from each village. They stipulated that villages should allocate the tax to households, using methods of reduction and exemption (reducing or exempting individual disaster-stricken households), with a deadline of ten days for completion. However, only three or two villages completed it by the deadline, and most villages did not pay. Because the funds were urgently needed, a second round of urging was issued, but still to no effect. Out of a total of sixty-four villages in the district, only forty-eight villages were completed after a month of collection. Sixteen villages remained uncompleted (including two villages that paid nothing). The reason was that village cadres dared not act, and the masses said, "It's a democracy, what can they do if they don't give it to him (referring to the cadres)?" Later, a meeting of village cadres who owed money was held to specifically study why the task was not completed. Some said, "It's a democracy, what can we do if the people don't give it?" Others said, "We are fighting against the cadres!" They were all sighing. Explanations were made targeting these thoughts, and finally, it was proposed that tax collection is a task that must be rationally assigned, but whoever is assigned how much must pay that much. If individual bad elements are causing trouble, they can be sent to the district for processing. The next day, a problem was discovered: Chen ×× from Sujiatun Village said at a meeting, "Villages outside haven't paid yet, and our village is being urged so urgently..." etc. He also secretly organized a group of people to resist paying. I took this person to the district and detained him, and talked to the district party secretary about the matter. He said: "Ours is a democratic government, we can't detain people," and released the person. Can a democratic government detain people? Should this kind of person be detained or not? (Wu Zhengang, Finance and Grain Section, Xingtai County) Comrade Wu Zhengang:
    In the past, rural areas lacked democracy for a long time, and the masses dared not speak their minds. Therefore, the main issue in rural areas today is how to mobilize the masses and establish a democratic life. In the process of promoting democracy, extreme democratic tendencies may naturally arise. Leaders should guide and educate the masses to correct these tendencies, and selfish and self-serving individuals should be criticized and exposed. However, the issue raised in the letter does not fall within the scope of democracy. Paying taxes is the obligation of every citizen, and no one can defy government laws, paying only if they want to, and not paying if they don't. In the collection process, the masses can be allowed to offer opinions and discuss how to collect, but it is not permissible to refuse to pay taxes and disobey government laws. Staff should be clear about this. Misunderstandings about democracy can be explained. If there are indeed those who resist paying taxes, they can be handled in accordance with government laws, forcing them to comply.
    In addition, the letter mentioned that when distributing the tax to the villages, the district convened a meeting of village chiefs, treasurers, and poor peasant/farm laborer group leaders from each village. This practice is also incorrect. In areas where land reform is not being carried out, all poor peasant organizations should immediately cease their activities. In areas where land reform is being carried out, the collection of public grain is also the responsibility of the village chief and financial and grain cadres. During the process, the opinions of poor peasant organizations can be respected, but there must be no confusion between government and the people, or blurring of the lines between various organizations.

### 对借口“民主”不执行法令的少数坏分子如何处理？

　　对借口“民主”不执行法令的少数坏分子如何处理？编辑同志：
    在民主抽补运动中，因错误了解民主，邢台二区的征收工作受到影响。县派农业所得税款，因用款急，往村分派时，区召开各村村长、财政、贫雇组长会议，规定村往户派，用减免和增加办法（减免个别灾户），限期十天完成。到期却只有三两个村完成，大部村庄未缴。因急用，就下了二次督促，仍无效果。全区共六十四个村，征收了一个月，才完成四十八个村。还有十六个村未完成（内有两村分文未交）。原因是村干部不敢干，群众说民主哩，不给他能怎样（指干部）？后又开了个欠款村干部会议，专门研究为啥完不成？有的说：“实行民主的，伢不出咱能怎样？”有的说：“斗干部哩！”都是叹气。针对这些思想作了解释，最后提出征款是任务分派要合理，但派谁多少就得多少，如有个别坏分子捣乱，可送区处理。第二天就发现了一个问题：有苏家屯村陈××，在大会上说：伢外村都还未交哩，咱村就督促真急……等。暗地还组织了一部分人抗款不出。我就把该人弄到区里扣起了，给区分书谈了谈此事，他说：咱是民主政府，不能扣人，就此将该人放了。民主政府能扣人否？象这种人该扣不该扣？（邢台县财粮科、武振纲）武振纲同志：
    过去农村中长时间缺乏民主，群众不敢讲理，因之今天农村里主要问题是怎样发动群众，建立民主生活。在发扬民主过程中，自然也可能产生极端民主的偏向，对这偏向领导上应诱导教育群众纠正偏向，对少数自私自利的尖头应当批评揭露。但如来信所提出问题，则不属于民主范围，交纳粮款是每个公民的义务，任何人不能违抗政府法令，想出就出，不想出就不出。在征收过程中可以允许群众提出意见，讨论怎样征收，但不是允许可以不交粮款不服从政府法令，这一点工作人员应该弄清楚。对民主误解的可给予解释，若确有抗款不出的，则可按照政府法令办事，强制其执行。
    另外，来信中提到往村分派时，区召开各村长、财政及贫雇组长开会，这作法也是不对的，不进行填补的地方一切贫雇组织应即停止活动。进行填补的地方，征收公粮也是村长及财粮干部的职责，在进行中可以尊重贫雇组织意见，但绝不可政民不分，使各种组织混淆不清。
