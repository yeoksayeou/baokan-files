Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, the 12th Brigade and 48th Brigade of the 17th Division, were in extreme disarray and panic when they fled Yan'an. On the 20th, at 9 p.m., the enemy issued an order to prepare for escape within four hours. After 10 p.m., the city was in chaos. The enemy set fires everywhere, looting wantonly, and many businesses were emptied. The enemy's ammunition depots and warehouses in the old city and elsewhere were not destroyed in time. Many ammunition depots inside the mountain fortifications were also left untouched as they fled in disarray. Under the pursuit of our besieging troops, the enemy soldiers rolled into a chaotic mess, abandoning guns and ammunition along the way. By the time they reached Thirty Mile Shop, they had discarded their artillery. As soon as the enemy left the urban area, the youth of the southern district voluntarily extinguished the enemy's abandoned, still-burning warehouses, rescued materials, and maintained order in the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to reports in Shanghai newspapers, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities in Xi'an, terrified by the offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, have intensified their fascist control since late March. They stipulated that a system of mutual guarantee and joint liability be implemented throughout the city, with each household head providing a written guarantee that would be posted on their door. Identity cards were also completely reissued, with a photograph required to be attached. It is now said to cost 60,000 yuan to take a one-inch photo in Xi'an, making the total burden for the city over 30 billion yuan. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits also forced young adults in the city, from eighteen to forty-five years old, to undergo military training in three phases, even students and faculty were not exempt. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits also attempted to deceive unemployed and out-of-school youth into serving as cannon fodder in the civil war. The "Youth Army" recruiting station in Xi'an began its third "recruitment" this January, reportedly aiming to recruit 2,000 people, but the youth of Xi'an, knowing that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' counter-revolutionary rule is nearing its end, refused to be fooled. To date, fewer than one hundred have "enlisted." Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are intensifying their extortion of Xi'an citizens to supply their counter-revolutionary civil war consumption. In addition to the 150 billion yuan "Special Relief Donation," the people are constantly burdened with round after round of settlement fees for conscripted soldiers. Recently, there has also been a "Suppress Rebellion and Build the Nation Fee," totaling 300 billion yuan, with the first phase being 210 billion yuan. The assignments are tight and fierce, with even small shops having to pay several million yuan; residents also have to contribute. Currently, many citizens are refusing to pay this new levy.

　　延安逃敌狼狈相
  　西安匪恐慌加紧法西斯管制
    【新华社西北三日电】蒋胡匪军十七师十二旅、四十八旅自延安逃跑时，极为狼狈慌乱。二十日晚九时匪即发出四小时内准备逃跑的命令，十时后市内大乱，敌到处纵火焚烧，大肆抢掠，许多商家被劫一空。敌在旧城等处军火库、仓库则来不及破坏，山上工事内许多弹药库亦原封未动，即狼狈逃窜。在我围城部队跟踪追击下，敌兵慌马乱滚作一团，沿途枪炮弹药遗弃满地。到三十里铺时，即将大炮丢弃。敌刚出市区，南区青年即自动将敌遗弃尚在燃烧之仓库扑灭，抢救物资，并维持该市秩序。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据沪报载：西安蒋匪当局慑于西北人民解放军之进攻，自三月下旬起加紧其法西斯管制，规定在全市实行三户联保连坐，由各户家长互具切结，将切结贴在门口，身份证亦一律重换，并规定附贴一相片。现西安照一寸相片一张六万元，全市此项负担即达三百余亿元。蒋匪并强迫全市自十八岁至四十五岁之青壮年分作三期受军训，连学生教职员也不例外。蒋匪并图欺骗失学失业之青年充当内战炮灰，设在西安的“青年军”招收站已从今年一月份开始第三次“招募”，据说要招募两千名，但西安青年深知蒋匪反革命统治即将死亡，拒绝上钩，至今应“招”者不满百人。又讯：蒋匪正加紧勒索西安市民，供应其反革命内战消耗。除一千五百亿的“救济特捐”外，老百姓经常负担一期又一期的壮丁安家费，最近又有“戡乱建国费”，总额三千亿元，第一期二千一百亿元，派得紧派得凶，一家小铺面动辄几百万元；住户也要出款。现市民对此项新的摊派多拒绝交纳。
