　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Washington dispatch: American working people are actively preparing to commemorate May Day. "May Day Committees" and similar organizations have been established in New York and other places. The "New York May Day Committee" held a meeting a few days ago, attended by 1,000 representatives from 60 labor unions and other labor groups. The meeting established plans for May Day parades and demonstrations; and decided that the parades and demonstrations would be conducted under slogans such as opposing warmongers and conscription, strengthening the United Nations, and protecting workers from anti-labor laws. The New York May Day Committee printed 100,000 copies of the booklet "Struggling for Peace in 1948" and 1.5 million May Day commemorative leaflets, which have been widely distributed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Washington dispatch: Labor strikes in the United States are increasing unabated. More than 14,000 machinists at the Boeing Aircraft Company in Seattle began a strike a few days ago demanding wage increases, and are still persisting. A nationwide railway workers' strike is imminent. Three railway unions, representing 225,000 train drivers, firemen, and switchmen, issued a warning on the 26th: "If an agreement on their wage increase demands cannot be reached before midnight today, they will announce a strike." The nationwide strike of 100,000 meatpacking workers, which began on the 17th of last month, shows no sign of resumption. In recent days, meatpacking worker strikers in Kansas City, Denver, Colorado, and Waterloo, Iowa, have engaged in a series of bloody conflicts with the police for resisting provocations by the authorities. The nationwide coal miners' strike, which has not yet fully resumed, is not only hitting coal and iron production, but also seriously affecting the automobile industry. General Motors assembly plants will be shut down for 14 days due to a shortage of steel, and automobile production will be reduced by 40,000 vehicles.

　　美国工人反对征兵
    准备五一示威
  　全国工潮汹涌不止
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】华盛顿讯：美国劳动人民积极筹备纪念五一。“五一委员会”及类似的组织已在纽约及其他各地成立。“纽约五一委员会”于日前召开会议，到有六十个工会及其他劳工团体的代表一千人。会上订出了五一游行示威的计划；并决定游行示威将在反对战争狂与征兵、加强联合国、保护工人不受反劳工法侵害等口号下进行。纽约五一委员会印刷了十万册“为和平而斗争的一九四八年”的小册子及一百五十万份五一纪念传单，并已广为散发。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】华盛顿讯：美国工潮有增无已。西雅图波音飞机公司一万四千余器械师，于日前开始要求增资的罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。全国性铁道工人的大罢工已迫在眉睫。拥有二十二万五千火车司机、烧火工人与叉道夫的三个铁道工会，于二十六日发出警告：“如果于本日午夜前不能就其增资要求获得协议，他们即将宣布罢工。”自上月十七日开始罢工的全国十万肉类包装工人，迄无复工征象。数日来，堪萨斯城，科罗拉多州的丹佛及衣阿华州的滑铁卢等地的肉类包装工人的罢工者，因抗拒当局之寻衅而与警察发生了一连串的流血冲突。迄今仍有部分未复工的全国煤矿工人大罢工，除予煤铁生产以打击外，且严重影响了汽车业。通用汽车公司的装配工厂因钢铁之缺乏将停工十四天，汽车之减产将达四万辆。
