Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS, London: According to the "Worker's Daily," the editorial department has decided to hold a meeting on July 18th, inviting representatives from all democratic organizations to discuss international peace issues. The meeting is not planned to make any resolutions or to bind the opinions expressed at the meeting. Representatives from the organizations that send representatives may freely speak on matters they deem appropriate. The "Worker's Daily" hopes that this meeting can become a center for sincere supporters of peace and start a broad propaganda movement to strive for peace, uniting millions of people, regardless of their political differences on other issues. The editorial department of the "Worker's Daily" believes in the power of ordinary people around the world and believes that if their hatred of war and determination to maintain peace can be organized, they will be able to safeguard peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS, London: The influence of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) continues to grow among the working masses. After the Secretary of the Scottish Branch of the National Union of Mineworkers and CPGB member, Pearson, was elected to the Steering Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in early May, CPGB Executive Committee member Dickinson was elected to the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union, which has 71,000 members, in mid-May. Dan Macarthur, the Labor Party candidate who participated in the 1945 Renfrew area general election in early May, has announced his withdrawal from the Labor Party and joined the CPGB. In the last election, he obtained a surprising number of votes in the district, which has always been considered a Conservative Party district: 36,634 votes, only 5,600 votes fewer than the Conservative Party candidate Loyall.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS, London: At the annual meeting of the Postal Workers' Union, which has 150,000 members, in mid-May, representatives overwhelmingly rejected the proposal put forward by the union's General Secretary, Geddes. The proposal required the meeting to approve the TUC's policy of accepting the government's wage freeze. When Geddes put forward the proposal, saying that the government had restricted profits and reduced the burden on workers in last year's interim budget and the recent budget, a chorus of "No!" "No!" immediately erupted in the meeting hall. Representative White said: "Married people cannot survive on a weekly wage of five pounds. They are not the ones who cause inflation; it is the capitalists who cause inflation." Another representative, Bannister, pointed out that the Labor government had completely surrendered to the capitalists on the issue of profits. Concurrently with the Postal Workers' Union's annual meeting, the recent issue of "The Economist" magazine published figures stating that 503 British companies, which had declared a total profit value of 85 million pounds in the first quarter of 1945, saw their total profits rise to approximately 128 million pounds in the first quarter of this year, after two and a half years of the Labor government's rule. If the figure for the first quarter of 1945 is taken as 100, then the figure for 1946 is 106.9, for 1947 it is 102.5, and for the first quarter of this year it reaches 150.7.

  　英共在工人群众中影响继续增长
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：据工人日报宣布，该报编辑部决定于七月十八日举行会议，邀请一切民主社团派代表出席讨论国际和平问题，该项会议不计划作任何决议，不计划以会上所表示的意见约束。派有代表出席的各社团代表们，可对他们所认为适当的事情自由发言。工人日报希望这次会议能成为和平的真诚拥护者的中心，并为争取和平的广泛宣传运动开一个头，以团结成百万的人民，不论他们在其他问题上有何政治分歧。工人日报编辑部相信全世界普通人民的力量，并相信假如他们对战争的憎恨和保持和平的决心能组织起来的话，则他们是能够维护和平的。
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英共在工人群众中的影响仍继续增长中。全国矿工联合会苏格兰分会书记英共党员皮尔逊，于五月初当选为苏格兰职工大会指导委员会委员之后，英共执委狄更生又于五月中被选为拥有会员七万一千人的纺织工人联合会的中委。五月初曾参加一九四五年棱夫鲁地区大选的工党候选人丹·梅克阿瑟，已宣布退出工党，并参加了英共，在上次大选中他在该区曾使工党在一向被认为保守党的选区里，也获得了惊人的票数——三万六千六百三十四张，比保守党候选人洛雅尔仅少五千六百余票。
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：拥有十五万会员的邮政工人工会，于五月中召开的年会上，代表们曾以多数票愤然否决了该工会总书记季地斯所提议案。该议案要求会议批准英总工会关于接受政府冻结工资水准的政策，当季地斯提出该项议案，并说什么去年临时预算和最近的预算中政府限制了利润，并减少了工人的负担时，会议大厅中立即掀起了一片“不”“不”的驳斥声。代表怀特说：“已婚者靠每周五镑工资不能维持生活，他们并不是那些引起通货膨胀的人，资本家才会引起通货膨胀。”另一代表班尼斯特，指出工党政府在利润问题上已完全投降了资本家。与邮政工会年会开会同时，新近一带的“经济学家”杂志则刊载一项数字称：在一九四五年第一季，曾宣布其全部利润总值达八千五百万镑之英国五百零三家公司在工党执政两年半后，即今年的第一季，其全部利润已变为约一亿二千八百万镑，如将一九四五年第一季之数字作为一百，则一九四六年为一零六点九，一九四七年为一零二点五，今年第一季则达一五零点七。
