　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: New York News: America's democratic forces are continuing to grow and are launching struggles against the reactionary authorities. The Southern people, influenced by conservatism, are also beginning to awaken. Three hundred Black and White representatives, unwilling to be intimidated by the reactionaries, gathered in Macon, Georgia, last weekend and formally established the "People's Progressive Party" to support Wallace. The party's platform calls for the abolition of American discrimination against Black people, the outlawing of fascist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, and the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee; it also calls for the United States to adopt a peaceful foreign policy based on strengthening the United Nations and improving relations with the Soviet Union. The party also nominated Machael (publisher of the Black newspaper "Macon World") as its candidate for Senator. The Democratic Rights Committee, led by Senator Taylor and ten members of the House of Representatives, held a meeting in New York to oppose the notorious Mundt Anti-Communist Bill. The meeting was attended by representatives of 1,500 people from 351 CIO unions, 279 AFL unions, and 691 American progressive groups. The conference resolved to organize a 2,000-person "Petition Delegation to Washington" to demand that Congress reject the Mundt Bill. New York State Senators and eight members of the State Assembly jointly telegraphed all members of the House of Representatives in New York, urging them to do everything possible to defeat the Mundt Bill. The National Committee of the Slavic American Congress issued an appeal to its affiliated groups on the 9th, calling on them to participate in the movement against the Mundt Bill. The association also called for US-Soviet cooperation.
