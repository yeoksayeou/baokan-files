　　May 20th to May 26th
    After the great victory of our Central Plains People's Liberation Army in the Wanxi area, annihilating ten thousand enemies, they pointed their spears towards northern Hubei on the 15th, liberated Guanghua on the 16th, and captured the strategic point of Laohekou on the Han River held by the Chiang bandits at midnight on the 17th, annihilating over three thousand enemy troops from parts of the Chiang bandit's 163rd Brigade and 104th Brigade. Under the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, the remaining enemy troops fled west across the Han River in panic. Simultaneously with the liberation of Guanghua and Laohekou, another unit of our army recovered the cities of Dengfeng and Mixian on the 15th and 17th respectively, annihilating parts of the enemy's 47th Division and the reinforcing 41st Division, a total of over two thousand seven hundred men, who were fleeing east. In the central section of the Pinghan Railway, the city of Linying was recovered again on the 11th.
    In the Subei area, our army repelled the key "mopping-up" operation of the so-called Northern Line "Suppression" General Headquarters, composed of parts of four divisions of the Chiang bandits' 83rd, 72nd, 51st, and 44th Divisions, totaling fourteen regiments, in the Yancheng-Funing area. From the 9th to the 11th, fierce fighting broke out with the enemy along the Chaoha River, ten miles east of Yilin Town, annihilating over seven hundred of them. Fearing annihilation, the enemy scurried west on the 14th and 15th respectively. Currently, there are no enemy traces on the east bank of the Chaoha River.
    Between the Jianghuai and Han Rivers, the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces in various regions annihilated Chiang bandits and suppressed local bandits everywhere. The People's Liberation Army and local armed forces of the Jianghan Military Region annihilated over a hundred enemy troops from a part of the 82nd Brigade at Dongqiao on the Jing(shan)-Zhong(xiang) highway on the 11th. On the 16th, in two battles northeast of Zhongxiang and northeast of Anlu, a total of over two hundred enemy troops from a part of the 82nd Brigade and local bandits were annihilated. On the same day, another unit of local armed forces captured Shayang Town, which belongs to Jingmen County on the west bank of the Han River, annihilating over two hundred local bandits. The Huaibei local armed forces also recovered Sixian County on the 16th. In the central section of the Pinghan Railway, our suppression troops recently annihilated a band of local bandits in the area west of Yancheng, capturing over forty and seizing over seventy rifles. Near Fangcheng, over a hundred local bandits of Zhu Xi'an's unit were also annihilated.
    The great victory of liberating Linfen in southern Shanxi on the 17th resulted in the annihilation of over 25,000 Chiang-Yan bandit troops besieged there, including over 23,000 captured alive. Liang Peihuang, a trusted follower of the Yan bandits who had collaborated with the Japanese invaders in southern Shanxi since the War of Resistance Against Japan, engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities, and the highest commander of the enemy in Linfen, was also captured by us. A large amount of military supplies was seized. The victory of Linfen is a first congratulatory gift for the announcement of the merger of our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area. The powerful North China People's Liberation Army will continue to victoriously eradicate the isolated strongholds left by the Chiang bandits in North China until the entire North China is liberated. Deng Wenyi, the director of the bandit's political work bureau, falsely accused the People's Liberation Army of using poison gas in Linfen at a press conference last week, in order to cover up his failure and create an excuse for his crimes of using poison gas on various battlefields. The People's Liberation Army has already issued a stern warning against this inhuman crime of the Chiang bandits. If they continue to be stubborn, they will continue to receive the punishment they deserve.

专栏：=一周战况

　　一周战况
  　二十日至二十六日
    我中原解放军于宛西歼敌万人大捷之后，十五日挥戈指向鄂北，十六日解放光化，十七日午夜即攻占蒋匪在汉水上的战略要地老河口，歼守敌蒋匪一六三旅、一○四旅各一部三千余名。在解放军神速进军下，残敌仓惶渡汉水西逃。与解放光化、老河口同时，另部我军十五、十七两日先后收复了登封、密县两城，歼向东逃窜之敌四十七师及增援之敌四十一师各一部，共二千七百余名。平汉中段，十一日再度收复了临颖城。
    苏北我军在盐（城）阜（宁）地区击退由蒋匪整八三、七二、五一、四四等四个师各一部共十四个团兵力，组成所谓北线“清剿”总队的重点“扫荡”，九日至十一日在益林镇以东十余里潮河沿岸与敌展开激战，歼其七百余。敌畏被歼，十四、十五两日分别西窜，现潮河东岸已无敌踪。
    江淮河汉之间，我各地解放军与地方武装到处歼灭蒋匪，清剿土蒋。江汉军区解放军与地方武装，十一日在京（山）钟（祥）公路上之东桥歼敌八二旅一部百余，十六日在钟祥东北及安陆东北两次战斗，共歼敌八二旅一部与土蒋二百余。同日，另部地方武装攻克汉水西岸荆门县属的沙洋镇，歼土蒋二百余。淮北地方武装亦于十六日收复泗县。平汉中段我清剿部队在郾城以西地区，最近歼土蒋一股，俘四十余，缴枪七十余枝。方城附近亦歼土蒋朱希安部百余。
    晋南十七日解放临汾大捷，共歼困守蒋阎匪军二万五千余名，内生俘二万三千余名。抗战以来即在晋南勾结日寇，进行反共反人民的阎匪亲信、临汾敌最高指挥官梁培璜亦为我俘获，军火物资缴获甚众。临汾之捷，适为我晋冀鲁豫和晋察冀两解放区宣布合并为华北解放区的第一个贺礼，强大的华北人民解放军今后将继续胜利地拔除华北蒋匪残留的孤立据点，直至解放全华北。匪政工局长邓文仪于上周记者招待会中，诬蔑人民解放军在临汾施放毒气，借为其失败遮羞，并为其在各战场施放毒气罪行制造口实。蒋匪此种毫无人性罪行，人民解放军早已严正警告，如仍执迷不悟，必将继续受到应得的惩罚。
