Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 11th: Athens dispatch: The area ruled by the traitorous Greek government has become an American colony. At the end of last month, the U.S. "Aid" to Greece Mission obtained extraterritorial rights from the traitorous Greek government. It stipulates that all personnel of the U.S. mission and their families, houses, archives, and property enjoy extraterritorial status; they have priority in using the Greek postal and telecommunications services; and American companies have tax-exempt status. According to a recent report made by the U.S. mission to Washington, it proves that the traitorous Greek government is a complete puppet of American imperialism. All military organization and training, administration, finance, economy, foreign trade, transportation, agriculture, industry, social undertakings, and even public health are subject to U.S. supervision and command. People in Athens believe: "The power that the U.S. mission has obtained in Greece is equivalent to formally abolishing Greece's independence."

Another dispatch: The policy of terror implemented by the U.S. imperialists through the traitorous Greek government, aimed at massacring the people, has aroused extreme popular anger. On May 1st, the executor of the terror policy, the pseudo-Minister of Justice, Ladas, was assassinated in Athens. The puppet authorities were panicked and immediately announced martial law in the First Military District (including Athens).

    希伪政府统治区变成美帝殖民地
    【新华社陕北十一日电】雅典讯：希伪政府统治区已变成美帝殖民地。上月底，美“援”希使团从卖国的希伪政府手里又取得了治外法权。规定美使团的一切人员及其眷属、房屋、档案、财产，都享有治外法权地位；他们有使用希伪方邮电的优先权；美国公司有免税权。据不久前美使团向华盛顿所作的报告，证民希伪政府已是美帝的十足傀儡，所有军队的组织和训练、行政、财政、经济、对外贸易、运输、农业、工业、社会事业，以至于公共卫生，都受美国的监督和指挥。雅典人士认为：“美使团在希获得的权力，等于正式取消了希腊的独立”。
    另讯：美帝指使希伪府所施行的残杀人民的恐布政策，已激起民间极度愤怒。五月一日，恐布政策执行人伪司法部长拉达斯在雅典被刺身死。伪当局惊慌失措，立即宣布第一军管区（包括雅典）实行戒严。
