Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 14th: Democratic order is being rapidly established in the liberated towns of Wanxi. Democratic governments entered the cities simultaneously with our troops, issuing proclamations to reassure the people. Zhenping City was first liberated by us in mid-November last year. This time, when our troops attacked the four gates, they fought while helping the masses extinguish the fire set by the Chiang bandits who burned civilian houses. The government immediately provided relief. After the liberation on the 7th, more than 2,000 people in the city gathered to celebrate the second liberation. At the meeting, an old woman who had come from Shifosi cried out to the county magistrate, accusing the Chiang bandits of brutally murdering her son and demanding justice. Shops reopened one after another. The principal, all faculty members, and most students of the county middle school remained in the school and are now preparing to resume classes. After the liberation of Shifosi in Zhenping, Zhengxin Middle School and Beicang Girls' Middle School continued classes as usual, unaffected. On the night of the 6th, we liberated Xixiakou. At dawn, the masses flocked to the streets to see the democratic government's proclamations and other propaganda materials. When a unit of our troops was stationed in Wuligang, Neixiang, the masses had been coerced to flee by the Chiang bandits. Each squad patiently fed the silkworms of the landlords, and the second platoon even helped feed the landlord's pigs and cattle. Within two days, the masses returned one after another. Now, in response to the past rumors of the Chiang bandits, a ballad is widely circulated among the local people: "The Central Government is good, the Central Government is good, I'll run first when the Central Government comes again. The Eighth Route Army is bad, the Eighth Route Army is bad, I love the Eighth Route Army when it comes."

Xinhua News Agency, Wanxi Front, 14th: In the counties of Wanxi, the Chiang bandits demolished and burned civilian houses in various cities and towns, turning the property of thousands of households into ashes, leaving them homeless. Wang Jinsheng's bandit troops in Zhenping burned down 715 civilian houses in the four gates, burning to death more than 20 women and children who could not escape in time. In Da and Xiao Yang Villages, one mile from Nancheng, only two houses were left. Women and children who cried and refused to leave were burned to death inside. At that time, the sound of wailing could be heard from one or two miles away. One day, when the Liberation Army attacked Nanguan, the fire was raging, and the masses were wailing as they dug up corpses and remaining belongings in the smoke and fire. The Liberation Army immediately fought while helping to put out the fire and dig up corpses and furniture. Liu Zhixiu, a carpenter, sat with his two children beside a pile of rubble, pointing angrily at a line of prisoners passing by in the street and crying, "You did it! How can my family of six live now!" In Neixiang, the Chiang bandits demolished and burned more than a thousand civilian houses in the four gates. An old couple, the Wangs, who were stall vendors in Xiguan, hanged themselves from the remaining beams. Xue Bingling, the commander of the Chiang bandit militia entrenched in Xixiakou, ordered the houses within 1,000 meters around the town to be razed to the ground, and more than 200 houses in the north and south gates were destroyed. Now, the Zhenping Democratic County Government is investigating and registering the victims of the disaster and providing relief. At the same time, the township governments are mobilizing the masses to adjust and resettle each other, and distributing more than 400 public houses, public land of the security regiment, and furniture of public institutions to the victims.

　　宛西各解放城镇建立民主秩序
  　民主政府救灾安民
    【新华社宛西前线十四日电】宛西各解放城镇迅速建立民主秩序。民主政府都随军同时入城，布告安民。镇平城去年十一月中旬为我第一次解放，这次我军攻入四关时，一面战斗一面帮助群众扑灭蒋匪焚烧民房的大火，政府并即进行救济。七日解放后城内群众两千余人即集会庆祝再度解放，会上并有一从石佛寺赶来的老太太向县长喊冤，控诉蒋匪残杀了他的儿子的罪行，要求伸冤。各商店亦相继开张，县立中学校长全体教职员及大部学生则始终留在校内，现正准备复课。镇平石佛寺解放后，正心中学与北仓女子中学亦照常上课，毫未受到影响。六日夜我解放西峡口，天明后群众即群往街头争看民主政府布告及其他宣传品。某部进驻内乡五里岗时，群众被蒋匪胁迫逃走，各班都耐心的喂养着房东的蚕，第二排还帮喂房东的猪和牛，不两天群众都陆续归来。现当地群众针对过去蒋匪的造谣，普遍流传着一个歌谣：“中央好，中央好，中央再来我先跑。八路坏，八路坏，八路来了我心爱。”
    【新华社宛西前线十四日电】宛西各县蒋匪拆毁和焚烧各城关民房，几千户群众财产化为灰尽，无家可归。镇平王金声匪部曾放火烧毁四关民房七百一十五间，烧死未及逃出的妇孺廿多人。距南城一里的大小杨庄只烧剩下两间房子，哭着不愿离开的女人和孩子，许多被烧死在里面。当时一、二里地以外听着一片号哭声。一日，解放军攻入南关时，火势凶猛，群众哭成一片，在烟火场中挖掘尸体及残存的东西。解放军当即一面作战，一面帮助救火，和挖掘尸体及家具。木匠刘之秀的女人带着两个孩子坐在瓦砾堆旁，悲愤的指着街上一列列通过的俘虏哭骂：“就是你们干的，叫我一家六口怎么活呀！”内乡蒋匪拆毁和焚烧了四关千余间民房，西关摊贩王老夫妇俩在拆存的梁上吊死了。盘踞西峡口的蒋匪民团司令薛炳灵，曾下令将该镇四周一千公尺内房屋摧平，南北两关即有二百余户房屋被毁。现镇平民主县政府一面调查登记灾民，进行救济；一面由各区公所发动群众互相调剂安插，并将城内外公共房舍四百余间，保安团公地及公共机关家具分配给灾民。
