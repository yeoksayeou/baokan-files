　　How to Determine Class Status for Beekeeping and Pigeon Raising?
    Editor:
    Our village has 30 beehives, which were taken over by the Farmers' Association during the movement. Last year, we harvested about 2,000 catties of honey. We sold it in two seasons, making a profit of over 1 million yuan (the number of bees has not increased or decreased). Does this count as industry? Was it right to give it to the Farmers' Association?
　　(Asked by Wang Mingshan and Wang Qingshan, Jintidian Village, Neiqiu) Editor:
    In Liuliangshe Village, Fourth District, Xingtai, there are two questions in the class division:
    (1) "Is raising pigeons purely a sideline production that should be encouraged? Or is it a purely exploitative mode of production that should be banned?" This is what the villagers are asking. Everyone feels that the harm caused by pigeons is indeed too great: it is generally estimated that crops are damaged by pigeons for as long as three months throughout the year. One pigeon needs to eat half a he of grain per day, consuming 13 jin and 10 liang in three months. For 200 pigeons, this amounts to 253 jin. Also, according to experience, one pigeon accumulates one dou of manure per year, so 200 pigeons accumulate 20 shi. Two dou of pigeon manure can be exchanged for one dou of wheat. A household with 200 pigeons can earn 6 shi and 6 dou and 6 sheng of food per year from pigeon manure alone, which is enough to support two people. But the damage it inflicts on others is also alarming. Moreover, engaging in other sideline productions such as pig raising requires labor and bran, vegetables, and coarse grains, but raising pigeons only requires an empty room and simple equipment. Based on this situation, the unified opinion of the masses is: any middle peasant household that has a flock of pigeons should be regarded as a well-to-do middle peasant, and we must exterminate the pigeon flocks in the future. Is this completely appropriate?
    (2) Due to natural conditions, the women's labor force here is particularly strong, capable of undertaking all agricultural production. Field work such as hoeing, harrowing, watering gardens, harvesting, and even pulling the loulian (people pulling instead of livestock), is rarely beyond them. Therefore, the men all acknowledge: "We farm with men and women working together, we can't do without the women; there are even women who are more capable than us men!" This is the truth, so should women who only operate the loulian or till the land (though some can do both) necessarily be regarded as semi-labor or auxiliary labor? This is also a question from the villagers.
　　(Pei Ran, Su Jun, Ru)
    Comrades Wang Mingshan, Pei Ran, Su Jun, et al.:
    Beekeeping is a sideline in the countryside, and the Farmers' Association should not confiscate it. If beekeeping is the main source of livelihood, the class status should be handicraft laborer. If it is a large beekeeping factory, mainly employing labor, then it is a handicraft capitalist.
    Raising pigeons is a sideline in the countryside. If it damages the village's crops, the feeding can be stopped; but it should not be considered an exploitative mode of production. Class status should not be raised to well-to-do middle peasant because of this.
    If women can do heavy labor like men, they can be classified as full labor if they are between 18 and 55 years old.

### 养蜂养鸽的怎样订成份？

　　养蜂养鸽的怎样订成份？编辑同志：
    我村有三十群蜂，运动时归入农会，去年采蜜两千斤上下。两季售出，得利一百万余元（蜂数没有增减）。这算不算工业？归了农会对不对？
　　（内邱金提店村王明善、王清善问）编者同志：
    邢台四区刘良舍村在划阶级中有两个问题：
    （一）“养鸽子究竟是单纯的副业生产，应被提倡？还是单纯剥削的生产方式，应被禁绝”？这是老乡的问话。大家感到鸽子的危害性委实太大了：一般估计全年庄稼被鸽子祸害时间足在三个月，一个鸽子每天需要吃半合粮食，三个月消耗十三斤十两，以二百计，消耗二百五十三斤。又，根据经验之谈，一个鸽全年积粪一斗，二百鸽子就积二十石，鸽粪二斗能换麦一斗，一户如拥有二百个鸽，单指鸽粪就能年收六石六斗六的食粮，足可维持两个人的生活。但它所加于别人的损害确也惊人。而且，从事别的副业生产如养猪，必须付出劳力和糠、菜、杂粮，但养鸽却只要空房一间和简陋的设备就行了。根据此种情形，群众的统一意见是：凡中农户而有鸽群，便应视为富裕中农，且今后定要把鸽群杀绝；看是否完全妥当？
    （二）由于自然条件决定，此处妇女劳力特强，能担负起全部农业生产，地里活如锄地、耙地、浇园、收割，甚至拉耧（人替牲口拉）等，很少有不会的，所以男子都公认：“咱们种地是男女齐下手，离不了妇女的；妇女中还有比咱男子能干的哩！”这是真情，所以对于妇女只摇耧、耕地不会（也有会的），是否都一定要视为半劳力、辅助劳力呢？这也是老乡的问题。
　　（沛然、苏军、儒）
    王明善、沛然、苏军等同志：
    养蜂是农村中的副业，农会不应没收。如果以养蜂为主要生活来源，成份应该是手工业劳动者。如是大蜂厂，以雇佣劳动为主，则是手工业资本家。
    养鸽是农村中副业。如有损害村中田禾，可以制止喂养；但不应认为剥削的生产方式。在划成份时，也不应因此提高为富裕中农。
    妇女如能和男人一样干重劳动，即可按年在十八岁以上，五十五岁以下，订为全劳力。　　　——编者
