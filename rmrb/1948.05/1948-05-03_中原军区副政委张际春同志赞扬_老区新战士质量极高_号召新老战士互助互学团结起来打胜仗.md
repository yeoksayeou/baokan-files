Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 30th. Comrade Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, recently published an article entitled "Correctly Understand New Soldiers and Do a Good Job in the Work of New Soldiers," pointing out: The arrival of a large number of new soldiers to the front indicates that the people of the liberated areas are not only actively continuing to support the front with their financial and material resources, but also actively supporting the front with their manpower, their own children and husbands, in order to win the victory of the people's revolutionary war. This illustrates the concern and aspirations of the broad masses of people in the rear for the front lines; it demonstrates that our struggle at the front is not only coordinated with the people of neighboring areas, neighboring troops, and the KMT-controlled areas, but also directly assisted by the broad masses of people in the rear.

After the new soldiers were replenished into the troops, the general response was that their level of awareness and political enthusiasm were high. They were not afraid of hardship and were determined to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, believing that they would be able to overthrow him soon, and that the unavoidable difficulties in the course of progress would definitely be overcome. They expressed high respect for the hard lives of the veteran soldiers in the troops. Some voluntarily took out the assets they brought from their hometowns to comfort the veteran soldiers, and actively and humbly learned military skills from the veteran soldiers. The new soldiers expressed a high degree of sympathy for the peasants who had turned over in the new areas and were determined to help them achieve a complete solution. They expressed dissatisfaction and hatred for the remnants of warlordism and other bad phenomena and bad leadership in the troops. They demanded that their army be in line with the construction of a people's army, with good leadership, good command, and good comrades-in-arms, and that they be concerned about their health and progress at all times, so as to consolidate their unity and jointly annihilate the enemy. These fully demonstrated the political consciousness of the people in our liberated areas and their status and position as masters of the people. The excellent political quality of the new soldiers can quickly become the backbone of the troops. This is the result of long-term preparation and cultivation by the people of the liberated areas under the leadership of the Communist Party; it is the result of the in-depth land reform movement in the liberated areas, which Chiang Kai-shek and all reactionary armed forces can never achieve.

We are naturally very honored and excited to be able to obtain such high-quality troop replenishment, which further enhances our self-confidence. However, we must do a good job in the work of new soldiers and make full use of this favorable condition to achieve the purpose of enriching and consolidating the troops and improving the combat effectiveness of the troops.

　　(1) First of all, all cadres and veteran soldiers should cherish and value new soldiers on the basis of the above understanding. Constantly care for them, actively help and improve them, and do not despise them or relax your help to them because they are not familiar with military life and combat, have no experience, or even have certain shortcomings. These shortcomings of the new soldiers are unavoidable for a period of time, but they will soon be completely overcome.

　　(2) The new soldiers are replenished into the troops during the party consolidation and military reorganization, which is a new force. Rely on the extremely high political enthusiasm and democratic spirit of the new soldiers, carry forward the troop democratic movement, jointly review party members and cadres, improve the work of the company branch and administrative work, improve the serious disconnection between leaders, officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, the military and the people, and the Party and non-Party members, in order to improve the political enthusiasm and morale of the entire troop. The new soldiers generally feel happy and actively participate when they first arrive in the troops and encounter the democratic movement. Some consider it a kind of luck, feeling that if there were no democratic movement, they would also be suppressed by bad work styles. This is very necessary, whether from the perspective of consolidating new soldiers or from the perspective of consolidating the Party and reorganizing the military. Otherwise, if the democratic life of the troops is not established and the warlord-bureaucratic style cannot be eliminated, the good political enthusiasm of the new soldiers (like the veteran soldiers) will inevitably be constrained and harmed.

　　(3) New soldiers urgently demand to learn military technology and tactics as soon as they arrive in the troops. All cadres and veteran soldiers should be mobilized to actively and patiently help them learn, in addition to learning the political enthusiasm of the new soldiers, so that they can quickly become proficient in the necessary military technology and tactics. This is the unshirkable responsibility of cadres and veteran soldiers. Launch a mutual assistance and mutual learning movement to unite new and veteran soldiers to win battles.

　　(4) Village cadres, labor heroes, enemy-killing heroes and other activists among the new soldiers should be absorbed into various responsible tasks of the company and other appropriate work according to their ability and conditions, and they should be continuously cultivated in combat.

　　(5) Many of the veteran soldiers are liberated soldiers and have not yet had time to complete their class education. Time should be spared to complete the grievance-telling education among the veteran soldiers (the new soldiers who have not done it in the past should also do it). This is the best way to equalize the level of understanding of new and veteran soldiers and enhance the unity of new and veteran soldiers.

### 中原军区副政委张际春同志赞扬　老区新战士质量极高　号召新老战士互助互学团结起来打胜仗

　　中原军区副政委张际春同志赞扬
  　老区新战士质量极高
  　号召新老战士互助互学团结起来打胜仗
    【新华社中原前线三十日电】军区副政委张际春同志顷发表“正确认识新战士，作好新战士的工作”一文，指出：大批新战士来到前方，这表示了解放区的人民不但积极的以他们的财力物力来继续以援前线，而且积极以他们的人力、自己的子弟和丈夫来继续支援前线，以争取人民革命战争的胜利。这说明后方广大人民对于前线的关怀和愿望；说明了我们在前线的斗争不但有友邻地区、友邻部队及蒋管区人民的配合，而且有后方广大人民的直接援助。
    新战士补入部队以后，普遍的反映是觉悟程度和政治情绪高，他们不怕受苦，并坚决要打倒蒋介石，相信不久一定能打倒他，相信不可避免的前进中的困难一定能克服，对于部队中老战士的艰苦生活表示高度的敬爱，有的自动拿出从家乡带来的资财慰问老战士，并积极虚心的向老战士学习军事。对于新区翻身的农民，新战士们表示了高度的同情和决心去帮助他获得彻底的解决。对部队中的军阀作风残余及其他坏现象，坏领导表示不满和憎恨。要求自己的军队一切合乎人民军队的建设，有好的领导，好的指挥，好的战友，随时关心他们的健康和进步，以便巩固团结的共同歼灭敌人。这些充分的表现了我解放区人民政治觉悟与人民主人翁的身份和地位。新战士这种很好的政治质量，很快就可以成为部队骨干，这是解放区人民在共产党的领导下，经过长时间的准备与培养的结果；是解放区深入土地改革运动的结果，而蒋匪及一切反动武装是永远办不到的。
    我们能够得到这样好质量的兵员补充，自然非常荣幸和兴奋，从而更加提高我们的自信力。但是我们必须作好新战士的工作，充分利用这种有利条件，以达到充实和巩固部队，提高部队战斗力的目的。
    （一）首先全体干部和老战士应在上述认识的基础上，十分爱护和宝贵新战士。不断的关心他们，积极的帮助和提高他们，不要因为他们对军事生活及战斗不熟练，无经验，甚至有某些缺点，便轻视他们，放松对他们的帮助。新战士的这种缺点，在一个时期内是难免的，但不久就会完全被克服。
    （二）新战士正当整党整军中补入部队，这是一种新生的力量。应依靠新战士极高的政治热忱与民主精神，发扬部队民主运动，来共同审查党员和干部，改善连队支部工作和行政工作，改善领导之间、官兵之间、上下级之间、军民之间、党与非党之间的严重脱节现象，以提高整个部队的政治情绪和斗志。新战士一来到部队即遇到民主运动，他们一般的内心都感到愉快，积极参加，有的认为是一种幸运，觉得如果没有民主运动，自己一样亦将遭到坏作风的压制，这不论从巩固新战士着想或从整党整军着想，都是非常必要的。否则部队民主生活未能建立，军阀官僚主义作风不能去掉，新战士（老战士一样）良好的政治情绪一定要受到束缚，受到损害。
    （三）新战士一到部队迫切要求学习军事技术和战术，应动员所有干部和老战士，除应学习新战士的政治热忱外，还应积极耐心的帮助他们学习，使他们迅速熟练必要的军事技术和战术，这是干部和老战士责无旁贷的责任。开展互助互学运动，使新老战士都一致的团结起来打胜仗。
    （四）新战士中的村干部、劳动英雄、杀敌英雄及其他积极分子，应按其能力条件吸收他们参加连队各种负责工作及其他适当的工作，并在战斗中不断的培养他们。
    （五）老战士中不少解放战士并未来得及全部进行阶级教育，应在老战士中争取时间完成诉苦教育（新战士过去未进行过的亦应进行），这是齐一新老战士的认识水准，增进新老战士团结的最好方法。
