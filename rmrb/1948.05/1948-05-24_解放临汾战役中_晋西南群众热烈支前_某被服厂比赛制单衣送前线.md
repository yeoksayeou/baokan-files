　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 22nd: During the battle to liberate Linfen, the people of Southwestern Shanxi enthusiastically supported the front lines. More than 500 people from the Hongdong and Zhaocheng districts voluntarily formed stretcher teams, with each stretcher equipped with mats, quilts, and water bottles. Li Anlun, a middle peasant in his fifties, also came to the front lines to transport the wounded and successfully completed his task. Women in the district made more than 800 pairs of military shoes and washed more than 2,000 sets of clothes in seven days. The young and strong men and women and primary school students remaining in the villages organized themselves to transport manure and cultivate the land. Coal miners in Tanghou Village and other places in Pu County worked in the mines at night and helped the masses supporting the front lines with planting and delivering manure during the day. The masses in the newly liberated area of Linfen West also enthusiastically participated in the war with a spirit of revenge, and the local masses warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 22nd: Workers in a certain clothing factory here are rushing to make summer uniforms for the soldiers on the front lines, voluntarily extending working hours, increasing "voluntary labor," and launching competitions. The output in the first week of March exceeded the output in February by 70%. It then progressed week by week, and by April it had exceeded the output in February by 150%. It is expected that the task will be completed this month. At normal work efficiency, it would take until the end of August to complete it. Worker An Guoting pricked his finger, but he quickly bandaged the wound and continued to work. Many people work 13 to 14 hours a day. In order to prevent workers from becoming overly fatigued, the factory leadership was forced to implement lighting controls and lock the dormitory doors on time, but this could not stop the workers' enthusiasm for labor. They said: The troops at the front are fighting further and further away. It won't do if we don't send them summer uniforms. It doesn't matter if we suffer a little bit in the rear. Worker Guo Chenglin brought 200 military uniform pockets home after work and crumpled them in his dormitory. After the lights were turned off, he kept crumpling them in bed until he finished them the next day to make sewing the pockets easier. The machine repair team proposed "not to let a single machine rest." There was a short period when quantity was pursued at the expense of quality, but this was immediately corrected after it was discovered. Currently, the general dark thread has ten stitches per inch, and the visible thread has twelve to thirteen stitches per inch. Each team used to consume one jin of sewing machine oil every day, but now it only consumes one jin every two to three days, and four liang of thread can be saved every day. At the May Day conference, the factory won the "Production Model" certificate and prizes.

　　解放临汾战役中
  　晋西南群众热烈支前
    某被服厂比赛制单衣送前线
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】晋西南人民在攻克临汾战役中，热情支援前线。洪（洞）赵（城）二区五百余人，自动组成担架队，每付担架都备有席子、棉被与水壶。五十多岁的中农李安伦，也来往前线抬运伤员，胜利完成任务。该区妇女七天内做完八百双军鞋，拆洗二千多套衣服。留在村内的青壮年和妇女、小学生组织起来运粪种地。蒲县唐候村等地煤工为支援前线，黑夜下窑，白天帮助支前群众种地送粪，新获解放之临（汾）西群众，在复仇情绪下亦踊跃参战，当地群众并热情招待解放军。
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】此间某被服厂工人为前线将士赶制单衣，自动延长工作时间，并增加“义务工”，发动竞赛。三月份第一周即超过二月份产量百分之七十，以后逐周上进，至四月份已超过二月份产量百分之一百五十。预计本月即可全部完成任务，如按平时工作效率须八月底方可完成。工人安国庭扎破手指，他速将伤口包裹后，仍继续工作。许多人每天工作十三小时至十四小时。工厂领导上为防止工人过分疲劳，被迫实行灯火管制，按时锁工房门。但不能阻止工人劳动热情。他们说：前方部队越打越远，不送去单衣不行，我们在后方吃点苦不算什么，工人郭成林在下工时，带了二百件军衣口袋，回至寝室捏成绉纹，熄灯后，一直睡在床上捏完，次日缝袋方便。机器修理组，提出“不让一架机子休息”。曾有一短时期由于追求数量，而忽视质量，发现后立刻纠正。目前一般暗线每寸十针，明线每寸十二至十三针，每一小组过去每天耗费滑机油一斤，现二天到三天才耗费一斤，且每天可省线四两。“五一”大会上，该厂曾荣获“生产模范”奖状及奖品等。
