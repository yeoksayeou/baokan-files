　　Production Dynamics
    Loans Issued Based on Fruit Yields: Gaoyi Solves Spring Famine
    [Gaoyi News] Statistics from fourteen disaster-stricken villages in Gaoyi show that 1,356 people are currently without food, accounting for one-seventh of the population. In Zhangjia Village and Wangjia Village, half of the villagers are without food. Coupled with the lack of farming tools and livestock, spring plowing is even more difficult. In light of the above situation, the county has researched three solutions: (1) Temporarily lend existing fruits to the masses for production. For example, Zhangjia Village has 440,000 yuan worth of fruit, and Cechun Village has five mules and more than 13 *shi* of grain; Donghan Village has more than 1,000 *jin* of millet, more than 5 *shi* of miscellaneous grains, 15 waterwheels, 12 carts, and 3 livestock. If these items are properly handled, they can solve part of the problem, and the orchard land will also be lent to landless households for cultivation. (2) Concentrate the use of loans according to the disaster situation and the conditions of the village (the amount of existing fruits). The county's 10 million yuan will lend 7 million yuan to these fourteen villages to organize mass production. (3) The exchange lent out 19,000 *jin* of cotton to support weaving (now completed).

    Shouyang County Cooperative Assists in Overcoming Famine
    [Shouyang News] The county cooperative in this county organizes the masses to produce for self-rescue. 1. All business departments actively supply women throughout the county with cotton for weaving and promote finished products. It has now collected 1,200 *zhang* of cloth, borrowed 4,000 *jin* of raw cotton from Zuoquan, and divided it into three places for fluffing; lent out 2,340 *jin* of cooked cotton, purchased 10,000 *jin* of edible salt, and has already allocated more than 5,000 *jin*. 2. The masses in various districts are seriously ill, so a mobile Chinese and Western medicine treatment center was established, carrying medicines to provide medical treatment to the masses in various villages. Those in difficulty will not be charged for medicine now, but will pay after the autumn harvest. 3. A small-scale woodworking factory was established, organizing four carpenters to manufacture weaving equipment and spinning wheels for weaving women, repair agricultural tools, and manufacture agricultural tools. Those who cannot afford to pay wages now will repay them after the autumn harvest, and it has now begun to go to the countryside. Ten hand-operated shuttles and nine accelerated spinning wheels were also lent out. (Qinglan, Shanfu)

The county's population of 190,000 has exceeded one and a half times the average of one tree per person.
