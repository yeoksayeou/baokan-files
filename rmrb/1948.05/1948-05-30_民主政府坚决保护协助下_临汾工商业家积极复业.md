From the Jinan Front, 27th Dispatch: After the liberation of Linfen, under the long-term policy of building the city, the democratic government correctly implemented the industrial and commercial policies, and the factories and shops in the city have quickly recovered. Before the liberation, the bandit army in the city slandered the Communist Party with lies such as "twenty-four tortures, thirty-six killings, and confiscation of property," frightening the masses. At that time, the merchants and residents in the city were resigned to their fate. However, after Linfen was completely liberated on the 18th, the city was in good order; the merchants saw that even the People's Liberation Army did not even privately enter people's houses or shops; the government immediately issued a notice, clearly pointing out that enemy factories would be confiscated, public commercial hospitals would be taken over by the public, private industry and commerce would be protected, free operation would be allowed, and assistance would be given for development. In the afternoon, the water plant had resumed work, delivering water to the houses on time. At this time, Wang Tingzhou, a fifty-year-old auto worker from Dongguan, ran into the city and said to his son, "This time we have found our true masters, let's work hard and don't damage the machines. The Second War Zone said they (referring to the People's Liberation Army) were killing people, but they didn't even kill a chicken in Dongguan." On this day, the merchants heard and saw the strict discipline of our army, and half of their doubts were dispelled. On the 19th, Mayor Shi and Secretary Zhang of the Municipal Party Committee personally went to the merchants to inquire about the recovery situation, and held a symposium for industrialists and businessmen, where Deputy Director Pei of the Administrative Office specially introduced the industrial and commercial policies. Everyone heard that the railway would be opened in the future, and the factories would be restored, and they happily said: business will be developed in the future. Dr. Wang of the Wanquantang Pharmacy in Linfen, a branch of Peiping, said at the time: "I will write to Peiping to see if medicine can be shipped." When accepting the materials of the bandits and puppets, Gao Binhui, the owner of the Lutong Bus Station, saw that the government did not take his six cars when accepting the cars left by the bandit army. Only then did he truly understand that the government allowed the development of private capital, and he automatically ran to the government to ask for help in development. At this point, the industrialists and businessmen were calm and actively engaged in resuming their operations. The workers in the factories repaired the machines in the midst of aerial sweeps, and erected electric poles by moonlight. The workers also automatically dug out the machine parts buried by the bandit army. By the 22nd, five machinery industries including Linfen Power Plant, Flour Company, Water Plant, Fuxing Iron Factory, and Northwest Manufacturing Branch Factory had largely resumed work, with 300 workers going to work as usual. Of the 450 original merchants in Linfen City, except for the hundred or so shops in Dongguan that were completely destroyed by heavy bombs after the bandit army withdrew from Dongguan, and the shops that could not resume business due to heavy extortion by the bandits in the city, the remaining shops dug out all the mud walls that had been sealed on the old doors, and swept the storefronts from the beginning. As of the 26th, nearly a hundred shops have opened for business; as for the street vendors, they are even more crowded in the market. At this time, Lu Xinghai, the shopkeeper of Tongsheng Yan Store, said excitedly: "The People's Liberation Army is here, it's so happy, I haven't been so free as today in nineteen years. In the past (referring to the period of bandit army rule) they also said liberation! Only two gates in Dongguan were opened, this is the real liberation! Look, the four gates are wide open, no road passes are needed."

　　民主政府坚决保护协助下
  　临汾工商业家积极复业
    【晋南前线二十七日电】临汾解放后，民主政府在长期建设城市的方针下，正确的执行了工商业政策，城内工厂、商店已迅速恢复。解放前城内匪军诬蔑共产党以“二十四刑，三十六杀，及买卖充公”等谎言恫吓群众，当时城内商民均抱以听天由命的心理，至十八日临汾全部解放后，城内秩序井然；商家眼看着解放军连私进民房、商店的都没有；当日政府即颁发布告，明白指出没收敌人工厂，公商医院归公接办，保护私人工商业，自由经营，并帮助发展。下午自来水厂已经复工，按时将水送给住房。这时东关五十多岁的汽车工人王亭州跑到城内，一见他的儿子就说：“这一下咱们可找到真主子了，好好干吧，不要损坏机器。二战区说人家（指解放军）杀人，人家在东关连只鸡都没杀。”这天各商家耳闻眼见我军纪律严明，疑心已去一半。十九日石市长、张市委亲自到各商家询问恢复情形，并召集工商业座谈会，由行署裴副主任专门介绍工商业政策。大家听说将来铁路要通，又要恢复各个工厂，高兴的说：以后买卖可要发达。北平分设临汾万全堂药铺的王医生当时即说：“我以后要给北平去信，看能运来药不能。”在接受匪伪物资时，路通汽车站的老板高彬辉看着政府接受匪军遗留的汽车时并没有拿去他的六部汽车，他才确实明白政府是允许私人资本发展，即自动跑到政府要求帮助发展。至此工商业家已心平气和积极从事复业。各工厂工人在飞机横扫中抢修机器，乘月夜架修电灯杆。工人并将匪军在时埋藏之机器零件自动挖出。至二十二日临汾发电厂、面粉公司、自来水厂、复兴铁工厂、西北制造分厂等五家机器工业已大部复工，有三百名工人照常上班。临汾城商业原有坐商四百五十家，除匪军退出东关后以重磅炸弹将东关百余家商店全数毁灭，及匪在城内时重款勒索致使商店无法复业者外，其余商店将旧日门上封垒之泥墙全部挖开，从新打扫门面。截至二十六号已有将近百家铺门营业；至于街头摊贩，更云集于市。这时同生眼商店的掌柜鲁星海兴奋的说：“解放军来了，可痛快了，十九年都没有今天这样自由。过去（指匪军统治时期）也说解放哩！只开了东关两个城门，这次才叫真解放哩！你看看四门大开，不要路条。”
