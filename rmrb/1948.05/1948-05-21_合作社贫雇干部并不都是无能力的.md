　　Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Cadres in Cooperatives Are Not All Incompetent

To the Editor:
    We read the article "Take Production and Disaster Relief as the Current Central Task" (Editorial of Taihang Xinhua Daily), published on page one of your newspaper on May 11th (No. 713), and we felt it was very good and suited the current demands of the masses. When we saw the third paragraph, "Under the influence of the 'rectification movement' last winter, winter production did not develop," including the eight lines that say, "Some cooperative cadres who originally had experience and ability were knocked down and refused to work because they were attacked, replaced by so-called poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, poor and lower-middle peasant chairmen, and poor and lower-middle peasant accountants who had no ability or experience, resulting in most cooperatives being on the verge of collapse and rural side businesses generally unable to find a way out." Our opinion is that poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, poor and lower-middle peasant chairmen, and poor and lower-middle peasant accountants are not completely inexperienced and incompetent. Some of them belong to the above situation, but some of them have achieved good results, have experience, and are capable. It is more appropriate to distinguish between them. Otherwise, those who can serve the people as hired laborers and better poor and lower-middle peasant representatives will be ideologically affected when they see this. Do you think our suggestion is correct? We hope to be informed.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　Readers Yuqin, Laicheng, and Liuxi, May 13th

To Comrades Yuqin, Laicheng, and Liuxi:
    Your opinion is very correct. We did not specifically point out that "some of them are doing very well, have ability, and have experience," which is a shortcoming. We will pay attention to this in the future. We hope you will also explain this point to the poor and lower-middle peasants in your work.

### 合作社贫雇干部并不都是无能力的

专栏：批评与建议

　　合作社贫雇干部并不都是无能力的编者同志：
    贵报五月十一号（七一三号）一版刊载的“把生产救灾当作当前的中心工作”一文（太行新华日报社论），我们读了感觉很好，正适合目前群众要求。看到第三段“去冬在‘检查运动’的影响下，冬季生产没有开展起来”，当中八行所说的“原来一些有经验有能力的合作干部，因被打击而躺倒不干，代之以无能力无经验的所谓贫雇代表，贫雇社长，贫雇会计，致使多数合作社濒于垮台绝境，农村副业普遍找不到出路”。我们的意见，贫雇代表，贫雇社长，贫雇会计，不是完全无经验、无能力的，有一部分是属于上述情况；但有一部分搞的还是有成绩，有经验，有能力的。区别开来讲比较是合适的。否则，那些能为人民服务当长工和较好的贫雇代表们看到，思想是会受到影响的。我们提的是否对呢？希告知。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者　玉芹、来成、柳溪　五月十三日玉芹等同志：
    你们的意见很对，我们没有分别指明，“有一部分干得很好，有能力，有经验”，这是一个缺点。将在今后注意。希你们在工作中也向贫雇说明这点。
