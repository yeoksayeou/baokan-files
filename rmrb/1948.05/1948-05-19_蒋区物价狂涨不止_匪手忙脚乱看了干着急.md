　　Chiang Area Commodity Prices Soar Uncontrollably
  　Bandits Frantically Watch, Anxious but Helpless
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Comprehensive foreign news agency reports: The economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas is advancing madly. On the 11th, the price of rice in Shanghai soared to a peak of 6 million Chiang currency per dan, six times that of the beginning of the year. The black market exchange rate for US dollars rose even further to 1.3 million, an increase of nearly eight times compared to the beginning of the year. Gold also rose to 63 million per tael, and Chinese and foreign stocks rose by 15 percent on the 10th. Cotton yarn and other goods are also soaring. The Chiang bandits are frantically trying to cope. In recent days, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek held "emergency meetings" with his Minister of Finance, Yu Hung-chun; the bandit "National Economic Commission" held meetings to discuss the situation; and the bandit Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Kuo-chen, convened meetings with the Shanghai Grain Rationing Committee and wealthy merchants; and ordered the police to arrest 44 businessmen in the financial industry successively, but the rising trend became even more intense. The semi-official Associated Press of the US imperialists admitted: "Chinese legal tender (referring to Chiang currency) is now the most worthless paper money in the world." According to financial experts of the Chiang bandit government: Due to the Chiang bandits' military failures and endless vicious inflation, "there is no hope of reversing commodity prices."

　　蒋区物价狂涨不止
  　匪手忙脚乱看了干着急
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合外国通讯社消息：蒋区经济风暴疯狂疾进。十一日上海米价每担已跃登六百万元蒋币的高峰，为年初之六倍。黑市美钞更涨到一百三十万，较年初上涨几达八倍。黄金每两亦涨到六千三百万元，中外股票十日已上涨百分之十五。棉纱及其他货物亦在飞涨中。蒋匪已为此手忙脚乱，数日以来匪首蒋介石曾与其财政部长俞鸿钧举行“紧急会议”；匪“全国经济委员会”曾开会商讨；匪上海市长吴国桢并曾召开上海粮食配售委员会及富商会议；并饬令警察先后逮捕金融业商人四十四人，但涨风愈加猛烈。美帝半官方的美联社承认：“中国法币（指蒋币）现在是世界上最不值钱的纸币”。据蒋匪政府之金融专家称：由于蒋匪军事失败及无休止的恶性通货膨胀等原因，“物价已无挽回的希望了。”（合众社）
