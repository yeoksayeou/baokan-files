The National Council of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People," the largest black organization, unanimously passed a resolution calling for a struggle to defeat the "Mundt Bill, which threatens civil rights." The Progressive Party of Connecticut held an anti-Mundt Bill protest rally in Newport the other day.
