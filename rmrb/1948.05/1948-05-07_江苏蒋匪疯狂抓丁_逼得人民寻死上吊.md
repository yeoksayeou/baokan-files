Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd. Combined Shanghai newspaper reports: Chiang bandits' atrocities of seizing recruits in Jiangsu Province are extremely vicious. Recently, in the urban and rural areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Chiang bandits have been using "rice bonuses" to buy off local thugs and ruffians, who lurk near stations and on main roads, and when they see young men, they put ropes over their heads, tie them up, and take them away. In Changzhou and other places, Chiang bandits put black dots on the draft lottery tickets, and no matter how they draw, they always draw on the heads of poor people who have no money or power. The Xuzhou bandit municipal government, under the pretext of investigating household registration, seized 5,000 people in a single sweep in Beiguan. Chiang bandits in Chongming County had already seized recruits three times last year, totaling 3,000 men. Recently, they suddenly demanded another 1,637 men. Fearing that young men would easily avoid being drafted when the green crops grew tall, the bandits stipulated that each township should "pre-borrow" 50 strong men and ordered the suspension of identity cards and exit permits in an attempt to prevent the island's young men from fleeing. Under the mad draft of Chiang bandits, tragedies continue to occur everywhere and have aroused popular resistance. The drafting of 100 men in Dongyantou, Chongming, caused young men to flee to the sea, resulting in the drowning of five people. A young man in Liujia Village, Shitangwan, Wuxi, preferred death to serving as a Chiang soldier. After being selected in the lottery, he said, "It is better to die at home than to go out to die," and then slept in a coffin and burned himself to death. In a family of three in Zhenjiang, a newly married daughter-in-law's younger brother was drafted, and her husband was also taken away, forcing her to hang herself. The old man was so angry that he grabbed an axe, ran to kill the bandit Baochang, then killed the township head, and finally committed suicide. Young men in Chongming formed groups to sleep in the open in the wild, taking turns on watch with wooden sticks, iron hammers and other weapons, ready to attack Chiang bandits who seize recruits, and posted slogans everywhere to warn bandit township and Bao chiefs.

　　江苏蒋匪疯狂抓丁
  　逼得人民寻死上吊
    【新华社华东三日电】综合沪报消息：蒋匪在江苏省抓丁暴行穷凶极恶。蒋匪近在沪宁铁路沿线一带城乡，以“米奖金”收买地痞流氓，潜伏在车站附近和要路上，看到青年就把绳子往头上一套，拴起就走。常州等地蒋匪在抽签时涂上黑点，抽来抽去，总是抽在没钱没势的穷人头上。徐州匪市府借调查户口，在北关一次即搜抓五千人。崇明县蒋匪在去年曾抓丁三次，计三千名，最近一下子又要一千六百三十七名，匪恐青纱帐起时，青年易于躲避抓丁，竟规定每乡“预借”壮丁五十名，并下令停发身份证、外出证，图阻止该岛青年外逃。在蒋匪疯狂的抽抓之下，各地不断发生惨剧，且已激起人民反抗。崇明东沿头抓丁百人，引起青年纷纷逃向海上，致淹死五人。无锡石塘湾刘家村一青年宁死不甘当蒋家兵，被抽中签后说：“出去送死不如死在家里”，遂睡在棺材里自焚而死。镇江某家三口，新娶媳妇因娘家弟弟被抓丁，随着丈夫亦被抓去，迫而上吊自尽。老头愤极拿起斧头奔去把匪保长砍死，接着又把乡长砍死，最后自杀身死。崇明青年刻成群结队的在野外露宿，以木棒铁锤等武器轮流放哨，随时准备打击抓丁蒋匪，并遍贴标语警告匪乡保长。
