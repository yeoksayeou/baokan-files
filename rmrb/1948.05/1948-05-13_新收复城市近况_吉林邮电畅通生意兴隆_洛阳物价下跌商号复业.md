Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Recent conditions in newly recovered cities:

    In Jilin City, industrial and commercial loans have been issued. The shoe industry has received 4 million yuan in loans, the grain and rice processing industry 3.5 million yuan, and the department store industry 3 million yuan. The market is becoming increasingly prosperous. With the exception of some that are still undergoing machinery repairs, all industries have resumed work. The output of some factories has doubled compared to when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the city. The Tongtian district is the most bustling, and all businesses are putting their own spin on decorations and advertisements. Postal and telecommunications are smooth throughout villages and cities. The Harbin-Jilin railway has officially opened, and merchants are arriving in a steady stream. The railway to places like Meihekou is also about to open. When revolutionary war films are shown in cinemas, every showing is packed. The Jilin branch of the Northeast Bookstore is doing particularly well.

    In Luoyang City, more than 60 percent of businesses have reopened. Of the more than 300 businesses on North Street, 239 have opened, several times more than during the period when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the city. The market price of flour continues to fall, from 45,000 yuan in Chiang currency per jin to 310 yuan in Jicha (each yuan is equivalent to 70 yuan in Chiang currency). Cotton has fallen from 85,000 yuan in Chiang currency per jin to 900 yuan in Jicha, and salt has fallen from 65,000 yuan in Chiang currency per jin to 600 yuan in Jicha. Businessmen and merchants reflect that with the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, making money is a sure thing, and business has a future.

    In Weihaiwei City, more than 200 businesses have opened. Many stores that moved to the countryside when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded Weihai last year have recently returned to the city one after another. The 23 businesses, including De Weisheng, that were deceived by the enemy have been carefully protected by the government-organized Management Committee. When businessmen such as Xinhua and Shengshou bicycle shops returned to the city after escaping danger a few days ago, the government immediately returned all their property and helped them quickly resume business. During the Chiang Kai-shek bandit occupation, the most prosperous Xinwei Road was closed down, and more than 300,000 jin of fish were looted from more than 20 fishing businesses.

    新收复城市近况
    吉林邮电畅通生意兴隆
    洛阳物价下跌商号复业
    【新华社陕北十一日电】新收复城市近况：
    吉林市发放工商业贷款，鞋业已贷到四百万元，粮米加工业贷到三百五十万元，百货业三百万元，市面日趋繁荣，各项工业除部分尚在装修机件外，均已复工，若干厂产量较蒋匪侵占时增加一倍。通天区一带最热闹，各商号都别出心裁，加作装璜广告。邮电畅通各村镇城市。哈（尔滨）吉铁路已正式通车，客商络绎不绝，通梅河口等地铁路亦通车在即。各电影院放映革命战争新片时，场场客满。东北书店吉林分店生意特佳。
    洛阳市商号已有百分之六十以上复业，北大街三百多商行中开张达二百三十九户，超过蒋匪盘踞时期数倍。面粉市价继续下降，每斤由蒋币四万五千元降至冀钞三百十元（每元合蒋币七十元），棉花每斤由蒋币八万五降至冀钞九百元，盐每斤由蒋币六万五降至冀钞六百元，商民的反映是：废除了苛捐杂税，赚钱十稳，生意有做头。
    威海卫市已有二百余家商行开门营业，去年蒋匪侵陷威市时转移至农村之许多商店，近已陆续迁回市内。被敌骗走之德威盛等二十三家商号，已由政府组织保管委员会周密保护。新华、盛寿脚踏车行等行商，日前脱险返市后，政府当即发还其全部财产，并助其迅速复业。蒋匪侵占时最繁荣的新威路家家闭户，二十余家渔行被抢劫鱼三十余万斤。
