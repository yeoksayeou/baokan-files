　　Resolution to Resist the US Imperialist Split of Korea
  　Pyongyang Conference Successfully Concludes
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: TASS, Pyongyang, 27th of last month, reports: The joint conference of democratic parties and groups from North and South Korea recently passed a resolution on the current political situation in Korea. It stated briefly: The US government, disregarding the strong protests of the Korean people, is still using the so-called United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea to hastily pass resolutions, deciding to conduct a divisive election in South Korea, fabricate a "national government," and attempt to create a final split in Korea, turning South Korea into a US colony. The people of South Korea have not yet obtained basic democratic rights or hope for improved living conditions. The people of North Korea have achieved significant achievements in democratic reforms and national cultural revival. In order to oppose the dismemberment of the motherland and the enslavement of the South Korean people, we believe that all democratic parties and social organizations must unite and declare a nationwide boycott movement against the divisive elections being planned in South Korea. The resolution finally requests that the Soviet Union's proposal be accepted, and that the US and the Soviet Union immediately withdraw their troops from Korea. The conference also passed a statement to the Soviet and American governments, elaborating the above-mentioned propositions, protesting the US imperialist conspiracy to split and enslave Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Pyongyang, reports: The joint conference of democratic parties and groups from North and South Korea concluded on the 23rd, after five days of meetings, in an atmosphere of shared hatred and solidarity. At the meeting, He Kang, leader of the South Korean People's Democratic Front, gave a detailed report on the US military authorities in South Korea's conspiracy to plan divisive elections and organize a puppet government, as well as on the South Korean people's struggle against divisive elections, which was warmly endorsed by the delegates. Kim Ha-sam, representative of the South Korean Workers' Party, Yun Lang-wa, representative of the South Korean People's Republican Party, He Men, leader of the South Korean Democratic Independence Party, and many other delegates, in their speeches, expressed strong hatred and protest against the treasonous crimes of the US imperialists and Korean traitors such as Syngman Rhee. The conference unanimously resolved to organize a widespread movement to boycott the divisive elections. Establish central and provincial boycott committees, and conduct in-depth boycott propaganda among the masses at all levels, to fight resolutely against the divisive elections held in South Korea on May 10. The conference also decided to send letters to the US and Soviet authorities, expressing support for the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops.

　　决议抵制美帝分裂朝鲜
  　平壤会议圆满闭幕
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社平壤上月二十七日讯：南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议，日前通过对朝鲜目前政治形势的决议。略称：美政府不顾朝鲜人民的强烈抗议，现仍利用所谓联合国临时朝鲜委员会，匆匆通过决议，决定在南鲜进行分裂选举，伪造“国民政府”，妄图造成朝鲜的最后分裂，并把南鲜变为美国的殖民地。南鲜人民迄今仍未获得基本的民主权利和改善生活条件的希望。北鲜人民在民主改革与民族文化复兴等方面，已获得重大成就。为了反对祖国被肢解和南鲜人民被奴役，我们认为：各民主党派和社会团体必须团结一致，并对在南鲜筹划中的分裂选举，宣布全国性的抵制运动。决议最后要求接受苏联建议，美苏立即自朝鲜撤军。该会议并通过致苏美政府声明书，申述上述主张，抗议美帝分裂和奴役朝鲜的阴谋。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社平壤讯：南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议于集会五天后，已于二十三日在同仇敌忾与团结合作的气氛中闭幕。会上南鲜人民民主阵线领袖何抗作了关于南鲜美军当局阴谋策划分裂选举和筹组伪政府以及关于南鲜人民反对分裂选举的斗争之详尽报告，获得了与会代表的热烈拥护。南鲜工党代表金河森、南鲜人民共和党代表云浪瓦、南鲜民主独立党领袖贺门及其他许多与会代表，在发言中对美帝及李承晚等鲜奸的叛卖罪行，咸表强烈的憎恨和抗议。大会一致决议：组织广泛抵制分裂选举的运动。建立中央与各省的抵制委员会，并深入各阶层群众进行抵制宣传，为坚决反对南鲜于五月十日举行的分裂选举而斗争。大会并决定致函美苏当局，表示拥护苏联所提美苏同时撤兵的建议。
