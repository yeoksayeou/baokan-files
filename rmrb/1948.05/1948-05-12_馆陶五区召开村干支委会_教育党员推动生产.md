    Guantao Fifth District Convenes Village Cadre Branch Committee
    Educating Party Members to Promote Production
    [Guantao News] The Fifth District's correct propaganda policy educates Party members and encourages the masses to produce with peace of mind. Initially, the masses had various ideological concerns and misunderstandings about the Land Law Outline. Party members and village cadres also did not understand the rectification and democratic process within the Party. For example, some Party members said: "The Communist Party is not going to work anymore. Party members, good or bad, are not wanted." They regretted joining the Party. Some even said: "Seven or eight years in the Party are not as good as one poor peasant league member." On April 6th, a mass meeting of the village was held, and the Land Law Outline was correctly explained. Following this, a village cadre branch committee meeting was convened, explaining that the spirit of rectification and democracy within the Party is to transform the ideology and work style of Party members, clarify right and wrong, delineate responsibilities, and not wrong anyone. After this propaganda, some Party members said: "My heart is at ease. I can lead production well. The Party still needs us." Party members with mistakes are also not afraid, believing that the Party is transforming their mistakes and giving them a bath. In this way, everyone's production enthusiasm is very high, and they feel there is a way out. Ideologically, they are fully prepared for their own villages to carry out rectification after the base point villages are completed. They are all determined to lead production well and ensure that not an inch of land is left uncultivated. (Tian Fang, Pan Si, Chao Ping)

    馆陶五区召开村干支委会
    教育党员推动生产
    【馆陶消息】五区正确的宣传政策，教育党员推动群众安心生产。开始群众存在各种思想顾虑，对于土地法大纲有误解，党员村干对于整党民主也不了解，如有的党员说：“不兴共产党员啦，党员不分好坏都不要啦”，后悔不该加入党。更有的说：“在党七八年，不如一个贫农团”。四月六号召开了片村的群众大会，正确的讲解了土地法大纲；继之召开了村干支委会，讲明了整党民主的精神是改造党员的思想作风，弄清是非，划清责任，不能冤屈一个人。这样宣传后，有的党员说：“心放肚里啦，可好好的领导生产吧，党里边还要咱呢”。有错误的党员也不害怕了，认为党是改造他的错误，给他洗个澡。这样大家生产情绪很高，感到有出路了，思想上都充分的准备着基点村整完之后，好来自己村整。他们都有决心把生产领导好，保证不荒一亩地。（天放、泮思、超平）
