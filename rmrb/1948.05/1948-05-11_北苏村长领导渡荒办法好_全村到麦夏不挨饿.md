    [Yuanshi News] North Su Village is a severely drought-stricken village in the sixth district of Yuanshi. Of the 207 households in the village, with a population of 949, as early as last winter, 80 to 90 households had nothing to eat or drink. Village Chief Wu Qiude, seeing this difficulty, held a meeting with the disaster-stricken people, explaining the severity of the drought and the need to engage in production for self-salvation, rather than solely relying on the higher authorities for solutions. He led the masses in building twelve spinning flower cellars (each cellar can accommodate ten to fifteen spinning wheels) and three weaving cellars (each can accommodate seven to nine looms). At the beginning of spring, they mobilized 205 spinning wheels and 29 looms to spin and weave. Each cellar is like a small factory. After securing loans, they bought another 45 spinning wheels, now totaling 250 spinning wheels and 29 looms, all operating. Spinning flowers alone can earn 70,000 yuan a day. In addition, they organized 45 small vendors to carry goods for transport, 32 households to sell tofu, and one blacksmith and two carpenters to make agricultural tools and handicraft tools. The entire village earns approximately 180,000 yuan a day. Wang Si's family of eight, with eight mu of land, weaves 70 square feet of cloth every day, and the entire family relies on this loom for food. Hou Xi's family of five spins one catty of cotton per day, earning 45,000 yuan from the first month until now. As a result of this production for self-salvation, the problems of the 80 to 90 disaster-stricken households have been resolved. Now, all the farmers in the village can sustain themselves until the wheat harvest without going hungry. The village chief also leads the masses in creating a method of combining agricultural and sideline production, vigorously promoting agricultural production. One poor peasant said: "Without Qiude's leadership in our village, I don't know how many people would have starved to death." (Wang Bingzhang)

    北苏村长领导渡荒办法好
    全村到麦夏不挨饿
    【元氏消息】北苏村是元氏六区一个严重的灾荒村，全村二百零七户人家，九百四十九口人，去冬即有八九十户没有吃喝，村长武秋德见到这种困难，给灾民开会，说明灾荒严重，要生产自救，不能光依靠上级想办法。并领导群众打了十二个纺花窨子（每个窨子能容十辆到十五辆纺车），三个织布窨子（每个可容七个到九个机子），开春即把二百零五个纺车二十个织布机动员起来纺织，每个窨子好象一个小工厂。经过贷款又买四十五个纺车，现在共有二百五十个纺车，二十九个织布机，全部动着，光纺花一项一天可挣七万元。另外还组织四十五个小商贩担挑运输，卅二户卖豆腐，一个铁匠、两个木匠打制农具及手工业工具，全村一天约可挣十八万元。王四家八口人，八亩地，每天织七十方尺布，全家八口人全靠这张机子吃饭。侯喜担五口人，每天纺小秤一斤花，正月到现在挣四万五千元。这样生产自救结果，八九十户的灾民问题解决了，现在全村农民都能维持到麦夏不挨饿，村长又领导群众创造农副业结合生产的办法，大力推动农业生产。一个贫农说：“俺村没有秋德领导，不知要饿死多少人”。（王秉章）
