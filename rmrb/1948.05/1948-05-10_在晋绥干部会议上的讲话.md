Comrades! Today I want to talk mainly about some issues related to the work of Jin-Sui, and then about some issues related to the national work.

(1) I believe that in the past year, the land reform work and the party rectification work in the area under the leadership of the Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau have been successful.

This is viewed from two aspects. On the one hand, the Jin-Sui Party opposed the right-leaning deviation, mobilized the mass struggle, and completed or is completing the land reform work and the party rectification work in 2.7 million of the more than 3 million people in the entire region. On the other hand, the Jin-Sui Party also corrected several left-leaning deviations that occurred in the movement, thus putting all the work on a healthy development track. From these two aspects, I believe that the land reform work and the party rectification work in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area have been successful.

"From now on, we will never dare to be feudal again, never dare to be fierce again, and never dare to be corrupt again." These are the words of the Jin-Sui people. This is the conclusion made by the Jin-Sui people on our land reform work and party rectification work. They said: "Never dare to be feudal again," which means that we led them to launch a struggle to eliminate or are eliminating the feudal exploitation system in the new areas and the remnants of the feudal exploitation system in the old and semi-old areas. They said: "Never dare to be fierce again, and never dare to be corrupt again," which means that within the organizations of our party and government, there were serious phenomena of impurity in composition or impurity in work style to some extent in the past. Many bad elements infiltrated the organizations of the party and government, and many people developed bureaucratic work styles, bullying others, and using coercive methods to complete work tasks, thus causing dissatisfaction among the masses; or committed corruption crimes; or encroached on the interests of the masses. These situations have been fundamentally changed through the land reform work and party rectification work in the past year.

Or someone said: "What was fatal to us in the past has now been removed, and what we didn't have in the past, we have now." This was said to me by a comrade among you. The fatal things he mentioned refer to the serious phenomena of impurity in composition or impurity in work style existing in the party and government organizations and thus causing dissatisfaction among the masses. This phenomenon has now been fundamentally removed. The things that he said were not there in the past but are there now refer to the poor peasant leagues, the new peasant associations, the district and village people's representative conferences, and the completely new atmosphere in the countryside created by the land reform work and the party rectification work.

I think these reflections are in line with the actual situation.

This is the great success of the land reform work and the party rectification work in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area. This is the first aspect of success. On this basis, the Jin-Sui Party was able to complete huge military service in the past year and support the great people's revolutionary war. If there had been no successful land reform work and party rectification work, it would have been difficult to complete such a large military task.

On the other hand, the Jin-Sui Party corrected several left-leaning deviations that occurred in the work. These are mainly three deviations. First, in the division of class components, in many places, many working people who had no feudal exploitation or only slight exploitation were mistakenly classified into the circle of landlords and rich peasants. The scope of attack was wrongly expanded, and we forgot that in the land reform work, we could and must unite about 92 percent of the households and about 90 percent of the people in the rural areas, that is, all the rural working people, and establish a united front against the feudal system, which is an extremely important strategic policy. Now, this deviation has been corrected. In this way, people's hearts have been greatly stabilized and the revolutionary united front has been consolidated. Second, in the land reform work, the industry and commerce belonging to landlords and rich peasants were infringed upon; in the struggle to investigate economic counter-revolutionaries, the scope that should be investigated was exceeded; and in the tax policy, industry and commerce were attacked. These all belong to the left-leaning deviations in dealing with industry and commerce, and they have now been corrected, so that industry and commerce have the possibility of recovery and development. Third, in the past year of fierce land reform struggle, the Jin-Sui Party was unable to clearly adhere to our party's policy of strictly prohibiting indiscriminate beatings and killings, so that in some places, some landlord and rich peasant elements were unnecessarily executed in the land reform; and the bad elements in the countryside were given the opportunity to retaliate, and they sinfully killed some working people; we believe that through the people's court and the democratic government, it is completely necessary and proper to sentence to death those important criminals who actively and seriously oppose the people's democratic revolution and sabotage the land reform work, that is, those counter-revolutionary elements and local tyrants who have committed heinous crimes. Otherwise, a democratic order cannot be established. However, it is necessary to prohibit indiscriminate killings for all ordinary personnel on the Kuomintang side, general landlord and rich peasant elements, or elements who have committed minor crimes. At the same time, it is necessary to prohibit the use of torture when the people's court and the democratic government conduct the trial of criminals. In the past year, the Jin-Sui's deviation in this regard has now been corrected.

After earnestly correcting all the above-mentioned deviations, we have reason to say that all the work under the leadership of the Jin-Sui Central Sub-Bureau has now embarked on a path of healthy development.

Deciding the work policy according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all communists must firmly remember. The mistakes we have made, when studying the reasons for their occurrence, are all because we have deviated from the actual situation at that time and place and subjectively decided our work policy. This should be taken as a lesson for all comrades.

Regarding the work of consolidating the party's grass-roots organizations, you have adopted the experience of party rectification in Pingshan County, Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area, according to the central government's instructions on carrying out land reform and party rectification work in the old and semi-old areas, that is, inviting non-party masses to participate in the party branch meetings, launching criticism and self-criticism, so as to change the phenomenon of impurity in the composition of the party organizations or impurity in the work style, and closely link the party with the masses of the people. By doing so, you will be able to complete the entire work of consolidating the party organizations in a sound manner.

Party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated and those who are hopeless, regardless of their origin, should be educated rather than abandoned. You have implemented or are implementing this policy, which is also correct.

In the struggle against the feudal system, the people's representative conferences at the district and village (township) levels established on the basis of the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations are an extremely valuable experience. Only the people's representative conferences established based on the will of the truly broad masses are truly the people's representative conferences. Such people's representative conferences are now possible to appear in all liberated areas. Once such a people's representative conference is established, it should become the highest organ of power in the local area, and all power should belong to the representative conference and the government committee elected by it. At that time, the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations will become their assistants. We once planned to establish people's representative conferences in rural areas after their land reform tasks were largely completed. Now that your experience and the experience of some liberated areas in North China have proved that it is possible and necessary to establish people's representative conferences at the district and village levels and the government committees elected by them during the land reform struggle, then you should do so. This should also be done in all liberated areas. When the people's representative conferences at the district and village levels are universally established, the people's representative conference at the county level can be established. With the people's representative conferences at the county level and below, it will be easy to establish the people's representative conferences at the county level and above. In the people's representative conferences at all levels, all democratic classes, including workers, peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, free industrialists and businessmen, and enlightened gentry, must have their representatives participate as much as possible. Of course, it is not to make up the number forcibly, but to realize the task of uniting all democratic classes naturally rather than forcibly, by distinguishing between rural areas with towns and rural areas without towns, distinguishing between the size of towns, and distinguishing between cities and rural areas.

In the great mass struggle of land reform and party rectification, tens of thousands of activists and working cadres have been educated and produced. They are in contact with the masses, and they are extremely valuable wealth of the People's Republic of China. In the future, their education should be strengthened so that they can continue to make progress in their work. At the same time, they should be warned that they must not be proud and complacent because of success or because of being rewarded.

Because of all this, because of the success in the above-mentioned aspects, it should be said that the Jin-Sui Liberated Area is now more consolidated than ever before. In other liberated areas, those who have done this have also been equally consolidated.

(2) The reason why the Jin-Sui Liberated Area has achieved the above-mentioned success is mainly, from the leadership point of view: (A) With the face-to-face instructions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi in the spring of last year and the help of Comrade Kang Sheng's work in Haojiapo Administrative Village, Linxian County in the spring and summer of last year, the Jin-Sui Central Sub-Bureau convened a meeting of prefectural committee secretaries in June last year. At this meeting, the right-leaning tendencies existing in the past work were criticized, various serious phenomena deviating from the party's line were thoroughly exposed, and the policy of earnestly launching land reform work and party rectification work was decided. This meeting was basically successful. Without this meeting, the success of such a large-scale land reform work and party rectification work would have been impossible. The shortcomings of this meeting are: it did not decide different work policies according to the different situations of the old and semi-old areas and the new areas; it adopted an overly left-leaning policy on the issue of dividing class components; it paid too much attention to investigating the land properties of landlords in the issue of how to eliminate the feudal system; and it lacked a clear analysis of the masses' demands and put forward the slogan of "do whatever the masses want to do" in general terms. Regarding this latter issue, that is, the issue of the relationship between the party and the masses, it should be: the party must lead the masses to realize the correct opinions of the people's masses according to the situation; and for the incorrect opinions that occur among the people's masses, the masses must be educated to correct them. The land secretary meeting only emphasized the aspect that the party should implement the masses' opinions, and ignored the aspect that the party should educate and lead the masses, so that it gave the comrades who worked in certain regions later an incorrect influence to commit tailism errors. (B) The Jin-Sui Central Sub-Bureau took appropriate steps to correct the left-leaning tendencies in January this year. This step was implemented after the comrades of the sub-bureau returned from participating in the Central December meeting. The sub-bureau issued five instructions for this purpose. This step of correcting deviations is so in line with the requirements of the masses, and so rapid and thorough, that almost all left-leaning deviations have been corrected in a short period of time.

(3) The leadership line of the Jin-Sui Party during the Anti-Japanese War was basically correct. This is manifested in the implementation of rent and interest reduction, the considerable restoration and development of agricultural production and household textile industry, military industry and a part of light industry, the establishment of the party's foundation, the establishment of a democratic government, and the establishment of a people's army of nearly 100,000 people, so that it was able to rely on these works as a foundation to carry out the victorious Anti-Japanese War and repel the attacks of the reactionaries such as Yan Xishan and Fu Zuoyi. Of course, the party and government during this period had shortcomings, that is, what we now fully understand is their impurity in composition or impurity in work style to some extent, and the many adverse phenomena in work arising therefrom. However, generally speaking, the work during the Anti-Japanese War was successful. This gave us favorable conditions on which to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary offensive after Japan surrendered. The shortcomings or errors of the Jin-Sui Party's leadership during the Anti-Japanese War were mainly that it failed to rely on the broadest masses to overcome the impurity in composition or impurity in work style to some extent within the party and government, and the adverse phenomena in work arising therefrom, and left this task to you to complete until now. The lack of understanding of the many real situations of the party and the masses by certain leading comrades of the Jin-Sui Party at that time was one of the reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena. This is also a lesson that comrades should learn.

(4) The tasks of the Jin-Sui Party in the future are to continue to complete the land reform work and the party rectification work with great efforts, continue to develop and support the people's revolutionary war, no longer increase the burden on the people, and appropriately reduce the burden on the people, and restore and develop production. You are now holding a production conference. Restoring and developing production are the ultimate goals of all our revolutionary work. In the next few years, the purpose of restoring and developing production is to improve the people's lives on the one hand, and to support the people's revolutionary war on the other hand. You have vast agriculture and handicrafts, as well as a part of light and heavy industry using machines. I hope you will lead these production undertakings well, otherwise you cannot be regarded as a good Marxist. In agriculture, those mutual aid teams and cooperatives that were controlled by bureaucratic elements and were harmful and useless to the people's masses have collapsed, which is completely understandable and not at all regrettable. Your task is to carefully preserve and develop those mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and other necessary economic organizations that are supported by the people's masses, and to promote such organizations to all regions.

(5) The national situation is what comrades are concerned about. Since the party's national land conference last year decided to adopt a new policy and launch land reform work and party rectification work, almost all liberated areas have convened large cadre meetings related to party rectification and land reform, criticized the right-leaning thinking existing in the party, and exposed the serious phenomena of impurity in composition or impurity in work style existing in the party to some extent. And later, in many regions, steps were taken to correct or are being taken to correct the left-leaning deviations. In this way, our party's work throughout the country has embarked on a healthy development track under the new political situation and political tasks. Almost all the People's Liberation Army has used the gaps in the war to carry out large-scale consolidation and training in recent months. This consolidation and training was carried out in a completely led and completely orderly manner using democratic methods. As a result, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commanders and fighters was stimulated, the purpose of the war was clearly understood, some incorrect ideological tendencies and adverse phenomena existing in the army were eliminated, cadres and soldiers were educated, and combat effectiveness was greatly improved. This democratic, mass-based, new-style army consolidation movement must be continued in the future. You can clearly see that our enemy, the Kuomintang, cannot implement the party rectification, army consolidation, and land reform work that we have implemented with great historical significance. On our side, we are so earnestly correcting our own shortcomings, uniting our entire party and army almost like one person, closely combining the entire party and army with the masses of the people, effectively implementing all the policies and strategies stipulated by our party Central Committee, and victoriously carrying out the people's revolutionary war. On the side of our enemy, everything is the opposite. They are so corrupt, so increasingly numerous and unsolvable internal disputes, so spurned by the people and falling into complete isolation, and have suffered so many defeats, so they are inevitably heading for destruction. This is the entire situation of the mutual comparison between the two parties and two armies of the Chinese revolution and counter-revolution.

Under this situation, all comrades must firmly grasp the party's general line, which is the line of the new democratic revolution. The new democratic revolution is not any other revolution, it can only and must be a revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This means that this revolution cannot be led by any other class or any other political party, it can only and must be led by the proletariat and the Chinese Communist Party. This means that the united front composed of the people participating in this revolution is very broad, including workers, peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry split from the landlord class, this is what we call the masses of the people. The country and government established by this mass of the people are the People's Republic of China and the democratic coalition government representing the joint dictatorship of various democratic classes. The enemies that this revolution wants to overthrow are only and must be imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The concentrated manifestation of these enemies is the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang.

Feudalism is an ally of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism and the foundation of their rule. Therefore, the reform of the land system is the main content of the Chinese new democratic revolution. The general line of land reform is to rely on the poor peasants, unite the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction, and develop agricultural production. The force that land reform relies on can only and must be the poor peasants. This class of poor peasants, together with the farm laborers, accounts for about 70 percent of the rural population in China. The main task of land reform is to satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasant masses. Land reform must unite the middle peasants, and the poor and hired peasants must form a solid united front with the middle peasants, who account for about 20 percent of the rural population. Without doing so, the poor and hired peasants will be isolated and the land reform will fail. One of the tasks of land reform is to satisfy the demands of some middle peasants. It must be allowed that some middle peasants retain a higher amount of land than the average level of land obtained by ordinary poor peasants. We support the peasants' demand for equal distribution of land in order to facilitate the mobilization of the broad masses of peasants to quickly eliminate the land ownership system of the feudal landlord class, not to advocate absolute egalitarianism. Anyone who advocates absolute egalitarianism is wrong. The idea of destroying industry and commerce and advocating absolute egalitarianism in the distribution of land, which is popular in rural areas now, is an agricultural socialist idea. The nature of this idea is reactionary, backward, and regressive, and we must criticize this idea. The target of land reform is only and must be the feudal exploitation system of the landlord class and the old-style rich peasants, it cannot infringe on the free bourgeoisie, nor should it infringe on the industry and commerce run by landlords and rich peasants, and pay special attention not to infringe on the middle peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, and new-style rich peasants who have no exploitation or only slight exploitation. The purpose of land reform is to eliminate the feudal exploitation system, that is, to eliminate the feudal landlords as a class, not to eliminate the landlords as individuals. Therefore, landlords must be given the same land property as the peasants and made to learn labor production and participate in the ranks of national economic life. Except for those counter-revolutionary elements and local tyrants who have committed heinous crimes that have been verified and are hated by the broad masses of people, who can and should be punished, a lenient policy must be implemented towards everyone, and any indiscriminate beating and killing is prohibited. The elimination of the feudal exploitation system should be step by step, that is, tactical. The strategy of launching the struggle must be determined according to the circumstances permitted by the environment, the degree of awakening and organization of the peasant masses, and do not attempt to eliminate the entire feudal exploitation system in one morning. The overall scope of attack of land reform, according to the actual situation of the feudal exploitation system in rural China, generally cannot exceed about 8 percent of the rural households and about 10 percent of the population. And in the old and semi-old liberated areas, this number should be reduced. It is dangerous to mistakenly expand the scope of attack by deviating from the actual situation. In the new areas, it is also necessary to divide the regions and stages. Dividing the regions means that we should concentrate our efforts on carrying out appropriate land reform work that meets the requirements of the local masses in those areas that can be firmly occupied; and in those areas that are temporarily difficult to firmly occupy, do not rush to carry out land reform work, but only do some work that can be done and is conducive to the masses according to the current situation, pending changes in the situation. Dividing the stages means that in the areas just occupied by the People's Liberation Army, we should put forward and implement the strategy of neutralizing rich peasants and small and medium landlords, narrowing the scope of attack to only eliminating the Kuomintang's reactionary armed forces and attacking local tyrants and bullies, and concentrate all our efforts to complete this task as the first stage of work in the new area. Then, according to the situation where the degree of awakening and organization of the masses is improved, gradually develop to the stage of eliminating the entire feudal system. In the new areas, both dividing the floating property and dividing the land must be done after the environment is relatively stable and the vast majority of the masses are fully mobilized, otherwise it is adventurous, unreliable, and harmful and useless. In the new areas, we must make full use of the experience during the Anti-Japanese War. The so-called eliminating the feudal system with distinction means that we must distinguish between landlords and rich peasants, distinguish between the large, medium, and small landlords, distinguish between the evil bullies and non-evil bullies among the landlords and rich peasants, and under the general principle of equally dividing the land and eliminating the feudal system, we must not decide and implement the treatment of these people with different circumstances to varying degrees not uniformly but with distinction. When we have done this, people will feel that our work is completely reasonable. Developing agricultural production is the direct purpose of land reform. Only by eliminating the feudal system can we obtain the conditions for developing agricultural production. In any region, once the feudal system is eliminated and the task of land reform is completed, the party and the democratic government must immediately put forward the task of restoring and developing agricultural production, transfer all possible forces in the rural areas to the aspect of restoring and developing agricultural production, organize cooperation and mutual assistance, improve agricultural technology, improve seeds, build water conservancy, and strive to make increased production possible. The largest part of the rural party's energy must be placed on restoring and developing agricultural production and industrial production in towns. In order to quickly restore and develop agricultural production and industrial production in towns, in the struggle to eliminate the feudal system, we must pay attention to making every effort to maximize the preservation of all available means of production and means of livelihood, and take measures to resolutely oppose anyone's destruction and waste of means of production and means of livelihood, oppose eating and drinking extravagantly, and pay attention to thrift. In order to develop agricultural production, we must persuade the peasants to gradually organize themselves into various cooperative organizations for production and consumption based on private ownership, which are permitted by the current economic conditions, under the principle of voluntariness. Eliminating the feudal system and Developing agricultural production lays the foundation for the task of developing industrial production and transforming agricultural countries into industrial countries, which is the final goal of the new democratic revolution.

Comrades know that our party has stipulated the general line and general policy of the Chinese revolution, and also stipulated the specific work lines and specific policies. But many comrades often remember the specific individual work lines and policies of our party, and forget the general line and general policy of our party. If we really forget the general line and general policy of our party, we will be a blind, incomplete, and unclear revolutionary, and we will lose our way, swing left and right, and delay our work when we implement specific work lines and specific policies.

Let me say it again.

"The revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism" is the new democratic revolution in China, which is the general line and general policy of the Chinese Communist Party in the current historical stage.

"Rely on the poor peasants, unite the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction, and develop agricultural production" is the general line and general policy of the Chinese Communist Party in the new democratic revolution period and in the land reform work. (End)

### 在晋绥干部会议上的讲话
毛泽东

专栏：

　　在晋绥干部会议上的讲话
    （一九四八年四月一日）
    同志们！今天我想讲的，主要的是一些和晋绥工作有关的问题，然后讲到一些和全国工作有关的问题。
    （一）我认为过去一年内，在晋绥分局领导区域内的土地改革工作和整党工作是成功的。
    这是从两方面来看的。一方面，晋绥党反对了右的偏向，发动了群众斗争，在全区三百多万人口的二百几十万人口中，完成了或者正在完成着土地改革工作和整党工作。另一方面，晋绥党又纠正了在运动中发生的几个左的偏向，因而使全部工作走上了健全发展的轨道。从这两方面来看，晋绥解放区的土地改革工作和整党工作，我认为是成功的。
    “从此以后，再也不敢封建了，再也不敢厉害了，再也不敢贪污了”。这是晋绥人民的话。这是晋绥人民对于我们的土地改革工作和整党工作所做的结论。他们说：“再也不敢封建了”，就是说，我们领导他们发动了斗争，消灭了或者正在消灭着新区的封建剥削制度和老区半老区的封建剥削制度的残余。他们说：“再也不敢厉害了，再也不敢贪污了”，就是说，在我们的党和政府的组织内，过去存在着某种程度上的成份不纯或者作风不纯的严重现象，许多坏分子混入了党和政府的组织内，许多人发展了官僚主义作风，仗势欺人，用强迫命令的方法去完成工作任务，因而引起群众不满；或者犯了贪污罪；或者侵占了群众的利益。这些情况，经过过去一年的土地改革工作和整党工作，已经从根本上改变了。
    或者说：“过去对于我们是致命的东西，现在去掉了，过去没有的东西，现在有了。”这是在座同志们中有一位同志对我说的。他所说的致命的东西，就是指的存在于党和政府组织内的成份不纯或作风不纯并因而引起群众不满的严重现象。这种现象，现在是根本上去掉了。他所说的过去没有而现在有了的东西，就是指的贫农团、新农会、区村人民代表会议，以及由于土地改革工作和整党工作所造成的农村中面目一新的气象。
    这些反映，我以为是合乎实际的。
    这就是晋绥解放区的土地改革工作和整党工作的伟大的成功。这是成功的第一个方面。在这个基础上，使得晋绥党能够在过去一年内完成了巨大的军事勤务，支援了伟大的人民革命战争。假使没有成功的土地改革工作和整党工作，要完成这样大的军事任务，那是困难的。
    另一方面，晋绥党纠正了在工作中发生的几个左的偏向。这主要地是三个偏向。第一、在划分阶级成份中，在许多地方把许多并无封建剥削或者只有轻微剥削的劳动人民错误地划到地主富农圈子里去。错误地扩大了打击面，忘记了我们在土地改革工作中可能和必须团结农村中户数百分之九十二左右，人数百分之九十左右，即全体农村劳动人民，建立反对封建制度的统一战线这样一个极端重要的战略方针。现在，这项偏向已经纠正了。这样，就大大地安定了人心，巩固了革命统一战线。第二、是在土地改革工作中侵犯了属于地主富农所有的工商业；在清查经济反革命的斗争中，超出了应当清查的范围；以及在税收政策中，打击了工商业。这些，都是属于对待工商业方面的左的偏向，现在也已纠正，使工商业获得了恢复和发展的可能。第三、在过去一年的激烈的土地改革斗争中，晋绥党没有能够明确地坚持我党严禁乱打乱杀的方针，以致于在某些地方的土地改革中不必要地处死了一些地主富农分子；并给农村中的坏分子以乘机报复的可能，由他们罪恶地杀死了若干劳动人民；我们认为经过人民法庭和民主政府，对于那些积极地并严重地反对人民民主革命和破坏土地改革工作的重要的犯罪分子，即那些罪大恶极的反革命分子和恶霸分子，判处死刑，是完全必要和正当的，不如此，就不能建立民主秩序。但是，对于一切站在国民党方面的普通人员，一般的地主富农分子，或犯罪较轻的分子，则必须禁止乱杀。同时，在人民法庭及民主政府进行对于犯罪分子的审讯工作时，必须禁止使用肉刑。过去一年中，晋绥在这方面曾经发生的偏向，现在也已纠正了。
    在认真纠正了上述一切偏向之后，使得我们有根据的来说，晋绥中央分局领导下面的全部工作，现在已经走上了健全发展的道路。
    按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。我们所犯的错误，研究其发生的原因，都是由于我们离开了当时当地的实际情况，主观地决定自己的工作方针。这一点，应当引为全体同志的教训。
    关于整理党的基层组织的工作，你们已经根据中央关于在老区半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示，采用晋察冀解放区平山县的整党经验，即是邀集党外群众参加党的支部会议，展开批评和自我批评，借以改变党的组织的成份不纯或者作风不纯的现象，使党和人民群众密切地联系起来。你们这样做，将使你们有可能健全地完成对于党的组织的全部整理工作。
    对于那些犯了错误，但是还可以教育的和那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们。你们已经执行了或者正在执行着这个方针，这也是对的。
    在反对封建制度的斗争中，在贫农团和农会的基础上建立起来的区村（乡）两级人民代表会议，是一项极可宝贵的经验。只有基于真正广大群众的意志建立起来的人民代表会议，才是真正的人民代表会议。这样的人民代表会议，现在已有可能在一切解放区出现。这样的人民代表会议一经建立，它就应当成为当地的最高权力机关，一切权力应当归于代表会议及其选出的政府委员会。到了那时，贫农团和农会就成为它们的助手。我们曾经打算在各地农村中，在其土地改革任务大致完成以后再去建立人民代表会议。现在你们的经验以及华北某些解放区的经验，既已证明就在土地改革斗争当中建立区村两级人民代表会议及其选出的政府委员会，是可能的和必要的，那么，你们就应当这样做。在一切解放区，也就应当这样做。在区村两级人民代表会议普遍地建立起来的时候，就可以建立县一级的人民代表会议。有了县和县以下各级的人民代表会议，县以上的各级人民代表会议就容易建立起来了。在各级人民代表会议中，必须使一切民主阶层，包括工人、农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由工商业者及开明绅士，尽可能地都有他们的代表参加进去。当然不是勉强凑数，而是要分别有市镇的农村和没有市镇的农村，分别市镇的大小，分别城市和农村，自然的而不是勉强地实现这个联合一切民主阶层的任务。
    在土地改革和整党的伟大的群众斗争中，教育了和产生了成万的积极分子和工作干部。他们是联系群众的，他们是中华人民共和国的极可宝贵的财富。今后应当加强对于他们的教育，使他们在工作中不断地获得进步。同时，应当向他们提出警告，决不可以因为成功，因为受到奖励而骄傲自满。
    由于这一切，由于上述各方面的成功，应当说，晋绥解放区现在是比过去任何时候更加巩固了。在其他解放区，凡是这样做了的，也就同样地巩固了。
    （二）晋绥解放区获得上述成功的原因，就领导方面来说，主要的是：（甲）在去年春季刘少奇同志的当面指示和去年春夏康生同志在临县郝家坡行政村的工作的帮助之下，晋绥中央分局在去年六月召开了地委书记会议。在这个会议上，批判了过去工作中存在着的右的偏向，彻底地揭发了各种离开党的路线的严重现象，决定了认真地发动土地改革工作和整党工作的方针。这个会议是基本上成功的。假如没有这个会议，这样大的土地改革工作和整党工作的成功是不可能的。这个会议的缺点是：没有按照老区半老区和新区的不同的情况决定不同的工作方针；在划分阶级成份的问题上采取了过左的方针；在如何消灭封建制度的问题上太注重了清查地主的地财，以及在对待群众要求的问题上缺乏清醒的分析，笼统地提出了“群众要怎样办就怎样办”的口号。关于这后一个问题，即党和群众的关系的问题，应当是：凡属人民群众的正确的意见，党必须依据情况领导群众予以实现；而对于人民群众中发生的不正确的意见，则必须教育群众予以改正。地书会议仅仅强调了党应当执行群众意见的方面，而忽视了党应当教育群众和领导群众的方面，以致给了后来某些地区的工作同志犯尾巴主义错误以不正确的影响。（乙）晋绥中央分局在今年一月采取了纠正左的偏向的适当步骤。这个步骤是在分局同志参加中央十二月会议回来以后实行的。分局为此发出了五项指示。这一纠正偏向的步骤，如此适合群众的要求，又如此迅速和贯彻，在短时期内，几乎一切左的偏向都已纠正过来了。
    （三）晋绥党在抗日时期的领导路线，是基本上正确的。这表现在实行了减租减息，相当地恢复和发展了农业生产和家庭纺织业，军事工业和一部分轻工业，建立了党的基础，建立了民主政府，建立了近十万人的人民军队，因而就能依据这些工作作基础，进行了胜利的抗日战争，并打退了阎锡山、傅作义等反动派的进攻。当然，这个时期的党和政府是有缺点的，这就是现在我们已经完全明白的它们的在某种程度上的成份不纯或者作风不纯，以及由此产生的许多工作上的不良现象。但是，就总的情形说来，抗日时期的工作是有成绩的。这就给我们在日本投降以后能够据以打败蒋介石的反革命进攻的有利条件。抗日时期，晋绥党的领导方面的缺点或错误，主要地是未能依靠最广大的群众克服党内和政府内在某种程度上的成份不纯，或者作风不纯，以及由此产生的工作中的不良现象，而将这个任务留给了你们到现在来完成。那时的晋绥党的某些领导同志，缺乏对于党和群众的许多真实情况的了解，是造成上述现象的原因之一。这一点，也是同志们应当引为教训的。
    （四）今后晋绥党的任务，是用极大努力，继续完成土地改革工作和整党工作，继续发展和支援人民革命战争，不再加重民负，并酌量减轻民负，恢复和发展生产。你们现在正在开生产会议。恢复和发展生产是我们一切革命工作的终极目的。在目前数年内，恢复和发展生产的目的是一方面改善人民的生活，同时，支援人民的革命战争。你们有广大的农业和手工业，也有一部分使用机器的轻工业和重工业。希望你们好好地领导这些生产事业，否则就不能算作一个好的马克思主义者。在农业方面，过去被官僚主义分子所把持的、对于人民群众有害无益的那些变工队和合作社都垮台了，这是完全可以理解的，并且是毫不可惜的。你们的任务，是在于细心地保存和发展那些为人民群众所拥护的变工队、合作社和其他必要的经济组织，并推广这样的组织于各地。
    （五）全国形势，是同志们所关心的。自从去年党的全国土地会议决定采取新方针，展开土地改革工作和整党工作以后，差不多在一切解放区都召开了有关整党和土地改革的大的干部会议，批判了存在于党内的右倾思想，揭发了党内在某种程度上存在着的成份不纯或者作风不纯的严重现象。而在以后，在许多地区，又采取步骤，纠正了或者正在纠正着左的偏向。这样，就使我党在全国的工作，在新的政治形势和政治任务之下，走上了健全发展的轨道。差不多一切人民解放军，在最近几个月内，都利用了战争的空隙实行了大规模的整训。这种整训，是完全有领导地和完全有秩序地采用民主方法进行的。由此，激发了广大的指挥员和战斗员群众的革命热情，明确地认识了战争目的，清除了存在于军队中的若干不正确的思想上的倾向和不良现象，教育了干部和战士，极大地提高了战斗力。这种民主的群众性的新式的整军运动，今后必须继续进行。你们可以清楚的看见，我们所实行的具有伟大历史意义的整党、整军和土地改革工作，我们的敌人国民党是一样也不能实行的。在我们方面，是如此认真地纠正自己的缺点，把我们的全党全军团结的差不多象一个人一样，使全党全军和人民群众密切地结合起来，有效地执行着我党中央所规定的一切政策和策略，胜利地进行着人民的革命战争。在我们的敌人方面，则一切相反。他们是那样腐化，那样日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，打了那样多的败仗，因此他们就是必不可免地走向灭亡。这就是中国革命和反革命的两党两军互相对比的全部形势。
    在这种形势下面，全党同志必须紧紧地掌握党的总路线，这就是新民主主义革命的路线。新民主主义的革命，不是任何别的革命，它只能是和必须是无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命。这就是说，这个革命不能由任何别的阶级和任何别的政党充当领导者，只能和必须由无产阶级和中国共产党充当领导者。这就是说，由参加这个革命的人们所组成的统一战线是十分广大的，这里包括了工人、农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级以及从地主阶级分裂出来的开明绅士，这就是我们所说的人民大众。由这个人民大众所建立的国家及政府，就是中华人民民主共和国及代表各民主阶级联合专政的民主联合政府。这个革命所要推翻的敌人，只是和必须是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。这些敌人的集中表现，就是蒋介石国民党的反动统治。
    封建主义是帝国主义和官僚资本主义的同盟者及其统治的基础。因此，土地制度的改革，是中国新民主主义革命的主要内容。土地改革的总路线，是依靠贫农，团结中农，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产。土地改革所依靠的力量，只能和必须是贫农。这个贫农阶层，和雇农在一起，占了中国农村人口的百分之七十左右。土地改革的主要任务，就是满足贫雇农群众的要求。土地改革必须团结中农，贫雇农必须和占农村人口百分之二十左右的中农结成巩固的统一战线。不这样做，贫雇农就会陷于孤立，土地改革就会失败。土地改革的一个任务，是满足某些中农的要求。必须容许一部分中农保有比较一般贫农所得土地的平均水平为高的土地量。我们赞助农民平分土地的要求，是为了便于发动广大的农民群众迅速地消灭封建地主阶级的土地所有制度，并非提倡绝对平均主义。谁要是提倡绝对平均主义，那就是错误的。现在农村中流行的一种破坏工商业，在分配土地问题上主张绝对平均主义的思想，是一种农业社会主义的思想。这种思想的性质是反动的，落后的，倒退的，我们必须批判这种思想。土地改革的对象，只是和必须是地主阶级和旧式富农的封建剥削制度，不能侵犯自由资产阶级，也不要侵犯地主富农所经营的工商业，特别注意不要侵犯没有剥削或者只有轻微剥削的中农、独立劳动者、自由职业者和新式富农。土地改革的目的是消灭封建剥削制度，即消灭封建地主之为阶级，而不是消灭地主个人。因此，对地主必须分给和农民同样的土地财产，并使他们学会劳动生产参加国民经济生活的行列。除了可以和应当惩办那些为广大人民群众所痛恨的查有实据的罪大恶极的反革命分子和恶霸分子以外，必须实行对一切人的宽大政策，禁止任何的乱打乱杀。消灭封建剥削制度应当是有步骤的，即是说，有策略的。必须依据环境所许可的情况，农民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度，决定发动斗争的策略，不要企图在一个早上消灭全部的封建剥削制度。土地改革的总的打击面，根据中国农村封建剥削制度的实际情况，一般地不能超过农村户数百分之八左右，人数百分之十左右的数目。而在老的及半老的解放区内，此项数目还要减少。离开实际情况，错误地扩大打击面，是危险的。在新区，还必须分地区，分阶段。分地区，是说应当集中力量在那些可以巩固地占领的区域进行适当的合乎当地群众要求的土地改革工作；而在那些暂时尚难巩固地占领的区域，则不要忙于进行土地改革工作，而只做一些可以做的，按照当前情况有利于群众的工作，以待情况之变化。分阶段，是说在人民解放军刚才占领的区域，应当提出和实行中立富农和中小地主的策略，将打击面缩小到只消灭国民党的反动武装，打击豪绅恶霸分子，集中一切力量去完成这个任务，作为新区工作的第一个阶段。然后，依据群众的觉悟程度和组织程度的被提高了的情况，逐步地发展到消灭全部封建制度的阶段。在新区，分浮财和分土地，均必须在环境比较安定和绝大多数群众充分发动之后，否则就是冒险的，靠不住的，有害无益的。在新区，必须充分利用抗日时期的经验。所谓有分别地消灭封建制度，就是说必须分别地主和富农，分别地主的大中小，分别地主富农中的恶霸分子和非恶霸分子，在平分土地、消灭封建制度的大原则下面，不是一律地而是有所分别地决定和实行给予这些不同情况的人们以不同程度的待遇。在我们这样做了的时候，人们就会感觉，我们的工作是完全合乎情理的。发展农业生产，是土地改革的直接目的。只有消灭封建制度，才能取得发展农业生产的条件。在任何地区，一经消灭了封建制度，完成了土地改革任务，党和民主政府就必须立即提出恢复和发展农业生产的任务，将农村中的一切可能的力量转移到恢复和发展农业生产的方面去，组织合作互助，改良农业技术，改良种子，兴办水利，务使增产成为可能。农村党的精力的最大部分，必须放在恢复和发展农业生产及市镇上的工业生产上面。为了迅速地恢复和发展农业生产及市镇上的工业生产，在消灭封建制度的斗争中，必须注意尽一切努力最大限度地保存一切可用的生产资料和生活资料，采取办法坚决地反对任何人对于生产资料和生活资料的破坏和浪费，反对大吃大喝，注意节约。为了发展农业生产，必须劝告农民在自愿原则下逐步地组织为现时经济条件所许可的以私有制为基础的各种生产的和消费的合作团体。消灭封建制度，发展农业生产，就给发展工业生产，变农业国为工业国的任务奠定了基础，这就是新民主主义革命的最后目的。
    同志们知道，我党规定了中国革命的总路线和总政策，又规定了各项具体的工作路线和各项具体的政策。但是许多同志往往记住了我党的具体的个别的工作路线和政策，忘记了我党的总路线和总政策。而如果真正忘记了我党的总路线和总政策，我们就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，在我们执行具体工作路线和具体政策的时候，就会迷失方向，就会发生左右摇摆，就会遗误我们的工作。
    让我再说一遍。
    “无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命”，这就是中国的新民主主义的革命，这就是中国共产党的当前历史阶段的总路线和总政策。
    “依靠贫农、团结中农，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产”，这就是中国共产党在新民主主义革命时期、在土地改革工作中的总路线和总政策。　　　　　　　　（完）
