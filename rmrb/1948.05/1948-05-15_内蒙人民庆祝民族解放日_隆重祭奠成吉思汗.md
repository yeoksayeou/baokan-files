Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: April 29th is the anniversary of Genghis Khan's victory over the ancestral enemy, the Tatars, and the achievement of national unification (formerly mistakenly regarded as Genghis Khan's birthday). The Inner Mongolia Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Autonomous Government, and representatives from various agencies in Ulanhot (i.e., Wangye Temple), numbering in the hundreds, solemnly commemorated Genghis Khan on that day. Lin Seleng, a respected elder of the Bayantala League in his seventies, also made a special trip to participate. The sacrificial altar and both sides of the venue were covered with memorial couplets and slogans, calling for the promotion of the solidarity of the Mongolian people, the overthrow of the Han chauvinist Chiang Kai-shek. Hafunga, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, presided over the ceremony, offering incense and reading the memorial text, then delivered a speech saying: "Genghis Khan unified the Mongolian people, created a glorious history, and raised the national status. However, later Inner Mongolia suffered more than three hundred years of national oppression, until the 'April 3rd' Conference in 1946 and the establishment of the Autonomous Government in 1947, when the unprecedented democratic unity of the Inner Mongolian people was realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Yun Ze. Currently, land reform has been carried out in vast areas of Inner Mongolia, democracy has been realized, and they have participated in the revolutionary war to liberate all of China. Today, in commemorating Genghis Khan, we should inherit his national integrity of unyielding resistance to the enemy and the heroic tradition of defeating the enemy, concentrate all our efforts to annihilate the Han chauvinist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and liberate all of Inner Mongolia and all of China."

    内蒙人民庆祝民族解放日
    隆重祭奠成吉思汗
    【新华社东北十三日电】四月二十九日为成吉思汗战胜世仇大敌塔塔尔，获得全民族统一的胜利纪念日（前误为成吉思汗诞辰日）。中共内蒙党委与自治政府暨乌兰浩特市（即王爷庙）各机关代表数百人，于是日隆重祭奠成吉思汗。巴彦塔拉盟名绅七十老人林色楞亦亲自赶往参加。祭台及会场两侧遍悬祭联及标语，号召发扬蒙古民族团结，打倒大汉族主义者蒋介石，内蒙自治政府副主席哈丰阿主祭，献香爵读祭文后，致词说：“成吉思汗统一了蒙古民族，创造了光荣的历史，提高了民族地位。但后来内蒙古饱受了三百多年的民族压迫，直到一九四六年“四三”会议及一九四七年自治政府成立，才在中国共产党和云泽主席的领导下，实现了内蒙古人民民主的空前统一。目前内蒙广大地区都进行了土地改革，实现了民主，参加了解放全中国的革命战争。今天纪念成吉思汗应继承他对敌不屈的民族气节和战胜敌人的英勇传统，集中全力歼灭大汉族主义者蒋介石匪帮、解放全内蒙、全中国”。
