　　Psychological Warfare at Luanrenfen

　　The First Battalion of the 1317th Regiment of the Sixth Column, when besieging the enemy entrenched at Luanrenfen, seized the opportune moment to conduct frontline appeals, successfully persuading the 7th and 8th Companies of the Yan Xishan bandit's 29th Security Regiment to lay down their arms voluntarily. This is a brilliant victory achieved by our army in combining political offensives with military pressure during the battle to clear the enemy's outer defenses of Linfen.

　　Luanrenfen was a strongly fortified outer stronghold used by the enemy to defend the eastern gate of Linfen. In order to eliminate the obstacles to attacking the eastern gate, our army decided to take it down simultaneously with the attack on the electric company.

　　On the morning of March 24th, the two companies of enemy troops entrenched at Luanrenfen had already suffered casualties of over half their strength. At the same time, another part of our army had broken into the electric company and reached the city walls of the eastern gate, completely cutting off their contact with each other. In particular, the Yan Xishan bandits at the eastern gate forbade them from retreating into the city, leaving them in a completely desperate situation. Knowing this situation was very conducive to disintegrating the enemy, we immediately seized the opportunity and actively organized appeals, striving to persuade the enemy to lay down their weapons. The political instructor of the Second Company first aimed at the enemy's weakness of fearing that the soldiers would know about our army's capture of Yuncheng, asking them if they knew that our army had already captured Yuncheng. When the enemy had nothing to say, they fired their guns randomly. We still patiently carried out the appeals, directly pointing out their current dead end and the path to survival, and then told them about the victory of our army's spring offensive. In order to dispel the enemy's doubts, we put forward three guarantees: no killing of prisoners; no confiscation of personal belongings; those who want to stay can stay, those who don't want to can go home. At this time, the enemy fell silent. The comrade making the appeals then cleverly exposed his body outside the fortifications to shout, and the enemy did not fire. The battalion commander saw this situation and believed that the enemy was hesitating, and should quickly strengthen the appeals. So he reorganized an appeal group to conduct repeated appeals. At the same time, using heavy machine guns to block the road to the electric company, he immediately shouted to the enemy: "We have blocked your retreat, you can't go back, come over quickly, preferential treatment for prisoners!" At this time, the enemy was very flustered. One enemy soldier, Li Fugui, said in the bunker: "They are telling us to surrender!" Although everyone agreed, no one dared to say it. At that time, we also took down a small hidden bunker, capturing three enemies. Knowing that the enemy's battalion commander, company commander, and platoon leader were all wounded or killed, and there were no officers in charge, we arranged the content of the appeals according to this situation: "Your battalion commander and company commander are all wounded or killed, think about whether you want to die or live, those who want to live should come over, those who want to die can wait!" "You are soldiers captured by Yan Xishan's 'integration of soldiers and farmers', the 'integration of soldiers and farmers' just means not letting the people live!" The enemy replied: "We are willing to go over, but we don't know what you will do after we go over?" The enemy was still a bit doubtful about the guarantees we offered. The appeal group shouted for a day, and the enemy did not fire a single shot. The battalion commander and instructor personally went to shout, and the enemy said: "Shout quieter, don't let our officers hear." We immediately raised three guarantees based on this concern of the enemy, but the enemy was still uneasy and said: "You have to be conscientious!" A certain battalion commander believed that things were ripe and immediately stated his position: "I am the battalion commander, my name is ×××, my battalion is the one fighting you, if you lay down your arms, I guarantee your safety!" Then, he stipulated a password. The enemy said: "At night, you fire a grenade first, and we will fire a few grenades and come over." However, the comrades of the First Battalion were afraid that the enemy had a conspiracy, so they stipulated that we would send one person to the vicinity of the bunker, clapping as a signal. At night, Qin Liangyu, a communication soldier from the battalion headquarters, was sent to contact them. Before reaching the enemy's bunker, two enemy squad leaders shouted anxiously: "Quickly ask the battalion commander to send someone over, it will be too late if you wait any longer!" (Afraid that the officers would find out) Then another person was sent over, and both sides agreed to hand over weapons. The enemy then bundled up their guns and moved them out of the bunker. In this way, the two companies were successfully persuaded to lay down their arms.

　　乱人坟攻心战
    六大队一三一七部一营，对困守乱人坟的敌人，能抓住火候，进行火线喊话，争取了阎匪保警二九团七、八两连自动放下武器，这是我军在扫除临汾外围敌人的战斗中，实行政治攻势与军事压力相结合所取得的一个光辉的胜利。
    乱人坟是敌人保卫临汾东关一个强固设防的外围据点，我军为了扫除攻击东关的障碍，决定与攻击电灯公司同时，把它一齐打下来。
    三月二十四日早晨，据守乱人坟的两连敌人，已经被我打得伤亡过半了；同时，我军另一部分，又打进电灯公司和攻到东关的城垣，完全截断了他们互相之间的联系。特别是东关的阎匪，不准他们退入城内，使他们完全陷于绝望的境地。我们知道了这种非常利于瓦解敌人的情况，便马上抓紧时机，积极组织喊话，争取敌人放下武器，二连政指先就瞄准敌人害怕士兵知道运城被我打下的弱点对敌人喊话，问他们知道不知道我军已经打下了运城，敌人到了无话可说的时候就胡乱打枪。我们还是耐心地进行喊话，直接指出他们当前的死路和活路，随后又把我军春季攻势胜利消息也告诉了他们，为了解除敌人疑惑，提出三个保证：不杀俘虏；不没收私人东西；愿干的干，不愿干的回家。这时敌人不做声了，喊话同志又很机警地把身子露出工事喊，敌人也不打枪，营长看到这样情况，认为敌人是在犹疑，应赶快加强喊话，于是又重新组织了一个喊话组，进行反复的喊话。同时用重机枪封锁住电灯公司的道路，随即对敌人喊：“我们封住你们的后路，你们回不去了，快过来吧，优待俘虏！”这时，敌人很着慌，有一个敌士兵李富贵，在碉堡里说：“人家叫咱们投降呢！”大家虽都同意，就是没有人敢说。当时我又打下了一个小暗堡，俘敌三名，知道该敌营长、连长、排长都伤亡，里面无当官的掌握，就根据这样情况，布置喊话内容：“你们营长、连长都伤亡了，你们想一想是要死还是要活，想活的就过来，想死的等着吧！”“你们是被阎锡山兵农合一抓来的兵，兵农合一就是不让老百姓活！”敌人回答了：“我们愿意过去，不知过去后你们怎么办？”敌人对我们提出的保证还有些怀疑。喊话小组喊了一天，敌人未打一枪，营长、教导员就亲自去喊，敌人说：“喊得轻些，不要叫我们当官的听见。”我们即根据敌人这种顾虑提出三个保证条件，敌人还是不放心的说：“可得讲良心啦！”某营长认为事情成熟，立即表明态度说：“我就是营长，我叫×××，我这个营就是打你们的，你们放下武器，我保证你们安全！”接着就规定暗号，敌人说：“天黑时，你们先打一个手榴弹，我们打几个手榴弹就过来。”但一营同志怕敌有阴谋，就规定我们派一人到碉堡近处，拍手为记。天黑派营部通讯员秦良玉去联络，未到敌碉堡时，敌两个班长急得要命的喊：“快叫营长派人来吧，再等就晚了！”（怕当官的发现了）随即又派一人过去，双方约好交接武器，敌人旋即将枪支捆扎好了，搬出了碉堡。就是这样，胜利的争取了两个连放下武器。
