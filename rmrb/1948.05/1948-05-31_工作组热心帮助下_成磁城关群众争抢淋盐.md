　　With the Enthusiastic Help of the Work Team
  　Citizens of Chengci Town Scramble to Leach Salt
    [Chengci News] After the active assistance of the work team, the leaching salt industry in Chengci Town has solved the difficulties of the masses and has now set off a mass upsurge of leaching saltpeter soil. In the past, Chengci did not pay enough attention to the leaching salt and boiling saltpeter industry. At the meeting of leaching salt households, the work team first made self-criticism, asking the masses for their opinions and what difficulties had not been resolved. The masses raised the difficulties of wanting to work but lacking furniture, short pots, and short vats. After the meeting, the work team went to various streets to convene meetings of poor peasants, determined to issue loans to help everyone. However, at the meeting, the masses did not dare to speak boldly and were very cold. The work team immediately conducted research and went to the masses to understand the situation, discovering that the masses had three concerns: (1) The masses were afraid that the official price would be set after the saltpeter was boiled; (2) They were also afraid that the government would collect the saltpeter at a low price, like collecting cotton during the enemy's time; (3) They were afraid that they would not be able to repay the loan in the future. For example, Liu Yun's mother in North Street said: "I am in difficulty! It is difficult. Now there is not enough food, but if I use it, I have to pay it back in lumps and pieces (meaning paying back all at once), which is difficult! I dare not use it." Zhu Jingui also said: "Others buy saltpeter for nine hundred or one thousand (per jin), but our government's official price is seven hundred yuan per jin. Who will do it like this?" After understanding these situations, they immediately explained to the masses, guaranteeing that the official price would not be set, and that they would not be treated like the enemy, allowing them to sell wherever the price was high. If there were difficulties in repayment, the deadline could be extended, and it could be repaid in installments instead of all at once. After resolving these ideological concerns, the masses dared to report boldly. In Six Streets, more than sixty households reported themselves. After evaluation, fifty-four households who were actually in difficulty and could not afford furniture were given a total of 640,000 yuan, which solved the difficulty of pots and vats for these households. After the difficulties were resolved, the masses immediately took action, forming an upsurge of scraping salt soil. There are six streets in the city, with a total of 802 households and 3,005 people. There are 211 households engaged in scraping salt soil (41 old households and 170 new households). Every day, 459 men and women participate in scraping salt soil, all vying to get up at five o'clock in the morning to work. If they get up a little later, they have to scrape the soil twice. Men, women, old, and young are all very energetic. The masses in North Street are even more active. There are 74 households in North Street, and 60 of them are scraping salt soil, accounting for more than 81% of the total number of households. For example, Liu Zhencai's mother, who has eye disease (in her sixties or seventies), gets up as soon as she hears the rooster crow. By dawn, she has swept the street clean and can sweep four or five carts of soil. Liu Jincai's family of four runs a small mill. Every day, he asks his mother to watch the mill and leaves the children at home to sleep. The couple gets up at five o'clock in the morning to sweep the soil until after breakfast before going back to cook. Poor peasant representative Xue Fengqi said: "I have been leaching salt and boiling saltpeter all my life. I will never forget this good business even when I die." He can leach five pots of soil in five days, producing seventeen or eighteen jin of salt and boiling eight jin of saltpeter. On average, he can get more than three jin of salt and more than one and a half jin of saltpeter every day, equivalent to an income of more than 2,000 yuan in Jicha currency per day.

　　工作组热心帮助下
  　成磁城关群众争抢淋盐
    【成磁消息】成磁城关淋盐业经过工作组积极帮助，解决了群众困难，现已掀起群众性的括土淋盐热潮。成磁过去对于淋盐、熬硝业重视不够，淋盐户会议上，工作组首先做了自我批评，让群众提意见，有那些困难没有解决。群众提出想干没有家具，短锅短缸等困难。工作组开罢会后，又分头深入各街，召开贫农会议，决心发放贷款帮助大家。但在会场上，群众不敢大胆发言，非常冷落。工作组马上又作了研究，又分别深入群众了解情况，发现群众中有三个问题：（一）群众怕熬出硝来定官价卡住了；（二）还怕政府低价收硝，怕和敌人在时收棉花一样办；（三）怕使了款将来还不起。如北街刘云母亲说：“我困难吧！也是困难，现在粮食也不够吃，可是我这使了以后一疙瘩一块的还（一下子还的意思），可是困难的啦！我可不敢使。”还有朱金贵说：“别人买硝九百的、一千的（一斤），咱政府官价七百元一斤，这样谁还干？”了解了这些情况，就马上给群众解释，保证不定官价，不会象敌人那样办，允许哪里价高就往哪里卖。还款时如有困难，可延长期限，不能整还可以零还。解决了这些思想顾虑后，群众才敢大胆自报了，六道街共自报了六十余户，经评议后，实际困难的和买不起家具的有五十四户，共贷给他们六十四万元，才解决了这些户锅、缸的困难。困难解决后，群众即积极行动起来，形成了括盐土热潮。城里共分六道街，共有八百零二户，三千零五口人，新老括盐土户有二百十一户（老括家四十一户，新括家一百七十户），每日参加括盐土的人数男女四五九名，都是争前恐后的起五更的干。如少起晚些，就得括二遍土。男女老幼都非常带劲。北街的群众更积极，北街共有七十四户就有六十户括盐土的，占总户数百分之八十一以上。如刘振才母亲带着眼病（有六七十岁了）一听鸡叫就起来了。到天明就扫光了街，能扫四五车子土。刘进才全家四口人开了一个小磨坊，每天叫他母亲看着磨把小孩留家睡觉，他俩口子就起五更扫土扫到早饭后才回去做饭。贫农代表薛凤其说：“我淋盐熬硝一辈子了，我死了也忘不了这个好买卖。”他五天能淋五锅土，能出十七八斤盐，还能熬八斤硝，平均每天能得盐三斤多，硝一斤半还多，折合冀钞每天收入二千余元。
