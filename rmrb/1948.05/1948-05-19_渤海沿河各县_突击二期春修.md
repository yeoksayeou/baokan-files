　　Bohai Counties Along the River
    Launch Second Phase of Spring Repairs
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th] Taking advantage of the break before the summer harvest, the Bohai region is launching a concentrated effort on the second phase of the Yellow River spring repair project. Currently, the masses in the counties along the river have set off a surge of activity in repairing dangerous sections, transporting materials, and donating bricks and stones. In Bin County, over a million catties of stone materials were donated in three days. In Qudi Town, Seventh District of Jiyang, 250,000 catties of stone were donated in seven days. In Fusi Village, Tongbin District of Boxing, 235,000 bricks were donated overnight. Huimin and two other counties dispatched 1,200 carts to transport construction materials. Gao(yuan) Qing(cheng) County mobilized 4,600 laborers to rush-repair the Liu Chunjia dangerous section, which was destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits last summer. Laborers in the Hexi District start work before dawn, pushing earth materials with small carts from 300 meters away from the embankment. Laborers in the Jianping District transport earth from 500 meters away, with each person pushing more than one cubic meter of earth per day. The laborers also established evaluation committees, launched labor competitions, and organized visiting groups for mutual observation and learning. The head of the Hexi District recently brought a large number of letters of appreciation from the masses to慰劳 (offer comfort to) the laborers, reporting on the production situation of their families, which greatly encouraged the laborers and further improved work efficiency. In addition: This project is vast in scale, requiring a total of 1.62 million cubic meters of earth, 15.9 million catties of straw, over 40,000 cubic meters of brick and stone materials (5,000 catties per cubic meter), and over 10.47 million man-days of labor. The Provincial River Affairs Bureau and the Bohai Party and government organs have decided that, in addition to the allocation by the counties within the region, a large amount of labor and materials will be transferred from other regions, and a work-for-relief method will be adopted to organize people in disaster areas to participate in river repair.
