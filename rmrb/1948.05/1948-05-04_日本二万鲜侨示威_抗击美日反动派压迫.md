　　Japanese Authorities Crack Down on Korean Residents' Demonstrations
  　Resisting Oppression from American and Japanese Reactionaries
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Comprehensive reports indicate that bloody struggles against oppression by Korean residents have erupted in several major cities in Japan. The reactionary government of Hitoshi Ashida promulgated an ordinance on the 24th of last month to oppress Korean residents—the "Regulations for the Management of Korean Schools" (stipulating that Korean schools must teach in Japanese, use Japanese textbooks, and prohibit the use of Korean language and Korean textbooks). Disregarding repeated protests and requests from Korean residents, they forcibly closed Korean schools in Japan and carried out indiscriminate arrests of Korean residents. These reactionary measures have provoked increasingly fierce acts of resistance from Korean residents. At noon on the 24th, approximately 1,500 Koreans in Hyogo Prefecture, Tokyo, surrounded the prefectural government. About 200 of them stormed into the prefectural government office and detained the Japanese governor and deputy governor. By 5:00 PM, the prefectural government was forced to accept all the demands of the Koreans, agreeing to release 68 Korean students who had been arrested for protesting and striking in Japanese public schools on the 20th. On the same day, 1,500 Koreans in Kobe clashed with Japanese military police, at one point storming into the prefectural government and taking the governor and Japanese officials captive. Korean women serving in Japanese public schools in the city also held protest strikes. In Osaka, on the 23rd, 5,000 to 6,000 Koreans angrily attempted to storm into the prefectural government, engaging in a fierce struggle with the suppressing military police for as long as six hours, with ten Koreans suffering serious injuries. Incidents of Koreans fighting with Japanese police during protest demonstrations also occurred in Yamaguchi and Okayama. It is reported that in Kobe alone, as many as 309 Koreans have been unreasonably arrested. Sources confirm that these fascist measures by the Japanese reactionary authorities are aimed at forcibly expelling Koreans from the country and are being carried out with the support of MacArthur. A statement released by MacArthur Headquarters on the 23rd openly stated that Korean residents in Japan must "abide by Japanese government ordinances" or return to Korea immediately.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Comprehensive Tokyo news: Korean residents in Japan continue to wage an indomitable struggle against tyranny. On the 26th, over 3,000 Korean residents from Kyoto, Nara, Hyogo and other places went to Osaka, joining the demonstrating Korean residents in the city to form a large demonstration and parade of 20,000 people. MacArthur dispatched armored vehicles and sent American military police to assist 2,500 Japanese police to suppress the demonstrators, which led to clashes. In Tokyo, fourteen Korean schools disregarded the closure orders of the American and Japanese reactionary authorities and insisted on opening classes on the 27th. At the same time, a unit of the Tokyo Korean Boy Scouts marched to the Japanese Ministry of Education and staged a three-hour sit-in protest until Minister of Education Tatsuo Morito was forced to agree to consider their four demands (namely: 1. Allow Korean schools to teach Korean language and Korean textbooks; 2. Abolish oppression and discrimination against Korean residents; 3. Guarantee the admission of Korean students to Japanese schools; 4. Korean students have administrative freedom). The Korean residents' organizations in Japan, such as the "Korean Residents League in Japan" and the "Tokyo Korean Youth Association," also rose up in protest, denouncing the American and Japanese authorities for being fully responsible for the incident, demanding the revocation of the orders, and proposing: the abolition of national oppression and discrimination against Korean residents, allowing Korean residents to have the freedom to run schools, and allowing Korean schools to teach Korean language and Korean textbooks. According to various sources, the above-mentioned cities in Japan have declared a state of emergency. Lieutenant General Eichelberger, commander of the US Eighth Army, flew to Kobe on the 26th to intimidate the population, claiming that "severe punishment will be imposed, informants will be prosecuted, and armed suppression will be carried out." In addition to reiterating that Korean residents must obey Japanese reactionary laws and supporting the Japanese government's closure of Korean schools, the US military authorities have blamed the incident on the Japanese Communist Party, plotting to create a pretext for further violent suppression. The reactionary Ashida authorities are now deploying more military police in cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Osaka has even explicitly prohibited Korean residents from entering the area and is frantically arresting Korean residents. So far, in Kobe, Osaka, and Hyogo alone, over 2,200 Korean residents have been unreasonably arrested.

　　日本二万鲜侨示威
  　抗击美日反动派压迫
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合报导：日本若干大城市爆发鲜侨反压迫的流血斗争。芦田反动政府于上月二十四日颁布压迫鲜侨的法令——“管理朝鲜学校”规则（规定朝鲜学校须以日语教授，采用日本课本，禁用鲜文及朝鲜课本）；并不顾鲜侨的一再抗议与请求，强行封闭日境朝鲜学校，肆行逮捕鲜侨。此种反动措施激起了鲜侨日益激烈的抗暴义举。二十四日午间，东京区兵库县约一千五百名鲜人包围县府，其中约二百名冲进县府衙门，将日正副县知事加以禁闭，至下午五时，该县府被迫接受鲜人全部要求，答应释放二十日在日本公立学校就读，因抗议罢课而被捕的六十八名朝鲜学生。同日，神户一千五百名鲜人与日宪警发生冲突时，一度冲进县府，并俘走县知事及日官员。在该城日本公立学校服役之朝鲜妇女亦举行抗议罢工。大阪方面，二十三日五六千名鲜人愤怒地欲冲入县府时，曾与弹压宪警坚持斗争至六小时之久，十名鲜人受重伤。山口及冈山等地亦发生鲜人因抗议示威而与日警搏斗的事件。据悉，仅神户一处，被无理逮捕之鲜人就达三○九名。各方消息证实：日反动当局此种法西斯措施，旨在企图将鲜人强迫驱逐出境，且系在麦克阿瑟支持下进行的。麦克阿瑟总部二十三日公布的声明中亦公然要留日鲜人必须“遵守日政府法令”，或者即归返朝鲜。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合东京消息：留日鲜侨继续进行不屈不挠的抗暴斗争。二十六日，三千余名鲜侨自京都、奈良、兵库等地前往大阪，与该城示威鲜侨汇合，蔚成二万人之大示威游行。麦克阿瑟出动装甲车并派美宪警协助二千五百名日警前往弹压时，曾发生冲突。东京方面，十四所朝鲜学校不顾美日反动当局的封闭令，于二十七日坚持开课。同时，东京朝鲜童子军一部，列队赴日文部省进行三小时的静坐抗议，直至文相森户辰男被迫答应考虑他们的四项要求，（即：一、准许朝鲜学校教授鲜文与朝鲜课本；二、取消压迫和歧视鲜侨；三、保证日校招收朝鲜学生；四、朝鲜学生有行政自由。（始行离去。留日鲜侨组织“日境鲜侨同盟”、“东京朝鲜青年协会”等亦奋起抗议，痛斥美日当局对此次事件应负全责；要求收回成命；并提出：取消对鲜侨的民族压迫和歧视，允许鲜侨有办校的自由及朝鲜学校教授鲜文与朝鲜课本等要求。据各方消息，日本上述诸城已宣布处于紧急状态中。美第八军军长艾其贝尔格二十六日亲飞神户，大肆恫吓，声称“将严厉处分，检举启事者，并进行武力弹厌”。美军当局除重申鲜侨须服从日本反动法令，支持日政府封闭朝鲜学校外，并将事件归咎于日本共产党，阴谋制造进一步暴力镇压的借口。芦田反动当局现正在东京、大阪等城增派宪警，大阪且明令禁止鲜侨进入该区；并疯狂逮捕鲜侨。迄今，仅神户、大阪、兵库三处被无理拘捕鲜侨，达二千二百名以上。
