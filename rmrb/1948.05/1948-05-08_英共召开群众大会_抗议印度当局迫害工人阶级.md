Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: London, April 26th: The British Communist Party held a mass protest meeting in Hyde Park on April 25th to oppose the persecution of the working class and its leaders by the Indian authorities. British Communist leader Dutt spoke at the meeting about the Indian situation and the tragic lives of the Indian working people, saying that prices have risen many times higher than before the war, but the wages of millions of workers are less than ten shillings a week (ten times lower than British workers' wages); female workers in the mining industry only get five shillings a week. After listing the recent facts such as thousands of miners, dock workers and other industrial workers in Bombay demanding the release of arrested leaders and going on strike, Dutt emphasized that the struggle of Indian workers is part of the overall struggle of the entire working class for democracy and freedom. The conference finally passed a condemnation motion, strongly protesting against the reactionary measures of the Indian authorities to persecute the working class.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: London: Mills, a left-wing Member of Parliament from the British Labour Party, was expelled from the party by the party's leading body on April 29th, on the pretext that he and twenty-one other Labour MPs, including Zilliacus, had jointly sent a telegram to the Italian Socialist Party in support of their election campaign. Zilliacus and others are also under threat of expulsion. This unreasonable measure has aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of Labour Party members. Mills himself issued a statement to the press after being expelled, saying that his expulsion was because the right wing of the Labour Party wanted to "clamp down on all criticism"; and he denounced Bevin for making Britain surrender to the United States "for a few dollars." Labour MP Lipton said angrily in a speech in London on the 29th that the Labour Party Executive Committee "is wielding the big stick barbarously." The Hanchak (Essex County) Labour Party local branch meeting voted to fully trust the MPs threatened with expulsion. It is expected that the Labour Party parliamentary group meeting on the 5th will provoke more condemnation from progressive MPs in the party against the reactionary leaders of the party. Nenni and General Secretary Basu of the Italian Socialist Party also sent a telegram to Mills on April 29th, expressing their solidarity.

　　英共召开群众大会
  　抗议印度当局迫害工人阶级
    【新华社陕北五日电】伦敦上月二十六日讯：英国共产党曾于上月二十五日在海德公园召开群众抗议大会，反对印度当局对工人阶级及其领袖的迫害。英共领袖杜德在会上纵谈印度局势与印度劳动人民的悲惨生活称：物价较战前已高涨许多倍，但成百万工人的工资，每周却低于十先令（即比英国工人工资低十倍）；采矿工业中的女工每周只得五先令。杜德在列举最近孟买成千矿工、码头工人与其他工业工人要求释放被捕领袖而进行罢工等事实后，强调指出：印度工人的斗争，是整个工人阶级争取民主与自由的总斗争的一部份。大会最后通过一项谴责案，强烈抗议印度当局迫害工人阶级的反动措施。
    【新华社陕北五日电】伦敦讯：英工党左冀议员米尔斯，于上月二十九日被该党领导机关，借口他与齐里亚库斯等二十一位工党议员曾联名致电意社会党支持该党竞选，将其开除出党。齐氏等亦正受被开除的威胁。此一无理措举，已引起工党广大党员的不满，米尔斯本人于被开除后即向报界发表声明称：他的被开除是因为工党右冀想“钳制一切批评”；并痛斥贝文“为了几块美元”正使英国向美国投降。工党议员李普顿二十九日在伦敦演说时愤懑地说：工党执委会“在横蛮地挥舞着大棒。”汉查祺（伊塞克斯郡）工党地方支部会议投票完全信任被威胁开除出党的议员。预料五日召开的工党国会党团会上，将会引起该党进步议员对该党反动头子的更多谴责。意社会党南尼及总书记巴苏亦于上月二十九日电谢米尔斯，表示声援。
