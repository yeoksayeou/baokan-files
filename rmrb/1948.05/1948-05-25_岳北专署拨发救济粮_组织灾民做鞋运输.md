　　Yuebei Special District Allocates Relief Grain
  　Organizes Disaster Victims to Make Shoes and Transport Goods
    [Taiyue News] The Yuebei Special District allocated 5,000 shi of grain to provide relief to refugees in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi counties. Due to the Yan bandit frantically seizing grain and conscripting soldiers, a severe famine has been created in Pingyao, Jiexiu and Lingshi. In Lingshi and Jiexiu counties alone, 23,000 people cannot survive. Pingyao needs relief for 40,000 people. Among the refugees who fled to our area, Pingyao county alone has more than 20,000 people. In addition to allocating grain for emergency relief, the democratic government also tried to resettle them: First, it used work as relief, organizing production. Women make military shoes, and men engage in transportation, carrying rails, and repairing roads. Since the beginning of spring, women have earned 2,500 shi of rice by making shoes, 450 shi of rice by transporting goods, and 400 shi of rice by carrying rails, solving some of the difficulties. Second, sell grain at low prices, allowing the masses to exchange rags, licorice, scrap copper and other things for grain. 2,000 shi have now been sold. Third, 3.5 million yuan was extracted from the spring plowing loans to organize the masses to engage in porterage and trade production. Now the refugees who have fled to Qinyuan have stabilized their lives.

　　岳北专署拨发救济粮
  　组织灾民做鞋运输
    【太岳消息】岳北专署拨粮五千石救济平遥、介休、灵石三县难民。平介灵因阎匪拼命抢粮抓丁，造成严重灾荒。灵、介两县即有二万三千人无法生活。平遥需要救济的有四万人。逃到我区的难民，仅平遥一县就有二万多人。民主政府除拨粮急救外，并设法安置：第一是以工代赈，组织生产。妇女作军鞋，男人搞运输，抬铁轨，修路。入春以来妇女做鞋赚米两千五百石，运输赚米四百五十石，抬铁轨赚米四百石，解决了一部分困难。第二是低价粜粮，让群众以破布、甘草、烂铜等东西换粮食。现已粜出两千石。第三是从春耕贷款中抽出三百五十万元组织群众搞拉挑贸易生产。现在逃来沁源的难民，生活上都已安定了。
