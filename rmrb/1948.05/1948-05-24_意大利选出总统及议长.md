Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 21st: Rome dispatch: The joint session of the Italian parliament's two houses began electing a president on the 10th. After two rounds of voting, the American lackey Sforza, who was strongly supported by the Christian Democratic Party, failed because he did not receive two-thirds of the votes. According to a United Press report, in the two rounds of voting, one hundred Christian Democratic parliamentarians disobeyed Gasperi's orders and, along with other parties, opposed Sforza and supported Nicola. In the third round of voting, the Christian Democratic Party had to withdraw Sforza as a candidate and put forward former Vice President, and former Governor of the Bank of Italy, the Liberal Luigi Einaudi, but the result was still a failure. It was not until the last round of voting on the 11th (according to the last round of voting, only a majority is required to be elected) that Einaudi was elected president with a very slight majority of only sixty-seven votes more than half. Einaudi is 74 years old, belongs to the Liberal Party, and was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget Adjustment, and former Governor of the Bank of Italy. The Italian traitor Gasperi was commissioned on the 12th to form a new cabinet. The speakers and deputy speakers of the two houses of the Italian parliament were also elected on the 8th. Bonomi and Grandi (Christian Democratic Party) are the speakers of the Senate and the National Assembly, respectively. Representatives of the People's Democratic Front, Scoccimarro (Italian Communist Party), Molè (Socialist Party), and two other Christian Democratic Party members are the deputy speakers of the Senate. Fernando (Socialist Party) of the People's Democratic Front has been elected as one of the four deputy speakers of the National Assembly.
