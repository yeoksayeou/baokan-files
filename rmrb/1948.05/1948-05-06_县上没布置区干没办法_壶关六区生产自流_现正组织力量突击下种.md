　　County Didn't Assign District Cadres, No Choice:
　　Huguan Sixth District Production Proceeds Spontaneously
　　Now Organizing Forces for Crash Planting
　　Old Methods Abolished, No New Methods Available
　　Afraid of Making Mistakes, Daren't Take Responsibility, Just Wait for Instructions from Above
　　Huguan Should Conduct a County-Wide Review
　　[Huguan News] The Sixth District formally arranged for spring plowing and production at the end of March, but until now, no planting campaign has formed. On April 19, the district convened a meeting of leading production cadres in the district, and found that the achievements were not significant, and the reason for the slack production was that the district cadres leading production had many ideological problems.
　　(1) They are not interested in production work, and think that good cadres are engaged in "filling gaps" and bad cadres are engaged in production. For example, Comrade Xi Ling said: "I came back from study to participate in the distribution of land, and then I was asked to engage in production. We bad cadres can't get ahead, and we don't know how to engage in production. The old methods have to be abolished, and we don't have any new methods. All we know is to talk about democracy. Anyway, we cadres are surplus." Comrade Qin Yushuang said: "We can't even participate in the land distribution." Li San, on the other hand, said: "I was thinking about studying land distribution, but I was told to engage in production. After a period of time in production, I will forget everything I learned."
　　(2) Simply follow the poor peasant and hired laborer line, relax the village cadres, dare not approach the village cadres, afraid that the masses will say that they are following the cadre line, only looking for the poor and hired laborers, and forming mutual suspicion, and the leadership is in a difficult situation. Shi ×× only followed the poor peasant and hired laborer line when he arrived at Dahe, and did not go to understand the production situation much. He stayed for more than ten days and did not approach the cadres. He only held two cadre meetings, and he was very afraid of taking the wrong line. If the masses raise the issue of cadres, they cannot be resolved in a timely manner, and the production enthusiasm of the masses and cadres is further reduced. The above problems are closely related to the lack of formal arrangements for production by the leadership. Du Jiuze said: "I am just waiting for instructions from above. I am thinking that the county party committee has not yet made arrangements, and I dare not mess around, for fear that I will mess up the work and be responsible for it myself. I can't handle it." Li Xing said: "In the past, when we engaged in production, the county party committee had to hold meetings to make arrangements, and the district had to conduct specific discussions. This year, we are doing it in a muddle." Villages that are engaged in production have not been "filling gaps", and they dare not even criticize the thoughts of village cadres, for fear of making mistakes. For example, when a village cadre was asked by a district cadre to lead production, he said: "Now we want to engage in production, and we are giving us 'rice soup' again. We are no longer needed, and we are just being asked to pass the test." The district cadres also had no choice. Li Cuihong said: "When I am asked to lead production, I don't even know which direction to go. When I go to the village, I just tell the cadres not to use administrative orders but to have an attitude. I don't give them specific methods to study, and the cadres are confused. These ten days at the bottom have been spent in a muddle." They don't know how to rectify mutual aid either. When six or seven people in Zhuangshang Village helped each other transport manure, Comrade Li San said: "This is just formalism." So everyone dared not organize a large number of mutual aid groups. They also don't know if the methods of work points, accounting work, and equivalent exchange can be used. Comrade Dong Fuyou is illiterate and is often depressed. When he went to work in Tuchi Village, he walked and cried. He said: "I was thinking of finding a way to die, but I am afraid that others will say that I have a problem; if I work, there is really no way, I can't even write a meal slip, I feel that I can't do it, I just want to study." Guo Sanni said: "I am thinking of rectifying the party, which is just to struggle against the cadres. My family has hired people for more than ten years, and my class status is not good. I don't know if I will live to the new year, eating only one bowl of rice a day. I am thinking that if I am asked to pass the test, I will pass, and if I am not asked to pass, I will talk about it later."
　　Based on the above situation, District Captain Xiang Anxi first reviewed his own shortcomings, such as relaxing the leadership of spring plowing and production, and not contacting and helping everyone enough. Combined with everyone's ideological problems, he raised the questions of what is a good cadre, what is a bad cadre, is it okay to just "fill gaps" and not produce, who will lead, and what are the differences between leading democratic "filling gaps" and leading production. After everyone's discussion, the general cadres said: It is the same to do any work, and it is okay to do a good job in production. This time, we will go down and focus on one group to do a good job in the production of one village. Some said: "Let's do it boldly, and if it's wrong, we'll do it again." Some said: "Production and filling gaps are equally important, it's just a matter of division of labor among cadres." Some said: "We should transform the village cadres from production." Some also proposed to quickly solve the production difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers. After everyone was initially clear, they organized a spring plowing and planting team to go to the countryside separately, and absorbed strong village cadres to participate. District Chief Guo served as the captain and directly led the district's crash planting. On the 23rd, the Shuzhang District held a meeting of village cadres, labor heroes, and middle and poor peasant representatives in Hedong, and selected eleven strong village cadres to form the Shuzhang District Crash Planting Committee, with a captain and deputy captain (two branch secretaries), and nine committee members. According to the natural relations of each village, five interlocking groups were formed, including Fangdai, Wangliushui, Majiazhuang, Huiche, and Nanguo, to supervise each other, promote the exchange of experience, and launch competitions. They met every four days to talk and conduct mutual inspections. County and district cadres were distributed to various villages to provide specific leadership. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm was very high. After the masses in Hedong held a meeting that night, they plowed all the land the next day, and all the dozens of drills in the village were planting. They plan to finish planting the millet in four days. (Xiang Anxi, Guo Tongxiao, Wang Liangyu)
　　Judging from this report, not only is there ideological confusion among village cadres in the leadership of Huguan's production, but even district cadres are very confused ideologically. One of the important reasons is that the county party committee did not make specific arrangements and studies for spring plowing and production this year. What to do, how to do it, who to rely on, the district cadres don't know, and if they mess it up, they have to be responsible for it themselves. How can they not be depressed? The district captain reviewed his own relaxation of leadership and insufficient help to everyone, and organized everyone to discuss and study, eliminating some ideological obstacles and coming up with some specific methods, which is very good. However, it is not yet known whether the county has changed this situation and whether it has paid attention to leading spring plowing and production. We hope that the leaders of Huguan County and the leaders of various places will quickly check and thoroughly overcome the spontaneous phenomenon in spring plowing.

　　县上没布置区干没办法
  　壶关六区生产自流
    现正组织力量突击下种
    老一套取消新办法没有
    怕错不敢负责光等上级指示
  　壶关应作全县检查
    【壶关消息】六区自三月底就正式布置了春耕生产，可是直到现在，并没形成下种运动。四月十九日，区里召集全区领导生产干部会议，发现成绩不大，生产松懈的原因，是领导生产的区干部思想问题很多。
    （一）对生产工作不感兴趣，认为是好干部搞填补，孬干部搞生产。如锡令同志说：“学习回来是参加平分，后来又叫搞生产，咱这孬干部吃不开，生产咱也不知怎搞。要取消老一套，新办法咱也没有，光会说个民主。反正咱这干部是余剩一个。”秦玉双同志说：“咱就连个平分也不能参加。”李三则说：“想着学习平分，非叫搞生产，干上一个时期生产，非把学习的填补东西忘尽不行。”
    （二）单纯走贫雇路线，把村干放松，不敢接近村干，怕群众说是走干部路线，光找贫雇，又形成互相猜疑，领导上青黄不接。史××到了大河光走贫雇路线，不多去了解生产情况，住了十几天，对干部不接近，只开了两次干部会，还很怕走差路线。群众提出干部问题，又不能及时解决，群众与干部生产情绪都更降低。以上这些问题，和领导上没有正式布置生产关系很大。杜九则说：“我是光等上级指示，想着县委还没布置哩，自己不敢瞎搞，怕搞坏工作自己负责，咱可顶不住。”李兴则说：“以前搞生产，县委要开会布置，区上要具体讨论，今年是糊里糊涂搞哩。”生产村未进行填补，就连村干部的思想也不敢批评，怕弄错。比如，有一个村干部在区干叫他领导生产时，他说：“现在要生产哩，又给咱灌米汤，不用咱了，就要叫咱过关”。区干部也没办法。李崔红说：“叫领导生产，咱也不摸方向，到村上光给干部说，不要行政命令要态度，也不给他们研究具体办法，弄的干部迷三倒四，这十几天在下边就是闷闷懂懂的。”整顿互助也不知是怎样整顿。庄上村六七个群众互助起来往地送粪时，李三则同志还说：“这才是形式主义哩。”所以大家也不敢大量组织互助。计工折工、等价交换的办法，也不知能使不能了。董福有同志不识字，经常苦闷。往土池村工作走时，一面走，一面哭。他说：“想着寻个死吧，又怕别人说我有问题；工作吧，真没办法，连个饭条也开不了，觉着自己不行，光想去学习。”郭三妮说：“我想着整党，就是斗争干部哩。我家雇过十几年人，成份不好，还不知活到过年活不到，一天吃一碗饭。想着叫过关就过，不叫过再说。”
    根据以上情况，区队长向安喜同志首先检讨自己对春耕生产领导放松，对大家联系与帮助不够等毛病，又结合着大家的思想问题，提出啥是好干部，啥是坏干部，光填补不生产行不行，谁来领导，领导民主填补和领导生产有哪些不同。经过大家讨论，一般干部表示：搞什么工作也一样，搞好生产也行。这次下去，要抓住一个组搞好一个村的生产。有的说：“大刀阔斧的干吧，不对了重来。”有的说：“生产和填补一样重要，就是个干部分工问题。”有的说：“应该从生产中改造村干部。”也有的提议要赶快解决贫雇生产困难。大家初步明确后，就组织春耕下种队分头下乡，并吸收强的村干参加，由郭区长任队长，直接领导全区突击下种。树掌小区于二十三日在河东召开各村干部、劳英及中贫农代表会议，选出十一个强的村干组成树掌小区突击下种委员会，设有正副队长（两个支书）、九个委员，又根据各村自然关系组成芳岱、汪流水、马家庄、回车、南郭等五个连环小组，互相督促，推动交流经验，展开竞赛，四天开会一次，交谈并进行互相检查。县区干部根据具体情况，分布各村，具体领导。这样，大家情绪很高。河东群众经过当天夜里开会，第二天全部刨地，全村十几张耧都在下种。他们计划四天就要把谷子下种完。（向安喜、郭同孝、王良玉）
    从这个报导看，目前壶关生产领导上不仅存在着村干部的思想混乱，连区干部思想也是十分混乱的。其重要原因之一：是县委今年对春耕生产根本未做具体布置研究。搞什么，怎样搞，依靠谁，区干部都不知道，搞坏了又要他们自己负责，他们怎能不苦闷呢？区队长检讨自己放松领导，对大家帮助不够，又组织大家讨论研究，扫除了一些思想障碍，想出了些具体办法，这是非常好的。但全县目前是否改变了这种情况，是否注意了领导春耕生产，还不了解。我们希望壶关县领导上与各地领导上赶快检查，彻底克服春耕中的自流现象。
