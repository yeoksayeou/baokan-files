　　Labor Emulation in New Democratic Countries of Eastern Europe
  　Industrial Production Exceeds Plans
    Czech Farmers Receive an Average of 1 to 5 Hectares of Land
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] Dispatches from various sources: The people of the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, in the high tide of labor emulation, are continuously over fulfilling their production plans. Czech industrial production exceeded the plan by 6.4 percent in March and 3.1 percent in April. Among them, in March, anthracite exceeded by 2.3 percent, bituminous coal by 4 percent, steel by 4.2 percent, hardware by 5 percent, chemicals by 6 percent, and textiles by 5 percent; in April, coal exceeded by 4.3 percent, steel by 11.6 percent, hardware by 6.5 percent, chemicals by 2 percent, and glass by 22.1 percent.
    In Poland, in the 26 days of April, more than 5.8 million tons of communist coal were produced, exceeding the plan by more than 520,000 tons, which is equal to the amount exceeding the plan in the first three months; in the first three months, pig iron production exceeded the plan by 4 percent, steel by 7 percent, and ferrous metals by 15 percent.
    In Hungary, under the goal of completing the three-year plan in two and a half years, industrial production was originally planned to reach 89 percent of the pre-war level by the end of the first year, but it has now reached 94 percent; among them, coal production has exceeded the pre-war level by 20 percent, and steel has also exceeded the pre-war level. In May, 22 million meters of cotton fabrics will be produced, exceeding the pre-war level by 3 million meters.
    In Bulgaria, as a result of the nationalization of industry, the metal, chemical, electrical, textile, food, and leather industries increased production by 18 to 20 percent in January and February compared with the same period last year when industries were privately owned; industrial production in March exceeded the plan by 13 percent; and production in the first quarter exceeded the same period last year by 43.1 percent. The Popov Dol coal mine youth team has already completed its annual coal production plan. Workers at the Fana factory produced 2 million meters more fabric in less than four months this year than in the same period last year. 250,000 workers are building the two major water conservancy projects, "Rositsa" and "Dimitrov," which are scheduled to be completed within the year. The former will irrigate 23,000 hectares (equivalent to 368,000 mu) of land in the Mibilian plain, and the latter will irrigate 34,000 hectares (equivalent to 544,000 mu) of land in the Stara Zagora plain in central Bulgaria. Both will provide enormous power.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] Prague dispatch: Czech Prime Minister Gottwald announced: "The Czech landlord class is being eliminated, and landless and land-poor peasants have received a total of 3.5 million hectares (equivalent to 56 million mu) of land." This was announced by Czech Prime Minister Gottwald on the 16th to 20,000 farmers gathered in Wenceslas Square in Prague to celebrate the parade. The day marked the centenary of the abolition of serfdom in the Czech Republic and the 30th anniversary of the Republic. Gottwald said: Before May 1945, the best land in the Czech Republic belonged to rich peasants and landlords. 631,000 peasant households had only 1,714,000 hectares of land, with an average of 1 to 5 hectares per household; while 14,500 rich peasant and landlord households occupied 6,743,000 hectares of good land. Although rich peasants and landlords accounted for only 1.7 percent of the total rural population, they occupied 56.2 percent of the arable land. At the same time, peasants with less than 5 hectares of land accounted for 57.1 percent of the agricultural population, but had only 14.4 percent of the arable land. After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, poor and landless peasants received 1.6 million hectares of land as a result of the confiscation of land from German landlords and large landlords; according to the revised Land Reform Law, they also received 867,000 hectares of land; and the law passed by the parliament on March 20, 1948, gave them another 1,033,000 hectares of land. Gottwald pointed out: This is one of the major achievements of the democratic reforms implemented throughout the country after the liberation of Czechoslovakia, especially after the February events of this year.

　　东欧新民主国家劳动竞赛
  　工业生产都超过计划
    捷克农户平均获土地一至五公顷
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方讯：东欧新民主国家人民在劳动竞赛高潮中，不断超过地完成着生产计划。捷工业生产三月份超过计划百分之六点四，四月份超过百分之三点一。其中三月份无烟煤超过百分之二点三，烟煤超过百分之四，钢铁超过百分之四点二，五金超过百分之五，化学超过百分之六，纺织超过百分之五；四月份煤超过百分之四点三，钢铁超过百分之十一点六，五金超过百分之六点五，化学超过百分之二，玻璃超过百分之二十二点一。
    波兰在四月间的二十六天中，共产煤五百八十多万吨，超过计划五十二万余吨，即等于头三个月超过计划的数目；头三个月间，铣铁生产超过计划百分之四，钢超过百分之七，占金属百分之十五。
    匈牙利在二年半完成三年计划的目标下，工业生产预定第一年终要达到战前水平的百分之八十九，而现在已达到百分之九十四；其中煤产已超过战前水平百分之二十，钢铁也超过战前水平，五月份将生产棉织品二千二百万公尺，超过战前水平三百万公尺。
    保加利亚由于工业国有化的结果，一二月份金属、化学、电器、纺织、食品、制革等工业较去年同期工业私有时增产百分之十八到二十；三月份工业生产超过计划百分之十三；第一季生产较去年同期超过百分之四十三点一。波波夫多尔煤矿青年队业已完成全年煤产计划。发那职工在今年不到四个月内产布较去年同时多二百万公尺。二十五万工人正在建筑“罗西查”和“季米特洛夫”两大水闸，预定年内完成，前者将灌溉米比兰平原二万三千海克脱（合三十六万八千亩）土地，后者将灌溉保中部斯塔拉萨哥拉平原三万四千海克脱（合五十四万四千亩）土地，两者将供给巨大动力。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】布拉格讯：捷总理哥特瓦尔德宣布：“捷克地主阶级正在消灭，无地少地农民共获得土地三百五十万公顷（合五千六百万亩）。这是捷总理哥特瓦尔德十六日向汇集布拉格瓦斯拉夫广场举行庆祝游行的两万农民宣布的。是日为捷克废除农奴制百年和共和国三十周年纪念。哥特瓦尔德说：在一九四五年五月以前，捷克最好的土地属于富农和地主。六十三万一千户农民仅有一百七十一万四千公顷土地，每一农户平均有地一到五公顷；而一万四千五百户富农和地主却占有六百七十四万三千公顷好地。虽然富农和地主只占全部农村人口的百分之一点七，他们却占有耕地百分之五十六点二。同时，土地不及五公顷的农民占农业人口百分之五十七点一，但只有百分之十四点四的耕地。苏军解放捷克之后，由于没收德国地主及大地主土地，贫农和无地农民获得了一百六十万公顷土地；依照修正土地改革法，他们又获得了八十六万七千公顷土地；而议会于一九四八年三月二十西日通过的法律，另外又给予他们一百零三万三千公顷土地。哥特瓦尔德指出：这就是捷克解放后，特别是本年二月事件后，全国实行的民主改革的重大成果之一。
