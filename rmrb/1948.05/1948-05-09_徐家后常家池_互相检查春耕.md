　　Xu Jiahou and Changjiachi
  　Mutual Inspection of Spring Plowing
    [Huguan News] Xu Jiahou and Changjiachi villages in the third district of Huguan County each selected three representatives on April 30th to conduct a mutual inspection of spring plowing. One representative went deep into each group, both to assist in production and to learn from experience. Chang Baosong, the representative from Changjiachi, said: "In Xu Jiahou, men and women work together, with a clear and flexible division of labor. They use manpower according to the work, employing three people when needed and two people when needed, saving labor. The best thing is that the work is done thoroughly and cleanly, without any debris. More than half of the 1,200 mu of autumn land has been planted." Ma De'e said: "Spinning and weaving and agriculture are transformed into large-scale labor exchange, with everyone working with a unified effort. Even without spinners and weavers, we have cloth to wear. With a shortage of labor, we can still plant the land, truly achieving both without neglecting either." Finally, Xu Laogou, the representative from Xu Jiahou, said: "In Changjiachi, households with labor provide work to those without, but there is no labor exchange, so individual households without labor have difficulties in production that cannot be resolved, which is a shortcoming. The land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is generally well cultivated on their behalf, with plenty of fertilizer applied. However, no one manages spinning and weaving, and the spinning wheels hang on the walls. Most households have to buy cloth when the seasons change, which is also a major drawback." (Dai Yun)

　　徐家后常家池
  　互相检查春耕
    【壶关消息】壶关三区徐家后、常家池两村，于四月三十日各选代表三人，互相检查春耕，一人深入一组，一面配合生产，一面访问经验。常家池代表常保松说：徐家后男女一齐上手，分工很明确灵活，看生活用人，该三人用三人，该二人用二人，节省劳力。最好处是做造一干二净，也没圪垃，秋地一千二百多亩有一半地种上啦。马得娥说：纺织农业大变工，一疙瘩劲，没人纺织有布穿，缺乏劳力种上地，真正做到两不误。最后徐家后代表徐老狗说：常家池有劳力户工拨工，没有变起工来，因此个别没劳力户，对生产上困难不能解决，是个缺点。抗属地，一般代耕很好，上肥也不少，纺织没人管，车在墙挂，大多数户换季得买布，这也是个大缺点。（岱云）
