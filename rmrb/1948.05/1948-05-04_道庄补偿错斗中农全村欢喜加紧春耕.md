　　[Taiyue News] In Daogzhuang, Quantou, Dujiashan, Guohe, Beichenggong, and other villages in Jincheng, the struggle against middle peasants in the past was chaotic, and the interests of middle peasants were severely infringed upon. In Daozhuang village, out of 77 households in the whole village, there were two rich peasant households (not yet confirmed), but 48 households were struggled against, and 26 households had nothing to eat in January this year. When the county learned of this, it began to correct the errors. In Daozhuang village, it publicly admitted its mistakes, announced that the title of "struggle target" for wrongly struggled middle peasants would be completely abolished, and allocated 15 dan and 5 dou of millet for relief. This was also done in other places such as Geta and Dujiashan. The rest will be compensated when the autumn harvest is抽补. Everyone is very happy and hurries to produce. Middle peasant Qin Xiaohua happily said: "...As long as the truth is told today, the sigh of relief will come down. Middle peasants and poor hired workers are one family, and don't speak two different languages."

　　道庄补偿错斗中农全村欢喜加紧春耕
    【太岳消息】晋城道庄、全头、杜家山、郭河、北城宫等村，过去乱斗中农，侵犯中农利益很厉害。道庄村全村七十七户，有两户富农（还未肯定），可是就斗了四十八户，今年正月就有二十六户没吃的。县上知道了，开始纠正，在道庄村公开承认错误，宣布一律取消错斗中农的“斗争对象”称呼，并拨十五石五斗小米救济。其他圪塔、杜家山等地，也这样办了。其余等秋后抽补时赔偿，大家很喜欢，赶紧生产。中农秦小花喜的说：“……只要今天把理来说正，道口气就下去了。中农贫雇一家人，不说两家话。”
