　　Ping Shun Convenes County-Wide Branch Cadre Meeting to Educate Party Members
  　Establish Democratic Work Style and Lead Production
  　After rectifying the Party's branch cadres, everyone understands the situation through examples.
  　Poor and hired peasants speak the truth, no need to fear individual retaliation.
  　Democracy means acting according to the opinions of the masses, not abandoning leadership.

    [Ping Shun News] The Ping Shun County Party Committee convened a county-wide joint meeting of branch cadres on May 13th, lasting three days, with over 700 attendees. The purpose was to resolve ideological problems among Party members, establish a democratic work style to lead production, and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses in the production movement. The meeting's situation was as follows: 1. Branch cadres generally have a fear of Party rectification, thinking that after working for ten years, even if they have no merit, they have worked hard! They do not lead work, but wait to step down and wait to "pass the test." For example, a branch cadre in Longyugou said: "When I saw in the newspaper that the Party was going to be rectified, I thought we were finished and no longer needed!" They paid close attention to the news about supplementing base points, and some only listened to the bad news, not the good, making wild guesses, which greatly shook the morale of the cadres. Insufficient education and assistance to branches in leadership, insufficient acceptance of Party members' opinions, and kicking away the old foundation with one foot further developed this emotion. At the meeting, the leadership explained the significance of Party rectification as curing diseases and saving people, distinguishing between minor and major mistakes, and improving the relationship between the Party and the masses, not deliberately making things difficult for Party members. Then, they invited the branch cadres of Hongtiguan (base point) to introduce the process of Party rectification in their village in detail, using facts to make the cadres believe in the Party rectification policy, and combined it with their own thoughts to conduct discussions in groups. For example, the secretary of the Paiheng branch said: "If the Party is not rectified again, it will become a situation where the Party is the Party and the masses are the masses." They felt that the Party really needed rectification. 2. Poor and hired masses speak the truth, no need to fear individual retaliation: On the basis of accepting the importance of Party rectification, they further resolved the fear of retaliation for raising false opinions. For example, Guo Yu'en, secretary of the Chuandi branch, said: "It's good to review what happened, but if things that didn't happen are brought up, there's really nothing I can say!" Guo Changsheng of Zhongwujing said: "There must be a lot of opinions from Fu Kui in our village. Originally, it was a mass discussion that asked him to eat from the charity granary, but he insisted that I was the one who came up with the idea." The leadership immediately explained that a small number of incorrect opinions could be clearly distinguished. Because of the lack of democracy in the past, these opinions were not surprising. At the beginning of Party rectification in Hongtiguan, there were once retaliatory opinions, but in the second Party rectification, retaliatory opinions were attacked by the masses. These vivid facts dispelled the concerns of the branch cadres. 3. Resolved the erroneous idea of "loyal and good people have no good ending": At the beginning, this emotion was widespread. In the discussion, the example of Hongtiguan was used to explain who has no good ending? Yue Fenghua of Hongtiguan, the oldest Party member in the village, sheltered landlords and arbitrarily expelled Party members, forcing two people to death for catching adultery. He did not reflect on these mistakes during this Party rectification, and as a result, he was expelled from the Party. This kind of "loyal" person who protects the landlord has no good ending. If he had a good ending, the Party and the masses would have no good ending. The discussion proved that public and private matters are separated, errors are shared, and whoever is responsible is responsible. As long as you seriously review, correct your mistakes, and enthusiastically serve the masses, the masses will support you. At the preliminary conclusion of Party rectification in Hongtiguan, eight or nine people asked to join the Party, which shows that the masses still warmly support the Party. Facts made everyone clear about this issue. Then, the leadership style was discussed. This issue was the most painful and difficult to solve for the cadres. For example, Huang Lianzhu, the village chief of Beitou, said: "Production is easy to lead, but democracy is not easy to do." The discussion clarified that the democratic requirements are the opinions and requirements of the masses. For example, the harvesting of green crops last autumn was not the request of the masses, especially rushing to complete the task, which was opposed by the masses. For example, last autumn, the county's plan was to harvest in twenty to twenty-five days, but at the district level, it became fifteen or sixteen days, and at the village level, it became fourteen days. As a result, the masses suffered. How to achieve democratic leadership? After discussion, it was like this: when the masses make a correct conclusion through discussion, it must be followed. If a few people disagree, they can still retain their opinions; if it is proved in actual practice that the opinion of the minority is correct, the original opinion must be revised. The democratic system was also discussed, such as supporting labor, participating in the war, and substituting farming. The village chief of Chengguan said: "If an order comes in the middle of the night to transfer participants to the war, should we also ask the masses to get up and discuss it first?" (containing the feeling that democracy cannot be done) Through repeated discussions, it was clarified that democracy is not about abandoning leadership, but about strengthening leadership. After the meeting, it was reflected that this meeting should have been held earlier. Li Shunda said: "This time I have a way to lead!" Determined to go back to lead production.

### 平顺召开全县支干会教育党员　树立民主作风领导生产<作者>=林华

　　平顺召开全县支干会教育党员
  　树立民主作风领导生产
  　整过党的支干讲实例，大家摸了底。
  　贫雇农民说真理个别报复不用怕
  　民主是按群众意见办事，不是不要领导。
    【平顺消息】平顺县委于五月十三号召开了全县的支干联席会议，会期三天，到会七百多人。目的在于解决党员思想问题，树立民主作风领导生产，在生产运动中密切党群关系。会议情况如下：１、支干普遍的存在着一种害怕整党的情绪，以为干了十来年啦，没有功劳也有苦劳！不去领导工作，等待下台，等待“过关”。如龙峪沟一个支干说：“见到报纸上说是要整党哩，就想到咱不行啦，不要咱啦！”他们对抽补基点的消息非常注意，有些光听坏，不听好，胡乱猜测，使得干部情绪震荡很厉害。在领导上对支部教育帮助不够，接受党员意见不够，一脚把老基础踢开，更使这种情绪发展。会上领导上说明整党意义，是治病救人，错误分别轻重大小，是改善党与群众关系，并不是故意和党员为难。接着又请虹梯关（基点）支干把他村整党经过详细介绍了一下，以事实使干部们相信了整党政策，并结合自己思想在小组里展开了讨论。如排珩支部书记说：“党要再不整，就弄成党是党群众是群众了。”感到党很需要整。２、贫雇群众说真理，个别人报复不必怕：在接受了整党重要性的基础上，更进一步解决怕提假意见报复的思想。如川底支书郭玉恩说：“有了的事好检讨，要是没有的事提出来真是没法说呀！”中五井郭长生说：我村付奎的意见就不知有多少，本来是群众讨论叫他吃义仓，他硬说是我出的鬼。领导上随即解释了少数不正确意见是能辨别清楚的，由于过去民主不够，这些意见也不足为怪。虹梯关整党开始时曾一度有报复意见，但在第二次整党时报复意见就受到群众的打击。这种生动的事实，解除了支干们的顾虑。３、解决了“保国忠良无下场”的错误思想：开始这种情绪是普遍存在的，在讨论中采用了虹梯关的实例，说明无下场是谁呢？象虹梯关岳凤花是该村最老的党员，包庇地主，随便开除党员，因捉奸逼死了两条人命。这些错误此次整党他都不好好反省，结果被开除党籍。象这种保地主的“忠良”就无下场。如果他有了下场，党和群众就没有下场了。讨论中证明是公私分开，错误分担，是谁的谁负责。只要认真检讨，改正错误，热心为群众办事，群众就会拥护。虹梯关整党初步结束时，就有八九个人要求入党，可见群众对党还是热烈拥护的。事实使大家明确了这一问题。接着讨论领导作风问题，这个问题是干部最苦闷，最难解决的问题，如北头村长黄连柱说：“生产好领导，就是民主不好干。”讨论中明确了民主要求就是群众意见群众要求，如去年秋天的割青庄稼就不是群众要求，尤其是为完成任务突击，更是遭到群众的反对。如去秋县的计划是二十天到二十五天收割完，到区上就成了十五、六天，到村就成了十四天，这样作的结果是群众吃了亏。如何实现民主领导？经讨论是这样：在群众讨论作出正确结论时，一定照办。如少数人不同意，还可以保留他们的意见；在实际运动中如果证明少人数的意见是正确的，就得修改原来意见。又讨论了民主制度，如支差参战代耕等。城关村长说：“如果半夜里来了命令调参战的，是不是也要叫群众先起来讨论呢？”（含有民主无法干的情绪）从反复讨论中，都明确了民主不是不要领导，是为了加强领导。会后反映说：这个会早就该开了。李顺达说：“这回去可有了办法领导啦！”决心回去领导生产。（平顺联合办公室林华）
