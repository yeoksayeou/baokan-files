[Taiyue News] Qinshui Third District convened a meeting of all district teachers and central principals on April 25th to examine the past leftist reckless actions in schools. After three days of examination, it was found that this kind of leftist action was universal. For example, Shang Hongchang, a teacher at Xiaoqingwang School in Shangge District, not only drove six children from his school out of the school gate by using village struggle and confession methods, but also went to Beishan School to conduct struggles. Even the daughters of landlords and rich peasants, who were only seven or eight years old, were also struggled against. Zhangma School not only expelled the sons of landlords and rich peasants from the school but also hung signs on them such as "landlord" and "local tyrant." After the review, a critique was made based on the Border Region Government's instructions on rectifying schools. Finally, it was decided that they must be determined to correct these mistakes in the future, immediately return the confiscated and undistributed items, immediately mobilize the middle peasant children who had been purged to return to school, and admit their mistakes. The children of landlords and rich peasants should also be mobilized to enter school under the principle of education and transformation.

[Taiyue News] On April 29th, the Quwo County Government convened a meeting of central principals, senior primary school principals, and middle school principals to review and correct the "leftist" tendencies in education work. Last July, the county government issued an order to uniformly purge teachers and students from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds. Because the lower levels did not implement it resolutely, a second order was issued in October to resolutely purge them. The Second District purged a total of 23 teachers (three landlords, nine rich peasants, seven middle peasants, and four poor peasants). More students were purged. Schools organized poor peasant groups to struggle against students, seal desks, and confiscate students' stationery and clothing, which were distributed to hired poor students. Under this kind of "leftist" blind action, teachers dared not take responsibility, and education work formed a serious spontaneous flow. Teachers in Tingcheng kowtowed to students because they could not control them. Students from Yingcun, Weicun, and Beidong fought on the river beach with real knives and grenades, and teachers let it go, forming a state of anarchy. Another tendency was to force students to work, which hindered students and caused dissatisfaction at home. Last autumn, students in various villages in the Second District organized mutual aid to harvest crops, only working for others and neglecting their own work. Some villages asked students to deliver letters, firewood, and repair roads, etc., so the masses were unwilling to send their children to school, saying, "How can they study?" Everyone reviewed the above tendencies and resolved to correct them in future work. The county government also explicitly stipulated that senior primary schools should be led by the county government, central principals should be led by the district cultural and educational authorities, and primary schools should be led by the central principals. The appointment, adjustment, suspension, and purging of teachers should be handled directly by the county government, and districts and villages have no right to handle them. It was also decided to abolish the poor and hired peasant groups in schools.

Editor's note: It is good that the Quwo education meeting reviewed the past "leftist" tendencies, but the correction methods are not specific enough. It only mentions abolishing the poor and hired peasant groups in schools (which is necessary), but lacks clear provisions on how to deal with the already purged teachers and students from landlord and rich peasant (and some middle and poor peasant) backgrounds, and the future policy.

　　沁水曲沃等地召开校长教员会
  　检讨学校中左倾错误
    曲沃对错斗师生未提具体处理办法
    【太岳消息】沁水三区于四月二十五日召集全区教员及中心校长会议，检查过去学校里的左倾蛮干行为。经过三天检查发现这种左倾行动是普遍的。如上阁学区小青旺学校教员商鸿昌，除把自己学校的六个儿童用村里斗争坦白等方法一鞭赶出校门外，又去北山学校斗争。连七、八岁的地主富农女儿也被斗争了。张马学校对地主富农儿子除赶出校门外，还给挂上地主、恶霸地主等牌子。检讨后，又根据边府关于整顿学校的指示，作了批判。最后决定：今后要决心改正这些错误，把没收未分的东西立即退还，被清洗的中农子弟立即动员入校，并承认错误。对地主富农子弟，在教育改造原则下，也要动员他们入校。
    【太岳消息】四月二十九日，曲沃县政府召集各中心校长、高小校长、中学校长开会，检讨纠正教育工作中的左倾偏向。去年七月县府曾下令一律清洗地主富农成份的教员学生，因下边执行的不坚决，十月又二次下令坚决清洗，二区前后共清洗教员二十三名（成份是三个地主、九个富农、七个中农、四个贫农），学生被清洗的更多。学校组织贫农团，斗争学生，查封书桌，没收学生的文具、衣物，分给雇贫学生。在这种左倾盲动的情况下，教员不敢负责，教育工作形成严重的自流。听城教员管不住学生，给学生磕头；盈村、卫村与北董学生在河滩上打架背有真刀手榴弹，教员放任不管，形成无政府状态。另一种偏向是强迫学生劳动，妨碍学生，引起家中不满。去秋二区各村学生组织了互助收秋，只给别人干，误了自家活，有的村庄叫学生送信、送柴、修路等等，群众就不愿叫他的子女入学，说：“哪还能念下书？”对上述这些偏向大家都作了检讨，决心在今后工作中纠正。县府又明令规定高小归县府领导，中心校长归区文教领导，小学归中心校长领导，教员委派、调整、停职、清洗，概由县府直接处理，区村无处理权；并决定取消学校中的贫雇组。
    编者意见：曲沃教育会议检查了过去的左倾偏向是好的，但纠正的办法不够具体。只说取消学校中的贫雇组（这是必要的），对已清洗的地主富农（还有一部中贫农）成份的教员学生如何处理及以后的方针都缺乏明确的规定。
