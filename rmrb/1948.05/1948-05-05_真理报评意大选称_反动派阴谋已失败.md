Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd [of the month]: Moscow Dispatch: *Pravda* published an article by Malinin on the results of the Italian election, arguing that the arrogant plan of the domestic reactionaries in Italy to crush the People's Democratic Front and isolate it from the people has completely failed. The author pointed out: "The People's Democratic Front is stronger after the election campaign than it was before the election campaign. It defends sovereignty, freedom, and independence. The People's Democratic Front represents the free and democratic Italy of tomorrow." The author analyzes the election results, saying: The most important feature of this election is that the domestic reactionaries in Italy and their foreign protectors openly launched a joint attack on the People's Democratic Front. They took control of the organization and leadership of the Christian Democratic Party's election campaign. At the head of this "orchestra" was the American representative. At the same time, the Christian Democratic Party used its exclusive and unrestrained control over the administrative organs to make its numerous agents of all kinds completely serve its election forgery. The creation of a certain increase in the number of voters by the Vatican, the re-collection of votes by the reactionary camp, and the systematic use of a set of methods of forgery and fraud in the election. This is the origin of the Christian Democratic Party's so-called "victory" in the election, and the factor of forgery and fraud played a major role.

　　真理报评意大选称
  　反动派阴谋已失败
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报发表马里宁论意大选结果，认为意大利国内反动派企图粉碎人民民主阵线并把它从人民中孤立起来的狂妄计划，已全盘失败。作者指出：“人民民主阵线在选举运动后比它在选举运动前更加强大了，它保卫着主权、自由和独立；代表自由民主的意大利之明天的，便是人民民主阵线。”作者分析这次选举结果说：这次选举的最重要特征，便是意大利国内反动派与其外国保护者，公开向人民民主阵线联合进攻，他们把基督教民主党竞选运动的组织与领导掌握到自己手中，在这“演奏队”中占首位的是美国代表。同时，基督教民主党则利用其对行政机构的独霸与无约束的控制权，使其众多的形形色色的代理人，完全为其选举的伪造服务。梵蒂冈造成的选民数目的某种增加，反动阵营选票的重新集合以及选举中有系统的运用了伪造舞弊的一套办法。这便是基督教民主党所谓选票“胜利”的由来，而伪造舞弊这一因素，则起了主要的作用。
