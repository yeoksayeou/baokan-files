    Chiang Bandit's Press Ganging and Grain Seizure
    Xiuwu Communications
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chiang bandit army (40th Division) coming from Henan Province attempted to conscript soldiers in Qiaobeitou. As soon as they got off the train, they seized any young or middle-aged man they saw, regardless of what they were doing, and immediately changed them into military uniforms. They grabbed people wherever they went along the road. When the villagers heard about this, they all fled, afraid to meet them.

    On April 19th, thirty-seven merchants from the Datong Freight Depot in Qiaobeitou were seized by the 40th Division as soon as they got off the train. Two students from Shuizhai Village were going to Dacha Fort to study. On the way, they encountered these troops who seized them without a word, immediately changed them into military uniforms, and sent them to Jiaozuo. Even sesame cake sellers and laborers repairing blockhouses were taken along the way, so people didn't dare to repair the blockhouses for them anymore.

    According to statistics from April 19th to 24th, more than 300 people were seized from various villages and places and immediately changed into military uniforms to become soldiers. The markets outside the north gate of Muluan Store and in Nan Jia were deserted, and the people didn't dare to go to the markets anymore.

    In addition, according to the 40th Division, they planned to conscript a division's worth of people in these three counties in Hebei (Wuzhi County, Xiuwu County, Bo'ai County). When everyone heard this news, most of the young and middle-aged men fled, frustrating them. Unable to find soldiers everywhere, they recently ordered each Bao to dispatch two strong laborers on an emergency basis, requiring them to be delivered within two days.

    Also, news: The grain shortage in the Chiang-controlled areas is severe. The Chiang bandits disregard the lives of the people, demanding large amounts of grain and money. Anyone who couldn't pay the grain and money was dragged away and beaten half to death. Jingxinzhuang is the poorest and smallest village, with only eighty-odd families in the whole village. The land is also very poor, mostly wasteland where crops don't grow. Most people don't have enough to eat. Recently, the enemy at Yangqiao assigned the village to collect 160 jin of white flour, to be collected within three days. When they couldn't collect it, they tied up the old Bao chief, Jing Zhifu, who was over sixty years old, hung him from a beam, and beat him severely. The old man was beaten so badly that he couldn't move and is still bedridden. The Maqu Bao urgently demanded grain and money. When the people couldn't pay, the Bao chief led troops to search the people's homes, even taking the half jin of flour in the urns. If they couldn't find grain, they would beat and make trouble. Most of the men hid. In Miaoxiaoduan, one family owed the Bao chief eight jin of grain, so the township sent seven people to their house to eat, and said, "After eating your food, you still have to deliver the grain quickly. If you don't give us grain, we'll stay in your house and not leave."

    Due to the Chiang bandits' large-scale demands for grain and money and forced conscription, widespread famine has been created. Most of the masses are not eating their fill, so some local ruffians have formed gangs to issue "tickets" (demands) and intercept roads, doing everything from eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. They eat on the roads day and night, causing roads to be deserted. Merchants west of Nan Jia in Lianghekou don't dare to do business anymore.

    蒋匪抓丁又抢粮
    修获武通讯
    【本报讯】从河南过来的蒋匪军（四十师）到桥北头企图抓兵，所以一下车后，见了青壮年也不问你是干啥的，带起就走，随时就换军装。沿路上走到哪里抓到那里，各村老百姓听到这个情况后，都纷纷逃跑，谁也不敢和他们见面。
    四月十九日，桥北头的大同货栈里边的商人，一下车就被四十师抓走了三十七个。水寨村有两个学生到大茶堡上学，走到半路上，碰见这些队伍不说二话，带起就走，随时换了军装送到焦作。在半路上连卖烧饼的、修炮楼的民夫都带上走，所以炮楼也都不敢去给他修了。
    据十九日到二十四的统计，各村各地共抓走了三百余人，随时都换了军装当兵。木栾店北门外和南贾的两个集市都散了，老百姓谁也不敢到集上去赶集去啦。
    另外，据四十师说，来到河北这三个县（武陟县修武县博爱县），就要抓一师的人数，大家听到这个消息后，大部青壮年都逃跑了，急的他没有办法，到处找抓不到兵，计划最近命令各保派壮丁，强征每保临时急派两个限两日交齐。
    又讯：蒋区粮荒严重，蒋贼不管人民的死活，大量要粮要款，谁交不起粮款拉住就是打个半死。荆新庄是个最穷的村庄，而且又很小，全村八十来家，土地也很坏，大部分都是荒草地不长庄稼，大多数老百姓都没有吃的。最近洋桥上敌人派了该村一百六十斤白面，限三天收齐，收不起来，就把一个六十多岁的老保长荆治福老汉绳捆，绑吊到梁上痛打了一顿，打的老汉不能动弹，到现在还卧床不起，马曲保上着重要粮要款，老百姓出不起，保上带着队伍到老百姓家找寻，连瓮里的斤半面都闹去了。找不到粮食就横打横闹，男人们大部分都躲起来。庙小段，有一家欠保上八斤粮食，乡镇上就派了七个人去他家吃饭，并且说吃了你的饭还得赶快送粮食，不给粮食我们就住在你家不走。
    根据蒋贼的大量要粮要款强征壮丁，造成普遍灾荒，大部分群众都吃不饱饭，所以有些地痞流氓都成群结队到处起票截路，吃喝嫖赌无所不为，不管黑夜白天都在路上吃食，闹的路断人稀，南贾以西两河口的商人都不敢做生意了。
