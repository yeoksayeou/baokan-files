　　Hanshang Village, Yangcheng
  　Correcting the Leftist Errors in Class Designation
  　The Masses Rejoice: "With this booklet, it's as if Chairman Mao is sitting in our home!"
    Hanshang Village in Yangcheng (a village experimented by the District Party Committee) recently re-designated classes, correcting the leftist deviations of the past in the chaotic designation of class status. Hanshang Village has a total of 329 households. In January of this year, 53 households were designated as landlords and rich peasants, accounting for more than 13.5 percent of the total number of households in the village. This time, only four households were designated as landlords (originally 14), and six households as rich peasants (originally 39), accounting for only 2.8 percent of the total number of households.

    Why were so many designated in the past? The reason was that in January of this year, the comrades of the work team did not fully understand our Party's policy on class designation. In addition, the leftist sentiment of the masses at the time, the comrades of the work team followed the masses' lead, and thus could not use the Party's policy to persuade some of the masses with erroneous opinions. Even more seriously, the masses had misunderstandings about the Outline Land Law, having an absolute egalitarian mentality. Regarding the distinction between middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, they looked at whether they exceeded the average landholding of the whole village, and in this way, 82 households were designated as well-to-do middle peasants. Their purpose in designating well-to-do middle peasants was not to protect the middle peasants, but to encroach on them. The poor peasants regarded the well-to-do middle peasants as "second rich peasants," wanting to equalize their land and move their floating assets. Moreover, the method of class designation at that time was also very wrong. Not only was the person concerned not required to be present, but there was also very little democratic discussion. The materials for class designation were mostly general and vague, and some were based on speculation. How could this lead to accurate designation?

    In order to correct the past deviation of wrong designation, the work team decided to re-designate one more time.

    The work of re-designating classes began in early April. First, a relatively detailed mobilization was carried out at the general meeting of the peasant association, clarifying the criteria for class designation and the distinctions between the various classes, emphasizing that class designation should fully promote democracy so that everyone would dare to speak. Only then were several relatively complex households selected to be tried out as examples. The method of designation was to take the natural village as the unit, self-report and public discussion, with the masses and those who had previously been designated as landlords and rich peasants all participating.

    The first to self-report was Ji Zhenkui. Ji Zhenkui had been designated as a landlord in the past. His family had four people and 26 mu of land. In the years of the Republic of China 31 and 32 [1942, 1943], he hired a full-time farmhand. His father participated in incidental labor, and he himself was 16 or 17 years old at the time, capable of working as half a labor unit. The labor of the employer was less than the labor of the employee. But in the 33rd year [1944] (one year before the establishment of the democratic government), he himself was already able to work as a full labor unit, so he did not hire a full-time farmhand, but only hired odd-job workers for about three months. In this year, the labor of the employer was more than the labor of the employee. Ji Zhenkui's father (already dead) was a local bully and gentry in the village, and a member of the Kuomintang. He originally had a Beijing goods store in Yangcheng City, which he squandered away with eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. During the December coup, when the Chiang bandits surrounded the Sacrifice League [a Communist front organization], he had sent people to hunt down and kill anti-Japanese cadres. Zhenkui himself had served as a secretary in the puppet village office for four months in the 33rd year [1944], earning three dou of rice per month.

    After Ji Zhenkui finished his self-report, he identified himself as a rich peasant. Then the masses began to discuss in groups. Middle peasant Hengsheng said that he was a well-to-do middle peasant because he had exploited more in the 31st and 32nd years [1942, 1943], and less in the 33rd year [1944]. Poor peasant Nian Guan also represented a group of people in saying that he was a well-to-do middle peasant. But after a while, poor peasant Haisheng said: "My group of three people disagree. He served as a secretary in the puppet village office in the 33rd year [1944] without performing labor service, so he should be designated as a rich peasant." Then someone else pointed out that his father was a local tyrant and that he should not be judged from the 33rd year [1944]. Someone else said that others were only judged one year back, but he should be judged three years back. At this time, the work team put forward the correct opinions: (1) The employer had already participated in the main labor in the 31st and 32nd years [1942, 1943], and the amount of labor was less than that of the employee, which was enough to meet the conditions for a rich peasant. But by the 33rd year [1944], the employer's labor was already more than the employee's labor. The 33rd year [1944] was the year before the establishment of the democratic government, and the class status should be determined according to this year, so he should be a well-to-do middle peasant, not a rich peasant. This year is the standard, whatever he is, he is. He cannot be judged many years back. (2) His father's bullying behavior and his own service as a secretary in the puppet village office without performing labor service cannot be used as conditions for determining family class status.

    The second household to self-report was Wei Kuanxiu. This household had been designated as a rich peasant in the past. The family had four people and 28 mu of land. In the 32nd year [1943], they hired one worker. The employer was a full labor unit, and the labor of the employer and the employee was the same. In the 33rd year [1944], he was ill and unable to work, and hired a full-time farmhand and a half-labor part-time worker for five months. In the 34th year [1945], they hired a cowherd, equivalent to one-third of a full labor unit. After he recovered from his illness, he still worked himself, and the labor of the employer was two-thirds more than the labor of the employee. The average output per person in the whole family was eight shi, seven dou, and three sheng, which was more than twice the average output of four shi and two dou for middle peasants.

    After Wei Kuanxiu reported himself, most of the masses said that he was a rich peasant, the reason being that his family had been exploiting for many years, his father did not work, and he was a dominant figure in Xigou Village, even scolding people. The comrades of the work team explained to the masses: This family's output exceeded that of the average middle peasant by one time (equivalent to the land exceeding one time), and his calculation of exploitation should be two-thirds less than that of the average person. As long as his exploitation exceeds 12.5 percent (one-eighth) of the total income, he can be designated as a rich peasant. His family's exploitation in the 32nd and 33rd years [1943, 1944] was already more than one-eighth, enough to meet the conditions for a rich peasant, but this kind of exploitation must be continuous for three years to count. In the 34th year [1945], he only hired a cowherd, and the exploitation was less than one-eighth. The rich peasant's exploitation income did not last for three consecutive years, so he cannot be designated as a rich peasant.

    In this way, classes were designated and explained with practical examples, and the masses also initially learned.

    Then, taking the neighborhood as the unit, the methods of self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic discussion were adopted. First, the class status of those who had been designated as landlords and rich peasants last time was formally designated. The materials about each family were collected relatively fully. Each family was investigated three or five times, and after public discussion by the masses, the work team studied them, then took them back to pass the mass evaluation, and finally determined the class status of each family. As a result of this designation, only four landlord households and six rich peasant households were designated in the whole village, which was several times less than the previous 53 households.

    In the democratic class designation, it was found that the number of targets of struggle had been increased in the past because there were the following eight mistakes in the designation criteria: (1) Some peasants originally had some slight exploitation or occasional exploitation, such as hiring a young man or using some odd jobs, etc., but generally did not exceed 25 percent of the total income, but because their families had more livestock, farm tools, and grain, seven households were wrongly designated as landlords and rich peasants. (2) Some peasants had served as leaders of the community or village chiefs in the old society or had worked as labor heads for the Japanese, bullying the people. The masses were dissatisfied with him, and because of this, seven peasants were wrongly designated as landlords and rich peasants. (3) Some peasants personally participated in the main labor and did business by the way, and there were hired workers in the family, but the feudal exploitation did not exceed 25 percent. The masses thought that it was not good for him to do business and labor at the same time, and five households were wrongly designated as landlords and rich peasants. (4) Some had lived the life of a landlord very early, and some had not been exploiting and participated in the main labor for more than ten years before the establishment of the democratic government, using this to chase history and designate three households as landlords and rich peasants. (5) Some former village cadres did not exploit themselves, but because their work style was not good and they had oppressed the masses, the masses wrongly designated three households as rich peasants in order to retaliate. (6) Some had previously had greater exploitation enough to meet the conditions of a rich peasant, but later, due to the devastation of the Japanese invaders or the impact of rent reduction and interest reduction, they had not been exploiting for five years, but the family had not collapsed yet, and because of this, five households were wrongly designated as landlords and rich peasants. (7) In terms of exploitation, sometimes the conditions for a rich peasant were met, but not continuously for three years, and ten households were designated as rich peasants in this way. (8) There were also two households who were designated as rich peasants because they had been ill for a long time or the main labor force had died, losing their ability to work, and there was no way to use hired workers. These wrongly designated components have been corrected this time.

    The masses are very satisfied with this re-designation. Middle peasant Xiao Xi said: "Listening to people read the booklet (referring to the draft class designation), I feel really happy in my heart; with this booklet, it's as if Chairman Mao is sitting in our home." Turned-over peasant Wang Zhuang said: "This class designation is good, it doesn't expand (meaning it doesn't wrong) good people." What the masses support most is the labor viewpoint that runs through the policy, in the words of the masses, that is, "not erasing labor." Poor peasant Ji Desheng said: "Not erasing labor is the first thing." Now they are designating classes for the masses.

### 阳城汉上村　纠正划成份的左倾错误　群众欢喜的说：“有这个本本，就和毛主席坐在咱家里一样！”

　　阳城汉上村
  　纠正划成份的左倾错误
  　群众欢喜的说：“有这个本本，就和毛主席坐在咱家里一样！”
    阳城汉上村（区党委实验村），最近重新划阶级，纠正了以前乱划成份的左倾偏向。汉上村共三百二十九户人家，今年一月就划了地主富农五十三户，占全村户数百分之十三点五还多。这次划下来，只划了四户地主（原划的是十四户），六户富农（原划了三十九户），只占全户数百分之二点八。
    过去为甚划的那样多呢？原因是今年一月工作组的同志没有完全懂得我党划阶级的政策，加上当时群众的左倾情绪，工作组的同志做了群众的尾巴，这样就不能依照党的政策来说服一部分群众中的错误意见。更严重的是群众对土地法大纲有误解，有绝对平均思想，对于中农和富裕中农的区别，是看他是不是超过全村土地的平均数，就这样划出八十二户富裕中农。他们划富裕中农的目的，不是为了保护中农，而是为了侵犯中农，贫农是把富裕中农当成“二富农”来看的，要平他们的土地，动他们的浮财。还有，当时划阶级的办法也很错误，既不要本人出席，也很少民主讨论，划成份的材料也多半是笼笼统统的，还有些是猜想的，这样怎么会划的正确呢？
    工作组为要纠正过去错划的偏向，便决定重新划一次。
    重划阶级的工作在四月初开始，先在农会会员大会上作了比较详细的动员，把划阶级标准和各阶级的区别都讲清楚，强调划成份要充分发扬民主，使人人都敢说话，这才选出几家较复杂的户来试划一下做个榜样。划的方法是以自然村为单位，自报公议，群众和以前被划成地主富农的人都参加。
    开头是姬镇魁自报，姬镇魁过去是划成地主的，家里有四口人，二十六亩地，民国三十一、二年雇用长工一个，他父亲参加附带劳动，本人当时十六、七岁，能顶半个劳动力，雇主的劳力比雇工的劳力要少。可是在三十三年（民主政府建立前一年），他本人已能顶个全劳动力，就没雇长工只雇零工大约有三个月，这一年雇主的劳动力就比雇工的劳动力要多。姬镇魁的父亲（已死）是村里的豪绅，是国民党员，原在阳城城里有京货铺，吃喝嫖赌浮荡空了。十二月政变时，蒋匪包围牺盟会，他曾派人追杀过抗日干部。镇魁本人三十三年在伪村公所当过四个月书记，每月赚三斗米。
    姬镇魁自报完了，便自认是富农，接着群众便分组圪嚷。中农恒盛说他是富裕中农，因三十一、二年剥削多，三十三年剥削就少了。贫农碾管也代表一堆群众说他是富裕中农。可是停了一会，贫农海声说：“我这一堆三个人不同意，他三十三年在伪村公所当书记不支差，应划成富农。”接着又有人提出他父亲是恶霸，不能从三十三年看。还有人说别人名下只往前推一年，他名下就得推三年。这时工作组就提出正确的意见：（一）雇主三十一、二年已参加主要劳动，劳动份量比雇工少，够个富农条件。但到三十三年雇主劳动已比雇工劳动多了，三十三年是民主政府成立的前一年，照这一年决定成份，就应该是富裕中农，不是富农；这一年就是个标准，是啥就是啥，不能往前多推。（二）父亲有恶霸行为，自己在伪村公所当书记不支差，不能作为决定家庭成份的条件。
    第二户自报的是卫宽袖，这一户过去订的是富农，家有四口人，廿八亩地，三十二年雇工一个，雇主是全劳动，雇主雇工劳力一样。三十三年本人害病不能劳动，雇了一个长工和一个半劳力的月工五个月。三十四年雇用放牛孩一个，顶全劳力三分之一。自己病好以后还是自己劳动，雇主比雇工劳动要多三分之二。全家每人平均产量八石七斗三，比起中农平均数四石二的产量要多出一倍以上。
    卫宽袖自报以后，群众大部都说是富农，理由是他家连年剥削，他父亲不劳动，在西沟村是统治人物，还骂人。工作组同志便向群众讲明：这家产量超过一般中农一倍（等于土地超过一倍），他的剥削算法应比一般的少二分之一，只要他的剥削超过总收入的百分之十二点五（八分之一），就可划成富农。他家三十二、三年的剥削已经比八分之一多，够个富农条件，但是这种剥削要连续三年才算。他家在三十四年只雇了个放牛孩，剥削不到八分之一，富农的剥削收入没有连续三年，不能划成富农。
    就这样用实际的例子划阶级、讲阶级，群众也初步学会了。
    接着就以闾为单位，采取自报公议，民主讨论的方法，先正式划上次划成地主富农的成份。关于各家的材料，搜集的比较充分，每家都是经过三番五次的调查，又让群众公议以后，工作组才加以研究，再拿去通过群众评定，最后才确定了各家的成份。这样划的结果，全村只划了四户地主、六户富农，比起从前五十三户来要少好几倍。
    在民主划成份中，发现以前把斗争对象划多了，是因为在划的标准上有以下八个错处：（一）有些农民原来有点轻微剥削或偶然有点剥削，如雇个小伙计用些零工等，但一般都不超过总收入百分之二十五，可是因为他们家里牲口、农具、粮食比较多，错划成地主、富农的七户。（二）有些农民在旧社会当过社首、村长或给日本人当过苦力头，欺负人民，群众对他不满，因为这把农民划成地主富农的七户。（三）有些农民本人参加主要劳动捎带做生意，家里有雇工，但封建剥削不超过百分之二十五，群众认为他兼做生意劳动不好，错划成地主富农的有五户。（四）有的很早过过地主生活，在民主政府成立前一年有的还在前十多年，就已没有剥削，参加主要劳动，这样追历史追成地主、富农的有三户。（五）有些过去的村干部，本人没有剥削，但因作风不好，欺压过群众，群众为了报复，错划成富农成份的有三户。（六）很早以前有较大的剥削够上富农条件，后来因日寇糟害或受减租减息影响，五年以前已不剥削了，但家庭还没垮下来，因这错划成地主富农的五户。（七）拿剥削来说，有时够个富农条件，但还没有连续三年，这样划成富农的有十户。（八）还有两户因为害病很久或主要劳动的人死了，丧失了劳动力，没办法用了雇工，也划成了富农成份。这些错划的成份，都在这次纠正了。
    这次重划成份群众很满意，中农小喜说：“听人家圪念本本（指划阶级草案），心里实在痛快；有这个本本，就象毛主席坐在咱家里一样。”翻身农民旺壮说：“这次划成份好，不扩大（不冤枉的意思）好人。”群众顶拥护的是贯穿在政策里的劳动观点，用群众的话来说，就是“不抹煞劳动”。贫农姬德生说：“不抹煞劳动这是头一条。”现在他们正在给群众划阶级。
