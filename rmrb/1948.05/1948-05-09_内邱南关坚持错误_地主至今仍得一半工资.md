　　Neiqiu Nanguan Persists in Error
  　Landlords Still Receive Half Wages
    [This newspaper dispatch] A report from the Joint Office of Neiqiu County regarding the spring sowing situation in Nanjie states: On the evening of April 23rd, the new production committee of Nanjie held a meeting attended by all four group leaders and ten team leaders of the village, summarizing and reviewing the previous phase of spring plowing and sowing. According to the reports from each team, a total of 533.2 mu had been sown in the entire street, with 53.5 mu remaining unsown. The completion of this sowing was achieved through the mobilization of labor and livestock, ensuring that idle individuals and animals were not left unused. The groups coordinated with each other, and all spring land was sown together without equivalent compensation. With the exception of the Wang Peiying team, where peasants received one sheng of wages for food per day of labor and "feudal elements" received half a sheng, the other three groups cultivated without compensation. The spring land was generally harrowed three times and plowed twice. The land of widowed and orphaned households and the families of military personnel and cadres was also cultivated without compensation; only seeds were provided, without any wage payments. There was no work point recording or assigning, and no work tickets were used, with the principle being to not let the land go uncultivated. The method was to coordinate households with labor but no livestock and households with livestock but no labor. Households with neither labor nor livestock were given assistance without compensation as long as they participated in the mutual aid group. In this way, all sowing was completed in less than twenty days. The issue of mutual aid was the subject of the longest debate, especially the lack of equivalent compensation and work point recording during this phase of spring plowing and sowing, which was felt to be a shortcoming. Chen Yuqin said, "If wages are not handled well and mutual aid is not handled well, it won't work. But since there's not much other work now, no one says anything about helping someone for a day or two if they have labor and livestock." Chen Decai said, "To be honest, a day or half a day doesn't matter much, but no one wants to be taken advantage of all the time. No one mentioned it this year, some people feel they are taking a small loss and just don't bring it up, but last year they used work tickets to record points, and each group was very clear." Shen Renyi said, "Last year, everyone said that our group's wages were a muddle, and the ones who were owed wages were all impoverished households, so there was no way to ask for it." Qiu Xiaochun said, "Being muddled is not right, accounts should be settled as they should be. If you can't pay now, you can count it as owed, and make sure that the gains and losses are clear." In the end, everyone agreed that muddling through would not consolidate mutual aid. Then, they discussed whether it was okay to reduce the wages of those who had been struggled against by half. Wang Peiying said, "They definitely can't be the same as the peasants." Shen Renyi said, "I think those who have reformed well can be the same as the peasants, and those who haven't can be treated differently. If you make good livestock work without letting them eat grass, how can they have the strength? If they are working, they should be allowed to eat, and they should earn what they earn, so they can be used regularly." In the end, everyone said, "As long as they labor well, they should get the same wages as our peasants."
    Editor's Note: This report shows that in the sowing in Nanjie, Neiqiu, some groups still adhere to "leftist" errors, giving half-price wages to "feudal elements" (this term may include middle peasants). The Joint Office did not criticize this arbitrary failure to implement policy regulations at all. Later, during the review, some masses were filled with "leftist" sentiments (such as comparing landlords to livestock), and the leadership did not provide any education or persuasion. Finally, they admitted that wages should be the same, but still separated the so-called "well-reformed" from the "not well-reformed," which is also wrong.

### 内邱南关坚持错误　地主至今仍得一半工资

　　内邱南关坚持错误
  　地主至今仍得一半工资
    【本报消息】内邱县联合办公室报导南街互助下种情形称：四月廿三日晚上，南街召开新的生产委员会，有全村四个大组长和十个小组长参加，总结检查前一段春耕下种工作。经各组汇报，全街共完成下种五百卅三亩二，未种地还有五十三亩五。这次下种的完成，是劳畜力齐动员，闲人不闲牲口，以组为单位互相调剂，凡是春地一齐下种，没等价。除王培英组农民一个劳力管饭一天一升工资米，封建势力一天半升外，其余三个大组都是无代价的耕种。春地普遍耙了三遍，翻了两犁，特别是孤寡户和军干属的地，也都无代价耕种，只送去种子，不出分毫工资。没有记工订分，也没有实行工票，目的是以放不过这场垧为原则。办法是有劳力没牲口户和有牲口没劳力户互相调剂，没劳力也没牲口的户，只要是参加了互助组，无代价的去帮忙，就这样作到了在不到二十天中，连耕代种全部下种。关于互助问题，争论的时间最长，特别是对这一阶段春耕下种互不等价、互不记工，都感到是一个缺点。陈玉芹说：“工资闹不好，互助闹不好，不过因现在没啥别的活，有劳力有牲口，给谁帮个一天两天忙，谁也不说那。”陈德才说：“说实话吧，一天半天没啥，亏谁也不愿常吃，今年都没提，有些人感到吃点亏也就不提了，提了看着很薄气，去年使工票记分，各组闹的很清楚。”申仁义说：“去年总说吧，俺组工资是糊涂汤，欠工资都是困难户，也没法要。”邱小春说：“糊涂不对，帐应怎算就怎算，当下给不起可算个欠户，吃亏沾光到明处。”最后大家都认为糊涂经糊涂念，互助不能巩固。接着又研究了减半给被斗户工资好不好？王培英说：“怎也不能和农民一样。”申仁义说：“我看转变的好的，可以和农民一样，不好的可以两样看待。如使好牲口不叫他吃草料，光叫他给拉，怎能有劲？他给干活该叫他吃就叫他吃，该挣就挣，垮不了经常能用。”最后大家都说：“他只要好好劳动，和咱农民一块工资一样。”
    编者按：这个报导，说明内邱南街在下种中，有的组仍然坚持左倾错误，对“封建势力”（这一名词内可能包括有中农），给以半价工资。而联合办公室对这种随意不执行政策规定的现象，一字没有批评。后来检讨时，有些群众充满左倾情绪（如把地主比做使牲口等），也未见领导上进行任何教育说服。最后承认工资应该一样，但仍分开所谓“转变好”与“转变不好”，这也是不对的。
