　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th—Chairman Lin Boqu of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has led the first-level organs of the Border Region to return victoriously to Yan'an. On the evening of the 13th, the Yan'an Prefectural Committee, the Commissioner's Office, and the Yan'an Municipal Government held a welcoming meeting in the auditorium of the Border Government. Chairman Lin rose to speak amidst thunderous applause. He began by saying, "When we withdrew from Yan'an last year, Chairman Mao told us that although we were temporarily leaving Yan'an, Yan'an would always belong to the people. Over the past year, under the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao, the brilliant command of Deputy Commander Peng, and the leadership of the Northwest Bureau, we finally defeated the Hu bandits' offensive and returned victoriously." This veteran revolutionary, who had resolutely fought alongside the people of northern Shaanxi for a year, repeatedly warned everyone in a loud voice: "Our return to Yan'an is something to be proud of, but we must not forget that the Chiang Hu bandit gang has not been completely eliminated. The Border Region has been damaged by the Chiang Hu bandit army, and the people's economy urgently needs to be restored. We should shoulder this major responsibility, make production even better, and not fall behind in previous years. We must fully support the front lines. Only in this way can we win more victories on the front lines and eliminate more enemies." Chairman Lin finally said excitedly: "Tonight's gala marks the heroic struggle of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for more than a year. In the future, we must have more killing of the enemy at the front and better production in the rear, so that we can victoriously shoulder and complete the great task of liberating the Northwest." The conference concluded with the West Workers' Troupe performing Yangko dance to add to the fun, and the festivities continued until late at night.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th—After regaining their liberation, the farmers of Yan'an are striving to produce in order to restore the wounds of war. Zao Yuan Village in the western district of Yan'an City, where Chairman Mao once lived, has more than 800 mu of paddy fields, of which more than 700 mu have been sown with crops such as corn, millet, hemp, and vegetables. The remaining land is also being actively sown. The Xiaobian沟 area in the northern suburbs of Yan'an City has also begun to implement a plan to restore the 600-plus mu of cultivated land it had in 1946. The Xiaobian沟 Township government has also distributed ten hoes and twenty-six plowshares to farmers lacking agricultural tools. After mutual assistance and regulation within the villages of Nanyaozi Mojiawan and other villages in the district, the problem of food for some of the grain-deficient masses has been solved. In the hometown of the famous labor hero Wu Manyou—Wujiazaoyuan in the Liulin District of Yan'an County—29 peasant households have returned to rebuild their homes, including 12 households of refugees who have newly arrived after the war. At present, the new and old households in the village have formed seven mutual aid teams, and they are going out to produce, planning to cultivate 82 percent (1,090 mu) of the pre-war cultivated area within one month. According to statistics from the 10th of this month, 610 mu have been cultivated, accounting for 56 percent of the spring plowing plan. The village recently held a villagers' meeting to discuss production work, and decided to allocate some of the land of the organs to solve the land difficulties of the masses, and to appropriately solve the difficulties of the newly arrived refugees. Six refugee households have joined with the villagers in farming or working as laborers, and the remaining ones who lack seeds or food are solving their difficulties by earning wages through part-time labor.

    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁边区政府林伯渠主席已率边区一级机关胜利返回延安。十三日晚，延属地委、专署、延安市政府，于边府大礼堂召开欢迎大会，林主席在雷动掌声中起立讲话。他首先说：“去年我们撤出延安时，毛主席就告诉我们，虽然我们暂时离开延安，但延安永远是人民的。一年来边区在毛主席英明战略指导彭副总司令的天才指挥以及西北局领导下，我们终于打垮了胡匪的进攻，而胜利地回来了。”这位曾与陕北人民一起坚决斗争一年之久的革命长者，以宏亮的声音重复地告诫大家：“我们回到延安是值得骄傲的，但不要忘记蒋胡匪帮还未彻底消灭，边区遭蒋胡匪军破坏，人民经济亟待恢复，我们应该把这一重大责任担负起来，把生产搞得更好，不能落后于往年，全力支援前线，只有这样，我们在前线就可以打更多胜仗，消灭更多敌人。”林主席最后兴奋的说：“今天的晚会，标志着陕甘宁边区一年多来英勇奋斗的战绩。今后就是要前方更多杀敌，后方更好生产，让我们胜利的担负并完成解放大西北的伟大任务。”大会最后由西工团演奏秧歌助兴，至深夜始尽欢而散。
    【新华社西北二十五日电】延安农民在重获解放后，正为恢复战争创伤而奋力生产。毛主席曾经居住过的延市西区枣园村，有水田八百多亩，其七百多亩已播种玉蜀黍、谷、麻、菜疏等作物，其余土地亦在积极播种中。延市北郊小砭沟恢复一九四六年耕地面积六百多亩的计划，亦已开始。小砭沟乡政府并以十把镢头二十六页铧分给缺乏农具之农民。该区南窑子磨家湾等村在本村进行互助调剂后，部分缺粮群众的吃粮问题已获解决，著名劳动英雄吴满有的家乡——延安县柳林区吴家枣园已有二十九户农民返回重整家园，其中有十二户系战后新来的难民，目前该村新老户已组成七个变工队，出动生产，计划在一个月内耕种战前耕地面积的百分之八十二（一○九○亩）。据本月十日的统计：已耕种六百一十亩，占春耕计划百分之五十六。该村最近曾召开村民大会讨论生产工作，决定抽出部分机关土地解决群众土地困难，对新来难民的困难，也加以适当解决，计六户难民与本村农民伙种或揽工，其余缺籽种或食粮的，则以半揽工赚工资等办法解决其困难。
