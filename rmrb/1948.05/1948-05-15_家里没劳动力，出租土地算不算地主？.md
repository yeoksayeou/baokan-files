    Is Renting Out Land Considered Landlord if There is No Labor Force at Home?
    
    Editor:
    
    In Dongbao Village, there is a household that, according to population, land, exploitative relationships, and history, is definitely a landlord. The family consists of a blind person, an idiot, a child, and a partially blind person. After class designation, all property was confiscated. According to the Land Law, landlords are also entitled to a share, but they cannot cultivate the land due to lack of labor. Can they rent it out? If renting is still exploitation, are they still considered landlords? In addition, regarding their current living situation, the family cannot produce anything. Can they be provided with fruit and grain as relief? If not, how should it be resolved?
    
    The masses believe they are landlords, but some people feel sympathy because their property was confiscated. Could they be taxed as rich peasants instead?

    This household may not necessarily be a landlord. If they are only renting out land due to disability and their living conditions have been difficult and below the level of ordinary middle peasants for more than three consecutive years, they should not be considered landlords. If their living standards exceed those of ordinary middle peasants, only then should they be considered landlords. According to the Land Law, after receiving their due share of land and property, they are allowed to rent it out if they lack labor. After land distribution, their land and property ownership will not exceed that of ordinary middle peasants, and although there is exploitation, they should not be considered landlords according to regulations. Those without a fixed occupation or who have lost their labor force should be considered poor peasants. Those with other occupations should have their class status determined by their occupation. This household is either not a landlord or is a poor peasant; it can never be a rich peasant because no one participates in major agricultural labor. Regarding their current living situation, they can be provided with fruit and grain as relief because even if they are landlords, they are entitled to a share of property, and grain is also property.

    When organizing the peasant representative conference, there are still some people in the village who have not joined the peasant association. These are people with problems in the village, such as hooligans, those who served as puppet soldiers, poor and lower-middle peasants whose political issues have not been clarified, relatively large lazybones, and former landlords and rich peasants who have been downgraded to middle peasants after five years of labor reform for landlords and three years of ceasing exploitation for rich peasants. Should these people participate in the election and join the groups, or not? How should these people be handled when organizing the peasant representative conference?

    The peasant representative conference is not an “organization” like the peasant association or the poor peasant league; it is the highest authority in the countryside. Everyone with civil rights, regardless of whether they have joined the peasant association, can participate in the election of peasant representative conference delegates.
    
    Also: According to Chairman Mao's speech in Jin-Sui, in villages and towns where residents are not entirely peasants, it should be called a “People's Representative Conference” instead of a “Peasant Representative Conference.”
    
    We would like to ask you a question: According to what principles are the hooligans you mentioned defined, and why are you not following the central government's class designation decisions? Also, regarding those with “political issues that have not been clarified,” why have you not removed their labels according to the Central Bureau's instructions? Please reply.

### 家里没劳动力，出租土地算不算地主？

    家里没劳动力，出租土地算不算地主？
    编辑同志：
    董堡村有一户按人口、土地、按剥削关系、按历史肯定是地主，家内一个瞎子、一个傻子、一个小孩、一个半瞎子。经划阶级后财产全部没收，按土地法规定地主也同样有一份，但没劳力不能耕种，是否可以出租？出租仍是剥削，是否还算地主？另外目前生活问题，一家人不能生产，是否可以用果实粮接济？如不能又应如何解决？
    群众认为是地主，但按地主没收，群众有些不同情，是否可以按富农征收？
        元氏七区董堡村工作组董堡村工作组：
    这一户不一定是地主。如果只是因为残废，才不得不出租土地，而且生活困难不及一般中农已连续三年以上，就不应认为地主；如果生活超过一般中农，才能认为地主。按土地法的规定，分得其应得的一份土地财产后，没有劳力是可以出租的；土地分配后，土地财产占有状况就不会超过一般中农，虽有剥削，按规定也不应认为地主，其没一定职业或丧失劳动力者，认为贫民；有其他职业者，按其职业决定成份。这户不是地主就是贫民，决不可能是富农，因为没有人参加主要农业劳动。目前生活问题，是可以用果实粮接济的，因为即使他是地主，也要分得一份财产，粮食也是财产。
              ——编者编辑同志：
    组织农代会时，村中还有一部分未参加农会的人，就是村上有些问题的，如流氓、当过伪军、政治问题未搞清楚的中贫农、比较大的懒汉、以前是地富，按地主参加劳动五年变成份，富农停止剥削三年变成份，这些人已下降成中农，这部分人是否也参加选举和参加小组，还是不参加？这些人在组织农代会时应该如何处理？
              武乡联合办公室武乡联合办公室：
    农代会不是象农会、贫农团那样的“组织”，是农村中的最高权力机关。一切有公民权的人，不管他是否参加农会都可以参加选举农代会代表。
    又：按毛主席在晋绥的讲话，在居民不完全是农民的村镇，应称“人民代表会议”而不称“农代会”。
    我们愿意向你提出一个问题：你们提到的流氓是按照什么原则规定的，为什么不按中央划阶级决定去做？又如“政治问题未搞清楚的”，你们为什么不按中央局指示给他们摘下帽子？请复。
