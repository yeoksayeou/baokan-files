Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th: The People's Liberation Army conquered Cangshang Town, 25 li southwest of Changle, on the afternoon of the 1st. With this victory, the entire Chang (Changle), Wei (Weixian), and An (Qiu) region is declared liberated. The majority of the bandit troops defending Cangshang were annihilated during their attempted breakout, with a small number scattering. Our local military and civilians are currently searching for and capturing them.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 10th: A "Ever Victorious" company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army achieved a victory with fewer troops against a larger enemy force in the battle for the East City of Weixian. The entire company captured over 500 prisoners, destroyed five enemy strongholds, and seized 24 light and heavy machine guns, four small cannons, seven submachine guns, and over 200 rifles and pistols. After the battle commenced, the entire company swiftly advanced along East Guan Street, penetrating the enemy's heart and severing their formation. Squad Leader Wang Zhizhen of the 1st Platoon led a squad and a machine gun team to approach the enemy's first stronghold in Anqiu Alley covertly. After personally observing the terrain, Wang decided against using explosives and instead opted for a sudden and fierce assault, ultimately annihilating the entire defending enemy battalion headquarters and one company within the three large buildings, capturing over 150 bandits alive. The 3rd Platoon attacked another enemy building along North-South Street. Soldier Jiang Mingxun consecutively blasted two breaches. Squad Leader Li Guangchen of the 7th Squad then led his entire squad in an assault, capturing an entire enemy platoon alive. During the attack on the enemy's Central Bank stronghold, the 3rd Platoon Leader gathered the squad leaders to study the terrain and tactical maneuvers, concentrating the wisdom of the masses to decide on the attack method. As a result, they rapidly penetrated the enemy's position, capturing over 20 enemy soldiers with no casualties on their own side. Throughout the battle, the entire company conscientiously observed battlefield discipline. Vice Squad Leader Gu Yukun's shoe was torn, and his foot was pierced. Although the battlefield was littered with many new shoes abandoned by the enemy, he never took a single pair. Li Rengao picked up a pair of socks from a pile of enemy corpses and put them on his feet, but then realized it was wrong. He immediately went to the platoon leader, took off the socks, and made a self-criticism. The soldiers of the entire company fought for a whole day without eating. Although they seized a large number of canned goods, no one touched them.
