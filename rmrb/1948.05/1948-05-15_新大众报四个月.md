    Four Months of the New Masses Daily
    The New Masses Daily has been published for four months. What experiences have we gained in these four months? This question is still difficult to answer. It is true that, in terms of each section, we have learned some methods in our work. For example, in news reporting, at first, we mostly rewrote news from the People's Daily, item by item. Later, we felt that this was not working. Most district and village cadres, although they could not fully understand the news from the People's Daily, knew the general meaning. Rewriting it again was like telling them what they already knew, which was not very meaningful. We then gradually changed our approach, systematically introducing the war situation and major domestic and international events, writing in a more complete and coherent manner to systematize the news. Sometimes, we also combined general current affairs knowledge with the news. This approach, as it seems now, is more suitable for our readers. What they lack is various kinds of general knowledge. Because they do not understand a term or a place name, they often cannot fully understand a piece of news. Also, for example, in the third section, we compiled fragmentary materials sent by readers into columns such as "Opinions," "Mailbox," and "Self-Study Room," and added various special columns according to the content of the submissions to diversify the layout, while expanding the writing scope of the readers. But whether these methods can be introduced as experiences, we are still not sure. I thought about it, and if we really want to talk about experiences, we probably have to look for them in the places where the work was done poorly. The following is a narrative from the beginning.
  I. Communicating the Party's Policies to the Masses
    The first issue of the New Masses Daily was to publicize the Land Law Outline and various documents after the Central Bureau's land conference. This was followed by the publicity of Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and the Central Committee and Central Bureau's instructions on filling gaps, rectifying the Party, and promoting democracy. Now we are publicizing Chairman Mao's speech in Jin-Sui and the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting "leftist" errors. For four months, publicizing the Party's policies to the masses has become the main content of the New Masses Daily. All news, articles, Q&As, mailboxes, folk rhymes, etc., are written around this main content. Looking back on this main task now, some aspects were done very poorly. The reason is that the editors had a blurred class viewpoint in the past. After the Party rectification, they leaned to the other extreme, carrying "leftist" emotions to study the Party's policies, so that when publicizing the land conference documents, they could not grasp the spirit and were prone to distorting the interpretation, such as rewriting the "Letter to Party Members." Furthermore, they lacked understanding of the situations and work in various places, blindly emphasizing the poor and hired peasants, and were even less able to combine the Party's policies with specific situations. The work was not done well, and the review gave us this lesson: the New Masses Daily is supported by the masses because it mainly publicizes and interprets the Party's policies. Precisely because it has to rewrite many policies to make them understandable to the masses, it is easy to make mistakes if we do not carefully study and conscientiously grasp the spirit of the policies. A newspaper that speaks directly to the masses, with a current circulation of nearly 50,000 copies, makes a big mistake if it misinterprets policies. From this point, we feel that the popularization of the New Masses Daily is nothing else but the correct publicity of the Party's policies, speaking without distortion, so that everyone understands the spirit of the policies and acts accordingly. The following examples can illustrate:
    According to the reports of the Taihang New China Daily, in some villages in She County and Shahe County, Taihang, because of the pursuit of three generations and the "dian dou lu" during the three-check campaign last year, and the establishment of poor peasant associations without the leadership of work teams last winter, resulting in random designation of class status and wrong struggles against middle peasants, everyone's morale was low during this year's production. After the Central Bureau's instruction on February 1st was published, the New Masses Daily specifically explained the issues of class demarcation and uniting with middle peasants in this instruction, one by one. The article "Must Delineate Class Statuses Carefully" played a considerable role in these villages. The middle peasants in these villages originally thought that class status was difficult to determine and were always worried about not being accurately classified. After reading this article, their morale gradually stabilized. Similarly, in Feixiang County, Ji'nan, our reporters read the articles publicizing the Land Law to the masses. After listening, the masses asked to keep the newspaper, saying, "This gives us a basis, keep it so that we can act according to it in the future." After reading the article on class demarcation, the masses heard that it was decided by the Central Committee and wanted to follow it. They said, "This is great, the work team members who came in the past each had their own yardstick, and we couldn't figure it out. Now we all do it according to the yardstick given by Chairman Mao, and the common people understand it and won't make mistakes." Examples like these illustrate that the masses want to master the Party's policies. Because the original instructions contained a lot of content, they couldn't remember them and asked for each issue to be explained one by one; if there were places in the instructions that they couldn't understand, they asked for specific explanations. The New Masses Daily is doing it this way, so not only has the circulation increased, from less than 10,000 copies to nearly 50,000 copies in three months, but many masses and district and village cadres also regard it as a "basis" and act according to what is said in the newspaper.
  II. Collecting the Problems of the Masses
    The New Masses Daily is a mass newspaper. Since it is a mass newspaper, the broad masses should be in communication with the newspaper and reflect their problems at any time. We have also had twists and turns in this regard.
    When the New Masses Daily was published, due to our blind "leftist" emotions, we thought that the correspondents of the New Masses Magazine in the past were all unreliable and wanted to kick away the "old organization" and cultivate so-called poor and hired peasant backbones. Later, we conducted a survey among the correspondents and found that the vast majority of the past correspondents were of laboring peasant origin and were all worker-peasant correspondents. In the survey forms, the correspondents described in detail their origins, class status, and the changes in the villages where they worked or lived over the past few years. From these situations, it can be seen that in the old revolutionary base areas of Taihang, feudalism has been basically eliminated, and the class status of cadres is generally good, but they often occupy too much fruit and their work style is not democratic. Because of these surveys, the emotions that we initially thought that each village was completely dark gradually turned around. Later, the instructions from the Central Bureau came down and confirmed that these surveys were reliable. We therefore thought that many readers and correspondents are very enthusiastic about the newspaper, but they just can't write articles for the time being. In the past, we insisted on them writing, giving them topics and outlines, and then neglected them when they couldn't write well for a while. This made it impossible for this large part of readers and correspondents to communicate with the newspaper, and the situations in each village and the problems among the masses could not reach us more. In liaison work, we should give more and demand less from the correspondents, but less does not mean none. How to enable readers and correspondents to provide information, and after a policy is issued, it is necessary to conduct some surveys among readers, especially among correspondents.
    In addition to news articles and surveys of readers, our biggest source of understanding the situation now is "Answering All Questions." In April, we received an average of eighty letters a day, and one-third or even one-half of them were questions. These questions are very rich in content and can often raise new situations, enabling us to pay attention to the sufferings of various places in a timely manner. In addition, when a directive from the Party is issued, what difficulties do district and village cadres have in implementing it, and what doubts do the masses still have? More can also be understood from the questions raised by readers. Even at a certain time, when something causes unease among the masses, the questions we receive are mostly of this kind. Due to the limited space in the newspaper, many questions cannot be published. Now, we are trying our best to answer by letter so that all readers can tell the newspaper about their difficulties. We feel that only by understanding the situation more can we better implement the Party's policies. The broad readers are the source of our understanding of the situation. How to make them write about the sufferings of the masses and the problems among the masses and send them to us at any time. In addition to news articles, we have only done the above two points.
  III. Everyone Reads, Everyone Does
    In summary, in four months of work, we have only touched on this one point: understanding the situation and communicating and interpreting policies according to the demands of the masses. This step has not been done well yet. As for the second step, concentrating new mass opinions and insisting on implementing policies, it is even worse. To do these two steps of work well in the future, in addition to asking the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau for more instructions and strengthening research to avoid making mistakes in policies, we must also work hard to solve the problem, which is "Everyone Reads, Everyone Does." In the past, we only wanted to do a good job in liaison work to get readers to write articles. This is important, but it can't be said that we have done enough. The reason why the New Masses Daily was able to publish so many copies in a short period of time is one of the reasons: the staff of the Post Office participated in running the newspaper. From Comrade Su Younong of the Post Office to the staff of the Post Office in various districts and counties, they have all become distributors and promoters of the New Masses Daily. According to readers' reports, the postal workers of the Lin County Post Office brought chalk themselves and wrote blackboards everywhere while delivering newspapers, promoting the benefits of the New Masses Daily. Many postal workers also investigated materials and collected readers' opinions while delivering newspapers, and wrote to the newspaper. According to our current statistics of submissions, the number of people writing articles each month is at most 2,000 people. Compared to our 50,000 readers, the number is very small. If all our readers can tell us the situation of policy implementation in various places in a timely manner after a Party policy is issued, and are as closely related to the newspaper as postal workers, we think that the New Masses Daily can truly be called a mass newspaper. Now our editing and liaison work is being done in this direction.

### 新大众报四个月

    新大众报四个月
    新大众报已经出版了四个月。这四个月里，到底有那些经验？这问题还很难回答。不错，从各个版来讲，在工作里也摸着一点方法，比如：时事消息，起初，大半是照人民日报的新闻，一条条来改写。后来觉着不行，一般区村干部同志，虽不能把人民日报的新闻，完全懂下，大意是知道的，我们再改写一遍，等于是把他已经知道的再告诉他，没有多少意思。才逐渐变换写法，有计划的来介绍战况、国内国外大事，写得比较有头有尾，使新闻系统化。有时，还把一般时事常识同新闻结合着来写。这种写法，现在看来，对我们的读者是比较合适的。他们缺乏的，正是各种常识，由于一个名词、一个地名不了解，往往不能把一条新闻全懂下。又比如：第三版里，把读者寄来的零碎材料，编辑成为意见、信箱、自修室等栏，随着稿子内容的不同，增加各种各样的专栏，使版面多样化；同时，扩大读者的写作范围。但这些方法，是不是就能介绍出来当作经验，我们还捉摸不定。我想了一想，如果真要说经验的话，恐怕得从工作做坏了的地方去找，下面便从头来叙一叙。
  一、把党的政策传达给群众
    新大众报第一张，就是宣传土地法大纲，和中央局土地会议后的各种文件。接着是宣传毛主席“目前形势与我们的任务”的报告，中央与中央局填补、整党、民主的指示。如今是宣传毛主席在晋绥的讲话，和中央局纠正左倾错误的指示。四个月来，向群众宣传党的政策，成了新大众报的主要内容，一切新闻、文章、问答、信箱、快板等等，都是围绕着这个主要内容来写的。这个主要工作，现在检讨，有的地方做得很不好，原因是：编辑者过去阶级观点模糊，整党以后，又歪在另一面，带着左倾情绪，来学习党的政策，以致宣传土地会议文件时，把握不住精神，解释起来容易弄歪，如象改写的告党员书等。对各处情况、工作，又缺乏了解，只是盲目强调贫雇，更不能把党的政策同具体情况相结合了。工作没做好，从检讨里就给了我们这一条教训：新大众报因为以宣传解释党的政策为主，所以得着群众拥护，正因为它要把许多政策改写来使群众都懂得，如果不好好研究，用心掌握政策的精神，就容易出错。一个直接向群众说话的，目前销数将近五万份的报纸，解释政策上出了错，错误就大得很。从这一点上，使我们觉着：新大众的通俗化，不是别的，就是正确宣传党的政策，说出来不走样，使人人都懂得政策的精神，按照它来办事。下面的例子，可以做说明：
    根据太行新华日报的反映，太行涉县、沙河一些村里，因为去年三查时追三代、掂都芦，和去年冬天，没有工作团领导就成立贫农团，乱订成份，错斗中农，以致今年生产时，大家情绪都不高。中央局二月一日指示公布后，新大众报把这指示里的划阶级、团结中农问题，一个个提出来作了具体解释，“必须细致划阶级”，这篇文章，在这些村子里，起了相当的作用，这些村里的中农，原来认为成份就难干，划不准是个啥，总是不放心的；大家念了这篇文章，情绪就慢慢安定下来。同样，在冀南肥乡这些地方，我们的记者，给群众念了宣传土地法的文章，群众听完，就要求把这张报留下，他们说：“这就有了底，留下来，以后就好照这底办事”。念了划阶级的文章，群众听说是中央定下的，都要照着做。就说：“这可好了，过去来的工作员，一人一个尺子，咱也弄不清；如今都按毛主席给的尺子做，老百姓也懂得，就不会出错了”。诸如此类的例子，说明群众要求要掌握党的政策。原来指示的内容多，他们记不了，要求一个一个问题讲；指示里有些地方懂不下，要求具体解释。新大众是按照这样来做的，所以，不仅是销路增多了，三个月内，从不到一万份，增加到将近五万份；许多群众、区村干部，更把它当作“底”，按照报上说的去办事。
  二、把群众的问题收集上来
    新大众报是个群众报纸，既是一个群众报纸，就应该有广大群众同报纸声气相通，把他们的问题，随时反映出来。在这方面，我们也有过曲折。
    新大众报出版时，由于我们盲目的左倾情绪，认为过去新大众杂志的通讯员都不可靠，想一脚踢开“老组织”，去培养所谓贫雇骨干，后来，在通讯员里，作了一下调查，原来，过去的通讯员，绝大部分都是劳动农民出身，都是工农通讯员。在调查表里，通讯员们，详细叙述了他们的出身、成份，还详细叙述了他们工作或住的村子，几年来翻身的情况。从这些情况里，可以看出：在太行老区里，封建基本上消灭了，干部成份，一般讲都不错，就是多占果实，作风不民主。由于有这些调查，把我们最初认为各村都是漆黑一团的情绪，逐渐扭转过来。以后，中央局指示下来，也证实了这些调查是可靠的。我们因此想到：许多读者、通讯员，对报纸很热心，就是一时不会写稿。过去我们硬要他们写，出题目、发提纲，一时写不好，又把他们冷落下来。使这一大部分读者、通讯员，往往不能和报纸声气相通，各村的情况、群众中的问题，不能更多的到我们手里。通联工作上，对通讯员要给得多要得少，但少不是说没有。如何使读者、通讯员都能供给情况，一个政策下来以后，向读者做一些调查，首先向通讯员做一些调查，就有必要了。
    除开新闻稿子与向读者作调查，我们现在了解情况的最大一个来源，就是“有问必答”。四月份，我们每天平均收到八十封信，这里面有三分之一，甚至二分之一是问题。这些问题，内容很丰富，往往能提出一些新的情况，使我们及时注意各地的疾苦。另外，党的一个指示下来，区村干部在执行时有什么困难，群众中还有什么疑惑，从读者提的问题里，也可以有更多的了解。甚至一个时候，那一件事情在群众中造成不安，我们收到的问题便以这一类为最多。由于报纸篇幅有限，许多问题没法刊出。现在，我们正尽量用信来答复，以便所有读者，都能把他们的疑难告诉给报纸。我们觉得：只有更多的了解情况，才能更好的来执行党的政策。广大的读者，正是我们了解情况的源泉。如何使他们随时把群众中的疾苦，群众中的问题，写出来寄给我们。除了新闻稿，我们还只做了上面所说的这两点。
  三、大家看、大家办
    总起来说：四个月的工作里，我们只摸着了这一条：了解情况，根据群众要求去传达解释政策。这一步，如今也还没有做好，至于第二步，把新的群众意见集中起来，坚持贯彻政策，就更差的远了。要把这两步工作做好，今后，除了多请示中央局宣传部，加强研究，以免在政策上出错；还要用力来解决问题，就是“大家看，大家办”了。过去，我们只是想做好通联工作，使读者都来写稿，这一点是重要的，但还不能说就做够了。这次新大众报出版，短时期内能发行这样多，原因之一，就是邮政局的职工，参加来办了报。从邮政总局苏幼侬同志起，到各区各县的邮局职工们，都做了新大众的发行者和宣传者。据读者反映，林县邮局的邮工同志，自己带着粉笔，一面送报，一面到处写黑板，宣传新大众的好处。不少邮工，送报时还调查材料，收集读者意见，写给报纸。按照我们今天来稿统计，每月写稿的人数，最多不过两千人，拿我们五万读者作比例，数目是很少的。如果，我们所有的读者，在党的一个政策下去了以后，就能把各地执行政策的情况，及时告诉我们，象邮工同志一样，和报纸息息相关，我们想：新大众报，才真正称得起群众报。如今我们的编辑、通联工作，就正向这方面来做。
