Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [JinChaJi] 8th Telegram: The North Yue District Forest and Pasture Conference in mid-last month decided to focus on five counties, Wutai, Hunyuan, Fanshi, Lingqiu, and Fuping, to vigorously promote afforestation, forest protection, and animal husbandry. According to the Outline Land Law, the large forests of temples, puppet regimes, warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords in the five counties were designated as state-owned forests. Other forests were appropriately designated as village-owned or private forests according to their original ownership, size, and nature. The masses were mobilized to close the mountains for forest protection and to prohibit the arbitrary felling of fruit trees. In the Fanshi area, existing windbreak forest cooperatives will be promoted as much as possible, and a large number of fruit seedlings and tree saplings will be cultivated. Wutai will use the method of work-for-relief to mobilize the masses to plant trees. The conference also decided to establish seven stud stations to encourage the masses to raise more cows, ewes, and mares. These seven stations plan to breed 1,000 head of livestock this year as a typical demonstration. Veterinary stations have been established in Fanshi and other places to help the masses treat livestock. The Wutai Mountain Ranch Management Committee was established in Wutai to resolve years of disputes among the various ranches. The county is also actively preparing for the June Mule and Horse Fair to promote livestock trade. In addition, hunters from various places will be organized to launch hunting campaigns.
