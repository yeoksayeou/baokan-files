　　North Korean Economic Construction Leaps Forward
  　Unemployed Workers Completely Eliminated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] Pyongyang Dispatch: Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the North Korean People's Committee, at the Joint Conference of Representatives of Democratic Parties and Groups in North and South Korea in late April, spoke glowingly about the economic construction and national cultural development in North Korea over the past two years and more, saying: The most important achievement of the People's Committee is the implementation of various democratic reforms in North Korea. The important successes achieved in 1945 and 1946 demonstrated the People's Committee's ability to handle complex economic, political, and cultural issues, thus completely refuting the slander by American reactionaries that the Korean people cannot govern themselves. Kim Il-sung pointed out: As a result of land reform, more than one million acres of cultivated land have been distributed to farmers, providing conditions for rapidly improving farmers' welfare. In the southern part of Pyongyang alone, farmers have built 10,000 new houses and repaired 70,000 houses. The nationalization of industry, banks, transportation, and communications has destroyed the economic position of reactionaries and pro-Japanese elements, and has enabled North Korea's economic life to achieve unprecedented progress. Industrial production in 1947 increased by 2.2 times compared with 1946. In 1947, there were more than 70 kinds of industrial products that previously had to be imported from Japan but are now being manufactured domestically. North Korea has implemented an eight-hour working day for industrial workers and a seven-hour working day for office staff. Systems such as paid holidays, social insurance, and labor safety laws have been established. Unemployed workers have completely disappeared in North Korea. Kim continued: The number of schools has increased by 2.3 times, and the number of higher education institutions has increased 14 times. Several higher education institutions have already been opened. In 1947, children of workers and peasants accounted for 75 percent of the total number of students in North Korea. More than 800,000 adults are studying. In two years, the number of hospitals established by the government has increased by 7.7 times; the number of clinics has increased by 14 times. Kim Il-sung, comparing the situation in South Korea, said: South Korea has not yet implemented democratic reforms, and the material life of the people there is deteriorating day by day.
