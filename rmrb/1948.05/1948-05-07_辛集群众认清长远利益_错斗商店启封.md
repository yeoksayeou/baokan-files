　　Xinji Masses Recognize Long-Term Interests; Wrongfully Confiscated Shops Reopened
　　[Our News] Xinji Town in the Yongzhi Second District is the largest market town in the county. Of the 720 households in the town, very few own land; 80% rely on doing business to maintain all or part of their livelihoods. During the land review last July, the businesses of landlords and rich peasants were all sealed up. Larger businesses feared being targeted, and many, such as Li Yudai's ironware store and other shops, were only selling goods and not buying them, just trying to get by. When the Land Law came, the masses were puzzled to see the protection of industry and commerce. They wondered, "In the past, we weren't afraid of being ruthless in the struggle against landlords, so why are we giving back to them now?" Some honest poor and hired peasants, like Li Ruizhen and Li Shutang, came to the district cadres and said, "The landlords' businesses cannot be given back to them! If they are given back, they will be much stronger than us! Then they will be in heaven! The poor are waiting to be given a pot to use! These businesses are worth money! Let the poor run them!" Others said, "The higher-ups are being too lenient with the landlords!" Some said to the district cadres, "You went to the district committee meeting for two months, and we were hoping you would come back and we would get some of the fruits [of the revolution], but who knew it would be to give things to the landlords?" To resolve the masses' concerns, the district cadres went deep into the groups to explain individually. First, they got the village cadres to understand and asked them to publicize [the policy]. After five days, they had individual talks with 40 to 50 households, using practical examples to educate the peasants to focus on long-term interests, explaining what our village's market was like during last year's struggle and what it is like now. This helped them to understand things a bit. Li Shutang and Li Changping said, "If we don't touch industry and commerce, we'll see more money at each market; if the market isn't good, we'll see less money. A good market depends entirely on businesses!" A mass meeting was held on the 9th to explain the policy on industry and commerce. At this time, most people realized that protecting industry and commerce was for the benefit of us peasants, and middle merchants and middle peasants expressed their support for protecting industry and commerce. Li Shijun, who does small business, said, "The leadership of the higher-ups is really wise. From now on, those who do business will be more daring, and the market will become bigger and bigger." After discussion among the masses, it was decided to return the businesses to their original owners. Wanxing Ironware Store, Wencheng Grocery Store, and a preserved vegetable shop have all opened their doors. Li Yudai's ironware store is planning to do big business.

　　辛集群众认清长远利益
  　错斗商店启封
    【本报消息】永智二区辛集镇是全县顶大的集市，全镇七百廿户，土地很少，十分之八靠做生意维持一部或全部生活。去年七月复查，把地主富农的工商业都封了门，比较大点的买卖，都怕斗到自己身上不敢干了，如李玉岱的铁货店和其他一些店铺不少都是光卖货不买货，应付门市。土地法来到，群众见到保护工商业很纳闷，认为过去对地主斗争时不怕狠，怎么这又给他呢？区干到村有不少的老实贫雇象李瑞贞、李书堂找来说：“地主的买卖不能给他呀！要给他又比咱强的多啦！那他可上了天啦！穷人都等着分口锅用呢！这几处买卖值银子啦！叫穷人干吧！”还有的说：“上级对地主可怜啦！”有的说区干：“你们去地委开会两个月，我们盼你们回来俺分点果实，谁知道是给地主东西呢？”区干为了解决群众的思想，就深入小组，个别解释，先打通村干思想，叫他们去宣传，经过五天，有四五十户个别谈话，以实际例子教育农民从长远利益着眼，说明去年斗争时咱村的集成了怎样？现在又怎样？这一来思想上有点通了，李书堂、李长平说：“不动工商业咱每集多见钱，集要成不好就少见钱，好集全靠买卖呢！”在九号召开了群众大会，讲明工商业政策，这时多数人认识到保护工商业是为的咱农民利益，中等商人和中农更表示对保护工商业拥护。做小买卖的李士俊说：“上级的领导真明白，以后做买卖的就大胆了，集得越成越大。”经过群众讨论，确定退还原主，万兴铁货铺、文成杂货行、和一处酱菜铺，都开了门，李玉岱的铁货铺正想法大干。
