　　Gou Di Solves Food Difficulties for Wrongly Struggled Households; Corrects Wage Determination Method Based on Class
    [Changzhi News] Gou Di in the Fifth District of Changzhi held a cadre meeting on the 22nd of this month to review spring plowing work. After the cadres reported, the following problems were hindering spring sowing: First, when collecting burdens last year, the village had already calculated the burden points according to the agricultural income tax collection method. Subsequently, there was a change, unilaterally favoring the poor and hired peasants, and arbitrarily increasing the burden on middle peasants and above, forming a phenomenon of struggling against middle peasants. The most serious case was that of middle peasants Li Wangchun and Li Heize, whose eleven family members had to provide 1,300 jin of coarse grains. This solution was only achieved after persuasion from district cadres. Individual poor peasants, such as Li Zhagen and Li Laishun, wanted to increase the burden on these two households to the point where they could not afford it, and would have to sell their plows and land. The whole village increased the burden on middle peasants by 41 shi. Second, last autumn, a poor peasant named Li Bengze had eight bags of grain and twenty bags of corn confiscated because cadres mobilized his son to join the army but he didn't go. Because of the cadres' reckless behavior, the peasants' property was not adequately protected, resulting in adverse consequences for this year's spring plowing production, and the masses were not motivated to produce. After learning about this situation, the district cadres held a mass meeting of more than a hundred people that night, explaining the policy of uniting with middle peasants. The village cadres also reviewed the above-mentioned wrongdoings. After discussion by the masses, it was decided to first return four shi of grain to the two middle peasant households who had no food to eat. All the grain confiscated from the poor peasant Li Bengze was returned. Nine shi of grain were borrowed for the four poor peasant households who had no food to eat. It was also decided that landlords and rich peasants who had no food to eat would be paid wages immediately after doing work for someone (Editor's note: Landlords and rich peasants who have no food to eat should also be given food to allow them to produce.) The village's wages were also uniformly set at two and a half sheng, abolishing the previous method of dividing wages by class (previously, landlords and rich peasants received half a sheng, and peasants received one sheng each, excluding meals). The difficulties of the whole village, such as having no food to eat and no land to cultivate, have been initially resolved. As the poor peasant Li Bengze said, "If this grain had not been returned to me, I would not have been able to cultivate my land." The middle peasant Li Guobao said, "If things had continued as before, who would dare to produce? This is much better now." After discussion and precise calculation, a spring plowing and sowing plan was formulated. All 763 mu of land in the village can be sown by April 15th.

　　沟底解决错斗户粮食困难
  　纠正按阶层订工资办法
    【长治消息】长治五区沟底于本月二十二日召开干部会议，检查春耕工作。经过干部汇报，有如下问题阻碍着春耕下种：一、在去年征收负担时，该村已照农业所得税征收办法，算就负担分数，随后又来了个变化，片面的照顾贫雇，随便对中农以上户加重负担，形成斗争中农现象。最严重的如中农李旺春、李黑则两户十一口人，即出一千三百斤粗粮。这还是在区干部说服下才得到这样的解决。个别贫农如李扎根、李来顺，他们是想把这两户的负担加到出不起时，把耧、地卖了。全村给中农加重负担四十一石。二、去秋参军有一贫农李崩则，因干部动员他儿子参军没去，把他已收的八袋谷、廿袋玉茭全部没收。由于干部胡做乱为，农民财产得不到应有的保障，造成今年在春耕生产中的恶果，群众生产不起劲。区干部了解到这种情况，当夜召开百余人群众大会，说明团结中农政策，村干又把上述错误行为作了检讨，经过群众讨论，把当下没吃的两户中农先退回四石粮。没收贫农李崩则的粮食全部退还，当下没吃的贫农四户，共借粮九石。还有四户地主富农没吃的，决定给谁做了活随即交工资（编者按：对没粮食吃的地主富农应同样给他们粮食让他们生产。）把全村工资也统一规定为二升半，取消以前工资分阶层的办法（以前地富是半升、农民一升均除吃）。全村没吃没地种等困难，得到初步解决，如贫农李崩则说：“要不给我退回这粮食，我的地就种不上。”中农李国宝说：“照以前那样办，谁还敢生产？这回就好啦。”经过讨论，精确计算，定出春耕下种计划。全村土地七六三亩，四月十五可全部下种。
