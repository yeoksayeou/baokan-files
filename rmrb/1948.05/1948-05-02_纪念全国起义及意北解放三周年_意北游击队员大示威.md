Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Milan dispatch: On the 25th, 15,000 former guerrilla fighters gathered in the historically significant Piazza del Castello here to commemorate the third anniversary of the national uprising and the liberation of Northern Italy. Longo, leader of the All-Italy Guerrilla Association, delivered a speech at the meeting. Afterwards, they marched to Loreto Square (note: the place where Mussolini was hung upside down after his execution in 1945), three miles away, to hold a celebratory demonstration. However, the road to the square was blocked by fully armed police. Longo angrily shouted, "The police want to stop us, but we must go no matter what!" Responding to his call, the guerrillas' magnificent ranks immediately surged towards the blockade line like a tide. The police fired machine guns into the air above the crowd. The crowd, filled with indignation, swarmed forward and engaged in a club fight with the police, bravely breaking through the first blockade line at Piazza Cadorna and detouring to successfully reach their destination. Invignitz, the leader of the Italian Communist Party's Milan trade union, delivered a speech there, loudly protesting "the police's provocation of citizens celebrating the anniversary of the liberation." He warned, "The People's Democratic Front will launch an even stronger counterattack on May Day, and no one can stop us."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Rome dispatch: The National Committee of the Italian Guerrilla Association issued a letter to the Italian people on the 25th, the third anniversary of the National Uprising and the Liberation of Northern Italy. The letter, after recounting "the victory of the democratic forces over Nazism and Fascism," called on the people to "vigilantly defend the democratic system, and oppose those forces that want to destroy the tradition of the Resistance movement, with which the future of Italy is inextricably linked."
