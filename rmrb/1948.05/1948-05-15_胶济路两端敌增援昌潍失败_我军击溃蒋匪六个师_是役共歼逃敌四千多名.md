Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 13th: The People's Liberation Army defeated six divisions and eleven brigades, as well as two security regiments of Chiang bandits, who launched attacks from both the east and west ends of the Jiaoji Railway, completely shattering the enemy's dream of reinforcing Chang, Wei, and An, and consolidating the great victory in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway. Since the People's Liberation Army launched a powerful offensive to encircle and annihilate the Chiang bandits in Chang, Wei, and An, the Chiang bandits hurriedly pieced together forces at both ends of the Jiaoji Line, advancing towards each other from east and west. On the western front, Bandit Wang Yaowu personally led six brigades from the 73rd, 75th, and 84th Reorganized Divisions, departing from Jinan on April 16th to reinforce eastward. They were repeatedly ambushed by our army along the way, leaving the bandits exhausted. On average, they crawled less than 20 li per day. By the 25th, the bandits were surrounded by our forces on both banks of the Zi River, west of Yidu and south of Linzi, unable to move. On the 26th and 27th, just as our army was finally annihilating the Chiang bandits in Weicheng, Bandit Wang Yaowu anxiously gazed eastward at Weicheng, 120 li away. He then concentrated five brigades, launching continuous fierce attacks on the cities of Linzi and Yidu under heavy artillery fire and air cover. Our army calmly fought back, and the two cities stood firm, preventing the bandits from crossing the Lei Chi one step. By May 1st, Chang, Wei, and An were completely liberated by our forces. Bandit Wang, fearing a new attack from our forces, hurriedly turned around and fled westward on the 2nd. Our army immediately pursued, and as of the 8th, we have successively recovered Zhangdian and Zhoucun, and are still continuing the fierce pursuit. On the eastern front, Bandit Ding Zhi Pan also gathered five brigades from the 64th, 54th, and 2nd Reorganized Divisions, as well as two security regiments. Since April 5th, he had been advancing westward with trepidation. As soon as he reached the Gu River area east of Jiaoxian, he was met with a head-on blow from our forces, and the bandits dared not advance rashly. By the 8th of this month, Bandit Ding, seeing that the overall situation was hopeless, also turned tail and fled eastward. Our army is now crossing the Gu River in hot pursuit. In total, 4,763 enemy troops were killed or captured in the entire campaign, two enemy planes were shot down, three cannons, 44 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 380 long and short guns were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: On the 2nd, local armed forces and militia in Binhai intercepted remnants of the enemy fleeing south from Anqiu in the Daguanzhuang and Tingshui areas southwest of Juxian County. After ten hours of fierce fighting, they repelled eight enemy counterattacks and completely defeated the enemy. In this battle, 1,047 bandits, including Wang Pizhou, the Major Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion of the Anqiu Self-Defense Force, were captured alive. In addition, 503 bandits, including Wang Baoguang, the Second Battalion Commander of the Anqiu Joint Defense, were killed or wounded. One 60mm mortar, ten light machine guns, five Thompson submachine guns, and 472 long and short guns, as well as a portion of ammunition, Chiang currency, and military supplies were seized.
