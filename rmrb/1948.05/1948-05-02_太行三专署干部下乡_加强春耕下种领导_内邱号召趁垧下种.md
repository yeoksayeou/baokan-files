　　[Taihang Third Administrative Region News] In order to rapidly and effectively ensure that all arable land is sown, the Taihang Third Administrative Region has dispatched six cadres and eighty-six teachers and students from the cadre training school to form a spring plowing work team. Starting from April 19th, they have been going to various counties. Under the unified leadership of the county, they are going deep into the villages to fully organize the masses to carry out spring plowing and sowing.

　　[Further News] As spring plowing and sowing are approaching with the season, the Taihang Third Administrative Region specifically instructed all counties on April 21st to quickly organize the masses and fully carry out spring plowing and sowing. First, it is required that all localities overcome the ideological obstacles of village cadres not leading, the masses waiting for filling and misunderstanding filling as disrupting equal distribution; and overcome the spontaneous flow and stagnation of spring plowing. Secondly, due to the general lack of labor and livestock in various places and the heavy war service tasks, it is pointed out that the organizational experience of the past should be accepted, and the power of organization should be brought into play. Rectify mutual aid, clear up all the problems left over from mutual aid groups and large-scale labor exchange, universally and informally organize, adhere to the principles of democracy, voluntariness, and equal value, and never have the bad style of forced voluntariness again. Regarding solving the labor shortage, it is pointed out that women and children should be vigorously mobilized and organized to participate in labor. If necessary, sideline production such as weaving can be temporarily suspended. In areas with spring famine, sideline production should be organized as much as possible, exchanging millet to tide over the spring famine, without hindering the principle of spring plowing and sowing. Regarding the leadership of spring plowing and sowing, the head of the County Government Construction Section and the president of the County-District Cooperative should be fully drawn out to participate. Cadres who are democratically filling key positions should also be drawn out to participate immediately. The county and district should be equipped with capable cadres to specialize in leadership; and all the cadres that the county can draw out should be drawn out to form a spring plowing work team to go deep into the villages to organize the masses to sow.

　　[Neiqiu News] The Neiqiu Joint Office issued a circular calling for learning from Nanjie's seizing the opportunity to sow every "shang." After the thorough rain on the 29th day of the second lunar month, the masses in Nanjie, within the city, generally held the idea that it was not too late to sow and that the "shang" should be sown slowly. They resisted the county and district's call to seize the opportunity to sow early, fearing that if they sowed early, others would not sow and the early ripening would be ruined. They also felt that if they sowed early, the crops would not grow stalks. The village production committee and cadres, through patient explanation and discussion, cleared the masses' thinking and sowed a large amount. By the fifteenth day of the third month, they had sown 282 mu of sorghum, 95 mu of cotton, 186 mu of millet, and 20 mu of sesame, totaling more than 530 mu, with 53.5 mu not sown (which could be fully sown in two more days). It is said that Kanmazhuang completed it even earlier. In addition, there are a few other villages that have also sown. However, there are still many villages where the village cadres and production committee members have not done this, and very little or even no sowing has been done to date. For example, in Zhongcheng Village in the Second District, the village cadres and production committee acted as the tail of the masses (of course, not just this village, there are others). Not only did they not do a good job in clearing the masses' thinking, but the village chief also believed that after the land was harrowed, it was no longer possible to do it if it was two fingers thick, relaxed the promotion of sowing, and did not attach importance to the fact that this year is a year of famine, and early sowing means early harvest. This year, there is a lot of wheat, and spring land is actively being rushed, so that wheat stubble will not be barren.

　　太行三专署干部下乡
  　加强春耕下种领导
  　内邱号召趁垧下种
    【太行三专署消息】为迅速有效的保证耕地全部下种，太行三专署已抽出干部六人及干中师生八十六人，合组春耕工作队，于四月十九日起身，分赴各县。在县的统一领导下深入各村，以全力组织群众，进行春耕下种。
    【又息】春耕下种随节令的迫近，太行三专特于四月二十一日指示各县，迅速组织群众，全力进行春耕下种。首先是要求各地克服村干部躺下不领导，群众等待填补与对填补误解为打乱平分的思想障碍；克服春耕的自流与停顿状态。其次，由于各地劳畜力普遍缺乏，战勤任务繁重，指出应该接受过去的组织经验，发扬组织起来的力量。整顿互助，清理互助组、大变工中一切遗留问题，普遍地不拘形式地组织起来，坚持民主自愿与等价原则，绝不能再有强迫自愿的恶劣作风。关于解决劳力困难，指出应大力发动与组织妇女儿童参加劳动。必要时，可暂时停止一下纺织等副业生产。有春荒的地区，在不妨碍春耕下种原则下，尽可能组织副业生产，换小米，渡春荒。关于春耕下种的领导，县府建设科长、县区联社的社长要全抽出来参加。民主填补基点的干部也马上抽出参加，县区要配备得力干部专门领导；并将全县可能抽出的干部，全部抽出，组成春耕工作组，深入各村组织群众下种。
    【内邱消息】内邱联合办公室发出通报号召学习南街趁垧下种。阴历二月二十九日下透雨后，城内南街群众普遍存着下种不晚，垧好慢慢种思想，对县区号召趁垧早下种抵抗，怕自己种的早了，别人都不种熟的早要糟塌。又觉着种的早了庄稼不起秸。这村生产委员会及干部，用耐心解释和讨论的方式打通了群众思想，大量下种。干到三月十五日已种上高粱二百八十二亩，棉花九十五亩，谷子一百八十六亩，芝麻二十亩，共五百三十多亩，没种上的五十三亩五（再有两日能全部下种）。据说看马庄完成的还早。另外还有少数村也都下了种。但是还有不少村庄，村干及生产委员没有这样作，至今下种很少，甚至没下。例如二区中呈村，村干部和生产委员会当了群众尾巴（当然不是光这个村，其他还有），不但没有很好去打通群众思想，并且村长还认为地打耙好后，干二指厚再不往下干了，放松了推动下种，没有重视今年是荒年，早种早接嘴，今年麦子多，春地活往前赶，麦茬才不荒的道理。
