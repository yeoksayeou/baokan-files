    [Taiyue News] County Head Hou of Hongdong personally corrected the "leftist" errors of infringing upon industry and commerce, and the market in the town began to be active. Last winter in Hongdong, 17 large and small businesses were randomly struggled against and their property confiscated, worth approximately 36.39 million yuan, causing everyone to be afraid to do business. Liu Baosheng buried goods worth 60 shi of wheat underground. Wu Changfu, the manager of Xingyong Freight, sold off or hid the goods, and even he himself ran away, leaving only a few shop assistants to watch the door. There were a total of 30 businesses in similar situations, and more than 120 doing large-scale business set up small stalls. On May 7th, County Head Hou personally went to the town to convene a meeting of district cadres and merchants. After explaining our party's policy on industry and commerce in detail, he also stated that the mistake of struggling against industry and commerce last winter must be resolutely corrected today. Therefore, the merchants' morale was high, and some said, "Now we are not afraid." The next day, County Head Hou personally led the return of Wu Changfu's three market houses and property. Other district cadres also went down to solve problems separately. The merchants' concerns began to be dispelled. Kerosene, foreign cloth, and other goods buried underground were taken out, and businesses that had closed their doors reopened. As of May 20th, more than 20 new businesses had been added to Guyi Street alone.

　　洪洞侯县长亲自领导退还工商业
    【太岳消息】洪洞侯县长亲自纠正侵犯工商业的左倾错误，城关市场开始活跃。洪洞城关去年冬天乱斗乱没收大小商号十七家，约值三千六百三十九万余元，闹得大家不敢营业。刘保盛把价值六十石麦子的货物埋在地下，兴永货栈的掌柜吴常富把货物卖的卖了，藏的藏了，本人也跑了，只留下几个伙计看门。象他们这样情况的共有三十家，还有一百二十多家做大买卖的，都摆成了小摊。五月七日侯县长亲到城内召开区干部和商民会议，把我党的工商业政策详细讲解以后，还说明去冬斗争工商业的错误今天要坚决纠正。因此商民情绪高涨，有的说：“这就不怕啦。”第二天侯县长亲自领导把吴常富的三间市房及财产一齐退还了，其他区干部也分别下去解决问题，商人顾虑开始解除了，埋在地下的洋油、洋布等都取出来，搭了门的商号也开门营业，到五月二十日为止，仅估衣街就增加商号二十多家
