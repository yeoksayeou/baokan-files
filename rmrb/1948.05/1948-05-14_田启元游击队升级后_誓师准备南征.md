Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th: The Yanfu Sub-district Tian Qiyuan Guerrilla Unit, famous for its heroic fighting in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has recently been honorably upgraded to a local military corps. The unit held a general mobilization rally for all soldiers on the 2nd, resolving to write to Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, Chairman Lin of the Border Government, and Commanders He and Wang of the Joint Defense Military Region, requesting an early expedition. The letter stated: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and yourselves, we have persisted in fighting in the suburbs of Yan'an, the sacred site of democracy, for thirteen months. Today, Yan'an has been liberated, and we have been honorably approved to be reorganized into a regular army. We have grown up in the happy life of abundant food and clothing in the border region for more than ten years, but the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandits have destroyed our beautiful scene. Our fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters are eating chaff and swallowing vegetables. Although Yan'an has been recovered, we must continue to take revenge. We ask you to quickly issue an order to let us set off in advance, fight to Xi'an, and capture Hu Zongnan alive. We are ready for everything. We swear that under your leadership, we will not be afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, fight to the final victory, and not return home until the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandits are crushed."

In other news: The Tian Detachment has proposed a competition to the Shanxiang Detachment with the following conditions: continue to consolidate the troops and ensure that all will participate in the expedition; resolutely implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and protect the interests of the masses; and use the gaps during marching to strengthen military learning and improve skills.
