    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: News from Taiwan: The US and Japan are strengthening their aggression against Taiwan's fishing industry. The Fisheries Rehabilitation Material Management Office of the Executive Yuan of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, transformed from the Fishing Management Office of the Executive Yuan controlled by US imperialism, has recently established a branch in Keelung, using it as the fishing center of Taiwan. It has also established a factory in Kaohsiung as the fish processing industrial center of Taiwan, in order to completely monopolize Taiwan's fishing industry. The US and Chiang are preparing to use most of the UNRRA's large amount of fishing machinery in China in Taiwan. US fishery experts such as Kaden are directly in charge of this aggression, and most of the fishing boat drivers are also Americans.
    
    Another dispatch: The aggression of Japanese fishing boats, instigated by US imperialism, against Taiwan's fishing industry is becoming increasingly serious. On the 17th of last month, four hidden large Japanese fishing boats were fishing in the sea north of Keelung. Before the end of the same month, several fishing boats such as the Tenmaru belonging to the Japan Fisheries Co., Ltd. were fishing in the eastern sea of Taiwan. At the beginning of this month, the First Tokusei and Third Tokusei, two Japanese fishing boats, were also fishing in the waters off Taiwan. The official Taiwanese Chiang bandit authorities also admitted: "This matter is commonplace. Japanese fishing boats can be seen every day on the coast of Taiwan and in any other fishing market, and sometimes there are more than a dozen."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Various sources report: The Kuomintang bandit gang has recently been issuing large amounts of banknotes in Taiwan and the Northeast to extract the blood and sweat of the people. The Taiwan Bank of the bandit gang has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance of the Kuomintang to issue 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan (equivalent to 167,000 yuan and 334,000 yuan of the Chiang bandit's "legal tender") large denomination Taiwan dollars starting from the 17th of this month. According to the bandit Central News Agency, the bank's past issuance has exceeded 25 billion yuan (equivalent to 835 billion yuan of "legal tender"), and the amount of this additional issuance is extremely large. Another message: In March, the Chiang bandits issued 100,000, 500,000, and 1 million (equivalent to 1 million, 5 million, and 10 million of "legal tender") denominations of circulating coupons in the Northeast, totaling 5 billion (equivalent to 5 trillion of pseudo-"legal tender"). Before this, the issuance of pseudo-Northeast circulating coupons had exceeded 1 trillion yuan (equivalent to 10 trillion of pseudo-"legal tender"). As a result of the rampant pseudo-circulating coupons: from March 1st to April 3rd, the price of sorghum rice per catty in Shenyang rose from 34,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan of pseudo-"legal tender," a sharp increase of more than two and a half times in one month.

　　美日加紧侵略台湾全面垄断台湾渔业
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】台湾消息：美日正加强对台湾渔业之侵略。由美帝控制下之行总渔管处化形而成之蒋匪行政院渔业善后物资管理处，近已在基隆设立分处，以该地作为台湾捕鱼中心。并又在高雄设立工厂，作为台湾鱼类加工工业中心，以便全面垄断台湾渔业。美蒋准备将联总在华大量渔业机械大部用于台湾，美帝渔业专家卡登等直接主持此项侵略事业，渔船驾驶人员亦多为美国人。
    另讯：由美帝纵使之日本渔船，对台湾渔业的侵略活动亦日趋严重。上月十七日，曾有隐蔽的日本大型渔船四艘，在基隆以北海面捕鱼。同月下旬前，日本水产株式会社所属之天丸轮等数艘渔船，在台湾东海面捕鱼。本月初，又有第一德生、第三德生两日本渔船在台湾海面捕鱼。台湾蒋匪官方亦承认：“此事已司空见惯，在台湾海岸及其他任何渔市场所在，每日均可遇见日本渔船，且有时多至十余艘。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：国民党匪帮近又在台湾及东北滥发大额钞票，榨取人民血汗，匪台湾银行已奉国民党财政部之命于本月十七日起发行五百元及一千元（等于蒋匪“法币”十六万七千元及三十三万四千元）大票面台币。据匪中央社供认：该银行过去的发行额已逾二百五十亿（合“法币”八万三千五百亿）元，此次增发数额极巨。另息：三月间蒋匪曾在东北发行十万、五十万及一百万（合“法币”百万、五百万及一千万）三种票面的流通券，总数达五十亿（合伪“法币”五万亿）元之多，在此以前，伪东北流通券发行额已逾一万亿元（合伪“法币”十万亿元）。伪流通券泛滥的结果：三月一日至四月三日沈阳高粱米每斤价格自伪“法币”三万四千元涨达十二万元，一月内暴涨两倍半强。
