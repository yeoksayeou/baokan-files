　　How to Deal with Households Without Labor in Mutual Aid Organizations?

Editor:

　　I. Last year, Liang Xingwang, a middle peasant in Guanyao, Fifth District of Xiangyuan, said that his family lived well and that poor people had not been thoroughly liberated, so he took away eight mu of wheat land, including the wheat. Now it is said that the interests of middle peasants should not be infringed upon, and those who have been occupied should be resolutely compensated, but the wheat has been harvested and eaten by the poor and hired laborers (about four dan). Now, resolute compensation is required. The land has been returned, but the wheat is difficult to deal with. In our discussion, some said that the families who ate the wheat should take it out again, but they are all in difficulty. Some suggested that the whole village should be levied to take it out for them, wouldn't this infringe on the interests of the middle peasants and others in the whole village? There is no fruit of struggle in the village (to relieve the difficulties of spring plowing households). But some say there is fruit, and the masses in the whole village are also dissatisfied. This problem is difficult to solve. I hope you can provide a solution?

　　II. What to do with families without labor when organizing mutual aid? If they are organized, it is feared that the group will not be consolidated. If they are not organized, they will not be able to farm. What should be done? Please reply.

Comrade Chang Sheng:

　　I. Compensation for the losses of wrongly struggled middle peasants is certain, but when the original items have been distributed to the masses and consumed, there is no need to insist on returning the original items. In the case of Guanyao Village, Fifth District of Xiangyuan, mentioned in the letter, I don't know if a remedy has been carried out. If it has not been carried out, the difficulty of production can be solved first, and the rest can be discussed later. If a remedy has been carried out, a corresponding share can be compensated from the entire fruit.

　　II. The organization of mutual aid must be completely voluntary by the masses. If the masses are unwilling to absorb households without labor into the mutual aid group, they should not be forced to be assigned to avoid making the mutual aid group unconsolidated. However, the village's production organization should be responsible for solving the production difficulties of this household, educate the masses to promote the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, and help households without labor to carry out production through labor exchange or other means, but also pay attention to ensuring that the labor-providing households receive due remuneration. Don't unilaterally take care of one side at a loss, which will only make it more difficult to solve the difficulties of households without labor. This is a difficult problem to solve. If there are more appropriate methods, or experience in handling these problems in the actual production process, I hope to put forward research.

### 组织互助中无劳力户怎办？

专栏：编读往来

　　组织互助中无劳力户怎办？编辑同志：
    一、襄垣五区贯窑中农梁兴旺去年说他家生活好，有穷人未翻透身，就把人家八亩麦地连地带麦拿出来啦。现在说不让侵犯中农利益，侵占了的要一律坚决补偿，但人家的麦子贫雇都收割吃啦（约四石），现要坚决的补偿，地已给人家退啦，但麦子很难处理。我们讨论有的说让吃了麦子的那几家再拿出来，但他们都困难，有的意见全村摊派给人家拿出，这不又侵犯了全村中农及其他的利益吗？村上没斗争果实啦（救济了春耕困难户）。但有的说有果实，全村群众亦就不满，这问题很难解决。希望解答个处理解决办法？
    二、组织互助无劳力的人家怎办？组织进去又怕把组搞的不巩固，不组织进去，他又无法种地，这样该怎办？请答复一下。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者　昌盛昌盛同志：
    一、补偿错斗中农损失是肯定的，但在原物已经分给群众并且消耗了的时候，不必坚持吃啥吐啥，退还原物。来信所提襄垣五区贯窑村不知是否进行填补，若未进行填补则可先解决其生产困难，其别以后再说。若已进行填补，则可从整个果实中补偿给相当一份。
    二、组织互助必须完全由群众自愿结合，无劳力户假如群众不愿吸收进互助组就不应勉强编制分派进去，以免把互助组搞的不巩固。但对于这户的生产困难，村中的生产机构应负责解决，教育群众发扬友爱互助精神，以变工或其他方式帮助无劳力户进行生产，但也要注意到使出劳力户获得应有报酬，不要片面照顾使一面吃亏，结果反使无劳力户的困难更不易解决，这是一个不好解决的问题，有无更适当的办法，或在实际生产过程中处理这些问题的经验，望能提出研究。
