　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The speed and scale of spring sowing across the Soviet Union exceeds last year's levels. The total area sown with summer crops, as of the 10th of this month, already exceeds the same period last year by a huge four million hectares. Agricultural sowing areas have expanded to the far north of Karelia, Finland, Sakhalin, and northern Siberia. The climate is warm this year, and the soil is moist, promising another bumper harvest. In the extreme southern regions of the Transcaucasus in Turkmenistan, barley and winter wheat are about to be harvested. Socialist competition in the countryside is unfolding enthusiastically. Belarussian farmers, in a letter to Stalin, guaranteed to reach the production level stipulated for the final year of the Five-Year Plan this year. Farmers in other regions are also actively putting forward guarantees exceeding the plan. A People's Daily editorial pointed out: "Thanks to the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the assistance of the Soviet government, socialist agriculture is progressing by leaps and bounds. Just comparing the farmers' guarantees from last year with those of this year, one can imagine the prosperous tomorrow of our countryside. The farmers' letters to Comrade Stalin prove the Bolshevik Party's communist education of the Soviet countryside has achieved significant results. The Bolshevik Party has made farmers conscious socialist builders and active communist fighters. The labor of Soviet farmers and the labor of industrial workers are becoming increasingly similar. Now, farmers are not only tillers but also creative workers familiar with the latest achievements in agricultural science and bravely pioneering the way for unprecedented harvests."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Thousands of Soviet factories and workshops have completed their May production plans. Some industries have even reported completing their June plans. In the Soviet capital, which occupies a leading position in the socialist system, several hundred factories had already completed their May plans by the beginning of this month. The entire food industry of Ukraine completed six months' worth of plans in just over four months, and its production volume exceeded the same period last year by 29%. The Yaroslavl Oblast's artificial rubber factory also completed six months of its plan in the same short period. Other industries in the region have all completed their May plans. In addition, the entire food industry of Moldova, some mines in the Donetsk and Chelyabinsk Oblasts, many factories in the Kharkiv Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Azerbaijan, as well as more than 30 factories under the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Manufacturing, have also completed their May production plans. Among them, in some agricultural machinery factories in Donbass alone, there are already more than 1,000 Stakhanovite movement participants who have completed and exceeded the third year's production plan.

　　苏联生产飞跃发展
  　今春播种较去年增加四百万公顷数千工厂和作坊完成五月份计划
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国今春播种的速度与规模超过去年水平，而夏季作物播种的总面积，截至本月十日止，已超过去年同期达四百万公顷之巨，农业播种地区已扩及于极北的卡累利亚、芬兰、库页岛与西伯利亚北部，今年气候温暖，土地润湿，可望再度丰收，在土库兹外高加索极南地区，大麦与冬麦即将收割。农村中社会主义竞赛正热烈展开，白俄罗斯农民在给斯大林的信中保证：今年达到五年计划最后一年所规定的生产水平，其他各地农民亦踊跃提出超过计划的保证。真理报社论指出：“由于布尔什维克党的领导和苏维埃政府的协助，社会主义农业正在飞跃地进步，只要拿去年农民的保证和今年的保证比一比，就可以想象我们农村繁荣的明天，农民们给斯大林同志的信，证明布尔什维克党对苏维埃农村的共产主义。教育方面已有显著成效，布尔什维克党已使农民成为自觉的社会主义建设者，共产主义的积极战士。苏维埃农民的劳动与产业工人的劳动，是愈来愈加相似，现在农民不仅是耕夫，而且是熟悉农业科学最新成果，并勇敢的为空前的收获开拓道路的具有创造性的工人了。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：数千个苏联工厂与作坊已完成五月份生产计划。某些工业并传来完成六月份计划的消息，在社会主义制度中占有先锋地位的苏联首都，已有好几百工厂在本月初就完成了五月份计划。乌克兰的全部食品业四个多月就完成了六个月的计划，其生产量并超过去年同一时期的百分之廿九。雅罗斯拉夫州的人造橡皮厂，也在同样短的时间内，完成了六个月的计划，该州其他工业则已全部完成五月份计划。此外已完成五月生产计划的还有莫尔达维亚的全部食品工业，顿尼兹与车里雅宾斯克州的若干矿场，哈尔科夫州、斯维德洛夫斯克州与亚塞拜疆的许多工厂以及机器与仪器工业制造部的三十多个工厂，其中单斯尼兹有些农业机器厂就已有一千多个斯达哈诺夫运动者，完成并超过了第三年的生产计划。
