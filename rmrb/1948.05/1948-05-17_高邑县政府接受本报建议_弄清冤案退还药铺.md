　　Li Zhilan comes to this newspaper
    Requesting investigation of injustice
    On April 20th, Li Zhilan, a farmer from Niu@bao in the Tenth District of Wu'an, came to this newspaper, saying that his father, Li Fake, opened a pharmacy in Zhonghan Village, Gaoyi County. On August 27th of last year, he was falsely accused of being a special agent by the public security officer of Zhonghan Village, beaten to death, and the pharmacy was confiscated. After this newspaper sent a letter to the Gaoyi County Government, asking them to investigate and resolve the matter, the Gaoyi County Government immediately sent people to conduct a serious investigation, clarify the truth, and replied to this newspaper. Li Zhilan has now officially received a notice from the New Farmers' Association of Zhonghan Village to go and accept the pharmacy.

    On April 20th, Li Zhilan, a farmer from Niu@bao in the Tenth District of Wu'an, came to this newspaper requesting an investigation into an injustice, saying: "My father's name is Li Fake, and he opened a pharmacy in Zhonghan Village, Gaoyi County. Last year, during the first month of the lunar calendar, he came back to see my grandmother and talked to me about how people in Zhonghan Village were taking medicine without paying. We were spending our days on corvée labor and our nights on sentry duty, and there was no time for business. I told him to come back in July or August. If someone wanted to buy the entire pharmacy, he should sell it; if no one wanted to buy it entirely, he should preserve it there. In July or August, my father wrote back saying: the business has been partnered with the village, and after settling the accounts, he would hurry home (the year before, a district cadre wanted to partner with my father, but I didn't want to, so we didn't). Later, there was no news. I sent three or four letters, but there was no reply. On September 27th, my aunt's husband (who also worked in the cooperative there) brought back a note that said: 'Li Fake is dead.' I didn't believe it, so I wrote a letter to my father, which was eventually forwarded by the village office, but there was still no reply. I prepared travel expenses and went with Li Guoen, a neighbor from Niu@bao, on October 18th. We didn't dare go to Zhonghan Village and stayed at Cui Lianke's house in Nanyang, Gaoyi. Li Guoen repeatedly encouraged me to go, saying: 'Don't be afraid, they killed your father, they can't kill you again.' After I went, I found the village head, Wang Lianzhong. Before I could say anything, he said: 'Your father was on sentry duty when, somehow, a landmine exploded! He couldn't hear us when we called him! He was talking to a special agent! Later, we brought him back, beat him a few times, and tied him up at the Martial Arts Committee. We didn't intend to execute him, but somehow he died.' That night, militiaman Li Decheng told me: 'This is going to be a big deal. The higher-ups (referring to the Fan district cadre) are insistent, and the young people are aggressive.' The district cadre took me to see the district head, who said: 'Your father was talking to a special agent (landlord) while on sentry duty, and he pulled the landmine himself. I investigated three families, and they all said that there were landlord shares in your father's business!' I said at the time: 'I dare not say whether my father made a mistake while on sentry duty, but as for landlord shares in my business, that is definitely not true.' The district head didn't say anything. My business was started by my grandfather and father. My brothers and I lived in other people's businesses, and the wages we earned from labor were repeatedly added to it, not just for a year or two. In the first half of August last year, my father needed to get a travel permit, but the village cadres wouldn't issue it. Later, a travel permit was issued, but he was assigned to sentry duty, and he talked to a special agent and pulled the landmine. But the sentry duty was being performed on the roof. Doesn't this make me suspicious? My family went to Zhonghan Village in 1932 and had no relationship with the landlords, we only rented the landlord's house for the pharmacy. My mother came back last April, and we didn't get any fruit. Three or four people, more than ten years of hard work, exchanged for a business being confiscated, my father being executed, and then being labeled a special agent. Isn't my suffering great? Please comrades, take the trouble to investigate and clarify."

　　高邑县政府接受本报建议
    弄清冤案退还药铺
  　李芝兰来本报
    要求调查冤屈
    四月二十日，武安十区牛＠堡农民李芝兰来到本报，说是他父亲李发科在高邑中韩村开一药铺，去年八月二十七日被中韩村公安员诬为特务打死，并没收药铺。经本报给高邑县政府去信，请他们调查解决。高邑县府马上派人认真调查，弄清真象，并复函本报，现李芝兰已正式接到中韩村新农会通知，前往接受药铺。兹将事件经过及高邑来信，报导于后：
    　　　　　　　　——编者
    　
    四月廿日，武安十区牛＠堡农民李芝兰来本报要求调查冤屈，说：“我父亲叫李发科，在高邑县中韩村开药铺。去年正月回来看我祖母，和我谈起中韩村干吃药不给钱，咱白天支差，黑夜站岗，买卖不用干了。我叫他七、八月回来，药铺如果有人全部买，就卖掉；没人全部买，就保存在那里。七、八月父亲来信说：买卖已与村上合伙，办清就急速回家（前年区干愿与我父合伙，我不愿意没合），后来一直没信，我去三、四封信也不见回音。九月廿七日，我大姨父捎回老楚（也在那里合作社作事）一个纸条，上写：“李发科死了。”我不信，即给父亲去信，最后由村公所转我父亲一信，都没回音。我准备盘缠，十月十八日同牛＠堡邻家李国恩同去，不敢到中韩村，住在高邑南阳崔连科家。李国恩再三鼓励我去，说：“不怕，人家打死你父亲，不能再把你打死。”我去了以后，找到村长王连仲，我还没说，他就说：“你父亲站岗，不知怎的地雷响了，叫他他还听不见！他跟特务说话呢！后来把他弄回来，打了几下，在武委会拴着，也没想把他处死，怎么着他就死了。”晚上民兵李德成对我说：“说这要出事哩。上边（指范区干部）执着哩，年青人上的猛。”区干部领我去见区长，区长说：“你父亲站岗时和特务（地主）说话，自己把地雷拉着了。我调查了三家，都说你父亲生意股里有老财股哩！”我当时说：“我父亲站岗有没有错误我不敢说，至于我生意里有老财股，那坚决没有。”区长没吭。我的生意开始是我祖父和父亲经营，我与兄弟住人家生意，劳动换来的薪金，屡次加入在内，并非一年二年之功。去年八月前半月，父亲要开路条，村干部不给开，后开了路条，偏偏又派站岗，就和特务说话，还拉着了地雷。可是站岗是在房上站着，看这事叫我怀疑不？我家三十二年去中韩村，与地主没关系，只药铺赁的地主房子。我母亲去年四月回来，任何果实没得上，三四个人，十余年的苦劳，换了个生意叫没收啦，父亲处死啦，结果还戴了个特务帽子。看我这苦大不大？请同志们费心调查明确。”
