　　Hurry Up and Inspect, Eliminate Stubble Fields
　　To the Editor:
　　On April 23rd, while walking from Shangtaibei Village, Er District, Licheng, towards the city, we saw two good pieces of land, one about five mu and the other about two mu in size, both covered with last year's grain stubble and hemp stalks near the border of Zhongjie. According to the people of Zhongjie, the five-mu plot was land bought here by a landlord from Pingshun, who was placed under control after returning home last winter, and the land was abandoned. The two-mu plot belongs to someone in the city. We also saw a three-mu plot near the border of Zizhen, covered with corn stalks.
　　In our opinion, now is the sowing season, and this year is a year of offensive. These good lands should not be abandoned. The village cadres in the border areas should be responsible for investigating and quickly plowing and sowing. Otherwise, if we miss the season, our production will suffer a great loss.
　　This is based on what we have seen. We are afraid that there are similar situations in other places. We hope that production personnel and village cadres in various places will quickly inspect, eliminate stubble fields, and hurry up with sowing. (Shen Fude, Liu Senqin)

　　赶快检查  消灭茬地编辑同志：
    在四月二十三日，从黎城二区上台北村，往城内走，经过中街地交界，看见有五亩大、还有二亩大两块好地，都长着去年的谷茬和大麻秆。据中街人说：那块五亩是平顺一个地主在这里买的地，他去冬回家被管制起来，地就荒了。那块二亩的地，是城内种的。又见到子镇界，还有三亩大一块地，长的玉茭秆。
    我们意见，现在正是下种时期，今年又是进攻的年头，这些好地，不该荒了，交界的村干部，应该负责调查，赶快犁耙下种，否则过了节令，咱们的生产就有大损失。
    这是据我们见到的情况，恐怕各地也有这些情形，希各地推动生产人员与村干部，迅速检查，消灭茬地，赶快下种。（申福德、刘森芹）
