(Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th) Tian Qiyuan, captain of the Yan'an-An'sai guerrilla unit, was recently awarded the New Democracy Medal and commendation order by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. His unit has also recently been upgraded to a regular army. He and his unit are among the most famous guerrilla forces and commanders in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

Tian is still a young man, only twenty-six years old this year. Under his leadership, the guerrilla unit fights resolutely, bravely, and resourcefully, constantly striking and eliminating enemy troops. They have fought famous battles such as the Battle of the Shenling Mountain and the Yanhewan, with enemy-to-own casualties at a ratio of twenty-one to one, recovering vast areas and removing thirteen township offices. Once, on the Yan'gan Highway, the enemy dispatched a battalion to seize grain, with the enemy security police in front, regular troops in the rear, and livestock in the middle. Tian boldly used two detachments to suddenly intercept the enemy, quickly seizing four pack mules and capturing four men and guns. He called it the "heart-gouging battle." During the Hu bandit's large-scale sweep, they were active on the enemy's rear lines of communication. Once, Tian himself put on a captured Hu bandit uniform and sat by the roadside. Cars passed by one after another. In the last car, someone stood up and looked around with binoculars. Tian guessed that he was an enemy officer and threw a grenade at him. This time, he captured many important documents from Luo Lie, the division commander of the enemy's First Division.

Like other guerrilla units, the Tian Qiyuan guerrilla unit is a group of young peasants who have only recently left rural life. When his team first appeared in front of the enemy last year, there were only eight people, and only one of them knew how to shoot a gun. However, in a year of fighting the enemy, Chiang and Hu bandits equipped them with seven machine guns and more than half of the total number of American-style and Czech-style rifles and pistols. They have grown into an invincible armed force.

Tian Qiyuan pays great attention to the military and political education of his troops. Whenever they rest, they conduct various martial arts exercises or invite people to give current affairs reports. He is also meticulous in his concern for the lives of his team members, often getting up in the middle of the night to check whether his team members are sleeping well and covered with quilts. He also pays attention to the team members' daily meals and foot washing. He takes great care of the wounded and sick, often sending people or going to the rear to offer condolences himself. He said, "Our medical conditions are not good, so we should take better care of them in life." They also stipulated in the battlefield discipline: "Absolutely do not drop the bodies of any wounded or dead team members." Tian especially pays attention to the mass discipline of the troops. In a certain battle, individual team members infringed upon the interests of the masses. Tian immediately ordered, "Return the original items to the masses and apologize to the masses." He educated the team members, saying, "We cannot forget the common people just because we carry guns."

    田启元游击队升级为正规军
    【新华社西北十二日电】延（安）（安）塞游击队队长田启元曾于月前荣获陕甘宁边区政府新民主主义奖章及嘉奖令，他所率领的部队最近也已升级为正规军，他和他的部队是陕甘宁边区最著名的游击队和指挥者之一。
    田还是个青年，今年才二十六岁，在他领导下的游击队坚决英勇机智的战斗，不断打击消灭敌军。他们曾进行了有名的神灵山，延河湾等战斗，敌我伤亡为二十一比一，光复了广大地区，拔掉了十三个乡公所，有一次在延甘公路上敌人以一营兵力出发抢粮，前边是敌人保警队，后边是正规军，中间是牲口，田大胆的以两个分队突然拦腰袭敌，在短促时间内即牵回驮骡四头，并俘获人枪各四。他称之为剜心战。在胡匪大扫荡中，他们就活跃在敌人后面的交通线上。有一次，田自己穿上缴获的胡匪军衣，坐在路边，汽车一辆一辆在身边过去，到最后一辆，车上有人站起用望远镜四面了望，田猜到他是敌军军官，就猛的把手榴弹扔了上去，这次他缴获了敌第一师师长罗列的许多重要文件。
    田启元游击队和其他游击队一样，是一群才脱离农民生活的青年农民，当他的队伍去年第一次在敌人面前出现时，只有八个人，只有一个会打枪，但在一年对敌战斗中，蒋胡匪替他们装备了七挺机枪，和占总数一半以上的美国式、捷克式等长短枪。他们已壮大成一支不可战胜的武装部队。
    田启元非常注意队伍的军事和政治教育，每当休息下来就进行各种练武演习，或请人作时事报告。他对队员们生活的关心也是无微不至的，常常半夜起来检查队员们是否睡好了觉盖好了被子，队员们每天吃饭洗脚等他也注意。他对伤病员更是爱护备至，常常派人或亲自到后方慰问，他说：“我们的医药条件不好，生活上应照顾好些”。他们并在战场纪律中规定了一条：“绝对不掉一个伤亡队员的尸体。”田尤其注意队伍的群众纪律，某次战斗中有个别队员侵犯了群众利益，田即刻命令“原物交还群众，向群众道歉”，他教育队员说：“我们不能背上枪就忘了老百姓”。
