　　[Taiyue News] The Pingyao and Jiexiu militia guerrillas are cooperating with the Jinnan Liberation Army to besiege Linfen. After Yan Xishan saw the People's Liberation Army besieging Linfen, he panicked and sent three divisions of the 34th Army and one division of the 32nd Army south on April 13, planning to aid Linfen, but he did not dare to come down, just circling around Lingshi. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Pingyao and Jiexiu militias and guerrillas started fighting behind Yan's bandits, all the way to near Zhanglan Railway Station. On the 16th and 17th alone, they killed and captured 26 Yan bandits alive, and seized 7 rifles. Seeing the tight situation behind them, Yan's bandits hurriedly returned to Pingyao and Jiexiu on the 18th. Furthermore, the Pingyao's famous militia Zhang Ximan combat team and the Jiexiu Independent Battalion also made two good ambushes in Tuncun and Sendai from the 1st to the 8th, eliminating 16 Yan bandits and seizing 1 light artillery piece and 11 rifles.
