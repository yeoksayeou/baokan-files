Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 5th: Shanghai dispatch: The head of the Civil Affairs Division of the U.S. Army Department, North, and his party, who have been visiting the Far East to seek to dump Japanese goods, left Shanghai for Manila on the 1st. North and his party arrived in Nanjing on the 27th of last month and held "consultations" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's Resources Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the China Trust Bureau, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit monopoly on trade with Japan, on the issue of "promoting" Chiang-Japan trade. When North arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 29th, he revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government had adapted to the wishes of its American masters and agreed to the large-scale dumping of Japanese goods in China. North said: "Our trip has proven to be of the greatest value, and those who talked with us (referring to Chiang Kai-shek bandit officials) were particularly cooperative." North paid special attention to the dumping of Japanese cotton textiles, which has caused great unease and indignation among people in the Shanghai textile industry. They told foreign reporters that the future of China's cotton textile industry is being rapidly infringed upon by Japan, and that Japanese cotton yarn and cloth will flood the markets of South China and the interior.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 29th: Nanjing dispatch: The smuggling of goods by Japanese ships to our country and the invasion of our territorial waters by Japanese ships to fish continue to occur frequently. Following the smuggling incident of the "Nichisho Maru" and other three Japanese ships, in the middle of this month, another Japanese ship, the "Daimasa Maru," carrying Japanese goods worth approximately 20 million Taiwan dollars, arrived at Okayama port on the southwest coast of Taiwan to unload its cargo, and on the 17th, it secretly transported 500 bags of white rice to Japan. The "Nichisho Maru," which smuggled goods last time, was allowed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government to transport a second batch of 7,000 tons of Taiwan sugar from Kaohsiung safely back to Japan on the 19th. On the 17th, another four large Japanese fishing boats with concealed ship names invaded our territorial waters and fished 90 nautical miles north of Keelung, Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, May 6th: From various sources: American imperialism is continuing to support Japanese industry and support its exports in order to infringe upon Eastern countries. According to a TASS report on the 23rd of last month, the U.S. Import-Export Bank has approved a $60 million loan to Japan for American cotton. On the 22nd of last month, the U.S. Senate passed a $150 million bill to lend to Japan for the development of the textile industry, which will be allocated by the U.S. Treasury after being approved by the House of Representatives. In addition, according to Japanese Transport Minister Okada's confession on the 16th of last month, the U.S. imperialists will "rent" 500,000 tons of ships to Japan in order to develop its foreign trade. Japan has also obtained the first batch of 7,000 tons of bauxite, a raw material for aluminum production, from the Dutch East Indies government under the wings of the U.S. imperialists. With the active support of U.S. imperialism, Japan's heavy industry has repeatedly increased its production. Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani Nagasaburo stated on the 18th of last month that Japan's annual steel production has increased from the original plan of one million tons to 1.2 million tons. At the same time, the Japanese government also announced that, starting from April 1, Japan's annual coal production has increased from the original plan of 32 million tons to 36 million tons. The copper industry and the garment industry, which had stagnated after the Japanese invaders surrendered, have now resumed production and plan to export large quantities. According to Japanese government officials, Japan will export approximately 100,000 tons of copper products to Southeast Asia this year. The trade group of MacArthur Headquarters also announced on the 12th of last month that the cotton imported by Japan has been woven into more than 4 million yards of cloth, which will be made into clothing by the Japanese garment industry and exported to Southeast Asian countries. According to TASS, MacArthur has also arbitrarily allowed Japanese companies to send representatives abroad to directly negotiate trade matters with foreign companies.
