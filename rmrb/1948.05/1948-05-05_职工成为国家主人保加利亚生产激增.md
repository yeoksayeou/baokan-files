　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Sofia News: Damyanov, Chairman of the Bulgarian General Trade Union and Speaker of the National Assembly, recently wrote about the Bulgarian workers' movement fighting to build a new country, stating: The various trade unions, unified under the leadership of the General Trade Union, now have more than 600,000 members. In resolutely fulfilling the national economic plan, the General Trade Union has been working tirelessly to improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and strengthen labor discipline. The working class has developed a new attitude towards work; because they are working for themselves; they are the masters of the country, and 40% of the new managers of important industrial factories are members of the trade union. The General Trade Union promotes the competition movement, producing miracles of worker creativity. For example: workers who used to manage only two machines now manage twelve to sixteen machines; miners who mine three to seven times more coal than planned account for three-quarters of the country's total coal production. Workers in the Bolnik coal mine, under the guidance of Soviet Stakhanovite worker Boriskin, many have completed ten to thirteen times their tasks. With this determined effort of the working class, industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels by 30.5%. The General Trade Union has shattered the reactionaries' conspiracy to alienate workers and peasants, and strives to consolidate the alliance of working people in urban and rural areas. Last year, more than 60,000 work teams went to the countryside to help farmers with 5 million workdays. The General Trade Union has overcome serious post-war difficulties and greatly improved the lives of workers. Equal pay for equal work for men and women is implemented everywhere. The piece-rate wage system stimulates worker productivity and increases wages. Trade unions have opened factory canteens and established farms to supply these canteens with vegetables and meat to ensure workers' food supply and improve their lives. The General Trade Union pays special attention to workers' cultural and educational work, and night schools, training classes, and amateur art groups are generally established in factories. The General Trade Union is resolutely fighting for lasting peace and people's democracy. Bulgarian workers are determined to work with workers from other countries to ensure the unity of the world.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Budapest News: After the nationalization of large industries, Hungarian workers have become masters. Mikis, a worker at the Salgótarján Steel Plant, was promoted to manager and increased the factory's production by 60%. Ferenc, the manager of the largest steel factory in Diósgyőr, and Simili, the director of the Hatvan State-owned Sugar Factory, were previously the most beloved worker leaders in these factories. Nisvida used to be a female worker in a brick kiln, and later worked in a textile factory. Now she has become the manager of the largest textile factory in the country. The manager of another state-owned textile factory is a 27-year-old female worker who used to work in the factory. Recently, the government nationalized more than 500 industrial enterprises employing more than 100 workers, which was warmly welcomed by the workers. The slogan "We build our own country" resounds throughout factory workshops and worker meetings. When the nationalization of coal mines was discussed, the reactionaries spread rumors saying: "There will be no more coal soon." But in fact, after the nationalization of coal mines, coal production increased month by month, and now it has exceeded pre-war levels.

　　职工成为国家主人保加利亚生产激增
    【新华社陕北一日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚总工会主席、国民议会议长达米扬诺夫近撰文叙述为建设新国家而斗争的保国职工运动称：由总工会统一领导的各职工会，现有会员六十万以上。在坚决完成国家经济计划中，总工会坚持不懈地为劳动生产力的提高，生产成本的减低和劳动纪律的加强而工作着。工人阶级展开了一种对待工作的新态度；因为他们是给自己工作；他们是国家的主人，重要产业工厂的百分之四十的新经理都是职工会会员。总工会推动着竞赛运动，产生了工人群众创造性的奇迹。例如：过去只管两架机子的职工，现在管着十二架到十六架机子；矿工开采出超过计划三倍甚至七倍的煤工占全国煤总产量四分之三的波尔尼克煤矿工人，在苏联斯达哈诺夫工人鲍利斯金的教导下，许多人完成了任务的十倍至十三倍。在工人阶级这种坚决努力下，工业生产量已超过战前水平百分之三十点五。总工会曾击破反动派离间工农的阴谋，努力巩固城乡劳动人民的联盟。去年有六万多个工作队下乡，帮助农民做了五百万个工，总工会克服了战后的严重困难，大大改善工人生活。男女同工同酬到处实行。计件工资制度刺激着工人生产力；并提高了工资。职工会开办了工厂食堂，并设立了供给这些食堂以蔬菜与肉类的农场保证工人的食物供给与生活之改善。总工会对工人文教工作特别注意，工厂普遍设立有夜校、训练班、业余艺术团体。总工会坚决为持久和平与人民民主而奋斗着。保国工人决与其他各国工人一起保障世职的团结。
    【新华社陕北一日电】布达佩斯讯：在大工业国有化后，匈牙利工人已成为主人。沙尔加塔芬城大炼钢厂工人米基斯升任经理后，使工厂的生产增加了百分之六十。狄思基尔的一家最大钢铁工厂的经理费伦慈、哈特温城国营糖厂厂长西米里，从前都是这些厂中最受工友爱戴的工人领袖。尼斯维达过去是一名砖窑女工，后来又在纺织厂工作，现在已任全国最大的纺织厂的经理。另一个国营纺织厂的经理是一位以前在该厂做工的二十七岁的女工。最近政府将五百多个雇佣有一百多工人以上的工业企业收归国有，受到工人的热烈欢迎。“我们自己建设自己国家”的口号响彻各工厂车间及各工人会议。当讨论煤矿国有化时，反动派散布流言说：“快没有煤了”。而实际上，在煤矿国有化后，产煤月月增加，现在已超过战前水平。
