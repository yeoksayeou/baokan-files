　　Heard Each Person Gets a Share of Land
  　Landlord Pei of Boyan Returns
    [Wu'an News] Pei Zigang, a 60-year-old landlord from Boyan Village, Third District, fled to Anyang City in the Chiang area when the mass movement began two years ago, where he made a living running a small lumber shop. This year, Chiang bandit’s 40th Division seized the lumber from his shop. Grain was also expensive in the city, with a catty of millet costing 30,000 yuan, white flour costing 40,000 yuan, a baked wheat cake costing 10,000 yuan, and a foot of cloth costing 90,000 yuan. Most businesses were bankrupt, with only a few pharmacies and small merchants gritting their teeth to survive. Under these circumstances, Pei Zigang heard from a friend that the Land Law Outline had been issued, the liberated areas had a generous policy towards people, and returning home meant having both a house and land. The liberated areas wouldn't let a single person starve to death. He was delighted and recently ran back home. When he arrived, his family brought him a large bowl of mung bean flower soup to drink. He asked, "Why are we eating this? Can we afford it?" His family said, "This is just our regular meal." He was overjoyed and said, "If I had known it was like this, I would have returned long ago." When village cadres heard of his return, they made proper arrangements for him, allocating him 60 catties of grain to eat and telling him to work to make a living. According to Pei, "There are also some fugitive landlords in Anyang City who are planning to return home." (Sun Jing, Qi Ye, Qing Yuan, Li Zengxiang)

　　听说每人一份地
  　伯延地主回来了
    【武安消息】三区伯延村地主裴子刚，六十岁，前年群运开始时逃往蒋区安阳城，在一家小木料铺维持生活。今年该铺被蒋匪四十师将木料抢用了，城内吃粮又贵，一斤小米三万元，白面四万元，一个烧饼一万元，一尺布九万元，各商号大部倒闭。只有几家药铺和零星小商咬牙支持。裴子刚在这情形下，听到朋友说土地法大纲下来了，解放区政策待人宽大，回去又有房子又有地，解放区不叫饿死一口人，他便高兴的在最近跑了回来。到家时他家里给他端来一大碗绿豆花汤叫他喝，他说：“咱为啥吃这个？咱吃得起吗？”他家里人说：“这就是家常吃的饭”。他高兴的不得了，说：“要知道是这样，我早就回来了。”村干部听到他回来，即妥予安置，并拨给他六十斤粮吃，叫他劳动渡日。据裴说：“安阳城还有一些逃亡地主也打算回家哩。”（孙经、启业、庆远、李增祥）
