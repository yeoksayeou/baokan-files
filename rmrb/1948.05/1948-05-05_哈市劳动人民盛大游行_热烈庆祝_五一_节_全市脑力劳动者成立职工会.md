Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: The laboring people of Harbin enthusiastically celebrated their festival. Starting at 7:00 AM on "May Day" morning, workers and staff from enterprises, doctors, teachers, and others held grand parades in Daowai, Daoli, and Nangang districts. Slogans like "Develop Production, Support the Frontline" and "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, the Enemy of the Laboring People" and bright flags fluttered throughout the city. Various Yangko dance teams and propaganda vehicles shuttled through the crowds. The tram factory even dispatched floats, and the railway station also sent out a "Yangko Train." Movie theaters offered mobile screenings, providing free admission to tens of thousands of workers. A grand garden party was held in Zhaolin Park from 4:00 PM. The whole city was brightly lit at night. The telegram and telephone bureau trade union also held a street evening party and invited citizens to provide suggestions for improving work.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: The Harbin Intellectual Workers' Trade Union was established on the eve of "May Day," and elected 22 representatives to participate in the Second Harbin Workers' Representative Congress. Representatives of teachers and staff from primary, secondary, and universities in the city gathered on April 27th to formally establish the Harbin Teachers and Staff Union, electing Luo Mingzhe and three others as representatives. After several days of preparation, over a thousand employees of the Harbin Municipal Government Trade Union (including affiliated bureaus and the Garrison Hospital) requested to join the union, electing Liang Minzhong and sixteen others as representatives. Mayor Zhu Qiwen stated at the election conference: "Intellectual workers participating in the Workers' Representative Congress is the first time in Chinese history. Only in the new democratic society led by the Communist Party can intellectual workers unite and cooperate with manual laborers to develop production."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: The Harbin Democratic Youth League recently held its Third Representative Congress, with 106 representatives attending. The congress resolved to establish the Mao Zedong Youth League on May 4th, taking the league a step higher on its existing foundation. Since its establishment in August 1946, the city's Democratic Youth League has organized over 1,400 students to participate in land reform work in the suburbs and over 5,000 students to participate in army support and propaganda work in Harbin. Last year, it also mobilized over a hundred young students to participate in frontline service groups. In addition, over a thousand student league members have participated in practical revolutionary work. To date, the number of league members has expanded nearly twentyfold, and the quality of league members has also been continuously improved through practical work experience, producing a large number of activists. Jiang Nanxiang, the head of the Democratic Youth League headquarters, pointed out at the meeting that this development has created the conditions for establishing the Mao Zedong Youth League.

    【新华社东北三日电】哈市劳动人民热烈庆祝自己的节目。“五一”早晨七时起，企业工人及职员、医生、教员等分别在道外、道里、南岗三处举行盛大游行。“发展生产支援前线”“打倒劳动人民公敌蒋介石”的口号和鲜明的旗帜飘扬全市，各种秧歌队宣传车在人群中穿梭，电车厂并出动花车，火车站也出动了“秧歌列车”。电影院巡回放映，免费招待数万职工，兆麟公园从下午四时起举行盛大的游园会。入夜全市灯火辉煌，电报、电话局职工会并举行街头晚会，及邀请市民提供改进工作的意见。
    【新华社东北三日电】哈尔滨市脑力劳动者职工会已于“五一”前夕成立，并选举代表二十二人参加哈市第二届职工代表大会。该市大中小学教职员代表曾于四月二十七日集会，正式成立哈市教师职员联合会，选出罗明哲等四代表。哈市市政府职工会（包括所属各局及卫戍医院等机关），经数日酝酿后有千余员工请求入会，选出梁敏忠等十六人为代表。朱其文市长在选举大会上称：“脑力劳动者参加职工代表大会，在中国历史上尚属第一次，只有在共产党领导的新民主主义社会下，知识分子的脑力劳动者才能与体力劳动者团结合作，发展生产。”
    【新华社东北三日电】哈尔滨市民主青年联盟日前举行第三次代表大会，到会代表一百零六名。大会决议于五四成立毛泽东青年团，使该盟在现有基础上提高一步，该市民青自一九四六年八月成立以来，曾前后组织一千四百余学生参加市郊土改工作，及五千余学生参加哈市劳军与宣传等工作，去年并动员百余青年学生参加前线服务团，此外学生盟员参加实际革命工作者亦达千余名。迄今盟员已扩大近二十倍，盟员质量亦因实际工作的锻炼而日益提高，产生大批积极分子。民青总部负责人蒋南翔在会上指出这一发展使建立毛泽东青年团具备了条件。
