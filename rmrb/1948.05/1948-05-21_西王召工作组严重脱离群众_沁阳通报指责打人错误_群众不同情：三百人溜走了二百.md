[Report from our newspaper] According to a circular issued by the Qinyang Office: The West Wangzhao Work Group, in leading the masses to struggle against the landlord Zhao Xiuqing (female), committed the principle error of inciting the masses to hang and beat people, causing serious consequences. Before the struggle, knowing that Zhao Xiuqing was very tough, the work group believed that beating was necessary. Some of the masses asked: "If she doesn't admit it, would you dare to beat her?" Some answered: "Yes," some answered: "Whatever," and they also heard rumors that a beating occurred in × village and thought that the beating was not wrong. When the struggle began, the landlord was indeed very tough. A few activists shouted to beat her, and some comrades of the work group also shouted to beat her. Moreover, some comrades even personally found sticks for the masses. When a few activists hung the landlord up, and most people retreated, some comrades in the work group still mobilized the masses to come forward and beat her. When she was let down, she was half-dead, lying on the ground, and the landlord did not confess a single thing.

The masses had achieved victory in the previous struggle against this landlord, and their morale and confidence were improved. Therefore, the masses participating in this struggle were particularly enthusiastic and active. However, when a few activists and cadres used hanging and beating, the masses gradually retreated. In the end, two-thirds of the more than three hundred people left. A poor peasant committee member even pretended to be sick and hid outside the door. An old woman was so frightened that she fell to the ground as soon as she went out, and had to be helped back. Contradictions also arose within the poor peasant group due to the hanging and beating. A poor peasant committee member said: "A few people have messed things up." Activists said: "The poor peasant committee member is protecting her." This turned what could have been a better mobilization of the masses into a struggle that dampened the enthusiasm of the masses and alienated them. After the hanging and beating in West Wangzhao, people from surrounding villages such as East Shenzhao came to inquire about the news. Landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "West Wangzhao broke the person's arm (which was not true)." This caused panic in the surrounding villages.

The above errors and bad consequences were reviewed at an enlarged meeting of the central group, and self-criticism was conducted. The county party committee believed that the West Wangzhao work group had committed a principle error. In addition to helping and analyzing the bad consequences and causes of the error, the work group was also criticized.

[Another report] Yang Zhenxing of the Dalu City work group personally beat people twice when struggling against landlords and rich peasants, doing everything himself in a rough and reckless manner, which prevented the masses from being truly mobilized and lost the sympathy of the broad masses. The first time he beat someone was at the meeting to struggle against the landlord on the 19th. Before the meeting, the work group and the masses studied together, dispelling the old view of the masses that "struggle is impossible without beating and hanging," and established the new principle of not beating or detaining, but appealing to grievances and reasoning. However, when Yang Zhenxing mobilized at the struggle meeting, he said: "We don't beat good people, we don't beat landlords who bow their heads, we only beat landlords who don't bow their heads. Even if we beat you to death, we won't give you our lives. After the mobilization, the appeal to grievances began. When a landlord named Li Mifa, who had escaped from the city after being struggled against, was being accused, Li debated with the accuser. Yang stopped him from speaking, but Li continued to speak. Yang got angry and wanted to hit him. Just then, Li turned to look at Yang, and Yang immediately cursed: "You still want to shoot me in the back? I'll see if you dare to spout nonsense!" He went up and slapped him twice. After the beating, Yang said: "I have the right to beat you, I am the people's court, even if I beat you, I won't break the law." The landlord didn't say a word.

The second time was when checking the property of the rich peasant Wei Debao. Yang personally interrogated him, but Wei always said that his family started from labor and had no hidden wealth. Yang got angry and said: "I don't want your things, I just want you to bow your head!" As he spoke, he stepped forward and slapped him twice again.

After beating people, Yang Zhenxing's hand swelled up. At dinner, an old lady asked him: "Your hand is swollen, did you hit too hard? Does it hurt?" This is an irony for us. In addition, many people said: "Comrade Yang is really fierce!" He said to the poor peasants and hired laborers: "This is how you should treat landlords!" Obviously, Yang Zhenxing turned the struggle against feudalism into the rough and reckless actions of a few people, and the masses took a bystander attitude towards the beating. Because they did not see real evidence (there was no evidence at all), they believed that Yang Zhenxing's indiscriminate beating was "unreasonable." As a result, not only did it not form a mass struggle, but it also lost the sympathy of the masses. (Qinyang Office)

### 西王召工作组严重脱离群众　沁阳通报指责打人错误  群众不同情：三百人溜走了二百

　　西王召工作组严重脱离群众
  　沁阳通报指责打人错误           
    群众不同情：三百人溜走了二百
    【本报消息】据沁阳办公室通报称：西王召工作组在领导群众斗争地主赵秀清（女）时，犯了鼓动群众吊打人的原则错误，造成严重恶果。在斗争前，知道赵秀清很硬，工作组即认为不打不行。有的群众问：“她不承认时敢打不敢打？”有的答：“敢”，有的答：“随便”，更道听途说，×村打了，认为打了没错。到斗争时，地主就是很硬，少数积极分子喊打，工作组有的同志也喊打。而且有的同志还去亲自为群众找棍子。到少数积极分子将地主吊起来，大多数人往后退时，工作组同志还有人动员群众上前去打。到放下来时，人已半死，躺在地上，地主一针一线未承认。
    对这个地主的前次斗争，群众曾取得胜利，情绪与信心均提高。因之这次参加斗争的群众，特别热情与踊跃。但到少数积极分子与干部吊打仗，便逐渐后退，最后三百余群众，有三分之二都走了。一个贫农委员也装病躲到门外去了，一个老太婆由于害怕，一出门就跌倒在地，由人扶回去。贫农团内部也由于吊打人产生矛盾。贫农团委员说：“几个人把事情弄僵了。”积极分子说：“贫农委员包庇”。形成了两派。这样便把本来可以更好发动群众的斗争，变成了打击群众热情及脱离群众的斗争。西王召吊打人后，周围东申召等村均有人来探听消息。地主富农乘机造谣说：“西王召把人的臂膀打断了（实并无此事）。”造成周围村庄的恐慌。
    以上错误与恶果，经中心组扩大会议进行了检讨，作了自我批评。县委认为西王召工作组犯了原则错误，除帮助与分析认识错误之恶果及原因外，并给该工作组以指责。
    【又息】大芦城工作组杨振兴在斗争地主富农时，两次亲自动手打人，包办蛮干，使群众没真正发动好，并失掉广大群众的同情。第一次打人是十九日斗争地主的大会上。会前工作组和群众在一起研究，打通了群众“非打吊不能斗争”的旧看法，确定了不打不扣，诉苦说理的新方针。杨振兴在斗争会上动员时却说：“打人不打好人，不打低头的地主，专打不低头的地主，打死你也不会给你顶命。动员后，开始诉苦，在诉到一个从城内被斗逃到此村的地主栗米发时，栗和诉苦人辩论，杨制止他不能说，栗还在说，杨即起火想打。正这时，栗回头看杨，杨即骂起来：“你还想打我的黑枪？看你再臭嘴烂舌！”上去就是两个耳光。打完后，杨说：“我有权利打你，我是人民法庭，打了你我也犯不了法。”地主不吭了。
    第二次是在查富农卫德保的财产时，杨亲自审问，卫总是说他家里是劳动起家，没有内货，杨火了说：“我不要你的东西，就是叫你低头！”说着上前又是两耳光。
    打人后，杨振兴的手肿起来。吃饭时，老太太问他：“你手肿了，是打的太重了吧？疼不疼？”这是对我们一个讽刺。另外许多人说：“杨同志真泼呀！”他给贫雇说：“对地主就该这样才对！”显然，杨振兴把斗争封建变成了少数人的蛮干，群众对打人则是旁观态度。他们因为看不到真凭实据（根本就没证据），便认为杨振兴这种乱打是“不讲道理”。结果，不仅没有形成群众性的斗争，反而失去群众的同情。（沁阳办公室）
