    Newspaper Distribution Work Increasingly Strengthened
    Establishment of Precise Calculation and Scientific Management System
    Distribution Volume and Delivery Speed More Than Doubled in the Past Year

    In the past year, the distribution volume of this newspaper has grown from 11,243 copies in May of last year to 25,329 copies in May of this year. Regional statistics: From May of last year to May of this year, Taihang increased from 7,872 copies to 8,402 copies; Jinnan increased from 2,235 copies to 7,888 copies; Taiyue increased from 1,072 copies to 5,410 copies; Jilu Yu increased from 64 copies to 3,431 copies; the distribution volume in other regions was 198 copies. In terms of distribution area, from May of last year to April of this year, the entire region increased from 101 counties to 173 counties. Among them, Taihang increased from 41 counties to 42 counties (accounting for 100% of the entire region); Jinnan increased from 35 counties to 43 counties; Taiyue increased from 23 counties to 40 counties (including two counties in western Henan); Jilu Yu increased from 2 counties to 48 counties. (External areas such as Jin Sui, Ji Zhong, and Jin Cha Ji are not included in the calculation.)
    Thanks to the efforts of the post office, the importance attached to the task of Party newspaper distribution, and the determination to increase delivery speed by all means, the newspaper distribution work has been strengthened. For example, adding night shifts, mobilizing postal workers to carry out speed-up movements, establishing reward systems, adding transportation tools, carrying out rural postal construction, etc., and with the help of the Department of Transportation, using modern transportation tools such as trains and automobiles, the delivery speed of newspapers has more than doubled in the past year. Last year, it took four days to reach Changzhi, nine days to reach Jincheng, two days to reach Handan, and seven days to reach Linqing; this year, it only takes two days to reach Changzhi, four days to reach Jincheng, and the newspapers can be seen on the same day in eighteen counties including Handan, Linqing, Weixian, Yongnian, Shahe, and Xingtai.
    Regarding the internal work of the distribution section, various registration and statistical systems have been improved and re-established based on the development and progress of the work, and various forms have been formulated to avoid various obstacles and errors in distribution in the past. (There are more than 20 kinds of forms for the distribution stock and business stock, including Daily Newspaper Distribution Statistics Table, Daily Newspaper Distribution Time Statistics Table, Error Statistics Table, Distribution Survey Statistics Table, Delivery Book, Dispatch Book, Distribution Target Statistics Table, Newspaper Distribution Notice, Monthly Distribution Business Status Table, Monthly Business Trial Calculation Table, Daily Newspaper Distribution Statistics Table, Subscription Registration Book, Incoming Letter Registration Book, Bound Volume and Retail Newspaper Notice, Monthly Subscription Report, Monthly Report of Newspaper Fee Deposits and Arrears, Account of Newspaper Fee Deposits and Arrears by Account, Daily Subscription Summary Table, Distribution Statistics by County and Region, Mailing Postage Registration Table, and Trunk Line Bureau Station Mileage Survey Table.) For example, in the past, the business stock's accounting books and subjects were not sound enough, so the accounting books and subjects were appropriately redefined according to the development of the business. In order to facilitate readers' subscriptions, newspaper fees are calculated based on the actual number of copies distributed. In order to improve work efficiency and eliminate the phenomenon of writing wrong newspaper wrappers, the distribution stock has changed to using newspaper labels, so that the phenomenon of writing wrong newspaper wrappers and the post office being unable to forward them no longer occurs. In order to overcome the phenomenon of newspaper wrappers being damaged, newspaper labels falling off, and newspapers being unable to be forwarded and returned, a double newspaper label method has been adopted. The newspaper distribution is organized by division of labor. Originally, it took four people all day to distribute more than 6,000 copies a day, which could not keep up with the post office's shift times. Later, it was changed to east and west lines for distribution, coordinated with the post office's shift times, and set for two batches of distribution in the morning and evening, shortening the distribution time by two hours, gradually reducing the phenomenon of not keeping up with the post office's shift times. After the post office developed and increased its speed movement in May, we competed with the post office to shorten the time, and the phenomenon of not keeping up with the post office's shift times was completely eliminated. The mutual connection with the post office has also been greatly strengthened compared to the past. We constantly participate in post office meetings, listen to the post office's opinions on us to improve our work. We have reached unanimous agreement with the post office in terms of time changes, increasing the number of newspapers, and increasing quotations, or jointly issued joint notices, and achieved unified action in newspaper distribution. In addition, after the cadres of the distribution section studied the "three check-ups", they overcame the idea that distribution work had no future in the past, eliminated the phenomenon of not being content with their work, and strengthened their sense of responsibility, so that our distribution work could gradually develop.

    本报发行工作日益加强
    建立精确计算与科学管理制度
    发行份数送报速度一年来增加一倍多
    一年来，本报的发行数量，由去年五月一万一千二百四十三份，到今年五月发展到二万五千三百二十九份。分区域统计：从去年五月到今年五月，太行由七八七二份增到八四○二份；冀南由二二三五份增到七八八八份；太岳由一○七二份增到五四一○份；冀鲁豫由六四份增到三四三一份；外区发行数量为一九八份。在发行区域上，去年五月份至今年四月份，全区由一百零一个县增加到一百七十三个县。其中太行由四十一个县增加到四十二个县（占全区百分之百）；冀南由三十五个县增加到四十三个县；太岳由二十三个县增加到四十个县（其中豫西二个县）；冀鲁豫由二个县增加到四十八个县。（外区晋绥、冀中、晋察冀等未计算）
    由于邮局方面的努力，对党报发行任务的重视，想尽各种办法增加送报速度，加强报纸发行工作。如添设夜班，发动邮工进行增快速度运动，建立奖励制度，添设运输工具，进行乡邮建设等，并在交通厅的帮助下利用火车汽车等近代化交通工具，使一年来报纸的寄送速度增加了一倍以上。去年到长治四天、晋城九天、邯郸两天、临清七天；今年到长治则只用两天，晋城四天，邯郸、临清、威县、永年、沙河、邢台等十八个县份当天即能看到报纸。
    在发行科内部工作方面，根据工作发展进步改进并从新建立各种登记及统计制度，制订各种表册，避免过去在发行上的各种障碍及错误。（发报股及业务股表册共有二十多种，有每日发报份数统计表、每日发报时间统计表、差错统计表、发行调查统计表、送报簿、发致簿、发行对象统计表、发报通知单、每月发行营业状况表、每月营业试算表、发报逐日统计表、预订登记簿、来信登记簿、合订本及零售报纸通知单、订报月报表、报费存欠月报表、报费存欠分户帐、订报逐日合计表、发行分县分区统计表、发信邮资登记表、干线局站里程调查表等。）如业务股过去在会计上帐簿科目不够健全，根据业务发展，适当的重新确定帐簿科目。为了读者订报方便，报费按实发数计算。发报股为了提高工作效率，消灭写错报皮现象，改用报签，使写错报皮，邮局无法转递的现象不再发生。并为了克服中途报皮损坏、报签脱落、报纸无法转递而退回的现象，采取了双份报签办法。发报实行分工组织，原来一天四人发六千多份，需时整日，赶不上邮局班次时间，后改为东西两线分发，配合邮局班次时间，定为早晚两批分发，使发报时间缩短两个钟头，使赶不上邮局班次的现象逐步减少。从五月后邮局发展增加速度运动，我们即与邮局竞赛缩短时间，赶不上邮局班次的现象就完全消灭了。在与邮局的互相连系上，也比过去大大加强，邮局开会我们不断参加，听取邮局对我们的意见来改进我们的工作。在时间变动，增加报纸数量，增加报价等方面，都与邮局取得一致意见，或共同发联合通知，在报纸发行上取得一致行动。加以发行科干部自三查学习以后，克服了过去认为发行工作没有前途的思想，消除了不安心工作的现象，加强了工作责任心，使我们的发行工作能逐步开展起来。
