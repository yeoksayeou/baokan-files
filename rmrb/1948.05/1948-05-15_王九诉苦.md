Wang Jiu's Lament
Sun the Landlord
　　Entering the village, no need to ask,
　　Every stone, big or small, belongs to Sun.
　　Sun the Landlord covers heaven and earth with one hand,
　　A poor boy dies with nowhere to be buried.
　　Sun the Landlord has courtyards in front and behind his tile-roofed house,
　　A poor boy runs naked along the eaves.
　　Sun the Landlord’s old rice grows worms,
　　In the poor boy's vegetable pot, you can see your reflection in the thin gruel.
　　Sun the Landlord stomps his foot in the street,
　　Scaring the poor boy out of his wits.
　　Sun the Landlord clicks and clacks his abacus,
　　Calculating away one family after another.

Wang Jiu's Account
　　In the eighth month, the autumn wind blows cool,
　　Sorghum and millet are harvested in the field.
　　The landlord sends his watchdog,
　　Carrying sacks to collect rent grain.
　　Open the ledger and take a look,
　　"Wang Jiu owes seven stones of rent."
　　I hold up that bottomless peck with both hands,
　　Tears streaming down along the peck.
　　Measuring one stone after another,
　　Isn't every grain of millet soaked in blood and sweat?
　　Even after paying, I still owe two stones and three pecks,
　　Hard work all year leads to another year of poverty.
　　My, Wang Jiu's, heart feels like it's being cut with a dull knife,
　　The bowl is snatched away right as the food reaches my mouth.
　　　× × ×
　　In the tenth year of the Republic of China, there was a famine,
　　I went to the landlord to borrow bran;
　　The well-fed man does not know the hungry man's hunger,
　　How can the rich man have poor people in his eyes?
　　"I pity you, but who will pity me?
　　I have no way, who can I turn to?"
　　"Sir, please accumulate virtue and do good deeds.
　　I will never forget your kindness even in death."
　　"I'll lend you one and a half pecks of coarse bran,
　　I still have to throw the fine bran to feed the pigs."
　　When people are poor, their ambitions are short, what can I do?
　　I, Wang Jiu, am not even as good as Sun the Landlord's pig.
　　　× × ×
　　Unable to pay off the rent,
　　I became a long-term worker for the landlord,
　　A long-term worker is more miserable than livestock,
　　Beaten and scolded, tears falling.
　　Drawing water before the fourth watch, before the sky is light,
　　The landlord curses from the quilt:
　　"When will you ever be able to pay it off?
　　Sleep dead on the kang, not worth a thing!"
　　Before the sun rises, I go to the fields,
　　Returning with a sky full of stars overhead.
　　Coming back from the fields, I still have to carry water,
　　So tired that my back aches and my bones hurt.
　　The landlord has three meals a day,
　　Drinking wine and stir-frying dishes, eating white flour.
　　The long-term worker has three meals of thin soup,
　　Tree-leaf buns mixed with bran,
　　Light a match,
　　The life of a long-term worker is full of suffering.
　　× × ×
　　In the fifth and sixth months, when the crops are not yet ripe,
　　I, Congcong, was cutting elm leaves in the fields,
　　Seeing that my Congcong was growing well,
　　Sun the Landlord had evil thoughts in his heart.
　　With stars all over the sky, at the second watch,
　　Sun the Landlord brought people to snatch Congcong,
　　Forcing my Congcong to kowtow in the wedding hall,
　　My Congcong crying and cursing, tears streaming down:
　　"You old beast, you are not raised by humans!
　　Why don't you take your own daughter?"
　　His dog face changed, filled with anger,
　　He picked up the horsewhip and lashed out:
　　"Today, whether you want to or not,
　　Your life is in my hands!"
　　The horsewhip rose without mercy,
　　Congcong cried and screamed, unable to speak.
　　Just as the rooster crowed, before the sky was light,
　　My Congcong hanged herself on the apricot tree.
　　× × ×
　　Congcong died at the hands of the Sun family,
　　When will this blood debt be repaid?
　　My old father got typhoid fever from anger,
　　His condition worsened day by day.
　　He didn't eat or drink for ten days,
　　He wanted to eat a sour pear but had no money,
　　I quietly picked a pear under the tree,
　　And met that dog Sun the Landlord.
　　Another great disaster fell from the sky,
　　He jumped and cursed at my door:
　　"You stand under my sky, you tread on my land,
　　You eat my food, and you steal my pears!"
　　He dragged my old father to the ground with one hand:
　　"You poor boy, get out of here!"
　　My old father died from the fall,
　　My whole family cried as one voice.
　　New hatred and old resentment are as deep as the sea,
　　I, Wang Jiu, sued at the county yamen.
　　× × ×
　　If you have reason but no money, don't come in;
　　Sun the Landlord sent five taels of opium,
　　The magistrate's face lit up with joy.
　　Without asking right or wrong,
　　He hung me up like a duck floating on water.
　　"You were born to be poor,
　　Committing evil and not being upright.
　　Sun the Landlord is one hundred and one to you,
　　Don't be ungrateful, you poor bones!"
　　When will my, Wang Jiu's, grievances be avenged?
　　There is no way out for the poor.
　　The rich can buy ghosts to push the mill,
　　The poor have nowhere to speak their grievances.
　　× × ×
　　The northwest wind blows hard, freezing the dripping water,
　　My whole family was driven out to flee for our lives.
　　Forcing people to die in the twelfth month,
　　Kneeling in the Earth God temple, begging the gods.
　　"Earth God, please have mercy,
　　Let my family spend the winter in your dwelling."
　　The window frames are broken, the snow pushes in the door,
　　People freeze to death in the middle of the night,
　　The children are frozen like naked birds,
　　Crying "Daddy, Mommy," it breaks your heart.
　　Knife point cuts the heart, intestines are shattered,
　　Are we, the poor, destined to suffer forever?

Accusation
　　So many years of suffering,
　　Even cloudy days will turn sunny,
　　The big poplar leaves rustle,
　　A big meeting under the poplar tree,
　　Sun the Landlord tied with a hemp rope,
　　Eggplants past their prime, drooping tobacco,
　　Wang Jiu's heart is like a boiling pot,
　　Decades of bitterness flow into a river.
　　"You forced my father to die, one life for a life,
　　You forced my Congcong to hang herself!
　　You relied on your power to break into my house,
　　You forced me out in the twelfth month!"
　　Wang Jiu's bitterness cannot be poured out,
　　Tears welling up as he speaks of the suffering:
　　"Sun the Landlord, you must pay for murder with your life,
　　Sun the Landlord, your exploitation must be settled!
　　I have suffered so many years of humiliation from you,
　　Today I will turn myself over!"
　　Before Wang Jiu finished speaking,
　　The peasant's slogans resounded through the sky,
　　"Years of grievances, years of debt,
　　Today we will collect them all!
　　Overthrow the landlord and feudalism,
　　Let's, the poor, turn ourselves over!"

Fourth Year, Seventh Month, Eighth [Day].

    王九诉苦
    孙老财
     进了村子不用问，
     大小石头都姓孙。
     孙老财一手把天地盖，
     穷小子死了没处埋。
     孙老财瓦房前院连后院，
     穷小子光着屁股串房檐。
     孙老财的陈米生了虫，
     穷小子菜锅粥里照人影。
     孙老财街里一跺脚，
     吓得穷小子不知怎么好。
     孙老财算盘排扒打，
     算光了一家又一家。
  王九的帐
     八月里来秋风凉，
     高粱谷子齐上场。
     老财打发看家狗，
     带着口袋收租粮。
     打开帐本看一看，
     “王九欠租整七石。”
     我双手捧起那没梁儿的斗，
     眼泪滚滚顺斗流。
     量了一石又一石，
     那一粒谷子不是血和汗？
     交光了还欠两石三，
     辛苦一年穷一年。
     我王九心象钝刀儿割，
     饭到嘴边把碗夺。
      ×  ×          ×
     民国十年闹灾荒，
     我向老财去借糠；
     饱汉子不知饿汉子饥，
     财主眼里哪有穷人的？
     “我可怜你谁可怜我，
     我没办法找哪个？”
     “大爷你积德多行好。
     你的恩我死也忘不了。”
     “借给你粗糠一斗五，
     细糠我还要丢着去喂猪。”
     人穷志短莫奈何，
     我王九不如孙老财的猪。
        ×  ×          ×
     欠下租子还不清，
     我给老财当长工，
     长工要比牲灵苦，
     挨打受骂泪零零。
     四更打水天不明，
     老财被窝里骂几声：
     “什么时候你还不起，
     睡死在炕上不动秤！”
     太阳没出下地去，
     回来顶着满天星。
     下地回来还挑水，
     累得腰酸骨头疼。
     老财一天三顿饭，
     喝酒炒菜吃白面。
     长工三顿稀汤汤，
     树叶饽饽掺上糠，
     划根洋火点着了，
     长工的生活苦难当。
      ×          ×          ×
     五风六月青黄不接，
     俺葱葱在地里勒榆叶，
     见俺葱葱长得好，
     孙老财心里生了鬼道。
     满天星斗打了二更，
     孙老财带人来抢葱葱，
     立逼着俺葱葱拜花堂，
     俺葱葱连哭带骂泪汪汪：
     “老畜牲你不是人养的！
     你为啥不要你亲姑娘？”
     他狗脸子一变气冲天，
     顺手提起了马鞭鞭：
     “今个你愿意不愿意，
     你的命就在我手心里！”
     马鞭子抬起不留情，
     葱葱叫骂哭不成声。
     鸡儿刚叫天没亮，
     俺葱葱吊死在杏树上。
          ×          ×          ×
     葱葱死在孙家手，
     这一笔血债几时勾？
     老爹一气得了伤寒，
     病势一天重一天。
     十来天水米不下口，
     想吃个酸梨又没钱，
     我悄悄到树下摘个梨，
     碰见老财狗日的。
     又一场大祸从天降，
     他跳脚骂到家门上：
     “你顶着我家天，踩着我家地，
     你吃的我的饭，还偷我的梨！”
     一手把老爹拉在地：
     “穷小子给我滚出去！”
     老爹一摔丧了命，
     我全家哭成一个声。
     新仇旧恨似海深，
     我王九告到了县衙门。
        ×    ×    ×
     有理没钱别进来；
     孙老财送去五两大烟土，
     老爷一见喜颜开。
     青红皂白先不问，
     鸭子浮水把我吊起来。
     “你生来就是受穷的命，
     为非做歹不正经。
     孙老财对你一百一，
     穷骨头你别不识抬举！”
     俺王九冤仇何日报？
     穷人的活路没一条。
     有钱人买得鬼推磨，
     穷汉子有理没处说。
          ×    ×    ×
     西北风紧吹滴水成冰，
     我全家被赶去逃生。
     十冬腊月逼人死，
     跪在土地庙求神灵。
     “土地爷爷你可邻见，
     借你的住处我家过个冬。”
     窗棂儿刮断雪推门，
     深更半夜冻死人，
     孩子冻的象个光翅鸟，
     “爹呀娘呀”哭得好心伤。
     刀尖剜心肠子碎，
     咱穷人呀！就永世得受罪？
  控诉
     苦难的日子多少年，
     阴天也会变晴天，
     大杨叶儿哗哗响，
     杨树底下大会场，
     孙老财一条麻绳拴，
     打籽的茄子落架的烟，
     王九的心里象开了锅，
     几十年的苦水流成河。
     “你逼死我父命一条，
     你逼着我葱葱上了吊！
     你仗势打了俺家门，
     你逼我十冬腊月往出跑！”
     王九的苦水吐不完，
     说到苦处泪涟涟：
     “孙老财你杀人要偿命，
     孙老财你剥削要清算！
     受了你多少年窝囊气
     我今天就要把身翻！”
     王九的话没说完，
     农民的口号响震了天，
     “多少年的冤仇多少年的债
     今天要一总交出来
     斗倒地主和封建。
     咱们穷人来翻身！”
      四七，八。
