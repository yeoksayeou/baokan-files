　　Great Victory in Western Wan
　　Starting from the first of this month, the People's Liberation Army, led by Generals Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi of our Central Plains Front, launched a powerful offensive against the Wanxi area in southwestern Henan. After ten days of fighting, they captured the four county towns of Neixiang, Xichuan, Zhenping, and Dengxian, and seven important market towns including Xixiakou, eliminating more than 9,900 Chiang bandit troops, achieving a great victory.
　　Wan is the abbreviation for Nanyang. Western Wan includes four counties, spanning two to three hundred li horizontally and vertically, bordering Shaanxi to the west and Hubei to the southwest. By occupying this area, we can directly attack Hanzhong to the west, threatening the rear of Xi'an; to the south, we can strike northern Hubei, controlling the fertile Han River basin and further consolidating the Jianghan Liberated Area. However, the more significant meaning is that the lair of the Chiang bandit Henan local armed forces has been uprooted. This was originally where the Chiang bandits trained local bandits. The Chiang bandits had constantly bragged about how formidable the local bandits in western Henan were, but as soon as our People's Liberation Army took action, it shattered them into pieces. It won't be difficult to completely eliminate the remaining bandits. This great victory is of great significance to the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi and the entire Central Plains war situation.

　　宛西大胜利
    从本月一日开始，咱们中原前线刘伯承、陈毅等将军率领的解放军，对河南西南部宛西地区发动强大的进攻，经过十天战斗，打下内乡、淅川、镇平、邓县四个县城，和西峡口等七个重要集镇，消灭蒋匪九千九百多人，得到很大胜利。
    宛是南阳的简名，宛西包括四县，横直有二三百里，西面靠陕西，西南和湖北搭界。咱们占了这块地方，向西可以直接进攻汉中，威胁西安的背后；向南可以打鄂北，掌握肥沃的汉水流域，使江汉解放区更加巩固。但更重大的意义，是把蒋匪河南团队的老窝挖掉了。这里原是蒋匪训练团匪的地方，蒋匪曾不断吹牛皮，说豫西的团匪怎么了不得，但咱们解放军刚一出手，便把它打得稀哩哗啦，残匪不难全部扫清。这一大胜利，对豫鄂陕三省边境和整个中原战局都有很大的意义。
