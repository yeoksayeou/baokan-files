　　【Taiyue News】Xucun, Yicheng, began to correct the mistakes of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants, and the mood for production gradually improved. This spring, Liu Zhenren, the village cadre who was removed from his post, used the names of poor and hired peasants to act recklessly. He sealed the doors of twelve middle peasant families, including Jia Ligong's, and nailed doorplates to them, with identity cards, writing words like "reactionary," "political bully," "gold and silver landlord," and "collaborator with the Japanese army." He also set three rules: if anyone was ashamed and did not wear their ID card on their chest, first there would be a "brick meeting," second, they would have words tattooed on their forehead, and third, they would be handed over to the masses for disposal. He also forced the women of several families, including Jia Zhanbiao's, to divorce and marry hired and poor peasants. The secretary of the Second District Committee went there to work. After investigation, on April 7, he convened a meeting of all the peasants, explaining that hired, poor, and middle peasants are one family and that it is wrong to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants. Those whose doors were sealed should have them opened, and those who were harmed should be compensated. After the meeting, he went to the homes of middle peasants to talk to them. Qin Liansheng said, "The laws and regulations of the Communist Party are dead, but the methods are flexible." He was afraid that the district cadres would leave and the village cadres would retaliate. The next day, another meeting was held, and it was clearly affirmed: not only today should we unite with the middle peasants, but also in the future. Whoever retaliates against the middle peasants will be punished by law. It was also publicly announced that all illegal controls and big hats placed on the heads of middle peasants would be lifted. On the 10th, village cadres accompanied the middle peasants whose doors were sealed to open them and hand over the items in person. The losses that had already been incurred were compensated for with the fruits of struggle. Only then did the middle peasants begin to feel at ease. Jia Zhanbiao had a plow and planned to carry it to Weizhuang market to exchange for wheat to eat. Now he would not sell it, no matter the price, and would keep it for his own use. Jia Zhanxiang went out to plow the fields at dawn. In the past twenty days, two-thirds of the village's land has been plowed, and manure has been delivered to the fields. However, because some middle peasants' items have not yet been compensated (for example, the hired and poor peasants ate six sheep and a pig belonging to Jia Pei＠ without compensation; Jia Zhanxue's cart of coal, five packages of matches, a felt blanket, two sacks, a fountain pen, and a pair of glasses were confiscated and have not yet been compensated), the middle peasants' emotions are still not very clear, and further resolution is needed.

　　许村坚决纠偏
  　中农情绪好转
    【太岳消息】翼诚许村开始纠正侵犯中农的错误，生产情绪逐渐提高。该村被撤职干部刘振仁今春利用贫雇农名义蛮干，查封了贾立功等十二家中农的门，还给钉上门牌，带上身份证，写着“反动派”、“政治恶霸”、“金银地主”、“勾皇军”等字样，还定了三条纪律：若有人害丑，不把身份证带在胸前，一要开“砖头会”，二要头上剌字，三要交群众处理。又强迫贾占标等几家女人离婚，嫁给雇贫农。二区分委书记去那里工作，经过调查后，在四月七日召开全体农民大会，说明雇贫中农是一家，侵犯中农利益是错误的，封门的要开门，损害的要赔偿。散会后又到中农家里去谈心。秦连生说：“共产党的法令是死的，办法是活的。”他怕区干部走了，村干部报复。第二天又开了一次会，肯定的讲清楚：不只今天要团结中农，将来也是如此。谁要向中农报复，就会受到法律制裁。又当众宣布取消一切非法管制和戴到中农头上的大帽子。十号就由村干部随同被封门的中农去开门，当面点交东西。已损失的用斗争果实补偿了，这才开始叫中农安下心来。贾占标有一个犁，计划扛到卫庄集上去换麦子吃，现在贵贱不卖了，要留着自己用。贾占祥天刚明就出去犁地。二十天来，全村已有三分之二的地犁过，粪土送到了地里。但因有些中农的东西还未补偿（如雇贫吃了贾佩＠的六个羊、一口猪，没有赔；没收了贾占薛的一车煤、五包火柴、一条毡、两条口袋、一支水笔、一付眼镜，也至今未赔），中农情绪上还不很通，需要继续解决。
