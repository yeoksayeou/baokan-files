　　The most important event of this week was the Soviet government's proactive publication of the contents of the Soviet-American notes on May 10th. This declared the Soviet Union's solemn stance on foreign policy, refuted the slanderous accusations in the Smith Note, and clearly stated that the Soviet government supported "improving current US-Soviet relations." It pointed out that the US imperialists' frenzied arms race and expansionist policies are the root cause of the world's stalemated situation. The first to be extremely embarrassed after the note was published was Washington. After Truman and Marshall held a series of furtive secret meetings, Truman and Marshall issued a statement declaring that "the US government's position remains unchanged." This action by US imperialism demonstrates its outwardly fierce but inwardly weak nature. Not only has the paper tiger been exposed, but it also shows that it is deeply mired in the quagmire of its own making and unable to extricate itself. However, people all over the world have unanimously supported the Soviet note, enthusiastically praising it as "a major contribution to the cause of defending peace." Although British officials expressed "great surprise" and complained that "an embarrassed America must explain to its possibly angry British and French allies what exactly the United States is doing behind their backs" (Associated Press), most British newspapers had a "positive reaction." Even figures like Senator Connally and House Speaker Martin, who were known for their anti-Soviet stance, were forced to recognize "the need to welcome the start of US-Soviet negotiations" due to the American people's firm opposition to war and their strong dissatisfaction with the impending economic crisis. All of this reflects the irresistibility of the fighting spirit and great power of the people around the world who demand peace and oppose war-mongering. Under this strong internal and external pressure, and with its own increasing isolation and the imminent crisis, US imperialism was forced to first "take emergency measures to alleviate the anxieties of the American people, who are difficult to deal with, about war mania" (Pravda Observer). The anti-Soviet propaganda offensive and frenzied war-mongering that had reached a fever pitch since March of this year were transformed into a secret, non-public expression to the Soviet government: "There is no hostility or aggressive intent towards the Soviet Union," and "Detailed discussions and solutions to US-Soviet differences" (US Note language).

    As the French Communist Party's newspaper L'Humanité pointed out, this move by US imperialism naturally contains diplomatic conspiracies, as well as strategies for preparing for the presidential election and dealing with its domestic political enemies. The fact that Truman and Marshall declared on the 11th that "the US position remains unchanged" and the news revealed by the American news agency that "Washington originally did not believe that Moscow would respond to this note" is enough to illustrate this point. However, this event itself is a profound blow to all kinds of reactionaries who make a living by claiming that a third world war is inevitable. Exposing the content of the paper tiger for what it is is the best education for the cowardly and ignorant sufferers of Americaphobia. The outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of US imperialism and the impending domestic crisis fill the Chinese people with even greater confidence to completely and thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and promote the early realization of the victory of the national New Democratic Revolution.

    US imperialism has also encountered strong resistance from democratic forces at home. The wave of protests against the Mundt anti-communist and anti-democratic bill has now spread throughout the United States, and participants include people from all walks of life. The "Democratic Rights Committee," led by Senator Taylor and ten congressmen, is also organizing a 2,000-person "petition delegation to Washington" to demand that Congress reject the Mundt fascist bill. Even the people of the American South, who have always been influenced by conservatism, have risen up to fight against oppression. Southern blacks and whites have jointly formed the "People's Progressive Party," declaring their support for Wallace. Fearing the growing strength of the democratic and resistance movements, Truman was forced to hypocritically declare: "Making any political party illegal is contrary to American policy" (Associated Press).

    Over the past week, people all over the world have protested with strong anger against the atrocities of US imperialism colluding with the Greek puppet government to collectively massacre Greek patriots. Progressive groups and democrats in Europe and the United States have unanimously cried out: "End the slaughter in Greece!" The "American Committee for a Democratic Greece," in its series of protests, also demanded that Truman recall "the executioner of Greek democracy," Griswold, the head of the US aid mission to Greece.

### 美帝疯狂备战与侵略政策是造成世界僵局根本原因

　　美帝疯狂备战与侵略政策是造成世界僵局根本原因
    本周最重要的大事，就是五月十日，苏联政府主动地公布了苏美照会的内容，申明了苏联外交政策的严正立场，批驳了史密斯照会中含血喷人的各种污蔑，明确地表明了苏联政府是赞成“改善目前美苏关系”，并指出美帝国主义的疯狂备战与扩张政策乃是造成世界僵局的根本原因。这照会发表之后，极形狼狈的首先是华盛顿。杜鲁门马歇尔整日鬼鬼祟祟与秘密召开一连串座谈会之后，即由杜鲁门马歇尔发出声明，表示“美国政府立场不变。”美帝国主义的这一行动，正说明其色厉内荏，外强中干，不但纸老虎已经戳穿，而且又显出了它已深深陷入自己造成的泥沼而无法超拔。但全世界人民则一致拥护与支持苏联的照会，热烈赞扬它“是对保卫和平事业的重大贡献”。英官方虽表示“大吃一惊”，埋怨地表示“狼狈不堪的美国，必须向其可能气愤的英法盟国说明究竟美国在他们背后干些什么勾当”（合众社）。英国的大多数报纸却一致具有“积极的反应”。甚至向以反苏著称的美参议员康纳利与众院议长马丁之流，亦因美国广大人民坚决反对战争与对经济危机迫近的强烈不满，也被迫认为“有欢迎苏美开始谈判的必要”了。这一切反映了全世界人民要求和平、反对战争叫嚣的斗志与伟力，是如何不可抗拒。美帝就在这种内外的强大压力与本身越益孤立与危机迫在眉睫的情况下，不得不首先“采取紧急措施，以减轻很难对付的美国人民对战争狂之焦虑”（真理报观察家）；不得不自今年三月以来登峰造极的反苏宣传攻势与疯狂的战争叫嚣，一变而为秘密不公开的向苏联政府表示：“对苏无任何敌视与侵略意图”、“详尽讨论并解决美苏之分歧”（美照会语）。
    诚如法共机关报人道报所指出一样，美帝的这一着棋，自然包含有外交阴谋，以及准备总统竞选与对付其国内政敌的策略成份在内。十一日杜鲁门马歇尔声明“美国立场不变”和美国通讯社所透露的“华盛顿原本不相信莫斯科对此照会会有所表示”的消息，就足以说明这一点。然而这事件本身，就深重的打击了靠世界三次大战不可避免论吃饭的各色反动派。拆穿了纸老虎的内容原来如此，对怯懦无知的恐美病者就是最好的教育。美帝的外强中干与国内危机山雨欲来的局面，使中国人民更充满信心去全部干净彻底地消灭蒋介石匪帮，促进全国新民主主义革命胜利的早日实现。
    美帝在国内亦遭到民主势力的有力抗击。反对蒙特反共反民主法案的抗议浪潮，现已遍及全美，参加者已包括各阶层人士。以参议员泰勒及十位众议员为首的“民主权利委员会”并筹组两千人的“赴华盛顿请愿队”，要求国会否决蒙特法西斯法案。甚至一向受保守影响的美国南部人民亦起来作反压迫的斗争，南方黑人和白人已联合组成“人民进步党”，声明拥护华莱士。慑于民主与反抗运动的日壮，迫使杜鲁门亦不得不虚伪地声言：“使任何政党成为非法，这是与美国政策相矛盾的”（合众社）。
    一周来，全世界人民以强烈的愤怒，抗议美帝勾结希伪政府集体杀戮希爱国人士的暴行。欧美进步团体和民主人士一致大声疾呼：“结束希腊的屠杀！”“美民主希腊委员会”在其一连串的抗议声中，亦要求杜鲁门撤回“希腊民主的刽子手”——美援希代表团团长格利斯伍德。
