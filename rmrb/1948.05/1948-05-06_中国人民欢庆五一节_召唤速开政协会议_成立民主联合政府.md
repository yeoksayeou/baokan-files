    In the past week, the working people of the world, in welcoming and celebrating May Day, have held high the banner of fighting to defend peace, democracy, freedom, and independence, demonstrating unparalleled power, firm conviction in victory, and fighting spirit.
    On this "day for reviewing the fighting strength of the working people of all countries," the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on the working people of all countries to unite, "expose the aggressive conspiracies of the instigators of a new war, and guard peace," and "destroy the plans of imperialism to bind and enslave the people of all countries." On that day, celebrations and grand parades were held everywhere in the Soviet Union. The Soviet armed forces and millions of people in the capital held a grand review in Red Square. Waves of aircraft soared through the sky, and lines of artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, motorcycles, and cavalry sped past. Millions of participants formed a giant torrent, with cheers and songs resounding across the earth, demonstrating the invincible heroic spirit and power of the Soviet people.
    Millions of working people in the new democracies of Eastern Europe held rallies and celebratory parades, joyfully and confidently shouting: "People's country is paradise on earth," "Strive towards socialism," "Consolidate world peace and democracy," "Thank and be loyal to the People's Republic."
    In the capitalist world, the working people, regardless of intimidation and oppression, staged militant demonstrations against domestic reactionaries and foreign enslavers such as American imperialism on the holiday. Millions of workers in Paris and one hundred thousand working people in Rome held unprecedentedly grand rallies and parades under the slogans of striving for peace, bread, freedom, and independence. Seven hundred thousand people in Berlin marched, demanding: "Give the German people unity, peace, freedom, and independence!" Under the guard and suppression of the Japanese police, assisted by the U.S. occupation authorities, a million working people in Tokyo still held demonstrations against the reactionary Ashida government. Demonstrations were also held in cities such as New York in the United States, opposing war maniacs, conscription, and anti-labor laws. The storm of demonstrations also swept through countries such as Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Indonesia, and India.
    The Chinese people, with pride and excitement, congratulated this "day of marching towards national victory." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to which the hopes of the people of the whole country are pinned, pointed out in its May Day slogans: "Chiang Kai-shek's sham presidency is a sign that he is about to go to the guillotine." It also issued a heartening call to all democratic parties, people's organizations, and social elites: "Convene the Political Consultative Conference quickly to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's representative conference and the establishment of a democratic coalition government!"
    Another major event in the East worthy of attention this week is the great unity of the Korean people in their struggle for independence, democracy, and unification. The joint conference of democratic parties and organizations from North and South Korea, representing more than ten million organized people, has successfully concluded. The conference has decided to launch a nationwide boycott movement against the divisive sham election orchestrated by American imperialism in South Korea. Representatives of the South Korean General Federation of Trade Unions stated at the meeting that South Korean workers would set an example by not participating in the sham election. At the same time, the South Korean people's struggle to boycott the sham election is rising. Despite the US military authorities' use of all vile means such as intimidation and violent suppression, they will never be able to make the South Korean people submit. The traditional indomitable spirit of the Korean people is also reflected in the recent heroic struggle of Korean residents in Japan against the oppression of the US and Japanese authorities. Korean residents, using their bare hands against armed police, stormed the county government and held large-scale demonstrations. With such a united and militant Korean people, their future is infinitely bright.

　　中国人民欢庆五一节
  　召唤速开政协会议
  　成立民主联合政府
    一周来，世界劳动人民在迎接与庆祝五一节声中，高举着为保卫和平、民主、自由、独立而斗争的旗帜，表现了无可比拟的伟力、坚强的胜利信念与斗志。
    在这个“一切国家劳动人民斗争力量检阅的日子”，苏联共产党中央号召一切国家的劳动人民联合起来，“揭露新战争煽动者的侵略阴谋，警卫和平”，“摧毁帝国主义束缚与奴役各国人民的计划”。当天，全苏各地到处狂欢地举行庆祝集会与大游行。苏联武装部队与首都百万群众，在红场举行大检阅。一队队机群翱翔天空，一队队大炮、坦克、装甲车、摩托、骑兵疾驰而过，百万参加者汇成一股巨流，欢呼与歌唱声震响大地，显现着苏联人民不可被战胜的雄伟气概与威力。
    东欧新民主主义各国的千百万劳动人民，纷纷举行集会与庆祝游行，他们欢快而满怀信心地欢呼：“人民国家为地上天堂”、“努力走向社会主义”、“巩固世界和平与民主”、“感谢并尽忠于人民共和国”。
    在资本主义世界中的劳动人民、不顾恫吓与压迫，在节日向国内反动派与美帝等外国奴役者实行战斗大示威。巴黎百万工人与罗马的十万劳动人民，在争取和平、面包、自由、独立的口号下，举行了空前盛大的集会游行。柏林七十万人民游行要求：“给德国人民以统一、和平、自由与独立！”在美占领军当局协助日宪警实行警戒与弹压下，东京仍有百万劳动人民举行反对芦田反动政府的示威游行。美国纽约等城，亦举行了反对战争狂、反对征兵与反劳工法的示威。示威游行的风暴同样席卷英、荷、比、奥、印尼、印度等国。
    中国人民则以自豪与兴奋的心情，祝贺这一“走向全国胜利的日子”。为全国人民希望所寄的中共中央，于节日发表的口号中，指出：“蒋介石做伪总统，就是他快要上断头台的预兆。”并向各民主党派、人民团体与社会贤达发出了振奋人心的召唤：“迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表会议，成立民主联合政府！”
    本周在东方值得注意的另一件大事，便是朝鲜人民为独立、民主与统一的战斗大团结。代表一千多万有组织人民的南北鲜民主党派团体联席会议，业已胜利闭幕。会议已决定对美帝在南鲜一手包办的分裂伪选，展开全国性的抵制运动。南鲜总工会代表在会上表示南鲜工人将作模范，一个也不去参加伪选。同时，南鲜人民的抵制伪选斗争正在兴起，尽管美驻军当局施尽威吓与暴力镇压等一切卑劣手段，但决不能使南鲜人民屈服。鲜人传统的不屈精神，也表现在最近旅日鲜侨反对美日当局压迫的英勇斗争上。鲜侨以赤手空拳对付武装宪警，曾攻入县府，并举行大示威，有这样团结性与战斗性的朝鲜人民，其前途是无限光明的。
