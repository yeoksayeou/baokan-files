　　Adding Capital to Renovate Storefronts
  　Handan Merchants Operate with Confidence
    [Handan News] Previously, merchants in Handan City were unclear about the policy regarding industry and commerce and harbored many doubts. They believed that accumulating too much wealth would lead to struggle sessions, so some merchants were unenthusiastic about their businesses, opening only one section of their storefronts and hesitating to display goods on shelves. Recently, after the government issued two announcements and held several merchant conferences to explain the policies, all those who had been wrongly struggled against had their property returned. Businesses under government management were also returned to their original owners to operate, as long as they were willing to do so. In public-private partnerships, the public side also withdrew its shares, allowing private individuals to develop their businesses themselves. As a result, merchants added capital and renovated storefronts. Ruicheng Flower Shop increased its capital from 950,000 to 2.2 million, and Dacheng Flower Shop increased from 300,000 to 1 million, both increasing threefold. Currently, over 250 businesses are registering. At the beginning of the new market, 30 vendors built new houses. Now, 90 vendors have started operating, and many are still building houses and erecting reed mats. Feng Maoshen, a vendor in the West Market, did not dare to do business last year, often saying, "Having enough to eat is enough! It's useless to accumulate too much wealth. If I accidentally offend a colleague and someone gives me a suggestion, I can't take it!" Now, it's different. This time, he built two houses in the new market and borrowed 200,000 from the bank. He said, "Now that road passes have been eliminated and taxes are unified, I really want to make it big." Manager Wang of Daxin Iron Factory on Heping East Avenue was worried last year when he heard rumors of struggle sessions, saying, "Just keep going forward. Each day that passes is less anxiety. Because I have several shareholders from private businesses in Beiping, the government took over my factory last year. At that time, I thought: anyway, I can still have a bowl of rice, and it saves me from worrying every day. Now that our government has returned the factory to my management, I understand the policies. I want to expand this pot-casting factory, because merchants all understand the policies. Now the market is much more lively." (Zheng Yan, Yang Chao, Gu Feng)

　　添本钱修门面
  　邯郸商人放心营业
    【邯郸消息】从前邯郸市的买卖人，因为对工商业政策弄不清楚，存着很多怀疑，认为购钱多了就要挨斗，所以有些商人就干得没劲，门面只开一扇，架上也不敢放货。近来经政府两次布告，并召开好几次商人大会解释政策，以前斗错了的一律退还，政府代管的只要有人，也都退还原主经营，公私伙干的买卖，公家也抽出了股金，让私人自己发展。这样一来，买卖人有的添了本钱，有的添了门面；瑞成花店由九十五万增到二百二十万元，大成花店由三十万增到一百万元，都增加了三倍；现在进行登记的有二百五十多家；新商场一开始，就有卅家摊贩都盖了新房子。现在有九十家摊贩已经干起来，有很多人还在盖房子搭席棚。西市场摊贩冯茂身，去年不敢干，常说：“有吃就算啦！弄得钱多了没用，一时对同行不好，给咱个意见可吃不住！”现在和以前不同了，这回在新商场先盖了两间房子，从银行贷了二十万元，他说：“如今路条取消了，票也统一啦，我真要大干了。”和平东大街上大新铁工厂的王经理，去年听到斗争风声，心里着忙说：“维持着朝前走吧，过一天先少三晌。因为我有几股东家，是北平的几家私商，所以去年政府就代管了我的工厂。那时我想：横竖是吃碗饭，倒省得每天提挂着心肠。如今咱政府把这工厂又交回我执掌，我明白了政策，我要扩大这铸锅工厂，因为商人都懂得了政策，现在市面热闹多了。（正奄、杨超、鼓峰）
